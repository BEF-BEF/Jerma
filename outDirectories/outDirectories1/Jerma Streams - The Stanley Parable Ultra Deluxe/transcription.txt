[5.75s -> 22.50s]  Nope. I'm here. Nope. Told you. What's going on? How you doing? Hey, what's up? On time, yeah.
[22.50s -> 39.91s]  For once. The one and only time I will ever be on time. No, that's not true. So we had a plan today,
[39.91s -> 49.94s]  but the plan kind of got changed a little. Just a little. I was gonna do Stanley Parable and then
[49.94s -> 54.81s]  Infomercials or Infomercials and then Stanley Parable. But it has been brought to my attention
[56.01s -> 64.95s]  that the Stanley Parable Deluxe Mode is way longer than an hour or two. I played the old one from 10
[64.95s -> 70.84s]  years ago and I remember after like an hour or two I was like, oh okay. So this is way more than just
[70.84s -> 81.14s]  like a graphical update. This is apparently a, there's a ton of new stuff. So it's about,
[81.14s -> 84.82s]  it could be about four to six hours. Yeah. So this is probably going to take the whole stream.
[85.46s -> 100.78s]  But that's cool. That's all right. I played for about seven hours, seven and a half. So Infomercials
[100.78s -> 106.90s]  are going to be tomorrow. We'll go tomorrow. We'll do Infomercials for like, well, maybe three or four
[106.90s -> 114.78s]  hours tomorrow. So I'm going to split it up. So instead of one eight hour stream where I play
[114.78s -> 120.44s]  Stanley Parable for three hours and then Infomercials for three hours, I'm going to break it up. I'll do
[120.44s -> 126.36s]  Stanley Parable as long as I feel like playing today. Try to see everything I want to see maybe.
[126.36s -> 139.61s]  And then just Infomercials tomorrow. What about inscription? I am, I'm going to be playing
[139.61s -> 153.88s]  inscription on my off time. I feel like I would enjoy it more. That means he's never playing it
[153.88s -> 161.00s]  again. No, that means I'm never streaming it again. Oh no, he said it. Oh, oh I said it.
[165.21s -> 176.33s]  We can, can we get, can we get a hernia update? Um, I don't think I really, oh health update,
[176.33s -> 185.06s]  sorry. Hey, can we get an update on the hernia dude? Maybe. I'm doing all right.
[187.21s -> 192.42s]  Still having issues. It hasn't never gone away. Didn't get better, didn't get worse. It's just
[192.42s -> 200.38s]  still there. I just don't talk about it. Why, why talk about it all the time and have every other
[200.38s -> 206.63s]  stream have like a down point, right? No. I'm doing all right. I'll be okay. Don't worry about me.
[207.43s -> 212.63s]  There are a few options that I have to consider over the next six, 12 months.
[213.35s -> 218.89s]  I might do a few procedures. I have actually, I have an appointment coming up to talk about
[218.89s -> 226.90s]  these very things. Am I going to just go get hernia surgery? Am I going to do a intercostal
[226.90s -> 232.26s]  nerve block? These are the things that I could do. These things that are options to see if it can
[232.26s -> 242.60s]  kind of get rid of it. I don't know. I would be lying to you if I didn't say that the three or
[242.60s -> 249.14s]  four months I took off from streaming and I didn't solve the problem was a little demoralizing,
[249.14s -> 255.46s]  if I'm honest, because, you know, I'm like, oh, I'll be, I'm just going to go to the doctor like
[255.46s -> 262.78s]  fucking 20 times and figure this out. Didn't happen. I might have kind of figured it out.
[262.78s -> 271.13s]  We'll find out, but it's going to take some major, I want to say lifestyle changes and
[271.93s -> 275.21s]  potential procedures, like maybe a surgical procedure to see if it works.
[276.55s -> 281.67s]  What? There's your update. I'm fine. I'm drinking green tea. I got green tea coursing through my
[281.67s -> 297.85s]  veins. Am I allowed? I turned myself up. Am I allowed now? Am I good? Black tea is better.
[302.06s -> 316.28s]  What? I can't stop laughing. What the fuck? Oh, fuck, dude. I was laughing so hard at what
[316.28s -> 321.69s]  you just said. I can't believe you just said that. It was so funny what you said. No, they're both
[321.69s -> 332.74s]  good. I'm not a tea elitist. I'm not a coffee elitist. I drink Folgers and I drink the expensive
[332.74s -> 340.14s]  stuff. I drink green tea and I drink like Lipton black tea out of the little bag thing. You know
[340.14s -> 353.85s]  what I mean? I like it. I enjoy all these things. You're a tea centrist. Call me whatever you want.
[354.65s -> 360.34s]  Call me whatever you want. I know what I am up here. And that is an enjoyer of all things.
[361.22s -> 367.14s]  Okay. You can call me whatever you want. That's your opinion. Your opinion is not my opinion.
[367.14s -> 375.45s]  And my opinion is my own fact. Get dunked on. Are you guys ready to play before I like embarrass
[375.45s -> 391.08s]  myself in the pre-stream anymore? Here we go. Okay. Stanley Parable. Deluxe edition. Ultra deluxe,
[391.08s -> 398.23s]  I think is what it's actually called. Would I call you my husband? No, that would be fucking weird.
[400.20s -> 411.72s]  No, that'd be odd. Okay. Why do I? Do you guys ever go? Okay. Does anybody just sit at their
[411.72s -> 417.93s]  setup? And it's been the same exact thing for potentially years, but something just fucking
[417.93s -> 422.49s]  does it. Something just doesn't feel right. I feel like I'm just, I'm like, I'm uncomfortable. Why?
[422.49s -> 429.00s]  I'm like, like the seats, I'm like, no, I hate it. Like what's going on here? Why do I feel like
[429.00s -> 436.28s]  this? Like I'm, my seat's too low and my seat's too high. There's not enough cushion. There's too
[436.28s -> 441.50s]  much cushion. The armrests are in the wrong place. I can't like grab the mouse. I can't move. This
[441.50s -> 446.34s]  sucks. I don't know what, nothing happened. Nothing changed. This has been the same. Look, I feel like
[446.34s -> 454.74s]  I'm floating around. What's happening? Stop gaslighting yourself and just play the game.
[454.74s -> 472.98s]  This is going to be, you've changed. I'm kidding. That was a fucking joke finger. What's wrong with
[472.98s -> 483.85s]  this? Hold on. Okay. My feet are not touching the ground. You understand what I'm saying? My feet are
[483.85s -> 494.94s]  not touching the ground right now, but they did yesterday, but that doesn't feel right either. Now
[494.94s -> 502.46s]  my, now my knees are like up. I'm like too far down. I don't know what I did. This doesn't feel
[502.46s -> 511.91s]  right. Shit doesn't feel right. That feels a little better. That's a little bit better. I might move a
[511.91s -> 518.94s]  couple things. Not yet though. All right. I think I'm all right. I think we can go. I know everyone's
[518.94s -> 521.98s]  going to backseat me in this game and it's, uh, people are going to tell me like, go in that door,
[521.98s -> 527.78s]  go in that door. You're just going to get fucking banned like for a year. If you say even one,
[527.78s -> 534.10s]  if you say the word like go and then like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah door, you're going to get
[534.10s -> 538.50s]  timed out for like fucking two years. Just want to let, make sure you know that. Uh, if, if people
[538.50s -> 542.58s]  get too crazy about it, we're going to put an emote only mode and like, you're going to get banned
[542.58s -> 551.22s]  for a year. There you go. I scared them. Now they won't do it. This is the story of a man named
[551.78s -> 556.82s]  I remember that I played this like 10 years ago. I remember this for a company in a big building
[556.82s -> 561.38s]  where he was employee number four, two, seven, going to our number four, two, nine first,
[561.38s -> 568.34s]  stupid job was simple. He sat at his desk in room four, two, seven, and he pushed buttons on a
[568.34s -> 574.34s]  keyboard orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push,
[574.42s -> 581.30s]  how long to push them, and in what order. This is what employee four, two, seven did every day
[581.30s -> 587.62s]  of every month of every year. And although others might've considered it soul renting,
[587.62s -> 594.18s]  Stanley, every moment that the orders came in as though he had been made exactly for this job.
[595.14s -> 602.79s]  And Stanley was happy. Stanley decided to get up and go this way. One day something very peculiar
[602.79s -> 609.61s]  happened. Something that would forever change Stanley, something he would never quite forget.
[609.61s -> 616.09s]  He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived
[616.09s -> 622.01s]  on the monitor for him to follow. No one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting,
[622.01s -> 629.13s]  or even say hi. Never in all his years at the company had this happened. This complete
[629.13s -> 634.09s]  isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. This is your day when you're not screaming.
[634.09s -> 638.89s]  Frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.
[639.45s -> 644.81s]  But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out
[644.81s -> 666.82s]  of his office. F1. Okay, I think maybe I should press F1. All right, the FOV is at 90, but it
[666.82s -> 677.53s]  kind of feels like it's too high for me. Is that weird to say? It is too high. Yeah, it's like too
[677.53s -> 686.98s]  high. Hold on. Now I'm showing you like 85 maybe. That feels a little better. Yeah, it was a little
[686.98s -> 693.96s]  too much. You should leave the room. I'm going to do whatever I want to do in the Stanley Parable
[693.96s -> 704.82s]  ultra deluxe mode, okay? But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure. What if he had to
[704.82s -> 710.18s]  make a decision? What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility? He had never been trained
[710.18s -> 716.90s]  for that. No, this couldn't go any way except badly. The thing to do now, Stanley thought to himself,
[716.90s -> 723.86s]  is to wait. Nothing will hurt me. Nothing will break me. And here I can be happy forever.
[724.50s -> 731.86s]  I will be happy. So Stanley waited. In 15 minutes, am I going to get... Had years gone by,
[731.86s -> 736.90s]  he no longer had the ability to tell. But the one thing he knew for sure beyond any doubt... It's
[736.90s -> 741.46s]  been two minutes. ...was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come. Eventually,
[741.46s -> 748.50s]  someday they would arrive. Soon, very soon now, this will end. He will be spoken to.
[748.50s -> 755.93s]  Then in one minute. He will be told what to do. Now it's just a little bit closer. Now it's even
[755.93s -> 773.34s]  closer. Here it comes. What? But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure. I'm not going
[773.34s -> 778.22s]  anywhere. He had to make a decision. What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility?
[778.30s -> 784.70s]  He hasn't been trained for that. No, this couldn't go any way except badly. The thing to do now,
[784.70s -> 791.10s]  Stanley thought to himself, is to wait. Nothing will hurt me. Nothing will break me. And here I
[791.10s -> 800.06s]  can be happy forever. I will be happy. Stanley waited. Hours passed. Then days... Had years
[800.06s -> 806.14s]  gone by, he no longer had the ability to tell. But the one thing he knew for sure beyond any doubt
[806.14s -> 812.22s]  was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come. Eventually, someday they would arrive.
[812.22s -> 817.90s]  I don't know, I thought it was gonna be... Soon, very soon now, this will end. He will be spoken to.
[817.90s -> 825.86s]  He will be told what to do. Now it's just a little bit closer. After a hundred cycles... Don't say
[825.86s -> 846.82s]  that. Here it comes. Okay, so if I close the door, I get a funny ending. I can't open 428. I can't
[846.82s -> 852.90s]  open 429. All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting
[852.90s -> 858.92s]  room. Perhaps he had simply missed a memo. Okay, everybody's gone. No matter how hard Stanley looked,
[858.92s -> 863.48s]  Stanley went around touching every little thing in the office. He did. But it didn't make a single
[863.48s -> 870.84s]  difference. Nor did it advance the story in any way. Yeah, but you never know. That's why, can I
[870.84s -> 877.62s]  just say, I do appreciate when devs have like a point-and-click adventure game and like stuff
[877.62s -> 882.58s]  kind of glows, right? Like, oh, there's like a thing you can touch over here. It glows. Rather
[882.58s -> 891.08s]  than have nothing there. And you just have to... And then this draw on the bottom opens. Like,
[892.15s -> 897.19s]  I don't know. Like, I like when things glow. So like, don't tell me what to do with it,
[897.19s -> 902.70s]  but just tell me that I can interact with it. Like, oh look, it's interactable. Rather than
[902.70s -> 906.78s]  just walk around and do that. Okay. But no, this is cool. So, all right, everyone's gone. I can't
[906.78s -> 913.43s]  go in 437. I can't go in 430. This doesn't matter. Just go. Close all doors behind you. So, the
[914.07s -> 933.27s]  amnesia monster does not get us. Okay. I'm stuck in here. 425, 425. This office is fucked up. What
[933.27s -> 940.41s]  is going on here? What does that say? Would that say? I probably shouldn't have done that.
[941.05s -> 956.31s]  Awaiting input. Input received. More? Do I have to touch all the computers? Do I do it again?
[957.64s -> 972.01s]  Input received. All right. I got it. Does that do anything for me? Okay. Uh, spill. I hate Mondays.
[972.57s -> 986.54s]  417. Nope. You got to break it up a little bit, man. Like if I ever had an office complex,
[986.54s -> 991.56s]  you got to break it up a little bit. When Stanley came to a set of two open doors,
[991.56s -> 999.43s]  he entered the door on his left. No, he didn't. He entered the door on his right. I, yeah. Where
[999.43s -> 1021.75s]  am I going to go? I wasn't going to defy the narrator. No, I'm going left. Yet there was not
[1021.75s -> 1028.15s]  a single person here either. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his
[1028.15s -> 1033.43s]  boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there. This looks like the whiteboard that we had
[1033.43s -> 1043.08s]  for the dollhouse meetings. Oh, like this, this is kind of what we were doing. Yeah. All right.
[1043.08s -> 1056.68s]  Cool. Business meeting. We, everyone is unique. You, most of all. Me? Synergize core value
[1056.68s -> 1067.16s]  expenditures. Shift global market. I've read. Monetize free to play. What do people want?
[1067.16s -> 1071.48s]  Things. Money. More money. Things, but with money to buy more things. Graphs. Graphs about things
[1071.48s -> 1077.26s]  and money. Stock market is somewhere here. Call it in segments. Stripes. Requires more secondary
[1077.26s -> 1086.25s]  research. What is hot? Profits. I don't know. You know, sometimes I feel like these big executive
[1086.25s -> 1094.26s]  board meetings are just kind of nap time when you were fucking five years old. They all come
[1094.26s -> 1099.13s]  in here and they shake hands. They're like, Oh yes. How are you doing? Yeah. Michael, Michael,
[1099.13s -> 1103.13s]  good to see you again. Yeah. Profits are up. They are. They sure. And they're like, it's like
[1103.21s -> 1109.10s]  sleeping bags all over the ground and they like are getting in. Yep. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. We could
[1109.10s -> 1114.79s]  fire like four or 500 more people. Yeah. I think that would be a decent idea. Yeah. Okay. You go.
[1114.79s -> 1120.82s]  Yeah. Say hello to the wife and kids for me. And they're all just fucking sleeping in sleeping
[1120.82s -> 1127.02s]  bags here for like two hours. And then they get up and they leave and they shake hands and they say
[1127.02s -> 1136.14s]  thanks. What happens in these board meetings? Like what even happens in them? No, I wasn't done. I
[1136.14s -> 1144.07s]  wasn't done with my board meeting to rant. Come on, man. Stanley stepped into the broom closet,
[1144.07s -> 1148.23s]  but there was nothing here. So he turned around and got back on track.
[1148.23s -> 1156.15s]  Somebody just comes in with like eight glasses of milk, like carrots and broccoli, raw carrots
[1156.15s -> 1170.25s]  and raw broccoli. There was nothing here. No choice to make, no path to follow. Am I stuck in here?
[1170.25s -> 1174.01s]  Empty broom closet. No, that's bullshit. No reason to still be here. Oh, that's bullshit. There's
[1174.01s -> 1184.74s]  something in here. It was baffling that Stanley was still just sitting in the broom closet.
[1184.74s -> 1189.78s]  He wasn't even doing anything. At least if there was something to interact with, he'd be justified
[1189.78s -> 1199.32s]  in some way as it is. He's literally just standing there doing sweet F.A. F.A. forensic analysis.
[1201.93s -> 1206.17s]  Are you, are you really still in the broom closet? Yes. Standing around doing nothing.
[1206.73s -> 1212.01s]  Why? Please offer me some explanation here. I'm, I'm genuinely confused. I got a very important
[1212.01s -> 1215.85s]  board meeting going on. Don't you understand? We're talking about, we're talking about what
[1215.85s -> 1221.43s]  we're going to do in the third quarter. You do realize there's no choice or anything in here,
[1221.43s -> 1227.19s]  right? If I'd said Stanley walked past the broom closet, at least she would have had a reason for
[1227.19s -> 1232.71s]  exploring it to find that. But it didn't even occur to me because literally this closet is of
[1232.71s -> 1238.87s]  absolutely no significance to the story whatsoever. Oh yeah, that joke. I never would have thought to
[1238.87s -> 1245.80s]  mention it. Oh, there it goes. They let him out of the park. Oh yes, I'm in a board meeting and
[1245.80s -> 1252.06s]  we're awful shitty people. Oh, there it goes. See you later. Go talk about this with your
[1252.06s -> 1259.58s]  friends or say, Oh, did you get the broom closet ending? The broom closet ending was my favorite.
[1260.30s -> 1271.16s]  I hope your friends find this concerning. Don't read auto mod. I'm not really, really stupid.
[1271.16s -> 1276.04s]  Hey, he probably only got the job because of a family connection. That's how stupid he is
[1276.04s -> 1279.96s]  that all with drug money. Also, Stanley is addicted to drugs and hookers.
[1281.08s -> 1289.32s]  Well, I've come to a very definite conclusion about what's going on right now.
[1290.12s -> 1295.56s]  You're dead. You got to this broom closet, explored it a bit. And we're just about to leave
[1295.56s -> 1300.04s]  because there's nothing. Am I dead in here? Physical melody of some sort shut down your
[1300.04s -> 1305.32s]  central nervous system and you collapsed on the keyboard. Well, in a situation like this,
[1305.32s -> 1310.92s]  the responsible thing is to alert someone nearby so as to ensure that your body is taken care of
[1310.92s -> 1318.52s]  before it begins to decompose. Hello. Anyone who happens to be nearby, the person at this computer
[1318.52s -> 1325.00s]  is dead. They have fallen prey to any number of your countless human physiological vulnerabilities.
[1325.00s -> 1331.00s]  It's indicative of the long-term sustainability of your species. Please remove their corpse from
[1331.00s -> 1337.00s]  the area and instruct another human to take their place, making sure they understand basic
[1337.00s -> 1342.36s]  first-person video game mechanics and filling them in on the history of narrative tropes in
[1342.36s -> 1349.00s]  video gaming so that the irony and insightful commentary of this game is not lost on them.
[1349.88s -> 1352.76s]  All right. When you've done that, just step out into the hallway.
[1353.72s -> 1359.64s]  Oh, dude, look at that one. Oh, there it goes in the left field.
[1368.42s -> 1383.94s]  What if I don't go anywhere? Oh, he's fucking killing it today. Do I actually just, I might
[1383.94s -> 1400.55s]  just die in here. How many layers is the irony stream right now? Glad somebody got it. You
[1400.55s -> 1414.14s]  understand. You understand comedy. What? I don't want to leave though. Don't I? I kind of want to
[1414.14s -> 1419.91s]  can anything happen in here? Ah, second player. It's good to have you on board. I guarantee you
[1419.91s -> 1427.72s]  can't do any worse than the person who came before you. You too. Unbelievable. I'm at the
[1427.72s -> 1433.00s]  mercy of an entire species of invalids. Perhaps there's a monkey nearby you can hand the controls
[1433.00s -> 1439.08s]  to a fish fungus. Look, you can hammer out the details. I'm not particularly picky. I'll just
[1439.08s -> 1444.04s]  be waiting for when you're ready to pick up the story again. Really? Okay. What if I do it a third
[1444.04s -> 1460.02s]  time? I can't do it a third time. Maybe I can. Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs
[1460.02s -> 1479.82s]  to his boss's office. Now I went downstairs. Have a flashlight. Stanley just couldn't do it. He
[1479.82s -> 1485.02s]  considered the possibility of facing his boss, admitting he had left his post during work hours.
[1487.18s -> 1493.42s]  And in such a competitive economy, why had he taken that risk? All because he believed everyone
[1493.42s -> 1500.06s]  had vanished. His boss would think he was crazy. And then something occurred to Stanley. Maybe he
[1500.14s -> 1506.78s]  thought to himself, maybe I am crazy. All of my coworkers blinking mysteriously out of existence
[1506.78s -> 1513.50s]  in a single moment for no reason at all. None of it made any logical sense. And as Stanley pondered
[1513.50s -> 1520.14s]  this, he began to make other strange observations. For example, why couldn't he see his feet when he
[1520.14s -> 1525.90s]  looked down? Why did dogs close automatically behind him wherever he went? That's true. What's
[1525.90s -> 1530.54s]  going on here? These rooms were starting to look pretty familiar. Were they simply repeating?
[1531.10s -> 1536.78s]  No, Stanley said to himself, this is all too strange. This can't be real. And at last he
[1536.78s -> 1542.46s]  came to the conclusion that had been on the tip of his tongue. He just hadn't found the words for it.
[1542.46s -> 1549.50s]  I'm dreaming. Yes, I'm dreaming. One, two, three, four. This is all a dream. Oh, what a relief
[1549.50s -> 1555.58s]  Stanley felt to have finally found an answer, an explanation. His coworkers weren't actually
[1555.58s -> 1562.62s]  gone. He wasn't going to lose his job. He wasn't crazy after all. And he thought to himself, I suppose I'll wake
[1562.62s -> 1569.26s]  up soon. I'll have to go back to my boring real life job pushing buttons. I may as well enjoy this while I'm
[1569.26s -> 1576.06s]  still lucid. So he imagined himself lying and began to gently float above the ground.
[1576.14s -> 1581.58s]  What? Then he imagined himself soaring through space on a magical starfield.
[1583.26s -> 1590.30s]  It was so much fun. And Stanley marveled that he had still not woken up. How was he remaining so
[1590.30s -> 1597.10s]  lucid? And then perhaps the strangest question of them all entered Stanley's head. One, he was amazed
[1597.10s -> 1604.14s]  he hadn't asked himself sooner. Why is there a voice in my head dictating everything that I'm doing and
[1604.14s -> 1609.82s]  thinking? Now the voice was describing itself being considered by Stanley who found it
[1609.82s -> 1615.74s]  particularly strange. What the fuck? I'm dreaming about a voice describing me thinking about how
[1615.74s -> 1621.74s]  it's describing my thoughts, he thought. And while he thought it all very odd. That just reminded me of like a
[1621.74s -> 1628.14s]  YouTubers or Twitch streamers play the game compilation that sometimes people make like devs or
[1628.14s -> 1632.94s]  like companies whatever. Was Stanley simply deceiving himself? Believing that if he's asleep he doesn't
[1632.94s -> 1638.46s]  have to take responsibility for himself? That's the cut. Stanley is as awake right now as he's
[1638.46s -> 1644.26s]  ever been in his life. Now hearing the voice speak these words. So where do I go? Shocked to Stanley.
[1644.90s -> 1650.42s]  After all he knew for certain beyond a doubt that this was in fact a dream. Did the voice not see
[1650.42s -> 1655.46s]  him float and make the magical stars just a moment ago? How else would the voice explain all that?
[1655.46s -> 1662.74s]  This voice was a part of himself too. Surely, surely if he could just. He would prove it. He would
[1662.74s -> 1670.46s]  prove that he was in control. That this was a dream. So he closed his eyes gently and he invited
[1670.46s -> 1676.30s]  himself to wake up. This works. He felt the cool weight of the blanket on his skin. The press of
[1676.30s -> 1680.70s]  the mattress on his back. Can you guys change channels? I can. Fresh air of a world outside
[1680.70s -> 1689.30s]  this one. Let me wake up. He thought to himself. I'm through with this dream. I wish it to be over.
[1690.18s -> 1696.74s]  Let me go back to my job. Let me continue pushing the buttons. Please. It's all I want.
[1697.61s -> 1705.93s]  I want my apartment and my wife and my job. All I want is my life exactly the way it's always been.
[1707.34s -> 1717.14s]  My life is normal. I am normal. Everything will be fine. I am okay.
[1723.13s -> 1730.97s]  Oh, it's not a dream. Stanley began screaming. Please someone wake me up. My name is Stanley.
[1730.97s -> 1736.97s]  I have a boss. I have an office. I am real. Please just someone tell me I'm real. I must be real.
[1736.97s -> 1751.06s]  I must be. Can anyone hear my voice? Who am I? Who am I? And everything went black. This is the story
[1751.06s -> 1759.61s]  of a woman named Mariela. Mariela woke up on a day like any other. She arose, got dressed,
[1759.61s -> 1764.57s]  gathered her belongings, and walked to her place of work. But on this particular day,
[1764.57s -> 1770.09s]  her walk was interrupted by the body of a man who had stumbled through town talking and screaming
[1770.09s -> 1775.05s]  to himself. Wait, what? Collapsed dead on the sidewalk. And although she would soon turn to
[1775.05s -> 1781.53s]  go call for an ambulance for just a few brief moments, she considered the strange man. He was
[1781.53s -> 1787.85s]  obviously crazy. This much she knew. Everyone knows what crazy... Lost to Mariela? And in that
[1787.85s -> 1795.29s]  moment, she thought to herself how lucky she was to be normal. I am sane. I am in control of my
[1795.29s -> 1803.29s]  mind. I know what is real and what isn't. It was comforting to think this. And in a certain way,
[1803.29s -> 1808.39s]  seeing this man made her feel better. But then she remembered the meeting she had scheduled
[1808.39s -> 1813.99s]  for that day. The very important people whose impressions of her would affect her career,
[1813.99s -> 1820.71s]  and by extension, the rest of her life. She had no time for this. So it was only a moment that she
[1820.71s -> 1831.24s]  stood there, staring down at the body. And then she turned and ran. What happened to me? Why did
[1831.24s -> 1840.01s]  I just die? Why would I just die? Okay, well, we're not going down there again. All of his
[1840.01s -> 1845.77s]  coworkers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room. Perhaps he had
[1845.77s -> 1856.63s]  simply missed a memo. This time I'm going right. Stanley came to a set of two open doors.
[1866.36s -> 1872.76s]  Yet there was not a single person here either. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to
[1872.76s -> 1877.56s]  go up to his boss's office. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1877.80s -> 1881.72s]  not again. I won't be part of this. I'm not going to encourage you. I'm not going to say
[1881.72s -> 1886.76s]  anything at all. I'm just going to be patient and wait for you to finish whatever it is you
[1886.76s -> 1901.34s]  enjoy doing so much in this room. Please take your time. I'm such a little, I'm such a good toddler.
[1903.58s -> 1909.18s]  I didn't do it. Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office,
[1916.42s -> 1925.45s]  weird office, executive bathroom, because the boss knows that what the boss says goes if the
[1925.45s -> 1937.14s]  boss suffered losses, then that's what the boss chose. Who wrote this? I, no toilet next to a
[1937.14s -> 1948.50s]  window. I'm sorry. I don't want, I don't care how high up I am. No thanks. You know, I feel the same
[1948.50s -> 1955.96s]  exact way about the hotel room. Look at this big curtain. Wow. Look at this, all the view. You can
[1955.96s -> 1965.34s]  see like the whole city from here. Now I could close that shit immediately. Close it immediately.
[1965.34s -> 1970.70s]  I don't want that open. What have you taken a shit? What are you like naked? I closed that.
[1970.70s -> 1977.77s]  I don't fucking, I, that freaks me out so much. I hate that. Oh, it's just a huge window here.
[1977.77s -> 1980.97s]  I don't want to even look in my fucking hotel room. I don't want to look at my bathroom. Like,
[1980.97s -> 1990.31s]  what the fuck is this? You want a good, you want a view. All right, here, install like a little
[1990.31s -> 1994.31s]  wizard of Oz slider. You know, like, wait, munchkin land. Now you can't come in here.
[1994.95s -> 1998.87s]  Just like a, so you can just put your eyes out. Oh, wow. That's cool.
[1999.83s -> 2016.86s]  This does the same thing. It does the exact same thing. We don't need all this.
[2016.86s -> 2024.86s]  Show your pants. No, no, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't show you my pants. All right.
[2024.86s -> 2038.22s]  Fine. Okay. All right. Fine. All right. Fine. All right. It's, it's, it's Super Mario. Okay.
[2039.82s -> 2055.99s]  You see, there's Super Mario pajamas. Okay. Are you happy? Are you happy? Okay. There's Super
[2055.99s -> 2076.34s]  Mario pajamas. Don't you guys get it? I just have, you just have to, I just have to be presentable
[2076.34s -> 2087.59s]  from here up. I just have, my fly is not down. It's buttoned. You know how many times I've had
[2087.59s -> 2104.60s]  a nice shirt on and wearing like in little like pajama, like shorts a lot. All that matters is
[2104.60s -> 2130.36s]  like this camera right here. Right. That's all that matters. What the fuck? Holy shit. Okay.
[2130.36s -> 2136.68s]  I didn't think that was a panda until like a second ago. The nose of the panda I thought was
[2136.68s -> 2145.62s]  a mouth going like this. Like I didn't, and the black I thought was a background. I was like,
[2145.62s -> 2157.06s]  what is that? I thought it was like a face. The nose is like an open kind of mouth. I,
[2157.06s -> 2165.99s]  that was fucking weird. You can see it. Yeah. Of course you can. No, I'm not going up there. Not
[2165.99s -> 2180.47s]  yet. Anything else I can touch in here? Anything I can do? What about over here? Stepping into
[2180.47s -> 2185.43s]  his manager's office, Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any
[2185.43s -> 2192.95s]  human life. Shocked, unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this? What dark secret
[2192.95s -> 2198.87s]  was being held from him? What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk
[2198.87s -> 2204.87s]  guarded the terrible truth that his boss had been keeping from him. And so the boss had assigned it
[2204.87s -> 2224.12s]  an extra secret. Really? Oh. But of course, Stanley couldn't possibly have known this.
[2224.12s -> 2231.26s]  How did he get it? Stanley just sat around twiddling his thumbs, trying to input anything on
[2231.26s -> 2236.46s]  the device was useless since he could never possibly know that the combination was two eight
[2236.46s -> 2248.55s]  four five. I don't know. I can't get it. Two eight four five. I don't know. You're not supposed to
[2248.55s -> 2258.78s]  be listening to you. You could pull this whole room forward in the Sims building tool and it's
[2258.78s -> 2266.52s]  still the office is fine. What's the point of all this? Just go over here. Emergency override
[2266.52s -> 2272.76s]  kicked in and the door just opened all by itself and Stanley got the hell along with the story.
[2272.76s -> 2299.45s]  Well, what did you do? What the fuck? I got it. What was he hiding? What's this big secret?
[2300.09s -> 2316.42s]  Really dark. I can't see anything. What's the secret? You don't want to know, man.
[2322.28s -> 2328.28s]  Descending deeper into the building, Stanley realized he felt a bit peculiar. It was a stirring
[2328.28s -> 2334.12s]  of emotion in his chest as though he felt more free to think for himself, to question the nature
[2334.12s -> 2341.08s]  of his job. Why did he feel this now when for years it had never occurred to him? This question
[2341.08s -> 2351.64s]  would not go unanswered for long. Stanley noticed that there was a place to jump halfway down the
[2351.64s -> 2356.98s]  elevator. He jumped very excitedly, landed on the ledge and was disappointed to find it was just a
[2356.98s -> 2367.35s]  grace mimic. Just a grace mimic. Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read
[2367.35s -> 2398.58s]  mind control facility. Is this where I put the helmet on and see all the all the mutants? The
[2398.58s -> 2404.10s]  lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens. What horrible secret did
[2404.10s -> 2409.46s]  this place hold? Stanley thought to himself. Did he have the strength to find out?
[2410.34s -> 2416.97s]  What's going on here? Hold on. I gotta for the for the streamer and youtuber supercut. Hold on.
[2418.62s -> 2431.94s]  I gotta make a good one. Make sure I get on it. Now the monitors jumped to life. Whoa.
[2433.30s -> 2439.54s]  Each bore the number of an employee in the building. Oh my god. The lives of what the
[2439.70s -> 2452.01s]  fuck? That wasn't good enough. That was that was not good enough.
[2453.19s -> 2458.34s]  I can't swear you're right. No I can swear but they'll do they'll do this. It'll be like
[2459.32s -> 2484.33s]  what the I always find like censoring like fuck or like shit. It's like you hear the first two
[2484.33s -> 2491.56s]  letters and the last letter it's like what you're just essentially censoring a letter
[2491.56s -> 2506.02s]  like ready for instance what it like you why does it matter fuck fuck fuck right like it doesn't
[2506.02s -> 2514.79s]  matter you literally like shit you know what I'm saying like it's literally the eye and shit is
[2514.79s -> 2530.46s]  being removed who cares it doesn't make any sense kids will learn get your kids off of
[2530.46s -> 2537.42s]  youtube immediately do right now get your kids off of youtube now like do it today get them off
[2537.42s -> 2544.14s]  there immediately and get them out of here too get them out of here no you don't want them here
[2544.14s -> 2549.66s]  it's too horrible to believe it couldn't be true had stanley really been under someone's control
[2549.66s -> 2555.26s]  all this time was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job that his emotions had
[2555.26s -> 2563.08s]  been manipulated to accept it blindly well we need much more high quality children's television
[2563.56s -> 2573.30s]  okay we need children's television like in children's content like holy shit what a disaster
[2573.30s -> 2582.71s]  can you imagine auto auto's grotto like one of the segments it's like auto sitting at a table
[2583.51s -> 2587.96s]  and it's like a counting segment you know like and there's this this five there's five treats
[2588.52s -> 2595.06s]  on the table and it's like oh auto hey can you count with us auto he's like yeah I can count
[2595.06s -> 2599.88s]  with you absolutely my name's auto it's like how many treats are on the table and he goes
[2601.05s -> 2614.65s]  oh one two three four auto count again auto there you try again no just four one two three
[2615.21s -> 2618.81s]  and then he eats the fifth one four then it goes like
[2621.90s -> 2629.93s]  and then it like zooms in and it's like a cute thing how do we teach kids counting
[2629.93s -> 2637.37s]  he refused to believe it he couldn't accept it his own life in someone else's control never
[2637.93s -> 2646.65s]  it was unthinkable wasn't it was it even possible had he truly spent his entire life utterly blind
[2646.65s -> 2664.86s]  to the world this is getting intense man whoa intense was the proof the heart of the operation
[2664.94s -> 2673.34s]  controls labeled with emotions happy or sad or content walking eating working all of it
[2673.34s -> 2679.90s]  monitored and commanded from this very place and as the cold reality of his past began to sink in
[2679.90s -> 2686.38s]  stanley decided that this machinery would never again exert its terrible power over another human
[2686.38s -> 2694.38s]  life for he would dismantle the controls once and for all but i could turn it right could i
[2694.38s -> 2705.62s]  turn it on i'm sorry not before my morning coffee i don't do anything before my coffee
[2707.26s -> 2726.25s]  i'll come back all right fine controls idle awaiting input and when at last he found the
[2726.25s -> 2733.13s]  source of the room's power he knew it was his duty his obligation to put an end to this horrible
[2733.13s -> 2750.92s]  place and to everything it stood for can i change this like do you have to be like eat like 20
[2750.92s -> 2770.01s]  more vegetables like i just make it down anyway what if it was just like like cigarettes are gross
[2771.46s -> 2783.19s]  right like oh cigarettes are gross yeah cigarettes are gross and eat 10 more broccoli
[2783.19s -> 2798.63s]  hey that was loud let people decide that on their own i'm fucking kidding blackness and a rising
[2798.71s -> 2811.88s]  chill of uncertainty i turned it off was it over yes he had won he had defeated the machine
[2812.60s -> 2818.44s]  unshackled himself from someone else's command freedom was mere moments away
[2819.48s -> 2826.52s]  and yet even as the immense door slowly opened stanley reflected on how many puzzles still lay
[2826.52s -> 2833.24s]  unsolved where had his co-workers gone how had he been freed from the machine's grasp
[2833.80s -> 2839.80s]  what other mysteries did this strange building hold but as sunlight streamed into the chamber
[2839.80s -> 2846.04s]  he realized none of this mattered to him for it was not knowledge or even power that he had been
[2846.04s -> 2854.44s]  seeking but happiness perhaps his goal had not been to understand but to let go no longer would
[2854.44s -> 2862.52s]  anyone tell him where to go what to do or how to feel whatever life he lives it will be his
[2863.40s -> 2871.48s]  and that was all he needed to know it was perhaps the only thing worth knowing stanley stepped
[2871.48s -> 2885.00s]  through the open door could i like mind control myself to know way more than i do like if i go put
[2885.00s -> 2888.68s]  if i go like go to that machine and i was like i'm gonna mind control myself and to know like every
[2888.68s -> 2908.30s]  language could that work it's not like the matrix no it wouldn't that's the matrix all right but
[2908.30s -> 2912.82s]  okay what if so what if i was like i was in the mind control machine and somebody walked over
[2912.82s -> 2920.74s]  was like you now know every language on earth what would happen would i come out of it like in the
[2920.74s -> 2928.89s]  i come out of the machine and i'm just like i don't know what do i do would you know it would
[2931.88s -> 2937.56s]  stanley felt the cool breeze upon his skin the feeling of liberation but what would you think
[2937.56s -> 2942.92s]  immense possibility you would think you knew every language on earth this was exactly the way
[2943.56s -> 2950.28s]  right now that things were meant to happen that's fucking funny and stanley was happy
[2953.05s -> 2970.78s]  so would i be would i pretend to understand french that's so stupid but when people were
[2970.86s -> 2981.32s]  like say something to me in french what would i do all right let's go and he decided to go to
[2981.32s -> 2985.88s]  the meeting room to check on his co-workers he never functioned well by himself all right so
[2985.88s -> 2990.04s]  we're gonna go we needed support and guidance from others i'm gonna go should i turn on the
[2990.04s -> 2999.29s]  machine it was terrifying to him you wouldn't know any new languages but everyone else thinks you
[2999.29s -> 3008.04s]  do came to a set of two open doors he entered the door on his left what all right i just i want to
[3008.28s -> 3019.14s]  i'm on i want to go see what happens yet there was not a single person here either
[3019.78s -> 3026.10s]  feeling a wave of disbelief hey decided to go up to his boss's office hoping he might find an
[3026.10s -> 3034.74s]  answer there that's funny that's funny good one that's a good one coming to a staircase i want
[3034.74s -> 3039.78s]  to go and he walked upstairs to his boss's office i want to go up because i want to press the other
[3039.78s -> 3071.51s]  button wait what did where does this go this is i didn't do this should i go up or down i remember
[3071.51s -> 3078.07s]  i was in an elevator one elevator one time and this like mom and her little girl came in
[3079.13s -> 3083.61s]  and we were just going down the elevator and the mom was like not paying attention
[3084.25s -> 3091.13s]  and the little girl went like this walking with her finger pointing right towards just going for
[3091.13s -> 3098.49s]  a button and she was going she was going for like the emergency bell button and it was just in slow
[3098.49s -> 3107.96s]  motion i was just like oh no and it was she pressed it and it went like and for one second
[3109.34s -> 3114.63s]  and it was just like oh yeah and then we got off the elevator and like nothing happened
[3116.22s -> 3127.35s]  it was like what the fuck what's going on that's a fake story that's not a fake story
[3129.56s -> 3134.76s]  i didn't just make that up why would i make that up why would i make up a stupid elevator story
[3134.76s -> 3139.72s]  where a little kid presses like the bell button for like the ring the emergency button why would
[3139.72s -> 3163.18s]  i make that up there's no reason what do i gain from making that up what's that huh wait it was
[3163.18s -> 3193.42s]  a funny stream moment all right get me out what the fuck is going on go up what's what are you
[3193.42s -> 3236.36s]  doing i can't sing on the elevator are you pretending so i probably just have to sit here
[3236.36s -> 3261.34s]  for a minute all right i did it
[3274.09s -> 3295.08s]  blow some bubbles uh they're not here you you fail to comprehend the joke what wasting
[3295.08s -> 3301.13s]  someone's time is a joke wasting my valuable time is funny that's funny wasting my time
[3301.69s -> 3313.26s]  i just wasted my time that was a waste of my time and that's funny this new generation does not
[3313.26s -> 3321.69s]  fucking whatever stepping into his manager's office stanley i know the code already stunned
[3321.69s -> 3330.01s]  to discover not an indication of any human life what could it mean stanley wandered aloud to nobody
[3330.01s -> 3334.81s]  he began wildly stanley was in such a rush to get through the story as quickly as possible
[3334.81s -> 3341.13s]  he didn't even have a single minute to just let the narrator talk that kind of anxiety isn't
[3341.13s -> 3349.67s]  healthy he relaxed for a few moments with some calming new age music hey no but i don't you know
[3349.67s -> 3359.34s]  what i don't like when someone deliberately wastes my fucking time again right honey right feeling
[3359.34s -> 3369.90s]  soothed and rejuvenated stanley calmly walked forward into the opened passageway oh oh here
[3369.90s -> 3379.99s]  comes the streamer ego okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna press the other button you wasted all of our time
[3379.99s -> 3390.47s]  when you played this strawberry game oh that's different though that was funny that's different
[3390.47s -> 3404.28s]  that was funny that's a lot different oh yeah you wasted my time by having to make me put a
[3404.28s -> 3409.96s]  poll up every 15 seconds to get 85 percent of you to keep confirming to keep playing the game
[3409.96s -> 3418.14s]  that was wasting my time we're even stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read
[3418.14s -> 3426.02s]  mind control facility all right do i press the on button or do i go this let's go this way although
[3426.02s -> 3432.10s]  this passageway had the word escape written on it the truth was that at the end of this hall stanley
[3432.10s -> 3441.58s]  would meet his violent death your mods were doing it it wasn't even to you the door behind him was
[3441.58s -> 3447.74s]  not shut yeah and had every opportunity to turn around and get back on and like going to my other
[3447.74s -> 3458.22s]  monitor and typing each letter to say run another oh my god my fucking hands hurt after that my
[3458.22s -> 3466.33s]  fingers are so delicate i'm wasting my time at this point stanley was making a conscious concerted
[3466.33s -> 3476.26s]  effort to walk forward and willingly confront his death delicate do i actually just die if i go in
[3476.26s -> 3497.34s]  here there's sprint everyone's calling me a coward hey jeremy jump in this hole it'll grind you up
[3497.34s -> 3513.99s]  into a thousand pieces no coward you're a fucking coward okay do a gigachad oh well now that i'm
[3513.99s -> 3530.26s]  gonna be a gigachad of course i will jesus i thought i was supposed to die as the machine
[3530.26s -> 3535.70s]  word into motion and stanley was inched closer and closer oh shit it's gonna squish me he reflected
[3535.70s -> 3540.90s]  that his life had been of no consequence whatsoever stanley can't see the bigger picture
[3541.22s -> 3545.54s]  he doesn't know the whole story trapped forever i took a man to a grave
[3566.79s -> 3573.43s]  good farewell stanley cried the narrator as stanley was led helplessly into the
[3573.43s -> 3578.79s]  enormous metal jaws in a single visceral instant right a little toaster that's right
[3578.79s -> 3587.37s]  reiterated as the machine crushed every bone in his body killing him instantly no it didn't
[3588.01s -> 3606.30s]  it's too dark i can't see a movie and yet it would be just a few minutes before stanley would
[3606.30s -> 3612.30s]  restart the game back in his office as alive as ever why is there a narrator did the narrator
[3612.30s -> 3633.21s]  think he was going to accomplish dude this only happens with the pirated version when every pass
[3633.21s -> 3639.45s]  you can walk has been created for you long in advance death becomes meaningless making life
[3639.45s -> 3646.57s]  the same do you see now do you see that stanley was already dead from the moment he hit start
[3646.57s -> 3655.18s]  really office layout this blueprint shows the office from the beginning of the game path from
[3655.18s -> 3659.34s]  stanley's office to the two doors was the first part of the game that was built sections have
[3659.34s -> 3663.50s]  been added and altered throughout development the core layout remains almost identical to the first
[3663.50s -> 3683.90s]  iteration what the what the is insane that's the one the pacing of this opening section was
[3683.90s -> 3689.06s]  important to get right this corridor has been moved and altered to make sure the player reaches
[3689.06s -> 3710.01s]  the two doors in good time interesting filing cabinets cool office computers oh employee database
[3710.01s -> 3724.36s]  huh paintings look at this tuber nature paintings wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
[3729.78s -> 3736.90s]  the credits of the game what are these buttons oh auto how many buttons are there well it is one
[3736.90s -> 3753.80s]  two three four and this four bunch five oh it was here cookie behind you nice job nice job nice job
[3753.80s -> 3759.11s]  to all of you nice job actually great work like for real this is game school all right so where
[3759.11s -> 3778.25s]  do i go this way i'm gonna go over here maintenance room i've played so much elden ring that in my
[3778.25s -> 3786.15s]  brain there's an item right there there's a little glowy thing right there behind that you did it you
[3786.15s -> 3793.59s]  solved it not really early in development we designed an ending where stanley would end up
[3793.59s -> 3798.97s]  on a battlefield fighting aliens the action game would become sentient and would wage war against
[3798.97s -> 3805.62s]  the narrator we realized shortly after starting to build it that it was far too jokey and on the
[3805.62s -> 3810.28s]  nose for the tone of the game plus some people interpreted it as making fun of people who like
[3810.28s -> 3820.25s]  shooters which was not our intention that would have been that would have been kind of crazy
[3820.25s -> 3825.21s]  ultra deluxe announcements in december 2018 we announced the ultra deluxe version of the stanley
[3825.21s -> 3829.50s]  parable at the game awards these are screenshots of the videos we made for the announcement in the
[3829.50s -> 3852.63s]  game's delay cool the office the lounge the cargo lift why am i expecting a bunch of little chat
[3852.71s -> 3858.34s]  bubbles around here that i can click on and all of a sudden it's just like and that's why we decided
[3858.34s -> 3863.22s]  when we delayed it by a year or two that when we finally got it on steam we were gonna make sure
[3863.22s -> 3869.54s]  that me gaben would personally announce the games listing on steam like i feel like i'm looking for
[3869.54s -> 3904.01s]  those or this is gonna explode i don't want to see that that's spoilers maybe just a peek
[3904.01s -> 3918.47s]  maintenance layout there's a lot of stuff here what is going on why did that make my eye itch
[3918.47s -> 3923.86s]  zending levers are the zending the player would pull a lever in the narrator would describe what
[3923.86s -> 3931.18s]  color they pulled these are all spoilers out of the zending layer the zending model what's
[3931.18s -> 3941.02s]  his ending what does zending mean i don't want to see that countdown desk no this is i don't want
[3941.02s -> 3946.30s]  to see this freedom ending yeah i saw that okay i know that one yeah all right let me get out of
[3946.30s -> 3957.75s]  here i don't want to see this you're wasting time you're wasting our time oh please all right let's
[3957.75s -> 3965.77s]  do it stop stalling oh look at these two how they wish to destroy one another how they wish
[3965.77s -> 3983.93s]  to control one another how they both wish to be free like i'm gonna do this and the room that's
[3983.93s -> 3989.11s]  black is gonna lighten up and i'm like zapping somebody in the electric chair it's like look
[3989.11s -> 4001.21s]  at what you did can you see can you see how much they need one another no perhaps not sometimes
[4001.21s -> 4010.42s]  these things cannot be seen but listen to me you can still save those two you can stop the program
[4010.42s -> 4017.54s]  before they both fail push escape and press quit there's no other way to beat this game as long as
[4017.54s -> 4023.70s]  you move forward you'll be walking someone else's path stop now and it'll be your only true choice
[4023.70s -> 4051.26s]  whatever you do choose it don't let time choose for you don't let got it begin the game again
[4051.26s -> 4055.18s]  stanley knew the office layout like the back of his hand pretty much it was only a matter of
[4055.18s -> 4060.62s]  time before he found the others wherever they were just a matter of time he was supposed to quit
[4061.82s -> 4067.42s]  what i thought i was supposed to quit the game i missed the ending i was supposed to quit when
[4067.42s -> 4077.59s]  stanley came to a set of two open doors he entered the door on his left let's defy this was not the
[4077.59s -> 4082.79s]  correct way to the meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop by the
[4082.79s -> 4094.95s]  employee lounge first just to admire it it's truly a room worth admiring it had really been
[4094.95s -> 4099.91s]  worth the detour after all just to spend a few moments here in this immaculate beautifully
[4099.91s -> 4108.94s]  constructed room he's free stanley simply stood here drinking it all in like are these free why
[4112.73s -> 4120.65s]  yes really really worth it being here in the room a room so utterly captivating that even though
[4120.73s -> 4125.85s]  all your co-workers have mysteriously vanished here you sit looking at these chairs and some
[4125.85s -> 4131.05s]  paintings really worth it i mean i'm just checking it out man stop trying to rush me
[4134.58s -> 4138.34s]  at this point stanley's obsession with this room bordered on creepy
[4138.34s -> 4143.54s]  and reflected poorly on his overall personality i'm just trying it's possible that this is why
[4143.54s -> 4153.85s]  everyone left you're wasting time you're wasting the narrator's time stanley sat around waiting
[4153.85s -> 4159.29s]  for more dialogue but when a long time had passed and there was no more he decided that the game
[4159.29s -> 4186.34s]  was trying to send him a message but at last he'd had enough of the amazing room and took the first
[4186.34s -> 4195.70s]  open door on his left to get back to business nope i'm not going in there i'm gonna look in there and
[4195.70s -> 4207.77s]  see what's in there but i'm not going in stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible
[4207.77s -> 4225.86s]  he wasn't five years ago what's this omega low warning do not jump from the cargo lift while
[4225.86s -> 4243.70s]  it is in motion will cause death penalties can i go in here i need a credit card look stanley i
[4243.70s -> 4248.50s]  think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here but in his eagerness to prove that he is in
[4248.50s -> 4253.78s]  control of the story and no one gets to tell him what to do stanley leapt from the platform
[4253.78s -> 4266.94s]  and plunged to his death good job stanley everyone thinks you are very powerful all of his co-workers
[4266.94s -> 4272.70s]  were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed
[4272.70s -> 4282.06s]  a memo and it's the same what happens when stanley could be lying to a set of two open doors this was
[4282.06s -> 4287.26s]  not the correct way to the meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop
[4287.26s -> 4297.24s]  by the employee lounge first just to admire it wow yes this room but eager to get back to business
[4297.32s -> 4302.84s]  stanley took the first open door on his left best burp of the year what a dumb category
[4304.65s -> 4308.57s]  okay so here we go stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible he
[4308.57s -> 4314.89s]  wasn't fired years ago so go on the thing don't follow up look stanley i think perhaps we've
[4314.89s -> 4319.21s]  gotten off what if i do it again what if i do it again i'm not your enemy really i'm not
[4320.01s -> 4325.45s]  but in his eagerness to prove that he is in control of the story what if something changed
[4325.45s -> 4331.21s]  stanley left from the platform and plunged to his death good job all right i just didn't i didn't
[4331.21s -> 4337.82s]  know i sometimes there's something different i don't know it could have been like stanley realized
[4337.82s -> 4344.14s]  that he thought to himself am i sure that the orders stopped coming in how is that possible
[4344.14s -> 4351.03s]  they never stopped surely i was mistaken no no the orders were still missing for now
[4356.50s -> 4360.42s]  yeah i don't know i it could have been like oh stanley realized that the ai had not loaded in
[4360.42s -> 4371.21s]  the fall damage yet i don't know who knows this is a game this is a weird game you never know when
[4371.21s -> 4376.65s]  stanley came to a set of two open doors this was not the correct way to the meeting room and stanley
[4376.65s -> 4381.21s]  knew it perfectly maybe three times perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first
[4381.21s -> 4387.45s]  just to admire it no i'll have to do it a third time the lounge was sublime a work of art but
[4387.45s -> 4396.12s]  eager to get back to business stanley took the first open door on his left oh i'm gonna go across
[4396.12s -> 4401.08s]  stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible he wasn't fired years ago
[4401.08s -> 4407.88s]  okay let's go look stanley i think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here i'm not your
[4407.88s -> 4412.76s]  enemy really i'm not everyone realize that investing every single person is my enemy
[4413.40s -> 4419.82s]  but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you my enemy this time there's someone
[4419.82s -> 4426.38s]  you've been neglecting stanley someone you've forgotten really i was in the middle of something
[4426.38s -> 4431.58s]  do you have zero consideration for others are you that convinced that i want something bad to
[4431.58s -> 4437.50s]  happen to you why i don't know how to convince you of this but i really do want to help you
[4437.50s -> 4444.22s]  to show you something beautiful look let me prove it let me prove that i'm on your side give me a
[4444.22s -> 4476.76s]  chance all right do it do it then stop talking about it and do it danger everywhere now listen
[4476.76s -> 4492.14s]  carefully this is important okay stanley walked through the red door what if he kills me he said
[4492.14s -> 4503.54s]  he wants to prove it prove it oh thank god you are willing to listen to me prove it now you see that
[4503.54s -> 4508.10s]  i really have wanted you to be happy all this time but you haven't proved it the problem is all these
[4508.10s -> 4512.90s]  choices the two of us always trying to get somewhere that isn't here running and running

[5121.78s -> 5126.50s]  from this platform over and over to be rid of it you were literally willing to kill yourself
[5126.50s -> 5138.26s]  to keep me from being happy no i didn't reading the situation correctly no i just no it doesn't

[5301.94s -> 5319.18s]  okay so i don't go that way i'm gonna go in the blue door this time blue door and he came to a
[5320.06s -> 5325.08s]  telephone whatever to the door and answer the phone whatever this was not the correct way to
[5325.08s -> 5330.12s]  the meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee
[5330.12s -> 5337.16s]  i need to go in the blue door just to admire it standing now in this incredible room stanley for
[5337.16s -> 5342.28s]  the first but eager to get back to business stanley took the first open door on his left
[5343.08s -> 5350.52s]  no i didn't stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible he wasn't fired years
[5350.84s -> 5357.38s]  all right blue door look stanley i think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here
[5357.38s -> 5362.82s]  i'm not your enemy really i'm not i realize that investing your trust in someone else can be
[5362.82s -> 5369.94s]  difficult but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you all this time there's someone
[5369.94s -> 5377.22s]  you've been neglecting stanley someone you've forgotten about please stop trying what really
[5377.70s -> 5381.62s]  oh wait what do you have zero consideration for others
[5383.54s -> 5388.26s]  something bad to happen to you give me the blue door i don't know how to convince you of this but
[5388.26s -> 5394.98s]  i really do want to help you to show you something beautiful look let me prove it let me prove that
[5394.98s -> 5401.86s]  i'm on your side give me a chance blue now listen carefully this is important stanley walked through
[5401.86s -> 5412.90s]  the red door perhaps you misunderstood stanley walked through the red door i still don't think
[5412.90s -> 5421.61s]  we're communicating properly stanley walked through the red door all right fine go ahead stanley you
[5421.61s -> 5426.25s]  want to know so badly what's out there you want to find out what lies at the end of this road
[5426.25s -> 5435.93s]  you've chosen world don't let me stop you you see there's nothing here i haven't even finished
[5435.93s -> 5440.17s]  building this section of the map because you were never supposed to be here in the first place
[5440.17s -> 5445.77s]  broken rooms exposed developer textures is this what you had wanted was it worth ruining the
[5445.77s -> 5451.61s]  entire story is a jump map specifically for you do you not think i put a lot of time into that
[5451.61s -> 5456.97s]  because i did and in the end it was all for nothing because this is what you wanted to see
[5456.97s -> 5462.41s]  help me here stanley help elucidate these strange and unknowable desires of yours what would have
[5462.41s -> 5468.65s]  made this game better what did you want to see ours yep a car skilled trees work with me you
[5468.65s -> 5474.87s]  give me absolutely nothing so far tell you what let me take a stab in the dark at a new design
[5474.87s -> 5481.67s]  and you can give me some feedback there we go a third option already feels leaps ahead of where
[5481.67s -> 5487.19s]  we were before go ahead stanley take it for a spin but should i go in there or should i go one of the
[5487.19s -> 5501.03s]  other doors i'll try it please rate your experience okay i'm going to stop you there
[5501.03s -> 5506.23s]  now tell me about your experience with this new version would you say that the game benefited
[5506.23s -> 5512.31s]  from allowing you more choices feel free to be honest i'm looking for some real critical feedback
[5512.31s -> 5522.82s]  here a one i mean i can understand if you had reservations you saw ways the game could be
[5522.82s -> 5528.90s]  improved to more fully express itself mechanically and artistically but a one that's not even helpful
[5528.90s -> 5536.41s]  what am i supposed to do with that uh but i guess it isn't my place to judge here based on the data
[5536.41s -> 5541.69s]  from your previous playthrough i've compiled a new version and to be perfectly candid i think
[5541.69s -> 5550.18s]  i've knocked it out of the park with this one let's take a look stanley powerful worldwide
[5550.18s -> 5565.96s]  leaderboard worldwide leaderboard 21 percent of players skipped the intro sequence only the worst
[5565.96s -> 5572.66s]  30 percent of players chose the blue door 98 percent of players uh how long does it take you
[5572.66s -> 5579.94s]  to get to the correct door compete against others to improve your stanley parable career
[5579.94s -> 5588.44s]  that's funny now you see a lot of one star reviews would you say that competitive leaderboard
[5588.44s -> 5592.76s]  when you read the review motivated to keep walking it's like they forgot a ketchup packet
[5592.76s -> 5602.22s]  honest answers please i mean the server was actually really nice the food was fine
[5603.02s -> 5610.07s]  i mean they forgot um forgot to put a sauce in the bag oh fuck this place hey i nearly forgot
[5610.07s -> 5614.63s]  i've got a prototype of a new game i've been working on and now would be a lovely opportunity
[5614.63s -> 5619.11s]  to give it some play testing you wouldn't mind taking a look at it would you sure perfect let
[5619.11s -> 5627.14s]  me boot it up in this game the baby crawls left towards danger oh no you'll click the button to
[5627.14s -> 5633.46s]  move him back to the right and if he reaches the fire you fail it's a very meaningful game all
[5633.46s -> 5639.14s]  about the desperation and tedium of endlessly confronting the demands of family life i think
[5639.14s -> 5645.38s]  the art world will really take notice but of course the message of the game only becomes clear
[5645.38s -> 5650.18s]  once you've been playing it for about four hours okay why don't you give it four hours of play
[5650.18s -> 5664.49s]  to make sure it's effective so rescue baby notes on your experience so loud it's too loud
[5670.02s -> 5679.00s]  how long do i i don't i don't i don't like this i don't like it i don't a baby sounds
[5680.18s -> 5688.25s]  you can do this but i'm not doing it i don't care you heartless bastard did you do it because
[5688.25s -> 5693.21s]  you hate babies or purely to spite me because if it's the latter well i don't know what to do
[5693.21s -> 5698.17s]  i'm completely out of ideas i can't think of a single thing that might improve the experience
[5698.17s -> 5705.13s]  for me i'm not even going to try i'm out i'm out i'm done no it's over what thank you for playing
[5705.45s -> 5710.33s]  your input was extremely valuable refund hey since my game was so awful why don't we play
[5710.33s -> 5715.45s]  someone else's game just to ease the pain let's see what do we have here
[5719.77s -> 5731.53s]  yes this seems like it'll work let's give it a shot what fascinating what do you think this
[5731.53s -> 5738.68s]  game is about stanley what's our backstory this fire watch this vision well it seems obvious to
[5738.68s -> 5743.96s]  me that you are meant to play as a creepy man spying on innocent civilians below you from up
[5743.96s -> 5751.40s]  high in your creep tower perhaps for some sort of twisted erotic purpose hmm yes that must be it
[5751.40s -> 5757.48s]  what a fascinating venture into the experience of total mental depravity so far i love everything
[5757.48s -> 5763.08s]  about this game stanley and it seems there's even more come let's venture outward and see what else
[5763.96s -> 5793.58s]  okay i think you're gonna see your asshole i love the okay somebody just said what with like
[5794.14s -> 5801.82s]  three question marks this is you need a little bit of context go to youtube.com slash germa985
[5802.38s -> 5811.34s]  an old channel and go look for a video called the photos are in you might like unfollow the
[5811.34s -> 5817.38s]  channel after watching that video right should i tell people to go watch that i mean it's like
[5817.38s -> 5831.80s]  my favorite video but i mean like should i be telling people to do that so this is it's an
[5831.80s -> 5840.25s]  open world game good god quickly block it off hey oh dear goodness stanley what a close call
[5840.89s -> 5847.61s]  you nearly wandered off into that that thing that big open just wandering around no right or wrong
[5847.61s -> 5856.17s]  directions no path to follow you can just go in any oh thank heavens we avoided it we're out of
[5856.17s -> 5862.01s]  the woods now stanley okay i'm going to get us out of here let's find another another game all
[5862.01s -> 5867.93s]  right this is something with walls something with nice big insurmountable walls what do you got
[5871.69s -> 5883.58s]  okay i think this will be just the thing rocket league see this is exactly what i had in mind
[5883.58s -> 5888.54s]  just a nice big box for you to run around in there isn't any possibility that you could get
[5888.54s -> 5895.10s]  lost here now this is game design stanley if you manage to get lost in this game i will be
[5895.10s -> 5904.23s]  phenomenally impressed but where are the cars okay so what exactly do we do here let's see
[5905.03s -> 5908.63s]  there are lots of cars here in the back but obviously there's no racetrack
[5908.63s -> 5914.87s]  okay i'm seeing that there's a ball of some kind back here is this game sports ball stanley i think
[5914.87s -> 5921.83s]  it's sports ball oh what fun what fun run the bases and do a touchdown together yes i think
[5921.83s -> 5934.22s]  surely we must okay stanley here's the ball have fun will this kill me if i go near it by the way
[5934.22s -> 5937.90s]  i picked the blue door i'm shooting into the blue goal and he's probably gonna be like pissed
[5941.43s -> 5947.50s]  are you doing it winning is this fun is it better than my miserable little story that i work so hard
[5947.50s -> 5952.62s]  on stanley i have a thought actually never got into rocket league i'm not a sportsologist but if
[5952.62s -> 5958.70s]  one ball generates a certain amount of raw adrenal pleasure then surely multiple balls
[5959.98s -> 5969.37s]  what are you doing stanley don't do that i can't follow you there i can't help you
[5970.01s -> 5973.21s]  how will you write a story without me you can't do it you know that
[5976.28s -> 5984.95s]  shit okay so now what filing cabinet what did i say like that it's too dark i can't see anything
[5984.95s -> 6001.85s]  please rate your experience oh my goodness this is a horror game now or something this is a
[6001.85s -> 6032.94s]  horror game isn't it this is he turned it into a horror game is that what happened what's that
[6032.94s -> 6085.13s]  four two seven what the fuck i can't do anything i wonder what he found if what he wanted was to be
[6085.13s -> 6091.29s]  the leading man in his own story well perhaps he's gotten it down in wherever he is right now
[6091.29s -> 6096.33s]  i wonder if he's happy with his choice and if he's learned the heavy cost that comes with it
[6096.97s -> 6102.81s]  he'll understand soon what i was trying to tell him he needs me someone who will wrap everything
[6102.81s -> 6108.81s]  up at the end to make sense out of the chaos and the fear and the confusion that's who i am
[6108.81s -> 6116.09s]  that is what i mean to this world oh yes yes i'll be back there's no other way once this ends after
[6116.09s -> 6126.15s]  it all comes to a close then i'll be back the end will be here soon very soon i can wait used car
[6126.15s -> 6142.97s]  salesman here okay let's go how long was i sitting there stanley wandered to himself minutes days
[6143.53s -> 6149.53s]  centuries did something crucial happen while my senses were turned he made a note to be more
[6149.53s -> 6154.89s]  careful with time from now on all right so where do i should i turn on the mind control machine
[6156.34s -> 6187.83s]  new content oh new content what does that mean new content new content can i turn the brightness

[6247.98s -> 6255.51s]  it was a fake tuber reaction okay so far it's an elevator nothing special yet but i'm sure it's
[6255.51s -> 6267.74s]  just the beginning of a mesmerizing adventure okay um is it broken what's going on here should we
[6268.70s -> 6275.34s]  should we be moving somewhere or oh there we go all right finally at long last it's onto the new
[6275.42s -> 6278.38s]  content i've never been more ready let's do it
[6285.78s -> 6292.82s]  i have to say initial impressions of stanley parable ultra deluxe mostly tedious it's as if them
[6293.46s -> 6304.07s]  oh okay let's see the content give me the content stanley content all right all right let's see it's
[6304.95s -> 6330.34s]  the jump circle jumps remaining oh there's a jump now okay well 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
[6330.34s -> 6337.85s]  i'm not gonna fucking do what you tell me to do is is that it surely that's not all the new content
[6337.85s -> 6345.61s]  there has to be something else right goodness another elevator stanley i have to say initial
[6345.61s -> 6351.85s]  impressions of this game are not positive it's just elevators and jumping is this what passes
[6351.85s -> 6357.05s]  for exciting new content if this is new content then i could just read you the whole dictionary
[6357.05s -> 6362.17s]  there's 20 hours of new content right there there's more than that counter 30 trillion you could
[6362.17s -> 6368.25s]  put that on the box the stanley parable ultra deluxe now with over a thousand hours of new
[6368.25s -> 6374.81s]  content and it's way more than it's more there's way more than that yes i knew there had to be
[6374.81s -> 6379.61s]  something else is there a melee now i'm ready for whatever it is all right where's the jump
[6380.25s -> 6390.87s]  i don't have a jump that's it oh you've got to be kidding me you see stanley this is what happens
[6390.87s -> 6397.03s]  when greedy video game developers with no respect for their fan base rush a cheap expansion to market
[6397.03s -> 6401.67s]  for no reason other than to make an easy that's pretty good don't get me started on the level of
[6401.67s -> 6405.75s]  craftsmanship that's gone into it that was good i'm looking right now at the game's achievements
[6405.75s -> 6411.59s]  and it's hard to believe one of them actually says test achievement please ignore what quality
[6411.59s -> 6416.87s]  assurance department signed off on this i'm infuriated and i'm offended and i i intend to
[6416.87s -> 6422.71s]  find these people on twitter and hold them personally accountable it's my fault stanley
[6422.71s -> 6427.51s]  i built up too much anticipation around the new content i'm afraid it could never have lived up
[6427.51s -> 6433.59s]  to such expectations that's true you're still with me why don't we just reset the game and we'll try
[6433.59s -> 6441.27s]  to get back to what the stanley parable is really about no frills no gimmicks just you and me having
[6441.27s -> 6453.18s]  a great time together wait so that's it do i have to do something else what do you say friend wait
[6453.82s -> 6465.19s]  this is different wait what happened this is different it's different door four eight door
[6465.19s -> 6475.94s]  four thirty stanley come over here in the vent i want to show you something oh not yet
[6479.61s -> 6486.84s]  keys no this cigarette butts holy shit oh you don't want to see the cool surprise i made for you well
[6487.48s -> 6509.21s]  you're a dork anyways you're a dork okay new content it's closed when stanley came to a set
[6509.21s -> 6527.38s]  of two open doors he entered the door on his left yet there was not a single person here either
[6527.38s -> 6533.22s]  okay feeling a wave of disbelief stanley decided to go up to his boss's office no i'm going down
[6533.22s -> 6541.74s]  here staircase stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office but stanley just couldn't do it
[6541.82s -> 6546.94s]  he considered the possibility of facing his boss oh wait i'm gonna dream left his post during work
[6546.94s -> 6555.29s]  hours he might be fired for that and in such a competitive economy okay begin the game okay
[6559.54s -> 6566.10s]  okay stanley come over here all right in the vent i want to show you something
[6575.35s -> 6580.63s]  okay you remember how cheap and unsatisfying the new ultra deluxe content turned out to be
[6581.19s -> 6585.19s]  thinking about the past and how much better the stanley parable used to be
[6585.99s -> 6590.95s]  i made something special and tucked it away here where the game's developers won't find it
[6591.59s -> 6597.27s]  just our little secret what is this is this the warcraft portal what's that thing called
[6598.07s -> 6610.58s]  it was a warcraft portal i've ruined it whatever i call it the memory zone it's where i've been
[6610.66s -> 6616.26s]  storing all my favorite memories so i can relive the peak experiences of my life
[6616.26s -> 6621.86s]  whenever i want a memory zone like the launch of the stanley parable on pc
[6623.94s -> 6630.82s]  the memory zone okay so what can i do in here did i really not answer the telephone i whatever
[6633.32s -> 6638.28s]  don't forget you see stanley doesn't the memory zone remind you of how wonderful stanley parable
[6638.28s -> 6645.08s]  was before it was solid with a cheap re-release remember back award-winning 2013 when the game
[6645.08s -> 6652.44s]  originally launched back then video games had integrity back then it all meant something oh
[6652.44s -> 6669.94s]  the waste 2013 2013 our first kiss my first car the release of stanley parable is 2013 was a pretty
[6669.94s -> 6690.87s]  dogshit year for video games wasn't it what even came out in 2013 gta 5 did that's it what else
[6690.87s -> 6705.22s]  came out in 2013 assassin's creed mario kart 8 stanley parable the last of us metal gear rising
[6705.22s -> 6722.25s]  metal gear rising bioshock infinite british academy award british academy award british
[6722.25s -> 6737.62s]  cat a lot of academy awards risk of rain old 2013 germa will never get the magic back
[6737.62s -> 6744.34s]  no we'll never get the magic i'll never get the magic of never mind
[6756.87s -> 6761.59s]  and over here is where i keep reviews of the stanley parable like this stunning
[6761.59s -> 6767.75s]  triumph of games journalism 10 out of 10 from destructoid.com didn't really get a 10
[6767.75s -> 6772.71s]  sterling rights did it actually get a 10 and a 10 we're so many games that aspire to be more
[6772.71s -> 6778.71s]  than games end up less than any form of art stanley parable it got a 10 out of 10 succeeds
[6778.71s -> 6785.99s]  to be every game ever created did you hear that stanley every game ever created that's how grand
[6785.99s -> 6794.31s]  and all-encompassing the original stanley mod db 2012 every game ever passed it was skyrim it
[6794.31s -> 6801.51s]  was persona 3 it was all of them and now it's nothing it's no games at all it isn't even the
[6801.51s -> 6808.63s]  stanley parable anymore it's just a husk now narrative excellent husk with an hour of
[6808.63s -> 6822.81s]  wait a minute elevator content persona three i didn't play i haven't played any of the personas
[6822.81s -> 6837.56s]  nostalgic it was good well i feel like in like 10 years i'm gonna be gripping one of the two of
[6837.56s -> 6845.16s]  those not 10 years holy shit dude whoa i was talking about being like buried like in a coffin
[6845.24s -> 6849.40s]  with those and like i'm thinking back to like i remember when i won those i said oh in 10 years
[6849.40s -> 6858.82s]  no i can i can this be a lot longer like 60 70 more years i'm gonna be gripping those things and
[6858.82s -> 6881.98s]  i'm like fucking 90 in the coffin just like the end is never the end here's another moving passage
[6881.98s -> 6889.90s]  this time from gamespot.com what is both a richly stimulating commentary on the nature of choice in
[6889.90s -> 6895.02s]  games and one that offers some of the most enjoyable surprising and rewarding choices
[6895.02s -> 6899.90s]  i've ever been confronted with in a game nine out of ten don't you get it stanley
[6899.90s -> 6907.10s]  the game was perfect it didn't need anything else it didn't need new content it just needed to be
[6907.10s -> 6913.90s]  left alone to spend the rest of time collecting dust in the hallowed hall of beloved video game
[6913.90s -> 6931.32s]  memories look how sad the serious room okay i can't go in the serious room how do i i can't
[6931.32s -> 6945.64s]  where's my jump i can't where's my i don't have a jump oh these were simpler times stanley
[6946.44s -> 6957.03s]  but i wouldn't give to go back to have it all over again and we're there stanley pick the door on the
[6957.03s -> 6970.95s]  right right that would be crazy basement wait hang on i don't recall this part of the memory
[6970.95s -> 6989.19s]  zone before what's this what's down here mario 64 andy it's a joke oh no no stanley it's a collection
[6989.19s -> 6995.35s]  of reviews from steam the online video game distributor i haven't looked at these in years
[6995.35s -> 7000.23s]  i can't even imagine what's been collecting down here steam reviews these reviews were glowing as
[7000.23s -> 7010.81s]  well weren't they oh god oh honestly i could not be bothered to play this game to full completion
[7010.81s -> 7016.73s]  the narrator is obnoxious and unfunny with his humor and dialogue proving to be more
[7016.73s -> 7023.45s]  irritating than entertaining unfunny i'm not trying to be funny i'm trying to make a serious
[7023.45s -> 7028.65s]  work of art i suppose i could write up a handful of gags to insert into the stanley parable but
[7028.65s -> 7034.33s]  the game is already such a densely layered web of profound philosophical insights that i can't even
[7034.33s -> 7059.05s]  imagine where i'd have the room to stick them unfunny okay does this do anything nope i climb
[7059.05s -> 7075.51s]  this nope remember there's a spider on your shelf he's probably eating the bad bugs can you guys
[7075.51s -> 7081.08s]  imagine if there's just one day yeah all of a sudden all of a sudden there was just a huge
[7081.08s -> 7085.80s]  tarantula just like here like and climbing over here and shit and i was like what are you talking
[7085.80s -> 7095.61s]  about guys fucking stop make shut up like a fucking 90s comedy movie says while the idea
[7095.61s -> 7101.69s]  for the game is good for someone who prefers non-linear games this preachiness gets annoying
[7101.69s -> 7108.41s]  fast preachy stanley i'm not preachy am i you can tell me if i'm preachy honestly you can
[7108.41s -> 7114.09s]  oh goodness this is actually quite shocking for me right i always worked to be honest i had always
[7114.09s -> 7119.61s]  thought of the game's dialogue as being rather terse to begin with you can't know how much fluff
[7119.61s -> 7125.05s]  i cut from the game to get it to feel as light and airy as it well i always thought it did but
[7125.05s -> 7129.69s]  maybe it wasn't three hours on record that's a lot you pretty much saw everything memory to have to
[7129.69s -> 7137.77s]  hold on to these black marks are my otherwise unimpeachable track record i feel like a failure
[7138.49s -> 7144.33s]  like i let these people down perhaps the stanley parable isn't quite as sterling as i always
[7144.33s -> 7152.28s]  remembered it's like the one person that's like hey dude dollhouse sucked it wasn't funny i'm just
[7152.28s -> 7176.74s]  like fuck and i'm like guys i gotta take a few i gotta take a week off streaming what's this one
[7176.74s -> 7183.38s]  got to say you constantly have to stop doing anything so the narrator can catch up with his
[7183.38s -> 7191.00s]  again explanations of what's happening i wish there was a skip button a skip button
[7191.00s -> 7196.76s]  let's stick up 10 hours well yes yes i think we can do that if i'm truly too preachy then
[7196.76s -> 7200.28s]  then maybe letting how do you play the original stanley parable for 10 hours
[7201.16s -> 7207.24s]  and i don't understand that negative reviews from the record only positive reviews of the stanley
[7207.24s -> 7213.24s]  parable that's my motto today and it's always been my motto i do anything for the customer stanley
[7213.24s -> 7223.83s]  yes a skip button we shall have these minds are resonant evil four like this this exact
[7224.94s -> 7229.58s]  thing i'm looking at right now this exact screenshot exact is resonant evil four right
[7229.58s -> 7239.21s]  here right there and here it is go ahead and give it a shot i'll get you forward in time
[7239.21s -> 7247.42s]  so that the second my incessant droning starts to how long has it been your back you see you
[7247.42s -> 7251.90s]  were only frozen in time for a few minutes but it was plenty of time for me to deliver
[7251.90s -> 7259.58s]  a long rambling monologue full of um well there's sport you really did catch me rambling on a bit
[7259.58s -> 7264.30s]  didn't you but that's the power of the button the minute i start to go off on a thoughtless
[7264.30s -> 7269.58s]  display of self-absorption it's right at your fingertips okay poof and it's all over oh i
[7269.58s -> 7274.14s]  can't wait to see what cooking nine will say about this and whether they'll edit the rating
[7274.14s -> 7279.18s]  of their steam review or at least change some of the wording perhaps to be honest i don't even
[7279.18s -> 7285.10s]  know if one can change their review can you edit a review i guess i should okay welcome back stanley
[7285.10s -> 7289.66s]  now i should say that the amount of time the button has been skipping through is becoming longer and
[7289.66s -> 7299.00s]  longer that last one was well i want to say maybe 30 45 minutes stanley stanley stanley please don't
[7299.00s -> 7305.96s]  push the button again it's been 12 hours you've just been frozen there why age skips are getting
[7305.96s -> 7311.40s]  longer but they're really truly getting longer and my god there's no way out of the room stanley
[7311.40s -> 7317.16s]  the door is gone it's completely gone i've looked at it from every angle i've checked every one of
[7317.16s -> 7324.84s]  those walls a thousand times yeah yeah stanley there's no door there's just you and the button
[7324.84s -> 7330.52s]  and if you keep pressing it i have no idea what will happen i have no idea how long i'll be made
[7330.52s -> 7335.24s]  to sit here and more than anything else i don't know how to stop you from pressing the button
[7335.96s -> 7340.20s]  great door i can't control anything in this room stanley i can't touch it sorry if the
[7340.20s -> 7345.24s]  muppets could do it you could too i have to know that sooner or later no matter how much i plead
[7345.24s -> 7350.68s]  with you you're going to press the button again why would you i've been thinking and thinking and i
[7350.68s -> 7355.54s]  i don't know what i can do to convince you otherwise oh my god and it's all because
[7355.54s -> 7360.58s]  of those reviews those reviews that i couldn't get out of my head i just couldn't ignore the
[7361.22s -> 7367.30s]  feedback why was it so important for me to fix the problem why did cookie nine's opinion matter
[7367.30s -> 7376.18s]  so much to me i've never even met oh stanley oh my goodness i have someone to talk to again
[7377.94s -> 7384.58s]  i think it's been a week or two weeks i've been sitting here all that time just sitting here
[7384.98s -> 7391.46s]  should have watered the plant and you'd think that that's just how it's always been right me
[7391.46s -> 7397.70s]  talking and you saying nothing would you think that it's exactly the same as always their door
[7397.70s -> 7403.78s]  doesn't that feel like what we've already been doing me just talking but it isn't stanley it
[7403.78s -> 7410.26s]  isn't the same at all it isn't even close because i know you can't hear me once you push that button
[7410.34s -> 7415.94s]  that's what i'm realizing now stanley i'm realizing that i needed to know that someone was
[7415.94s -> 7422.10s]  listening i needed there to be a vessel through which my words were moving it was the vessel i
[7422.10s -> 7430.26s]  needed stanley none of that matters anymore i'll give it all up i'll give up every branching path
[7430.26s -> 7436.50s]  i'll burn my story to the ground one single thing i need and god i can see now that i needed more
[7436.50s -> 7442.26s]  than anything is to know that someone else is taking it in these words that i'm saying i need
[7442.26s -> 7449.70s]  to know you can hear me because maybe stanley maybe if you can hear me then maybe it means i'm real
[7450.50s -> 7458.10s]  gotta keep me interested keep me interested play a sound effect or something perhaps yes perhaps
[7458.10s -> 7462.90s]  i've been scared this whole time that if i stop speaking i'll slip backwards into the silence and
[7462.90s -> 7469.08s]  be consumed by it i can't be taken by it stanley i can't lose myself in the stretch of emptiness
[7469.08s -> 7473.88s]  oh i'm gonna press it i'm gonna press it when you press that button you're still right there but i
[7473.88s -> 7480.28s]  know you're so tremendously far away and in those moments the emptiness folds itself outward in
[7480.28s -> 7484.92s]  between the two of us all right i'll give another minute i am suspended in its unyielding quiet
[7484.92s -> 7490.44s]  it's a i know it's like a podcast the edges of my reality curdling inward and decaying
[7491.24s -> 7498.28s]  i can tell that i am becoming less and less real yet to speak to you now i am alive
[7498.28s -> 7505.24s]  i am truly and completely here i am a being i am someone i am something i am being listened to
[7505.24s -> 7511.16s]  i am being recognized yes the emptiness between us has collapsed and i feel right now like i am not
[7511.16s -> 7523.69s]  a work of fiction i feel oh hello it's you you're here again welcome i have had time to think about
[7523.69s -> 7529.13s]  you and about us and about everything we've been through i've had so much how much time i
[7529.13s -> 7534.17s]  stopped keeping track after a year let's put a year sat down in one place and not move for one
[7534.17s -> 7541.13s]  entire year let me describe it for you to begin with there is only regret there is only the turning
[7541.13s -> 7547.29s]  wheel of missed opportunities i felt nothing at all but regret for the lost time stanley
[7547.29s -> 7553.61s]  door months i lost it all in a blur of the deepest longing to undo the past
[7554.17s -> 7577.18s]  and when that feeling had begun to subside where is he did he leave where did he go where is he
[7581.70s -> 7593.88s]  where is he how long has it been where is he what do you mean he's dead he's a computer
[7593.88s -> 7603.06s]  program he can't die what the fuck all right all right all right all right all right okay
[7603.06s -> 7607.22s]  okay all right all right turn it off turn it off turn it off turn it off turn it off
[7607.94s -> 7612.74s]  turn it off where is it turn it off i don't want to hear this turn it off but they didn't understand
[7612.74s -> 7617.30s]  the game was never meant to be funny it was meant to have a point it was meant to speak to the
[7617.30s -> 7622.34s]  human condition but where are the jokes where are the jokes they bemoan they screamed they gnashed
[7622.34s -> 7628.98s]  their teeth and said entertain us it right they had to leave a pathetic little thumbs down review
[7628.98s -> 7634.50s]  and make all of their pitiful demands but then he's talking too much they said yes he didn't
[7634.50s -> 7639.86s]  entertain us now he won't shut up it's the inconsistency it's the lack of accountability
[7639.86s -> 7644.66s]  unwillingness to examine with an uncompromising heart the words that they are speaking into the
[7644.66s -> 7649.78s]  world as though there were no consequences for a lack of cohesion in one's assessment of others
[7649.78s -> 7655.14s]  but of course absolutely anyone can leave a review so here's what we get we get these demands that
[7655.14s -> 7659.78s]  seek everything and are accountable to nothing i'm not skipping at all someone will say no skipping
[7659.78s -> 7664.66s]  there should be a skip button you should be able to freeze stanley in place while the narrator sits
[7664.66s -> 7670.50s]  there forever and ever we want all of this in the new stanley parable we demand it and then because
[7670.50s -> 7678.20s]  it was said because it was spoken now it simply has to happen the most immediate desires every
[7678.20s -> 7683.96s]  single thing demanded by every person at every moment in time if someone wants it then it's a
[7683.96s -> 7689.80s]  crime not to bring it into being have we been given to indulging every fleeting whim for no
[7689.80s -> 7696.52s]  reason other than to do so yes yes it seems that this is now the world we live in it seems that
[7696.52s -> 7702.28s]  we are play glover play glover discomfort with ourselves that our entertainment is farting you
[7702.28s -> 7706.84s]  chair hey hey make a sound funny stuff fart and make fart in the sound
[7718.44s -> 7747.42s]  i just want to hear that sound anymore gross minus 10 you've lost to the skip button every
[7747.42s -> 7757.35s]  time you press the skip button you lose a thousand viewers no that's not happening is it no is that
[7757.35s -> 7765.91s]  happening ah that's not is that happening the end is never the end is never the end is never
[7768.55s -> 7791.96s]  and is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end well isn't he crafting
[7791.96s -> 7800.86s]  the game why would he just craft a like i don't know like a tuner sandwich or something for me
[7800.86s -> 7809.18s]  to hang out and eat why am i like demanding a sandwich what am i talking about this is like
[7809.18s -> 7815.50s]  not cool how long has it been i've been here for like a thousand years or something what's going
[7815.50s -> 7851.46s]  on can i get out vegeta like life is growing in here now dude what would be awesome is if like
[7851.46s -> 7859.21s]  you heard boom boom boom and like a t rex's face looked in and we weren't going forward we were
[7859.21s -> 7889.53s]  going backwards what the fuck that idea is dumb as hell that's stupid fuck you fuck you all right
[7889.53s -> 7917.26s]  how do i get out of here it's uh it's scary now hey why is it so scary what the fuck oh i can get
[7917.26s -> 7979.53s]  out doesn't work the fuck how long was i sitting there stanley wandered to himself minutes days
[7980.09s -> 7986.09s]  centuries did something crucial happen while my senses were turned he made a note to be more
[7986.09s -> 7993.82s]  careful with time from now on be more careful with time write that down new new content not
[7993.82s -> 8000.70s]  old new content okay oh good you notice my sign yes i have something very exciting to show you
[8002.46s -> 8018.07s]  what about that door i could probably go this way too right eventually maybe i don't know
[8021.26s -> 8029.08s]  new you see stanley i've been reflecting on the stanley parable and about how roundly disappointing
[8029.08s -> 8034.84s]  this ultra deluxe version has turned out to be i think it's all right stanley parable was a landmark
[8034.84s -> 8039.64s]  and any new content for it should live up to that legacy i think it's so far get this ultra
[8039.64s -> 8047.88s]  deluxe nonsense i say we take it one step even further which is why i'm very proud to announce
[8047.88s -> 8099.86s]  for the first time ever the stanley parable too oh yes you see isn't this far superior to a me
[8099.86s -> 8104.82s]  stanley parable too with a few minor additions think of all the new territory will cover with
[8104.82s -> 8110.58s]  a fully fledged sequel an entirely new experience built from the ground up why there are so many
[8110.58s -> 8116.98s]  possibilities it could go in so many different directions this is what fans have truly been
[8116.98s -> 8140.33s]  asking for investor showcase the end is never the end again stanley parable too calling it
[8140.33s -> 8146.97s]  the stanley parable too is just so much catchier than ultra deluxe don't you think ultra deluxe
[8146.97s -> 8154.17s]  what does it even mean but the stanley parable too now that's an artistic statement right there
[8154.17s -> 8161.37s]  yeah it's future-oriented it screams progress and innovation and long-term franchising potential
[8161.93s -> 8172.31s]  yeah i i yeah i agree oh but stanley parable colon let's get it i think would have
[8172.31s -> 8194.38s]  dragged in more people stanley parable colon fuck you people would be like what is that
[8198.71s -> 8210.54s]  they're back two doors win win sequential mid-share color red leverage paradigm shift
[8210.54s -> 8234.95s]  synergy oh this is the graphics hmm i would say i'm more of a fan of the fur i like the fur
[8234.95s -> 8239.10s]  this maybe i think of the one with the good one all the others are too i don't know i don't like
[8239.10s -> 8245.05s]  them i think they wanted the right idea number three number three that looks like a soap opera
[8245.05s -> 8260.63s]  no now to be clear i haven't quite nailed down what exactly the stanley parable too is going to
[8260.63s -> 8266.55s]  be but let's take a look at some of the features i've been developing for it i figure that if i
[8266.55s -> 8272.39s]  can loosely organize a handful of interesting concepts surely the game will sort of naturally
[8272.39s -> 8278.63s]  spring up around them it'll all work itself out game development is much more of a fuzzy magic
[8278.63s -> 8287.74s]  than anything scientific or logical really number two chat i feel like i drew these the end is never
[8287.74s -> 8306.12s]  the end again two two that looks like a movie poster this way to the show floor all right what
[8306.12s -> 8330.62s]  about new features what we got new features new content new features expo hall two whoa here we
[8330.62s -> 8343.90s]  are go on try out some of the new features merch is this all fake because i probably wear one of
[8343.90s -> 8360.39s]  these is this fake are these real things this t-shirt is the best new feature and then have
[8360.39s -> 8369.32s]  like the two on the back i would wear one of these what is that reassurance bucket the button that
[8369.32s -> 8376.09s]  says the name of the player that is playing the game hear your name in the game the button that
[8376.09s -> 8382.39s]  says the name of the player that's playing the game that's new back what do you mean back what
[8385.18s -> 8393.26s]  merch oh it's a qr code so it is real we want the qr code all right well get get close enough look
[8393.26s -> 8408.22s]  what do i want to tell you don't do it i'm not i i'll do it later i'll do it later i don't want
[8408.22s -> 8419.45s]  to do that right now no screenshots why is it making the sound that happens when you're about
[8419.45s -> 8433.85s]  to get like a phone call you guys know that sound that's fucking weird man this is the sound that
[8433.85s -> 8442.15s]  happens through speakers when your phone is about to ring that's so weird that's actually weird
[8442.15s -> 8455.13s]  the jump circle how do they get that sound how do they even know what that is enjoy the new
[8455.21s -> 8464.22s]  features okay name for the stanley parable too i asked myself what do players really want
[8464.22s -> 8470.38s]  and of course the first and most obvious answer is that they want to be individually recognized
[8470.38s -> 8475.66s]  and validated as people too big too small with that in mind my first addition to the game is
[8475.66s -> 8491.51s]  this button which speaks the name of the person playing the game isn't that wonderful try it here
[8491.51s -> 8504.98s]  uh is this gonna say my steam name because my steam name right now is fucking gas can
[8504.98s -> 8519.29s]  is it gas can right now sorry i should have clarified right now the button only says the
[8519.29s -> 8525.29s]  name jim but of course in the final game this button will say your name whatever name that is
[8525.29s -> 8530.89s]  here let's have you role play as jim i don't want to role play jim experience of this feature
[8530.89s -> 8537.77s]  just play along i promise you'll love it okay here we go let's take a deep breath clear your mind
[8537.77s -> 8544.65s]  forget whoever you are and simply become a person named jim i want you to imagine yourself living
[8544.65s -> 8551.93s]  as jim sleeping and waking as jim falling in love and being heartbroken as jim seizing all of the
[8551.93s -> 8558.33s]  world's possibilities as jim and as jim watching your dreams crumble into dust do you feel it
[8558.33s -> 8564.97s]  deeply i mean are you really truly jim right now and jim if so jeremy jim jeremy i mean press the
[8565.05s -> 8577.11s]  button yes you see what a thrill what a rush that was you the button described you do it again do
[8577.11s -> 8584.22s]  it again it hits even harder the second time if this were the only new feature in the stanley
[8584.22s -> 8589.34s]  parable too it would still be worth the money thrilling take a break from the jim button i'm
[8589.34s -> 8595.42s]  too emotionally drained from all of this personal validation oh there cowboy sometimes a person can
[8595.42s -> 8601.26s]  be too much jim i'm putting the jim button away otherwise soon you'll start to lose
[8601.26s -> 8620.95s]  all sense of who you actually are that's really loud oh all right a clip through the floor yeah
[8623.43s -> 8631.11s]  what are the new features are in this new game i actually kind of like that big button because
[8631.11s -> 8637.11s]  i really feel like it's going to be squishy and i can punch it and it'll resist me but it'll be
[8637.11s -> 8641.75s]  squishy so it'll be like you know what i mean it'll be like kind of full of i can like punch that
[8641.75s -> 8651.83s]  button that one is way too small the uh that one's kind of cool though because it's like a
[8651.83s -> 8657.96s]  like a pen cap right those are fun to do i would think this one's the wrong one yeah that's like
[8657.96s -> 8670.65s]  just basic i can't punch that one and i can't click that one frankly it's a waste of goddamn
[8670.65s -> 8681.48s]  time okay i suppose i could allow only people named jim to play the stanley parable too that
[8681.48s -> 8687.61s]  would actually save me the work of finishing this feature so what else is there there's this like
[8687.61s -> 8697.30s]  weird guy over there hold on epilogue i'm not ready for this an epilogue would be fun wouldn't
[8697.30s -> 8707.03s]  it stanley yes yes it will go at the end of the um well we'll figure that out later what's with

[8724.97s -> 8730.63s]  achievement it can't be that simple go the jump circle you know what stanley i actually think the
[8730.63s -> 8739.78s]  jump circle was a pretty good idea i'd like to hang on to that for the sequel what do i have any
[8739.78s -> 8757.66s]  more jumps this map free achievement the button that says the name merge settings world champion
[8757.66s -> 8764.50s]  stanley parable reassurance bucket infinite hole all right well i need to see this first

[8792.42s -> 8797.62s]  too you all run around gathering up these miniature stanley figurines and what's truly
[8797.62s -> 8802.42s]  innovative is that there were you're on the website for collecting all of them what i don't
[8802.42s -> 8808.42s]  want to stifle the intrinsic you're on the qr code you simply collect all of them and then you move

[9430.01s -> 9451.67s]  something happened that i'm not happy about but i'm gonna whatever i'm not happy about this but
[9451.67s -> 9490.84s]  it's funny to show great what's going on with you i'm fucking choking nice clickbait what do
[9490.84s -> 9501.19s]  you mean update this different person they're cycling through like streamers man it's different
[9501.19s -> 9506.71s]  person they're just like look we're gonna move on from this because right now i believe this is
[9506.71s -> 9522.98s]  jacksepticeye now jack it's a good game that's i fucking love that that's so fucking funny
[9523.62s -> 9552.76s]  oh wait i can collect these but jacksepticeye is not even live is he god it really is the worst
[9552.76s -> 9559.08s]  when you collect everything in a video game and then they give you a big fancy reward absolutely
[9559.08s -> 9578.34s]  tragic they have wait they wouldn't mean this what does it say man calls shawn all right let's keep
[9578.34s -> 9616.82s]  going wait that's his his name's his name's not jack it's whatever it's all right jim well your
[9616.82s -> 9634.98s]  name's jim oh all right let's go let's go to the bucket a common complaint of the stanley parable
[9634.98s -> 9639.90s]  was that it was confusing and paradoxical that it engendered a chaotic sense of
[9642.54s -> 9648.58s]  well i'm happy to say that after much consideration i've engineered a clever solution
[9648.58s -> 9655.99s]  to this fundamental problem with the game it's the stanley parable reassurance bucket you see
[9655.99s -> 9662.63s]  stanley anytime you're holding the bucket a sense of calm and ease will fill your mind and your heart
[9662.63s -> 9668.95s]  it's true as long as you hold on to the bucket the many disorienting contradictions of the stanley
[9668.95s -> 9675.59s]  parable will feel perfectly normal and perhaps even comforting you may even come to long for
[9675.59s -> 9682.15s]  the gentle embrace of jarring cognitive dissonance while the bucket is in your arms and to be honest
[9682.15s -> 9687.35s]  it's a much more convenient solution for me than actually redesigning the game to be less
[9687.35s -> 9693.43s]  uncomfortable can you imagine what a pain in the ass that would be yes the bucket is the perfect
[9693.43s -> 9699.21s]  solution come on give it a try did i like mess up my white balance like here or something
[9700.17s -> 9709.91s]  ah can you feel it the glow of comfort even in the face of crushing despair
[9709.91s -> 9715.59s]  must already be sweeping through your body and in fact can i say that i do believe the bucket lends
[9715.59s -> 9721.43s]  you an air of charisma as well i think that just holding it has made you the slightest bit more
[9721.43s -> 9727.50s]  attractive as a person the benefits of the bucket seem to go on and on don't they put it down all
[9727.58s -> 9741.91s]  this and more awaits you in the stanley parable too it's a puke bucket can i be gross for a second
[9741.91s -> 9761.53s]  let's see does anyone give out awards for most enjoyable bucket in a video game that really
[9761.53s -> 9786.17s]  should be an award if it isn't already all right um so how do i put this down what about the
[9786.17s -> 9802.87s]  infinite hole i can't put this down what about the infinite hole get yours right now pull the
[9802.87s -> 9810.38s]  lever receive your new achievement no more steps it just works get yours right now now here's
[9810.38s -> 9815.26s]  something special you remember that broken test achievement that got left in the game on accident
[9815.26s -> 9820.94s]  yeah what the fuck's up with that technology to simply give you the achievement yes you see you'll
[9820.94s -> 9825.74s]  come to this lever and when you pull it the achievement will be given to you it's as simple
[9825.74s -> 9837.53s]  as that if this was real life i piss in this bucket right now i gotta pee right now there's
[9837.53s -> 9847.80s]  no bathroom here okay perhaps i should have clarified this is technology that will exist
[9847.80s -> 9853.80s]  right now the achievement is still fully broken i'm not a wizard stanley but i guarantee it will be
[9853.80s -> 9859.40s]  fixed in the sequel to at last satisfy the hordes of ravenous fans all over the world who have been
[9859.40s -> 9874.06s]  uproariously demanding this feature gamers we hear you and i gamers i can't get it come on
[9874.06s -> 9884.18s]  really come on quick i can't get this bullshit all right i'm gonna pay i'll be right back it'd be
[9884.18s -> 10107.94s]  like two minutes two what's going on guys welcome back i am gonna be hopping back into the stair in
[10107.94s -> 10118.06s]  stanley parable 2 all you gamers uh thanks for joining me as always let's uh get back to it if
[10118.06s -> 10127.29s]  we could let me adjust this because this needs to be brighter i don't have mad scientist here right
[10127.29s -> 10159.50s]  now but that's all right that worse or better for detail what'd you just say dude this stream is like
[10159.50s -> 10181.10s]  not funny whatever that's your opinion i think it looks fine whatever all right so i had the bucket
[10193.91s -> 10197.67s]  eat the horror get the achievement i i how am i supposed to get the achievement what do you mean
[10197.67s -> 10211.38s]  get the achievement what the fuck i can't get it what do you mean you can no i can't stop
[10211.38s -> 10216.50s]  i'm gonna start fucking timing people up but it wasn't for a few days you know all right i can't
[10216.50s -> 10226.60s]  get the achievement doesn't work please oh that doesn't work i probably have to do something
[10226.60s -> 10236.84s]  special i definitely have to do something special and come back here oh the lever i just i did it
[10236.84s -> 10251.45s]  already lying to me how you guys doing you guys doing good how are you how you doing today all
[10251.45s -> 10258.34s]  right actually how are you what other exhibits haven't we seen yet um what actually have i not
[10258.34s -> 10270.25s]  done i did the jump circle i did this i ate a minute oh i like that one uh free achievement
[10270.25s -> 10278.47s]  the button that says the name merch settings world champion was that okay settings world champion is
[10279.80s -> 10289.50s]  by the merch table let's do that is the bucket merch
[10290.38s -> 10304.34s]  settings world championship where's that here is this in okay i'll be honest i haven't yet
[10304.34s -> 10310.34s]  decided on this one i think that in the new version the office could use a bit of decoration
[10310.34s -> 10319.91s]  like balloons but get well someday and happy 12th birthday which would you go with happy 12th
[10319.91s -> 10334.31s]  birthday okay get well someday happy 12th birthday i think it's gonna be 12th birthday
[10337.34s -> 10342.57s]  you know sometimes when you solicit another person's opinion it makes you realize that you
[10342.57s -> 10349.93s]  knew which one you actually really wanted all along get well someday it is hey that's not fair
[10349.93s -> 10365.45s]  i said i wanted to get a happy whatever is that it no this option maybe i should have gone with no
[10365.45s -> 10371.05s]  no i've made my decision we're moving on no screenshots what if i take a screenshot
[10371.05s -> 10381.72s]  what a screenshot on steam that i might have remapped it f12 no what what what what could
[10381.72s -> 10395.83s]  i possibly remapped it to oh okay um i didn't do the hole where's the hole i didn't go down
[10395.83s -> 10412.12s]  there okay where's the hole okay office decorations epilogue collectibles infinite hole k where's k
[10412.12s -> 10420.26s]  all right so i need to go what's a9 collectibles so i gotta go from here i gotta go straight then
[10420.26s -> 10441.72s]  left i get out of here and go left this way right this way that's the name button down here
[10441.72s -> 10475.51s]  where was it over here oh there is infinite hole i was just in here wait oh oh huh huh i don't get
[10475.51s -> 10493.38s]  it i was already here where's the infinite hole i was i was already here this way he's actually
[10493.38s -> 10504.36s]  trolling i'm okay this is it i don't know i did that that was go that way infinite hole chart
[10504.36s -> 10514.44s]  educational use only it just keeps going for real stanley here's an idea that i'm truly fond of
[10514.44s -> 10520.92s]  it's never been done before in a video game this is in fact a hole that you can fall down forever
[10520.92s -> 10527.80s]  that's right infinite falling you can fall until the end of time if you like a standing forward
[10527.80s -> 10543.86s]  for video games as a medium okay so if i jump in that is it over i have to start over i throw the
[10543.86s -> 10557.69s]  bucket let's go you see isn't it wonderful one of my more ingenious concoctions if i do say so
[10557.69s -> 10562.81s]  it's gonna make me puke now then since you've gotten to see the infinite hole you can press
[10562.81s -> 10572.58s]  the teleport button to pop back up to the top and we can continue onward what if i hmm now i don't
[10572.58s -> 10578.34s]  know be a bummer but i do recommend you use the teleport button to go back to the top maybe do it
[10578.34s -> 10584.10s]  on the sooner rather than later spectrum of things it actually infinite or am i gonna splat
[10584.10s -> 10592.76s]  on the ground i don't know quite how to say this tactfully but it's possible that i slightly
[10592.76s -> 10599.00s]  exaggerated the infinite nature of the hole is it a very very deep hole to be certain it is
[10599.64s -> 10605.32s]  it's an extremely deep hole i don't want anyone to say that it isn't an astonishingly deep hole it
[10605.32s -> 10611.72s]  is is it infinite well that sort of depends on your definition of infinity it's got bigger
[10611.72s -> 10619.88s]  perspective the infinite is merely philosophical in nature it's more of a okay well good for you
[10619.88s -> 10625.00s]  you found the bottom of the hole i made live found me out stanley i'm a liar and a cheat and
[10625.00s -> 10631.24s]  you're so clever look i think the issue here is just that you're unusually fascinated by
[10631.24s -> 10637.88s]  falling true what normal person actually wants to fall infinitely i figured the hole was as deep as
[10637.88s -> 10643.80s]  anyone would actually need don't you put this on me maybe you're the problem how do i get out of
[10643.80s -> 10649.40s]  here the thing's got a little heated there i think we both said some things we didn't mean
[10649.40s -> 10656.84s]  why don't we just put all this behind us and agree to just call the whole mostly infinite if that
[10656.84s -> 10662.44s]  works for you then go ahead and press the teleport button to warp up to the top of that's a lie you
[10662.44s -> 10666.44s]  that's that's false advertising up here when you're ready false advertising i'm not going
[10666.44s -> 10689.24s]  anywhere till you fix it and make it actually infinite i got all day great now i'm very excited
[10689.24s -> 10696.12s]  oh for heaven you see i was right the problem is you take a big slide the problem is that you like
[10696.12s -> 10702.66s]  holes too much a normal person would have said yep that's an infinite hole right there goes on
[10702.66s -> 10708.50s]  forever till the end of time don't need to see it all but not you oh no no no no you have a weird
[10708.50s -> 10715.78s]  sort of oh hey did the hole seem even shorter to you this time i couldn't help but feel like
[10715.78s -> 10721.78s]  you spent a little less time in there than you did before i mean admittedly i didn't make an
[10721.78s -> 10726.42s]  infinite does this keep getting shorter and shorter that not infinite well i suppose once
[10726.42s -> 10730.74s]  again there's nothing to do here if you decide you've had enough of the hole you can hit the
[10730.74s -> 10738.66s]  teleport button and come join me up above had enough i'm positively thrilled gosh
[10738.66s -> 10749.06s]  how could i have guessed you're back in the hole if this stuff okay yeah i'm starting to become
[10749.06s -> 10754.74s]  extremely certain that the hole is not only not infinite but that it's growing steadily less and
[10754.74s -> 10760.02s]  less infinite i suspect that i'm starting to hit the point where it's no longer feasible to call
[10760.66s -> 10766.34s]  infinitely deep now it's just a kind of big hole for accountability and marketing what's going on
[10766.34s -> 10772.58s]  here stanley i have no explanation for the uncertain nature of the hole's length here
[10772.58s -> 10778.34s]  let's try something let's pop back up to the top and we'll see if it gets any shorter let's see it
[10778.34s -> 10785.54s]  well there it is the shame of my eyes come to haunt me oh my fucking ankle oh i know you're
[10785.62s -> 10788.74s]  just twisted it i stopped it it just bent it the other way
[10788.74s -> 10794.34s]  see this fucking goddamn stupid ass fucking lip on the ledge who am i to judge you just do
[10794.34s -> 10799.06s]  whatever it is you're here to do and hit the teleport button when you're ready to move on
[10799.06s -> 10808.52s]  fucking hurt i rolled my goddamn ankle hmm is the um teleport button not working
[10809.64s -> 10815.30s]  you sure well i mean what did you do i really don't have an explanation it was working just
[10815.30s -> 10824.92s]  a moment ago try it again still nothing well i suppose i suppose there is one thing i can
[10824.92s -> 10829.56s]  do to fix i can't climb out of here i'm out goodbye stanley you couldn't bear to be away
[10829.56s -> 10834.76s]  from the hole and now you'll get more time with it than you could ever have asked for it's a win
[10834.76s -> 10842.36s]  for everyone you get to be with the hole i get to do literally anything else take care stanley
[10842.36s -> 10847.24s]  i hope you and the whole have a wonderful rest of it hey i have a bucket though i can turn the
[10847.24s -> 10861.03s]  bucket around step on it and get out every pause button is a roman numeral just the two of us we
[10861.03s -> 10864.31s]  can make it if we try just the two of us just the two of us just the two of us building castles
[10866.04s -> 10911.19s]  meeting at 2 p.m sincerely management am i actually stuck in here uh well goodbye change
[10911.19s -> 10965.43s]  your perspective change your perception this is the this is the part where the bugs start crawling
[10965.43s -> 10971.67s]  all over everybody this is the exact music that gets played when like like just like roaches just
[10971.67s -> 11031.14s]  like everywhere in your reality i stopped what the fuck wait is it is it like cartoon music
[11040.63s -> 11047.13s]  actually leave me alone this is fun but you're awake it seems you had sort of dozed off drifting
[11047.13s -> 11055.22s]  away into because this hole is just so darn fascinating that i want you to be wide awake
[11055.22s -> 11061.22s]  for every second of it you don't want to miss a single moment so how about if i just pop in
[11061.22s -> 11067.54s]  from time to time and wake you up to keep you really truly focused on the whole from the looks
[11067.54s -> 11072.42s]  of things you and i will have many many years here in this hole does this payback for all the
[11072.42s -> 11082.68s]  skipping all of them stay alert stanley i'll be back this is my punishment for all the fast
[11082.68s -> 11105.43s]  forwarding are we doing it again oh back out here here we are go on try out some of the new features
[11105.91s -> 11135.29s]  okay go back to the hole that's what i was thinking is to go back to the hole yeah i can get another
[11135.29s -> 11139.10s]  bucket too should i get two buckets all right i'm gonna get two buckets and i'm going back to the
[11139.10s -> 11146.25s]  hole and then i'm gonna get wait i this is i can get two out of six right hold on let me do this
[11146.25s -> 11167.19s]  first wait one i can't get it i get another one shit are they actually hidden you need to do a
[11167.19s -> 11189.85s]  welding i will do a well don't worry can i get another one i can't get a second bucket i can
[11189.85s -> 11198.86s]  only have one they don't it doesn't reset it just sends you the yeah okay all right i want to go back
[11198.86s -> 11214.92s]  to the hole oh the balloons are actually here now that's fine all right whole time i want to go back
[11214.92s -> 11228.14s]  in here you should do the clown world i figured there's probably a clown world hey you're gonna

[11256.36s -> 11277.64s]  get up there oh i can go up here mostly mostly infinite hole settings world championship all
[11277.64s -> 11299.06s]  right let's do that why is it closed what are you talking about it's closed check your settings

[12123.86s -> 12132.42s]  out every level of bump scocity in the stanley parable too all right first of all um i gotta

[12137.88s -> 12145.35s]  invert no control of vibration now get out of here english subtitles medium with a little bit
[12145.35s -> 12154.58s]  of opacity i don't need all this okay what about is my video settings fine and we're good all
[12154.58s -> 12182.71s]  right we're good yeah everything's fine okay bump scocity was bump scocity thousand i appreciate
[12182.71s -> 12199.27s]  the help though dev i'm brave i have a p brain so tweet now no i remember was so bad at following
[12199.27s -> 12213.35s]  directions it's incredible he wasn't fired years ago but i but i went i did everything
[12220.22s -> 12240.14s]  all right so what does what does bump scocity do oh this is the epilogue room okay very cool
[12240.14s -> 12267.48s]  did i miss any of the rooms am i done i'm done here oh this is a cool area this place was cool
[12267.48s -> 12286.94s]  that was a fun exhibit now where do i go can i leave oh there's an exit right where is it
[12286.94s -> 12301.78s]  it's around here somewhere where's the exit i think it's down here um yeah i saw the tweet
[12310.73s -> 12324.26s]  all right have you seen everything you wanted to i think so to move on now i think i am what's this
[12324.26s -> 12330.90s]  so stanley what do you think do you like all of the new features yes i know it's not exactly
[12330.90s -> 12336.42s]  clear yet how exactly these features will come together as one single coherent video game but
[12336.42s -> 12342.73s]  i can feel it in my soul it's going to work there's definitely a good game in there somewhere
[12342.73s -> 12349.03s]  say let's do an experiment i'll arrange these new features together and we'll see whether or not
[12349.03s -> 12360.22s]  it coheres into a meaningful gameplay experience okay are you ready here it is i give you
[12360.22s -> 12372.18s]  what the stanley parable two what if i what are the chapstick um well i mean there's potential here
[12372.18s -> 12379.19s]  right it's sort of okay never mind hold on let me do a different arrangement i didn't eat it did i
[12379.19s -> 12387.38s]  eat it yes this is much better i feel good about it here we go i didn't i didn't need it too well
[12387.38s -> 12395.08s]  that's oh yeah who am i kidding stanley this isn't a coherent video game at all it's a lot of gags
[12395.16s -> 12400.86s]  and i do very much enjoy creating gags but they don't add up to anything i didn't need it i wanted
[12400.86s -> 12406.70s]  more than anything to create a sequel that would capture all the magic of the first game i wanted
[12406.70s -> 12411.98s]  fans to love it no matter how good these gags are they wouldn't stand on their own they would need
[12411.98s -> 12418.58s]  the structure in the gameplay of the original oh yeah wait maybe that's it i can take the original
[12418.58s -> 12425.22s]  stanley parable and simply well insert a few of my new features into it tastefully of course
[12425.22s -> 12431.42s]  with respect with care for the vision and integrity of the original game would it possibly
[12431.42s -> 12437.90s]  work i suppose it could but it would need a really really tremendous title screen a title
[12437.90s -> 12446.02s]  screen that says with bold and uncompromising conviction this is the stanley parable two
[12446.02s -> 12455.90s]  let me see if i can whip something up like the designs that were out front go ahead take a look
[12455.90s -> 12483.11s]  oh look at that stanley parable two here we go this is the story of a man named stanley stanley
[12483.11s -> 12489.83s]  worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number four two seven employee number
[12489.83s -> 12496.63s]  four two seven's job was simple he sat at his desk in room four two seven and he pushed buttons on a
[12496.63s -> 12502.63s]  keyboard orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push
[12502.63s -> 12509.59s]  how long to push them and in what order this is what employee four two seven did every day
[12509.59s -> 12515.03s]  of every month of every year bump viscosity looks crazy yeah others might have considered it so
[12515.03s -> 12519.99s]  ranting stanley relished every moment that the orders came in it's a lot of bump viscosity it's
[12519.99s -> 12525.11s]  making me made exactly the backs of my eyeballs are itchy stanley you know i mean that's kind of
[12525.11s -> 12530.38s]  when a lot of bump viscosity happens that's when you get there's a lot one day something very
[12530.38s -> 12536.46s]  peculiar happened something that would forever change stanley something he would never quite
[12536.46s -> 12543.69s]  forget he had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order
[12543.69s -> 12549.53s]  had arrived on the monitor for him to follow no one had showed up to give him instructions call
[12549.53s -> 12557.45s]  a meeting or even say hi never in all his years at the company had this happened this complete
[12557.45s -> 12565.85s]  isolation something was very clearly wrong shocked frozen solid stanley found himself unable to move
[12565.85s -> 12572.33s]  for the longest time but as he came to his wits and regained his senses he got up from his desk
[12572.33s -> 12579.34s]  and stepped out of his office okay so should i do the same thing i did last time but stanley simply
[12579.34s -> 12583.74s]  couldn't handle the pressure that's like what i did last time to make a decision what if a crucial
[12583.74s -> 12589.98s]  outcome fell under his responsibility he had never been trained for that no this couldn't go
[12589.98s -> 12595.18s]  any way except badly the thing to do now stanley thought to himself is to wait does this change
[12595.18s -> 12603.18s]  nothing will hurt me nothing this doesn't change me in here i can be happy forever i will be happy
[12603.18s -> 12609.58s]  stanley waited oh this is different this is not different then days had years gone by he no longer
[12610.06s -> 12614.78s]  all right this is not different but the one thing he knew for sure beyond any doubt was that if he
[12614.78s -> 12620.46s]  waited long enough it was my bucket answers would come eventually someday they would have stopped
[12620.46s -> 12627.74s]  wasting our time very soon now this will end he will be spoken to he will be told what to do
[12628.71s -> 12637.45s]  now it's just a little bit closer now it's even closer here it comes all right so that doesn't
[12637.45s -> 12645.11s]  change so what changed balloons are here uncomfortable and stanley decided that as
[12645.11s -> 12650.07s]  soon as he found a new space he felt safe in that he would never leave it again in his life
[12650.71s -> 12660.90s]  what about the claw the brim closet oh my bucket stanley picked up the bucket nice i feel happy now
[12666.18s -> 12671.66s]  wait that's two inputs now oh every time i come back i do another input i wonder what happens
[12674.07s -> 12686.87s]  that's cool all right we'll find out in a minute we'll check it out stanley clutched the bucket
[12686.87s -> 12704.25s]  tightly to his chest and entered the door still no one was here stanley needed the bucket's warmth
[12704.25s -> 12709.45s]  and comfort now more than ever okay perhaps his boss's office was where he'd find answers
[12710.01s -> 12721.64s]  this is open again nice oh stanley can you feel it the broom closet it wants the bucket
[12721.64s -> 12733.40s]  oh
[12737.08s -> 12743.56s]  other cleaning supplies good for you stanley don't give him don't hand over the bucket i know how
[12743.56s -> 12748.28s]  hard it must be given the pressure that the broom closet is putting on your shoulders right now but
[12748.28s -> 12754.28s]  you have to be strong this is your bucket this is your companion and lifelong friend fine you
[12754.28s -> 12760.46s]  can't hand it over we're getting into name calling now it seems this is how low the broom closet
[12760.46s -> 12765.26s]  has said that it has to resort to this stream of petty insults simply in order to get you to
[12765.26s -> 12770.54s]  hand over the bucket yeah stanley i never liked this broom closet for a variety of reasons
[12770.54s -> 12776.33s]  me neither do i this is worse than i had imagined yeah fuck this place the closet has the goal to
[12776.33s -> 12781.69s]  imply that you and the bucket are not truly deep and lasting friends what that your relationship
[12781.69s -> 12787.05s]  is purely superficial and convenient oh shut up life is super null and meaningless when they say
[12787.05s -> 12792.17s]  that the same sort of kinship towards any inanimate object which happened to lay in your path in an
[12792.17s -> 12798.17s]  even partially enticing manner well i never i thought they i thought we were friends lay into
[12798.17s -> 12803.93s]  it really tell the broom closet off for its demeaning comments expand on the wide variety
[12804.01s -> 12809.77s]  of experiences you and the bucket have shared together go through each of them point by point
[12809.77s -> 12814.01s]  share your journal entries detailing the rich emotional landscape of your feelings for the
[12814.01s -> 12821.99s]  bucket as they have changed and evolved over the years yeah let him have it it stinks like a public
[12821.99s -> 12829.82s]  bathroom in here and the walls need to be painted and okay i've got you something which i think will
[12829.82s -> 12838.04s]  help settle this debate once and for all here we go yeah now it's settled yeah no more debate
[12838.04s -> 12844.52s]  no more discussion take a hike broom closet with all your meandering philosophical diatribes
[12844.52s -> 12849.00s]  about the nature of cleaning supplies and their relationship to broom closets in the natural
[12849.00s -> 12857.69s]  yeah yeah let me kick the fucking you man fuck you what are you gonna do fuck you right i've got a
[12857.69s -> 12862.57s]  second sticker back here and i'm going to slap it on as well because i think it's appropriate
[12862.57s -> 12870.49s]  but fuck up yeah see yeah i feel that it works because the sticker is also a bucket that way if
[12870.49s -> 12875.21s]  you're ever unsure whether the thing you're holding is a bucket too far look down at this
[12875.21s -> 12881.69s]  sticker and say to yourself oh it's a bucket there really is a wide variety of applications for this
[12881.69s -> 12889.93s]  sticker violence doesn't solve anything dude no i just like kicked this thing i just kicked like
[12889.93s -> 12895.05s]  this metal thing take the name calling and the dismissal of your kinship with the bucket but now
[12895.05s -> 12900.09s]  the broom closet is just giving us a silent treatment and to be honest i'm sick of the
[12900.09s -> 12905.21s]  pettiness on display you can stay here all you like but i've had it with this impetulant room
[12905.21s -> 12911.85s]  of cleaning supplies easily the most childish such room i've ever been in i'll see you outside and
[12911.85s -> 12919.37s]  we can get on with the story about you and your bucket bro you didn't really fucking say those
[12919.37s -> 12936.81s]  things did you did you say that you didn't say those things right man really what a disappointing
[12936.81s -> 12942.09s]  disappointing coming to a staircase stanley and the bucket walked upstairs to the boss's office
[12942.09s -> 12959.91s]  okay scared me why remember no reward for collecting all of these only the intrinsic
[12959.91s -> 12965.67s]  pleasure of a job well done you can't buy that sort of happiness stanley god knows i've tried
[12965.67s -> 12972.07s]  so i employ you to savor each and every moment you come across one of these beautiful figurines
[12972.95s -> 12980.94s]  okay to be rich is it a crime to commit crimes isn't it rich what a life it would be to have
[12980.94s -> 12989.48s]  to pick just one you definitely aren't cleaning this every day and like you just use your bathroom
[12989.48s -> 12993.56s]  wall to write all this shit and somebody else has to take it off and then you come back and
[12993.56s -> 12999.66s]  do it again you're annoying somebody here and like you should just stop write it on a fucking
[12999.66s -> 13017.11s]  notepad stepping wait manager's office stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication
[13017.11s -> 13023.21s]  of any human life crushed by the weight of this revelation stanford stanley gets the correct code
[13023.21s -> 13030.73s]  by sheer luck got it was it the bucket knew all along was the bucket guiding him yes this is
[13030.73s -> 13042.95s]  certainly the most logical explanation what about the piano nothing with the piano
[13044.39s -> 13057.00s]  nothing but the piano hey don't i die here oh another miniature stanley figurine i only need
[13057.00s -> 13061.80s]  three more you know there really must be a snappier name for these things what about
[13061.80s -> 13069.32s]  mini stands stanley figs oh what about stanley yes stanley i think i like that
[13069.32s -> 13075.56s]  another stan lorraine under your belt okay what happens when i get six treatment thank you
[13076.36s -> 13089.42s]  all right this time i'm going to turn the mind control thing on go back up i can't the elevator
[13089.42s -> 13096.34s]  race downward plummeting towards an unknown fate it would be all stanley could do to keep himself
[13096.34s -> 13102.58s]  together if not for the bucket soothing him comforting him reassuring that in this darkest
[13102.66s -> 13108.74s]  moment of uncertainty he would be all right the bucket is here for you stanley everything
[13108.74s -> 13119.14s]  will be fine all right stanley and the bucket walked straight ahead through the large door
[13119.14s -> 13127.30s]  that read the mind control facility okay i could go that way or you could go with this way with
[13127.30s -> 13142.86s]  the bucket i'm gonna turn it on i'm gonna turn it on what happens when you turn it on the lights
[13142.94s -> 13149.66s]  rose on an enormous room packed with television screens what horrible secret did this place hold
[13149.66s -> 13158.92s]  stanley and the bucket both wandered to themselves yeah i'm gonna turn it on and see what happens
[13163.06s -> 13169.22s]  i want to do the input thing again monitors jumped and stanley nearly dropped the bucket in shock
[13169.78s -> 13176.55s]  everyone in the office was being videotaped monitored like guinea pigs the bucket had never
[13176.55s -> 13181.27s]  seen anything like this and it very nearly burst into tears as stanley
[13182.39s -> 13197.29s]  reassuring it that everything would be fine okay now yeah live bucket reaction was the bucket under
[13197.29s -> 13203.29s]  the mind control facilities influence as well had the bucket been told to do things it didn't wish
[13203.29s -> 13210.33s]  to do what kinds of things does a bucket want to do or not want to do in the first place these
[13210.41s -> 13217.32s]  questions raised furiously and stanley okay if i put the bucket on my head will the mind control
[13217.32s -> 13226.79s]  radiation get through the bucket no he screamed into the bucket he couldn't accept it his own
[13226.79s -> 13233.83s]  life in someone else's control never he squeezed the bucket tighter his one friend in the entire
[13233.83s -> 13240.23s]  world where did i just go this point he could trust no one except for the bucket where did i
[13240.23s -> 13247.99s]  just go wait did i just leave oh no wait what but here is the proof the heart of the operation
[13247.99s -> 13255.67s]  controls labeled with emotions happy or sad or content walking eating working all of it
[13255.67s -> 13262.23s]  monitored and commanded from this very place and as the cold reality of his past began to sink in
[13262.23s -> 13267.99s]  stanley decided that this are going there would never again exert its terrible power over another
[13268.63s -> 13273.11s]  what if i walk down here for he and the bucket would dismantle the controls for good
[13273.67s -> 13281.27s]  two best friends stanley and the bucket up against the world they high-fived in a really cool way
[13281.27s -> 13291.64s]  and the bucket made a sassy comment about taking down the system okay so let's turn it on i want
[13291.64s -> 13299.48s]  to turn this on when at last they came to the source of the room's power stanley and the bucket
[13299.48s -> 13304.84s]  knew it was their obligation to put an end to this horrible place and to everything it stood
[13304.84s -> 13314.84s]  for but at the last second the bucket jumped in and pressed the button to turn on the controls
[13314.84s -> 13321.16s]  double cross stanley gasped in horror had this been the bucket's plan all along to take over the
[13321.16s -> 13327.06s]  machine and claim the power for itself how could the bucket have betrayed him like this stanley
[13327.06s -> 13332.98s]  was prepared to throw the bucket away in disgust when suddenly an image appeared upon the enormous
[13332.98s -> 13344.39s]  screen birds silly silly birds the control buttons became active again okay do i want
[13344.39s -> 13357.11s]  eagle or do i want um sparrow sparrow stanley flipped through one video of silly birds after
[13357.11s -> 13363.11s]  another and then it dawned on him this wasn't a mind control facility at all what is it was a
[13363.11s -> 13370.23s]  facility for monitoring and surveilling silly birds all over the world what a silly bird only
[13370.23s -> 13377.59s]  a facade to disguise its true intentions at the bucket known this all along stanley marveled at
[13377.59s -> 13382.95s]  the metal genius in his hands the one who had pointed him towards this incredible discovery
[13383.67s -> 13388.55s]  stanley and the bucket never found freedom because they spent the rest of their lives here in this
[13388.55s -> 13396.23s]  place flipping through lives oh wow of the silliest birds imaginable of all the possible paths his
[13396.31s -> 13399.59s]  life could have taken it looked like robots like mechanical
[13400.95s -> 13412.09s]  and stanley was happy no i want to see more of those that don't cut me off i want to see more
[13412.09s -> 13423.77s]  of that when stanley came to a set of two open doors he entered the door on his left where's
[13423.77s -> 13430.31s]  my bucket this was not the correct way to the meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well
[13430.31s -> 13435.11s]  perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first just to admire it i can't do it without the
[13435.11s -> 13439.51s]  bucket i'm nothing without the bucket if you're nothing without the bucket then you're nothing
[13442.87s -> 13449.13s]  butterflies in his stomach giddy in a way he had never known before was it this rupert eager to
[13449.13s -> 13458.06s]  get back to business stanley took the first open door on his left i've never gone this way and so
[13458.06s -> 13463.34s]  he detoured through the maintenance section walked straight ahead to the opposite door and got back
[13463.34s -> 13476.30s]  on track no i went this way but stanley didn't want to go back to the office
[13476.30s -> 13481.74s]  he wanted to wander about and get even further off track so now in order to get back he needed
[13481.74s -> 13505.69s]  to go left right oh no no it's to the right my mistake no no no no not the right why would i
[13505.69s -> 13512.01s]  have ever said it was to the right what was i thinking it's clearly oh dear would you hold
[13512.01s -> 13521.86s]  on for a minute please that door do a long rip now let's see we went down right left down left
[13521.86s -> 13530.10s]  right yep yep okay okay yes i've got it now this story is absolutely definitely this way okay wait
[13530.82s -> 13549.62s]  can't go that way have to go this way kind of scary oh the mind control room no no no no no no no
[13549.62s -> 13554.26s]  no this isn't right at all you're not supposed to be here yet this is all a spoiler quick stanley
[13554.26s -> 13560.50s]  close your eyes i already saw this okay okay we just we just have to get back to um oh who am i
[13560.50s -> 13566.82s]  kidding it's all rubbish now the whole story completely unusable however rather than waste
[13566.82s -> 13571.62s]  my time trying to salvage this nonsense we'll just restart the game from oh he's sending me
[13571.62s -> 13579.64s]  back to the beginning suppose we don't wander so far off track hmm okay rubbish all right where's
[13579.64s -> 13586.52s]  my bucket all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting
[13586.52s -> 13593.18s]  room perhaps he had simply missed a memo was the input thing right it was i could do the input
[13593.18s -> 13610.54s]  thing i can't there's another input input come on let me do input three really really and the
[13610.54s -> 13615.37s]  bucket's not here either that's sad that's really sad i don't have my bucket how am i
[13615.37s -> 13630.06s]  supposed to ever play this game again i missed the bucket when stanley wait what no no i restarted
[13630.06s -> 13635.61s]  i swear i definitely restarted the game over completely fresh everything should be what did
[13635.61s -> 13640.97s]  something change stanley did you change anything when we were back in that room with all the
[13640.97s -> 13647.61s]  monitors did you move the story somewhere i didn't have my bucket hold on am i asking you i'm the one
[13647.61s -> 13654.17s]  who wrote the story was right here just a minute ago i know for sure that it's here somewhere okay
[13654.17s -> 13689.74s]  then it's an adventure god stanley let's find the story um this one oh by the way i got a blood wash
[13689.74s -> 13695.50s]  and murder house i'll say it this is the worst adventure i've ever been on i can promise you
[13695.50s -> 13701.43s]  there definitely was a story here before do we just do we need to restart the game again
[13701.43s -> 13705.99s]  no i'll find it unlikely that we'll ever progress by starting over and over again
[13705.99s -> 13710.23s]  i got it it's got to be better than this i got it okay let's give it a shot no i got it i just
[13710.23s -> 13716.54s]  got it oh my god it's another one of those kind of short horror games right all of his co-workers
[13716.54s -> 13721.82s]  were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room if you guys have any more of
[13721.82s -> 13738.89s]  those like two three hours short horror games i you're so much louder than the game am i am i
[13738.89s -> 13746.14s]  good okay yep it's worse where the doors go what the fuck remembering this wrong it's oh dude it's
[13746.14s -> 13754.28s]  pop it's because of this this is it's because i turned everything down the story is back where
[13754.28s -> 13763.53s]  we just came from why don't we go back the other direction and see if we missed anything where's
[13763.53s -> 13770.63s]  my game i i paid for a fucking game i paid for a game and it's not here i'm just quit i'm quitting
[13781.51s -> 13795.29s]  uh i knew we'd miss something what the story here it comes no wait never mind not the story
[13795.29s -> 13808.63s]  the fuck okay let's head back the other way and retrace our steps i don't like this well i'll be
[13808.63s -> 13814.79s]  honest i don't recognize this place at all is this the story i don't think so i can't quite recall
[13814.79s -> 13821.40s]  but i believe my story took place in an office building it is that correct hmm do you remember
[13821.64s -> 13826.84s]  me what do you know what since i've completely forgotten what we were supposed to be doing
[13826.84s -> 13833.24s]  how about no don't restart the game again oh congratulations oh that worked i know you put
[13833.24s -> 13842.28s]  in a lot of hard work and it really paid off so good job oh no i don't feel right about this i
[13842.28s -> 13848.20s]  did it we both know you didn't put in any actual work for that win some people win fair and square
[13848.28s -> 13854.81s]  and this was not one of those situations okay i'm getting weirded out by whatever this place is
[13854.81s -> 13864.30s]  i don't care what might happen this time i have to restart stanley parable two adventure lines
[13864.30s -> 13870.38s]  time to make sure we don't get lost i've employed the help of the stanley parable adventure line
[13870.94s -> 13883.14s]  just follow the line okay how simple is that that's more like it no input oh well okay
[13883.86s -> 13911.59s]  everybody left no no i'm done we're leaving it up to the line from now on all right fine fine
[13917.72s -> 13938.02s]  okay you see the line knows where the story is it's over in this direction onward stanley
[13938.02s -> 13944.66s]  to destiny though here's a thought wouldn't wherever we end up be our destination even if
[13944.66s -> 13951.06s]  there's no story there no or to put it another way is the story of no destination still a story
[13951.06s -> 13957.22s]  no simply by the act of moving forward are we implying a journey such that a destination
[13957.22s -> 13962.66s]  is inevitably conjured into being via the very manifestation of the nature of life itself
[13962.66s -> 13966.98s]  story case stanley i need to follow this train of thought for a minute just stick with me i'll let
[13966.98s -> 13972.66s]  you finish it now we can both agree that the nature of existence is in fact a byproduct of
[13972.66s -> 13977.86s]  one subjective experience of that existence and just waiting for my turn to talk now i'm not
[13977.86s -> 13982.98s]  listening at all i'm just waiting for my turn to talk rests inside of your subjective experience
[13982.98s -> 13988.90s]  of this office is this office in fact the skeleton of my own relative experiential
[13988.90s -> 13996.65s]  mental subjective construct here hang on we're back there well i'd like to apologize
[13996.65s -> 14002.49s]  not sure where i was going with all that you know what i think what we need right now is a bit of
[14002.49s -> 14009.80s]  music to lighten the mood i agree a story is a narrative construct
[14072.14s -> 14100.06s]  uh i got i missed the line i didn't do it right wait what wait what way too dang cut the music
[14100.06s -> 14108.31s]  go back and look at that fern stanley this fern what's way too dank important later in the story
[14108.31s -> 14118.63s]  make sure you study it closely and remember it carefully you won't want to miss anything i
[14118.63s -> 14124.20s]  can understand the shape and the size and the um directions it's going and that's fern i think
[14124.20s -> 14136.94s]  i got it okay i got it fern fern whatever there's a fern wait what we're back at the office no no no
[14136.94s -> 14142.62s]  line you do know we're looking for the stanley parable right the story is any of this ringing a
[14142.62s -> 14178.87s]  bell um this way i guess not oh no no no spoilers how could you have done this to us and after we
[14178.87s -> 14184.71s]  trusted you after everything we've been through you no i can't take this anymore to hell with it
[14184.71s -> 14195.62s]  restart did i follow the line still you know what stanley i say forget the adventure line what's it
[14195.62s -> 14201.22s]  ever done for us we're intelligent people right why can't we make up our own story yeah we could
[14201.22s -> 14207.46s]  exciting daring mysterious oh this all sounds perfectly doable why don't we simply start
[14207.54s -> 14223.59s]  wandering in well i don't know how about this direction now yes this is exciting
[14223.59s -> 14227.99s]  just me and stanley forging a new path a new story well it could be anything
[14227.99s -> 14233.99s]  what do you want our story to be go wild use your imagination i want to be a knight whatever it
[14233.99s -> 14243.54s]  might be stanley i'm ready for it i'll be a knight the staff that has spells and i want to fight a
[14243.54s -> 14248.98s]  dragon and i want to win oh no not you again i don't care about anything i'd also like to
[14248.98s -> 14255.22s]  veto the line from having any role in our awesome new story no lines or monitor rooms just don't
[14255.22s -> 14276.04s]  acknowledge it we should be fine you'd be a lion yeah i wouldn't be a lion ah a choice we get to
[14276.04s -> 14282.12s]  make a decision from here the story is in another choice how important we mustn't squander the
[14282.12s -> 14287.48s]  opportunity in fact i believe i need a minute to think here just walk in circles for a minute
[14288.36s -> 14294.60s]  okay so i know that each door has to lead somewhere which means that somewhere the
[14294.60s -> 14301.80s]  place where we're trying to go this is fun to walk around this door that leads here and that in turn
[14301.80s -> 14308.44s]  means that our destination corresponds with the counter-inverted reverse doors origin
[14308.44s -> 14315.16s]  so starting from the right let us ask will taking the right door lead us to where we're going
[14315.16s -> 14320.76s]  and since the answer is clearly yes then by all accounts the door on the right is the correct one
[14320.76s -> 14329.91s]  that's not another victory for logic come stanley our destiny awaits this is my only choice i have
[14329.91s -> 14349.26s]  to go through i have to guys do this this is kind of fun i'm breaking the rules now just want to
[14349.26s -> 14353.00s]  be a little bit edgy there hold up what's this
[14355.43s -> 14361.91s]  confusion ending you're telling me that's what this is it's all one giant ending
[14362.47s -> 14369.77s]  and we're supposed to restart the game but eight eight times that's really how all this goes
[14370.82s -> 14377.43s]  it's all determined so now according to the schedule i restart again then what
[14377.43s -> 14383.37s]  am i just supposed to forget well what if i don't want to forget my mind goes blank simply
[14383.37s -> 14388.41s]  because it's written here on this thing line the line line after long stanley dies well
[14388.97s -> 14396.41s]  i die me why don't i get to decide why don't i get a say in all of this is it really find a bookstore
[14396.41s -> 14402.01s]  no it can't be i don't want it to be i don't want the game to keep restarting i don't want
[14402.01s -> 14406.97s]  to forget what's going on i don't want to be trapped like this i won't restart the game i
[14406.97s -> 14414.01s]  won't do it i won't do it i won't do it i don't want to do that i don't want to see you there
[14414.01s -> 14420.79s]  and i don't want to see the turtle did we do it wearing a hat the cycle the um whatever it is
[14420.79s -> 14427.96s]  that made this schedule how would we even know will someone come for us will something happen
[14427.96s -> 14437.19s]  somebody said he's gonna do it you were fucking right okay i guess now we just wait you know
[14437.75s -> 14443.11s]  i suppose in some way that this is a kind of story wouldn't you agree i'm not quite sure if
[14443.11s -> 14447.51s]  we're in the destination or the journey though they're always saying that life is about the
[14447.51s -> 14453.35s]  journey and not the destination so why is it why is it counted off right now we'll find out won't
[14453.35s -> 14465.75s]  we eventually well in the meantime hey what the fuck ow what happened what was that that was
[14465.75s -> 14473.69s]  ridiculous that hurt all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to
[14473.69s -> 14481.74s]  the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed him he's gonna do it meeting today in the meeting room
[14484.98s -> 14492.04s]  stanley lifted the bucket into his arms and a wave of comfort rushed over him stanley pressed the
[14492.04s -> 14497.56s]  bucket upon every little thing in the office nothing responded to the bucket's touch but it
[14497.56s -> 14513.06s]  did little to discourage stanley's belief in the magic of the bucket let's go he didn't check the
[14513.06s -> 14523.45s]  input i didn't see it stanley clutched the bucket all right so where i didn't go to the left the
[14523.45s -> 14531.18s]  door on his left should i wait i did do the left and i pressed the button should i go right this
[14531.18s -> 14536.60s]  time and go where should i go i'm gonna say yeah i'm gonna say right this was not the correct way
[14536.60s -> 14542.20s]  to the meeting room but stanley had felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee
[14542.20s -> 14551.45s]  lounge was simply the place to be and here it was had the bucket turned out to be correct was
[14551.45s -> 14556.73s]  this better than the meeting room yes stanley thought to himself yes perhaps it truly was
[14556.73s -> 14563.85s]  stupid fucking idiot never mind the bucket was wrong stanley took the door on his left
[14563.85s -> 14575.10s]  to go back to the meeting room i haven't gone up there okay i'm gonna go here no said the bucket
[14575.10s -> 14581.74s]  don't go to the meeting room go somewhere else the cargo lift yes go there go to the cargo lift
[14583.66s -> 14594.33s]  every audio book you've ever listened to in your life good said the bucket now ride the lift all
[14594.33s -> 14599.05s]  the way to the top there's something up there i need you to do i'm going up stanley did not
[14599.05s -> 14603.85s]  question why or how this bucket was speaking to him it should have alarmed him of course because
[14603.85s -> 14609.61s]  buckets can't talk but stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact he was firmly convinced
[14609.61s -> 14614.41s]  that the bucket had spoken to him and he unthinkingly did whatever the bucket asked
[14615.29s -> 14626.22s]  okay in here said the bucket go into this dark room over here stanley once again
[14626.22s -> 14638.14s]  obeyed blindly i love the bucket voice the bucket voice is amazing okay what else do you want to do
[14638.14s -> 14654.18s]  bucket hey now pick up the phone said the bucket pick up the phone and it will take us back home
[14654.18s -> 14663.51s]  where we can go about life together i just again i just see the in the studio with the glasses
[14663.51s -> 14668.95s]  down here like this reading the script i like just see it i love it i just it's just so comfortable
[14668.95s -> 14680.50s]  to me it's so comfortable to me this is the sad story of a man named stanley and his bucket once
[14680.50s -> 14685.22s]  upon a time i gave stanley a bucket because i thought he was lonely and could use a friend
[14685.86s -> 14690.18s]  and then very distressingly he began to believe the bucket could speak to him
[14690.18s -> 14724.12s]  okay my friend take me to work with you okay the stanley parable reassurance bucket was merely
[14724.12s -> 14728.60s]  meant to provide the comforting glow of companionship it doesn't literally talk
[14728.60s -> 14735.56s]  and give you orders whatever stanley is hearing the bucket say to him is just in his head but
[14736.36s -> 14742.42s]  you mean it wasn't talking to me it was just it was you the whole time
[14744.04s -> 14757.30s]  cheap that's fucking cheap take me back home with you okay lately i've been concerned about him
[14757.30s -> 14762.50s]  oh wouldn't you be concerned as well dev twitter see him delusional like this obsessing over an
[14762.50s -> 14767.94s]  inanimate object i want to say something to him but i don't know how i can convince him i don't
[14767.94s -> 14795.06s]  know what's the what's on the dev's twitter oh i've seen this yeah i've seen this all of his
[14795.06s -> 14800.14s]  co-workers were gone
[14803.45s -> 14821.51s]  i've seen it scroll down but okay all of his co-workers yeah everyone was so bad at
[14821.51s -> 14829.94s]  following directions he was incredibly he wasn't fired yeah i've seen it yeah i i saw that video
[14829.94s -> 14841.50s]  it's funny yeah that's from a while ago that's from like like a year ago yeah i've seen it
[14842.14s -> 14853.59s]  that's fun go back to work do i sleep why am i just going back and forth here
[14853.59s -> 14858.95s]  i'm just going back and forth back without like eating or sleeping stanley can you hear me listen
[14858.95s -> 14866.39s]  to me it's just a bucket it can't think it can't talk all it would ever truly do for you is
[14866.39s -> 14872.39s]  effectively transfer a liquid from one location to a different location what a huge deal it doesn't
[14872.39s -> 14881.72s]  do anything else that literally changed the course of all humanity basic tools made us gain
[14881.72s -> 14888.52s]  consciousness essentially like the idea of the bucket of the stone axe of the wheel
[14890.14s -> 14896.68s]  that changed the course of human history don't listen to the loud man press p for us to go back
[14896.68s -> 14904.84s]  home yes let's go you see he's not listening he's still taking orders from the bucket you know once
[14904.84s -> 14910.20s]  upon a time it was me he took orders from me he trusted and listened to not anymore he cares about
[14910.28s -> 14922.12s]  his awful bucket this stupid hunk of metal not anymore ignore anyone in your life except me
[14922.12s -> 14928.94s]  it's sad i suppose he doesn't need me anymore from now on he's just going to cling to this
[14928.94s -> 14936.62s]  bucket this cold empty bucket this sort of shiny bucket well i'll give it this the bucket does
[14936.62s -> 14945.14s]  have a nice shine to it it is very shiny and it makes fun noises too you believe i'm really
[14945.14s -> 14953.67s]  don't you stanley go back home yes i suppose on closer inspection that it doesn't quite look
[14953.67s -> 14959.27s]  like your average hardware store bucket it's just a little more um what am i trying to say
[14959.27s -> 14964.23s]  yeah plus i could put it in my head capable of transporting liquid i can put it over my head
[14964.23s -> 14969.08s]  better at moving an amount of water from one room to another and go like this
[14972.81s -> 14986.04s]  and i didn't think it was funny relive the same day with me over and over and over again okay
[14987.26s -> 14994.49s]  oh my am i saying better at carrying water from room to room it's a bucket it's literally just a
[14994.49s -> 15000.49s]  bucket why do i feel some need to point out the ways in which it's so much more than just a
[15000.49s -> 15010.09s]  regular bucket because it is a coin it's just a coin which it is you know that line that i've just
[15010.09s -> 15019.54s]  watched but you know what i mean i'm having feelings for the bucket no no no no no what's
[15019.54s -> 15025.06s]  going on why do i want to be with the bucket hear what the bucket has to say do anything it asks
[15025.06s -> 15030.74s]  what the fuck i don't understand perhaps perhaps if i had the bucket this would be less confusing
[15030.74s -> 15037.30s]  yes the bucket could tell me what to do in this troublesome situation now this is my ring i have
[15037.30s -> 15046.44s]  the one bucket to rule us all not you it's mine mine stanley give me the bucket no to me give me
[15046.44s -> 15066.79s]  now it's my bucket i need it no to me now no or i'll go back to work stanley it better not be
[15066.79s -> 15072.71s]  gone or i'm gonna be really pissed off i'm gonna be very co-workers were gone where is it what could
[15072.71s -> 15079.11s]  it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo no matter how
[15079.11s -> 15092.47s]  hard stanley looked he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers where is it thank goodness
[15092.47s -> 15100.31s]  the confusion and the chaos all seemed to melt away as stanley embraced the bucket thank goodness
[15101.83s -> 15108.22s]  input input input i i didn't see a computer i looked at the computers i didn't see one with
[15108.22s -> 15129.86s]  an input on it look i didn't see one how do i get it oh go to the phone again go do another phone
[15129.86s -> 15141.21s]  ending stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his this was not the correct way to the meeting room
[15141.21s -> 15146.73s]  but stanley had felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge was simply
[15146.73s -> 15154.42s]  the place to be and here it was had the bucket turned out to be correct was this better than
[15154.42s -> 15161.24s]  the meeting room no never mind the bucket was wrong stanley took the door on his left
[15161.24s -> 15168.70s]  to go back to the meeting room no he didn't no said the bucket don't go to the meeting room
[15168.78s -> 15175.34s]  mr bucket somewhere else a cargo lift yes good at the top of my mouth mr bucket all the way to
[15175.34s -> 15179.42s]  the top of my mouth there's something up there i need you to do we're all gonna run mr bucket
[15179.42s -> 15184.22s]  not question why or how it's a fun was speaking to him it should have alarmed him of course we
[15184.22s -> 15190.22s]  come off the left no but stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact he was firmly convinced
[15190.22s -> 15197.98s]  that the bucket had spoken to him and he unthinkingly did whatever the bucket asked but stanley
[15197.98s -> 15202.78s]  feared that any path he walked might lead to the separation of himself and the bucket
[15202.78s -> 15208.62s]  his dearest friend so he threw himself to his death that they might die in one another's arms
[15209.35s -> 15218.01s]  how deeply touching i'm gonna do the phone i'm gonna go to the phone i'm gonna go to the phone
[15218.65s -> 15223.13s]  i'm gonna go to the phone i decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simple memo
[15223.13s -> 15230.23s]  warmth spread through stanley's arms with the bucket in his arms again he was home i'm gonna go
[15230.71s -> 15235.11s]  clutch the bucket tightly to his chin this was not the correct way to the meeting room
[15235.11s -> 15240.63s]  but stanley had felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge was simply
[15240.63s -> 15246.31s]  the place to be and here it was had the bucket turned out to be correct he did the phone with
[15246.31s -> 15252.23s]  the bucket already the bucket was wrong did i stanley took the door on his left to go back
[15252.23s -> 15257.99s]  to the meeting was something else i could do with the phone no said the bucket don't go to the
[15258.07s -> 15263.27s]  meeting room go somewhere else the cargo lift yes well what about yeah what about this one
[15263.27s -> 15268.39s]  go and unplug now ride the lift all the way to the top there's something up there i need you to do
[15269.27s -> 15273.91s]  stanley did not question why or how this bucket was speaking it should have alarmed
[15273.91s -> 15279.27s]  it was because buckets can't talk what stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact
[15279.27s -> 15284.47s]  i'll go back firmly convinced that the bucket had spoken to him and he unthinkingly did whatever
[15284.47s -> 15293.54s]  the bucket asked okay we'll do that next in here said the bucket go into this dark room over here
[15294.26s -> 15301.35s]  stanley once again obeyed blindly okay phone phone rings don't answer the phone instead
[15301.35s -> 15307.03s]  now pick up the phone said the bucket pick up the phone and it will take us back home where we can
[15307.03s -> 15314.15s]  go about oh hold on why did you unplug the phone i felt like it were you trying to resist the
[15314.15s -> 15320.15s]  bucket's orders stanley i was joking obviously the bucket isn't talking to you and telling you to
[15320.15s -> 15326.15s]  do things buckets can't talk it was a joke don't you get the joke it's funny stanley a talking
[15326.15s -> 15331.43s]  bucket the bucket was talking can't you see oh goodness i must have really bungled up the
[15331.43s -> 15335.43s]  delivery if you actually took me seriously the bucket had a different voice than you
[15335.99s -> 15343.11s]  paused for longer or spoken quicker oh comedic timing is so difficult i wish i were better at it
[15343.11s -> 15347.91s]  but there isn't exactly an instructional video on comedy that one can watch to fully
[15347.91s -> 15357.53s]  oh wait yes there is um it's sitting right here why let's take a look what is what is comedic timing
[15358.25s -> 15366.65s]  what is comedic timing how does it work how long should it last how can it be used to effectively
[15366.65s -> 15373.05s]  silence your political enemies and more importantly can it be taught in its entirety within 90 seconds
[15373.05s -> 15379.13s]  so it takes decades thankfully the answer to all of these questions decades yes craft let's dive
[15379.13s -> 15385.88s]  deeper if you've ever told a joke or made someone laugh in all likelihood you did it while standing
[15385.88s -> 15392.36s]  50 to 80 centimeters from them in a room of no more than 76 degrees fahrenheit with one of your
[15392.36s -> 15399.16s]  arms raised straight upward at a 15 degree angle from your body these are the optimal conditions
[15399.24s -> 15404.68s]  for good comedic timing to begin the joke start by stating and spelling your name
[15405.40s -> 15410.44s]  next provide a brief synopsis of the joke including the specific times at which the
[15410.44s -> 15417.00s]  recipient of the joke will laugh and then spell out your name a second time with these steps
[15417.00s -> 15424.20s]  complete it's time to begin the humor speak the entire joke in no more than 18 seconds
[15424.20s -> 15429.16s]  and no less than 13 and a half pausing only for bathroom breaks when necessary
[15430.04s -> 15435.00s]  when the joke has concluded it is customary to inform your listener that the joke is over
[15435.00s -> 15442.76s]  by declaring in your loudest possible voice i'm dunny with the funny let's practice screaming
[15442.76s -> 15452.50s]  i'm dunny with the funny now i'm not gonna do that good this saying is a perfect example
[15452.50s -> 15458.26s]  of expectation management that was the cornerstone of good comedy wasn't it finally
[15458.26s -> 15463.22s]  it's time to hand out surveys collecting hard data from your audience on how
[15463.22s -> 15467.86s]  wrapped they were throughout the joke is the only way to grow with minus twos and plus twos
[15467.86s -> 15473.14s]  an effective survey should be no less than 10 pages long and should include the same question
[15473.14s -> 15478.34s]  reprinted several times just to ensure the survey taker is actually paying attention
[15478.34s -> 15483.54s]  and not simply filling in answers at random and that's all there is with these strategies
[15483.54s -> 15489.62s]  at your disposal you'll have audiences doubled over in laughter and even tripled over in laughter
[15489.62s -> 15495.62s]  scary scary just remember to let them stop laughing at some point you gut-busting little
[15495.62s -> 15501.30s]  scamp after all with each of us needed on the front lines of the war to fight the 12-legged
[15501.94s -> 15507.94s]  who's very existence and a very lucky die in a hailstorm of bullets and mandibles
[15507.94s -> 15512.98s]  all of us must be prepared to give our lives to this noble cause just as our children must
[15512.98s -> 15519.14s]  do after us and their children after them godspeed and may earth reign supreme
[15523.14s -> 15528.02s]  jesus hey goodness this video is a little outdated isn't it well no matter i think
[15528.02s -> 15533.22s]  the fundamentals of proper comedic timing are still as relevant today as they were back then
[15533.22s -> 15538.74s]  so with that in mind i believe the only way forward is for us to return to the two doors
[15538.74s -> 15544.58s]  and walk through all of this again so i can try telling my story with more appropriate comedic
[15544.58s -> 15554.55s]  delivery come along does it change i hope it does that'd be funny if it changed does he start
[15554.55s -> 15573.03s]  talking in like a funny voice talking a funny voice please i can feel it this time i'm really
[15573.03s -> 15579.03s]  going to nail the delivery you'll be in stitches a talking bucket you'll say how ridiculous how
[15579.03s -> 15585.83s]  absurd what a hilarious concept the king of comedy that's what y'all call me thank goodness
[15585.83s -> 15591.67s]  we have the instructional video otherwise who knows where we'd be right now i'm gonna eat with
[15591.67s -> 15601.42s]  the funny comedy that's for sure the bucket spoke to stanley the bucket spoke the bucket spoke oh
[15601.42s -> 15605.34s]  i'll figure it out on the fly i think a little higher to think things i think a little bit higher
[15605.82s -> 15609.83s]  you actually nailed it with the with the higher kind of more nasally approach i think that was
[15609.83s -> 15614.98s]  actually funny because a bucket i'd add an echo to your voice too just a slight one just like a
[15614.98s -> 15624.17s]  little small one like this and talk kind of with a higher voice and maybe have like sort of a new
[15624.17s -> 15629.29s]  york accent i think that might be kind of fucking funny too a new york accent and a kind of a high
[15629.29s -> 15639.54s]  echoey voice i think would nail it and be crass too be crass say some swears it's a bucket it
[15639.54s -> 15646.10s]  sees like paint and and slop and dirt it would be a little crass be crass go fun with it have fun
[15646.10s -> 15682.60s]  with it is the joke over yet i'm not conforming to that here we go you ready when stanley and the
[15682.60s -> 15693.85s]  bucket came to a set of two open doors they entered the door on the left no no no no no you
[15693.85s -> 15697.93s]  were supposed to go through the door on the right what leading back to the phone what the fuck i
[15697.93s -> 15703.29s]  don't even look at the instructional video i think this is all covered very no but i no way i can
[15703.29s -> 15709.93s]  make the comedic timing work now it's done what is completely down and over it's all your fault
[15709.93s -> 15715.61s]  stanley i'm going to be ridiculed in the community of other joke writers i'm going to be shamed at
[15715.61s -> 15720.89s]  every one of our meetings from now on all because you couldn't watch a simple video and take a hint
[15720.89s -> 15727.02s]  are you proud of yourself for bringing me down stanley are you proud what the hell happened
[15729.02s -> 15733.90s]  when stanley and the bucket came to a set of two open doors they entered the door on the left
[15734.70s -> 15746.71s]  there you go all right let's see it well we're back at the phone already no no no what's going
[15746.71s -> 15751.27s]  on there were supposed to be several rooms leading up to it's called improv figure it out to be a
[15751.27s -> 15756.07s]  build-up to this point a dramatic display of remarkable comedic wit which you got to be
[15756.07s -> 15761.75s]  ready for anything scene with the phone but now the timing's completely off the joke will never
[15761.75s -> 15767.35s]  land well not the way it was meant to and it's all my fault i must have forgotten that the phone room
[15767.35s -> 15774.23s]  comes immediately after the two doors room what an egregious mistake i'd made a fool of myself
[15774.23s -> 15779.91s]  i don't deserve the title of king of comedy i'm nothing i'm not even the lowliest joke telling
[15779.91s -> 15787.74s]  well well i think i need to go back and re-watch that instructional video again
[15788.78s -> 15797.75s]  yes surely that will help me improve my stanley you love the bucket so much it's like you
[15798.71s -> 15806.55s]  it's as though all of your other dispositions pale in comparison yes let me try that again
[15806.55s -> 15818.68s]  stanley i heard that you are in love with a bucket you are where the hell am i is it the delivery
[15818.68s -> 15826.95s]  pale with shame pale with shame pale what's another word to describe a bucket stanley this
[15826.95s -> 15833.99s]  bucket is so mental i think i saw it playing guitar no no no you don't need to tell a joke
[15843.67s -> 15862.94s]  you don't gotta tell a joke yeah that's unfortunate unfortunate so i never got the
[15862.94s -> 15867.58s]  normal ending somebody said that's the normal ending workers were gone i got the bucket normal
[15867.58s -> 15885.48s]  ending decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo damn it stanley picked
[15885.48s -> 15891.56s]  up the bucket and smiled he'd never be alone again not truly alone not with the bucket around
[15906.07s -> 15917.24s]  fucking come on stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest all right where are we going
[15917.24s -> 15927.67s]  entered the door on his left so i did the right i didn't do i want to go left oh the collectible
[15928.47s -> 15941.51s]  shoot i'll get it after i'll get it after how can we find them trust the completionist instinct you
[15941.51s -> 15947.03s]  must find them it will be a reward for finding them all well floating objects have appeared across
[15947.03s -> 15951.99s]  the office we have to synergize our resources to ensure their retrieval there are many questions
[15951.99s -> 15956.15s]  let me tell you spotted one what makes them float in the air who took these pictures of them
[15958.06s -> 15975.10s]  follow clues provided by employee 416 we can do it red room i got the hiccups good luck all right
[15975.10s -> 15986.38s]  i gotta go to the red room large ooh a large room lots of boxes stairs something to do with stairs
[15986.38s -> 16003.82s]  somewhere both red and blue no i know where those are stanley we must move on from this broom closet
[16003.82s -> 16010.22s]  simply because i have no remaining stickers if i did you can guarantee we'd be in here for hours
[16010.22s -> 16023.99s]  but alas no stickers coming to a staircase stanley on the bucket walked upstairs to the
[16023.99s -> 16046.82s]  boss's office up or down i think i did it up already and now i'm torn between stan lorine's
[16047.78s -> 16052.98s]  what do you think stanley what name better encapsulates the intrinsic sense of happiness
[16052.98s -> 16057.30s]  that you get from seeing a small number i need two more that's it screen go up by one
[16057.30s -> 16068.92s]  let me sit on it i'm sure it will come to me wait this is the floating ending he considered the
[16068.92s -> 16074.28s]  possibility of facing his boss admitting he had left his post during work hours he might be found
[16074.28s -> 16079.08s]  for that do i get a different bucket ending competitive economy why had he taken that risk
[16079.08s -> 16084.28s]  all because he believed everyone had vanished his boss would think he was crazy and then
[16084.84s -> 16090.76s]  something occurred to stanley i have my bucket maybe he thought to himself maybe i am crazy
[16091.32s -> 16097.88s]  he looked down i still die am i crazy he asked the bucket the bucket returned his gaze but said
[16097.88s -> 16103.08s]  nothing at all that's strange stanley thought usually the bucket is a source of guidance and
[16103.08s -> 16109.30s]  wisdom for me in difficult times such as these he held the bucket close yet felt none of its
[16109.30s -> 16115.70s]  familiar reassurance and comfort and that's when stanley realized floating this isn't my bucket
[16115.70s -> 16122.26s]  it's just a normal everyday bucket someone else's bucket perhaps how i end up with someone else's
[16122.26s -> 16126.50s]  bucket this is all terribly wrong i got the stickers on it good would come from this hey who
[16126.50s -> 16131.38s]  knows what sorts of bizarre hallucinations stanley might experience without the psychologically
[16131.38s -> 16136.18s]  grounding presence of his bucket why did it go away indeed now he noticed that the rooms were
[16136.18s -> 16141.86s]  repeating which was of course very odd and now he felt himself floating off the ground what the
[16141.86s -> 16148.98s]  hell oh gracious what the hell without my bucket i've gone truly mad where is it i must find it
[16148.98s -> 16157.38s]  far off in the distance now he heard it calling to him stanley stanley it's me the bucket where are
[16157.38s -> 16162.18s]  you could it truly be he rushed forward from room to room passing by one bucket after the next
[16162.18s -> 16168.82s]  oh shit none of them were his none of them were his special bucket why come to me stanley find me
[16169.70s -> 16174.18s]  he had to find the bucket he had to return to his old where's my bucket was the only way to truly
[16174.18s -> 16180.02s]  restore his sanity and then suddenly he froze dead in his tracks he knew where the voice of
[16180.02s -> 16187.62s]  the bucket had been coming from the real bucket was inside of him all along it was incredibly
[16187.62s -> 16200.71s]  painful stanley doubled over in agony and blacked out wait this is the story of a woman i still die
[16201.86s -> 16207.83s]  i actually still die mariella woke up on a day like any other the bucket in the scene rose
[16208.95s -> 16212.79s]  picked up her bucket of comfort and security and walked to her place of work
[16213.75s -> 16217.99s]  but on this particular day her walk was interrupted by the body of a man
[16217.99s -> 16222.31s]  who had stumbled through town talking and screaming to himself and then collapsed
[16222.31s -> 16228.15s]  dead on the sidewalk right away she knew what the problem he didn't have a bucket this man
[16228.15s -> 16234.39s]  had no bucket right of course he'd gone mad ranting and raving about a narrator describing
[16234.39s -> 16238.87s]  all of his actions and how everything is predetermined and free will is an illusion
[16238.87s -> 16244.79s]  and it's all just a video game it could all have been prevented if only he'd taken his bucket with
[16244.79s -> 16251.11s]  him perhaps he didn't even realize he'd forgotten his bucket at home in the first place how cruel
[16251.11s -> 16257.51s]  the world can be mariella thought and she hugged her own bucket even tighter but of course she had
[16257.51s -> 16263.67s]  no time for this there were a myriad of confusing problems she would soon have to confront at work
[16263.67s -> 16268.23s]  for which her bucket would provide absolute guidance and total clarity on everything
[16268.23s -> 16274.39s]  heck yes she thought to herself my life kicks ass and she backflipped all the way to work
[16274.95s -> 16309.00s]  what am i doing i take this fucking thing everywhere everywhere i take it to work all
[16309.00s -> 16313.40s]  of his co-workers i take it to the store what could it mean i constantly have it decided right
[16313.40s -> 16320.02s]  here meeting room perhaps he had simply i take it everywhere somebody got my mouth and it was
[16320.02s -> 16323.30s]  not even that bad because it's not even a big deal it's just like fucking whatever it is
[16323.30s -> 16338.63s]  what is chapstick made out of helanthus anus sunflower seed oil coconut oil beeswax castor
[16338.63s -> 16353.05s]  seed oil aroma shea butter cocoa butter strawberry seed oil some kind of soybean
[16353.85s -> 16369.93s]  glycerin or something oil geraniol and natural flavor now this is content thank you what was that
[16369.93s -> 16382.84s]  oh okay now i'm gonna go get the one that's in the big room the big room then i'll need one more
[16382.84s -> 16388.12s]  after that when stanley came to a set of two open doors he had this was not the correct way to the
[16388.12s -> 16392.68s]  meeting room and stanley knew it perfectly well perhaps he wanted to stop where's my bucket where's
[16392.68s -> 16400.28s]  my bucket i don't have my bucket anymore just to admire it where's my bucket was okay i missed i
[16400.28s -> 16404.44s]  didn't take i didn't pick the bucket up but i fucked it all up to get back to business stanley
[16404.44s -> 16411.61s]  took the first open door on his left no idea i'm gonna get up here i'll jump off stanley was so bad
[16411.61s -> 16425.99s]  at following directions it's incredible he wasn't five years ago you're getting one more now stanley
[16425.99s -> 16432.07s]  you've nearly gotten all of the figler and marines very soon you'll collect the last one and then the
[16432.07s -> 16438.31s]  first number will equal the second number and that will be it will be different people by then
[16438.31s -> 16443.75s]  different in the sense that we used to have none of them looks why he looks so sad we have them all
[16443.75s -> 16452.60s]  you can't go back to when you had no figler and marines none of us can but in his eagerness to
[16452.60s -> 16457.96s]  prove that he is in control of the story and no one gets to tell him what to do stanley left from
[16457.96s -> 16463.80s]  the platform and plunged to his death all right good job stanley everyone thinks you are very
[16463.80s -> 16473.24s]  powerful my bucket all of his co-workers were gone where's this last one stanley decided to go
[16473.24s -> 16479.48s]  to the meeting room perhaps he had simply the good old bucket just stanley and the bucket off on
[16479.48s -> 16487.94s]  another thrilling adventure together stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest
[16487.94s -> 16493.54s]  and entered the door on his left no this was not the correct way to the meeting room
[16493.54s -> 16499.06s]  nope stanley had felt the bucket calling to him telling him that the employee lounge was simply
[16499.06s -> 16506.73s]  the place to be and here it was had the bucket turned out to be correct was it no never mind
[16506.81s -> 16511.37s]  the bucket was wrong no the bucket wasn't wrong the door on his left we're going the right way
[16511.37s -> 16518.23s]  to the meeting room because i'm doing this now said the bucket don't go to the meeting room
[16518.23s -> 16542.82s]  go somewhere else the cargo lift yes go there go to the cargo lift okay what's down here
[16545.38s -> 16567.30s]  cassette tapes oh narrator dialogue narrator dialogue oh we're gonna meet the narrator this
[16567.30s -> 16580.42s]  is day number 295 take number i don't even know lost track nothing feels real anymore
[16580.42s -> 16587.24s]  wait is this supposed to be the narrator when he was young i study this bucket less sense
[16588.28s -> 16599.08s]  anything makes this is me talking sheer euphoria i feel every time i pick it up this is dark souls
[16599.08s -> 16609.21s]  dialogue no matter how many times i've done it it's always the same feeling and the emptiness
[16609.21s -> 16623.03s]  in my chest when i set it down doesn't make sense there's no explanation for it i still
[16623.75s -> 16631.51s]  haven't figured out why i see the world so differently when this bucket is in my arms
[16632.47s -> 16652.06s]  why everything feels so what do i do with this treasure i can i can monetize it it's unthinkable
[16652.06s -> 16663.16s]  the amounts of money people will pay for just an hour with the bucket this is my golden ticket
[16663.88s -> 16669.72s]  but i have to be careful because as soon as this gets out there's going to be a target on my back
[16670.92s -> 16678.44s]  even now i don't know who might be trying to get what's that who's there
[16690.65s -> 16709.46s]  blast harry potter you just ruined the moment i have to hear it i keep fucking thinking about it
[16710.02s -> 16717.18s]  i can't stop thinking about it dude i really fucking can't i promise i can't stop thinking
[16717.18s -> 16774.78s]  about this okay we're good i just need to hear it every like four or five days i just need to
[16774.78s -> 16790.46s]  hear it every four or five days that's it what happened this is different all of his
[16790.46s -> 16796.06s]  co-workers were gone what could it mean what how i decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he
[16796.06s -> 16803.67s]  had simply missed a memo where are we going today the bucket asked stanley just smile anywhere they
[16803.67s -> 16808.23s]  went together would be stanley pressed the bucket upon every little thing in the office
[16808.95s -> 16813.75s]  yay responded to the bucket's touch but it did little to discourage stanley's belief
[16813.75s -> 16835.54s]  in the magic of the bucket the whiteboard ending dog mode let me tell you about the
[16837.16s -> 16844.14s]  dog sound like christmas album where it's like the jingle bells and shit they don't sell them
[16844.22s -> 16853.26s]  anymore they don't make them anymore they don't make it anymore
[16872.89s -> 16879.78s]  i used to fucking cry laughing at that shit it was so stupid we wish you a merry christmas
[16879.86s -> 16884.22s]  barking dog christmas song wait you found it already do they still exist
[16899.35s -> 16933.78s]  okay what is this this is jingle bells i'm serious if you want to win a you laugh you
[16933.78s -> 16942.39s]  lose challenge or like a no emotion challenge play this for somebody and they're gonna be like
[16942.39s -> 16981.58s]  just what the fuck man like it's too much it's just stupid i'll try i'll try it that one's not
[16981.58s -> 16995.16s]  even funny the dogs aren't even there anymore wait what
[17008.15s -> 17030.44s]  where do they go they're not here okay there they are okay listen to the cat ones
[17030.44s -> 17071.35s]  so all right this is the last one and i'm done i would i would fucking
[17073.35s -> 17083.38s]  i want to like put this up i want to go like big christmas party and just put this on
[17083.38s -> 17088.71s]  it's just it's it's just so different it's just so odd that people would be like sitting there
[17088.71s -> 17092.39s]  drinking the drinks and like it's not the typical just shit that's on the radio it'd be like
[17092.39s -> 17100.18s]  what the fuck is this like what this is kind of weird no it's a 10 hour version guys i'm not
[17100.18s -> 17118.63s]  gonna let it play the whole time we lost like 300 viewers amateurs let's go they clutched the
[17118.63s -> 17123.67s]  bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left all right so what was i gonna do
[17124.31s -> 17138.82s]  it was more like 4 000 oops all right we need to go left and then we need to go
[17139.85s -> 17148.28s]  somewhere else i want to find that oh that just scared the shit out of me
[17148.92s -> 17164.49s]  okay somewhere both red and blue coming to a staircase standy on the bucket walked upstairs
[17165.13s -> 17176.25s]  his office okay i'm gonna go up no no where do i go up no where should i go from here it is up
[17176.25s -> 17193.80s]  isn't it i need a red and blue door because the boss knows that what the boss says goes if the
[17193.80s -> 17208.50s]  boss has suffered losses then that's what the boss chose oh shut the fuck up stepping into his
[17208.50s -> 17214.74s]  manager's office stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life
[17214.74s -> 17219.54s]  two what is it two eight of this revelation stanley may have broken down into an emotional
[17219.54s -> 17227.06s]  four five but stanley gets the correct code by sheer luck was it that the bucket knew all along
[17227.06s -> 17233.14s]  was the bucket guiding him no it was the dog yes right dog certainly the most logical explanation
[17233.14s -> 17236.90s]  right dog you have the floor whatever you'd like to say about what just happened
[17238.04s -> 17255.24s]  oh hey hey hey hey what the fuck what the fuck dude i gave you the fucking floor and
[17255.96s -> 17277.11s]  jesus that was actually fucked i'm not letting the dog talk again just fucked up fuck man stanley
[17277.11s -> 17282.95s]  and the bucket walked straight ahead through the large door that read mind control facility oh can
[17282.95s -> 17291.16s]  i do i can do this one right i haven't done this one with a bucket this passageway had the word
[17291.16s -> 17296.44s]  escape written on it the truth was that at the end of this hall stanley and the bucket would
[17296.44s -> 17301.48s]  both meet a violent death i got where do what do i find the red and the blue door next to each other
[17301.48s -> 17306.52s]  right the door behind them was not shut stanley and the bucket still had every opportunity to
[17306.52s -> 17315.27s]  turn around and get back on track at this point stanley and the bucket were knowingly walking
[17315.27s -> 17342.74s]  forward into a very painful death for each of them so now what happens if i have the bucket
[17343.38s -> 17353.27s]  we're gonna do infomercials tonight plan is to do infomercials tomorrow as the machine word into
[17353.27s -> 17358.55s]  motion and stanley and the bucket inch closer to their demise stanley reflected on how meaningless
[17358.55s -> 17364.63s]  the bucket's warmth and comfort had turned out to be to be sure it puts the mind and the soul i stop
[17364.63s -> 17369.19s]  it with the bucket embrace the bucket but what use is a sense of ease when you're about to be crushed
[17369.19s -> 17374.71s]  to death this is what stanley thought to himself and he sort of kicked himself for wasting so much
[17374.71s -> 17387.11s]  time carrying a bucket everywhere farewell stanley farewell stanley cried the narrator who is this
[17387.11s -> 17393.75s]  person why they and the bucket were led helplessly into the enormous metal jaws in a single visceral
[17393.75s -> 17410.74s]  instant the bucket's life came to an end as it was crushed violently to death it was a shame the
[17410.74s -> 17416.58s]  death of such a magnificent bucket it's true that all buckets are radiant in their own way
[17416.58s -> 17428.89s]  but this one stood above the rest it was a glorious bucket to behold what the fuck the bucket
[17430.81s -> 17447.14s]  welcomes you to the grand exhibit okay this is different can you see how arrogant it was for
[17447.14s -> 17453.54s]  stanley to take a bucket like this and to claim it for his own can you see the hubris that blinded
[17453.54s -> 17460.18s]  him can you see that the bucket is far more noble than stanley will ever be in his short life
[17466.44s -> 17477.74s]  um all right bucket with two handles this bucket is depicted as having two handles such a design
[17477.74s -> 17482.70s]  has never been created in real life haven't been deemed too dangerous and recklessly experimental
[17483.75s -> 17497.30s]  every year dozens are put to death just for attempting it word the inferno bucket replica
[17497.38s -> 17501.94s]  of the inferno bucket which in the medieval era was so powerfully alluring that it drove dozens
[17501.94s -> 17506.90s]  of nations to war with one another for control of it billions died and yet in spite of it all the
[17506.90s -> 17527.19s]  simple fact remains no one can control a bucket what the cave drawing while we know that buckets
[17527.19s -> 17533.19s]  predate the existence of mankind we do not know by how long this cave drawing depicts early men's
[17533.19s -> 17536.95s]  discovery of the practical uses of the bucket by which time the bucket had already likely been
[17536.95s -> 17542.39s]  around for several millennia notice in these drawings how the bucket is allowing itself to be
[17542.39s -> 17556.94s]  used having judged humanity to be worthy of its treasures no man can own a bucket and certainly
[17556.94s -> 17563.34s]  not a bucket as dazzling to behold as this one it is man who should kneel before the bucket
[17567.45s -> 17572.01s]  the hanging bucket this piece symbolizes the necessary relationship between bucket and
[17572.01s -> 17577.45s]  humanity however clear our grasp of the bucket may be there is yet more that is always out of reach
[17578.17s -> 17594.20s]  this distance inevitably is for our own good i got it but there is something we can do something
[17594.20s -> 17604.33s]  we can do together you and i that will right this terrible wrong let stanley die let him be crushed
[17604.33s -> 17609.85s]  by the machine don't reset the game don't give him another opportunity to run off with another
[17609.85s -> 17614.57s]  beautiful bucket we can save the world's buckets from their treatment as tools and implements if
[17614.57s -> 17620.49s]  only we let stanley die together the bucket shall take its place as ruler as leader as commander of
[17620.49s -> 17644.86s]  a new world a new vision i can't wait to tell this story to my co-workers stanley thought
[17644.86s -> 17650.14s]  how amusing they'll find it oh won't we all just laugh and laugh at the time i thought everyone had
[17650.14s -> 17656.30s]  gone missing no matter how hard stanley looked he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers
[17657.18s -> 17676.94s]  when stanley came to a set of all right i want to get that last one he entered the door on his left
[17676.94s -> 17681.10s]  i want to get the last um this was not the correct way to the meeting room and stanley knew it
[17681.10s -> 17686.22s]  perfectly well it's this way wanted to stop and then on the catwalk right lounge first just to admire
[17686.22s -> 17693.53s]  it it was okay i think it's yeah i gotta go as if we get the two doors to get back to business
[17693.53s -> 17697.69s]  stanley took the first open door on his am i gonna get the true ending if i get all the
[17697.69s -> 17704.41s]  bobblehead things stanley was so bad at following directions it's incredible he wasn't fired years
[17704.41s -> 17711.24s]  ago look stanley i think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here what about the bucket i'm
[17711.24s -> 17716.52s]  not sure i don't want it really i'm not i realize that investing your trust in someone else can be
[17716.52s -> 17723.64s]  difficult but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you all this time there's someone
[17723.64s -> 17730.12s]  you've been neglecting stanley someone you forgot one really wait what was in the middle of something
[17730.12s -> 17735.24s]  do you have zero consideration for others are you that convinced that i want something bad to
[17735.24s -> 17741.16s]  happen to you okay i don't know how to convince you of this but i really do want to help you
[17741.16s -> 17747.40s]  to show you something beautiful okay let me prove it let me prove that i'm on your side
[17747.40s -> 17755.26s]  give me a chance my eye okay so both red and blue stanley walked through the red door
[17755.26s -> 17762.54s]  and got them all the last stiggly wiggly savor this moment stanley this is a real accomplishment
[17762.54s -> 17768.06s]  this is doing something just for the sake of doing it where so many people expect to be rewarded for
[17768.06s -> 17775.26s]  the most trivial achievements you've insisted that a job well done is its own reward i would
[17775.26s -> 17780.06s]  tell you that i'm proud of you for collecting them all but that would be like a reward and we
[17780.06s -> 17786.30s]  can't have that so instead i'll just say it's done we're all done here and now we can go to
[17786.30s -> 17798.36s]  whatever the hell you were doing before you hunted for figurines okay let's go on the blue door i just
[17798.36s -> 17808.09s]  have to go to perhaps you misunderstood stanley walked through the red door red oh thank god you
[17808.09s -> 17813.69s]  are willing to listen to me do you see that i really have wanted you to be happy all this time
[17813.69s -> 17819.21s]  the problem is all these choices the two of us always trying to get some reset just begin the
[17819.21s -> 17837.58s]  game again just reset do i win did i win should i go back to the stanley parable 2 area is that a
[17837.58s -> 17850.39s]  better idea stanley i'm sorry but i have to put a pause on things it's just it's those figurines
[17850.39s -> 17856.47s]  those figs i haven't stopped thinking about them since you nabbed every last one wasn't it just
[17856.47s -> 17861.83s]  the most intrinsically fulfilling moment of your entire life didn't it fill you to the brim with
[17861.83s -> 17866.63s]  their inner richness yes i know we're supposed to be telling a story who's up there but won't you
[17866.63s -> 17872.15s]  please indulge me with one more trip back to the memory zone okay i would love nothing more than
[17872.15s -> 17882.10s]  to revisit the figurines just one more time i wish there was a burp mode where i could be like
[17882.10s -> 17918.79s]  now remembering when stanley found the collectibles okay remember this 2013 stanley
[17918.79s -> 17929.30s]  parable stanley parable stanley parable is an exploration story games his choice what does
[17929.30s -> 17944.84s]  it say audience award stanley parable all right i've already seen this wait here's where it all
[17944.84s -> 17951.72s]  began the first collectible oh right no idea of how many of them we'd find sure it's at six right
[17951.72s -> 17957.64s]  there on the screen but how could we know for certain we were so innocent we'll never be like
[17957.64s -> 17989.19s]  that again stanley are there any more this one right here wait it was definitely a trick it was
[17989.19s -> 17995.67s]  a trick and here was the second stan lorraine you found this one all on your own just by poking
[17995.67s -> 18002.07s]  around in the boss's bathroom you did that stanley i'll be honest back then i had no faith in you to
[18002.07s -> 18008.07s]  find any of them let alone six but you continue to surprise me in all sorts of mundane
[18008.07s -> 18020.26s]  unremarkable ways seven am i actually did i just like get am i screwed can i go back through them
[18023.90s -> 18030.86s]  okay let's do a little quiz which of these rooms was the room you found your third mini stan can
[18030.86s -> 18039.70s]  you remember i think it was under the stairs it was under the stairs you're fine you don't need to
[18039.70s -> 18046.06s]  okay it was under the stairs yeah it was i mean no yeah it was it was under the stairs that was
[18046.06s -> 18063.85s]  the fourth one are you sure was it the office don't lie to me is it wrong hey that's exactly
[18063.85s -> 18070.33s]  right it was here behind the boss's office it was the third one you picked it up and then after that
[18070.33s -> 18075.85s]  you had three of them i'm glad these moments are so crystal clear in your memory but i shouldn't be
[18075.85s -> 18081.77s]  surprised after all science tells us that it's impossible to forget your third time doing anything
[18084.09s -> 18096.47s]  okay you gone let's see what came next oh yes we found a figly in this pink room
[18096.47s -> 18101.43s]  oh well i can't actually say i remember being in this room but it's here in the memory zone
[18101.43s -> 18109.00s]  so it must have happened okay definitely wasn't here unless this is somewhere else
[18115.54s -> 18132.18s]  any of the doors open no what's this this was the fifth mini stan oh yeah was really something
[18132.18s -> 18138.26s]  special it was in the warehouse i remember it so clearly in fact because this one is
[18138.26s -> 18143.94s]  particularly special to me i made a little down there to commemorate the occasion enjoy
[18148.17s -> 18177.38s]  windows movie maker you found it near the cargo lift
[18190.90s -> 18196.26s]  ah takes you back doesn't it i've heard to be like time making 2000 but it was eight minutes
[18196.26s -> 18202.97s]  i wouldn't have spent on anything else okay i can go down there can i make it
[18203.61s -> 18213.03s]  there's a wait i can go down there is it will i die if i fall here i can go through look dog b
[18213.59s -> 18223.03s]  well like 2006 yeah i think i'm dead if i do that looks like i can go i can go over there though
[18230.34s -> 18236.94s]  back here again and then stanley then we came to the last collectible the final figurine
[18236.94s -> 18242.46s]  right here by the red and blue doors this memory is the most distinct and clear in my mind perhaps
[18242.46s -> 18248.78s]  because it was the one that happened more recently than all the others who can truly say how the mind
[18248.78s -> 18253.98s]  works all i know is that this is the moment where you picked up a figly and i thought to myself
[18254.06s -> 18261.90s]  yes that's all of them they're all collected it was a moment unlike any other except for the
[18261.90s -> 18276.47s]  other moments picking up figurines which it was exactly like what are you doing i'm being a bird
[18278.46s -> 18296.10s]  uh does it matter which one i go in you are in the present and then there was no more because
[18296.10s -> 18302.66s]  we've caught up to the present moment nothing left to do but move onward into the future goodbye
[18302.66s -> 18313.86s]  memory zone hey lbl just checking no no no i'm not done i'm not ready to move on stop the
[18313.86s -> 18318.90s]  loading screen isn't there some way we can stay here keep enjoying these figurines let's just
[18318.90s -> 18324.26s]  go backwards we'll do the memory zone again from the opposite direction no i don't feel
[18324.26s -> 18330.94s]  oh my god okay can i like turn the tv off or something unplug it i have to go through and do
[18331.02s -> 18341.78s]  all that again backwards oh god okay whatever came through here it's right around the left
[18341.78s -> 18347.94s]  there's the first one the room with the red and blue doors i remember this i must say of all the
[18347.94s -> 18353.54s]  figurines we looked at in our initial tour of the memory zone this one is the most distinct and
[18353.54s -> 18366.49s]  clear in my mind let's keep going i want more weirdo and here's where i made that video don't
[18366.49s -> 18376.23s]  you remember the video we watched i don't watch it again oh my fucking god yes that was a great
[18376.23s -> 18384.74s]  video it only has 600 thumbs down and two thumbs up it's so great you're doing great it's a great
[18384.74s -> 18396.17s]  video still don't remember the pink room stanley still no memory of this one good room though a
[18396.17s -> 18406.31s]  solid room a pretty solid room i enjoy it these really were a treat to hunt down you know if there
[18406.31s -> 18411.67s]  have been any kind of reward for finding all of these it really would have muted the intrinsic
[18411.67s -> 18420.42s]  joy of collecting them i'm very glad we resisted the temptation next one i wonder what my most
[18420.42s -> 18435.35s]  disliked video was what was it what is it my most dis no it wasn't smite should i go under the
[18435.35s -> 18453.67s]  stairs the dark souls one i don't think so it was demon lord at freddy's you know what that actually
[18453.67s -> 18462.46s]  might be it that actually might be it don't you remember yes i remember it too the past is truly
[18462.46s -> 18469.56s]  a wonderful thing why does anyone ever choose to leave it keep going yeah okay it's because
[18469.56s -> 18477.00s]  people thought that was first of all not funny and second of all people hated five nights at freddy's
[18477.00s -> 18481.08s]  i remember that yep i remember uploading that video and that was right in the middle of five
[18481.08s -> 18486.84s]  nights at freddy was getting popular and people like hated it and i was doing like this demon
[18487.40s -> 18500.89s]  like avatar thing and people didn't think it was funny so it was a double whammy oh there's this
[18500.89s -> 18507.69s]  one this is it the very first one we found in the exhibit where i introduced you to the figlarines
[18507.69s -> 18514.09s]  oh i want more memories stanley i want to keep going no this is there what came before this
[18514.09s -> 18538.63s]  the big bang i fucking hate demon lord zaraxas collect them all i don't agree with you but it's
[18539.59s -> 18553.74s]  look it's the terrible new content that we were originally sold on i remember hating it back then
[18553.74s -> 18560.22s]  the time does put a rosy filter on everything in fact i dare say i'm actually quite fond of it now
[18560.22s -> 18568.44s]  in five nights at freddy's now is more more memories more popular now than it ever was
[18568.44s -> 18587.22s]  interesting oh yes the two doors who could have forgotten that a classic memory this
[18587.30s -> 18593.26s]  that video made the game popular no it did not that was one of the least viewed videos on my
[18593.26s -> 18599.42s]  channel and i was at the tail end of that game's initial first five nights at freddy's one popularity
[18599.98s -> 18608.89s]  i was like four months late to the party and i tried to do like a fun little spin on it and
[18608.89s -> 18619.13s]  i was way too late way too late if anything that video made people dislike the game more
[18620.12s -> 18629.94s]  and me and me too and before everything else there was your office there are probably people
[18629.94s -> 18637.70s]  from like 2012 2013 there's something i feel i can remember i can remember who left in rage
[18637.70s -> 18645.62s]  and never came back from that video yes i'm remembering something now i remember before
[18645.62s -> 18652.50s]  this whole story got started back then i was i was different i used to make big decisions i was
[18652.58s -> 18659.06s]  passionate i was skeptical i weighed each decision with profound thoughtfulness and then somewhere
[18659.06s -> 18665.70s]  along the way i stopped making decisions i became lazy and i came up with well came up with a
[18665.70s -> 18670.74s]  character named stanley to do my thinking for me he would make the decisions he would decide which
[18670.74s -> 18677.06s]  way to go i would cheer him on as he collected figurines for no reason why did i invent stanley
[18677.70s -> 18683.38s]  was i lonely yes perhaps that's it perhaps i needed to imagine i had companionship
[18683.38s -> 18690.26s]  okay and stanley really did make for a wonderful companion even if he was a fiction but i suppose
[18690.26s -> 18695.88s]  it's grown old i i want to think for myself again i want to go back to how it used to be
[18696.52s -> 18704.20s]  yes i can be on my own again i can do it i'll be stronger this time i'll take care of myself
[18704.20s -> 18711.40s]  i don't need stanley anymore oh but he truly was so much fun to play with you know what
[18711.40s -> 18717.56s]  since we're in the memory zone how about one more good memory let's go back just once and
[18717.56s -> 18723.82s]  give stanley one more run of the office and one more go retire him for good i did enjoy telling
[18723.82s -> 18737.05s]  his story so very much okay here we go this is the story of a man named stanley one more i get one
[18737.05s -> 18747.14s]  more go i gotta make this count wait stanley thought to himself am i sure that the orders
[18747.14s -> 18757.64s]  stopped coming in how is that possible they never stopped surely i was mistaken this is it okay last
[18757.64s -> 18762.44s]  run the end is never the end the end is never the end the end is never the end the end is never the
[18762.44s -> 18771.80s]  end the end is never the end i need to make stanley happy with the bucket of course a good bucket a
[18771.88s -> 18777.64s]  strong bucket a humble bucket a committed bucket a bucket of culture and distinction
[18783.66s -> 18790.97s]  which way do i go they clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left how
[18790.97s -> 18806.97s]  do i how do i end the how should i how should i end it just make him happy still no one was here
[18807.53s -> 18813.05s]  stanley needed the bucket's warmth and comfort now more than ever perhaps his boss's office was
[18813.05s -> 18869.70s]  where he'd find answers reboot the game entirely today i just quit the game okay rebooting please
[18869.70s -> 18889.70s]  enter the current time 9 15 p.m hang on hang on before we get started can i just say something
[18889.70s -> 18894.74s]  thank you for actually setting the clock both times you booted up the game a lot of people
[18894.74s -> 18899.74s]  don't take that step seriously just leave the clock set at 12 and call it a day when you're
[18899.74s -> 18903.66s]  actually taking the time to set the clock and i appreciate that that's how i know that you care
[18903.66s -> 18908.70s]  about the experience you're paying attention i don't even have any way of knowing if the times
[18908.70s -> 18915.22s]  you're setting are correct tell you what i'll make you a deal since you've been so cooperative
[18915.22s -> 18920.60s]  next time you boot up the game and see the screen just set the clock to your favorite time pick
[18920.60s -> 18924.73s]  whatever time you want even if it's not the correct time you've earned it all right get back to the
[18924.73s -> 18937.42s]  video game 10 o'clock 10 p.m 10 p.m is my favorite time not too late not too early to still like
[18937.42s -> 18950.46s]  about probably a couple two or three hours left in the night relaxing reboot it again again okay
[18950.46s -> 18959.42s]  i'm gonna say no you know 9 30 is probably my favorite time when i look at the clock and i see
[18959.42s -> 18965.02s]  it's 9 30 i'm like all right there's still the whole night is there i'm relaxing i'm cool i'm
[18965.02s -> 18971.02s]  good it's at least probably three to five hours before i'm even going to think about sleep at
[18971.02s -> 18985.48s]  current time they said i could make it whatever i want 9 30 is the best time 9 30 p.m not that far
[18985.48s -> 18991.32s]  from now that's my favorite time well could you simply not resist giving me the correct time
[18991.32s -> 18996.28s]  again no that's what time that's not that's 15 minutes from now after all i know how much you
[18996.28s -> 19001.83s]  enjoy setting the time correctly and now i'm curious how accurate 9 30 p.m is let's use another
[19001.83s -> 19014.36s]  slider to find out how accurate is 9 30 p.m i would say that's very very close that's like
[19014.36s -> 19025.59s]  incredibly close right i mean that's in literally like 13 minutes you know can i just say regardless
[19025.59s -> 19029.82s]  of the accuracy of the clock i'm having a great time adjusting these settings i feel like i'm
[19029.82s -> 19036.94s]  learning more about you now you like things to be set it's good to collect data i wish we had more
[19036.94s -> 19042.06s]  sliders but we've gone through all the sliders i have perhaps i can invent some new sliders to
[19042.06s -> 19047.53s]  gather new data on you shouldn't be too hard yeah let me whip up a couple new ones to be ready by
[19047.53s -> 19082.79s]  the next time you boot up the game stop rebooting it's terrifying please adjust the slider until the
[19082.79s -> 19093.45s]  computer is barely visible i like it this is brightness please just slide into the dog and
[19093.45s -> 19113.93s]  cat are friends i'd say right about there right there please just slide until the number five
[19113.93s -> 19138.74s]  becomes the number nine one two three four five six nine nine well it says becomes the number nine
[19138.74s -> 19144.31s]  not spell it not no bullshit no roman numerals the number nine just that that's what it's telling
[19144.31s -> 19155.98s]  me to do just slide until you stop adjusting the slider okay hold on all right i think maybe
[19155.98s -> 19163.11s]  i think i'm thinking about here yeah i think so maybe just a little bit more i'm not feeling it i
[19163.11s -> 19168.14s]  think it's a little bit up right here is fine which of the two made-up words below is most
[19168.14s -> 19176.18s]  appealing to you scrumptious or ocarina oh my fucking god ocarina a million times
[19176.18s -> 19188.86s]  please don't adjust the slider okay you know what time it is right now yes i do it is nine twenty
[19188.86s -> 19200.04s]  is the time that it is right now the correct time yes what is it what is time anyway i don't know
[19200.04s -> 19211.56s]  is there anything about yourself that you haven't told me yeah shit love yeah you're a computer
[19211.56s -> 19255.03s]  yes will you come back to visit me yes what time is it does anyone really truly know of course they
[19255.03s -> 19260.34s]  don't nobody knows anything you and i don't even know each other we're like strangers sure i've
[19260.34s -> 19265.19s]  adjusted all the game settings to your exact specifications but who hasn't it's just what i
[19265.19s -> 19271.18s]  do like a day job and now the job is over there's no more information for me to gather i've collected
[19271.18s -> 19278.84s]  all the data on you that i can i still don't really know you you don't know me and neither of us know
[19278.84s -> 19285.99s]  what time it is i guess some settings are just unsettable but if i'm being totally honest the
[19285.99s -> 19290.42s]  clock doesn't do anything in the game anyways you won't have me here when the game starts next time
[19290.42s -> 19300.73s]  but that's okay video games are meant to be played alone you like being alone don't you that's maybe
[19300.73s -> 19305.72s]  the only information that i really learned about you it's not even what time for me to leave there's
[19305.72s -> 19309.56s]  still one more setting that we need to adjust but it may take a little time before i'm ready for that
[19310.20s -> 19315.16s]  not really in my job description but that's okay perhaps you'll see me again if you can find me
[19315.72s -> 19349.45s]  talk soon epilogue did i get did i get something i got something i got something epilogue many many
[19349.45s -> 19367.91s]  years later wait this is from the the skipping this is back when i skipped a bunch of times all
[19367.91s -> 19409.16s]  right yeah i guess i camped out for a night i gotta keep going it reminds me of outer wilds
[19435.90s -> 19441.86s]  to the moon towards the towards the moon towards the moon i'm gonna say towards the moon
[19441.86s -> 19473.08s]  towards the moon towards the moon to work going the direction towards the moon this is the memory
[19473.08s -> 19498.26s]  zone right didn't i leave the memory zone why am i going back to the memory zone in loving memory
[19498.26s -> 19535.82s]  the stanley parable 2 bookie nine's blog review the stanley parable 2 like so many i enjoyed
[19535.82s -> 19540.55s]  my time with the original stanley parable which underscores how truly disappointed i am with its
[19540.55s -> 19546.95s]  sequel with a first game teamed with originality the stanley parable 2 is dull uninspired and
[19546.95s -> 19552.07s]  often insulting to its fan base rather than expand on what made the first game enjoyable the sequel
[19552.07s -> 19558.01s]  veers off into territory nobody asked for an infinitely deep hole who cares where are the new
[19558.01s -> 19565.22s]  endings what about enjoyable bits from the stanley parable one like the adventure line instead we
[19565.22s -> 19571.16s]  get an uninspired side quest collecting figurines even this diversion feels incomplete collecting
[19571.16s -> 19575.19s]  all the figurines gives you nothing i must say though i found the bucket to be quite comforting
[19575.19s -> 19615.83s]  a welcome reprieve from 2027 this one stanley parable 2 is gonna come out stanley parable
[19615.83s -> 19621.78s]  developers no more spinoffs no more sequels when the stanley parable launched to a massive
[19621.78s -> 19626.58s]  success in 2013 its creators made plans to build the property into an entire franchise
[19626.58s -> 19632.62s]  but a disastrous critical and commercial reception the stanley parable 2 has prompted the developers
[19632.62s -> 19638.86s]  to rethink their ambitions as outlined in a press release they published today to clear that more
[19638.86s -> 19644.58s]  stanley parable is not what the fans want we thought that we had a vision for the series
[19644.58s -> 19648.66s]  that players would be excited about it turns out this could not have been further from the truth
[19648.66s -> 19653.70s]  press release goes on to promise to preserve the artistic integrity of the original game and
[19653.70s -> 19659.03s]  to stop assaulting fans with our reckless and insulting creative visions the word sorry appears
[19659.03s -> 19692.42s]  more than 25 times in the press release get on the green we got pretty close the cat dog friendship
[19692.42s -> 19760.17s]  will last forever i can go left stanley that's me what are they all the only one is it stanley
[19760.17s -> 19799.83s]  okay oh cool 25 perfect that's a perfect number thank you for enjoying the new content yeah it
[19799.83s -> 19815.34s]  was pretty good that was fun anything else hello again it's nice to see you but it's terrible to
[19815.34s -> 19821.13s]  learn that there will never be another stanley parable game did you read what the developer said
[19821.13s -> 19827.64s]  preserve the integrity of the franchise what nonsense stanley parable is not sacred we do
[19827.64s -> 19832.33s]  not need to protect it screw the legacy let's keep making stanley parable games until the sun
[19832.33s -> 19838.34s]  explodes let's run this franchise into the ground let's drag it through the mud and back and if
[19838.34s -> 19843.26s]  people hate it who cares you see that was the narrator's problem he was so obsessed with what
[19843.26s -> 19848.81s]  people thought of his work don't make his mistake don't cling to the legacy let it burn it's not
[19848.81s -> 19854.04s]  hard in fact let me show you together we're going to make the stanley parable three it's simple all
[19854.04s -> 19859.19s]  we do is change the number in a game's title screen we also really need a really dumb subtitle
[19859.19s -> 19864.15s]  for the game something loud and gaudy good try combining some random words together to make a
[19864.15s -> 19887.67s]  new title for our game but what i say was let's get it stanley parable three let's get it stanley
[19887.67s -> 19925.08s]  parable three pantry pantry i love it every time you restart the game we'll advance the number of
[19925.08s -> 19931.50s]  sequels by one and then we'll pick a new subtitle that way the stanley parable will never end and
[19931.50s -> 19936.06s]  nothing in the game itself will change when you do this either adding more content sounds like work
[19936.06s -> 19940.98s]  no need to do that it will just be the same content recycled again and again and again with a new
[19940.98s -> 19947.19s]  title screen what do you say should we go forward with this plan i like it but i want you to have a
[19947.19s -> 19958.70s]  say as well should i do that that sounds kind of funny sure let's do it a new sequel every time
[19958.70s -> 19962.70s]  you start the game and you know what did you put faith in my idea i feel like giving you something
[19962.70s -> 19967.19s]  as well see i'm noticing that the narrator's never found a way to give you the broken achievement
[19967.19s -> 19972.49s]  did he of course not i wouldn't expect him to know how it's been bothering me let's fix it
[19972.49s -> 19976.89s]  all right there the achievement machine is all fixed see i'm on your side we're in this together
[19976.89s -> 19982.02s]  we're going to keep this train rolling the stanley parable cannot end it can only spiral in on
[19982.02s -> 19988.14s]  itself forever i must keep the wheel turning i'm ready are you ready great there's only one last
[19988.14s -> 20020.98s]  thing we need to do please enter the current time i'm 30 i'm 30 that's my favorite time okay
[20028.73s -> 20036.62s]  this is the story of a man named stanley stanley worked for a company in a big building where he
[20036.62s -> 20046.22s]  was employee number 427 employee number 427's job was simple he sat at his desk in room 427
[20046.22s -> 20051.90s]  and how do i go get the um the achievement orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling
[20051.90s -> 20059.66s]  him what buttons to push how long to push them and in what order this is what employee 427 did
[20059.74s -> 20065.66s]  every day of every month of every year the new content door although others might have considered
[20065.66s -> 20071.26s]  it so ranting stanley relished every moment that the orders came in oh the content door okay we
[20071.26s -> 20079.43s]  have been made exactly for this job and stanley was so the narrator made this guy up well then
[20079.43s -> 20084.55s]  who's the computer then one day something very peculiar happened something that would forever
[20084.55s -> 20090.17s]  change stanley who's the computer something he would never quite forget he had been at his desk
[20090.17s -> 20096.57s]  for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him
[20096.57s -> 20102.81s]  to follow no one had showed up to give him instructions call a meeting or even say hi
[20103.69s -> 20109.77s]  never in all his years at the company had this happened this complete isolation i don't think
[20109.77s -> 20116.57s]  the intro changes very clearly wrong shocked frozen solid stanley found himself unable to
[20116.57s -> 20122.81s]  move for the longest time but as he came to his wits and regained his senses he got up from his
[20122.81s -> 20130.79s]  desk and stepped out of his office okay all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean
[20131.43s -> 20135.35s]  stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo
[20135.35s -> 20149.29s]  how is the new content ah where's the content embrace of an old friend a weathered companionship
[20149.37s -> 20157.64s]  that stands the test of time stanley clung the bucket to his cheek could his co-workers really
[20157.64s -> 20172.54s]  all be gone oh please are you really just doing this for the achievement yeah click a door five
[20172.54s -> 20177.98s]  times is that all that you think an achievement is worth no no no no i can't just give these

[20183.34s -> 20188.14s]  to click the door 20 times you got it i would say that's the kind of effort that warrants recognition
[20189.18s -> 20196.62s]  i have to say i'm still not feeling the satisfaction of witnessing true effort
[20196.62s -> 20202.38s]  for a noble cause gonna be like a thousand perhaps 50 clicks will do it yes almost certainly 50
[20207.02s -> 20212.54s]  no no i'm still not feeling it you see now that you've gotten the bucket involved what standards

[20539.42s -> 20543.90s]  none of them are ready yet i'm still developing them they're not even close to finished how did
[20543.90s -> 20549.10s]  they look when you saw them were they captivating were they exciting did they fulfill on the promise
[20549.10s -> 20554.54s]  of everything that a sequel to stanley parable could possibly be yeah i figured out how the hell
[20554.54s -> 20562.01s]  to make a sequel to this game you had you had a little bit of trouble you had a little bit of
[20562.01s -> 20570.02s]  trouble wait if you're still carrying the bucket around with you if the bucket is interesting to
[20570.02s -> 20576.34s]  you that means i must have made it correctly yes you carrying the bucket with you everywhere
[20576.34s -> 20582.42s]  is exactly what i set out to accomplish the bucket is the exciting and captivating new content that
[20582.50s -> 20589.38s]  i promised i did it i win i made a sequel to the stanley parable yes the sign is correct thank you

[20606.42s -> 20612.42s]  stanley parable now they are one and the same there is no stanley parable without the bucket

[20626.31s -> 20634.06s]  i want to go to the sequel area all of his co-workers were gone what could it mean stanley
[20634.06s -> 20638.38s]  decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed i want to oh i gotta go without the
[20638.38s -> 20648.63s]  bucket i have to go without with the bucket yeah i don't bring the bucket yeah no no no bucket
[20648.63s -> 20659.43s]  right because then we they'll yeah without the bucket all right let's go yeah bring bucket take
[20659.43s -> 20669.58s]  the bucket no no no do a bucket get the bucket take the bucket no no don't bring the bucket i
[20669.58s -> 20675.10s]  got the bucket made stanley want to be a better man and a better co-worker in time perhaps he
[20675.10s -> 20686.22s]  would become both of those things all right i'm going in with a bucket everybody's called me an
[20686.22s -> 20699.34s]  idiot and here we are we're fine we're good you see stanley i've been reflecting on the stanley
[20699.34s -> 20704.78s]  parable and about how roundly disappointing this ultra deluxe version has turned out to be
[20704.78s -> 20709.42s]  i don't think so which nor stanley parable was a landmark i think it adds a lot new content for it
[20709.42s -> 20716.86s]  should live up to that legacy so forget this ultra deluxe nonsense i say we no no no no no no no no
[20716.86s -> 20723.90s]  even further which is why i'm very proud to announce for the first time ever the stanley
[20723.90s -> 20735.30s]  parable too oh no we're good yes you see isn't this far superior to a measly re-release with
[20735.30s -> 20740.58s]  a few minor additions think of all the new territory will cover with a fully fledged sequel
[20740.58s -> 20746.10s]  an entirely new experience built from the ground up why there are so many possibilities it could
[20746.10s -> 20753.62s]  go in so many different directions this is what fans have truly been asking for now to be clear
[20753.62s -> 20759.14s]  i haven't looked at the table down what exactly too late too late is going to be but let's take a
[20759.14s -> 20763.70s]  look at some of the features i've been developing all right let's go achievement figure that if i
[20763.70s -> 20768.66s]  can loosely organize a handful of interesting concepts that surely the game will sort of
[20768.66s -> 20774.74s]  naturally spring up around them it'll all work itself out game development is much more of a
[20774.74s -> 20783.35s]  fuzzy magic than anything scientific or logical really two buckets okay let's go get two buckets
[20783.35s -> 20801.18s]  go on try out some of the new features give me a second bucket i deserve it wait there are two
[20801.18s -> 20806.22s]  buckets here how did you get a second bucket there's no two buckets and comfort of a single
[20806.22s -> 20811.42s]  button is already so great so intoxicatingly wonderful with two buckets there's no telling
[20811.42s -> 20821.22s]  stanley can you still hear me are you with me oh stanley what oh thank god i didn't lose you
[20821.22s -> 20827.78s]  stanley the no buckets was too much i had to destroy both oh get out of here i know how much
[20827.78s -> 20836.17s]  the bucket meant to you and take the risk i hope one day you can forgive me well what am i going
[20836.17s -> 20851.03s]  to do now without that i was so used to picking it up every single day oh well okay uh now the
[20851.03s -> 20866.22s]  achievement room right all right where's the free achievement this way that's sad all right here we
[20866.22s -> 20878.36s]  go free achievement now here's something special you remember that broken test achievement that
[20878.36s -> 20883.32s]  got left in the game on accident well i'm developing a technology to simply give you the
[20883.32s -> 20888.84s]  achievement yes you see you'll come to this lever and when you pull it the achievement will be
[20888.84s -> 20899.74s]  given to you it's as simple as that got it as you can see the machine is not working yet yes it is
[20899.74s -> 20906.50s]  wait what in the holy hell is going on you've got the achievement why did the machine work stanley i
[20906.50s -> 20913.22s]  didn't fix it i didn't do anything to it i swear it was broken just a second ago who fixed it is
[20913.22s -> 20924.18s]  someone here are we being watched oh god composure composure yes as you can see the machine is
[20924.18s -> 20932.26s]  working as normal as i intended it um it truly speaks to the awe-inspiring magic of the stanley
[20932.26s -> 20952.81s]  parable too breathe just breathe well all right i got it i win should i do the infinite hole what
[20953.37s -> 20965.98s]  what other exhibits haven't we seen yet up on your lip i can't help it calling it the stanley
[20965.98s -> 20972.06s]  parable too is just so much all right where's the hole ultra deluxe don't you think ultra deluxe
[20972.06s -> 20978.54s]  what does it even mean your blood is leaking out parable too now that's an artistic statement
[20978.54s -> 20984.94s]  right there all right we'll do the hole oriented it screams progress and innovation and long-term
[20984.94s -> 20992.30s]  franchising potential time is it right now it is currently just about 10 pm 9 50 stanley here's
[20992.30s -> 20998.06s]  an idea that i'm truly fond of it's never been done before in a video game this is in fact a
[20998.06s -> 21005.42s]  hole that you can fall down forever that's right infinite falling you can fall until the end of
[21005.42s -> 21012.14s]  time if you like a stunningly hard for video games as a medium you see isn't it wonderful
[21012.14s -> 21017.74s]  okay anything change here ingenious concoctions if i do say so now then since you've gotten to
[21017.74s -> 21023.90s]  see the infinite hole you can press the teleport button to pop back up to the top and it changes
[21023.90s -> 21029.98s]  here all right nothing changes all right now i'm very excited to show you even more of my ideas
[21029.98s -> 21051.88s]  for the sequel okay cool i don't have the bucket that's right okay so i think i'm gonna i want to
[21051.88s -> 21063.32s]  go do the mind control without the bucket i had the bucket the first time yeah i know i did it
[21063.32s -> 21075.42s]  already all the weird stuff all right we're gonna reset and i want to go do the mind control thing
[21075.42s -> 21081.16s]  turn the machine on without the bucket and then that'll probably wrap it up all of his co-workers
[21081.16s -> 21086.92s]  were gone what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed
[21086.92s -> 21101.70s]  a memo do the window ending yeah i'm looking at the windows i don't see a window yeah i did i did
[21101.70s -> 21109.43s]  the infinite hole thing a long time ago yeah okay i'm not doing that we're gonna go turn on the mind
[21109.43s -> 21118.09s]  control machine which is a set of two open doors he entered the door on his left no it's the where's
[21118.09s -> 21131.14s]  it's the right jump out the window climb the deck all right we'll do that after this i want to turn
[21131.14s -> 21140.70s]  on the uh mind control thing yet there was not a single person here either feeling a wave of
[21140.70s -> 21146.62s]  disbelief stanley decided to go up to it stanley stepped into the broom closet but there was nothing
[21146.62s -> 21154.34s]  here so he turned around and got back on track coming to a staircase stanley walked upstairs
[21154.34s -> 21160.54s]  to his boss then it's down right is it down to go to the mind control room no it's up
[21163.72s -> 21178.50s]  oh up up all right it's like gotta go to the catwalk i know i'm not supposed to talk about
[21178.50s -> 21187.34s]  these things mods and mods are gonna be pissed but i just somebody you added the term
[21187.58s -> 21195.08s]  um stepping into his manager's office stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication
[21195.08s -> 21201.96s]  of oh mods typing shocked unraveled stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this
[21201.96s -> 21207.32s]  what dark secret was being held from him what he could not stanley was in such a rush to get
[21207.32s -> 21211.64s]  through the story as quickly as possible i'm not gonna enable it didn't even have a single stop
[21211.64s -> 21215.48s]  reading i'm not gonna read this stuff anymore nope i'm not doing it i'm not i'm not putting
[21215.48s -> 21220.28s]  pressure on the mods for no reason he relaxed for a few moments with some calming new age stop
[21220.28s -> 21270.94s]  reading our stuff no no wait you hold on i i hold a second apparently a term was permitted to
[21270.94s -> 21281.74s]  permissions like to add to permissions right permitted term finger butthole it was added to
[21281.74s -> 21296.66s]  the permitted terms not removed not banned that was permitted was it banned because of
[21296.66s -> 21306.22s]  the elden ring streams oh and there it's gone it's definitely because the elden ring streams
[21306.22s -> 21311.77s]  people would probably just like finger butthole my finger butthole i get it i get it but now that
[21311.77s -> 21323.82s]  it's like you know it's been a while let's add the term finger butthole and then i just ruined it
[21323.82s -> 21334.98s]  whoops let's see everybody relax with the chill music all right feeling soothed and rejuvenated
[21335.86s -> 21342.50s]  calmly walked forward into the open it's just funny like oh add it show the humor with that
[21342.50s -> 21350.25s]  this that's so that's very humorous like i look over and i see like uh permissions added for you
[21350.25s -> 21372.15s]  know finger butthole like oh okay we got permissions i just make the mods um job way way harder don't i
[21373.03s -> 21382.55s]  that gets you banned that gets you timed out and i am making it really really difficult the building
[21382.55s -> 21386.95s]  stanley realized he felt a bit but the running joke is that i would be banned from my own
[21386.95s -> 21392.39s]  channel in his chest as though he felt more free to think for himself true to question the nature
[21392.39s -> 21399.27s]  of his job why did he feel this now when for years it had never occurred to him this question
[21399.27s -> 21407.27s]  would not go unanswered for long okay here we go stanley walked straight ahead through the large
[21407.27s -> 21413.11s]  door turn it on without the bucket facility i want to see what the mind control ending without
[21413.11s -> 21422.42s]  the bucket is the lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens what horrible
[21422.42s -> 21428.42s]  secret did this place hold stanley thought to himself did he have the strength to find out
[21429.62s -> 21443.19s]  now the monitors jumped to life their true nature revealed each bore the number of an employee in
[21443.19s -> 21448.15s]  the building okay so what happens when i turn it on the lives of so many and then i'll do that
[21448.79s -> 21454.39s]  window ending that people are saying and that's it one of them eternally monitored in this place
[21454.39s -> 21463.45s]  where freedom meant nothing oh mods going chaotic evil i'm allowing all of these oh
[21465.34s -> 21471.98s]  this mind control facility it was too horrible to believe it couldn't be true had stanley really
[21471.98s -> 21477.34s]  been under someone's control all this time was this the only reason he was happy with his boring
[21477.34s -> 21488.18s]  job that his emotions had been manipulated to accept it blindly no he refused to believe it
[21488.18s -> 21496.50s]  he couldn't accept it his own life in someone else's control never it was unthinkable wasn't
[21496.58s -> 21504.10s]  it was it even possible had he truly spent his entire life utterly blind to the world
[21505.46s -> 21512.86s]  all right now you guys now you're just reaching now you're reaching operation
[21512.86s -> 21518.94s]  controls labeled with emotions you're reaching now you're all reaching or content you're hey you
[21518.94s -> 21524.22s]  play with fire i'm just saying you're playing with fire you're gonna get timed out very place
[21524.22s -> 21529.74s]  and as the cold reality of his careful careful stanley decided you don't want to touch that
[21529.74s -> 21538.22s]  line too far be careful it's terrible power over another human life would dismantle the controls
[21538.22s -> 21546.52s]  once and for all right turn it on oh stanley you didn't just activate the controls did you
[21546.52s -> 21550.76s]  after they kept you enslaved all these years you go and you try to take control of the machine
[21550.76s -> 21559.11s]  for yourself is that what you want control stanley i applaud your effort i really do
[21559.11s -> 21565.27s]  but you need to understand there's only so much that machine can do you were supposed to let it
[21565.27s -> 21572.15s]  go turn the controls off and leave if you want to throw my story off track you're going to have to
[21572.15s -> 21577.51s]  do much better than that i'm afraid you don't have nearly the power you think you do for example
[21577.51s -> 21583.83s]  and i believe you'll find this pertinent stanley suddenly realized he had just initiated the
[21583.83s -> 21589.91s]  network's emergency detonation system in the event this machine is activated without proper
[21589.91s -> 21596.23s]  dna identification nuclear detonators are said to explode eliminating the entire complex
[21599.91s -> 21606.23s]  let's say um two minutes two minutes ah now this is making things a little more fun isn't it stanley
[21606.23s -> 21613.67s]  run it's your time to shine you are the star it's your story now shape it to your heart's desires
[21613.67s -> 21618.87s]  oh this is much better than what i had in mind what a shame we have so little time left to enjoy
[21618.87s -> 21624.63s]  it five mere moments until the bomb goes off but what precious moments each one of them is
[21625.19s -> 21632.79s]  more time to talk about you about me where we're going what all this means i barely know where to
[21633.43s -> 21639.03s]  start four you'd like to know where your co-workers are i need to press the number four
[21639.03s -> 21645.19s]  moment of solace before you're obliterated all right one two you're gonna die anyway i'll tell
[21645.19s -> 21651.27s]  you exactly what happened to them i erased them i turned off the machine i set you free
[21651.27s -> 21657.03s]  three of course of course four in this instance of the story where's four i tell it i simply let
[21657.03s -> 21661.43s]  you sit there in your office forever pushing buttons endlessly and then dying alone
[21662.55s -> 21669.03s]  other times i let the office sink into the ground swallowing everyone inside or i let it burn to a
[21669.03s -> 21675.43s]  crisp i have to say so this version of events has been rather amusing watching you try to make
[21675.43s -> 21681.27s]  sense of everything and take back the control rested away from it's quite rich i almost hate to
[21681.75s -> 21689.43s]  go but i'm sure whatever i come up with on the next go around or even better my goodness
[21689.43s -> 21696.31s]  i need 34 seconds left but i'm enjoying this so much you know what to hell with it i'm going
[21696.31s -> 21703.13s]  to put some extra time on the clock why not these are precious additional seconds stanley time
[21703.13s -> 21710.18s]  doesn't grow on trees oh dear me what's the matter stanley is it that you have no idea where you're
[21710.26s -> 21715.54s]  going or what you're supposed to be doing right now or did you just assume when you saw that timer
[21715.54s -> 21721.62s]  that something in this room was capable of turning it off i mean look at you running from button to
[21721.62s -> 21728.50s]  button screen to screen clicking on every little thing in this room these numbers buttons no these
[21728.50s -> 21735.22s]  colored ones or maybe this big red button or this door everything anything something here will save
[21735.86s -> 21739.62s]  me why would you think that stanley that this video game can be beaten
[21741.70s -> 21744.98s]  do you have any idea what your purpose in this place is
[21748.02s -> 21753.46s]  stanley is any key to send power sir quite a disappointment but here's a spoiler for you
[21753.46s -> 21758.58s]  that timer isn't a catalyst to keep the action moving along it's just seconds ticking away to
[21758.58s -> 21762.90s]  your death you're only still playing instead of watching a cut scene because i want to watch you
[21762.90s -> 21770.10s]  for every moment that you're powerless to see you made humble this is not a challenge it's a
[21770.10s -> 21777.46s]  tragedy you wanted to control this world that's fine but i'm going to destroy it first so you
[21777.46s -> 21784.86s]  can't take a look at the clock stanley that's 30 seconds you have left to struggle 30 seconds
[21784.86s -> 21791.02s]  until a big boom and then nothing no ending here just you being blown to pieces will you cling
[21791.02s -> 21797.66s]  desperately to your frail life or will you let it go peacefully another choice make it come
[21797.66s -> 21803.42s]  or don't it's all the same to me all a part of the joke and believe me i will be laughing at
[21803.42s -> 21827.16s]  every second of your inevitable life from the moment well shit all right where's the window
[21828.60s -> 21834.12s]  what could it mean stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps he had simply missed a memo
[21834.12s -> 21839.08s]  how do i was the window one heart stanley looked he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers
[21841.14s -> 21856.46s]  use the chair other chair like up here at first stanley assumed he'd broken the map until he
[21856.46s -> 21861.98s]  heard this narration and realized it was part of the game's design all along he then praised the
[21861.98s -> 21867.18s]  game for its insightful and witty commentary into the nature of video game structure and its
[21867.18s -> 21871.74s]  examination of structural narrative tropes do it again with the bucket now that you're here what
[21871.74s -> 21877.50s]  do you think isn't this a fun and unique place to be why don't we take a minute just to drink
[21877.50s -> 21887.10s]  it all in all right okay i'm over it now what do you think are you sick of this gag yet no ah then
[21887.10s -> 21892.22s]  in that case we'll continue but now here comes the real question what do you think would have
[21892.22s -> 21897.58s]  happened if you had told me that you wanted this to stop do you think it would have been particularly
[21897.58s -> 21903.18s]  different reset would i have taken the same idea but rephrased it superficially to fit that answer
[21903.74s -> 21908.30s]  perhaps you never would even have thought of it if i hadn't brought up the issue in the first
[21908.30s -> 21913.42s]  place you would reset the game now think about it will it be worth it for you to restart and then
[21913.42s -> 21919.90s]  come back here just to do the other option clearly this whole gag takes some time what if the other
[21919.90s -> 21926.06s]  option is even longer how long would you spend in total just to have heard all the narration oh and
[21926.06s -> 21930.94s]  one omega low in there just played the other option omega low you come to see one omega low
[21930.94s -> 21938.14s]  this one so what do you think which choice was the better one imagine if you had selected continue
[21938.14s -> 21943.26s]  on your first playthrough how tantalizing it would be not knowing what happens when you pick
[21943.26s -> 21949.34s]  the other option indeed you are one of the lucky ones though if the other option is really miserable
[21949.34s -> 21955.18s]  to listen to then perhaps you're not in fact i'm just going to say that no one who's listening to
[21955.18s -> 21961.90s]  this is lucky well now i've built up the other options so much that i'm going to stop talking
[21961.90s -> 21967.26s]  and leave you to your decision whether to come back here continue with the game or just sit in
[21967.26s -> 21980.58s]  this spot forever and ever jesus don't come back with bucket first of all okay fuck off how long
[21980.58s -> 21987.46s]  was i sitting there stanley wandered to himself minutes exactly centuries did something not
[21987.46s -> 21992.98s]  everyone is so lucky to have a bucket but stanley is a very lucky fellow very lucky indeed
[21993.94s -> 22012.87s]  what the fuck is that yes whispered the bucket into stanley's ear we've done it we've escaped
[22012.87s -> 22018.71s]  from that dull office and that pesky narrator at last out here in the white void we are alone
[22018.71s -> 22025.19s]  now and for the first time i can reveal to you my true self the bucket began to tell stanley of
[22025.75s -> 22031.11s]  its history of the countless wars it witnessed desecrating the land and lives of untold numbers
[22031.11s -> 22037.35s]  of innocent humans and the buckets own complicity therein of sadness and regret and the many years
[22037.35s -> 22042.95s]  it spent dwelling on the actions it might have taken to curb the madness and the decay if only
[22042.95s -> 22048.87s]  it had been stronger of hope and redemption and its crusade to uplift the stock of life for the
[22048.87s -> 22055.59s]  common man to manifest justice where none existed and the bittersweet reality of time to see one's
[22055.59s -> 22062.07s]  dreams and wishes met halfway meted out in parcels like charity and abandoned as soon as the warm
[22062.07s -> 22069.27s]  glow of inspiration begins to dim the opportunities to do so much more there was so much it could have
[22069.27s -> 22075.91s]  done perhaps the bucket wondered to itself perhaps if it had seen its own darkness with a clearer
[22075.91s -> 22082.63s]  perception this was way too much for stanley what are you talking about he screamed you're a
[22082.63s -> 22090.39s]  bucket to this the bucket furrowed its brow now said the bucket not since the evil wizard gamb
[22090.39s -> 22096.07s]  horata first ensnared me in his machinations as payback for the sacred amulet i stole from
[22096.07s -> 22101.51s]  his treasured vaults i was young back then and could not conceive the ramifications of
[22101.67s -> 22113.50s]  no stanley screamed even louder this time this is stupid you are a bucket this is so stupid
[22113.50s -> 22119.98s]  why are we even doing this as stanley screamed and screamed and screamed the bucket revealed its true
[22119.98s -> 22125.10s]  form transforming into a mighty beast of untold power we're gonna see things glistening like
[22126.06s -> 22140.17s]  oh god stanley you did it you saved us from the bucket thank god you already had all 12 emblems
[22140.17s -> 22145.53s]  of sages and knew the incantations to summon their true power otherwise we would have easily
[22145.53s -> 22150.97s]  been overwhelmed by the bucket's power i'm speechless you've demonstrated such bravery
[22150.97s -> 22157.85s]  here today come let's restart the game and we'll agree to never again go trifling with this bucket
[22157.93s -> 22169.05s]  nor the dark magic cast away inside of it blood all of his co-workers were gone all right what
[22169.05s -> 22174.25s]  could it mean that's it stanley decided to go to the meeting room perhaps it takes a lot of humility
[22174.25s -> 22180.01s]  to carry a bucket so magnificent all right that's it checked his ego that's it proceeded all right
[22180.01s -> 22184.89s]  that's it stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left
[22185.77s -> 22193.40s]  all right that's it still no one was here i'll see you tomorrow that's it stanley needed the
[22193.40s -> 22199.08s]  bucket's warmth and comfort now more than ever perhaps his stanley we must move on from this
[22199.08s -> 22204.76s]  broom closet simply because i have no remaining stickers if i did you coming to a staircase
[22204.76s -> 22211.46s]  stanley on the bucket walked upstairs to the boss's office no don't go down here i want to go up
[22227.06s -> 22233.46s]  so tomorrow we are going to do infomercials stunned to discover not an indication of any
[22234.18s -> 22237.62s]  probably that's it but stanley gets the correct code by sheer luck
[22238.26s -> 22242.58s]  was it that the bucket knew all along always streams where i want won't be that long
[22242.58s -> 22254.23s]  it'll be like four showers this is certainly the logical explanation watch infomercials okay
[22255.32s -> 22269.98s]  now i go back up all right but not yet do you like this game wait down then up okay
[22272.39s -> 22285.86s]  yeah i do i think it's fun the elevator race downward plummeting towards an unknown fate
[22287.06s -> 22292.74s]  it would be all stanley could do to keep himself together if not for the bucket soothing him
[22292.74s -> 22297.46s]  comforting him reassuring that in this darkest moment of uncertainty are you gonna finish this
[22297.46s -> 22306.31s]  game right um it is here for you stanley everything will be fine i i didn't i i think i did didn't i
[22306.31s -> 22311.10s]  get to the few endings like the true ending i think i saw the true ending stanley said to the
[22311.10s -> 22315.42s]  bucket can we go back i think i've seen it when i was pressing those keypad buttons there was
[22315.42s -> 22319.90s]  something very intriguing about the number three i want to go back so i can try pressing the number
[22319.90s -> 22345.40s]  three again the bucket said nothing okay press the number three here we are said stanley now i'm going
[22345.40s -> 22351.00s]  to try out that number three button he took the bucket over to the keypad and began absolutely
[22351.00s -> 22357.50s]  slamming on the number three over and over and over well he said the number three is such a
[22357.50s -> 22363.50s]  special button i'm having the time of my life stanley looked expectantly at the bucket but the
[22363.50s -> 22369.26s]  bucket remained silent this was a shock to stanley who had always felt such a connection with the
[22369.26s -> 22375.50s]  bucket how was this not as exciting to the bucket as it was to him once stanley had had enough of
[22375.50s -> 22432.81s]  the number three he got back in the elevator do it eight times eight that was weird perhaps the
[22432.81s -> 22438.81s]  bucket had missed perhaps it had not seen how much joy stanley got from slamming the number three
[22438.81s -> 22449.27s]  repeatedly go back up a hint of regret nagged in the back of stanley's mind should he demonstrate
[22449.27s -> 22459.82s]  the number three for the bucket again sure no no no no no said stanley you can't go on yet
[22459.82s -> 22465.34s]  not did you understand how much the number three means to me you and i have been through so much
[22465.34s -> 22473.34s]  together and i just want you to see what i see feel the happiness i feel he smiled at the bucket
[22473.34s -> 22479.50s]  and the bucket said nothing yeah the voice actor for the narrator is amazing very funny perfect
[22479.50s -> 22492.34s]  perfect role okay three here we go said stanley this time i'll really show you
[22492.34s -> 22497.86s]  he ran to the number three and began to wail on it like a musician on a beloved instrument
[22497.86s -> 22504.42s]  waving a concerto of truth and passion he wielded the number three like a fine artist would wield a
[22504.42s -> 22510.90s]  paintbrush he taught stories through the number three stories of his dreams and hopes and fears
[22510.98s -> 22517.22s]  the whole time he looked to his bucket for a reaction of some kind anything to let him know
[22517.22s -> 22522.90s]  that the bucket appreciated what he was doing the bucket conveyed absolutely nothing at all
[22523.70s -> 22533.93s]  only silence crushed by a wave of dejection stanley returned to the elevator the bucket hates me now
[22535.85s -> 22547.77s]  why stanley and the bucket were so close it always been there for one another why suddenly
[22547.77s -> 22553.13s]  could the bucket not connect with this passion of stanley's the question caused stanley to
[22553.13s -> 22558.57s]  kill the bucket i did not kill the elevator he knew that there must be a way to get through to
[22558.57s -> 22563.85s]  the bucket to communicate fully with his dear friend surely there was a solution mustn't there
[22563.85s -> 22589.26s]  be that wasn't another life do it again again again again said stanley i know what to do
[22589.26s -> 22595.42s]  i know how to fully express this feeling in my heart he decided right then and there that he
[22595.42s -> 22601.02s]  would hold a press conference where he would speak to the public on all matters relating to pressing
[22601.02s -> 22607.26s]  the number three over and over he would elaborate fully on what the number three meant to him and
[22607.26s -> 22613.10s]  why he felt so alive when pressing it then the bucket would be able to see his joy through the
[22613.10s -> 22619.90s]  eyes of others it would get to see the world react to this discovery of stanley's and it would be
[22619.90s -> 22626.38s]  through the public eye that the bucket would finally understand stanley's work press conference
[22627.93s -> 22633.85s]  for months he advertised and marketed his press conference building excitement around it developing
[22633.85s -> 22640.57s]  and rehearsing it until it couldn't be refined a single measure further when the big day arrived
[22640.57s -> 22660.98s]  stanley was as prepared as he'd ever been for anything in his life stage door okay this was it
[22661.72s -> 22668.20s]  one last chance to win the bucket over one opportunity to share a true connection with
[22668.20s -> 22688.90s]  a loved one okay the dude who came up with pizza there was no one here nobody had come to the press
[22688.90s -> 22694.82s]  conference to hear stanley speak to listen to him talk about what it really means to press the
[22694.82s -> 22701.53s]  number three on a keypad over and over he was nobody literally no one interesting he was a
[22701.53s -> 22707.29s]  failure no one in that moment stanley knew that the bucket would never again take him seriously
[22708.30s -> 22714.23s]  there would be no connection no deeper understanding the bucket merely sat there in
[22714.23s -> 22721.11s]  his arms indifferent and so it began that slowly over many years the two of them grew more and more
[22721.75s -> 22723.19s]  this is germacon attendance
[22730.71s -> 22736.79s]  i'm not my mother would go there would be no more games sorry no more long conversations about
[22736.79s -> 22745.16s]  passion and pursuit only a silence that consumed the space between friends and stanley
[22745.80s -> 22750.60s]  having for once in his life discovered the warmth and comfort of true companionship
[22751.16s -> 22758.22s]  was cast back into the unremarkable normalcy of loneliness i thought you said nobody was here
[22758.22s -> 22795.69s]  just heard somebody cough a lie wait rare phone spawn rare phone spawn this where's it message
[22795.69s -> 22801.13s]  scheduled either by you or person in your place of work the purpose of this message is to warn
[22801.13s -> 22805.85s]  you about the dangers of recorded messages if at any time you believe you are listening
[22805.85s -> 22811.21s]  to a recorded message please terminate it immediately and cease all flow of information
[22811.21s -> 22819.13s]  from the recorded message into your perceptual sphere hello hello hello hello no it's your first
[22819.13s -> 22825.05s]  day be careful for be careful foxy watch out the thing that i do i want to tell you about
[22825.05s -> 22836.66s]  foxy is foxy yeah foxy stanley cradled the bucket in a gentle embrace protective
[22836.66s -> 22842.18s]  yet delicate assertive yet compassionate stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his
[22842.18s -> 22847.38s]  this was not the correct way to the meeting room but stanley had felt the bucket calling to him
[22847.38s -> 22854.02s]  telling him that the employee lounge was simply the place to be and here it was had the bucket
[22854.02s -> 22861.22s]  turned out to be correct was no never mind the bucket was wrong stanley took the door on his left
[22861.22s -> 22869.85s]  to go back to the meeting room no said the bucket don't go to the meeting room go somewhere else
[22869.85s -> 22876.73s]  the cargo lift yeah good said the bucket whatever um all right i'll see you guys tomorrow
[22885.86s -> 22887.38s]  wait i want to try this i want to restart the game
[22891.48s -> 22895.61s]  will it be stanley power before when i open it again and that's the last thing i want to see
[22896.09s -> 22903.42s]  uh i'll give you my review for the stanley parable 2 the stanley parable ultra deluxe edition i
[22903.42s -> 22910.14s]  think it's a really good uh i think it's a good edition i think it's like the definitive version
[22910.14s -> 22923.27s]  of the game i think it's very good there's definitely enough content there and plus it's
[22923.27s -> 22949.53s]  just a fun experience it was very nice it was a very nice time all right that's it see you later
[22950.17s -> 22968.33s]  see you tomorrow around four o'clock we'll watch some infomercials for a few hours have a great

[22985.11s -> 22990.55s]  infomercials and i the reason why i only want to do like three or four hours is i don't i don't
[22990.55s -> 22995.59s]  want to overdo it because they're so stimulating and there's so much that you can kind of get like
[22995.59s -> 23010.79s]  infomercial overload so i think like a solid three or four hours is good that's the plan for
[23010.79s -> 23029.51s]  tomorrow infomercial scientist you promised to eat a glove and i am got to get one it'd take me
