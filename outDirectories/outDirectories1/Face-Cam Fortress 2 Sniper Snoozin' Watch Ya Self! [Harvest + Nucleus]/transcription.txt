[0.31s -> 12.82s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[12.82s -> 17.24s]  Gonna be playing on Harvest, just casually playing some Sniper.
[17.24s -> 20.24s]  Try to shave some people's heads down a size.
[20.24s -> 24.06s]  I love Harvest, you all know that.
[24.06s -> 29.11s]  Where the hell is everybody? Am I gonna have to go like Super Secret Sniper?
[29.11s -> 37.62s]  Let's go. Watch your head. Watch your head. That's a two piece double cheeseburger.
[37.62s -> 44.62s]  I'm actually very, very tired right now. So anytime I play Sniper, if I'm really, really tired, I can do very, very well.
[44.62s -> 48.18s]  I don't know why. I think it's because... Ah, there's a spy.
[48.18s -> 54.18s]  I think it's because I just relax a whole lot more than if I was, you know, stressed out and trying to get headshots and stuff.
[54.18s -> 57.18s]  But I just, you know, just... Who cares? Let's just play. Who cares?
[57.18s -> 67.76s]  Ready? Ready? Come on out. Come on out and meet your maker. Anybody. Any second now. Any... I missed.
[67.76s -> 70.96s]  Right here. Pyro.
[77.09s -> 81.33s]  Are we gonna win? Oh, we did it. Good thing I was here for the whole round. Let's do another one.
[81.33s -> 88.32s]  Try to win Shiv, huh? Let's go in the spawn and just like smash, smash, smash.
[88.32s -> 95.02s]  Uh oh. I ran out of coffee. Trying to keep myself awake and I just completely ran out of coffee.
[95.02s -> 97.02s]  That can't happen for a Jerma video.
[97.02s -> 102.02s]  There has to be a full coffee here at all times, ready to go down my throat, into my stomach, into my brain.
[102.02s -> 104.02s]  And let's do it, baby.
[104.02s -> 109.06s]  A zoo.
[111.06s -> 119.98s]  Oh, heavy. If you didn't have crits, I would have killed you. I still might.
[119.98s -> 123.54s]  Oh, sneaky little snake.
[123.54s -> 130.49s]  And that's how you snipe somebody's skullcap off. You're real. Let's get it again.
[130.49s -> 136.98s]  That is... That's a spy. You are def... You are not a real Pyro. I do... Yeah, I knew it. I could tell. I could tell.
[136.98s -> 141.48s]  Neither are you. You're not real either and I just keep missing these spies.
[141.48s -> 147.94s]  I love that hat, by the way. That Antla hat that that engineer has on right now. I love that thing.
[147.94s -> 150.24s]  That's like one of my favorite hats.
[150.24s -> 154.76s]  What is it? Merasmus's hat, I think is what it is.
[154.76s -> 162.29s]  This is a very bad spot for me to be right now. Very... Oh, damn it.
[162.29s -> 168.61s]  Come on. What's going on, y'all?
[168.61s -> 177.27s]  I'll take it. I'll take it. Oh, no. I'll get this guy. I'll get this guy. I'll get this guy.
[177.27s -> 184.85s]  I backed up right into that. How many people are in this server? There's plenty of people in here.
[184.85s -> 193.54s]  There's at least like two dozen people in here. Oh, no, there's not. Two dozen is 24. Right. Yes, Roger.
[193.54s -> 200.46s]  All right. Let's get some more kills. I got to make sure... No. Spy behind you. I got to kill him before he kills him.
[200.46s -> 205.17s]  Oh, he... Oh, he got the... He must have got... No, he didn't.
[205.17s -> 212.02s]  You? Spies everywhere. And who's behind me? You little prick. Come here.
[212.02s -> 219.59s]  Oh, thank God, Heavy, you just saved my life. All right. I need to get my head on straight here.
[219.59s -> 235.49s]  I'm gonna die. Get my head on straight. Don't get backstabbed. Right as I said it. Right as I said it, I got backstabbed.
[235.49s -> 241.66s]  All right. You know what? Am I going to do this right now? I think I'm putting on the Razorback.
[241.66s -> 250.06s]  It's time for the Razorback to go on, bros. Backing up into spies, backing up into knives. This started off pretty well.
[250.06s -> 259.54s]  No. No. He's not dead. Make sure he stays dead. Is it... Is their team just spies and pyros? What's going on here?
[259.54s -> 266.37s]  All right. We got the point. That's a good thing. Oh, you...
[266.37s -> 275.87s]  Stay in sniper. I'm going to stay sniper on principle. This is a long respawn. Holy shoot. That's like an 18, 17 second respawn.
[275.87s -> 286.28s]  I've only killed four people. All right. Let's pull this out here. I got to get some more headshots. Let's go.
[286.28s -> 297.97s]  We're going to win this. How are we winning right now? There we go. You stay still. But there's a spy somewhere.
[300.87s -> 308.61s]  Somewhere over the rainbow way.
[316.29s -> 322.66s]  I'm like singing karaoke. How did I not hit him? I was going to say it. I hit that guy right in his mouth.
[322.66s -> 337.62s]  That too. I should have hit that guy right in his face. God damn it. Oh, hey. Yeah. Yeah. You didn't get me that time, spy.
[337.62s -> 352.92s]  I hit Razorback ranked up. What's a level one? Yeah. Oh, I got him in midair. Did I? I don't even know. Where's he going? Where's he going?
[352.92s -> 361.55s]  Hey, that guy was... That engineer. Wow. EngineerGG. We got time for one more? I think we got time for one more. Why not?
[361.55s -> 367.98s]  All right. Well, we have changed maps to Nucleus. How are we going to end this? I'm going to give myself three lives right here.
[367.98s -> 377.49s]  Three lives to do as much damage and as much offensive power as I possibly can. I might not even do anything. We might just win the match.
[377.49s -> 391.73s]  Let's see. Oh, looking for someone like this scout. Where is he going? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This spy is so dead. Maybe not.
[391.73s -> 398.72s]  He's going to kill me. No, he's definitely not dead. There's no way. I hit him like in the shoulder blade. Whoa. Who's on that point?
[398.72s -> 407.22s]  Oh, I got him in the head. Didn't matter. I can't. I can't shoot with this thing. Oh, that was so lucky. You cannot shoot from the hip with that damn thing.
[407.22s -> 417.76s]  Why did I pick it? Well, because it's awesome. That's why. That's why. Bro, you are. Are you kidding me?
[417.76s -> 424.69s]  He was like sitting up on the ledge. He was like chameleon blending in with the background, too. That was ridiculous.
[424.69s -> 433.75s]  Whatever. That's one. Two more deaths. Maybe we'll win. I'm assuming it'll be like one death per minute. Maybe not.
[433.75s -> 451.72s]  Yeah. You want to dance around? You want to dance? Yeah. I swear I thought that was a spy. Speaking of spies. Oh, man. I can't even shoot anybody.
[451.72s -> 466.50s]  Team is just too good. All right. So anyways, apparently we have the point locked down. Yeah, there's people on the other team.
[466.50s -> 476.91s]  I think there's just oh, almost fell off the cliff. What? How did that hurt him in the face? I can't believe that.
[476.91s -> 486.72s]  I run that back. He's got one health. That that line went right into in between his eyes.
[486.72s -> 496.33s]  That was a bunch of baloney and cheese sandwiches stuffed underneath like my grandmother's ass. Oh, my God. That was gross.
[496.33s -> 504.53s]  Baloney and cheese. You know, I love baloney and cheese sandwiches, but you have to be in the mood for baloney and cheese sandwiches.
[504.53s -> 511.35s]  Otherwise, it's just gross. Well, this was a completely successful round. I killed like one person.
[511.35s -> 518.94s]  You know what? Just get over here. Get the hell over here. You can shoot me all you want. I'm going to get this. I'm going to get this kill.
[518.94s -> 528.23s]  And this one, too. You know what? Oh, no, he's got a big sword. Your sword's way bigger than mine. All right. Well, that's three.
[528.23s -> 535.42s]  You know what? We'll wait till the end because we're about to win right now for as well as my team is doing.
[535.42s -> 546.68s]  I haven't really done anything. I just be kind of just sitting around like a real freak. Here we go.
[546.68s -> 558.97s]  Twelve seconds. I got to get an epic headshot right here. Epic headshot. No, this has just been like me versus but you know what?
[558.97s -> 568.13s]  I got an epic headshot right here. Didn't get it. Just might as well jump off the cliff over time over time.
[568.13s -> 573.43s]  Hey, I know you got like your camping gear. Look at this guy's just like opening and closing the gate over and over again.
[573.43s -> 578.43s]  I think you have enough ammo and health. I think you don't know. Stop. Stop opening that. You don't need any more.
[578.43s -> 582.61s]  Look, you got to save the rest for the rest of the damn team. There's rations in there. You're eating them all.
[582.61s -> 587.06s]  Anyways, guys, thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[587.06s -> 593.06s]  Facecam Fortress 2, Sniper, Tire, Jerma for the loss or for the win. I'm not really sure, but I'll see you guys all soon.
[593.06s -> 595.06s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
