[12645.79s -> 12650.37s]  those of you that um we talked a lot about the carnival earlier and i wanted to reiterate one
[12650.37s -> 12661.79s]  more time that you can expect something like that to happen every few months now that shit is already
[12661.79s -> 12666.69s]  we're already starting to work on a talk on the next one not carnival life i'm just saying just
[12666.69s -> 12681.57s]  something like that and i brought this all the way over here oh this is bad you're gonna get hit in
[12681.57s -> 12688.35s]  the face of the frog every couple months maybe depends on what we do all right is he going to
[12688.35s -> 12701.30s]  steal the soccer ball if they see this will they take it dude don't take the ball away from me
[12701.30s -> 12708.86s]  take out your cell phone videotape this and make like two hundred thousand dollars by this youtube
[12708.86s -> 12715.78s]  video that would have a billion views film it sell it to a news agency license the video out
[12716.88s -> 12721.68s]  put cat food out now or bird food out in front of your door to bring this fucking goose back
[12723.20s -> 12730.16s]  to get new videos every day carry the goose you would be worth millions of dollars
[12730.80s -> 12748.19s]  why would you be angry at this this is just depositing free money into your checking account
[12748.19s -> 12754.22s]  all you have to do is film it it's an awesome goose it doesn't understand what money is
[12754.94s -> 12767.20s]  and then you could just buy the goose a gigantic goose house and put all the things that goose
[12767.76s -> 12799.10s]  love the most in there that was not a bad shot there it is don't roll all the way down where is
[12799.10s -> 12811.68s]  it this one sucks i'm going the wrong way the net is right over here is this not the correct net

[13313.65s -> 13332.51s]  can i get there from here because then if i wrap around this way here's the pub
[13333.07s -> 13362.05s]  um good to go is the person not delivering you know oh his ass is still all red why is it coming
[13362.05s -> 13377.34s]  in blood because there was this crazy weird really really kind of screwed up part of the game where
[13377.34s -> 13382.14s]  you put a bunch of glass down you break a bunch of glass bottles and you make him walk in the room
[13382.14s -> 13386.94s]  and you scare him and he lands and he sits on them it's horrible it's kind of out of place in
[13387.82s -> 13405.63s]  out of place in a game like this weirdly i don't know all right excuse me
[13407.23s -> 13417.76s]  i have some performing to do i've got the ribbon i'm ready for my close-up
[13597.18s -> 13606.38s]  i'm done with the game i think i think that's the end of the game i've done what i wanted to do
[13607.90s -> 13618.48s]  that was very fun that was a great what about the mail that's one thing there's probably a secret
[13618.48s -> 13627.73s]  with the mail right there are a lot of random stuff look at all those where's the secret menu
[13628.69s -> 13639.15s]  it doesn't even show up what about the boat oh wait let's try that you just wanted an excuse to
[13639.15s -> 13650.99s]  do your funny voices oh yeah i had to do my my voices i'll get the boat i have to let it go on
[13650.99s -> 13660.22s]  the water i guess okay is this a cartoon if i remove the no duck sign does that mean that
[13660.22s -> 13678.50s]  ducks i can go in there oh looks like ducks are allowed in here no problem at all if only there
[13678.50s -> 13686.74s]  was a sign that said no ducks could come in here i would not even have attempted all right well i
[13686.74s -> 13715.10s]  was if i gotta sneak in no no get out i'm not going near that box if i from you take this box
[13715.10s -> 13727.12s]  back but what catch an object get thrown over the fence dress up with things steal the old man's

[13741.97s -> 13761.97s]  take this what what kind of magic trick did we just do that was an act huh all right i'm just
[13761.97s -> 13797.52s]  gonna leave there we go use her to get thrown over the fence all right um i need a toy boat
[13818.74s -> 13822.99s]  i'm not even in there anymore don't worry well i can't get on the first step i'm not
[13822.99s -> 13837.78s]  allowed to step on the first step that's not even your place of business shut up that's
[13837.78s -> 13850.56s]  enough falling fall down all right i got the uh okay you're just really you're pissing me off

[14074.66s -> 14086.05s]  good good get thrown over the fence and i'm in the water though kind of went all the way back
[14086.05s -> 14104.83s]  didn't i whatever works that's true i still i can i not can i not go in here all right i'm gonna
[14104.83s -> 14154.00s]  hide that there that's fine all right that might be it it might be time i was trying to get it as
[14154.00s -> 14160.30s]  close to being in without it going in rake in the lake there you go the thing you wanted to see so
[14160.30s -> 14176.56s]  bad i don't know why why why is that the thing in this game why is that the thing oh okay wait
[14176.56s -> 14187.31s]  what did i even examine this stuff i got my collection of cans and i want i kind of want
[14187.31s -> 14199.49s]  another one of these games i want another one right i want i want another game like this i'm
[14199.49s -> 14207.42s]  hungry for more can this be one of those stories where the developer made this just goofy game and
[14207.42s -> 14216.18s]  oh that was fun just a funny little game and then they get like three million dollars in funding to
[14216.18s -> 14227.46s]  do it again do it with different animals yeah do like a bear untitled bear game what would wait
[14227.46s -> 14241.55s]  probably not as a rat you can make a lot of fun scenarios instead of a little squeak it's that
[14241.55s -> 14249.50s]  loud bear scream i would love to just eat out of people's trash and by the way there's i'm
[14249.50s -> 14255.66s]  gonna give you a i'm gonna call the back of the box the tell us how we're doing comments that's
[14255.66s -> 14260.22s]  on the back of randomly for some reason like drinks and sodas and shit you don't remember that
[14260.22s -> 14265.02s]  stuff all right you there's a honk button there's a grab button that needs to be also a swallow
[14265.02s -> 14271.87s]  button i'm gonna be able to eat this stuff like i need to be able to chew this and swallow and eat
[14271.87s -> 14285.44s]  it that'd be fun no no dedicated shit button that's not what i mean i'm just i want to be able to
[14285.44s -> 14290.42s]  just chew stuff up i'm gonna be able to pull the slipper off the guy's foot and just chew it up
[14290.42s -> 14301.26s]  have i played the cat lateral damage i actually have this i like this more than that though that
[14301.26s -> 14309.87s]  game is more just to make a mess for 30 seconds this is just walk around and be a duck and this
[14309.87s -> 14315.25s]  is more charming to me than the goat simulator was you know i i'm gonna give you a stamp of
[14315.25s -> 14330.38s]  recommendation on this one this it's cute it's cute enough but that is probably it's actually
[14330.38s -> 14334.75s]  probably gonna do it for today i have a couple things i need to get done i have to get ready
[14334.75s -> 14351.09s]  for twitchcon i have to pack i am going to stream tomorrow so this is not just the only stream we're
[14351.09s -> 14363.33s]  gonna get this week i'll see you guys tomorrow tomorrow is it kind of also up in the air this
[14363.33s -> 14368.13s]  was just a random game that turned out this is i had a lot of fun this is great uh tomorrow is
[14368.13s -> 14372.46s]  going to be similar though i don't really have much of a plan haven't really been around i just
[14372.46s -> 14380.18s]  kind of got back been out of i've been out of the i don't even know what games have come out i don't
[14380.18s -> 14386.21s]  even know what's released in the last like week and a half or so so we'll do something for at
[14386.21s -> 14397.65s]  least like a good five six hours tomorrow before i have to leave i'll figure it out community
[14397.65s -> 14403.25s]  content stream tomorrow uh i don't think so i think it's too early for that i want to give
[14403.25s -> 14408.13s]  people at least a few weeks at least a month or so to really get the first one nice and meaty
[14410.19s -> 14417.26s]  we'll figure it out but again i want to make this very clear too my stream schedule is pulling back
[14417.98s -> 14422.54s]  remember four or five months ago when i talked about after the carnival stream
[14423.36s -> 14430.70s]  i was going to start to pull the streams back an hour or two streams are going to be starting
[14433.01s -> 14437.41s]  an hour or two early than they are than they happen so instead of like three to four
[14438.05s -> 14448.30s]  pacific it's going to be somewhere around like two like one to two pacific so between like four and
[14448.30s -> 14454.56s]  five eastern is where i want the streams to start from now on and i've talked about a little bit
[14454.56s -> 14463.22s]  more the streams because i'm on pacific time if i stream till like 10 11 12 at night it's really
[14463.22s -> 14468.69s]  really late for everybody if people watch from europe there it's like six o'clock in the morning
[14469.79s -> 14473.23s]  eastern time it's like two three o'clock in the morning so i'm going to pull it back
[14476.14s -> 14502.02s]  and with that guys we are going to transition to uh hold on a second hold on the new outro screen
[14504.93s -> 14512.43s]  thanks for coming everybody appreciate everybody's uh coming in good shit oops i
[14512.43s -> 14518.75s]  fucked it up i screwed it up you weren't supposed to see that hold on there we are
[14519.39s -> 14523.34s]  everybody welcomed uh please don't throw your popcorn at the screen
[14523.34s -> 14531.09s]  i appreciate if you wouldn't please make a a formal exit on the left side there are your exits
[14534.24s -> 14540.70s]  and uh thanks for coming up i need to figure out how this works because this is the first
[14540.70s -> 14549.23s]  time i've tried it don't throw tomatoes at me either either hold on peter let me figure this
[14549.23s -> 14558.27s]  out because this name is up here i don't think this is i think i screwed this up
[14559.15s -> 14576.82s]  did i screw this up maybe not oh i definitely messed it up somehow i'll figure it out next
[14580.05s -> 14590.40s]  but this will have all the the highest bit tip of the day whoever gave the highest
[14591.74s -> 14595.18s]  and then on the right side it'll be the whoever gave the most during that
[14595.18s -> 14599.90s]  period and then the top sub gifter on the left i actually might try to cycle these out too
[14600.70s -> 14607.92s]  maybe i'll do like today's bit leader and then have like longest running gifted the longest running
[14607.92s -> 14614.46s]  sub or something like top sub gifting so many people give gifted subs that it's almost like
[14614.46s -> 14632.10s]  it's its own category 10 000 but this also this track loradale made all this i've been sitting
[14632.10s -> 14642.43s]  on it for a while i love this out this song is great i will get these correct here's the
[14642.43s -> 14659.47s]  cool thing about this though everybody has left see you later guys only a few of you still in
[14659.47s -> 14676.37s]  here i can also get rid of those people too it's a rat then we can hang out here by the way the
[14676.37s -> 14684.43s]  screen up there i can drop the music and we can put something up there pictures random videos
[14684.43s -> 14697.15s]  stuff like that how cool is this though the germaplexis cinema is the janitor
[14697.87s -> 14713.65s]  you wait yeah you guys could do a webcam in there too yeah there's the rat still clean it up and
[14713.65s -> 14727.87s]  then janitor can finish up over here and then take a look at this it's over why are we inside of your
[14727.87s -> 14741.04s]  mouth that's a great question so this is the first of quite a few of these i gotta get back in touch
[14741.04s -> 14746.00s]  with loradale and we'll do the next few parts there's gonna be a lot of tracks a lot of audio
[14746.00s -> 14756.56s]  a bunch of new transition scenes i'm trying to really get it going but yeah i will figure out
[14756.56s -> 14773.73s]  how i messed that up somehow rip the old outro that is not true still here because that plays
[14774.77s -> 14792.62s]  when the stream is actually over and we can come back over to here while we just hang out i do want
[14792.62s -> 14804.53s]  to add a bunch of things but these are fucking fantastic as they are now get a couple more
[14804.53s -> 14818.22s]  scenes in here some more cleanup you but my burping is annoying what do you mean burp my burping
[14818.78s -> 14829.50s]  you need to hire a new janitor no did the intro screen change not yet i plan on doing a whole
[14829.50s -> 14839.79s]  thing but uh why don't we do the bits thanks everybody for watching that's gonna be it
[14839.87s -> 14856.43s]  the transition is scary well good so all of you get to get out of here i love that all the
[14856.43s -> 14865.06s]  everybody all the people leaving the theater he's actually going to be switched around
[14867.65s -> 14877.22s]  they all came back in i can leave that up for as long as i want to but why don't we go ahead and
[14877.22s -> 14886.40s]  go back uh earlier today thank you everybody again first stream back from the carnival

[15293.66s -> 15298.22s]  uh i gotta stream labs obs is kind of weird i have to figure out how to do this stuff
[15298.94s -> 15306.70s]  because it's when you add a source the sources already exists it's kind of i think it's gonna
[15306.70s -> 15317.14s]  take some getting used to oh yes uh by the way this is i i didn't this is how i've been sitting
[15317.14s -> 15330.85s]  in here for a very long time i'm just realizing this right now so uh this is a fucking this is a
[15330.85s -> 15350.70s]  weird movie hey all of you come back in the theater it's not done yet um we had alchemy can
[15351.94s -> 15357.22s]  thousand bits from alchemy can 10 bucks thanks for the carnival man here's for you and your
[15357.22s -> 15363.89s]  team's work we all appreciate it a lot of time went into that and a lot of people were involved
[15363.89s -> 15372.19s]  even just the robots alone trying to figure out what i wanted to do and could that translate to
[15372.19s -> 15382.19s]  actually have it on video and camera we when we were when we were setting up the inputs i remember
[15382.19s -> 15390.30s]  just going uh to the one of the engineers i was like so um how much can that handle how much can
[15390.30s -> 15395.50s]  you actually handle in this thing how many inputs per second i was like because it's probably gonna
[15395.50s -> 15403.66s]  be like it's probably gonna be like a thousand inputs a second and i remember his his eyes kind
[15403.66s -> 15412.99s]  of widening him going oh shit okay so we should let me see if i can figure that out god i think
[15412.99s -> 15418.93s]  that it really and that was by the way probably two or three hours before the stream started
[15418.93s -> 15423.57s]  because we were planning on thinking how we were going to do it should i have sub only turned on
[15423.57s -> 15428.37s]  no i don't really want to do that because that's i'd rather have as many people participate as
[15428.37s -> 15433.65s]  possible because it's more chaotic right it's more fun that way but do i need to mitigate the amount
[15433.65s -> 15442.29s]  of inputs that come in because the machines physically cannot take it chat went so fast my
[15442.29s -> 15448.54s]  feed was buffering yeah i put on a little slow mode just to try to help there was a couple of
[15448.54s -> 15454.66s]  points when i think this you guys broke the server they were connected to and that's when i had to
[15454.66s -> 15466.70s]  kill time for 10 straight minutes sometimes but it was worth it it was worth it there was more
[15466.70s -> 15476.70s]  than 16 000 people there i know it's a rat um yeah i think it was it was almost at 16 5 17 000
[15476.70s -> 15483.30s]  concurrent that's the highest i've ever had ever i think it just blew it completely blew it away
[15483.30s -> 15504.78s]  where did you find those clowns they were they were in the area the old one was like 12k now it
[15504.78s -> 15512.99s]  it blew past my previous high of viewers that came in a lot of new people too and even i mean
[15512.99s -> 15522.45s]  if you if you're new here even today um there was like 62 6300 people here today that's a lot of new
[15522.45s -> 15528.27s]  viewers i think so hopefully you like it here maybe you were just checking out the stream i
[15528.35s -> 15535.20s]  followed just to see what it was all about hopefully we see you again because there was
[15535.20s -> 15545.26s]  a lot of new people here i think today yeah i'm talking about the old how what the record was to
[15545.26s -> 15558.72s]  break the old one viewership wise the official twitch uh yeah i saw the tweet too they tweeted
[15558.72s -> 15563.74s]  it out they and they like censored it too that was that was that's my favorite part it's like

[15569.18s -> 15577.50s]  three times they like cut out the swear it's all right whatever i gotta clean up my act a little

[15654.80s -> 15660.67s]  testing on how heavy things needed to be and apparently those frogs were the perfect weight
[15660.67s -> 15668.59s]  to launch uh i'm not exactly sure where they got them only knew is that frogs needed to be involved
[15668.59s -> 15676.32s]  because you know i'm a frog or i'm a rat you know i'm a frog i'm a rat i like both those animals

[15822.42s -> 15831.30s]  carnival stream um i would not have put a payment on that there's no way i would have done that
[15831.86s -> 15839.92s]  i wanted as many people to come check it out as possible i'm not putting a pay to watch
[15839.92s -> 15845.20s]  or pay to participate i just i don't want to do that i'd rather have as many people as possible
[15845.20s -> 15851.36s]  see it that's more important to me than trying to make extra money i i guess i don't really
[15851.36s -> 15858.37s]  that doesn't could i have like sub gated that or something but what the fuck do i carry you
[15858.37s -> 15863.09s]  know i mean i don't i don't i'd rather have people watch it than have um it be sub gated or
[15863.09s -> 15876.82s]  something more publicity yeah i mean i guess that's normal what i was thinking of when i wanted to do
[15876.82s -> 15880.66s]  this though was not how do i i want to get all of it everywhere how do i get on the front page of
[15880.66s -> 15891.28s]  every page that just was something that i wanted to do i'm happy it was received well i'm very happy
[15891.92s -> 15897.04s]  i mean if it was received really poorly then that's a completely different story

[16087.30s -> 16092.82s]  that's the first time and not even the first time we've done stuff like that before not to that

[16121.70s -> 16126.66s]  you know i mean i am absolutely fortunate that people think that this shit is still interesting
[16126.66s -> 16133.76s]  so that's all i that's really what i have to say you have to make the funny streamer noise now
[16134.24s -> 16137.36s]  now that only comes out when it comes out i don't even control that it just comes out

[16227.20s -> 16237.26s]  and seats this person's been keeping their mouth open for a very long time i'm the dentist i'm the
[16237.26s -> 16245.78s]  comedy dentist open up i would be a pretty good dentist no i wouldn't i'd be a terrible dentist
[16246.34s -> 16250.26s]  i got my hands are like so shaky i wouldn't be able to ever do anything like that
[16251.06s -> 16255.42s]  but i'll store h2o thanks to the 250 i know you probably heard this a lot over the past week but
[16255.42s -> 16258.22s]  the carnival stream is probably the best stream that's not the best piece of media that i've seen
[16258.22s -> 16262.62s]  all year you and the rest of the team did an excellent job and i'm glad it was able to call
[16262.62s -> 16272.24s]  all come together get that stream nominated for an emmy i'm so fucking happy i i'm so happy that you
[16272.24s -> 16283.31s]  guys liked it there's always this little demon in the back of your head that even when we got
[16283.31s -> 16291.81s]  up to like like the day before is just sitting there going you know this whole thing could just
[16291.81s -> 16299.09s]  go completely fucking wrong and nobody will think it's funny and nobody will think it was interesting
[16299.09s -> 16307.89s]  and i'm just sitting there going get get up get out of here the asmr demon now obviously there
[16307.89s -> 16312.69s]  was so much that went into this that i was that was not really on my brain at all i was we were
[16312.69s -> 16319.57s]  too busy and too focused on trying to get it to get together and as time came forward we realized
[16319.57s -> 16322.85s]  that it was going to be a lot of fun so but it doesn't matter like i always just want to make
[16322.85s -> 16326.93s]  sure that people regardless of how much money the stream costs or it doesn't matter if it's that
[16326.93s -> 16331.81s]  stream it could be this stream too the one that you just watched the one that you're on right now
[16332.61s -> 16336.75s]  now i just want to make sure that it's something fun something interesting something people don't
[16336.75s -> 16342.83s]  take away something that they didn't like or that sucked i don't want you to think that
[16344.83s -> 16350.51s]  now go ahead no spit please go ahead and rinse and spit oh wait and we're in a dark room too
[16352.14s -> 16363.66s]  imagine going to the dentist and it's this dark in here would you leave all right what if it was
[16363.66s -> 16374.88s]  like five star rated dentist on yelp would you go to this dentist yeah it turned out the dentist had
[16374.88s -> 16379.68s]  this weird thing with like light he just just dude they just couldn't have light on it was something
[16379.68s -> 16383.60s]  with a it was a some kind of condition or something with light you couldn't be in light but he was
[16383.60s -> 16390.51s]  like the best dentist in the world would you be in like a dark room dentist thing who rates dentists
[16390.51s -> 16412.67s]  on yelp you rate every people write every business on yelp don't they where's the whale right here

[16605.52s -> 16613.20s]  this so every single person that was working on it was having a great time and i was so that was
[16613.20s -> 16619.20s]  insanely important to me was i want to make sure everybody is comfortable everyone's having a good
[16619.20s -> 16623.28s]  time that everyone you're like passionate about this project and then you really really like it

[16859.55s -> 16874.18s]  70 dollars yeah that ship shipping from america overseas always is an extra at least one to two to
[16874.18s -> 16882.72s]  300 percent wherever it's going i wish i could change it but that's another reason why i like
[16882.72s -> 16891.04s]  to keep my t-shirts cheaper i like to keep all my t-shirts at like 18 to 22 dollars because i know
[16891.04s -> 16895.20s]  you're gonna spend like 30 fucking dollars to have it shipped to you if you're from another country
[16900.11s -> 16911.12s]  so i completely understand those who they bought your shirts from uh from eu how much was the
[16911.12s -> 16940.99s]  shipping is there a like an average 50 20 20 bucks 50 bucks two roblox well i think we got
[16940.99s -> 16949.89s]  two actual answers in there so i think that maybe even one how many people like this there's like
[16950.45s -> 16968.88s]  3200 people here and i get one real answer wow damn all right but thank you again that was uh
[16968.96s -> 16972.24s]  okay ice cream i'm really sorry that you have to spend that much money to get anything shipped
[16972.88s -> 16980.45s]  i wish shipping wasn't so ridiculous for some places hey uh ov peel thanks for the five dollars
[16980.45s -> 16988.67s]  no message just 500 bits egg johnson 500 bits hey germa been watching since 2012 when i was like
[16988.67s -> 16995.49s]  15 and seriously man you've gotten better in your senior 60 plus years you do some avant-garde shit
[16995.49s -> 17001.18s]  and it's insanely inspiring also how do i stop uh cutting myself with a safety razor i do it every
[17001.18s -> 17006.86s]  single time but i've been using it for like two years well it's here's the thing you gotta be very
[17006.86s -> 17013.71s]  very gentle and careful when you shave with a safety razor you gotta let the weight of the blade
[17013.71s -> 17021.70s]  do the work you don't push you don't drag let the weight of the blade do it slight angle gentle
[17021.70s -> 17027.14s]  i know that some people have places to be you got time i don't want to shave it's gonna take 20
[17027.14s -> 17037.94s]  minutes to shave just relax and let just work it gently you don't have to go fast when people
[17037.94s -> 17045.28s]  shave their faces that's why some of these brands they do so well because they have the 12 blades
[17045.28s -> 17049.44s]  and they have all the jelly shit all over it and they've been engineered in a way to make it so
[17049.44s -> 17054.59s]  you can shave your entire face in the same amount of time that it takes to brush your teeth no you
[17054.59s -> 17075.18s]  that should not be what you do that's how you get irritation more blades reduce irritation i'm telling
[17075.18s -> 17085.33s]  you just rip the hair out more blades reduce here too i yeah but they've been engineered and designed
[17085.33s -> 17092.06s]  that way to make it so people just you get i used to know somebody this is fucking crazy by the way
[17092.06s -> 17100.94s]  and this i'm not making this up i knew somebody that shaved with water and it was it was impossible
[17100.94s -> 17114.51s]  to me it was impossible to shave with water they had to have been lying but it wasn't a situation
[17114.51s -> 17121.36s]  where somebody was gonna lie it was just really randomly off the cuff just not being pressed on
[17121.76s -> 17127.15s]  they just mentioned it without it we weren't even we weren't even talking about shaving really
[17127.15s -> 17133.28s]  well i just use water it just came out like oh we talked about just it randomly popped up somewhere
[17133.28s -> 17147.38s]  it wasn't like i can't wait to lie about how i shave my face i use ketchup soap maybe they
[17147.38s -> 17159.12s]  talk maybe they do soap i couldn't do that either though the soap in water i would be so scared i
[17159.12s -> 17178.78s]  have to have a big santa beard of cream before i even begin i thought you meant they shaved literally
[17178.78s -> 17185.18s]  using water no blade no no like they put like they put water on their face and shaved
[17185.18s -> 17202.62s]  their face with the water on their face how that's not even possible what's wrong with just using
[17202.62s -> 17213.44s]  water are you you shave with just water you gotta fill us in that's it freaks me out you do yes you
[17213.44s -> 17225.57s]  do i do i do yes okay how do you not tug it doesn't tug it tugs doesn't it when you shave
[17225.57s -> 17243.68s]  it's like you just do it but you have you just have to pressure the blade carefully you just do
[17243.68s -> 17255.23s]  it i don't i would never shave with just water i would get to a point where i would you can hear
[17255.23s -> 17272.26s]  it it goes like and then you feel a tug and i stop and i go i'm not doing it yeah i don't i
[17272.26s -> 17283.82s]  could never do it but thank you egg johnson for the 500 bits appreciate it where does face go oh

[18297.46s -> 18301.54s]  250 bits hey germ i've been a long time fan was wondering if there was a gonna be a follow-up to
[18301.54s -> 18306.42s]  the story of my old bones the greatest video ever created there will never be a follow-up
[18306.42s -> 18312.74s]  video to that because the story that has been told the story has been told already there's no need
[18313.06s -> 18321.65s]  than that guy uh that captain uh i don't know the story he's already told it i like how german
[18321.65s -> 18330.56s]  moves out west to do more projects but did a project out east the project started in the west
[18331.20s -> 18341.52s]  by the way hold on a second here it wasn't the east coast okay it was eastern time but it was
[18341.52s -> 18346.64s]  it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't in matt it was not east coast it was like middle of the country
[18348.62s -> 18361.49s]  it was not on the east coast it was eastern time in a central location that would be central time
[18361.49s -> 18367.73s]  no that's not true because in some states uh county by county it changes from central to eastern i
[18367.73s -> 18387.09s]  don't know why so you did it in england you got it is the beautiful great state of indiana this
[18387.09s -> 18398.59s]  guy has a lot of tomatoes why indiana well because it was easy for us to transport the robots
[18401.34s -> 18407.20s]  very very easy there's nothing here there's plenty there what are you talking about
[18415.30s -> 18426.93s]  why not do it indoors why would i do a carnival indoors that would be scary an indoor carnival
[18432.90s -> 18443.09s]  it would be like this if you come into indiana from chicago it smells like a paper mill
[18446.30s -> 18457.28s]  i don't i don't even know what that means do i like west world i love season one of west world
[18459.01s -> 18464.96s]  that's about it the mall of america is basically an indoor carnival yeah but i

[18952.26s -> 18962.16s]  hear i don't i am that's very very humbling i'm so happy that you have that opinion if you really
[18962.16s -> 18968.88s]  think that then there's much more i could probably i could do i there's we're not even started yet
[18968.88s -> 18975.44s]  you know like we're just getting up to like the top of the hill it's not even it hadn't even
[18975.60s -> 18984.66s]  started yet so thank you i don't even know what to say if somebody really thinks that uh your

[19029.04s -> 19035.73s]  the years uh i don't want to just kind of talk bullshit and nonsense like oh all i care about is
[19035.73s -> 19042.45s]  all i care about is the community yeah like thought bubble like no i don't that's a lie i'm just
[19042.45s -> 19053.74s]  saying it i hope that over the last like four or five years he lied about spore though that's true
[19053.74s -> 19059.78s]  you can hold that against me i ain't perfect though you know what i mean like i ain't fucking
[19059.78s -> 19070.19s]  perfect i'm not even close just be real is all i can ask that's all i want to do that's all i
[19070.19s -> 19076.66s]  can do i can't pretend i can't do it you'll know you know easy just to see through somebody when
[19076.66s -> 19084.24s]  they're just beating you dog shit like i can't do it i could never do it i'm not smart enough

[19104.90s -> 19110.18s]  now there's tons of people that do this shit that feel the same way you probably watched some of
[19110.18s -> 19118.69s]  them already there are a lot of people that that do think that so this is not a trying to stand on
[19118.69s -> 19123.01s]  a pedestal or something i'm just i'm really happy that people think that this is still a good fucking
[19123.01s -> 19130.08s]  place to hang out and still growing and people still have fun and i'm able and capable to do
[19130.08s -> 19135.54s]  stuff like i did a few days ago because there are people that watch that care about this channel

[19326.54s -> 19333.41s]  elaborate stream also you should totally throw borderlands 3 on your off stream games and also
[19333.41s -> 19339.31s]  was wondering if you were gonna stream or play death stranding also happy birthday thank you for
[19339.31s -> 19342.91s]  the birthday wish i appreciate i appreciate that thank you i don't know if i'm gonna play death
[19342.91s -> 19351.60s]  stranding i'm probably not going to play borderlands 3 i didn't really play borderlands 2 i played
[19351.60s -> 19356.64s]  borderlands 1 you know what there i think there's a video of me playing borderlands 2 for like 10
[19356.64s -> 19362.74s]  minutes with like three or four people that's buried somewhere on the channel there's a border
[19362.74s -> 19382.42s]  lands 2 episode 1 let's play how many episodes other this probably two or three two no i just
[19382.42s -> 19390.18s]  have i'm not really into like the whole loot shooter thing anymore i'm looking for something
[19390.18s -> 19405.58s]  else borderlands 3 is a mess right now i i would not know i've not been around but yeah um probably
[19405.58s -> 19414.19s]  not gonna play the uh death stranding on stream i don't think i would do that that's more so that's
[19414.19s -> 19418.83s]  probably something that i would want to do just on my own and just kind of enjoy it kind of like
[19418.83s -> 19423.79s]  what i'm doing with god of war i know i know people can be very mad about this i'm currently
[19423.79s -> 19431.06s]  well not currently but i was currently playing through god of war off stream it's been great
[19432.69s -> 19437.33s]  i know i know i've been there's been a lot of times where i've gone you know i really wish

[19484.59s -> 19490.83s]  of you that are new uh give you maybe kind of curious of what is going on here but probably
[19490.83s -> 19496.99s]  should have said this in the very beginning of this kind of wind down uh at the end of 95 percent
[19496.99s -> 19506.05s]  of all streams i don't read bits or subs on stream so at the very end of a stream we'll just kind of
[19506.13s -> 19511.73s]  hang out and i'll go over what's come through and respond to messages and stuff like that and we then
[19511.73s -> 19518.14s]  we'd run uh sub credits at the end so that's probably if you were curious as to why you didn't
[19518.14s -> 19522.94s]  see any notifications or you didn't see i wasn't talking to or reacting to any bit messages is
[19522.94s -> 19530.26s]  because i i do i do not do that i also have a twitter too somebody's linked it is my name
[19530.26s -> 19545.09s]  brad no my name is uh my name is jerry elbertson thank you but we were down here at where were we
[19545.09s -> 19550.21s]  yes that was flug boy uh that gave the happy birthday 500 bits and they talked about the
[19550.21s -> 19556.05s]  carnival stream i really appreciate it thank you dubski dude thanks for the 500 bits five dollars
[19556.05s -> 19560.83s]  from dubski dude hey germa i heard you were strapped for cash so here's five whole dollars
[19560.83s -> 19565.76s]  to pay for the carnival stream that should cover most of the expenses no need to thank me but for
[19565.76s -> 19571.63s]  real though i can't believe you pulled it off i was very impressed with the sheer creativity of it
[19571.63s -> 19575.87s]  and i'm not kidding when i say you're a visionary it's great to be able to watch you progress into
[19575.87s -> 19584.78s]  bigger and better skits but the real question is germa tv show when you're watching it right
[19584.78s -> 19595.74s]  now you're you are currently watching it right now you're on the channel this is the channel
[19595.74s -> 19609.55s]  you're on it's germa tv germa 985 tv tv's yeah uh oh so much more goes into tv i i would rather
[19609.55s -> 19616.54s]  just make a few phone calls and say here's an idea that i want to do let's make it happen
[19616.99s -> 19624.30s]  from my channel not for anybody else's i'd rather do that than have like a tv show which this is so
[19624.30s -> 19630.91s]  much more goes into that i'm happy that you liked it i'm glad that you enjoyed it i'm glad that
[19630.91s -> 19636.74s]  people thought it was fun and i'm glad you got to at least win some of the games because i really
[19636.74s -> 19642.77s]  was concerned that you weren't going to do any of them but you did almost all of them i don't think
[19642.77s -> 19649.01s]  there was actually that that kind of knocked the clowns down uh you only got two or three of those
[19649.09s -> 19656.21s]  but i guess that you got the the pain so that was enough for a uh a painful hurt myself dab so
[19656.21s -> 19660.67s]  that's all right you didn't do the first one that's right the bottle did you no you didn't do the
[19660.67s -> 19671.62s]  bottles ring toss no you didn't do ring toss right oh shit you guys didn't do ring toss oh well

[20046.77s -> 20054.70s]  more proud of it thank you uh yes it's only happened like two or three times it's happened
[20054.70s -> 20064.85s]  i think three times total in places that i you wouldn't think i've got recognized i've got
[20064.85s -> 20074.54s]  recognized in a mall before walking around a mall it was just and you know you know and you you know
[20074.54s -> 20079.02s]  right you walk it around you know you walk by somebody you make the kind of like just like

[20111.50s -> 20118.14s]  at a convention though something like twitchcon or pax or blizzcon it's happened maybe a dozen
[20118.14s -> 20123.10s]  times or so on the show floor people just kind of walk by you and they go hey and i go hey
[20124.14s -> 20133.30s]  and it happens there and that's fun a dozen yeah it happened a dozen times no i i very much enjoy

[20188.03s -> 20195.04s]  that clown car was very very inexpensive it just needed a little bit of spray paint

[21050.42s -> 21056.88s]  really really funny contest set up some type of competition or contest or something and that
[21056.88s -> 21068.43s]  person wins a a private full live stream that would be so awkward yeah i mean it it kind of would
[21070.46s -> 21074.86s]  but that make it's making me laugh right now so i think it's something i want to explore
[21076.77s -> 21084.58s]  i don't think i could handle that what if they don't show up you know i all right i'm gonna
[21084.58s -> 21092.02s]  tell you this because there's no way it's gonna happen ever that's not true though i have to
[21092.02s -> 21103.09s]  hold on to so many ideas that i if i ever use them i can't let them out but when am i gonna
[21103.09s -> 21112.48s]  have time to do this though that's impossible i can't no i can't just in case years down the
[21112.48s -> 21122.74s]  road this is something that i do i can't you know i think there's one person that knows about this
[21124.74s -> 21135.55s]  maybe like two is lucratius here is luke here lucratius definitely not eu i think lucratius
[21135.55s -> 21146.59s]  is the only person that knows about this idea and they have been sworn to secrecy it's pretty
[21146.59s -> 21153.79s]  good though i'm not gonna lie it's pretty good it's something i've no it's nothing i've never
[21153.79s -> 21161.09s]  talked of uh so far no it's nothing that you've ever heard of before i've never talked about it
[21162.69s -> 21166.61s]  but we can move on we're uh we gotta end the stream here i didn't think i was gonna go for
[21166.61s -> 21169.97s]  seven hours but i haven't been i've been i haven't been around for like a week so
[21171.47s -> 21176.62s]  i'm cool to hang out and chill for a little bit so it's fine he just said you can tell us
[21181.65s -> 21190.18s]  no no it's not even it's not it's not gonna happen but there's no way to live again out of
[21190.18s -> 21204.90s]  me or lucratius what it is three hours of game four hours of chill yeah sometimes it's like that
[21204.90s -> 21216.67s]  though i'm okay with that sometimes but snoozing coffee thanks for the 250 hi germa the carnival
[21216.67s -> 21221.34s]  stream was exceptional i cannot wait to see what else you have in store for us in the future you're
[21221.34s -> 21228.54s]  the greatest thank you really and now to something else i'm on vacation in dallas and currently got
[21228.54s -> 21234.67s]  hit by a car on sunday that's not good i was on one of those electrical scooters in a car capped
[21234.67s -> 21244.05s]  me from behind well the mirror did holy shit i got away with a big bruise and some scrapes so i got
[21244.05s -> 21250.42s]  pretty surreal though you ever had any big accidents or injuries i've never been i never
[21250.42s -> 21259.31s]  been hit by a car like that before that sounds horrifying hopefully you're all right big bruise
[21259.31s -> 21269.49s]  and some scrapes thankfully but i've been i've had car accidents before i don't know if i've
[21269.49s -> 21274.75s]  ever told you this one time one time i got the worst car accident i was ever in in my whole life
[21274.75s -> 21285.12s]  was i was at a red light just sitting at a red light and somebody drove into the back of my car
[21285.12s -> 21293.50s]  going 40 or 50 miles per hour and and it was in it was horrible they just weren't paying attention
[21293.50s -> 21298.18s]  i was sitting at a stoplight for probably 10 seconds and this person i don't know what they
[21298.18s -> 21304.61s]  were doing i don't know what happened but holy shit they i thought my car exploded i'm just sitting
[21304.61s -> 21311.47s]  there at the light and then boom i thought i was like the car i was a car had to exploded it had
[21311.47s -> 21320.50s]  to have right how else would that have happened that was the scariest thing that was probably top
[21320.50s -> 21340.56s]  five scariest things in my entire life that was in my car was totaled that was it what's top what's
[21340.56s -> 21352.03s]  number one i i don't know i'm just saying that's up there somewhere i don't know what could possibly
[21352.03s -> 21361.68s]  be top above that um let me think what could possibly be above that i don't know that's why
[21361.68s -> 21372.64s]  i put i said it was somewhere in the top five it could be number one no this there's other
[21374.13s -> 21383.10s]  dangerous awful shit i'm trying to think like of my whole life i don't know i it's up there
[21383.10s -> 21386.46s]  somewhere i know i know there's other stuff that's happened that i could put up there
[21392.96s -> 21397.74s]  no no no there's more but now that's probably number one now that i'm really sitting here
[21397.74s -> 21406.22s]  thinking about it i just remember i don't i it's like when something like that happens to you
[21408.58s -> 21420.61s]  i can remember every second of that experience that's how crazy our brains are i can't tell
[21420.61s -> 21428.16s]  you what i had for dinner two days ago but i remember every second of that car accident
[21435.50s -> 21442.56s]  but man yeah i i don't want to go into like obviously grisly details but that was that
[21442.56s -> 21452.02s]  screwed me up for a little while it was really really fucked up but i was all right i was okay
[21452.02s -> 21459.41s]  the way that the car hit me the guy flipped over so he actually flipped over the right side of the
[21459.41s -> 21463.33s]  car and i think they were they were in like an suv so that's horrible because i was in like a
[21463.33s -> 21470.59s]  little tiny little i was like a chevy or something trying to remember what the car was yeah no it
[21470.59s -> 21479.33s]  was ridiculous and it was on one of the busiest roads too one of the busiest just actual roads
[21479.33s -> 21486.00s]  it was fucking crazy and i remember just getting out of the car and looking at this
[21486.00s -> 21492.24s]  what was left of my vehicle the whole back was crushed in and the whole right side passenger
[21492.24s -> 21499.01s]  was all messed up too and all i could think of over and over again was going thank god there was
[21499.01s -> 21504.61s]  nobody in my car thank god i wasn't driving anybody anywhere thank god i didn't i wasn't
[21504.61s -> 21517.14s]  with any friends or anything i was just alone so thank god you see people need to understand
[21517.30s -> 21526.64s]  power of a fucking car yeah and cars cars are dangerous man people you gotta be careful you
[21526.64s -> 21535.14s]  see people flying around driving like assholes like you gotta be fucking careful man seeing
[21535.14s -> 21539.70s]  people going 10 20 miles per hour over the speed limit and shit it's like just you gotta fucking
[21539.70s -> 21552.80s]  relax like what are you doing see people going there's just whizzing by going like 50 in a 30
[21552.80s -> 21563.36s]  it's just like what are you what are you thinking vegas has some bad driving nah no they do people
[21563.36s -> 21576.82s]  gotta just relax a little bit you don't gotta you don't gotta go that fast that's why i don't
[21576.82s -> 21585.55s]  drive anymore i walk i take public transport if i have to yeah i could i'm trust me i get it
[21585.55s -> 21594.96s]  he was gonna be he's gotta be more careful i don't know why some people just think they're
[21594.96s -> 21607.36s]  invincible in that thing you're not let me make that really clear you aren't that's kim say it's
[21607.36s -> 21614.29s]  worse than boston yeah we've been we've been on the highway before just driving and kim and i will
[21614.29s -> 21622.02s]  just be driving and all of a sudden you'll just see somebody just just going like and there are
[21622.02s -> 21625.86s]  other cars on the road too you've got like two three four five other cars in the lanes on the
[21625.86s -> 21630.50s]  highway and they just changing lanes back and forth back and forth left right right right left
[21630.50s -> 21638.11s]  right it's just dude what are you doing what are you thinking there's no reason to go that fast
[21638.91s -> 21645.09s]  look we're all going to baskin robbins they're still going to be open don't what are you doing
[21649.76s -> 21662.40s]  people just drive so fucking fast i don't understand it they close at eight on sunday
[21668.02s -> 21672.90s]  you say yeah and and the and the worst part about it then this is this is real talk right here
[21673.86s -> 21679.23s]  you know it really really irritates me in a car so if you're driving and you're on a road let's say
[21679.23s -> 21684.99s]  the road is 40 miles per hour okay and you know you're going 40 you're going you know i'm going
[21684.99s -> 21693.07s]  38 40 41 42 and 40 going 40 39 right okay all right okay settle down right cool
[21695.36s -> 21703.52s]  once you have somebody that passes you that's going like 60 in that 40 and then you go up to
[21703.52s -> 21711.17s]  the light that is less than a mile ahead of where you are and that person you look over to your left
[21711.17s -> 21722.70s]  and they're at the same light as you it's like you got real far didn't you think what you didn't
[21722.70s -> 21732.19s]  gain any time haven't you read the tortoise and the hare they wrote that fucking book like 75
[21732.19s -> 21738.67s]  years ago and it still rings true you're not gonna win a race it's we're just going to the
[21738.67s -> 21757.39s]  you're i you're not making time he's doing splits i that always just that just grinds me i get so
[21757.39s -> 21764.21s]  irritated i'm just like come on just think of like the danger that you're putting your fellow
[21764.21s -> 21770.11s]  drivers in and and even yourself for you to look over and see the guy that you passed at the red
[21770.11s -> 21776.05s]  light should be like an internal scenario where you go okay i'm kind of fucking up here i kind
[21776.05s -> 21793.30s]  of probably should think about what i'm doing people people are stupid yeah but i'm i'm just
[21793.30s -> 21805.22s]  venting at this point i'm just venting about drivers defensive driving is mandatory yeah it's
[21805.22s -> 21814.42s]  a temporary lack of empathy or consideration i i mean even i just don't want to get a car accident
[21814.98s -> 21822.14s]  i don't want to get in a car accident if i go 20 miles per hour over the speed limit i am
[21822.14s -> 21829.02s]  exponentially increasing the chances that i'm going to get into a car accident by tenfold why
[21829.02s -> 21842.80s]  do i want that should it be harder to get a driver's license i don't know if it should
[21842.80s -> 21851.55s]  be harder to get a driver's license or if we should i don't know what the answer is i think
[21851.55s -> 21858.80s]  people just like systematically need to get like taught fucking manners i don't know like that's
[21858.80s -> 21878.88s]  kind of what it is learn manners well because you don't cut the person off unless you you know
[21878.88s -> 21885.55s]  unless you just be kind of being a dick i can i can look if somebody if the speed limit is like
[21885.55s -> 21891.07s]  30 miles per hour and somebody's going like 20 like 25 it's like okay you're going slow here
[21891.07s -> 21897.54s]  you're going really slow if there's a passing lane then you're okay whatever but if somebody
[21897.54s -> 21905.79s]  like me i go the speed limit i do i go i go like within five miles per hour of the speed limit
[21905.79s -> 21912.98s]  whether that's okay it's a 30 i'm going like 30 like between like 28 and like 32
[21912.98s -> 21925.23s]  right i try to stay within about five miles per hour the speed limit plus or minus five yeah once
[21925.23s -> 21929.47s]  you start to get over about five miles per hour over the speed limit you really want to you don't
[21929.47s -> 21935.06s]  you want to slow down i'd say it like three or four miles per hour over is when i start to go okay i'm
[21935.06s -> 21950.53s]  going to pull it back a little miles per hour yeah which we are we are talking american in here
[21950.53s -> 21971.84s]  32 slow down there you're crazy 32 you know when it's a 35 i like to go my age 34
[21971.84s -> 21981.60s]  but there are smart ways to to drive the speed limit if you're gonna go more than 20 plus miles
[21981.60s -> 21985.92s]  per hour for the speed limit you are just putting everybody in danger and it's just not that's not
[21986.00s -> 21995.82s]  cool that's a real monka s like don't do that that's just fucking reckless and people do it
[21995.82s -> 22003.44s]  all the time but i consider and talk about how people driving around like assholes is annoying
[22003.44s -> 22012.40s]  for the next two hours we are getting close to the end here don't even know how we got there but we

[22480.98s -> 22488.66s]  on the scooter and stand there wait for the app to authorize it wait what you do stand there and

[22594.03s -> 22597.95s]  thanks for the 250 somebody said the stream's been over for two hours sometimes it happens like this
[22597.95s -> 22604.14s]  usually this is about 30 to 40 minutes somewhere between 30 plus minutes or so but i've been gone
[22604.14s -> 22611.22s]  for a long time but thank you mostly lost for the 250 hey jeremy i was driving through dallas the

[22649.26s -> 22658.16s]  they use the bike lane you got to be careful with cyclists though some cyclists are really really
[22658.16s -> 22664.62s]  really good and really smart sometimes sometimes that cyclist doesn't have reflective gear on
[22664.62s -> 22670.22s]  sometimes that cyclist is kind of just riding their bike on the road you've got to be careful
[22671.02s -> 22697.14s]  especially at night you share the road and if you're a cyclist you know you got to share the
[22697.14s -> 22702.58s]  road too we're all just we're all just trying to get to fucking baskin robbins all of us
