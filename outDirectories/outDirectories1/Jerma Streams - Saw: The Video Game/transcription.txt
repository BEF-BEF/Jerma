[0.82s -> 6.78s]  Don't let him. Don't let him get away with this. Don't let him get away. He's not here. He was
[6.78s -> 13.83s]  here 45 seconds after he said he was gonna be. Don't let him get away with this. Controller.
[15.82s -> 30.57s]  Hi everybody. Can't get away with it. Welcome back to another unfilled few days coming up here.
[34.36s -> 43.00s]  Move some stuff. Did that tweet go through? Did you see it? What's wrong with my audio?
[43.96s -> 51.18s]  Uh, what's wrong? What's wrong with your audio? Go in the back of your speakers and grab that
[51.18s -> 60.38s]  little cord that connects to your headphones or whatever and just you'll get it. This is not like
[60.38s -> 75.99s]  an AM radio station but man it might work. Touch that dial now. Where's the baking stream? Uh,
[75.99s -> 87.05s]  Friday. Easy Bake Oven Stream is Friday. Green Screen DLC for free is Saturday. What's wrong
[87.05s -> 97.03s]  with your face? I don't know. Nothing. It's perfect. Just the way that God made me.
[98.18s -> 114.71s]  Okay? God gave me this big bump in my nose and that's the way that he created me. Don't blame
[114.71s -> 121.48s]  that shit on God. And then all of a sudden I get interrupted. Excuse me. No, no. That's not how it
[121.48s -> 130.44s]  happened actually. I gave you a perfectly sculpted nose and you broke it on a trampoline. You jumped
[130.44s -> 133.72s]  on a trampoline and landed on your back and your knees came back and hit you in the face
[134.44s -> 149.54s]  and broke your nose. I was perfect. That's kind of what happened actually. Real story. Add it to
[149.54s -> 158.81s]  the wiki. I could say anything and you guys would add it to the wiki? Okay. How about um, I was,
[158.81s -> 175.35s]  okay, I was born with an extra pair of hands. I had 20 fingers. Okay. That's all that. I was
[175.43s -> 183.50s]  gonna put it on there. We knew that already. It's already there. It's just there already.
[184.14s -> 188.78s]  Now we're gonna play Saw today. I know people, we were in the pre-stream chat talking about this
[188.78s -> 193.74s]  and it was like, what are we gonna do today? It was a one-guy opportunity but I didn't see
[193.74s -> 202.60s]  any that I didn't want to, I didn't take any one-guy opportunity of. Does this game suck?
[203.94s -> 214.04s]  That's, that's my question. We got the illusion of choice. No, you got the reality of suggestion.
[214.84s -> 230.65s]  I will take your suggestions but that doesn't mean I'm gonna do them. Hurry up and stream the
[230.65s -> 239.59s]  fucking game. It's been four minutes. I'm just, I am one of the only people on this website and
[239.59s -> 244.63s]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna toot my own horn. I'm one of the only damn people on this website that starts
[244.63s -> 250.15s]  their stream within like five minutes of pressing the fucking button, okay? So give me a little bit
[250.15s -> 260.06s]  of that slack. I deserve it. I deserve that and I just got a bunch of money. Holy shit. I deserve it.
[262.70s -> 268.86s]  No, but for real, I may, I may start my streams late but when I turn, when I hit that fucking
[268.86s -> 275.10s]  button, we go within five minutes. I know a lot of people on this website give you like a 20 to 30
[275.10s -> 278.62s]  minute window at the beginning where they turn their streams on. Like some people have like a
[278.62s -> 288.84s]  15, 20, 30, 40 minute intro and that's how they run their business. But I run my business, you know,
[288.84s -> 299.22s]  with wrappers open and ice cream half eaten and shit. The prices are very low. Uh, Freddy gave 50
[299.22s -> 314.50s]  subs. 50 community subs from Freddy Dredd. Freddy's back again. Derma sucks lol. What the fuck?
[317.88s -> 322.12s]  I seriously wonder what would happen in this community. If you don't, we're gonna do an
[322.12s -> 327.90s]  experiment one day. I'm not gonna tell you when, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna see. I'm gonna have a
[327.90s -> 336.44s]  starting soon screen that has like a 25 minute countdown. I wonder how many of you guys would,
[336.44s -> 346.20s]  at like the 18 minute mark, I'm just gonna crack and be like, where is he? Where is he? Get up!
[350.04s -> 363.45s]  Give me the stream. I'd crack at 28. Yeah, you'd crack at the one minute mark. Roast him. Roast him.
[363.45s -> 370.02s]  Roast him. Why am I, don't roast me. What did I do? But Freddy, seriously, that's another fucking
[370.02s -> 379.37s]  50 community subs. It's insane. What do you say we get started? Hey, it's been, it's been exactly
[379.37s -> 385.45s]  seven minutes since I've pressed the stream button. And uh, what was that? Oh look, right here, right
[385.45s -> 400.17s]  here. I'm ready. Okay, here we go. New game, let's go. I don't know who, wait, what is this?
[400.17s -> 409.46s]  Why are you linking me to this? I don't know who Derma95 is and thanks to this game, I never want
[409.46s -> 424.78s]  to know. Oh, uh, Space Form Derma Slots is a slots game, like the strip slot son, what?
[426.58s -> 433.70s]  Midi game, ignore it. Yeah, whatever. Well, what do you want me to do? This is, if somebody has an
[433.70s -> 441.14s]  opinion on something, whatever. You can't expect every person that ever, well, hold on a minute,
[441.14s -> 444.98s]  this person doesn't understand every single reference that's ever been made on this stream?
[445.78s -> 449.94s]  He has not had the countless amount of experiences that we've had. I'm just like a,
[449.94s -> 456.68s]  I'm just a dickhead on his stream, uh, his steam recommended list. Like imagine seeing that Derma
[456.68s -> 460.28s]  Life is Pain face and clicking on that and being like, who is this fucking person? I don't give a
[460.28s -> 483.06s]  shit about this guy. What do you want me to do? It's whatever. It's, you can't have people like
[483.06s -> 489.61s]  just every single ever experience that I ever have with another person online. He's gonna,
[489.61s -> 496.22s]  somebody's not going to be happy. It's fine. It's all right. Just wait till they see this,
[496.22s -> 500.54s]  when they see the shpee video and I guarantee you, they'll be fucking, they'll be on board.
[502.07s -> 510.71s]  Where's the, where's the scary game? Scary cam? No, no, I'm not doing, there's no, but this is not
[510.71s -> 526.82s]  a scary game. Like the audio settings, let's run with the audio setting. Is that like, give me an A,
[527.78s -> 544.44s]  give me a B. What's that spell? This is like a, what should I do? Which one of these,
[547.24s -> 550.60s]  I already like put, I just come in and I go like this and then I start the game.
[553.53s -> 564.74s]  Let him out. Help him. I don't know where he is. It's me. I think it's me. This is fine. No,
[564.74s -> 573.91s]  I hate, I don't want the music. Five. All right. You guys ready? Wait, I have to one, two, three,
[573.91s -> 578.31s]  four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Hold on. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[578.31s -> 584.23s]  nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. Is it synced? One, two, three, four, five, six,
[584.23s -> 596.18s]  seven, eight, nine, ten. Is it synced? Good. You should be seeing it. Okay. We're good.
[596.18s -> 601.46s]  All right. Let's go. This game's, I'm not, this game, we're going to be done in probably like 10
[601.46s -> 615.66s]  minutes. Normal or insane mode? I don't want to play this game on insane. Why would I pick insane?
[617.24s -> 623.24s]  No, we're doing some fucking, we're doing some normal. Some clues are revealed in the dark.
[623.24s -> 634.17s]  $50, $100. Holy shit. Hold on. Every choice has a consequence. Wait, there's consequences? Is
[634.17s -> 651.69s]  this like a bad, is this like a gory game? It's a telltale game. It's Saw. Yeah, but it's
[651.69s -> 657.75s]  Saw the video game. That doesn't follow the movies. Like SpongeBob Battle for the Bikini
[657.75s -> 665.02s]  Bottom was not based on a SpongeBob episode. They just made a game. Wait, this does happen
[665.02s -> 711.24s]  in the movie. Looks like this is keyed in. Okay. So get the key that's in your eyeball.
[712.12s -> 733.58s]  Here's what happens. Whoa. It's waiting for one of these times that he like kind of
[733.58s -> 738.86s]  forgets the key. He's just sitting right on the table. He's watching. He's like, oh shit.
[740.47s -> 745.18s]  Oh wow. There's like 40 more people in other rooms. I'm doing it. Left stick.
[746.30s -> 758.10s]  Wait, do I have a key? Wait, what am I supposed to be doing? Press B. Oh, I pressed B.
[759.06s -> 766.07s]  It's a QTE. I don't have an Xbox controller, man. What the fuck?
[783.66s -> 791.29s]  Escape the bathroom. There it is. Okay. Wait, should I look at the things in the ground? What's
[791.29s -> 802.49s]  that? Have you a health bar in this game? What are you fucking even doing this game? Wait.
[811.48s -> 818.52s]  One, three. I just figured out a puzzle. One, three, four. Okay. I just didn't even mean to do that.
[819.69s -> 827.70s]  Wait, no. Four, one, four, three. What is this? This isn't doing something else. What is this
[827.70s -> 846.30s]  doing? Four, three. Why is it doing this? Four, three, seven. Four, three, seven. Okay. Four,
[846.30s -> 857.85s]  three, seven. That's a puzzle. He definitely rushed this one. Like this game, I guess it takes place
[857.85s -> 862.44s]  after Jigsaw went public and now he's got to keep his like share prices up and he's
[862.44s -> 866.04s]  got to continuously grow and shit and you got to get like, it's got to be 100 people a day.
[866.76s -> 884.44s]  Also, this can't be fucking that good. Find Jigsaw's next clue. This game suck. Wait,
[884.44s -> 889.91s]  I just went in here. Oh, detective. Turns out you're a fucking idiot. You went back in the
[889.91s -> 906.17s]  room that you escaped from. This is an ugly screen. Anyone out there? Help. Oh, no. That's
[906.17s -> 932.07s]  my room. All right. Hold on. I've got to look for achievements. What just happened? Co-op.
[932.79s -> 958.47s]  That's easy. You just gave me the solution. Well, what is his task? You have to dig through
[958.47s -> 967.78s]  needles. You have to stand there and be scared. What do you mean teamwork? Well, which one is it?
[967.78s -> 972.82s]  Do we have a timer? We have a timer. One hour and two. We've got an hour and 20 minutes, man. Just
[972.82s -> 983.59s]  relax. Wait, it's okay. Hold on. You are trapped. Search the toilet for the fuse before you pass out
[983.59s -> 989.11s]  from pain. What? What do you mean? Then use the fuse on the fuse box to power the door. Press the
[989.11s -> 1002.49s]  green button to open the door. How do I search the grab? What the fuck? Did I get it? You know,
[1003.45s -> 1010.60s]  I got it. You have a fuse. You can use it to activate a fuse box. Turning on a fuse box will
[1010.60s -> 1015.08s]  power a door. Turn on lights or even create a deadly electrical trap for your enemies.
[1015.72s -> 1018.52s]  Once the electricity is on, watch out for nearby puddles of water.
[1018.76s -> 1033.32s]  Okay, I did it. Why are there enemies? Classifies as an enemy in a saw game.
[1035.32s -> 1044.76s]  All right, we're good. Come open the door. That was a record time. Wow, that was a good guess.
[1054.34s -> 1057.22s]  You have bare feet. Certain hazards in the environment will injure you like a broken
[1057.22s -> 1067.61s]  glass ahead. Okay. So I climb on box. Like just jump to that and climb on it and just shimmy over
[1067.61s -> 1080.46s]  there or just lie on your back and just earthworm backwards slowly. That work? Why can't I just
[1081.18s -> 1094.90s]  jump on that? Do like cats do? Wait, that didn't even hurt. It's not really a hazard then. Okay,
[1094.90s -> 1106.15s]  just to be aware of that. I'm gonna step in that all fucking day. All right, what's in here? Do I
[1106.15s -> 1112.04s]  need to do anything or does it not matter? This door is sealed, right? This is just a game where
[1112.04s -> 1121.45s]  you do QTEs and like watch people get their heads ripped off and shit. Health hypo. Okay. Press and
[1121.45s -> 1125.61s]  hold X to use a health hypodermic. These will restore your health. The longer you hold down X,
[1125.61s -> 1137.78s]  the more health will be restored. Okay. Cool. Thanks. Let there be light. Press Y to turn on
[1137.78s -> 1141.62s]  your light. Right now you have a lighter. Other light sources can be found and each is unique.
[1143.26s -> 1149.98s]  First of all, hold on a minute. I got $100 from Pluto passing by and then $50 from Koike. So I
[1149.98s -> 1154.07s]  want to make sure I address that because there's a lot of fucking money. Pluto passing by gave
[1154.07s -> 1158.63s]  10,000 bits, a hundred fucking dollars. Jeremy, it's my 21st birthday today. Here's some birthday
[1158.63s -> 1165.22s]  bits. Thanks for making me laugh. Love you and chat. Thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.
[1165.86s -> 1178.76s]  No, no birthday face cam. I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen. Happy 21st milestone for you living
[1178.76s -> 1188.92s]  in America. Nice job. Nice job. Nice job. What am I? What do I mean? Nice job. Nice job on
[1188.92s -> 1195.34s]  getting there, I guess. What do you mean? Nice job. Like he didn't turn in his paper early.
[1195.34s -> 1202.26s]  Oh, wow. You turned in your thesis like two days early. Nice job. Nice work. I mean, still,
[1203.22s -> 1209.48s]  Jeremy, you still got it. Oh, I wanted to talk about this. This fucking reminds me.
[1209.48s -> 1217.11s]  I actually was looking at my degree the other day. And in the in the I was going through some
[1217.11s -> 1221.51s]  personal files that I had to I wanted to get situated because obviously I moved.
[1222.15s -> 1227.51s]  And I got my full every class I've ever taken in every grade I've ever gotten in college.
[1227.51s -> 1239.22s]  And you want to know something funny? I got an F in pickleball. I swear I got a fucking F and
[1239.22s -> 1246.44s]  poke. I don't even know how I could prove it. I could. I have the document. I got a file. I
[1246.44s -> 1253.16s]  got an F. I don't know how. How do you get an F in pickleball? What do I do? I just not go.
[1253.16s -> 1259.98s]  I have no idea. We could go all of my grades. I got like an F in like a media class. I don't
[1259.98s -> 1266.70s]  even know how I got like a D my one of my GPA was. All right. This is important. I know I got a game
[1266.70s -> 1272.14s]  to play. What do you guys think my cumulative cumulative whatever that fucking hard to say
[1272.14s -> 1283.62s]  word is? What's my what was my GPA? What was it over the course of the whole time I was in college?
[1283.62s -> 1291.77s]  Since it's lower than four. I can tell you that it's lower than three. I can tell you that it is
[1291.77s -> 1298.26s]  higher than two and is lower than three. One point eight. You can't I don't think you can even
[1298.26s -> 1306.18s]  graduate with like a one point five. Right. Two point six. You got it. Two six. I don't even know
[1306.18s -> 1315.82s]  what that is. That's like a C. Right. Like a C plus something like that. But because I would get
[1315.82s -> 1322.82s]  A's in some classes and then I would get F's in classes that I just didn't give a shit about.
[1322.82s -> 1326.98s]  It's bad. I know. Like I was either I was either I got it like an A minus or an F.
[1326.98s -> 1335.02s]  So it evened out over the years. I got a I got a light. But anyways thanks for the hundred fucking
[1335.02s -> 1338.70s]  bucks. Also Goiki thanks for the fifty dollars. Jeremy hello again. I'm excited for this game
[1338.70s -> 1343.34s]  because I like the movie even though it's shit. All of chat saying this game is shit too but I
[1343.34s -> 1350.46s]  don't care. I'm excited. Me too. You should be. I got an F in pickleball. I'm trying to go through
[1350.46s -> 1355.02s]  my brain as to where why and how that happened. That was supposed to scare me but it was too late.
[1356.57s -> 1368.65s]  That's supposed to fall when I first walk over here. But I don't say anything.
[1368.65s -> 1392.38s]  But I have a key. I have the key. Here we go. It's gonna be another door closed. You don't walk in
[1392.38s -> 1397.34s]  this room. You know what you do here. You just stand right here and you peek in the room to
[1397.34s -> 1402.06s]  trigger the infrared beam that triggers when somebody comes in to try to close the door.
[1402.06s -> 1417.03s]  Peek in. Get the fuck out. And the door will slam. Bolt it shut. Wait what. Okay well oh yeah.
[1417.67s -> 1423.00s]  Why can you do this? All right go on.
[1445.29s -> 1450.86s]  Uh oh. You know how much of a pain in the ass it would be to have these
[1450.86s -> 1454.22s]  old TVs. Why do they have to be fucking old TVs? That's one thing I don't understand about how our
[1454.22s -> 1458.70s]  movies officially saw. Why isn't there like a flat screen back there? They're cheaper. You know how
[1458.78s -> 1466.41s]  hard. You know how expensive this probably is to get to work. Like this shit wasn't like this
[1467.05s -> 1470.73s]  like three days ago. He came down and like put a bunch of trash down here and like painted blood
[1470.73s -> 1477.29s]  on the walls and stuff. It wasn't like this down here. This is a huge project. Will you appreciate
[1477.29s -> 1502.97s]  your life? Sure. It's his craft. Wait what. Is this a game where I'm gonna get chased by a monster?
[1503.69s -> 1513.43s]  It's not right? Uh somebody else will read this. Construction has completed on Whitehurst. Asylum
[1513.43s -> 1518.71s]  for the insane. We've finally done it. I'm told all the staff has it at nauseam and somebody
[1518.71s -> 1526.15s]  else will read this. Actually it's not that long. It's okay. I think we can make a real difference
[1526.15s -> 1541.43s]  here. Whatever somebody will read this. I can't. How do I really get chased around? How many of
[1541.43s -> 1552.30s]  these things exist? You don't do this by yourself. One guy in his like 70s is supposed to be
[1552.30s -> 1582.39s]  able to do this. This is like a two to three hundred person project. Find the key to his
[1584.49s -> 1600.92s]  search the body. Saved a woman in the surgical theater. Okay. All right. Read file. Read the
[1600.92s -> 1610.90s]  puzzle pieces. Oh sorry. Nothing personal. I'd grab something quick though if I was you.
[1610.90s -> 1615.06s]  What are you talking about? You don't say sorry and then do it again.
[1616.02s -> 1622.31s]  Do I have my arm going? He hit my arm off. He took my arm off with a swing of the bat.
[1623.03s -> 1626.95s]  Combat stance. Hold the left trigger to enter combat stance with either your fist or a weapon.
[1627.75s -> 1636.12s]  Press A for a light attack and X for okay. A and X. Block with the B button. Okay.
[1636.92s -> 1653.98s]  Fucking hit him. Put the lighter down. Are you fucking serious dude? How did you miss? You missed?
[1654.86s -> 1671.72s]  How are you a detective? He punched through it. You can't block a fucking. Swing. Swing. Swing.
[1677.32s -> 1692.79s]  Oh my god. That's like scripted. Wait. Huh? What do you mean?
[1692.87s -> 1698.30s]  Did I not make it? Wait. Are you serious?
[1704.47s -> 1718.84s]  There was no autosave anywhere from that point forward. Okay. No way. What? No checkpoint?
[1720.06s -> 1723.66s]  All right. I'm gonna. Let's go. I gotta play this game. You think I'm not gonna fucking play this
[1723.66s -> 1736.20s]  game? I can't believe there's no fucking save. X. Come on. Hurry up.
[1743.74s -> 1750.71s]  It was four, three, seven. We don't even need to listen. Imagine. Oh detective. It's time for you
[1750.71s -> 1766.82s]  to play again. I got the door open. Wait. I. How did you do that? Not done being scary. Yep. Yep.
[1766.82s -> 1792.94s]  Yep. I know. Help. Somebody help me. Holy shit. What happened? Dude. I know. All right. Get up.
[1794.58s -> 1812.01s]  What does give up do? I wonder. Put it in. Put it in. I think that's locked until one minute.
[1815.11s -> 1817.99s]  You can't beat that within the minute. It's locked until exactly one minute.
[1824.71s -> 1830.01s]  Don't walk on it. Fuck. Whatever. I'm strong. Okay. We're good. Take it all.
[1830.65s -> 1840.71s]  Oh yeah. Yeah. Hold X. It's dark in here. If we get up quickly, this just happens.
[1841.35s -> 1846.97s]  Because yeah. This is guy. Scary. We don't even need to watch this. We already watched it.
[1847.69s -> 1866.23s]  Who cares what I mean? You know, we kind of, well, let's might as well. I get that. Okay. Don't
[1866.23s -> 1891.54s]  fucking lose here. I don't care. I still, that's a loud TV. Save. What do you mean save? Where?
[1892.10s -> 1912.86s]  How do I save? There is no save. What are you talking about? Save. It's too early to save.
[1913.58s -> 1924.74s]  Okay. Yep. Yeah. There you are. I'm going to save you. All right. Here we go. This is sealed. Wait,
[1924.74s -> 1934.58s]  is this timed when this actually, did I miss a trigger point here? Did I not look down here?
[1935.14s -> 1943.53s]  Did I go too fast? Did I break the game because the TV kept playing? I didn't, right? Now that
[1943.53s -> 1959.06s]  this door is sealed, there's no way. It's probably timed. You went too, I went too fast. I did. No,
[1959.06s -> 1981.34s]  I didn't. What the fuck did I just do? Did I just take a heal? She's dead. I stopped doing drugs.
[1983.62s -> 2002.95s]  Wait, audio tape. Oh, come on. All right. Let's go. Where is he? All right. Press A for a light
[2002.95s -> 2019.61s]  attack and X for a heavy attack. Block with B. Counter attack. What? He's got me cornered.
[2020.33s -> 2051.43s]  Dude, this game doesn't make any sense. Attack. Attack. A. A. I am holding the trigger. It takes
[2051.43s -> 2065.93s]  so long to cue up a swing. That was before you realized there was a bomb in your brain
[2067.59s -> 2071.69s]  that only would activate if you said that you were going to leave
[2072.33s -> 2075.59s]  on a twist, on a twist, just like all the other ones we do.
[2076.23s -> 2094.23s]  Many of you are, somebody will read this. Wait, find detective David Tapp. I've concealed a key
[2094.23s -> 2130.30s]  inside his body. Wait, many of you will want, hold on. I can do better than this. I can do better.
[2130.78s -> 2147.37s]  All right. Let's go in here. Door's sealed. All right. Let's heal. That was completely
[2147.37s -> 2154.68s]  incomprehensible. All right. I got the door open. Save. When does this game auto save?
[2154.68s -> 2162.44s]  I'm just walking on fucking glass. God damn it. Is there more glass? Shotgun doors. Jigsaw has
[2162.44s -> 2167.40s]  booby trap doors in the asylum. Quickly press the appropriate button as the bullet descends.
[2167.40s -> 2171.16s]  If you press the wrong button or fail to press the right button, you will be on the receiving end
[2171.16s -> 2193.67s]  of a shotgun blast. Oh, great. Can I go in? Some locked doors can be picked with items around the
[2193.67s -> 2204.58s]  world or unlock. I need a pin. I need a screw. I don't want to go in here. Wait, isn't there a lady?
[2226.04s -> 2249.78s]  What the hell was that?
[2258.39s -> 2272.44s]  I can't understand. Too much. Too much. Hold on. Let me monitor. Let me hold on. What does it sound
[2272.44s -> 2276.76s]  like? Repeat that. How bad is it? I know I was like kind of having a funny little joke there, but like
[2280.89s -> 2293.26s]  let's see. This is really bad. It's just like a cell phone dropped call. You can't even hear
[2293.34s -> 2330.63s]  fucking anything. Hold on. This is, no, this just sounds weird. This just makes me sound like,
[2331.35s -> 2334.87s]  you know, here's the thing. The thing about this that I want to really talk about, this is
[2335.43s -> 2339.99s]  welcome to every single, every single talk ADM radio station that you've ever listened to in
[2339.99s -> 2345.67s]  your whole life. And they think they have the audacity to bring everybody back in here and
[2345.67s -> 2354.01s]  talk to this. Yeah. I gotta get this right. How's this? No. How's this? No. All right. Hold on.
[2354.01s -> 2363.34s]  Make your choice. Make your, make your, make, make your, make, make your choice. Make your, make your
[2363.34s -> 2377.62s]  choice. Make your choice. Make your choice. Let me just work. This is better. Inside there's a key.
[2378.78s -> 2398.65s]  That key. There's another key. That's better. Five nights at Freddy's.
[2402.42s -> 2409.59s]  Kylo Ren. Everything. Wait, is somebody just getting drugged over there? Is drug going into
[2409.59s -> 2413.91s]  that person or something? I have to go stop the drug flow? Whatever it is. All right. I'm ready.
[2414.63s -> 2424.63s]  Guys, everything is Kylo Ren. Every, every low radio voice is Kylo Ren. Wait, pick up what?
[2424.63s -> 2430.02s]  Antigen. Health item is going to be used instantly when Tap picks the item up.
[2430.02s -> 2441.24s]  Cannot be stored in Tap's inventory like health hypos. Do a dinosaur roar. All right. I'll do,
[2441.24s -> 2454.30s]  you want me to do a dinosaur roar? And then take that and lower it because that's how they did the
[2454.30s -> 2462.97s]  T-Rex. Take that lower and add like a bunch of weird shit to it. T-Rex is like a trumpet or
[2462.97s -> 2475.43s]  something, right? Isn't the T-Rex like a trumpet or a trombone that they bucked with an elephant?
[2475.51s -> 2487.62s]  What am I thinking of? Wait, that's not what it is. What's the very, very popular, I'm doing
[2487.62s -> 2495.61s]  the T-Rex like, the T-Rex sound effect is just the Jim Carrey annoying sound that they slowed down.
[2504.76s -> 2515.37s]  All right. Where the fuck am I going? It's true. Yeah. I mean, I know. Silly streamer made a silly
[2515.37s -> 2523.83s]  noise. I need a thing to unlock this. Wait, blood. There's blood in here. There's no screws or
[2523.83s -> 2539.54s]  anything I can pick up. You have enough like a screw. I have to punch its head off. Ajax,
[2539.54s -> 2545.62s]  thanks for the five community subs. And Poofinator for the 10 community subs and my dead cat for the
[2545.62s -> 2567.70s]  10 community subs. What the fuck? That's a lot of community subs. Let's get a screw. Remember,
[2567.70s -> 2576.57s]  the screw is loose in your head. Where is this? What? I was just over here. Hold on a minute.
[2577.21s -> 2584.44s]  I opened this already and it said there's nothing in there. Fucking game sucks. Some of the doors
[2584.44s -> 2588.04s]  are rigged with lockpicking puzzles. I saw the puzzle rotate each piece to match the symbols
[2588.04s -> 2593.98s]  along the inner ring of the... I gotta pay attention. Save. There is no save. Where do you
[2593.98s -> 2601.62s]  expect me to do this? Rotate each piece to match the symbols along the inner ring of the chamber.
[2601.62s -> 2612.55s]  There is no save. There's just restore checkpoint, but that's blocked off. What the fuck is this?
[2613.11s -> 2638.18s]  What lock is this? All right. Does the game save? Where's my auto save? Save the woman in the
[2638.18s -> 2647.50s]  surgical theater. Find a key to unlock the main hallway door. Save, save, save, save. Insert your
[2647.50s -> 2659.54s]  memory card. There's a 500 gig memory card in here. Whoa. Holy shit. Let me see it. Let me see. Let
[2659.54s -> 2664.36s]  me see it. Come on. Let me see it. I haven't seen it once. What the fuck? Is this even Twitch? Is
[2664.36s -> 2669.00s]  this even a Twitch chat? Unbelievable. Thank you. What the fuck? I look like forever to see it.
[2670.04s -> 2691.59s]  Expect that every time. I'm sorry, Mr. Jigsaw. If you lock somebody in a room with barbed wire
[2691.59s -> 2698.95s]  around them and they have to like crawl out of it, the fuck are you talking about? You're just like
[2698.95s -> 2712.38s]  torturing people. Yeah, it was to symbolize their greed. Oh, so you wrapped barbed wire around their
[2712.38s -> 2720.54s]  head and put them in a giant meat grinder. Yeah, they were greedy. Oh, you feeling all right? Are
[2720.54s -> 2734.46s]  you all right? You drink water? That's perfect. That's a perfectly normal thing to do is wrap
[2734.46s -> 2740.22s]  somebody up, cut their arms and legs off, bury their head in sand, surgically implant
[2741.18s -> 2746.86s]  tubes in their body that they have to pull out and then connect to a wall. And then those tubes
[2746.86s -> 2752.70s]  then feed to another person's mouth. And yeah, the guy had insurance fraud. This might be a little
[2752.70s -> 2763.10s]  too far. Maybe now that I think about it out loud. My name is Rose. I am eight years old. My mommy
[2763.10s -> 2770.01s]  says I have polio. Polio is bad. I have it worse than Uncle Jack. He can still walk though. He seems
[2770.01s -> 2774.65s]  drunk. So I am now in this machine. A breeze spoke me so they can call it an iron lung. Her says she
[2774.65s -> 2778.81s]  will write what I say once a day so my diary doesn't forget who I am. She is my only friend.
[2779.37s -> 2800.36s]  So Jigsaw, let me get this straight. Yeah, are you talking to me? So you removed a little girl who
[2800.36s -> 2812.41s]  needed this to live to put somebody that like did heroin in it. Yes. Okay. It's your choice.
[2813.05s -> 2850.89s]  I'm going away for a fucking long time, dude. I, what's the fun of this? Who's paying the utilities?
[2852.95s -> 2863.86s]  Him? Yes, he, he made so much money that he, he, he did insurance fraud and he made $200,000 off of
[2863.86s -> 2868.26s]  other people and- Jigsaw, how much money do you have? It's not about how much money I have.
[2872.12s -> 2877.48s]  Yes, it was $6 billion to make this facility where I torture people that are bad, that we're greedy.
[2877.56s -> 2885.85s]  Jigsaw, why didn't you build like 30 schools? Well, um, because you need to be taught a lesson
[2885.85s -> 2892.70s]  and no question, you just try to get the key out of your ass. Well, I have your sternum or your eye
[2892.70s -> 2899.43s]  wherever I decided to put it. Some of you have noticed the walls starting to buckle in some areas
[2899.43s -> 2904.78s]  and have some become permeable. Please move all violent patients out of these rooms. Thus they
[2904.78s -> 2907.90s]  break down the walls to escape the construction manager. I talked to some more areas so we can
[2907.90s -> 2914.39s]  break walls. The walls in the asylum are rotted and weak. Break them open to reveal a new path.
[2916.33s -> 2925.00s]  Mr. Green is just Jigsaw. No way. I feel so strong right now.
[2928.12s -> 2944.86s]  Minecraft. Fucking Minecraft. Why? That's funny. Fuse. Okay. I got a fuse. And then can,
[2944.86s -> 2958.86s]  can the bottom drawer be opened? How do I save the game? Is there no saving? How do I save the game?
[2967.46s -> 2981.91s]  Saving is greedy. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna fucking die. What is this? The key to survival lies within.
[2983.24s -> 2999.42s]  Save the woman in the surgical theater. Find a key. Pick up the scalpel. Okay. So we get,
[3000.38s -> 3015.10s]  and what do you mean the knife will betray you? Read the toe tag. Jim Omen. Wait, do they? Hold
[3015.10s -> 3023.27s]  on. We've got like this Omen. Jay Omen doesn't have a key buried into his heart. He smoked
[3023.27s -> 3028.86s]  cigarettes. You spent years smoking cigarettes and now die with a knife from a guy that you don't
[3028.86s -> 3050.09s]  know. M. Johnson. Okay. No. Okay. A. Faulkner. Om Robinson. Arnie Faulkner. All right, Arnie.
[3050.81s -> 3081.85s]  I don't know what you did. What am I gonna get attacked? Okay. At what point do you make a
[3081.85s -> 3096.25s]  little noise and be like, you gotta give something a code, right? Like wiggle, like wiggle your toes,
[3096.25s -> 3113.54s]  like a Faulkner, right? Is the guy alive? Not anymore. What about this guy? This guy just dies.
[3114.10s -> 3145.29s]  No, he's such a fucking weirdo. I wouldn't be surprised at all if that was like,
[3145.29s -> 3151.24s]  like she was eating a lot of Oreos. I just really like Oreos. Your Oreo addiction is too much
[3152.31s -> 3183.58s]  for me to handle. The hell is this? You get it? Tech. I've determined you've had too many
[3183.58s -> 3189.99s]  Pornhub tabs open. Bolt some doors by pressing X. This will keep most enemies from opening the
[3189.99s -> 3201.78s]  door. Yeah. You're right. Pornhub tabs open. One sitting. This is unacceptable. And I'm looking
[3201.78s -> 3205.86s]  at his computer, like his computer's open. I get like into his office. He's got like 50 Pornhub
[3205.86s -> 3221.22s]  tabs open. Yeah. I can do as I say, not as I do. Right, Jigsaw? Fucking asshole. Okay. I'm getting
[3221.22s -> 3231.50s]  actually concerned about the game not saving at all ever once. This is concerning me. I have to
[3231.50s -> 3241.70s]  sign in? How am I not signed in? You have to sign in? I am signed in. Is that really what's
[3241.70s -> 3263.90s]  fucking going on? That can't be. Is it? I'm not even fucking signed in. Your call is okay. Do you
[3263.90s -> 3271.45s]  want to exit the session and test your network? No, no, no, no, I don't. No. What did you do?
[3277.99s -> 3294.71s]  Oh my God. Thank Jesus. Wait, there is no save file. Oh my God. No. What the fuck just happened?
[3295.59s -> 3313.11s]  Are you kidding me? Wait. Oh no. No, man. What the fuck? I can't even believe it. I can't even
[3313.11s -> 3318.94s]  believe it. No, this game. I want to play this. I can't believe it. It's not on this one. Like,
[3318.94s -> 3336.06s]  did it go somewhere else? Shit in my pants, man. Oh shit in my pants. Oh, this is just diarrhea.
[3336.62s -> 3347.34s]  Oh my God. I can't believe it. Why would it take me out? No. Oh no. I don't. I can't.
[3348.54s -> 3355.66s]  You got to be kidding me. I got to go fast. I got to go really fast. Fuck. This sucks. Just
[3355.66s -> 3365.59s]  absolute asshole. Oh no. I want to play this. Oh, this sucks. Total ass. I can't believe it.
[3365.59s -> 3372.71s]  This is a second fucking checkpoint. Oh, God damn it. I'm so disappointed. My disappointment
[3372.71s -> 3379.75s]  just is immeasurable right now. Okay. Let's go. I'm going to go fast as hell. I'm going to skip
[3379.75s -> 3397.45s]  every cutscene. I'm going to run. I'm going to punch. And where is the prompt? There's no,
[3397.45s -> 3410.68s]  there was no prompt. I was spinning it. I'm so mad. I'm so fucking mad right now.
[3411.64s -> 3418.36s]  I'm going to need to like just be quiet and just shut my fucking mouth and beat this.
[3426.97s -> 3439.24s]  Shitload of people here right now. What the fuck happened? 8,000 people here. Okay. Fast,
[3439.24s -> 3452.04s]  fast, fast, fast. 437. I was wondering why I wasn't getting any achievements. Fucking not even. Fast.
[3452.04s -> 3464.36s]  I don't care about anything. We're not stopping. We're not helping anyone. Hey, watch it. Yep. Yeah.
[3464.36s -> 3480.68s]  Yep. Okay. Sure. Bye. Wait, it's this one, isn't it? Which one was it? Get out of the bathroom.
[3485.24s -> 3496.65s]  I want some privacy. Okay. I'm fucking around. I'm not even trying to bump around. Get it immediately.
[3500.36s -> 3502.76s]  I have a full minute to do this, guys. It's not a problem.
[3511.19s -> 3523.51s]  Watch out for the barefoot. Take the pain. All right. Let's go. All right. Achievement. Yes.
[3524.07s -> 3527.35s]  Pressure. Oh my god. I was wondering why I wasn't getting these. How would I not be signed in?
[3528.44s -> 3534.95s]  How am I not signed in? How? It's impossible to not be signed in right now. All right. Speedrun. I
[3534.95s -> 3547.35s]  gotta go. Lighter. There's a checkpoint every 15 fucking seconds. I can't believe that this
[3547.35s -> 3559.91s]  went this long without me understanding and realizing that. Wait a minute. I'm like catching
[3559.91s -> 3571.19s]  up to this guy. Am I not supposed to catch up to this dude? Wait. He's not going to be up here,
[3571.19s -> 3589.43s]  is he? Yep. Okay. There are going to be lots of sacrifices to make. Hello. Help. Yes. Get that.
[3589.99s -> 3605.50s]  Okay. Yep. There's rugs in there. Careful. Nope. I didn't even give him a chance. Yeah. I know.
[3608.73s -> 3616.57s]  Okay. I pressed A. You just have to counter everything. Okay. We're good.
[3616.57s -> 3621.67s]  Okay. Holding. You don't understand it. You do like a full crow hop before you swing a light attack.
[3626.98s -> 3636.14s]  Why did I watch that again? I didn't need to watch that.
[3638.46s -> 3648.55s]  Door is sealed. Yep. All right. Get that key. Move. This door is sealed. All right. Go. Yep.
[3648.55s -> 3658.44s]  There's a note here. Good. Okay. Who is the jigsaw killer? I don't know. I wonder. What did
[3658.44s -> 3668.14s]  I do here? I don't even remember. What was it? Everything's sealed. What did I have to do?
[3668.14s -> 3675.86s]  There's a key inside his body. Yeah. I know. Well, how do I get the fuck out of here? Oh yeah. You.
[3675.86s -> 3691.72s]  Give me that. Okay. Bye. Glass. Yep. There's a shotgun door. All right. We're almost back.
[3692.44s -> 3700.34s]  Thank God you can skip cut scenes. I say that as I can. Okay.
[3701.14s -> 3703.86s]  Nail. Got it. Good. Okay. Everything got health.
[3704.66s -> 3708.10s]  Pick this up. Touch that. Read it so the game knows I looked at it in case I need it eventually.
[3708.10s -> 3711.30s]  Okay. Keep going. Go, go, go, go, go. Hurry the fuck up. I'm not going fast enough.
[3712.02s -> 3717.13s]  Instant health bandage. Got it. Okay. Cool. Nothing in here. Go. Out. I win.
[3717.77s -> 3734.70s]  And in any of this shit. And that's it. Key. Unlock the door. No, I want to go down.
[3735.18s -> 3751.24s]  Out of this. All right. Go. Good. I've made it back pretty much to where I was.
[3751.96s -> 3759.18s]  Find a key to unlock the main hall. I was down here. Remember I was like, I built a school. Right.
[3760.06s -> 3762.70s]  Remember when I did that? Something like that. All right. Let's go.
[3775.30s -> 3781.40s]  Would you like to know more? Okay. Remember there was somebody in here?
[3782.52s -> 3791.78s]  Yep. There was somebody in there. That's crazy. Okay. Remember this? The gulp. I remember the gulp.
[3791.78s -> 3803.48s]  That was pretty funny. And then there's a key. I almost just, I almost just died right there.
[3804.65s -> 3809.77s]  Okay. The key to survival lies within. Right. And then you have to, uh, cut into the, to,
[3809.77s -> 3819.64s]  Oh, right. A Minecraft punch. I don't know where to put your head. Hey, save. The game is saving.
[3819.64s -> 3829.16s]  I got it. It's fine. You're getting participation trophies.
[3833.86s -> 3839.86s]  It's always so funny. Back in the Xbox days when they, it really was just tied to if you progressed
[3839.86s -> 3852.55s]  in the game or not. What does that even supposed to mean to do? If I get it wrong
[3853.67s -> 3861.45s]  and the knife stabs me instead. All right, let's go. It's this guy, right? Yeah. It's Arnie.
[3864.38s -> 3877.21s]  All right, Arnie. Sorry. Body punches you. That's so dumb. That's real. Okay. Use the key. Yep.
[3878.98s -> 3896.78s]  Okay. Here we are. We made it in both doors. I know the Oreo lady. Yeah. Wait. Okay. This,
[3896.78s -> 3900.92s]  this is probably, there's gotta be a reason why you do that, right? Watch out for that glass.
[3901.32s -> 3924.60s]  All right. Now I just need, uh, over here. Made it. There's Mortal Kombat at himself.
[3928.06s -> 3931.90s]  Some ways through the asylum were more dangerous than others. Use left stick to walk over the
[3931.90s -> 3942.17s]  hazard and use right stick to balance. He even did like a front flip too. He treated this like
[3942.17s -> 3964.81s]  it was a ball pit at McDonald's. All right. Is there anything else here? It's right here.
[3964.81s -> 3971.59s]  Thank God I signed it. Why would you do that? Just go across it. What the fuck are you doing?
[3972.23s -> 3987.67s]  I got the key, right? Is this guy open? Yeah, let's go. Oh, thank God. Yeah. No, it's fine.
[3993.02s -> 3998.90s]  To be fair though, wouldn't you sprint across that shit? Why would you balance beam? No, just,
[3998.90s -> 4011.37s]  just do a full sprint and jump and leap the fuck over the whole thing. How would you balance beam
[4011.37s -> 4018.84s]  that? No, that's not the way to do it. Look at the distance here. That's not that far. If you go,
[4019.56s -> 4043.02s]  this guy had the right idea, but he just rolled off. I have like, my like steering needs to be
[4043.02s -> 4055.67s]  aligned. It pulls a little to the left. What the fuck was that kid? Freedom. Can you rescue
[4055.67s -> 4067.14s]  her detective tap? Can you rescue her detective tap? Is she in there? Hold on. Is there something
[4067.14s -> 4081.88s]  over here? Freedom. Freedom is an illusion in $600 million facility. Is this baking soda?
[4083.13s -> 4089.02s]  Antiges. I have full health. I would have have not full health. You either fall down on the spikes
[4089.02s -> 4104.63s]  and die or that's it. What is this trying to tell me? I need to find a coupler.
[4105.67s -> 4119.85s]  All right, I got a nail. I got nothing. Unlock the cabinet. Oh, thank God. The puzzles
[4120.41s -> 4131.69s]  are 100% brainless. I mean, and I mean 100%. Like there's been nothing that you really need
[4131.69s -> 4137.27s]  to even spend more than one to two full seconds understanding how it works. That just makes me
[4137.27s -> 4147.50s]  happy. I don't want to do puzzles and shit. Fuck that. Who wants to do puzzles? I said the fine
[4147.50s -> 4170.39s]  thing. He's dumb. I mean, that's fine. It's a checkpoint. Okay. Now what? Dig saw box open.
[4171.27s -> 4181.67s]  Who am I? Name blacked out. Patient ID 825-3612-3127. April 14, 1998. Fund initial
[4181.67s -> 4188.95s]  assessment, whoever it is, presents as well as a well-spoken man with a firm grasp upon reality.
[4188.95s -> 4195.91s]  Patient 34 years old, married for two years with wife four months pregnant, denies necessity of
[4195.91s -> 4201.19s]  psychological treatment but is kept appointment at the request of his wife with sister visitation
[4201.19s -> 4205.83s]  due to a concern of a growing isolationistic tendencies. Patient displays high degree of
[4205.83s -> 4211.59s]  verbal acuity and is very observant. Initial test suggest a very high IQ with an extraordinary
[4211.59s -> 4217.03s]  ability to recall facts but their expressed pride in his intelligence and knowledge
[4217.03s -> 4220.63s]  exhibit who cares about any of this. Patient is polite and cordial. All right, that's all I need
[4220.63s -> 4227.11s]  to know. They have an affection for his wife and animals and stuff. He's not. Let's display them.
[4227.11s -> 4232.63s]  After initial consultation, they don't need to come in anymore. They just follow up here.
[4232.63s -> 4236.47s]  Patient displays tendencies towards depression and narcissistic personality disorder. Okay.
[4236.47s -> 4249.93s]  What was I hopping for? Come on, game. What the fuck is this? Where's the blood?
[4250.89s -> 4257.75s]  Well, ask in you. Wait, a crutch? I want the crutch. The crutch is definitely more powerful.
[4258.39s -> 4285.11s]  I just bolted. I'm just going to queue it up. All right. It's the swing is so bad. Just counter
[4285.11s -> 4296.09s]  everything. Only parry. Oh no, not another one of these. All right. Just take it slow. Don't be an
[4296.09s -> 4315.96s]  idiot. All right. I feel like I'm playing condemned. Where's the guy that's going to run around the
[4316.04s -> 4335.58s]  corner? The two by four with a big tray. Oh, it's okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. A pipe. No, I want the
[4335.58s -> 4345.30s]  crutch. I can't help two items. Just put one down your pants. Like slide the pipe down your like
[4345.30s -> 4348.50s]  back or front of your underwear. What do you mean? You don't have a pocket or something. Just take
[4348.50s -> 4372.33s]  it. You might need it. Dual welding. Sorry. Wielding dual wielding. I go down here. I feel
[4372.33s -> 4385.90s]  like I'm not supposed to be over here. Oh, yes, I am. All right. Checkpoint is faster than I am.
[4385.90s -> 4390.52s]  Are we in this? The cop that's been chasing you and interrogating me.
[4390.52s -> 4398.50s]  You see here the face is obsession and to make a choice, your life will depend.
[4403.32s -> 4423.42s]  Is this her? I got the fuse. Dark. Darkness also illuminates. I guess. I don't know. What is it?
[4423.42s -> 4434.62s]  Writing poetry? What does that mean? Dude, one time. Did I talk about this before? I was in the store.
[4434.62s -> 4439.10s]  This is like a year or two ago. I was in the store and there was poetry books on the shelf.
[4439.74s -> 4447.50s]  I've talked about this before. Have we? Where it's okay. It's a poetry book. The book is probably
[4448.06s -> 4455.10s]  can't be more than 50 or 60 pages. And I don't know if this is supposed to be for like aesthetic
[4455.10s -> 4460.76s]  reasons. I don't know. I was trying to figure it out. Half of the pages, the poems were one or two
[4460.76s -> 4468.60s]  sentences and it took up the whole paper. It was just the entire page was like one sentence.
[4468.60s -> 4476.62s]  And then like the next page was like three sentences. Next page, one sentence. Oh, it
[4476.62s -> 4491.21s]  wasn't a kid's book. YouTuber poems. Oh, well, this is what? What's this? Wait, I have a fuse.
[4491.21s -> 4502.04s]  They're going to deactivate them. All right. I did it. The room has been deactivated or something.
[4502.04s -> 4516.52s]  Oh, I was just a pinata. Don't do it. How far back will it put me? It's going to be a
[4516.52s -> 4539.06s]  audio tape. Here we go. But he's here. He's in the room. Sometimes to search the room to find the
[4539.06s -> 4549.90s]  obvious detective. Because I kind of trapped myself in here. I kind of forgot which one I turned on
[4549.90s -> 4560.14s]  first. I've been here for a few hours. Get us both out of here. That'd be great. Sure thing,
[4560.14s -> 4566.12s]  Jake. So I'll take care of it. It's going to be really good. It's going to be really good.
[4575.16s -> 4591.94s]  I do. He wired that wrong. That was he fucked up the wiring. He let him down.
[4592.82s -> 4615.37s]  I just got it. What? No, I pressed A on this thing.
[4620.94s -> 4629.42s]  Okay, it's it. What about fuck the puzzle? It's in the gun draw. Oh, it's still a fuse box.
[4630.14s -> 4641.29s]  It's this one. Oh, I got the coupler. Okay, cool. I have 12 seconds. Wait, the audio tape.
[4642.09s -> 4666.54s]  Give me the audio tape quick. Too many people. I didn't even install the fuse box. Is that going
[4666.54s -> 4678.30s]  to be bad? When I blew up the room first. It was like lights on the wall. Wait, hold on.
[4678.30s -> 4696.01s]  It's a secret entrance. It's a bomb right there. What's wrong with what's going on with this one?
[4703.16s -> 4723.06s]  Yep. Rink it. Can I even do this? I didn't break the whole game. Did I? Is it broken?
[4723.62s -> 4741.38s]  I don't think I was supposed to do this yet. I didn't get the fuse yet. Oh, where the fuck is
[4741.54s -> 4748.06s]  the fuse? Oh, right. Okay. Now I see what you're understanding here. Okay,
[4749.27s -> 4772.28s]  go. Did I just get it? I just picked it up. It's happening right now. Okay, it's lit up.
[4772.28s -> 4784.52s]  Now I have to follow the path. He was on battery acid when he did this. How did he get on the
[4784.52s -> 4795.61s]  ceiling? Well, this is like you didn't even try. This is not even right. Is that supposed to
[4795.61s -> 4817.83s]  fuck with me? I don't even know what he's talking about. So what? I have to connect the line with
[4817.83s -> 4836.07s]  your eyes and then the door will present itself. It's the gun. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm already way
[4836.07s -> 4842.79s]  ahead of this. My IQ is too high. I did this. I already got that. I already did this. I opened
[4842.79s -> 4848.15s]  the gun. I did this backwards. I did this in reverse. So where do I go? What did I just get?
[4848.15s -> 4853.72s]  What do I have? Holy shit. I can't believe you did this fucking whole thing backwards.
[4854.36s -> 4863.98s]  What does it pick up? What? Oh, crutch. What did I get for doing this? Another fuse box?
[4864.62s -> 4878.28s]  Back up to the ladder. This game suck. Anybody know? Oh, I got the coupler. The coupler.
[4878.76s -> 4904.39s]  Who the fuck is this guy? Hey, come here. Watch out. This glass. Get over here. I'm coming up there.
[4910.23s -> 4935.50s]  What? Why is he waiting? Wait, why did I do that? Are you all right? There's no reason. Oh my god.
[4935.50s -> 4947.02s]  I was right in the fucking mouth. And I didn't even say anything. This is... Holy shit. Um, okay.
[4948.49s -> 4956.94s]  Wait. I, I, I... You just have to unbolt the door, dude. You just have to unbolt. Oh,
[4956.94s -> 4959.98s]  you could have been my friend. We could have had... We could have gone together.
[4960.70s -> 4968.06s]  I could have had a person with me instead. Holy shit. That was unbelievably horrible.
[4968.62s -> 4973.48s]  Okay. What's in the box? Oh, nothing in the box. Just the thing that goes...
[4983.06s -> 5028.20s]  All right. I have the coupler. Now what? I got it. Everybody fucking relax. Relax. Relax. It took
[5028.20s -> 5043.42s]  like not even 60 seconds. Lower the office. What office? This one? All right. Press button.
[5043.42s -> 5069.54s]  I got an exit. How do I get over there? Where are you going? I don't know. Where am I going?
[5069.54s -> 5086.57s]  What do I do? Can I move this? I like drag this out of the way. Oh, there we go. Sick. Oh,
[5086.57s -> 5101.35s]  look at that. Sick. Checkpoint. All right. I have two nails. What do I do with this shit?
[5102.07s -> 5108.38s]  You missed a secret room. Secret room. Secret room. I'm like, I'm blind. Oh, I'm all right.
[5111.56s -> 5117.35s]  I still... What do I have? A person's leg? That's a baseball bat. Right. Okay. Let's keep going.
[5119.05s -> 5126.17s]  Glass? Who's making that noise? I'm here to rescue you. All right. Call the police. Make a
[5126.17s -> 5153.50s]  telephone call now. Okay. Somebody in there? Somebody in this room? Did I save you? Aren't
[5153.50s -> 5165.05s]  you the police? Am I? All right. I'm the police. Oh shit. Pick up pipe. No. That's way better. No.
[5165.05s -> 5173.11s]  Pipe has more slots left. Dude, I'm telling you, man. I find somebody. I do a full combo, full five
[5173.11s -> 5177.67s]  slot, eviscerate on somebody. Whoa. That'll do probably 700 damage and create yellow numbers.
[5178.63s -> 5194.95s]  Whatever. And there's a wow reference. Whatever. Who's this guy? He's superhuman. Barricade.
[5194.95s -> 5198.79s]  Sometimes a bolt of door is not enough. Keep enemies from breaking through a closed and bolted
[5198.79s -> 5202.55s]  door. Move something heavy in front of the door. But everybody's like, hey, I have a pipe. Just hit
[5202.55s -> 5211.06s]  him in the head. Just fucking hit him. I mean, you have to do this. What do you have to do?
[5211.78s -> 5229.86s]  Well, come in. Thanks for the free item, you fucking idiot. Quick. Block the door. Barricade
[5229.86s -> 5241.02s]  the door. I get the tutorial message. One of us. What have you had? You may have had something
[5241.02s -> 5251.46s]  very important to tell me. OK, move it back. I didn't get a no tutorial. I have to do this.
[5254.92s -> 5265.46s]  We didn't spend very much time trying to kill me. That's encouraging. Checking. Why am I
[5265.46s -> 5269.22s]  checking for items? Who cares? Just beat it. Just beat the game. This game's probably like three
[5269.22s -> 5277.56s]  hours long. OK, what's the percentage chance that this is longer than the movie? Is this game's
[5277.56s -> 5287.61s]  story mode longer than the movie that it's based on? Find out. And I just probably played for like
[5287.61s -> 5292.25s]  three or four hours and never played this ever again. We'll see. You're never going to see this
[5292.25s -> 5303.62s]  game again. Yeah, that's a guarantee. But it only happens if you die without having been signed in.
[5304.26s -> 5322.15s]  Yeah. Oh, just. All right. Take some. Free. For the amount of health that I have and the amount
[5322.15s -> 5328.26s]  of danger I've potentially been in. I feel like insane probably wouldn't be that insane.
[5331.13s -> 5337.40s]  All right. Let's let's let's go. What the fuck? Getting a good gamers score from this.
[5340.25s -> 5348.47s]  And here is over there. I don't know. What is that? What is this? Have I been in here?
[5349.19s -> 5384.87s]  This is headphones. This is the person on the drugs. This is the minor price.
[5384.87s -> 5415.58s]  I want that fucking vacation. Let's go. Oh, there's a key in there.
[5415.58s -> 5426.18s]  It's sitting on the table. Wow. I can just go in and grab it. Uh oh. It's not going to be that easy.
[5426.74s -> 5454.49s]  Crap. I really like bombs. OK, we need to find the code for the door.
[5455.29s -> 5479.11s]  Nothing in the cabinets. Oh, shit. It's a fuse box. OK, fuse. Fuse. Can I do it? Now what? Five,
[5479.11s -> 5501.42s]  seven, nine. Quickly. Hurry up. Five, seven. Go backwards. Still going to blow up? Uh oh.
[5501.42s -> 5512.65s]  Oh, no. No boss fight. Now I'm in another room. TVs and bombs.
[5516.90s -> 5523.54s]  That's all this guy's got. You got a surplus of old televisions and bombs and you rescue her?
[5524.18s -> 5544.34s]  Detective Tapp? Question mark. Can you? It took a lot of yard sales for you to get
[5544.90s -> 5559.26s]  all these TVs, Jigsaw. I mean, that's known. Where'd you get all the bombs? I don't understand.
[5560.12s -> 5564.60s]  Where do you get them? Where would he? What do you mean? Where would he have built them?
[5565.16s -> 5572.63s]  Until now, the Jigsaw Killer has never left anyone alive. Amanda Young is now the first
[5572.63s -> 5577.35s]  and only known survivor of the Jigsaw Killer. Details about Young are forthcoming. She is
[5577.35s -> 5583.46s]  to make a statement regarding her capture. He saved my life. These are the words spoken
[5583.46s -> 5587.22s]  by Amanda Young, only known survivor of the Jigsaw Killer. I mean, at what point? Hold on.
[5587.22s -> 5590.90s]  Do we know? At what point? Where does it think we know in the story? Because this is just Saw.
[5595.66s -> 5603.69s]  I think, no, this takes place. We have seen Saw 6 at this point, or Saw 5, because there's a trailer
[5603.69s -> 5610.10s]  for Saw 6 on the disc. I remember seeing it. So it assumes we've seen all five Saw movies.
[5610.10s -> 5612.74s]  So just want to make sure you guys are aware. There's probably going to be some spoilers,
[5612.74s -> 5624.30s]  but Saw is one through five. I mean, I already know. Maybe you do. I don't know. Do you?
[5626.70s -> 5632.54s]  We had Chiyo Chan give five community subs. Thank you. We also had $50 coming.
[5632.54s -> 5638.79s]  There's 5,000 bits earlier that I missed. I'm a terrible streamer. I'm very bad at everything
[5638.79s -> 5643.43s]  that I do. I mean, you new viewers that are here right now, I might just skip over your
[5643.43s -> 5646.47s]  $50 donation. Just want to make sure we're aware of that, apparently.
[5648.10s -> 5651.94s]  There's Green Templar. Thanks for the fucking huge amount of money.
[5651.94s -> 5656.81s]  They say, Jeremy, I want to say thank you for the entertainment you've given me. You're so
[5656.81s -> 5661.11s]  unique and have... Oh, look at that. I'm fucking unique. Really innovated the streaming formula
[5661.11s -> 5666.06s]  with your comedy and your creative use of the tools available to you. I do have one request,
[5666.06s -> 5669.50s]  though, if you can. I really like when you play strategy games and really recommend you play
[5669.50s -> 5675.75s]  Total Warhammer 2 as the rats. It fits your theme, and I think it would be fun for a stream. Stay
[5675.75s -> 5683.46s]  safe. I think I've completely given up on ever doing anything that has to do with managing
[5683.46s -> 5689.30s]  2,000 units over the course of a giant map that I have to feed units into diplomacy and shit. I
[5689.30s -> 5693.22s]  don't think I'll ever do it again. I had an absolute mess of a time trying to play something
[5693.22s -> 5697.46s]  like Mountain Blade, and then people were like, hey, you should try Crusader Kings. And I'm like,
[5697.46s -> 5709.29s]  nope. Is this like Crusader's Kings? Shove? What the fuck? It's different.
[5709.85s -> 5712.94s]  I don't want to watch this fucking show.
[5731.53s -> 5745.54s]  I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm coming.
[5772.62s -> 5780.95s]  How am I going to get injected? Oh, shit.
[5785.48s -> 5819.05s]  All right. Antidote. Hey, just breathe in the antidote. Okay. Antidote going in. Toxin
[5819.05s -> 5831.08s]  being released. Antidote. Antidote go that way. And then antidote. All right. Antidote going in.
[5835.34s -> 5847.11s]  Bingo. Did I win? I just made us way more powerful. Look at that heartbeat now.
[5847.67s -> 5861.35s]  We have the heartbeat of a small fish. All right. Antidote. Toxin. Yeah, get the toxin out of here.
[5861.35s -> 5868.04s]  We don't dump that that way. I'm going to give you more of that toxin. Wait, and then put the
[5868.04s -> 5875.21s]  antidote over here. Look, Jigsaw, you didn't really explain the rules very well. Antidote.
[5876.30s -> 5914.38s]  Okay, I think we're safe now. I'm still alive. Just match the color. What do you mean match the color?
[5915.50s -> 5923.24s]  Sorry, I was talking. I was talking over the cutscene. Is he going to explain it again?
[5932.25s -> 5940.63s]  Red, left, blue, right. I wasn't paying any attention at all. Like zero. I was looking
[5940.63s -> 5968.73s]  at chat and like talking about stuff. Red, left, blue, right. He literally said it.
[5974.82s -> 5986.10s]  He literally said it. Red, left, blue, right. All right. What's coming up first? I didn't, I
[5987.64s -> 5995.74s]  wanted to put it to the left. I wasn't trying to make it go right. Red, left. Okay. Blue, right.
[5996.30s -> 6016.79s]  Okay. Red, left. This is fucking, um, it, it's just, I'm trying. No, why is it doing,
[6016.79s -> 6028.60s]  I'm trying to go the other way. I'm, it's just putting them down auto, free stuff, fucking thing.
[6028.60s -> 6033.64s]  You made the blue go, I didn't do anything. It's just automatically doing the, can I move the device?
[6034.60s -> 6046.95s]  Okay. Blue goes right. So I'm going to do, it's going to go, go, go, go, go. So we're going to go,
[6047.67s -> 6064.12s]  let's go put it down there. You're thinking too far ahead. Jigsaw, your puzzle's dumb.
[6065.00s -> 6069.00s]  I can, what, I can't, I just like dig my hands through like my Play-Doh insides to find the
[6069.00s -> 6084.63s]  fucking device. Why do we have to do this? I don't want to do this. Okay. Now blue. Okay. Red. Red.
[6086.30s -> 6111.35s]  No, blue. Blue. Okay. Now blue. Now red. Blue. Okay. Now blue again. Blue. Oh shit. Hold on.
[6111.35s -> 6119.85s]  It's just as stupid as just, just alternate them every time. Am I overthinking this like crazy
[6119.85s -> 6133.70s]  right now? Is it just alternate every time? And that's it. What's the point I have what,
[6133.70s -> 6150.54s]  why have a puzzle? No, it's not. That's, that's not that simple. Is it? Oh my God. It's actually
[6150.54s -> 6155.19s]  that simple. Okay. Now we go. No, it's not. It's not that simple. The fucking things moved. Fuck.
[6155.83s -> 6165.19s]  Are we going to go blue? Okay. Now we're going to go, um, blue again. No, no. What happened? What the
[6165.19s -> 6177.43s]  fuck is happening right now? What? Oh boy. This is, it's storing. She's dead. Oh fuck. This is bad.
[6177.43s -> 6180.63s]  I don't know. Uh, I'm just going to wait till you guys tell me what to do. I'm not even kidding.
[6180.63s -> 6184.86s]  What do I do? I'm not even going to press any buttons until you say whatever it is.
[6186.97s -> 6198.04s]  Okay. Uh, now what? Red. Which one? Blue. Blue again. Red. You fucking assholes. You lied to me.
[6198.04s -> 6211.35s]  She's dead. Do it again. Oh my God. This just sucks. This actually sucks. I don't want to do
[6211.35s -> 6216.15s]  this. I'm going to only listen to you. All right. Is there a, is there a mod in the chat right now?
[6217.11s -> 6223.40s]  Is there a mod in the chat? Uh, I'm going to only, I want one mod to tell me how to beat this.
[6226.44s -> 6234.46s]  Okay. It's just alternate only. So it's just blue, red, blue, red, blue, red, blue.
[6235.26s -> 6278.87s]  Just go. Let me have to start storing them in shit. No mods. Uh oh. Uh oh. Okay. So, um, here we go.
[6289.78s -> 6303.80s]  Blue. Blue first. And then now it's going to be, uh, blue again, right? Can I pause it? Okay. If
[6303.80s -> 6311.13s]  the game's stupid, I can pause it. Now it's red. Okay. Now we've got a double scenario here. We now
[6311.13s -> 6322.60s]  we do blue twice. Blue twice. Blue twice. Blue twice. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Red.
[6329.16s -> 6344.10s]  Then red again. No, blue. No, no. Blue again. Blue. Blue here. Okay. Now red. Okay. Now,
[6345.42s -> 6374.52s]  um, now blue. Okay. Now red. Okay. Now blue. Okay. Now red. Okay. Now blue. Okay. Now red.
[6375.16s -> 6387.69s]  Okay. Now blue. It was just the same thing. I overthought the fuck out of that.
[6389.22s -> 6398.06s]  That was the most overthinking ever. It's okay. You're okay. What did you do? I'm not him. I'm not
[6398.06s -> 6407.62s]  the one who. It's okay. I'm okay. I know. Look, we have to play by his rules. I saw him. I saw him.
[6408.18s -> 6413.14s]  Who is he? What did he look like? That's all you care about. I just nearly died.
[6413.14s -> 6416.18s]  Me too. We're all here because of you, detective.
[6420.44s -> 6430.57s]  Ooh. Damaged goods. Chapter one complete. I thought this had eat light source. Why?
[6431.21s -> 6445.32s]  I'm here. I already remember. I made it through one of his tests before right now. We have to be
[6445.32s -> 6449.82s]  careful. Doors aren't what they seem. I can't wait till she walks through one of these and
[6449.82s -> 6457.11s]  gets killed. I have a feeling this entire asylum is trapped. Play by the rules and we both might
[6457.11s -> 6464.97s]  make it. He's watching. Already survived one trap by him. How clearly I failed the test.
[6465.69s -> 6470.26s]  That's why he brought me back here and with a fucking cop. No less. Just be sure of this.
[6470.82s -> 6486.74s]  Jigsaw's in control. Not you. Okay. Knock it off. Okay. I just needed to know if you could.
[6487.78s -> 6499.56s]  She died? You don't. Can I kill her? Oh, he's in control, huh? Knock it off. Oh,
[6503.00s -> 6528.50s]  nothing in there. I am in control. Oh, I found a clue over here. Can I do anything with this?
[6529.22s -> 6538.52s]  I got back up. Back up. Back the fuck up. I got a lighter. You're wasting durability. Yeah,
[6538.52s -> 6584.65s]  you're right. Alright, Jigsaw, open the door. A little too long wind in here. Let's go. Wait.
[6585.78s -> 6599.27s]  Help. I'm coming. I'm here. You're still with me, right? Okay. Nothing in that work table.
[6599.91s -> 6605.85s]  Pick up. What is it? A mop handle. Oh, absolutely. Here. I'll trade.
[6606.81s -> 6629.00s]  Oh, be careful. Hey, you think the man you killed cried for help the same way as he lay dying in
[6629.00s -> 6638.89s]  the street. What was he on? You covered it up, but like anything buried inside you. This really
[6638.89s -> 6655.94s]  could be Kylo Ren. Everyone you love. It's like the same lines. I give her a weapon. I really mean
[6655.94s -> 6668.42s]  this. I can't give you anything. Why can't I give you something? I hope he says the word
[6668.42s -> 6689.62s]  unit. Look out behind you. He's electrocuting her. Okay. Well, I'm glad I don't have to worry
[6689.62s -> 6695.69s]  about another person. I would have been a pain in the ass. Has there been anything in any of
[6695.69s -> 6698.89s]  these draws ever the whole time we played? What's the point of this stuff? It's here.
[6698.89s -> 6717.62s]  Here. All right. Stay calm. Friend or enemy. I don't know. We didn't have a chance to
[6718.18s -> 6723.78s]  determine who that was. All right. Watch out. This is a tank that
[6726.58s -> 6735.58s]  find the boiler room key. Go in the acid. Uh-oh. No, I don't want to just reach in the acid.
[6736.46s -> 6743.05s]  Why did I do this? Why did I do that? There's nothing in here. Oh,
[6759.45s -> 6774.04s]  wait, I open this to live or die, live or die, live or die. Find the, find the, find the,
[6774.04s -> 6777.48s]  find the, find the truth. Find the truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth.
[6778.28s -> 6799.72s]  Find the remix. What does that mean? Body bag, shotgun shell, and tripwire.
[6800.44s -> 6808.57s]  Oh, I get a shotgun. I get a gun. I hope I get a gun. Even walking can be dangerous in Jigsaw's
[6808.57s -> 6812.89s]  world. Watch the ground for shotgun tripwires and disable them before they go off. You can also
[6812.89s -> 6817.90s]  rearm these to use against enemies. Oh, that's right here. Okay. Well, how do I turn it off?
[6818.70s -> 6838.71s]  Buddy, how do I turn it off? So, all right, now arm it. Wait, now arm it while I'm across it.
[6842.94s -> 6853.72s]  Okay. I'm going to forget that that's there, but try to remind me. I almost blew my fucking head off.
[6859.98s -> 6873.32s]  That was, that was close. I'm not going to lie. See the janitor about the steam. I need a wheel.
[6877.94s -> 6895.27s]  Why? What's the thing with steam hurting you and killing you and stuff? Are you telling me
[6895.27s -> 6900.63s]  that you can't just like full sprint and like slide underneath that? Just take your shirt and
[6900.63s -> 6907.24s]  like cover your head and stuff and just run, sprint, slide. It's hot. Yeah. Slide on and just,
[6907.24s -> 6920.06s]  just sprint as fast as you can. You'll get like a little bit on you. It sticks to you.
[6922.81s -> 6927.37s]  You know, the one of the seals broke today near the boiler. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[6927.37s -> 6933.58s]  Treasure. Next time. Seal breaks might kill someone. Yeah. Well, you didn't tell me where
[6933.58s -> 6946.12s]  the wheel was. Uh, is this the game's excuse to just get you? I don't understand why I keep doing
[6946.12s -> 6978.79s]  it. I feel like that's the game telling me I was out of bounds for too long. What? Escape the bathroom.
[6979.75s -> 6997.37s]  Uh, what are the rules? What's the rule book? Darkness illuminates. All right. Put down the
[6997.37s -> 7008.55s]  darkness illuminates. Uh huh. All right. Turn the light off. Light switch. Be in this toilet over
[7008.55s -> 7027.53s]  here. Get all these needles. I got the key. Is that a key to the helmet?
[7034.10s -> 7042.81s]  Okay. Rescue. Go to the janitor's office. Okay. And his office is this way. Where's that bomb?
[7043.53s -> 7048.34s]  Where's that? Where's that tripwire? It's over here, right? That's not, where is it?
[7049.06s -> 7066.73s]  Is it right here? Where's that tripwire? I don't know where it is. Your shotgun collar reacts to
[7066.73s -> 7071.78s]  specific enemies with shotgun collars. When you get near one of these enemies, the lights on the
[7071.78s -> 7076.42s]  back of your collar will blink. The closer the enemy, the closer the enemy, the faster the
[7076.42s -> 7082.54s]  blinking and the faster your own collar will detonate. Try to stay far away from enemies with
[7082.54s -> 7086.78s]  collars. If you keep your distance long enough, the enemy collar will explode and deactivate.
[7088.84s -> 7097.34s]  Ah, don't come near me, man. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away. Get away. Don't you know
[7097.34s -> 7106.10s]  what these things are? You fucking idiot. Stop. Leave me alone. Hold the door. All right. You're
[7106.10s -> 7130.33s]  fucked. Dead. Wait, but his collar is still on the ground. Where is he? I got his, wait, oh,
[7130.33s -> 7156.90s]  there he is. I was gonna say this is his arm. Oh, this is where he explains it. Okay. Pick this
[7156.90s -> 7176.46s]  lock. Oh crap. I can't do that. What's he doing? I want to select this one. The number is Jeremy.
[7176.46s -> 7188.22s]  What do they mean? I don't know. This is shit. Unlock. Jigsaw chest. Gear. A nail. What's in
[7188.22s -> 7232.01s]  the jigsaw chest? Oh boy. Wait, I have to, I didn't know there were other sizes. All right,
[7232.01s -> 7293.18s]  there's this huge, come on. How far on do I have to go? Got it. Doctor, his brain's too big.
[7293.18s -> 7306.33s]  Shotgun shell trip where I end bandages. Excellent. Oh, got it. Now we've got to go
[7310.58s -> 7322.23s]  over, we have to go the way that guy came. Bathed up over here. Probably a dead body in it.
[7322.95s -> 7329.18s]  Search the area to find the valve wheel. Oh, no, I want to press his hand. Way cooler.
[7333.14s -> 7346.98s]  Storage. Oh, the baseball bat in here. What do I care? I don't care. Nothing. I break this wall.
[7348.55s -> 7357.03s]  No. Need a hand, Jeremy. And then why didn't you do the Pepe laugh thing?
[7357.91s -> 7363.21s]  How would you write that and not write Pepe laugh? Have you ever been on the internet before? Come
[7363.21s -> 7373.86s]  on. The wheel is nearby. It's probably right behind this. Behind the chalkboard.
[7383.18s -> 7390.07s]  Wow. I almost just walked right into that. Okay. That would have been bad. I'm knocking. I can't
[7390.07s -> 7403.75s]  see that shit. How am I supposed to reliably see those? Oh, there it is. Nothing. Wait,
[7403.75s -> 7412.34s]  what was in there? I don't know. Rip wire. Okay. That's the point. Oh, no one's even hurt me.
[7413.30s -> 7432.81s]  I'm untouchable. Yeah, I gotta get this open into the utility room. What the hell did that just say?
[7433.77s -> 7439.51s]  What did that just say? What did that just say? That was a huge amount of text. What did it say?
[7443.40s -> 7463.66s]  Oh, I think that guy died. Well, what is this? Probably said don't touch electricity. Table lamp.
[7464.95s -> 7473.11s]  No, I want the, I want the wooden leg. Uh, they call these people insane, but I don't see that.
[7473.11s -> 7483.19s]  Somebody else will read this screenshot and look at it. This is the guy they told us about.
[7495.83s -> 7522.89s]  There you are. Where am I? Who are you? Who is, who is me? Step on, come over here.
[7525.64s -> 7545.86s]  Do you see it? He sees it. What the fuck? He doesn't see it. Does he? I crit this guy. Nice.
[7545.86s -> 7556.15s]  Nice. All right. How do I get this guy to come over here? Come over here. Hey, this way.
[7563.43s -> 7585.30s]  Where is he? Where is he? Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Okay. Hold on. Here we go. Oh my God.
[7585.30s -> 7595.88s]  That was fucking horrible. Well, I got him. Turn that off. Don't die. This, uh, I think there was
[7595.88s -> 7603.02s]  another wire here or a shell that I couldn't get before because I had full inventory. I like it
[7603.02s -> 7616.86s]  matters. Oh, it don't fucking hurt. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Full nails. All right. Now back to
[7616.86s -> 7623.51s]  that door. Table lamp hog. Yeah. It's time to pick up the table lamp. You're right.
[7626.81s -> 7642.17s]  Oh, nothing. Wait, nothing. Why are they still lit up? What is this? Okay. Now I get the hell
[7642.17s -> 7657.58s]  out of here. I go, um, uh, this way. Wait, what did he have? Oh, he's a mop handle. I got the wheel
[7658.22s -> 7666.79s]  back to the steam room, which was down and just making sure he didn't stand up.
[7670.89s -> 7678.33s]  This guy got out. How did this guy get out of this chamber?
[7687.51s -> 7693.54s]  I keep getting achievements. Wait, is that thing going to explode?
[7701.80s -> 7707.66s]  Okay. That was, wait, I think I ran out of material. He's really dead. Yeah. He's very dead.
[7708.46s -> 7738.02s]  Okay. Steam room this way. There's electricity everywhere over here. What room am I even in?
[7738.02s -> 7752.65s]  What is this place? I turned it off. I just found like a new area. Diffuse.
[7753.45s -> 7761.56s]  Take it. Joe Biden game play. I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
[7781.06s -> 7786.41s]  What is, how is that? What do you mean true? I I'm just like progressing through the game.
[7786.41s -> 7797.21s]  What are you talking about? Please read. Hold on. It was an important please read comment.
[7798.66s -> 7801.86s]  Please read. There's no risk in this game because you aren't actually in danger. If you fail one of
[7801.86s -> 7806.10s]  Jigsaw's games, you die. You should have to snap a rubber band against your wrist or pop a balloon
[7806.10s -> 7820.94s]  next to your ear. Why? I don't want to do that. Oh, fuck that. I'm not popping balloons next to my
[7820.94s -> 7834.95s]  head. All right. Where's the steam room? Fuck balloons. That hurt? Why did that hurt so bad?
[7835.59s -> 7851.26s]  Wait, where am I? Furnace. Spoiler room. No escape. No escape. It felt like 20 feet.
[7851.90s -> 7866.98s]  It did not fall that far. Use an Estus. Good. Okay. Not what?
[7870.81s -> 7880.02s]  Okay. I don't have a wire. What do I do? I don't have a wire. There's no wire. I don't have a wire.
[7880.66s -> 7901.32s]  Got one. Okay. 40 seconds. Uh oh. What was the point of, what was the point of me doing that?
[7910.38s -> 7928.31s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go. How much time? Good. Oh, the acid. Remember? Okay. Furnace. Spoiler room.
[7928.31s -> 7947.48s]  We just can't, what? The trip wire. Trip wire from like 30 minutes ago. Whatever.
[7954.87s -> 7961.11s]  Be fair though with me. That was a while ago. And where the fuck even is that? Okay. On your,
[7961.11s -> 7965.18s]  do you see it on your screen? I don't. Like, I don't even know where it is now.
[7965.90s -> 7976.65s]  It's right there. Okay. That shit wasn't even on the screen. Let's turn the fuck up.
[7993.22s -> 7996.34s]  Turn it back on. Turn it back on. Turn the steam back on. Turn the steam back on then.
[7996.98s -> 8006.62s]  Turn the steam back on. If that's the problem. Turn the steam back on. Can I check this body?
[8007.34s -> 8030.10s]  Oh shit. They're killing each other in there. Not much chance. All right. I'm going to wait
[8030.10s -> 8032.74s]  till he puts his face right here and I'm going to hit him right the fucking teeth through the door.
[8032.74s -> 8048.76s]  Is he eating him? Hey. Hey. Hey, you. I'm talking to you. Can I climb through? Can I get in here?
[8048.76s -> 8062.23s]  It's open. Can he throw grenades? Dude, I wish you could just whip shit. I would just throw this
[8062.23s -> 8069.82s]  at this guy's head. Okay. Well, whatever. Let's go and go up. Can't go that way because the steam
[8069.82s -> 8076.36s]  is there. He's eating. Well, whatever. I'll take, I'll take him. I'll just wait till I do a drop
[8076.36s -> 8107.82s]  down R1. I'd like you, Jerma. Thanks. What happened in there? I don't deserve this. Oh fuck. Steam.
[8108.78s -> 8115.26s]  Wait, is that like a fake steam? What the hell was that? How did that just pop up for a second?
[8115.26s -> 8128.06s]  All right. There he is. Right? He's right here. The guy's in here. Let's go. I have the high ground.
[8135.62s -> 8152.15s]  He's got a knife. No. No. Fuck you. Get away from me. Plunging attack.
[8156.94s -> 8183.56s]  It didn't work. Throw the steam on. Quick. Burn him. He dropped the knife. Wait. Why? Kill him.
[8188.02s -> 8197.06s]  Is he dead? Okay. He's dead. I want his knife. Where's that knife? The knife fell down here.
[8202.39s -> 8220.36s]  Give me that knife. It's right there. I want that fucking knife. Game sucks. Whatever. Say please.
[8221.24s -> 8225.38s]  This is, this is a real Halloween stream kind of game. Don't you think?
[8226.26s -> 8241.56s]  I bet it's late. All right. I made it. Like rats in a maze. Oh, this is going to be fucking
[8241.56s -> 8248.36s]  fantastic. Isn't it? I can't wait. Please give me a checkpoint because this is going to,
[8248.36s -> 8269.85s]  I know this is going to be horrendous. Uh, I have a weapon. I got a gear. So, all right. Turn this
[8269.85s -> 8279.16s]  off. What does this make it go? All right. Makes it go this way. I got to follow the rules.
[8279.40s -> 8299.69s]  Follow the rules or die. Skip lore. Okay. Then over here. And now what? How do I,
[8299.69s -> 8309.08s]  how the fuck do I get that turned off? Run through it. I don't think I can. I think it's going to
[8309.08s -> 8330.01s]  kill me. Oh, this is go down. 5,000 bits and a 50 fucking dollars came in from fat Batman.
[8331.06s -> 8336.26s]  Like that name. Thanks for the 50 bucks. They say, Hey, he said my message chat. So he knows
[8336.26s -> 8359.69s]  I like him more. He said my message. So he likes me more. Uh, well, I mean, everybody eventually
[8359.69s -> 8374.65s]  is going to be a one guy. You know that didn't say no. It just did. Where's your only fans.
[8375.37s -> 8381.26s]  We already went over that. That's not, I don't have that. What lies beneath. Okay. But hold on.
[8382.14s -> 8388.81s]  What's this thing? I don't know. Let's find out how far of a drop is it?
[8392.66s -> 8400.39s]  Whatever. All right. Let's dumb ass mazes. More dumb ass dialogue, please. Come on.
[8400.39s -> 8420.47s]  There's something to work with. It feels bad, man. It's a 2.6 maze that is that you make up
[8420.47s -> 8454.42s]  on my, my college GPA. What was your college GPA? Uh, I don't want to do this. I don't want to do
[8454.42s -> 8512.04s]  this. I'm done. This is a 2.7 puzzle. Shut up. No, wait, no, no, no. Go back to that.
[8512.04s -> 8523.46s]  Two point fucking seven GPA puzzle. Got it. What I can say. I didn't do it. No.
[8523.46s -> 8538.79s]  All right. Here they come. They're going to be running through the ballroom or the,
[8538.79s -> 8545.93s]  wait, I hear them starting and stopping. No, why is that? I need a checkpoint.
[8545.93s -> 8554.46s]  I'm not doing this yet. This is, I'm going to die. Super Mario level bullshit. No. Okay. So go.
[8561.02s -> 8585.14s]  Wait for me. This game is fucked. I know. Wicked fuck. You have made it into the heart of the
[8585.14s -> 8599.48s]  boiler. Throwing punches. Throwing punches. Why don't you say help me? Anyone out there? Help me.
[8599.48s -> 8607.11s]  Fucking punch you in the face. Somebody help me. I'm thick on my head. Minecraft Steve.
[8613.10s -> 8618.06s]  Bricks. Oh yes. Again, I gave us bricks in it. Oh, this became one of the best games ever.
[8618.70s -> 8624.36s]  This game has bricks in it. Thank God there's fucking bricks in this game.
[8626.25s -> 8644.68s]  Can't see. Oh, this guy's doing this. Holy shit.
[8655.48s -> 8668.89s]  Oh, that was so dumb. I have to do this shit again. Whatever. Hey, go away. One go one in one go,
[8668.89s -> 8675.56s]  please. Oh, good. It hit me. But who cares? How would that guy be able to see? He's chasing me
[8675.56s -> 8709.51s]  around. Come on, man. How hard is this? Oh, my chest. How would he not get shot by these?
[8716.54s -> 8741.11s]  Oh, don't shoot. I didn't know there were two shotgun trips. Oh, God damn it. Chest.
[8742.71s -> 8755.13s]  You got baked to death. Kind of. All right. In one go. Right. I can do it in one go just to prove I
[8755.13s -> 8762.22s]  can. Oh, it's tricky. But all right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here
[8762.22s -> 8770.30s]  he comes. Okay. Help. Yep. Okay. Where's the tripwire? Right here. Just arm it. Give me a brick.
[8771.82s -> 8807.82s]  All right. Now arm it. Come on. What? He punched me. Give me the brick. Brick.
[8807.82s -> 8835.35s]  Okay. Help him. I can't help him. Wait. Where is he? Where the fuck did he go?
[8836.65s -> 8849.72s]  Where is this guy? Where'd he go? Where is he? Hello? Why is he not here anymore? Where is he?
[8856.09s -> 8865.67s]  He tripped. Oh, he tripped this. We didn't even get to see him die. I've got to take a brick with
[8865.83s -> 8878.15s]  all this important. Holy fuck. I almost walked over that. Okay, we're good. That's all the traps.
[8878.15s -> 8900.92s]  I got the valve. Yep. Might as well take them all. Oh, please get out of here. What the fuck? All
[8900.92s -> 8908.07s]  right. Which one is it going to go into? I don't know. This one, I guess. Okay. Then down here.
[8908.87s -> 8916.23s]  No, it can be this thing and like this thing. Then wait, I got to connect this bullshit. Okay.
[8916.23s -> 8926.86s]  Hold on. No, no. There it is. Okay. I'll connect this shit. No, this way. Okay. Now get this. This
[8926.86s -> 8949.72s]  connected. Connected, I guess. I don't even know where it's supposed to be going. I hate this thing.
[8950.84s -> 9002.10s]  No, I want to... I got to connect these stupid fucking valves, but it's like,
[9002.10s -> 9007.67s]  which one is the right one? I don't know. It's wild guess time. It's not this one. Not that one.
[9007.67s -> 9039.54s]  Not this one. Not this one either. Not this one. It's this one. It has to be. It's right here.
[9039.54s -> 9049.88s]  Yeah. All right. That's stupid. Who made this dump? Why would you make it like this? All right. Give
[9049.88s -> 9070.95s]  me it. Give me it. Give me the key. Give me the key. Open the boiler. What? Open it. Didn't it just
[9070.95s -> 9085.42s]  say get the key from the boiler? Behind the boiler. What the hell did it even just say?
[9085.42s -> 9113.18s]  Okay. I like the furnace gate key. Is this a map in this game? That shotgun's freaking me the fuck
[9113.18s -> 9127.10s]  out. All right. Am I insane or did I get the key? Do I just keep going? I already got the key.
[9127.82s -> 9138.97s]  The way the fuck was the damn thing? Check my inventory. I don't even know how to do that.
[9143.74s -> 9158.18s]  It's in your body now. Oh, I don't know what I just did. Okay. All right. Well, what the hell
[9158.18s -> 9171.46s]  does it want me to do now? Objective. Behind me. Turning into Adam Sandler. What a stupid map.
[9173.22s -> 9181.00s]  I can't have an arrow pointing. Why does it have to be a star? Is this it? Why is it? Wait.
[9181.00s -> 9184.76s]  Why would I do the... What's the point of doing the furnace puzzle if this is just here?
[9186.39s -> 9198.86s]  What? God. Don't. Please give me a checkpoint. Please. Checkpoint. Please.
[9198.86s -> 9214.87s]  Please. Oh, I got to get out of here. Can I walk past this? I guess so. I don't know.
[9215.91s -> 9227.61s]  No, I got to go out here. Oh, please. Steam coming out. Can I go? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9230.41s -> 9244.84s]  Okay. Fine. Nice fucking YouTuber reaction there. I would say so. Okay. Now go right and then straight
[9244.84s -> 9257.61s]  and then hell. Okay. Am I going to get hit by this? Is that steam? I don't know what that is.
[9258.41s -> 9274.63s]  Is that steam? Is that going to kill me? I don't want to walk fucking by it. It's going to hit me.
[9275.43s -> 9303.85s]  Okay. Now we're going to go left. Okay. Got it. And then this way. I made it. I went sick.
[9304.84s -> 9307.48s]  Looks like you were quick enough to save yourself, but
[9308.12s -> 9311.80s]  thinking about yourself is what you excel at. Unlock the furnace room.
[9312.84s -> 9322.47s]  I got a checkpoint there. That's pretty good. Thank God. Let's get locked in. Of course I didn't.
[9322.47s -> 9337.51s]  All right. You have anything else for me? Here we go. Rescue Jennings Foster. Locate the furnace
[9337.51s -> 9347.16s]  room. Give me that pipe. Protect myself. Bolt this door. Can I? Or you'll end up reading this
[9347.16s -> 9360.65s]  eventually. Maybe. Wait, there's a syringe. I can syringe people. This is pretty awesome actually.
[9360.65s -> 9376.12s]  Okay. I'm keeping the syringe case file. Uh, you'll, if you pause the stream and just rewind,
[9376.12s -> 9405.96s]  you'll, you can read it. I'm going to try to steam clean this something. Okay. The lock. I
[9405.96s -> 9412.20s]  got to go, but love your term up. Have a good one. Good to see you again. Make sure you join
[9412.20s -> 9432.42s]  us next time. There's nothing even in here. What a waste of, waste of time. Waste of time.
[9432.42s -> 9437.54s]  Million viewers are gone. Can't be real. There's not a million people, uh, on Twitch.
[9438.18s -> 9450.15s]  Take the case file. Somebody else will read it. Where am I going now? All right. I need to go.
[9451.91s -> 9468.33s]  Where am I? I'm not even on the map. Here I am. There I am. Okay. Here we go. Step on glass. Use
[9468.33s -> 9499.38s]  them. Okay. Not bad. Not bad for my first day. Got a gun. I don't want to syringe you, but I will.
[9502.44s -> 9510.63s]  What's on his head? Why does he have like a little canister on his head? Is the guy going to explode?
[9510.63s -> 9530.33s]  Don't do it. Is he? I'm safe. Okay. What does it do? Oh, it closed on his head. Run. Run.
[9531.72s -> 9536.02s]  That was actually horrible. I can't believe I just got through that. All right.
[9536.98s -> 9541.58s]  Watch the glass, man. I wasn't looking up in the shock and going off in my face.
[9542.79s -> 9555.88s]  That's some fucking Tom and Jerry shit right there. Oh, let's see if I can get this.
[9558.31s -> 9569.43s]  And do a Tom and Jerry bit. First aid cabinet. I've so, I don't even need any items.
[9570.23s -> 9588.78s]  What's the point of me doing this? Three drugs, I guess. Bat. Do I still have syringe? No.
[9588.78s -> 9608.65s]  One time use. Okay. Furnace room this way. And here we go. What's my next goal? TV. That will
[9608.65s -> 9631.82s]  tell me that's not telling me anything. No tripwire, right?
[9649.66s -> 9654.58s]  What's he doing to this guy? Is he going to squish him? Okay. Here's what I think. If I'm
[9654.58s -> 9659.86s]  a diabolical sick fuck, he's on a plate and he's going to just on a piston, he's going to squish
[9659.86s -> 9664.66s]  him up into the ceiling like he's a fly with a fly's water, right? It's going to slowly go up
[9664.66s -> 9667.46s]  and it's going to scare the shit out of him. It's going to go really fast and stop and it's going
[9667.46s -> 9671.78s]  to, no, I'm not going to really, really slow, but we can fast to the ceiling. No, here we go.
[9671.78s -> 9675.46s]  I'm going to pull you back down all the way and you can, we'll sit there for like another 40
[9675.46s -> 9689.74s]  minutes or so. This is fucked up. This is weird that I'm saying this. This game suck. Oh, a camera.
[9692.14s -> 9700.63s]  Wait, don't, why would you do that into your own eyes? Picture is worth a thousand words.
[9701.43s -> 9721.16s]  The picture is, what does it say? I don't like that. Find the truth. It's a pharmaceutical company
[9721.16s -> 9732.38s]  that's going to blot you evil shit or something. No, this is, I don't like that. This sucks. Give
[9732.38s -> 9735.66s]  me the lighter instead. I'm going to need this though, aren't I? But I don't know what that means.
[9736.54s -> 9763.34s]  Am I missing something? What the fuck is that? That's very disorienting. Yeah, it is. Push and
[9763.34s -> 9774.86s]  pull your way forward. I need to even look at that. I can read backwards. Can you use the lighter?
[9774.86s -> 9780.39s]  Please God. I'm going to need this. I'll get another lighter. Don't worry. Push and pull your
[9780.39s -> 9798.60s]  way forward. I'm with the pig thing. Push and pull. Zet-y. Puppet. I puppet. What does it say?
[9799.40s -> 9812.95s]  All right, let's go. I'm going to pull this. What does it say? Cart. Yeah, I can't pull it or push
[9812.95s -> 9833.93s]  it. Push or pull your way to, I don't know. Wait, was it one of the, more than two? There's a few
[9833.93s -> 9854.18s]  of these. Oh, here we go. Oh, it's going to be like that traffic game. That was thankfully easy.
[9854.82s -> 9861.99s]  I'm just walking around up there. I'm going to run right for the camera right in the face.
[9871.22s -> 9894.49s]  Well, everybody coming? Hold it from the other side. That's going to happen. Every,
[9898.79s -> 9910.36s]  so glad there's an actual checkpoint here. Okay. It's so dark. I, even with the,
[9910.36s -> 9913.00s]  with the flash I wouldn't have been able to see this shit. Where is it? Right there.
[9913.80s -> 9924.41s]  There's another one. Is it set? Wait, set it. Okay. Set that one. Then I'm going to,
[9924.41s -> 9927.13s]  there's going to be a guy that breaks through and I'm going to run around the circle. There he is.
[9927.85s -> 9946.54s]  It's the psycho right there. Oh yeah. The door is open. Only one door open. Follow me. Wait,
[9946.54s -> 9955.51s]  he didn't even get hit by the mung that I put. He did. Wait, I have one minute to do this.
[9956.31s -> 9965.50s]  How do I get this guy to come out? 56 seconds. Wait, why does this guy have like a VR helmet on?
[9966.22s -> 9990.86s]  We have both so bad. It's like a JRPG. Miss fucking kidding me. Your time is up.
[9993.66s -> 10007.00s]  You'll see. Okay. Give me, wait, he's not dead. I think I got him. I think I got him. All right.
[10007.00s -> 10021.56s]  How do I, how do I get this guy out? Eight seconds until what? Eight seconds. Wait until he's
[10021.56s -> 10040.74s]  released. So what? This guy's like worse for wear than everybody else was. This is going to do
[10040.74s -> 10065.83s]  anything. Okay. I got the furnace for him. Okay. What? It's all right.
[10068.23s -> 10073.59s]  You aren't, I was, I was, uh, yeah. Fuck. I know I can't, there's nothing I can say about that one.
[10073.59s -> 10077.51s]  I mean, holy shit, dude, was that on purpose? No. I mean, I was trying to,
[10078.65s -> 10084.66s]  I was trying to say that thought it was a on, and I thought it was a on like this,
[10084.66s -> 10098.22s]  on like a cabinet or something. I don't know. I'm stupid. Talk to me. God damn it. I'm yeah.
[10098.22s -> 10113.42s]  Why am I just silent? Why wouldn't we want to work together? Oh no. One minute. Whatever will we do?
[10119.00s -> 10122.90s]  Can we fight through the door? I can't hit him through the door.
[10125.19s -> 10134.54s]  Where's the other guy? Oh, he's waiting. Fucking right next to you, dude.
[10141.58s -> 10149.08s]  Open the door. Okay. I'm going to be ready right when the door opens.
[10149.72s -> 10202.17s]  The timer up. Oh, it is now. I hit him right in the groin. Okay. Don't fuck around, dude.
[10202.17s -> 10205.61s]  Why is he taking a full step forward? Just wait. You see what I'm doing? I'm hitting A.
[10209.27s -> 10219.88s]  Jesus Christ. I hit him. I'm you. Okay. Hey, he does like this full step forward. I'm not
[10219.88s -> 10235.64s]  having him do that. Unlock the furnace room. Wait, don't fucking go fast. See right here.
[10235.64s -> 10242.86s]  This is what happened last time. I went to open this. See, it's like, hey, you can touch this.
[10243.42s -> 10250.47s]  That's what happened. See what I'm talking about here. Look at that bullshit. I thought I was
[10250.47s -> 10262.71s]  fucking mad. I'm back to normal. Now we're going to open the furnace door, the mannequin arm,
[10264.54s -> 10269.18s]  furnace door. Whoa, wait, check, check, check, check. Always check, check, check, check, check,
[10269.18s -> 10277.00s]  check, check. Fucking can't even play this game. I'm fucking about to just rage quit and leave.
[10278.68s -> 10302.63s]  Fucking come on. No. I have to do it again. Oh, just have you both come out already.
[10306.28s -> 10312.09s]  Okay. Look out. Oh no. Watch out. There's a bomb over here. Oh shit. What's that?
[10317.61s -> 10329.19s]  Come here. Guys, I can't. What? Okay. I'm going to. Okay.
[10337.27s -> 10341.43s]  Why would you put that in this game? What's the point of that? It's just there to
[10341.43s -> 10350.86s]  be like a joke. Same one. I know. You don't think I know this? What do you think? You think I'm not
[10350.86s -> 10356.84s]  paying attention to what's happening? I know. I get it. I'm not. I know. I'm trying to make this
[10356.84s -> 10392.30s]  not a reality. I just. Armin again. Quick. Armin again. Armin again. You had to have seen me do
[10392.30s -> 10412.23s]  that. Okay. We all have five IQ. 37 fucking seconds. No, please. Just end this shit. It's right here.
[10414.81s -> 10439.62s]  2.6 IQ. Okay. Come on. Is this like for pity to make it so you don't get overwhelmed?
[10441.14s -> 10473.03s]  You give me your pain. I was just not hurting. Okay. Okay. All right. There's no bomb or anything
[10473.03s -> 10484.60s]  here. Open fucking door. There is nothing here that can hurt me. Nothing here can hurt me.
[10485.32s -> 10492.36s]  Nothing here. Okay. Nothing here can hurt me. There it is. I gotta stop this thing from
[10492.92s -> 10498.76s]  sliding down into his body. All right. It got it. I don't. I shouldn't just run up there though
[10498.76s -> 10531.37s]  because. Well, go on. Do your intro. We're rolling. You even put an innocent man in jail for your
[10531.37s -> 10538.20s]  crime all to preserve your perfect life. Couldn't stop the guilt from eating away at you rotting you
[10538.20s -> 10547.19s]  from the inside. So unless the officer you involved in your crime can hold the blame.
[10547.19s -> 10552.95s]  We will see what you really have. No, you're dead, man. You're dead. He's dead. He's not going to live.
[10552.95s -> 10560.89s]  He's not going to live. It's through this. Jason, it's been a real pleasure being your friend.
[10562.17s -> 10578.76s]  Oh, hurry the fuck up. Hurry the fuck up. It's a complicated thing. Stop.
[10585.02s -> 10597.35s]  How fast do I have to do this shit? Not going to work here.
[10604.34s -> 10622.52s]  Fucking hurry. Go. Stop. There's one. All right. It's going back up. I got it.
[10623.24s -> 10643.13s]  Okay. Now this one. And then. Shit. Now. Just suck your stomach in. It can't be that easy. It's not
[10643.13s -> 10676.90s]  that easy. I'm going for it, man. Just relax. Relax. There's another one. Done. Oh, this
[10676.90s -> 10695.24s]  one's a little weird. All right. Damn it. It can't be that. It's simple. Can it? Come on. One of
[10695.24s -> 10721.78s]  these. It's got to work. Come on. No. Get. Go up. I can't. Wait. Can I go up from like.
[10725.85s -> 10730.01s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Why'd you tell
[10730.01s -> 10759.24s]  me to do that? Okay. Now I can. Come on. Up like this and then. Reach. That doesn't reach. Why?
[10759.88s -> 10773.82s]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. You're fine. All right. That's it. Right.
[10773.82s -> 10795.37s]  That's another one. Please. I got time. I'm hurrying. I'm going as fast as I can.
[10799.83s -> 10835.78s]  No. How is that not right? Give me control back. Then stop talking. Oh. Got it. Wait. What? No,
[10835.78s -> 10848.92s]  no, no, no, no, no, no. What am I doing? I went. I thought it was just for nothing.
[10854.57s -> 10860.57s]  Tap. You self-righteous son of a bitch. Easy, Jennings. You're just reacting to the shock.
[10860.57s -> 10870.65s]  Just calm down. You fuck. You fucker. You're the reason he picked me. You. Me? You killed a man.
[10870.65s -> 10876.81s]  You a murderer. He was homeless. He didn't have a family. He meant nothing to anyone. What about
[10876.81s -> 10881.77s]  the innocent man you put in prison? What about his family? What did you do? But he didn't have to
[10882.41s -> 10883.37s]  put an innocent man in prison?
[10905.37s -> 10905.93s]  Put him back.
[10912.97s -> 10930.86s]  I don't even want him about the steam. He'll figure it out. I need some help.
[10932.38s -> 10937.42s]  I got to get this camera out of here. The camera is the worst item in the whole game.
[10939.78s -> 10940.34s]  And here we go.
[10943.30s -> 10947.45s]  Before you are to do or test your faith,
[10948.01s -> 10958.89s]  continue blind with your sight intact. Make your choice quickly. When the timer reaches zero,
[10958.89s -> 10972.46s]  the bombs located all around you will detonate. Wait, what do you mean? Here's a path. Okay, this
[10972.46s -> 11021.18s]  one. Okay, so what? Am I supposed to not touch them? Did I just walk in a circle? Why? How are
[11021.18s -> 11040.14s]  they going to explode? Is it upstairs? Wait. Oh, wait. What the fuck is going on? That's right.
[11040.14s -> 11055.64s]  All right. I did it. One minute, 38 seconds left on the clock. There it is. Door sealed.
[11059.56s -> 11093.53s]  Wait, this is the beginning. How did I pick this one? Fucking hurry. What do you mean hurry?
[11093.53s -> 11108.46s]  This is the most disorienting thing ever. Oh, I have a map. Who cares? Just use the map.
[11109.34s -> 11132.89s]  No, no, you're not supposed to look at your map. Can I just have my head explode and just
[11132.89s -> 11161.50s]  pick the other door? This sucks. I'm stuck in a wall somewhere. Give me the other door. Fuck
[11161.50s -> 11171.35s]  this door. Give me the other one. Do you think when those explosions go off,
[11171.35s -> 11181.48s]  it saws upstairs in a chair and he like rocks? He's like, whoa. Where is he? You would feel that
[11181.48s -> 11186.46s]  everywhere in the whole fucking building. All right. I want to, let's go make your choice. Yeah.
[11186.46s -> 11190.14s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't do the one with the blind one. Oh, no, we're going this one.
[11190.94s -> 11199.32s]  Before you open your doors, each will test your faith. You continue blindly or face a greater
[11199.32s -> 11206.36s]  challenge with your sight intact. Make your choice quickly. Hopefully it's like four enemies
[11206.36s -> 11214.31s]  because that's not a challenge. Okay. Let's go this way. What's the greater challenge?
[11217.08s -> 11230.84s]  Nothing can be a greater challenge than that. Oh, no. I know how much you suck at this.
[11231.80s -> 11261.08s]  It's balanced over a board. No, I'm going to be squashed. It got me.
[11266.15s -> 11271.43s]  Sorry. That's way better. I don't care. It's fine. It's way better than the other one.
[11271.43s -> 11279.54s]  The other one's so bad. I wish I could skip this dialogue. Before you are two doors,
[11279.54s -> 11290.74s]  each will test your faith. Your sight intact. This one. Make your choice quickly. When the
[11290.82s -> 11299.22s]  timer reaches zero, the bombs located all around you will detonate. It's scary. Okay. Go.
[11300.50s -> 11330.97s]  Hey, good. All right. Is there a place where I can stop? Oh, shit. Oh, I don't know if I'm
[11330.97s -> 11339.88s]  in the right place. Don't wait. What the fuck? No way. What happened? Oh, come on.
[11341.59s -> 11352.38s]  Yeah, I was just blue. I was supposed to time that one. Why did it blow up your head? I don't know.
[11354.38s -> 11355.34s]  I leaned into it.
[11401.69s -> 11417.77s]  Okay. Is that enough room? Don't hit my arm. Holy shit. I made it. Okay. Good.
[11418.49s -> 11430.02s]  Now what? Wash your hands. Now what? Go over here. Nothing in here. What did I just take?
[11430.02s -> 11438.90s]  I don't know. This game is dumb. What happened? What did I just get? My hands. What did I just
[11438.90s -> 11471.53s]  get? I had to push. I knew what I got. Don't touch that. What? I got a coupler? Okay. Oh, yeah.
[11472.25s -> 11479.06s]  All right. Turn it off. Oh, okay. I'm not that bad at these. I'm pretty good at these.
[11480.02s -> 11498.47s]  There you go. Everyone's like, oh, he's going to fit. Nope. I don't know. There could be a
[11498.47s -> 11504.49s]  fucking bomb right there. I don't know, guys. What do you want me to do? What is that? It's
[11504.49s -> 11518.42s]  something in the... Pick up the... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where am I? Where am I going? Water bottle?
[11519.06s -> 11526.46s]  No, I want the water bottle. How do I get the water bottle? What does the water bottle pick up?
[11528.30s -> 11537.51s]  Okay. This is sealed. Go. I got to hurry. I know. Yeah. I'm going. There's a bomb. Find a key.
[11538.47s -> 11542.94s]  Find a key. I get it. I got a key. I got a pee really, really bad.
[11543.74s -> 11773.61s]  I got a pee really bad. I'll be right back. Take a pee break in a second. He has to clean the
[11774.17s -> 11786.39s]  pee up off the floor again. Where are you getting again from? What was the first time?
[11793.42s -> 11797.10s]  Somebody just walked around under there. Can I punch a flashlight with the hand?
[11797.82s -> 11812.94s]  You know what I was trying to say? What was that? Find a key to the utility door.
[11813.82s -> 11837.30s]  I'm so glad I have an actual flashlight. Open. Open. Yeah. Full health. That rat was huge. Yeah,
[11837.30s -> 11845.16s]  the rat was huge. What am I going to do about it though? Stunt trap schematics.
[11848.76s -> 11856.15s]  Okay. Ammonia. What do I do with the ammonia? And where's my gun? Where's my shotgun? Where's my
[11856.15s -> 11878.01s]  grenade? Got in here. Key in the toilet. Utility key. Tell the shit stain story.
[11882.78s -> 11885.74s]  Restore power to the security checkpoint gate and then enter the utility room.
[11886.38s -> 11893.85s]  Where's that utility room? It's over here. It's a pain in the ass to get back.
[11898.87s -> 11917.38s]  Paste file. Screenshot it if you want. Oh, a button. Doesn't work. Where am I going?
[11917.38s -> 11924.15s]  I need to go all the way around. Someone's going to jump at me or something, right?
[11924.15s -> 11933.48s]  Why the hell would they have this backtracking? Who doesn't love a good backtrack?
[11943.26s -> 11951.53s]  P story. I thought I went to the bathroom. P'd one time. P came out of me
[11952.65s -> 11956.65s]  every time that I go to the bathroom. I hope you're laughing at that one.
[11962.09s -> 11968.55s]  This is what happens to those who fail their tests or make the wrong choice.
[11968.55s -> 11975.35s]  Save this man, but you can save yourselves. Find the combination to open his cage and
[11975.35s -> 11981.69s]  reroute the power back to the two so quickly when he touches the water.
[11989.26s -> 11997.00s]  I need another number is okay. Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. Uh, what's in here?
[11997.64s -> 12001.96s]  Nothing. What is this? Oh, there's a number on the wall here. It's five.
[12002.20s -> 12018.68s]  Five, five, two, three, five, one, two, five, eight, two, uh, jigsaw. What the fuck is all this?
[12021.26s -> 12035.90s]  Eight, three, six, six, two, one, two, six, one, five, six, five, six, five, five, three, five, two,
[12035.90s -> 12040.62s]  five. Like I just got hit in the head with a wrench and somebody came over. How many
[12040.62s -> 12056.30s]  fingers am I holding up? Um, holding up three was five, five, six, three, five, six, five, three,
[12057.94s -> 12068.97s]  six, two, three, six, two, two, six, three, one, five, five, five. It's not five. How much time do I
[12068.97s -> 12096.26s]  have? Oh, I got ages. Okay. Stand on the weight. Eight, six. Okay. Six is a number. Okay. Uh,
[12100.34s -> 12153.90s]  three, four, two. That's not it. Seven, six, five, five, three, six, five, three, six, five, three,
[12154.46s -> 12167.86s]  six, twelve seconds. Four three, five. Go this way. What are you doing?
[12175.53s -> 12187.61s]  Sensitivity on this thing sucks. All right. Four, three, five. Let's go.
[12195.03s -> 12211.54s]  That fast, didn't I? Wait, I need, where the fuck am I gonna get one of these?
[12212.34s -> 12246.39s]  Kidding me. Uh, Google dance. Pixel is reusing traps. Uh, is it in the room here? No, what
[12246.39s -> 12266.29s]  What about right here? Reusing breath. Stupid. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Got it.
[12266.29s -> 12279.66s]  Re-route the power. Oh, security checkpoint up the stairs. Goodbye, Jigsaw. It's been fun.
[12294.71s -> 12295.71s]  Oh, TV.
[12304.71s -> 12311.71s]  It would have easily been disabled by police procedure, but those procedures were ignored.
[12311.71s -> 12313.71s]  Who do you think ignored them?
[12313.71s -> 12319.71s]  It's the walking into the explosive trap. I killed him ironically, is what someone said.
[12321.71s -> 12323.71s]  I killed him ironically.
[12325.71s -> 12329.94s]  Alright, let's go.
[12329.94s -> 12338.45s]  Welcome back, detective.
[12338.45s -> 12358.07s]  Detective, what? Is that me? I'm dead. Is that me? Oh, my name's Todd? What's my name? Cap. Who's that?
[12358.07s -> 12371.25s]  Where are you? What the fuck are you doing? Why would you do that? What are you thinking? What's wrong with you?
[12371.25s -> 12387.18s]  Hey, any last words? Do it!
[12388.18s -> 12392.58s]  Please, you guys.
[12401.38s -> 12408.71s]  Oh, that doesn't happen to you guys.
[12408.71s -> 12413.04s]  Hey, you guys don't get... Oh, your head's squished.
[12413.04s -> 12417.22s]  Didn't he have a weapon? Where's his door shove?
[12417.22s -> 12432.19s]  Where's his weapon? He had a big bat. What the fuck is happening right now? Where's the bat he just had?
[12432.19s -> 12443.81s]  Finish the game already. Please, get me out of here. Wait, wasn't I already in here?
[12443.81s -> 12461.00s]  Locate the grave site. Please, locate the grave site. Toilet, uh, poopoo, haha. Ban that person for 10 minutes.
[12461.00s -> 12464.30s]  We gotta make an example out of this person. Ban them for 10 minutes.
[12464.30s -> 12471.19s]  Can I press the button? Oh, alright, I can press the button.
[12471.19s -> 12478.84s]  Dude, this is easy. This is fucking easy. This game is fucking easy.
[12478.84s -> 12496.10s]  Have you found your god? What happened in here?
[12508.22s -> 12511.23s]  Okay, that's...
[12518.62s -> 12522.62s]  See, I'm a good person. I will at least scroll so you can see it.
[12522.62s -> 12527.33s]  And if you want to roll back, you can read it.
[12527.33s -> 12543.78s]  Hustled room. What's that? Oh, somebody opened it.
[12543.78s -> 12549.78s]  Glass everywhere, please. Ooh, utility. Open this. I don't have... I need a circuit thing.
[12558.48s -> 12566.76s]  Oh, how far is this guy's reach?
[12566.76s -> 12573.47s]  A gun? Give me that gun. No, give me that gun. Give me that gun.
[12573.47s -> 12583.66s]  Why are you waiting for me to come down here? Only enough for me. Give me that gun.
[12583.66s -> 12596.73s]  I can use this, right? Please tell me I can use the gun. Yes. Yes.
[12596.73s -> 12601.10s]  What do you mean there's only enough in here for you? There's five bullets in here, dude.
[12601.10s -> 12623.65s]  Alright, I got a gun. How do you fire the gun? Can I snipe somebody?
[12623.65s -> 12634.44s]  Shotgun shell. I wish I could get a shotgun. That would be amazing.
[12634.44s -> 12644.78s]  Okay, nothing in here. What's the point of this? A flashlight. I already have one.
[12644.78s -> 12657.47s]  Lockpick, okay. Ooh, achievement.
[12657.47s -> 12669.86s]  Scalpel. Wait, scalpel versus gun? Are you kidding me? Do I even have to make this fucking decision?
[12669.86s -> 12682.05s]  Read that. I have so many achievables.
[12682.05s -> 12687.34s]  Oh, there was just a knife in here? Waste of time.
[12687.34s -> 12693.54s]  Now let's power this shit back on. I don't even have a map of this place.
[12693.54s -> 12707.24s]  Okay, on the only scalpel forever.
[12707.24s -> 12714.78s]  I'm going to try to use the gun wisely.
[12714.78s -> 12726.49s]  I keep walking on this glass. Does this guy have a healing on him?
[12726.49s -> 12734.54s]  Alright, I gotta be ready to fucking shoot somebody.
[12734.54s -> 12744.06s]  Alright. Yep, alright. What's wrong with me? What's going on?
[12744.06s -> 12756.86s]  What's that gas? Turn the gas off. I gotta turn the gas off.
[12756.86s -> 12769.36s]  Punch the door. Wait. Oh, please. Not this shit.
[12769.36s -> 12771.36s]  How the fuck am I supposed to get this?
[12771.36s -> 12774.86s]  Run out. Get out, get out, get out, get out. Heal.
[12774.86s -> 12776.86s]  Get out of the room. Get out, out, out, out, out, out of the room.
[12776.86s -> 12784.51s]  This door's sealed. I can't even heal. Do it. Drain the whole thing.
[12784.51s -> 12807.43s]  Oh, okay. I gotta have it be on here.
[12807.43s -> 12849.74s]  Fuck. There it is. Okay, that's that one.
[12849.74s -> 12869.86s]  Damn it. Heal. I can't see it.
[12869.86s -> 12878.70s]  I think this is it. I got it. Is it closed somehow?
[12878.70s -> 12889.55s]  This is fucking close to shit. I can't...
[12889.55s -> 12894.14s]  I don't know. I don't know. It's too fucking...
[12894.14s -> 12899.49s]  I'm dead. I'm dead. Just die. Oh, come on.
[12899.49s -> 12903.46s]  That was close too.
[12903.46s -> 12919.26s]  How far away was this? Imagine dying to pipe mania.
[12919.26s -> 12923.89s]  Yeah, imagine dying to fucking die.
[12923.89s -> 12925.89s]  What do you want me to tell you?
[12925.89s -> 12941.45s]  Where is this? How far away is this pipe wheel?
[12941.45s -> 12947.17s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yup, yup, yup.
[12947.17s -> 12949.17s]  Okay, remember this guy?
[12953.48s -> 12959.07s]  I'll take that gun. Thank you. Okay. Good. Let's go.
[12959.07s -> 12964.38s]  All right. Get this right.
[12964.38s -> 12977.98s]  What do you mean he's doing the fucking dial?
[12977.98s -> 12979.98s]  What are you talking about? I didn't just pick it up?
[12979.98s -> 12992.90s]  Okay, there it is. There's that one.
[12992.90s -> 12994.90s]  Let's go middle. Out.
[12994.90s -> 13035.59s]  Fucking already dead.
[13036.59s -> 13044.78s]  Take a fucking heal. What are you doing?
[13044.78s -> 13049.07s]  I hate these fucking...
[13049.07s -> 13051.07s]  It's not even a puzzle. It's just like dumb.
[13051.07s -> 13059.18s]  I have to get the fuck out of here.
[13059.18s -> 13061.18s]  Fucking delete this game. Delete it.
[13061.18s -> 13063.18s]  Remove it. Delete from the Xbox.
[13063.18s -> 13070.40s]  Eat, drink, paint dinner.
[13070.40s -> 13081.60s]  I'm going to drink it. How do I drink it?
[13081.60s -> 13083.60s]  Oh, not you. Not you.
[13083.60s -> 13085.60s]  Hey, guys. I have an idea. No.
[13085.60s -> 13088.80s]  I'm saying in the game, I just picked it up.
[13088.80s -> 13090.80s]  No. What the fuck are you talking about?
[13090.80s -> 13098.03s]  What?
[13103.43s -> 13105.43s]  All right. I've got the coupling device.
[13105.43s -> 13109.26s]  Here we go.
[13109.26s -> 13112.14s]  Go back in and break the wall.
[13112.14s -> 13124.54s]  No. I don't want to.
[13124.54s -> 13132.66s]  I don't want to.
[13132.66s -> 13135.61s]  I just walk into a wall.
[13135.61s -> 13139.77s]  All right. Checkpoint.
[13139.77s -> 13154.62s]  Don't fucking move. Don't move.
[13154.62s -> 13156.79s]  I've got a gun. As you know, I have a gun.
[13156.79s -> 13174.70s]  I'm ready.
[13174.70s -> 13176.70s]  Who holds a gun like this, by the way?
[13176.70s -> 13183.86s]  This is the way you hold a gun
[13183.86s -> 13186.87s]  if you're afraid of what it's going to do.
[13186.87s -> 13188.87s]  I've got to get a brace to shit.
[13188.87s -> 13190.87s]  All right. Hold on.
[13190.87s -> 13201.94s]  I'm ready. I'm going to shoot somebody in the head.
[13201.94s -> 13210.20s]  Uh-oh.
[13210.20s -> 13234.70s]  I got him. All right.
[13234.70s -> 13236.70s]  I see it this time. I see it.
[13236.70s -> 13238.70s]  I see it. Okay.
[13238.70s -> 13240.70s]  It's not going to happen.
[13240.70s -> 13242.70s]  Y'all were waiting for it. It's not going to happen.
[13242.70s -> 13251.27s]  I saw them. Pick it up.
[13251.27s -> 13254.58s]  A. A?
[13254.58s -> 13256.58s]  Okay. That was stupid.
[13256.58s -> 13264.84s]  No more of those, right?
[13264.84s -> 13266.84s]  No more.
[13266.84s -> 13269.59s]  I saw it. Wait. No.
[13269.59s -> 13271.59s]  That's an arm? Okay.
[13271.59s -> 13284.44s]  I want to go up.
[13284.44s -> 13286.44s]  I can't make a mollusk.
[13286.44s -> 13297.96s]  Somebody's up here.
[13297.96s -> 13321.86s]  Ooh, a lock pick.
[13321.86s -> 13329.48s]  Damn it. Damn it.
[13329.48s -> 13331.91s]  I have a flashlight. Do they run out of battery or something?
[13331.91s -> 13336.78s]  Why do they keep showing up?
[13336.78s -> 13339.34s]  Breakable wall? How do I just punch?
[13339.34s -> 13344.07s]  I don't want to shoot the gun. How do I just punch?
[13344.07s -> 13349.83s]  No. You dumbass.
[13349.83s -> 13353.48s]  I just want to punch.
[13353.48s -> 13355.48s]  How do I drop the gun? I can't drop the gun.
[13355.48s -> 13358.17s]  There's no drop gun.
[13358.17s -> 13363.67s]  Heavy attack? No. I just tried to pick up.
[13363.67s -> 13367.24s]  Oh, well.
[13367.24s -> 13369.61s]  Left bumper?
[13369.61s -> 13379.14s]  Oh. Left bumper. Where's the gun now?
[13379.14s -> 13384.38s]  Okay. I'm ready.
[13384.38s -> 13387.32s]  Gas.
[13387.32s -> 13391.42s]  Stunt trap.
[13391.42s -> 13399.10s]  RB cycle. Stunt trap.
[13399.10s -> 13405.24s]  Do I just throw it at people?
[13405.24s -> 13407.99s]  Can I make anything else?
[13407.99s -> 13413.10s]  Yes.
[13413.10s -> 13423.98s]  Don't make me start doing that.
[13423.98s -> 13427.82s]  I don't want to start doing that.
[13427.82s -> 13431.21s]  Where the hell am I going?
[13431.21s -> 13433.21s]  Out in the courtyard. The graveyard.
[13433.21s -> 13441.13s]  This way.
[13441.13s -> 13444.07s]  This glass is just like fine.
[13444.07s -> 13447.08s]  Do I have no heels?
[13447.08s -> 13450.22s]  I don't have a heel. How the fuck is that possible?
[13450.22s -> 13457.26s]  I used them all?
[13457.26s -> 13464.55s]  Here, my honey. Please come down.
[13464.55s -> 13466.55s]  I made your favorite food.
[13466.55s -> 13469.37s]  Well, prove that you are who you're saying you are.
[13469.37s -> 13474.62s]  And what's my favorite food?
[13474.62s -> 13477.11s]  Hmm? Why don't you prove it?
[13477.11s -> 13480.23s]  What is it? Pop tarts?
[13480.23s -> 13482.23s]  Nope. Wrong.
[13482.23s -> 13484.41s]  It's not my favorite food.
[13484.41s -> 13494.38s]  Okay.
[13494.38s -> 13497.45s]  Sorry. Wrong.
[13497.45s -> 13499.45s]  McChicken? You know, it's close.
[13499.45s -> 13508.22s]  How do I get in here?
[13508.22s -> 13512.06s]  Go that way? Down there?
[13512.06s -> 13514.06s]  What is that?
[13514.06s -> 13518.73s]  Locate the grave site.
[13518.73s -> 13520.73s]  Salmon? No. Close, though.
[13520.73s -> 13522.90s]  Actually, not even close. Not even remotely close.
[13522.90s -> 13524.90s]  Oh, I have to trigger the event.
[13524.90s -> 13537.51s]  Okay, who cares?
[13537.51s -> 13540.07s]  Yeah, that guy kills people.
[13540.07s -> 13543.46s]  I know. I know.
[13543.46s -> 13547.69s]  He kills people.
[13547.69s -> 13557.10s]  Is there anybody behind me?
[13557.10s -> 13560.42s]  It's got kind of loud sounds behind me.
[13560.42s -> 13562.42s]  You guys hear that?
[13562.42s -> 13573.16s]  McChicken?
[13573.16s -> 13575.16s]  I mean, I love McChickens. Don't get me wrong.
[13575.16s -> 13578.81s]  What is my absolute all-time favorite food?
[13578.81s -> 13580.81s]  What's my favorite food?
[13580.81s -> 13585.42s]  I think I used that help.
[13585.42s -> 13589.13s]  What's my favorite food?
[13589.13s -> 13591.13s]  Wait, I want to unlock that door down here.
[13591.13s -> 13594.20s]  Wobster? No. Gross.
[13594.20s -> 13599.90s]  Um...
[13599.90s -> 13601.90s]  It's probably chicken related.
[13601.90s -> 13607.78s]  I'm not sure it's chicken exactly.
[13607.78s -> 13609.78s]  It's probably chicken related, though.
[13609.78s -> 13612.98s]  This is a tough one.
[13612.98s -> 13618.79s]  It probably is like a good crispy chicken sandwich.
[13618.79s -> 13623.21s]  Bomb in here.
[13623.21s -> 13626.41s]  I need another...
[13626.41s -> 13632.10s]  What's that?
[13632.10s -> 13636.89s]  No, I don't care. I have a gun.
[13636.89s -> 13644.76s]  I don't need that.
[13644.76s -> 13646.94s]  Did I just waste one of those?
[13646.94s -> 13648.94s]  Can I take it back? Give me back.
[13648.94s -> 13651.56s]  Give that back.
[13651.56s -> 13657.18s]  Did I use it?
[13657.18s -> 13661.21s]  I think I used it.
[13661.21s -> 13663.21s]  Fucking hurry, hurry, hurry.
[13663.21s -> 13665.38s]  Oh, it's that thing.
[13665.38s -> 13670.18s]  I'm the McChicken guy thing, right?
[13670.18s -> 13680.81s]  Are we coffee pasta?
[13680.81s -> 13683.82s]  No, it's not.
[13683.82s -> 13688.81s]  Oh, gear, paint, and paint thinner.
[13688.81s -> 13690.81s]  All right, let me just get...
[13690.81s -> 13692.81s]  I have to do it, but I want the gun.
[13692.81s -> 13694.81s]  I don't want that.
[13694.81s -> 13699.66s]  I wasted a fucking gear.
[13699.66s -> 13703.43s]  All right, back out of here.
[13703.43s -> 13710.22s]  Bring that paint thinner.
[13710.22s -> 13712.22s]  All right, so now I just have to go back?
[13712.22s -> 13714.22s]  Do I have to just backtrack?
[13714.22s -> 13716.22s]  I mean, the guy was choking somebody up here, wasn't he?
[13716.22s -> 13719.74s]  What's the point of coming in here?
[13719.74s -> 13721.74s]  I didn't get anything new.
[13721.74s -> 13725.83s]  Is something else open?
[13725.83s -> 13729.35s]  I mean, I guess I have to go...
[13729.35s -> 13735.16s]  Where am I supposed to go?
[13735.16s -> 13737.16s]  In there somehow, but...
[13737.16s -> 13739.16s]  Go back?
[13739.16s -> 13748.82s]  How is he such a noob?
[13748.82s -> 13756.50s]  Who's hacked? Courtyard?
[13756.50s -> 13758.50s]  My stream got hacked.
[13758.50s -> 13762.66s]  I'm here.
[13762.66s -> 13769.13s]  Drop down here?
[13769.13s -> 13780.38s]  No.
[13780.38s -> 13782.38s]  We can't hear you.
[13782.38s -> 13784.38s]  You can hear me. I'm talking right now.
[13784.38s -> 13787.32s]  I did it. Oh.
[13787.32s -> 13790.26s]  What the fuck, dude? Come on.
[13790.26s -> 13792.63s]  What's going on here? Cut it out.
[13792.63s -> 13794.63s]  I'm not muted.
[13794.63s -> 13800.58s]  Now you're making me angry.
[13800.58s -> 13813.38s]  Now you're making me very angry.
[13813.38s -> 13815.38s]  I guess I could go back up here and look around.
[13815.38s -> 13817.38s]  Did I do everything up here?
[13817.38s -> 13823.40s]  Hit the mute.
[13823.40s -> 13825.70s]  What?
[13825.70s -> 13827.70s]  Fix it. There's nothing to fix.
[13827.70s -> 13834.41s]  Are you guys drinking?
[13834.41s -> 13836.41s]  Are you drinking or something? What's going on?
[13836.41s -> 13847.35s]  Let me go this way, I guess.
[13847.35s -> 13850.30s]  Holy shit.
[13850.30s -> 13852.30s]  I know I haven't been here yet because this is here.
[13852.30s -> 13856.18s]  Pick it up.
[13856.18s -> 13858.18s]  How close do I need to get to this before I can actually touch this fucking thing?
[13858.18s -> 13860.18s]  What the hell is going on?
[13860.18s -> 13862.18s]  I'm afraid to do this.
[13869.35s -> 13880.74s]  No shotgun or anything in here?
[13880.74s -> 13882.74s]  No. Alright, we're good.
[13882.74s -> 13888.36s]  Let's move. Careful.
[13888.36s -> 13893.86s]  That was so sloppy, but whatever. I'm here.
[13893.86s -> 13896.17s]  Your late partner holds the key.
[13896.17s -> 13904.62s]  Your late partner holds the key.
[13904.62s -> 13911.14s]  Oh shit, this guy squished.
[13911.14s -> 13916.90s]  I can't go that way.
[13916.90s -> 13932.26s]  He's laughing?
[13932.26s -> 13934.82s]  Why is the violin doing the bug thing?
[13934.82s -> 13936.82s]  You know, I was telling something fucked up was about to happen.
[13936.82s -> 13945.27s]  Here come the bug's violin.
[13945.27s -> 13949.37s]  Somebody's laughing.
[13949.37s -> 13956.28s]  No, I don't want that.
[13956.28s -> 13958.28s]  Fucking holy shit. I almost walked into it.
[13958.28s -> 13965.13s]  What's that?
[13965.13s -> 13976.39s]  Where is it?
[13976.39s -> 13978.39s]  This is kind of scary, I'm not going to lie.
[13978.39s -> 13995.99s]  It's actually kind of scary.
[13995.99s -> 14002.14s]  What bandages? Why did I take these?
[14002.14s -> 14004.50s]  I need these.
[14004.50s -> 14010.20s]  No head exploder.
[14010.20s -> 14014.86s]  Okay.
[14014.86s -> 14016.86s]  I'm ready, I've got my gun.
[14016.86s -> 14024.71s]  I'm not afraid.
[14024.71s -> 14031.74s]  Okay, I got him.
[14031.74s -> 14046.26s]  There's more of you?
[14046.26s -> 14051.94s]  Alright, who do I shoot?
[14051.94s -> 14057.96s]  Who wins this fight?
[14057.96s -> 14059.96s]  Oh, the guy with the bat won.
[14059.96s -> 14064.17s]  Now I'm fucking coming for you.
[14064.17s -> 14067.62s]  Wait, no, he's still alive.
[14067.62s -> 14086.23s]  Get out. What? Who's doing that?
[14086.23s -> 14089.56s]  Where are you? Who's throwing those?
[14089.56s -> 14091.80s]  Is he above me?
[14091.80s -> 14093.80s]  Okay, where the fuck are they coming from?
[14093.80s -> 14096.74s]  Elizabeth?
[14096.74s -> 14109.54s]  There you are.
[14109.54s -> 14112.17s]  Is there a thing? There is a thing.
[14112.17s -> 14115.62s]  Is there a thing right there?
[14115.62s -> 14118.95s]  Got the key. There's one right here.
[14118.95s -> 14121.13s]  Okay, don't touch that.
[14121.13s -> 14129.38s]  Okay, bye. I'll save her life.
[14129.38s -> 14131.38s]  Anybody going to heal?
[14131.38s -> 14138.81s]  Holy shit, nice.
[14138.81s -> 14140.81s]  Oh my god, I get to do this. Where is he?
[14140.81s -> 14144.71s]  Hey, eat shit.
[14144.71s -> 14159.54s]  What was that?
[14159.54s -> 14168.10s]  There was a fire underneath me.
[14168.10s -> 14175.46s]  Okay, I'm actually glad that happened.
[14175.46s -> 14183.46s]  Oh, right.
[14183.46s -> 14188.14s]  I forgot that you exist.
[14188.14s -> 14193.70s]  Shoot him.
[14193.70s -> 14195.70s]  Fuck you. Get away from me.
[14195.70s -> 14198.39s]  Okay, let's go.
[14198.39s -> 14201.85s]  Don't just jump down.
[14201.85s -> 14218.02s]  Stunt trap.
[14218.02s -> 14220.02s]  How do I use the stun trap?
[14220.02s -> 14222.02s]  Alright, shoot him. Get up this time.
[14222.02s -> 14226.31s]  Did it actually go right?
[14226.31s -> 14228.31s]  Okay, this is fucking stupid.
[14228.31s -> 14236.63s]  Where's the molotovs?
[14236.63s -> 14240.26s]  Where's the molotovs?
[14240.26s -> 14256.58s]  They're like a case of them.
[14256.58s -> 14258.58s]  By the way, I got just lucky last time
[14258.58s -> 14260.58s]  because I ended up opening the right box.
[14260.58s -> 14262.58s]  You have to pick up the box that's on the right grave.
[14262.58s -> 14264.58s]  I didn't even look last time.
[14264.58s -> 14266.58s]  Did I? No, I didn't.
[14266.58s -> 14273.99s]  I just opened one.
[14273.99s -> 14282.50s]  Alright, we have our...
[14282.50s -> 14287.82s]  This is the final chance.
[14287.82s -> 14289.82s]  He's kind of getting sick of saying these lines.
[14289.82s -> 14292.70s]  Listen to how tired he sounds.
[14292.70s -> 14294.70s]  You gotta get the key.
[14294.70s -> 14296.70s]  Fucking, you know, whatever.
[14296.70s -> 14298.70s]  You're making this not fun anymore.
[14298.70s -> 14316.87s]  Oh, he's alive.
[14316.87s -> 14321.22s]  Alright, I just like...
[14321.22s -> 14323.22s]  I just like Vulcan neck pitched him
[14323.22s -> 14331.67s]  and he died.
[14331.67s -> 14333.67s]  Okay, don't fucking explode.
[14333.67s -> 14335.67s]  Don't get your head exploded.
[14335.67s -> 14338.36s]  There it is. Okay, disarm.
[14338.36s -> 14340.36s]  Now, what was the person's name?
[14340.36s -> 14347.96s]  Okay, I got molotovs.
[14347.96s -> 14349.96s]  Something Smith?
[14349.96s -> 14353.35s]  Something Sings?
[14353.35s -> 14362.49s]  No.
[14362.49s -> 14372.86s]  What the fuck?
[14372.86s -> 14379.96s]  There's another one. Watch it.
[14379.96s -> 14384.63s]  Jacob Schmidt? Director Stevens?
[14384.63s -> 14386.63s]  Okay, this is it.
[14386.63s -> 14391.24s]  I got the key to the Cedar Ward.
[14391.24s -> 14393.74s]  I'm ready.
[14393.74s -> 14396.10s]  I have five molotovs.
[14396.10s -> 14400.52s]  You have the key to Cedar Ward to save her life.
[14400.52s -> 14405.43s]  Got it.
[14405.43s -> 14407.43s]  Can I get a checkpoint, please?
[14407.43s -> 14415.05s]  We're completing that.
[14415.05s -> 14417.05s]  Search the Cedar Ward for Jigsaw's next clue.
[14417.05s -> 14420.50s]  Can I just walk through this?
[14420.50s -> 14433.82s]  What? The way that I said Jigsaw?
[14433.82s -> 14436.49s]  Who cares?
[14436.49s -> 14438.49s]  I said Jigsaw, I said it fast, whatever.
[14438.49s -> 14450.63s]  What's the point of this?
[14450.63s -> 14459.53s]  Stupid, what's this here for?
[14459.53s -> 14465.08s]  Why is this here? How can it happen?
[14465.08s -> 14467.08s]  Oh, that's not one. Yeah, I thought that was one.
[14467.08s -> 14471.94s]  This area contains violent patients.
[14471.94s -> 14487.50s]  Find shelter from the bombs.
[14487.50s -> 14491.66s]  Uh...
[14491.66s -> 14501.24s]  No, there's a bomb in here.
[14501.24s -> 14503.24s]  Wait, there's a guy in there.
[14503.24s -> 14509.82s]  There's a Minecraft guy in there.
[14509.82s -> 14511.82s]  What did that do?
[14511.82s -> 14525.11s]  I just powered something.
[14525.11s -> 14533.24s]  Sanctuary.
[14533.24s -> 14537.59s]  Did I miss something in there?
[14537.59s -> 14539.59s]  I tried pressing this button.
[14539.59s -> 14541.59s]  Oh, I had to be in the exact perfect location.
[14541.59s -> 14544.54s]  Okay, here we go.
[14544.54s -> 14546.54s]  Holy fuck, you just...
[14546.54s -> 14548.54s]  Alright, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[14548.54s -> 14551.16s]  Here we go.
[14551.16s -> 14553.46s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[14553.46s -> 14555.70s]  I just threw a bottle.
[14555.70s -> 14557.70s]  That wasn't a molotov cocktail.
[14557.70s -> 14559.70s]  It was just a glass bottle.
[14559.70s -> 14562.07s]  And I only had one.
[14562.07s -> 14570.25s]  Okay.
[14570.25s -> 14574.52s]  That was dumb.
[14574.52s -> 14576.52s]  Key pole. Uh, 838.
[14576.52s -> 14579.85s]  You just threw a piss bottle at him.
[14579.85s -> 14585.35s]  Oh, I don't have a weapon.
[14585.35s -> 14593.22s]  Or patience.
[14593.22s -> 14615.05s]  Do I have to wait for 40 seconds?
[14615.05s -> 14617.05s]  Close the door.
[14617.05s -> 14634.52s]  Now I have patience.
[14634.52s -> 14639.69s]  Holy shit, I did it.
[14639.69s -> 14657.08s]  Where's my key?
[14657.08s -> 14659.08s]  Ooh, a secret way to go.
[14659.08s -> 14671.10s]  Okay.
[14671.10s -> 14674.49s]  Gonna be in the toilet, right?
[14674.49s -> 14678.06s]  There it is.
[14678.06s -> 14682.55s]  That's really, really hard to not get done instantly.
[14682.55s -> 14686.78s]  Storage key.
[14686.78s -> 14695.03s]  Lock the storage door.
[14695.03s -> 14698.17s]  Okay.
[14698.17s -> 14705.51s]  Moving on.
[14705.51s -> 14707.51s]  I do have to say, I'm getting sick and tired of, um,
[14707.51s -> 14709.51s]  disarm the room full of cartoon dynamite.
[14709.51s -> 14713.99s]  You have no other tricks up your sleeve.
[14713.99s -> 14715.99s]  You ended his life.
[14715.99s -> 14718.94s]  Who saved yours?
[14718.94s -> 14746.01s]  How does Jigsaw call 911?
[14746.01s -> 14751.64s]  Does it just give two scenarios to the dispatch?
[14751.64s -> 14753.64s]  Also, bus full of senior citizens
[14753.64s -> 14756.89s]  is about to fall off a cliff
[14756.89s -> 14758.89s]  down on Fourth Street.
[14758.89s -> 14760.89s]  Are you safe?
[14760.89s -> 14772.90s]  All right, well, get me out of here.
[14772.90s -> 14774.90s]  First you took his father. Will you take his mother next?
[14774.90s -> 14776.90s]  What the brain?
[14776.90s -> 14784.76s]  Explosion rocks downtown.
[14784.76s -> 14791.86s]  Okay. Uh, you could read this.
[14791.86s -> 14794.10s]  Uh, wait, hell, this is about us.
[14794.10s -> 14796.41s]  Lead officer in the Jigsaw killer case
[14796.41s -> 14798.41s]  resigned yesterday due to unknown circumstances.
[14798.41s -> 14800.41s]  Shooting death earlier this week of his partner,
[14800.41s -> 14802.41s]  Detective Stephen Singh, is suspected to be a factor
[14802.41s -> 14804.41s]  in the resignation.
[14804.41s -> 14806.41s]  PAP could not be reached for comment.
[14806.41s -> 14808.41s]  PAP was a fine officer and a defender of the law
[14808.41s -> 14810.41s]  who will miss him.
[14810.41s -> 14813.61s]  Detective Mark Hoffman, a similarly
[14813.61s -> 14815.61s]  decorated officer,
[14815.61s -> 14817.61s]  will be taking over the lead position.
[14817.61s -> 14823.42s]  Okay, explosion tape, whatever it's called.
[14823.42s -> 14851.77s]  Uh, dear Mrs. Singh,
[14851.77s -> 14853.77s]  we have received notice from Stanworth Elementary
[14853.77s -> 14855.77s]  that you have not responded to concerns
[14855.77s -> 14857.77s]  raised by your son Franklin's school counselor.
[14857.77s -> 14860.71s]  Okay, please
[14860.71s -> 14862.71s]  respond within 10 days.
[14862.71s -> 14870.07s]  Uh, kind of
[14870.07s -> 14872.07s]  this apartment is something going on.
[14872.07s -> 14875.46s]  Fire detective David Tapp
[14875.46s -> 14877.46s]  has antics got his partner Stephen Singh killed
[14877.46s -> 14879.46s]  which in my book makes him too dangerous to carry a gun.
[14879.46s -> 14881.46s]  Who knows when he plans to go rogue.
[14881.46s -> 14886.14s]  Criminal charges against
[14886.14s -> 14888.89s]  Tapp. Got my husband killed.
[14888.89s -> 14891.58s]  He's no better than Jigsaw.
[14891.58s -> 14897.27s]  Right, stick it to him. Some lore there.
[14897.27s -> 14906.41s]  Pfft, you
[14906.41s -> 14916.12s]  already there? I guess not.
[14916.12s -> 14921.69s]  What tapes?
[14921.69s -> 14932.57s]  Look at what you did in here!
[14932.57s -> 14954.78s]  Look at the true
[14954.78s -> 14956.78s]  destroyer of
[14956.78s -> 14959.66s]  lives.
[14959.66s -> 14965.67s]  It's me. Okay, let's
[14965.67s -> 14967.67s]  get the key.
[14967.67s -> 14975.61s]  You destroyed their lives.
[14975.61s -> 14977.61s]  I just tortured them to
[14977.61s -> 14979.61s]  death and killed them. Here we go.
[14979.61s -> 14984.47s]  Who said that? Here we go.
[14984.47s -> 14994.06s]  Looks like we're going in here.
[14994.06s -> 15012.55s]  Tortured to death AND killed?
[15012.55s -> 15014.79s]  Say it ain't so.
[15014.79s -> 15024.70s]  Yeah. He's leaving me notes
[15024.70s -> 15030.26s]  on how to make stuff. Jigsaw,
[15030.26s -> 15033.02s]  you know, you could just be a
[15033.02s -> 15037.10s]  DM.
[15037.10s -> 15039.10s]  I feel like that's a good avenue for you.
[15039.10s -> 15041.10s]  You don't have to do all this fucking weird shit.
[15041.10s -> 15046.28s]  Wingless angels
[15046.28s -> 15049.29s]  must fall. Wingless
[15049.29s -> 15053.26s]  angels must fall.
[15053.26s -> 15061.94s]  Sure. Okay.
[15061.94s -> 15068.54s]  What was that? Is somebody here?
[15068.54s -> 15070.54s]  Nothing to the work. I need a
[15070.54s -> 15072.54s]  weapon. Oh, there's
[15072.54s -> 15074.54s]  a weapon. Am I
[15074.54s -> 15076.54s]  safe? You and LSD
[15076.54s -> 15081.85s]  fucking messes you up.
[15081.85s -> 15088.06s]  Where is this person? Alright, I'm getting the bat.
[15088.06s -> 15090.06s]  He's not going to be there.
[15090.06s -> 15113.16s]  Skip steps.
[15113.16s -> 15115.91s]  Oh, you idiot.
[15115.91s -> 15127.43s]  Alright, now I got a
[15127.43s -> 15129.93s]  bat. Nothing scares me now.
[15129.93s -> 15133.32s]  I'm going to try DMT.
[15133.32s -> 15142.90s]  No. Alright, I'm ready.
[15142.90s -> 15154.98s]  I'm going to gear. Oh, it's
[15154.98s -> 15156.98s]  the TV's doing this shit.
[15156.98s -> 15159.67s]  Falling. Falling. Falling.
[15159.67s -> 15161.67s]  Angel. Alright, come on.
[15161.67s -> 15163.67s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Big money.
[15163.67s -> 15165.67s]  Big money. Big money. Come on. No whammies. No whammies.
[15165.67s -> 15167.67s]  No whammies. No, come on. Big money. Stop.
[15167.67s -> 15176.63s]  Ugh.
[15176.63s -> 15185.98s]  Oh, you are here.
[15185.98s -> 15187.98s]  Hey.
[15187.98s -> 15189.98s]  Can you open the door?
[15189.98s -> 15192.22s]  I'm being such a fucking weirdo.
[15192.22s -> 15201.80s]  It's a letter. There's a flashlight.
[15201.80s -> 15203.80s]  There's a lighter. No, it's a lighter. I don't want
[15203.80s -> 15205.80s]  a lighter. Why would I want a lighter right now?
[15205.80s -> 15207.80s]  It's so much worse.
[15207.80s -> 15214.78s]  Alright, open these doors.
[15214.78s -> 15223.08s]  Power this thing. Alright, well.
[15223.08s -> 15226.02s]  Let me time this up.
[15226.02s -> 15229.99s]  That guy's
[15229.99s -> 15232.36s]  not scary.
[15232.36s -> 15235.94s]  I need one of those stupid things.
[15235.94s -> 15244.57s]  I can't go in here.
[15244.57s -> 15246.57s]  It's just sitting in one of these dumb drawers that I didn't look in.
[15246.57s -> 15249.19s]  Is it in a drawer or something?
[15249.19s -> 15251.19s]  Where the hell is this?
[15251.19s -> 15259.19s]  Of course, right there. Give me a room.
[15259.19s -> 15264.12s]  Okay.
[15264.12s -> 15266.12s]  Let's do the same puzzle that we've done already
[15266.12s -> 15268.12s]  a thousand times except it's way bigger
[15268.12s -> 15280.60s]  now.
[15280.60s -> 15282.60s]  What the fuck am I supposed to do about this shit?
[15282.60s -> 15304.47s]  I
[15304.47s -> 15306.47s]  I hate this. I don't want to do this.
[15306.47s -> 15323.11s]  I'm done.
[15323.11s -> 15325.74s]  I'm fine. I don't want to do it.
[15325.74s -> 15327.74s]  I'm done. I don't want to do this.
[15327.74s -> 15332.84s]  I'm done. I don't want to do it anymore.
[15332.84s -> 15334.84s]  I'm done. Okay, I finished it.
[15337.34s -> 15345.21s]  Open this door.
[15345.21s -> 15349.30s]  Alright, now you can close your mouth
[15349.30s -> 15351.48s]  because you're irritating.
[15354.04s -> 15358.90s]  And I will take an upgraded bat
[15358.90s -> 15365.37s]  too, thank you.
[15365.37s -> 15367.37s]  Oh my god. Bonk.
[15367.37s -> 15371.45s]  That's funny.
[15371.45s -> 15373.45s]  Do I have to destroy the angels?
[15373.45s -> 15375.45s]  Wait, this is not an angel.
[15375.45s -> 15377.45s]  Oh, I do.
[15377.45s -> 15386.86s]  Okay, that was easy.
[15404.07s -> 15407.02s]  Okay.
[15407.02s -> 15409.02s]  Oh my god, a ton of money came in.
[15409.02s -> 15413.69s]  I just really lucked it.
[15413.69s -> 15415.69s]  Ishanji gave $70.
[15415.69s -> 15418.18s]  7,000 bits.
[15418.18s -> 15420.36s]  And this is, I believe, like an hour ago.
[15420.36s -> 15424.26s]  Enable face cam.
[15424.26s -> 15426.26s]  Slash enable face cam. Slash disable
[15426.26s -> 15428.70s]  flaccid lock.
[15428.70s -> 15431.83s]  Slash hug germa.
[15431.83s -> 15433.83s]  I don't know any of that. I don't understand
[15433.83s -> 15435.83s]  that line of Java
[15435.83s -> 15439.22s]  that you just put in. Okay.
[15439.22s -> 15444.22s]  Thanks for the 7,000 bits.
[15444.22s -> 15446.52s]  Thanks for the $70.
[15446.52s -> 15449.53s]  Is that why you guys are saying hack?
[15449.53s -> 15451.53s]  That's 70 fucking bucks. Thank you.
[15451.53s -> 15454.86s]  And then non-descript civilian
[15454.86s -> 15457.29s]  gave 10 community subs.
[15457.29s -> 15459.29s]  Thanks for the huge amount of money, guys.
[15459.29s -> 15461.29s]  Thanks for the gigantic pile
[15461.29s -> 15463.29s]  of money that you just dumped
[15463.29s -> 15465.72s]  right onto my lap.
[15465.72s -> 15468.15s]  I'm just like scooping it up as we talk.
[15468.15s -> 15473.38s]  Ah, thanks. What's that?
[15473.38s -> 15479.34s]  This guy's got a cube.
[15479.34s -> 15481.90s]  Alright, if you're going to explode
[15481.90s -> 15486.38s]  then just don't come over here.
[15486.38s -> 15488.81s]  Wait, if he punches me
[15488.81s -> 15495.66s]  is he going to blow up my head?
[15495.66s -> 15497.66s]  I drop this switch and boom.
[15497.66s -> 15513.37s]  Well, don't let it go.
[15518.68s -> 15551.77s]  Out of my way.
[15551.77s -> 15553.77s]  This thing's wired to blow.
[15553.77s -> 15555.77s]  It's going to blow us all up.
[15555.77s -> 15557.77s]  We're all going to die.
[15557.77s -> 15559.77s]  Press A.
[15559.77s -> 15561.77s]  Out of my way or
[15561.77s -> 15563.77s]  this thing will explode.
[15567.35s -> 15572.39s]  Careful with that guy.
[15572.39s -> 15574.39s]  If he lets go of that thing, we're all going to blow.
[15576.89s -> 15580.78s]  What the fuck is this in here?
[15580.78s -> 15584.42s]  Ooh. Alright.
[15584.42s -> 15590.12s]  Wait. Come over here.
[15590.12s -> 15599.64s]  Follow me.
[15599.64s -> 15601.64s]  Where is he?
[15601.64s -> 15603.64s]  Okay, now I've got to open
[15603.64s -> 15605.64s]  this door. Here we go. Ready?
[15632.57s -> 15634.57s]  Oh, he had a coupler.
[15634.57s -> 15640.84s]  If I get down there
[15640.84s -> 15643.46s]  how do I get down there from here?
[15643.46s -> 15653.06s]  This is crap.
[15653.06s -> 15656.39s]  I just have to do one.
[15656.39s -> 15658.39s]  Alright, well that was easy.
[15658.39s -> 15666.18s]  Anything else? I need health.
[15666.18s -> 15669.45s]  Alright, turn it off.
[15669.45s -> 15673.16s]  Turn the fucking thing off, man.
[15673.16s -> 15680.84s]  It's off, right? That could be me.
[15680.84s -> 15685.05s]  Alright. I wonder how
[15685.05s -> 15687.05s]  far ahead to the game is over.
[15687.05s -> 15689.29s]  Anybody have any idea?
[15689.29s -> 15695.37s]  How close am I to the end of the game?
[15695.37s -> 15709.00s]  I feel like I'm getting close.
[15732.49s -> 15734.49s]  Okay.
[15736.49s -> 15739.24s]  I mean, I think I'm here.
[15739.24s -> 15741.91s]  Tap. Tap in.
[15741.91s -> 15743.91s]  Tap in. Tap.
[15743.91s -> 15745.91s]  Tap time in. Time. Tap in.
[15745.91s -> 15747.91s]  Alright, I'm tapping in.
[15747.91s -> 15751.75s]  Rescue Melissa Singh.
[15751.75s -> 15758.84s]  Don't move. Don't move.
[15758.84s -> 15761.02s]  I'm coming up there and I'm going to
[15761.02s -> 15763.02s]  cut the blue
[15763.02s -> 15765.02s]  wire or whatever I need to do. I'm coming.
[15765.02s -> 15780.31s]  I'm going to do this elaborate
[15780.31s -> 15783.32s]  fucking puzzle. She's dead.
[15785.62s -> 15813.72s]  I'm an iron maiden.
[15826.71s -> 15828.71s]  Time for a lawsuit.
[15828.71s -> 15830.71s]  Okay. Magnetic
[15830.71s -> 15832.71s]  puzzle.
[15832.71s -> 15834.71s]  Move. What am I moving?
[15834.71s -> 15836.71s]  Okay. We're moving down. Then we're moving
[15836.71s -> 15840.68s]  down.
[15840.68s -> 15843.48s]  Oh. Okay.
[15843.48s -> 15845.48s]  Whatever. I skipped the steps.
[15845.48s -> 15847.48s]  He'll be fine.
[15847.48s -> 15849.78s]  And then we got to go over.
[15849.78s -> 15851.78s]  Then we got to go up, left, down.
[15851.78s -> 15853.78s]  And then right.
[15853.78s -> 15855.78s]  And then down. And then she's going to get
[15855.78s -> 15857.78s]  killed. I
[15857.78s -> 15860.92s]  think.
[15860.92s -> 15862.92s]  Okay. I did it. The game doesn't even
[15862.92s -> 15866.82s]  care. I win.
[15866.82s -> 15868.82s]  Hey, don't worry. He fucked up the programming
[15868.82s -> 15870.82s]  on this thing. I'm going to get you out of here.
[15870.82s -> 15881.38s]  Oh. That one worked.
[15881.38s -> 15897.43s]  Only one more. Oh.
[15897.43s -> 15899.43s]  This is the fastest probably anyone's ever done this in the
[15899.43s -> 15902.31s]  game. Okay.
[15902.31s -> 15904.31s]  This one. Whatever. We're going this way.
[15904.31s -> 15915.13s]  Alright.
[15915.13s -> 15921.02s]  Cool. Wait. That one worked.
[15921.02s -> 15925.48s]  That was a six, right?
[15925.48s -> 15948.71s]  How do I salvage this?
[15958.71s -> 15960.71s]  Fuck up, Jigsaw.
[15977.83s -> 15979.83s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[15979.83s -> 15982.33s]  Hurry, hurry. I'm only
[15982.33s -> 15984.33s]  four hundred pounds. Beat me more.
[15984.33s -> 15986.70s]  I'm up to five hundred
[15986.70s -> 15996.42s]  pounds. That's not enough.
[15996.42s -> 15999.30s]  Yeah. Is the game over?
[15999.30s -> 16001.30s]  Does escape suck? Anybody aware of that yet?
[16001.30s -> 16003.30s]  Oops. Sorry.
[16003.30s -> 16006.57s]  Oh.
[16006.57s -> 16008.57s]  Oh. Okay. You mean that
[16008.57s -> 16010.57s]  storyline wise. Okay. Let's go.
[16010.57s -> 16013.38s]  Escape with Melissa. Find the
[16013.38s -> 16019.34s]  clue. Alright, Melissa.
[16019.34s -> 16021.83s]  Follow me. Hey.
[16021.83s -> 16025.61s]  You good with the gun? I know a thing or two.
[16025.61s -> 16027.61s]  Oh. Awesome. The best line
[16027.61s -> 16029.61s]  that you could just say. Literally everyone, every
[16029.61s -> 16031.61s]  fucking person says that in every movie.
[16031.61s -> 16033.61s]  Every TV show doesn't matter. Every single
[16033.61s -> 16037.88s]  one. Nice.
[16037.88s -> 16039.88s]  And then they spin.
[16039.88s -> 16041.88s]  Flip, flip, click, load, snap,
[16041.88s -> 16043.88s]  snap, zip, flip. Oh, you know, you might.
[16043.88s -> 16045.88s]  You've used a gun, I think, before. Yeah.
[16045.88s -> 16048.31s]  I have. Whoa. Nice.
[16048.31s -> 16052.02s]  That's surprising to me. Your character
[16052.02s -> 16054.02s]  does not seem to be
[16054.02s -> 16056.02s]  somebody that would use a gun like that well. You've
[16056.02s -> 16064.66s]  surprised me. Thank you, every movie.
[16064.66s -> 16067.10s]  I'm sorry, David. You deserve this.
[16067.10s -> 16069.10s]  He said if I made it this far, I could choose
[16069.10s -> 16073.38s]  to leave. Oh, no. You're taking the headphones?
[16073.38s -> 16075.38s]  I'm not. Sorry. Oh,
[16075.38s -> 16077.38s]  please. There's a trip to Hawaii
[16077.38s -> 16079.38s]  at the end of this. You fucking idiot. Nice. Thanks.
[16079.38s -> 16081.38s]  I'm going to get the trip to Hawaii. You can go fuck off.
[16081.38s -> 16083.38s]  Yeah, take your, like, seventy-two
[16083.38s -> 16085.38s]  dollar headphones. I'm getting a seven-thousand
[16085.38s -> 16087.38s]  dollar trip to fucking Hawaii. What an idiot.
[16087.38s -> 16089.38s]  We're so close to the end, too. You're going to
[16089.38s -> 16091.38s]  take the fucking. Unbelievable. What a moron.
[16093.69s -> 16103.03s]  You paint these?
[16103.03s -> 16112.44s]  Right now, Jigsaw is sitting there
[16112.44s -> 16114.44s]  really getting a little nervous.
[16114.44s -> 16116.44s]  Oh, everybody takes
[16116.44s -> 16118.44s]  the fucking headphones.
[16118.44s -> 16123.50s]  That's getting close. I'm not really
[16123.50s -> 16125.50s]  going to have to pony up, like,
[16125.50s -> 16127.50s]  seven grand.
[16127.50s -> 16129.50s]  Usually they're dead
[16129.50s -> 16133.72s]  two hours ago.
[16133.72s -> 16145.94s]  I have a spiked bat.
[16145.94s -> 16147.94s]  More TVs. Okay.
[16167.91s -> 16169.91s]  You want to step closer to solving
[16169.91s -> 16171.91s]  the puzzle of catching me?
[16171.91s -> 16173.91s]  It is a dangerous game,
[16173.91s -> 16176.60s]  detective. Best games
[16176.60s -> 16178.60s]  always are. Ah, you know, I'll take the
[16178.60s -> 16180.60s]  headphones. Never mind. I'll take the headphones.
[16180.60s -> 16182.60s]  This is, ah, I don't care.
[16182.60s -> 16184.78s]  Locate the puzzle pieces
[16184.78s -> 16186.78s]  in pine, ward, find,
[16186.78s -> 16196.89s]  whatever. Let me guess.
[16196.89s -> 16199.58s]  Key in the toilet. Oh,
[16199.58s -> 16202.07s]  I wonder. Hmm.
[16202.07s -> 16204.07s]  Nope, man, this is something different.
[16204.07s -> 16206.07s]  This is a gear in the
[16206.07s -> 16209.02s]  toilet. So many little treasures
[16209.02s -> 16211.02s]  inside of the syringe
[16211.02s -> 16220.04s]  toilets. All right. There's somebody
[16220.04s -> 16222.04s]  in here that I got to save
[16222.04s -> 16225.62s]  or find or I don't know
[16225.62s -> 16229.21s]  where. I still have this thing on my
[16229.21s -> 16235.03s]  head.
[16235.03s -> 16237.91s]  Same shit every time.
[16237.91s -> 16240.86s]  I'll be honest.
[16240.86s -> 16242.86s]  Just let it be open. Just open it.
[16242.86s -> 16246.06s]  That puzzle doesn't
[16246.06s -> 16248.06s]  it's not even there for any reason.
[16248.06s -> 16250.06s]  Why is it there?
[16250.06s -> 16252.06s]  Just let me open the cabinet at some point.
[16252.06s -> 16254.06s]  Right? Like it doesn't do anything.
[16254.06s -> 16274.46s]  How that works.
[16274.46s -> 16277.58s]  Um, I mean,
[16277.58s -> 16279.58s]  okay, if it were me,
[16279.58s -> 16281.58s]  well, I could just leave without a
[16281.58s -> 16285.10s]  problem. Somebody's here.
[16285.10s -> 16288.36s]  Okay, are we ever going to find out who's the
[16288.36s -> 16290.36s]  person that's upstairs making all that noise?
[16290.36s -> 16297.08s]  Hold it from the other side.
[16297.08s -> 16300.92s]  Hold it from the other side.
[16300.92s -> 16306.22s]  And look at this.
[16306.22s -> 16308.46s]  I'm here.
[16308.46s -> 16310.46s]  I'm coming.
[16310.46s -> 16317.10s]  Yes. Am I the
[16317.10s -> 16320.68s]  I'm scary. I'm the scary
[16320.68s -> 16326.95s]  guy. Where are you?
[16326.95s -> 16337.18s]  Oh, what happened?
[16337.18s -> 16339.18s]  Did I? Why do I feel like I did that?
[16339.18s -> 16344.49s]  Hey, hey!
[16344.49s -> 16347.11s]  Get away. Get away. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me.
[16347.11s -> 16351.91s]  I'm sneaking through. Get away from me,
[16351.91s -> 16355.05s]  please. What?
[16355.05s -> 16358.70s]  Is it still blinking?
[16358.70s -> 16360.70s]  Is it still blinking?
[16360.70s -> 16363.26s]  Why did mine blink? Did I get
[16363.26s -> 16365.26s]  Wait, was that a shotgun thing?
[16365.26s -> 16368.20s]  Was it a tripwire?
[16368.20s -> 16370.76s]  No, it wasn't.
[16370.76s -> 16372.76s]  Was it?
[16372.76s -> 16374.76s]  Oh, come on.
[16374.76s -> 16378.28s]  It was? No,
[16378.28s -> 16380.28s]  shit. Are you kidding me?
[16380.28s -> 16382.71s]  That's so stupid.
[16382.71s -> 16387.58s]  Oh, my God.
[16387.58s -> 16403.45s]  I don't like the lamp.
[16403.45s -> 16409.78s]  Use the paint thinner bomb?
[16409.78s -> 16411.78s]  I don't even know how to use this.
[16411.78s -> 16414.60s]  RB. How do I use
[16414.60s -> 16417.22s]  it, though?
[16417.22s -> 16422.58s]  RB.
[16422.58s -> 16424.58s]  Like RBX
[16424.58s -> 16427.40s]  or something? Is this a juke classic?
[16427.40s -> 16429.40s]  Sick.
[16429.40s -> 16436.82s]  There are four traps in the entire game.
[16436.82s -> 16440.66s]  Use RB.
[16440.66s -> 16450.78s]  I'm doing it right now.
[16450.78s -> 16452.78s]  Jigsaw's plan here. Kill a hundred people just to convince
[16452.78s -> 16454.78s]  someone that they're not, that they're kind of a dick?
[16454.78s -> 16456.78s]  Yeah. I mean,
[16456.78s -> 16458.78s]  that's kind of every one of these movies.
[16458.78s -> 16469.85s]  It kind of stems from
[16469.85s -> 16471.85s]  you are a
[16471.85s -> 16475.18s]  Alright, roll this at him.
[16475.18s -> 16484.52s]  Throw it?
[16484.52s -> 16495.91s]  I got you.
[16495.91s -> 16498.22s]  You piece of shit.
[16498.22s -> 16501.10s]  Ah, you couldn't squeeze through the wall.
[16501.10s -> 16503.34s]  I could.
[16503.34s -> 16505.70s]  Wait, did he squeeze through the wall?
[16505.70s -> 16513.83s]  He's gone now. Not my problem.
[16513.83s -> 16520.30s]  Oh, my God.
[16520.30s -> 16522.30s]  If I didn't
[16522.30s -> 16525.43s]  stop.
[16525.43s -> 16527.43s]  If I didn't stop,
[16527.43s -> 16529.43s]  it would have happened again.
[16529.43s -> 16531.43s]  I hate that.
[16531.43s -> 16533.43s]  What a dumb thing to have in this game.
[16533.43s -> 16535.43s]  Sometimes you're just going to get your
[16535.43s -> 16537.43s]  head exploded.
[16537.43s -> 16549.64s]  The goal here, I don't know,
[16549.64s -> 16551.64s]  is to locate the puzzle pieces in Pine Ward.
[16551.64s -> 16556.57s]  I'm about to take the headphones.
[16556.57s -> 16559.13s]  So, God, I'm sorry.
[16559.13s -> 16561.13s]  What have I done? What do you do?
[16561.13s -> 16568.09s]  It's a heal.
[16568.09s -> 16570.09s]  It's like I'm kind of just pissing into the wall here.
[16570.09s -> 16587.16s]  Alright, what was that?
[16587.16s -> 16589.16s]  Oh, God, I'm sorry.
[16593.16s -> 16595.16s]  You don't have anything else.
[16595.16s -> 16597.91s]  Turn on the lights.
[16597.91s -> 16600.60s]  Okay, one.
[16600.60s -> 16602.60s]  Same shit again.
[16602.60s -> 16608.86s]  I just paint numbers on
[16608.86s -> 16612.63s]  walls in
[16612.63s -> 16614.63s]  a 207.
[16614.63s -> 16616.63s]  Oh, look out. I painted a number on
[16616.63s -> 16620.15s]  a wall.
[16620.15s -> 16622.97s]  You'll never find out what the solution is.
[16622.97s -> 16624.97s]  207.
[16624.97s -> 16638.33s]  Which one is this? 209.
[16638.33s -> 16640.33s]  It's 208.
[16640.33s -> 16642.33s]  It's going to be, I know, there's going to be something here.
[16642.33s -> 16644.33s]  It's just shooting the head.
[16644.33s -> 16651.18s]  What is his name? Remember his name?
[16651.18s -> 16653.18s]  You couldn't protect anyone.
[16653.18s -> 16658.79s]  Okay, let's go. Oh, come on.
[16658.79s -> 16670.18s]  Come on.
[16670.18s -> 16672.18s]  Bag of puzzle pieces. One, I thought that said 12.
[16672.18s -> 16674.94s]  This is going to be an unpopular opinion
[16674.94s -> 16676.94s]  and I cringe at the amount of letters this paper will
[16676.94s -> 16680.14s]  receive.
[16680.14s -> 16682.14s]  I think this is a Reddit post.
[16682.14s -> 16684.14s]  I'm going to propose the following. What if the jigsaw killer is good for our moral fabric?
[16684.14s -> 16686.14s]  If you follow the
[16686.14s -> 16688.14s]  methods of the jigsaw killer closely,
[16688.14s -> 16690.14s]  you might see what he's trying to do.
[16690.14s -> 16692.14s]  Make people better themselves. This is one of those comments
[16692.14s -> 16694.14s]  that you have to go all the way down and you have to click
[16694.14s -> 16696.14s]  the show deleted comment because it's got
[16696.14s -> 16698.14s]  minus 500
[16698.14s -> 16700.14s]  clicks on it.
[16700.14s -> 16702.14s]  It's been negatively downvoted so many times.
[16702.14s -> 16706.55s]  This person is fucking nuts.
[16706.55s -> 16711.54s]  I got one of two puzzle pieces.
[16711.54s -> 16713.54s]  Another one of these unpopular opinion pieces.
[16713.54s -> 16715.54s]  Lies corrupt. Remember being
[16715.54s -> 16717.54s]  slandered. How does it feel?
[16717.54s -> 16719.91s]  How does it feel? I don't know.
[16719.91s -> 16723.24s]  Okay.
[16723.24s -> 16727.34s]  The timer stopped? Oh, the timer stopped.
[16727.34s -> 16735.14s]  Nice. Why'd the timer
[16735.14s -> 16770.39s]  stop? Fuck off.
[16770.39s -> 16772.39s]  Lockpick to get a lockpick.
[16772.39s -> 16775.53s]  Give me a fucking break. Wait, somebody's talking.
[16775.53s -> 16780.12s]  I heard somebody.
[16780.12s -> 16782.49s]  Turn on the lights.
[16782.49s -> 16786.14s]  Find the room before the boom.
[16786.14s -> 16791.88s]  Okay. Let's keep going.
[16791.88s -> 16793.88s]  I didn't go in 206.
[16793.88s -> 16801.30s]  Just nails. Cool.
[16801.30s -> 16804.31s]  Wow. Should I even open
[16804.31s -> 16806.31s]  I don't think there could be a thousand dollars
[16806.31s -> 16808.31s]  in those and I don't even care.
[16808.31s -> 16810.31s]  Good. You found the pine ward piece.
[16810.31s -> 16812.31s]  Find the other pieces
[16812.31s -> 16814.31s]  in the oak ward to save life.
[16814.31s -> 16816.31s]  This is just the beginning.
[16816.31s -> 16818.31s]  This is just the beginning.
[16818.31s -> 16827.53s]  How does it feel to be judged for
[16827.53s -> 16840.39s]  auctions? Alright, what's the time to beat on this?
[16840.39s -> 16843.59s]  I'm going to look it up for me real quick.
[16843.59s -> 16847.05s]  There's a saw for the
[16847.05s -> 16850.50s]  Xbox 360.
[16850.50s -> 16852.50s]  This is five hours?
[16852.50s -> 16854.94s]  Six, five, six hours?
[16854.94s -> 16856.94s]  Oh shit.
[16856.94s -> 16859.82s]  Alright, I'm getting. Can I fall
[16859.82s -> 16866.73s]  in this? No, that
[16866.73s -> 16868.73s]  I didn't even
[16868.73s -> 16870.73s]  do that. Okay, whatever.
[16870.73s -> 16872.73s]  That's so dumb.
[16884.28s -> 16887.29s]  Literally one person
[16887.29s -> 16889.29s]  said five.
[16889.29s -> 16891.29s]  That is the name
[16891.29s -> 16893.29s]  you have given me.
[16893.29s -> 16895.29s]  Your words have changed how people
[16895.29s -> 16897.29s]  perceive me, regardless
[16897.29s -> 16899.29s]  of the truth. Now that your words
[16899.29s -> 16901.29s]  are useless, what is
[16901.29s -> 16903.29s]  left?
[16903.29s -> 16906.36s]  Hmm, I'll see if
[16906.36s -> 16908.36s]  I can come get you.
[16908.36s -> 16910.66s]  Six to seven hour game.
[16910.66s -> 16914.76s]  Well, that's to get the
[16914.76s -> 16917.51s]  vacation. You know, I
[16917.51s -> 16919.51s]  still have an opportunity to get the headphones.
[16919.51s -> 16933.38s]  You know what I'm saying?
[16933.38s -> 16935.38s]  That's the same joke. Well, it's
[16935.38s -> 16937.38s]  relevant to how much longer I want to
[16937.38s -> 16939.38s]  stream this game for.
[16939.38s -> 16946.73s]  I wish I had the gun
[16946.73s -> 16948.73s]  right now. Why can't I not have the gun?
[16948.73s -> 16953.40s]  Wait, stun trap. How do I
[16953.40s -> 16967.61s]  throw?
[16974.98s -> 16977.16s]  Nice.
[16977.16s -> 16979.66s]  You're the reason I'm here.
[16979.66s -> 16981.66s]  You did this. You're the reason.
[16981.66s -> 16983.96s]  You're the reason this
[16983.96s -> 16985.96s]  is all happening. I want that key.
[16985.96s -> 16993.06s]  What's wrong with him?
[16993.06s -> 16995.50s]  Why is he losing health?
[16995.50s -> 16997.99s]  Wait, he can come up here?
[17021.46s -> 17023.46s]  That's the game.
[17023.46s -> 17025.46s]  It's alright. Okay, well now I know
[17025.46s -> 17027.46s]  what's going on.
[17027.46s -> 17029.46s]  Stun trap. I got like a thing that said
[17029.46s -> 17032.73s]  activate the stun trap. How do I do
[17032.73s -> 17041.03s]  that?
[17041.03s -> 17043.27s]  Alright, it's a
[17043.27s -> 17045.27s]  stun trap.
[17045.27s -> 17047.27s]  I'm just doing this again. I'm going to cheese this
[17047.27s -> 17054.38s]  again.
[17072.79s -> 17077.45s]  Wait, wait. What?
[17077.45s -> 17079.45s]  Why is he starting to bugle very
[17089.37s -> 17091.37s]  This is really important for me to see if I can do this.
[17091.37s -> 17098.52s]  Is that hurting
[17098.52s -> 17105.82s]  him? Damn it, it's not hurting him.
[17105.82s -> 17107.82s]  I wish it was.
[17107.82s -> 17113.06s]  That's a flashlight. Fuck, he's kicking
[17113.06s -> 17119.72s]  my ass.
[17119.72s -> 17132.78s]  Alright, I got the health back.
[17132.78s -> 17135.02s]  Can I get his weapon?
[17135.02s -> 17141.54s]  He was very nonchalant about
[17141.54s -> 17144.36s]  that whole thing too. I'm going to get
[17144.36s -> 17146.36s]  that key. You're the reason I'm here.
[17146.36s -> 17148.54s]  I'm here because of you.
[17148.54s -> 17151.03s]  You're the reason why I
[17151.03s -> 17153.03s]  got into this situation in the first place.
[17153.03s -> 17155.98s]  I don't want the camera. Fuck the camera.
[17155.98s -> 17158.54s]  Explosive trap schematic.
[17158.54s -> 17188.15s]  What's in there? Never that easy is it.
[17188.15s -> 17199.16s]  Never that fucking easy is it.
[17199.16s -> 17258.28s]  What the fuck?
[17258.28s -> 17269.80s]  Really? That cog besides the
[17269.80s -> 17275.24s]  other cog. I don't even know what you're talking about.
[17275.24s -> 17279.53s]  Now I've got to connect this.
[17279.53s -> 17296.92s]  Done. Why is it so loud?
[17296.92s -> 17299.10s]  Because this game is not
[17299.10s -> 17301.91s]  good. I don't know.
[17301.91s -> 17303.91s]  I think this game expected me to run
[17303.91s -> 17305.91s]  around all over the place. Fight this guy.
[17305.91s -> 17317.88s]  Why do I still want to play this though?
[17317.88s -> 17320.12s]  This is strange. I shouldn't
[17320.12s -> 17322.12s]  want to still do this.
[17322.12s -> 17331.59s]  Turn this shit off.
[17331.59s -> 17333.59s]  Wait, why is this open? This was just
[17333.59s -> 17335.59s]  open. This used to be open. Why is this not open anymore?
[17335.59s -> 17339.62s]  That was open before. Why is it
[17339.62s -> 17345.06s]  closed? I closed it.
[17345.06s -> 17347.06s]  How did I close that? What did I
[17347.06s -> 17354.04s]  do? Oh, I pressed
[17354.04s -> 17362.17s]  this button. Tell me the next
[17362.17s -> 17364.98s]  part. How would I? No.
[17364.98s -> 17367.61s]  Alright TV, tell me what to do.
[17367.61s -> 17369.61s]  Zero seconds left.
[17369.61s -> 17377.03s]  Hello TV.
[17377.03s -> 17388.73s]  Tell me what to do. Why is the TV
[17388.73s -> 17390.73s]  not telling me what to do?
[17390.73s -> 17397.32s]  I guess I can go over here.
[17397.32s -> 17406.86s]  What is this for?
[17406.86s -> 17408.86s]  Turn this on?
[17408.86s -> 17413.53s]  Do I just turn it on? What if
[17413.53s -> 17416.54s]  I think somebody is out here?
[17416.54s -> 17427.29s]  Did I get them? Is somebody following me
[17427.29s -> 17429.29s]  around? Somewhere?
[17429.29s -> 17441.82s]  Where are they?
[17441.82s -> 17443.82s]  Is this all for the other guy
[17443.82s -> 17445.82s]  to immerse? Oh shit, yeah, big bits.
[17445.82s -> 17447.82s]  Big bits.
[17447.82s -> 17449.82s]  I think this is for that other boss
[17449.82s -> 17452.76s]  that I just was fighting.
[17452.76s -> 17457.88s]  We had 10,000
[17457.88s -> 17460.82s]  hits.
[17460.82s -> 17463.32s]  I fucked it up? How did I fuck it up?
[17463.32s -> 17465.88s]  It's 100 more dollars. It's fucking
[17465.88s -> 17468.89s]  insane. Thanks for the 100 bucks
[17468.89s -> 17470.89s]  slime for
[17470.89s -> 17475.10s]  10,000 bits.
[17475.10s -> 17477.10s]  Thanks for giving me and my friends so many laughs over the years.
[17477.10s -> 17479.10s]  I've been watching since early TF
[17479.10s -> 17481.10s]  tuber days. It's a long time.
[17481.10s -> 17483.27s]  The content's always been something me and my friends
[17483.27s -> 17485.27s]  quote all the time. I'm fucking quotable.
[17485.27s -> 17488.22s]  I never get to catch the streams, but just
[17488.22s -> 17490.22s]  wanted to donate and show my love for all the years of laughter.
[17490.22s -> 17493.35s]  Hey well,
[17493.35s -> 17534.25s]  here's a new quote for you.
[17534.25s -> 17537.83s]  Rome wasn't built in the day.
[17537.83s -> 17542.38s]  Go for it anyway. Don't step in that.
[17542.38s -> 17551.59s]  Sick ride.
[17551.59s -> 17556.20s]  All right.
[17556.20s -> 17558.20s]  It still wants me to fight a boss.
[17558.20s -> 17560.20s]  I've already fought him and I've already killed
[17560.20s -> 17565.70s]  him. I'm about to take the headphones.
[17565.70s -> 17567.70s]  Where are they? I'm about to take them.
[17567.70s -> 17587.61s]  I'm going to take the headphones I think.
[17587.61s -> 17589.61s]  Where does this want me to go? Just straight then bang
[17589.61s -> 17591.61s]  a left and go straight. I'm stupid. What's the point
[17591.61s -> 17593.61s]  of the glass?
[17593.61s -> 17596.23s]  I'm just going up.
[17596.23s -> 17604.92s]  Right, okay. Did I just do that?
[17604.92s -> 17607.61s]  Oh, wait.
[17607.61s -> 17611.06s]  Where's this person?
[17611.06s -> 17613.06s]  Why did I shoot him?
[17613.06s -> 17615.06s]  He was going to die anyways by walking into the fire.
[17615.06s -> 17622.04s]  You're going to spawn camp me?
[17622.04s -> 17624.04s]  You even let me come out of the spawn?
[17624.04s -> 17627.24s]  Oh, there he is.
[17627.24s -> 17631.02s]  Okay. I have to get the really
[17631.02s -> 17633.02s]  embarrassing head shot.
[17633.02s -> 17635.77s]  Remember doing this shit to people in
[17635.77s -> 17638.07s]  Team Fortress?
[17638.07s -> 17640.07s]  And the door would open, close, open, close. You'd kill everybody in there
[17640.07s -> 17642.07s]  and then there would be a sniper.
[17642.07s -> 17644.07s]  The door would open, boom! You got head shot.
[17644.07s -> 17646.07s]  It was insanely embarrassing because you were spawn camping.
[17646.07s -> 17649.98s]  This is so dumb to aim.
[17649.98s -> 17657.91s]  I didn't get him.
[17657.91s -> 17662.39s]  Is he still up there?
[17662.39s -> 17664.39s]  I can't see.
[17664.39s -> 17669.64s]  Fire, go away.
[17669.64s -> 17682.55s]  I don't have anything on me. Fucking scream.
[17685.11s -> 17687.11s]  I'm going to scream, I think.
[17699.78s -> 17702.34s]  Explosive trap.
[17702.34s -> 17708.87s]  Make two of them.
[17708.87s -> 17710.87s]  Gas trap. Make another one.
[17710.87s -> 17713.37s]  How the fuck do I use these things?
[17713.37s -> 17715.37s]  I don't even know how to use them.
[17715.37s -> 17726.06s]  RB. Yeah, but
[17726.06s -> 17731.82s]  L2 and R2?
[17731.82s -> 17741.61s]  That doesn't do anything.
[17741.61s -> 17743.61s]  Falsely accused.
[17743.61s -> 17755.38s]  Crank the sink.
[17755.38s -> 17761.32s]  What the hell was the point of that?
[17761.32s -> 17766.82s]  Key in the toilet?
[17766.82s -> 17774.12s]  There are no toilets in here.
[17774.12s -> 17780.70s]  Let's go that way.
[17780.70s -> 17786.65s]  How do I get over there?
[17786.65s -> 17789.40s]  Because we just go.
[17789.40s -> 17795.93s]  Easy bake oven waiting room?
[17795.93s -> 17800.73s]  See you on Friday.
[17800.73s -> 17812.82s]  Fucking hundred and fifty.
[17812.82s -> 17819.18s]  It's another one of those tax bracket increasing screams.
[17819.18s -> 17821.18s]  Holy shit, guys.
[17821.18s -> 17825.46s]  Ready dread.
[17825.46s -> 17827.46s]  Hundred and fifty dollars.
[17832.95s -> 17834.95s]  Just woke up? Did you have to restart the game again?
[17834.95s -> 17837.38s]  Yes.
[17837.38s -> 17839.38s]  I think when you were here, yeah, I had to restart twice.
[17839.38s -> 17841.38s]  The second time was
[17841.38s -> 17843.38s]  a trillion times worse than the first.
[17843.38s -> 17845.38s]  Because I was an hour into the game.
[17845.38s -> 17849.16s]  Thanks for the hundred and fifty fucking dollars.
[17849.16s -> 17851.16s]  Thanks for the hundred and fifty bucks.
[17851.16s -> 17854.10s]  Thanks for the hundred and fifty bucks.
[17854.10s -> 17856.10s]  Thanks for the insane amount of money.
[17856.10s -> 17863.70s]  I'm gonna nail this guy, okay.
[17863.70s -> 17865.70s]  He keeps wanting to give me the camera. I'm gonna take it.
[17865.70s -> 17869.16s]  Don't ask me why I'm doing this, but I'm doing it.
[17869.16s -> 17873.45s]  I'm taking the camera.
[17873.45s -> 17878.50s]  Where does it want me to go?
[17878.50s -> 17880.50s]  Locate more puzzle pieces in the oak ward.
[17880.50s -> 17896.12s]  Fuck, I missed the shot.
[17896.12s -> 17905.46s]  Do it again. How did you get up there?
[17905.46s -> 17907.70s]  Alright, the camera's the stupidest thing.
[17907.70s -> 17910.20s]  I'm putting it back.
[17910.20s -> 17912.76s]  I don't want it. It sucks.
[17912.76s -> 17917.94s]  I don't care. This thing eats total ass.
[17917.94s -> 17919.94s]  Why would you ever use this?
[17919.94s -> 17923.85s]  It wants me to use it so bad.
[17923.85s -> 17925.85s]  But no.
[17925.85s -> 17929.24s]  I can't even find the flashlight anymore.
[17929.24s -> 17946.63s]  Is it gone?
[17946.63s -> 17950.60s]  It was back behind that door. Pain in the ass.
[17950.60s -> 17966.09s]  Oh, it's the worst.
[17966.09s -> 17991.62s]  It's the worst. It's the worst.
[17991.62s -> 17993.62s]  We were the same person.
[17993.62s -> 17995.62s]  I believe that credit should be given
[17995.62s -> 17997.62s]  where credit is due.
[17997.62s -> 17999.62s]  You ruined the man's life
[17999.62s -> 18001.62s]  with your constant insinuations.
[18001.62s -> 18003.62s]  Words are
[18003.62s -> 18005.62s]  powerful, Oswald.
[18005.62s -> 18013.88s]  But so are actions.
[18013.88s -> 18015.88s]  Glad I still have this stupid ass camera.
[18015.88s -> 18020.49s]  This thing's going to get me killed.
[18020.49s -> 18028.22s]  You know what the hell happened in here?
[18032.38s -> 18037.74s]  This one doesn't look winnable.
[18037.74s -> 18039.74s]  That thing looks like it just kills you.
[18039.74s -> 18052.66s]  Closer than we think.
[18052.66s -> 18055.74s]  What if Jigsaw is one of the officers
[18055.74s -> 18057.74s]  that's tasked to catch him?
[18057.74s -> 18059.74s]  Say, detective. Tap.
[18061.74s -> 18064.04s]  They think it's me.
[18064.04s -> 18071.19s]  Wow, somebody else is the reason.
[18071.19s -> 18073.19s]  Not me this time. Interesting.
[18073.19s -> 18078.06s]  Ow. What did he say ow for?
[18078.06s -> 18082.79s]  Holy shit.
[18082.79s -> 18094.38s]  Who's going to win the game of
[18094.38s -> 18096.38s]  Rock'em, Sock'em, Robot?
[18096.38s -> 18107.51s]  He still thinks he's alive.
[18107.51s -> 18118.20s]  Over here.
[18118.20s -> 18120.20s]  No, don't even use a bullet on him.
[18120.20s -> 18122.20s]  Put the gun down.
[18122.20s -> 18124.20s]  I want to drop the gun.
[18124.20s -> 18131.37s]  Did he drop the gun?
[18131.37s -> 18135.08s]  Why use a bullet on him?
[18135.08s -> 18144.73s]  Where's the gun?
[18144.73s -> 18156.89s]  I was going to say that's
[18156.89s -> 18161.94s]  going to be really fucking dumb.
[18161.94s -> 18163.94s]  I fucking hate this game.
[18176.55s -> 18194.09s]  Did I get him?
[18194.09s -> 18215.21s]  Alright, gun. Let's go.
[18215.21s -> 18217.70s]  Don't step on this
[18217.70s -> 18219.70s]  stupid thing. Look, you can't see this shit.
[18219.70s -> 18221.70s]  Give me the lighter. Thank God
[18221.70s -> 18223.70s]  I can get rid of this stupid thing.
[18237.00s -> 18250.89s]  It's worth doing this every time because
[18250.89s -> 18253.77s]  you get the health. I need it.
[18253.77s -> 18257.66s]  Add.
[18257.66s -> 18260.66s]  Alright, let's move.
[18260.66s -> 18262.66s]  Now I gotta go to Oak Ward.
[18262.66s -> 18264.66s]  Is it this way or the other way?
[18264.66s -> 18267.35s]  Doesn't look like it's this way.
[18267.35s -> 18269.35s]  Somebody painted stuff here.
[18269.35s -> 18278.94s]  Why is this game
[18278.94s -> 18280.94s]  long?
[18280.94s -> 18282.94s]  It's not.
[18282.94s -> 18284.94s]  It's kind of not.
[18284.94s -> 18290.18s]  It's only been five hours.
[18290.18s -> 18292.18s]  I think it just feels that way because the game is
[18292.18s -> 18295.06s]  not good.
[18295.06s -> 18297.06s]  It's not very good.
[18297.06s -> 18301.48s]  But, you know,
[18301.48s -> 18309.42s]  it's fine. Okay, we need the last
[18309.42s -> 18311.42s]  puzzle piece and then I'm going to
[18311.42s -> 18313.42s]  assume that this is the climax of the game.
[18313.42s -> 18322.70s]  Are you kidding me?
[18322.70s -> 18337.66s]  What's the
[18337.66s -> 18339.66s]  password? Dude, can you just tell
[18339.66s -> 18353.03s]  me? Move them?
[18353.03s -> 18355.59s]  Am I going here?
[18355.59s -> 18365.50s]  Wait, you got
[18365.50s -> 18367.50s]  what is the password?
[18367.50s -> 18369.50s]  You already have the password.
[18369.50s -> 18372.70s]  What's the password? Somebody just have it?
[18372.70s -> 18374.70s]  What is it? I don't care. Fuck it.
[18374.70s -> 18381.61s]  I'll do it. What is it?
[18381.61s -> 18385.32s]  I don't care. What is it?
[18385.32s -> 18392.94s]  I'm serious.
[18392.94s -> 18394.94s]  Somebody has to just look it up, right?
[18394.94s -> 18404.41s]  74?
[18404.41s -> 18426.90s]  That's not it.
[18432.34s -> 18436.63s]  264.
[18436.63s -> 18438.63s]  Someone will have it eventually.
[18438.63s -> 18445.03s]  457.
[18445.03s -> 18451.75s]  556.
[18451.75s -> 18455.78s]  985.
[18455.78s -> 18463.98s]  7...
[18463.98s -> 18467.56s]  797.
[18467.56s -> 18472.81s]  775.
[18472.81s -> 18474.81s]  765.
[18474.81s -> 18478.78s]  702.
[18478.78s -> 18482.55s]  No, that's...
[18482.55s -> 18485.88s]  Okay, what?
[18485.88s -> 18488.06s]  I'm not trying to be funny. I just want you to tell
[18488.06s -> 18491.06s]  me the answer. I'm going to look it up.
[18491.06s -> 18495.29s]  I don't want to go get it.
[18495.29s -> 18500.60s]  No, it's going to take too long. Fine.
[18500.60s -> 18509.67s]  4...
[18509.67s -> 18511.67s]  You keep saying the same one. 435.
[18511.67s -> 18516.09s]  That's not it.
[18516.09s -> 18518.09s]  No, it's not.
[18518.09s -> 18520.78s]  It's in this link.
[18520.78s -> 18522.78s]  I tried to look it up. It's not in the guide. Yes, it is.
[18522.78s -> 18525.59s]  Rome wasn't built today, but go for it anyway.
[18525.59s -> 18527.59s]  Don't step in that.
[18527.59s -> 18531.43s]  Jeremy here. What?
[18531.43s -> 18544.55s]  I just tried to look it up.
[18544.55s -> 18548.20s]  Where is it?
[18548.20s -> 18550.20s]  Where is it?
[18550.20s -> 18552.20s]  It's going to be right here. Where is it?
[18552.20s -> 18554.95s]  I don't see it. Where is it? Where is the number?
[18554.95s -> 18556.95s]  Okay, number, number, number, number, number.
[18556.95s -> 18558.95s]  Where is it? I don't see a number. No number.
[18558.95s -> 18561.26s]  Am I locked in here now?
[18573.14s -> 18583.58s]  Cool. Okay.
[18583.58s -> 18599.38s]  Um...
[18599.38s -> 18606.94s]  What is this solve?
[18606.94s -> 18611.67s]  I can get to the door.
[18611.67s -> 18613.98s]  I win.
[18613.98s -> 18617.75s]  Wait, is it not...
[18617.75s -> 18619.75s]  Was I not supposed to do that?
[18619.75s -> 18636.18s]  Go, go, go, go!
[18636.18s -> 18638.18s]  What happened to the puzzle up there?
[18638.18s -> 18644.14s]  Did I miss it or something?
[18644.14s -> 18648.94s]  Rigid arms contain the code.
[18648.94s -> 18665.96s]  Sucks.
[18665.96s -> 18671.58s]  I turn this on.
[18671.58s -> 18678.60s]  Spotlight. See, this is what it looks like from my angle.
[18678.60s -> 18681.16s]  This is what it's like to beat the streamer.
[18681.16s -> 18683.91s]  You guys see from over here.
[18683.91s -> 18685.91s]  And it's like, wow, there he is, like on stage.
[18685.91s -> 18687.91s]  This is what I see.
[18687.91s -> 18691.86s]  My internet turn off?
[18691.86s -> 18696.01s]  Oh, hold on, let me fix it.
[18696.01s -> 18698.01s]  Hold on, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it.
[18698.01s -> 18700.01s]  Hold on, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it.
[18700.01s -> 18708.58s]  Hold on, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it.
[18708.58s -> 18713.64s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18713.64s -> 18716.71s]  Fiverr omega lol.
[18716.71s -> 18718.71s]  I gotta change my server.
[18718.71s -> 18720.71s]  It's all fucked up. It's the server.
[18720.71s -> 18728.46s]  Alright, I'm, hold on.
[18728.46s -> 18756.15s]  I will be back in ten seconds!
[18756.15s -> 18762.79s]  Hey, and we're back.
[18762.79s -> 18772.95s]  What's going on? Welcome back to the show.
[18772.95s -> 18785.02s]  We're here? I'm here, right?
[18785.02s -> 18787.02s]  Yeah, I'm good. Alright, yeah, we're good.
[18787.02s -> 18789.02s]  Sorry about that. I, uh, VPNed. I was using the server.
[18789.02s -> 18791.02s]  I was on fucking shit the bed.
[18791.02s -> 18793.02s]  Hey, you gotta fucking have that fucking good security though.
[18793.02s -> 18795.02s]  You know what I'm saying?
[18795.02s -> 18801.74s]  This is the last thing you heard me say.
[18801.74s -> 18807.54s]  206.
[18807.54s -> 18820.84s]  Are you kidding me?
[18820.84s -> 18824.84s]  Slander is not an easy thing to face.
[18824.84s -> 18827.59s]  Okay, goodbye.
[18827.59s -> 18830.22s]  Thanks.
[18830.22s -> 18833.67s]  Can I walk on this? What the hell is this?
[18833.67s -> 18837.90s]  Why did I end up?
[18837.90s -> 18840.14s]  Can I walk on that?
[18840.14s -> 18847.30s]  I feel like I can't.
[18847.30s -> 18849.30s]  What the fuck was the point of that?
[18849.30s -> 18851.30s]  That's the strangest thing I've ever seen.
[18851.30s -> 18854.18s]  God, that was just odd.
[18854.18s -> 18856.18s]  Abnormal.
[18856.18s -> 18860.28s]  Alright, back to that
[18860.28s -> 18862.28s]  door with the thing on it
[18862.28s -> 18864.28s]  that adds 206.
[18864.28s -> 18869.66s]  Now what? Is there a timer going up?
[18869.66s -> 18874.97s]  My god.
[18874.97s -> 18878.87s]  I can't be serious.
[18878.87s -> 18880.87s]  You can't be fucking serious.
[18880.87s -> 18888.09s]  God. Where's the valve?
[18888.09s -> 18890.09s]  Where's the valve?
[18890.09s -> 18894.70s]  I don't even have any
[18894.70s -> 18896.70s]  fucking healing.
[18896.70s -> 18912.81s]  I'm about to fucking die.
[18912.81s -> 18915.50s]  Turn it off. I can't.
[18915.50s -> 18931.54s]  I get it? Take the headphones.
[18931.54s -> 18933.54s]  They're right there too.
[18933.54s -> 18935.54s]  I could just get them right now. I could grab them
[18935.54s -> 18941.88s]  right now.
[18941.88s -> 18944.18s]  They're right there.
[18944.18s -> 18946.18s]  The headphones are right fucking there.
[18946.18s -> 18949.32s]  This is the minor
[18949.32s -> 18959.30s]  I could get the minor prize.
[18959.30s -> 18964.94s]  Prize right now.
[18964.94s -> 18973.38s]  Where did I just end up?
[18973.38s -> 18975.75s]  Where the hell am I going?
[18975.75s -> 18977.75s]  I don't know.
[18977.75s -> 18979.75s]  I have to go down.
[18979.75s -> 18983.46s]  What a dumb system.
[18983.46s -> 18986.15s]  Puzzles. Not even a puzzle.
[18986.15s -> 18989.48s]  It's just anxiety
[18989.48s -> 18991.48s]  I'm doing it first try. Open it.
[18991.48s -> 19001.70s]  No stop you
[19001.70s -> 19003.70s]  over sensitive piece of shit.
[19003.70s -> 19005.88s]  It changes from fucking on you
[19005.88s -> 19007.88s]  really fast. Where is the
[19007.88s -> 19011.27s]  right one? What the
[19011.27s -> 19013.27s]  fuck is happening?
[19013.27s -> 19024.02s]  Where is it?
[19024.02s -> 19026.33s]  It's a
[19026.33s -> 19038.55s]  game.
[19038.55s -> 19040.55s]  This is a three on rotten tomatoes.
[19040.55s -> 19043.37s]  I mean the movie
[19043.37s -> 19049.51s]  too. Both of them.
[19049.51s -> 19051.51s]  What was the point of this? To get another just to get
[19051.51s -> 19058.04s]  replace my gun? Really?
[19058.04s -> 19067.83s]  That fucking prize is looking kind of
[19067.83s -> 19070.07s]  good.
[19070.07s -> 19072.07s]  They can't be much longer.
[19072.07s -> 19074.07s]  Can't be much longer than this.
[19074.07s -> 19103.32s]  There's so much left.
[19103.32s -> 19107.40s]  They can't be.
[19107.40s -> 19109.40s]  When I get out of this
[19109.40s -> 19111.40s]  and I get to the
[19111.40s -> 19113.40s]  I have to get the second puzzle piece
[19113.40s -> 19115.40s]  key. Then I'll determine
[19115.40s -> 19117.40s]  if I'm going to take the prize or not. That's
[19117.40s -> 19119.40s]  on me to decide.
[19119.40s -> 19121.40s]  Where the fuck am I going? Use 206 to gain injury into the
[19121.40s -> 19123.40s]  objective room.
[19123.40s -> 19125.40s]  Where is that?
[19125.40s -> 19127.40s]  Where are we going here? That's death. I would have just
[19127.40s -> 19142.12s]  walked into that and died.
[19142.12s -> 19147.94s]  What is this?
[19147.94s -> 19149.94s]  Why am I laughing at that?
[19149.94s -> 19151.94s]  Up the stairs?
[19151.94s -> 19157.13s]  Does anybody have any
[19157.13s -> 19159.13s]  idea where this is supposed to be?
[19159.13s -> 19161.13s]  I don't remember anything.
[19161.13s -> 19163.88s]  A puzzle. Oh I wonder.
[19163.88s -> 19177.00s]  Wait I remember this part.
[19177.00s -> 19180.12s]  Isn't it like up here?
[19180.12s -> 19182.68s]  It's up here.
[19182.68s -> 19184.68s]  I out here and then
[19184.68s -> 19189.61s]  this way.
[19189.61s -> 19202.82s]  Click on down.
[19202.82s -> 19208.50s]  Alright.
[19208.50s -> 19211.32s]  Can't make anything.
[19211.32s -> 19213.56s]  Can't get out of this.
[19213.56s -> 19217.40s]  Squeeze.
[19217.40s -> 19220.66s]  Still playing this?
[19220.66s -> 19223.86s]  Go this way.
[19223.86s -> 19227.70s]  Why not have an arrow?
[19227.70s -> 19229.70s]  Why not have an arrow?
[19229.70s -> 19231.88s]  Why is there to be a star?
[19231.88s -> 19233.88s]  Why not
[19233.88s -> 19236.76s]  a pointing arrow?
[19236.76s -> 19238.76s]  I need the arrow to point in the direction
[19238.76s -> 19241.19s]  that I need to go.
[19241.19s -> 19243.19s]  I need a GTA thing up here.
[19243.19s -> 19245.19s]  Don't fall off this. I'll be extraordinarily upset.
[19245.19s -> 19253.51s]  Damn I want pizza.
[19253.51s -> 19257.03s]  206.
[19257.03s -> 19273.66s]  Bomb.
[19273.66s -> 19275.66s]  Shoot the lock. It doesn't work like that.
[19275.66s -> 19279.24s]  Alright.
[19279.24s -> 19281.24s]  Well he's dead. Good.
[19281.24s -> 19284.70s]  Why is the music still doing this?
[19284.70s -> 19286.70s]  Molotov. I have 5 Molotovs.
[19286.70s -> 19288.70s]  But I want the gun.
[19288.70s -> 19290.94s]  Let's just have fun with them for a second.
[19290.94s -> 19304.17s]  Is it it?
[19304.17s -> 19314.41s]  I got 2 of 2 puzzles.
[19314.41s -> 19316.41s]  Alright return with the puzzle pieces to the trap entrance.
[19316.41s -> 19318.41s]  Where the hell was that? Who knows?
[19318.41s -> 19321.93s]  I feel like I'm playing Resident Evil.
[19321.93s -> 19324.81s]  But
[19324.81s -> 19326.81s]  just not even close.
[19326.81s -> 19333.40s]  Have a good night.
[19333.40s -> 19335.40s]  Should we do a good night? Should I leave?
[19335.40s -> 19337.77s]  You guys want me to go?
[19337.77s -> 19339.77s]  You guys want me to leave?
[19339.77s -> 19342.46s]  Alright where the hell is the trap entrance?
[19342.46s -> 19349.05s]  Here I guess?
[19349.05s -> 19356.09s]  You're at the end.
[19356.09s -> 19358.90s]  I feel like I am at the end.
[19358.90s -> 19361.34s]  You know what? I'm definitely
[19361.34s -> 19364.47s]  can't give up now.
[19364.47s -> 19366.84s]  To get pizza.
[19366.84s -> 19369.02s]  Yeah I'm going to get a big pizza.
[19369.02s -> 19372.02s]  The biggest pizza you've ever seen.
[19372.02s -> 19378.74s]  30 minutes max.
[19378.74s -> 19380.74s]  Okay.
[19380.74s -> 19383.86s]  Quick I want a fall joke.
[19383.86s -> 19387.64s]  I don't think you're going to get one of those.
[19387.64s -> 19389.64s]  Fall joke requires a checkpoint.
[19389.64s -> 19391.64s]  That is within about 5 seconds of my last
[19391.64s -> 19394.63s]  attempt.
[19394.63s -> 19400.82s]  This way.
[19400.82s -> 19406.52s]  Backtracking bullshit.
[19406.52s -> 19408.95s]  Is it an explosive?
[19408.95s -> 19410.95s]  No it's just stairs.
[19410.95s -> 19422.15s]  I just saw a line and I freaked out.
[19429.29s -> 19431.29s]  Oh you're killing people.
[19431.29s -> 19433.29s]  You are absolutely murdering.
[19433.29s -> 19435.29s]  You're slaughtering people.
[19435.29s -> 19437.29s]  I can tell my man with your words.
[19437.29s -> 19439.29s]  That did nothing to you.
[19445.50s -> 19450.60s]  It's two heels I feel like.
[19450.60s -> 19452.60s]  Quick quick quick.
[19452.60s -> 19454.60s]  The gas is going to fill the room.
[19454.60s -> 19456.60s]  Where is it?
[19456.60s -> 19459.80s]  Where is it?
[19459.80s -> 19461.80s]  The gas is going to fill this whole fucking room.
[19461.80s -> 19464.55s]  Come on.
[19464.55s -> 19470.50s]  Where is it? I knew it. I told you.
[19470.50s -> 19472.81s]  I did it on purpose.
[19472.81s -> 19474.81s]  That was on purpose.
[19474.81s -> 19476.81s]  I knew it because I wanted to fucking.
[19476.81s -> 19480.39s]  Let's go. That was on purpose.
[19480.39s -> 19483.02s]  On purpose.
[19483.02s -> 19485.02s]  Wasn't pretending. On purpose.
[19485.02s -> 19487.02s]  Fucking the checkpoint is right there.
[19487.02s -> 19495.45s]  Where is this fucking thing?
[19495.45s -> 19504.09s]  Take it please.

[19510.44s -> 19512.44s]  I don't know man.
[19512.44s -> 19517.62s]  How the fuck am I supposed to know?
[19517.62s -> 19526.95s]  That's not right.
[19526.95s -> 19528.95s]  That's it.
[19528.95s -> 19532.66s]  What happened? Why is it not doing it?
[19532.66s -> 19536.57s]  Oh it's not correct.
[19536.57s -> 19546.68s]  Do another one. Do another one.
[19546.68s -> 19548.68s]  Do another one. X.
[19548.68s -> 19550.68s]  What are you doing? I'm hitting the
[19550.68s -> 19552.68s]  button X. The button fucking
[19552.68s -> 19554.68s]  X. X button.
[19554.68s -> 19556.68s]  Okay. You decide to do it now.
[19556.68s -> 19560.33s]  What happened here?
[19560.33s -> 19568.97s]  These fucking absolute dog shit.
[19568.97s -> 19579.72s]  Really? No.
[19579.72s -> 19591.37s]  Fuck. It's like right fucking
[19591.37s -> 19593.37s]  there. It's so close.
[19593.37s -> 19595.37s]  But it's just so fucking far
[19595.37s -> 19597.37s]  away at the same time.
[19597.37s -> 19610.15s]  Just kill me.
[19610.15s -> 19612.15s]  Am I just putting this in the game like
[19612.15s -> 19623.67s]  more than five times?
[19623.67s -> 19625.67s]  Imagine not going inside out.
[19625.67s -> 19631.43s]  Fucking
[19631.43s -> 19633.43s]  forgot it was in the room.
[19633.43s -> 19638.81s]  Fucking hate this.
[19638.81s -> 19641.43s]  I need that major prize.
[19641.43s -> 19643.43s]  I'm not vetoing it. No. No. No.
[19643.43s -> 19645.43s]  No. No. I got it. I got it. I'm gonna calm down.
[19645.43s -> 19648.12s]  I'm gonna settle down.
[19648.12s -> 19650.12s]  This is gas and booby trap.
[19650.12s -> 19652.12s]  This is not even
[19652.12s -> 19654.12s]  soft. This is fucking
[19654.12s -> 19656.12s]  Kevin McAllister does this shit.
[19656.12s -> 19658.12s]  Not Jigsaw.
[19658.12s -> 19660.87s]  Okay. Let's go.
[19660.87s -> 19666.18s]  Inside out.
[19666.18s -> 19675.08s]  I don't even know what inside
[19675.08s -> 19677.08s]  out should even be.
[19677.08s -> 19684.18s]  All I see is shapes. I don't see
[19684.18s -> 19686.36s]  anything else. All I see is shapes.
[19686.36s -> 19689.05s]  I don't see anything else but shapes.
[19689.05s -> 19691.05s]  It's just shapes. Nothing else.
[19691.05s -> 19693.48s]  Why would I go inside out?
[19693.48s -> 19700.97s]  Outside in? That's what I was doing.
[19700.97s -> 19706.86s]  Why would you tell me to go inside
[19706.86s -> 19710.70s]  out? That's not right.
[19710.70s -> 19717.46s]  That's not right either.
[19717.46s -> 19720.73s]  That's not right either. That's right.
[19720.73s -> 19722.90s]  This is the one. This is the one.
[19722.90s -> 19724.90s]  Okay. Alright. Alright. Alright.

[19732.15s -> 19743.54s]  Use it.
[19743.54s -> 19749.43s]  I don't want to do this again.
[19749.43s -> 19751.43s]  Okay.
[19751.43s -> 19753.43s]  I don't even care. I don't even want to look at it.
[19753.43s -> 19755.43s]  I'm going. I don't even want to look at it. I don't even care.
[19755.43s -> 19762.26s]  Where's my lighter?
[19762.26s -> 19767.83s]  Now what? Over here?
[19767.83s -> 19772.31s]  Okay. Now we have made it. Then go left.
[19772.31s -> 19779.99s]  Solve the puzzle to open the trap door.
[19779.99s -> 19781.99s]  Solve the puzzle. Solve the puzzle. Solve the puzzle.
[19781.99s -> 19783.99s]  Find the truth.
[19783.99s -> 19786.87s]  Okay.
[19786.87s -> 19792.76s]  Oh no. No.
[19792.76s -> 19794.76s]  No. No. Not these. Not one of these.
[19794.76s -> 19797.38s]  Wait.
[19797.38s -> 19799.38s]  It's a brainless
[19799.38s -> 19801.38s]  version. Thank god it's a brainless version.
[19801.38s -> 19806.76s]  Holy shit. I'm so happy
[19806.76s -> 19808.76s]  that this is just an absolute moron edition.
[19808.76s -> 19813.50s]  Where's this other piece of his face?
[19813.50s -> 19824.17s]  Where's his face?
[19824.17s -> 19826.47s]  Where's the piece of his face? Where's his other cheek?
[19826.47s -> 19833.64s]  There it is.
[19833.64s -> 19835.64s]  This is the wrong spot.
[19835.64s -> 19844.54s]  Okay. Hold on. Let me just get it right.
[19844.54s -> 19847.80s]  Okay. And then...
[19847.80s -> 19851.32s]  Saw on a wheelchair?
[19851.32s -> 19871.22s]  I don't remember. Is he?
[19871.22s -> 19880.70s]  Now we got to do... Where's this piece go?
[19880.70s -> 19883.00s]  Okay. Now we got to go right here.
[19883.00s -> 19885.69s]  And then...
[19885.69s -> 19893.94s]  His shoulder.
[19893.94s -> 19895.94s]  And then this piece goes over here.
[19895.94s -> 19897.94s]  No. It doesn't. Where's his shoulder go? Right here.
[19897.94s -> 19899.94s]  And then this piece... I don't know.
[19899.94s -> 19901.94s]  It's got like a...
[19901.94s -> 19923.19s]  I don't know.
[19923.19s -> 19925.19s]  And then this goes over here.
[19925.19s -> 19927.19s]  And this goes right here.
[19927.19s -> 19929.88s]  And this goes here.
[19929.88s -> 19932.44s]  It goes down here.
[19932.44s -> 19934.44s]  And this goes...
[19934.44s -> 19941.66s]  over here.
[19941.66s -> 19943.66s]  I win. Time to find the truth.
[19943.66s -> 19961.56s]  This is the end of the game. It has to be.
[19961.56s -> 19984.98s]  Four minutes for this.
[19984.98s -> 19987.80s]  Why'd you do that, man?
[19995.10s -> 20001.18s]  Wait. Who?
[20001.18s -> 20003.18s]  Who is supposed to do that?
[20003.18s -> 20007.34s]  Was he supposed to do this?
[20007.34s -> 20028.31s]  Get up. You're an asshole.
[20028.31s -> 20038.23s]  What do you think I'm doing?
[20038.23s -> 20040.23s]  Where's the...
[20040.23s -> 20042.23s]  Where's the power source?
[20042.23s -> 20052.79s]  It's complicated, Frank. Whatever your name is.
[20052.79s -> 20057.21s]  It's hard to do.
[20057.21s -> 20059.64s]  And then...
[20066.54s -> 20068.54s]  Why's everybody so rude?
[20068.54s -> 20077.69s]  I'm going as fast as I can.
[20077.69s -> 20081.78s]  Okay. And then this now
[20081.78s -> 20084.15s]  has to be changed.
[20084.15s -> 20088.18s]  Better than this.
[20088.18s -> 20091.38s]  This is not correct.
[20091.38s -> 20093.38s]  It's got to be...
[20093.38s -> 20098.38s]  Yep. You're alright.
[20098.38s -> 20100.87s]  Stay tight.
[20100.87s -> 20103.18s]  Hang tight there for a second.
[20111.88s -> 20114.12s]  Oh my god.
[20114.12s -> 20116.42s]  I should just shoot him.
[20118.73s -> 20120.73s]  This is a joke, right?
[20120.73s -> 20144.28s]  This is a joke?
[20144.28s -> 20146.28s]  This goes down.
[20146.28s -> 20148.28s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[20148.28s -> 20158.14s]  This goes like this.
[20158.14s -> 20160.14s]  This connects up here.
[20160.14s -> 20164.98s]  This goes like this.
[20164.98s -> 20166.98s]  This one goes like this.

[21913.54s -> 21916.78s]  I gave a message a few months ago, but I was going through some rough stuff
[21917.14s -> 21920.38s]  And they were you pushing me forward. Unfortunately times are still a bit tough
[21920.66s -> 21922.46s]  But they're better than they used to be
[21922.46s -> 21924.63s]  You're a fantastic human being

[21941.26s -> 21952.29s]  Nobody else's kind of egotistical, but thanks for the 300 bits. I really hope stuff turns around for you
[21952.71s -> 21962.37s]  Thanks for hanging out and that's a long time to even think that the e-clown guy here is still funny
[21963.05s -> 21965.30s]  Seven years is a long time
[21965.30s -> 21971.35s]  Thanks a lot. I wish you the best. Take care of yourself
[21971.99s -> 21976.43s]  He's a sicko. I'm a sicko sicko streamer. Why what the fuck are you talking about?
[21977.23s -> 21982.35s]  Stains thanks for three dollars Jerma. I need some help. Okay, let's see if I can help you during lightning round
[21982.79s -> 21985.73s]  Recently, I've been having dreams with a guy from dirty jobs shows up
[21986.47s -> 21989.45s]  Swinging a ball peen hammer at me. I think I have micro
[21990.51s -> 21992.74s]  peen issues
[21992.74s -> 22001.28s]  Do you happen to know how does make it stop? Did you just make me say micro penis you did?
[22002.18s -> 22003.34s]  Congratulations
[22003.34s -> 22012.96s]  Professor plaid. Thanks for the five dollars. Don't use weapons in this game. Fists are much better. It's actually kind of real. I think you
[22013.50s -> 22020.78s]  Jam may get for the three dollars. Hi Jerma, but I'll be asleep by the time you get around to reading this
[22020.78s -> 22025.98s]  I'm in the UK, but I'll be watching the VOD when I can I'm in the last week of University
[22026.26s -> 22030.73s]  Your VODs have been keeping me sane the first time I've been able to watch live
[22030.73s -> 22033.97s]  So I thought I'd send you some appreciation for what little money I have to celebrate
[22034.61s -> 22040.63s]  Cue you talking about not giving money, but shut up. You've done more for me than you'll know. Thank you for being you
[22040.89s -> 22046.32s]  All right. Okay. All right. I will shut up. Make sure you don't get an F in pickleball like I did
[22046.32s -> 22051.41s]  I wish you the best. Good luck and
[22052.53s -> 22054.45s]  potential, you know, you know
[22054.45s -> 22059.83s]  preliminary congratulations on your passing of your
[22060.43s -> 22064.65s]  University year what is pickleball was the most fun sport in the world?
[22065.33s -> 22071.16s]  Snoozing coffee. Thanks for 250. I recently finished God of War 2018. It was so good. Did you ever play it off stream?
[22071.20s -> 22074.68s]  I did and then I got four or five hours in
[22075.30s -> 22079.99s]  Maybe I was a little more than that. It's probably like eight hours in and I stopped
[22080.31s -> 22084.74s]  But that first like two hours is one of the most fun
[22084.74s -> 22090.34s]  I think I've ever played in a video game that was single-player that first hour of God of War was like holy shit
[22090.34s -> 22092.46s]  This is insane. This is most insane game ever played
[22092.98s -> 22097.34s]  And then it was okay, and then it turns it was just a video game after that, but that's not a bad thing
[22097.34s -> 22099.46s]  It was a very very high quality video game
[22099.90s -> 22105.76s]  Like I would probably say that if I had a
[22106.22s -> 22111.98s]  Brain that actually functioned well on a daily basis that that would probably be one of the best single-player games that have come out in
[22111.98s -> 22112.90s]  a long time
[22112.90s -> 22121.00s]  Although I only have about 12 hours potentially of experience in a game. That's about twice that I
[22121.40s -> 22130.22s]  Can only imagine all the perfect joke opportunities to do an Irish accent the rage induced moments during Valkyrie fights in the story
[22130.82s -> 22133.07s]  Yeah
[22133.07s -> 22137.24s]  This is bad. I have to tell you this I got halfway
[22137.24s -> 22139.24s]  I got like 12 hours in the game
[22139.44s -> 22147.12s]  And then I just stopped playing for like a couple months went by and then I just read every spoiler on like the Wikipedia page
[22147.80s -> 22157.69s]  Sorry, but whatever it's still cool. It's still a really cool game. I
[22159.90s -> 22163.82s]  Found my perfect keyboard low profile and quiet. It's 170 bucks
[22163.82s -> 22170.30s]  I have difficulty justifying an investment like that help get an Amazon basics fucking $10 keyboard save yourself
[22170.90s -> 22180.58s]  1700 percent wait is that correct maybe an Amazon basics fucking $9 keyboard who cares
[22180.98s -> 22193.42s]  They all do the same thing good keyboards are worth it
[22193.42s -> 22198.26s]  Yeah, but you could just get a $9 Amazon basics keyboard and fucking save $1,000 or whatever it was
[22199.02s -> 22205.38s]  Ex whimsical moose. Thanks for two feet. By the way, I'm a hypocrite asshole lying a fuckface. I have a course here
[22205.70s -> 22207.70s]  Listen to this you ready for this one. Oh
[22208.04s -> 22212.32s]  Whoa Amazon basic keyboard. What what's that? That's
[22212.88s -> 22215.19s]  That's not an Amazon
[22215.55s -> 22218.71s]  Basics keyboard anymore. Is it it's a course here fucking keyboard? I got it
[22218.71s -> 22220.75s]  I got the course here. I'm the one that I dumped the drink on
[22220.75s -> 22225.55s]  Yeah, I got that same one because it was my favorite keyboard. I got it. I cracked get an Amazon basics keyboard the $9
[22226.27s -> 22233.46s]  Thank you ex whimsical moose for the 250. Hello, Jeremiah first donation. I'm 28 years old
[22233.98s -> 22239.63s]  Happy why was I just gonna say happy birthday like today? Wait. No, I'm fucking that up
[22239.99s -> 22244.11s]  Just want to say not all your fans are these dang zoomers
[22244.15s -> 22248.05s]  I didn't grow up with you and you haven't saved my life
[22248.23s -> 22251.15s]  But you're one of the few e-clowns from when I was 19 or 20
[22251.19s -> 22257.48s]  There's still watchable and even funnier than you used to be even if you never beat stalker shadow of Chernobyl. Keep it up
[22258.20s -> 22259.44s]  also play
[22259.44s -> 22266.34s]  Exanima you played it in 2015. So I know you own it and it's updated a ton since then you can be a wizard now
[22266.34s -> 22274.87s]  I made a video on examina. Maybe I'll go back to it one day. Put it on the list
[22275.35s -> 22282.19s]  It's at least one person's birthday today. Yeah, they've already we've already seen them
[22282.19s -> 22283.83s]  they've already been
[22283.83s -> 22288.24s]  Here play that instead of finishing saw
[22289.38s -> 22293.17s]  that was a
[22293.17s -> 22295.17s]  common rider based
[22295.41s -> 22302.68s]  But ex whimsical moose gave 250. I didn't even read this
[22303.16s -> 22306.81s]  Hey, Jeremiah, I love this game and it's sequel for how funny bad it is
[22307.13s -> 22310.69s]  Also, you always tell us to keep safe, but I was wondering how you Kim and Otto are doing
[22311.05s -> 22313.97s]  Also, I'm hype about this weekend streams and stay safe chat
[22315.65s -> 22320.94s]  We're doing good. We'll see how it goes here over the next few weeks
[22321.74s -> 22323.18s]  Nevada
[22323.18s -> 22326.50s]  Stay-at-home order in Nevada is gone

[22330.06s -> 22331.22s]  reopening
[22331.22s -> 22338.12s]  Hopefully it's not gonna cause a big problem. I know some restaurants are starting to open up again a little bit
[22338.68s -> 22341.04s]  Some other businesses are starting to open
[22342.00s -> 22345.80s]  Casinos are all still closed. The strip is still closed and it will be probably for a pretty long time
[22346.52s -> 22348.76s]  Can't imagine any of those properties are gonna open up until
[22350.00s -> 22352.95s]  June July
[22353.39s -> 22355.39s]  Who knows it depends on how this goes?
[22355.71s -> 22363.34s]  Yeah, we're we're doing all right. We're doing just fine
[22364.06s -> 22370.32s]  Trying to stay as safe as possible try to take care of each other here of Otto, obviously

[22382.00s -> 22384.68s]  And I felt the need to tell you how famous you've gotten
[22385.44s -> 22389.91s]  Anyways, love your streams. They make me laugh no matter how much time has passed a
[22392.20s -> 22402.02s]  Fame wait, I didn't make the hun solo song. They played I'm hun, but I didn't that's not my song. I
[22405.29s -> 22408.17s]  danced to it like
[22408.45s -> 22410.65s]  three years after it was a meme and
[22411.72s -> 22418.55s]  Like after five youtubers made jokes about it. I think I was I was a little late to that party
[22418.79s -> 22425.95s]  No need to be so modest. All right, fine. I wrote the song. No, I didn't that's how I can't fucking say that
[22425.95s -> 22427.67s]  That's bad. I didn't do that
[22427.67s -> 22433.28s]  It's like I didn't and like somebody was like, well, I what if you what if you fucking actually wrote it?
[22433.28s -> 22435.28s]  And you were sitting here right now and you're listening to this asshole
[22435.64s -> 22437.80s]  Hey Wembley TTV. Thanks for the 250
[22437.80s -> 22441.08s]  I really hope that I'm never put it in a saw like contraption and
[22441.81s -> 22446.25s]  Jerma has to take over to save my life. I'd rather take my own chances. Thank you
[22446.61s -> 22453.16s]  Well, I opened the door and shot the guy in the last one. So I mean that you do it. There's a good point there
[22453.68s -> 22459.52s]  Hey, mostly toasted toast. Thanks for three dollars. I'm starting to feel like this game isn't about cutting things
[22460.64s -> 22466.40s]  Make me home. Thanks for three dollars Jerma. It's been forever since I watched live therefore
[22466.40s -> 22471.12s]  It's been forever since I've given bits. I must make the opportunity count. I will
[22471.76s -> 22477.09s]  And it's a dad. It's a blank to continue recording this message. Cheer another hundred bits

[22527.07s -> 22532.57s]  It's fucking good, I mean terrible
[22536.26s -> 22539.06s]  Okay, so but so see-through is terrible
[22539.10s -> 22545.22s]  But hell scream is the greatest character ever made and the best name ever made ever for any character ever
[22545.86s -> 22555.89s]  Okay, hell scream
[22556.69s -> 22561.09s]  See-through. All right, it's pretty bad. It's bad. It's worse than hell scream, but not that much worse
[22561.09s -> 22563.93s]  I would put up next to each other and you wouldn't build it would be hard to tell

[22734.76s -> 22736.76s]  I don't think this is accurate. I don't think this is correct
[22737.36s -> 22748.13s]  Yeah, sorry. I don't I can't I'd like to just type in his name. Let's just do that Neil Breen
[22751.26s -> 22759.13s]  No, no, I don't think so. No, no, no, no, I had to look like this now. So when I'm older

[22842.48s -> 22844.92s]  In second halo games are now on Steam
[22844.92s -> 22850.88s]  I know you said you'd never play more but their campaigns would be better than a shit co-op reach stream on the hardest difficulty for no
[22850.88s -> 22851.68s]  reason
[22851.68s -> 22854.60s]  Baby, if the curse is too strong though
[22854.60s -> 22859.08s]  I at least recommend any halo OST for when we need BG music for a stream
[22859.36s -> 22869.52s]  Or at least these serene songs playing for the Silent Hill and fable OSTs. I don't know why we do that. Wait, is this like
[22871.96s -> 22873.96s]  I have stopped
[22874.12s -> 22876.49s]  Doing that have you noticed
[22877.84s -> 22884.16s]  Recently games have come up. It's like oh easy normal hard insane and I used to be like, I have to play on hard
[22884.16s -> 22889.72s]  I'm a live streamer. I have to what are the other streamers played on insane mode? Oh, oh biting nails. I
[22890.52s -> 22894.04s]  Guess I have to know I don't care. I don't fucking normal. I don't give a shit
[22894.48s -> 22899.28s]  like if you be the game on insane and like
[22900.04s -> 22903.80s]  Other streamer be the game on insane. I'm good. I'm glad I hope you fucking win. I
[22904.88s -> 22911.04s]  At this I don't care. I'm not picking insane on saw. I'm not gonna do hard mode on
[22912.03s -> 22918.75s]  Halo OST. No, whatever. Well, that's the you target, but very very that's not the name of the game
[22921.30s -> 22929.06s]  Okay, right. I'm stupid. Hey gay wizard. Thanks for the five dollars, Jeremy
[22929.06s -> 22931.90s]  I want to say that I've been a fan since like 2014
[22931.90s -> 22936.15s]  But this is surprisingly my first time watching a live stream. Welcome, even though the game sucked
[22936.35s -> 22938.79s]  It was a blast watching you being part of chat
[22939.31s -> 22942.53s]  Your humor has gotten me through some dark days and I just want to say thank you
[22942.53s -> 22951.14s]  I wish I could donate more but anyways gay rights, baby. Yeah, I don't you don't have to give me money
[22951.14s -> 22959.20s]  I know I say this a lot but you you don't have it's not don't worry about it
[22959.20s -> 22962.16s]  I really hope some of you guys are not
[22962.76s -> 22968.33s]  Like saving up money to give me on stream. I hope that's not the case
[22968.85s -> 22972.45s]  They carry yourselves. They carry you shut up and take the money
[22973.29s -> 22985.46s]  I'm gonna but every so often I'm gonna make sure that I'm gonna tell you this I spent my food stamps on bits for you
[22986.32s -> 22987.68s]  Don't do that
[22987.68s -> 22995.51s]  Use it up eat food. But thank you though. I appreciate it refund all the donations then
[23001.90s -> 23006.62s]  Well, you guys think I have a button here that will just I press it and it just
[23007.02s -> 23012.56s]  Deposits all the money back to every human that's ever given money to the stream. That's no there are no refunds
[23012.96s -> 23018.08s]  Give me my money back. No, there's no refunds
[23018.20s -> 23025.84s]  It's in the twitch term services you buy bits and use them bits are consumed by the stream or the eats them and shitty shits out money
[23025.84s -> 23036.20s]  That's how it works. Hey goo berry juice. Thanks with three dollars. Hey funk King
[23036.76s -> 23048.56s]  What's with that? Why are people saying funk King? Is that a way to say?
[23049.28s -> 23050.24s]  fucking
[23050.24s -> 23057.83s]  Whatever it is, whatever
[23058.03s -> 23059.83s]  Hey funk King
[23059.83s -> 23062.00s]  Man, this game sucks, huh? I
[23062.24s -> 23064.44s]  Don't really have anything to add to that
[23064.44s -> 23069.52s]  So just thought I remind everyone of the good thing to come out of the saw franchise. What a classic
[23070.76s -> 23079.46s]  Wait, is this like a movie clip of like somebody getting that they had ripped off? Oh, I've
[23081.04s -> 23085.58s]  This is a it is a classic it is
[23088.51s -> 23102.77s]  Hold on, you know, let's uh this way it is a classic
[23104.07s -> 23111.68s]  Game skip
[23120.16s -> 23130.89s]  The video is so funny cuz like how did he fall down I want to play a little game
[23132.25s -> 23134.25s]  Like the whole bike explode
[23136.33s -> 23138.69s]  Like just disintegrates underneath
[23143.02s -> 23147.10s]  Like so how wheeling in and doing this shit you want to play a little game
[23147.18s -> 23153.90s]  You
[23157.21s -> 23161.88s]  Do that for the green screen I get like a tricycle
[23163.40s -> 23168.46s]  What a classic great stream. Nonetheless, I can always count on you
[23169.12s -> 23176.02s]  Chat take nothing and make it funny. You can always count on you chat to take nothing and make it funny
[23176.02s -> 23182.17s]  What do you mean chat? Well me I do that too. Don't I I do that. That's I do that sometimes
[23182.65s -> 23189.48s]  Hey Tobias, thanks for the thousand bits long time follower first time donator. Welcome and thank you
[23189.96s -> 23193.56s]  Today's my birthday. So we have a bunch of fucking birthdays. Everyone said that whose birthday was it?
[23194.04s -> 23198.24s]  It's been a bummer in quarantine, but your streams have been keeping me afloat in these trying times
[23199.08s -> 23201.08s]  Thanks for being a bright part of the crazy world
[23201.32s -> 23208.05s]  You've been make you better make Chad a birthday cake with the easy-bake oven. I don't even know what's in that box
[23208.05s -> 23211.24s]  I know this I think 12 recipes
[23211.76s -> 23217.24s]  That streams gonna suck by the way, I just I need to make sure I've laid that concrete down for you
[23217.80s -> 23219.80s]  I'm just going to make
[23220.54s -> 23225.55s]  Candies and cakes and pizzas and shit in an easy-bake oven. I don't know
[23225.55s -> 23233.00s]  I want to make sure you guys aren't expecting anything from that that could be birdhouse stream too and then eat it
[23233.00s -> 23242.23s]  No, I won't eat it disgusting. I'm way above that. But anyways, thank you for the thousand bits and happy birthday
[23242.23s -> 23249.73s]  I will make a birthday themed
[23250.29s -> 23256.50s]  Cake thing. What are you gonna do while the food is baking? Holy shit. I don't even think about that
[23256.50s -> 23263.41s]  I don't know like jumping jacks push ups and stuff like stretches. I'm gonna be careful. I don't like forget that it's in there
[23264.59s -> 23267.64s]  That might happen. All right, I gotta be careful. I got to have like a
[23268.20s -> 23275.07s]  Okay. All right. Hey tree fiddy. Thanks for the five dollars. Thank you German for everything on my birthday
[23275.07s -> 23276.99s]  You were the only person I felt like I had
[23276.99s -> 23282.77s]  Having you around made things not suck so much. It seems like that's the case every time you stream. It's the thanks, dude
[23282.77s -> 23288.33s]  I appreciate your drive and your dedication to the community. I wish words could describe how much you've made an impact on my life
[23288.33s -> 23290.69s]  From the bottom of my heart. Thank you and love you
[23291.41s -> 23301.34s]  That means a lot but I've mentioned this before and I want to mention it again
[23301.34s -> 23312.35s]  I really hope that you can take the steps necessary to try to improve your life and hope things get better
[23312.91s -> 23323.60s]  because I'm just a streamer on the internet and although I can
[23324.28s -> 23330.40s]  Hopefully be here to have fun and have a good time with the community. I can't necessarily
[23331.36s -> 23340.98s]  Fix any problems that anybody has and obviously I know that people aren't asking me to do that
[23341.44s -> 23344.51s]  And that's never something that was no one's ever like hey, by the way
[23344.51s -> 23348.39s]  I what I know that what this advice questions and stuff like that
[23348.39s -> 23359.54s]  But I just hope that you can find something else that can make you happy as well as me as well as this community because
[23360.28s -> 23362.76s]  That means that you're gonna get healthier
[23362.76s -> 23374.56s]  You guys are really feeding his God complex, but like again, I say like I say it again
[23374.60s -> 23376.60s]  I'm just a guy on the internet
[23377.00s -> 23383.04s]  That's just me. I'm just an e-clown and we're in an e-clown community
[23383.40s -> 23391.13s]  And I can't necessarily help anybody with their problems and I don't necessarily want to
[23391.53s -> 23405.86s]  I'm gonna be you know, let's get the honesty out here because I don't know I get questions a lot about hey
[23405.86s -> 23410.12s]  What about this? What about that? What about this? And I don't really know it's I don't really have good answers
[23410.12s -> 23413.50s]  A lot of the time I don't want to put people in the wrong path
[23414.14s -> 23416.30s]  Or tell people something that might not even be true
[23416.82s -> 23423.02s]  Because if you put a lot of weight in the things that I say I don't want to be like well
[23423.02s -> 23426.06s]  This is how you do it. This is how would I do because I've you know in the past
[23426.34s -> 23429.06s]  I've tried to give some decent advice as best as I could
[23429.70s -> 23431.87s]  But my advice is not really that good
[23432.19s -> 23437.92s]  It's not adequate. I don't think or what some of you guys might necessarily need
[23438.48s -> 23444.54s]  Remember should I change the dosage of my medication? I'll call your doctor
[23449.46s -> 23451.46s]  You should call to your doctor
[23454.46s -> 23456.98s]  So I'm nothing of a psychologist myself
[23460.93s -> 23467.10s]  Don't tell me what to do, but I
[23468.50s -> 23471.66s]  Obviously everybody in this community that's been a part of this community
[23471.66s -> 23475.06s]  If you just even if you watch for 10 minutes, I wish you the best of health
[23475.06s -> 23479.75s]  I do and I hope you take the steps necessary to get there
[23480.09s -> 23484.25s]  But just be careful putting a lot of weight in
[23485.17s -> 23487.17s]  Somebody like an online entertainer
[23487.17s -> 23492.03s]  Because I might say something that might not even be good enough. It might not be real
[23492.03s -> 23498.09s]  It might be something that's not the best advice to give somebody and if you take that completely and you
[23498.17s -> 23499.69s]  Absorb all of it
[23499.69s -> 23507.06s]  It's maybe something that would should never should have been said in the first place. You know, I mean, did you eat ass? Yes
[23507.58s -> 23516.86s]  Irma is not an expert at anything even streaming, right?
[23520.34s -> 23524.12s]  Enjoy your parasites what from eating ass
[23526.74s -> 23530.54s]  Shit wait, did I say to do that? I did did I? Oh
[23534.82s -> 23541.99s]  No, don't do that don't do that. Oh my god, that person's disgusting, but they could be real is that real?
[23542.39s -> 23548.59s]  All right. I've never I've never eaten ass again. I never did. Why would you who does that? Somebody does it's gross
[23548.59s -> 23554.31s]  I do who does nobody does disgusting move on. Nobody's I don't do that. I really don't I swear to God 100%
[23554.31s -> 23558.27s]  No jokes. Don't do that. Hey creepy teeth. Thanks for the $5
[23558.79s -> 23562.97s]  Irma have you ever thought about playing the Batman games? I feel like it'd be a fun stream
[23562.97s -> 23568.21s]  I'm not sure anything can ever top I can't play Batman games because I played the ultimate Batman game where you could ghost ride
[23568.29s -> 23570.29s]  the Batmobile into a wall
[23570.57s -> 23573.41s]  I'm not sure I could ever top that any of the Batman game could do it
[23583.16s -> 23585.04s]  Let's get the credits on here
[23585.04s -> 23593.18s]  Why not? Right? It was a shitload of subs. You'll see a shitload of names
[23593.56s -> 23596.88s]  They're gonna fly by very fast because there was a lot of people that was subbed today
[23597.68s -> 23604.98s]  It is the lots of community subs and lots of just resubs and new subs. It's a lot of people
[23605.50s -> 23608.50s]  Good morning. I just read that person's name first time ever
[23609.38s -> 23617.74s]  Thanks guys. Seriously. It's a slow lightning around. We're almost done. It's been like 30 minutes
[23617.82s -> 23619.82s]  That's a quick. Okay 30 minutes
[23621.04s -> 23624.36s]  Usually I said it for like 40 to an hour and the 40 to an hour
[23625.16s -> 23628.46s]  Hey goiki. Thanks for the $5 to give credit where credit is due
[23628.46s -> 23632.66s]  This game is pretty faithful to the movie just like the saw puzzles in the movie. This game is stupid and tedious
[23633.30s -> 23642.54s]  Hey Tom sup. Thanks for the $5 streamer man a little over eight years ago
[23642.54s -> 23647.12s]  I was finishing middle school and I found your channel looking for tips for playing Scout glad you took them now
[23647.12s -> 23653.48s]  I'm graduating college. I'm watching ever since I still suck at Scout your work in the community around it mean a lot
[23653.68s -> 23660.04s]  It's been one of my few constants this whole time looking forward to the easy-bake stream more than my virtual graduation that morning
[23660.24s -> 23664.20s]  If you are enjoying what you do because we sure do I am
[23664.96s -> 23668.20s]  I'm gonna continue to do so as long as it's still fun
[23668.20s -> 23672.60s]  I don't have a time frame on when I I'm gonna stop doing it this ever
[23673.12s -> 23679.69s]  Because when it's not fun anymore, that's when I'm done. That's the only fucking thing I care about if it's not fun
[23679.69s -> 23683.24s]  I'm done. You'll know you'll know when I'm you'll know
[23683.64s -> 23685.64s]  When it's time for me to retire
[23686.08s -> 23690.67s]  Because it's I you'll know that I'm just I want to take a step back. It's not really that fun for me anymore
[23691.39s -> 23696.27s]  Based honest now. What do you say?
[23696.87s -> 23700.95s]  Hedonist he didn't what is that? What does that word mean? I think I should know what this means. He didn't
[23701.59s -> 23705.16s]  Person who believes that the pursuit of pleasure is the most important thing in life
[23706.04s -> 23714.78s]  I mean, I just don't want to like pretend on stream. I don't want to like fake. Well, I'm having a good time. I
[23715.64s -> 23720.88s]  Can't do that shit you think I could sit here for more than six to eight hours and like pretend to have a good time
[23720.88s -> 23722.88s]  No, I in ten minutes. I'd be like I'd be gone
[23723.52s -> 23729.56s]  No way you pretend to be bad at games. Yeah
[23730.40s -> 23733.88s]  He's exhausted. He's it's a geez. Oh, it's exhausting
[23734.88s -> 23741.66s]  If I'm not having a good time on streams
[23743.10s -> 23751.06s]  Consistently and I'm getting I don't know. I don't have a plan. I just I didn't have a plan eight years ago
[23751.10s -> 23755.26s]  I didn't have a plan ten years ago. I didn't have a plan twenty years ago for well like any of this shit
[23755.46s -> 23761.88s]  I'm just still here doing it and that's the way it is and it seems to have worked out. All right
[23762.60s -> 23772.65s]  We'll see and it's shocking to me that people have been here for ten years. He's the just like the Roman Empire
[23772.69s -> 23775.15s]  Yeah, that's the Roman Empire crumbled, right?
[23775.81s -> 23781.76s]  What happened to the Roman Empire? Okay, you want to be I'm a hedonist from the Roman Empire. What happened to the Roman Empire?
[23782.28s -> 23788.67s]  But how's my story end? I stopped having fun. Oh
[23789.43s -> 23804.44s]  The Romans are extinct. It was a volcano in barbarians barbarians attacked. Oh
[23806.91s -> 23814.08s]  You're not the Roman Empire
[23814.52s -> 23820.42s]  Another channel is going to raid us to death. Oh
[23822.73s -> 23826.36s]  well
[23826.36s -> 23830.64s]  Eco mania. All right. All right, we're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done
[23831.08s -> 23834.31s]  Hey Wembley TTV. Thanks for the 250
[23834.31s -> 23841.49s]  This game is pretty much a mobile game with all these puzzles and lackluster combat just add in lives and pointless non-skipping phone adverts
[23842.21s -> 23847.21s]  The most ironic thing about all this Konami got the rights for the series to publish this
[23847.73s -> 23854.21s]  So, you know, they did a good job looking after the horror titles after the 2010 looking at you Silent Hill series
[23854.33s -> 23858.29s]  That's been turned into a Chinko machine and it's dead since PT
[23858.85s -> 23865.48s]  No, Konami makes more money from one person sitting at one of their slot machines than a hundred people buying games
[23866.00s -> 23868.44s]  They figured that out a long time ago
[23870.04s -> 23876.55s]  Fortunate hey River Roria. Thanks for the 250. Hey, mr. 900 800 500. The stream was good
[23876.83s -> 23880.99s]  Thanks for the comedy and the humor and the jokes Hickman 2 is one of my favorite games
[23880.99s -> 23883.21s]  I'm so excited for that stream. Also, by the way
[23884.27s -> 23891.50s]  Here is something here
[23891.82s -> 23901.04s]  All right, that's the sound effect. I think that's that's how they're made their exit. Hey rip Alex Trebek
[23901.04s -> 23903.72s]  Thanks for the $5. Hey, Jeremy, if I consider getting a standing desk
[23903.72s -> 23908.92s]  I know standing can be a bit of a meme, but it helps for stretching and not sitting all day, which does suck
[23909.44s -> 23916.82s]  Xoxoxo stinky poopoo epic read it. Okay, nice ending. I'm glad you gave me the TLDR here at the end
[23918.18s -> 23922.76s]  Well, I don't have a standing desk because I just got
[23923.52s -> 23925.84s]  last year a brand new desk
[23926.64s -> 23928.64s]  very nice and I
[23929.04s -> 23934.72s]  It would be a shame to have to spend the money that I did on this nice desk and then replace it with another
[23934.88s -> 23936.52s]  expensive desk
[23936.52s -> 23943.96s]  But what I could do is I could get one of those
[23944.44s -> 23946.44s]  but standing I I
[23946.52s -> 23950.04s]  Don't really like standing and doing stuff. I it doesn't I
[23950.68s -> 23954.96s]  Move around too much. I fidget all the time and I would be gone for a second. I come back
[23954.96s -> 23957.48s]  I'd be I don't really like standing up to standing still
[23958.28s -> 23961.03s]  What I does it doesn't really work for me
[23961.35s -> 23963.78s]  But your health I know
[23964.06s -> 23973.77s]  I'm getting this figured out. Don't worry. I'm figuring it. I'll get it. I'm gonna get it figured out. Don't worry
[23974.29s -> 23979.86s]  Thanks to $5. Hey on zeroic. Thanks with 300 bits
