[1.40s -> 23.03s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. How's it going? The title is wrong? Yeah, it's bad, isn't it?
[23.03s -> 33.88s]  Autocorrect and spell check have ruined society. Hold on, I'm about to burp. This is, you hear this?
[33.88s -> 41.29s]  This is like I'm about to burp voice. I'm holding on to it for a minute. That sounds like I'm about
[41.29s -> 51.37s]  to cry. Autocorrect and spell check have ruined society. Let me tell you why. Honestly, I just
[51.37s -> 55.29s]  typed shit and if it's going to be completely wrong, I don't even care. The computer is going
[55.29s -> 63.78s]  to tell me what I need to fix. I just didn't right click it and fix it. I don't care, leave it.
[68.95s -> 72.87s]  This looks like I was shit faced. Oh yeah, let's do some science experiments, I guess.
[73.59s -> 87.37s]  Tweet that out. All right. Hello. Hi. I haven't seen you in four days or so. I haven't seen you
[87.37s -> 97.85s]  in a while. Chat immediately forgives him after chanting kill for five minutes straight.
[98.65s -> 105.50s]  You guys, what would you guys do with chanting kill? What's wrong with you guys? You guys need
[105.50s -> 115.62s]  to relax. Kill? I mean, I could understand be incredibly upset with, you know, why didn't you
[115.62s -> 120.10s]  write, we're upset with you. We're upset with you. We're okay from now on, right? We're upset with
[120.10s -> 138.49s]  you. Not kill. Welcome to a little late night stream. Be just hanging out late night. There
[138.49s -> 147.03s]  was an announcement from a game that I like, which we'll be checking that out this coming week here,
[147.03s -> 156.49s]  I think on Thursday. Gizmo is in multiverses. He's coming to multiverses. This is literally
[156.49s -> 163.62s]  one of my favorite movie franchises ever made. I am going to main Gizmo. I don't care how bad
[163.62s -> 171.83s]  the character is with me. I don't care how bad I am with it. Gizmo from Gremlins is in multiverses.
[171.83s -> 180.34s]  It's coming this week. Yeah, everybody's like, oh, yeah, I can't wait for Rick. Dude, I can't
[180.34s -> 188.34s]  wait. Oh, man. Oh, Walter White, maybe. Gizmo got in before all of your favorite characters.
[188.34s -> 204.04s]  My favorite character got in and none of you even know who it is. No, I'm very, I'm curious.
[209.59s -> 214.71s]  By the way, yeah, this game has mostly negative reviews on Steam. I don't, I don't, I just,
[215.67s -> 219.03s]  we were in pre-stream and I was like, you know what, fine, I'll put it, how about Mythbusters?
[220.58s -> 225.45s]  This is a mostly negative game. Is it going to be, is it that bad? I don't think so. Wait,
[225.45s -> 242.74s]  let's check it out. Mostly negative. The other options were worse. Excuse me.
[246.92s -> 262.82s]  Cult of the Lamb and 20 minutes till dawn. Excuse me. I'm very curious. Let's try it.
[262.90s -> 266.50s]  What if this is amazing? What if you guys, okay, what if this is really fun?
[267.14s -> 281.78s]  I'm ready. I'm ready to do some experiments. A bad review game usually is a good game for you.
[283.77s -> 304.22s]  For you. All right. Let's go. I'm ready to play. I think I have it set to go. Bane. Yep. Oh,
[304.22s -> 311.35s]  hold on a second. Wait. No, I'm not going to say it. There's a ton of new people in the community
[311.35s -> 315.96s]  over the last year or so. Should we get a new opinion on the Bane voice? I feel like there's
[315.96s -> 324.60s]  a lot of new people here over the last 24 months. I feel like it's going to be,
[325.88s -> 329.16s]  I think people are going to like it. I think people will think it's good. There's so much
[329.16s -> 336.39s]  more people here. There's so much more of a sample. All right. Let's go. Here it is. And
[337.35s -> 344.92s]  snap my fingers. Snap. There I am too. I wasn't naked in that frame, but whatever. I don't care.
[344.92s -> 359.67s]  All right. Let's go. Mythbusters crazy experiments simulator. Are we all here? Should I go? Oh,
[359.67s -> 369.40s]  you need to hear the music. All right. Let's go. So what do you do? We pick an X. Whoa,
[369.40s -> 377.64s]  this is crashing my computer. Hold on. Welcome to Mythbusters the game. Soon you'll be able to play
[377.64s -> 382.12s]  the role of a real Mythbuster. Each myth will have its own unique gameplay mechanics, which
[382.12s -> 387.00s]  you will encounter during the finalization and testing of the experiment. Have fun. Let's go.
[387.64s -> 422.02s]  This is okay. Hold on. It's 1.0. God damn it. I can't make it lower than this. I got to go
[422.02s -> 432.10s]  into my actual mouse DPI. Is it mouse settings? Right? Mouse settings. Cursor speed. Let's put it
[432.10s -> 450.54s]  at, I don't know, like here. Myth busted. Yeah. Okay. Let me see if that helps. All right. I don't
[450.54s -> 466.04s]  know what to do. I just turned my mouse sensitivity at a hardware level down. Can I? How do I fix this?
[466.04s -> 481.37s]  How do I fix this? Lower your DPI? Isn't that what I just did? Hold on. Is this DPI? Hold on.
[481.37s -> 488.46s]  Hardware. Wheel pointer options. Pointer speed. How do I turn the DPI down on my fucking mouse?
[488.46s -> 504.95s]  Cursor speed is not DPI. Well, where's DPI? It's not in Windows. Where is it? Wait, it's not Windows
[504.95s -> 514.86s]  mouse speed? Whatever. Okay. I'll deal with it. Can I use the controller? Okay. Go to the myth board
[514.86s -> 523.69s]  in order to choose a myth. Not a whole lot going on here. That's like we, we got one. It's our,
[523.69s -> 535.75s]  put it on, stick it on the wall. We're about to make our first $40. Okay. Heroes Gambit.
[535.75s -> 539.51s]  Action movie heroes tend to find ways to survive a grenade blast within seconds.
[540.07s -> 543.11s]  Is it possible to survive a grenade explosion by covering it with an object
[543.11s -> 548.79s]  and hiding behind a suitable cover? Bucket? A barrel? Or maybe a wooden box? What would be
[548.79s -> 557.88s]  the best way to stop the explosion? Why are we jumping on grenades? Oh, plug with the Mythbusters,
[557.88s -> 564.20s]  man. First myth of the day. Gary's going to jump on a grenade and fucking explode. And we'll see
[564.20s -> 575.42s]  how many, what's the point of this? It's going to be one episode of this show. Um, okay. Uh, okay.
[575.98s -> 579.82s]  Unlock experience. Run for your life. Test the firepower of a grenade. Save the mock-up from...
[580.74s -> 587.72s]  Okay. So I accept it. Now you're going to pick the first myth for testing. The goal of the game is
[587.72s -> 594.01s]  to get as popular as possible while still having enough budget for your experiments. During the
[594.01s -> 599.99s]  game, you will get cards to assemble episodes. Wait, we have to actually make the show?
[601.50s -> 606.06s]  Appropriate usage of those cards in the episode will allow you to gain higher popularity and budget.
[606.06s -> 615.69s]  All right. All right. Let's go. Here's my, here's my team. Okay. This is celebrities can make the
[615.69s -> 622.44s]  audience stick around. His knowledge will be an immense help during your endeavors. And he has
[622.44s -> 630.68s]  been working with guns and explosives for years. Well, I mean, it's going to be this guy. You bring
[630.68s -> 642.28s]  the explosives expert. You don't, I mean, yeah, that's correct. Right. Let's go. So how do we do
[642.28s -> 653.58s]  the experiment? How to survive a grenade. It's called pick it up off the ground and throw it back.
[655.03s -> 669.30s]  Let's see. How's that? Okay. Test the firepower of a grenade. What's going on? Wait, hold on. My
[669.30s -> 676.97s]  brain is confused. Where are we? Test the firepower of a grenade. Save the mock-up from,
[677.93s -> 697.51s]  All right. Click and drag to throw the ball. There's drop it on my leg. What happened?
[697.51s -> 720.09s]  This is a long cook time on this grenade. Did I do it? It was a grenade. Determine the area
[720.09s -> 729.40s]  percentage. Click within a body to fill it. What? What happened? Wait, what? I don't understand
[729.40s -> 737.61s]  what's happening. Click within a body to fill it. Select apply button. How, it has to be at 5%.
[742.90s -> 764.39s]  I'm so confused. What's happening? The right side. What does it want me to do? Are you sure? I don't
[764.39s -> 774.79s]  know what it's asking. Read the number on the right. Fill 36%. I mean, this is like 36.
[775.91s -> 782.84s]  Okay. Oh, all right. I get it. I get it. Okay. Wait. Oh, we're making the grenade. I get it. All
[782.84s -> 787.75s]  right. Oh, this is easy. I get it. Oh my God. I just, I don't like this. Okay. We need to move.
[787.75s -> 791.99s]  Oh my, what? I thought I was going to be playing with, I thought I was going to be playing,
[791.99s -> 804.73s]  whatever. You know what I'm trying to say. Move the tiles. I have 44 moves left. Oh Jesus Christ.
[804.73s -> 816.46s]  Okay. Hold on. I just have to do it, right? That's it. I don't have to do anything fancy.
[817.93s -> 825.06s]  All right. Let's go. Solve the equation by moving the specified number of sticks.
[831.94s -> 838.79s]  I don't think they did this on the show. Okay. Seven times three equals nine plus I can move
[838.79s -> 845.91s]  two sticks. This is just those, the book of bathroom brain teasers that I used to have.
[847.45s -> 861.00s]  What's the answer? I don't even care. One times three, one times three equals seven times three
[862.38s -> 877.62s]  equals nine, 10 to the 12, 13, 14, 15. That's not, that's not 21. 78. What is it? Seven times two.
[877.62s -> 891.94s]  All right. Seven times two. How do I do that? No. All right. We made the grenade. All right. I made
[891.94s -> 906.22s]  the grenade. I got it. Okay. Time to do it. Run for, prepare the grenade and build a test mockup.
[906.22s -> 909.34s]  When you are ready, place everything on the testing grounds. The test mockup does not get
[909.34s -> 927.80s]  destroyed. Okay. Additional objectives. All right. Okay. Page number, shooting range. Oh, okay. Throw
[927.80s -> 933.46s]  the grenade. Yeah. Whatever. Whatever. I don't fucking care. Let's go. Let's go to the, let's
[933.46s -> 945.21s]  go to the fun part where I can experiment. All right. Assembly mode. Look, I just want to be the
[945.21s -> 949.37s]  fucking celebrity that walks on and just has the safety goggles and is like,
[951.05s -> 955.21s]  that's all my lines. I don't do anything. I have my own air conditioned trailer.
[955.77s -> 977.99s]  What are the two songs playing? $150 for a hammer. What? I have to build the grenade?
[980.92s -> 994.04s]  No, we just buy the grenade. I don't want to build a grenade. Okay. I need nails. One nail. I need
[994.12s -> 1008.30s]  six planks. Oh my God. This looks like I don't want to even be in this room. I need a wood saw.
[1011.37s -> 1018.44s]  Where's my actual money? My popularity is a thousand. Okay. Buy a grenade. Buy this thing.
[1019.08s -> 1026.63s]  I need six wooden planks. How many do these do I need? How many nails?
[1027.74s -> 1042.82s]  Seven nails. How many do I have? Okay. What is this? Why would I buy saws? Spending all my money.
[1045.06s -> 1048.82s]  By the way, isn't this my workshop? Why would I need to buy things in my own workshop?
[1049.46s -> 1057.03s]  All right. Wooden plank. I need six. They don't show this process on TV.
[1059.40s -> 1075.00s]  All right. Check your notebooks on page three. Okay. Oh, okay. Let's build it. Well,
[1075.00s -> 1092.92s]  this is where the music is coming from. Craft. A piezoelectric grenade. Remove the grenade fuse.
[1093.72s -> 1105.48s]  I want to remove the grenade fuse. Okay. Mount a grenade to mount a grenade.
[1106.28s -> 1121.21s]  How you so fused by holding down? I would not want to be in this room. Okay. Okay. This is my
[1121.21s -> 1128.66s]  grenade. This is my Molotov grenade. All right. So now what do I do with this? Move wrench to the
[1128.66s -> 1148.65s]  tool belt. Where's the wrench? Oh, okay. And hammer on the tool belt too, right? Is this a detonator?
[1149.62s -> 1167.37s]  All right. Let's go. I got that. Close backpack. Tab. Choose wrench. You bet your ass I'm trying
[1167.37s -> 1176.42s]  to throw it. I can't throw it. All right. What do I do now? No, no, I don't want another one.
[1178.58s -> 1205.48s]  So check your notebook page four. Assemble the saw. Page four. Please refer to page five.
[1206.28s -> 1212.86s]  Okay. Assemble the saw. I think that I just have to get this stuff ready, right? Prepare the saw for
[1212.86s -> 1228.38s]  cutting. All right. Let's go. Wrong tool. I need a wrench. Okay. Ooh. Satisfying sound effects.
[1228.94s -> 1242.41s]  Okay. The machine's ready to work. So what do I do now?
[1245.56s -> 1250.84s]  Don't lie down. Don't like put your neck under here. All right. I'm ready to work.
[1252.28s -> 1263.48s]  That's not good. Get me out of this. Okay. Cool. So it's assembled, right? We're good. Using the saw,
[1263.48s -> 1281.61s]  get wooden beam piece. Okay. How do I use it? What the fuck was that? Oh, okay. I get it.
[1284.47s -> 1298.44s]  Wooden plank piece. You don't want to be going fast in this environment. There should be points
[1298.44s -> 1315.32s]  for speed. Okay. So I got everything. Check your notebook. What's wrong with my drugs? What's wrong
[1315.32s -> 1332.47s]  with my face? All right. Now what? What page am I on? All right. So I need a hammer.
[1333.11s -> 1342.17s]  Okay. I need a hammer. I got a hammer. Hammer. Go to the big workshop and make a mock-up.
[1344.97s -> 1363.02s]  Oh, all right. Here we go. Test mock-up. I don't want to. I just, I'll be honest,
[1363.02s -> 1368.57s]  I just didn't want to read any of that. I didn't want to read any of it. Any of it. I didn't read
[1368.57s -> 1392.07s]  a sentence. It's good, right? Okay. It's in. Now we, what the fuck am I making? What is this?
[1394.44s -> 1412.36s]  I'm making a shitty mailbox for like my second grade class. What is this supposed to be? Um,
[1413.64s -> 1453.21s]  middle with bonnet, middle with cowboy hat. Oh, you bet your ass. If I was on this episode,
[1453.21s -> 1456.89s]  I would be like, yeah, let me do it. I'd be like hitting it with the hammer and I would hit it hard
[1456.89s -> 1471.35s]  and put, pretend my thumb got hit and go like, oh, and put it like into my mouth and shit. What
[1471.35s -> 1486.87s]  am I doing? Why? What am I doing with this? Okay. Put it on the truck. Okay. Head to the shooting
[1486.87s -> 1518.04s]  range. How? Oh, okay. Shooting range. Okay. The cleanup crew is coming. So what? Check your
[1518.04s -> 1532.17s]  notebook on page six. Start the myth and activate explosives. Use to reduce the radius of the
[1532.17s -> 1538.39s]  explosion with shields. Used to reduce the radius of the explosion and space for all large tests.
[1538.39s -> 1548.46s]  What do you, what do you want? Lethal zone. Okay. Here you will start the experiment and start the
[1548.46s -> 1552.94s]  test sequence. You will need to have an appropriate tool in order to start. I need a button. Okay.
[1553.66s -> 1576.71s]  Take the test mock up to the say, all right, let's go. Where is it? It's on the truck. Okay.
[1576.71s -> 1579.59s]  We didn't really need to bring the whole truck for this. I got to put this in the back of
[1579.67s -> 1588.23s]  somebody's car. We didn't need to bring the truck for one item. Where is it? Where's my cardboard
[1588.23s -> 1595.27s]  cutout? Take the test mock up to the safe zone. Where is it? I loaded it in the truck. What
[1595.27s -> 1618.49s]  happened? It escaped. What? Dude, you're the test. Is it in my inventory? No. Where is it?
[1628.73s -> 1664.58s]  What happened? It's behind the truck. What? No, it's not. Where is it? Hey, where is it?
[1665.24s -> 1674.89s]  Uh, is it, is it not there? Did I, is it, am I soft-locked? I have to make a new one, loser.
[1675.45s -> 1690.82s]  Go to the shooting range. It was on the stand there. Was it? Well, I told me,
[1690.82s -> 1702.07s]  I didn't have to take it out of the truck. Who do you think drove you there?
[1702.87s -> 1715.72s]  That's funny. Where is he? Where is this thing? Where is this guy? I'm serious. Where is he?
[1716.28s -> 1727.54s]  The grenade's still on the shop's table. No, it's not. I have it in my inventory.
[1727.78s -> 1742.98s]  That guy didn't want to die. Where is he? Look behind you on a stand. It's not here.
[1745.34s -> 1760.57s]  No, behind you. Check the box, maybe. I think I have, I think it's fucked up. I think it's
[1760.57s -> 1777.45s]  screwed up. I think I have to restart it. Large menu items. It's in the house. It's where the
[1777.45s -> 1790.02s]  arrow is pointing. Yeah, there's nothing there. I can't do anything about it. Yeah, take the
[1790.02s -> 1815.37s]  test mock-up to the safe zone, which is here. Walks in front of the truck. Shit! Wait, what's
[1815.37s -> 1836.84s]  this? What's this? No. Wait, was it really? It was not there. I think it's gone. I just think it's
[1836.84s -> 1848.82s]  gone. Okay. I don't know what, I don't even know what items those were. Did I actually lose it?
[1862.65s -> 1876.71s]  Fuck. I actually think it's screwed up. Oh, that's not good. What do I do? Should I start over?
[1876.71s -> 1884.07s]  I don't think I want to start. Should I start over, man? I feel like all you guys are going to
[1884.07s -> 1903.93s]  leave. Who raided? Is it Raid? I don't even see who, I can't see who raided. Who didn't rejoin?
[1903.93s -> 1912.90s]  Wait, who? Slime? Slimesicle Raid, what's up? Hey, we just started the stream. Thanks a lot.
[1912.90s -> 1917.22s]  Slimesicle, appreciate it. Welcome everybody from Slimesicle's stream. We're just getting started
[1917.22s -> 1924.20s]  here. Gonna be busting some myths. Just turned the stream on for the first time. You joined at the
[1924.20s -> 1934.31s]  perfect opportunity. Time to bust some myths. What do we got today for our first one? Run for
[1934.31s -> 1957.26s]  your life? What, I have to make a grenade? This is fucking different than last time. What? What?
[1957.82s -> 2006.89s]  Did I win? Skip it. Skip. I don't care. Why can't I move this one? Fuck. Just skip it.
[2006.89s -> 2036.66s]  Fail it over and over again. Look, I'm too stupid. See? All right, we got the grenade. We're good.
[2036.66s -> 2064.87s]  Okay, cool. Yep. Well, got it. All right, let's go get the items. How many nails? Seven? One?
[2064.87s -> 2086.82s]  Wasn't it seven? It was seven nails last time. I'm so confused. What's wrong with my guy? This
[2086.82s -> 2111.18s]  fucking music is fucked. How many do I? Wooden, three wooden planks. I need the start button.
[2111.18s -> 2161.19s]  Okay, cool. Yep, I got it. I won't laugh. You laugh, you lose. If I laugh, I have to turn the
[2161.19s -> 2182.36s]  stream off. Why turn the music down? This doesn't count. This doesn't count. The music is at fucking
[2182.36s -> 2192.87s]  zero percent. Okay, it was the radio. No, starting now. That doesn't count. Starting now. Starting
[2192.87s -> 2280.25s]  now. If I laugh, I'll turn the stream off. Where's the sound? Why is there no sound? This is going
[2280.25s -> 2319.21s]  to get DMCA. Whatever. I don't really care. We're just doing just generic. Just generic. I'm not
[2319.21s -> 2351.37s]  adding anything weird. Just right side, left. Just generic. Okay, take item. I'm holding it in my
[2351.37s -> 2363.91s]  hands right now. Into the truck. Bring it to the truck. Okay, I'm in the truck. Drop in the truck.
[2363.91s -> 2373.51s]  That didn't do that last time. I don't know what it did last time, but not that. I'm ready. I'm
[2373.51s -> 2474.57s]  running to the beat. Let's go. There we go. Yes. What? Hey, hey, hey. What do I do? I don't know
[2474.57s -> 2530.95s]  what to do. What's the point of this guy? What's the point of this guy? Leave it on the board?
[2530.95s -> 2562.58s]  Put the Tessa objects in the appropriate slots and protect them from the explosion. I can't
[2562.58s -> 2624.74s]  fucking take it anymore. It's been six minutes. I've turned it off. Wow. Whoa. Wait, I can edit
[2624.74s -> 2652.28s]  the episode? Okay, go to your laptop. There's shit everywhere. Okay, I can edit the video.
[2652.28s -> 2660.18s]  That scared me. I didn't know what that was. That was actually terrifying. Okay,
[2660.18s -> 2670.22s]  find nice messages from fans. Okay. Progress and then the Mythmaker Studio. All right, let's go
[2670.22s -> 2675.62s]  for it. Each episode has five empty slots that can be filled with collected cards. All right,
[2675.62s -> 2685.42s]  we had Sergeant. We said Sergeant Daniel is there. Each episode is 45 minutes. Wait,
[2685.42s -> 2697.03s]  we're going to spend 20 minutes targeting Sergeant Daniel? Sounds pretty good to me.
[2712.74s -> 2717.54s]  Good afternoon. We have a great idea for an experiment. Consider this. Can a chair with
[2717.54s -> 2724.49s]  enough balloons fly? I hope we understand each other. Waiting for some good material. That means
[2724.49s -> 2732.52s]  they don't like the show. Your show is really nice. I like it very much. I like it. Good show. Good
[2732.52s -> 2744.52s]  luck in your future endeavors. Hey, thanks. Thanks, Michael Brown. Cool. All right. Do I sleep in
[2744.52s -> 2760.22s]  this? Go to the myth board. All right. Where's the myth board? Oh, right here. Of course. Balloon
[2760.22s -> 2771.24s]  chair. All right. I'm doing balloon chair and then I'm never playing this game again. Yeah,
[2771.24s -> 2790.90s]  sure. I don't want to make a go. I don't want to make a grenade for the balloon chair. I don't.
[2790.90s -> 2813.37s]  I don't. What do you want me to do? Oh, I got it. All right. Cool. Sick. This game's sick.
[2813.37s -> 2863.08s]  How many degrees does a right angle have? 90. All right, we got it. Okay. Time to go and check my
[2863.08s -> 2877.56s]  notebook. This game's cute. This game's cute. Come on. This is cute. Okay. Pork. Wait, why am I
[2877.56s -> 2890.49s]  getting pork for? Is the Mythbuster to make like a pork chop sandwich for somebody? How many bottles?
[2890.49s -> 2900.42s]  He loathes it. I didn't say that. How many more bottles of water do I need? Water times one. Water
[2900.42s -> 2904.90s]  times one. How many waters do? Oh, this is a bottle. Never mind. I thought it was blue. I thought
[2904.90s -> 2918.89s]  they were water bottles. Whatever. Where's the? Oh, okay. Cool. Let's assemble it. This is my
[2918.89s -> 2971.45s]  favorite part. Go to the pump station. Gelatin in the bucket? No, not cement. What do I do?
[2971.45s -> 2982.14s]  Press the valve? Press and hold the valve. I like the way this sounds. How do I do it?
[2982.14s -> 2994.26s]  Where's the press and hold the valve? Check the ballistic gel proportions. What does that mean?
[2994.26s -> 3011.18s]  I need 10 to 20 percent pork gelatin and 80 to 90 percent water. Oh, shit. Hold on. Whoa! That's way
[3011.18s -> 3023.61s]  too much. Oops. Everybody all right? Everybody move. Nobody's got glass in them or anything?
[3023.61s -> 3030.42s]  No, I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do.
[3030.50s -> 3054.50s]  Hold on. Let's go. 20 percent. Oh, come on. 20 percent. And then 80 percent water. Like that,
[3054.50s -> 3090.42s]  right? We good? Oh, dude. Fucking science. Ballistic gel hand? Oh, dude. Science! Do we have a
[3090.42s -> 3098.73s]  ballistic gel hand? Dude, that's only possible with freaking science. Make a second hand? Well,
[3098.73s -> 3115.74s]  why did you tell me to make? Science actually is pretty cool. It is. It's fun. Look, I will take
[3115.74s -> 3122.94s]  science over math. I will take science over social studies. I will take science over English
[3122.94s -> 3143.82s]  class every single time. No matter what. Every time. Make a second hand? Oh, that's wrong. What
[3143.82s -> 3160.57s]  about geography? No, I would have liked school a lot more if it was 40 percent science class. Like,
[3160.57s -> 3173.83s]  20 percent gym. And then 40 percent. All right. 30 percent science. 20 percent gym. 20 percent
[3173.83s -> 3191.34s]  lunch. And then like 30 percent like who invented stuff. That would be cool to me. Like,
[3191.34s -> 3195.34s]  inventor is 101. Like, oh, we learn about like every invention that ever was invented and who
[3195.34s -> 3204.01s]  made it and what their patents are and shit. Kind of fucking cool, don't you think? Oh, and what
[3204.01s -> 3210.10s]  credit score is and how to write a check and what like taxes are. Would have been kind of nice if
[3210.10s -> 3225.26s]  they told us that. You know, just saying. All right. Let's open the notebook. All right. So,
[3225.26s -> 3233.72s]  here we go. It's time to do this. I need the wrench. We're going to put the things together.
[3234.28s -> 3246.22s]  I'm not this cute. OK, item checklist. Let's go. I'm ready. You're 40. You should know by now.
[3246.22s -> 3251.45s]  I do now. And I have for the last probably five to 10 years. I did not know this until I was
[3251.45s -> 3256.14s]  probably in my early to mid 20s. It took way too long. It shouldn't have. I should. It shouldn't
[3256.14s -> 3268.44s]  have waited until I was like 25 to understand all this stuff. Like 23, 24, 25, 26. I knew what it
[3268.44s -> 3273.54s]  was, but I didn't understand how it worked. And you know what? Sometimes I still kind of don't
[3273.54s -> 3280.52s]  understand how the fuck that works because it's different everywhere. All right. I need the parts.
[3280.92s -> 3292.74s]  The craft. The buster. Collect all the needed. Aren't they all here?
[3292.74s -> 3296.98s]  Teenagers don't know to know credit scores. No, but teenagers that grow into adults need to know
[3296.98s -> 3302.25s]  what a credit score is. And teenagers that grow into adults need to know about like financial
[3302.25s -> 3313.62s]  literacy and all the things that come with it. I don't know why we wait so long. OK, cool.
[3316.04s -> 3327.19s]  Where do I get this stuff? Collect all the needed parts. What is it? I need steel rod 15. Oh,
[3327.19s -> 3336.15s]  they're not going to help me anymore. The tutorial is over. OK, I need 15 steel rods. Where are those?
[3336.15s -> 3349.42s]  Oh, just spend all my money on cement. You got it. I don't know why it feels like a Mr. Beast video.
[3349.42s -> 3370.15s]  I filled this bowl with cement up to my neck. Uh, where is it? Steel rods. Oh, here we go.
[3370.15s -> 3387.93s]  Steel pipe. Steel rod piece. I don't know what any of this means. Steel rod piece. Just buy five of
[3387.93s -> 3392.81s]  them. This is what I would do. I would just buy five of these and just bring it to the contract
[3392.81s -> 3397.70s]  and go. This might be way more, but just keep whatever you keep and use whatever you don't need.
[3397.70s -> 3400.41s]  Like for another project, you don't have to pay me. I don't care. I just want to make sure
[3400.41s -> 3413.18s]  it's right. All right, so 15. Oh, I need more than that. 15. Well, how many did I buy? Five. OK, 13
[3413.18s -> 3417.26s]  screws. Any buster head, buster torso, buster pelvis, buster limb, buster hand, buster foot.
[3417.26s -> 3437.66s]  What is that? All right, 13 screws. OK, where's buster? Buster head? Buster hand? What is that in
[3438.38s -> 3451.06s]  construction terms? What is a buster head, a buster torso, buster arm? What is that? Buster. Wait,
[3451.06s -> 3457.48s]  where is this? Oh, it's the dummy. Where do I find the dummy? It's the name of the dummy. Well,
[3458.28s -> 3476.76s]  OK. Oh, buster. I got to cut up the steel rod. Where's the saw bench? Where's the saw bench?
[3476.76s -> 3483.78s]  I forget where it is. There it is. All right, I need steel rod piece.
[3485.30s -> 3494.90s]  Saw blade damaged? What are you talking about? The wrong material was cut. What? I broke this?
[3494.90s -> 3522.62s]  Oh, it's a wood saw. God damn it. City boy. You know why? OK, I don't know how to change
[3522.62s -> 3528.87s]  a tire either. Very, very important thing to know because I could know and I could learn,
[3528.87s -> 3536.34s]  but I know I would screw it up. I would screw it up. And my fear of knowing that when I put that
[3536.34s -> 3541.08s]  tire on, I'm going to get back on the fucking highway and my car is going to flip over like
[3541.08s -> 3548.78s]  GTA. Somebody that knows what they're doing has to do that, not me. I just have this crazy fear.
[3548.78s -> 3554.63s]  Oh, yeah, man. No, you're fine. Just pop the hood and connect this and then take that out
[3554.63s -> 3559.64s]  and put this back in. My car is going to explode if I do it. I will put everything and I'll follow
[3559.64s -> 3564.36s]  the YouTube tutorial instructions or whatever, and I'll be like, OK, pause the video. Rewind 10
[3564.36s -> 3568.52s]  seconds. Watch it again to make sure I'm doing exactly what that guy just did. Verbatim with his
[3568.52s -> 3574.71s]  hands. OK, done. When I close the lid to the engine, the car is going to explode the second
[3574.71s -> 3584.20s]  that it latches in the front. I can't. I just can't do it. I'm too afraid of it. Change a tire on
[3584.20s -> 3595.98s]  stream. I wouldn't be able to. YouTube University. No, you don't pop the hood to change the tire.
[3595.98s -> 3601.91s]  I'm just saying, like, in general, mechanical stuff like that I'm terrified of. It's not hard
[3601.91s -> 3609.40s]  to change a tire. I know it doesn't matter. So, yeah, you pop the trunk, pop the hood to get to
[3609.40s -> 3617.51s]  the tire. Yeah, I'm telling you, I'm going to have the wrench in my hand. I'm going to be sitting
[3617.51s -> 3624.47s]  there like, all right, pop the tub. Pop the top of it. Yeah. Looks like that screw is loose in there.
[3624.47s -> 3628.39s]  Yeah, kill the engine, mate. Kill the engine. Go, go, go, go, go, go. All right, let me get in there.
[3628.39s -> 3633.35s]  And I'm going to get in there and I'm going to put the wrench around the nut or whatever.
[3633.35s -> 3638.63s]  And I'm going to go and I'm going to wake up in front of the pearly gates. It's going to be like,
[3638.63s -> 3643.67s]  yeah, man, I'm good to go. Yeah, no, this looks good. I think this is correct. I'm awake.
[3644.71s -> 3651.24s]  Something killed me. I just wake up at the pearly gates and fucking Peter's going to be like, wow,
[3651.24s -> 3659.29s]  man, you don't even know how to change a tire. He just fires me down to hell. I look over and I see
[3659.29s -> 3663.13s]  over like the pearly gates, I see like all the mechanics. They're all sitting there and they're
[3663.13s -> 3668.22s]  all like, yeah, waving to me. It's just like a shitload of mechanics and like electricians.
[3668.22s -> 3688.97s]  What do I need? Peter Griffin is dead because bad. Wait, but hold on. It doesn't mean like
[3688.97s -> 3698.98s]  Sekiro on stream means I get to go to heaven. And that's logic. Hold on. Why are we tying?
[3699.70s -> 3705.64s]  Oh, why am I tying like professional skill to you go to heaven? That doesn't make any sense.
[3707.45s -> 3712.41s]  These guys were all car mechanics. If you're not a car mechanic, you go to fucking hell.
[3713.61s -> 3722.39s]  What am I talking about? That doesn't make any sense. This game must be pretty boring for you
[3722.39s -> 3733.21s]  to talk about this. Playing video games with the skill is not worthy of heaven. Hey, all dogs go
[3733.21s -> 3748.84s]  to heaven. Some dogs go to hell. Can you imagine that's the sequel? Oh, Disney presents some dogs
[3748.84s -> 3768.78s]  go to hell. Rated PG. There is a sequel. What? Do I even have this thing? No, I don't. What was
[3768.78s -> 3786.70s]  the name? Was it all dogs go to heaven too? Colon, some dogs go to hell. Where? Okay,
[3786.70s -> 3790.30s]  I need the saw blade. I'm good. I'm good. I'm on it. I'm back on it. I'm back on it.
[3790.30s -> 3806.23s]  Do I have enough screws to put this on? Okay. Let's get back to this, please. He thinks he's
[3806.23s -> 3812.78s]  so funny. No, I think that was funny. I don't think everything I say is funny. I think that
[3812.78s -> 3820.02s]  was genuinely humorous. Typo in the title, hee hee. You know what? Yeah, fuck that. That just sucks.
[3820.02s -> 3828.73s]  We're getting rid of it. I'm changing it to some dogs go to hell. No, that's like weird at a context.
[3828.73s -> 3852.52s]  Um, how about just like, science. Okay. I mean, it's only going to be the title for like another
[3852.52s -> 3859.50s]  15 minutes, if I'm honest. Play something else. Why are you playing this and not gloom wood?
[3859.50s -> 3864.09s]  I don't know. I'll play gloom wood eventually. Is it out? I thought it wasn't out yet.
[3870.15s -> 3885.46s]  Oh, it came out in early access. Okay. There are three all dogs go to heaven movies?
[3886.02s -> 3906.04s]  How many of these do I need? How many? Did I? How many of those do I need? All dogs go to heaven.
[3906.04s -> 3913.98s]  Hold on. Wait, there's three movies? All dogs go to heaven. The series friends to the rescue
[3913.98s -> 3925.40s]  and all dogs Christmas carol. All dogs go to heaven too. What's the main character's name?
[3925.40s -> 3938.84s]  The dog from all dogs go to heaven. Charlie. All dogs go to heaven three. Charlie's inferno.
[3938.84s -> 3965.37s]  Why is there a countdown? Okay. So now I need I have steel rod pieces. I need the
[3965.37s -> 3987.14s]  I gotta hit those put Buster's head together. Buster. Here we go. Press the F, dude, please.
[3987.14s -> 4012.17s]  What? I just did. What do you mean? What's wrong? This feels weird. Something about this just says
[4012.17s -> 4021.32s]  this feels weird, but like somehow wrong. How do I make this? Um, okay. I need to make the head
[4021.32s -> 4028.22s]  with the no. I need to make ballistic goo. Okay. Ballistic gel head. I need. Okay. Ballistic goo.
[4028.22s -> 4038.49s]  How do I need? What is this? Not cement or whatever it is. I don't know how much this. I
[4038.49s -> 4050.90s]  don't know. I'm just gonna get it though. Water tank. I need a few of these. Okay. Um, is it a
[4050.90s -> 4076.71s]  ballistic Buster's torso? But is it ballistic torso? Am I missing that? Oh, there's already
[4076.71s -> 4089.48s]  one here. All right. Um, no bottle to fill. Here we go. Okay. 20%. 90%. Is Buster already made?
[4098.06s -> 4124.68s]  What happened to it? Okay. 20%. That's it, right? 20 and what's going on? How do I get it?
[4124.68s -> 4134.33s]  It's going to blow. Just take it. Unknown substance added to backpack. That how is this
[4134.33s -> 4168.86s]  making any sense? What am I doing wrong? It's 20% and 80% or 10% and 90%. Right? 10% 90%.
[4181.75s -> 4233.82s]  How am I doing this wrong? 20% 80%. I did stop it at a hundred. It didn't do anything. 20%.
[4241.91s -> 4256.89s]  I can't. If I go any more further, it's going to explode. Ballistic gel. Okay. I need poly
[4256.89s -> 4266.58s]  polypropylene granules or ballistic gel. That's what I'm trying to make right now. Ballistic gel.
[4266.58s -> 4279.51s]  I'm trying to make ballistic gel right now. Okay. 10 to 20% gel and 80, 90%. How is this wrong?
[4279.51s -> 4299.18s]  Potion of helium. Is this Harry Potter? A portion of helium. Okay. Ballistic gel is I'm going to do
[4299.18s -> 4316.01s]  15%. That's 15% right there, right in the middle. And I'm going to do 85%. I would help me. What's
[4316.01s -> 4336.18s]  happening? 15% 80, 85%. Science is magic. That's not 85. Yes, it is. Take the bottle now. It doesn't
[4336.18s -> 4363.78s]  know what it. All right. All right. I've, I've, I've had it 15 plus 85 is a hundred. Okay. I'm doing
[4363.86s -> 4374.38s]  10, 10 and 90, 10 and 90%. It has to be correct. Didn't you want all classes to be science?
[4374.38s -> 4382.58s]  I actually don't know what's happening. Neither do I. Imagine how gross it is if you get splashed
[4382.58s -> 4389.75s]  with pork, gelatin and water. Yeah. This keeps hitting me right in the face. Okay. Here we go.
[4390.31s -> 4419.22s]  I'm going to do 10 and 90. Should I do 20? 10 plus 80 is 90. Put the water in first.
[4425.29s -> 4436.17s]  How? What am I doing wrong? Water first. I'm going to do 80%. 80% water. Now gelatin.
[4438.58s -> 4446.95s]  I'm going to get kicked out of this place. 10 and 80. Don't fill the hole away.
[4446.95s -> 4464.12s]  Dude, this is genuinely worse than the clock. How is this worse than the clock? I'm doing what it
[4464.12s -> 4477.38s]  says is I'm supposed to be doing. There's your 10 and 80%. It doesn't work. Look, 15 gelatin
[4477.38s -> 4509.53s]  and then water up to 90. Bro, none of your hypothesis works. 10 plus 70. Hey, I got a
[4509.53s -> 4534.49s]  hypothesis. Flip the recipe. How does that sound? Didn't work. Is that pork? Yeah, it's pork gelatin.
[4534.49s -> 4549.70s]  These jello shots. Yeah, I made jello shots with bone broth and vodka. First one to puke loses.
[4549.70s -> 4554.10s]  Um, does anyone understand what's going on? Cause I think we've tried every combination.
[4554.10s -> 4563.70s]  It's the wrong gelatin. Pork gelatin and water. This is pork gelatin down here.
[4563.70s -> 4586.92s]  Take the bottle off before it explodes. Holy shit. I already did that. Why? Unknown substance.
[4586.92s -> 4606.12s]  Oh my God. How much bullshit is in here? Please tell me he's pretending. Um, all right. I am
[4606.12s -> 4613.06s]  going to hover over gelatin and I want everyone to scream the stop sign when they want me to stop.
[4613.06s -> 4635.51s]  I'm going to do it very slow. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck that. Look at all these people saying this shit.
[4635.51s -> 4646.79s]  I don't get it. Oh my God. I'm screaming. Okay. How about this? This is like 15%.
[4648.42s -> 4666.36s]  80. Like this is correct. That's correct. This is correct. More water. More water. More water. No,
[4666.36s -> 4677.67s]  no, no, no, no. A bit more water. It's not there. The white circle is the gelatin combined. Yeah,
[4677.67s -> 4688.39s]  I know. 80 to 90% water. That is, that is legitimately what we are looking at right now.
[4688.39s -> 4692.39s]  This is legitimately, legitimately what we're looking at. He's definitely not sober. Yes,
[4692.39s -> 4737.88s]  I am. Take it. Why do I have four of these? What didn't it say? Uh, now I got a clay mass.
[4737.88s -> 4747.14s]  I don't wait. So I need to make a bunch of clay. I need clay and water. All right. So I need clay.
[4747.14s -> 4759.42s]  This is a pain in the ass. Is there salami? Can I make salami water? Worst gamer moment. That no,
[4759.42s -> 4764.54s]  it was not. I, that's horse shit. If you say that actual horse shit, don't say that. I,
[4764.54s -> 4776.98s]  I tried it like five different ways. Okay. Here we go. What is it? What's the combination?
[4776.98s -> 4794.20s]  20 to 50% clay, 20 to 50% water. All right. What's going half and half? Here we go again.
[4795.21s -> 4814.42s]  40 and 40. That's perfect. Yeah. That's, that's it. 40, 40 and 40. That's it. It's done. See? See,
[4814.42s -> 4826.79s]  a lot of you guys got that wrong, apparently. Yeah. You apparently got that wrong. Okay. I got
[4826.79s -> 4840.68s]  clay. Now I need helium. Try to just make more. I'm going to make one more. Probably need it.
[4840.68s -> 4845.16s]  All right. Now I need to, let's see if I can put this together. I got to put the
[4845.16s -> 4857.32s]  in here, right? Um, where's the head? This is a torso, right? Okay. Ballistic torso. Uh, okay.
[4857.32s -> 4868.58s]  So, okay. We need ballistic. What else? Ballistic feet? Oh my God. It takes so much of this stupid
[4868.58s -> 4891.69s]  ass gel. I need to make more. I need to make way more then. All right. Throw this away.
[4891.69s -> 4904.04s]  Gel and water is fine. What was it again? 15 and I need more bottles. Why are you wasting so much
[4904.04s -> 4921.10s]  stuff? Um, because it's not real. Oh, balloons. 20 balloons is 630 fucking dollars. And what are
[4921.10s -> 4951.45s]  you talking about? Oh, right. Okay. All right. Let's get it. This is 15%. 80%. That should do it
[4951.45s -> 4975.74s]  right there. I, what, what happened? What happened? 15 and what's going on? 15, 80%. That's 10, 20,
[4975.74s -> 5006.46s]  30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80. Yay. Is that your real, real voice? Yeah. Here we go. Oh, let's do, let's
[5006.46s -> 5013.59s]  just do, I'm gonna just make a ton of them. This is worse than school. No, it, it isn't. No, it is
[5013.59s -> 5026.49s]  not. Oh, also a lot of you would be interested. Um, I have to change my Dark Souls tier list.
[5026.49s -> 5032.30s]  I have to change my Dark Souls, you know, what I find to be, what's the best Dark Souls? What's the
[5032.30s -> 5038.14s]  best Prime software game? I have to change it. I played Dark Souls 3 recently. I was just kind
[5038.14s -> 5043.96s]  of messing around on the couch. You're like, oh, why not? I'll play Dark Souls 3 for no reason.
[5043.96s -> 5065.18s]  I don't like that game. I don't like that game. I don't like it. Demon's Souls is better. God,
[5065.18s -> 5086.57s]  I knew it was going to pop and it scared me. The skill issue. No, you know what I figured out about
[5086.57s -> 5093.72s]  Dark Souls 3 that I didn't really pay attention to? There, every area has just the annoying group
[5093.72s -> 5098.74s]  of people that are firing projectiles at you from across the map. Think of all the areas in Dark
[5098.74s -> 5102.18s]  Souls 3 and think of how many times you go, wow, this is really fucking annoying. Somebody's just
[5102.18s -> 5119.03s]  firing missiles at me. What's up with that? What's up with that? Hey, guess what? Bloodborne's a
[5119.03s -> 5125.99s]  perfect game. Besides the fact that it's 30 FPS and it's only on PlayStation. Why won't they just,
[5125.99s -> 5135.77s]  just release it for the love of God? You know, they could, Sony could probably say,
[5136.57s -> 5142.57s]  oh, we're increasing the price of Bloodborne Remastered to a hundred dollars and we'd all
[5142.57s -> 5150.14s]  still buy it, right? Like they would, I would buy it. A lot of you would buy it. I mean,
[5150.14s -> 5173.22s]  it would be bullshit. It would be absolute horse shit, but we would. Rich Andy. I would hate it.
[5173.22s -> 5186.30s]  Whatever. I have enough. I need two of these. It has shit graphics, but that's what I mean,
[5186.30s -> 5196.06s]  a remaster. It doesn't have shit graphics. It's just older, like almost 10 years old.
[5196.06s -> 5201.93s]  You're enabling the company to do that in the future. Yeah, that's true. Nevermind.
[5201.93s -> 5207.72s]  Bloodborne sucks. It doesn't. I played literally Bloodborne in Dark Souls 3 back to back,
[5207.72s -> 5215.34s]  just messing around. Polly had never played Bloodborne before. So it was like, holy shit,
[5215.34s -> 5219.75s]  this is amazing. All right. When somebody has not played a From Software game and you know they
[5219.75s -> 5225.19s]  haven't and they're into the series, that's like bringing, that's like your friend and you go watch
[5225.19s -> 5228.55s]  all the Marvel movies back to back and they've never seen it. Or like the Lord of the Rings
[5228.55s -> 5240.39s]  movies. It's just, I can't wait to watch you watch Lord of the Rings, right? It's a better game. I
[5240.39s -> 5255.03s]  don't need to make three of these. No, Marvel was a bad, okay. Yeah, sure. Marvel was a bad example.
[5255.03s -> 5259.50s]  I would have said the same thing about Game of Thrones, but after like season five or six of
[5259.50s -> 5265.06s]  Game of Thrones, it was kind of just like, ah, no, don't, you don't, don't watch it. I remember
[5265.06s -> 5268.90s]  people being like, oh man, Game of Thrones, season seven and season eight are coming out.
[5268.90s -> 5272.26s]  Should I start? Oh, I should definitely start. Should I watch it? And I'm just like, well,
[5274.31s -> 5285.75s]  yeah, yeah. I mean, it's a, it's great. It's a great series. Oh, I can't wait to see what happens.
[5285.75s -> 5292.98s]  Yeah, I know. Me too. Me too. And they're like, what are you talking about? Ah, you know,
[5292.98s -> 5316.79s]  when was the last time you watched the Varys scene? Oh my God. That's right. It's been a while.
[5316.79s -> 5339.70s]  Oh, did I not make any other? What did I, what did I make? How many? I have to make so much of this?
[5339.70s -> 5354.82s]  Okay, so I made, I didn't make any arms. This is good enough though, I think. This, I think this
[5354.82s -> 5370.01s]  is fine. Do we really need to make it? Oh no, I made the torso. Okay, so I need legs. Where's,
[5370.01s -> 5384.07s]  where's that? What is this? I think this is a leg, right? Yeah, I need two of these, but yeah.
[5384.07s -> 5395.24s]  Game of Thrones, we'll see. Wait, isn't there, I said Lord of the Rings, isn't it? Doesn't Lord
[5395.24s -> 5400.28s]  of the Rings and Game of Thrones both have new shit that's available to watch right now? Is it
[5400.28s -> 5412.07s]  worth it? Should I watch it? Is it all right? No, they suck. Do they? I don't know. Do they?
[5412.07s -> 5426.94s]  I think I can make four of these. I haven't heard great things about it. I like Rings of Power.
[5426.94s -> 5438.63s]  Rings of Power is good? Okay. The Lord of the Rings one is good. They suck. Don't let the fan
[5438.63s -> 5447.35s]  boys tell you otherwise. I mean, I don't know. It's so difficult to do that though. I honestly,
[5447.35s -> 5456.31s]  at some point it's like, okay, Lord of the Rings was a thing. They made the Hobbit series and people
[5456.31s -> 5462.60s]  kind of said, mm, these are all right. It's like after the, these are all right. And it was Peter
[5462.60s -> 5473.10s]  Jackson that did that. I don't know. I feel like it's hard to make anything else. I don't know.
[5473.26s -> 5479.67s]  I could be wrong. Is it worse? This guy's got so many. Okay. Hold on. I need one, two, three,
[5479.67s -> 5494.28s]  four. I need four more limbs and two hands. This is elaborate. House of the Dragon is the Hobbit
[5494.28s -> 5502.22s]  of Game of Thrones. Okay. Okay. I actually didn't really hate the Hobbit movies that much. I thought
[5502.22s -> 5508.49s]  they were a little stretched out and a little weird. Some of the CG in the Hobbit movies was
[5508.49s -> 5515.24s]  kind of odd. I remember there was one in particular. There was, there was a lot of CG that kind of just
[5515.24s -> 5521.14s]  felt strange in those movies. It was like really, yeah, it was weird. I need to make more of that
[5521.14s -> 5535.08s]  fluid. House of the Dragon is actually good. This is pretty divided then. I need more pork. Is there
[5535.08s -> 5542.44s]  pork in here? Because they filmed it at 48 instead of 24 FPS. Yeah. It's something like that, right?
[5542.44s -> 5574.52s]  Give it time. I am absolutely not dogging the show. Settle down. It's fine. Would you sell your soul
[5574.52s -> 5580.44s]  for infinite money? No. There's only so much you can buy with money before. It's just like,
[5580.44s -> 5587.75s]  what the fuck else do you, what do you do now? You know what I mean? It's like, oh dude, infinite
[5587.75s -> 5594.30s]  money. Infinite money. All right. So I could get a plane, a boat, and like five houses. Then it's not,
[5594.30s -> 5602.71s]  what else? Okay. What else? Dude, you have infinite money. All right. Can I rebuild it? Okay. Can I
[5602.71s -> 5609.61s]  rebuild every school in America? Can I spend it on other people? Because that might be worth it.
[5609.61s -> 5615.61s]  If I sold my soul for infinite money and I literally fixed every problem in the world,
[5615.61s -> 5618.41s]  and then I would just be essentially the one that had to get sacrificed. I mean that,
[5619.30s -> 5648.12s]  all right. Do I get to have a cool life for like the next 40 or 50 years? Uh, two more, right? I
[5648.12s -> 5655.22s]  mean, if I had infinite money, I would, I don't know, I'd, I'd go all out. I'd go baller mode
[5655.22s -> 5662.18s]  on myself, right? For like, okay, for like five years, you would not hear from me at all, ever.
[5662.18s -> 5666.52s]  I would just disappear and do a bunch of crazy shit as like a billionaire. And then I would come
[5666.52s -> 5674.82s]  back. I had fucking bags under my eyes. Be like, all right, it's time to fix this shit. And I would
[5674.82s -> 5678.02s]  rebuild every school in America. I'd make, I would plant like fucking hundreds of miles worth of
[5678.02s -> 5683.61s]  crops. I would redo our entire education system. I, okay, at that point I'm back and I'm ready to
[5683.61s -> 5690.06s]  go. But you, I get, I get a few years where I'm just going to just fuck off and just, I don't know,
[5690.06s -> 5698.94s]  live on an island and eat like coconuts and shit. And have like, have like 5G internet on the island.
[5698.94s -> 5706.33s]  Just give me, give me like five years for me just to like be a fucking nutcase. And then I'm back
[5706.81s -> 5714.86s]  with like a golden suit and a golden top hat and a golden cane. Who am I kidding? I'd be dead.
[5714.86s -> 5726.71s]  Are you serious? I would, I'd be dead. Oh dude, what would you do with the, with infinite money?
[5727.59s -> 5734.06s]  Well, I would be, I would like bungee jump in a gold suit and way too much and snap the thing and
[5734.06s -> 5754.95s]  die. I mean, you know, I'm being honest. We're just getting assassinated. But, but hold on,
[5754.95s -> 5762.25s]  but what hap, wait, but what about the money? Is it, okay, we got to clarify a few things here.
[5762.25s -> 5768.86s]  Is it a genie scenario where I have to, I have to essentially be alive, right? Like it's me.
[5768.86s -> 5773.59s]  And if I'm not around, I can't just like go like this and wave the gold cane around.
[5773.59s -> 5779.67s]  So, so it's the devil. Is it the devil? Is it a genie? Is it a, how am I coming? What's my
[5779.67s -> 5787.38s]  motivation? Give me some direction here. You get kidnapped. Yeah, but, but that's my point. Like,
[5787.38s -> 5794.82s]  but do I, listen, does, do I have to be like, oh, great powerful sorcerer, I would like a hundred
[5794.82s -> 5811.85s]  dollars to pay for my bar tab. Like, how does this work? We need some context. It's just a credit
[5811.85s -> 5817.43s]  card with no limit and then you don't ever have to pay it back. Okay, but do I have to swipe it or
[5817.43s -> 5822.95s]  can somebody take my infinite credit card thing and use it? Because then, yeah, I am making it
[5822.95s -> 5833.40s]  24 hours. Okay. Oh, breaking news. It seems that this man, Jeremy Albertson from Las Vegas, Nevada,
[5833.96s -> 5840.73s]  has in his possession, crazy enough, the infinite money credit card. Anyone who possesses this card
[5840.73s -> 5846.09s]  can purchase anything in an infinite amount with no repercussions. I would go to the grocery store
[5846.09s -> 5859.18s]  and there'd be a million people waiting for me. No, no, I don't want that thing. It's a golden
[5859.18s -> 5882.79s]  McDonald's card. No, yeah, no fucking way. No, thanks. But if I really had infinite money, yeah,
[5883.51s -> 5889.86s]  I would just disappear. I'd go on a five-year bender and that's not what you guys think it is.
[5889.86s -> 5898.89s]  You know what I mean? That's getting wicked high on the couch for like a week or two straight
[5898.89s -> 5911.22s]  sometimes watching like tool videos, right? You know what I mean? It's not what you think it is.
[5911.22s -> 5934.84s]  Where's the hands? It's clearly exactly what I think it is. No, no, tool, like actual tool videos.
[5935.77s -> 5938.81s]  I'm not going to be sitting there just high, just like,
[5944.41s -> 5950.74s]  it's being like, I know the piece is bent because I watched it. I'm just sitting there like,
[5953.85s -> 5961.70s]  I'm talking, well, I mean, I would probably, I may watch a few of those.
[5961.70s -> 5987.56s]  It wouldn't be the only thing I did. It's taking me like 40 minutes to make this.
[5987.56s -> 6012.25s]  Okay, now we just have to hammer. Oh, it's a hammer. What? Oh, come on. What about a
[6012.25s -> 6018.33s]  McDonald's life pass? What if someone offered you a McDonald's life pass, but to get it one year,
[6018.33s -> 6026.30s]  you have to eat McDonald's every day and nothing else. No, why would I do that? That's not,
[6030.26s -> 6037.56s]  that's not, that isn't, no thanks. How much is a McDonald's meal?
[6037.56s -> 6043.27s]  Okay, if I had to eat three meals at McDonald's a day, that would be, what is a, what's like a
[6043.27s -> 6051.61s]  number, number one or number two, 10, 15 bucks, like 20 bucks, maybe like $16 maybe
[6051.61s -> 6057.50s]  for like two meals or something. All right, so let's just say it's $30 a day. So you're telling
[6057.50s -> 6065.80s]  me, so this is effectively what you were saying and this is why it's not worth it. So $30 a day
[6065.80s -> 6077.11s]  turns into 30 times, uh, seven, right? So that's $210 a week times four. That's $840 a month
[6077.11s -> 6085.72s]  times 12. So you are giving me effectively $10,000 to eat McDonald's every single day.
[6085.72s -> 6092.23s]  No, that's not even close to being enough money. That's $10,000 for a year's worth of McDonald's.
[6092.23s -> 6098.25s]  No, you add two zeros to that. I ain't eating McDonald's every single day for a year for 10
[6098.25s -> 6104.15s]  grand worth of McDonald's. No way. Are you kidding me? Make that, make that 10 million,
[6104.15s -> 6113.98s]  make that a million, then I'll do it. No, actually I wouldn't. No, I wouldn't. I would not eat
[6113.98s -> 6121.21s]  McDonald's every day for a year for a million dollars. You just die. It wasn't, okay, what,
[6121.21s -> 6126.06s]  supersize me was like 30 days. Imagine if it supersized me. He was like, yeah, I'm going to
[6126.06s -> 6130.78s]  eat McDonald's three meals a day every single day for a year. I think he, I don't know if he,
[6130.78s -> 6145.46s]  would he be alive every day? Who is he talking to? You, of course. Who do you think I'm talking to?
[6146.10s -> 6158.44s]  And don't get me wrong. McDonald's is one of my favorite places on earth. And I genuinely mean
[6158.44s -> 6167.13s]  that. I love that place. I wouldn't want to eat it every single day. I wouldn't want to eat ice cream
[6167.13s -> 6183.26s]  every day either. Too much of a good thing kind of sucks. All right, what do I do with this? Would
[6183.26s -> 6193.21s]  you eat ice cream every single day for 10 grand? You have to eat it like twice a day. Would you
[6193.21s -> 6200.58s]  though? No, you wouldn't. I don't, after like a month or two, you'd be like, I feel sick every day.
[6200.58s -> 6205.30s]  And we're talking full fat ice cream. None of this, none of this like oat milk ice cream. None of
[6205.30s -> 6210.18s]  this like lactose free ice cream. We're talking ice cream, ice cream, milk, fat, whole milk,
[6210.18s -> 6227.72s]  cream, ice cream. You have to eat it three times a day. I didn't already do this. Ballast in the
[6227.72s -> 6239.78s]  fountain. What is a ballast? Oh, clay mass and a jerry can. All right, so I need more clay, clay
[6239.78s -> 6259.38s]  mass. Wait, is this pork in here? What's going on? Okay, clay and it's just the same thing I was doing
[6259.38s -> 6270.07s]  before. If they paid for the ice cream, then yes. I feel like it would be the same thing as McDonald's.
[6270.07s -> 6281.46s]  It would be too much. How are you busting myths right now? That's actually a really good question.
[6286.20s -> 6292.95s]  Yeah, what myth am I busting? Oh, right. See if you fly away with balloons. That's what it was.
[6292.95s -> 6299.56s]  What would your, what would your brand of ice cream be? Wait, if I had ice cream, like an ice cream.
[6303.14s -> 6318.78s]  Oh, shit. What would my ice cream flavor be if I would have an ice cream? Shut up. It'd be,
[6318.78s -> 6326.79s]  it'd be a chocolate ice cream. And they would be gobs of cookie dough in it. And I'm talking a
[6326.79s -> 6332.31s]  smooth chocolate ice cream. Not this like, not like the kind of cocoa dark kind of chocolate. No,
[6332.31s -> 6339.98s]  no, no, no, no, no. Smooth milk chocolate ice cream with marshmallow swirls, swirls of like a
[6339.98s -> 6364.79s]  marshmallow fluff, like swirls in it. Cookie dough, not chocolate chips. They get, they're annoying.
[6364.79s -> 6369.70s]  And like cookie, like cookie crumbles, soft cookie crumbles. Wait, that's cookie dough.
[6369.70s -> 6374.94s]  All right. Take out the cookie dough and add like soft cookie, chocolate chip cookie crumbles,
[6374.94s -> 6406.33s]  soft, chewy, and graham crackers. And it would be called the fat fuck. $120 for a chair.
[6407.72s -> 6417.11s]  Wait, this exists? It's called cookie cobblestone? Oh, no, it already exists.
[6417.11s -> 6427.24s]  Cookie cobblestone. What? What this? I need this. Where do I get this? Look at this. This is called
[6427.24s -> 6454.10s]  cookie cobblestone. Where is it? Check this out. Okay. Let me see. Chocolate ice cream,
[6454.10s -> 6458.74s]  cookie dough, marshmallow swirls, and crushed cookie pieces. What? How come they stole this from me?
[6458.74s -> 6465.62s]  This is amazing. I want this right now. This is rocky. You know it's not rocky road. I don't know
[6465.62s -> 6473.74s]  what rocky road tastes like. They must've made this like 10 minutes ago. They must've just made
[6473.74s -> 6485.94s]  this. Okay. Cookie cobblestone. That's my jam right there. I want this. Is this something like,
[6485.94s -> 6496.18s]  it was back in like 2002. It doesn't exist anymore. That looks damn good. Nice job, Eddie's.
[6496.18s -> 6506.30s]  Seriously. We connect on stuff, you and I. Eddie's, you and I get it. I mean, some of the world's best
[6506.30s -> 6513.56s]  ice cream since, you know, since 1928. I'm just saying. I mean, it's the world's, one of the
[6513.56s -> 6537.78s]  world's most tastiest ice creams. Why am I buying bullets? Why am I buying a gun? Stop fighting,
[6537.78s -> 6545.42s]  stop fighting your lip. You want that sponsor so bad? Hey, Eddie's, got a couple of streams coming
[6545.42s -> 6557.30s]  up. Why would anybody sponsor? Why would an ice cream company sponsor this stream? They would open
[6557.30s -> 6576.95s]  up the stream for five minutes and go, nope. Eddie's, I'm available. We're a sponsor. Eddie's
[6576.95s -> 6588.22s]  went out of business. No, it didn't. No, it didn't. Eddie's ice cream. What are you talking about?
[6588.22s -> 6605.26s]  It exists. No, it's not. They have a tweet from 12 hours ago, guys. They're fine. How dare you
[6605.26s -> 6611.77s]  fucking say that? I've actually had them before. I, you know, I love, you know what my favorite,
[6611.77s -> 6615.21s]  let's get, you know, ice cream tier list, ice cream from the grocery store tealers.
[6616.41s -> 6625.66s]  That word tier. You know who I think makes the best in the grocery store ice cream? What do you
[6625.66s -> 6643.02s]  think it is? What do you guys think? You got, you're close. Some of you guys are close. That's right.
[6643.02s -> 6652.23s]  Blue Bunny. Blue Bunny makes the best grocery store ice cream without a doubt. It's by a mile.
[6652.23s -> 6656.15s]  I mean, it's by, it's by a fucking mile. It's not even, it's, I'm not kidding. It's not even close.
[6657.51s -> 6664.62s]  Hold on. Don't even start. Yes, Ben and Jerry's does make the best ice cream,
[6664.62s -> 6671.48s]  but Ben and Jerry's does not really have in the grocery store strawberry ice cream or just
[6671.48s -> 6678.52s]  chocolate ice cream. It's like Jerry Lewis's tonight dough. It's a bunch of wacky shit and
[6678.52s -> 6686.57s]  it's amazing, but I'm talking just straight up chocolate ice cream or strawberry ice cream.
[6686.57s -> 6692.79s]  It's, Blue Bunny makes the best. For anything else, it's Ben and Jerry's. So I know I've said
[6692.79s -> 6698.57s]  that before. It is the best thing you buy at the grocery store. Hands down. Okay. So I think I'm
[6698.57s -> 6706.25s]  ready to do this. I need a potion of helium at the pumping station. This has been a fine chill game.
[6706.25s -> 6714.26s]  We're just, we're just hanging out, having a good time. Blue Bunny only makes novelties. No, they
[6714.26s -> 6719.06s]  don't. I have, I literally have Blue Bunny chocolate ice cream, just chocolate in my freezer right now
[6719.06s -> 6727.82s]  and I eat it all the time. Hillamook is better. Blue Bunny is better. That's my opinion. You have
[6727.82s -> 6731.02s]  to, you're making me prove this. Why would I prove that in ice cream? I just go look it up, type
[6731.10s -> 6743.88s]  Google Blue Bunny chocolate ice cream. I don't have to prove it to you. You don't have it.
[6743.88s -> 6803.40s]  I have it. Okay. I don't know why I have to prove this to everybody. Why does this matter? Why do
[6803.40s -> 6815.58s]  you have to know this? Okay. Blue Bunny chocolate, chocolate ice cream. It's just the standard Blue
[6815.58s -> 6825.18s]  Bunny chocolate ice cream. It's delicious. It's perfect. It's smooth, pillowy. When you scoop it
[6825.18s -> 6867.94s]  out, it makes this like, it's fluffy. It's pillowy. I was anticipating to show you a smooth pillowy.
[6867.94s -> 6878.23s]  I just may have been in there for a while. This may, hold on. Was it exploration? Fuck. I fucked
[6878.23s -> 6916.15s]  it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. No, it's not. It's freezer
[6916.15s -> 6923.22s]  bird. My freezer is fucked up. That's my fault. That's my fault for showing that to you. That is
[6923.22s -> 6928.01s]  not fresh. That I had a freezer problem. That I had to fuck up with my freezer settings. And
[6928.01s -> 6952.57s]  that's what did that. My freezer screwed up. So we're good. Too cold. I don't know. I just,
[6952.57s -> 6960.62s]  I messed up something with my freezer. That looked like, no, it was free. All right. Anyways,
[6960.62s -> 6968.70s]  Blue Bunny is incredibly fluffy. It's smooth. It has an amazing texture. And I know I look really
[6968.70s -> 6974.98s]  odd saying that to you right now, but it's true. It's got a pillowy texture. It's, the mouthfeel
[6974.98s -> 6979.14s]  is perfect. It like disintegrates in the back of your mouth. And it's just, it's perfect. It's
[6979.14s -> 6984.34s]  the best ice cream you can buy. Don't look at what I just showed you. That was, I shouldn't have done
[6984.34s -> 6991.46s]  that. I should have showed it to you when it was ready. Play the game. Do you, you don't care about
[6991.46s -> 7009.10s]  this game. I know you don't. What am I doing? All right. Water. All right. So now I need helium.
[7009.10s -> 7027.42s]  I need, where do I get helium? This looks like helium, right? Where would I get helium? Oh,
[7027.50s -> 7041.90s]  here we go. By the way, I want to say this really clearly too. Strawberry ice cream.
[7044.34s -> 7049.26s]  I like it when there's some strawberries in it. My favorite kind of strawberry ice cream is
[7049.26s -> 7062.17s]  no chunks, just smooth strawberry flavor. How do I make this? Just 90 to 100% helium. That's it.
[7062.17s -> 7086.63s]  Okay. You know, plastic bottle. I need 10 of these. What? Why do I need so much shit? Oh,
[7086.63s -> 7105.91s]  it's three for each one. I get it. All right. It's time to start the experiment. Now I need a chair.
[7105.91s -> 7120.76s]  Page 11. Oh my God. Okay. Get the right pieces for the chair frame. Yeah, I'm done after this.
[7120.76s -> 7126.46s]  We're going to change games. This is cool. This is fine. But I, we gotta change this.
[7126.46s -> 7134.34s]  We're on experiment two. Yeah, but we've paused and had like a stupid shitty podcast
[7134.34s -> 7139.72s]  for at least like 40 minutes of this stream. All right. So I need to do rectangular steel.
[7139.72s -> 7151.37s]  Okay. Wooden beam and wooden cylinder. Wooden beam and wooden cylinder. I gotta change the saw too.
[7151.37s -> 7161.06s]  Really? I would love a German podcast. Um, I, I wouldn't. I wouldn't. This is, we already do it.
[7161.06s -> 7166.12s]  I'm doing it right now. We just do it. This is what we do. Half the streams are just that.
[7166.12s -> 7169.72s]  They, you know, I don't know. Why would I do a podcast? Like we're just already doing it.
[7169.72s -> 7179.38s]  I don't, I would, going on someone's podcast is fine. I think that's fun, but I feel like I
[7179.38s -> 7194.62s]  wouldn't be able to do very much on my podcast. God damn it. This better be worth it. Can I cut?
[7194.62s -> 7204.63s]  Wait, can I? Oh, it's the wrong one. How a metal cutting saw can cut a wooden
[7204.63s -> 7219.37s]  piece of furniture. Okay. I'm sorry. Take it out. How do I unscrew this wrench?
[7219.37s -> 7237.45s]  How do I get rid of this? Oh, this, there we go. Would you play heroes three? Like heroes might
[7237.45s -> 7248.71s]  magic three. I want, wait, back it up. I want to, I want to, what is this? This is a wooden saw.
[7248.71s -> 7266.42s]  Okay. I need to buy it. Um, I wouldn't, if people wanted to see it, I'd probably play it again.
[7266.42s -> 7280.95s]  It was fun. You'd have to want it, right? You have to want to see it. What about Subnautica?
[7280.95s -> 7289.38s]  I, didn't I play Subnautica? I did. Didn't I? I played so many games. I feel like I have played
[7289.38s -> 7318.98s]  it on stream. Haven't I? Play it again. Damn. Okay. That was almost like quadruple. All right,
[7318.98s -> 7325.06s]  we're good. All right. Get the right pieces in the chair frame. I think I got it. Right. I did it.
[7325.06s -> 7348.07s]  I did. Head to the rocket launch site. Let's go. I got to turn the music on. All right. Take Buster
[7348.07s -> 7384.60s]  to the safe zone. Let's go. Where should I play after this? How come this one's the radio? The
[7384.60s -> 7428.95s]  other one wasn't the radio. There you go. Okay. Assemble the chair. Roblox? Oh no. Mount the chair
[7428.95s -> 7446.94s]  and wait, what are you talking about? What's wrong with this? Ah, install six balloons. Well,
[7446.94s -> 7485.48s]  don't go, don't leave yet. Okay. I don't, where is it? I don't have a button anymore. Where's the,
[7485.48s -> 7520.26s]  where's my button? Where's the truck? It's in my fucking pocket. God damn it. See, in that scenario,
[7520.26s -> 7527.83s]  I do not tell anybody that. In that scenario, I drive all the way there. I walk into the warehouse.
[7527.83s -> 7535.02s]  I put my hand in my pocket and I go, oh my God, it's in my pocket. And then I text whoever is on,
[7535.02s -> 7540.92s]  out in the, in the field. And I go, oh yeah, man, still looking for it. Did you, did you touch it?
[7540.92s -> 7545.16s]  You might, I think I saw you have it for like 10 minutes. And then they go, yeah, dude, I had it
[7545.16s -> 7551.50s]  for 10 minutes. Oh fuck. I'm still looking for it, man. I'll find it. And then I text the person
[7551.50s -> 7558.92s]  again in five minutes, selfie under a desk and with a thumbs up, like, got it. Like this is where
[7558.92s -> 7566.18s]  it was. I found it. And everyone's like, yeah. Oh, thank God, Jeremy, you saved the day. You saved,
[7566.18s -> 7584.25s]  you saved the experiment. Let's go. What land on the island? While I'm trying to get points,
[7584.25s -> 7637.59s]  who is that? Why am I doing this? How do I slow down? We're going way too fast. I don't have a
[7637.59s -> 7662.46s]  gun. Wait, what happened? Why? All right, hold on. Unlock the chair. A-W-A-S-D. How am I supposed to
[7662.46s -> 7683.45s]  fly up there? Um, that doesn't make any sense. How am I, how do I do that? Shit. Do it again.
[7683.45s -> 7756.95s]  I can't shoot the- I don't, whatever. Throw it away. Wait, I didn't do it. Yeah, I did. It's fine.
[7756.95s -> 7764.50s]  That was fun. What are we doing next? What should we do now? What do you think? How you guys feel?
[7764.50s -> 7771.91s]  What should we play? I got a few things. Let's do, we can do 20 minutes till dawn. That game was a ton
[7771.91s -> 7781.50s]  of fun. Play Driver. How am I going to, where's, how am I going to get access to Driver? Is Driver
[7781.50s -> 7796.12s]  on Steam? I'll give you some options. You want to do a vote? Yeah, we'll, we'll throw some options
[7796.12s -> 7808.76s]  in there. Okay, let's see. We could do, uh, let's see here. Let me move this. All right, we could do,
[7808.76s -> 7821.18s]  what should I put on the poll? I could put on, call the lamb. Put on, uh, 20 minutes till dawn.
[7821.18s -> 7835.06s]  Put on, what was the other thing you just said? You just said one. What was it? Ultrakill. I feel
[7835.06s -> 7840.15s]  like my, I don't think my brain can handle Ultrakill. I need to really be into it. Driver's not on
[7840.15s -> 7859.67s]  Steam. Where am I going to get access to Driver? Is Driver on Steam? No, it's not. What was the
[7859.67s -> 7866.65s]  thing you just said? Somebody just said something cool. You said, somebody said something cool.
[7866.65s -> 7874.22s]  What was it? All right, let me get the poll going. All right, so we could do, no, not, uh, Gloomwood.
[7874.22s -> 7897.21s]  I'll do Gloomwood on its own stream. Okay, uh, Cult of the Lamb. 20 minutes till dawn. Yeah,
[7897.21s -> 7907.08s]  I can't see. Yeah, we gotta have a third game. No, Sorcerer will be its own day. What else,
[7907.08s -> 7910.78s]  what else can I do? There was something else I wanted to play and I don't remember what it was.
[7910.78s -> 7926.89s]  Somebody said something cool and I forget what the hell it was. Superliminal. All right, or
[7927.85s -> 7935.75s]  what do you think? Oh, it's already active. Wait, wait, what? Oh, the poll, no, no, no,
[7935.75s -> 7943.82s]  the third game is Superliminal. We gotta, we gotta do it with Superliminal on there.
[7943.82s -> 7961.37s]  Superliminal sounds interesting. Uh, stream's gonna be, uh, it's gonna F for a minute while I
[7961.37s -> 7986.87s]  download it. Yeah, kill the poll. We gotta put Superliminal on there. Play Pepsi Man? I would.
[7986.87s -> 7994.71s]  Superliminal is awesome. All right, well, let's do it. Try to do it and forget about the rest of
[7994.71s -> 7998.31s]  the poll. Let's just do it. I'm gonna play Superliminal. Whatever. Things like people
[7998.31s -> 8009.90s]  are into that. Yeah, I'll play it. No, I'm not gonna play Disco Elcium. That game's like 150
[8009.90s -> 8021.88s]  hours long. I'll get 10 minutes into it and be like, oh, I'll play it off stream, guys.
[8021.88s -> 8026.04s]  All right, Superliminal is downloading. Do I, let me refill my drink. I'll be right back
[8026.04s -> 8036.97s]  while it downloads. Superliminal is what we're playing. Get out of, Jesus Christ.
[8041.19s -> 8042.63s]  All right, give me one second. I'll be right back.
