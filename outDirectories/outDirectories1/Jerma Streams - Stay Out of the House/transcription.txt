[1.27s -> 7.46s]  Alright, this one we're playing is Stay Out of the House, which I'm saving this one for probably
[7.46s -> 24.92s]  the last one I do today, because this is probably going to send me into another dimension.
[24.92s -> 56.28s]  Alright, volume. What am I doing about the volume here? How low should I make it?
[56.28s -> 64.71s]  Is it one of those scenarios where this should be like 20%, like 10%? I currently have it at like
[64.71s -> 80.60s]  30% right now. We'll see. 7%. Alright, should I keep? What should I do here? Keep it at
[81.56s -> 112.26s]  turn it off? VHS? CRT off? VHS on? Or everything off? Alright, let's get a poll actually. I feel
[112.26s -> 131.42s]  like people are... Alright, am I doing filters on or filters off? On or off? Let's see. Alright,
[131.42s -> 140.62s]  poll. It seems to be on or off. Is it to turn all these filters on or turn at least one or two of
[140.62s -> 158.70s]  them on? It's literally a two minute poll. Just yes or no. 1999 is kind of scary. Off is winning by
[158.70s -> 182.15s]  a lot. Okay. Well, not a lot, but keep the CRT on. Off is winning by a pretty large margin now.
[182.15s -> 187.69s]  Okay, you guys ready? Let's go. Part one, the night shift. Medium. You might not make it out
[187.69s -> 200.95s]  alive. That's fine. Take the night shift. Yes. Volume is down. Here we go. By the way, I have
[200.95s -> 205.03s]  not been looking forward to this at all. When I knew this came out, I was pissed because I knew
[205.03s -> 211.75s]  I was going to have to play it eventually. I'm pissed off for doing this game up. I need to
[211.75s -> 228.07s]  change the game. Stay out of the house. Here we go. Okay. Want me to pick you up? Yeah, it's too
[228.07s -> 237.05s]  far to walk. Yeah, pick me up. Yeah, it's too far to walk. As if. I'll be conked out by then.
[237.69s -> 275.50s]  I'll have a beer for you later. Have fun. Just in time. Hurry up and punch in. I've got a hot day
[275.50s -> 291.94s]  tonight. Can I play this? Bullshit. You wish. I played this, didn't I? Come on, I've got to go.
[294.74s -> 301.70s]  Did you sweep the floor at least? It's a different game. Oh, okay. Sorry, dude. I was too busy. Hey,
[301.70s -> 308.06s]  Rick left Alyssa's side work to do on your shift. Now I've got to get out of here. Oh yeah, one more
[308.06s -> 315.16s]  thing. I can't find the keys anywhere. The bathrooms are locked up. So go behind the dumpster, I guess.
[316.12s -> 321.80s]  Have a good date. First part is the same. If my calculations are correct, I'll be running
[321.80s -> 335.61s]  third base of one hour and 16.32 seconds. Yeah, I played this. The prologue is the same. Oh,
[335.61s -> 343.08s]  all right. I remember. Yeah, I remember what happens here. This was the worst scare I've ever
[343.08s -> 348.73s]  had in my entire life, I believe. I remember it. It's the prologue. Should I just skip it then?
[348.73s -> 354.49s]  Should I just go to the second part? Or just do it and get it over with? Yeah, this was the worst
[354.49s -> 363.11s]  scare in my entire life. Just do it again. Oh, all right. Fine. All right. Well, you have to do like
[363.11s -> 402.94s]  tasks, right? Oh my god. I gotta turn the FOV down, I think. I gotta clock in. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[402.94s -> 455.19s]  This tasks, right? I have to like sweep the floor and take out the trash. Turn the CRT off. Nice.
[455.19s -> 479.16s]  Okay, that's fun. All right. Where's the, where's my stuff I gotta do? Don't have to like mop shit
[479.16s -> 489.03s]  the dumpster out back. Yeah. Do I have to, I can't, how do I get out of here? Is there a key I can't
[489.03s -> 498.60s]  on the wall or something, right? I just don't remember. Okay. Um, yeah, here it is. Okay.
[498.60s -> 505.29s]  Do better job on the side work. Make sure to be finished when I come back. Okay. Sweep the floors,
[505.29s -> 508.97s]  place items that weren't purchased back where they belong and clean the bathrooms. Yeah. Okay.
[508.97s -> 515.62s]  So the items I have to replace which are not supposed to be in the right and different spot,
[515.62s -> 529.10s]  right? To move them on the wrong shelf. Let's see what it looks like with this off. That's way better.
[529.10s -> 541.67s]  I can actually look at this now. Okay. It's the broom. Thank you. Finally, finally, finally. All
[541.67s -> 550.94s]  right. All right. Uh, the broom is back here somewhere. There it is. All right. Sweep the
[550.94s -> 571.58s]  floors. They make you do all this because the game just makes you do a bunch of boring stuff
[571.58s -> 588.90s]  and then it just fucking screams in your face. We've seen this before. Don't spoil the whole
[588.90s -> 628.97s]  collection. I've already streamed this exact game though. There's a customer come. Hello. Hi. Can you
[628.97s -> 675.53s]  give me $10 on pump five? Yeah. Thanks. What's it? Can I help you? Can you turn the goddamn pump on?
[675.53s -> 708.01s]  Sorry, sir. Okay. Sweeping is done. Now I got to put these items back where they belong. So this is
[708.01s -> 721.46s]  a beer motor oil and chips. Okay. So chips go in the chips aisle, which is, there's a chip here.
[721.46s -> 742.74s]  Is this chips? Well, this is, it goes in here. Where's the gas go? Oh, okay. Here we go. Yeah.
[742.74s -> 772.98s]  Extra cases of, yeah. How do I put it in? All right. Put this down. Okay. I'll put it back.
[772.98s -> 787.13s]  It looks like this is where it goes. Oh, there we go. Okay. Um, so where do I put the beer or the
[787.13s -> 801.26s]  drink? I would think like right here. Yeah. And then this, this is oil now and motor oil.
[805.45s -> 846.50s]  Right here somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. Clean the bathrooms. All right. Okay. Here we go. It's
[846.50s -> 871.67s]  time. Everybody knows what's coming. Here it comes. Here we go. Where's the, it's happening.
[871.67s -> 892.47s]  Where is it? How do I get out of here? Where's the key? He's going to get scared again. I mean,
[892.47s -> 909.26s]  probably. I remember. I remember what happens, but I need to just be able to go to the,
[909.26s -> 946.97s]  to do the dumpster. Where's the key? There's a customer. Hi. Can I help you? Yeah. I just
[946.97s -> 960.14s]  need some cigarette. Okay. Okay. Which brand? Banshee red with filters. There you go. Thanks.
[961.27s -> 974.06s]  Oh, Hey, can I use the bathroom? I can't open it. Well, that's weird. Good luck. Thanks for the
[974.06s -> 1031.43s]  money. Okay. Now, what if I get the key? Can't leave the store. I'm going to try so hard to not
[1031.43s -> 1038.70s]  have the jumpscare do anything. I'm going to try as hard as I can for all the people that are
[1038.70s -> 1041.90s]  trickling in. They're going to be like, what is wrong with this guy? Is he on like drugs? Like,
[1041.90s -> 1064.92s]  why did he not even react? I'm going to try to just be like this, try to, no, not going to happen.
[1065.00s -> 1072.78s]  All right. Do a poll. When the jumpscare happens, will I do a, any reaction at all? Yes or no?
[1074.47s -> 1081.90s]  Let's bet. I'm going to, I'm seriously going to try. I know when the jumpscare happens,
[1081.90s -> 1102.98s]  I'm going to desperately try, uh, do a bet. Will I show any emotion during the jumpscare? Yes or no?
[1102.98s -> 1116.07s]  That's easy money. Well, let's see, put your money where your mouth is then. I know precisely when
[1116.07s -> 1179.26s]  it happens to all in, this is going to be close 20 million versus 12 million points.
[1179.26s -> 1203.64s]  Please don't react. I will try. Okay. It's locked in. Um, how do I proceed the game?
[1203.64s -> 1213.02s]  It has to be absolutely no reaction. I'm talking about this like that. I'm just going to go like
[1213.02s -> 1240.15s]  this. All right. Okay. Like this. Am I missing something here? Am I, am I not pressing a button
[1240.15s -> 1257.45s]  to keep this going? I think I have to play the arcade game. All right. It's coming soon.
[1257.45s -> 1276.71s]  Yeah, I did play this before. This apparently is the prologue to the new one. So that doesn't
[1276.71s -> 1279.83s]  count. That's not, that does not count. That's not what we're talking about. Don't do not pay
[1279.83s -> 1286.68s]  anybody up. Don't pay anybody. Nobody gets paid at all. We're not doing that because that's not
[1286.68s -> 1303.05s]  what I was talking about. That does not count. That's not the jumpscare. Nope. I didn't say
[1303.13s -> 1314.49s]  a jumpscare. I said the jumpscare. No, it doesn't count. That does not count. Dude, I'm dead now.
[1314.49s -> 1360.94s]  All right. Where's this key? Here it is. Please pretend like you've never played before. Yeah,
[1360.94s -> 1372.60s]  I will. Somebody's coming in. There's a customer. Okay. Hi, you're here all alone. No, no, my
[1372.60s -> 1456.01s]  coworkers in the back. What are you getting? Oh, could you help me? I don't remember where the
[1456.01s -> 1461.14s]  sodas are. This whole thing looks the same. Every aisle is the same with items on it.
[1461.14s -> 1464.26s]  It's hard for me to understand where I am. You ever played a level with cement on it?
[1465.94s -> 1504.68s]  I get you, man. I do. Thank you. So what even happens in this game? Wait, oops. Don't tell
[1504.68s -> 1543.85s]  them. Nobody tell them. Okay. How do I open this? Read the note. I've already done everything.
[1543.85s -> 1547.69s]  I swept the floors. I placed the items where in the end and I just need to clean the bathroom.
[1547.69s -> 1562.12s]  But you need the key to do that. Where's the key? Put the volume up. Volume up? It's going to be
[1562.12s -> 1566.20s]  probably really loud. I don't know if I want to do that. Volume up. Are you sure about that? Be
[1566.20s -> 1574.12s]  aware. This could get loud. What was that sound? Something's here. Okay. That was weird sound.
[1574.12s -> 1629.16s]  Okay. I need to find cleaner. Okay. Nothing special. I did not react. That was zero reaction.
[1629.16s -> 1643.26s]  Zero. I win. He blinked. Okay. Here we go. Now we're in the game.
[1663.74s -> 1670.07s]  You died so someone else could live. That's crucifixion now. Amen. Amen.
[1670.07s -> 1715.43s]  You've reacted. Wait, are we playing the game? Turn it up or turn it down? Just be aware of
[1715.43s -> 1734.84s]  these games are loud and like adjust your volume accordingly. Seriously. How long have I been out?
[1734.84s -> 1786.44s]  Was he not back yet? You in there? You're good. Having some trouble with the door. Hold on.
[1814.94s -> 1842.87s]  Oh, I can turn this down. Don't. Coward. I'm just saying the game is loud as fuck and I'm telling
[1842.87s -> 1864.26s]  you I'm warning you for real. Lower your volume. Okay. It's a point where it hurts your ears.
[1864.26s -> 1870.17s]  I'm going to. Okay. I'm saving everybody. I'm bringing the jumpscares down to like
[1870.17s -> 1897.00s]  60% 50%. I'm just telling you. Let me see how loud that is. I'll turn the master volume up.
[1897.00s -> 1943.62s]  Actually, I don't want to do. Don't play the game. Seems like someone lost this. What is that doing?
[1959.38s -> 1963.14s]  Beginning of this upcoming month, all work and productions conducted at the Crawford mill will
[1963.14s -> 1968.22s]  cease to continue due to a lack of business over the past year. The owners unfortunately cannot
[1968.22s -> 1973.85s]  afford to keep the mill open and running. Therefore will be condemned and sold to the state. They'll
[1973.85s -> 1983.13s]  repurpose the building or demolish it. Okay. His wife will be moving away from Cedarville in hopes
[1983.13s -> 1986.89s]  to find a better treatment center close to the city. He sends his deepest apologies to all
[1986.89s -> 1990.65s]  employees who have dedicated their time and efforts toward the betterment of the company.
[1990.65s -> 2062.60s]  Okay. Creepy dog. Hi dog. What's up? Wow. That's a lot. Something bad is going to happen to the dog.
[2062.60s -> 2068.26s]  I already know it and it's going to be so sad and it's going to be, I'm going to be pissed.
[2068.26s -> 2098.78s]  Yep. Something bad is going to happen to the dog. Lala. I can't get through this. Okay. So let's
[2098.78s -> 2148.23s]  just go and go this way. Is a child a teddy bear glasses? Whose dog is this? This is a briefcase.
[2148.23s -> 2170.70s]  God plug it. Hey, hey, hey. Okay. You're not going to give me a goddamn cornfield to go through.
[2170.70s -> 2215.82s]  Are you? Dead end. Yeah. God damn it. All right. I can remember that's there. Okay. I just got to
[2215.82s -> 2293.40s]  go through it. All right, dog. You and me into the cornfield. Oh, it hurts to do this too. Oh,
[2293.40s -> 2297.35s]  what's dog going? Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?
[2297.35s -> 2304.52s]  Where are you going? What are you eating? Don't eat. Don't eat stuff you find on the ground.
[2304.52s -> 2319.18s]  What are you doing? Don't eat stuff on the ground. We're all parishioners. Okay. Assembly of God of
[2319.18s -> 2324.07s]  some unfortunately sudden and upcoming changes to our standards of curriculum. Being sad with a
[2324.07s -> 2332.60s]  heavy heart, our family of religious followers have turned elsewhere. There are a few who, okay.
[2332.60s -> 2336.68s]  They're not following the Bible and it is my understanding that their syllabus is full of
[2336.68s -> 2341.10s]  nonsensical gibberish. I don't know who of what they are worshiping, but friends and colleagues
[2341.10s -> 2352.74s]  of mine have started to treat me as a stranger. Holy shit. Last night while eating with my family,
[2352.74s -> 2357.98s]  a bullet was fired through my kitchen window. It barely missed my head. It has completely
[2357.98s -> 2366.57s]  obliterated one of my favorite paintings given to me by one of my choir members. I'll be leaving
[2366.57s -> 2371.85s]  town. I do not wish to leave, but feel as if I have no choice. And I'd advise anyone who still
[2371.85s -> 2376.79s]  comes to our church to join me towards our new place of hope and prosperity. Thank you for your
[2376.79s -> 2401.46s]  kindness and understanding. Stop. Don't, don't eat that. Don't eat that. Where's the dog? Where's
[2401.46s -> 2425.46s]  the dog? Come over here. Don't waste it. Keep staying with me, please. This way. I don't think
[2425.46s -> 2476.70s]  he wants to come with me. Where's the dog? What should I do? Is there another way to go?
[2480.06s -> 2494.89s]  Through the cornfield? There has to be another way to go. Okay. Thank God that was you.
[2517.40s -> 2561.61s]  Uh, I'm going this way. Uh, uh, huh? What? Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. Oh shit. Okay.
[2561.61s -> 2578.34s]  Good find. What have we? Shirt? What is this? An ID? Weird. What happened here? ID? Our mission,
[2578.34s -> 2584.36s]  the Church of Father's Vision. Goal of the Church of Father's Vision is to create a community
[2584.36s -> 2589.80s]  abundant with repentance and salvation. We will help you attain a growing relationship between
[2589.80s -> 2595.56s]  yourself and the Lord, either at one of our many days of worship in person or via weekly tapes,

[2614.26s -> 2618.73s]  childhood, a married man, father, and beloved pastor. He firmly believes in living by Christ
[2618.73s -> 2622.81s]  through spreading his gospel and encouraging his neighbors to worship the Lord with him at the
[2622.81s -> 2647.48s]  Church of Father's Vision. This is so good. Get off me. Okay. God in his goodness has called on me
[2647.48s -> 2654.94s]  to preach to the world. My desire is to please and glorify him. It's happening in my mouth.
[2654.94s -> 2661.26s]  And I hope to join hands with the world and live by his word. Okay. Dr. Buu and his wife, Margaret
[2661.82s -> 2667.21s]  Buu, hold service at the Church of Father's Vision each Sunday at 1115. Located at this
[2667.21s -> 2672.81s]  Georgetown, Kentucky. VHS tapes and more. Okay. The Church of Father's Vision, let us guide you
[2672.81s -> 2724.18s]  towards righteousness. Anything else I can grab here? A dress? Check under the car? Did I touch
[2724.18s -> 2767.48s]  everything? I think I see everything, right? What are you looking at? I'm just going to leave. I
[2767.48s -> 2810.07s]  don't know what way to go. I think I'm going the other way that I just came. I think I came from
[2810.07s -> 2825.21s]  this way. Dog check. Yeah, this is the church. Is there any other way I can go? Shit, this is
[2825.21s -> 2869.11s]  where the church is. This is nothing here. Is there a direction down here I didn't go? Cement game,
[2869.11s -> 2876.63s]  but it's made out of corn instead. True. All right. I don't think I went this way.
[2903.42s -> 2943.48s]  I don't like it. The name of this game is stay out of the house.
[2943.48s -> 2970.71s]  Why would I go in the house? Where's the dog? I don't know what to do. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[2970.71s -> 3014.89s]  don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. No. Where am I? I'm trying to find you. Where is he?
[3014.89s -> 3058.18s]  What kind of weird house is this? Why is it? No. Upstairs? Where is he? He is down here. Where?
[3063.21s -> 3077.85s]  No. Are you okay? How do I help? Please, please, please, please. How do I help? I need to help.
[3077.85s -> 3088.10s]  You okay? No, no. Bad idea. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Bad idea. Bad idea. What?
[3088.10s -> 3169.78s]  What? It was a bait. It was bait. It was literally bait. I'm taking these up. That was the soap.
[3169.78s -> 3189.10s]  It was bait. It was a Halloween decoration. Should have stayed out of the house, dude.
[3189.10s -> 3229.56s]  This is going to suck. My stomach. What did he do? What's this for? This is going to be a granny
[3229.56s -> 3244.57s]  game. This is a grandma game. Otherwise I can't do these ones. I can't do grandma games. I pitched
[3244.57s -> 3285.38s]  sounds. Is it better? Be quiet. All right. Get me out of here. I think this is like a lamp with
[3285.38s -> 3388.41s]  skin. How do I get the fuck out of here? Heal the cage back. Upper back corner. What do I just do?
[3388.41s -> 3411.48s]  Turn light on. Fuck you. Oh, fuck you. Don't even. Hold on. Can I do anything over here?
[3440.26s -> 3475.02s]  I just filled that with gas? What the fuck is in here? It's a clock. Dude, where should I put it?
[3485.59s -> 3496.36s]  Light meter? It's set to nine o'clock. Should I remember that? Okay. Nine o'clock. Toolbox is
[3496.36s -> 3521.08s]  locked. Where should I bring this? I don't know. Just turn all the lights on maybe first. There's
[3521.08s -> 3548.12s]  another way to go. I'm going to bring that into here. The clock. He hates. What'd you say? I'm
[3548.12s -> 3563.64s]  really not. Honestly, I'm really not good at granny likes. Oh, fuck you. Night shift abductors
[3563.64s -> 3575.99s]  strikes again. Granny likes. Yeah. So what a granny like is a game where you is a game where
[3575.99s -> 3582.23s]  you have to pick up like rope. Bring the rope downstairs to grab that thing. When you grab that
[3582.23s -> 3586.07s]  thing, there's bubble gum in it. You take the bubble gum up to the room upstairs and put it
[3586.07s -> 3590.71s]  under the sink to plug the hole. Then you can get the water with the cup that you have to find down
[3590.71s -> 3595.19s]  in the basement, which you can only get there if you open the door with the key that you find
[3595.19s -> 3609.61s]  underneath the bed. I'm not good at granny likes. 34 year old Deborah is the latest victim of the
[3609.61s -> 3618.30s]  notorious night shift abductor relocation show video evidence of the same abductor
[3618.30s -> 3621.10s]  at multiple locations between Custer County and its surrounding areas.
[3621.98s -> 3626.38s]  All six abductions have had very similar circumstances. He was alone in the shift
[3626.38s -> 3630.14s]  in the dead of night was confronted by the assailant after a period of observation
[3630.14s -> 3644.36s]  when the venue was at a period of little to no business. Okay. Okay. He's mid to late 30s
[3644.36s -> 3649.40s]  standing at roughly six four and assumed 250 pounds. Very few other details of the assailant
[3649.40s -> 3654.12s]  are known. His identity as well as concealed during the assault via a makeshift burlap mask
[3654.12s -> 3669.50s]  and thick seasonal clothing. Okay. Okay. These incidents do not appear to be slowing down
[3670.22s -> 3674.22s]  much longer. Are we to expect this to the slow unproductive case to continue?
[3674.94s -> 3695.86s]  You better not start. You're going to start moving. Aren't you paperclip? Thank you. Valley
[3695.86s -> 3701.06s]  cover versus brand new lock has a preset code, which cannot be changed. We would advise storing
[3701.06s -> 3713.61s]  this paper. So, okay. Combination is four question mark 62 or something six two. All right. That's
[3713.61s -> 3751.27s]  for the padlock that was in the other room or something. Oh my God. No, or something six two.
[3751.27s -> 3767.27s]  Let's brute force it. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. What do I do? What? How do I turn it off?
[3767.27s -> 3771.51s]  Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Quiet. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. Shut up.
[3771.51s -> 3798.78s]  Shut the fuck up. Where do I go? How do I hide from this guy? Oh my God. Under the bed. He's
[3798.78s -> 3838.62s]  not here. Screwdriver. Got it. Okay. Screwdriver. Undo the, uh, undo. Okay. This is the thing with
[3838.62s -> 3871.00s]  the gas. Where's the room with the gas in it? Fuck you. I hate granny likes. So unscrew it. Um, excuse
[3871.00s -> 3950.54s]  me. I have a screwdriver in my hand. Is there, can I save the game? Wood, water, water, as well as
[3950.54s -> 3976.47s]  medical tools and treatments. Oh, oh, okay. That's very, very appreciated. I can only save the game
[3976.47s -> 3995.64s]  like three times. Yeah, that was loud too, wasn't it? Dude, it's fucking loud. I'm bringing like this
[3995.64s -> 4107.27s]  down just like to 90. You know what I mean? It's loud. What? Okay. So I just keep going. The camera?
[4112.95s -> 4122.42s]  Blind. What? Blind? What do you mean blind? I missed something. What'd I miss? It's intense.
[4122.42s -> 4151.38s]  I'm terrified. What'd I miss? I miss something. Miss something. Oh, it feels like I've been locked
[4151.38s -> 4155.69s]  in this house for weeks, but it's only been a few days. I'm losing track of time. I hear wailing
[4155.69s -> 4161.98s]  coming from under the house. What is he doing down there? I can't thinking about that. There were
[4161.98s -> 4167.22s]  tunnels down there. It looked like they went on forever. I tried to escape, but he caught me with
[4167.22s -> 4174.78s]  that damn radar. He locked me back upstairs, but I saw where he keeps the radar. Locked it in the
[4174.78s -> 4203.21s]  closet. The combination was five, two, nine, one. Don't forget that number. Jesus. What did it say?
[4225.78s -> 4246.26s]  Locked? Do I have a key for this? Yeah. Fucking granny. Can I sneak it? Right. Are they even alive?
[4262.38s -> 4269.74s]  What door? Where am I? No, not the fucking house.
[4273.82s -> 4277.10s]  Quick, take everything I can. Take the hand. Take the hand. Take the hand. I can't.
[4282.62s -> 4295.34s]  Oh, I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Fuck. Two days remain. I'm not going to be able to be a granny
[4295.34s -> 4332.10s]  like it. I don't. I will. I've never completed a granny like it's never happened. Where am I now?
[4332.10s -> 4378.62s]  Dude, what is going on right now? What the fuck? Do I have to stare at this? What's going on? Look
[4378.62s -> 4405.40s]  at me. I keep doing this. Ow. I'm so glad I turned it down. Sacrifice. And that's at like 50%. Where
[4405.40s -> 4428.60s]  am I now? I'm turning it down even more. Turn it down. Turn it down. Turn it down. Turn it down.
[4433.82s -> 4462.65s]  I'm dead. Take the door hinges off. These games are so fucked up. I'm not turning it up. Is it?
[4462.65s -> 4497.18s]  Is that actually it? Or is there more? I think I lost the house. So there's a part four. You lost.
[4497.18s -> 4503.53s]  Yeah. I got the bad ending. All right. Should I try this one more time? I feel like I'm never
[4503.53s -> 4523.18s]  going to beat this. Okay. I'm going to try it again. Turn it back up a little bit. I try one
[4523.18s -> 4545.58s]  more time. I usually don't play granny likes. I really don't. Granny likes are cool, but there's
[4545.58s -> 4550.14s]  so much intense shit going on that my brain only can focus on the scary parts and I can't figure
[4550.14s -> 4569.58s]  out where the bubble gum goes. Yeah. This part. There was another place I could go down too,
[4569.58s -> 4581.61s]  wasn't there? Just say survival horror. Well, not every survival horror is a granny like.
[4581.61s -> 4611.14s]  I'm going to go back down to where that place where I was before. This way, right? There were
[4611.14s -> 4624.82s]  two places to go down. I kind of feel like I want to. No, not this way. All right. I got to stop
[4624.82s -> 4635.51s]  looking at chat. I got to pay attention to where the fuck I'm going. All right. This way. Okay.
[4635.51s -> 4648.23s]  This time don't wake the grandma. What? What's happening? Why did I? I just, I just moved.
[4648.23s -> 4679.08s]  My body just moved all over the place. What am I looking at here? Huh? What? Bandages. That's it,
[4679.08s -> 4711.22s]  right? Locked. How do I get the fuck out of here? Am I stuck in here? Can't reach. Grab climbing.
[4715.06s -> 4744.50s]  Oh my God, dude. Go for, go forward. Go. So that was what was on the other side. Okay. Don't
[4744.50s -> 4775.27s]  go near granny. It's all locked. It's in here. Toilet. Toilet lid. Paperclip. Can I use it? I
[4775.27s -> 4789.58s]  think I could use this on locked doors, right? It shows a crowd draining a man's blood. Is it
[4789.58s -> 4828.41s]  like a little remote controlled car going around the halls? I think I can hide in here. All right.
[4828.41s -> 4849.58s]  I got a hammer. Titanium lock. Okay. I have a couple of, uh, I can pick some locks, right?
[4849.58s -> 4893.93s]  Let's try picking a lock. I can't pick this. Okay. We saw this already. You got to use the
[4893.93s -> 4906.15s]  paperclip. Okay. I remember doing. Yep. This is, did I do the? Yeah. I already got it. Okay. So now
[4906.15s -> 5044.39s]  how do I use the paper clips? Okay. So I can't do anything else up here. What is that? Hit him in
[5044.39s -> 5063.48s]  the back of the head with a hammer. I don't know. I can't see him. No, no, no. Don't come in here.
[5063.48s -> 5118.42s]  Where is he? I don't know. Is he left or right? Oh, please. I'm going to set it up right here.
[5118.42s -> 5136.50s]  Ding dong. Come and fucking get me right here. Come and get me. Come and get me. Hammer. You need
[5136.50s -> 5180.79s]  to R1, R1, R1 granny. Am I going to touch this? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Oh my God. Oh,
[5180.79s -> 5193.48s]  no. He turned the gas on. I don't think I can swing. This game is so fucking horrible. I just,
[5194.04s -> 5206.74s]  I'm too like, I'm too like erratic to play these. And I had, I had, I tried to hit him with the
[5206.74s -> 5221.91s]  hammer. I couldn't hit. You need to calm down. All right. I'm going to try to reload the game.
[5221.91s -> 5226.74s]  I'm going to try it one more time and I'm going to calm down. I'm going to calm down. Here we go.
[5226.74s -> 5235.83s]  I'm going to do it very calmly. I don't do, I can't play granny legs. I told you I installed
[5236.73s -> 5244.92s]  granny too. And when I found out that I had to go up the stairs, pick up the hammer or pick up the
[5244.92s -> 5250.42s]  wood and go down the stairs, I was like, I held my finger on the button on the iPad and then
[5250.42s -> 5263.99s]  press the X button. I can't play granny legs. I can't do it. Rock. Hold on. Wait, can I throw,
[5263.99s -> 5298.25s]  I'm going to try to throw a rock at granny's head. Will this work? Did I hit her? How did I drop the
[5298.25s -> 5326.31s]  rock on the ground? Oh, I think I, I don't think I can do it. I'm too fucked up. End of the stream
[5326.31s -> 5349.03s]  voice. Um, no, no, not yet. I love, okay. I like, I like these games. I like watching people play
[5349.03s -> 5356.01s]  these games and know what they're doing. See me. I, I just like walk up to granny and she screams at
[5356.01s -> 5379.27s]  me. And then I sprint around in a circle and try to hide under the bed and die. True. Was there
[5379.27s -> 5390.28s]  anything even in here? I don't think so. It was a bandage, but like that's going to help. Yeah,
[5390.28s -> 5405.72s]  there's nothing, there's nothing here. I remember getting stuck here though. Okay. All right. Oh,
[5405.72s -> 5413.54s]  come on. Not even a hard game. What do you have here? What do you, what's this? What do I do? Can
[5413.54s -> 5421.32s]  I touch something? Lock? Um, nothing on the ground in here. This is locked. I need to, I can't open
[5421.32s -> 5463.80s]  it. She's coming back now. Um, I gotta turn this off somehow. Shit. Cardboard box. Nothing, nothing.
[5463.80s -> 5520.04s]  Oh, another vent. Okay. Unscrew it please. Unscrew it. Hot steam. I could die. What the fuck was that?
[5520.04s -> 5547.13s]  What? I just, what did I just do? I can't take it off. This is a way to escape. I see this. I'm too
[5547.13s -> 5556.10s]  s- I'm, I don't get this part. Can I turn this off with anything? Probably. I gotta go upstairs and
[5556.10s -> 5580.46s]  in the bathroom and pick up the gum and bring the gum down here and plug it. Um, I don't, I don't
[5580.46s -> 5592.46s]  know. I don't have anything to open this with. What about this? Wait, this is where I just was,
[5592.46s -> 5605.40s]  right? Yeah. What did I just hear? Can I just go through this room? Stop. Who's coming? I don't,
[5605.40s -> 5616.47s]  I can't go through there. All right. I do have to go upstairs. It was, there was a code that I had,
[5616.47s -> 5642.84s]  right? In the closet. Five two something. I just don't know where that is. You stupid motherfucker.
[5642.84s -> 5658.98s]  I hate your guts. You suck. I'm done. I can't do it. I'm done. I'm done. I can't do it. I can't do
[5658.98s -> 5665.05s]  the granny likes. I can't like run up and down the stairs. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do
[5665.05s -> 5670.65s]  it. It's, I, I, I have to, I can't do it. I can't do it. All right. So we're going to, all right.
[5671.21s -> 5684.23s]  The code was five two nine one. I don't know what, I don't know where to put it.
[5687.06s -> 5693.72s]  Skill issue. Yeah. I just don't, I don't play granny likes. It's a good game. All right. We're
[5693.72s -> 5707.77s]  going to play something else. What else we got? We have first one. Do it your way. My way doesn't
[5707.77s -> 5710.41s]  work because you have to, if you get spotted, they kill you.
