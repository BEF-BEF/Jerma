[0.38s -> 18.38s]  Hello. How are you? I'll wait until you say good. Good. Good. Bad. Why? What's the best chat color?
[20.26s -> 31.94s]  Um, I'm more of a prehensical myself. That light kind of pale orange color.
[32.66s -> 47.46s]  Somebody said, uh, awful. That color sucks. That color's fine. Oh wait, wait, wait. Can you change
[47.46s -> 56.97s]  your color? Can you guys all make your colors orange? Wait, have I had the same color
[57.85s -> 66.20s]  for like five years on Twitch? I have, haven't I? I've only been this lime green forever.
[67.16s -> 76.12s]  I've never changed color. I thought that just meant I was the streamer. I think that I could,
[76.12s -> 84.22s]  how do I change it? I don't think I want to. It's been that lime green since I made this
[84.22s -> 100.18s]  account. What a revelation I'm getting right now. Now it's too recognizable. Yeah, I'm just the
[100.18s -> 115.26s]  green guy. How am I doing? I'm doing pretty good. I'm just hanging up. I forgot you could
[115.26s -> 119.74s]  change color. I didn't think you could. I don't know why, because people, I don't know,
[119.74s -> 123.26s]  I thought it was just, I thought it was every new account you could change color.
[132.68s -> 138.23s]  I don't know. How do I do it? I'm scared though, because I'm, okay, I'm clicking on
[138.23s -> 143.50s]  the chat. I'm scrolling around. I see emotes. Where's the change color button?
[145.94s -> 154.28s]  Chat settings. Edit appearance? I feel like it's going to crash my account.
[154.92s -> 160.12s]  I've been green for too long. Nah, okay, I know where it is. All right, that's fine.
[160.12s -> 167.06s]  Anyways, today we're going to do Dark Souls remastered, except not the regular Dark Souls
[167.06s -> 175.45s]  remastered. We're doing Dark Souls remastered randomizer. Got a lot of requests to do this
[175.45s -> 179.13s]  over the last few months or so, the last six months or so, people have really
[180.17s -> 187.30s]  been talking about this. This is going to randomize, and I can set the parameters. I have
[187.30s -> 194.81s]  it, I have it pretty basic right now. This is randomizing every item in the game. This
[194.81s -> 205.18s]  randomize every enemy in the game. I think I'm going to have random armor on and a random
[205.18s -> 218.73s]  enemy. I can also change it to be every single enemy can be one enemy, so I can actually just
[218.73s -> 225.59s]  fight. Well, I don't want to spoil it, because it's something I want to do. Dermot lied about
[225.59s -> 231.64s]  the clown car. He's going to be changing his name at some point over the summer,
[233.22s -> 240.98s]  but thank you for the five community subs. Appreciate it. All pinwheels. Well, don't ruin
[240.98s -> 247.37s]  the joke already. There's a couple of different playthroughs I want to do here.
[250.07s -> 257.91s]  I'm going to try... how hard do you think that would be to play through the whole game against
[257.91s -> 268.01s]  pinwheel? Every enemy, every boss is pinwheel. Do you think I could do that in two hours?
[268.65s -> 282.44s]  I kind of just have to run to the end, right? Anyways, it's ready. Hopefully the game
[282.44s -> 292.07s]  doesn't break, because I have random enemies and random items. They're going to keep
[292.07s -> 300.92s]  cloning themselves, so it's going to be kind of hard. Make every enemy a wheel skeleton.
[301.64s -> 310.34s]  Look, my goal here is to see if I can get to the first boss. How random? Everything is random.
[315.29s -> 321.16s]  Just to test it, I made it so bosses can't randomly just spawn in. Everything else is
[321.16s -> 325.80s]  completely random. I can change that, but I just wanted to see if this works, because I
[325.80s -> 331.45s]  didn't really want to test it because I didn't want to see it. We can go back and fix that.
[335.14s -> 343.96s]  There's a lot to do. But anyways, welcome everybody. Let's get started. I'm going to do new game.
[350.82s -> 356.36s]  Already have stuff. What do I have? What is that? Oh, it's best shield in the game?
[356.36s -> 375.56s]  All right. I don't even know what this stuff is. You're in the chef costume. Brand... oh yeah,
[375.56s -> 382.60s]  random name. Right, yeah, random name. That's true. What am I thinking? I can't do this shit.
[383.24s -> 391.32s]  Random name. Is there a name generator online? Random name generator. There has to be one of
[391.32s -> 405.82s]  these. Random name generator. This website can suggest names for babies. Why would you
[405.82s -> 414.81s]  fucking have a random website generate your baby's name? Okay, I'm just going to do
[414.81s -> 428.79s]  generate name. First, first name only. A masculine first name. Random. Generate a life story.
[428.79s -> 439.91s]  What the fuck is this website? I can generate a life story? Okay, I'm going for it. Okay,
[439.91s -> 451.91s]  so I've got, uh, Waldemar Manfredi, masculine, elderly, adult, nationality, German, from Bavaria,
[451.99s -> 467.78s]  aged 84, physical, 5'9", right-handed, blood O-type, and is gonna die by heart disease
[467.78s -> 472.82s]  in less than like six years. This character's like dead. All right, Waldemar Manfredi.
[481.34s -> 501.74s]  Okay, uh, class, uh, randomized. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[501.82s -> 517.48s]  what's going on here? What? Oh, it's, oh yeah, it's random. The bandit? What is that? I don't
[517.48s -> 531.46s]  think I've ever even seen that item in the game. Two swords? There's another giant hammer?
[536.01s -> 556.70s]  I mean, look at that bandit hammer though. I'm going for bandit. Gift.
[557.34s -> 570.02s]  Binoculars. No, no, no, this is important. Uh, fire bomb. Physique. I feel like, is that
[570.02s -> 593.10s]  random? Tiny head. Just make him a pear. I kind of like the pear. Face. All right, here we go.
[594.06s -> 632.66s]  We have to do random, right? Is there a way I can just do random? All right, I just took a
[632.66s -> 644.46s]  picture of my face every day for 10 years. That's just one of these YouTube videos. I
[644.46s -> 661.98s]  didn't have it on different. Oh, wait, wait. Oops. I don't know when to stop. All right,
[661.98s -> 666.70s]  I'm going to do 30 more times. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
[666.70s -> 671.34s]  17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. No, I already had a blue person. I
[671.34s -> 683.93s]  had a blue character before. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
[683.93s -> 689.53s]  12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
[689.53s -> 725.67s]  This is a sunburned dad. No, that's fine. That's good to me. Yeah, that looks good to
[725.67s -> 741.13s]  me. I'm ready. I'm ready to test it. You ready for the test? Start the game with this
[741.13s -> 745.88s]  character. Here we go. It's going to be loud. You can't turn down cutscenes. Turn your volume
[745.88s -> 755.62s]  down. You guys have seen this cutscene a fucking hundred times. What is that?
[762.74s -> 769.22s]  It's a bush. Who's in there?
[769.86s -> 781.88s]  And in this land, the undead are caught.
[781.88s -> 799.88s]  Are those crystal lizards? Here I am. So what is this weapon?
[799.88s -> 801.72s]  This is your fate.
[801.72s -> 813.19s]  Okay, I would have laughed so hard if that randomized that rat or something.
[813.19s -> 815.83s]  I can't remember how to play this game. It's been a long time.
[826.62s -> 842.14s]  Thank you. Look at that beef jerky. Slim Jim. All right, here we go.
[844.38s -> 847.18s]  Dungeon cell key. I thought it was supposed to be random items.
[865.14s -> 872.28s]  It's okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. What is that? What is that? Sif?
[883.10s -> 887.00s]  This is too much. I thought I made it so it couldn't do this.
[887.80s -> 912.92s]  Just give me my weapon. Wait, that's a boss. Oh, oh, right. That's the asylum demon.
[912.92s -> 917.32s]  I'm so confused. Oh, it's just. Look at how laggy this is.
[918.84s -> 929.16s]  How am I going to be able to beat Sif at level zero? Does he still come to the same place?
[929.88s -> 962.70s]  Where is he? Oh, what? Can he not come down? Do I have a bow and arrow?
[963.34s -> 969.54s]  Hold on. I think I can get him. Can I get him from the other side?
[970.34s -> 987.54s]  Because the asylum demon jumps down, I guess. Go for the egg thing.
[989.75s -> 992.07s]  Oh my god. Hold on. Those things are late game, aren't they?
[992.79s -> 999.38s]  I can't even equip my thing yet. Okay, hold on.
[1000.02s -> 1026.90s]  These things are easy. I don't remember. Blacksmith giant hammer.
[1027.54s -> 1035.27s]  I gotta put that on right now. Hold on. Insufficient strength to wield this.
[1042.98s -> 1045.54s]  This thing sucks. Why did you guys tell me to get this?
[1046.10s -> 1077.90s]  Give me the Estus. Is it actually good? Okay, thanks.
[1081.19s -> 1083.19s]  Take this off. I'm not even going to use it. All right, so hold on.
[1083.83s -> 1090.82s]  Let me see the stats here. I have to go actually into my equipment.
[1092.95s -> 1108.02s]  Do I? No. 237. That's actually pretty good. Minus 83.
[1108.02s -> 1110.26s]  I need 16 strength to hold it in one hand.
[1118.90s -> 1122.90s]  That's like mankind off the fucking top of the cage.
[1126.90s -> 1132.22s]  Somebody's dead. How the hell are you a normal enemy?
[1133.40s -> 1137.67s]  Actually, is this an electric divide? The shield is actually good.
[1137.67s -> 1143.45s]  Keep the shield on. Is it? Oh, it's the grass crest shield.
[1143.69s -> 1148.92s]  Yeah, right. Why is it? Okay, cool. This is the stamina one.
[1148.92s -> 1159.59s]  I forgot about this thing. Oh, Jesus Christ.
[1160.15s -> 1171.05s]  I gotta fight the Capra demon up here? That's not gonna happen.
[1171.05s -> 1173.69s]  I have to reload this and redo the randomization.
[1180.39s -> 1188.47s]  I fucking hate fat rolling. Drink something quick.
[1194.02s -> 1208.47s]  I can't even fucking move. I'm taking off all my armor.
[1208.47s -> 1215.90s]  I can kill this guy. Let's go. I got this.
[1216.54s -> 1238.15s]  Now that I can actually maneuver around. Let's go.
[1238.71s -> 1245.32s]  What? All right, let's go Capra. Firebomb.
[1245.88s -> 1248.63s]  I feel like these should all be randomized too.
[1249.19s -> 1255.06s]  I think the whole thing should be. All right, let's go Capra demon.
[1255.06s -> 1259.10s]  Where'd he go? Where the hell is he?
[1267.13s -> 1270.49s]  Where did the Capra... Am I losing my mind?
[1270.49s -> 1271.37s]  Where the fuck did he go?
[1273.43s -> 1276.07s]  You pre-recorded stream not wearing hat.
[1277.24s -> 1294.78s]  All right, settle down. 389 damage.
[1295.34s -> 1305.94s]  There's another rat in here. This is doing so much damage.
[1308.49s -> 1313.21s]  I think the asylum is toned down so you can actually get out.
[1313.21s -> 1332.79s]  But can I get out? What?
[1332.79s -> 1335.93s]  Oh, what? I thought it was Sif.
[1336.73s -> 1339.61s]  What is happening? I'm so confused right now.
[1348.73s -> 1351.61s]  Stop doing the same move. He's dead.
[1352.58s -> 1358.81s]  All right, wait. Sif was the other one.
[1358.81s -> 1360.57s]  All right, for the one that you can fall down.
[1360.57s -> 1364.06s]  Right, right, right. Okay. Nice.
[1364.86s -> 1379.08s]  This thing is pretty good. This is so stupid.
[1379.80s -> 1386.70s]  And you've doubted us. I don't know why. Why would I ever doubt you guys?
[1396.55s -> 1400.39s]  I really hope it's like Gwyn flying over here to pick me up.
[1402.71s -> 1403.59s]  No, that's too bad.
[1417.85s -> 1424.65s]  How long am I gonna do this for?
[1425.53s -> 1428.33s]  Until I get to a point where it is no longer feasible.
[1433.13s -> 1435.29s]  And then I'm gonna go absolute psycho mode.
[1438.39s -> 1441.19s]  This is essentially just the test to make sure it's possible.
[1441.19s -> 1442.55s]  And then we do it again.
[1442.55s -> 1463.02s]  You're gonna get over-encumbered in 10 minutes.
[1463.02s -> 1463.82s]  No, I'll be all right.
[1471.88s -> 1474.60s]  Tiny being's ring. What's the tiny being's ring?
[1477.14s -> 1486.25s]  I'll take it. Let's go. I'm ready.
[1486.25s -> 1489.32s]  Let's go fight the gold guy.
[1496.36s -> 1498.68s]  This is like a storyline DLC guy, isn't it?
[1503.48s -> 1506.04s]  1500. Guys, if we get some...
[1507.26s -> 1508.46s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[1526.02s -> 1527.14s]  It's the phone column.
[1531.64s -> 1534.12s]  Oh, wait. Will he fall off the edge?
[1534.76s -> 1537.08s]  He's stupid, right? He's too big to be over here.
[1537.08s -> 1538.52s]  He'll fall off if he swings this way.
[1539.24s -> 1552.71s]  Oh, great. They're all just single file coming down this way.
[1557.34s -> 1558.30s]  Oh, Jesus.
[1560.14s -> 1561.82s]  Watch out for the mushroom. Watch out for the mushroom. Watch out.
[1571.38s -> 1573.70s]  Slowly the phone column is making its way over here.
[1582.54s -> 1588.60s]  God. And you wonder why I didn't turn bosses on initially.
[1588.60s -> 1589.32s]  This is hell.
[1592.60s -> 1594.44s]  Holy shit. I thought I just got one punched.
[1595.58s -> 1596.86s]  That was really close.
[1601.70s -> 1603.91s]  It's like that was a...
[1603.91s -> 1605.35s]  I wouldn't have paid for that pay-per-view.
[1605.35s -> 1606.39s]  I would have wanted my money back.
[1620.25s -> 1620.97s]  Okay, we're fine.
[1623.45s -> 1624.17s]  Got it.
[1624.17s -> 1632.68s]  I'm just gonna go level up again.
[1632.68s -> 1634.20s]  Why wouldn't I? Just wait.
[1634.92s -> 1636.71s]  Oh, gold pine risen.
[1636.71s -> 1637.51s]  Nice. All right, hold on.
[1638.15s -> 1650.65s]  Just a shit... an absolute shit lot of vitality.
[1651.61s -> 1653.98s]  All right, I'm taking on the fucking golden guy up here.
[1657.75s -> 1658.95s]  They will respawn.
[1660.31s -> 1661.03s]  That's right.
[1661.83s -> 1662.87s]  I forgot.
[1663.51s -> 1665.59s]  I forgot what game I was playing.
[1668.15s -> 1669.59s]  Oh, god damn it, man.
[1669.59s -> 1671.59s]  Like that... this is gonna be impossible.
[1671.59s -> 1672.47s]  I'm gonna have to just run.
[1674.70s -> 1675.74s]  A hundred and eleven.
[1677.30s -> 1677.54s]  Bye.
[1678.18s -> 1681.66s]  What the fuck?
[1681.66s -> 1682.46s]  What is that?
[1683.02s -> 1686.23s]  Hold on. Every item is randomized, so I have to try to get them.
[1686.79s -> 1692.97s]  Hello?
[1692.97s -> 1696.79s]  You can't... you cannot come over here, can you?
[1696.79s -> 1697.91s]  There's no way he can come over here.
[1703.37s -> 1704.09s]  Do I not get...
[1704.09s -> 1706.09s]  Okay, I was gonna say, do I not get the souls?
[1713.00s -> 1715.16s]  Miracle great heal and twin humanities.
[1715.16s -> 1716.52s]  What's the other ring that I just picked up?
[1718.17s -> 1719.45s]  Boost curse resistance.
[1719.45s -> 1720.41s]  Just put it on.
[1720.41s -> 1722.26s]  Might as well just have it on.
[1724.25s -> 1724.65s]  All right.
[1724.65s -> 1725.77s]  This is the safe zone here.
[1731.74s -> 1732.06s]  Okay.
[1734.23s -> 1740.01s]  I... I forgot that it's not left button.
[1740.01s -> 1740.73s]  It's not... hold on.
[1740.73s -> 1741.37s]  Just listen to me.
[1742.73s -> 1745.29s]  You have to... you have to tap dodge again.
[1745.29s -> 1747.45s]  I was clicking in left stick.
[1748.17s -> 1750.76s]  It doesn't matter.
[1750.76s -> 1752.12s]  I'll be fine.
[1752.12s -> 1761.66s]  He dropped an item down there, though.
[1763.99s -> 1764.47s]  I don't care.
[1764.47s -> 1765.03s]  Fuck it.
[1765.03s -> 1765.67s]  What am I gonna go?
[1765.67s -> 1766.63s]  Collect all that shit?
[1766.63s -> 1766.87s]  No.
[1773.18s -> 1774.14s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[1775.02s -> 1781.18s]  Dragon scale and a sorcerer's catalyst.
[1788.17s -> 1788.97s]  Okay, hold on.
[1790.58s -> 1792.18s]  The items... I have to pick them up.
[1798.28s -> 1799.96s]  Chester's long coat.
[1799.96s -> 1812.28s]  Hold on.
[1812.28s -> 1812.92s]  Damn.
[1812.92s -> 1813.64s]  I'll put this on.
[1814.28s -> 1816.30s]  It's mid roll, sorry.
[1817.02s -> 1830.06s]  That's not gonna do anything.
[1838.06s -> 1843.48s]  I can't even cross the bridge.
[1844.20s -> 1853.46s]  I just gotta run.
[1854.47s -> 1856.55s]  There's no way you're gonna be able to do that.
[1856.55s -> 1857.11s]  You have to run.
[1857.83s -> 1858.55s]  You gotta get to...
[1859.19s -> 1861.35s]  Killing one of these things is 5,000 souls.
[1861.99s -> 1873.02s]  Out of my way.
[1873.02s -> 1878.90s]  Just run to the bonfire.
[1879.54s -> 1881.10s]  I should be fine.
[1882.06s -> 1885.58s]  I gotta maneuver my way.
[1885.58s -> 1886.38s]  Maybe go up top?
[1888.18s -> 1889.22s]  You motherfucker.
[1891.80s -> 1892.84s]  Oh, you dick.
[1892.84s -> 1893.24s]  How did you...
[1893.24s -> 1894.52s]  Why would you even be coming down here?
[1915.56s -> 1916.84s]  I have to kill him.
[1916.84s -> 1923.38s]  Just let him despawn.
[1923.38s -> 1924.26s]  Let him go all the way back.
[1927.16s -> 1927.88s]  Just go back.
[1936.26s -> 1937.46s]  This is the remastered version.
[1938.39s -> 1939.27s]  Lose you that of curious.
[1944.70s -> 1945.10s]  Got it.
[1945.10s -> 1945.74s]  Alright, I'm fine.
[1954.46s -> 1955.45s]  Alright, good.
[1959.56s -> 1960.12s]  What?
[1960.12s -> 1960.36s]  Who?
[1963.37s -> 1964.25s]  I don't know what that was.
[1964.25s -> 1965.37s]  I don't know what's in the wall.
[1968.06s -> 1969.74s]  It's a giant rat.
[1972.31s -> 1972.63s]  I got...
[1976.31s -> 1977.11s]  No, dude.
[1977.11s -> 1977.83s]  You can't.
[1978.55s -> 1979.35s]  You can't.
[1979.35s -> 1980.39s]  This is just...
[1980.39s -> 1981.67s]  This is comedy only.
[1981.67s -> 1983.43s]  Because how am I gonna be able to fight Yhorm?
[1984.31s -> 1985.19s]  Whatever his name is.
[1988.73s -> 1989.53s]  This is...
[1989.53s -> 1989.77s]  That...
[1989.77s -> 1990.49s]  It's in the way.
[1992.60s -> 1993.40s]  Oh, god.
[2000.65s -> 2001.93s]  Okay, I'm good.
[2001.93s -> 2002.33s]  I gotta go...
[2006.23s -> 2007.19s]  Just get to the bonfire.
[2017.14s -> 2018.10s]  I'm gonna go get him.
[2018.10s -> 2019.06s]  It's my turn now.
[2019.70s -> 2021.30s]  I just wish he's blobbing in the way.
[2023.32s -> 2024.20s]  I can't get by this.
[2029.96s -> 2030.60s]  Is there a sec...
[2030.60s -> 2031.72s]  Is there another way I can go?
[2033.00s -> 2034.52s]  Can I jump off the fucking side?
[2038.78s -> 2040.22s]  Oh, how did you get by?
[2040.22s -> 2040.46s]  What?
[2040.46s -> 2041.58s]  How did the fat guy get by?
[2047.03s -> 2047.67s]  Relentless.
[2048.23s -> 2049.43s]  They're fucking relentless.
[2050.07s -> 2050.39s]  Alright.
[2051.80s -> 2052.12s]  I'm gonna...
[2053.96s -> 2055.16s]  I think I can run around.
[2055.16s -> 2056.44s]  I'm gonna try to run around them.
[2056.44s -> 2063.96s]  I'm pretty sure I can get around that phalanx thing.
[2063.96s -> 2064.52s]  Whatever it is.
[2072.68s -> 2074.28s]  Just go up to the catacombs.
[2074.28s -> 2075.56s]  You know, that's not a bad idea.
[2077.82s -> 2078.62s]  I could also hold on.
[2078.62s -> 2079.74s]  I could also go down too.
[2079.74s -> 2080.30s]  Hold on.
[2080.30s -> 2080.86s]  Wait a minute.
[2081.34s -> 2083.66s]  Let me go through the graveyard.
[2095.85s -> 2096.65s]  Is he gonna die?
[2097.53s -> 2105.19s]  Alright.
[2105.19s -> 2106.47s]  Can I go up here?
[2107.03s -> 2108.65s]  I'm trying to remember Dark Souls.
[2108.65s -> 2109.45s]  I remember this guy.
[2109.45s -> 2110.01s]  And then I remember...
[2110.65s -> 2111.45s]  There's an elevator up here.
[2111.45s -> 2112.17s]  So I can't do this yet.
[2112.17s -> 2112.73s]  I don't think, right?
[2120.26s -> 2121.78s]  No, I need to activate the elevator.
[2122.66s -> 2123.30s]  Check for the items.
[2123.30s -> 2123.54s]  Oh, yeah.
[2123.54s -> 2123.78s]  That's right.
[2123.78s -> 2124.74s]  There's items and shit.
[2128.94s -> 2130.46s]  Well, that's Astora's straight sword.
[2130.46s -> 2131.74s]  Isn't that thing one of the best...
[2131.74s -> 2134.38s]  That's one of the best short swords in the game, isn't it?
[2140.86s -> 2142.07s]  Well, I'm gonna work towards that.
[2146.39s -> 2147.51s]  I'll keep on the hammer for now.
[2148.47s -> 2148.79s]  Alright.
[2148.79s -> 2149.99s]  Now I can go down.
[2149.99s -> 2150.39s]  What's the thing?
[2150.39s -> 2150.71s]  Where is he?
[2150.71s -> 2151.35s]  You can go down.
[2152.31s -> 2153.98s]  There's like a...
[2153.98s -> 2155.26s]  There's a couple of chests, right?
[2155.26s -> 2155.66s]  Over here.
[2158.62s -> 2159.98s]  It's not good in Dark Souls 1.
[2172.52s -> 2173.56s]  Guardian soul.
[2177.48s -> 2179.16s]  And the hammer of Vamos.
[2183.75s -> 2184.63s]  Really?
[2184.63s -> 2184.95s]  Really?
[2185.59s -> 2189.08s]  Should I just get fucking like 20,000 souls?
[2189.88s -> 2193.59s]  Let me see that hammer.
[2201.35s -> 2202.63s]  C scaling and strength.
[2203.43s -> 2207.19s]  And it's a one-handed hammer.
[2207.19s -> 2207.99s]  So this is better.
[2214.22s -> 2214.70s]  Is it worse?
[2215.34s -> 2216.70s]  With better strength though, wouldn't it be?
[2217.34s -> 2220.55s]  Oh, what?
[2221.83s -> 2222.23s]  You're right.
[2222.23s -> 2222.71s]  It is worse.
[2231.70s -> 2234.26s]  Dark hand and crystal greatsword.
[2234.98s -> 2237.56s]  This is so overwhelming.
[2238.12s -> 2245.74s]  Should I just use the crystal greatsword?
[2245.74s -> 2246.86s]  That doesn't break, don't they?
[2252.22s -> 2252.94s]  Dark hand?
[2260.28s -> 2261.08s]  What?
[2261.08s -> 2269.32s]  This is 200 damage?
[2269.88s -> 2270.84s]  I'm gonna try it.
[2271.48s -> 2276.09s]  I didn't want this in my chest, right?
[2276.09s -> 2276.65s]  No.
[2276.65s -> 2279.85s]  There's one over here.
[2280.57s -> 2283.83s]  Well, there it is, guys.
[2284.39s -> 2285.18s]  There it is.
[2285.98s -> 2286.78s]  You got what you wanted.
[2287.34s -> 2301.14s]  Come on, get it.
[2302.50s -> 2312.71s]  Oh, I don't know if I want to use this thing.
[2312.95s -> 2313.99s]  I need to parry you.
[2313.99s -> 2323.50s]  That's it?
[2323.50s -> 2324.14s]  25?
[2324.14s -> 2325.18s]  No, no, no, no.
[2325.18s -> 2325.98s]  He's dead.
[2325.98s -> 2326.70s]  The dark hand.
[2326.70s -> 2328.22s]  This thing's actually pretty good for a parry.
[2328.86s -> 2330.04s]  I'm gonna drop.
[2330.68s -> 2335.18s]  Why does he not do anything?
[2335.18s -> 2339.94s]  I'm still confused at what that does.
[2347.32s -> 2349.32s]  Why is there a house cat over here?
[2349.32s -> 2354.58s]  Is that just a scaled up house cat?
[2362.66s -> 2363.86s]  Oh my god.
[2363.86s -> 2364.98s]  That was fucking scary.
[2367.80s -> 2369.00s]  It's just dogs and cats.
[2369.00s -> 2369.80s]  They don't even attack.
[2370.36s -> 2372.60s]  He's not even gonna attack.
[2373.74s -> 2375.98s]  Don't even tell me he's gonna throw that ball.
[2375.98s -> 2378.84s]  What is he doing?
[2379.80s -> 2383.29s]  He's just placing balls.
[2383.29s -> 2384.33s]  Is there a hole?
[2384.33s -> 2385.61s]  I don't see a hole there.
[2393.14s -> 2395.18s]  He's just dropping them.
[2409.59s -> 2410.39s]  Don't hurt the cat.
[2410.39s -> 2411.35s]  You said free souls.
[2421.91s -> 2422.63s]  What?
[2422.63s -> 2423.67s]  I need the soul.
[2423.67s -> 2424.23s]  All right, fine.
[2427.83s -> 2429.51s]  Look, I'll cast an energy spell to heal.
[2429.51s -> 2431.03s]  I'll get this role playing heal spell.
[2441.08s -> 2442.81s]  What?
[2442.81s -> 2445.50s]  Hey, easy.
[2446.90s -> 2447.38s]  Easy.
[2447.38s -> 2464.79s]  Slow down.
[2464.79s -> 2466.15s]  Go this way.
[2466.15s -> 2470.30s]  Move this way.
[2470.30s -> 2471.02s]  No, move.
[2495.61s -> 2496.41s]  Is that an NPC?
[2505.50s -> 2509.82s]  Oh, it's a painted guardian, right?
[2510.54s -> 2520.14s]  What is sprinting over here?
[2520.14s -> 2520.70s]  It's one of...
[2522.17s -> 2522.57s]  I'm back.
[2522.57s -> 2523.53s]  It's me, the kitty.
[2524.09s -> 2527.10s]  Oh shit.
[2527.10s -> 2527.82s]  He's getting closer.
[2527.82s -> 2528.38s]  He's getting closer.
[2528.38s -> 2528.86s]  He's getting closer.
[2528.86s -> 2529.26s]  I gotta move.
[2529.98s -> 2535.85s]  Can this not...
[2535.85s -> 2536.81s]  I can't hurt this, right?
[2538.52s -> 2538.84s]  Listen.
[2539.66s -> 2541.50s]  Oh, that's what that sound is.
[2541.50s -> 2541.82s]  All right.
[2542.54s -> 2543.50s]  I need to get in there though.
[2544.06s -> 2557.43s]  This is so dumb.
[2558.82s -> 2559.14s]  Okay.
[2560.12s -> 2561.96s]  So I got dingy gloves.
[2562.68s -> 2564.92s]  Purple moss clump.
[2566.33s -> 2567.13s]  Really?
[2574.42s -> 2575.30s]  I can't really help you.
[2575.30s -> 2576.74s]  You're locked in here.
[2576.74s -> 2577.94s]  There's nowhere for you to really go.
[2580.39s -> 2582.55s]  Don't push me off the fucking edge, you punk.
[2583.27s -> 2584.55s]  If one of us is going, it's going to be you.
[2586.94s -> 2587.44s]  Oh.
[2589.77s -> 2590.09s]  Move.
[2590.09s -> 2590.89s]  Just fall off.
[2603.86s -> 2604.66s]  Move.
[2604.66s -> 2607.96s]  It's not going to move.
[2607.96s -> 2608.44s]  There it goes.
[2609.00s -> 2617.69s]  I actually can't get out of here.
[2620.17s -> 2632.62s]  No, there we go.
[2632.62s -> 2633.26s]  Okay.
[2633.26s -> 2634.06s]  Now let's...
[2634.06s -> 2634.62s]  Don't...
[2634.62s -> 2635.58s]  Did you even think about it?
[2635.58s -> 2636.08s]  Okay.
[2636.62s -> 2638.70s]  I want to go investigate the guy dropping the rocks.
[2640.10s -> 2641.14s]  This is really important.
[2653.61s -> 2654.49s]  Wait, I can't pick up the...
[2656.44s -> 2657.08s]  Does he fight?
[2657.08s -> 2658.12s]  I thought he just drops rocks.
[2658.68s -> 2672.70s]  I don't think he fights.
[2672.70s -> 2675.10s]  I think his AI is only to pick up and drop rocks.
[2675.10s -> 2675.66s]  Free souls.
[2688.50s -> 2689.30s]  He's friendly.
[2689.30s -> 2689.86s]  Sorry.
[2689.86s -> 2691.70s]  He was doing the equivalent of gardening.
[2691.70s -> 2693.38s]  But that's like 10,000 souls.
[2695.61s -> 2696.41s]  Yeah, that's a lot.
[2696.41s -> 2697.53s]  Red titanite chunk too.
[2698.33s -> 2704.83s]  Shit.
[2708.57s -> 2709.85s]  Is it two black knights?
[2714.41s -> 2715.45s]  I got to go level up.
[2717.67s -> 2718.63s]  Just take the items and run.
[2719.27s -> 2721.77s]  Oh, just get one.
[2721.77s -> 2722.49s]  Just get one.
[2722.49s -> 2723.21s]  I'm not going to...
[2723.21s -> 2723.69s]  I won't live.
[2724.41s -> 2731.99s]  This is the Uchi Katana.
[2738.57s -> 2739.21s]  No, not worth it.
[2739.21s -> 2739.45s]  Go.
[2739.45s -> 2739.95s]  Get out.
[2740.35s -> 2747.74s]  All right.
[2747.74s -> 2748.38s]  Time to level up.
[2751.80s -> 2752.60s]  I could go down.
[2752.60s -> 2753.40s]  No, it's too risky.
[2753.96s -> 2755.48s]  I have 10,000 souls.
[2755.48s -> 2760.36s]  I'll kill the...
[2760.36s -> 2761.16s]  I could...
[2761.16s -> 2761.56s]  Hold on.
[2762.12s -> 2764.46s]  Let me take care of this.
[2765.10s -> 2771.48s]  It's that one person said no balls and I had to prove them wrong.
[2772.12s -> 2784.88s]  What did he just throw out of me?
[2785.44s -> 2794.94s]  No item?
[2794.94s -> 2800.25s]  This guy's gonna take a lot more.
[2800.25s -> 2807.16s]  He's got a big mind up.
[2807.16s -> 2823.23s]  This is gonna take a while.
[2823.23s -> 2824.03s]  Leave him alone.
[2824.03s -> 2825.23s]  Well, he's attacking me.
[2825.23s -> 2826.03s]  He's trying to kill me.
[2838.84s -> 2839.72s]  I'm gonna get killed.
[2843.87s -> 2844.19s]  Dammit.
[2844.19s -> 2845.39s]  I thought I could get the third one.
[2845.95s -> 2856.00s]  Oh god.
[2856.00s -> 2856.64s]  Fuck him.
[2856.64s -> 2857.28s]  I don't even care.
[2857.28s -> 2857.78s]  Fuck him.
[2858.34s -> 2859.22s]  No, he's almost halfway.
[2859.22s -> 2859.86s]  He's gonna hit him once.
[2872.38s -> 2872.62s]  Got it.
[2872.62s -> 2873.34s]  All right.
[2873.34s -> 2876.05s]  That guy sucked.
[2876.05s -> 2876.77s]  No items.
[2876.77s -> 2877.01s]  Why?
[2877.81s -> 2878.53s]  I need items.
[2884.85s -> 2885.41s]  Now leave.
[2885.41s -> 2886.29s]  Not yet.
[2886.29s -> 2889.95s]  I want to get to a boss.
[2889.95s -> 2890.99s]  The closest boss is the...
[2891.55s -> 2892.75s]  The Taurus Demon.
[2893.39s -> 2904.96s]  Now there's a bonfire down there but I ain't gonna do it.
[2904.96s -> 2905.76s]  Just pinwheel.
[2908.74s -> 2908.98s]  Yeah.
[2908.98s -> 2910.98s]  I'm just gonna level up and I'm gonna go get Taurus Demon.
[2915.89s -> 2916.53s]  That's safe.
[2916.53s -> 2917.81s]  That's a safe play.
[2917.81s -> 2918.21s]  You're right.
[2923.18s -> 2925.02s]  Guys, it's not even gonna be pinwheel.
[2925.02s -> 2925.82s]  Don't you understand?
[2925.82s -> 2927.02s]  It's gonna be a different person.
[2933.22s -> 2934.26s]  Yeah, I am afraid of pinwheel
[2934.26s -> 2937.06s]  because he's gonna get randomly rolled into like three Gwyns.
[2937.70s -> 2943.65s]  Painted cardian robes.
[2943.65s -> 2946.48s]  Let's go.
[2946.48s -> 2952.72s]  It's so funny how it just starts hanging.
[2952.72s -> 2983.33s]  Use the docket.
[2984.05s -> 2989.84s]  Well, now you have to die.
[2990.64s -> 2998.21s]  They take up so much space.
[2998.21s -> 3002.70s]  What should I even be stacking here?
[3002.70s -> 3003.26s]  Just health?
[3003.90s -> 3008.99s]  All right.
[3008.99s -> 3010.11s]  Let's get some more endurance.
[3010.75s -> 3013.44s]  Just a shitload of strength.
[3014.08s -> 3016.56s]  More.
[3016.56s -> 3028.58s]  Okay.
[3030.08s -> 3030.48s]  I'm going.
[3030.48s -> 3030.80s]  Here we go.
[3033.28s -> 3034.00s]  More.
[3034.00s -> 3038.21s]  I'm gonna get to Taurus Demon.
[3038.21s -> 3042.93s]  I need...
[3042.93s -> 3043.33s]  You know what?
[3043.33s -> 3045.97s]  Actually, 20-20 hindsight here.
[3045.97s -> 3047.41s]  I should stack in here.
[3047.41s -> 3051.42s]  I think I got punched in the back of the head
[3051.42s -> 3053.26s]  and it severed my spinal cord.
[3053.26s -> 3057.02s]  It's all right.
[3057.02s -> 3057.82s]  I'm fine with dying here.
[3059.31s -> 3060.11s]  Use the soul?
[3061.62s -> 3062.26s]  Yeah, I can.
[3062.26s -> 3062.66s]  I could.
[3062.66s -> 3063.38s]  Just use the...
[3063.38s -> 3063.78s]  You're right.
[3063.78s -> 3064.02s]  Yeah.
[3066.40s -> 3069.28s]  Use the guardian soul and get 12,000.
[3069.28s -> 3070.08s]  Sounds pretty good.
[3085.63s -> 3087.15s]  He leveled 23 already.
[3094.40s -> 3096.50s]  Didn't mean to do that.
[3096.50s -> 3097.38s]  I have another one.
[3097.38s -> 3097.94s]  It's all right.
[3098.58s -> 3100.74s]  Now I shouldn't just take a punch in the back of the head and die.
[3101.89s -> 3103.89s]  I need to get to the first fucking boss first
[3103.89s -> 3104.85s]  before we do anything else.
[3109.02s -> 3109.74s]  Well, I'm dead here.
[3110.30s -> 3124.22s]  I just jumped into that.
[3124.22s -> 3130.88s]  Oh, god damn it.
[3130.88s -> 3134.56s]  I'll be happy if I get past the first boss.
[3135.68s -> 3137.04s]  I wonder if I can randomize...
[3137.04s -> 3138.64s]  Is anybody familiar with this mod?
[3139.81s -> 3142.45s]  Know that if I can just turn the game off
[3142.45s -> 3144.53s]  and randomize it and play this game again,
[3145.41s -> 3147.47s]  do I have to skip?
[3148.11s -> 3149.63s]  Oh, and do I have to reload a new game?
[3150.35s -> 3152.42s]  Or does it just do it no matter what?
[3152.42s -> 3153.54s]  Okay, that's cool.
[3157.12s -> 3159.60s]  I just have to get to the bonfire.
[3160.24s -> 3162.61s]  Unless you change the seed, it's fine.
[3162.61s -> 3163.17s]  All right, that's cool.
[3170.34s -> 3173.73s]  Just a humanity in a randomized land.
[3174.61s -> 3175.41s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[3175.97s -> 3178.32s]  Oh, the rat, right?
[3178.32s -> 3184.43s]  All right, let's try this again.
[3184.99s -> 3185.87s]  I'm gonna get topped off
[3186.59s -> 3189.63s]  and I'm gonna go on the right side.
[3190.59s -> 3193.28s]  Holy shit.
[3193.28s -> 3194.16s]  I didn't even pick anything up.
[3194.88s -> 3196.88s]  I got hit so hard, I got an item out of me.
[3197.44s -> 3198.64s]  I dropped a loot for that guy.
[3199.44s -> 3214.45s]  You guys, come on.
[3215.09s -> 3216.03s]  Wait, he moved.
[3216.75s -> 3219.81s]  I don't know what triggered the move, but he moved.
[3224.14s -> 3225.26s]  I don't even know why I opened that door.
[3226.94s -> 3228.14s]  No, no, get out of the way.
[3231.68s -> 3232.64s]  Get out of the way.
[3233.52s -> 3235.12s]  No, please.
[3239.15s -> 3241.15s]  Oh, I can't touch it because they're in here.
[3241.15s -> 3253.55s]  I gotta get all these people.
[3265.02s -> 3266.06s]  No, fuck.
[3266.06s -> 3271.54s]  I got tripped up on the pot on the ground.
[3272.10s -> 3278.90s]  I'll get up there.
[3279.62s -> 3283.68s]  It was the stupid armor dog that blew that whole thing.
[3284.40s -> 3296.03s]  Thank you.
[3296.03s -> 3297.23s]  That was a pretty good jump you just did.
[3297.23s -> 3297.79s]  You just saved me.
[3298.43s -> 3304.64s]  Move arrow.
[3305.20s -> 3309.54s]  Is it time for me to puke?
[3309.54s -> 3310.10s]  No, not yet.
[3310.82s -> 3311.63s]  I'm doing all right.
[3316.58s -> 3318.34s]  The same shit's gonna happen again.
[3318.34s -> 3319.14s]  He's gonna be in the way.
[3324.74s -> 3329.38s]  I'm gonna have to try to shove the hammer.
[3338.72s -> 3342.30s]  Why?
[3344.43s -> 3348.14s]  I just alley-ooped myself onto his lance.
[3354.03s -> 3357.36s]  I might have to go down to the crypts.
[3358.08s -> 3372.35s]  I'll get stuck down there.
[3372.35s -> 3374.11s]  Yeah, but at least I might make a little bit of progress.
[3388.82s -> 3390.10s]  What if I just go down?
[3390.10s -> 3391.62s]  No, I have to eventually get up here.
[3392.18s -> 3397.60s]  All right, here we go.
[3399.36s -> 3403.76s]  I need to go right this way.
[3407.25s -> 3408.05s]  What?
[3409.44s -> 3412.46s]  Wow, what does it make any sense?
[3413.26s -> 3415.18s]  He hit me with the backswing.
[3415.18s -> 3418.22s]  I was the catcher behind him and he swung too hard and hit me.
[3418.22s -> 3418.94s]  Oh, come on.
[3419.50s -> 3434.13s]  I'll get it.
[3436.74s -> 3437.78s]  Look, this is the hard part.
[3437.78s -> 3442.34s]  The easy part is when the boss gets re-rolled as this pinwheel five times.
[3443.14s -> 3445.25s]  I'll laugh my ass off.
[3445.25s -> 3445.97s]  I'm not gonna get hit by it.
[3445.97s -> 3447.01s]  Not gonna get hit by it.
[3447.01s -> 3447.49s]  Ready?
[3447.49s -> 3448.45s]  One, two, three.
[3449.41s -> 3450.06s]  Told you.
[3451.22s -> 3451.78s]  All right.
[3451.78s -> 3452.66s]  I have the right idea.
[3456.94s -> 3457.34s]  Comes.
[3457.98s -> 3460.13s]  Get through.
[3460.77s -> 3463.04s]  Watch out.
[3463.04s -> 3464.40s]  I'm not gonna get hit by this.
[3464.40s -> 3464.88s]  Told you.
[3465.94s -> 3466.50s]  To the right.
[3467.06s -> 3475.63s]  I get stuck on the thing somehow.
[3476.43s -> 3478.85s]  In a second, I'm gonna have to wait for him to come over here.
[3478.85s -> 3479.33s]  Yeah, all right.
[3479.33s -> 3481.33s]  When he gets down here, I'm going, I gotta wrap around.
[3482.85s -> 3483.81s]  One, two, three.
[3484.53s -> 3495.71s]  Okay.
[3495.71s -> 3497.23s]  This is actually not terrible.
[3497.23s -> 3502.21s]  I'm invincible.
[3502.21s -> 3503.01s]  This is perfect.
[3503.01s -> 3503.51s]  Perfect.
[3510.77s -> 3512.05s]  Not perfect.
[3512.05s -> 3512.77s]  Very bad.
[3523.74s -> 3524.46s]  One v one.
[3529.15s -> 3529.87s]  All right.
[3529.87s -> 3531.79s]  This is the best attempt I'm gonna have here so far.
[3532.67s -> 3536.86s]  What does this thing do?
[3536.86s -> 3540.56s]  Does it just moan?
[3540.56s -> 3541.28s]  Or does it do anything?
[3541.28s -> 3542.24s]  I don't remember this enemy.
[3543.04s -> 3549.01s]  He tried.
[3549.01s -> 3549.97s]  Do you see that?
[3549.97s -> 3552.45s]  He tried to just lance me from all the way up.
[3552.45s -> 3552.69s]  All right.
[3552.69s -> 3553.89s]  He has a tongue that comes out.
[3554.77s -> 3557.31s]  He's not gonna be able to hit me with it.
[3557.31s -> 3557.79s]  I'm too tall.
[3557.79s -> 3558.67s]  I'm too short.
[3558.67s -> 3558.91s]  Yeah.
[3558.91s -> 3559.23s]  Okay.
[3559.23s -> 3559.71s]  I'm gonna be...
[3560.91s -> 3568.42s]  I'm just gonna stand here.
[3568.42s -> 3569.70s]  I'm way too small.
[3569.70s -> 3579.74s]  That guy's so desperate.
[3579.74s -> 3580.62s]  I have to get rid of him too.
[3580.62s -> 3581.02s]  No, I don't.
[3581.02s -> 3582.38s]  I just have to make it up there.
[3582.38s -> 3583.98s]  I think I should probably kill this thing though.
[3584.70s -> 3603.30s]  He's gonna be able to come down.
[3603.30s -> 3603.54s]  All right.
[3603.54s -> 3603.86s]  Drink.
[3604.50s -> 3607.95s]  Oh, the Estus ship.
[3608.59s -> 3614.42s]  I'm not gonna do it.
[3614.42s -> 3614.90s]  I'm gonna run.
[3620.19s -> 3625.47s]  All right.
[3625.47s -> 3625.79s]  Out of the way.
[3625.79s -> 3626.11s]  Out of the way.
[3626.11s -> 3627.07s]  Out of the way.
[3627.07s -> 3627.87s]  Out of the way please.
[3627.87s -> 3628.59s]  Out of the way.
[3628.59s -> 3629.07s]  Out of the way.
[3629.07s -> 3629.47s]  Out of the way.
[3629.47s -> 3629.79s]  Oh my god.
[3629.79s -> 3630.43s]  Please get out of the way.
[3631.39s -> 3631.87s]  Oh my god.
[3632.51s -> 3633.30s]  Where is he?
[3647.65s -> 3648.21s]  Just kill it.
[3648.21s -> 3649.97s]  I thought he was gonna keep moving backwards.
[3650.61s -> 3651.65s]  How hard is it to kill this?
[3652.53s -> 3653.01s]  Find out.
[3653.57s -> 3657.90s]  I don't know.
[3657.90s -> 3659.26s]  I'm not gonna fight it.
[3661.63s -> 3662.67s]  I'm gonna run and hit the boar
[3662.67s -> 3663.79s]  and then keep running around in a circle.
[3671.98s -> 3672.54s]  Do it.
[3672.54s -> 3672.86s]  Do it.
[3672.86s -> 3673.10s]  Do it.
[3673.10s -> 3674.86s]  Do it.
[3674.86s -> 3675.42s]  Sit down.
[3675.42s -> 3675.98s]  Sit down.
[3675.98s -> 3676.46s]  Sit down.
[3693.89s -> 3694.77s]  I'm good.
[3694.77s -> 3705.70s]  So, uh, next step is to keep going
[3705.70s -> 3706.98s]  and to go kill the Taurus demon.
[3707.62s -> 3709.23s]  I'm gonna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3709.23s -> 3715.60s]  Use this.
[3715.60s -> 3719.17s]  Congratulations.
[3719.17s -> 3720.45s]  You made it through the first bonfire.
[3720.45s -> 3721.17s]  Yeah, I know, right?
[3722.29s -> 3724.59s]  I want more health and endurance.
[3725.39s -> 3730.27s]  Is my plan to keep not killing things?
[3730.27s -> 3731.31s]  I just killed a bunch of things.
[3732.19s -> 3737.31s]  I mean, it's kind of hard with what they're these.
[3737.95s -> 3751.38s]  All right.
[3751.38s -> 3752.58s]  Yeah, you're gonna put another one
[3752.58s -> 3753.78s]  of those right in front of there.
[3754.74s -> 3755.54s]  But this is hell.
[3756.10s -> 3757.14s]  This is actually hell.
[3757.14s -> 3758.50s]  I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[3758.50s -> 3759.78s]  This is fucking over.
[3759.78s -> 3760.82s]  Are you serious?
[3773.12s -> 3774.37s]  Hi, guys.
[3781.09s -> 3786.72s]  I could jump off, right?
[3786.72s -> 3788.13s]  It's these boars.
[3788.13s -> 3789.41s]  The boars are just blocking the path
[3789.41s -> 3790.53s]  and making it impossible.
[3791.34s -> 3792.30s]  I think I could get in there.
[3792.94s -> 3793.82s]  Let me try to jump down.
[3797.31s -> 3797.95s]  Wait, hold on.
[3798.59s -> 3800.88s]  Let me see if I can just.
[3801.52s -> 3803.18s]  As long as I get in.
[3803.18s -> 3803.74s]  All right, I'm in.
[3819.28s -> 3821.12s]  I don't even know where the dog came from.
[3825.39s -> 3827.15s]  It's like Minecraft.
[3827.15s -> 3828.75s]  Yeah, it is kind of like Minecraft.
[3830.05s -> 3830.37s]  When you.
[3844.61s -> 3846.86s]  Oh, my God.
[3846.86s -> 3847.50s]  Just climb up.
[3848.22s -> 3849.17s]  They can't get up.
[3860.43s -> 3860.91s]  Damn it.
[3863.63s -> 3864.19s]  I have to.
[3864.19s -> 3865.95s]  I have to kill them one by one.
[3865.95s -> 3867.07s]  That's the only way this is gonna happen.
[3867.07s -> 3867.47s]  Let's go.
[3868.43s -> 3869.15s]  Like that one.
[3877.18s -> 3877.50s]  Okay.
[3878.14s -> 3879.52s]  What are you doing?
[3879.52s -> 3880.40s]  Did you walk up here?
[3882.56s -> 3883.68s]  I hear something moving.
[3883.68s -> 3884.16s]  It's that.
[3884.16s -> 3884.48s]  I don't.
[3885.20s -> 3886.32s]  I have to take care of this thing.
[3889.66s -> 3890.62s]  Oh, you dick.
[3896.02s -> 3904.80s]  No, I'm gonna jump off.
[3910.80s -> 3911.36s]  Where's the jump?
[3912.00s -> 3914.30s]  Is it at the end of the bridge?
[3929.76s -> 3938.14s]  All right, I know where it is.
[3938.14s -> 3938.30s]  Yeah.
[3938.30s -> 3938.46s]  Okay.
[3957.33s -> 3959.89s]  Go's armor and bellowing dragon crest ring.
[3967.42s -> 3969.87s]  Are they going all the way around?
[3970.67s -> 3971.07s]  All of them.
[3971.71s -> 3974.53s]  That's how Dark Souls works, right?
[3974.53s -> 3986.37s]  Sorry, it's gonna take them a long time to get here.
[3986.37s -> 3987.25s]  Is there any items over here?
[3998.22s -> 3999.58s]  Do I hear a cookie bug?
[3999.58s -> 4000.06s]  All right.
[4000.06s -> 4001.26s]  It's just one of these little idiots.
[4002.45s -> 4003.41s]  Oh, you fell down.
[4003.41s -> 4003.81s]  Stupid.
[4004.61s -> 4008.24s]  Not as tough as your mother.
[4008.24s -> 4008.64s]  Are you?
[4010.59s -> 4012.27s]  Cyanide just gave 20 community subs.
[4013.95s -> 4017.23s]  Thank you, Cyanide, for your 20 community subs.
[4018.03s -> 4022.94s]  That's a shitload of money.
[4022.94s -> 4023.26s]  Thank you.
[4024.77s -> 4027.01s]  At some point, I gotta make a move here.
[4027.01s -> 4028.37s]  And I'm not gonna go for that chest right now.
[4028.37s -> 4029.01s]  I'll get it later.
[4029.81s -> 4031.70s]  This...
[4031.70s -> 4032.50s]  Oh, god, there's nobody.
[4033.06s -> 4033.86s]  There was nobody up there.
[4035.10s -> 4035.66s]  Oh, no.
[4035.66s -> 4035.98s]  Okay.
[4046.24s -> 4047.68s]  I'm kind of panicking.
[4047.68s -> 4049.20s]  I just gotta get up there to get to the...
[4049.20s -> 4050.24s]  Get to the Taurus Demon.
[4051.65s -> 4052.45s]  Taurus Demon, go.
[4057.38s -> 4058.74s]  That is not the Taurus Demon.
[4059.30s -> 4059.94s]  That...
[4059.94s -> 4060.82s]  I think...
[4060.82s -> 4062.74s]  I think he's just gonna fall off the edge.
[4063.46s -> 4064.29s]  Hello?
[4064.85s -> 4069.60s]  Wait a minute.
[4069.60s -> 4070.72s]  This is important.
[4070.72s -> 4076.61s]  The gaping dragon cannot fit up here.
[4076.61s -> 4077.73s]  These guys don't do anything, right?
[4077.73s -> 4078.13s]  They can't.
[4078.69s -> 4084.16s]  They're just spectators.
[4084.80s -> 4087.10s]  All right.
[4088.88s -> 4099.78s]  Good luck.
[4099.78s -> 4100.74s]  Is he gonna aggro?
[4106.62s -> 4109.41s]  He takes up the whole bridge.
[4110.37s -> 4112.69s]  If he goes down, he's gonna be on the whole bridge.
[4112.69s -> 4113.57s]  I can't do this.
[4114.37s -> 4129.07s]  Oh, he's on the...
[4129.07s -> 4130.67s]  His tin box is so big right here.
[4131.47s -> 4135.57s]  Is he aggro?
[4140.83s -> 4141.39s]  No!
[4141.39s -> 4141.63s]  No!
[4142.99s -> 4144.43s]  No, he's gonna run, isn't he?
[4144.43s -> 4145.31s]  He runs, right?
[4146.83s -> 4148.19s]  I don't fucking remember.
[4162.16s -> 4165.26s]  Oh, shit.
[4165.98s -> 4176.38s]  Did he...
[4176.38s -> 4177.34s]  Did he go down?
[4177.34s -> 4177.98s]  Is he gonna run?
[4178.86s -> 4180.03s]  Oh, god.
[4180.59s -> 4181.23s]  Oh, no.
[4181.23s -> 4181.63s]  I'm dead.
[4195.09s -> 4195.41s]  Oh!
[4196.13s -> 4200.96s]  Do I have anything...
[4200.96s -> 4201.84s]  I'm gonna take a humanity.
[4202.56s -> 4203.44s]  Should I take a humanity?
[4204.24s -> 4206.93s]  Oh, god.
[4206.93s -> 4207.41s]  He's gonna run.
[4208.29s -> 4209.33s]  I am fucked.
[4209.33s -> 4209.81s]  I'm fucked.
[4209.81s -> 4210.21s]  I'm fucked.
[4210.21s -> 4210.53s]  I'm fucked.
[4210.53s -> 4210.77s]  I'm fucked.
[4210.77s -> 4211.09s]  I'm fucked.
[4211.09s -> 4211.41s]  I'm fucked.
[4211.41s -> 4211.65s]  I'm fucked.
[4211.65s -> 4211.97s]  I'm fucked.
[4211.97s -> 4212.29s]  I'm fucked.
[4212.29s -> 4212.61s]  I'm fucked.
[4212.61s -> 4213.01s]  I'm fucked.
[4213.01s -> 4213.89s]  I'm fucked.
[4213.89s -> 4214.37s]  I'm fucked.
[4215.25s -> 4215.81s]  I'm fucked.
[4218.58s -> 4219.38s]  Wait.
[4219.38s -> 4219.94s]  What?
[4219.94s -> 4220.74s]  Climb the ladder!
[4221.38s -> 4224.24s]  How did you get down here?
[4243.49s -> 4243.81s]  Yeah!
[4244.53s -> 4254.86s]  Oh, fucking god damn it.
[4259.94s -> 4263.07s]  Oh, and there goes the humanity.
[4263.07s -> 4263.39s]  Shit!
[4264.11s -> 4266.43s]  And now I'm all the way back here.
[4270.85s -> 4271.49s]  That sucks.
[4272.13s -> 4280.18s]  I think I missed.
[4280.18s -> 4280.58s]  I did.
[4284.42s -> 4285.22s]  I'll get it this time.
[4285.22s -> 4286.50s]  I thought he was gonna fall off the edge.
[4287.22s -> 4294.98s]  I'll get it this time.
[4294.98s -> 4295.38s]  Don't worry.
[4295.38s -> 4295.86s]  I got this.
[4304.00s -> 4304.56s]  Let me be fair.
[4304.56s -> 4308.40s]  That's only like the third time I've ever actually done this jump in the five times
[4308.40s -> 4309.28s]  I've played through this game.
[4310.00s -> 4321.68s]  All right.
[4321.68s -> 4322.32s]  I'm not doing this right.
[4322.96s -> 4326.24s]  That's the sixth time I've attempted to do that jump in the five times I've played this game.
[4326.88s -> 4332.08s]  I didn't even know that existed until somebody told me to do it.
[4335.28s -> 4335.92s]  Just roll?
[4335.92s -> 4336.72s]  I thought I was supposed to jump.
[4337.44s -> 4342.74s]  I'm trying just to roll.
[4342.74s -> 4344.10s]  I'm trying to do it.
[4344.10s -> 4344.66s]  I can't do it.
[4345.30s -> 4366.98s]  How did I do this right the first two times?
[4367.54s -> 4373.54s]  I don't understand.
[4373.54s -> 4375.34s]  What am I doing different this time?
[4379.78s -> 4380.90s]  I don't understand what I'm doing different.
[4388.38s -> 4389.34s]  Fucking dicks.
[4389.34s -> 4390.54s]  Oh my god.
[4409.20s -> 4418.43s]  I have no idea why I can't do this.
[4418.43s -> 4418.99s]  Please stop.
[4418.99s -> 4420.59s]  I'm not doing this on purpose.
[4420.59s -> 4422.27s]  I'm trying to make the jump.
[4429.92s -> 4431.12s]  What is happening?
[4431.12s -> 4432.48s]  Why can't I do this?
[4441.23s -> 4443.39s]  My fucking god.
[4443.39s -> 4444.59s]  What am I doing wrong?
[4445.31s -> 4452.35s]  I'm about to turn the stream off.
[4453.49s -> 4453.89s]  I'm doing it.
[4453.89s -> 4455.01s]  I'm turning the stream off.
[4455.09s -> 4458.54s]  Gotta put my password in.
[4458.54s -> 4461.58s]  There it is.
[4461.58s -> 4462.30s]  Okay.
[4462.30s -> 4463.66s]  Countdown in about four or five hours.
[4463.66s -> 4464.54s]  The stream's gonna turn off.
[4467.01s -> 4467.57s]  I did it.
[4467.57s -> 4469.17s]  The countdown started in like six hours.
[4469.17s -> 4476.75s]  The stream's gonna turn off.
[4476.75s -> 4479.63s]  I, honest to god, have no fucking idea why I can't do this.
[4479.63s -> 4481.15s]  I did it like the first three times I tried it.
[4481.15s -> 4481.87s]  What am I doing wrong?
[4482.51s -> 4485.84s]  I'm just gonna run.
[4486.40s -> 4496.66s]  First of all, let me change the worst setting of any video game in history.
[4496.66s -> 4497.06s]  Hold on.
[4513.44s -> 4524.98s]  No, no.
[4524.98s -> 4527.86s]  No, what the fuck are you doing?
[4527.86s -> 4528.74s]  Oh, I am.
[4528.74s -> 4529.78s]  What is happening?
[4529.78s -> 4531.78s]  Just what the hell is going on?
[4533.25s -> 4534.69s]  It's because I'm using Switch.
[4537.41s -> 4538.85s]  Fuck you, game.
[4538.85s -> 4539.89s]  Unbelievable.
[4545.57s -> 4546.21s]  Back.
[4546.21s -> 4546.69s]  Save.
[4546.69s -> 4547.17s]  Changes.
[4547.17s -> 4547.41s]  Go.
[4548.21s -> 4561.74s]  Why is this?
[4561.74s -> 4562.54s]  Why can I not dab?
[4562.54s -> 4563.18s]  What?
[4563.18s -> 4564.02s]  Okay.
[4564.02s -> 4565.06s]  It's fixed.
[4565.06s -> 4565.38s]  It's fixed.
[4565.38s -> 4566.42s]  It's fixed.
[4566.42s -> 4568.21s]  I'm gonna try this last time.
[4568.85s -> 4578.26s]  I tried just to roll off.
[4578.26s -> 4578.66s]  I don't know.
[4578.66s -> 4579.38s]  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[4579.38s -> 4580.02s]  I don't understand.
[4580.02s -> 4581.30s]  I really don't get it.
[4581.30s -> 4584.35s]  I'm just gonna go the normal way before I fucking freak out.
[4587.55s -> 4589.15s]  I tried just to roll off.
[4589.15s -> 4590.99s]  No, I'm going the fucking way.
[4590.99s -> 4592.11s]  I'm not taking the shortcut.
[4592.11s -> 4592.51s]  Let's go.
[4596.16s -> 4596.64s]  I made it.
[4607.52s -> 4608.40s]  These enemies.
[4612.26s -> 4614.02s]  Those things are so horrible here.
[4626.94s -> 4628.06s]  I swear to God.
[4628.06s -> 4632.43s]  I seriously sucks.
[4635.76s -> 4636.96s]  This jump is easy.
[4636.96s -> 4641.23s]  I don't know what I'm doing incorrect.
[4641.23s -> 4644.19s]  And plus I have like this asshole up my ass the whole time.
[4644.19s -> 4645.15s]  I can't line it up.
[4651.39s -> 4652.03s]  Just walk?
[4658.18s -> 4659.06s]  Just walk off.
[4671.14s -> 4672.74s]  Why can't I do this?
[4673.46s -> 4674.34s]  Oh my God.
[4674.34s -> 4675.30s]  I'm seriously.
[4675.30s -> 4676.98s]  I'm fucking getting so pissed off from this.
[4677.70s -> 4683.98s]  This is making me madder than the whole eight and a half fucking hours
[4683.98s -> 4685.02s]  of Mario Maker last night.
[4688.06s -> 4689.34s]  I tried to press B.
[4709.87s -> 4711.23s]  No, I'm getting caught.
[4711.23s -> 4712.03s]  I'm just gonna run.
[4712.03s -> 4712.51s]  Oh my God.
[4712.51s -> 4713.71s]  I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[4713.71s -> 4714.67s]  I'm just gonna run.
[4714.67s -> 4727.30s]  I'm gonna fucking lose it.
[4727.30s -> 4734.02s]  I'm not doing it anymore.
[4734.02s -> 4741.15s]  Why is that the thing that's got me so caught in fucking A?
[4741.79s -> 4750.30s]  This is such a shit roll too.
[4750.30s -> 4752.70s]  I have like all these fucking DLC enemies.
[4777.23s -> 4780.02s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[4780.02s -> 4780.90s]  You did it.
[4780.90s -> 4782.18s]  Hey, you did it everybody.
[4782.18s -> 4783.30s]  Yeah, he's won.
[4783.30s -> 4784.82s]  I see you finally.
[4784.82s -> 4798.58s]  Why are you standing in the worst possible spot?
[4808.45s -> 4809.65s]  I couldn't fucking do it.
[4809.65s -> 4810.61s]  I promise.
[4810.61s -> 4811.89s]  I don't know what the hell is wrong.
[4811.89s -> 4812.69s]  I couldn't get it.
[4812.69s -> 4813.81s]  I tried.
[4813.81s -> 4815.41s]  All right, let's get the gaping dragon.
[4815.41s -> 4819.34s]  Thank you Pixel Mike for the five community subs.
[4819.34s -> 4820.78s]  I have to kill these guys up here
[4820.78s -> 4824.30s]  because last time the guy came down and caused a problem.
[4827.65s -> 4829.33s]  This guy made his way down somehow.
[4829.33s -> 4830.45s]  I don't know how the fuck he did it.
[4834.26s -> 4837.06s]  All right, if like shitty Ornstein and Smog kill me up here,
[4837.06s -> 4838.82s]  I'm gonna be so mad.
[4839.22s -> 4842.34s]  I'm gonna be so upset by this and I can already tell.
[4853.70s -> 4860.96s]  Why do you have so much health?
[4860.96s -> 4862.40s]  Is lightning resistant another problem?
[4869.65s -> 4871.65s]  All right, this is the attempt here.
[4871.65s -> 4873.17s]  I'm gonna try to just be careful.
[4875.09s -> 4875.97s]  I almost puked.
[4875.97s -> 4877.25s]  It was almost time to turn the stream off.
[4877.25s -> 4878.21s]  I seriously almost threw up.
[4885.28s -> 4889.62s]  All right, so let me put on something.
[4891.38s -> 4893.22s]  I'm not gonna put on like this dumb shit.
[4901.28s -> 4903.46s]  Am I still?
[4903.46s -> 4904.10s]  All right, what about?
[4904.82s -> 4917.23s]  I mean, it's a mid roll, but I don't want the mid roll.
[4917.95s -> 4922.37s]  Here we go.
[4922.37s -> 4939.33s]  Oh no, he really immediately.
[4940.53s -> 4942.88s]  Also, why do I keep jumping?
[4942.88s -> 4944.24s]  I thought I unbound that from B.
[4945.20s -> 4950.19s]  That's a hitbox still.
[4950.83s -> 4953.04s]  Cut the tail.
[4958.02s -> 4959.46s]  He's in such an awkward position.
[4960.10s -> 4967.62s]  Oh my God.
[4968.34s -> 4979.81s]  Don't do it.
[4979.81s -> 4980.29s]  Don't do it.
[4980.29s -> 4980.69s]  Don't do it.
[4980.69s -> 4981.09s]  Don't do it.
[4988.75s -> 4989.63s]  He's too big.
[4990.51s -> 5000.99s]  Oh my God.
[5006.61s -> 5007.49s]  He's gonna go forward.
[5008.45s -> 5009.81s]  Stop running.
[5009.81s -> 5010.53s]  Stop running, please.
[5011.76s -> 5012.56s]  Oh shit.
[5013.44s -> 5040.37s]  Anyways, that...
[5040.37s -> 5051.15s]  Okay, hold on.
[5051.15s -> 5054.93s]  I know, gaping dragon, I'm not gonna make fun of you
[5054.93s -> 5056.37s]  because I know how hard it is to make it
[5056.37s -> 5058.21s]  from there to the platform down there.
[5058.21s -> 5059.25s]  I'm not gonna make fun of you.
[5059.25s -> 5060.29s]  And I know you were very close
[5060.29s -> 5061.41s]  to just turning off your stream.
[5062.35s -> 5063.87s]  And I think you actually did turn it off
[5063.87s -> 5066.19s]  because you're not still live anymore.
[5070.56s -> 5072.90s]  Missed the item, did I?
[5072.90s -> 5076.08s]  All right, what do you guys think?
[5076.08s -> 5077.12s]  It's time for a roll.
[5077.12s -> 5077.84s]  You want to roll it?
[5092.03s -> 5093.55s]  Let's try to get to one more boss
[5093.55s -> 5094.51s]  and I'm gonna roll it.
[5094.51s -> 5129.95s]  I'm not gonna kill him.
[5129.95s -> 5131.30s]  Why do you think I'm gonna kill...
[5131.30s -> 5132.18s]  All right, is it gonna be the...
[5132.90s -> 5135.25s]  Will it be the dragon?
[5135.25s -> 5141.28s]  Or is it gonna be somebody else?
[5141.28s -> 5143.44s]  No, why do you have to be here?
[5145.10s -> 5146.54s]  Oh, come on.
[5146.54s -> 5150.37s]  This is like the fourth one of these guys.
[5161.04s -> 5162.00s]  I'm coming here too.
[5162.00s -> 5164.80s]  Me too.
[5164.80s -> 5165.76s]  Let's go get him.
[5165.76s -> 5176.32s]  Does he breathe the fire?
[5176.32s -> 5176.72s]  Where is he?
[5177.28s -> 5178.26s]  Where is he?
[5178.82s -> 5181.01s]  Where is he?
[5181.57s -> 5185.76s]  Where is he?
[5185.76s -> 5187.58s]  Is he just not here?
[5187.58s -> 5188.67s]  Oh, he's up there.
[5189.60s -> 5189.92s]  It's...
[5189.92s -> 5191.04s]  Is it a gargoyle?
[5191.04s -> 5192.16s]  He's just stuck up there.
[5199.50s -> 5200.46s]  No, he's still in here.
[5201.02s -> 5214.82s]  I gotta go back.
[5214.82s -> 5215.30s]  I gotta go back.
[5215.30s -> 5215.70s]  I gotta go back.
[5215.70s -> 5216.50s]  I gotta go to the shortcut.
[5217.70s -> 5219.94s]  I had to just escape through one zone somewhere.
[5219.94s -> 5220.42s]  Is he...
[5220.42s -> 5221.22s]  I see the shadow.
[5221.22s -> 5222.02s]  He's still following me.
[5223.68s -> 5224.48s]  Is that a shadow?
[5225.70s -> 5227.62s]  Oh, he's still following me.
[5228.26s -> 5230.21s]  He's gonna fall off the edge though, I think.
[5231.23s -> 5232.11s]  He can't fit up here.
[5232.91s -> 5234.91s]  There's just a bigger rat in here.
[5238.93s -> 5239.25s]  No.
[5244.02s -> 5245.70s]  I have to knock that shortcut down.
[5246.34s -> 5261.41s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[5261.41s -> 5262.13s]  We're good.
[5262.13s -> 5269.79s]  Slide down.
[5271.70s -> 5272.10s]  All right.
[5273.44s -> 5274.00s]  Good.
[5274.00s -> 5283.87s]  Are these random?
[5283.87s -> 5284.51s]  Are these random?
[5284.51s -> 5285.31s]  I didn't choose anything.
[5286.88s -> 5287.60s]  You can't choose.
[5295.30s -> 5295.78s]  Hold B?
[5295.78s -> 5296.02s]  That's...
[5296.02s -> 5297.22s]  I thought that that's what I was trying to do.
[5299.15s -> 5300.35s]  All right, let's go back.
[5300.35s -> 5302.03s]  Okay, let's see what happens when we get up there.
[5302.75s -> 5303.79s]  I'm not going that way.
[5303.79s -> 5304.43s]  I'm going up.
[5307.01s -> 5308.21s]  Is he actually gonna breathe fire?
[5308.77s -> 5309.65s]  I don't think he's gonna breathe fire.
[5309.65s -> 5310.53s]  He just stuck in the wall.
[5311.09s -> 5315.06s]  He's just a decoration.
[5317.28s -> 5318.16s]  Cleric armor?
[5326.11s -> 5326.43s]  Can I...
[5331.81s -> 5332.61s]  Let it...
[5332.61s -> 5333.57s]  I let the fire.
[5337.57s -> 5338.93s]  This is fucking crazy.
[5344.45s -> 5346.61s]  You probably had to pick all these enemies.
[5346.61s -> 5347.73s]  No, it's all random.
[5348.80s -> 5351.52s]  You can go in and make every enemy the same enemy,
[5351.52s -> 5353.20s]  but you can't do random.
[5353.20s -> 5354.16s]  You can't place them anywhere.
[5357.44s -> 5358.40s]  You cannot place them.
[5362.62s -> 5363.50s]  Yeah, we are...
[5363.50s -> 5365.18s]  Once I want to see the next area.
[5368.00s -> 5370.48s]  Can you imagine if From Software games were actually like this?
[5371.12s -> 5371.92s]  Well, they are.
[5371.92s -> 5373.36s]  Scholar of the First Sins did this.
[5374.46s -> 5376.46s]  That's what that expansion was.
[5377.26s -> 5378.53s]  So they did...
[5378.53s -> 5379.81s]  They already did that.
[5379.81s -> 5392.38s]  And I thought I got through.
[5395.39s -> 5395.89s]  Okay.
[5405.78s -> 5408.26s]  This guy's like just trying to pretend he's not here.
[5408.26s -> 5410.34s]  He's trying to camouflage into the wall.
[5410.34s -> 5411.30s]  Hey, I'm not here.
[5412.10s -> 5413.38s]  I'm part of the decoration.
[5418.14s -> 5419.26s]  Jeremiah lied about the clown car.
[5419.26s -> 5420.38s]  Thanks for five community subs.
[5422.05s -> 5422.45s]  Thank you.
[5425.26s -> 5426.14s]  At least I'm safe here.
[5426.86s -> 5438.30s]  I love it.
[5438.30s -> 5439.10s]  It's so dumb.
[5439.74s -> 5441.10s]  You talk about immersion breaking.
[5443.23s -> 5443.71s]  It's that...
[5445.62s -> 5445.94s]  That's like...
[5445.94s -> 5446.66s]  This is comedy.
[5446.66s -> 5447.46s]  That's just a joke.
[5447.46s -> 5448.02s]  All right.
[5448.02s -> 5448.50s]  I need to...
[5451.07s -> 5452.99s]  I'll be safe as long as I get to the button.
[5472.70s -> 5473.74s]  I can't.
[5473.74s -> 5475.02s]  I'm gonna dash through here to the T.
[5475.82s -> 5476.86s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[5476.86s -> 5477.82s]  Well, the door's open.
[5478.62s -> 5482.32s]  So at least I can probably handle that now.
[5482.88s -> 5491.17s]  I want to throw...
[5491.17s -> 5493.65s]  I want to shoot the dragon up there.
[5496.53s -> 5497.33s]  3,000.
[5497.33s -> 5497.81s]  Who died?
[5498.45s -> 5502.48s]  Can he spawn at the bonfire?
[5502.48s -> 5503.68s]  I need the Lord Vessel, don't I?
[5504.98s -> 5507.46s]  Which I'm kind of just coming to a realization here.
[5508.58s -> 5512.18s]  I think the Lord Vessel is a random item now.
[5512.82s -> 5521.17s]  Hey!
[5521.63s -> 5524.78s]  What happened to his head?
[5524.78s -> 5525.28s]  Oh.
[5543.14s -> 5543.78s]  I can't go...
[5544.50s -> 5546.02s]  Those of you that wanted me to go the rat way.
[5546.74s -> 5548.66s]  I don't think it's gonna happen.
[5549.30s -> 5557.87s]  Maybe it is.
[5557.87s -> 5579.84s]  Let's get the fuck out of here.
[5579.84s -> 5580.56s]  Okay.
[5580.56s -> 5582.00s]  Ring of the Sun Princess.
[5582.88s -> 5585.65s]  I gotta look at some of these rings.
[5586.29s -> 5595.42s]  Boost defense.
[5595.42s -> 5596.38s]  Well, boost sorcery.
[5596.38s -> 5597.66s]  Boost miracle synergy.
[5598.30s -> 5599.90s]  Well, none of these are really any good.
[5600.86s -> 5602.48s]  Here we go.
[5602.48s -> 5603.20s]  Undead Parish.
[5605.70s -> 5606.20s]  Slinky.
[5610.78s -> 5611.50s]  Demon...
[5611.50s -> 5612.70s]  Two Demon Titanite.
[5614.90s -> 5615.54s]  What?
[5615.54s -> 5616.30s]  Wait a minute.
[5616.30s -> 5620.16s]  This is the...
[5620.16s -> 5620.96s]  That's the dragon.
[5623.49s -> 5624.13s]  You all right?
[5624.93s -> 5630.77s]  He's all right.
[5630.77s -> 5636.67s]  He'll be fine.
[5636.67s -> 5638.83s]  I want to see if I can spawn that dragon.
[5638.83s -> 5640.11s]  I want to see if I can kill the dragon.
[5640.91s -> 5644.37s]  I'm gonna throw like a fire bomb at the dragon.
[5644.37s -> 5646.13s]  Let me see if I can get him to be back here.
[5646.13s -> 5648.37s]  Can I just farm Demon Titanite?
[5649.09s -> 5650.03s]  I probably can.
[5650.75s -> 5652.83s]  Yeah, I can just...
[5652.83s -> 5654.19s]  I can farm this bro.
[5654.83s -> 5656.69s]  Now, who's up here?
[5657.33s -> 5660.18s]  There's usually a Black Knight up here.
[5660.90s -> 5663.26s]  What is it now?
[5670.24s -> 5677.33s]  Ring.
[5677.33s -> 5677.89s]  And there it is.
[5677.89s -> 5678.85s]  The best ring in the game.
[5678.85s -> 5680.13s]  I will definitely take that, sure.
[5684.42s -> 5684.74s]  Thank you.
[5695.54s -> 5696.42s]  What rings you got?
[5697.14s -> 5701.23s]  I favor protection.
[5701.23s -> 5704.37s]  The unstoppable.
[5704.37s -> 5711.92s]  All right.
[5711.92s -> 5712.40s]  Let's go.
[5713.22s -> 5714.82s]  Deal with this idiot.
[5715.54s -> 5716.61s]  He threw his weapon.
[5716.61s -> 5717.33s]  Doesn't have one anymore.
[5719.54s -> 5720.34s]  That didn't hit.
[5720.34s -> 5720.84s]  Oh.
[5729.60s -> 5731.28s]  I got such a shit seed here.
[5734.24s -> 5736.64s]  I think the reroll happens at Capra Demon.
[5737.36s -> 5739.15s]  Because if Capra Demon...
[5740.19s -> 5741.46s]  Hold on.
[5741.46s -> 5741.86s]  No.
[5741.86s -> 5742.36s]  Bye.
[5742.82s -> 5748.85s]  I'm just gonna run through the...
[5748.85s -> 5749.81s]  I'm just running straight through.
[5753.66s -> 5754.86s]  If I even get there, yeah.
[5754.86s -> 5755.58s]  That's another thing.
[5755.58s -> 5756.78s]  If I can even go there.
[5759.42s -> 5759.90s]  Let's see.
[5764.51s -> 5765.07s]  I also...
[5765.07s -> 5768.14s]  I need Estes Chunks.
[5771.98s -> 5773.58s]  Well, thankfully the boar is not here.
[5775.58s -> 5777.74s]  There's just a couple of little enemies.
[5778.62s -> 5780.35s]  Okay, what have we got?
[5781.65s -> 5783.01s]  Gauntlets of the Vanquisher.
[5785.62s -> 5786.82s]  I gotta clear this.
[5786.82s -> 5788.26s]  I can't bring these guys all up here.
[5790.53s -> 5791.41s]  I mean, will it...
[5791.41s -> 5794.13s]  Hold on.
[5794.13s -> 5794.53s]  Thank god.
[5794.53s -> 5796.45s]  I think that's just a regular skeleton that just came on.
[5797.17s -> 5799.25s]  That's the first regular skeleton I think we've seen.
[5801.38s -> 5802.74s]  You're too big to fit in there.
[5802.74s -> 5803.22s]  Yeah.
[5803.22s -> 5804.02s]  So I'm safe here.
[5805.06s -> 5805.78s]  What is this?
[5806.42s -> 5808.54s]  That's another pig.
[5811.36s -> 5811.92s]  How did...
[5811.92s -> 5813.86s]  How did you get up here?
[5822.80s -> 5823.44s]  What is that?
[5835.01s -> 5836.05s]  I think he's stuck.
[5836.61s -> 5840.99s]  He can't move.
[5840.99s -> 5842.19s]  This, like, elephant thing can't move.
[5842.19s -> 5842.75s]  I can kill it.
[5856.64s -> 5863.06s]  Eldritch Horror.
[5863.06s -> 5864.90s]  His audio isn't even working.
[5864.90s -> 5867.97s]  That's the kind of enemy I feel like will crash the game.
[5868.53s -> 5872.14s]  All right, let's keep going.
[5878.40s -> 5879.28s]  There's more of these.
[5881.55s -> 5882.91s]  Say horror, horror.
[5882.91s -> 5883.63s]  Horror.
[5883.63s -> 5884.13s]  Horror.
[5899.07s -> 5900.59s]  I am in so much trouble.
[5901.15s -> 5902.78s]  I'm in so much trouble.
[5908.21s -> 5909.25s]  Don't come all the way down.
[5910.14s -> 5910.62s]  Back up.
[5910.62s -> 5911.42s]  Please back up.
[5912.62s -> 5914.54s]  You can actually fit down here.
[5915.10s -> 5923.97s]  Look at the top of the church to see the boss.
[5924.61s -> 5927.31s]  Hold on.
[5934.66s -> 5936.74s]  Nice fucking superhero anime move.
[5937.30s -> 5938.61s]  I think I can go by.
[5941.02s -> 5944.00s]  I was raided by Robaz.
[5946.69s -> 5948.61s]  Welcome everybody from Robaz's channel.
[5948.61s -> 5950.58s]  Hope Robaz...
[5950.58s -> 5951.70s]  Hope you had a good stream.
[5951.70s -> 5952.58s]  Welcome.
[5952.58s -> 5955.10s]  We're doing Dark Souls Meltdown stream.
[5955.82s -> 5956.14s]  Where...
[5957.18s -> 5959.31s]  I almost just rolled off the edge.
[5959.31s -> 5960.67s]  But this is randomizer.
[5960.67s -> 5961.55s]  Everything's randomized.
[5962.11s -> 5962.91s]  As per the name.
[5963.71s -> 5966.53s]  That means all enemies, all items.
[5966.53s -> 5967.81s]  Everything has been randomized.
[5968.69s -> 5970.21s]  And there is an Estus thing right here.
[5970.77s -> 5972.37s]  Unless it's random, which...
[5974.18s -> 5975.22s]  Yeah, I...
[5975.22s -> 5975.46s]  That...
[5975.46s -> 5976.10s]  It's all random.
[5976.10s -> 5977.30s]  I'm not gonna be able to get the Lord Vessel.
[5977.94s -> 5992.38s]  I'm gonna have five Estus Flasks the whole game.
[5993.18s -> 5999.60s]  The Lord Vessel isn't random or isn't the Estus Flasks shards not random either?
[6000.40s -> 6001.36s]  I'm gonna be screwed.
[6003.14s -> 6005.38s]  But welcome everybody from Robaz's channel.
[6006.72s -> 6007.84s]  Thanks for joining us.
[6007.84s -> 6009.76s]  If you want to stick around, there's plenty to see.
[6010.88s -> 6012.32s]  If not, then have a nice rest of your night.
[6012.88s -> 6015.28s]  And happy 4th of July soon.
[6019.90s -> 6021.74s]  Oh yeah, this doesn't have shards.
[6021.74s -> 6023.90s]  It has the Firekeeper Souls though.
[6023.90s -> 6035.86s]  The shops are also random?
[6035.86s -> 6036.90s]  That's so stupid.
[6037.62s -> 6039.82s]  All right, let's take inventory here.
[6040.62s -> 6045.92s]  I'll keep the grass shield on.
[6045.92s -> 6046.42s]  I don't...
[6047.20s -> 6049.50s]  This is good, but I don't want to use it until I need to.
[6050.22s -> 6057.84s]  I forgot, yeah, you kindle the fire.
[6057.84s -> 6058.56s]  I remember that, yeah.
[6059.44s -> 6060.40s]  All right, let's see what he got.
[6083.34s -> 6083.98s]  Let's see what he got.
[6087.86s -> 6088.90s]  What do we have for miracles?
[6099.62s -> 6101.54s]  Not very holy of you.
[6102.42s -> 6106.22s]  You got Havel's Helm and Crimson Robe.
[6106.22s -> 6107.02s]  How much is that?
[6107.02s -> 6107.58s]  Five thousand?
[6111.36s -> 6112.24s]  Free Souls?
[6113.28s -> 6114.24s]  Wait, hold on.
[6116.72s -> 6118.96s]  Oh, I thought I could buy them as many times as I wanted to.
[6121.23s -> 6122.03s]  All right, bye.
[6122.59s -> 6123.65s]  I'll come back with money.
[6124.29s -> 6128.50s]  Let's go see...
[6129.30s -> 6130.58s]  So here's my question.
[6130.58s -> 6131.38s]  The gargoyles...
[6132.99s -> 6136.19s]  Is both gargoyles considered one entity?
[6136.99s -> 6140.99s]  Or are two gargoyles going to have two different bosses here?
[6140.99s -> 6142.03s]  This is going to be horrible.
[6142.83s -> 6149.28s]  This might be the end where we have to re-roll.
[6150.08s -> 6152.16s]  Because I don't foresee this being...
[6152.80s -> 6153.52s]  What's that word again?
[6153.52s -> 6154.48s]  Oh yeah, possible.
[6155.44s -> 6157.10s]  But I've done the impossible before.
[6159.23s -> 6160.11s]  I almost...
[6160.83s -> 6164.11s]  I took like 20 to 30 attempts to jump over that bridge thing.
[6165.97s -> 6167.49s]  So, you know, anything's possible.
[6168.13s -> 6168.77s]  All right, let's go.
[6169.33s -> 6178.11s]  Thankfully, it's just a dog.
[6178.11s -> 6179.87s]  Usually it's a guy with a sword and shield.
[6180.51s -> 6184.90s]  Let's play this safe.
[6185.46s -> 6187.38s]  Wait, aren't there like 300 people in this room?
[6199.98s -> 6202.30s]  Am I even going to be able to get up the stairs?
[6202.30s -> 6206.94s]  And it's all huge, huge enemies that are so hard to beat.
[6207.90s -> 6210.00s]  I don't know how to do this.
[6210.00s -> 6225.02s]  I'm going to have to just get the throw.
[6225.02s -> 6225.82s]  He got in, he got in.
[6225.82s -> 6227.18s]  They got in, they got in, they got in, they got in.
[6227.18s -> 6227.66s]  Oh shit.
[6227.66s -> 6228.78s]  Oh my god, they're going to flood in here.
[6229.50s -> 6230.38s]  Oh god, no.
[6231.26s -> 6231.76s]  Okay.
[6245.63s -> 6248.19s]  My only option, I think, is to pull them all down here.
[6250.50s -> 6254.42s]  So then it's a bigger space and then I can run by them.
[6257.30s -> 6258.02s]  You are stuck.
[6258.58s -> 6270.86s]  All right, how much health do you have?
[6270.86s -> 6271.42s]  Way too much.
[6272.46s -> 6274.61s]  There's no chance I'll be able to fight this thing.
[6275.17s -> 6277.09s]  I got to get you over here and then I got to run around.
[6278.56s -> 6279.06s]  Goodbye.
[6280.10s -> 6281.30s]  See you later.
[6281.30s -> 6283.62s]  I also have to go get the bonfire down by the blacksmith too.
[6286.82s -> 6287.78s]  Oh fuck.
[6287.78s -> 6288.82s]  Oh no, this is not good.
[6288.82s -> 6289.32s]  Very bad.
[6290.02s -> 6291.14s]  Is it not?
[6292.32s -> 6303.67s]  I can't believe I just got fucking hit right when I was about to swing at them.
[6307.73s -> 6308.77s]  I can't believe it.
[6311.92s -> 6312.72s]  They're too big.
[6316.85s -> 6317.35s]  What?
[6318.85s -> 6320.13s]  Where are they coming from?
[6321.99s -> 6323.83s]  Why did every single one of these rolled enemies
[6323.83s -> 6326.07s]  have to be five times larger than the space?
[6336.52s -> 6338.76s]  Oh my god, and there's another one of these crabs.
[6370.76s -> 6372.60s]  No, I thought he was stuck.
[6372.60s -> 6373.89s]  I thought he was stuck.
[6373.89s -> 6374.53s]  I thought he was stuck.
[6378.64s -> 6381.52s]  What was that teleport dash?
[6382.90s -> 6384.34s]  And Andrew, what's his name?
[6384.34s -> 6385.62s]  Andrew, I need your help, please.
[6394.37s -> 6396.80s]  He cannot get down here.
[6396.80s -> 6398.16s]  There's no way it's possible.
[6398.16s -> 6399.52s]  He's not going to make it down here.
[6400.16s -> 6402.96s]  Get the bonfire right here.
[6403.60s -> 6407.01s]  Let's go see what he has for us.
[6407.01s -> 6419.16s]  By the way, let's just check what this usually is the thunder god.
[6419.80s -> 6422.37s]  It's just kind of a regular enemy here.
[6423.01s -> 6423.65s]  No, it's not.
[6423.65s -> 6424.29s]  It's one of these guys.
[6424.29s -> 6425.09s]  These guys are awful.
[6425.73s -> 6431.89s]  There we go.
[6431.89s -> 6432.84s]  Scratch that.
[6434.60s -> 6435.10s]  Easy.
[6435.48s -> 6441.08s]  A falchion.
[6442.90s -> 6443.40s]  All right.
[6449.30s -> 6450.34s]  Hello, Andrew.
[6454.12s -> 6454.62s]  Andre.
[6459.86s -> 6460.42s]  Humanity.
[6460.42s -> 6461.22s]  Large soul.
[6461.22s -> 6461.86s]  Large soul.
[6462.58s -> 6463.30s]  Homeward bone.
[6465.51s -> 6467.19s]  Velka's rapier.
[6467.75s -> 6469.03s]  Barb straight sword.
[6469.03s -> 6469.83s]  Spiked shield.
[6470.79s -> 6473.78s]  Leather boots.
[6473.78s -> 6474.58s]  Maiden gloves.
[6474.58s -> 6475.08s]  Hat.
[6483.49s -> 6486.18s]  Well, I can't none of these.
[6488.24s -> 6489.84s]  You can buy infinite souls this time.
[6490.56s -> 6497.45s]  Can I?
[6502.60s -> 6504.66s]  Well, I guess God lied to.
[6505.38s -> 6507.08s]  All right.
[6507.08s -> 6508.84s]  Let's try to make it back up there to the gargoyles.
[6513.17s -> 6514.85s]  And I'm gonna I'm gonna tune this one too.
[6514.85s -> 6516.85s]  This is a pretty central bonfire in my opinion.
[6519.12s -> 6521.44s]  Because the uh later on you have sends right there.
[6530.34s -> 6531.46s]  I don't have any humanity.
[6532.10s -> 6532.50s]  All right.
[6532.50s -> 6534.10s]  You have to actually use it.
[6552.98s -> 6553.86s]  Invades incoming.
[6553.86s -> 6554.50s]  I'm offline.
[6555.14s -> 6560.52s]  I'm gonna get this to 15.
[6569.73s -> 6570.93s]  Oh, you can't get this one to 15.
[6572.84s -> 6573.34s]  Right.
[6573.88s -> 6574.36s]  It's all right.
[6574.36s -> 6574.68s]  All right.
[6574.68s -> 6575.18s]  Cool.
[6576.84s -> 6577.34s]  Here we go.
[6577.88s -> 6579.32s]  I don't have the right of kindling.
[6579.32s -> 6579.82s]  Right.
[6582.94s -> 6587.11s]  I'm gonna make it up there and it's time to go.
[6587.11s -> 6588.63s]  You can see my bum.
[6589.43s -> 6593.75s]  You really can.
[6594.47s -> 6599.16s]  This is very revealing.
[6599.72s -> 6605.93s]  I'm gonna go quick.
[6608.06s -> 6609.50s]  You take up that much space.
[6612.02s -> 6612.90s]  I'm shocked.
[6618.95s -> 6620.39s]  It's not no way.
[6621.11s -> 6622.39s]  I have to re-roll this.
[6624.92s -> 6626.04s]  Just let it on my neck.
[6634.82s -> 6636.10s]  I have to pull them down.
[6637.24s -> 6638.60s]  They have to fall off.
[6638.60s -> 6640.36s]  And then I gotta climb the ladder.
[6640.36s -> 6642.12s]  I'm not gonna be able to get the ladder in that time.
[6642.68s -> 6643.18s]  No way.
[6643.96s -> 6648.22s]  The gargoyles are right up there though.
[6648.22s -> 6649.02s]  I need to get up there.
[6649.02s -> 6649.66s]  I'll get up there.
[6660.49s -> 6661.69s]  Everybody's so huge.
[6665.61s -> 6667.61s]  Just make a giant blockade.
[6668.33s -> 6675.28s]  Okay.
[6675.82s -> 6683.78s]  I'm not even hurting this dude.
[6691.82s -> 6692.54s]  Diagro.
[6692.54s -> 6700.36s]  Come on.
[6700.36s -> 6701.00s]  Diagro.
[6720.18s -> 6721.78s]  I just brought the other guy over.
[6730.01s -> 6731.21s]  Just reset them.
[6731.21s -> 6734.09s]  Reset them.
[6734.09s -> 6747.16s]  Just kill me.
[6747.16s -> 6747.96s]  Damn it.
[6747.96s -> 6753.13s]  Can I re-roll while the game is open?
[6754.50s -> 6754.74s]  No.
[6754.74s -> 6756.34s]  That would probably be a very bad idea, right?
[6757.06s -> 6767.30s]  I'll try this one more time.
[6767.30s -> 6773.88s]  Because he's in the spot right now where he's very easily just block the door.
[6774.52s -> 6776.46s]  Hey, he's gonna block it every time.
[6776.46s -> 6779.40s]  There we go.
[6779.40s -> 6779.88s]  I made it.
[6783.32s -> 6783.96s]  All right, come on.
[6783.96s -> 6784.60s]  I'm...
[6784.60s -> 6785.48s]  Forget about the dog.
[6785.48s -> 6786.28s]  I'm going right up.
[6794.73s -> 6795.23s]  No!
[6795.85s -> 6801.00s]  All right.
[6801.00s -> 6802.12s]  I have to do this tactically.
[6802.68s -> 6808.84s]  How do I tactically take care of this?
[6809.40s -> 6812.25s]  All right.
[6812.25s -> 6813.37s]  Now they have to all fall down.
[6813.37s -> 6813.85s]  So here we go.
[6813.85s -> 6814.35s]  Ready?
[6815.58s -> 6817.02s]  Now they're all looking at me.
[6817.02s -> 6818.60s]  Now get them to all fall down.
[6830.98s -> 6832.18s]  Come on, all of you.
[6832.18s -> 6834.42s]  The whole entire trip of you come down.
[6834.42s -> 6835.46s]  Come on, please.
[6835.46s -> 6835.94s]  All right, go.
[6839.37s -> 6840.17s]  I don't think there's anything...
[6840.89s -> 6841.85s]  You motherfucker.
[6841.85s -> 6842.97s]  You're the only one.
[6842.97s -> 6844.41s]  You're the only one.
[6844.41s -> 6861.50s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[6865.53s -> 6866.49s]  That was the one, too.
[6866.49s -> 6868.97s]  I have to pull them all down that little hallway.
[6868.97s -> 6869.47s]  They'll...
[6870.95s -> 6871.27s]  Sorry.
[6871.27s -> 6872.15s]  I'm good.
[6872.15s -> 6872.63s]  I'll get it.
[6873.27s -> 6879.34s]  I'm just gonna walk straight through his legs.
[6880.06s -> 6889.64s]  He'll do that every time.
[6890.36s -> 6892.06s]  All right.
[6892.06s -> 6892.54s]  Here we go.
[6902.54s -> 6902.94s]  Agro.
[6902.94s -> 6903.34s]  Everybody.
[6903.90s -> 6905.10s]  Here they all come.
[6905.10s -> 6905.98s]  Hey, look at me.
[6905.98s -> 6906.70s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[6906.70s -> 6907.74s]  You're all very, very cool.
[6907.74s -> 6908.22s]  Here we go.
[6909.93s -> 6910.49s]  There's you.
[6914.81s -> 6917.53s]  I have to wait till that weird blob,
[6917.53s -> 6919.77s]  amorphous, weird thing falls down, too.
[6919.77s -> 6924.33s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[6924.33s -> 6924.81s]  There it is.
[6924.81s -> 6925.29s]  They're all down.
[6928.23s -> 6929.59s]  Nothing is gonna block the way now.
[6930.23s -> 6932.74s]  There's gonna be a slug right here.
[6934.17s -> 6934.57s]  No.
[6934.57s -> 6934.89s]  Good.
[6934.89s -> 6935.13s]  Go.
[6945.16s -> 6945.96s]  Oh, Jesus.
[6946.68s -> 6947.35s]  All right.
[6947.35s -> 6955.96s]  I made it.
[6955.96s -> 6956.52s]  Here we go.
[6972.33s -> 6973.13s]  Did the gargoyle...
[6974.09s -> 6975.77s]  Is that a gargoyle up in the top left?
[6975.85s -> 6976.89s]  Is this a skeleton?
[6986.09s -> 6986.41s]  What?
[6986.97s -> 6987.21s]  No.
[6987.21s -> 6987.85s]  What is that?
[6992.30s -> 6993.98s]  I don't know what I'm looking at here.
[7006.36s -> 7011.62s]  He's being pulled through a fucking black hole.
[7016.82s -> 7017.14s]  Wait.
[7017.14s -> 7018.66s]  What do you mean bell gargoyle?
[7018.66s -> 7019.22s]  Is there gonna be a...
[7020.10s -> 7042.28s]  Shit.
[7043.00s -> 7069.69s]  Ow.
[7069.69s -> 7077.48s]  Oh, fuck.
[7077.48s -> 7078.04s]  Oh, my God.
[7078.04s -> 7078.20s]  No.
[7083.66s -> 7084.54s]  Oh, I didn't dodge it.
[7085.10s -> 7085.50s]  I'm bad.
[7085.50s -> 7086.94s]  I'm in trouble.
[7086.94s -> 7106.50s]  He's fucked up.
[7106.50s -> 7107.38s]  His AI is fucked up.
[7107.38s -> 7109.93s]  No, it's not.
[7109.93s -> 7110.89s]  Off the edge.
[7110.89s -> 7111.53s]  Back up.
[7111.53s -> 7112.09s]  Off the edge.
[7112.09s -> 7112.33s]  Quick.
[7112.89s -> 7114.49s]  Wait, he can fly.
[7152.33s -> 7152.81s]  I don't think...
[7153.45s -> 7154.87s]  I don't think that's possible.
[7156.79s -> 7157.83s]  Use the dark hand?
[7159.22s -> 7159.86s]  Reroll.
[7159.86s -> 7160.34s]  Reroll.
[7160.34s -> 7160.50s]  All right.
[7160.50s -> 7161.14s]  Let's reroll.
[7161.14s -> 7161.70s]  Let's reroll.
[7161.70s -> 7162.34s]  We're gonna reroll it.
[7162.34s -> 7162.74s]  Here we go.
[7163.38s -> 7171.21s]  Wait, hold on.
[7171.21s -> 7173.93s]  Should I put the crystal sword on?
[7175.51s -> 7177.03s]  It's gonna spawn another boss.
[7179.40s -> 7180.12s]  Go down to...
[7180.12s -> 7180.28s]  All right.
[7180.28s -> 7180.92s]  I could go down.
[7181.82s -> 7181.98s]  Yeah.
[7181.98s -> 7182.70s]  Let's do...
[7182.70s -> 7183.42s]  I'll do dark root.
[7183.42s -> 7184.22s]  I'll try dark root.
[7190.07s -> 7191.99s]  I'm allowed to reroll once an hour.
[7200.68s -> 7201.08s]  Yeah.
[7201.08s -> 7202.04s]  Can I upgrade the hammer?
[7202.04s -> 7203.08s]  What does it take?
[7203.08s -> 7206.79s]  I can.
[7206.79s -> 7207.67s]  What is it?
[7207.67s -> 7209.43s]  Twinkling titanite, unfortunately.
[7216.84s -> 7217.32s]  I'll try...
[7218.44s -> 7219.48s]  Here's the thing about the butterfly.
[7220.84s -> 7222.84s]  This could be a very, very good thing.
[7222.84s -> 7224.92s]  Because the butterfly might just spawn in the air
[7224.92s -> 7226.44s]  when I go through the bonfire
[7226.44s -> 7227.40s]  and just fall and die.
[7228.78s -> 7230.14s]  If it's not the butterfly.
[7231.40s -> 7233.80s]  So it might actually be a pretty good idea.
[7234.60s -> 7243.22s]  Thanks for the easy enemy.
[7243.94s -> 7246.65s]  I really appreciate that.
[7246.65s -> 7253.70s]  What the hell was that?
[7257.58s -> 7258.46s]  It's dead, whatever it was.
[7259.10s -> 7278.01s]  Yeah, this is our remastered.
[7278.01s -> 7279.69s]  That is the best T-pose I've ever seen.
[7281.46s -> 7282.18s]  Ow.
[7282.18s -> 7286.55s]  It's marvelous.
[7286.55s -> 7302.44s]  What am I stuck on?
[7317.62s -> 7317.86s]  How?
[7322.70s -> 7323.26s]  No!
[7323.26s -> 7324.06s]  Don't die here.
[7325.56s -> 7326.36s]  I don't know what it is.
[7326.36s -> 7328.60s]  I've always had trouble with these snakes.
[7328.60s -> 7329.40s]  For some weird reason.
[7329.40s -> 7330.04s]  I don't know what it is.
[7331.53s -> 7332.33s]  Like, I don't know what it is,
[7332.33s -> 7333.05s]  but I don't know what it is,
[7333.05s -> 7333.85s]  but I don't know what it is.
[7334.65s -> 7349.26s]  All right, let's go butterfly.
[7349.26s -> 7350.30s]  I just have to get through here.
[7351.10s -> 7352.30s]  Don't forget about the secret.
[7352.30s -> 7354.22s]  Don't forget about the bonfire that's right here.
[7354.94s -> 7358.90s]  You never played Dark Souls before.
[7358.90s -> 7359.46s]  It's right there.
[7360.18s -> 7370.89s]  Am I gonna be able to...
[7370.89s -> 7372.73s]  I can't get that open ever.
[7373.37s -> 7388.10s]  Moonlight Robe and Red Sign Soapstone.
[7388.10s -> 7389.70s]  Well, at least I can invade somebody now.
[7390.26s -> 7402.50s]  Let's go.
[7403.14s -> 7406.14s]  Now, if I remember that there's
[7407.10s -> 7408.62s]  like six or seven enemies over here,
[7409.26s -> 7413.51s]  and they're all crabs and shit.
[7413.51s -> 7414.71s]  Why does it have to be crabs?
[7415.59s -> 7424.42s]  Thankfully, they're not getting up.
[7425.06s -> 7436.31s]  Homeward Bone.
[7436.31s -> 7437.83s]  Key to the Seal.
[7437.83s -> 7445.18s]  Do I get to skip Light Town?
[7445.18s -> 7446.14s]  Wait a minute.
[7446.14s -> 7455.69s]  Key to the floodgates of New Londo,
[7455.69s -> 7457.45s]  which seal away the Four Kings.
[7457.45s -> 7458.89s]  Oh, it's the Four Kings.
[7462.57s -> 7463.53s]  That's so stupid.
[7480.26s -> 7481.06s]  Will they aggro?
[7481.62s -> 7484.22s]  I don't want to fight these guys.
[7484.22s -> 7485.02s]  I'm just gonna go around the edge.
[7490.90s -> 7491.78s]  I'm putting up with this.
[7499.53s -> 7500.49s]  Giant Rat?
[7500.49s -> 7506.92s]  Just a regular rat, actually.
[7507.56s -> 7516.09s]  Is there something back here?
[7516.73s -> 7523.58s]  You need to get every single item.
[7523.58s -> 7525.34s]  One of them is going to be the Lord Vessel.
[7525.34s -> 7525.90s]  I know.
[7525.90s -> 7526.78s]  That's what I'm saying.
[7526.78s -> 7529.10s]  I think I have it set that key items
[7529.82s -> 7530.46s]  are not...
[7533.18s -> 7536.30s]  T-Pussing Dragon is so stupid.
[7536.30s -> 7538.06s]  He's just doing a plane impression.
[7551.22s -> 7552.26s]  Oh my god!
[7553.30s -> 7555.30s]  Why did they all come to life instantly?
[7555.94s -> 7568.62s]  Well, at least I got the item.
[7577.43s -> 7579.27s]  Oh, a golden legend.
[7580.15s -> 7587.05s]  Get out of here.
[7589.78s -> 7590.58s]  No, no, no.
[7592.41s -> 7592.89s]  Hold on.
[7596.66s -> 7597.70s]  Isn't this shit down here?
[7598.42s -> 7618.06s]  There's like three to four items.
[7618.06s -> 7621.13s]  Yeah.
[7621.13s -> 7622.65s]  I hope one of them is the Lord Vessel.
[7622.65s -> 7623.77s]  I would laugh my ass off.
[7624.57s -> 7632.41s]  Oh, no.
[7633.37s -> 7634.25s]  Don't do it, Jeremy.
[7634.25s -> 7636.01s]  No, that's not what's gonna get you killed.
[7636.01s -> 7636.73s]  It's not that.
[7636.73s -> 7637.53s]  It's the enemies.
[7640.28s -> 7641.56s]  Oh, I'm in trouble now.
[7641.56s -> 7642.68s]  Oh, I've really done it now.
[7663.03s -> 7664.95s]  Crystal Shield, Shortbow.
[7664.95s -> 7667.40s]  Fuck, these guys are horrible.
[7667.40s -> 7669.24s]  I remember they're in the depths, right?
[7669.24s -> 7671.48s]  The catacombs with that pitch black place.
[7672.28s -> 7676.02s]  Nothing else.
[7676.02s -> 7676.82s]  Get up back up.
[7676.82s -> 7677.46s]  I don't even care.
[7678.50s -> 7698.39s]  Tomb of the Giant, not the catacombs, though.
[7699.03s -> 7701.77s]  I knew it was one of them.
[7701.77s -> 7703.45s]  Whatever the one is that is all dark.
[7710.06s -> 7710.86s]  Missed item.
[7710.86s -> 7712.70s]  It's too dangerous down there right now.
[7726.26s -> 7727.62s]  It could be the Lord Vessel.
[7727.62s -> 7731.43s]  This is gonna be the Lord Vessel.
[7731.43s -> 7732.55s]  What the fuck?
[7732.55s -> 7742.33s]  All right, got that item.
[7742.89s -> 7746.34s]  All right, now I just gotta go this way
[7746.34s -> 7747.62s]  and then we gotta fight the butterfly.
[7747.62s -> 7748.58s]  Let's see what it's gonna be.
[7750.23s -> 7751.99s]  I'm thinking the butterfly is gonna be...
[7753.19s -> 7759.10s]  What do you get?
[7759.10s -> 7759.66s]  Place your bets.
[7760.30s -> 7772.49s]  Who do you think?
[7773.13s -> 7775.77s]  It's gonna be Gwyn.
[7775.77s -> 7777.93s]  Whoever it is, they're gonna fall right to their death.
[7777.93s -> 7779.16s]  Here we go.
[7787.85s -> 7789.37s]  It's Ornstein.
[7790.09s -> 7790.97s]  Ornstein.
[7790.97s -> 7792.57s]  And he is so huge.
[7793.66s -> 7794.22s]  I don't...
[7794.22s -> 7795.02s]  He needs to fall off.
[7808.97s -> 7809.69s]  He's not dead?
[7810.33s -> 7811.94s]  What do you mean he's not dead?
[7812.58s -> 7815.70s]  How is he still alive?
[7817.62s -> 7820.34s]  He fell off the edge, but he was so big
[7820.34s -> 7821.70s]  that the fall damage didn't kill him.
[7837.37s -> 7838.33s]  Just menu him.
[7838.33s -> 7838.73s]  Hold on.
[7838.73s -> 7839.13s]  Not yet.
[7839.77s -> 7841.22s]  I may be able to get him to walk off.
[7841.86s -> 7861.66s]  I don't even see him.
[7862.46s -> 7865.53s]  No, I'm just gonna reload
[7865.53s -> 7866.89s]  and he'll probably die, right?
[7870.73s -> 7890.02s]  All right, here we go.
[7890.02s -> 7891.62s]  No, it just resets the area.
[7899.54s -> 7900.02s]  Where am I?
[7904.14s -> 7904.38s]  I...
[7905.02s -> 7916.17s]  He died to moonlit butterfly.
[7918.97s -> 7923.11s]  I gotta get him to fall off
[7923.11s -> 7925.19s]  to where there's no ground
[7925.19s -> 7926.79s]  and it's that side that he's on.
[7926.79s -> 7927.75s]  I'll get there, hold on.
[7950.63s -> 7952.41s]  All right, let's try this again.
[7953.29s -> 7954.89s]  I have to get him to fall off up here.
[7955.53s -> 7964.58s]  Over this way, come here.
[7965.22s -> 7966.36s]  You're gonna fall off here.
[7967.16s -> 7969.82s]  Can I just kill him?
[7969.82s -> 7971.10s]  He doesn't have that much health, does he?
[7973.93s -> 7974.17s]  Fall.
[7976.09s -> 7977.13s]  Fall that way.
[7977.13s -> 7983.11s]  He's got a dickload of health.
[7983.11s -> 7984.23s]  What am I talking about?
[7984.23s -> 7984.71s]  There he goes.
[7984.71s -> 7985.27s]  All right, dead.
[7993.30s -> 7994.82s]  No, it has to be over here.
[7995.54s -> 8026.70s]  This room is not programmed to kill bosses who fall.
[8026.70s -> 8027.42s]  Yeah, that's right
[8027.42s -> 8029.50s]  because there is no way to fall.
[8029.50s -> 8035.38s]  Falling is not possible.
[8035.38s -> 8052.52s]  Optional, so it doesn't matter.
[8052.52s -> 8053.64s]  I'm gonna try to fight him.
[8055.22s -> 8056.58s]  Here's the problem about fighting him.
[8058.36s -> 8059.80s]  I might actually get him down to halfway
[8059.80s -> 8061.16s]  and he'll fall off.
[8061.16s -> 8072.90s]  It's gonna take forever.
[8081.61s -> 8081.93s]  Shit!
[8092.46s -> 8093.02s]  Just wait.
[8094.31s -> 8095.75s]  I don't think it's gonna happen.
[8095.75s -> 8097.11s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[8097.83s -> 8098.57s]  Just wait.
[8100.79s -> 8101.35s]  Just wait.
[8101.91s -> 8120.65s]  You sounded like a crosswalk.
[8121.58s -> 8121.82s]  Wait.
[8122.82s -> 8123.14s]  Wait.
[8125.75s -> 8126.07s]  Wait.
[8127.08s -> 8127.40s]  Wait.
[8129.02s -> 8129.66s]  I'm getting baited.
[8137.67s -> 8138.39s]  Reroll.
[8138.39s -> 8139.19s]  Time to reroll.
[8142.38s -> 8143.34s]  It's reroll time.
[8144.78s -> 8145.98s]  I think we're locked.
[8145.98s -> 8150.34s]  Here we go.
[8150.34s -> 8157.64s]  It's time to reroll.
[8157.64s -> 8158.92s]  Wait.
[8158.92s -> 8159.24s]  Wait.
[8161.64s -> 8163.67s]  All right, I'm gonna do it.
[8163.67s -> 8164.95s]  This time I'm gonna make it.
[8164.95s -> 8166.63s]  We're gonna up the ante a little bit here.
[8166.63s -> 8175.80s]  So this time, let's see.
[8175.80s -> 8176.76s]  Let's do...
[8176.76s -> 8181.24s]  I can have it be replace bosses with only bosses
[8181.24s -> 8185.00s]  with normal enemies or with bosses or normal enemies.
[8185.00s -> 8191.13s]  Replace normal enemies with bosses or normal enemies.
[8194.49s -> 8195.21s]  Or, okay.
[8196.18s -> 8198.42s]  How about replace normal enemies with bosses?
[8200.39s -> 8202.07s]  Might have to reroll this one instantly.
[8204.22s -> 8206.70s]  Replace all normal enemies with bosses.
[8208.34s -> 8213.72s]  That's clown show though.
[8213.72s -> 8214.68s]  No, we're not there yet.
[8214.68s -> 8215.48s]  We aren't there yet.
[8218.07s -> 8220.55s]  Replace NPCs with bosses.
[8221.48s -> 8222.44s]  I think that's kind of fun.
[8228.41s -> 8231.26s]  All right.
[8231.26s -> 8232.78s]  Enemy placement anywhere.
[8232.78s -> 8235.02s]  Percentage for a boss to spawn.
[8235.02s -> 8236.78s]  Chance that a boss will be replaced with a boss
[8236.78s -> 8238.30s]  instead of a normal enemy.
[8238.30s -> 8239.18s]  I'm gonna put this at...
[8239.18s -> 8240.06s]  Let's put this at 50%.
[8244.90s -> 8245.94s]  100%.
[8245.94s -> 8247.06s]  No, that's too wild.
[8248.31s -> 8249.35s]  Let's do like 30%.
[8250.23s -> 8251.74s]  That's better.
[8254.14s -> 8254.62s]  All right, here we go.
[8254.62s -> 8255.42s]  I'm rolling it.
[8255.42s -> 8255.90s]  You ready?
[8256.86s -> 8258.06s]  Three, two, one.
[8258.06s -> 8258.54s]  Here it comes.
[8277.13s -> 8277.69s]  This is gonna...
[8277.69s -> 8277.93s]  Hold on.
[8277.93s -> 8279.13s]  Wait, I gotta do it again.
[8279.13s -> 8283.08s]  This is gonna be fucking nuts.
[8284.23s -> 8286.55s]  33% chance for a normal enemy to be boss.
[8296.82s -> 8299.30s]  We may or may not have to redo this again.
[8299.30s -> 8299.94s]  Because this...
[8299.94s -> 8301.38s]  And I'm not rerolling the items.
[8301.38s -> 8302.66s]  The items are still the same.
[8302.66s -> 8303.70s]  That's way too high.
[8305.22s -> 8305.78s]  We'll see.
[8305.78s -> 8306.42s]  It might not be.
[8306.42s -> 8306.90s]  Well, maybe we'll...
[8307.94s -> 8309.22s]  Maybe we'll get a good roll here.
[8309.94s -> 8314.55s]  All right, let's get back in.
[8315.19s -> 8318.09s]  Let's see who we rolled Orenstein into.
[8318.81s -> 8320.97s]  Now it's possible that Orenstein could be rolled into a skeleton.
[8320.97s -> 8321.77s]  And I'll kill him in one hit.
[8325.42s -> 8327.10s]  Every three monsters is a boss.
[8328.12s -> 8328.52s]  Kind of.
[8334.60s -> 8335.56s]  That's too high.
[8335.56s -> 8338.36s]  Well, it's all right.
[8338.92s -> 8346.62s]  Here we go.
[8346.62s -> 8357.38s]  I think it's a normal enemy.
[8360.18s -> 8363.16s]  Moonlit Butterfly is...
[8364.52s -> 8365.64s]  I think it's just like a chef.
[8384.41s -> 8385.69s]  That's the easiest boss in the game.
[8385.69s -> 8386.33s]  Pyromance.
[8386.33s -> 8387.29s]  The Acid Surge.
[8388.17s -> 8389.21s]  Purple Moss Clump.
[8389.77s -> 8390.49s]  And what?
[8390.49s -> 8391.61s]  I don't even know what I just picked up.
[8391.61s -> 8392.73s]  There was like five items here.
[8392.73s -> 8393.37s]  What did I just get?
[8403.27s -> 8404.07s]  Acid Surge.
[8406.33s -> 8406.97s]  Humanity.
[8406.97s -> 8409.86s]  Okay.
[8409.86s -> 8410.10s]  Nice.
[8414.97s -> 8418.14s]  All right.
[8418.14s -> 8419.10s]  Did you reroll items?
[8419.10s -> 8419.66s]  No, I did not.
[8420.22s -> 8423.74s]  I will not reroll items until it's very, very necessary.
[8423.74s -> 8425.34s]  And maybe when I reroll the items,
[8425.34s -> 8427.50s]  maybe we'll do it a few times and get something weird.
[8433.54s -> 8438.84s]  I don't know.
[8438.84s -> 8440.92s]  Hello Carving is what was up here.
[8441.72s -> 8442.76s]  And Helm of Thorns.
[8444.04s -> 8444.92s]  And Wolf Ring.
[8445.56s -> 8454.60s]  Hello.
[8454.60s -> 8456.15s]  What's that helmet?
[8456.15s -> 8457.11s]  Helm of Thorns.
[8457.75s -> 8458.47s]  Yeah, let's get it on.
[8459.27s -> 8459.51s]  All right.
[8459.51s -> 8469.80s]  Let's head back down and let's have the fun begin again.
[8470.36s -> 8472.20s]  Now I'm going to go try to do the gargoyles again
[8472.20s -> 8474.12s]  because it's going to be something different.
[8475.02s -> 8475.42s]  Use it.
[8475.42s -> 8475.74s]  Use it.
[8475.74s -> 8476.70s]  No, I don't think so.
[8476.70s -> 8477.18s]  I don't want to.
[8478.47s -> 8479.27s]  No, no, no.
[8479.27s -> 8479.83s]  I don't think so.
[8487.80s -> 8488.20s]  Do it.
[8488.20s -> 8488.60s]  All right.
[8488.60s -> 8488.84s]  Fine.
[8490.86s -> 8492.70s]  Hello.
[8492.70s -> 8496.42s]  God.
[8496.42s -> 8499.99s]  That wasn't it?
[8502.84s -> 8505.40s]  That was an exact audio replication of that item.
[8514.26s -> 8516.18s]  Why is the rat so big now?
[8516.74s -> 8522.57s]  I didn't do anything to increase the rat's size.
[8522.57s -> 8523.45s]  Why is he huge?
[8524.17s -> 8538.79s]  This is kind of freaking me out.
[8540.97s -> 8541.77s]  He's enormous.
[8542.49s -> 8552.26s]  Okay.
[8555.72s -> 8556.68s]  Let's go back.
[8556.68s -> 8558.04s]  I want to do the gargoyles again.
[8558.76s -> 8561.19s]  I need to level up too.
[8561.75s -> 8566.94s]  I hope the gargoyle is a rat.
[8566.94s -> 8568.78s]  I hope the gargoyle is two hollows.
[8569.82s -> 8570.78s]  Are two hollows.
[8574.07s -> 8575.27s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[8585.19s -> 8585.43s]  All right.
[8585.43s -> 8586.23s]  Let's do strength.
[8590.97s -> 8591.85s]  Where are all the bosses?
[8591.85s -> 8593.37s]  See, I told you it was a decent number.
[8594.57s -> 8598.33s]  That means there's a 70% chance and it rolls every time.
[8598.33s -> 8601.13s]  70%, 70%, 70% that it's not going to be a boss.
[8601.93s -> 8616.46s]  This thing is freaky.
[8624.46s -> 8625.18s]  Got it.
[8625.18s -> 8631.42s]  Another one of those blobs.
[8632.14s -> 8633.02s]  Just avoid it.
[8644.60s -> 8646.90s]  I don't want anything to do with you.
[8649.37s -> 8649.69s]  Ow.
[8650.41s -> 8652.20s]  My back is so itchy.
[8652.84s -> 8659.83s]  Could you put Bart Simpson in with this mod?
[8659.83s -> 8660.71s]  I don't think so.
[8660.71s -> 8661.83s]  It has to.
[8661.83s -> 8662.07s]  No.
[8662.63s -> 8669.02s]  A secure randomizer.
[8669.42s -> 8673.26s]  I think that game may be not completable, but you can.
[8676.14s -> 8676.94s]  Let's upgrade the hammer.
[8679.54s -> 8680.98s]  Wait, I need twinkling titanite.
[8680.98s -> 8681.94s]  Never mind.
[8681.94s -> 8686.57s]  There's a mod for custom skins.
[8686.57s -> 8688.17s]  I feel like that would be so hard to implement.
[8695.21s -> 8696.89s]  Andre, you look a little...
[8696.89s -> 8697.85s]  Hi, Andre.
[8697.85s -> 8698.25s]  Speaking...
[8698.25s -> 8698.97s]  No, never mind.
[8699.85s -> 8701.21s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[8701.21s -> 8701.93s]  Don't say it.
[8701.93s -> 8702.97s]  I know what everyone's going to say.
[8714.39s -> 8715.43s]  That's pretty good, though.
[8723.03s -> 8723.91s]  These didn't change.
[8728.98s -> 8730.98s]  There's a reference I can make here, but I'm not going to.
[8731.78s -> 8734.60s]  Uh-oh.
[8735.16s -> 8755.66s]  I have to re-roll.
[8759.88s -> 8762.44s]  I got to go through the Valley of the Drakes.
[8762.44s -> 8762.84s]  Yep.
[8762.84s -> 8764.52s]  I got to go around the whole thing.
[8764.52s -> 8772.12s]  Just kick him?
[8775.21s -> 8788.79s]  Does he stay like this forever?
[8791.77s -> 8792.41s]  He doesn't, right?
[8793.05s -> 8804.25s]  I just fucked up the whole game.
[8813.70s -> 8814.42s]  Wait, no, no, no.
[8814.42s -> 8815.30s]  I can remove sins.
[8815.30s -> 8816.18s]  I can remove sins.
[8817.22s -> 8817.78s]  That's right.
[8817.78s -> 8818.10s]  Okay.
[8818.10s -> 8818.98s]  Everything's going to be fine.
[8818.98s -> 8820.26s]  I just can't level up any items.
[8823.50s -> 8826.06s]  You have to beat the gargoyles to get them de-aggroed.
[8826.06s -> 8826.46s]  That's it.
[8826.46s -> 8827.02s]  I can do that.
[8839.35s -> 8839.91s]  What?
[8839.91s -> 8843.62s]  I don't understand.
[8843.70s -> 8848.49s]  Um, it's that...
[8858.34s -> 8861.70s]  How do they get them both as the demon?
[8863.38s -> 8864.66s]  10,000 souls for free.
[8864.66s -> 8865.70s]  Oh, look, a skeleton.
[8866.42s -> 8867.51s]  So scary.
[8870.30s -> 8870.78s]  I'm going to...
[8870.78s -> 8871.82s]  I got to go to this bonfire.
[8874.74s -> 8874.98s]  What?
[8875.62s -> 8877.02s]  Get it?
[8877.02s -> 8877.50s]  No, no, no.
[8877.50s -> 8877.90s]  I need...
[8877.90s -> 8878.62s]  I want this bonfire.
[8879.26s -> 8899.83s]  That was the centipede demon.
[8899.83s -> 8909.58s]  You're not changed.
[8909.58s -> 8910.46s]  That's kind of freaking me out.
[8910.46s -> 8922.49s]  Why are you still the same?
[8922.49s -> 8923.93s]  Did he roll into himself?
[8932.44s -> 8933.16s]  All right.
[8933.16s -> 8936.66s]  Now we're going to go back and it's this Capra demon.
[8936.66s -> 8937.22s]  That's fine.
[8942.06s -> 8943.74s]  Yeah, I'll get the secret items on the elevator.
[8943.74s -> 8944.38s]  Not a bad idea.
[8944.94s -> 8959.02s]  How high up is it?
[8959.02s -> 8960.94s]  Is this the first cliff or the second cliff?
[8960.94s -> 8962.14s]  I think it's the second cliff, right?
[8964.60s -> 8965.80s]  There's two ways to go, right?
[8966.76s -> 8968.81s]  Or this is just the first cliff.
[8977.34s -> 8978.70s]  Yeah, it's that first one.
[8981.24s -> 8982.92s]  When you walk up the tree, you go to the bird.
[8983.80s -> 8985.40s]  There is only one, right?
[8985.40s -> 8988.20s]  I'm like combining every game I've played from From Software.
[8989.00s -> 9001.38s]  Okay, so I got those.
[9001.38s -> 9001.78s]  Isn't there...
[9001.78s -> 9002.74s]  Yeah, there's those up there.
[9003.78s -> 9004.74s]  How do I get up there?
[9004.74s -> 9005.54s]  Can I even get up there?
[9006.42s -> 9008.06s]  Wait, I already got those.
[9008.70s -> 9011.62s]  How do I get across there?
[9012.34s -> 9019.24s]  Oh yeah, you jump, right?
[9019.24s -> 9020.28s]  Now you jump to one of these.
[9021.16s -> 9030.79s]  Now you jump from here.
[9035.64s -> 9035.96s]  Whoops.
[9035.96s -> 9036.60s]  I was trying to...
[9036.60s -> 9037.88s]  I got fucking locked.
[9039.29s -> 9041.13s]  Yeah, you jump from the grass part.
[9041.13s -> 9041.77s]  It's been a while.
[9045.45s -> 9046.41s]  I got stuck down there.
[9057.80s -> 9059.00s]  Now you get AI?
[9059.00s -> 9061.64s]  All of a sudden, the first time in two and a half hours,
[9062.28s -> 9067.94s]  the armored pigs have artificial intelligence now.
[9067.94s -> 9071.67s]  It took you 10 of those for you to do anything.
[9072.23s -> 9073.78s]  Well, let's do this again.
[9074.42s -> 9084.81s]  This is my first Dark Souls experience.
[9084.81s -> 9086.09s]  This game looks fun, but hard.
[9087.59s -> 9088.47s]  Yeah, it is.
[9088.47s -> 9091.58s]  It is pretty hard, especially considering
[9093.10s -> 9095.98s]  when they do this, all the random bosses that spawn.
[9096.78s -> 9099.06s]  It's like weird that they put that in the game.
[9101.58s -> 9103.34s]  Oh yeah, so jump from here to there, right?
[9103.34s -> 9104.22s]  Yeah, right here.
[9106.73s -> 9108.25s]  I'm so awful at this kind of shit.
[9108.97s -> 9110.20s]  I got it.
[9110.20s -> 9115.34s]  All right, there's items.
[9115.90s -> 9116.70s]  Is there one over here?
[9117.26s -> 9119.64s]  Up there.
[9121.18s -> 9122.62s]  Actually, I have to fall from there, don't I?
[9123.34s -> 9137.11s]  Anything in the nest?
[9143.22s -> 9143.62s]  Mimics?
[9143.62s -> 9144.98s]  I'm not even sure Mimics spawn.
[9145.70s -> 9146.42s]  I don't think it can.
[9147.14s -> 9148.10s]  Isn't it impossible?
[9158.04s -> 9158.84s]  Master key.
[9159.72s -> 9164.84s]  What does the...
[9164.84s -> 9166.36s]  Open any basic lock.
[9166.36s -> 9167.56s]  Oh, right.
[9168.94s -> 9169.18s]  Cool.
[9170.06s -> 9173.42s]  Is there anything else up here?
[9173.98s -> 9183.50s]  Whoa, don't fall off.
[9183.50s -> 9189.77s]  It's slipping me off into the nest.
[9190.33s -> 9197.42s]  Is there an item in the nest?
[9197.42s -> 9198.22s]  Wasn't I just up there?
[9198.78s -> 9204.14s]  I'm going to fucking fall off here.
[9208.92s -> 9211.21s]  Yep, bye.
[9211.21s -> 9212.09s]  Whatever.
[9212.09s -> 9218.46s]  All right, I'm going forward.
[9219.02s -> 9225.71s]  Hello?
[9235.82s -> 9237.42s]  That fucking hurt my face.
[9237.42s -> 9238.62s]  My chest hurts.
[9239.50s -> 9240.86s]  I just did not expect that at all.
[9255.42s -> 9256.70s]  Okay, he's dead.
[9256.70s -> 9261.85s]  I'm sorry about that loud noise.
[9261.85s -> 9262.97s]  That was fucking terrifying.
[9269.14s -> 9272.98s]  All right, I'm going back to the tower to go to the gargoyles.
[9273.62s -> 9276.33s]  He was silent.
[9276.33s -> 9276.97s]  It was completely...
[9276.97s -> 9278.09s]  There was no sound at all.
[9278.09s -> 9279.21s]  It was silent.
[9280.89s -> 9282.41s]  That was so quiet.
[9283.05s -> 9286.58s]  Use the nest, go back to the undead asylum.
[9286.58s -> 9287.46s]  Yeah, we can do that.
[9288.02s -> 9289.06s]  I want to do this first, though.
[9289.78s -> 9296.28s]  Because then...
[9296.28s -> 9297.32s]  Well, it was sift before.
[9297.40s -> 9298.60s]  Now who knows what hell it is now.
[9301.88s -> 9302.44s]  It's my birthday.
[9302.44s -> 9303.64s]  Can you say what's up, sinners?
[9304.28s -> 9305.78s]  What's going on, sinners?
[9305.78s -> 9306.42s]  Happy birthday.
[9308.33s -> 9309.53s]  I don't know why I just even did that.
[9322.04s -> 9323.64s]  This is going to be horrible getting up here.
[9323.64s -> 9324.68s]  Oh no, a slug.
[9325.56s -> 9326.60s]  Thank God it's not a boss.
[9327.64s -> 9337.21s]  Okay.
[9350.38s -> 9352.46s]  We got to do the same thing again.
[9352.46s -> 9353.98s]  We got to pull everybody down.
[9353.98s -> 9355.82s]  Oh, hey, guess what?
[9355.82s -> 9365.67s]  The demon just jumped off a cliff somewhere.
[9365.67s -> 9366.63s]  Come on, everybody.
[9367.27s -> 9371.43s]  Holy shit, that reach went through the whole cathedral.
[9372.71s -> 9376.87s]  Oh, come on.
[9377.43s -> 9383.82s]  Let's try this again.
[9392.04s -> 9392.68s]  Unbelievable.
[9394.44s -> 9397.08s]  Well, now I know he can reach me from wherever he's standing.
[9398.28s -> 9399.08s]  Click on the link.
[9401.13s -> 9403.75s]  Link, link, link.
[9403.75s -> 9411.45s]  What is this just going up?
[9411.45s -> 9414.09s]  I will get to these gargoyles.
[9414.09s -> 9414.81s]  It's going to happen.
[9422.14s -> 9423.74s]  Reroll, but make everything a skeleton.
[9424.38s -> 9427.22s]  I mean, once I get sick of doing this,
[9427.94s -> 9430.18s]  we're going to throw all the dice in the air.
[9430.18s -> 9432.10s]  I'm talking every enemy pinwheel.
[9432.10s -> 9433.70s]  I'm talking only giant rats.
[9433.70s -> 9435.30s]  Like, only rats run through.
[9435.30s -> 9436.74s]  See if I can beat the game against all rats.
[9441.43s -> 9442.95s]  All right, I got to make...
[9442.95s -> 9443.83s]  I need to pull.
[9443.83s -> 9444.47s]  There we go.
[9444.47s -> 9445.03s]  Come on down.
[9445.59s -> 9446.95s]  I think I got the guy that was the...
[9446.95s -> 9447.91s]  Okay, Ornstein's down.
[9447.91s -> 9448.87s]  They're both down.
[9450.42s -> 9451.14s]  Oh, fuck.
[9451.94s -> 9452.74s]  Oh, man.
[9452.74s -> 9453.38s]  Not good.
[9453.38s -> 9454.26s]  You got to be kidding me.
[9454.26s -> 9454.74s]  This is bad.
[9456.17s -> 9457.05s]  No, I'm fucked.
[9469.93s -> 9471.29s]  I have to kill stuff.
[9471.29s -> 9472.33s]  I can't just run through this.
[9473.53s -> 9475.37s]  When people come down, they have to die.
[9476.09s -> 9478.26s]  I got to go up the stairs first,
[9479.99s -> 9482.07s]  kill the two things that are there,
[9482.07s -> 9483.43s]  and then aggro everybody down.
[9489.66s -> 9491.26s]  Every single enemy is Artorias.
[9491.82s -> 9493.70s]  Can do that.
[9507.22s -> 9508.10s]  Oh, that's a sign.
[9508.10s -> 9509.70s]  It's time for rat-only mode.
[9513.34s -> 9513.82s]  Not yet.
[9517.45s -> 9517.85s]  Okay.
[9518.65s -> 9519.53s]  Quickly go up here.
[9520.41s -> 9521.61s]  Take out these two enemies.
[9526.46s -> 9528.86s]  And when I say quickly, I mean do it quickly.
[9530.22s -> 9530.70s]  This guy...
[9531.50s -> 9538.92s]  Stupid long arms.
[9538.92s -> 9539.32s]  All right.
[9539.32s -> 9541.40s]  Now I have a straight shot.
[9542.28s -> 9544.15s]  Pull everybody down.
[9544.15s -> 9545.83s]  Watch out for this demon.
[9546.55s -> 9547.35s]  Everybody come down.
[9553.10s -> 9553.58s]  Come on.
[9553.58s -> 9554.30s]  I need Ornstein.
[9555.10s -> 9555.82s]  And there we go.
[9556.38s -> 9556.79s]  All right.
[9556.79s -> 9557.67s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[9557.67s -> 9557.91s]  You too.
[9557.91s -> 9558.39s]  I need you too.
[9558.39s -> 9559.03s]  You too, you too.
[9559.67s -> 9563.51s]  The big guy had to go down too.
[9563.51s -> 9564.15s]  I don't think he did.
[9564.15s -> 9565.03s]  No, I'm in trouble.
[9575.58s -> 9576.22s]  Oh, no.
[9579.18s -> 9580.86s]  This guy is attached to me.
[9584.36s -> 9585.96s]  They all have to come down.
[9585.96s -> 9586.52s]  All of them.
[9587.24s -> 9592.50s]  Otherwise, I can't even physically walk through the door.
[9597.32s -> 9599.08s]  It's just that stupid demon outside
[9599.08s -> 9602.52s]  that can just sweep and hit me from anywhere in the cathedral.
[9603.24s -> 9617.26s]  Do I have skulls?
[9617.26s -> 9618.94s]  I do not have any skulls, I don't think.
[9620.10s -> 9621.70s]  All items are randomized as well.
[9621.70s -> 9623.38s]  So I don't think I even have one.
[9637.85s -> 9638.81s]  Check new Londo?
[9638.81s -> 9639.53s]  Yeah, that's true.
[9640.57s -> 9642.17s]  I'm going to give this one more attempt
[9642.17s -> 9643.69s]  and then I'm going to go the other way.
[9643.69s -> 9644.89s]  I'm going to go somewhere else.
[9644.89s -> 9646.73s]  Although, is there even another way I can go right now?
[9647.69s -> 9651.99s]  I'm going to pull the ones that I know I can kill
[9652.79s -> 9654.39s]  because I keep getting screwed by the rat.
[9655.11s -> 9656.39s]  The two long-armed people.
[9663.06s -> 9666.79s]  Yeah, see, this is what's causing a problem.
[9667.35s -> 9669.11s]  I would love to see.
[9671.22s -> 9674.30s]  All right, that clears out all the shitties.
[9674.86s -> 9677.67s]  I think I'm going to pull the other shitties through the wall here
[9677.67s -> 9682.41s]  because I think there's a couple that can still make it through.
[9683.05s -> 9685.77s]  There's a rat there.
[9686.57s -> 9703.43s]  Oh, God.
[9706.36s -> 9707.40s]  Oh, my God.
[9708.20s -> 9710.02s]  That just killed me instantly.
[9710.66s -> 9715.05s]  I thought I had the right idea.
[9720.79s -> 9721.11s]  Fuck.
[9722.52s -> 9724.28s]  Oh, it's so aggravating.
[9724.28s -> 9724.68s]  Damn it.
[9725.48s -> 9729.14s]  Why did they have to kill me in one hit?
[9729.14s -> 9730.66s]  Like, does it really have to kill you instantly?
[9730.66s -> 9732.42s]  Like, you just die?
[9733.22s -> 9742.94s]  That's the most amount of damage I possibly could have taken.
[9742.94s -> 9743.66s]  Yeah, I know.
[9743.66s -> 9744.22s]  It sucks.
[9744.94s -> 9751.24s]  I'm getting up there.
[9773.51s -> 9775.03s]  Stuff everybody into a door.
[9775.03s -> 9777.11s]  I just delete the dragon.
[9777.11s -> 9778.95s]  It's the dragon that's causing the problem.
[9779.91s -> 9787.88s]  There's the rat.
[9787.88s -> 9790.41s]  There's the rat.
[9790.81s -> 9795.35s]  The dragon is making this so hellish.
[9796.54s -> 9798.54s]  If only he just wasn't in the way.
[9799.10s -> 9809.21s]  All right.
[9809.21s -> 9810.73s]  Well, I'm going to go for it.
[9810.73s -> 9816.78s]  It's important that they all come down.
[9820.82s -> 9821.94s]  One, two.
[9822.82s -> 9823.62s]  Where's Ornstein?
[9823.62s -> 9824.18s]  Come on.
[9824.18s -> 9824.42s]  Three.
[9824.42s -> 9825.22s]  I need the big guy, too.
[9825.86s -> 9826.26s]  Big guy.
[9826.26s -> 9826.50s]  Come on.
[9826.50s -> 9826.82s]  Come on.
[9826.82s -> 9827.06s]  Come on.
[9827.06s -> 9827.30s]  Go.
[9827.94s -> 9829.32s]  This is the one.
[9829.32s -> 9829.64s]  This is it.
[9829.64s -> 9829.96s]  This is it.
[9829.96s -> 9830.44s]  This is the one.
[9830.44s -> 9831.08s]  I'm going to get up there.
[9831.64s -> 9833.62s]  Just watch out here.
[9833.62s -> 9835.14s]  This is probably going to be like a rat or two.
[9842.94s -> 9844.70s]  35,000 soul.
[9845.34s -> 9848.25s]  Oh, I don't know what's following me.
[9848.25s -> 9849.93s]  They're scaring the shit out of me.
[9849.93s -> 9850.41s]  All right, I'm fine.
[9851.37s -> 9852.33s]  Taurus demon time.
[9852.33s -> 9853.13s]  Not Taurus demon time.
[9853.13s -> 9853.61s]  Gargoyles.
[9857.58s -> 9858.30s]  All right, here we go.
[9862.23s -> 9863.67s]  Please be a default enemy.
[9866.30s -> 9867.34s]  I can handle this.
[9867.34s -> 9867.98s]  I can handle this.
[9872.30s -> 9873.82s]  There's the guy in the back.
[9877.74s -> 9879.42s]  There's a guy standing in the back.
[9880.38s -> 9881.74s]  I could have done it, too.
[9881.74s -> 9882.70s]  Wow.
[9882.70s -> 9883.10s]  God.
[9883.98s -> 9885.10s]  It was the Taurus.
[9886.92s -> 9890.04s]  I was paying attention to the magician in the background.
[9891.22s -> 9891.94s]  I can do this.
[9892.58s -> 9894.02s]  It's going to be two Taurus demons.
[9894.02s -> 9894.42s]  Whatever.
[9895.38s -> 9897.64s]  Oh, I'm going to pee my pants, too.
[9897.64s -> 9898.28s]  Shit.
[9898.28s -> 9898.68s]  Whatever.
[9906.79s -> 9907.99s]  I have to get through this.
[9910.90s -> 9913.30s]  It's such a pain in the ass to get them all to follow.
[9914.26s -> 9916.71s]  Now, I need a weapon I can actually upgrade, too.
[9918.10s -> 9918.82s]  All in due time.
[9919.70s -> 9921.06s]  So many things are going to go wrong here.
[9921.70s -> 9922.20s]  You know what?
[9922.20s -> 9922.52s]  I don't care.
[9922.52s -> 9923.96s]  Just fucking come down now.
[9923.96s -> 9924.44s]  Let's go.
[9924.44s -> 9924.92s]  All of you.
[9924.92s -> 9927.35s]  Now, you're on the perfect spot.
[9927.35s -> 9928.31s]  One, two, three.
[9928.31s -> 9928.63s]  Come on.
[9928.63s -> 9929.67s]  Down, down, down, down, down.
[9929.67s -> 9930.07s]  All of you.
[9930.07s -> 9930.39s]  Everybody.
[9930.39s -> 9931.59s]  Down, down, down, down, down, down.
[9931.59s -> 9931.83s]  Good.
[9933.18s -> 9941.13s]  He just dragged across the whole game.
[9941.13s -> 9941.77s]  Oh, shit.
[9941.77s -> 9942.73s]  Don't be the wall here.
[9949.10s -> 9949.58s]  All right.
[9949.58s -> 9950.30s]  That was pretty clean.
[9952.20s -> 9953.72s]  Everything could always be better, but that was fine.
[9954.28s -> 9962.07s]  It's just a Taurus demon.
[9962.07s -> 9962.63s]  Oh, fuck.
[9964.68s -> 9966.04s]  The boogie man's coming to get me.
[9979.61s -> 9979.85s]  What?
[9982.06s -> 9982.62s]  Hold on.
[9982.62s -> 9982.86s]  What?
[9984.70s -> 9985.74s]  Is that Gwyn?
[9991.77s -> 9992.97s]  It's actually Gwyn.
[9994.49s -> 9995.37s]  He's serious.
[9998.18s -> 9998.98s]  Just let me get it.
[10016.89s -> 10017.21s]  All right.
[10017.21s -> 10019.21s]  This is possible, but it's own.
[10021.54s -> 10022.26s]  I have to.
[10023.06s -> 10024.90s]  I have to kill the Taurus demon immediately.
[10025.62s -> 10030.18s]  I have to kill.
[10030.18s -> 10031.86s]  It's going to be like four or five swings.
[10031.86s -> 10032.74s]  He has to die immediately.
[10037.35s -> 10038.87s]  And then I have to just start parrying Gwyn.
[10041.16s -> 10043.56s]  Oh, go fuck up Gwyn first because he's T-posing.
[10043.56s -> 10044.28s]  That's very.
[10044.28s -> 10045.48s]  Yeah, that's not a bad idea either.
[10063.80s -> 10067.50s]  I hope I can kill him while he's standing there.
[10075.29s -> 10075.85s]  Come on.
[10075.85s -> 10077.93s]  Two, three, four, five.
[10077.93s -> 10078.57s]  Bring him down.
[10079.21s -> 10079.45s]  Good.
[10092.70s -> 10094.14s]  You have to be sitting in the door right here.
[10096.26s -> 10097.54s]  Could you be anywhere else?
[10097.54s -> 10098.90s]  I mean, and I'm talking anywhere.
[10098.90s -> 10100.18s]  I'm talking about fucking anywhere.
[10103.58s -> 10103.90s]  This is bad.
[10104.70s -> 10108.58s]  Oh, here the dragon is.
[10110.18s -> 10112.18s]  How did you fit in here?
[10112.74s -> 10115.54s]  There's no way you can even fit up here.
[10115.54s -> 10119.78s]  And yet you walked up the stairs normally, very casually.
[10127.69s -> 10129.29s]  I'm going to try this one more time.
[10129.29s -> 10129.61s]  That's it.
[10130.33s -> 10132.73s]  And then I'm going down to like the skeleton zone.
[10133.37s -> 10148.49s]  Here comes a meltdown.
[10148.49s -> 10149.13s]  No, you can't.
[10149.13s -> 10151.53s]  There's no such thing as a meltdown on a randomizer stream.
[10161.67s -> 10162.87s]  You can't melt down here.
[10163.51s -> 10164.63s]  None of this is in my control.
[10165.43s -> 10167.88s]  Two, three, there they go.
[10167.88s -> 10168.36s]  All right, let's go.
[10168.92s -> 10179.96s]  You had to leave that one.
[10179.96s -> 10181.08s]  How dare you?
[10181.08s -> 10182.36s]  The dragon's out coming up here.
[10182.36s -> 10182.76s]  I see him.
[10182.76s -> 10183.32s]  He's making a...
[10184.20s -> 10184.52s]  What?
[10185.40s -> 10188.92s]  How the fuck did you already get up here?
[10189.96s -> 10192.04s]  Get out of my fucking way.
[10193.08s -> 10193.40s]  No.
[10197.54s -> 10201.06s]  Why do they have to take up every space?
[10208.79s -> 10210.07s]  I have to go up there.
[10210.87s -> 10233.58s]  Just skip to Blighttown with the master key.
[10236.70s -> 10238.22s]  If you kill Gwyn, you beat the game.
[10239.19s -> 10240.95s]  I'm going to try to hammer him as much as I can.
[10241.59s -> 10247.83s]  Like just...
[10247.83s -> 10249.19s]  I'm going to go kill everything first.
[10250.36s -> 10251.16s]  And then I'm going to pull it.
[10251.16s -> 10252.60s]  I'm going to do it the way that I did it before.
[10257.94s -> 10258.42s]  Come on in.
[10258.98s -> 10259.46s]  Let's go.
[10259.46s -> 10260.18s]  Like turn the corner.
[10260.18s -> 10262.02s]  You can do the same dumb thing over and over again.
[10262.90s -> 10270.52s]  Okay.
[10270.52s -> 10271.16s]  Who's next?
[10271.16s -> 10272.04s]  There's a rat too.
[10272.84s -> 10276.78s]  Anybody else fit through there?
[10278.09s -> 10278.73s]  No.
[10278.73s -> 10279.05s]  Okay.
[10280.58s -> 10281.06s]  Let's go.
[10281.70s -> 10297.06s]  Come on.
[10297.06s -> 10297.70s]  I need you to fall.
[10297.70s -> 10298.66s]  This is why I didn't...
[10298.66s -> 10300.34s]  This is why it doesn't work that well.
[10300.98s -> 10308.47s]  Slug?
[10309.03s -> 10313.16s]  I can skip the slug.
[10314.36s -> 10315.64s]  You punk.
[10315.64s -> 10316.52s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[10316.52s -> 10318.92s]  Why would you turn at that exact moment?
[10320.73s -> 10323.45s]  The exact moment that I needed to go through that door.
[10331.46s -> 10331.62s]  No.
[10331.62s -> 10332.58s]  No meltdowns.
[10332.58s -> 10333.82s]  I'm good.
[10333.82s -> 10335.02s]  I'm going to go straight through.
[10335.02s -> 10336.38s]  I'm going to try to kill Gwyn as fast as I can.
[10359.46s -> 10359.86s]  Wait.
[10359.86s -> 10360.74s]  Will he kill him?
[10363.10s -> 10363.90s]  I don't think he will.
[10377.86s -> 10378.42s]  Oh shit.
[10378.42s -> 10379.22s]  Don't activate him.
[10381.58s -> 10382.22s]  What?
[10382.22s -> 10384.34s]  What was that?
[10384.34s -> 10395.90s]  Okay.
[10395.90s -> 10396.78s]  Let's go back.
[10396.78s -> 10398.22s]  I'm trying to pull him as far away as I can.
[10399.26s -> 10400.30s]  Don't jump off the edge.
[10400.30s -> 10401.02s]  I don't want to fight him.
[10415.99s -> 10417.51s]  Cut off Gwyn's tail.
[10417.51s -> 10418.31s]  Gwyn is...
[10422.23s -> 10422.63s]  Hold on.
[10422.63s -> 10423.03s]  Hold on.
[10430.06s -> 10431.58s]  Is this actually hurting him though?
[10432.38s -> 10446.17s]  Kill the demon now.
[10446.89s -> 10458.52s]  He just killed him.
[10458.52s -> 10459.24s]  He killed him.
[10459.24s -> 10459.88s]  I didn't kill him.
[10460.44s -> 10467.66s]  Why can he not hurt me?
[10467.66s -> 10476.95s]  What?
[10476.95s -> 10477.67s]  Oh.
[10477.67s -> 10480.33s]  I...
[10480.97s -> 10483.42s]  I'm like flipping.
[10483.42s -> 10484.46s]  I can't.
[10484.46s -> 10484.78s]  Fuck.
[10487.13s -> 10488.89s]  I thought he couldn't hurt me.
[10488.89s -> 10490.01s]  He was like swinging.
[10491.11s -> 10491.99s]  Why am I parrying?
[10491.99s -> 10494.92s]  Because my brain wanted to...
[10494.92s -> 10495.56s]  I don't know.
[10496.44s -> 10497.08s]  I'm going down.
[10497.72s -> 10499.70s]  When he killed...
[10503.62s -> 10505.22s]  When he killed the Taurus demon,
[10505.22s -> 10506.10s]  it like freaked me out.
[10506.10s -> 10506.82s]  And then all of a sudden,
[10506.82s -> 10520.47s]  I get to fight the last boss in the game
[10520.47s -> 10521.59s]  on the fucking tower.
[10522.31s -> 10534.90s]  Let's go.
[10534.90s -> 10535.54s]  I'm going to go down here.
[10557.00s -> 10557.40s]  Idea.
[10557.40s -> 10558.44s]  Have the master key.
[10558.44s -> 10559.88s]  So why the hell wouldn't I just go here?
[10576.89s -> 10577.29s]  Okay.
[10577.29s -> 10582.87s]  Well, nobody seems to be doing anything.
[10582.87s -> 10584.87s]  So this is a perfect opportunity to like pick up stuff.
[10597.64s -> 10598.76s]  Go to the smith.
[10598.76s -> 10599.56s]  I can't.
[10599.56s -> 10602.20s]  I have to kill Gwyn to unlock the smith.
[10603.24s -> 10618.89s]  That's...
[10618.89s -> 10619.21s]  Isn't that...
[10619.21s -> 10620.09s]  That's a boss.
[10620.09s -> 10620.97s]  I don't want that to happen.
[10621.61s -> 10623.03s]  Wait, the smith...
[10623.03s -> 10623.59s]  The giant?
[10623.59s -> 10624.15s]  Wait.
[10624.15s -> 10625.59s]  Am I mixing three games together?
[10627.61s -> 10628.89s]  Oh, the Giants and Dark Souls 3.
[10633.69s -> 10634.89s]  What the hell is pendant?
[10634.89s -> 10645.27s]  Oh, it doesn't do anything.
[10646.23s -> 10648.98s]  Who's down there?
[10648.98s -> 10650.10s]  I don't know.
[10650.10s -> 10651.06s]  Who is any fucking idea?
[10656.95s -> 10657.67s]  Actually, no.
[10657.67s -> 10658.87s]  I know who you guys are talking about.
[10658.87s -> 10659.43s]  Yeah.
[10659.43s -> 10660.15s]  Nah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10660.15s -> 10660.87s]  This guy down here.
[10672.10s -> 10678.50s]  I still can't even upgrade this.
[10679.30s -> 10688.15s]  What do you got for items?
[10688.95s -> 10690.41s]  Murakumo.
[10690.41s -> 10695.19s]  Gauntlet of thorns.
[10704.01s -> 10705.53s]  I'm putting all my points into
[10706.17s -> 10706.65s]  strength.
[10707.53s -> 10710.34s]  The Sorcerer's Catalyst.
[10713.06s -> 10715.30s]  Why is this 500,000 sold?
[10725.22s -> 10726.42s]  Very, very rare.
[10727.54s -> 10729.96s]  I need Twinkling Titanite if I have any chance.
[10729.96s -> 10730.84s]  I already defined like a...
[10731.72s -> 10732.44s]  Buy the sword?
[10733.24s -> 10737.13s]  How much was it?
[10738.07s -> 10738.95s]  Should I get that sword?
[10738.95s -> 10739.27s]  But I...
[10739.91s -> 10740.47s]  My strength...
[10740.47s -> 10741.35s]  I have no...
[10741.35s -> 10741.83s]  I can't even...
[10748.71s -> 10749.91s]  Yeah, it does cost nothing.
[10749.91s -> 10750.71s]  You're right.
[10750.71s -> 10752.15s]  Well, here's the thing though.
[10752.79s -> 10754.42s]  I don't think I can even put it on.
[10755.06s -> 10760.04s]  I need 13 decks.
[10760.84s -> 10762.90s]  I can't even like use the damn thing.
[10763.78s -> 10772.47s]  A lot of people want me to use the Dark Hand.
[10780.92s -> 10782.76s]  But nah, this is just doing way more damage.
[10784.57s -> 10785.45s]  Use it as a shield?
[10787.27s -> 10787.99s]  All right.
[10787.99s -> 10789.03s]  Where the hell do I want to go?
[10789.91s -> 10791.77s]  Try just fight Artorias.
[10792.73s -> 10794.01s]  No, that would be a mistake.
[10800.49s -> 10801.05s]  No balls.
[10830.02s -> 10830.74s]  What?
[10830.74s -> 10831.72s]  Where is he?
[10839.83s -> 10840.47s]  Get him to fall?
[10840.47s -> 10841.03s]  That's the plan.
[10841.67s -> 10850.95s]  Crash.
[10853.91s -> 10854.63s]  It's dead.
[10854.63s -> 10863.38s]  Oh well.
[10863.38s -> 10870.92s]  Let's reroll it again.
[10870.92s -> 10871.64s]  Except this time.
[10872.98s -> 10873.46s]  I'm going...
[10874.66s -> 10876.02s]  I'm gonna go nuts here.
[10876.02s -> 10885.35s]  Let's see if I can do it.
[10885.35s -> 10886.71s]  I'm gonna do all Pinwheel.
[10886.71s -> 10896.78s]  Replace normal enemies with Pinwheel.
[10896.78s -> 10898.78s]  Replace NPCs with Pinwheel.
[10898.78s -> 10904.65s]  Let's open the config here.
[10905.51s -> 10907.99s]  Disable all and only Pinwheel.
[10908.55s -> 10910.38s]  The thing is I have to find Pinwheel.
[10910.94s -> 10916.46s]  This is gonna be the ultimate run.
[10920.52s -> 10921.40s]  Pinwheel.
[10921.40s -> 10922.12s]  Pinwheel.
[10922.12s -> 10922.68s]  Where...
[10922.68s -> 10923.24s]  Pinwheel.
[10923.24s -> 10923.80s]  There we go.
[10925.91s -> 10926.15s]  Done?
[10927.94s -> 10928.26s]  Okay.
[10941.82s -> 10946.97s]  I wonder if I can even walk like 20 feet.
[10946.97s -> 10954.71s]  This is gonna be fucking so stupid.
[10955.35s -> 10957.27s]  But that's what we're doing here, right?
[10957.27s -> 10958.23s]  That's why we're doing this.
[10958.95s -> 10966.52s]  Where am I gonna end up?
[10972.47s -> 10973.03s]  That's alright.
[10973.75s -> 10976.26s]  How scared am I?
[10977.53s -> 10977.85s]  Eh.
[10978.57s -> 10979.69s]  I think maybe like a four.
[10980.65s -> 10993.70s]  Well, one of them already died.
[10993.70s -> 10994.50s]  I didn't have to do anything.
[11000.33s -> 11001.85s]  Pinwheel, easiest boss in the game.
[11012.22s -> 11014.22s]  That's not Pinwheel, okay?
[11014.22s -> 11015.90s]  Why is that here?
[11015.90s -> 11017.02s]  That's not Pinwheel.
[11017.02s -> 11018.22s]  I selected Pinwheel.
[11020.31s -> 11021.43s]  This is not Pinwheel.
[11023.18s -> 11023.90s]  Weirdly enough.
[11030.89s -> 11033.37s]  It's all bosses, but none of them are Pinwheel.
[11040.09s -> 11041.77s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[11042.33s -> 11043.13s]  Oh god.
[11043.85s -> 11046.49s]  Why would I come to Blighttown of all places?
[11057.58s -> 11058.54s]  Look at this shit.
[11064.58s -> 11065.14s]  Jump off?
[11065.14s -> 11066.26s]  I'm not gonna jump off.
[11069.10s -> 11070.54s]  This is fucking terrible.
[11074.97s -> 11075.53s]  I don't...
[11075.53s -> 11077.21s]  Did it not save properly?
[11093.83s -> 11094.39s]  Pinwheel...
[11095.27s -> 11095.75s]  Clones...
[11096.23s -> 11105.22s]  I don't even remember how to get down.
[11107.58s -> 11108.62s]  Oh, Jesus.
[11110.31s -> 11128.95s]  Um, I haven't even collected any items.
[11128.95s -> 11130.23s]  I have so many souls.
[11138.30s -> 11138.94s]  Oh, fuck.
[11141.02s -> 11142.86s]  That was right next to my head.
[11143.58s -> 11148.07s]  Kick him off!
[11148.07s -> 11148.47s]  Kick him!
[11156.38s -> 11160.12s]  Um, um, um...
[11160.12s -> 11160.44s]  Down...
[11167.54s -> 11168.18s]  Wait.
[11168.18s -> 11176.62s]  Is this a mimic?
[11181.43s -> 11182.47s]  I can upgrade the sword.
[11189.64s -> 11190.04s]  Finally.
[11190.04s -> 11190.68s]  Thank god.
[11190.68s -> 11191.00s]  Alright.
[11191.00s -> 11193.00s]  Now, what's the safest...
[11193.00s -> 11194.92s]  There's so much going on the screen right now.
[11194.92s -> 11204.17s]  This is a bone home.
[11204.17s -> 11204.57s]  Not yet.
[11205.21s -> 11213.74s]  I am sweating right now.
[11215.02s -> 11215.34s]  Bad.
[11216.14s -> 11224.02s]  Yeah, you're right.
[11224.02s -> 11224.58s]  You're right.
[11224.58s -> 11224.98s]  You know you're right.
[11224.98s -> 11225.62s]  You guys are right.
[11225.62s -> 11226.10s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11226.10s -> 11227.14s]  Let's get out of here.
[11227.14s -> 11228.66s]  I'm gonna level off like fucking 30 times.
[11229.86s -> 11237.83s]  Okay.
[11263.05s -> 11263.37s]  No!
[11264.17s -> 11265.96s]  I fell off the shite.
[11267.10s -> 11268.14s]  That's the voice we had.
[11268.14s -> 11268.94s]  Didn't you all know it?
[11280.28s -> 11280.60s]  Okay.
[11281.24s -> 11282.10s]  What is that?
[11283.98s -> 11284.54s]  Who is that?
[11286.06s -> 11286.54s]  Found him!
[11287.26s -> 11297.58s]  Let's go, you motherfucker.
[11298.30s -> 11299.26s]  You and me!
[11299.26s -> 11308.23s]  No, no, no.
[11308.23s -> 11308.63s]  Not good.
[11313.35s -> 11313.67s]  Shit.
[11323.46s -> 11324.26s]  God!
[11324.26s -> 11328.49s]  Is she dead?
[11328.49s -> 11330.49s]  Did she fall off?
[11330.49s -> 11330.97s]  She fell off.
[11330.97s -> 11331.53s]  Okay, she fell...
[11331.53s -> 11332.33s]  It's just me and him now.
[11332.97s -> 11346.09s]  Got him.
[11346.09s -> 11346.49s]  I win.
[11360.34s -> 11360.90s]  You didn't see?
[11360.90s -> 11362.18s]  What do you mean you didn't see?
[11362.18s -> 11369.80s]  Scripted, scripted, scripted.
[11369.80s -> 11370.36s]  What do you mean?
[11370.36s -> 11371.32s]  I don't understand what you're talking about.
[11371.32s -> 11371.72s]  He's dead.
[11373.13s -> 11374.33s]  Oh, what is that?
[11374.33s -> 11378.60s]  Just do it like...
[11378.60s -> 11379.88s]  Wait, somebody's behind me.
[11379.88s -> 11380.60s]  Somebody's behind me.
[11380.60s -> 11381.48s]  Somebody's behind me.
[11381.48s -> 11382.28s]  I don't know who it is.
[11382.28s -> 11382.92s]  Can I get out?
[11387.21s -> 11387.61s]  He...
[11387.61s -> 11389.61s]  Did he follow me?
[11389.61s -> 11390.01s]  Oh, no.
[11390.01s -> 11391.77s]  It's because I hit the reset button.
[11400.92s -> 11401.96s]  Oh my god.
[11424.78s -> 11425.50s]  What?
[11425.50s -> 11426.30s]  I was behind him.
[11429.16s -> 11432.66s]  Yeah, I can almost afford that sorcerer's staff.
[11433.30s -> 11435.93s]  I'll kill him again right now.
[11436.57s -> 11438.49s]  For the doubters.
[11439.05s -> 11443.80s]  Where is he?
[11443.80s -> 11475.16s]  I'm terrified.
[11475.16s -> 11475.88s]  I can't really move.
[11481.91s -> 11482.47s]  Where's Pinwheel?
[11489.74s -> 11490.38s]  This time.
[11490.38s -> 11491.50s]  It was for real.
[11491.50s -> 11493.05s]  Where's Pinwheel?
[11499.05s -> 11499.93s]  I need to...
[11499.93s -> 11501.29s]  I'm gonna be unstoppable.
[11501.29s -> 11503.29s]  I'm gonna level up everything into strength.
[11504.01s -> 11504.65s]  Into...
[11504.65s -> 11505.85s]  I'm gonna get to 50 strength
[11505.85s -> 11506.89s]  and then all hit in hell.
[11522.15s -> 11522.55s]  God.
[11529.96s -> 11530.60s]  Just let...
[11530.60s -> 11532.04s]  I can't touch the bonfire
[11532.04s -> 11533.24s]  because he's just hanging out here.
[11534.04s -> 11554.28s]  Where is it?
[11554.84s -> 11561.16s]  What are we doing?
[11561.16s -> 11561.88s]  What?
[11561.88s -> 11562.52s]  Why would it...
[11562.52s -> 11563.72s]  Why would it highlight no?
[11564.52s -> 11565.94s]  Can anyone explain to me
[11565.94s -> 11567.30s]  when I press use item
[11567.30s -> 11568.98s]  why does it highlight no?
[11569.78s -> 11570.10s]  First.
[11570.74s -> 11572.84s]  It should highlight yes.
[11572.84s -> 11573.96s]  Why does it highlight anything?
[11574.76s -> 11590.84s]  I have to go to another bonfire.
[11590.84s -> 11592.28s]  I have to go to another...
[11592.28s -> 11592.76s]  Pinwheel.
[11593.64s -> 11593.96s]  Wait.
[11600.89s -> 11601.21s]  Got it.
[11611.10s -> 11613.42s]  I just keep spawning.
[11618.71s -> 11621.03s]  I'm just gonna keep getting free souls forever.
[11621.03s -> 11622.71s]  I'm gonna get 99 in every step.
[11629.11s -> 11629.91s]  I just keep doing it.
[11630.55s -> 11645.75s]  This is just cheating.
[11645.75s -> 11646.79s]  It's just cheating.
[11659.32s -> 11659.64s]  All right.
[11659.64s -> 11660.28s]  Up to Pinwheel.
[11660.28s -> 11660.68s]  Let's go.
[11660.68s -> 11662.12s]  This time Cox ain't gonna fuck it up.
[11682.73s -> 11683.29s]  Dad.
[11683.29s -> 11685.62s]  You saw it on camera.
[11685.62s -> 11691.46s]  What'd he drop?
[11691.46s -> 11692.02s]  He dropped something.
[11692.82s -> 11693.86s]  Pinwheel did not kill me.
[11693.86s -> 11694.98s]  This is this guy killing me.
[11711.03s -> 11711.43s]  All right.
[11711.43s -> 11713.27s]  I have to get the fuck out of this.
[11713.27s -> 11730.42s]  What is coming out of the house?
[11732.07s -> 11734.31s]  This is like being inside of a hurricane.
[11735.98s -> 11737.98s]  I'm inside the eye of a storm right now.
[11737.98s -> 11738.78s]  This is a tornado
[11738.78s -> 11740.14s]  and a hurricane going on.
[11740.14s -> 11741.42s]  This is lightning striking.
[11747.69s -> 11747.85s]  No.
[11748.41s -> 11750.17s]  This is like riding a Harry Potter ride.
[11750.17s -> 11751.61s]  I feel like I'm riding a ride
[11751.61s -> 11753.21s]  at fucking Universal Studios.
[11754.01s -> 11758.52s]  Are they killing each other?
[11759.16s -> 11772.89s]  All right.
[11772.89s -> 11773.29s]  Let's go.
[11773.29s -> 11773.85s]  RT Ice.
[11774.65s -> 11805.93s]  Are the gargoyles dead?
[11805.93s -> 11810.49s]  They just...
[11810.97s -> 11812.17s]  What is the ice?
[11813.05s -> 11815.21s]  What is causing the ice wave?
[11815.21s -> 11816.65s]  This is too much stimulation.
[11816.65s -> 11817.13s]  It really is.
[11834.52s -> 11834.84s]  Okay.
[11835.80s -> 11838.20s]  So I am now going to...
[11845.67s -> 11846.31s]  I'm laddered.
[11847.35s -> 11850.90s]  Try to get Pinwheel to work.
[11850.90s -> 11852.42s]  So what am I doing wrong?
[11852.42s -> 11854.50s]  I thought everybody was supposed to be Pinwheel.
[11875.16s -> 11886.38s]  Get me the fuck out of here.
[11887.42s -> 11888.14s]  Get me out of here.
[11890.23s -> 11891.59s]  Let's try this again.
[11892.63s -> 11897.50s]  Okay.
[11897.50s -> 11897.82s]  So.
[11905.45s -> 11905.77s]  Okay.
[11905.77s -> 11908.94s]  Disable all and then Pinwheel.
[11908.94s -> 11911.42s]  And then I guess I have to save it and then load it.
[11913.14s -> 11913.78s]  So there.
[11914.50s -> 11916.34s]  Save as Pin...
[11916.34s -> 11916.74s]  Okay.
[11916.74s -> 11917.30s]  Pinwheel.
[11917.94s -> 11919.80s]  This should do it.
[11921.08s -> 11921.32s]  Okay.
[11922.04s -> 11924.68s]  So I need to select Pinwheel.
[11925.24s -> 11930.49s]  Pinwheel is selected.
[11931.13s -> 11937.82s]  Pinwheel.
[11937.82s -> 11938.14s]  All right.
[11938.14s -> 11938.94s]  I think we got it now.
[11939.66s -> 11948.63s]  Let's try it.
[11961.00s -> 11965.16s]  Watching the Crystal Dragon just fall into the abyss and putting his hands up.
[11967.00s -> 11967.56s]  That was...
[11967.56s -> 11968.92s]  That was a highlight of the night for me.
[11970.57s -> 11970.81s]  All right.
[11970.81s -> 11971.21s]  Let's try it.
[11971.85s -> 11976.84s]  It keeps going down a roller coaster.
[11976.84s -> 11977.72s]  Like the first drop.
[11980.30s -> 11980.70s]  All right.
[11984.50s -> 11984.82s]  Please.
[11987.06s -> 11987.38s]  No.
[11987.38s -> 11988.18s]  What the fuck?
[11990.09s -> 11991.77s]  It's like they never stopped.
[11991.77s -> 11992.81s]  They never stopped.
[12014.90s -> 12015.70s]  Hold on.
[12015.70s -> 12017.27s]  Let's try it.
[12017.51s -> 12017.91s]  Hold on.
[12017.91s -> 12018.39s]  I gotta do one...
[12018.39s -> 12019.27s]  Let me try one more thing.
[12019.99s -> 12023.24s]  All right.
[12023.24s -> 12024.44s]  Let's select that.
[12024.44s -> 12025.24s]  Get that gone.
[12026.22s -> 12026.54s]  Okay.
[12027.72s -> 12028.44s]  See if this works.
[12033.51s -> 12034.47s]  Now I got it.
[12034.47s -> 12035.27s]  This will be it I think.
[12036.78s -> 12037.34s]  There we go.
[12039.11s -> 12040.31s]  Pretty sure I just did it.
[12041.27s -> 12042.87s]  If not, there's one more thing I can try.
[12042.87s -> 12044.07s]  And if not, it might...
[12044.07s -> 12045.35s]  But I don't know why it won't work.
[12065.51s -> 12066.47s]  It's just a war.
[12067.11s -> 12070.50s]  I think we got it.
[12071.22s -> 12071.70s]  All right.
[12071.70s -> 12074.34s]  So if I die one time, then that's bad for my image.
[12088.65s -> 12090.09s]  Then I have to turn the stream off.
[12091.62s -> 12091.86s]  No.
[12091.86s -> 12092.34s]  I need to...
[12092.34s -> 12092.58s]  All right.
[12092.58s -> 12092.90s]  Let's go.
[12093.54s -> 12094.50s]  Let's go down to...
[12095.54s -> 12096.74s]  Where the fuck do I even need to go?
[12096.74s -> 12100.31s]  I gotta kill the stupid Taurus...
[12100.31s -> 12100.63s]  I gotta...
[12100.63s -> 12100.79s]  No.
[12100.79s -> 12102.87s]  I gotta kill the pinwheel guardians.
[12102.87s -> 12104.47s]  The pinwheel gargoyles.
[12104.47s -> 12105.86s]  I'm just gonna...
[12105.86s -> 12106.98s]  I have to run all the way back.
[12120.09s -> 12140.62s]  Get the most important speedrun of all.
[12160.44s -> 12160.84s]  All right.
[12160.84s -> 12165.61s]  Almost there.
[12165.61s -> 12166.81s]  I'm not going to die.
[12167.61s -> 12169.69s]  It is almost impossible for me to lose this.
[12175.67s -> 12176.87s]  It's two pinwheels.
[12178.02s -> 12179.30s]  And I have 50 strength.
[12179.30s -> 12179.70s]  But I don't...
[12179.70s -> 12181.14s]  This is not even an upgraded weapon.
[12183.62s -> 12184.42s]  That's the one problem.
[12184.42s -> 12185.62s]  This is not an upgraded weapon.
[12185.62s -> 12186.98s]  Can I even climb this without getting hit?
[12191.16s -> 12191.88s]  I don't...
[12191.88s -> 12194.12s]  Guys, I may as well have one Estus.
[12194.12s -> 12196.44s]  Because I have to drink the whole thing to fill a health bar.
[12197.16s -> 12197.88s]  He's making excuses...
[12197.88s -> 12199.08s]  I am making excuses already.
[12199.72s -> 12205.62s]  All right.
[12205.62s -> 12206.02s]  Here we go.
[12213.90s -> 12214.14s]  All right.
[12214.14s -> 12216.06s]  I'm kind of freaking out because this is so...
[12216.06s -> 12217.66s]  This is so easy.
[12230.94s -> 12231.50s]  I did...
[12231.50s -> 12232.30s]  But I got a mushroom.
[12232.30s -> 12233.58s]  I just skipped it accidentally.
[12238.36s -> 12239.40s]  Ring the bell.
[12239.40s -> 12241.50s]  I'm gonna beat this whole game tonight.
[12242.14s -> 12242.94s]  What do you think about that?
[12252.06s -> 12257.18s]  By the way, here is the stipulation for the rest of this particular thing that I'm doing here.
[12257.18s -> 12258.30s]  If I die, the run's over.
[12259.18s -> 12260.70s]  Or I have to get to the end.
[12260.70s -> 12261.42s]  I have to beat the game.
[12266.87s -> 12268.47s]  You want me to start from scratch with this?
[12280.66s -> 12283.14s]  No, because everybody wants me to lose all my stats.
[12285.96s -> 12286.20s]  No.
[12288.68s -> 12289.64s]  That's not part of the deal.
[12290.20s -> 12294.26s]  All right.
[12294.26s -> 12295.22s]  Let's go down.
[12295.22s -> 12316.98s]  Get some of that new gear.
[12316.98s -> 12317.70s]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[12318.26s -> 12327.74s]  Oh, he doesn't need to just do that.
[12327.74s -> 12330.23s]  I thought he was T-posing.
[12330.23s -> 12330.55s]  All right.
[12330.55s -> 12331.03s]  Pardon me.
[12333.14s -> 12333.94s]  Request.
[12333.94s -> 12334.58s]  Absolution.
[12335.06s -> 12338.34s]  I don't have enough money.
[12338.98s -> 12347.51s]  Look at this thing.
[12347.51s -> 12348.86s]  Grant?
[12349.50s -> 12355.54s]  All this stuff is bare...
[12355.54s -> 12356.66s]  This stuff is all pretty much free.
[12386.68s -> 12387.48s]  Learn gesture.
[12388.20s -> 12388.68s]  I will.
[12390.04s -> 12390.36s]  All right.
[12390.36s -> 12391.08s]  Learn T-pose.
[12391.08s -> 12392.20s]  Now I can do it with my friends.
[12393.24s -> 12394.28s]  And I still can't do this.
[12395.32s -> 12397.16s]  Well, oh well.
[12398.92s -> 12401.54s]  You can make a new character without deleting this one.
[12401.54s -> 12402.02s]  Yeah, I can.
[12409.16s -> 12409.40s]  Pull?
[12409.40s -> 12410.12s]  What do you mean pull?
[12410.12s -> 12410.60s]  Pull, pull.
[12410.60s -> 12411.00s]  We gotta...
[12411.00s -> 12411.32s]  You wanna...
[12411.32s -> 12412.36s]  Wait, what do you mean pull?
[12413.24s -> 12415.94s]  Now let...
[12415.94s -> 12417.14s]  I'm gonna do the pull.
[12417.14s -> 12417.86s]  Let me do the pull.
[12417.86s -> 12418.34s]  It's my...
[12418.34s -> 12419.06s]  I'm gonna do the pull.
[12419.62s -> 12420.58s]  No, that pull doesn't count.
[12420.58s -> 12421.22s]  That pull...
[12421.22s -> 12421.62s]  I'll do one.
[12421.62s -> 12421.94s]  I'm gonna go...
[12421.94s -> 12422.98s]  Look, we haven't gone pee.
[12422.98s -> 12423.86s]  It's been three and a half hours.
[12423.86s -> 12424.58s]  Let's go to the bathroom.
[12427.83s -> 12429.35s]  I can keep this character.
[12443.64s -> 12444.52s]  I can keep this character.
[12448.90s -> 12449.46s]  All right, here you go.
[12450.18s -> 12456.36s]  We need some official rules.
[12456.36s -> 12458.12s]  I think you should start with normal enemies
[12458.12s -> 12460.04s]  and bosses only as pinwheel
[12460.04s -> 12461.64s]  until you ring the first bell.
[12461.64s -> 12462.76s]  Then pinwheel all.
[12462.76s -> 12464.44s]  We're gonna get like super deep with this.
[12469.88s -> 12470.12s]  All right.
[12470.12s -> 12471.00s]  Well, I'm gonna pee.
[12471.00s -> 12471.64s]  I'll be right back.
[12472.90s -> 12473.54s]  We'll see what happens.
[12597.50s -> 12597.90s]  All right.
[12599.24s -> 12600.76s]  So I'm gonna save this character.
[12600.76s -> 12602.44s]  It looks like majority has ruled here.
[12604.20s -> 12605.64s]  I'm gonna implement some rules, though.
[12606.44s -> 12612.10s]  This is gonna be some important rules.
[12615.00s -> 12616.36s]  Yes, that's exactly what it's gonna do.
[12616.36s -> 12618.44s]  Rats for enemies, pinwheel for all bosses.
[12619.00s -> 12625.66s]  I'm gonna try to beat this game as fast as I can.
[12628.52s -> 12630.28s]  By the way, I get to die three times.
[12630.28s -> 12631.08s]  I get three lives.
[12641.64s -> 12643.32s]  If I die three times before...
[12643.32s -> 12644.36s]  Okay, let's put it this way.
[12644.36s -> 12645.00s]  Hold on a second.
[12645.64s -> 12647.40s]  I'm not gonna beat the entire game
[12647.40s -> 12648.76s]  with pinwheels and rats.
[12648.76s -> 12650.87s]  That's gonna just get boring.
[12650.87s -> 12652.23s]  I have to beat three pinwheels.
[12652.23s -> 12656.89s]  I have to...
[12656.89s -> 12657.93s]  No, you only get to die once.
[12659.14s -> 12660.02s]  All right, fine.
[12660.02s -> 12661.78s]  If I die once, then it's over.
[12661.78s -> 12664.74s]  I have to beat at least three pinwheels.
[12665.46s -> 12667.27s]  All right, here we go.
[12667.27s -> 12668.23s]  Let me just save this.
[12669.11s -> 12675.16s]  Make a new character.
[12675.16s -> 12676.04s]  Put a timer on.
[12676.92s -> 12677.99s]  What do you mean?
[12677.99s -> 12679.51s]  Why do I need a timer for this?
[12679.51s -> 12680.31s]  How long do I get?
[12680.95s -> 12687.85s]  Like, guys, I don't even remember
[12687.85s -> 12689.37s]  half the ways to go in this game.
[12689.37s -> 12690.73s]  You think I'm gonna beat this whole game
[12690.73s -> 12691.61s]  in an hour or two?
[12692.17s -> 12695.51s]  All right, let's go do it.
[12699.14s -> 12699.54s]  All right.
[12702.20s -> 12705.24s]  Replace normal enemies only with normal enemies.
[12706.12s -> 12707.72s]  And then the normal enemies are gonna be rats.
[12708.36s -> 12710.04s]  Replace NPCs.
[12710.04s -> 12711.40s]  Do not replace NPCs.
[12711.40s -> 12713.24s]  Or should I replace NPCs with pinwheels?
[12718.78s -> 12720.22s]  No, do not replace NPCs.
[12722.31s -> 12723.67s]  All right, fully randomized.
[12724.76s -> 12725.64s]  They can be anywhere.
[12728.07s -> 12728.95s]  All right, this looks good.
[12728.95s -> 12730.47s]  Now I'm gonna open up the config.
[12730.47s -> 12733.11s]  Let's put on pinwheel.
[12733.99s -> 12735.91s]  And small rat, rat...
[12736.47s -> 12738.47s]  Large rat and snow rat are active.
[12749.82s -> 12750.62s]  That looks good.
[12753.40s -> 12755.08s]  All bosses are gonna be replaced with boss,
[12755.08s -> 12757.00s]  and pinwheel is the only one that's selectable,
[12757.00s -> 12757.64s]  so this should work.
[12758.28s -> 12762.52s]  Let's go.
[12763.08s -> 12775.64s]  By the way, dying to a rat does not count.
[12775.64s -> 12777.24s]  Dying to a pinwheel ends the whole run.
[12785.83s -> 12789.43s]  And I may, I may need to...
[12789.43s -> 12789.91s]  It depends.
[12789.91s -> 12790.71s]  Let's see.
[12790.71s -> 12794.06s]  It depends on if a new character is a random roll
[12794.06s -> 12795.58s]  or if it's all the same random.
[12796.94s -> 12797.58s]  Let's find out.
[12798.71s -> 12800.23s]  I might start with the same equipment.
[12805.91s -> 12806.79s]  Yeah, let's see.
[12806.79s -> 12807.75s]  I'm gonna have to change equipment.
[12823.74s -> 12824.30s]  Pinhead.
[12825.26s -> 12826.30s]  Pinhead is pretty good.
[12827.10s -> 12839.00s]  I'm gonna be knight.
[12842.23s -> 12843.35s]  You have to pick the class?
[12843.35s -> 12844.39s]  Deprived.
[12844.39s -> 12850.34s]  Why do you guys get to pick?
[12850.90s -> 12864.38s]  A hair.
[12864.38s -> 12866.06s]  I don't know, let me go to customize.
[12867.10s -> 12876.62s]  All right, that's fine.
[12887.38s -> 12889.72s]  Here it goes.
[12891.72s -> 12892.52s]  Rat!
[12892.52s -> 12895.66s]  That's not a rat.
[12898.10s -> 12898.82s]  What the fuck is that?
[12901.62s -> 12913.14s]  It's not a rat?
[12916.55s -> 12917.91s]  Why are they all these...
[12917.91s -> 12919.19s]  Why is this happening?
[12919.19s -> 12934.41s]  Let me see.
[12934.41s -> 12935.45s]  Did I have something wrong here?
[12936.57s -> 12936.97s]  Shouldn't be.
[12939.80s -> 12940.44s]  It's on...
[12940.44s -> 12942.20s]  The profile is set to...
[12945.05s -> 12946.41s]  It's on pinwheel.
[12947.13s -> 12952.58s]  Pinwheel.
[12953.22s -> 12954.58s]  It's selected, okay.
[12954.58s -> 12957.70s]  That's rat, small rat, snow rat, and then pinwheel and that's it.
[12958.26s -> 12958.90s]  It's selected.
[12959.54s -> 12966.25s]  So that should be fine.
[12967.21s -> 12973.32s]  Hmm.
[12973.32s -> 12982.17s]  Replace normal enemies only with normal enemies.
[12982.81s -> 12988.04s]  Replace bosses with bosses and I have them selected.
[12988.68s -> 12997.21s]  Is the beginning just an exception?
[12997.21s -> 12997.77s]  It might be.
[12999.50s -> 12999.98s]  Hold on.
[13004.92s -> 13005.80s]  All right, here we go.
[13005.80s -> 13006.84s]  This is probably what's going on.
[13012.73s -> 13014.49s]  Enemy boss can be placed anywhere in the world.
[13014.49s -> 13017.05s]  Yes, you can find things like madness in the asylum.
[13017.05s -> 13017.29s]  Okay.
[13017.85s -> 13019.85s]  I think I had like a little lock on it.
[13019.85s -> 13020.97s]  Let's try it.
[13021.61s -> 13032.23s]  Okay.
[13032.23s -> 13036.30s]  And I'm on pinwheel config.
[13037.34s -> 13041.38s]  Should do it.
[13041.38s -> 13041.78s]  Let's go.
[13046.28s -> 13048.68s]  If this doesn't work, then I'm not sure what else to do.
[13049.40s -> 13055.80s]  We might have to just go back to the other file and say sorry.
[13057.24s -> 13061.06s]  You got a 300 word essay due tomorrow.
[13061.86s -> 13064.10s]  Dude, get on that.
[13064.10s -> 13064.74s]  What are you doing here?
[13065.70s -> 13068.60s]  It worked.
[13068.60s -> 13069.32s]  All right, we're good.
[13070.12s -> 13072.98s]  So begins the run.
[13073.70s -> 13077.51s]  300 word...
[13077.51s -> 13077.91s]  That's not...
[13077.91s -> 13078.63s]  Yeah, that's like...
[13079.27s -> 13084.39s]  You've probably written more words in chat today than you will for your essay.
[13084.95s -> 13095.58s]  Will I do you math homework?
[13095.58s -> 13096.06s]  Yeah, what is it?
[13096.70s -> 13099.78s]  Give me a problem.
[13100.50s -> 13104.98s]  There he is.
[13104.98s -> 13105.62s]  He's already up there.
[13105.62s -> 13106.10s]  I see him.
[13111.88s -> 13112.36s]  See ya.
[13113.08s -> 13120.55s]  It's a 2016 meme.
[13121.19s -> 13125.48s]  Am I really getting grabbed by old 2016 meme?
[13125.48s -> 13126.36s]  Is that happening to me?
[13127.16s -> 13136.18s]  Got the hammer.
[13136.74s -> 13138.22s]  All right, let's go.
[13139.10s -> 13146.74s]  Blood shield.
[13146.74s -> 13147.62s]  What does a blood shield do?
[13148.58s -> 13151.51s]  All right, let's go.
[13151.51s -> 13152.71s]  Kill the first pinwheel.
[13153.67s -> 13163.37s]  Gives resistance.
[13163.37s -> 13163.85s]  Oh, I see.
[13174.84s -> 13175.08s]  Thanks.
[13175.72s -> 13185.56s]  This is going to be actually pretty easy.
[13186.84s -> 13191.42s]  The only thing I have to worry about is the first two pinwheels are going to be hard
[13191.42s -> 13191.90s]  because...
[13193.02s -> 13197.02s]  Why is he up here now?
[13197.02s -> 13198.66s]  He shouldn't be up here now.
[13204.86s -> 13207.42s]  Yeah, the first two pinwheels are going to be hard because I have no stats.
[13208.14s -> 13215.85s]  Where's his health bar?
[13216.41s -> 13217.69s]  Oh, he doesn't even exist yet.
[13217.69s -> 13218.01s]  I have to...
[13218.01s -> 13218.33s]  Hold on.
[13218.89s -> 13226.10s]  Where'd he go?
[13226.10s -> 13232.44s]  This is just going to hurt me.
[13243.48s -> 13245.00s]  All right, here we go.
[13252.07s -> 13253.27s]  I thought that was going to hit me.
[13253.99s -> 13273.16s]  He's stuck.
[13273.16s -> 13274.20s]  He's stuck in a time loop.
[13274.20s -> 13274.68s]  I can kill him.
[13279.16s -> 13280.28s]  He's so fucked up.
[13282.28s -> 13283.32s]  First pinwheel down.
[13285.56s -> 13287.40s]  The first of at least two.
[13288.12s -> 13293.85s]  Take the humanity.
[13293.85s -> 13294.17s]  Thank you.
[13295.77s -> 13296.97s]  Level one, one.
[13297.69s -> 13306.50s]  Hold on.
[13306.50s -> 13307.14s]  Give me a second.
[13307.94s -> 13309.70s]  I have to be right back real quick.
[13309.70s -> 13312.55s]  I got to talk to Kim about something very quickly.
[13312.55s -> 13313.59s]  I'll be right back.
[13313.59s -> 13399.16s]  All right, we're good.
[13399.16s -> 13399.80s]  Sorry about that.
[13401.91s -> 13403.11s]  We're good.
[13405.78s -> 13407.30s]  Weirdly enough, for some reason,
[13407.46s -> 13417.03s]  uh, the ceiling light in our bedroom like crashed just fell down.
[13417.03s -> 13417.51s]  I don't know how.
[13418.73s -> 13419.77s]  So everything's fine.
[13419.77s -> 13423.46s]  It just don't ask me how that happened.
[13423.46s -> 13424.26s]  A fucking ghost.
[13428.30s -> 13429.42s]  Uh, yeah, I'll put those on.
[13430.38s -> 13432.68s]  Is the eagle shield better?
[13433.32s -> 13436.95s]  What was that?
[13436.95s -> 13442.76s]  Somebody's shooting at me?
[13443.32s -> 13447.82s]  Whatever, let's go.
[13447.82s -> 13448.70s]  All right, speed run time.
[13448.70s -> 13454.87s]  Let's hurry.
[13454.87s -> 13457.03s]  Oh, it's the pinwheel that's downstairs.
[13460.74s -> 13461.30s]  This should...
[13461.86s -> 13462.58s]  Actually, you know what?
[13463.40s -> 13465.08s]  I will beat this tonight.
[13465.24s -> 13466.76s]  I'm going to beat the whole game tonight.
[13466.76s -> 13467.72s]  You know why that is?
[13467.72s -> 13479.86s]  Because I'm simply just going to run to every pinwheel.
[13479.86s -> 13481.62s]  This is not going to take more than like 30 minutes.
[13487.16s -> 13489.40s]  All these items are in the same spot, though.
[13489.40s -> 13491.56s]  That's the only problem here.
[13492.36s -> 13493.08s]  All right, what?
[13493.08s -> 13493.72s]  Doesn't matter.
[13493.72s -> 13494.04s]  I'm going.
[13494.04s -> 13494.52s]  Let's go.
[13494.52s -> 13495.16s]  Go, hurry up.
[13498.60s -> 13499.80s]  30 minutes on no balls.
[13499.80s -> 13500.52s]  Time it.
[13500.52s -> 13500.76s]  Fine.
[13501.56s -> 13515.59s]  How do I do that?
[13515.59s -> 13520.81s]  I don't think I can add one.
[13521.37s -> 13533.34s]  Here we go.
[13533.34s -> 13534.62s]  I got one.
[13534.62s -> 13546.79s]  So I got, uh, let's say one hour.
[13546.79s -> 13549.61s]  This should do it.
[13549.61s -> 13550.49s]  I said 30 minutes.
[13551.29s -> 13551.93s]  That's too bad.
[13552.73s -> 13553.53s]  One hour.
[13553.53s -> 13560.42s]  If I don't beat this in an hour, then I have lost a pinwheel.
[13560.42s -> 13561.70s]  I will accept it.
[13561.70s -> 13565.38s]  But I'm just going to literally jump down the hole and kill like the speedrun strategy.
[13565.94s -> 13569.30s]  All right, here we go.
[13569.30s -> 13570.50s]  Let me add this source.
[13571.14s -> 13576.74s]  Where is it?
[13581.66s -> 13595.06s]  I need this to be in Chrome because Firefox can't be pulled.
[13595.06s -> 13595.54s]  I forgot.
[13600.65s -> 13601.93s]  Cane and lynch rules.
[13601.93s -> 13604.49s]  No, I'm not doing a cane and lynch rule set here.
[13605.13s -> 13607.10s]  I'm doing one hour.
[13607.74s -> 13608.22s]  How about this?
[13608.22s -> 13611.50s]  Okay, if I kill at least five pinwheels in an hour, I win.
[13611.50s -> 13627.48s]  I might not even be able to get all the way through.
[13627.48s -> 13629.32s]  It's pretty possible that I might not do this at all.
[13629.88s -> 13654.49s]  Pinwheel percent.
[13654.49s -> 13655.85s]  All right, let's get this a little smaller.
[13656.49s -> 13658.52s]  All right, you ready?
[13663.34s -> 13698.25s]  In three, two, one, go.
[13698.25s -> 13701.29s]  All right, can I make the, can I make the rats smaller?
[13701.29s -> 13703.02s]  This is not fair.
[13703.02s -> 13706.92s]  They take up so much space.
[13707.80s -> 13708.84s]  That doesn't count.
[13709.96s -> 13710.76s]  That doesn't count.
[13710.76s -> 13711.48s]  It really doesn't.
[13719.64s -> 13721.80s]  I can die to it as many times as I want to a rat.
[13731.27s -> 13732.95s]  They're really just going to blow this whole thing.
[13734.17s -> 13735.37s]  Oh, god damn it.
[13737.26s -> 13738.14s]  Bye, all of you.
[13738.14s -> 13738.94s]  Okay, what's this item?
[13739.74s -> 13751.10s]  Five pinwheels, right?
[13751.10s -> 13752.14s]  That's all I need.
[13752.14s -> 13764.62s]  What do you mean no?
[13764.62s -> 13769.05s]  Why does this one have like rot all over it?
[13769.05s -> 13770.86s]  Is this a pig?
[13770.86s -> 13771.58s]  This is not even a rat.
[13771.58s -> 13772.06s]  This is a pig.
[13772.78s -> 13779.35s]  Nice random items.
[13779.35s -> 13779.83s]  More shit.
[13797.08s -> 13798.28s]  These are just a nuisance.
[13798.28s -> 13801.32s]  I've come to, that did so much fucking damage.
[13801.32s -> 13802.60s]  It's unbelievable.
[13802.60s -> 13805.38s]  I, can I get rid of the rats?
[13805.38s -> 13807.14s]  Can I please get rid of the snow rat
[13807.14s -> 13808.50s]  that does all your health in one hit?
[13822.09s -> 13823.37s]  No, I can do five.
[13841.16s -> 13855.37s]  Take off the leg armor, recall.
[13855.37s -> 13856.41s]  Leave these things alone.
[13856.41s -> 13857.77s]  They do so much damage.
[13857.77s -> 13868.22s]  The rats are harder than pinwheel.
[13868.22s -> 13870.07s]  I'm going to lose again.
[13870.07s -> 13872.89s]  I'm going to get hit again.
[13872.89s -> 13873.85s]  This is such a mess.
[13874.73s -> 13881.67s]  Because then he's going to stuff his face over here and die.
[13882.73s -> 13883.93s]  Oh, he fell off the edge.
[13888.30s -> 13890.30s]  Guys, it's fucking stupid.
[13890.94s -> 13891.98s]  I can't even move.
[13892.78s -> 13905.22s]  I would have had this better off all of them being pinwheel.
[13905.86s -> 13920.89s]  Give me the item.
[13920.89s -> 13921.77s]  Just dropped an item.
[13921.77s -> 13922.89s]  You rolled all the way.
[13922.89s -> 13924.09s]  You can't be serious.
[13924.65s -> 13927.75s]  Make them all small rats.
[13927.75s -> 13928.63s]  Yeah, can I make them all?
[13929.78s -> 13931.06s]  If I can't get up there again, I don't care.
[13931.06s -> 13931.38s]  I'm doing it.
[13931.38s -> 13932.50s]  I'm making them all small rats.
[13951.48s -> 13952.52s]  Pickaxe, nice.
[13952.52s -> 13969.26s]  What's the timer for?
[13969.26s -> 13970.54s]  Uh, for me to beat the game.
[13970.54s -> 13974.26s]  Me beating the game is killing pinwheel five times.
[13974.26s -> 13982.17s]  I've already done it once, so four more times.
[13982.17s -> 13983.53s]  This time I'm going to be ready.
[13983.53s -> 13986.65s]  Because these people, the guy, they aggro from over here.
[13987.29s -> 13988.25s]  Just wait it out.
[14016.04s -> 14016.60s]  Fuck it, just go.
[14021.67s -> 14022.23s]  Seriously.
[14039.53s -> 14041.05s]  All right, I got the first bonfire.
[14041.69s -> 14044.39s]  Touch it.
[14044.39s -> 14047.53s]  Just let him in.
[14047.53s -> 14049.13s]  I can't, that's not going to happen.
[14049.13s -> 14051.38s]  What do I want to do?
[14051.38s -> 14093.82s]  Uh, it doesn't count if I die to rats.
[14093.82s -> 14104.62s]  You can't help it.
[14104.62s -> 14106.22s]  Get out of the way.
[14106.22s -> 14110.47s]  Please leave me the fuck alone.
[14114.78s -> 14115.28s]  No.
[14116.73s -> 14118.25s]  They're just obstacles.
[14119.61s -> 14120.57s]  They don't even attack.
[14120.57s -> 14123.93s]  The giant rats are just fucking annoying obstacles.
[14123.93s -> 14124.41s]  I'm dead.
[14125.21s -> 14152.46s]  Get over here, you motherfucker.
[14153.26s -> 14162.38s]  The snow rats are actually later game enemies.
[14163.34s -> 14164.14s]  What was I thinking?
[14164.94s -> 14177.77s]  Okay, give me.
[14179.59s -> 14182.73s]  You actually attacked this time.
[14183.45s -> 14209.35s]  I can skip a bunch of that shit.
[14209.35s -> 14211.99s]  I just skipped like, I skipped like fucking 20% of the game.
[14212.63s -> 14236.34s]  Okay, just, just go.
[14236.34s -> 14242.46s]  How much time?
[14242.46s -> 14250.74s]  50 minutes?
[14250.74s -> 14251.54s]  I want to get up there.
[14251.54s -> 14253.14s]  No, don't even, just go.
[14253.14s -> 14254.50s]  Pinwheel is the easiest thing in the game.
[14254.50s -> 14255.78s]  It's almost impossible to lose.
[14256.58s -> 14258.02s]  I just have to get through the rats.
[14265.14s -> 14265.94s]  Somebody do it.
[14268.55s -> 14269.91s]  My fucking god.
[14293.14s -> 14299.82s]  There he is, pinwheel number two.
[14299.82s -> 14300.32s]  Come here.
[14304.58s -> 14306.02s]  I teleported all the way back here?
[14307.72s -> 14309.48s]  Oh shit, I forgot about the rats.
[14310.04s -> 14314.38s]  That's like the fucking real bots.
[14317.48s -> 14318.52s]  Watch out for the fireball.
[14319.32s -> 14365.05s]  I need, I need to, I'm just doing all endurance.
[14365.05s -> 14371.06s]  On to the gargoyles.
[14371.06s -> 14380.58s]  Sometimes they drop an item.
[14380.58s -> 14381.06s]  Okay, let's go.
[14381.70s -> 14398.79s]  I have to beat the whole game.
[14399.75s -> 14413.91s]  I'm working on it.
[14413.91s -> 14415.27s]  It's, it's going to be pinwheel, right?
[14420.42s -> 14421.70s]  Pinwheel is just going to be hanging out up top?
[14427.66s -> 14428.86s]  Yep, he's just hanging out up there.
[14430.65s -> 14431.45s]  Sorcerer's Cloak.
[14453.94s -> 14454.44s]  Die.
[14454.90s -> 14466.49s]  Another pickaxe.
[14466.49s -> 14469.37s]  You're doing speedrun prevention tactics.
[14469.37s -> 14470.09s]  Oh, I'm aware.
[14471.05s -> 14473.43s]  Uh, strength and dex.
[14473.43s -> 14473.91s]  Which one?
[14473.91s -> 14474.41s]  Strength.
[14474.95s -> 14478.36s]  I need to be doing, I need to do a little bit more damage.
[14478.36s -> 14490.63s]  I need, um, what's with all the dumb shit stuff?
[14490.63s -> 14491.27s]  This is boring.
[14492.36s -> 14493.48s]  I want items.
[14493.48s -> 14494.12s]  Whatever, run.
[14494.92s -> 14501.88s]  40, 46 minutes?
[14502.52s -> 14524.38s]  Why would I ever select to have big rats?
[14525.18s -> 14530.94s]  Looking for items.
[14533.24s -> 14534.12s]  No, fuck the rats.
[14534.76s -> 14536.58s]  Just get the items and run.
[14543.77s -> 14544.49s]  Chain leggings.
[14545.13s -> 14549.46s]  That may have been a mistake.
[14550.42s -> 14551.46s]  Willard just showed up.
[14554.55s -> 14555.67s]  Oh, god damn it.
[14557.74s -> 14558.54s]  Please, no.
[14559.34s -> 14561.98s]  No, he's going to fill the door, isn't he?
[14562.62s -> 14568.60s]  I thought he was going to run right into the door.
[14589.22s -> 14591.54s]  Just try to block my screen.
[14592.42s -> 14616.71s]  Oh, no, it's king rat.
[14616.71s -> 14618.07s]  They're fucking everywhere, man.
[14619.67s -> 14621.83s]  I, I, I'm going to give it the shortcut.
[14622.39s -> 14623.90s]  I'm going to need it.
[14623.90s -> 14639.66s]  I know this is a waste of time, but I want to, I can just skip it.
[14639.66s -> 14670.01s]  Let's go.
[14670.01s -> 14670.57s]  Left close.
[14676.18s -> 14678.50s]  You have to beat actual pinwheel last.
[14678.50s -> 14679.46s]  That's not part of the deal.
[14685.69s -> 14686.97s]  Your goal is five pinwheels.
[14686.97s -> 14691.93s]  So if you fight the rat goils and go below the blacks, but that's all five.
[14692.65s -> 14695.72s]  I need that master key.
[14695.72s -> 14696.52s]  Oh, shit.
[14699.32s -> 14699.88s]  I'll get it later.
[14700.52s -> 14702.89s]  I don't have time for that.
[14723.69s -> 14726.25s]  Oh, oh, no, they fill in the doors.
[14732.81s -> 14734.65s]  The rats were the worst decision.
[14736.09s -> 14737.77s]  I think the rats may be the worst decision.
[14745.13s -> 14745.69s]  Impossible.
[14746.41s -> 14747.05s]  This is impossible.
[14747.99s -> 14749.43s]  Whatever this item is, just what is it?
[14749.43s -> 14749.93s]  Sorcery.
[14758.22s -> 14761.10s]  I have to clear this whole room of rats because the giant rats
[14761.90s -> 14764.54s]  are going to make it impossible for me to run fast.
[14765.18s -> 14776.07s]  I need more strength.
[14776.71s -> 14784.58s]  That was just a drop in the bucket right there.
[14784.58s -> 14785.14s]  What do I need?
[14788.47s -> 14789.75s]  24 and 13.
[14789.75s -> 14791.03s]  24, 24 strength.
[14791.03s -> 14791.75s]  I can, I can do that.
[14800.97s -> 14802.25s]  What a great speed run.
[14802.25s -> 14802.73s]  Yeah.
[14802.73s -> 14804.25s]  Oh, good speed run.
[14804.25s -> 14805.21s]  Saving frames here.
[14805.93s -> 14842.98s]  Master key.
[14842.98s -> 14844.34s]  What the fuck just happened?
[14845.83s -> 14846.87s]  I hate this.
[14846.87s -> 14847.83s]  Why did that happen?
[14847.83s -> 14849.67s]  I just bumped my head and fell backwards.
[14852.92s -> 14854.12s]  I don't know why that happened.
[14856.22s -> 14857.74s]  It bounced me backwards.
[14858.30s -> 14859.74s]  Why did that happen?
[14862.95s -> 14864.47s]  It doesn't even make any sense.
[14865.11s -> 14866.87s]  You couldn't do that if you all,
[14866.87s -> 14868.55s]  if you all loaded up Dark Souls right now
[14868.55s -> 14870.31s]  and tried to just do what I did.
[14871.11s -> 14872.15s]  It wouldn't be possible.
[14884.95s -> 14886.15s]  My hand fucking slipped.
[14886.15s -> 14886.95s]  This is what I wanted to do.
[14886.95s -> 14887.91s]  I forgot about these items.
[14888.47s -> 14896.98s]  There's my strength.
[14897.62s -> 14903.99s]  Okay, go.
[14903.99s -> 14918.42s]  Okay, let me go back around.
[14919.14s -> 14931.82s]  Break the soul.
[14931.82s -> 14943.69s]  Get the strength.
[14943.69s -> 14944.73s]  Optimal route.
[14944.73s -> 14945.13s]  It's all right.
[14945.13s -> 14945.77s]  I'm good.
[14945.77s -> 14955.75s]  I'm gonna need two.
[14956.63s -> 14967.72s]  I need more than that.
[14968.44s -> 14979.40s]  What happened? 38 minutes?
[14979.40s -> 14986.04s]  Uh, I'd lose.
[14986.04s -> 14988.84s]  I have to clear the rats though.
[14988.84s -> 14989.64s]  Use my souls.
[14990.28s -> 14991.88s]  What do you, what do you mean?
[14992.44s -> 14999.06s]  I don't have to, I gotta go.
[14999.06s -> 14999.78s]  I don't have time for this.
[14999.78s -> 15000.18s]  I gotta go.
[15000.18s -> 15001.30s]  I, there's just no time for this shit.
[15007.70s -> 15008.42s]  Use the greatsword.
[15008.42s -> 15009.22s]  I'm using the axe.
[15009.22s -> 15016.89s]  Because this has a, uh, how about this?
[15016.89s -> 15017.85s]  Will this be good?
[15017.85s -> 15036.34s]  It's one hit.
[15036.34s -> 15036.90s]  Okay.
[15036.90s -> 15038.02s]  That's pretty great actually.
[15038.02s -> 15038.34s]  Let's go.
[15071.02s -> 15072.14s]  Dark Hand doesn't have enough,
[15072.14s -> 15073.66s]  they're all stuffing through here.
[15073.66s -> 15086.86s]  This is fucking hell.
[15092.98s -> 15094.66s]  They're just gonna chase me up the stairs, guys.
[15099.35s -> 15101.35s]  I don't, I hate the rats.
[15102.15s -> 15103.99s]  They're ruining this whole thing.
[15103.99s -> 15119.32s]  It's just, it's these snow rats.
[15119.32s -> 15122.04s]  They're like fucking DLC rats.
[15122.04s -> 15123.88s]  And they're killing this run.
[15123.88s -> 15134.50s]  I knew they were behind me.
[15134.50s -> 15134.98s]  I knew it.
[15134.98s -> 15136.42s]  Look at how many snow rats.
[15136.42s -> 15137.38s]  It's not even fair.
[15137.94s -> 15139.14s]  There's too many snow rats.
[15139.70s -> 15158.10s]  And pinwheel is like, I could,
[15158.10s -> 15159.86s]  I could close my eyes and take a bath.
[15161.67s -> 15163.51s]  It's these dumb snow rats that I put in.
[15179.83s -> 15180.39s]  Do something.
[15187.37s -> 15188.49s]  I'm gonna have a lot of shit.
[15189.13s -> 15193.50s]  All right, time?
[15193.50s -> 15194.14s]  34 minutes.
[15194.78s -> 15212.47s]  I'm almost halfway done with the game.
[15221.67s -> 15224.55s]  I get to add like 30 seconds to the time because of the cutscene.
[15224.55s -> 15235.46s]  I know I can skip, but I want to see this.
[15235.46s -> 15242.94s]  Is that his teeth?
[15242.94s -> 15259.59s]  That's his insides.
[15259.59s -> 15261.59s]  Yeah, I think that's his intestines or something.
[15280.38s -> 15281.02s]  Not today.
[15285.59s -> 15286.09s]  Uh-oh.
[15287.08s -> 15287.58s]  Uh-oh.
[15298.06s -> 15299.34s]  I gotta stop panicking right now.
[15299.34s -> 15301.02s]  I'm like freaking out because
[15301.02s -> 15302.14s]  everyone's laughing in the chat.
[15302.14s -> 15303.42s]  I can feel you laughing at me.
[15332.38s -> 15333.66s]  He's really close to the edge though,
[15333.66s -> 15334.78s]  and I don't want to go over there.
[15334.78s -> 15336.17s]  I'm gonna wait till he disappears.
[15336.17s -> 15336.97s]  I'm gonna kick him off the edge.
[15337.77s -> 15338.65s]  Will he fall off the edge?
[15339.37s -> 15341.71s]  Please.
[15342.25s -> 15353.03s]  Just kill the motherfucker.
[15367.43s -> 15374.14s]  How did that miss?
[15374.14s -> 15374.86s]  I'm good.
[15374.86s -> 15375.42s]  Everything.
[15375.42s -> 15376.30s]  Don't worry about me.
[15377.02s -> 15381.32s]  Ring the bell.
[15381.32s -> 15386.30s]  It's Twin Humanities.
[15386.30s -> 15387.04s]  That's it.
[15387.58s -> 15407.42s]  Go 10 flasks is what it took.
[15407.42s -> 15408.86s]  Blame the rats for that shit.
[15408.86s -> 15409.82s]  That's not my fault.
[15419.34s -> 15422.14s]  So what's the fastest way to me to get to the end of the game?
[15422.14s -> 15423.26s]  Like to win.
[15423.26s -> 15434.44s]  Oh wait, what am I doing?
[15434.44s -> 15434.92s]  What am I doing?
[15434.92s -> 15435.48s]  Why am I doing this?
[15440.18s -> 15441.22s]  Nah, I didn't want to use that.
[15441.78s -> 15445.05s]  Do the Sen's Fortress skip?
[15445.05s -> 15445.93s]  How do I do that?
[15445.93s -> 15460.79s]  Is it enough to do two-handed?
[15461.27s -> 15466.18s]  What do I need for two-handed?
[15472.41s -> 15473.93s]  I need those two decks.
[15473.93s -> 15474.25s]  Shit.
[15474.81s -> 15483.66s]  I'm using the crystal.
[15483.66s -> 15483.98s]  All right.
[15483.98s -> 15485.18s]  How do I do Sen's skip?
[15485.82s -> 15493.42s]  No, I seriously can't.
[15493.42s -> 15493.98s]  I don't know.
[15497.82s -> 15498.94s]  I can't do it.
[15498.94s -> 15501.69s]  Let's go.
[15501.69s -> 15507.45s]  All right, now I have to go back here and then down.
[15508.01s -> 15511.22s]  I gotta go.
[15511.22s -> 15513.46s]  No, I gotta go through with that.
[15513.46s -> 15514.90s]  I need that basement key.
[15515.62s -> 15523.74s]  Yeah, I gotta go to Blight Town.
[15523.74s -> 15535.91s]  I need to get that master key right now.
[15535.91s -> 15536.87s]  Go get it.
[15536.87s -> 15545.75s]  Do the Underground Asylum pinwheel?
[15545.75s -> 15546.95s]  No, no, no, no.
[15546.95s -> 15547.91s]  That's optional.
[15547.91s -> 15550.95s]  I gotta get the master key
[15550.95s -> 15553.11s]  and then I gotta go open the door and then go to Blight Town.
[15553.75s -> 15574.81s]  All right, let's go.
[15574.81s -> 15581.38s]  Whatever the fuck this is, let's get it too.
[15587.21s -> 15588.73s]  Can you give us a Monka S?
[15589.45s -> 15591.05s]  Not unless it's warranted.
[15600.17s -> 15607.50s]  All right, now we gotta go down from the...
[15608.06s -> 15609.66s]  Everything's fucking up in my brain
[15609.66s -> 15610.62s]  because of the dumb timer.
[15610.62s -> 15614.14s]  I have to go up to the blacksmith.
[15614.86s -> 15618.15s]  No, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[15618.79s -> 15631.34s]  What are you...
[15631.34s -> 15649.42s]  What is he doing here?
[15649.42s -> 15651.10s]  Where was the favor of protection?
[15652.94s -> 15654.94s]  It's in the same spot where it was last time.
[15654.94s -> 15672.39s]  I have to kill that fucking asshole.
[15672.39s -> 15672.89s]  Sorry.
[15673.43s -> 15681.66s]  Yeah, I don't have time for it, you're right.
[15681.66s -> 15685.98s]  All right, let's go here through Blight Town.
[15686.86s -> 15688.30s]  Well, isn't there a way that you can jump
[15688.30s -> 15689.58s]  across the whole thing in Blight Town?
[15696.76s -> 15697.72s]  I don't know where the hell it is.
[15697.72s -> 15698.20s]  I don't remember.
[15710.49s -> 15712.01s]  You fall and then exit game.
[15712.01s -> 15712.89s]  Is that what you really do?
[15720.17s -> 15721.37s]  Like, jump all the way down there.
[15723.59s -> 15725.03s]  Is that actually how I do this?
[15725.59s -> 15746.01s]  Let me go.
[15746.01s -> 15749.14s]  So fall off here and then exit the game.
[15750.81s -> 15751.53s]  Is that true?
[15756.17s -> 15757.29s]  When do I have to exit the game?
[15772.60s -> 15773.32s]  I forgot.
[15774.28s -> 15778.84s]  Everything requires a confirmation in Dark Souls.
[15778.84s -> 15780.10s]  Quit the game.
[15780.10s -> 15780.74s]  Are you sure?
[15781.38s -> 15783.62s]  Windows user authorization services.
[15783.62s -> 15785.22s]  Are you sure you want to open that program?
[15803.82s -> 15806.38s]  So you do quit game and right before you die.
[15814.28s -> 15818.94s]  So you like land quit, but you can't be dead.
[15819.50s -> 15825.03s]  I don't have time for this.
[15825.03s -> 15825.75s]  You'll fuck it up again.
[15825.75s -> 15827.35s]  All right, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[15827.91s -> 15828.63s]  I'm just gonna go down.
[15828.63s -> 15829.99s]  I'm gonna try to go down swiftly.
[15830.63s -> 15836.68s]  It's at any point during the fall.
[15836.68s -> 15838.68s]  You have to quit as soon as you hear the scream.
[15839.88s -> 15855.75s]  They're lying.
[15855.75s -> 15856.47s]  He's lying.
[15857.11s -> 15859.91s]  I'm just gonna quickly get down.
[15859.91s -> 15866.62s]  You dumbass snow rat shitheads.
[15867.58s -> 15868.22s]  Leave me alone.
[15869.18s -> 15870.14s]  All right, quickly.
[15870.14s -> 15870.54s]  Let's go.
[15871.34s -> 15890.94s]  How do you speed through Blight Town?
[15890.94s -> 15893.70s]  You just like walk across.
[15893.70s -> 15895.30s]  And there's giant rats here too.
[15895.30s -> 15896.42s]  This is such a mistake.
[15897.78s -> 15898.90s]  Can I go across that?
[15898.90s -> 15900.58s]  No, I have to go down again and then across.
[15901.78s -> 15923.18s]  Hold circle.
[15923.18s -> 15924.14s]  Yeah, I'm holding circle.
[15924.14s -> 15925.10s]  I don't know why it's not doing it.
[15925.74s -> 15927.77s]  I'm like holding down circle.
[15928.49s -> 15931.05s]  Or B, whatever.
[15931.05s -> 15939.34s]  I'm down.
[15946.81s -> 15947.45s]  I'm doing it.
[15947.45s -> 15947.93s]  I'm trying.
[15947.93s -> 15948.57s]  It won't do it.
[15948.57s -> 15949.21s]  I'm trying.
[15961.62s -> 15962.18s]  Dick.
[15962.18s -> 15970.42s]  What did I, what the hell did I just do?
[15970.42s -> 15971.22s]  I gotta go down there.
[15971.86s -> 15984.30s]  It's the quickest way to, can I fall over there?
[15984.94s -> 15997.67s]  And then, and then from here I gotta go down.
[15998.47s -> 16000.90s]  Right here, come on.
[16000.90s -> 16008.22s]  And then there's a bonfire down here.
[16009.51s -> 16010.39s]  Somewhere.
[16010.39s -> 16013.61s]  Where the fuck is the bonfire?
[16013.61s -> 16014.41s]  It's like over here.
[16015.29s -> 16016.78s]  Yeah, it's like down here.
[16021.02s -> 16022.30s]  Screw the bonfire.
[16022.30s -> 16023.34s]  I need the bonfire.
[16025.91s -> 16026.39s]  Where is it?
[16057.91s -> 16059.59s]  If you seriously kill me,
[16059.59s -> 16061.91s]  the rats have the shittiest timing too.
[16061.91s -> 16063.59s]  They do like the little bit, bit.
[16064.47s -> 16065.83s]  It's the worst enemy in the game.
[16065.83s -> 16067.19s]  Why did I pick all rats?
[16067.19s -> 16067.99s]  I should have done all,
[16067.99s -> 16070.07s]  like what other joke could I fucking come up with?
[16070.07s -> 16073.35s]  How about all skeletons?
[16073.99s -> 16074.71s]  Funny, right?
[16092.60s -> 16094.12s]  And these idiots poison too.
[16094.68s -> 16100.17s]  I couldn't think of a stupid or fucking thing to try.
[16100.97s -> 16113.43s]  Leave me alone.
[16113.43s -> 16125.11s]  Are these all gonna be rats down here?
[16125.11s -> 16126.87s]  Because they're technically enemies.
[16132.65s -> 16133.69s]  Oh, please.
[16158.89s -> 16159.37s]  Here we go.
[16166.63s -> 16180.87s]  Why is this one on fire?
[16180.87s -> 16181.91s]  Demon pinwheel.
[16197.94s -> 16198.98s]  I thought that hit me in the head.
[16220.02s -> 16221.62s]  No, I'm not going to lose.
[16221.62s -> 16225.38s]  It's just ring the second bell
[16225.38s -> 16227.54s]  and then I have to go through sense fortress
[16227.54s -> 16228.90s]  and then I can get to the end of the game, right?
[16251.64s -> 16252.84s]  Okay, now let me get out.
[16253.74s -> 16256.30s]  Now, it's the four kings.
[16261.26s -> 16264.06s]  Sense fortress is like the end of the prologue chapter.
[16267.96s -> 16269.72s]  I have to do the four pinwheels.
[16269.72s -> 16272.31s]  Okay, give me out.
[16272.31s -> 16272.71s]  I need to.
[16281.86s -> 16283.78s]  I did kill five pinwheels, that's true.
[16284.98s -> 16287.91s]  All right, now where do I go from here?
[16287.91s -> 16288.47s]  We go from...
[16289.91s -> 16291.27s]  I'm back in Blighttown though.
[16298.81s -> 16300.09s]  Do the ceaseless discharge.
[16300.09s -> 16300.73s]  There's no time.
[16321.40s -> 16322.20s]  There's a chest back here.
[16322.20s -> 16323.00s]  Hold on.
[16323.00s -> 16328.46s]  This could be a game changer.
[16329.45s -> 16340.65s]  No, not really.
[16340.65s -> 16342.73s]  Go back and fight.
[16342.73s -> 16346.58s]  I have to go back and fight ceaseless discharge.
[16346.58s -> 16347.54s]  Well, hold on.
[16347.54s -> 16349.30s]  I have to go all the way back here.
[16349.30s -> 16350.34s]  Why did I bone then?
[16350.34s -> 16351.62s]  What was the point of me boning?
[16352.98s -> 16355.22s]  Somebody said bone now and I listened to them.
[16355.86s -> 16379.85s]  Why would you listen to us?
[16379.85s -> 16382.01s]  Because you guys are helpful sometimes.
[16382.01s -> 16383.69s]  You give me correct guidance.
[16397.11s -> 16398.71s]  Waste of like six minutes.
[16399.59s -> 16411.03s]  If we told you to jump off a cliff, would you do it?
[16411.03s -> 16413.05s]  No, because I know that would harm me.
[16416.57s -> 16417.69s]  Ceaseless is optional.
[16420.81s -> 16426.09s]  Yeah, but at some point I have to kill as many pinwheels in another 12 minutes.
[16426.81s -> 16435.29s]  And why do you think ceaseless is really optional?
[16435.29s -> 16455.02s]  This is the clue.
[16455.02s -> 16459.00s]  Hey, well, I might not do it in an hour,
[16459.00s -> 16461.48s]  but I could probably get this done in like another 30-40 minutes.
[16462.12s -> 16465.37s]  All right, let's go.
[16465.93s -> 16466.65s]  I gotta go down.
[16468.10s -> 16469.62s]  And then doesn't there look a lady down here?
[16471.83s -> 16472.33s]  No!
[16499.58s -> 16501.02s]  We had some time for the cutscenes.
[16508.41s -> 16509.61s]  It's not intentional.
[16509.61s -> 16511.13s]  I swear to God.
[16511.13s -> 16512.17s]  I thought I had enough health.
[16512.73s -> 16514.49s]  I didn't realize that because I was poisoned.
[16514.49s -> 16515.85s]  So I was just taking damage.
[16515.85s -> 16517.13s]  I wasn't paying attention to it.
[16519.82s -> 16521.39s]  Oh well.
[16534.60s -> 16536.84s]  No, I'm gonna die again because of this.
[16537.72s -> 16543.48s]  How did you swim through all this?
[16543.96s -> 16555.78s]  I fucking hate the rats.
[16555.78s -> 16556.50s]  I hate the dogs.
[16557.38s -> 16558.82s]  Dogs and rats are two of the worst.
[16561.98s -> 16566.06s]  This time I'm not gonna let my poison tick down
[16566.06s -> 16568.70s]  and not pay attention to it to a point where I die from that fucking drop.
[16569.50s -> 16580.90s]  I mean, there are a lot of mistakes made here.
[16580.90s -> 16584.50s]  One of which is having giant rats and snow rats and any rats.
[16584.50s -> 16585.54s]  I should have had no enemies.
[16600.26s -> 16601.46s]  How did the time go back up?
[16603.56s -> 16604.52s]  I don't know.
[16604.52s -> 16605.16s]  I don't know.
[16605.88s -> 16606.36s]  Did you come?
[16607.24s -> 16608.44s]  Did you go to the bathroom and come back?
[16610.12s -> 16613.94s]  Because maybe you thought you were gone for longer than you were.
[16614.50s -> 16642.87s]  I'm just a bonfire.
[16642.87s -> 16643.59s]  I don't care.
[16648.60s -> 16649.64s]  I know it's the spider lady.
[16649.64s -> 16650.12s]  It doesn't matter.
[16650.68s -> 16660.09s]  Okay, now if I remember it's...
[16660.09s -> 16660.65s]  Wait a minute.
[16661.46s -> 16663.46s]  How is this ceaseless discharge gonna exist?
[16665.45s -> 16666.65s]  It's just pinwheel.
[16666.65s -> 16679.29s]  You see him down there?
[16679.29s -> 16685.19s]  I don't see anything down there.
[16685.19s -> 16686.71s]  Watch him be like 500 feet tall.
[16725.67s -> 16737.00s]  I don't think this is gonna work.
[16737.00s -> 16739.16s]  How do I get him to spawn?
[16739.16s -> 16746.41s]  Didn't even get a chance to spawn.
[16746.41s -> 16747.13s]  He's dead.
[16765.82s -> 16768.15s]  All right, now I need to...
[16769.56s -> 16771.32s]  What's the fastest way to get the hell out of here?
[16771.32s -> 16774.01s]  And the fastest way...
[16774.01s -> 16776.09s]  What's the fastest way to get out of this?
[16776.09s -> 16782.76s]  Go to the altar and get the armor set.
[16782.76s -> 16783.64s]  It's not gonna be an armor set.
[16783.64s -> 16784.52s]  It's gonna be dumb.
[16784.52s -> 16791.96s]  There's nothing here.
[16791.96s -> 16792.36s]  It's gonna be...
[16792.36s -> 16795.02s]  It's random.
[16795.02s -> 16795.82s]  It's a humanity.
[16795.82s -> 16802.95s]  So ceaseless discharge.
[16802.95s -> 16803.27s]  Dead.
[16807.02s -> 16827.75s]  Bone and walk to the elevator and go back up.
[16827.75s -> 16828.95s]  Why did I do that?
[16828.95s -> 16831.27s]  What the fuck did I listen to people for?
[16831.27s -> 16833.29s]  It was right behind me.
[16833.29s -> 16833.85s]  I just had to...
[16834.49s -> 16835.13s]  I thought I...
[16837.93s -> 16839.53s]  I can't believe I did it again.
[16839.53s -> 16841.37s]  I really thought that I was, for some reason,
[16841.37s -> 16842.65s]  didn't rest at that bonfire.
[16842.65s -> 16843.93s]  Let's at least go through here.
[16845.35s -> 16845.99s]  Where's the...
[16845.99s -> 16847.91s]  Where's Quelaag's door?
[16847.91s -> 16849.27s]  It's like a hidden door or something.
[16849.27s -> 16849.83s]  Where is it?
[16881.42s -> 16882.92s]  All right.
[16882.92s -> 16883.56s]  So now...
[16884.12s -> 16884.68s]  Killer.
[16884.68s -> 16885.08s]  Killer.
[16885.08s -> 16885.64s]  You know you're right.
[16885.64s -> 16886.04s]  That's true.
[16895.69s -> 16896.33s]  There's not even...
[16897.05s -> 16899.29s]  There's not even a fucking fire soul here.
[16900.47s -> 16902.07s]  It's a random goddamn item.
[16902.07s -> 16902.57s]  Okay.
[16928.20s -> 16928.70s]  Let's go.
[16929.40s -> 16932.04s]  That doesn't count either because those aren't rats.
[16932.04s -> 16933.16s]  I mean, those aren't pinwheels.
[16941.58s -> 16942.30s]  Sen's fortress.
[16942.30s -> 16942.80s]  Let's go.
[16949.59s -> 16949.91s]  Why...
[16949.91s -> 16951.99s]  Why do I still give a shit about this?
[16951.99s -> 16961.30s]  It's been like an hour and 10 minutes.
[16961.30s -> 16963.58s]  Why do...
[16963.58s -> 16964.14s]  Why am I...
[16964.14s -> 16965.82s]  Why do I care about this so much?
[16965.82s -> 16970.97s]  Ring the bell?
[16970.97s -> 16972.30s]  I did, didn't I?
[16972.30s -> 16974.58s]  I didn't.
[16974.58s -> 16975.06s]  Ring the bell?
[16975.06s -> 16975.70s]  I...
[16975.70s -> 16976.58s]  I rang the bell.
[16976.58s -> 16978.94s]  What do you mean it didn't ring the bell?
[16978.94s -> 16980.14s]  That's the first thing I did when I got up here.
[16992.25s -> 17002.36s]  Let me go back up.
[17002.36s -> 17003.40s]  Do you actually didn't?
[17003.40s -> 17003.90s]  No.
[17004.44s -> 17005.80s]  You're not gonna fool me on this one.
[17005.80s -> 17006.36s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[17007.94s -> 17009.94s]  The first thing I did was pull the lever.
[17010.82s -> 17011.46s]  I remember...
[17011.46s -> 17012.58s]  I have a distinct memory.
[17013.30s -> 17019.91s]  I want that item.
[17020.47s -> 17038.66s]  Swan, let's go.
[17041.64s -> 17043.40s]  I'm gonna turn timer off because I don't even need it.
[17043.40s -> 17043.88s]  What's the point?
[17044.60s -> 17063.42s]  If you turn off the timer, you're admitting defeat.
[17063.98s -> 17073.88s]  And then we go back around.
[17074.60s -> 17078.18s]  What am I looking for here?
[17078.18s -> 17079.06s]  What am I trying to get to?
[17079.70s -> 17087.96s]  If I fell off right there, I would have been...
[17087.96s -> 17089.16s]  It would have probably been the other whole thing.
[17089.16s -> 17089.72s]  I would have turned it off.
[17092.66s -> 17094.98s]  Up all the way and then back to Sen's, right?
[17095.78s -> 17107.59s]  Sen's fortress should be pretty easy,
[17107.59s -> 17109.99s]  considering there's literally nothing besides rats.
[17109.99s -> 17110.63s]  But who knows?
[17110.63s -> 17111.43s]  That might be horrible.
[17112.15s -> 17114.07s]  There's something over there too, but I don't care.
[17115.27s -> 17116.23s]  I'm on a timer over here.
[17118.09s -> 17119.69s]  Yeah, there are traps, but I know where they are.
[17120.49s -> 17137.93s]  Jerma ain't shit.
[17139.37s -> 17143.83s]  Get rid of them.
[17143.83s -> 17144.63s]  Get rid of that person.
[17145.19s -> 17145.75s]  Get rid of them.
[17152.15s -> 17153.35s]  Don't die to poison.
[17154.31s -> 17155.43s]  Poison is your enemy.
[17156.15s -> 17162.76s]  Okay, now I need...
[17162.76s -> 17163.48s]  That's the way out.
[17165.43s -> 17166.07s]  See you later.
[17174.71s -> 17175.91s]  Just a couple of snow rats.
[17176.94s -> 17177.98s]  Don't even pay attention to them.
[17177.98s -> 17178.22s]  Just go.
[17178.86s -> 17181.67s]  I go right into you.
[17191.14s -> 17192.42s]  Bone now.
[17192.42s -> 17195.88s]  Oh, fuck.
[17195.88s -> 17196.52s]  Okay, no, no.
[17196.52s -> 17197.72s]  Seriously, like, I can't fuck this up.
[17213.03s -> 17215.91s]  Dying here would be an actual stream disaster.
[17217.32s -> 17218.12s]  All right.
[17218.12s -> 17218.52s]  Sen's.
[17219.24s -> 17220.12s]  Back through.
[17220.68s -> 17221.56s]  Gotta wrap around.
[17224.33s -> 17225.05s]  I'm gonna go the...
[17225.05s -> 17226.81s]  I'm just gonna go the way that I know how to go.
[17227.45s -> 17242.68s]  Some people are probably saying,
[17243.72s -> 17245.48s]  Dude, dude, boy, you're going the wrong way, man.
[17245.48s -> 17246.12s]  You wrapped...
[17246.12s -> 17246.68s]  No, you went the right way.
[17246.68s -> 17247.48s]  You could have gone the other way.
[17247.48s -> 17248.28s]  You could have gone that way.
[17248.28s -> 17249.16s]  And I'm like, it doesn't matter.
[17249.16s -> 17250.04s]  I'm gonna be fine.
[17250.92s -> 17266.60s]  Should I bone now?
[17267.56s -> 17268.90s]  This is a good time to bone.
[17288.57s -> 17292.57s]  Uh-oh.
[17292.57s -> 17293.37s]  This is bad.
[17294.33s -> 17305.40s]  So I have to go this way.
[17306.04s -> 17311.27s]  Blacksmith and then across to Sen's.
[17311.83s -> 17316.33s]  And to stream.
[17316.33s -> 17318.55s]  No, I'm going to do this.
[17319.11s -> 17324.79s]  I just have to kill Penguin.
[17325.43s -> 17351.50s]  Was there a spell in front of the...
[17351.50s -> 17359.24s]  I really cannot die before getting to the blacksmith.
[17359.24s -> 17361.00s]  You're still following me.
[17361.00s -> 17362.28s]  This is really, really stupid.
[17362.28s -> 17363.08s]  Like, hold on.
[17377.40s -> 17380.04s]  I can't skip Sen's because I can't parry rats.
[17382.76s -> 17383.00s]  Right.
[17383.64s -> 17384.52s]  You're right.
[17384.52s -> 17385.64s]  Yeah, unfortunately.
[17386.28s -> 17387.37s]  It's all right.
[17387.37s -> 17387.69s]  I got this.
[17388.57s -> 17400.81s]  I didn't make him like a Taurus Demon or something, right?
[17401.45s -> 17404.20s]  No, thank God.
[17409.16s -> 17409.88s]  What do I need?
[17409.88s -> 17411.16s]  Demon Titanite?
[17411.16s -> 17412.68s]  Where was the Demon Titanite?
[17412.68s -> 17413.72s]  Didn't the slug have it?
[17414.28s -> 17416.52s]  No, it's because the rats are all...
[17417.72s -> 17419.72s]  I'm not going to get any items to upgrade weapons.
[17419.72s -> 17421.88s]  I'll be seeing you, Speaker.
[17421.88s -> 17422.44s]  That's not good.
[17422.44s -> 17423.32s]  I'm not going to be able to get them.
[17425.59s -> 17426.47s]  It's all rats.
[17426.47s -> 17427.43s]  I'm just going to pick up dung.
[17427.43s -> 17428.47s]  That's the only thing they're going to drop.
[17429.27s -> 17431.50s]  Whatever.
[17431.50s -> 17431.90s]  Let's go.
[17445.45s -> 17447.53s]  You have a Gravelord sword.
[17447.53s -> 17448.65s]  You don't need upgrades.
[17448.65s -> 17449.13s]  Yes, I do.
[17449.93s -> 17451.99s]  You know who you're talking about here?
[17474.17s -> 17498.73s]  It's in the chest.
[17501.78s -> 17502.66s]  A regular mace.
[17502.66s -> 17503.14s]  That's great.
[17512.41s -> 17513.69s]  Did the balls that still drop?
[17515.45s -> 17516.65s]  No, the boulders can't drop
[17516.65s -> 17523.14s]  because there's no giants to drop them.
[17523.14s -> 17523.94s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[17524.50s -> 17538.68s]  This is what you do, right?
[17538.68s -> 17538.92s]  Yeah.
[17553.16s -> 17553.80s]  Oh, fuck.
[17553.80s -> 17555.24s]  I forgot there's some traps.
[17555.24s -> 17566.70s]  And then...
[17566.70s -> 17567.18s]  Wait, hold on.
[17567.18s -> 17568.62s]  I have to wait for this to come down.
[17568.62s -> 17572.73s]  I did know where the traps are.
[17572.73s -> 17580.28s]  I know where they are.
[17587.11s -> 17588.39s]  This is the right thing, right?
[17600.28s -> 17600.60s]  Okay.
[17600.60s -> 17602.28s]  Now, it's...
[17602.28s -> 17603.00s]  I have to move...
[17603.00s -> 17603.72s]  I have to turn this.
[17604.60s -> 17605.48s]  And then we go...
[17606.36s -> 17609.53s]  Where the fuck do we go now?
[17613.22s -> 17614.26s]  Up or around or...
[17615.14s -> 17615.86s]  I don't remember.
[17615.86s -> 17616.26s]  I forget.
[17616.98s -> 17619.48s]  I need to go on top.
[17620.60s -> 17637.10s]  Oh!
[17638.06s -> 17642.84s]  I told you I knew where the traps were.
[17643.48s -> 17664.76s]  All right.
[17664.76s -> 17665.24s]  Then it's up.
[17665.80s -> 17666.84s]  Watch out for the rat.
[17666.84s -> 17667.24s]  There's two.
[17667.96s -> 17668.89s]  I don't know where they are.
[17669.45s -> 17673.26s]  Now we're on...
[17673.26s -> 17674.38s]  This is the iron...
[17674.38s -> 17675.66s]  The iron giant's up here, right?
[17688.52s -> 17689.80s]  I gotta move my body for this.
[17689.80s -> 17690.68s]  I'm going too fast.
[17690.68s -> 17692.76s]  I can stand right there, I think, right?
[17693.56s -> 17694.36s]  Can I stand in the middle?
[17695.08s -> 17700.68s]  All right.
[17700.68s -> 17701.00s]  We're good.
[17705.54s -> 17705.94s]  There it is.
[17720.65s -> 17721.37s]  Now is...
[17721.37s -> 17722.89s]  There's no explosive throws.
[17724.47s -> 17725.35s]  That can't be possible.
[17725.35s -> 17725.59s]  No.
[17725.59s -> 17725.91s]  No way.
[17729.77s -> 17732.33s]  No rat is going to throw an explosive bomb over here.
[17752.50s -> 17754.76s]  Okay.
[17754.76s -> 17755.56s]  Just got to go up.
[17756.28s -> 17767.50s]  I'm almost there.
[17767.50s -> 17768.38s]  And then I can go to Gwyn.
[17769.02s -> 17776.46s]  Wait.
[17776.46s -> 17777.18s]  What about that ring?
[17777.18s -> 17777.66s]  Let me see it.
[17778.30s -> 17781.48s]  Reduces lava damage.
[17786.90s -> 17788.50s]  Crown of the Dark Sun.
[17801.06s -> 17801.38s]  Nice.
[17802.18s -> 17803.78s]  I'm the Angry Mario Sun.
[17803.78s -> 17804.02s]  Cool.
[17805.22s -> 17805.46s]  All right.
[17805.46s -> 17805.78s]  Let's go.
[17821.02s -> 17823.34s]  Now that was an epic gamer reference.
[17823.34s -> 17823.74s]  Thanks.
[17828.57s -> 17829.77s]  You can go up in those, can't you?
[17830.33s -> 17845.10s]  I remember this place was so ridiculous.
[17845.10s -> 17846.86s]  Thank god I can just walk around through it.
[17885.29s -> 17890.10s]  Leggings of Thorns, purging stone.
[17890.10s -> 17891.22s]  Humanity.
[17891.22s -> 17892.02s]  Hooray!
[17892.02s -> 17893.14s]  I did it.
[17893.14s -> 17894.10s]  Give it to me.
[17894.10s -> 17911.64s]  All right.
[17911.64s -> 17912.36s]  And a Londo.
[17914.70s -> 17915.90s]  How much more do I have?
[17915.90s -> 17918.55s]  To actually just jump right down to Gwyn.
[17918.55s -> 17919.93s]  I'm almost there, right?
[17933.86s -> 17936.10s]  Yeah, this is 50% of the way through the game.
[17936.10s -> 17936.98s]  You're right.
[17938.22s -> 17938.78s]  That's true.
[17938.78s -> 17939.58s]  You know, you're right.
[17950.20s -> 17952.84s]  You still are about 30 minutes to an hour to get to Gwyn.
[17967.22s -> 17969.62s]  Hey, well, at least, hey, I beat the good half of the game, right?
[17969.62s -> 17971.30s]  Yeah, that was fun.
[17971.30s -> 17976.63s]  I'm not, no, I'm not.
[17976.63s -> 17994.76s]  That's the only fire keeper I have left.
[17994.76s -> 17995.88s]  Didn't beat Bed of Chaos.
[17995.88s -> 17996.68s]  I know I'm missing stuff.
[17996.68s -> 18002.68s]  I'm just trying to...
[18002.68s -> 18005.00s]  Oh yeah, still have to beat like Ornstein and Smog and...
[18005.56s -> 18014.58s]  Why is there a pinwheel here?
[18014.58s -> 18057.06s]  All right, can I turn it back to like random nonsense again?
[18057.06s -> 18059.38s]  I think this has lost its luster.
[18059.38s -> 18077.05s]  Do a pole?
[18077.05s -> 18077.61s]  Hold on.
[18077.61s -> 18082.17s]  After the next pinwheel, I'll do a pole.
[18082.17s -> 18083.29s]  I'll give it the eight minutes.
[18083.93s -> 18113.05s]  Because I truly failed at that point, right?
[18113.05s -> 18113.77s]  Perfect.
[18113.77s -> 18117.77s]  Why do they always perfectly do this?
[18117.77s -> 18119.13s]  Even a rat will do it.
[18119.13s -> 18122.54s]  So that's surprising to me somehow.
[18122.54s -> 18126.22s]  Watch the Lord Vessel be in the rafter.
[18126.78s -> 18139.32s]  Holy shit, that almost didn't make it.
[18139.32s -> 18156.02s]  Then I got to turn this.
[18159.51s -> 18167.88s]  We spin all the way around, which leads me over here.
[18169.88s -> 18170.92s]  To which is the...
[18170.92s -> 18172.12s]  There's a front door, right?
[18172.12s -> 18172.60s]  Over here.
[18181.56s -> 18185.05s]  This makes 10 pinwheels, doesn't it?
[18185.05s -> 18186.65s]  I think this is 10 pinwheels.
[18195.56s -> 18196.76s]  Almost, that was close.
[18197.24s -> 18198.12s]  You almost had it.
[18198.68s -> 18208.44s]  What'd he drop?
[18209.08s -> 18219.78s]  I don't know.
[18219.78s -> 18223.06s]  Did you set these enemies yourself or did you get fucked by the seed?
[18224.18s -> 18226.74s]  That would be really funny if I didn't set this.
[18226.74s -> 18228.74s]  And it was actually just pinwheels and rats.
[18231.45s -> 18233.13s]  All right, executive decision.
[18233.13s -> 18235.29s]  At six minutes, I'm turning it back on to complete random.
[18235.29s -> 18237.05s]  And I'm going to try to get through at least this part again.
[18240.50s -> 18245.06s]  I mean, there's only so long that you can take an hour and a half of pinwheel and rats.
[18247.78s -> 18249.38s]  You know, there gets to be a point where...
[18250.90s -> 18253.67s]  You see what I'm saying?
[18259.19s -> 18260.39s]  How much more of that can you take?
[18269.69s -> 18270.65s]  Not very much, right?
[18278.94s -> 18280.94s]  This is actually a really hard part of the game.
[18281.58s -> 18287.48s]  It is made completely negligible from rats running off the cliff.
[18287.48s -> 18289.56s]  This is where the big bow and arrow guys are.
[18289.56s -> 18290.68s]  This is awful.
[18290.68s -> 18292.04s]  This spot in particular sucks.
[18303.08s -> 18316.47s]  Where's the bonfire?
[18316.47s -> 18317.27s]  Isn't it in here somewhere?
[18322.06s -> 18324.06s]  I don't even need a bonfire where I'm going.
[18324.78s -> 18327.27s]  Where's Ornstein?
[18327.27s -> 18328.31s]  I'm close to Ornstein.
[18328.87s -> 18333.21s]  I don't need a bonfire where I'm going.
[18333.77s -> 18334.81s]  That's gonna be fine.
[18334.81s -> 18335.53s]  It's just rats.
[18336.17s -> 18341.58s]  I thought that was an enemy and I was like, why is that here?
[18341.58s -> 18341.98s]  Shouldn't be.
[18344.38s -> 18344.94s]  Four minutes.
[18345.50s -> 18359.43s]  This will be the final thing that I do until we do absolute hell mode again
[18359.43s -> 18360.55s]  and I'll try to get through something.
[18361.19s -> 18364.66s]  I have to be pinwheel and pinwheel.
[18365.38s -> 18375.11s]  How do you pronounce Einstein?
[18375.67s -> 18377.13s]  Einstein.
[18377.69s -> 18394.34s]  I don't need bonfires where I'm going.
[18394.34s -> 18394.98s]  Don't worry guys.
[18395.78s -> 18408.17s]  Oh yeah, I can jump off this.
[18408.17s -> 18410.17s]  Here we go.
[18410.17s -> 18415.94s]  Here we go.
[18416.58s -> 18434.71s]  This doesn't do anything, right?
[18436.06s -> 18443.91s]  Wait, will it be...
[18443.91s -> 18445.83s]  Is it gonna be NPCs?
[18446.63s -> 18453.80s]  I don't got time for this shit.
[18453.80s -> 18454.68s]  It's just gonna be normal.
[18454.68s -> 18456.04s]  No, you've already seen that before.
[18456.04s -> 18458.55s]  Who cares?
[18458.55s -> 18468.15s]  You want me to use the orb or do you want to see two pinwheels?
[18468.15s -> 18468.79s]  Both.
[18468.79s -> 18476.20s]  I'm gonna die to this person.
[18476.20s -> 18477.32s]  I can't even use this.
[18477.32s -> 18494.94s]  It's gonna be three pinwheels.
[18495.50s -> 18496.22s]  Oh no, it's not.
[18537.00s -> 18546.30s]  I got no stamina for this shit.
[18547.02s -> 18557.34s]  Bastard.
[18568.34s -> 18574.23s]  No!
[18574.23s -> 18575.67s]  That does so much fucking damage.
[18598.36s -> 18598.68s]  Whoa!
[18600.20s -> 18600.52s]  Hey!
[18601.24s -> 18601.96s]  What's going on?
[18602.84s -> 18604.04s]  What happened?
[18604.04s -> 18604.28s]  Hey!
[18608.87s -> 18609.67s]  What's happening?
[18610.63s -> 18611.67s]  It's so loud.
[18612.39s -> 18614.07s]  It's fucking up my concentration.
[18616.71s -> 18617.99s]  It's burning into my brain.
[18618.55s -> 18619.11s]  It hurts.
[18622.20s -> 18624.28s]  Take the popcorn out of the microwave.
[18628.22s -> 18629.26s]  Oh, it's the timer.
[18629.26s -> 18629.98s]  It's the timer.
[18631.10s -> 18637.62s]  The hard part's over.
[18637.62s -> 18638.26s]  Just get it done.
[18647.96s -> 18649.00s]  It's getting louder.
[18649.56s -> 18654.55s]  I think it's actually getting louder.
[18659.19s -> 18659.83s]  I miss it.
[18659.83s -> 18660.55s]  I like Monopack.
[18661.43s -> 18662.63s]  I kind of like want it back.
[18662.63s -> 18663.11s]  Where is it?
[18663.67s -> 18664.94s]  Oh, it's freaking me.
[18664.94s -> 18666.86s]  It's fucking messing with me even more.
[18666.86s -> 18676.52s]  Did I win?
[18676.52s -> 18689.75s]  I didn't even get his item.
[18689.75s -> 18691.27s]  That, I swear to God.
[18691.27s -> 18692.47s]  I thought, I, you know what?
[18692.47s -> 18693.91s]  Here's what I thought actually happened.
[18695.08s -> 18697.56s]  I thought there was an emergency on the computer.
[18699.53s -> 18703.13s]  Like somehow in Windows 10, there's an emergency signal
[18703.13s -> 18704.25s]  with something really bad.
[18704.25s -> 18707.45s]  Like you got a virus or your memory is bad
[18707.45s -> 18709.21s]  or your computer's gonna start to burn or something.
[18709.21s -> 18710.09s]  Like Intel has a thing.
[18710.09s -> 18712.25s]  Like your computer's burning.
[18712.25s -> 18713.53s]  I had no idea what that was.
[18714.17s -> 18725.58s]  Here they go.
[18733.58s -> 18738.25s]  I love the little teeth intestines thing.
[18743.93s -> 18745.29s]  Pinwheel and pinstein.
[18746.09s -> 18769.05s]  Wait, what happens when you kill one of them?
[18769.05s -> 18770.81s]  Do they turn into a super pinwheel?
[18793.29s -> 18796.01s]  Oh, look at this.
[18796.01s -> 18809.99s]  I think he just got bigger.
[18831.93s -> 18833.64s]  That was a lot easier.
[18834.84s -> 18835.80s]  Which way did he go?
[18838.46s -> 18840.86s]  I swear he was just standing right in front of me.
[18842.01s -> 18842.41s]  Weird.
[18843.05s -> 18864.78s]  Here comes the Lord Vessel.
[18864.86s -> 18867.34s]  Now I go talk to the weird snake thing in the ground
[18867.34s -> 18868.46s]  and I say yes.
[18868.46s -> 18877.90s]  And we're going back to fully random.
[18877.90s -> 18879.02s]  I did my pinwheel.
[18880.26s -> 18881.38s]  I did my pinwheel.
[18881.38s -> 18922.15s]  Penance, give me the Lord Vessel.
[18922.15s -> 18925.62s]  Thank you.
[18925.62s -> 18929.22s]  Go get the Lord Vessel and then come back to see me.
[18929.86s -> 18934.50s]  Bring the Lord Vessel back and claim Gwyn as the rightful.
[18935.22s -> 18939.11s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[18939.11s -> 18943.62s]  Oh, by the way, eat shit.
[18965.69s -> 18967.93s]  I will transform into pinwheel.
[18979.50s -> 18980.22s]  Whatever.
[18980.22s -> 18989.69s]  Let's go to...
[18989.69s -> 18990.73s]  Where do I want to go now?
[18990.73s -> 18991.61s]  Quickly, quickly, tell me.
[18991.61s -> 18992.09s]  Where do I go?
[18992.09s -> 18997.61s]  I go to Firelink, talk to the snake.
[18997.61s -> 18999.21s]  And then we're going to do all random.
[19004.06s -> 19006.06s]  Oh, yes, you found the Lord Vessel.
[19006.94s -> 19009.74s]  Give it here, you fucking wanker.
[19010.30s -> 19027.13s]  All right, fastest way for me to do this.
[19028.22s -> 19030.22s]  What's the fastest way to get to Gwyn?
[19039.50s -> 19040.46s]  Say yes or say no.
[19053.69s -> 19055.37s]  Did you kill a bunch of people going down here?
[19057.93s -> 19058.81s]  Who are you killing?
[19058.81s -> 19059.69s]  People are just dying.
[19066.60s -> 19068.76s]  Sif, Four Kings, Pinwheel, Nito, Gwyn.
[19068.76s -> 19069.40s]  That's too long.
[19070.52s -> 19086.07s]  Killing the actual pinwheel is your real final fight.
[19086.07s -> 19088.47s]  But the thing is, pinwheel is not going to be pinwheel.
[19089.19s -> 19091.35s]  Pinwheel is going to get replaced by a different boss.
[19092.39s -> 19096.39s]  See, that's the big kicker here.
[19113.06s -> 19113.94s]  All right, here we go.
[19114.98s -> 19116.02s]  The timer's still on the screen?
[19116.02s -> 19116.98s]  Yeah, I'll do it.
[19118.50s -> 19120.78s]  Let's warp to...
[19122.54s -> 19123.50s]  Where the hell do I need to go?
[19123.50s -> 19124.54s]  First of all, let me do random.
[19125.50s -> 19127.70s]  This is all saved, we're good.
[19131.46s -> 19133.06s]  All right, here comes the shit show.
[19133.86s -> 19135.70s]  And we're probably going to end on this note here.
[19136.58s -> 19139.45s]  I'm actually surprised we've been doing this for five and a half hours almost.
[19139.45s -> 19146.52s]  So let's do one more rowdy randomize.
[19147.16s -> 19152.76s]  Replace bosses with bosses.
[19153.40s -> 19158.22s]  Replace normal enemies with bosses or normal enemies.
[19161.08s -> 19162.68s]  Replace NPCs.
[19162.68s -> 19168.22s]  Replacement chance for a boss to be a random enemy will be 20%.
[19170.38s -> 19171.26s]  All bosses.
[19171.74s -> 19180.65s]  So replace bosses with bosses and replace normal enemies with bosses.
[19181.37s -> 19183.75s]  Am I doing...
[19188.15s -> 19189.91s]  We already did that and it was too much.
[19190.47s -> 19194.86s]  No, replace bosses with bosses.
[19194.86s -> 19197.90s]  Replace normal enemies with normal enemies or bosses.
[19199.24s -> 19203.72s]  And there is a 10% chance that a normal enemy will be a boss.
[19204.28s -> 19207.40s]  Don't replace NPCs.
[19207.40s -> 19209.80s]  It's fully random, you can put them anywhere, 10%.
[19210.68s -> 19219.75s]  Let's open up the config and enable everybody.
[19219.75s -> 19221.93s]  Okay, that sounds good to me.
[19222.57s -> 19224.47s]  Am I feeling lucky?
[19224.47s -> 19225.11s]  We'll find out.
[19231.43s -> 19233.27s]  This is the best night to be high.
[19237.46s -> 19240.42s]  Oh, by the way, I'm not going to be live tomorrow because of 4th of July.
[19241.14s -> 19244.23s]  Kim and I are going to go see some fireworks.
[19244.87s -> 19248.89s]  So you'll probably see me again on either Friday or Saturday.
[19250.01s -> 19251.93s]  I might have some stuff that I want to do for the carnival.
[19252.73s -> 19253.93s]  So depending on...
[19253.93s -> 19255.29s]  Just keep an eye on the sus.
[19255.29s -> 19256.57s]  Friday or Saturday you'll see me again.
[19257.21s -> 19262.76s]  Should be fun.
[19264.79s -> 19265.67s]  And I'm ready to start.
[19265.67s -> 19265.99s]  Let's go.
[19269.45s -> 19281.59s]  Speaking of getting high, I won't be broadcasting tomorrow.
[19281.59s -> 19282.95s]  Oh, really makes you think.
[19282.95s -> 19283.19s]  No.
[19284.90s -> 19285.14s]  No.
[19290.97s -> 19291.77s]  All right, let's go.
[19292.79s -> 19293.67s]  I need to go to...
[19296.44s -> 19297.64s]  Uh, what?
[19297.64s -> 19298.52s]  Firelink?
[19298.52s -> 19300.04s]  Or what's closest to...
[19301.16s -> 19302.84s]  I have to go down in like the depths or something.
[19302.84s -> 19304.28s]  Catacombs or something, right?
[19304.28s -> 19312.66s]  If I remember correctly, I just have to walk down from Firelink.
[19313.46s -> 19318.81s]  Go revive the Firekeeper.
[19322.18s -> 19322.98s]  What's dying?
[19322.98s -> 19323.62s]  I don't know.
[19323.62s -> 19324.50s]  Something above us?
[19325.30s -> 19327.93s]  Oh, the timer overlay, right.
[19338.07s -> 19338.71s]  10%?
[19340.41s -> 19341.45s]  10% chance.
[19342.01s -> 19344.39s]  Oh, are you sure it's on 10%?
[19345.03s -> 19351.45s]  Because I swear it is.
[19352.09s -> 19361.13s]  It's not on 100.
[19361.13s -> 19361.85s]  I saved it.
[19361.85s -> 19362.81s]  I made sure it wasn't.
[19372.82s -> 19373.30s]  You're back.
[19373.30s -> 19373.86s]  Everything's fine.
[19373.86s -> 19374.34s]  You're alive.
[19375.06s -> 19385.96s]  Is it still not lit?
[19392.90s -> 19394.18s]  I have to light this thing.
[19394.90s -> 19397.14s]  I'm not going to go like this.
[19397.14s -> 19398.10s]  But now you stand up.
[19401.66s -> 19402.86s]  Well, maybe I...
[19410.01s -> 19410.97s]  You ran out of time.
[19410.97s -> 19411.45s]  You lose.
[19411.45s -> 19413.37s]  All right, let me get this off the screen.
[19413.37s -> 19414.09s]  That would be nice.
[19415.21s -> 19424.76s]  Let's go to Firelink.
[19433.42s -> 19435.26s]  Now I need to go from Firelink.
[19435.82s -> 19436.38s]  No, don't...
[19436.38s -> 19436.78s]  I don't...
[19436.78s -> 19437.58s]  Everything's already lit.
[19437.58s -> 19438.06s]  It's fine.
[19438.06s -> 19438.62s]  Okay, we're good.
[19439.50s -> 19440.94s]  So now I need to level up.
[19441.74s -> 19442.46s]  I don't have enough.
[19443.42s -> 19449.05s]  Here come all the enemies up there.
[19453.70s -> 19455.38s]  So you're just hanging out here sleeping.
[19459.00s -> 19463.56s]  Now I need to go down from here to the graveyard, right?
[19464.28s -> 19469.21s]  This is the fastest way to the graveyard.
[19470.57s -> 19476.15s]  I always have trouble getting to the graveyard
[19476.15s -> 19477.27s]  by simply walking to it.
[19477.83s -> 19481.37s]  It's like down that way, right?
[19487.00s -> 19496.09s]  Isn't it like down here?
[19497.91s -> 19500.15s]  Where is that dumb walkway to the graveyard?
[19501.51s -> 19502.47s]  It's not this way.
[19503.03s -> 19504.54s]  Help me, help me, help me, help me.
[19504.54s -> 19505.10s]  Somebody help me.
[19505.10s -> 19505.74s]  Help me.
[19505.74s -> 19506.54s]  Help me.
[19506.54s -> 19507.10s]  I need help.
[19507.82s -> 19519.08s]  Wait, it's an emote-only mode.
[19519.08s -> 19519.58s]  Fuck.
[19520.28s -> 19523.19s]  What are you guys doing?
[19525.18s -> 19526.46s]  Why is it an emote-only mode?
[19526.46s -> 19545.19s]  What's going on over here?
[19545.19s -> 19546.47s]  Left of the snake man.
[19546.47s -> 19547.99s]  All right, I'm going to go left of the snake man.
[19565.08s -> 19565.48s]  Thank you.
[19573.70s -> 19577.29s]  10 percent.
[19577.29s -> 19578.65s]  How is this 10 percent?
[19578.65s -> 19579.77s]  It's like 60.
[19583.75s -> 19585.03s]  I don't- I've never-
[19585.03s -> 19586.31s]  I don't think I've seen-
[19586.31s -> 19587.51s]  Did I actually get cursed?
[19587.51s -> 19591.19s]  Oh yeah, because these stupid things curse you.
[19591.19s -> 19593.75s]  I've never even seen that boss before.
[19598.42s -> 19599.14s]  Oh, and I'm-
[19599.14s -> 19600.74s]  My HP is cut in half.
[19602.01s -> 19602.65s]  Great.
[19602.65s -> 19605.27s]  Good thing I have that-
[19607.35s -> 19608.71s]  Good thing I have the purging stone.
[19609.27s -> 19610.87s]  I'm not using it yet till I get through this.
[19611.51s -> 19620.82s]  I wanted the item.
[19633.06s -> 19633.56s]  Shit.
[19636.22s -> 19637.02s]  I gotta just run.
[19637.98s -> 19640.20s]  That wake up was-
[19641.40s -> 19643.24s]  May as well have been street fighter.
[19643.80s -> 19644.30s]  What?
[19645.00s -> 19651.61s]  Why does he have a big purple rock?
[19654.82s -> 19656.42s]  He has a crunch berry.
[19666.02s -> 19667.30s]  That was boo berry.
[19667.30s -> 19668.50s]  That wasn't even an enemy.
[19669.22s -> 19678.30s]  What a shithole.
[19678.86s -> 19679.66s]  Oh my god.
[19680.30s -> 19684.41s]  This is just a shit show.
[19685.29s -> 19687.66s]  Thankfully Sip is not running over here too.
[19695.11s -> 19697.19s]  Is it 10 percent for normal enemies?
[19697.19s -> 19699.11s]  I really would not be surprised
[19699.11s -> 19699.91s]  if that were the case.
[19708.49s -> 19709.69s]  I deserve to die for that one.
[19710.25s -> 19716.15s]  Dude, it really might be 10 percent for normal-
[19716.15s -> 19717.91s]  There's another big fucking enemy over here.
[19721.70s -> 19724.42s]  There's another centipede down here.
[19732.38s -> 19732.94s]  Let me look at it.
[19732.94s -> 19733.50s]  What does it say?
[19734.22s -> 19738.92s]  Percent boss chance.
[19738.92s -> 19740.76s]  Chance that a normal enemy or NPC
[19740.76s -> 19742.20s]  will be replaced with a boss
[19742.20s -> 19743.64s]  instead of a normal enemy.
[19743.64s -> 19745.32s]  10 percent.
[19745.96s -> 19751.43s]  It's 10-
[19751.43s -> 19752.71s]  It's on 10 percent.
[19752.71s -> 19772.92s]  Percentages don't work like a one in 10.
[19775.24s -> 19776.28s]  That's 10 percent.
[19777.08s -> 19779.08s]  That means 10 percent per enemy.
[19779.08s -> 19781.56s]  So one in 10 chance for every enemy to be a boss.
[19783.70s -> 19786.02s]  Yeah, but that's still a nine out of 10 chance.
[19786.02s -> 19786.90s]  It has to roll that.
[19786.90s -> 19788.02s]  You still have to roll a one.
[19794.20s -> 19795.08s]  You know, in that scenario
[19795.08s -> 19796.52s]  you still got to roll a one.
[19796.52s -> 19798.04s]  I don't know why I keep going down
[19798.76s -> 19799.56s]  the stairs over there.
[19803.86s -> 19805.54s]  If you open random number generator right now
[19805.54s -> 19808.74s]  you probably get six, two, two, eight, nine,
[19808.74s -> 19812.74s]  two, six, six, six, four, three, three, three, six, eight, two, two, one.
[19813.62s -> 19831.40s]  I don't think I'm even gonna be able to walk through this door.
[19835.67s -> 19836.89s]  What an ass.
[19846.12s -> 19847.16s]  Oh no, an ass?
[19854.30s -> 19854.94s]  All right.
[19854.94s -> 19855.90s]  Perching stone time.
[19858.58s -> 19871.56s]  Do you see anything down there?
[19873.26s -> 19874.22s]  I do not see a boss.
[19882.74s -> 19888.04s]  I love how the dog T-pose is just a fancy weird rug.
[19888.60s -> 19895.61s]  It's one of those like stupid like rugs on the ground.
[19895.61s -> 19906.25s]  Just rolled into that.
[19906.81s -> 19910.79s]  Okay, is it bonfire?
[19910.79s -> 19919.62s]  I'm rolling it again.
[19919.62s -> 19924.55s]  I'm putting it down to five percent.
[19925.11s -> 19933.85s]  I just rolled it.
[19933.85s -> 19935.53s]  I ain't having the centipede down there.
[19948.70s -> 19949.42s]  OBS crash?
[19949.42s -> 19950.38s]  No, OBS is fine.
[19950.38s -> 19952.14s]  Reach it up.
[19952.14s -> 19953.42s]  Well, you want to reroll the items too.
[19953.42s -> 19954.54s]  I mean, we're at the end.
[19954.54s -> 19959.58s]  Why don't we just reroll items?
[19959.58s -> 19966.70s]  Just who cares?
[19966.70s -> 19967.26s]  Yeah, fuck it.
[19967.26s -> 19967.74s]  Let's do it.
[19969.19s -> 19979.90s]  All right, here it comes.
[19979.90s -> 19983.67s]  Let's reroll the items again.
[19983.67s -> 19991.94s]  So let's do just scrambled.
[19991.94s -> 19992.90s]  Scrambling the items.
[19997.42s -> 19999.58s]  Success.
[19999.58s -> 20001.86s]  Items have been scrambled.
[20001.86s -> 20003.14s]  So have the enemies.
[20003.14s -> 20007.90s]  Do I like my eggs scrambled?
[20007.90s -> 20008.78s]  Yes, I do.
[20008.78s -> 20013.00s]  I like them over easy, over medium.
[20013.56s -> 20017.77s]  Semi-side up to me is disgusting.
[20020.94s -> 20022.94s]  No, would not like to eat that.
[20029.99s -> 20032.52s]  Is there a bear in here?
[20032.52s -> 20033.69s]  Oh, it's a cat.
[20035.50s -> 20036.46s]  Did my items?
[20036.46s -> 20038.78s]  The items on me didn't scramble.
[20038.78s -> 20051.32s]  Where the hell does it think I am?
[20054.34s -> 20054.90s]  Oh, okay.
[20054.90s -> 20056.02s]  No, this is where I was.
[20063.00s -> 20083.88s]  What's the tree?
[20084.44s -> 20091.86s]  Is that a piece of broccoli?
[20093.51s -> 20095.03s]  Wait.
[20095.03s -> 20098.07s]  Oh, all the items have been respawned and replaced.
[20104.55s -> 20105.03s]  Interesting.
[20105.59s -> 20113.96s]  Okay.
[20113.96s -> 20114.76s]  I want to see what it is.
[20115.74s -> 20120.52s]  I just want to see what the tree is, man.
[20121.40s -> 20124.60s]  I just want to see what the broccoli thing is.
[20126.04s -> 20129.18s]  Okay, somebody explain this to me.
[20129.82s -> 20137.70s]  Do you know that inside of a clamshell package,
[20137.70s -> 20141.46s]  a plastic packaging smell, like brand new plastic packaging.
[20142.26s -> 20145.16s]  Why am I smelling that right now?
[20145.72s -> 20146.36s]  What does that mean?
[20147.56s -> 20168.04s]  My room right now smells like synthetic plastic.
[20168.04s -> 20172.10s]  Synthetic plastic for no reason.
[20182.34s -> 20182.90s]  As opposed to...
[20182.90s -> 20183.22s]  No, no, no.
[20183.22s -> 20186.02s]  It's a very distinct plastic smell.
[20186.58s -> 20187.86s]  Just give it to the broccoli, please.
[20191.67s -> 20193.03s]  No, not like plastic burning.
[20193.03s -> 20195.19s]  Just plastic like inside of a plastic bag.
[20196.07s -> 20199.27s]  I need to kill the broccoli before I die.
[20199.27s -> 20199.99s]  Thank God.
[20211.42s -> 20212.46s]  Bag on head.
[20213.10s -> 20213.74s]  What's happening?
[20213.74s -> 20214.62s]  There's a bag on me.
[20215.66s -> 20221.13s]  What the fuck is that smell?
[20221.13s -> 20222.57s]  It's freaking me out.
[20222.57s -> 20223.21s]  All right, hold on.
[20223.21s -> 20227.34s]  I'm gonna need to go see why the house smells like
[20227.98s -> 20231.02s]  the inside of a clamshell synthetic packaging.
[20231.82s -> 20233.77s]  All right, hold on.
[20233.77s -> 20234.33s]  Give me a second.
[20234.33s -> 20235.77s]  What the fuck is going on?
[20236.41s -> 20338.50s]  I'm not crazy.
[20338.50s -> 20344.55s]  So Kim is cleaning the oven all the way up here.
[20344.55s -> 20345.27s]  I knew it was happening.
[20346.07s -> 20351.45s]  Yeah, I'm telling you.
[20352.33s -> 20354.82s]  Am I putting you guys to sleep?
[20356.66s -> 20357.38s]  Sorry about that.
[20357.38s -> 20359.54s]  All right, let's wrap this up.
[20359.54s -> 20360.90s]  I need to kill the real pinwheel
[20362.15s -> 20363.99s]  and then stream some propaganda.
[20376.33s -> 20379.85s]  I'm determined to go get whatever is in pinwheel's place.
[20380.49s -> 20381.88s]  It has to die.
[20385.22s -> 20386.50s]  Not terrible spawn here.
[20387.22s -> 20391.62s]  Remember, all the items have been replaced again.
[20391.62s -> 20392.50s]  They've all been rolled again.
[20394.92s -> 20395.80s]  Not worth it.
[20395.80s -> 20402.66s]  You don't want to eat something coming up.
[20402.66s -> 20404.34s]  No, so what happens is when you clean an oven,
[20404.34s -> 20405.70s]  you have to make it really, really hot.
[20406.66s -> 20411.91s]  And from there, it's just kind of hot.
[20411.91s -> 20412.55s]  What is that?
[20424.30s -> 20425.66s]  Use the parry dagger.
[20425.66s -> 20431.61s]  No, it's a DLC boss.
[20432.49s -> 20434.65s]  I did all the Dark Souls DLC, didn't I?
[20434.65s -> 20435.85s]  I don't remember seeing that.
[20436.41s -> 20437.82s]  I didn't skip anything.
[20445.53s -> 20448.41s]  I know, I remember the Kameera thing.
[20449.21s -> 20451.29s]  I never remember it looking like that.
[20451.29s -> 20454.97s]  I thought it was orange and like tan, not white.
[20455.93s -> 20464.47s]  No, that's just him.
[20465.03s -> 20466.15s]  Remember I did both of them?
[20467.19s -> 20469.42s]  I did, yeah.
[20470.22s -> 20471.58s]  Remember I did the thing where you don't have to do it
[20471.58s -> 20472.30s]  and I killed them both?
[20476.47s -> 20478.79s]  Hey, you know I did the thing where I started talking
[20478.79s -> 20479.67s]  and walking in a circle?
[20480.55s -> 20482.07s]  You know how I do that, right?
[20482.07s -> 20482.47s]  LOL.
[20483.43s -> 20518.60s]  Yeah, when I get to this, this has got to end.
[20520.63s -> 20526.98s]  This is like, I think this is what it feels like
[20526.98s -> 20528.34s]  when somebody screams in your face
[20528.34s -> 20530.34s]  for more than like five to 10 straight minutes.
[20531.06s -> 20532.89s]  This is definitely what it feels like.
[20533.61s -> 20551.80s]  You'd feel all fucked up,
[20551.80s -> 20554.14s]  but it would be things would seem off.
[20555.02s -> 20556.70s]  Your room would start to smell like plastic.
[20557.34s -> 20575.90s]  Okay, I'm so close.
[20576.92s -> 20579.64s]  This time, just fall and run.
[20580.60s -> 20590.54s]  No, you're too big.
[20590.54s -> 20591.42s]  He's too big.
[20592.22s -> 20598.92s]  And then there's the little dinosaur things down here.
[20598.92s -> 20600.20s]  There's a guy down here.
[20603.37s -> 20604.97s]  What did I get caught on?
[20605.77s -> 20615.16s]  I have to kill this fucking thing, don't I?
[20615.80s -> 20633.90s]  You can do the same fucking move like five times.
[20635.72s -> 20636.60s]  I hate this game.
[20646.17s -> 20647.93s]  He's not even supposed to be down here.
[20647.93s -> 20648.89s]  I have to kill this.
[20657.27s -> 20661.58s]  Let me fight a blue dragon in as much room
[20661.58s -> 20664.46s]  as it takes to fit a blue dragon.
[20664.46s -> 20665.98s]  It's fucking great.
[20698.44s -> 20700.12s]  There's all kinds of zany characters here.
[20700.12s -> 20701.40s]  Everything is so zany.
[20702.60s -> 20711.00s]  Is he still trying to beat the game?
[20711.00s -> 20714.82s]  No, I'm just trying to get to Pinwheel
[20714.82s -> 20716.34s]  who is not even real Pinwheel.
[20717.56s -> 20719.32s]  But there's a different problem here.
[20719.32s -> 20724.68s]  There is a blue dragon who is now blocking my path.
[20724.68s -> 20726.04s]  I'm probably gonna have to aggro up here.
[20727.00s -> 20738.15s]  I didn't even know you could do that.
[20746.28s -> 20747.32s]  Actually, stay there
[20747.32s -> 20748.76s]  because you'll block anything that comes in.
[20768.70s -> 20770.22s]  He can't fit through there now either.
[20771.61s -> 20772.49s]  Oh my God.
[20784.18s -> 20784.98s]  Don't block me.
[20786.65s -> 20787.37s]  Come on.
[20793.75s -> 20796.47s]  I have to bait the electricity and then...
[20797.35s -> 20798.55s]  What just came down here?
[20800.02s -> 20801.46s]  What just sprinted down here?
[20802.02s -> 20802.82s]  The cat.
[20808.20s -> 20809.08s]  I'm gonna reroll it.
[20809.64s -> 20813.30s]  You can't fight that thing down there.
[20813.30s -> 20814.82s]  You can't fight that fucking thing in that room.
[20816.65s -> 20817.61s]  I gotta reroll that thing.
[20828.68s -> 20829.32s]  Pull the switch.
[20831.30s -> 20833.30s]  I want the bonfire so I don't have to keep...
[20833.30s -> 20835.14s]  But even if I get the bonfire,
[20835.78s -> 20838.26s]  I'm going to be at that bonfire
[20838.26s -> 20840.50s]  and a blue dragon will be behind me every single time.
[20857.93s -> 20858.81s]  I'm just rushing.
[20859.53s -> 20861.34s]  Fucking randomizing, man.
[20862.14s -> 20866.58s]  We're getting close to throwing up.
[20881.45s -> 20883.13s]  I would just walk straight, but watch.
[20883.77s -> 20889.05s]  I have to deal with all this bullshit.
[20897.88s -> 20899.24s]  It's safer to almost die.
[20900.36s -> 20901.64s]  All right, I'm gonna go pull the switch
[20902.20s -> 20904.09s]  and I'm gonna run the hell out of there.
[20904.09s -> 20918.58s]  This double blue dragon shit is like seriously...
[20919.38s -> 20920.66s]  How many enemies are in this game?
[20920.66s -> 20921.70s]  Like 600.
[20922.66s -> 20924.42s]  And I get just blue dragons.
[20925.22s -> 20937.11s]  I'm going for the pole and then I'm out.
[20937.91s -> 20941.34s]  Okay, give me stamina.
[20941.34s -> 20941.74s]  Here we go.
[20942.46s -> 20959.32s]  Please move.
[20959.32s -> 20978.31s]  There's another blue dragon, I swear.
[20979.03s -> 20985.27s]  All right, what do we got?
[20985.27s -> 20986.79s]  What do we got, what do we got, what do we got?
[20986.79s -> 20989.26s]  We have nothing that...
[20989.26s -> 20990.38s]  Is this thing gonna activate?
[20991.10s -> 20992.22s]  Is it gonna activate, isn't it?
[20993.80s -> 20994.68s]  It's not gonna activate, right?
[20995.24s -> 21005.96s]  Can I just...
[21005.96s -> 21006.92s]  No, it's a...
[21006.92s -> 21012.06s]  Shit.
[21012.06s -> 21019.58s]  Where are you shooting me from?
[21019.58s -> 21021.42s]  What's this line of sight you got here?
[21022.30s -> 21035.96s]  Oh, God.
[21046.52s -> 21048.04s]  Just go, just run around them.
[21050.38s -> 21051.02s]  Don't activate.
[21053.94s -> 21056.10s]  As long as these pigs don't activate, I'll be fine.
[21056.66s -> 21069.88s]  Why am I not hurting this?
[21090.44s -> 21091.72s]  Fully armored pig.
[21091.72s -> 21094.66s]  All right, so far so good.
[21110.25s -> 21111.13s]  Oh, God.
[21111.13s -> 21111.61s]  Come on.
[21124.92s -> 21125.64s]  Basement key.
[21125.64s -> 21126.60s]  That's not gonna do shit.
[21127.16s -> 21140.25s]  I don't want to get punched in the back of the head.
[21140.97s -> 21150.49s]  What the hell?
[21150.49s -> 21156.28s]  Is this a trap or is this a...
[21157.24s -> 21158.12s]  Why is this over here?
[21171.66s -> 21173.02s]  You can't be serious.
[21173.82s -> 21176.46s]  Did I just actually get hit right in the fucking head?
[21177.34s -> 21180.14s]  But a toxic...
[21187.75s -> 21188.95s]  Oh, my God.
[21188.95s -> 21190.23s]  Why do you have to be here?
[21193.80s -> 21194.84s]  I don't have any clumps, I don't think.
[21195.40s -> 21206.46s]  No, why would I have any clumps?
[21208.92s -> 21209.96s]  All right, I need...
[21209.96s -> 21210.76s]  What do I need to do?
[21210.76s -> 21211.96s]  I need to deactivate.
[21211.96s -> 21212.52s]  What do I need to do?
[21213.16s -> 21214.87s]  I need to...
[21214.87s -> 21215.35s]  I'm dead.
[21215.91s -> 21217.69s]  I don't even have the fucking bonfire either.
[21218.41s -> 21228.71s]  I don't even...
[21228.71s -> 21230.47s]  I don't remember this area at all either.
[21231.59s -> 21235.80s]  Of course you have to place those toxic enemies everywhere.
[21236.52s -> 21237.90s]  Like, why wouldn't you?
[21238.54s -> 21239.02s]  Just put...
[21239.74s -> 21241.82s]  Put blue dragons and toxic fucking...
[21242.70s -> 21243.58s]  Blow dart people.
[21260.30s -> 21262.86s]  I ain't ever gonna get that bonfire as long as he's in there.
[21263.66s -> 21264.62s]  No, I'm dead.
[21264.62s -> 21268.97s]  There's nothing I can do.
[21268.97s -> 21269.37s]  Just die.
[21271.82s -> 21272.22s]  Mushroom?
[21272.22s -> 21272.70s]  Use a...
[21272.70s -> 21273.26s]  What mushroom?
[21273.82s -> 21275.50s]  Removes plastic from the body.
[21291.70s -> 21293.54s]  This fucking thing has to die.
[21294.42s -> 21299.22s]  Where is it even aiming?
[21299.22s -> 21314.33s]  What's with the stamina?
[21315.05s -> 21319.29s]  I just cheesed this asshole.
[21319.29s -> 21319.61s]  All right.
[21320.25s -> 21320.57s]  I got...
[21320.57s -> 21334.42s]  I'm good.
[21334.42s -> 21335.70s]  Ay, yi, yi.
[21335.70s -> 21338.81s]  Not everything's respawned, though.
[21339.77s -> 21341.96s]  Not like it matters.
[21350.66s -> 21354.02s]  If Pinwheel is not Pinwheel and he's somebody...
[21354.02s -> 21356.10s]  I hope he's somebody really, really easy.
[21356.98s -> 21359.58s]  Please, Pinwheel.
[21360.66s -> 21361.54s]  Do not be...
[21361.54s -> 21363.54s]  Can't I just jump over this or something?
[21363.54s -> 21364.74s]  There's a way to do this, isn't there?
[21365.46s -> 21368.52s]  I can just launch over here and grab or something, right?
[21369.08s -> 21374.84s]  It's like right there, isn't it?
[21375.40s -> 21381.62s]  It's like right there, isn't it?
[21381.62s -> 21382.10s]  Am I...
[21382.10s -> 21383.22s]  I'm correct, aren't I?
[21383.94s -> 21389.48s]  No.
[21390.76s -> 21391.32s]  Is it up higher?
[21392.44s -> 21396.12s]  Over there?
[21396.12s -> 21398.92s]  I've never tried...
[21398.92s -> 21399.96s]  I've never done it before.
[21399.96s -> 21400.36s]  Right there?
[21401.24s -> 21411.78s]  On the other side of the bridge?
[21418.68s -> 21419.48s]  I've never tried it before.
[21419.48s -> 21420.44s]  I don't know.
[21420.44s -> 21422.04s]  I'm just trying to get to Pinwheel.
[21424.34s -> 21425.94s]  Right off the front of the bridge, okay?
[21426.66s -> 21433.16s]  This guy wasn't here before.
[21433.80s -> 21436.62s]  Is there a reason why there's a giant in the way?
[21436.62s -> 21446.34s]  In fact, I'm gonna like right there,
[21446.34s -> 21447.38s]  but there's spikes there, aren't there?
[21448.34s -> 21451.50s]  Won't that kill me?
[21458.58s -> 21459.46s]  Bottom of the bridge.
[21459.46s -> 21460.66s]  Like right here?
[21461.62s -> 21465.88s]  Is that it?
[21466.44s -> 21467.40s]  And is that the right way?
[21472.28s -> 21473.56s]  I was gonna jump over there the first time.
[21476.12s -> 21477.32s]  Just drop, don't jump.
[21478.62s -> 21479.26s]  You just...
[21479.26s -> 21479.66s]  Really?
[21480.82s -> 21481.38s]  Don't jump.
[21481.38s -> 21482.02s]  You just fall.
[21487.77s -> 21488.65s]  Just drop.
[21488.65s -> 21488.97s]  Really?
[21489.61s -> 21504.60s]  So you're talking about...
[21505.16s -> 21506.87s]  Let me just get this right.
[21507.91s -> 21509.27s]  So you're talking about just drop...
[21509.27s -> 21509.99s]  Oh, that little...
[21509.99s -> 21511.27s]  That little thing right there.
[21511.27s -> 21512.15s]  I see what you mean.
[21512.15s -> 21512.63s]  Like right...
[21512.63s -> 21513.59s]  That's what you're talking about, right?
[21514.39s -> 21516.10s]  Okay.
[21516.90s -> 21533.18s]  All right.
[21533.18s -> 21534.06s]  So now I know what that is.
[21536.58s -> 21537.86s]  Then you do a second drop.
[21540.38s -> 21541.58s]  Learning things every day here.
[21542.22s -> 21544.98s]  I haven't played Dark Souls Remastered in a long time,
[21544.98s -> 21546.26s]  but last time I played...
[21546.26s -> 21547.70s]  I only really completed Dark Souls
[21547.70s -> 21549.14s]  and played it when I streamed it.
[21549.94s -> 21553.94s]  Please get out of my way.
[21555.88s -> 21557.56s]  You're making this hard for me because I can't see.
[21557.56s -> 21558.36s]  You big giant.
[21559.08s -> 21560.54s]  Okay.
[21564.30s -> 21565.50s]  Why did you come down here?
[21571.53s -> 21573.61s]  Did you see me do that or something?
[21573.61s -> 21574.41s]  I don't understand.
[21576.36s -> 21576.84s]  Okay.
[21576.84s -> 21578.52s]  Well, that's good.
[21579.08s -> 21579.48s]  I wonder if...
[21579.48s -> 21580.20s]  Can I just go in here?
[21587.58s -> 21588.78s]  Aren't I getting close to Pinwheel?
[21592.09s -> 21593.05s]  This is Manus, right?
[21593.05s -> 21593.61s]  Oh, Nito.
[21594.87s -> 21595.83s]  There's an item down there.
[21598.06s -> 21599.66s]  Doesn't Nito like come pick you up?
[21606.81s -> 21608.41s]  You lie in the coffin, he drags you in.
[21613.62s -> 21613.86s]  All right.
[21613.86s -> 21615.14s]  So let's drop again.
[21617.98s -> 21618.38s]  But where...
[21619.02s -> 21619.74s]  I'm just going to be careful.
[21622.01s -> 21622.81s]  So drop again.
[21623.69s -> 21624.33s]  Where though?
[21624.89s -> 21625.61s]  Over there?
[21625.61s -> 21625.93s]  Okay.
[21629.06s -> 21630.18s]  And it's a cool item,
[21630.18s -> 21631.62s]  but it's definitely not the item you think it is.
[21635.18s -> 21635.50s]  All right.
[21647.06s -> 21647.86s]  Holy shit.
[21653.10s -> 21654.54s]  The giant came down.
[21655.72s -> 21656.84s]  Everybody came down.
[21660.10s -> 21660.98s]  And now...
[21660.98s -> 21662.26s]  I bad-grewed everything somehow.
[21663.46s -> 21664.10s]  Just run.
[21664.66s -> 21666.10s]  I'm not dealing with this bullshit.
[21666.10s -> 21667.38s]  Everybody just got hit by the grenade.
[21668.26s -> 21671.86s]  Don't do this to me.
[21681.78s -> 21682.74s]  Unfucking believable.
[21684.50s -> 21685.62s]  Unfucking believable.
[21687.18s -> 21687.42s]  Just...
[21688.70s -> 21693.50s]  Just big obnoxious fucks always in the way.
[21693.50s -> 21701.66s]  I'm just trying to run those boars,
[21701.66s -> 21705.50s]  the boars and the rats on this randomizer night.
[21705.50s -> 21708.86s]  They haven't done anything but just be gigantic assets
[21708.86s -> 21709.90s]  that just get in the way.
[21709.90s -> 21710.94s]  They don't do anything else.
[21710.94s -> 21711.66s]  They don't even fight you.
[21711.66s -> 21712.30s]  They don't even attack.
[21713.02s -> 21714.54s]  They just get in the fucking way.
[21715.78s -> 21717.14s]  They're just kaizo blocks.
[21717.14s -> 21718.18s]  They don't even do anything.
[21718.90s -> 21728.95s]  Don't come down here.
[21729.59s -> 21732.23s]  Is he dead?
[21747.45s -> 21747.85s]  What?
[21747.85s -> 21748.09s]  Oh.
[21748.73s -> 21755.69s]  And it's always a chef.
[21756.41s -> 21757.93s]  I'm gonna fucking kill this chef.
[21765.83s -> 21766.47s]  All right.
[21766.47s -> 21778.82s]  Are you guys ready?
[21779.38s -> 21780.79s]  I think it's time.
[21781.43s -> 21784.30s]  Here we go.
[21784.30s -> 21786.38s]  It's time for me to beat the real Pinwheel.
[21795.51s -> 21812.49s]  Who is it?
[21816.71s -> 21817.43s]  Somebody easy.
[21818.07s -> 21839.03s]  What is it?
[21839.03s -> 21839.67s]  Wait.
[21839.67s -> 21842.38s]  Doesn't this guy spawn like a hundred skeletons?
[21849.45s -> 21850.09s]  Oh no.
[21852.38s -> 21862.87s]  He...
[21862.87s -> 21863.91s]  Pinwheel, Nito.
[21864.55s -> 21867.18s]  Doesn't he do like a big explosion?
[21868.42s -> 21869.94s]  I'm not gonna be able to get away from that.
[21869.94s -> 21871.14s]  It's gonna hit me every time, I think.
[21878.60s -> 21879.56s]  There's the real enemy.
[21885.22s -> 21886.66s]  There he is.
[21886.66s -> 21895.08s]  I killed Pinwheel.
[21895.08s -> 21896.70s]  I killed Pinwheel.
[21896.70s -> 21897.42s]  That was Pinwheel.
[21897.42s -> 21899.02s]  Pinwheel was spawned and I killed Pinwheel.
[21899.02s -> 21906.14s]  I win.
[21906.14s -> 21906.94s]  Sorry, guys.
[21906.94s -> 21907.66s]  That's how it works.
[21908.22s -> 21910.74s]  I died to Nito.
[21910.74s -> 21912.10s]  I killed Pinwheel.
[21912.10s -> 21915.77s]  That's a victory.
[21915.77s -> 21926.34s]  I missed.
[21927.34s -> 21928.38s]  If it wasn't, fuck.
[21928.38s -> 21929.18s]  I already won.
[21929.18s -> 21930.14s]  I already won.
[21930.14s -> 21931.66s]  Now that stream's over.
[21932.22s -> 21932.94s]  I killed Pinwheel.
[21935.69s -> 21936.65s]  The giant was in the way.
[21936.65s -> 21937.29s]  I couldn't see.
[21939.05s -> 21939.93s]  It's over.
[21939.93s -> 21940.49s]  I beat him.
[21942.70s -> 21943.42s]  You all saw it.
[21943.42s -> 21944.38s]  I don't need any more proof.
[21946.47s -> 21948.31s]  The name tag said Pinwheel.
[21948.31s -> 21949.19s]  I killed Pinwheel.
[21960.49s -> 21961.61s]  He nudged me a little bit.
[21963.72s -> 21966.76s]  Why does he have to be standing in the exact place that I won?
[21986.57s -> 21988.33s]  Have I eaten a McChicken yet?
[21988.33s -> 21988.97s]  Yeah.
[21988.97s -> 21989.69s]  Yeah, I have.
[21989.69s -> 21990.19s]  Yes.
[22023.10s -> 22026.54s]  I can't kill Nito with like in 30 seconds.
[22028.22s -> 22028.70s]  All right, here we go.
[22028.70s -> 22036.34s]  I have to kill Nito in like 12 seconds with like 30% health.
[22061.93s -> 22062.81s]  Got him.
[22062.81s -> 22064.33s]  No, you don't get to say shit.
[22064.33s -> 22071.62s]  You thought it was going to happen, but it didn't.
[22071.62s -> 22073.70s]  I just want to close the book on this.
[22079.27s -> 22080.71s]  All right, the book is closing on this.
[22084.15s -> 22086.23s]  If I wasn't toxic, and you know what?
[22086.23s -> 22088.87s]  I'm going to dump a humanity into this.
[22091.54s -> 22092.42s]  Who really cares?
[22092.42s -> 22093.94s]  I'm just going to take three humanities.
[22094.58s -> 22105.13s]  I have to at least try.
[22105.77s -> 22120.65s]  I cannot do this twice, right?
[22127.70s -> 22128.34s]  Summon help?
[22129.22s -> 22144.15s]  I don't think I want to go online with this because it might be bad.
[22148.66s -> 22150.90s]  All right, please just get out of the way.
[22150.90s -> 22152.10s]  No toxic bullshit.
[22152.98s -> 22156.01s]  There it is.
[22156.73s -> 22158.66s]  He's going to try to smash me.
[22158.66s -> 22159.30s]  Don't let him.
[22159.30s -> 22160.66s]  Yep, I knew it was coming.
[22161.38s -> 22165.30s]  Why am I online?
[22165.86s -> 22180.52s]  That's an NPC.
[22181.08s -> 22184.15s]  Here we go.
[22184.15s -> 22184.79s]  All right, let's try.
[22185.35s -> 22220.82s]  Is there enough room?
[22221.94s -> 22236.81s]  I just barely have to go all the way to the end.
[22236.81s -> 22237.61s]  Is there enough room?
[22239.62s -> 22240.50s]  God damn it.
[22240.50s -> 22241.06s]  It's close.
[22241.70s -> 22242.90s]  I got to keep him at this side.
[22243.62s -> 22255.29s]  I think this is too close.
[22255.29s -> 22255.77s]  I'm dead.
[22256.33s -> 22259.62s]  Oh, that sucks.
[22260.34s -> 22278.84s]  See, I already killed the pinwheel so he's not spawning.
[22308.50s -> 22323.98s]  This is too many.
[22323.98s -> 22327.34s]  There's like 15 pinwheels in that room.
[22327.34s -> 22328.14s]  So yes, guys.
[22328.70s -> 22334.38s]  Yes, I died to a room that had Nito and 15 pinwheels in it.
[22334.38s -> 22335.18s]  All right?
[22335.18s -> 22336.30s]  Yeah, sure.
[22336.30s -> 22337.58s]  I will take that loss.
[22337.58s -> 22348.90s]  That's okay, but it's not even real.
[22348.90s -> 22350.26s]  Thanks for watching, everybody.
[22350.26s -> 22351.54s]  Hope you have a happy Fourth of July.
[22353.14s -> 22355.46s]  They die in one hit, but that doesn't matter.
[22359.85s -> 22361.77s]  Yeah, ants die in one hit too.
[22361.77s -> 22364.01s]  But if there's a thousand of them, you're gonna die.
[22374.97s -> 22377.45s]  If you get swarmed by like two or three thousand ants,
[22377.45s -> 22378.01s]  you're dead.
[22378.01s -> 22378.89s]  You're gonna die.
[22378.89s -> 22380.57s]  You're gonna get like stung in the face and shit.
[22381.54s -> 22382.18s]  Oh my god.
[22382.18s -> 22383.30s]  All right, the stream's actually over.
[22385.88s -> 22387.00s]  I can't attempt this again.
[22392.33s -> 22394.41s]  He was deposing.
[22402.20s -> 22403.08s]  All right, that's it.
[22403.08s -> 22403.48s]  That's it.
[22403.48s -> 22405.32s]  I am not doing it anymore.
[22415.88s -> 22416.52s]  Didn't puke.
[22419.78s -> 22420.34s]  I just did.
[22423.64s -> 22424.44s]  Fuck you, man.
[22455.80s -> 22456.60s]  Why did I just do that?
[22477.11s -> 22478.15s]  All right, quiet time.
[22479.19s -> 22479.59s]  Here we go.
[22480.66s -> 22481.62s]  Real attempt.
[22481.62s -> 22525.93s]  How the fuck am I not hitting this guy?
[22527.29s -> 22531.43s]  Okay, here come the pinwheels.
[22532.07s -> 22560.22s]  Oh shit, I'm gonna get hit by this.
[22560.22s -> 22583.72s]  I gotta tank one.
[22583.72s -> 22584.84s]  Look, look, what do you mean look?
[22585.48s -> 22587.66s]  What am I looking at?
[22587.66s -> 22588.46s]  Why am I looking at chat?
[22594.71s -> 22598.52s]  Pinwheel is officially dead.
[22609.05s -> 22615.75s]  I did not lose to pinwheel.
[22615.75s -> 22618.15s]  Three tries to beat the real pinwheel.
[22622.68s -> 22626.52s]  Hey, now I'm like satisfied and I can turn this stream off.
[22626.52s -> 22627.00s]  That's it.
[22627.64s -> 22632.87s]  That was Dark Souls randomizer items and enemies and bosses and shit.
[22634.06s -> 22634.78s]  It was really fun.
[22635.66s -> 22637.02s]  It was a little ridiculous,
[22637.02s -> 22639.80s]  but you can probably hear some of the fireworks right now.
[22640.60s -> 22644.87s]  People uh, July 3rd and July 4th.
[22646.92s -> 22647.56s]  Uh, that's gonna be it.
[22647.56s -> 22648.60s]  I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[22649.16s -> 22649.80s]  I'll let you know.
[22649.80s -> 22650.52s]  Check the sus.
[22650.52s -> 22651.96s]  It'll probably be either Friday or Saturday.
[22654.25s -> 22660.25s]  And we got 20 community subs from cyanide and five from play for doctor.
[22662.07s -> 22662.79s]  Thank you both of you.
[22662.79s -> 22663.59s]  Thank you cyanide.
[22663.59s -> 22665.91s]  That's hundreds of dollars at this point, right?
[22666.55s -> 22668.23s]  That's like 50 community subs tonight.
[22669.83s -> 22671.83s]  Jesus.
[22671.83s -> 22672.23s]  Thank you.
[22677.06s -> 22678.18s]  Happy 4th of July.
[22678.18s -> 22679.06s]  I'll see you real soon.
[22679.62s -> 22683.82s]  Will I do a Dark Souls 3 randomizer?
[22683.98s -> 22686.06s]  I did a lot of weird Dark Souls 3 stuff before.
[22687.10s -> 22695.29s]  I was played as bosses and times 20 speed and slow motion.
[22695.29s -> 22696.49s]  I had a lot of mods before.
[22697.46s -> 22700.58s]  First person mod, which was really fun until you get to a boss.
[22705.56s -> 22713.02s]  But yeah, you can find these on uh, the Nexus mods guy has a page.
[22713.74s -> 22718.58s]  But yeah, thanks everybody.
[22718.58s -> 22719.06s]  See you soon.
[22719.06s -> 22719.78s]  We're going to do the bits.
[22720.66s -> 22721.54s]  Hope you enjoyed it.
[22721.54s -> 22723.62s]  That was exactly what I thought it was going to be.
[22726.81s -> 22728.58s]  It was a lot of fun.
[22728.58s -> 22729.70s]  Do Dark Souls 2.
[22730.26s -> 22742.65s]  What am I doing tomorrow?
[22742.65s -> 22744.89s]  Me and Kim are going to go.
[22744.89s -> 22749.53s]  We're probably going to be just somewhere in Vegas to see the fireworks.
[22750.17s -> 22757.16s]  Because I'm pretty sure they do like a pretty big display at every major casino
[22757.16s -> 22758.44s]  and resort and stuff.
[22758.44s -> 22759.56s]  So I think we're gonna go see it.
[22760.44s -> 22772.07s]  But let's go back to earlier this afternoon.
[22774.65s -> 22776.41s]  We had snoozing copter with 250.
[22777.21s -> 22778.17s]  Thank you snoozing copter.
[22779.19s -> 22781.03s]  Can't watch for long because I work tomorrow.
[22781.03s -> 22783.75s]  I know we are obligated to watch, but I can't.
[22783.75s -> 22784.63s]  I'm sorry.
[22784.63s -> 22786.23s]  Please don't ban me like all the others.
[22786.87s -> 22789.83s]  Anyway, years back, you told us about a smoothie drink you made every morning.
[22789.83s -> 22791.99s]  The only thing I remember was frozen strawberries, I think.
[22792.55s -> 22794.23s]  What are the other ingredients?
[22794.23s -> 22796.71s]  Also, when was the last time you actually went to the gym?
[22796.71s -> 22799.03s]  I'm curious because you still look like you're in shape.
[22802.78s -> 22804.86s]  Well, the you're talking about banana.
[22806.22s -> 22811.35s]  So Greek yogurt, a banana, strawberries,
[22811.99s -> 22817.51s]  and coconut water or milk or almond milk.
[22817.51s -> 22818.79s]  I would not do regular milk.
[22819.43s -> 22823.35s]  I would do a lighter milk because the banana and the yogurt is already really heavy.
[22823.35s -> 22824.63s]  You don't want to really weigh it down.
[22825.43s -> 22828.74s]  I used to drink that all the time.
[22836.54s -> 22837.34s]  Doctors hate them.
[22839.27s -> 22843.35s]  Or if you want to do peanut butter, peanut butter and banana
[22844.66s -> 22848.18s]  with the same base of that Greek yogurt and almond milk.
[22848.90s -> 22851.64s]  Not as heavy.
[22851.64s -> 22852.52s]  It tastes awesome.
[22853.16s -> 22858.52s]  You can throw in some whey protein, too, if you really wanted to.
[22859.40s -> 22862.31s]  Almond milk is bad.
[22862.31s -> 22863.67s]  I can't drink it straight.
[22863.67s -> 22866.31s]  Yeah, but almond milk is really, really good to mix with a bunch of other stuff.
[22866.95s -> 22871.45s]  Almond milk tastes the most like milk to me
[22871.45s -> 22874.73s]  when it's mixed with other things that you usually would mix milk with stuff.
[22878.55s -> 22881.99s]  It's a good milk substitute for a lot of things that require milk.
[22882.63s -> 22887.26s]  I just said the same thing,
[22888.22s -> 22890.70s]  but the second time I actually made it a coherent state.
[22891.42s -> 22894.12s]  I translated it for you.
[22894.84s -> 22898.70s]  But now I haven't been to the gym in a while.
[22900.38s -> 22901.50s]  I walk around a lot, though.
[22902.50s -> 22904.18s]  It's so nice out over here.
[22904.18s -> 22905.54s]  It's so hot out every day.
[22906.73s -> 22910.17s]  I kind of make it a mission to at least get outside and move around and walk around.
[22911.05s -> 22915.05s]  So I do stay active, but I'm not lifting weights anymore.
[22916.47s -> 22918.23s]  My back is all fucked up.
[22918.23s -> 22919.43s]  I can't really can't do it anymore.
[22920.15s -> 22927.82s]  I don't know.
[22927.82s -> 22929.18s]  Something happened like a couple years ago
[22929.18s -> 22931.02s]  and I just started to get really tight back there.
[22931.02s -> 22933.90s]  So it's hard to really do much lifting-wise.
[22933.90s -> 22935.18s]  I mean, if I can move around, fine.
[22935.18s -> 22936.54s]  I can run.
[22936.54s -> 22937.18s]  I can jump.
[22937.18s -> 22937.90s]  I can dash.
[22937.90s -> 22938.54s]  I can slide.
[22939.58s -> 22945.59s]  But lifting weights is kind of like off the table, I would say.
[22949.94s -> 22950.58s]  Triple jump?
[22950.58s -> 22952.42s]  Nah, I can double jump, though.
[22954.60s -> 22956.20s]  But C4G, thanks for the 250.
[22956.20s -> 22957.88s]  Ignore that last guy and ban them.
[22958.44s -> 22963.90s]  We don't ban anybody here unless they do something wrong.
[22963.90s -> 22964.86s]  Or they break a rule.
[22965.58s -> 22968.31s]  Or I just look at you and go, you're out.
[22969.03s -> 22971.38s]  Or if you make fun of me.
[22971.38s -> 22974.98s]  Or if you backseat too much.
[22974.98s -> 22978.18s]  Or if you disrespect somebody in the chat.
[22978.82s -> 22981.86s]  We don't ban anybody here unless you do any of those things.
[22981.86s -> 22987.69s]  How much did you bench?
[22987.69s -> 22990.25s]  I used to back in the day.
[22990.25s -> 22992.49s]  Somewhere around like 2011, 2012.
[22993.53s -> 22997.10s]  I could do like 215.
[22997.98s -> 22999.18s]  Like three or four times.
[22999.74s -> 23000.70s]  And then I had to put it up.
[23002.39s -> 23003.51s]  I also weighed.
[23005.06s -> 23007.06s]  I was a lot heavier than I am now.
[23008.46s -> 23012.06s]  I topped, I think I was like 165 or like 170 or something.
[23012.06s -> 23016.94s]  168 when I was at my most stacked up human.
[23019.02s -> 23022.58s]  I think like two, it was over 200.
[23022.58s -> 23024.18s]  I know it was at least like 200, 215.
[23024.18s -> 23025.94s]  That I did at least two or three, like four times.
[23028.87s -> 23030.63s]  They say as long as you can do your body weight,
[23031.70s -> 23032.82s]  then that's pretty good.
[23032.82s -> 23033.70s]  That's actually really good.
[23034.58s -> 23038.79s]  I've since come way down.
[23038.79s -> 23041.75s]  I mean I'm probably like 155 pounds now.
[23041.75s -> 23043.83s]  154 maybe.
[23048.94s -> 23051.56s]  Yeah, I was 168.
[23052.20s -> 23053.72s]  I'm now like 150.
[23054.52s -> 23055.50s]  Maybe a little bit more.
[23056.14s -> 23058.70s]  That's great for your weight.
[23058.70s -> 23059.58s]  Oh yeah, man.
[23059.58s -> 23064.94s]  I used to do 35 pound dumbbells to curl with.
[23065.66s -> 23068.17s]  I don't think I could do with two hands.
[23068.17s -> 23071.05s]  Pick up a 35 pound dumbbell and put it over my head right now.
[23071.61s -> 23073.69s]  I think back at the shit that I was doing and I'm going,
[23073.69s -> 23075.29s]  how the how did I do that?
[23076.01s -> 23077.69s]  I can't even pick up one.
[23078.65s -> 23086.79s]  I was really into it though.
[23088.26s -> 23089.78s]  I was super passionate about it.
[23089.78s -> 23090.90s]  I was really into it.
[23090.90s -> 23094.66s]  I was super into being healthy and eating really, really good
[23094.66s -> 23097.38s]  and going to the gym and doing it right.
[23097.38s -> 23099.06s]  Trying to do as good form as I can.
[23100.92s -> 23103.56s]  Going four or five days a week.
[23103.56s -> 23104.76s]  Not working the same muscle groups.
[23104.76s -> 23106.36s]  I'm talking Monday is chest.
[23106.92s -> 23110.12s]  You know, Tuesday is what you usually do.
[23110.12s -> 23112.60s]  Like chest and tris back and bis is what you do.
[23113.64s -> 23117.30s]  And then you give your day of rest and you come back and do legs.
[23118.26s -> 23119.38s]  You do back core.
[23120.02s -> 23122.62s]  I was out of the gym four or five days a week.
[23123.42s -> 23129.99s]  I was so into it, but you kind of have to be
[23129.99s -> 23132.47s]  to be able to have like real results.
[23132.47s -> 23135.03s]  If you want to be, oh, you know, I want to get jacked.
[23136.25s -> 23139.05s]  It becomes a part-time job that you have to fulfill.
[23140.54s -> 23142.70s]  And it got to the point where I started caring more about
[23144.17s -> 23145.77s]  hanging out and making a YouTube video
[23145.77s -> 23147.37s]  than going to the gym for three hours.
[23148.09s -> 23150.68s]  So really it was making YouTube videos
[23150.84s -> 23152.84s]  is what kept me back in the house.
[23152.84s -> 23154.68s]  And I was like, no, I don't feel like doing that.
[23154.68s -> 23156.36s]  I want to play like GTA four.
[23160.15s -> 23161.35s]  I became a gamer.
[23161.35s -> 23165.30s]  Yeah, but it's all good.
[23165.30s -> 23168.12s]  I started, I still try to save as healthy as I can.
[23171.30s -> 23174.70s]  You can be healthy without lifting weights.
[23174.70s -> 23177.21s]  As long as you keep yourself fairly active
[23177.21s -> 23178.73s]  and you eat right, you'll be all right.
[23181.34s -> 23186.36s]  But thank you to C4G again, C4G again for the 250.
[23186.36s -> 23187.32s]  Also bots back.
[23187.32s -> 23188.28s]  Thanks for clearing it up.
[23188.92s -> 23190.84s]  Here's the stats of some previous streams.
[23190.84s -> 23198.31s]  If you are curious, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[23198.31s -> 23199.27s]  What happened?
[23199.27s -> 23201.03s]  Oh, I know this is this.
[23201.03s -> 23201.91s]  I love data.
[23202.79s -> 23203.83s]  This is awesome.
[23208.26s -> 23210.02s]  I want to go over these because this is great.
[23213.43s -> 23214.39s]  Let's go over these charts.
[23214.95s -> 23222.90s]  I'm going to put them on the screen.
[23224.31s -> 23228.47s]  So we've got these are the amount of plus twos and minus twos
[23228.47s -> 23229.75s]  and it's in a chart sense.
[23230.31s -> 23233.38s]  Let's get them on the screen so you can see.
[23233.38s -> 23241.37s]  This is very interesting.
[23241.37s -> 23247.30s]  Here we go.
[23247.30s -> 23248.02s]  There's another one.
[23248.82s -> 23250.26s]  There's three in total here.
[23251.22s -> 23258.01s]  This one is great.
[23258.57s -> 23259.61s]  This is my favorite one.
[23260.33s -> 23263.58s]  All right.
[23263.58s -> 23265.90s]  So this is the deep rock galactic stream.
[23267.56s -> 23271.88s]  So as you notice, there's a huge decline in the very beginning here.
[23272.84s -> 23276.28s]  And the reason for that is because the stream started
[23276.28s -> 23280.04s]  and once we got going, Star and I pretended
[23280.92s -> 23284.54s]  that we were just going to sit there silent playing the game.
[23284.54s -> 23285.26s]  We were doing the...
[23286.14s -> 23286.78s]  Yeah, what do you got?
[23287.58s -> 23288.81s]  Yeah, send it over here.
[23289.45s -> 23293.08s]  Okay, yeah, we did that for about a half an hour.
[23295.18s -> 23295.98s]  Everybody hated it.
[23295.98s -> 23296.70s]  Let's see.
[23296.70s -> 23298.86s]  I mean, people thought it was absolutely terrible.
[23301.00s -> 23301.88s]  And we came right back.
[23301.88s -> 23303.08s]  We bounced right back.
[23303.96s -> 23306.76s]  I think I fell off the cliff and that's where it just jumped.
[23309.90s -> 23310.86s]  It was like five minutes.
[23310.86s -> 23312.46s]  Yeah, well, I'm embellishing.
[23313.40s -> 23316.52s]  And then near the end here when we started to do the soundboard stuff
[23317.90s -> 23318.54s]  really picked up.
[23318.54s -> 23319.26s]  That's really funny.
[23319.26s -> 23320.30s]  But this one, this is...
[23320.30s -> 23320.78s]  What's this one?
[23320.78s -> 23321.90s]  This is the Mario Maker.
[23322.78s -> 23324.82s]  So this is Mario Maker.
[23324.82s -> 23328.82s]  So what happened in the middle that was so funny?
[23330.42s -> 23331.94s]  And then what happened at the...
[23331.94s -> 23334.18s]  Somewhere an hour before the end of the stream
[23334.18s -> 23336.18s]  where it was like, holy shit, I hate this.
[23336.18s -> 23339.14s]  And then we bounced way back near the end.
[23340.10s -> 23341.54s]  This is all over the place.
[23342.26s -> 23350.33s]  It was the car.
[23350.97s -> 23359.19s]  That's so funny.
[23361.88s -> 23364.20s]  Oh, the McChicken was right at the end.
[23364.20s -> 23365.64s]  Right there at the very end.
[23366.28s -> 23387.03s]  And this last one was Space Engine and Cook Serve Delicious.
[23389.69s -> 23390.97s]  I don't know what happened here.
[23394.47s -> 23396.07s]  Still at minus 50.
[23396.07s -> 23398.07s]  Well, these are only three that were taken.
[23398.07s -> 23398.71s]  There's a lot.
[23400.89s -> 23402.33s]  This was a really funny stream.
[23403.05s -> 23407.75s]  I think the Flush joke happened, right?
[23407.75s -> 23408.55s]  See that first peak?
[23409.35s -> 23414.55s]  Yo, then I said...
[23414.55s -> 23415.03s]  Yeah, you're right.
[23415.03s -> 23415.59s]  I said, Shpee.
[23416.92s -> 23419.16s]  Somewhere in there I said Shpee and we rocketed.
[23419.16s -> 23420.92s]  We went parabolic after I said Shpee.
[23421.80s -> 23425.74s]  There was no stopping it.
[23425.74s -> 23433.14s]  That's interesting though.
[23440.06s -> 23440.86s]  So what was today?
[23444.70s -> 23445.50s]  7.42.
[23446.14s -> 23449.72s]  So what was yesterday?
[23449.72s -> 23450.76s]  And do we have any idea?
[23452.04s -> 23456.70s]  That's not bad.
[23457.77s -> 23458.97s]  Yesterday was like 500.
[23464.47s -> 23465.75s]  Oh yeah, it was off yesterday, right?
[23466.47s -> 23469.70s]  That's so funny.
[23469.70s -> 23470.42s]  That's great though.
[23470.42s -> 23472.10s]  Thanks for the charts.
[23472.10s -> 23472.90s]  It's funny to look at.
[23472.90s -> 23475.85s]  It's interesting just to see what works
[23475.85s -> 23477.45s]  and what doesn't in real time almost.
[23477.45s -> 23478.01s]  It's interesting.
[23479.43s -> 23480.47s]  But thanks for the 250.
[23481.77s -> 23483.77s]  Thank you, S10W Update for the $5.
[23484.73s -> 23487.29s]  Hey, Jerma985 of the hit YouTube channel,
[23487.29s -> 23488.17s]  Jerma985.
[23488.17s -> 23489.53s]  Back to donate here again after...
[23490.41s -> 23492.49s]  Even after the horrifying McChicken eating.
[23492.49s -> 23493.93s]  Hope to donate lots more now
[23493.93s -> 23495.61s]  and good luck with life.
[23495.61s -> 23496.11s]  Enjoy.
[23501.46s -> 23502.74s]  Those McChickens were pretty good.
[23505.08s -> 23506.04s]  What am I gonna eat tonight?
[23507.00s -> 23507.72s]  Something healthy.
[23508.28s -> 23509.72s]  I'm talking about lifting weights
[23509.72s -> 23510.44s]  and being at the gym.
[23510.44s -> 23511.64s]  I need to eat something good.
[23512.36s -> 23519.46s]  I'll think about that.
[23519.46s -> 23521.78s]  But thank you for the $5, S10W Update.
[23521.78s -> 23522.28s]  Appreciate it.
[23523.78s -> 23525.06s]  I will do my best.
[23525.86s -> 23528.06s]  Good luck with your life too.
[23530.14s -> 23531.34s]  Jerma lied about Taco Bell.
[23531.34s -> 23532.06s]  Thanks for the $3.
[23532.06s -> 23532.54s]  Hey, Jerma.
[23532.54s -> 23533.74s]  Can't stick around for the whole stream
[23533.74s -> 23534.86s]  but I just saw Spider-Man.
[23535.50s -> 23536.38s]  No spoilers.
[23536.38s -> 23538.30s]  But it was a super good movie.
[23538.94s -> 23543.26s]  I heard it was fantastic.
[23547.69s -> 23549.69s]  Yeah, I'm not gonna read anymore.
[23549.69s -> 23550.17s]  I don't...
[23550.17s -> 23551.61s]  I know there's no spoilers in this message
[23551.61s -> 23552.89s]  but I don't want to even say the words...
[23554.25s -> 23554.73s]  That word.
[23554.73s -> 23557.29s]  The guy that is the bug with eight legs.
[23558.17s -> 23560.34s]  But I heard it is fantastic.
[23565.29s -> 23566.89s]  Thank you, Jerma lied about Taco Bell.
[23566.89s -> 23568.57s]  I'm actually looking forward to seeing it.
[23568.81s -> 23570.49s]  I heard it was really good.
[23572.76s -> 23573.48s]  Sol Harv.
[23573.48s -> 23574.36s]  Thanks for the $2.50.
[23574.92s -> 23575.32s]  Hey, Jerma.
[23575.32s -> 23576.44s]  For your next burger eating stream,
[23576.44s -> 23580.20s]  may I suggest reviewing the new Cheetos and chicken burger from KFC?
[23580.20s -> 23583.24s]  It goes great with a cup of coffee to wash it down.
[23583.96s -> 23588.89s]  I feel like that's the only opportunity I'm ever gonna have
[23589.45s -> 23592.25s]  to solidify that joke in history forever.
[23597.22s -> 23600.98s]  Do I eat the KFC Cheetos chicken sandwich
[23601.54s -> 23602.74s]  and drink a black coffee?
[23604.02s -> 23605.14s]  Just to even take a bite?
[23605.14s -> 23606.66s]  Just so I can have it on camera
[23606.66s -> 23607.62s]  and know that I did it.
[23608.42s -> 23611.18s]  That'll be the next eating food embarrassing stream.
[23611.90s -> 23612.78s]  We'll see when that happens.
[23615.40s -> 23616.44s]  Jerma lied about Taco Bell.
[23616.44s -> 23617.32s]  Thanks for the $2.50.
[23617.32s -> 23618.28s]  They say Jerma Defoe.
[23619.94s -> 23622.70s]  Jerma Defoe.
[23622.70s -> 23625.37s]  Thank you.
[23625.37s -> 23625.85s]  Do it quick.
[23625.85s -> 23626.97s]  It might be a limited time thing.
[23626.97s -> 23627.37s]  You're right.
[23628.09s -> 23628.73s]  I'll do it soon.
[23629.98s -> 23630.70s]  Oh, Rijian.
[23630.70s -> 23631.66s]  Thanks for the $3.50.
[23631.66s -> 23633.50s]  Jerma, why are you such a psycho
[23633.50s -> 23636.46s]  hurting these innocent kittens and workers?
[23636.46s -> 23638.14s]  How would you like it if I walked into your office
[23638.14s -> 23639.50s]  and stabbed you midstream?
[23641.96s -> 23642.52s]  Here's the thing.
[23642.52s -> 23644.60s]  I don't work in a dungeon.
[23645.40s -> 23648.68s]  With bones everywhere and bodies and urns.
[23650.30s -> 23652.06s]  I haven't eaten three people today.
[23655.03s -> 23656.39s]  Some of the fucking monsters out here
[23656.39s -> 23658.79s]  have eaten people in the last four hours.
[23658.79s -> 23659.51s]  I haven't done that.
[23660.23s -> 23666.39s]  You hear that?
[23666.39s -> 23670.87s]  Hold on.
[23670.87s -> 23672.86s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[23672.86s -> 23675.37s]  Oh, what the hell?
[23675.37s -> 23676.33s]  It was just getting started.
[23682.87s -> 23684.23s]  It's fireworks.
[23684.23s -> 23685.43s]  It's the 4th of July.
[23686.71s -> 23688.63s]  Well, it's the 4th of July eve.
[23689.19s -> 23691.03s]  Don't you guys know that 4th of July
[23691.03s -> 23696.47s]  means a week before and four months after
[23696.47s -> 23698.39s]  people still do fireworks?
[23698.39s -> 23699.27s]  That's how it works.
[23699.99s -> 23708.50s]  But thank you, Rijian, for the $3.50.
[23715.16s -> 23717.64s]  Cyanide Zero gave a ton of subs.
[23717.64s -> 23719.16s]  I think at least 40 or 50 of them
[23719.16s -> 23720.04s]  over the course of the stream.
[23720.60s -> 23721.40s]  Hundreds of dollars.
[23721.40s -> 23722.36s]  Thank you, Cyanide.
[23725.10s -> 23726.46s]  Is Otto okay with fireworks?
[23726.46s -> 23727.10s]  Yeah, he's okay.
[23727.90s -> 23729.42s]  He's not bad with loud noises
[23729.42s -> 23731.82s]  or consistent popping, cracking sounds.
[23732.78s -> 23734.38s]  During thunderstorms, he's fine.
[23735.99s -> 23736.39s]  Hold on.
[23736.95s -> 23738.44s]  Do it again.
[23739.00s -> 23740.42s]  Do it again.
[23742.58s -> 23747.21s]  I actually got fireworks are legal in Nevada.
[23747.21s -> 23751.05s]  So Kim and I have some sparklers
[23751.05s -> 23752.49s]  and some little spinny things.
[23752.49s -> 23755.62s]  And probably going to just play with them.
[23755.62s -> 23760.84s]  That's one thing.
[23760.84s -> 23762.92s]  Fireworks were always illegal in Massachusetts.
[23762.92s -> 23763.72s]  And it was always like,
[23763.72s -> 23765.32s]  oh, look at all these fireworks.
[23765.32s -> 23767.16s]  Oh, we can't really do anything.
[23769.10s -> 23772.66s]  I'm not even sure sparklers are legal
[23772.66s -> 23774.58s]  to buy or own in Massachusetts.
[23775.14s -> 23781.83s]  I don't know why.
[23782.39s -> 23787.19s]  Because I know that there's like three
[23787.19s -> 23788.55s]  different types of fireworks, right?
[23788.55s -> 23791.05s]  There is no fireworks.
[23791.05s -> 23791.85s]  Fireworks are legal.
[23792.41s -> 23796.01s]  There's fireworks that cannot go into the air or explode.
[23796.01s -> 23797.45s]  They call them safe and sane.
[23798.09s -> 23800.54s]  Those are legal in Nevada.
[23800.54s -> 23803.90s]  So you can't know aerials and no explosions.
[23804.54s -> 23807.91s]  Everything else is able to be purchased here.
[23807.91s -> 23816.20s]  That's the same thing in New York.
[23816.76s -> 23824.31s]  Yeah, it's like that everywhere.
[23824.31s -> 23825.75s]  There's only a few states, I think,
[23825.75s -> 23827.27s]  in the United States that even allow
[23827.99s -> 23832.15s]  the purchase and sale of aerial fireworks
[23832.15s -> 23834.47s]  and firecrackers and Roman candles.
[23835.67s -> 23836.23s]  I don't know.
[23836.23s -> 23837.03s]  There's not very many.
[23840.23s -> 23842.55s]  Way more states in the United States
[23842.55s -> 23846.71s]  have sort of put a leash on fireworks.
[23852.86s -> 23854.14s]  But yeah, you'll probably hear it
[23854.14s -> 23855.02s]  a few times in the background.
[23855.90s -> 23857.58s]  Sir Black Mage, thanks for the 250.
[23857.58s -> 23858.30s]  There's a clip here.
[23858.30s -> 23859.02s]  I wonder what it is.
[23861.00s -> 23863.24s]  German admits he is afraid of pinwheel.
[23866.41s -> 23867.53s]  Yeah, I am afraid of pinwheel.
[23872.38s -> 23873.34s]  I did say that.
[23874.44s -> 23876.36s]  But you have to give me the context of
[23876.92s -> 23878.52s]  I'm afraid of 100 pinwheels.
[23879.16s -> 23881.96s]  Are you afraid of one Nito-sized pinwheel
[23881.96s -> 23884.92s]  or 100 duck-sized pinwheels?
[23884.92s -> 23886.28s]  Whatever the thing is that people say.
[23887.24s -> 23887.88s]  It doesn't matter.
[23894.28s -> 23898.28s]  Thank you to Sir Canine for the five dollars.
[23898.28s -> 23899.16s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[23899.16s -> 23901.32s]  Welcome to episode one of Dark Souls Randomizer,
[23901.32s -> 23903.00s]  the series where I play Dark Souls.
[23903.00s -> 23905.00s]  This is going to be a single-player let's play.
[23905.00s -> 23905.88s]  And when I say let's play,
[23905.88s -> 23907.08s]  I use that term pretty loosely
[23907.08s -> 23908.92s]  because I am an idiot in this game.
[23908.92s -> 23910.20s]  You're going to see lots of fails.
[23910.20s -> 23911.40s]  You're going to see lots of cheating,
[23911.96s -> 23913.24s]  at least I'm hoping.
[23913.24s -> 23915.16s]  So grab yourself a nice cup of coffee,
[23915.16s -> 23916.60s]  a nice hot cup of cocoa.
[23916.60s -> 23918.36s]  I got apple cider here, freshly brewed.
[23918.36s -> 23919.32s]  Let me just take a sip.
[23919.88s -> 23920.92s]  Oh, that's some...
[23920.92s -> 23922.04s]  And then they ran out of space.
[23924.09s -> 23927.05s]  Thank you Kermit the Frugue for the three dollars.
[23927.05s -> 23928.17s]  Love you and your streams, Jerma.
[23928.17s -> 23929.93s]  If you're ever in the mood for more JermaCraft,
[23931.13s -> 23931.53s]  call me.
[23931.53s -> 23934.01s]  Carson said he would love for you to join
[23934.81s -> 23938.49s]  SMP Live, his big Minecraft server for streamers.
[23939.29s -> 23941.32s]  People do there.
[23941.88s -> 23947.16s]  Please Tim, but they have Shpleef.
[23948.94s -> 23949.74s]  Do they have Shpleef?
[23950.38s -> 23954.17s]  That's all I care about.
[23959.29s -> 23960.01s]  Yes, they do.
[23962.09s -> 23963.05s]  Thank you for the three bucks.
[23963.05s -> 23965.69s]  And maybe if I ever get the urge to play Minecraft,
[23965.69s -> 23966.97s]  I'll hit some people up.
[23966.97s -> 23967.37s]  We'll see.
[23968.57s -> 23969.53s]  Thank you for the three dollars.
[23970.73s -> 23972.09s]  Smelly boy, thanks for the 250.
[23972.09s -> 23974.01s]  I honestly cannot believe you allowed yourself
[23974.01s -> 23975.53s]  to be killed by Pinwheel again.
[23978.12s -> 23979.40s]  This time it was on camera.
[23980.30s -> 23983.50s]  Actually recorded broadcast live on this website.
[23985.86s -> 23987.30s]  Tar Alecran, thanks for the five dollars.
[23987.30s -> 23988.90s]  I think it's pretty obvious after watching you tonight
[23988.90s -> 23991.06s]  that you've never actually played this game.
[23991.06s -> 23992.74s]  And at the time you beat this game on stream
[23992.74s -> 23994.10s]  was actually just pre-recorded footage
[23994.10s -> 23995.70s]  with gameplay by a different streamer.
[23998.14s -> 23999.26s]  I mean it was a different,
[23999.90s -> 24001.26s]  I mean it was a different streamer.
[24002.14s -> 24003.66s]  It was me and a different day.
[24005.24s -> 24006.60s]  So it was a different me.
[24007.93s -> 24009.61s]  Every day when you wake up, it's a new you.
[24010.98s -> 24011.86s]  When you go to sleep,
[24012.98s -> 24014.98s]  you wake up as a new person, like in your brain.
[24018.09s -> 24024.26s]  Every day you get up, you're a new person.
[24024.26s -> 24026.02s]  I think you can get banned, of course.
[24026.02s -> 24026.98s]  I'm not going to say that.
[24028.34s -> 24029.86s]  But thank you Tar Alecran.
[24029.86s -> 24032.42s]  I beat Dark Souls Remastered on stream
[24032.42s -> 24034.18s]  and most recently beat Sekiro on stream
[24034.18s -> 24036.26s]  and also finished The Last Boss, The True Last Boss.
[24036.90s -> 24038.74s]  I know a lot of other YouTubers and streamers
[24038.74s -> 24041.86s]  that you may have come across gave up or said,
[24041.86s -> 24043.38s]  nah, this is too much.
[24043.38s -> 24046.58s]  Or they did it like two, three hundred tries.
[24046.58s -> 24047.54s]  I did it in 52.
[24048.10s -> 24049.38s]  I think that gives me a little bit of a right
[24049.38s -> 24053.62s]  to say these things and play Randomizer
[24053.62s -> 24055.06s]  and follow a couple of clips.
[24055.70s -> 24056.90s]  I think I get the pass there.
[24068.15s -> 24070.15s]  I missed Jerma from last Tuesday.
[24070.95s -> 24071.51s]  Where's that?
[24071.51s -> 24072.31s]  Where's that guy?
[24073.51s -> 24076.87s]  But thank you Tar Alecran for the five dollars.
[24076.87s -> 24077.43s]  Appreciate it.
[24078.15s -> 24078.95s]  Man up.
[24079.67s -> 24081.43s]  Thank you, man up for the 250.
[24081.43s -> 24082.63s]  Have a McDouble on me.
[24084.02s -> 24085.06s]  Not tonight, but I will.
[24085.62s -> 24086.10s]  Eventually.
[24087.05s -> 24087.53s]  Thank you.
[24088.17s -> 24089.85s]  That was man up with Icy Hot.
[24091.18s -> 24092.62s]  Bake me home thanks for the 250.
[24093.26s -> 24096.34s]  Sir, no, it's the same one.
[24096.34s -> 24098.02s]  Bake me home thanks for the 250.
[24098.02s -> 24099.86s]  The fax machine thanks for the 10 bucks.
[24102.01s -> 24104.33s]  Scrambled eggs are the best with the shell.
[24105.05s -> 24109.85s]  I mean, you have there's a kappa here before this.
[24111.24s -> 24113.16s]  Scrambled eggs are best with the shell.
[24114.18s -> 24116.18s]  That means it's a joke and it's not real.
[24119.78s -> 24120.66s]  Can you eat?
[24120.66s -> 24122.18s]  You can eat eggshells, can't you?
[24132.06s -> 24133.74s]  You're not like supposed to, but I think you can.
[24134.86s -> 24140.98s]  Hard boiled.
[24142.92s -> 24144.36s]  You can eat gravel too.
[24144.36s -> 24145.56s]  Yeah, but I mean, you can act.
[24151.80s -> 24153.53s]  Yeah, yep.
[24155.35s -> 24156.63s]  But thank you for the 10 dollars.
[24156.63s -> 24157.35s]  That's a lot of money.
[24157.35s -> 24157.67s]  Thank you.
[24158.39s -> 24159.27s]  The fax machine.
[24161.45s -> 24163.61s]  Let's get the credits rolling here.
[24164.41s -> 24165.77s]  There was shitload of community subs.
[24167.18s -> 24167.82s]  Throw them up.
[24171.86s -> 24172.58s]  Thank you everybody.
[24173.46s -> 24180.86s]  If you're a sub to this channel, or if you're not, either one.
[24181.42s -> 24185.27s]  Here are tonight's subs and resubs.
[24185.83s -> 24190.47s]  Much love to you.
[24190.47s -> 24193.27s]  Thank you for your continued support of this live stream.
[24197.32s -> 24199.80s]  If you play SMP live, you will be famous.
[24200.60s -> 24209.22s]  But then I'll be Minecraft famous.
[24209.78s -> 24213.10s]  Is that something I necessarily want?
[24218.54s -> 24220.22s]  That's the best kind of famous.
[24220.46s -> 24221.74s]  Is Minecraft famous?
[24227.43s -> 24229.27s]  You already are Minecraft famous.
[24229.27s -> 24231.19s]  I am not Minecraft famous.
[24232.07s -> 24233.99s]  Speaking of Minecraft, thanks for the sub, Minecraft.
[24233.99s -> 24234.55s]  Appreciate it.
[24235.83s -> 24236.79s]  How would I beat that?
[24238.60s -> 24244.04s]  I made 11 videos on Minecraft and they got like fucking 8,000 views each.
[24253.30s -> 24254.98s]  JermaCraft is how I found you.
[24259.22s -> 24264.89s]  Anyways, thank you to BakeMeHomeForThe250.
[24264.89s -> 24267.53s]  I think we got it already, but it popped up here again.
[24267.53s -> 24269.05s]  Trampston, thanks for five dollars.
[24270.01s -> 24272.33s]  McChicken part two, McChicken part two.
[24273.29s -> 24277.37s]  I'm not going to eat McChickens on stream every night.
[24277.37s -> 24279.05s]  That's not going to be a thing I'm going to do.
[24279.77s -> 24285.38s]  I mean, that's a pretty hilariously stupid thing to do at the end of your streams.
[24286.34s -> 24287.94s]  You're just the McChicken guy?
[24289.74s -> 24291.42s]  That's your live stream schtick?
[24294.57s -> 24296.73s]  I would start to feel bad every day.
[24297.53s -> 24303.43s]  People get hyped in the chat over it,
[24303.43s -> 24305.91s]  and people get really excited for the McChicken portion.
[24306.63s -> 24308.23s]  All right guys, here it comes.
[24308.79s -> 24310.55s]  I got two McChickens tonight.
[24311.19s -> 24313.45s]  Here's the McChicken portion of the stream.
[24314.17s -> 24324.34s]  Two?
[24324.34s -> 24326.26s]  Yeah, you don't just eat one McChicken.
[24326.90s -> 24335.78s]  You can't go to McDonald's and just get a double cheeseburger meal.
[24335.78s -> 24343.40s]  No, you get a double cheeseburger meal, two McChickens, a large fry, and an apple pie.
[24345.46s -> 24347.86s]  You don't just, oh yeah, I'll take a Big Mac meal and that's it.
[24347.86s -> 24348.66s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[24348.66s -> 24352.25s]  I'll take a Big Mac meal and a 10-piece nugget.
[24355.08s -> 24363.67s]  You don't just order one thing off that menu, ever, because you know it's not enough.
[24365.51s -> 24367.99s]  You know it's too much, but you also know it's not enough.
[24368.63s -> 24380.14s]  But we have a couple more here.
[24380.14s -> 24384.22s]  We have SirK9 for $2.50, all these bits, and still in Anor Londo.
[24384.86s -> 24386.73s]  Omega Low.
[24386.73s -> 24389.32s]  Omega Low, the big one.
[24390.22s -> 24391.90s]  Man up with Icy Hot, thanks for the $2.50.
[24391.90s -> 24394.38s]  I had no idea that eating burgers was a German meme now,
[24394.38s -> 24399.46s]  but you should buy a second McDouble on me, for plus two's sake.
[24400.02s -> 24408.47s]  I'm not, I gave McDonald's a two out of five last night.
[24409.11s -> 24411.27s]  You think I'm gonna be the McDonald's guy?
[24411.27s -> 24412.55s]  I told you it was gross.
[24414.04s -> 24415.48s]  At least three or four times.
[24416.12s -> 24422.58s]  2.8, 2.8 is not free, and 2.8 is not a good score.
[24422.58s -> 24423.78s]  That's still under 500.
[24424.58s -> 24426.34s]  Well, it's just not, it's just over 500.
[24426.90s -> 24427.78s]  That's not very good.
[24428.42s -> 24431.99s]  That's like getting a 58 on your math test.
[24431.99s -> 24432.63s]  That's not good.
[24437.59s -> 24438.39s]  That's still an F.
[24438.95s -> 24448.84s]  That's good for me.
[24449.48s -> 24452.73s]  Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $2.50.
[24453.45s -> 24454.44s]  Right at the end.
[24455.16s -> 24457.32s]  And thanks everybody for watching.
[24457.96s -> 24463.27s]  These last couple of streams have been kind of insanity.
[24464.54s -> 24467.18s]  So we're probably gonna dial it back a little
[24467.18s -> 24470.06s]  and relax on the stream on Friday or Saturday.
[24470.86s -> 24472.54s]  I have a couple things that I could do.
[24476.54s -> 24477.66s]  Hopefully you have enjoyed them.
[24478.22s -> 24480.49s]  I've had a lot of fun in these last couple of streams,
[24480.49s -> 24482.41s]  even though they were a lightning rod,
[24483.13s -> 24485.05s]  like times 10 energy streams.
[24485.93s -> 24486.81s]  They've still a lot of fun.
[24488.92s -> 24491.32s]  But happy 4th of July to everybody that celebrates it.
[24492.41s -> 24494.65s]  I'll be back in a couple of days.
[24495.53s -> 24499.26s]  Keep an eye on the sus as of tomorrow night
[24499.26s -> 24500.54s]  and you'll have a really good indication
[24500.54s -> 24501.66s]  of what the next stream will be.
[24503.02s -> 24503.50s]  Take care.
[24504.30s -> 24505.02s]  Much love to you.
[24505.74s -> 24507.21s]  See you really soon.
[24508.09s -> 24509.21s]  Take care, guys.
