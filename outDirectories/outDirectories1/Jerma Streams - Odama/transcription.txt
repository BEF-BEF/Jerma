[1.14s -> 12.30s]  Hey, what's up? How are you? What's going on? What's going on? Oh, it's because the AC is on.
[12.30s -> 22.95s]  Hold on a second. Oh, shit. Uh-oh. Oh, god. What the fuck? Disaster.
[25.19s -> 36.71s]  What's going on? Is my gate too low right now? Hold on. I'm gonna change this. Give me one second.
[41.26s -> 57.59s]  Is it like fucked up again? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? What is going on? Hold on,
[57.59s -> 66.07s]  listen. What? Hold on, I need to like hear this. What the fuck is this? What's this for?
[71.42s -> 77.56s]  Let me be able to hear it. I can see. Yeah, this is, this is not, you hear that? It's like
[84.98s -> 104.50s]  here. I gotta, okay, hold on. There we go. There we go. That's better. Okay. All right. Perfect.
[104.50s -> 115.72s]  We are back to normal. That was really weird. Okay. So, um, let me turn this down a little bit.
[115.72s -> 124.28s]  Just stop the stream. I'll put the audio back on for you. Okay. Hi, everybody. Welcome. Sorry
[124.28s -> 132.68s]  about that. That was a quick little change I had to do. Oh, I almost just unplugged my fucking entire
[132.68s -> 139.24s]  setup. That would have been so bad. We're gonna do something different today. Well, not really. I feel
[139.24s -> 146.31s]  like I'm the guy that has streamed every microphone video game. We're getting close. That's what we're
[146.31s -> 153.64s]  doing today. We are going to be playing. It's really not that different if you think about it.
[154.28s -> 161.00s]  We're gonna be playing a game called Old Gama, which, it could be great. It could be awful.
[161.00s -> 165.72s]  It's a game where you control troops on a battlefield with your voice while you play
[165.72s -> 175.27s]  pinball on the battlefield with a gigantic fucking boulder. So this is either pog or,
[177.18s -> 185.96s]  we'll find out. Let me change back to what I was doing. That's the first thing we're gonna do.
[185.96s -> 191.08s]  If it turns out this game is really fun and I want to play it forever, then that's what we'll do.
[191.08s -> 197.48s]  We'll just sit here for a while. But if the game sucks, then we're gonna pivot to Pokemon. That's
[197.48s -> 210.82s]  right. Pokemon. Well, I mean, not necessarily actually Pokemon. I mean, it's a Pokemon game
[210.82s -> 216.22s]  where you fucking watch TV with your Pokemon friend. It's a TV watching game. So it's not what
[216.22s -> 236.34s]  you think. But, you know, it's Pokemon React. Pokemon React. I can't wait to be like a React
[236.34s -> 243.35s]  Tuber on the Pokemon game. Anyways, um, oh, wow, this can stay on. Here's the microphone.
[243.35s -> 251.56s]  And here's, I was setting it up to make sure it worked. Hello. Hello. This is a test of the
[251.56s -> 259.26s]  microphone. It seems to be working pretty well. It works pretty well. I got the GameCube controller.
[259.26s -> 269.19s]  I think I'm ready to move. Fake voice. He's peaking his mic. Oh, fuck. No, I don't want to
[269.19s -> 276.04s]  break this. Should I lower it? I don't want to break it. If I break it, I mean, like, it really
[276.04s -> 283.18s]  fucking matters. There's like four games that utilized the GameCube mic. Two of them are Mario
[283.18s -> 290.20s]  Party. One of them is this. And the other one is a game we've already played, Chibi-Robo. I didn't
[290.20s -> 300.79s]  even know. I think there's four games that actually use this. Now, this is fine. It's not peaking the
[300.79s -> 308.70s]  mic. That just means you can hear you very well. How do you use it in Chibi-Robo? I have no idea.
[308.70s -> 316.02s]  I was actually going to look it up. All right, let's go. Can you guys hear this? Why can I not
[316.02s -> 329.66s]  hear this? I should be able to hear this. Oh, there is no sound. Oh, okay. That's like fucking
[329.66s -> 334.02s]  Resident Evil sound. This is like that. I just thought I was playing Resident Evil. That's the
[334.02s -> 343.77s]  sound it makes when you move items around in Resident Evil 1 and 2. Okay, let's go. I did a
[343.77s -> 351.58s]  little testing to make sure that this is Odama. What's with that? Why is there, what's going on
[351.58s -> 358.49s]  with this? Like the sadness right now. Why is everybody so sad? What's with the sadness?
[358.49s -> 372.78s]  Why are you guys doing sadness? Why are you guys so sad? What's fucking going on here? Oh,
[372.78s -> 376.22s]  because of the quarantine. Oh yeah, that is true. That's fucking not good.
[379.75s -> 386.39s]  All right, we'll watch the cut scene. I'll be back in a minute. Is this the opening cut scene?
[386.39s -> 399.53s]  This land has been governed by Lord Yamanouchi Nobatu. When Lord trusted Vassal with, he betrayed
[399.53s -> 406.28s]  him. Lord Yamanouchi took his own life rather than bear the shame of defeat. I feel like I'm
[406.28s -> 415.08s]  a shitty translator at like an event. Okay, and he also says, I can't wait for next year when
[415.08s -> 439.69s]  you all show up. I feel like I'm a shitty translator. I'm getting off the screen. Come back. What's
[439.69s -> 444.73s]  going on here? There are two secrets that their longtime foes knew nothing about.
[449.94s -> 460.52s]  Well, if this is an actual dub, it'd be more like this. This giant ball was said to have been
[460.52s -> 469.08s]  legend held that when unleashed in battle, the Odama could inflict untold damage to foes or
[469.08s -> 477.85s]  grant great power to allies. But these legends remain untested. The other secret was the doctrine
[477.85s -> 485.45s]  of Nintendo. The word Nintendo is formed from the first kanji of three proverbs. Ninja,
[485.45s -> 493.62s]  Mushin, attend to one's duties. Tenzai, Korin, those in heaven will descend. And Doji, Sumi,
[493.62s -> 499.22s]  moral action is a da- The way of Ninten illustrates the mindset of the Kagetori army,
[499.22s -> 505.46s]  soldiers who have entrusted themselves to the heavens. It's going too fast. It's going too fast.
[505.46s -> 510.50s]  Larry. Larry, I can't keep it up. You're going too fast. Slow the fucking thing down.
[518.89s -> 521.18s]  Remember the power of the Nintendo?
[532.46s -> 537.18s]  Dive into the dungeon of Onosamaki and your victory will ring throughout this land.
[538.94s -> 541.74s]  I'm gonna bring the can back. Just hold on. We're watching the opening cutscene.
[544.15s -> 557.43s]  You'll play this but not Nioh. Nioh does not have a comedy microphone. If Nioh was controlled with
[557.43s -> 567.96s]  a comedy mic, maybe I would consider it. This looks like a fucking e-cigar. Don't you think
[567.96s -> 573.42s]  I'm gonna like fucking just go like this and just blow a fucking cloud over here?
[573.42s -> 585.75s]  The e-cigar! Nintendo! Are we done? Wait, wasn't that just- Yes, yes, yes.
[587.03s -> 601.26s]  Let's go. Okay, I'm ready. Kuruwa Plains. Start. Now my lead. Off to battle. Why do I feel like
[601.26s -> 605.98s]  this is the Wiimote in the nunchuck? I'm the nunchuck in this scenario. I have to talk.
[606.62s -> 614.31s]  How do I do this? We must first meet our foe on the Plains of Kuruwa. Look closely, my lead.
[616.57s -> 620.41s]  The plains are bordered by hills and by the rapid flow of the Kuruwa River.
[623.13s -> 628.49s]  Okay. The enemy attempts to halt our advance at the far bank of the river.
[630.09s -> 632.97s]  We are to cross- close the floodgate first.
[633.93s -> 641.77s]  This will stop the river. Once the river is blocked, we can cross without fear.
[645.29s -> 650.25s]  Okay, we must ensure that the Ninten Bell passes through the gate at the far end of the field.
[656.15s -> 659.99s]  When do I use this? Keep as many troops as possible near the Ninten Bell.
[664.23s -> 667.51s]  As many troops as possible. Oh, almost forgot.
[670.47s -> 676.87s]  We must win this battle by sundown. Why is there like a Mario fly hat symbol button over there?
[680.55s -> 690.06s]  Hit the ghost by sundown. Hit the floodgate with the odama. All right, so it's right-
[690.94s -> 693.58s]  three, two, one. All right, here we go. It's fire- wait, it's firing?
[695.26s -> 704.41s]  Move! I'm killing my own troops. Watch out for the ball. I have to have to break the river.
[705.29s -> 713.24s]  Why is it- what am I supposed to do? Where's the ball?
[715.72s -> 725.27s]  Fall back. Send back up. More troops. I gotta break that. Did I do it?
[725.27s -> 734.23s]  What? You don't have commands? Advance? No, that's- yeah, let's practice, please.
[738.92s -> 745.88s]  Okay. Place the cursor over your men and give them your orders. Clearly into the microphone.
[745.88s -> 756.20s]  It's pinball with extra steps. Is the cursor over your men?
[760.28s -> 763.51s]  Okay, advance.
[769.99s -> 777.13s]  How do you play with both hands? This is like- this is playing games while eating simulator.
[777.13s -> 785.26s]  You know, you're like- hold on a second. Like, I can't- this is gonna be fucking impossible.
[786.50s -> 809.11s]  Fall back. Fall back. March right. March left. They're going right.
[809.11s -> 824.81s]  Please. Wait. Don't tape it to the- hold on. Don't touch this with my mouth. Did I- did I sanitize
[824.81s -> 836.86s]  this? Oh, it was in- it was in a package. It was in plastic. Okay. I think we're good. It was in
[836.86s -> 852.95s]  brand new- but this is brand new. I'm the first person to put this near their mouth. I lost. Yeah,
[852.95s -> 860.02s]  let's try it again. Wait, the ball went down. I have to start the whole fucking thing over again.
[860.02s -> 868.39s]  All right, I'm ready. Carry the ball through the gate. All right. Oh, I can aim it. Oh, let's go
[868.39s -> 877.43s]  all the way- no, no, no, no. Over here. Try to break that gate. Done. Okay, now I got commands.
[877.43s -> 885.83s]  Here we go. You have learned the command, press forward. The command orders your men to press
[885.83s -> 891.58s]  forward and repel the enemy. Place your cursor over your men and say, press forward. Your bell
[891.58s -> 899.40s]  crew will summon every last ounce of strength to push through the enemy forces. Will it still hear
[899.40s -> 915.38s]  me if I go like this? My pants are kind of loose. That went all the way down the underwear.
[915.38s -> 926.49s]  That went like straight down over- like to the underwear. Only troops who pass through the gate
[926.49s -> 930.89s]  will join you at the start of the next battle. Any troops rallied at the bell when you give the
[930.89s -> 940.38s]  order. Wait, okay, so any- you- you- press forward. All right. I have to play like pinball. All right,
[940.38s -> 969.18s]  just press forward. March left. Press forward. Fuck, I'm so bad at this. Oh, I just killed
[969.18s -> 984.58s]  everybody. Advance. Advance. Advance. Advance. Advance. The floodgate is open. The water is
[984.58s -> 992.18s]  not flowing. What? Press forward. They're coming at me. Can I hit them with the flippers?
[994.44s -> 1011.46s]  Advance. Run- crush them. Crush them. Run them over. Advance. Oh my god. Advance. Advance.
[1013.14s -> 1037.77s]  I can't trust our liege. What? Advance. Attack. Press forward. Press forward. Press forward. Yes.
[1039.21s -> 1050.18s]  Press forward. I'm trying to help you. Tell your men you love them. What just happened?
[1051.86s -> 1060.95s]  You have- you learned a command called flank and destroy. This thrilling command orders your
[1060.95s -> 1063.91s]  troops to engage the enemy. Oh, what the fuck have they been doing this whole time?
[1064.55s -> 1094.66s]  Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy. Okay. Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy.
[1095.46s -> 1115.26s]  Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. I'm killing all my own people. Advance. Advance. Prove we can trust
[1115.26s -> 1136.28s]  you. What the fuck are you talking about? What? Prove we can trust you first. Okay. What does
[1136.28s -> 1150.65s]  deploy mean? I- wait. I can- advance. Push forward. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back.
[1152.09s -> 1162.22s]  Fall back. Fall back. I didn't know I could- I didn't know this was like fucking Clash Royale.
[1164.89s -> 1188.90s]  Advance. Flank and destroy. Where are you going? What? What? What? Go forward. Fall back. I gotta
[1188.90s -> 1203.54s]  close the gate. Fall back. I gotta hit the fucking flood. Okay, here we go. Hit the- close the gate
[1203.54s -> 1237.46s]  so this is the- advance. Advance. Advance. Flank and destroy. Come on, give me more troops. What
[1237.46s -> 1253.61s]  the fuck did I just do? Get up there. Get up there. Get up there. Advance. Flank and destroy. Hit the
[1253.69s -> 1281.03s]  bell? I can't. I'm trying. Flank and destroy. Advance. Advance. Flank and destroy. Advance.
[1285.38s -> 1294.31s]  Advance. That plan sounds bad. Go in the fucking door. Go in. Why- what's with the traffic jam?
[1295.19s -> 1308.74s]  Go in. Advance. What was the plan? What am I- I already forgot what? Press forward.
[1323.38s -> 1327.86s]  What is- what is- what is advance and press forward? What's the difference?
[1327.86s -> 1333.77s]  Advance. Okay, we advance. Press forward. You go forward. That's advanced. That's advancing.
[1341.35s -> 1351.91s]  Okay, lie in the ruin before your might. Can somebody please give me an edit? Somebody please.
[1351.91s -> 1356.15s]  I know one of you will do it before the stream ends. Just- just please do this. You know exactly
[1356.15s -> 1400.41s]  what I'm looking for. You know what I want you to do. Okay? Just hold on a second. Fucking been
[1400.41s -> 1429.93s]  waiting for this shit. Kind of skipped though, right? All right, that's all I want. You know
[1429.93s -> 1441.70s]  what I want. You know what I want. That's all I care about. I don't care about anything else.
[1443.90s -> 1449.86s]  I just want- I need- I need you to do a ton of vapor coming out of my mouth. That's all I want.
[1449.86s -> 1456.58s]  I don't care. I don't- that's all I care about. Here we go.
[1456.58s -> 1464.97s]  It's coffee!
[1476.41s -> 1478.01s]  Holy shit, there's new mechanics here.
[1485.05s -> 1489.05s]  The bell crew cannot climb this hill! The bell crew!
[1489.05s -> 1498.49s]  Our troops must prepare the way by setting a ladder?
[1503.05s -> 1518.10s]  Okay. Knock the key- oh, knock the key free with the I. Three, two, one, oh fuck. Get up there.
[1519.18s -> 1533.40s]  Blank and destroy. Protect the bell. March right. Buy shit on fire. Fall back. Fall back.
[1534.28s -> 1547.90s]  Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. Oh, people just got wiped out. March left. I gotta get in there.
[1548.78s -> 1563.24s]  Fall back. Rally. Okay. This command orders your troops to gather in the area you have
[1563.24s -> 1570.07s]  highlighted with the cursor. Oh, that's- this is- this is what I'm looking for. Rally into the
[1570.07s -> 1586.31s]  microphone. Occupy enemy installations. Let's try it. Rally. All right, let me try this.
[1587.26s -> 1598.01s]  I gotta hit the key. I got another ball. Okay. How do I move the cursor? Rally. Oh, advance.
[1603.90s -> 1617.08s]  Hit that key. Fall back. There we go. Advance. There we go. Bounce it around in there.
[1619.27s -> 1635.53s]  Oops. Are my troops dead? Fall back. Fall back. Rally. Rally. Rally here to grab the- what the
[1635.61s -> 1643.75s]  fuck are you talking about? They're all on fire. I- I can't even go up there. Is it up there?
[1645.38s -> 1669.75s]  I can't even move the cursor up there. Rally. Get that key. Rally. Oh, fuck. I'm trying to just
[1669.75s -> 1686.17s]  get in there. Come on. Rally. So much friendly fire. Well, like I'm thrown on a giant pinball.
[1688.01s -> 1709.05s]  Okay. Rally. Holy shit. Rally. Get the fucking thing- Rally. Do they all need to have their own
[1709.05s -> 1731.05s]  fucking thought bubbles? Is this roller coaster tycoon? What the fuck? Rally. Rally. Rally. Rally.
[1733.02s -> 1749.56s]  Why are they not rallying? Well, we lost. Press X up- Rally. Okay. Fall back. They'll do that.
[1750.46s -> 1761.02s]  They won't fucking rally. We lost. Bad general tactics. Imagine if there's a guy just sitting
[1761.02s -> 1765.42s]  behind everybody with a fucking megaphone. Just screaming or- how could they even hear me?
[1765.42s -> 1774.65s]  No one can hear anything I'm saying. You have to go to the- I was trying to get them to go to the
[1774.65s -> 1780.41s]  ladder. They wouldn't go. I was going- Rally. Rally to the ladder. Rally. Fucking microphones.
[1781.13s -> 1789.93s]  Here we go. Place the ladder against the slope and leap. I gotta go that way. Knock the key
[1789.93s -> 1795.16s]  free with the odama to grab it. We're going right up the middle. I'm not deploying anything yet.
[1795.72s -> 1809.05s]  Destroy everything in the middle. Good. All right. Now we bring some group to burn it down. Good.
[1809.05s -> 1826.74s]  Fall back. There we go. You fucker. That was good. Advance. Fuck. I wasn't even looking at
[1826.74s -> 1834.78s]  the goddamn ball. Why are we so pushed back? Just get it flooded. Blank and destroy. Blank and destroy.
[1840.26s -> 1862.98s]  Fall back. Put me out. Can I? Blank and destroy. Look at the ball. The ball's lit up. Come on. Get
[1862.98s -> 1879.51s]  up there. Oh god damn it. Crunch. Crackle. Crunch. Crackle. What am I hitting? Advance.
[1880.23s -> 1892.89s]  No. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. No. Bounce it around. Thank you. Finally. There we go. Rally here
[1892.89s -> 1898.86s]  to grab the fucking ladder. Well why won't you go? Oh my god. I just- I think I just killed everybody.
[1902.07s -> 1916.62s]  Fall back. Where's the ball? Yes. Bounce around. Everywhere. Blank and destroy. I just killed
[1916.62s -> 1926.78s]  everybody. Okay. Get that. Get that. Rally. What are you doing? What are you- I'm trying to kill
[1926.78s -> 1950.94s]  people. Rally. Rally. They have no morale. Rally. Go get the fucking ladder. They won't even go do
[1950.94s -> 1964.20s]  this. Use the C stick? It doesn't do anything. We're all dead again. March left. Move the cursor.
[1965.08s -> 1983.03s]  I- It won't go any further to the corner. Look. It won't go any higher. D-pad? The D-pad isn't
[1983.03s -> 1999.80s]  going to do anything. Make them march to the left. Bilateral Lich 5000 bits. 50 dollars.
[1999.80s -> 2004.12s]  Jeremy, here's 50 dollars. Now march your men left and select the ladder. You have to have the bell
[2004.12s -> 2007.40s]  closer.
[2011.54s -> 2019.59s]  Thanks for the 50 dollar tip. Thanks for the actual tip. But how do- I can't advance up there
[2019.59s -> 2028.44s]  if they all fucking die. All right. Just get them all out there. Oh my god. Why is it so crunchy?
[2031.29s -> 2040.15s]  March left. This is a really good start though. This is actually a fantastic start. I killed so
[2040.15s -> 2063.72s]  much shit here. March left. March left. I still can't go up that far. March left. I can't even go
[2063.72s -> 2074.73s]  up that far still. It's all the way up there. Look at my cursor. Fall back. I can't even go
[2074.73s -> 2087.08s]  that far. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. March left. March left. They have done- they
[2087.08s -> 2101.83s]  want to listen to me anymore. Fall back. Fall back. Are they stuck? Fall back. Fall back.
[2108.70s -> 2123.59s]  Fall back. March left. Dude, it does nothing to do with the bell. Rally. I can't physically go
[2123.59s -> 2156.41s]  any higher the way the cursor is right now. Use the D-pad. Rally. Who's making fucking popcorn?
[2157.82s -> 2162.62s]  Take it out. Take it out. Take it out. You're gonna do too much. It's getting all over the stove.
[2164.01s -> 2176.25s]  All right. The ladder is in position. All right. Watch out for the ball. Advance.
[2178.73s -> 2188.34s]  Press forward. Press forward. Press forward. Get in there. Get in there. Push it back.
[2189.14s -> 2196.22s]  Look at that guy right there. That guy's like, oh shit, I hope they don't fucking see me.
[2196.22s -> 2201.58s]  I hope nobody sees me if I just stand here. I gave it like one versus a thousand. Holy shit.
[2201.58s -> 2210.46s]  I have no fucking idea what's going on, but we did it. All right. So select. It's not like use
[2210.46s -> 2229.94s]  the cursor. It's like pick the one out of two spots with the D-pad. I got 164 people. This game
[2229.94s -> 2241.43s]  is fucked up. This game is... I'll be completely honest with you guys. This game is stupid. This
[2241.43s -> 2256.30s]  game is really stupid, but I'm still interested. I still want to play it. Time for Pokemon TV. Not
[2256.30s -> 2263.62s]  yet. Not yet. Not yet. I'm still having fun. It's stupid, but it's fun. Mainly because I don't even
[2263.62s -> 2278.39s]  know half the things I'm doing. We're gonna get multiple balls here soon. All right. Now what?
[2278.39s -> 2279.91s]  All of our third battle in the distance.
[2286.15s -> 2289.99s]  Beyond those gates, we will face a general who will take all our might and cunning to defeat.
[2295.08s -> 2297.48s]  Oh, the rivers. This is going to be painful.
[2299.48s -> 2303.16s]  It's a pulley to the nearest bug that we can control the flow of that river.
[2312.20s -> 2313.64s]  This is a lot. This is too much to do.
[2313.64s -> 2333.99s]  Stick the mic up your nose. No. Give me the key. Give me this. Okay. I got a new command.
[2337.29s -> 2338.09s]  Close the gate.
[2345.85s -> 2352.58s]  What? You can seal the floodgate. Once your men have fixed the pulley to the gate,
[2352.58s -> 2355.22s]  order them to close the gate. The gate will fall into place.
[2355.86s -> 2361.19s]  Once the gate is closed, say flood the river to open it. Close the gate.
[2367.19s -> 2382.74s]  Fart into the mic. Oh, wow. That's fucking hilarious. Flood the river. No, it's not worth it.
[2382.74s -> 2404.18s]  It's not worth it. March left. Fall back. I gotta do some work here. I need the spool. I need the
[2404.18s -> 2413.05s]  spool. Fall back. Fall back. March right. There we go. There we go. Knock that tower down.
[2413.69s -> 2425.05s]  Fall back. I got the key. Oops. Sorry. Grab that key. Rally. All right. I got the key.
[2428.12s -> 2439.19s]  Oh, shit. The troops have taken the key. Open that door. March right. Oh, fuck. They're coming
[2439.19s -> 2455.24s]  over here. Fall back. Get it. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Put the key. March right.
[2455.96s -> 2480.42s]  March left. Flank and destroy. We need to push. Advance. Advance. Advance. Advance. Hit it.
[2481.06s -> 2492.12s]  Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy. There it is. Finally. My god. Somebody get that. Somebody pick
[2492.12s -> 2518.62s]  that shit up. Rally. This is seriously the only fucking way to do this. Can I put it in my ear?
[2519.42s -> 2539.62s]  There we go. Good. Get the key, too. Don't rally there yet. Get that fucking key.
[2541.02s -> 2552.74s]  But what a good start. Rally. Fucking noise. So the crunching sounds in that. I don't know
[2552.74s -> 2571.75s]  what it is with this shit. Tape it? I could tape it like around my neck. I'm not at that point yet.
[2575.27s -> 2710.66s]  Tape. Hold on. Gamer neck brace. Tape it to the controller. Oh, shit. I could have
[2710.90s -> 2718.63s]  taped it this way and just hold it right here. Supreme. He's the supreme commander.
[2718.63s -> 2739.98s]  Where's my? Oh, my headphones are already in. Okay. I'm ready. It's hard when I swallow my
[2739.98s -> 2758.39s]  neck pulses. Okay, let's go. Okay. Good. Good. Good start. I know. I know what the key is. I know
[2758.39s -> 2788.60s]  what the key is. Rally. Good. Give me that spool. Flank and destroy. Shit. Rally. No, no, no, no.
[2788.60s -> 2803.29s]  I forgot. We've used the key to open the gate. Rally. Oh, that was a good hit.
[2808.02s -> 2817.11s]  Don't. Watch out. Okay. The troops have taken the pulley. What's the command? What's the command?
[2819.80s -> 2828.50s]  Advance. What's the command? Move right. I don't know. It's not. It's like it's like close the
[2828.50s -> 2878.89s]  pulley or something. Close the gate. You look dumb. What's this? Wait, wait, wait.
[2878.89s -> 2887.70s]  Game. What are people linking here? Controllers. Game queue.
[2912.10s -> 2938.02s]  This is why you always check what's in what the contents of the bag are.
[2938.95s -> 3039.21s]  Always check the contents of the bag. Okay. That's very difficult, too. Oh, my God. All right.
[3039.21s -> 3060.18s]  Let's go. Get that fucking key. Rally. Rally. The audio. I know the audio is so bad.
[3060.18s -> 3075.72s]  Fall back. Fall back. I want. I need to get the spool. I need to get the spool of yarn.
[3078.23s -> 3092.02s]  Yes. Come on. Open the gate. Okay. Advance. Protect the belt. Get the. Come on.
[3092.74s -> 3101.90s]  Take the audio out of the corn flakes, please. Take the audio out of the corn flakes, please.
[3104.94s -> 3129.19s]  God damn it. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I saved it. Advance. Blank and destroy. God damn it.
[3129.83s -> 3141.29s]  There's people here. Fall back. Fall back. I'm disabled. I'm disabled. I'm disabled. I'm disabled.
[3152.71s -> 3163.19s]  I'm trying to hit the stupid fucking spool over here and I can't get it.
[3163.83s -> 3175.86s]  What just happened? Why did it fire? It prematurely fired. No, I don't. Don't grab the key.
[3178.18s -> 3185.83s]  Wine plus corn flakes zone. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Now I have to bring people. Fall back.
[3186.55s -> 3198.34s]  Rally. Fall back. Fall back. I got to select. I got to select. I got to select. I know. I know
[3198.34s -> 3212.02s]  what it does. I know what it does. You don't have to tell me. Fall back. Fall back. Fall back. Get it.
[3212.66s -> 3233.02s]  Fall back. Oh, shit. They're over there. They're past the river now. God damn it. Fall back. Fall
[3233.02s -> 3245.56s]  back. Fall back. What? All right. Roll back and kill everybody. Here it comes. All right. Okay.

[3272.34s -> 3285.64s]  Advance. There we go. Nice. The floodgates now open and I can't. It's got to hit these guys. Come on.
[3295.03s -> 3300.71s]  Fall back. Don't push forward. I don't have enough men. I got to wipe them out with this.
[3301.43s -> 3315.69s]  There it is. I'm killing my own fucking people. No, don't turn this shit on. Close the gate. Push
[3315.69s -> 3325.74s]  forward. Did that just say he hates us? Did that guy just say he hates streaming? Push forward.
[3327.29s -> 3342.41s]  Close the gate. Close the gate. Push forward. Push forward. Press forward. Press forward.

[3408.70s -> 3433.70s]  Press forward. Press what? Press what? I think this is over. Press forward. They got no morale.
[3439.13s -> 3448.50s]  Get that green ball. Press forward. This is it. Press forward. Come on. I got a green fucking ball.
[3453.11s -> 3464.76s]  Is this? What? Press forward. What the fuck is going on with the ball? Press forward.
[3470.12s -> 3478.38s]  Press forward. Shit. Dude, fuck. This is playing pinball with a bunch of people.

[3487.13s -> 3501.21s]  You're losing frames. No, I'm not falling for that again. Press forward. Are they going? I gotta,
[3501.21s -> 3518.06s]  like, close this other gate. Trying this one more fucking time. One more time. One more time.
[3518.06s -> 3535.74s]  Don't put out all your troops yet. Knock this down first. Boom. Okay. Just so it's available.
[3536.30s -> 3547.62s]  Good. Get the key too. That's both now. Hold on. Don't. Get the key. Get the key first.
[3548.34s -> 3563.99s]  Rally. What? What am I opening this door even for? What's the point of opening this door?
[3563.99s -> 3567.99s]  No, no, no. Close the gate. Close it. Oh my God. Why did that have to happen?
[3568.87s -> 3587.16s]  I've tried to aim at that fucking thing a hundred times. Rally. Give them encouragement. There is
[3587.16s -> 3598.06s]  no encouragement. The door, the key opens up. Hold on. Push forward. Press forward. We use the
[3598.06s -> 3612.54s]  key to open the gate. Flank and destroy. Flank and destroy. Did I just kill, like, how many people
[3612.54s -> 3626.39s]  did I just kill? Close the gate. Good. The curse is in the wrong place. Close the gate. Good hit.
[3628.95s -> 3640.02s]  Close the gate. Why did they, where'd they come from? They're all, wait, who did that?
[3642.04s -> 3645.64s]  Close the gate. Close the, close the gate. Close the gate. Close the gate. It closed.
[3646.74s -> 3661.74s]  It hit the gate. The gate closed. It was the other gate that was closed.
[3663.94s -> 3681.74s]  That only works on the second gate. Oh, so fuck. Fuck. Okay. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I want
[3681.74s -> 3687.40s]  to at least see the boss. I mean, I want to see the first boss. Okay. Here we go. That one's closed.
[3687.40s -> 3698.92s]  Don't hit that gate anymore. I can't even control. Rally. I can't even control where the thing goes.

[3766.86s -> 3777.91s]  confuses me. I don't even know. Thinking quickly, Jerma constructs a GameCube mode.
[3777.91s -> 3782.81s]  That's like too many replacements here. All right. Don't send any troops out until I got this fucking
[3782.81s -> 3805.67s]  clear. Fuck morale. Fall back. Fall back. Okay. I'm in danger. Press forward. Stop them. Press

[4049.14s -> 4079.35s]  Close the gate. They, they're fucked up. They won't put it on the fucking door. I'm ready to go.
[4081.24s -> 4119.26s]  Close the gate. Oh my god. You fucking. Oh. Rally. Why wouldn't they put the thing on the,
[4119.26s -> 4128.55s]  on the gate? I have to fucking do this one more time. I gotta fucking play.

[4499.96s -> 4517.82s]  I came so close last time. All right, let's go. That's a gambler mentality. No, it's not.
[4519.74s -> 4529.99s]  No, it's not. This is not a gambler's fallacy. I paid like $12 for this game. I don't have to
[4529.99s -> 4537.86s]  gamble anymore money. Why are you moving forward? What the fuck are you doing? Just, oh my god.

[4813.69s -> 4829.83s]  these rice balls. Use the, how? Command scroll? Close the gate. Rally. Fall back. But there's no
[4829.83s -> 4851.45s]  like, there's no like eat food command. Okay. I press A. Where's my cursor? Dude, where's the,

[5220.89s -> 5230.66s]  boss fight. This is the only reason why I care. Dude, I did two or three straight up, straight down.
[5230.66s -> 5242.25s]  That guy's huge. The final battle of the Kuruwau Plains. That menacing figure is General Kawai
[5243.21s -> 5252.09s]  Apechia. I could have hit him with the ball, don't I?
[5252.09s -> 5265.13s]  Wait, it's flipper versus flipper?
[5272.12s -> 5277.08s]  So he's playing pinball too. Rally troops had a flipper to seize it.

[5844.41s -> 5868.07s]  forward. I'm not fucking tilting either. Look, the reason why I'm not tilting is because every
[5868.07s -> 5872.95s]  single time, every video game you've ever played, every establishment you've ever been to,
[5872.95s -> 5880.65s]  if you tilt, the game goes, don't fucking do that, and you get in trouble. It's burning my brain.

[6090.38s -> 6102.39s]  Do it! What the fuck just happened? It bounced over the... All right, you hit it too hard. That's
[6102.39s -> 6105.83s]  like when you're playing air hockey with all your friends and they hit it too hard and it's like,
[6105.83s -> 6117.29s]  dude, it's like... It like bounces and goes that way. Like fucking relax. That was so good too.
[6118.01s -> 6124.74s]  Never pressed forward. Doesn't matter. The ball came back to hit me in the fucking... What's going on?
[6127.86s -> 6133.11s]  That's the problem. It was too far away. Why am I addicted to this fucking stupid ass game?

[6232.17s -> 6244.06s]  to go in the corner. Fuck that. We're going to go into the corner. Stay back. I want to select the

[6485.19s -> 6492.84s]  Fuck you, man. God. What? This was magnetized to my character? That's just don't worry. It's
[6492.84s -> 6497.69s]  just the Wii sensor bar. It was just the Wii sensor bar. Wasn't anything expensive.
[6498.33s -> 6513.30s]  You can have two goddamn candles and it'll work. I want to watch this video. I want to watch this
[6513.30s -> 6528.52s]  video. Where is it? Somebody actually made it. Good. I can't wait to watch this. Hold on. Let me

[6619.02s -> 6632.12s]  that? Wait, but hold on a second. Why did you? It was just supposed to be the e-cigar. Why did
[6632.12s -> 6649.43s]  you make it an actual vape pen? It comes up for so long. And then, look, it trails off and it happens
[6649.43s -> 6667.59s]  again. It's perfect. And all y'all were saying, why is he doing this? Come on, man. Minus two.

[6695.50s -> 6711.69s]  another one. This one's much longer than that one. Can somebody please give me an edit? Somebody,

[6780.98s -> 6785.70s]  that's it. There's a better one. Stop blinking the fucking uh-oh stinky video, okay? I'm not
[6785.70s -> 6797.54s]  gonna watch it. All right, that was fun. Let's go back to what we were doing. Me desperately trying
[6797.54s -> 6809.78s]  to beat this microphone video game from 20 years ago. 50,000 channel points for a train whistle.
[6809.78s -> 6821.91s]  That's not happening. Back to losing at pinball on purpose. It's fucking exhausting.
[6829.18s -> 6850.06s]  Press forward. Oh god. All right, give me something. Press forward. Damn, this morale is so bad. I'm
[6850.06s -> 6859.27s]  not gonna bring any troops out until it's confirmed that everything's safe. It's that hard.

[7088.87s -> 7095.11s]  You gotta get it up there and fucking smash the fuck out of him before you even send anybody.
[7097.02s -> 7108.74s]  He looks like he's riding a horse. The audio is desynced. It shouldn't be. Hold on. We're gonna
[7108.74s -> 7143.78s]  test this sometime. One. Two. Three. Hold on. It's a little off. I'm like a couple of- I'm like 100

[8555.70s -> 8595.18s]  tries. I'm breaking the disc on camera. If I don't do it. Press forward. Press forward. Rally. Give

[10471.37s -> 10502.02s]  didn't it? You messed up the whole thing, son. This is insanity. Imagine getting this for
[10502.02s -> 10507.54s]  Christmas and crying because you can't beat this. Imagine how bad your mother or father would
[10507.54s -> 10515.83s]  felt watching your fucking son or daughter sit here and cry playing this level to be like,

[10596.15s -> 10600.07s]  it's over and it's not over. That's what you got to do. That's what you got to do. And then
[10600.07s -> 10635.22s]  the game has to like have a great... Don't even talk shit. Just play. Fall back. Push forward.
[10635.22s -> 10645.67s]  Rally. Troops die soon as they come out. Yeah. And unfortunately for me, I don't get to have an
[10645.67s -> 10653.19s]  infinite supply like this motherfucker does. See, this dickhead can just spawn as many people as
[10653.19s -> 10657.67s]  he wants for the entire duration of this whole fight. I get like a hundred people and then maybe
[10657.67s -> 10665.75s]  a green fruit snack ball that I can steal some of his guys. This is infinite fucking dog shit.
[10686.68s -> 10710.23s]  No, it's not. One more after this. Press forward. Press forward. Rally. Why did I lose the green
[10710.23s -> 10745.96s]  immediately? Rally. Rally. Rally. Fall back. Rally. Why does it take them so long? It takes them one
[10745.96s -> 10749.48s]  second to capture the left one. Why does it take so long to capture the right one?
[10750.81s -> 10811.99s]  Oh. Rally. Oh, you did it. You finally did it. Fall back. Rally. Press forward. How did you sneak
[10811.99s -> 10855.67s]  by there, motherfucker? What just happened? We don't have any more fucking morale. TikTok.
[10856.63s -> 10865.19s]  TikTok. There's no more men. There's no more men on my team. Give me the green ball. Give me the
[10865.19s -> 10891.03s]  green ball and all things are fine. Push forward. Push forward. Push forward. This is actually the
[10891.03s -> 10898.23s]  last time I'm going to do this before I'm going to put this fucking disk in like and put like a
[10898.23s -> 10906.10s]  random address and fucking like and like Antarctica and ship it there. I'm going to like middle of the
[10906.10s -> 10943.94s]  fucking ocean in Antarctica or something. Get this away from my house. That was fucking such bullshit.
[10943.94s -> 10957.37s]  That wasn't even fair. That was not even. That was not even. Shit. That's so unfair.
[10957.93s -> 10963.75s]  That doesn't count. That doesn't count. That doesn't. That can't count.
[10964.79s -> 11033.37s]  Push forward. Press forward. Dude, the ball. What the fuck are you doing, mate? Rally. Rally.
[11033.37s -> 11054.44s]  Everybody's dead. I gotta get it up there. In there. He's addicted. I'm addicted. I'm addicted
[11054.44s -> 11083.98s]  to not. I'm addicted to beating this one boss. Fucking audio is killing my brain. Rally. All
[11083.98s -> 11088.76s]  right. I need green now. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green.
[11088.76s -> 11103.53s]  Give me the green thing. It's not green. Fall back. Fall back. That's what I want. Did his wall just
[11103.53s -> 11139.75s]  respawn? Why did this motherfucker's wall just respawn? Fall back. Rally. Press forward. Press
[11139.75s -> 11161.02s]  forward. Get that fucking green. This is it. Why did it take it off, bro? Press forward. Press
[11161.02s -> 11213.94s]  forward. Press forward. I was trying to roll it over to the fucking stupid time. Rally. Press forward.
[11213.94s -> 11253.21s]  Rally. Rally. Three hours of crackling audio. Rally. Rally. I know. There's like explosions
[11253.21s -> 11265.80s]  in my fucking ear. I know. There's nothing left. It's just a bell guy. I took the disc out and I
[11265.80s -> 11290.79s]  can't even stop. I took the fucking CD out and I can't even stop playing. This game looks a little
[11290.79s -> 11300.84s]  frustrating with a happy face. What if you beat it with the disc? This cover is open. If you want
[11300.84s -> 11320.10s]  to continue, close the disc cover. No, I don't think I do. Remind me to never play that game
[11320.10s -> 11331.64s]  ever again. Remind me to fucking shred the disc before this stream turns off. It's fun. It's fun.
