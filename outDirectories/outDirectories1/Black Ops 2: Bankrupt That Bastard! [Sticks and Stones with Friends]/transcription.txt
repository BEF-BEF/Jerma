[0.31s -> 10.50s]  Are you sure you don't want to join Berg?
[10.50s -> 15.96s]  Wait, what are we offering? What is my deal?
[15.96s -> 19.96s]  For every video that you upload with the clan tag Berg,
[19.96s -> 24.96s]  the Berg CEO of Berg Industries gives you $5,000.
[24.96s -> 28.34s]  $5,000?
[28.34s -> 31.34s]  Now, we're talking about the CEO of Berg Associates.
[31.34s -> 35.34s]  This is one of the biggest corporations in the world.
[35.34s -> 38.34s]  Yeah, I can clearly tell that this is serious stuff.
[38.34s -> 39.34s]  But...
[39.34s -> 42.34s]  But you have to give me time. I have to talk this over with my agent.
[42.34s -> 45.34s]  Well, in each upload, I forgot to mention this is part of the stipulation,
[45.34s -> 48.34s]  in each upload you have to be completely naked.
[48.34s -> 50.34s]  And there has to be a face cam on you.
[50.34s -> 52.34s]  Like on your naked butt.
[52.34s -> 54.28s]  I'm totally fine with that.
[54.28s -> 57.48s]  Even if it got flagged and you got removed?
[57.48s -> 61.48s]  No, but I mean, can I do the uploads on livejasmine.com? Is that okay?
[61.48s -> 66.54s]  No, it has to be on YouTube.
[66.54s -> 68.54s]  And you can make like separate accounts.
[68.54s -> 70.54s]  Yeah, I guess I'll have to do that.
[70.54s -> 73.78s]  Dude, you'd get arrested.
[73.78s -> 76.34s]  Somebody actually has.
[76.34s -> 77.34s]  No, already.
[77.34s -> 81.34s]  Somebody actually has the McDonald's logo.
[81.34s -> 83.34s]  I don't find that hilarious.
[83.34s -> 85.34s]  No!
[85.34s -> 87.34s]  It's been too long since I've played this game.
[87.34s -> 90.34s]  He is going big. Going ham.
[90.34s -> 92.58s]  I'm in the middle, guys.
[92.58s -> 94.58s]  I keep forgetting that left click is not like melee.
[94.58s -> 98.58s]  I keep trying to left click and I throw a friggin' blade at the wall.
[98.58s -> 101.65s]  How does that make you feel?
[101.65s -> 103.65s]  You're getting excited now, but you're going to...
[103.65s -> 105.65s]  I am getting very excited.
[105.65s -> 107.65s]  Oh, I missed him!
[107.65s -> 109.65s]  Oh, you didn't even throw it.
[109.65s -> 111.65s]  On my screen I did.
[111.65s -> 113.65s]  No, not on my screen.
[113.65s -> 115.65s]  I was holding it for really long.
[115.65s -> 117.65s]  Sweden ping, bro.
[117.65s -> 120.65s]  Okay, so now the ping game starts.
[120.65s -> 123.65s]  Yeah, it's like, dude, come on. My ping sucks, dude.
[123.65s -> 125.65s]  My controller's broken.
[125.65s -> 127.65s]  Totally, dude.
[127.65s -> 129.65s]  My A button on my controller doesn't work.
[129.65s -> 131.95s]  Like, I don't know.
[131.95s -> 133.95s]  My controller's like broken.
[133.95s -> 136.95s]  That's the oldest excuse in the book.
[136.95s -> 141.41s]  You actually invented that excuse.
[141.41s -> 143.41s]  Back in the day.
[143.41s -> 145.41s]  Oh, hey, dude.
[145.41s -> 147.41s]  Oh, I thought you backed me.
[147.41s -> 149.41s]  I thought you backed me first.
[149.41s -> 151.41s]  You're shit.
[151.41s -> 156.84s]  It's so back, too, because I'm doing the climb maneuver.
[156.84s -> 158.84s]  So I can't do anything.
[158.84s -> 161.85s]  Okay, meet me, listen.
[161.85s -> 164.85s]  Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock, okay?
[164.85s -> 166.85s]  I don't know where the statue is that will play this game.
[166.85s -> 168.85s]  Oh, wait, I'm going to bank.
[168.85s -> 170.85s]  What was that? You were going to bank what?
[170.85s -> 172.85s]  What were you going to do? You were going to bank me?
[172.85s -> 174.85s]  Okay, I'm coming for you.
[174.85s -> 176.85s]  Oh, there we go.
[176.85s -> 179.79s]  Okay, now meet me at the statue.
[179.79s -> 181.79s]  Meet me at the statue.
[181.79s -> 183.79s]  I'm at the statue.
[183.79s -> 185.79s]  You said meet me at the statue.
[185.79s -> 187.79s]  You didn't say I'm going to kill you at the statue.
[187.79s -> 189.79s]  I'm like, just stand here.
[189.79s -> 191.79s]  Okay, I'm on the statue.
[191.79s -> 193.79s]  That means we're going to hang out,
[193.79s -> 197.38s]  not you're going to throw a knife at my head.
[197.38s -> 199.38s]  All right, where are you?
[199.38s -> 201.38s]  Look at that kill cam.
[201.38s -> 203.81s]  What did I just do to you?
[203.81s -> 205.81s]  I came to the statue.
[205.81s -> 207.81s]  I'm still trying to be your friend.
[207.81s -> 210.43s]  What are you doing?
[210.43s -> 212.43s]  You're the best opponent ever.
[212.43s -> 215.43s]  Now you see, when you break the friendship trust,
[215.43s -> 217.43s]  meet at the statue queue,
[217.43s -> 219.43s]  now you're getting bankrupted.
[219.43s -> 221.43s]  It's going to happen in this game.
[221.43s -> 223.43s]  I thought we were going to be weird.
[223.43s -> 225.43s]  All right, you know what?
[225.43s -> 229.08s]  Watch this.
[229.08s -> 231.08s]  Is there another guy right here?
[231.08s -> 233.08s]  Oh, it's you.
[233.08s -> 235.08s]  Oh, you slag.
[235.08s -> 237.08s]  Somebody was behind you too.
[237.08s -> 239.08s]  All right, boo, we're going to have to kill him.
[239.08s -> 241.77s]  Well, once again, Orb is going to lead here
[241.77s -> 245.77s]  with quite a solid 125 points.
[245.77s -> 247.77s]  It looks like another victory here for Orb.
[247.77s -> 250.77s]  He is going to try and not really play it cool
[250.77s -> 252.77s]  because he doesn't really...
[252.77s -> 255.77s]  Oh, only Orb will shell cast his own live gameplay
[255.77s -> 257.77s]  about how good he is.
[257.77s -> 259.77s]  Oh, shit, very shortly.
[259.77s -> 261.77s]  Boo, are you ready for this one?
[261.77s -> 263.77s]  Oh, that wasn't even him.
[263.77s -> 265.77s]  Now I'm ready.
[265.77s -> 267.77s]  I'm going to slap you with my axe.
[267.77s -> 269.77s]  No, I'm sorry, boo.
[269.77s -> 271.77s]  What?
[271.77s -> 273.77s]  I thought it was him.
[273.77s -> 275.77s]  Okay, come to the statue now.
[275.77s -> 277.77s]  It's not.
[277.77s -> 279.77s]  Hey, boo, don't shoot me.
[279.77s -> 282.90s]  Don't shoot me, I didn't mean to.
[282.90s -> 284.90s]  Come here, guys.
[284.90s -> 287.14s]  I'm by the statue, guys. Where are you guys?
[287.14s -> 289.14s]  Me and boo have a mission right now
[289.14s -> 291.14s]  to come destroy you.
[291.14s -> 293.14s]  You're really pre-aiming me?
[293.14s -> 295.14s]  Really?
[295.14s -> 297.14s]  Okay, I see how it is.
[297.14s -> 299.14s]  I see how we're going to play this.
[299.14s -> 302.33s]  Oh, shit.
[302.33s -> 304.33s]  No, no, no.
[304.33s -> 306.33s]  I don't have anything. Where is he?
[306.33s -> 309.19s]  No, no.
[309.19s -> 311.19s]  Behind you, what are you doing?
[311.19s -> 313.19s]  I don't know where he is.
[313.19s -> 315.19s]  I was behind you for the longest time.
[315.19s -> 317.19s]  I missed everything.
[317.19s -> 319.19s]  Hey, well, that shows.
[319.19s -> 321.19s]  Well, 145 points, guys.
[321.19s -> 323.19s]  I'm going to put this hatchet up your asshole.
[323.19s -> 325.19s]  I believe we have another W
[325.19s -> 327.19s]  in the vicinity of this game.
[327.19s -> 329.19s]  Jerma, we got 40 seconds.
[329.19s -> 331.19s]  Please make him count.
[331.19s -> 333.19s]  I'm not even throwing, I'm trying to find him.
[333.19s -> 335.19s]  Okay, so we've come to that part of the game again
[335.19s -> 337.19s]  where I like to talk.
[337.19s -> 339.19s]  Where is he?
[339.19s -> 341.19s]  145 points on the scoreboard here
[341.19s -> 343.19s]  and we're going to play another victory here
[343.19s -> 345.19s]  for Orb. He's been playing consistently
[345.19s -> 347.19s]  throughout this tournament
[347.19s -> 349.19s]  and he is going to
[349.19s -> 351.19s]  you know, not really try
[351.19s -> 353.19s]  because it's already 10 seconds.
[353.19s -> 355.19s]  It's got to be a victory here.
[355.19s -> 357.19s]  He's going to walk around and try to
[357.19s -> 359.19s]  let the opponent back him here.
[359.19s -> 361.19s]  No, my Jesus!
[361.19s -> 363.19s]  Oh, yes, you got him.
[363.19s -> 365.19s]  What an evil guy.
[365.19s -> 367.19s]  Listen, I don't believe
[367.19s -> 369.19s]  it lagged.
[369.19s -> 371.19s]  Oh, yeah.
[371.19s -> 373.19s]  Dude, I played like shit in this game
[373.19s -> 375.19s]  and I got second place.
[375.19s -> 377.19s]  Nice host.
[377.19s -> 379.19s]  I lag, guys.
[379.19s -> 381.19s]  I got banged right here.
[381.19s -> 383.19s]  Are you going to DDoS
[383.19s -> 385.19s]  me right now, guys?
[385.19s -> 387.19s]  Are you that amped to win?
[387.19s -> 389.19s]  Are you going to DDoS me?
[389.19s -> 391.19s]  See you guys.
[391.19s -> 393.19s]  I think I went right at the end and then I got
[393.19s -> 395.19s]  bankrupt with one second left.
[395.19s -> 397.19s]  Jerma, what happened to Orb?
[397.19s -> 399.19s]  Don't you remember all the times we met
[399.19s -> 401.19s]  at the statue?
[401.19s -> 403.19s]  Yeah, I remember meet me at the statue so I can punch you in the face.
[403.19s -> 405.19s]  That's like what happened.
[405.19s -> 407.19s]  Meet me at the flagpole after school.
[407.19s -> 409.19s]  I'm going to put like an icicle up your ass.
