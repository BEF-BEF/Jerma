[10.30s -> 20.71s]  Hello, my constituents. Welcome to Favour the King. It is I,
[21.35s -> 32.23s]  Gerber985, your king, your ruler. And I just have one thing to say, bonjour. Can we get a
[32.23s -> 45.56s]  bunch of bonjours in the chat, please? Look at the fireworks. What a glorious day it is for
[45.56s -> 51.22s]  favouring your king. Those of you that don't know how this is going to work,
[51.94s -> 59.11s]  uh, this one's actually gonna work. Last time we did this, it was a little bit of a problem.
[59.11s -> 69.42s]  This server is fucking clean. Yes, it's not, it is not the other one. It is not the F word.
[69.42s -> 79.75s]  Somebody just threw me an emerald. People throwing me jewels? I don't want to get rid of this.
[79.75s -> 83.19s]  Of course you would send jewels to your king. What am I speaking of?
[83.19s -> 97.61s]  What are you getting? The snowballs. There's no snow on this map. How many people are in here?
[97.61s -> 105.46s]  10,000? Is it 8,000 people in this game right now? Something like that. But we have some events to
[105.46s -> 110.10s]  do. We have a lot of things to do today. I ain't just going to run around and let you shoot me
[110.10s -> 119.22s]  with arrows. Not like last time. Wait, there is snow. Oh, there is. Yeah, there is. There's snow
[119.22s -> 125.30s]  here. You're right. Like that. I don't know. That's not enough snow to make snowballs.
[125.30s -> 131.05s]  There's 10,000 people here. There's not enough 10,000. There's not 10,000 people worth of
[131.05s -> 137.16s]  snowballs over there. Anyways, the first thing we're going to do is it's going to be a fucking
[137.16s -> 143.10s]  shit show. You can guarantee yourself that. By the way, welcome to Minecon, right? It's Minecraft
[143.10s -> 151.14s]  Day. Didn't mean to do that at all, actually. That was just an actual coincidence. I had no
[151.14s -> 156.31s]  fucking idea that today was like Minecraft Day. Remember, we were supposed to do this like two,
[156.31s -> 181.67s]  three weeks ago. This got... Is that your dog? Otto? He was like, let me in. All right, the first
[181.67s -> 189.46s]  thing we're going to do, we're going to kick this off. This is going to be a mess. The first thing
[189.54s -> 196.42s]  that I need to tell you is if you get in this game, you have 10 lives. Once you die 10 times,
[196.42s -> 202.94s]  you're out and you have to re-queue. So try not to die. It's going to be kind of hard.
[202.94s -> 209.54s]  During the course of the next few hours, you're going to see plenty of death. Not from each other
[209.54s -> 220.66s]  either. We'll see. It's a lag. Here comes the lag for so many people in the same spot. Holy shit.
[220.66s -> 238.02s]  It's handling it though. It's actually handling it. Everybody said, nice stream, idiot. It's client
[238.02s -> 242.50s]  lag. It's because the game was never supposed to allow you to have 5 million people in the same
[242.50s -> 253.72s]  spot. But anyway, nice fucking stream. Honk, honk. All right. Anyways, the first thing we're going to
[253.72s -> 257.96s]  do, let's get the first thing started. Everybody in the server... By the way, if you want to play,
[257.96s -> 266.65s]  it's Jermaf.tk in the Minecraft client. You got to have Java. Java client, not the Windows client,
[266.65s -> 278.55s]  not the Switch client. Got to be the Java client. And once you do that, you'll be put into a queue.
[278.55s -> 283.11s]  When somebody dies in this server in this game, they'll be knocked out. You'll take their place.
[283.11s -> 292.18s]  So let's get started. You get 10 lives. I wish you all well. The first thing we're going to do
[292.18s -> 306.95s]  is build. What the fuck was that? I didn't do that. I didn't do that. I mean, I can do that.
[306.95s -> 320.02s]  I have this thing. I'm going to get a good look at this. What version? 1.8.8 through 1.16. You
[320.02s -> 333.82s]  can join any of those. Who's driving the ice cream truck in the background? I can do that.
[333.82s -> 342.26s]  Can I? I think my stick of lightning is broken. I can no longer cast lightning. Lightning just
[342.26s -> 351.26s]  strikes randomly in the fucking server. All right. So the first thing we're going to do,
[351.26s -> 354.14s]  we're going to build. Everyone's going to get blocks in their inventory.
[354.14s -> 358.63s]  You're only going to get 10 blocks. You all have to make a statue of your king.
[358.63s -> 367.62s]  If you place a block, it's there forever. You cannot have them be destroyed. They cannot be
[367.62s -> 371.43s]  picked back up. You want to build me a statue. Forget about the lightning.
[371.43s -> 382.01s]  Why is it the flag of Italy? That's like the Aquafresh logo. What are you talking about?
[382.01s -> 390.47s]  Italy. All right. Are we ready? Are we ready to start? Are we confirmed that we're ready to
[390.47s -> 394.55s]  begin the build process where you have to build me a statue? Work together.
[394.55s -> 415.35s]  Please, your king. Please. For the love of God. Minecraft sucks. Don't say that on Minecraft day.
[415.35s -> 437.27s]  You guys ready? I'm going to fly away for a second. Here comes the build. Here's the thing.
[437.27s -> 443.10s]  If you guys make anything that's phallic shaped, it's getting deleted. I'll just delete it. I'll
[443.10s -> 451.48s]  just delete it. Are you supposed to build with all the client lag? I don't know. Good luck.
[451.48s -> 465.91s]  Why is this pre-recorded? It's not. I'm right here, dude. It looks like mafia graphics.
[465.91s -> 471.80s]  Yeah. From my perspective, it's going to be lagging, but not from other perspectives. Don't
[471.80s -> 478.20s]  worry. This is like 10 FPS. Yeah, it is because we're capturing it through something else. But
[478.20s -> 484.41s]  my perspective doesn't matter. We're going to switch. Don't worry. Don't worry. Am I hosting
[484.41s -> 509.45s]  the server? No. Wait, what? I am not hosting the server. Am I like garage? Everything is lagging.
[509.45s -> 525.90s]  Well, don't worry. Once we do the actual events and we let the server rest, it's going to be fine.
[525.90s -> 531.26s]  Did I get a better computer? Oh, this is running over the course of,
[531.26s -> 536.36s]  I think there's like 10 servers. I think there's like 15 servers this is running on right now.
[536.36s -> 551.93s]  Grab a Scott burger? Yes. I haven't had it yet, but what is it? Lettuce, tomato,
[551.93s -> 556.26s]  ketchup, mustard, mushrooms, onions, ketchup, mustard, and bacon. Something like that.
[559.26s -> 575.85s]  I see a five. My five is not the problem. It's running at two frames per second. Oh, that's
[575.85s -> 590.22s]  weird. All right. We have a solution. We have a solution. Hey, look at me. Welcome to technical
[590.22s -> 598.06s]  difficulties. We're going to, we have to restart the server and it'll be fixed when we restart it.
[598.06s -> 605.00s]  We have to cut the player count by like a hundred people. All right, let's go. Turn it off. Put us
[605.00s -> 609.40s]  on the BRB screen. We'll be right back. Hey, last time we started the stream two hours late,
[609.40s -> 613.72s]  I was here on time at 301 with technical difficulties. Just cut it. We'll be back in
[613.72s -> 619.61s]  10 seconds. I was two and a half hours late last FTK. It's only been 15 minutes. Everybody
[619.61s -> 933.05s]  chill in your seats and relax. We'll be back in 10 minutes. Hey dude, is it your VPN? No,
[933.05s -> 942.74s]  no, that was a joke. Hi. Hi everybody. Hey, how's everybody doing? It's me, laggy. Somebody said,
[942.74s -> 949.61s]  and I will give you this. I'll give you credit. Somebody said, bod watchers skip 30 minutes. Yeah.
[949.61s -> 959.98s]  All right. You sure you get it. You get that one. I hadn't even been 30 minutes yet though.
[959.98s -> 970.57s]  Okay. So I think we are ready to start. Keep in mind the first person view for me or inventory
[970.57s -> 979.43s]  purposes is going to be, it's a lower frame rate. Everything else should not be. Yes. You know what?
[979.43s -> 983.59s]  Just skip 10 minutes. If you get involved right now, just go 10 minutes from now. You'll look,
[983.59s -> 988.07s]  you'll see it. You'll be happy. You should have listened to that one guy like 25 minutes ago. He
[988.07s -> 996.34s]  was right. All right. Everybody's going to get blocks placed in their inventory and you are going
[996.34s -> 1003.53s]  to be looking at it. It says, look at how clean this is. You're in a windows destruction. Everybody
[1003.53s -> 1009.75s]  has blocks in the inventory. I want a statue. I want a statue built of me. Place those blocks.
[1009.75s -> 1019.27s]  They do not come up when you place them. So don't fuck it up. Here. Look, I'll get you started.
[1019.27s -> 1022.87s]  Oh shit. I can't. Can I put, can I pick that back up? Look, I'll start it.
[1026.36s -> 1036.97s]  Watch out for the flowers. They can't be, the flowers can't be removed. All right. Go. You only
[1036.97s -> 1070.46s]  get 10. Why would you go straight up, dude? The stream is in 1080p. Nice 2008 YouTube video.
[1075.22s -> 1098.22s]  This just looks like a level in like Super Mario sunshine. This is not a statue. This is,
[1098.22s -> 1118.79s]  why does this guy have dirt? Unregistered hyper cam. This is not a statue. You guys got it all
[1118.79s -> 1125.77s]  wrong. What? Whoa. That's actually pretty sick. Wow. That's actually kind of good.
[1126.41s -> 1145.29s]  Uh, this is supposed to be a statue of me, not what it feels like to step on a Lego
[1148.58s -> 1154.02s]  water. I just spit, I spit fucking water everywhere right there. I spit out so much.
[1161.46s -> 1173.13s]  You're a pause to buffer. What? What do you mean pause? How's that? Is that, is that better? Oh
[1173.13s -> 1184.09s]  shit. Be careful. You can die. You can die. You can die. I can hear the CPU fans from here.
[1201.78s -> 1205.38s]  Yeah. It's all what you're seeing is, is what happens when hundreds of people are in the same
[1205.38s -> 1210.17s]  spot. It's all client side lag that it will even out once we do the next couple of events. Don't
[1210.17s -> 1226.94s]  worry. Such dog shit. People are just writing fuck. I don't know. Let me, let me, let me,
[1226.94s -> 1232.12s]  I gotta be honest with you. I don't know why I want so badly to be have like a collaborative
[1232.12s -> 1238.70s]  statue build. This is the kind of shit that those little weird guys used to make in Fraggle Rock.
[1240.34s -> 1245.46s]  This is not even like a statue. Oh, I want to build a statue. That's never going to fucking
[1245.46s -> 1257.48s]  happen with like hundreds of people in the same place ever. This is absolutely dream fixed.
[1257.48s -> 1270.90s]  Oh, we got a POG moment here. It's fixed. Look at that. All right. Keep going.
[1270.90s -> 1279.43s]  Everybody said, Hey, dog shit stream. Hey, whatever. What would it say? We're good. We're
[1279.43s -> 1287.83s]  good. We're good. Look at this. We're good. Hey, I told you it was going to take 30 minutes. I told
[1287.83s -> 1293.45s]  you everybody, everybody. Why is somebody started fire? This is not going to work. The build section
[1293.45s -> 1296.87s]  is going to be stupid. Like it was always going to be stupid. Somebody started. I'm just trying
[1296.87s -> 1304.89s]  to burn it down now. Wait, actually are you making arms? Oh shit. You actually are making arms.
[1304.89s -> 1324.82s]  How do we stop them? Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I did. It's burning.
[1330.25s -> 1334.17s]  I don't know. Okay. In my dreams last night, I was lying there going like, oh man, they're
[1334.17s -> 1338.57s]  going to build when people work together, like Twitch plays Pokemon, Twitch plays the carnival
[1339.13s -> 1344.39s]  make a statue. Yeah. And I could see the arms being built in the head and the face.
[1344.39s -> 1355.40s]  They're probably going to do like a funny like face. No, this is just a series of lines up and
[1355.40s -> 1364.82s]  down and I keep striking it with lightning. That's too wishful thinking. Yeah. Expectation versus
[1364.82s -> 1381.43s]  reality. Like you, I'm going to, I'm going to cut, I'm going to call this in about two minutes.
[1381.51s -> 1391.08s]  I'm going to move on to event number two out of like 30. Oh, I got to change. How do I turn
[1391.08s -> 1401.82s]  clouds off? All right. Clouds off. All right. So let me get a good view of this. Nice. Yeah,
[1401.82s -> 1411.53s]  just good. Very good. It's just that this is not what I thought. Well, this is not what I saw in
[1411.53s -> 1420.87s]  my dream. Can somebody please build like, hold on. We, somebody's got, we got something going on up
[1420.87s -> 1439.56s]  here. Good statue of just cobblestone. This is, this is a randomly generated structure.
[1439.56s -> 1447.00s]  Like Google AI from 1998 made this and it was astonishing back in the late 90s. Like,
[1447.00s -> 1458.06s]  holy shit. Did you see what Google AI 2000 just did? I want everyone to be very aware of something.
[1458.06s -> 1466.18s]  This is the warmup. This is the warmup. The first two little events here are a very small warmup
[1466.18s -> 1470.94s]  just to get the server running and everything's gone. You ain't seen nothing yet. Don't be
[1470.94s -> 1477.22s]  fucking worried. Yeah. All right. I think, I think it's time to call the statue here. I mean,
[1477.22s -> 1484.39s]  this is, this look, this is terrible. Don't you feel like you're going to drop a coin in
[1484.39s -> 1489.35s]  the top of this thing and it's going to be a cool display to see where it goes. And then you get the
[1489.35s -> 1501.56s]  gumball at the end. I mean, that's kind of cool. I guess I don't know what people are getting lava.
[1501.56s -> 1508.07s]  Where are people getting lava and water? How does somebody already have lava? Server's been
[1508.07s -> 1516.49s]  off for like five seconds. Wait, somebody wrote the word ass when he said cock. All right. I have
[1516.49s -> 1528.41s]  to turn off the chat for me. I got to turn that off. Where does it turn it off? It's just a bucket.
[1528.41s -> 1533.34s]  All right. What's, what does it say? This is on fire. This is pretty cool. Not a statue,
[1533.34s -> 1541.35s]  but it's just pain. Okay. I see. So far so good. Dude, you're standing in there.
[1544.20s -> 1546.44s]  I even hurt people with my stick of absolute lightning.
[1550.28s -> 1555.51s]  All right. That's pretty good. You guys want to move on to the second, second event.
[1555.51s -> 1569.38s]  You've made it a great, a great thing here. Oh, it's done. It's done. It's over. It's done.
[1569.38s -> 1583.16s]  This statue is done. Otto smile. I guess the kind of is like a face down here. It's one of those
[1583.16s -> 1593.30s]  like Mario mushrooms up there. All right. I would like everybody to follow me. Thank you
[1593.30s -> 1597.62s]  for participating in the build event. Why do I think I could go through the fucking front door?
[1597.62s -> 1604.92s]  Thanks for participating in the build event, everybody. That was really fun. We're going to
[1604.92s -> 1612.60s]  move on now to the second event here, which is going to be a POG event. You can follow me,
[1612.60s -> 1616.15s]  everybody. Everyone in the server, please. We're going to go over to the Coliseum and we're going
[1616.15s -> 1624.02s]  to start the tournament. It's going to be a tournament between people in here heading over
[1624.02s -> 1636.04s]  to the Coliseum. It's a POGChamp event. You're free to say POGChamp if you want to. Follow me
[1636.04s -> 1644.78s]  to the Coliseum. Otto, you want to go inside? He's like, let me in, let me out, let me in,
[1644.78s -> 1654.92s]  let me out. Take a look at this. Who are going to enter one at a time, you will fight to the death.
[1654.92s -> 1664.71s]  Those of you that remain will be tiered based on how many people you've killed. And don't even
[1664.71s -> 1672.55s]  try to go down here because you can't. You can. You can't. You cannot. There you go. Don't even
[1672.55s -> 1680.86s]  try. You can't. I really wonder how this is going to play out. I don't think this is going to play
[1681.42s -> 1687.93s]  the way that we think it is. So two enter. Wait, people can just jump up? You can't go in though.
[1687.93s -> 1699.45s]  Good luck. It's just a glass ceiling. No, the tournament's not just everybody go in here and
[1699.45s -> 1705.46s]  just start killing each other. That's not the tournament. He's training. Wait, somebody's dead.
[1706.18s -> 1722.54s]  Wait, what? No, it's the tournament. Don't kill each other. Why are people on fire? This is the
[1722.54s -> 1727.42s]  tournament. If you die 10 times, by the way, you're fucking out of here. I need to make that very
[1727.42s -> 1736.66s]  clear. If you type slash duel, you are going to be queued up to be participating down there. It looks
[1736.66s -> 1747.14s]  like we got somebody already there. Who's there? I can't even see their name. I'm going to queue up
[1747.14s -> 1758.47s]  and fight this guy. Is he fighting anybody? Is somebody else even down there? Dick Daschle
[1758.47s -> 1768.58s]  Richard versus who? Wait, why are we all flying blocks? Who is he fighting? There's no one. Oh,
[1768.58s -> 1773.13s]  wait, here we go. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Let's go. Come on. Dick Daschle Richard
[1773.13s -> 1788.50s]  versus 847. I don't know. That's not what the fuck that number is. Are they fighting? All right.
[1788.50s -> 1794.26s]  You guys got to fight. Fight to the death. Let's go. I guess what if they just don't fight?
[1797.05s -> 1807.96s]  This guy has a sword. Well, why did you queue up for the duel if you didn't have anything to
[1807.96s -> 1817.99s]  fight with? I think he's going to win. Does this guy have armor too? Why does this guy have armor?
[1817.99s -> 1833.83s]  Who's he fighting at? Why is he swinging at us? He thought he was going to be supplied. Oh,
[1833.83s -> 1839.85s]  wait, there's people spawning. Where did this guy come from? Can't join. Can't join. Well,
[1839.85s -> 1851.91s]  the server's probably full right now. No one can connect to the server. It's probably because
[1852.31s -> 1865.37s]  it's full, right? Why are we all ghosts? Wait, hold on. Peter Griffin just saved the stream
[1865.37s -> 1882.12s]  because he showed up. People being kicked? Why are we all like floating around as ghosts? Hold
[1882.12s -> 1901.82s]  on. I'll tell him I should go outside. One sec. Come here. No, wait, the server's down.
[1901.82s -> 1919.59s]  Connection lost. Oh shit. The whole thing is down. Wait, is it actual next duel? This is the most
[1919.59s -> 1931.70s]  interesting thing I've ever seen. Why is everybody's heads just floating around as ghosts? I don't
[1931.70s -> 1958.89s]  remember seeing this before. This is insane. It's just spectator mode. Oh, okay. Oh, I'm getting
[1958.89s -> 1974.68s]  something in my ear. All right, so there's too many people in spectator mode, which is crashing
[1974.68s -> 1980.01s]  the whole client. All right, let's just move on to the main event. No more stalling. Let's move on
[1980.01s -> 1986.31s]  to the main event. Let's do the main event. The main event is going to take like three hours,
[1986.31s -> 1989.99s]  and none of this shit will happen in the main event. I just wanted to give some padding.
[1989.99s -> 1998.15s]  There was supposed to be a little tournament, but there's 50 trillion people here.
[1998.15s -> 2014.10s]  Worse than Bugleberry. Yeah, it's all right. Yeah, it is. It's worse. That's fine. We wanted to fight.
[2131.80s -> 2234.58s]  Hello. Hi. Welcome back. Okay, if a stream is the worst stream of 2020, guaranteed,
[2234.58s -> 2238.42s]  we can remove it from the list, right? Like everything else is an honorable mention at this
[2238.42s -> 2247.61s]  point, right? Like this could just sit as like the worst stream of 2020. And then, you know,
[2247.61s -> 2254.44s]  we can vote on another one. That's fair, right? That's fair. That's fair, right?
[2256.10s -> 2263.46s]  No, we all agree. All right, I agree. We all agree. So what's the point of having to vote for it?
[2263.46s -> 2268.41s]  It's already stamped it. Throw it up. All right, here we go. We are going to move on.
[2269.05s -> 2282.28s]  We're going to try to do the actual main event of this stream. Oh, no. It's dead.
[2283.96s -> 2299.72s]  I'm going to put in Rattatouille quick. Should I open up the Rattatouille level?
[2300.28s -> 2311.26s]  I just, I can't. I'm not even streaming. Did you believe that? Emergency Rattatouille stream
[2311.26s -> 2330.63s]  incoming. Imagine, imagine the FTK stream becomes emergency Rattatouille stream.
[2331.19s -> 2339.14s]  Holy shit. That might be the most ridiculous thing ever. All right, we're going to try this again.
[2339.86s -> 2344.58s]  There's so much cool shit in this. There's so much. It's so much cool shit in this. You have
[2344.58s -> 2349.14s]  no idea, guys. We just wait. You got to see it. All right, we just have to see it. It's fucking
[2349.14s -> 2358.86s]  awesome. All right, we just got to get there. Do another Diablo 2 playthrough. Okay. Yeah,
[2358.86s -> 2381.14s]  maybe. All right, I'm in. Are we, are we good to go? Are we good to try? Go play Genshin Impact.
[2382.10s -> 2396.52s]  I don't even know what that is, but maybe. No, don't. You just said two words back to back.
[2396.52s -> 2407.75s]  I don't even know what they were. You said Genshin and then Impact. Please do, please do. I don't
[2407.75s -> 2425.56s]  even know what it is. It's a gotcha game. I don't know what it is. I don't know. Does somebody have
[2425.56s -> 2435.43s]  this up? Does that, does your skin say stream sucks? Oh, no. Germa sucks. Okay. All right. Hey,
[2435.43s -> 2441.43s]  we're going to try to do this. We're going to try to start this. Everybody pretend to be excited.
[2441.43s -> 2447.96s]  Everybody pretend to be floored by this coming up. All right. You ready? We're going to act.
[2447.96s -> 2454.60s]  This is acting class 101. Whoa, what the hell? Whoa, there's a dragon. Quick to the battlements.
[2455.24s -> 2460.71s]  Get yourselves a bow and arrow and some kind of, we're being attacked. The tournament has been
[2460.71s -> 2471.61s]  interrupted by a dragon. Hurry to the armaments. My inventory is full of dog shit. I don't want
[2471.61s -> 2483.46s]  any of this stuff. I need a bow and arrow. Oh, you can. We have to, we have to defeat this dragon.
[2483.46s -> 2494.09s]  Quickly to your king. Why do I have apples in my fucking. Apples and shit. Throwing snowballs.
[2494.09s -> 2503.69s]  This is the Argent tournament. Wow. Reference. Shut up. This is a lot of time.
[2505.53s -> 2512.36s]  All right, let's go. I got my bow and arrow. I need arrows. I need to actually need an arrow.
[2512.36s -> 2514.04s]  You only need one arrow. It's a magical bow.
[2516.20s -> 2531.74s]  Kill him. Excellent work. Excellent work. Watch out for the boss. Oh, shoot. He's killed like five
[2531.74s -> 2538.76s]  people. All right, we did it. Victory. The dragon has gone into hiding. Would you look at that? What
[2538.76s -> 2545.48s]  a surprise that would have been if it happened in the middle of a fucking tournament. Holy shit,
[2545.48s -> 2556.97s]  a lot of people died. Look at all this stuff on the ground. Jesus Christ. All right, here we go.
[2558.14s -> 2562.97s]  Wait, let's, let's go back to the town. What do you say? You guys think, let's go, let's go back.
[2562.97s -> 2565.77s]  Let's go back to the town. Let's get, let's, let's get this shit figured out.
[2568.30s -> 2579.72s]  That dragon just attacked the town. Tournamental. Oh, I sense something strange. I don't know about
[2579.72s -> 2591.88s]  any of you guys, but I, I sense something strange happening in the air. Real tragedy. What? All right,
[2591.88s -> 2600.31s]  let's head back. Anybody else sense something? Especially potentially somebody on the production
[2600.31s -> 2610.68s]  staff might sense where direction I should be heading. I don't know where it is. Where is it?
[2610.68s -> 2617.48s]  Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where's the thing that I have to touch?
[2627.66s -> 2634.62s]  My dream. I was like sleeping going, oh wow. The dragon attacks and there's a statue and wow.
[2636.23s -> 2645.91s]  Hey, where's this thing that I have to touch guy on production staff? Help me. That didn't happen in
[2645.91s -> 2659.59s]  my dream last night for this game. Where, where actually is it though? This is okay. Okay. When
[2659.59s -> 2665.75s]  you're like a little kid and you, in your mind, you have this elaborate thing play out the way
[2665.75s -> 2671.77s]  that you're talking the way. Whoa, wait, hold on. What's that? Hey fellas, fellas, I found it.
[2673.21s -> 2695.10s]  Hey fellas, I found it. What's this over here? There's a cave system over here. Look out. The
[2695.10s -> 2706.76s]  dragon escaped. Come back to the Coliseum and check it out. Something happened here. Why is
[2706.76s -> 2716.09s]  everybody listening to me? The only person over here. I'm just playing it alone. Is anybody
[2716.09s -> 2732.78s]  listening? Oh, oh, oh my chest. That's so sad, but funny at the same time. No one's listening to me.
[2732.78s -> 2751.70s]  Oh, we are here for Steve. I see people. I see people. Wait, I gotta go in. I want experiences
[2751.70s -> 2758.41s]  too. I want to see this. I'm on fire. Why am I in fire? How do I put myself out? I'm on fire.
[2758.41s -> 2772.76s]  All right, boys. I'm on fire. All right, everybody quick into the, into the portal.
[2772.76s -> 2777.53s]  Okay. What I was going to say is you know, when you're like a little kid and you inside of your
[2777.53s -> 2783.98s]  head, when you're like 10, 11, 12 years old and you just see and hear this elaborate thing that
[2783.98s -> 2789.45s]  you're making up, like you have a dragon flying by in your head and you're fighting with a sword
[2789.45s -> 2796.25s]  outside. It's like recess or whatever. And it's like real life out there. That's how I felt it
[2796.25s -> 2800.78s]  was going to be. But like in reality, when like the teachers look out the window to recess, they
[2800.78s -> 2806.54s]  see like two like little shits just like moving around in circles, going like dragon. Look out
[2806.54s -> 2814.86s]  for the dragon. But in their head, it's like a fucking movie. That's how I felt today.
[2817.62s -> 2822.26s]  Anyways, welcome. Uh, we're in some kind of dungeon right now. I think we need to
[2822.26s -> 2830.79s]  find our way out of this fucking dungeon. We need to go find the king's sword.
[2832.62s -> 2842.66s]  I can't even, we're on an RP right now. Find the king's sword at recess. Everybody in.
[2846.81s -> 2852.14s]  You got to get it one at a time. Not too many people go in the hot tub. Be careful. You can
[2852.14s -> 2859.96s]  die in here. This actually is dangerous in here. Be careful. We got to make our way and find the
[2859.96s -> 2869.56s]  king's sword. Careful. Careful. What the hell? What, what the hell is that? All right. There's
[2869.56s -> 2880.55s]  like a super creeper over here. Kill it. It's like Harry Potter. It's the creeper king.
[2881.19s -> 2891.53s]  Oh shit. Fuck that. Is this the new update? No, no, it's not. No, it's not. This is Minecraft
[2891.53s -> 2909.74s]  1.8.9. Someone feed in the pool. Kill this thing. Wait, can we hurt this thing? He's kind of just
[2909.74s -> 2921.22s]  looking at people. It's going to explode. The pool is closed. No, the pool is open. You just
[2921.22s -> 2931.27s]  got to go in it. Oh no, I see what's happening. People are killing each other. This guy has a
[2931.27s -> 2941.30s]  weapon. Don't fight each other. Fight the creeper king. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2941.30s -> 2957.62s]  We're supposed to be working together. Did anybody even hurt him? Is he just an NPC for fun? I think
[2957.62s -> 2962.23s]  he's invincible. Do we need to do anything in particular? Do we need to like dump like water
[2962.23s -> 2966.31s]  on him or something? People are trying to leave. I think we have to kill this thing. How do we kill
[2966.31s -> 2974.60s]  it? Oh shit, he's on fire. Wait, wait, wait. Shoot him with arrows. He's not even trying to hurt
[2974.60s -> 2991.37s]  anybody. I think I just headshot somebody and killed them. Well, what was that? Where the
[2991.37s -> 3009.56s]  explosion? I can't even tell if we're hurting him. This guy just lives here. We're just like
[3009.56s -> 3024.87s]  fucking up his whole house. I think there's explosions too. Oh, I think we have to hit the
[3024.87s -> 3049.16s]  bottom part. Hit the bottom part? Where is he? He kind of blends in with people that have diamond
[3049.16s -> 3055.54s]  armor on. Wait, there's two of them. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There are two of these guys?
[3056.50s -> 3069.56s]  What? This guy's bigger. Oh shit. Oh my God. I'm going to die. Oh fuck. All right. I'm going
[3069.56s -> 3089.86s]  this way. Who's like a friend or foe? Shit. I'm sorry. What that was? I literally just headshot
[3089.86s -> 3104.63s]  somebody and killed him. How much health does he have? RDM. There's so many arrows everywhere too.
[3104.63s -> 3121.42s]  This is fucking ridiculous. No one snowballs at him. That's not going to work. Is he dead?
[3123.05s -> 3131.30s]  I'm going to die in a second. I'm dead. Oh shit. Why do I have 10 lives? I'm supposed to have a
[3131.30s -> 3138.39s]  thousand. Oh my fucking God. This stuff all over the floor. I don't even know what I picked up.
[3138.39s -> 3156.06s]  What happened? I'm naked. Do I still? Oh shit. Is he spawned? No, I don't. Nine lives. That's not
[3156.06s -> 3176.33s]  I'm flying around. Shit. Someone has my lightning stick. Oh fuck they do. Somebody has the stick.
[3176.33s -> 3188.98s]  That's why. That's what lightning strikes are. Somebody took it. All right. I died.
[3194.18s -> 3197.46s]  I can put, I can turn on God mode, but I don't think I need it. How much? Hey,
[3198.66s -> 3234.90s]  how much health mods? Somebody said somebody has this sound way up. How do we kill this guy?
[3236.02s -> 3247.13s]  Why is there an Enderman in here? Does anybody have a weapon I can borrow? Why don't I have a
[3247.13s -> 3266.12s]  fucking weapon? Do it louder please. Is there, is there audio to turn down? There we go. Do we
[3266.12s -> 3282.26s]  know how much health this guy has? I feel like we're playing Destiny. Destiny 3. Shit. I died
[3282.26s -> 3310.44s]  again. I'm killing this motherfucker right now. How do I do it? I'm in God mode. Let's kill this
[3310.44s -> 3323.80s]  motherfucker. I'm going to hit him up. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. I can't PvP here.
[3324.36s -> 3350.31s]  No phase. I can't, I can't even hurt him. Fix the Q. Is the Q server fucked up? Yes it is.
[3352.57s -> 3364.79s]  Uh, they're saying the Q server is fucked up. Game server's all right. You can TP to people? You
[3364.79s -> 3378.15s]  can. All right. How do we instantly kill this guy? How do we kill this thing? We're just like
[3378.15s -> 3390.04s]  bullying this fucking creeper. German, just swallow your pride and play Ratatouille.
[3393.11s -> 3415.62s]  Look, it works. We're in. Well, I'm staying. How did everybody get all this diamond armor?
[3415.62s -> 3423.91s]  All right. Let's move. He's dead. He's been killed. We got to go through this through here.
[3425.83s -> 3450.54s]  I'd kill all. Where's the next room? Oh, it's all the way back here. Am I looking the right way?
[3450.54s -> 3456.20s]  I actually can't believe this many people are in here right now. So all the way to the back wall
[3456.20s -> 3473.70s]  here. Oh, here we go. All right. Follow me in next room. We're going to find that sword.
[3474.95s -> 3478.23s]  Wait, easy, easy. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. Don't go so fast.
[3488.01s -> 3496.55s]  I can't see anything. There's too many people. It's a giant maze. There's too many people in here.
[3497.19s -> 3507.30s]  There's too many. I'm fucking claustrophobic right now. I actually kind of like it. You can't
[3507.30s -> 3520.50s]  break it. We've got to, somebody's got to find the exit. It's a maze. All right. Split up, split up.
[3520.50s -> 3529.26s]  Don't all go the same way. We have to split up. Is there a fucking, is there an enderman in here too?
[3531.67s -> 3541.08s]  All right. Split up, split up. We've got to find the exit. Does somebody have an enderman skin?
[3541.72s -> 3557.72s]  All right. Good. Progress, progress, progress. I see name plates everywhere. Good. Spread out,
[3557.72s -> 3579.08s]  spread as far out as you can. That way? No? Let's go this way. Why am I seeing omega lulls right now?
[3579.08s -> 3588.22s]  Why is everybody laughing? I see omega lull, omega lull, omega lull, omega lull.
[3588.22s -> 3596.86s]  Really? You put a maze in here? You're insane. I think there's like a couple. Good luck. Yeah,
[3596.86s -> 3605.18s]  it's not nothing. This is some fucking hard shit here. All right. We have to be getting close to
[3605.18s -> 3630.39s]  the end. I hear the enderman. I feel like we're making really good progress. Ice cream Hong Kong.
[3630.39s -> 3638.42s]  Yeah. All right. I've watched Beetlejuice too. It was a funny movie. Oh, wait. There's a bottleneck
[3638.42s -> 3646.65s]  here. One at a time. Progress towards what? Towards, we get towards the exit. We're going
[3646.65s -> 3659.67s]  to go through the dungeon. How far, how, how much progress have we made? Anybody on production want
[3659.67s -> 3674.60s]  to tell me? Curious, I wonder. Black Friday POV. Get in there. I got to get a new Wii.
[3676.42s -> 3685.42s]  How, how far are we? Oh, we're, we're good. We're, we're halfway, like almost halfway there.
[3691.38s -> 3702.97s]  Oh, I told you splitting up was a good idea. Oh, I, I just turned around. I got turned around.
[3702.97s -> 3709.50s]  Wait, am I going the wrong way? Oh shit. Wait, where? I was going the right way,
[3709.50s -> 3715.16s]  but then I got turned around. I have no idea. Oh, stop whispering me that shit. All right.
[3715.72s -> 3728.82s]  Time to ban that person. Q server limits 400 right now. Could be a lot more than that.
[3728.82s -> 3734.76s]  Is this the wrong way? Oh shit. Hold on. Guys, we're going the wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong,
[3734.76s -> 3743.82s]  wrong, wrong, wrong. Turn around. Yeah. If you're not in the maze, by the way, guys,
[3743.82s -> 3749.18s]  if you're not in this current room, if you, if you type slash die, you're going to lose a life,
[3749.18s -> 3753.02s]  but you will end up at the beginning of the maze. So if you're all the way back and like,
[3753.02s -> 3760.73s]  oh shit, I can't fucking go anywhere. You do slash die. You will end up at the beginning
[3760.73s -> 3769.06s]  of the maze. Shit. All right. I got to pay attention. Am I going with this? People are
[3769.06s -> 3783.37s]  walking forward backwards. Oh fuck. Is anybody, is anybody close? Once somebody beats it, we all
[3783.37s -> 3800.70s]  win. This way, this way, this way. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Go, go, go, go, go. I'm so close.
[3800.70s -> 3810.01s]  Keep going. Yeah. Yeah. Shit. I thought the turn, I'm turning chat off like fucking Wally. All
[3810.01s -> 3820.71s]  right. I got to turn this off. Somebody said that. Why did I read that shit? God damn it.
[3820.71s -> 3829.94s]  All right. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Turn around. I feel like we're just ants.
[3831.02s -> 3834.86s]  Isn't this how ants work? One ant picks the direction and lays down like ant fluid and
[3834.86s -> 3839.51s]  all the other ants follow the ant fluid. Who's the lead ant right now? Somebody has to be lead ant.
[3841.37s -> 3844.97s]  All right. Why don't you take over lead ant? It's not going to be me. Somebody take over. I'm going
[3845.93s -> 3857.93s]  to bless one of you. All right. I can't see. How about, all right. Scales. Scales 7744.
[3857.93s -> 3868.60s]  Wow. That's the new lead ant. Everybody follow him. He's got like a green t-shirt and jeans on.
[3868.60s -> 3880.22s]  Follow a guy with the green shirt on. You know where you're going? Is somebody there?
[3880.78s -> 3889.11s]  Did somebody do it? Oh, they, somebody got, somebody got really close and then they,
[3889.11s -> 3894.25s]  they turned around and got fucked up. Shit. Oh my God. All right. This way.
[3894.97s -> 3902.09s]  I don't even know if I'm going the right direction or not. I think we just want to circle.
[3906.22s -> 3924.26s]  Oh my God. Okay. Over here and then right. Yep. Right here. Okay. And then, and then this way
[3924.26s -> 3938.12s]  and then left. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Follow Tingy. Tingy's got it. Tingy's got it.
[3938.12s -> 3941.40s]  Welcome to, by the way, welcome to Minecraft day, everybody. Didn't know that was today.
[3946.63s -> 3962.57s]  Minecon 2020. Oh no. I just got, I just got word in my ear, guys, that we are going the 100%
[3962.57s -> 3967.05s]  wrong direction. We turned around and went the wrong way. We're running backwards now.
[3968.38s -> 3978.54s]  Uh, not going the right way at all. Back this way. All right. I'm going to give this 10 more
[3978.54s -> 3994.22s]  minutes, five more minutes before I start taking balls down. Holy shit. That guy's huge. What
[3994.22s -> 4011.90s]  happened to the one guy that was almost done? See, is he still getting close? Is everybody just
[4011.90s -> 4022.22s]  hopelessly lost? This is just a way to keep us busy. Somebody said career ending stream.
[4024.02s -> 4041.02s]  Oh, whatever. That was a good run. Sir, you are fired. That's all right. It was pretty good.
[4041.02s -> 4052.49s]  It was pretty fun. He's talking about me. All right. I'm taking balls down. I'm taking balls
[4052.49s -> 4054.81s]  down. I want to go to the next room. I want to go, I don't want to do this anymore. I want to go to
[4054.81s -> 4067.35s]  the next room. How do I do this? Too hard. I don't know where we're going. Nobody knows where they're
[4067.35s -> 4088.50s]  going. Okay. So I'm just going to start taking walls down. I don't have a pickaxe. What? I need
[4088.50s -> 4110.70s]  a pickaxe. Somebody give me a pickaxe. I can't break walls. Can I actually not cheat? Oh shit.
[4110.70s -> 4113.58s]  All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Hopefully I'm facing the
[4113.58s -> 4128.01s]  right direction. Oh shit. I fell through the world. Oh no. Please tell me you can see this.
[4128.57s -> 4163.88s]  I'm killing everybody. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. No. I'm sorry. I tried. I tried. I killed like 10
[4163.88s -> 4176.84s]  people. 20 people at least just died. All right. Don't look at the ground and hit the ground.
[4176.84s -> 4181.40s]  All right. Wait. I made it to the end of the maze. I made it to the end of the maze guys.
[4181.40s -> 4201.06s]  I did it. Pog. Look. Oh shit. Hold on. I gotta change this. All right. Come on in. Look where I
[4201.06s -> 4210.49s]  am. Hey. I made it to the end of the maze guys. Is anybody even close? Nobody's even remotely
[4210.49s -> 4220.30s]  close. Why is somebody on top? All right. If you hit slash die, you're going to come to me.
[4221.10s -> 4231.70s]  Put it on easy mode. Yeah. I kind of did, didn't I? What's the next room? There's a bear in here.
[4236.10s -> 4249.45s]  All right. Careful. Careful. Careful. Careful. This is a jumping map. The queue thinks that
[4249.45s -> 4253.85s]  there's four. Well, there is only 400 people in the server. How the queue system works is it pulls
[4253.85s -> 4260.81s]  you in when somebody else here dies. You'll be in the queue until somebody here is gone. At least
[4260.81s -> 4265.58s]  that's how it's kind of supposed to work. Oh, there goes somebody. Okay. Okay. This is a jump
[4265.58s -> 4277.54s]  map. Be careful. Let us out. There's only two. Oh, the server. Okay. Right. The server thinks
[4277.54s -> 4284.30s]  there's 400 people. I see. I see what you're saying. So the server, the queue server still
[4284.30s -> 4290.06s]  thinks there's 400 people. So it's booting people because it thinks there's supposed to be 400 in
[4290.06s -> 4293.66s]  here, but there's only 250 from the kind of extreme thing we had to do at the very beginning
[4293.66s -> 4309.24s]  of this room. All right. Let me turn this off. How are you guys even making these jumps in the
[4309.24s -> 4323.59s]  first place? I can't even see to make the first jump. Nobody's already doing very well. How can
[4323.59s -> 4344.34s]  you even see this first jump? Hold on. People are falling, but not dying. You can climb back up.
[4344.34s -> 4349.38s]  Okay. This guy is seriously, he's beating the whole thing. How are you this good at this?
[4350.02s -> 4355.54s]  Half of us can't even get past the first jump. Are you fucking kidding me? Did this guy beat it
[4355.54s -> 4385.66s]  already? Wow. Look at this guy go. Did you just beat it? He's going to sit here and taunt us.
[4385.66s -> 4392.97s]  Hold on. Let me, let me, let me, I want to get a good view of this. How do I do that? I'm actually
[4392.97s -> 4409.45s]  really surprised that he was able to do that. He's the real king. Yeah. Well, no, I'm the real king,
[4409.45s -> 4412.65s]  but he can be the one that's on camera because he's doing something interesting instead of just
[4412.65s -> 4424.34s]  falling off the same first jump. You can tell where the bottleneck is because where every single
[4424.34s -> 4438.12s]  person is here. There's a major bottleneck at this jump here. It's just inside people's heads.
[4439.64s -> 4444.65s]  All right. You got to jump to get a good view. I'm afraid if I walk forward, I'm going to die.
[4445.29s -> 4466.18s]  Okay. I'm good. He could just sit here and taunt us. What's that? What's that command to make it so
[4466.18s -> 4481.05s]  you can't see anybody but you? Oh, that didn't work. Slash hide. Oh, one word. Oh shit. This is
[4481.05s -> 4486.52s]  way easier. I can actually see what the hell I'm doing. Oh, this is awesome. This is cool.
[4486.52s -> 4493.58s]  Just cut away from me. Cut away from me. Cut away from me. Cut away from me. I don't want
[4493.58s -> 4505.86s]  anyone to see anything that I'm doing. Fucking give me a break. I can't. How do you get that
[4505.86s -> 4521.75s]  first one there? People are making pretty good progress though. I got it. I got it. I'm good.
[4522.39s -> 4535.11s]  Got it. Are they throwing shit at me? All right. I'm good here. There's a lava portion. How many
[4535.11s -> 4551.29s]  people are at the lava portion? Oh, fuck. It's okay. It's all right. I'm good. No. What happened?
[4551.29s -> 4558.84s]  He didn't make it in the water. He didn't make it. I'm trying to win. I don't even know. I can't
[4558.84s -> 4573.21s]  see what you guys are looking at. I'm going to try to jump. Am I going the... I don't know
[4573.21s -> 4589.56s]  if I'm going the right way. This looks right. Oh shit. How do I jump on this? What? Oh, he fell.
[4589.56s -> 4609.93s]  He fell at the cactus. No. Really? That's too bad. I don't understand this jump here. I kind
[4609.93s -> 4613.93s]  of want to turn... Okay. I'm going to turn my shit back on because I can't tell what to do here.
[4613.93s -> 4644.15s]  Hide all, right? So how do you jump around this? Oh, you have to go down. Oh shit. Okay. What? No,
[4644.15s -> 4661.51s]  you don't? Well, you have to grab the ladder. Shit. Okay. I wasn't paying attention to that.
[4661.51s -> 4677.06s]  Oh my fucking God. Whatever. These are all the rejects down here. Oh, damn it. He didn't sprint.
[4677.06s -> 4704.55s]  Oh, somebody said they just got banned. Well, what did you do? Is there any... He's going to
[4704.55s -> 4712.87s]  the end? Is there any way we can make the server queue system be actually 250 and not 400? Because
[4712.87s -> 4717.27s]  what's happening is it's getting to... Someone's going to be being allowed to be let in, but it's
[4717.27s -> 4721.35s]  immediately booting them because the server thinks that there's supposed to be 400 slots.
[4721.35s -> 4731.96s]  I don't know if they can look into that somehow. Did it? You actually did it.
[4732.68s -> 4747.64s]  Who did it? Which one? They deserve a gold helmet for that. Isn't LNV... LNV-42. Where are you?
[4749.66s -> 4757.50s]  You... This is what you get for completing the mission. LNV-42. Yeah, are they...
[4758.22s -> 4769.72s]  TP me to LNV-42. Oh, they're right behind me. Oh, there you are. Here, take this gold helmet. You
[4769.72s -> 4784.34s]  deserve it. You get it? Nice job. Congratulations. You completed the jumping map. Somebody has two
[4784.34s -> 4802.87s]  lives left. Well, be careful. All right, let's keep going. Let's continue. Follow me. Is this a
[4802.87s -> 4808.98s]  maze? Wait, is this just a long... Remember, if you have lives remaining, hit slash die and you will
[4808.98s -> 4813.16s]  start at the beginning. This is a maze again. Yeah, this is a maze. This one looks easier,
[4813.16s -> 4828.76s]  though. Take that, though. All right. I mean, why wouldn't I? Don't open. Why not? I do hide all
[4828.76s -> 4844.79s]  again. Yeah, those of you that can... You guys listening for the server side of stuff, can
[4844.79s -> 4847.83s]  somebody look into the whole queue thing because I think people are actually getting just booted
[4848.31s -> 4858.38s]  just by being brought in. Okay, cool. I don't want to hide all players, though, because then I can't
[4858.38s -> 4890.44s]  cheat and follow somebody. Redstone? Everybody... Why is everybody saying, holy shit? This is an
[4890.44s -> 4897.64s]  algorithm maze? Is everybody saying this is going to take hours? No, the other one took like 10
[4897.64s -> 4917.91s]  minutes for someone to get to the end. Pressure plates, too. I don't know. What do they do?
[4917.91s -> 4932.20s]  I see name tags. Shit, we were already here. This is wrong. I remember this is the diamond.
[4932.20s -> 4954.06s]  That's where I got the diamond. Shit. This way? Everyone wants to get TP to the end of the parkour
[4954.06s -> 4963.46s]  course, say in chat. Well, if you want to... Wait, why can I see you? Wait, did I beat it? Oh, no.
[4963.46s -> 4968.47s]  Shit, this is the beginning of the level. This is the very beginning of the game. I went all the way
[4968.47s -> 4982.87s]  in the back. I went all the way back. Okay, I'll get it. Here we go. If you do slash die, you will
[4982.87s -> 4991.50s]  appear right at the beginning of the maze. This way. There's the diamond. I'm going to make some
[4991.50s -> 5004.76s]  Hansel and Gretel shit here, okay? Yes, I can. Nope, this way. This is going to last six hours.
[5004.76s -> 5009.00s]  No, it won't. I have the magic of the fucking staff. I can just break through a wall if I want.
[5009.00s -> 5022.34s]  Okay, yeah, they're working on the queue thing right now. That's what they're telling me.
[5022.34s -> 5032.10s]  Yeah, people can still come in, but there's just a problem with the actual number. It's running into
[5032.10s -> 5038.63s]  itself, essentially. They're trying to figure it out. Stop cheating. I'm just collecting samples.
[5038.63s -> 5051.67s]  All right. How did I go the wrong way? Here, come this way. I know I just fucking cheated,
[5051.67s -> 5071.00s]  but it's all right. Well, how did you guys do that? That's kind of unfair. That's unfair.
[5071.00s -> 5080.57s]  And I even blocked it too, so they can't go that way. I'm just checking on how people are doing,
[5080.57s -> 5084.73s]  and I don't have to beat this. I just have to check on people. Oh, fuck, you got in. It's all
[5084.73s -> 5109.54s]  right. All right, let me see where people are. Nice. That's a pretty cool costume, dude. All right.
[5109.54s -> 5119.83s]  Hey, how close are we? How far away from the end are we at this stage now? We are absolutely nowhere
[5119.83s -> 5134.76s]  near the end of this maze. Not even close. All right. Well, what if I do this? All right,
[5135.24s -> 5148.33s]  somebody might actually beat it, he said. Wait, do people... Am I the only one that can do this?
[5148.33s -> 5164.98s]  I got banned, and the reason listed was A. A, well, cut it out. I'm just a helper. I'm just helping.
[5164.98s -> 5171.75s]  Somebody is apparently close to the end, or at least close enough. I kind of want to see. I want
[5171.75s -> 5185.86s]  to look over here. Can I see? I want to see where everybody is. I have no idea where the hell I'm
[5185.86s -> 5195.24s]  supposed to be going right now. Is that a Snorlax? That's a Snorlax costume. Hey, guys, I found
[5195.24s -> 5210.36s]  another way. That person has a Minecon cape? Yeah, this is today. Why are we doing this? It's a
[5210.36s -> 5219.32s]  Minecraft day. Can I be TP to the maze, please? Type slash die. You will be at the very beginning.
[5219.32s -> 5234.26s]  Hey, what about if I had to take this one? It's a Minecraft Minecon 2013 shirt. That's the rare
[5234.26s -> 5259.72s]  one. I feel like I'm making this harder. Did somebody beat it? Who beat it? Hold on. What was
[5259.72s -> 5290.31s]  it? GM3? Oh my fucking God. There are people that are really are right at the end. You're so close.
[5290.31s -> 5299.51s]  Oh, wow. You guys are so close. You're almost there. It's right here. Oh, you did it. Somebody
[5299.51s -> 5305.34s]  actually did it. A lot of you did it. Holy shit. Almost all of you did it. Where was I? What the
[5305.34s -> 5318.73s]  hell was I doing? How far was I? How far away was I? I was like three quarters. This is a cool
[5318.73s -> 5335.72s]  looking level. They're TPing to you. Oh, sit on. All right, what's in here? Oh, we got a boss battle.
[5336.36s -> 5342.17s]  All the servers or queue servers are down. Yeah, I think that they're coming down because I think
[5342.17s -> 5350.17s]  they're trying to apply a fix to make it so people can get in. Oh, this motherfucker has a health bar.
[5350.17s -> 5364.47s]  Get him. What's his name? The Ender Knight? If you hit slash die, you'll get teleported into this room,
[5364.47s -> 5379.27s]  everybody. This is unfair. This dude is, he can't even move. We keep going into these people's
[5379.27s -> 5388.34s]  really cool looking houses. Oh, wait, fuck. Look at this stuff. There's like little bugs all over
[5388.34s -> 5409.16s]  the ground. Did we just cheese him? No, he still has health. Stun lock penetration. So he's shitting
[5409.16s -> 5428.55s]  out these little bugs. Do these bugs hurt? It's just everywhere. I can't even kill them fast enough.
[5429.19s -> 5446.06s]  Get him. Yeah, get him. Oh, all right. Did the Ender Knight just win with a walk off grand slam
[5446.06s -> 5461.10s]  in the world series? I don't even know where he is. Everybody's swarming this guy. I'm just
[5461.10s -> 5467.32s]  waiting for a Gatorade jump to be dumped on his head. Just kill him. Don't even let him do
[5467.32s -> 5485.26s]  anything. Just don't even let him move. Is anybody even dead? I don't think he's hurt anybody.
[5486.47s -> 5492.71s]  I don't think he can. I think he's been stun locked the whole time. Don't you die if an Enderman
[5492.71s -> 5512.38s]  looks at you for like five seconds. He can't even look at anybody. He needs more ram. He's
[5512.38s -> 5526.31s]  going to be dead air in a second. Need more wham? Wham? Oh, okay. I know what you're doing.
[5526.31s -> 5535.69s]  How did everybody get diamond armor just quickly? Is there armaments that they could get into?
[5536.81s -> 5545.32s]  Somebody said, sorry, but I'm officially lost in the maze. Yeah, man. I feel you. I feel you, dude.
[5545.32s -> 5551.24s]  I know. If you want to give up a life, you can do slash die and get in here. I know, man. It's
[5551.24s -> 5565.02s]  fucking rough. Are you in the first maze? If you're in the first maze, I know, man. It's hard. It's
[5565.02s -> 5583.54s]  really hard. We kill him. I think we killed him. Hello? Wait, what? Oh, he's dead. We got it.
[5583.54s -> 5588.92s]  All right. Let's go. Nice. We got it. Look at this. Look at that dragon. That's a pretty sick
[5588.92s -> 5600.81s]  dragon. Wait until maze three. Well, we'll see. All right. Coming up next, we have what I think
[5601.29s -> 5620.60s]  is it another jump map? Oh, god damn it. I fell already. All right. I actually want to do this one
[5620.60s -> 5635.82s]  right. This looks fun. This looks fun. I want to do this right. You only get 10 lives. Keep that in
[5635.82s -> 5651.91s]  mind. Be careful. Oh shit. Are we going to get a jump maze? That'd be really funny actually.
[5651.91s -> 5660.86s]  Anyone else getting, I'm not going to say that. This is a mine cough, mine, uh, guy, mine con
[5660.86s -> 5681.05s]  stream. I almost said conference. Fucking god damn it. All right. Whatever. Let's go. I'm
[5681.05s -> 5706.39s]  going to play mine con day stream. Not mine conference day. Rear ending blunder.
[5710.47s -> 5730.79s]  What? How did you beat it already? What the fuck? Look at this guy. Oh my god. No way.
[5734.47s -> 5740.66s]  There's a couple of people that are doing really well. I, this is not a paid actor. I prompt now,
[5740.66s -> 5754.10s]  cut to my camera. This is us normal people. Okay. Some of you are not even jumping. You're just
[5754.10s -> 5776.26s]  walking off and dying. I just kind of like watching. This is, oh, they can't see the edge.
[5776.26s -> 5784.54s]  Yeah. I guess that's true. What the fuck is that? Wait, is that, I thought that was in the wall.
[5784.54s -> 5803.24s]  Wait, that's not, that's a person. Paid actors. No. So many people. So people have, this is first
[5803.24s -> 5807.80s]  jump of the stair with the ladder. People have a lot of problem with, I'd get down there to it
[5807.80s -> 5814.28s]  myself, but you know, I, you know, it's kind of fun to see what people do. You have four. Yeah.
[5814.28s -> 5829.72s]  If you've got, try to hold on to those lives. They're precious. If I go down here, it's really
[5829.72s -> 5836.46s]  interesting to see. This group right here is really, really doing pretty well. I think they're
[5836.46s -> 5841.93s]  working together. I think they're playing together. Oh, that guy tried to just flex so hard and he
[5841.93s -> 5849.51s]  dropped. That was a huge flex that guy was trying to do. He was going like world one, one Mario
[5849.51s -> 5859.42s]  strat. You just don't stop moving. Somebody's shooting an arrow at me. It's not going to work,
[5859.42s -> 5874.07s]  man. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to try. I want to try now. Do some shout casting. Okay.
[5874.07s -> 5883.00s]  Yeah, sure. Welcome to the entrance of the dungeon here. We have quite a few players.
[5883.00s -> 5891.32s]  We've got, uh, Ko Hagen here, Ko, Ko seven, Ko Hagen here, uh, taking a look over the
[5892.20s -> 5897.40s]  edge of the world here, like a few of his fellow players. We also have, uh, him and his team there.
[5897.40s -> 5901.08s]  There's a, there's two, 16 teams of 25 people at the same time.
[5904.89s -> 5908.89s]  Palm seal making a big jump board gets to there. I'm not sure what happened next. He looks like
[5908.89s -> 5913.58s]  he's stuffed underneath all the players. Really, really bad spot to be him. And you can't see,
[5913.58s -> 5920.38s]  hopefully he has his hide slash all, uh, activated. We've got El Qwerty, Qwerty keyboard up here. Nice
[5920.38s -> 5927.21s]  jump onto the tire. Nice jump onto the tires. Can he make it all the way up around? He can go over
[5927.21s -> 5933.56s]  the top. Here comes one of the hardest jumps of the entire event. Can he got it? El Qwerty
[5934.98s -> 5941.70s]  showing us how to do it. Falling down into the pool. This is the tough part and he makes it too.
[5941.70s -> 5949.19s]  We're following Qwerty here, folks doing an excellent job. Now he's got this. He gots the
[5949.19s -> 5953.43s]  double ladder jump to make now crouching. Make sure to fall off by the, if you don't play Minecraft,
[5953.43s -> 5960.07s]  if you crouch, you don't fall off. He's using that to his advantage. Oh, Qwerty pretty gone.
[5960.71s -> 5974.95s]  Oh, we have the court jester. That guy is naked. Oh, he's naked. There are people that aren't even
[5974.95s -> 5986.71s]  trying. They're shooting with arrows. Come on. Come on. Super Daza. Super Daza. That was a couple
[5986.71s -> 5998.78s]  of really good jumps in a row. Let's see it. Line it up. Oh, he got it. Got it. Dude, no.
[6001.50s -> 6013.35s]  Hey, come on. Quit hogging the little steak here, man. Is this person just naked? No. This looks
[6013.35s -> 6020.76s]  like the hard one because you have to balance on this and then jump to here. That person has a plus
[6020.76s -> 6038.17s]  two germacraft joke. I'm going for it. I want to be one of the people here. This is what it's like.
[6038.17s -> 6064.14s]  How do you grab a ladder? This whole W, right? A. Oh, I just showed you I was cheating. What is A?
[6064.14s -> 6073.70s]  Why are people being banned for A? I don't know. I have no idea. What does A mean? What a jump that
[6073.70s -> 6081.14s]  was. Oh, I had some lag there. Having a little bit of lag. I'm okay. Game's kind of laggy. It's
[6081.14s -> 6087.70s]  probably the server issues. There's a server problem sometimes. All right, I'm on. Yeah, I think
[6088.26s -> 6094.97s]  don't know what A means. Because we had to quickly just turn off the server and make it 250 instead
[6094.97s -> 6101.19s]  of 400, something got messed up and they're trying to figure it out. I will tell you this.
[6101.19s -> 6106.90s]  This server is just going to be on after this is over. This stream essentially is a gigantic
[6106.90s -> 6111.38s]  advertisement for the fact that this is going to stay turned on for 24-7 and it's going to just
[6111.38s -> 6115.78s]  kind of turn into like a Minecraft server. There's a giant advertisement for it. You're going to be
[6115.78s -> 6125.30s]  able to play through this whenever you want. Sellout. It's not a sellout. It's the server
[6125.30s -> 6141.67s]  that's my name. Are we going to do a fire festival stream? I don't want to play your damn maze.
[6142.63s -> 6160.23s]  Stay. I can do the maze. Ego maniac sellout. That's so funny. All right, this is a hard one.
[6160.79s -> 6172.52s]  Let's fucking watch out for the wind. There's Mario wind. If you fall off the edge, watch out
[6172.52s -> 6192.62s]  for the wind. See? What a recovery. I want to try this jump here with nobody here. Let me turn it
[6192.62s -> 6202.18s]  off. That doesn't work. Yeah. Remember if you're stuck somewhere, if you're in an old game,
[6202.82s -> 6220.70s]  I slash die. Fuck, I actually made it. This is a fire festival stream. Yeah, that's all right.
[6222.22s -> 6231.29s]  At least it works. An hour ago, I didn't think it was even going to work. It's actually kind of cool.
[6231.29s -> 6242.82s]  It's actually fun. Can you pause the stream? Can you pause the stream? I need to eat my
[6242.82s -> 6259.70s]  pasta. Just go. It's all right. You're not going to miss much. I'm still going to be falling on
[6259.70s -> 6279.14s]  the same jump every time. He hates his viewers. What? No, I can't. These people that have beat it.
[6279.86s -> 6291.61s]  That's over 50%. I think we can go to the next arena. Yeah, that's a lot of people. That's enough
[6291.61s -> 6310.23s]  to keep going. Pause it. Pause it. I've actually seen shit. Final Fantasy 6? 8? How do we keep
[6310.23s -> 6332.97s]  going? 7. Right, right, right. How come I can't see anything? I said the one's in between. Yeah,
[6332.97s -> 6347.67s]  yeah. How come I can't hide at all? All right, what is this one? King's Armory is this way.
[6348.63s -> 6363.99s]  Oh, this is where we've got the diamond shit. Nice. I got to put this all on. What am I stuck
[6363.99s -> 6395.10s]  in? Cement? What's this one? It's a big springboard. This barrow all over the ground.
[6395.18s -> 6422.62s]  Do you have a health bar too? Mr. Slime Boss. What about the raid loot? Is there any raid loot?
[6422.62s -> 6436.49s]  I think there might be something falling out of them. This is some good book reading music.
[6448.07s -> 6465.93s]  He just destroyed that guy. That guy was nothing. This area is really cool looking.
[6472.73s -> 6481.58s]  That looks awesome. All right, on to the next one. Let's go. Where's the next room? Down here.
[6491.06s -> 6501.88s]  Here we go. Boys and girls, it looks like it's going to be time for a maze. Oh, no, no, no,
[6501.88s -> 6514.78s]  no. Never mind. Oh, this room is actually really, really cool. How are you all the way up there
[6514.78s -> 6541.54s]  already? I don't understand. From the OST back up? Not too loud though. Man of three voices,
[6541.54s -> 6557.08s]  man of three mini games. Get out of here. That was pretty good. That was pretty good. That was
[6557.08s -> 6574.89s]  really funny. But ban that person for an hour. I just got in my ear with it working on this stuff
[6574.89s -> 6578.01s]  on the other side and just said, are you just shooting into the crowd? And I didn't realize
[6578.01s -> 6597.19s]  that. Yeah, I'm just shooting into the fucking crowd. So who this is, it's ice blocks. Oh,
[6597.19s -> 6615.51s]  fuck that. I ain't going to be able to do that one. Oh, nice try. Yeah. You can barely even see the
[6615.51s -> 6630.58s]  blocks. Someone will get it. The cycle of life. Man of three voices, man of three mini games.
[6631.78s -> 6644.74s]  I nominate that for a moment. Melon Boy. Oh, wait, no, that was what you're supposed to do.
[6645.30s -> 6665.75s]  Was it? Some of the guys that were part corn really well. This looks tricky for them. And
[6665.75s -> 6670.78s]  green tea sips. He's killing people. Oh, well, at some point somebody got my lightning stick
[6670.78s -> 6680.70s]  and just started casting it at random people. I don't even know where that is now. I have no
[6680.70s -> 6704.22s]  idea where it is. All right. Four or five people have made it here. Here are the saviors of this
[6704.22s -> 6732.36s]  level. Green tea sips has committed a get rid of them. What does any of this have to do with the
[6732.36s -> 6739.26s]  king? Well, it had something to do with it, but everything kind of broke multiple times. So we
[6739.26s -> 6747.78s]  just skipped all the we skipped all the lore just to get into the video game. It was significant
[6747.78s -> 6758.15s]  lore here. Oh, shit. They're almost here. Once you go all the way around, then you just go.
[6759.43s -> 6772.50s]  Here you go. That sucks. Wow. That sucks. Yeah, that's so funny. Look at how many people are
[6772.50s -> 6777.14s]  just waiting at the bottom waiting for someone to beat it. These guys are just hanging out.
[6777.14s -> 6784.52s]  This might as well just be mine con. Everybody's in diamond armor has diamond swords just walking
[6784.52s -> 6797.02s]  around. There are people that are really trying to there's a significant amount of people that
[6797.02s -> 6802.46s]  are attempting the first part and some of them are just kind of like walking into each other
[6802.46s -> 6816.79s]  and walking around. This person trying to fuck it up for everybody else. Are you the guy that's
[6816.79s -> 6831.46s]  from Boston that beat Dark Souls three on stream? I hope not. I am sorry to say mental anguish from
[6831.46s -> 6837.94s]  the queue. I wish there was something I could do about it, but I cannot do anything about it.
[6837.94s -> 6845.67s]  All I can hope is that maybe they can figure out what's the problem is. I am just I am just
[6845.67s -> 6857.94s]  participating. I am just participating with you all. Apparently there are thousands and
[6857.94s -> 6862.94s]  thousands of people that are like trying to do it and that's that's fine that that should work.
[6863.50s -> 6868.36s]  But the problem is is when we changed it from 400 to 250 it fucked up all the stuff in the
[6868.36s -> 6874.79s]  server. So they're trying to figure it out. A true king would have freed us by now. I can't.
[6875.90s -> 6884.36s]  I'm king in name only. Understand? What's what's that movie? Isn't there like what's the
[6884.68s -> 6890.60s]  movie about a guy that's not like this? That's not a real guy. He's like he's not the real
[6890.60s -> 6912.76s]  fuck the king. He's the useless king. Worst king puppet king. This is why you should do practice
[6912.76s -> 6928.74s]  streams. We did many of them just don't know Shrek 40 incoming. The discord is absolutely
[6928.74s -> 6937.13s]  mauled right now. I don't even want to go over there. It's like going home with a bad report
[6937.13s -> 6949.13s]  card. I don't want to go in there. I'm going to go to my friend Dave's house for like an hour.
[6949.13s -> 6954.97s]  Hey son are you coming home to show your report card? Yeah yeah um yeah I will.
[6956.55s -> 6961.03s]  Dave do you have this exact black ink that matches the report card so I can change
[6961.91s -> 6969.78s]  this uh this this to a B? I I was gonna put a line through the D. We need to make it a perfect B.
[6976.82s -> 6997.00s]  Somebody making progress. Did he do it? He did it! New king. No he gets an item. He gets the golden
[6997.00s -> 7015.62s]  boots of the golden boots of Ratatouille stream incoming. Keep those on. No nice work. Let's go!
[7015.62s -> 7028.98s]  I actually know what one of the mazes is and if everyone's gonna fucking flip out I everyone's
[7028.98s -> 7033.90s]  gonna lose their minds. In fact if we should probably just skip it because people are gonna
[7033.90s -> 7038.30s]  get very very mad at me for having it. They're gonna be very upset with me. I'm gonna get screamed
[7038.30s -> 7051.96s]  at. Shoot into the peasants. How am I listening to you? So many arrows here. All right are we
[7051.96s -> 7063.53s]  moving on to the next one? Flab with a guy that makes poops go. Let's go. I do that. That's me.
[7064.09s -> 7085.03s]  Is this the entrance? Can we knock it through this? Oh there we go. Oh yeah. Dude mace free Pog. Mace
[7085.03s -> 7110.79s]  free Pog. Pog mace. Pog mace found it. This is so fake. I'm gonna just find the entrance. I'm gonna
[7110.79s -> 7120.36s]  find the exit real quick. How many more rooms are there? I think there's only like like what five
[7120.36s -> 7147.72s]  more rooms or something. You're my I am sad. Okay let's go. Get in here. By the way this is a three
[7147.72s -> 7154.52s]  level maze. There's staircases between each maze. This is three tier. This is a three tiered cake
[7154.52s -> 7160.97s]  maze. This is the hard one and don't worry if nobody figures it out in the next 30 to 60 seconds
[7160.97s -> 7164.97s]  I'm cutting through the bottom of the cake and I'm gonna pop out like a fucking birthday party.
[7165.69s -> 7178.09s]  You're just torturing his fans. I keep like laughing too much today. I'm gonna be in pain.
[7182.15s -> 7196.14s]  Just like torture people. It's so funny. It's just you guys have just roasted me right now and it's
[7196.14s -> 7209.50s]  fucking hilarious dude. This is considered cruel and unusual punishment. Wait how people are actually
[7209.50s -> 7227.06s]  getting up top? They shouldn't be able to do that right? You can get up. This is a great view though.
[7227.06s -> 7230.82s]  This is what a scientist feels like when he looks down. When he's like the mouse and the cheese and
[7230.82s -> 7243.10s]  shit. Outplayed. Where's the staircase? Would you ever make a goo to cheese review? Yeah I'll do it
[7243.10s -> 7259.51s]  right now. That's all right. We are about rats in a maze. Actually did this yeah being just an
[7259.51s -> 7268.65s]  observer is much better. I can just see people progress. Maze experiment. This is a Stanford
[7269.53s -> 7276.76s]  I just puked. Stanford maze experiment. Somebody already got to it. Somebody made it up to the
[7276.76s -> 7288.23s]  next tier already. This one even that this one's not that bad. Oh he's trying to see where the
[7288.23s -> 7305.93s]  staircase is. I have like god mode. I can't even see where it is. Ah okay I gotta settle down.
[7306.87s -> 7313.96s]  The like cruel torture of your viewers. Like forcing you to do a bunch of gigantic mazes and
[7313.96s -> 7327.54s]  shit like that. It's just torturing everybody. When do you release the creepers? Yeah I feel
[7327.54s -> 7335.34s]  like I should be the AI director. Why are there holes in the ground? Oh my god that's evil.
[7337.11s -> 7340.63s]  Shit that's fucking evil because then you have to do the whole thing in the bottom again.
[7340.63s -> 7354.09s]  Oh my goodness that's evil. Is this Star Wars music? I don't think so. I think it's copyright
[7354.09s -> 7369.30s]  free. Oh there it is over here. So there's one there's another layer up top. So somebody
[7369.86s -> 7375.67s]  got somebody's already at the top. This did not take as long as it. Why is this one taking so
[7375.67s -> 7383.00s]  few amount of time? But the other ones were so much harder. Oh right because you could peek.
[7383.00s -> 7389.32s]  Oh right right right right right. Guys I promise you there's only one more maze and it's the worst
[7389.32s -> 7396.15s]  one. And this it is going to be it's going to be horrendous. I've seen it already. There's only one
[7396.15s -> 7411.42s]  more maze. So it's um it's absurd. You guys are going to lose your mind. It gets it's going to be
[7411.42s -> 7431.75s]  worse. Yes way worse. You don't even know. Way worse. Way more difficult. Oh there's no cheating
[7431.75s -> 7450.92s]  on level three. We're losing consciousness. So realm of the mad king. Yeah oh shit I have my

[8408.68s -> 8415.54s]  stream. I've been laughing at like just the roast job. Every time I look over a chat there's like a
[8415.54s -> 8437.50s]  new like top of our roast me comment. He's a redditor. Yeah you all you all redditors too.

[8508.95s -> 8535.05s]  the stream? He knows what it is. Would you be upset if a cow fell through your ceiling?
[8535.05s -> 8538.41s]  Yeah that would be horrible. That would be a terrible thing to have happen. What are you
[8538.41s -> 8558.84s]  talking about? If a cow fell through the ceiling right now that would be a disaster.
[8558.84s -> 8587.77s]  All right we got somebody's close. Don't look up. Where's the closest person? I think I would die.
[8587.77s -> 8593.74s]  Yeah you mean you would. If a cow landed through the ceiling on top of you. You're sitting at your
[8593.74s -> 8597.26s]  chair. You're dead. You're going to instantly die. It's gonna break every bone in your body.
[8597.26s -> 8608.82s]  Aren't cows like 700 pounds? A cow is like a thousand pounds. That's like half a car dropping
[8608.82s -> 8625.45s]  on your head. They did it. See you guys are actually good at this. Some of you guys can
[8625.45s -> 8635.61s]  actually do this shit really really well. 1400 pounds. That's a car man. That's a small car.
[8635.61s -> 8644.90s]  That's one of those gerbil cars. Is it called the key of gerbil? What's the song name? I actually
[8644.90s -> 8654.23s]  don't know. Congratulations to those of you that went through. Clueless sniper. Nice job.
[8663.50s -> 8674.46s]  All right let's move on to the next encounter. We're about to enter the one of the final rooms.
[8680.66s -> 8690.02s]  Serious Sam. Fuck I want to play Serious Sam too. Yeah we can go. Where is the actual end?
[8690.82s -> 8700.15s]  Okay I still can't. I'm flying around. I can't find the end. I have no idea where the end is
[8700.15s -> 8711.59s]  and I can fly through a building. Oh there we go. All right here's here we go. Time for
[8711.59s -> 8719.67s]  this is the final boss. The two yetis. Oh fuck these guys actually look like they're attacking.
[8720.95s -> 8725.03s]  Yeah this is actually dangerous I think. I think people are going to die here.
[8725.03s -> 8741.35s]  What the fuck was that? All right I'm turning off my god mode. I want to get in. I thought that was
[8741.35s -> 8762.26s]  in the game and I just freaked out. Another raid boss. This is the last raid boss. Did this share
[8762.26s -> 8780.39s]  health? Cod zombies. Why is somebody just jumping in my camera? Get out of here.
[8784.50s -> 8800.90s]  I have a diamond sword don't I? Somewhere. Where the hell is it? Focus one at a time.
[8804.22s -> 8829.59s]  We're splitting our damage up. Kill one at a time. I need a weapon. Where the fuck is the
[8829.59s -> 8846.07s]  healer? Let's see if I have any. Yeah we go. Oh shit. Wait what happened? I just had it.
[8846.07s -> 8857.86s]  It turned into a bow. Oh there we go. All right I got my I got my I got my weapon back.
[8865.11s -> 8869.67s]  This really is just recess. This is what I would feel like. This is what recess is like.
[8870.39s -> 8876.18s]  I get it now. I know what it's like to be a teacher. This is just outdoor recess.
[8880.95s -> 8896.22s]  Just replace the bows with little balls or nerf balls. No tanks all dps. I can't even hurt this
[8896.22s -> 8916.87s]  guy like this. One chat walking around beating everybody up. Where is the bad guy? All dps.
[8917.51s -> 8931.06s]  One of them has two hearts down. What the hell kind of school did Jeremy go to? No I'm not I'm
[8931.06s -> 8941.18s]  just I'm not saying it's like an all-out brawl outside. Kids like throwing rocks at each other
[8941.18s -> 8947.53s]  and biting each other and punch all of them while punching each other. Yeah that would be really
[8947.53s -> 8957.75s]  kind of a fucked up place to be. You're right. The amount of people just looking and waiting and
[8957.75s -> 8975.22s]  watching is so funny. Bones? Brawl? All right how much health does he have left? He's not even
[8975.22s -> 8988.52s]  rendering on my screen. Anybody else feel like that some of these clips can be taken to make it
[8988.52s -> 8999.78s]  seem like your Minecraft clan is really fucking cool? You'll take some of these with the music
[8999.78s -> 9013.53s]  in the background and look at this. This is like clan chaos. Don't fuck with us. We're clan carnage.
[9013.53s -> 9030.09s]  We don't fuck around at all. We're just really really really just not intimidating at all.
[9034.49s -> 9042.62s]  Clan cringe? Okay I'm gonna start lightning this fucking guy. I'm gonna I'm taking 10 health bars
[9042.62s -> 9061.35s]  down right now. Where is he? This dude only has two hearts and they would be really close to the
[9061.35s -> 9086.04s]  microphone. Sign up on our website clancarnage.com if you think you have what it takes. Wait I can type
[9086.04s -> 9092.98s]  what? This is not gonna kill. If I type slash does that kill everybody if I do slash kill?
[9093.86s -> 9100.58s]  Can I get confirmed what that does? What happens if I do slash kill?
[9102.79s -> 9117.83s]  Yeah yeah it would be a wordpress or vlog spot. That's true. Clan carnage accepting applications
[9117.83s -> 9131.77s]  now. Only kill mobs? All right can I can I can I can I get a manual kill on this guy?
[9131.77s -> 9145.08s]  How come I can't even see him? Why am I still in my own game? I feel like I'm not even here.
[9145.88s -> 9159.51s]  Yeah why is my lightning stick not killing anything? He's gone invisible. Oh it works on
[9159.51s -> 9175.19s]  players only okay. Remember you never existed. Oh did I get him? Did I actually hit him with
[9175.19s -> 9219.99s]  something? Clan carnage. Oh shit what did we kill it? Did we win? Fist of the sword. Whoa!
[9225.90s -> 9231.34s]  Oh my god people are dying. People are dying! What do we do? What do we do? What's going on?
[9231.34s -> 9253.77s]  Did somebody put like a kill block here? How do I move them? Is he dead? Oh they're being
[9253.77s -> 9263.59s]  tele-frag. 500 people on one block is gonna tele-frag if it happens. Dude I can't even see.
[9263.59s -> 9266.63s]  I'm just getting colors. It looks like the beginning of the stream. It looks like the
[9266.63s -> 9285.58s]  structure that they made. That work? Stuck on a block with somebody. Yeah one of these blocks
[9285.58s -> 9294.54s]  dumb. I'm at times 10 speed right now. All right I have this dragon sword. Am I gonna go kill this
[9294.54s -> 9308.71s]  dragon? All right guys it's time for the end. It's time for the end of recess. Hopefully the
[9308.71s -> 9317.40s]  bell doesn't ring before we go pretend to kill the dragon. All of a sudden it's gonna be like
[9319.77s -> 9333.56s]  about to kill the dragon. Come on in you little bastards. No we're not done with the dragon.
[9334.38s -> 9350.12s]  You had the fucking dragon. Yeah oh I died. Now get the fucking class. Uh okay. Dragon coming?
[9354.14s -> 9361.53s]  The dragon. Oh whoa oh boy we got extra time at recess. The principal came out. Hey kids
[9363.10s -> 9369.02s]  it's me the principal. I know that you guys wanted to play some more outside and frankly
[9369.02s -> 9379.90s]  I need another 20 minutes in my office. Recess has been extended by 10 minutes. Go have fun with
[9379.90s -> 9387.27s]  you and slay whatever dragon you want. That's right remember me and tell your parents to vote
[9387.27s -> 9394.79s]  for me. I'm running for selectman too next year. Don't tell them that principal Danny Davidson
[9394.79s -> 9402.04s]  only even have an extra 15 minutes at recess. Yeah by the way I'm getting rid of taxes in this

[9439.16s -> 9443.54s]  They're killing each other. Where did this one come from?
[9447.69s -> 9454.25s]  Now get off me. One of the cafeteria ladies jumped on me. You can't give them extra time outside.
[9454.25s -> 9462.76s]  They need to learn. Get off. Now kids don't worry I'll take care of this. Oh shit he's throwing
[9462.76s -> 9491.00s]  trees at me. You idiot. Get back in class and remember it's mystery meat today.

[9508.55s -> 9510.95s]  I made an extra sloppy for you.
[9513.67s -> 9517.59s]  Oh I know how you kids like a sloppy.
[9519.99s -> 9539.70s]  We got her. We got him. We did it. We killed the dragon. Hey and let me get off here and say
[9539.70s -> 9555.82s]  let it be known that kids now rule the school. No more nap times. No more math homework.
[9557.66s -> 9566.26s]  We run the school. Recess all day and french fries only for lunch.
[9575.96s -> 9580.36s]  Kids come on in. It's time for recess to be over. It's me principal Davidson.
[9580.36s -> 9587.02s]  Just a regular person. Not anything weird going on. I'm just normal. Oh what the heck.
[9587.66s -> 9591.32s]  Okay yeah it's gone. I've got to go. I've got to go into school now.
[9599.27s -> 9606.86s]  For the kindergarten. This structure is perfect for the kindergarten by the way.
[9606.86s -> 9614.18s]  This is just kindergarten scream. This was just this was keep. Oh we went to we went
[9614.18s -> 9621.66s]  to kindergarten school. This was just the plot of Billy Madison. Here go build something with

[9637.69s -> 9643.94s]  Pretend somebody's a skeleton king. This is what you this is what you built. This is this is what
[9643.94s -> 9657.46s]  would be built in a kindergarten class. How is that the plot for Billy Madison? It isn't. I don't
[9657.46s -> 9667.40s]  know. It's close. Kindergarten stream. This is so. How long did I think this was ever gonna work?
[9667.40s -> 9683.32s]  Like honest to god. Turn pvp on by the way and give me that skyrim music. The stream was just
[9683.32s -> 9697.02s]  a daycare. Recess versus reality. Should it that should be the title of this of this stream.
[9697.02s -> 9730.31s]  Recess versus reality. We got pvp on. Change title. I missed my son's birth list. Hey Nintendo
[9730.31s -> 9739.30s]  Wii music you know what that means. That means wait for the 2.4 gigahertz connection which is
[9739.30s -> 9748.06s]  like actually ends up being on the Wii like like 400k down. Download and update for your system or
[9748.06s -> 9755.90s]  to download a game that you know is like 40 megabytes and it's taking like 45 minutes and
[9755.90s -> 9763.19s]  then they decide you get Mario starts to walk by and hit coins with his head and when he gets
[9763.19s -> 9769.56s]  to the second box with the coins in it that means you're at 50 percent downloaded and then when you
[9769.56s -> 9775.88s]  get to about 75 percent downloaded he spams the last coin box until you turn the fucking volume
[9775.88s -> 9788.01s]  down on your tv. Can't just have a bar there that says 10 20 30 percent. I'm acting like this is
[9788.01s -> 9822.14s]  happening now. That's not currently happening right now. Pvp on. That guy's gone. Wait is he?
[9822.14s -> 9834.33s]  Murderer? Murderer? What the fuck? What? You ever visit your kingdom? Yeah you know what let's take

[9846.87s -> 9856.10s]  This guy person has a fort up here. Oh no what I just did okay what I just did is the equivalent
[9856.10s -> 9861.86s]  of like the dad or like the principal or like the other teacher coming out and seeing oh look
[9861.86s -> 9864.82s]  they're doing a little they're doing a little session where they're pretending to slay the
[9864.82s -> 9870.26s]  dragon and they're using sticks and pretending they're wands. See in those kids heads they have
[9870.26s -> 9875.72s]  their own headcanon how those wands work. If I walk out here with a wand in my hand as like
