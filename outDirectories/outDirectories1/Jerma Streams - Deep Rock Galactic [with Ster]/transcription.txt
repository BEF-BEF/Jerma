[0.82s -> 10.74s]  Hey, how's everybody doing? Early today. Very early. I wasn't anticipating being this early, but
[12.92s -> 23.27s]  sometimes things happen and you have to solve them. Uh, Otto has an appointment today. He has some
[23.27s -> 30.39s]  like kind of weird skin itching issues and it's getting to the point where it's been like a
[30.39s -> 35.43s]  couple days and I really I gotta get him in to get seen. So he's okay. He's fine. There's
[35.43s -> 40.15s]  nothing wrong with him. He's just, I don't know if it's the dry Vegas air or something or the
[40.15s -> 45.99s]  Vegas weather or something, but he needs to, I gotta get him checked out. So, um, gonna start
[45.99s -> 51.51s]  early. Stream for about five hours or so. Me and Ster are gonna play Deep Rock Galactic.
[52.47s -> 58.76s]  It is a left for dead Minecraft game. That's right. It's a lot. I don't know what this
[58.76s -> 63.00s]  game actually is. I did the tutorial and we're in a lobby together right now. Uh,
[63.00s -> 69.78s]  italics may join us in like an hour or so and we'll go for about four or five hours and then
[69.78s -> 74.52s]  I gotta take Otto to the vet and then tomorrow we're gonna do the movies. So you'll see the
[74.52s -> 85.05s]  movies tomorrow. Hopefully with some, uh, mods installed and that's the plan. So let me see if
[85.05s -> 104.36s]  he's, uh, here. You there? I'm not sure if he's around yet. Hey, I don't, I really don't
[104.36s -> 116.87s]  want to raise my voice. I will if I have to. I think he's got me muted. Let me move
[116.87s -> 126.92s]  this out of the way. Okay. Hey look. So this is, uh, Deep Rock Galactic. This is the
[128.36s -> 145.38s]  lobby system and there is, um, let's see if we can get his attention. How do I, like,
[145.38s -> 168.94s]  how do I get his attention? Did I just spit on him? Oh, hello. Hey there. Yeah, I'm here.
[168.94s -> 173.59s]  Hey, sorry. I was trying to, like, get your attention. Oh, I accidentally had to turn down.
[175.80s -> 183.05s]  Well, that was kind of funny. Um, so what, what's the, uh, where do we go? What's the
[183.05s -> 192.49s]  plan? I think you might be lagging a little. Yeah, I'm lagging. Uh, you go to the mission
[192.49s -> 199.34s]  terminal. Yeah. And you select the mission. Well, you're the party leader so I think you
[199.34s -> 204.36s]  should do it first. Because I really don't, I don't know how, like, where to go.
[205.16s -> 213.21s]  I mean, either. I haven't played in a while. Yeah. Um, what's that? That looks like a,
[213.21s -> 220.81s]  uh, looks like my old intro up there. That's pretty funny. Yeah. It's, like,
[221.69s -> 227.51s]  kind of funny. Yeah. What, so what, what's the first mission? What we
[230.07s -> 234.86s]  countdown? All right, come. We're doing the, uh, do you have to strap in?
[235.82s -> 249.72s]  Yeah, you gotta strap in. Remember seatbelt. He reminds you. Uh, pretty good game so far.
[253.62s -> 257.54s]  What was, sorry, I was panicking. What'd you say? I was just having, you know,
[258.42s -> 268.22s]  sorry. No, you, you talk first. I, I talk, what? Oh, wait, no, sorry. I thought I was
[268.22s -> 274.26s]  talking over you. All right. So I'm playing as the, um, I, I'm playing as the, what's this,
[274.26s -> 279.94s]  the driller? How do I get my drill out? And you try your, your one or your two or your three or
[279.94s -> 284.26s]  your four. So I can't explain how this game works because I can't really do that good of
[284.26s -> 295.69s]  a job explaining it so you can do it. Um, listen to him. That goes down pretty far.
[295.69s -> 300.01s]  You go down through the tunnels, you find the resources we need. So we've got to extract 200
[300.01s -> 304.65s]  more kite. You've got to collect 10 fossils. That's a, that's what we got to do. And then
[304.65s -> 309.93s]  you got to come run all the way back up to this spot before the ship leaves. All right. Nice.
[313.03s -> 319.00s]  And I'm the light guy. Also there's all damage and you don't want to, you don't want to take
[319.00s -> 325.90s]  that. And usually in the starting area, you know, you got a couple of things to mind.
[325.90s -> 333.43s]  That's our bot. You got to put the minerals in the bot. You know, not that pretty good.
[338.20s -> 339.80s]  Oops. I, or are you just hanging out here?
[349.86s -> 352.66s]  You're going to get out of it. Help me. You're going to get out of it. Help me. Come on.
[352.66s -> 363.34s]  It's German star again. Let's go. That's it. Last long. I can't, I can't do that. I can't,
[365.18s -> 369.74s]  I can't. I'm sorry. That's not going to happen. We agreed to try and sound as boring
[369.74s -> 375.86s]  as possible and see how long we could do it, but there was a cliff. Hey, hey, hey,
[375.86s -> 381.54s]  turn around tutorial. I don't even know how to play the game. I'm teaching you. This is the,
[381.54s -> 386.74s]  this is the fossil. That's awesome. We need 10 of those. Why don't I get my little, uh,
[386.74s -> 390.66s]  bot? Oh, well I have to do, we don't have the bot, the bot is single player. So it's,
[390.66s -> 396.10s]  it's up to us. It's up to us. Well, I've got a flame thrower. That's pretty cool. How
[396.10s -> 401.30s]  do I get my, um, Ooh, I got my drill arms. How do I? Okay. I'm not, I'm not,
[401.30s -> 404.10s]  I'm actually not trying to fall on purpose. Like what's my travel ability?
[406.44s -> 411.48s]  I don't think the drill guy has one, but you can, you, you ever played red faction?
[412.44s -> 419.05s]  Yeah. That's what we're talking about. You just drill up and down. Oh, okay. That's somewhere.
[419.77s -> 424.01s]  If we had more people, like if we had any friends whatsoever, if I didn't like break
[424.01s -> 429.29s]  all ties with everybody and we would have other people be able to join us, then there's like a
[429.29s -> 436.63s]  zip line guy. Yeah. It's just too bad you've burnt every bridge you've ever had in your
[436.63s -> 442.15s]  life. Like we would maybe have some friends over there. That's health. So if you ever hurt
[442.15s -> 449.35s]  and you need health, that's what health is. Okay. So I need that now. All right. I'm not,
[449.35s -> 454.23s]  can I be honest with you for a second? That like wicked loud fake laugh that I did,
[454.23s -> 463.83s]  like I hurt myself. I wait, what was that? I have you. I've captured you.
[463.83s -> 468.71s]  I thought that was you doing that. No, that was a very good impression. Wait,
[468.71s -> 471.27s]  wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? You, why do you have me doing that?
[471.91s -> 475.35s]  Well, I'll see. I'm a soul taker now. That's what I do. Whenever I play with people is I,
[475.35s -> 477.43s]  I take their souls through voice clips.
[487.45s -> 490.81s]  That's gonna, I, that's not going to get old. No way. All right. Let's get this.
[493.93s -> 498.17s]  I wish I could just play that. I thought you were just playing back a clip of you laughing.
[498.73s -> 508.47s]  Oh, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't use your drill on those. You just, you hold down space,
[508.47s -> 513.83s]  the mail. I space. Oh, no, nobody's a weirdo like you that has like fucking space bar.
[514.95s -> 519.83s]  Hey, watch out for the crystals. What they shoot lightning. Don't hit them.
[519.83s -> 525.19s]  Don't wait. Are you serious? You just avoid these. Just don't look at, don't look,
[525.19s -> 528.15s]  don't look, don't look. It's like the thing in the Minecraft. You don't look at it.
[528.95s -> 533.37s]  Otherwise it comes for you. I'm still freaking out by the fact that you have this like
[534.33s -> 541.66s]  the strange robot device that can capture me. That's not going to get old.
[543.70s -> 547.62s]  That's what I'm be saying. That I didn't say that he had, you know what? Like,
[547.62s -> 551.30s]  can I just, can I just say a couple of things and you just like, I'll just like play and
[551.30s -> 556.98s]  you can just like do a commentary. Okay. Okay. Give me the, I need them separately. Give me
[556.98s -> 564.81s]  an affirmative, like a yes. You got it. Okay. Now give me a negative. Nope.
[567.21s -> 574.84s]  You're not too sure anymore. Well, I don't get it. And I don't know anything you want.
[575.85s -> 582.81s]  Dude over here. Okay. That one is amazing. You can use that one at any time.
[583.85s -> 587.53s]  And hold on. I got the super light gun. Oh, wait, wrong, wrong one.
[588.49s -> 609.82s]  You can, you can, you can have like, I do. I'd be careful. Oh, I figured what the button is,
[609.82s -> 617.14s]  but the button to call the, the guy over to you is pretty important. Also this nitrate,
[617.14s -> 622.26s]  very important. We're going to need it. I'm sorry. I cannot pay attention right now.
[623.30s -> 634.66s]  You're a little bit distracted. I'm still freaking out. You just been waiting for
[634.66s -> 640.31s]  an opportunity to use this. I love how the, Hey, let's be quiet and not like make any references
[640.31s -> 646.95s]  or any jokes at all. The entire stream lasted five minutes and now I'm going to make Jerva say
[646.95s -> 655.11s]  fucking crazy shit over himself is now the new thing. So what? Okay. We need to extract
[655.11s -> 659.21s]  more kite. More kind. Yeah. That's what we're looking for. It's the light blue.
[659.93s -> 667.13s]  So should I keep throwing out these, um, yeah, he's pop. You have a whole bunch of
[667.13s -> 671.05s]  them and we're going to need to come back later. And then you can, you can, they stay on the ground
[671.05s -> 675.29s]  forever. Wait, I got this. They turn off so you can like follow where you've been.
[676.33s -> 686.38s]  Oh, yeah. Drill it baby. Up or down. Um, you got it. No, I thought I just said that.
[687.51s -> 690.55s]  I didn't say that. You thought that you said that, but you didn't say that. Yes. I thought
[690.55s -> 694.23s]  I just said that, but I didn't. I just heard myself say that. Which way do we go? Up or
[694.23s -> 711.83s]  down? We go, uh, we go straight. Okay. What about this, uh, egg sack? Try torch the egg sack. Um,
[711.83s -> 721.30s]  watch it. I don't know what these are actually. So the difficulties, what about the slugs?
[721.94s -> 726.60s]  I thought that was, I thought that was me as well. I thought that you just see that
[726.60s -> 729.96s]  your character yelling. That was me. You're freaking me out. Well, that's no, that's not
[730.04s -> 739.05s]  you. Okay. That's not you. Okay. I think I thought you like pitch shifted. Do you have
[739.05s -> 744.74s]  any mineral? Do I have any minerals? Yeah, I have some. Where, what do I see? I just
[744.74s -> 750.97s]  went through the ground. Where's my mineral count at the bottom of your screen? If you've
[750.97s -> 755.70s]  picked up anything, you got, you got to dump it in there. I don't have anything. Okay. You
[755.70s -> 763.35s]  have nothing. Okay. We're good. Okay. So, uh, up or down, up or down straight down. Okay.
[765.03s -> 772.90s]  This is more kite. Oh, here we go. So should I not be control clicking on this at all?
[774.42s -> 778.42s]  Uh, no, that doesn't collect it. And then we got, we got swarm incoming,
[778.42s -> 782.26s]  incoming swarm. You got it. No, I, why am I saying you got it? That's like the
[782.26s -> 792.71s]  me fake me saying that dude over here. So is there something I should be doing? Um,
[792.71s -> 795.27s]  we're just, we're just in a corner here. You know how, you know, left or dead,
[795.27s -> 798.87s]  the zombies all rush you. We're getting ready. We're bracing for impact.
[799.83s -> 810.22s]  What am I, what are my grenades? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You're
[810.22s -> 817.24s]  gonna have to throw one. So somebody clip that somebody clip him saying that right now. I gotta
[817.24s -> 820.52s]  do my own version of it. Get somebody clip him saying that and get, and give it to me.
[821.24s -> 840.62s]  Wait, which way? You got it. You got it. Up or down? I don't know. This is not a really
[840.62s -> 852.87s]  big swarm. This is like three. Up or down? Up or down? Is it friendly fire? Uh, yes,
[852.87s -> 856.39s]  I think it depends on difficulty. We're, we're just doing like a simple mission right now.
[856.39s -> 859.51s]  You know, just, you know, get our bearings. Yeah. Oh, now, now we got brought.
[863.37s -> 866.41s]  My grenades are like a slow field. Let's see what mine do.
[868.76s -> 873.80s]  I think you might have like the TNT big explosion. Uh, that's not exploding. It's an
[873.80s -> 879.08s]  axe. Oh, you have an axe. Well, they just had like a, uh, an update as well to what
[879.08s -> 894.26s]  grenades do. Pretty, pretty sick. Out of ammo. Flip that dickhead. That was really mean. Like,
[894.26s -> 898.90s]  it was like rude. I wasn't sure if that was you saying that or me making you say that.
[901.96s -> 910.81s]  What do we do about this? It's like roly poly. Uh, what is that? What the hell? I
[910.81s -> 915.21s]  have no idea. I've never seen it before. This thing's huge. Get it right in his teeth.
[915.85s -> 926.22s]  It's a brain bug. It kind of is a brain bug. You got it.
[932.49s -> 937.75s]  Um, this is okay. They probably warned us about this at some point, like 50 years ago.
[939.83s -> 944.23s]  Right now I'm like laughing at not me. I'm laughing at myself,
[944.23s -> 947.75s]  but it's not even me, but it was me earlier. I'm going to die. No, I'm not.
[952.47s -> 957.83s]  How are you, how are you doing that? What? I dug into the wall so I could stand in it.
[958.55s -> 968.82s]  I thought you said I could drill up. Whoa. Okay. That was fucking scary.
[969.86s -> 977.80s]  Well, you got, you got to drill like, uh, that was diagonal up. I mean, I was,
[977.80s -> 982.52s]  I thought I was doing that. Oh, like worms, fossils, fossils. We got fossils.
[983.16s -> 992.14s]  So let me test this out. So you're talking about like worms. So if I go like this,
[992.70s -> 1003.86s]  what about you? Yeah. You can make like this. Cool. Um, I forgot the button. Hey,
[1003.86s -> 1009.14s]  hey, anybody here from Twitch chat? I need the mule right here. How do I,
[1009.14s -> 1020.12s]  I got to check the button. What do you need? We need to call in a supply drop for more ammo.
[1020.76s -> 1024.52s]  I forget the button. Uh, five. How do I know that? And you don't.
[1024.52s -> 1028.20s]  Yeah. How do you know that? Cause you just did the tutorial. See, I got, I can do it.
[1028.76s -> 1039.30s]  Should I do it too? No, only one of us can do it. This is ammo, I'm assuming. And you need,
[1039.30s -> 1047.00s]  uh, nitrous for this or whatever it is. That, okay. That scared me too. And I knew it was
[1047.00s -> 1060.71s]  coming. Should I just take them each side? No, leave those. Leave them. We need to collect,
[1060.71s -> 1066.55s]  uh, you see this red mineral up here? The red one? Yeah. That's what allows us to call that
[1066.63s -> 1069.99s]  supply drop in. So we can't, we don't just have them forever. So you're talking about
[1069.99s -> 1075.27s]  like that, right? The thing I'm mining right now. Red sugar. Yeah. You need like 90 or 80 of
[1075.27s -> 1084.87s]  these. Okay. Well you can like fly around. I have to like walk. I have to like drill
[1084.87s -> 1092.49s]  through the sky. Well, I'm sorry. You picked the driller. Well, that's your, you,
[1092.49s -> 1097.05s]  you collect them. I'll just be the guy that like hangs out and just watches me. I'll just
[1097.45s -> 1103.18s]  play the game. Yeah. Okay. Well, you already get, you know, you're already going up. It's
[1103.18s -> 1114.30s]  straight. We're going this way. Okay. Isn't there a map? Oh, there's, uh, there's a
[1114.30s -> 1118.86s]  four over here. It's tab probably M behind you, dude. Yeah, but you can handle it.
[1119.58s -> 1128.98s]  I don't know. Can I? Yeah, you can handle it. Look, so we're, we almost got,
[1128.98s -> 1141.08s]  what do we need? 200? Yeah. So what about other minerals? Is there, are there rare
[1141.08s -> 1146.04s]  minerals? Like, holy shit, I see gold or something. There, there are. Um, if you see
[1146.04s -> 1149.56s]  a whole bunch of like circles in a wall, kind of, kind of like this, actually. You
[1149.56s -> 1154.36s]  see this over here and you see what's going on up there. So should I drill in
[1154.36s -> 1157.64s]  there? That means, uh, I'm pretty sure that's one of them. It looks a little
[1157.64s -> 1161.24s]  different. Usually inside the wall here. This is where you need drill guy to go
[1161.24s -> 1164.84s]  in there and drill up into that wall. Monster, uh, monster spawner in there.
[1164.84s -> 1174.17s]  Okay. I see more. I see more. Yeah. Just keep digging into the, the circle spot.
[1174.17s -> 1180.07s]  Okay. Until you find the pearl. It's like, find the pearl. Uh, and then
[1180.07s -> 1188.20s]  come back. It's like, it's over here. All right. Hey, have you found it yet?
[1188.20s -> 1193.06s]  I don't know. Now I'm just going to let you talk for me. How about now?
[1193.78s -> 1203.10s]  Nope. Keep looking. Maybe it's below. It's, you know, it's somewhere around
[1203.10s -> 1216.97s]  here. You think you're going around in circles around it? Come on, drill guy.
[1217.77s -> 1231.93s]  I don't know. Nope. That's all I've got. Nope. You don't have a yes or don't you
[1231.93s -> 1241.40s]  have a dude come here? I have, uh, up or down. Down. Up or down. Down. It's
[1241.40s -> 1249.74s]  right in front of me. How do I get it? Oh, oh, well then, um, I got it. Oh,
[1249.74s -> 1254.49s]  now we've got to bring it back to the mule. You got it. Where's the mule
[1254.49s -> 1263.83s]  from here? Can I throw this? It should be funny. It's straight down. Just go
[1263.83s -> 1271.30s]  for it. Did I just give you the EXP? Yeah. I got all the experience from
[1271.30s -> 1275.46s]  that. No, you didn't. You're not going to level ever. I don't know.
[1276.10s -> 1282.57s]  The thing is people know the truth because I come through clean and crisp
[1282.57s -> 1289.37s]  and that comes through like not clean and crisp. All right. So I'm
[1289.37s -> 1293.05s]  looking at the map right now. These are rare materials too. They are
[1293.13s -> 1305.24s]  they? Buys more. Buys more. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Point one buys more.
[1306.92s -> 1311.61s]  Yeah, you're going to need more than that. That's the fuel satellites
[1313.05s -> 1318.46s]  and the satellites. You can call, uh, call them down. Oh, that's
[1318.46s -> 1322.23s]  cool. All right. So what should we go from here? Let's open the map
[1322.23s -> 1334.52s]  that I knew about, but you didn't. Um, we go up, up or down,
[1336.90s -> 1342.23s]  up. Where are you? Well, I'm a loop bug over here. Is that like a
[1343.45s -> 1351.03s]  well, kill loop bug. Ooh. Where's my friend? I'm down. How can I
[1351.03s -> 1353.83s]  like tell you where I am? I'm like underneath you. I think there's
[1353.83s -> 1361.48s]  a yell button. Oh, there you are. Yes. Okay. Come on. Yeah. Let's
[1361.48s -> 1370.28s]  let's go like up, not down. I don't know. I mean, I can't
[1370.28s -> 1373.72s]  remember which one just went pretty good about it, but now I'm
[1373.72s -> 1377.48s]  so confused. What is that? That's not going to get all.
[1380.25s -> 1384.60s]  All right. Ooh, what's this? Gold. It's gold. We need gold.
[1387.98s -> 1393.99s]  This is very annoying without anyone that can like go up walls.
[1394.71s -> 1397.90s]  What's the, I mean, I think you're the only person that
[1397.90s -> 1403.48s]  can get that. Oh yeah. Don't worry. I've got it. So should
[1403.48s -> 1405.64s]  I, are you collecting it or should I go on the ground and
[1405.64s -> 1412.30s]  collect it? I'm collecting. Okay. Good. What does that? What
[1412.30s -> 1417.58s]  does that really cool new cyberpunk trailer music mean?
[1419.66s -> 1431.77s]  Swarm. I do like the flame effects though. They're very
[1431.77s -> 1440.22s]  cool. Over here. Over here. How difficult is that for you to
[1440.22s -> 1444.63s]  press that button? I do have to take my hand off my
[1444.63s -> 1447.75s]  mouse for a second. See, you should be focusing on the game
[1447.75s -> 1453.67s]  instead of your, how do you not have one? I screamed clipped
[1453.67s -> 1460.07s]  already. You still got these old, old material. There's a
[1460.07s -> 1463.43s]  huge bug. There's a huge bug gaping dragon over here.
[1467.82s -> 1484.17s]  Yeah. Where'd it go? Oh, there he is. There he is.
[1484.17s -> 1492.10s]  Behind you. This hurts. I don't know. I really don't know.
[1492.10s -> 1494.90s]  I don't have to leap them all because I don't remember which
[1494.90s -> 1500.55s]  one is which. There he is. There he is. Yeah. Keep that
[1500.55s -> 1503.03s]  one because they're here. There he is. There he is. There
[1503.03s -> 1505.75s]  he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. There he
[1505.75s -> 1514.06s]  is. There he is. Oh shit. That diamond just insta killed
[1514.06s -> 1522.06s]  him. I don't see him. Are you sure? Okay. I'm going
[1522.06s -> 1534.79s]  down. Fine. Fine. Does he drop anything or no? No. Is he
[1534.79s -> 1539.02s]  just cool? He's just a cool guy. Just cool. All right. I
[1539.02s -> 1544.38s]  need some of that red sugar to heal, right? Yeah. Where's
[1544.38s -> 1545.74s]  it? Where's it? It's kryptonite or something. Where's
[1545.74s -> 1553.78s]  it called? It's I don't know. Let's go up. Is it
[1553.78s -> 1556.50s]  like procedurally everything generated? Can we? Is it? Well,
[1556.50s -> 1559.38s]  do you have the map? What was the map button? Tab. Hold
[1559.46s -> 1563.88s]  tab. Tab. Well, yeah. If there was something up there,
[1563.88s -> 1565.80s]  you'd be able to see it on the map but yeah, you can just
[1565.80s -> 1569.56s]  like drill across or you want me to just go in here and
[1569.56s -> 1575.96s]  just drill. I'm gonna just go. Is this like Minecraft?
[1575.96s -> 1577.80s]  Should I not like ever drill what I don't know where
[1577.80s -> 1580.12s]  I'm drilling? Are we gonna fall into the lava? There's
[1580.12s -> 1585.32s]  no like bedrock or like a lava or anything. All right.
[1585.32s -> 1590.79s]  Well, we're just still going. Okay. I don't think
[1590.79s -> 1597.88s]  you're going anywhere. Am I not going anywhere? You
[1598.12s -> 1600.12s]  gotta look at the map. No, like look at where you
[1600.12s -> 1607.24s]  are like hold tab. Yeah. What about it? This is
[1607.24s -> 1610.84s]  not I like if you you rotate the map, you'd be
[1610.84s -> 1616.92s]  able to see a room but so what not going
[1616.92s -> 1622.97s]  anywhere. So, can I not have I not going anywhere
[1622.97s -> 1626.89s]  but why can I dig over here though? Why not? Well,
[1626.89s -> 1632.49s]  why what's what there's no secrets over here. You
[1632.49s -> 1634.97s]  know, you're the hardest person to record sound
[1634.97s -> 1637.77s]  bites for because like it doesn't start recording
[1637.77s -> 1641.75s]  until you start talking but you have like most of
[1641.75s -> 1644.95s]  the things you say are filler words. Well, why
[1644.95s -> 1649.96s]  what's what there's no secrets over here. Like
[1649.96s -> 1652.12s]  most people I can just get a straight like
[1652.12s -> 1656.12s]  there's no secrets over here. Not you.
[1657.56s -> 1664.07s]  Oh, big fun. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's
[1664.07s -> 1667.77s]  no secrets over here. Oh, what are we doing? Oh,
[1667.77s -> 1673.11s]  that is a big bug. Yeah, shoot them in the butt.
[1673.91s -> 1677.85s]  Oh, he dropped something. Am I not supposed to
[1677.85s -> 1681.29s]  be touching that? No, that's poison. But no,
[1681.29s -> 1684.01s]  there actually is like a globe in there. Wait,
[1684.01s -> 1687.27s]  come back this way. We're gonna keep drilling.
[1687.99s -> 1689.53s]  I thought you just told me that this was not
[1689.53s -> 1693.74s]  something I should be doing. Don't you want
[1693.74s -> 1696.65s]  to see what's that way? Wasn't the whole
[1696.65s -> 1699.61s]  point that I was stupid for doing this? Well,
[1713.61s -> 1716.01s]  what's what there's no secrets over here.
[1722.86s -> 1726.14s]  Am I not going anywhere? I don't understand.
[1726.78s -> 1732.06s]  Well, what's what there's no secrets over here.
[1741.21s -> 1742.17s]  Oh, he dropped something.
[1747.35s -> 1750.25s]  Hold on, look at the map. Am I not going
[1750.25s -> 1756.78s]  anywhere? Hold on. Should we turn around,
[1756.78s -> 1769.19s]  right? Is this not it? Right. So that doesn't
[1769.19s -> 1773.34s]  you can just do that for fun. No,
[1773.34s -> 1774.62s]  that's a serious business. Just wait till
[1774.62s -> 1776.70s]  they patch that out next patch. We found
[1776.70s -> 1782.07s]  an exploit. This just didn't. Miners can
[1782.07s -> 1785.93s]  mine in ground. We've removed it. We think
[1785.93s -> 1788.25s]  players had too much freedom. All right,
[1788.25s -> 1791.67s]  so you went down. Yeah, up or down?
[1794.44s -> 1795.64s]  Oh, yeah, we gotta go this. We haven't
[1795.64s -> 1797.08s]  gone this way. All right, cool.
[1800.52s -> 1810.25s]  Just like an actual one or health or health
[1810.25s -> 1818.25s]  over here. Health globes. Hey, I got some
[1818.81s -> 1819.93s]  one hundred and seventy five out of two
[1819.93s -> 1827.22s]  hundred. Just gonna keep going up. So
[1827.22s -> 1828.34s]  who's the best character in the game?
[1828.34s -> 1830.82s]  What's the coolest character? The coolest.
[1830.82s -> 1833.86s]  I really do like a drill guy. There's
[1833.86s -> 1836.26s]  one fun thing. Like after you collect
[1836.26s -> 1838.58s]  all the minerals, you have to retrace
[1838.58s -> 1840.02s]  your struts, your steps to get back up
[1840.02s -> 1842.66s]  to the starting spot, right? Or trace
[1842.66s -> 1844.90s]  your strep. The drill guy could just
[1844.90s -> 1846.58s]  drill like a straight line straight
[1846.58s -> 1849.70s]  back to it. Especially if you're on
[1849.70s -> 1851.06s]  like a harder level and that because
[1851.06s -> 1855.27s]  the levels get really huge. They seem
[1855.27s -> 1856.71s]  like they seem like they could get big.
[1857.43s -> 1858.87s]  Hey, you ever play this game called
[1858.87s -> 1862.39s]  Apex Legends? No, not once. OK, well
[1862.39s -> 1863.83s]  first of all, Apex Legends is better
[1863.83s -> 1866.47s]  than this game. And there's the
[1866.55s -> 1868.15s]  character Pathfinder and he has, you
[1868.15s -> 1870.07s]  know, ziplines. There's a zipline
[1870.07s -> 1871.03s]  character just like that.
[1871.99s -> 1874.47s]  Underneath you there's this health
[1874.47s -> 1876.15s]  underneath you. Like grab it right
[1876.15s -> 1877.67s]  underneath like with that rocket.
[1877.67s -> 1879.35s]  I'm not hurt. Straight below you.
[1879.35s -> 1882.84s]  This is health on her. Are you dead?
[1884.04s -> 1887.26s]  What? No. Are you dead right now?
[1887.26s -> 1890.70s]  Am I dead? No. Why? I'm mining over
[1890.70s -> 1893.32s]  here. You look like you're dead.
[1895.54s -> 1897.54s]  Dead? Like what happens when you die?
[1897.54s -> 1898.90s]  Can you can you be like revived or
[1898.90s -> 1902.44s]  what? Well, no, you just you're just
[1902.44s -> 1904.44s]  dead forever. What? Do you see a dead
[1904.44s -> 1907.51s]  body on the screen? Yeah, there's one
[1907.51s -> 1910.39s]  like right down this pit. What? I'm
[1910.39s -> 1913.67s]  like I'm like fucking over here mining
[1913.67s -> 1915.77s]  this red shit. You don't see me over
[1915.77s -> 1917.77s]  here. I'm pressing X. Do you see me
[1917.77s -> 1920.97s]  hitting the red thing? I got you.
[1920.97s -> 1924.36s]  What the fuck just happened? What the
[1924.36s -> 1926.60s]  fuck's going on? Why am I here?
[1926.60s -> 1928.90s]  Hey, there's health over here. You
[1928.90s -> 1930.66s]  just like ported me back. Am I
[1930.66s -> 1932.02s]  lagging? You just like ported me back.
[1932.02s -> 1933.78s]  I was like in a fucking wall.
[1933.78s -> 1940.10s]  Can you like teleport people to?
[1940.10s -> 1942.10s]  That's weird. Yeah, there's a I'm
[1942.10s -> 1943.30s]  playing teleport guy.
[1943.30s -> 1945.22s]  Oh, no, I just I got like pulled
[1945.22s -> 1948.42s]  back. That's weird.
[1948.42s -> 1949.78s]  I actually forget what the other guy
[1949.78s -> 1955.94s]  does. So we we
[1955.94s -> 1958.26s]  need to find fossils. We need to
[1958.26s -> 1959.62s]  find fossils. I think they actually
[1959.62s -> 1962.12s]  show up on the scanner too.
[1962.12s -> 1966.92s]  Do they? Let me go this way. I've
[1966.92s -> 1968.36s]  we've been messing around so much I
[1968.36s -> 1969.80s]  have no clue where we've been and
[1969.80s -> 1971.72s]  haven't been. And also like every 10
[1971.72s -> 1973.32s]  minutes my computer has been freaking
[1973.32s -> 1975.00s]  out and it just starts like freezing up
[1975.00s -> 1977.40s]  and I can't do anything about it.
[1977.40s -> 1982.79s]  I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not very
[1982.79s -> 1985.59s]  I don't like this character.
[1985.59s -> 1986.79s]  I want the character that can fly
[1986.79s -> 1988.07s]  around.
[1988.07s -> 1993.14s]  Well, I'm at crystals. Hey, there's a
[1993.14s -> 1994.58s]  lot of bugs.
[1994.58s -> 1999.14s]  I need your help. Where you at? I'm
[1999.14s -> 2000.58s]  worried. I think I'm going to die.
[2000.58s -> 2002.58s]  Hit, shout, shout, shout, shout. I
[2002.58s -> 2008.07s]  don't know where you are.
[2008.07s -> 2009.35s]  What happens if they hit me? What,
[2009.35s -> 2011.11s]  you see the audience screen?
[2011.11s -> 2013.26s]  Shout again. I can't see you. I don't
[2013.26s -> 2014.30s]  know where you are.
[2014.30s -> 2029.80s]  Watch out. I got this one. I got this.
[2029.80s -> 2031.16s]  Watch out.
[2031.16s -> 2039.10s]  Told you. What's the big circle here?
[2039.10s -> 2040.30s]  The big blue circle. That's what I was
[2040.30s -> 2041.26s]  talking about before. That's my
[2041.26s -> 2042.38s]  grenade.
[2042.38s -> 2044.38s]  That's a flow field. I can't see
[2044.38s -> 2045.50s]  anything.
[2045.50s -> 2054.30s]  Help me. Shit. I'm not gonna lie. I
[2054.30s -> 2055.02s]  have no clue.
[2055.02s -> 2060.58s]  Like I would not lie to you.
[2060.58s -> 2063.21s]  I mean you you have many times. We're
[2063.21s -> 2064.33s]  gonna run around
[2064.33s -> 2066.49s]  and and get the last fossils. We get
[2066.49s -> 2068.33s]  the heck out of here.
[2068.33s -> 2069.37s]  Yeah, well you're the one that made
[2069.37s -> 2070.81s]  this a comedy stream. We would
[2070.81s -> 2072.01s]  this is supposed to be a boring play
[2072.01s -> 2073.37s]  the game stream and you made it a
[2073.37s -> 2075.13s]  comedy stream by making like recording
[2075.13s -> 2076.65s]  me. Come over here. Without me
[2076.65s -> 2078.41s]  telling you you could.
[2078.41s -> 2079.21s]  I want to make sure you're aware of
[2079.21s -> 2081.69s]  that. I didn't sign any release form.
[2081.69s -> 2083.53s]  Tell me when I have permission to
[2083.53s -> 2084.97s]  record you.
[2084.97s -> 2087.85s]  Not now. You don't have permission
[2087.85s -> 2089.69s]  to record me right now.
[2089.69s -> 2094.14s]  Okay, I'm not. Okay, good. I would
[2094.14s -> 2095.42s]  hate to have to get legal involved
[2095.42s -> 2096.38s]  in this one.
[2096.38s -> 2100.42s]  I have a drill. Why would I be doing
[2100.42s -> 2105.98s]  this? I don't know. Have we probably
[2105.98s -> 2107.50s]  walked by
[2108.78s -> 2111.50s]  a ton of these? Is gold up here? I just
[2111.50s -> 2112.94s]  no, I just grabbed it.
[2112.94s -> 2117.56s]  So we're looking for the fossil
[2117.56s -> 2120.49s]  looking thing, right?
[2120.49s -> 2124.90s]  I'm out of ammo.
[2126.82s -> 2129.06s]  Mike, I'm out of uh shit. Sorry, I know
[2129.06s -> 2130.74s]  we don't like to use real names. Um
[2130.74s -> 2134.15s]  I'm out of uh ammo.
[2134.15s -> 2136.31s]  Please never say that again. I would
[2136.31s -> 2138.31s]  hate. Hate to have to get legal
[2138.31s -> 2141.64s]  involved in this one.
[2141.64s -> 2148.36s]  I need ammo. Uh what's that uh
[2148.36s -> 2149.48s]  supply thing or should I just drop
[2149.48s -> 2153.51s]  another one? I don't know if we can.
[2153.51s -> 2157.22s]  I don't see where those are. You need
[2157.22s -> 2159.54s]  like 80 nitra.
[2159.54s -> 2161.88s]  Is there something on the minimap or
[2161.88s -> 2162.76s]  something that indicates if there's a
[2162.76s -> 2164.12s]  fossil around?
[2164.12s -> 2167.35s]  Or like the scanner or something? Because
[2167.35s -> 2169.19s]  I'm just trying to find one too. I'm pretty sure.
[2169.19s -> 2173.82s]  Oh, we're like nowhere near each other
[2173.82s -> 2175.66s]  either. No, I'm just looking for
[2175.66s -> 2177.18s]  fossils. They have that weird
[2177.18s -> 2179.26s]  nautilus look to them, right?
[2179.26s -> 2182.38s]  Yeah. It's like the uh Pokemon.
[2182.38s -> 2185.10s]  You know Pokemon. I don't. Are you
[2185.10s -> 2186.54s]  excited for um
[2186.54s -> 2191.00s]  Pokemon, Blood and Gore? Oh. See mine was
[2191.00s -> 2194.76s]  like nice. Yours was mean and horrible.
[2194.76s -> 2198.84s]  Pokemon, Blood and Gore.
[2198.84s -> 2200.20s]  They're going with a more mature
[2200.20s -> 2202.04s]  route. They figured after a Detective
[2202.04s -> 2203.08s]  Pikachu,
[2203.08s -> 2204.60s]  like everyone who likes Pokemon is a
[2204.60s -> 2205.64s]  bit older now and it's time for
[2205.64s -> 2208.55s]  Pokemon Blood and Gore.
[2208.55s -> 2212.31s]  Uh Pokemon Sex and Drugs.
[2212.39s -> 2214.47s]  That's next. They're testing the waters
[2214.47s -> 2216.54s]  with Blood and Gore.
[2216.54s -> 2219.37s]  I'm going up. Okay, I think I have all
[2219.37s -> 2220.49s]  the fossils.
[2220.49s -> 2224.09s]  It says we have six out of ten. Yeah,
[2224.09s -> 2225.45s]  I'm carrying four.
[2225.45s -> 2231.78s]  Oh, you have four. Okay. Can you shout
[2231.78s -> 2233.11s]  for me?
[2233.11s -> 2235.43s]  I'm so far away. Yeah, you are really
[2235.43s -> 2237.61s]  far away.
[2237.61s -> 2238.81s]  You can start heading back to the
[2238.81s -> 2241.21s]  ship because once I can deposit this,
[2241.21s -> 2242.49s]  we're leaving.
[2242.49s -> 2244.57s]  Um the ship is. I called the mule to
[2244.57s -> 2246.25s]  me. The ship is just the thing that
[2246.25s -> 2247.13s]  looks like a ship
[2247.13s -> 2252.09s]  on the screen, right? Yeah, I think. Why
[2252.09s -> 2253.54s]  is it moving?
[2253.54s -> 2256.02s]  Why is it? Oh, no, no, that's the mule.
[2256.02s -> 2258.50s]  So where where's the ship? Where's the
[2258.50s -> 2259.94s]  ship? I'm gonna like leave you on this
[2259.94s -> 2260.82s]  planet.
[2260.82s -> 2263.14s]  Don't do that. This is about to be
[2263.14s -> 2264.42s]  really bad.
[2264.42s -> 2266.10s]  But where about where is the ship
[2266.10s -> 2267.46s]  from here?
[2267.46s -> 2271.93s]  Um is there on the. Is it on the
[2271.93s -> 2272.65s]  map? I think it's
[2272.65s -> 2274.33s]  way up on the map. You just need to
[2274.33s -> 2275.61s]  start going up.
[2275.61s -> 2278.33s]  It'll. I think it'll show you once
[2278.41s -> 2281.69s]  I complete the quest thingy. Okay. Normally,
[2281.69s -> 2284.44s]  you're meant to follow
[2284.44s -> 2286.76s]  the mule. All right, well um I'm just
[2286.76s -> 2288.28s]  gonna dig. I'm digging straight up.
[2288.28s -> 2294.38s]  Hopefully, I don't drown myself.
[2294.38s -> 2296.70s]  Mule has a button. Somebody said the
[2296.70s -> 2298.30s]  mule has a button.
[2298.30s -> 2299.50s]  Yeah, it has a button that I press
[2299.50s -> 2301.10s]  and then like the mission ends and
[2301.10s -> 2302.78s]  swarms all come after you.
[2302.78s -> 2303.74s]  Oh, and you have to get to the
[2303.74s -> 2307.67s]  exit. Because the bugs know that
[2307.67s -> 2308.95s]  you're leaving and they're like
[2308.95s -> 2315.74s]  bonely. I'm just making this harder.
[2315.74s -> 2317.50s]  I'm making this slower and harder by
[2317.50s -> 2319.58s]  just going through the a tunnel to the
[2319.58s -> 2320.06s]  left.
[2320.06s -> 2322.78s]  There's no reason to do this. I just
[2322.78s -> 2324.06s]  bought out guys. I don't
[2324.06s -> 2326.78s]  I'm making it harder. I am. I'm making
[2326.78s -> 2328.06s]  it harder. I just got it. I got it.
[2328.06s -> 2333.43s]  Got it. I gave it. I gave it.
[2333.43s -> 2336.39s]  Here it goes. I don't have any more fuel.
[2336.39s -> 2342.52s]  Got an axe. I'm about to be in deep
[2342.52s -> 2343.88s]  shit aren't I?
[2343.88s -> 2345.72s]  Oh okay. Now it shows you drop pod.
[2345.72s -> 2347.40s]  You see where that is? Drop pod.
[2347.40s -> 2349.16s]  That's actually not that far.
[2349.16s -> 2351.00s]  Okay, that's where you gotta go.
[2353.37s -> 2356.14s]  I'm out of fuel. How do I get fuel?
[2356.14s -> 2358.70s]  You need to resupply. You should be able
[2358.70s -> 2360.81s]  to call one now.
[2360.81s -> 2366.20s]  I don't have enough.
[2366.20s -> 2368.20s]  No, I can see it. I can see it. I can see it.
[2368.20s -> 2372.17s]  Okay. The other fun strat
[2372.17s -> 2375.37s]  when you call in the supplies
[2375.37s -> 2379.03s]  it drills from like the top down.
[2379.03s -> 2380.63s]  So if you call it underneath a
[2380.63s -> 2382.23s]  launch pod or something it just makes
[2382.23s -> 2383.59s]  a straight line up.
[2383.59s -> 2393.18s]  Yeah, I'm here. Okay, I'm on my way.
[2393.18s -> 2397.46s]  I see. You got some bugs behind you.
[2397.46s -> 2404.44s]  I am. I'm bugging out. What's this?
[2404.44s -> 2412.10s]  Oh, it's just a... My computer's on the fritz.
[2412.10s -> 2413.54s]  You look like your computer's having
[2413.54s -> 2418.42s]  trouble. Yeah.
[2418.42s -> 2420.02s]  So we this is just like left for day.
[2420.02s -> 2421.78s]  We just have to get on.
[2421.78s -> 2427.53s]  Yeah, I'm getting on it. There you go.
[2427.53s -> 2429.93s]  That was baby mission for babies.
[2429.93s -> 2431.29s]  That just looked like it said no
[2431.29s -> 2433.66s]  dwarfs.
[2433.66s -> 2439.70s]  No, it's no elves. Retrieving escape.
[2439.70s -> 2443.80s]  Oh, this is new.
[2443.80s -> 2446.04s]  Why do we do the Grand Theft Auto 5
[2446.04s -> 2448.04s]  lobby?
[2448.04s -> 2453.45s]  Shit. Oh, you win a race.
[2453.45s -> 2456.25s]  So Jadiz and Vizmoor.
[2456.25s -> 2458.33s]  Do we use these for stuff?
[2458.33s -> 2460.17s]  Oh yeah, I'll show you that now.
[2460.17s -> 2462.65s]  I'll show you what you use the Jadiz on.
[2462.65s -> 2469.70s]  Sick. Sick.
[2469.70s -> 2471.54s]  How many chins does the driller have?
[2471.54s -> 2478.42s]  A lot.
[2478.42s -> 2482.90s]  So I did perks. I did one already.
[2482.90s -> 2485.06s]  Oh yeah, come, come, come, come, come, come.
[2485.06s -> 2487.88s]  What's up? Where are you?
[2487.88s -> 2491.94s]  You come down here in these terminals
[2491.94s -> 2493.86s]  like equipment
[2493.86s -> 2495.70s]  and you can upgrade your equipment and
[2495.70s -> 2496.74s]  get new stuff.
[2496.74s -> 2499.86s]  Oh, this is cool. I think this one's
[2499.86s -> 2501.78s]  cosmetics. Yeah, this is all your
[2501.78s -> 2504.22s]  upgrades.
[2504.22s -> 2505.82s]  Locked weapon. So when you click on a
[2505.82s -> 2507.50s]  gun it has like tiers
[2507.50s -> 2509.50s]  where it goes down. You can only
[2509.50s -> 2512.06s]  have one perk equipped per tier.
[2512.06s -> 2513.82s]  And so I need to level your money.
[2513.82s -> 2515.58s]  You need to be, this is level four
[2515.58s -> 2522.73s]  for the next row. What's this like
[2522.73s -> 2524.41s]  four, eight, twelve, sixteen that goes
[2524.41s -> 2529.11s]  down? I don't know what you're talking
[2529.11s -> 2529.59s]  about.
[2529.59s -> 2531.03s]  When you're in the equipment, when you
[2531.03s -> 2532.79s]  open up a piece of equipment.
[2532.79s -> 2534.87s]  Right, like open up your equipment and
[2534.87s -> 2536.31s]  this should be
[2536.31s -> 2539.03s]  red. Oh yeah, you need to unlock
[2539.03s -> 2540.47s]  levels. Those are your levels that you
[2540.47s -> 2541.35s]  need to be.
[2541.35s -> 2542.95s]  So should I increase the range of
[2542.95s -> 2544.55s]  the flame for long distance
[2544.55s -> 2546.97s]  incineration?
[2546.97s -> 2548.73s]  How hard is it to come by some of
[2548.73s -> 2549.61s]  these materials?

[3067.10s -> 3068.10s]  45,000 K 20
[3068.34s -> 3072.86s]  I don't want to bet I don't want to be the guy League of Legends that fucking loads in last you look like an asshole
[3073.90s -> 3075.90s]  loads in last I
[3076.02s -> 3081.98s]  Don't want to be the little guy the League of Legends the fuck loads in last. I don't want to be that guy
[3082.60s -> 3086.54s]  All right, hold everybody hustle hustle
[3091.44s -> 3094.13s]  Okay, we need we got a salvage to you

[3111.69s -> 3115.63s]  All right. So we need to salvage. What are these?
[3116.35s -> 3119.16s]  Whoa, yeah, I think they just
[3120.40s -> 3122.40s]  Also, if you're going up these you press reverse
[3122.84s -> 3128.54s]  You can just like hover over a chasm. So when a lot of bugs come out you can kind of just fill in the middle
[3128.54s -> 3131.86s]  Oh, I see you can just like go backwards. That's cool
[3132.42s -> 3137.07s]  That is really watch out there. Why watch what about there's some flying bugs in this game
[3138.03s -> 3143.59s]  So is that my only means of transportation? I have to use this to get up there wherever you're going
[3144.07s -> 3146.07s]  Yeah, or you can just like
[3146.39s -> 3150.86s]  You can just minecraft your way in I guess you can
[3151.46s -> 3155.54s]  It's not far. Then you're gonna want to save uses of your uh, yeah
[3156.38s -> 3166.57s]  Grapple. All right, let's get going. Good thing. I just wasted two of them. Yeah, watch out. There's a pit here
[3167.09s -> 3177.66s]  Okay, don't worry. So is this an opportunity to use this? Yeah, it's just too
[3179.26s -> 3182.20s]  It's a too steep now, it's really steep
[3186.50s -> 3191.64s]  How do I get out of here now if I'm this character
[3194.88s -> 3200.20s]  It looks too steep. I think I think you got it. Do I actually have to dig out of here?
[3200.80s -> 3216.42s]  Yeah here here here dig with me on this side. It should have brought a driller perhaps maybe
[3217.52s -> 3221.06s]  What is the other guy? There's the scout the driller the
[3221.72s -> 3229.38s]  Engineer but oh, yeah, you like build the turret. Yep. He builds turrets. All right. Thank you. Oh, yeah
[3229.38s -> 3231.38s]  No, and he makes platforms. He's really good
[3231.90s -> 3239.62s]  Makes plow that's awesome. Yeah, maybe I should play him so we can actually, you know get some teamwork going but I
[3240.22s -> 3244.70s]  What am I supposed to do about this? Can I make this jump? Is that gonna am I gonna hit the wall?
[3245.34s -> 3254.95s]  Can I jump from here? Can I jump from here? I try I don't know
[3255.39s -> 3264.80s]  Yep. All right, cool. Let's go. Are those the flowers we need? Oh, yeah, and you can dig while you're on it
[3264.80s -> 3269.02s]  You can like make a foothold. I mean, I wish we had a driller
[3269.62s -> 3271.22s]  We did
[3271.22s -> 3275.13s]  And I'd be really helpful right now if we had someone who could drill through this
[3275.73s -> 3289.72s]  We can but we're doing it manual drilling. I'm just burying the axe in the back of your head
[3290.56s -> 3298.98s]  That's what I think about you. Oh, there goes what does that mean? I don't what was what's on the computer?
[3298.98s -> 3304.98s]  I have no idea. It's been doing this with every game and I have no idea why what do you have for a graphics card?
[3307.31s -> 3309.31s]  I have 240 80
[3309.99s -> 3314.35s]  To a 240 80. I think it's like a tight next pass. Is this like
[3315.51s -> 3320.35s]  2804 be more than that. It's like what year is it? It's like it's like
[3321.19s -> 3323.19s]  1900
[3323.43s -> 3329.60s]  1900 you help me mine this I can't even go. Okay, there's like a
[3332.58s -> 3341.23s]  What are these dead we shouldn't have done that that was not but they weren't a threat the environment will
[3351.46s -> 3355.43s]  You're the most like environmentally conscious dwarf I have ever seen
[3358.18s -> 3361.76s]  We only know
[3364.04s -> 3369.51s]  Digging and killing but he just not drop anything here
[3371.09s -> 3380.61s]  I wish I could see more light. Oh, well, I have the light gun
[3381.61s -> 3383.41s]  Then your job
[3383.41s -> 3388.75s]  Yeah, but like I'm not blind. So I've been fine. That's cuz you turn your gamma all the way up
[3388.75s -> 3390.55s]  I've been I've been to his house
[3390.55s -> 3397.17s]  You haven't been to Austin and he turns up his gamma all the way and then pretends like he can see really well
[3397.21s -> 3399.21s]  It's bullshit
[3400.46s -> 3410.00s]  Look out we got blood. Yes, we do
[3411.30s -> 3413.90s]  Remember we're at a higher hazard level German
[3413.90s -> 3424.82s]  I like this this game actually is really fun when you have people and you're on the really high difficulty
[3424.82s -> 3426.74s]  You got a hustle
[3426.74s -> 3428.98s]  There's a million buggos seems like it
[3430.62s -> 3437.90s]  But you just can't stop making jokes for more than like two seconds I didn't start it for loads in last
[3441.66s -> 3445.18s]  Alright cool
[3450.38s -> 3455.48s]  You can't take cadences and make that some kind of an insult like everybody has cadences
[3456.40s -> 3459.00s]  You can't make a cadence it is like come on
[3463.98s -> 3469.78s]  It's a cat I have we all have cadences form of like political correctness were you like
[3473.53s -> 3475.53s]  Cadence you can't make fun of a cadence
[3476.85s -> 3479.22s]  Alright cool
[3480.10s -> 3482.82s]  Get down here. Where are you my cadences?
[3485.43s -> 3488.63s]  Daring
[3489.11s -> 3493.49s]  How'd you feel about always sunny being a TV show at e3
[3494.15s -> 3498.70s]  It wasn't it was only one. Are you all right? Was that your computer?
[3499.78s -> 3503.12s]  Yeah, my computer just I didn't I guess I did what what's going on here
[3505.56s -> 3509.00s]  It was one person from the it's not even
[3511.16s -> 3513.16s]  Cast
[3513.16s -> 3516.92s]  Games are dumb watch my new show. No, it was one guy
[3517.16s -> 3519.16s]  And all right, I'm in trouble
[3521.92s -> 3525.42s]  Who is doing this what the fuck is going on to me
[3530.31s -> 3535.67s]  You see I'm shouting I don't know
[3536.63s -> 3540.79s]  We got swarmed and you ran away and started making always sunny references separate it
[3541.43s -> 3544.24s]  Look, I'm shouting what?
[3545.20s -> 3550.24s]  Oh god, you're fucking what is going on right now. You're loading in last right now
[3550.72s -> 3552.40s]  Loads in last
[3552.40s -> 3554.40s]  I'm flying
[3554.48s -> 3556.88s]  I am flying around getting carried away by a bug
[3561.44s -> 3568.56s]  Shouldn't have dropped me getting it. I'm coming. I'm still i'm fine. That's like a smoker
[3571.01s -> 3576.20s]  Can you shout so I know you are?
[3576.20s -> 3579.24s]  There you are. I don't know. How did you even get over there?
[3581.44s -> 3583.44s]  Well, I saw that you were down here and I was
[3584.00s -> 3586.00s]  Seeing if I could
[3587.91s -> 3591.57s]  It seemed faster
[3592.53s -> 3596.16s]  You're flying
[3596.16s -> 3599.44s]  This is what happens when you're in a dream when you're in a flying flying dream
[3599.44s -> 3601.68s]  You don't have control of where you're flying. You just know you are
[3611.92s -> 3616.00s]  Jeremy i'm taking care of this bug. All right, this bug is dead here. You see where I am
[3617.60s -> 3619.60s]  Yeah, okay. Let's go
[3621.54s -> 3623.62s]  All right. Um, I just showed up just in time
[3624.26s -> 3630.92s]  I dug a really big hole for you
[3631.32s -> 3632.92s]  You did that for me?
[3632.92s -> 3634.92s]  I did it for you
[3635.88s -> 3647.04s]  Let there be life
[3647.04s -> 3650.72s]  There's my hole I think is that no, that's not my hole. There it is up there
[3651.60s -> 3655.88s]  That's a big hole
[3655.88s -> 3656.76s]  What?
[3656.76s -> 3658.76s]  You can fly around you have a grapple hook
[3659.24s -> 3665.06s]  What does that have to do with anything that has to do with you have to be aware that I can't do that
[3665.22s -> 3667.30s]  You have to help me. I'm the ground force
[3669.27s -> 3671.54s]  Okay, edf
[3671.54s -> 3673.64s]  Yeah, that'll be fun. We are the valiant
[3674.64s -> 3676.79s]  infantry
[3676.79s -> 3679.12s]  We're the
[3679.12s -> 3684.16s]  That's the only thing I know
[3684.16s -> 3687.20s]  Defend our mother earth from any alley and attack
[3691.44s -> 3692.80s]  Huge room
[3692.80s -> 3695.30s]  Oh, is this is this one of the mules?
[3696.71s -> 3697.99s]  Probably
[3697.99s -> 3699.89s]  That looks like a mule and watch out
[3699.89s -> 3704.77s]  All right. These things just are blowing up all over the place around us. I'm almost dead. They're bainlings. Those things are horrible
[3712.08s -> 3713.52s]  Oh shit
[3713.52s -> 3722.36s]  I think we got to dig this up. Oh, yeah. We got to we got to pick up all the parts
[3725.43s -> 3735.09s]  What oh
[3735.81s -> 3739.89s]  Oh help help help help my computer's lagging
[3741.09s -> 3744.85s]  I can't help you. Uh, three more of those creepers came and exploded on us
[3750.05s -> 3753.81s]  How did you end up down there I got picked up by a fly bug
[3754.85s -> 3756.85s]  He just threw you down the hole
[3762.84s -> 3765.96s]  Where's my recorder where's my recorder for it?
[3775.72s -> 3777.72s]  Why'd you have it on hazard five
[3778.20s -> 3782.60s]  I didn't I had it on hazard like we're confident people that can play this game
[3789.68s -> 3793.76s]  Guys, can I have like a thousand people diagnose my computer problem all at once?
[3800.10s -> 3802.10s]  Uh, all right, I know I can help you
[3802.50s -> 3804.50s]  Give me the symptoms. When do they start?
[3805.48s -> 3807.48s]  It's like inner minutely
[3809.28s -> 3814.88s]  Every like 10 minutes, okay, my game freezes like four times. Do you have any hard disks?
[3816.44s -> 3818.68s]  No, are you all solid state?
[3818.76s -> 3820.76s]  Yes, are you sure?
[3820.84s -> 3823.48s]  Yes, okay. When was the last time you did a driver update?
[3827.19s -> 3828.95s]  Good question
[3828.95s -> 3831.89s]  May have just solved your problem
[3837.49s -> 3840.92s]  Also
[3840.92s -> 3843.28s]  how
[3843.28s -> 3845.28s]  Much ram do you have?
[3847.52s -> 3851.56s]  um
[3851.56s -> 3855.00s]  You're gonna tell me to download more. No, i'm not that's but it's like
[3856.34s -> 3858.85s]  2017 joke
[3858.85s -> 3862.21s]  Yeah, I mean you do them sometimes you were doing the flossing dance earlier
[3864.24s -> 3868.02s]  2017 is really not that long ago. So like that joke would still be kind of relevant
[3868.02s -> 3870.42s]  But no, how much what do you have 32 16?
[3871.38s -> 3874.90s]  Uh, I think I have two 16. I didn't do the flop first of all
[3874.98s -> 3878.58s]  I need to like 70 scream in you i'm gonna scream in your face as loud as I can
[3879.46s -> 3883.94s]  I did not do the floss you put the jukebox on and took control of my computer and made that happen
[3885.78s -> 3887.78s]  But I also did see you dab before
[3888.58s -> 3893.62s]  So have you
[3893.62s -> 3897.14s]  No, last time I was at your house you did
[3898.16s -> 3900.16s]  Please just let the barrels be
[3900.40s -> 3901.92s]  Last time you're on my own
[3901.92s -> 3908.32s]  All right. Let's let's do that mission again, but not on like ultra inferno mode. That was that's like normal difficulty. Is this
[3909.12s -> 3912.05s]  Let me see
[3912.05s -> 3914.05s]  We should be able to do that
[3916.82s -> 3924.76s]  He's deflecting i'm not deflecting we're doing it the same difficulty
[3925.96s -> 3927.96s]  And you know what i'm gonna switch characters
[3929.20s -> 3931.57s]  Tell him I that's what i'm gonna do
[3931.57s -> 3934.93s]  So that I can work together with you and you know, we can both be low level newbies
[3935.01s -> 3937.49s]  So i'm gonna be the driller again. I kind of like that. It was fun
[3938.69s -> 3942.85s]  Okay, and i'll be the engineer so at least I can travel around now and I have an upgrade now
[3943.41s -> 3946.28s]  Do you accept me?
[3946.28s -> 3948.28s]  Yes, why why wouldn't I?
[3950.40s -> 3952.32s]  That's a pretty do that that
[3953.20s -> 3956.56s]  Bro, that's an epic beard. I can't there's too many people talking
[3958.04s -> 3960.84s]  There's voices in my head. I'm the only person talking to you
[3968.20s -> 3972.52s]  Yep. All right
[3972.52s -> 3974.52s]  I think you've played too many sounds
[3977.73s -> 3982.69s]  You played too many other how many other people you got on that sound board it was normal man was talking to me
[3984.72s -> 3986.72s]  He interrupts my stream sometimes
[3986.88s -> 3988.72s]  normal man
[3988.72s -> 3990.80s]  Yeah, wait, there's a couple characters around here
[3994.63s -> 3996.63s]  Normal man's just telling me to kill yerma
[3998.79s -> 4001.00s]  well, um
[4001.00s -> 4002.92s]  Don't listen to that guy
[4002.92s -> 4005.32s]  I'm not don't don't worry. They're all corrupted see
[4007.81s -> 4010.37s]  Everyone banded together and killed justin so I replaced him with kimberly
[4010.37s -> 4013.25s]  But kimberly was secretly the person who killed justin so I had to get rid of kimberly
[4013.73s -> 4016.37s]  And then we got japanese voice lady who apparently is god
[4017.25s -> 4022.69s]  And we went through a couple of different guys and now it's normal guy normal man who likes, uh, white bread and tennis
[4023.65s -> 4027.62s]  You should probably go to a doctor if I would have
[4028.34s -> 4031.35s]  Give you some advice. You probably should hit up a doctor
[4032.07s -> 4036.31s]  Okay. Yeah, you try and explain the germa lore to somebody and like not have to see a therapist
[4041.84s -> 4050.18s]  How do we know that i'm not one of the voices in your head
[4050.98s -> 4054.84s]  I don't know. How could you i've been playing alone this whole time
[4055.72s -> 4057.80s]  Just like who does he think he's with
[4059.62s -> 4061.46s]  He's just talking

[4078.61s -> 4080.37s]  All right, which one this is like
[4080.37s -> 4082.61s]  All right, so that's my spotlight. That's your spotlight
[4083.41s -> 4092.28s]  Is this when the curtain comes up and there's an audience back here?
[4094.20s -> 4104.24s]  I got all solid state too
[4104.24s -> 4105.60s]  This is bullshit
[4105.60s -> 4116.55s]  Okay. Um, sorry, I had to shoot that thing. Okay. Okay. You see this flower
[4117.11s -> 4118.95s]  Do I see this flower? I do

[4120.95s -> 4123.48s]  I'm back here
[4123.48s -> 4127.56s]  Let's do okay, but no more fucking around like we made our funny joke. This is a serious mission. No more
[4127.56s -> 4133.32s]  There's no secrets here. We made our one joke. It's been like five minutes. Let's just get to it, right?
[4133.80s -> 4137.62s]  Yes, why why wouldn't I I that's what I said to yourself
[4138.26s -> 4139.38s]  I was
[4139.38s -> 4141.67s]  And you kind of interrupted me
[4141.67s -> 4148.55s]  Okay, I should be playing this multi-boxing with three other me's
[4149.35s -> 4152.36s]  I'm gonna get so much done and then you would make the pro team
[4152.92s -> 4156.56s]  You want to dig through here? I can handle that
[4157.97s -> 4160.85s]  Oh your drew guy. Yeah, that's why I changed
[4161.57s -> 4173.33s]  Uh wrong way. I figured yeah, what the heck that should have been right though. That is weird
[4175.86s -> 4177.22s]  uh
[4177.22s -> 4180.76s]  Because yeah, these dirt areas always lead to a new path
[4181.64s -> 4183.62s]  Here it is
[4183.70s -> 4186.82s]  Uh computer a computer's break. Oh, okay. How's your computer?
[4188.20s -> 4193.70s]  Not not good
[4193.70s -> 4195.06s]  Uh now it's fine
[4195.06s -> 4196.74s]  Maybe this is what they have
[4196.74s -> 4198.74s]  No, there's definitely you got a virus
[4199.68s -> 4201.60s]  Yeah, I I look at a lot of just
[4202.32s -> 4203.60s]  Messed up stuff

[6567.79s -> 6569.84s]  Don't do it
[6569.84s -> 6571.84s]  I'm not sure he's fired the gun
[6572.40s -> 6576.36s]  But he doesn't need to

[7303.82s -> 7306.49s]  Queuing up more
[7306.49s -> 7311.07s]  What every time that every time you guys are quiet for more than 10 seconds

[7419.53s -> 7422.17s]  It was so funny because it was like it feels like you're so polite
[7422.49s -> 7426.73s]  You can't interrupt yourself. You like give yourself the time to talk, but it's not even real

[8564.67s -> 8565.79s]  All right
[8565.79s -> 8568.48s]  I I think that
[8571.53s -> 8576.89s]  Over here on the yellow thing there is a device that comes out that gives you extra money
[8583.36s -> 8585.36s]  I get this clip

[8597.02s -> 8600.30s]  Eehaw eehaw thing. I would hate to get my oh my lawyers involved in this one
[8606.92s -> 8610.12s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the prelude to what would ultimately become
[8610.84s -> 8616.84s]  Recording without telling the people you're playing with that you're recording so that no clips would need be shared
[8617.32s -> 8619.72s]  And all would belong to the clipper
[8620.68s -> 8622.92s]  It's pretty good strategy actually
[8625.24s -> 8627.48s]  Natalix, did you uh level up your
[8627.96s -> 8630.76s]  Inside of your weapon to be able to shoot things out of it

[8659.07s -> 8668.62s]  The secret gem that we dug out of the wall was put in the supply drop, right following somebody who's good at this game

[9219.18s -> 9229.15s]  Looking for nitro
[9229.15s -> 9232.83s]  Good question. How come one of these games hasn't done like a voice pack like that
[9233.79s -> 9235.76s]  like what

[9307.71s -> 9309.71s]  I'm dead. I'm good. I'm dead, too
[9310.03s -> 9314.75s]  I don't like I don't understand how there was only enough nitro to call in one supply drop
[9315.31s -> 9317.31s]  For like the first three areas
[9328.09s -> 9333.53s]  What is it is we have four people so it's 400 more hp and 400 less resources
[9334.49s -> 9335.92s]  Yeah
[9335.92s -> 9337.92s]  We have this dead weight
[9340.14s -> 9342.14s]  Ronnie's not even in the call. Why would you say that?
[9342.70s -> 9345.98s]  I feel like he's listening to all of the streams at once
[9346.94s -> 9348.94s]  Let's see if anyone mentions him
[9351.63s -> 9357.55s]  Uh, well, he is getting him in the call. He is communicating. He said bad in all capitals
[9359.68s -> 9364.38s]  He did say bad

[9393.90s -> 9395.90s]  Noob driller
[9396.54s -> 9401.39s]  Is it the new class? Whatever you pick
[9410.22s -> 9415.80s]  How come I can't go on the ship? Oh, I didn't take a mission
[9418.49s -> 9420.49s]  I feel like this is how you dance in vr
[9423.23s -> 9425.87s]  You don't want to move around that much because you don't want to bump into your walls
[9432.24s -> 9434.08s]  Dude I go nuts
[9434.08s -> 9444.17s]  You can't use your legs in vr. Yes, you can if you have trackers on them. Yeah, you just
[9444.81s -> 9448.09s]  They have the loops like the oculus controllers. You just stick your feet through the loop
[9448.89s -> 9451.20s]  And then you play with poor controllers
[9454.46s -> 9456.46s]  All right. Are we ready to we'll get this is
[9456.70s -> 9458.94s]  This is a pure gamer
[9459.10s -> 9463.04s]  Part of the level. Okay, I haven't won anything since i've been here. So i'll take responsibility

[9472.49s -> 9474.49s]  I didn't oh I didn't pick that
[9477.93s -> 9479.93s]  I didn't even go into my ship
[9480.49s -> 9482.49s]  These tough those beards are so huge
[9488.24s -> 9490.40s]  That's just like that's so much hair
[9491.71s -> 9495.71s]  I feel like I would trip on that here. Is there like a button in here that just takes us back to the base?
[9495.79s -> 9497.79s]  No, we're winning this
[9498.64s -> 9501.44s]  Mine that this is a simple mining mission. You got it
[9512.65s -> 9514.65s]  Does the drill work is a better miner?
[9515.90s -> 9517.90s]  Someone okay, who's hosting this?
[9518.54s -> 9524.12s]  How I was posting what me this my computer freaks out every 10 minutes and then the game freaks out
[9524.52s -> 9528.52s]  Because I just lagged off the clip. Yeah, that's happening. That's my fault
[9529.32s -> 9533.42s]  Okay, I got the uh gold
[9533.42s -> 9541.36s]  There we go. Okay, dig through the dirt dig through the dirt. Let's dig through this dirt
[9542.16s -> 9547.77s]  You gotta hustle you take too long. Then there's a million things
[9548.41s -> 9551.28s]  dig through dirt
[9551.28s -> 9553.28s]  I doubt I've just planned. Okay
[9553.36s -> 9555.20s]  Going through the dirt. Wait
[9555.20s -> 9558.68s]  Okay

[9590.91s -> 9594.60s]  I don't know something like
[9594.60s -> 9598.76s]  Charge me. It's hard to think of something better to say right on the spot. You can't even think of anything
[9598.76s -> 9600.76s]  You're like, why don't you say? Um
[9600.84s -> 9602.84s]  Well, it's because I was looking at something
[9603.34s -> 9605.74s]  Yeah, i'm not afraid to share what my desires are
[9606.70s -> 9608.22s]  like some people
[9608.22s -> 9610.46s]  That are so bottled up
[9610.46s -> 9614.06s]  And taught by society that you're home supposed to you know, not be licked
[9616.70s -> 9622.33s]  But you do it anyway, right?
[9622.97s -> 9626.11s]  All right, you're killing one hit I did
[9627.15s -> 9629.15s]  All right. So now where are we going?
[9630.27s -> 9632.35s]  We need to extract
[9632.35s -> 9634.36s]  All right. There's uh this
[9634.36s -> 9638.08s]  crusty stuff here
[9638.08s -> 9642.32s]  I'm gonna dump the uh gold and the I got a lot of nitra and a lot of gold watch out spiders
[9644.76s -> 9646.76s]  Why what's with this broken game?
[9647.48s -> 9649.29s]  Okay, we're good
[9649.29s -> 9658.62s]  I want that. Uh, right killed in one hit
[9659.26s -> 9665.79s]  Now we got a lot of gold in there a lot of uh nitro
[9669.18s -> 9671.74s]  I'll scout ahead as the class name implies
[9672.30s -> 9675.98s]  Hey, i'll come with you. Yeah, let's stick together stick together. There's no reason for us to split up right?
[9676.78s -> 9681.50s]  Don't like don't split up because you're the gamer star and you'd like to go forward really fast
[9681.58s -> 9686.70s]  And then that's what this class does. No, you're supposed to go back to back to back to back and just walk together
[9689.02s -> 9691.42s]  Look at us mining this together doesn't feel good
[9692.64s -> 9698.52s]  It is fun
[9698.52s -> 9700.52s]  Take my hand take my hand
[9702.09s -> 9703.92s]  Okay, let's go

[9720.65s -> 9723.45s]  He's not with ronnie would be able to tell me if ronnie were here
[9724.01s -> 9726.99s]  Oh my god, you do not want to talk to ronnie. He's insufferable
[9733.07s -> 9734.91s]  Why are you so rude?
[9734.91s -> 9736.19s]  always
[9736.19s -> 9744.51s]  I like these blue crystals
[9744.59s -> 9746.43s]  They light the place up

[9941.50s -> 9943.50s]  You can see it through the wall
[9957.61s -> 9959.61s]  Now my computer is freaking out i'm gonna die
[9964.56s -> 9973.77s]  I don't give you permission to put that when I screamed I screamed like so hard I farted

[10197.56s -> 10201.47s]  Do we look at my keyboard when I type?
[10201.63s -> 10209.92s]  Yeah, I didn't grow up with a computer in my lap. I had to learn it's like learning a new language. I learned I started

[10245.95s -> 10247.95s]  You had to crank the generator for it
[10250.28s -> 10255.13s]  Or one of us in here is uh spoiled. Oh, that was perfect
[10265.28s -> 10278.29s]  I never had a cranking generator. All right, are we good? No, why is there another one of these they just keep coming out of nowhere
[10285.87s -> 10289.63s]  You guys really were digging down like parallel to the hole that I made for you
[10290.35s -> 10294.99s]  We were already most of the way down when you made your hole and then I couldn't get to your hole
[10296.27s -> 10302.43s]  You could have and you don't you just don't understand how this game is supposed to be played. I understand. I just don't believe you
[10302.75s -> 10305.12s]  You're a noob
[10305.12s -> 10307.84s]  Did you not resurrect the other guy like you were the one in the hole?
[10311.60s -> 10313.60s]  You didn't get other guy
[10314.40s -> 10316.40s]  Oh, you didn't get other guy
[10317.28s -> 10327.96s]  Hey, he didn't get other guy. Okay, there's one resupply here, but it's like in the wall
[10333.48s -> 10336.44s]  Another swarm so resupply and um be ready
[10338.28s -> 10343.40s]  Uh, i'm good on supplies because you haven't played in an hour. Yeah pretty much
[10344.84s -> 10347.02s]  Is that a record scratch?
[10355.00s -> 10358.60s]  Why did this turn into like a fucking am talk show
[10360.44s -> 10362.44s]  Another record scratch. That's my screen
[10377.13s -> 10379.23s]  Oh, I think I just fucking destroyed ronnie
[10383.13s -> 10386.86s]  I think it's a right of passage at this point. I did that earlier
[10395.77s -> 10398.43s]  Get off me
[10398.43s -> 10400.43s]  There's too many. There's too many
[10403.44s -> 10405.44s]  So the hitbox wasn't the problem
[10413.23s -> 10415.31s]  Thank god, all right, we don't have any
[10417.13s -> 10419.13s]  Uh, do we have enough for supplies?
[10419.53s -> 10422.03s]  No, we don't
[10422.43s -> 10424.11s]  What the hell are we gonna do?
[10424.11s -> 10426.59s]  We have to keep going forward and get resupply
[10430.19s -> 10432.19s]  Like let's start fighting forward down this hill
[10435.18s -> 10437.02s]  Push through, you know
[10437.02s -> 10439.02s]  three three
[10442.91s -> 10444.91s]  This is one of these things
[10446.44s -> 10450.92s]  Uh down here. Oh, why did you hold control? Hold, uh control you can see where we are
[10450.92s -> 10454.68s]  Oh god, I found like a mother sack or something hard to hold control when i'm dead
[10457.48s -> 10460.20s]  Are you dead? Oh, yeah, then why does it matter where we went?
[10462.56s -> 10466.08s]  Are we killing the sack
[10471.85s -> 10476.68s]  Bad not good. There's a lot of ore over here
[10485.08s -> 10487.32s]  Hey germa, you have drill I do have
[10488.68s -> 10490.84s]  I'm underneath you get up here
[10492.68s -> 10494.84s]  I'm making the call you're making the call
[10495.72s -> 10499.77s]  All right, what do you got? What do you need control dig towards his dead body?
[10501.07s -> 10503.07s]  You're i'm digging. Yeah that way
[10503.31s -> 10513.02s]  Hold on out of uh, how did yours?
[10513.98s -> 10520.72s]  Like the last millisecond I realized what that was on the ground. I was like, oh, what is that man?
[10521.36s -> 10523.36s]  That was almost my clip
[10523.44s -> 10525.64s]  almost
[10525.64s -> 10527.64s]  Almost your clip
[10532.91s -> 10535.55s]  There's a lot of this we've gotten 20 more pipes
[10536.51s -> 10538.51s]  Yeah, it's pretty bad, isn't it?
[10540.08s -> 10545.04s]  I thought we were just here shooting bugs for fun. To be honest, there's also the uh, those those those
[10545.82s -> 10547.82s]  crystal, um
[10547.84s -> 10549.84s]  It's a lag crystal light drinks
[10550.36s -> 10552.68s]  Crystal light is as literal poison. Don't drink it
[10553.56s -> 10559.72s]  That's all ashley, but she doesn't drink it. She eats the dust. She doesn't mix it with water. She just eats the dust
[10560.20s -> 10562.20s]  Please be kidding
[10562.28s -> 10565.80s]  No, ronnie how many times you heard me say ashley eats dust
[10566.76s -> 10570.76s]  Uh, I just always assumed the dust came with liquid wait
[10571.48s -> 10573.48s]  She she eats crystal light dust
[10573.96s -> 10576.04s]  Yeah, are these like drug code words?
[10580.59s -> 10585.79s]  Like I heard a peanut butter dust, but I assume she mixed it. She also eats the peanut butter too dust
[10585.87s -> 10589.47s]  That's that's like an apocalypse peanut butter. Okay, she does mix that. All right
[10591.00s -> 10593.96s]  But does that crystal light's not okay crystal light?
[10594.84s -> 10596.92s]  Uh, is that what they're calling it nowadays? Okay
[10599.02s -> 10600.38s]  Where we going?
[10600.38s -> 10602.75s]  I don't know need we've 65 out of 200
[10604.49s -> 10605.45s]  um
[10605.45s -> 10606.49s]  we need
[10606.49s -> 10610.33s]  Honestly, we meet we need more nitro. Oh, I'm my we're out of ammo like again
[10614.09s -> 10617.13s]  Basically what you're looking for at this point when you don't know where to go is one of those dirt walls
[10617.77s -> 10619.69s]  Would be the next area
[10619.69s -> 10626.20s]  It's probably not a good idea. I think i'm going backwards
[10629.42s -> 10631.26s]  Yeah, we shouldn't go this way
[10631.26s -> 10633.82s]  Not this way
[10633.82s -> 10635.82s]  I'm not talking to you. I'm gonna stick some
[10636.54s -> 10639.50s]  Oh, you're coming this way too. Yeah, not this way. I know everyone was following me
[10640.54s -> 10642.91s]  And you're king
[10642.91s -> 10644.83s]  I'm the king
[10644.83s -> 10649.47s]  Well, if she likes crystal light dust, why doesn't she just get like a pixie stick? It's kind of that same thing
[10651.12s -> 10656.08s]  I think one of them is free of calories. Thank you. Yeah zero calories
[10656.88s -> 10658.56s]  It would have to be
[10658.56s -> 10660.56s]  Oh, there's a thing in there
[10660.64s -> 10662.56s]  Is this nitro or
[10662.56s -> 10666.16s]  Oh, I found a bunch of nitro pixie sticks are for when you want to get serious, you know
[10666.72s -> 10668.72s]  Crystal light light is in the name
[10669.60s -> 10671.60s]  Crystal light dust is a
[10672.96s -> 10674.96s]  It's a gateway drug to pixie
[10675.92s -> 10679.68s]  Her parents are visiting this weekend and we went out to a river and we were swimming in the river
[10680.72s -> 10683.18s]  and she
[10683.18s -> 10685.18s]  Won't admit it was a river
[10685.87s -> 10687.55s]  And i'm worried about her
[10687.55s -> 10689.55s]  She keeps saying it was a lake
[10689.55s -> 10692.43s]  Was the water moving in one direction? Yeah
[10693.15s -> 10695.15s]  It's a river. Oh, it's here
[10695.15s -> 10696.03s]  I got the thing
[10696.11s -> 10700.99s]  I think she was calling it a lake because she could you can't see either end of the river because it was like a bend
[10700.99s -> 10702.99s]  So it looked like a lake
[10703.15s -> 10705.31s]  But she like won't admit that it was a river
[10706.92s -> 10709.88s]  But it's a hundred and six mile long river
[10711.48s -> 10714.75s]  What's it doing over here
[10714.83s -> 10719.39s]  Well rivers that are exactly the mule up here to be honest. That's just insulting to cartographers. Okay
[10720.11s -> 10721.87s]  it's more well see
[10721.95s -> 10728.67s]  Little known fact rivers that are exactly 106 miles long are actually classified as lake really
[10729.23s -> 10731.60s]  Yeah
[10731.68s -> 10733.68s]  This is a very long lake
[10738.09s -> 10740.09s]  That and she's eating the dust
[10740.81s -> 10745.29s]  She's eating the lake dust. She won't let me like hear her either. She's eating the lake dust to her
[10745.37s -> 10747.37s]  She's like go away. I'm gassy
[10751.36s -> 10753.36s]  I deposited the uh the jade thing
[10753.68s -> 10761.45s]  Something again, uh, okay, I guess you're just gonna talk about the game. I have like a real narrow problem
[10762.57s -> 10764.49s]  malachite
[10764.49s -> 10770.09s]  Listen, I opened up to you guys some people need to understand which is not an excuse for your mental health. Okay
[10771.05s -> 10773.05s]  You handle that with a professional
[10775.85s -> 10777.85s]  We've got bugs surrounding
[10779.96s -> 10783.28s]  Where's that dang wheel?
[10783.28s -> 10785.84s]  I need it. I'm finding all the stuff you people need
[10786.88s -> 10792.76s]  Oh god, I also found monsters
[10794.78s -> 10797.02s]  No, no, no, don't fall down all the way. I'm good
[10801.52s -> 10804.86s]  I'm trying to knock it killed. Where's this mule?
[10807.77s -> 10810.43s]  You called it
[10810.43s -> 10819.96s]  Okay, we gotta go up top here. Is there no more supply? We're close. We gotta keep pushing
[10824.12s -> 10825.40s]  That's not good
[10825.40s -> 10831.61s]  Where's that loot bunk?
[10832.65s -> 10838.80s]  What's so funny what
[10839.64s -> 10841.80s]  Are you dead? Who's dead?
[10842.68s -> 10846.17s]  Hey, that was that was definitely going on that stream
[10849.85s -> 10852.65s]  Guys I don't want to alarm you but
[10853.61s -> 10860.67s]  Not by everyone literally everyone we need to go to the top
[10862.25s -> 10868.97s]  Well, i'm trying to people are dying. I'm trying to wrangle children. I'm i'm people are dying down here
[10869.77s -> 10872.97s]  We're dying down here. You set up up in your tower and fucking look down
[10875.82s -> 10877.90s]  We're trying to make things happen down here trying to survive
[10888.06s -> 10890.30s]  Are you posting the picture of me hugging the waterfall?
[10893.44s -> 10897.77s]  dead
[10897.77s -> 10899.77s]  All right, we've broken through
[10900.09s -> 10903.23s]  But I think that we ended up
[10903.23s -> 10906.91s]  The hell did we end up?
[10906.91s -> 10910.19s]  I think we already think we've wrapped around in a circle. I think
[10910.75s -> 10912.75s]  Uh shit
[10913.15s -> 10915.15s]  You were so adamant of us coming up here
[10916.51s -> 10919.87s]  I'm being chased by cave godzilla. Just trying to get you guys

[10925.00s -> 10927.56s]  I swear to god, I can't believe that that hurt me that much
[10935.80s -> 10938.12s]  Where were we off to up here? I don't know
[10938.84s -> 10941.60s]  Look at the map the map we
[10944.22s -> 10946.22s]  We could go down
[10946.38s -> 10949.74s]  Down to the left lower left. We kind of have to like go all the way down left
[10950.46s -> 10953.18s]  If you open up the map sweet, we gotta go this way then
[10955.45s -> 10956.81s]  Follow me
[10956.81s -> 10958.41s]  We're going down here
[10958.41s -> 10969.53s]  We need to go like this way
[10969.61s -> 10971.93s]  Poison i'm losing it. All right, we need to go
[10972.89s -> 10974.81s]  All right over here

[11058.97s -> 11062.33s]  Hey, remember how we skipped the last like 45 minutes of us looking around in the youtube video
[11062.33s -> 11065.13s]  So we can get to this part. This is it guys. Yeah, we just cut
[11066.09s -> 11076.94s]  No, we just leave it all unedited but cut into 10 minute slices and say it's just the episode
[11076.94s -> 11078.94s]  We finally find the more guys
[11079.26s -> 11081.90s]  That's the title. Sorry guys tune in next time
[11082.86s -> 11087.18s]  Oh, no more kite this time guys click here to subscribe aliens
[11087.98s -> 11089.98s]  If you keep saying this i'm not going to be able to do it

[11115.61s -> 11121.69s]  What like it like an entitled thing to say i'm calling resupply do not touch the red button
[11125.72s -> 11128.91s]  Germa don't what do you not want me to do?
[11134.48s -> 11135.84s]  Here's the question
[11135.84s -> 11138.64s]  If they can just drop resupply pods from wherever they want
[11139.20s -> 11143.20s]  Why don't they just arm us with the drill that the resupply pod uses?
[11145.44s -> 11149.02s]  Shut up, uh because
[11150.35s -> 11152.35s]  Never mind. I was gonna say like a tv show thing
[11154.33s -> 11158.33s]  I mean, this is pretty much like the faster than light star wars issue all over again
[11159.13s -> 11161.37s]  Okay, so we need a second to plan when you look at the map
[11162.17s -> 11164.17s]  And try and figure out where we came back from
[11164.97s -> 11168.81s]  You press the button the thing walks back. You can either follow the mule or we can just start drilling
[11169.37s -> 11172.89s]  Well up if you want I we can start drilling up if you want
[11173.45s -> 11175.93s]  We got to be ready for that though. Where from where you want to go?
[11176.89s -> 11179.12s]  It looks like you can also okay. Come on
[11179.12s -> 11182.96s]  We can just start walking this way and then call the mule to us. We could just we okay. Hold on
[11183.60s -> 11184.80s]  Come over here
[11184.80s -> 11186.97s]  If we go over here
[11187.29s -> 11191.52s]  If we go through this tunnel and then up
[11193.45s -> 11195.79s]  Yeah, like this way
[11195.79s -> 11197.79s]  Climb back up this climb back up that
[11198.43s -> 11203.04s]  Because we have to get back up to the top, right?
[11203.68s -> 11207.85s]  Yeah
[11207.85s -> 11210.57s]  Watch out it's bug city. Oh fuck it is bug city
[11213.98s -> 11226.72s]  Okay, so then from here
[11228.64s -> 11230.64s]  We should be able to go up this way
[11232.19s -> 11235.55s]  Just like straight up this way over here
[11236.70s -> 11238.73s]  right
[11238.73s -> 11240.25s]  because then
[11240.25s -> 11242.25s]  That'll take us like, uh
[11244.11s -> 11246.11s]  All right. Let's go. All right
[11248.91s -> 11252.43s]  Let's clear this and then we'll go clear that don't go yet
[11253.23s -> 11255.23s]  Yeah, just set up defense here
[11258.59s -> 11260.59s]  Otherwise, we're gonna get a swarm goal. We're trying to figure out

[11440.44s -> 11443.76s]  Where the hell did it go over there?
[11443.84s -> 11448.62s]  Oh shit
[11448.62s -> 11451.34s]  I'm never gonna dig 85 meters in four minutes

[11455.23s -> 11457.23s]  Hey, oh me the talics are up here

[11459.47s -> 11461.87s]  Oh different hole. Oh talics. What do we do?
[11462.43s -> 11466.43s]  Just uh, let the bugs let the bugs go eat them and we'll escape you gotta run
[11468.12s -> 11470.12s]  I'll i'll get up there eventually
[11470.44s -> 11472.44s]  Just look towards the drop pod and dig
[11474.44s -> 11480.59s]  Why'd you say you were there you're like
[11482.06s -> 11484.62s]  Hey, are we all right?
[11486.38s -> 11491.61s]  Turn around. Oh god. Are we okay?
[11493.15s -> 11495.87s]  Are we all right? Keep digging. I I have no fuel
[11499.20s -> 11501.20s]  I can't leave him behind
[11502.08s -> 11507.00s]  We're almost there
[11507.16s -> 11509.16s]  Where the fuck are we?
[11512.24s -> 11514.24s]  You said you were there
[11516.27s -> 11518.27s]  One for you and one for me
[11518.75s -> 11521.63s]  I actually ran the whole path
[11523.15s -> 11525.23s]  Oh, no, don't die
[11525.23s -> 11528.01s]  All right. I'm gonna go
[11528.01s -> 11531.05s]  No, which way is the right way which way it's the correct way
[11532.01s -> 11533.61s]  i'm down
[11533.61s -> 11539.13s]  Wait, where am I going?
[11539.13s -> 11542.27s]  No
[11544.59s -> 11546.91s]  See you at home
[11546.91s -> 11549.39s]  We all right to be fair. We did you get did you make it?
[11550.27s -> 11552.27s]  Yeah, he made it. Yes
[11552.59s -> 11554.59s]  We pulled everybody into that tunnel
[11563.74s -> 11567.50s]  Nice job everyone. I hope jerma stretched his shoulder before he threw that hard
[11567.58s -> 11573.18s]  I don't have nobody had any ammo. We didn't know we were i'm trying to like just dig we're fine. We the missions went we won
[11575.00s -> 11577.00s]  Yeah, we wanted i'm still alive
[11581.32s -> 11585.64s]  When you don't stick to the plan, this is what happens. Let's get back to work
[11588.06s -> 11590.38s]  You're still alive. Why are we resurrecting in the med bay?
[11591.44s -> 11593.44s]  Well because we were checking on you guys
[11597.34s -> 11598.78s]  That was so fucking bad though
[11598.86s -> 11603.26s]  Like I I had the depth wrong and I turned the camera and we're just like tunneling
[11603.90s -> 11606.06s]  Like a tube sock on the left side of the map
[11606.70s -> 11611.02s]  But we did pull everybody away from star and then we may have not have made it out alive without that
[11614.88s -> 11616.32s]  Yeah, I just bailed
[11616.32s -> 11624.43s]  And how do I get a second freaking turret? I don't see the upgrade for it
[11626.09s -> 11629.05s]  You should just always have two turrets. I had it at level one
[11630.25s -> 11634.17s]  I did back in the beta and I cannot figure out how to get my it's the same button
[11634.73s -> 11638.09s]  So like you press four to place the turret then you press four to place the next one
[11638.57s -> 11644.06s]  And when I do that, it just recalls the previous one. I don't think it should
[11651.82s -> 11654.59s]  what do you think faster shield regen rate
[11655.76s -> 11657.26s]  or
[11657.26s -> 11665.31s]  Regen starts sooner for shield. I'm gonna check out youtube videos who they say you're the what you're making it
[11665.39s -> 11667.15s]  You're making that video now
[11667.15s -> 11671.53s]  So yeah, he's trying to get some insider tips everyone saying sooner
[11672.41s -> 11677.45s]  I would get better guns before you can get armor stuff unless you just can't afford the other things
[11677.69s -> 11679.77s]  I mean, I have one upgrade already into my
[11680.65s -> 11681.93s]  I need
[11681.93s -> 11685.37s]  I need this like silver or it's like a silver circle
[11687.96s -> 11692.16s]  I don't have any of it. I don't know what it is
[11692.80s -> 11696.41s]  There's an upgrade that makes you have one better turret into the two weak jump
[11696.97s -> 11697.77s]  Oh
[11697.77s -> 11704.57s]  No, i've even oh I can switch which modifications i'm using. Aha. Yeah. Well, that's a game changer
[11705.37s -> 11706.49s]  Aha
[11706.49s -> 11712.52s]  Give me that better drill
[11712.52s -> 11718.16s]  All right, let me put some perks in
[11718.16s -> 11723.04s]  Accessories, oh shit. What is this stuff a clean shave? Oh, what was that company?
[11724.08s -> 11726.08s]  Dollar shave club. Wow
[11727.52s -> 11730.72s]  Doesn't even remember the name of it from the same stream we're getting another plug
[11733.02s -> 11736.06s]  By the way, I did this this is for uh, comedy purposes only
[11736.06s -> 11739.82s]  This is with no affiliation at all. We have to say that otherwise you could get in trouble before you just did
[11741.74s -> 11743.74s]  Fuck a shave club
[11744.94s -> 11750.14s]  I did this this this is an opinion of somebody here. This is I don't know. I did I I don't even know who this is
[11751.36s -> 11755.60s]  I've never met them before in my life. I don't know who they are. So glad is the best a man can get
[11758.56s -> 11761.60s]  I don't I don't I cannot confirm or deny any of the statements
[11762.49s -> 11764.49s]  What if i'm not a man?
[11768.84s -> 11772.16s]  Oh, these are just hats
[11772.16s -> 11773.12s]  Yeah
[11773.12s -> 11781.23s]  Well, that's cool
[11781.23s -> 11787.47s]  This upgrade screen is not rad and sexy as fuck making my tummy twerk. What the fuck are you talking about?
[11790.92s -> 11792.92s]  Are we ready

[11803.56s -> 11809.52s]  What's wrong?
[11809.52s -> 11812.80s]  It's just not being used to being handled by such a handsome man
[11813.52s -> 11820.59s]  I don't have any available perks. Yeah, I do
[11826.64s -> 11831.12s]  All right, what are these what are these? Hey, hey i'm on stirr's floor

[14042.04s -> 14045.48s]  It's in that little cave. Why is it all the way up there when I throw it to the bottom?
[14045.88s -> 14047.08s]  I don't know dude
[14047.08s -> 14049.08s]  Where did I where did it go? Oh, it's there
[14050.87s -> 14054.39s]  I don't know why would I why would I throw it down there if it was all the way up here
[14054.87s -> 14056.86s]  To explain that
[14056.86s -> 14057.98s]  I don't know
[14057.98s -> 14062.81s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. I just now realized I have a shield mic
[14064.42s -> 14066.42s]  That was pretty cool. I do hear the beep now

[14087.64s -> 14089.64s]  So we can do this this time
[14090.28s -> 14092.28s]  Let's focus and get this done
[14092.84s -> 14094.84s]  Legally speaking I did help
[14097.56s -> 14099.88s]  Yeah, germa has to go like kiss his dog or whatever
[14102.63s -> 14104.63s]  Well, not right this second
[14109.45s -> 14117.30s]  All right, are we doing this am I pressing the button yeah here we go
[14119.24s -> 14122.15s]  Over here
[14122.15s -> 14130.70s]  The mules are fine. I don't know why it always takes germa like six tries on the side of the draw six tries to do what?
[14131.50s -> 14135.40s]  What do I have what takes me six tries?
[14136.04s -> 14138.20s]  Forget it. Just you just forget it. You know what?
[14149.96s -> 14151.80s]  Germa, yeah
[14151.80s -> 14156.73s]  If we're supposed to just both be subscribed to each other for like friendship points
[14157.61s -> 14159.85s]  Aren't we just giving twitch money?
[14160.01s -> 14162.57s]  And then jeff bezos is that much closer to ruling the world?
[14163.45s -> 14165.61s]  Yeah
[14165.69s -> 14168.09s]  I I how about this just just unsubscribe however
[14169.13s -> 14173.61s]  Did you know that if you subscribe to another streamer, it could be attacked right off
[14174.81s -> 14179.21s]  Yeah, but what if we just both unsub from each other and I just like at a convention
[14179.21s -> 14181.53s]  Just give you a 50 dollar bill. You give me a 50 dollar bill
[14182.09s -> 14183.61s]  No, listen
[14183.61s -> 14185.13s]  You unsub
[14185.13s -> 14187.77s]  And then like every once in a while you come in my chat and you say hey
[14188.25s -> 14190.25s]  Give me a sub
[14190.57s -> 14192.57s]  And you'll get one
[14193.69s -> 14194.81s]  And then
[14194.89s -> 14199.94s]  You just leave I got a pearl
[14202.65s -> 14205.53s]  That way jeff bezos daddy bezos gets his money
[14206.49s -> 14208.49s]  Get in the core bar
[14210.10s -> 14213.13s]  That's the real goal
[14213.13s -> 14216.25s]  Well, I wanna all right. How about this? How about this is how this will work
[14216.25s -> 14219.61s]  Because if we just are giving subs to each other then we're just yeah
[14220.17s -> 14222.97s]  There's no reason for that. Just you give me 50 dollars
[14223.69s -> 14225.45s]  The next time I see you
[14225.45s -> 14229.53s]  Okay, so that'll cover like the year right whatever that'll cover like just called christmas
[14230.49s -> 14236.01s]  No, but then like next year like in two years i'll give you 50 dollars and like oh let's go to lunch
[14236.09s -> 14237.77s]  You know, i'll take you to lunch
[14237.77s -> 14241.93s]  Okay, so that's it's birthdays instead like I give you 50 dollars of stuff on your birthday
[14242.01s -> 14244.57s]  And then you give me 50 dollars of stuff on my birthday. Yeah

[14822.10s -> 14824.28s]  Cool one egg
[14824.28s -> 14826.28s]  What why is it world shaking?
[14826.28s -> 14828.76s]  Oh because they don't like it when you take their eggs. All right next one
[14828.76s -> 14830.36s]  I'm gonna find my way to the next one
[14830.36s -> 14832.60s]  There's some weird thing over here. I don't know if it's an egg
[14835.86s -> 14837.86s]  Yeah, there's one up this way
[14839.82s -> 14841.94s]  Here follow me
[14841.94s -> 14844.34s]  Oh god, this is so stupid. I didn't know I knew
[14845.46s -> 14848.58s]  Oh, there's a bush over here red bush thing over here
[14849.30s -> 14851.30s]  Where is the supply bush?
[14856.60s -> 14858.57s]  nitrous full
[14858.57s -> 14864.97s]  Shit is he is the mule being taken?
[14870.09s -> 14872.81s]  We got we got a big bug problem. Oh my god
[14874.79s -> 14876.79s]  Yeah, i'm up here on the cliff doing what I can
[14877.51s -> 14890.36s]  Oh boy, this is not good
[14890.52s -> 14892.84s]  Even even if you run sometimes you gotta kill enemies
[14895.22s -> 14897.53s]  Sometimes i'm going like crazy
[14907.64s -> 14911.96s]  Um, is there a reason why you're mining and not like helping everybody waiting for the enemies to come up here
[14911.96s -> 14914.36s]  So I can go down there and resurrect you. Um, just
[14915.48s -> 14917.56s]  He's playing like a clicker game
[14918.76s -> 14924.86s]  I don't buy it until I see it
[14924.86s -> 14931.06s]  Are you getting shot by like our friendly bot? No, it is not a friendly bot
[14931.14s -> 14935.06s]  There is a super giant robot that is shooting everyone down here, which is why we're all dead
[14937.88s -> 14954.94s]  And it doesn't like oh my god i'm dead
[14956.14s -> 14958.22s]  Oh now it has a health bar. That's a lot of health
[14959.42s -> 14962.50s]  There's nowhere to really run
[14962.50s -> 14967.62s]  Ah, man, it looks like we're losing. I think there's the way to the bot. You gotta kill the bot. Kill the bot
[14967.86s -> 14969.86s]  I've done so fast. I have so much health I can't
[14970.58s -> 14972.58s]  So that's what what was happening. All right
[14972.66s -> 14977.30s]  Well, let's see what my real problem was as I res germa first again. Look guys. We really tried this time
[14977.30s -> 14982.58s]  Okay, swear. I mean that that's that's like that that that's not true. But what happened actually was
[14983.30s -> 14988.98s]  Um, we did nobody knew that we had to kill the robot that was running out loud said wow, that's a corrupted bot
[14989.54s -> 14991.54s]  I think it was muted. Did you shoot?
[14993.27s -> 14996.22s]  I didn't see you shoot at it. Uh
[14996.38s -> 14998.46s]  I've been shooting it
[14998.46s -> 15001.66s]  Oh now you are a squad stream. You can all see that i've been shooting it
[15002.38s -> 15004.38s]  I'm gonna get your germ
[15004.46s -> 15007.50s]  Thanks, ronny. Just gotta set my thing up here
[15008.38s -> 15017.53s]  Damn, I keep getting froze
[15017.53s -> 15022.01s]  I'm gonna kind of dig myself in a hole so I can have some cover star. Did you beat sekiro?
[15023.59s -> 15026.15s]  Uh, I got the last loss. I honestly I hate that game
[15026.87s -> 15028.87s]  Did you put on passion?
[15030.23s -> 15032.15s]  So I did not want to
[15032.15s -> 15033.91s]  Spend the time on the last guy
[15033.91s -> 15035.91s]  I'm trying to risk hold on
[15039.00s -> 15041.96s]  So so sure you can say not you're the better the game. You're a better gamer
[15042.60s -> 15045.16s]  I just was scared. I did it. I just I was curious to play it
[15046.06s -> 15048.06s]  I didn't get your thoughts on it
[15049.53s -> 15052.49s]  My thoughts I didn't get your thoughts apparently you don't like it
[15053.69s -> 15063.72s]  No
[15063.72s -> 15068.04s]  Whoa, that kind of hurts my head. Oh god. This guy looks like short circuit
[15070.49s -> 15071.69s]  Oh
[15071.69s -> 15075.26s]  All right, it's dead
[15075.26s -> 15078.82s]  Restart it. Yes. Let's repair our enemy
[15083.34s -> 15089.02s]  But oh shoot is it a walking turret now without uh without any like obviously spoilers. I think it took me like
[15089.58s -> 15090.86s]  what 50
[15090.86s -> 15092.86s]  60 attempts at that final boss
[15094.71s -> 15096.31s]  That's insane
[15096.31s -> 15098.31s]  There's a final boss spoiler
[15098.55s -> 15099.75s]  Spoiler
[15099.75s -> 15101.75s]  Well, I didn't want to say what it is
[15102.55s -> 15104.39s]  Did you fight like?
[15104.39s -> 15106.71s]  Did you fight? Um, he's already
[15107.99s -> 15109.99s]  The big red fire demon. Yes
[15110.71s -> 15115.45s]  Okay, i'm not digging out of here
[15115.53s -> 15120.79s]  Only two out of six eggs. How long has it been?
[15122.07s -> 15124.07s]  I don't know. I was reading chat
[15126.42s -> 15128.42s]  I don't even know where I am
[15128.50s -> 15138.41s]  It's too dark
[15138.41s -> 15142.25s]  All right. We do we have we have we have we need one more egg in this area
[15142.25s -> 15145.19s]  Go over here. Where is it?
[15145.19s -> 15149.03s]  Yeah, I do. There's one up. There's one down. I'm gonna I'm gonna get the one that's up
[15149.91s -> 15157.29s]  That is weird. I have yet to see an egg. I have no idea what they look like inside the giant flesh ball
[15158.49s -> 15160.57s]  You have to dig and there's eggs inside of them
[15162.09s -> 15166.14s]  But if you press the tab on your map it shows you exactly where they are
[15167.58s -> 15169.58s]  And then you have to dig into
[15170.06s -> 15184.95s]  All right, what was that one?
[15184.95s -> 15186.23s]  low
[15191.22s -> 15197.14s]  Anyone keeping track of how many times i've explained this what the fuck did you get it? Um at least one
[15197.62s -> 15199.62s]  Oh, did you what'd you do with it?
[15206.12s -> 15217.13s]  How did you get in here back that way dude, it's i'm fucking in the room of mirrors right now
[15228.92s -> 15230.92s]  Oh
[15231.96s -> 15234.60s]  No, wait, why what the fuck
[15236.22s -> 15241.13s]  Goddamn minecraft. Oh shit. All right, i'm fine
[15242.09s -> 15245.03s]  Uh, we're gonna need
[15245.99s -> 15251.30s]  Pretty much everything i'm on it
[15255.82s -> 15256.78s]  Okay
[15256.78s -> 15258.78s]  I'm gaming with the where's the last two?
[15260.10s -> 15262.10s]  But they're like up this way
[15263.06s -> 15270.31s]  You're voting to kick me
[15270.31s -> 15272.31s]  I own I own the server
[15272.87s -> 15276.01s]  It's gonna take more than that
[15278.82s -> 15282.82s]  What is this bot doing? Because I have not seen it shooting at any bugs. It's kind of running around
[15283.99s -> 15285.99s]  Oh, i'm skiing around now
[15285.99s -> 15289.51s]  Yeah lag guy uses god mode in his own server
[15291.11s -> 15293.82s]  All right, this is really weird. I really am on skis
[15303.24s -> 15306.25s]  Um, it's ice
[15306.41s -> 15309.45s]  Yeah, it's gonna say aren't you from uh, boston. It's ice
[15311.46s -> 15314.34s]  I thought I was in boston. I thought I would like it
[15318.02s -> 15321.70s]  Uh, is there one more I can get that you have not got i'm gonna just go to the one behind me
[15322.26s -> 15332.31s]  There's two behind me here
[15332.39s -> 15334.55s]  This game reminds me of like war frame
[15335.88s -> 15337.24s]  War frame
[15337.24s -> 15340.68s]  Yeah, because you drop in you do an objective you're with four other people or three people
[15341.88s -> 15346.12s]  And he's like, oh you got you got to hack like three nodes and you're like, how did I hack three of them?
[15346.92s -> 15348.98s]  What did everyone else do?
[15348.98s -> 15350.98s]  I'm over on this too. I'm getting gold
[15352.07s -> 15355.61s]  Good job
[15355.61s -> 15359.85s]  Have you had prior experience though in warframe? I didn't have any experience. Actually. No, I did
[15359.85s -> 15361.85s]  I played for like five minutes with you and said no
[15364.68s -> 15367.80s]  Uh, not that the game is bad. I just was like no i'm all right
[15368.44s -> 15372.58s]  I just do you have a swarm on the way. All right. This is bad just protect
[15374.58s -> 15377.78s]  We have a supply
[15377.78s -> 15379.78s]  Uh, I called one down earlier
[15381.29s -> 15386.01s]  So it's it's way over there war frame is really really cool. I just couldn't get into it
[15390.76s -> 15401.02s]  Should we stick together for this swarm? We only need one more egg
[15401.98s -> 15407.10s]  And it's above four out of six eggs. Yeah, but there's one there's one thrown down. There's one up here
[15408.06s -> 15410.07s]  You're gonna break the egg
[15410.07s -> 15413.91s]  We'll throw the other egg down here then I mean I have another one. I don't want to go get it
[15414.07s -> 15416.23s]  It's up above us. It's like I don't want to go get it
[15416.31s -> 15419.11s]  It was like a swarm coming you want to get stuck in a hole somewhere and die
[15431.75s -> 15435.59s]  Oh now the uh, the the big monster tank is shooting things
[15441.78s -> 15446.02s]  All right, i'll go now. So where is it? I don't see it on the map. Oh, it's up this way
[15446.50s -> 15448.50s]  I'm gonna go try to get it
[15448.50s -> 15452.73s]  I mean I am the drill guy
[15456.54s -> 15458.97s]  What I can't go through this
[15459.05s -> 15461.05s]  um, okay weird
[15461.61s -> 15463.61s]  Why you're almost through the wave
[15464.97s -> 15477.99s]  I'm trying to go up trying to go through it. I don't have any fuel shit. That's why
[15478.95s -> 15482.73s]  That's all right. He can do it. He's played warframe before
[15488.09s -> 15490.09s]  Very good. Very good job. Very good
[15492.09s -> 15500.34s]  He turned around
[15511.59s -> 15513.59s]  Good
[15513.83s -> 15516.23s]  Where is the aforementioned supply pod?
[15516.39s -> 15519.51s]  What there is not a supply pod, I don't think
[15524.38s -> 15525.74s]  There it is
[15525.74s -> 15527.42s]  Where is it down?
[15527.42s -> 15529.42s]  All we have to do now is leave
[15530.90s -> 15532.90s]  Oh, I have zero bullets. So
[15534.01s -> 15536.01s]  Let's get some bullets excellent
[15538.68s -> 15540.68s]  Eggs excellent get it
[15541.48s -> 15543.48s]  egg
[15544.28s -> 15546.28s]  Egg
[15548.39s -> 15550.39s]  Egg there we go. That was better
[15550.47s -> 15553.59s]  Kind of hybrid everyone's right here. So we don't even have to go far
[15558.82s -> 15561.78s]  Stuart can you tell italics that he's the sexiest dreamer here for me
[15563.22s -> 15564.36s]  Wow
[15564.36s -> 15566.36s]  I mean, I already knew that but it still helps to hear
[15569.64s -> 15573.45s]  Uh, that was my mom. It's bullshit, by the way
[15579.50s -> 15589.54s]  I thought star's the only one up there
[15591.27s -> 15592.71s]  I was
[15592.71s -> 15595.27s]  He's just kind of we're just like playing
[15596.07s -> 15598.07s]  Hide and go seek down here
[15598.23s -> 15607.11s]  I think what's actually happening is we're all relying on someone else to lead so we can follow and read chat
[15607.99s -> 15610.68s]  So when all of us just read chat
[15611.08s -> 15615.40s]  We just walk in circles like we're talking on the phone. How many of the eggs did I deposit?
[15616.12s -> 15618.18s]  two
[15618.18s -> 15620.66s]  Fuck you. I'm seeing two. I'm seeing a bunch of twos. I'm seeing
[15621.94s -> 15626.66s]  I'm seeing a bunch of twos. Everyone in chat is running you put in like plus two you did two
[15627.86s -> 15634.28s]  He definitely gives one look at my chat. That's my chat is all saying six out of six
[15634.84s -> 15636.84s]  I don't know, but I don't think so
[15637.94s -> 15640.82s]  I don't think so
[15645.94s -> 15647.94s]  I just figured out what you're doing
[15650.02s -> 15655.53s]  Sir was trying to kill me like i'm just standing there letting him shoot me because i'm that kind of guy
[15656.41s -> 15658.65s]  And he's trying to kill me before I get in the pot
