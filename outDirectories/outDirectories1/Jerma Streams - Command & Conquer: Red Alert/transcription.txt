[1.85s -> 12.34s]  Good evening. Good early evening. How are you? Oh dude, Minecraft? Today? No.
[14.06s -> 17.98s]  I did the reason why we start in a couple hours later is because I was actually in a call
[18.86s -> 22.15s]  and we were talking about all kinds of things for the Minecraft
[22.87s -> 29.45s]  uh fuck the king server. That is yes still slated for the 15th. Has not been pushed. It's still
[29.45s -> 42.36s]  going. Uh it's it's gonna be I can't wait. I will have complete and full details on how that stream
[42.36s -> 52.10s]  is going to work tomorrow. Tomorrow after the game awards we're gonna sit here and I'm gonna open up
[52.10s -> 65.00s]  paint and we're going to go over how it's gonna work. If you have no idea what I'm talking about
[66.92s -> 73.00s]  then check the stream tomorrow night because that's going to be half game awards and then
[73.00s -> 83.64s]  uh half fuck the king explanation. So I'm a little excited because not only are we doing
[83.64s -> 92.71s]  fuck the king this coming uh 15th. I'm also about to play right now uh one of my favorite games
[94.02s -> 103.90s]  and I got it's working. It works perfectly fine. I'm ready to rock and roll. We're gonna play
[103.90s -> 109.69s]  red alert today. What's gonna do the campaign? I you know what I don't think I've ever even
[109.69s -> 115.37s]  done the campaign. I think I did the first like two missions and I gave up. This is like 15 years
[115.37s -> 127.53s]  ago. The campaign is really good. I know. I know. So that's what we're gonna do today and maybe now
[127.53s -> 133.13s]  at this time maybe I'll do like a skirmish where I really test my skills against like a good computer.
[133.93s -> 141.72s]  There's multiplayer that you can do but I want to do that with I want to set that up
[142.44s -> 147.16s]  with like subs or mods or other streamers because that's more fun that way than just
[148.12s -> 158.01s]  kind of detonating all the community servers that exist. We'll see if I still am into this after
[158.01s -> 166.98s]  today then maybe we'll open up some multiplayer stuff with actual multiplayer people. You should
[166.98s -> 171.06s]  do it with Joel so he can pretend to like it even though he hates it. I don't think you can
[171.06s -> 182.02s]  pretend to like red alert. I think you just like red alert. I dedicated my english project video
[182.02s -> 195.59s]  to you. Hey thanks. Did you make me look good? All right. Are you ready? Are you ready to see
[195.59s -> 216.62s]  my childhood? I am. Take a look. There it is. Red alert and it's all I got everything. There's no
[216.62s -> 223.46s]  sound. Now there should be. There will be. They're going to remaster it. Well we don't have time for
[223.46s -> 235.83s]  remasters. We play original hardware. Why is there no audio? Is there actually no audio?
[235.83s -> 245.37s]  Is it so low that you can't hear it? That's weird. All right you ready? This is by the way if you
[245.37s -> 250.58s]  don't know what uh red alert is it's the best rts that's ever been made. What about warcraft
[250.58s -> 257.50s]  2? No no no. Sit down. What about warcraft 3? Sit down. What about the original command and
[257.66s -> 262.66s]  sit down? What about red alert 2? You could. All right hold on. You don't have to sit down
[262.66s -> 270.02s]  but I don't want you to stand and interrupt my broadcast. Uh what about a warhammer 40k?
[270.02s -> 275.86s]  Dawn of war. The original dawn of war. All right you can you can come up and stand here with me
[275.86s -> 281.72s]  because that's the only other one that deserves to be there. How hard is this game though?
[288.36s -> 292.12s]  That's a lot of people. This game's very hard isn't it? All right let's go.
[293.35s -> 305.59s]  Oh what do I want to be allies or soviets? I've got to be the allies. Allied headquarters
[305.59s -> 316.58s]  present day. Good thing I turned it down. Commander. So last transmission? All 900 hours.
[316.58s -> 321.62s]  Since then nothing. Perhaps Einstein escaped. Too much to hope for general. He would have contacted
[321.62s -> 328.18s]  us by now. This is classified. I know. I sent for her. General von Essling. She is a civilian.
[328.18s -> 335.80s]  That's why I don't get killed. Commander this is Tanya Adams a professional volunteer. She has the
[335.80s -> 342.90s]  best voice lines. She will work with you on this mission. Somewhere inside this research center
[342.90s -> 350.42s]  the soviets hold Albert Einstein. We need him back immediately. Get Tanya inside so she can get
[350.42s -> 356.50s]  Einstein out. Once you have located him bring him back to your drop-off point for immediate
[356.50s -> 363.64s]  evacuation. Be careful. The base is heavily fortified but not invincible. Their weakness
[363.64s -> 375.53s]  is power. Black out the base and nothing will stop you. Good luck. That's just, that's Tanya.
[376.25s -> 385.35s]  That's the best line in the whole game. We gotta go get Einstein. Here we go.
[386.15s -> 400.55s]  Oh I can feel the nostalgia. There it is. All right, all right. Hold it. Let's, let's go this
[400.55s -> 405.27s]  way. Holy shit. It's like the blood's rushing to my face right now. I'm so happy to be playing this.
[405.99s -> 411.96s]  Affirmative. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No. Well and back up, back up. I gotta, I gotta do this
[411.96s -> 421.82s]  correct. Why is the music so low? Hold on. Game controls. No, no, no. I want to keep that note.
[421.82s -> 427.74s]  Sound controls. There it is. Let's drop this. Let's raise this. There you go. Now we're, now it's normal.
[429.24s -> 434.97s]  That's better. Okay let's go. Here we go. So Tanya, if you don't know, Tanya instantly destroys
[434.97s -> 453.00s]  buildings that she walks into. Yes sir. Take out their resources. Don't get run over. Don't get
[453.00s -> 462.74s]  run over. Okay, I lost a lot of people. I gotta take out their power. Oh shit. This is harder than
[462.74s -> 485.72s]  I thought it was gonna be. How do we get it? Where's Tanya? Okay, Tanya. All right, let's go.
[487.16s -> 497.38s]  Get in. Wait, how do you attack move? How do you attack move? I don't know. Take out the power. Take out
[497.38s -> 506.54s]  the power. Is it A? No, it's not A. Control is to target individual. Okay, take out the power.
[507.83s -> 519.82s]  Easy Tanya. Don't get killed. All right, the power is gone. Take out their tech center. Got it. What?
[519.82s -> 537.83s]  Oh, I just, okay, I killed Einstein. All right, let's go. Take out the buckets. Please turn the
[537.83s -> 552.44s]  music. I'm gonna turn music up and turn volume down. Take out the power. All right, this is very hard.
[552.44s -> 558.84s]  Okay, hold on. I don't, this is why I didn't ever play the actual video game because it's very hard
[558.84s -> 574.63s]  to do. All right, I gotta, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. All right, I want two different
[574.63s -> 581.58s]  groups. You're group one. Group one, I want you to go take out this. Group two, I want you to take out
[581.58s -> 595.85s]  the stuff in the base. Group one. Group two. Group two, take out guys on the right. All right, don't
[595.85s -> 605.93s]  destroy the base. All right, back up, back up, back up. Is that enough? Okay, now I can take a
[605.93s -> 617.91s]  sec. Wake up reinforcements. Don't destroy the tech center. All right, here we go. I gotta think
[617.91s -> 623.00s]  this through. They're, I gotta take out their power. We're gonna wrap around. Let's take everybody
[623.00s -> 636.17s]  over here. Is this still powered? Take it out. Take this shit out. Kill their resources. All right,
[636.17s -> 646.76s]  take out their base. Destroy the whole thing. Yeah, yeah, we took the power. This is good.
[648.18s -> 652.34s]  All right, I just had to avoid. I don't want to, Tonya can't die. And neither can Einstein.
[653.30s -> 663.46s]  If Tonya touches a building, it instantly explodes.
[664.18s -> 683.30s]  All right, I'm good. I love this game. Get Einstein to the helicopter. That's Einstein.
[684.02s -> 697.34s]  All right, we got it. I did it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
[708.31s -> 726.36s]  Why did they destroy the building? I don't even know how to, how do you attack move?
[727.00s -> 748.28s]  All right, let's do it again. It's not A. All right, just get in there. No, it's not A. All right,
[748.28s -> 761.90s]  let's go. I got him, right? You select and you right click. All right, we did it. I got Einstein.
[762.86s -> 773.06s]  All right, that wasn't so hard. What's going on over here? Oh shit.
[774.02s -> 777.02s]  Where were these guys before? Okay, that was very easy.
[784.20s -> 802.76s]  I got full motion loud cutscenes. Great. All right, only, all right, I had, they had more
[802.76s -> 811.18s]  casualties than me. Therefore, I win. I'm going to turn the base volume down and then turn it up.
[819.48s -> 824.76s]  Soviet aggression has increased tenfold already. We don't have the manpower to fight Stalin's
[824.76s -> 832.89s]  armies on every front. Commander, you did a fine job rescuing Einstein for us. Now,
[833.61s -> 839.24s]  we are counting on you again. One of the passes we use for a supply route has been blocked by the
[839.24s -> 846.04s]  Reds. A convoy from the 434th is due through in a matter of hours. The supplies they carry
[846.68s -> 852.84s]  are critical to our war efforts. That's not a belt. What we have in that area to work with.
[852.84s -> 858.81s]  That's a power lifter support. And time is against us. You will have to make do.
[859.69s -> 865.94s]  You wear that to a bench press. So the convoy can get to safety. Their lives rest in your hands.
[866.74s -> 875.85s]  Go. Here's the best part. Here's the best part. Here's the best part. Here comes the best part.
[876.81s -> 883.61s]  Wait, clear the way for the convoy. Yes, sir. All right. I like to play a little bit slower. No,
[883.61s -> 898.17s]  I don't. I got a mess of a volume here. That's, that's probably better. Take a look at this.
[898.17s -> 903.21s]  But you didn't, you know what? They all watch this. Ready? Bang. Power plant immediately. Oh,
[903.21s -> 909.29s]  also some people are probably going to realize. Where's the guy? Where's the guy talking? Where's
[909.29s -> 918.12s]  the guy? Uh, I deleted him from the game. I literally, I literally modded the game to remove
[918.12s -> 925.46s]  that guy talking. Building unit, ready unit, lost unit, ready building unit, ready unit,
[925.46s -> 933.13s]  lost unit, lost unit, lost unit, lost. I know I modded them out of the game. All right. Oh,
[933.13s -> 939.42s]  we got, I got a oil refinery. Let's go. Let's start clearing. I don't even need two groups.
[940.22s -> 952.55s]  All right. Go down here. Wait, I'm going to leave a Jeep here. You stay up there.
[953.51s -> 967.82s]  Shoot him. If this guy throws a grenade and kills you, I'd be so mad. The one DB music is good.
[968.86s -> 980.76s]  All right. I, what is attack move? That's attack point. Let's get that down.
[981.88s -> 992.15s]  Oh, they're really, oh, I got a time limit here. A click. It's not though. It's not,
[992.15s -> 1001.18s]  it's not doing it. Yes, it is. No, it's not. Attack move. No, it's not. This game was made
[1001.26s -> 1014.34s]  before attack move was invented. No, no, it was not. All right. We have a, I need an
[1014.34s -> 1018.89s]  engineer to repair that Jeep. How are we doing? How are we doing over here? Good, good, good,
[1018.89s -> 1024.17s]  good, good. We need barracks. No, you guys stay, just stay. And this is like a way you can do like
[1024.17s -> 1034.06s]  a guard, can't you? My base is not dying. It's fine. I don't think we can get through this.
[1036.22s -> 1040.06s]  You don't have any engineers. Clear the way for the convoy.
[1041.02s -> 1047.16s]  There's dogs. All right. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Don't go up there. You idiot.
[1050.31s -> 1056.31s]  The base is right up here. All right. What's going to, I just want a ton of rocket soldiers.
[1057.83s -> 1067.72s]  You guys go this way. Actually don't kill dogs. What do you, I can't help that. Can I do it?
[1073.42s -> 1078.55s]  I know this is the dog house, but it's important. It's a strategic location. Oh,
[1078.55s -> 1090.78s]  shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Don't be an idiot. More, more soldiers.
[1091.50s -> 1105.50s]  Psycho streamer can't help itself. What? This is clear. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Move in,
[1105.50s -> 1125.24s]  move in. Go, go, go, go, go. Take the whole thing up. Over the base. No, just keep rocket
[1125.24s -> 1141.62s]  soldiers coming. They're the best. Construction yard going down. My base is fine. There's nothing.
[1142.26s -> 1155.91s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out. Oh, that guy died. Run him over.
[1163.30s -> 1167.91s]  All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Who's still alive?
[1169.40s -> 1182.01s]  Convoy approaching. Oh, I did it. I got it. Oh, that, that's my, okay. Get in the convoy.
[1183.05s -> 1188.28s]  They just have to be protected. Nice. All right. I got it. Loud, uh, full motion,
[1188.28s -> 1196.84s]  loud video coming soon. This is the best track on the whole entire soundtrack, by the way.
[1197.40s -> 1215.50s]  They're just going to make it all the way up and that's good. We can't hear it. Hold on.
[1219.30s -> 1222.65s]  Yeah, but now it's like, now my, now it's hurting my ears.
[1229.10s -> 1237.66s]  Hold on. I got to turn it down for me. It's too loud for me. Good. No, not good. All right. How's
[1237.66s -> 1250.81s]  that? I can do, I can deal with that. That's good for me. All right. Mission two complete. I've,
[1250.81s -> 1270.73s]  so this is, I love this. It's all coming back to me. Loud. It needs to drown out your voice. Why?
[1271.85s -> 1284.55s]  Command and Conquer generals was better. I don't think so. Just wait till I do a skirmish again
[1284.55s -> 1292.74s]  with like two, like three V three. It's going to be nuts. Wait, so let me just say I'm rooting
[1292.74s -> 1309.29s]  for the Soviets. Well, all right, which one up or down? Let's go down. It's a nice bridge.
[1310.17s -> 1315.21s]  Intelligence recon shows heavy Soviet movement in your area. Nearby bridges are key to Soviet
[1315.21s -> 1321.53s]  advancement. Destroy all bridges as soon as possible. Tanya will assist keep her alive at
[1321.53s -> 1342.23s]  all costs. Destroy the bridges. Tanya has to stay alive. How are we doing? Okay. This is
[1342.47s -> 1356.06s]  over here. I instantly killed that guy. Don't go, don't go and just guns blazing. I got to
[1356.06s -> 1366.84s]  have a strategy here. Shoot the barrel. Oh no, it's going to like press an alert. No, it's not. I'm
[1366.84s -> 1383.70s]  fine. Wait, who just came out of there? Is it a medic? Oh, fuck yeah. Why can't Tanya be in
[1383.70s -> 1398.66s]  Smash Brothers? Just one guy over here. Get used to those sounds because that's all the sounds
[1398.66s -> 1403.46s]  you're going to hear for the rest of the time that I play this. And you wanted me to have
[1404.42s -> 1409.70s]  the unit lost. Every time a unit dies in red alert, that guy says that somebody died.
[1411.00s -> 1422.49s]  Unit lost. Let's rock. Unit lost. Affirmative. Unit lost. Oops. I just fucking murdered the medic.
[1422.49s -> 1427.85s]  It's okay. It's still doable. It's still doable. I didn't know he was going to.
[1430.39s -> 1434.25s]  All right, watch out. This is flamethrower turrets.
[1450.18s -> 1460.66s]  I think I get this. This is mine. It's not mine. I can't pick this up. Come on. This is mine,
[1460.66s -> 1484.52s]  right? Why can't I get it? I'm taking it slow because I don't want to walk into.
[1485.32s -> 1498.18s]  Why is this following me now? What's going on? There's three tanks over here.
[1498.98s -> 1511.91s]  I have to shoot the barrel. Nice. All right. Hey, well actually that's good. That works out for me.
[1511.91s -> 1520.86s]  I'm okay with that. Somebody said no cha-ching in like 10 seconds. Sad. I don't walk over here.
[1520.86s -> 1530.30s]  I'll burn instantly. Save the game right there. I wonder if I should go down. Wait, take out the
[1530.30s -> 1537.74s]  bridge first. Uh oh. What is that? Don't let him land. Don't let him land. Don't let him land.
[1538.62s -> 1549.59s]  What's down here? Any reinforcements? Any medics? Any friends? Here we go.
[1549.91s -> 1559.18s]  Crate. That's a crate. Crate. Give me the crate. Give me the crate. Crate. There's an item in it
[1559.18s -> 1564.30s]  or something in it. You can get like extra items and stuff. All right. Let's kill this guy. Don't
[1564.30s -> 1579.29s]  aggro everybody. Money. Wait a minute. Oh shit. I got four engineers.
[1587.02s -> 1590.78s]  All right. Stay here. Tanya has to take all four of these guys out.
[1592.54s -> 1600.44s]  Unbelievable. Good work. All right. Let's go. Now where do I go from here? Up this way.
[1607.93s -> 1613.37s]  Don't blow up the bridge again. No. Don't worry. I'm not going to kill anybody. We're just going
[1613.37s -> 1625.90s]  to go slow. There's a medic up there. All right. I don't want to kill this. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh
[1625.90s -> 1636.04s]  shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Watch out for the grenade. He's hurt. Come on. Get over here. Heal us. Heal.
[1637.80s -> 1651.45s]  Nice. Do it again. Now do it to yourself. Do it to yourself. Oh fuck it. Whatever. All right.
[1651.45s -> 1661.05s]  No, no, no. Not everybody walk in. Tanya just goes. No one will die. No, this goes self-heal
[1661.05s -> 1678.26s]  unfortunately. All right. Tanya Goker. Wait. What was that? Wait. What happened? What was
[1678.90s -> 1692.95s]  that? Uh oh. What was there? Any more bridges? There's like a naval base over here.
[1697.22s -> 1706.33s]  All right. Everyone get out of the way. We're going to take this thing out. How do I? Oh,
[1706.33s -> 1714.44s]  we have to go across. Okay. So these turn up the in-game voices. I'm not going to turn the in-game
[1714.44s -> 1745.45s]  voice up. How am I going to do this? I think I'm screwed. Tanya's dead if she walked in there.
[1750.58s -> 1774.79s]  Is it my softlocks? Hold on. It's still a kill. That's all right. I have a save point right here.
[1778.41s -> 1790.49s]  Good. All right. Don't blow that up. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,
[1790.49s -> 1806.14s]  kill. Too late. I was too late. I do want to get. Where are the engineers? Oh, fuck.
[1806.70s -> 1816.20s]  I have to get these engineers. Where's the music? This is weird without the music.
[1822.66s -> 1824.26s]  It's strange without music.
[1838.10s -> 1847.56s]  Okay. Save it here. My nostalgia. I know. Really. It's true.
[1847.72s -> 1857.75s]  Let's rock. Let's rock. This feels dark without the music. What do you mean dark?
[1868.20s -> 1874.36s]  I'm there. I'm there. Let's rock. Let's rock. And I am doing it wrong actually. It's let's rock.
[1875.00s -> 1895.91s]  Let's rock. Let's rock. Let's rock. Let's rock. All right. Heal yourself.
[1899.99s -> 1908.09s]  Save it here. Good. We're still safe. Let's rock. Let's rock. Take this shit out. We can move across.
[1912.10s -> 1919.54s]  He's scumming. Medic reporting. Let's rock. Yes, sir. I'm there.
[1919.54s -> 1929.99s]  Don't blow it up. Just go across it. I'm there. Don't trigger this. When we get across,
[1929.99s -> 1935.34s]  blow up the bridge. But then we can't ever come back. All right. We're going to have an
[1935.34s -> 1948.44s]  engineer go out and scout. We're good? All right. You go forward. Test for the landmines.
[1956.60s -> 1967.70s]  Okay. Here we are. Good. Yes, sir. I'm not having any fun. Medic reporting. I don't like this.
[1971.45s -> 1976.74s]  All right. We're going to take this out. The engineers can repair buildings. I think they
[1976.74s -> 1983.94s]  can take them over too. Can they? Don't blow up. Do not blow the bridge up.
[1983.94s -> 1995.30s]  Do not blow the bridge up. Stay here. Snipe. All right. Get across. Yes, sir. Affirmative.
[1995.30s -> 2005.99s]  Affirmative. Chew on this. Chew on this. Affirmative. What's up? I'm there. Okay.
[2005.99s -> 2014.47s]  Slowly. Okay. I'm going to blow this up from a safe distance. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Yes, sir.
[2014.47s -> 2021.14s]  Oh, shit. Is that destroyed? No, it's not. Okay. Thank God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Run. Run. No,
[2021.14s -> 2037.32s]  don't run. We're good. Wait. I think I just did it. I did it. That's it, right? Yes. Okay. We're
[2037.32s -> 2073.66s]  good. Well, that would have sucked. Turn your volume down. Unit lost. The only reason why you
[2073.66s -> 2080.14s]  have that guy enabled is for A-bomb launch detected. A-bomb launch charging. A-bomb launch
[2080.14s -> 2086.60s]  detected. That's the reason why you have that guy enabled, but I couldn't. I just modded him out
[2086.60s -> 2098.92s]  again. All right. Any more? We got another one opened up right here. Oh, commander. We didn't see
[2098.92s -> 2107.00s]  you there. Oh, there you are. Commander, I wish I could say I had good news, but not all of our
[2107.00s -> 2118.18s]  battles fared as well as yours. The Greek front is collapsing and Germany is all but taken. However,
[2119.00s -> 2126.14s]  not all is lost. Your efforts have hampered Soviet progress in this area. The bridges you destroyed
[2126.14s -> 2132.22s]  have caused the Soviets to redirect their forces through a certain mountain pass that I believe
[2132.22s -> 2138.74s]  you are familiar with. They are gambling that you will not be able to stop them a second time.
[2138.74s -> 2145.43s]  We got enough screens in this room. Prove them wrong, Stavros. Expect a heavy concentration
[2145.43s -> 2150.79s]  of Soviet armor. The base you established is still standing. Get it up to speed as quickly
[2150.79s -> 2156.31s]  as possible. We're counting on you to keep the Reds from breaking through. Fake German accent.
[2166.79s -> 2174.79s]  We are going to stop them from breaking through. Cut. Hey, can I get a water, please? My throat is
[2174.79s -> 2189.43s]  fucking killing me. Can I have a water? Reporting. Destroy all Soviet units and structures. Let's go.
[2190.79s -> 2194.39s]  Very well. Shoot her out of the air. Acknowledged. All right. I need a...
[2194.39s -> 2199.27s]  What are they doing? I don't like this. Okay. Oh, shit. I got people down here. All right. Wait,
[2199.67s -> 2203.27s]  we got people everywhere. There's one guy up here. We got to get this guy back.
[2204.71s -> 2206.95s]  This fighting. I don't know where the fighting is happening.
[2208.79s -> 2223.96s]  We need to get back. Get back. One guy. Oh, fuck. That's my base. That's my base they're destroying.
[2223.96s -> 2241.50s]  I thought it was... What? I was just laying mines? Okay. Don't let them just go over here.
[2242.14s -> 2253.67s]  Reporting. Very well. Get to work. I need a new one. Kill him. All right. You... I just
[2253.67s -> 2259.03s]  dropped two mines for no reason. Yes, sir. Acknowledged. They're just going to keep coming.
[2259.03s -> 2267.34s]  All right. Put a mine down. Acknowledged. Why is it not going off? Wait, what? Yes, sir.
[2267.90s -> 2287.27s]  This guy's crop dusting me. All right. This is where it really begins. Okay. Give me a medic
[2287.27s -> 2297.72s]  and I get oil refinery. Come on. Hurry up. Yes, sir. Where's their base? I don't know.
[2299.62s -> 2303.38s]  All right. Back to work. You can do it now. Go on. And I got another. I got two of these now.
[2304.42s -> 2312.63s]  Pillbox. Go. Two medics. Yes, sir. Moving out. Ready and waiting. I want a medic with each group.
[2314.78s -> 2323.18s]  What's my APM? Probably four. Two pill boxes up top. No, I don't have enough money for this shit.
[2323.18s -> 2330.58s]  What's going on? Yes, sir. There we go. All right. I need... The rocket guys can shoot up there.

[2403.88s -> 2406.76s]  This is all I can build right now. So we're going to do two barracks. You're probably asking,
[2406.76s -> 2411.72s]  what are you pretty stupid? No. The more of anything you have, the sub tier under it will
[2411.72s -> 2415.16s]  go double as fast. I've already checked this out. Rocket soldier. Look at how quick this is going.
[2415.16s -> 2423.00s]  Now check that out. All right. I'm almost out of money. Acknowledged. All right. We're going

[2442.73s -> 2444.41s]  I'm going to say the tanks will be coming from down here.
[2445.69s -> 2450.65s]  So that's a turret. It's better for tanks. This is team one. They're going to stay up. Oh,
[2451.37s -> 2460.49s]  look at me. I can do that instantly dead. Not even. Don't kill this.
[2462.25s -> 2467.30s]  I need engineers. I don't have any. Fuck. Okay. All right. All right. Where's team one?
[2468.34s -> 2480.41s]  You guys have to protect. Yes, sir. All right. Let's go. Team one. Stay in this area.

[2672.71s -> 2676.55s]  that only makes rocket guys and they get destroyed by regular infantry.

[2927.05s -> 2937.06s]  expensive though. The $2,000. I just need to get a couple more tanks. I would feel comfortable with

[3759.42s -> 3778.94s]  Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[3782.86s -> 3785.74s]  Don't cross the space path. Don't do that.
[3789.06s -> 3801.14s]  Thank god. Yes, sir. Kill them buildings. Just kill them buildings. It's over.
[3802.10s -> 3824.54s]  The germ is gaming hard right now. Yeah, I know. I gotta turn this down. This shit is so loud.
[3827.72s -> 3838.66s]  Okay, that's better. Did he just sell everything? Yes, sir. All right. This motherfucker is
[3838.66s -> 3841.78s]  seriously BMing me. He sold everything. Affirmative. He sold every building.
[3841.78s -> 3852.54s]  Very well. And you just left with a snowplow. Affirmative. Yes, sir. At once. Affirmative.
[3852.54s -> 3860.76s]  Is that actually all that you have left? Affirmative. Here it comes. The final battle.
[3860.76s -> 3877.67s]  Ready and waiting. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. This is the last line of defense in the war.
[3878.39s -> 3890.73s]  You know you're in the snowplow. Like, what do you do? Snowplow BM. Yeah, I know. What the fuck?
[3901.18s -> 3908.04s]  I guess I did that.
[3914.98s -> 3932.47s]  This game. I love this game. 157 to 120. What building did I lose? I lost a building?
[3937.19s -> 3945.86s]  This one's into, we're going into Russia. Not quite. Let's go. Let's go up here.
[3945.86s -> 3951.14s]  Government leaders have abandoned the capital and are now hiding in exile. Information out of
[3951.14s -> 3956.34s]  occupied Athens has been sporadic, but Soviet forces are indeed in control of the capital,
[3956.34s -> 3961.94s]  as well as much of the outlying territories in Greece. In the city, fighting among allied
[3961.94s -> 3967.62s]  and Soviet troops continues, but the allied death toll is rising rapidly. Now it remains to be seen
[3967.62s -> 3972.10s]  if allied forces will be able to weather this onslaught intact. What the fuck? Reacting to
[3972.10s -> 3979.22s]  this latest assault, allied diplomats led the United Nations in a 281 to 7 vote that in approving
[3979.22s -> 3985.38s]  a unique military funding initiative aimed at increasing global allied support. This proposal
[3985.38s -> 3990.58s]  calls for the formation of a global defense agency to be temporarily established in an
[3991.30s -> 4003.80s]  unnamed European capital. Sounds bad, does it not? Well, it is, but Stalin has just written his
[4003.80s -> 4011.32s]  obituary. At last, this will help us galvanize the rest of the world against him. Yes, we have lost
[4011.32s -> 4018.28s]  Greece, but we are not out just yet. We've lost Greece. Stalin may think so, but if we can continue
[4018.28s -> 4023.32s]  to counsel the talents of commanders like yourself, we will come to this war on top.
[4024.04s -> 4037.02s]  My old friend, one of Tanya's men, she found something. Russian security agents have captured
[4037.02s -> 4046.09s]  her. They will almost certainly take her back to Moscow. They must get her back. She has vital
[4046.09s -> 4050.01s]  information on the Ion Breton project. Did you hear when he put it down? That information could
[4050.01s -> 4060.65s]  help tip the scales in our favor. Let him clear his head. In this state, he is of no use to us.
[4064.38s -> 4071.32s]  The Soviets currently hold Tanya near Grodno. The prison is well guarded with a supply truck from
[4071.32s -> 4078.33s]  a nearby Soviet base, runs through the facility several times a day. If your spies can infiltrate
[4078.33s -> 4085.42s]  the war factory, they may be able to hitch a ride into the prison compound. Once you have found Tanya,
[4086.70s -> 4109.13s]  get her out of there, any way you can. Such a pretty face. Where is Professor Einstein?
[4110.01s -> 4131.03s]  That was a real spin. I was hoping you'd say that. Oh, fuck. Oh, it's a syringe. What,
[4131.03s -> 4141.56s]  what is it blood? What is that syringe? It has to be a syringe in every game.
[4145.18s -> 4164.66s]  I'm afraid the effects are quite permanent. Oh, get it away from the eye. Oh, I hate this. Oh,
[4164.66s -> 4181.85s]  I hate this. Oh, is he stuck in his chest? Wait, wait, what?
[4186.42s -> 4193.98s]  Let's go get spy into the war factory. War factory over here.
[4200.50s -> 4207.94s]  The dogs can see through. Oh shit. Oh shit, a dog is chasing me. The dogs can see through
[4207.94s -> 4230.31s]  your disguise. I remember. All right, get out of the way. Got to get in here. Watch out for that
[4230.31s -> 4235.35s]  dog. Watch out for that dog. Watch out for that dog. Watch out for that dog. Watch out for the dog.
[4236.87s -> 4260.28s]  What? Didn't I just die? Didn't, what about, didn't that guy just die?
[4277.50s -> 4282.15s]  All right, I gotta wait. I gotta go like now, but I can't. I gotta wait. This is Hitman.
[4282.15s -> 4288.63s]  I gotta play it like Hitman. Okay, there they go. They're going to come up here. How far out do
[4288.63s -> 4316.71s]  these guys go? Maybe I should go down. They're not going to see me, right? I'm going down. Look
[4316.71s -> 4319.43s]  at that mammoth tank. That's the best, that's the best unit in the whole game, by the way.
[4329.27s -> 4334.94s]  All right, don't, I'm not, just stay here. Just stay, stay right here. They come up,
[4334.94s -> 4337.34s]  they come down, then they go this way and I'm going to go over here.
[4338.44s -> 4349.53s]  Save it right here. All right, I'm ready. Up and then they come back down. Hide up here.
[4351.69s -> 4358.44s]  Stay right there. They don't, please don't see me. Right? I'm far enough away. Okay.
[4359.32s -> 4364.07s]  Don't move. They go down. Okay, they go down there.
[4364.07s -> 4391.93s]  Get in there. I'm in. Now what? Oh, I'm in the convoy. Oh, shit. Save it here.
[4392.65s -> 4417.91s]  This base is huge. Christ. Get Tanya to the helicopter.
[4420.15s -> 4438.74s]  Destroy the SAM sites. Let's go. Tanya? What happened to the spy? Oh no, the spy is dead.
[4439.46s -> 4456.31s]  Destroy the SAM sites. Get Tanya to the helicopter. And he gave, it gave his life.
[4457.11s -> 4460.62s]  All right, I gotta be careful. The dogs can kill you in instant one hit. So
[4461.82s -> 4480.12s]  there's another dog. Not so far so good. Helicopters. I don't even know where it is.
[4486.49s -> 4498.92s]  Hold up. Shoot. What the fuck? It was obvious. He was a red spy.
[4499.80s -> 4523.70s]  That's very good use of what he just said. Oh shit. Is that me? I'm getting reinforcements.
[4524.98s -> 4541.05s]  No, that, just get in the helicopter. Did I do it? Destroy all units and structures.
[4547.61s -> 4554.95s]  How the hell am I going to do this? I don't even need a construction site?
[4558.25s -> 4560.73s]  All right, I have to get an engineer into their construction site here.
[4567.10s -> 4575.08s]  This is gonna be fucked up. All right, I need to, we gotta do some group dictates and stuff here.
[4576.52s -> 4586.49s]  I want tanks on group one and I want jeeps and people on group two. Group one. Get you guys on
[4586.49s -> 4593.61s]  group two. All right, group one goes in first. That's a mammoth tank.
[4593.61s -> 4600.17s]  Let's try to take it out before I can do anything. Kill that mammoth tank.
[4600.97s -> 4619.05s]  Oh fuck. Kill it. Stay away. Stay away. Stay away. Only group one. They got dogs.
[4625.14s -> 4629.62s]  All right, engineer. Get in there. Take over the base and then I'll have a construction site.
[4630.18s -> 4637.45s]  If you get an engineer in any building, they take it over. That's not true. That's not true at all.
[4641.03s -> 4648.17s]  Oh right, right. You have to damage it. You have to damage it all the way.
[4648.17s -> 4656.95s]  Okay, whatever. We lost him. It has to be all the way on this damage. He's fixing it from the inside.
[4656.95s -> 4677.11s]  What are you doing? Stop it. Now it's ours. Okay, now I'll fix that. There we go. Now I own this shit.
[4679.45s -> 4689.59s]  Okay, I whoops. Okay, whoops. That was a whoops. I didn't capture the war factory. That was a mistake.
[4689.59s -> 4704.50s]  It's okay. I'm gonna make a sub pen. Shit, this is bad. What are you doing? Don't destroy your own
[4704.50s -> 4727.72s]  fence, you idiot. Don't. Actually, don't. Take out there. Take this up. Dog. Nobody get yourself
[4727.72s -> 4740.84s]  killed, please. Sub pens going in here and then I can probably go around. We'll find out. Warfare.
[4740.84s -> 4754.86s]  Sub pen. Let's do it. I need an engineer. I wonder if I can make engineers. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[4757.38s -> 4770.44s]  Get out. Affirmative. Affirmative. All right, let's do a submarine. Wait a minute. Hold on.
[4772.86s -> 4785.77s]  Does the water go down here? Stay up here. Stay up here. Don't go down that way. Did I just waste
[4785.77s -> 4799.48s]  like a thousand? I think I just wasted a bunch of money. No, it's good. It goes. Yeah, I wasted
[4799.48s -> 4811.06s]  a bunch of money. Oh well. Oh well. Barracks. Let's get this ready. Let's do this like down here.
[4812.02s -> 4818.78s]  Engineer. Here we go. This stuff is all mine now. All mine. In fact, get everybody out of the way
[4818.78s -> 4846.47s]  and blow this up. Sell it. Destroy everything. I will. Did you seriously kill him? No. No.
[4851.74s -> 4857.53s]  It didn't hit him? All right, I need to repair you. Come here. How do we repair?
[4857.53s -> 4863.37s]  Come here. Did the fucking service depot just exploded? God damn it.
[4866.01s -> 4878.39s]  Oh shit. They're coming in. I think I'm gonna lose. I think he's gonna lose. I'm gonna lose. Oh my
[4878.39s -> 4892.34s]  God. No. No. When did I last save it? When did I save it? God damn it. When did I save it? Just
[4892.34s -> 4898.04s]  load it. I don't care. Okay. Yeah. What a disaster that was. We're not fucking doing that.
[4898.52s -> 4921.26s]  Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. Affirmative. Let's kill the tank. Get out of there,
[4921.26s -> 4933.35s]  Engineer. You seriously can't hit the dog. How bad are you guys? All right, we're good. Now.
[4934.87s -> 4942.74s]  Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Kill the dogs. Kill the dogs. Kill the dogs. Kill the dogs.
[4946.57s -> 4984.39s]  Don't turn yellow. Don't turn yellow. Don't turn yellow. Good. Why are the engineers on the front
[4984.39s -> 4995.53s]  line? I don't know. But I have to get them out quick now. Engineer. Hurry up so I can get this
[4995.53s -> 5008.33s]  done. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's take the service depot first. Oh my God.
[5008.33s -> 5014.98s]  I didn't think it was gonna destroy the whole thing. It did get killed instantly. I thought
[5014.98s -> 5041.86s]  I was gonna at least... There was three barrels. Get in there. Stop shooting it. No,
[5041.86s -> 5052.01s]  fuck the ore refinery. Give me another barracks. Okay, I need engineers. Give me another barracks.
[5055.70s -> 5068.63s]  Capture the snowplow. I can't. Grenade? A Grenader. What's he doing? Get the fuck out of here.
[5069.03s -> 5079.06s]  Affirmative. Yes, sir. Knowledge. Get on the... Just defend. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Vehicle. Affirmative.
[5079.06s -> 5082.90s]  Give me another barracks. No, that's overkill. Super overkill. Yes, sir.
[5087.85s -> 5095.29s]  Stop. Stop. Don't go that far. What are you doing? Okay. Yes, sir. Affirmative.
[5105.26s -> 5116.10s]  Don't. Just go attack it. That's bad of you. Oh, yeah. You can repair. Right. Right. Right.
[5116.10s -> 5120.58s]  That's instant repair. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Yes, sir. I don't even want this one.
[5120.58s -> 5128.39s]  I'm not gonna take it over. I'll just replace it. It's probably cheaper for me to replace this.
[5142.26s -> 5170.74s]  Let's get dogs. I'm gonna get like 50 dogs. More. I need money. I need money. I need money. I need
[5171.38s -> 5188.78s]  I need money. Don't do that. I don't have refinery. Okay. That's so many dog kennels. So,
[5189.34s -> 5195.03s]  plan A is see if I can wrap around this way to take out... Because these Tesla coils,
[5195.03s -> 5203.90s]  the flame tower, it's gonna be a shit show. Affirmative. I still have... All right. We got
[5203.90s -> 5212.30s]  dogs. Okay. Plan B is go... Oh, they have those things. What is it? The V rockets.
[5214.90s -> 5218.18s]  Just go wrap Main Streets the other way. But that's a horrible idea. I'm gonna go...
[5219.30s -> 5222.49s]  You know what? The transport actually doesn't sound like such a terrible idea now.
[5223.05s -> 5226.49s]  Because I could just put people in them and then bring them down here without...
[5226.49s -> 5231.13s]  No, what a mistake that was. All right. This guy's almost dead. Go scout over here. See what's over
[5231.13s -> 5244.60s]  here. Go to these so you don't get killed. All right. Go this way. No, no, no, no, no.
[5245.24s -> 5258.98s]  I can... I can admit it here. I could just launch a... I'm going for it. He sees me. He sees me. Come
[5258.98s -> 5271.10s]  on. Get it done. Get it done. Yes. Mission complete. You did a good job. It's all right.
[5271.10s -> 5285.82s]  Here comes the retaliation. That's fine with me. Oh, fuck. Here come the rockets. Bad, bad, bad.
[5285.82s -> 5290.52s]  These things kill everything. Kill these before they do anything. Don't get too close.
[5297.72s -> 5307.91s]  Back it up. Okay. We're all right. Yes, sir. I gotta take off those fucking Tesla coils.
[5307.91s -> 5330.28s]  Of course. Agree. Kill it. Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back. I don't have the
[5330.28s -> 5338.60s]  power to do this. I gotta go around this way. In fact, you know what? Just get over here. Get
[5338.60s -> 5347.62s]  this way. Don't activate the Tesla coil. Just wrap around it. Because we're going down. These flame
[5347.62s -> 5361.66s]  towers are not as deadly as the Tesla coils. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Get in.
[5368.42s -> 5373.53s]  Oh, fuck. All the dogs just died. I didn't even realize they were here.
[5379.78s -> 5394.65s]  Where are you going? Just get across the bridge. What the fuck are you going? I think I'm gonna
[5394.65s -> 5423.75s]  go all the way around a long way. That should be good. We're good. Why did he explode?
[5423.75s -> 5431.80s]  Yes, sir. Stay in the base. These guys are just gonna be painting the ass.
[5432.68s -> 5449.96s]  It's all right. These guys are flamethrower troopers. Oh, shit. Yes, sir. All right. Slowly
[5449.96s -> 5456.28s]  take them out. Take out their resources. Take out their bullshit. Power. Focus on that first.
[5457.48s -> 5480.78s]  Out of money. All right. I did what I wanted to do. More power. Take it out. I got an ore
[5480.78s -> 5485.34s]  truck, right? Yes, sir. Get over there. Affirmative. Where's my other? Okay. Good.
[5485.34s -> 5488.94s]  You're good. You're good. You're good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Don't leave the base unguarded.
[5490.14s -> 5500.10s]  Okay. Good. I got to take out this thing, but I don't want to. These are all grenades. Fuck.
[5500.10s -> 5509.11s]  I have no money. How much is 1400 bucks? Give me another tank. Two tanks.
[5517.45s -> 5522.90s]  All right. The grenades are actually awesome. They have. Don't run them over.
[5523.62s -> 5528.71s]  Okay. Do they have enough power to use the Tesla coil? Hello. What the hell was that?
[5530.71s -> 5541.37s]  What's going on? All right. I need to do a test. Ready and waiting. No, don't do that. That's a bad
[5541.37s -> 5567.56s]  idea. What happened to the music? The lack of music. Who is being shot at down here? All right.
[5567.56s -> 5574.36s]  This is freaking me out. Oh, they have a plane. It's planes. They're just doing these. Oh,
[5574.36s -> 5591.46s]  that's not good. That's a pain in the ass. I need a. Give me a silo. No music makes it serious.
[5591.46s -> 5607.29s]  It is serious. No, they have power. Oh shit. That's bad. That's very bad. Kill it. Kill it
[5607.29s -> 5623.78s]  before it. I get it. We're doing tanks only. I need just only tanks. In fact, where are the
[5623.78s -> 5635.27s]  other resources down here? This shit. Get away from me. Oh, you fucking motherfucker. I'm so angry
[5635.27s -> 5644.18s]  at that. Only tanks. Tanks only. Let's go. Those anti-infantry things. All right. Keep going.
[5644.74s -> 5651.48s]  Another war factory. So this goes faster. This will be worth it. I'm rolling with tanks.
[5661.93s -> 5664.81s]  I actually probably can do some. I'm not going to do it, but I probably could take out some more
[5664.81s -> 5673.45s]  shit down here. Make a radar dome. I will after the second war factory. You're not even doing
[5673.45s -> 5682.28s]  it. You're just being annoying. You're not even doing anything. Bad strategist. Yeah, I know. I'm
[5682.28s -> 5688.74s]  pretty bad. So you can build your own rocket trucks. Can I? I don't think I can do that. Can
[5688.74s -> 5702.39s]  I do that? Oh no, that's right. This is a, this is Soviet, right? Yeah. Okay. Now that's better.
[5702.39s -> 5730.55s]  Let's make a bunch of light tanks. Yes, sir. Acknowledge. Affirmative. Kill it. Okay. Radar
[5730.55s -> 5742.78s]  dome. It's a thousand bucks. I need another ore truck. They're almost, they almost have all the
[5742.86s -> 5759.86s]  ore. And then they're dead because the only other ore is over here. Okay. I think it's worth,
[5759.86s -> 5765.43s]  I think I'm done. Affirmative. I have a lot of tanks. They don't have that. I need to have these
[5765.43s -> 5774.89s]  rocket things, but shit. I'm out of resources. Take out this snowplow.
[5776.57s -> 5793.59s]  Yes, sir. Kill this thing. Just kill it. Yes, sir. Get the Tesla coils. Get them. Hurry. I'm dead.
[5793.59s -> 5803.83s]  I was, I just like aggroed everything. That was to kill one Tesla coil. Um, it's over. I'm dead.
[5804.47s -> 5818.60s]  I don't have any money. I have zero dollars now. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. At least the Tesla coil is
[5818.60s -> 5830.70s]  gone. So this thing can actually ore. You guys are such a pain in the ass. This is what happens
[5830.70s -> 5840.86s]  when you fight mighty Russia. Yes, sir. Kill the harvester. I can't. If I do that, I aggro the whole
[5840.86s -> 5858.15s]  camp and they have a rocket guy right here. I'm so screwed. Not so mighty. I would just take the
[5858.15s -> 5864.39s]  bridge up, but I need to use this bridge. I'm going to park my guys here. Yes, sir. Or a truck.
[5864.39s -> 5871.29s]  Hurry up. I couldn't, I can destroy the bridge, but I don't want to go down here. I'd like to
[5871.29s -> 5875.77s]  keep going through here. All right. Make this thing's life a living hell. Cut them off.
[5877.02s -> 5884.94s]  Okay. You're harassing me. Stop it.
[5886.06s -> 5895.38s]  Kill the bridge. Not yet. I need this bridge. Wait, destroy the bridge and then put transport,
[5895.38s -> 5910.82s]  get transports. That's a great idea. Actually. How can you guys suck that much that you can't
[5910.82s -> 5916.98s]  shoot that one? Yes, sir. Yeah. Fuck it. Let's go destroy it. Cut off the resources. That's
[5916.98s -> 5938.98s]  completely. Can I? Yup. Do it. You ain't got shit now. Do it. Kill it. You're not going to let
[5938.98s -> 5951.42s]  this little shit kill you, are you? Okay. I have two ore trucks. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[5951.42s -> 5960.44s]  no. God damn it. Why didn't it get destroyed? And now here, this thing's going to stay. And now I
[5960.44s -> 5971.94s]  have no money. Ah, I'm going to eat up every resource. Why did this bridge not get destroyed?
[5977.75s -> 5984.44s]  Let me do my stupid thing. Do I need, I need to know. No, I don't.
[5990.57s -> 5998.62s]  Every tank versus every tank. Yes, sir. I got the jump on him. I got the first shot. I win.
[6015.51s -> 6034.90s]  I think I might have to restart. I have to restart. I'm not going to have enough money to do this.
[6036.97s -> 6041.45s]  I shouldn't have even made this. You know what happened? It's when I destroyed the service depot
[6041.45s -> 6073.11s]  that fucking tanks the whole game. I might still, I might be all right.
[6076.39s -> 6082.98s]  Actually don't even destroy the bridge. This thing is so fucking annoying. It does not have the toys.
[6088.12s -> 6106.55s]  What do they have? Just drown them. All right. Fucked up their resources.
[6110.68s -> 6122.84s]  Nice miss idiot. They have so much shit over here.
[6124.84s -> 6127.96s]  Now pull it back. Pull it back. Pull it back. Pull it back. Don't do it. Don't do it. I'm just
[6127.96s -> 6147.80s]  trying to just lead them out there resources. Take their refinery. They don't have it. That's
[6147.80s -> 6155.62s]  all right. They don't have trucks. Here comes a truck and it's dead. Control supply and you
[6155.62s -> 6167.02s]  won't have to worry. Control supply. They're not going to have any money left. Yes, sir.
[6167.02s -> 6178.42s]  You're really going to let that happen. You destroyed. I needed that. Oh my God.
[6179.38s -> 6201.14s]  Let's kill it. Where do you think it's going? You can't go over here. Oh, it has to go all
[6201.14s -> 6206.49s]  the way around. Now check this out. I'm going to make turrets. Don't aggro everybody.
[6215.08s -> 6222.46s]  Man, I'm so angry right now. The stupid ass V2 rocket blew the bridge up and it fucked up
[6222.46s -> 6246.81s]  my whole plan. How is this still alive? What? Yes, sir. Kill it. I have to go in the front
[6246.81s -> 6261.99s]  goddamn door. Shit. I got to take out everything. I need. I need. Okay. That thing. Every time I hear
[6261.99s -> 6273.43s]  that noise, I get fucking mad. What do I, I need money. They have more than me. They don't have
[6273.43s -> 6278.90s]  any money though. So just keep, just bleed them out completely. Can I make Sam sites? Not yet.
[6278.90s -> 6293.13s]  Let me make a radar. They're not going to attack. These guys sucks. Imagine getting stabbed. What?
[6293.13s -> 6301.34s]  The plane attacks cost them nothing. Okay. Good. Well, here comes another truck that thinks it's
[6301.34s -> 6320.33s]  going to actually do anything over here. It's not. Just wait. Okay. V2 rocket. Make one.
[6331.58s -> 6334.30s]  All right. Good luck ever having any money ever again.
[6335.74s -> 6340.58s]  I think I can actually reach the, yeah, let me, I'm going to get two of these.
[6341.46s -> 6343.70s]  I'm going to take out the Tesla coil in one shot.
[6347.16s -> 6355.16s]  Yes, sir. These things are just smoking. Okay. Yes, sir. I got two V2 rockets. I got a bunch of tanks.
[6356.68s -> 6362.74s]  Not quite ready. I will be very soon. Let's get some infantry. Yes, sir.
[6362.98s -> 6380.89s]  Knowledge. Okay. I can't. Okay. Now let's get like 10. I missed the spy. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[6380.89s -> 6384.49s]  All right. Here comes the truck. Good luck. You ain't going to get over here.
[6385.93s -> 6392.66s]  Got some infantry. Yes, sir. Affirmative. Okay. All right. I'm, I'm going for it. I'm going to
[6392.66s -> 6397.70s]  go for it. We're going to test the coil, kill Tesla coil, save it right here. Say this is something
[6397.70s -> 6413.24s]  else. Cause yeah, watch this shit. Yes, sir. Why would you shoot? You're not even shooting
[6413.24s -> 6420.04s]  at anything. I need those rockets loaded for when I take out the. Yes, sir. Very well.
[6428.90s -> 6434.41s]  These two V2 rockets have to shoot this and kill it. All right. I'm going one more heavy tank. I'm
[6434.41s -> 6451.05s]  going to game over. Here it goes. I'm ready for this. V2 rockets. Here we go. Yes, sir.
[6451.05s -> 6461.86s]  Oh, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you
[6461.86s -> 6473.08s]  doing? Why did you not? What? Sorry. We don't even need it. Don't even need it. Take it out.
[6493.77s -> 6497.96s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. Here it goes. Here it goes. Here it comes. Here it
[6497.96s -> 6538.10s]  comes. Here it comes. Kill this. Just stand off it's okay. Let's go. Go get it. You ain't got any
[6538.10s -> 6566.06s]  money motherfucker you can't do shit take out the war factor that's all I care
[6566.06s -> 6587.09s]  about who cares everything else fine go get it that's it game over I win all
[6587.09s -> 6600.10s]  right I didn't win yet this game is low-key cute yeah I mean sure I don't
[6600.10s -> 6610.12s]  let up don't let up power get rid of power make a Sam site I can't even make
[6610.12s -> 6651.94s]  it sit no I win I'm so glad I did the bleed him dry tactic an airfield I mean
[6651.94s -> 6665.40s]  that got this in the back actually no I don't that's not confirmed silos do it
[6665.40s -> 6680.11s]  no I don't even need a silo it took 75 minutes it did not take 75 minutes it
[6680.15s -> 6683.71s]  didn't take 75 minutes I've only been screaming for two hours it didn't take
[6683.71s -> 6690.24s]  it didn't take no it did not it did not take 75 minutes no it did not I refuse
[6690.24s -> 6706.71s]  to believe that it didn't take 75 minutes all right this thing's all that
[6706.71s -> 6722.28s]  he's in denial he's serious would you get the money to build this he's in
[6722.28s -> 6730.50s]  denial it did not take that long to build this it didn't take that long
[6730.62s -> 6743.25s]  get everybody in the right spot okay cool take it off see that's the play
[6743.25s -> 6766.82s]  as you sell it before it gets destroyed you'll never take me alive
[6766.82s -> 6782.07s]  the Soviet base is dumb and thick I don't know why I read that I don't know why do
[6782.07s -> 6793.50s]  I read anything what trucks oh you mean coming yeah let's go
[6794.06s -> 6833.74s]  faces huge what a giant-ass face go that's it some of you go this way haha
[6833.74s -> 6861.66s]  haha no I have to kill these go over there and deal with that you guys take
[6861.86s -> 6886.89s]  now it's the kill kill every unit yuck that was technically a unit Tanya's safe
[6886.89s -> 6903.53s]  you can go home did we hit 80 minutes I'm about to go look at the bond I'm
[6903.53s -> 6919.21s]  going to my bod right now and I'm gonna see that they're not even fighting back
[6919.77s -> 6932.43s]  I thought we got Tanya out wait would Titania not get out so very pretty but
[6932.43s -> 6959.39s]  also stubborn wait oh that's me that's the spy they get cut off so quickly I
[6959.83s -> 6981.50s]  want to see what happens one hour and 18 minutes no it hasn't but I I read that
[6981.50s -> 6987.03s]  was a hard mission but remember that was I had to like infiltrate the base and
[6987.03s -> 6992.30s]  escape with Tanya that's also included in that time that was two different
[6992.30s -> 7001.94s]  missions together I'm going down excellent work commander the information
[7002.06s -> 7009.58s]  recovered has proved invaluable would you not agree this is on normal normal
[7009.58s -> 7020.15s]  yes our analysis is almost come no no no sit sit I'm late I apologize
[7020.15s -> 7028.30s]  Albert Einstein is not working professor Einstein this is an honor
[7028.30s -> 7033.78s]  general Nikos Davros professor let me introduce the commander who rescued you
[7033.82s -> 7037.42s]  this is the only clothes that Albert Einstein ever wore apparently this
[7037.42s -> 7044.14s]  professor Albert Einstein yes very exciting he's always in this like I'm
[7044.14s -> 7051.04s]  in my brown vest and brown jacket these are reconnaissance photos there are no
[7051.04s -> 7056.40s]  photos of him see in pajamas professor perhaps you can help us identify the
[7056.40s -> 7064.33s]  specifics from what I've had a chance to read this is Stalin's main research
[7064.41s -> 7074.15s]  laboratory why would they be they are working on a new kind of defense he
[7074.15s -> 7080.19s]  doesn't look like this is it it's just messy bald gray head with mustache is
[7080.19s -> 7087.27s]  based on the theory of resonating molecules a sure yes professor but what
[7087.27s -> 7094.39s]  does the Iron Curtain do do well by the theorem it appears to make things
[7094.39s -> 7101.69s]  invulnerable any vehicle or structure covered with this effect this guy's
[7101.69s -> 7109.41s]  idea now will be impervious to harm yes Albert Einstein is dead yes I know
[7109.41s -> 7116.34s]  Tesla was experimenting with this kind of professor that is all we need to know
[7116.34s -> 7123.04s]  Soviet research on this device cannot be allowed to continue destroy it what else
[7123.04s -> 7129.44s]  do we know about this research he's not talking he just runs away put your
[7129.44s -> 7136.04s]  personal losses aside from a reveal yes of course besides R&D functions this
[7136.04s -> 7140.92s]  base also serves as a waypoint for Soviet submarine actions so it's
[7140.92s -> 7145.64s]  heavily populated as far as we can tell the only prototype they have of this
[7145.64s -> 7152.08s]  Iron Curtain is located here we do not know if it is operational yet commander
[7152.12s -> 7159.00s]  your task is simple get into that base infiltrate their laboratories and
[7159.00s -> 7167.88s]  destroy all information and prototypes of this Iron Curtain
[7167.88s -> 7176.74s]  this is one of the harder missions I looked up I saw it on the on the
[7176.74s -> 7184.84s]  Wikipedia it said this is the mission that's very hard let's make this good
[7184.88s -> 7204.11s]  okay go get it going all right before I do anything is there actually an attack
[7204.11s -> 7210.32s]  move because I can't seem to get it to work I don't think there is not what is
[7210.32s -> 7217.82s]  it no you can just move them where you want and then press G to put them on
[7217.82s -> 7225.50s]  area guard okay so it's G you just have to move him somewhere press G there is
[7225.50s -> 7229.66s]  no attack move in red alert yeah like that's all I needed now so just be G go
[7229.66s -> 7237.88s]  okay in fact you know just stop moving stop moving up get up there start
[7237.88s -> 7259.84s]  scouting G how big is this map pretty big take it out don't get in range of
[7259.84s -> 7271.99s]  them G don't sneak up there stay back how we doing refinery get it up radar
[7271.99s -> 7282.23s]  don't worry don't don't don't attack don't die you idiot sorry no no no no
[7282.23s -> 7291.37s]  it's just guarding G scout this way this is a GTA 5 sized map there are some maps
[7291.41s -> 7295.28s]  in this game that are huge they can have up to eight players play them that was a
[7295.28s -> 7311.10s]  spy plane I got a set to build up I don't have very much room all right power
[7311.10s -> 7315.12s]  plant I don't have any room I'm out of room I don't have any room I don't have any room to build
[7315.12s -> 7333.92s]  oh shit this is bad okay I need a barracks stay here and guard stay back
[7333.92s -> 7353.57s]  you guys up front G oh shit get over moving and shoot what are you doing why
[7353.57s -> 7384.03s]  did you do this oh fuck this is very bad I have no room spy oh fuck spy get in
[7384.03s -> 7395.29s]  there I need rocket soldiers to prevent that from happening why did I just make
[7395.29s -> 7411.39s]  two spies I just panicked it I don't know why I did that these guys over here
[7411.39s -> 7418.92s]  all right one of you guys will get this done I have to infiltrate what the iron
[7418.92s -> 7429.02s]  curtain good nothing can get over good okay stop that get regular inventory
[7429.02s -> 7464.46s]  what do I need to do all the Grenada's bad what do I need to infiltrate I just
[7464.54s -> 7482.94s]  keep coming in I don't even build anything I mean what was it I'm dead I
[7482.94s -> 7487.02s]  I needed to have turrets and pillboxes from the very beginning otherwise you
[7487.02s -> 7494.54s]  guaranteed to lose enemy tech center that's not up there all right I'm dead
[7494.54s -> 7505.16s]  it's over that's all so this fucking redo it again retry fishing all right you
[7505.16s -> 7509.56s]  got it you got to do you got a pillboxes and turrets eat immediately like to go
[7509.56s -> 7524.08s]  hurry that was nice and immediate thank you there are you still here standing
[7524.08s -> 7534.03s]  around what are you dumb
[7538.24s -> 7552.53s]  yes okay don't hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry move your MCV past the base
[7552.53s -> 7555.69s]  because I don't know if they have up here they might kill it before it gets
[7555.69s -> 7570.03s]  up there wait let me check that if we go up here and kill this shit let me see
[7570.03s -> 7574.88s]  maybe it actually would be better up here
[7577.52s -> 7602.96s]  yeah put it right there all right okay let's go before they send anybody over
[7602.96s -> 7638.20s]  this has to be quick kill all right deploy gee right here let's put you guys
[7638.20s -> 7646.38s]  here yes they fire from that far away barracks I'm gonna put the barracks right
[7646.38s -> 7654.76s]  I'm gonna start feeding out people I need infantry and then rocket soldiers
[7654.76s -> 7657.40s]  like five infantry let's go let's take these guys this way because they're
[7657.40s -> 7669.75s]  recently did you just see useless over here why am I not making buildings
[7670.23s -> 7680.58s]  I just made three pillboxes I know I know and it is after they or no no no no no
[7680.58s -> 7692.00s]  no no go go just do it now can these guys like volley anything over here two
[7692.00s -> 7700.79s]  pillboxes over there you can't just like shoot over it all right what about down
[7700.79s -> 7715.15s]  this way turret these guys are useless not but they could be okay I don't want
[7715.15s -> 7724.53s]  to spend I need two thousand dollars put the I'm gonna save right in the middle
[7724.53s -> 7734.55s]  like right here okay refinery I'm not a power fuck low power get spy into the
[7734.55s -> 7744.38s]  tech center yes it's probably down here refinery get it up
[7762.72s -> 7773.28s]  you dickhead I gotta spread these guys out because the grenades are gonna kill
[7773.28s -> 7799.90s]  them all okay it looks good give me the refinery war factory now look at his
[7799.90s -> 7804.26s]  multitasking it's actually pretty awful but you know I'll take the compliment
[7804.26s -> 7814.30s]  thank you at least I'm seeing where I'm going just take them both this way
[7815.30s -> 7835.03s]  I'm gonna use that thing for good more factories almost done how we doing wish
[7835.03s -> 7848.68s]  I put the war fact you're probably up here don't give a chance all right all
[7848.68s -> 7856.50s]  right all right all right easy don't go too far out don't go too far out stay
[7856.50s -> 7866.56s]  back the pillboxes somebody's gave a bunch of money KXE just mega cheered

[7893.20s -> 7918.17s]  do light tank what's that noise I just heard the Tesla coil boot up they have
[7918.17s -> 7937.58s]  Tesla coils over here do where the fuck is the or are you kidding me dude but
[7937.58s -> 7950.20s]  really though where's the or we got to get with the move forward all right a
[7950.20s -> 7953.20s]  couple more light tanks and we're gonna take this part over and I'm gonna make
[7953.20s -> 7962.99s]  an engineer or two I'm gonna steal some stuff so I can continue to build in fact
[7962.99s -> 7986.81s]  let's go hold on hold up hold up hold up hold up hold up tanks what do they got

[8280.01s -> 8290.44s]  affirmative affirmative gonna find the tech center affirmative four dollars currently that's

[8336.08s -> 8348.88s]  oh no i didn't even see that dog where's the tech center over here all right whatever okay
[8348.88s -> 8355.72s]  uh i mean i can at least i know i can do it i'm gonna get some gun boats and we're uh where's
[8355.72s -> 8380.62s]  my money yes sir all right i got three ore trucks give me a silo okay good uh

[13622.89s -> 13628.35s]  Oh shit!
[13628.35s -> 13638.54s]  Why do they have power?
[13638.54s -> 13642.62s]  How do they have power for this?
[13642.62s -> 13643.62s]  Kill it!
[13643.62s -> 13644.62s]  Kill it!
[13644.62s -> 13645.62s]  Kill it!
[13645.62s -> 13646.62s]  Kill it!
[13646.62s -> 13647.62s]  Kill the power!
[13647.62s -> 13653.78s]  Kill the power!
[13653.98s -> 13656.58s]  If you even two tesla coils can kill everybody here.
[13656.58s -> 13669.66s]  Take out the subpens.
[13669.66s -> 13670.66s]  I think I just did it.
[13670.66s -> 13676.38s]  Do they have more subpens?
[13676.38s -> 13685.37s]  Go with this.
[13685.37s -> 13686.37s]  Okay.
[13686.37s -> 13687.37s]  Done.
[13687.37s -> 13689.63s]  Where's the last subpen?
[13689.63s -> 13690.63s]  No more?
[13690.63s -> 13693.02s]  Up here.
[13693.02s -> 13724.92s]  What are you doing?
[13724.92s -> 13726.86s]  I saw...
[13726.86s -> 13727.86s]  I saw my construction yard.
[13727.86s -> 13728.86s]  There's no money left anyway.
[13728.86s -> 13729.86s]  I think I just did it.
[13729.86s -> 13734.10s]  I think I just did it.
[13734.10s -> 13735.10s]  I think I just did it.
[13735.10s -> 13741.84s]  I think I just did it.
[13741.84s -> 13742.84s]  I think I just did it.
[13742.84s -> 13743.84s]  I think I just did it.
[13743.84s -> 13744.84s]  I think I just did it.
[13744.84s -> 13745.84s]  I think I just did it.
[13745.84s -> 13751.51s]  I saw my construction yard.
[13751.51s -> 13754.11s]  There's no money left anyway.
[13754.11s -> 13761.26s]  I think I can kill them still.
[13761.26s -> 13762.58s]  The artillery has a bunch of range.
[13762.58s -> 13764.58s]  They just can't go underwater or I'm softlocked.
[13764.58s -> 13776.12s]  There's a little bit of money left in their base.
[13776.12s -> 13777.12s]  Okay.
[13777.12s -> 13778.12s]  Nobody fire yet.
[13778.12s -> 13780.16s]  Seriously, nobody fire.
[13780.16s -> 13782.14s]  Do not fire.
[13782.14s -> 13785.50s]  I need to get all the artillery up here and fire at the exact same time and kill them
[13785.50s -> 13786.50s]  on hit.
[13786.50s -> 13787.50s]  Destroy subpens.
[13787.50s -> 13788.50s]  You idiot.
[13788.50s -> 13789.50s]  Don't fire.
[13789.50s -> 13790.50s]  Don't.

[13791.82s -> 13793.34s]  Don't fire.
[13793.34s -> 13812.63s]  Don't fire.
[13812.63s -> 13814.43s]  Oh, you're going to ruin this whole thing.

[14044.58s -> 14046.58s]  I'll try to go this way
[14046.74s -> 14052.60s]  Sell units and make a new yard. I I don't have that. I can't make a new yard
[14053.46s -> 14057.33s]  No, this is over
[14057.33s -> 14062.55s]  It's over. I actually have to either restart or like put a cheat code in
[14064.59s -> 14073.72s]  There's like a pen down here that I can't see

[14284.24s -> 14291.79s]  artillery and gunboats
[14291.79s -> 14305.52s]  I don't need that much artillery. I do need gunboats though. We're gonna do the same thing we did
[14305.52s -> 14307.52s]  We're gonna go in and we're gonna attack
[14307.72s -> 14315.31s]  We have to do this quickly though. Like for instance, I remember getting angry at this part right here
[14315.31s -> 14319.47s]  I got really fucking mad at this part because now I just remember I said this
[14319.47s -> 14323.23s]  Oh, I just moved him and all of a sudden now I remember I said that you remember that right?

[14420.80s -> 14424.80s]  It might be time to do everything except construction yard. I actually agree with you know
[14425.88s -> 14428.21s]  But not yet
[14428.21s -> 14432.44s]  Save it right before that happens. Oh

[15708.71s -> 15714.38s]  More destroyed how many do I need?
[15714.70s -> 15715.90s]  like ten
[15715.90s -> 15719.74s]  They probably have like one two, three, four five this one. Okay, I'm gonna guess
[15720.40s -> 15723.04s]  I'm gonna get six just stuffed up here in his closet
[15723.68s -> 15726.69s]  one two, three, four five six
[15727.25s -> 15742.26s]  So that means I have to go in with like ten
[15744.12s -> 15746.12s]  It takes 80 minutes per level
[15746.44s -> 15749.20s]  Yeah
[15749.20s -> 15755.92s]  This is a hard game. It's tricky and yeah, okay. Well, I'll level with you here. I will be fair. I
[15757.32s -> 15763.04s]  Don't RTS is not like the thing that I'm known for I'm made only I'm basically mostly known for
[15763.76s -> 15768.08s]  Beating the last boss in securo on stream in under 60 tries. That's what I'm known for
[15768.24s -> 15771.24s]  This is not what I'm known for. So I obviously not gonna be that great
[15787.24s -> 15794.62s]  If there's no way I lose I can't lose I actually cannot lose as long as I have
[15797.20s -> 15799.20s]  Look at how big this Navy is
[15801.91s -> 15803.27s]  I'll be ready
[15803.27s -> 15813.06s]  Wait, this guy actually beats the carol. Yep. I really did
[15813.70s -> 15817.92s]  All right. Is there anything else I should do?
[15824.21s -> 15826.21s]  How about a second naval you had to make this faster?
[15827.52s -> 15850.20s]  Yeah, this is plenty of money over here. Come on. Really? Is this too far away?
[15854.71s -> 15862.44s]  What what?
[15868.53s -> 15872.71s]  Power
[15872.71s -> 15874.71s]  Just capture the other refinery
[15878.95s -> 15881.51s]  Why did I do that? I why did I do that? I could have put it over
[15882.39s -> 15883.99s]  You know i'm known for
[15883.99s -> 15887.51s]  I used to do these things called tf2 live gameplay commentaries
[15889.19s -> 15893.03s]  And I used to play as certain characters like the spy and I would go for weapons
[15899.97s -> 15904.34s]  This has to be enough you know what I mean, seriously, this is
[15904.90s -> 15907.94s]  There's so many boats
[15907.94s -> 15909.94s]  This if this is not enough
[15909.94s -> 15911.94s]  Then I deserve to lose
[15912.34s -> 15922.31s]  Affirmative. Yes, sir. Acknowledge. Yes, sir. Let's go. Yes, sir. Affirmative
[15926.36s -> 15930.00s]  Acknowledged you have the tactical advantage
[15931.57s -> 15932.77s]  Not really
[15932.77s -> 15934.77s]  He has submarines. I don't know where they are
[15935.17s -> 15937.41s]  I mean they're here, but they could be anywhere
[15938.11s -> 15973.48s]  affirmative
[15973.48s -> 15983.57s]  guy
[15983.65s -> 15985.65s]  Fucking god, how many do you have acknowledged?
[15990.26s -> 15996.72s]  I know I have to destroy the sub pens. What do you think?
[16004.64s -> 16008.60s]  Acknowledge
[16009.48s -> 16014.53s]  All right, let's let's celebrate
[16046.84s -> 16052.36s]  Where where are the planes coming from ever cease fire cease fire cease fire cease fire
[16052.92s -> 16065.74s]  Cease fire. Where are the planes coming from? Yes, sir. Oh my god. You have so many submarines
[16066.68s -> 16068.68s]  Just get in
[16069.97s -> 16071.97s]  Where are the planes?
[16076.02s -> 16079.14s]  Is there a tiny island that he put a airstrip on
[16091.17s -> 16094.21s]  Where is that? You know what? Go look over here. I need to know
[16097.33s -> 16107.27s]  There's a tesla coil over here this guy these things are like 2,800 is like $3,000. Why is it over here?
[16117.83s -> 16120.13s]  Yes, sir, affirmative
[16120.69s -> 16123.56s]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Acknowledged
[16124.76s -> 16127.72s]  Okay, there is no other area on this map
[16129.66s -> 16133.30s]  Where's the other airfield?
[16133.30s -> 16135.54s]  Affirmative that doesn't make any sense
[16151.30s -> 16173.96s]  Got it two hours
[16174.12s -> 16190.44s]  Whatever the game just crashed. I got the actual spinning death and the window came up that said
[16191.16s -> 16193.56s]  Uh, the program stopped responding but now it came back
[16195.72s -> 16200.66s]  Thank god
[16200.66s -> 16228.10s]  I uh left
[16231.78s -> 16233.78s]  I
[16237.75s -> 16242.30s]  Incredible we made it disappear and reappear
[16243.82s -> 16245.82s]  But with very little control
[16246.78s -> 16253.82s]  We lost some men, but do you have the control problem solved? That is the heart of the chronosphere project
[16255.18s -> 16257.66s]  Charging this is where you come in
[16258.46s -> 16260.30s]  I wanted you to see this
[16260.38s -> 16262.86s]  She understands the importance of your next mission
[16267.22s -> 16269.78s]  He still the clonosphere is being tested here
[16270.50s -> 16272.58s]  At our research center outside like
[16273.56s -> 16279.08s]  The soviets recently learned of its location and have begun bombing it regularly
[16279.88s -> 16282.04s]  You must protect this research site
[16283.30s -> 16288.98s]  And the scientists working inside get to the base immediately and fortify it
[16289.62s -> 16291.62s]  we would evacuate the base but
[16292.50s -> 16294.74s]  Months of preparation would be wasted
[16295.54s -> 16301.78s]  The buildings and their contents must remain operational until the experiment is complete
[16302.26s -> 16306.87s]  So I have to defend against probably waves
[16307.35s -> 16314.14s]  But I say it was like
[16315.02s -> 16317.02s]  Of a a guns
[16322.98s -> 16328.55s]  I don't even have a
[16328.55s -> 16330.55s]  All right. This is the base. What is that?
[16330.71s -> 16335.35s]  This is the chronosphere. Yes, sir. Okay. All right, go go go go. What am I doing? Go go. I didn't go
[16335.67s -> 16337.67s]  What do I need to go go go?
[16340.82s -> 16400.47s]  What's where are they attacking get down there I could I could just build it over here though
[16412.50s -> 16414.50s]  Get in reporting
[16414.58s -> 16417.40s]  That's the definition of a bad idea
[16418.20s -> 16421.48s]  It's all right. I made it that was just to get the escort over here. That's it
[16423.88s -> 16427.96s]  All right, get in here
[16427.96s -> 16430.12s]  Sell the tech center if you need cash, you just need the chronosphere
[16432.14s -> 16435.10s]  Not a bad idea. All right, let's get it right is good
[16441.98s -> 16444.22s]  All right, let's do it
[16444.78s -> 16448.55s]  What do we got over here? I have lots of money tons of money
[16454.92s -> 16459.88s]  Shoot it I want you to power power power power power power power power power power
[16466.95s -> 16470.23s]  All right, anybody else I could maybe take this over
[16471.56s -> 16473.64s]  Vehicles, oh don't you dare?
[16474.68s -> 16476.30s]  fuck
[16476.30s -> 16478.79s]  Okay, any doubts
[16478.87s -> 16481.35s]  I just wrong power plant. I picked the wrong one. Hey agon
[16486.17s -> 16488.17s]  He's gonna do this in more than 40 minutes
[16491.77s -> 16493.13s]  Don't worry
[16493.13s -> 16496.20s]  There's plenty of time
[16500.71s -> 16505.53s]  Good. All right. Everything's online. I'm gonna fortify the fuck out of this place
[16521.08s -> 16524.44s]  All right, now I just need to survive for 40 minutes
[16525.40s -> 16527.40s]  Oh god

[16712.76s -> 16714.76s]  I didn't do this fast enough
[16721.77s -> 16728.65s]  I need fucking units. I need units. I didn't do this. Correct. I might have to stop this over. I didn't realize oh
[16728.81s -> 16735.37s]  I did not realize I had to do that. I didn't realize what they were asking me now. I do I know what I realize it now

[16850.49s -> 16860.09s]  I might just sell the tech center. That was actually pretty good advice sell tech center if you need, uh stuff
[16863.54s -> 16868.08s]  Um, okay here comes another bunch of people
[16869.04s -> 16871.79s]  Yes, sir

[16892.78s -> 16906.27s]  close
[16906.27s -> 16921.10s]  I need the money. They're in the tech center. They're in the tech center
[16921.18s -> 16924.62s]  They're in the tech center. Somebody told me to sell the tech center and they were so convincing
[16929.02s -> 16933.26s]  So he said if you run out of money sell the tech center and I go to sell the chronosphere
[16934.22s -> 16938.64s]  And I even said it twice back to myself over the last 15 minutes
[16943.77s -> 16950.09s]  And I have to start over from the very beginning, all right, let me do this differently

[17715.64s -> 17717.88s]  That means go when I click that means you go
[17718.60s -> 17726.28s]  Don't stand there
[17726.28s -> 17731.98s]  sell tech center
[17731.98s -> 17733.98s]  Don't let it just stay there kill it
[17733.98s -> 17735.98s]  That means attack it

[17893.76s -> 17898.50s]  He's so stressed. Yeah, it's a very stressful game. It's super stressful
[17903.52s -> 17908.22s]  Sounds good sell the spinning. I don't I don't know what those are. I'm not going to touch those
[17919.77s -> 17928.73s]  Sell them i'm not going to sell them may have a tank good actually though those versions very good
[17930.56s -> 17932.56s]  25 more minutes and we're done
[17932.56s -> 17941.18s]  Let's get another medium tank
[17945.20s -> 17950.08s]  I would build more turrets, but I guess maybe i'll put another one over here
[17952.43s -> 17955.63s]  Yes, sir. Acknowledge sell your construction yard. Why would I do that?
[17957.08s -> 17964.25s]  That sounds like a bad idea
[17964.65s -> 17968.20s]  I'll do one more up here in this spot
[17979.10s -> 17983.58s]  All right, here it comes here's a block them off block them up. They're gonna come don't even let them get to shore
[17983.98s -> 17989.85s]  Don't let them get to shore. Where are they? Where are they?
[17994.75s -> 17996.75s]  Yes, sir
[18005.72s -> 18007.16s]  Fuck
[18007.16s -> 18015.55s]  They get over the rocks are even possible to get over there
[18016.59s -> 18035.36s]  You guys so useless just take i'm gonna take them. I think they take a long way every time
[18041.85s -> 18043.85s]  A giant circle
[18057.00s -> 18068.32s]  Just get up there and fight
[18073.55s -> 18077.00s]  So i'm gonna start doing light tanks
[18084.57s -> 18086.57s]  No only medium tanks
[18087.55s -> 18089.55s]  Let's get some more uh infantry as well
[18091.77s -> 18093.77s]  Oh, I don't have money I need more money than this
[18096.73s -> 18118.25s]  Where's he going? All right, that's fine. Don't let them stand there
[18132.41s -> 18139.93s]  Two minutes takes two minutes takes focus focus one at a time
[18147.29s -> 18149.29s]  Oh shit, I can't build any
[18151.34s -> 18153.34s]  Pull back fall back to the tech center
[18162.52s -> 18164.96s]  What was that?
[18165.76s -> 18170.30s]  I've still got plenty of money
[18172.62s -> 18181.96s]  How am I doing I got power still
[18183.56s -> 18191.90s]  You can come back to the front he's gonna be playing this the whole street
[18192.70s -> 18195.00s]  I mean i've been playing for five hours already
[18199.24s -> 18201.24s]  This is what we're doing
[18204.52s -> 18206.52s]  All right, I knew I should have waited here
[18208.67s -> 18213.45s]  Yes, sir, yeah idiot get out of here. Yes, sir. Don't let him get away with that
[18215.29s -> 18219.68s]  He's gonna go all the way around be ready
[18237.31s -> 18239.71s]  Oh god the v2 rockets are over here
[18242.51s -> 18247.00s]  13 minutes reporting I need to stop making stuff
[18265.84s -> 18271.79s]  Rocket soldiers build turrets
[18273.37s -> 18278.17s]  Yeah, I mean, yes, sir, but they'll they'll get in I only got 10 minutes i'm good
[18291.93s -> 18295.37s]  Good probably gonna get really hairy here in a second
[18298.81s -> 18302.86s]  I'm just gonna block the port
[18302.86s -> 18303.98s]  Where are you going?
[18303.98s -> 18308.92s]  Okay
[18308.92s -> 18311.96s]  Get out of here with this shit where they come. All right, get ready
[18317.10s -> 18319.10s]  Oh you're going for my shit, huh?
[18321.10s -> 18336.40s]  All right now i'm gonna do only turrets
[18337.32s -> 18339.32s]  I'm gonna pull everybody back
[18341.10s -> 18343.44s]  I want at least three turrets on each side. I heard something
[18359.44s -> 18367.63s]  Don't let him destroy that I need that nine minutes remain
[18375.95s -> 18381.01s]  Yeah, you ain't going in this way that's fine coming this way one mammoth tank
[18385.07s -> 18399.02s]  Oh so much to pay attention to
[18399.26s -> 18413.69s]  Who's left what else what else what else what else what else we good?
[18427.98s -> 18430.46s]  Don't let him in the face they're going for the v2 rockets
[18431.42s -> 18435.77s]  Um, um, I don't know over here
[18438.14s -> 18440.14s]  Don't do it sounds
[18455.79s -> 18457.79s]  Five minutes, that's it
[18460.99s -> 18462.86s]  Get over there
[18462.86s -> 18466.38s]  Uh, okay another turret
[18468.60s -> 18470.60s]  Don't go too far out here
[18477.71s -> 18479.23s]  What needs help?
[18479.23s -> 18482.16s]  this side does
[18494.96s -> 18523.90s]  No on the northern front money. All right, don't bring every single person. Yes, sir pull it back. Yes, sir
[18525.31s -> 18529.34s]  That hurt pull it back back back back back back. I need some right side support
[18537.12s -> 18541.15s]  All right three minutes I haven't saved it in a long time
[18551.71s -> 18553.63s]  This should be in the bag
[18553.63s -> 18556.17s]  All right, that
[18556.17s -> 18558.17s]  Yes, sir. This is wild
[18561.13s -> 18563.13s]  40 minutes defense now
[18569.08s -> 18571.39s]  Two minutes remain
[18587.82s -> 18589.82s]  I think they it's gonna take too long for them to get over
[18590.86s -> 18594.84s]  This should be done
[18594.84s -> 18598.04s]  I really just hope I don't have to kill them at the end because that would suck
[18598.68s -> 18610.28s]  Kill his ore truck
[18610.28s -> 18615.40s]  I have to assume the ore is meaningless because they just it's like waves. So I don't know. I don't think I don't think he even has to
[18616.44s -> 18618.44s]  Actually spend money
[18618.68s -> 18623.04s]  Plus we got 30 seconds still
[18629.50s -> 18631.50s]  This is counting down very fast
[18631.66s -> 18635.76s]  Is it kind of not that fast?
[18637.08s -> 18639.48s]  So that wasn't 40 minutes then that was like 10 minutes
[18655.14s -> 18657.56s]  46 minutes now, I guess it was 46 minutes
[18666.79s -> 18678.91s]  Incredible. All right. I feel like i've gone bottom most of the time
[18679.87s -> 18695.52s]  Let's go up commander. Is he controlling that? I believe if he may well be at the turning point of this war
[18696.00s -> 18700.53s]  The stalin's iron curtain offline and the success of the chronosphere
[18701.31s -> 18704.30s]  Victory is finally within our grasp
[18705.63s -> 18709.77s]  However, there is still much to be done
[18711.29s -> 18714.17s]  One of our spies has confirmed our worst fears
[18714.89s -> 18721.07s]  So russians have developed a weapon greater than anything previously known an atomic bomb
[18722.33s -> 18726.49s]  Stalin plans to unleash these bombs on several european cities
[18727.29s -> 18730.97s]  If he succeeds all they have worked for as a race as allies
[18731.53s -> 18734.38s]  To be for naught
[18734.38s -> 18735.42s]  this
[18735.42s -> 18737.42s]  Is major vladimir korsygin?
[18737.66s -> 18740.08s]  One of stalin's key atomic strategists
[18741.40s -> 18746.84s]  Intelligence indicates that he has vital information on stalin's plans for this new weapon
[18748.06s -> 18752.16s]  Kosygin is appalled by stalin's methods and is ready to defect
[18753.40s -> 18754.62s]  apparently
[18754.62s -> 18757.34s]  Stalin plans to use his own troops
[18757.98s -> 18763.50s]  As sacrificial lambs to draw our forces into a trap once v takes the bait
[18764.14s -> 18770.96s]  He drops the bomb you will find Kosygin here in the riha compound
[18771.66s -> 18776.44s]  Direct the spy past that compound's defenses to the command center
[18777.79s -> 18782.60s]  Once you reach Kosygin get your apcs in and Kosygin out
[18783.16s -> 18804.09s]  Okay, build your base get a spy into the command center. Let's do it. Let's see if we can get someone clean and quick
[18817.28s -> 18820.73s]  Clean and quick
[18820.97s -> 18824.65s]  Scouts you go that way
[18825.61s -> 18826.97s]  You go that way
[18826.97s -> 18833.31s]  Good luck
[18834.51s -> 18841.04s]  Okay
[18841.36s -> 18843.36s]  There's very ore on this whole island
[18845.82s -> 18848.76s]  Uh
[18852.22s -> 18854.22s]  Well, why am I building a refinery then?
[18864.27s -> 18867.79s]  No, no, no, no, no, but I should have built right over here though
[18869.31s -> 18871.31s]  All right, i'm restarting
[18871.63s -> 18875.23s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I this is gonna be clean and quick. This is not clean and quick
[18886.60s -> 18891.56s]  You have the game speed termed up this is what yeah, this is the default though, I think isn't it?
[18893.08s -> 18895.08s]  I don't think I changed anything
[18896.76s -> 18900.16s]  There we go
[18902.48s -> 18906.48s]  Turn it up more. No, you can't play this game at like times 10 speed. It's ridiculous
[18910.30s -> 18912.30s]  Yeah, there's plenty of uh fluid over here
[18914.49s -> 18916.54s]  Plenty of food
[18916.54s -> 18918.54s]  I think the default's actually even faster
[18920.46s -> 18925.82s]  I think it actually is but it becomes unmanageable when you go so high for instance. Just look
[18928.72s -> 18930.72s]  One two, like just watch this
[18935.07s -> 18946.57s]  Um, I my brain can't handle this turn it down turn it down. It's actually hurting me
[18949.88s -> 18951.96s]  Okay. Good. Uh now i'm gonna do barracks
[18953.02s -> 18960.00s]  Let's get a spy
[18962.48s -> 18964.48s]  Spy is we need a
[18968.83s -> 18973.31s]  Not advanced power first
[18975.84s -> 18977.84s]  You're gonna do red alert two some other day
[18978.64s -> 18980.88s]  Maybe I mean, I love these games
[18982.12s -> 18985.16s]  I didn't play that much red alert two, but I do remember it was fun
[18985.24s -> 18992.83s]  Um
[18992.83s -> 18996.11s]  You can uh, you deploy your troops in red alert two, right?
[18996.19s -> 18998.99s]  You can bunker them down in that big mechanic of the game
[19000.11s -> 19001.87s]  Actually, it's pretty huge
[19001.87s -> 19010.52s]  You have a spy into the command center. I'm gonna try
[19015.18s -> 19017.66s]  You need a naval yard go ahead and build it
[19024.72s -> 19028.56s]  They promote that's right. They do promote that's so fun. Yeah, i'll play that
[19032.00s -> 19035.92s]  Uh, i'm thinking down here so they're the transports aren't any danger
[19038.35s -> 19041.29s]  Let's get them in one see what we can do
[19048.72s -> 19057.36s]  War factory jan rittles is the best one. Yes, sir. They're all good
[19060.97s -> 19063.45s]  There's not very many commanding conquers that aren't fun
[19065.26s -> 19067.26s]  Tiberian sun is fun
[19067.74s -> 19071.50s]  All right, i'm just gonna go on a little espionage mission here
[19080.11s -> 19081.77s]  Just keep going up
[19081.77s -> 19086.33s]  It doesn't seem like i'm very much danger, but i'm gonna tech for a little bit to make sure I don't get killed
[19088.49s -> 19091.31s]  Have an assault team going with the spy
[19092.35s -> 19095.79s]  The reason why I don't want to do that is because they might just all instantly die
[19101.64s -> 19105.08s]  I am going to do three ore trucks together at the same time
[19106.60s -> 19108.60s]  Let's do a
[19109.34s -> 19113.88s]  Uh, get a surface depot too. I want to tech tech tech tech tech tech
[19113.88s -> 19117.16s]  Acknowledge affirmative acknowledge. All right, let's dump them
[19118.44s -> 19121.69s]  Acknowledge yes on my way
[19122.09s -> 19124.97s]  For king and country i'm gonna get eaten by a dog instantly indeed
[19127.10s -> 19144.43s]  For king and country for king and country is a huge map too on my way. All right, let's do

[19149.66s -> 19152.30s]  Dog dog dog because dog dog dog right next to me
[19153.10s -> 19155.10s]  Fuck. Okay. How am I gonna wrap around?
[19159.68s -> 19167.93s]  Yes, sir, what's their route? I might have to do some killing here
[19168.01s -> 19170.01s]  I might actually have to bring this all team up
[19170.49s -> 19181.15s]  Because i'm not sure this wraps around on my way king and country indeed
[19182.43s -> 19184.43s]  All right, we have to yeah, we're gonna get this all team up here
[19185.32s -> 19188.76s]  Yes, sir, king and country because we're gonna go right at the front door and they ain't gonna move

[19236.75s -> 19238.75s]  Why did you not shoot the dog?
[19239.63s -> 19243.55s]  Click attack dog and it is walking over like shoot it
[19243.63s -> 19251.34s]  Hit

[19484.03s -> 19486.03s]  Hold on. I can do transports, right?
[19487.72s -> 19489.80s]  APC is a transport vehicle. We're gonna do

[19999.28s -> 20010.22s]  King and country indeed king and country. All right, it's tech center right here for king and country
[20018.28s -> 20020.28s]  But that's not that's the command center

[20066.24s -> 20073.92s]  Yes, of course, yes, yes, of course move out move out
[20077.58s -> 20079.58s]  You brought him over here

[20148.88s -> 20151.04s]  That does that doesn't work
[20151.04s -> 20153.04s]  The whole base is dogs. How do you get in there?
[20154.36s -> 20157.40s]  Do I have to just go just kill everything and then sneak a spy in?
[20160.40s -> 20162.80s]  The term sneak doesn't make any sense at that point
[20165.47s -> 20170.19s]  Just running and just cause a massacre and then sneak in a spy when there's three buildings left
[20177.28s -> 20180.09s]  Just zerg the dogs
[20180.09s -> 20183.21s]  Send a hundred spies. I might even just fucking do that
[20188.35s -> 20206.88s]  No, they can't even attack. I can't believe I didn't even save it either. Oh, it's so annoying
[20208.00s -> 20216.54s]  You cannot win against so weak might no you can't win against

[20251.36s -> 20253.36s]  Mozart. I mean, yeah, I don't
[20253.76s -> 20256.16s]  I'm not like I don't have bethoven cds in my car

[20276.22s -> 20278.22s]  I am not on the same level
[20278.22s -> 20284.78s]  No, i'm not at that when kim was watching like an hour ago. I was on the previous mission. This is a different mission
[20291.82s -> 20295.58s]  By the way, just in case anyone's curious i'm doing six ore trucks
[20297.07s -> 20299.07s]  And then i'm gonna save the damn game
[20299.39s -> 20318.33s]  Because nobody's attacking nobody attacks
[20319.37s -> 20324.25s]  So I may as well just spam ore trucks and just have 20 million bajillion dollars
[20325.21s -> 20344.19s]  Yes, sir, that's it last one. Yes, sir, they're gonna start running into each other
[20353.77s -> 20358.04s]  Okay, get the radar dome I mean I want to build another construction site
[20358.68s -> 20364.51s]  I almost just built another one. That would have been really stupid
[20366.91s -> 20372.70s]  And guess what i'm doing a third war factory and then we're i'm going to send
[20373.82s -> 20375.82s]  50 tanks up here
[20378.11s -> 20380.27s]  I'm going to be a cycle about this
[20380.27s -> 20390.04s]  Yes
[20390.04s -> 20404.22s]  Dump dump dump dump dump dump. You wouldn't do 50 ore trucks, would you?
[20405.31s -> 20406.67s]  I probably would
[20406.67s -> 20408.67s]  But i'd like to beat this level
[20410.72s -> 20412.40s]  I'd like to complete this
[20412.40s -> 20414.19s]  It'd be good
[20414.19s -> 20419.18s]  Remember this level is unbeatable without the fursuit
[20419.90s -> 20421.90s]  Oh shit, where do I get that?
[20428.91s -> 20430.43s]  All right, that's enough
[20430.43s -> 20435.46s]  Look at these medium tanks. They're just so they're just so spammable
[20437.34s -> 20449.88s]  One more silo
[20449.88s -> 20454.76s]  All right, I don't want to just only I gotta do this again, too. This is uh

[21485.12s -> 21486.60s]  scorched earth
[21486.60s -> 21489.55s]  You can't say sneak a guy in and then
[21498.72s -> 21503.48s]  Destroy all Soviet units and structures awaiting orders. I'm gonna give this one attempt

[21574.90s -> 21576.90s]  I need to make sure I'm not going into danger
[21588.16s -> 21591.16s]  Till that dog kill that dog

[23203.52s -> 23206.00s]  Can I'm this is i'm testing to see I don't think I can pass
[23207.68s -> 23209.68s]  I don't even have any units anyways
[23213.17s -> 23215.17s]  What through the trees?
[23216.79s -> 23218.79s]  Can you like burn the trees down or something?
[23223.03s -> 23225.03s]  No, this was a shithead run anyways
[23228.71s -> 23231.51s]  No, you can't can you from here maybe it's just a little moat
[23233.51s -> 23237.86s]  Maybe I can cross it
[23249.99s -> 23258.00s]  Damn well, that was fun. That was a fun game
[23258.72s -> 23260.63s]  it's uh
[23260.63s -> 23263.06s]  red alert
[23263.06s -> 23265.06s]  It is as fun as I remember
[23266.00s -> 23268.32s]  Last time I played it. I was probably 16
[23269.04s -> 23279.32s]  It's very very good
[23279.32s -> 23280.68s]  last year
[23280.68s -> 23285.86s]  So am I going to beat it tomorrow?
[23286.61s -> 23288.61s]  Uh, I don't know
[23288.87s -> 23290.87s]  I don't know about that
[23290.95s -> 23292.95s]  There's too much to do tomorrow. I think
[23293.43s -> 23304.13s]  Play red alert 2 before the game awards. I cannot do that
[23305.73s -> 23310.55s]  Before the game awards i'm going to be in the minecraft server
[23311.83s -> 23314.77s]  So because that is really going hard
[23317.56s -> 23319.64s]  And we need to get it set up for the weekend
[23323.22s -> 23324.76s]  All right, that's it
[23324.76s -> 23326.76s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow for the game awards
[23326.92s -> 23328.36s]  You can beat this
[23328.36s -> 23335.14s]  We'll we'll see how much time is left. How long are the game awards? What are they a few hours two three four hours?
[23340.37s -> 23345.60s]  Something like that probably a couple hours two three hours
[23347.00s -> 23349.19s]  Well, it's probably going to take
[23349.19s -> 23353.99s]  It'll take probably at least 30 to 40 minutes to really slowly go over everything that's going to happen with the minecraft server
[23354.95s -> 23358.84s]  So after that maybe i'll just you know, try to beat it
[23358.92s -> 23362.44s]  I don't know. I can't make any guarantees that i'm gonna play it again today tomorrow
[23363.32s -> 23366.29s]  This mission has a special failure cutscene
[23367.17s -> 23375.99s]  Does it?
[23376.07s -> 23379.01s]  Yes, sir. Okay
[23379.81s -> 23402.32s]  The guy's on red alert what the hell is going on
[23428.84s -> 23433.16s]  Damn
[23433.16s -> 23435.16s]  Well, that was a
[23436.90s -> 23438.10s]  that was
[23438.10s -> 23441.30s]  Red alert two is the best red alert. They're all good. They're all of them are good
[23443.41s -> 23457.75s]  All right. One last thing before we go
[23460.07s -> 23466.10s]  Y'all start here wait what i'm behind i'm behind i'm behind i'm behind
[23483.08s -> 23487.88s]  Make fake ones. I wanted to play skirmish just because it's so much fun. All right, just start going check killing
[23488.60s -> 23494.80s]  I'm just make barracks just don't even make or who cares
[23549.60s -> 23569.25s]  Get out of here with that shit
[23569.57s -> 23575.11s]  This is a mess unit lost unit unit unit lost unit lost unit lost unit lost
[23593.73s -> 23595.73s]  That teaming up on me wait what
[23597.83s -> 23608.26s]  What why were they teaming up on me?
[23621.01s -> 23623.25s]  No bases
[23623.25s -> 23626.56s]  50 units each eight players
[23630.26s -> 23653.17s]  Good luck focus one tank at a time
[23672.13s -> 23674.13s]  Oh shit here comes teal
[23678.98s -> 23683.27s]  Don't spread out so thin
[23683.27s -> 23686.31s]  Don't go up there. Don't go up there. Let's kill each other. Let's kill each other. Not you
[23686.31s -> 23697.46s]  Yes, sir ready and waiting is there a reason why they're not fighting each other
[23703.46s -> 23718.41s]  Why is he yes sir affirmative affirmative they know you're human affirmative
[23719.83s -> 23739.78s]  Well, this is unfair
[23739.78s -> 23742.85s]  Uh, there's orange
[23742.85s -> 23747.16s]  Hey, it's it's a war germany. There is no fair
[23748.64s -> 23759.91s]  Well, i've refused to participate
[23759.91s -> 23763.60s]  All right, your apm is too low
[23764.16s -> 23766.48s]  It doesn't matter as long as you have fun. It doesn't matter
[23767.20s -> 23769.51s]  All right, i'll see you guys tomorrow
[23769.51s -> 23771.67s]  For the game awards and then we'll talk about minecraft
[23772.55s -> 23777.11s]  A lot to talk about it should be a ton of fun. I am so excited for this stream. You have no idea
[23779.28s -> 23780.96s]  That was red alert
[23780.96s -> 23782.96s]  I may or may not play this tomorrow
[23783.52s -> 23786.56s]  After we go over minecraft. I don't know it depends on what's going on
[23786.56s -> 23790.00s]  I might have to believe and get some stuff situated with the server
[23790.08s -> 23791.92s]  It's going to be the next few days are going to be a little messy
[23791.92s -> 23795.12s]  So we'll see but I will see you tomorrow for the game awards at least
[23795.84s -> 23798.31s]  Have a great night
[23798.31s -> 23799.83s]  We'll do the bits
[23799.83s -> 23806.72s]  And the subs, of course as always see you tomorrow for the game awards get your bingo cards ready
[23806.72s -> 23808.72s]  I mean i'm not making one but just get them ready
[23821.16s -> 23824.12s]  Let's go back. I can't believe i've played that for almost seven hours
[23824.84s -> 23832.36s]  I did get addicted. It's it's it's hard but it's addicting and it's fun. It's good
[23833.00s -> 23838.60s]  Hey peaceful hailey
[23838.60s -> 23844.74s]  Thanks for the 250 say hey germa tomorrow's my birthday. I'm turning 22. Have a birthday
[23845.30s -> 23852.60s]  Kind of weird to say I know it's not old but I know that i'm getting to that age where I don't think I should be
[23852.76s -> 23855.40s]  Fucking around and doing nothing with myself
[23856.20s -> 23858.92s]  You in this community has made me want to do better things for myself
[23859.56s -> 23861.56s]  Anyways, I hope you had a good stream. Good night
[23862.28s -> 23864.64s]  Well, first of all, happy birthday
[23864.64s -> 23868.18s]  And second of all you got a lot of time. Don't worry
[23871.89s -> 23874.05s]  22 is really not that old. It's not
[23876.10s -> 23878.10s]  If you're in your early 20s
[23878.18s -> 23879.30s]  You got
[23879.30s -> 23883.78s]  You got plenty of time. I I didn't know what the hell I was gonna do till I was like 27
[23884.40s -> 23886.96s]  26
[23886.96s -> 23888.96s]  And even then I still didn't know what the hell I was doing
[23890.92s -> 23894.60s]  And even now i'm still a kid now. I'm i'm not even grown up yet
[23898.82s -> 23901.54s]  I got and also I got news for everybody yet. Nobody knows what the fuck they're doing
[23903.75s -> 23907.67s]  It's just a series of people just kind of doing the best they can
[23912.26s -> 23914.82s]  Even when you get to an age you're like, all right, I think I figured it out
[23918.39s -> 23920.39s]  It's a never-ending process
[23922.71s -> 23924.15s]  Don't worry about that
[23924.15s -> 23929.94s]  Happy birthday. Peaceful. Haley. Thanks for the 250 at my starfish. Thanks to the five community subs
[23931.92s -> 23936.00s]  I was very very focused today because I did this was just I play the game stream
[23936.32s -> 23943.19s]  I was remembering and it's being very very nostalgic and I was getting uh, I was being very nostalgic at how angry I would get
[23943.19s -> 23944.79s]  When I was 15
[23944.79s -> 23948.79s]  And I would just make the same unit and send them all to death and then I would smash my keyboard
[23949.59s -> 23951.91s]  Um went through a lot of keyboards when I was like 14
[23952.79s -> 23961.20s]  The thing they were just amazon basics 12 dollar keyboards. That's not canon. I know that that actually isn't canon
[23962.76s -> 23967.80s]  Now today was canon no just because last week was non-canon that that that doesn't bleed into the
[23968.76s -> 23976.20s]  And plus I retroactively made two streams from last week canon. Just wait, we're gonna play nancy drew again next week. Anyways
[23978.61s -> 23981.65s]  I'm gonna do the nancy drew like once a week for the next like
[23982.77s -> 23987.51s]  Year until people are so sick of it
[23989.84s -> 23998.20s]  No, but thank you for the five subs at the starfish and atma gives 500 bits here right after that
[23998.20s -> 24000.20s]  They said do you ever play red alert 2?
[24000.44s -> 24002.60s]  Yep, that's also a fantastic game
[24005.04s -> 24010.48s]  Slight frustrations aside with red alert. It's still that holds up pretty well
[24012.82s -> 24015.46s]  It's that still holds up
[24016.42s -> 24018.42s]  20 fucking years later
[24018.42s -> 24028.68s]  I can't imagine how red alert 2 holds up. But yes, I did play most of the time I played was red alert 1
[24029.60s -> 24031.60s]  Red alert 2 I was kind of
[24034.02s -> 24036.58s]  I didn't get I look I didn't get it. I never got it
[24037.97s -> 24039.97s]  Especially when I was younger. I didn't get it
[24040.37s -> 24042.77s]  You know when you play dark souls for the first time ever
[24043.41s -> 24047.65s]  Uh when dark souls first came out or demon souls first came out and nobody like understood what the fuck was going on
[24048.05s -> 24050.04s]  You just don't get it
[24050.04s -> 24055.32s]  Go watch my first dark souls video. That's a person that just doesn't understand what the game even is supposed to be
[24059.54s -> 24061.22s]  That's kind of how I was with rtss
[24061.22s -> 24065.94s]  I just didn't I just made units and fight I didn't because there's no strategy and I still don't even know what i'm doing
[24067.80s -> 24070.60s]  Point is it's a never-ending process trying to figure out, you know what to do
[24076.93s -> 24079.09s]  But yeah, I do I do love the old rts games
[24079.57s -> 24082.69s]  Warcraft 3 is another one that I was really into most of the custom games though
[24083.65s -> 24087.89s]  I loved the tower defense games people would be really angry people would talk shit to me all the time though
[24087.89s -> 24089.81s]  Because I was so stupid and so bad
[24089.81s -> 24094.21s]  Remember the tower defense games custom games where you had to work together and build towers together and make
[24094.93s -> 24098.29s]  the big tubes together so the monsters will actually have a
[24099.09s -> 24100.93s]  trail to go on
[24100.93s -> 24105.49s]  I would just do wrong stuff and people would be like, what are you doing? You're an idiot
[24105.57s -> 24108.93s]  Why are you building that there stop doing that you fucked up the whole line
[24109.49s -> 24112.53s]  And I'd be like, I don't I don't know. I just I wanted to shoot a guy
[24118.79s -> 24120.63s]  I loved tower defense
[24120.63s -> 24122.63s]  I there's one game mode in particular
[24123.03s -> 24125.19s]  In warcraft 3 that I was obsessed with
[24125.91s -> 24127.99s]  It was hero line war
[24128.71s -> 24130.77s]  And I am shocked
[24130.77s -> 24132.13s]  that people have
[24132.13s -> 24134.13s]  put so much time and energy and effort
[24135.03s -> 24136.23s]  into
[24136.23s -> 24137.19s]  the
[24137.19s -> 24139.19s]  defense of the ancient stuff
[24139.27s -> 24141.27s]  And not the hero line war stuff
[24141.75s -> 24146.95s]  Because you made money and then had to send units to the other team's
[24147.59s -> 24148.98s]  line
[24148.98s -> 24154.02s]  And you made money by killing other heroes that came over to fight you or by killing monsters and you could keep
[24154.66s -> 24156.26s]  uh
[24156.26s -> 24160.82s]  You could send crazy crazy expensive monsters if you wanted to and they had to deal with them. It was two teams
[24161.78s -> 24165.83s]  hero line war was seriously the the best custom game mode and
[24167.43s -> 24172.32s]  Nobody gave a shit
[24172.32s -> 24175.36s]  I would I did I did I went back in warcraft 3 and even starcraft
[24176.00s -> 24178.64s]  dota all-stars dota all-stars dota all-stars
[24178.72s -> 24184.85s]  I would refresh the custom game list over and over again because I just didn't want to play dota and you would get that one
[24185.57s -> 24192.13s]  Custom game lobby that was open that wasn't dota all-stars and you're like, holy shit. Thank god. Somebody's playing something else
[24192.69s -> 24206.87s]  It was so much fun. There were a ton of custom games as well. I hope they bring that shit back
[24207.59s -> 24209.59s]  It was an awesome thing to do
[24210.52s -> 24213.08s]  But you know, I could go off for a million years here
[24214.04s -> 24217.24s]  Trident jacks. Thanks for the 500 bits have been really sick these past few days
[24217.72s -> 24220.12s]  Watching your videos has helped me through some of the rougher nights
[24220.68s -> 24223.36s]  much love and appreciation
[24223.36s -> 24234.12s]  Thank you trident. Sorry to hear you're not feeling well get well soon. Hopefully you get better soon stream, uh reforged
[24234.20s -> 24235.40s]  That's a plan
[24235.40s -> 24241.48s]  I'm sure it'll be really really active. So i'll definitely do it
[24244.10s -> 24247.54s]  Juno upsetto. Thanks for the five community subs. I think I missed it. Thank you
[24248.18s -> 24251.84s]  With five gifted subs
[24251.84s -> 24256.37s]  Should you go back to the fridge to get one more pickle? Uh, that depends how many pickles have you already had?
[24257.33s -> 24262.36s]  I'd like to know tell me i'm good. I i bob
[24263.16s -> 24265.40s]  How many pickles one? Oh go get two
[24266.12s -> 24269.36s]  Yeah, that's fine
[24269.36s -> 24272.00s]  Uh, but thank you juno upset over the five community subs. Thank you
[24272.56s -> 24279.44s]  Goop snatch for the uh, that's not even the right amount of i've just didn't mean right say that I finally watched Aladdin though. It was good
[24281.97s -> 24283.97s]  Yeah, it is. It's a really good movie
[24284.29s -> 24293.51s]  Aladdin's awesome the original laden. I'm glad you got to watch it
[24295.70s -> 24300.18s]  Marvosh Magali, thanks for the 250. I love seeing you play these boomer games. I mean old gems
[24301.06s -> 24303.06s]  Any plan to play some old?
[24303.94s -> 24307.06s]  Mame games. What is main meme?
[24307.94s -> 24310.08s]  What is that?
[24310.08s -> 24315.27s]  And they say is it against tos?
[24318.96s -> 24320.87s]  uh
[24320.87s -> 24322.88s]  arcade games
[24322.88s -> 24324.85s]  oh
[24324.85s -> 24327.01s]  There are actually a lot that would be fun to play
[24327.73s -> 24331.83s]  I mean it's for some of most of the ones that you can't even
[24332.47s -> 24336.93s]  Play anymore would be fine
[24336.93s -> 24339.81s]  But yeah, I've thought about arcade cabinet type games before
[24340.37s -> 24342.37s]  The issue is a lot of the arcade
[24342.93s -> 24347.09s]  Cabinets that I would want to play came out on like another console like dream caster or something
[24347.81s -> 24353.00s]  But the ones that didn't it would be fun
[24353.00s -> 24357.56s]  It's been up to set it up correctly
[24357.56s -> 24362.20s]  C4g, thanks for the 250 germa used to never do war crimes pepe hands
[24362.84s -> 24369.65s]  What are you talking about? Demonic cucumber. Thanks for the 250

[24373.47s -> 24376.85s]  Lul this meme was made by i'm there gang
[24382.56s -> 24384.56s]  Thank you for the 250

[24419.24s -> 24421.62s]  Well, I said it twice

[24438.31s -> 24440.31s]  But it looks like i've put it off for a month
[24440.71s -> 24443.85s]  I guess final projects aren't the only thing I procrastinate
[24444.47s -> 24448.47s]  Kind of be looking forward to the fuck the king minecraft stream hoping to participate in that maybe
[24449.92s -> 24451.20s]  I hope so
[24451.20s -> 24453.94s]  There's going to be some very strict rules on the server
[24455.08s -> 24459.16s]  That have to be in place there's a ton of stuff back end that is being done
[24460.04s -> 24465.16s]  To make this go as smoothly as possible. Although there's I mean, it's this whole thing is a beta. Anyways, it's just an experiment
[24466.20s -> 24469.40s]  Tease us about it
[24469.40s -> 24471.88s]  Just wait for tomorrow tomorrow. I'm gonna go over the whole thing tomorrow
[24472.44s -> 24476.32s]  How many people at once it is a I think it's a
[24477.04s -> 24479.04s]  500 plus server
[24479.12s -> 24482.96s]  So i'm not sure it's the exact number but it's at least 500 people
[24483.68s -> 24496.45s]  That can be in the server at the same time and there's a lot of things that have to go into place to make it
[24496.53s -> 24498.37s]  So it works
[24498.37s -> 24500.37s]  Not enough
[24501.09s -> 24504.69s]  Once you cross like three or four hundred people in the same spot
[24505.73s -> 24507.49s]  You start to run into
[24507.49s -> 24509.97s]  Uh, not possible anymore
[24511.33s -> 24512.37s]  We'll see
[24512.37s -> 24519.06s]  It should be a lot of fun. We're gonna break the server
[24520.84s -> 24525.17s]  I don't think you will
[24525.17s -> 24529.09s]  There's a lot of stuff that's being done to help with that. So don't worry
[24531.00s -> 24532.04s]  I am, uh
[24532.04s -> 24534.04s]  Putting the necessary resources in
[24534.76s -> 24536.76s]  Let's just put it this way. I'm not
[24537.91s -> 24542.07s]  I'm not running this on like a pentium i5 in my basement
[24544.00s -> 24546.40s]  There's uh, there's a lot of legit hardware here
[24547.20s -> 24555.64s]  Because it has to be
[24555.64s -> 24558.90s]  But we'll talk about it tomorrow
[24559.62s -> 24562.88s]  I'll have way more to tell you tomorrow
[24562.96s -> 24564.48s]  Internet Jorge

[24585.40s -> 24588.12s]  At least once a week right once or twice a week
[24591.20s -> 24596.16s]  How fucked up would it be if this was real and shit and my brain was making this whole thing up?
[24597.27s -> 24598.87s]  Can you imagine that?
[24598.87s -> 24612.92s]  He's so close
[24612.92s -> 24620.55s]  None of this is real. It's not but thank you for the 15 dollars. That's a lot of bits
[24621.67s -> 24623.75s]  Appreciate it. I hopefully I'll wake up

[24634.77s -> 24636.93s]  15 bucks from hypo cube
[24637.65s -> 24639.73s]  Glad you got around to playing this goofy delight of a game
[24639.73s -> 24643.33s]  I'm so happy when you squealed with excitement yesterday about playing this on stream
[24643.89s -> 24649.65s]  This dream brought back so many good memories of being a kid working my way around rts's and I wanted to thank you for it
[24650.13s -> 24652.77s]  You should play too sometime. I hear the fmv gets even better
[24653.57s -> 24659.67s]  Yeah, I love this game
[24659.67s -> 24662.07s]  that really is great, you know what my favorite part about this game is
[24664.21s -> 24665.33s]  the
[24665.33s -> 24676.68s]  Construction site opening that's my favorite part and it still holds up
[24677.32s -> 24680.64s]  But thank you for the 1500 bits
[24680.88s -> 24683.38s]  I will probably end up playing too at some point
[24684.45s -> 24689.73s]  Dark soul. Thanks for the 250. Hi. Wow. Great stream. Where do you stand on the twerking fiasco?
[24689.81s -> 24694.13s]  What I really didn't know so I can read so I can refund these bits if you disagree with me
[24695.09s -> 24699.70s]  I don't know what I don't know what this is and I don't know what it's working for you. I don't know what a twerking fiasco is
[24703.72s -> 24706.60s]  Is uh, I don't know. I don't know who that is
[24707.48s -> 24709.48s]  I don't even know that I don't know what that is
[24711.94s -> 24715.86s]  I've never heard that name before. I don't know what that is. I don't want I don't know
[24718.39s -> 24721.59s]  I don't twerk. I don't know but I don't care about twerking twerking. I don't care
[24722.31s -> 24725.76s]  There you go. There's my stance
[24725.76s -> 24730.00s]  Apple ship. Thanks for the 250. Hey, do you have a set date for the next community content night?

[24747.22s -> 24752.18s]  I want to get in front of the green screen and that's I have to wait a little bit
[24752.58s -> 24756.26s]  I kind of planned this all and then it all fucked up because of my illness
[24757.22s -> 24759.19s]  but
[24759.19s -> 24760.36s]  I
[24760.36s -> 24764.22s]  The new year's eve stream with the award ceremony
[24765.18s -> 24769.02s]  The green screens that has to happen first the minecraft has to happen first
[24769.74s -> 24772.04s]  There's a lot going on in the next like four weeks
[24772.92s -> 24775.00s]  so and I really really wanted to get the
[24775.64s -> 24778.12s]  green screen footage for the next community content night, but
[24778.84s -> 24782.04s]  If it can't happen, I can't happen. It'll be for the next one after january

[24891.05s -> 24894.33s]  And thankfully there's enough time because remember last year it was like a
[24894.97s -> 24896.97s]  Whole shit. Uh, that's what I want to do
[24897.21s -> 24901.37s]  Uh worst of the year best of the year and we did that shit in like four days
[24901.37s -> 24904.95s]  Do you guys remember that we did that in less than three or four days?
[24905.59s -> 24912.79s]  It was like less had to I remember it was like december 26 or something when I was like, okay nominate
[24914.39s -> 24917.45s]  So this time we're gonna have a good full week of nominations
[24920.01s -> 24922.28s]  And plenty of time to put it together
[24922.28s -> 24924.28s]  It would it might have been less than two or three days
[24926.41s -> 24933.10s]  last year
[24933.10s -> 24935.10s]  But I I loved it
[24936.63s -> 24938.47s]  But we'll have more time
[24938.47s -> 24940.55s]  And that is happening on new year's eve
[24942.55s -> 24947.99s]  Of course, but pin thanks for the 250 pin
[24948.79s -> 24952.47s]  once I showed up to a black tie symphony for
[24953.67s -> 24960.23s]  Tchaikov Tchaikovsky in some crappy shorts in a shirt during the intermission. They were setting up some sort of after party
[24961.38s -> 24966.10s]  I was chatting with the help and he let me snag a few glasses of wine for free
[24967.59s -> 24969.91s]  Uh little did I know it's the wine that gets you destroyed
[24970.87s -> 24974.39s]  So I stumbled back into the symphony and it's suddenly the greatest music i've ever heard
[24975.43s -> 24981.59s]  Afterward, I hung out with some old rich guy who hated his wife and then I got hit on by that guy
[25001.94s -> 25008.87s]  That's an odd story but it's that's a that's something that you can tell that's a story to tell
[25009.59s -> 25021.16s]  Well, this is the best music ever I love this music what does it go like
[25023.56s -> 25037.24s]  What's that one it's not that
[25037.56s -> 25041.43s]  But thank you pin for the 250. Thank you sticks renegade for the 250
[25041.51s -> 25046.07s]  It's almost that time of year again my birthday's on christmas since there's no christmas stream surprised me with a random
[25046.07s -> 25050.71s]  Happy birthday like last year and the year before happy birthday sticks renegade

[25054.39s -> 25059.11s]  But there will be a stream like probably a few days before christmas or like that week before christmas
[25059.35s -> 25065.03s]  So you'll get i'll be live on christmas not that i'm just i've rewind that not gonna be live on christmas to make that very clear
[25065.03s -> 25070.23s]  No christmas stream this year the minecraft stream and the new year's eve stream gonna be taking the place of anything that would be christmas related
[25071.11s -> 25073.27s]  We'll see a few days before christmas happy birthday
[25074.07s -> 25086.71s]  Let's get to the end. See you guys tomorrow for the game awards. We have a couple more bits we have
[25087.35s -> 25089.35s]  Bot squire, thanks for the 500 bits
[25090.65s -> 25092.41s]  it's uh, just
[25092.49s -> 25096.01s]  Me, I don't know what i'm doing here. It's probably probably playing a thing game of the year
[25099.06s -> 25101.94s]  And those eyes are real even though they might not be though
[25104.52s -> 25106.52s]  Those eyes could be doctored
[25108.22s -> 25113.29s]  I think they actually are
[25113.29s -> 25114.49s]  Yeah
[25114.49s -> 25117.21s]  Somebody fucked up somebody did something with my pupils. That's weird
[25124.04s -> 25126.04s]  Those things streams
[25126.28s -> 25128.79s]  What a hoot
[25128.79s -> 25130.79s]  Let's examine this for a second
[25130.87s -> 25134.26s]  I want to I want you to see
[25136.34s -> 25142.49s]  Let's zoom into the eyes
[25142.57s -> 25146.28s]  We're going late tonight. Damn
[25146.28s -> 25154.95s]  Why do I still even have this on the desktop?
[25156.10s -> 25158.10s]  So that's the one
[25158.10s -> 25160.10s]  I can't believe I thought this was real
[25160.98s -> 25163.06s]  I can't fucking believe I thought that was real
[25171.96s -> 25176.73s]  that's not the image though see people have gotten smart and
[25181.45s -> 25183.45s]  They doctor it in a way
[25184.26s -> 25190.86s]  Those eyes aren't real
[25190.86s -> 25192.86s]  Right. I don't think they are
[25203.40s -> 25205.72s]  I don't I don't it's just pupils
[25206.52s -> 25209.46s]  There's nothing there's no definition to the it's just pupils
[25219.46s -> 25221.38s]  You have a shitty camera
[25221.38s -> 25223.40s]  Hey
[25223.40s -> 25225.40s]  Don't be mean to my camera
[25228.47s -> 25229.99s]  Hey, thank you pin
[25229.99s -> 25232.39s]  For the 250 is this doctored? Hold on
[25235.22s -> 25245.91s]  Nope
[25260.39s -> 25265.82s]  Oh my god, where's my spine?
[25281.72s -> 25283.72s]  Beer belly and nerd neck
[25291.98s -> 25297.94s]  Okay, i'm out of here i'm out of here is this doctored I don't know
[25301.61s -> 25303.91s]  What are you guys getting these
[25311.61s -> 25313.61s]  Let me see if this one's doctored
[25315.91s -> 25321.14s]  What was this called?
[25321.14s -> 25335.77s]  Where is it? I mean that's where the image comes from
[25337.88s -> 25341.88s]  I think that they fucked with it though. They fucked with it. Look at the mouth
[25342.68s -> 25344.84s]  You did this is doctored. Look at the mouth
[25347.62s -> 25350.50s]  This a hundred percent has been met has been doctored
[25362.63s -> 25364.63s]  All right. Good. I'll see you tomorrow for the game awards
[25365.11s -> 25369.99s]  I can't wait
[25369.99s -> 25374.87s]  Oh, yeah, I should have a couple of bits pin. Thanks for the 250 right? I didn't even say it. Thanks for the 250 though
[25375.91s -> 25379.43s]  Uh say ha I used to get yelled at all the time when I was like 10
[25380.15s -> 25381.67s]  Because I would run
[25381.67s -> 25383.19s]  straight skeleton
[25383.19s -> 25386.71s]  Necro on diablo 2 go to cow runs and kill the cow king
[25387.51s -> 25389.51s]  Wow, you're the worst kind of person in the world
[25390.47s -> 25396.58s]  You you you went in there you killed the cow king on purpose
[25399.98s -> 25406.49s]  Wow, yeah, so that's unbearable. I can't believe you would do something like that you dick
[25407.53s -> 25415.96s]  Those of you that don't know the cow king if you killed the cow king in a server
[25416.84s -> 25421.54s]  Nobody else in that game could play the cow like it couldn't make the cow lever ever again
[25422.34s -> 25427.38s]  You essentially turned off everybody in that game from being able to physically open the portal again
[25428.18s -> 25430.18s]  You had to make another character
[25431.42s -> 25434.54s]  That was back when you could have like 20 skeletons it would lag everyone out
[25435.18s -> 25440.86s]  It was called the lag romancer. I never understood why everyone was upset with me because I was having the time of my life
[25446.36s -> 25447.80s]  Yeah, I miss
[25447.80s -> 25449.80s]  playing diablo 2 necromancer
[25450.44s -> 25454.92s]  Having 50 things on screen run around. You just don't have to do eat a sandwich and play the game
[25458.89s -> 25464.25s]  Maybe one day i'll do like a hardcore diablo 2 thing would just beat him with anyone that wants to play
[25465.86s -> 25467.30s]  And I just play
[25467.30s -> 25469.30s]  uh necromancer
[25471.77s -> 25474.81s]  What this would just be fuck the king again, except i'm a necromancer this time
[25482.97s -> 25490.31s]  D2 paladin. Yeah, that sounds like the worst stream ever
[25494.23s -> 25497.37s]  Come on the time to the game awards start
[25498.63s -> 25501.77s]  530 pacific they started right game. Let's see
[25506.22s -> 25508.22s]  the game awards are
[25509.85s -> 25510.97s]  Yeah
[25510.97s -> 25518.76s]  8 30 pm eastern 5 30 pacific i'll see you for that stream
[25523.00s -> 25529.11s]  The 8 30 eastern am I going to stream before that? I will not be streaming before that
[25530.22s -> 25533.10s]  Before that i'm going to be in the minecraft server
[25534.81s -> 25540.01s]  Getting stuff ready because that stream is happening in like four days
[25540.81s -> 25542.81s]  So I need to take some time to get it ready
[25544.65s -> 25550.41s]  But i'll be live. I would assume like at least 10 minutes or so before the stream starts so I can get it ready
[25550.49s -> 25552.49s]  We can be watching it
[25552.49s -> 25554.17s]  so
[25554.17s -> 25558.86s]  Did germa ever tell the oreo story one time I ate a bunch of oreos and threw from my mother's bed
[25567.32s -> 25570.76s]  Finally we have wembley t tv for the 250 germa
[25571.00s -> 25573.48s]  You've been in a coma for nine years after the helicopter crash
[25573.80s -> 25577.24s]  We had to plug you into the internet and you you're stuck in a vr simulation
[25578.28s -> 25580.47s]  Please wake up
[25580.47s -> 25588.60s]  I maybe I will
[25589.00s -> 25593.48s]  I'll stream starting soon
[25593.56s -> 25596.38s]  You'll get moments like this
[25596.38s -> 25605.51s]  All right. Good night guys. See you tomorrow for the game awards and we'll have a lot to talk about tomorrow after the game awards
[25605.75s -> 25608.44s]  a lot
[25608.44s -> 25614.57s]  Good night. Take care
