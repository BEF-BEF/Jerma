[5.06s -> 10.19s]  How's it going? Well, I should wait a few minutes.
[12.05s -> 18.18s]  Sometimes I forget free rolls exist on Twitch, but I'm here.
[19.58s -> 21.66s]  All right, let's give it a minute. I'll be right back.
[42.77s -> 48.37s]  This community is so funny. I love this place. I'll tell you a couple of reasons why.
[48.37s -> 61.79s]  First of all, everybody in here is so excited, not for sorcery, not for any announcements.
[62.59s -> 67.63s]  The most exciting thing is me taking a bite out of a BLT.
[68.59s -> 72.88s]  It's like, this is a huge deal.
[73.68s -> 77.28s]  Oh, BLT, let's go. No way. Is he going to eat a BLT?
[78.24s -> 81.04s]  Tons of streamers eat food every day on stream.
[84.24s -> 91.14s]  In fact, there's probably right now, there's probably five to 10,000 different streamers
[91.14s -> 95.62s]  right now across the whole website eating food right now.
[96.34s -> 107.55s]  I actually haven't had a BLT in a long time, but we're not doing that immediately.
[108.27s -> 113.15s]  I want to wait till a little bit later. We need to wait till most people are here.
[113.79s -> 123.28s]  Is it a turkey BLT? Nope. It's just bread, a little coating of mayonnaise,
[124.94s -> 128.70s]  lettuce, tomato, bacon, toasted.
[128.70s -> 132.78s]  Well, let's not get crazy here. Let's not get crazy.
[138.11s -> 145.31s]  What do you mean mayo with question marks? You eat dry ass BLTs? Who does that?
[145.87s -> 150.72s]  You just put lettuce, tomato, and bacon in between bread?
[151.92s -> 159.63s]  That's dry. But the tomato, yeah, mayo is always on a BLT.
[160.59s -> 164.05s]  Always. I don't want that dry bread.
[164.77s -> 168.06s]  But yeah, let's go over it. Let's talk about some stuff.
[168.06s -> 170.06s]  Today is a very eventful day.
[170.94s -> 173.42s]  Not just the fact that we're starting Sorcery Part 4.
[174.56s -> 179.68s]  So yes, people thought I was a liar. We're doing Sorcery 4 today.
[179.68s -> 180.32s]  We're going to start it.
[181.38s -> 190.42s]  We're also going to talk about Grotto Beasts and the Grotto Beasts tabletop simulator mod.
[191.46s -> 197.54s]  I have some photos to show you. It's really, really, really nice.
[197.54s -> 203.02s]  Some news about that. Also something else to talk about.
[203.58s -> 205.67s]  You'll see.
[206.21s -> 212.40s]  And then, of course, the bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo sandwich.
[217.92s -> 218.96s]  We know what it is.
[218.96s -> 220.16s]  I don't think you do.
[221.97s -> 223.97s]  I talked in free stream today.
[225.31s -> 227.39s]  That is not what this is.
[227.39s -> 228.19s]  This is different.
[228.19s -> 230.43s]  And I think it's going to surprise a lot of people.
[230.43s -> 232.67s]  I think a lot of you might know what this thing is.
[233.39s -> 236.19s]  But it's not what we were talking about in free stream.
[237.07s -> 237.95s]  It's something else.
[241.65s -> 243.57s]  I'm already shocked.
[243.57s -> 244.77s]  How many bites am I going to take?
[245.41s -> 247.15s]  I don't know.
[247.15s -> 247.65s]  A few.
[248.19s -> 249.15s]  I might eat the whole sandwich.
[249.15s -> 249.65s]  I don't know.
[254.66s -> 256.90s]  Eat an egg salad sandwich instead.
[256.90s -> 261.07s]  Stop stalling.
[262.06s -> 263.66s]  I think we have to stall today.
[263.66s -> 266.38s]  Because at the Sorcery Council, I need to make sure they're here.
[267.18s -> 269.65s]  The whole thing.
[271.38s -> 274.42s]  I might eat half and save half for later or something.
[275.06s -> 277.15s]  You should raid somebody right now.
[277.95s -> 280.56s]  Just start turning my streams on to raid people.
[283.14s -> 284.66s]  Hey, welcome to the stream, everybody.
[285.22s -> 286.34s]  Big day today.
[288.22s -> 289.10s]  Okay, who are we raiding?
[292.35s -> 293.95s]  I actually want to do that at some point.
[294.51s -> 296.94s]  Hey, the shit we were talking about in free stream today.
[297.74s -> 298.54s]  I'm going to do that.
[298.54s -> 299.90s]  I'm going to do that shit.
[299.90s -> 300.46s]  It's going to happen.
[300.46s -> 301.10s]  I'm going to do that.
[301.82s -> 302.54s]  I hope you're ready.
[312.67s -> 315.63s]  Unfortunately, for the Sorcery High Council.
[315.63s -> 319.71s]  But wait, somebody on the Sorcery High Council is at work right now?
[320.43s -> 320.93s]  Uh-oh.
[323.68s -> 326.53s]  Well, how many people are on this council?
[330.42s -> 332.58s]  We talk about the Sorcery High Council.
[332.58s -> 335.73s]  I feel like it's like 2,000 people.
[341.57s -> 343.57s]  It's at least a few thousand people.
[346.96s -> 348.64s]  How are we ever going to get anything done?
[349.36s -> 353.70s]  If there's like 5,000 of us that need to be present for every single vote
[353.70s -> 356.74s]  that we do for the Sorcery High Council.
[357.46s -> 358.86s]  How do we do anything?
[359.50s -> 361.82s]  You have to be like present in the room.
[363.10s -> 364.62s]  There's like 15.
[364.62s -> 367.34s]  Imagine if there was like 15,000 senators.
[369.55s -> 372.51s]  Everybody must be in attendance when we take these votes.
[373.23s -> 377.73s]  This is a stadium full of people all screaming at each other.
[378.37s -> 389.01s]  Oh, they do.
[389.01s -> 391.09s]  No, they do that in Star Wars?
[391.09s -> 391.89s]  Is that? That looks like.
[391.89s -> 393.01s]  Okay, that's Star Wars.
[396.83s -> 397.47s]  Oh, that's right.
[397.47s -> 400.75s]  I forgot about the Galactic Senate.
[404.08s -> 405.68s]  It's a Star Wars Senate.
[405.68s -> 406.18s]  Yeah.
[406.64s -> 413.86s]  So I forget what happens in Star Wars.
[413.86s -> 414.66s]  How did, um.
[417.25s -> 419.97s]  I was just called a fucking Senator of Pompadour.
[420.61s -> 421.33s]  What's his name?
[421.33s -> 421.81s]  Why do I?
[421.81s -> 423.17s]  It's Palpatine.
[429.36s -> 431.04s]  I am the Senate.
[431.04s -> 433.04s]  Did he just get to say and do whatever he wanted?
[433.04s -> 433.52s]  How did that work?
[433.52s -> 434.16s]  How did that work?
[434.80s -> 436.96s]  There were like 20,000 people in that room.
[437.68s -> 439.63s]  How did he?
[440.43s -> 441.86s]  What do you mean spoilers?
[443.65s -> 446.13s]  Guys, Star Wars spoilers are.
[447.33s -> 450.53s]  They're ingrained in human society.
[451.65s -> 452.45s]  Humanity.
[453.09s -> 455.25s]  There are Star Wars.
[455.25s -> 458.48s]  Original trilogy spoiler is like.
[459.78s -> 462.98s]  That's like saying that Gollum is in Lord of the Rings.
[469.84s -> 471.52s]  They gave him emergency powers.
[472.08s -> 473.20s]  Oh, right.
[473.20s -> 474.08s]  Those are the prequels.
[478.16s -> 480.80s]  Oh, I never saw those.
[480.80s -> 482.40s]  I never saw those ones.
[487.15s -> 491.31s]  I just saw like six or seven YouTube shorts of like.
[493.14s -> 494.50s]  I think Empire Strikes Back.
[494.50s -> 495.38s]  I've never even seen the movies.
[495.38s -> 496.50s]  I have no idea how it even happens.
[497.06s -> 503.76s]  Of course, you watch shorts.
[504.96s -> 506.32s]  Can I talk about shorts for a second?
[511.17s -> 513.01s]  When I scroll YouTube shorts.
[513.73s -> 516.45s]  I do it for a few minutes or even it doesn't matter.
[516.45s -> 519.17s]  If I do YouTube shorts for a little while, I just kind of sit there and I'm like.
[520.46s -> 522.70s]  I have to do something else like I have to.
[522.70s -> 524.94s]  I have to clean my mind like it's just.
[525.58s -> 527.50s]  It's sometimes it's just chaos over there.
[528.22s -> 529.02s]  It's just chaos.
[535.49s -> 537.89s]  If I scroll shorts for like 30, 40 minutes.
[538.90s -> 540.02s]  That's a lot, right?
[540.02s -> 543.63s]  And it's like, holy shit, how long have I been doing this for now?
[543.63s -> 545.15s]  Let me tell you, I've only done this.
[546.86s -> 549.26s]  Maybe three or four times ever.
[550.14s -> 551.58s]  Maybe four times ever.
[552.46s -> 553.74s]  Who scrolls for 40?
[555.89s -> 556.45s]  I don't know.
[556.45s -> 557.41s]  I don't know how it works.
[557.41s -> 557.97s]  I don't know.
[557.97s -> 559.81s]  What am I supposed to stop scrolling?
[559.81s -> 561.17s]  What am I supposed to stop?
[564.94s -> 566.78s]  Just watch TikTok and said, I don't want.
[566.78s -> 568.30s]  I don't want to watch either one of them.
[568.94s -> 571.39s]  I mean, some of them are cool.
[571.39s -> 575.15s]  Like, you know, you go through, you're like, whoa, holy shit.
[576.11s -> 579.55s]  I can't fucking believe that bottle made it all the way down and didn't break.
[580.27s -> 581.71s]  That's fucking unbelievable.
[592.29s -> 594.13s]  He watches the bottle ones.
[596.13s -> 600.27s]  YouTube shorts are fucking insane.
[602.30s -> 602.80s]  Yeah.
[603.26s -> 605.42s]  Like Subway surfer's sludge.
[607.82s -> 609.42s]  Dude, I don't know anything about it.
[609.42s -> 611.90s]  All I know is the few times I've done it, I've gone.
[612.62s -> 613.30s]  All right.
[613.30s -> 613.86s]  That was all right.
[613.86s -> 617.90s]  I'm, uh, I'm good for a little while.
[617.90s -> 618.38s]  Yeah.
[618.38s -> 620.14s]  I've seen the entire skibbity toilet.
[620.14s -> 621.66s]  I've seen all of them except for the last.
[621.66s -> 622.78s]  Like I got to catch up.
[624.03s -> 629.07s]  Is it bad that I've seen all of skibbity toilet, but I stopped watching Better Call Saul at
[629.07s -> 629.63s]  season two?
[630.85s -> 632.13s]  I don't know why I do these things.
[632.69s -> 633.57s]  It's just, I don't know.
[634.13s -> 635.17s]  Is this bad?
[635.17s -> 636.05s]  But whatever.
[636.05s -> 636.53s]  It's okay.
[637.49s -> 641.97s]  If the entirety of skibbity toilet is what?
[641.97s -> 644.61s]  Like third, 20 total minutes, 30 minutes.
[644.61s -> 646.05s]  What is skibbity toilet?
[646.05s -> 647.09s]  I don't know.
[647.09s -> 647.73s]  I don't know.
[647.73s -> 652.21s]  I just, I just was on one and it was like, I'm like, okay, just go to the next one.
[652.21s -> 652.93s]  Go, go, go.
[652.93s -> 653.81s]  40 minutes later.
[653.81s -> 654.45s]  That's what happened.
[654.45s -> 655.49s]  That's what happened.
[655.49s -> 662.90s]  I just lost respect for you.
[663.46s -> 664.59s]  Yeah.
[666.67s -> 667.79s]  I'm dying right now.
[667.79s -> 669.07s]  You need to grow up.
[669.07s -> 671.47s]  Oh, grown ass man.
[671.55s -> 673.39s]  Oh, fucking grown ass, man.
[673.39s -> 674.03s]  I don't even know.
[674.03s -> 675.63s]  I have, maybe I haven't seen it all.
[675.63s -> 682.46s]  It's hard to tell, bro.
[682.46s -> 683.34s]  You're 40.
[683.34s -> 686.30s]  I don't know how these, I don't, I'm not like a shorts guy.
[686.30s -> 689.34s]  I don't, I'm look, I'm wanting to maybe get back into YouTube.
[690.06s -> 692.22s]  Talk about that another time, but I don't know.
[692.22s -> 694.46s]  Maybe, maybe do I, should I make some shorts or something?
[694.46s -> 695.50s]  Maybe I can make some fun ones.
[695.50s -> 695.90s]  I don't know.
[696.54s -> 698.27s]  Remember you're 40.
[698.27s -> 698.91s]  Not yet.
[698.91s -> 699.31s]  Almost.
[700.11s -> 702.83s]  That's the last time you saw an entire TV show.
[705.54s -> 705.94s]  All right.
[706.74s -> 709.70s]  I have to, we have to, I gotta, I know I'm stalling, but mods.
[709.70s -> 710.58s]  Can we do a poll, please?
[710.58s -> 712.26s]  And answer this truthfully?
[712.26s -> 714.18s]  Because I know people are going, oh my God, dude.
[714.18s -> 715.62s]  You can't believe you fucking watched that.
[715.62s -> 716.58s]  How did you, really?
[716.58s -> 717.94s]  You watched Skimity Toilet?
[718.90s -> 719.78s]  How many of you have seen it?
[720.50s -> 723.26s]  How many of you have seen it?
[723.26s -> 725.18s]  Like, I want like a real answer of you.
[725.18s -> 726.62s]  Have you seen at least 10 of them?
[727.26s -> 728.83s]  Yeah.
[728.83s -> 730.51s]  And I want it to be answered truthfully.
[735.30s -> 742.00s]  Maybe, okay.
[742.56s -> 747.60s]  I think I watched the whole thing a while ago when there weren't the amount of episodes that exist.
[747.60s -> 752.88s]  Now it takes like three minutes.
[752.88s -> 753.28s]  Yeah.
[753.28s -> 753.52s]  All right.
[754.00s -> 754.88s]  Did you?
[754.88s -> 756.48s]  And I want real answers.
[756.48s -> 757.68s]  And don't you lie.
[757.68s -> 758.88s]  I know some of you are gonna.
[759.52s -> 765.89s]  All right.
[765.89s -> 770.37s]  We got a 20% yes, which means it's more like 40% yes.
[772.18s -> 774.18s]  The other 20% that are not voting yes.
[774.18s -> 776.90s]  You're in the same room with somebody that's like, oh yeah, Skimity Toilet.
[776.90s -> 777.78s]  Fucking what?
[777.78s -> 778.10s]  Yeah.
[778.10s -> 778.82s]  I'm voting no.
[780.06s -> 781.42s]  And you were like, yeah, me too.
[782.06s -> 782.82s]  Yeah.
[782.82s -> 784.18s]  It's at least 30% of you.
[784.90s -> 788.08s]  Whatever.
[788.08s -> 788.88s]  Whatever.
[788.88s -> 789.68s]  I watched it.
[789.68s -> 790.40s]  I watched some of it.
[790.40s -> 790.96s]  Whatever.
[790.96s -> 791.44s]  Who cares?
[792.32s -> 792.80s]  We're good.
[793.36s -> 796.86s]  20% means 20%.
[797.74s -> 800.16s]  It only means no.
[800.80s -> 802.16s]  It means like 30%.
[811.84s -> 815.28s]  Day 44 of asking you for a nun cosplay.
[815.92s -> 821.89s]  I saw a, like a trailer or like an image for like, there's like, there's another,
[821.89s -> 823.57s]  there's another like evil nun movie.
[824.37s -> 827.49s]  This October.
[828.05s -> 828.61s]  The Nun.
[829.41s -> 831.55s]  Hey, remember that movie with the nun?
[832.35s -> 833.78s]  Fucking evil nun.
[840.21s -> 842.29s]  We're really leaning into the evil nun.
[842.29s -> 850.48s]  The Nun 2.
[851.04s -> 857.20s]  It's a really, it's a really old trope.
[857.20s -> 857.36s]  Yeah.
[857.36s -> 858.88s]  Like the evil nun.
[865.06s -> 866.82s]  Watch the new Saw trailer.
[866.82s -> 867.70s]  No, I don't.
[868.42s -> 877.20s]  Yeah.
[877.20s -> 881.12s]  I watched Skimity Toilet because I was, I was curious because I heard people talking about it.
[881.76s -> 883.50s]  I was like, what is this?
[883.50s -> 885.34s]  And then I watched it for a little bit and I stopped.
[885.34s -> 886.38s]  I was like, okay, well, I'm done.
[888.38s -> 893.46s]  Vinny fought you in Rivals of Aether yesterday.
[893.46s -> 894.34s]  You won.
[894.34s -> 894.74s]  Thank you.
[895.54s -> 897.66s]  What's the lore?
[897.66s -> 898.38s]  I don't know.
[899.10s -> 904.00s]  Stop trying to justify it.
[904.00s -> 904.40s]  Yeah.
[904.40s -> 904.80s]  You know what?
[907.36s -> 909.55s]  I don't even, I don't even need to justify it.
[909.55s -> 909.95s]  I did it.
[910.75s -> 911.79s]  I watched it.
[911.79s -> 913.71s]  I need to justify the fact that I watched this.
[917.42s -> 918.78s]  Didn't Vinny watch this too?
[921.22s -> 922.82s]  Wait, Vinny, did Vinny watch this too?
[922.82s -> 923.14s]  Didn't he?
[923.70s -> 925.90s]  See, that's where I got the idea.
[925.90s -> 927.66s]  That's where I got the, that's where I got the idea.
[928.22s -> 929.34s]  That's where I got the idea.
[929.34s -> 932.54s]  I heard he was doing it and I was like, oh, I guess I'll watch this too.
[933.18s -> 943.65s]  Anyways, he's blaming Vinny.
[944.80s -> 946.24s]  Don't you blame Vinny.
[946.88s -> 949.58s]  Ludwig watched it.
[949.58s -> 950.70s]  Ludwig watched it too.
[951.50s -> 956.66s]  Hey, I'm going to blame other streamers for this.
[956.66s -> 957.94s]  It's, I didn't, it's not me.
[957.94s -> 960.74s]  I watched other streamers do it and I thought I was going to do it too.
[960.74s -> 961.46s]  It's not my fault.
[962.02s -> 965.20s]  But he said, fuck this guy.
[967.74s -> 968.14s]  All right.
[968.14s -> 969.90s]  I don't, I don't know the lore.
[969.90s -> 970.70s]  I don't care.
[971.58s -> 975.25s]  I don't need to, we're just going to move on because that's what we're doing.
[975.25s -> 976.05s]  Playing Sorcery.
[985.09s -> 985.81s]  There's lore.
[985.81s -> 986.77s]  I, yeah, I think so.
[986.77s -> 987.25s]  I don't know.
[989.54s -> 990.50s]  Do the voice.
[990.50s -> 991.38s]  Which, what voice?
[991.38s -> 1000.83s]  What are you talking about?
[1000.83s -> 1002.59s]  The high council has voted for you to move on.
[1003.47s -> 1012.54s]  Uh, well as, uh, as the Senator, King Senator.
[1013.10s -> 1016.24s]  I wanted to talk for a few minutes before we went.
[1016.24s -> 1017.76s]  So, all right, let's go.
[1018.48s -> 1019.44s]  Sorcery part four.
[1019.44s -> 1020.80s]  We have a lot of stuff to talk about later.
[1020.80s -> 1022.72s]  I, I'm going to wait until a little bit later though.
[1027.30s -> 1028.66s]  Sorcery enjoyers.
[1029.89s -> 1030.29s]  Let's go.
[1034.70s -> 1035.84s]  Okay.
[1035.84s -> 1037.76s]  So this is going to get, this is going to catch us up a little bit.
[1039.28s -> 1044.00s]  Long ago, or so they say, the ancient world was prosperous and free.
[1044.45s -> 1047.81s]  From the Kakabad Sea, to the lake, to Lake Lumle.
[1048.37s -> 1049.65s]  Harvests were plentiful.
[1049.65s -> 1052.96s]  People were happy.
[1052.96s -> 1053.84s]  All was at peace.
[1056.19s -> 1061.23s]  I may have been sitting at this screen for too long for the music to have played a few
[1061.23s -> 1062.75s]  times and no longer is playing.
[1062.75s -> 1070.32s]  All was at peace, even the thundering skies were calm, tamed by the arts of the sorcerers
[1070.32s -> 1071.12s]  of Mampang.
[1071.68s -> 1073.47s]  Then everything changed.
[1073.47s -> 1079.74s]  A fearsome sorcerer leveled the cities and turned the fields to dust with towers of devastating
[1079.74s -> 1080.93s]  light.
[1080.93s -> 1082.29s]  He heard no plea.
[1082.29s -> 1090.82s]  Cutting down village after village, the mages scrabbled to defend the ancient world, but
[1090.82s -> 1092.02s]  they were weak.
[1092.02s -> 1097.70s]  Finally, the last archmage sealed the walls of Mampang and sent out seven deadly serpents
[1097.70s -> 1101.70s]  to keep the dark sorcerer away.
[1101.70s -> 1107.15s]  All seven died.
[1107.15s -> 1111.47s]  And now here you are, climbing the narrow pass into the mountains of high Xamon.
[1111.47s -> 1115.49s]  The price of your journey across the backlands has already been paid.
[1115.49s -> 1121.79s]  Now, the Anoland is coming to Mampang and nothing will be allowed to stand in his path.
[1122.03s -> 1128.06s]  The crown will be yours.
[1128.06s -> 1132.48s]  Ladies and gentlemen, Inkle and...
[1132.48s -> 1153.15s]  ...Steve Jackson's Sorcery, part four, Crown of Kings.
[1153.15s -> 1159.04s]  Hey, there's the audio.
[1159.04s -> 1160.82s]  Okay, so here we...
[1160.82s -> 1164.37s]  To give you a recap, we beat the seven serpents.
[1165.01s -> 1167.33s]  We now are going for the archmage.
[1167.89s -> 1172.42s]  The archmage is the evil, evil archmage.
[1172.42s -> 1173.30s]  Where's the music?
[1173.30s -> 1174.50s]  It'll come up.
[1174.50s -> 1177.81s]  There's no sound.
[1177.81s -> 1178.77s]  Yeah, there is.
[1178.77s -> 1180.37s]  All right, here we are.
[1180.37s -> 1181.54s]  The sun begins to dip.
[1181.54s -> 1186.02s]  Heading towards the horizon, you climb an ancient staircase worn to almost nothing by
[1186.02s -> 1186.74s]  the years.
[1186.74s -> 1188.80s]  Look at the steps.
[1188.80s -> 1195.06s]  Long ago, these steps were etched with messages, warnings, and words of advice and succor to
[1195.06s -> 1197.70s]  the acolytes making the pilgrimage to the fortress.
[1197.70s -> 1202.45s]  But they have long since been scrubbed away by dust, and the remaining marks tell you
[1202.45s -> 1206.10s]  nothing.
[1206.10s -> 1207.30s]  Check my provisions.
[1207.30s -> 1211.02s]  You open your pack to check your provisions and nod with satisfaction.
[1211.02s -> 1214.93s]  You have enough for four meals, but that should be enough.
[1214.93s -> 1220.85s]  If you have not found the crown within four days, most likely it will be because you are
[1220.85s -> 1221.41s]  dead.
[1221.41s -> 1225.79s]  Okay, in the distance, black smoke curls upwards.
[1225.79s -> 1228.27s]  You have four BLTs.
[1228.27s -> 1234.26s]  Check the sword.
[1234.26s -> 1235.79s]  At least you have your blade.
[1235.79s -> 1240.11s]  You draw your assassin's sword an inch from its scabbard, its edge flashing in the dying
[1240.11s -> 1240.83s]  sunlight.
[1240.83s -> 1242.59s]  It is a fine, strong weapon.
[1242.98s -> 1246.38s]  You're well-armed for whatever terrors lie ahead.
[1246.38s -> 1251.36s]  Pulling up your hood against the chill air, you stride onwards through the meager mountain
[1251.36s -> 1252.46s]  sunlight.
[1252.46s -> 1253.98s]  You must not linger out here.
[1253.98s -> 1257.54s]  I don't want to do any spoilers.
[1257.54s -> 1260.29s]  He waited for the plus twos to come in.
[1260.29s -> 1267.89s]  Well, I read it in chat, so there already was a chat plus two, so I'm just talking about
[1267.89s -> 1269.30s]  it.
[1269.30s -> 1272.91s]  You reflect on your progress with a heavy heart as you climb.
[1272.91s -> 1277.09s]  The backlands were a cursed place, and your journey across them was slow.
[1277.09s -> 1278.38s]  Was it?
[1278.38s -> 1280.86s]  Even with the serpents defeated, caution would be wise.
[1280.86s -> 1285.10s]  It is possible that other messengers will have brought news of your presence to the
[1285.10s -> 1286.96s]  archmage's ears.
[1286.96s -> 1287.60s]  Walk on.
[1287.60s -> 1292.74s]  You walk on, head held high, up the steps.
[1292.74s -> 1297.76s]  The wind picks up as the evening draws on.
[1297.76s -> 1299.26s]  It will be night soon.
[1299.26s -> 1302.62s]  The Zanzunu peaks rise on either side like jagged teeth.
[1303.18s -> 1308.46s]  The path winds back and forth as it climbs, and glimpses of the brooding horror of Mampang
[1308.46s -> 1310.03s]  come and go.
[1310.03s -> 1314.32s]  You should make progress while there is still plenty of light.
[1314.32s -> 1316.02s]  Sing as I climb.
[1316.02s -> 1319.39s]  You try to sing as you climb.
[1319.39s -> 1324.51s]  An old Anolan song that tells of a wandering wizard and his three small children.
[1324.51s -> 1327.25s]  But even you cannot be jolly in this dread place.
[1327.25s -> 1329.60s]  The song dies in your throat.
[1329.60s -> 1334.14s]  Okay.
[1334.14s -> 1335.10s]  Rough undergrowth.
[1337.18s -> 1340.14s]  Rough undergrowth springs up, lining the path on either side.
[1343.87s -> 1345.07s]  Should we just look in it?
[1345.07s -> 1350.16s]  Perhaps one of the acolytes who climbed this way years ago dropped something of use.
[1350.16s -> 1354.96s]  You pause and push back the undergrowth with the blade of your sword, and then jump as
[1354.96s -> 1357.52s]  you disturb a nesting spike hawk.
[1357.52s -> 1360.27s]  The creature flaps in alarm.
[1360.27s -> 1364.91s]  Kill it, stay back, or walk away.
[1364.91s -> 1365.87s]  My acolytes!
[1365.87s -> 1370.00s]  My acolytes!
[1370.00s -> 1371.39s]  Stay back?
[1371.39s -> 1373.31s]  All right, I'm going to stay back.
[1373.31s -> 1377.79s]  You stay well clear, and the hawk screams and flaps its wide wings, but does not chase
[1377.79s -> 1378.19s]  you.
[1378.19s -> 1381.44s]  It sounds something like this.
[1381.44s -> 1386.32s]  I can't do that voice anymore.
[1386.32s -> 1387.04s]  I'm fucking 40.
[1387.04s -> 1387.52s]  Never mind.
[1395.74s -> 1397.42s]  Uh, should I talk?
[1397.42s -> 1400.51s]  Maybe I can talk to him.
[1400.51s -> 1401.47s]  Talk with animals?
[1401.47s -> 1402.27s]  Let's just, why not?
[1408.45s -> 1411.81s]  Grabbing the wig from your pack, you pull it onto your head and weave your spell.
[1411.81s -> 1414.77s]  Faint chitterings from the bush resolve into words.
[1415.82s -> 1416.30s]  Worms!
[1417.66s -> 1418.06s]  Worms!
[1418.78s -> 1419.18s]  Dark!
[1419.74s -> 1420.14s]  Dark!
[1422.75s -> 1427.04s]  Uh, speak a greeting?
[1427.04s -> 1428.50s]  Greetings!
[1428.50s -> 1430.43s]  I am a traveler.
[1430.43s -> 1434.59s]  A moment later the bushes part, and a mother spike hawk rises from the undergrowth.
[1435.71s -> 1436.35s]  Intruder!
[1437.15s -> 1437.55s]  Attack!
[1438.19s -> 1438.59s]  Beast!
[1440.11s -> 1440.67s]  Eyes!
[1440.67s -> 1441.39s]  Get the eyes!
[1443.92s -> 1447.94s]  I mean you no harm.
[1447.94s -> 1450.74s]  I mean you no harm, you reply quickly.
[1450.74s -> 1455.46s]  The wig translating your intention into clicks of your tongue and curious squawks.
[1455.46s -> 1456.34s]  Harm?
[1456.34s -> 1457.14s]  Harm!
[1457.14s -> 1459.30s]  The bird screeches back, rising higher.
[1459.30s -> 1462.03s]  Oh shit.
[1462.03s -> 1462.59s]  Back off.
[1463.52s -> 1465.04s]  I come in peace.
[1465.04s -> 1466.64s]  What am I, a fucking alien?
[1466.64s -> 1470.19s]  Did I just, did I just get out of a spaceship?
[1472.85s -> 1473.97s]  I come in peace.
[1477.02s -> 1477.42s]  Peace!
[1479.34s -> 1482.34s]  Settling somewhat, the bird.
[1482.34s -> 1485.44s]  What can you tell me of Mampang?
[1485.44s -> 1485.92s]  You ask.
[1487.74s -> 1488.30s]  Mampang!
[1489.26s -> 1490.30s]  Evil magic!
[1490.30s -> 1490.70s]  Evil!
[1491.34s -> 1492.46s]  Evil magic!
[1492.46s -> 1493.82s]  That's not even a bird.
[1493.82s -> 1497.82s]  That's just somebody that has the hiccups really bad today.
[1497.82s -> 1502.08s]  But I'm gonna stay with it.
[1502.08s -> 1502.72s]  Mampang!
[1504.40s -> 1505.20s]  Evil magic!
[1505.20s -> 1506.00s]  Evil!
[1506.00s -> 1506.88s]  Finally the spell fades.
[1506.88s -> 1508.64s]  The bird settles back into the bushes.
[1508.64s -> 1511.22s]  You resume the climb up the endless stairs.
[1511.22s -> 1514.75s]  Hey, well we avoided a fight.
[1514.75s -> 1515.79s]  That's always a good thing.
[1520.00s -> 1521.04s]  That was a donkey.
[1525.10s -> 1527.82s]  Yeah, that was one step away from like...
[1527.98s -> 1531.50s]  Yeah, it's okay.
[1531.50s -> 1533.81s]  The sun is now sinking down.
[1533.81s -> 1534.69s]  Soon it will be dark.
[1534.69s -> 1535.98s]  You reach the top of the stairs.
[1535.98s -> 1540.05s]  Rounding the corner, you find three cave mouths set into the rock.
[1540.05s -> 1542.21s]  Three cave mouths.
[1542.21s -> 1543.81s]  Take a look.
[1543.81s -> 1547.90s]  You regard the caves with interest.
[1547.90s -> 1552.78s]  Middle cave has the smallest entrance and probably opens into a niche and nothing more.
[1552.78s -> 1555.34s]  The nearest cave would be large enough for a fire,
[1555.34s -> 1558.38s]  but looks deep enough to contain any number of nasty surprises.
[1558.38s -> 1563.17s]  A series of hoof prints lead into the mouth of the furthest cave.
[1563.17s -> 1570.06s]  Okay, so the furthest cave, something obviously went in there.
[1570.06s -> 1576.29s]  The middle cave is small, really small.
[1576.29s -> 1580.37s]  And the closest one is big enough to go in there and sit down,
[1580.37s -> 1583.90s]  but somebody might be in there.
[1583.90s -> 1585.74s]  Uh, look at the hoof prints.
[1585.74s -> 1588.30s]  You take a closer look at the hoof prints.
[1588.30s -> 1591.26s]  They are deep enough to suggest a largest creature,
[1591.26s -> 1593.74s]  but they are no longer fresh.
[1593.74s -> 1596.29s]  They're at least a few days old.
[1596.29s -> 1599.01s]  You also know that there are no prints coming out of the cave.
[1599.01s -> 1600.58s]  Okay, so something's in there.
[1600.58s -> 1605.73s]  What can I do?
[1605.73s -> 1616.50s]  Should I just throw just, just fucking bowling ball of fireball into one of them?
[1617.06s -> 1619.52s]  Should I just throw a fireball?
[1621.36s -> 1622.56s]  That would be very rude.
[1624.45s -> 1625.41s]  Cause stupidity?
[1628.56s -> 1629.84s]  Hop? I could just throw a grenade.
[1630.74s -> 1632.26s]  Why would I throw, just roll a grenade?
[1632.26s -> 1633.06s]  BLT!
[1634.50s -> 1639.20s]  You craft a BLT out of thin air.
[1639.20s -> 1640.88s]  Delicious mayo.
[1640.88s -> 1642.05s]  Crisp lettuce.
[1642.61s -> 1643.41s]  Crunchy bacon.
[1644.21s -> 1645.33s]  Juicy tomato slice.
[1645.89s -> 1651.33s]  You then squish it up into a ball and roll it into the furthest cave.
[1655.42s -> 1659.09s]  Okay, um, I don't know.
[1661.22s -> 1662.34s]  Open locks and doors.
[1662.34s -> 1669.18s]  That's, I wonder.
[1669.18s -> 1671.74s]  There's no gob, so we can't do goblin.
[1672.54s -> 1674.94s]  It's really just throw a grenade or not.
[1675.82s -> 1678.61s]  Heal disease.
[1679.33s -> 1683.17s]  Maybe there's somebody in there that's sick or something.
[1683.17s -> 1689.06s]  I could, ooh, I got it.
[1689.06s -> 1690.02s]  How about how?
[1690.02s -> 1690.90s]  Find safe passage.
[1690.90s -> 1691.78s]  Let's do it.
[1691.78s -> 1697.39s]  You cast a spell and a familiar calm voice begins to speak to you.
[1699.22s -> 1701.06s]  Every cave has its dangers.
[1701.70s -> 1704.03s]  This voice informs you.
[1704.91s -> 1708.30s]  The smallest cave requires courage.
[1708.30s -> 1710.46s]  The largest, brawn.
[1710.46s -> 1715.54s]  But what the third cave requires you are never going to find out.
[1715.54s -> 1717.55s]  Goodbye.
[1719.38s -> 1720.10s]  What?
[1720.10s -> 1723.79s]  The smallest cave requires courage.
[1723.79s -> 1725.63s]  The largest, brawn.
[1725.63s -> 1728.35s]  Aren't these kind of the same thing?
[1735.62s -> 1738.50s]  What the, how do I know what one, two, and three is?
[1738.50s -> 1744.16s]  I'm gonna call out.
[1744.16s -> 1745.12s]  Who's there?
[1745.12s -> 1748.56s]  You call, hoping the owner of the hoofprints will appear, but there's no response.
[1748.56s -> 1752.00s]  The caves are unlikely to contain anything but nasty surprises, surely.
[1755.26s -> 1758.70s]  Okay, so this is, what did Bugleberry say?
[1759.26s -> 1760.50s]  Let me see.
[1763.62s -> 1766.74s]  Okay, small, shallow is courage.
[1766.74s -> 1769.70s]  Large is, large is fight something, right, obviously.
[1769.70s -> 1772.58s]  The third cave requires you never find out.
[1772.58s -> 1776.22s]  So it's saying don't go in here.
[1776.22s -> 1777.26s]  It's, I might just die.
[1777.82s -> 1780.72s]  But that's sort of intriguing, isn't it?
[1780.72s -> 1788.70s]  I'm going in here.
[1789.60s -> 1790.00s]  Shallow.
[1790.56s -> 1793.92s]  Right in the middle.
[1793.92s -> 1799.94s]  You approach the smallest cave mouth and kneel down to peer inside.
[1799.94s -> 1803.38s]  You might be able to crawl inside, but it would be a tight squeeze.
[1803.38s -> 1808.38s]  I don't know if I want to, that would scare the shit out of anybody that was in here.
[1813.46s -> 1816.11s]  Okay.
[1818.85s -> 1820.77s]  Protect from magic, that might not be a bad idea.
[1821.57s -> 1824.02s]  Put the wig on and just start talking.
[1836.62s -> 1837.26s]  Do big?
[1838.80s -> 1840.80s]  I don't think I can, I would just die.
[1841.84s -> 1843.62s]  I don't think big is even an option.
[1846.88s -> 1847.76s]  Summon replica.
[1850.11s -> 1852.51s]  Uh, there's, summon darkness.
[1852.51s -> 1853.39s]  I wouldn't want to do that.
[1854.83s -> 1856.27s]  Forcefield's not a bad idea either.
[1859.31s -> 1860.75s]  See the future.
[1860.75s -> 1861.87s]  I'm gonna do it.
[1861.95s -> 1867.71s]  You settle into a sitting position on the ground and take out the orb of crystal.
[1867.71s -> 1870.91s]  Looking to the stars, you craft the magic and suddenly you find yourself somewhere quite new.
[1871.55s -> 1875.94s]  You stand on a bridge slung across a deep chasm.
[1875.94s -> 1880.27s]  As you step on the planks of the wood, the bridge begins to whisper in your mind.
[1880.27s -> 1886.34s]  Cruel and humiliating thoughts assail you.
[1886.34s -> 1893.74s]  Uh, step forward.
[1893.74s -> 1896.22s]  You take another step forward, but all your hope is gone.
[1896.86s -> 1898.70s]  Your body feels like lead.
[1898.70s -> 1902.38s]  But then you find you are reaching into your pack and taking something out.
[1902.38s -> 1905.30s]  Slipping something onto your feet.
[1905.30s -> 1906.18s]  Look down.
[1906.18s -> 1909.25s]  You look down, hoping to see what you are wearing,
[1909.25s -> 1913.57s]  but catch sight of the dizzying drop below you and your head begins to swim.
[1913.57s -> 1915.38s]  The vision fades.
[1915.38s -> 1920.54s]  As your eyes adjust to the darkness within, you can see that beyond the entrance,
[1920.54s -> 1922.70s]  the space opens up somewhat.
[1922.70s -> 1925.30s]  Opens out somewhat.
[1925.30s -> 1926.02s]  Looney Tunes?
[1926.02s -> 1928.02s]  Yeah, that was kind of like a Wile E. Coyote bit.
[1928.02s -> 1931.12s]  I'm just gonna scream in here.
[1931.12s -> 1936.38s]  You call a wordless greeting into the cave mouth, listening for the echo.
[1936.38s -> 1939.47s]  Ready to react should you disturb any creatures.
[1939.47s -> 1941.41s]  Nothing stirs.
[1941.41s -> 1944.69s]  Then a shrill howling issues from the cave.
[1948.10s -> 1949.38s]  Like, what am I even doing?
[1949.38s -> 1952.66s]  Do it again.
[1952.66s -> 1956.77s]  You call inside again a wordless cry of threat.
[1956.77s -> 1962.30s]  Then wait, expecting something to rush you any moment, but still nothing emerges.
[1962.30s -> 1965.95s]  Toss a stone into the cave?
[1965.95s -> 1969.58s]  Am I gonna get rid of an item here?
[1969.58s -> 1978.46s]  Hold on.
[1978.46s -> 1979.74s]  Yeah, that would be a pebble, right?
[1979.74s -> 1980.78s]  I don't think I'm gonna throw this.
[1985.49s -> 1987.49s]  Just live in this cave forever.
[1987.49s -> 1993.92s]  Hopefully that doesn't remove anything.
[1993.92s -> 1994.80s]  I'll try it.
[1994.80s -> 1996.66s]  Throw a stone in the cave.
[1997.46s -> 2000.26s]  You find a stone nearby and toss it into the cave.
[2000.26s -> 2002.21s]  Nothing happens at first.
[2002.21s -> 2005.25s]  A howl issues from the cave once more.
[2005.25s -> 2009.25s]  I'm gonna walk through here and just instantly die.
[2009.25s -> 2011.92s]  Crawl inside.
[2011.92s -> 2016.13s]  Stealing your courage, you crawl into the mouth of the cave.
[2016.13s -> 2017.73s]  Inside the cave.
[2017.73s -> 2022.42s]  You're barely through the entrance of the cave when the howling noise sounds again.
[2022.42s -> 2025.62s]  It is now somewhat, somewhere terribly close at hand.
[2025.62s -> 2032.21s]  Just start stabbing out in the darkness?
[2032.21s -> 2034.45s]  Have a, um, let's get out.
[2034.45s -> 2037.60s]  Strike a light?
[2037.60s -> 2046.14s]  You could use the tinderbox to make a spark.
[2046.14s -> 2047.82s]  Burn the marsh goblin scroll.
[2047.82s -> 2049.10s]  Burn my spell book.
[2049.10s -> 2051.17s]  It's always the spell book.
[2051.17s -> 2052.45s]  No, don't burn anything.
[2052.45s -> 2054.91s]  I'm gonna wait.
[2054.91s -> 2061.25s]  Fucking zoombini.
[2061.25s -> 2063.97s]  You wait a moment and slowly your eyes adjust to the dark,
[2063.97s -> 2066.37s]  but you can still see nothing in the chamber.
[2066.37s -> 2068.61s]  Then a tiny creature brushes your leg.
[2073.97s -> 2082.37s]  Anybody get that one?
[2082.37s -> 2085.87s]  That was very specific.
[2085.87s -> 2087.79s]  The thing is a jibjib.
[2087.79s -> 2090.35s]  No more dangerous than an overgrown mouse.
[2090.35s -> 2093.44s]  I've retin the creature.
[2093.44s -> 2095.90s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[2095.90s -> 2097.92s]  Look at it.
[2097.92s -> 2101.12s]  Covered in fur and no larger than a bomba fruit.
[2101.12s -> 2104.16s]  Stands on two duck-like feet.
[2104.16s -> 2107.36s]  Its body must be mostly lungs as despite its size,
[2107.36s -> 2109.68s]  when it howls, it makes a noise like a horn.
[2109.68s -> 2126.14s]  I feel like it's kind of mean to just be mean to the little creature.
[2126.14s -> 2129.41s]  No, I'm gonna leave the creature alone.
[2129.41s -> 2130.21s]  You leave the creature.
[2130.21s -> 2133.89s]  It howls a few more times, but is beginning to realize you are not afraid.
[2133.89s -> 2139.86s]  A moment later, it scurries away out of the cave.
[2139.86s -> 2141.57s]  Okay.
[2141.57s -> 2143.09s]  The cave appears otherwise empty.
[2143.09s -> 2147.09s]  This would be a dry, well-protected place to rest if it was nighttime,
[2147.09s -> 2148.82s]  but it is too early to sleep.
[2148.82s -> 2149.46s]  What time is it?
[2152.34s -> 2153.38s]  I'm not gonna eat.
[2153.38s -> 2155.84s]  I'll leave the cave.
[2155.84s -> 2158.32s]  There was just a little zoombini guy in there.
[2158.32s -> 2159.86s]  That's it.
[2159.86s -> 2163.46s]  I guess I could have threatened it.
[2163.46s -> 2168.74s]  Okay.
[2168.74s -> 2171.14s]  The sun is almost set and the sky is a deep pink.
[2171.14s -> 2173.06s]  The path continues on past the other caves.
[2173.06s -> 2175.14s]  Do I want to do any of the other caves?
[2175.14s -> 2180.21s]  I feel like I'm afraid to do it.
[2180.21s -> 2183.04s]  That one was no danger.
[2184.93s -> 2189.65s]  This one said I'm to be scared of this.
[2189.65s -> 2190.13s]  Why not?
[2190.13s -> 2191.41s]  I can always rewind it.
[2191.49s -> 2193.33s]  I have three rewinds.
[2193.33s -> 2195.44s]  Stepping towards the northernmost cave,
[2195.44s -> 2198.72s]  you see a few more sets of older hoof marks near to the mouth.
[2198.72s -> 2201.46s]  Let's see if we can appear in.
[2201.46s -> 2203.86s]  The cave appears to be deep, but quite empty.
[2203.86s -> 2206.58s]  Whatever creature made the hoof prints, it is either left another way
[2207.14s -> 2209.14s]  or is hiding in the furthest shadows.
[2212.70s -> 2214.70s]  You draw your sword in preparation,
[2214.70s -> 2217.34s]  feeling more secure with the metal in your hand.
[2217.34s -> 2218.14s]  Enter.
[2218.14s -> 2221.33s]  You step inside the mouth of the cave.
[2222.05s -> 2223.65s]  Outside, night has fallen.
[2223.65s -> 2225.14s]  But in a moment, you stop.
[2225.70s -> 2227.86s]  We're sitting on a rock just inside the mouth of the cave.
[2228.34s -> 2228.98s]  It's a figure.
[2241.10s -> 2246.42s]  Oh, you can really be a dick in this game.
[2246.42s -> 2248.02s]  You can you can truly be.
[2249.30s -> 2251.14s]  I'm just I'm just a maniac in this game.
[2251.14s -> 2253.94s]  You just I'm just gonna attack this person, but I'm not gonna.
[2253.94s -> 2262.59s]  The figure is in shadow, but it is human like and naked.
[2263.23s -> 2267.49s]  A long mane of hair sweeps down over its back, which is turned towards you.
[2267.49s -> 2273.09s]  Clearly, you are treading quietly as the figure has not turned around.
[2273.09s -> 2276.88s]  Honestly, I'm not even sure this is a good idea.
[2276.88s -> 2281.84s]  Imagine just being I feel like somebody being like, hey, what's up, dude?
[2282.96s -> 2284.24s]  Somebody's in the fucking cave with me.
[2284.24s -> 2288.37s]  Like I would I would freak the fuck out.
[2288.37s -> 2289.25s]  Uh, what can I do?
[2295.49s -> 2300.93s]  Oh, this is why you try to get all the items and it can be kind of a pain.
[2300.93s -> 2303.25s]  But I can I can read this creature's mind.
[2309.36s -> 2310.48s]  That's even worse.
[2311.04s -> 2316.43s]  Not only am I saying hello, I'm saying hello telepathically.
[2319.54s -> 2320.66s]  That would be awful.
[2321.38s -> 2326.98s]  Okay, you bind the starlight into shape around you, pulling on the cloth as you do so.
[2326.98s -> 2330.74s]  Why not greet the creature telepathically?
[2333.71s -> 2334.19s]  Greetings.
[2334.83s -> 2338.69s]  You think, but there's no response as though you're not being heard.
[2340.86s -> 2341.42s]  Can I listen?
[2342.74s -> 2345.70s]  You focus and try to read the creature's thoughts.
[2345.70s -> 2348.74s]  But despite reaching out with your mind, you sense nothing.
[2348.74s -> 2354.66s]  Either it is shielded against magic or it is entirely without thoughts.
[2356.29s -> 2357.49s]  You remove the skull cap.
[2360.42s -> 2364.90s]  You sense that this creature cannot rotate a cube in their mind.
[2364.90s -> 2366.45s]  What do you do now?
[2376.11s -> 2377.31s]  Um, whatever.
[2378.69s -> 2379.65s]  Who is there?
[2379.65s -> 2380.29s]  You call out.
[2380.29s -> 2382.21s]  The figure makes no reaction.
[2384.58s -> 2385.14s]  Call again.
[2385.70s -> 2387.38s]  Will you not greet me?
[2387.38s -> 2388.56s]  Still nothing.
[2388.56s -> 2389.76s]  Perhaps the creature is deaf.
[2391.55s -> 2392.75s]  These are all bad.
[2392.75s -> 2394.35s]  These are all fucking bad.
[2394.35s -> 2394.85s]  I don't.
[2395.31s -> 2396.86s]  All right.
[2396.86s -> 2398.94s]  You reach out to touch the creature's shoulder.
[2400.45s -> 2404.13s]  The figure shudders a moment, then slides from its rock to the floor.
[2405.76s -> 2407.68s]  Oh, I think this creature is dead.
[2407.68s -> 2411.76s]  You look over the creature.
[2411.76s -> 2416.72s]  It is a woman with a human torso, but her legs are thick with hair and end in hooves.
[2416.72s -> 2422.16s]  Her face is a blend of human and goat-like features, and two short horns rise from her
[2422.16s -> 2423.12s]  forehead.
[2423.12s -> 2429.76s]  She is quite clearly dead.
[2429.76s -> 2430.40s]  Bury?
[2430.40s -> 2431.28s]  Bury the body?
[2432.37s -> 2432.87s]  Search?
[2433.33s -> 2433.83s]  Leave?
[2440.40s -> 2440.80s]  Can I?
[2440.80s -> 2441.30s]  Okay, can I?
[2442.32s -> 2443.46s]  I'm going to bury.
[2444.42s -> 2444.92s]  Search?
[2445.38s -> 2446.88s]  Do you have?
[2446.88s -> 2447.28s]  Does it?
[2447.28s -> 2448.24s]  Did she have a pack?
[2451.25s -> 2452.53s]  Oh, okay.
[2452.53s -> 2453.49s]  She's carrying nothing.
[2453.73s -> 2454.85s]  Her skin is quite cold.
[2454.85s -> 2455.57s]  All right, we're going to bury.
[2455.57s -> 2456.37s]  We're going to bury the body.
[2459.09s -> 2464.29s]  It is hard work digging in the dirt of the cave floor with your assassin's sword, but
[2464.29s -> 2469.34s]  after an hour or so, you've made a pit deep enough to roll the body into.
[2469.34s -> 2473.82s]  You lay it down as gently as you can, and then move the dirt back over it once more.
[2473.82s -> 2476.53s]  The dust clears, and you are left quite alone.
[2478.88s -> 2479.52s]  Digging with a...
[2479.52s -> 2481.36s]  Yeah, how the fuck would you dig with a sword?
[2482.08s -> 2482.80s]  Use your hands.
[2482.80s -> 2484.08s]  That'd be way more effective.
[2486.86s -> 2489.25s]  Um, I should...
[2489.25s -> 2489.97s]  I'm going to sleep here.
[2490.37s -> 2492.96s]  You should be safe here.
[2492.96s -> 2495.44s]  Laying your pack down, you try to settle despite the hard floor.
[2495.44s -> 2496.96s]  You've not eaten yet today.
[2498.54s -> 2501.17s]  Uh, I'll eat something.
[2501.81s -> 2504.13s]  You eat an apple and feel much better for it.
[2504.13s -> 2506.61s]  Then you close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.
[2508.32s -> 2508.82s]  Dream.
[2509.98s -> 2511.98s]  What is left of the night is filled with visions.
[2512.88s -> 2516.38s]  Jibjibs are bouncing past you, appearing from all sides.
[2516.38s -> 2518.86s]  Their maniac eyes are all but popping from their heads.
[2519.50s -> 2524.94s]  You are standing on top of a tall, black-tiled tower, clinging onto its tiles with one hand.
[2525.68s -> 2528.64s]  With the other, you wave something in the air.
[2528.64s -> 2531.94s]  What is it?
[2533.82s -> 2536.78s]  You look in your hand to find you are holding nothing less than the crown itself.
[2537.82s -> 2541.82s]  Then, you hear a cawing sound, and a great shape moves towards you.
[2541.82s -> 2543.17s]  A birdman?
[2544.05s -> 2547.70s]  No, a gold-crested eagle, shimmering into view.
[2547.70s -> 2549.06s]  The Sightmasters have seen you.
[2549.06s -> 2556.54s]  They are taking you home!
[2556.54s -> 2560.70s]  You ate one provision, explored the caves of Pyzamen, and began your ascent into the mountains.
[2561.26s -> 2563.58s]  The Archmage remains unaware of you.
[2563.58s -> 2565.71s]  That's really...
[2565.71s -> 2566.91s]  That's actually a huge deal.
[2567.63s -> 2574.78s]  You wake to the sunlight spilling through the cave mouth.
[2574.78s -> 2576.70s]  I just ate, so I don't need to eat again.
[2576.70s -> 2584.70s]  You head outside once more, leaving the solemn earth mound behind.
[2584.70s -> 2585.90s]  Sun breaks over the horizon.
[2585.90s -> 2586.70s]  I guess I could...
[2586.70s -> 2587.74s]  This one, I don't want to fight.
[2587.74s -> 2588.54s]  Whatever it is in there.
[2588.54s -> 2589.34s]  So I'm just going to keep going.
[2592.40s -> 2593.44s]  You leave the caves behind.
[2593.44s -> 2600.24s]  The steps are becoming wider as the path turns to follow the edge of a deep chasm.
[2600.24s -> 2602.42s]  Walk on.
[2602.42s -> 2607.52s]  A little further on, a rock ledge juts out into the chasm to post-stand on either side.
[2607.52s -> 2611.12s]  The narrow and rather ancient wooden bridge lashed to them.
[2611.12s -> 2612.67s]  Okay.
[2612.67s -> 2616.93s]  I think this is the bridge in the future thing.
[2616.93s -> 2620.98s]  What's the goal of part four?
[2620.98s -> 2625.84s]  The goal of part four is to go find the Archmage and go get the crown.
[2625.84s -> 2629.60s]  All right, look at the bridge.
[2629.60s -> 2632.11s]  The bridge must be a hundred years old at least.
[2632.11s -> 2636.75s]  It is set into timber supports driven deep into fixtures out of sight below the ledge.
[2636.75s -> 2640.32s]  Seems like it might still be solid.
[2640.32s -> 2641.68s]  Uh, okay.
[2641.68s -> 2648.13s]  I have to be careful because I think I'm going to fall.
[2648.13s -> 2653.26s]  You glance down at the path ahead and see a line of hoof prints similar to those you saw outside the cave.
[2653.26s -> 2655.02s]  They lead a way past the bridge.
[2658.77s -> 2661.70s]  Okay.
[2661.70s -> 2665.54s]  You lift your eyes to look across the chasm to the other side where more mountains rise up.
[2665.54s -> 2669.04s]  A cleft line in their peaks traces a narrow road,
[2669.04s -> 2672.16s]  and atop one summit is what looks like a large bird's nest.
[2672.16s -> 2674.78s]  Cross the bridge and move on.
[2674.78s -> 2675.34s]  I don't want to throw it.
[2675.34s -> 2676.46s]  I want to keep my money.
[2676.46s -> 2678.80s]  Okay, time to continue.
[2678.80s -> 2683.14s]  If the bridge is sound, it would get you quickly closer to the citadel.
[2683.14s -> 2684.98s]  And if somebody said, can you zoom out?
[2684.98s -> 2686.69s]  Yes, I can.
[2687.87s -> 2690.66s]  Here is Bampang.
[2690.66s -> 2698.21s]  Got a little ways to go before we get there though.
[2698.21s -> 2698.61s]  All right.
[2698.61s -> 2701.49s]  Uh, this looks kind of interesting.
[2702.13s -> 2704.64s]  The bridge, I don't know if it's safe.
[2704.64s -> 2705.20s]  It might be.
[2706.74s -> 2708.90s]  But I kind of want to go this way.
[2713.78s -> 2717.98s]  This is much longer, but I feel like kind of interesting.
[2717.98s -> 2723.12s]  All right, let's go to the winding path.
[2726.02s -> 2727.06s]  You guys just got Elden Ringed.
[2727.06s -> 2727.86s]  That's right.
[2727.86s -> 2731.44s]  When you make your way along the track, then pause for breath.
[2731.44s -> 2734.56s]  The air stirs a little, still cold, but fresh at least.
[2734.56s -> 2737.54s]  A jutting rock sticks out just by the edge of the ravine.
[2738.10s -> 2741.70s]  Look at the rock.
[2741.70s -> 2746.58s]  The rock is like a hooked claw poking out of the edge of the chasm and looking out over the drop.
[2746.66s -> 2750.64s]  The far face is grown over with thick, fleshy green moss.
[2750.64s -> 2751.92s]  Ooh, green moss.
[2752.56s -> 2753.60s]  Why did I say it like that?
[2754.72s -> 2756.72s]  Ooh, actually green moss.
[2756.72s -> 2758.91s]  You grab a handful of the moss.
[2758.91s -> 2760.93s]  It feels juicy and fresh.
[2760.93s -> 2761.97s]  I'm going to take it.
[2761.97s -> 2763.33s]  No, not taste it.
[2763.33s -> 2767.71s]  Oh, I guess I can just eat it.
[2767.71s -> 2769.97s]  Eat it.
[2769.97s -> 2770.77s]  Healing warmth.
[2770.77s -> 2773.12s]  Yeah, we got full health though.
[2773.12s -> 2775.94s]  Look into the ravine.
[2775.94s -> 2779.54s]  The ravine on the north side of the path is deep, but not impossibly so.
[2779.54s -> 2784.62s]  A sheer drop becomes softer as the ground curves towards grassland within view.
[2784.62s -> 2786.90s]  Let me take a look.
[2787.06s -> 2787.86s]  I could do this.
[2789.63s -> 2796.00s]  I technically could drop the rope down, go this way, and come up here.
[2796.56s -> 2799.14s]  I think that's what that's implying.
[2799.70s -> 2800.82s]  Investigate whatever this is.
[2802.19s -> 2805.62s]  Or just keep going the long way down this path.
[2805.62s -> 2810.85s]  I think I want to go the long way.
[2810.85s -> 2815.09s]  Look, this is part four.
[2815.09s -> 2816.13s]  This is the final part.
[2816.85s -> 2818.88s]  So let's not skip it.
[2818.88s -> 2820.64s]  Let's take our time with it.
[2820.64s -> 2821.92s]  Let's go the long way.
[2828.16s -> 2829.04s]  Yeah, that's riskier.
[2829.04s -> 2830.16s]  I'll probably take damage doing that.
[2835.86s -> 2837.14s]  Okay, up the path.
[2837.14s -> 2842.86s]  The path crosses a rocky plateau which rises gradually.
[2843.58s -> 2845.18s]  Few clouds move across the heavens.
[2845.74s -> 2850.38s]  You're almost in the peaks now, with sheer drops opening on either side.
[2850.38s -> 2854.06s]  The plateau is relatively sheltered, but there's no time to waste here.
[2856.02s -> 2858.00s]  Ooh, okay, let's keep going.
[2858.00s -> 2865.74s]  A sheer rock wall stretches high on your right, while a drop is to your left.
[2866.30s -> 2868.54s]  Follow the path as it curves around.
[2868.54s -> 2870.70s]  As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.
[2870.70s -> 2874.99s]  The path quickly narrows, and you have to press yourself against the wall at times.
[2875.65s -> 2880.93s]  You follow the trail around a corner, stopping short in view of a jutting ledge.
[2880.93s -> 2884.70s]  The path turns to fresh mud, pressed with hoof prints.
[2891.79s -> 2892.59s]  Take a look.
[2892.59s -> 2898.00s]  The prints are similar to the ones you saw before outside the cave.
[2898.00s -> 2900.48s]  Could they be more of the goat people here?
[2900.48s -> 2904.46s]  You continue upwards, sweating under your pack, head low.
[2904.46s -> 2911.15s]  But as you wind around a bend, a voice like gravel calls out,
[2911.15s -> 2912.11s]  Halt!
[2912.11s -> 2921.62s]  You stop, in your tracks, and a rock strikes you on the temple.
[2921.62s -> 2922.62s]  What?
[2922.62s -> 2927.10s]  Looking sharply up, you see two creatures, each half human and half goat.
[2927.10s -> 2930.46s]  Perched against the southern slope, spears held ready.
[2930.46s -> 2935.97s]  What is your business?
[2935.97s -> 2936.93s]  One demands.
[2936.93s -> 2941.84s]  Okay, so here are the goat people.
[2941.84s -> 2943.76s]  Who are you?
[2943.76s -> 2945.12s]  I mean you no harm.
[2945.12s -> 2947.90s]  I discovered one of your companions.
[2947.90s -> 2949.58s]  Hey, I think this is it.
[2949.58s -> 2953.12s]  I discovered one- should I say that immediately,
[2953.12s -> 2955.33s]  or are they gonna throw another rock at my head?
[2955.33s -> 2961.25s]  I discovered one of your companions.
[2961.25s -> 2964.18s]  One lowers her spear.
[2964.18s -> 2966.03s]  Where?
[2966.03s -> 2966.99s]  In a cave.
[2966.99s -> 2970.08s]  She is dead.
[2970.08s -> 2977.15s]  Uh, shit.
[2977.15s -> 2979.36s]  In a cave.
[2979.36s -> 2980.00s]  How was she?
[2980.64s -> 2981.28s]  She demands.
[2981.28s -> 2982.32s]  Her concern is clear.
[2984.21s -> 2985.86s]  Dead.
[2985.86s -> 2987.38s]  That's not a nice way to say that.
[2989.04s -> 2990.38s]  How was she?
[2990.38s -> 2995.89s]  Dead.
[2995.89s -> 3000.05s]  I have to say this though, because if I lie and they go find out that she's dead,
[3000.05s -> 3001.65s]  they're gonna think I did it.
[3001.65s -> 3003.62s]  Dead.
[3003.62s -> 3005.79s]  Dead.
[3005.79s -> 3007.82s]  As expected.
[3007.82s -> 3009.34s]  You must have discovered.
[3009.34s -> 3011.20s]  She himbly.
[3011.20s -> 3013.84s]  She disappeared a few nights ago.
[3013.84s -> 3018.40s]  She was very ill, and I suspect she left to prevent her disease from spreading to others.
[3018.40s -> 3019.12s]  Oh, fuck.
[3023.25s -> 3029.18s]  It is hard to hear of her fate, but I am glad you told us of her sacrifice.
[3029.18s -> 3030.94s]  Forgive my curiosity.
[3030.94s -> 3033.34s]  The second goat woman says.
[3033.34s -> 3035.18s]  But where are you traveling from?
[3035.18s -> 3045.38s]  Just walk away.
[3045.38s -> 3048.62s]  Uh, tell them something.
[3048.62s -> 3051.23s]  You take a moment to prepare a reply.
[3051.23s -> 3055.68s]  Are these creatures servants of the Archmage, or are they his enemies?
[3055.68s -> 3060.03s]  I come from Anorland, and I journey to Mampang.
[3060.03s -> 3062.59s]  From Kare, off to sell goods in Mampang.
[3062.59s -> 3065.57s]  From the southern plains, with no destination in mind.
[3065.57s -> 3071.49s]  Let's just go.
[3071.49s -> 3072.77s]  Let's just tell the truth.
[3074.72s -> 3077.76s]  I come from Anorland, and I journey to Mampang.
[3078.32s -> 3084.69s]  You declare, unafraid, who should hear your words.
[3084.69s -> 3085.41s]  Mampang!
[3086.21s -> 3087.65s]  Ah, the curse in place.
[3088.51s -> 3090.11s]  And what is your purpose?
[3090.11s -> 3094.10s]  I will recover the crown of kings.
[3094.10s -> 3096.61s]  To find a lost heirloom.
[3096.61s -> 3103.31s]  I will not say.
[3103.31s -> 3108.11s]  Uh, to find a lost heirloom.
[3108.11s -> 3109.71s]  Do not mock us, stranger.
[3110.67s -> 3114.69s]  We are an isolated people, but even we know respect.
[3114.69s -> 3116.45s]  Unlike yourself, it seems.
[3116.45s -> 3120.93s]  Do not test me.
[3120.93s -> 3123.50s]  I'm not used to strangers.
[3123.50s -> 3128.32s]  I mean no offense.
[3128.32s -> 3131.46s]  Do not test me.
[3131.46s -> 3138.98s]  I am sorry, I'm not used to talking to strangers.
[3138.98s -> 3140.02s]  As we are not.
[3140.58s -> 3142.66s]  I suppose there was no harm done?
[3142.66s -> 3143.94s]  The creature nods.
[3143.94s -> 3147.23s]  Please, come with us.
[3147.23s -> 3150.67s]  Shihori will wish to hear what you have to say.
[3150.67s -> 3153.79s]  The hoofborns turn and begin to climb up a side path.
[3153.79s -> 3155.71s]  It's what we're doing right now.
[3155.71s -> 3158.75s]  We will take you to our village, if you are willing.
[3158.75s -> 3165.95s]  Who is Shihori?
[3168.05s -> 3169.09s]  Our leader.
[3169.09s -> 3170.13s]  The best of us.
[3170.13s -> 3171.41s]  The first.
[3171.41s -> 3171.97s]  You will come?
[3174.02s -> 3175.38s]  I cannot come with you.
[3175.38s -> 3176.10s]  I cannot climb.
[3176.10s -> 3176.90s]  I cannot.
[3176.90s -> 3177.78s]  It's true.
[3177.78s -> 3179.30s]  My back hurts, and my legs hurt.
[3179.30s -> 3180.18s]  I can't come.
[3180.18s -> 3180.82s]  I'm sorry.
[3180.82s -> 3182.74s]  Maybe another time.
[3182.74s -> 3184.99s]  Lead the way.
[3184.99s -> 3185.71s]  Take me with you.
[3185.71s -> 3190.59s]  The two hoofborns sling their spears and beckon you to one side.
[3190.59s -> 3194.35s]  Through a narrow way, almost invisible behind an outcrop of stone.
[3194.35s -> 3197.74s]  And then you begin to climb.
[3197.74s -> 3199.10s]  Into the peaks.
[3199.10s -> 3204.46s]  As the sun climbs the sky, the winds begin to rise.
[3204.46s -> 3208.70s]  After about 20 minutes of climbing, the hoofborns pause to let you catch your breath.
[3209.26s -> 3214.50s]  They are impressively nimble on the rocky paths, using their small hooves to perch on
[3214.50s -> 3215.54s]  narrow ledges.
[3215.54s -> 3219.90s]  As you continue, they even have to help you climb up unstable stretches.
[3219.90s -> 3223.76s]  Eventually, you spot a cluster of huts surrounding some caves.
[3223.76s -> 3228.58s]  Approach the village.
[3228.58s -> 3231.28s]  This is elaborate.
[3232.16s -> 3235.01s]  You follow your guides towards the village.
[3235.01s -> 3240.30s]  On an outcrop above, you spy two hoofborns standing guard, spears and rocks at the ready.
[3240.30s -> 3244.77s]  It seems these creatures take their protections seriously.
[3244.77s -> 3246.94s]  Now, you find Shihori.
[3246.94s -> 3249.18s]  One of your guides says to you,
[3249.18s -> 3252.22s]  She will be keen to hear of our companion's fate.
[3252.22s -> 3255.23s]  I will talk to her.
[3255.23s -> 3257.09s]  The hoofborn nod.
[3257.09s -> 3260.69s]  All right, well, we got a whole village here.
[3260.69s -> 3266.38s]  The village outskirts.
[3266.38s -> 3268.94s]  Your guides grow quiet as you enter the village.
[3268.94s -> 3272.46s]  There are a few well-maintained huts, but it is clear many of the hoofborns live in
[3272.46s -> 3274.22s]  holes in the cliff face.
[3274.22s -> 3277.25s]  Let's take a look.
[3277.25s -> 3279.73s]  From the outside, the caves appear clean and spacious.
[3279.73s -> 3282.77s]  A surprising number of hoofborns stream out to gawk at you.
[3282.77s -> 3287.23s]  These caves must honeycomb the entire mountainside.
[3287.23s -> 3291.15s]  An older hoofborn, draped in several hides, emerges from a larger cave.
[3291.15s -> 3295.76s]  One of your guides extends her arm straight out.
[3295.76s -> 3298.46s]  Shihori, Shihori, we have brought a visitor.
[3298.46s -> 3304.05s]  Shihori stretches her arms towards you, just as the guide did.
[3304.05s -> 3304.69s]  Welcome.
[3305.65s -> 3308.21s]  We do not entertain often.
[3308.21s -> 3314.78s]  You open your arms to begin casting a spell, but Shihori knocks your wrist apart with a
[3314.78s -> 3317.46s]  swift movement of the butt of her spear.
[3317.46s -> 3322.19s]  Do not think we do not understand the ways of sorcerers.
[3322.19s -> 3327.31s]  I know that to sever a sorcerer's hand is to remove their power.
[3327.31s -> 3329.47s]  Do not test me on my resolve.
[3334.10s -> 3334.99s]  Oops.
[3334.99s -> 3337.63s]  Sorry.
[3337.63s -> 3340.24s]  Accepted.
[3340.24s -> 3342.00s]  I found one of your villagers in a cave.
[3342.86s -> 3347.95s]  You tell her, relating your discovery of the dead hoofborn girl.
[3347.95s -> 3350.74s]  Ah yes, that was Shehimbli.
[3350.74s -> 3351.86s]  The poor creature.
[3351.86s -> 3357.57s]  She caught a terrible disease and rather than risk the village, she slipped out at night.
[3357.57s -> 3361.36s]  A scout saw her heading downslope looking for a place to die.
[3361.92s -> 3365.44s]  What disease?
[3365.44s -> 3368.18s]  The trembling sickness.
[3368.18s -> 3372.18s]  The plagues are kind and stalks the mountains like a vengeful ghost.
[3372.18s -> 3376.67s]  The creature looks up at you with large, bleary, goat-like eyes.
[3376.67s -> 3379.71s]  What did you do with her body?
[3379.71s -> 3381.01s]  She asks.
[3381.01s -> 3382.93s]  I buried it.
[3382.93s -> 3383.97s]  I burned it.
[3383.97s -> 3384.61s]  Nothing.
[3384.61s -> 3388.85s]  I buried it.
[3388.85s -> 3393.60s]  Then I must ask you to leave us.
[3393.60s -> 3395.84s]  Trembling sickness is most infectious.
[3395.84s -> 3400.58s]  We cannot take the chance.
[3400.58s -> 3401.78s]  I am not ill.
[3401.78s -> 3404.32s]  She looks uncertain.
[3404.32s -> 3406.08s]  You do not seem to have the symptoms.
[3408.34s -> 3410.50s]  Even as her spear point comes up.
[3410.50s -> 3416.02s]  The girl had been dead for some time.
[3416.02s -> 3418.98s]  You tell her, whatever disease she had was gone from her bones.
[3420.16s -> 3421.60s]  How the fuck do I know that?
[3421.60s -> 3422.88s]  What am I, a doctor?
[3422.88s -> 3423.76s]  Like a scientist?
[3423.76s -> 3424.80s]  How would I know that?
[3424.80s -> 3430.51s]  Shehori stares at you and shakes her head.
[3430.51s -> 3433.33s]  She lowers her spear.
[3433.33s -> 3435.65s]  I hope you are not lying to us, stranger.
[3435.65s -> 3439.04s]  We have lost too many to the disease already.
[3439.04s -> 3441.98s]  Shehori looks to your guide.
[3441.98s -> 3445.52s]  From where does this one come?
[3445.52s -> 3447.07s]  Anorand.
[3447.07s -> 3449.39s]  He claims to be on a quest.
[3449.39s -> 3450.27s]  Is that so?
[3450.27s -> 3452.43s]  She don't tell-
[3452.43s -> 3456.83s]  Ooh, it's a secret.
[3456.83s -> 3457.55s]  Indeed.
[3457.55s -> 3461.76s]  Do not tell me your purpose.
[3461.76s -> 3464.10s]  I just wish to know this.
[3464.10s -> 3466.02s]  Will it harm the Archmage?
[3466.02s -> 3469.26s]  Well, I mean, I hope so.
[3469.26s -> 3469.98s]  I hope so.
[3469.98s -> 3471.55s]  I hope so.
[3471.55s -> 3473.74s]  Greatly.
[3473.74s -> 3474.38s]  Greatly.
[3476.14s -> 3477.34s]  Excellent.
[3477.34s -> 3479.50s]  But you must be careful in Mampang.
[3479.50s -> 3482.88s]  It is a chaotic place and cruel.
[3482.88s -> 3488.34s]  The Archmage wields complete control, but does not always exercise it.
[3488.34s -> 3492.98s]  Petty crimes and suffering go unnoticed, but you will not.
[3492.98s -> 3495.41s]  He espies all of us, Amun.
[3495.41s -> 3500.30s]  It is likely he knows you are coming.
[3500.30s -> 3501.98s]  I took care of his serpents.
[3501.98s -> 3504.32s]  I do not think he does, not yet.
[3504.32s -> 3506.34s]  I will be wary.
[3506.34s -> 3508.72s]  I took care of his serpents.
[3508.72s -> 3510.74s]  Did you?
[3510.74s -> 3514.93s]  Then perhaps you have a chance after all.
[3514.93s -> 3516.29s]  Uh, can I come in?
[3516.29s -> 3517.66s]  Can I enter your village?
[3517.66s -> 3522.91s]  The hoof-borne leader makes a cantering step backwards and ducks her head.
[3522.91s -> 3524.16s]  Feel free.
[3524.16s -> 3525.52s]  Eat and rest.
[3525.52s -> 3526.56s]  You will be watched.
[3527.12s -> 3536.35s]  We also have items to trade, if you are willing.
[3536.35s -> 3537.71s]  You're diseased.
[3537.71s -> 3541.95s]  I, that's not confirmed.
[3541.95s -> 3543.39s]  I'm, that's not confirmed.
[3558.91s -> 3559.95s]  I am not.
[3562.21s -> 3565.10s]  Fuck.
[3565.10s -> 3566.38s]  But how, I don't know.
[3566.38s -> 3568.46s]  How long was she dead in there for?
[3568.46s -> 3571.73s]  Because that's a good point.
[3571.73s -> 3577.57s]  Like, how, it's been a while, right?
[3577.57s -> 3578.93s]  You step into the center of the village.
[3579.49s -> 3582.93s]  The watching hoof-borne gradually disperse back into their groups.
[3582.93s -> 3585.89s]  Some into caves, and others go to a gathering around a fire.
[3586.45s -> 3589.47s]  Ooh, a few places to go.
[3594.05s -> 3595.89s]  Uh, I got money, so let's go to the trader.
[3595.89s -> 3602.06s]  Against one rock face, a thin hoof-borne stands beside a few broken packing crates
[3602.06s -> 3603.58s]  stocked with trinkets.
[3603.58s -> 3605.76s]  He raises his hand as you approach in greeting.
[3605.76s -> 3608.50s]  Greetings.
[3611.66s -> 3613.58s]  This is, uh, what we have.
[3613.58s -> 3615.39s]  The trader tells you.
[3615.39s -> 3616.99s]  I'm afraid this is not much.
[3616.99s -> 3619.31s]  Perhaps something here will be of interest.
[3619.31s -> 3623.39s]  From across the clearing, you hear Shihori call out.
[3623.39s -> 3626.35s]  Treat this one fairly, Rohan.
[3626.35s -> 3628.27s]  He is a friend to our kind.
[3628.27s -> 3632.14s]  The trader nods.
[3632.14s -> 3633.98s]  Who do you trade with?
[3633.98s -> 3635.42s]  You ask, somewhat puzzled.
[3635.42s -> 3637.76s]  The poor creature shrugs slightly.
[3637.76s -> 3639.49s]  You are the first.
[3639.49s -> 3644.42s]  But one day, I hope to open a true trading post.
[3644.42s -> 3645.62s]  You peer into the crates.
[3645.62s -> 3649.76s]  The creature has a curious assortment of items.
[3649.76s -> 3653.15s]  Why is he, why is he German?
[3653.15s -> 3654.51s]  I don't know.
[3654.51s -> 3658.34s]  I looked over at chat, and I saw somebody say.
[3658.34s -> 3660.98s]  One year later, one voice.
[3660.98s -> 3662.26s]  And I said, you know what?
[3662.26s -> 3664.42s]  Fucking next one's gonna be German, okay?
[3664.42s -> 3665.62s]  That's what happened.
[3665.62s -> 3666.74s]  That is the truth.
[3666.74s -> 3670.34s]  That is what happened.
[3670.34s -> 3671.38s]  That's just the truth.
[3671.38s -> 3672.74s]  I have to tell you the truth.
[3672.74s -> 3676.10s]  You peer into the crates.
[3676.10s -> 3678.18s]  The creature has a curious assortment of items.
[3678.18s -> 3680.42s]  Some most likely highly valuable.
[3680.42s -> 3683.14s]  Others all but worthless.
[3683.14s -> 3685.28s]  It is almost a parody of a shop.
[3685.28s -> 3688.50s]  The crates are all labeled in scrawled writing.
[3688.50s -> 3692.34s]  The first is marked six gold, and the second 12 gold.
[3692.34s -> 3694.34s]  A spear leans against one of the crates.
[3694.34s -> 3698.05s]  Okay, well look in the expensive crate.
[3698.05s -> 3702.06s]  You scan the items in the high-priced crate.
[3702.06s -> 3704.30s]  A brass rod with a weight.
[3704.30s -> 3708.80s]  You lift a brass rod, which turns out to be a pendulum,
[3708.80s -> 3711.46s]  with a gently pivoted handle at its top.
[3711.46s -> 3714.66s]  It swings with an easy weight until the trader catches it.
[3715.46s -> 3716.51s]  None of that.
[3716.51s -> 3719.42s]  I won't have you casting any sleeping spells on me.
[3719.42s -> 3724.80s]  Okay.
[3724.80s -> 3725.76s]  Of course not.
[3725.76s -> 3729.57s]  What shopkeeper would fall for that?
[3729.57s -> 3731.70s]  Indeed.
[3731.70s -> 3734.22s]  Um, what was this, 12?
[3734.22s -> 3735.02s]  12 gold?
[3735.02s -> 3749.14s]  That's a lot of money.
[3749.14s -> 3750.99s]  You can never have too many items, though.
[3750.99s -> 3751.71s]  I'll get it.
[3751.71s -> 3755.39s]  A long brass pendulum only just fits into your backpack.
[3755.39s -> 3756.83s]  You hand over 12 gold pieces.
[3756.83s -> 3757.55s]  You look up once more.
[3757.55s -> 3760.35s]  There's nothing else in this box.
[3760.35s -> 3763.41s]  Look in the cheap crate.
[3763.41s -> 3765.25s]  The cheaper crate is mostly empty,
[3765.25s -> 3766.94s]  and you have to dig to find anything
[3766.94s -> 3770.62s]  amongst the sawdust in which things are kept.
[3770.62s -> 3773.06s]  A glass bottle.
[3773.06s -> 3775.33s]  A pair of nose plugs.
[3775.33s -> 3776.37s]  Orange rock dust.
[3776.37s -> 3778.66s]  An apple.
[3778.66s -> 3781.62s]  Uh, I think that's for, like, the smelly spell.
[3781.62s -> 3782.88s]  Hold on.
[3782.88s -> 3796.38s]  Let's see.
[3796.38s -> 3797.90s]  Yep.
[3797.90s -> 3798.62s]  It's nif.
[3799.49s -> 3803.01s]  The spell causes the air to fill with a nauseating stench so vile
[3803.01s -> 3806.40s]  that any creature catching a whiff will need to vomit.
[3806.40s -> 3808.24s]  This includes the caster.
[3808.24s -> 3810.18s]  Unless they are wearing nose plugs.
[3810.18s -> 3814.46s]  The effect is more pronounced on creatures with large noses.
[3814.46s -> 3821.63s]  Okay, so it's the puke spell.
[3821.63s -> 3822.67s]  Uh, how much?
[3822.67s -> 3825.86s]  No, I didn't want to click that.
[3825.86s -> 3828.26s]  The orange dust is piled in one corner of the crate,
[3828.26s -> 3832.56s]  but when you ask, the hoofhorn assures you it is for sale.
[3832.56s -> 3834.69s]  Finest ambergrind.
[3834.69s -> 3836.05s]  Better than xerost.
[3836.05s -> 3838.38s]  Even if you know what to do with it.
[3838.38s -> 3842.90s]  That was all of Europe in one accent.
[3842.90s -> 3843.30s]  I don't know.
[3843.30s -> 3844.82s]  That was remarkable how that happened.
[3844.82s -> 3846.94s]  Okay.
[3846.94s -> 3854.58s]  Um, what can I do with it?
[3854.58s -> 3855.38s]  And what is that?
[3856.94s -> 3860.88s]  I am no sorcerer.
[3860.88s -> 3861.76s]  Orange dust?
[3861.76s -> 3862.40s]  What is it?
[3862.40s -> 3866.42s]  What is orange dust used for?
[3866.42s -> 3866.82s]  Sand?
[3870.26s -> 3871.22s]  Firewater?
[3871.22s -> 3871.62s]  Mirror?
[3872.67s -> 3873.87s]  Yellow powder?
[3873.87s -> 3877.90s]  I mean, it's orange.
[3877.90s -> 3878.78s]  It was clearly orange.
[3879.34s -> 3887.95s]  Sun jewel.
[3887.95s -> 3888.75s]  I have most of these.
[3894.69s -> 3894.93s]  Orb.
[3895.49s -> 3900.74s]  It's an option to ask what it is.
[3901.70s -> 3902.82s]  I don't think he knows.
[3902.82s -> 3904.10s]  He said, I'm not a sorcerer.
[3904.10s -> 3904.74s]  How would I know?
[3905.78s -> 3906.58s]  Why would he own it?
[3907.30s -> 3910.27s]  Hey, what's this for?
[3910.83s -> 3912.51s]  It was orange and I picked it up off the ground.
[3913.07s -> 3916.29s]  Maybe it is just like sand.
[3916.93s -> 3930.94s]  I mean, I got money.
[3931.74s -> 3933.14s]  I got money.
[3933.78s -> 3937.36s]  How much was it?
[3937.36s -> 3938.32s]  Six gold, right?
[3938.32s -> 3938.80s]  I got money.
[3938.80s -> 3939.28s]  I'll buy it.
[3939.84s -> 3942.54s]  You pour the orange rock dust carefully into your pouch.
[3942.54s -> 3943.50s]  You pay the merchant.
[3943.50s -> 3945.73s]  You scan the remaining items in the crate.
[3945.73s -> 3947.33s]  Uh, how much are the nose plugs?
[3947.33s -> 3948.37s]  Six, right?
[3948.37s -> 3948.85s]  Yep.
[3948.85s -> 3949.73s]  Definitely want those.
[3951.31s -> 3953.49s]  A glass bottle.
[3953.49s -> 3955.49s]  Clear liquid inside of a glass bottle.
[3955.49s -> 3956.61s]  What does it smell like?
[3956.61s -> 3958.30s]  You go to remove the stopper.
[3959.02s -> 3959.50s]  What the?
[3959.50s -> 3959.82s]  Hold on.
[3959.82s -> 3960.46s]  Let me do that better.
[3961.60s -> 3966.51s]  You go to remove the stopper, but the hoof bone stops you.
[3966.51s -> 3967.55s]  It's fire water.
[3968.27s -> 3971.07s]  It evaporates extremely fast once exposed to air.
[3971.07s -> 3977.90s]  So buy it if you want to drink it.
[3977.90s -> 3978.78s]  Oh, I want that.
[3978.78s -> 3982.91s]  Give it to me.
[3982.91s -> 3983.39s]  Okay.
[3983.39s -> 3985.54s]  What about an apple?
[3985.54s -> 3989.14s]  An old apple sits in sawdust in surprisingly good condition,
[3989.14s -> 3991.57s]  considering it must've been here for some time.
[3991.57s -> 3992.69s]  Uh, it's food.
[3992.69s -> 3995.47s]  I want it.
[3995.47s -> 3997.63s]  Oh shit.
[3997.63s -> 4001.07s]  There's a spear.
[4001.07s -> 4003.78s]  You lift the spear and the trader nods.
[4003.78s -> 4007.52s]  It is a blessed hardwood spear, which is virtually unbreakable.
[4007.92s -> 4012.61s]  And very expensive indeed.
[4012.61s -> 4013.49s]  How much?
[4013.49s -> 4017.10s]  A 70 gold pieces.
[4017.10s -> 4018.62s]  That is robbery.
[4018.62s -> 4021.25s]  But the trader shrugs.
[4021.25s -> 4024.30s]  No, robbery would be anything else.
[4024.30s -> 4025.62s]  But nevermind.
[4025.62s -> 4028.35s]  You need not buy it after all.
[4028.35s -> 4029.47s]  I have seen enough.
[4029.47s -> 4031.39s]  You thank the trader and move away.
[4031.39s -> 4039.30s]  How would you ever have 70 gold at this point in the fourth game?
[4039.30s -> 4041.68s]  70 gold.
[4041.68s -> 4044.08s]  I guess if you just didn't buy a bunch of bullshit like I did.
[4044.08s -> 4046.03s]  Okay.
[4046.03s -> 4046.75s]  I've seen enough.
[4046.75s -> 4047.79s]  Thank the trader and move away.
[4047.79s -> 4048.51s]  The village is small.
[4048.51s -> 4050.43s]  There could be more than a hundred.
[4050.43s -> 4055.62s]  It could be not more than a hundred inhabitants.
[4055.62s -> 4060.53s]  Uh, this is shihori.
[4061.78s -> 4065.20s]  Fire.
[4065.20s -> 4068.67s]  And viewpoint.
[4068.67s -> 4069.79s]  Sell your teeth.
[4069.79s -> 4071.73s]  I think there was only one place I could do that.
[4071.73s -> 4075.28s]  Let me go look at the viewpoint.
[4075.28s -> 4078.64s]  On the north side of the village is a lookout point that offers a spectacular view across
[4078.64s -> 4080.32s]  the valley below.
[4080.32s -> 4084.80s]  You stay for a while, watching birdmen circling the peaks across the ravine to the north.
[4084.80s -> 4086.96s]  One of the hoof-born comes to join you.
[4086.96s -> 4092.26s]  They are cruel creatures born of pure hate.
[4092.26s -> 4099.31s]  But they say they are nesting in the mountains outside Manhang.
[4099.31s -> 4100.99s]  All birds make nests.
[4100.99s -> 4102.91s]  We are not birds.
[4102.91s -> 4104.51s]  No more than we are goats.
[4104.51s -> 4107.89s]  Birdmen cannot have children of their own.
[4107.89s -> 4111.23s]  Only the Archmage can birth them.
[4111.23s -> 4115.71s]  Looking around, you suddenly notice the tru-eees had he said something true.
[4116.58s -> 4119.06s]  In the whole village, you have not seen a single infant.
[4126.26s -> 4133.23s]  Oh, that's like, that has, that's like top five best chat message of the last like month.
[4133.23s -> 4134.11s]  Oh my goodness.
[4134.83s -> 4139.52s]  Uh, somebody said from software Trump.
[4139.52s -> 4140.48s]  God damn it.
[4140.48s -> 4143.18s]  Like, don't you just get mad when you don't, like, I wish I thought of that.
[4143.18s -> 4147.87s]  Like, I wish I thought of something that funny.
[4147.87s -> 4149.31s]  That's so funny.
[4149.31s -> 4151.15s]  Okay, well, I'm gonna, that's what I'm doing.
[4151.15s -> 4156.05s]  That's what this person sounds like.
[4156.05s -> 4160.45s]  So, I don't even remember how, I don't even remember, I don't remember the voice now because
[4160.45s -> 4162.85s]  I'm so, I'm thinking about it too much.
[4162.85s -> 4165.44s]  So why do they build nests?
[4165.44s -> 4167.28s]  The hoof-born man shakes his head.
[4167.28s -> 4168.64s]  I do not know.
[4169.71s -> 4171.63s]  It's a mystery.
[4171.63s -> 4176.77s]  Perhaps they believe that nests will make eggs come.
[4176.77s -> 4177.65s]  I cannot say.
[4179.15s -> 4190.10s]  You cannot have children of your own.
[4190.10s -> 4191.06s]  We cannot.
[4191.06s -> 4195.06s]  The hoof-born strikes his chest with a palm.
[4195.06s -> 4197.47s]  Ow, I did that in real life.
[4197.47s -> 4199.86s]  Go in peace, stranger.
[4205.97s -> 4206.69s]  Believe me.
[4209.04s -> 4214.50s]  Uh, the fire.
[4214.50s -> 4217.84s]  You go over to the fire and sit down with the gathered hoof-born.
[4217.84s -> 4221.12s]  They're sharing out a meal that smells of oranges and charred wood.
[4223.31s -> 4224.27s]  Uh, I will eat.
[4224.83s -> 4228.88s]  You sit with the hoof-born and share their meal.
[4228.88s -> 4233.84s]  It is a greasy chunk of meat with some kind of sweet glaze that smells of oranges.
[4233.84s -> 4236.46s]  It sits in a bowl of small grains and is very filling.
[4236.46s -> 4237.50s]  That sounds good.
[4237.50s -> 4240.42s]  That sounds great, actually.
[4240.42s -> 4241.46s]  Doesn't that sound good?
[4241.46s -> 4252.29s]  Ah, fresh water with some delicious...
[4252.29s -> 4254.67s]  What's in here?
[4254.67s -> 4262.16s]  I put something in it.
[4262.16s -> 4263.04s]  No, not vodka.
[4267.23s -> 4269.15s]  Yeah, I put vodka in my water.
[4269.15s -> 4269.79s]  No, what?
[4271.55s -> 4273.15s]  That would be terrible.
[4273.15s -> 4274.19s]  Paint thinner.
[4278.91s -> 4281.18s]  No, not that either.
[4281.18s -> 4284.38s]  It's like a little, like, hydration packet thing.
[4286.16s -> 4287.12s]  Okay, here we go.
[4287.12s -> 4288.75s]  Let's talk.
[4288.75s -> 4292.94s]  Since the hoof-born are so entranced with the wider world,
[4292.94s -> 4295.26s]  you offer to tell them of your adventures.
[4295.26s -> 4298.34s]  They surround you with eager faces as you speak of the gloomy,
[4298.34s -> 4303.94s]  abandoned house of the blind noble Theta and the austere meeting hall of the council.
[4303.94s -> 4307.36s]  You tell them the story of your journey through the vast plains.
[4307.36s -> 4312.14s]  You tell them about Lake Eklala and your battle with the dreaded water serpent.
[4312.14s -> 4316.54s]  They clearly do not believe half of what you say, but enjoy the adventure nonetheless.
[4316.54s -> 4319.87s]  They look wistfully across the mountains when you are finished.
[4319.87s -> 4323.98s]  The fire smolders gently.
[4323.98s -> 4325.18s]  Ask about the archmage.
[4325.18s -> 4328.64s]  What can you tell me of the archmage?
[4328.64s -> 4331.02s]  One of the goat people shrugs.
[4331.02s -> 4332.06s]  Another laughs.
[4332.06s -> 4337.10s]  Strange rumors come out of Manpang, stranger.
[4337.66s -> 4339.50s]  Strange rumors indeed.
[4339.50s -> 4343.55s]  I can imagine.
[4343.55s -> 4350.43s]  There are those merchants and traders, mostly, who say Manpang is run by the guards.
[4350.43s -> 4355.74s]  They say the archmage does not appear.
[4355.74s -> 4358.66s]  Perhaps he is a recluse.
[4358.66s -> 4360.58s]  The goat person shrugs once more.
[4360.58s -> 4364.16s]  Merchants say he is dead.
[4364.16s -> 4368.61s]  They say if he was alive he would be over a thousand years old.
[4368.61s -> 4370.26s]  But who can say?
[4370.26s -> 4375.30s]  It is certainly true he never steps outside of Manpang.
[4375.30s -> 4378.45s]  That is all they will say.
[4378.45s -> 4380.85s]  You get to your feet once more and look around the village.
[4380.85s -> 4383.78s]  There are some youths playing around in the dirt.
[4383.78s -> 4385.94s]  They're hairier than their elders.
[4385.94s -> 4388.32s]  Some are using all four legs.
[4388.32s -> 4390.40s]  Do they grow into their humanity?
[4390.40s -> 4405.76s]  Or are the younger ones simply more goat-like due to the archmage's interference?
[4405.76s -> 4410.75s]  You approach Shihori, who is seated outside a largest hut, and nod a greeting.
[4410.75s -> 4411.55s]  Greetings.
[4412.11s -> 4417.57s]  I hope you are finding our village comfortable.
[4417.57s -> 4418.37s]  Thank you.
[4418.37s -> 4422.35s]  This will be your last respite, I think.
[4422.35s -> 4428.13s]  Shihori looks away into the distance, and for the first time you notice that her eyes
[4428.13s -> 4430.53s]  are blurry and weak.
[4430.53s -> 4435.71s]  You are blind?
[4435.71s -> 4439.26s]  Not yet, but I lose sight with every passing year.
[4439.26s -> 4442.50s]  We are all made.
[4442.50s -> 4443.38s]  Creatures.
[4443.38s -> 4447.23s]  But not made to last.
[4447.23s -> 4448.35s]  You've been to Manpang.
[4451.33s -> 4452.93s]  We used to live in Manpang.
[4452.93s -> 4454.82s]  Several of us.
[4454.82s -> 4457.15s]  At any rate, we escaped.
[4457.15s -> 4464.26s]  You were the archmage's prisoners?
[4464.26s -> 4467.06s]  Of a sort.
[4467.06s -> 4470.32s]  No, you were experiments?
[4470.32s -> 4472.45s]  Yes.
[4472.45s -> 4474.05s]  We.
[4474.05s -> 4474.93s]  Yes, we.
[4474.93s -> 4477.86s]  That is horrifying.
[4477.86s -> 4481.78s]  She stomps once, a sharp sound that echoes through the nearby caves.
[4481.78s -> 4484.80s]  We are not horrors, she says.
[4485.36s -> 4488.88s]  We are the product of cruelty, but that does not define us.
[4488.88s -> 4496.58s]  Can you tell me of the birdmen?
[4496.58s -> 4498.90s]  What will your people do?
[4498.90s -> 4501.81s]  I'm told you cannot have children.
[4501.81s -> 4504.85s]  There's nothing we can do.
[4504.85s -> 4509.26s]  They must live as well as they can.
[4509.26s -> 4510.14s]  That is all.
[4510.14s -> 4514.02s]  You nod and turn to leave.
[4514.02s -> 4517.26s]  One last thing before you step away.
[4517.26s -> 4522.30s]  If you should find the archmage.
[4522.30s -> 4523.84s]  Yes?
[4523.84s -> 4525.84s]  Kill him without hesitation.
[4525.84s -> 4536.90s]  With that she looks away, her weak eyes searching the distant horizons for answers.
[4536.90s -> 4538.19s]  I will.
[4538.19s -> 4539.07s]  I will.
[4539.07s -> 4548.99s]  You head for the edge of the village, but Shihori clip-clops over to you.
[4548.99s -> 4554.02s]  She is armed now with a long and heavy spear which she levels at you.
[4554.02s -> 4554.58s]  What?
[4554.58s -> 4557.31s]  Shihori?
[4557.31s -> 4563.65s]  Shihori holds your gaze for a moment, then flips the spear around to lie handle first.
[4563.65s -> 4567.09s]  It's a blessed spear.
[4567.09s -> 4568.69s]  Take it.
[4568.69s -> 4569.81s]  As a thanks.
[4569.81s -> 4574.18s]  It may help you to penetrate the defenses that surround the archmage.
[4574.18s -> 4578.27s]  This thing was 70 bucks?
[4578.27s -> 4582.40s]  I almost bought this, if I had the money.
[4582.40s -> 4587.25s]  Go sell it for 70 gold.
[4587.25s -> 4588.05s]  Thank you.
[4588.05s -> 4589.54s]  I am honored.
[4589.54s -> 4592.03s]  You take the spear and strap it to your back.
[4592.03s -> 4596.37s]  It feels as promised most firmly made.
[4596.37s -> 4601.12s]  Now go, and may the gods of the old world be with you.
[4601.12s -> 4602.98s]  You turn to take your leave.
[4602.98s -> 4605.14s]  A guard accompanies you back to the main path.
[4605.14s -> 4609.50s]  You're grateful for it, as the route is so steep you risk a fall without help.
[4609.50s -> 4613.66s]  So how, let me see, what is this thing?
[4613.66s -> 4614.70s]  How good is it?
[4614.70s -> 4619.89s]  Blessed hardwood spear.
[4622.16s -> 4625.52s]  Hardwood spear declared to be unbreakable by the hoofborne.
[4625.52s -> 4628.38s]  I have a lot of weapons.
[4632.22s -> 4632.70s]  Interesting.
[4633.26s -> 4636.91s]  Now this is really funny.
[4636.91s -> 4650.59s]  Once at the road, your guide extends his arms in the hoofborne bow.
[4652.56s -> 4655.76s]  Thank you for your news and stories, traveler.
[4655.76s -> 4658.19s]  But we would appreciate if you did not return.
[4658.91s -> 4662.38s]  We cannot risk a spy from Mampang following you to discover our home.
[4665.78s -> 4670.34s]  I will destroy Mampang!
[4671.22s -> 4676.32s]  He smiles, extends his arms again, and disappears up the narrow path.
[4676.32s -> 4682.78s]  Okay, back to the trail.
[4682.78s -> 4684.14s]  Am I gonna be okay going down here?
[4686.91s -> 4689.87s]  You skitter and scramble the last few lengths down to the trail once more.
[4689.87s -> 4694.48s]  The sun is beginning to lower and the air begins to cool.
[4694.48s -> 4695.92s]  Look for the hoofborne path.
[4695.92s -> 4697.36s]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[4698.70s -> 4701.50s]  You look back trying to find the path by which you climbed up into the peaks,
[4701.50s -> 4706.27s]  but after a few false starts, you've managed to nothing but a few scrapes and falls.
[4706.27s -> 4710.11s]  Perhaps you only ever had the confidence to climb such a slope
[4710.11s -> 4712.35s]  because the hoofborne were leading you.
[4712.35s -> 4716.19s]  At any rate, the curious cave village now is vanished from reach.
[4716.19s -> 4719.52s]  The path runs in both directions along the chasm edge.
[4719.52s -> 4722.11s]  All right, so what is this way?
[4722.75s -> 4731.49s]  Go over here, and go over here.
[4732.13s -> 4739.98s]  There's gonna be a few opportunities across the bridge, but what is this?
[4739.98s -> 4740.78s]  I want to know what that is.
[4741.34s -> 4747.81s]  Bro, you're a wizard, just float.
[4747.81s -> 4751.86s]  Well, we're gonna go this way anyway.
[4751.86s -> 4758.11s]  You walk along the edge of a sharp ledge which looks down to the deep chasm.
[4758.11s -> 4761.87s]  The gap is wide, but across it you can see a path winding through the mountains
[4761.87s -> 4763.07s]  towards Banpeng Fortress.
[4763.71s -> 4767.09s]  A rope hangs suspended in midair above the chasm.
[4767.09s -> 4770.29s]  Its near end is coiled up neatly on the path.
[4770.29s -> 4774.27s]  That's probably a trap.
[4774.27s -> 4775.65s]  Let's find out.
[4776.29s -> 4788.48s]  Okay, there's one way to do it.
[4789.12s -> 4795.12s]  Read minds of who.
[4795.76s -> 4800.40s]  I mean, we're gonna go for it.
[4800.40s -> 4801.12s]  One stamina.
[4804.14s -> 4804.86s]  Weave the enchantment.
[4804.86s -> 4806.46s]  A quiet voice enters your mind.
[4807.18s -> 4809.82s]  The voice informs you that the rope swing is a trap.
[4810.54s -> 4812.14s]  But so are the bridges.
[4812.14s -> 4813.10s]  And the path ahead.
[4813.92s -> 4817.12s]  And then before it can offer anything more useful, the voice fades from your mind.
[4817.12s -> 4818.48s]  So everything sucks.
[4818.48s -> 4820.82s]  Okay, good.
[4820.82s -> 4822.58s]  Hey, be careful.
[4822.58s -> 4824.86s]  That rope swing is a trap.
[4824.86s -> 4826.22s]  So are all the bridges.
[4826.22s -> 4827.66s]  So are all the paths.
[4827.66s -> 4829.42s]  So are all the foods.
[4829.42s -> 4830.94s]  So is the air that you breathe.
[4831.50s -> 4833.34s]  Everything is going to kill you.
[4833.34s -> 4836.74s]  Good luck.
[4836.74s -> 4839.39s]  Everything is sus.
[4839.39s -> 4840.51s]  You are fucked.
[4845.97s -> 4850.83s]  Um, I guess it doesn't really matter.
[4850.83s -> 4853.15s]  Looking to your right, you notice the trail continues.
[4853.15s -> 4854.99s]  You think you see a bridge in the distance.
[4854.99s -> 4857.47s]  What else can I do?
[4867.49s -> 4869.01s]  That's not a bad one either.
[4869.01s -> 4876.94s]  You cast the spell, expecting the calm voice of the enchantment to talk into your ear.
[4877.58s -> 4878.62s]  But it does not come.
[4879.50s -> 4883.58s]  Instead, without any explanation, the rope's invisible anchor point seems to evaporate.
[4883.58s -> 4887.23s]  And the rope plunges away into the ravine and is gone.
[4887.23s -> 4888.51s]  Definitely a fixed spell.
[4889.23s -> 4890.27s]  Countered by how?
[4892.24s -> 4895.23s]  Oh, okay.
[4897.34s -> 4898.94s]  You lean over, looking down the chasm.
[4898.94s -> 4900.38s]  I knew it wasn't gonna be that easy.
[4900.38s -> 4902.32s]  There is no sign of the rope.
[4902.32s -> 4905.76s]  At the bottom, you can make out a rocky path that winds out of view.
[4905.76s -> 4911.04s]  It is all but hidden below a layer of fog.
[4911.04s -> 4912.00s]  Uh, I'm gonna keep going.
[4912.56s -> 4917.74s]  I'm gonna go all the way to the end here, if I can.
[4917.74s -> 4923.25s]  The rope was clearly a deathtrap.
[4923.25s -> 4926.45s]  You leave it behind, walking towards the bridge in the distance.
[4926.45s -> 4930.13s]  For a moment, you seem to see something moving on the slopes above you.
[4930.69s -> 4932.53s]  Well, let's look.
[4933.98s -> 4935.58s]  You look up but can see nothing.
[4935.58s -> 4938.74s]  A hoofborn, perhaps, watching your progress.
[4938.74s -> 4939.22s]  Wave.
[4940.35s -> 4940.85s]  Hey!
[4941.31s -> 4944.18s]  A few moments later, a rock strikes you on the temple,
[4944.18s -> 4956.37s]  though you do not see if it was thrown or if it simply fell.
[4956.37s -> 4956.93s]  Okay.
[4956.93s -> 4959.25s]  Apparently, it didn't hurt very much.
[4961.60s -> 4962.16s]  Make a move.
[4962.80s -> 4964.48s]  Who's throwing rocks at me?
[4964.48s -> 4964.72s]  Why?
[4965.84s -> 4967.20s]  It has to be somebody from here.
[4969.20s -> 4969.84s]  What the fuck?
[4972.77s -> 4974.77s]  You definitely have a dent in your temple now.
[4974.77s -> 4975.09s]  Yeah.
[4977.38s -> 4978.26s]  It's Gollum.
[4981.74s -> 4987.94s]  That's Shibirri the rock thrower.
[4987.94s -> 4988.58s]  Shibirri.
[4988.58s -> 4992.03s]  Shibirri is Elden Ring.
[4992.03s -> 4992.99s]  Shibirri.
[4992.99s -> 4997.95s]  Okay.
[4997.95s -> 5001.63s]  You head along the path until you reach the foot of the sturdy-looking bridge
[5001.63s -> 5003.07s]  that spans the chasm here.
[5003.07s -> 5005.63s]  The sun begins to dip, heading towards the horizon.
[5005.63s -> 5009.84s]  Sturdy-looking bridge that spans the chasm here.
[5009.84s -> 5014.45s]  I am not going over that bridge.
[5015.01s -> 5025.18s]  Uh, Bugleberry told me it was unsafe.
[5025.18s -> 5026.78s]  Make chaos!
[5026.78s -> 5028.98s]  Take the world!
[5028.98s -> 5032.56s]  The wind picks up as the evening draws on.
[5032.56s -> 5034.61s]  It will be dark soon.
[5034.61s -> 5036.13s]  Continuing around the side of the mountain,
[5036.13s -> 5040.61s]  your hopes are lifted as the path up ahead pinches and curves back in on itself.
[5040.61s -> 5044.88s]  The chasm itself has shrunk to a small gap.
[5044.88s -> 5046.40s]  Oh, I can jump this.
[5046.40s -> 5049.33s]  Or should I?
[5049.33s -> 5054.14s]  Should I just keep going?
[5054.14s -> 5056.14s]  Look across.
[5056.14s -> 5060.48s]  Looking across the chasm, there is a rough path cleft into the far peak.
[5060.48s -> 5063.68s]  It curves away out of sight, roughly in the direction of Manpang.
[5063.68s -> 5072.13s]  Does that say judge the gap or fudge the gap?
[5072.13s -> 5074.77s]  Okay, it's judge.
[5074.77s -> 5077.65s]  The gap cannot be much wider than a stride and a half.
[5077.65s -> 5082.75s]  With a decent run-up, you should be able to make it.
[5082.75s -> 5093.34s]  Uh, should I jump it or should I just keep going?
[5093.34s -> 5094.38s]  Just fudge it?
[5094.38s -> 5095.74s]  All right, I'm gonna fudge it.
[5095.74s -> 5101.07s]  You take a run-up, rush forward, and hurl yourself into open space.
[5104.67s -> 5108.96s]  The jump is short and you are confident until a moment before you land
[5108.96s -> 5113.92s]  when two strong talons scream down out of the sky and skewer through your shoulders.
[5116.18s -> 5116.66s]  Look up.
[5118.69s -> 5122.77s]  You twist your head up and find yourself staring at the feathered lower body of a birdman.
[5123.33s -> 5127.12s]  Then you are being dragged up into the air,
[5127.12s -> 5136.30s]  each wingbeat sending arcs of pain throughout your body.
[5136.30s -> 5138.54s]  Okay, I think I remember this.
[5138.54s -> 5140.30s]  I remember this is possible.
[5140.86s -> 5145.55s]  The mountains become a furry gray.
[5147.33s -> 5148.53s]  I was gonna say fury.
[5149.09s -> 5151.73s]  The mountains become a furry gray as you rise.
[5151.73s -> 5155.01s]  The ravines are now nothing but deep black scars.
[5155.01s -> 5156.74s]  Cast a spell.
[5156.74s -> 5158.80s]  You try to spread your arms to cast a spell,
[5158.80s -> 5163.60s]  but the talons have been skewered expertly to prevent your arms from lifting upwards.
[5163.60s -> 5168.11s]  The creature wheels in the sky, growing with evil delight.
[5168.11s -> 5169.41s]  It is still rising.
[5169.41s -> 5173.23s]  Oh, shit.
[5173.23s -> 5180.10s]  The birdman screams out in a cruel and vibrant voice.
[5180.66s -> 5184.13s]  Threaten the creature.
[5184.13s -> 5185.89s]  You scream a threat at the bird.
[5185.89s -> 5188.05s]  Brutal, angry, disgusted.
[5188.05s -> 5193.38s]  Perhaps the creature takes offense, or perhaps it was always going to do the same thing.
[5193.38s -> 5195.78s]  Either way, a moment later, the talons open.
[5195.78s -> 5199.60s]  The birdman banks above a peak as it releases you,
[5199.60s -> 5210.43s]  and you tumble downwards through the air.
[5210.43s -> 5211.87s]  My health!
[5211.87s -> 5213.63s]  I just lost, like, all my health.
[5213.63s -> 5220.86s]  You land somewhere with a heavy thump that knocks all the wind from your frame.
[5220.86s -> 5224.38s]  You're on some kind of loose straw, which has cushioned you.
[5225.57s -> 5229.01s]  Overhead, the birdman wheels and circles away.
[5229.01s -> 5235.25s]  Presumably, it believes you cannot leave the ground.
[5235.25s -> 5239.06s]  It takes a moment to realize where you are.
[5239.06s -> 5240.66s]  This is a nest.
[5240.66s -> 5244.38s]  The nest is an intricate construction of twigs and branches
[5244.38s -> 5246.62s]  built into a natural cleft in the peak.
[5246.62s -> 5249.42s]  The wind whips past a short distance away.
[5249.42s -> 5252.83s]  Everything it can grasp has already been taken.
[5252.83s -> 5257.15s]  On one side is a dark hole in the straw that might be large enough for you to crawl through.
[5262.27s -> 5263.39s]  Strike a light?
[5263.39s -> 5269.44s]  Should I wait?
[5270.08s -> 5273.50s]  I don't want to burn my spellbook.
[5274.30s -> 5277.89s]  I'm going to go inside.
[5278.69s -> 5282.75s]  You crawl through the hole into the heart of the nest.
[5282.75s -> 5283.31s]  I'm going in.
[5283.95s -> 5291.07s]  The inside of the nest is a curious bell-shaped chamber open to the sky.
[5291.63s -> 5296.27s]  The walls are of woven straw, matted with feathers and scraps of fur.
[5298.80s -> 5299.44s]  Search the nest.
[5300.08s -> 5303.66s]  You poke around the nest, eventually coming across a black face mask
[5303.66s -> 5305.50s]  packed roughly into one of the walls.
[5306.06s -> 5310.00s]  But as you weigh your find in your hands, you hear a shriek from behind you.
[5310.00s -> 5312.13s]  Draw my sword.
[5312.13s -> 5312.63s]  Oh boy.
[5314.58s -> 5318.98s]  You draw your sword as talons rake down your back, leaving deep cuts.
[5319.62s -> 5322.02s]  You roll away, dodging another slash.
[5322.02s -> 5326.82s]  Once on your feet, you come face to face with the nest's owner, who has returned.
[5326.82s -> 5331.78s]  The birdman's wings are outstretched, clawed hands already up and ready to tear at your body.
[5331.78s -> 5334.26s]  The vicious talons drip with your blood.
[5336.08s -> 5336.72s]  Full blast.
[5337.28s -> 5338.38s]  Probably a bad idea.
[5339.46s -> 5340.42s]  Uhhhh.
[5340.42s -> 5349.42s]  The birdman charges across the nest, spitting and cursing.
[5349.42s -> 5352.94s]  You squat into a defensive crouch, blade raised.
[5352.94s -> 5355.28s]  The birdman rushes at you before slipping aside,
[5355.28s -> 5358.32s]  moments before he strikes, merely scraping at your defenses.
[5358.32s -> 5360.32s]  You escape mostly unscathed.
[5360.32s -> 5365.47s]  The birdman opens his beak to cry, and his feet worry at the ground.
[5365.47s -> 5368.38s]  All right, well, definitely coming in hard now.
[5369.34s -> 5369.82s]  Really?
[5369.82s -> 5370.32s]  That's it?
[5373.04s -> 5373.84s]  Shit.
[5373.84s -> 5375.04s]  I'm so nervous.
[5375.04s -> 5376.08s]  He's got so much-
[5376.08s -> 5378.43s]  You stay low.
[5378.43s -> 5382.43s]  The birdman tries to slice you with a lazy slash of his claws, but you duck.
[5382.43s -> 5385.86s]  The birdman issues a bloody call and spreads its wings.
[5385.86s -> 5387.22s]  All right, you don't have enough.
[5387.22s -> 5387.72s]  Full blast.
[5388.50s -> 5389.46s]  That's a huge blow.
[5391.66s -> 5393.18s]  That's a massive deal.
[5393.90s -> 5397.97s]  Okay.
[5397.97s -> 5404.05s]  Your blade sings as it parts the air, cutting straight through his own vicious, ragged attack.
[5404.69s -> 5406.54s]  You cut the birdman deep into his belly.
[5406.54s -> 5408.78s]  The creature howls at you in fury.
[5408.78s -> 5410.46s]  He clicks together long nails once more.
[5410.46s -> 5413.04s]  He is still determined to fight.
[5413.04s -> 5413.84s]  Let's go again, then.
[5414.48s -> 5415.60s]  Oh, you're fucking done.
[5416.72s -> 5422.50s]  Okay, the creature screams in a blood-curdling tongue.
[5422.50s -> 5424.18s]  He stretches his cruel nails.
[5427.54s -> 5428.58s]  Do I still have more?
[5429.22s -> 5430.66s]  I think I still might have more than-
[5431.70s -> 5432.20s]  Yep.
[5433.79s -> 5434.83s]  All right, nah, I gotta defend.
[5435.71s -> 5439.89s]  You cut a side blow.
[5439.89s -> 5441.49s]  The birdman wails as your blow connects.
[5441.49s -> 5442.93s]  He rises sharply backwards.
[5442.93s -> 5444.45s]  He stretches his long nails.
[5445.25s -> 5446.05s]  Uh, I have to defend.
[5446.05s -> 5446.61s]  I don't have enough.
[5447.49s -> 5448.45s]  I may have-
[5449.09s -> 5450.13s]  That was like 1.8.
[5454.80s -> 5455.12s]  Nice.
[5455.12s -> 5455.60s]  All right, got it.
[5457.39s -> 5458.43s]  Uh, I'm just going in again.
[5459.15s -> 5461.74s]  Just barely, but I got it.
[5462.46s -> 5465.12s]  Another chance follows.
[5465.12s -> 5467.12s]  You jump through the air, hoping to catch the creature.
[5467.12s -> 5470.48s]  The birdman falls to the ground, feathers drifting from his body.
[5470.48s -> 5473.84s]  The savage light in his eyes has gone dark.
[5473.84s -> 5479.70s]  While the birdmen may be delicately boned, they are vicious fighters.
[5480.26s -> 5482.90s]  You stagger back against the straw, grasping for-
[5482.90s -> 5484.50s]  Yeah, your breath is gone.
[5484.50s -> 5486.10s]  Look at you.
[5486.10s -> 5489.14s]  All right, let's get that mask.
[5489.14s -> 5490.98s]  You look around the chamber with interest.
[5491.84s -> 5492.64s]  It is all wrong.
[5493.28s -> 5498.29s]  It is as though the birdmen are not sure exactly how a proper nest should be made.
[5498.29s -> 5500.59s]  This place is a weird hybrid.
[5500.59s -> 5502.91s]  Part nest and part straw hut.
[5502.91s -> 5507.07s]  You crawl back out of the nest.
[5507.07s -> 5508.03s]  Did I get the mask?
[5508.59s -> 5517.10s]  I got it.
[5517.10s -> 5523.44s]  Okay, back outside.
[5528.46s -> 5532.06s]  Uh, can I strike a light without my-
[5532.78s -> 5534.80s]  You bend down and spark a flame.
[5535.36s -> 5539.12s]  A moment later, the flame has jumped to the dry straw of the nest.
[5539.20s -> 5541.36s]  The delicate twigs begin to glow and curl.
[5542.37s -> 5543.01s]  Oh, shit.
[5546.74s -> 5551.81s]  Hold on, let me read this again.
[5551.81s -> 5555.25s]  You emerge into the fresh air and biting wind on the edge of the cliff.
[5555.25s -> 5557.33s]  Night has fallen and you are worn out.
[5557.33s -> 5559.65s]  You should find somewhere safe to sleep.
[5559.65s -> 5562.45s]  For if you keep going through the night, you will be weaker for it.
[5562.45s -> 5564.69s]  And then I just burnt the whole fucking place down.
[5564.69s -> 5566.29s]  I have to extinguish the flames.
[5566.29s -> 5569.81s]  You stamp out the flames, but they have spread too far and are too fast to put out.
[5572.69s -> 5577.65s]  You wait, cruelly admiring your handiwork as the nest roars into a pyre.
[5577.97s -> 5580.82s]  There's nothing else to do but risk the climb down to the path.
[5580.82s -> 5583.06s]  It cannot be more dangerous than staying here.
[5583.06s -> 5584.90s]  This was a perfect place to sleep.
[5584.90s -> 5586.58s]  And to eat something.
[5592.54s -> 5592.78s]  Shit.
[5594.50s -> 5597.06s]  You clamber slowly and carefully back down to the path.
[5597.06s -> 5601.22s]  Smoke plumes from the nest above, trailing into the sky.
[5601.22s -> 5605.22s]  You can only hope no one in Mampang is watching.
[5605.22s -> 5607.30s]  Uh, that's very bad.
[5607.30s -> 5609.86s]  That is very bad.
[5609.86s -> 5617.18s]  I might have to rewind that.
[5620.40s -> 5622.99s]  Yep, I'm gonna use one of my three rewinds.
[5626.94s -> 5628.06s]  Because he's gonna see.
[5628.78s -> 5631.15s]  Okay, climb down.
[5633.70s -> 5634.58s]  Yeah, I'm cheating.
[5634.58s -> 5634.98s]  It's fine.
[5635.78s -> 5642.72s]  Okay, so here's the thing.
[5643.98s -> 5645.98s]  I could go up through here.
[5646.62s -> 5653.71s]  Or I could go down and I would have been crossed the bridge and over here.
[5654.27s -> 5656.59s]  I guess I could also go this way too.
[5656.59s -> 5657.79s]  No, I don't think so.
[5661.26s -> 5661.82s]  There's this.
[5661.82s -> 5662.54s]  There's also this.
[5663.18s -> 5671.02s]  I'm not sure.
[5672.16s -> 5674.00s]  But I know I'm gonna go at least up here.
[5677.14s -> 5679.14s]  You head down a slight incline.
[5679.14s -> 5681.62s]  Mampang looms into view once more.
[5681.62s -> 5685.84s]  It is as though these mountain passes had been carved to ensure no one approaching could
[5685.84s -> 5688.16s]  forget the citadel's looming presence.
[5691.14s -> 5691.62s]  Look ahead.
[5692.93s -> 5697.41s]  Looking at the path ahead, you see the ground appear to buckle where a sharp rock rim rises
[5697.41s -> 5698.13s]  out of the ground.
[5698.85s -> 5703.25s]  Before you lies a deep crater, as though an entire mountain peak had been scooped away.
[5703.25s -> 5704.53s]  You will have to find a way across.
[5705.09s -> 5709.15s]  The moon moves slowly across the dark sky.
[5709.79s -> 5718.34s]  You climb over the rim of the crater.
[5718.34s -> 5721.63s]  Then you skid and slide several feet down the rough slope.
[5722.26s -> 5724.26s]  Finally landing on what appears to be a path.
[5727.04s -> 5727.92s]  Check myself over.
[5728.48s -> 5732.35s]  You are uninjured, but there is no way back up.
[5732.35s -> 5734.11s]  A path leads down into the crater here.
[5734.11s -> 5737.39s]  Another trail leads north to south, around the rim.
[5737.39s -> 5740.08s]  It's cold.
[5740.08s -> 5745.31s]  The path down into the crater is wider and more beaten down than you might have expected.
[5745.87s -> 5750.35s]  This is not the main road to Mampang, but this trail must still see some use.
[5750.35s -> 5752.93s]  You would do well to find somewhere to rest safely.
[5756.96s -> 5761.06s]  Uh, okay.
[5762.08s -> 5764.40s]  This could be wildly different depending on which way we go.
[5764.40s -> 5766.16s]  Because this way is this little house.
[5766.98s -> 5768.50s]  This way is this house.
[5768.50s -> 5771.14s]  And this way is whatever this kind of chasm is here.
[5772.30s -> 5774.46s]  So, I'm going to let you guys choose for the first time.
[5775.26s -> 5778.54s]  Uh, are we going left, up, or right?
[5778.54s -> 5783.87s]  If there's a mod that is available, are we going to go left, up, or right?
[5795.06s -> 5803.70s]  I'm saying, I don't want to influence the poll.
[5804.34s -> 5810.05s]  Yeah, this is left, up, right.
[5810.05s -> 5813.94s]  Your voice just cracked?
[5814.94s -> 5815.66s]  It's going to.
[5816.30s -> 5821.41s]  When you go like this, when you go like this for two hours,
[5821.41s -> 5822.69s]  you're going to get a voice crack or two.
[5822.69s -> 5823.41s]  That's just the way it is.
[5823.97s -> 5832.88s]  Somebody just pushed their glasses up and said,
[5833.60s -> 5835.84s]  well, Jerma, that's not what happened.
[5836.72s -> 5838.48s]  You've only done that kind of voice.
[5838.48s -> 5839.76s]  You've been speaking normally.
[5840.40s -> 5844.08s]  You've only done voices for about 26 minutes total.
[5845.42s -> 5853.70s]  So, you're an idiot.
[5853.70s -> 5854.74s]  Why is it Squidward?
[5855.38s -> 5859.60s]  All right, where are we going?
[5864.21s -> 5865.73s]  And it looks like...
[5871.47s -> 5871.97s]  Let's go!
[5872.67s -> 5883.58s]  Why are you mocking your audience?
[5883.58s -> 5886.46s]  I wasn't mocking the audience.
[5886.46s -> 5891.18s]  I was mocking one person in the audience that I made up
[5891.18s -> 5895.15s]  to prove a point that doesn't really even matter.
[5895.71s -> 5903.49s]  Okay, you follow the trail until it becomes lost under thick scrub.
[5904.21s -> 5905.89s]  In the dark, you can no longer see the path.
[5906.53s -> 5910.66s]  This is a really bad place to go to sleep, but I kind of have to.
[5910.66s -> 5918.48s]  You try to lie down and curl up to sleep, but you are too exposed.
[5919.04s -> 5922.72s]  Anything flying overhead would see you in moments once the sun rises.
[5923.28s -> 5925.68s]  Better to find a place to sleep in the scrub.
[5925.68s -> 5927.47s]  You get back up to your feet.
[5927.47s -> 5936.35s]  Okay, well, I guess I'm going into the scrub.
[5936.35s -> 5938.91s]  You fight through the scrub that fills the crater basin.
[5939.47s -> 5941.47s]  In the darkness, you can see a little beyond your feet,
[5942.03s -> 5944.59s]  but there's plenty of cover you could sleep under.
[5946.19s -> 5948.85s]  Uh, yes, I need health.
[5949.41s -> 5950.29s]  Bad.
[5951.79s -> 5954.11s]  Setting down your pack, you try to stretch out despite the cold.
[5954.11s -> 5957.71s]  At least you've eaten already today, so you don't need to eat again to avoid hunger.
[5957.71s -> 5959.23s]  The more food will make you stronger.
[5959.23s -> 5960.19s]  I think I'm going to drink a potion.
[5960.19s -> 5961.31s]  This heals me more, right?
[5962.13s -> 5964.24s]  Yeah.
[5964.24s -> 5967.76s]  Unstoppering a vial of blimberry potion, you gulp down a mouthful.
[5968.40s -> 5971.60s]  You feel a little better, and all traces of hunger are soon gone.
[5972.53s -> 5974.53s]  And you lie back and try to forget your troubles.
[5979.49s -> 5982.93s]  You wake in the night to see a black shadow slipping into the gloom beside you.
[5983.49s -> 5995.25s]  You open your arms to gather starlight, and a voice laughs quietly.
[5995.25s -> 6000.64s]  Two hands clasp yours and separate them.
[6000.64s -> 6003.65s]  No need for that, Anor Londo.
[6003.65s -> 6006.05s]  The shape slips down onto the ground beside you.
[6007.38s -> 6008.42s]  Make space for him.
[6009.98s -> 6013.57s]  You make a space for him close by your side.
[6013.57s -> 6016.45s]  It is a cold night, here in the shadow of evil.
[6017.09s -> 6018.47s]  Flanker!
[6019.41s -> 6019.91s]  Flanker?
[6020.53s -> 6024.82s]  I near the end of my journey has you near the end of yours.
[6025.54s -> 6028.90s]  But, Anor Londo, I fear the outcome.
[6032.51s -> 6034.54s]  What do you fear?
[6034.54s -> 6036.30s]  We have traveled a long road together.
[6036.86s -> 6038.06s]  Soon we must separate.
[6041.33s -> 6042.29s]  I am not afraid.
[6043.47s -> 6044.59s]  I cannot know fear.
[6045.15s -> 6046.99s]  I am a dead man still alive.
[6047.63s -> 6050.75s]  An assassin is not permitted to experience mercy.
[6050.75s -> 6052.66s]  And yet, here I am.
[6053.22s -> 6059.84s]  Will you murder me in the dark?
[6061.15s -> 6062.91s]  I am glad of your company.
[6062.91s -> 6064.37s]  And I of yours.
[6064.93s -> 6070.38s]  The assassin is close enough to you for you to feel the movement as his powerful body relaxes.
[6070.38s -> 6072.56s]  Wait, what?
[6072.56s -> 6075.57s]  Is like air coming out of him?
[6076.58s -> 6077.08s]  Like...
[6077.94s -> 6083.97s]  One of us will kill the Archmage.
[6085.89s -> 6086.45s]  Perhaps.
[6087.17s -> 6088.77s]  Certainly someone will die.
[6089.49s -> 6092.61s]  He touches your shoulder briefly.
[6092.61s -> 6093.65s]  Rest now.
[6093.65s -> 6098.96s]  And so the night passes.
[6098.96s -> 6101.12s]  But you know that in the morning he will be gone.
[6113.81s -> 6115.01s]  You fucked up.
[6120.26s -> 6127.62s]  You fucked up.
[6127.62s -> 6128.42s]  You fucked up.
[6129.06s -> 6129.70s]  What do you mean?
[6135.38s -> 6135.94s]  You didn't...
[6136.90s -> 6138.18s]  We wanted to kiss him.
[6138.82s -> 6139.95s]  I don't know if that's an option.
[6142.27s -> 6142.83s]  Rewind?
[6150.29s -> 6151.01s]  We don't...
[6152.30s -> 6153.50s]  Rewind to Flanker.
[6153.50s -> 6154.86s]  Rewind to Flanker.
[6154.86s -> 6155.26s]  Franker?
[6157.26s -> 6157.90s]  Franker.
[6158.54s -> 6159.50s]  Oh yeah, don't worry.
[6159.50s -> 6161.50s]  Me and Franker, we'll see.
[6161.50s -> 6163.42s]  That's not the last time you're gonna see Flanker.
[6163.42s -> 6164.06s]  Rewind?
[6164.06s -> 6164.56s]  Wait.
[6164.94s -> 6165.90s]  Hold on.
[6165.90s -> 6167.34s]  Are you actually telling me to do this?
[6167.34s -> 6168.14s]  This is how it works?
[6168.70s -> 6169.34s]  I'm curious.
[6169.90s -> 6177.36s]  Okay.
[6177.92s -> 6187.35s]  Is there actually a romance option?
[6187.35s -> 6191.22s]  Okay.
[6193.27s -> 6196.55s]  Flanker, what do you fear?
[6198.02s -> 6199.64s]  I am not afraid.
[6199.64s -> 6200.36s]  Okay.
[6200.36s -> 6202.34s]  I'm glad for your company.
[6202.34s -> 6204.53s]  Can I ask you something?
[6204.53s -> 6205.25s]  Anything.
[6205.25s -> 6210.52s]  Will we survive this, do you think?
[6210.52s -> 6212.36s]  Is there someone waiting for you back home?
[6214.31s -> 6215.19s]  No one.
[6215.19s -> 6217.51s]  I am a ghost walking, after all.
[6217.51s -> 6223.40s]  After this, I may go where I wish.
[6223.40s -> 6231.30s]  Wherever you are invited, who would make a dark ghost welcome?
[6231.30s -> 6234.98s]  But as Flanker speaks, he breathes softly into the dark, very much alive.
[6235.54s -> 6236.90s]  Isaac got full health.
[6236.90s -> 6243.64s]  And so the night passes, but you know that in the morning he will be gone.
[6243.64s -> 6248.53s]  Isaac, I have 20 HP now.
[6248.53s -> 6249.33s]  Holy shit.
[6252.98s -> 6255.54s]  The sex option full-healed me.
[6257.80s -> 6259.88s]  But we don't know what that—that's what happened.
[6259.88s -> 6261.24s]  We may have just—who knows?
[6271.96s -> 6273.32s]  Sex full-heal.
[6274.52s -> 6282.20s]  I just want to hear, like, a Super Mario mushroom sound right now.
[6286.56s -> 6287.36s]  Okay.
[6287.36s -> 6288.48s]  Well, that's pretty awesome.
[6288.48s -> 6289.52s]  I have 20 fucking health.
[6289.52s -> 6290.16s]  I had four.
[6290.72s -> 6297.67s]  It is half-light when Flanker slips away.
[6297.67s -> 6300.95s]  You pick yourself to your feet and look around in the daylight.
[6300.95s -> 6305.36s]  A short distance ahead, you spy a large black bundle hanging from a tree.
[6305.36s -> 6307.54s]  Go look at it.
[6307.54s -> 6311.83s]  The bundle is long, at least six feet tall and jet black.
[6311.83s -> 6314.31s]  It sways slightly as it dangles from the branch.
[6314.31s -> 6317.27s]  As you get closer, you notice a chain running from the bundle to a stake in the ground.
[6317.27s -> 6319.43s]  You also notice the bundle is somewhat hairy.
[6319.43s -> 6343.38s]  Insulting the constellations above, you bind the spell, and a steady voice begins to speak to you.
[6343.46s -> 6347.06s]  The bat has a loud wail.
[6347.99s -> 6349.99s]  Loud enough to be heard in the Citadel.
[6351.14s -> 6352.02s]  Be careful!
[6353.94s -> 6358.39s]  Okay, I'm not fucking with that.
[6358.39s -> 6362.39s]  The chained bat has not yet stirred.
[6362.39s -> 6364.63s]  Perhaps you can slip past unnoticed.
[6365.81s -> 6366.31s]  Yeah.
[6367.59s -> 6370.31s]  Tightening your pack, you begin to creep past the creature.
[6370.95s -> 6373.65s]  It sleeps soundly as you pass the tree.
[6375.68s -> 6376.64s]  Near a tree.
[6376.64s -> 6382.32s]  But then the creature snorts,
[6383.36s -> 6386.56s]  distracting you for just a moment, and you step on a branch with a crack.
[6389.03s -> 6393.76s]  Wait, is this the part of the movie or TV show where we get to step on like five things,
[6393.76s -> 6395.84s]  and we get to hear over the course of a few minutes?
[6400.40s -> 6402.48s]  Or is he just going to get right up immediately?
[6402.48s -> 6408.02s]  Freeze.
[6408.02s -> 6413.30s]  You stop frozen to the spot, hand at the hilt of your assassin's sword.
[6413.30s -> 6420.28s]  The bat's head swivels this way and that, and then its beady eyes come to rest on yours.
[6421.97s -> 6423.09s]  Charge!
[6423.09s -> 6423.59s]  Cast spell.
[6431.70s -> 6432.50s]  I'm throwing a grenade.
[6433.22s -> 6437.44s]  You wind the stars into order around you.
[6437.44s -> 6442.48s]  Over the last of your pebbles, the superheated pebble lands right on the bat's nose.
[6442.48s -> 6445.04s]  It shrieks in pain, distracted and hurt.
[6448.55s -> 6449.99s]  Why did I not blow it up?
[6449.99s -> 6456.02s]  It didn't blow up.
[6456.02s -> 6456.82s]  Why was it a dud?
[6460.05s -> 6461.57s]  It's just really hot.
[6462.21s -> 6469.67s]  Why did it not explode?
[6469.67s -> 6471.03s]  Hold on a second.
[6471.03s -> 6472.55s]  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
[6472.55s -> 6473.75s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[6473.75s -> 6474.71s]  I'm sorry.
[6474.71s -> 6475.27s]  I'm sorry.
[6475.27s -> 6476.47s]  I'll keep the same thing going.
[6477.19s -> 6479.35s]  But I thought I was gonna blow up.
[6479.91s -> 6484.04s]  Well, that didn't work.
[6484.04s -> 6484.36s]  Okay.
[6485.16s -> 6489.04s]  Summon replica creature.
[6489.04s -> 6489.28s]  No.
[6489.92s -> 6496.55s]  There is a zip, which is teleport.
[6499.12s -> 6502.31s]  There is zen, which is hover.
[6506.68s -> 6508.04s]  There's also, yeah, this is zap.
[6509.32s -> 6510.36s]  Let me teleport.
[6510.36s -> 6511.88s]  I've never used a spell before, ever.
[6512.60s -> 6513.88s]  I'm gonna teleport.
[6513.88s -> 6520.12s]  You wind the stars into order around you, trusting to luck as the ring of green metal
[6520.12s -> 6522.84s]  on your finger begins to gleam like a serpent's eye.
[6522.84s -> 6525.32s]  You close your eyes as your body is wrenched away.
[6526.24s -> 6528.32s]  You reappear a fair distance away.
[6528.32s -> 6532.05s]  The bat flies at you, but it's halted by the chain.
[6532.05s -> 6536.07s]  Frustrated, it tugs at its bindings, which hold fast.
[6536.07s -> 6539.67s]  But now that it is unable to attack you, it remembers its mission.
[6540.23s -> 6544.45s]  It turns to call reinforcements, and you are too far to stop it.
[6544.45s -> 6547.99s]  Shit.
[6547.99s -> 6548.79s]  Shit, shit, shit.
[6548.79s -> 6549.35s]  One more.
[6549.35s -> 6550.07s]  I'm, one more.
[6550.71s -> 6551.75s]  Last one.
[6553.70s -> 6554.42s]  Okay.
[6554.42s -> 6555.54s]  Try to creep past.
[6556.10s -> 6563.27s]  You keep going, brazenly picking your way amongst the rocks, watching for more branches.
[6563.27s -> 6565.19s]  But it is too late, and the damage is done.
[6565.19s -> 6570.76s]  The beat of leathery wings comes from behind, and then two claws slice at your back.
[6570.76s -> 6572.92s]  You tumble to the ground, coughing with pain.
[6572.92s -> 6578.28s]  The bat lifts out of reach as though about to fly above the tree.
[6578.28s -> 6579.65s]  Stop it.
[6579.65s -> 6584.37s]  You stare at the chain, realizing suddenly that the bat isn't a captive or a guard.
[6584.93s -> 6589.09s]  It is a lookout, placed to warn the fortress of intruders in the crater.
[6589.09s -> 6594.77s]  Its high-pitched wail will be heard by the sensitive ears of the birdmen even miles away.
[6594.77s -> 6599.48s]  You have to stop it before it can call a horde down on you.
[6599.48s -> 6600.84s]  Yank the chain.
[6600.84s -> 6602.45s]  Throw the chakram.
[6602.45s -> 6604.69s]  Wait, what are the, any spells I can do now?
[6606.96s -> 6608.79s]  That I couldn't do before?
[6618.31s -> 6620.96s]  Okay.
[6620.96s -> 6621.46s]  Zap?
[6622.37s -> 6624.93s]  Zap might not kill it.
[6625.65s -> 6626.15s]  I'll try it.
[6633.91s -> 6634.71s]  Zap.
[6634.71s -> 6640.58s]  You wind the stars into order around you, building up a charge of electrical energy
[6640.58s -> 6641.38s]  around your palm.
[6642.02s -> 6644.18s]  Then you unleash it into the bat's body.
[6644.74s -> 6650.12s]  The creature jerks and smokes with energy before falling to the earth, a mere dark husk.
[6650.12s -> 6652.26s]  The trail runs in both directions.
[6652.26s -> 6653.06s]  I killed it!
[6653.06s -> 6657.70s]  Oh, it's connected to a chain.
[6657.70s -> 6660.50s]  Wouldn't that amplify the damage, probably?
[6660.50s -> 6661.14s]  That makes sense.
[6662.34s -> 6666.58s]  Metal?
[6666.58s -> 6667.38s]  All right.
[6667.38s -> 6668.88s]  Cool, good.
[6672.08s -> 6674.24s]  It is almost time for us to talk about a couple things.
[6674.88s -> 6676.71s]  I have a few things to talk about.
[6676.71s -> 6680.39s]  We've got, first of all, we've got grotto beasts to go over.
[6681.75s -> 6683.11s]  We also have the BLT to eat.
[6684.45s -> 6690.00s]  And there's also a piece of merch that's going to drop soon.
[6691.04s -> 6693.52s]  Unrelated to grotto beasts, this is a completely different thing.
[6694.61s -> 6695.49s]  And we can talk about it.
[6696.13s -> 6697.33s]  Some of you may already have seen it.
[6701.60s -> 6703.36s]  Oh my god, it's happening!
[6703.36s -> 6704.48s]  Don't, don't, hold on.
[6710.21s -> 6711.89s]  Is it your face mask?
[6712.85s -> 6713.35s]  No.
[6714.37s -> 6715.01s]  No, it is not.
[6721.86s -> 6725.06s]  Yeah, I got to sell that fucking mask of my face.
[6726.02s -> 6727.46s]  Incredibly detailed expan...
[6727.46s -> 6727.96s]  That's...
[6728.74s -> 6729.24s]  No.
[6731.67s -> 6734.47s]  But let's talk about a couple things.
[6734.47s -> 6736.39s]  Do you know what today is?
[6736.39s -> 6737.43s]  Does anybody know what today is?
[6738.58s -> 6739.78s]  We'll just do this in order.
[6739.78s -> 6740.74s]  Do you guys know what today is?
[6741.83s -> 6742.55s]  August what?
[6742.55s -> 6743.83s]  August 20...
[6743.83s -> 6744.55s]  What?
[6744.55s -> 6746.29s]  August 21st.
[6748.32s -> 6751.12s]  What is this, what is this the two-year anniversary of?
[6752.52s -> 6753.64s]  As of literally right now.
[6755.99s -> 6757.35s]  It's Sturr's birthday, obviously.
[6757.35s -> 6758.23s]  Happy birthday, Sturr.
[6758.23s -> 6759.59s]  But something else, something to do with me.
[6760.31s -> 6764.79s]  It is the exact two-year anniversary of the Dollhouse.
[6764.79s -> 6765.51s]  And baseball.
[6766.85s -> 6772.13s]  So, U2's is coming out with two vinyl figures.
[6773.01s -> 6775.09s]  One is a Dollhouse Jerma.
[6775.09s -> 6777.65s]  And one is a Umpire Elbertson Jerma.
[6781.36s -> 6783.68s]  So, to talk about this for a second.
[6784.40s -> 6789.04s]  There's a lot of people that came to the channel over the last couple of years.
[6790.10s -> 6793.67s]  That saw like clips of Dollhouse.
[6793.67s -> 6796.07s]  The channel grew a lot since Dollhouse.
[6797.38s -> 6802.21s]  And I've seen over the years, the last couple of years.
[6803.09s -> 6805.57s]  Like we had the Dollhouse shirts.
[6805.57s -> 6808.05s]  We had the posters for the Dollhouse.
[6808.69s -> 6813.41s]  But I feel like a lot of people have approached this channel because of Dollhouse.
[6814.95s -> 6820.02s]  So, if you've got a Reddit shelf at your house, maybe you'd want these two.
[6821.64s -> 6822.76s]  I can show them.
[6822.76s -> 6823.72s]  I'm going to show them.
[6824.36s -> 6828.84s]  You can take a look.
[6831.06s -> 6833.22s]  You can get it on your Reddit shelf.
[6833.78s -> 6837.22s]  Heh, heh, heh.
[6837.22s -> 6838.66s]  That's what brought me in.
[6838.66s -> 6839.16s]  Yeah.
[6840.29s -> 6842.37s]  So, I figured, okay.
[6842.37s -> 6843.49s]  That like makes sense to me.
[6844.21s -> 6847.36s]  Give people an opportunity to get it if they want.
[6848.00s -> 6850.69s]  Is it wearable?
[6850.69s -> 6851.81s]  It is a figurine.
[6852.84s -> 6853.88s]  They're vinyl figurines.
[6855.86s -> 6856.58s]  They're toys.
[6858.37s -> 6861.09s]  Jerma has gotten into toys.
[6868.96s -> 6870.24s]  All right, let me go back.
[6871.33s -> 6872.85s]  Um, let me get my...
[6873.73s -> 6874.85s]  Let me go pee.
[6874.85s -> 6875.73s]  Let me take a B or B.
[6875.73s -> 6877.41s]  Because I have Grotto B stuff to talk about.
[6877.41s -> 6878.93s]  And I have to get the fucking BLT up here.
[6884.24s -> 6885.36s]  They're action figures!
[6885.36s -> 6887.22s]  Heh, heh, heh.
[6887.22s -> 6887.70s]  Show them.
[6887.70s -> 6889.22s]  I'm, I'm, I'm telling you.
[6889.22s -> 6890.10s]  I gotta give you the plan.
[6890.74s -> 6894.00s]  Should I eat the BLT while I do this?
[6905.83s -> 6907.83s]  Where is the Catboy figurine?
[6908.63s -> 6910.55s]  That, that, that's not getting sold.
[6911.94s -> 6912.82s]  All right, be right back.
[6912.82s -> 6913.54s]  We'll talk about it.
[6914.10s -> 6915.94s]  Then we'll talk about Grotto Beasts.
[6915.94s -> 6918.21s]  A lot of stuff to go over.
[6918.21s -> 6919.25s]  I'll be right back.
[6919.25s -> 7022.88s]  Do this thing.
[7022.88s -> 7024.32s]  Did I miss the BLT?
[7024.32s -> 7025.12s]  No, you didn't.
[7025.12s -> 7029.65s]  I got it right here.
[7029.65s -> 7035.30s]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, this thing looks good!
[7035.30s -> 7036.58s]  It's just a regular BLT.
[7036.58s -> 7037.06s]  This, okay.
[7039.54s -> 7041.22s]  People, I don't know what you're expecting.
[7041.22s -> 7044.20s]  Do you have to eat it on face cam?
[7044.20s -> 7045.80s]  I am gonna eat this on face cam.
[7045.80s -> 7048.79s]  But I'm not gonna eat it fucking weirdly.
[7048.79s -> 7051.48s]  Okay?
[7051.48s -> 7053.64s]  I'm gonna just take normal bites.
[7053.64s -> 7055.16s]  I'm not gonna eat this weirdly.
[7055.16s -> 7058.15s]  I'm gonna, I'm not gonna,
[7058.15s -> 7059.83s]  I'm gonna eat it in like a side profile.
[7059.83s -> 7061.67s]  I'm not gonna look at the camera either.
[7061.67s -> 7062.55s]  You understand?
[7062.55s -> 7067.41s]  All right, I'm gonna give you the review.
[7067.41s -> 7073.83s]  But first I have to be...
[7074.55s -> 7075.83s]  I'm gonna jump scare you, by the way.
[7075.83s -> 7076.79s]  I'm about to be on camera.
[7081.24s -> 7081.96s]  You ready?
[7081.96s -> 7087.00s]  That's, that scared me and I knew it was happening.
[7087.00s -> 7088.47s]  Okay.
[7088.47s -> 7090.13s]  So, here we go.
[7090.13s -> 7091.49s]  I'm so grainy.
[7092.05s -> 7093.20s]  Here you go.
[7093.20s -> 7095.52s]  You ready?
[7095.52s -> 7095.76s]  All right.
[7095.76s -> 7096.80s]  So let's, hold on.
[7096.80s -> 7097.36s]  How do you feel?
[7097.36s -> 7100.44s]  Ready?
[7100.44s -> 7102.28s]  Umpire Albertson.
[7102.28s -> 7106.61s]  Pretty cool.
[7106.61s -> 7109.72s]  And BLT, let's go!
[7114.93s -> 7115.73s]  Yeah!
[7115.73s -> 7125.36s]  That's good.
[7125.36s -> 7129.14s]  Hold on, hold on.
[7129.14s -> 7133.49s]  What about Dollhouse Jerma?
[7133.49s -> 7133.97s]  Hmm?
[7133.97s -> 7135.28s]  What do you think of that?
[7135.28s -> 7139.86s]  Take a look at this.
[7139.86s -> 7140.98s]  This shit's real.
[7140.98s -> 7142.66s]  This is a real fucking toy.
[7142.66s -> 7146.71s]  Let me open it.
[7146.71s -> 7147.35s]  Is it crispy?
[7148.15s -> 7154.52s]  Sorry about the wicked grainy footage.
[7154.52s -> 7157.60s]  BLTs are so good.
[7157.60s -> 7158.72s]  Just hits every note.
[7158.72s -> 7162.24s]  All right, hold on.
[7162.24s -> 7163.04s]  Here we go.
[7163.04s -> 7164.32s]  You guys ready for the reveal?
[7164.32s -> 7170.29s]  Let me get it out.
[7170.29s -> 7173.48s]  There's stuff on the, on the package too.
[7173.48s -> 7175.94s]  Can I see?
[7175.94s -> 7176.42s]  Yep.
[7176.42s -> 7180.02s]  I was gonna say, warning.
[7180.02s -> 7184.05s]  This is an adult collectible.
[7184.69s -> 7185.73s]  Not a toy.
[7185.73s -> 7193.86s]  I just may have called it a toy a lot.
[7193.86s -> 7198.15s]  Let me take this out.
[7198.15s -> 7207.16s]  So there, there's an image of me from Dollhouse.
[7207.16s -> 7209.51s]  Which is the two-year anniversary of Dollhouse.
[7209.51s -> 7211.81s]  I don't want to be loud.
[7211.81s -> 7219.44s]  Let me get it out of the package.
[7219.44s -> 7224.42s]  There's a picture of me leaning against a door.
[7224.42s -> 7229.72s]  And that is the image that the people at U2s used for this.
[7230.28s -> 7233.40s]  See, it's like that.
[7234.42s -> 7235.14s]  Let me get you a good view.
[7239.16s -> 7240.68s]  It comes with the door.
[7240.68s -> 7243.67s]  And it does come with the door.
[7243.67s -> 7245.73s]  There's that one.
[7245.73s -> 7246.77s]  You can sit.
[7247.41s -> 7249.73s]  It could be like a little, maybe like a little bookshelf.
[7249.73s -> 7250.45s]  Your Reddit shelf.
[7251.01s -> 7253.40s]  Bookcase.
[7253.40s -> 7256.26s]  You know, pretty neat.
[7256.26s -> 7259.73s]  Let's do the umpire.
[7259.73s -> 7264.23s]  So I got this one here.
[7264.23s -> 7265.43s]  Wait, what's on the back?
[7265.43s -> 7272.47s]  Say this.
[7272.47s -> 7273.83s]  Can you detach the door?
[7273.83s -> 7274.87s]  That's a good question.
[7274.87s -> 7275.75s]  I don't know.
[7276.88s -> 7278.64s]  I don't believe so.
[7278.64s -> 7280.96s]  I mean, you probably could.
[7282.24s -> 7285.76s]  If you really, if you really wanted to.
[7285.76s -> 7286.08s]  I don't know.
[7286.80s -> 7288.72s]  That might not be covered under warranty.
[7288.72s -> 7290.00s]  Let's just put it that way.
[7290.00s -> 7290.88s]  Like there even is one.
[7290.88s -> 7291.28s]  I don't know.
[7291.92s -> 7294.24s]  But I don't think that that would, that would probably break it.
[7298.60s -> 7299.32s]  Warranty.
[7301.60s -> 7304.08s]  It's not a fucking laptop.
[7304.08s -> 7305.76s]  Like, what am I talking about?
[7305.76s -> 7312.05s]  I just don't want to be loud.
[7312.05s -> 7319.25s]  So this is from the umpire, which also was August 18th.
[7319.25s -> 7321.97s]  So this is kind of doubling them up a little here.
[7322.61s -> 7324.29s]  My God, I almost broke it.
[7325.09s -> 7325.65s]  Here's this one.
[7328.00s -> 7329.36s]  You got the square there.
[7329.92s -> 7330.80s]  Accurate mustache.
[7331.44s -> 7332.90s]  Got this thing here too.
[7333.70s -> 7335.14s]  They stand on their own.
[7335.86s -> 7336.82s]  So they do stand up.
[7339.75s -> 7340.47s]  There I am.
[7340.47s -> 7342.79s]  Very, I'm very upset about that last call.
[7343.51s -> 7346.42s]  Oh yeah.
[7348.87s -> 7349.37s]  You twos.
[7350.40s -> 7352.24s]  These are not available right now.
[7353.84s -> 7357.84s]  These are available on the 28th of August.
[7357.84s -> 7358.56s]  So next week.
[7359.28s -> 7362.48s]  Look at that fucking mustache.
[7362.48s -> 7363.92s]  Look at how good that looks.
[7363.92s -> 7367.12s]  That accurate mustache that didn't have to get filled in
[7367.12s -> 7368.48s]  by a professional makeup artist.
[7369.20s -> 7372.44s]  The box has some cool art stuff on it too.
[7373.16s -> 7373.72s]  Like in here.
[7376.74s -> 7377.14s]  Inside.
[7377.14s -> 7378.10s]  I don't know if you can see inside.
[7378.74s -> 7379.92s]  I don't want to break the box.
[7379.92s -> 7380.64s]  This is the only one I have.
[7380.64s -> 7381.44s]  This is the only one I have.
[7382.16s -> 7382.90s]  Here and there.
[7382.90s -> 7384.82s]  You can see the logo.
[7386.96s -> 7391.91s]  And you saw the back of it before.
[7391.91s -> 7392.95s]  What's on the inside of the other one?
[7393.59s -> 7400.87s]  Who's that?
[7400.87s -> 7402.76s]  There he is.
[7403.40s -> 7409.41s]  But if you want to get them, they are available on the 28th.
[7409.41s -> 7417.78s]  They will go on sale on I believe 12 p.m pacific is when it's going to be available.
[7422.64s -> 7426.45s]  Oh, no way.
[7426.45s -> 7426.85s]  No way.
[7426.85s -> 7427.41s]  You know what I mean?
[7427.41s -> 7428.53s]  Like no fucking way.
[7428.53s -> 7429.25s]  Is that going to happen?
[7439.04s -> 7440.32s]  It's a sandwich.
[7440.32s -> 7441.28s]  It's a sandwich.
[7441.28s -> 7442.00s]  Everybody chill.
[7442.56s -> 7448.40s]  This is really good.
[7448.40s -> 7449.75s]  You want to get a good look at this?
[7449.75s -> 7451.03s]  Okay, so this is a BLT.
[7451.83s -> 7453.91s]  Let me open up the box of the BLT came in.
[7453.91s -> 7454.55s]  Okay, here we go.
[7455.27s -> 7457.32s]  As you see here.
[7458.04s -> 7459.99s]  So yeah, get a look at that.
[7460.55s -> 7462.95s]  Pretty good.
[7463.49s -> 7467.96s]  Pretty good tomato ratio there.
[7472.05s -> 7475.01s]  These are available in your house.
[7475.65s -> 7476.61s]  You just make it.
[7478.69s -> 7479.89s]  That was way too 3d.
[7480.45s -> 7487.67s]  I eat like a fucking weirdo.
[7488.23s -> 7490.15s]  When I know people, this is why I don't eat on screen.
[7495.14s -> 7496.58s]  When people are watching me eat.
[7497.14s -> 7498.82s]  I know that a lot of you can agree with this.
[7499.38s -> 7500.92s]  When anytime somebody watches me eat.
[7501.56s -> 7507.32s]  I immediately start thinking of every single chew, every single bite, every single what's
[7507.32s -> 7509.16s]  always something on my face, something on my nose.
[7509.96s -> 7515.33s]  I just want to be like in my own private room when I eat.
[7515.97s -> 7518.92s]  Let's get it.
[7518.92s -> 7520.12s]  Let's get a taste of that tomato.
[7526.13s -> 7527.17s]  Actually, I'm glad I'm eating this.
[7527.73s -> 7530.53s]  But yeah, um, those are the you chooses.
[7532.60s -> 7537.16s]  It's uh, I believe I don't want to get the price wrong, but I think they're 29.
[7537.16s -> 7537.66s]  99.
[7538.36s -> 7541.16s]  Go to him over time.
[7541.16s -> 7541.48s]  Look at him.
[7541.48s -> 7542.28s]  I'm going to get them together.
[7542.92s -> 7546.02s]  Here you go.
[7546.48s -> 7548.44s]  There they are.
[7548.44s -> 7549.62s]  One and two.
[7550.18s -> 7552.84s]  Hey, what's that?
[7552.84s -> 7554.12s]  Hey, you're out.
[7554.12s -> 7554.92s]  I'm not out.
[7554.92s -> 7555.96s]  I'll just call the bear.
[7556.60s -> 7557.96s]  No, that's a foul ball.
[7559.84s -> 7561.84s]  You know, you could do that.
[7573.54s -> 7574.18s]  They're fighting.
[7575.38s -> 7575.54s]  No.
[7575.54s -> 7576.58s]  What about the warranty?
[7576.58s -> 7578.98s]  Yeah, there's no, I don't, I don't think there's a warranty.
[7579.62s -> 7581.14s]  I don't think there's a warranty.
[7581.14s -> 7583.86s]  I said that just because I was talking nonsense.
[7584.50s -> 7585.00s]  Oh, yeah.
[7588.87s -> 7593.99s]  Anyways, let's talk about what that is means.
[7595.16s -> 7596.92s]  Um, I want to make this pretty clear.
[7598.15s -> 7599.27s]  Doing something like this.
[7599.91s -> 7602.12s]  Hey, dude, dollhouse was two years ago.
[7602.12s -> 7605.88s]  The umpire, the baseball association stream was a year ago.
[7606.20s -> 7607.00s]  Why are you doing this now?
[7608.15s -> 7614.88s]  And I think one of the things to really just give you is I think this is probably one of
[7614.88s -> 7617.84s]  the last pieces of merch I'm ever going to do.
[7620.31s -> 7621.19s]  Grotto beasts.
[7621.83s -> 7627.14s]  We still are thinking of maybe some stuff we're thinking of.
[7627.14s -> 7632.42s]  It's possible to do some more with Grotto beasts, but just like Jerma merch, like German
[7632.42s -> 7633.54s]  nine, eight, five merch.
[7634.71s -> 7641.99s]  I don't, I don't know if I have much more plans to do any more me merch.
[7641.99s -> 7643.03s]  If that doesn't make any sense.
[7647.25s -> 7648.93s]  The old man is done.
[7648.93s -> 7650.37s]  No, I am not far from it.
[7650.93s -> 7658.32s]  I talked a little bit in pre stream today and in the discord, but we don't have to get
[7658.32s -> 7659.60s]  too far into it.
[7659.60s -> 7666.20s]  It's just the one thing is it's kind of like memorabilia for me at some point, too.
[7667.00s -> 7668.28s]  It's like, hey, the dollhouse stream.
[7668.28s -> 7670.12s]  That's like one of my favorite things I've ever done.
[7670.12s -> 7671.96s]  The baseball stream is one of my favorite things I've ever done.
[7673.16s -> 7675.83s]  And I just, I don't know.
[7675.83s -> 7680.15s]  It's a nice way to, I think, to solidify that it existed for me as well as obviously
[7680.15s -> 7681.03s]  the streams existing.
[7681.03s -> 7686.07s]  But I, these can go on my, you know, jokeyly, these can go on my Reddit shelf and I can
[7686.07s -> 7689.75s]  like look at them and be like, oh yeah, that was, that was the thing that I did.
[7694.93s -> 7698.85s]  But personal merch, this is probably one of the, one of the last ones.
[7699.57s -> 7705.16s]  And I did say Grotto beasts because we're going to talk about Grotto beasts because
[7705.16s -> 7707.24s]  I want to show you a couple of really interesting things, too.
[7707.80s -> 7711.08s]  But again, August 28th, those are going to go on sale 12 p.m.
[7711.08s -> 7711.64s]  Pacific.
[7712.20s -> 7714.92s]  I believe they're only going to be available for a limited time.
[7714.92s -> 7718.20s]  This is not going to be like Grotto beast where it's like a presale and then like we
[7718.20s -> 7720.44s]  do another thing and another thing and you can still buy it.
[7720.44s -> 7723.24s]  I'm pretty sure these are only going to be available for a couple, a few weeks.
[7724.55s -> 7732.12s]  So as of August 28th, you'll have all through pretty much most of September.
[7736.28s -> 7738.36s]  But anyways, really cool.
[7739.70s -> 7740.98s]  Dude, talk faster.
[7743.72s -> 7745.40s]  I want to show you something else.
[7745.96s -> 7752.93s]  So Grotto beast tabletop simulator, the digital version is something we've been
[7753.57s -> 7755.59s]  kind of talking about, working on.
[7756.23s -> 7761.32s]  Those of you that have been following that project, the physical version was a great
[7761.32s -> 7762.20s]  success.
[7762.20s -> 7764.44s]  It's, I'm really happy with it.
[7764.44s -> 7766.04s]  All the core team is really happy with it.
[7768.28s -> 7771.72s]  Barring a few bumps along the road, like we knew it was possible.
[7772.88s -> 7778.80s]  I want to show you now the progress on the digital tabletop simulator mod that will be
[7778.80s -> 7779.36s]  for free.
[7780.96s -> 7785.86s]  So this is the first image that you are going to see.
[7787.92s -> 7793.76s]  Here is the Grotto beast tabletop simulator mod that is currently in development right
[7793.76s -> 7794.40s]  now.
[7794.40s -> 7796.87s]  It's very, very soon to come out.
[7797.51s -> 7802.71s]  You will see it soon, very soon judging by what the image I'm going to show you today.
[7804.42s -> 7806.42s]  This has all of the cards.
[7808.60s -> 7810.68s]  You can make pretty much any deck you want.
[7811.24s -> 7813.72s]  There's a lot of interesting scripting that went into this.
[7814.96s -> 7818.16s]  Here is the table, which is the rumble ring, the wrestling ring.
[7819.51s -> 7821.19s]  Again, all this is all free.
[7821.19s -> 7822.63s]  Anybody that wants to play it.
[7822.63s -> 7828.72s]  We want to have a good way for people to go and actually hang out and play versus, um,
[7828.72s -> 7830.80s]  how the fuck are we going to play a physical card game together?
[7831.68s -> 7838.63s]  And the card game portion was something that was built on top of the merch portion, right?
[7838.63s -> 7839.83s]  Because it was, it was merch.
[7839.83s -> 7842.71s]  It was supposed to be merch, but we had an awesome game designer.
[7842.71s -> 7844.47s]  We had an awesome game built on top of it.
[7845.11s -> 7850.64s]  So here's where you can play it and have it be supported pretty much in perpetuity here.
[7851.20s -> 7853.17s]  Get some more images.
[7854.05s -> 7856.93s]  There's going to be a deck building portion of this.
[7857.57s -> 7859.12s]  You'll be able to craft a deck.
[7860.45s -> 7862.05s]  We have all kinds of plans for this.
[7867.28s -> 7874.15s]  Get your, you make your, your, your entire deck, but not just deck building and deck
[7874.15s -> 7876.87s]  crafting, but let's get a big view.
[7877.51s -> 7879.62s]  Look at how cool this is.
[7880.18s -> 7886.37s]  Isn't it beautiful?
[7889.11s -> 7893.67s]  I told you when I said we were really, I wanted to put some money into it, some time into it,
[7893.67s -> 7895.35s]  actually have people working on it.
[7896.31s -> 7897.59s]  I meant it and we meant that.
[7897.59s -> 7900.55s]  So it's, uh, it's going to be a fun experience.
[7900.55s -> 7901.83s]  It's not just going to be a card game.
[7901.83s -> 7903.19s]  There's going to be other stuff here too.
[7903.99s -> 7906.47s]  You're probably noticing there's like a treasure chest over there.
[7906.47s -> 7907.83s]  What's that stuff on the table?
[7907.83s -> 7908.87s]  What is that cauldron?
[7909.76s -> 7913.11s]  There's a lot of stuff that we're going to put in.
[7914.28s -> 7914.78s]  Toys.
[7915.40s -> 7920.23s]  There's going to be lots of little fun activities.
[7920.95s -> 7923.00s]  It's just all free.
[7923.56s -> 7925.24s]  None of this is going to cost any money at all.
[7925.24s -> 7930.24s]  You have to own tabletop simulator as the, that's the only thing you have to have.
[7931.88s -> 7937.00s]  If you have tabletop simulator, any of the patches, any of the updates, any of this,
[7937.00s -> 7939.08s]  you will have for free forever.
[7939.80s -> 7942.44s]  So there's not going to be a cost entry for this.
[7943.08s -> 7946.68s]  So there's the treasure chest.
[7947.32s -> 7949.64s]  What's in the treasure chest?
[7950.28s -> 7955.72s]  Well, you'll have to find out because we can't just tell you everything.
[7963.88s -> 7965.88s]  I, Ooh, what's that in the top left corner?
[7966.44s -> 7968.63s]  You see the end turn button?
[7969.27s -> 7971.03s]  So this tracks a lot of stuff.
[7972.74s -> 7979.48s]  The, the devs that have been working on this, I've put a lot of time into it.
[7980.28s -> 7982.20s]  And it's going to be very fleshed out.
[7983.00s -> 7985.72s]  What I've seen of it so far has been two thumbs up.
[7986.36s -> 7991.51s]  Can I have an arcade?
[7991.51s -> 7991.83s]  Come on.
[7991.83s -> 7992.55s]  You didn't even see that.
[7993.27s -> 7995.24s]  This is all work in progress.
[7995.24s -> 7998.28s]  By the way, this will be, things are probably going to change.
[7998.28s -> 8004.04s]  Things will probably move around a little, but there, there's like the little toy section
[8004.04s -> 8012.74s]  potentially, a little arcade section, space to move around, walk around.
[8013.30s -> 8018.96s]  Somebody said, I'm so sorry for whatever I did to get timed out.
[8018.96s -> 8020.40s]  Well, at least you're apologizing for it.
[8022.47s -> 8028.05s]  Is this going to be on steam?
[8028.69s -> 8034.21s]  This is going to just be a free tabletop simulator mod.
[8035.67s -> 8037.75s]  You have to own tabletop simulator.
[8037.75s -> 8041.35s]  Tabletop simulator goes on sale all the time if you don't have it.
[8042.15s -> 8047.84s]  But what is, how much is tabletop right now?
[8048.40s -> 8055.51s]  Is it 20 bucks right now?
[8056.31s -> 8063.11s]  Tabletop goes on sale at least a few times a year or sometimes up 10, five, 10 bucks.
[8063.11s -> 8073.96s]  Usually I'm seeing some, some really interesting comments here, but like what to do with this.
[8074.60s -> 8079.68s]  Instead of just in tabletop simulator, like I said, a couple of months ago, when we first
[8079.68s -> 8085.60s]  were really talking about this, let, let's get this one out first and then we can figure it out.
[8089.73s -> 8089.89s]  Yeah.
[8089.89s -> 8090.61s]  I'll scroll through them again.
[8090.61s -> 8101.36s]  So you can say mobile game, Andy.
[8102.16s -> 8106.36s]  I don't think tabletop is tabletop simulator on iOS.
[8113.59s -> 8118.69s]  Well, I, I wanted to, when we first were talking about doing this, I was like, you know, I want
[8118.69s -> 8122.63s]  to be able to have people like walk around and look at stuff and pick up stuff and throw it
[8122.63s -> 8124.79s]  around and go into the, go to the cauldron and look at it.
[8124.79s -> 8128.24s]  And I want it just to be more than just playing the cards.
[8128.80s -> 8134.07s]  How come you're not playing sorcery?
[8134.07s -> 8135.19s]  Well, we got to talk about some stuff.
[8135.75s -> 8143.28s]  Tabletop also has VR.
[8144.10s -> 8144.82s]  Oh, that's cool.
[8145.46s -> 8150.47s]  And again, it's just a tabletop mod.
[8151.03s -> 8152.23s]  It's not a paid anything.
[8152.23s -> 8154.79s]  It's just the project did really well.
[8155.67s -> 8160.79s]  And I would like to see it be supported and have people be able to actually play it and not have
[8160.79s -> 8164.31s]  to worry about how or where or why, or how am I going to do that?
[8164.31s -> 8170.34s]  If you've got a buddy that wants to play with you, then you can.
[8170.34s -> 8172.26s]  And it's all every, all the cards are here.
[8172.82s -> 8175.99s]  You do not collect them.
[8175.99s -> 8177.03s]  You don't earn them.
[8177.03s -> 8177.91s]  They're just available.
[8178.47s -> 8185.91s]  But that's what I wanted to show today.
[8186.55s -> 8190.64s]  And again, the YouTube stuff, that is the 28th.
[8191.20s -> 8193.28s]  There's no release date on this yet.
[8193.84s -> 8197.65s]  This is kind of just like, hey, it's really close.
[8198.37s -> 8204.29s]  So prepare for a lot of stuff in the GB chat and talking about it and how we're going to
[8205.01s -> 8207.25s]  release it out there and what the plan is.
[8207.25s -> 8208.37s]  It's happening very soon.
[8212.16s -> 8212.40s]  Yeah.
[8213.04s -> 8217.59s]  We can now go back to me taking another couple of bites of my BLT.
[8218.47s -> 8226.85s]  I'm going to eat this off camera.
[8228.50s -> 8231.06s]  I can't believe I got the fucking sauce on my face.
[8232.36s -> 8232.68s]  Great.
[8236.71s -> 8236.95s]  Yeah.
[8236.95s -> 8237.19s]  Thanks.
[8237.19s -> 8238.79s]  You two's for even considering it.
[8240.00s -> 8244.00s]  Thanks all of you for supporting this channel for the fucking decade plus.
[8245.81s -> 8249.88s]  We're going to be like kind of a nice little, hey, it's dollhouse stuff.
[8250.44s -> 8251.00s]  Remember that?
[8255.81s -> 8256.05s]  Okay.
[8256.61s -> 8260.40s]  I'll take one more bite on camera and then I'm going to do the rest off camera.
[8261.04s -> 8266.47s]  It's actually really good.
[8268.16s -> 8268.96s]  See the toasted bread.
[8269.68s -> 8274.18s]  You don't, well, you don't think I had the bread completely.
[8274.18s -> 8275.30s]  I don't think the bread is toasted.
[8275.94s -> 8279.06s]  What are you on about?
[8279.62s -> 8307.80s]  Somebody said, dude, you just, you just Minecraft ate that.
[8309.91s -> 8310.95s]  You add sound effects.
[8310.95s -> 8312.39s]  You got to get sound effects on that.
[8312.39s -> 8312.87s]  You're going to get.
[8315.11s -> 8328.98s]  How is your camera from 2001?
[8330.29s -> 8331.01s]  I don't care.
[8331.65s -> 8335.35s]  Oh my God.
[8335.35s -> 8336.61s]  Okay.
[8336.61s -> 8337.57s]  All right.
[8337.57s -> 8339.03s]  I'm going to slowly eat the rest of this.
[8340.16s -> 8344.40s]  Give me one more second while I put this, some of this, these figurines away.
[8347.68s -> 8349.04s]  Very exciting stuff.
[8350.72s -> 8352.13s]  I'll see you guys in like two minutes.
[8354.63s -> 8608.29s]  I'm being reminded that I put BLT in D tier.
[8608.29s -> 8608.53s]  Yeah.
[8608.53s -> 8610.58s]  Well, I'm kind of full of shit.
[8610.58s -> 8612.10s]  I think you've probably figured that out over the years.
[8615.48s -> 8625.38s]  Hey, can I take the door off?
[8625.38s -> 8629.22s]  Oh, I'm going to, I got a hiccup because I got it like two hiccups off stream,
[8629.22s -> 8630.18s]  but I'm going to pull this one.
[8637.80s -> 8638.04s]  Yeah.
[8638.04s -> 8642.76s]  The, I, all jokes aside, I, I don't think there's a fucking warranty on these.
[8642.76s -> 8643.32s]  I don't know.
[8643.32s -> 8644.36s]  You have to look at the terms.
[8646.21s -> 8648.93s]  I'm not going to say that and be completely wrong.
[8648.93s -> 8650.93s]  I did some, it's a, it's an adult figurine.
[8657.11s -> 8670.34s]  Oh, um, I, I can't laugh like that.
[8670.34s -> 8671.14s]  God damn it.
[8671.94s -> 8672.18s]  Okay.
[8676.12s -> 8683.33s]  Uh, you can't retire yet.
[8683.33s -> 8687.75s]  Somebody said, we'll talk about that when I need to.
[8689.22s -> 8689.62s]  Jess?
[8689.62s -> 8691.62s]  No, still here.
[8692.87s -> 8693.59s]  Still here.
[8695.70s -> 8697.62s]  Uh, we're not gonna, we're not talking about that right now.
[8697.62s -> 8702.26s]  He's going to have to talk.
[8702.26s -> 8703.70s]  No, we're not talking about that right now.
[8705.35s -> 8708.31s]  If you really want to know what we talked about in pre-stream,
[8708.95s -> 8713.88s]  it's, uh, you can go look, but it's not something I really want to bring up right now.
[8713.88s -> 8722.07s]  Just know that there are plans in the short to medium term to eat another BLT on stream.
[8722.63s -> 8723.30s]  Okay.
[8724.10s -> 8727.65s]  All right.
[8727.65s -> 8729.09s]  What are we, uh, where are we going?
[8729.09s -> 8730.07s]  What are we doing?
[8730.71s -> 8733.01s]  Looks so good.
[8733.57s -> 8733.97s]  Look at that.
[8734.53s -> 8737.09s]  Where are we going?
[8739.92s -> 8741.68s]  Oh, you're not allowed to retire.
[8741.68s -> 8743.28s]  Well, that's for me to decide.
[8743.84s -> 8744.96s]  Okay.
[8745.60s -> 8746.87s]  Okay.
[8747.67s -> 8753.84s]  Do you want a tomato town?
[8754.00s -> 8756.90s]  No, that's mine.
[8756.90s -> 8768.44s]  I get to keep the two-handed lightning sword or the offhand orb that gives you 30% resistance
[8768.44s -> 8769.94s]  to fucking fire.
[8769.94s -> 8770.90s]  That's mine.
[8770.90s -> 8772.18s]  You're, you can't have it.
[8772.90s -> 8773.14s]  All right.
[8773.14s -> 8775.78s]  I want to go to the, I want to go in like this way.
[8776.74s -> 8783.25s]  Can you take a shit in this game?
[8784.13s -> 8791.48s]  Um, I think you actually might be able to, I could be wrong.
[8791.48s -> 8792.84s]  That's actually pretty possible.
[8793.40s -> 8793.88s]  Maybe.
[8794.52s -> 8794.76s]  Okay.
[8794.76s -> 8804.72s]  There is an unshakable gloom about this place.
[8804.72s -> 8813.19s]  A few birds are singing thin and miserable songs.
[8813.19s -> 8815.11s]  A thin plume of smoke rises to the east.
[8815.67s -> 8816.47s]  Look at the smoke.
[8817.03s -> 8823.00s]  From what you can make out, the smoke seems to be rising steadily, but thinly.
[8823.00s -> 8825.99s]  It is more like a mist than a smoke from a bonfire.
[8826.63s -> 8827.91s]  You slip onwards through the crater.
[8828.64s -> 8830.16s]  Can you use a neti pot in this game?
[8830.80s -> 8831.04s]  No.
[8832.20s -> 8832.44s]  All right.
[8832.44s -> 8835.57s]  I want to go to the, I'm going to the smoke.
[8836.13s -> 8837.25s]  I'm actually glad I ate that BLT.
[8837.25s -> 8841.06s]  I feel like way better.
[8843.01s -> 8843.17s]  Okay.
[8843.17s -> 8846.34s]  I'm going to go to the, I'm going to go to the smoke.
[8846.34s -> 8846.98s]  I'm actually glad I ate that BLT.
[8846.98s -> 8847.86s]  I feel like way better.
[8848.58s -> 8850.00s]  I hadn't eaten that much today.
[8850.64s -> 8856.16s]  You break from the trail and head across the loose dirt towards the rising smoke.
[8856.72s -> 8858.40s]  The air begins to get warm.
[8858.40s -> 8863.36s]  Sweat trickles down your back as you get closer to what appears to be a crack deep in the earth.
[8864.00s -> 8869.72s]  Approach the fissure.
[8870.60s -> 8872.60s]  You make your way carefully to the fissure's edge.
[8872.60s -> 8876.60s]  It is almost pleasantly warm here with soft moss underneath your feet.
[8877.24s -> 8881.24s]  Superheated steam bursts up every few minutes with a hiss.
[8882.12s -> 8884.28s]  There's something else on the air too.
[8884.28s -> 8885.40s]  The sounds of the wind.
[8885.40s -> 8887.32s]  Surely not voices.
[8887.96s -> 8895.51s]  What can I do here?
[8905.01s -> 8905.73s]  So it's hot.
[8909.12s -> 8911.92s]  Um, talk all languages.
[8911.92s -> 8913.36s]  Can I talk to the crater?
[8914.08s -> 8916.69s]  This is the easy thing to do.
[8923.38s -> 8923.70s]  Yeah.
[8924.52s -> 8925.08s]  Always suss.
[8926.04s -> 8927.64s]  Craft the spell.
[8927.64s -> 8929.40s]  A calm voice speaks into your thoughts.
[8930.88s -> 8932.16s]  There's little to fear here.
[8933.35s -> 8934.07s]  Echoes.
[8935.35s -> 8936.07s]  Nothing more.
[8938.44s -> 8939.48s]  I'll prove it to you.
[8946.71s -> 8947.21s]  Hello!
[8948.95s -> 8949.45s]  Hello!
[8953.36s -> 8956.28s]  See, I told you that's all that was here.
[8960.84s -> 8961.65s]  Okay.
[8961.65s -> 8963.89s]  The vent is a jagged crack in the earth.
[8964.53s -> 8966.53s]  The black stone is deeply cut.
[8967.09s -> 8970.69s]  Strange shapes flicker within the rising jets of steam, seemingly murmuring.
[8971.33s -> 8975.11s]  But whatever your spell says, you can definitely hear voices.
[8975.11s -> 8976.15s]  Where are they coming from?
[8980.69s -> 8983.56s]  Um, let's listen.
[8984.20s -> 8987.88s]  Straining to listen, you make out distinct voices coming from deep inside the vent.
[8988.44s -> 8992.68s]  It is like standing on a balcony above a room full of whispering people,
[8992.68s -> 8994.92s]  all crowding for attention at the edge of your hearing.
[8995.64s -> 8997.40s]  But how can anyone survive down here?
[8997.96s -> 9000.60s]  There are no creatures near the vent, despite the warmth it provides.
[9003.22s -> 9003.72s]  Oh, yeah.
[9006.58s -> 9009.80s]  I said, who's there?
[9009.80s -> 9010.44s]  You call out.
[9011.00s -> 9014.12s]  The voices become louder in response, crowding over each other.
[9014.12s -> 9016.12s]  They're speaking a language you do not recognize.
[9020.36s -> 9021.56s]  But there's nothing here.
[9024.24s -> 9024.80s]  Echoes.
[9027.60s -> 9030.23s]  Can I talk on languages?
[9031.67s -> 9037.46s]  Cause sleepiness.
[9038.18s -> 9045.44s]  Can I understand if I put this on?
[9046.00s -> 9051.17s]  Pulling out the green wig, you put it on and cast the spell.
[9051.73s -> 9057.89s]  The voices from the crater transform into a cacophony of overlapping curses, wails, and
[9057.89s -> 9058.53s]  complaints.
[9059.33s -> 9060.29s]  They're confused.
[9060.93s -> 9062.61s]  Many of them hardly make sense.
[9063.33s -> 9065.86s]  Okay.
[9065.86s -> 9066.90s]  Let me say, I'm going to speak to them.
[9067.46s -> 9069.70s]  You greet the voices and they respond with surprise.
[9070.34s -> 9072.10s]  Green shadows flicker near the vent.
[9076.88s -> 9077.92s]  You can hear us?
[9078.56s -> 9081.59s]  Can you see us as well?
[9082.47s -> 9083.51s]  Do we exist?
[9085.91s -> 9087.03s]  I do exist.
[9091.65s -> 9092.93s]  Yes, you lie.
[9092.93s -> 9095.67s]  The tension eases, but many still swirl and cry.
[9099.76s -> 9100.80s]  Who are you?
[9100.80s -> 9104.76s]  We are the dead of Agbad.
[9105.48s -> 9107.08s]  We lived in a village here.
[9107.88s -> 9108.92s]  It is lost.
[9109.64s -> 9112.37s]  A village?
[9112.93s -> 9113.43s]  Here?
[9114.05s -> 9116.98s]  The earth was not cracked when the village was built.
[9117.62s -> 9120.90s]  How did you die?
[9121.99s -> 9123.19s]  The earth opened.
[9123.19s -> 9125.67s]  Every house was lost into the fire.
[9126.39s -> 9128.71s]  This vent is all that is left.
[9128.71s -> 9130.23s]  And we are trapped.
[9130.23s -> 9132.31s]  The rock's pressing and heat burning.
[9134.88s -> 9136.56s]  I still feel it on my skin.
[9137.36s -> 9142.02s]  Can I aid you?
[9142.02s -> 9144.10s]  How can one aid the dead?
[9144.90s -> 9146.66s]  Put out the fire!
[9147.38s -> 9148.90s]  Are you not the Anor Lander?
[9149.62s -> 9151.00s]  Who's that?
[9155.91s -> 9157.19s]  Uh, should I say yes?
[9162.45s -> 9166.71s]  I'm gonna say it.
[9166.71s -> 9169.27s]  I am the Anor Lander, you declare.
[9170.07s -> 9171.44s]  The great one.
[9171.44s -> 9172.72s]  The one who was to come.
[9173.28s -> 9174.24s]  Our savior.
[9174.24s -> 9174.88s]  Our hope.
[9176.64s -> 9177.84s]  It is too late for you.
[9178.40s -> 9179.20s]  You are dead.
[9180.42s -> 9183.06s]  Rivers of death run under the citadel beyond.
[9183.62s -> 9188.66s]  The people within are trapped in their lives as grain in the Archmage's mill.
[9190.74s -> 9193.06s]  Oh, break the spell.
[9193.06s -> 9193.78s]  Break him.
[9194.66s -> 9196.10s]  We will rise.
[9196.90s -> 9201.38s]  How can I reach him?
[9203.17s -> 9205.17s]  He hides in his tower.
[9205.81s -> 9207.57s]  He hides from us.
[9207.57s -> 9208.69s]  From the dead.
[9208.69s -> 9209.33s]  From death.
[9210.23s -> 9212.79s]  But his tower door has a key.
[9213.59s -> 9217.22s]  Something rolls up from the vent and rests by your foot.
[9217.22s -> 9218.02s]  You pick it up.
[9218.02s -> 9220.90s]  It's a vial of water that sparkles with light.
[9223.08s -> 9224.84s]  Do not drop it.
[9225.48s -> 9228.90s]  It is blessed by Kaathe himself.
[9230.63s -> 9231.91s]  King, I don't want this shit!
[9232.55s -> 9233.59s]  Kick it back into the vent.
[9238.04s -> 9238.92s]  You're dead.
[9238.92s -> 9239.72s]  We're yet to live.
[9240.60s -> 9241.32s]  You lift it up.
[9241.32s -> 9242.84s]  A vial of holy water.
[9242.84s -> 9243.80s]  Powerful, certainly.
[9243.80s -> 9246.28s]  But how will it open the door of the Archmage's tower?
[9246.92s -> 9248.44s]  The spell begins to fade.
[9248.44s -> 9253.08s]  You take the wig from your head and their words become meaningless sounds once more.
[9253.08s -> 9256.42s]  The steam hisses up and then settles on the nearby moss like dew.
[9257.22s -> 9259.22s]  Hold the vial up to the light.
[9260.48s -> 9263.20s]  You lift the vial to the light and for a moment you seem to see
[9263.20s -> 9266.80s]  laughing faces of a cruel god in the shimmers of light.
[9267.83s -> 9268.55s]  Then it is gone.
[9269.19s -> 9272.74s]  I don't have a god right now.
[9272.74s -> 9274.96s]  I'm currently godless.
[9275.52s -> 9277.01s]  There's no god here.
[9278.48s -> 9285.89s]  Um, why would I use this right now though?
[9298.47s -> 9299.43s]  I don't think I want to do anything.
[9302.61s -> 9305.49s]  As you turn, you hear something approaching you from behind.
[9306.05s -> 9307.73s]  A voice murmurs in your ear.
[9310.85s -> 9312.48s]  There you are.
[9312.48s -> 9315.76s]  Then you feel the definite presence of a hand resting across your back.
[9317.04s -> 9318.00s]  What is going on?
[9318.56s -> 9323.14s]  You sit up sharply to find a glowing presence holding a curved dagger
[9323.14s -> 9325.38s]  that has been stroking up and down your back.
[9326.40s -> 9327.44s]  It is a death wraith.
[9328.08s -> 9330.08s]  Leering at you from under its death mask.
[9331.06s -> 9333.70s]  In one bony hand it holds something up.
[9333.70s -> 9335.62s]  Something short and white and stubby.
[9337.60s -> 9338.96s]  I have been looking for you.
[9339.68s -> 9342.42s]  I have developed a taste for you, you see.
[9344.52s -> 9347.96s]  It opens its jaw revealing a terrible black void
[9347.96s -> 9350.68s]  and it delicately pops the thing into its mouth.
[9354.15s -> 9356.31s]  Wheeled by magic chain.
[9366.08s -> 9366.58s]  Thinking-
[9366.58s -> 9367.08s]  Whoa!
[9370.87s -> 9371.37s]  What?
[9373.74s -> 9375.50s]  Why do I have such a little bar?
[9380.70s -> 9381.50s]  I can't do this.
[9384.71s -> 9387.96s]  I actually might be able to do it.
[9392.98s -> 9393.48s]  That's bad.
[9395.00s -> 9397.88s]  He just did two full blasts at 4.7?
[9398.68s -> 9401.53s]  That's kind of annoying.
[9406.20s -> 9406.70s]  Oh!
[9407.08s -> 9407.58s]  Okay.
[9409.27s -> 9412.47s]  Warm air seems to cool but you seize the moment to strike.
[9412.47s -> 9415.27s]  You lash the death wraith with your length of chain.
[9415.27s -> 9419.67s]  You cut across its cruel blade and the wraith moves between the boulders.
[9419.67s -> 9421.35s]  It does not bleed but it seems to flicker.
[9421.91s -> 9423.75s]  It leans forward with crooked hands.
[9424.55s -> 9425.99s]  Your heart will be mine.
[9426.55s -> 9427.35s]  It will stop.
[9429.13s -> 9429.63s]  Um.
[9431.91s -> 9432.55s]  I had to do that.
[9433.19s -> 9434.63s]  I'm in so much trouble.
[9434.63s -> 9435.51s]  I'm in a lot of trouble.
[9436.15s -> 9439.64s]  I can't.
[9440.50s -> 9441.30s]  I'm- I can't.
[9442.10s -> 9445.48s]  Okay, you stumble and fall.
[9445.48s -> 9447.56s]  The wraith grins its bony teeth.
[9447.56s -> 9449.00s]  Okay, so do you think I can do it now?
[9449.56s -> 9450.44s]  Like 1.7?
[9451.24s -> 9451.74s]  No.
[9453.08s -> 9453.58s]  Shit.
[9457.94s -> 9458.74s]  Oh, come on.
[9460.82s -> 9461.86s]  Uh, this- I'm dead.
[9462.42s -> 9465.34s]  It's a loss.
[9469.02s -> 9469.66s]  Oh, shit.
[9469.66s -> 9470.38s]  I gotta do this again.
[9470.94s -> 9487.78s]  Okay, so how do I beat the wraith?
[9488.42s -> 9500.46s]  I'm just picking the same things I already did.
[9502.76s -> 9503.26s]  Um.
[9504.76s -> 9505.64s]  Can I aid you?
[9508.78s -> 9509.66s]  Put out the fire.
[9509.66s -> 9511.02s]  Okay, I'm the Anor Lander.
[9511.66s -> 9513.64s]  Is it- is it too late for you?
[9514.44s -> 9515.58s]  How can I reach him?
[9516.38s -> 9517.50s]  The door has a key.
[9518.55s -> 9521.27s]  Uh, this is apparently- this holy water is a key.
[9521.27s -> 9521.83s]  Hold it up.
[9521.83s -> 9522.39s]  Take a look.
[9523.37s -> 9523.87s]  Okay.
[9525.75s -> 9526.31s]  That's it.
[9526.31s -> 9527.27s]  Make a move.
[9527.27s -> 9527.91s]  Here we are.
[9527.91s -> 9528.41s]  Okay.
[9529.03s -> 9529.67s]  Turn around.
[9533.90s -> 9534.54s]  All right.
[9534.62s -> 9536.38s]  I've developed a taste for you, you see.
[9538.49s -> 9540.01s]  Okay, he puts the thing in his mouth.
[9540.82s -> 9541.54s]  What was that?
[9542.87s -> 9544.47s]  You didn't recognize it?
[9546.97s -> 9547.47s]  Figures.
[9549.21s -> 9549.77s]  Fingers!
[9550.49s -> 9553.61s]  The empty stub on your hand throbs where you lost your finger.
[9558.89s -> 9559.39s]  Uh.
[9568.22s -> 9569.18s]  Well, that's weird.
[9573.02s -> 9576.30s]  Wait, could I cause fear with the face mask?
[9577.02s -> 9579.32s]  I'm afraid that's not gonna do anything.
[9579.32s -> 9579.88s]  It's a wraith.
[9586.26s -> 9587.22s]  Oh, it's not gonna work.
[9594.79s -> 9595.29s]  Shield.
[9603.77s -> 9605.93s]  Dim is stu- wait, can I make him stupid?
[9606.65s -> 9613.61s]  You craft the spell, but it seems to have no effect on the death wraith.
[9613.61s -> 9615.61s]  Perhaps it has no mind to muddle.
[9616.25s -> 9621.74s]  Where did you get that finger?
[9622.38s -> 9625.45s]  Dug it out of a hillside in the dirt.
[9626.17s -> 9627.61s]  I've been following you ever since.
[9628.25s -> 9629.91s]  My darling.
[9632.71s -> 9633.43s]  Give it back.
[9634.87s -> 9636.71s]  Oh, it's no use to you now.
[9637.27s -> 9639.61s]  Besides, I've come to ask you for another.
[9640.25s -> 9641.67s]  How am I gonna beat this?
[9641.67s -> 9642.55s]  This is impossible.
[9643.11s -> 9647.96s]  How am I supposed to beat this?
[9658.15s -> 9658.95s]  Okay, I don't-
[9659.51s -> 9664.15s]  I have to get either really lucky or maybe like a defense thing?
[9665.85s -> 9674.47s]  Uh, I don't think I can physically win this fight.
[9675.19s -> 9679.29s]  I mean, that's all right, but I- my stamina is so low.
[9681.99s -> 9683.51s]  I can't go over two, no matter what.
[9687.67s -> 9691.75s]  I have to defend until- until he does like a 10.0.
[9692.39s -> 9695.45s]  I guess I could try.
[9695.45s -> 9696.81s]  No, I think the same thing's gonna happen.
[9697.83s -> 9698.63s]  Oh, come on!
[9699.35s -> 9716.47s]  Okay, now's my chance.
[9722.90s -> 9723.40s]  Stop!
[9723.86s -> 9729.34s]  Okay, just- just kill me because I'm- I-
[9730.22s -> 9740.92s]  So, I think I just defend two times in a row.
[9741.64s -> 9742.92s]  Defend two times in a row.
[9743.56s -> 9748.02s]  I'm gonna try it again.
[9754.65s -> 9755.61s]  Okay, so defend.
[9756.65s -> 9758.04s]  Defend again.
[9758.76s -> 9766.82s]  So now, you steady your chain.
[9766.82s -> 9768.26s]  The deathwraith wails and sings.
[9768.26s -> 9770.18s]  It slashes its blade backwards and forwards.
[9770.18s -> 9771.14s]  You parry in a flash.
[9771.86s -> 9774.26s]  You can't have any more in the tank.
[9774.82s -> 9775.38s]  There we go.
[9776.26s -> 9777.64s]  Okay.
[9778.26s -> 9781.29s]  Should I do it again?
[9781.29s -> 9782.09s]  1.0, right?
[9783.91s -> 9785.03s]  Oh, fuck.
[9785.03s -> 9789.14s]  I think I just blew it.
[9793.10s -> 9794.62s]  No, I wouldn't be able to do it here either.
[9796.30s -> 9797.66s]  I will come for your blood.
[9797.66s -> 9798.38s]  I will- okay.
[9799.69s -> 9800.81s]  Good, good, good, good, good, good.
[9800.81s -> 9802.17s]  Okay, I just have to do that two more times.
[9802.81s -> 9806.87s]  Should I go for a tiny one?
[9807.43s -> 9811.88s]  Do you think I should go for like a little one?
[9811.88s -> 9812.60s]  Or just defend?
[9815.93s -> 9816.43s]  Shit.
[9816.81s -> 9817.77s]  I'm gonna have to defend again.
[9818.49s -> 9822.43s]  Okay.
[9823.51s -> 9825.03s]  I think- is this the opportunity here to get-
[9826.71s -> 9827.03s]  Good.
[9827.03s -> 9827.91s]  Okay, just one more.
[9827.91s -> 9828.63s]  One more and I got it.
[9829.19s -> 9832.14s]  Should I go again?
[9833.86s -> 9834.74s]  That was a bad move.
[9835.93s -> 9837.29s]  Oh, I blew it big time.
[9838.01s -> 9842.01s]  I blew it big time.
[9842.01s -> 9842.81s]  I wouldn't- I can't.
[9843.37s -> 9844.25s]  I have to defend again.
[9845.70s -> 9847.22s]  Now I might be able to get it with one health.
[9847.22s -> 9847.72s]  Let's see.
[9848.34s -> 9850.01s]  1.7.
[9850.65s -> 9851.15s]  Yes!
[9851.85s -> 9857.27s]  You power at the wraith.
[9857.99s -> 9860.31s]  With a final strike, the creature wails and moans,
[9860.31s -> 9862.07s]  seeming to vanish in on itself.
[9862.07s -> 9864.55s]  The air is suddenly a little warmer, one health left.
[9867.38s -> 9871.46s]  You pant breathlessly, still shivering from the creature's terrible chewing smile.
[9872.10s -> 9874.98s]  The air cools as you move away from the vent.
[9875.70s -> 9877.32s]  What's the new clue?
[9879.11s -> 9880.71s]  Oh, the door, the door, the door.
[9881.35s -> 9883.93s]  Okay, well that was disastrous, but we're okay.
[9884.65s -> 9892.68s]  It could have been way worse.
[9893.24s -> 9906.49s]  Do I have-
[9906.49s -> 9906.99s]  What?
[9907.69s -> 9919.26s]  You make your way around to the front of the low building.
[9919.26s -> 9921.90s]  The air moves a little around you, still icy but fresh.
[9924.18s -> 9924.90s]  Look at it.
[9924.90s -> 9927.80s]  The wind washes through the upper story,
[9927.80s -> 9930.92s]  and gripweed and yellow brightspark peer out from the shattered windows.
[9931.48s -> 9933.40s]  The building was perhaps once an inn,
[9933.40s -> 9934.28s]  perhaps a trading post,
[9934.28s -> 9938.04s]  perhaps a place for guides to welcome newcomers to the great fortress beyond.
[9938.04s -> 9940.36s]  Now it has crumbled to half its state.
[9940.36s -> 9944.55s]  Pick the brightspark.
[9944.55s -> 9948.58s]  You pluck a sprig of brightspark.
[9948.58s -> 9952.92s]  It has bright yellow flowers, but it is completely useless as most wild plants are,
[9952.92s -> 9955.11s]  so quickly you toss it aside.
[9955.11s -> 9961.75s]  I can't use it for anything?
[9961.75s -> 9962.47s]  This is dangerous.
[9962.47s -> 9963.67s]  I probably shouldn't go in here, but I'm gonna.
[9965.64s -> 9967.24s]  I don't remember what happens in here.
[9967.24s -> 9969.14s]  Okay, let's go in.
[9969.14s -> 9975.38s]  You enter the crumbling building.
[9975.38s -> 9978.98s]  It is missing its roof, so you are exposed to the sky.
[9978.98s -> 9981.54s]  Search the building.
[9981.54s -> 9985.88s]  With great care, you search the rest of the room, but find nothing of interest.
[9985.88s -> 9988.10s]  The building is quite empty.
[9988.10s -> 9991.70s]  Carved on one wall is what appears to be a scratched message.
[9991.70s -> 9995.21s]  Read it.
[9995.21s -> 9998.31s]  You read over the message.
[9998.31s -> 9998.71s]  Third...
[9999.75s -> 10000.76s]  That...
[10000.76s -> 10002.12s]  Throbin doors is...
[10003.32s -> 10004.94s]  Invisib...
[10004.94s -> 10005.58s]  Curious.
[10005.58s -> 10014.31s]  The third spell that opened the Throbin doors is the spell of invisibility.
[10014.31s -> 10022.66s]  The third spell is the spell of invisibility.
[10022.66s -> 10023.54s]  Very cool.
[10023.54s -> 10028.79s]  You take a moment to rest admiring the sky, but you cannot wait here forever.
[10028.79s -> 10029.99s]  You must keep moving.
[10029.99s -> 10031.67s]  Then there's nothing more to find.
[10031.67s -> 10039.70s]  You slip outside of the age building and back into the light.
[10039.70s -> 10040.98s]  High performance IQ.
[10040.98s -> 10044.55s]  I'm personally timing you out for one second.
[10044.55s -> 10045.43s]  Actually, no, no, no.
[10045.43s -> 10046.15s]  I think that was a compliment.
[10046.15s -> 10046.71s]  Never mind.
[10046.71s -> 10050.81s]  You can stay.
[10050.81s -> 10053.77s]  You step back out onto the trail and look around once more.
[10053.77s -> 10055.93s]  Paths lead in several directions.
[10055.93s -> 10059.90s]  Let me take a look.
[10059.90s -> 10069.86s]  So this is going right up kind of main street here, leading us here.
[10069.86s -> 10076.94s]  It's also going north this way, maybe across the rocks.
[10076.94s -> 10082.10s]  I think I'm just gonna go up.
[10082.10s -> 10092.30s]  Let's go up the road.
[10092.30s -> 10095.38s]  A few clouds scud across the sky.
[10095.38s -> 10099.40s]  The trail passes a deep crack in the rock which extends southwards,
[10099.40s -> 10100.76s]  growing deeper and wider.
[10101.40s -> 10104.52s]  There's no way across the fissure, but the path leads in either direction past it.
[10109.10s -> 10111.34s]  His toupee is strangling his brain.
[10111.90s -> 10118.74s]  You ever put a hat on and you feel like that's actually happening?
[10118.74s -> 10121.46s]  A hat has to be fitted just right for me.
[10122.26s -> 10130.76s]  Or I either look like I'm five years old or I feel like my head's gonna explode.
[10130.76s -> 10134.14s]  I'm so bad getting hats that fit.
[10134.14s -> 10142.04s]  They never fit correctly for me.
[10142.04s -> 10144.28s]  You make your way up the curve, dusty rim of the crater.
[10144.28s -> 10146.57s]  An open path leads forward and up.
[10146.57s -> 10150.70s]  Skyline is suddenly dominated by the looming specter of Mampang.
[10150.70s -> 10154.60s]  As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.
[10154.60s -> 10155.64s]  Look at the citadel.
[10155.64s -> 10161.19s]  Spellbound by its presence, your eyes follow the lines of the citadel's walls.
[10161.19s -> 10166.54s]  Gnarled spires twist upwards towards the sky as if in agonized prayers to the heavens.
[10166.54s -> 10170.38s]  Sharp angles and jagged points protrude everywhere.
[10170.38s -> 10173.82s]  Demonic gargoyles line the outside walls.
[10173.82s -> 10174.54s]  Look away.
[10174.54s -> 10177.93s]  You try to look away, but you cannot.
[10177.93s -> 10180.87s]  It is as though the towers have gripped your eyes.
[10180.87s -> 10183.91s]  The sight would be enough to break the courage of any brave soldier,
[10183.91s -> 10186.07s]  and its effect on you is much the same.
[10186.07s -> 10190.68s]  You feel a knot of fear bury itself in your stomach where you cannot shake it.
[10190.68s -> 10193.62s]  Despite shivering at the sight of the citadel,
[10193.62s -> 10196.02s]  you feel yourself compelled to step forward.
[10196.02s -> 10203.45s]  All right, here we go.
[10203.45s -> 10206.17s]  Here we go into Mampang.
[10206.17s -> 10212.90s]  You clamber up the far slope of the crater until you are on the main road once more.
[10212.90s -> 10215.00s]  Look down the pass.
[10215.00s -> 10219.19s]  There are most likely guards stationed with a view over the pass.
[10219.27s -> 10222.55s]  This is the only route into the citadel and is certain to be guarded.
[10222.55s -> 10225.30s]  Then suddenly you feel a wave of nausea.
[10225.30s -> 10226.68s]  The ground beneath you shifts.
[10226.68s -> 10229.00s]  The sun slides sideways.
[10229.00s -> 10230.92s]  Oh boy.
[10230.92s -> 10232.84s]  You open your arms to cast a spell when you fall.
[10233.40s -> 10235.96s]  The world rushes past you further than it should.
[10235.96s -> 10240.26s]  You hear a woman's voice singing gently above the sound of lapping waves.
[10240.26s -> 10250.60s]  What magic is this?
[10250.60s -> 10253.32s]  Back in Shumantati Hills.
[10254.76s -> 10259.61s]  Waves lull and wash towards the shore.
[10259.61s -> 10261.86s]  Lapping water.
[10261.86s -> 10263.78s]  You lie on a bed of stones.
[10264.04s -> 10267.80s]  Looking up at the bright sunlight.
[10267.80s -> 10269.37s]  Where am I?
[10269.37s -> 10271.05s]  This is not high salmon.
[10271.05s -> 10273.35s]  A feeling of dread creeps over you.
[10273.35s -> 10274.87s]  What kind of trap is this?
[10274.87s -> 10276.23s]  How far have you traveled?
[10276.23s -> 10282.50s]  You open your arms to gather the stars to you.
[10282.50s -> 10283.62s]  Stay your hand.
[10283.62s -> 10288.50s]  You will not need protection here.
[10288.50s -> 10289.70s]  Look for the speaker.
[10289.70s -> 10298.79s]  You turn this way and that looking for the speaker but seeing nothing but the washing water and spray.
[10298.79s -> 10300.44s]  Who are you?
[10300.44s -> 10302.07s]  You call.
[10302.07s -> 10306.17s]  I have many names but none truly describe who I am.
[10306.17s -> 10309.90s]  The sea washes at your boots as though inviting you to step forward.
[10313.13s -> 10314.01s]  Am I dreaming?
[10314.01s -> 10316.66s]  A gentle wind tugs at your coat.
[10316.66s -> 10319.22s]  As you shiver, you realize this is no dream.
[10319.22s -> 10322.18s]  You are standing on the shore of the Kakabad Sea.
[10322.18s -> 10324.42s]  Barely half days walk from Analand.
[10324.42s -> 10330.78s]  This is my hometown right here.
[10330.78s -> 10336.01s]  This is where I came from.
[10336.01s -> 10341.13s]  This is part one.
[10341.13s -> 10343.69s]  Those of you that are curious, this is sorcery one.
[10343.69s -> 10351.10s]  So we're back here.
[10351.10s -> 10352.62s]  You crunch towards the shore.
[10352.62s -> 10355.90s]  In the glinting water, a boat slowly rocks to and fro.
[10355.90s -> 10361.22s]  And in the boat sits a woman with a loom.
[10361.22s -> 10362.74s]  Why did you bring me here?
[10362.74s -> 10364.62s]  You ask.
[10364.62s -> 10366.78s]  We have walked a long road together.
[10366.78s -> 10368.66s]  Perhaps you do not know it.
[10368.66s -> 10371.06s]  But that road is almost at its end.
[10371.06s -> 10374.46s]  I bring you here to deliver a warning.
[10374.46s -> 10377.02s]  I am Libra, goddess of justice.
[10377.02s -> 10381.62s]  And our long road together has almost reached its end.
[10381.62s -> 10383.70s]  I have kept you safe many times.
[10383.70s -> 10384.50s]  Saved you.
[10384.50s -> 10391.10s]  But I can do no more.
[10391.10s -> 10392.54s]  We have never met.
[10392.54s -> 10394.22s]  You have never aided me.
[10394.22s -> 10396.89s]  You reply.
[10396.89s -> 10399.98s]  You do not understand.
[10399.98s -> 10401.70s]  But you will soon enough.
[10401.70s -> 10406.02s]  When you enter Mampang, you will understand.
[10406.02s -> 10410.10s]  The walls around that citadel are more than those of physical stone.
[10410.10s -> 10411.54s]  It is a cursed place.
[10411.54s -> 10416.01s]  Guarded by sigils and long knives.
[10416.01s -> 10417.77s]  I don't- I don't- I don't know.
[10417.77s -> 10418.41s]  I don't-
[10418.41s -> 10420.44s]  I will explain, Anor Lander.
[10420.44s -> 10424.02s]  For as long as you have walked, I have walked beside you.
[10424.02s -> 10426.36s]  I have granted you waking dreams.
[10426.36s -> 10427.32s]  Dreams of your future.
[10427.32s -> 10434.47s]  Dreams from which you wake to walk a different way.
[10434.47s -> 10434.97s]  I-
[10437.70s -> 10438.90s]  Waking dreams.
[10438.90s -> 10441.90s]  The kind that seem real.
[10450.20s -> 10451.08s]  Reset, reset.
[10451.08s -> 10452.52s]  Let me take a new take, new take.
[10452.52s -> 10455.96s]  Take two, take two.
[10455.96s -> 10457.59s]  Waking dreams.
[10457.59s -> 10458.87s]  The goddess continues.
[10458.87s -> 10462.78s]  The kind that seem real.
[10462.78s -> 10466.94s]  Until they disappear as though they had never been.
[10466.94s -> 10470.57s]  She shoots the shuttle across her loom once more.
[10470.57s -> 10471.85s]  But no more.
[10471.85s -> 10475.37s]  Once inside the walls of Mampang, your future will become precious once again.
[10475.37s -> 10479.16s]  The word strikes a knell of fear in your heart.
[10479.16s -> 10482.65s]  I- I- I-
[10482.65s -> 10485.50s]  I- I grow tired of riddles.
[10485.50s -> 10486.94s]  A weave can be made.
[10486.94s -> 10488.06s]  And then unmade.
[10488.06s -> 10490.22s]  And made again in different fashion.
[10490.22s -> 10494.46s]  The final garment does not know how many times it was stitched.
[10494.46s -> 10495.90s]  So it has been with your journey.
[10500.01s -> 10505.78s]  Or perhaps you consider yourself to be simply have been lucky to have survived so far.
[10505.78s -> 10509.46s]  A large wave strikes the shore.
[10509.46s -> 10513.53s]  And as it drains, the boat tilts and begins to drift away.
[10513.53s -> 10516.01s]  You realize although this woman is very intelligent.
[10516.01s -> 10517.13s]  And maybe a god.
[10517.13s -> 10521.42s]  She has a really, really strange off-putting laugh.
[10521.42s -> 10524.09s]  The woman makes no move to stop.
[10524.09s -> 10527.85s]  Merely continuing to weave.
[10527.85s -> 10528.35s]  Wait!
[10528.73s -> 10531.50s]  How can I leave this place?
[10531.50s -> 10532.00s]  Oh.
[10532.86s -> 10535.61s]  She's gone.
[10535.61s -> 10540.26s]  The thought of the long journey back to Mampang begins to sink into your mind.
[10540.26s -> 10542.55s]  I'm going to the cave.
[10542.55s -> 10549.19s]  You step away from the water towards the mouth of a dim cave.
[10549.19s -> 10552.20s]  Inside, the stone drips salty tears.
[10552.20s -> 10559.34s]  These tunnels must be flooded at high tide.
[10559.34s -> 10563.58s]  Gideon Ophnir, the all-knowing, is just Santa from the Christmas M&M's commercial.
[10563.58s -> 10568.02s]  I don't get it.
[10568.02s -> 10571.64s]  I don't get it.
[10571.64s -> 10573.64s]  Okay, let's, uh, look around the cave.
[10573.64s -> 10579.05s]  The cave walls are jagged and irregular.
[10579.05s -> 10583.03s]  Formed by lashing waves and shifting rocks of a thousand years.
[10583.03s -> 10586.63s]  Here and there, crystal seams wink from deep within the frozen stone folds.
[10586.63s -> 10589.27s]  Go deeper.
[10589.27s -> 10592.71s]  You push deeper into the cave, climbing over fallen stones.
[10592.71s -> 10593.35s]  I'm so sorry.
[10593.35s -> 10595.91s]  There's one person in chat that's gonna make me redo this line like five times
[10595.91s -> 10597.03s]  until I get it the way that they want it.
[10597.03s -> 10599.38s]  So I'm gonna just get in front of this.
[10599.38s -> 10606.07s]  You push deeper into the cave, climbing over fallen stones.
[10606.07s -> 10606.71s]  Stones.
[10606.71s -> 10610.97s]  Follow the line of the deepest darkness up into the towering cliffside.
[10610.97s -> 10614.09s]  Somewhere overhead are the low hills around Kantapani.
[10614.09s -> 10616.57s]  And a short distance from that is where your home is.
[10616.57s -> 10619.14s]  You climb higher still, upwards into the rock.
[10619.46s -> 10621.62s]  Something in the distance begins to roar and moan.
[10621.62s -> 10623.83s]  You are not alone in the darkness.
[10623.83s -> 10629.99s]  You can't cast any spells here.
[10629.99s -> 10634.90s]  You open your arms to cast a spell as a great wind begins to rush through the tunnel.
[10634.90s -> 10637.86s]  Gathering in strength and force as it tries to push you back.
[10637.86s -> 10642.46s]  Your arms are pushed apart and their power unbinds before it can form.
[10642.46s -> 10644.55s]  You are falling.
[10644.55s -> 10647.27s]  As you begin to fall, the stars reach down to catch you.
[10655.75s -> 10658.36s]  You are back on the edge of the pass.
[10658.36s -> 10659.56s]  Was that real?
[10659.56s -> 10663.48s]  A taste in my mouth.
[10663.48s -> 10666.12s]  There is a taste of salt in your mouth.
[10666.12s -> 10667.45s]  But nothing more.
[10667.45s -> 10670.57s]  You shake the vision away and look around yourself once more.
[10670.57s -> 10674.81s]  I'm going to rest.
[10674.81s -> 10679.38s]  Looking at the pass ahead, it would be best to try and cross under cover of darkness.
[10679.38s -> 10680.90s]  You settle down to wait.
[10680.90s -> 10684.58s]  The sun disappears behind the tall mountains and a few stars appear between the peaks.
[10689.90s -> 10694.89s]  Okay.
[10694.89s -> 10695.85s]  You get to your feet once more.
[10695.85s -> 10696.81s]  Night has settled around you.
[10696.81s -> 10699.21s]  You creep forwards into the narrow rock pass.
[10699.21s -> 10701.88s]  This is the only corridor to Mampang.
[10701.88s -> 10708.31s]  There is no other way into the pass.
[10708.31s -> 10711.77s]  You ever seen Arrested Development?
[10711.77s -> 10712.27s]  Yeah.
[10712.81s -> 10713.77s]  Long time ago.
[10713.93s -> 10714.97s]  I thought it was good.
[10714.97s -> 10717.66s]  I liked it a lot.
[10717.66s -> 10721.42s]  They did that like 10 years later season, right?
[10721.98s -> 10723.72s]  I thought that was all right.
[10723.72s -> 10725.40s]  I prefer the original, obviously.
[10725.40s -> 10729.11s]  I think everybody probably does.
[10729.11s -> 10732.15s]  You make your way slowly forward as the narrow walls close in on either side.
[10732.15s -> 10733.43s]  The sun disappears.
[10733.43s -> 10738.65s]  Okay.
[10739.75s -> 10740.25s]  Look ahead.
[10744.87s -> 10747.99s]  In the darkness, you can make out little but the slight curve of the road
[10748.63s -> 10751.67s]  and the mountain slopes that cut out the sky on either side.
[10753.61s -> 10754.33s]  Stop and listen.
[10755.77s -> 10757.69s]  You still your breath and listen for any movement
[10757.69s -> 10759.69s]  but only hear the wind whistling through the pass.
[10760.49s -> 10761.94s]  I'm going to climb the rocks.
[10764.25s -> 10767.53s]  You grasp the rocks and try to climb but it is too tiring.
[10767.53s -> 10772.30s]  You only manage to climb up a few feet before slipping back down.
[10772.30s -> 10773.18s]  The pass lies open.
[10773.18s -> 10776.46s]  There are no obvious traps and there are no ways around.
[10776.46s -> 10779.31s]  Okay.
[10782.76s -> 10784.44s]  The only way is forwards.
[10785.16s -> 10787.16s]  You move cautiously along the shadowy pass.
[10787.80s -> 10790.84s]  It is barely wide enough for two horses to ride
[10790.84s -> 10793.54s]  but the walls on either side loom high and threatening.
[10794.34s -> 10796.10s]  Starlight pools around you.
[10796.10s -> 10797.46s]  There is magic here.
[10797.46s -> 10799.85s]  Peer upwards.
[10799.85s -> 10802.49s]  Looking upwards, you see the cliff edges look smoother somehow
[10802.49s -> 10805.13s]  as the loose rocks have been moved away from the cliff edge.
[10805.69s -> 10809.26s]  What can I do here?
[10810.78s -> 10819.24s]  Hey, can you give me some motivation to start my programming homework?
[10819.24s -> 10821.82s]  Yeah, go do it.
[10824.86s -> 10826.94s]  All right, I think we've solved that.
[10826.94s -> 10839.34s]  Somebody said that guy said that an hour ago.
[10839.98s -> 10842.36s]  Did I read that wrong?
[10847.18s -> 10848.54s]  Wait, can I just teleport?
[10849.34s -> 10851.40s]  I think I want to teleport into the castle.
[10852.04s -> 10859.42s]  All right, I'm either going to try teleporting or
[10861.88s -> 10862.60s]  that's cheating.
[10863.56s -> 10864.36s]  Is it though?
[10864.36s -> 10865.96s]  Does it make a smelly smell?
[10865.96s -> 10866.76s]  Yeah.
[10866.76s -> 10872.65s]  You grab your nose plugs and stick them into your nostrils before casting the spell.
[10873.21s -> 10877.82s]  A terrible odor begins to blossom from your sleeves in a choking cloud.
[10877.82s -> 10882.39s]  All it accomplishes though is filling up the pass with a noxious stench.
[10882.39s -> 10887.45s]  No guards tumble from high perches coughing and choking.
[10887.45s -> 10889.21s]  Well, I definitely can do that up there.
[10889.21s -> 10891.64s]  I'm going 100%.
[10892.52s -> 10898.14s]  I can do that in front of the gate.
[10898.14s -> 10898.86s]  You pass.
[10898.86s -> 10900.78s]  You pace silently along the narrow path.
[10900.78s -> 10904.09s]  Perhaps no one is expecting you after all.
[10904.09s -> 10907.05s]  I'm definitely going to do like a big like stinky move up here.
[10907.61s -> 10916.70s]  Can somebody please explain this starlight thing to me?
[10916.70s -> 10918.06s]  Just link me the wiki page.
[10920.44s -> 10921.88s]  I don't think there even is anything to even know.
[10922.52s -> 10926.86s]  The end of the pass is almost in sight.
[10926.86s -> 10928.30s]  It is very dark down here.
[10928.30s -> 10930.46s]  The night sky, a thin strip of blue above.
[10931.10s -> 10934.70s]  Glancing up, you see a dancing light a short distance ahead.
[10934.70s -> 10935.58s]  Guards.
[10935.58s -> 10939.26s]  They are above you staring down into the pass and the cliff tops.
[10939.26s -> 10943.10s]  A small fire crackles behind them, but the light does not reach the bottom of the pass.
[10943.66s -> 10946.92s]  Okay, sneak forward.
[10948.17s -> 10950.81s]  You crouch in the heavy nighttime shadows and sneak along.
[10951.37s -> 10954.33s]  A lone guard stands above but does not see you.
[10954.97s -> 10958.47s]  You leave the guards behind as you reach the end of the pass.
[10958.47s -> 10960.31s]  Oh, coming here at night I think solves this problem.
[10963.05s -> 10964.81s]  You follow the path between sharp peaks.
[10964.81s -> 10966.33s]  Moonlight covers everything.
[10966.33s -> 10972.41s]  And then the pass opens and provides you with your first clear view of the Citadel's gate.
[10972.41s -> 10977.22s]  After 33 days of walking and hardship, you have arrived.
[10978.70s -> 10983.69s]  Mampang.
[10983.69s -> 10984.25s]  There it is.
[10986.31s -> 10986.81s]  Bones.
[10987.35s -> 10987.83s]  Rocks.
[10987.83s -> 10988.33s]  Stones.
[10989.61s -> 10990.11s]  Death.
[10990.73s -> 10991.45s]  Dried blood.
[10992.17s -> 10992.67s]  Spirits.
[10994.76s -> 10995.80s]  Echoing wails.
[10995.80s -> 10996.30s]  Agony.
[10998.18s -> 11000.44s]  Good luck.
[11000.44s -> 11003.45s]  The dread Citadel seems to be at peace.
[11003.45s -> 11006.89s]  There are no patrols of birdmen, no marching guards on the walls.
[11007.82s -> 11010.06s]  They're not expecting your arrival in the least.
[11010.78s -> 11013.66s]  It seems you have covered your approach flawlessly.
[11015.03s -> 11017.75s]  Stars turn in the empty air above you.
[11017.75s -> 11020.07s]  Actually made it for the first time ever.
[11020.07s -> 11024.17s]  The first time ever playing this game.
[11024.17s -> 11025.85s]  Which I played through it at least three or four times.
[11026.41s -> 11027.45s]  Getting here without being...
[11028.57s -> 11032.01s]  Like they know I was coming every other time I played it.
[11032.01s -> 11034.86s]  So I have no idea what this even happens here.
[11034.86s -> 11037.72s]  Because last time I played it I didn't do this.
[11037.72s -> 11039.85s]  Before that I didn't do it either.
[11039.85s -> 11041.45s]  You have to kill all seven serpents.
[11042.18s -> 11051.10s]  And I think you have to do all the 100% Kare too, don't you?
[11051.10s -> 11053.26s]  Um, maybe I should just sleep here.
[11053.82s -> 11054.46s]  Is that a stupid move?
[11055.10s -> 11059.08s]  Because I need health.
[11061.45s -> 11064.41s]  Although if I wake up in the morning I can't really sneak around though.
[11064.41s -> 11064.81s]  Hold on.
[11071.08s -> 11073.34s]  Mmm, I'm just gonna do it.
[11075.46s -> 11077.94s]  All right, this seems to be nothing but to do but wait.
[11077.94s -> 11080.58s]  You find a corner of the road and settle down to sleep.
[11080.58s -> 11082.50s]  Laying your pack down you try to rest despite the wind.
[11083.14s -> 11084.98s]  You do not need to eat anymore today.
[11084.98s -> 11087.45s]  You get comfortable and rest.
[11088.78s -> 11092.62s]  All right, so a Libra apparently was telling us.
[11092.62s -> 11094.62s]  Like, I am in your dreams, right?
[11094.62s -> 11097.72s]  The remainder of the night is kept busy with vivid dreams.
[11098.36s -> 11101.34s]  You are curled up on a bed of straw and bones.
[11101.34s -> 11105.26s]  A bird maid is carefully plucking grit from your skin.
[11105.82s -> 11108.46s]  And nuzzling you with its cruel hooked beak.
[11109.38s -> 11111.54s]  You are safe, warm.
[11111.54s -> 11114.02s]  She feeds you with still living rabbit.
[11114.02s -> 11117.02s]  A pair of rich black eyes are fixed on you.
[11117.02s -> 11119.02s]  A figure in shadow purrs your name.
[11119.58s -> 11122.46s]  The voice is rich, beautiful, and compelling.
[11122.46s -> 11126.33s]  Aliana or Flanker?
[11126.33s -> 11129.37s]  Flanker?
[11131.27s -> 11132.23s]  I am here for you.
[11132.95s -> 11134.07s]  I will take your hand.
[11135.16s -> 11136.92s]  Flanker murmurs softly in return.
[11137.80s -> 11141.32s]  And all the while you hear distant laughter from the east.
[11146.36s -> 11150.68s]  You ate some provisions, met Libra, the goddess of justice, and the long peace.
[11151.67s -> 11153.67s]  The archmage remains unaware of you.
[11158.66s -> 11163.30s]  You wake to the rumble of cartwheels along the road and pick yourself to your feet.
[11163.30s -> 11166.17s]  The wide gates are open but surrounded by guards.
[11166.17s -> 11169.06s]  Scores of merchants cluster around the end of the road.
[11169.06s -> 11170.89s]  People.
[11170.89s -> 11171.77s]  People!
[11171.77s -> 11175.11s]  You take a moment to drink in the sight.
[11175.11s -> 11178.71s]  Manpang's walls are towering and they march away on either side.
[11178.71s -> 11181.43s]  Guard turrets jutting against the dark blue sky.
[11181.43s -> 11183.75s]  The fortress is the size of a small city.
[11183.75s -> 11187.78s]  And somewhere inside is the crown of kings.
[11187.78s -> 11189.06s]  Look for ways in.
[11189.06s -> 11190.82s]  You scan the area for entry points.
[11190.82s -> 11192.06s]  The main gate.
[11192.06s -> 11193.02s]  The side entrance.
[11193.02s -> 11193.58s]  The road.
[11194.63s -> 11198.20s]  The main gate.
[11198.20s -> 11201.40s]  A short, well-paved road leads right up to the main gate.
[11201.40s -> 11205.38s]  It is bound in strips of iron and taller than most trees.
[11205.38s -> 11207.14s]  Carts approach the gate in orderly fashion.
[11207.14s -> 11209.70s]  Most are searched, emptied, and turn quickly around.
[11209.70s -> 11211.70s]  A few are allowed into the yard.
[11211.70s -> 11215.45s]  Guards armed with bows stand ready to cut down any unwelcome visitors.
[11215.45s -> 11218.65s]  The side entrance.
[11218.65s -> 11222.97s]  Following the wall with your eyes, you see a path following the stone wall of the keep westwards.
[11222.97s -> 11225.10s]  There may be another entrance that way.
[11225.10s -> 11227.30s]  Or the road.
[11227.30s -> 11232.34s]  Finally away to the east, the road from the gate disappears off towards distant lands.
[11232.34s -> 11235.83s]  Heading that way would mean leaving the citadel behind.
[11235.83s -> 11237.43s]  Time to make your choice.
[11237.43s -> 11240.47s]  Watch the carts.
[11240.47s -> 11246.28s]  Did I do- I feel like I may have done this last time.
[11246.28s -> 11247.64s]  You watch the carts carefully.
[11247.64s -> 11248.92s]  Each is laden with goods.
[11248.92s -> 11252.97s]  The guards inspect them fairly curiously, patting down their contents.
[11252.97s -> 11254.68s]  Contents?
[11254.68s -> 11255.48s]  Contents.
[11255.48s -> 11257.08s]  Before waving them through.
[11257.08s -> 11259.91s]  Their contents.
[11259.91s -> 11263.99s]  Alright, am I hiding in a cart or are we going somewhere else?
[11263.99s -> 11265.43s]  It's time for a poll.
[11265.43s -> 11270.01s]  It's time for a poll.
[11270.01s -> 11272.09s]  Hide in cart or make a move.
[11272.09s -> 11276.02s]  Because after we pick one of these, I think we're stuck with it.
[11276.02s -> 11282.74s]  And while you figure that out, I'm going to drink some more of my delicious drink.
[11290.65s -> 11298.84s]  Did you eat the BLT already?
[11298.84s -> 11309.61s]  Yes, I did.
[11309.61s -> 11310.65s]  Eat another one.
[11310.65s -> 11317.06s]  Are you drinking Abyssinth?
[11317.06s -> 11320.95s]  No.
[11320.95s -> 11326.38s]  Why would you just automatically go to Absinthe of all the drinks in the world?
[11326.38s -> 11331.45s]  Oh, let me get a nice sip of my- of my nice beverage.
[11331.45s -> 11337.74s]  Is it Absinthe?
[11337.74s -> 11342.84s]  Anytime I've ever heard of Absinthe and seen what it looks like, I always feel like it's
[11342.84s -> 11353.29s]  some weird magical potion from like the 1400s.
[11353.29s -> 11356.68s]  Alright, looks like we're hiding in the cart.
[11356.68s -> 11357.80s]  It kind of is.
[11357.80s -> 11360.46s]  Because it is.
[11360.46s -> 11365.18s]  Yeah, Absinthe just looks like it belongs in Skyrim or something.
[11365.18s -> 11371.19s]  Okay, let's hide in the cart.
[11371.19s -> 11376.15s]  You fall in behind a merchant's cart and unnoticed flip up the tarpaulin that covers
[11376.15s -> 11376.95s]  the back.
[11376.95s -> 11378.97s]  You have plenty of time to jump inside.
[11378.97s -> 11384.18s]  The guards are quizzing each merchant and examining their stock as they reach the gate.
[11384.18s -> 11385.69s]  Jump in.
[11385.69s -> 11388.09s]  There is a crunch as you settle down inside.
[11388.65s -> 11390.81s]  You've sat on a group of very large eggs.
[11391.37s -> 11393.37s]  In fact, the whole cart is full of them.
[11393.37s -> 11395.62s]  The cart rumbles forward.
[11395.62s -> 11397.69s]  Uh-oh.
[11397.69s -> 11403.48s]  The cart rumbles slowly down the rough road.
[11403.48s -> 11404.52s]  Just cast a spell.
[11406.60s -> 11407.56s]  Alright, what can I do in here?
[11410.79s -> 11413.69s]  Uh, sap?
[11413.69s -> 11416.57s]  I could cause depression to, what, the driver?
[11418.18s -> 11420.18s]  Oh, I can make a smelly smell.
[11424.95s -> 11430.22s]  Uh, what is this?
[11430.22s -> 11432.14s]  Oh, summon a giant.
[11435.94s -> 11436.98s]  Will they know it's me, though?
[11436.98s -> 11440.58s]  If I summon a giant and just say, hey, just like jump over the fucking fence or whatever
[11440.58s -> 11440.82s]  it is.
[11440.82s -> 11441.70s]  Jump over the gate.
[11445.51s -> 11446.95s]  Okay, hold on.
[11448.54s -> 11450.70s]  We might need another vote because this is kind of important.
[11454.15s -> 11454.95s]  Horse field.
[11458.73s -> 11460.33s]  Alright, are we going to?
[11462.73s -> 11467.45s]  Okay, it's either depression, smelly.
[11470.52s -> 11472.36s]  I can make the cart faster.
[11472.36s -> 11473.16s]  What would even happen?
[11473.16s -> 11474.28s]  Would we just barrel through?
[11475.16s -> 11475.96s]  Alright, smell.
[11477.35s -> 11479.67s]  Uh, what was the last one?
[11479.67s -> 11480.39s]  Oh, okay.
[11480.39s -> 11484.98s]  Giant, smell, or what was the first one?
[11485.54s -> 11486.02s]  Depression.
[11487.67s -> 11489.43s]  Smelly, giant, depression.
[11492.71s -> 11495.43s]  Giant, smelly, depression.
[11496.31s -> 11496.79s]  Which one?
[11518.42s -> 11522.26s]  Yeah, saying it together sounds kind of weird, right?
[11522.82s -> 11524.18s]  Alright, it's going to be smelly.
[11524.18s -> 11525.38s]  Smelly is winning by so much.
[11526.94s -> 11528.06s]  Alright, let's do it.
[11528.06s -> 11528.78s]  There's no way.
[11528.78s -> 11530.86s]  There's like hundreds more.
[11541.02s -> 11543.98s]  Rose, I don't think the sorcery council is going to be pleased anymore.
[11547.83s -> 11548.55s]  Alright, let's do it.
[11553.11s -> 11556.39s]  I've not really had nose plugs in any of my playthroughs either, so this is kind of fun.
[11556.39s -> 11556.71s]  Let's see.
[11557.51s -> 11561.54s]  You grab your nose plugs and stick them into your nostrils before casting the spell.
[11562.02s -> 11565.30s]  A terrible odor begins to blossom from your sleeves in a choking cloud.
[11566.18s -> 11570.58s]  The cloud of stench stays trapped under the tarpaulin.
[11570.58s -> 11571.54s]  Your trap is set.
[11571.54s -> 11572.26s]  Now you wait.
[11572.26s -> 11575.66s]  Wait, I just, I just, oh no, that's not good.
[11584.01s -> 11585.21s]  It's underneath me.
[11585.21s -> 11586.41s]  I've got it trapped with me.
[11590.57s -> 11593.29s]  The cart trundles forward, then stops again.
[11593.29s -> 11595.21s]  You hear a guard's boots crunching near.
[11595.85s -> 11596.95s]  What have you got?
[11597.99s -> 11599.35s]  The merchant's voice is reedy.
[11600.15s -> 11602.15s]  Basilisk eggs, sir.
[11602.15s -> 11604.23s]  For the archmage's table, I am told.
[11606.20s -> 11606.52s]  Wait.
[11607.32s -> 11611.08s]  You wait in your stench-filled cart, with literally bated breath.
[11611.64s -> 11612.65s]  Is that so?
[11613.45s -> 11614.65s]  Let me have a look.
[11614.65s -> 11620.98s]  Corner of the tarpaulin flips, letting in a little light, and letting out the smell.
[11620.98s -> 11624.63s]  The guard staggers back, coughing and choking.
[11624.63s -> 11625.11s]  What by-
[11625.67s -> 11626.31s]  Greeds!
[11626.31s -> 11626.79s]  Nipples!
[11629.30s -> 11630.58s]  Basilisk eggs!
[11631.22s -> 11634.44s]  The merchant replies, as if talking to a child.
[11634.44s -> 11639.67s]  They smell terrible when they go bad.
[11639.67s -> 11642.42s]  Uh, I'm gonna wait.
[11642.42s -> 11644.26s]  You wait, intense silence.
[11645.19s -> 11645.67s]  Fine.
[11647.43s -> 11648.47s]  Get on with ya.
[11648.47s -> 11650.63s]  But don't open that tap again.
[11650.63s -> 11656.09s]  The cart rattles forward, to the gate of Mampang, and then inside.
[11658.57s -> 11659.77s]  Yeah, we did it.
[11659.77s -> 11660.97s]  Didn't alert anything.
[11660.97s -> 11662.41s]  Finally, for the first time ever.
[11662.97s -> 11668.84s]  There's a thundering echo for a moment as the cart passes through the tight doorway.
[11668.84s -> 11673.22s]  Then it emerges into the relative quiet of the Mampang's main yard.
[11673.22s -> 11674.90s]  You slip out of the cart into the yard.
[11674.90s -> 11678.18s]  I can't believe that worked.
[11678.18s -> 11682.79s]  The shadow of Mampang falls over you like a cloak.
[11682.79s -> 11688.23s]  It is as though the sun itself has dimmed, and you feel suddenly more cold and alone
[11688.23s -> 11689.58s]  than ever before.
[11689.58s -> 11694.73s]  But you have no choice but to continue.
[11694.73s -> 11697.05s]  A voice in your head whispers,
[11697.05s -> 11698.28s]  Good luck.
[11698.28s -> 11701.38s]  Before fading into the murmur of waves.
[11701.38s -> 11703.14s]  You've entered the citadel of Mampang.
[11703.70s -> 11710.81s]  Here, no decision can be rewound.
[11710.81s -> 11711.31s]  Uh oh.
[11715.58s -> 11716.08s]  Jesus!
[11722.22s -> 11723.42s]  That was really loud.
[11724.78s -> 11729.71s]  I forgot it happens, like, right there, too.
[11729.71s -> 11732.51s]  The early morning sun makes the air glow.
[11732.51s -> 11734.35s]  It is immediately clear.
[11734.35s -> 11736.97s]  This was once a grand entranceway.
[11736.97s -> 11741.87s]  The remains of tall statues, like those on the southern shore of Lake...
[11741.87s -> 11743.23s]  You know the one.
[11743.23s -> 11744.99s]  Line the road on either side.
[11744.99s -> 11751.15s]  But their welcoming expressions have worn smooth, and their bodies have sheared.
[11751.15s -> 11752.57s]  Count the statues.
[11752.57s -> 11756.33s]  There are four statues on one side of the path, and four on the other.
[11756.33s -> 11756.89s]  Eight.
[11756.89s -> 11759.18s]  Look at them.
[11759.18s -> 11761.74s]  Each stands, or stood, twice your height,
[11761.74s -> 11765.72s]  and their arms are all outstretched at different angles and orientations.
[11765.72s -> 11768.44s]  They're clearly in the act of crafting magic.
[11768.44s -> 11775.07s]  But which spell is each casting is all but impossible to tell.
[11775.07s -> 11777.71s]  Many have lost their arms, and many more of their fingers,
[11777.71s -> 11781.79s]  and most of their pursed, whispering mouths have crumbled to powder.
[11781.79s -> 11784.27s]  Approach a statue.
[11784.27s -> 11789.39s]  The statue nearest to the gate is reasonably intact.
[11789.39s -> 11794.54s]  Going over to it, you make out a portion of a ruined inscription at its base.
[11794.54s -> 11795.34s]  D.O.
[11795.34s -> 11800.59s]  The statue opposite also has a carving at its base.
[11800.59s -> 11803.39s]  Read the carving opposite.
[11803.39s -> 11810.33s]  You cross to the other side of the path and squat down, making out the letters O.T.
[11810.33s -> 11812.89s]  So they're countering each other?
[11812.89s -> 11819.39s]  So that's dock and hot?
[11819.39s -> 11822.84s]  I think we already knew that.
[11822.84s -> 11828.12s]  The next statue along from the gate is broken at the waist and carved with F.A. at its base.
[11828.12s -> 11831.84s]  Stands opposite another, whose carving reads O.K.
[11835.58s -> 11837.58s]  I think that's fall?
[11837.58s -> 11840.22s]  And then walk?
[11840.22s -> 11841.10s]  W.O.K.?
[11841.10s -> 11843.36s]  I think we already knew that too.
[11847.93s -> 11852.33s]  You search the other statues for any more readable carvings, but one is missing entirely.
[11852.33s -> 11854.81s]  Another two have been firmly destroyed,
[11854.81s -> 11859.28s]  leaving only the last statue in line which stands tall, arms raised upwards.
[11859.28s -> 11864.30s]  It holds a stone vial upended in one fist, and has a skull beneath its foot.
[11864.30s -> 11866.86s]  Look opposite.
[11866.86s -> 11870.73s]  Opposite the statue is nothing but an empty plinth.
[11870.73s -> 11875.00s]  Carved at its foot are three characters, overgrown with moss.
[11875.00s -> 11878.86s]  Clear the moss away.
[11878.86s -> 11888.22s]  You pull the clumps of moss free to reveal the name of the spell.
[11888.22s -> 11889.02s]  Z.
[11889.02s -> 11893.20s]  You cannot hold back a shiver.
[11893.20s -> 11896.84s]  This is truly the Fortress of Sorcerers.
[11896.84s -> 11904.96s]  A place where the weirdest spell of all is not hidden away, but displayed in the main yard.
[11904.96s -> 11908.00s]  Perhaps someone here even knows what this spell does.
[11908.00s -> 11910.84s]  You hurry away from the statues, feeling as though they are watching you.
[11916.99s -> 11920.06s]  The weirdest spell, yeah.
[11920.06s -> 11921.66s]  This is a weird spell.
[11921.66s -> 11924.00s]  The center of the yard.
[11924.00s -> 11929.47s]  You stride further into the bustling yard.
[11929.47s -> 11931.71s]  The air stirs a little, still cold but fresh.
[11931.71s -> 11934.70s]  The square is busy with traders and their porters,
[11934.78s -> 11937.50s]  carting goods from the gate to the high inner wall,
[11937.50s -> 11941.10s]  where a rack of pulleys and ropes is in constant operation.
[11941.10s -> 11945.21s]  Strangely, there is no door in the wall into the city.
[11945.21s -> 11950.01s]  That's weird.
[11950.01s -> 11952.97s]  Doors are set into the walls on either side of the yard.
[11952.97s -> 11955.69s]  The east-rich smells come from a noisy kitchen.
[11955.69s -> 11960.76s]  To the west are a series of rooms through which guards occasionally walk.
[11960.76s -> 11961.72s]  Watch the pulleys.
[11961.72s -> 11967.29s]  You watch the crews on top of the tall wall working the pulleys on top of the wall,
[11967.29s -> 11970.08s]  transferring goods into the city inside.
[11970.08s -> 11973.69s]  Perhaps there is a way to use them, but you cannot see one.
[11973.69s -> 11980.11s]  There are scores of people working on every rope and nowhere to hide.
[11980.11s -> 11980.99s]  News reporter.
[11982.43s -> 11983.79s]  All right, I'll do it as a news reporter.
[11985.71s -> 11987.31s]  Most of the merchants are stopped at the gate,
[11987.31s -> 11990.83s]  but a few are allowed to drive their carts all the way up to the far wall.
[11990.83s -> 11993.15s]  Here, their goods are unloaded, strapped to the ropes,
[11993.15s -> 11997.02s]  and hoisted over the wall, presumably into the citadel proper.
[11997.02s -> 11999.26s]  Gold coins are shuttled back again.
[11999.26s -> 12000.78s]  It seems remarkably elaborate.
[12000.78s -> 12004.49s]  Let's talk to a merchant.
[12004.49s -> 12006.41s]  You find a merchant waiting for a free rope.
[12006.41s -> 12009.21s]  He nods a cautious greeting as you come to stand beside him.
[12009.21s -> 12015.04s]  What are you trading?
[12015.12s -> 12015.76s]  Leather.
[12015.76s -> 12016.68s]  Skins.
[12017.32s -> 12018.64s]  Fibers.
[12018.64s -> 12021.12s]  It's a small enough trade, but it serves me well.
[12021.12s -> 12023.93s]  What are they used for?
[12025.28s -> 12025.84s]  Shoes.
[12025.84s -> 12027.28s]  Clothes, I suppose.
[12027.28s -> 12028.96s]  I don't rightly care.
[12028.96s -> 12033.61s]  Have you ever been inside Mampang?
[12033.61s -> 12038.19s]  You ask, watching the curious arrangement of pulleys and ropes.
[12038.19s -> 12039.15s]  Of course I haven't.
[12040.83s -> 12042.43s]  I'm still here, aren't I?
[12042.43s -> 12044.33s]  Are you new or something?
[12044.33s -> 12046.99s]  Of course not.
[12046.99s -> 12049.80s]  The merchant continues his puzzled stare.
[12049.80s -> 12052.04s]  It says nothing else.
[12052.04s -> 12054.12s]  He edges a fraction away from you.
[12055.64s -> 12059.32s]  Have you ever seen the-
[12059.32s -> 12060.84s]  Oh, I shouldn't have said that!
[12060.84s -> 12063.60s]  Have you ever seen the Archmage?
[12063.60s -> 12067.72s]  The merchant shakes his head and smiles.
[12067.72s -> 12074.68s]  No, but I'm told he walks around Mampang once a week in his robes of power and kills anyone who does not bow.
[12074.68s -> 12077.23s]  Eh, that's just what I heard.
[12077.23s -> 12081.56s]  A hook descends near the merchant and he nods farewell before settling about,
[12081.56s -> 12083.16s]  loading his crates onto the hook.
[12083.16s -> 12085.55s]  You need to find a way through.
[12085.55s -> 12089.93s]  Over or under the wall.
[12089.93s -> 12093.26s]  Uh, I need food, so I need to go into the kitchen.
[12093.26s -> 12100.12s]  You said the wrong words with the wrong voice.
[12100.12s -> 12109.24s]  Any opportunity I get to do like the- like the crabby British guy.
[12109.24s -> 12109.72s]  You know what I mean?
[12109.72s -> 12112.36s]  Like, oh, I'll do this one right here, I'll try to avoid it.
[12112.36s -> 12117.69s]  I- I- I'm gonna do it.
[12117.69s -> 12121.58s]  Opening the door a crack, you see a riot of activity and heat.
[12121.58s -> 12125.56s]  Goblins rush between fires and low tables.
[12125.56s -> 12130.60s]  Carrying heaps of food and pots of water, an enormous hobgoblin stands at the front of the room,
[12130.60s -> 12133.48s]  shouting orders and waving a cleaver above his head.
[12133.48s -> 12136.38s]  There might be some useful information to be overheard here.
[12136.38s -> 12138.91s]  Let's stride right in.
[12139.42s -> 12142.14s]  You swing open the door trying to look like you belong.
[12142.14s -> 12143.92s]  No one pays you any attention.
[12143.92s -> 12147.12s]  The large hobgoblin burps as he stirs the soup.
[12148.44s -> 12151.84s]  All right, we're gonna go talk to the hobgoblin.
[12151.84s -> 12157.15s]  You stroll right up to the hobgoblin by the stove.
[12157.15s -> 12167.68s]  The head chef- wait, let's look around here, this is cool.
[12167.68s -> 12170.17s]  The head chef looks up to glare at you.
[12170.17s -> 12174.43s]  You see the kitchen goblin's paws, waiting with bated breath.
[12174.43s -> 12180.64s]  Most have cleavers or knives or some kind and you are quite considerably outnumbered.
[12180.64s -> 12186.97s]  No one crawls in here without my permission.
[12186.97s -> 12194.59s]  So tell me fast, why shouldn't I put you in soup?
[12194.59s -> 12198.08s]  Uh, I need some food.
[12198.08s -> 12201.98s]  The chef waves his cleaver in your face.
[12201.98s -> 12205.42s]  And you think you'll just walk in here and ask for some?
[12205.42s -> 12211.00s]  Into the kitchen of Throg, the one who serves a thousand hungry gods a day?
[12214.11s -> 12215.07s]  Indeed.
[12215.07s -> 12220.92s]  At your calm reply, Throg explodes with fury.
[12220.92s -> 12225.80s]  He rants, calling you a philistine and bemoaning those who shackle his brilliance.
[12225.80s -> 12228.91s]  He's soon red and puffing with the effort.
[12228.91s -> 12231.48s]  No, I'm just gonna- yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[12231.48s -> 12235.15s]  You nod along to his raving, trying to plot your escape.
[12235.15s -> 12240.09s]  Oh, so you are the new assistant then.
[12240.09s -> 12242.28s]  Why didn't you say so?
[12242.28s -> 12244.20s]  You frown, puzzled.
[12244.20s -> 12247.60s]  You must have nodded at the wrong time.
[12247.60s -> 12248.56s]  Uh, not again.
[12250.46s -> 12252.64s]  Better to make soup than end up in it.
[12252.64s -> 12255.53s]  Throg is already turning around.
[12255.53s -> 12257.37s]  I see, philc.
[12257.37s -> 12259.74s]  She'll get you strolled.
[12259.74s -> 12261.10s]  With that, he turns away.
[12261.10s -> 12268.65s]  Should I just go in here?
[12272.92s -> 12273.98s]  Run.
[12273.98s -> 12277.50s]  Yeah, running I think would be the- a bad- remember, there's no rewinds.
[12277.50s -> 12281.77s]  So I- we can't really make more than one decision here.
[12281.77s -> 12283.31s]  No rewinding.
[12283.31s -> 12290.01s]  Walked.
[12290.01s -> 12291.05s]  Let's do this.
[12291.05s -> 12297.90s]  You make your way around to the counter to where the goblin Throg, pointed out,
[12297.90s -> 12301.18s]  is trying to lift a bag of potatoes that is almost her size.
[12301.18s -> 12305.64s]  She collapses under the weight, but scrambles out from under the bag when she sees you.
[12305.64s -> 12314.70s]  She is a gigantic- she is gigantic for a goblin, but still a head shorter than you.
[12314.70s -> 12318.88s]  Her apron is mostly stains, dirt, and a few threadbare ruffles.
[12318.88s -> 12324.17s]  I love all this- all this up here.
[12324.17s -> 12331.21s]  It's just this interesting texture on all of these illustrations.
[12331.21s -> 12333.07s]  I love it.
[12333.07s -> 12335.31s]  Okay, uh, help her up.
[12335.31s -> 12338.78s]  You reach down a hand and pull her up.
[12338.78s -> 12339.34s]  Philc!
[12339.34s -> 12343.74s]  She announces, and you realize with a sickening feeling that she is vainly trying to tidy the
[12343.74s -> 12347.34s]  thick mound of greasy hair on her head as she speaks.
[12347.34s -> 12351.07s]  Uh, hello.
[12351.07s -> 12355.28s]  You greet her and explain that you are the new assistant.
[12355.28s -> 12357.84s]  Philc is clearly impressed.
[12357.84s -> 12361.20s]  Finally, we have someone who can reach the top shelf.
[12361.20s -> 12365.92s]  But before you start, there are a few rules.
[12365.92s -> 12367.40s]  What rules?
[12367.40s -> 12369.48s]  First, never annoy Throg.
[12370.04s -> 12371.80s]  Second, don't drop anything.
[12371.80s -> 12373.64s]  Third, don't go on the ladder.
[12373.64s -> 12376.04s]  Throg is very paranoid about that.
[12376.04s -> 12380.12s]  He's convinced there are spies everywhere trying to steal his recipes.
[12380.12s -> 12383.40s]  Frankly, I'm surprised he didn't skin you the moment you walked in.
[12383.40s -> 12387.08s]  She blushes at some unknown thought.
[12387.08s -> 12391.93s]  Spies?
[12391.93s -> 12394.35s]  You ask with some interest.
[12394.35s -> 12396.27s]  Oh, I don't think they're real.
[12396.27s -> 12398.99s]  Who would steal old Thunderbowl's recipes?
[12398.99s -> 12401.23s]  He doesn't even use spices.
[12401.23s -> 12404.43s]  The Archmage is just as paranoid about spies as I am.
[12404.43s -> 12406.51s]  But at least he's got a reason to worry.
[12406.51s -> 12412.24s]  Philc looks at you sideways and then reaches out a tentative hand to touch yours.
[12415.40s -> 12418.04s]  He's trying really hard to make new voices.
[12418.04s -> 12421.52s]  All right, let her touch me.
[12421.52s -> 12427.04s]  You stay still and her cold, greasy goblin flesh settles on your arm.
[12427.04s -> 12428.96s]  I'm so glad you're here.
[12428.96s -> 12431.64s]  And we need to get this soup made.
[12431.64s -> 12433.24s]  Yes, we feed all the guards in the yards.
[12433.24s -> 12434.60s]  We're always busy.
[12434.60s -> 12436.28s]  You chop these vegetables and get it simmering.
[12436.28s -> 12438.44s]  I need to go grab some roach pig meat.
[12438.44s -> 12439.48s]  I'll be right back.
[12439.48s -> 12441.24s]  You can start the cooking, can't you?
[12441.24s -> 12442.27s]  She turns to go.
[12445.88s -> 12448.28s]  Of course.
[12448.28s -> 12451.16s]  Really nice to have an expert pair of hands around here.
[12451.16s -> 12454.25s]  She leaves you to your task.
[12454.25s -> 12457.93s]  Before you is a chopping board heaped with vegetables, onions, turnips, potatoes,
[12457.93s -> 12460.09s]  and a few purple orbs you don't recognize.
[12460.09s -> 12465.96s]  You will need a knife.
[12465.96s -> 12467.13s]  The knife rack.
[12467.13s -> 12471.10s]  Don't go into the ladder.
[12471.10s -> 12473.55s]  You go over to the knife rack and pull out a blade.
[12473.55s -> 12476.27s]  Two goblins across the kitchen are talking in low voices.
[12476.27s -> 12478.48s]  Look at me.
[12478.48s -> 12483.55s]  It's a bit of wood the guards prop against the tower window.
[12485.23s -> 12490.11s]  Test the knife blade.
[12490.11s -> 12492.08s]  You test the edge.
[12492.08s -> 12496.28s]  It is so dull you doubt it will cut butter.
[12496.28s -> 12500.48s]  If it's a bit of wood, how do you explain to bad men?
[12500.48s -> 12502.08s]  They're not natural.
[12504.16s -> 12505.12s]  Sharpen the knife.
[12505.12s -> 12507.08s]  There's a whetstone in the counter.
[12507.08s -> 12511.00s]  You drag the knife blade back and forth a few times until it is clean.
[12511.00s -> 12516.24s]  Okay, go back to the counter.
[12516.24s -> 12517.60s]  Then you head back over to the counter.
[12517.60s -> 12526.65s]  Phil steals a quick glance and flashes a crooked smile.
[12526.65s -> 12528.25s]  You examine the vegetables.
[12528.25s -> 12531.18s]  Several of them are rotten.
[12531.18s -> 12535.20s]  I'm told the bad men are breeding.
[12535.20s -> 12538.56s]  A third goblin hisses to the first two.
[12538.56s -> 12540.80s]  I heard they have a nest.
[12543.80s -> 12552.43s]  Chop them coarsely, finely, or throw out the rotten ones.
[12552.43s -> 12559.55s]  I think they want them in here.
[12559.55s -> 12560.19s]  It's a soup.
[12560.19s -> 12562.27s]  Yeah.
[12562.27s -> 12565.07s]  Throw out the rotten ones, but I feel like that guy's gonna come over and be like,
[12566.27s -> 12566.99s]  They're for good.
[12568.11s -> 12568.67s]  I don't know.
[12568.67s -> 12569.71s]  I think it was gonna...
[12569.71s -> 12571.15s]  I'm not gonna say anything.
[12572.68s -> 12578.24s]  You attack the pile carelessly, the polished blade sinking into some of the more rotten vegetables.
[12578.24s -> 12581.12s]  You end up with a haphazard pile of chunks and goop.
[12581.12s -> 12583.36s]  Milk walks past.
[12583.36s -> 12585.60s]  Carrying a tray of overbaked breads.
[12585.60s -> 12587.58s]  Stick them in a pot.
[12587.58s -> 12590.22s]  Once they boil, no one will care what they look like.
[12590.22s -> 12600.08s]  She offers a quick nervous smile, then is gone on another errand across the room.
[12600.08s -> 12603.02s]  Pots.
[12603.02s -> 12608.06s]  Next, you head over to the rack, where a random assortment of pots and pans hang from nasty
[12608.06s -> 12609.68s]  looking hooks.
[12609.68s -> 12615.32s]  Most are dented or cracked and have holes rusted in the bottom.
[12615.32s -> 12618.33s]  Don't be stupid.
[12618.33s -> 12620.41s]  Birdmen can't lay eggs.
[12620.41s -> 12623.16s]  Think how big they'd be.
[12623.16s -> 12625.08s]  We'd be using them to make our own...
[12629.37s -> 12630.81s]  This food sucks.
[12632.03s -> 12633.87s]  We should probably eat those.
[12633.87s -> 12635.95s]  We would make an omelet with them, wouldn't we?
[12638.16s -> 12638.96s]  Yeah.
[12638.96s -> 12641.72s]  Okay, take the rusty pot.
[12641.72s -> 12642.60s]  Take the dented pot.
[12642.60s -> 12643.56s]  Take a new pot.
[12643.56s -> 12649.71s]  This audiobook sucks.
[12650.67s -> 12651.47s]  Hey, well, guess what?
[12651.47s -> 12652.51s]  It's free.
[12652.51s -> 12654.19s]  This is a free audiobook.
[12654.19s -> 12657.69s]  And this is on the recording, too.
[12657.69s -> 12659.37s]  You are hearing me say this.
[12659.37s -> 12661.28s]  This is part of the audiobook.
[12661.28s -> 12662.88s]  This shit was free, okay?
[12662.88s -> 12668.51s]  I'm gonna take a break.
[12668.51s -> 12668.99s]  I'll be right back.
[12668.99s -> 12669.71s]  I'm gonna drink something.
[12669.71s -> 12669.95s]  Hold on.
[12669.95s -> 12673.02s]  Give me a minute.
[12673.02s -> 12674.22s]  No, don't edit this out.
[12674.22s -> 12676.01s]  Keep it in.
[12676.01s -> 12676.49s]  Keep it in.
[12678.38s -> 12682.91s]  Take the rusty pot.
[12682.91s -> 12684.11s]  Take the dented pot.
[12684.11s -> 12690.14s]  Take a new pot.
[12690.14s -> 12696.38s]  Uh, I don't know what the right answer here is.
[12696.38s -> 12698.67s]  Take the dented pot.
[12698.67s -> 12699.47s]  Okay, yeah.
[12699.47s -> 12701.39s]  You grab a surface of pot.
[12701.39s -> 12704.96s]  It's dented and old, but should hold its water.
[12704.96s -> 12705.60s]  Take it.
[12705.60s -> 12708.97s]  You heft up your pot and head over to the stove.
[12708.97s -> 12711.23s]  At the stove.
[12711.23s -> 12715.10s]  Returning back to the stove,
[12715.10s -> 12717.82s]  you fill the pot with your mangled vegetables.
[12717.82s -> 12719.76s]  You add the cleanest water you can find,
[12719.76s -> 12721.60s]  which isn't very clean,
[12721.60s -> 12723.71s]  and place it over the fire.
[12723.71s -> 12725.55s]  The group of goblins are still muttering.
[12729.23s -> 12731.79s]  You should pop through the tunnel and find out,
[12731.79s -> 12733.82s]  the third goblin says.
[12733.82s -> 12738.94s]  Oh, except there's no tunnel in the larder, of course.
[12739.02s -> 12741.34s]  Rumor is totally false.
[12741.34s -> 12745.95s]  Stir.
[12745.95s -> 12747.47s]  You stir carefully,
[12747.47s -> 12750.43s]  allowing yourself to relax for a moment as you take in the aroma.
[12750.43s -> 12753.05s]  It is an oddly calming moment,
[12753.05s -> 12757.45s]  but then your reverie is broken by filch.
[12757.45s -> 12760.92s]  Returning and dumping roach pig meat into the mix.
[12760.92s -> 12762.68s]  Hot water splashes up.
[12762.68s -> 12764.59s]  She looks disappointed.
[12764.59s -> 12767.31s]  Well, it's soup, I suppose.
[12768.11s -> 12770.03s]  We should add some more flavor.
[12770.03s -> 12771.87s]  There are spices over there.
[12771.87s -> 12773.74s]  Go look.
[12773.74s -> 12775.26s]  You fucking wanker.
[12775.26s -> 12777.56s]  She hurries away once more.
[12777.56s -> 12789.63s]  The spices are kept in boxes at the back of the room.
[12789.63s -> 12791.58s]  All the herbs are from Xamen,
[12791.58s -> 12793.66s]  and you don't recognize a single one.
[12793.66s -> 12801.60s]  Okay, read the labels.
[12801.60s -> 12803.63s]  Three labels stand out.
[12803.63s -> 12805.26s]  Ant powder.
[12805.26s -> 12807.64s]  Melted curios?
[12807.64s -> 12809.98s]  Curios?
[12809.98s -> 12814.20s]  Red eye tears.
[12814.20s -> 12818.57s]  What is melted curios?
[12818.57s -> 12821.61s]  Inside the jar is a solid lump of what looks like black wax.
[12821.61s -> 12823.23s]  It smells like a sewer.
[12823.23s -> 12826.33s]  From across the room, filch waves.
[12826.33s -> 12827.53s]  Not that one.
[12827.53s -> 12831.16s]  That one's for blackening the stove.
[12831.16s -> 12832.36s]  Uh, okay.
[12832.36s -> 12836.65s]  Pick something else.
[12836.65s -> 12842.27s]  Uh, how about the red eye tears?
[12842.27s -> 12843.55s]  Red eye tears?
[12843.55s -> 12844.72s]  Really?
[12844.72s -> 12847.68s]  Inside the jar is a fizzing bright red liquid.
[12847.68s -> 12851.18s]  A drop on your tongue burns a little, but pleasantly.
[12851.18s -> 12853.15s]  Take it.
[12853.15s -> 12856.54s]  Hot sauce.
[12856.54s -> 12868.19s]  Grab your jar, hoping that what's inside is edible.
[12868.19s -> 12869.71s]  You take your jar back to filch.
[12869.71s -> 12872.91s]  She squints at the label, then smiles.
[12872.91s -> 12874.67s]  That's an interesting choice.
[12874.67s -> 12880.94s]  Empty the jar of spice into the pot, or give the jar to filch.
[12880.94s -> 12888.62s]  We're just gonna dump the whole thing in?
[12888.62s -> 12894.89s]  Empty the jar of spice into the pot.
[12894.89s -> 12897.93s]  You pour some into the pot, and filch watches.
[12897.93s -> 12901.47s]  The soup bubbles and churns.
[12901.47s -> 12907.40s]  Is the bird man somebody else's talking?
[12907.40s -> 12908.92s]  Bird men are breeding.
[12908.92s -> 12910.96s]  That means they might rebel.
[12910.96s -> 12914.60s]  The fourth goblin asks from the nearby group nervously.
[12914.60s -> 12917.96s]  The Archmage can't control creatures he doesn't make.
[12921.18s -> 12927.50s]  Summoning all of your bile, you spit into the pot with fiendish glee.
[12927.50s -> 12929.00s]  Filch grins.
[12929.00s -> 12930.84s]  Traditional goblin cuisine.
[12930.84s -> 12932.60s]  I didn't know you so worldly.
[12933.66s -> 12934.59s]  Pfft.
[12934.59s -> 12936.54s]  She spits alongside you.
[12936.54s -> 12941.10s]  Your two phlegm streaks mingle into one spiraling galaxy of mucus,
[12941.10s -> 12943.18s]  before being lost from view.
[12943.18s -> 12945.32s]  That is disgusting.
[12945.32s -> 12950.04s]  Should I taste it?
[12950.04s -> 12957.79s]  You lift a spoonful and take a taste.
[12957.79s -> 12959.79s]  It's surprisingly palatable.
[12959.79s -> 12961.58s]  You stir the broth.
[12961.58s -> 12964.36s]  Excellent smells rise up from its surface.
[12964.36s -> 12967.88s]  At filch's insistence, Grog comes over to sniff the pot.
[12969.45s -> 12970.17s]  Not bad.
[12971.44s -> 12974.28s]  What's in it?
[12974.28s -> 12975.08s]  Roach pig?
[12975.08s -> 12977.80s]  The finest turnips?
[12977.80s -> 12978.92s]  Whatever I could find.
[12979.00s -> 12986.94s]  I mean, these are both true, but this is accurate.
[12986.94s -> 12989.64s]  Whatever I could find.
[12989.64s -> 12991.71s]  Whatever I could find.
[12991.71s -> 12996.56s]  Grog smacks filch across the back of the head in reply.
[12996.56s -> 12997.36s]  Like, what?
[12997.36s -> 13001.20s]  Grog takes a spoon and sips carefully.
[13001.20s -> 13004.52s]  Then he beams with pleasure.
[13004.52s -> 13005.56s]  Delightful.
[13006.44s -> 13008.76s]  Oh, come around, you lumps.
[13008.76s -> 13009.48s]  Hey, come here.
[13010.04s -> 13011.00s]  Oh, now.
[13011.64s -> 13013.13s]  Ow.
[13013.13s -> 13014.65s]  He gives you a hit on...
[13014.65s -> 13016.49s]  I don't need to read it.
[13016.49s -> 13017.21s]  You heard it.
[13017.21s -> 13018.01s]  I just did it.
[13018.01s -> 13019.56s]  I pantomimed it.
[13019.56s -> 13022.70s]  Now, this is a chef.
[13022.70s -> 13025.93s]  He's going places, you hear?
[13025.93s -> 13027.07s]  Ow.
[13027.07s -> 13028.99s]  You try to look suitably humble.
[13028.99s -> 13032.36s]  Someone take this to the mess hall.
[13032.36s -> 13036.22s]  And you, you get access to the good ingredients.
[13037.92s -> 13039.60s]  Go check out the larder.
[13039.60s -> 13041.20s]  It's full of real meat.
[13041.20s -> 13044.83s]  Trying not to think about what he means by real meat,
[13044.83s -> 13049.48s]  you head towards the larder.
[13049.48s -> 13050.36s]  We're allowed in.
[13050.36s -> 13051.32s]  This is big.
[13051.32s -> 13055.88s]  You open the door and slip into the larder.
[13055.88s -> 13058.89s]  It is stocked with food that looks actually edible,
[13058.89s -> 13061.21s]  unlike most of what is piled in the kitchen.
[13061.21s -> 13064.09s]  But there doesn't seem to be much more to it,
[13064.09s -> 13067.05s]  except that you were told that somewhere in here
[13067.05s -> 13069.85s]  is a secret passage into the heart of the fortress.
[13069.85s -> 13073.32s]  The door behind you opens and Philk slips in,
[13073.32s -> 13074.68s]  somewhat breathlessly.
[13074.68s -> 13077.76s]  I thought I could help.
[13081.31s -> 13082.72s]  Hmm.
[13082.72s -> 13084.03s]  Unlikely.
[13084.03s -> 13086.35s]  I heard there was a tunnel in here.
[13086.35s -> 13090.25s]  This affair has gone far enough.
[13090.25s -> 13091.93s]  I heard there was a tunnel in here.
[13091.93s -> 13097.58s]  This is giving it away.
[13097.58s -> 13102.41s]  I'm going to say it.
[13102.41s -> 13104.01s]  I heard there was a tunnel in here.
[13104.01s -> 13112.46s]  A tunnel into the fortress?
[13112.46s -> 13114.84s]  Is it true?
[13114.84s -> 13117.18s]  I've never heard of a tunnel.
[13117.18s -> 13120.86s]  But if it was true, why aren't people coming through?
[13120.86s -> 13125.44s]  Perhaps no one knows.
[13125.44s -> 13127.60s]  Yeah, they're like rats in there.
[13127.60s -> 13132.41s]  Rats always know when there are tunnels.
[13132.41s -> 13147.36s]  Enough talk.
[13147.36s -> 13150.57s]  You turn, ignoring the gobliness once more,
[13150.57s -> 13151.95s]  but she seems content.
[13151.95s -> 13155.32s]  She comes to stand beside you.
[13155.32s -> 13160.24s]  So, what shall we do next?
[13160.24s -> 13161.36s]  Tap the walls and inspect.
[13161.36s -> 13162.48s]  There's a lot of things here.
[13162.48s -> 13162.80s]  Take some...
[13162.80s -> 13164.25s]  Ooh, hold on.
[13164.25s -> 13165.29s]  Take some rations.
[13165.29s -> 13171.21s]  You were warned on your travels not to eat from the larder of Throg,
[13171.21s -> 13173.29s]  but was that because it would anger Throg
[13173.37s -> 13177.55s]  or because the food was somehow tainted?
[13177.55s -> 13178.11s]  Hmm.
[13178.11s -> 13184.75s]  Should I try it?
[13184.75s -> 13185.23s]  Okay.
[13185.23s -> 13185.71s]  I'll leave it.
[13185.71s -> 13186.27s]  Leave it, leave it.
[13186.27s -> 13187.44s]  Yep, yep, yep.
[13187.44s -> 13189.04s]  You leave the food on the shelves untouched.
[13189.04s -> 13190.80s]  Better not to risk it, whatever it might be.
[13190.80s -> 13193.05s]  So, what do you think it is?
[13193.05s -> 13195.26s]  It's a tunnel.
[13195.26s -> 13195.98s]  Ah.
[13195.98s -> 13199.39s]  What about ingredients?
[13199.39s -> 13202.59s]  Look on the shelves.
[13202.59s -> 13204.32s]  Search around the shelves
[13204.32s -> 13206.48s]  and come across an interesting old cloth bag
[13206.48s -> 13208.16s]  that rattles when you pick it up.
[13208.16s -> 13212.01s]  There's probably a fucking snake in here.
[13212.01s -> 13214.09s]  I'm putting it back.
[13214.09s -> 13218.54s]  There's no rewind, so I'm actually kind of scared of this.
[13218.54s -> 13224.17s]  Is there like a rattlesnake in there?
[13224.17s -> 13226.27s]  I'm gonna...
[13226.27s -> 13227.07s]  I'm...
[13227.07s -> 13227.39s]  I can't.
[13227.39s -> 13227.79s]  I don't know.
[13227.79s -> 13230.52s]  I don't know.
[13230.52s -> 13232.60s]  What should I get from here is good.
[13232.60s -> 13234.40s]  What should I get from here?
[13234.40s -> 13236.76s]  You ask Vilk.
[13236.76s -> 13237.80s]  What would you like?
[13237.80s -> 13240.28s]  That doesn't help.
[13240.28s -> 13249.63s]  Search around the sacks.
[13249.63s -> 13252.27s]  You move some sacks to get better access to the far wall,
[13252.27s -> 13254.01s]  but it is solid stone.
[13254.01s -> 13256.60s]  But as you're pushing them aside,
[13256.60s -> 13259.08s]  you realize the sacks are stacked very oddly.
[13259.08s -> 13263.74s]  A patch of floor right next to the teetering stack is bare.
[13263.74s -> 13268.12s]  Whoever stacked them avoided a single spot.
[13268.12s -> 13269.63s]  What is it?
[13269.63s -> 13270.75s]  Have you seen something?
[13270.75s -> 13274.43s]  Look at the spot.
[13274.43s -> 13277.07s]  Inspecting carefully,
[13277.07s -> 13280.03s]  you notice a thin seam running across some floorboards.
[13280.03s -> 13283.02s]  A less clever observer would never have noticed it.
[13283.02s -> 13285.82s]  You pick up a nearby fork and pry at the seam.
[13285.82s -> 13290.49s]  A section of floor pops up on disguised hinges.
[13290.49s -> 13291.29s]  A trapdoor!
[13294.01s -> 13295.05s]  Where does it lead?
[13295.05s -> 13297.05s]  Where does it lead?
[13297.05s -> 13297.85s]  You ask her.
[13297.85s -> 13300.03s]  I have no idea.
[13300.03s -> 13301.07s]  Inside the city?
[13301.07s -> 13307.21s]  Look down the trapdoor.
[13307.21s -> 13309.45s]  You peer down into the darkness below the kitchen.
[13309.45s -> 13311.53s]  A chill breeze is rushing along the tunnel.
[13311.53s -> 13314.89s]  It must go for some distance.
[13314.89s -> 13319.64s]  It really is a channel under the wall.
[13319.64s -> 13324.70s]  Do you want to come?
[13324.70s -> 13326.04s]  Inside?
[13326.04s -> 13327.88s]  They're all mad inside the walls.
[13328.52s -> 13338.65s]  I won't even be able to sleep again knowing that's here.
[13338.65s -> 13340.89s]  Bilk is tense as you peer down into the hole.
[13340.89s -> 13347.05s]  You could turn back or descend below.
[13347.05s -> 13351.04s]  Well, this is interesting because if we go back,
[13351.04s -> 13354.09s]  we'll head out this way and head here.
[13354.09s -> 13360.06s]  But this tunnel, if we don't die a horrible death somehow,
[13360.06s -> 13363.63s]  we will end up up here and then probably out this way.
[13363.63s -> 13367.84s]  What do you guys want to do?
[13367.84s -> 13373.66s]  Secret tunnel or main entrance?
[13373.74s -> 13375.58s]  I mean, do we even need to do a poll?
[13375.58s -> 13376.70s]  I feel like everyone's going to say tunnel.
[13383.12s -> 13383.92s]  It's going to be like 90%.
[13384.88s -> 13388.72s]  Okay, we'll go to another tunnel.
[13388.72s -> 13390.54s]  You worked for this.
[13390.54s -> 13391.18s]  Yeah, I did.
[13391.18s -> 13396.88s]  You climb downwards into the tunnel, squinting in the dim light.
[13396.88s -> 13400.76s]  It's narrow, but there doesn't seem to be anyone in it.
[13400.76s -> 13402.65s]  Are you really going?
[13402.65s -> 13404.09s]  Bilk whispers from above.
[13404.09s -> 13406.00s]  Come with me.
[13406.00s -> 13407.95s]  I have to.
[13407.95s -> 13409.07s]  Why would I stay?
[13409.07s -> 13411.32s]  Goodbye, Bilk.
[13411.32s -> 13414.20s]  Come with me.
[13414.20s -> 13416.44s]  She seems to consider your offer for a moment,
[13416.44s -> 13418.76s]  then she shakes her head.
[13418.76s -> 13420.84s]  I can't come with you.
[13420.84s -> 13422.12s]  Look at that tunnel.
[13422.12s -> 13424.25s]  I won't fit.
[13424.25s -> 13425.37s]  Isn't there another way?
[13428.03s -> 13431.36s]  Uh, I need to...
[13431.36s -> 13433.61s]  I'll come back for you.
[13433.61s -> 13438.80s]  I'll come back for you.
[13438.80s -> 13440.16s]  I'll come back for you.
[13440.16s -> 13442.80s]  You promise, but she shakes her head, not believing.
[13442.80s -> 13444.75s]  Goodbye.
[13444.75s -> 13449.53s]  I hope you find whatever it is you're looking for.
[13449.53s -> 13452.64s]  With that, she closes the trap door over your head.
[13452.64s -> 13457.47s]  You hear the scrape as a flower bag is shifted on top of it
[13457.47s -> 13459.63s]  and the distant wail of tears.
[13459.63s -> 13463.68s]  There's no turning back now.
[13463.68s -> 13471.18s]  No.
[13471.18s -> 13472.38s]  Okay, let's go.
[13472.38s -> 13480.00s]  You slither and slide your way down into the darkness of the tunnel.
[13480.00s -> 13482.25s]  It is unclear who built this.
[13482.25s -> 13485.53s]  There are no supports or indications of construction.
[13485.53s -> 13490.91s]  There seem to be tooth marks in the walls.
[13490.91s -> 13493.88s]  Scramble onwards.
[13493.88s -> 13495.80s]  You splash on through the shallow water.
[13495.80s -> 13502.14s]  The rock walls drip with dank moss and the smell is stale and fetid.
[13502.14s -> 13506.08s]  There's no way to tell how much more of this there is to go.
[13506.08s -> 13510.08s]  Scramble onwards.
[13510.08s -> 13513.47s]  You splash onwards.
[13513.47s -> 13517.15s]  The tunnel turns a corner here, rising upwards towards a chink of light.
[13517.15s -> 13520.91s]  Around the corner.
[13520.91s -> 13526.83s]  You climb upwards using the rough edge of the tunnel as footholds to ascend.
[13526.83s -> 13529.92s]  There is a fresh scent from somewhere overhead.
[13529.92s -> 13533.88s]  Keep climbing.
[13533.88s -> 13536.92s]  After some more clamoring, you come within sight of a grate in the ceiling.
[13536.92s -> 13542.94s]  Light filters through and standing right on top of it are a pair of feet.
[13542.94s -> 13545.84s]  Uh, let's see.
[13545.84s -> 13547.52s]  I'm gonna listen.
[13547.52s -> 13554.01s]  You wait a few seconds and are rewarded as the guards above begin to chatter.
[13554.01s -> 13555.96s]  I'm bored.
[13555.96s -> 13557.72s]  Silence! Guards don't talk!
[13557.72s -> 13559.98s]  But what are we guarding?
[13559.98s -> 13563.31s]  I don't know, but this spot's always been guarded, so we're guarding it!
[13563.31s -> 13569.18s]  Even if nothing ever happens here!
[13569.18s -> 13570.54s]  Uh, one cast.
[13570.54s -> 13573.64s]  What can I do?
[13573.64s -> 13578.62s]  You need to fart box the room.
[13578.62s -> 13580.06s]  Uh, I could just zap.
[13580.06s -> 13582.22s]  No, that would just, that would cause mayhem.
[13585.64s -> 13586.44s]  Dumb.
[13586.44s -> 13593.37s]  How much health do I have?
[13593.37s -> 13594.33s]  Oh my god.
[13600.72s -> 13602.40s]  This is, this is gonna be a problem.
[13604.73s -> 13609.02s]  I'm trying to stay undetected.
[13609.02s -> 13610.14s]  Create illusions.
[13610.14s -> 13612.14s]  Ooh, let's do that.
[13616.54s -> 13620.22s]  Reaching up to the stars, you create the magic, and the bracelet at your wrist begins to glow.
[13620.94s -> 13623.82s]  You have just a moment in which to choose your illusion.
[13623.82s -> 13628.32s]  You find the guards' mind nearby, ready to be deceived by an illusion.
[13628.32s -> 13631.20s]  Swarm of rats?
[13631.20s -> 13644.97s]  Set the grate on fire or release a poison gas.
[13644.97s -> 13646.94s]  Uh, let's do rats.
[13646.94s -> 13648.40s]  Rats are gas.
[13648.40s -> 13650.36s]  Yeah, rats.
[13650.36s -> 13656.16s]  You unleash a swarm of rats that scurry up through the grate and surround the guards' ankles.
[13656.16s -> 13656.88s]  Crip, quick!
[13657.60s -> 13658.80s]  We have to get away from here!
[13658.80s -> 13660.32s]  Come on, quickly, there's rats!
[13660.32s -> 13661.76s]  You hear their footsteps running away.
[13662.83s -> 13666.03s]  More light filters down from above now that the guards above have gone.
[13666.03s -> 13668.88s]  Quick, we have to get out of here!
[13668.88s -> 13671.61s]  Come, quickly!
[13671.61s -> 13674.04s]  Are they still there?
[13674.04s -> 13676.38s]  Okay, so they're gone.
[13676.38s -> 13678.14s]  So if I press on...
[13678.14s -> 13679.55s]  Can I press on?
[13679.55s -> 13683.07s]  You push on through the tunnel further underneath Manpeng.
[13683.07s -> 13684.43s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, I wanted to...
[13684.43s -> 13687.12s]  Oh, shit!
[13687.12s -> 13690.52s]  I wanted to, like, put, like, press on.
[13690.52s -> 13691.24s]  Oh.
[13691.24s -> 13698.01s]  Because what, couldn't I have come, like, uh, couldn't I have gone through the grate up here?
[13698.01s -> 13701.53s]  Like, there's no, there's no rewinding.
[13701.53s -> 13704.03s]  It's okay.
[13704.03s -> 13705.79s]  You might not actually have been able to do that.
[13705.79s -> 13709.12s]  You reach the end of the tunnel.
[13709.12s -> 13715.95s]  A short flight of slick stone steps leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling.
[13715.95s -> 13717.07s]  Look at the trapdoor.
[13717.07s -> 13722.03s]  The trapdoor is set neatly into the rocky ceiling and is closed tight.
[13722.03s -> 13725.63s]  It looks as though it is, hasn't really been open for a very long time.
[13725.63s -> 13728.84s]  Can I open it?
[13728.84s -> 13732.52s]  You scramble quickly upwards, keen to get out of the tunnel as quickly as possible.
[13732.52s -> 13739.39s]  But the trapdoor, when you reach it, is so firmly locked, it does not even shiver when you shove at it.
[13739.39s -> 13740.91s]  Uh, this is what DOP is for.
[13740.91s -> 13752.14s]  We can do it.
[13752.14s -> 13752.86s]  Should work, right?
[13755.74s -> 13761.80s]  Yawb is an amazing idea, but we will absolutely alert the Archmage that I'm here.
[13762.36s -> 13770.01s]  You weave the constellations into a pattern around you, but nothing happens.
[13770.01s -> 13772.16s]  The trapdoor does not even shake.
[13772.16s -> 13775.32s]  Perhaps it is protected by some magical defense?
[13775.32s -> 13777.98s]  Or else, it is not a door at all.
[13777.98s -> 13782.27s]  You bang on the trapdoor.
[13782.27s -> 13784.19s]  It doesn't budge, not even slightly.
[13784.19s -> 13786.59s]  More suspiciously, it barely even booms.
[13786.59s -> 13789.92s]  Pull at the wood.
[13789.92s -> 13793.92s]  Pull at the wood of the trapdoor, and after some work with the chopping knife,
[13793.92s -> 13797.58s]  a strip falls away, revealing smooth rock beneath.
[13797.58s -> 13802.19s]  It seems this was once a trapdoor, but it has since been filled in,
[13802.19s -> 13807.79s]  perhaps with a petrification spell, cast onto the wood itself.
[13807.79s -> 13808.51s]  Oh.
[13808.51s -> 13811.80s]  There's no way up from the tunnel, it seems.
[13811.80s -> 13815.16s]  You turn back hopelessly towards the thin light from the grate.
[13815.16s -> 13816.94s]  What?
[13816.94s -> 13822.78s]  You return along the tunnel when you hear something growling.
[13822.78s -> 13825.58s]  It seems your banging has attracted attention.
[13825.58s -> 13828.92s]  Oh god.
[13828.92s -> 13830.68s]  You stop to listen.
[13830.68s -> 13832.28s]  The sound is all too familiar.
[13832.28s -> 13834.65s]  It's the yawning growl of a rat bear.
[13834.65s -> 13846.83s]  The sound is getting closer.
[13846.83s -> 13848.03s]  Uh, create glue.
[13851.29s -> 13851.85s]  A jig.
[13853.79s -> 13857.69s]  Uh, pot.
[13860.60s -> 13861.56s]  No zip.
[13861.56s -> 13866.54s]  Let's do it.
[13866.54s -> 13875.74s]  You cast the enchantment, pulling out your bamboo flute and starting to play.
[13875.74s -> 13878.06s]  For a moment, it seems like it is having no effect.
[13878.62s -> 13882.22s]  The rat bear lashes at you with its tail and claws,
[13882.22s -> 13886.75s]  but then you notice that the attacks are rhythmic and symmetric.
[13886.75s -> 13888.54s]  The creature is dancing.
[13888.54s -> 13891.74s]  Nasty, spiky dancing that would kill anyone who came too close.
[13891.74s -> 13893.88s]  But dancing nonetheless.
[13893.88s -> 13897.52s]  It is unclear how this will help you, however.
[13897.52s -> 13899.12s]  Uh, let's go down the tunnel.
[13899.12s -> 13902.25s]  You lead the rat bear a short way along the tunnel.
[13902.25s -> 13906.81s]  It splashes and twists in the water, making strange shapes and movements with its tail.
[13906.81s -> 13911.32s]  Keep playing, keep playing, keep playing.
[13911.32s -> 13913.32s]  You keep playing, hoping to wear the creature out.
[13913.32s -> 13914.28s]  Perhaps it is working.
[13914.28s -> 13915.58s]  It is hard to tell.
[13915.58s -> 13918.22s]  You finish your playing and lower the pipe from your lips.
[13918.22s -> 13922.94s]  The rat bear ceases its dance and looks at you through narrow animal eyes.
[13922.94s -> 13929.66s]  Then it bows its head, turns, and disappears down the passage into the dark.
[13929.66s -> 13931.50s]  You stop to recover your breath.
[13931.50s -> 13935.98s]  But though you are alive, you're still stuck down in the dark.
[13935.98s -> 13946.30s]  I was thinking I could bring him down the hallway and have him attack the door.
[13946.30s -> 13948.38s]  Okay, I think we have to go giant here.
[13948.38s -> 13952.19s]  Oh wait, no, shit.
[13952.19s -> 13953.63s]  Yeah, let's just do it.
[13953.63s -> 13954.19s]  Fuck it.
[13954.19s -> 13956.83s]  Let's just go for it.
[13956.83s -> 13964.16s]  Shit!
[13967.48s -> 13972.12s]  The archmage is on the toilet right now and his whole fortress just shook.
[13972.12s -> 13974.89s]  What in the hell was that?
[13974.89s -> 13976.76s]  What was that?
[13976.76s -> 13981.00s]  You pull the giant's tooth from your pack and throw it on the ground,
[13981.00s -> 13982.44s]  casting your spell across it.
[13982.44s -> 13986.91s]  The tooth erupts into a column of smoke from which a towering giant steps out.
[13988.00s -> 13990.48s]  The giant does not fit in the tunnel.
[13990.48s -> 13994.72s]  And once it appears, it fills the tunnel entirely, grumbling.
[13994.72s -> 13998.40s]  One elbow squashes up against the grate and it flips open.
[13998.40s -> 14006.27s]  Moments before the giant pops out of existence once more.
[14006.27s -> 14007.47s]  All right, let's get the hell out of here.
[14007.47s -> 14008.75s]  Hold on, look up at it yet.
[14009.31s -> 14011.10s]  It's just, okay, it's open.
[14011.10s -> 14012.80s]  Listen, anybody there?
[14012.80s -> 14013.60s]  Nobody there?
[14013.60s -> 14015.96s]  Let's go.
[14015.96s -> 14019.87s]  You jump to try and grab the overhead grate, but you cannot reach it.
[14019.87s -> 14023.02s]  Probably float up there.
[14024.65s -> 14025.69s]  It was already open?
[14026.49s -> 14030.19s]  Wait, the grate was open already.
[14035.00s -> 14035.80s]  Oh goodness.
[14037.60s -> 14040.28s]  Uh, so just...
[14041.47s -> 14041.97s]  What?
[14044.22s -> 14046.46s]  What is Zob?
[14046.46s -> 14047.50s]  I've never heard of Zob.
[14053.87s -> 14054.37s]  Gak.
[14058.01s -> 14059.13s]  I can't float up there.
[14059.13s -> 14059.77s]  I can't reach it.
[14060.41s -> 14063.56s]  Try someone, another giant.
[14064.60s -> 14066.12s]  Someone, a second giant.
[14075.88s -> 14076.92s]  Replica creature.
[14078.84s -> 14079.64s]  Illusion.
[14079.64s -> 14080.52s]  I just need to get out.
[14085.96s -> 14086.92s]  Like, how do I get out of here?
[14091.28s -> 14094.40s]  Looking, you cast the spell, but the grate is already open.
[14094.40s -> 14095.12s]  Okay, so wait.
[14095.68s -> 14096.88s]  You settle down to wait.
[14097.44s -> 14099.88s]  There seems to be nothing else you can do.
[14100.84s -> 14102.12s]  Hours pass.
[14102.12s -> 14105.13s]  Then you hear a distant rumbling noise.
[14105.13s -> 14109.31s]  What about Zen?
[14109.31s -> 14111.28s]  I think all I had was Zap, right?
[14111.28s -> 14114.59s]  Did I, was Zen available?
[14114.59s -> 14115.71s]  I thought it was just Zap.
[14115.71s -> 14116.99s]  It was, it was Z-E-N.
[14116.99s -> 14122.30s]  It wasn't, it wasn't just Z-A, really?
[14122.30s -> 14127.48s]  I didn't see Zen.
[14127.48s -> 14128.76s]  You had, I had Zen.
[14128.76s -> 14129.72s]  I thought it was just Zap.
[14130.36s -> 14131.64s]  Okay, well, I'm gonna brace myself there.
[14132.28s -> 14135.60s]  You brace yourself fairly certain what is coming.
[14135.60s -> 14136.48s]  Water.
[14136.48s -> 14139.44s]  A high, heavy torrent of water that fills the tunnel.
[14139.44s -> 14141.44s]  You have moments before it strikes.
[14143.52s -> 14147.04s]  You fill your lungs, then the wall of water strikes,
[14147.04s -> 14148.96s]  thumping hard into your body.
[14148.96s -> 14152.70s]  The world is turned upside down and you cannot see for rising bubbles.
[14152.70s -> 14157.15s]  You are only held in place by clinging onto the hole in the ceiling.
[14157.15s -> 14159.87s]  Thank God I did this first.
[14159.87s -> 14161.07s]  Pull myself up.
[14161.07s -> 14165.88s]  As the water rises, you grab onto the open grate and haul yourself upwards,
[14165.88s -> 14167.77s]  fighting hard against the current.
[14167.77s -> 14168.96s]  Keep pulling.
[14168.96s -> 14171.36s]  You keep pulling, hauling yourself towards the hatch.
[14171.36s -> 14175.16s]  Things brush past your body, washed away by the current.
[14175.16s -> 14176.97s]  Climb out.
[14176.97s -> 14179.15s]  Nice.
[14179.15s -> 14182.28s]  After more heaving, you manage to pull yourself out through the grate.
[14182.28s -> 14185.90s]  Once your legs are out of the water, getting free of the tunnel is easier.
[14185.90s -> 14188.94s]  Of course, all of your water-damageable possessions have been ruined,
[14188.94s -> 14192.01s]  including the goblin's precious parchment.
[14192.01s -> 14192.81s]  Oh, great.
[14192.81s -> 14195.34s]  Thank, wait, is that bad?
[14195.34s -> 14197.90s]  Thankfully, however, the pages of your spellbook are protected,
[14197.90s -> 14199.90s]  but all of your soft food has been ruined.
[14199.90s -> 14205.05s]  That's fantastic.
[14205.05s -> 14208.68s]  Out of the tunnel.
[14208.68s -> 14213.20s]  You step out onto the dirt of Mampang and kick the grate shut behind you.
[14213.20s -> 14216.92s]  You try to shake the water from your cloak.
[14216.92s -> 14219.80s]  You are in a narrow alley between two large buildings.
[14219.80s -> 14223.63s]  At the far end, you can see a glimpse of some kind of plaza.
[14223.63s -> 14226.03s]  The wind picks up as the evening draws on.
[14226.03s -> 14227.15s]  Soon it'll be dark.
[14227.15s -> 14227.87s]  Once more.
[14227.87s -> 14229.64s]  You slip your way forwards.
[14229.64s -> 14237.79s]  This is where we ended up.
[14237.79s -> 14241.80s]  Along the alley.
[14241.80s -> 14245.18s]  There is barely enough space to walk between the two buildings,
[14245.18s -> 14249.10s]  which list inwards on both sides.
[14249.10s -> 14251.32s]  Look at the buildings.
[14251.32s -> 14255.24s]  The buildings on both sides are topped by large glass domes.
[14255.24s -> 14257.48s]  The one on the right larger than that on the left.
[14257.48s -> 14260.28s]  You slide onwards down the alleyway.
[14260.28s -> 14271.88s]  The alley widens out a little here.
[14271.88s -> 14273.48s]  As it approaches the square at the end.
[14273.48s -> 14275.61s]  You are inside the city.
[14275.61s -> 14277.05s]  Time to explore.
[14277.05s -> 14280.41s]  Looking around, you are surprised to find that this part of Mampang
[14280.41s -> 14282.65s]  is more like a city than you expected.
[14282.65s -> 14286.27s]  There are merchants, laborers, and swaggering guards.
[14286.27s -> 14289.68s]  Washing hangs from hooks outside the stacked houses.
[14289.68s -> 14292.64s]  Of course, there are far more wicked glares and knives
[14292.64s -> 14295.31s]  tucked into belts than even in Kare.
[14295.31s -> 14298.43s]  Suddenly you feel hooked fingers catch your arm.
[14298.43s -> 14302.48s]  Turn around.
[14302.48s -> 14307.16s]  You turn around and catch a glimpse of a hoary old beggar.
[14307.16s -> 14308.60s]  Pulling at you.
[14308.60s -> 14311.21s]  But then something happens and you lose sight of him.
[14311.21s -> 14316.56s]  A moment later the tall buildings of Mampang that you traveled so far to reach
[14316.56s -> 14317.60s]  have disappeared.
[14317.60s -> 14327.08s]  You stand in a humid climate.
[14327.08s -> 14330.62s]  Tall plants lean down on all sides.
[14330.62s -> 14334.30s]  And a thin, watery sunlight leaks through some kind of glass ceiling.
[14334.30s -> 14335.93s]  Choked with weeds.
[14335.93s -> 14338.54s]  Libra?
[14338.54s -> 14341.00s]  But there is no sign of the goddess.
[14341.00s -> 14343.64s]  The beggar is still here, however.
[14343.64s -> 14345.24s]  But no longer holding your arm.
[14345.24s -> 14350.56s]  He stands taller and seems better fed.
[14350.56s -> 14351.36s]  That's better.
[14352.32s -> 14354.00s]  Now we can talk more freely.
[14354.00s -> 14358.38s]  What have you done?
[14358.38s -> 14359.42s]  Moved us elsewhere.
[14360.14s -> 14362.14s]  This is a favorite little spot of mine.
[14362.14s -> 14364.30s]  A forgotten corner of Kare.
[14364.30s -> 14366.64s]  The lost gardens of Braia.
[14366.64s -> 14369.98s]  Even the gardeners who work here can't remember the way in.
[14369.98s -> 14373.21s]  It's on all the maps, but no one can find the entrance.
[14373.21s -> 14375.44s]  My own little fortress.
[14375.44s -> 14379.44s]  He reaches rather tenderly for a nearby plant and pulls off a graying leaf.
[14379.44s -> 14382.99s]  Who are you?
[14382.99s -> 14384.27s]  My name is Throban.
[14384.27s -> 14386.73s]  The beggar bows most politely.
[14386.73s -> 14389.69s]  You notice he wears a circlet of finger bones on his hand.
[14389.69s -> 14391.74s]  On his head.
[14391.74s -> 14394.06s]  Some have called me necromancer.
[14394.06s -> 14399.45s]  They only mean that death has never stopped my work.
[14399.45s -> 14403.02s]  Uh, you're dead?
[14403.02s -> 14404.14s]  Sometimes.
[14404.14s -> 14405.34s]  Not entirely.
[14405.34s -> 14408.78s]  Though I rather think I soon will be.
[14408.78s -> 14413.37s]  Well, soon can be confusing, of course.
[14413.37s -> 14415.21s]  Perhaps we should start from the beginning.
[14415.21s -> 14417.42s]  Throban smiles.
[14417.42s -> 14418.86s]  Come, let's take a walk, shall we?
[14418.86s -> 14424.01s]  He begins to saunter between the trees, and you follow.
[14424.01s -> 14426.09s]  This place is hidden from the Archmage?
[14426.09s -> 14428.12s]  You observe.
[14428.12s -> 14429.80s]  Quite so, quite so.
[14429.80s -> 14435.64s]  The Archmage would chew a death sponge mushroom and then eat my brains if he had the chance.
[14435.64s -> 14441.10s]  But for us all, it's best if that doesn't happen.
[14441.10s -> 14442.62s]  I must return to Mampang.
[14442.62s -> 14445.44s]  I have a mission.
[14445.44s -> 14447.79s]  Of great importance, I know, I know, I know.
[14447.79s -> 14450.51s]  But I must tell you, if you attempt your mission, you will die.
[14452.78s -> 14454.62s]  I must take that risk.
[14454.62s -> 14457.66s]  Perhaps you could try to understand it first.
[14457.66s -> 14461.39s]  He replies with a slight sigh.
[14461.39s -> 14465.36s]  In Mampang, death can be quite final.
[14465.36s -> 14467.84s]  The reach of the gods is limited there.
[14467.84s -> 14471.20s]  There's not always a way out, and you will die.
[14471.20s -> 14474.52s]  Throban points at a nearby flower.
[14474.52s -> 14476.24s]  Do you see this one?
[14476.24s -> 14477.52s]  Purple thornweed.
[14477.52s -> 14479.28s]  Only grows in one place.
[14479.28s -> 14481.52s]  The slopes above my home village.
[14481.52s -> 14486.03s]  It's very nice.
[14486.03s -> 14486.59s]  It was.
[14487.31s -> 14489.95s]  I grew up in the same village as the Archmage, you know.
[14489.95s -> 14493.12s]  Small place called Kariama.
[14493.12s -> 14494.08s]  Kariama.
[14494.08s -> 14497.08s]  Maybe you've heard of it.
[14497.08s -> 14499.32s]  He sweeps away, his face hidden from view.
[14499.32s -> 14500.04s]  This way now.
[14500.04s -> 14500.44s]  Follow me.
[14500.44s -> 14501.08s]  Come on.
[14501.08s -> 14504.01s]  He steps between two plants and disappears.
[14504.01s -> 14507.66s]  Where is this on the map?
[14507.66s -> 14509.68s]  Down here in Kari.
[14510.48s -> 14511.68s]  Uh, this is the second game.
[14512.32s -> 14514.28s]  This is my favorite of the four games.
[14514.84s -> 14519.58s]  I would say if I was to do a tier list of sorcery, this would be at S tier.
[14520.14s -> 14522.99s]  This is by far some of the most fun I've ever had in a video game.
[14523.63s -> 14525.15s]  I love Kari.
[14525.15s -> 14526.67s]  There's so much to do here.
[14527.90s -> 14531.02s]  It's, there's so many funny characters, so many wacky scenarios.
[14532.67s -> 14533.71s]  It's, it's just the best.
[14534.27s -> 14537.31s]  Into the garden.
[14537.31s -> 14542.99s]  You push your way between the plants and find the beggar waiting.
[14542.99s -> 14544.75s]  Only now he is no beggar,
[14544.75s -> 14548.83s]  but a tall, handsome man wearing a long cloak embroidered with runes of power.
[14550.72s -> 14552.56s]  There you are.
[14552.56s -> 14554.48s]  I was told to expect you.
[14554.48s -> 14559.26s]  Where's the old man?
[14559.26s -> 14560.70s]  Safely in my future.
[14561.84s -> 14563.60s]  Please excuse any confusion.
[14563.60s -> 14567.04s]  I use these gardens for conversations quite extensively,
[14567.04s -> 14569.12s]  but I have to space them out.
[14569.12s -> 14571.40s]  One cannot have things overlapping.
[14571.40s -> 14572.76s]  Now then.
[14572.76s -> 14581.80s]  I believe we are, will be talking about Manpang and your impending death.
[14581.80s -> 14583.48s]  I'm not going to die.
[14583.48s -> 14585.26s]  Oh, you most certainly are.
[14585.90s -> 14587.34s]  Often I shouldn't wonder.
[14587.90s -> 14589.02s]  He points up.
[14589.02s -> 14592.16s]  The dome is gone and it is now nighttime.
[14592.16s -> 14594.43s]  Stars shine overhead.
[14594.43s -> 14598.09s]  I like these gardens for one reason above all.
[14598.09s -> 14599.05s]  Can you see what it is?
[14601.88s -> 14604.92s]  The constellations.
[14604.92s -> 14605.64s]  Exactly.
[14606.70s -> 14608.54s]  Look up there.
[14608.54s -> 14615.68s]  This is one of the only two places in Kaare where the stars of the Zed spell can be seen.
[14615.68s -> 14622.52s]  The other is by the North Gate, but that spot's rather too busy.
[14622.52s -> 14624.12s]  What do you know of that spell?
[14624.12s -> 14627.28s]  The mention of the Zed spell makes you stop short.
[14627.28s -> 14631.44s]  The secret magic, the most powerful knowledge unknown to all.
[14631.44s -> 14633.44s]  What do you know of that spell, you demand?
[14635.34s -> 14640.00s]  Zed is the great discovery of the necromancers.
[14640.00s -> 14643.56s]  A spell powered by and fascinated by death.
[14643.56s -> 14646.51s]  Some thought it prevented death, but it does not.
[14646.83s -> 14648.11s]  Quite the opposite.
[14648.11s -> 14656.76s]  The stars of Zed cause a death of the most significant, final kind.
[14656.76s -> 14658.99s]  What kind of death is that?
[14658.99s -> 14660.48s]  The true death.
[14660.48s -> 14661.52s]  The absence.
[14661.52s -> 14664.75s]  But the secret is too powerful to share openly.
[14664.75s -> 14666.04s]  Please.
[14666.04s -> 14669.88s]  He gestures at another path leading between trees as wide as bears
[14669.88s -> 14673.36s]  that have fallen together to form an arch.
[14673.36s -> 14674.24s]  After you.
[14674.24s -> 14681.23s]  Through the arch.
[14681.23s -> 14685.31s]  You slip under the arch and arrive in a field of bright yellow and purple flowers.
[14685.31s -> 14687.45s]  Terrifically overgrown.
[14687.45s -> 14691.40s]  Brambles choke the edges of the path the man does not follow.
[14691.40s -> 14694.60s]  Call out.
[14694.60s -> 14696.04s]  You call out but hear no response.
[14696.04s -> 14697.64s]  It seems you are quite alone.
[14697.64s -> 14699.61s]  High above you.
[14699.61s -> 14703.37s]  You see two harpies flying past, screaming to each other and pointing.
[14703.37s -> 14705.47s]  But they are not coming for you.
[14705.47s -> 14709.00s]  Search the bushes.
[14709.00s -> 14711.64s]  You search the bushes but find nothing.
[14711.64s -> 14713.40s]  There's nothing hiding there.
[14713.40s -> 14716.24s]  Nothing is waiting for you.
[14716.24s -> 14716.96s]  Move on.
[14716.96s -> 14720.65s]  The beggar has abandoned you.
[14720.65s -> 14730.68s]  It seems you must find the path back to Manpang yourself.
[14730.68s -> 14734.78s]  Onwards.
[14734.78s -> 14738.54s]  You push forwards through the towering flowers into an area of cracked blue paving
[14738.54s -> 14741.66s]  and ronded shrubs in a glass pot.
[14741.66s -> 14744.56s]  To your relief, the beggar is here once more.
[14744.56s -> 14748.81s]  He looks older than ever.
[14748.81s -> 14751.64s]  Now you understand.
[14751.64s -> 14757.45s]  Now you see why you have to die.
[14757.45s -> 14760.56s]  I do not understand you.
[14760.56s -> 14762.40s]  I'll tell you all you need to know.
[14764.00s -> 14767.80s]  This end spell is difficult to cast, you see.
[14767.80s -> 14770.20s]  Because you can't cast it at once.
[14770.20s -> 14773.47s]  You have to cast it at two separate times.
[14774.03s -> 14775.48s]  Two times.
[14775.48s -> 14776.92s]  But one casting.
[14776.92s -> 14778.14s]  Got it?
[14778.14s -> 14780.62s]  Like left and right hands clasped together.
[14780.62s -> 14782.12s]  He demonstrates.
[14782.12s -> 14784.44s]  Linking thumbs and flapping his fingers like a butterfly.
[14788.41s -> 14791.21s]  Uh, go on.
[14791.21s -> 14795.39s]  So you cast it then and before.
[14795.39s -> 14799.71s]  And when both castings are cast, they are the same casting.
[14799.71s -> 14803.29s]  Two castings at different times cannot be at different times.
[14803.29s -> 14805.77s]  So the time between disappears.
[14805.77s -> 14814.49s]  He squashes his butterfly fingers into a single two-handed fist.
[14814.49s -> 14816.43s]  Time collapses?
[14816.43s -> 14817.63s]  Beautifully put.
[14817.63s -> 14822.20s]  The beggar spits a tooth and picks it up to admire.
[14822.20s -> 14824.12s]  Be valuable, Bat.
[14824.12s -> 14825.24s]  One of these days.
[14829.13s -> 14830.86s]  Take the tooth.
[14830.86s -> 14832.22s]  You reach down for it.
[14832.22s -> 14833.98s]  Uncouth villain!
[14835.34s -> 14836.94s]  Now we'd best be getting on.
[14836.94s -> 14840.25s]  We don't want you coming back here when you finally die.
[14843.77s -> 14845.93s]  When I die?
[14845.93s -> 14846.49s]  Yes.
[14846.49s -> 14851.23s]  Throbin closes his dirt-smudged eyes and concentrates.
[14851.23s -> 14854.12s]  And slowly the walls of Manpang return.
[14854.12s -> 14865.77s]  There you are again.
[14867.58s -> 14869.02s]  Hey, not a word.
[14869.02s -> 14870.38s]  There are spies everywhere.
[14870.38s -> 14872.83s]  One last thing to do.
[14872.83s -> 14873.63s]  Draw your sword.
[14876.56s -> 14877.28s]  Why?
[14877.28s -> 14879.29s]  You ask suspiciously.
[14879.29s -> 14881.85s]  It's the sort of thing people do in Manpang.
[14881.85s -> 14882.57s]  Draw it.
[14882.57s -> 14886.81s]  Okay.
[14886.81s -> 14889.42s]  You obediently draw your blade.
[14889.42s -> 14891.34s]  Throbin beams with glee.
[14891.34s -> 14895.74s]  And then before you can stop him, he runs himself deep onto the blade.
[14895.74s -> 14900.03s]  For the ghosts of the backlands, I curse you with this.
[14901.88s -> 14904.67s]  He whispers.
[14904.67s -> 14906.59s]  And there is fury in his eyes.
[14906.59s -> 14912.11s]  In the last moments, you see him hurl his arms up, creating some kind of incantation.
[14912.11s -> 14917.12s]  A terrible force builds around his body, but then seems to only half explode.
[14917.12s -> 14920.76s]  You are caught at the moment of detonation.
[14920.76s -> 14932.28s]  The explosion dies away, its force curiously unspent, as though waiting.
[14932.28s -> 14940.92s]  But you feel stronger for it.
[14940.92s -> 14943.24s]  You look around, still disoriented.
[14943.24s -> 14945.66s]  There's no sign of the beggar.
[14945.66s -> 14948.38s]  The narrow alley mouth opens onto the square.
[14948.38s -> 14949.18s]  Darkness closes in.
[14949.18s -> 14951.34s]  You need to rest, especially on an empty stomach.
[14956.65s -> 14957.37s]  I'm going to sleep here.
[14959.36s -> 14960.88s]  The alley isn't a bad place to rest.
[14960.88s -> 14963.28s]  It's quiet, secluded, and offers plenty of shadow.
[14964.00s -> 14967.60s]  Removing your pack, you try to settle despite the strange noises that drift through the air.
[14967.60s -> 14969.39s]  You've eaten nothing today.
[14969.39s -> 14972.43s]  But you have no provisions and only two vials of blimberry juice.
[14975.21s -> 14976.01s]  I'm not going to drink that.
[14976.65s -> 14979.45s]  Close my eyes.
[14979.45s -> 14981.53s]  You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.
[14982.17s -> 14985.12s]  What is left of the night is restless with visions.
[14985.12s -> 14986.96s]  You're lying on cool, moist ground.
[14987.90s -> 14989.42s]  Underneath a tall, swaying tree.
[14990.43s -> 14992.11s]  There's a nagging pain in your leg.
[14992.67s -> 14995.95s]  And you look down to see a sapling growing up through your thigh.
[14998.28s -> 14999.40s]  Try to move.
[14999.40s -> 15003.63s]  You try to move away, but you are attached to the ground,
[15004.19s -> 15006.67s]  as though the roots of the sapling were your own tendons.
[15007.71s -> 15011.31s]  Through it all, you feel the heat of Anorland burning should your quest fail.
[15011.31s -> 15017.47s]  Sleep will not heal you if you have not eaten.
[15017.47s -> 15020.43s]  You ran out of provisions, entered the Citadel of Manpang,
[15020.43s -> 15022.75s]  and were cursed with the Zeb spell.
[15022.75s -> 15029.26s]  Still unaware.
[15029.26s -> 15031.74s]  You get quickly to your feet.
[15032.30s -> 15034.62s]  You've not been discovered, but you should not wait any longer.
[15034.62s -> 15049.20s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the mystery of Sorcery! Part 4 will continue for the time.
[15049.20s -> 15063.56s]  So we made it all the way through here, up to here.
[15063.56s -> 15064.36s]  There is...
[15065.08s -> 15066.68s]  Yeah, we're getting there.
[15067.24s -> 15072.91s]  There's still probably another four to six hours left, at least.
[15072.91s -> 15075.21s]  It'll probably take another two streams, maybe.
[15082.01s -> 15082.89s]  I know people saying,
[15082.89s -> 15086.81s]  Hey, why did you say this is one of your least favorite games in the series?
[15086.81s -> 15088.97s]  It's not really my least favorite game in the series,
[15088.97s -> 15096.35s]  but it's definitely the hardest.
[15096.35s -> 15098.27s]  I think I like them all for different reasons,
[15098.27s -> 15100.44s]  but I don't really hate...
[15100.44s -> 15101.48s]  I don't hate this one.
[15101.48s -> 15104.76s]  It's just, it's a little different, but it's fun.
[15104.76s -> 15105.64s]  I like it a lot.
[15105.64s -> 15108.75s]  Four to six hours? Really?
[15108.75s -> 15111.47s]  Yeah, you probably should add a one before both of those numbers.
[15111.47s -> 15112.91s]  It's probably gonna take like 10.
[15112.91s -> 15117.18s]  What's your least favorite?
[15119.84s -> 15122.96s]  I mean, technically, it's the same story.
[15122.96s -> 15123.60s]  It's not.
[15123.60s -> 15125.69s]  I mean, if you want to think of it like that.
[15125.69s -> 15129.32s]  But I guess they could...
[15129.32s -> 15131.96s]  They're kind of seasons of a TV show.
[15131.96s -> 15134.33s]  My favorite season is season two, right?
[15134.33s -> 15134.89s]  That's Kari.
[15136.19s -> 15140.49s]  Three and one are in the same space.
[15140.49s -> 15143.44s]  One is more like a giant tutorial.
[15143.44s -> 15145.87s]  And then four is the cleanup.
[15145.87s -> 15150.44s]  And four obviously gets rid of the rewind, which is kind of...
[15150.44s -> 15151.40s]  It's like, ah, shit.
[15151.40s -> 15154.04s]  If I make a mistake, I'm stuck with it.
[15154.04s -> 15157.40s]  But as you see, as we play through this, it becomes a little more...
[15157.40s -> 15161.28s]  It becomes a little different.
[15161.28s -> 15164.16s]  But yeah, that is going to be it for tonight.
[15164.16s -> 15164.72s]  I will see you.
[15164.72s -> 15165.92s]  I want to play Viewfinder.
[15165.92s -> 15167.85s]  So next stream will be Viewfinder.
[15170.73s -> 15173.53s]  I need to make a tweet for the YouToos.
[15173.53s -> 15176.59s]  What should I tweet?
[15176.59s -> 15177.31s]  What do you guys think?
[15177.31s -> 15178.76s]  What's a good tweet?
[15178.76s -> 15183.90s]  What do you think is a good tweet?
[15183.90s -> 15185.85s]  How about like...
[15185.85s -> 15188.89s]  Check it out!
[15188.89s -> 15198.64s]  You're never going to stream again.
[15198.64s -> 15200.65s]  I'll be back in like a few days.
[15200.65s -> 15202.83s]  Let's see.
[15203.87s -> 15208.14s]  Yeah, actually, let's shoot for this weekend.
[15208.14s -> 15209.53s]  That makes sense.
[15209.53s -> 15210.65s]  Like Saturday, Sunday.
[15210.65s -> 15213.05s]  Maybe like Friday, Saturday.
[15213.05s -> 15214.73s]  Just keep an eye on the sus.
[15214.73s -> 15216.89s]  In the next day or two, I'll come in and change it.
[15216.89s -> 15219.08s]  Somewhere in the next three or four days.
[15219.08s -> 15226.44s]  When is Sorcery 4 part two?
[15226.44s -> 15228.04s]  Now that I've actually started it,
[15228.04s -> 15230.92s]  I don't want to have it just sit here and not be done.
[15230.92s -> 15241.28s]  So I would imagine we'll go back to it probably next week.
[15241.28s -> 15244.67s]  Yeah, the YouToos is coming out on August 28th.
[15244.67s -> 15250.06s]  Grotto Beast, if you weren't here, let me show you this.
[15250.06s -> 15251.74s]  Because it is pretty damn cool.
[15251.74s -> 15252.78s]  Take a look at that.
[15252.78s -> 15255.23s]  That is the TTS mod.
[15255.23s -> 15257.13s]  It is almost done.
[15257.13s -> 15259.77s]  It's almost at a point where people can really play it.
[15259.77s -> 15262.51s]  And get in there and mess around in there.
[15262.51s -> 15270.49s]  If you didn't see some of the other pictures,
[15270.49s -> 15272.91s]  let's just go through them pretty quick.
[15272.91s -> 15274.51s]  It looks really, really cool.
[15274.51s -> 15281.28s]  I like the ring.
[15281.28s -> 15282.56s]  Like from the commercial.
[15282.56s -> 15284.28s]  They fight in the ring.
[15284.28s -> 15293.26s]  You actually play in the ring.
[15293.26s -> 15294.30s]  Yeah, it looks great.
[15294.30s -> 15294.94s]  I love it.
[15294.94s -> 15299.16s]  A lot of horses outside your house.
[15299.16s -> 15300.99s]  Yeah.
[15300.99s -> 15302.11s]  What is this exactly?
[15302.75s -> 15305.77s]  This is Grotto Beasts.
[15305.77s -> 15308.65s]  But this is a free standalone.
[15308.65s -> 15309.82s]  Well, that's not true.
[15309.82s -> 15312.30s]  It's a free mod for Tabletop Simulator.
[15312.30s -> 15315.42s]  I've had developers working on this.
[15315.42s -> 15317.66s]  And artists working on this for the last month or two.
[15317.66s -> 15320.54s]  Last two or three months.
[15320.54s -> 15322.67s]  And it's going to be available very soon.
[15322.67s -> 15324.99s]  It has all the Grotto Beast cards in it.
[15324.99s -> 15326.52s]  It is free.
[15326.52s -> 15330.91s]  Just for anybody that has Tabletop to just play it.
[15330.91s -> 15334.24s]  If they want to get in a group and have fun.
[15334.24s -> 15337.47s]  Once it gets a little closer, I'll probably...
[15337.47s -> 15338.59s]  I'll show it a little more.
[15338.59s -> 15345.12s]  You need to do that in a 1700s accent.
[15345.12s -> 15345.60s]  Okay.
[15345.60s -> 15349.52s]  So here we have the Grotto Beast Tournament.
[15349.52s -> 15352.88s]  The Grotto Beast Wrestling Tournament, as you see.
[15352.88s -> 15356.06s]  If you peer your eyes over to the left side of the screen,
[15356.06s -> 15357.58s]  you will see a fire.
[15357.58s -> 15358.46s]  That fire could be...
[15360.09s -> 15361.29s]  What could be in that fire?
[15361.29s -> 15364.12s]  Notice behind that, you see the cauldron.
[15364.12s -> 15367.72s]  And you see next to that, you see the frog launcher.
[15367.72s -> 15374.30s]  That's 1900s.
[15374.30s -> 15380.96s]  That's close enough.
[15380.96s -> 15386.35s]  That was a snake oil salesman from like 1880.
[15386.35s -> 15392.51s]  Or like 1890 or something.
[15392.51s -> 15392.83s]  All right.
[15394.14s -> 15395.50s]  I'm going to make a tweet for you two's.
[15397.15s -> 15399.23s]  It'll be up probably tonight or maybe tomorrow morning.
[15399.23s -> 15400.27s]  I might see if...
[15400.27s -> 15401.69s]  I might just put it up tomorrow morning.
[15403.13s -> 15404.73s]  Where more people will see it.
[15404.73s -> 15410.54s]  But yeah.
[15410.54s -> 15411.34s]  Take care.
[15411.34s -> 15412.08s]  See you soon.
[15412.08s -> 15412.72s]  Thanks for watching.
[15412.72s -> 15413.60s]  See you guys later this week.
[15413.60s -> 15414.40s]  Keep an eye on the sus.
[15415.48s -> 15417.72s]  I am going to briefly talk about this.
[15417.72s -> 15420.80s]  Because I don't want to confuse people.
[15423.42s -> 15425.74s]  In pre-stream, we talked about slowing down this year.
[15426.81s -> 15428.17s]  I know back in January...
[15428.17s -> 15430.92s]  Obviously back in June, I talked about this a little bit too.
[15430.92s -> 15440.94s]  But I'm getting close to starting a different kind of period of my online content life.
[15440.94s -> 15443.66s]  And I want to just briefly talk about it.
[15443.66s -> 15444.54s]  Because I don't...
[15444.54s -> 15447.26s]  This is not like, hey everybody, it's time to retire.
[15448.49s -> 15451.02s]  But soon.
[15451.02s -> 15454.30s]  I'm going to give you kind of what the plan is going to be.
[15454.30s -> 15457.20s]  Plan is obviously like once I started working at Offbrand.
[15458.20s -> 15458.92s]  That's going great.
[15458.92s -> 15459.96s]  I love that.
[15459.96s -> 15461.08s]  On a bunch of projects.
[15461.32s -> 15465.50s]  I've been clicking with the colleagues and all the other work.
[15465.50s -> 15466.96s]  It's been great.
[15466.96s -> 15471.16s]  But I really want to focus a lot on YouTube.
[15471.16s -> 15474.84s]  I want to get back to making original YouTube content.
[15474.84s -> 15480.28s]  I've talked a bunch of times about, hey, I have a video I'm working on.
[15480.28s -> 15480.76s]  I want to...
[15480.76s -> 15483.48s]  Hey, this video that I think is going to be really funny.
[15483.48s -> 15488.70s]  I really want to spend time on that kind of stuff.
[15488.70s -> 15490.78s]  But just the frequency is going to slow.
[15491.90s -> 15493.44s]  I mean, I'm getting older.
[15493.44s -> 15495.68s]  I need to start to get my health back in order.
[15497.60s -> 15500.57s]  I think it's just the right thing to do.
[15500.57s -> 15504.89s]  And I'm imagining over the next few months, you'll probably see a little bit less streaming
[15504.89s -> 15506.89s]  content and a little more YouTube stuff.
[15509.26s -> 15513.48s]  I'm calling it kind of a soft retirement.
[15513.48s -> 15515.72s]  Because it's not really...
[15515.72s -> 15517.08s]  I mean, it is, but it isn't.
[15518.28s -> 15520.36s]  I really want to do some more YouTube stuff.
[15520.36s -> 15522.76s]  Get a little bit further away from streaming.
[15522.76s -> 15534.33s]  And I have said many times that I want to make sure that you guys know when this is
[15534.33s -> 15538.49s]  happening so you understand the time frame.
[15538.49s -> 15542.25s]  Back in January of this year, I mentioned it a few times.
[15542.25s -> 15546.49s]  And I don't want to tell anybody, like, oh, hey, in January, I'm retiring.
[15546.49s -> 15548.03s]  Like, that's just...
[15548.03s -> 15548.51s]  I don't even...
[15548.51s -> 15549.63s]  You can't even call it that.
[15549.63s -> 15554.83s]  But I'm sticking around.
[15554.83s -> 15556.59s]  It's just going to change a little bit.
[15556.59s -> 15562.28s]  I'm going to condense a lot of my, I think, my social presence, like social media presence.
[15562.28s -> 15563.48s]  There's obviously...
[15563.48s -> 15565.40s]  Like, I barely even use my Twitter.
[15565.40s -> 15569.76s]  I don't even know what to even do with it anymore.
[15569.76s -> 15571.92s]  But I'm happy.
[15571.92s -> 15573.04s]  I'm really happy.
[15573.04s -> 15575.05s]  And honestly, I think that's the point.
[15575.05s -> 15577.74s]  The point is to drop the...
[15577.74s -> 15582.04s]  Maybe a little bit of my own internal pressure I've been putting on myself for the last three
[15582.04s -> 15591.36s]  or four years and just kind of go back to the way it was a long time ago.
[15591.36s -> 15594.36s]  I used to just make a YouTube video and I just felt like doing it.
[15594.36s -> 15595.93s]  And that's kind of the way it is.
[15595.93s -> 15601.74s]  And taking maybe some of the monetary aspect away from it, where I'm not...
[15601.74s -> 15602.30s]  I wouldn't...
[15602.30s -> 15603.82s]  I'm not streaming for money.
[15604.81s -> 15606.24s]  Money.
[15606.24s -> 15609.24s]  It's more so, I want to do something today.
[15609.24s -> 15610.60s]  And whatever that is, is what I'm going to do.
[15616.41s -> 15617.21s]  Money.
[15617.21s -> 15622.81s]  Somebody said that's how it should be.
[15622.81s -> 15624.49s]  It's been amazing.
[15625.13s -> 15627.29s]  I've had an incredible last 10 years.
[15627.29s -> 15629.96s]  12 years.
[15629.96s -> 15630.68s]  And it's not over.
[15631.24s -> 15634.28s]  I just want to make sure that I telegraph this.
[15635.82s -> 15636.86s]  Like back in June.
[15636.86s -> 15639.20s]  Like back in January of this year.
[15639.20s -> 15644.57s]  Just setting those expectations of, I'm going to turn it on when I feel like it.
[15644.57s -> 15646.41s]  When it's something I think it's fun to do.
[15646.97s -> 15648.89s]  Working on a bunch of projects at Offbrand.
[15648.89s -> 15652.88s]  Which is, again, I'm going to reiterate again, has been going very, very, very well.
[15654.73s -> 15655.21s]  Yeah.
[15655.21s -> 15658.40s]  Ro's telegraphing it like a market attack.
[15660.16s -> 15667.34s]  Oh no, he's turning into stone.
[15667.90s -> 15676.06s]  No, 2024 is kind of when this is all going to go into place, really.
[15676.06s -> 15680.22s]  So don't expect very many major changes this year.
[15680.22s -> 15683.48s]  But it's gonna start to be a thing.
[15683.48s -> 15688.28s]  The sus is going to just kind of be like, hey, maybe at the end of the week.
[15688.28s -> 15691.00s]  Maybe a few days from now.
[15691.00s -> 15699.24s]  And it's kind of interesting because, I'll give you a little bit of real talk here.
[15699.32s -> 15703.16s]  Back before Dollhouse.
[15703.16s -> 15707.40s]  I was thinking about this before Dollhouse.
[15707.40s -> 15708.92s]  And then I did Dollhouse.
[15708.92s -> 15711.90s]  And I was like, holy shit, I want to do it.
[15711.90s -> 15713.66s]  I want to do like way more of that.
[15713.66s -> 15715.76s]  I want to do that.
[15715.76s -> 15716.16s]  Can I do?
[15716.16s -> 15718.32s]  How many more of those can I physically do?
[15718.32s -> 15719.84s]  How do I do that again?
[15721.47s -> 15723.63s]  And that reignited a lot of the spark, obviously.
[15724.91s -> 15729.55s]  And again, let me, it's, this is not me telling you that I don't like streaming anymore.
[15729.55s -> 15737.90s]  I'm just starting to see a different sort of pivot path of focus a little bit more on YouTube.
[15737.90s -> 15740.04s]  Pull back a little bit on live.
[15740.04s -> 15741.72s]  And be working at off-brand.
[15741.72s -> 15746.65s]  Did you say, did you already say this?
[15746.65s -> 15748.25s]  Yeah, I've said it a few times.
[15748.25s -> 15757.02s]  I have said this a few times.
[15757.02s -> 15761.90s]  But something that's important to remember about me kind of repeating myself on this.
[15761.90s -> 15765.63s]  I want to make sure the most amount of people hear this.
[15765.63s -> 15771.39s]  And something about doing videos and streaming is, I'm talking to you guys right now.
[15771.39s -> 15774.91s]  But a week from now, there's 9,000 people here.
[15774.91s -> 15778.46s]  There might be 8,000 different people.
[15778.46s -> 15781.98s]  So it's kind of, I want to just kind of make sure that people are aware.
[15781.98s -> 15787.96s]  That is something that's going to be happening over the next three to six months.
[15787.96s -> 15789.69s]  He hates us.
[15789.69s -> 15797.39s]  No, that is not the case.
[15797.39s -> 15800.99s]  And seeing like the YouTube stuff is, I don't know.
[15800.99s -> 15805.28s]  You kind of look at it and you go, oh shit, okay.
[15805.28s -> 15810.57s]  This is a, that's like, that's dollhouse.
[15810.57s -> 15811.37s]  Okay, that's cool.
[15814.92s -> 15815.56s]  We get it, we get it.
[15815.56s -> 15816.92s]  Somebody said, I get it, I get it.
[15816.92s -> 15818.04s]  You need to live your life.
[15818.04s -> 15823.71s]  Well, I'm not going to stop streaming.
[15823.71s -> 15825.79s]  I hope that's what you're getting from this.
[15825.79s -> 15828.32s]  I'm not stopping.
[15828.32s -> 15835.23s]  It's just changing and slowing down.
[15835.23s -> 15838.20s]  What could reignite you again?
[15838.20s -> 15839.16s]  Already happened.
[15839.16s -> 15841.36s]  It's already happening.
[15841.36s -> 15844.40s]  Working on shows, working with other content creators.
[15844.40s -> 15847.28s]  I mean, look at the Rambush.
[15847.28s -> 15849.08s]  That was a Rambush show.
[15849.08s -> 15852.43s]  That was, it's like, that was fucking fun.
[15852.43s -> 15854.19s]  And got to be a part of that.
[15854.19s -> 15856.43s]  And I got to help create concepts for it.
[15856.43s -> 15858.27s]  And I was like, I acted in it.
[15858.27s -> 15862.32s]  And it was a lot of fun.
[15862.32s -> 15863.60s]  Don't set him on fire.
[15866.09s -> 15869.85s]  Three or four years ago, I think even before, maybe right after dollhouse, I think I said
[15869.85s -> 15872.09s]  that, man, doing that is fun.
[15872.09s -> 15874.09s]  And I would love to be on part of like a creative team.
[15874.73s -> 15887.18s]  It's hard when you say not stopping and then you use the word retiring.
[15887.18s -> 15890.28s]  Well, soft retiring.
[15890.28s -> 15893.44s]  It's because I'm not just going to leave.
[15893.44s -> 15894.88s]  It's like, OK, guys, that's enough.
[15894.88s -> 15895.76s]  I'm done streaming.
[15895.76s -> 15896.64s]  See you later.
[15896.64s -> 15898.24s]  And then I never turn the stream on ever again.
[15898.24s -> 15899.20s]  That's not going to happen.
[15899.20s -> 15901.23s]  Just far less.
[15904.65s -> 15910.22s]  Semi-retired.
[15910.22s -> 15912.76s]  What about one last job?
[15912.76s -> 15915.32s]  One last job, Arthur.
[15915.32s -> 15918.28s]  How about like 50 last jobs, Arthur?
[15922.80s -> 15929.21s]  Why are you tentative about this?
[15930.88s -> 15934.59s]  Because I've been around for a really long time.
[15934.59s -> 15935.79s]  And I want to make sure I get it right.
[15935.79s -> 15937.95s]  And I want to make sure it's truly what I really want to do.
[15937.95s -> 15941.53s]  It's been a very long time.
[15941.53s -> 15949.74s]  I have heard from some of you guys before that you're you graduated college and you
[15949.74s -> 15952.86s]  started watching me when you were like 13.
[15955.88s -> 15956.36s]  What?
[15956.36s -> 15957.56s]  Like, no way.
[15957.56s -> 15959.44s]  It's been a long time.
[15959.44s -> 15961.28s]  I just want to make sure I'm doing this right.
[15961.28s -> 15963.55s]  So we're going to do it slow.
[15963.55s -> 15965.95s]  I'm going to make sure I'm doing it the way that I really want to.
[15965.95s -> 15969.88s]  And I'll see you later this week.
[15969.88s -> 15972.22s]  That's not changing.
[15972.22s -> 15972.94s]  Don't worry.
[15972.94s -> 15979.68s]  What did I say in pre-stream earlier?
[15980.08s -> 15982.48s]  I said, what did I not do yet?
[15982.48s -> 15983.28s]  Oh, that's right.
[15983.28s -> 15986.43s]  The Elden Ring DLC has not come out yet.
[15986.43s -> 15988.59s]  I can't leave.
[15988.59s -> 15989.39s]  I cannot leave.
[15989.95s -> 16013.04s]  Elden Ring DLC is not out.
[16013.04s -> 16015.60s]  It said, auction off your channel when you retire.
[16016.73s -> 16017.93s]  No, I'm not.
[16017.93s -> 16019.61s]  That's not going to happen.
[16019.61s -> 16031.18s]  But I don't want to talk in circles about it.
[16032.25s -> 16036.49s]  But just know that it's something that's floating around in my brain.
[16036.49s -> 16038.25s]  And YouTube stuff.
[16038.25s -> 16039.61s]  I want to make some YouTube videos.
[16039.61s -> 16040.41s]  I want to.
[16040.41s -> 16042.81s]  Look, I might even go live on YouTube.
[16043.37s -> 16045.77s]  I might turn the stream on on YouTube.
[16048.04s -> 16048.76s]  I don't know.
[16048.76s -> 16050.28s]  That's really possible.
[16050.28s -> 16050.76s]  We'll see.
[16052.60s -> 16053.40s]  I don't know.
[16053.40s -> 16055.07s]  Maybe I'll just do it one day.
[16055.07s -> 16061.45s]  I talked in pre-stream about how, like, just doing stuff for no reason that I thought would be funny for a minute.
[16061.45s -> 16063.77s]  In that soft retirement, I was going to do it.
[16063.77s -> 16072.20s]  YouTube live.
[16072.20s -> 16072.70s]  Bald.
[16073.61s -> 16074.73s]  Oh, no, you said bad.
[16074.73s -> 16075.37s]  Okay.
[16075.37s -> 16084.92s]  I thought you were calling me bald.
[16084.92s -> 16085.24s]  All right.
[16085.24s -> 16086.28s]  I'll see you guys later.
[16086.28s -> 16088.97s]  I know.
[16088.97s -> 16089.69s]  I don't.
[16089.69s -> 16095.61s]  Every three or four months, I've been like, hey, you know, slow down and, you know, chilling out with streams.
[16095.61s -> 16097.13s]  And now this face cam.
[16098.01s -> 16100.86s]  I just want to make sure people know because people pay money to this channel.
[16102.00s -> 16103.60s]  People pay money to this channel.
[16103.60s -> 16104.80s]  I want you to be very aware.
[16106.36s -> 16107.56s]  And stuff like subs.
[16109.00s -> 16113.40s]  I'm not going to encourage that going forward here in the next few months.
[16113.40s -> 16113.56s]  Right?
[16113.56s -> 16116.92s]  Like, I'm not going to be like, oh, hey, um, for the subs.
[16116.92s -> 16123.42s]  Like, no, I, I, I used to treat it the same way as, you know, I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing.
[16131.60s -> 16131.84s]  Yeah.
[16131.84s -> 16136.72s]  Even in what I, in what I'm describing, even if I didn't have partner, I would still just
[16136.72s -> 16138.00s]  stream when I felt like it.
[16138.00s -> 16138.64s]  So don't worry.
[16140.48s -> 16142.36s]  It's not about the money.
[16143.08s -> 16143.96s]  It's about streaming.
[16144.68s -> 16145.16s]  For fun.
[16145.96s -> 16148.22s]  Batman.
[16148.86s -> 16156.57s]  All right.
[16156.57s -> 16158.49s]  I don't, I don't, I don't want to keep talking about it.
[16158.49s -> 16160.57s]  I don't want to keep making people be like, wait, what the fuck is happening?
[16160.57s -> 16161.61s]  Is he, what's he's coming?
[16161.61s -> 16162.25s]  He's gone tomorrow.
[16162.25s -> 16163.45s]  He's literally retiring tomorrow.
[16167.37s -> 16171.37s]  I will see you guys on Friday or Saturday of this week.
[16171.37s -> 16180.04s]  See you soon.
[16180.76s -> 16182.44s]  See you on Friday or Saturday.
[16183.08s -> 16184.36s]  Goodbye.
[16184.36s -> 16185.16s]  Take care of yourselves.
[16185.72s -> 16186.68s]  Call your mother.
[16186.68s -> 16187.32s]  Call your father.
[16188.04s -> 16189.37s]  You know what?
[16189.37s -> 16194.64s]  Just like have a nice, like have a nice hour where you're just like lounging around at
[16194.64s -> 16196.88s]  some point today, tomorrow, next day.
[16196.88s -> 16199.56s]  Take care.
[16200.51s -> 16201.87s]  See you soon.
