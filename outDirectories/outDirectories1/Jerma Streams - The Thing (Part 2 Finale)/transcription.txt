[1.78s -> 30.36s]  Okay, let's finish the thing. Make sure I can hear what's going on. Kind of can. Can you guys hear
[30.36s -> 48.01s]  this? You can, but you can't see it. Why? Oh, shit, there we go. Let me just redo this. Finishing the
[48.01s -> 56.22s]  thing. The game name is The Thing, obviously. All right, where was I going? Anybody remember what
[56.22s -> 75.27s]  the hell was going on in this game? Well, that's not correct. It'll be correct in a moment. Back
[75.27s -> 104.15s]  down to zero. Put this back down to zero. Should be good now. Okay. Hey, there you are. Now I should
[104.15s -> 122.62s]  do this and then this. We're ready to go. All right, so the last thing we did, 459.12. This looks like
[122.62s -> 137.94s]  it, right? Is that correct? Is this correct? Right, because I have to, okay, so I go down
[139.21s -> 142.81s]  through, you just had, I had to run. Oh yeah, I remember I said this was going to be horrible.
[143.53s -> 151.18s]  Okay, well, all right, let me like remember how to play. All right, I was going to run. That was the
[151.18s -> 165.24s]  idea. What's going on? Because we're being, we're under attack right now. There's huge monsters in
[165.24s -> 173.30s]  the way and I was going to run by and go down because the elevator is there, right? Okay,
[173.30s -> 179.94s]  I remember. I think DPI got like reset somehow. All right, it's right here. Monster comes through
[179.94s -> 191.35s]  the door. Run, run around the circle. All right, all right. Money stream part two. No, no money
[191.35s -> 204.49s]  stream part two. Get me out. And then it's this way. Who did that? That was Gibbler. Gibbler just
[204.49s -> 217.75s]  gave 10,000 bits. They said money stream part two. No, and then they said LUL. Thank you for the 10,000
[217.75s -> 223.27s]  bits. Thank you for the extreme amount of money. Thank you. Cream, corn, wine. Should I just play
[223.27s -> 228.95s]  the thing every day? Should I just play the thing every single day? I think I figured out the meta.
[228.95s -> 237.61s]  It's just put on the thing for like an hour stream. Cream, corn, five community subs, potato
[237.61s -> 246.58s]  chief, 10 community subs. What the fuck? Here we go. Thank you guys, seriously. But now I,
[247.14s -> 250.74s]  okay, there's a monster that's over here. I'm going to burn him. Thank you, both of you.
[251.54s -> 261.13s]  Okay, don't want to fuck this up. Hey, you boy, 10 community subs. Gnarly, five community subs. What
[261.13s -> 266.41s]  the fuck? It's the, the thing just does it to everybody. Why is the thing doing this to you guys?
[267.45s -> 281.32s]  All right, I can't die here. This is like actually annoying and hard. Wizard, Ribbit, thank you for
[281.32s -> 286.36s]  the five community subs. Hey, thank you. Flissenberg, five community subs. Thanks, both of you.
[289.34s -> 298.89s]  Die. I could probably just run by you too. No, I can't because they spawn. All right, will you die?
[299.85s -> 314.39s]  Die. Burn. RoboLamp just gave five community subs. Come here. All right, for the love of God.
[316.33s -> 328.07s]  KpShit, thanks for the five subs. I said that name so incorrect. K, what'd I say? KpShit?
[329.48s -> 333.16s]  ClassicBanana, thanks for the five subs. Shardopus, thanks for the five subs.
[334.12s -> 344.04s]  Oh my God. But thankfully now I have healing. How much health do I have? Five health packs.
[344.04s -> 351.94s]  Don't fuck it up. Thank you guys, seriously. The thing money streams.
[354.86s -> 359.42s]  Niershue, another five community subs. RarePepeBodyLotion, thanks for the five community subs.
[367.42s -> 385.26s]  PixelMike, thanks for the five subs. Fuck. Did Niershue give another five subs right now?
[387.29s -> 397.94s]  Another money stream. EvilCrucifix5, I'm telling you, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna test this theory.
[399.86s -> 406.30s]  In like, in like six months, I'm going to play the thing again. It's time for slime five community
[406.30s -> 420.87s]  subs. Thank you, slime. Die. Come on. I need to get back to where I was. Pog. Not even a thank you
[420.87s -> 426.70s]  anymore. Just the number. No, that's not true. That's not true. I got cool on at least three
[426.70s -> 440.10s]  of those levels. No, thank you, seriously. All of you. FraudyWeapon5, you boy. Ten, thank you.
[440.74s -> 450.71s]  I thought you were dead. Holy shit, it's happening again. It's actually happening again.
[453.77s -> 457.22s]  All right, here we go. This, that guy's a bad guy though. That guy's a bad guy.
[459.46s -> 469.40s]  I don't care about that guy. I just want, I need you to stay here. We're just gonna make it to the
[469.40s -> 476.50s]  bottom. VGB200, thanks for the five community subs. Thank you. I just gotta get to the,
[476.50s -> 481.86s]  fuck that guy. Remember that guy's a bad guy. Remember that, that's important. All right,
[481.86s -> 485.46s]  this is where I left off before. This is the tricky, stupid, dumb part that I hated.
[485.94s -> 490.74s]  I may have been a little tired. That's why I hated it. I remember now. Now I remember I hate this
[491.46s -> 496.26s]  because if you get sprayed with water, it takes off more health than getting shot by a gun.
[496.26s -> 504.44s]  Okay, that's why, that's why I remember. I remember this. He hates this. I do. Give me out my gun.
[511.69s -> 519.24s]  Watch the steam. Watch the steam. Okay, give me a different, I need something different
[519.24s -> 525.96s]  in my offhand. I need a fire extinguisher. Yeah, because I need to use it in a minute.
[526.90s -> 530.74s]  Thanks for the gift sub. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, whoever's given them, all of you.
[532.26s -> 537.75s]  Right, this part. Okay, now you do, you gotta do the, this part. It's a rocket launcher.
[538.84s -> 545.78s]  Jill Krungus, thanks with five subs. I think I can just shoot that shit. I can. All right, here we go.
[546.42s -> 554.55s]  I need a, do I need a flashlight for this part? Yep, put on the flashlight, Jeremy. Don't be an idiot.
[554.55s -> 561.03s]  This is the part where, yeah, I get swarmed by the little things.
[561.83s -> 571.94s]  Where is it? There's one more. There's one more. I don't want to back up into the steam. Where's the
[571.94s -> 580.50s]  last one? ChunkyBeloni10 community subs. Thank you, ChunkyBeloni. Thank you guys for the other, like,
[581.46s -> 590.55s]  guy sits down and receives huge sums of money. Thank you. Thank you for the money.
[591.27s -> 599.62s]  Thank you. Who was that? Who was that? Thank you for that money. Hey, number. Thank you for the money.
[599.70s -> 607.94s]  Five subs. Just forgot to give me, thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you. Appreciate that.
[607.94s -> 614.58s]  Thanks for the, thanks for the 10 community subs and thank you for the $50. Also, thank you to
[618.33s -> 628.49s]  BigJunkus for that money you gave me. Who gave the money? Somebody gave $50. Who was it?
[629.88s -> 636.33s]  I don't, I need to know. I need to know. What am I? What am I without my fucking shout out money?
[636.81s -> 657.35s]  What am I? No, no, no, it stopped. It stopped. What do I do? Oh, hey guys,
[659.08s -> 668.44s]  playing the thing here. Oh, gnarly. Thanks for the nine community subs. Thank you. Appreciate that.
[668.44s -> 677.42s]  Thanks for the money. Nine more subs just came in. Tier one. Unbelievable. Gnarly62, you are a
[677.42s -> 689.27s]  fucking legend. Let me just tell you. Nice work. Here we go. Wait, it's behind me, right?
[697.69s -> 721.72s]  What is this hip tracking? I only have two, I can't say the word. Magazine. That's right.
[721.72s -> 733.54s]  Magazine, magazine, magazine, magazine. That's got it right. That's got it right. Yep. Okay. Fire
[733.54s -> 744.86s]  extinguisher. I was already at like one health pack by this point. So that zombie guy is not
[744.86s -> 762.26s]  going to come down here, is he? I don't think so. Not that I remember. What the hell is this guy
[762.26s -> 774.38s]  doing? Not the behind me, right? I only have, okay, this is bad. I, is there any, okay, give me my
[774.38s -> 786.92s]  rocket launcher. I don't understand what happened there. That didn't hit it. It hit the corner of
[786.92s -> 790.44s]  the, what did it do? What happened there? What happened there? What happened? I don't understand.
[819.16s -> 831.53s]  I'm so mad right now. This is sad. Yeah, I know. That was bullshit. That thing has a hitbox
[831.53s -> 841.11s]  as big as the screen you're seeing right now. I'm almost there though. I have to wait because
[841.11s -> 849.43s]  this, this is what screwed me up last time. Shoot this. Wait. Okay. There are aliens that come out
[849.43s -> 867.91s]  from this guy's body, right? Did I kill it? Did I? No, I didn't. I remember this part. It has to die
[867.91s -> 875.00s]  on screen. Yes, I know. I get it. Just like every Game of Thrones character. If they don't die on
[875.00s -> 894.26s]  screen, then they didn't fucking die. That was good, right? How am I going to do this? Remember
[894.26s -> 912.07s]  this happened last time? What do I, I can't, I don't know why it's not dead. This is, this is,
[912.07s -> 915.35s]  this is the worst thing. This is one of the top five worst things that have been done in the video
[915.35s -> 936.63s]  game. I can't, I, what am I supposed to do? I soft-locked myself because I shot the barrels
[936.63s -> 941.43s]  before, but if I came over here to get it in my view, I would have gotten blown up by this barrel
[941.43s -> 964.20s]  because I would have to stand right here and they did. What the fuck? What the fuck?
[987.18s -> 996.14s]  Shoot the, why does it not fire? Dude, this gun is, doesn't make any fucking sense.
[999.80s -> 1015.30s]  You gotta be kidding me. I can't even go around him. This is the stupid, this is the stupidest
[1015.30s -> 1024.01s]  thing I've ever done. By the way, the shotgun shoots 8% of the time that you click the button.
[1027.24s -> 1044.71s]  Like when I click to shoot the shotgun, it happens every 10th click. I am fucking around with this,
[1044.71s -> 1057.00s]  this dumb ass shit. I'll tell you. Not, not on a hard. All right. I want to do a test here. Ready?
[1057.00s -> 1068.25s]  Shotgun. It works now. So when I'm clicking, doing this, you know, an actual fight,
[1069.13s -> 1082.41s]  why does it not fire? Does it make any sense? So go back and watch the, like every time I've
[1082.41s -> 1090.98s]  used the shotgun in a fight and you hear, and it doesn't do anything, you'll, you will physically
[1090.98s -> 1121.85s]  hear the clicking like this. It just happened. Now, now it just shot like four times instantly.
[1121.85s -> 1130.49s]  That's why I can't, you can't use a shotgun. The shotgun sucks. All right. What, what big bits?
[1130.49s -> 1143.10s]  Did I miss bits? Wipe your tears with money. I don't, I don't even, I don't see them on here.
[1143.10s -> 1148.01s]  It was 20,000. It was like 200 fucking dollars came in. Are you kidding me?
[1150.26s -> 1163.77s]  No, I'm getting baited. Why do I have to go all the way from, why can't you have a save point
[1163.77s -> 1182.79s]  anywhere in between here and there? You throw so much junk at that stairwell. Dude, I almost
[1182.79s -> 1187.34s]  want to go get like a hack to fucking save state the game. This is one of those fucking
[1188.22s -> 1199.22s]  stupid ass games that has like segments like this. Report and report. Don't report me.
[1199.86s -> 1215.32s]  It's a fake gamer. Get out of the fucking way. Oh, this guy's a stupid ass gamer. I went the wrong
[1215.32s -> 1236.86s]  way. So I'm not even gonna, how do I do this without wasting ammo and shit here? I thought
[1236.86s -> 1247.67s]  that was a rumor because there's this guy in here. So I'm going to, I guess I could just make the,
[1247.67s -> 1255.03s]  no, cause then you get spawned. I have to just kill this guy now. I actually missed 150 dollars.
[1255.67s -> 1271.69s]  Did I seriously? Come on up. All right, run. I'm so glad there's no stamina in this game.
[1283.77s -> 1292.58s]  Watch it. Stop, stop, stop, stop. He still doesn't know to shoot them and then burn them.
[1293.94s -> 1305.69s]  I thought that was only for like the humanoid ones. Is that all of them? It's hard to tell
[1305.69s -> 1313.72s]  because there's like, there's no feedback when you shoot anything. Bullets just kind of disappear
[1313.72s -> 1318.28s]  into enemies. It's not, there's barely any feedback. You only get feedback from this.
[1319.08s -> 1351.70s]  Is he still alive? What are you doing? Dead? Dead. Okay. All right, let's try this again.
[1353.21s -> 1357.21s]  This time when I get down to that part with the barrels, I'm not just going to shoot the barrels.
[1357.21s -> 1367.11s]  I'm going to wait till I can see it, but it's going to kill me. I don't know. Not jubated.
[1368.55s -> 1395.50s]  All right, here we go. What? Who said that? What?
[1395.50s -> 1410.28s]  What? Can I go? Oh yeah, this part.
[1421.16s -> 1439.48s]  Shit. All right, give me, is it more? There's more. How? Okay. Give me a weapon.
[1439.48s -> 1444.70s]  I'll give you a weapon. We'll see if we can use you. Stop, stop moving. Get over here. Get over
[1444.70s -> 1450.94s]  here. Stop running up there. Don't be so stupid. Why are you going over there? Follow me over here.
[1450.94s -> 1474.18s]  Oh, I hate you. He just stands up there. Oh, it's getting hard. It's getting hard for me to not
[1477.34s -> 1502.71s]  just pretend I beat the game. What? These guys just spawned and he is infected.
[1503.51s -> 1511.14s]  He's, he's infected immediately and I can't run away because I'm going to get sprayed.
[1516.17s -> 1521.88s]  No, I remember shooting him in the head with a rifle. Oh great. This is where it gets all
[1521.88s -> 1537.82s]  fucked up now. I actually remember shooting this guy in the head with a rifle. I mean,
[1537.82s -> 1541.26s]  it was like four or five days ago, but I remember, I remember shooting him in the head with a rifle
[1541.26s -> 1579.27s]  when he was up there and he turned. This is so bad. Oh, it's tough for me to, cause they spawn
[1579.27s -> 1584.39s]  here and you can't, I can't go this way because of this and I can't go this way because of this.
[1584.39s -> 1589.99s]  So the fucking claw monsters just keep spawning here and jumping on your face. And if you burn
[1589.99s -> 1603.14s]  them, you burn yourself. Shittiest fucking long spiral hallway. Oh wait, what's that? What happened?
[1603.14s -> 1641.02s]  I walked five feet. Did we spawn underneath my body? Can I walk now? Please. Where is it?
[1641.02s -> 1659.54s]  How the fuck am I going to kill the gigantic thing that takes up the whole hall? That shit
[1659.54s -> 1667.85s]  ain't going to happen. How am I going to do that? The guy that takes up the whole thing.
[1669.03s -> 1672.63s]  I got to run backwards and burn them, but I'm going to get burnt by the fucking steam.
[1673.11s -> 1695.75s]  Okay. I'm not going to blow this up. Can I spawn that guy without,
[1695.75s -> 1713.18s]  I don't know, I'm going to go very, very slowly. All right. This one, I remember this one. This
[1713.18s -> 1724.54s]  one was stupid too. So I have to do this up all the way up there without having it somehow hit
[1724.54s -> 1732.60s]  this one or this one. I don't, I don't, did you see what that grenade did? That grenade went
[1732.60s -> 1781.24s]  like a pit man's suitcase over here. That doesn't make any sense.
[1807.99s -> 1816.78s]  He looks like the greedy runner. I just, I don't. Okay. So now what are you supposed to do here?
[1817.50s -> 1832.38s]  I don't even have any health packs left. I'm so fucked. Just the casino. I'm so fucked right
[1832.38s -> 1840.12s]  now. Like, I don't know what they even expect you to do here because if I stand over there,
[1840.12s -> 1846.28s]  it doesn't destroy it. If I stand over here, I die from this, but I have to, I don't get it.
[1847.64s -> 1852.28s]  Use a grenade and run. It's going to shoot at me and blow up the, it's going to blow this up.
[1852.28s -> 1870.47s]  Sniper rifle doesn't work, but the sniper rifle doesn't do anything. Now I'm in trouble. What?
[1883.21s -> 1887.69s]  If I shoot the barrels here, I can't see that it's, this is just a rock and a hard place,
[1887.69s -> 1907.42s]  but I can't shoot them from over here because it doesn't blow up the gun. Don't reload the save.
[1907.42s -> 1915.29s]  Why not? That's not a new level. Is it an, is that, wait, is it a new, new game?
[1916.68s -> 1922.28s]  Save the medic. No, you can't save the medic. He's fake from the beginning. I'm going to prove it
[1922.28s -> 1932.78s]  right now. I'm going to shoot him in the head. The second I see him, the medic is pretending.
[1932.78s -> 1940.28s]  Yeah. Let me just see what happens if I do this too. If I die in there, can I just restart the
[1940.36s -> 1959.58s]  level? Uh, Bob boy, this one, hey, Bob boy, this one's for you. Thanks for the five community subs,
[1959.58s -> 1973.30s]  Bob boy. All right. So if I die in here, like if I just die right now, like let the, well,
[1973.30s -> 1993.82s]  I restart level and start here. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to stun this guy just because I'm going
[1993.82s -> 2041.78s]  to. Okay. Oh, that would, why did you take so long to do that? Okay. For the love of God, please.
[2042.74s -> 2059.50s]  Jax is online. He hates gifts. No, I don't hate gifts. I love gifts. Thank you for everybody for
[2059.50s -> 2075.21s]  the gifts. The current any percent speed run of this game is 40 minutes. That's, that's pretty
[2075.21s -> 2089.18s]  ridiculous. Okay. I got to just get in there now. I wonder how fucked up it is. Yeah. I wonder how
[2089.18s -> 2108.46s]  many like actual like skips there are. Shoot. Let's go. I'm going to make sure you don't get
[2108.46s -> 2138.44s]  touched. Stay, stay, stay. Come here. You and me. Let's go. Did he get touched? He didn't. By the
[2138.44s -> 2141.48s]  way, that's just a dice roll. If he's going to get hit or not, because he can't kill three things
[2141.48s -> 2147.42s]  like that in five seconds. Follow me. Let's go. Yes, sir. Are you, are you going to do this thing?
[2147.98s -> 2162.87s]  You can do the stupid thing. They're getting hit by the steam. Okay. Let's go. Follow me.
[2164.04s -> 2169.64s]  You turn right now. I'm going to be so pissed off. Wait, watch out.
[2169.96s -> 2176.20s]  Hold still and I'll fix you up. Oh my God. You're a medic. Please don't just turn and make this a
[2176.20s -> 2195.88s]  complete disaster. Please. He's going to fucking turn right when it matters. Save game. There is
[2195.88s -> 2227.38s]  no quick save. I needed to test. Somebody said to test that to see if you can just give the body.
[2227.38s -> 2238.34s]  You got fucking kidding me. That was a joke. That was a, that was a joke. That is, I actually just
[2238.34s -> 2248.94s]  got joked on right there. Don't stand there like me. You got it. You got it. You got to kill that.
[2249.90s -> 2256.36s]  Kill it. What are you doing? Shoot it. Oh, come on. Are you fucking kidding? That's why he wasn't
[2256.36s -> 2261.72s]  shooting. No, he's, it's, it's not real. He's, this motherfucker is infected the whole time.
[2262.28s -> 2279.29s]  He just wasn't even shooting the gun. The medic is scripted. I knew it. I, oh my God, I hate this so
[2279.29s -> 2285.78s]  much more than anything. You know, like the, like, like all bald because mad, whatever the fuck that
[2285.78s -> 2314.23s]  meme is. Oh, it's happening right now. You, you shot me with a shotgun from that far away and it
[2314.23s -> 2377.90s]  did that much damage. Who are you? I hate this game. Okay. I got it, right? I got it. I got it. I had
[2377.90s -> 2386.55s]  to. I had to. You saw the explosion. I was even past it. Like I, this is just, why is this in the
[2386.55s -> 2400.25s]  game? It's just there to be annoying. Dude, it even made the explosion on it. It even did the,
[2400.25s -> 2405.29s]  it exploded thing and it's still there. You have to be within like 10 feet for those things to be
[2405.29s -> 2423.40s]  destroyed. What on earth? What on earth would, what on earth? What were they thinking? Because
[2423.40s -> 2430.44s]  now I have to run forward and spawn all the enemies and then shoot a grenade and then get
[2430.52s -> 2445.27s]  swarmed. This has to be another way to do this. That has to be. Can I like bait the swarm?
[2475.02s -> 2543.82s]  This is fucking dumb. I can't even aim down. This is dumb. D-U-M-M. Is this just never going to stop?
[2543.82s -> 2549.02s]  Because every time I run for it, the big guy is right there and then he blocks, you can't run by
[2549.02s -> 2600.54s]  him. So I have to turn around. You can run. I can't. It's scripted. What kind of script is this?
[2600.54s -> 2609.06s]  Just run and gun with the SMG. Don't work. I tried it four days ago. Rare Pepe body lotion. Just
[2609.06s -> 2614.34s]  gave five. Thank you for the five subs. Rare Pepe body lotion. Appreciate it. And don't be that way.
[2615.14s -> 2624.15s]  Also gave five subs. Is there like a way just to exploit this part? Because this feels,
[2624.15s -> 2628.47s]  this feels like a weight. This feels like a thousand pound weight on my chest.
[2629.19s -> 2665.74s]  I don't want to do this all again. How do you cheat? I would love to cheat right now.
[2666.46s -> 2693.82s]  Ask your older brother. I just don't have done it in a way. Max Games was a mistake. Thank you,
[2693.82s -> 2703.67s]  Max Games. I'm putting this on easy. I don't care. I'm putting this on the easiest difficulty.
[2705.18s -> 2710.55s]  I don't think I care about my ego taking a hit for not being able to go through this
[2710.55s -> 2719.66s]  fucking bullshit staircase and the thing. In fact, I don't even know what the hell this does.
[2720.54s -> 2740.46s]  This makes this, this is like auto aim, right? This is actually making it harder.
[2741.10s -> 2768.12s]  This makes, this is worse. It's trying to aim at them and I'm so close to the end of this game.
[2768.12s -> 2800.18s]  I just want to beat it. It's trying. Heal me. I'm not using a mouth pack.
[2801.78s -> 2846.25s]  What just happened to me? What happened to me? I just landed and got hurt. Remember this is all
[2846.25s -> 2866.74s]  canon. Oh, I would retroactively get rid of that. You coming out or what? What are you doing?
[2866.74s -> 2895.11s]  This game is torturing Jeremy. I mean, it's, I was having fun. It was like eight and a half
[2895.11s -> 2915.14s]  hours of a fun game. And then this part is just stupid. It was, it was. This is Mario,
[2915.14s -> 2920.71s]  this is not Mario tennis levels. I haven't, I haven't like talked shit to somebody I don't
[2920.71s -> 2931.16s]  know online. Just watch a play through to figure it out. I shouldn't have to watch like the speed
[2931.16s -> 2937.24s]  run where the guy has played this game 4,000 times to be able to know how to play through once.
[2938.90s -> 2962.28s]  What? I shouldn't be able to do this to do it. All right, let's go. Let's do it again.
[2963.00s -> 2969.26s]  Now comes to some of the toughest fighting you'll do in the entire game. When you drop out of the
[2969.26s -> 2973.10s]  ductwork, Koman will run by or just behind you. He'll run all the way up to the top of the ramps.
[2973.10s -> 2975.74s]  When you hit the ground, quickly give him a weapon to follow him. Once you reach the top,
[2975.74s -> 2984.34s]  have him follow you and fight any troopers on the ramps. But that's, that's what I'm, I did that
[2984.42s -> 2991.69s]  already. But then I have to kill him and that sucks. I literally need him until he turns
[2992.41s -> 3019.58s]  and it goes to shit. What are you fucking aiming at game? Auto aim in a tunnel.
[3023.80s -> 3034.60s]  Fuck. Get over here. Don't run by me. Shut up. Take a machine gun now. Let's go.
[3035.88s -> 3055.85s]  Follow me. Fight. Fight. Shoot. Heal the fuck out of me right now. Heal me.
[3057.02s -> 3066.14s]  Oh. Heal me. Heal me. You're a medic. Please. He's already turned. It's already over.
[3069.45s -> 3106.84s]  He just standing still like an asshole. Hurry up. Go. Help me please. Where are you?
[3117.05s -> 3143.13s]  Where are you? Get over here. Turn. Heal me please. I have no bullets.
[3143.13s -> 3167.40s]  Fight. Fight. Fight. What is even hurting you that much? What the fuck just happened?
[3168.44s -> 3208.89s]  It all goes to shit here every time. He's dead. Good. Give me my gun back.
[3210.41s -> 3218.76s]  You have any health packs on you or anything? It doesn't stand up, right?
[3222.25s -> 3240.31s]  Steam. I'm going to, I'm going back to the shotgun. Okay. Now it's this part. I get swarmed, right?
[3241.27s -> 3303.22s]  No, it's the, these guys trying to beat this. I just got so mad at that person that beeped.
[3303.22s -> 3316.39s]  That was like a, the fuck did you say? What happened? That was a direct hit.
[3316.39s -> 3333.59s]  Somebody fucking help me. Nobody help me. Nobody help me. Three hits needed. No, that's not true.
[3334.33s -> 3345.35s]  That's not true. That can't be true. No, you can't. That can't be true. If I don't do it here,
[3345.43s -> 3352.62s]  I'm watching a YouTube video. Okay. This is the part where it goes to shit every single fucking
[3352.62s -> 3361.42s]  time. We're going to change. We're going to change that. I'm going to, okay. We're going to make a
[3361.42s -> 3371.85s]  wall of fire right here. I'm going to, I don't know what I'm going to do. I get, I run. No,
[3371.85s -> 3379.72s]  I don't have any idea. Should I watch a video? Yeah. Timed that so well. It's like, it's,
[3379.72s -> 3385.32s]  the hit box is so big and it doesn't stop. I did, I didn't do anything wrong there.
[3387.26s -> 3406.46s]  I'm watching a video. What's this called? Uh, the thing, stupid staircase, the thing staircase.
[3407.82s -> 3423.61s]  What would he call it? Winding staircase. Uh, the thing staircase game spiral, the thing spiral
[3424.66s -> 3442.31s]  staircase. Somebody already has a video. It's a ramp. Okay. The Sims four is I'm getting the
[3442.31s -> 3451.16s]  Sims four open chat that what a brilliant fucking mind you have. Seriously. I'm like, I can't alt
[3451.16s -> 3456.20s]  tab. What a brilliant mind. I'm going to open up the chat, but I'm going to be logged in twice.
[3456.20s -> 3470.39s]  Am I going to get like, you've been hacked? Can I do this? Okay. All right. Let me see it.
[3470.39s -> 3487.75s]  Can I even open this? Okay. I'm opening it. Let me just take a look. The thing any percent. No,
[3487.75s -> 3492.66s]  I don't want the speed run. I don't want the speed run. I don't even know what to look.
[3494.02s -> 3521.78s]  Okay. Hold on. I'm looking, did you just hear that sigh? Okay. So he shoots, he just shoots
[3521.78s -> 3528.79s]  everything and then he, and then he gets angry. And this is a speed runner by the way. See
[3529.59s -> 3540.26s]  Oh shit. I'm shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting,
[3542.98s -> 3550.47s]  stealing. No, I'm just trying to see what to do from an expert. Wait, what's he aiming at?
[3550.47s -> 3561.38s]  Are he runs by? All right. What do you do here? You can shoot them. You can shoot them. You can
[3561.38s -> 3569.10s]  shoot them. You can shoot them, but there's no feedback that that's possible. Are you kidding me?
[3569.10s -> 3587.14s]  Don't even say that. Don't tell me this is real. I shot that with the hunting rifle like 10 fucking
[3587.14s -> 3592.50s]  times. There's no spark. There's no feedback. Your bullets disappear into the wall just like
[3592.50s -> 3606.10s]  they do over here. This feedback here. Unbelievable. Okay. I'm going to go bait the fucking big guy.
[3606.10s -> 3669.59s]  Let's go. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Stop steaming. Yes. Yes. All right. Fucking hold on.
[3675.51s -> 3724.42s]  Where is it? What's up? Well, you just know, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[3724.42s -> 3736.97s]  no, no, no, no, no, no. There's another one. I just go, go, go, go, go, go. Just go. Just go.
[3737.69s -> 3761.62s]  Is it dead? Is it dead? I'm going to pass out. I think I'm having a heart attack. Okay. I think
[3761.62s -> 3776.42s]  I'm fine. This is a small heart attack. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my

[6498.16s -> 6507.22s]  technology at a reasonable pace cool the anti-thing virus is proving to be our
[6507.22s -> 6510.86s]  finest work to date none of this could have been possible without the fine
[6510.86s -> 6522.24s]  people I work with on this groundbreaking project all right that

[6588.70s -> 6592.66s]  retreated and died or whatever I don't know I've informed security and they
[6592.66s -> 6600.57s]  are investigating the beast has friends the security team is dead and I can't
[6600.57s -> 6609.66s]  find anything to defend myself with it everyone is reading this somebody
[6609.66s -> 6615.96s]  grabbed him when he was typing somebody just like he was they got his laugh okay

[6661.39s -> 6671.14s]  no no this probably opens open door to testing range how the hell do I do that
[6671.14s -> 6687.68s]  open the door to the testing range did I miss something in this room back here
[6687.68s -> 6702.14s]  like this a computer or something no I don't think there's anything I missed
[6702.14s -> 6711.66s]  and this is a one of the consoles up here can I touch anything with this

[7119.54s -> 7129.56s]  good and there's a safe point in here too so that's great that means I can
[7129.56s -> 7141.21s]  give you more than that take more ammo you should be good what is this is it
[7141.21s -> 7145.11s]  like a grenade launcher or something that's a microscope I thought this was
[7145.11s -> 7148.03s]  a scope I thought it was a fucking attachment I didn't think it was a
[7148.03s -> 7158.62s]  microscope whatever okay and how do we get these doors open that's fun what a
[7158.62s -> 7165.04s]  fun journey this is gonna be I don't know this door doesn't open this door
[7165.08s -> 7190.18s]  doesn't open there is this my stream froze hit the refresh button okay that
[7190.18s -> 7195.86s]  powers this room from me to be able to okay there's that okay that thing is in
[7195.86s -> 7208.71s]  here not that concerning to me but this on the other hand oh shit would you look
[7208.71s -> 7225.48s]  at that just kill it all first anything else that's a giant cannon it's got to
[7225.52s -> 7255.09s]  go I needed to you need to check check for mimics all right hold on save the
[7255.09s -> 7261.27s]  game the weapons door is now open it's down here right right wait wait wait
[7261.27s -> 7269.90s]  wait wait don't just go in there was the safe point over here yep okay safe point
[7269.90s -> 7275.69s]  is over here yep okay I can't with you to turn now because you've all your
[7275.69s -> 7286.43s]  usefulness is gone key card what is that a key to one of the doors it is a giant
[7286.43s -> 7307.10s]  cannon I was right I was actually correct so now I have the key to open
[7307.10s -> 7319.12s]  this door you imbecile but you know what I like it that you're stupid because it
[7319.12s -> 7336.60s]  makes so I can beat this game easier oh hi okay so what's in here there are
[7336.60s -> 7345.39s]  grenades in here I'm not gonna hit myself with these grenades fire grenade
[7351.30s -> 7369.51s]  this is really fucking messy all right I I guess I'm just gonna shoot him round
[7369.51s -> 7387.88s]  in a circle and fire I think let me use a stun grenade oh I forgot you guys are
[7387.88s -> 7402.50s]  here fuck shoot him all right so how the fuck does this work so I'm gonna stun
[7402.50s -> 7408.23s]  him and then I have to kill the thing can you please come in here with me get
[7408.23s -> 7436.18s]  in here why am I on that what he's fucking how is he hitting me this is
[7436.18s -> 7464.08s]  fucked up the key what hold on there's a key in here we get to fight another
[7464.08s -> 7473.52s]  boss that makes no fucking sense oh I thought that was bad guys okay kill the
[7473.52s -> 7499.66s]  soldiers and say that's a good idea okay so you can't really go anywhere I'm
[7499.66s -> 7516.83s]  gonna try to not I mean if I throw a grenade the things gonna open fuck you
[7516.83s -> 7572.78s]  don't even have what the I do it's a ground on fire I'm dead
[7572.78s -> 7585.65s]  it's spam stun grenades but I yeah yeah but I have to heal too and I can't put
[7585.65s -> 7590.30s]  this on it's like they have to get the so I'm just gonna run to the back of the
[7590.30s -> 7605.80s]  room but every time I switch okay let's try this what are you doing that's done
[7605.80s -> 7622.50s]  I have a girl fucking ridiculous and I love it automatically puts me it

[7667.10s -> 7684.59s]  the broken thing to do third boss fight which is a giant tentacle I'm saying
[7684.59s -> 7687.79s]  there's it's seemingly no safe place for you to hide without getting hit by the
[7687.79s -> 7690.67s]  boss forcing to keep moving around dodges there's actually a very easy way
[7690.67s -> 7695.91s]  to prevent this how we stand literally so you know so you have to stand
[7695.91s -> 7714.64s]  literally right underneath them is the only way I just want everyone to be
[7714.64s -> 7743.59s]  aware of this this is what we like to call I can't what he won't even say it's
[7743.63s -> 7786.65s]  a bad program good point don't swing at me watch this can't reach so now light

[8035.64s -> 8038.40s]  the thing just spins around in a circle and you're gonna get killed every time
[8038.40s -> 8043.48s]  the thing you light it on fire and it just goes in a blender in a circle is
[8043.48s -> 8047.40s]  there a reason why they decided to make every boss fight in a tiny fucking room
[8047.40s -> 8053.92s]  why are we in this small room together why do we have to be in this in every
[8053.92s -> 8061.71s]  boss fight has to be a fucking shoebox it's maddening it doesn't make any
[8061.71s -> 8073.21s]  fucking sense why do we have to be in such a small area don't don't light them
[8073.21s -> 8079.02s]  on fire well I have to that's the only way I can progress I can't progress any
[8079.02s -> 8087.73s]  other way just use normal weapons I did I was almost a 12 slug magazines on this
[8087.73s -> 8094.63s]  motherfucker how many do you want how many slug
[8094.63s -> 8106.44s]  magazines you want me to do use all why is it why are you doing this why are
[8106.44s -> 8124.14s]  you doing this health-based or time-based um I guess I could just sit
[8124.14s -> 8146.72s]  here kill the other dude first I mean I can't I can't move though I fucking
[8146.72s -> 8169.70s]  can't move if I move I'm gonna get hit I think it's stupid why do you pick the
[8169.70s -> 8175.58s]  stun gun every single fucking time when I'm just trying to cycle why do you
[8175.58s -> 8188.84s]  have to do that it's a bad idea that's a really bad idea because now I have to I
[8188.84s -> 8202.24s]  think spawned in here don't fucking you dare oh my god please I'm out of health
[8202.24s -> 8237.66s]  facts now if this is on easy do not use fire what if I run out of bullets I have
[8237.66s -> 8250.20s]  to finish it with fire so I'm so fucked how do I do because when I light them on
[8250.20s -> 8259.94s]  fire here I am absolutely 100% guaranteed to take like half health just
[8259.94s -> 8263.50s]  stun him throw but will he get stunned if I throw this into the wall back here
[8263.50s -> 8295.92s]  like but this is gonna hit me it's gonna hit me why did I move cuz I was gonna
[8295.92s -> 8307.40s]  get hit by the grenade oh my god this shit mmm my goodness it's fucking
[8307.40s -> 8314.20s]  ridiculous when you enter the room run along the middle seam of the floor to
[8314.20s -> 8317.86s]  the junction to the fourth or fifth row of tiles deep into the room you'll be
[8317.86s -> 8320.94s]  in an excellent spot from the boss because it can't hit you shot and till
[8320.94s -> 8330.75s]  you damage it to red shoot imagine just fighting a boss imagine just fighting a
[8330.75s -> 8335.89s]  fucking boss what was that again go to the fourth tile in the room and take two
[8335.89s -> 8351.00s]  steps to the right what was the middle seam go through the middle seam of the
[8351.00s -> 8364.28s]  room and then then what the hell happened use flame grenade and run away
[8364.28s -> 8373.87s]  this boss can only be killed by fire but can be damaged middle seam of the floor
[8373.87s -> 8378.79s]  to the junction of the fourth or fifth row of tiles you'll be in an
[8378.79s -> 8383.47s]  excellent spot from the boss because it can't hit you so the fourth or fifth row
[8383.47s -> 8392.63s]  of tiles let's go I'm gonna go to the full one two three four fourth or fifth
[8392.63s -> 8398.81s]  junction of tiles this is one two three four fifth junction of tiles I mean can
[8398.81s -> 8404.55s]  I move on the junction of tiles no I have to stay in the scene I guess and now
[8404.59s -> 8420.39s]  I'm gonna die so what's the next part is just damage him a bunch but this guy's
[8420.39s -> 8430.15s]  gonna get out shoot him and then use a fire grenade and run away but then I
[8430.15s -> 8437.99s]  gotta deal with this dickhead shoot it to red yeah I could hold on I'm gonna
[8437.99s -> 8447.01s]  show you something no because I downloaded a patch to make it so I could
[8447.01s -> 8462.16s]  use hold on okay so I have a patch that lets me use the mouse it's not a it's
[8462.16s -> 8472.37s]  not a mod it's an official patch so it's already red I just shoot like four
[8472.37s -> 8481.36s]  times so it's ready it's ready now so it's like you shoot it five times and
[8481.36s -> 8489.34s]  now I use fire kill the other guy use flame grenade and run hold on I gotta
[8489.34s -> 8492.74s]  like check I can't like even move my hand do you understand like this is I
[8492.74s -> 8510.61s]  can't even move the mouse now it wants me to do page up and page down okay so
[8510.61s -> 8515.41s]  now how much I don't know how much health I have fire grenade and then
[8515.41s -> 8521.95s]  fucking run kill other guy first wait kill other dude first then use the
[8521.95s -> 8528.37s]  grenade because it'll get out of the I kill I keep I have to move fire grenade
[8528.37s -> 8605.47s]  let's go now you just broke out without even I'm on the I'm on the junction I'm
[8605.47s -> 8617.38s]  on the correct junction of tiles the AI doesn't know okay all right wait a
[8617.38s -> 8626.10s]  minute burn burn burn burn I'm just gonna burn fuck okay forget about
[8626.10s -> 8636.65s]  throwing grenades I'm gonna I need to go immediately to the machine gun
[8636.65s -> 8668.84s]  please oh my god supposed to be red it was supposed to be red why was it not

[12847.43s -> 12852.97s]  games that like the you go to blockbuster and you rent this game at the first like six the first
[12852.97s -> 12857.69s]  like five to six hours are like great oh that was awesome we've rented the thing and then you have
[12857.69s -> 12868.90s]  to return it don't get a late fee for this one you know I'm saying just play the first like four
[12868.90s -> 12874.02s]  hours of it it was good the first like four to six hours just pretend and bring it back to blockbuster

[13272.31s -> 13289.27s]  it was just the start it was the two chords and edit that's how we get it the game ending
[13289.27s -> 13301.43s]  ruins the movie ending why did it give me a huge stockpile of weapons what was my least favorite
[13301.43s -> 13322.41s]  part uh all of today give or take look at the link all right hold away that might be like a secret
[13322.41s -> 13336.79s]  after credit scene hold on wait wait wait what does it after credit scene this isn't marvel
[13337.51s -> 13357.11s]  this is before marvel the thing came out in the 50s okay what are you linking let's see what it
[13357.11s -> 13384.01s]  looks like I know that you like separated my eyes you separated my eyes look you took my eyes and
[13384.01s -> 13390.46s]  you like separated them a little bit it's not that's not right I'm telling you these are not
[13390.46s -> 13396.62s]  real images you went like this and you shaved shaved shaved and then you like pulled back a
[13396.62s -> 13412.63s]  little and then you like made the bridge of my nose bigger oh my god we're gas lighting him
[13415.14s -> 13427.96s]  oh well that was the thing it was worth playing except for the last three hours but I did it
[13427.96s -> 13434.20s]  I got to the end scale of one to ten the first six hours was like an eight in the last
[13435.00s -> 13453.03s]  five or six hours was like a four now do it on hard I did do it on hard absolute quality
[13455.21s -> 13461.85s]  now play the outer worlds uh so here's let me wait I gotta talk we gotta talk about a few things here
[13463.05s -> 13472.34s]  so as of the oh man this is I'm gonna sit down for this one so all personalities voices are
[13472.34s -> 13485.62s]  impersonated okay uh so I the Halloween stream is gonna be on the 31st it's gonna be fairly
[13485.62s -> 13493.48s]  elaborate if you have anything that you like to suggest right that you for secret slime actions
[13494.34s -> 13500.42s]  that channel is going to be closed on the 28th there's not going to be any more time to do it
[13500.42s -> 13505.62s]  because after 28th I need to compile with the people that are helping me produce this whole
[13505.62s -> 13514.26s]  thing all the actions and get them into a template for the stream and I can't see them I cannot be
[13514.26s -> 13520.98s]  looking at them how do we pick and we vote for them you don't I just want a shitload to pull from
[13520.98s -> 13527.66s]  so then there's a ton of options how many per round that is to be determined probably probably
[13527.66s -> 13534.76s]  we'll do like one or two per round until we get later on to a point where there's like some upwards
[13534.76s -> 13542.28s]  of like five to ten going on at the same time so this also means because this was kind of short
[13542.36s -> 13546.60s]  notice and the production team that did the carnival was doing is helping me do this too
[13546.60s -> 13554.12s]  they're doing they're doing all the production stuff it was too soon to do this in Vegas so
[13554.76s -> 13562.15s]  I'm going back to the east coast as of the this coming week here so I'm going back to the east
[13562.15s -> 13568.47s]  coast and I'm going to kind of do a two birds at one stone scenario where I go visit my family
[13571.48s -> 13575.40s]  so I'm going to visit my family because I haven't seen a lot of them in a long time some of my family
[13575.40s -> 13581.16s]  I haven't seen some of my family members and some of my friends in just over a year so I was in
[13581.80s -> 13587.32s]  Boston like three or four I think four months ago whatever it was maybe for a day or two
[13587.32s -> 13591.32s]  trying to remember when the exact day was but I really only had like one or two days there
[13592.47s -> 13598.87s]  so I'm going to go down there do the stream so I won't be around next week go down there do the
[13598.87s -> 13609.59s]  stream and then I'm going to stay for a few days and then come back so take a hot air balloon back
[13609.59s -> 13614.55s]  it takes too long I'm going to hide this tape when I'm finished if none of us make it at least
[13614.55s -> 13625.48s]  there'll be some kind of a record but yeah that's so I'm not the the Halloween stream is not going
[13625.48s -> 13630.28s]  to be here not going to be in Vegas I'm going to be traveling for it and that's pretty much all I
[13630.28s -> 13637.24s]  wanted to say also another important thing to remember is I still have
[13638.20s -> 13641.24s]  the shooter blade and shooter blade 2 in fact they're right here
[13643.10s -> 13653.11s]  that is something that I want to do probably I kind of I don't know if I want to start that's
[13653.11s -> 13656.87s]  the thing about starting something like the Outer Worlds I know I have to play the Outer Worlds
[13656.87s -> 13665.94s]  because it's Fallout New Vegas just again but different I want to play it but before starting
[13665.94s -> 13674.41s]  the Outer Worlds I think I'm going to wait till I get back from the Halloween stream because I
[13674.41s -> 13678.81s]  don't want to just play it for like one day and then disappear for three days do the Halloween
[13678.81s -> 13687.50s]  stream and then come back three days later so we'll do tomorrow we'll do the shooter blade and
[13687.50s -> 13692.52s]  shooter blade 2 because they're classic uh they're classic video games and might as well
[13692.52s -> 13697.64s]  get rid of the rest of the ps1 stuff that's here and we'll see how that takes us see how we go
[13697.64s -> 13704.41s]  from there sire I also have siren that's another one shit that's right I gotta do that before
[13704.41s -> 13710.60s]  Halloween I don't shooter blade and shooter blade 2 won't take that long oh fuck siren's like a 30
[13710.60s -> 13721.75s]  hour game whatever fucking happy Halloween Thanksgiving whatever shit this I mean I've
[13721.75s -> 13726.95s]  applied like four times all right and that is going to be the end of this stream but it's not
[13726.95s -> 13730.47s]  because we're going to go back uh this is going to turn into a just a chill
[13731.67s -> 13735.51s]  session we're going to do the bits that I missed from a couple days ago three four days ago
[13738.52s -> 13744.60s]  uh let me just I'm gonna hide this tag when I'm finished if no stream is officially over as of
[13744.60s -> 13824.10s]  right now so let's go over the bits that we missed and I will be right back see you guys in a minute
[13824.10s -> 13841.18s]  all right we can get started here with the outro I can't even tell if this is still broken or not
[13843.00s -> 13850.63s]  because there's been such insane gifted subs I think this is from a few days ago but so because
[13850.63s -> 13854.71s]  we're doing two streams worth of bits and one of the that last this last stream was nine and a half
[13854.71s -> 13860.95s]  hours so we're going to try to go through these at a decent pace and I always say that all the time
[13862.07s -> 13871.19s]  but it has to happen now because it has to two hours later no no no no no no what's happening
[13871.19s -> 13877.32s]  909 see you in like see you in like 35 minutes all right how about that how's that sound anyways
[13877.32s -> 13882.36s]  this is from a few days ago I didn't do these I missed them I had to go I streamed for too long
[13882.36s -> 13888.12s]  and my stomach was all fucked up so here we are now uh we had 250 bits from Peaceful Haley they
[13888.12s -> 13891.88s]  said hey Jeremy how you doing hope all was well just wanted to ask if you're planning on going
[13891.88s -> 13901.32s]  to Galaxy's Edge at Disney uh probably not anytime soon I know many people are very happy
[13901.32s -> 13905.88s]  with it right now but I hope for the last one anyways have a good stream talking about building
[13905.88s -> 13912.14s]  a lightsaber oh shit you can build you can build a lightsaber there like a real one well it's not
[13912.14s -> 13926.68s]  real but is it though those things are shit what uh probably not I don't have any plans in the
[13926.68s -> 13932.52s]  immediate future to go to Galaxy's Edge I kind of want to wait until nobody cares anymore
[13933.08s -> 13937.32s]  and then just get to go on all the rides and just get to eat all the food and not have to
[13937.32s -> 13945.91s]  wait in line for anything so I don't know if I go like somewhere 2020 but yeah I am interested

[16162.84s -> 16167.72s]  I always love the rumbles and after re-watching them with my sister uh apple shift I decided to
[16167.72s -> 16174.44s]  give real wwe a shot I started watching raw and immediately fell in love it's so fucking fun at
[16174.44s -> 16179.16s]  first I thought that the fact that it was all scripted makes it stupid but in reality it makes
[16179.16s -> 16184.04s]  it even more fun it's like theater with punching thank you so much for introducing this to me
[16185.30s -> 16195.19s]  everyone's gonna call me a boomer but you can watch all the old shit on youtube I think all
[16195.19s -> 16203.48s]  the attitude era stuff with stone cold the rock the undertaker cain that you want to watch that
[16203.48s -> 16211.67s]  mankind getting thrown off the goddamn roof they don't do shit like that anymore mankind
[16211.67s -> 16220.54s]  got thrown off the roof of the cage actually they really did it and it almost fucking killed
[16220.54s -> 16229.37s]  them yeah it was it was unbelievable that guy would uh what's if I could why can't I think
[16229.37s -> 16236.76s]  of his name Mick Foley it was ridiculous he just didn't give us he just didn't give
[16238.97s -> 16253.80s]  that guy was just legendary at doing crazy shit in that ring I think they've dialed it down
[16254.79s -> 16272.81s]  in the last 10 years or so but I don't know I've only seen a few things recently is there's a new
[16272.81s -> 16281.58s]  wrestling thing in town though isn't there that AEW isn't that the new hot thing right now is
[16281.58s -> 16286.30s]  AEW is like really starting to get people to come over and it's better than the wwe because the
[16286.30s -> 16294.18s]  wwe is like not as good anymore now speaking of wwe things that aren't good anymore can you believe
[16294.18s -> 16307.77s]  they even released 2k20 wwe I am so happy that we will probably never get a fucking wwe 2k game
[16307.77s -> 16316.15s]  ever again I hope not oh god I pray every single day yukes decided they were like no this is like
[16316.15s -> 16324.23s]  boring and sucks in his wicked shitty every year and they left so please everyone put your hands
[16324.23s -> 16331.03s]  together and pray that this the thing that yukes comes up with is like it used to be back in like
[16331.03s -> 16340.15s]  2013 2012 am I going to use 2k20 for the next drama rumble probably not because it's fucking
[16340.15s -> 16348.94s]  terrible I mean like bugs are funny but when they get like when the game can't even function if I
[16348.94s -> 16354.30s]  spend like two weeks or like a full week making wrestlers in that game and we can't get a rumble
[16354.30s -> 16370.07s]  to even work I'm not even sure that's worth doing and that shit's 60 bucks yuke isn't on the series
[16370.07s -> 16376.98s]  anymore no because they went to do their own thing they do make it funny though maybe I don't know
[16376.98s -> 16388.60s]  I'll I'll check it out but I don't know do 2k14 again I can't I would I just can't it's on the
[16388.60s -> 16396.76s]  PlayStation 3 and it's the last one that it was the last 2k game that was on the PlayStation 3
[16396.76s -> 16403.54s]  and it just chugs it doesn't it really is not supposed to even be on there it was the final
[16403.54s -> 16411.82s]  one that they stuffed as much bullshit into and it's just it it takes like 60 seconds to load hair
[16412.38s -> 16422.97s]  in that goddamn game if you have too many layers on a character I would but it was too it's too
[16422.97s -> 16434.98s]  painful to try to put to make a character anymore it's the effort that is respected plus I don't
[16434.98s -> 16442.42s]  have any of the old wrestlers anymore I mean I made like 60 people in the old 2k14 2k13 games
[16442.42s -> 16453.00s]  can you get it on ps4 I wish unless it's emulated but emulating a ps3 half of the games don't even
[16453.00s -> 16462.78s]  work more than that more than half actually I think I don't know I'll let me I'll see what
[16462.78s -> 16468.02s]  I'm gonna do but I'm glad you got into wrestling it's a really fun sport to watch

[17181.40s -> 17186.06s]  but I'll do it again just in case anyone has not heard it yet that you need to take care of
[17186.06s -> 17194.92s]  yourself first and I am not a priority for you take care of yourself first make sure you're
[17194.92s -> 17201.54s]  doing all right your life is going fine financially if you want to give me money I will absolutely
[17201.54s -> 17207.86s]  take it you know like I'm not gonna be like no don't but please please please make sure you're
[17207.86s -> 17219.69s]  taking care of yourself first I am not a priority for you I'm a broke ass student and check it out
[17219.69s -> 17226.84s]  no sub and you don't ever have to sub you never have to do that if you let me tell you the orange
[17226.84s -> 17234.20s]  bread if you never sub to this channel ever and you never give even a cent to this channel sorry
[17234.20s -> 17240.92s]  that's fine that's oh are you having do you are you having fun do you like watching the streams
[17241.72s -> 17248.41s]  do you have fun here good fuck it you don't have to you don't have to give this channel money
[17257.16s -> 17268.04s]  I think people understand that I hope they really do I'm not having fun you said you hate cars and
[17268.04s -> 17278.15s]  that's my favorite movie I like that one does it make us a monster if we never sub
[17278.87s -> 17288.36s]  why would that ever have why would I ever think that that why would I ever be like well you know
[17288.36s -> 17298.38s]  I mean you should sub no if you if you can't afford it if you can't afford to pay this stream
[17298.38s -> 17306.95s]  money then then don't just don't you still contribute to this stream even though if you
[17306.95s -> 17315.56s]  don't think so like think about it let's say I mean the streams have been the last
[17316.28s -> 17323.66s]  three or four months or so I mean there's been a lot of people here and even if you're not paying
[17323.66s -> 17330.30s]  money to the stream you're still contributing to the success of this stream does that make sense
[17331.43s -> 17334.23s]  so don't ever think somebody gifted you a sub
[17339.45s -> 17352.87s]  all right somebody gifted him a sub cool thank you I guess cool but anyways long story short
[17352.87s -> 17358.74s]  get off your fucking phone when you're driving a car don't do that and if you don't have the money
[17358.74s -> 17365.56s]  to pay this stream save it take care of yourself first take care of me somewhere somewhere like
[17365.56s -> 17368.92s]  down the bottom like you know if you have if you have still cash lying around you're like you know
[17369.08s -> 17381.85s]  fine fuck it take care of yourself first always back to the moral of the story but we also we had
