[1.72s -> 2.48s]  I did it. I'm good.
[3.98s -> 7.17s]  Hey, what would you guys don't know is before every stream,
[7.93s -> 11.09s]  with the mic muted, I sit here and I get ready. It's an old
[11.09s -> 14.70s]  theater technique, where you kind of sit, you hype yourself
[14.70s -> 17.38s]  up and you get yourself ready for the day and for the
[17.38s -> 22.72s]  performance. Everybody has their own thing that they do. Me, I
[22.72s -> 27.14s]  go like this. This is how we do it. This is how we do it. This
[27.14s -> 30.42s]  is how we do it. This is how we do it. And then I press start
[30.42s -> 35.96s]  streaming. I do it every single time.
[51.10s -> 55.78s]  Hi, guys. Welcome. I got we got some stuff to talk about. Do
[55.78s -> 64.57s]  you actually though? What do you think? Yeah, I'm something of
[64.57s -> 70.13s]  an actor myself. Talking stream, not a talking stream, but an
[70.13s -> 78.98s]  explanation stream. They're out there today. That must be like a
[79.02s -> 87.49s]  fucking rumor convention today. I'll tell you. Twitch has been
[87.49s -> 94.81s]  acting up today. Well, my thing that I want to talk about has to
[94.81s -> 99.53s]  do with the stream that was planned today. You said Twitch is
[99.53s -> 102.97s]  acting like a doofus. Well, Jeremy is acting like a doofus
[102.97s -> 114.90s]  too. Because, sorry to say this, scratch tickets are not sold in
[114.90s -> 119.53s]  Nevada. There is no state run lottery. There is no lottery.
[119.53s -> 123.76s]  There are no scratch tickets in the state of Nevada. It's one of
[123.76s -> 132.90s]  only six states in the country. So I can't buy scratch tickets.
[134.72s -> 143.37s]  There's too much gambling. So there are a few things here to
[143.37s -> 150.88s]  discuss that that was planned. Well, I just did this is coming
[150.88s -> 156.08s]  from remember, I'm a recent transplant to Las Vegas. I lived
[156.08s -> 160.83s]  in Massachusetts my whole life. And every gas station, every
[160.83s -> 164.03s]  convenience store just had scratch tickets, all of them.
[164.75s -> 167.43s]  Every single one. So I'm just used to seeing scratch tickets.
[168.69s -> 172.05s]  And I just assumed completely that they're just everywhere,
[172.05s -> 178.81s]  every state, every county. And they don't exist in this state
[178.81s -> 188.65s]  at all. So what here's a possible scenario, and I'm going
[188.65s -> 192.61s]  to tell you a possible scenario. It's not illegal for me to
[192.61s -> 198.38s]  scratch scratch tickets in the state of Nevada. But I cannot
[198.38s -> 202.58s]  buy them here and I can't cash them in here. So what I might
[202.58s -> 208.65s]  have to here's two possible scenarios. Scenario one, we
[208.65s -> 214.15s]  retroactively just say, every death in Sekiro was a dollar to
[214.15s -> 218.91s]  the Nevada Humane Society. $221 goes right to the Nevada Humane
[218.91s -> 226.29s]  Society. Okay, that's option one. Option two is have
[226.29s -> 233.71s]  somebody buy me $221 worth of tickets in Massachusetts, send
[233.71s -> 238.51s]  them to me. I scratch them here. And then when I go visit
[238.51s -> 243.97s]  Massachusetts, which I plan on doing in the next like 30 to 45
[243.97s -> 247.37s]  days, I have a plan to go visit my family. I cash them in there.
[251.29s -> 254.25s]  Because it's not illegal for me to actually scratch a ticket
[254.25s -> 263.24s]  here. I just can't I just can't do anything with it here. Go to
[263.24s -> 265.64s]  the California state line. Yeah, but the California state line
[265.64s -> 269.76s]  is still that that's like a three hour drive. It's like a
[269.76s -> 275.74s]  two hour. That's a boomer tapped tactic. I don't know. I'm not
[275.74s -> 277.58s]  sure what we're gonna do. I haven't figured it out yet. I was
[277.58s -> 280.30s]  very defeated this morning when I realized what was gonna happen.
[281.31s -> 284.96s]  But listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. And somebody
[284.96s -> 291.12s]  says just do it online. I think there's a I don't like gambling
[291.12s -> 295.86s]  online. I mean, I could do that. But I don't really I don't want
[295.86s -> 300.90s]  to do like online gambling. I feel like that's another level
[300.94s -> 304.02s]  up versus just kind of scratching scratch tickets for
[304.06s -> 308.47s]  charity kind of thing. I don't really want to go to like an
[308.47s -> 312.71s]  online slot vendor and just I don't know. I'm not comfortable
[312.71s -> 317.12s]  with it. I have nothing. I have no problem with gambling. I live
[317.12s -> 321.90s]  in Las Vegas. And I hit up casinos every so often, right. But
[321.90s -> 326.31s]  I don't really want to do it. But on stream. I don't really
[326.31s -> 329.74s]  want to. It's not necessarily about like promoting gambling,
[329.74s -> 333.66s]  but like, Oh, big win. I did it, guys. I don't know. It just
[333.70s -> 340.18s]  doesn't sit too completely well with me. So don't have a problem
[340.18s -> 347.01s]  with it. I just don't personally want to do that. But regardless,
[348.62s -> 353.45s]  that's how that stands today. 2020 hindsight should have
[353.45s -> 359.94s]  probably but why but why would I have tried to research that? You
[359.94s -> 362.78s]  know what I mean? Like our scratch tickets legal in Nevada.
[362.78s -> 365.94s]  It's the state it's a gambling state. This is the state of
[365.94s -> 373.91s]  gambling in the country. I but regardless, I can be dejected
[373.91s -> 377.03s]  all I want. But doesn't matter. Today was still German slots is
[377.03s -> 380.55s]  still on the table today. We're still gonna play that. If you
[380.55s -> 384.11s]  don't know what that is. Somebody in the community just
[384.11s -> 392.13s]  made an entire video game. And it's been working on it for a
[392.13s -> 396.74s]  long time. They've been given updates in discord. And there's
[396.74s -> 398.90s]  a lot of interesting things in it. Apparently, I don't I
[398.90s -> 401.30s]  haven't played it. So we're going to kind of experience it
[401.30s -> 406.34s]  together. And there's a lot of interesting things in it.
[406.34s -> 408.70s]  Apparently, it seems fun. It's apparently there's like over an
[408.70s -> 412.18s]  hour or two of content. So it's it's like a full on video
[412.18s -> 417.18s]  game. Actual dev and oh, I would assume that the actual dev in
[417.18s -> 423.11s]  the chat is an actual member of the community. So real dev in
[423.11s -> 426.86s]  chat. So we're not gonna we're doing that later. Because I
[426.86s -> 431.08s]  figured I'd rather play Mr. Mosquito, which is a game I've
[431.08s -> 435.08s]  been trying to kind of throw in for a while now. So play Mr.
[435.08s -> 438.26s]  Mosquito until we're kind of sick of it. However long that
[438.26s -> 441.18s]  takes, you know, maybe a couple hours, two or three hours, I
[441.18s -> 443.66s]  don't know, maybe an hour. Who knows? I might play the game
[443.66s -> 446.63s]  for 10 minutes and go I want to do something else. So
[446.63s -> 454.64s]  Jermisloft will come after Mr. Mosquito. It's not very long.
[454.64s -> 458.44s]  Yeah, but we'll see. So with that said, hopefully you guys
[458.44s -> 466.37s]  have listened to my whole spiel here. And we're going to start
[466.37s -> 470.07s]  off with Mr. Mosquito. This is an old game about being
[470.07s -> 473.19s]  mosquito in somebody's house. That's the whole game. There's
[473.19s -> 476.79s]  nothing else in it. You just have to try to drink blood from
[476.79s -> 482.10s]  people in a house. So we might as well just get it started.
[489.50s -> 494.54s]  Open crates? No, no, no, that's not the same. The whole idea
[494.54s -> 498.48s]  was I was going to donate the money to charity and if I open
[498.48s -> 501.96s]  like a hundred TF2 crates, what the hell am I going to do with
[501.96s -> 519.43s]  like 40 McDonald's shotguns? Flip them on the e-market. Yeah,
[519.43s -> 524.39s]  I'll get like 12 cents for each one of those like re-skinned
[525.31s -> 530.55s]  color. You know what I mean? It's like, that's bad. This is
[530.55s -> 533.83s]  blinding in here. That's a reference to one of my old
[533.83s -> 543.29s]  videos. Yeah, you picked up on it. It's from Fresh Games. You
[543.29s -> 546.29s]  wouldn't get two cents. Zoom computer create. What did that
[546.29s -> 550.34s]  say? This game contains... Okay, for a second, I just got a
[550.34s -> 557.86s]  little nervous because a bunch of people would... Caution! Why
[557.86s -> 559.90s]  are there so many warnings? When using insecticide, you should
[559.90s -> 562.18s]  not only read the directions, but you should also follow them
[562.18s -> 573.02s]  carefully. That was a couple of scary moments there. All right.
[574.15s -> 581.96s]  Mr. Mosquito, the Yamada's summer. Loud birds. Are you ready?
[587.69s -> 594.60s]  Welcome to the home of the Yamada family. It's summer. Do you
[594.60s -> 595.36s]  like summer?
[595.44s -> 596.88s]  That cat is just fighting on the roof.
[596.88s -> 601.60s]  Summer drives people crazy. And that makes them commit
[601.64s -> 603.04s]  terrible acts.
[603.44s -> 604.00s]  What?
[604.28s -> 609.68s]  Take the tiny harmless mosquito, for example. It doesn't
[609.68s -> 614.52s]  have enough time to do much during its one precious short
[614.52s -> 621.76s]  life. Yet with one swipe, a human can snatch such a priceless
[621.76s -> 624.68s]  life away without a second's thought.
[624.72s -> 626.28s]  Is this like mosquito propaganda?
[626.28s -> 628.28s]  I'm sure that you may already realize...
[628.28s -> 629.36s]  Mosquitoes suck.
[629.36s -> 635.16s]  ...that you are a mosquito. The insect that bites people and
[635.16s -> 641.32s]  makes them feel itchy. The insect that creates a trail of
[641.32s -> 646.92s]  swollen bites. As a mosquito, there is something that you
[646.92s -> 655.51s]  naturally have to do. You have to suck blood. You must suck and
[655.51s -> 660.95s]  store away as much human blood as possible in order to survive
[660.95s -> 667.75s]  the winter and see another spring. However, blood sucking is
[667.75s -> 669.75s]  accompanied with much danger.
[670.43s -> 671.03s]  I'm sure it is.
[671.07s -> 675.87s]  It may come as a surprise to you, but you're not welcome in
[675.87s -> 677.63s]  the Yamada family home.
[678.63s -> 680.11s]  She's been talking for a full day.
[681.15s -> 687.39s]  Because you make people feel itchy. Bear in mind that they
[687.39s -> 691.11s]  will go to great lengths to protect themselves from you.
[692.15s -> 697.11s]  Nevertheless, please enjoy your summer of blood sucking.
[698.30s -> 700.34s]  Is that a person just yelling or is it a crow at...
[700.82s -> 701.74s]  What the hell is that?
[702.66s -> 704.38s]  Oh, that's me. It's Mr. Mosquito.
[707.86s -> 709.58s]  Mosquito spread disease.
[712.29s -> 716.97s]  Yeah, they just bite, suck blood, reproduce, hurt you, hurt
[716.97s -> 720.35s]  your family. Start stage briefing for the next stage.
[720.79s -> 724.37s]  Change mosquito color. I want to get a color scheme. You still
[724.37s -> 728.01s]  only have one color. To win battles within the battle time
[728.01s -> 736.50s]  attack set. This is a mosquito. This looks like a woodpecker.
[736.94s -> 741.41s]  Okay. Stage.
[742.25s -> 744.01s]  This is Rena's room.
[744.89s -> 749.58s]  Rena is the daughter of the Yamada family. She went on a
[749.58s -> 752.98s]  school trip today, and she sprayed herself with bug
[752.98s -> 757.50s]  repellent. But that was some time ago. So it's likely to be
[757.50s -> 762.02s]  wearing off in some places. You should suck from those spots.
[762.54s -> 763.86s]  Good luck in finding them.
[765.52s -> 776.27s]  Okay. So how do I play?
[777.99s -> 781.63s]  You're too close to me. It's so hot today.
[785.90s -> 787.14s]  Am I? Are they looking at me?
[787.14s -> 790.06s]  It's time over here to take a family picture. I've been
[790.06s -> 794.58s]  looking forward to it. How about taking a picture of just
[794.58s -> 796.10s]  you and dad? I don't want to be in it.
[796.58s -> 800.13s]  What are you talking about? Why not?
[800.69s -> 801.49s]  Oh, they're looking at me.
[801.49s -> 803.97s]  I just want to see why we have to take the same old pictures
[803.97s -> 807.81s]  year after year. We take a picture every year. That's
[807.81s -> 810.57s]  enough of a reason. Back me up here, Kenichi.
[813.70s -> 815.46s]  Are they lying down or are they leaning in?
[815.46s -> 818.50s]  It's such a pain.
[822.39s -> 824.51s]  Let's not do that this year.
[824.55s -> 826.23s]  Are they lying down in like a triangle?
[826.63s -> 827.55s]  With their heads together?
[827.99s -> 829.51s]  It's because of me, isn't it?
[829.71s -> 832.03s]  You don't want to be in the photo with me, do you?
[839.98s -> 840.66s]  There's the crow.
[841.48s -> 844.12s]  I want nothing to do with this. I'm going to my room.
[847.92s -> 848.92s]  I'm so confused.
[849.36s -> 851.12s]  Okay. So they've spread out.
[868.60s -> 871.40s]  You've ruined another family gathering. Not yet.
[873.30s -> 880.67s]  So this bug spray in parts of the room. So that's me.
[881.39s -> 884.65s]  I'm so tired.
[884.89s -> 886.01s]  I'm huge.
[887.04s -> 889.72s]  If a mosquito was that big, I'm getting a baseball bat
[889.96s -> 893.04s]  and I will tear off drywall from my walls to get rid of that thing.
[893.64s -> 894.80s]  This is like a killer bee.
[899.92s -> 904.45s]  Stage one. I need to get two tanks of blood.
[905.56s -> 908.20s]  There is one EX. What?
[910.08s -> 911.28s]  I don't even know how to fly.
[912.40s -> 914.36s]  There's no... It didn't teach me anything.
[918.54s -> 921.48s]  L, R1? Okay, R1 is fly.
[922.37s -> 925.38s]  L1 is stop. Read the manual.
[925.42s -> 934.23s]  God damn it. Getting started.
[934.51s -> 939.10s]  Ouch. Set up your PlayStation 2 controllers.
[940.22s -> 941.36s]  Okay, ouch.
[941.36s -> 942.52s]  It's summer, hot and humid.
[942.52s -> 944.12s]  A mosquito is patrolling the Yamada house.
[944.12s -> 946.64s]  It must suck blood to survive, so it attacks the Yamada at every opportunity.
[946.92s -> 949.16s]  Mr. and Mrs. Yamada and their daughter Rina are sick of itching.
[949.48s -> 953.72s]  Every member of the family is ready to stand up and swat you to avoid those nasty bites.
[954.32s -> 957.00s]  This mosquito faces life and death battles on an hourly basis.
[957.44s -> 960.28s]  Okay. About insecticides.
[960.28s -> 963.00s]  God damn it. I forgot you had to read this shit back.
[963.00s -> 963.92s]  Seamen again.
[964.92s -> 969.93s]  When using insecticide in real life, be sure to refer to the manufacturer's instructions.
[969.93s -> 971.57s]  Why are they so concerned about that?
[972.33s -> 976.67s]  Do people just like... Okay, here we go.
[977.31s -> 981.05s]  Rear view. Okay, 180... R2 is 180 degree turn.
[981.77s -> 985.37s]  R1 is accelerate. L1 is decelerate and reverse.
[986.09s -> 989.87s]  Triangle is change camera angle and take off.
[990.47s -> 991.86s]  I'm just going to have this right here.
[992.62s -> 995.99s]  Circle is attack and stabilize.
[996.67s -> 998.27s]  X button is take off.
[999.15s -> 1000.55s]  Square is take off.
[1002.53s -> 1007.87s]  So R1, L1 and then circle.
[1009.56s -> 1010.32s]  Who fucking cares?
[1018.54s -> 1019.18s]  Can you see me?
[1038.22s -> 1040.26s]  Did I get crashed into her face?
[1040.58s -> 1041.10s]  What?
[1043.54s -> 1044.78s]  Attack all the points?
[1044.86s -> 1045.30s]  What?
[1045.58s -> 1047.62s]  I don't... I can turn the lights off?
[1053.98s -> 1054.90s]  I don't understand.
[1058.97s -> 1061.45s]  Why does she sound like she weighs 5000 pounds?
[1068.64s -> 1069.92s]  Why are we having a battle?
[1071.86s -> 1072.90s]  How do I attack?
[1083.28s -> 1083.78s]  Bite!
[1085.16s -> 1085.66s]  Bite it!
[1087.78s -> 1089.38s]  Circle is supposed to be attack.
[1097.84s -> 1098.34s]  Okay.
[1106.68s -> 1107.96s]  Attack and stabilize.
[1109.46s -> 1111.34s]  Accelerate. Select is not used.
[1112.06s -> 1114.54s]  Menu controls. Mosquito... All right, listen.
[1117.28s -> 1119.92s]  Push the left analog stick to point the view. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1119.92s -> 1122.08s]  Press R1 to speed up. L1 to slow down.
[1122.08s -> 1124.96s]  Press L1 button when stationary to reverse.
[1126.26s -> 1128.30s]  Move around. Yeah, okay.
[1129.06s -> 1130.98s]  Press the R2 button to perform 180s.
[1132.17s -> 1134.97s]  Lock on. A red frame highlights relax points,
[1135.61s -> 1138.89s]  blood sucking points and gimmicks in the room.
[1138.89s -> 1144.25s]  With the left analog stick, align the green lock on cursor with the red frames to lock on.
[1145.29s -> 1148.09s]  Press the circle button to attack a locked on target.
[1148.81s -> 1150.09s]  So I can't just do it anywhere.
[1150.97s -> 1160.68s]  Press the circle button to alleviate temporary loss of control when you crash into walls.
[1162.38s -> 1164.06s]  Push the right analog stick.
[1164.62s -> 1165.74s]  R3 button.
[1166.62s -> 1168.54s]  Once you land on a blood sucking point,
[1168.54s -> 1171.18s]  pierce your host's skin with a needle-like proboscis.
[1172.30s -> 1175.10s]  Rotate the right analog stick to suck blood.
[1176.28s -> 1179.48s]  To suck blood faster, rotate the right analog stick faster.
[1179.48s -> 1181.96s]  To suck slower, rotate slower.
[1181.96s -> 1184.84s]  Blood sucking causes your host's stress level to increase.
[1184.84s -> 1185.64s]  Jesus Christ.
[1199.58s -> 1200.70s]  Just redo it.
[1200.70s -> 1201.75s]  I'm not done.
[1206.92s -> 1209.72s]  So slowly stealth. I'm gonna turn the lights off.
[1211.16s -> 1213.14s]  So I'm gonna kill the lights.
[1213.70s -> 1214.58s]  So that you can't see.
[1220.82s -> 1222.34s]  And then it's R3.
[1233.83s -> 1234.71s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[1235.51s -> 1239.50s]  We're gonna hit the lights.
[1247.75s -> 1248.87s]  Suck the light bulb.
[1248.87s -> 1250.87s]  No, I'm gonna get like light bulb juice in me.
[1254.26s -> 1257.06s]  Okay, now that I had to read the instructional manual.
[1257.06s -> 1261.29s]  Let's turn the lights off.
[1261.29s -> 1266.60s]  Okay, here we go.
[1266.60s -> 1268.68s]  I'm gonna be careful.
[1268.68s -> 1271.19s]  So get the cursor in there. Lock on.
[1271.19s -> 1272.71s]  It's locked on. Let's decelerate.
[1280.58s -> 1281.70s]  I can't see anything though.
[1281.70s -> 1282.90s]  This is bad for me.
[1287.96s -> 1289.08s]  What did I just run into?
[1291.85s -> 1293.13s]  Where is that? I need a lock on point.
[1295.11s -> 1295.83s]  Lock on point.
[1309.69s -> 1310.49s]  What's the point of turning...
[1310.49s -> 1311.69s]  Okay, I see it.
[1319.78s -> 1320.50s]  Why would you just...
[1320.50s -> 1322.02s]  Okay, why would you sleep with the lights on?
[1335.32s -> 1336.20s]  Keep the ball in the blue.
[1346.20s -> 1347.00s]  This is a lot.
[1348.92s -> 1350.76s]  Area of the meter you can press.
[1350.76s -> 1351.40s]  What did that say?
[1351.96s -> 1357.14s]  How much blood am I gonna take?
[1363.51s -> 1364.47s]  Okay, two tanks.
[1365.67s -> 1366.23s]  Okay, let's go.
[1367.03s -> 1368.55s]  How was it the first time?
[1369.51s -> 1371.99s]  I hope you enjoyed your first blood suck.
[1372.63s -> 1373.75s]  Okay, that's fucking creepy.
[1375.35s -> 1378.49s]  Take all of it.
[1381.86s -> 1394.52s]  This is not a porn game.
[1394.52s -> 1397.08s]  Guys, on the back of the box,
[1397.08s -> 1398.04s]  I'm gonna read this to you.
[1398.04s -> 1398.52s]  Are you ready?
[1401.08s -> 1402.12s]  Mr. Mosquito.
[1403.16s -> 1404.68s]  Rated T for teen.
[1404.68s -> 1406.52s]  Published by Eidos Interactive.
[1407.67s -> 1410.07s]  Comic mischief, mild violence.
[1412.54s -> 1425.75s]  There's somebody in a tub on the back of this though.
[1425.75s -> 1428.47s]  Is this comic mischief?
[1429.19s -> 1429.99s]  I don't have any clothes on.
[1429.99s -> 1430.71s]  I gotta be careful here.
[1437.26s -> 1438.22s]  That's on the back of the box.
[1443.05s -> 1444.73s]  It's rated T for teen.
[1450.84s -> 1454.14s]  This is the Yamada's storeroom.
[1454.14s -> 1458.22s]  Rina's mother Kaneo is looking for their family albums.
[1459.32s -> 1463.16s]  The storeroom is full of toxic clothing inside.
[1464.68s -> 1468.20s]  Try to avoid the toxic air as you fly around.
[1468.20s -> 1468.76s]  No, you didn't.
[1478.38s -> 1479.74s]  No, you did not.
[1482.23s -> 1486.31s]  Look, how would it reflect off a PlayStation case?
[1487.64s -> 1488.44s]  Not possible.
[1491.62s -> 1493.22s]  It reflected off itself.
[1493.22s -> 1494.90s]  There's no way you guys saw anything.
[1495.46s -> 1500.58s]  Nice chest hair.
[1500.58s -> 1501.94s]  Let's see, I'm covered in chest hair.
[1511.26s -> 1512.14s]  I'm covered in chest hair.
[1513.98s -> 1514.54s]  It's on my legs.
[1514.54s -> 1515.66s]  I got chest hair on my back.
[1532.66s -> 1534.98s]  But if there's a mosquito here, you'll be next.
[1536.02s -> 1537.22s]  You must be kidding.
[1538.34s -> 1539.06s]  Why do all these...
[1539.06s -> 1541.86s]  I don't understand this whole heads in frame thing.
[1541.86s -> 1542.34s]  I'm looking for something.
[1544.20s -> 1545.08s]  What are you looking for?
[1551.48s -> 1553.16s]  All right, get fucked, Jerma.
[1553.16s -> 1554.04s]  You actually got me there.
[1567.16s -> 1569.48s]  No, you don't have to lip sync any animations.
[1569.48s -> 1569.96s]  That's true.
[1570.68s -> 1576.02s]  All right, you got your T-pose.
[1577.98s -> 1579.78s]  Why is this scary?
[1581.08s -> 1583.32s]  Stage two, look out for the poison in the air.
[1583.32s -> 1584.52s]  Suck two tanks of blood.
[1585.00s -> 1586.78s]  Well, Jesus.
[1590.54s -> 1591.42s]  We got first spot.
[1595.90s -> 1596.22s]  Ow.
[1598.34s -> 1599.30s]  Okay, easy.
[1601.62s -> 1603.78s]  You don't have any, like, points of interest.
[1606.18s -> 1606.58s]  Right here?
[1609.45s -> 1609.77s]  Battle.
[1623.77s -> 1625.77s]  What did I just do?
[1625.77s -> 1626.73s]  I don't understand.
[1627.45s -> 1629.45s]  I had to hit you in the stomach?
[1629.85s -> 1640.15s]  I got to hit you right in the forehead.
[1640.15s -> 1642.15s]  All right, I can't go up that high.
[1643.67s -> 1648.54s]  I have to hit you in a bunch of pressure points.
[1648.54s -> 1650.54s]  Oh, this is so dumb.
[1650.54s -> 1656.36s]  Watch out for the poison.
[1656.36s -> 1662.57s]  I, it's, I...
[1668.31s -> 1675.03s]  Got you, headshot.
[1675.03s -> 1681.48s]  Now what?
[1681.48s -> 1683.85s]  What the fuck is going on?
[1683.85s -> 1692.94s]  Where am I supposed to bite?
[1692.94s -> 1697.10s]  I don't see any marker.
[1697.10s -> 1699.10s]  There's no red marker.
[1699.10s -> 1705.11s]  Down there, got it.
[1705.11s -> 1706.23s]  Fuck that up.
[1706.23s -> 1708.20s]  What?
[1708.20s -> 1710.76s]  I pressed the button.
[1710.76s -> 1726.44s]  Where did...
[1726.44s -> 1729.70s]  Where did that marker go?
[1729.70s -> 1742.57s]  Hello? What?
[1742.57s -> 1744.57s]  Okay.
[1744.57s -> 1746.57s]  Why can I not do this?
[1746.57s -> 1748.57s]  Is it on the other leg?
[1748.57s -> 1750.94s]  Oh my god.
[1761.37s -> 1763.37s]  Why?
[1763.37s -> 1765.37s]  Which leg is this?
[1765.37s -> 1767.54s]  It's not this one.
[1777.05s -> 1779.05s]  Okay, I have another opportunity, apparently.
[1779.05s -> 1784.15s]  No, I don't.
[1784.15s -> 1792.47s]  Dude, what?
[1792.47s -> 1794.97s]  What?
[1794.97s -> 1797.40s]  What?
[1797.40s -> 1799.40s]  What?
[1799.40s -> 1801.40s]  What?
[1801.40s -> 1803.40s]  What?
[1803.40s -> 1805.40s]  What?
[1805.40s -> 1807.40s]  Lady, by the way, I don't think you should be in a closed
[1807.40s -> 1809.40s]  off room with a bunch of poison in it.
[1809.40s -> 1811.40s]  Get out of here.
[1811.40s -> 1813.40s]  You're breathing in all
[1813.40s -> 1815.40s]  these fumes.
[1815.48s -> 1817.48s]  Oh shit.
[1835.98s -> 1838.34s]  This lady is breathing in.
[1838.34s -> 1840.65s]  Just raid.
[1840.65s -> 1854.20s]  This is a nice porn game.
[1854.20s -> 1858.74s]  It's not a porn game.
[1858.82s -> 1862.86s]  Yes, it is.
[1862.86s -> 1864.86s]  This is not a porn game.
[1864.86s -> 1866.86s]  It's not a porn game.
[1866.86s -> 1868.86s]  This is not porn.
[1868.86s -> 1870.86s]  Stop this.
[1870.86s -> 1873.86s]  You're making me self-conscious.
[1881.86s -> 1883.86s]  Keep saying porn.
[1891.86s -> 1893.86s]  Don't worry, though.
[1893.86s -> 1896.17s]  Based on your actions,
[1896.17s -> 1898.17s]  you will have plenty of chances
[1898.17s -> 1900.17s]  to suck his blood.
[1910.02s -> 1912.02s]  If we're just gonna play this game,
[1912.02s -> 1914.02s]  this game was like $75.
[1914.02s -> 1916.02s]  Okay?
[1916.02s -> 1918.02s]  I've wasted a lot of money on these PlayStation 2
[1918.02s -> 1920.02s]  porn games, okay?
[1920.10s -> 1922.10s]  Get them out again?
[1922.10s -> 1926.58s]  You like doing that, don't you?
[1926.58s -> 1930.86s]  You've got an insect bite mark. It's swollen.
[1930.86s -> 1936.55s]  Oh dear.
[1936.55s -> 1939.43s]  It wasn't $75. It was like $50.
[1939.43s -> 1941.43s]  Rub some aloe on it.
[1941.43s -> 1943.43s]  Hate it.
[1943.43s -> 1945.43s]  I can't believe that's on there. You have to rub some aloe on it.
[1945.43s -> 1947.43s]  Honestly.
[1947.43s -> 1951.98s]  Is he working out at the gym?
[1951.98s -> 1953.98s]  This is a good gym playlist.
[1953.98s -> 1955.98s]  Next time you come home late, I won't say a word
[1955.98s -> 1957.98s]  about it to your father.
[1957.98s -> 1966.60s]  Really?
[1966.68s -> 1968.68s]  Default cartoon Tom and Jerry sound effects.
[1976.17s -> 1978.17s]  The horn.
[1978.17s -> 1980.17s]  I'm gonna lose my mind.
[1980.17s -> 1982.17s]  I'm gonna lose my mind.
[1982.17s -> 1992.73s]  I gotta stay focused.
[1992.73s -> 1995.86s]  What are you watching?
[1995.86s -> 1999.19s]  That's what was coming out of the TV.
[1999.19s -> 2002.14s]  What a wacky weather report.
[2002.14s -> 2004.14s]  Be careful of the air current coming from the air conditioner.
[2004.14s -> 2006.14s]  Suck three tanks of blood this time.
[2006.14s -> 2008.14s]  Right from the top of his head.
[2008.14s -> 2015.54s]  Let's get in there.
[2015.62s -> 2019.91s]  I'm bored.
[2019.91s -> 2024.84s]  Did he just punch himself in the face?
[2026.84s -> 2031.38s]  Stay focused.
[2031.38s -> 2035.99s]  Fuck.
[2035.99s -> 2039.96s]  Okay. Here it is.
[2039.96s -> 2044.57s]  Got it.
[2044.57s -> 2047.19s]  Three pints of blood.
[2047.19s -> 2050.78s]  What?
[2050.78s -> 2057.88s]  He just instantly killed me.
[2057.88s -> 2074.78s]  Why did I just instantly die?
[2074.78s -> 2076.78s]  You didn't do the...
[2076.78s -> 2081.56s]  You didn't counter it.
[2081.56s -> 2083.56s]  Wait for him to punch himself in the face.
[2085.10s -> 2087.10s]  After he punches himself in the face.
[2087.10s -> 2091.37s]  This is freaking me out.
[2091.37s -> 2098.60s]  I got it.
[2098.60s -> 2100.60s]  Telephone call.
[2100.60s -> 2105.53s]  Distraction.
[2105.53s -> 2119.53s]  He's gonna get up and answer the phone.
[2119.53s -> 2122.58s]  Put this in there.
[2122.58s -> 2124.82s]  Come on.
[2124.82s -> 2130.26s]  Why?
[2130.26s -> 2137.88s]  Why couldn't I do that?
[2137.88s -> 2142.04s]  Wait till he punches himself in the face.
[2142.04s -> 2147.22s]  He punches himself right in the mouth.
[2147.22s -> 2150.79s]  What?
[2150.79s -> 2153.67s]  Here it comes.
[2153.75s -> 2160.15s]  Punch in face.
[2160.15s -> 2167.24s]  What's wrong with me?
[2167.24s -> 2171.91s]  What's going on?
[2171.91s -> 2173.91s]  What?
[2173.91s -> 2181.02s]  Maybe not the head.
[2181.02s -> 2183.02s]  Maybe it's somewhere else.
[2183.02s -> 2191.53s]  My stress levels...
[2191.53s -> 2193.53s]  Their stress levels are too high.
[2193.53s -> 2198.58s]  He can hear you.
[2198.58s -> 2204.79s]  That's his stress level.
[2204.79s -> 2215.54s]  We gotta get in there quick.
[2215.54s -> 2217.54s]  He goes, I'm bored.
[2217.54s -> 2219.54s]  We gotta get in there.
[2219.54s -> 2221.54s]  Air current coming from the air...
[2221.62s -> 2223.93s]  That doesn't seem like it matters.
[2223.93s -> 2229.56s]  Here we go.
[2229.56s -> 2231.56s]  His stress is fine.
[2231.56s -> 2234.44s]  Get in there.
[2234.44s -> 2236.44s]  He's bored.
[2236.44s -> 2240.66s]  Stress is alright.
[2240.66s -> 2249.29s]  Easy.
[2249.29s -> 2252.04s]  Where's that indicator?
[2252.04s -> 2257.48s]  Oh my fucking god.
[2257.48s -> 2269.64s]  Is there anywhere else I can bite him?
[2269.64s -> 2272.33s]  Maybe the head is just not the one to do.
[2272.33s -> 2274.33s]  Can I get him in the foot?
[2274.33s -> 2276.33s]  Or in the ankle or something?
[2276.33s -> 2286.18s]  I think I have to distract him.
[2286.26s -> 2293.69s]  Let me see.
[2293.69s -> 2295.69s]  Oh, I'm gonna change the channel on him.
[2295.69s -> 2297.69s]  He's gonna get really mad about this.
[2297.69s -> 2303.70s]  Turn.
[2303.70s -> 2310.49s]  Okay, I'm high enough where I should be able to get an indicator here.
[2310.49s -> 2312.49s]  There it is.
[2312.49s -> 2318.30s]  God damn it.
[2318.30s -> 2324.44s]  Stress is fine.
[2324.44s -> 2328.92s]  Come on, give me the indicator.
[2328.92s -> 2335.43s]  Give it to me!
[2335.43s -> 2339.08s]  What are you doing?
[2339.08s -> 2341.58s]  There it is.
[2341.58s -> 2351.35s]  Okay, hold on.
[2351.35s -> 2353.35s]  He's stressed.
[2353.43s -> 2360.84s]  Got it.
[2360.84s -> 2362.84s]  Watch that stress level.
[2362.84s -> 2370.38s]  How many are there?
[2370.38s -> 2372.38s]  Three?
[2372.38s -> 2374.38s]  I'm not gonna get all three right now.
[2382.38s -> 2384.38s]  Don't do it.
[2384.38s -> 2386.38s]  What's his level like?
[2386.38s -> 2388.38s]  He's getting a little stressed.
[2388.38s -> 2390.38s]  I'm gonna back off.
[2390.38s -> 2392.38s]  Yeah, I'm backing off.
[2392.46s -> 2399.54s]  Oh!
[2399.54s -> 2401.54s]  I'm gonna turn the phone on.
[2401.54s -> 2404.42s]  Oh shit, he just turned on the AC.
[2404.42s -> 2408.97s]  He turned on the air conditioner somehow.
[2408.97s -> 2410.97s]  Where's the AC come from?
[2410.97s -> 2416.54s]  He's not gonna see me, right?
[2416.54s -> 2422.81s]  I can't get it from here.
[2422.81s -> 2427.03s]  The AC's off.
[2427.03s -> 2429.53s]  Let's get it.
[2429.53s -> 2431.53s]  What?
[2431.53s -> 2440.36s]  How?
[2440.36s -> 2443.43s]  Same deal. Far away.
[2443.43s -> 2445.43s]  The stress level should be good and manageable.
[2445.43s -> 2447.86s]  And three, two, one.
[2447.94s -> 2449.94s]  Last off.
[2449.94s -> 2452.57s]  He's good?
[2452.57s -> 2454.74s]  Give me one more.
[2454.74s -> 2456.74s]  And then tutorial dad is done.
[2465.88s -> 2467.88s]  They get more stressed if you don't keep it in the blue.
[2469.88s -> 2471.88s]  Don't swap me, please.
[2471.88s -> 2473.88s]  Thank god.
[2473.88s -> 2475.88s]  Alright, get up.
[2479.88s -> 2489.34s]  That was loud.
[2489.34s -> 2510.38s]  I did it.
[2510.38s -> 2512.38s]  Can I change my...
[2512.38s -> 2514.38s]  No, I only have one color.
[2536.38s -> 2547.13s]  Okay.
[2547.13s -> 2567.80s]  Just trying to get something ready here.
[2567.80s -> 2569.80s]  Just in case I need it.
[2586.78s -> 2594.14s]  I don't think I can...
[2594.14s -> 2604.18s]  Those have to see.
[2615.11s -> 2617.11s]  It's alright.
[2619.11s -> 2634.84s]  Let's make this quick.
[2634.84s -> 2664.39s]  Get out! Out! Out!
[2664.39s -> 2668.55s]  Alright, we're fine.
[2668.55s -> 2683.21s]  It's all, like, blurred out.
[2683.21s -> 2699.98s]  Don't look over here.
[2699.98s -> 2718.66s]  I keep hitting the bubbles, don't make those noises.
[2733.03s -> 2735.03s]  Just let me get all three.
[2737.03s -> 2739.03s]  I gotta get out.
[2739.03s -> 2741.03s]  Why is everybody so bored?
[2741.03s -> 2743.03s]  Give me this last one, then get out.
[2743.03s -> 2745.03s]  Out, out, get out, get out now.
[2745.03s -> 2771.38s]  Nope!
[2771.38s -> 2773.38s]  And when you pop a bubble, guys, it goes...
[2773.38s -> 2777.10s]  SHIT!
[2786.79s -> 2788.79s]  Get out.
[2788.79s -> 2845.53s]  Where is she?
[2845.53s -> 2851.29s]  Fuck you!
[2851.37s -> 2855.85s]  I only have a minute left?
[2855.85s -> 2860.71s]  Alright, no more jokes.
[2860.71s -> 2862.71s]  You can't even see anything anyways, who cares?
[2862.71s -> 2873.40s]  I can't see anything at all.
[2873.40s -> 2883.18s]  Right here, come on.
[2883.18s -> 2885.80s]  29 seconds.
[2885.80s -> 2888.10s]  Give me the indicator.
[2888.10s -> 2908.06s]  It's just a floating hair.
[2929.82s -> 2932.95s]  It looks so much worse.
[2933.03s -> 2946.34s]  Drink the bath water?
[2950.34s -> 2952.34s]  Like, as the mosquito, that would...
[2952.34s -> 2954.34s]  Mosquitoes don't need that.
[2954.34s -> 2956.34s]  Mosquitoes don't drink water.
[2975.19s -> 2977.19s]  Mosquitoes don't drink water?
[2977.27s -> 2979.27s]  Mosquitoes don't drink water, they drink blood.
[2979.27s -> 2981.27s]  There's water in blood.
[2985.27s -> 2987.27s]  Don't read chat right now.
[2987.27s -> 2989.27s]  Yeah!
[2989.27s -> 2991.27s]  I know!
[2993.27s -> 2995.27s]  This is how I feel, yeah, I'm here too.
[2995.27s -> 2997.27s]  This is how I feel reading chat right now.
[3013.37s -> 3018.25s]  I think that there is a mosquito in the house.
[3018.25s -> 3020.55s]  You think?
[3020.55s -> 3022.55s]  Go and buy some insecticide, Kanaeo.
[3022.55s -> 3024.55s]  And make sure it works.
[3024.55s -> 3028.55s]  No way that you could go and buy some yourself?
[3028.55s -> 3035.99s]  Mom, weren't you going to cook dinner now?
[3035.99s -> 3040.30s]  I'd like to eat potato cakes tonight.
[3040.30s -> 3043.88s]  Really?
[3043.88s -> 3045.88s]  Let's have potato cakes for dinner then.
[3045.88s -> 3047.88s]  That's great!
[3047.96s -> 3051.96s]  But mom, I'm not sure about the way you make them.
[3051.96s -> 3055.16s]  What are you saying?
[3055.16s -> 3057.16s]  There's nothing wrong with the way that I make them.
[3057.16s -> 3059.16s]  Well, okay.
[3059.16s -> 3061.16s]  I'm going to light a mosquito coil in the kitchen.
[3061.16s -> 3063.16s]  What?
[3063.16s -> 3065.40s]  Typical.
[3065.40s -> 3072.50s]  Ugh.
[3072.50s -> 3085.75s]  Nobody knew what they were saying.
[3085.75s -> 3087.75s]  That's weird.
[3087.75s -> 3095.75s]  What happened to my stream labs?
[3095.75s -> 3098.12s]  Dashboard!
[3098.12s -> 3103.56s]  There it is, okay.
[3103.64s -> 3106.33s]  Cooking.
[3106.33s -> 3110.34s]  Wow.
[3110.34s -> 3118.28s]  This mother is insane.
[3118.28s -> 3120.84s]  That was four or five front flips.
[3120.84s -> 3122.84s]  Without touching any of the shit.
[3122.84s -> 3125.08s]  Stay away from the mosquito coil fumes.
[3125.08s -> 3127.08s]  There are two blo-
[3127.08s -> 3129.26s]  Okay.
[3129.26s -> 3134.95s]  What did that even say?
[3134.95s -> 3136.95s]  The mom is a god gamer.
[3136.95s -> 3138.95s]  Is that a god gamer?
[3138.95s -> 3141.19s]  Or is-
[3141.19s -> 3143.19s]  What do you mean, god gamer?
[3143.19s -> 3146.84s]  Okay, I gotta get both knees.
[3146.92s -> 3149.99s]  She did a front flip.
[3149.99s -> 3158.82s]  What does that have to do with gaming?
[3158.82s -> 3161.90s]  Come on, let's see it.
[3161.90s -> 3166.18s]  It's right when she goes to the front of the sink.
[3166.18s -> 3168.18s]  Hold on, can I distract her with something?
[3168.18s -> 3170.18s]  Can I fuck with the hot dogs?
[3172.81s -> 3174.81s]  Only a god gamer could-
[3174.81s -> 3176.98s]  Alright, I have to get the feet.
[3176.98s -> 3179.16s]  So it's both feet.
[3179.16s -> 3181.72s]  How-
[3181.72s -> 3187.46s]  I'm gonna get killed here.
[3187.46s -> 3195.27s]  Alright, here we go.
[3199.96s -> 3201.96s]  How long does she do this for?
[3210.12s -> 3212.12s]  She's eventually gonna stop doing this pose.
[3214.12s -> 3216.12s]  Why would you do this pose for this long?
[3222.12s -> 3224.12s]  There's no way.
[3224.12s -> 3231.35s]  You still going?
[3231.35s -> 3236.22s]  Alright, there we go.
[3236.30s -> 3241.22s]  Okay, that's right.
[3241.22s -> 3250.89s]  Here we go.
[3250.89s -> 3252.89s]  Let's do the other one this time.
[3252.89s -> 3254.89s]  Actually, no, we're just gonna do it together.
[3256.89s -> 3259.06s]  They even feel it.
[3259.06s -> 3261.06s]  They go, ow.
[3273.06s -> 3275.06s]  That's it?
[3275.14s -> 3279.16s]  Now what?
[3279.16s -> 3281.16s]  What was the briefing? How many do I need?
[3281.16s -> 3284.62s]  Oh shit, careful.
[3289.03s -> 3297.42s]  The other one, okay.
[3297.42s -> 3302.41s]  Shouldn't be too hard.
[3302.41s -> 3304.41s]  Right there.
[3304.41s -> 3306.41s]  Really?
[3306.41s -> 3308.41s]  God damn it. Alright, it's-
[3308.41s -> 3311.27s]  I can get it.
[3311.27s -> 3314.79s]  What? I gotta go from the top.
[3314.79s -> 3316.79s]  Uh oh, bad news.
[3327.46s -> 3329.46s]  So I gotta go right in front.
[3329.54s -> 3334.15s]  What?
[3341.06s -> 3347.70s]  Why?
[3352.12s -> 3361.72s]  How did I fail that?
[3361.72s -> 3363.72s]  This is not a porn game!
[3363.72s -> 3375.75s]  Do I get an indicator of when she's gonna move?
[3389.75s -> 3391.75s]  One more.
[3401.75s -> 3403.75s]  Got it.
[3403.75s -> 3405.75s]  You're a degenerate.
[3409.75s -> 3415.51s]  Why is she doing this twice?
[3415.51s -> 3418.52s]  Did she get hurt? Did she fall down?
[3431.19s -> 3433.19s]  What are we implying here?
[3433.27s -> 3435.70s]  What are we implying here?
[3435.70s -> 3437.70s]  That she did a couple backflips or frontflips and landed her head?
[3437.70s -> 3442.50s]  Now I feel guilty?
[3442.50s -> 3444.50s]  Is that what that was?
[3444.50s -> 3448.60s]  Alright.
[3457.90s -> 3459.90s]  She's armed with an insecticide.
[3461.90s -> 3463.90s]  Oh great.
[3463.90s -> 3468.87s]  So now they have weapons.
[3473.18s -> 3475.18s]  The potato cakes are ruined.
[3475.18s -> 3477.42s]  I'm sorry, degenerates.
[3479.42s -> 3481.98s]  I don't mind.
[3481.98s -> 3483.98s]  Just as long as you are safe.
[3483.98s -> 3492.30s]  Kenichi.
[3492.30s -> 3494.30s]  You're bothering the neighbors. Keep it down.
[3494.30s -> 3498.65s]  Did she just say that?
[3498.65s -> 3503.26s]  Don't break that bag, Zappa.
[3503.26s -> 3505.26s]  It's new, you know?
[3505.26s -> 3509.16s]  Really?
[3509.16s -> 3511.16s]  A wolf?
[3511.16s -> 3514.04s]  She's just like her mother.
[3514.04s -> 3516.47s]  In fact, wolves just walk by the house.
[3516.55s -> 3518.55s]  Alright.
[3518.55s -> 3529.74s]  So we're in her room.
[3529.74s -> 3539.91s]  She has bug spray and a zapper.
[3539.91s -> 3542.28s]  Is she screaming that?
[3542.28s -> 3544.28s]  The cuckoo clock?
[3544.28s -> 3559.38s]  Okay, that's VR game level of involvement there.
[3576.49s -> 3578.49s]  What's with this posture?
[3580.98s -> 3583.48s]  What?
[3583.48s -> 3585.48s]  Alright, we're easy.
[3585.56s -> 3588.31s]  What?
[3588.31s -> 3590.31s]  Alright, we're easy.
[3590.31s -> 3592.31s]  You just turned this into a lot more difficult for me.
[3594.31s -> 3597.88s]  I made a lot.
[3597.88s -> 3599.88s]  Let me get the bug zapper.
[3599.88s -> 3601.88s]  And then, where am I supposed to bite?
[3603.88s -> 3608.90s]  Do you see it?
[3608.90s -> 3610.90s]  The neck maybe?
[3610.90s -> 3613.58s]  Bone?
[3613.58s -> 3615.58s]  Turn it off?
[3615.58s -> 3625.37s]  Let me turn it off.
[3625.37s -> 3628.44s]  What do we got? What am I supposed to get?
[3632.79s -> 3634.79s]  Oh, it's that.
[3634.79s -> 3636.79s]  I thought that was a toaster.
[3636.79s -> 3639.29s]  Let's see what we can do here.
[3639.29s -> 3641.53s]  The leg?
[3641.53s -> 3643.53s]  I don't see anything.
[3643.53s -> 3645.53s]  It's probably arm, neck?
[3645.53s -> 3647.53s]  Face?
[3647.53s -> 3652.01s]  Watch out.
[3655.45s -> 3658.20s]  Shoulder?
[3662.20s -> 3666.62s]  Oh, she hit me.
[3666.70s -> 3670.07s]  I don't have any idea.
[3670.07s -> 3674.49s]  Answer the phone?
[3674.49s -> 3676.49s]  Got it.
[3676.49s -> 3685.06s]  Wait, who called her?
[3685.06s -> 3690.23s]  She's pretending to answer the phone.
[3690.23s -> 3692.23s]  I just hit the button.
[3692.23s -> 3697.67s]  There's nobody on that phone.
[3697.67s -> 3703.24s]  Okay, so I called somebody else and then she's acting.
[3703.24s -> 3707.21s]  I don't understand that.
[3707.21s -> 3709.21s]  Got it.
[3709.21s -> 3727.24s]  I'm going to still be in here, right?
[3727.24s -> 3729.24s]  Even when she hangs the phone up?
[3729.24s -> 3731.24s]  Out.
[3731.32s -> 3736.25s]  Out.
[3736.25s -> 3743.40s]  Yeah, what kind of conversation was that?
[3743.40s -> 3745.40s]  Was she taking a delivery order?
[3745.40s -> 3748.47s]  I'll take a sausage and onion.
[3748.47s -> 3750.47s]  Yes, okay.
[3750.47s -> 3752.47s]  And I'll also take a side of french fries, too.
[3752.47s -> 3754.47s]  Oh, yes, okay.
[3754.47s -> 3756.97s]  And I also want an Italian sub.
[3756.97s -> 3758.97s]  Yes, okay.
[3758.97s -> 3773.45s]  Can you mash up a mosquito and grind it up and put it in the fucking smoothie for me?
[3773.45s -> 3775.45s]  I gotta get out.
[3775.45s -> 3792.47s]  There we go.
[3792.47s -> 3798.30s]  I just have to keep doing this.
[3798.38s -> 3802.47s]  Yeah, this is rockin' music.
[3802.47s -> 3818.60s]  Fuck.
[3818.60s -> 3820.60s]  I gotta go back further.
[3822.60s -> 3824.60s]  Risky. Too risky. Too risky out.
[3826.60s -> 3831.78s]  I gotta try to put it on the spot.
[3831.78s -> 3836.33s]  She keeps answering the phone.
[3836.33s -> 3838.33s]  Maybe I can just get it without...
[3838.33s -> 3840.33s]  Nah, I definitely have to do. Anything else in the room I can do?
[3840.33s -> 3842.33s]  I can turn the lights off, but that sucks.
[3842.33s -> 3844.50s]  I'll try it.
[3844.50s -> 3849.82s]  She's just entertaining herself.
[3849.82s -> 3852.89s]  You already got over here?
[3852.97s -> 3864.66s]  Oh, no.
[3864.66s -> 3866.66s]  Nah, phone is definitely the best tactic.
[3866.66s -> 3873.37s]  I just gotta go further up.
[3877.59s -> 3879.59s]  Turn it on.
[3879.59s -> 3882.54s]  No!
[3882.54s -> 3889.06s]  Just keep calling her.
[3889.06s -> 3897.77s]  At what point would you really...
[3897.77s -> 3900.20s]  What about...
[3900.20s -> 3903.59s]  Can I do something on the other side?
[3903.59s -> 3905.59s]  Right here on the shoulder.
[3905.59s -> 3907.59s]  Come on.
[3907.59s -> 3918.54s]  That wasn't the shoulder.
[3918.54s -> 3922.12s]  Goddammit.
[3924.12s -> 3926.12s]  Fuck.
[3926.12s -> 3930.09s]  This one's hard.
[3930.09s -> 3934.70s]  She's stressed, but I gotta do it.
[3934.70s -> 3937.13s]  Ow.
[3937.13s -> 3943.51s]  Alright, we're fine.
[3943.51s -> 3954.58s]  I wonder if this will work better, too.
[3954.58s -> 3960.97s]  Let me try this.
[3960.97s -> 3965.58s]  Can I do it from here, too?
[3965.58s -> 3968.58s]  Let me see.
[3968.58s -> 3971.21s]  On the shoulder?
[3971.21s -> 3975.11s]  What? No.
[3975.11s -> 3977.11s]  It's only phone?
[3977.11s -> 3980.44s]  How is phone the only thing...
[3980.44s -> 3983.00s]  It has to be the phone.
[3983.08s -> 3988.89s]  Turn off the TV?
[3988.89s -> 3992.79s]  I don't think I can.
[3992.79s -> 3995.54s]  This is the only way this is gonna work.
[3995.54s -> 4001.05s]  It's risky, but I gotta do it.
[4001.05s -> 4003.05s]  Give me one, give me one, give me one, give me one.
[4003.05s -> 4008.62s]  Out.
[4008.62s -> 4010.62s]  Whoa! I just barely missed it.
[4010.62s -> 4012.62s]  No, I'm... Oh, no.
[4012.62s -> 4014.62s]  Get out.
[4014.62s -> 4017.43s]  Quick, turn off the lights.
[4017.43s -> 4024.54s]  Okay, she can't reach this high.
[4024.54s -> 4029.08s]  Holy shit, she has the spray.
[4029.08s -> 4034.01s]  What did I just do?
[4034.01s -> 4047.96s]  Right in the chest.
[4048.04s -> 4052.07s]  Like, right in the heart.
[4052.07s -> 4054.07s]  She just counter-punched me.
[4054.07s -> 4056.07s]  Holy shit. You gotta be kidding me.
[4056.07s -> 4060.30s]  She's gonna spray me!
[4060.30s -> 4062.86s]  Did it work?
[4062.86s -> 4070.79s]  I gotta get her in the knee, I think.
[4070.79s -> 4073.99s]  One more spot, right? I think right in the knee.
[4073.99s -> 4079.61s]  Where is it? Where is it?
[4079.61s -> 4086.07s]  Where's this last spot?
[4086.07s -> 4094.38s]  Okay, behind her.
[4094.38s -> 4100.14s]  Damn it!
[4100.14s -> 4104.73s]  I got it.
[4104.73s -> 4106.73s]  Wait.
[4106.73s -> 4108.73s]  Oh, that's the phone.
[4108.81s -> 4110.81s]  Alright, saved it.
[4120.43s -> 4122.43s]  I can't do it anymore, I gotta do the shoulder.
[4123.43s -> 4125.43s]  Oh my god, no way.
[4125.43s -> 4127.43s]  I can't do the neck anymore.
[4127.43s -> 4131.91s]  I gotta do the shoulder.
[4131.91s -> 4137.86s]  But how am I gonna...
[4141.56s -> 4161.11s]  Ooh!
[4161.11s -> 4164.63s]  Whoosh!
[4164.63s -> 4167.19s]  Oh, come on! Holy shit!
[4167.19s -> 4169.19s]  Why? Jesus!
[4169.27s -> 4173.82s]  That went quick!
[4173.82s -> 4176.89s]  Oh my god.
[4176.89s -> 4179.58s]  I'm gonna die.
[4179.58s -> 4185.27s]  No, I still have hearts.
[4185.27s -> 4188.66s]  I didn't get it.
[4188.66s -> 4190.66s]  Oh no, this is bad.
[4190.66s -> 4194.63s]  Why can't I turn her on? Turn her on!
[4194.63s -> 4201.16s]  This is one.
[4203.16s -> 4206.10s]  One behind, two.
[4206.10s -> 4212.12s]  I gotta do the star fox turn around and go right.
[4214.12s -> 4218.09s]  Like this.
[4218.09s -> 4228.50s]  This is so hard.
[4228.58s -> 4230.58s]  Damn it!
[4230.58s -> 4232.58s]  No!
[4232.58s -> 4236.94s]  Snake, there are only 20 seconds left.
[4241.54s -> 4248.33s]  Come on!
[4250.33s -> 4253.40s]  I gotta wait till she takes the can out.
[4253.40s -> 4257.82s]  Okay, can's out. Now I can get the arm.
[4257.82s -> 4262.30s]  Holy shit.
[4262.30s -> 4267.78s]  Get it!
[4267.78s -> 4271.24s]  Alright, there's one more down here.
[4280.63s -> 4284.15s]  No, I didn't get that!
[4284.23s -> 4292.87s]  I'm right here!
[4292.87s -> 4296.87s]  So I can only do the top of the finger for three or four seconds.
[4313.05s -> 4316.31s]  Game. What the hell? Why?
[4316.31s -> 4323.21s]  Okay, almost.
[4328.28s -> 4330.28s]  That's it.
[4330.28s -> 4339.50s]  There's the hang up. Got it.
[4339.50s -> 4348.84s]  Do it. Hit the phone.
[4351.64s -> 4353.64s]  You should do it.
[4361.42s -> 4363.42s]  I gotta do another one?
[4363.42s -> 4365.42s]  What's the other one?
[4383.00s -> 4389.66s]  Where is it?
[4389.66s -> 4391.66s]  Is it the hand again? No, it's the hand again.
[4391.66s -> 4401.45s]  Try something besides phone.
[4401.45s -> 4403.45s]  I did the stereo.
[4403.45s -> 4405.82s]  It didn't do anything.
[4405.82s -> 4407.82s]  I couldn't bite her anywhere.
[4407.82s -> 4413.82s]  It's the hand again.
[4417.70s -> 4419.70s]  Okay, talk to you soon.
[4423.70s -> 4425.70s]  Here it comes.
[4438.68s -> 4440.68s]  Check on the pillow?
[4440.68s -> 4444.78s]  I don't see an indicator.
[4444.78s -> 4446.78s]  I'm just gonna do this.
[4446.78s -> 4451.77s]  The only indicator is the phone and the stereo.
[4456.89s -> 4458.89s]  Shit. Not good.
[4460.89s -> 4462.89s]  Yeah.
[4464.89s -> 4466.89s]  Don't risk it.
[4466.89s -> 4470.02s]  Don't risk it.
[4470.02s -> 4475.53s]  Yeah, there's nothing else in here.
[4475.53s -> 4477.53s]  I can't mess around with something on the table.
[4477.53s -> 4481.62s]  Nothing in the trash.
[4481.62s -> 4483.62s]  Stereo is the only one. I can't even press the stereo.
[4483.62s -> 4485.62s]  But she kind of kneels down for a second.
[4485.62s -> 4487.62s]  This tactic is working.
[4487.62s -> 4492.94s]  This will be it.
[4492.94s -> 4497.67s]  That's it. Close it up.
[4497.75s -> 4500.89s]  Got it.
[4500.89s -> 4502.89s]  That was 15 minutes?
[4502.89s -> 4505.19s]  Holy shit.
[4505.19s -> 4510.89s]  Yeah, but I'm dumb and blame games.
[4510.89s -> 4512.89s]  What are you talking about?
[4512.89s -> 4515.64s]  There were only two things to activate in the room.
[4515.64s -> 4532.28s]  What else could I have done besides the phone and the stereo?
[4532.28s -> 4534.28s]  The TV didn't have an indicator on it.
[4549.78s -> 4551.78s]  Don't touch anything.
[4565.78s -> 4567.78s]  Avoid everything.
[4567.78s -> 4573.42s]  Yeah, no feet.
[4573.42s -> 4577.00s]  Not this time.
[4585.00s -> 4587.00s]  Stop all hobbies that cause injuries.
[4589.00s -> 4591.00s]  Flower arranging is the spirit of Japan.
[4591.00s -> 4593.00s]  What do you think, Rena?
[4593.00s -> 4595.00s]  Would you like to try it?
[4595.00s -> 4597.69s]  No way.
[4597.69s -> 4601.69s]  Genichi, I covered the tummy mats in the Japanese room with tick insecticide.
[4603.69s -> 4605.69s]  There's no way that I'm going to be beaten.
[4605.69s -> 4607.69s]  That makes me feel a lot better.
[4611.69s -> 4613.69s]  I wonder if it's a tick though.
[4618.36s -> 4620.36s]  Why is this guy wearing glasses with no lenses?
[4622.36s -> 4632.84s]  I don't know. That's a good question.
[4632.84s -> 4634.84s]  Who names their room the Japanese room?
[4641.80s -> 4643.80s]  All right. Don't touch anything.
[4643.80s -> 4652.76s]  This is going to be difficult. How am I going to get in here?
[4652.76s -> 4657.18s]  Why is he just staring at this?
[4657.18s -> 4660.31s]  What's going on?
[4660.31s -> 4667.53s]  Is this like meditation or something?
[4667.53s -> 4669.53s]  Stay away from the floor mats and mosquito coil fumes.
[4671.53s -> 4677.16s]  Okay. So we can't do that.
[4677.16s -> 4679.98s]  So we have to stay away from the fumes.
[4680.06s -> 4682.06s]  Let's see. I can't do anything there.
[4684.06s -> 4686.94s]  He's breathing in the fumes?
[4686.94s -> 4688.94s]  Oh, shit. Okay.
[4688.94s -> 4690.94s]  I'm like trapped in here.
[4690.94s -> 4693.11s]  It's hot.
[4693.11s -> 4695.11s]  What points of interest?
[4695.11s -> 4699.14s]  On his back?
[4699.14s -> 4701.14s]  That might be his chest.
[4701.14s -> 4706.46s]  Maybe this way.
[4706.46s -> 4714.01s]  I think it might be his chest.
[4714.01s -> 4720.54s]  Then over there.
[4720.54s -> 4723.10s]  I can't touch anything there.
[4723.10s -> 4725.10s]  Maybe this way.
[4725.18s -> 4731.26s]  Does he hurt thorns?
[4731.26s -> 4734.14s]  I have to bite him in the eye?
[4734.14s -> 4736.14s]  No. What about over here?
[4736.14s -> 4741.00s]  Can I activate this?
[4741.00s -> 4748.42s]  Nothing I can activate.
[4748.42s -> 4752.01s]  There's no button to press.
[4752.01s -> 4755.02s]  What about behind me? Can I turn the light off?
[4755.02s -> 4758.28s]  I have no idea what this guy is doing.
[4758.28s -> 4760.28s]  I have to bite him in the mouth.
[4760.28s -> 4765.78s]  Do I have to bite him in the lips?
[4774.81s -> 4778.33s]  I don't understand.
[4778.33s -> 4793.62s]  There were no points to attack him.
[4793.70s -> 4799.70s]  I don't think I might have to sneak around when he's trying to put the flower in.
[4799.70s -> 4801.70s]  I'm almost dead.
[4801.70s -> 4804.97s]  I exploded.
[4804.97s -> 4810.15s]  Okay.
[4810.15s -> 4812.46s]  What happened at the end there?
[4812.46s -> 4817.58s]  I just got aquatined.
[4817.58s -> 4820.46s]  Doesn't Master Shake do that to everybody?
[4820.46s -> 4822.46s]  After Season 3?
[4834.17s -> 4849.78s]  It was his chest.
[4849.78s -> 4861.24s]  It was somewhere in his stomach.
[4861.24s -> 4865.08s]  It was either his stomach or his back.
[4865.16s -> 4867.16s]  Don't touch the floor, don't touch the fumes.
[4867.16s -> 4869.16s]  There are two points.
[4869.16s -> 4873.19s]  Maybe can I go through?
[4873.19s -> 4875.94s]  Alright.
[4875.94s -> 4877.94s]  I don't even know where the game is.
[4877.94s -> 4879.94s]  Maybe this way.
[4879.94s -> 4883.53s]  Maybe I can fly through his legs.
[4883.53s -> 4886.09s]  This might be Finesse.
[4886.09s -> 4889.16s]  He's so stressed out.
[4889.16s -> 4892.94s]  It's hot.
[4892.94s -> 4894.94s]  You again!
[4902.17s -> 4904.17s]  I thought maybe I could go through his legs.
[4904.17s -> 4915.22s]  This? What are you doing?
[4915.30s -> 4917.30s]  I was just practicing.
[4917.30s -> 4919.30s]  Rage Quit?
[4919.30s -> 4921.30s]  It's faster for me to reload.
[4921.30s -> 4928.28s]  Next game?
[4928.28s -> 4931.35s]  No.
[4931.35s -> 4938.01s]  The next game is Germa Slots.
[4938.01s -> 4941.02s]  I want to play this for a little longer.
[4941.02s -> 4943.02s]  That's what's going to happen.
[4943.02s -> 4961.70s]  I need to beat these people.
[4961.70s -> 4965.70s]  I need to at least get to a point where I'm satisfied sucking all their blood.
[4965.70s -> 4968.01s]  This game is a 15 hour game.
[4968.01s -> 4970.01s]  I'm not going to play this game for 15 hours.
[4970.09s -> 4972.09s]  It's been like an hour and 15 minutes.
[4972.09s -> 4975.74s]  Alright.
[4975.74s -> 4982.90s]  Maybe this way.
[4982.90s -> 4986.81s]  Give me an indicator.
[4986.81s -> 4989.88s]  How am I supposed to...
[4989.88s -> 4994.23s]  It feels like you can't avoid any of that stuff.
[4994.23s -> 4997.56s]  It's hot.
[4997.56s -> 5004.02s]  What is that?
[5004.02s -> 5006.26s]  When he says it's hot.
[5006.26s -> 5008.26s]  He goes it's hot.
[5008.26s -> 5011.40s]  Maybe this way.
[5011.40s -> 5014.60s]  This game is only like 3 hours.
[5014.60s -> 5016.60s]  It's not like 15 hours.
[5016.60s -> 5018.60s]  Where are you getting the 15 hours from?
[5018.68s -> 5020.68s]  There's 12 stages.
[5020.68s -> 5022.68s]  Why are people saying this is like a 10 hour game?
[5028.18s -> 5031.58s]  I'm waiting for an indicator.
[5031.58s -> 5040.84s]  Nothing?
[5040.84s -> 5046.28s]  Right in the hand.
[5046.28s -> 5049.35s]  How long does that last for though?
[5049.35s -> 5054.26s]  Maybe this way.
[5054.26s -> 5056.26s]  How much time do I have?
[5056.26s -> 5058.26s]  That's like 3 or 4 seconds.
[5058.26s -> 5067.14s]  Indicator's gone in his hand now.
[5067.14s -> 5071.18s]  Maybe this way.
[5071.18s -> 5073.61s]  He's starting to see me.
[5073.61s -> 5078.66s]  He pricks his finger on the rose but how come I didn't see it last time?
[5078.74s -> 5080.74s]  I'm just sitting there waiting for it.
[5080.74s -> 5083.05s]  It's hot.
[5083.05s -> 5086.25s]  I can do his face too.
[5086.25s -> 5094.44s]  Maybe this way.
[5094.44s -> 5101.93s]  Alright, here it is.
[5101.93s -> 5103.93s]  My finger.
[5103.93s -> 5105.93s]  And no indicator.
[5105.93s -> 5108.94s]  That's only on for 2 seconds.
[5108.94s -> 5112.78s]  Maybe this way.
[5112.78s -> 5125.58s]  It's hot.
[5125.58s -> 5129.22s]  I'm frightened of his lips.
[5131.22s -> 5133.22s]  I should not be able to do it like this.
[5133.30s -> 5135.30s]  That's happened to me before though.
[5135.30s -> 5139.88s]  How often is a mosquito flown into your mouth?
[5139.88s -> 5142.25s]  Then you go like
[5142.25s -> 5144.25s]  It happens at least once or twice.
[5144.25s -> 5146.25s]  A season.
[5146.25s -> 5148.25s]  It does.
[5148.25s -> 5150.25s]  Let me get it all in one go.
[5150.33s -> 5152.33s]  Let's see if we can do it.
[5152.33s -> 5154.33s]  There goes another one.
[5154.33s -> 5156.33s]  I don't know why it's gone.
[5156.33s -> 5158.33s]  It's very hot.
[5158.33s -> 5160.33s]  Here it is.
[5160.33s -> 5162.33s]  I'm going to turn on the indicator.
[5162.33s -> 5164.33s]  If I can actually do this.
[5164.33s -> 5166.33s]  I'm going to do an indicator.
[5166.33s -> 5168.33s]  If I can actually do this.
[5168.33s -> 5170.33s]  See that?
[5170.33s -> 5172.33s]  What aE HP.
[5172.33s -> 5174.33s]  Come on!
[5174.33s -> 5176.33s]  Wait.
[5176.33s -> 5178.33s]  Oh no, I'm going to do the indicator.
[5178.33s -> 5204.32s]  Come on, right in his... right there, right there.
[5204.32s -> 5205.32s]  I didn't hit that.
[5205.32s -> 5209.31s]  What is going on with this camera?
[5209.31s -> 5210.31s]  One more.
[5210.31s -> 5213.41s]  Was it on his back?
[5213.41s -> 5214.41s]  Probably.
[5214.41s -> 5217.18s]  It's probably like on his ass or something.
[5217.18s -> 5218.18s]  Alright, I gotta be careful.
[5218.18s -> 5233.57s]  I just need to do this like one more time.
[5233.57s -> 5241.67s]  Right in his mouth.
[5241.67s -> 5242.67s]  Right in his mouth, same deal.
[5242.67s -> 5244.17s]  Right in his lip.
[5244.17s -> 5269.13s]  And we need one more.
[5269.13s -> 5270.13s]  That's it for that one.
[5270.13s -> 5271.13s]  I need the other one now.
[5271.13s -> 5272.56s]  What?
[5272.56s -> 5273.56s]  Oh, come on.
[5273.56s -> 5274.56s]  Didn't get it.
[5274.56s -> 5275.56s]  Come on, it's right there.
[5275.56s -> 5280.38s]  No!
[5284.87s -> 5291.87s]  I'm gonna die from these fumes.
[5291.87s -> 5298.96s]  I'm dead.
[5298.96s -> 5301.14s]  I'm dead.
[5301.14s -> 5309.48s]  Oh, god damn it.
[5309.48s -> 5310.48s]  This level sucks.
[5310.48s -> 5314.77s]  No, not next!
[5314.77s -> 5317.49s]  No, I gotta beat this guy!
[5317.49s -> 5337.79s]  I have to beat this guy.
[5337.79s -> 5339.03s]  The only thing is, where's the other...
[5339.03s -> 5341.37s]  It's gotta be the hand, right?
[5341.37s -> 5345.38s]  So it's his hand and his mouth.
[5345.38s -> 5346.60s]  Sunk cost fallacy.
[5346.60s -> 5364.69s]  wait to talk about some cost balancing before we get into a turn of flux burning seven mosquito
[5364.69s -> 5378.39s]  coils at the same time is roughly equivalent to burning 700 cigarettes that's insane okay now the
