[0.31s -> 14.08s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Hitman Absolution!
[14.08s -> 20.08s]  This game came out literally last night, and I am giddy as a horse on a track.
[20.08s -> 24.08s]  I don't even know what the context of that actually means, but I cannot wait to play this game.
[24.08s -> 27.08s]  I've been waiting for this game for so long, and it's finally here.
[27.08s -> 30.08s]  So, what do you say we start this? Let's play, baby.
[30.08s -> 36.08s]  Doing it right from scratch. I've never played one second of this game, so this is completely blind, and let's go.
[36.08s -> 57.26s]  Listen to me. I need you to be...
[57.26s -> 63.38s]  Alright, so, I think I have completed the tutorial so far.
[63.38s -> 67.38s]  The lady was just like talking in my ear, so I was like, you know what? We're like gonna just skip right through this.
[67.38s -> 72.38s]  So, what I've learned so far is how to essentially play the game, and that's good!
[72.38s -> 75.38s]  So, I'm gonna try... Oh, he's talking.
[75.38s -> 78.55s]  Accessing mansion. Approaching target.
[78.55s -> 82.37s]  Alright. So, ask climb down.
[82.37s -> 86.25s]  I'm doing some... What'd you... I thought I fell.
[86.25s -> 94.68s]  Oh, boy.
[94.68s -> 96.68s]  Move on. I gotta see if anyone's in here.
[96.68s -> 100.62s]  Nope. Move past window. Go!
[100.62s -> 102.62s]  Move past window again. Go!
[102.62s -> 105.80s]  This is some James Bond crap here.
[105.80s -> 108.10s]  Jump up there, baby.
[108.10s -> 111.10s]  But, yes, I have to kill my old contractor.
[111.10s -> 113.73s]  So, let's see. Oh, boy.
[113.73s -> 117.73s]  This place is heavily guarded.
[117.73s -> 122.98s]  Uh, can I, like, shoot this guy in his face?
[122.98s -> 127.98s]  Oh, nope. I'm good. I'm good.
[127.98s -> 132.18s]  Yeah, get out of my... I'm trying to sneak around here.
[132.18s -> 145.25s]  Yeah, get out of my face. Get out of the window, man.
[145.25s -> 148.49s]  Why did I do that?
[148.49s -> 152.56s]  That means I gotta kill this guy now.
[152.56s -> 155.56s]  Damn it. Alright, we did it.
[161.57s -> 166.57s]  Yeah, I'll change it.
[166.57s -> 171.57s]  I gotta put my weapon away.
[171.57s -> 173.57s]  I gotta drag this guy out of the way.
[173.57s -> 177.45s]  Come here. I'm gonna hide you behind here.
[177.45s -> 181.01s]  That was kind of unnecessary, but, you know, whatever.
[181.01s -> 182.01s]  Can I throw him out the window?
[182.01s -> 185.01s]  Oh, I think I can dump this guy out the freaking window.
[185.01s -> 192.60s]  Oh, man. See you later, buddy.
[192.60s -> 195.60s]  Oh, no. Oh, I gotta do it to this guy, too.
[195.60s -> 196.60s]  Wait, any guards?
[196.60s -> 200.22s]  Oh, yeah, holding down control lets you do something called instinct,
[200.22s -> 203.22s]  which lets you blend in and see kind of through walls.
[203.22s -> 204.22s]  So, let's dump this guy now, too.
[204.22s -> 206.22s]  Hey, your friends out there, you wanna go see them?
[206.22s -> 211.64s]  No, I don't wanna do this. No, please.
[211.64s -> 215.90s]  Alright, let's be careful here. No, I don't see anybody.
[215.90s -> 219.42s]  Here's the exit right here. Open.
[219.42s -> 227.09s]  Okay, can I open the fridge?
[227.09s -> 230.58s]  Disable security system. Where is it?
[230.58s -> 232.58s]  Okay, security system's over there.
[232.58s -> 234.58s]  Gotta disable it so I can kill my target,
[234.58s -> 237.58s]  Diana Stevenson, whatever her name is.
[237.58s -> 241.51s]  Evidence.
[246.51s -> 249.51s]  Perfect. Yeah, my meter on the bottom right,
[249.51s -> 250.51s]  if you don't know what it is,
[250.51s -> 254.51s]  instinct, that depletes the more I hold down control.
[254.51s -> 257.46s]  So, wait, what is this, disguise? Is this a new disguise?
[257.46s -> 260.89s]  Can I put this on? Oh, I already have that one on.
[260.89s -> 262.89s]  If you don't know what hitman disguising is,
[262.89s -> 264.89s]  when you kill people or you knock them out,
[264.89s -> 268.89s]  you can take their clothing and blend in with places that you belong.
[268.89s -> 271.13s]  So, it's very, very interesting.
[271.13s -> 274.13s]  Beyond this door, the rating system will be turned on.
[274.13s -> 277.13s]  It will monitor your play style and reward your progress.
[277.13s -> 278.13s]  Ooh, okay.
[278.13s -> 280.13s]  You can see it in the top left corner.
[280.13s -> 284.13s]  As always, how you handle your assignment is entirely up to you.
[284.13s -> 288.62s]  Mmm, good luck. Alright, here we go.
[288.62s -> 291.57s]  Get key card from head of security.
[291.57s -> 293.94s]  Look at all those guys.
[293.94s -> 297.01s]  Whoa, that guy's right there.
[297.01s -> 300.72s]  That guy's path is up there.
[309.72s -> 311.72s]  Alright, what is this pot?
[311.72s -> 313.72s]  Do I, like, have to...
[316.72s -> 318.72s]  I don't know, I'm scared.
[321.72s -> 324.72s]  Let's go, man. Get out of this room. I want to poison you.
[324.72s -> 325.72s]  Ooh.
[327.72s -> 329.72s]  Oh, God, he's coming over here.
[338.79s -> 340.79s]  Alright, I'm killing this guy.
[340.79s -> 342.79s]  Get out of here!
[342.79s -> 345.74s]  Alright, alright.
[345.74s -> 347.74s]  I was only asking. Christ.
[347.74s -> 349.74s]  Don't have a heart attack.
[349.74s -> 354.87s]  I say, go guard a gate or shoot at some beer can.
[354.87s -> 357.87s]  The heat should dissolve any hint of foreign substance.
[357.87s -> 360.87s]  So, wait, I gotta poison this stuff?
[360.87s -> 362.87s]  Oh, his knife just disappeared. Oh, boy.
[362.87s -> 364.87s]  Oh, boy, playing ring around the rosie with the chef.
[364.87s -> 367.87s]  Oh, boy. Ring around the rosie. Oh, boy.
[367.87s -> 370.11s]  Oh, no.
[370.11s -> 372.11s]  I killed the chef.
[372.11s -> 375.11s]  Get over here. Get over here. Come here.
[375.11s -> 377.93s]  Come here, you fat bastard.
[377.93s -> 379.93s]  I'm gonna put you in the freezer.
[379.93s -> 384.22s]  Oh, I'm gonna take his clothes.
[384.22s -> 386.22s]  I'm gonna be like Chef 47. Here we go.
[386.22s -> 388.22s]  Is it gonna look so stupid?
[392.22s -> 394.22s]  Oh, nice.
[400.22s -> 402.22s]  Oh.
[405.22s -> 407.22s]  Alright, let's see.
[407.22s -> 409.22s]  What about my world famous fish dish?
[409.22s -> 411.58s]  I'm good.
[411.58s -> 413.58s]  Except for the big pool of blood over here.
[413.58s -> 415.58s]  I think I'm doing alright right now.
[415.58s -> 417.58s]  Anything else I can grab over here?
[417.58s -> 420.40s]  No, I don't have any visible guns.
[420.40s -> 422.40s]  Let's go through here.
[422.40s -> 424.40s]  Looking for the head of security is over there.
[424.40s -> 426.40s]  There he is.
[426.40s -> 429.47s]  Gotta get his key card.
[429.47s -> 431.47s]  I'm disguised as the chef.
[431.47s -> 434.61s]  Wait.
[434.61s -> 436.61s]  Choice coffee.
[436.61s -> 438.61s]  Do I gotta poison the coffee?
[444.61s -> 446.61s]  Fire poker.
[448.61s -> 450.61s]  Oh, I wanna pick up this fire poker.
[456.61s -> 458.61s]  Oh, what's upstairs?
[458.61s -> 460.61s]  Let's go upstairs.
[460.61s -> 463.36s]  Let's go upstairs.
[463.36s -> 465.36s]  I gotta find poison or something.
[465.36s -> 467.36s]  Trespassing? What?
[467.36s -> 469.36s]  Oh, damn.
[469.36s -> 471.36s]  Oh, hi. Hello there, sir.
[471.36s -> 473.36s]  Yes, I know. I'm going back downstairs.
[473.36s -> 475.36s]  Don't worry. I'm just gonna
[475.36s -> 477.36s]  go downstairs for a second here.
[481.01s -> 483.01s]  Don't worry about the MasterChef.
[485.82s -> 487.82s]  Oh, don't you worry about a thing.
[487.82s -> 489.82s]  Shh. Quiet. Quiet.
[489.82s -> 491.82s]  Yes. Yes.
[491.82s -> 494.06s]  Now come with me.
[494.06s -> 496.69s]  I'll take this disguise from you.
[496.69s -> 499.44s]  And then I'm gonna dump your ass
[499.44s -> 503.79s]  into here.
[503.79s -> 506.67s]  Okay. I need to find a solution.
[506.67s -> 508.67s]  I could just go guns blazing, but I don't
[508.67s -> 510.67s]  wanna really do that. I do that way too often
[510.67s -> 512.67s]  in games. Sleeping pills.
[512.67s -> 515.49s]  Ooh. Ooh, sleeping pills.
[515.49s -> 518.30s]  Bang. You know it.
[518.30s -> 520.30s]  Activate checkpoint. Hell yeah.
[524.30s -> 526.30s]  Can I take a dump?
[526.30s -> 528.30s]  No. Alright, so I got these
[528.30s -> 530.30s]  sleeping pills. I'm gonna put the sleeping pills in the drink.
[530.30s -> 532.30s]  The guy's gonna fall asleep, and I'm gonna take his money,
[532.30s -> 534.30s]  his wallet, and the keycard.
[534.30s -> 536.30s]  Statue bust.
[536.30s -> 538.30s]  Take the statue.
[538.30s -> 542.21s]  I don't wanna use this right now.
[542.21s -> 544.21s]  In fact, I gotta let go of this.
[546.21s -> 548.21s]  Let's head back downstairs.
[548.21s -> 550.21s]  This door requires a keycard.
[550.21s -> 552.21s]  What? Oh, no.
[552.21s -> 554.21s]  Did that guy have one on him?
[554.21s -> 556.21s]  Oh, damn it.
[556.21s -> 558.21s]  That asshole down over here has
[558.21s -> 561.02s]  a keycard, I think.
[561.02s -> 563.02s]  Hey, where did I dump your body?
[563.02s -> 565.02s]  Oh, in here. Excuse me, sir, do you have a card?
[565.02s -> 567.02s]  No, I don't wanna get in with this guy.
[567.02s -> 569.26s]  This is weird.
[569.26s -> 571.26s]  No, I don't wanna do that.
[571.26s -> 573.26s]  Oh, crap.
[573.26s -> 575.26s]  How am I gonna get to? Oh, no, no, no.
[575.26s -> 577.26s]  I can go downstairs. I actually came from down here.
[577.26s -> 579.26s]  What am I doing here?
[579.26s -> 581.26s]  I gotta let go of this stupid statue.
[581.26s -> 585.54s]  Alright, good.
[585.54s -> 587.71s]  I wanna holster that.
[587.71s -> 589.71s]  Good, good, good, good, good.
[589.71s -> 591.71s]  Alright, where's your coffee?
[591.71s -> 593.71s]  Oh, jeez, I'm bumping into stuff.
[593.71s -> 597.36s]  Hey, how's your coffee, sir?
[597.36s -> 599.36s]  Let me just, uh, can I talk to you
[599.36s -> 601.36s]  about, um, maybe a raise?
[601.36s -> 603.54s]  Maybe some type of situation
[603.54s -> 605.54s]  where you and I can discuss my money?
[605.54s -> 607.54s]  Maybe that would be a good thing.
[607.54s -> 609.54s]  Turn around, turn around, turn around.
[609.54s -> 612.03s]  Oh, turn around. Don't worry.
[612.03s -> 614.72s]  Don't worry about a thing. Don't worry about a thing.
[614.72s -> 616.72s]  Come drink your coffee. Hey.
[619.79s -> 621.79s]  Don't drink your damn coffee.
[626.27s -> 628.27s]  Get his uniform and weapon and send the son of a bitch packing.
[628.27s -> 630.27s]  What?
[630.27s -> 632.27s]  I will make sure he spends the rest of his career as a night watchman
[632.27s -> 634.27s]  at a midwestern corn silo.
[636.27s -> 638.27s]  I'm gonna just smash this guy, I think.
[638.27s -> 640.27s]  Let's see.
[640.27s -> 642.27s]  Is he gonna drink his coffee again? Please go back to your coffee.
[642.27s -> 644.88s]  There he goes.
[644.88s -> 646.88s]  That's right. Go drink the coffee.
[646.88s -> 648.88s]  Coffee is good.
[648.88s -> 651.95s]  Oh, you don't even know?
[651.95s -> 653.95s]  I'm just like, no, nothing. Just, uh, itching my nose here.
[653.95s -> 656.70s]  Don't worry about anything.
[656.70s -> 658.70s]  How's that coffee?
[658.70s -> 663.76s]  I bet you it's good.
[666.50s -> 668.50s]  Where are you going?
[668.50s -> 670.50s]  Stay sharp, men.
[670.50s -> 672.50s]  I have urgent business with gate security.
[672.50s -> 675.89s]  Is he gonna go, like, diarrhea? I hope so.
[675.89s -> 677.89s]  Yeah.
[677.89s -> 679.89s]  I'm gonna make sure he gets out okay, fellas.
[679.89s -> 681.89s]  Don't mind me. I'm just gonna follow him over here.
[681.89s -> 684.58s]  Oh, wait.
[684.58s -> 686.58s]  Just did.
[686.58s -> 688.58s]  How are you guys doing?
[688.58s -> 690.75s]  Hello there, men. How are you?
[690.75s -> 692.75s]  I'm a fellow recruit. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay.
[692.75s -> 696.27s]  Oh, boy. That guy is...
[696.27s -> 698.27s]  That guy's not liking this at all.
[698.27s -> 701.79s]  Oh, I'm out of instinct. I can't, like, fool him.
[701.79s -> 704.22s]  Let me just read a book.
[704.22s -> 708.96s]  Oh, nice. It worked.
[708.96s -> 711.76s]  All right. Give me your stuff.
[711.76s -> 714.00s]  Give me the key card. Give me your pistol.
[714.00s -> 717.52s]  All right.
[717.52s -> 720.53s]  All right. Good, good, good. I got the key card.
[720.53s -> 722.70s]  All right. We're doing good here.
[722.70s -> 728.45s]  Why did I do that?
[728.45s -> 730.45s]  That was completely unnecessary.
[730.45s -> 733.01s]  I just, like, lost points because of that.
[733.01s -> 735.01s]  God damn it. Why am I such a freak?
[735.01s -> 737.76s]  I could've, like...
[737.76s -> 739.76s]  Oh, well. Let's just go.
[739.76s -> 742.43s]  Why do I have to kill that guy?
[746.43s -> 748.43s]  What the... Oh!
[748.43s -> 750.74s]  Now you tell me that.
[750.74s -> 752.74s]  Oh, by the way, if you do really well and don't kill everybody,
[752.74s -> 754.74s]  you get more moves.
[754.74s -> 757.23s]  Thanks for letting me know.
[757.23s -> 759.23s]  I could've used that advice, like, 30 seconds ago
[759.23s -> 761.23s]  before I shot that guy in his face.
[761.23s -> 765.78s]  Entrance located.
[765.78s -> 770.99s]  All right. Now what?
[770.99s -> 774.69s]  Closing in on target.
[774.69s -> 778.46s]  Done 47. Diana brought this on herself.
[778.46s -> 780.46s]  Oh, she's right there.
[780.46s -> 782.46s]  She betrayed us, the agency, the code,
[782.46s -> 784.46s]  everything we stand for.
[784.46s -> 786.46s]  She is too dangerous to be left alive.
[786.46s -> 788.46s]  Think about that.
[788.46s -> 790.77s]  When you pull the trigger.
[790.77s -> 792.77s]  So, do I gotta... Oh, I'm gonna see some
[792.77s -> 794.77s]  inner conflict here, guys. Do I kill her
[794.77s -> 797.33s]  or do I not kill her?
[797.33s -> 800.53s]  She's right through this door. Should I just open the door?
[800.53s -> 802.96s]  I guess so.
[802.96s -> 804.96s]  Oh, boy!
[804.96s -> 808.35s]  Censored!
[808.35s -> 810.35s]  This is where we censor
[810.35s -> 814.51s]  a bunch of stuff.
[814.51s -> 817.39s]  Hello, Diana. Glad to see you're
[817.39s -> 819.76s]  taking a shower.
[819.76s -> 827.12s]  Fully closed, by the way.
[827.12s -> 831.60s]  Oh, and he does it.
[831.60s -> 840.86s]  Killed her.
[840.86s -> 843.42s]  Wait a minute. Get to Victoria.
[843.42s -> 846.88s]  What is going on here?
[846.88s -> 848.88s]  Oh, does it?
[848.88s -> 852.14s]  That's good to know.
[852.14s -> 854.14s]  Why do I... My guns are just out.
[854.14s -> 856.14s]  Dude, sun's out, guns out, huh?
[856.14s -> 859.41s]  Okay, let's go.
[859.41s -> 861.41s]  I think I'm gonna have to go in like a blaze
[861.41s -> 863.41s]  of glory here, guys.
[863.41s -> 865.41s]  I don't think they want me to be stealthy here.
[865.41s -> 867.41s]  Can he?
[873.41s -> 876.42s]  Really?
[876.42s -> 880.45s]  Hold control for instinct.
[880.45s -> 883.07s]  Press Q to activate point shooting.
[883.07s -> 885.07s]  Wait, what?
[885.07s -> 887.07s]  Place a tag?
[887.07s -> 889.07s]  Oh, dear
[889.07s -> 891.07s]  goodness.
[891.07s -> 893.07s]  Oh!
[893.07s -> 895.07s]  This is some Fallout 3
[895.07s -> 897.07s]  garbage right here.
[897.07s -> 899.50s]  Dude, that was...
[899.50s -> 901.50s]  That was sick!
[901.50s -> 904.51s]  I should have just done that to the whole
[904.51s -> 907.14s]  room down here.
[907.14s -> 909.14s]  Oh, wow, that was cool.
[909.14s -> 911.63s]  That was really cool.
[911.63s -> 913.63s]  I just killed four dudes in one shot.
[913.63s -> 917.15s]  That was really cool. I just killed four dudes in one second.
[917.15s -> 919.84s]  Hell freaking yeah.
[919.84s -> 923.36s]  Oh, so this is like
[923.36s -> 925.36s]  the daughter or something? I have no idea.
[925.36s -> 929.14s]  Don't worry, you can come with me.
[929.14s -> 931.31s]  I will protect you. I'm 47.
[931.31s -> 933.31s]  Good to meet you.
[933.31s -> 935.74s]  Sonny in here.
[935.74s -> 941.31s]  His mouth just moved and he didn't talk.
[941.31s -> 945.54s]  What was that?
[945.54s -> 949.76s]  She's dead.
[949.76s -> 951.76s]  Gonna bring you to somewhere safe.
[951.76s -> 955.52s]  Bitch.
[955.52s -> 957.76s]  Alright.
[957.76s -> 959.76s]  Reduce recoil when firing weapons.
[959.76s -> 964.42s]  Not too bad.
[964.42s -> 966.66s]  I mean, I got spotted once.
[966.66s -> 969.34s]  I killed a civilian apparently.
[969.34s -> 971.34s]  I killed three dudes.
[971.34s -> 973.34s]  Well, it made me kill three guys, didn't it?
[973.34s -> 976.03s]  Complete objective. Body hidden.
[976.03s -> 978.21s]  Evidence removed. Silent kill.
[978.21s -> 980.83s]  Head shot. I did okay.
[980.83s -> 982.83s]  I mean, not fantastic, but
[982.83s -> 985.71s]  for a blind run.
[985.71s -> 988.08s]  Cool, cool, cool. Alright, well
[988.08s -> 990.08s]  I guess that concludes episode one
[990.08s -> 992.38s]  of this quasi
[992.38s -> 994.38s]  playthrough of Hitman Absolution.
[994.38s -> 996.38s]  Stay tuned for episode two when
[996.38s -> 998.38s]  me and this weird girl go
[998.38s -> 1000.38s]  solve crimes together. I don't even know.
[1000.38s -> 1002.38s]  But I'll see you guys all soon. Stay tuned for next episode
[1002.38s -> 1004.38s]  and take care, everybody.
