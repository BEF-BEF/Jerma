[1.08s -> 15.43s]  Hey guys, what's up? How are you? We're here currently live, technically live.
[17.67s -> 26.06s]  I cannot guarantee that we're gonna be live for very long. We've had cocks at the house for the
[26.06s -> 37.16s]  last like six straight days and they may have figured out one of the issues. So it's just like
[37.16s -> 43.48s]  the first Red Dead stream, that's right. We'll see how long we can go. This is gonna be one of
[43.48s -> 50.38s]  those mystery boxes that you open. The stream might be two hours. It might be 10 minutes.
[50.38s -> 57.19s]  It might be six hours. I don't know. I can't some mystery. Just literally RNG the stream.
[57.19s -> 64.44s]  I know it already already already dead. No, no, we're okay. Are we? No. Hey, I'm here.
[65.16s -> 72.20s]  We just almost dropped though. That's probably gonna happen like every 15 minutes.
[72.20s -> 83.24s]  That's one minute. Oh shit. All right, when I press the button, it's probably, it's probably
[83.24s -> 93.19s]  gonna do that. So let's ride it out here for as long as we can. We'll do my, do my best to.
[94.47s -> 108.90s]  Oh, this is getting ugly. And before he moves back. No, there's no going back.
[115.18s -> 126.25s]  Damn, it was just green for so long too. It was just so solid green and now it just doesn't wanna,
[126.25s -> 133.70s]  it just doesn't wanna do it. Let's just, what's with the music? You might be hearing the PS4
[133.70s -> 145.77s]  sound effects. Let's see. It's there. Moved on from Comcast and got worse internet.
[146.97s -> 155.24s]  I have no idea. It's almost like a bad joke at this point because this is a gigabit line.
[156.92s -> 162.36s]  This is a, this is a thousand megabits per second down. This is what we get for down.
[163.75s -> 170.39s]  And they're, they just have some major, major issues that are apparently,
[171.83s -> 181.99s]  take a lot of work to solve. So this is happening way more frequently than it just was.
[183.03s -> 196.20s]  Nice, already buffering, getting a buffering pop up already. Yeah. Well, we're, well, let,
[196.20s -> 204.62s]  let just, just hang out with me for a minute. We'll sit here for a moment because we do get
[204.62s -> 211.91s]  these spots of like a few hours where it's perfectly fine. I'm getting back in a balloon.
[211.91s -> 216.97s]  I'm going back to Boston. Let's see. What do I take this screen off? What if I do this?
[218.81s -> 229.64s]  Like you can see that, right? Cause that's, that's red dead right there. Come on. Just like,
[229.64s -> 239.29s]  just like feed me through to the line that I need to be on. So I cannot guarantee the authenticity
[239.29s -> 248.66s]  of this current stream. And I'm, I'm so afraid to press the story button. I'm going to press
[248.66s -> 255.85s]  X and it's going to crash the fucking node. What a social club. I think it's the rock star thing
[255.85s -> 269.80s]  when you get online, right? Press X. Should I? I'm so scared. I'm so scared that it's not going to
[269.80s -> 281.35s]  work. Oh shit. Here goes the node. I'm doing it. I don't care. I will fight through the frame drops
[281.35s -> 290.02s]  here. Cause you guys wouldn't even believe this is nothing. We would lose internet for 12 straight
[290.02s -> 299.64s]  hours. It would just be zero. All right. I'm going. Um, here we go. Wish me luck. Ready? One,
[301.26s -> 324.44s]  two. I did it. Okay. Okay. I'll turn it up a little bit. So this is, so this is red dead
[324.44s -> 328.12s]  redemption too, by the way, you weren't aware. This is a new Western game that came out.
[328.76s -> 342.39s]  I mean, is this supposed to be somebody talking here? Spoilers. Well, what are you doing at a red
[342.39s -> 354.81s]  dead two stream? If you're scared about spoilers. I lived in Vinnie's dryer for a week.
[356.25s -> 374.17s]  No, that's not out of the ordinary though. I pay rent and the age of outlaws and gunslingers was
[374.17s -> 381.58s]  at an end. I have to turn this up. It was like a volume control on this dumb thing.
[382.38s -> 398.78s]  There we go. Turn it up. It's got to do a cowboy accent. I've even the wish had mostly been tamed.
[399.74s -> 412.98s]  That was until they showed up. Bill Bob, Barry, Borg, a few gangs still remain, but they were
[412.98s -> 418.97s]  being hunted down and destroyed. I can't read cursive. I got taught cursive. I don't know how
[418.97s -> 427.80s]  to read it. There we go. That was a cursive. I would have been upset about that. Rockstar games
[427.80s -> 450.14s]  presents red dead two. Why does it look like horror movie text? Here we go. I'm so excited for this.
[451.72s -> 455.85s]  Give me my internet. I deserve. I deserve an internet.
[469.69s -> 473.93s]  That's a lot of bird shit. All right, stop. I want to make a joke about a million birds
[473.93s -> 479.43s]  shitting all over them, but I can't stop it. Don't stop soon. We'll all be dying.
[480.57s -> 485.29s]  Whether it's May, I'm just hoping the law got as lost as we did.
[486.17s -> 492.02s]  It's me, right?
[513.19s -> 529.45s]  10 FPS with gameplay. You might be referring to my internet. Chapter one.
[531.85s -> 537.08s]  Byron. I don't know what that says. I'm not gonna read the subtitles at the bottom. I'm gonna try
[537.08s -> 554.84s]  to read it. This game is like an hour long tutorial. Hey, just long enough to us to make
[554.84s -> 569.56s]  sure the internet will stay on. Hey, welcome to the stream. Oh my god. Ms. Gaskell, get that
[569.56s -> 588.33s]  fire. Thank you. Nothing more you could have done. What are we gonna do? We need supplies.
[589.37s -> 593.21s]  Well, first of all, you're gonna stay here and you were gonna get yourself worn.
[593.85s -> 601.21s]  And I sent John and Mike scouting out ahead. Thank you so much. See if we can find
[601.37s -> 604.09s]  wait for some time to deliver these bits to you. It's great to see you back in action,
[604.09s -> 607.85s]  especially after you had to once again deal with some internet issues still are.
[609.21s -> 617.85s]  Listen, still are at the moment. Listen to me for a moment. Now we've had a bad couple of days.
[621.64s -> 633.58s]  I loved Davy, Jenny, Sean, Mac. What's his last name? John barf bag. We don't know. Something like
[633.58s -> 643.64s]  that. But we lost some folks. Now, if I could throw myself in the ground, in their stead,
[645.19s -> 653.16s]  I'd do it gladly. Quit Comcast? I don't have Comcast. I have a different ISP across the country.
[653.96s -> 662.94s]  And it still follows me. Everybody. We're safe. Now, there ain't nobody following us
[662.94s -> 669.42s]  to a storm like this one. By the time they get here. Well, we're gonna be we're gonna be long
[669.42s -> 675.75s]  gone. We've been through worse than this. John McFar's stun. That was the guy. Mr. Pearson,
[676.63s -> 682.87s]  Miss Grimshaw, I need you to turn this place into a camp. You may be here for a few days.
[683.75s -> 694.18s]  Now all of you, all of you get yourselves worn. Stay strong. It might be the modem router. Oh,
[694.18s -> 700.98s]  no, no, no. Single option is big. So they both must have headed down the hill.
[711.14s -> 718.74s]  Oh, are we like dead dead now? Oh, boy. What really went down back there on that boat?
[719.70s -> 729.35s]  We missed you. That's what happened. Come on. Hey, you need horses? Oh, yeah. Hey, Mr. Smith,
[729.91s -> 735.51s]  get yourself indoors. I know I can see it over here. Get indoors, son.
[737.35s -> 742.23s]  All right, I get to play the game, though. Need you strong. Okay, it's deep snow.
[745.27s -> 756.15s]  Ain't sure what we're gonna find out here, duds. We have to try. Stay close. We'll do our best to
[756.15s -> 761.99s]  stick to the trail. This goddamn weather. It's been two days or more like this now.
[761.99s -> 771.42s]  Yeah, I didn't think it was. There's Jabba Dab's $250 coming in. Again, thank you so much, man. I
[771.42s -> 777.59s]  know I'm like trying to bounce and monitor my connection and play a game and thank you so
[777.59s -> 789.02s]  fucking much, dude. It's a huge amount of money. It's coming up. Take it easy. Big delayed money.
[789.98s -> 799.99s]  Yeah, I don't know why that's happening. I don't know what it is with Rockstar and not putting
[799.99s -> 806.55s]  their flagship video games on PC. The first Red Dead's not even on. Red Dead Redemption's not on
[809.35s -> 811.83s]  PC at all. For some strange reason.
[820.47s -> 822.63s]  They're going northeast at the moment. Sick.
[830.55s -> 836.39s]  I'm sorry. All I heard was crouch in the corner and throw rocks at people. Is that what you wanted
[836.39s -> 846.63s]  me to do with my like Dalmatian horse? Oh, that's snow, right? I thought it was like a giant
[846.63s -> 858.46s]  Dalmatian. Is that someone coming towards us? Someone coming towards us. Are they friendly?
[859.18s -> 870.41s]  Ooh, cutscene. Bring it on. Guy on the left's gonna get picked off with an arrow.
[872.34s -> 881.30s]  Micah. Gentlemen. The audio's delayed. I think so. Found a little homestead down that
[881.30s -> 890.15s]  away. Okay. Anyone home? Sure. Place is blazing with light and noise. Sounded like a party. Let's go
[890.15s -> 897.27s]  see. Follow me. Is anyone is? How's Davey doing? Yeah, this is uh. Nor did little Jenny. Six B's.
[897.27s -> 902.87s]  Bob's Barry. Bunsen. Bugle.
[924.31s -> 928.87s]  John? He's talking about our John? My John? First game John?
[947.96s -> 960.20s]  How is it to hold? It just disappeared. Talk to Mike. Are you sure about this? Let's do that.
[962.20s -> 967.56s]  Mr. Morgan. I never thought I would be so pleased to see your face.
[967.56s -> 972.60s]  Things always turn out fine. Except for in Red Dead Redemption. Where's everyone else?
[973.16s -> 980.92s]  Old mining camp back up the hill. Hung for daddy to put food on the table. Gotta love these graphics
[980.92s -> 994.20s]  though. Snow actually permeates. I keep saying people tell me to keep looking at the balls.
[996.52s -> 1000.20s]  No. I wouldn't do that in real life. Why would I do it in a video game?
[1002.28s -> 1007.72s]  If I was in this time period I wouldn't like go underneath the carriage like it was an oil change.
[1007.88s -> 1010.52s]  Like lift up the tail and look at the ball sack. What are you talking about?
[1010.52s -> 1016.01s]  You know me. I'm a good boy. You look under your car and look for your car's balls?
[1017.13s -> 1019.93s]  What would be the car balls? I'm trying to think what it would be.
[1023.38s -> 1028.02s]  The cars? The car balls would be like the muffler right? Okay. Let's keep it down now
[1028.02s -> 1053.06s]  gentlemen. It's just up ahead. Exhaust. Turn it down. Let's head down there. I can't fall off this
[1053.06s -> 1059.61s]  can I? Health is displayed in the lower left corner. That tiny little thing is health.
[1063.05s -> 1068.97s]  That's so small. How am I supposed to see that? Wait is this like Super Mario where there's like
[1068.97s -> 1080.04s]  three quadrants? Let's hitch up here. The outer bar shows you. All right but that was like about
[1080.04s -> 1089.78s]  an outer bar and an inner bar. Approach the hitching post. Let's get it on here. Triangle
[1089.78s -> 1100.22s]  hitches the horse. Now we got our first set of action here I think. Follow Dutch. I remember
[1100.22s -> 1131.58s]  Dutch. This is a lot of snow. Why does this have to follow me everywhere I go? I don't understand.
[1134.14s -> 1137.58s]  Go to the shed and press R1 to take cover. There's this shed over here.
[1142.65s -> 1146.65s]  Glad it took three weeks. Blame, blame Cox Communications.
[1148.82s -> 1155.58s]  Because these motherfuckers can't figure it out either. And it's their service. This is the shed
[1155.58s -> 1176.82s]  right? It's no. Oh the cattle shed. Like in this thing. This is not the cattle shed. Get up there.
[1176.82s -> 1183.72s]  Do I just take my glasses off? How do I get out of here? I'm sorry I haven't been paying attention.
[1183.72s -> 1198.76s]  Get in position. What cattle shed is he referring to? In here. Is this not the shed?
[1200.36s -> 1212.54s]  Stuck because no blip. No stuck because I have to look over here and watch five percent of every
[1212.54s -> 1219.82s]  frame drop. Because it's taken this company three weeks to try to fix a problem. Oh my fucking god
[1219.82s -> 1233.82s]  it's infuriating. Go back. Go to the shed. Is it the shed that's like straight in front of me here?
[1234.46s -> 1243.78s]  That looked like a cattle shed to me. The huge yellow thing. That's
[1243.78s -> 1249.91s]  isn't that where it just was? Like isn't this this is where I was. Isn't this where I was?
[1251.59s -> 1254.39s]  Highlighted in yellow. This thing here. Isn't this where it just was?
[1255.83s -> 1270.28s]  I just did this. Didn't I just do this? Excuse me. Hello. I didn't hide. Hello friend. What you want?
[1270.28s -> 1279.67s]  Very sorry to disturb you. My friends and I. Well we got in some trouble up the way. Lost in the
[1279.67s -> 1290.94s]  storm. Gentlemen. We can't help you mister. What's he gonna do? I got folks. Arthur we got a problem.
[1299.43s -> 1306.52s]  Protect Dutch. Okay. Is this guy gonna fire at him? I think you should go now.
[1329.11s -> 1342.50s]  I just like holy shit this is aiming is a little weird. What's with the aiming? It's like why is
[1342.50s -> 1367.99s]  it pulling me? I gotta change the sensitivity here. Great soundtrack. Yeah. All right. Where's it this
[1367.99s -> 1387.24s]  way? He's not gonna last by himself out there. Now he won't last at all. You didn't handle it. I had
[1387.24s -> 1411.29s]  to do something about it. I'm gonna follow him. Fucking internet companies man. Hold screen your
[1411.29s -> 1416.01s]  items. Pick them up while searching the house. We need the essentials. Food. Okay. Medicine.
[1416.89s -> 1432.81s]  Whiskey. They're gonna open pots and shit. It's cabinets. Hold near items. Pick them up while
[1432.81s -> 1440.01s]  searching. Canned sweet corn. There's a big price on Cuomo Drisco's head. Assorted biscuits.
[1443.35s -> 1451.43s]  Fruits. Whiskey is not essential. Are you serious? Your health core drains over time and is now
[1451.43s -> 1461.82s]  empty while empty you will experience negative effects. Do you have to eat in this game? Okay.
[1461.82s -> 1470.55s]  Slowly restores health core and moderately restores stamina core. Interesting. And then
[1470.55s -> 1478.02s]  we have to go bake beans so that I get a middle is your core. Slightly reduce restores health core.
[1478.02s -> 1488.25s]  All right. Let's just do this in the middle one first. Let's just try it out. Survival mode it
[1488.33s -> 1505.03s]  seems like. Better quality food will refill more core. Okay. I gotta like refill my four cores.
[1505.67s -> 1523.83s]  Let's look around for some more stuff. Just controls how fast you refill your health and stamina.
[1524.55s -> 1534.73s]  It's better than nothing. There's a lot of random shit on the mantle. Examine the
[1534.73s -> 1542.62s]  photograph. Sure. Let's get some lore. Poor bastard was married to. Okay. Flip it around.
[1543.18s -> 1561.78s]  Secret code on the back. Quake and ID wedding. Jet. I can't read it. Oh, there we go. Okay.
[1566.84s -> 1574.66s]  I'm just kidding. Oh look it's from the first game. That's the cottage from the first game.
[1574.66s -> 1588.74s]  All right. What's we got? $2.43. Have we dropped a frame in the last like 15 minutes? Can anybody
[1588.74s -> 1601.35s]  tell? Or do I have to like do I have to like scream as loud as I can? I have. God damn it.
[1601.35s -> 1610.70s]  Well I say it now and now I just did right here. I think that's all I can get.
[1614.25s -> 1621.06s]  Keep looking for stuff. Arthur go see if there's anything in that barn. Okay. Micah
[1621.06s -> 1628.68s]  you search the cabin. See what we missed. Sure. All right. Let's go investigate the barn.
[1628.76s -> 1635.24s]  I'm gonna go take a look and I'm gonna go examine it. No drop frames since the fight.
[1635.24s -> 1639.66s]  Now you can look at the current objective. What's that? Is that a bad guy? Good guy?
[1639.66s -> 1655.00s]  Another thing there. The atmosphere is great. Yeah. So far it looks awesome. That guy just
[1655.00s -> 1674.63s]  top rope shot. Hey what's happening in here? That guy didn't get one hit in. Should you kill him?
[1675.27s -> 1684.31s]  Not yet. Interrogate. Find out what they're doing. All right. Beat him. Oh that son of a
[1684.31s -> 1691.42s]  bitch would talk. This is just like the Punisher game. Where is he? Where is he?
[1699.93s -> 1708.54s]  Okay. What are you? Anything else? Why are you up here? Fiction to rob some train.
[1709.26s -> 1714.68s]  Gonna blow the tracks. No I don't know more. I swear. Thanks for the info buddy.
[1715.88s -> 1723.00s]  But say it looks like you have this Arthur. Anything else? What was the last time you shat
[1723.00s -> 1732.36s]  your pants? When you're done. Joven. When did it happen? When? When was the last time you shat
[1732.36s -> 1755.24s]  your pants? Let's try to grab him again. He's like come here I'm not done with you. Oh there
[1755.32s -> 1768.14s]  animals over here? What the fuck? What's happening? Wait what? I have to restart the whole thing?
[1769.32s -> 1784.14s]  Oh shit. Wasted. By walking out of the frame. Oh god damn it. Well all right.
[1789.05s -> 1794.09s]  Tell us. Tell us again. First passing hug. I can't keep up.
[1794.25s -> 1807.16s]  Wasted here. Near the light. What are you bastards? His clothes changed? Why? Fiction to rob some
[1807.16s -> 1813.94s]  train. Gonna blow the tracks. No I don't know the net. I swear. That's his worst mission boundaries
[1813.94s -> 1819.46s]  than in GTA 5. Well I would say it looks like you have this Arthur. Do what you want with him.
[1819.46s -> 1823.54s]  All right so now we get a second chance. Should I spare him? Remember saving Private Ryan.
[1824.66s -> 1829.77s]  This motherfucker's gonna come back. I don't want to do that. I don't. But what if he comes back?
[1831.05s -> 1857.51s]  Where's my gun? Focus on the horse. Where are you? In the barn? How'd you get in here?
[1859.38s -> 1863.54s]  How did you get in here? Well I can calm the horse. This is not my horse.
[1864.42s -> 1881.14s]  What if this is gonna freak out and start hitting me? This looks animatronic. I don't know if I
[1881.14s -> 1888.84s]  trust it. It's animatronic. Don't ever stand behind a horse. That's what I was told.
[1898.31s -> 1904.25s]  Check his balls. No. All right let's lead the horse. Continuing to bomb with your horse increases
[1904.25s -> 1916.76s]  its trust in you and improves its attributes. The horse has now become your horse as indicated by a
[1917.72s -> 1924.70s]  blip on the radar. Okay. Yeah figured he won't get far. We still fucking dropped. Yeah.
[1930.44s -> 1939.24s]  God damn it. This is like I'm like really containing myself right now. I'm like I am
[1939.24s -> 1945.94s]  like a I'm holding back but this has been like an infuriating process.
[1949.75s -> 1964.78s]  Hmm. Literally moved across the country to a different fucking state. Got a faster line
[1966.63s -> 1982.74s]  and it's worse than it was before. That's unbelievable. With a different company. A gigabit
[1982.74s -> 1994.76s]  connection. Thousand fucking megabits a second. Eventually it's gonna get fixed but who fucking
[1994.76s -> 2007.50s]  knows when. Maybe you're the problem. I don't think so. I haven't had enough time to be the
[2007.50s -> 2026.87s]  problem. Turned on the modem. Got an IP. That's it. Oh what the fuck? Get off me.
[2028.55s -> 2029.99s]  Hold on. Come in here boy. Let's go.
[2030.87s -> 2038.14s]  I didn't hit the wall.
[2048.42s -> 2050.42s]  Just keep going west until you get there.
[2070.84s -> 2093.58s]  I mean that fire wasn't bad. You could just jump on that thing and roll around and it would have
[2093.58s -> 2094.54s]  gone off.
[2095.10s -> 2105.86s]  Of course it's okay. We're bad men. We ain't them. It's okay.
[2107.98s -> 2114.79s]  Get on. We'll keep you safe until you figure out what you want to do. What's your name miss?
[2115.75s -> 2122.94s]  Miss. Adler. Adler. What is it that you're used to calling an easy during a blizzard?
[2126.66s -> 2130.12s]  He he was my husband.
[2151.32s -> 2159.99s]  Hey somebody's coming. Looks like it's Dutch. Hey everybody Dutch is back. We good. How'd you get
[2159.99s -> 2168.31s]  on? Micah found a homestead but he weren't the first. Colm or Driscoll and his scum they beat
[2168.31s -> 2178.66s]  us to it. We found some of them there but there is more about apparently scouting the train.
[2179.46s -> 2186.58s]  Thank you. This is not on PC unfortunately. Well it is what it is but we found some supplies some
[2186.58s -> 2193.86s]  blankets a little bit of food and this poor soul Mrs. Adler Miss Tilly Miss Karen would you warm
[2193.86s -> 2202.66s]  her up give her a drink or something and Mrs. Adler it's gonna be okay you're safe now they
[2202.66s -> 2206.74s]  turned her into a widow. He might never be on PC but the last one wasn't either. That's like
[2206.74s -> 2212.66s]  the unfortunate thing. I need some rest. I haven't slept in three days. You're over here. Miss O'Shea
[2212.66s -> 2218.82s]  I'll show you the way. Mr. Morgan we put you in a room over here. Thank you Miss Grimshaw.
[2218.82s -> 2224.66s]  Mr. Bell here with the fellas over there. Well how come Arthur gets a room and I get a bunk bed
[2224.66s -> 2237.88s]  next to Bill Williamson and a bunch of darkies. Get yourself to bed. Rocks are a bunch of idiots
[2238.68s -> 2245.82s]  for not putting it on PC. Yeah I don't know there's got to be some reason why. It does not but I
[2245.82s -> 2256.68s]  really wonder. He ain't been seen in days. The weather ain't let up. He's strong and he's smart.
[2256.68s -> 2270.09s]  Strong at least. Hello Arthur. Abigail. Arthur how you doing? Just fine Abigail and you? I need
[2270.09s -> 2277.05s]  you to I'm sorry I'm sorry to ask but. It's little John. He's got himself caught into a scrape again.
[2277.05s -> 2286.41s]  He ain't been seen in two hours. Two days. Your John will be fine. I mean he may be as dumb as rocks
[2286.41s -> 2292.41s]  and as dull as rusted iron but that ain't changing because he got caught in some snowstorm. Please go
[2292.41s -> 2300.81s]  take a look. Javier? Yes. Javier will you ride out with Arthur to take a look for John? You're the two
[2300.81s -> 2311.85s]  best fit men we've got. Now? We're all pretty worried about him. I know the situation were
[2311.85s -> 2327.40s]  reversed and he looked for me. Thank you. British accent? This way. Last I know John was headed up
[2327.40s -> 2338.02s]  the river. We know he kept riding north. Not like that. That emote is making my chat scroll
[2338.02s -> 2346.25s]  horizontally. Wait what? Wait what? Wait hold on. What are you talking about?
[2351.21s -> 2355.69s]  It's time to find John. Alright I need to like get happy. I'm like sad right now because of this
[2355.69s -> 2361.05s]  internet bullshit. I gotta get like excited. This is Red Dead Redemption 2. This is not like
[2362.01s -> 2370.68s]  another iPad game. Hey I see some smoke. Come on let's take a look. Let's hope it ain't more of
[2370.68s -> 2383.56s]  O'Driscoll's boys. Seems somebody left recently. Let's do some investigating reporting here.
[2384.76s -> 2390.17s]  Did he do it? Did he do it? Did he do it? Did he do it? Are we not going to like it anyways? What?
[2390.17s -> 2397.21s]  What? I loved the first one. The first one was great. Let's inspect the camp.
[2398.17s -> 2403.34s]  But what? There could be dust. There could be fingerprints or finger dust on here.
[2407.29s -> 2414.84s]  Fine. Alright fine fine fine. I wanted to fucking dust for fingerprints and he didn't want to do
[2414.84s -> 2424.25s]  shit. Watch out watch out. Hot hot hot hot. Ow burning burning. Burn. Burn my horse's legs.
[2429.62s -> 2437.77s]  Stamina drains when your horse gallops or jumps. I can't see anything.
[2437.77s -> 2442.25s]  We had the money. It seemed fine. Somebody turn the antennas around.
[2442.25s -> 2450.33s]  Bounty hunters? No Pinkerton. It was crazy. Raining bullets. That lake was steaming.
[2450.97s -> 2456.18s]  Well this is a beautiful mountain though. Watch out for this crevice.
[2457.22s -> 2469.53s]  To change camera distance and perspective press. It wouldn't even let me do the YouTuber joke. Come
[2469.69s -> 2481.50s]  on. Why? Come on. Oh what? Sorry. I got off track. Let me just look. Whoa!
[2501.29s -> 2507.02s]  The horse wouldn't do it. But you get off and you can do it. The horse is smarter.
[2507.10s -> 2513.26s]  See they continue up that way. That fall was so stupid too. It was like he lost control of all
[2513.26s -> 2521.50s]  of his body and function. And that like ahhhh. It was like Emperor Palpatine. He was thrown into
[2521.50s -> 2526.30s]  the thing in the end of the fourth movie. He just did the Emperor Palpatine scream.
[2527.66s -> 2535.67s]  We had the money. It seemed fine. Then suddenly they were everywhere. Hunters? No Pinkerton.
[2536.15s -> 2546.12s]  It was crazy. All right so I got the stamina bar. Take it slow. The horse bar has the horseshoe.
[2546.84s -> 2557.40s]  Okay so that's distance. That's what I want. Fps boat. Bad way. But it was a bad situation.
[2557.40s -> 2575.70s]  That ain't like him though. Okay not gonna do it. There's some tracks leading to the river.
[2576.26s -> 2589.88s]  It's not funny. I'm sorry. It's not funny. Wait that was a bear? What are you talking about a bear?
[2592.60s -> 2595.40s]  That was I was trying to turn around because I was making the fake.
[2596.84s -> 2604.84s]  It's not funny. It is funny. It is funny. Whatever. It was a bear? I don't think it was a bear.
[2605.64s -> 2609.16s]  We had the money. It seemed fine. Was it a bear?
[2611.78s -> 2619.22s]  Pinkerton. It was crazy. No bullets. It's not funny. Please stop. I'm sorry.
[2620.26s -> 2629.88s]  Take it slow. Big ravine here. Get me. I'm not going over there. Dutch killed a girl. My side.
[2630.52s -> 2642.23s]  Bad way. But it was a bad situation. That ain't like him though. Tracks go left. Down here.
[2643.19s -> 2653.83s]  Baby got shot. I'm not doing it one more time. Both shot too. Sean we don't even know. I'm
[2653.83s -> 2657.91s]  surprised we escaped at all. By the time you boys showed up from the other side of town.
[2658.71s -> 2668.22s]  Only just holding on to that business all right. Activate cinematic camera. Hold this button down.
[2668.22s -> 2672.86s]  Damn snow's coming in hard again. We'll lose these tracks if we don't move fast.
[2672.86s -> 2677.74s]  Automatically follow roads. Oh that's so you can. It's like watching an actual movie.
[2678.70s -> 2688.58s]  Nice. Change cinematic camera press R3. All right that there's a lot of there's a lot of use cases
[2688.58s -> 2708.86s]  for this I think. But am I still controlling the character? Oh shit yeah I am. That's hard to do.
[2709.66s -> 2717.34s]  All right I'm gonna play the whole game like this. I'm gonna be the first streamer on Twitch.
[2718.06s -> 2734.14s]  The first guy on Twitch to do it only in cinematic mode. Looks like you know when you
[2734.14s -> 2749.51s]  were 14 and you made that machinima. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm not gonna turn it off.
[2750.23s -> 2765.54s]  Why would I turn this off? Oh wow let's investigate. He was riding this horse.
[2769.59s -> 2789.10s]  Hell. Where? Up here. I heard it from this way. Is this the right way? Am I going the
[2789.10s -> 2810.09s]  right way? I gotta get it out of my system now. Oh shit. Okay don't. Okay no no no no. Just relax.
[2813.05s -> 2814.97s]  I'm not gonna fucking do it again. I'm sorry.
[2822.62s -> 2832.90s]  I have like the cinematic mode. I'm trying. I can't do it yet. Let's give me the prompt.
[2837.30s -> 2842.74s]  The first five minutes of the game. I'm having fun though. I'm actually gonna try to play the
[2842.74s -> 2846.82s]  whole game in cinematic mode. That'll be my schnick right? Like what the fuck?
[2848.42s -> 2852.50s]  Livestreamer plays entire Red Dead 2 in cinematic camera?
[2858.17s -> 2867.43s]  Okay here we go. No I'm not I'm not gonna jump. I'm not falling off another edge.
[2867.43s -> 2879.83s]  That is a 100% guarantee. Like I can 100% guarantee. If I fall off the edge in the
[2879.83s -> 2884.63s]  next like minute or two in this like little tutorial I will do 100 push-ups in a row on camera.
[2893.11s -> 2893.67s]  All right here we go.
[2893.67s -> 2897.19s]  I'm coming in hard again. We'll lose these tracks if we don't move fast.
[2898.07s -> 2917.90s]  Oh good. Take the germ attacks 30%. It adds the bars too that's important. I'm not gonna fall.
[2917.90s -> 2930.22s]  I'm doing the thing that's impossible. You cannot fall like this. It's not possible. I'm holding X.
[2930.78s -> 2948.82s]  Watch yourself. I'm tensed up right now like you wouldn't believe. Yeah a lot of fresh snow here.
[2950.22s -> 2957.98s]  I like this one. How am I gonna aim and shoot at people with cinematic camera? Is that possible?
[2966.04s -> 2975.40s]  So close to the edge yeah. She has to guess. You can't I can't just guess.
[2977.59s -> 2985.22s]  This is beautiful though. Let's get a different angle here. Let's see if he can hear us.
[2985.94s -> 2999.02s]  So John is here somewhere. All right I'm gonna follow him. Up there. Don't say up there.
[2999.74s -> 3013.58s]  Okay I'm gonna follow you. Don't push me off. All right here we go. Is it do I go over this?
[3016.31s -> 3031.94s]  All right we're good. We have to walk from here. Oh no. Oh no. Grab shotgun. Force weapons.
[3032.90s -> 3040.89s]  Okay so R1. Okay we can only heal one sidearm. So I'm gonna get the shotgun.
[3042.09s -> 3057.98s]  So did I lose cinematic? There we go. It's back. Wait hold on. Okay. Oh it turns off right when you
[3057.98s -> 3076.92s]  hold the button down. You can't do it. But wait is this an edge? Okay we're good. It's on. It's on.
[3077.40s -> 3089.62s]  It's coming from this way. Hey watch out here. I'm not cheating. I want to see from another angle.
[3089.62s -> 3094.26s]  I don't want to see. Holy fuck. I just that doesn't count. I fell off a ledge onto another ledge. I
[3094.26s -> 3106.73s]  didn't die. This damage is played in the lower left corner. I don't have it. Watch yourself.
[3106.73s -> 3123.06s]  Okay this doesn't count either because this is okay. Be careful here. Oh god damn it. Okay back
[3123.06s -> 3135.83s]  there. Watch your head. Yeah I'm all right. This is the most stressful thing I've done in a long time.
[3139.27s -> 3145.75s]  Am I running the lip? Watch your step. This is real slippery. Stay close to the wall. My stamina
[3145.75s -> 3159.70s]  core is empty. Square in this climb. Get access to the shaft. I need to eat something man.
[3160.58s -> 3172.12s]  That's what I need. Some stamina here. Classic oat cakes. Is there just a stamina one?
[3172.76s -> 3201.91s]  Just canned peaches is fine. That looks odd from cinematic view. All right we're doing fine.
[3203.58s -> 3213.35s]  Just eating peaches. Canned peaches are where it's at man. That's good shit.
[3221.83s -> 3232.68s]  John. John. John we'll be looking for you. John the street lights are on. You're in deep shit
[3232.68s -> 3253.29s]  when you get home. Where is he? He's in the game. He's in the game. Where is he? That's quite a
[3253.29s -> 3261.82s]  scratch you got there. Never thought I'd say this but good to see you Arthur Morgan. So he is in
[3261.82s -> 3271.75s]  the game. Wow. I don't look so good. I don't feel too good neither. I could probably do that if I
[3271.75s -> 3287.56s]  tried hard enough. Now we gotta we gotta cinematically walk him back to his car.
[3289.72s -> 3291.48s]  Oh we actually do.
[3304.74s -> 3306.90s]  I think I think this is just supposed to happen right?
[3315.90s -> 3317.74s]  If we go on the right is this supposed to be okay?
[3321.50s -> 3334.71s]  Uh-oh. Wildlife. We're being hunted by wolves. I'll distract him while you get to the horses.
[3335.67s -> 3338.55s]  Who's gonna distract him? All right yeah to get to the horses.
[3339.35s -> 3347.18s]  Keep the wolves away from both of them. Let's get you on that horse. That's just not gonna work.
[3347.90s -> 3370.22s]  Let's get away from it. No it takes it off cinematic mode. Oh well we tried.
[3372.79s -> 3384.78s]  Okay let's get going before any more of these bastards show up. Get him on the horse. You can
[3384.78s -> 3393.30s]  see you're gonna drive him? Okay do first person mode. That's actually a good idea too.
[3397.91s -> 3411.53s]  Okay where is he? Oh shit. All right yeehaw. We're gonna get a yeehaw.
[3419.70s -> 3432.42s]  Please don't commit to this. I'm not committing to it. This is not very cinematic.
[3432.42s -> 3463.22s]  Okay.
[3467.00s -> 3467.72s]  He just buried his face in the ground. Just slid.
[3475.72s -> 3477.72s]  Is this the portal soundtrack?
[3478.60s -> 3481.08s]  I don't think so.
[3486.04s -> 3490.12s]  It's really crazy that John Marsden's in this game and he just becomes Darth Vader in the next one.
[3491.08s -> 3493.08s]  You can see his origin story here. That's really cool.
[3508.84s -> 3511.56s]  Damn they're getting even the death ain't good enough for you.
[3520.34s -> 3522.58s]  We're good. I did it. I made it.
[3532.92s -> 3546.68s]  Super voice. Can I scream too? Does it help?
[3549.69s -> 3559.14s]  We got some help. We need some help. Come on help him down. Help. Here we go. One two three.
[3561.70s -> 3568.58s]  Come on let's get you warm. Thank you. Thank you both. This is a new love even by your standards.
[3569.54s -> 3575.70s]  Thank you Arthur. Thank you. Any other lost maidens need saving? Not today.
[3576.42s -> 3579.46s]  Have you and Dutch talked about how we're gonna get out of this?
[3579.54s -> 3586.50s]  I was just discussing with Herr Strauss when the weather breaks. I suppose we'll have to keep heading east. East into all that.
[3587.30s -> 3589.30s]  That civilization. I know.
[3589.86s -> 3596.50s]  The west is where our problems are worse. The west. Come on Herr Strauss. Let's get warm. Thank you, Mr. Morgan.
[3598.02s -> 3601.10s]  You never seen this game before? Is it on the Sega Genesis?
[3608.95s -> 3614.87s]  We've been running for weeks. We found shelter and been resting here.
[3617.16s -> 3619.64s]  I was just gonna scream yes, but I'm not a screamer.
[3626.55s -> 3633.59s]  Events and interesting locations are noted in your journal as you explore. Hold w to view. Hold x for details.
[3637.98s -> 3643.02s]  Log. Enter pursuit by memory. John hasn't returned from an earlier scouting trip. Arthur and
[3643.58s -> 3645.98s]  Javier ride out into the snow to look for him.
[3646.86s -> 3648.50s]  Okay.
[3648.50s -> 3652.26s]  Checklist. Kill all the wolves without taking any damage. Complete with the least 80. Didn't do either of those.
[3654.28s -> 3656.28s]  That's all right. Let's take a look at this.
[3656.28s -> 3657.88s]  Here's the journal.
[3657.88s -> 3659.86s]  I guess.
[3659.86s -> 3661.86s]  That's very bad drawing.
[3663.74s -> 3665.74s]  You know when like somebody asks you for directions
[3666.62s -> 3668.62s]  and you draw them a terrible map of intersections?
[3669.74s -> 3671.74s]  What's it just looks like?
[3676.07s -> 3678.87s]  Uh, okay. So, uh, and
[3680.95s -> 3682.95s]  Can I just draw in here too?
[3683.75s -> 3693.00s]  What is this book? Why would I not use this piece of paper on the left? It's a waste of trees.
[3695.40s -> 3696.68s]  Is it the white house?
[3696.68s -> 3700.65s]  We're safe. Stay strong.
[3702.79s -> 3704.79s]  Oh, okay. Blacksmithing.
[3707.18s -> 3708.94s]  I can't read this.
[3708.94s -> 3714.12s]  Oh, thank god it can be translated.
[3718.33s -> 3723.83s]  That's kind of cool.
[3723.83s -> 3725.83s]  Continue playing to unlock your bonus content.
[3726.73s -> 3730.97s]  Oh, I'm one of the suckers that spent 80 dollars to get like the one mission that nobody else gets.
[3733.83s -> 3735.67s]  I feel real great about that purchase, by the way.
[3736.31s -> 3752.57s]  All right, let's just go. Let's just do some shit. We got our mini map here.
[3753.37s -> 3762.55s]  Got a horse. Yeah.
[3762.55s -> 3768.57s]  Hold L2 to talk.
[3768.57s -> 3771.45s]  33 year old substitute teacher can't read cursing.
[3781.77s -> 3788.49s]  Let's go.
[3788.49s -> 3790.49s]  I haven't been a substitute teacher in a long time.
[3793.00s -> 3795.00s]  All right. All right, let's talk. L2, greet.
[3797.72s -> 3808.90s]  Another cold morning.
[3808.90s -> 3811.53s]  What? What is it doing? Wait, why?
[3812.09s -> 3817.94s]  Why did it make me get off for it to go to the bathroom? Get over here.
[3818.66s -> 3820.66s]  What are you doing? Hey!
[3821.54s -> 3824.82s]  Come here. Come back here. What are you going?
[3829.86s -> 3831.86s]  All right, relax.
[3835.37s -> 3840.55s]  Shit and run.
[3840.55s -> 3842.55s]  I guess we can do B or P.
[3843.35s -> 3853.21s]  Let's just do wits right here. Let's just do P.
[3859.21s -> 3861.21s]  B or P.
[3874.81s -> 3889.69s]  I don't feel like being laughed at by the likes of you two. Stop it now.
[3890.41s -> 3895.45s]  You fools punching each other when Como Driscoll's needing punching hard.
[3895.45s -> 3897.85s]  You want to sit around waiting for him to come find us?
[3898.41s -> 3901.53s]  All of you, we got work to do. All right, I have the team mission.
[3901.53s -> 3903.53s]  Are you sure about this, Dutch? Yes.
[3903.53s -> 3906.73s]  Pope's been through a lot recently. We hardly back on our feet yet.
[3906.73s -> 3910.41s]  And the last thing we need is to get Bushwhacked by Como Driscoll.
[3910.41s -> 3911.45s]  Let's go.
[3911.45s -> 3914.81s]  I know you hate him, Dutch. He's here for us.
[3914.81s -> 3915.85s]  I doubt that.
[3915.85s -> 3919.61s]  No, you're just doubting me. I would never doubt you, Dutch.
[3919.61s -> 3924.65s]  You always said revenge is a luxury we can't afford.
[3924.65s -> 3927.85s]  This is a right call, Arthur. Take this.
[3927.85s -> 3929.85s]  Why does he just sound like a pitch-shifted version of him?
[3930.01s -> 3937.42s]  They were talking about trains, detonators.
[3937.42s -> 3942.70s]  Here, Combe always had good information. Come on.
[3943.26s -> 3946.86s]  And you think now is the right time to hit a train?
[3946.86s -> 3953.34s]  Now you, my fancy living on deer piss and rabbit shit, I'm getting too old for that life.
[3954.06s -> 3960.06s]  Mr. Matthews, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pearson, would you please look after the place?
[3960.06s -> 3961.98s]  There are old Driscolls about.
[3962.62s -> 3965.34s]  Voice crack, voice crack. Everyone laugh at him, right?
[3965.34s -> 3966.22s]  You laugh at me.
[3968.22s -> 3969.90s]  And that guy's way stronger than all of you.
[3969.90s -> 3972.17s]  Southwest, right, Arthur?
[3972.17s -> 3975.06s]  You should follow the main trail southwest.
[3975.06s -> 3977.14s]  Right, point it out. Everybody point it out in the chat, right?
[3977.94s -> 3980.46s]  Let's go find these bastards.
[3980.46s -> 3985.85s]  All right, so we're gonna go. This is a robbery.
[3985.85s -> 3987.69s]  Cinematic mode, automatic. I didn't even.
[3987.69s -> 3989.13s]  Automatic cinematic. I didn't even do it.
[3989.85s -> 3993.86s]  Somebody turn on the AC. It's getting hot in here.
[3993.86s -> 3994.82s]  Automatic cinematic.
[3997.58s -> 3999.90s]  I'll scold myself for that one later in the shower, I promise.
[4007.61s -> 4008.97s]  I'm sorry. I've been away for like three weeks.
[4009.69s -> 4015.38s]  I'm gonna be in the shower being like with my hand up,
[4015.38s -> 4018.10s]  wicked hot water just going like, fucking stupid.
[4019.08s -> 4021.24s]  Don't ever say something like that again.
[4021.24s -> 4026.92s]  It must be this way.
[4029.77s -> 4031.13s]  You good, Dutch?
[4031.13s -> 4038.44s]  Listen, I know you don't think much of my eyes recently, but this is the right move.
[4038.44s -> 4039.27s]  Okay.
[4039.27s -> 4039.75s]  Debatable.
[4040.71s -> 4041.45s]  You know I'm gonna be back.
[4041.45s -> 4042.49s]  Stream the shower.
[4042.49s -> 4047.22s]  You learned a long time ago that you hit Como Driscolls.
[4047.22s -> 4048.42s]  No drop frames, by the way.
[4048.42s -> 4049.94s]  I get to get out of meltdown mode.
[4049.94s -> 4051.46s]  I'm in the fun, fun mode.
[4068.60s -> 4075.67s]  Just give it 10 minutes for me to pull off on another like audibly upset.
[4075.67s -> 4079.03s]  You know like the difference when somebody's like, oh, I'm pissed off.
[4079.03s -> 4080.07s]  What the heck, man?
[4080.07s -> 4082.23s]  Whoa, I can't believe I died there.
[4082.23s -> 4083.03s]  What's happening here?
[4083.03s -> 4083.91s]  Oh, damn it.
[4084.79s -> 4087.99s]  First, when you start talking like this, like this fucking stupid fucking thing,
[4087.99s -> 4089.91s]  like when you, that's how you know somebody's really angry.
[4089.91s -> 4092.23s]  And they start like, they get like kind of internally,
[4092.23s -> 4093.51s]  they're so hot and they're nervous and shit.
[4093.51s -> 4094.87s]  Like they start fucking getting angry like that.
[4095.67s -> 4096.71s]  It's not like, what the fuck?
[4096.71s -> 4098.23s]  Whoa, I died in the game.
[4098.23s -> 4099.19s]  Oh, I'm so mad.
[4107.85s -> 4112.89s]  Whoa.
[4112.89s -> 4113.85s]  Are we birds?
[4113.85s -> 4114.65s]  All right, gentlemen.
[4115.72s -> 4116.92s]  This is it.
[4116.92s -> 4121.67s]  We goddamn ready.
[4121.67s -> 4122.79s]  Ready, Dutch.
[4122.79s -> 4123.51s]  Good.
[4123.51s -> 4124.55s]  That was very, very good.
[4124.55s -> 4125.99s]  That was like a classroom attendance.
[4125.99s -> 4128.86s]  This morning, we're gonna head up here a little.
[4128.86s -> 4131.18s]  See if we can't get a sense of the layout of the camp.
[4132.14s -> 4137.26s]  Mr. Williamson, Mr. Bell, you two take up a hidden position just outside the camp.
[4137.98s -> 4143.02s]  Mr. Summers, Mr. Escuela, you two hold position here.
[4144.81s -> 4145.31s]  Let's go.
[4149.67s -> 4150.17s]  All right.
[4154.17s -> 4154.81s]  All right.
[4154.81s -> 4155.61s]  Throw haymaker.
[4156.70s -> 4157.50s]  I'm depleting.
[4162.12s -> 4163.96s]  This is absolutely beautiful.
[4163.96s -> 4165.08s]  You know, this is beautiful.
[4166.79s -> 4173.80s]  It's just beautiful out here.
[4173.80s -> 4175.00s]  That was at the same time.
[4175.56s -> 4178.22s]  Here they are.
[4178.22s -> 4180.34s]  That's definitely them.
[4180.34s -> 4182.50s]  Holy shit, this is what it looks like to look through his eyes.
[4182.50s -> 4183.14s]  I think so.
[4183.14s -> 4184.26s]  Gotta go to a doctor, man.
[4184.26s -> 4185.14s]  Yeah, that's it.
[4185.14s -> 4186.02s]  You didn't do prescription.
[4190.15s -> 4191.59s]  You got astigmatism, bro.
[4196.57s -> 4198.09s]  All right, headshot from all the way back here.
[4198.73s -> 4208.68s]  What was wrong with that one?
[4208.68s -> 4211.13s]  Who's he talking to?
[4211.93s -> 4213.61s]  He don't seem very happy.
[4220.47s -> 4221.43s]  They leaving?
[4221.43s -> 4222.31s]  Seem to be.
[4222.31s -> 4223.43s]  Should we go get them?
[4223.43s -> 4223.93s]  No.
[4224.95s -> 4225.83s]  Cole can wait.
[4226.79s -> 4228.47s]  Best to get some of them out of there.
[4229.03s -> 4230.62s]  All right, so we're gonna sneak up.
[4231.58s -> 4233.98s]  Metal Gear Solid 3 Neck Snap.
[4233.98s -> 4234.48s]  Two of them.
[4239.27s -> 4240.87s]  I was hoping I could see his big eyes.
[4241.51s -> 4242.95s]  Like Macaulay Culkin style.
[4254.46s -> 4257.42s]  Weapons not set on your load before dismounting will remain on your horse.
[4257.42s -> 4258.78s]  Pick them off from up there.
[4258.78s -> 4259.74s]  You got it, Dutch.
[4259.74s -> 4264.10s]  All right, so we got...
[4267.29s -> 4270.15s]  Approach your horse to view store.
[4270.15s -> 4271.11s]  Hold L...
[4271.11s -> 4271.61s]  Do it.
[4272.65s -> 4275.34s]  Okay, so where's the rifle?
[4275.90s -> 4277.85s]  Right here.
[4278.57s -> 4282.33s]  Long arm back carbine or carbine repeater.
[4284.78s -> 4286.06s]  Oh, that's just the slot it's in.
[4286.06s -> 4287.18s]  Okay, I get it.
[4287.82s -> 4289.50s]  And I'll take the shotgun too.
[4289.50s -> 4290.00s]  What?
[4290.38s -> 4295.90s]  Horse weapons.
[4295.90s -> 4300.03s]  We'll circle around the far side and go down that way.
[4300.03s -> 4300.99s]  Same as Micah and Bill.
[4300.99s -> 4301.47s]  Change sense.
[4301.47s -> 4301.87s]  Yeah, that's...
[4301.87s -> 4302.43s]  I probably should.
[4302.43s -> 4303.79s]  Like you said, revenge.
[4303.79s -> 4304.67s]  I'll get it right eventually.
[4304.67s -> 4306.03s]  We can't afford.
[4306.03s -> 4309.39s]  Yeah, just wasn't sure you agreed with me.
[4309.39s -> 4309.71s]  Arthur.
[4309.71s -> 4310.83s]  Does this stay winter the whole game?
[4310.83s -> 4313.79s]  Arthur, have you completely lost faith in me?
[4313.87s -> 4319.07s]  Our needs right now are supplies, equipment, and a way out of here.
[4319.79s -> 4322.03s]  Everything else, including coal.
[4323.56s -> 4327.88s]  Okay, there's enough of those bastards down there to deal with as it is.
[4328.76s -> 4332.43s]  All right, so we're gonna go carbine.
[4335.76s -> 4336.96s]  Not every area is snow.
[4337.60s -> 4339.76s]  Well, it's good at least that they put it in.
[4341.05s -> 4344.17s]  It's not just the desert and only the desert.
[4347.98s -> 4349.66s]  Take a shot every time somebody says okay.
[4354.19s -> 4355.55s]  All right, no fucking around here.
[4355.95s -> 4357.87s]  Look at how funny the streamer is jokes here.
[4358.75s -> 4359.96s]  You know what I'm saying?
[4359.96s -> 4360.76s]  And we already got that.
[4360.76s -> 4361.88s]  We got a cinematic mode.
[4361.88s -> 4362.60s]  Oh, LOL.
[4362.60s -> 4364.12s]  And then, oh, I fell off three times.
[4364.12s -> 4365.08s]  LOL.
[4365.08s -> 4366.44s]  And then, you know, I'm not doing that again.
[4367.32s -> 4374.92s]  Steve here.
[4374.92s -> 4382.80s]  Can they see us?
[4382.80s -> 4390.01s]  I don't think I should be crouched.
[4390.01s -> 4390.81s]  I can't do it here.
[4390.81s -> 4392.73s]  This is such a long walk down.
[4392.73s -> 4397.21s]  Wait till I get the game to open up for me before I do any dumb shit.
[4397.93s -> 4411.12s]  Baby, I'll take the lead on this.
[4411.12s -> 4412.40s]  What a terrible stream.
[4412.40s -> 4412.56s]  Hey.
[4412.56s -> 4414.00s]  They're gonna be gunning for you.
[4414.00s -> 4414.16s]  What?
[4414.16s -> 4415.44s]  They ain't got me yet.
[4415.44s -> 4415.84s]  Why?
[4415.84s -> 4416.72s]  What happened?
[4417.04s -> 4418.24s]  I'm just playing Red Dead.
[4422.33s -> 4423.13s]  Just jump off.
[4423.13s -> 4423.29s]  No.
[4433.07s -> 4434.27s]  One guy said that.
[4435.92s -> 4437.52s]  Yeah, and he's the one guy now.
[4438.24s -> 4440.96s]  Why do I always read negative feedback?
[4440.96s -> 4442.88s]  Gosh, I need to make sure everyone's happy.
[4442.88s -> 4445.68s]  And if people are not having fun, then I want to make sure you're having fun.
[4457.13s -> 4458.17s]  I really can't fuck this up.
[4464.06s -> 4465.26s]  I got to be on point here.
[4466.38s -> 4467.90s]  No, like, where's the shed?
[4468.78s -> 4470.12s]  Is that the shed?
[4470.12s -> 4471.40s]  Why am I dropping frames?
[4471.40s -> 4471.72s]  I don't...
[4471.72s -> 4472.28s]  No, I'm...
[4477.58s -> 4478.30s]  Is that a guy?
[4478.30s -> 4479.10s]  No, that's a good guy.
[4489.90s -> 4490.62s]  Take the lead.
[4492.30s -> 4493.58s]  He's giving me an opportunity.
[4495.92s -> 4497.84s]  Look at Dutch to give instructions.
[4502.19s -> 4503.07s]  Send in the gang.
[4503.07s -> 4503.79s]  I'll take the lead.
[4518.19s -> 4521.52s]  Wait, does the sniper elite thing?
[4528.92s -> 4529.24s]  Damn it.
[4539.40s -> 4540.92s]  Tapping R2 when not aiming.
[4540.92s -> 4541.16s]  Okay.
[4542.12s -> 4544.17s]  This is the last guy.
[4544.17s -> 4545.37s]  Oh, I'm on top of the roof.
[4545.37s -> 4546.25s]  God, don't fall.
[4546.25s -> 4547.37s]  Oops, sorry.
[4547.37s -> 4548.41s]  That guy was making a video.
[4549.45s -> 4551.26s]  I should have been quiet.
[4551.26s -> 4552.22s]  That guy was, like, recording.
[4553.10s -> 4555.18s]  He's definitely, like, laughing and, like, screaming right now.
[4556.54s -> 4561.39s]  Get over there.
[4561.39s -> 4570.81s]  Pocket sensitivity.
[4571.61s -> 4575.55s]  Lord.
[4575.55s -> 4582.04s]  I got somebody.
[4582.04s -> 4582.84s]  Oh, I'm not sure.
[4583.88s -> 4600.09s]  Right through his hat.
[4600.73s -> 4604.60s]  One more guy.
[4604.60s -> 4604.92s]  Where is he?
[4604.92s -> 4605.24s]  Right here?
[4606.04s -> 4607.80s]  Oh, he just got me right in the mouth.
[4608.36s -> 4610.20s]  He showed me right in the face.
[4612.52s -> 4629.55s]  I'm actually getting shot right in the face like that.
[4642.91s -> 4643.55s]  Damn it.
[4643.55s -> 4650.08s]  Just be dead.
[4650.08s -> 4651.28s]  What did I shoot twice?
[4651.28s -> 4652.48s]  Oh, that was the slow motion.
[4656.48s -> 4657.12s]  FP.
[4657.12s -> 4658.24s]  Oh, all right.
[4658.24s -> 4659.68s]  Is this 90 FOV, though?
[4660.88s -> 4664.16s]  This just makes me want this to be on PC.
[4667.90s -> 4669.26s]  There's so many corpses, though.
[4669.26s -> 4670.06s]  How am I going to get them all?
[4671.98s -> 4677.60s]  There is a slider in the menu.
[4679.31s -> 4679.71s]  Is there?
[4680.35s -> 4684.88s]  I don't know.
[4684.88s -> 4685.04s]  What?
[4685.04s -> 4685.44s]  A camera?
[4687.63s -> 4687.95s]  Okay.
[4687.95s -> 4688.19s]  Yeah.
[4688.19s -> 4688.51s]  Okay.
[4688.51s -> 4688.99s]  It is there.
[4691.60s -> 4693.52s]  Get that fucking head bob off, please.
[4696.04s -> 4696.36s]  All right.
[4696.36s -> 4696.60s]  Cool.
[4698.44s -> 4699.64s]  Is it, uh, fly immediately?
[4705.64s -> 4706.28s]  Actually, that...
[4709.55s -> 4710.43s]  No FOV number.
[4710.43s -> 4711.87s]  It's just this one.
[4713.88s -> 4714.20s]  Bar.
[4714.84s -> 4716.04s]  Bar dragged to the edge.
[4716.68s -> 4727.00s]  Oh, hey, hey, hey.
[4727.00s -> 4728.20s]  More of them are coming in right now?
[4728.84s -> 4729.96s]  I didn't get a chance to loot.
[4735.95s -> 4736.51s]  First person.
[4745.58s -> 4750.89s]  Well, aiming sure is a thousand times better in first person.
[4750.89s -> 4752.33s]  I will definitely say that.
[4753.37s -> 4762.32s]  I'll say that.
[4773.24s -> 4773.80s]  Defend.
[4774.60s -> 4775.00s]  Is there...
[4775.00s -> 4776.12s]  Is there Deadeye in this game?
[4783.45s -> 4783.69s]  Damn.
[4783.69s -> 4784.89s]  I'm not going to knock this cat off.
[4784.89s -> 4797.48s]  I'm going to cover.
[4797.48s -> 4798.83s]  Oh, there is Deadeye.
[4798.83s -> 4799.95s]  I can even, like, see it.
[4802.08s -> 4802.72s]  Oh, shit.
[4806.06s -> 4806.86s]  Got that guy.
[4806.86s -> 4807.74s]  He's dead.
[4807.74s -> 4809.66s]  I don't have to worry about him causing any problems.
[4830.01s -> 4830.51s]  Shit.
[4836.17s -> 4839.68s]  Oh, my God.
[4843.08s -> 4843.56s]  I didn't...
[4843.56s -> 4844.20s]  I didn't want to...
[4844.20s -> 4845.08s]  I don't like that.
[4845.08s -> 4846.12s]  I didn't like that.
[4846.12s -> 4847.08s]  Holy shit.
[4856.41s -> 4857.05s]  Holy fuck.
[4857.05s -> 4858.17s]  That was insane.
[4862.28s -> 4862.84s]  All right.
[4867.98s -> 4868.46s]  New, uh...
[4868.46s -> 4869.10s]  Oh, here we go.
[4869.10s -> 4869.66s]  Weapon wheel.
[4870.75s -> 4871.55s]  Deadeye tonics.
[4871.55s -> 4872.83s]  Fully restores Deadeye.
[4872.83s -> 4873.31s]  Okay.
[4873.31s -> 4873.79s]  You can...
[4873.79s -> 4874.99s]  You release to use them.
[4875.63s -> 4877.84s]  Hides your identity while committing crimes.
[4878.56s -> 4881.16s]  Okay.
[4881.16s -> 4882.44s]  Let's bring it right back up.
[4882.44s -> 4882.60s]  All right.
[4882.60s -> 4883.40s]  Let's keep looking around.
[4883.40s -> 4884.44s]  I got this many bodies.
[4885.56s -> 4886.60s]  Do it with the shotgun?
[4889.69s -> 4890.01s]  Lord.
[4891.29s -> 4892.01s]  He didn't like it.
[4892.01s -> 4892.89s]  He loved it.
[4896.96s -> 4898.96s]  They're probably going to keep coming over here.
[4898.96s -> 4899.92s]  I guess I have to do it.
[4900.56s -> 4908.01s]  Is this...
[4908.01s -> 4909.93s]  You can actually cut people's heads off in the game?
[4911.15s -> 4911.79s]  My Lord.
[4916.72s -> 4918.08s]  Shoot the bodies with the shotgun.
[4928.04s -> 4929.32s]  Oh, man.
[4933.32s -> 4934.04s]  No way.
[4936.84s -> 4938.04s]  No fucking way.
[4938.04s -> 4939.08s]  There's, like, this...
[4939.08s -> 4939.56s]  That's...
[4939.56s -> 4940.28s]  That's insane.
[4943.26s -> 4943.82s]  That's...
[4943.82s -> 4944.38s]  It's just...
[4944.38s -> 4945.18s]  It's brutal.
[4946.06s -> 4946.86s]  Oh, man.
[4946.86s -> 4947.50s]  It's brutal.
[4947.50s -> 4948.38s]  This is brutal.
[4950.35s -> 4951.87s]  This game ain't coming out in Germany.
[4952.81s -> 4953.61s]  Like, no way.
[4954.41s -> 4958.24s]  This game ain't going to release in Japan.
[4967.84s -> 4969.84s]  Is it out in, like, Germany and Japan?
[4971.63s -> 4972.19s]  What do they do?
[4985.88s -> 4986.44s]  It is out.
[4986.44s -> 4986.68s]  Okay.
[4991.74s -> 4993.50s]  Blood confirmed it is out in Germany.
[4993.50s -> 4993.98s]  As is?
[4995.82s -> 4996.54s]  Wow.
[4996.54s -> 5000.59s]  Well, hold on.
[5000.59s -> 5000.99s]  Yeah.
[5000.99s -> 5001.95s]  I have to loot everybody.
[5001.95s -> 5003.55s]  You can't give me all these exes here.
[5010.09s -> 5011.85s]  Got somebody's belt buckle?
[5016.88s -> 5017.36s]  I will.
[5017.36s -> 5017.92s]  But just hold on.
[5018.40s -> 5019.60s]  There could be money on everybody.
[5023.61s -> 5024.41s]  89 cents?
[5025.13s -> 5026.65s]  I'm just collecting bits right now.
[5027.47s -> 5028.19s]  What does this guy have?
[5028.19s -> 5029.15s]  What does this guy have on him?
[5030.68s -> 5033.72s]  Hey, thank you for the championship belt.
[5036.99s -> 5037.55s]  Big bits.
[5037.55s -> 5037.95s]  All right.
[5037.95s -> 5038.59s]  We'll look for, like...
[5039.23s -> 5039.63s]  Come on.
[5039.63s -> 5040.11s]  What do you got?
[5041.72s -> 5041.96s]  No.
[5042.68s -> 5043.58s]  That guy's not even...
[5043.58s -> 5044.38s]  That guy's not a sub.
[5045.10s -> 5046.56s]  Come on.
[5046.56s -> 5047.52s]  We don't even have, like, a sub?
[5056.54s -> 5057.26s]  What?
[5057.26s -> 5060.72s]  How many people here aren't even subbed?
[5061.36s -> 5064.01s]  All right.
[5064.01s -> 5064.89s]  I gotta cut that out.
[5071.84s -> 5073.12s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[5074.00s -> 5074.24s]  All right.
[5074.24s -> 5078.06s]  What do we got here?
[5078.06s -> 5079.42s]  He's on to us.
[5079.42s -> 5081.05s]  Because he's...
[5081.05s -> 5081.53s]  I'm just...
[5081.53s -> 5082.17s]  I'm not...
[5082.17s -> 5082.41s]  No.
[5082.41s -> 5085.13s]  I don't care if you aren't subscribed.
[5087.05s -> 5087.53s]  Don't worry.
[5090.43s -> 5095.96s]  Chewing tobacco?
[5095.96s -> 5096.20s]  Cool.
[5099.08s -> 5100.20s]  Pressuring fans.
[5100.92s -> 5102.46s]  No, you guys know that.
[5102.46s -> 5103.02s]  It's not a...
[5103.02s -> 5103.66s]  I don't care.
[5104.38s -> 5110.48s]  Oh, there's an upper le...
[5110.48s -> 5112.00s]  Oh, there's a Fortnite chest up here!
[5112.64s -> 5113.76s]  What's in here?
[5113.76s -> 5114.64s]  Epic!
[5114.64s -> 5115.44s]  Is it an epic?
[5119.07s -> 5119.63s]  Holy shit.
[5119.63s -> 5120.03s]  Somebody's...
[5121.40s -> 5123.72s]  Hey, the great Lord Walden just gave out
[5123.72s -> 5127.63s]  20 tier 1 community subs.
[5127.63s -> 5128.51s]  Thank you.
[5128.51s -> 5130.04s]  Thank you so much, dude.
[5134.99s -> 5136.91s]  20, 20 subs here from Walden.
[5136.91s -> 5137.39s]  Thanks, man.
[5142.01s -> 5142.73s]  Oh, my Lord.
[5142.73s -> 5143.53s]  No, no, that's not...
[5143.53s -> 5144.65s]  This is not what...
[5144.65s -> 5146.41s]  Thank you for the 10 subs, Afrik.
[5148.28s -> 5148.68s]  Thank you.
[5154.43s -> 5155.63s]  Oh, here it comes.
[5158.33s -> 5161.72s]  I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut.
[5162.52s -> 5163.48s]  But thank you, guys.
[5164.36s -> 5166.04s]  Unnecessary, but thank you.
[5166.68s -> 5170.30s]  All right.
[5170.30s -> 5171.18s]  I gotta search up here.
[5171.74s -> 5173.93s]  There's still things that I need to get.
[5174.41s -> 5177.95s]  Okay, that hurt.
[5177.95s -> 5179.69s]  What else is in here?
[5183.55s -> 5184.19s]  Sub...
[5184.19s -> 5185.31s]  Oh, there's a chest.
[5185.31s -> 5186.83s]  I told you there's a Fortnite chest in here.
[5189.68s -> 5189.92s]  Take.
[5193.28s -> 5193.52s]  Take.
[5193.52s -> 5194.08s]  Is it a knife?
[5195.44s -> 5196.48s]  $2.12.
[5198.75s -> 5200.35s]  And cigarettes.
[5204.86s -> 5205.18s]  Whoa.
[5209.40s -> 5210.04s]  What is it?
[5210.04s -> 5211.16s]  Is this dynamite?
[5211.16s -> 5212.28s]  How would I even climb this?
[5224.04s -> 5225.31s]  But thank you, though.
[5225.31s -> 5226.43s]  Those guys giving out those subs.
[5227.23s -> 5228.12s]  Really appreciate it.
[5230.83s -> 5232.27s]  Did we get everything?
[5232.27s -> 5233.07s]  Think so, boss.
[5233.71s -> 5235.15s]  Found this on one of them.
[5235.15s -> 5235.63s]  Thank you.
[5236.51s -> 5237.47s]  This is perfect.
[5238.27s -> 5239.31s]  Oh, yeah.
[5239.31s -> 5239.87s]  Interesting.
[5240.59s -> 5243.15s]  This is something about the train they was gonna rob.
[5243.15s -> 5243.71s]  Train mission.
[5243.71s -> 5244.19s]  I bought it.
[5244.19s -> 5244.67s]  It was $20.
[5244.67s -> 5246.83s]  A Mr. Leviticus Cornwall.
[5247.55s -> 5248.75s]  Mount back up.
[5248.75s -> 5249.71s]  Let's keep moving.
[5252.72s -> 5254.24s]  What does dynamite smell like?
[5254.24s -> 5255.04s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[5255.04s -> 5256.16s]  Proud of you, boys.
[5256.16s -> 5256.88s]  Proud of you, boys.
[5256.88s -> 5258.86s]  All of you.
[5258.86s -> 5259.34s]  Raisins.
[5259.34s -> 5261.85s]  Now that's tobacco.
[5261.85s -> 5263.05s]  Gunpowder smells like...
[5263.05s -> 5266.14s]  Not bad for some starving down in...
[5266.14s -> 5269.24s]  They can pummel us hard as they like.
[5269.24s -> 5270.44s]  It's hard to describe.
[5270.44s -> 5271.80s]  We'll always get back up and fight.
[5271.80s -> 5277.61s]  That's who we outlawed.
[5277.61s -> 5282.84s]  Wait until we have John, Sean back...
[5282.84s -> 5288.57s]  If you drop the frame, it's gonna happen.
[5288.57s -> 5290.65s]  I can't even get angry about it anymore.
[5290.65s -> 5294.01s]  This hit'll hurt him a lot more than anybody in the head.
[5294.01s -> 5297.69s]  You know, there's no sense crying over spilt milk.
[5297.69s -> 5298.81s]  Sorry, spilt.
[5298.81s -> 5299.53s]  It's just gonna happen.
[5299.53s -> 5300.17s]  But I guess we'll see about that.
[5300.17s -> 5303.13s]  Just thankfully it's not happening as frequently as it was the beginning of the train.
[5304.09s -> 5307.50s]  You know, he'll come after us.
[5307.50s -> 5308.38s]  Oh, of course he will.
[5308.38s -> 5311.50s]  Just like all the rest.
[5311.50s -> 5313.82s]  But we're gonna stay a step ahead of them.
[5313.82s -> 5316.36s]  Make sure we always know where they are.
[5316.36s -> 5318.76s]  Until they know where we are.
[5318.76s -> 5322.28s]  We allowed ourselves to get a step behind at Blackwater.
[5322.28s -> 5323.96s]  That won't happen again.
[5334.97s -> 5337.53s]  All right, hang in, fellas.
[5337.53s -> 5338.73s]  Let's make some ground.
[5341.92s -> 5343.12s]  Cowboy Skyrim.
[5343.84s -> 5349.08s]  Yeah, that's not a bad thing, though.
[5352.46s -> 5354.30s]  It really makes you feel like Spider-Man.
[5354.30s -> 5354.70s]  That's right.
[5364.99s -> 5367.53s]  Bring him back alive.
[5370.46s -> 5370.94s]  You got it.
[5372.41s -> 5374.81s]  Chase down and lasso Old Driscoll.
[5376.01s -> 5379.98s]  So do I get the la-
[5379.98s -> 5381.18s]  Hold and get the weapon wheel.
[5381.18s -> 5383.50s]  This is gonna bring up the lasso.
[5384.54s -> 5388.17s]  Okay, hold L2 to ready the lasso and aim it at Old Driscoll.
[5388.49s -> 5394.04s]  One of the most fun mechanics of the last game here it is.
[5408.91s -> 5410.67s]  Keep L2 held and dismount.
[5418.65s -> 5431.37s]  Let's interrogate him in the water.
[5431.37s -> 5434.08s]  Let's drown this motherfucker.
[5434.80s -> 5439.80s]  He got out.
[5447.45s -> 5451.92s]  Where did he go?
[5455.92s -> 5456.96s]  Oh, he's-
[5456.96s -> 5459.68s]  He actually is, like, getting drowned.
[5460.40s -> 5469.04s]  Give him a stone.
[5469.04s -> 5470.40s]  Yep, drop him on the back of the horse.
[5471.36s -> 5478.27s]  He might actually be able to drown.
[5480.08s -> 5480.48s]  Maybe.
[5483.28s -> 5483.78s]  Okay.
[5484.40s -> 5491.05s]  Yellow line in the radar is the shortest route in the yellow truck.
[5500.06s -> 5503.48s]  Press the thumb stick to pet the horse.
[5508.12s -> 5508.68s]  Yeah, I got him.
[5508.68s -> 5509.18s]  I pet him.
[5511.56s -> 5512.20s]  I gave him a little-
[5512.20s -> 5513.32s]  Hey, you're doing a great job.
[5518.27s -> 5518.83s]  Thank you.
[5524.30s -> 5526.32s]  Shut up.
[5526.32s -> 5540.25s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[5540.25s -> 5540.89s]  Come on, where is it?
[5540.89s -> 5541.39s]  Come on.
[5542.01s -> 5542.51s]  Come on.
[5543.37s -> 5543.87s]  Come on.
[5551.69s -> 5552.49s]  Trying to shoot the bird.
[5553.13s -> 5556.68s]  Can you throw dynamite at birds in this game?
[5556.68s -> 5557.96s]  Does it follow them like in the last one?
[5565.15s -> 5565.55s]  What bird?
[5565.55s -> 5566.43s]  The bird that was on the right.
[5572.27s -> 5572.91s]  Yes, that does-
[5572.91s -> 5574.19s]  That is still in the game.
[5584.48s -> 5584.96s]  You can try.
[5584.96s -> 5585.44s]  I mean, we'll-
[5585.44s -> 5586.24s]  Eventually we'll try.
[5603.24s -> 5604.92s]  Seeing birds from other dimensions now.
[5618.12s -> 5619.88s]  204 bones to go.
[5620.76s -> 5627.68s]  Bring him to the fire and drop him in.
[5628.94s -> 5629.98s]  We're eating good tonight.
[5637.12s -> 5638.48s]  Hold near your horse to remove him.
[5649.07s -> 5649.47s]  I would.
[5649.47s -> 5650.59s]  No, I can't right now.
[5650.59s -> 5651.47s]  We can't do that.
[5653.05s -> 5654.57s]  I'm not doing that whole thing again.
[5661.42s -> 5662.70s]  I thought I was going to start cutting him.
[5670.68s -> 5671.56s]  Uncle.
[5671.56s -> 5672.44s]  Mr. Williamson.
[5673.08s -> 5675.48s]  Tie this maggot up someplace safe.
[5675.48s -> 5677.48s]  We get him hungry first.
[5677.48s -> 5679.16s]  I got a saying, my friend.
[5680.36s -> 5682.08s]  We shoot fellas.
[5682.08s -> 5682.96s]  There's no need shooting.
[5683.68s -> 5684.72s]  Save fellas.
[5684.72s -> 5685.60s]  There's no need saving.
[5686.16s -> 5686.80s]  And feed them.
[5687.36s -> 5688.32s]  There's no need feeding.
[5689.12s -> 5692.56s]  We are going to find out what you need.
[5692.56s -> 5695.05s]  I can't believe it.
[5695.77s -> 5698.01s]  An O'Driscoll in my camp.
[5698.01s -> 5699.37s]  I ain't an O'Driscoll, mister.
[5700.25s -> 5700.73s]  I ain't-
[5700.73s -> 5703.40s]  Oh, whatever you say, son.
[5704.36s -> 5705.64s]  Well done, Arthur.
[5705.64s -> 5707.82s]  I'm just sorry we missed out on call.
[5707.82s -> 5708.62s]  Why am I still holding them?
[5708.62s -> 5709.74s]  Well, there's time enough for that.
[5710.38s -> 5713.74s]  Now, I gotta figure out if we can hit that train.
[5714.70s -> 5715.10s]  Okay.
[5726.97s -> 5728.17s]  That's a long saying.
[5737.00s -> 5737.96s]  Old friends complete.
[5738.60s -> 5741.37s]  Now we got P on the map.
[5741.37s -> 5742.65s]  Oh, excuse me.
[5742.65s -> 5744.33s]  I probably got an F.
[5746.43s -> 5748.35s]  Complete the mission without taking any health items.
[5750.88s -> 5752.16s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[5752.16s -> 5753.76s]  I got a 25% on the test.
[5754.96s -> 5766.01s]  Now, let's keep going through the tutorial.
[5766.65s -> 5770.11s]  Well, I don't-
[5770.11s -> 5771.15s]  I don't even need to get on the horse.
[5771.15s -> 5772.19s]  He's literally right here.
[5784.30s -> 5785.18s]  Stu, I'll take you.
[5785.18s -> 5786.86s]  I'm gonna starve to death up here, Mr. Morgan.
[5789.98s -> 5790.78s]  We're okay.
[5792.64s -> 5795.68s]  We have a few cans of food and a rabbit.
[5795.68s -> 5796.40s]  For what?
[5796.40s -> 5797.44s]  10, 12 people?
[5798.32s -> 5800.43s]  That was in the Navy.
[5800.43s -> 5804.03s]  I do not wish to hear about what you got up to in the Navy, Mr. Pearson.
[5805.31s -> 5806.59s]  We were stranded at sea.
[5807.47s -> 5808.91s]  For 50 days.
[5808.91s -> 5810.99s]  And you unfortunately survived.
[5812.27s -> 5816.89s]  When we ran away from Blackwater, I wasn't able to get supplies in.
[5817.85s -> 5820.57s]  Idiot streamer, idiot streamer.
[5820.57s -> 5823.45s]  Sometimes shopping trips need to be cut short.
[5824.09s -> 5824.97s]  We'll survive.
[5825.85s -> 5826.65s]  We always have.
[5827.93s -> 5829.69s]  If needs be, we can eat you.
[5829.69s -> 5830.57s]  You're the fattest.
[5831.45s -> 5833.37s]  I sent Lenny and Bill hunting and they-
[5833.37s -> 5834.33s]  Oh, ew.
[5834.33s -> 5834.65s]  Gross.
[5834.65s -> 5836.01s]  I mean, fucking disgusting.
[5836.81s -> 5839.58s]  Bill's a fool.
[5839.58s -> 5842.06s]  Unless those mountains are full of game they want to read,
[5842.06s -> 5843.98s]  ain't no wonder they found enough of this.
[5844.70s -> 5846.16s]  We'll go find something.
[5846.16s -> 5846.88s]  Come on, Arthur.
[5847.68s -> 5849.08s]  Wait a second.
[5849.08s -> 5849.58s]  Hold on.
[5851.48s -> 5851.98s]  Here.
[5852.52s -> 5854.24s]  You're gonna need something to eat out there.
[5855.12s -> 5856.64s]  Assorted salted off.
[5858.28s -> 5860.28s]  Starving will be preferable.
[5860.28s -> 5861.40s]  Come on, let's go.
[5861.40s -> 5866.36s]  Is it weird that these gross shit items that are in these games,
[5866.60s -> 5872.28s]  rotten can of beans and packed in spam that's four years expired,
[5872.28s -> 5873.08s]  I want to eat them.
[5874.04s -> 5875.88s]  If I could pull that out of history and eat it,
[5875.88s -> 5876.92s]  I would probably do it right now.
[5885.80s -> 5887.08s]  Nobody else does that?
[5887.08s -> 5888.36s]  I can't use it and you'll have to.
[5889.82s -> 5890.62s]  Bow and arrow.
[5890.62s -> 5893.90s]  Use a gun and we'll scare off every animal for miles around.
[5895.10s -> 5897.66s]  You're never too old to learn, I imagine.
[5898.38s -> 5898.88s]  You okay?
[5900.44s -> 5900.94s]  Yeah.
[5901.32s -> 5901.82s]  Yeah, man.
[5903.39s -> 5903.89s]  Yeah.
[5911.68s -> 5914.32s]  Match the speed of your cockspill.
[5922.00s -> 5928.46s]  Is that guy on YouTube that eats the old military rations?
[5929.02s -> 5929.98s]  Yeah, that channel's great.
[5932.59s -> 5939.15s]  I've put on that guy's channel and just fallen asleep to him eating old rations
[5939.15s -> 5941.47s]  and woken up at like 60 videos a player.
[5941.71s -> 5942.75s]  They'll be needing to feed.
[5944.11s -> 5948.80s]  I'm going to tap square when we're stationed from this move.
[5954.92s -> 5955.96s]  Oh, you can like hold it.
[5955.96s -> 5956.46s]  That's cool.
[5957.80s -> 5958.76s]  Is that just showing off?
[5966.99s -> 5967.79s]  I didn't wait.
[5967.79s -> 5968.67s]  I'm not saying what?
[5968.67s -> 5969.47s]  I didn't say that.
[5970.27s -> 5970.77s]  No.
[5978.36s -> 5979.64s]  I've done that to your videos.
[5979.64s -> 5980.14s]  Yeah.
[5980.84s -> 5981.34s]  Just happened.
[5995.71s -> 5997.07s]  Let's put this out on a tray.
[5997.87s -> 5999.55s]  Yeah, I know the line.
[5999.55s -> 6000.05s]  Come on.
[6000.05s -> 6001.23s]  You don't think I've ever seen it before?
[6020.46s -> 6021.66s]  Automatic cinematic.
[6032.01s -> 6034.09s]  Coffee instant cheetos.
[6035.85s -> 6036.81s]  Oh, God.
[6047.90s -> 6050.30s]  I wonder how big the actual map is when the game opens up.
[6051.02s -> 6053.34s]  But if it's too strong, they won't move.
[6053.34s -> 6061.34s]  Stay quiet.
[6061.34s -> 6062.38s]  Do a German impression?
[6062.94s -> 6063.44s]  Okay.
[6063.74s -> 6066.52s]  Stop here a second.
[6067.16s -> 6067.96s]  I see something.
[6068.60s -> 6071.96s]  I was about to just wildly make fun of myself.
[6071.96s -> 6073.32s]  Like just make fun of me.
[6074.36s -> 6075.40s]  No, I'm not doing that.
[6076.52s -> 6079.08s]  Why would I do?
[6079.08s -> 6079.58s]  No.
[6082.44s -> 6083.64s]  I've already done this before.
[6084.36s -> 6086.20s]  How can you tell?
[6087.72s -> 6088.60s]  I've already done it.
[6089.32s -> 6093.58s]  We'll track them on foot.
[6093.58s -> 6094.99s]  You're going to need the book.
[6094.99s -> 6096.91s]  Don't leave it on your whole gun.
[6096.91s -> 6098.43s]  It'll scare everything around.
[6098.43s -> 6099.95s]  Approach your horse.
[6099.95s -> 6100.75s]  Don't use the gun.
[6101.63s -> 6111.02s]  So use L2R to select a stowed weapon.
[6112.06s -> 6112.70s]  Carbine.
[6112.70s -> 6113.18s]  Bow.
[6113.18s -> 6113.82s]  That's the one.
[6115.02s -> 6118.84s]  No point setting off without that bow.
[6118.84s -> 6120.44s]  You make less noise and you crouch.
[6120.44s -> 6121.08s]  And slowly.
[6123.26s -> 6124.46s]  I'm not going to do it.
[6124.46s -> 6125.58s]  I'm not going to shoot him in the head.
[6126.30s -> 6130.67s]  You see the tracks?
[6131.23s -> 6132.19s]  I think so.
[6133.07s -> 6134.27s]  Maybe not.
[6134.27s -> 6134.91s]  I see them.
[6135.71s -> 6138.60s]  You can use eagle eye to highlight animal tracks.
[6141.39s -> 6141.63s]  Okay.
[6142.72s -> 6143.60s]  Focus on the track.
[6144.16s -> 6145.26s]  Nope.
[6145.26s -> 6152.12s]  Enable Eli to focus on the tracks to highlight them again.
[6152.76s -> 6154.75s]  Okay.
[6154.75s -> 6155.23s]  Yeah, I can.
[6155.23s -> 6155.71s]  I see it.
[6163.00s -> 6166.04s]  Your scent is also shown in eagle eye blowing in the direction of the wind.
[6166.04s -> 6167.64s]  Animals will flee if they smell your scent.
[6167.64s -> 6169.80s]  They'll remain downwind or far away when hunting.
[6170.92s -> 6181.90s]  So is this is that my smell going this way or are those those in his tracks, right?
[6182.46s -> 6189.13s]  He's going to be up here.
[6189.77s -> 6201.48s]  It's top track.
[6201.48s -> 6202.52s]  I mean, I'm just going to follow it.
[6203.24s -> 6206.96s]  22 miles per hour top right.
[6206.96s -> 6208.16s]  Which way is it going though?
[6211.28s -> 6211.76s]  This way.
[6219.13s -> 6220.25s]  Unknown animal.
[6220.25s -> 6221.05s]  It's going to be a deer.
[6223.66s -> 6224.94s]  22 miles per hour.
[6224.94s -> 6226.86s]  That would be very, that'd be a lot.
[6227.50s -> 6229.42s]  I don't see anything.
[6229.42s -> 6229.58s]  All right.
[6229.58s -> 6230.06s]  There he is.
[6230.06s -> 6230.22s]  Okay.
[6235.90s -> 6236.78s]  Am I close enough?
[6242.03s -> 6244.03s]  I'm going to have to do like a, is it bullet drop?
[6253.79s -> 6254.91s]  Aim for the head.
[6256.30s -> 6257.10s]  A swing.
[6257.98s -> 6266.00s]  Do I not go get the meat?
[6266.64s -> 6270.51s]  Hunt another deer.
[6270.51s -> 6270.75s]  Okay.
[6271.55s -> 6273.77s]  Well, we're going to, I want to get the meat here.
[6274.49s -> 6276.89s]  Select and call while aiming at it.
[6277.45s -> 6280.89s]  This will give you a chance of a clean kill as they raise their head before fleeing.
[6281.69s -> 6285.66s]  So there's one over here.
[6289.34s -> 6289.50s]  All right.
[6289.50s -> 6291.18s]  Well, I do have any luck.
[6292.14s -> 6299.50s]  I mean, we get the 21 stink meter up there.
[6304.51s -> 6304.83s]  Okay.
[6304.83s -> 6309.63s]  I haven't even played God of War, the new one for PS4, but I feel like this is the game.
[6309.63s -> 6311.23s]  Is that this happens in that game, right?
[6315.68s -> 6316.72s]  This is like the same game.
[6320.91s -> 6321.79s]  Something like that.
[6321.79s -> 6321.95s]  Yeah.
[6321.95s -> 6322.75s]  Which way is it going?
[6323.31s -> 6337.23s]  I mean, this, this is, is it going that way or to the left?
[6339.48s -> 6346.09s]  That I don't know the tracks.
[6346.09s -> 6347.21s]  I mean, those are tracks, right?
[6348.01s -> 6349.15s]  Or did I make those?
[6349.15s -> 6349.87s]  No, it's down here.
[6358.14s -> 6358.94s]  What's the button to call?
[6366.57s -> 6367.29s]  Fuck.
[6367.29s -> 6375.26s]  I don't even need to call them.
[6375.26s -> 6376.38s]  Why did I even call?
[6376.38s -> 6377.58s]  That was no reason for that.
[6381.15s -> 6383.31s]  I, I made these tracks.
[6391.55s -> 6391.87s]  Okay.
[6391.87s -> 6392.43s]  There he is.
[6402.20s -> 6403.98s]  Got it.
[6403.98s -> 6404.22s]  Okay.
[6404.22s -> 6405.10s]  We can stop this now.
[6405.66s -> 6406.06s]  Let's go.
[6416.41s -> 6418.17s]  Oh, it's actually pick up the whole thing.
[6418.97s -> 6421.12s]  This is realism.
[6421.76s -> 6426.99s]  The compendium tracks what you have discovered in the world.
[6426.99s -> 6429.39s]  It can be accessed from the progress section of the pause menu.
[6429.95s -> 6435.58s]  We found the realism.
[6436.14s -> 6441.24s]  You can increase the distance that the horse will respond.
[6442.04s -> 6444.36s]  Come on.
[6448.86s -> 6449.58s]  There he is.
[6451.29s -> 6453.05s]  Shoot the deer in the head.
[6453.85s -> 6455.77s]  I don't want to explode the team's head.
[6457.29s -> 6457.53s]  All right.
[6457.53s -> 6472.19s]  Let's go.
[6473.29s -> 6474.01s]  Yes, you do.
[6474.01s -> 6474.65s]  No, I don't.
[6475.29s -> 6476.73s]  I don't want to do it.
[6476.73s -> 6476.97s]  All right.
[6476.97s -> 6484.88s]  Meet up with Charles.
[6485.52s -> 6488.24s]  All right, Charlie.
[6488.24s -> 6488.88s]  I'm coming.
[6499.85s -> 6501.21s]  I want to see its brains.
[6501.21s -> 6501.61s]  Jesus.
[6502.01s -> 6502.41s]  Christ.
[6509.08s -> 6517.98s]  Uh, so you drop off carcasses to Pearson at the meat factory to contribute to gang supplies.
[6517.98s -> 6518.46s]  Okay.
[6518.46s -> 6520.14s]  I knew you'd be okay with that bow.
[6522.06s -> 6522.22s]  Okay.
[6522.22s -> 6523.34s]  You want to see the deer's balls?
[6523.34s -> 6524.46s]  Everyone's freaking out about it.
[6524.46s -> 6524.62s]  All right.
[6524.62s -> 6525.74s]  Let's look at the deer's balls.
[6526.70s -> 6527.82s]  The deer doesn't have any balls.
[6529.50s -> 6529.90s]  Right.
[6529.90s -> 6530.22s]  Never.
[6530.22s -> 6530.46s]  Okay.
[6531.58s -> 6533.15s]  That's not how it works.
[6533.15s -> 6542.20s]  You know, there are.
[6549.76s -> 6551.36s]  See, I told you they weren't going to be there.
[6560.67s -> 6561.71s]  I missed you guys.
[6561.71s -> 6562.35s]  I really did.
[6564.64s -> 6567.60s]  I like, I unequivocally missed all of you.
[6573.71s -> 6574.84s]  Eat.
[6574.84s -> 6578.83s]  We give the cab cook five minutes to grab the essentials and go.
[6579.47s -> 6582.75s]  And he doesn't even bring a crumb of food.
[6582.75s -> 6584.11s]  Good that we caught more than one.
[6584.75s -> 6588.43s]  We've only been up here a few days and have already picked up two more mouths to feed.
[6589.15s -> 6590.35s]  One more.
[6590.35s -> 6592.27s]  I bet German doesn't even know me.
[6593.95s -> 6594.35s]  Boy.
[6595.55s -> 6596.03s]  What's your name?
[6596.03s -> 6598.75s]  Karen Salt and awful Pearson was kind enough to give us.
[6600.73s -> 6602.57s]  She has a wild look in her eyes.
[6602.57s -> 6604.41s]  Of course.
[6605.45s -> 6606.65s]  She lost her husband.
[6606.65s -> 6608.57s]  Even me, the one that makes fun of you.
[6608.57s -> 6609.13s]  Even you.
[6609.93s -> 6610.57s]  Even you.
[6624.24s -> 6626.24s]  No, I'm not going to show the horse balls.
[6628.32s -> 6629.28s]  That's too easy.
[6630.96s -> 6633.36s]  I'm not going to shoot the horses balls with an arrow.
[6633.36s -> 6635.12s]  Like everybody wants me to do.
[6637.92s -> 6639.12s]  That's not going to happen.
[6650.32s -> 6651.12s]  No one said that.
[6651.12s -> 6651.68s]  Yes, they did.
[6657.60s -> 6658.40s]  Oh, shit.
[6658.40s -> 6658.80s]  Bears.
[6667.15s -> 6667.87s]  No, don't shoot him.
[6670.35s -> 6671.07s]  Am I losing?
[6671.07s -> 6671.95s]  What's wrong with my arms?
[6672.27s -> 6672.75s]  No, let it go.
[6672.75s -> 6673.07s]  Let go.
[6673.07s -> 6673.39s]  Let go.
[6673.39s -> 6673.71s]  Let go.
[6673.71s -> 6674.11s]  There you go.
[6686.01s -> 6687.29s]  You're going awfully fast.
[6693.28s -> 6694.24s]  Oh, the horses.
[6694.24s -> 6695.52s]  The horse is spooked.
[6695.52s -> 6695.84s]  Okay.
[6696.48s -> 6700.16s]  I'm going to hold L3 to make the horse not.
[6700.80s -> 6702.89s]  Can you see us?
[6705.32s -> 6706.12s]  Fight bear.
[6706.12s -> 6706.68s]  Fight bear.
[6707.56s -> 6714.16s]  Right in the fucking head.
[6721.07s -> 6721.95s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[6725.05s -> 6726.17s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6730.65s -> 6731.45s]  All right.
[6731.45s -> 6732.25s]  Cinematic mode.
[6737.80s -> 6738.84s]  He's screaming.
[6739.72s -> 6740.52s]  Where's my friend?
[6741.24s -> 6741.74s]  Come on.
[6741.74s -> 6742.06s]  Let's go.
[6742.06s -> 6742.46s]  Let's go.
[6742.46s -> 6743.34s]  Why is he standing there?
[6743.98s -> 6747.61s]  Is there a reason why he's just standing still up here?
[6755.29s -> 6755.93s]  The bear is gone.
[6756.49s -> 6757.48s]  Yeah, we're good.
[6762.57s -> 6763.45s]  I'm in combat.
[6763.45s -> 6764.09s]  No, I am not.
[6774.16s -> 6774.64s]  Let's go.
[6780.03s -> 6781.39s]  I have to fight the bear now.
[6781.95s -> 6796.04s]  Okay, I need to turn it off for a second.
[6796.04s -> 6796.44s]  Hold on.
[6796.44s -> 6797.00s]  Okay.
[6797.00s -> 6797.96s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[6797.96s -> 6798.68s]  Where's the bear?
[6806.60s -> 6808.27s]  Where's the bear?
[6808.27s -> 6809.15s]  I don't see a bear.
[6812.94s -> 6814.46s]  Give me the fucking carbine.
[6815.34s -> 6825.34s]  There's no bear.
[6826.44s -> 6827.16s]  He's not here.
[6827.80s -> 6832.68s]  Do you guys understand?
[6837.37s -> 6838.25s]  Do you see a bear?
[6848.96s -> 6849.76s]  I don't see a bear.
[6852.38s -> 6853.10s]  Wait, tracks.
[6856.01s -> 6856.65s]  Right there.
[6856.65s -> 6866.28s]  The fuck is he?
[6875.95s -> 6876.51s]  He's not here.
[6885.39s -> 6886.03s]  I see him.
[6888.32s -> 6888.88s]  No, you don't.
[6888.88s -> 6890.56s]  I mean, like, the red marker is over here.
[6894.12s -> 6895.64s]  Wouldn't it be over at the red marker?
[6896.36s -> 6899.88s]  I'm out of stamina.
[6899.88s -> 6900.36s]  I gotta eat.
[6900.36s -> 6901.16s]  Hold on.
[6901.16s -> 6903.52s]  Why did you guys make me do this?
[6904.24s -> 6906.30s]  I was so close to the end here.
[6910.65s -> 6911.85s]  Eat a can of beans.
[6911.85s -> 6920.78s]  Give me my horse.
[6923.05s -> 6924.81s]  You made you do this.
[6924.81s -> 6925.53s]  You did this.
[6926.65s -> 6929.82s]  There was never any bear?
[6932.92s -> 6933.80s]  Why do I hear it now?
[6934.44s -> 6940.54s]  Can we just leave?
[6941.34s -> 6942.22s]  We can leave.
[6942.22s -> 6942.62s]  Can't we?
[6943.42s -> 6945.90s]  He said, return to Charles.
[6945.90s -> 6946.46s]  I said, go.
[6946.46s -> 6947.34s]  Hurry up and return.
[6947.98s -> 6948.86s]  Where's my carcass?
[6949.74s -> 6953.05s]  Fucking carcass is on the ground over here.
[6953.05s -> 6953.93s]  That's what's happening.
[6953.93s -> 6954.33s]  I get it.
[6957.79s -> 6969.13s]  The horse is just as fucking stupid as I am.
[6972.22s -> 6973.90s]  All right, this is why I couldn't move.
[6973.90s -> 6975.42s]  It has nothing to do with the bear.
[6978.78s -> 6980.86s]  Just get back on the horse and let's go.
[6980.86s -> 6982.86s]  See, everyone told me it's because I was in combat.
[6982.86s -> 6984.54s]  This isn't World of Warcraft.
[6985.58s -> 6986.46s]  We can just leave.
[6992.62s -> 6993.26s]  All right, let's go.
[6999.15s -> 6999.63s]  Fuck.
[6999.63s -> 7020.22s]  Who is this fucking bear?
[7021.18s -> 7029.96s]  I soft-locked the game?
[7029.96s -> 7030.68s]  No, I didn't.
[7031.56s -> 7058.83s]  We're fine.
[7066.43s -> 7067.71s]  Shoot bear with arrow.
[7068.67s -> 7071.47s]  And my toddler brain was like, shoot bear with arrow.
[7071.47s -> 7073.47s]  Okay, I do think you say.
[7074.91s -> 7075.87s]  I'm a caveman.
[7076.83s -> 7079.37s]  Jerma, do that thing.
[7079.37s -> 7083.53s]  I do think me shoot arrow to bow to bear head.
[7093.63s -> 7094.43s]  Me shoot bear.
[7096.09s -> 7097.29s]  Chat say good idea.
[7115.84s -> 7116.40s]  We laugh.
[7117.12s -> 7120.96s]  We laugh at lowbrow joke.
[7122.84s -> 7149.20s]  Me stream on Twitch with bad internet.
[7153.76s -> 7160.19s]  Me try explain TCP IP to Bogo.
[7163.60s -> 7165.92s]  Bogo throw rock at head.
[7195.63s -> 7198.06s]  Well, it looks good.
[7199.66s -> 7202.14s]  I'm streaming at 6,000 right now.
[7203.10s -> 7207.15s]  I mean, when it's good, it looks great.
[7207.87s -> 7208.11s]  Right?
[7208.91s -> 7209.55s]  When it's bad.
[7214.62s -> 7225.52s]  The hell is calling me right now?
[7227.60s -> 7230.04s]  But I cannot answer that.
[7238.60s -> 7242.30s]  Thank you for showing me how to bow properly.
[7245.69s -> 7247.37s]  Takes a lifetime of practice to master.
[7251.08s -> 7251.40s]  Let's see.
[7254.20s -> 7255.24s]  So this upgrades.
[7255.88s -> 7258.12s]  Did they go a Fallout 4 route here?
[7259.24s -> 7261.40s]  Do I have to bring supplies and build stuff?
[7262.52s -> 7263.88s]  Just drop it down in here.
[7265.02s -> 7266.46s]  What a surprise.
[7266.46s -> 7269.02s]  Find a camp rat loitering around in the kitchen.
[7269.02s -> 7270.94s]  Is that any way to greet an old friend?
[7270.94s -> 7273.10s]  I feel like we haven't spoken for days.
[7273.10s -> 7275.26s]  I do my utmost to avoid you.
[7275.26s -> 7276.54s]  He loves me really.
[7276.54s -> 7277.98s]  It's his sad way of showing affection.
[7277.98s -> 7279.02s]  It's not forced, that's good.
[7279.02s -> 7280.30s]  No, it isn't.
[7280.30s -> 7281.42s]  Now shoot, get lost.
[7282.06s -> 7283.74s]  Well, see you gents later.
[7284.46s -> 7286.46s]  See, you got on just fine.
[7286.46s -> 7287.34s]  Charles is a wonder.
[7287.34s -> 7288.14s]  Have a drink, boys.
[7288.70s -> 7289.42s]  You earned it.
[7290.54s -> 7291.02s]  Have a drink.
[7291.02s -> 7291.74s]  It's urine.
[7291.74s -> 7293.42s]  Jesus, what is that?
[7293.42s -> 7294.70s]  Navy rum, sir.
[7294.70s -> 7295.74s]  It's the only thing.
[7295.74s -> 7296.54s]  The only thing.
[7297.82s -> 7299.10s]  Keeps you sane, it does.
[7299.10s -> 7301.74s]  Yeah, seems to have done a treat on you.
[7301.74s -> 7303.42s]  You go rest that hand, Charles.
[7303.42s -> 7304.78s]  I'll be fine in a few days.
[7304.78s -> 7307.34s]  You mind helping me with the skinning, Mr. Morgan?
[7307.34s -> 7308.62s]  It's easier if we do it together.
[7308.62s -> 7309.66s]  I'll get to skin you.
[7310.62s -> 7313.08s]  You're always one with the jokes, aren't you?
[7313.08s -> 7313.64s]  Come on.
[7313.64s -> 7316.20s]  This really isn't a job for a man with a burnt hand.
[7316.20s -> 7317.72s]  I'll see you both later.
[7317.72s -> 7324.20s]  See, that guy has the quintessential haircut of end of the plate of spaghetti.
[7325.40s -> 7326.84s]  Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, you can take this.
[7326.84s -> 7327.56s]  I'm done.
[7327.56s -> 7328.44s]  Are you sure you're done with that?
[7328.44s -> 7329.00s]  Yep, yep.
[7329.64s -> 7334.22s]  Arthur, come on, get that knife.
[7334.22s -> 7342.11s]  Just get him.
[7342.11s -> 7343.07s]  Now shoot the deer.
[7343.07s -> 7345.23s]  No, I'm not going to fuck up the tutorial missions.
[7345.79s -> 7347.39s]  That was very quick.
[7348.84s -> 7350.04s]  That's what it looks like in there?
[7350.60s -> 7351.64s]  Not too bad, Mr. Morgan.
[7351.64s -> 7357.79s]  I thought it was wires and components and shit.
[7357.79s -> 7358.75s]  It looks like that in there?
[7358.75s -> 7363.63s]  And pretty much any town, if you're looking to make a legitimate bit of money, of course.
[7364.35s -> 7366.19s]  I thought we just made animals.
[7366.19s -> 7367.07s]  They're like computers.
[7367.07s -> 7370.91s]  Well, if you catch anything else, sir, you bring it to me.
[7370.91s -> 7371.41s]  Sure.
[7372.43s -> 7373.79s]  Thank you, Mr. Morgan.
[7373.79s -> 7378.75s]  Heck, Arthur Morgan's first decent bit of hunting after all these years.
[7379.71s -> 7381.47s]  Well, we're on the run now.
[7381.47s -> 7383.63s]  Everyone's got to do their bit to survive.
[7383.63s -> 7384.59s]  You're not a Chuck E. Cheese.
[7384.59s -> 7385.47s]  It's like good stew.
[7385.47s -> 7386.19s]  The folk need it.
[7387.07s -> 7388.43s]  It's been a tough few days.
[7389.71s -> 7401.58s]  Few days later, you unlocked the master hunter challenge.
[7402.68s -> 7404.12s]  All right, tutorial complete.
[7404.12s -> 7411.26s]  It's been a bad few weeks, but Dutch, being Dutch, he is busy making plans and
[7412.22s -> 7416.54s]  Dutch being Dutch, those plans involve robbery and dreams.
[7419.31s -> 7419.95s]  Not yet, huh?
[7420.59s -> 7422.91s]  Who the hell is Epiticus?
[7422.91s -> 7425.63s]  I thought you was reading him his last rites.
[7425.63s -> 7429.15s]  Now I see you're introducing him to your other passion.
[7429.15s -> 7432.35s]  I'll mind you to show me some respect, Mr. Morgan.
[7432.35s -> 7433.71s]  Mind away, Reverend.
[7434.59s -> 7435.79s]  You're still here then?
[7437.36s -> 7437.92s]  I owe you.
[7439.58s -> 7440.46s]  And you'll pay me.
[7441.55s -> 7442.99s]  For the moment, just rest.
[7444.41s -> 7447.66s]  Arthur, I think it's time for the train.
[7448.22s -> 7449.10s]  Want me to come?
[7449.10s -> 7452.38s]  Of course I do, but look after it.
[7452.38s -> 7454.06s]  I was always ugly Dutch.
[7454.06s -> 7455.26s]  It's just a scratch.
[7455.26s -> 7456.62s]  Don't lie still, son.
[7457.26s -> 7458.06s]  What's that kid doing?
[7458.06s -> 7459.02s]  Get that kid out of here.
[7460.06s -> 7461.10s]  This is an M-rated game.
[7461.10s -> 7462.14s]  He's not allowed in here.
[7463.02s -> 7464.38s]  He's seen me now.
[7464.38s -> 7466.64s]  What's left of me?
[7466.64s -> 7468.67s]  What about you?
[7469.23s -> 7470.75s]  Guess I was hoping to see a corpse.
[7471.55s -> 7472.67s]  Bide your time.
[7472.67s -> 7473.95s]  You'll see plenty of them.
[7473.95s -> 7475.55s]  You're a rotten man, John Marsden.
[7475.55s -> 7477.31s]  He is an idiot, Abigail.
[7477.31s -> 7478.19s]  We all know it.
[7478.19s -> 7479.07s]  Fix the desync.
[7479.07s -> 7481.47s]  Now, railway men.
[7482.43s -> 7484.03s]  Tell me what happens here.
[7484.03s -> 7484.51s]  Ready?
[7484.51s -> 7485.47s]  At the water tower.
[7485.47s -> 7486.67s]  Just before the tunnel.
[7486.67s -> 7487.87s]  Ain't a problem.
[7487.87s -> 7489.39s]  Why are we doing this?
[7489.39s -> 7490.19s]  Weather's breaking.
[7490.19s -> 7490.83s]  We could leave.
[7490.83s -> 7492.51s]  I thought we was lying low.
[7493.79s -> 7495.39s]  What do you want from me, Hosea?
[7495.39s -> 7497.79s]  I just don't want any more folks to die, Dutch.
[7497.79s -> 7498.99s]  We're living, Hosea.
[7498.99s -> 7499.63s]  We're living.
[7499.63s -> 7500.51s]  Look at me.
[7500.51s -> 7501.31s]  We're living.
[7501.31s -> 7501.95s]  Even you.
[7502.51s -> 7504.11s]  But we need money.
[7504.11s -> 7506.11s]  Everything we have is in Blackwater.
[7506.11s -> 7506.51s]  Of course.
[7506.51s -> 7507.95s]  You fancy heading back there?
[7507.95s -> 7508.45s]  No.
[7509.31s -> 7510.38s]  Listen, Dutch.
[7510.38s -> 7511.74s]  I ain't trying to undermine you.
[7511.74s -> 7512.54s]  I just...
[7512.54s -> 7513.18s]  Okay.
[7513.18s -> 7516.94s]  I just want to stick to the plan, which was to lie low, then head back out west.
[7517.58s -> 7520.14s]  Now, suddenly we're about to rob a train.
[7520.14s -> 7520.78s]  Now it's too fast.
[7520.78s -> 7522.22s]  What choice have we got?
[7522.86s -> 7524.14s]  The Viticus Cornwalls.
[7524.14s -> 7525.34s]  No joke, Dutchie.
[7525.34s -> 7527.26s]  Who is the Viticus Cornwall?
[7527.26s -> 7527.82s]  Can I fix it?
[7527.82s -> 7531.58s]  He's a big railway magnet, sugar dealer, oil man.
[7531.58s -> 7533.10s]  Well, how good for him.
[7533.10s -> 7535.74s]  Sounds like he has more than enough to share.
[7535.74s -> 7536.30s]  Dutch.
[7536.30s -> 7541.50s]  Gentlemen, it is time to make something of ourselves.
[7541.50s -> 7542.94s]  Get your horses ready.
[7543.50s -> 7544.86s]  We have a train to rob.
[7544.86s -> 7545.36s]  Better?
[7559.87s -> 7560.37s]  Bad.
[7560.37s -> 7560.87s]  Bad.
[7567.24s -> 7568.20s]  Everything's weird?
[7568.84s -> 7569.48s]  No, it's not.
[7570.52s -> 7577.15s]  We're riding with the gang.
[7577.15s -> 7577.71s]  All right.
[7577.71s -> 7578.59s]  We're riding with the gang.
[7585.47s -> 7586.91s]  The street smells like pee now.
[7589.39s -> 7596.09s]  I'm gonna get hit by this train, I guarantee it.
[7599.00s -> 7600.68s]  Why is the audio playing backwards?
[7601.40s -> 7601.88s]  You know what?
[7603.00s -> 7603.48s]  You know what?
[7604.91s -> 7606.27s]  Don't you be coming back here now.
[7606.91s -> 7612.24s]  I don't know why that just popped in my head.
[7612.24s -> 7614.56s]  That's when you go to jail in the Monopoly game for Super Nintendo.
[7617.20s -> 7617.76s]  I don't know.
[7617.76s -> 7618.40s]  That just popped in.
[7619.04s -> 7620.08s]  It just popped in saying hello.
[7620.08s -> 7620.48s]  I don't know why.
[7628.96s -> 7629.82s]  It just popped in.
[7629.82s -> 7630.54s]  You know, it just popped in.
[7638.20s -> 7639.16s]  I wasn't paying attention.
[7642.38s -> 7643.42s]  God damn it.
[7643.98s -> 7644.30s]  All right.
[7644.30s -> 7645.02s]  Rob the train.
[7645.02s -> 7645.90s]  That's all I need to know.
[7646.54s -> 7658.86s]  So what's the story about?
[7658.86s -> 7670.22s]  Group of bandits, setting up camp, getting deer, and fending off other bandits so far.
[7670.94s -> 7672.38s]  And John Marston.
[7672.38s -> 7673.02s]  Oh, he did?
[7673.02s -> 7673.58s]  He didn't die?
[7674.30s -> 7677.07s]  Oh, that's a close one.
[7685.00s -> 7685.80s]  Well, this is pretty.
[7690.41s -> 7691.45s]  Did we go to like zero?
[7692.33s -> 7693.44s]  What's that right over here?
[7711.63s -> 7715.15s]  Well, I was under the assumption that I was hopefully going to be live for at least a couple hours.
[7716.11s -> 7716.75s]  Let's hope it's safe.
[7722.99s -> 7723.39s]  Holy shit.
