[0.00s -> 5.11s]  Here we go. If this doesn't work, then I am gonna quit streaming.
[5.11s -> 16.63s]  So it has to work. You know what I'm saying?
[16.63s -> 24.37s]  Here we go. Please work, please work, please work, please work, please work, please work!
[24.37s -> 33.13s]  Capture the whole thing. Why is- oh my god, I'm gonna fucking pee my pants on camera, I swear to god.
[33.13s -> 49.36s]  Oh my fucking god, I hate computers. You gotta be shitting me.
[49.36s -> 61.90s]  I can't play it in that fucking shitty little window, guys.
[61.90s -> 67.38s]  And I can't even fix it, because I have to-
[67.78s -> 73.65s]  Nice resolution. I'm just installing another one.
[73.65s -> 78.87s]  I can't believe that people are still here watching this mess.
[78.87s -> 82.84s]  Nancy Drew's Secrets Can Kill.
[82.84s -> 83.84s]  Install it.
[83.84s -> 106.78s]  Hi. If this doesn't work, I'm just gonna go to DOS.
[106.78s -> 114.63s]  You look like a ghoul?
[114.63s -> 127.66s]  I was about to just do a fucking ghoul scream into the camera. Like, right into the camera.
[127.66s -> 132.66s]  Alright, Nancy Drew's Secrets Can Kill. Sure, yes. Just steam client, strap in, whatever it's called.
[132.66s -> 146.26s]  Alright, is this one gonna get captured?
[146.66s -> 149.66s]  It's- this is the same thing as the last one.
[149.66s -> 166.58s]  Why is Secrets of the Old Clock captureable now?
[167.58s -> 182.62s]  The game fucking crashed.
[183.62s -> 191.47s]  Hi, I'm Nancy Drew. This is my center of operations, my desk.
[191.47s -> 193.47s]  Go ahead and poke around.
[193.47s -> 197.47s]  If you want to know the particulars of how I do what I do, take a look at the-
[198.47s -> 211.25s]  What? It's there, it's there, it's there, it's there!
[211.65s -> 212.65s]  ... how to be a detective.
[212.65s -> 217.27s]  It's real helpful, especially if you're new to the mystery-solving-
[217.27s -> 218.27s]  Shut up.
[218.27s -> 219.27s]  Excuse-
[219.27s -> 220.27s]  What?
[220.27s -> 221.27s]  Excuse me, giant hu-
[221.27s -> 222.27s]  Excuse-
[222.27s -> 226.51s]  Excuse me, giant human person, but you seem to-
[226.51s -> 227.51s]  ... business.
[227.51s -> 229.51s]  And be sure to check out my scrapbook.
[229.51s -> 232.51s]  I put memorabilia from all my past cases in there.
[232.51s -> 233.51s]  Killing-
[233.51s -> 234.51s]  Killing the old clock?
[234.51s -> 236.51s]  And at times, really scary.
[236.51s -> 238.51s]  But don't say anything about that to my dad, okay?
[238.51s -> 240.51s]  Nancy Drew's Secrets Can Kill.
[240.91s -> 244.91s]  And whatever you do, read what's in the file called Case File.
[244.91s -> 247.91s]  That'll tell you all about the mystery I'm about to try to solve.
[247.91s -> 250.91s]  If you think you're ready to dive into that mystery,
[250.91s -> 252.91s]  just click on the plane ticket and you'll be on your way.
[252.91s -> 254.91s]  Alright, Case File, let's see.
[254.91s -> 259.91s]  Curse, I gotta change this to be what the actual thing's actually called.
[259.91s -> 261.91s]  Secrets Can Kill?
[261.91s -> 266.86s]  Alright, it's alright if I'm having you sit there for like 15 straight minutes
[266.86s -> 269.93s]  of like a black screen.
[270.33s -> 285.60s]  Let me just change the stream info to Secrets Can Kill.
[285.60s -> 288.60s]  A student named Jake Rogers was killed at a high school last week.
[288.60s -> 289.60s]  What?
[289.60s -> 293.60s]  An undercover detective by the name of Beach asked Aunt Eloise-
[293.60s -> 297.60s]  Eloise if I could go undercover to investigate the murder.
[297.60s -> 300.60s]  I'm posing as a new student to see what the other kids may know about Jake
[300.60s -> 302.60s]  and his untimely aunt.
[302.60s -> 306.44s]  I'm posing as a new student?
[306.44s -> 314.38s]  Wait, how old am I?
[314.38s -> 327.24s]  Check out How to Be a Detective.
[327.24s -> 341.70s]  How do I close the book?
[342.10s -> 344.98s]  What the fuck, man?
[354.15s -> 355.15s]  Shut up!
[355.15s -> 357.97s]  Okay, give me the plane ticket.
[357.97s -> 358.97s]  Put down the book.
[358.97s -> 360.97s]  Put the book down.
[360.97s -> 361.97s]  Put the book down, Nancy.
[361.97s -> 362.97s]  Put the book down.
[362.97s -> 368.41s]  How do I put down the book?
[368.41s -> 375.51s]  Oh my god.
[387.51s -> 389.51s]  The police detective wants me to pose as a student
[389.51s -> 391.51s]  to search for any leads at the school.
[391.51s -> 393.51s]  So, it's undercover I go.
[393.51s -> 396.51s]  I'm calling this case, Secrets Can Kill.
[396.51s -> 398.51s]  Love, Nancy.
[398.51s -> 406.07s]  Alright.
[406.07s -> 408.07s]  Nancy, I had to close the school library early today
[408.07s -> 410.07s]  but if you need to do any research for your case
[410.07s -> 412.07s]  the key to the library is in the safe.
[412.07s -> 414.31s]  Remember not to enter in a wrong combination.
[414.31s -> 419.37s]  Why is that underlined?
[419.37s -> 421.37s]  Is it going to like explode?
[421.37s -> 423.37s]  Why would you write that?
[423.37s -> 433.42s]  Six zero KS.
[433.82s -> 435.82s]  Raseo del Mar universe in the...
[435.82s -> 437.82s]  Is this my diploma?
[437.82s -> 440.57s]  Why would I have my diploma folded up into a drawer?
[440.57s -> 442.57s]  Don't you put that shit on the back of your wall.
[442.57s -> 458.70s]  Oh, what was it?
[458.70s -> 460.70s]  Six O-K-S, right?
[460.70s -> 468.12s]  That's not correct?
[468.12s -> 472.98s]  Six O-K-S.
[474.98s -> 498.82s]  Ooh, a key.
[498.82s -> 516.49s]  I got it.
[516.49s -> 521.22s]  What is going on here?
[521.22s -> 523.22s]  That's incorrect.
[523.22s -> 536.66s]  It's got to be...
[536.66s -> 538.66s]  This has got to come down.
[538.66s -> 557.48s]  Is this all the way to the little...
[557.48s -> 559.78s]  This is the top right corner.
[559.78s -> 577.56s]  Alright, so this is...
[577.56s -> 579.56s]  I'm getting there.
[579.56s -> 593.37s]  This is her face, right?
[593.37s -> 604.68s]  Hold on. Is it going to come down?
[604.68s -> 608.78s]  Now, I hate these types of puzzles.
[608.78s -> 610.78s]  Yeah, they're...
[610.78s -> 612.78s]  I'm keeping it together.
[612.78s -> 639.59s]  Alright, alright.
[639.59s -> 643.62s]  Now, I've got to get this.
[643.62s -> 646.70s]  I'm going to have an aneurysm by this.
[646.70s -> 685.02s]  You're fine. That goes up here.
[685.02s -> 687.02s]  I'm so close, but so far away at the same time.
[687.02s -> 693.67s]  Where is... This goes to the left.
[693.67s -> 722.98s]  Motherfucker, it's right there.
[722.98s -> 736.04s]  Alright.
[736.04s -> 738.04s]  Come on.
[738.04s -> 740.04s]  So close.
[740.04s -> 771.06s]  I can fix this shit later.
[771.06s -> 774.71s]  You have to be done.
[774.71s -> 776.71s]  Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[776.71s -> 780.30s]  He's not a senior detective.
[780.30s -> 783.69s]  I'm fine. I have to get this shit over here.
[783.69s -> 828.79s]  What?
[828.79s -> 830.79s]  I'm almost there, guys.
[830.79s -> 869.38s]  I have it. I'm almost done.
[869.38s -> 871.38s]  I...
[871.38s -> 873.38s]  One guy that said, I hate these things.
[873.38s -> 875.38s]  They are the worst.
[875.38s -> 878.20s]  They really are the fucking worst.
[878.20s -> 888.38s]  I hate them.
[888.38s -> 890.38s]  It's so close. It's almost here.
[890.38s -> 893.58s]  It's ready, but they need to be moved.
[942.78s -> 978.49s]  I just had it, and I fucked it up.
[978.49s -> 982.90s]  I know it's easy, but
[982.90s -> 984.90s]  I'm fucking so done.
[984.90s -> 989.83s]  I'm trying
[989.83s -> 1000.20s]  to solve it.
[1000.20s -> 1002.20s]  I'm about to just hold the power button on my computer.
[1002.20s -> 1004.20s]  I'm about to hold the power button on the computer.
[1004.20s -> 1006.20s]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[1006.20s -> 1032.62s]  I'm about to hold the power button.
[1032.62s -> 1059.24s]  This needs to be up here.
[1059.24s -> 1061.74s]  I know.
[1061.74s -> 1063.74s]  Look, it's like the streamer
[1063.74s -> 1065.74s]  curse, okay?
[1065.74s -> 1067.74s]  If I was lying in bed doing this, I could probably do this in
[1067.74s -> 1112.79s]  five seconds.
[1112.79s -> 1120.02s]  I was seconds away from holding down
[1120.02s -> 1125.53s]  the power button, I promise.
[1125.53s -> 1127.53s]  Okay, login name. Alois Drew, password
[1127.53s -> 1129.53s]  Owise Elder, school computer.
[1129.53s -> 1143.08s]  Okay, got it.
[1143.08s -> 1145.32s]  Pain in the ass that was.
[1145.32s -> 1149.10s]  Alright, let's go.
[1149.10s -> 1151.10s]  This is kind of freaking me out.
[1178.20s -> 1180.20s]  This is kind of freaking me out.
[1180.20s -> 1182.20s]  This is kind of freaking me out.
[1182.20s -> 1184.20s]  So I'm pretending to be
[1184.20s -> 1186.20s]  a high schooler
[1186.20s -> 1188.20s]  and this guy's pretending to be my uncle.
[1211.21s -> 1213.21s]  Students, too.
[1221.21s -> 1223.21s]  The high school.
[1233.21s -> 1235.21s]  Is he pretending to be a student, too?
[1237.21s -> 1239.21s]  We're all pretending to be students?
[1239.21s -> 1241.21s]  We're all just detectives?
[1241.21s -> 1243.21s]  Wait, what?
[1264.79s -> 1266.79s]  That's me, right?
[1268.79s -> 1270.79s]  And I'm pretending?
[1272.79s -> 1274.79s]  I can't. I don't know you have contacts.
[1274.79s -> 1278.82s]  That's something I didn't have.
[1278.82s -> 1280.82s]  That's not part of my job.
[1297.35s -> 1299.35s]  What?
[1299.35s -> 1303.51s]  I can't play Barnacle Blast? Are you serious?
[1303.51s -> 1305.51s]  That's a shame.
[1305.51s -> 1319.70s]  That makes a cool sound.
[1319.70s -> 1321.70s]  Alright, let's find our uncle
[1321.70s -> 1327.53s]  who's hanging out somewhere in the diner.
[1331.53s -> 1333.53s]  Oh, hey Jimmy!
[1349.53s -> 1351.53s]  He's a pulling dynamite character.
[1353.53s -> 1355.53s]  Of course. I'm just a bit...
[1355.53s -> 1357.53s]  Well, my undercover assignments
[1357.53s -> 1359.53s]  are usually not so...
[1359.53s -> 1361.53s]  suburban.
[1361.53s -> 1363.53s]  I understand.
[1363.53s -> 1365.53s]  The victim was a senior named Jake Rogers.
[1365.53s -> 1367.53s]  As usual, none of the family, teachers or students
[1367.53s -> 1369.53s]  know about any enemies he may have had.
[1369.53s -> 1371.53s]  Nothing came up from searching
[1371.53s -> 1373.53s]  his home, computer, cell phone or locker.
[1373.53s -> 1375.53s]  His bank records tell a different story.
[1375.53s -> 1377.53s]  Bank records?
[1377.53s -> 1379.53s]  He had a fairly large savings account and a lot of cash deposits.
[1379.53s -> 1381.53s]  We suspect he was involved in
[1381.53s -> 1383.53s]  something shady.
[1383.53s -> 1385.53s]  Drugs, gambling or blackmail.
[1385.53s -> 1387.53s]  That's where you fit in.
[1387.53s -> 1389.53s]  Talk to the students and see what you can find out.
[1389.53s -> 1391.53s]  We think he might have kept information about
[1391.53s -> 1393.53s]  his activities in a notebook or journal.
[1393.53s -> 1395.53s]  So keep a lookout for anything like that.
[1395.53s -> 1397.53s]  Anything else?
[1397.53s -> 1399.53s]  Bye Uncle Steve.
[1399.53s -> 1401.70s]  Goodbye Nancy.
[1401.70s -> 1403.70s]  Okay. Any food on the table?
[1403.70s -> 1405.70s]  Anything I can grab? Any slide puzzles
[1405.70s -> 1407.70s]  for me to almost turn my computer off?
[1407.70s -> 1409.70s]  I ripped the plug out of the wall.
[1409.70s -> 1412.26s]  I'm looking for another slide puzzle.
[1412.26s -> 1415.70s]  What about here?
[1415.70s -> 1421.02s]  This is my house.
[1421.02s -> 1433.05s]  Okay. Homecoming.
[1433.05s -> 1436.95s]  I thought this was a golf club.
[1436.95s -> 1438.95s]  Surf club is cool. That's cool.
[1438.95s -> 1447.96s]  Is this the locker?
[1447.96s -> 1449.96s]  Alright. I don't know this information yet.
[1449.96s -> 1456.62s]  Alright. Is this the gym?
[1456.62s -> 1459.24s]  Homecoming.
[1459.24s -> 1464.94s]  A note.
[1464.94s -> 1466.94s]  Message. KRL.
[1466.94s -> 1468.94s]  Sneeze and vid.
[1468.94s -> 1470.94s]  Unroy.
[1470.94s -> 1473.62s]  Alright. What is that for?
[1473.62s -> 1489.50s]  Okay. For a second I thought that their mascot
[1489.50s -> 1491.50s]  was a sock.
[1491.50s -> 1493.86s]  With boxing gloves.
[1493.86s -> 1495.86s]  What a dumb mascot.
[1495.86s -> 1506.87s]  Extra pop. Grape. Orange.
[1506.87s -> 1508.87s]  Soda. Cool.
[1508.87s -> 1512.39s]  Or spot cola.
[1512.39s -> 1514.39s]  I would love to have a sip of cool cola.
[1514.39s -> 1518.30s]  Soda pop?
[1518.30s -> 1520.30s]  This is probably a puzzle.
[1520.30s -> 1522.30s]  Spot cola. Cool soda.
[1522.30s -> 1524.30s]  Orange soda.
[1524.30s -> 1527.05s]  Grape soda.
[1527.05s -> 1529.05s]  Grape. Orange. Cool. Soda.
[1529.05s -> 1531.05s]  No.
[1531.05s -> 1533.05s]  I need money.
[1533.05s -> 1537.59s]  Out of order?
[1537.59s -> 1540.79s]  Why do you think it costs money?
[1540.79s -> 1542.79s]  Holy shit. You just kind of stand.
[1550.79s -> 1553.99s]  The Hulk?
[1561.99s -> 1563.99s]  And then the pros.
[1563.99s -> 1566.81s]  Showtime.
[1566.81s -> 1568.81s]  Who are the manatees?
[1568.81s -> 1570.81s]  Paseo Del Mar's mascot is a manatee.
[1570.81s -> 1572.81s]  Don't tell me you're afraid of a little sea cow.
[1572.81s -> 1574.81s]  Of course not. I know what to do if I come across
[1574.81s -> 1576.81s]  a manatee. Why would you immediately
[1576.81s -> 1578.81s]  talk about how you would fight and punch one
[1578.81s -> 1581.69s]  and hurt one?
[1581.69s -> 1583.69s]  Of course not. I know what to do if I come across
[1583.69s -> 1585.69s]  a manatee.
[1585.69s -> 1587.69s]  Yeah. Just sneeze and it'll swim away.
[1587.69s -> 1589.69s]  Seriously. The manatees are a great team
[1589.69s -> 1591.69s]  at a great school.
[1591.69s -> 1593.69s]  This school is cool. Except for a few punks like
[1593.69s -> 1595.69s]  Jake Rogers.
[1595.69s -> 1597.69s]  Jake Rogers?
[1597.69s -> 1599.69s]  I knew Jake, but I didn't hang out with him.
[1599.69s -> 1601.69s]  Is it the guy that died?
[1601.69s -> 1603.69s]  Sorry. Can't talk now. I gotta go to practice.
[1603.69s -> 1613.53s]  Later.
[1613.53s -> 1615.53s]  You name dropped the only person
[1615.53s -> 1619.88s]  who died.
[1619.88s -> 1621.88s]  Yeah. This school is pretty cool. Except Jake
[1621.88s -> 1624.12s]  Robert. Jake Robert sucks. I hate him.
[1624.12s -> 1626.12s]  Oh. Okay. You know, he's dead.
[1626.12s -> 1629.05s]  Oh. Yeah.
[1629.05s -> 1634.60s]  Welcome to the school.
[1634.60s -> 1636.60s]  How could I get into Jake's locker?
[1636.60s -> 1638.60s]  I could tear the door off with my teeth.
[1638.60s -> 1640.60s]  But it just might be easier to ask
[1640.60s -> 1642.60s]  Hal Tanaka. His locker was right next to
[1642.60s -> 1645.03s]  Jake's. Okay.
[1645.03s -> 1647.03s]  What can you tell me about Daryl Gray?
[1647.03s -> 1649.03s]  He seems like a cool guy.
[1649.03s -> 1651.03s]  His family used to sponsor the annual football
[1651.03s -> 1653.03s]  awards dinner until last year.
[1653.03s -> 1655.03s]  You know, he's the one who found Jake's body.
[1655.03s -> 1658.81s]  Wait. What?
[1658.81s -> 1660.81s]  Hold on. I'm so
[1660.81s -> 1664.14s]  lost right now.
[1664.14s -> 1666.14s]  He knows, he knows that he's
[1666.14s -> 1668.14s]  that this
[1668.14s -> 1670.14s]  this guy's dead.
[1670.14s -> 1672.14s]  He talked about how much he's like
[1672.14s -> 1674.50s]  he sucks. And now he's like, oh
[1674.50s -> 1676.50s]  yeah. That's where the body was.
[1676.50s -> 1682.46s]  I'll talk to you later.
[1682.46s -> 1684.46s]  That's a psycho. Financing. Yeah. This is a psychopath.
[1684.46s -> 1687.40s]  You like checked every
[1687.40s -> 1689.40s]  box of are you a psychopath
[1689.40s -> 1692.34s]  or not? Alright. We gotta find, where's this
[1692.34s -> 1696.81s]  in the trash?
[1696.81s -> 1699.69s]  Eye test. E-V-I'll do
[1699.69s -> 1707.82s]  it. I'll do the eye test. Let's see
[1707.82s -> 1724.71s]  how good I do. E-V-I
[1724.71s -> 1726.71s]  F-O-R
[1726.71s -> 1729.08s]  E-Z-E-E
[1729.08s -> 1731.08s]  R-H-T
[1731.08s -> 1733.08s]  E-G
[1733.08s -> 1735.08s]  A-P-K
[1735.08s -> 1737.08s]  O-O-B-Y
[1737.08s -> 1741.03s]  R-T
[1741.03s -> 1743.03s]  C-Z-M
[1743.03s -> 1745.03s]  N-M-C-Z-M
[1745.03s -> 1748.30s]  N-J
[1748.30s -> 1750.30s]  K-O
[1750.30s -> 1752.30s]  O-L-K-M
[1752.30s -> 1754.30s]  O-T-E-M
[1754.30s -> 1759.80s]  I don't know.
[1759.80s -> 1761.80s]  B-F-F-A
[1761.80s -> 1763.80s]  L-E-E
[1763.80s -> 1765.80s]  U-L-K-Y
[1765.80s -> 1768.62s]  K-A-A
[1768.62s -> 1776.94s]  P-I
[1776.94s -> 1782.25s]  Go to the doctor. No, I
[1782.25s -> 1784.87s]  can't do this. You know, okay,
[1784.87s -> 1786.87s]  when you go, okay, Jeremy, please
[1786.87s -> 1788.87s]  cover one eye and do it. And you cover one eye and you do it
[1788.87s -> 1790.87s]  and then it's like, oh, do the other eye. And it's like
[1790.87s -> 1793.50s]  I can't. It's all blurry.
[1793.50s -> 1797.85s]  You can only do this once. You actually
[1797.85s -> 1799.85s]  can only do that test one time. You can't do the other eye.
[1799.85s -> 1801.85s]  Because my eye, the other eye is like all
[1801.85s -> 1805.62s]  fucked up and blurry and shit.
[1805.62s -> 1808.70s]  You got about half of that wrong.
[1808.70s -> 1815.03s]  Well, maybe down by the bottom. Don't
[1815.03s -> 1817.03s]  press it. No, it's the
[1817.03s -> 1819.03s]  it's the light coming back into your eye.
[1819.03s -> 1821.03s]  It's like all blurry and smushed.
[1821.03s -> 1823.03s]  Go to a doctor. What are you talking
[1823.03s -> 1830.14s]  about? Go to a doctor.
[1830.14s -> 1832.14s]  What are you talking about? I'm fine.
[1832.14s -> 1837.88s]  Alright. Please go to a doctor
[1837.88s -> 1839.88s]  that shouldn't happen. What are you, what?
[1839.88s -> 1843.21s]  When I cover one eye
[1843.21s -> 1845.21s]  and then I do, I cover one eye for long
[1845.21s -> 1847.21s]  enough and I take my hand off that eye and I cover
[1847.21s -> 1849.21s]  it. It's like this eye that was covered
[1849.21s -> 1851.90s]  is all fucked up.
[1851.90s -> 1853.90s]  Bro, don't you have a hernia? Yeah.
[1853.90s -> 1862.90s]  It sucks. Okay, I found a coin.
[1862.90s -> 1872.06s]  Let's go get a drink. The drink is not
[1872.06s -> 1878.90s]  in the women's bathroom. How do I get
[1878.90s -> 1880.90s]  the hell out of here? Alright, drink.
[1880.90s -> 1882.90s]  Uh, I want a
[1882.90s -> 1884.90s]  what should I get? Cool soda?
[1884.90s -> 1888.81s]  Or should I get extra pop? I think, yeah,
[1888.81s -> 1890.81s]  cool soda. Definitely.
[1898.47s -> 1900.47s]  That is wasted quarter.
[1900.47s -> 1905.02s]  Alright, we're gonna go talk to this
[1905.02s -> 1907.02s]  whoever was the locker?
[1907.02s -> 1913.35s]  Where would I find this person?
[1913.35s -> 1916.36s]  Learning is the only thing the mind never
[1916.36s -> 1918.36s]  exhausts, never fears, and never regrets.
[1918.36s -> 1920.36s]  Da Vinci.
[1920.36s -> 1933.54s]  Thank you, Da Vinci. Very nice.
[1933.54s -> 1935.54s]  Yes. Thank you, Da Vinci.
[1935.54s -> 1940.34s]  Danger. Admit to authorize
[1940.34s -> 1942.34s]  personnel only. What do you mean danger?
[1942.34s -> 1949.06s]  This is like a high voltage room back here?
[1949.06s -> 1951.06s]  Alright, hold on. This is a puzzle?
[1951.06s -> 1960.20s]  Oh, I don't know the code.
[1960.20s -> 1965.13s]  Alright, I remember that's here.
[1965.13s -> 1967.62s]  Okay. Hi, I'm Connie.
[1967.62s -> 1969.62s]  You're not from around here, are you?
[1969.62s -> 1971.62s]  Usually, Paseo Del Mar High is
[1971.62s -> 1973.62s]  really quiet and boring. Connie, where'd you get that?
[1973.62s -> 1975.62s]  Lately, it's been totally out of control.
[1975.62s -> 1978.31s]  I want one of those.
[1978.31s -> 1980.31s]  Where do I get this? They don't have that here.
[1980.31s -> 1982.31s]  They don't sell that here. You brought that in from home.
[1982.31s -> 1984.31s]  No outside food or drink
[1984.31s -> 1986.31s]  allowed. I'm reporting you to the hall monitor.
[1986.31s -> 1991.05s]  Out of control?
[1991.05s -> 1993.05s]  One of the students was
[1993.05s -> 1997.02s]  killed last week. Who
[1997.02s -> 1999.02s]  was killed? Oh, just this
[1999.02s -> 2001.02s]  wannabe stud named Jake Rogers.
[2001.02s -> 2003.02s]  Why are people shit talking?
[2003.02s -> 2005.02s]  Jake Rogers was a total creep.
[2005.02s -> 2007.02s]  Nobody liked him. I gotta go
[2007.02s -> 2011.05s]  now. Later. Oh my
[2011.05s -> 2016.10s]  God. Didn't he just
[2016.10s -> 2018.10s]  get thrown down a flight of stairs
[2018.10s -> 2020.10s]  and died?
[2020.10s -> 2022.10s]  Hey Nancy, need something?
[2022.10s -> 2024.10s]  What do you know about Hulk
[2024.10s -> 2026.10s]  Sanchez? He's a big jock on
[2026.10s -> 2028.10s]  campus. Never dated him or anything.
[2028.10s -> 2030.10s]  Why do we need that info? Why do you
[2030.10s -> 2032.79s]  have to say that? I don't
[2032.79s -> 2034.79s]  need that info.
[2034.79s -> 2036.79s]  Hey, who is this person? Oh, you know, he's a jock.
[2036.79s -> 2038.79s]  I never dated him though.
[2038.79s -> 2041.16s]  Alright.
[2041.16s -> 2043.98s]  Okay. I just asked
[2043.98s -> 2048.39s]  you who he was. How well do you
[2048.39s -> 2050.39s]  know Daryl Gray?
[2050.39s -> 2052.39s]  They both did it.
[2052.39s -> 2054.39s]  He's the only guy I'd ever consider dating.
[2054.39s -> 2056.39s]  He's student council president,
[2056.39s -> 2058.39s]  holds a cool job at a diner called Max scenes,
[2058.39s -> 2060.39s]  and drives a CBAC X8.
[2060.39s -> 2062.39s]  You're really hammering down the like, who I'm going to date.
[2062.39s -> 2064.39s]  Drives a sports car and works at a diner?
[2064.39s -> 2066.39s]  That doesn't compute.
[2066.39s -> 2068.39s]  Yeah, I don't get it either. Daryl's family
[2068.39s -> 2070.39s]  was rich and used to throw major parties all the time.
[2070.39s -> 2073.66s]  But not anymore.
[2073.66s -> 2076.15s]  What is that? I'll talk to you
[2076.15s -> 2078.15s]  later. Bye Nancy.
[2078.15s -> 2080.52s]  What is that on her neck? Is it like a medal?
[2080.52s -> 2082.52s]  Is it like a gold medal? What is that?
[2082.52s -> 2084.52s]  Hey Nancy, need something?
[2084.52s -> 2086.52s]  See you later.
[2086.52s -> 2088.52s]  Bye Nancy. It's an Olympic medal.
[2088.52s -> 2096.20s]  Is it? Magazine
[2096.20s -> 2103.11s]  puzzle? Connie the Olympian.
[2103.11s -> 2108.30s]  Paseo students of the month.
[2108.30s -> 2111.69s]  Why is this like
[2111.69s -> 2114.06s]  this? Somebody did
[2114.06s -> 2116.06s]  this wrong.
[2116.06s -> 2118.06s]  September, October, November, December, January,
[2118.06s -> 2120.06s]  February, March. Why wouldn't this be in a row?
[2120.06s -> 2123.83s]  It's weird
[2123.83s -> 2128.89s]  in a row. It's a school year.
[2128.89s -> 2130.89s]  Look at the chat. Look at the chat. Look at the chat.
[2130.89s -> 2133.64s]  Look at the chat. Is this a puzzle?
[2133.64s -> 2140.94s]  What do you want? Alright, that's
[2140.94s -> 2145.42s]  What do you even get that image from?
[2145.42s -> 2147.42s]  Alright, so maybe I need to remember
[2147.42s -> 2151.90s]  this. Alright, well we know that now.
[2151.90s -> 2153.90s]  Let's go in here.
[2153.90s -> 2155.90s]  I'm going in. I'm old enough
[2155.90s -> 2157.90s]  to go in here. I'm like 37.
[2157.90s -> 2159.90s]  You're not supposed to go in there.
[2159.90s -> 2163.42s]  Sorry, blew my cover.
[2163.42s -> 2169.62s]  That was a shiny thing.
[2169.62s -> 2182.04s]  Oh, a quarter. Am I going to softlock
[2182.04s -> 2191.96s]  myself? She did it.
[2191.96s -> 2193.96s]  I didn't do it. She did.
[2193.96s -> 2203.35s]  She did it. Oh, a quarter.
[2203.35s -> 2213.98s]  That's some.
[2213.98s -> 2216.22s]  Can I nominate
[2216.22s -> 2222.68s]  that? Oh,
[2222.68s -> 2227.16s]  another quarter. No, I might
[2227.16s -> 2232.22s]  need this. Alright, I have to find this
[2232.22s -> 2242.07s]  student. Debate
[2242.07s -> 2244.57s]  team, math team.
[2244.57s -> 2251.10s]  Hi, my name's Nancy
[2251.10s -> 2253.10s]  Drew. What's your name?
[2253.10s -> 2255.10s]  Hal Tanaka. Actually, my first
[2255.10s -> 2257.10s]  name is much longer than that.
[2257.10s -> 2259.10s]  But I want to fit in here in America.
[2259.10s -> 2261.10s]  So I chose Hal as my nickname.
[2261.10s -> 2263.10s]  I'm a Japanese exchange
[2263.10s -> 2265.10s]  student. Why do you think it's
[2265.10s -> 2267.27s]  easier to have an American name?
[2267.27s -> 2269.27s]  I want to be part of the culture and
[2269.27s -> 2274.33s]  succeed in this country.
[2274.33s -> 2276.33s]  Do you plan on staying in America after
[2276.33s -> 2278.33s]  you finish high school? My family
[2278.33s -> 2280.33s]  is counting on me to succeed here.
[2280.33s -> 2282.33s]  I must make them proud of me.
[2282.33s -> 2284.33s]  What's your favorite soda?
[2284.33s -> 2286.89s]  So what's been going on at school lately?
[2286.89s -> 2288.89s]  A murder was committed here.
[2288.89s -> 2290.89s]  Everyone is very stressed out.
[2290.89s -> 2292.89s]  Alright, so we have a little
[2292.89s -> 2294.89s]  bit of
[2294.89s -> 2296.89s]  actual human being here.
[2296.89s -> 2301.11s]  I heard about that.
[2301.11s -> 2303.11s]  Some kid named Jake?
[2303.11s -> 2305.11s]  Oh, yeah. Jake Rogers
[2305.11s -> 2307.11s]  was a dark soul.
[2307.11s -> 2309.11s]  He created a lot of trouble.
[2309.11s -> 2311.42s]  What do you mean a dark soul?
[2311.42s -> 2314.55s]  What do you mean by dark soul?
[2314.55s -> 2316.55s]  Jake wasn't a happy
[2316.55s -> 2318.55s]  person and made others around him
[2318.55s -> 2320.55s]  very unhappy, too.
[2320.55s -> 2322.55s]  How did Jake make people around him unhappy?
[2322.55s -> 2324.55s]  This is weird written dialogue.
[2324.55s -> 2326.55s]  In English,
[2326.55s -> 2328.55s]  you would say a bully.
[2328.55s -> 2330.55s]  He wasn't very popular.
[2330.55s -> 2332.55s]  I'm behind in my studies and I must get back to the library.
[2332.55s -> 2334.55s]  He was the dark soul of
[2334.55s -> 2336.55s]  high school students.
[2336.55s -> 2339.03s]  Oh,
[2339.03s -> 2341.85s]  can I
[2341.85s -> 2347.03s]  What's the combination?
[2347.03s -> 2349.03s]  Do you know the combination to Jake Rogers' locker?
[2349.03s -> 2351.03s]  I'm sorry, Nancy.
[2351.03s -> 2353.03s]  I can't help you with that.
[2353.03s -> 2355.03s]  How do you not know the combination?
[2355.03s -> 2357.03s]  Hoke said your locker is right next to Jake's.
[2357.03s -> 2359.03s]  Are you sure you don't know the combination?
[2359.03s -> 2361.03s]  Hmm.
[2361.03s -> 2363.03s]  I remember one day Jake was mad because
[2363.03s -> 2365.03s]  he couldn't open his locker.
[2365.03s -> 2367.03s]  He told me he wished he had a phone handy.
[2367.03s -> 2369.72s]  Would that help?
[2369.72s -> 2376.06s]  Phone handy?
[2376.06s -> 2378.06s]  He told me he wished he had a phone
[2378.06s -> 2381.88s]  to do math?
[2381.88s -> 2383.88s]  Have you heard of Hoke Sanchez?
[2383.88s -> 2385.88s]  Heard of him?
[2385.88s -> 2387.88s]  Hoke holds the conference record for quarterback sex.
[2387.88s -> 2389.88s]  He's been the state's number one player
[2389.88s -> 2391.88s]  since he was a freshman.
[2391.88s -> 2393.88s]  He's also a candidate for a big university
[2393.88s -> 2395.88s]  even with his injury.
[2395.88s -> 2397.88s]  Injury?
[2397.88s -> 2399.88s]  Hoke got hurt a few weeks ago. Ever since that game
[2399.88s -> 2401.88s]  he hasn't played the same.
[2401.88s -> 2403.88s]  I worry that his chances of playing for
[2403.88s -> 2405.88s]  top school are not as good
[2405.88s -> 2407.88s]  as before his injury.
[2407.88s -> 2409.88s]  Hmm, interesting.
[2409.88s -> 2411.88s]  Do you know Connie Watson?
[2411.88s -> 2413.88s]  Yes, we've been in a few classes together.
[2413.88s -> 2417.40s]  I think she was dating Jake Rogers.
[2417.40s -> 2422.58s]  Yeah, where is this looking out to?
[2422.58s -> 2424.58s]  They need to mow the grass.
[2424.58s -> 2427.34s]  That shit is getting wild.
[2427.34s -> 2429.34s]  What can you tell me about Daryl Gray?
[2429.34s -> 2431.34s]  He's very popular
[2431.34s -> 2433.34s]  and a good politician too.
[2433.34s -> 2435.34s]  Just like his father.
[2435.34s -> 2437.70s]  Like his father?
[2437.70s -> 2439.70s]  I hear he was a great politician
[2439.70s -> 2441.70s]  but not a very good businessman.
[2441.70s -> 2444.07s]  I think his company went bankrupt
[2444.07s -> 2446.07s]  a few years ago.
[2446.07s -> 2448.31s]  See ya.
[2448.31s -> 2450.31s]  See you later, Nancy.
[2450.31s -> 2452.68s]  Here's my phone.
[2452.68s -> 2474.38s]  Holy shit, Nancy.
[2474.38s -> 2476.38s]  You don't have very many people
[2476.38s -> 2478.38s]  in your phone.
[2478.38s -> 2480.38s]  That's it. Just Ned.
[2480.38s -> 2485.80s]  Only Ned.
[2485.80s -> 2487.80s]  Is this Martha Windeglassen?
[2487.80s -> 2489.80s]  Who is please calling me?
[2489.80s -> 2491.80s]  Um, no.
[2491.80s -> 2493.80s]  I'm trying to reach Ned Nickerson.
[2493.80s -> 2495.80s]  Nancy, it's Ned.
[2495.80s -> 2497.80s]  I thought with you being undercover and everything
[2497.80s -> 2499.80s]  I had to take on a different persona.
[2499.80s -> 2501.80s]  Ned, I'm the one who's undercover, not you.
[2501.80s -> 2503.80s]  Okay, okay.
[2503.80s -> 2505.80s]  I guess I'll just go undercover vicariously through you.
[2505.80s -> 2507.80s]  Which for some odd reason feels very
[2507.80s -> 2509.80s]  deja vu.
[2509.80s -> 2511.80s]  Would it probably be a good idea if you didn't
[2511.80s -> 2513.80s]  mention my assignment to anyone?
[2513.80s -> 2515.80s]  You never know who may be related
[2515.80s -> 2517.80s]  to this case, even up at Emerson.
[2517.80s -> 2519.80s]  Your secret's safe with me,
[2519.80s -> 2522.17s]  along with your heart.
[2522.17s -> 2524.17s]  You're such a sweetie.
[2524.17s -> 2526.17s]  Enough lovey-dovey talk. It'll make me miss you even more.
[2526.17s -> 2528.17s]  So have you found any homicidal secrets yet?
[2528.17s -> 2530.17s]  Have we even seen each other in real life?
[2530.17s -> 2534.20s]  I feel like we haven't.
[2534.20s -> 2539.96s]  Ciao.
[2539.96s -> 2541.96s]  Because I'm playing as a senior detective, I don't need a task list.
[2541.96s -> 2543.96s]  What?
[2543.96s -> 2547.22s]  Did that.
[2547.22s -> 2555.86s]  Are you kidding me?
[2555.86s -> 2559.26s]  Another coin? Cool.
[2559.26s -> 2561.26s]  Another coin in the trash?
[2561.26s -> 2564.26s]  There's a lot of coins now.
[2564.26s -> 2566.26s]  Alright, let's go back to the locker and see what the hell's going on here.
[2566.26s -> 2572.09s]  Alright, he needed a phone.
[2572.09s -> 2575.29s]  Why would he need a phone?
[2575.29s -> 2582.07s]  He needed a phone.
[2582.07s -> 2588.07s]  Why would he need a phone for this?
[2588.07s -> 2604.90s]  Maybe the code is...
[2604.90s -> 2606.90s]  Yeah, maybe it's like...
[2606.90s -> 2610.17s]  Why would you put a picture of your...
[2610.17s -> 2614.84s]  Maybe take the phone out here?
[2614.84s -> 2616.84s]  Zoom?
[2616.84s -> 2621.13s]  I don't know, is there anything over here?
[2621.13s -> 2624.26s]  Get Hulk to rip the door off.
[2624.26s -> 2628.55s]  Maybe it's his phone number.
[2628.55s -> 2631.11s]  The last four digits?
[2631.11s -> 2633.11s]  I don't think I have that info though.
[2633.11s -> 2643.53s]  Who am I calling?
[2643.53s -> 2648.20s]  She hangs up. Who hung up?
[2648.20s -> 2674.50s]  It's Jake.
[2674.50s -> 2681.29s]  Oh shit, it was Jake.
[2681.29s -> 2683.29s]  A treatise on etiquette.
[2683.29s -> 2686.68s]  There's a ripped up piece of paper in here.
[2686.68s -> 2693.51s]  What else have we got?
[2693.51s -> 2695.51s]  T120.
[2695.51s -> 2697.51s]  There's a tape. The tape is gone though.
[2697.51s -> 2701.03s]  Judo today.
[2701.03s -> 2703.03s]  New judo trends. Tournament winners.
[2703.03s -> 2705.03s]  Holds and throws with style.
[2705.03s -> 2707.59s]  Masked Marauder flattens foes.
[2711.24s -> 2714.38s]  Masked Marauder flattens foes.
[2716.38s -> 2725.66s]  I don't know anything about judo.
[2725.66s -> 2727.66s]  Who's winning here?
[2727.66s -> 2730.41s]  Is this guy doing a huge flip
[2730.41s -> 2732.41s]  over the other guy and ripping him forward?
[2732.41s -> 2734.41s]  Or is the other guy throwing him over the shoulder?
[2734.41s -> 2736.41s]  I don't know who's winning.
[2736.41s -> 2750.10s]  Breaking at local pharmacy.
[2750.10s -> 2754.78s]  Paseo County Police responded to a breaking
[2754.78s -> 2756.78s]  at the drug station pharmacy on 80th Street
[2756.78s -> 2758.78s]  in the early morning hours yesterday.
[2758.78s -> 2760.78s]  Whoever it was knew exactly what they were looking for.
[2760.78s -> 2763.14s]  They broke in the building
[2763.14s -> 2765.14s]  through the back window, took the drugs
[2765.14s -> 2767.14s]  and were out for minutes.
[2767.14s -> 2769.14s]  According to the report, several vials of
[2769.14s -> 2771.14s]  hectanol were taken.
[2771.14s -> 2773.14s]  We were just lucky that
[2773.14s -> 2775.14s]  no of the damage was done to the store.
[2775.14s -> 2779.22s]  What is hectanol?
[2779.22s -> 2781.22s]  Why was there a coin in the A?
[2781.22s -> 2783.72s]  Alright, so we've got
[2783.72s -> 2786.15s]  breaking at the pharmacy.
[2786.15s -> 2788.15s]  Let's go talk to the pharmacy.
[2788.15s -> 2792.57s]  Alright, let's go talk to the pharmacy.
[2792.57s -> 2804.52s]  Wait! Let's go.
[2843.02s -> 2845.02s]  This is pretty sick, actually.
[2846.02s -> 2853.51s]  You know what they haven't made in a long time?
[2853.51s -> 2856.14s]  An updated cool
[2856.14s -> 2858.14s]  version of this game.
[2858.14s -> 2862.30s]  They keep making the same iPad version.
[2862.30s -> 2866.20s]  No, not Peggle.
[2866.20s -> 2873.05s]  Breakout.
[2875.93s -> 2878.42s]  Cool Breakout? Yeah.
[2878.42s -> 2880.86s]  I remember the best part about
[2880.86s -> 2882.86s]  Breakout is when you beat a level
[2882.86s -> 2884.86s]  and the ball stayed up top and you just
[2884.86s -> 2886.86s]  let it just auto play.
[2886.86s -> 2888.86s]  And have it just take out. It just got stuck
[2888.86s -> 2890.86s]  on the top row.
[2890.86s -> 2892.86s]  And almost the whole level would get completed.
[2892.86s -> 2894.86s]  Let's see if we can do it.
[2894.86s -> 2899.51s]  Do it. Oh, come on.
[2899.51s -> 2909.93s]  How many levels are there?
[2909.93s -> 2912.36s]  Get stuck up there.
[2912.36s -> 2915.82s]  Oh wow, this made it real easy.
[2915.82s -> 2917.82s]  This is an amateur detective, not a
[2917.82s -> 2923.69s]  master detective anymore.
[2923.69s -> 2925.69s]  Forty hour minigame. Do I get anything
[2925.69s -> 2929.59s]  for doing this? I lost. Yeah, it's okay.
[2929.59s -> 2941.05s]  You lost our respect.
[2941.05s -> 2945.27s]  Don't worry, I'll get it back.
[2945.27s -> 2948.22s]  I'll get it back when I bag the
[2948.22s -> 2950.22s]  killer for who threw Jake
[2950.22s -> 2954.31s]  down the stairs.
[2954.31s -> 2956.31s]  Probably not tonight though, because this is probably like
[2956.31s -> 2958.31s]  a 16 hour game.
[2958.31s -> 2961.00s]  And we're doing, hopefully, no more heroes
[2961.00s -> 2965.80s]  tomorrow.
[2965.80s -> 2969.70s]  Oh, nice. Alright, I gotta make this work.
[2969.70s -> 2971.94s]  Get in there. Come on, get in.
[2971.94s -> 2973.94s]  In, in, in. No, in, in.
[2973.94s -> 2975.94s]  Ah, it's over. I wrote it.
[2975.94s -> 2991.29s]  It's alright. Is this 700,000
[2991.29s -> 2994.49s]  games?
[2994.49s -> 2996.66s]  It's probably better than
[2996.66s -> 2998.66s]  what's on that disc.
[2998.66s -> 3002.38s]  Is this available on Steam? Yeah, it is.
[3002.38s -> 3011.66s]  I think all of them are.
[3011.66s -> 3028.49s]  At least most of them. This is nice.
[3028.49s -> 3030.49s]  I actually am really, I'm just kind of
[3030.49s -> 3042.52s]  relaxing now.
[3042.52s -> 3044.82s]  Yeah, that was pretty good sync.
[3044.82s -> 3046.82s]  I'm gonna say there's probably five levels.
[3046.82s -> 3048.82s]  And I'm never doing this again, so I might as well try to beat it.
[3048.82s -> 3050.82s]  And get the achievement at the end of the game.
[3050.82s -> 3054.22s]  We needed
[3054.22s -> 3056.22s]  to unwind after that slide puzzle.
[3056.22s -> 3059.99s]  Yeah, we needed a good unwind.
[3059.99s -> 3068.31s]  Which in itself should be an
[3068.31s -> 3070.31s]  unwind, but it wasn't.
[3070.31s -> 3073.77s]  I can't believe I almost turned the power button
[3073.77s -> 3076.52s]  off on my computer.
[3076.52s -> 3078.52s]  I was gonna do it too, and I'm gonna be like, fuck it, I'll see you
[3078.52s -> 3091.45s]  tomorrow.
[3091.45s -> 3093.45s]  Almost makes you forget that someone was
[3093.45s -> 3098.44s]  murdered. Yeah,
[3098.44s -> 3100.44s]  as a detective I shouldn't be doing this.
[3100.44s -> 3102.44s]  Shouldn't I have dusted this thing for fingerprints?
[3107.94s -> 3112.42s]  God, how many levels are there?
[3112.42s -> 3117.67s]  I wanna get it up there.
[3117.67s -> 3119.91s]  Come on, do it.
[3119.91s -> 3123.24s]  Get up there.
[3123.24s -> 3125.54s]  Get up there.
[3125.54s -> 3138.34s]  Do I have ten lives?
[3138.34s -> 3140.34s]  This is never gonna end.
[3140.34s -> 3148.09s]  If I could turn my camera on right now, I would.
[3148.09s -> 3153.72s]  I don't do this very often,
[3153.72s -> 3162.74s]  but I'm doing it right now.
[3162.74s -> 3164.74s]  I'm leaning forward on my desk with my
[3164.74s -> 3166.74s]  left hand. My left elbow
[3166.74s -> 3168.74s]  is on the desk, and my
[3168.74s -> 3170.74s]  left hand is on my chin.
[3170.74s -> 3179.13s]  In a fist, just kinda hanging up.
[3179.13s -> 3181.13s]  Why didn't I look?
[3181.13s -> 3183.13s]  I wasn't even looking, I looked away.
[3183.13s -> 3185.30s]  Now I know why no one's
[3185.30s -> 3187.30s]  made another version of this game, because after five
[3187.30s -> 3189.30s]  levels you're like, alright, this is, I'm done.
[3189.30s -> 3192.18s]  There's a reason why no one has
[3192.18s -> 3194.18s]  revolutionized the breakout
[3194.18s -> 3212.81s]  game. Battle Royale
[3212.81s -> 3217.48s]  Breakout? Alright, there can't
[3217.48s -> 3224.65s]  be more than ten levels.
[3224.65s -> 3226.65s]  You're killing me. You're killing me.
[3226.65s -> 3228.65s]  Come on. Alright.
[3228.65s -> 3230.95s]  Level six.
[3230.95s -> 3233.50s]  What does that say?
[3233.50s -> 3235.80s]  Eighty...
[3235.80s -> 3241.11s]  Eighty what?
[3241.11s -> 3244.25s]  I gotta sit up.
[3244.25s -> 3246.25s]  Alright, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up. I'm starting to not care.
[3246.25s -> 3250.34s]  I have to care.
[3250.34s -> 3252.65s]  Does Bond?
[3252.65s -> 3254.65s]  I wonder if that's a code or something. Maybe that is a code for something.
[3254.65s -> 3267.00s]  I want a pizza so bad.
[3267.00s -> 3269.24s]  I don't, what is it with
[3269.24s -> 3271.24s]  streaming? It's something about
[3271.24s -> 3273.24s]  streaming. On a day-to-day basis,
[3273.24s -> 3275.24s]  I don't want to eat pizza.
[3275.24s -> 3277.24s]  But during a stream,
[3277.24s -> 3279.24s]  I sit here, and I just
[3279.24s -> 3281.24s]  think, you know, I just want a full pizza.
[3281.24s -> 3283.24s]  It's only when I'm streaming.
[3283.24s -> 3290.86s]  Me too? Do you guys
[3290.86s -> 3295.66s]  get that too? Maybe it's a Twitch
[3295.66s -> 3298.47s]  thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3298.47s -> 3304.81s]  S...
[3304.81s -> 3306.81s]  SCK.
[3306.81s -> 3312.36s]  Suck?
[3312.36s -> 3318.50s]  Sucks.
[3321.32s -> 3324.76s]  I want to hit those three
[3324.76s -> 3326.76s]  whirlpools. I want to make it harder.
[3326.76s -> 3336.74s]  It's definitely ten.
[3336.74s -> 3338.74s]  Why would it be more than ten?
[3338.74s -> 3341.50s]  I guess it's not that hard to make these games
[3341.50s -> 3343.50s]  because once you have the template for them,
[3343.50s -> 3345.50s]  you can make ten thousand of them.
[3345.50s -> 3353.80s]  Maybe they just never end.
[3353.80s -> 3362.12s]  Comes in a break. What if it's just randomly generated?
[3362.12s -> 3364.12s]  That would be bad.
[3364.12s -> 3374.92s]  It's the eyes.
[3374.92s -> 3376.92s]  When you get it going sideways, it's good
[3376.92s -> 3378.92s]  shit. It's going sideways.
[3378.92s -> 3380.92s]  Come on, do them all.
[3380.92s -> 3394.47s]  Yeah.
[3394.47s -> 3397.29s]  Wii Sports Party Game?
[3397.29s -> 3399.29s]  Well, let me do No More Heroes first. I gotta get my
[3399.29s -> 3410.62s]  Wii mode to function.
[3410.62s -> 3412.62s]  Only two more levels and I, regardless,
[3412.62s -> 3419.78s]  I'm done. This is nice, though.
[3419.78s -> 3422.15s]  Yeah.
[3422.15s -> 3424.90s]  This is the taking a bath
[3424.90s -> 3426.90s]  of video games. Level nine.
[3426.90s -> 3430.81s]  Speed it up.
[3433.43s -> 3435.43s]  That was fast, holy shit.
[3435.43s -> 3451.37s]  Another sorting
[3451.37s -> 3453.37s]  algorithm.
[3453.37s -> 3455.67s]  I almost hit five hundred thousand points.
[3461.69s -> 3464.31s]  What kind of bath is like this?
[3464.31s -> 3466.31s]  Well, I mean, just the way that my brain is
[3466.31s -> 3468.31s]  acting right now. I'm just relaxing.
[3468.31s -> 3470.31s]  I feel good.
[3470.31s -> 3485.08s]  Get all the beaks. You're coming down
[3485.08s -> 3487.08s]  from the drugs.
[3489.08s -> 3500.41s]  God damn it.
[3500.41s -> 3502.41s]  This better
[3502.41s -> 3504.41s]  be it. This better be it.
[3504.41s -> 3509.66s]  Is it Y2K?
[3509.66s -> 3535.43s]  Yes. Is it raining?
[3535.43s -> 3544.20s]  No. Maybe in the game.
[3544.20s -> 3546.70s]  All right. I gotta get back to detective work.
[3546.70s -> 3549.32s]  This is putting me to sleep.
[3549.32s -> 3551.32s]  And I am not going to sleep without a full pizza.
[3551.32s -> 3553.32s]  So like that's not going to happen.
[3553.32s -> 3555.82s]  Get to one million points.
[3555.82s -> 3566.70s]  Damn it. All right.
[3566.70s -> 3568.70s]  This looks like a final level. Look at this.
[3568.70s -> 3570.70s]  This is like original Donkey Kong.
[3570.70s -> 3597.51s]  Yes.
[3597.51s -> 3600.71s]  That's what I wanted.
[3600.71s -> 3602.71s]  That's all I wanted.
[3623.45s -> 3635.54s]  What about the...
[3635.54s -> 3637.54s]  What about the guy that was murdered?
[3637.54s -> 3640.42s]  Yeah.
[3640.42s -> 3642.42s]  I'll get to it. I promise.
[3642.42s -> 3650.15s]  Who?
[3650.15s -> 3652.15s]  What do you mean? Oh. Who?
[3652.15s -> 3654.15s]  I think his name... I don't even remember his name.
[3654.15s -> 3662.98s]  Jake?
[3662.98s -> 3664.98s]  All right. Fine.
[3664.98s -> 3666.98s]  You guys want me to test for it? I will.
[3666.98s -> 3671.98s]  Never mind. I am just too late.
[3671.98s -> 3673.98s]  I was going to blow into my Wii mode again.
[3679.98s -> 3681.98s]  Oh no.
[3681.98s -> 3683.98s]  I have to like brush my teeth.
[3683.98s -> 3685.98s]  Oh boy. Oh my god.
[3685.98s -> 3687.98s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[3687.98s -> 3689.98s]  This is a used Wii mode and I didn't clean it.
[3689.98s -> 3691.98s]  And I put it in my mouth like four times.
[3691.98s -> 3693.98s]  Ah!
[3693.98s -> 3699.16s]  Oh no. No. No.
[3699.16s -> 3701.16s]  And there's like stuff on it.
[3701.16s -> 3703.53s]  Oh fuck. What happened?
[3703.53s -> 3706.79s]  Oh my god.
[3706.79s -> 3720.98s]  Oh my fucking god.
[3720.98s -> 3722.98s]  I have to brush my fucking teeth right now.
[3725.61s -> 3736.04s]  You see this?
[3736.04s -> 3739.75s]  Darn it!
[3739.75s -> 3741.75s]  I'll be right back.
[3741.75s -> 3862.82s]  I'll be right back.
[3862.82s -> 3867.30s]  God damn it.
[3867.30s -> 3870.44s]  I hate that.
[3870.44s -> 3872.44s]  I hate it.
[3872.44s -> 3876.92s]  Oh my god.
[3876.92s -> 3900.86s]  Oh.
[3900.86s -> 3907.45s]  It's like in a room with like
[3907.45s -> 3909.45s]  a shitload of cigarettes in it.
[3909.45s -> 3912.33s]  It's yellow.
[3912.33s -> 3916.17s]  Like it was probably
[3916.17s -> 3918.17s]  somebody probably smoked in their house.
[3918.17s -> 3921.43s]  Look.
[3921.43s -> 3923.43s]  Somebody probably was just like a smoker
[3923.43s -> 3925.43s]  and that's like all the smoke filth.
[3928.06s -> 3934.26s]  That fucking, that shit
[3934.26s -> 3936.26s]  was in my mouth and I didn't even clean it.
[3936.26s -> 3938.26s]  Oh my god.
[3938.26s -> 3940.26s]  How far did I put it in my mouth?
[3940.26s -> 3944.23s]  It's Cheetos.
[3944.23s -> 3946.23s]  That's somehow worse.
[3946.23s -> 3948.23s]  What you just said is worse. I'm just thinking of some
[3948.23s -> 3950.23s]  some like fucking kid
[3950.23s -> 3952.23s]  with like Cheeto covered hands
[3952.23s -> 3954.23s]  always and never washing his hands.
[3954.23s -> 3958.84s]  No. That's definitely
[3958.84s -> 3960.84s]  a cigarette. Oh! That's a cigarette
[3960.84s -> 3962.84s]  stain. That's somebody's fucking
[3962.84s -> 3964.84s]  cigarette fingers.
[3964.84s -> 3967.78s]  Fuck.
[3975.78s -> 3984.60s]  Damn it.
[3984.60s -> 3986.60s]  Old plastic turns yellow.
[3986.60s -> 3988.60s]  I know but you don't, I put it in my mouth.
[3988.60s -> 4002.17s]  I just like
[4002.17s -> 4004.17s]  I just put somebody's
[4004.17s -> 4006.17s]  cigarette fingers in my mouth.
[4024.92s -> 4030.49s]  What level is this?
[4030.49s -> 4032.49s]  It wasn't on camera. Oh I'm talking about from like
[4032.49s -> 4034.49s]  two hours ago. Like three hours ago.
[4034.49s -> 4039.29s]  That was a delayed reaction.
[4061.45s -> 4063.45s]  We did get, we got the cool Drupi
[4063.45s -> 4070.23s]  picture though.
[4070.23s -> 4079.45s]  Yeah but is that
[4079.45s -> 4081.45s]  is that worth getting like
[4081.45s -> 4084.97s]  is that worth getting like cigarette
[4084.97s -> 4093.74s]  hepatitis? Yes.
[4093.74s -> 4102.31s]  This is garage band music.
[4102.31s -> 4105.13s]  Alright if
[4105.13s -> 4107.13s]  I can't stop at 13 because like that's unlucky.
[4107.13s -> 4109.13s]  So if it's
[4109.13s -> 4111.13s]  there's more than 13 probably. I'm
[4111.13s -> 4113.13s]  gonna turn my computer off. Five.
[4113.13s -> 4115.13s]  Four. Just kidding.
[4115.13s -> 4127.40s]  Finish the
[4127.40s -> 4133.54s]  barnacle game.
[4133.54s -> 4135.54s]  I fucking
[4135.54s -> 4139.77s]  fucking can again.
[4139.77s -> 4141.77s]  Alright this one. This is it. This is it. I don't care. This is it.
[4141.77s -> 4143.77s]  I'm gonna stop at 14. I don't care. I'm done.
[4152.20s -> 4163.08s]  Mouth. Isn't there a murder solve?
[4163.08s -> 4165.08s]  Yes. Eventually. Maybe I
[4165.08s -> 4167.08s]  will eventually.
[4167.08s -> 4178.92s]  Once this girl in my eighth grade class
[4178.92s -> 4180.92s]  licked a pig heart we were dissecting.
[4188.17s -> 4190.17s]  Oh wow.
[4190.17s -> 4198.34s]  Yeah but don't
[4198.34s -> 4201.48s]  don't they
[4201.48s -> 4203.48s]  like dunk those things in acid to
[4203.48s -> 4205.48s]  clean them? This wee moat was not
[4205.48s -> 4207.48s]  dunked in like dissecting fluid.
[4207.48s -> 4211.19s]  Somebody scratched their ass, smoked
[4211.19s -> 4213.19s]  five packs of cigarettes and put it into a box.
[4213.19s -> 4234.57s]  Bite into a raw egg
[4234.57s -> 4238.02s]  to kill the bacteria.
[4238.02s -> 4240.46s]  What would that do?
[4240.46s -> 4247.62s]  I licked the floor
[4247.62s -> 4249.62s]  of a school bus once.
[4249.62s -> 4259.10s]  Why can I see? You know
[4259.10s -> 4261.10s]  like images you can
[4261.10s -> 4263.10s]  hear. Why can I hear
[4263.10s -> 4266.49s]  that story? Like a bunch of kids
[4266.49s -> 4268.49s]  saying, you want to lick the bottom of the school bus?
[4268.49s -> 4270.49s]  Yeah I will. No you won't.
[4270.49s -> 4272.49s]  Loser.
[4272.49s -> 4274.49s]  Yeah.
[4274.49s -> 4277.74s]  He did it. Whoa.
[4277.74s -> 4281.00s]  I can hear that image.
[4281.00s -> 4283.00s]  The bus driver's like shut the fuck
[4283.00s -> 4288.82s]  up back there.
[4288.82s -> 4290.82s]  The bus driver's just like hey
[4290.82s -> 4293.26s]  you little bastards.
[4293.26s -> 4296.90s]  Don't touch anything.
[4296.90s -> 4299.14s]  How dare you
[4299.14s -> 4301.14s]  lick my bus.
[4301.14s -> 4304.07s]  You little shits.
[4304.07s -> 4306.07s]  Okay I gotta pay attention.
[4331.27s -> 4336.26s]  I need to say something.
[4336.26s -> 4339.14s]  Okay. Can we
[4339.14s -> 4341.14s]  give it up
[4341.14s -> 4343.14s]  a little bit here and give
[4343.14s -> 4345.14s]  the respect that's deserved
[4345.14s -> 4347.14s]  to our school bus drivers?
[4347.14s -> 4351.11s]  The amount of shit
[4351.11s -> 4353.11s]  that they have to listen to
[4353.11s -> 4355.11s]  and the amount of nonsense
[4355.11s -> 4357.11s]  that they have to potentially put up with.
[4357.11s -> 4359.11s]  And they've got to pay attention.
[4359.11s -> 4361.11s]  They've got to make sure they get these
[4361.11s -> 4363.11s]  kids around safely.
[4363.11s -> 4366.06s]  That's a pretty
[4366.06s -> 4368.06s]  that requires a little bit of
[4368.06s -> 4372.66s]  applause.
[4372.66s -> 4374.66s]  Because I am
[4374.66s -> 4376.66s]  I cannot imagine me ever
[4376.66s -> 4380.18s]  in any scenario
[4380.18s -> 4382.18s]  where I would be able to pay attention and drive
[4382.18s -> 4401.45s]  with this going on.
[4401.45s -> 4418.14s]  Think about it. What the fuck is this?
[4418.14s -> 4420.44s]  What a weird gif.
[4420.44s -> 4430.94s]  Okay. Alright so
[4430.94s -> 4432.94s]  imagine driving a car and needing to pay attention
[4432.94s -> 4434.94s]  to this going on. This is why we need to give our respect
[4434.94s -> 4444.86s]  to those people.
[4444.86s -> 4451.83s]  Okay I have to get
[4451.83s -> 4464.18s]  off at the next exit.
[4464.18s -> 4468.34s]  Stop!
[4479.46s -> 4489.38s]  Shut up back there.
[4489.38s -> 4497.64s]  This is a long video.
[4510.31s -> 4522.73s]  This is fucking loud.
[4522.73s -> 4537.00s]  No it's just like an airplane.
[4537.00s -> 4540.01s]  That's like an airplane
[4540.01s -> 4543.85s]  sound. Why would that come up as
[4543.85s -> 4557.61s]  a car driving?
[4557.61s -> 4559.61s]  Okay I don't know why I saw
[4559.61s -> 4561.61s]  car sounds sleeping.
[4561.61s -> 4563.85s]  Car sounds white noise
[4563.85s -> 4565.85s]  for sleep. Why would a sleep
[4565.85s -> 4571.10s]  what are you talking about?
[4571.10s -> 4573.10s]  No I can't add all that fucking
[4573.10s -> 4593.64s]  bullshit. Alright
[4593.64s -> 4601.51s]  give me a second.
[4601.51s -> 4606.82s]  No these are cars driving by on the highway.
[4606.82s -> 4621.99s]  That's not going to work.
[4654.10s -> 4661.02s]  Nope. I ain't going there.
[4661.02s -> 4663.02s]  I ain't going there.
[4667.58s -> 4669.58s]  I ain't going there.
[4669.58s -> 4680.78s]  Let's try.
[4682.78s -> 4685.40s]  No
[4685.40s -> 4687.40s]  there's a stage where that goes
[4687.40s -> 4689.40s]  too far and I don't want to take it
[4689.40s -> 4691.40s]  there.
[4698.12s -> 4703.62s]  Just go!
[4703.62s -> 4705.62s]  Just go! Go! Go! Just go! Do the detective
[4705.62s -> 4708.38s]  case!
[4708.38s -> 4712.34s]  Get me out!
[4712.34s -> 4714.34s]  Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
[4714.34s -> 4716.34s]  Out! Out! Out! Out!
[4716.34s -> 4728.62s]  Hi Nancy. How can I get
[4728.62s -> 4730.62s]  into the teacher's lounge? Why is this so loud?
[4730.62s -> 4734.46s]  Look Nancy maybe this assignment
[4734.46s -> 4736.46s]  isn't for you. I can't be holding your
[4736.46s -> 4738.46s]  hand all the time. Your job is to come
[4738.46s -> 4740.46s]  to me with solutions not
[4740.46s -> 4742.46s]  problems. When the police looked through Jake's
[4742.46s -> 4744.46s]  locker did they take a videotape? When the police
[4744.46s -> 4746.46s]  looked through Jake's locker did they take
[4746.46s -> 4748.46s]  a videotape? No
[4748.46s -> 4752.42s]  we didn't.
[4752.42s -> 4754.42s]  That was a very unconvincing note.
[4765.43s -> 4767.43s]  Okay so I need to find the videotape.
[4777.48s -> 4779.48s]  I would appreciate the
[4779.48s -> 4782.04s]  if we got rid of the Mario Kart
[4782.04s -> 4784.04s]  intro music.
[4784.04s -> 4794.92s]  Is there anything else in the house?
[4794.92s -> 4796.92s]  What the hell am I supposed to do?
[4796.92s -> 4810.55s]  Besides drink soda.
[4810.55s -> 4812.55s]  What the hell do high school kids do?
[4812.55s -> 4815.43s]  Besides walk around and drink soda.
[4815.43s -> 4819.72s]  Hey Nancy. Need something?
[4819.72s -> 4822.41s]  Do you know why Jake had an empty
[4822.41s -> 4824.41s]  videocassette case in his locker?
[4824.41s -> 4826.41s]  No. Why are you so interested
[4826.41s -> 4828.41s]  in Jake anyway?
[4828.41s -> 4831.10s]  I gotta go now. Later. Nancy
[4831.10s -> 4833.53s]  I'm starting to wonder about you.
[4833.53s -> 4835.53s]  Didn't I hear you were dating Jake?
[4835.53s -> 4837.53s]  Hey a girl can make a
[4837.53s -> 4840.15s]  mistake can't she?
[4840.15s -> 4842.15s]  Do you know how Tanaka?
[4842.15s -> 4844.15s]  Not very well. He's an exchange student
[4844.15s -> 4846.15s]  from Japan and a total workaholic.
[4846.15s -> 4848.33s]  He told me he's trying to get
[4848.33s -> 4850.33s]  more scholarships for college.
[4850.33s -> 4852.33s]  Lately he's been looking really burnt out.
[4852.33s -> 4854.33s]  I think the pressure's getting to him.
[4854.33s -> 4856.33s]  What pressure?
[4856.33s -> 4858.33s]  I guess it's a big deal for his family
[4858.33s -> 4860.33s]  that he'd get into a good school on a free ride.
[4860.33s -> 4863.46s]  I'll let you go.
[4863.46s -> 4865.46s]  Bye Nancy.
[4865.46s -> 4870.70s]  Okay. What's
[4870.70s -> 4873.38s]  to play here? What do I have a key?
[4873.38s -> 4875.38s]  What's this key for? You got it? Wait. Okay.
[4875.38s -> 4878.07s]  What's the key for?
[4878.07s -> 4880.07s]  Have I found a key yet?
[4880.07s -> 4882.31s]  Have I found a place for this to go?
[4882.31s -> 4886.47s]  Is it the maintenance closet?
[4886.47s -> 4888.90s]  No. This might be a puzzle.
[4888.90s -> 4900.23s]  What would it want me to do?
[4900.23s -> 4905.46s]  Go to the library? What the hell is the
[4905.46s -> 4910.71s]  library? I mean that's the exit.
[4910.71s -> 4916.46s]  Other way?
[4916.46s -> 4918.46s]  Down here? Library.
[4918.46s -> 4922.86s]  Library. Library?
[4922.86s -> 4928.94s]  This library sucks.
[4928.94s -> 4933.16s]  Do you know why Jake had an
[4933.16s -> 4935.16s]  empty video cassette case in his
[4935.16s -> 4939.90s]  Yeah I see it. I see it. I see it
[4939.90s -> 4941.90s]  and it's beautiful. It's very nice.
[4941.90s -> 4943.90s]  It's very very nice. I didn't know Jake was
[4943.90s -> 4945.90s]  interested in video. I avoided him
[4945.90s -> 4947.90s]  whenever I could.
[4947.90s -> 4955.70s]  Jesus Christ.
[4955.70s -> 4957.70s]  I avoided him whenever I could.
[4957.70s -> 4959.70s]  I hated him. He was an asshole. He was a piece of shit.
[4959.70s -> 4961.70s]  Nobody liked him. I don't like him.
[4961.70s -> 4964.07s]  He sucked.
[4964.07s -> 4966.07s]  My God.
[4974.07s -> 4980.28s]  Are you in the library?
[4980.28s -> 4982.71s]  You're in the library.
[4982.71s -> 4990.26s]  That's where you are.
[4990.26s -> 4999.67s]  Oh no. Here's a library.
[4999.67s -> 5004.15s]  Who locks a school
[5004.15s -> 5007.61s]  library?
[5007.61s -> 5009.61s]  Is there forbidden knowledge in here? I don't understand.
[5009.61s -> 5011.61s]  Monday through Thursday, 8 to 4. I can't go in there.
[5011.61s -> 5014.17s]  Yeah I can. Give me that key.
[5014.17s -> 5040.39s]  Fiction. Secret
[5040.39s -> 5051.00s]  books? No.
[5051.00s -> 5054.97s]  What is a relic?
[5054.97s -> 5057.40s]  What's a relic? I don't know.
[5057.40s -> 5059.40s]  A perfect alibi.
[5059.40s -> 5069.30s]  Doesn't seem to be very interesting.
[5069.30s -> 5074.81s]  What even is a relic?
[5074.81s -> 5076.81s]  It's weird. I know exactly what a relic is.
[5076.81s -> 5078.81s]  But it's hard for me to describe to you what a relic is.
[5078.81s -> 5080.81s]  It's an old
[5080.81s -> 5082.81s]  piece of an
[5082.81s -> 5084.81s]  old medallion or an old
[5084.81s -> 5086.81s]  crafted thing
[5086.81s -> 5089.75s]  that is
[5089.75s -> 5091.75s]  old and from an old
[5091.75s -> 5093.75s]  culture, an old
[5093.75s -> 5096.44s]  religion.
[5096.44s -> 5098.44s]  It's an object
[5098.44s -> 5100.44s]  that holds significant potential
[5100.44s -> 5110.30s]  cultural value.
[5110.30s -> 5113.62s]  Where's my
[5113.62s -> 5115.62s]  book?
[5115.62s -> 5120.81s]  Didn't I read somebody's password?
[5120.81s -> 5130.73s]  Catalog search. What am I looking for?
[5130.73s -> 5144.36s]  What was the name?
[5144.36s -> 5149.22s]  What was the relic?
[5149.22s -> 5158.44s]  Check shelf.
[5158.44s -> 5160.44s]  Star Wars. It's not going to be a Star Wars book.
[5160.44s -> 5165.30s]  This book is something I'm specifically looking for.
[5165.30s -> 5170.55s]  I don't know what it is though.
[5170.55s -> 5172.55s]  What were some of the other names of those?
[5172.55s -> 5175.30s]  I don't think there was a book.
[5175.30s -> 5178.18s]  There was something written down.
[5178.18s -> 5180.18s]  Somebody has a book somewhere.
[5180.18s -> 5183.51s]  Why did the music just change?
[5183.51s -> 5205.70s]  What the fuck is going on?
[5205.70s -> 5207.70s]  Do I have to look these up?
[5207.70s -> 5209.70s]  There's got to be something about...
[5209.70s -> 5211.70s]  What's this one called? The Meltdown?
[5211.70s -> 5213.70s]  Digital Meltdown.
[5213.70s -> 5215.70s]  A novel by Jeremy
[5215.70s -> 5218.97s]  Albertson. What's this one called?
[5218.97s -> 5222.30s]  The Crystal
[5222.30s -> 5234.14s]  Skulls? Jake was here.
[5234.14s -> 5236.82s]  Things to remember.
[5236.82s -> 5238.82s]  The answer to my fate lies
[5238.82s -> 5240.82s]  in the box.
[5240.82s -> 5242.82s]  A matchbook behind Maxine's
[5242.82s -> 5244.82s]  schedule holds the first step.
[5244.82s -> 5246.82s]  My messages hold the remaining
[5246.82s -> 5248.82s]  18 steps.
[5248.82s -> 5251.51s]  The elements tell the
[5251.51s -> 5253.51s]  order. The letter and
[5253.51s -> 5255.51s]  digit tell the direction.
[5255.51s -> 5258.39s]  J.R.
[5258.39s -> 5273.29s]  God, man. U2.
[5273.29s -> 5276.68s]  Where is U2?
[5276.68s -> 5283.72s]  What element is U2?
[5283.72s -> 5292.36s]  No, we've got to go...
[5292.36s -> 5294.36s]  Underneath the schedule.
[5294.36s -> 5297.56s]  It's an incomplete table.
[5297.56s -> 5301.59s]  Matchbook behind Maxine's schedule.
[5301.59s -> 5304.34s]  Well, let's go
[5304.34s -> 5312.39s]  Let's go look at that.
[5312.39s -> 5314.39s]  Take a screenshot of this.
[5314.39s -> 5327.51s]  Yeah, good idea.
[5327.51s -> 5333.85s]  Good call. I hate when it goes to
[5333.85s -> 5335.85s]  this music. It always goes back to this.
[5335.85s -> 5345.37s]  Alright, who's
[5345.37s -> 5347.37s]  gonna find Maxine?
[5347.37s -> 5351.46s]  I always thought they were
[5351.46s -> 5354.66s]  gonna make me do another one of those.
[5354.66s -> 5362.66s]  Oh no, they might.
[5362.66s -> 5368.55s]  Thank god.
[5368.55s -> 5374.57s]  Behind the schedule.
[5374.57s -> 5385.83s]  Who the hell is that?
[5385.83s -> 5388.01s]  See you later. Goodbye, Nancy.
[5388.01s -> 5394.34s]  Okay, see you later.
[5394.34s -> 5398.50s]  Wait, this is a Kevin McLeod zone?
[5398.50s -> 5416.04s]  Really? Let's go talk to Mr. Jim.
[5416.04s -> 5419.74s]  How's it going?
[5419.74s -> 5421.74s]  Who's Maxine?
[5421.74s -> 5423.74s]  Tell me about the robbery at the drug station
[5423.74s -> 5425.74s]  pharmacy.
[5425.74s -> 5427.74s]  Why would I know about a robbery?
[5427.74s -> 5432.09s]  All I know about is football.
[5432.09s -> 5434.09s]  I'm really sorry you got injured.
[5434.09s -> 5436.09s]  Does that affect your chances
[5436.09s -> 5438.09s]  of playing college ball?
[5438.09s -> 5440.09s]  I had a little sprain, no big deal.
[5440.09s -> 5442.09s]  Within a week, I was better than before
[5442.09s -> 5444.09s]  and impressing the football scouts.
[5444.09s -> 5446.09s]  I'm as strong as ever.
[5446.09s -> 5450.82s]  Anyone that says I'm as strong as ever
[5450.82s -> 5452.82s]  usually is about at 40%.
[5452.82s -> 5454.82s]  What can you tell me about Connie Watson?
[5454.82s -> 5456.82s]  She hangs out at the gym a lot. I heard she's been having
[5456.82s -> 5460.54s]  a real tough time.
[5460.54s -> 5462.54s]  Why do you think she hangs out at the gym so much?
[5462.54s -> 5464.54s]  I don't know.
[5464.54s -> 5466.54s]  She's a pretty good athlete, but never joined any of
[5466.54s -> 5468.97s]  Paseo Del Mar's teams.
[5468.97s -> 5470.97s]  Why not?
[5470.97s -> 5473.53s]  Not exactly sure.
[5473.53s -> 5475.53s]  You said she was having a tough time?
[5475.53s -> 5477.53s]  I heard she's been having some money problems.
[5477.53s -> 5479.53s]  Did you take the videocassette from Jake's locker?
[5479.53s -> 5481.53s]  Do you know why Jake had an empty videocassette case
[5481.53s -> 5483.53s]  in his locker?
[5483.53s -> 5485.53s]  I didn't pay much attention to Jake.
[5485.53s -> 5487.53s]  I'm tired of talking about that loser.
[5487.53s -> 5489.53s]  I'll kill you with my bare teeth.
[5489.53s -> 5491.53s]  Do you know Hal Tanaka?
[5491.53s -> 5493.53s]  That dude is always studying.
[5493.53s -> 5495.53s]  He's a huge fan of mine. Real smart guy.
[5495.53s -> 5497.53s]  But I never understood why a
[5497.53s -> 5499.53s]  brain like Tanaka would hang out with slime
[5499.53s -> 5501.53s]  like Jake.
[5501.53s -> 5503.53s]  Hal was a friend of Jake's?
[5503.53s -> 5505.53s]  Why?
[5505.53s -> 5507.53s]  Let's just say I saw them talking together a lot.
[5507.53s -> 5509.53s]  Jake's locker was right next to Hal's.
[5509.53s -> 5511.53s]  But they weren't really friends.
[5511.53s -> 5513.53s]  Is that what you're saying?
[5513.53s -> 5515.53s]  Jake didn't really have friends.
[5515.53s -> 5517.53s]  And Hal, he may seem pretty chill,
[5517.53s -> 5519.53s]  but I've seen him crack a couple of times.
[5519.53s -> 5521.53s]  He's seriously uptight.
[5521.53s -> 5523.53s]  Crack a couple of times?
[5523.53s -> 5525.53s]  He's got a temper, a bad one.
[5525.53s -> 5527.53s]  He lets the pressure build and build until
[5527.53s -> 5529.53s]  he's wound so tight the slightest thing sets him off.
[5529.53s -> 5531.53s]  Like last week, I strike him out
[5531.53s -> 5533.53s]  and he goes ballistic and charges the mount.
[5533.53s -> 5535.53s]  He's got some serious issues.
[5535.53s -> 5537.53s]  Now that I think of it,
[5537.53s -> 5539.53s]  last time I saw them together,
[5539.53s -> 5541.53s]  Hal seemed pretty upset.
[5541.53s -> 5543.53s]  Goodbye.
[5543.53s -> 5545.53s]  Well, we have new info to
[5545.53s -> 5547.53s]  bring to...
[5547.53s -> 5549.53s]  I'm not into pushy girls.
[5549.53s -> 5551.53s]  Do me a favor and bother someone else.
[5551.53s -> 5553.53s]  I'll talk to you later.
[5553.53s -> 5555.53s]  I'm going to drink a Mountain Dew
[5555.53s -> 5557.53s]  just because of that
[5557.53s -> 5564.44s]  dick.
[5564.44s -> 5566.44s]  Oh, just regular soda water.
[5566.44s -> 5575.02s]  Gross.
[5575.02s -> 5581.61s]  Who would ever buy that?
[5581.61s -> 5585.00s]  Cat puke.
[5585.00s -> 5587.75s]  Let's go talk and say,
[5587.75s -> 5589.93s]  hey, so you attacked people.
[5589.93s -> 5592.81s]  See ya.
[5592.81s -> 5595.37s]  Goodbye, Nancy.
[5595.37s -> 5597.37s]  I need a schedule.
[5597.37s -> 5601.27s]  Nancy, I'm starting to wonder about you.
[5601.27s -> 5603.27s]  Have you seen any of those weird messages
[5603.27s -> 5605.27s]  on the bulletin boards?
[5605.27s -> 5607.27s]  White Claw?
[5607.27s -> 5609.27s]  Yes, and if I catch the guy who's doing it,
[5609.27s -> 5611.27s]  I bet it's the same person who keeps on setting off
[5611.27s -> 5613.27s]  the soda machine alarm.
[5613.27s -> 5616.98s]  There's a soda machine alarm?
[5616.98s -> 5618.98s]  I guess that comes with a territory
[5618.98s -> 5620.98s]  of being a school monitor.
[5620.98s -> 5622.98s]  Normally it's not this hectic.
[5622.98s -> 5624.98s]  When I figure out who's been pulling all these pranks.
[5624.98s -> 5627.22s]  Hulk told me
[5627.22s -> 5629.22s]  money's been tight for you these days.
[5629.22s -> 5631.22s]  What a dork!
[5631.22s -> 5633.22s]  Hulk Sanch has doesn't know the first thing about my life.
[5633.22s -> 5635.22s]  He needs to get a life and stop talking
[5635.22s -> 5637.22s]  about mine.
[5637.22s -> 5639.22s]  I need to sit before these people in this room
[5639.22s -> 5641.22s]  and sit in each one of these chairs and go fucking hash it out
[5641.22s -> 5643.22s]  and walk away. Seriously.
[5643.22s -> 5645.22s]  See you later. Adios.
[5645.22s -> 5662.10s]  Bushcan?
[5662.10s -> 5664.10s]  The soda can't just be for fun.
[5664.10s -> 5671.00s]  Can it?
[5671.00s -> 5673.62s]  Looking for the schedule.
[5673.62s -> 5675.62s]  Somebody had a schedule we needed to look behind.
[5675.62s -> 5677.62s]  Maybe on a bulletin board?
[5677.62s -> 5681.83s]  Wait a minute. What's that?
[5681.83s -> 5687.40s]  Meet in the parking lot at 9 in the morning.
[5687.40s -> 5689.40s]  Pippen will take place to survey the Dresden Reservoir.
[5689.40s -> 5692.79s]  Brass set for later.
[5692.79s -> 5694.79s]  L-A-U-2.
[5694.79s -> 5701.77s]  Uh, okay.
[5701.77s -> 5707.72s]  Well, there's the U-2.
[5707.72s -> 5711.30s]  Yeah, why are there only three people in this school?
[5711.30s -> 5717.13s]  It's gonna be real easy to narrow down
[5717.13s -> 5719.13s]  who killed Jake, considering there's only
[5719.13s -> 5721.13s]  four people in the game.
[5721.13s -> 5729.51s]  It's a 25% chance to get it right.
[5729.51s -> 5738.15s]  Announcements.
[5738.15s -> 5741.29s]  Student bulletin board.
[5741.29s -> 5745.06s]  Attention. Wait.
[5745.06s -> 5747.06s]  The Roaring Girl.
[5747.06s -> 5749.62s]  A Jacobean comedy.
[5749.62s -> 5751.62s]  Talk to Deception. A poetic drama written by
[5751.62s -> 5753.62s]  the senior essay winners of
[5753.62s -> 5755.62s]  The student files under lock and key
[5755.62s -> 5757.62s]  will show the lies of the doctor to be
[5757.62s -> 5759.62s]  H-F-L-1.
[5759.62s -> 5762.50s]  I feel like this shit is important somehow.
[5762.50s -> 5782.09s]  Something about the elements?
[5782.09s -> 5786.06s]  I have no idea.
[5786.06s -> 5788.06s]  Why would I need to be, why could I look at this?
[5788.06s -> 5795.35s]  Take a picture of it?
[5795.35s -> 5799.19s]  Is there anything else I can go in town?
[5799.19s -> 5801.19s]  I feel like I'm just trapped here.
[5801.19s -> 5805.61s]  What can I do for you?
[5805.61s -> 5808.55s]  Do you know why Jake had an empty
[5808.55s -> 5810.55s]  video cassette case in his locker?
[5810.55s -> 5812.55s]  Why were you in Jake's locker?
[5812.55s -> 5816.25s]  It was
[5816.25s -> 5818.25s]  open and I just looked through it.
[5818.25s -> 5820.25s]  Oh.
[5820.25s -> 5824.98s]  I have no idea.
[5824.98s -> 5826.98s]  What else can I do for you?
[5826.98s -> 5831.02s]  Didn't I hear that you
[5831.02s -> 5833.02s]  found Jake's body?
[5833.02s -> 5835.02s]  Yeah, I did.
[5835.02s -> 5837.02s]  The student council president gets keys
[5837.02s -> 5839.02s]  to the school. We had an early morning
[5839.02s -> 5841.02s]  council meeting and
[5841.02s -> 5843.02s]  I found him lying there. It was the worst
[5843.02s -> 5845.02s]  thing I ever experienced in my life.
[5845.02s -> 5847.02s]  And I really don't want to
[5847.02s -> 5853.74s]  think about it right now.
[5853.74s -> 5855.74s]  Do you know Connie Watson?
[5855.74s -> 5857.74s]  Not that well. She keeps to herself
[5857.74s -> 5859.74s]  a lot. I've always thought
[5859.74s -> 5861.74s]  there's something mysterious about
[5861.74s -> 5863.74s]  her. Kind of the same way
[5863.74s -> 5865.74s]  I feel about you.
[5865.74s -> 5867.74s]  $1.30 for a ham sandwich?
[5867.74s -> 5870.68s]  That's pretty cool.
[5870.68s -> 5872.68s]  How well do you know Hulk Sanchez?
[5872.68s -> 5874.68s]  Big guy, big muscles,
[5874.68s -> 5876.68s]  big dreams. A lot of
[5876.68s -> 5878.68s]  football scouts have been coming over to watch and play.
[5878.68s -> 5880.68s]  He must be under a lot of pressure
[5880.68s -> 5882.68s]  to perform. What can you tell me about
[5882.68s -> 5884.68s]  Hal Tanaka?
[5884.68s -> 5886.68s]  Hal's an exchange student who's all scholarships
[5886.68s -> 5888.68s]  and study. He's very
[5888.68s -> 5890.68s]  intense about becoming a doctor.
[5890.68s -> 5892.68s]  How much ketchup can you drink in 10 seconds?
[5892.68s -> 5894.68s]  Talk to you later.
[5894.68s -> 5902.87s]  Impress me. See ya.
[5902.87s -> 5906.46s]  Can I go in the back? I didn't even
[5906.46s -> 5912.86s]  know I could go back here. That's just
[5912.86s -> 5915.10s]  very realistic. That's a pretty
[5915.10s -> 5919.19s]  realistic looking knife.
[5919.19s -> 5922.26s]  Cooking minigame, I hope so.
[5922.26s -> 5924.26s]  Payday, payday, payday, payday.
[5924.26s -> 5926.26s]  Hmm, looks like something
[5926.26s -> 5928.26s]  was removed here.
[5928.26s -> 5930.26s]  Didn't I find it in his locker? Wasn't it in the corner?
[5930.26s -> 5944.60s]  First aid? No.
[5944.60s -> 5952.28s]  He's on the schedule, yeah.
[5952.28s -> 5956.62s]  Hold on, let me see that again.
[5956.62s -> 5958.62s]  Behind, right, behind the
[5958.62s -> 5962.01s]  schedule, right?
[5962.01s -> 5964.01s]  Didn't say the clue was behind Maxine's
[5964.01s -> 5968.23s]  schedule? T-E-L-
[5968.23s -> 5971.37s]  three, where is it?
[5971.37s -> 5976.17s]  T-E-L-three.
[5976.17s -> 5978.17s]  C-ki
[5978.17s -> 5980.17s]  ichi.
[5980.17s -> 5984.52s]  What is that? What does that mean, though?
[5984.52s -> 5991.50s]  He's not looking at those edits? I'll look at
[5991.50s -> 5997.11s]  one. Pretty good.
[5997.11s -> 6003.13s]  Pretty good. What am I supposed to do with this?
[6003.13s -> 6014.44s]  Boop boop boop.
[6014.44s -> 6020.46s]  Boop boop boop. So I have it, now what?
[6020.46s -> 6030.44s]  Yeah, that's good. No, fuck off, says
[6030.44s -> 6032.44s]  German 985. When did I do
[6032.44s -> 6042.87s]  that? What does this mean?
[6042.87s -> 6048.12s]  Is that numbers?
[6048.12s -> 6050.12s]  Typed like C-E-E?
[6050.12s -> 6052.55s]  Or...
[6052.55s -> 6059.26s]  I don't know. I don't get it.
[6059.26s -> 6061.26s]  That's braille, right? But
[6061.26s -> 6064.01s]  what do I need that for?
[6064.01s -> 6067.59s]  What about the periodic table?
[6067.59s -> 6071.37s]  See ya. Farewell, Nancy.
[6071.37s -> 6074.44s]  It's Eric from High School. Remember me?
[6074.44s -> 6076.44s]  Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in English
[6076.44s -> 6078.44s]  class. Sorry, you're just an easy target.
[6078.44s -> 6080.68s]  I cannot see much to change.
[6080.68s -> 6082.68s]  Remember Jenny, the girl you had a crush on when we were
[6082.68s -> 6084.68s]  married? I now make over $200,000
[6084.68s -> 6086.68s]  a year.
[6086.68s -> 6088.68s]  And I drive a really expensive car. I guess something
[6088.68s -> 6090.68s]  never changed. Holland Loser, that's catching up. LOL
[6090.68s -> 6092.68s]  Pathetic. I made more money than you.
[6092.68s -> 6096.84s]  In the last, like,
[6096.84s -> 6099.27s]  14 days.
[6099.27s -> 6102.54s]  So, um...
[6102.54s -> 6109.26s]  Cool, good luck.
[6109.26s -> 6111.26s]  That's not even true.
[6111.26s -> 6113.26s]  I can't perpetuate that one.
[6113.26s -> 6117.86s]  That means
[6117.86s -> 6119.86s]  I make like fucking $70,000,000
[6119.86s -> 6125.37s]  a year. I need to go
[6125.37s -> 6127.37s]  to the pier- Alright, I'm about to turn it off.
[6127.37s -> 6130.82s]  I need to get- I'm gonna go- I'm- I'm-
[6130.82s -> 6132.82s]  My pizza levels are at a dangerous
[6132.82s -> 6144.58s]  level. What's that?
[6144.58s -> 6164.47s]  Wait, how do I flip it? I can't
[6164.47s -> 6173.11s]  flip it? Flip your head.
[6173.11s -> 6182.12s]  This isn't-
[6182.12s -> 6184.12s]  Nowhere to turn to, nowhere to hide.
[6184.12s -> 6186.36s]  Let the books in the
[6186.36s -> 6188.36s]  library be your answer guide.
[6188.36s -> 6191.75s]  Okay.
[6191.75s -> 6194.18s]  It- This is-
[6194.18s -> 6199.88s]  This is mirrored.
[6199.88s -> 6218.06s]  That- Hold on, it's mirrored.
[6218.06s -> 6220.36s]  Okay, got a picture.
[6220.36s -> 6222.36s]  Now, can you flip horizontally in
[6222.36s -> 6228.95s]  iPhone? You can't.
[6228.95s -> 6232.09s]  Just mirror OBS.
[6232.09s -> 6234.09s]  Oh, right, I use mirror OBS.
[6234.09s -> 6250.34s]  Uh, nowhere to turn to,
[6250.34s -> 6252.34s]  nowhere to hide. No- Wait, what?
[6252.34s -> 6261.37s]  Transform.
[6261.37s -> 6265.78s]  Flip horizontal.
[6265.78s -> 6273.59s]  That- What is going on?
[6273.59s -> 6275.59s]  That someone-
[6275.59s -> 6277.59s]  That someone must-
[6277.59s -> 6279.77s]  Why is this wrong?
[6279.77s -> 6285.59s]  The letters- It's the placement
[6285.59s -> 6287.59s]  of the letters.
[6287.59s -> 6296.42s]  That someone must
[6296.42s -> 6298.86s]  hide
[6298.86s -> 6300.86s]  reflects big
[6300.86s -> 6304.06s]  secret.
[6304.06s -> 6308.09s]  Worn with
[6308.09s -> 6310.33s]  great pride.
[6310.33s -> 6313.40s]  A symbol of
[6313.40s -> 6317.29s]  jank.
[6317.29s -> 6326.74s]  A symbol of
[6326.74s -> 6331.21s]  kanji.
[6331.21s -> 6333.21s]  Wait, the thing around her neck?
[6333.21s -> 6336.54s]  That medallion, right?
[6336.54s -> 6339.48s]  Now, what's this last one?
[6339.48s -> 6343.43s]  Took it
[6343.43s -> 6346.70s]  to bib.
[6346.70s -> 6349.32s]  I have to go eat a pizza.
[6349.32s -> 6356.42s]  Took it- Took it to
[6356.42s -> 6359.69s]  bib.
[6359.69s -> 6361.69s]  I had to- It's upside down though.
[6361.69s -> 6366.30s]  Flip it upside down.
[6366.30s -> 6370.20s]  Yeah, it's time to get a pizza.
[6370.20s -> 6374.17s]  Let me look at it here. He did what it took to make
[6374.17s -> 6376.17s]  the grade, even if it meant cheating to keep up
[6376.17s -> 6381.61s]  his charade.
[6381.61s -> 6390.06s]  Talking about me?
[6390.06s -> 6392.06s]  Alright, so we gotta talk- We gotta talk to, um,
[6392.06s -> 6394.06s]  that-
[6394.06s -> 6396.06s]  the lady in here. I'm gonna sneeze.
[6396.06s -> 6398.06s]  I can do about it.
[6398.06s -> 6403.94s]  Alright, let's go talk about the necklace.
[6403.94s -> 6409.58s]  It's almost time for me to get a pizza.
[6409.58s -> 6418.47s]  Close.
[6418.47s -> 6426.47s]  Where was she sitting again? I don't even remember.
[6426.47s -> 6429.86s]  Okay, hey, what's with the medallion?
[6436.52s -> 6451.30s]  What is this?
[6451.30s -> 6459.88s]  What does it say?
[6459.88s -> 6461.88s]  Okay, it looks like
[6461.88s -> 6463.88s]  I need to get- I wanna see.
[6463.88s -> 6466.50s]  No, I'm trying to get a picture of the medallion!
[6466.50s -> 6468.50s]  Oh my god.
[6470.50s -> 6478.89s]  What does this mean, too?
[6485.99s -> 6487.99s]  Probably get rid of you so I can go in here.
[6487.99s -> 6491.32s]  You're eating pizza right now?
[6491.32s -> 6496.25s]  I've never been more jealous in my whole life.
[6496.25s -> 6500.02s]  What kind of pizza is it, though?
[6500.02s -> 6502.52s]  Talk to me.
[6502.52s -> 6508.01s]  Best pizza on Earth
[6508.01s -> 6510.01s]  is very, very thin,
[6510.01s -> 6512.25s]  crispy, thin crust.
[6512.25s -> 6514.25s]  And I'm talking paper thin.
[6514.25s -> 6516.25s]  Pepperoni pizza.
[6516.25s -> 6518.25s]  That's it. Don't put any of the junk on it.
[6518.25s -> 6520.49s]  Just a super thin,
[6520.49s -> 6522.49s]  crispy pepperoni pizza.
[6522.49s -> 6528.38s]  I don't want anything else on it.
[6528.38s -> 6530.87s]  Don't load it up with hamburger meat
[6530.87s -> 6533.05s]  and onions and garlic and bacon
[6533.05s -> 6535.05s]  and salami.
[6535.05s -> 6537.67s]  Because then it's not a pizza anymore.
[6537.67s -> 6539.67s]  You're eating
[6539.67s -> 6541.67s]  spaghetti and meatballs
[6541.67s -> 6545.64s]  at that point.
[6545.64s -> 6553.58s]  You might as well just put it all in a bowl and eat it out of a bowl.
[6553.58s -> 6555.75s]  Because the thing just falls apart.
[6555.75s -> 6557.75s]  If you get a meatlovers pizza, don't eat
[6557.75s -> 6559.75s]  meatlovers pizza, seriously.
[6559.75s -> 6563.64s]  They're just making a joke.
[6563.64s -> 6565.64s]  Because you pick it up and you lift it up
[6565.64s -> 6567.64s]  and it goes- here, I'll give you an example.
[6567.64s -> 6570.26s]  So you pick up a piece of pizza that's
[6570.26s -> 6572.26s]  meatlovers, right? I just picked it up.
[6572.26s -> 6574.26s]  This is the top. This is the crust.
[6574.26s -> 6576.26s]  So I pick it up and it goes like this.
[6576.26s -> 6578.26s]  And everything just falls off into the plate.
[6578.26s -> 6580.26s]  And then you go, oh shit, oh well.
[6580.26s -> 6582.26s]  Looks like I'm eating a piece of wet paper
[6582.26s -> 6585.85s]  with spaghetti sauce on it.
[6585.85s -> 6587.85s]  What's that down there?
[6587.85s -> 6589.85s]  The shit that I paid for? I'll eat it with a fork later.
[6589.85s -> 6604.87s]  You have to fold it.
[6604.87s -> 6606.87s]  Oh, sure. Let me go ahead and
[6606.87s -> 6608.87s]  let me fold the pizza now.
[6608.87s -> 6610.87s]  Let's fold it in half. And then when I bite into it,
[6610.87s -> 6612.87s]  like this,
[6612.87s -> 6614.87s]  all the toppings mush out
[6614.87s -> 6616.87s]  into my face and go all over me
[6616.87s -> 6618.87s]  and burn the fuck out of me.
[6618.87s -> 6620.87s]  Like, ow! And it falls down
[6620.87s -> 6622.87s]  on the plate and there it goes again.
[6622.87s -> 6625.50s]  If you- no, don't say we.
[6625.50s -> 6627.50s]  That's why I didn't do it, because I had touched it.
[6627.50s -> 6630.76s]  If you fold a pizza that has a ton of toppings on it,
[6630.76s -> 6632.76s]  all the toppings just mush out out of the top.
[6632.76s -> 6643.96s]  He's never eaten- do I have to
[6643.96s -> 6645.96s]  order a meatlovers pizza and eat it?
[6645.96s -> 6648.39s]  To show you that-
[6648.39s -> 6650.70s]  where are you getting your meatlovers pizzas?
[6650.70s -> 6659.27s]  They're loaded with toppings!
[6659.27s -> 6663.94s]  You're a crackhead. You don't eat tacos.
[6663.94s -> 6665.94s]  Tacos are messy too, but they're good.
[6665.94s -> 6667.94s]  No, I'm not doing it on stream right now.
[6667.94s -> 6669.94s]  Alright, fine. How about this? I promise.
[6669.94s -> 6671.94s]  Listen, time stamp this.
[6671.94s -> 6674.18s]  I will eat
[6674.18s -> 6676.74s]  a big meatlovers pizza.
[6676.74s -> 6678.74s]  Not the whole thing, but just enough for me to prove
[6678.74s -> 6680.74s]  that they're a fucking mess.
[6680.74s -> 6684.52s]  Not tomorrow. We're doing Normal Heroes tomorrow.
[6684.52s -> 6687.02s]  It'll be its own stream.
[6687.02s -> 6689.02s]  The stream will just be titled
[6689.02s -> 6691.02s]  Dickhead Eats a Pizza
[6691.02s -> 6705.86s]  to prove a non-existent point.
[6705.86s -> 6707.86s]  Alright, see you tomorrow. I'm out.
[6707.86s -> 6709.86s]  I'm going to get a pizza.
[6709.86s -> 6711.86s]  I'm going to get a pizza. Now we talked about it. Now I want one.
[6711.86s -> 6723.26s]  Boo, boo, boo.
[6723.26s -> 6725.26s]  Five hour stream because
[6725.26s -> 6728.20s]  Hungry Boomer. No.
[6728.20s -> 6730.20s]  Five hour stream because I couldn't get
[6730.20s -> 6732.20s]  no more heroes to work.
[6732.20s -> 6734.20s]  I still have- I thought this was a good one.
[6734.20s -> 6736.20s]  I had a lot of fun playing Nancy Drew.
[6736.20s -> 6738.20s]  Maybe not this one, but the last one. Eh, this one too.
[6738.20s -> 6740.20s]  At least first- I liked it.
[6740.20s -> 6742.70s]  But we keep talking.
[6742.70s -> 6744.70s]  You guys messed it up. You talked about pizza too many times.
[6744.70s -> 6746.70s]  The second you bring up pizza, I'm going to leave. You know that, right?
[6751.07s -> 6753.07s]  If you guys want
[6753.07s -> 6755.07s]  more than, you know, six, seven hour streams,
[6755.07s -> 6757.07s]  don't say the word pizza in the chat.
[6757.07s -> 6759.95s]  How many times have I looked over here
[6759.95s -> 6761.95s]  when someone's like, oh man, I really want a pizza tonight.
[6761.95s -> 6763.95s]  And I go, oh cool, me too.
[6763.95s -> 6768.69s]  And the stream ends in like 40 minutes.
[6768.69s -> 6770.69s]  That's happened at least three or four times in the last six months.
[6775.23s -> 6777.23s]  It's our fault.
[6777.23s -> 6779.60s]  What topping should I get? I told you.
[6779.60s -> 6781.90s]  Pepperoni.
[6781.90s -> 6784.78s]  Cheese with the nice
[6784.78s -> 6786.78s]  tangy sauce. Crispy.
[6786.78s -> 6788.78s]  It's gotta be crispy.
[6788.78s -> 6790.78s]  It's gotta be crispy.
[6790.78s -> 6792.78s]  None of this folded.
[6792.78s -> 6794.78s]  No, no, no. I want it when I bite into it to sound like
[6794.78s -> 6796.78s]  a fucking goddamn potato chip
[6796.78s -> 6798.78s]  cartoon commercial.
[6798.78s -> 6808.06s]  I want to bite into that crust
[6808.06s -> 6810.50s]  and have it be like
[6810.50s -> 6816.90s]  this. I don't like doughy
[6816.90s -> 6821.57s]  ass pizza. I want it to be like
[6821.57s -> 6835.33s]  this. Maybe, okay, maybe not-
[6835.33s -> 6837.33s]  that's not like someone chewing on sand. Maybe not
[6837.33s -> 6846.67s]  that crunchy. Dude, people-
[6846.67s -> 6849.42s]  Here's another thing that's weird.
[6849.42s -> 6851.42s]  It is 50-50 split
[6851.42s -> 6854.11s]  whether or not people
[6854.11s -> 6856.11s]  want to instantly throw up when they-
[6856.11s -> 6858.11s]  like somebody crunching
[6858.11s -> 6860.11s]  on something is instant-
[6860.11s -> 6862.11s]  instantaneous.
[6862.11s -> 6864.11s]  Just vile
[6864.11s -> 6866.42s]  reaction. And then there are other people that go,
[6866.42s -> 6871.92s]  oh, do that again.
[6871.92s -> 6873.92s]  I remember I was eating chocolate one time
[6873.92s -> 6875.92s]  on stream. This is like three- I don't know why I remember this.
[6875.92s -> 6877.92s]  This is like three years ago. And I was eating
[6877.92s -> 6879.92s]  Reese's chocolate or something.
[6879.92s -> 6882.93s]  And there was like
[6882.93s -> 6884.93s]  at least a bunch of people- there was a bunch of people that were saying
[6884.93s -> 6886.93s]  dude, you're fucking disgusting.
[6886.93s -> 6888.93s]  Like stop- I don't want to hear that.
[6888.93s -> 6900.70s]  And I had to mute a bunch of times.
[6900.70s -> 6906.21s]  Was that a dream? No, it wasn't.
[6906.21s -> 6912.42s]  Chew with- I was.
[6912.42s -> 6914.42s]  I swear to god.
[6920.10s -> 6926.24s]  Mute your mic while you eat.
[6926.24s -> 6928.24s]  Nah, nah, nah, nah.
[6928.24s -> 6930.24s]  I'm gonna put the can on this one tonight. We're gonna start
[6930.24s -> 6935.62s]  No More Heroes tomorrow.
[6935.62s -> 6937.62s]  The viewers are dying. Well, I did-
[6937.62s -> 6941.14s]  I did just say the stream was over.
[6941.14s -> 6943.14s]  No More Heroes starts tomorrow. We're going- we're going four days in a row, by the way.
[6943.14s -> 6945.14s]  I didn't- did I mention that?
[6945.14s -> 6949.30s]  I don't think I did.
[6949.30s -> 6951.30s]  The reason why I didn't stream the last three, four days in a row
[6951.30s -> 6953.30s]  is because I was getting the New Year's Eve stuff ready.
[6953.30s -> 6955.30s]  And that stuff is almost all ready.
[6955.30s -> 6957.60s]  So we can just go four days in a row.
[6957.60s -> 6959.60s]  You'll have No More Heroes tomorrow,
[6959.60s -> 6961.60s]  maybe No More Heroes again, depending on if I
[6961.60s -> 6963.60s]  do that on Monday. And then New Year's Eve
[6963.60s -> 6965.60s]  stream on 31st.
[6965.60s -> 6973.28s]  More Nancy. I don't think
[6973.28s -> 6975.28s]  there'll be time for it tomorrow or the next day.
[6975.28s -> 6978.54s]  Maybe I'll get a pizza on New Year's.
[6978.54s -> 6980.54s]  That's not a bad idea. What a good idea.
[6980.54s -> 6982.78s]  Alright, fine. I'll get- I'll get a pizza
[6982.78s -> 6985.22s]  and I'm gonna eat it on stream.
[6985.22s -> 6987.22s]  I'm gonna get burnt. I already know it. Alright, I gotta be careful
[6987.22s -> 6989.22s]  on that one. Alright guys, I'll see you
[6989.22s -> 6991.22s]  tomorrow. Thanks for sticking around.
[6991.22s -> 6993.39s]  Now we're gonna go over the
[6993.39s -> 6995.39s]  subs and bits and everything, so don't worry.
[6995.39s -> 7002.82s]  And stick around if you want.
[7002.82s -> 7004.82s]  Sort of an impromptu Nancy Drew stream because
[7004.82s -> 7006.82s]  last second I couldn't get my Wiimote
[7006.82s -> 7008.82s]  to work, but it's kinda
[7008.82s -> 7010.99s]  what I plan on doing tomorrow.
[7010.99s -> 7012.99s]  Is making sure I can get it to function.
[7012.99s -> 7015.74s]  If I can't, then we're just gonna have
[7015.74s -> 7017.74s]  to boot up the old Wii.
[7017.74s -> 7024.26s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a great
[7024.26s -> 7028.29s]  night. Those of you sticking around,
[7028.29s -> 7037.30s]  let's talk about bits.
[7037.30s -> 7040.30s]  Shall we? Uh,
[7040.30s -> 7042.30s]  Melatonin Dream Boy, thanks for the 500 bits.
[7042.30s -> 7045.57s]  Uh, no message, just
[7045.57s -> 7048.70s]  500 bits, thank you. Uh, thank you
[7048.70s -> 7050.70s]  Heavymen for the 300 bits. No More Heroes is
[7050.70s -> 7052.70s]  one of my favorite franchises.
[7052.70s -> 7054.70s]  And I'd be sure happy to see you play it.
[7054.70s -> 7056.70s]  I'd recommend playing the Wii versions
[7056.70s -> 7058.70s]  on the original hardware since they can be both
[7058.70s -> 7060.70s]  up for like 10 bucks.
[7060.70s -> 7062.70s]  Uh, never experienced emulating it though.
[7062.70s -> 7064.70s]  Also, difficulty is really not that bad on normal mode
[7064.70s -> 7066.70s]  and the controls are easier to control on the Wii mode than you think.
[7066.70s -> 7068.70s]  You can also use the Wii Classic controller
[7068.70s -> 7070.70s]  if you don't want to deal with the motion controls.
[7070.70s -> 7072.70s]  Uh, I've, I played No More Heroes 1
[7072.70s -> 7074.70s]  and 2 a long time ago.
[7074.70s -> 7076.70s]  Uh, I love these games.
[7076.70s -> 7078.70s]  They're a little janky and a little wonky.
[7078.70s -> 7080.70s]  But, um,
[7080.70s -> 7082.70s]  I wanted to
[7082.70s -> 7087.30s]  do them both,
[7087.30s -> 7089.30s]  but I didn't want to split it
[7089.30s -> 7091.30s]  up to do PS3 because it's a better version
[7091.30s -> 7093.30s]  and runs better and then go to Wii
[7093.30s -> 7095.30s]  and it runs like crap. And I'd rather
[7095.30s -> 7097.30s]  them just both be
[7097.30s -> 7099.73s]  um, streamed
[7099.73s -> 7106.06s]  through the PC. Because I can make the resolution
[7106.06s -> 7108.06s]  better, I can make it look a lot better
[7108.06s -> 7110.06s]  because the Wii version, I know we were
[7110.06s -> 7112.06s]  we were memeing
[7112.06s -> 7114.06s]  on, um,
[7114.06s -> 7116.69s]  the original version. But it
[7116.69s -> 7118.69s]  really does run like crap
[7118.69s -> 7120.69s]  in a lot of places from what I remember.
[7120.69s -> 7122.69s]  If you hit somebody with your, uh,
[7122.69s -> 7124.69s]  blade and their blood blows up
[7124.69s -> 7126.69s]  out of their head, I remember it specifically
[7126.69s -> 7128.69s]  chugging down to like 10 frames a second
[7128.69s -> 7130.69s]  half the time. So
[7130.69s -> 7133.18s]  I'd like to run it in his best
[7133.18s -> 7135.18s]  way to present it to people.
[7135.18s -> 7137.18s]  The PS3 runs
[7137.18s -> 7139.18s]  worse like crap, really. Well then they
[7139.18s -> 7141.18s]  both do. So then even better reason
[7141.18s -> 7143.18s]  to not stream it on original hardware.
[7143.18s -> 7147.34s]  Because I did walk around
[7147.34s -> 7149.34s]  in it very, very briefly.
[7149.34s -> 7151.34s]  And it seems to run pretty well
[7151.34s -> 7153.34s]  on the settings I have now on PC.
[7153.34s -> 7156.16s]  Through emulation.
[7156.16s -> 7159.36s]  Riding the bike through town will be rough. Yeah,
[7159.36s -> 7163.97s]  it always is though. Uh, but
[7163.97s -> 7165.97s]  yeah, it's, um,
[7165.97s -> 7167.97s]  it should be a great experience. It's a really fun game. It's a really
[7167.97s -> 7172.06s]  interesting game. I'm looking
[7172.06s -> 7174.06s]  forward to it. To return to it again.
[7174.06s -> 7176.94s]  Uh, Heavymin.
[7176.94s -> 7180.59s]  That was you. Thank you
[7180.59s -> 7182.59s]  again for 300 bits. I don't know why it does
[7182.59s -> 7184.59s]  this sometimes. Like I lose, there it is.
[7184.59s -> 7188.24s]  Thank you. Hate
[7188.24s -> 7190.24s]  sucks. Hate
[7190.24s -> 7192.24s]  sucks. No, it was me. It was
[7192.24s -> 7194.24s]  not you. Uh, thanks for the thousand
[7194.24s -> 7196.24s]  bits, hate. They say DruCru. That's
[7196.24s -> 7198.24s]  right. It was the last minute DruCru.
[7198.24s -> 7202.34s]  Thank you so much for the
[7202.34s -> 7204.34s]  ten dollars thousand bits from hate.
[7204.34s -> 7208.37s]  Dark Souls, thanks for the 250
[7208.37s -> 7210.37s]  bits. Do you think one day we'll get a lifting
[7210.37s -> 7212.37s]  stream where you do a workout set?
[7212.37s -> 7214.37s]  Uh, like getting slimed for
[7214.37s -> 7216.37s]  doing something chat predicts. Assuming the doctors
[7216.37s -> 7218.37s]  can put your Humpty Dumpty streamer back together
[7218.37s -> 7221.63s]  well enough.
[7221.63s -> 7223.63s]  Uh, probably not for a while. I, I have
[7223.63s -> 7225.63s]  to get 20, okay,
[7225.63s -> 7227.63s]  2020 is the year for me.
[7227.63s -> 7230.19s]  Is what I'm gonna be doing
[7230.19s -> 7232.19s]  physical therapy. I have to
[7232.19s -> 7234.19s]  figure out what's going on with my body.
[7234.19s -> 7236.82s]  2020 is the
[7236.82s -> 7239.57s]  get healthy year. It's not like
[7239.57s -> 7241.57s]  I've been living an unhealthy lifestyle or anything.
[7241.57s -> 7243.57s]  It's just for some reason a lot of things have compounded
[7243.57s -> 7245.57s]  on top of each other.
[7245.57s -> 7247.57s]  The last year. So I
[7247.57s -> 7249.57s]  am gonna do everything necessary to get
[7249.57s -> 7251.57s]  100% healthy again.
[7251.57s -> 7254.06s]  And whatever that means, whatever procedures
[7254.06s -> 7256.06s]  or treatments or therapy that I
[7256.06s -> 7258.06s]  have to do for
[7258.06s -> 7260.06s]  my rib cage or whatever
[7260.06s -> 7262.06s]  the fuck is wrong with me and my hernia.
[7262.06s -> 7264.06s]  I might just have surgery. I might just
[7264.06s -> 7266.88s]  go do it.
[7266.88s -> 7268.88s]  A hiatal hernia doesn't go away.
[7268.88s -> 7270.88s]  It gets
[7270.88s -> 7273.25s]  worse until you get surgery.
[7273.25s -> 7275.62s]  So I might just go do
[7275.62s -> 7278.88s]  it, just get it over with. The surgery
[7278.88s -> 7280.88s]  is a simple procedure. It's
[7280.88s -> 7282.88s]  fine in like four days
[7282.88s -> 7285.82s]  or something. Cause I feel like there's a bunch
[7285.82s -> 7287.82s]  of issues that are kind of stacking on top
[7287.82s -> 7290.45s]  of each other. But we'll find out.
[7290.45s -> 7293.90s]  I have a couple of appointments coming up.
[7293.90s -> 7295.90s]  And then we'll talk about maybe doing
[7295.90s -> 7300.38s]  some more of that stuff. We'll see.
[7300.38s -> 7304.21s]  But appreciate the 250.
[7304.21s -> 7306.21s]  Fitty. Thanks for the 500 bits, Fitty.
[7306.21s -> 7308.58s]  Hey, Jerma, this site shows your
[7308.58s -> 7310.58s]  net worth. Can you give me some investment
[7310.58s -> 7313.65s]  advice? You seem
[7313.65s -> 7315.65s]  to be quite successful. Worth of the
[7315.65s -> 7321.66s]  web. What the fuck is this?
[7321.66s -> 7323.66s]  How much is
[7323.66s -> 7325.66s]  youtube.com slash user slash
[7325.66s -> 7328.03s]  Jerma985 worth? You can
[7328.03s -> 7330.03s]  find the estimated website value for
[7330.03s -> 7332.03s]  Jerma985 in US dollars.
[7332.03s -> 7335.87s]  What is it? Oh.
[7335.87s -> 7337.87s]  102 billion dollars.
[7337.87s -> 7341.84s]  102 billion
[7341.84s -> 7343.84s]  650 million dollars.
[7343.84s -> 7358.03s]  Wow. That's pretty good.
[7358.03s -> 7361.04s]  How much is amazon.com
[7361.04s -> 7363.54s]  worth? Amazon
[7363.54s -> 7367.89s]  dot com. Okay.
[7367.89s -> 7371.54s]  Amazon.com is worth
[7371.54s -> 7375.44s]  4.8 billion dollars.
[7375.44s -> 7380.43s]  That's cool with me.
[7380.43s -> 7382.43s]  I'm okay being worth
[7382.43s -> 7384.43s]  like 50 Amazons.
[7384.43s -> 7395.06s]  Buy Amazon now.
[7395.06s -> 7400.56s]  Dude, that guy from English class.
[7400.56s -> 7402.56s]  Yeah, that guy from English class. Ain't got nothing
[7402.56s -> 7404.56s]  on me. Did you see that website?
[7406.93s -> 7413.52s]  Yeah, man. I got 200k.
[7413.52s -> 7415.52s]  I got this awesome
[7415.52s -> 7417.52s]  life. What about you?
[7417.52s -> 7419.52s]  Hey, I'm worth 102 billion dollars.
[7419.52s -> 7423.23s]  Mr. English class.
[7423.23s -> 7430.59s]  That's wild though. I don't even know
[7430.59s -> 7432.59s]  how is it even calculating that?
[7432.59s -> 7435.47s]  Little Wolfie. Thanks for the 850. Cheating
[7435.47s -> 7437.47s]  bits. 850 bits from Little Wolfie.
[7437.47s -> 7440.03s]  Is that bits because
[7440.03s -> 7442.03s]  I cheated or bits for me to not cheat?
[7442.03s -> 7452.08s]  I wonder. Jerma.org is only
[7452.08s -> 7454.08s]  worth 150 dollars.
[7454.08s -> 7459.07s]  It was a bit bounty.
[7459.07s -> 7468.98s]  Thank you.
[7468.98s -> 7470.98s]  Thank you Lula. Lula
[7470.98s -> 7472.98s]  Moore for the thousand bits. Ten bucks.
[7472.98s -> 7474.98s]  Hey, Jerma. I've been a long time sub and
[7474.98s -> 7476.98s]  fan. I was watching YouTube with my son
[7476.98s -> 7478.98s]  the other day and without being prompted
[7478.98s -> 7480.98s]  he asked to watch some of your videos.
[7480.98s -> 7482.98s]  He said, Jerma is amazing.
[7482.98s -> 7484.98s]  He's so hilarious. I wish I could be that funny
[7484.98s -> 7486.98s]  someday. I just thought it was cute
[7486.98s -> 7488.98s]  and a testament to your content that me, a 34
[7488.98s -> 7490.98s]  year old mom boomer
[7490.98s -> 7492.98s]  and my kid both
[7492.98s -> 7494.98s]  think you're hilarious. P.S.
[7494.98s -> 7496.98s]  He peed his pants from laughing.
[7496.98s -> 7498.98s]  It was gross. Love the stream
[7498.98s -> 7502.11s]  and content. Happy New Year.
[7502.11s -> 7508.96s]  Happy New Year to you as well. He's
[7508.96s -> 7512.93s]  so hilarious. I gotta
[7512.93s -> 7515.23s]  stop swearing. I gotta stop swearing.
[7515.23s -> 7517.23s]  Think of the children. You know what I mean?
[7517.23s -> 7519.23s]  And I gotta stop pretending to
[7519.23s -> 7521.23s]  stand up over my desk and pee into a cup.
[7521.23s -> 7523.23s]  You know, I just have to figure that
[7523.23s -> 7528.35s]  out too. I gotta clean my act up
[7528.35s -> 7535.33s]  a little bit. That will literally never
[7535.33s -> 7537.33s]  happen. If you think I'm smart enough to be able to put a
[7537.33s -> 7539.33s]  filter on some of the things that I say,
[7539.33s -> 7541.33s]  you're sadly mistaken.
[7541.33s -> 7543.63s]  I tried it. I tried it
[7543.63s -> 7546.38s]  for like a year or two. Didn't work.
[7546.38s -> 7550.86s]  Dude, he's got no filter.
[7550.86s -> 7552.86s]  I say what I want.
[7552.86s -> 7556.06s]  No filter. That's when
[7556.06s -> 7558.06s]  like every single person in the audience, their eyes
[7558.06s -> 7560.06s]  just rolled in the back of their head all the way to the
[7560.06s -> 7567.17s]  back. But no, thank you, Lula.
[7567.17s -> 7569.60s]  I appreciate it. I'm also
[7569.60s -> 7571.60s]  a 34-year-old boomer, so
[7571.60s -> 7578.69s]  he's unhinged.
[7578.69s -> 7580.93s]  Thank you. DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[7580.93s -> 7582.93s]  Checking in from Gap Gaming again.
[7582.93s -> 7584.93s]  Really great job with our testing.
[7584.93s -> 7586.93s]  With testing our anti-ad gimmick
[7586.93s -> 7588.93s]  last time. You really got your chat going.
[7588.93s -> 7590.93s]  Any Gappers?
[7590.93s -> 7592.93s]  That said, it is concerning to
[7592.93s -> 7594.93s]  us that you can't seem to beat a game made
[7594.93s -> 7596.93s]  for three-year-olds. We'll have to dock some points
[7596.93s -> 7598.93s]  for that in your upcoming review.
[7598.93s -> 7600.93s]  Hope you get better, you dumb
[7600.93s -> 7602.93s]  idiot streamer.
[7602.93s -> 7604.93s]  Thank you, Gapp.
[7604.93s -> 7610.05s]  Appreciate it. No, that's
[7610.05s -> 7612.05s]  DarkSoul. That's DarkSoul9669.
[7612.05s -> 7614.05s]  Your name's not Gapp.
[7614.05s -> 7618.40s]  Max, a disaster
[7618.40s -> 7620.40s]  thanks for the 500 bits.
[7620.40s -> 7623.92s]  Alright, Jermit, just want to thank you for streaming today. My mother was
[7623.92s -> 7625.92s]  just diagnosed with multiple
[7625.92s -> 7627.92s]  myeloma.
[7627.92s -> 7629.92s]  Myeloma? It's a blood
[7629.92s -> 7631.92s]  plasma cancer that affects bones.
[7631.92s -> 7633.92s]  So I'm glad I have your
[7633.92s -> 7635.92s]  LUL moments to take my mind off things.
[7635.92s -> 7637.92s]  Here's five bucks to show my appreciation
[7637.92s -> 7639.92s]  for your Twitch funny man endeavors.
[7639.92s -> 7642.61s]  Thanks.
[7642.61s -> 7644.61s]  I'm really, really sorry to hear that.
[7644.61s -> 7649.98s]  I don't know, I'm not sure what
[7649.98s -> 7651.98s]  stage or what
[7651.98s -> 7655.38s]  how far along that is.
[7655.38s -> 7657.38s]  But hopefully
[7657.38s -> 7663.65s]  it's very treatable. You do what you
[7663.65s -> 7666.14s]  can, right? Thank you so much.
[7666.14s -> 7668.14s]  I wish the absolute best
[7668.14s -> 7678.38s]  for your mother. Glad to have
[7678.38s -> 7684.91s]  you. Cancer sucks.
[7684.91s -> 7688.88s]  If I could seriously just go like this
[7688.88s -> 7690.88s]  and get rid of it. Oh, I would do it a hundred times.
[7690.88s -> 7692.88s]  Everybody would.
[7692.88s -> 7694.88s]  Just one of those stupid fucking illnesses that
[7694.88s -> 7697.18s]  we still can't
[7697.18s -> 7701.47s]  seem to figure out, you know?
[7701.47s -> 7710.56s]  But a lot of it is treatable. All the best
[7710.56s -> 7712.56s]  to you and your mother.
[7712.56s -> 7717.62s]  Thank you for the five dollars.
[7717.62s -> 7724.66s]  Shitty viewbot thanks for the 500 bits.
[7724.66s -> 7726.66s]  Not like this, not like this, not like this.
[7726.66s -> 7728.66s]  Drugs are bad. Was that when I was pretending
[7728.66s -> 7735.50s]  that I was on drugs?
[7735.50s -> 7737.50s]  Oh, I mean, we can talk about this very
[7737.50s -> 7739.50s]  briefly now if you want.
[7739.50s -> 7741.50s]  I think I haven't talked about it
[7741.50s -> 7743.50s]  really that much at all.
[7743.50s -> 7746.26s]  But one of the reasons why
[7746.26s -> 7748.26s]  the rumble has not been done
[7748.26s -> 7750.82s]  yet is because
[7750.82s -> 7753.18s]  the next
[7753.18s -> 7755.18s]  rumble is going to be
[7755.18s -> 7757.42s]  a charity event.
[7757.42s -> 7759.42s]  And all the money that that stream takes
[7759.42s -> 7761.42s]  in, whether it's bits or
[7761.42s -> 7763.42s]  subs, whatever money that that stream takes in
[7763.42s -> 7765.42s]  that day,
[7765.42s -> 7767.42s]  is going to go and sponsor
[7767.42s -> 7769.42s]  a good friend of mine's
[7769.42s -> 7771.42s]  Boston Marathon run.
[7771.42s -> 7773.60s]  And all that money is going to
[7773.60s -> 7775.60s]  go to a, I believe, a pediatric
[7775.60s -> 7777.60s]  cancer ward in Boston.
[7777.60s -> 7783.22s]  So we're trying to figure
[7783.22s -> 7785.22s]  out maybe some fun things to do.
[7785.22s -> 7791.17s]  But that's part of the plan.
[7791.17s -> 7800.32s]  Have him run in
[7800.32s -> 7802.32s]  blue man attire. We've been
[7802.32s -> 7804.32s]  talking about ideas of
[7804.32s -> 7806.50s]  essentially we're going to have
[7806.50s -> 7808.50s]  him be a character in the rumble.
[7808.50s -> 7810.50s]  And whatever he has in clothes,
[7810.50s -> 7812.50s]  we're going to have him run in those clothes
[7812.50s -> 7814.50s]  and I'm going to have him take some video.
[7814.50s -> 7816.67s]  This should be fun.
[7816.67s -> 7821.73s]  He's going to be a new original
[7821.73s -> 7827.49s]  character. He's just like, yeah,
[7827.49s -> 7829.49s]  I'll do, that'll be fun. I just want to make
[7829.49s -> 7831.49s]  sure I can actually run in whatever it
[7831.49s -> 7833.49s]  is. And it's like, don't worry, I'll take care of you.
[7833.49s -> 7843.09s]  And the way that it's set up, it's actually
[7843.09s -> 7845.09s]  should be pretty easy because
[7845.09s -> 7847.90s]  there's specific, there's
[7847.90s -> 7849.90s]  going to be a specific website that is linked
[7849.90s -> 7852.08s]  directly to the charity.
[7852.08s -> 7854.08s]  So the money,
[7854.08s -> 7856.08s]  I can, from everything that comes in in that stream,
[7856.08s -> 7858.08s]  I can just put it directly in
[7858.08s -> 7860.08s]  to that website.
[7860.08s -> 7864.50s]  So it's not like, oh, I'm going to
[7864.50s -> 7866.50s]  just make all this money on Twitch and then
[7866.50s -> 7868.50s]  then I'll figure it out later.
[7868.50s -> 7870.50s]  No, it'll be, there'll be plenty of avenues
[7870.50s -> 7872.50s]  to get that figured out.
[7872.50s -> 7875.25s]  It'll be live action, it will not.
[7875.25s -> 7881.25s]  But that's the plan.
[7881.25s -> 7883.25s]  Because the marathon is in April.
[7883.25s -> 7885.25s]  So I want to do it a little bit
[7885.25s -> 7887.25s]  before that, obviously, to make sure
[7887.25s -> 7889.25s]  because it's to essentially sponsor
[7889.25s -> 7891.62s]  is run. Or at least to contribute
[7891.62s -> 7893.62s]  what I, in this
[7893.62s -> 7895.62s]  community, can, right?
[7895.62s -> 7902.90s]  We'll see.
[7902.90s -> 7904.90s]  But thank you to Jim, Jim
[7904.90s -> 7906.90s]  Poe for the 300 bits.
[7906.90s -> 7909.52s]  Somewhere in January.
[7909.52s -> 7911.52s]  When it's
[7911.52s -> 7914.27s]  ready. It will be
[7914.27s -> 7916.27s]  absolutely before March.
[7916.27s -> 7927.02s]  Let's just put it that way.
[7927.02s -> 7929.84s]  Before March.
[7929.84s -> 7931.84s]  But thank you Jim, thanks for the 300 bits.
[7931.84s -> 7933.84s]  No message. Tar Alephren
[7933.84s -> 7935.84s]  thanks for the 253.
[7935.84s -> 7937.84s]  Jim's use of a guide in the stream invalidates
[7937.84s -> 7939.84s]  all prior alleged accomplishments
[7939.84s -> 7941.84s]  on stream. How can we be sure
[7941.84s -> 7943.84s]  this guy didn't use a guide in all three
[7943.84s -> 7945.84s]  Dark Souls and Sekiro?
[7945.84s -> 7949.02s]  Um, here's
[7949.02s -> 7951.02s]  your rebuttal here. I played
[7951.02s -> 7953.02s]  Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro
[7953.02s -> 7955.52s]  when they launched.
[7955.52s -> 7957.52s]  I played Sekiro the day it came out.
[7957.52s -> 7959.52s]  There's no guide. What guide existed on
[7959.52s -> 7961.52s]  day zero? I played it when it
[7961.52s -> 7966.19s]  came out.
[7966.19s -> 7968.19s]  One day had gone by and nobody even had
[7968.19s -> 7976.58s]  beaten the game. You don't have
[7976.58s -> 7980.54s]  any witnesses. Guides
[7980.54s -> 7982.54s]  came out pre-release. You think I was flipping
[7982.54s -> 7984.54s]  through
[7984.54s -> 7986.54s]  the shit that they sell at GameStop?
[7986.54s -> 7988.54s]  That's as big as an encyclopedia with the pictures?
[7988.54s -> 8000.13s]  All prior
[8000.13s -> 8002.37s]  accomplishments.
[8002.37s -> 8004.37s]  Sorry I wanted to, uh,
[8004.37s -> 8006.37s]  keep
[8006.37s -> 8008.37s]  the Nancy Drew stream
[8008.37s -> 8010.37s]  on track.
[8010.37s -> 8012.61s]  All prior
[8012.61s -> 8014.61s]  accomplishments are null.
[8014.61s -> 8018.13s]  Oh, he's stuttering. He's stuttering.
[8018.13s -> 8021.97s]  He's stuttering. Hey, little kitty,
[8021.97s -> 8023.97s]  thanks for the 500 bits. They say good job.
[8023.97s -> 8026.53s]  Thank you. Hey, you did a good job
[8026.53s -> 8028.53s]  too, in whatever you did today.
[8028.53s -> 8035.68s]  Thank you. Influx meme,
[8035.68s -> 8037.68s]  thanks for the 300 bits.
[8037.68s -> 8040.30s]  Uh, this is a two-part message.
[8040.30s -> 8043.38s]  This is the second part of my message.
[8043.38s -> 8047.54s]  Oh, I see what you're saying here. Okay.
[8047.54s -> 8049.54s]  Uh, just want to say your huge
[8049.54s -> 8051.54s]  influence you've had in my life as I
[8051.54s -> 8053.54s]  approach my twenties. Your videos and
[8053.54s -> 8055.54s]  streams have always brought me comfort whenever times
[8055.54s -> 8057.54s]  have been tough, and your unique brand of comedy has influenced
[8057.54s -> 8059.54s]  the stuff I like so much you have no idea.
[8059.54s -> 8061.78s]  I know you've probably heard this stuff
[8061.78s -> 8063.78s]  before, but you really have a huge impact on your viewers.
[8063.78s -> 8065.78s]  And I get to germ a heart
[8065.78s -> 8067.78s]  with this absolute chad of a man.
[8067.78s -> 8076.85s]  Uh,
[8076.85s -> 8078.85s]  I really appreciate that. That's
[8078.85s -> 8081.34s]  there's a lot of nice things to say
[8081.34s -> 8084.54s]  about somebody. And then you say
[8084.54s -> 8086.54s]  one of your early TF2 Q&A
[8086.54s -> 8088.54s]  videos you were initially going to delete your
[8088.54s -> 8090.54s]  channel, but a friend stopped you
[8090.54s -> 8092.54s]  and told you to just see where
[8092.54s -> 8094.54s]  it took you. Do you sometimes think about
[8094.54s -> 8096.54s]  that? What would have been had you not taken
[8096.54s -> 8098.54s]  that chance? You still
[8098.54s -> 8100.54s]  talk to that person who was at Burger Boy.
[8100.54s -> 8102.54s]  I'm not sure of my path in life, so
[8102.54s -> 8104.54s]  you don't have any advice. I'm not sure of my path in life.
[8104.54s -> 8106.54s]  Do you have any advice for me? Thank you.
[8106.54s -> 8108.85s]  Mod that friend.
[8108.85s -> 8111.66s]  Well, here's the thing.
[8111.66s -> 8116.46s]  Anytime you start something new,
[8116.46s -> 8119.90s]  right, it doesn't matter what it is,
[8119.90s -> 8123.30s]  after you do it for the first
[8123.30s -> 8125.60s]  time, and you
[8125.60s -> 8127.60s]  go through with it, you have
[8127.60s -> 8129.60s]  that first initial bump
[8129.60s -> 8131.78s]  of, this is dumb,
[8131.78s -> 8133.78s]  this is, I probably shouldn't
[8133.78s -> 8135.78s]  have done this. This is like kind of dumb, right?
[8135.78s -> 8137.78s]  Like, I can
[8137.78s -> 8139.78s]  probably use my time somewhere else.
[8139.78s -> 8141.78s]  Uh, nah, yeah, I'll do something else.
[8141.78s -> 8144.21s]  That happened to me all the time.
[8144.21s -> 8153.04s]  I'm in Vegas right now, I'm over
[8153.04s -> 8156.88s]  21 this time. And if memory serves
[8156.88s -> 8158.88s]  me correctly, it was a
[8158.88s -> 8162.02s]  long time ago. I don't
[8162.02s -> 8164.02s]  remember if it was Burger Boy or not.
[8164.02s -> 8166.02s]  Maybe, I think it was somebody
[8166.02s -> 8169.92s]  that I went to college with.
[8169.92s -> 8171.92s]  Maybe it was, no, who was it?
[8171.92s -> 8175.95s]  This is gonna fucking eat me up now.
[8175.95s -> 8177.95s]  Who said to like just, I
[8177.95s -> 8179.95s]  said that I made a YouTube channel.
[8179.95s -> 8189.15s]  Like you went to college.
[8189.15s -> 8191.15s]  I did. I showed
[8191.15s -> 8193.15s]  my diploma on stream. Did you see it?
[8193.15s -> 8199.55s]  From Blockbuster. I don't remember
[8199.55s -> 8202.82s]  who it was. That'll probably
[8202.82s -> 8205.25s]  come to me, like later tonight or
[8205.25s -> 8209.02s]  something. I don't think it was Burger Boy.
[8209.02s -> 8211.02s]  But they watched, they watched the two or three
[8211.02s -> 8213.02s]  videos that were there. Which by the way, I deleted
[8213.02s -> 8215.02s]  and re-uploaded, I think, twice.
[8215.02s -> 8217.20s]  For some reason.
[8217.20s -> 8221.62s]  Cause once like three or four
[8221.62s -> 8223.62s]  five views came in, I was like,
[8223.62s -> 8225.62s]  what, uh, these videos suck, I have to redo
[8225.62s -> 8227.62s]  them. Somebody watched them, I have to make it better.
[8227.62s -> 8234.59s]  I'm pretty sure I deleted and re-uploaded
[8234.59s -> 8237.60s]  the same three videos like twice.
[8237.60s -> 8241.06s]  But, I was told,
[8241.06s -> 8243.06s]  who cares? Just
[8243.06s -> 8248.18s]  let them ride, it doesn't matter.
[8248.18s -> 8250.18s]  I'm gonna have to fucking go searching for like
[8250.18s -> 8254.40s]  who fucking said that? Who was that?
[8254.40s -> 8256.40s]  Maybe it was Burger Boy. Cause we were going to the gym
[8256.40s -> 8260.18s]  all the time. We, me and
[8260.18s -> 8262.18s]  Burger Boy, believe it or not,
[8262.18s -> 8264.18s]  were in the gym three, four
[8264.18s -> 8266.18s]  plus days a week. Back then.
[8266.18s -> 8268.54s]  And I think I just offhandedly maybe told
[8268.54s -> 8271.87s]  them, yeah, I don't know. Just two
[8271.87s -> 8276.86s]  chads going to the gym.
[8276.86s -> 8278.86s]  But what would I have done if that was,
[8278.86s -> 8280.86s]  I mean, I don't know. I don't know, I can't
[8280.86s -> 8282.86s]  rewind the clock and
[8282.86s -> 8286.06s]  do another life.
[8286.06s -> 8288.06s]  What probably would have happened is I would have gone into something,
[8288.06s -> 8290.06s]  I would have just continued doing the stuff that I
[8290.06s -> 8292.06s]  liked already.
[8292.06s -> 8295.38s]  I was really into
[8295.38s -> 8297.38s]  stuff with animals.
[8297.38s -> 8299.38s]  You know, like volunteering. I was
[8299.38s -> 8301.38s]  probably going to maybe go to like vet tech school.
[8301.38s -> 8303.38s]  I still ended up volunteering
[8303.38s -> 8310.93s]  for a while. But yeah,
[8310.93s -> 8312.93s]  that's sometimes I think about what would I,
[8312.93s -> 8314.93s]  what would happen if I had not made
[8314.93s -> 8318.38s]  half of those videos that I made in the
[8318.38s -> 8320.38s]  first two months that I started
[8320.38s -> 8325.18s]  this channel. But what would
[8325.18s -> 8327.18s]  have happened if my first
[8327.18s -> 8329.18s]  TF2, the Uber
[8329.18s -> 8331.36s]  update video, didn't get on
[8331.36s -> 8333.36s]  the TF2 Reddit?
[8333.36s -> 8335.36s]  Like what would have happened?
[8335.36s -> 8337.36s]  Would I even be sitting
[8337.36s -> 8340.24s]  here right now doing this?
[8340.24s -> 8344.53s]  Probably not. Probably not.
[8344.53s -> 8349.78s]  You would go be an English teacher in Japan.
[8349.78s -> 8352.14s]  I can barely speak English.
[8352.14s -> 8361.49s]  You think I can teach somebody how?
[8361.49s -> 8366.35s]  But any advice, don't
[8366.35s -> 8373.07s]  get in your own way. Because what
[8373.07s -> 8375.07s]  you are describing is me
[8375.07s -> 8377.44s]  almost getting in my way
[8377.44s -> 8379.44s]  to a point where I didn't do any of this stuff.
[8379.44s -> 8381.62s]  Don't get in your own way.
[8381.62s -> 8392.16s]  Got it. Now I'm worth over
[8392.16s -> 8394.16s]  a billion dollars.
[8394.16s -> 8398.70s]  I wish you luck though, Influx.
[8398.70s -> 8402.46s]  Thanks for sticking around. Really
[8402.46s -> 8404.46s]  interesting thought, though. I haven't thought about
[8404.46s -> 8407.22s]  that in a long time. Tar Alecran
[8407.22s -> 8409.22s]  thanks for the 250. Jerm, have you played Heaven's Vault
[8409.22s -> 8414.34s]  on stream? It's made
[8414.34s -> 8416.34s]  by the same crew that made Sorcerate. It's
[8416.34s -> 8418.34s]  an amazing adventure game in its own right. God
[8418.34s -> 8424.74s]  dammit, I'm going to like burp. Hold on.
[8424.74s -> 8427.74s]  Alright, we're good. I have not played Heaven's Vault?
[8427.74s -> 8429.74s]  I'll have to look into that
[8429.74s -> 8433.07s]  but ankle? I'll check it out.
[8433.07s -> 8435.70s]  For any weapon, thanks for the 250
[8435.70s -> 8437.70s]  forodian. Hey Jerma, just wanted to toss
[8437.70s -> 8439.70s]  some coin to my streamer,
[8439.70s -> 8441.70s]  Jerma Bald.
[8441.70s -> 8443.70s]  Hope you had a Merry Christmas. Hopefully I'll be able to catch you
[8443.70s -> 8445.70s]  live on New Year's Eve.
[8445.70s -> 8447.70s]  That stream will be starting probably around 6
[8447.70s -> 8450.19s]  o'clock Pacific.
[8450.19s -> 8453.07s]  9 p.m. Eastern.
[8453.07s -> 8455.07s]  We'll catch the Eastern ball drop.
[8455.07s -> 8457.25s]  And if there's
[8457.25s -> 8459.25s]  enough time, maybe we'll catch the Pacific one as well.
[8459.25s -> 8464.48s]  Maybe.
[8464.48s -> 8466.48s]  I was not with
[8466.48s -> 8468.72s]  Kim last
[8468.72s -> 8471.66s]  year on New Year's.
[8471.66s -> 8473.66s]  So I think I might want to
[8473.66s -> 8475.66s]  kind of end it after the Eastern
[8475.66s -> 8480.27s]  ball drop. Because
[8480.27s -> 8482.27s]  last year I didn't spend New Year's with Kim.
[8482.27s -> 8485.15s]  And
[8485.15s -> 8487.15s]  there's an opportunity too this year.
[8487.15s -> 8495.60s]  It'll be a solid
[8495.60s -> 8498.03s]  probably. We'll at least
[8498.03s -> 8506.54s]  get one or two of them.
[8506.54s -> 8508.54s]  Jerma loves his Eastern time zone viewers.
[8508.54s -> 8511.23s]  I mean I spent
[8511.23s -> 8513.23s]  my entire life on the Eastern time zone.
[8513.23s -> 8515.23s]  And everybody bases
[8515.23s -> 8517.23s]  pretty much everything on the Eastern time zone.
[8517.23s -> 8524.72s]  EST is
[8524.72s -> 8526.72s]  so much
[8526.72s -> 8529.34s]  media is
[8529.34s -> 8531.34s]  dictated by what time it is Eastern.
[8531.34s -> 8540.18s]  That being said, I do love
[8540.18s -> 8542.18s]  PST though, because I gain 3 hours.
[8542.18s -> 8544.61s]  I get 3 hours on
[8544.61s -> 8546.61s]  all of you. Right now it's 10 o'clock.
[8546.61s -> 8549.87s]  It used to be 1 a.m.
[8549.87s -> 8551.87s]  when I would turn the stream off back in
[8551.87s -> 8553.87s]  Massachusetts. It's 10 o'clock.
[8553.87s -> 8559.82s]  I can still get a pizza. But thank you
[8559.82s -> 8562.06s]  Frodeon.
[8598.76s -> 8610.20s]  We'll see.
[8610.20s -> 8612.20s]  Don't forget to vote for stuff yet.
[8612.20s -> 8616.94s]  Subscribe for more, plus like if you did.
[8616.94s -> 8618.94s]  Thank you, level 6.
[8618.94s -> 8623.29s]  Hey Reaper, thanks for the 250.
[8623.29s -> 8625.29s]  Hey Jerma, I was doing the survey for voting and went down
[8625.29s -> 8627.29s]  memory road for this year.
[8627.29s -> 8629.29s]  It's been a great year. When I got to the end
[8629.29s -> 8631.29s]  I wished that I could choose more than one
[8631.29s -> 8633.29s]  for best joke of the decade.
[8633.29s -> 8635.29s]  Keep up the good work and let's make
[8635.29s -> 8637.29s]  this decade as great as the last one.
[8637.29s -> 8639.29s]  Cheers to you and Happy New Year.
[8639.29s -> 8645.54s]  Happy New Year to you as well.
[8645.54s -> 8647.54s]  Yeah, just stay tuned for that show
[8647.54s -> 8650.68s]  on New Year's Eve.
[8650.68s -> 8653.05s]  It was the hardest choice on the list.
[8653.05s -> 8655.05s]  There were a lot of nominations.
[8655.05s -> 8657.05s]  It was actually hard to remove
[8657.05s -> 8659.05s]  some because there was just so many
[8659.05s -> 8661.05s]  in every category.
[8661.05s -> 8664.57s]  At least 10 of those categories were
[8664.57s -> 8666.57s]  full with 25
[8666.57s -> 8668.57s]  plus nominations. It was just
[8668.57s -> 8671.96s]  so many.
[8671.96s -> 8674.14s]  I'm glad there wasn't enough time
[8674.14s -> 8676.14s]  this year for people to at least have
[8676.14s -> 8678.14s]  that week to kind of think about something
[8678.14s -> 8680.31s]  that was fun rather than two days.
[8680.31s -> 8682.62s]  Yeah, it's been a great year.
[8682.62s -> 8684.62s]  A lot of stuff has changed for me
[8684.62s -> 8686.62s]  this year. You know, moved across the
[8686.62s -> 8689.30s]  country. Started to do the stuff
[8689.30s -> 8691.30s]  that I wanted to do many, many years
[8691.30s -> 8693.30s]  ago. Get into some more
[8693.30s -> 8695.30s]  high production, high
[8695.30s -> 8700.17s]  octave streams.
[8700.17s -> 8702.17s]  And I plan on just kind of keeping that
[8702.17s -> 8704.17s]  going for as long as I can, right?
[8704.17s -> 8710.25s]  Cheers to you. Thank you Reaper.
[8710.25s -> 8713.45s]  Dr. Cad,
[8713.45s -> 8715.62s]  thank you for the 500 bits.
[8715.62s -> 8717.62s]  I need you to watch a video just a little
[8717.62s -> 8719.62s]  bit. It's a music video, but I think you'll enjoy it.
[8719.62s -> 8721.62s]  Music video. What do you mean?
[8721.62s -> 8727.13s]  This video is 28 minutes long.
[8727.13s -> 8738.94s]  What the hell is this?
[8738.94s -> 8740.94s]  What?
[8740.94s -> 8744.94s]  What is going on?
[8748.76s -> 8753.24s]  No, this is like scary.
[8753.24s -> 8765.19s]  30
[8765.19s -> 8767.75s]  minutes long. I'm gonna get
[8767.75s -> 8772.23s]  gnomed. I might. I feel like
[8772.23s -> 8775.69s]  I'm gonna skip.
[8792.90s -> 8795.34s]  It's a pretty good video.
[8795.34s -> 8803.32s]  It's 30
[8803.32s -> 8805.32s]  minutes of that. I don't want to watch that.
[8805.32s -> 8808.01s]  That's a long time to sit there and
[8808.01s -> 8815.24s]  watch that. Yeah, there's the link.
[8815.24s -> 8819.66s]  It's right there. It's just a little
[8819.66s -> 8821.66s]  bit. It's a music video.
[8821.66s -> 8827.93s]  Hey Flustered Flamingo, thanks
[8827.93s -> 8829.93s]  for the 300 bits. Hey German, thanks for the laughs this decade.
[8829.93s -> 8831.93s]  Quick question. If you owned the internet
[8831.93s -> 8833.93s]  for one day, what would you change?
[8833.93s -> 8839.75s]  I would delete Twitter, Facebook,
[8839.75s -> 8841.75s]  Instagram, Snapchat,
[8841.75s -> 8845.38s]  TikTok.
[8845.38s -> 8849.86s]  I would delete all social media.
[8849.86s -> 8851.86s]  But not Twitch though, because that's cool. It's fun.
[8851.86s -> 8854.04s]  I would delete all social media.
[8854.04s -> 8859.16s]  No, even Twitch. Even Twitch.
[8859.16s -> 8861.16s]  And YouTube. Delete it all. Get rid of it.
[8861.16s -> 8868.14s]  There would be instant replacements.
[8868.14s -> 8871.21s]  No, and I would have broadcasted on every
[8871.21s -> 8873.21s]  airway. Do I have control of the
[8873.21s -> 8879.10s]  airways? No, I don't. But even
[8879.10s -> 8881.98s]  just,
[8881.98s -> 8883.98s]  they'd instantly get replaced.
[8883.98s -> 8886.15s]  But even just for one
[8886.15s -> 8889.80s]  day, if
[8889.80s -> 8891.80s]  everybody didn't have to use
[8891.80s -> 8895.38s]  it, even for one day,
[8895.38s -> 8898.26s]  even for three days,
[8898.26s -> 8902.49s]  announce it on Twitter.
[8902.49s -> 8906.71s]  Hot boomer take.
[8906.71s -> 8910.36s]  That's a villain thing
[8910.36s -> 8912.36s]  to do. Is that a villain thing
[8912.36s -> 8914.36s]  to do though, really? Think about that.
[8914.36s -> 8926.58s]  We will rebuild it.
[8926.58s -> 8934.71s]  Facebook and TikTok? No. The
[8934.71s -> 8937.02s]  rest, yes. You're a Sunday morning
[8937.02s -> 8940.34s]  cartoon villain.
[8940.34s -> 8942.34s]  And then when Scooby-Doo
[8942.34s -> 8944.90s]  and crew stop
[8944.90s -> 8947.27s]  texting each other, and
[8947.27s -> 8949.27s]  they go play tetherball, and
[8949.27s -> 8952.41s]  then they go, whoa!
[8952.41s -> 8954.41s]  Maniacal Martin sure was actually
[8954.41s -> 8957.22s]  right, wasn't he?
[8957.22s -> 8961.06s]  We enjoyed some time outside.
[8961.06s -> 8963.06s]  Should we go get him out of jail?
[8963.06s -> 8965.06s]  Nah, nah, let him rot.
[8965.06s -> 8977.78s]  Oh, okay.
[8977.78s -> 8979.78s]  Boomer, hot boomer take.
[8979.78s -> 8981.78s]  No, if I had control of the internet,
[8981.78s -> 8985.43s]  no, okay, I wouldn't delete all social
[8985.43s -> 8988.50s]  media. I would take it all over.
[8988.50s -> 8990.50s]  And I would make one tweet and one
[8990.50s -> 8992.50s]  post on Facebook, on Twitter,
[8992.50s -> 8994.50s]  on Instagram, on TikTok. It would
[8994.50s -> 8997.00s]  just be, I'm only
[8997.00s -> 8999.00s]  writing this so people still don't think I'm
[8999.00s -> 9002.07s]  at TwitchCon-Germa.
[9002.07s -> 9009.05s]  Right, going live
[9009.05s -> 9011.05s]  tonight. Here's the
[9011.05s -> 9013.48s]  link. And try to
[9013.48s -> 9015.48s]  break Ninja's record
[9015.48s -> 9017.48s]  for like concurrent people on
[9017.48s -> 9019.98s]  a stream.
[9019.98s -> 9022.22s]  Everybody
[9022.22s -> 9024.22s]  come to this link and just be there.
[9024.22s -> 9026.22s]  So I can get like 700,000
[9026.22s -> 9028.22s]  concurrent viewers for 10 seconds.
[9028.22s -> 9035.64s]  By the way, do any musicians want to play
[9035.64s -> 9048.82s]  a video game? He'd still be
[9048.82s -> 9053.30s]  late. No, if I control the internet,
[9053.30s -> 9055.30s]  I don't know what the fuck I would do.
[9055.30s -> 9065.59s]  I'd get scared. No, but way
[9065.59s -> 9067.59s]  better. Yeah, I would take over all
[9067.59s -> 9069.59s]  social media. And what I would
[9069.59s -> 9071.59s]  simply do, this is the perfect
[9071.59s -> 9073.59s]  take on this whole scenario.
[9073.59s -> 9076.47s]  All I would do, I wouldn't
[9076.47s -> 9078.47s]  delete them. I wouldn't get rid of them.
[9078.47s -> 9080.47s]  I wouldn't take over and tweet something myself.
[9080.47s -> 9082.47s]  All social media platforms,
[9082.47s -> 9084.47s]  all text
[9084.47s -> 9086.47s]  would just be what happens when an
[9086.47s -> 9088.47s]  orc tries to talk to a human in Warcraft.
[9088.47s -> 9097.93s]  Done. Good luck.
[9097.93s -> 9105.67s]  You could be the only source of porn
[9105.67s -> 9111.30s]  on the planet. What are you
[9111.30s -> 9122.95s]  talking about?
[9122.95s -> 9124.95s]  Why would that be the thing I go to?
[9124.95s -> 9133.64s]  Anyways.
[9133.64s -> 9135.64s]  Thank you Flustered Flamingo for the 300
[9135.64s -> 9138.14s]  bits. Appreciate it. Gnarly
[9138.14s -> 9140.14s]  thanks for 250. I know I said that I couldn't donate
[9140.14s -> 9142.14s]  for a while, but I will gladly go into debt
[9142.14s -> 9144.14s]  to tell you, don't go into debt.
[9144.14s -> 9146.14s]  Don't go into debt to give me money. Don't do
[9146.14s -> 9148.14s]  that. Number one. Number two.
[9148.14s -> 9150.14s]  Let's see what you said.
[9150.14s -> 9152.14s]  Do not listen to the garbage that the Drew crew
[9152.14s -> 9154.14s]  spews.
[9154.14s -> 9156.14s]  She's not even a real detective. Nancy Drew, more like
[9156.14s -> 9160.30s]  Nancy fuck you.
[9160.30s -> 9166.36s]  Damn. That's harsh.
[9166.36s -> 9170.78s]  That's really harsh.
[9170.78s -> 9174.04s]  That's a pretty hot take, yeah?
[9174.04s -> 9176.04s]  Don't go into debt for giving me money.
[9176.04s -> 9179.18s]  Ever. For any reason. Keep that.
[9179.18s -> 9184.30s]  Bank it. But thank you for the
[9184.30s -> 9189.03s]  250 though. Drew Hater
[9189.03s -> 9192.55s]  is out. Hey Shmoo,
[9192.55s -> 9194.55s]  thanks for the 500 bits. Thank you Shmoo.
[9194.55s -> 9196.55s]  I've been a viewer since your first Surgeon
[9196.55s -> 9198.55s]  Simulator 2013 video. They're coming out
[9198.55s -> 9200.55s]  with a new one too. You helped me recently
[9200.55s -> 9202.55s]  get through an isolating period in my life.
[9202.55s -> 9204.55s]  I have to think about your advice on
[9204.55s -> 9206.55s]  persistence when things don't happen immediately.
[9206.55s -> 9208.55s]  Also the fact that you've never shit in a public
[9208.55s -> 9210.55s]  bathroom. You've got a lot of dedication
[9210.55s -> 9213.94s]  and that's inspiring as hell.
[9213.94s -> 9215.94s]  Yes, that is true.
[9215.94s -> 9217.94s]  That is still true. I
[9217.94s -> 9219.94s]  have never taken
[9219.94s -> 9221.94s]  a shit in a public bathroom.
[9221.94s -> 9223.94s]  It has never happened in my entire
[9223.94s -> 9225.94s]  life. Not once.
[9225.94s -> 9232.09s]  Never. That's not false.
[9232.09s -> 9234.09s]  I wish I could prove that somehow.
[9234.09s -> 9236.09s]  I've never taken a shit in a public bathroom.
[9236.09s -> 9241.53s]  That's fine. You don't have to believe me. I just
[9241.53s -> 9246.78s]  know it's true. I know it's true.
[9246.78s -> 9248.78s]  Someday you won't have a choice.
[9248.78s -> 9252.94s]  That day has not happened yet.
[9252.94s -> 9255.75s]  Now, I
[9255.75s -> 9257.75s]  don't count
[9257.75s -> 9261.83s]  private
[9261.83s -> 9265.42s]  bathrooms. So
[9265.42s -> 9267.42s]  yes, I have taken a shit in a private
[9267.42s -> 9269.42s]  bathroom. One where it's one person
[9269.42s -> 9271.42s]  you go and you can lock the door.
[9271.42s -> 9275.56s]  Right? Like what
[9275.56s -> 9277.56s]  do you classify as like a public bathroom?
[9277.56s -> 9281.77s]  Changing the definition. That
[9281.77s -> 9284.33s]  counts as a public bathroom. A
[9284.33s -> 9286.33s]  public space. Public private bathroom.
[9286.33s -> 9288.33s]  A private bathroom is
[9288.33s -> 9291.27s]  one not in your house.
[9291.27s -> 9295.88s]  More than one stall is a public bathroom.
[9295.88s -> 9298.12s]  Well, I guess a single
[9298.12s -> 9300.12s]  toilet with a locked door is technically
[9300.12s -> 9302.12s]  a bathroom for the public.
[9302.12s -> 9304.87s]  But it is a private
[9304.87s -> 9308.26s]  bathroom. It's a private bathroom
[9308.26s -> 9317.10s]  in public. Yeah.
[9317.10s -> 9319.10s]  No, it's not. It's a private bathroom
[9319.10s -> 9322.68s]  in... No, that's perfect.
[9322.68s -> 9324.68s]  If it's not in someone's house, it's a public bathroom.
[9324.68s -> 9326.68s]  Yeah. Okay. So I've taken a shit in a public
[9326.68s -> 9331.22s]  bathroom in a private setting.
[9331.22s -> 9333.98s]  Maybe once or twice. But I've
[9333.98s -> 9335.98s]  never taken a shit in a
[9335.98s -> 9340.14s]  multi-stall bathroom.
[9340.14s -> 9342.14s]  If literally anybody can walk in, it's public.
[9342.14s -> 9345.91s]  But I can lock the door. If I
[9345.91s -> 9347.91s]  go into a bathroom that's one
[9347.91s -> 9349.91s]  toilet, I can lock the door and
[9349.91s -> 9354.39s]  just exist and be alright.
[9354.39s -> 9356.76s]  So is that a public bathroom?
[9356.76s -> 9359.77s]  If you can't walk in
[9359.77s -> 9362.33s]  there, it's now my
[9362.33s -> 9377.75s]  temporary private bathroom.
[9377.75s -> 9379.75s]  A real public bathroom has a toilet with
[9379.75s -> 9381.75s]  encircling theater seats.
[9381.75s -> 9384.70s]  Holy shit. Why did I read that?
[9384.70s -> 9387.13s]  I never thought this much about the walls
[9387.13s -> 9389.13s]  I shit surrounded by.
[9389.13s -> 9396.42s]  Do you remember a public bathroom? It's public.
[9396.42s -> 9399.69s]  If you lock yourself in a
[9399.69s -> 9401.69s]  school gym, it's not a private space.
[9401.69s -> 9403.69s]  Yeah, but I'm not taking a shit.
[9403.69s -> 9406.57s]  The school gym is not
[9406.57s -> 9408.57s]  supposed to be a private setting.
[9408.57s -> 9412.15s]  Pulling my pants down and going to the bathroom
[9412.15s -> 9414.15s]  is a private setting.
[9414.15s -> 9416.46s]  It's a private place.
[9416.46s -> 9418.63s]  I'm not going to go to the bathroom in the gym.
[9418.63s -> 9423.05s]  It's open to the public, so it is
[9423.05s -> 9425.05s]  public. Yes. It's a public bathroom, but
[9425.05s -> 9427.05s]  it's a private section of the public
[9427.05s -> 9431.78s]  All right. Listen.
[9431.78s -> 9433.78s]  I've taken a shit in a public bathroom,
[9433.78s -> 9435.78s]  but never a multi-stall public bathroom.
[9435.78s -> 9441.03s]  There you go. Done. What's going on?
[9441.03s -> 9444.23s]  All bathrooms are private.
[9444.23s -> 9446.23s]  We can't sit here and argue
[9446.23s -> 9448.23s]  semantics. I've been trying
[9448.23s -> 9450.23s]  to for the last, like, five minutes.
[9450.23s -> 9460.73s]  Then you shit in a public bathroom.
[9460.73s -> 9462.73s]  Your semantics are bad.
[9462.73s -> 9464.73s]  What about that person that said all bathrooms
[9464.73s -> 9467.22s]  are private? A bathroom
[9467.22s -> 9469.22s]  is a private place.
[9469.22s -> 9480.15s]  This is the best
[9480.15s -> 9482.78s]  comment of the night. Who the fuck
[9482.78s -> 9486.68s]  cares? Yeah.
[9486.68s -> 9488.68s]  That's true.
[9488.68s -> 9490.68s]  That's right. Like, who the fuck cares?
[9490.68s -> 9493.56s]  Who cares if I've never taken a shit in a
[9493.56s -> 9500.92s]  multi-stall public bathroom?
[9500.92s -> 9502.92s]  You do. I do.
[9502.92s -> 9504.92s]  Hey, ButtSquire, thanks for the 250.
[9504.92s -> 9506.92s]  Seeing you react that way to germs on a
[9506.92s -> 9508.92s]  Wiimote reminded me of something.
[9508.92s -> 9515.19s]  What does it remind you of?
[9515.19s -> 9517.19s]  This is a full video. I'm going to watch this
[9517.19s -> 9523.02s]  full video. Have you peed your
[9523.02s -> 9529.46s]  pants? Yes.
[9529.46s -> 9534.39s]  Probably at least a dozen times.
[9534.39s -> 9536.39s]  I've peed my pants.
[9536.39s -> 9543.42s]  Yes.
[9543.42s -> 9545.42s]  I have peed my pants. Not in my
[9545.42s -> 9547.42s]  adult life. Maybe when I was like
[9547.42s -> 9549.78s]  nine, ten years old or something.
[9549.78s -> 9558.60s]  Hey,
[9558.60s -> 9560.60s]  very nice. Thanks for the 750.
[9560.60s -> 9562.60s]  Germa, listen to this. Three months ago I visited a museum
[9562.60s -> 9564.60s]  dedicated to Native American artifacts and memorabilia.
[9564.60s -> 9567.67s]  I eventually came upon a dark and
[9567.67s -> 9569.67s]  foreboding mask with crimson
[9569.67s -> 9571.67s]  feathers adorning it.
[9571.67s -> 9573.67s]  When I stared into its hollow eyes, it had something like
[9573.67s -> 9575.67s]  a spirit trip or a vision.
[9575.67s -> 9577.67s]  I saw everyone I knew and loved become great
[9577.67s -> 9579.67s]  bears, soaring eagles, and
[9579.67s -> 9582.30s]  trampling buffalo.
[9582.30s -> 9584.30s]  Then I woke up on a bench in the museum
[9584.30s -> 9586.30s]  and said, Bobby, have you ever had anything like that happen to you?
[9586.30s -> 9588.30s]  Don't do drugs before you go to a museum.
[9588.30s -> 9595.08s]  That's probably the moral of that
[9595.08s -> 9602.18s]  story. Say no, don't do drugs.
[9602.18s -> 9607.24s]  That was very well-written.
[9607.24s -> 9611.59s]  It was. You're right.
[9611.59s -> 9614.47s]  Can we get back to the game?
[9614.47s -> 9617.03s]  Oh.
[9617.03s -> 9619.03s]  New Basaurus,
[9619.03s -> 9621.34s]  the stream is over.
[9621.34s -> 9623.34s]  If you might be new,
[9623.34s -> 9625.34s]  then that's fine. I don't think you are though.
[9625.34s -> 9627.34s]  I think I've seen your name before.
[9627.34s -> 9629.34s]  At the end of the stream we do all
[9629.34s -> 9631.34s]  the donations that came in that
[9631.34s -> 9633.34s]  have reached a certain threshold.
[9633.34s -> 9635.34s]  We talk about stuff, we just chill out for
[9635.34s -> 9637.34s]  like 30, 40 minutes.
[9637.34s -> 9639.34s]  Sometimes less, sometimes more.
[9639.34s -> 9644.26s]  Just play the game. The stream is over.
[9644.26s -> 9646.82s]  This is the post stream wrap-up
[9646.82s -> 9648.82s]  hangout session.
[9648.82s -> 9657.66s]  It's been on this screen for six hours.
[9657.66s -> 9661.05s]  That would be bad.
[9661.05s -> 9663.05s]  Hey, Matty Eyes,
[9663.05s -> 9665.05s]  thanks for the 510
[9665.05s -> 9668.12s]  bits. Watching through the
[9668.12s -> 9670.12s]  old clips while I was voting for New Year's Eve stream was so
[9670.12s -> 9672.12s]  fun. Looking forward to plenty more fun times.
[9672.12s -> 9674.12s]  Wishing everyone a fun and safe New Year's.
[9674.12s -> 9676.12s]  Much love and may the New Year bring
[9676.12s -> 9678.62s]  great things. Let's hope so.
[9678.62s -> 9681.62s]  I hope so.
[9681.62s -> 9684.87s]  Thank you.
[9684.87s -> 9687.56s]  Snipers, thanks for the thousand bits.
[9687.56s -> 9689.56s]  Here are some bits for that pizza.
[9689.56s -> 9691.99s]  We'll be getting a nice thin crust
[9691.99s -> 9694.36s]  pepperoni pizza. Gonna just
[9694.36s -> 9696.36s]  slowly enjoy it
[9696.36s -> 9700.26s]  while I watch
[9700.26s -> 9702.26s]  surprise eggs videos.
[9702.26s -> 9709.22s]  Oh, can't wait.
[9709.22s -> 9712.17s]  Thank you for the thousand bits.
[9712.17s -> 9714.17s]  Very nice again. Thanks for the
[9714.17s -> 9716.17s]  250 bits you made. Me buy 250
[9716.17s -> 9718.17s]  more bits because you made so much sense
[9718.17s -> 9720.17s]  when you talked about the necessity of simplicity
[9720.17s -> 9722.17s]  in pizza. I was right there with
[9722.17s -> 9724.17s]  you. I felt you. I've been telling people that for about
[9724.17s -> 9726.17s]  five years now, but no one listens to me.
[9726.17s -> 9728.17s]  Maybe they'll listen to the greatest internet entertainer
[9728.17s -> 9730.17s]  alive. German985.
[9730.17s -> 9736.31s]  Hey, if you like
[9736.31s -> 9738.31s]  whatever pizza you like, you like it.
[9738.31s -> 9741.51s]  That's you donating to yourself.
[9741.51s -> 9745.80s]  The rock.
[9745.80s -> 9762.10s]  Wrong pizza opinion.
[9762.10s -> 9764.10s]  Pepperoni is greasy as fuck.
[9764.10s -> 9770.31s]  I like pepperoni on pizza.
[9770.31s -> 9772.31s]  It adds like a nice delicious smoky
[9772.31s -> 9775.00s]  flavor. Especially when
[9775.00s -> 9777.18s]  the pepperonis are
[9777.18s -> 9779.18s]  really crispy. When you bite into
[9779.18s -> 9781.18s]  pepperoni, you get that pepperoni crunch
[9781.18s -> 9783.18s]  that's almost like candy pepperoni.
[9788.81s -> 9790.98s]  It's the best.
[9790.98s -> 9795.59s]  It's the best. And then when you get
[9795.59s -> 9797.59s]  sometimes when pepperoni,
[9797.59s -> 9799.59s]  not all pizza places do this, but
[9799.59s -> 9801.59s]  some of them do. When you have
[9801.59s -> 9803.59s]  pizza in the oven, right?
[9803.59s -> 9805.96s]  And there's pepperoni on it.
[9805.96s -> 9807.96s]  After a little while, the
[9807.96s -> 9809.96s]  little pepperoni discs
[9809.96s -> 9811.96s]  turn into these almost these little
[9811.96s -> 9815.67s]  bowls, right?
[9815.67s -> 9817.67s]  And inside the little cooked
[9817.67s -> 9819.67s]  pepperoni bowls
[9819.67s -> 9821.67s]  is a few droplets
[9821.67s -> 9823.67s]  of this delicious
[9823.67s -> 9825.67s]  magical
[9825.67s -> 9828.62s]  liquid.
[9828.62s -> 9830.62s]  And then when you bite into it and you get
[9830.62s -> 9832.62s]  the crunch of the little pepperoni bowl and
[9832.62s -> 9834.62s]  the sauce and the little oil,
[9834.62s -> 9838.90s]  it's called liquid fat.
[9838.90s -> 9840.90s]  Yeah. And that's good.
[9840.90s -> 9842.90s]  Just don't eat it every day.
[9842.90s -> 9847.90s]  That's fucking heinous.
[9847.90s -> 9850.39s]  No, it's not. What?
[9850.39s -> 9852.39s]  Do I like bacon crispy or soggy?
[9852.39s -> 9854.39s]  Crispy, crunchy, crispity,
[9854.39s -> 9856.39s]  crunchity. Don't give me any soggy
[9856.39s -> 9859.40s]  bacon. Gross.
[9859.40s -> 9872.52s]  Who likes soggy bacon?
[9872.52s -> 9875.66s]  Yeah, I don't. I don't see
[9875.66s -> 9877.66s]  why would soggy bacon
[9877.66s -> 9879.66s]  I wouldn't want to eat soggy bacon.
[9879.66s -> 9886.25s]  Crunchy pepperoni bowls are the best food in the world
[9886.25s -> 9888.25s]  don't change my mind. I'm not trying to. I'm agreeing
[9888.25s -> 9892.15s]  with you. Turkey bacon is also
[9892.15s -> 9894.78s]  awesome. That's true.
[9894.78s -> 9896.78s]  Hey, gray blob thanks for the thousand bits. The only pizza
[9896.78s -> 9898.78s]  topping is worth a damn are bacon and green pepper.
[9898.78s -> 9900.95s]  Bacon's alright in
[9900.95s -> 9902.95s]  small doses. I don't like it all over
[9902.95s -> 9904.95s]  the pizza, but if it's kind of
[9904.95s -> 9906.95s]  put out there, crushed up
[9906.95s -> 9912.39s]  gently. I don't like
[9912.39s -> 9915.14s]  green pepper on pizza. I like a simple
[9915.14s -> 9917.14s]  pizza. I like just cheese, pepperoni
[9917.14s -> 9920.15s]  like margarita style
[9920.15s -> 9922.52s]  pizzas. I like
[9922.52s -> 9924.52s]  just simple. Simple, simple, simple.
[9924.52s -> 9936.49s]  Gray blob thanks for the thousand bits.
[9936.49s -> 9938.66s]  Sucko,
[9938.66s -> 9940.66s]  sucko, me must
[9940.66s -> 9942.66s]  thanks for the 250. Hey, German, here's the protection
[9942.66s -> 9944.66s]  money. I know it's not the agreed amount, but please don't
[9944.66s -> 9947.22s]  kill me.
[9947.22s -> 9949.22s]  That's 250
[9949.22s -> 9951.22s]  bits. That's not
[9951.22s -> 9953.22s]  protection money. That's not protection
[9953.22s -> 9955.22s]  money. What are you talking about? I'm not
[9955.22s -> 9957.22s]  doing anything.
[9957.22s -> 9959.22s]  That's not enough.
[9959.22s -> 9961.22s]  I'm just saying
[9961.22s -> 9963.22s]  I'm just saying
[9963.22s -> 9965.22s]  250 is not like
[9965.22s -> 9967.22s]  that's not protection money.
[9967.22s -> 9969.53s]  That's alright.
[9969.53s -> 9976.18s]  It's not.
[9976.18s -> 9978.18s]  If you walked up to me and said, hey, here's
[9978.18s -> 9980.18s]  $2.50, man, it's my protection
[9980.18s -> 9982.18s]  money. I'd be like, just fucking
[9982.18s -> 9984.18s]  go buy yourself like a pack of gum.
[9984.18s -> 9988.86s]  He's saying that. No, I'm
[9988.86s -> 9995.70s]  not saying that. Here's 250.
[9995.70s -> 9997.70s]  Don't kill me. No,
[9997.70s -> 9999.70s]  I'm not going to kill you over 250, dude.
[9999.70s -> 10002.58s]  That's not
[10002.58s -> 10004.58s]  what I'm saying. I'm not going to
[10004.58s -> 10006.58s]  $2.50, man.
[10006.58s -> 10008.58s]  I'm not going to die over
[10008.58s -> 10020.81s]  250.
[10020.81s -> 10029.13s]  Guys, there's no
[10029.13s -> 10031.13s]  crime movies that are ever made.
[10031.13s -> 10033.13s]  There's no mafia
[10033.13s -> 10035.13s]  movies that are ever made where the guy opens up a briefcase
[10035.13s -> 10037.13s]  and there's $2.50
[10037.13s -> 10039.13s]  in it for the big switch.
[10039.13s -> 10045.91s]  That would be a really shitty movie.
[10063.24s -> 10065.24s]  Do you take Bitcoin? I used to until nobody
[10065.24s -> 10068.38s]  did it. I used to have an Ethereum
[10068.38s -> 10070.38s]  address down in the description.
[10070.38s -> 10072.38s]  And over the course of seven
[10072.38s -> 10074.62s]  months, I think like
[10074.62s -> 10076.62s]  $4 of Ethereum came in.
[10076.62s -> 10079.75s]  I closed it. I'd never
[10079.75s -> 10081.75s]  told me, but I was like, I'm out
[10081.75s -> 10083.75s]  of here. No one's using this.
[10083.75s -> 10090.73s]  How much is that $4
[10090.73s -> 10092.73s]  worth now?
[10092.73s -> 10097.53s]  Probably less.
[10097.53s -> 10099.77s]  Probably a lot less.
[10099.77s -> 10101.77s]  Why are people spamming this video?
[10101.77s -> 10103.77s]  No, I'm not. I'm getting enough
[10103.77s -> 10117.78s]  pizza for God's sake.
[10117.78s -> 10119.78s]  Post your ETH address and I'll give you $100.
[10119.78s -> 10122.66s]  I don't even know what it is.
[10122.66s -> 10127.78s]  I don't even remember. Just
[10127.78s -> 10130.60s]  fuck my shit up.
[10130.60s -> 10133.35s]  That video is old news?
[10133.35s -> 10135.35s]  Yeah, that video is circulated like
[10135.35s -> 10140.09s]  a year and a half ago.
[10140.09s -> 10142.09s]  For the life of me, I can't find the no emotion stream.
[10142.09s -> 10148.17s]  I don't even know what it was. You know the
[10148.17s -> 10150.54s]  address? Well, don't send $100
[10150.54s -> 10152.54s]  to that address because I'm not even sure I can get into
[10152.54s -> 10157.34s]  that account. It was HotLavaNGU.
[10157.34s -> 10159.83s]  That's right.
[10159.83s -> 10162.97s]  That's true. Do you have an OnlyFans?
[10162.97s -> 10165.85s]  I don't know what that is.
[10165.85s -> 10173.98s]  Anyways, we're almost at the
[10173.98s -> 10177.43s]  end.
[10177.43s -> 10181.85s]  Gnarly thanks to the 250.
[10181.85s -> 10183.85s]  Oh yeah, I had a dream on Christmas Eve where I woke up at 6am
[10183.85s -> 10185.85s]  on Christmas morning to you streaming.
[10185.85s -> 10187.85s]  You were being recorded by a camera behind you.
[10187.85s -> 10189.85s]  You were playing League of Legends on a
[10189.85s -> 10191.85s]  tiny laptop. Hope your Christmas
[10191.85s -> 10193.85s]  went better than dream
[10193.85s -> 10202.87s]  Jerma's.
[10202.87s -> 10204.87s]  Alright, here comes the credits.
[10204.87s -> 10206.87s]  Here comes all the subs.
[10206.87s -> 10209.74s]  Thanks a lot guys.
[10209.74s -> 10211.74s]  See you tomorrow for No More Heroes. I'm going to get it to work somehow.
[10211.74s -> 10213.74s]  I will. I will figure it out.
[10213.74s -> 10215.74s]  Even if we have to play it on original hardware, I will.
[10215.74s -> 10228.39s]  We'll figure it out.
[10228.39s -> 10230.39s]  You didn't say it was better? Jerma had a bad...
[10230.39s -> 10232.39s]  No, my Christmas was fine. My Christmas is good.
[10232.39s -> 10234.70s]  I had a relaxing Christmas.
[10234.70s -> 10239.61s]  It was nice.
[10239.61s -> 10242.23s]  But, that's a weird dream.
[10242.23s -> 10244.23s]  Why would it be on a tiny laptop? You can't play games on a tiny laptop
[10244.23s -> 10246.23s]  unless it's
[10246.23s -> 10248.73s]  Candy Crush.
[10248.73s -> 10250.73s]  Why would you play Candy Crush in the first place?
[10250.73s -> 10255.59s]  There are only two places where you
[10255.59s -> 10257.96s]  play Candy Crush.
[10257.96s -> 10259.96s]  And one is
[10259.96s -> 10261.96s]  in the airplane
[10261.96s -> 10263.96s]  because it's on one of those
[10263.96s -> 10265.96s]  weird devices that has weird games on it.
[10265.96s -> 10267.96s]  Or sitting at the one...
[10267.96s -> 10274.17s]  Like sitting at Chili's.
[10274.17s -> 10276.17s]  Because it's on that little kiosk thing that's on the tables.
[10276.17s -> 10279.56s]  Otherwise there's no reason to play that game.
[10279.56s -> 10288.84s]  Should I do it? No.
[10288.84s -> 10290.84s]  Yeah, I'll do a Candy Crush stream.
[10290.84s -> 10292.84s]  No, I won't. Lie. Yes, I will.
[10292.84s -> 10298.92s]  What are my thoughts on acne videos?
[10298.92s -> 10300.92s]  I don't... What do you mean acne videos?
[10300.92s -> 10302.92s]  Videos about people's acne or videos about people
[10302.92s -> 10305.86s]  popping pimples?
[10305.86s -> 10307.86s]  Which, both of those, I'm going to say
[10307.86s -> 10309.86s]  I don't think I want to watch them.
[10309.86s -> 10315.11s]  Hey, Lula!
[10315.11s -> 10317.11s]  Lula, thanks for another 500 bits here.
[10317.11s -> 10319.11s]  My son is 10, but he's aware of
[10319.11s -> 10321.11s]  entertainment versus reality, so swears
[10321.11s -> 10323.11s]  aren't a big deal in our house.
[10323.11s -> 10325.11s]  He knows I'd kick his ass if he talked like you.
[10325.11s -> 10327.11s]  Oh my god!
[10327.11s -> 10329.11s]  But he's allowed to enjoy the show.
[10329.11s -> 10331.11s]  Believe it or not, your content is pretty wholesome, really.
[10331.11s -> 10345.70s]  If you think so.
[10345.70s -> 10350.89s]  As much as we fuck around,
[10350.89s -> 10353.19s]  I do try to just have...
[10353.19s -> 10355.19s]  I try to stay... I try to have fun.
[10355.19s -> 10357.37s]  I don't ever want it to be
[10357.37s -> 10359.37s]  like a downer stream.
[10359.37s -> 10361.37s]  I know sometimes I can
[10361.37s -> 10363.37s]  fly off the handle, and then I can have
[10363.37s -> 10365.61s]  little episodes.
[10365.61s -> 10368.23s]  But for the most part, I like to just
[10368.23s -> 10370.41s]  have fun. And I don't want to
[10370.41s -> 10372.41s]  have fun in
[10372.41s -> 10374.41s]  mean, bad
[10374.41s -> 10377.35s]  ways, I guess.
[10377.35s -> 10379.35s]  Unless it's, you know, we're joking around with
[10379.35s -> 10385.11s]  channel stuff.
[10385.11s -> 10387.11s]  Let's put it this way, I never want anyone to feel
[10387.11s -> 10389.11s]  bad when they watch this stream.
[10389.11s -> 10392.25s]  Like, truly be like,
[10392.25s -> 10394.25s]  oh, I feel like shit watching this stream.
[10394.25s -> 10396.25s]  I don't like this. I don't...
[10396.25s -> 10398.25s]  I feel awful.
[10398.25s -> 10400.25s]  I don't want you to feel bad.
[10400.25s -> 10403.06s]  That's completely against why I
[10403.06s -> 10410.04s]  wanted to have fun.
[10410.04s -> 10413.50s]  You killed God, though.
[10413.50s -> 10415.50s]  Yeah, and like, that was a lot of fun.
[10422.66s -> 10427.14s]  You're a psycho.
[10427.14s -> 10432.78s]  I'm not... Look. Fine.
[10432.78s -> 10434.78s]  You can have your...
[10434.78s -> 10437.66s]  You can have your little... You can have your fun.
[10437.66s -> 10439.66s]  I'm not gonna clip that. That's fucked up.
[10439.66s -> 10443.50s]  What, are you guys trying to protect me now?
[10443.50s -> 10447.21s]  Should I be paying you protection money?
[10447.21s -> 10454.50s]  Alright, we're almost done. We're at the end.
[10454.50s -> 10457.58s]  We have...
[10457.58s -> 10459.58s]  But seriously, thanks for the subs, everybody.
[10459.58s -> 10463.93s]  There's a ton of you now.
[10463.93s -> 10466.30s]  Thanks for letting me continue to do this.
[10466.30s -> 10470.14s]  All of you. But thank you, Lula,
[10470.14s -> 10472.14s]  for the 500 bits. Thank you, Space Marine,
[10472.14s -> 10474.14s]  for the 1500 bits.
[10474.14s -> 10476.14s]  I just got out of my most difficult semester
[10476.14s -> 10478.14s]  that I've ever had in schooling.
[10478.14s -> 10480.14s]  I'm a chemical engineer junior
[10480.14s -> 10482.14s]  at a private university, so we've got a fucking
[10482.14s -> 10486.30s]  real smart one here.
[10486.30s -> 10488.30s]  We bring this up, but seriously,
[10488.30s -> 10490.30s]  chemical engineers in chat,
[10490.30s -> 10492.30s]  doctors,
[10492.30s -> 10494.30s]  lawyers, dentists.
[10494.30s -> 10500.95s]  This past semester has crushed me
[10500.95s -> 10503.26s]  academically, socially,
[10503.26s -> 10505.26s]  mentally.
[10505.26s -> 10507.26s]  You're one of the few people that can always make me smile and laugh
[10507.26s -> 10509.26s]  even when I have been beaten down.
[10509.26s -> 10511.26s]  I wanted to give back even a small amount
[10511.26s -> 10513.26s]  for the great things you've done for my happiness.
[10513.26s -> 10515.26s]  Thank you for being you. Turbo Heart.
[10515.26s -> 10524.14s]  Thanks a lot.
[10524.14s -> 10526.57s]  Hopefully your...
[10526.57s -> 10528.57s]  The hardest part of your schooling
[10528.57s -> 10530.87s]  is over.
[10530.87s -> 10532.87s]  And you can relax a little bit and it won't be as
[10532.87s -> 10534.87s]  bad the next time or when you graduate,
[10534.87s -> 10536.87s]  obviously, when you're getting close.
[10536.87s -> 10540.84s]  Thank you so much for the 1500 bits.
[10540.84s -> 10545.64s]  I wish you luck on your journey
[10545.64s -> 10547.64s]  of becoming a chemical engineer.
[10547.64s -> 10551.93s]  Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking around.
[10551.93s -> 10556.60s]  Don't push yourself too hard.
[10556.60s -> 10563.51s]  Try...
[10563.51s -> 10565.51s]  Trump...Chump...
[10565.51s -> 10567.51s]  T...Trump...
[10567.51s -> 10569.75s]  Chump TTV.
[10569.75s -> 10572.95s]  Here we go.
[10572.95s -> 10575.26s]  Thanks for the 400 bits.
[10575.26s -> 10577.26s]  I work as a movie theater usher and have to clean up the movie theaters.
[10577.26s -> 10579.26s]  Every time you end the stream,
[10579.26s -> 10581.26s]  it reminds me of my job. So dirty.
[10581.26s -> 10583.26s]  Love the streams, big guy.
[10583.26s -> 10587.03s]  Thank you, Chump.
[10587.03s -> 10589.03s]  And maybe if some of you guys would pick up after yourselves
[10589.03s -> 10591.03s]  at throwing shit, dumping drinks on the ground.
[10591.03s -> 10596.28s]  Come on.
[10596.28s -> 10601.78s]  The Jerem Plexus Theater has been open
[10601.78s -> 10603.78s]  since 1981.
[10603.78s -> 10606.02s]  Okay?
[10606.02s -> 10608.02s]  I know that when you're walking it makes
[10608.02s -> 10610.20s]  that horrible sound.
[10610.20s -> 10616.44s]  But
[10616.44s -> 10618.44s]  that's because people are just throwing shit on the ground
[10618.44s -> 10620.44s]  and they're being disgusting.
[10620.44s -> 10630.04s]  When I go to the movies, I buy two drinks
[10630.04s -> 10632.04s]  and just dump one on the floor.
[10632.04s -> 10634.04s]  That's kind of what it feels like sometimes
[10634.04s -> 10637.24s]  in some of these theaters.
[10637.24s -> 10639.24s]  That people are just buying extra popcorn
[10639.24s -> 10644.04s]  so they can just dump it on the ground.
[10644.04s -> 10646.04s]  It's like somebody goes into the movie theater
[10646.04s -> 10648.04s]  and they buy a bunch of those...
[10648.04s -> 10650.04s]  They buy like
[10650.04s -> 10652.04s]  two boxes of dots
[10652.04s -> 10655.10s]  and a lighter
[10655.10s -> 10657.10s]  and they just slowly melt down
[10657.10s -> 10659.40s]  all the dots in the
[10659.40s -> 10661.40s]  container.
[10661.40s -> 10663.40s]  They just slide out and smear the dot
[10663.40s -> 10665.40s]  candy sludge shit all over
[10665.40s -> 10667.40s]  the ground.
[10667.40s -> 10676.49s]  And all over the seats.
[10676.49s -> 10686.15s]  How does a floor even get like that?
[10686.15s -> 10688.15s]  What am I talking about? I'm talking about every movie theater.
[10688.15s -> 10690.15s]  That's not even true.
[10690.15s -> 10692.15s]  Movie theaters nowadays, a lot of them are
[10692.15s -> 10694.33s]  really nice.
[10694.33s -> 10697.53s]  Reclining chairs.
[10697.53s -> 10699.53s]  Room service.
[10699.53s -> 10701.70s]  Have you heard about this?
[10701.70s -> 10703.70s]  You can get room service to your chair
[10703.70s -> 10705.70s]  in some theaters now. You press a button
[10705.70s -> 10707.70s]  and a flight attendant comes down and is like,
[10707.70s -> 10709.70s]  Oh, what do you want? I'll take the
[10709.70s -> 10714.38s]  ham and cheese and...
[10714.38s -> 10721.80s]  That's crazy.
[10721.80s -> 10725.13s]  That's $15 a ticket.
[10725.13s -> 10727.13s]  Here's the thing. I don't think I'd want to do that.
[10727.13s -> 10729.50s]  Imagine ordering a
[10729.50s -> 10731.50s]  full dinner at a movie. You're like
[10731.50s -> 10733.50s]  watching the movie. Your ticket bites out of like
[10733.50s -> 10735.50s]  an avocado BLT
[10735.50s -> 10737.50s]  melt turkey sandwich and like it's
[10737.50s -> 10739.50s]  getting all over you and you like wipe it with fucking napkins
[10739.50s -> 10741.50s]  and what happened on the screen?
[10741.50s -> 10743.74s]  Like you're eating like a full spaghetti
[10743.74s -> 10745.74s]  and you're like, Oh, hold on. I'm like eating
[10745.74s -> 10747.74s]  a full dinner and it's dark.
[10747.74s -> 10753.75s]  It's pitch black in there.
[10753.75s -> 10755.75s]  They have little tables. Yeah, but I don't want to eat in the dark.
[10755.75s -> 10760.81s]  There are some things you can eat in the dark.
[10760.81s -> 10762.81s]  Popcorn, pretzel bites,
[10762.81s -> 10765.75s]  corn chips,
[10765.75s -> 10768.70s]  and those little hot dog bites.
[10768.70s -> 10773.05s]  Get a whole lobster.
[10773.05s -> 10778.36s]  Alright, let's get out of here.
[10778.36s -> 10781.75s]  Al Store, H2O, thanks for the 250.
[10781.75s -> 10783.75s]  Speaking of you in college, you've been approached by your college
[10783.75s -> 10785.75s]  to come speak to students.
[10785.75s -> 10787.75s]  No.
[10787.75s -> 10791.21s]  No, not even close.
[10793.96s -> 10795.96s]  Hey guys, welcome to the graduating
[10795.96s -> 10797.96s]  class of
[10797.96s -> 10799.96s]  2024.
[10799.96s -> 10802.78s]  And the man given the speech today to
[10802.78s -> 10804.78s]  congratulate you all is one of our
[10804.78s -> 10807.21s]  alma mater. You might have
[10807.21s -> 10809.21s]  absolutely no fucking idea who this guy is.
[10809.21s -> 10811.21s]  He got popular by playing
[10811.21s -> 10813.21s]  Team Fortress 2 and saying the word
[10813.21s -> 10815.21s]  Shpee over and over again.
[10815.21s -> 10817.21s]  And by getting his ass kicked
[10817.21s -> 10819.21s]  by one of his close friends
[10819.21s -> 10821.21s]  who would get him to a point where he'd get
[10821.21s -> 10823.21s]  so angry that he would start screaming the F word
[10823.21s -> 10827.75s]  and he was recorded
[10827.75s -> 10829.75s]  without his knowledge and uploaded to
[10829.75s -> 10831.75s]  YouTube. Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, that's where he got his
[10831.75s -> 10833.75s]  star, German985. And like three
[10833.75s -> 10835.75s]  people in the audience would be like
[10835.75s -> 10843.82s]  and I'd have a wicked red face.
[10843.82s -> 10845.82s]  Hey, everybody.
[10847.82s -> 10849.82s]  Oh, I don't feel so good.
[10849.82s -> 10851.82s]  I'm nervous. Hey, everybody.
[10851.82s -> 10853.82s]  Keep asking.
[10853.82s -> 10855.82s]  It's cool. Keep at it, everybody.
[10855.82s -> 10857.82s]  We're going to get out of here.
[10857.82s -> 10875.86s]  Congratulations, everybody.
[10875.86s -> 10881.37s]  Fuchs? No. No, to answer your
[10881.37s -> 10883.37s]  question, nobody knows who the fuck I am.
[10883.37s -> 10885.54s]  Outside of, you know,
[10885.54s -> 10888.68s]  this space. I don't think there's
[10888.68s -> 10890.68s]  very many people there. You also mentioned
[10893.30s -> 10895.30s]  granted my own college hasn't asked Logan
[10895.30s -> 10897.30s]  Paul to come speak, but I can see colleges
[10897.30s -> 10899.30s]  thinking it's something students would be interested in.
[10899.30s -> 10906.34s]  Would they?
[10906.34s -> 10908.65s]  No, you want somebody at your college
[10908.65s -> 10910.65s]  speech to be somebody that can
[10910.65s -> 10912.95s]  tell you, you need like a
[10912.95s -> 10914.95s]  president or something.
[10914.95s -> 10916.95s]  Like a senator.
[10916.95s -> 10919.58s]  I can't make that speech.
[10919.58s -> 10924.50s]  I came back to the stream to hear that.
[10924.50s -> 10931.40s]  I'm sorry. How bad
[10931.40s -> 10934.54s]  was that? Was that bad?
[10934.54s -> 10944.01s]  It wasn't that bad, was it?
[10944.01s -> 10946.01s]  Sorry. What do you mean sorry?
[10946.01s -> 10948.44s]  It was pretty bad?
[10948.44s -> 10952.41s]  Thank you to
[10952.41s -> 10954.41s]  Cheezance for the
[10954.41s -> 10956.41s]  400 bits. 2019 was a bad year
[10956.41s -> 10958.41s]  for me, but your laugh brings me life. Thanks.
[10958.41s -> 10960.41s]  Gotta go. My goddamn
[10960.41s -> 10963.10s]  cat just puked. I'm sorry
[10963.10s -> 10965.10s]  to hear that. Hopefully your cat's alright.
[10965.10s -> 10970.79s]  What size shoe are you? 14.
[10970.79s -> 10977.82s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a fantastic
[10977.82s -> 10979.82s]  rest of your night. Thanks for sticking around
[10979.82s -> 10981.82s]  for the end of the Nancy Drew
[10981.82s -> 10983.82s]  the Sea of Mystery.
[10983.82s -> 10985.82s]  Make sure you vote.
[10985.82s -> 10987.82s]  You only have three days to do so.
[10987.82s -> 10989.82s]  You have until
[10989.82s -> 10992.12s]  you have until 12pm
[10992.12s -> 10994.12s]  Pacific time
[10994.12s -> 10997.51s]  on the 31st.
[10997.51s -> 10999.51s]  That's when the poll is no longer going to be accepting
[10999.51s -> 11005.59s]  any votes.
[11005.59s -> 11007.59s]  I'll be talking about this for the next three days straight.
[11007.59s -> 11010.54s]  I will make a...what are you voting
[11010.54s -> 11012.54s]  for? The worst stuff this
[11012.54s -> 11014.54s]  channel's done in the whole year and some of the best
[11014.54s -> 11017.48s]  stuff the channel's done over the year.
[11017.48s -> 11019.48s]  There are a lot of categories.
[11019.48s -> 11021.98s]  I actually...we got best
[11021.98s -> 11023.98s]  auto appearances on there too.
[11023.98s -> 11025.98s]  And yes, if you were curious, I
[11025.98s -> 11027.98s]  think it was just every time auto
[11027.98s -> 11029.98s]  appeared on the stream in
[11029.98s -> 11037.53s]  2019.
[11037.53s -> 11039.53s]  Have a wonderful rest of your night. See you guys tomorrow.
[11039.53s -> 11088.74s]  Take care guys.
