[0.31s -> 12.50s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.
[12.50s -> 18.50s]  Gonna be playing Candles tonight. Heard it's pretty ridiculous, a lot of jumpscares.
[18.50s -> 22.68s]  So if you don't like jumpscares then, well that's too bad, you're gonna get scared. Scare Saturdays.
[22.68s -> 27.93s]  Bang! Alright, Candles. Get a nice little bonfire here, we're out camping.
[27.93s -> 36.31s]  Enter the forest. Why is my mouse still on the screen? Oh there we go, it's gone now.
[36.31s -> 41.58s]  Okay, here we go. Playing Candles.
[41.58s -> 52.53s]  Ooh, um, I can't see anything. Wait, can I go down here? Yeah, I can.
[52.53s -> 57.47s]  So the whole purpose of this game is I'm supposed to light candles in my haunted house.
[57.47s -> 62.87s]  That's the only thing I read about. Just gonna follow the path.
[62.87s -> 69.10s]  What a weird path. Am I gonna like fall off the edge of the world here?
[69.10s -> 75.95s]  Oh, there's a jump button, okay. Jump. Jump!
[75.95s -> 83.38s]  What kind of house does this person live in? Are you serious? Where do you park your car?
[83.38s -> 86.99s]  Can I go in?
[86.99s -> 91.02s]  This is small text.
[91.02s -> 94.02s]  While you've been away, your basement generator must have run out of fuel,
[94.02s -> 101.02s]  thus your house has been overrun with the dark, loving night imps that scour these parts of the coastline.
[101.02s -> 107.20s]  As you know, they usually like fish, and what they... I don't... I cursive...
[107.20s -> 112.22s]  You know what? Gotta turn on lights. That's all I need to know, right?
[112.22s -> 121.48s]  Oh dear. It is really dark in here. Turn it on!
[121.48s -> 125.17s]  Come on, the game's called Candles! Turn the light on!
[125.17s -> 129.56s]  Oh, my game just like froze. Why can I not turn this on?
[129.56s -> 133.80s]  The game is called freaking Candles. I should be able to turn the candles on.
[133.80s -> 142.62s]  Oh, okay. There's one candle lit.
[142.62s -> 151.39s]  God, this game keeps like freezing! Quit freezing on me, bro!
[151.39s -> 156.49s]  There's a candle in this room. Where is it right here? Lit.
[156.49s -> 163.41s]  There's another one. Hey, look at that. There's another one in the corner.
[163.41s -> 170.90s]  And one more, right? Yes.
[170.90s -> 178.82s]  Hey, we lit up the room! Is that like a picture of like... Who is that?
[178.82s -> 180.82s]  Is that Larry Bird from the Boston Celtics?
[180.82s -> 184.41s]  No, it's like Grover Cleveland.
[184.41s -> 186.90s]  All right. Is it gonna freeze again?
[186.90s -> 191.17s]  Hmm. I think I'll need to get my key to this door from my bedroom.
[191.17s -> 196.78s]  Easy. And this one.
[196.78s -> 201.10s]  Oh! Oh, whoa!
[201.10s -> 204.46s]  There's a person in there! There's like a demon in this room!
[204.46s -> 213.70s]  Oh! What am I supposed to do?
[213.70s -> 221.64s]  What am I supposed to do? Do I have to walk in there?
[221.64s -> 227.95s]  I don't have to walk in this room, do I? Are you kidding me?
[227.95s -> 229.95s]  Oh, dear Lord!
[229.95s -> 235.05s]  Candle! There's a candle in here! He can't get me.
[235.05s -> 237.74s]  He can't get me. There's a candle in the room.
[237.74s -> 240.10s]  You piece of crap!
[240.10s -> 246.48s]  I thought that... No, that's just the shadow of the chair.
[246.48s -> 249.48s]  I thought that because he was a horned being. He was a horned beast.
[249.48s -> 252.49s]  See how it looks like a horned beast?
[252.49s -> 256.46s]  Oh, sh... Turn on! Turn on the candle!
[256.46s -> 262.75s]  Dear God! Is that the only candle?
[262.75s -> 264.99s]  I think that's the only one in this room.
[264.99s -> 272.18s]  Looking... Can I open the fridge? Is that blood?
[272.18s -> 274.42s]  I hate this game already.
[274.42s -> 284.67s]  Oh! Oh! I'm going this way.
[284.67s -> 287.94s]  These candles are lit.
[287.94s -> 292.35s]  Damn it, man! Damn it!
[292.35s -> 295.42s]  Something tells me I have to go in here.
[295.42s -> 298.42s]  Well, true. We'll go back. If I need to, I'll go back.
[298.42s -> 306.28s]  There's no light in this hallway.
[306.28s -> 309.35s]  Jeez! Oh!
[309.35s -> 318.01s]  I figured it out. I gotta bring these mother effers to the light.
[318.01s -> 321.13s]  That's how you kill them.
[321.13s -> 324.13s]  So I gotta drag that one dude that's in that... Oh, the key's in here.
[324.13s -> 328.14s]  Where's the key? It's a pretty huge key!
[329.95s -> 331.95s]  This is the key to my house.
[331.95s -> 334.95s]  Sick like giant three-foot wooden key.
[334.95s -> 340.38s]  I can get into the cellar.
[340.38s -> 344.06s]  I gotta get this guy. This one guy in here.
[346.57s -> 349.87s]  Alright, come on out. Come on out, you son of a bitch.
[349.87s -> 351.87s]  Come on. Come on out!
[351.87s -> 357.82s]  Come on! Did I die?
[363.10s -> 366.73s]  This is the bedroom.
[366.73s -> 369.22s]  Wasn't there a dude in here?
[369.22s -> 378.31s]  I forget. I forget. I forget.
[378.31s -> 381.26s]  Okay, all these are turned on.
[381.26s -> 383.43s]  Get the key again.
[383.43s -> 388.42s]  Oh, god.
[388.42s -> 390.42s]  Where's the light? Oh!
[390.42s -> 392.42s]  Oh, my...
[400.72s -> 406.90s]  This one was so easy last time.
[406.90s -> 413.37s]  Give me the giant wooden key.
[413.37s -> 416.27s]  Come on.
[416.27s -> 418.27s]  Why are the doors closed behind you?
[418.27s -> 422.50s]  Alright, come on.
[422.50s -> 424.50s]  Come on, man. Just come over to me.
[424.50s -> 430.86s]  There's a candle right to the left. Can I do it?
[431.86s -> 444.83s]  There's one more room.
[444.83s -> 445.83s]  There's a guy right here.
[445.83s -> 451.62s]  Come on. Come out. Come out, you piece of crap.
[451.62s -> 455.07s]  Come out. I'm gonna have to run to the desk.
[455.07s -> 459.92s]  Three, two, one, go!
[459.92s -> 465.88s]  What? He should have died from the light.
[465.88s -> 466.88s]  Oh, you...
[466.88s -> 471.32s]  Turn on.
[471.32s -> 473.32s]  Thank you. Alright, I'm back here.
[473.32s -> 475.32s]  Made it back safely.
[475.32s -> 477.88s]  I gotta get this guy out of this room.
[477.88s -> 483.88s]  Get out of that room.
[483.88s -> 484.88s]  You butthole.
[484.88s -> 491.45s]  I'm not the cellar, but there's one imp left in this room.
[491.45s -> 495.10s]  I don't know how to get rid of this guy.
[495.10s -> 496.10s]  I'm jumping onto the desk.
[496.10s -> 503.67s]  Okay, guys.
[503.67s -> 506.67s]  I have no idea how I'm gonna get out of this one.
[506.67s -> 510.45s]  It's on. It's lit.
[510.45s -> 511.88s]  How are you not dead?
[511.88s -> 512.88s]  How are you not dead?
[512.88s -> 514.88s]  Explain that to me.
[514.88s -> 516.82s]  The candle is on.
[516.82s -> 518.82s]  You should not be alive.
[518.82s -> 520.82s]  Okay, I'm gonna go for like a jump over his head.
[520.82s -> 522.82s]  Here we go. Jump over his head.
[522.82s -> 523.82s]  That didn't work.
[523.82s -> 527.09s]  Shit.
[527.09s -> 528.09s]  Here we are again.
[528.09s -> 532.84s]  Can I get this guy to chase me out here into this light?
[532.84s -> 536.00s]  Come on, man.
[536.00s -> 538.00s]  Come on. Look, I'm like a nice, like, succulent human.
[538.00s -> 539.00s]  Don't you want to eat me?
[539.00s -> 540.00s]  Don't you want to eat me?
[540.00s -> 542.00s]  Yeah, you do.
[542.00s -> 544.18s]  You son of a bitch.
[544.18s -> 546.38s]  Need anything in here?
[546.38s -> 548.77s]  That's it.
[548.77s -> 550.71s]  All right.
[550.71s -> 551.71s]  Well, that does that.
[551.71s -> 556.49s]  Now I can go in the cellar, turn on the generator.
[556.49s -> 558.49s]  And I know that's what I have to do.
[558.49s -> 565.53s]  You can't get me in this light.
[565.53s -> 568.37s]  Come on.
[568.37s -> 569.37s]  Yeah.
[569.37s -> 570.37s]  Yes.
[570.37s -> 571.37s]  Yes.
[571.37s -> 574.72s]  The last light.
[574.72s -> 578.15s]  Where is this, like, supposed generator?
[578.15s -> 580.93s]  In here?
[580.93s -> 583.51s]  Damn it.
[583.51s -> 584.75s]  Damn it.
[584.75s -> 585.75s]  I can't see.
[585.75s -> 588.40s]  I can't see anything.
[588.40s -> 592.40s]  There's definitely one in here, and I'm just, like, locking myself in here with them.
[592.40s -> 593.40s]  Turn the light on.
[593.40s -> 600.14s]  Can I turn that on?
[600.14s -> 601.14s]  Turn on the damn generator.
[601.14s -> 602.14s]  How do I, like, turn it on?
[602.14s -> 607.07s]  Is it, like, a tool over here I can use?
[607.07s -> 610.94s]  There it is.
[610.94s -> 611.94s]  Why is this not turning on?
[611.94s -> 614.07s]  Come on, generator.
[614.07s -> 621.15s]  Generate some electricity.
[621.15s -> 622.15s]  I just, like, flung it on.
[622.15s -> 623.15s]  Can I, like, fling it?
[623.15s -> 624.39s]  Why?
[624.39s -> 625.39s]  It started to move.
[625.39s -> 626.76s]  Hold on.
[626.76s -> 627.76s]  Spin.
[627.76s -> 628.76s]  Spin.
[628.76s -> 629.76s]  I command you to spin.
[629.76s -> 632.73s]  There we go.
[632.73s -> 633.73s]  There we go.
[633.73s -> 637.14s]  I'm doing it.
[637.14s -> 642.16s]  Maybe not.
[642.16s -> 643.16s]  What the hell?
[643.16s -> 644.16s]  What kind of generator is this?
[644.16s -> 652.42s]  Not really working, are you?
[652.42s -> 655.00s]  Oh!
[655.00s -> 656.00s]  I got two lights on.
[656.00s -> 657.00s]  I got two lights on.
[657.00s -> 658.00s]  I got two lights on.
[658.00s -> 659.00s]  I'm almost...
[659.00s -> 660.00s]  I'm almost got the generator on.
[660.00s -> 663.22s]  I can't believe this is how you do this.
[663.22s -> 664.22s]  This is the most, like, awkward way.
[664.22s -> 666.22s]  I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
[666.22s -> 670.86s]  Spin.
[670.86s -> 672.86s]  Spin, you fool.
[672.86s -> 674.61s]  Spin.
[674.61s -> 676.30s]  Yes!
[676.30s -> 677.60s]  Yeah!
[677.60s -> 681.40s]  Oh!
[681.40s -> 682.40s]  Did I do it?
[682.40s -> 685.09s]  Oh, yeah.
[685.09s -> 686.09s]  Generator's on, baby.
[686.09s -> 688.97s]  That's how we do it.
[688.97s -> 690.78s]  All the lights are on, right?
[690.78s -> 691.78s]  If I get out of the cellar?
[691.78s -> 692.78s]  Oh!
[692.78s -> 694.73s]  Perfect!
[694.73s -> 695.73s]  See you later, monsters.
[695.73s -> 696.73s]  That's Candles.
[696.73s -> 697.73s]  If you want to go...
[697.73s -> 698.73s]  It's free.
[698.73s -> 700.61s]  Link will be in the description.
[700.61s -> 701.61s]  It's a jump fest, as you saw.
[701.61s -> 702.61s]  A lot of crazy screams that I'm not that proud of right now.
[702.61s -> 703.61s]  But anyways, guys, I'll see you all next time.
[703.61s -> 704.61s]  And, of course, take care, everybody.
[704.61s -> 705.61s]  Light the candles!
[705.61s -> 706.61s]  Bye!
[706.61s -> 707.61s]  Bye!
[707.61s -> 708.61s]  Bye!
[708.61s -> 709.61s]  Bye!
[709.61s -> 710.61s]  Bye!
[710.61s -> 711.61s]  Bye!
[711.61s -> 712.61s]  Bye!
[712.61s -> 713.61s]  Bye!
[713.61s -> 714.61s]  Bye!
[714.61s -> 715.61s]  Bye!
[715.61s -> 716.61s]  Bye!
[716.61s -> 717.61s]  Bye!
[717.61s -> 718.61s]  Bye!
[718.61s -> 719.61s]  Bye!
[719.61s -> 720.61s]  Bye!
[720.61s -> 721.61s]  Bye!
