[3.06s -> 7.08s]  Hello. Yeah, sorry about that. I was, I was ready to go.
[8.04s -> 12.94s]  Uh, but, uh, Mr. Otto, I did the thing where he runs around in a circle,
[12.94s -> 17.42s]  sprints, dive bombs your knees, says, get me outside now.
[18.30s -> 25.46s]  I did. Being early yesterday really took it out of him.
[27.30s -> 33.42s]  You're a baby? I'm not the baby. I'm taking care of my baby, Otto.
[33.42s -> 43.66s]  Did you understand? Oh, pounded. You got it.
[44.22s -> 50.01s]  All right. Yeah. So it's a day. I tweeted. We're good. I'm probably
[50.01s -> 54.25s]  talking to you. Look at my tweet was ready. My tweet went up before the stream went up.
[54.25s -> 63.75s]  That's how, you know, I was ready. Every other stream, I sit there, I press live and I go,
[65.75s -> 69.54s]  I forgot to tweet. Hold on. Give me a second. That's my proof to you that I was ready.
[72.46s -> 77.43s]  But we're going to do no more heroes three finale today. I believe there's only about
[77.43s -> 82.20s]  two or three more hours left in the game. And then from there, we're going to move back to
[82.20s -> 95.42s]  WarioWare. Hopefully get to level 50 in super hard. You said Spore? Oh, you're talking about
[95.42s -> 104.15s]  the title. It does say, it does say like Spore save file. Okay, maybe I should change that.
[105.11s -> 109.91s]  It says Suda 51's Spore save file. But that's like a reference to like how
[109.91s -> 114.39s]  fucked up this game is and all the characters are like Spore characters and like WWE 2K characters.
[115.11s -> 119.67s]  That was, that was a joke. Is it misleading? All right. I'll change it. I'll change it. I'll change
[119.67s -> 123.88s]  it. I'll change it. That's, is that misleading? You think it's, is it too misleading? That was a
[123.88s -> 132.54s]  joke we made like a week ago. How about, how about I, okay, how about this? I got it. I got it. I got
[132.54s -> 140.46s]  it. I got the fix. How about I change the title to what I imagine Suda 51 Spore save file looks like?
[143.32s -> 150.38s]  That's so wordy. I actually kind of like it. Yeah, I like that. I like that. It sucks.
[154.63s -> 159.75s]  We just play Spore. I'm going to put what I am. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I got it. Don't worry.
[159.75s -> 170.55s]  Why can't I change the title? I can't change the title of my own stream. Why? I don't understand.
[171.75s -> 181.16s]  Edit stream info is grayed out. What is, okay. I just hit, I just pressed the cancel button. I
[181.16s -> 187.14s]  don't know that I, what happened? Did something happen? It was just a cancel button that I could
[187.14s -> 193.78s]  press on the top of my screen and I just pressed cancel. Let's just log off. I don't have no idea.
[193.78s -> 202.71s]  Here we go. Okay. Here we go. How about here? What I imagine Suda 51 Spore save file
[203.83s -> 223.19s]  looks like there. Are you happy? I like that. I like that. All right, let's go.
[223.83s -> 238.92s]  Hey, can you not stream? Why is it in brackets? Because like that's me thinking that's,
[238.92s -> 252.55s]  that's what I imagine a Suda 51 Spore save file looks like that's internal monologue. Oh, don't,
[252.55s -> 256.15s]  okay. Now here we go. Now you're all going to tell me you don't have an internal monologue, right?
[257.38s -> 262.68s]  Chat can't rotate a cube in their head, OmegaLul, right? Is this, are we going to go down this road,
[262.68s -> 278.55s]  this road again? If they laugh. All right, let's go. A title's fixed. It's fine.
[280.63s -> 287.83s]  Suda 51 Spore save, but everyone was like, holy shit, how did you get that? What? It was a,
[287.83s -> 293.06s]  whatever. All right, we're going back. All right, let's play. By the way, I need to make this really
[293.06s -> 300.52s]  clear. This is the end of the game. If you are very excited to get your hands on No More Heroes 3
[300.52s -> 306.18s]  eventually, you're about to see the last third of the whole game. I just want to make that really
[306.18s -> 324.34s]  clear. You ready? Okay. And then after this, we are going to go to, I almost said No More Heroes,
[324.34s -> 330.22s]  but that's what we're doing right now. WarioWare on the same console. It'll be a very easy switch.
[331.18s -> 340.52s]  Okay. So, uh, first things first, I'm going to try to get to at least 20.
[341.40s -> 349.90s]  Because I had 20 before. This just is WarioWare. I might as well just be playing WarioWare again.
[356.50s -> 359.78s]  Those of you asking for a face cam? Nope. It's not going on until WarioWare.
[360.34s -> 363.46s]  Maybe if you're good, it'll turn on once this stream here for the next like two hours.
[368.58s -> 369.86s]  Dude, you forgot to start streaming.
[369.86s -> 377.85s]  Face cam on no balls. That doesn't matter. I don't care.
[379.29s -> 381.29s]  Face cam does not matter to me. It's not going on.
[388.41s -> 394.65s]  What if I say please? Okay. Okay. They said please. They did. You did. You said please.
[395.61s -> 401.13s]  That one person said please. In the sea of demanding chatters.
[405.19s -> 405.59s]  There you go.
[408.39s -> 412.55s]  We're going back to 2012, German, when I wore just muscle shirts every day. Remember that?
[412.55s -> 426.90s]  Remember that, Ark? It's coming back. By the way, you get this until this minigame is over.
[439.14s -> 443.30s]  This is boring. Oh, that was, that was not you guys saying that. That was the game saying that.
[444.10s -> 446.90s]  Face cam's going off. Thanks, everybody. Now we're gonna play the game.
[449.38s -> 458.87s]  Just have to get ready. I got 20 points in that. It doesn't matter. What was the last thing we
[458.87s -> 467.43s]  were just doing in No More Heroes 3? How much money do I have? Alright, I just had done the
[467.43s -> 481.24s]  last thing. So let's go. We're out with the beard. No, the beard actually has to get shaved tonight.
[481.24s -> 484.52s]  The only reason why I didn't do it last night or the night before is because I knew I was
[484.52s -> 489.00s]  gonna probably have the face cam on for a portion of the screen. And as you all know,
[489.00s -> 493.80s]  I don't like the way that I look with a clean shaved face. I don't like it. It makes me look
[493.80s -> 499.24s]  weird. So I have this rule where I am not, and this is, I'm not kidding. People think this is a
[499.24s -> 501.88s]  joke, but there's a lot of new viewers. I need to make sure that new viewers know this too.
[503.37s -> 511.77s]  I only go into public and I only show my face to people after two days have gone by after shaving
[511.77s -> 519.37s]  my face. So I have, I plan my get togethers around if two days will have gone by after shaving.
[519.93s -> 524.44s]  So if I, let's say I get invited to do something. Hey man, you, uh, what are you up to on Saturday
[524.44s -> 531.78s]  night? And it's Friday, like Friday afternoon. I'm like, oh, um, I got some, yeah, I got some stuff
[531.78s -> 536.86s]  going on. Oh, you sure? You don't want to? No, I got some stuff going on. Sorry. What are you doing
[536.86s -> 544.62s]  on Sunday night or Monday afternoon? Uh, nothing. Perfect. I'm going to be free on Monday afternoon.
[545.42s -> 555.42s]  Exactly two to three days after shaving conventions and meet like get togethers and meetups.
[555.42s -> 562.68s]  Every time a Twitch con happened or every time like a PAX would happen, I would shave. Okay. So
[562.68s -> 569.24s]  on day one of a PAX, right? Most people are kind of coming in and people aren't necessarily
[569.96s -> 573.00s]  seeing each other. It's like, oh, you come in, you travel. It's a travel day. Everyone's like,
[573.00s -> 576.28s]  I'm going to get in. It's going to be like eight o'clock. I'm sleeping and asleep at the hotel.
[576.28s -> 580.60s]  I would shave that morning because it was guaranteed. I wasn't going to see anybody,
[580.60s -> 584.60s]  except like whatever people on the plane, but I don't care. And then like a full day would
[584.60s -> 589.48s]  go by day one. Like that's day zero packs. Like day one of packs will be one full day.
[590.36s -> 593.32s]  I know that all the people do stuff on the Saturday nights, which would be two full days.
[594.82s -> 598.50s]  So therefore, like for the actual time when I know I'm going to see people, I look at my,
[598.50s -> 603.46s]  I look my best two full days go by. I get that slight five o'clock shadow. Go watch the dollhouse
[603.46s -> 610.26s]  streams. Go turn on day one of the dollhouse streams. That was exactly 48 hours to the moment
[610.26s -> 618.12s]  the stream started that I shaved. Just get a trimmer. No, I can't get it. I don't like
[618.12s -> 624.44s]  trimmers. Trimmers make me break out bad. I've tried to use an electric. And by the way, half
[624.44s -> 630.73s]  the time those things don't even fucking do anything. I have had nice beard trimmers and
[630.73s -> 636.57s]  electric razors. You just, you have your face as a hair minefield. They don't do anything. I've
[636.57s -> 645.93s]  never had one that actually works well. I will go by and it's like, okay, there's still all the
[645.93s -> 650.33s]  hair is still there. And now my face just is stinging hurts. And I'm going to have like a
[650.33s -> 663.14s]  breakout tomorrow. I've tried every kind of, I've tried it every time. Is this the, have I done this
[663.14s -> 682.01s]  one? Just get a beard. No, I can't grow beards. I have to, it has to be two days without shaving.
[683.29s -> 684.17s]  And then it's perfect.
[698.06s -> 713.70s]  It's a pretty good song for this. Oh, got it. Shave on screen. I already did.
[727.90s -> 730.94s]  By the way, I'm in one of those moods again today. I don't know what it is.
[731.90s -> 754.15s]  Um, where is it? There it is. Trash. Trash. Come on. Trash. Trash. There's still trash over here.
[755.19s -> 758.47s]  Oh my God. I don't like these missions. These are my least favorite.
[762.18s -> 776.90s]  These are my least favorite missions in the whole game. Where is it? Come on.
[777.54s -> 797.30s]  That's gotta be close, right? Well, I didn't get it all. I didn't get it all. Whatever. These,
[797.30s -> 800.94s]  I don't like these ones. You see that? I'm trying to make money.
[806.07s -> 818.31s]  Bronze. Whatever. It's money. That's money. If level three opens up, I just really don't want
[818.31s -> 821.35s]  to do it as much as I love this game. And I love like completing a lot of the stuff. Yeah.
[821.35s -> 827.54s]  Anuvala. Whatever. I'll do it. Fine. It's right here. I don't care. I'm going to pay attention to
[827.54s -> 849.51s]  this. Does that mean that there's one hidden somewhere? I don't get it. I think that's what
[849.51s -> 867.22s]  that means. That sucks. Oh, get out of here. Hey, get out. Get out. Get out.
[868.34s -> 872.50s]  No, we have to move on from that. I love that reference and it's a really funny video and it's
[872.50s -> 878.18s]  a really interesting community joke, but I can't just do the seal every day. I have to, I can't,
[878.18s -> 887.16s]  I got to move on. Maybe it's just so interesting that I'm allowed to do it more than once a week.
[888.12s -> 894.49s]  I don't want to go too far up because I want to just go through the middle.
[895.53s -> 907.13s]  What do you guys think? What's the amount of time that we're allowed to be stuck on one reference
[907.13s -> 914.17s]  or one joke for the streams? Now that I'm only live like once or twice a week. I think, I think
[914.17s -> 932.54s]  it's probably, I think it's probably two weeks, three months. I think that's too long. Where is
[932.54s -> 948.31s]  it? How are you ever supposed to reliably do this in this amount of time? Depends on how funny you
[948.47s -> 960.09s]  think it is. That's a good point. You're right. Aaron should be forever. Aaron was not,
[960.09s -> 967.62s]  Aaron was supposed to be like a day. Aaron way overstayed its welcome and became something that
[967.62s -> 975.48s]  you guys now actually want to hear all the time, which is bizarre to me. And Lala too. I, people,
[975.48s -> 981.08s]  people unsubscribe because of Lala. You understand that? Do you know that that happened?
[981.88s -> 1004.15s]  Liz almost lost. Three, two, one. I don't care if it's bronze. I'm just trying to get through them.
[1005.91s -> 1013.45s]  Get the non-believers out of here. I just want the metal so I can unlock the next level.
[1014.09s -> 1027.98s]  3,500. Nice. Level four. No. All right. I don't need to do it again.
[1034.33s -> 1042.68s]  Bronze. All right. Is there anything else I can do? What, what do we got going on here?
[1042.68s -> 1048.81s]  Head to the Thunderdome. Okay. Fine. I'm just trying to make a little bit of extra cash before
[1048.81s -> 1062.34s]  we go. Thunderdome. Remember, can a kangaroo walk backwards? Probably hop backwards. Shortcut.
[1063.30s -> 1079.02s]  Maybe. Or can they? I don't know. I have no idea. All right. Back in the Thunderdome. All right.
[1079.58s -> 1083.42s]  Head to the, head to the Thunderdome. Find it. Okay. We just have to do designated matches.
[1084.30s -> 1087.42s]  I got to remember how to play the video game because it has been a while.
[1088.38s -> 1108.39s]  All right. Let's go to these ones up here. And for a match. This game sucks with two C's. Can
[1108.39s -> 1113.75s]  I ask you guys something? I think we have a fairly, there's a fairly large zoomer population here,
[1113.75s -> 1122.33s]  I think, right? What do you, as the potential zoomer population, what, what like kind of your
[1122.33s -> 1128.66s]  generational slang or your generational terms do you not like the most? What do you think?
[1128.66s -> 1131.83s]  Well, like what, what's like your like genera- not even like slang, but what's your like
[1131.83s -> 1152.23s]  generational thing that you guys have that you like the least? Lit. Fringe. Suss. Fortnite. Suss.
[1154.15s -> 1157.83s]  I'm not sure Suss will continue to, I don't know. I don't think Suss will live as long as
[1157.83s -> 1168.66s]  we think it will. Remember how to play the game Andy, right? That's not even a place where that
[1168.66s -> 1178.79s]  works. Hey, you know what my favorite is? My favorite is Andy. That's my favorite. I have
[1178.79s -> 1187.85s]  like a powerful move right now. Oh my goodness. We're about to kill everybody in the room.
[1192.17s -> 1197.19s]  Right, I have these moves. Okay, cool. Game's a little loud, I think, isn't it?
[1198.87s -> 1210.17s]  Andy. Oh my god, I got it again. Full green mode. All right, I gotta get in the middle.
[1210.17s -> 1222.84s]  Everybody can see me. And, ha! It's you. You gotta be the worst. What are you talking about?
[1223.64s -> 1232.14s]  What are you, hold on. I'm, you just threw me off big time right now. What do you mean? I just
[1232.14s -> 1245.70s]  freaked out. What are you talking about? Me? I'm the worst zoomer thing? Is that technically true?
[1250.42s -> 1254.92s]  You got me all fucked up right now. That's technically a true statement.
[1265.61s -> 1270.81s]  Ego obliterated. I'm, oh, I'm dead. I, you just really screwed my whole thing up here.
[1272.17s -> 1277.58s]  You just shattered my entire world view of everything. Let me turn the game down a little.
[1278.70s -> 1293.11s]  What the fuck? Damn, that's based. I don't think based is a zoomer thing. I think that was around
[1293.11s -> 1299.67s]  when, like, more than 10 years ago, wasn't it? All right, let me get back into this.
[1309.96s -> 1311.56s]  Sussy Baka is the worst one.
[1317.05s -> 1321.77s]  Why is it giving this shit to me? Why is it giving this to me? I must be really mad that I'm, like,
[1321.77s -> 1330.04s]  doing so poorly. Based is old. Yeah, based is really old. Based is not even, like, in the last
[1330.04s -> 1363.70s]  10 years. He's not dead? What just happened? Based based cringe cringe. That was $10,000 for that?
[1363.70s -> 1375.93s]  What the hell? Onions, onions. All right, dude, I think we need a rock out break. It's been
[1375.93s -> 1388.81s]  15 minutes. I'm, I think I'm gonna be fine. I think I'm gonna be okay. There's a bike there.
[1389.45s -> 1408.78s]  And we're off. I thought I could drive over that. You know, I want there to be studies done on
[1408.78s -> 1417.51s]  things. Like, for instance, has, is pepperoni, like, has there been a percentile lossage in
[1417.51s -> 1421.27s]  if pepperoni is everyone's favorite topping generation to generation? You know what I mean?
[1422.86s -> 1428.14s]  Like, okay, from boomers to millennial to zoomers, is pepperoni, do we lose any percentage points?
[1428.78s -> 1432.71s]  What's, like, your, what's a zoomer's, like, favorite pizza topping, right?
[1433.27s -> 1443.11s]  Like, what's a millennial's favorite pizza topping? Is it, is it, is that universally,
[1443.11s -> 1450.70s]  like, the best pizza topping that everyone agrees on? I wonder. That's, that stuff kind of intrigues
[1450.70s -> 1476.84s]  me. Black olives? Because, like, those tastes don't change. Like, pepperoni universally, like,
[1476.84s -> 1480.68s]  80% of people like on their pizza. Like, doesn't matter what generation or who you are, where you
[1480.68s -> 1495.05s]  are. That's interesting, isn't it? Three of these guys. All right, I gotta pay attention.
[1500.36s -> 1515.56s]  These guys are horrible. These guys are the worst enemy. Jesus. I can't see. I've been jumping
[1515.56s -> 1525.62s]  around. It freaks me out. I don't like the jumping. I feel like, I feel like I just played,
[1525.62s -> 1534.78s]  I'm in a game of Overwatch right there. Do we talk about particle effects in games and how,
[1534.78s -> 1542.58s]  like, they've gone way too overboard? Have we talked about that yet? I know that I've talked
[1542.58s -> 1551.72s]  about that. Like, I want less particle effects in video games, not more. I'm fucking dead.
[1552.60s -> 1561.27s]  Those guys, I was on the ground. I just got combo'd. All right, this is a good warm-up
[1561.27s -> 1563.75s]  period. I'm just warming up. I haven't played this game in like a week. Give me a break.
[1568.12s -> 1586.44s]  Wait. All right, that's better.
[1586.44s -> 1601.08s]  Come on. Come in. Come on. Wait. Wait, miss? What happened?
[1606.71s -> 1618.36s]  Get over here. Anyways, what was it? Oh, yeah. Particle effects in video games.
[1619.70s -> 1622.66s]  There was, for some reason, a trend started happening in the last 10 years
[1623.22s -> 1628.90s]  that I'm really not a fan of. And it's when particle effects take over the entire video
[1629.86s -> 1632.58s]  game. I'm going to say something here that it's going to make a lot of people probably upset.
[1633.22s -> 1636.34s]  I don't know. It might. Because I don't think I've talked about this specific instance in this.
[1637.70s -> 1639.22s]  I just remember...
[1642.60s -> 1647.08s]  Personal opinion. Personal opinion. This is not... I don't... I think it's a great series.
[1647.08s -> 1651.64s]  It's an incredible franchise. I love it. I've played hundreds, if not potentially thousands
[1651.64s -> 1656.60s]  of hours of this franchise. I'm going to die if I stop talking. I'll talk about it after.
[1657.16s -> 1660.20s]  I'm going to die. And it's going to be your... No, it's not. It's my fault.
[1662.33s -> 1672.31s]  I brought this up. It's not your fault. Okay. Anyways, listen to me. So, Super Smash Brothers,
[1673.91s -> 1680.07s]  the new iterations of the game, the last two iterations, the particle effects are so
[1680.07s -> 1686.39s]  outrageous to me in my brain. Like punching and kicking and jumping. They like these huge,
[1686.47s -> 1696.55s]  massive particle effects. I like the game. I think it's a really great game. But every time
[1696.55s -> 1701.75s]  I punch and kick somebody, it's like... You see these giant flashing clouds appear over everybody's
[1701.75s -> 1716.17s]  head. It's almost hard sometimes to see. Like, okay, I'm doing a combo. I see these two or three
[1716.17s -> 1725.08s]  giant flashes of big bright clouds of sparkles and explosions over people. I want less. And now
[1725.08s -> 1729.24s]  that I said that, I'm sorry that I just... People that are going to... If you play that game and
[1729.24s -> 1733.00s]  you're a fan of it, you're now going to see what I'm talking about. And I may have just fucked up
[1733.00s -> 1751.24s]  your entire view of that game. I'm sorry. I think that's why I like the Souls series.
[1752.97s -> 1757.21s]  You may have just come up with the reason why, even though those games are kind of hard
[1757.21s -> 1762.41s]  and somewhat frustrating and annoying to me, that it is one of my favorite franchises ever.
[1765.16s -> 1771.85s]  That's a really good point. Because there's no extra shit added on those games. If I punch
[1771.85s -> 1780.89s]  somebody or if I slash somebody with a sword in Dark Souls, the sword just hits them. A gigantic
[1780.89s -> 1784.81s]  bright particle cloud of bright colors and explosions don't come out of their body.
[1786.09s -> 1795.30s]  I don't like that training. Over-stimulation. Yeah, it's just over-stimulating. Like,
[1795.30s -> 1805.54s]  headache-inducing the way. It hates this game. No. This blood... Yeah, but there's a difference
[1805.54s -> 1813.14s]  between like blood coming out and like bright sparkly explosions and huge smoke particle effects
[1813.14s -> 1829.19s]  coming out when you touch somebody. I heard that Mass Effect 2 does not have that. So this is a
[1829.19s -> 1837.99s]  roundabout way of you saying that this should be blood and smash. Oh my god. I'm sorry.
[1848.07s -> 1853.46s]  I'll be really honest with you. And I have to be. Because if I'm not honest with you, then I can't
[1853.46s -> 1859.64s]  be honest with myself, right? If there was blood and smash besides the giant huge bright flash of
[1859.64s -> 1864.52s]  particle effects every time you hit somebody, I would probably like the game more. It's very
[1864.52s -> 1884.82s]  easy to say that. But no, I'm not... Listen to me. I'm not saying that I would prefer it. I'm just
[1884.82s -> 1891.93s]  saying that like there would be less on the screen. I just want less stuff on the screen when I hit
[1892.01s -> 1905.03s]  stuff. That's it. I'm going this way. He wants to see Mario bleed. No, I just want to see Mario
[1905.03s -> 1926.54s]  have... I want less stuff on the screen. You want Mario dead. You're a psycho. I'm not though. I
[1926.54s -> 1932.70s]  know there's people here that agree with me. That want to see less obscene particle explosions
[1932.70s -> 1935.74s]  every time they see anything. Oh, hold on. I thought the game crashed.
[1945.10s -> 1952.68s]  I know these people agree with me. I know they're in here. Why did it happen?
[1964.30s -> 1966.46s]  You're literally the only one. No, I can't see.
[1969.82s -> 1972.78s]  It can't be. That's why I couldn't really... That's why I didn't care about Overwatch.
[1988.25s -> 1992.25s]  It's the way that you phrased it. What, because I said I would rather they be blood and smash
[1992.25s -> 1998.73s]  brothers than bright particle effects? I'm not talking about mortal combat levels of blood.
[2000.66s -> 2003.94s]  Oh, shit. This is bad. This is a hard place to fight everybody.
[2003.94s -> 2026.17s]  Strawberry. Yeah, be careful here. Invincible. Oh, thank God. What? Why are they staying alive
[2026.17s -> 2068.23s]  after that? Stupid particle effects. Are these my screen? Whatever. Pretending to be bad again.
[2069.03s -> 2080.98s]  Do the mission. This is the mission. This is the game. I have to make enough money
[2080.98s -> 2097.10s]  from doing the jobs in the mission. Come on. That's so stupid. Oh, whatever. Who cares?
[2106.22s -> 2112.78s]  What else do you want blood in? I don't want blood in Smash Brothers. I just said that I prefer less
[2112.78s -> 2121.90s]  stuff on the screen. And like a blood splatter would be way less than like the smoke explosions.
[2122.70s -> 2126.06s]  Let's get this over with. You're putting words in my mouth. Stop it.
[2133.42s -> 2136.95s]  All right, let's kill. I gotta get rid of these guys first. These guys are the worst.
[2152.97s -> 2159.06s]  What about Wii Sports? I don't know what you're talking about. Why would they be blood in Wii
[2159.06s -> 2177.37s]  Sports? Come on. What about boxing in Wii Sports? But there's okay. Comedy violence is different
[2177.37s -> 2186.20s]  than like mature violence. Dude, Tom and Jerry. Tom used to get like a hammer smashed on his hand
[2186.20s -> 2193.00s]  and like shot in the face and stuff. Like Jerry used to fucking torture that guy. But there was
[2193.00s -> 2220.42s]  no blood. He may have gotten like a black eye or something, right? But when Tom hit Jerry with the
[2220.42s -> 2236.06s]  hammer, sparkly, gigantic particle smoke did not come out of Tom's hand. That's the point. He got
[2236.06s -> 2249.00s]  his teeth knocked in. No, it didn't. There was no like big flash particle like camera flash
[2249.96s -> 2256.20s]  and like sparkles and big smoke. Boom! No, he's got his hand smashed with a hammer.
[2275.50s -> 2279.26s]  Okay, all right. I'm moving on from this. We've been on this for too long.
[2287.50s -> 2294.82s]  I'm gonna try to do this one again. How will you know if it's next gen if there's not millions of
[2294.82s -> 2303.88s]  particles? You know, that's probably the reason why a lot of games slow down too. Is that what
[2303.88s -> 2308.82s]  happened? Have we plateaued in graphics that we have not plateaued in the amount of shit that they
[2308.82s -> 2330.73s]  can put on the screen in particle effects? I think you figured it out. Style is becoming more
[2330.73s -> 2347.19s]  important. Today is the particle rant stream. Not. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Yeah,
[2347.19s -> 2352.97s]  it takes way too long. All right. I don't want to fall in the lava, but man you got to fight
[2352.97s -> 2366.71s]  the people down there. That sucks. Is this game good? This game is very good. It's really difficult
[2366.71s -> 2372.84s]  for me to rate it and tell you, like, you shouldn't. This game is really not very good at all.
[2373.40s -> 2378.50s]  I really recommend you don't purchase it. It's probably the worst in the series, out of the three
[2378.50s -> 2397.21s]  at least, in the main series. No, it's good. It's really good. I think this is probably my favorite
[2397.21s -> 2411.06s]  one out of the three. This is my last time I'm going to try this. I've been, okay, the amount of
[2411.06s -> 2415.22s]  time I've taken trying to do this mission, I could have already made ten thousand dollars doing the
[2415.22s -> 2439.02s]  fight missions. Oh, let's not screw it up this time. Hang on, right? I don't even want to know
[2439.02s -> 2445.94s]  what level three this is, or level four. It's probably so awful. All right, nothing this way,
[2445.94s -> 2456.52s]  right? I have plenty of time. I'm not worried about the time. Move out of the fucking way.
[2457.32s -> 2458.76s]  All right, let's go this way.
[2466.90s -> 2475.72s]  Oh, he did a Lord of the Rings beatbox. He's done that, like, a thousand times. I've heard
[2475.72s -> 2480.60s]  that a million times before. He doesn't have any other material in his jukebox.
[2495.75s -> 2502.36s]  My voice is already fucked up this morning. I'm yelling at WarioWare, the 35-year-old man.
[2505.00s -> 2506.20s]  That's something I have to live with, you know.
[2513.54s -> 2516.50s]  About 36 yet. Stop saying that. It's not accurate yet.
[2521.14s -> 2525.80s]  All right, what about up? Yeah, there's one up there. Is there anything left over here?
[2527.00s -> 2535.78s]  God, I don't know. Jesus. Oh my god, it didn't register. It didn't register the click.
[2535.78s -> 2545.34s]  Holy shit. Okay, I'm good. All right, I gotta go up this way. Where is this?
[2549.29s -> 2563.61s]  Shut up. Four, okay, five, six. Don't fall in the middle. It's so easy to not fall in the middle.
[2567.11s -> 2568.47s]  I don't, there's no timer right now.
[2571.74s -> 2579.06s]  Goodness. Don't dodge into the fire.
[2579.86s -> 2595.05s]  I don't know. Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
[2605.16s -> 2607.42s]  What the fuck? All right, I'm good.
[2611.86s -> 2615.14s]  Five, okay, there's one more. I don't know where it is, though. Wait for this to flood.
[2616.10s -> 2626.07s]  Do I still eat dairy? Um, a little. I don't drink any real milk or anything, except for like a milkshake or ice cream or cheese.
[2627.27s -> 2633.05s]  Oh, I mean, I don't, not really. Here it is. All right, get me out of here.
[2636.65s -> 2643.78s]  Yeah, I mean, I do. I still eat dairy. It's only from cheese and ice cream, though. That's really it.
[2654.26s -> 2661.64s]  You see that? If I want, like, milk in my coffee or milk with a brownie or something,
[2661.64s -> 2673.48s]  it's usually almond milk or oat milk. One of those two. Cheese tier list? I've already
[2673.48s -> 2685.83s]  did all the tier lists. New level is unlocked. All right, let's just see what it looks like
[2685.83s -> 2693.98s]  because it's here. Oat milk is filled with canola oil. Omega-Lel. Yeah, and apples have cyanide in it.
[2693.98s -> 2697.50s]  Whatever. I'll see you in 10 years when they realize. See you in 25 years when drinking
[2697.58s -> 2713.53s]  coffee actually kills you. I don't care. This is the banana radiation thing again. I don't care.
[2714.25s -> 2721.59s]  Coffee's supposed to be good for your heart. Yeah, whatever. I'll see you in 50 years when
[2721.59s -> 2726.39s]  they realize that there's like a micro organism in coffee that is giving us all like diseases.
[2728.23s -> 2732.63s]  Okay, here's the real point. Everything sucks. Everything is bad for you. Eventually.
[2742.71s -> 2755.91s]  I canceled it. I'm good. All right, well, that was cool. I need 50,000. I do a couple more missions.
[2760.28s -> 2766.82s]  Coffee's worms. It has worms in it. Yeah, I don't know. Whatever. Here's the point. Treat your body
[2766.82s -> 2776.30s]  well with whatever data and science that we have now and that's it. Just, you know, eat what you
[2776.30s -> 2782.38s]  want. Eat whatever you feel. Do whatever you want. Moderate it. Don't be crazy. Don't be out of your
[2782.38s -> 2787.02s]  mind and like, oh, I only eat fucking McDonald's number twos. Like, don't do that. That's a dumb
[2787.02s -> 2795.16s]  thing to do. Some light exercise if you need to and you look and then in like 100 years
[2795.80s -> 2801.96s]  they'll look back and they'll be like, are you kidding me? They were they were putting sugar.
[2801.96s -> 2811.16s]  They were eating sugar. What were they thinking? Just wait. There will be a what were they thinking
[2811.90s -> 2817.56s]  reference for like the generations in 100 years and like, hold on a minute guys. What are you?
[2817.56s -> 2827.19s]  What are you serious? They were eating the fruits off of trees. What? No, they were not. Why would
[2827.19s -> 2838.74s]  they do that? We'll see in like 200 years. They were eating. They were eating wait meat from a cow.
[2838.74s -> 2842.42s]  What the fuck? No, they were not. I don't believe that for a second. How could they do that?
[2843.14s -> 2858.46s]  There'll be something. Just you just wait. We'll see what it is. They were drinking water.
[2861.22s -> 2864.74s]  I don't know, man. There's there'll be something that we're doing right now
[2864.74s -> 2868.58s]  that generations in the future are going to be shocked that we even thought it was a decent
[2868.58s -> 2873.46s]  idea in the first place. I don't know what it is, but we won't know.
[2875.70s -> 2886.82s]  Oh, we've got a whole combo on them.
[2895.18s -> 2910.84s]  First down. I say I saw somebody say that oxygen was poisonous.
[2912.41s -> 2929.05s]  Um, I don't I don't want to get too into this. I don't know. I who said that? It is. I don't know.
[2929.05s -> 2932.81s]  That's that's an unconfirmed statement. I can't I can't agree or deny that one.
[2932.97s -> 2939.59s]  It's unconfirmed. We read that shit every day. That's unconfirmed to me. I mean, technically,
[2939.59s -> 2953.30s]  it could be. Yeah, but isn't it like a blend? Don't we have an air cocktail that's not just
[2953.30s -> 2958.10s]  oxygen? So I okay, maybe that might that might be accurate. I don't know. Yeah, we have an air
[2958.10s -> 2971.78s]  cocktail. I get it. Yeah, whatever. It's like, I don't know, like hydrogen, oxygen,
[2971.78s -> 2972.90s]  hydrogen, oxygen,
[2976.22s -> 2981.69s]  or ander, cadmium, whatever they are. There's all kinds of shit in our ear.
[2982.49s -> 3007.19s]  Just said, Dude, German, you are on hard drugs. No, you are right now seeing the reason why I was
[3007.19s -> 3015.86s]  always afraid of ever doing a hard drug ever. I am completely drug free. But the exception
[3015.86s -> 3024.78s]  is Tylenol, caffeine, a little bit of marijuana. I'm feeling okay. No drug free, man. I don't.
[3027.19s -> 3049.59s]  I have no way. Don't do those all together. I'm no, I'm not. I'm I'm talking about in
[3049.59s -> 3061.27s]  separate occasions. No, I look, you don't need more than that. Let's be really realistic here.
[3063.62s -> 3067.38s]  Really, really hard shit that like really fucks you up and stuff. No, no, just I'll just I'll
[3067.38s -> 3072.42s]  take a little bit of weed is fine. That's it. That's kind of I don't need alcohol, maybe a
[3072.42s -> 3080.30s]  little bit sometimes. No, that's anything more than that. No, it's not. It's not good. It's
[3080.30s -> 3087.61s]  not good for you. Fucks up. You've had screws with you. This is what like no, I need ATM.
[3088.33s -> 3115.40s]  Where's your ATM? Oh, right here. What about psychedelics? Um, I don't I don't know enough
[3115.40s -> 3123.80s]  about them. I know that there's some preliminary data right of people. There being some drug
[3123.88s -> 3130.04s]  companies or some pharmaceutical companies that are experimenting with like low dose of psychedelics
[3130.04s -> 3137.42s]  to treat some mental disorders, mental health problems, right? I don't know. I've heard that.
[3141.78s -> 3150.90s]  I don't know. We'll see in like another 20 years. What happens 15 years? I'm afraid of them and I
[3150.90s -> 3164.86s]  don't ever want to do them. They're experimenting with shrooms. I mean, I know that there is some
[3164.86s -> 3171.34s]  drug companies that are that have programs. Let's study. That's deep, man. Very, very low doses of
[3173.06s -> 3179.02s]  some psychedelics can actually help. I don't know. It's just really random shit that I have read.
[3182.49s -> 3192.31s]  I have that correct, correct, right? We used to drink this after school. Yeah, okay.
[3192.31s -> 3201.43s]  I always got muscat and you always got kyoho. The sweetness of the grape really invigorates a tired
[3201.43s -> 3211.37s]  body. It was a little treat to myself for working hard. That stuff was good. It's all coming back
[3211.37s -> 3219.03s]  to me now. So you remember things too, huh? You have like Greece and all? For most things,
[3219.03s -> 3226.31s]  I sort of have to gather the pieces together or I can't remember. I see. So you are a victim too.
[3227.27s -> 3229.99s]  In that case, can't you just give up on this planet?
[3231.13s -> 3238.06s]  Sonic? Are you being serious? Yes. I think it's worth considering.
[3239.02s -> 3243.02s]  I can't back down. You should know this. My family's destiny.
[3244.46s -> 3252.25s]  That stuff again. Is that Charles from Red Dead? It is. Same actor. That's not gonna work. I mean,
[3252.25s -> 3261.45s]  Sonic? Will not back out. I will follow your orders, but I do hope that you will back out.
[3262.66s -> 3274.76s]  Future? Can you see it? I'm not sure. I must go. What's the future like? I will tell you when I
[3274.76s -> 3289.80s]  get back. Make sure you come back, Sonic Juice. Next time, let's try some peach juice. Yeah,
[3290.28s -> 3298.73s]  I would. I can't do psychedelics. I would never do it. I like to be close to.
[3299.69s -> 3303.45s]  I don't like the idea of being able to be potentially disconnected from reality. I feel
[3303.45s -> 3308.17s]  like I would have a panic attack. I think I would have a meltdown or something. I don't know if I
[3308.17s -> 3316.52s]  could do it. No, I don't think so. And that's okay, right? That's completely fine. I don't
[3316.52s -> 3324.81s]  have to do any of those things. I know the things that I know that I can do and I can handle.
[3327.94s -> 3333.46s]  Obviously, I don't want to make sure I'm not like get hurt or hurt myself or something in the
[3333.46s -> 3340.41s]  process, right? You want to even with something like that, like marijuana or alcohol, you're
[3340.41s -> 3343.53s]  going to be careful. You don't want to just like walk up and fuck your head up and shit. And, you
[3343.53s -> 3347.69s]  know, think about I think about how many times or people, you know, have you heard of somebody
[3347.69s -> 3357.56s]  that like, you know, you drink too much, right? That's that sucks. That sucks. All these things
[3357.56s -> 3365.56s]  come with potential consequences. Just to be careful. All right. Do I have enough to do this?
[3368.49s -> 3381.38s]  I definitely do. All right. Do I care about health or damage? I feel like I'm whooping
[3381.38s -> 3397.26s]  everybody's ass. So might as well dial that up to 100. Nice. What's the best way to lose weight?
[3397.26s -> 3401.59s]  I really don't know. I've never been in that position before where I've had to.
[3402.70s -> 3408.14s]  So I'm not the one that can answer that question for you. I have enough to do this.
[3408.78s -> 3432.65s]  Oh, I don't have enough money to buy these calories in calories out. Yeah, I was. I mean,
[3433.61s -> 3439.32s]  if I were to try to do it, which I'll be honest, probably I'm probably gonna have to do that
[3441.34s -> 3451.50s]  because I like slingshot of myself. I lost a bunch of weight a year or two ago,
[3453.13s -> 3457.93s]  all the medical bullshit. And then I gained it back. And I tried to get like on a program
[3457.93s -> 3466.17s]  to get it all back. And then it kept going. And then I kept going. So I went from 129 or
[3466.17s -> 3473.14s]  I think my lowest, I was 128 pounds. And then I went from that to like 145. And I was like,
[3473.14s -> 3477.54s]  all right, this is perfect. I'm done. I did it. And then like a couple, like three or four months
[3477.54s -> 3482.63s]  later, I looked at the scale and I was like, holy shit, I'm 163 pounds. How? When did that happen?
[3485.13s -> 3492.58s]  Like I went way too far back and way too far forward. I gained like an extra 10 pounds in
[3492.58s -> 3502.98s]  like three or four months somehow. So now I have to kind of eventually here, I got to do the pull
[3502.98s -> 3509.88s]  back where I get a little bit more physically active, some more weight training, maybe very
[3509.88s -> 3517.59s]  lightly, but it's hard because kind of chest and back problem that I have. It's kind of a pain in
[3517.59s -> 3523.13s]  the ass to exercise for more than a few times because I'll exercise and I'll be like, okay,
[3523.13s -> 3527.61s]  cool. That was a nice workout. And the next two or three days, it's like, oh my God, I can't even
[3527.61s -> 3532.70s]  move. So it's actually kind of hard to do that, but I need to get to doing some light stuff.
[3532.70s -> 3536.71s]  Maybe like kind of doing an elliptical or jogging or something just to drop a little bit of the
[3536.71s -> 3550.17s]  weight. I'm back down to like 155, 150 maybe I'll be happy at like 155. I will. You used to be so
[3550.17s -> 3560.84s]  yoked. Yeah, I was, I was, I was, I was an absolute stack of shit like 10 years ago. So I get to be
[3560.84s -> 3565.30s]  that person. Now that's like, Hey, you know, 10 years ago, you should have seen me. I never
[3565.30s -> 3572.49s]  didn't know what that was going to be like to actually say that. But now here we are.
[3572.49s -> 3583.54s]  That's a weird feeling. This is versus the Sonic guy. This is number three, right?
[3587.77s -> 3595.29s]  The number three ranked assassin is Sonic juice, Sonic occupation, demon God. He is known as who's
[3595.29s -> 3603.37s]  right hand. He's like the one you to foos Liu Bei. He's even called the one you of space.
[3604.33s -> 3610.57s]  Let all your madness out, Travis. Welcome to the garden of insanity.
[3611.61s -> 3616.38s]  As long as you're healthy. Yeah, that's the point. I never want to go too far or too,
[3617.34s -> 3621.42s]  too low, right? I want to go kind of something be somewhere in the middle.
[3622.14s -> 3631.51s]  But like, look, I still, I still want to enjoy, you know, oh, I'm going to go eat out. Yeah,
[3631.51s -> 3635.67s]  I'll take her. I would love like a fucking nice big like juicy cheeseburger.
[3636.47s -> 3641.42s]  All right. Also like, you know, I would enjoy I'll take like a grilled chicken salad with some,
[3642.22s -> 3647.82s]  you know, fresh greens and stuff. I just, I don't want to have anything off limits to myself.
[3647.82s -> 3661.40s]  Right. Okay. I only have the heels. You're going to look like a boxing glove soon. I'm trying to
[3661.40s -> 3667.69s]  picture what that what you're trying to say. And I'm having trouble. Because what does that mean?
[3668.41s -> 3676.33s]  Like top heavy and like big, big, big up top and small. A boxing glove is just big all around.
[3683.32s -> 3691.90s]  Big. Remember, you have really long teeth. Can I have one of them?
[3692.54s -> 3702.70s]  The day that I like sell a tooth to a viewer is the day where I have truly it's truly over.
[3703.75s -> 3712.04s]  It's just over. And it's time to pack up shop and close the door. All right, let's do it.
[3712.76s -> 3731.45s]  Oh, it's this guy. He's actually always inside of that thing. I didn't even know he was in there.
[3736.57s -> 3743.77s]  This is taking way too long. How long is this guy going to walk? Just be patient. Oh, it's so damn
[3743.77s -> 3750.57s]  long. He's probably tired. For real. This is fucking long. He might be injured. Isn't this
[3750.57s -> 3757.29s]  just a huge waste of time? Just chill. Okay. We start getting antsy. We lose. What the fuck is
[3757.29s -> 3769.67s]  the point of this? He's just fucking with us now. Right. He's getting closer. This is actually
[3769.67s -> 3781.59s]  starting to freak me out a little. Is he smoking? These are bong rips. Who's doing that? Oh, it's the
[3781.59s -> 3803.21s]  cat purring. Oh, the slowed down music. This is like a high scene. Gene, it's time. Sorry for the
[3803.21s -> 3811.06s]  wait. I'm fine. But the younger gamers don't like waiting for shit. And that five minutes probably
[3811.06s -> 3819.14s]  caused a lot of them to scrap this game. Yeah. Good point. Hey, young gamers. I'm terribly sorry.
[3819.14s -> 3828.47s]  Young gamers. You don't have to go that far. And you've probably got in cold standing out here.
[3829.70s -> 3833.38s]  Don't worry about it. I've hated the sea since I was a kid. That's all.
[3835.22s -> 3844.38s]  Look like a warrior. So even earth has some good soldiers too. I'm no fucking soldier. I'm a goddamn
[3844.38s -> 3851.02s]  killer. Anyone getting in my way gets killed. I'm a passing assassin. I like this area. You don't
[3851.02s -> 3858.10s]  look like a bad soldier. Either way, if you're going to take us down, you must be pretty tough.
[3859.54s -> 3864.74s]  Fuck head. This ain't the pub. I didn't come here to shoot the shit with coworkers and have a few
[3864.74s -> 3872.82s]  beers after work and go home. We're going to fight to the death. Let me ask you this. Why do you want
[3872.82s -> 3880.26s]  to kill me? If you're going to fuck up my town, I don't give a shit who you are. You're my enemy.
[3880.34s -> 3886.50s]  So I got to kill you. That's all. I'll be honest with you. I don't agree with fool,
[3887.22s -> 3890.98s]  but because this planet is evil, it must be conquered and rolled over.
[3892.66s -> 3903.38s]  But for some reason, I'm unable to find the roots of evil in your people. Join me. You may be a good
[3903.38s -> 3912.30s]  species. Join me and together we can destroy the sea. I'll never join you. Even if that were indeed
[3912.30s -> 3917.58s]  the case, I cannot deny that I am unable to ascertain the point of fighting you.
[3918.54s -> 3922.22s]  What's he got to say about it? Who do you mean by he?
[3923.67s -> 3933.82s]  Ah, you mean this. I got no idea how this works. It is an avatar, a physical and a robot.
[3933.82s -> 3939.58s]  It is an avatar. Wait, he kind of looks like avatar. Okay. I think I get it. Is this an avatar joke?
[3940.06s -> 3948.98s]  Kind of don't know then. Let us negotiate this. No need for any of that. You just get the fuck out
[3948.98s -> 3959.35s]  of this town. You willing to back off? That is going to be rather difficult. Fool is terrifying.
[3959.35s -> 3965.91s]  If I were to disobey him, my entire species would be wiped out. Airbender. No, like avatar,
[3965.91s -> 3973.51s]  James Cameron avatar. A place as beautiful as this. This world was purged. It's civilizations
[3973.51s -> 3980.57s]  decimated. Left with nothing but a legacy of death. I guess that settles it then. We're
[3980.57s -> 3987.93s]  destined to fight. In that case, let's do it this way. I am no good with action type stuff. So
[3988.57s -> 3994.25s]  let's do this RPG style. Oh God. Why not fight in the genre of our liking, right?
[3995.69s -> 4005.48s]  Speak for yourself, buddy. I'm all action or GTFO. Now you're trying to push your own preferences on
[4005.48s -> 4018.39s]  me. Allow me to demonstrate my power. Encounter. Ah, yes. God. Right. This is how we fight. Hey,
[4018.39s -> 4024.95s]  what the hell? I can't move. What the hell is going on? Oh, come on. You're a gamer, aren't you?
[4024.95s -> 4033.03s]  I shouldn't need to explain this to you. My beam katana won't fucking move. It's gonna be a turn
[4033.03s -> 4043.42s]  based fight. Legendary water. We got to attack with command input. We really we take turns attacking.
[4043.42s -> 4050.90s]  It's an extremely fair way to do battle. Oh, I don't like this. So this is RPG style, huh?
[4052.10s -> 4060.98s]  Maybe break my damn controller. So what? So you don't know what you're certainly behind the times.
[4062.38s -> 4070.38s]  Nope. Even if they I'm not going anywhere near it. Are they bleeping? Why not? What reason could you
[4070.38s -> 4077.61s]  have to be so stubborn about it? This must be Final Fantasy. They bleep in Final Fantasy.
[4088.04s -> 4096.92s]  You know, you're right. They look so what? I had been totally blind to that. I never noticed.
[4098.12s -> 4102.60s]  You know, but what I think really hard about it, I think it did sort of feel that way. After all,
[4102.60s -> 4107.80s]  I mean, all the revolutionary technology paired with the sheer branding power that is
[4107.80s -> 4117.38s]  is couldn't face the reality that the characters look absolutely. Well, don't beat yourself up
[4117.38s -> 4124.58s]  over it. It can be two things. Everyone and their mom shitty. And at the same time, the characters
[4124.58s -> 4132.26s]  do look shit. Nobody's at fault here. Not even designs are at fault. Wow. This is I feel like
[4132.26s -> 4139.62s]  this is like a shot take here. Looks like you really are a crazed psycho killer. After all,
[4139.62s -> 4144.90s]  this is really suit of 50 ones Willy Wonka Castle. Like this is everything. Follow your lead
[4144.90s -> 4161.35s]  off to the world of RPGs. Okay, so here we go. Let's go. Juiced has not yet noticed. Are you
[4161.35s -> 4179.91s]  serious? Okay. Fight, fight. Two damage. That's it. Building power up. This one looks tough.
[4180.55s -> 4191.74s]  Okay, what about item herb times 10? Run. Can I just run? You can't run away. I wasted a turn.
[4192.70s -> 4202.28s]  Shit. 65 damage. All right, hold on. Magic. Fire. Blizzard. Thunder. I'm gonna try fire.
[4203.51s -> 4213.35s]  Fire. Not enough MP. What? Sonic juice special attack. Legendary water gun. I don't have enough
[4213.35s -> 4227.94s]  MP. That hurt a lot. Is it battery? Summon. No, not yet. Charge. Oh, okay. Do I have to
[4228.58s -> 4240.38s]  do anything? Building up power. Okay. Magic. Fire. What do you mean not enough MP? What are you
[4240.38s -> 4253.03s]  talking about? Where's my MP? Okay. How about summon? I'm just gonna summon somebody.
[4255.11s -> 4264.79s]  Bahamut is off on vacation. Sonic juice special attack. Legendary water gun. I think I just have
[4264.79s -> 4277.91s]  to hit him. Fight. Summon. Charge. Okay, fight. System window? Wait, I can attack? Wait, come
[4277.91s -> 4295.24s]  back. What? What the fuck is this? Are you serious? Okay, that's funny. But wait, I don't want to do
[4295.24s -> 4312.42s]  that first because I'm able to see what I'm doing. 150 damage. I have herb. All right, item item item.
[4312.42s -> 4320.47s]  Take an herb. 1000 HP restored. Okay, cool. Sonic juice special attack. Legendary water.
[4324.25s -> 4327.85s]  I'm gonna attack the thing on the left first because that's info I don't really care about.
[4330.07s -> 4345.90s]  360. Summon again? Summon. Knights of the round table. The round table meeting has gone into
[4345.90s -> 4361.85s]  overtime. I still have plenty of health. All right, fight. I want to kill this thing. All right,
[4361.85s -> 4367.53s]  that thing's dead. But I want to be able to still fight. So if I get rid of that, will I?
[4370.60s -> 4381.00s]  Wait a minute. If I get rid of this. Oh shit. If I kill this, will I be able to move?
[4382.68s -> 4399.50s]  I wonder if I just kill this, I can move around. Try a different magic. I don't have MP. Blizzard.
[4400.14s -> 4412.14s]  I don't have MP. Sonic juice special attack. Legendary water. Dry thunder for a clean machine.
[4412.62s -> 4420.50s]  Oh yeah, let's try thunder. I can do thunder. Your beam cannon is overflowing with power.
[4421.62s -> 4431.74s]  Shit, all right, hold on. Try attack him? I'm gonna kill the system window. Attack doesn't reach.
[4431.74s -> 4449.11s]  Fuck. Wait, what? Can I do thunder again? What should I hit with this? Him? Oh, that's a critical
[4449.11s -> 4460.15s]  hit. That does damage. That's 700 damage. Okay. I don't think I want to kill the thing on the
[4460.15s -> 4471.59s]  bottom. If I kill the command window, can I even attack him? I'm gonna try. We'll see what happens.
[4471.59s -> 4496.41s]  Whatever. I wonder if it lets me move around. Okay. Yeah, I'll heal.
[4499.29s -> 4506.23s]  I don't know how much health I have. Let's see. Um, probably like 1,400?
[4508.71s -> 4522.20s]  All right, what happens if I do this? That's enough of this JRPG bullshit. Oh, okay.
[4522.20s -> 4530.57s]  I'm here on out. We're having a boss fight. Now I can move around.
[4542.74s -> 4547.38s]  Yeah.
[4560.50s -> 4567.30s]  Let's go. We're gonna push it to the limit. Oh, limit. So this is the power of light.
[4569.02s -> 4585.66s]  Let's go. I hope this song is an absolute banger. You know what I mean? Oh, that hurt.
[4589.70s -> 4593.69s]  Where is it? Fuck. All right. I got to time that better.
[4598.20s -> 4607.96s]  Fuck. Dodge better. There we go. Oh, that hurts.
[4616.92s -> 4626.38s]  Can I kick him from here? Nope. Okay. That was a bad idea. That hits him.
[4635.14s -> 4651.46s]  One punch man. There it is. There's the dodge. Can I get him here? I can reach him from here.
[4651.46s -> 4653.22s]  When he leans in, I can get him like that. All right. Good. Let's go.
[4660.14s -> 4661.18s]  Can I hit him with anything else?
[4661.18s -> 4681.70s]  I don't think so. There it is again. Go. Mustang mode. Oh my God. It's unfair.
[4681.70s -> 4694.74s]  It's so unfair to get this at a boss. It's a whole phase gone. Oh my goodness. What do I do?
[4700.33s -> 4715.86s]  Whoa. It takes up the whole screen. Get up. I don't even know what movie is doing.
[4715.86s -> 4720.68s]  Oh my God. Okay. Don't die. I just got a free phase. It's gone.
[4729.96s -> 4741.67s]  Left side. Stay all the way up. Jump. What? Oh, you got to go in the middle. I get it. Okay.
[4745.67s -> 4766.20s]  Let's get in there. All right. Two and then in the middle.
[4766.20s -> 4783.29s]  I missed. I'm in a good shape though. I'm fine. That wasn't a perfect dodge. How?
[4789.19s -> 4800.66s]  It is an MMO fight. All right. I got to get perfect dodge. Come on.
[4808.57s -> 4821.83s]  Oh, fuck. I was trying to dodge through it. All right. He's slow. No, get in there quick.
[4822.55s -> 4832.70s]  Please. All right. Don't fuck this one up. That one's easy to avoid.
[4839.35s -> 4846.14s]  All right.
[4850.81s -> 4855.21s]  In the middle. He's almost dead.
[4863.99s -> 4882.66s]  Get in close. Come on. What is he saying? Homey testo. All right. Is it? He's done.
[4886.82s -> 4893.32s]  That was a cool fight. I liked that one a lot actually. That was really cool.
[4901.56s -> 4909.72s]  What? I submit. I give up. I cannot fight pointlessly any longer. Begging for quarter,
[4909.72s -> 4915.72s]  huh? So even aliens have that sort of thing. There are people waiting for me on my planet.
[4916.60s -> 4924.42s]  I cannot die yet. Fine. You're an interesting guy.
[4930.62s -> 4938.12s]  You fucking dick prince. You're getting soft assassin. You can't beat me like that.
[4938.76s -> 4949.06s]  You're too soft. Wasn't that your friend? I've forgotten about all that old stuff.
[4949.70s -> 4954.84s]  We're in different positions now. Whatever. Let's settle this here.
[4955.72s -> 4961.08s]  Yeah. Who's who? Looks like we've got the stage all set. Bring it.
[4962.04s -> 4978.94s]  What the fuck is going on with her?
[4984.60s -> 4986.76s]  She keeps being upgraded every time we see her.
[4997.32s -> 5000.20s]  What happened to three? What happened to two?
[5017.83s -> 5018.63s]  Those eyes.
[5031.34s -> 5036.38s]  I borrowed it. A certain benevolent third party said I could use it.
[5036.38s -> 5039.74s]  Here's the copyright related stuff. Thanks a lot, your son.
[5040.97s -> 5045.37s]  With that kind of technology, I could have come to this planet without full armor.
[5046.87s -> 5054.23s]  This play of Slot Air enters the final act. Round and round, Travis. Go round and round
[5054.23s -> 5062.15s]  this hell of battle. Go round and round and round again. Oh, I almost forgot. It's time
[5062.15s -> 5067.51s]  for my beach yoga appointment. Sorry. Gotta go. Silvia, I need to talk to you.
[5069.99s -> 5095.16s]  Eyes are gone. Give me an S. See? That's too bad. The thing about this game that we're realizing,
[5095.16s -> 5102.07s]  spoilers by the way, if you don't know what we're doing. This whole list was just here for a joke.
[5102.87s -> 5106.55s]  None of this even mattered. That's kind of funny to me. Like, oh, the top 10
[5107.51s -> 5113.43s]  cosmic assassins. It didn't even matter. That's not even who we fought. More than like two-thirds
[5113.43s -> 5130.04s]  of the time. That's hilarious. You fight only like half of them, yeah. So I'm really just kind of
[5130.04s -> 5136.87s]  wondering what the last arc of this game is going to be then. If this game's entire storyline here
[5136.87s -> 5139.99s]  so far has been Suda 51 just doesn't give a shit and he's going to do whatever he wants,
[5142.49s -> 5146.95s]  what happens at the end? I have no idea what they're going to do. I have no idea what happens.
[5148.30s -> 5153.42s]  I'm more interested in what the last boss fight is even going to be than anything that we've done
[5153.42s -> 5164.81s]  so far. Like the story of what happens at the end is more important to me than that entire game.
[5165.45s -> 5186.18s]  There's probably going to be like three or four people that kill each other in a row.
[5186.18s -> 5208.07s]  We're going to get the dollhouse lawyer joke except in the actual game. It's going to be
[5208.07s -> 5219.77s]  a pog ending. Oh, sorry. I bumped you. Very curious. Everyone's just a lawyer. We're going
[5219.77s -> 5258.33s]  to get overstimulated again. Don't talk through the intro. Ranking the chair at the same.
[5264.22s -> 5271.42s]  Noah makes me cave perfect. He's even good at period pieces. Here it is. The big three period
[5271.42s -> 5278.94s]  pieces. The best one has got to be 13 assassins, right? After that, it's ninja kids. Harakiri,
[5278.94s -> 5285.66s]  death of a samurai is a masterpiece too. The casting is amazing. Who's this cool ass Japanese
[5285.66s -> 5293.66s]  dude? Yeah, Takayuki is great. That sort of instability is awesome. Takayuki isn't acting.
[5293.66s -> 5301.90s]  He's swimming in the sea of imagery. Kubota is going to go places too. Kubota? From Katai
[5301.90s -> 5310.54s]  investigator seven? That's one good looking dude. Is that the medic? Yeah. He's awesome.
[5310.54s -> 5317.58s]  But Nobuaki is hella sweet. Not enough can be said about Mieke's delinquent movies.
[5317.58s -> 5324.06s]  He totally gets the fine line between delinquent and Yakuza. Let's give credit where it's deserved.
[5324.06s -> 5330.86s]  Our standings for the world of grownups. He really burns depth and fear into his imagery.
[5330.86s -> 5342.36s]  Fuck, Mieke is so awesome. For real. It's a bad chill. I haven't even started over your dead body
[5342.36s -> 5353.43s]  yet. I'm gonna go outside real quick. I will, let's go on record here. I think that any voice
[5353.43s -> 5363.21s]  actor I've ever heard, I think Robin Ackendowns is the absolute best. He's got the best exclamation
[5363.21s -> 5370.89s]  sound. No one comes close. In the entire industry. I'm not gonna be able to do it,
[5370.89s -> 5375.61s]  but that like, whoa, like whoa, like no one, literally nobody can do it but him.
[5376.25s -> 5388.60s]  He's got the best exclamations in the entire industry. You know the one I'm talking about too.
[5390.26s -> 5409.56s]  His yelling and his exclamatory way of talking is just unbeatable. He's the best in the English
[5409.64s -> 5420.26s]  VA scene. Yeah, I would say he's probably up there in the top five at least. Top 10 without a doubt.
[5420.90s -> 5430.84s]  All right, let's change the clothes here. I feel like this is gonna be one of the last,
[5431.96s -> 5436.68s]  this is gonna be one of the last t-shirts. Let's make it count.
[5444.55s -> 5459.48s]  I kind of like this one. That's the new one. Are we gonna need anything else besides that?
[5473.96s -> 5481.86s]  Hmm, put on the fuck racism one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah, this is the one.
[5484.01s -> 5509.54s]  Yeah, I think we end the game with this. I want some more color. I want like reds, teals, blues,
[5510.18s -> 5515.96s]  Robin's egg blue, bright green. All the t-shirts are like just white with black.
[5515.96s -> 5523.48s]  It's just a white t-shirt with like a black print. I want more than just white t-shirts.
[5524.04s -> 5529.19s]  I have to find them probably, right? The ones that you just get for doing the game.
[5529.99s -> 5540.87s]  All the t-shirt aliens, I need to find them. I want like a bright orange shirt,
[5540.87s -> 5547.93s]  or like bright yellow or something. The boss t-shirts are all white with black logos.
[5547.93s -> 5560.86s]  Ah, that makes sense, yeah. Well, this is different. You got a mail from someone mysterious.
[5563.06s -> 5570.18s]  Okay, what is it? Order of the Emerald Knight. Wait in the motel parking lot.
[5570.18s -> 5574.66s]  My cross sword craves your blood. Once you're ready, come out to the motel parking lot.
[5577.45s -> 5609.90s]  Uh, okay. Let's check on bad girl. Hey old man, I got a bad feeling. What is it,
[5609.90s -> 5613.82s]  you gonna tell me my fortune or something? If you were a getter, then I'd believe you,
[5613.82s -> 5618.73s]  but anything else is just bullshitting. I got no idea what that means, but this town is filled
[5618.73s -> 5623.93s]  with evil. You better watch your back. Whatever may come, I'll protect this town. You don't have
[5623.93s -> 5642.18s]  to worry. I just walked around that room like it was Resident Evil 2. Seven viewer Andy. That's
[5642.18s -> 5647.14s]  because I don't stream long enough. Do you understand? I turn my broadcast on and turn
[5647.14s -> 5654.04s]  it off in 30 seconds. You're not going to get engagement that way, Travis. Um, do I want to do
[5654.04s -> 5672.76s]  this right now? I guess. Yeah, let's do it. You should do a one minute stream. I've thought about
[5672.76s -> 5676.84s]  doing that joke before where I turn the stream on and turns off in five minutes, but I mean,
[5676.84s -> 5681.48s]  people's notifications don't even come in that it's just awful. This just fucks up everybody's
[5682.68s -> 5690.20s]  timeline. Battle is all about rhythm. If you can pick up on certain rules and signs, you could
[5690.20s -> 5709.32s]  leave your body to the rhythm and simply let yourself dance to it. But even so, you know,
[5709.32s -> 5718.52s]  having a brother like you, it's fucking embarrassing. You retweet asshole. How many times must I say this?
[5718.52s -> 5724.76s]  I saw a movie about God and it just flowed through me like electricity. I realized the
[5724.76s -> 5729.08s]  anguish of having such a good for nothing little brother and came to the conclusion
[5729.08s -> 5735.00s]  that I have to stop you. Yeah, no thanks. Quit getting in my way with your personal bullshit.
[5736.04s -> 5746.49s]  Hey, do you remember? Nope. Listen, little brother, it was a snowy day. We three siblings
[5746.49s -> 5752.57s]  made our escape from our serial killer father. In TSA, he watched the movie Thor and joined a
[5752.57s -> 5759.59s]  cult because of it. And you were crying as you ran. We spent days and days in the woods.
[5760.23s -> 5766.71s]  We built an igloo out of the snow to escape the cold. We had finally found our way to a major road.
[5767.59s -> 5775.27s]  Those huge cars moved in and surrounded us. We heard the sound of the rocks. The adults,
[5775.27s -> 5782.18s]  they took us and they tied us up. After that, I lost all my memories. I had them overwritten
[5782.18s -> 5790.58s]  with those of a child born to the cool down family. So fucking what? This is something you
[5790.58s -> 5796.18s]  got to bring up right here, right now? Right here, right now is exactly why I bring this up,
[5796.18s -> 5802.90s]  little brother. You were always crying. Keep on crying as you live, as you always have. Now,
[5803.54s -> 5810.50s]  keep on crying as you die. You really turned out fucked up, you know that? The fuck is all this
[5810.50s -> 5818.78s]  dark side bullshit? Before worrying about me, first kill that ass white. He's not my time.
[5828.26s -> 5836.07s]  This sword cuts like no other. Let's go. You fucking prevert. Hey, well again,
[5836.07s -> 5863.74s]  motel parking lot. Perfect. Fuck him up. You can't even get out of my 30 hit combo, buddy.
[5874.76s -> 5898.09s]  No, I'm on fire. All right, phase two. We're going to go into space. I hope not.
[5901.37s -> 5906.34s]  Whoa. Okay. That was bad.
[5934.47s -> 5936.87s]  Nice bit rate. I can imagine how bad it was.
[5936.87s -> 5975.80s]  It's cheating at this point. Okay. That was annoying. I couldn't touch him. Shit. Okay.
[5975.80s -> 5985.43s]  I don't have any heels left. Fuck. All right. Just play well.
[6004.57s -> 6020.90s]  Good night. I wonder how much more difficult this is on hard.
[6022.94s -> 6027.54s]  I wonder if it's going to be one of those cases where it's like way too hard on hard
[6027.54s -> 6045.51s]  and way too easy on normal. I wonder. Henry, cool down, dead. You just killed your brother.
[6046.31s -> 6054.10s]  This fight was brutal on Carolina Reaper because it's two more difficulties after you beat the
[6054.10s -> 6084.01s]  game. Right? This is horrifying. Oh, smash brothers.
[6087.85s -> 6091.05s]  That's not what I was talking about, by the way. And that's what people thought I was.
[6091.93s -> 6109.74s]  Okay. Well, so that counts as two.
[6117.90s -> 6125.02s]  That is great. Yeah. Just one left. Prince fool is waiting.
[6126.70s -> 6131.98s]  The hell is going? She lives here? Once all this fighting is over, will you listen to me?
[6131.98s -> 6142.36s]  I need to talk to you. You're right. I will think about it. They're married.
[6142.92s -> 6173.99s]  So now I have to go to a food tower. Oh, no. Okay. Are they clones? Okay. Wait,
[6173.99s -> 6186.55s]  that was the whole episode? Man, the runtime on that one. That's quite a short episode.
[6186.55s -> 6192.71s]  That's not the standard 22 minute runtime. That's the non-standard four minute runtime.
[6193.27s -> 6214.98s]  That was half of an Aquatine episode. It was filler. Non-cannon filler. That's so funny.
[6214.98s -> 6240.44s]  I hope that's accurate. Someone just said, uh-oh, budget's running low. Be careful. You know,
[6240.44s -> 6246.63s]  if I were a game company or a media company, I would make the last two episodes first. Wouldn't
[6246.63s -> 6260.33s]  you? They do that sometimes. Yeah. Like make sure you get the whole last two or three episodes
[6260.33s -> 6265.61s]  done with a ton of the money. And then you cut, you know, then cut corners when they're like
[6265.61s -> 6271.98s]  having tea in the laundry room, right? We don't need the budget for that one. I'm sure they do.
[6271.98s -> 6283.72s]  I hope they do. Most writers start at the ending. Yeah. But does this production start at the ending?
[6283.72s -> 6288.60s]  Not a lot of times, but maybe not. But you're just going to bug out here.
[6288.60s -> 6297.66s]  This shit is going to get recalled. What? Am I stuck in the bathroom?
[6298.30s -> 6306.23s]  Huh? Iwasaki? Oh, you're not there either. You got to keep the saber-related stuff in working
[6306.23s -> 6313.34s]  shape, man. Who the hell debugged this shit? Don't tell me it was their checks are way too
[6313.34s -> 6326.31s]  lax. Should have gone with. Okay. Wait, this is no bug. You assholes. Are you Henry's buddies?
[6327.27s -> 6337.96s]  You dirty fucking cosplayers. Wait, I can't fight in the bathroom? What? You screwed up.
[6337.96s -> 6345.69s]  Piece of shit. I told you as your older brother, it's my duty to kill you.
[6346.25s -> 6350.49s]  It's going to take more than this to kill my ass. That's good little brother.
[6350.81s -> 6390.62s]  We just killed him. What? Page 99. Three lives left. Okay. This is Death Man. This is the beginning
[6390.62s -> 6394.94s]  of the game. He was talking about this game that he played. This game I played. It's called Death
[6394.94s -> 6415.74s]  Man. Oh, he died in one hit. I gotta be aware of that. Good thing I had blinking so I couldn't get
[6415.74s -> 6434.70s]  hurt. Oh my god. You die by the spikes. Okay. That's good to know. I can't hurt that guy.
[6435.34s -> 6448.18s]  This is cube? I think I have to collect them or something. I thought that was a pizza. That's
[6448.18s -> 6467.30s]  cool looking. Okay. Oh, it's death. Where's death? I love the Sega Genesis sounds, though.
[6473.06s -> 6492.18s]  Death. What's that do? Death. What the hell is going on? Oh, geez. All right. I need that sword.
[6497.21s -> 6506.52s]  All right. Kill. Well, all right. I like this game. This game's fun. All right. Hit him a couple
[6506.52s -> 6555.06s]  times. What the fuck hit me? Drop it. Give me the sword. Dark Souls 2 hitboxes. No, don't get hurt.
[6555.62s -> 6566.98s]  There's too many enemies on the screen. I gotta clear. Oh, how much health does he have?
[6578.50s -> 6599.93s]  Oh, fuck you. Give it to me. Shit. Got him. All right. I think this is just, it's scripted.
[6599.93s -> 6625.14s]  You're supposed to get hurt. Okay. Who are you? A passing assassin. Well, a dead assassin now.
[6626.18s -> 6633.22s]  Welcome to the world of death, man. Let us raise a glass to death. So this is the land of death,
[6633.22s -> 6639.03s]  huh? Okay. I'm not even going to try. He's unmatched. Looks like something from an 80s
[6639.03s -> 6645.37s]  arcade game. What hardware does this run on? A death drive? No, I can't. They're not even worth
[6645.37s -> 6655.10s]  it. You can't imitate like literal gold. It's impossible. Here, take this. What's this?
[6655.98s -> 6666.76s]  Blood wine. 100 year old death emperor wine. Enjoy. You got any beer? I don't have kids drinks here.
[6668.52s -> 6678.94s]  Okay, fine then. Cheers. Congratulations, Travis. You're an uninvited guest here.
[6679.90s -> 6697.66s]  Return to the piss smelling world from whence you came. Right on. Send me back. Let's give him his
[6697.66s -> 6721.40s]  head cut off. If you die in the game, you come back to life. That's not the joke. Hey, anybody
[6721.40s -> 6731.05s]  there? Hey, I'm still alive down here. Somebody give me a hand, huh? Hello, anybody there? I'm buried?
[6732.01s -> 6745.26s]  Grave keeper! Somebody! Seriously, I'm gonna die! Let me out! Help me!
[6750.63s -> 6756.07s]  Wait, not even buried? Just sitting in a cement casket? Yeah. Thanks a lot. Wait. Seriously.
[6757.27s -> 6770.20s]  I was buried, okay. What a pinch getting buried alive. For reals? You're- My name is Miike.
[6771.08s -> 6778.04s]  You're a friend of his, right? Mr. Miike. Miike. You're reading Takashi Miike.
[6778.84s -> 6783.00s]  Are you shooting something here? Are you finally making your Hollywood debut?
[6784.04s -> 6791.08s]  Andromedia 2. No, that's not it. Ichi the Killer 2. Oh shit, I hella wanna see that. Real person
[6791.08s -> 6793.96s]  Omegalo, yeah.
[6821.45s -> 6829.37s]  I've got a request. Do you mind? What is it? I'd be happy to do whatever I can. Could you film
[6829.93s -> 6839.50s]  a live action version of No More Heroes? They're not gonna do that, are they? No, they're not.
[6840.06s -> 6845.48s]  Did they do that? Did they actually do it? Did they do at least- Please tell me they did that.
[6846.46s -> 6853.80s]  Do it. Do it! Do it! This is a bit- This game goes up full letter grade if they do it.
[6859.75s -> 6867.11s]  Battle was a success. The champ's here too. Welcome back, grandpa. You're here too.
[6868.36s -> 6872.84s]  You'll be going up against him next. Do a live action bit, please. And she's here too.
[6874.95s -> 6885.54s]  Don't worry about me. My dad took choice with you. Charlotte, the bloodlust is back in your eyes.
[6885.54s -> 6894.42s]  Don't call me that. Leave the rest to me. Oh, I don't know if they're gonna do it.
[6896.58s -> 6910.82s]  I hope they do. Please. It's about time for the climax. Oh, they don't. That's too bad.
[6911.78s -> 6916.17s]  Can you imagine if all of a sudden we saw a trailer for No More Heroes?
[6920.02s -> 6927.74s]  SSR. SSR. SSR. Wait, don't write it off yet. We're not gonna show it.
[6930.12s -> 6933.64s]  What was the point in killing him? Yeah, I don't- What was that? What even happened?
[6944.18s -> 6951.06s]  How bleak. It wasn't that long ago, but it somehow feels nostalgic. It feels like it was years ago.
[6952.86s -> 6959.42s]  Give it up for Travis. Humans aren't all bullshit after all. He's no representative of humanity.
[6959.98s -> 6968.54s]  He's just a street punk. Why do you hate him so much? Netflix. I hate punks. They're violent,
[6968.54s -> 6976.14s]  evil psychos. Kind of like you, Fu. This is my fight, but it's Travis's fight as well.
[6976.14s -> 6985.74s]  As fighters, we understand each other somewhat. But you, you don't fight. Oh, Damon. That's right.
[6985.74s -> 6995.91s]  I have nothing to do with this. I was simply dragged into it all. Think about it. Why would
[6995.91s -> 7006.07s]  Travis come here? Was it a coincidence? He's, because he's an assassin. No, you brought Travis
[7006.07s -> 7013.11s]  here. You wanted me to do it. To kill Travis. I never asked you to do that.
[7014.87s -> 7021.43s]  We're connected here. So I wanted to fulfill your wish for you. What? For me?
[7022.15s -> 7029.53s]  The final battle. Watch it up close. Watch as Travis dies.
[7031.37s -> 7065.62s]  He wants Fu to die. This is like WWE. Yeah, but Travis beats up Damon in TSA. Skipped TSA.
[7065.62s -> 7074.97s]  From a window. This game doesn't feel like it's about anything.
[7075.37s -> 7086.20s]  Master, I'm sorry for the trouble. It's cool. Let's watch some movies. Today, we're doing a
[7086.20s -> 7094.58s]  Miyake and Hideaki viewing party. So, how are your arms doing? Slowly but surely, I'm getting used
[7094.58s -> 7101.50s]  to this sensation. I can't hold my sword just yet, though. No need to rush. I want to hurry up and
[7101.50s -> 7110.41s]  help you out. What do you like, Shinobu? What do I like? I like my master. It almost feels like
[7110.41s -> 7116.33s]  Suda51 was told by his parents that you can dress yourself today. It's like what this whole
[7116.33s -> 7127.80s]  game kind of feels like. Like a little kid. It's just insane. There's a bunch of combinations that
[7127.80s -> 7138.42s]  don't make sense next to each other. You got your dad's like size 10 shoes on.
[7138.58s -> 7143.22s]  Barbados swordplay. Wearing a big styled peacock hat.
[7145.82s -> 7149.34s]  The broadsword action. And how this blouse is on. It's like going down to your knees.
[7150.86s -> 7153.82s]  Four pairs of underwear on. The right way is the way of the sword.
[7153.82s -> 7162.57s]  Times like this. Miyake and swords means blade of the immortal.
[7163.93s -> 7170.36s]  Immortal? Love the original. I'd like to watch that one. Please show me the film.
[7179.54s -> 7184.10s]  Everything just so mushed up together. There's like no rhyme or reason to anything,
[7184.10s -> 7202.55s]  but somehow there is. You can play Death Man in your room. Oh, cool. This is way too deep for you,
[7202.55s -> 7222.47s]  bro. I'm afraid to save the game. We get a pee break? Yeah, we'll do a pee break. It's been
[7222.47s -> 7231.78s]  about two hours. Do I have any money? Oh, I have enough money to do this. I'm going to spend some
[7231.78s -> 7237.51s]  of the money and then we'll take a break. I'll be right back. I might get another coffee too.
[7237.51s -> 7255.62s]  I'm only a coffee mood right now. It's so funny because this game, there's probably been a few
[7255.62s -> 7259.14s]  times where I could have told you I didn't like something in the game, but I can't tell you that.
[7259.70s -> 7264.97s]  It's weird. It may have been a handful of opportunities where I really could have been
[7264.97s -> 7271.00s]  like, yeah, this is like this. I don't like this part, but my vocal cords and my lips cannot tell
[7271.00s -> 7283.40s]  you that. They can't speak it to you for some reason. I don't know why. Oh, I think.
[7289.83s -> 7308.10s]  Hmm. Let's just dump it into the cool down. It's not in his programming. Oh, okay. The real thing
[7308.10s -> 7312.02s]  that I could tell you, which is just like, holy shit, this looks awful, is a lot of the graphics
[7312.02s -> 7315.94s]  really do feel like they're from like the Wii. It just feels like a Wii game a lot of times,
[7315.94s -> 7334.82s]  but like who cares? Like I really don't care. It's not a problem to me. Okay. It would be a
[7334.82s -> 7341.80s]  problem if the game slowed down a shit load and if it ran at a terrible frame rate or something,
[7342.36s -> 7345.64s]  and if it actually impeded the video game, I'd be like, wow, this sucks.
[7346.60s -> 7354.41s]  I don't really don't care. All right. Let's take a few break. I'll be right back.
[7355.13s -> 7358.97s]  Give me like two, three minutes. I'm going to make another coffee. Back in like a few minutes.
[7358.97s -> 7763.86s]  See you soon. Hello. Hi. Oh, I fucking fell in. What did you fall in? What did you fall in?
[7765.03s -> 7768.23s]  Oh, hey, who's in the, hello, who's in the bathroom? I'm in here.
[7769.03s -> 7783.66s]  You've been in there for a while. What'd you fall in? Let's chant. All right. Let's get back to it.
[7783.66s -> 7790.79s]  This is the final, probably last half an hour or so of this game, I would assume. I don't know.
[7792.62s -> 7819.30s]  I am ready to play. Oh, I just did that. Stop doing that. Make a convention about yourself and
[7819.30s -> 7827.14s]  call it Germacon. I got like fucking shit faced one night and I talked about rent out a whole
[7827.14s -> 7831.83s]  section of one of the casinos here and we're going to have a convention. I literally made that
[7831.83s -> 7837.24s]  reference. Uh, no, that just didn't happen. All right. Congratulations on rank two. We're
[7837.24s -> 7844.06s]  coming to inform you the entry conditions for the next battle. Uh, $60,000 is the final amount of
[7844.06s -> 7858.81s]  money you need. So designated matches are where exactly? Anywhere? Just any of the ones that I've
[7858.81s -> 7873.30s]  done already. Where is that? Um, where is who's castle or whatever it is. We're here. It's two
[7873.30s -> 7879.08s]  here. I think I can just do them anywhere then. Where am I? All right. So there's a couple here.
[7879.88s -> 7883.34s]  Well, let's do that. Let's do the one here too that I haven't done yet.
[7883.90s -> 7896.36s]  You recorded stream. Got me. What is, what is this thing you guys are writing?
[7896.92s -> 7901.64s]  Women want me. Fish want me. What, what is this? What's this a reference to? I don't get it.
[7910.42s -> 7922.84s]  It's just a case of unfunny spam. Okay. Um, streamer just told you to do something.
[7923.77s -> 7929.53s]  So I, I suggest you fucking do it. I said, stop. Streamer literally just told you to do something
[7929.53s -> 7954.86s]  and fucking stop doing it. Mods started it. Really? Monka W. Start the game. Monka W is
[7954.86s -> 7966.44s]  not a chant. It's a face. I'm sorry. Monka W is not like, it's everybody collectively in the
[7966.44s -> 7981.34s]  stadium. All going like, Oh wait, if it was Monka W it'd be imagine it was like, Oh, look
[7981.34s -> 7986.87s]  out the stadium. The stadium is doing Monka W right now. There's a bunch of people that
[7986.87s -> 7995.61s]  the whole stadium is just doing that. That's not a chant. An expression. The game is very loud now.
[8004.14s -> 8011.37s]  That person just got sniped by your own teammate. You guys can't even work together.
[8020.79s -> 8032.10s]  Verbally chanting Monka W. Why would you chant Monka W? Monka W. Monka W. Monka W. Monka W.
[8032.10s -> 8047.88s]  It'd just be like, what the fuck are these people doing? Oh, suplex machine. Isn't that
[8047.88s -> 8061.90s]  somebody's actual move in wrestling? Suplex city. This guy's almost dead. This guy's a huge pain
[8061.90s -> 8084.09s]  in the ass. All right, come on. Kill the bull. Nice. What was that move? Oh, nobody does German
[8084.09s -> 8096.78s]  suplexes. They did not do them anymore? Do they not do German suplexes in wrestling anymore?
[8097.66s -> 8120.50s]  Brock Lesnar does them all the time. It's too dangerous. Come on. Swing. Swing. You're too
[8120.50s -> 8127.91s]  slow. I don't like slow enemies. I have no health. I don't like slow enemies. They're hard to predict.
[8128.55s -> 8167.22s]  Fucking die. Stars. Yes. Invincible load activated. You can't hurt me. Funny because he showed up
[8167.22s -> 8185.62s]  yesterday in Smackdown. I didn't see what the rating was. Was it good? I was looking at chat.
[8185.62s -> 8196.39s]  You still watch wrestling? I do not. I used to like wrestling because wrestling to me was
[8196.39s -> 8203.29s]  a cartoon. It was superheroes fighting each other and just wild outrageous shit going on.
[8203.93s -> 8208.97s]  It was never supposed to be real to me. It was always like almost theater in a way.
[8210.23s -> 8215.11s]  In recent years, wrestling has tried to be a like taken as seriously as baseball.
[8217.38s -> 8230.86s]  So it's like I don't care. And yeah, I have heard that like AEW is do watch AEW watch AEW. I know,
[8230.86s -> 8246.26s]  but I think I'm probably just kind of over it too in a way. I gotta go that way. Which way am I
[8246.26s -> 8265.85s]  going here? He's a jaded old man. WWE is still hitting record profits. I mean, I didn't say
[8265.85s -> 8270.79s]  that you should not watch wrestling and it's not popular and everybody hates it. I just said the
[8270.79s -> 8274.63s]  reason why I used to watch wrestling was not because of the fact that they were wrestling.
[8275.35s -> 8281.19s]  It was like Ken Shamrock being locked in a cage and incredible hulking bending the bars like
[8281.19s -> 8291.16s]  Superman. It was Mick Foley being three different people, even though you knew he was just one guy.
[8291.16s -> 8295.56s]  Oh, there here comes Cactus Jack, a dude love. They would, they were two different people,
[8295.56s -> 8311.24s]  but it was literally just him being three or four different characters. It was like the promos,
[8311.24s -> 8316.68s]  wrestling promos. Some of them were so good. They were some of the funniest comedic actors,
[8316.68s -> 8322.07s]  like theater actors you would ever see. The magic's not there for me anymore. I think the
[8322.07s -> 8329.64s]  promos are eh. Nobody's intense anymore. Like people, it's too, I don't know, it feels like
[8329.64s -> 8340.92s]  too real life to me. The three stooges. Yeah, it was very much like slapstick comedy for me.
[8340.92s -> 8355.13s]  The last great promo machine was the rock. Yeah, it was. Got enough costumes. Yeah, I,
[8356.33s -> 8362.12s]  it was fun to have these superheroes fight each other. Just think about it. The inherent,
[8362.92s -> 8369.66s]  inherently doing like a special move to somebody doesn't do anything, right? Like, oh my god,
[8369.66s -> 8374.78s]  his finisher, the tombstone pile driver. What's the difference? It's literally you're dropping
[8374.78s -> 8381.53s]  the guy on the same mat, but they were supposed to be like superpowers. Oh no, he's doing his
[8381.53s -> 8389.21s]  finishing superpower. Now, when you take that like kind of weird costumey theater out of it,
[8389.21s -> 8394.71s]  I don't care if you have a superpower. You're just a guy with a speedo on. Like that superpower
[8394.71s -> 8399.35s]  does not hold the same weight for me. It's like, oh no, here he comes. Here comes Jeff Anderson
[8399.35s -> 8405.75s]  with his superpower taking you to the bank. I don't, you're just a guy. I don't care. Like
[8405.75s -> 8418.46s]  you don't have a superpower. The undertaker could have a superpower because he was the
[8418.46s -> 8423.18s]  undertaker. The guy literally would like raise from the dead in the middle of the ring. And there
[8423.18s -> 8429.74s]  was a fat guy on the outside who was a showman that had an urn that pretended that he was like
[8429.74s -> 8435.26s]  had power from whoever was in that urn. He was like a dead guy. And you knew it wasn't real,
[8435.26s -> 8439.82s]  but you didn't care because it was a fucking show. It was like theater. I'm going to die.
[8444.31s -> 8452.02s]  Whoa. Like if, if like Dave Anderson came out with an urn and the Paul Bearer character,
[8452.02s -> 8455.86s]  it'd be like, what? This doesn't, you, you, you can't be both at the same time.
[8456.58s -> 8461.59s]  You didn't care because it was entertaining. Yeah. It was entertainment.
[8466.74s -> 8474.62s]  I've never got Travis before. Oh yeah. Oh, that's awesome. Have you ever watched Lucha Libre? No,
[8474.62s -> 8483.35s]  I have not. I've seen some of it and like they're fucking fun. They're entertaining. I would love
[8483.35s -> 8489.34s]  to get into that because correct me if I'm wrong, but they still treat it like it's a big grand show.
[8489.34s -> 8500.55s]  Right. I kind of just don't even know where to start. All right. Hold on. I'm like not even
[8500.55s -> 8508.79s]  paying attention. I'm reading chat right now. Were you WCW or WWF fan? I was both. I liked them both
[8508.79s -> 8514.30s]  for different reasons. There was a time you can remember where like Hulk Hogan, like Macho Man,
[8514.30s -> 8525.78s]  they were in the WCW. I remember people like throwing fucking drinks into the ring.
[8528.15s -> 8534.31s]  You guys remember that? When Hulk Hogan went heel and people were literally throwing fucking
[8534.31s -> 8541.11s]  objects into the ring, like sodas and drinks and trash and shit. It was insane. Like never before,
[8541.11s -> 8545.27s]  Hulk Hogan became a bad guy and everyone was like, people were like crying in the stands.
[8545.91s -> 8563.19s]  It was crazy. Okay. This is hard. Remember the chairs? Stop throwing chairs. Yeah. People
[8563.19s -> 8569.34s]  were throwing chairs into the ring. I got to get this Mustang though. Let me pay attention.
[8569.34s -> 8579.29s]  But the point is it was really entertaining television and I know, look, I'm not going to
[8579.29s -> 8584.17s]  talk like I'm some, oh, I don't understand what happened. A lot of that shit was dangerous and
[8584.17s -> 8589.93s]  people got hurt. There was a lot of problems, you know, drugs and potential like performance
[8589.93s -> 8596.25s]  enhancing like steroids. Look, I get it, right? But it's not fun for me anymore.
[8597.13s -> 8600.97s]  And I know that you kind of have to, as we, you know, learn about how things are dangerous and
[8600.97s -> 8605.61s]  shit, like, yeah, the early to mid to late nineties. Oh, whatever. Just take a bunch of
[8605.61s -> 8610.65s]  steroids and pile driver people. Like, yeah, I get, I know that's like, you can't really do that
[8610.65s -> 8624.55s]  really anymore, right? I got to get a Mustang mode. Hold on. This level actually is probably
[8624.55s -> 8635.93s]  harder than anything in the whole game so far. I got to get a Mustang mode. All right. Here we go.
[8635.93s -> 8662.95s]  This is when you get it. No, this is where you get it. What the fuck? It's nothing because you can't
[8662.95s -> 8669.96s]  heal anymore. All right. I got to go get heals after this Japanese wrestling is still wild.
[8673.38s -> 8677.14s]  Yeah. I just, I don't know. It doesn't, it's just, it almost feels like there's no weight to it
[8677.14s -> 8696.33s]  anymore. Okay. This guy is invincible. So that's not going to happen. Apparently Jesus. This guy,
[8697.21s -> 8728.92s]  Jesus, this guy, this guy, man, Jesus, this guy, this guy, man. All right. This guy,
[8729.72s -> 8742.12s]  like this guy, really this fucking guy.
[8742.84s -> 8756.07s]  All right. Give me some, I'm getting out of here. I'm getting healed. No, I'm not. Okay. Here we go.
[8756.07s -> 8769.14s]  Last try. Don't let me down, dude. Got it. Okay. Let's go. Yeah. I have to get one slot effect and
[8769.14s -> 8802.90s]  I will win. Just need one. Come here. No, there it is. All right. Mustang mode. I'm just going to
[8802.90s -> 8827.74s]  spam X. Come on. Mustang mode again. Do it. Get away. Get away. Kill this guy. I got to kill the
[8827.74s -> 8844.73s]  other guy. This dude in the back here. All right. Now it's just me and you. I can actually do this.
[8844.73s -> 8875.78s]  Let's do it. All right. Perfecto. Let's do it. What? He was stunned. No. He got out of the way.
[8875.78s -> 8880.02s]  I had half health. You got to be kidding me. Why is this guy so, this is the hardest thing
[8880.02s -> 8902.33s]  in the whole game. This dude has an instant kill moves. The end of the PS5 game announcements.
[8902.33s -> 8914.86s]  I have not paid any attention at all. Let's go. I need to get actual heals and not just
[8915.50s -> 8920.66s]  walk to the boss fight with zero Estus flasks. I would, you would, I would never do that
[8921.38s -> 8952.01s]  ever in real life. Okay. Give me all this. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.
[8953.24s -> 8969.37s]  Okay. Bye bye. Spider-man 2 PS5. I still have to play the Miles Morales one. All right. Now where
[8969.37s -> 8982.62s]  the fuck is this thing? Where was it? Where was that fight? Isn't it over here? Yeah. Right here.
[8982.62s -> 8994.06s]  It's already marked. Let's go. Oh, wait a minute. I need to turn in. Yeah. Hold on. I got to turn
[8994.06s -> 9016.87s]  in the cards. I have a bunch of cards and I have scorpions. Say Lala right now or I will shit your
[9016.87s -> 9037.34s]  pants. Nice. Thank you. The best part about that guy is I don't know for some reason he thinks he
[9037.34s -> 9041.02s]  can like shit my pants. So he's going to like, he's going to freak out and be like, he didn't do it.
[9041.02s -> 9046.78s]  Now's my opportunity. He's going to shit his pants. Like thinking he like, he's going to cast a spell
[9046.78s -> 9050.30s]  beforehand maybe. And then he's going to shit his pants. It's like, mom's going to come in and be
[9050.30s -> 9078.30s]  like, what are you doing in here? Okay. Scorpion. Cool. You could have that as a superpower. Would
[9078.30s -> 9086.89s]  you want it? Um, what? To make people other, to wait, to shit in other people's pants as a superpower?
[9093.35s -> 9107.03s]  Um, no. Nope. You know why? Because, okay, if I was like, I'm going to make that person shit their
[9107.03s -> 9113.03s]  pants right now, there's a probability that I'm going to potentially be in their vicinity, right?
[9113.83s -> 9117.75s]  But do I just pick somebody that I, oh, I'm going to pick someone I don't like today and have them
[9117.75s -> 9122.98s]  do that? You would have to get, what, annoyed with somebody to a point where you want to use that
[9122.98s -> 9127.96s]  power, but you don't want to sit on the train with them. You know what I mean? Like you don't
[9127.96s -> 9131.00s]  want to be in the same spot as them. Why would you do it? That'd be like, I don't want to be around
[9131.00s -> 9152.06s]  that and don't use it. Yeah. I wouldn't want to. Did you ever do a Bloodborne stream? No, probably
[9152.06s -> 9158.39s]  not. I drank a few beers. I don't drink beer, but you know what I mean? You get the idea. And I
[9158.39s -> 9164.55s]  loaded up Bloodborne for like an hour one night. I've beaten that game like 15 times. It's just not
[9164.55s -> 9168.71s]  much I could even get out of it anymore, especially on stream. I don't, I would, no,
[9169.27s -> 9186.52s]  probably not. One of my favorite games ever made, but you know, nice. I didn't take off any health.
[9187.24s -> 9207.40s]  I have to wipe these guys out. These orbs are going to kill me. I feel like I'm not even hurting
[9207.40s -> 9232.17s]  these guys. All right, back it up. Oh, invincibility mode, just capitalize on it. I don't think it's on
[9232.17s -> 9267.13s]  anymore. Oh, crazy. Perfect. Get it again. Again. Again. That's it. No power replenish. I want to
[9267.13s -> 9282.89s]  heal. Where's this guy? Where's my heal, dude? What the fuck? Did I buy power replenish things?
[9282.89s -> 9308.60s]  Where's my heal? Oh my God. Oh, that was like a, that was like a Ricky out. Oh, no, I don't.
[9308.60s -> 9329.59s]  Where is my fucking heal? There it is. Finally. 40. I have to get a perfect dodge. I don't even
[9329.59s -> 9346.73s]  attack unless I get it. What are you doing? How's the automatic attack missing? Oh my God. I hate
[9346.73s -> 9370.76s]  this guy. Oh, he's dead. Fuck him. I watched season five of Rick and Morty. I don't, I've seen every
[9370.76s -> 9379.14s]  episode. I just had to see what I had to see. It's by far the worst out of all the seasons,
[9379.14s -> 9391.98s]  without a doubt. I think maybe to one episode I was like, I don't think it was very good at all.
[9391.98s -> 9409.80s]  All right, I'll be quiet. What the hell is your deal? Hey, no, mine. This is a sort of ritual.
[9411.53s -> 9422.81s]  Also a contract. I have something to give you. Here. I'm doing the Mr. Kennedy from
[9423.29s -> 9439.02s]  Resonable 4. What's this? Had it made for you. It's a mechanism of death. One befitting of you.
[9440.39s -> 9444.33s]  Wasn't this the guy that got ran over on the highway? Yeah. Simply turn on the switch when
[9444.33s -> 9453.86s]  the time comes. Stewie Griffin. Fine. There's no risk involved. No effort required. Most importantly,
[9453.86s -> 9464.94s]  there is no hassle. You could say that all it requires is anger and hatred. Can you do the Joker?
[9465.58s -> 9473.86s]  Awesome. It's not Trump. Trump and Stewie are in the same, okay, Trump and Stewie sit in the same
[9475.13s -> 9483.58s]  Venn diagram of voices. It does. This is Donald. You know, it could be. This is Stewie Griffin and
[9483.58s -> 9508.79s]  Donald. They're in the same section. They're in the same spot. This is awesome. This death is in
[9508.79s -> 9520.44s]  my hands. Look at that face. Yes, you hold death in your very hand. Don't forget. This is a contract.
[9520.44s -> 9530.97s]  The guy who spent $100 on the Family Guy mobile game. Yeah, I am not going to tell you that I did
[9530.97s -> 9542.49s]  not spend at least $50 to $150 on Family Guy the Quest for Stuff like six years ago. I did. It
[9542.49s -> 9546.89s]  could have been any other show or material. It didn't matter. The Family Guy didn't matter.
[9548.14s -> 9552.22s]  It was the act of the dopamine from playing the game is what did it to me. Why? I don't know. I
[9552.22s -> 9573.94s]  just did. I don't know why. I don't know. Okay. Golden. Gold scorpion. Family Guy whale. That is
[9573.94s -> 9586.09s]  not a whale. No. $100 in a mobile game is not a whale. $5,000. $10,000. No, it was like $60.
[9587.05s -> 9598.31s]  Are you a whale for buying like Gears of War 3 for $60? No. You bought the Mario Party game
[9598.31s -> 9606.12s]  last year for $50. Are you a whale? Whale Cope. No, it's not Whale Cope. A whale is like at least
[9606.12s -> 9623.11s]  $5,000 to $10,000 in a game. It's not like $60. Look, I saw $60. I'm not even looking at the game.
[9623.51s -> 9633.13s]  Ouch. It's a free dress-up game, you idiot. But a whale constitutes that I am one of the
[9633.13s -> 9639.21s]  sole reasons for the game's continued development. I am one of the sole reasons for that game's
[9639.21s -> 9647.05s]  financial... When they do their quarterly results. No. $50 is not a whale. You can't convince me
[9647.05s -> 9661.74s]  otherwise. I should do some of the actual jobs. Oh, lawn mowing. Definitely. You're a whale. I'm
[9661.74s -> 9667.82s]  not a whale. Okay, if I had spent like $1,000, first of all, I would never have even told you
[9667.82s -> 9675.26s]  guys that. If I spent like $5,000 in a free-to-play mobile game, no one is going to know that.
[9677.05s -> 9681.61s]  Besides my credit card company. Why would I ever tell you that? I'm not going to tell you that.
[9681.61s -> 9694.14s]  You guys are just... No way. What about Hearthstone? Yeah, how much money have you guys spent on
[9694.14s -> 9698.31s]  Hearthstone? Some of you that have played it. That were playing years ago too. How much money
[9698.31s -> 9705.69s]  have you spent on Hearthstone? If I'm allowed to spend $50. If I'm not allowed to spend $50
[9705.69s -> 9710.17s]  in Family Guy the Quest for Stuff, you're not allowed to spend $4,000 in Hearthstone.
[9710.17s -> 9729.85s]  Volunteer level one. Ask your viewers from 2018. Not us.
[9731.45s -> 9752.41s]  A Hearthstone. A Hearthstone. A Hearthstone Adventure. Remember that one from 2018?
[9753.45s -> 9759.64s]  You remember that one? Remember when I did that? Remember when I thought it was really, really funny?
[9760.28s -> 9822.62s]  I do. This mind is decaying. No, it's not. It's evolving. Turn. Turn. All right. This is going
[9822.62s -> 9842.60s]  to be at least silver, right? Silver. Gold. Yeah. Silver. Watch Chris Angel Mindfreak on stream.
[9842.60s -> 9847.67s]  Something funny about Chris Angel Mindfreak is somebody that lives in Vegas. When I first got
[9847.67s -> 9852.87s]  here, they're like, oh, what should I do? Should I watch a show? I wonder, is there something I
[9852.87s -> 9859.43s]  should do on the strip? Chris Angel's Mindfreak live show, I believe at the time, had like a 1.2
[9859.43s -> 9864.79s]  out of 5. It apparently was one of the worst shows in Vegas. I remember reading reviews and being
[9864.79s -> 9873.10s]  like, holy shit. People said this show was like the fucking worst thing they've ever done. It's
[9873.10s -> 9879.32s]  like, wow. A ton of the reviews were just like, this is a waste of time. This sucked. I was like,
[9879.32s -> 9896.23s]  oh my god. I'm not doing this. I have seen Penn and Teller though, and they were good. They were
[9896.23s -> 9923.02s]  cool. That was a really nice show. Penn and Teller are actually good. Penn and Teller are
[9923.02s -> 9931.14s]  fucking legendary. I kind of base my opinion on somebody based on what they think about Penn and
[9931.14s -> 9937.32s]  Teller's magic show. If you watch Penn and Teller's show and see some of Penn and Teller's
[9937.32s -> 9942.52s]  greatest routines and you yawn during that viewing, I'm never calling you again. You're
[9942.52s -> 9958.14s]  getting ghosted for the rest of the time that I know you. One of the greatest routines that you'll
[9958.14s -> 9965.98s]  see. What an absolute joy of showmanship. I don't want to ruin it for you. Maybe I will.
[9966.62s -> 9971.50s]  No, no, no. Why would I do that? No, it's cool. If you haven't seen Penn and Teller's greatest
[9971.50s -> 9978.86s]  routine in my opinion, then mute the stream for the next five minutes. It's one where I
[9978.86s -> 9989.19s]  can't even tell you. Here's spoilers for Penn and Teller's magic act from like 1986 or something.
[9989.99s -> 9994.14s]  I believe it was on SNL. It was on an old episode of SNL.
[9996.14s -> 10001.35s]  Are you ready? Here we go. If you don't want to hear about Penn and Teller's greatest act
[10001.35s -> 10007.43s]  then mute right now. Here we go. Penn and Teller did this thing where the camera was just on them
[10007.43s -> 10011.08s]  and they're just kind of standing there. They're doing all these weird things that
[10011.08s -> 10016.28s]  seem impossible. They're like letting go of shit. They're like having stuff float in front of them
[10016.28s -> 10024.92s]  and fly up or fly down. Gravity makes no sense. They start holding shit like a light bulb in the
[10024.92s -> 10029.08s]  air and it just is in the air with them. It's just floating on its own. It's like how the
[10029.08s -> 10034.78s]  fuck is that even possible? Eventually the camera pulls back and what you realize is...
[10035.58s -> 10043.46s]  This is for like five to ten straight minutes. They just play with all these toys and nothing
[10043.46s -> 10048.74s]  makes any sense. The camera pulls back and they are fucking hanging upside down with a
[10048.74s -> 10054.89s]  fake set that spun the other way to make it look like they were standing up upright the whole time.
[10054.89s -> 10059.13s]  And they were upside down for like five to ten straight fucking minutes hanging upside down
[10059.13s -> 10074.87s]  and they did it live. It was crazy. Go look it up. You're free to go leave the stream for five
[10074.87s -> 10085.24s]  minutes and go watch Penn and Teller SNL upside down bit because you could almost... It's hard
[10085.24s -> 10090.71s]  to tell because they think they put a bunch of makeup on so their faces wouldn't be bright red
[10090.71s -> 10094.89s]  from all the blood rushing to their heads and you can kind of tell a couple of times after you
[10094.89s -> 10099.38s]  watch it a second time where it's like oh my god like he's talking and he's kind of struggling
[10099.38s -> 10104.65s]  a little bit sometimes to talk but he did not miss a single beat. Penn Jillette did not miss
[10104.65s -> 10109.45s]  a single beat during that entire routine. It's absolute showmanship and absolute respect.
[10109.45s -> 10140.44s]  Okay Gramps we get it. No that's a great routine. Penn Jillette the best a man can get. Yeah okay
[10140.44s -> 10158.62s]  yeah you guys can unmute. Scream upside down. I love that show. They had a show called Bullshit
[10159.34s -> 10184.87s]  Yeah they did. I think Penn still does like he besides the magic I think he still does like a
[10184.87s -> 10213.83s]  podcast or something right? Stop hitting things. And then Teller are based called Penn's Sunday
[10213.83s -> 10219.96s]  School. Oh my god I'm gonna run out of fucking time. Back up back up back up. Okay I got it.
[10223.74s -> 10238.84s]  They are not based. No I didn't get... Did I get money for that? Okay not very much but I got it.
[10238.84s -> 10255.27s]  All right that's the long-running side of things all right. Speaking of magicians if you guys you
[10255.75s -> 10263.54s]  I remember watching this guy his name is James Randy. Amazing Randy his name. He did this like
[10263.54s -> 10267.22s]  he did this talk at some either school or convention or something where he's up like
[10267.22s -> 10273.77s]  talking at the microphone and he's coming through the speakers to the auditorium and he's like he's
[10273.77s -> 10276.97s]  talking about like you know let me tell you something. If you guys you guys want to tell
[10276.97s -> 10281.16s]  me that you don't assume things and he's like oh yeah I don't assume anything. He's like you
[10281.16s -> 10286.57s]  already have assumed something. People are like yeah I usually I base my life on facts only.
[10287.29s -> 10291.83s]  He's like oh yeah this is not even a real microphone. He's been literally talking at
[10291.83s -> 10297.27s]  a microphone the whole time like on stage and he's like you assume that this is a working
[10297.27s -> 10300.47s]  microphone and he literally just like puts it down and he's just still talking and still
[10300.47s -> 10306.94s]  coming through the speakers. He had like a lapel mic on and he was wearing frames. He had like
[10306.94s -> 10311.54s]  glasses on but he was literally just wearing frames. He's like you assume that I need glasses.
[10312.10s -> 10316.20s]  I don't have these on and he just pulls them off and everyone like gasps in the audience
[10316.92s -> 10321.70s]  and then the person that's like sitting there going like I don't assume anything is just like
[10322.84s -> 10333.05s]  oh she got me. The Amazing Randy got me. Where am I going? The dick. No it was cool.
[10339.32s -> 10345.42s]  Where is there a job that I haven't done? I don't there's no more out of those missions here. Let's
[10345.42s -> 10359.29s]  go somewhere else. Oh there's lawn mowing missions here. Adventure? What is adventure?
[10359.29s -> 10372.86s]  Okay what about over here? Yeah let's do this one. This is in where is this? Where is this?
[10372.86s -> 10381.82s]  Obidden area. What's the countdown? What's the countdown? Oh that's not a countdown. Okay Neo
[10381.82s -> 10401.13s]  Brazil. Randy is great guys. Yeah the Amazing Randy has an awesome series. Remember you guys
[10401.13s -> 10407.91s]  remember Peter Popoff? Some of the voices you hear on this stream are based on Peter on Peter
[10407.91s -> 10412.17s]  Popoff talking. Oh let me get the devil. Why don't you just want to make the devil mad?
[10412.17s -> 10416.78s]  Like that's that's a guy that was like a televangelist and the Amazing Randy set up like a
[10417.58s -> 10424.52s]  audio sniffer in the guy's auditorium when he was like healing people and they heard the guy's wife
[10424.52s -> 10429.50s]  coming through and like telling people to point people out in the audience and be like oh this
[10429.50s -> 10433.82s]  person has arthritis in their knee. Tell them that they're talking about their arthritis
[10433.82s -> 10437.26s]  and he just he walks around he's like oh god is telling me over here somebody
[10438.14s -> 10445.72s]  somebody has some arthritis and they zoom in on the person's face it's like oh Mary Mary is
[10445.72s -> 10452.20s]  your name Mary god's telling me Mary with arthritis and she like stands up it's wicked
[10452.20s -> 10463.06s]  fucked up it's wicked fucked up the lady actually says into the microphone like into his earpiece
[10463.96s -> 10470.18s]  it's really like scary she's just like hello Peter I hope you can hear me if not we're in
[10470.18s -> 10480.94s]  trouble like we can't like manipulate an entire audience of people it's so fucked up yeah that
[10480.94s -> 10498.63s]  was James Randy he exposed that yeah the audience like filled out a survey card like I think it was
[10498.63s -> 10501.51s]  supposed to be like a personal card or something like a party that like it was supposed to be
[10501.51s -> 10508.66s]  given to anybody and then it was handed to the the wife who then in turn like fed it through his ear
[10509.38s -> 10513.05s]  because they like collected personal information about people beforehand or something
[10513.77s -> 10525.78s]  oh my god um this is what happens if you don't look by the way this is also back like 20 years
[10525.78s -> 10531.86s]  ago so I don't know obviously all I remember from Peter Popoff is he came back at one point
[10531.86s -> 10536.34s]  after this he got like exposed and then came back and started doing the miracle spring water
[10537.54s -> 10544.18s]  he would send you a little tiny vial of water that you were supposed to like drink and like
[10544.18s -> 10547.86s]  you might get a call from god and it would put money in your bank account
[10548.58s -> 10553.06s]  I wish I was making this up I this was an infomercial I used to watch this infomercial
[10553.06s -> 10558.17s]  and like like laugh at it because it was so absurd it was like all you have to do is just call and
[10558.17s -> 10573.54s]  get your free miracle spring water that is still on yeah and then they would like I don't remember
[10573.54s -> 10579.94s]  like the exact nature of the shit that they were doing or pulling or whatever they had these people

[11136.95s -> 11140.39s]  be able to have complete examination skills to see that there's no bugs in my food or my drink

[11201.64s -> 11207.00s]  in it there's bees in it there's wasps in it this is the part where I say I don't care because I
[11207.00s -> 11213.13s]  know that there's bugs in it I know that there are bugs in my food when I eat things I don't
[11213.13s -> 11217.53s]  expect there to be bugs in my food when I drink orange juice so if there are bugs in my orange
[11217.53s -> 11224.14s]  juice it's a huge problem and I'm dead because of because of you I want that person timed up
[11224.14s -> 11257.86s]  for at least 13 14 seconds oh never mind that person can stay so you'll eat a fistful of worms
[11257.86s -> 11264.47s]  because you know you're going to eat them um if my plan was to eat worms that day then I would eat
[11264.47s -> 11269.16s]  the worms because I was gonna okay look here's a handful of worms eat them if I make a like a
[11269.16s -> 11275.16s]  tuna casserole I don't want it to want to be worms in the tuna casserole because I'm not expecting
[11275.16s -> 11281.27s]  that and I don't want that if I wanted to eat bugs I would eat a bug this concept apparently
[11281.27s -> 11319.16s]  is incredibly difficult to understand you sure defeat a total oh I got a burger burger I need

[11913.48s -> 11920.78s]  okay um you guys know the rule in the channel so far at this point i think if i talk about that
[11920.78s -> 11926.30s]  i'm gonna do something and it does not happen within two to three weeks or let's say two weeks
[11926.94s -> 11940.78s]  and me bringing it up it's never going to happen there's a fine amount of time before you're never
[11940.78s -> 11945.29s]  going to see the thing i say you're going to see and that's probably at the very maximum probably
[11945.29s -> 11963.75s]  30 days all right i got it naked gun 55 and a fifth now that series is unbelievably funny if
[11963.75s -> 11969.54s]  you haven't seen the naked gun series go watch it now female convict scorpion jailhouse 51
[11971.91s -> 11980.17s]  off below 51 baseball no here's the thing all right here i'm gonna baseball was supposed to
[11980.17s -> 11986.79s]  happen last year but cove had messed it up so that's not my fault we're ready to go and then
[11986.79s -> 11992.57s]  this year the dollhouse took a lot more time and work to actually get that to happen so that took
[11992.57s -> 12000.18s]  over the summer and then baseball season is really only playable for like the next two or three weeks
[12000.26s -> 12009.85s]  before a lot of these places shut down the year baseball is guaranteed to happen most of it is
[12009.85s -> 12015.13s]  already paid for most of it's already ready to go we just need to have the right season and right
[12015.13s -> 12025.62s]  time frame that is going to be one of my favorite streams i've ever done it just will i know it will
[12025.62s -> 12033.77s]  but it might need to wait until like early spring of 2022 and make no mistake about this we have
[12033.77s -> 12040.65s]  already started working on the next like two or three large major projects with the channel those
[12040.65s -> 12047.53s]  are not going to reduce in frequency so don't worry working on it let's see the end of this game
[12056.86s -> 12057.90s]  60 000
[12065.98s -> 12073.62s]  time for the ranking battle head to daemon tower i'm not going to do that yet i'm going to go to

[12084.86s -> 12098.23s]  the chips one more time too are there going to be any more big streams for 2021 uh maybe if everything
[12098.23s -> 12104.26s]  can be said and done i'd like to have a holiday like christmas special well that's kind of what's
[12104.26s -> 12113.19s]  currently in the process right now so yes i would like to i turn this i have another scorpion right

[12205.56s -> 12213.61s]  was going to do just kind of give match it and give the rest of charity so the idea is i don't
[12213.61s -> 12217.37s]  want to give you an exact number because i don't know i forget what the exact number was but it
[12217.37s -> 12224.15s]  was more than i think 7500 total or like more than 5000 well maybe even more than 10 000 if

[12230.84s -> 12236.28s]  half or a little bit more to uh i don't know if you guys remember that um that science center in
[12236.28s -> 12243.82s]  nevada the people that helped us do the geology stream so we're gonna i'm gonna give it a
[12243.82s -> 12250.87s]  significant portion to them and then probably another bit to um uh one of the humane societies
[12250.87s -> 12257.77s]  out here there's a couple in nevada so that's the plan that's gonna probably happen in the next
[12257.77s -> 12276.33s]  within the next week or two probably that's the plan for that money because i wanted to make sure
[12276.33s -> 12279.77s]  i was going somewhere where i wanted it to go i didn't want to i didn't want to just pick like
[12279.77s -> 12289.67s]  a random spot for it to go because i mean i could have and that money did just come in um this
[12289.67s -> 12300.71s]  previous month's payment period from twitch so uh i wanted to really get on that oh right i'm
[12300.71s -> 12319.96s]  going downstairs you still think warrior where's gonna happen oh absolutely yeah it's probably
[12319.96s -> 12324.38s]  only like another 20 to 30 minutes of this game which would take us to somewhere around four
[12324.38s -> 12331.61s]  hours and i'll play warrior where for maybe like another hour or so hour or two i just want to
[12331.61s -> 12335.37s]  make sure i tell people that i didn't just forget about that that like oh whoops i didn't do it
[12336.25s -> 12341.94s]  oh no it's gonna happen all right so this is my probably my last upgrade what should i do what
[12341.94s -> 12352.86s]  do we got that's kind of that's really cool but i'd rather just go straight up just massive damage
[12352.86s -> 12362.06s]  i think let's just kill the last boss very easily with a maximum damage output
[12363.18s -> 12376.17s]  yeah actually can i afford it no i think that's the last thing i can afford i'll put it towards
[12376.17s -> 12393.05s]  this level 10 attack do i have enough money to buy the good sushi the dining one i do all right
[12393.05s -> 12401.00s]  well let's refill all this there's five heels and then i'm gonna buy the really supercharged dining
[12401.72s -> 12416.04s]  go check this out great what we got how do i still not have this cannot create because i
[12416.04s -> 12421.42s]  haven't discovered the other power thing oh wait a minute wrestling attack power plus 20
[12421.42s -> 12437.99s]  percent not bad okay these are new at least this one is oh shit normal attack plus 15 percent but
[12437.99s -> 12454.70s]  heavy attack is not even worth doing death kick guys wait i know i don't have enough
[12454.70s -> 12475.27s]  i can do one of these i like the heavy attack though death rain is better 20 i don't like
[12475.27s -> 12485.02s]  being that low i think i already have one of these after getting back up so when you get knocked down
[12485.02s -> 12497.53s]  that's actually insane during slow down after a perfect dodge wrestling attack power is up by
[12497.53s -> 12512.52s]  20 percent these are the defensive ones i almost feel like it's just make the normal attack power
[12512.52s -> 12534.57s]  really good these are all defensive i already have two of these on right now 50 faster charging
[12535.29s -> 12544.94s]  all right what about this one no yeah i think i'm gonna go for it i'm gonna do uh where is it
[12557.85s -> 12573.51s]  i like that too oh yeah i'm gonna do more damage death kick no there dyna chip there it is
[12574.47s -> 12579.35s]  normal attack power plus 15 yeah i want to just gotta remember that i'm doing it
[12581.90s -> 12594.28s]  i'm putting the attack power ones back on yeah all right let me see what i got because right
[12594.28s -> 12603.86s]  now i have the the slow after a perfect dodge is way longer weapon attack power plus 10 yeah let's
[12603.86s -> 12618.17s]  put this one on so this is 10 more damage now it's at 25 more damage what's this chip what's
[12618.17s -> 12632.58s]  this one do no no no no uh trigger chip all right i want the normal attack power one yeah all right
[12632.58s -> 12640.52s]  now i've got 10 20 i have 45 percent more damage with a normal attack i'm just gonna shred anybody
[12640.52s -> 12661.38s]  that i even see it looks good to me let's go check on um on shinobu she's not here why is
[12661.38s -> 12680.50s]  she not here it's 35 percent that's not weapon attack power 10 normal attack power 15 10
[12683.03s -> 12703.78s]  fuck it is 35 shit i thought it was 25 all right let's see the end of no more heroes 3 it's time
[12703.78s -> 12743.85s]  are you ready are you ready so we need to go to daemon's place uh daemon tower is here wait how
[12743.85s -> 12772.95s]  do i get there how do i get to daemon tower right on the highway oh daemon tower okay all right
[12772.95s -> 12792.12s]  cutscene incoming climax of the whole game see what happens transform or maybe not oh shit
[12798.92s -> 12812.82s]  all the henchmen strawberry right off let's move now this reminds me of the first game
[12813.78s -> 12816.58s]  it's like the line of enemies that you just do do do do
[12817.46s -> 12830.63s]  oh you're still alive bit rate bit rate bit rate
[12840.79s -> 12855.14s]  am i dead wait what did i die what happened oh i thought i got killed i'm gonna kick you in the
[12855.14s -> 12859.86s]  nut yeah i forgot about that i'm gonna kick you with a dust
[12882.06s -> 12884.94s]  it was always really funny when those clips played back to back to back to back
[12885.90s -> 12890.94s]  just a random number generator on what audio file to load i'll kick you in the nut i'll kick
[12890.94s -> 12905.94s]  you in the nuts i'm gonna kick you in the nuts okay all right dude do i have enough money to buy
[12905.94s -> 12923.30s]  one of the good uh sushis have i do have enough i can buy this one increased greatly increased
[12923.30s -> 12933.93s]  health attack power intention for the next fight yes i have a feeling on the really hard difficulty
[12933.93s -> 12974.87s]  modes these you have to probably eat these before every fight all right let's go and daemon i love
[12974.87s -> 12991.43s]  you so you actually made it all the way here more pleased than surprised to think that there was a
[12991.43s -> 12998.23s]  shining pebble in the rough of that trash planet after all you're that shining pebble
[12998.23s -> 13009.22s]  fucking diamond and that's quite a huge disparity you just can't stop talking can you prince dumb
[13009.86s -> 13018.66s]  do you really fear me that much what the fuck you say fear what the hell is fear anyway
[13018.66s -> 13025.38s]  i can't even comprehend the emotion you call fear no seriously tell me what is fear
[13026.18s -> 13032.26s]  that's sad didn't your mommy and daddy teach you it's not nice to cause trouble for others no
[13033.22s -> 13038.66s]  cause trouble and you'll get scolded but nobody's ever scolded you before have they
[13039.54s -> 13048.58s]  my daddy scolded me once i was punished and was sent to rodent space prison black hole prison it's
[13048.58s -> 13054.90s]  basically paradise that wasn't punishment you just went on a nice little vacation abroad
[13055.78s -> 13063.06s]  and that's how we get prince dumbasses like you yeah just keep talking keep fucking talking
[13063.62s -> 13068.02s]  go on get angry you fucking loser get all nice and salty for me
[13073.54s -> 13078.98s]  there we go those eyes right there the dumbass is turning into a beast
[13078.98s -> 13090.23s]  oh kill you kill you i'll kill you oh nice scary eyes that's what i want to see
[13090.87s -> 13091.99s]  oh that's the thumbnail
[13091.99s -> 13100.34s]  kill me demons don't got shit on me kill you you're getting real fucking crazy now
[13100.90s -> 13103.22s]  that's what i'm talking about
[13107.78s -> 13117.38s]  oh god we're just going oh my god okay i got so much power look at this damage
[13118.18s -> 13120.66s]  i can't hear him holy shit he has a he's a bubble up
[13131.05s -> 13150.15s]  i can't hurt him this dude had a bubble up oh looking good oh shit that's bad
[13150.95s -> 13158.90s]  no it's not i have so much more health than him hey he's got the shield back
[13160.09s -> 13177.67s]  anti-gravity don't do heavy attacks that's my mistake i shouldn't be doing it
[13184.90s -> 13187.62s]  i can't dodge i can't even move i can't do anything
[13197.02s -> 13203.54s]  god damn it oh the slow time thing doesn't work on him i get it you can't use it on
[13205.14s -> 13206.18s]  yeah you can't use it on
[13209.13s -> 13218.78s]  anti-gravity yeah you get he doesn't when time is slowed you can't hurt him
[13219.58s -> 13237.11s]  almost at phase two let's see phase two oh yeah can you even turn around
[13240.41s -> 13270.81s]  oh fuck what's this oh my goodness what do i do run away oh fuck what's that do all right
[13270.81s -> 13298.92s]  i'm hitting him with my auto attack thing it's funny why can i hit him come on say something
[13298.92s -> 13309.50s]  funny how do i get him to drop his guard you have to i think it's a perfect i think i have
[13309.50s -> 13329.05s]  to perfect dodge him this is bad i think that's what you do i gotta ask you have to get a perfect
[13329.05s -> 13346.84s]  dodge eyes yeah but how do i close his eyes like hide
[13350.31s -> 13357.16s]  disintegrate oh i got him to close his eyes the last time i perfect dodged him twice his eyes
[13366.34s -> 13367.14s]  fuck i didn't do it
[13378.55s -> 13385.51s]  yeah i don't understand i can let me get a perfect dodge if i can just at least get one perfect dog
[13386.63s -> 13391.59s]  i'll be able to wait they were close okay his eyes were closed maybe in the middle of when he
[13391.59s -> 13403.18s]  does that combo he doesn't go there it was yeah all right so you can only hit him okay
[13403.18s -> 13424.84s]  his eyes are still open can't hurt him that was a good trade okay that was a good reason
[13426.68s -> 13428.36s]  phase three incoming i have no health
[13432.49s -> 13450.60s]  what oh all right he's in phase three i gotta be careful this on hard would probably be so bad
[13451.56s -> 13453.46s]  whoa
[13473.70s -> 13486.97s]  oh i can't reach up there really close those all right that should be it probably gonna be
[13486.97s -> 13500.34s]  like another complete phase here we're definitely going into space that's definitely part one
[13500.34s -> 13528.01s]  oh god what shit i have no heels what do i even swing at
[13530.65s -> 13538.41s]  oh he's got his hands come out i don't know and i hurt his hand
[13541.35s -> 13542.55s]  oh fuck this camera
[13548.78s -> 13563.21s]  okay you can hurt the hand not drop this punch me punch me punch me oh my god punch me
[13563.77s -> 13575.99s]  you
[13603.40s -> 13604.60s]  all right this is not bad
[13619.40s -> 13628.31s]  okay where is he oh fuck he hit me right with his nails
[13628.31s -> 13635.08s]  shit oh no i gotta catch him in the slow motion ready watch this and
[13638.60s -> 13643.05s]  what come on
[13654.58s -> 13665.02s]  all right well slow and steady he's almost done i don't have to hit him in the hand i can hit him
[13665.02s -> 13684.76s]  without a forearm now that's that's good to know all right one more of those i'm out of health by
[13684.76s -> 13717.72s]  the way and now what oh here come my friends all right phase two what does he do okay just the same
[13717.72s -> 13720.20s]  thing all right same thing
[13735.19s -> 13739.59s]  nobody said what a boss well hold on a second i'm just literally phase two
[13741.50s -> 13750.62s]  i'm gonna go through all this and get one shot if i like the last phase it's gonna be so
[13750.62s -> 13764.63s]  disappointing because i have no health rechat please what no i can't like rechat right now
[13764.63s -> 13767.83s]  what's up
[13774.81s -> 13799.98s]  when you see spark dodge it'll make it go faster i just walked no now it's just more annoying
[13800.94s -> 13802.30s]  shit this is gonna be annoying
[13805.18s -> 13831.69s]  oh should i kick it oh no i'm gonna die i'm gonna die the last phase i already know it
[13832.89s -> 13847.99s]  i don't even fight just dodge there's no reason to even fight this
[13848.95s -> 13855.40s]  don't get hit just go away in a second after one more rotation all right there we go
[13874.50s -> 13897.54s]  do these lasers stay for the last phase this phase sucks where's the hand
[13902.02s -> 13911.26s]  this imagine having to do this on hard it would take so much longer i know that i could probably
[13911.26s -> 13913.22s]  oh what happened
[13924.09s -> 13940.78s]  he finally did it go champ how come no super huge end of the world end of the game villain
[13940.78s -> 13946.86s]  gets to this point and then decides to just leave you know what i mean like if you're at phase four
[13946.86s -> 13951.58s]  and you're still getting hit and you're like about to die and stuff just like okay stop talking
[13952.54s -> 13953.18s]  almost speaking
[13975.98s -> 14020.58s]  i'm good oh look out yeah that was pretty challenging that was hard imagine doing this
[14021.62s -> 14036.70s]  yeah i oh yeah i did it's definitely another one he's wide open now's your chance here we go
[14037.66s -> 14065.77s]  oh we're gonna have to go i get him oh dead by clothesline i don't buy it i don't buy it yet
[14074.33s -> 14086.04s]  end it with a brain buster
[14086.04s -> 14100.20s]  leaving
[14101.16s -> 14112.23s]  i love you damon i love you damon love you damon i loved you too fu
[14115.75s -> 14118.39s]  goodbye fu now fuck off

[14141.83s -> 14148.47s]  nice work travis so this is what it was all about looks like my hunch was right
[14149.19s -> 14156.63s]  you you're a friend of his right his friend are you kidding me that crazy alien bastard was just a
[14156.63s -> 14165.35s]  pawn i'm the real king i see so the real scumbag is you then i totally missed that it's all you
[14165.35s -> 14173.03s]  travis you you you hit me didn't you you hit me not even my dad has ever hit me

[14182.63s -> 14185.27s]  travis thunder break
[14193.37s -> 14203.50s]  dsa lore all right we hit him we punched him in the face and and travis strikes again and
[14203.50s -> 14210.22s]  it came back and it got super alien mutant powers now we're gonna get a go-go power rangers sequence
[14210.22s -> 14217.58s]  nobody told me about this what the fuck is happening hey that glastonbury thing call it
[14217.58s -> 14223.34s]  that's been decommissioned too much dark matter and deteriorated okay then what the hell do we
[14223.34s -> 14230.86s]  do now juvenile please do something about this i cannot do anything right away if i had around
[14230.86s -> 14238.54s]  two years i could help that's not gonna work no more heroes move it the dead cage is going off
[14238.54s -> 14245.26s]  it is transferring something over from another dimension transferring transferring what some
[14245.26s -> 14253.50s]  sort of unknown huge object starting countdown it's not a monster or something is it we get one more
[14253.50s -> 14260.54s]  monster or demon or whatever and this town is screwed yeah more like this planet three two
[14261.34s -> 14270.33s]  one here it comes any second the transfer is complete an arsenal roll-off model has arrived
[14270.33s -> 14276.89s]  what is this the mech from damon x machina from the japanese publisher marvelous an arsenal
[14277.69s -> 14282.17s]  and is the roll-out model the model with the same coloring system as the glastonbury
[14282.25s -> 14289.37s]  trevis hurry up use it i got no idea what the hell i'm doing but here is a crossover
[14291.21s -> 14297.61s]  oh god i'm in the cockpit unlock all weapons and fight here we go gene here we go was this
[14297.61s -> 14338.46s]  whole game a shitpost probably yeah it was the entire game what this thing is huge it's the credits
[14341.29s -> 14371.21s]  oh it is the credits it's the credit sequence okay quick time event credits what if i fail what
[14371.21s -> 14408.60s]  happens what i stabbed him in the chest oh i okay that was interesting where the hell are we
[14410.20s -> 14417.08s]  the edge of space maybe even the promised land nice place for a final showdown
[14418.14s -> 14428.95s]  we've come so far the train keeps going on and on forever it's over travis looks like this is the
[14428.95s -> 14436.87s]  final stop we'll settle this with sumo sumo like japanese sumo wrestling yeah real men settle
[14436.87s -> 14451.74s]  shit with sumo my god fine now for the final transformation start the game the final game
[14458.71s -> 14466.63s]  it's a smash brothers reference are you fucking kidding me are you serious he didn't get into
[14467.11s -> 14469.99s]  brother so they made their own end of oh my god
[14473.40s -> 14485.83s]  hold on do i have my all my moves still knock him off the stage let's go
[14486.97s -> 14495.90s]  oh you should be full armor mode let's go do i have it and she where is he
[14498.34s -> 14510.39s]  oh that did a shitload final smash that good ravis confirms the smash
[14511.03s -> 14521.42s]  i'm taking this game is fucked this game is just like i don't even how do i even how do you even
[14521.42s -> 14529.22s]  give this game a rating i don't want to die i don't want to die i don't want to die
[14529.94s -> 14540.02s]  i don't want to die i don't want to die i've still got somewhere to go home to but you you don't
[14542.07s -> 14556.92s]  i don't want to be sure to apologize to juvenile and have fun hanging out with prince dickhead in
[14556.92s -> 14574.10s]  hell i'll be honest they're not making another one of these i don't know how how why how would
[14574.10s -> 14582.73s]  you make another one this is the shotgun blast of all video game genres and all no more heroes
[14583.61s -> 14588.41s]  how do you even do another one of these so to said this was the last one
[14592.73s -> 14619.10s]  i mean this you can't have another one yeah that was um that was hilarious you end the game on a
[14619.10s -> 14633.67s]  smash brother's joke even the final boss fight was a joke yeah this is way different than the
[14633.67s -> 14639.64s]  other games the other games were jokes in quotes and jokey and weird but like somebody said this
[14639.64s -> 14647.30s]  entire game is a shitpost like i just like blinked and i was in my bed reading like our shitposts
[14647.30s -> 14663.37s]  like whatever the top post was and it's definitely after credit scene i'm not going anywhere
[14678.60s -> 14683.40s]  it's kind of sad in a way because i don't know i like i like this character and i like this
[14683.40s -> 14690.34s]  universe it's funny interesting it's it's i mean the gameplay might be pretty similar to a lot
[14690.34s -> 14694.10s]  of stuff that you know a third person sword fighting action game where you dodge you dodge
[14694.10s -> 14705.14s]  enemies i love this like concept it's really cool i hope this is really not the end of travis
[14705.14s -> 14709.38s]  touchdown i would i would play another one of these you know it doesn't have to be immediate
[14709.38s -> 14713.54s]  right even if it was just like an action game and you just did like another one of the i don't know
[14713.54s -> 14734.36s]  it's sad to see it go but it was it was great all right nice place for the home run king huh
[14734.36s -> 14746.46s]  working old buddy fucking dying on me like that i was never able to say this but you always looked
[14746.46s -> 14753.91s]  so cool hitting home runs you always bought me marble fudge ice cream after your games i actually
[14753.91s -> 14759.91s]  wanted coffee flavor but you always assumed that a little kid would want marble so i never said
[14759.91s -> 14799.26s]  anything tsa skipper feels nothing here i own no more hero i wonder if the game keeps going
[14799.26s -> 14822.95s]  because i got money at the end there another after after credit scene is completionist stuff
[14822.95s -> 14828.18s]  yeah i imagine that's t-shirt t-shirts and collectibles and other fights probably on muck
[14828.18s -> 14840.86s]  still gonna get to level 50 and warrior wear i'm gonna try maybe gotta warm up to it though
[14840.86s -> 14855.42s]  yeah it's been four hours i'm not done i planned on at least spending like an hour or two in
[14855.42s -> 14864.97s]  wario where let's see how it goes i don't have to go far it's just the menu and then second tile
[14864.97s -> 14871.24s]  but i am gonna go pee though we're gonna take one more break after the credits gonna see what
[14871.24s -> 14879.30s]  happens this game meet your expectations um i don't think it could met could have met any
[14879.30s -> 14886.06s]  expectations because the game was so outrageous and just unlike anything that i thought there
[14886.06s -> 14890.38s]  was ever gonna happen with the game that i don't like i said i can't get this game a rating
[14893.30s -> 14903.83s]  i would say it's definitely worth playing and it's definitely probably the most fun and interesting
[14903.83s -> 14910.95s]  in quotes of the three i think the first game is a better video game but i think this is a better
[14910.95s -> 14929.21s]  experience worth playing out of 10 yeah that means at least it sits somewhere in the seven to eight
[14929.21s -> 14952.33s]  seven to nine area it was great you said it was a 9.8 on the first stream no i said 9.4
[14953.05s -> 14962.95s]  i didn't say 9.8 this game feels more like a novelty yeah it was almost it was almost a big
[14962.95s -> 14975.24s]  toy that makes any sense it was a big watchable cartoon toy that i could watch and play which is
[14975.24s -> 14990.54s]  just a video game i just described what a video game was is okay that's stupid yeah it's this
[14990.54s -> 14996.86s]  digital uh digital toy where you see and watch what's happening on the screen and you control
[14996.86s -> 15017.96s]  stuff yeah like a big digital toy a video game it was basically the paw patrol movie give it a
[15017.96s -> 15045.02s]  number i can't i love this song though this song is like a nine out of ten um i don't know because
[15045.02s -> 15052.57s]  it it changed directions seven or eight different times each one of the boss fights was its own
[15054.39s -> 15060.55s]  encapsulated joke that was taken away from the rest of the game so i don't know it's hard to
[15060.55s -> 15084.22s]  even tell us tell you what this was all right let's see we get yeah the only thing i can tell
[15084.22s -> 15092.73s]  you is i really liked it it was very good i very much enjoyed the whole time here all right here

[15138.89s -> 15143.45s]  vast distances to come to this planet earthling to enter into a peace accord
[15145.78s -> 15152.90s]  representative earthlings do i fucking look like it on that case it would appear that peace
[15152.90s -> 15160.42s]  negotiations have failed what wait a second at first you gotta talk with some actual representatives
[15160.50s -> 15166.90s]  and then under baptist interplanetary law i hereby seize the planet earthling
[15168.39s -> 15196.71s]  do it uh damn who the hell are dad it's me have you forgotten what your own kids look like

[15261.59s -> 15265.75s]  that cosplaying dickhead killed you and is counting down to this planet's destruction
[15267.67s -> 15273.83s]  my great uncle teamed up with some super messed up aliens and was attempting to conquer the planet
[15273.83s -> 15279.75s]  so we have to change the future come with us come with us otherwise you're gonna die
