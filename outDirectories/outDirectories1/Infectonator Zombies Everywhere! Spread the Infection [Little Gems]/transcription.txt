[0.38s -> 18.96s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Infectinator, the reimagining and the remaking of an old Flash game by the same title.
[18.96s -> 29.46s]  This is actually, people like to say this is Infectinator 2. I don't really see it as that. I see this as, again, a reimagining of the original Flash game or of the World Domination title,
[29.46s -> 36.46s]  because that's essentially what you're going to be doing in this game. And this is one of my all-time favorite Flash games ever, and it's been ported to mobile devices.
[36.46s -> 43.46s]  So that's why I say reimagining, because it was never on mobile devices before until this point. So what is this game? What's going to happen here?
[43.46s -> 51.46s]  And this is, I guess, the revival of a series I used to do called Little Gems, and it's when I review a mobile game on Android, iPhone, iPad, anything like that.
[51.46s -> 55.46s]  So we're not going to waste any more time. I'm going to go right into this here, talk about Infectinator.
[55.46s -> 63.41s]  So at the heart of this game, it is a World Domination simulator, not like the ones you're used to. This is not, you know,
[63.41s -> 72.41s]  or take your army general and go from country to country. No, no, no. Instead of being an army general, you are a hive mind virus
[72.41s -> 78.41s]  that your entire goal is to spread around the entire world, destroying every single continent on Earth.
[78.41s -> 87.41s]  Now that might sound a little bit morbid, and it kind of is. This game is a little bit graphic in the sense that the whole point of the game is to destroy all of humanity
[87.41s -> 93.03s]  and not to rescue or save anything. So the gameplay mechanics are actually very, very simple.
[93.03s -> 102.03s]  It's all about clicking on people to infect them with a virus, and you want to try and spread the virus around until everybody on the screen is dead.
[102.03s -> 109.03s]  Again, we're going back to morbid thoughts here, but you use your hand. You tap your finger down on anywhere on the screen.
[109.03s -> 113.03s]  Anywhere in that area, people are going to turn into zombies. You're going to kill them. They'll turn into zombies.
[114.03s -> 120.03s]  Walk around for a certain period of time, depending on your upgrades. And we all know how much I am adoring of an upgrade system in a game.
[120.03s -> 126.03s]  There's a really, really good one in this one. But anyways, you click on the screen, you get people infected, and you try to complete objectives.
[126.03s -> 132.21s]  Each level in this game has four objectives. Completing all of them will destroy that city.
[132.21s -> 139.21s]  And again, the whole point of this game is to infect and destroy the entire world, so it's in your best interest to complete all four of those objectives.
[139.21s -> 144.21s]  They can be things from completing the level in a certain amount of time to summoning a certain zombie.
[144.21s -> 149.21s]  We'll get to that in a minute. Or anything as simple as blowing somebody up with a grenade or something.
[149.21s -> 152.21s]  There's objectives in each level, and they change for each level.
[152.21s -> 157.09s]  So now we get the basics down. Let's talk about the best part about this entire game.
[157.09s -> 162.09s]  And like I said, I'm an upgrade fiend. You guys all know that if you are old subscribers to this channel.
[162.09s -> 166.09s]  So how this one works, you get money, as you've probably seen on the screen.
[166.09s -> 169.09s]  Money drops out of people when they become infected and when they die.
[169.09s -> 173.09s]  And how you collect it, you just kind of scroll your mouse over the money and you'll pick it up.
[173.09s -> 181.33s]  What you do with that money is then you spend it on upgrades for your zombies or to buy and upgrade special zombies.
[181.33s -> 185.33s]  I actually think I just said mouse right there. We're talking about the mobile version of the game.
[185.33s -> 188.33s]  So your finger, you swipe your finger across the money to pick it up.
[188.33s -> 193.33s]  This game is for PC, it is for computer, but we're talking about the mobile version right now.
[193.33s -> 200.33s]  So anyways, how you spend this money after you collect it is you go to the lab, which is just a glorified huge upgrade screen.
[200.33s -> 205.33s]  And almost every single aspect of your zombies can be improved with that money.
[205.33s -> 213.33s]  So we're talking their attack damage, how fast they move, their lifespan, how much infection chance percentage they get when they bite somebody and kill somebody.
[213.33s -> 218.33s]  So there's a ton here, and it takes a lot of money to do a lot of these things.
[218.33s -> 224.33s]  Especially if you played through the whole game more than once, you're going to need to spend a lot of that money on these upgrades.
[224.33s -> 228.33s]  Because they incrementally, exponentially get higher after each upgrade.
[228.33s -> 231.33s]  So just keep that in mind while you're playing through the game.
[231.33s -> 235.76s]  And also one of the most important parts of this game are the special zombies that you get.
[235.76s -> 239.76s]  You unlock them by doing certain achievements or by completing certain continents.
[239.76s -> 244.76s]  There's a long list of them, and some of them you can't even get unless you beat the game once or twice.
[245.76s -> 249.76s]  So it takes a long time to do a completionist kind of aspect of this game.
[249.76s -> 252.76s]  But anyway, so you get these four slots.
[252.76s -> 259.76s]  There's also four slots for support, too, where your grenades are, your green goo that infects people and lets them stay in one place.
[259.76s -> 261.76s]  And they all can be upgraded.
[261.76s -> 269.76s]  Well, the support can't be upgraded, but all these special zombies that have their own traits and their own damage numbers, they can all be upgraded three times.
[269.76s -> 273.76s]  And I don't think I've even said this yet, and the video is probably going to be wrapping up here.
[273.76s -> 277.76s]  This game's free. It is completely free on every single device.
[277.76s -> 279.76s]  And again, it's free on PC as well.
[279.76s -> 283.76s]  The only thing that they charge for, there are in-app purchases for the gold.
[283.76s -> 289.76s]  So if you are, you know, you don't want to spend like five million years grinding gold to try and get to the next level or something,
[289.76s -> 292.76s]  you can buy a package of gold for a certain amount of money.
[292.76s -> 294.76s]  But the whole experience is completely free.
[294.76s -> 300.19s]  You don't have to spend one cent on anything to download it and play it and get the most out of it.
[300.19s -> 307.19s]  And just for a point of reference here, I've beaten this game multiple times and I didn't need to spend one dollar in the in-app purchase store.
[307.19s -> 311.19s]  So it's not one of those games where you're required to buy the gold.
[311.19s -> 312.19s]  You don't have to do that.
[312.19s -> 314.82s]  But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[314.82s -> 316.82s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[316.82s -> 319.82s]  Go get Infectinator right now. It is awesome.
[319.82s -> 325.82s]  I highly recommend it. All the links are in the description for your various devices or if you want to play it on PC.
[325.82s -> 327.82s]  So thank you guys again so much for watching.
[327.82s -> 328.82s]  I'll see you all next time.
[328.82s -> 330.82s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
