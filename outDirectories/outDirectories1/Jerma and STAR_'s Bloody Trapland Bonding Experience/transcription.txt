[0.31s -> 11.98s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with
[12.75s -> 14.11s]  Star!
[14.11s -> 19.95s]  And we're gonna be playing some Bloody Trapland. If you don't know what Bloody Trapland is, it's a bloody fucking good time, mate.
[20.15s -> 22.15s]  It's gonna be it's like Super Meat Boy.
[23.23s -> 30.52s]  Let's do the duck in every video. My name is Star. And Boo is in the call. Why are you Jerma too?
[30.52s -> 36.79s]  I want to be Jerma too. No, you're gonna confuse people. You need to change your name to Star Undercore.
[36.95s -> 41.91s]  You can't do that. It asks you to set your name when you start the game. You seriously picked Jerma too?
[42.13s -> 50.13s]  Yes. Are you a fucking idiot? Deeper into the cave we go. Do you just kill me?
[51.29s -> 57.12s]  How are you supposed to beat this part?
[58.72s -> 64.58s]  Oh my god. Oh, well you fuck up.
[70.18s -> 75.54s]  What? How did you even get by? Oh! Oh! How did you get by? Fuck, I just-
[75.90s -> 85.24s]  All right, I got this rat. We got this- something tells me this is really gonna suck.
[85.28s -> 92.16s]  This is level three. Fucking god damn it. No!
[92.80s -> 103.63s]  Calm down. Seriously calm down. Go one at a time. Okay. I'm bored. I just want to look at my cat's butt.
[103.63s -> 108.11s]  How come you're not facing the camera when you bend over? Oh, kitty cat. Yes.
[108.11s -> 115.74s]  I'm busy like winning the level motherfucker. See I like turn the- I turned to like say something to you and I like died.
[115.74s -> 122.13s]  Oh my god. I'm not even having fun. That's your own problem. I'm having the lots of fun.
[122.17s -> 128.53s]  I'm having tons of fun. You're gonna have to beat this stage then. I don't think I can do it.
[128.53s -> 134.24s]  You just don't feel like playing anymore. You just seriously gonna give up like that? Yeah.
[134.44s -> 138.18s]  I'm just gonna be here to annoy you and see if I can jump on your head or anything.
[141.98s -> 146.68s]  Wow, is this the boss fight? What's the first boss fight? I don't think there's any bosses.
[146.80s -> 160.84s]  There's no- if you- you really need to fuck off right now. Need a clip? Need a clip? Need a clip?
[161.44s -> 176.36s]  What? Oh, I thought we started on the left. What?
[177.88s -> 179.88s]  What just happened?
[180.36s -> 187.60s]  We got air shot. Why is there friendly fire like that? This makes it so much more difficult to do anything.
[187.80s -> 194.22s]  This game takes way too much concentration. I just want to play something nice like Rest In Peace Department.
[194.42s -> 197.14s]  Why won't you ever play Rest In Peace Department with me?
[197.78s -> 204.80s]  Funny thing is this video is gonna be going up before you put that one up so that joke will make sense.
[208.07s -> 219.25s]  Shit. Oh my god. No. No, I don't even know- I don't know what to do. I'm so- I don't know. I don't know. Fuck!
[222.05s -> 233.95s]  I don't see you getting that far. Look where I am. I'm up here. You go first because seriously, this is just getting stupid.
[242.58s -> 244.88s]  I'm trying to beat it.
[250.28s -> 252.52s]  You're an idiot, you know that.
[253.32s -> 259.91s]  Well, look at you. You did the same thing I did. Oh, good joke. Here, did you joke? Need a joke? Oh, shit.
[259.91s -> 261.91s]  I was gonna shit talk.
[264.44s -> 274.52s]  I'm kind of confused as to do right here. Well, how do you get over that? Oh, oh, okay. Do it. Do it up.
[274.64s -> 278.14s]  You can do this.
[279.58s -> 293.28s]  Nice. I wouldn't like this game if we weren't furries. How did you just seriously do-
[293.28s -> 295.28s]  You would kill me, asshole!
[300.58s -> 304.50s]  I'm sorry. You had a thing going there and I just fucked it all up.
[313.52s -> 316.00s]  I triggered it. Will you go? I triggered the fist. Go!
[316.48s -> 321.01s]  I just triggered the fist right there and you didn't even do- you didn't do anything.
[321.99s -> 326.64s]  You figure you're just gonna sit there and keep doing the crouch. Oh my goodness.
[329.06s -> 331.54s]  I'm making progress.
[331.54s -> 334.80s]  Oh, yeah? How do you like that?
[334.80s -> 336.63s]  Trigger the fist again.
[336.63s -> 339.99s]  No, you're not gonna do anything. If I trigger the fist again, you're not gonna do anything. You're just gonna stand there.
[340.95s -> 346.82s]  Yeah, I triggered it. Nice. Can we just sit back and let me do it? No.
[347.54s -> 351.62s]  Yes. Just sit back and just enjoy this. Enjoy this presentation of greatness.
[356.64s -> 360.56s]  Shit. That was- that was not planned. Good presentation.
[362.45s -> 369.41s]  Is this strike two? Strike two? Strike two? See that swirly thing? That never happened before. Strike three.
[369.57s -> 372.69s]  That never happened before. You're out. You're out. No. Here's the preview.
[372.93s -> 376.21s]  Can we edit around and just do it like I did at first try?
[377.19s -> 380.39s]  All right. Yeah. Can we just pretend like this is the first time I'm going in?
[380.47s -> 386.96s]  Yeah, let's pretend this is the first time you went in. Yeah, all this blood you see is like we just got to this stage.
[387.20s -> 389.20s]  Yeah, somebody- some like real- some scrub
[389.68s -> 393.84s]  was here before us and died like 300 times at this stage. It wasn't us.
[394.08s -> 406.10s]  Oh, there's even more to this bullshit. You better pull this through because there's no way I'm doing that. God damn, that thing is just
[407.48s -> 411.48s]  right in my ass. There's a pattern. There's a pattern. There's like an actual pattern to this.
[412.36s -> 414.92s]  I'm just trying to do it- I'm trying to do it ASAP Rocky.
[418.95s -> 425.75s]  Oh boy. No. What? I did like the lightest jump you could do there.
[434.20s -> 438.68s]  Whoa. Whoa, dude. Whoa. Okay. Whoa.
[453.19s -> 457.72s]  Yeah, how long do we have to play this so you can like have a video?
[459.04s -> 464.16s]  How long is this gonna keep going on? Like I don't think you've had any fun.
[466.24s -> 468.48s]  You do realize I'm putting that part in.
[469.64s -> 474.84s]  You do realize. Yeah, I know that's like how you conclude your video. Yeah. Oh.
[481.99s -> 483.99s]  What the hell is wrong with you?
