[0.63s -> 23.14s]  Hello. Good afternoon. How are you? Fresh water. Keep me going. We're going to continue playing
[23.14s -> 29.74s]  The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction. Don't know what The Incredible Hulk is or what ultimate
[29.74s -> 38.26s]  destruction means. Um, you're in for a big treat today. And let me tell you, there are like 300
[38.26s -> 45.82s]  other Marvel characters. If you think The Hulk is cool, just wait till you see fucking radiation,
[45.82s -> 55.24s]  man. I'm sure he exists in Marvel. Let's find out. Okay. Uh, radiation, man. Marvel. They have a
[55.24s -> 65.94s]  database with like fucking 5,000 superheroes. Yes. Radioactive man, I guess. Radioactive man.
[65.94s -> 81.21s]  He's there. Marvel is the Simpsons of superheroes. Wait, am I following that correctly? It's wait,
[81.21s -> 84.89s]  jokes to the Simpsons are like Marvel to superheroes is what you're saying.
[85.69s -> 100.39s]  Okay. I get, I get you now. I get you. Wrong order. Jokes on the Simpsons are to like
[100.39s -> 106.17s]  superheroes that exist in Marvel. Howard the Duck is the best character. I mean, if it was a frog,
[106.17s -> 112.06s]  I'd probably agree with you. Why is there no frog Marvel superhero? Is there? Is there like a,
[112.06s -> 119.45s]  is there a frog man? Let's see. Frog Marvel. Is there a frog in Marvel? Yep. There is. His name
[119.45s -> 128.89s]  is leapfrog leapfrog. Cool. I have, why do I not own every single comic of this?
[129.45s -> 141.98s]  That's unfortunate. Here's to a good stream. Yeah. We're going to play some more Hulk.
[142.70s -> 148.14s]  I feel like I'm going to beat the game. I think there's only like another four plus five hours
[148.14s -> 152.94s]  or so left in the game and I'm going to, I'm going to beat it. If I don't beat it. Well,
[152.94s -> 158.78s]  then I'm in deep shit because if I can't be Hulk, if I cannot beat Hulk ultimate destruction,
[159.34s -> 168.04s]  but I will beat Simpsons hit and run. It's a problem there. Anyways, let's go. Uh,
[168.04s -> 177.56s]  we're just going to pick up where we left off yesterday. Is exactly right here. I just remember
[177.56s -> 186.68s]  the controls. A is jump. Good. You have to eat a Funko pop if you can't beat the game.
[187.82s -> 200.44s]  I don't want to eat a Funko pop. All right, let's get going. Show us your room so we can make fun
[200.44s -> 210.15s]  of you. No, I learned my lesson as of yesterday. Okay. Lesson has been learned. I ain't ever shown
[210.15s -> 231.21s]  myself on camera ever again. Good. We're sorry. Okay. Somebody just hit me in the air, right?
[231.21s -> 243.59s]  That's not even possible. That's not even possible to hit me in the air. The threat has dropped.
[244.39s -> 248.70s]  What that means is I can't see him anymore. Therefore he doesn't exist.
[251.14s -> 253.46s]  Well, you know, when are they going to innovate on that? By the way,
[254.34s -> 264.07s]  I want some real AI innovation. GTA six. Check this out. Holy fucking holy shit. I just figured
[264.07s -> 270.10s]  out the greatest system ever. You guys know the nemesis system that everyone loved and was obsessed
[270.10s -> 281.29s]  with in a shadow of mortar. Imagine in GTA six, there's like detectives that like, like will track
[281.29s -> 284.97s]  you down and like they'll do their little intro. They'll come in and like detective car and they'll
[284.97s -> 291.59s]  be like asking you questions. That would be incredible. It wouldn't happen that frequently.
[291.59s -> 299.88s]  That would be awesome to have like a nemesis system, but it's detectives in GTA six.
[300.84s -> 313.22s]  Can I just break the bridge? Can I break the bridge? Where's the star on top? Is it on top of
[313.22s -> 319.22s]  the bridge? Nintendo should hire you. Well, Nintendo doesn't, it hasn't been a Nintendo
[319.22s -> 324.44s]  grant of photos since ever. Has it ever been? Okay. I can make this jump. I promise.
[332.78s -> 351.18s]  Just break it so I can get it. The camera. Sorry. Oh, nobody was in there. Okay.
[351.18s -> 361.98s]  Hey, hey, let me, excuse me. Was that a missile? Don't worry. There's always a guy with a missile
[361.98s -> 385.83s]  launcher. Where is he? Find a monk. Come here. I want you to watch me do this. You're going to
[385.83s -> 393.10s]  watch me complete this. It's Chad. No, no, put me down. You're going to sit here. You're going to
[393.10s -> 399.18s]  watch me get to the star. No, please. No, you're so bad. You can't do it. Please don't hurt me.
[400.14s -> 408.57s]  I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to hurt you. The sharks might.
[412.25s -> 416.09s]  Turns out he hit the edge of the bridge. Sorry. Wait, what are you guys doing?
[416.65s -> 426.38s]  Why? What are you people doing? Why are you jumping off the bridge? Hey, why are they?
[428.31s -> 452.20s]  I'm not doing this. Am I? I have nothing to do with this. I can't. Well, cut it out. Okay.
[452.20s -> 457.00s]  Let's do it. Our stolen mainframe interfaces directly into the division satellite tracking
[457.00s -> 464.04s]  system. Viewers dropping. Oh my God. Get the fuck out of here. Secured research facilities.
[464.04s -> 468.68s]  Get out of here. Profilers are as delicate as they are there. So you're going to have to bring
[468.68s -> 474.04s]  the whole truck back. Oh, that's secured by a mechanized escort team and some sort of energy
[474.04s -> 478.60s]  defense field. If I had more time, I could get some data on this, but you intercept the truck
[478.60s -> 485.88s]  and bring it back. That sounds easy enough. But anyways, detective and they'd be named
[485.88s -> 490.04s]  and each person in a different game could have their own detective. That was like coming after
[490.04s -> 495.32s]  them. Maybe you could even be a detective. No, that would never work. Maybe you could be a detective
[495.32s -> 501.08s]  in somebody else's game, but no, the first person that was able to invade your game like Dark Soul
[501.08s -> 505.66s]  style and be a detective would just fucking fly a helicopter to where you were and just launch
[505.66s -> 508.70s]  missiles at you while you ran around in a circle until you died. And then they would leave your
[508.70s -> 513.02s]  game. This would never work. And on paper, it's a great idea. In practice, it's horrible.
[521.51s -> 528.66s]  Intercept. I have to take the whole truck. Jeremy, you're cool. Hope you're doing well.
[528.66s -> 562.90s]  Hey, thanks. Did I make it? I did. Forward. Dash. I think I made okay time here. That was
[562.90s -> 577.70s]  a nice sponsored one guy. How do you sponsor one guy? I don't understand. But did you mean I'm
[577.70s -> 581.54s]  paying people to write nice things about me? Is that what you're saying? All right. I'm going to
[581.54s -> 591.19s]  take it slow. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me this shit. Shield. Okay.
[591.19s -> 598.90s]  Where's this helicopter? Oh, damn it. Oh shit. Oh, it looks like three detectives got in my game.
[601.22s -> 609.38s]  No. Okay. Yeah. Where's the nice investigation you got going here? Oh, there he is.
[610.34s -> 614.22s]  Oh, the three of you in a discord together. I think it's funny to like come in my game and do
[614.22s -> 623.98s]  this. How do I turn off online mode? Because that's what's going to happen. Anybody know?
[624.38s -> 629.10s]  I can't wait to read like the 50 fucking steam discussion threads about how to turn off online
[629.10s -> 645.86s]  mode. Thanks a lot, guys. I just got absolutely destroyed. That was insane. Okay. So lesson
[645.86s -> 655.53s]  learned. Got to destroy the helicopters first. If only you had a move that blocked missiles.
[655.53s -> 672.31s]  I know it's called play in offline mode. It's going to run down the road. Nice Funko pop loser.
[672.31s -> 678.71s]  Where were you yesterday? Are you watching the VOD and you think it's a live chat?
[684.66s -> 687.62s]  Wait, that doesn't make any sense. How would that be possible? All right. I'm going for it.
[687.62s -> 689.54s]  Here we go. There they are. All right. All right. All right. All right. Give me cars.
[690.34s -> 712.95s]  Where are they? They're up there. Get out of the fucking way. We go in three, two, three,
[713.59s -> 739.42s]  two, one. Launch homing car. Got it. Oh my God. Get over. It's still, that can't be still alive.
[739.42s -> 764.04s]  Right. Oh, fuck you. Health, right? No, I have to kill these things. Otherwise I'm in deep trouble.
[773.34s -> 795.48s]  Hi. Kick it. Backhand. Kick. Headbutt. Buy coffee. What? Did somebody just say buy coffee?
[796.28s -> 804.82s]  He's still talking about Funko pop. Am I ever going to get you guys to stop talking about Funko
[804.82s -> 811.93s]  pops? Am I going to, am I going to have to eat like, oh no, am I going to have to eat like a
[811.93s -> 818.30s]  live squid on stream for you guys to like, be like, holy shit. This is, I got to, this is boy. Okay.
[818.30s -> 835.66s]  Fuck the Funko pops ever. This dude's eating squid. Do I have to eat a cooked squid calamari
[835.66s -> 844.58s]  on stream for you guys to stop this? Here we go. All right. Yeah. I intercept it. Don't kill it.
[846.55s -> 849.83s]  I have to grab this and run away with it. But this tank over there has his items.
[851.61s -> 881.99s]  Great. Hank. Almost there. Oh fuck. It's almost there. It's almost there. Oh, I did too many
[881.99s -> 888.79s]  jumps. I did too many jumps. Don't let it die. Come here. Get it. He's on two wheels. He's showing
[888.79s -> 900.39s]  up. Wait, why is he electrified? What? I got to break it. Throw something at it. Who the fuck are
[900.39s -> 931.70s]  you? Okay. Get it. Is it electrified still? Wait, what the fuck? Locate division transport.
[931.70s -> 947.74s]  Retrieve division transport. Okay. I located it and I tried to retrieve it. What do you mean?
[947.74s -> 960.71s]  Read. Locate transport. Retrieve transport. It's, there it is. What else do I have to do besides
[964.30s -> 997.82s]  play city heroes? They don't even exist anymore. Why do I feel like I'm at like times five speed?
[1002.68s -> 1016.57s]  Help. No, don't throw the tank. What is? Okay. Like seriously. Honest to God.
[1017.45s -> 1027.70s]  Did you give me a break? Why are these tuned like this? And now I see. Yes, I just said tuned.
[1027.70s -> 1044.68s]  Okay. Why is this tuned like this? Fucking God. I'm about to die because the helicopters
[1044.68s -> 1051.88s]  fly around at 1200 miles per hour and they drive into the fucking ground and into buildings and
[1052.44s -> 1062.15s]  doesn't even matter. They just slam and skid all over everything. I was fucking tuned like that.
[1089.38s -> 1095.86s]  He's got a bus. Why do I have the bus in my hand? I mean, if you were in this bus, which okay,
[1095.86s -> 1100.74s]  if you could get across the whole city in fucking like two minutes instead of like 40.
[1101.78s -> 1107.46s]  Okay. Mission objective. Disable division transport vehicle by throwing things at it.
[1108.02s -> 1120.44s]  What am I doing that? I was throwing shit at it already. How many things? How many things
[1120.44s -> 1134.20s]  do I have to throw at it? Do I have to keep doing this until it's broken? Oh, I don't. Do I?
[1138.20s -> 1144.28s]  They're destroying the thing. I can't even, man. This is fucking ridiculous. This is made by the
[1144.28s -> 1172.98s]  Simpsons hit and run devs. No chance that it's not. No chance. It has to have been. Get. No,
[1172.98s -> 1175.78s]  don't jump in the water. How do I avoid the water? How do I avoid the water?
[1186.82s -> 1193.06s]  Mike, how far am I? Where's the nearest one? What? Fuck. I have to go around the whole thing.
[1195.05s -> 1207.94s]  That's not cool. Here comes a fall joke. No, I don't want to do this one again.
[1208.90s -> 1215.74s]  Can anyone count how many times? Okay. How many missions have I done so far?
[1216.62s -> 1221.69s]  I think I've done what? Like 10 missions. I think at every single mission at the end,
[1221.69s -> 1226.41s]  I've said, no, no, I don't want to do this one again. I ran by it. I ran by it. Fuck.
[1227.13s -> 1233.05s]  I'm literally not even paying attention to the game. I'm just speaking to you guys.
[1244.17s -> 1260.02s]  Jump out. But what I was saying was I don't think I've ended a mission and gone. Yes. Oh,
[1260.02s -> 1276.20s]  I wish I could do that one again. Shield grind. I'm going to get the shield grind.
[1276.84s -> 1294.18s]  I have 100,000 Hulk points. I was going to say green points. All right. Shield grind. Grind any
[1294.18s -> 1299.37s]  shield just like a board. I don't want. How's this going to even help me? What?
[1307.03s -> 1317.27s]  How's this going to help me? A club smasher, air sonic, missile punchback, reflect projectiles
[1317.27s -> 1334.28s]  with a well-timed punchback. I want to try this move out. Remember the shield grind is a full
[1334.28s -> 1347.59s]  letter grade. Oh, is that a car? That's actually all right. Cool. Try following the on-screen
[1347.59s -> 1352.63s]  instructions. We need to get a handle on these new powers. There are 30 missions. I'll see you
[1352.63s -> 1369.32s]  guys next week. I've already done like 15 of them. If you can target, see what if I just punch
[1369.32s -> 1385.85s]  wildly? Will it work? That is confirmed. I have it. You still get, okay, if they, if they fire
[1385.85s -> 1400.78s]  10 of them at you, you're going to get hit by nine. Well done. But also they die. That's true.
[1401.34s -> 1410.95s]  All right. Let's go. Oh, that is actually the same depth. I, yeah, I can tell.
[1411.83s -> 1438.74s]  Why do they call him the Hulk? It's the, what do you mean? You talk, well, you're talking about
[1438.74s -> 1448.87s]  like, why do, why do they call him the Hulk? Cause he's a big person, like huge hulking,
[1450.94s -> 1462.34s]  jacked, large, lots of mass. What do you, I don't know. I got to buy more shit.
[1462.98s -> 1477.53s]  Yeah. That's a mass. This is what it means. A critical thunder clap. No, no, no. It's too
[1477.53s -> 1488.73s]  expensive. I want like air critical atomic, air enemy grapple. Yes. Those guys are so spear impale
[1489.37s -> 1498.55s]  max charge a club throw and spear Hulk class opponents. Yeah. I don't feel like that sentence
[1498.55s -> 1506.63s]  I can't even comprehend this sentence. Max charge a club throw and spear Hulk class opponents
[1507.43s -> 1528.49s]  comprehending it. Max charge a club throw and spear Hulk class opponents. Yep. Running. Uh,
[1528.49s -> 1541.78s]  definitely bowling. Yes. Give me this. Create a spherical bowling ball. Nice. But I want bowling
[1543.46s -> 1554.84s]  cyclone skyjack ride any aircraft to its death or pummel it. Yes. Thank God.
[1555.48s -> 1566.62s]  Dashing ground slam dash into a classic ground smash, clearing a crowd of enemies from Hulk's
[1566.62s -> 1578.22s]  path. Yes. What else we got? Gamma quake. Use Hulk's, use Hulk size foes for an area of effect
[1578.22s -> 1591.62s]  attack. David, it's a superhero prototype also made by the Simpsons hit and run devs.
[1591.62s -> 1605.11s]  This is literally an RKO. Why did you read that? Like a restaurant commercial? I did.
[1605.19s -> 1613.51s]  I don't know. Cause it was like classic. Oh, turn this into a classic. They usually say that before
[1613.51s -> 1617.91s]  they say like their classic pasta or their classic breadsticks or their classic Italian
[1617.91s -> 1622.15s]  cuisine or pair it with a classic red wine. I don't know. That's what they say. Classic. Hey,
[1622.15s -> 1632.95s]  you posted cringe, bro. Thanks for the five community subs. Thanks a lot. We need a bunch
[1632.95s -> 1639.67s]  of uranium 235 from the nuclear power plant. Chances are Blonsky knows we're coming. Thankfully,
[1639.67s -> 1646.95s]  you know your way around fissionable material. Locate two fuel. All right. Get retrieve fuel
[1646.95s -> 1654.58s]  rods. That's all I have to do is get fuel rods. There's nothing else on the list of things.
[1654.58s -> 1679.45s]  It's just get rods. Found them. Those look really unstable. A couple of fuel rods. I want you to
[1679.45s -> 1683.45s]  know. I mean, nothing against you personally. And this should happen in the circumstances.
[1683.77s -> 1690.41s]  Homer working like this place. I'm sorry. Banner. I don't have a choice. Neither of us do.
[1691.85s -> 1703.27s]  Who is this? I'm different than all your other. I just, I got one hit.
[1705.27s -> 1707.03s]  Is there like a, how to not get hurt?
[1735.54s -> 1739.30s]  Get all of the guys. Okay. Let me figure out a fight. You know,
[1739.54s -> 1742.58s]  the boss fight, but then that just did a boss fight. I'm going to.
[1743.78s -> 1781.26s]  Worst gets going. Throw shit at her. Did you actually just say wrong? Where? All right,
[1781.26s -> 1814.76s]  we're good. Jump rope. No wrong move. All right. You can't do charge attacks on her. You got to be
[1814.84s -> 1858.26s]  quick. Call me a baby. What'd you say? First try. I think so too.
[1867.70s -> 1893.30s]  You're annoying. Stop doing that. Why? All right. That's it. You came to me this time.
[1893.30s -> 1903.50s]  You're the idiot.
[1910.54s -> 1941.93s]  What kind of jail is this? It's an interesting prison. No, no, no. I just tried to butt drop her.
[1944.60s -> 1957.69s]  Oh my goodness. All right. Help me. Critical mass is where I have to shine.
[1958.81s -> 1963.64s]  Oh yeah. Well, I learned this. I don't have it anymore. Nevermind.
[1963.64s -> 1980.60s]  I didn't learn it apparently. Turns out I don't know shit lady. Come on. Get over here.
[1990.01s -> 2006.04s]  Give me this thing. It didn't hit her. What? What's happening? I don't know. Stop.
[2015.30s -> 2018.26s]  Don't. Oh, come on. How did it just come to me?
[2031.42s -> 2046.09s]  You like it? Come here. All right. Now we act like a coward. Wait a minute. No, go in.
[2046.25s -> 2069.11s]  Don't go. Go on. Be a coward again.
[2080.49s -> 2096.97s]  Run. Nice. Can I hang on the walls? Can I just jump on the ceiling?
[2098.09s -> 2129.34s]  There's just so many. What the? Oh, I'm so mad by that one. Kick her. Kick her in the face.
[2131.61s -> 2132.65s]  This. Okay.
[2151.78s -> 2178.25s]  Do you see the placement on those beams? Get the fuck. No. But they're eventually going to get me.
[2178.25s -> 2221.93s]  See? No, don't jump at her. Okay. This one's not that powerful. Step on her head. Fuck you. Yeah.
[2234.38s -> 2240.71s]  Listen to me, banner. You don't understand. I had no choice.
[2241.51s -> 2247.62s]  It's Blonsky. He puts some kind of tracking device in my head. Never safe.
[2249.46s -> 2254.92s]  Don't you think you should have written that on a piece of paper and held it up beforehand?
[2256.20s -> 2261.80s]  You know what I mean? We could have saved ourselves an entire epic boss fight if you just held up a
[2261.80s -> 2271.58s]  fucking note that said all this. I do. It's got a tracking thing in your head. Just text it to me.
[2272.54s -> 2296.09s]  He can't read. He can. All right. Leave him a voicemail. This is before phones, but he can't.
[2296.89s -> 2310.74s]  Hulk has a phone? Yeah. Floor kick. Deliver instant disrespect with the floor kick.
[2311.38s -> 2317.99s]  I don't care how much it is. I'm getting it. Increase the power of critical mass. Yeah.
[2321.35s -> 2333.26s]  Elbow drop. What? There's so many moves. There are too many moves. That's all I can do.
[2339.11s -> 2349.19s]  Hey, Willakilla, thanks for the five subs. Five community subs. Appreciate it. Just dropping
[2349.19s -> 2368.49s]  those. Sick. Now grind around town. Don't worry, I will. Blansky's. It's all Blansky. Blonsky.
[2372.76s -> 2375.48s]  Thousands of people just left. Fucking Bugleberry decides to start talking.
[2376.36s -> 2388.70s]  Bye, guys. What's happening to me? My darling scientists aren't supposed to fear.
[2395.72s -> 2411.64s]  I should be just out of going. Oh, I just swallowed air. Sorry. Cool. Blonsky file detected.
[2412.36s -> 2423.21s]  I already bought all the moves. Let me try the, um, what was it? Disrespect. Let's go to the city.
[2432.62s -> 2438.62s]  Next mission is clean sweep. I can see it. All right. Let's try the elbow drop.
[2439.90s -> 2452.38s]  Oh, wait, do I have to? Oh, there it is. That's so stupid. I do it from the second rope.
[2453.34s -> 2481.24s]  All right. Let's try this on somebody. It works.
[2487.90s -> 2493.99s]  That move is so good. It's so good. I'm going to use that all the time. Oh, the grind. Right.
[2493.99s -> 2518.97s]  Okay. So get a shield, right? Okay. This is bad. This is, how is this? This is slower than running.
[2519.85s -> 2589.54s]  Can I jump like this? This is Tony Hawk. Why is it playing twice? Why is it playing twice?
[2595.14s -> 2605.59s]  Cause I haven't got, whoops. Hold on. All right. Hold on. Here we go.
[2635.00s -> 2646.81s]  I don't know when you can do that in Tony Hawk. All right. Let's get this. Hey,
[2646.81s -> 2651.61s]  thanks for the five community subs adventure MF Dan and five from Mandalore. Thank you both of you.
[2652.25s -> 2660.30s]  Play it like Superman. Oh, there's a place where everyone can be happy.
[2662.12s -> 2669.27s]  My fucking world. All right. Let's go first. Just give me one second.
[2672.18s -> 2688.41s]  Okay. Now I know why this game, now I see why this game is fun. They added an elbow drop.
[2689.34s -> 2694.26s]  Now I get it. What about the bowling ball? I need a big thing to bowl.
[2714.06s -> 2725.34s]  Out of mana. Can't do that. Out of mana. Fuck. I gotta get back in the portal. Fuck.
[2725.34s -> 2728.70s]  Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Okay. I'm all right. How many guys do I have left?
[2731.29s -> 2760.33s]  Two? Fuck. Okay. I gotta go grind again. Wait, who is that? Bruce. No, get. Come on. You're so
[2760.33s -> 2766.98s]  slippery and sticky at the same time. How? Blonsky is overseeing the deployment of gamma suppressing
[2766.98s -> 2772.34s]  gas pods throughout the downtown core. We don't have time to get into the quantum electrochemistry.
[2772.90s -> 2778.50s]  Bottom line, exposure to this gas will render you comatose in seconds. It seems the gas is a
[2778.50s -> 2783.46s]  blend of two slowly reacting agents, giving us a brief window for action. Throw them in the ocean.
[2783.46s -> 2788.26s]  You'll have to grab each pod, haul it to the coastline and toss it into the ocean before
[2788.26s -> 2797.21s]  you lose consciousness. Move fast. Have to move and get that gas pod away from you. It could cause
[2797.21s -> 2814.14s]  you damage. Just throw it into the drinking supply of the whole city. Locate military gas pods,
[2814.14s -> 2820.65s]  safely dispose of military gas pods. Don't drink ocean water. Where do you think your water comes
[2820.65s -> 2832.90s]  from? Ding dong. Comes from the ocean. Comes from water in the earth. Well, I located the...
[2833.54s -> 2856.60s]  There's a big guy here. Wait. Punch. Did it work? We'll be right back. Right? Somebody do it.
[2856.60s -> 2858.76s]  Somebody do it. Somebody do it. Somebody do it. Somebody do it. Somebody do it. Somebody do it.
[2859.64s -> 2873.05s]  All right. I could use my fucking secret technique on this guy.
[2873.77s -> 2905.61s]  I missed. Turns out it's a whole lot harder to get this. Punch the missile. I didn't get
[2905.61s -> 2921.27s]  jibated. I need to do a running uppercut on this guy. You bet. Here I'm gonna do the xxxxxx punch
[2921.27s -> 2936.46s]  combo. Hulk is a demon. Uh, no. I mean, he's not biblical in any way. That doesn't make any sense
[2936.46s -> 2953.30s]  to me. Grab onto him. I tried that. Are you gonna... Seriously? Are you kidding me? Look, grab.
[2954.02s -> 2966.04s]  I can't grab him. I gotta say grab him. There's no... I can't grab him. There's no grab. I got a
[2966.04s -> 3010.73s]  better idea. Did it work? Turn. Turn. I can't even control him anymore. All right. I'm on a Disney
[3010.73s -> 3018.58s]  ride right now. Whoa. Look behind you. Take a picture. Take a picture. Oh my God. Look. He's
[3018.58s -> 3029.30s]  right there. Wow. Holy shit. That was crazy. Where do they get the technology to do this shit?
[3030.10s -> 3042.15s]  Look. Here he comes. Oh my God. Whoa. Mom. Mom. Here he comes. Mom. Keep grabbing my fucking arm.
[3042.15s -> 3053.50s]  Hard. Ow. Mom. Let go of my fucking arm. I'm sorry, sweetie. Mom. Jesus. I probably marks here
[3053.50s -> 3073.00s]  now. I have a sunburn there too. Look. Here come the missiles. Oh, what the fuck. Don't worry.
[3073.08s -> 3088.66s]  They were not... What? Why did I come back? Why did I come back? Wait. Police. I need your help.
[3089.30s -> 3109.02s]  You want to go toe to toe? You can do that. You tried to grab me, didn't you? Whoopsie.
[3115.69s -> 3133.42s]  Got it. Finish him with an elbow drop. No. Why would I need to finish him with an elbow drop?
[3134.14s -> 3145.27s]  Finish him with a slash. Fuck. I shouldn't have done that that loud. Listen to my voice. Listen
[3145.27s -> 3149.67s]  to this. I have this in my air pocket in my... Right now, there's an air pocket in my throat.
[3149.67s -> 3156.82s]  God, I lost it. Did I lose it? Yeah. Fuck. You know when you're eating and your voice...
[3156.82s -> 3162.02s]  The food gets stuck in a really weird place where your vocal cords are and you end up with this
[3162.02s -> 3166.90s]  crazy voice that can never be replicated? I love when that happens and I try to keep it as long as
[3166.90s -> 3174.50s]  I can. I try to make phone calls when that happens to me. Calling people that I know. Like,
[3174.50s -> 3179.86s]  here it is. Here it is. Okay. Okay. Calm down. And I'll call like fucking friends and family
[3179.86s -> 3186.34s]  members and be like, hey, we're not just checking in. That's me imitating it, but it sounds insane
[3186.98s -> 3199.08s]  when you actually do it. People are like, ermy? Like, yeah. Fucking weirdo. You're a weirdo.
[3199.08s -> 3224.81s]  Oh, we got another big guy. Can I handle it? He can't even fucking drive. The psycho helicopters
[3224.81s -> 3245.83s]  are here. The camera can't even keep up with me because of the helicopters. What? Come here,
[3245.83s -> 3262.63s]  I'm grabbing it. I'm so happy I have that move now. That move is so good. 8 out of 0.9 out of 10
[3262.63s -> 3270.17s]  Xbox magazine. No, I would say this is probably a 2,000 for 8 out of 10. I mean, this is pretty good.
[3290.58s -> 3294.74s]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Is there another one? Oh, it's this guy.
[3295.78s -> 3314.22s]  The missiles... I shit don't even work in this scenario. I'd rather just go up and punch him.
[3314.38s -> 3334.54s]  This shit ain't even reliable. What? Go the X, X, X, X, X combo. Yeah, it's an X, X,
[3334.54s -> 3350.81s]  pause. X, X, X, X, X, right. X, X, X, pause. X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, pause.
[3351.53s -> 3381.10s]  You have to stand still for too long. It's not reliable. Get that fucking help, Q.
[3381.10s -> 3420.50s]  I'll be going the wrong way. I don't have time to walk around. Give me the help. I want
[3420.50s -> 3438.66s]  steel fists. Thank you. No. Okay, pick that up. Throw gas into the ocean. Oh, this is
[3438.66s -> 3454.09s]  the gas pod. Throw the gas pod by using Y and then rotating L counterclockwise. What?
[3455.59s -> 3460.15s]  No, I just, I thought you throw it in the ocean. You don't throw it into the ocean.
[3461.11s -> 3489.14s]  Got it, right? All right, next one. I'm coming. Action. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go.
[3491.22s -> 3518.87s]  Action. Go, go, go, go, go. Wait, point. I got to get some of these. 10,000 smash points.
[3526.15s -> 3530.63s]  Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger. Bowl the burger.
[3536.54s -> 3549.27s]  Denny's. Fuck. You said the word Denny's. No, I want it. Shit. I wanted Denny's. I can't,
[3549.27s -> 3558.44s]  though. I can't get that. I'm going to bowl the burger. Just hold on. I need a good opportunity.
[3570.87s -> 3575.24s]  Imagine coming into the stream right now. Like, what were you thinking?
[3576.20s -> 3579.24s]  What's this cheeseburger? What the heck? Hulk with a cheeseburger?
[3579.80s -> 3597.61s]  This has got to be a mod. Stop, stop, stop. Come on. Come on. Let me, let me have this one.
[3601.22s -> 3606.66s]  You guys, all of you right now, you better do it. The one person that comes in here that we're just
[3606.66s -> 3610.26s]  going to, they're going to think it's like really funny. We're going to, they're going to really
[3610.26s -> 3617.26s]  think that's what we think. This is funny. Everyone has to be like burger XD, like laughing burger,
[3617.26s -> 3627.64s]  like what the fuck? Eat it. Yum. Like stuff like that. Like, oh, he looks hungry. Be as
[3627.64s -> 3646.68s]  horny as possible. Okay. Ready? And action. What? You wait for me. I've got a burger. Hey,
[3646.68s -> 3652.36s]  what, what do you want some? What do you want some? You can't have any. It's my burger. Only mine.
[3654.33s -> 3661.14s]  Man, I thought, I thought I was hungry. What the heck? What the heck is going on here?
[3663.93s -> 3677.91s]  Everyone's a piece of my burger. All right. I'll share it with you. Oh, whoops. Yum. Yum. Yum.
[3679.35s -> 3702.76s]  It's just so yummy. All right. Watch this. Hey, who ordered it? But this is funnier. This is
[3702.76s -> 3715.42s]  funnier. Oh, I'm using my burger head as a battering ram. Oh, watch out. It's me. Hope
[3715.42s -> 3735.08s]  burger head delivering up fresh beef. Okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop it. I demand
[3735.64s -> 3762.89s]  stop. Oh shit. I'm in trouble. It was horrible. That's enough. I just said it was enough.
[3763.85s -> 3774.57s]  Okay. So how many people came and left? What do you think? More than five. I would say probably
[3774.57s -> 3800.17s]  three. Hey, fucking relax. Oh my God. These helicopters are unbelievable. I think, you know
[3800.17s -> 3804.65s]  what? I think the worst part about that one was, was the like, I'm eating it like yum, yum, yum,
[3804.65s -> 3808.97s]  yum thing. I think that might have been the worst part. I, that, that's where I would have left.
[3808.97s -> 3825.91s]  Right. Where is it? I know it's here. How are you still even flying around like that? You have no
[3825.91s -> 3862.06s]  health. You're exploding. That was just showing off for the camera. Okay. Oh, I want the helicopter
[3862.06s -> 3893.51s]  that's flying. Where's the helicopter? You've got to be fucking kidding me. You guys didn't think
[3893.51s -> 3900.31s]  this was the finale of the 4th of July. Really? Okay. So what, how would you keep telling me that
[3900.31s -> 3904.47s]  of what I said yesterday was not accurate? I'd love to hear about your thesis on that.
[3923.26s -> 3929.69s]  Why can I not punch the missiles back? I gotta, I gotta get out of this. I'm just gonna grab the
[3929.69s -> 3941.35s]  thing and run. Like why even fight these things? It's just like not even, not even possible.
[3942.15s -> 3959.37s]  Not even possible. This game's impossible. Wait, did I not even? Come on. No fucking way.
[3960.33s -> 3963.53s]  What are you talking about?
[3968.41s -> 3974.01s]  I was right. I don't even need to do the stupid big long-winded animation. Just throw it in.
[3974.89s -> 3986.17s]  I don't have to do this long-winded Mario thing. Just, just throw it in. Yeah, make sure we get
[3986.17s -> 3993.11s]  her. Do a hammer throw. No, I don't have to do that. Let's jump, uh, king spot right here.
[3997.80s -> 4009.77s]  Good. All right. Wait, how is he following me this well? Like how is it possible you follow
[4009.77s -> 4015.53s]  me that directly? He's 10 times bigger than me. More than that. Like he's probably 25 times larger
[4015.53s -> 4045.85s]  than I am. Let's just skate. All right, I forgot this is the missile game right here. Make funny
[4045.85s -> 4050.25s]  burger joke. We already did it. Didn't you laugh at it? We were here when we all laughed at it.
[4051.29s -> 4062.44s]  It was very, very, very funny. So throw it into the ocean so I can just turn around and just drop
[4062.44s -> 4071.75s]  it in. Holds up burger. I mean, it holds up burger. Wait, is that you're doing the holds up like
[4071.75s -> 4122.95s]  spork thing? Did I make it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Into the ocean. Got it. I win. Mission complete.
[4123.67s -> 4137.05s]  Okay, I did it. So now good. New Blonsky files. Well, I win. No, I do. All right. Next story,
[4137.05s -> 4160.23s]  a bird in the hand. Do I have 93,000? No, I didn't want that. Um, exactly what I wanted.
[4160.87s -> 4194.07s]  Okay, can I get a reset here? Can I get a reset of the map? Let's go back to the church where
[4194.07s -> 4204.52s]  it's safe. $50 came in from Goiki. Thank you Goiki for the $5,000. Sorry, I was doing a little bit
[4204.52s -> 4214.34s]  yelling there. $5,000 bits from Goiki. $50. They say everyone tweet hashtag burger. Get it trending.
[4214.34s -> 4219.32s]  I think it already is. I'm pretty sure all popular food items always have like
[4219.32s -> 4230.28s]  10 to 20,000 tweets a minute. It's not going to take very much. I'm just gonna buy moves.
[4231.16s -> 4238.47s]  But thanks for the $50, Goiki. Thanks for the ridiculous amount of bits. Appreciate it. A ton
[4238.47s -> 4250.92s]  of fucking money. And thanks for your hashtag burger. All right, 93,000. Air critical. How do
[4250.92s -> 4267.45s]  I not have? Don't I already have it? Super air dash. Yes. Really important. Hitchhike. Finally,
[4267.45s -> 4279.82s]  I can grab onto those guys. Critical mass, sir. Okay. What about health? Shield grind kick.
[4281.10s -> 4296.94s]  Wait, is it a kick flip? Definitely get the kick flip. Missile catch. Catch incoming missiles and
[4296.94s -> 4313.16s]  hurl them back. Couldn't buy that one fast enough. I want a burger now. Okay, go get one.
[4313.16s -> 4320.12s]  Well, no. Well, you can't. No, you can't. Make one. We need to get a handle on these new powers.
[4323.51s -> 4331.93s]  Just get one. I know. I just said that. I know. Well, I mean, if you could get it from a stop
[4331.93s -> 4337.08s]  watching. Why did you? Why? I didn't say that. Yeah. Why would you say that? Still get some.
[4337.96s -> 4341.08s]  Some drive ups here still are available. Takeout is available, right?
[4342.76s -> 4357.66s]  All right, let's do this. All right. Grab and then throw it back. Well, that was off the screen.
[4357.66s -> 4367.91s]  I couldn't see it. Uncle burger at home. Yeah, you can do that. To be in Ross's shoes. The
[4367.91s -> 4374.84s]  military's insurance bill is going to skyrocket. Wait, you just throw it back.
[4381.59s -> 4388.04s]  You're not supposed to do it like that, but okay. You catch it and then you hold B.
[4388.84s -> 4394.01s]  I just whipped it back. All right, let's go. Well, I can only grab one at a time,
[4394.01s -> 4396.49s]  so it doesn't really matter. Ash is much better though.
[4410.33s -> 4418.74s]  Hulk is a stoner. You know, I was thinking about saying the oh, I hold the missile and it's like a
[4418.74s -> 4422.74s]  big joint, right? I was thinking about it, but that figured it was that was going to put a lot
[4422.74s -> 4427.30s]  of minus twos in the chat. But somebody you said it so you can take the blame on that one.
[4428.26s -> 4455.18s]  No funny weed. I didn't say it. I told you I didn't say it. Holy shit. That's really far.
[4464.66s -> 4478.73s]  That's is there a level three on this too? I hope so. I smoked a bong today. Well,
[4480.39s -> 4483.67s]  I would really highly recommend not like breaking down glass and smoking.
[4487.00s -> 4505.34s]  I hope that's not what you mean. You know, I'm so hungry. I need a big burger. I'm so
[4505.42s -> 4507.90s]  hungry. Cut his mic. No, keep it on.
[4523.10s -> 4526.86s]  Wait for the cop. Wait, wait till the copter lands and then grab fuel rod.
[4527.50s -> 4536.65s]  Stop doing the burger. Funny thing. We did that already. You're scaring away new viewers.
[4537.61s -> 4557.42s]  47 seconds. Reap what you sow. Yeah, and I guess I did. I reaped what I sowed.
[4558.86s -> 4574.70s]  I pulled the plant up. We've cultivated it and it's gone now. I planted those seeds
[4575.42s -> 4579.51s]  and then the harvest came and we harvested that joke and now it's done.
[4580.55s -> 4606.17s]  I'm not even fucking there. It doesn't count. You can't just smoke the jokes without sharing, bro.
[4607.05s -> 4636.81s]  We gotta just bunny hop. Let's waste the time. Just do this. Only this.
[4638.01s -> 4650.71s]  Okay. That was, I made up so much more time there. All right. I made it. Helicopter coming in.
[4651.43s -> 4687.37s]  Punch helicopter. Good. Hey, destroy helicopter. He's going fast. What the fuck? I don't understand.
[4687.37s -> 4699.82s]  What is a jet flying around the building? What in the name of God? How did it even get over there?
[4713.26s -> 4759.24s]  Come here. Come over here. He's too fast. Think fast. All right. Now, thanks for giving me any
[4759.24s -> 4768.07s]  time at all that you can figure out what the hell is happening. Just beat these guys up. You know
[4768.07s -> 4773.78s]  what I mean? Just beat them up. I don't have a time limit. This guy's going to follow me the fuck
[4773.78s -> 4799.75s]  around for that. I don't think. No, don't do an elbow. I can't. I have to. All right. Now do it.
[4799.75s -> 4808.97s]  This is like fighting with like, this is fighting with hulk hands with like your little brother.
[4808.97s -> 4818.20s]  You know what I mean? Watch out. Oh, I'm going to get you. This is how you jump. I'm coming like
[4818.20s -> 4840.14s]  off the sofa. I'm so bad. I'm not. He's just so good. Thank you. Thanks. I humiliate him.
[4845.58s -> 4865.03s]  10,000 smash points. Okay. Now I'm ready. Wait inside the building. Oh, I got another 10,000
[4865.03s -> 4878.62s]  smash points. I meant to do that. Oh shit. I didn't get it. No, I don't get it. I have to.
[4881.62s -> 4899.46s]  Oh, you think so? You think you're in control? This fuel cell. Oh,
[4901.78s -> 4907.32s]  he called in. Oh, speaking of. Oh, wait. No, don't. Oh my God. I'm going to break this.
[4910.12s -> 4949.48s]  I don't want to break it. Okay. Give me this. Just pick it up. Get it. Oh my God. This fucking
[4949.48s -> 4960.95s]  just nestled everywhere. Where's that jump pad? Am I? Where am I? This thing's, this thing's gonna
[4960.95s -> 4971.85s]  crack. Pick up the hamburger. I'm not going to pick up the fucking hamburger.
[5005.27s -> 5026.66s]  Just missed me motherfucker. Added 15,000 smasher points. Be patient. Closer than we've ever been.
[5033.24s -> 5036.86s]  To break any moment. He can't keep the beast inside him.
[5038.46s -> 5049.56s]  Once we capture him, I'll transformation. I'm beginning to understand the appeal.
[5050.12s -> 5065.69s]  What was that noise by the way? Wrong with this guy. Yep. People say that every day.
[5065.69s -> 5077.45s]  Okay. Doesn't mean it's true. I have to get across the city, Bruce now, but we're under lockdown.
[5077.45s -> 5081.77s]  My division informant has a new decrypt code. I need that info. And he's not
[5081.77s -> 5088.41s]  by the roadblocks. I don't like it. Something's wrong here. Just worry about keeping me safe.
[5088.41s -> 5093.13s]  Keep Doc Sampson alive. What is he going to be walking around with like a briefcase?
[5093.13s -> 5102.01s]  Heck Sampson. He's going to be in a car. I feel like he's going to be in a limo.
[5102.01s -> 5114.15s]  Right. Don't you see that? I foresee this guy in a limousine. Nope. He's in an SUV. Okay.
[5118.44s -> 5125.03s]  Am I in that car? I just ran somebody over.
[5131.72s -> 5149.88s]  Oh, he's driving. How is this driving? Protect Sampson's car. From what exactly?
[5150.44s -> 5165.38s]  We couldn't have got a better car than this. Can't we get like an armored car? Why don't we get
[5165.38s -> 5170.79s]  like a Subaru Outback? You think we would get a fucking armored car with like bulletproof glass
[5170.79s -> 5193.34s]  and oh, the roadblock. All right. Go on. You go. Go. Full speed ahead. Oh, there's tanks here.
[5193.34s -> 5217.58s]  Nevermind. Stay there. I can't pick up the debris. Try this again.
[5217.58s -> 5232.14s]  Here comes a meltdown mission. No, not yet. You get the tank grab upgrade. I should get all upgrades
[5232.14s -> 5244.68s]  guys. So they're looking for suspicious activity. So instead of just driving normally, you decide
[5244.68s -> 5257.11s]  to run the guy over. Why didn't you just like just lie to these people? Excuse me, sir. I'm with
[5257.11s -> 5263.54s]  Uber Eats. Oh, okay. All right. Right. Good. I'm delivering a package. I'm working for the post
[5263.54s -> 5275.50s]  office. Oh, okay. All right. See you later. Package from Uber Eats. No, I'm just saying like
[5275.50s -> 5306.87s]  people that deliver stuff. Oh, that would have been so bad. I just dropped a fridge on him.
[5306.87s -> 5335.66s]  All right. Catch him. There's a psycho chopper. Hold on. Let me take care of this. No, pick it up.
[5336.30s -> 5365.53s]  Give me the help. Help. Oh, he's still alive. This motherfucker's almost dead. Where's this
[5365.53s -> 5385.16s]  other person? Oh my god. Burger. Let me have that one. Please let me have that one. Please.
[5387.43s -> 5392.97s]  I know you guys are thinking the same thing. I know you are. Okay. Let's block him.
[5395.69s -> 5423.46s]  I'll get in my car. We can drive around together. Wait, where's it? I get it. Fade away. I love
[5423.46s -> 5443.35s]  doing the fade away. It's the best. It's the most fun. Banner. Banner. Surrender banner. Don't go
[5443.35s -> 5464.46s]  right next to the tank, you idiot. Oh, he's left. He left. He left. He left. He's fine.
[5465.10s -> 5516.01s]  This is a pretty strong car in front of us. God damn it. Hit it. Hit him. Oh, this is bad.
[5516.65s -> 5552.74s]  Holy shit. I'm dead. Oh, this one's going to suck. I need the tank upgrades. Yeah. All right.
[5553.46s -> 5555.70s]  I'll give it one more go and then I'm going to get the tank upgrade.
[5556.34s -> 5580.95s]  The throw tank. Watch that same guy get hit. All right. We got to make this quick. He already
[5580.95s -> 5591.35s]  left. All right. Stay with him the whole time. I got to make it quick. Get the fists. Stay with
[5591.35s -> 5601.08s]  him. Keep it around at least 80% health if I can. I'll try. Where are we at? Right here. First block.
[5601.64s -> 5637.30s]  Am I getting ahead of him? I'm just going to get ahead of him. What am I even supposed to do?
[5637.30s -> 5655.10s]  I'm not getting hit by a thousand missiles. Okay. Well, when they fire 10 million rounds at you,
[5657.10s -> 5677.30s]  I'm getting a tank upgrade. We tried catching missiles. Well, the interesting thing about the
[5677.30s -> 5685.86s]  catching missile upgrade is you catch one while 60 hits you in the back. It's interesting how
[5685.86s -> 5707.37s]  that works. No, don't start that one. All right. I need, I want like 70,000 points.
[5708.09s -> 5723.67s]  Let's do a mission. Are you guys still on board, girl? Get the soldier into the air as many times
[5723.67s -> 5734.74s]  as possible without letting him touch the ground. All right. Let's give it a try. Can I use grabs?
[5734.74s -> 5737.70s]  Can I just throw him up and catch him and throw him up and catch him and throw him up and catch
[5737.70s -> 5779.24s]  him? Hey, juggle the soldier. Did I fail? I got one. Wait a minute. Is it X and like up or X and
[5780.52s -> 5790.01s]  do it away from him or something? Right. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. I get it. So
[5790.01s -> 5812.78s]  go like this. Oh, you got to hit back and X at the same time. Give me a bit of camera angle.
[5812.78s -> 5826.01s]  This camera is terrible. Maybe don't even lock on. Should I not lock? No, you have to lock on.
[5839.30s -> 5862.42s]  Ah, shit. Lock on changed. Give me a 10. 10. No. Well, got it. Silver medal. I don't care.
[5862.42s -> 5885.93s]  That's fine. 4,000 points. Cool. This guy's a silver streamer. I'd rather have the silver
[5885.93s -> 5888.97s]  medal. Then haven't we talked about this? How second place is better than first place?
[5889.93s -> 5895.77s]  Because I was very, very good, but I don't have to, I don't have to be the best because then I have
[5895.77s -> 5904.58s]  a ton of expectations. You get in first place, then all of a sudden you're the expectation now.
[5905.14s -> 5920.79s]  I don't want first place. I want second place. In fact, I want like fourth place because you did
[5920.79s -> 5924.15s]  really good. You didn't like place, but holy shit, like how many people were doing that?
[5924.87s -> 5931.46s]  Well, there was like 40 people doing that. Got to like eighth place. That's fucking kind of high.
[5932.10s -> 5941.72s]  That's pretty good. Okay. Use your club to hit the soldier as far as possible. Charge the attack
[5941.72s -> 5949.80s]  to increase the distance. See how far you can hit the soldier. Now, by the way, fourth place is
[5949.80s -> 5956.95s]  placing if you go by Super Nintendo Mario Kart standards. And that's the standards that I go by.
[5968.98s -> 5975.77s]  All right. I can get, I can do like 500 yards. All right. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. All right.
[5975.77s -> 5986.78s]  This is fun. You got to get a full charge. Oh, I got it. I could have done it a little earlier.
[5987.42s -> 6003.40s]  279. Oh, you got to get under it. That was all right. That was pretty good.
[6004.34s -> 6027.18s]  300. 300. I got under it. 384. Come on. 295. 300. Get it. Jump and do it.
[6029.34s -> 6042.57s]  I threw it. That's me. That guy just died for no reason. It doesn't work like that.
[6044.17s -> 6053.45s]  No, I'm hitting them. Oh, my chest.
[6057.74s -> 6070.12s]  For no reason. I know. I know. I know. But wait, let me try Y. That's definitely over 300 yards.
[6070.12s -> 6080.86s]  Holy shit. That's like 400. It's Y, not X. Get one more. I'm going to do this one again. I can
[6080.86s -> 6102.95s]  give, I definitely can do it. They all are dying for no reason. I know. And let's go like this.
[6103.75s -> 6124.73s]  It's a lot longer. Come on. 400. Oh, I got him right in the toe. I got way underneath him. That's
[6124.73s -> 6158.10s]  probably going to be pretty good. Come on. That was perfect. Oh, right. X and Y.
[6163.40s -> 6193.77s]  That didn't work. I'm just making him fall faster. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Try to do it.
[6194.25s -> 6206.07s]  I'm trying. I'll get it. I'll get it. Hold on. Got it. That was horrible. It was fucking terrible.
[6212.70s -> 6220.78s]  I'll get it right here. I'll get it right here. I'll get it right here. One more after this. I got
[6220.78s -> 6229.58s]  to get to 400. That would have been it. No, it wouldn't have. Knock them in the air, then do it.
[6231.24s -> 6247.11s]  Wait. Hold on. Hold on a second. You're telling me hit them and then throw it at them. Not a bad
[6247.11s -> 6254.17s]  idea. You'd be bad at baseball. Only baseballs don't come from the sky. They come forward.
[6254.73s -> 6284.25s]  Let's try this. Let's try this. It might work. Hold on. Oh, I think somebody called the police.
[6287.69s -> 6296.66s]  You're a little late. I'll be honest. I've been doing this for like two hours. Wait, what?
[6300.71s -> 6334.92s]  Let me use something else. Oh, no. Fuck. I tried running. I have to get gold on this.
[6341.62s -> 6375.13s]  Holy shit. He just said look out on his radio. Fuck. God. Stop jumping. I have to. I have to.
[6375.13s -> 6379.11s]  I have to. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm going to get like extra,
[6379.11s -> 6409.62s]  like if you jump and punch, like you know what I mean? No, it's the same. Holy shit. Hold on.
[6415.86s -> 6428.23s]  No, I didn't want to throw it behind me. Stop giving this to me.
[6436.66s -> 6441.99s]  I can do it. I'm going to want to do it with the pole. It's going to be 5,000 yards.
[6442.63s -> 6449.34s]  Can I just die? Retry. Restart. Here we go. I'm going to get the pole and I'm going to hit him
[6449.34s -> 6462.25s]  into the fucking stratosphere. Don't do it immediately. Just wait. Okay. Ready?
[6463.37s -> 6514.30s]  So like knock this down. I exploded. Oh, you motherfucker. That's going to be pretty good.
[6514.30s -> 6553.53s]  366. Fully charged hit won't go to 400. Why not? Throw it after hitting him. I'm trying that every
[6553.53s -> 6567.78s]  time. It's not going to make it. That was pretty far. 350, 360, 424. I got it. That's gold medal.
[6567.78s -> 6586.42s]  I just got it. All right. I can do better than that. It's right before you do the full charge.
[6587.22s -> 6611.54s]  That's going to be at least 400. Come on. One more shot. That's pretty good. That's going to be a
[6611.54s -> 6620.62s]  good one. And too bad it was the last one I just did. Oh, now that one's terrible. All right. I got
[6620.62s -> 6641.74s]  it. Gold medal. Now do a little dance. Yeah. All right. Jump to the church to acquire mission.
[6641.74s -> 6645.82s]  All right. So I want to do, I got $67. I want to do more. I like these little mini games. They're
[6645.82s -> 6653.72s]  fun. I'm going to do more of these. I'm going to do more of these. These are fun. Do a dance. I just
[6653.72s -> 6668.95s]  did because you don't see it. I'll do this last one. Then we'll do the story. I'm going to get
[6668.95s -> 6678.14s]  the tank upgrade. The one that makes it so I can kill tanks really easily. Oh no. I already did
[6678.14s -> 6688.54s]  that one. This one. Soldier seeker. Defeat as many enemies as possible before the time runs out.
[6688.54s -> 6715.16s]  Play the automaton. The automaton has a name. Kill everything. Get the guy up here first.
[6719.86s -> 6724.78s]  Where's the next one? On the building. Oh, that was not good.
[6726.86s -> 6745.02s]  Where is he? They're on the roofs. Where is he? Up top. It's both the helicopters. Oh my God.
[6745.02s -> 6770.07s]  Just forget to kill the guys on the ground first. You're going to fall off, aren't I?
[6770.95s -> 6805.90s]  I did let go. I didn't want to let go. Come here. How many yards? Okay. All right. All right.
[6805.90s -> 6814.89s]  Where's the last dude up there? That guy's fucking dead. One, two, three. All right. What's left?
[6815.53s -> 6831.43s]  He's alive. He's alive. He's alive. Oh, he's not. Oh, there's a guy right there. Oh, I got it.
[6834.33s -> 6839.58s]  Whatever. Bronze. Who cares? Winks are crashing. Sell. You can't even sell them. They don't exist
[6839.58s -> 6852.18s]  anymore. They've been delisted from the marketplace. You can't sell something that's
[6852.18s -> 6858.71s]  not even available to sell. All right. Let's go back to the church. We have 70,000 points.
[6859.98s -> 6877.96s]  We need to jump. All right. Here we go. What's the move called? The one that you're talking about?
[6878.68s -> 6903.40s]  Good one. It's called a wink. That'd be funny if it was. Okay. Sonic clap. Air enemy grapple. Yeah.
[6904.04s -> 6914.66s]  Got these. Elbow drop. Super air strike. No, no, no. Shockwave smash repeater. That's cool,
[6914.66s -> 6925.32s]  but I don't want it. Air critical thunderclap. Hammer toss. Grab and spin any tanks. There it is.
[6926.28s -> 6938.20s]  Okay. Grab a tank and then spin. Dirty ball and chain. Utilize a wrecking ball for wide
[6938.20s -> 6946.92s]  sweeping attacks. Air spike. From an air combo, slam Hulk's foes to the ground.
[6947.48s -> 6954.12s]  That's cool, but hold on. Target kick. Hulk can ride an aircraft and kick it toward the
[6954.12s -> 6960.46s]  target of your choice. I want that. I can throw one helicopter into the other helicopter.
[6961.26s -> 6972.76s]  Critical pain. Power surge level two. Oh, this is health. Running club ram.
[6973.72s -> 6985.61s]  Yeah, it gives me. All right. I'm going to save up now. Toontown. Isn't there, there's a,
[6985.61s -> 6993.38s]  I can't you play Toontown? Should I play Toontown? Isn't it like, isn't it like Toontown
[6993.38s -> 7007.62s]  reloaded or something or remastered? Sir Canine just gave $50. Thank you for the huge bit drop.
[7008.42s -> 7014.82s]  Thanks for the 5,000 bits. That's a lot of fucking money. 5,000 of them. And they say,
[7015.62s -> 7021.54s]  Germa, I've redeemed my Germa wank earlier for 10 million channel points and didn't even get one.
[7021.54s -> 7037.35s]  Can I get a Wink as a re recomp, recomp, recompensation? Why did you read that? Because
[7037.35s -> 7054.68s]  somebody gave me $50. That was a $50 donation. That was Sir Canine. No, you, there was never
[7054.68s -> 7060.52s]  any agreement for anything you're saying. Winks are delisted. They don't exist. Sorry. This is
[7060.52s -> 7076.30s]  the way it is. Where's this mission? Where's the mission? Isn't there a story mission here?
[7078.65s -> 7083.61s]  Scam. Oh, yeah. If you're looking for Winks, you scammed yourself because they're gone.
[7084.41s -> 7103.74s]  Very addicted to them. All right. Where's the story? Is this the wrong area or something? What's
[7103.74s -> 7127.74s]  going on? No burgers. Naked streamers scams viewers. I mean, another $50 from Sir Canine.
[7127.74s -> 7134.46s]  That's $100 in bits so far. That's 10,000 bits from Sir Canine. And they say that's a lot. Canine,
[7134.46s -> 7139.94s]  thanks for the hundred fucking dollars. That's insane. That's crazy. They say, does that mean
[7139.94s -> 7144.98s]  I can get a Germa wank because those aren't delisted? Also play Toontown. They were never
[7144.98s -> 7152.02s]  listed in the first place. Winks have been delisted. Wanks were never listed. So I'm sorry.
[7152.66s -> 7156.18s]  There is this. It was never listed in the first place.
[7162.26s -> 7182.15s]  How come this mission is not showing up? Soft low mega low. Oh, is the raw. Okay.
[7183.03s -> 7188.44s]  I have to get across this. Annoyings. Now, but we're. Thanks for the hundred bucks.
[7189.32s -> 7195.08s]  But I'm not. No, I'm not going to. No, I'm not going to do that thing. I'm not going to do that
[7195.08s -> 7199.48s]  on stream. I'm not going to do that. No, I'm not. All right. I'm done. We're done.
[7203.16s -> 7210.09s]  So here we go. Now I got the tank grabber move and I get a couple of hog champs for the tank
[7210.09s -> 7219.11s]  grabber move. Don't give in. There's no giving in. Are you talking? What are you talking about?
[7219.11s -> 7244.66s]  Don't give in. Protect whatever. I got the line wrong. Improvisation. Look it up. Captain do
[7244.66s -> 7260.38s]  anything. I knew you were sneaking up on me. You and your friend and I didn't even do the move.
[7271.06s -> 7291.59s]  Taking them into the ocean with me. I got them both. But that's a good start. Let me get. So
[7291.59s -> 7297.35s]  let me get this straight. We are doing. I'm getting the silent treatment right now because
[7297.99s -> 7301.43s]  you guys want me to let me get this right here. Let me make sure this is very clear.
[7302.39s -> 7308.07s]  You've given me the silent treatment because you are expecting me to masturbate on stream.
[7308.87s -> 7314.15s]  I just want to make sure I'm very clear about this. Is that really what we're doing?
[7315.11s -> 7335.00s]  How far have you fallen? Swing it. Swing it quick. Holy shit it works. Oh that's very easy now.
[7335.64s -> 7357.58s]  Did a boss that four days ago. Wait. Psycho coppers. Coppers. You know whatever. Got it.
[7357.58s -> 7369.67s]  Okay good. No I'm not going to give in. I'm not giving in. Why would I give in?
[7370.63s -> 7380.73s]  Why would I give in? This is not hog of you. Just standing next to the car. Just fucking run
[7380.73s -> 7389.34s]  them over man. I'm a not hog of you. No that's not going to happen. This hurricane I'm giving
[7389.34s -> 7396.62s]  another $50. Another 5,000 bits. $150 worth of bits have come in to try to get me to wink.
[7397.42s -> 7402.73s]  Not going to happen. Not going to happen. I'm sorry. It's not going to happen. They say a wink
[7402.73s -> 7406.81s]  would work. Not going to happen. I'm going to have to be honest with you. It's not happening.
[7407.61s -> 7418.50s]  I'm just going to crush them. Thanks for the insane amount of money. But I can't.
[7419.22s -> 7434.12s]  I can't. You can't relist something. Okay I'm doing this on my own. I want to do this because
[7434.12s -> 7442.76s]  I feel like doing it. Zit shut up. Shut up. How dare you say that to me right now.
[7448.47s -> 7455.19s]  Immediate. Immediate. Immediate. Zit. Immediate call out. The camera was on for a tenth of a second.
[7455.75s -> 7471.85s]  Zit. Oh yeah okay thank you. Nice room. Thanks. I think so too. I'm not. All right.
[7479.74s -> 7488.26s]  He's so far ahead of me. Oh shit. Is he all right? Okay. Why are you stopping here?
[7490.25s -> 7519.91s]  Why is he stopping? Oh my god the tanks. This wouldn't happen if you played Pathologic 2.
[7520.63s -> 7544.30s]  What the fuck are you talking about? Hurry dude. The uber food is getting cold.
[7548.14s -> 7568.46s]  Oh shit we're going to hit that guaranteed 25 minute delivery. Okay. Oh kick us up. Stop
[7568.46s -> 7576.73s]  driving. He's driving on the sidewalk. You're doing damage to yourself. Come on. We got tanks.
[7577.77s -> 7611.42s]  Watch this shit. Watch this shit. Somebody over here. Tank. Tank. Tank. God damn it. Watch your
[7611.42s -> 7633.75s]  fire. I gotta ball this. Into the tank. Ball it into the tank. Ball it into the tank.
[7634.39s -> 7663.19s]  Okay. Don't care anymore. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Done. Done. Another task.
[7663.83s -> 7692.54s]  Done. You can go now. Wait for me to get out of the way first. Fucking idiot. He is an idiot.
[7692.54s -> 7697.75s]  All right. He's an idiot. What do you want me to say? He's not an idiot.
[7698.47s -> 7702.63s]  And what he was doing right there was smart. You want me to not call the guy driving on the
[7702.63s -> 7715.45s]  sidewalk an idiot. Okay. Look at this. This guy's being controlled remotely by a shitty wi-fi signal.
[7716.25s -> 7733.53s]  Nobody even in that fucking car. Holy shit. What? Why am I taking damage? Oh. Whoa. Wow.
[7734.49s -> 7758.17s]  Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Unbelievable. Oh, there's a checkpoint. Oh. Okay. Here they come.
[7758.17s -> 7784.44s]  Come on. Drop. The Yeti's coming out. Fire is releasing.
[7791.02s -> 7808.90s]  How? All right. Throw it at somebody else. Thank God it works. I'm seeing F.
[7811.46s -> 7816.15s]  All right. F. I got zero drop frames. Why? Why are you guys doing this to me?
[7816.15s -> 7833.78s]  Don't tell them. Because you threw a tank at somebody. Oh. Why is it that I automatically
[7833.78s -> 7838.58s]  just assume that F means your internet's not working and your stream is dead? I think I'm
[7838.58s -> 7843.86s]  just so fucked up from having so many internet problems that I see FFF and I'm like, oh shit,
[7843.86s -> 7861.00s]  it's over. Internet says the stream's turned off. Stream's off. I'm so traumatized. All right. Let's
[7861.00s -> 7889.64s]  go. Pick him up and flick him. Ah, there it is. See you later. Not over. Wait. Oh. When are we
[7889.64s -> 7899.30s]  going to reach our destination? Can we get there? This guy's taking the shittiest route possible.
[7899.94s -> 7927.70s]  Watch this. Got a bolt. Why is he driving around like this? Come here. One of you. I'm catching this.
[7928.58s -> 7942.58s]  He got one off at the end. No, he did not. Give me your mic. Give me your mic. Give me your mic.
[7942.58s -> 7948.18s]  Hey. Hey. Streamer. Hey. Check your audio settings. Something might be wrong with them.
[7948.82s -> 7973.88s]  There's something wrong with your audio settings. There's so many. There's too many. I have to start
[7973.88s -> 7982.23s]  throwing cars, man. There's too many. Oh, that's his car. Wait. All right. Give me the tank or
[7982.23s -> 7993.67s]  something. Go, go. Please don't get killed. It's the same shit that happened last time.
[7994.47s -> 8028.10s]  What? Ah, give me help. Please. Holy fuck. I did it. That was horrible. The Blonsky file.
[8030.55s -> 8039.05s]  Big zip, man. You've been stressed. No, no, not at all. Not at all. My dog was just
[8040.01s -> 8047.37s]  in the hospital last week. Had to move during a global pandemic. It hasn't been any stress in my
[8047.37s -> 8068.87s]  life. Play Cities Skylines. Cry. Hey. Hey. Hold on. Hey. Hey. That was like a radio kind of YouTuber
[8068.87s -> 8094.87s]  hey. My other voice. You're at the peak of your power. Well, not yet. Not yet. Why does he sound
[8094.95s -> 8114.15s]  like that? I don't want to do the BB unit thing, but I will because I like it. It's fun. I might
[8114.15s -> 8134.76s]  just do it. I'm thinking about it. All right. This is called my other voice. Everything's coming to
[8134.76s -> 8140.52s]  fruition. Now I need you to strike at their heart. The division has set up a front in the financial
[8140.52s -> 8146.92s]  district and they're spreading their poison in plain sight. We can't allow them a foothold there.
[8146.92s -> 8152.28s]  What about civilians? There are no civilians in that vicinity anymore. It's just you versus them.
[8170.78s -> 8171.42s]  All right. I'm going to
[8181.74s -> 8197.26s]  defeat division forces. Destroy the fuel depot. Destroy everything.
[8199.34s -> 8203.21s]  As everyone. Germa gave out a wild to seven out of 10.
[8204.01s -> 8209.66s]  It's unfortunately untrue. I don't know why it's unfortunately untrue, but it's not true.
[8210.62s -> 8263.83s]  I feel like I just opened up G mod bond just 10 of every enemy and just put them all hostile
[8263.83s -> 8275.00s]  versus each other. You know, when you do that shit, see what happens with the total fucking carnage.
[8275.64s -> 8289.06s]  Oh dude, I wonder what happens when seven guys in suits fight 20 helicopters. This would be
[8289.06s -> 8295.29s]  interesting. And you forget about the tank that you spawned. It's just kind of there. Oh yeah. I
[8295.29s -> 8298.97s]  did spawn a tank. Fuck. I'm going to have to do this again. It's not, that's it. That's a bad
[8298.97s -> 8301.69s]  variable. This is not a good indicator. I'm going to have to get after the tank is gone.
[8317.30s -> 8338.54s]  There's just too many of them. I just, I really did just give that guy a diamond cutter. That's
[8338.54s -> 8352.30s]  an RKO. Yeah. How many of you guys remember? I remember being on a trampoline and having
[8352.30s -> 8358.60s]  to deal with these little wrestle buddy things that they were like two feet tall and they were
[8358.60s -> 8363.80s]  stuffed animal kind of things. It was like, Oh, Ted DiBiase and the ultimate warrior.
[8364.44s -> 8368.12s]  And I used to just do wrestling moves to these guys. You're supposed to, that wasn't a commercial
[8368.12s -> 8373.56s]  and shit. I would do wrestling moves to them on the trampoline. We would go over to a friend's
[8373.56s -> 8378.60s]  house and like, Oh, let's do wrestling moves. We would do shit like that. We'd pick them up
[8378.60s -> 8399.83s]  and give them like stunners DDT fucking exploded. Hi, please. I need your help. I need his help.
[8400.63s -> 8451.51s]  Explode. I can get the fucking help. Shield, please. Oh my God. You're kidding me. Run. Did I get
[8451.51s -> 8549.78s]  them? Okay. Run. Relentless. Oh, I want a coin. Why is this guy lit up? Dead. Hey, you little
[8549.78s -> 8593.88s]  fuck. They never stop. It never stops. Should never stop. Fucking headache mission. This whole
[8593.88s -> 8616.55s]  game is a headache. Yeah, I agree. Am I going to regen yet? What the fuck? They're gonna die.
[8617.75s -> 8623.75s]  It's just never ending. Insta 50,000 mile per hour helicopters just grind into buildings and
[8623.75s -> 8643.70s]  into walls and shit. Hey, look at this. I don't know what I'm looking at. You kids beat this.
[8643.78s -> 8649.50s]  Yeah, on because they put it on easy and they probably know they didn't bullshit. They played
[8649.50s -> 8653.82s]  on easy the first three levels and moved on to something else because kids have the attention
[8653.82s -> 8663.48s]  spans of fucking squirrels. Okay, that's incorrect. You're about I beat this game when I was a kid.
[8663.48s -> 8667.80s]  No, you beat the first level on easy and then you forgot it existed and then your mother
[8667.80s -> 8673.46s]  brought it to like a donation box. That's probably what happened before you sold it.
[8673.78s -> 8699.85s]  You're like dad sold it and he forgot about it and then 30 years later you ask your mom. Hey,
[8699.85s -> 8707.35s]  Bob. What happened to that? Wasn't there a Hulk game that we had before? Oh, yeah. I have no idea
[8707.35s -> 8711.75s]  what happened to that. You stopped playing that after 10 minutes, honey. Oh, really? Because I
[8711.75s -> 8715.91s]  keep telling the streamer on Twitch that like I beat every game we ever played and I just want
[8715.91s -> 8719.83s]  to like make sure that I have save files still so I can like fucking stick screenshot of the save
[8719.83s -> 8724.07s]  file and I got to the end of the fucking game and I'm gonna have a screenshot that says 2004
[8724.07s -> 8729.75s]  uh 4 6 0 6 p.m and it's gonna be the final mission of save file. Yeah, we don't have that.
[8733.14s -> 8753.66s]  No, honey. We don't. I need help. This is what it feels like to just put like a paper bag on
[8753.66s -> 8768.50s]  your head and just run around your room into fucking walls. It's the same thing. You don't
[8768.66s -> 8774.60s]  know what's happening. It's just I'm on like a shitload of drugs running around with like a bag
[8774.60s -> 8779.72s]  on my head or something. I have like a blindfold on on a bunch of fucking crack
[8781.00s -> 8798.28s]  circling the same room and this is what's going on in my head. There's mutants and aliens everywhere.
[8798.28s -> 8834.98s]  Oh shit we're under attack. I did catch this banner. Fuck you. I did it. My god.
[8835.70s -> 8874.92s]  It's sort of elbow drop. That's not it. Destroy all hulkbusters and then stomp them.
[8881.22s -> 8892.46s]  Go juggle and then he explodes and then we get help. One um what's it what they call busters?
[8893.83s -> 8912.71s]  No, punk punk buster. No, it's a hunk buster. One hunk buster. The incredible hunk.
[8913.59s -> 8920.36s]  That's definitely the name of uh that's the title of the porn. It has to be. You know,
[8920.36s -> 8925.94s]  that has to be. This guy like just painted green.
[8949.94s -> 8957.21s]  He's definitely like painted green like with fucking like I don't know like party store makeup.
[8957.93s -> 8961.75s]  It's just like streaks all over him. They didn't give a fuck. They didn't even try.
[8962.79s -> 8989.67s]  Like a third of the guy's back ain't even green. The hulk Halloween costume. Yeah,
[8989.67s -> 9003.05s]  but the hulk mask on. Oh yeah we're talking about one of those plastic hulk masks. The ones that
[9003.05s -> 9008.97s]  just barely cover the front of your face and aren't sized properly so sometimes your face
[9008.97s -> 9015.13s]  might be a little too big and your real chin cheeks and forehead bleed out on the edges.
[9016.01s -> 9038.28s]  I think I caught one. Huge one. Of course there's a big ass hulk buster. No,
[9038.28s -> 9088.41s]  fright him. Punch him in the fucking head. I can't even see. I'm gonna run this way for a
[9088.41s -> 9100.89s]  minute. Oh my god, I literally can't even. No, I can't even start crying Jupiter.
[9117.90s -> 9123.90s]  Break this building. How am I supposed to destroy this? Okay, I thought my head just got fucking
[9124.62s -> 9127.58s]  splattered on the back of that. Did you see how fucked up that looked?
[9148.87s -> 9157.29s]  Gotta get the fuck out of here. Gotta get the fuck out of here. I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[9158.25s -> 9179.14s]  No, don't go back. No, they're still fucking up my ass. Yeah, they're right on my ass.
[9188.17s -> 9210.90s]  Yeah, it's still behind me. Go, go, go, go, go. Keep regetting. Give me that health.
[9214.82s -> 9228.57s]  Oh, where is he? Sir, can I have my save file? I beat this game when I was six. I need to take
[9228.57s -> 9234.33s]  one final damage the whole entire video. Okay. Oh, I'm not sure how you can do this. Something
[9234.33s -> 9238.97s]  must be wrong with your brain. Your brain is not correctly wired or something. I don't know.
[9238.97s -> 9257.64s]  We'll be back in an hour to see if you beat this mission. All right, give me something to throw.
[9272.25s -> 9279.45s]  There's no way. There's no way. You would die five times to that without even the amount of
[9279.45s -> 9320.54s]  running that I'm doing. This is not even the Incredible Hulk. It's so fucking funny.
[9323.02s -> 9327.10s]  So how do you want me to? All right. All you got. How do you want me to do this one?
[9328.46s -> 9333.10s]  What move do I need to get to throw these guys? What move do I need to get to throw these guys?
[9336.55s -> 9344.54s]  All right. Thankfully, we don't have to do that whole thing again. Oh, that's fucking funny.
[9345.18s -> 9355.56s]  This is very funny. Okay. Stop throwing. All right. I know you're fucking kidding,
[9355.56s -> 9362.92s]  but imagine thinking at the extreme, extreme. I was trying to keep myself alive. Imagine thinking
[9362.92s -> 9369.50s]  the guy is throwing, but I was, I was trying so hard to not take it. Did I get a hit?
[9369.50s -> 9384.12s]  Thank you. What would throwing look like? Oh, that's funny. No, they're talking about
[9384.92s -> 9418.07s]  stop throwing stuff. Oh, all right. Let's go, Tony. I disagree. Throwing is pretty good.
[9418.95s -> 9431.75s]  Stay in the realm of possibility of don't. I'm going to, I'm going to skate through this first
[9431.75s -> 9446.97s]  part. Here it is. Take this guy out first. Do not move until this guy is dead. Take out the little
[9446.97s -> 9492.97s]  guys first. Okay. Give me one of those. Yeah. All right. I'm going to ram them.
[9497.26s -> 9514.01s]  Fuck. Grab me. Oh no. Reinforcements came in. That's bad. That help. Give me it right there.
[9514.01s -> 9541.24s]  There's two. Fuck the other ones here. I want to explode. Get the fuck out of here. Good.
[9541.88s -> 9563.69s]  Another one dead. Good. Oh, I'm ready. Let's go skate. All right. There's another big one here.
[9563.69s -> 9581.75s]  He's not aggroing 20 enemies. Pog. I know. I know, but use the critical mass. Don't worry.
[9581.75s -> 9608.82s]  I'm saving it for right now. Critical mass on the building. Do it. Yeah. Yeah.
[9615.91s -> 9635.34s]  Is it magnificent? How has there been 4,922 viewers here for the last hour straight?
[9636.14s -> 9651.80s]  That seems strange. Oh, okay. Destroy the armory and destroy all
[9652.36s -> 9672.84s]  unclusters. You can't look away. It's like watching a disaster.
[9673.64s -> 9693.96s]  Magnificent. Nice uppercut. I'm sorry. Is somebody shooting me from over here? I couldn't tell.
[9695.00s -> 9735.45s]  Not a bad idea. Except you're dead. Magnificent. And butt. And butt. And butt.
[9738.38s -> 9745.34s]  Uh, Mick Muscles. Thanks for the 10 community subs, Mick Muscles. That's a 10 drop. 10
[9745.34s -> 9752.73s]  community subs. Thanks a lot. Congratulations to those who got those fucking community subs.
[9753.61s -> 9778.50s]  Hulk in the chat. Critical mass. All right. Now we take on the big guys. Hulk actually in chat.
[9780.30s -> 9798.50s]  Maybe. Don't. Don't call him out. Let him just watch. Here, watch this one. We'll do a
[9798.50s -> 9804.28s]  simple little technique here it's called. Get grabbed and get thrown. I'll give you a fucking
[9804.28s -> 9826.36s]  technique. What's that? Okay, that's a street light. I thought it was like a jet. Good. All right,
[9826.36s -> 9831.32s]  they're both dead, right? Yep. All right, keep going. I want more, uh, I want my shield back.
[9831.96s -> 9863.00s]  Let's go. Here we go. Ah. Fun move to do. Give me those fists. Where the fuck are the jukes?
[9863.00s -> 9887.86s]  Where are the jukes? They're all, they're everywhere, man. Nope. Don't think so. Right
[9887.86s -> 9890.90s]  into my hands. Right into my hands. Right into my hands. Right into my hands. Throw them in the
[9890.90s -> 9904.81s]  fucking ocean. Oh, you have another DDT. Or a bulldog. You find yourself unable to cast sus.
[9904.81s -> 9923.48s]  The screen is live. Yes, it is. Apparently it is. Yeah, it is. I love doing the fadeaway.
[9924.04s -> 9929.42s]  You know, when I used to play basketball games, if I played an NBA game, I would, it didn't matter
[9929.42s -> 9934.06s]  if the shot was very easy. I would always jump backwards and fade away and shoot every single
[9934.06s -> 9949.14s]  time. It just was so satisfying. Everything about it. All right, here we go. Here's the building.
[9955.11s -> 9961.27s]  Holy shit. I thought the objects in the mirror are way huger than they appear in front of you.
[9961.27s -> 9965.19s]  What? I thought these are small. I thought they were the little ones. It's two huge ones.
[9971.64s -> 10002.79s]  Get it. I got it. Shit. You got a fire. That's just annoying. Wouldn't that be hurting me?
[10003.75s -> 10008.63s]  Wait, wait, wait. Frank, stop. Frank, stop attacking. He's hitting his fucking head into the metal
[10008.63s -> 10026.06s]  over and over again. He's just gonna die. Let him do it. All right, this is bad. I gotta run.
[10026.94s -> 10061.14s]  Yeah, I should have ran. I'm regenerating. That's a good thing because I can get help from you.
[10062.02s -> 10082.10s]  All right, here we go. Fight. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need that.
[10083.14s -> 10112.92s]  I can't go back there. What's even happening? I have no idea. It's almost impossible to tell.
[10113.56s -> 10117.80s]  It's 75% of the fights in this game. What is even happening on the screen?
[10118.52s -> 10140.74s]  I'm there with you. I have no idea. Where the fuck am I? It's because I have to keep running away
[10140.74s -> 10152.12s]  and I keep grabbing more of these fucking guys. Now it's like I can't beat it now.
[10153.53s -> 10169.83s]  There's like 30 people following me. I need to regenerate health. Kill one of these guys.
[10171.93s -> 10174.81s]  I can't even grab anything because they keep blowing it up before I can get it.
[10175.61s -> 10207.46s]  Go for the objective. They'll never stop fucking following me. He's gonna drop health.
[10217.18s -> 10220.86s]  Guys, I have to destroy the building and there's 10 people following me.
[10221.50s -> 10232.86s]  Running away makes you run into more guys. Yeah, so the two huge guys that were attacking me that
[10232.86s -> 10237.99s]  I couldn't kill. Just let them kill me on the bridge or try to fight for my goddamn life.
[10238.79s -> 10241.78s]  Should I just let them kill me on the bridge?
[10264.31s -> 10270.23s]  Can I buy something new? Yeah, I definitely can buy. I'm gonna get the health upgrade.
[10271.35s -> 10282.23s]  And also, it's kind of hard to tell what direction I'm even facing.
[10282.23s -> 10285.03s]  It's like, dude, why are you running away? I'm not even trying to. It's just
[10286.84s -> 10298.17s]  the game is flashing my life before my eyes. It's like if in Overwatch everybody's four moves
[10298.17s -> 10343.43s]  they had were all ultimates. Oh, itchy eye. Where's my tracer? Wait, did they make a tracer pop?
[10344.15s -> 10370.34s]  They did. But why don't I have one? Don't aggro anybody. All right, what's the... Oh my god.
[10370.34s -> 10375.75s]  I need to get like those dumb checkpoints too. I'm just gonna fly above the city.
[10376.97s -> 10380.65s]  I'm not gonna aggro anybody. I'm just gonna fly above. I'm gonna hide.
[10381.29s -> 10389.45s]  I'm gonna do sneaking from the top. So just sneak. Nobody will see me. See? No one's even
[10389.45s -> 10393.69s]  spawning. I'm breaking the game's spawn rate. Nothing can spawn up here because the game
[10394.25s -> 10398.97s]  prioritizes frame rate, right? So if it spawned a shitload of things right now, the game would break.
[10399.93s -> 10439.13s]  See? I land for a second and there's a guy right there. I don't know. Dead and dead. Okay, here we go.
[10439.93s -> 10449.80s]  And I just beat the shit out of these two guys. Should I race to the objective? Should I try to
[10449.80s -> 10478.30s]  spy cap this? All right, I'm gonna try. I'm gonna spy cap this mission. I land. Let's do it twice.
[10479.10s -> 10532.14s]  Do it again. It just fucking happened. Third one too. All right, let's help right there.
[10532.78s -> 10564.46s]  I might even have water in the game. God damn it. Don't aggro the other guy. I'm trying not to.
[10565.10s -> 10576.42s]  Are they smart enough? I'm gonna get the fuck... I'm gonna aggro the other guy, aren't I?
[10579.35s -> 10600.30s]  Do a move. Okay, stay back here. Just, I gotta be careful. Don't go the other way. Go the other way.
[10600.30s -> 10608.90s]  Watch this. Don't aggro anybody. Check this out. Oh, you fucking piece of shit. Give me a break.
[10609.70s -> 10635.51s]  It's gonna work. I got another guy here too. What the fuck? Does this guy even come from there?
[10635.51s -> 10642.23s]  What the fuck? There's no like, there's no strategy here. There's no fucking strategy.
[10652.84s -> 10667.16s]  It's just, it's just a mess. I have to buy the health upgrade. This is no way.
[10667.40s -> 10678.04s]  Unfortunately, we have to do that whole stupid goddamn mission again. But we'll have more health
[10678.04s -> 10700.66s]  when we do it. Well, I can assure you. Where is it? Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the health.
[10701.40s -> 10708.98s]  Double air dash. This is very fucking important too. Got that one. Okay, let's go. Just ignore
[10708.98s -> 10733.53s]  the bridge. Yeah, but I have to kill all the hulk busters. I have to kill the hulk. That's part of
[10734.49s -> 10756.68s]  the mission. Part of the mission is destroy all hulk busters. Dashing twice will probably help
[10756.68s -> 10795.00s]  a lot. The second one doesn't feel as powerful. Do I like this game? Yeah, I do. It's Caffa Faces.
[10795.56s -> 10799.72s]  No, I do. I do like this game. I do. Otherwise, I wouldn't be playing it two days in a row.
[10806.42s -> 10823.24s]  You're doing well, Bruce. Okay, let's try this again. More health. Get the jump checkpoint.
[10824.20s -> 10842.39s]  Oh, fuck. It's okay. Seven out of ten. Where's the jump point? Somebody spread it. All right.
[10842.39s -> 10847.69s]  Let's try this. I'm going for it. I'm going to try as hard as I can. All right. Quiet time.
[10848.41s -> 10907.16s]  Trying to be quiet. It's time to not talk about how much I hate this game. Okay. How the fuck are
[10907.16s -> 10925.14s]  these missing? Be aggressive. That's all you can do. I'm just spamming. I'm not like you. Well,
[10925.14s -> 10937.82s]  let me tactically think about this. I'm the Incredible Hulk. Let me play my chess. I'm
[10937.82s -> 10939.82s]  supposed to be quiet. I'm supposed to be quiet. I'm supposed to be quiet. I'm supposed to be
[10939.82s -> 10983.53s]  very quiet. Yeah, you walked right into it. Stupid. Here we go. Go. More aggressive. More
[10983.53s -> 10993.80s]  aggressive. Be more aggressive. I think the GameCube version had better frame rate.
[10997.30s -> 11003.30s]  It is? I have a feeling every game, every one of these had probably bad frame rate.
[11004.02s -> 11013.93s]  It's kind of hard to have a good frame rate when there's all this shit going on.
[11013.93s -> 11032.54s]  Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Fuck out of here. Let's go. It's because you're on 723.
[11032.54s -> 11042.55s]  Turn it down to 480i. I don't think I can handle that. I don't think I really could do that.
[11043.19s -> 11093.13s]  Pretend you're fighting Chad. Okay. Fuck you. Ow. Hey. Ouch. You're hurting me. Ouch. You're
[11093.13s -> 11119.99s]  hurting me. Ow. Ow. Stop. That hurt? Bits. Come on, Chad. Kick his ass. Come on. Let's go.
[11142.12s -> 11191.29s]  Get off me. Why do they keep spawning? Aggravating. Here we go. It's the first
[11191.29s -> 11216.31s]  hunk buster. Get down here. Ask and you shall receive, Jeremy. These guys are so hard to deal
[11216.31s -> 11223.70s]  with. Especially when there's all these other little shits just fucking spamming around you
[11224.02s -> 11239.85s]  in circles. Throw shit at them? Oh, I would love to. If it wasn't this shit just spamming
[11239.85s -> 11252.20s]  in every direction. You're fighting a raid boss. But I am a raid boss too. I can't use that.
[11266.84s -> 11270.04s]  They really liked the missiles. When they were making this game, they were like, you know what?
[11270.04s -> 11274.92s]  The missiles are the best part of the whole game. Just do more of those. More of those.
[11275.88s -> 11286.97s]  Excuse me, guys. I'm not seeing at least 50 missiles every one minute on screen.
[11287.37s -> 11308.54s]  What do you think this is? How are we supposed to determine if Hulk is powerful if he doesn't
[11308.54s -> 11314.54s]  get hit with fucking 100 long range missiles every second? People won't even know he's powerful.
[11314.54s -> 11345.69s]  They won't even know he's strong. He's mad. Here comes another one. Let's go. Hulk is stupid,
[11345.69s -> 11357.93s]  but he's strong. That's all right. He adds a lot to the Avengers. He added a shitload to
[11357.93s -> 11361.85s]  the Avengers. He was like, he was not even the strongest Avenger, but all right.
[11362.57s -> 11368.01s]  Not the smartest Avenger, but okay. Not the coolest powers of all the Avengers. Oh, all right.
[11369.05s -> 11399.16s]  It's green. All right. I'm ready for it. Let's go. Angry, angry, angry.
[11399.96s -> 11421.29s]  Go get me down. Did you grab me after the buzzer? That's a bunch of penalties. That's fine. Do it.
[11421.85s -> 11424.57s]  When the match is over, I will win because you're going to get a shitload of penalties.
[11424.57s -> 11429.86s]  You're going to get disqualified. Ref, I'm not doing anything. Ref, I'm not doing
[11429.86s -> 11450.22s]  shit. Thank you. All right. This is where I got left off before. This is important. This is the
[11450.22s -> 11467.93s]  one. This is the important mission. Just flatten me. These guys are really susceptible to the
[11467.93s -> 11478.49s]  fucking flattening. They really are. Just get a shield and then just hit Y and flatten. Over
[11478.49s -> 11498.89s]  and over again. Just got me. Yeah, but that just got me. How did you write that? If you write that,
[11498.89s -> 11514.97s]  that means I have to say it. What did you say that for? Did you take it out of my hands? What
[11515.13s -> 11538.10s]  has happened to that thing? Oh, shit. Oh, but that just got me. Folks, right now.
[11539.38s -> 11546.33s]  No, why are you doing this? We may need to do emergency surgery in the studio.
[11547.61s -> 11591.66s]  I don't want to do these things. Let me grab me. Thanks. All right. We're almost there. So the
[11591.66s -> 11598.22s]  strategy is to go across the water. No, there is no go across the water. There's no go across
[11598.78s -> 11603.42s]  guys. Look, destroy all Hulk busters. They have to die. They have to die.
[11603.42s -> 11627.58s]  I'm giving up free trailers. I just put that on my expenses and put that on my expenses.
[11627.58s -> 11632.70s]  I'll put that on my expenses. I'll put that on my expenses. I'll put that on my expenses.
[11643.72s -> 11664.07s]  All right. I can fucking take them to the ground. That went much cleaner. Here we go. Let's try this
[11664.07s -> 11686.02s]  tactic. No, wait, don't worry. This is an invisible wall. Staff are asking for a raise.
[11686.66s -> 11715.70s]  It's an invisible wall. Why wouldn't there be an invisible wall? Hi. Flat. Flat. Now we just have
[11715.70s -> 11731.80s]  to kill two huge guys at the same time. One of your staff just died. Guy just got destroyed. Good.
[11731.80s -> 11740.54s]  Okay. Here we go. I have to win. I've got to win. I've got to kill both these guys at the same time.
[11740.54s -> 11753.43s]  I've got two stomps. Don't waste critical mass. How should I be using it? Critical atomic slam.
[11754.15s -> 11777.59s]  Dan, do I have any other moves I can use it? That's the only move I can do with critical mass,
[11777.59s -> 11809.02s]  right? Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Fuck. I'm trying to grab.
[11809.74s -> 11830.39s]  Grab one at least. Grab one at least. Get him. It actually kind of is. How the fuck do you fight
[11830.39s -> 11872.62s]  these two guys at the same fucking time? Flat. That's not working. Flat don't work. Where the
[11872.62s -> 11886.84s]  fuck did you come from? Actually, I need you. Come here. I need his help. I need your help.
[11892.28s -> 11907.94s]  They flattened you. Yes, they do. I almost got one. One's almost done. One's dead. One's dead. I got
[11907.94s -> 11935.48s]  one. Why are you not dead? Don't jump. Xbox turn off. What are you trying to get? That's not going
[11935.48s -> 11964.47s]  to work. Xbox turn off. Xbox go to sleep. That was stupid. Elbow drops to the fucking wind. There
[11964.47s -> 11971.32s]  it is. All right. Dead. Finally. Oh my God. I'm just getting so mad. I'm just getting so angry.
[11971.32s -> 12007.46s]  I'm just so pissed off. Destroy the armory. All right. It's time for a critical mass. Wait,
[12007.46s -> 12010.98s]  let me do the punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch,
[12010.98s -> 12027.99s]  punch, punch, punch, punch. Is there any more to do? That was a long, horrible mission. I don't want
[12027.99s -> 12038.95s]  to do that one again. How can I say that again? Out of this video. Ultimate destruction. I don't
[12038.95s -> 12044.17s]  want to do that one again. I'm a freak show. Sometimes you got to do what's necessary.
[12044.73s -> 12052.38s]  Mutation doesn't have to be a curse. Yes. Yes. It can be a blessing if I choose it to be.
[12053.34s -> 12065.45s]  You're addicted to the power. You're becoming an abomination. What did you say? It's not like
[12065.45s -> 12072.25s]  that. I promise. Now I'm going to use that name. I'm not afraid of the mutation anymore.
[12072.25s -> 12083.74s]  This kind of power. Turned on his voice changer. He's streaming right now and people think it's
[12083.74s -> 12104.36s]  funny when he does the bugleberry. Is there a jump pod over here somewhere? There probably is.
[12104.76s -> 12120.63s]  Oh, we all know. We all know you can do very good. I need to probably jump here.
[12121.35s -> 12137.46s]  The next mission is the final mission. What is it actually? No, it's not.
[12139.34s -> 12162.17s]  We haven't even fought abomination. Where's a jump pod? I'm so sick of you fucking guys.
[12163.13s -> 12167.96s]  Follow me the fuck around everywhere I go.
[12167.96s -> 12181.02s]  Do you just leave me the fuck alone ever? Or do I have to constantly fucking constantly just be
[12181.66s -> 12190.87s]  running the fuck away from you? Just leave me alone. Why is the aggra range infinite on these
[12190.87s -> 12203.03s]  guys? It shouldn't be like that. Shouldn't be like that. Yeah. F, F, F, F. That was a real F.
[12203.99s -> 12224.49s]  Oh, that was a real one. Oh, it was a real one. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. No, don't worry. It's perfectly
[12224.49s -> 12231.13s]  normal. Perfectly normal. That's perfectly fine. That's completely normal. I'll tell you what.
[12232.33s -> 12237.53s]  That might be freaking out about 300. As you know, on a typical stream,
[12238.49s -> 12244.65s]  uh, a typical stream that's between four to seven, like five to six hours long,
[12245.29s -> 12249.45s]  drops about a thousand frames, maybe like 600 to a thousand. That's pretty typical.
[12249.45s -> 12252.81s]  But also keep this in mind as well. I'm also streaming through a VPN,
[12253.61s -> 12258.49s]  so I'm not getting the full power of the fiber because I'm going through a VPN.
[12259.69s -> 12268.38s]  Why am I doing that? Because I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm whack as I want to.
[12270.34s -> 12274.90s]  No, it is not the one. It's not that one. It's not that one. Okay. I can be, it's not that one.
[12277.58s -> 12290.86s]  I don't know what this is. I don't just want to die. What are you talking about? Well, uh,
[12290.86s -> 12300.33s]  don't act like I didn't buy a service and pay for the year four months ago or so and, uh, moved and
[12300.33s -> 12305.29s]  don't need it anymore. We don't think I'm going to get my money's worth and continue to use though,
[12305.37s -> 12309.61s]  that, that the, the privacy and the potential routing of a VPN provider.
[12310.33s -> 12328.94s]  I'm gonna let this thing run out. Critical thunderclap. I feel like, wait,
[12328.94s -> 12340.39s]  are there any important moves? Critical pain. It lives a huge deal of damage to a single foe.
[12341.59s -> 12355.08s]  Critical pain. What is it? Max X and then, hold on, how do you press that on Xbox with your
[12355.08s -> 12360.84s]  Max X plus B. I have to hold it like my thumb and finger. That's kind of a weird combo to press.
[12362.04s -> 12378.71s]  Anything else? I can't air spike. I'll think I saved the points.
[12381.22s -> 12395.98s]  Good for the big guys. Yeah. No, I, yeah, I'm still streaming through VPN. So I've lost literally
[12395.98s -> 12403.26s]  anything less than a thousand for a full stream is that's normal. Cause nothing can ever be
[12403.26s -> 12414.02s]  perfect. No matter how good or how fast or how stable something is in that back when there was
[12414.02s -> 12421.27s]  no internet problems at all. I mean, you typically will always drop like at least a few hundred frames
[12421.27s -> 12430.22s]  stream. That's not, I'm not, don't worry. I'm not alarmed by that. We're losing our few remaining
[12430.22s -> 12435.74s]  chances. Our contact in the division has left classified material for me in a box at the army
[12435.74s -> 12440.30s]  testing facility. I don't get it. Why they're praising like fiber was the second coming of
[12440.30s -> 12452.44s]  Christ. Well, yes, because, um, this fiber line is a 1000, 1000 line or 400% less than what I was
[12452.44s -> 12466.90s]  paying for a 330 line at the old place. So yeah, I am going to talk about it like that as cable sucks.
[12467.70s -> 12482.76s]  This is Len. I need you to listen to me. I can't protect you anymore. We've lost control.
[12482.76s -> 12487.80s]  Both of us. If you don't let me help you, you'll destroy yourself and the rest of us in the process.
[12487.80s -> 12491.80s]  Actually very, very true statement. I don't like what you're saying. I don't grow a car.
[12495.50s -> 12502.44s]  Oh, it's bad. Looks like worse than a super villain. Okay. How many people has the Joker killed?
[12502.44s -> 12511.34s]  Oh, like what? Like less than 20 just today. The Hulk has killed like 5,000 fucking people.
[12512.06s -> 12522.15s]  I'm talking only today. All right. This is the frame rate boss.
[12532.60s -> 12566.31s]  Grab him. I got to get like up on his head. Grab him. The army's doing damage. Yeah, I know.
[12571.64s -> 12587.10s]  Oh, I think I lose. I need to retry this one. I'm going to be here for a long time.
[12587.82s -> 12609.13s]  I'm going to be here for a very, very long time. What did he say? What? What did he say?
[12610.17s -> 12614.10s]  What did he just say? What do you mean? I wasn't even paying attention.
[12615.06s -> 12624.09s]  He said mop up. I'm done here. Right? Like I'm done. What are you talking about? Hold on.
[12624.73s -> 12662.38s]  Let me hear that again. What do you, what do you, when the Hulk is confined by a special attack,
[12662.38s -> 12670.68s]  he can struggle. Yes. Okay. All right. Kill me. I want to hear what you guys are talking about.
[12718.68s -> 12727.22s]  Come and mop up. Now I'm not going to be able to unhear that for the next 30 times I die to this
[12727.22s -> 12757.19s]  guy. All right. Stupid. All right. Launch a missile. Incoming missile. That's not a missile. I want
[12757.19s -> 12765.29s]  you to do a missile. Doink. Tell me again to grab missiles and throw them back. I'd love to hear
[12765.29s -> 12769.45s]  you tell me about it. Tell me. Yell at me. You should be grabbing missiles. Grab the missile.
[12771.61s -> 12829.06s]  You got one. Where's that tank? Where are you? Wait. I died. This is going to be hard. It's not
[12829.06s -> 12835.70s]  that. It's come, it's coming mop up boys. Coming mop up boys. Coming mop up boys.
[12836.34s -> 12844.34s]  Yeah. Coming mop up boys. Coming mop up boys. Coming mop up boys. See it's coming mop up boys.
[12845.30s -> 12868.18s]  It's that's what he's saying. That's what he's saying. Why would I do that? I was trying to like
[12868.18s -> 12873.62s]  prove to you guys. What am I proving to you? You already know what it is. This guy's impossible.
[12874.58s -> 12911.11s]  Can I just do an elbow drop? Can I just run? Run. Oh it fell. I don't even know what the strategy is.
[12912.39s -> 12922.70s]  What am I talking about? There is no strategy. I have to take down four, five health bars with this.
[12923.26s -> 12961.19s]  Grab his foot. Tanks at him. Yeah but I have to stand still for the tanks and I'm gonna get hit
[12961.19s -> 13014.66s]  by everything. Like I'm, I'm already dead. I'm gonna try to throw tanks at him. Or is there a tank?
[13018.66s -> 13029.77s]  Can I just get a shield for the time being until a tank shows up? I mean what are you doing?
[13031.21s -> 13045.94s]  Okay here comes some tanks. All right let's go. I'm gonna grab one. See this is what I'm talking
[13045.94s -> 13056.84s]  about. Me throwing this tank I'm getting just killed. Did we throw it? Holy shit that was a lot
[13056.84s -> 13109.69s]  of damage. But I need you over here. Come here. No get this out of here. Attack him. Him.
[13122.46s -> 13129.58s]  Junior. Are you watching the movie with your dad? Like he's really hyperactive right now.
[13131.42s -> 13137.18s]  Dad's just fucking sick of his shit. Junior sit down. I'm trying to fucking enjoy the Hulk. Ultimate
[13137.18s -> 13163.59s]  fucking missiles on screen. That mist. Dad's reading a newspaper. Dad's not even watching
[13163.59s -> 13169.74s]  the movie. He just doesn't want uh little Timmy to be jumping around excited about the Hulk.
[13169.74s -> 13187.66s]  God. Okay I got the right strategy but I have to stay alive. Yeah I I ain't gonna show that on
[13187.66s -> 13196.60s]  screen. Uh I'm not gonna put that image on screen. But you are free to um to look at it on your own
[13196.60s -> 13202.12s]  time if you feel like it. You can do that if you feel like it. You can just on your own time. You
[13202.12s -> 13206.12s]  can look at whatever image you want as long as. It's nothing to do with me. Literally nothing to do
[13206.12s -> 13229.83s]  with me. Has nothing to do with me. I'm just gonna get away. Yes I do. Just run. No dad.
[13246.82s -> 13256.73s]  There's the first tank. Oh nervous. I used that one already today. I used that one already. Oh
[13256.73s -> 13261.13s]  nervous. Oh scared and oh I tried to. I already did that one today.
[13261.85s -> 13282.31s]  I'm gonna do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.
[13282.31s -> 13286.95s]  Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.
[13286.95s -> 13333.90s]  Look at what I was doing. What's this bullshit? Tank. Tank. Land so I can punch you. Okay we're
[13333.90s -> 13351.51s]  doing good. I'm gonna heal. Pick up the heal globe. Run. Heal. I wish I could see.
[13352.47s -> 13381.03s]  Destroy this whole entire place. Safe going up. There he is. Wait the energy meet me.
[13382.39s -> 13420.65s]  All right let's get him. Here is another tank. And shut up. Oh banner. Banner what the heck man.
[13433.29s -> 13470.54s]  Do it. Oh she's alive. Oh I need a tank. I need a tank right now. Right now. Come here.
[13471.26s -> 13475.67s]  That's it.
[13502.18s -> 13508.87s]  You spray paint your hair green to mock me.
[13532.54s -> 13545.75s]  Oh no. Is it hypnotism word? That's all we had to do. Can I buy anything?

[13633.72s -> 13643.85s]  vault defenses and leap to freedom. All right. You can't just open his mind. It's like trying
[13643.85s -> 13650.58s]  to peel an onion with a chainsaw. You promised me he'd have the best of care. I said to the
[13650.58s -> 13656.34s]  best of my ability. It's out of my hands now. Wait I've been in VR this whole time haven't I?
[13656.34s -> 13663.18s]  Oh you can't just open his mind.
[13689.51s -> 13694.15s]  Tough you are to the nearest decimal point. I don't need to know how to become
[13694.15s -> 13706.50s]  like you. I need to know how to control it. Voice what are you? I'm Ahab. I know you get angry. It
[13706.50s -> 13712.42s]  makes you big green. We'll make sure we have so many protocols in place to prevent you from doing

[13840.54s -> 13852.87s]  Text bloodbath 426442. Hey by the way how the fuck does that even work?
[13853.67s -> 13858.95s]  When you text like the five digits. I don't understand. It's not a phone number. I don't get it.
[13859.83s -> 13873.30s]  It doesn't make any sense. They don't do that anymore. Yeah remember it was like if you want
[13873.30s -> 13880.50s]  the funny cat wallpaper text funny wallpaper to like whatever number number number number right

[13909.45s -> 13911.77s]  Whatever number number number number don't say numbers.
[13912.33s -> 13936.25s]  I need to burn away for a second. Hail him. I'm gonna play numbers go up.
[13936.89s -> 13953.11s]  I'm not what do you mean? Play numbers go up. We're good. We should play stock market simulator.
[13953.75s -> 13961.53s]  Is that a real game? Is that a real game? Is that a real game? Is that a real game? Does it follow

[14136.86s -> 14138.86s]  Nobody even did a move there.
[14138.86s -> 14140.86s]  We were both trying to throw at the same time.
[14140.86s -> 14142.86s]  We both have money on ourselves losing.
[14142.86s -> 14160.78s]  We both have money on ourselves losing.
[14160.78s -> 14165.88s]  For a Jerma Rumble?
[14165.88s -> 14168.89s]  Hmm. That's a thought.
[14168.89s -> 14170.89s]  Yeah, it's just a big green guy.
[14170.89s -> 14172.89s]  We take very much development.
[14172.89s -> 14198.66s]  Quack quack quack quack quack quack.
[14198.66s -> 14200.66s]  What do we call ourselves? The Jerma Crew?
[14200.66s -> 14229.14s]  Yeah.
[14229.14s -> 14231.14s]  Sure.
[14231.14s -> 14233.38s]  Whatever you say, game.
[14233.38s -> 14238.44s]  No, just glue your hand to my head and kill me?
[14238.44s -> 14240.44s]  No, just glue your hand to my head and kill me?
[14240.44s -> 14244.02s]  Oh, did you have to do it?
[14244.02s -> 14250.66s]  Oh, okay.
[14250.66s -> 14270.70s]  Fuck.
[14270.70s -> 14277.99s]  We have to fight in this little fucking corridor.
[14277.99s -> 14279.99s]  We have to fight in this little fucking corridor.
[14279.99s -> 14281.99s]  No, now you can't get in here, the gate's closed.
[14281.99s -> 14285.70s]  Fuck off.
[14285.70s -> 14307.13s]  Now I fight the huge guy.
[14307.13s -> 14309.13s]  I need to throw explosives at him.
[14309.13s -> 14311.13s]  Don't let him blow these barrels up, they're very important.
[14311.13s -> 14329.18s]  Just throw fucking, just throw dice in the air.
[14329.18s -> 14331.18s]  Just throw fucking, just throw dice in the air.
[14331.18s -> 14333.18s]  Whatever lands.
[14333.18s -> 14343.16s]  That's what happens.
[14343.16s -> 14369.40s]  D&D Hulk.
[14369.40s -> 14378.55s]  I grabbed one.
[14378.55s -> 14381.24s]  He's sure he's not pretending.
[14381.24s -> 14383.24s]  I'm pretty sure he is.
[14383.24s -> 14412.22s]  He has to be.
[14412.22s -> 14414.22s]  And he grabbed me during that
[14414.22s -> 14425.61s]  attack and stopped running and throwing.
[14425.61s -> 14427.61s]  But I'm gonna get grabbed and half my health disappears.
[14427.61s -> 14429.61s]  Every enemy in the game has a
[14429.61s -> 14443.69s]  You can't just open his
[14443.69s -> 14445.86s]  Get away from me, you pile of filth.
[14445.86s -> 14447.86s]  Just swing.
[14447.86s -> 14449.86s]  What happened in this room?
[14449.86s -> 14452.10s]  Did he leave a grenade?
[14452.10s -> 14454.66s]  Get away from me, you pile of filth.
[14454.66s -> 14456.66s]  Sorry everyone I know in there.
[14456.66s -> 14458.66s]  I dropped the grenade and ran out of the fucking room.
[14458.66s -> 14460.66s]  I dropped the grenade and ran out of the fucking room.
[14460.66s -> 14462.66s]  Speaking of running out of rooms, I'm just running.
[14462.66s -> 14466.57s]  Speaking of running out of rooms, I'm just running.
[14466.57s -> 14468.57s]  Why even play the video game?
[14468.57s -> 14503.69s]  Alright, shut it on him.
[14503.69s -> 14505.69s]  Use new moves and what?
[14505.69s -> 14507.69s]  You see the fucking insanity
[14507.69s -> 14509.69s]  You see the fucking insanity that's going on on the screen?
[14509.69s -> 14513.02s]  that's going on on the screen?
[14513.02s -> 14515.02s]  X, Y, and then Y, Y, X.
[14515.02s -> 14524.30s]  This is not that hard.
[14524.30s -> 14534.54s]  I don't have any clubs. I don't have any club moves.
[14534.54s -> 14542.79s]  X and Y?
[14542.79s -> 14548.04s]  Let's try that.
[14548.04s -> 14550.04s]  Punch the missiles back? No, we've already shown how ineffective that actually is.
[14550.04s -> 14552.04s]  Punch the missiles back? No, we've already shown how ineffective that actually is.
[14552.04s -> 14584.04s]  Get me out of here!
[14584.04s -> 14603.69s]  Why can't I just climb out?
[14603.69s -> 14605.69s]  Look at us.
[14605.69s -> 14613.05s]  What?
[14613.05s -> 14615.05s]  Alright, cool, yeah.
[14615.05s -> 14617.05s]  I don't know.
[14617.05s -> 14619.22s]  Pogs are
[14619.22s -> 14621.22s]  Pogs are for dumb idiots.
[14621.22s -> 14630.57s]  Pogs are for
[14630.57s -> 14633.83s]  Pogs are for your breath smells, I bet.
[14633.83s -> 14651.11s]  Pogs are for your breath smells, I bet.
[14651.11s -> 14653.11s]  Dude, just X, X, Y, Y,
[14653.11s -> 14655.11s]  Dude, just X, X, Y, Y, man. Like Y, Y, X, X.
[14655.11s -> 14657.11s]  Dude, just X, X, Y, Y, man. Like Y, Y, X, X. Do you combo on these?
[14657.11s -> 14661.02s]  X, X, why are you not doing a combo?
[14661.02s -> 14667.10s]  Why, why?
[14667.10s -> 14693.66s]  It's just a game?
[14693.66s -> 14695.66s]  No, it's the lifestyle.
[14695.66s -> 14706.52s]  I am the fucking Hulk.
[14706.52s -> 14708.52s]  Don't you understand?
[14708.52s -> 14718.38s]  I can't even attack him.
[14718.38s -> 14720.94s]  I just have to throw shit at him.
[14720.94s -> 14722.94s]  I can't physically fucking swing at him.
[14722.94s -> 14727.54s]  I just have to throw shit at him. I can't physically fucking swing at him.
[14727.54s -> 14762.98s]  Damn it!
[14762.98s -> 14779.99s]  Crusted, I needed that.
[14779.99s -> 14781.99s]  Crusted, I needed that.
[14781.99s -> 14783.99s]  I just goomba stomped that I needed that so bad.
[14783.99s -> 14785.99s]  I just goomba stomped that I needed that so bad.
[14785.99s -> 14788.36s]  What happened?
[14788.36s -> 14799.56s]  Alright, throw a broken car at him.
[14799.56s -> 14801.99s]  Just do your combo.
[14801.99s -> 14803.99s]  X, X, Y, Y.
[14803.99s -> 14822.94s]  This motherfucker just tripped.
[14822.94s -> 14827.74s]  I need a...
[14827.74s -> 14829.74s]  Fucking broken down, broke ass car.
[14829.74s -> 14834.15s]  Just hit him.
[14834.15s -> 14836.15s]  I can't, you can't just punch him.
[14836.15s -> 14838.90s]  Eat this shit.
[14838.90s -> 14841.14s]  I hit the fucking dumb asshole in front of him.
[14841.14s -> 14871.54s]  Is he dead?
[14871.54s -> 14874.42s]  Just get the fuck away from me.
[14874.42s -> 14880.18s]  Just get the fuck away from me.
[14880.18s -> 14882.18s]  This is what it feels like to be a bug in a room full of people.
[14882.18s -> 14891.02s]  Where's that mosquito?
[14891.02s -> 14893.51s]  There he is, there he is, get him, get him.
[14893.51s -> 14896.20s]  Please don't get me.
[14896.20s -> 14898.20s]  No, open up a window, let me fly out.
[14898.20s -> 14909.85s]  I promise I'll fly out if you just open a fucking window.
[14909.85s -> 14911.85s]  Fucking chance, stupid human.
[14911.85s -> 14913.85s]  Oh, he killed me.
[14913.85s -> 14915.85s]  What was that grab?
[14915.85s -> 14919.11s]  No, guys, guys, no.
[14919.11s -> 14921.11s]  No, I'm sorry.
[14921.11s -> 14923.11s]  I ain't gonna fucking take the blame on this one.
[14923.11s -> 14925.11s]  I ain't taking the blame on this one.
[14925.11s -> 14927.11s]  I'm not taking the blame on this.
[14927.11s -> 14929.80s]  It's like I'm not locked on.
[14929.80s -> 14931.80s]  And who is even attacking who?
[14936.02s -> 14938.02s]  This is, no way.
[14938.02s -> 14940.02s]  You can't even fucking determine.
[14940.02s -> 14947.90s]  Like I said, alright, give me
[14947.90s -> 14977.98s]  some life.
[14977.98s -> 14986.30s]  I did it.
[14986.30s -> 14995.06s]  I did it.
[14995.06s -> 15007.42s]  I just want to see if there were a bunch of people behind
[15007.42s -> 15009.42s]  that door. Oh, no, there's somebody.
[15009.42s -> 15011.42s]  You're coming with me.
[15011.42s -> 15030.74s]  Oh, shit.
[15030.74s -> 15034.52s]  Oh, he found me. He found me.
[15034.52s -> 15052.38s]  He found me.
[15052.38s -> 15054.38s]  Banner, I have the stormtroopers behind you.
[15054.38s -> 15058.02s]  I guess still floating.
[15058.02s -> 15060.02s]  Wait, the guy's floating in the
[15060.02s -> 15072.70s]  jump pad.
[15072.70s -> 15075.19s]  That's kind of a cool move.
[15075.19s -> 15080.06s]  Get explosions on you.
[15080.06s -> 15087.93s]  Escape the vault. Oh, God.
[15087.93s -> 15089.93s]  Escape vault. Escape inner base.
[15089.93s -> 15091.93s]  Escape outer base. Return to the
[15091.93s -> 15093.93s]  church. Great.
[15093.93s -> 15104.62s]  This is gonna be hell.
[15104.62s -> 15114.47s]  Oh, they're
[15114.47s -> 15120.17s]  seriously blocking
[15120.17s -> 15122.17s]  doors.
[15122.17s -> 15126.58s]  Do I have to actually kill everything?
[15126.58s -> 15128.58s]  Alright, where's the tank?
[15128.58s -> 15154.74s]  Where the fuck did they come from?
[15154.74s -> 15156.74s]  Where did all these tanks come from?
[15156.74s -> 15161.61s]  Where did they come from?
[15161.61s -> 15170.31s]  Where are you guys being here?
[15170.31s -> 15173.58s]  Oh, they're coming out of the doors.
[15173.58s -> 15175.58s]  Stand at the door and don't let them come out.
[15175.58s -> 15181.78s]  Can I leave yet?
[15181.78s -> 15185.24s]  Wait, just leave?
[15185.24s -> 15187.24s]  Wait, this is not a force field?
[15187.24s -> 15189.24s]  I can't leave.
[15189.24s -> 15191.24s]  Guys, this is like a force field doing this.
[15191.24s -> 15193.24s]  I can't get out of here. I have to kill everything.
[15193.24s -> 15207.05s]  Can I finally do bowling?
[15207.05s -> 15227.72s]  Yeah, I'm Hulk.
[15227.72s -> 15233.48s]  This is like just Hulk
[15233.48s -> 15239.82s]  bored. Let it go.
[15239.82s -> 15242.89s]  Oh, they're killing each other.
[15242.89s -> 15244.89s]  They're just singing
[15244.89s -> 15246.89s]  in the rain.
[15246.89s -> 15249.06s]  Singing in the rain.
[15249.06s -> 15251.06s]  What a day
[15251.06s -> 15253.06s]  to be around.
[15253.06s -> 15256.26s]  Now fucking die.
[15256.26s -> 15263.18s]  Can I get rid of this?
[15263.18s -> 15266.95s]  Just throw it.
[15266.95s -> 15268.95s]  I don't want this.
[15268.95s -> 15280.84s]  Wait, come here.
[15280.84s -> 15282.84s]  Somebody said throw it through the shield.
[15282.84s -> 15285.02s]  Oh my
[15285.02s -> 15287.02s]  God. What?
[15287.02s -> 15289.02s]  What?
[15289.02s -> 15292.98s]  What the heck?
[15292.98s -> 15294.98s]  I can't walk through the shield,
[15294.98s -> 15296.98s]  but I can throw things through the shield.
[15296.98s -> 15298.98s]  What object am I made out of?
[15298.98s -> 15301.99s]  What is this? A water filter?
[15301.99s -> 15303.99s]  And I'm like the
[15303.99s -> 15305.99s]  thing. This is like the fucking dirt
[15305.99s -> 15307.99s]  that can get through the filter, but not me.
[15307.99s -> 15320.39s]  This is like a...
[15320.39s -> 15322.39s]  I taught you that yesterday. It's been a whole day, man.
[15322.39s -> 15334.87s]  I think I got it.
[15334.87s -> 15339.29s]  Hey, you. Later.
[15339.29s -> 15352.73s]  Are you drunk?
[15352.73s -> 15356.12s]  No, I'm not.
[15356.12s -> 15358.12s]  I am actually not. Sorry to say.
[15358.12s -> 15361.38s]  Although I really
[15361.38s -> 15363.38s]  probably should have a drink.
[15363.38s -> 15365.38s]  Maybe like a
[15365.38s -> 15369.22s]  few days.
[15369.22s -> 15371.22s]  Watch some public domain movies.
[15371.22s -> 15373.72s]  Wednesday.
[15373.72s -> 15376.02s]  Double hit.
[15376.02s -> 15384.34s]  Where's this other one?
[15384.34s -> 15392.22s]  Out of the tower. One more.
[15392.22s -> 15401.24s]  Turn, Hulk. Turn.
[15401.24s -> 15403.24s]  Here's to that. Thanks for
[15403.24s -> 15405.24s]  blowing my shit up.
[15405.24s -> 15407.24s]  Now I can't break it. I need this other one.
[15407.24s -> 15409.24s]  I really cannot hit this.
[15409.24s -> 15421.06s]  Get up there.
[15421.06s -> 15423.06s]  Don't shoot this out of my hands.
[15423.06s -> 15425.06s]  I'll be so mad at you.
[15425.06s -> 15442.78s]  Go. Thank you.
[15442.78s -> 15451.91s]  Try another.
[15451.91s -> 15453.91s]  Oh, you missed that one.
[15453.91s -> 15472.01s]  Drive by the jets.
[15472.01s -> 15481.99s]  I want to ride one.
[15481.99s -> 15484.30s]  That's not how a plane works.
[15484.30s -> 15486.30s]  That's not how planes work.
[15486.30s -> 15488.30s]  This is not...
[15488.30s -> 15492.17s]  They fucking
[15492.17s -> 15494.17s]  It's not
[15494.17s -> 15496.73s]  like a little kid
[15496.73s -> 15498.73s]  putting a little kid in
[15498.73s -> 15500.73s]  this fucking bedroom.
[15500.73s -> 15502.73s]  Plane flies around like this.
[15504.73s -> 15510.55s]  Why is there not a toddler's
[15510.55s -> 15512.55s]  hand on that? Why?
[15512.55s -> 15529.06s]  I need to grab this.
[15529.06s -> 15534.70s]  How do I jump over it?
[15556.82s -> 15561.05s]  Banner.
[15561.05s -> 15564.62s]  Banner. Don't do it
[15564.62s -> 15566.62s]  Banner. Banner.
[15566.62s -> 15592.78s]  Object.
[15592.78s -> 15594.78s]  You're making me fucking
[15594.78s -> 15619.22s]  bald.
[15619.22s -> 15621.22s]  Why would you turn that way?
[15621.22s -> 15623.22s]  I'm trying to aim down here.
[15623.22s -> 15625.22s]  That's so...
[15625.22s -> 15629.19s]  Aim the other
[15629.19s -> 15633.74s]  fucking way.
[15633.74s -> 15635.74s]  What are you doing?
[15635.74s -> 15648.34s]  Of course, here comes a toddler plane.
[15648.34s -> 15681.88s]  Can't wait.
[15681.88s -> 15685.08s]  This really is fucking
[15685.08s -> 15687.08s]  dumb as shit.
[15687.08s -> 15708.70s]  I need to jump over
[15708.70s -> 15717.91s]  the tunnel.
[15717.91s -> 15719.91s]  Let's aim.
[15719.91s -> 15721.91s]  Yes.
[15721.91s -> 15723.91s]  Yes.
[15723.91s -> 15725.91s]  You know all the people that I'm facing?
[15725.91s -> 15727.91s]  You know the people that I'm
[15727.91s -> 15729.91s]  directly facing with my character?
[15729.91s -> 15732.54s]  Target them. Definitely do that.
[15732.54s -> 15734.54s]  Target the people that are behind you.
[15734.54s -> 15736.54s]  This is fun.
[15736.54s -> 15778.18s]  Didn't even work.
[15778.18s -> 15781.26s]  Fire a missile in here.
[15781.26s -> 15784.07s]  Don't come in here.
[15784.07s -> 15786.07s]  All right.
[15786.07s -> 15788.07s]  They did.
[15788.07s -> 15791.21s]  I want that
[15791.21s -> 15793.21s]  targeted, please.
[15793.21s -> 15795.21s]  The thing in front of me.
[15795.21s -> 15797.21s]  The thing in front of me.
[15797.21s -> 15799.21s]  Ultimate Destruction. The thing in front of me.
[15799.21s -> 15801.21s]  It's right in front of you.
[15801.21s -> 15803.21s]  It's right here.
[15803.21s -> 15825.93s]  Oh my god.
[15825.93s -> 15827.93s]  It's a fucking ceiling.
[15827.93s -> 15829.93s]  There's a bunch of junk in the way.
[15829.93s -> 15834.22s]  Shoot at me.
[15834.22s -> 15842.97s]  I dare you.
[15842.97s -> 15845.91s]  What is above me?
[15845.91s -> 15879.82s]  Is it a toddler plane?
[15879.82s -> 15890.25s]  Goodbye. Pick up the truck.
[15890.25s -> 15892.42s]  And attack.
[15892.42s -> 15897.61s]  Three. Two.
[15897.61s -> 15899.61s]  One. Go.
[15902.87s -> 15915.74s]  Where is this tower thing?
[15915.74s -> 15923.54s]  Break the target.
[15927.00s -> 15938.14s]  I don't like gravity.
[15938.14s -> 15940.95s]  I don't like gravity.
[15940.95s -> 15943.38s]  I don't like gravity.
[15943.38s -> 15945.38s]  Movie too long. Too boring.
[15945.38s -> 15961.75s]  Give me this.
[15961.75s -> 15969.62s]  No. Stop.
[15969.62s -> 15971.62s]  He stopped.
[15971.62s -> 15974.38s]  He listened.
[15974.38s -> 15977.00s]  Freeze.
[15977.00s -> 15994.78s]  Return to the church.
[15994.78s -> 15996.78s]  Just do your combo, man.
[15996.78s -> 15998.78s]  Express x, x, y, y, y.
[15998.78s -> 16006.95s]  Okay.
[16025.35s -> 16027.35s]  I don't rage.
[16027.35s -> 16031.83s]  Kindergarten.
[16031.83s -> 16034.44s]  Yeah.
[16034.44s -> 16037.06s]  I don't like that.
[16051.40s -> 16053.40s]  Aww.
[16053.40s -> 16058.84s]  To the devil his due.
[16058.84s -> 16062.30s]  After this cutscene I'm going to go take a break.
[16062.30s -> 16064.30s]  I'm going to get a water and I'm going to take a small pee.
[16080.30s -> 16082.30s]  The devil hulk's going to emerge and there's nothing I can do about it.
[16082.30s -> 16084.30s]  I'm sorry.
[16084.30s -> 16086.30s]  I'm sorry I gave up on you.
[16086.30s -> 16088.30s]  Don't you just want to make the devil mad?
[16088.30s -> 16090.30s]  I'm a liar and an idiot.
[16090.30s -> 16092.30s]  I'm Jerma.
[16092.30s -> 16095.88s]  And a thief.
[16095.88s -> 16097.88s]  This is the regulator axis.
[16097.88s -> 16099.88s]  Where did you get this?
[16099.88s -> 16101.88s]  Let's just say it fell off the back of an army general.
[16101.88s -> 16103.88s]  You know.
[16103.88s -> 16112.33s]  Just in case I had to go to a Plan C.
[16112.33s -> 16119.37s]  Apology accepted.
[16119.37s -> 16121.37s]  New moves are available.
[16121.37s -> 16129.07s]  Bonski files to be unread do this first
[16139.19s -> 16141.09s]  Can I just go up
[16141.09s -> 16162.01s]  No, our surge level three important double super air-dash air cannonball though
[16162.89s -> 16199.21s]  Game a grinder. What is that? Oh and chain was get it. I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some
[16200.21s -> 16202.89s]  Water and take a small pee. I'll be right back
[16203.65s -> 16450.61s]  start
[16450.61s -> 16452.61s]  four and a half hours ago
[16460.60s -> 16463.64s]  Bad joke what long pee I got a water, too. I
[16464.68s -> 16468.81s]  was next
[16468.81s -> 16479.48s]  Me this is called meme dot PNG. Oh
[16481.32s -> 16508.30s]  Going that one either strange cargo. I want that better dash
[16509.10s -> 16512.55s]  Is it a hundred something thousand?
[16513.03s -> 16515.42s]  Something like that
[16515.42s -> 16516.88s]  150,000
[16516.88s -> 16523.56s]  How far away is this? Oh, that's so whatever could have just done this jump pod
[16524.22s -> 16542.53s]  No, not Murius
[16542.53s -> 16551.63s]  We have very little time if Ross and his men realize I've stolen the regulator access
[16551.63s -> 16557.75s]  They'll move to relocate the other half. We can't control power to the machine without it. That's why I'm sending you back out there
[16557.75s -> 16561.85s]  I know it's a risk because of this emergent devil. Hope we had no choice
[16562.15s -> 16565.03s]  What they're going to be on you like ants on a free meal
[16565.23s -> 16569.03s]  Make sure the regulator stays safe because this is our last change
[16569.03s -> 16575.47s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I have to go and retrieve and bring shit back to the church
[16575.51s -> 16586.14s]  Is there any other missions in the game besides get item and put items into item box back at church?
[16587.38s -> 16597.66s]  Apparently they're right here
[16599.18s -> 16613.14s]  Sorry, I get hurt by that
[16624.79s -> 16637.14s]  Lot of you here
[16639.10s -> 16645.38s]  Yeah, so I didn't want to pick you up
[16648.70s -> 16650.18s]  targeting with this
[16650.18s -> 16668.48s]  So this is where we run and we pick up and run pick up run pick up run and that's it
[16668.52s -> 16678.58s]  We don't do anything else. How would practicing my moves help when there's ten people doing moves around me?
[16679.30s -> 16682.06s]  like if I
[16683.06s -> 16690.96s]  I'm just gonna grab it and run you see how close the helicopter was
[16691.52s -> 16709.05s]  I'm just gonna do this. I even fight any of these things
[16709.57s -> 16721.46s]  Wait, did I not get it? Wait, hold on. There was it what it was. It was an inside. It was inside that truck
[16721.82s -> 16762.46s]  Let's wait for the heel bring truck to the military base. Oh
[16763.06s -> 16774.26s]  not the church I
[16774.30s -> 16798.82s]  Can't jump with the truck. So I have to just walk what's just left in this game. It can't be much more
[16799.10s -> 16803.50s]  Right. I took back the fucking secret serum, right? That means that's that where at the end of the game
[16804.22s -> 16819.40s]  Two missions. All right. Well, let's go
[16819.92s -> 16867.04s]  All right, I brought the truck weapon eyes. What what the hell are you doing? I jump. No, there is no jumping
[16867.04s -> 16871.32s]  I mean, this is is this count as plus one letter grade. I mean sure I guess I think it does
[16871.80s -> 16876.31s]  I'm Fred Flint stoning this car, but I am driving the car
[16893.32s -> 16896.76s]  It's just a car coming through, you know, there's no cars drive
[16897.40s -> 16910.24s]  Somebody's got run over wait. I can stop this. He'll see through my what did he hurt? What happened? What is this?
[16910.50s -> 16937.35s]  This is free. Wait, do I have to get it checked? How does this work? Hold on there?
[16937.35s -> 16976.29s]  Are they gonna pat the car down? Yeah, I can't go faster than this
[16976.89s -> 16980.89s]  Why wouldn't I punch through the front and drive the car?
[16980.93s -> 16988.56s]  You know punt my pull my feet up tuck my feet up punch through the front of the bed here and grab the wheel
[16988.64s -> 16995.29s]  I just drive what does this achieve? I can still wear the car but be driving it
[16998.97s -> 17001.57s]  Hope just drive the car. Why do I have to walk with it? Oh
[17011.06s -> 17013.06s]  Retrieve the cube now
[17032.98s -> 17037.26s]  Wrong thing
[17037.42s -> 17043.38s]  Yes, you're the cube
[17064.49s -> 17066.97s]  Football that was American football
[17068.95s -> 17070.95s]  this is American football, but the
[17071.59s -> 17074.57s]  The ball has greased up with oil. Oh
[17075.60s -> 17078.36s]  This sucks. I have to do that whole thing again
[17078.96s -> 17089.55s]  Holy shit. This is horrible. I have to walk the car again
[17090.15s -> 17116.70s]  There has to be a faster way to do that. There was no there is not a faster way to do this
[17117.56s -> 17120.75s]  Like yeah Patriots must be yeah, this is nice
[17121.39s -> 17143.60s]  Good guy
[17143.60s -> 17158.19s]  Did I die did it hit me? I think I'm good
[17158.27s -> 17167.74s]  No, that was nothing wrong
[17167.74s -> 17180.14s]  That was the right warp because I'm gonna despawn all those enemies come back ain't gonna be any enemies there at all
[17180.50s -> 17183.06s]  Rock will be right there and I can walk the truck back in
[17183.58s -> 17192.35s]  Well, these are all funny images you good
[17196.30s -> 17210.02s]  Was that just that wrong warped down there? Wait, what?
[17213.52s -> 17217.68s]  Okay, wait for a second. I thought that
[17217.72s -> 17232.10s]  Good run this back at full health
[17232.50s -> 17238.09s]  How do I have fuck all health of being so close to the end of the game?
[17238.09s -> 17245.71s]  It's only one more health upgrade. I have the first two. There's like three. I think what you're describing is
[17246.83s -> 17253.35s]  It's a decision that the developers made when they made this game. I can't Hulk have like 10,000 more HP
[17254.07s -> 17264.43s]  You know, maybe band length. I'll just turn them off
[17264.47s -> 17271.43s]  Hey, you know each of my lesson turn links off. Just disable links. You know, I'll teach him a lesson
[17272.11s -> 17282.93s]  All right out time to teach him a lesson
[17283.53s -> 17292.22s]  All right. All right
[17292.22s -> 17299.72s]  Mods if people's if people do a link in chat, I'm them up 10 minutes. Got it. That's gonna happen
[17300.32s -> 17307.01s]  That's gonna happen to you. I've just made the order. I just gave the order. It's gonna happen. I the order has been placed
[17307.57s -> 17313.75s]  It's gonna happen. If this if you do purple text with a link
[17314.29s -> 17347.04s]  You're out of here. Ten minutes. That's it purge purge them. Oh you guys are getting fucking destroyed
[17347.76s -> 17352.46s]  Tell you I'm a man of my word 40% of the time. This is one of those times. I
[17361.60s -> 17366.48s]  See you did there. You try to get a nightbot band trying to get a nightbot timed out nightbot has immunity
[17367.04s -> 17382.99s]  Why would I time out nightbot? He controls everything here. I
[17387.20s -> 17392.04s]  Tell it and slowly slowly the links begin to cease
[17392.76s -> 17396.34s]  Ten the ten minute timeout
[17397.02s -> 17404.92s]  It's got them all fucked up. Okay. Let's go
[17411.41s -> 17430.06s]  Hurry go. Where am I going? This is not even the right fucking way to go. It's only one exit. Oh
[17445.94s -> 17449.46s]  shit
[17470.56s -> 17476.77s]  You didn't just do that
[17477.57s -> 17498.44s]  Give me that. Give me them. Give me them. Give me them. They have so many things
[17499.64s -> 17501.64s]  So many things
[17505.51s -> 17508.75s]  Come on Bruce, come on deliver it into the end zone. Oh
[17509.75s -> 17531.93s]  That's done. I did it. I have to get another one. Okay. Here's a very important thing to ask
[17532.45s -> 17548.52s]  Well, I have to pretend to be a car again. I hope I don't have to
[17549.06s -> 17557.90s]  That would be down who just be ridiculous, right? That would be absurd if I had to go pretend to be a car again
[17557.90s -> 17560.70s]  That's just that's outrageous
[17561.54s -> 17584.72s]  Hey, here we go. It's up here
[17585.30s -> 17598.03s]  That it's a trap. Yeah, there's a trap. I mean, that's a pretty nice super computer. I bet that thing has a fucking 2080
[17600.68s -> 17610.32s]  It is a trap boo boo. Ah, whatever
[17613.19s -> 17636.54s]  No, I want to throw it at the thing. All I care about is throwing this shit
[17637.06s -> 17638.98s]  you deck things
[17638.98s -> 17646.34s]  Freak you freak you freak
[17651.06s -> 17657.22s]  5g noise. All right, somebody has to die. I need help
[17660.63s -> 17662.63s]  Did you die outside of the playing area?
[17662.79s -> 17680.49s]  Good. Oh, come on. They all have the grabby move
[17715.97s -> 17717.97s]  Use your combo. Oh
[17718.77s -> 17720.77s]  You know the words to say to get me going
[17721.29s -> 17730.06s]  There's the fucking 5g noises. I'm gonna mess with my brain
[17730.74s -> 17744.43s]  Alright, so here's the plan. Just kill just kill trying to get out of there quickly. I'm just gonna go
[17745.31s -> 17747.87s]  combo combo combo combo hit hit hit hit hit punch punch punch
[17748.51s -> 17752.99s]  Cuz I need help and I cannot fight
[17755.11s -> 17762.76s]  No, no, no, no, it's not gonna happen. No, he took the bait. Wait a minute. What if I just don't go in there?
[17763.28s -> 17766.11s]  Will they spawn outside?
[17766.11s -> 17774.83s]  Wait a minute. What if they spring the trap when I'm not even in it?
[17791.23s -> 17798.39s]  Oh
[17798.39s -> 17822.26s]  My ears. I'm gonna grab
[17825.30s -> 17846.59s]  Like I'm locked on over here, why would you even be turned the other direction?
[17847.59s -> 17850.91s]  What's the point of a lock-on? We don't even fucking lock on
[17852.11s -> 17882.03s]  So many people got timed out. Yeah, that's then the justice has been served
[17882.47s -> 17896.44s]  But it's sorry what you should have said was justice has been served. I have another idea and
[17897.28s -> 17899.12s]  It's dumb enough to work
[17899.12s -> 17902.19s]  It's gonna work. I'm gonna throw
[17903.11s -> 17907.55s]  Like seven or eight items into the arena the hardcore match now
[17908.15s -> 17922.44s]  Cuz I'm just gonna throw it at the 5g towers and that's it
[17923.73s -> 17938.46s]  I'm just gonna run come here. I'm gonna get steel fists
[17940.42s -> 17943.24s]  Tables ladders and chairs mad snow. This is a truck
[17943.94s -> 17946.37s]  street lights and
[17946.41s -> 17947.69s]  mailbox
[17947.69s -> 17976.50s]  Event let's go
[17976.50s -> 17982.88s]  They're all in there. Good. This is perfect. Perfect. Just get this shit done or of them
[17983.22s -> 17987.45s]  You didn't think I was gonna do this shit. Did you?
[18004.23s -> 18018.04s]  What you doing it?
[18019.04s -> 18024.08s]  You doing it again, okay, just a second. I'm not in a cutscene
[18030.47s -> 18032.19s]  That's not fair
[18032.19s -> 18085.50s]  There's two on top of each other here. Why did you stop hitting the towers?
[18086.37s -> 18091.45s]  We think because the games respawned them and while in the cutscene
[18092.13s -> 18096.21s]  Sorry cow. I got it grabbed and got killed and
[18096.49s -> 18099.67s]  What we were watching the same video
[18100.73s -> 18117.27s]  Okay, fucking come on get out of here

[18132.28s -> 18160.15s]  Tango minus two my fucking god. Oh
[18167.54s -> 18169.14s]  My
[18169.14s -> 18174.65s]  fucking god
[18174.93s -> 18177.69s]  Probability to get grabbed here is like 85%
[18177.69s -> 18178.85s]  85%
[18178.85s -> 18207.60s]  You can't fight them. Have you tried the Hulk smash yet? Shit. I forgot about that one
[18208.16s -> 18215.49s]  What was it called again? What was called Hulk? What? Oh gently pet kitty cat

[18236.10s -> 18242.14s]  No, you can't and then I do they do asterisk asterisk asterisk that means that they link got timed out
[18242.22s -> 18244.22s]  Fifty dollars and I'm gonna buy you a link you're up

[18249.94s -> 18252.18s]  It's an insane amount of money. Thank you for giving it to me
[18252.18s -> 18262.83s]  I can't bring weapons in otherwise the game breaks and decides to respawn everything. I can't fight him cuz I get grabbed
[18263.43s -> 18265.15s]  All right, let's do
[18265.15s -> 18268.59s]  Run and grab and throw what I'm gonna do. You know, here's my strategy already
[18269.39s -> 18276.47s]  Run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw run grab throw

[18445.39s -> 18459.46s]  Right there women right there. Where what do you see?
[18463.38s -> 18466.78s]  Behind me. I don't see anything. It's hard to see anything

[21189.20s -> 21191.57s]  I don't think that's the end of the game
[21191.57s -> 21193.89s]  That's probably very close power surge level three
[21194.69s -> 21196.69s]  Yes
[21197.25s -> 21199.89s]  Okay
[21199.89s -> 21201.89s]  Critical mass level two

[21257.98s -> 21267.01s]  Back to the badlands
[21267.01s -> 21270.05s]  The final boss wasn't patched into the xbox version. That would be weird
[21272.43s -> 21274.67s]  Where is it? Uh down

[21292.00s -> 21294.00s]  another convoy
[21294.00s -> 21300.32s]  Okay, your superhero duties are boring radiation signature coming from a cave near the vault
[21300.80s -> 21304.10s]  It looks like blonsky's undergone yet another transformation
[21304.56s -> 21308.83s]  The creatures headed back towards the inner containment area bruce reached the vault
[21310.03s -> 21312.91s]  Reach the vault entrance just get to the vault entrance. I'm just gonna run

[21329.12s -> 21332.58s]  I'm losing my mind
[21332.66s -> 21338.54s]  I thought I just killed him
[21343.76s -> 21345.12s]  Oh different guy

[21377.28s -> 21379.28s]  Get to the vault entrance
[21379.28s -> 21381.28s]  The vault entrance is down there
[21381.44s -> 21384.82s]  I'm not gonna waste a second here. Let's go
[21385.38s -> 21389.57s]  I want to get some help
[21389.57s -> 21391.17s]  and
[21391.17s -> 21407.09s]  Fuck fighting a single thing
[21407.81s -> 21409.81s]  What who what superhero uses the front door
[21428.51s -> 21430.51s]  Pirate's elbow ain't gonna get me
[21431.39s -> 21435.15s]  You ain't gonna get me. You ain't gonna get me. You ain't gonna get me
[21436.43s -> 21440.35s]  No, you really want to try but it's not going to happen
[21441.07s -> 21443.95s]  Not going to happen
[21445.23s -> 21446.66s]  not
[21446.66s -> 21448.66s]  going to
[21449.58s -> 21450.70s]  Happen
[21450.70s -> 21468.69s]  Probably shouldn't have skipped everything
[21468.85s -> 21472.91s]  I'm gonna do the headbutt to this guy. It's the best move in the game
[21473.63s -> 21489.74s]  Although I can't do the cannonball. I don't have the cannonball. I bought the health and surge upgrades. Whatever they're called
[21490.62s -> 21496.38s]  All right. I'll just throw cars
[21496.38s -> 21498.38s]  Steel fist no throw car is more effective
[21498.94s -> 21511.60s]  How does that miss? Okay again
[21512.66s -> 21513.70s]  Again
[21513.70s -> 21530.05s]  Throw a car again. I'll make sure I get that thing. Don't worry
[21530.77s -> 21537.47s]  It's a secret and we're gonna well, don't we we'll look at those those those comics
[21538.43s -> 21549.30s]  Got a few more of these
[21551.92s -> 21559.90s]  Hey
[21559.90s -> 21573.94s]  What? All right. I need the
[21574.74s -> 21576.02s]  Move this way
[21576.02s -> 21582.67s]  Can I turn these into fists? Oh, I can't
[21584.11s -> 21590.26s]  Dumb why's it no longer damaging him? I think it doesn't hurt him
[21594.08s -> 21595.04s]  Um
[21595.04s -> 21597.47s]  Why am I getting diminishing returns?
[21597.63s -> 21615.78s]  You can't even avoid that attack it's unavoidable use the combo
[21627.34s -> 21630.26s]  Um, can I not fucking hurt this guy?
[21631.44s -> 21643.92s]  What is with this game?
[21643.92s -> 21645.92s]  You can't fucking avoid that attack
[21660.13s -> 21662.13s]  Use elbow drop play on how?
[21662.77s -> 21671.70s]  I can't grab on to anything. I can't grab anything. I can't i'm just gonna do this fine. Okay, I
[21673.07s -> 21675.63s]  That actually just fucking work
[21675.71s -> 21681.41s]  That's okay. That's
[21683.25s -> 21686.21s]  No other moves work on him though only elbow drop
[21688.22s -> 21690.22s]  Oh my god
[21692.35s -> 21694.35s]  Of course, that's the one that works
[21697.30s -> 21708.13s]  All right. We're good. I hope this is just a qte end of the game
[21708.85s -> 21710.85s]  The one time that I actually want it
[21711.25s -> 21713.25s]  That last boss fight was hell
[21713.25s -> 21725.71s]  Baby, i'm here blonsky. I should have come back sooner. Oh god
[21727.07s -> 21729.30s]  I've lost her
[21729.30s -> 21731.22s]  I don't understand

[21736.50s -> 21740.74s]  She's gone
[21740.74s -> 21742.98s]  What's happening here? Emil? Who is she?

[21745.44s -> 21748.48s]  Nadia and my unborn child
[21749.62s -> 21759.30s]  They affected our job was to examine what we knew of gamma radiation and its effect on human tissue
[21759.94s -> 21763.14s]  It was a government sparked by your previous research
[21763.86s -> 21766.74s]  She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer
[21768.53s -> 21770.11s]  Emil
[21770.11s -> 21772.11s]  It's time to bring this to an end
[21772.43s -> 21778.51s]  No, you created gamma transmutation banner you did this to her there it is
[21779.87s -> 21790.54s]  Because of you and your damned experiments kill them you damn freak and now i'm going to return the favor

[21819.89s -> 21824.13s]  Okay, blonsky's headed out of town towards the hydroelectric dam above the city
[21824.61s -> 21827.17s]  You've got to stop him before he can do any damage
[21827.65s -> 21830.93s]  There's not enough time to evacuate everyone unless you can hold him
[21831.57s -> 21833.57s]  What the fuck is this dude? Do you hear me?
[21834.13s -> 21835.65s]  bruce
[21835.65s -> 21841.34s]  all right, there's one reason why this would be okay for me is if

[21847.34s -> 21849.34s]  Then you were trying to warn me an hour ago

[22169.63s -> 22171.31s]  Can we stop?
[22171.31s -> 22180.86s]  I gotta get in front of him so he can take that fucking pain

[22227.17s -> 22231.78s]  Stop shooting the missiles at me
[22233.73s -> 22235.73s]  Well, he's just as irritated as I am
[22236.70s -> 22240.78s]  All right, should I go for a ball? Should I try to ball him? I'm gonna try to bowling ball him
[22241.66s -> 22243.82s]  All right, here we go. I'm gonna bowl him. I'm gonna get the last hit on him
[22244.46s -> 22251.14s]  Okay, here we go bowling
[22251.14s -> 22260.22s]  No, that's not
[22260.22s -> 22268.67s]  What the?
[22272.77s -> 22274.77s]  This is too much for my brain
[22275.65s -> 22283.49s]  This is way too much. I feel like i'm cheating somehow. Don't you feel like I did this that I turned this shit on?
[22284.61s -> 22291.52s]  Here we go again another fight

[22311.25s -> 22313.49s]  I want them to be here. I don't want them to die
[22314.37s -> 22318.08s]  It's making this way easier
[22318.64s -> 22325.60s]  Is he regaining health? I don't think so
[22326.08s -> 22330.64s]  I think this is just supposed to happen except I don't think it's supposed to be like 10 planes fighting us
[22331.36s -> 22333.36s]  I think because I aggroed everything
[22340.54s -> 22343.34s]  I don't think this no, I don't think this is supposed to be how this plays out
[22344.32s -> 22348.29s]  What it is?
[22348.29s -> 22350.21s]  No, don't hit the plane. Fuck
[22350.21s -> 22352.90s]  Okay, let's keep going
[22352.90s -> 22356.56s]  He's headed for the dam
[22356.56s -> 22361.49s]  He's going for the dam. Stop him
[22364.45s -> 22366.45s]  Don't let him hit it
[22367.82s -> 22371.09s]  Oh, no
[22377.63s -> 22380.83s]  Why
[22385.18s -> 22387.98s]  No, it's gonna come back right it's not gonna do this
[22389.84s -> 22392.93s]  Please
[22392.93s -> 22398.18s]  I'm taking the disc out. All right, put it back in quick
[22446.77s -> 22452.85s]  Oh, you can't believe it. I can't believe he's the cutscene for him to break into the dam
[22456.83s -> 22477.47s]  Wait a minute. What is this bullshit? What is this bullshit? What is this? What is this bullshit? What is this?
[22479.23s -> 22491.46s]  This is the mission before that. Okay. We've got a weird gamma. Okay. We've got a weird gamma radiation
[22492.40s -> 22499.63s]  How did I not?
[22500.69s -> 22502.69s]  It's over. Oh
[22503.25s -> 22510.27s]  I can't go on like this
[22510.27s -> 22512.91s]  And this one sucked didn't it? This one sucked, right?
[22513.71s -> 22521.95s]  No, this one's not that bad. It's not that bad. Okay
[22522.83s -> 22527.79s]  All right. So I can't believe he crashed at the dam. I can't believe he crashed in the dam of all the places
[22527.87s -> 22529.87s]  He crashed at the dam
[22529.95s -> 22531.87s]  I can't believe it
[22531.87s -> 22532.99s]  Unbelievable
[22532.99s -> 22544.72s]  It's gonna crash again
[22544.72s -> 22545.92s]  No, it's not
[22545.92s -> 22551.25s]  Don't say that
[22551.25s -> 22567.62s]  There's only one way to that was seriously I had i'm so glad we played this game all the way to the end here
[22568.58s -> 22569.78s]  because that
[22569.78s -> 22571.30s]  last mission
[22571.30s -> 22572.42s]  was
[22572.42s -> 22574.90s]  Just one of the most ridiculous things I think i've seen in a video game
[22575.46s -> 22580.18s]  Like I can't even believe that's possible. Like this shouldn't even that shouldn't even be possible
[22581.50s -> 22583.50s]  But I i'm glad I got to see it
[22584.80s -> 22586.48s]  All right, kill this guy
[22586.48s -> 22618.27s]  All right. We're not that far back. Wait, what? How did you miss the elbow drop? How did you land on a wall?
[22618.99s -> 22621.23s]  How do you land on the wall?
[22622.74s -> 22631.62s]  I don't understand
[22631.62s -> 22637.15s]  Get down
[22637.15s -> 22642.98s]  Where's this guy?
[22642.98s -> 22653.74s]  Get crushed. I'm so glad this actually works
[22654.38s -> 22657.82s]  How sad would it be if I had to actually fight this boss again and potentially lose?
[22665.92s -> 22678.24s]  Huge one to end it. He's trying to do the same shit to me
[22684.13s -> 22690.37s]  There you go. Get the fuck out of here. I win. All right, save the game. Wait, maybe could I not even save the game?
[22691.33s -> 22696.51s]  Is that part of the problem?
[22697.41s -> 22698.93s]  Those coins are
[22698.93s -> 22708.96s]  All right, I got full health
[22708.96s -> 22715.63s]  We just have to do this shit again because it's the same mission
[22718.72s -> 22724.18s]  Are you sure I couldn't save?
[22724.18s -> 22726.18s]  No, it's because it was the same mission
[22728.59s -> 22738.59s]  Right. That's why oh, this is bad. Did raid come in? Oh shit. We did
[22739.79s -> 22742.30s]  Thanks, lazy purple
[22742.30s -> 22749.41s]  Welcome everybody. We're currently trying to do the mission for the second time. We got fucking destroyed
[22750.37s -> 22752.45s]  I
[22752.45s -> 22754.85s]  Can't save it. Yeah, this just can't happen again
[22755.81s -> 22758.69s]  Welcome guys. Thanks a lot. You guys had a good stream
[22759.65s -> 22762.08s]  We've had a good stream here
[22762.08s -> 22763.36s]  Check this out
[22763.36s -> 22766.43s]  You're about to see something real fucked up
[22767.23s -> 22769.23s]  Don't do it again. Let's go
[22771.34s -> 22772.78s]  Just move
[22772.78s -> 22775.02s]  Move with him. You don't have to die. I just have to do anything
[22775.74s -> 22785.94s]  Just heal when I can and that's it. Just grab health clues
[22786.74s -> 22789.22s]  Cubes and squares together health cubes
[22790.46s -> 22791.98s]  I don't know. I've known
[22791.98s -> 22804.67s]  Here we go. Where is he? There he is. Stay with him
[22809.44s -> 22811.44s]  Smash five see what happens. Okay
[22817.23s -> 22819.23s]  Gotta get back up to the fully kill me
[22819.23s -> 22825.71s]  All right, we're about 10% of the way there. That's so much more to do
[22826.85s -> 22829.02s]  We have to run
[22829.02s -> 22837.92s]  All the way all the way
[22839.68s -> 22845.02s]  In fact, i'm getting ready
[22845.02s -> 22854.53s]  All right with my friends

[22866.82s -> 22868.82s]  And then nice miss
[22869.94s -> 22875.95s]  Why would you even attack me at this point?
[22880.83s -> 22891.23s]  Always just hide. How are you all this bad at aiming? You hit me every time. Why can't you hit him?
[22904.29s -> 22912.54s]  Get him this motherfucker is gonna kill me
[22924.21s -> 22927.15s]  I don't know but probably pretty thick

[22936.88s -> 22948.78s]  But then I can just walk around with them fire missiles at him

[23393.09s -> 23396.77s]  All right, this is end game. Do not allow abomination to destroy the damn
[23397.49s -> 23400.53s]  Don't let him destroy the damn
[23400.53s -> 23403.47s]  Sounds fucking hard

[23630.43s -> 23632.43s]  Of course, he would be easier than safe
[23632.67s -> 23637.15s]  Go to one of the generators dude, aren't you don't you want to go break one of the generators?
[23642.11s -> 23644.43s]  Don't fire me
[23644.43s -> 23646.69s]  firing on me
[23646.69s -> 23650.88s]  You're stupid
[23650.88s -> 23653.12s]  You're just dumb. You're firing at the wrong person
[23656.45s -> 23665.34s]  Wait, here we go. Oh shit

[23717.81s -> 23735.02s]  There's a phase two probably
[23735.02s -> 23763.63s]  Did you actually just take out the damn?
[23763.71s -> 23769.15s]  Wait, did he just accidentally kill himself?
[23770.19s -> 23787.73s]  First today releasing almost 20 million metric tons of water in a statement released this morning
[23787.97s -> 23791.27s]  General thaddeus ross blamed the hulk for their devastation
[23792.93s -> 23794.93s]  We had the cure
[23794.93s -> 23796.93s]  It was right there in front of us
[23797.01s -> 23800.93s]  Dreams always are len, but you can never reach out and take them now, can you?
[23801.57s -> 23803.65s]  We could start again and finish this time
[23804.37s -> 23808.88s]  Still helicopters everywhere to let me help you. I can't stay here
[23810.02s -> 23812.02s]  They're too afraid of the hulk to let you try
[23812.74s -> 23815.36s]  I guess this is me len
[23816.00s -> 23818.16s]  I'm not a person anymore. I'm the hulk
[23818.96s -> 23820.96s]  And I can't force people to understand
[23824.05s -> 23826.05s]  Even in cutscenes, it doesn't matter
[23826.37s -> 23829.95s]  This doesn't make any sense bruce
[23831.15s -> 23833.15s]  You don't have anywhere to go
[23833.15s -> 23845.76s]  I don't know people going to work in the morning
[23846.40s -> 23848.40s]  people going on vacation
[23848.40s -> 23851.02s]  we're going to
[23851.02s -> 23853.02s]  the funeral for one of the
[23853.56s -> 23856.22s]  500,000 people you've killed over the last five days bruce
[23857.02s -> 23863.82s]  Will you tell me?
[23863.82s -> 23866.30s]  Congratulations, you've defeated abomination and have completed the game
[23866.94s -> 23869.26s]  You've unlocked hard. I'll never play that one
[23875.02s -> 23877.02s]  Savage banner is now available
[23879.52s -> 23887.18s]  Enter villain to play the game as abomination. That's cool
[23890.00s -> 23899.36s]  Go check the comics. I will you can play as banner the human. That's so stupid
[23900.88s -> 23905.87s]  All right, what is savage banner?
[23906.35s -> 23909.81s]  I don't have access to savage banner
[23915.17s -> 23916.85s]  Where is it?
[23916.85s -> 23919.31s]  Wait, it was at the very top
[23919.31s -> 23924.02s]  I figured it'd be all the way at the bottom savage banner
[23924.98s -> 23935.25s]  You just play as just half naked guy
[23937.78s -> 23939.30s]  Well, that's funny
[23939.30s -> 23941.30s]  Why couldn't I have had that from the beginning of the game?
[23942.02s -> 23958.18s]  All right. Well, let's um, let's go to
[23958.82s -> 23960.90s]  Uh, let's go back extras
[23962.18s -> 23969.70s]  Okay art gallery comic book gallery gallery one. Let's see here. He is
[23970.42s -> 23982.99s]  Incredible hulk the original comic book was just a direct ripoff of frankenstein incredible hope the monster unleashed
[23986.00s -> 23991.82s]  banner the incredible hulk
[23992.30s -> 23995.90s]  They're smashing out and nothing can stop them. Well, it's the juggernaut
[23996.54s -> 23998.54s]  Side by side with the juggernaut
[24004.67s -> 24006.67s]  Incredible hulk and the wolverine
[24007.31s -> 24009.63s]  He's a bad guy hulk was a bad guy for like the first
[24010.35s -> 24011.47s]  30 years
[24011.47s -> 24024.34s]  That's the first comic that wolverine was in what's someone to star on it?
[24031.42s -> 24037.89s]  Who will judge the hulk?
[24038.19s -> 24040.93s]  Fantastic for mr. Mr. Slippery arms. It's like
[24042.21s -> 24044.21s]  I know he's like the smartest man in the world
[24047.66s -> 24062.06s]  His power is just goofy. He's like a clay fighter. Incredible hulk versus the rhino
[24069.15s -> 24072.00s]  Twice the rage
[24072.00s -> 24077.10s]  Cool with me and the boys
[24078.32s -> 24081.17s]  Funko pups
[24081.17s -> 24083.17s]  Incredible hulk. What is this?
[24083.81s -> 24098.58s]  This is a movie incredible hulk. I only have one here
[24101.70s -> 24103.46s]  so strong
[24103.46s -> 24105.46s]  so strong
[24106.02s -> 24110.38s]  I don't remember this
[24110.38s -> 24120.82s]  What's that hulk versus wolverine? Why do they hate each other so much?
[24129.58s -> 24131.84s]  nice
[24131.84s -> 24146.18s]  nice nice nice nice pretty cool sick
[24146.90s -> 24152.86s]  This looks like a goro render. I feel like this is like a mortal kombat render
[24154.46s -> 24160.90s]  That's pretty cool
[24160.90s -> 24162.90s]  These are nice. These are really nice
[24163.98s -> 24165.50s]  That's nice
[24165.50s -> 24169.92s]  Stay away from my coco puffs
[24170.08s -> 24173.89s]  Isn't anyone of those commercials?
[24173.89s -> 24182.06s]  All right movie gallery
[24182.06s -> 24184.54s]  In-game movies. Oh the making of this
[24187.50s -> 24195.34s]  This is the gym that i'm going to show you this is the tool the designers use
[24195.90s -> 24198.14s]  I'm a designer. I want to say okay. Well, what's it like?
[24198.70s -> 24199.50s]  to
[24199.50s -> 24203.33s]  To play a good game kevin too easy too hard
[24204.05s -> 24207.17s]  What is most fun to the player the gym allows the designer?
[24207.81s -> 24214.37s]  To play with these numbers and encounters in a very easy way as an example like right now hulk's max charge jump
[24214.93s -> 24217.01s]  He goes to a height of 20 meters
[24217.01s -> 24221.97s]  So in this tool we can take that number and say bump it up to 40 meters from now
[24222.05s -> 24226.53s]  Holy shit a max charge jump and should jump twice as high. You know how old these computers are
[24227.49s -> 24232.77s]  I could bump it up to six down to one. I could do that. That was a blurred playstation controller
[24232.85s -> 24236.13s]  I did do a lot of the effects basically kind of builds up an effects database
[24236.61s -> 24241.57s]  That we use to blow up our props basically or damage them or make them smoke or make them light on fire
[24241.97s -> 24247.33s]  Anything that blows up or has fire flame smoke debris dirt. That's me nice
[24248.93s -> 24255.60s]  Obviously hulk won every effect took up a chunk of
[24260.06s -> 24267.70s]  Wait, hold on comics found 20 smash point hulk attacks. I did
[24268.64s -> 24270.64s]  2589 attacks. I jumped
[24271.44s -> 24275.81s]  3122 times I died 55 times
[24276.69s -> 24281.57s]  I caught 19 missiles. I weaponized 126 things. I did 100. I did
[24281.65s -> 24283.65s]  12114 combos
[24283.65s -> 24285.65s]  I grabbed 27 things
[24286.11s -> 24288.01s]  I got juggled
[24288.01s -> 24289.79s]  1471 times
[24289.79s -> 24295.02s]  I killed 731 people 43 police 138 soldiers
[24295.64s -> 24297.64s]  104 missile soldiers
[24297.66s -> 24302.06s]  15 transports 76 tanks 74 combat vehicles
[24302.54s -> 24305.34s]  53 gunships 11 strike fighters
[24305.96s -> 24309.74s]  152 infantry destroyers three titans
[24310.62s -> 24314.06s]  12 mrls's two capture wardens
[24314.78s -> 24316.78s]  through 25 soldiers
[24316.86s -> 24335.47s]  Elected 1100 stuff. Very cool. All right. That was fun. See you guys
[24336.43s -> 24342.42s]  Tomorrow do villain. All right, what are some of these codes to put in?
[24342.98s -> 24355.47s]  What are we gonna do tomorrow? That's a good question. That's a really good question. Actually
[24356.19s -> 24365.02s]  What are we gonna do tomorrow?
[24375.25s -> 24377.25s]  toontown
[24377.25s -> 24379.33s]  I don't think I can get toontown set up tomorrow
[24380.13s -> 24382.40s]  All right. What was another one?
[24382.40s -> 24389.18s]  It's easy
[24389.18s -> 24391.74s]  It's so easy. It's so easy
[24392.30s -> 24394.30s]  You can do it. It's so easy
[24396.10s -> 24398.10s]  toontown rewritten is already set up
[24399.15s -> 24403.42s]  toontown
[24403.42s -> 24408.93s]  I'll try i'll look at i'll look into it tomorrow. Well, no, we're gonna like I i'm gonna like
[24409.57s -> 24411.57s]  We're gonna like crash the fucking server
[24411.97s -> 24423.20s]  I'm gonna open up toontown remastered and the servers are gonna turn off. It's not gonna work out
[24423.92s -> 24432.77s]  I'm gonna do like an 80 minute stream delay. What was the suit one?
[24443.20s -> 24445.28s]  Did I I don't did I unlock this suit fit?
[24464.24s -> 24466.26s]  Can't do it character abomination
[24468.35s -> 24483.74s]  All right chase, but no, what was it smash five? It's like almost seven hours i'm going longer than I should be
[24484.78s -> 24493.66s]  Remember I told you guys that I I wanted to have streams capped at like six hours five to six hours max
[24494.54s -> 24499.23s]  Supposed to be moving around
[24499.23s -> 24501.74s]  Uh-oh
[24501.74s -> 24516.13s]  Uh smash five doesn't fit. What does it smash? What smash one five? It just gives me points
[24517.01s -> 24519.38s]  um
[24519.62s -> 24523.70s]  Is there another one?
[24523.70s -> 24525.70s]  Is there a is there one that's even worth doing?
[24532.29s -> 24533.65s]  Oh canada
[24533.65s -> 24538.08s]  Okay, oh canada and then cheese five and then but there's also retro
[24547.84s -> 24551.49s]  Canadian flag shorts, okay. Are they on?
[24554.00s -> 24555.20s]  transit
[24555.20s -> 24571.90s]  Start up the game, dude. I'm I gotta put these in
[24580.59s -> 24582.59s]  mass transit, okay
[24582.67s -> 24596.56s]  Um now what toontown t o n t w n. Oh, i'm sure that works retro retro what is that fit?
[24597.36s -> 24614.19s]  Which are retro retro what?
[24614.75s -> 24624.11s]  Which are what retro 64?
[24630.98s -> 24634.26s]  No, no, no, no, no, no just just retro 64. What?
[24635.30s -> 24655.34s]  I don't care. Let's play with abomination for 12 seconds and then end the stream
[24664.18s -> 24665.38s]  It's me
[24665.38s -> 24681.81s]  Thanks for watching everybody. Well, wait, wait, wait, hold on wrong one. I'm glad we sat there for that long and did that
[24687.46s -> 24689.06s]  See you tomorrow. I'm
[24689.06s -> 24693.94s]  I'm gonna pretend to think i'm gonna pretend to play toontown tomorrow, but it's not gonna happen. I can guarantee it
[24696.78s -> 24698.78s]  One server or two servers
[24699.47s -> 24700.75s]  That are probably
[24700.75s -> 24705.23s]  Just being rented for like less than 100 people to play on that because people really love that game
[24705.23s -> 24707.79s]  We want to keep it going which is very admirable and it's great
[24708.59s -> 24711.79s]  Uh, we're gonna destroy the whole thing and it'll be shut down. It'll be shut off in 10 seconds
[24712.19s -> 24719.36s]  So that's not gonna happen
[24727.06s -> 24729.06s]  I'm willing to give it a look. We'll see
[24731.82s -> 24736.14s]  Anyways, uh, let's do the bits and the subs fairly quickly here because I do want to get up
[24736.78s -> 24739.18s]  Don't uh, i'm going against my new rule
[24740.56s -> 24742.22s]  I said
[24742.22s -> 24743.18s]  uh
[24743.18s -> 24747.42s]  More stream days less stream duration i'm already breaking it because we're about at seven hours
[24747.50s -> 24749.50s]  It's probably going to be about seven and a half hour stream
[24749.98s -> 24751.98s]  I'm supposed to be doing this doctor's orders
[24753.33s -> 24755.25s]  Anyways killcon. Thanks for the three dollars germa
[24755.25s -> 24761.09s]  If you had the choice between banning the top 1000 chatters or selling your funko pops, which would you choose and why?
[24761.89s -> 24764.91s]  I would sell the funko pops because I don't give a shit about them at all
[24765.65s -> 24769.33s]  They're interesting little toys and I think they're cool. I think they're interesting. I would just sell them
[24769.97s -> 24775.02s]  Like immediately like like today. I would just sell them. I'll put them on the market right now
[24776.27s -> 24779.23s]  Hey fitty. Thanks for the thousand bits. Hey germa. Hey fitty
[24779.87s -> 24786.00s]  The jewish bro. Thanks for 540. Are you not doing the movie stream because manos the hands of fate is public domain
[24786.56s -> 24790.40s]  And it's so bad. It's good. It would probably be a certified germa recommends movie tall streamer
[24791.36s -> 24793.66s]  Um, it's um
[24793.74s -> 24795.50s]  I think everybody's seen that movie
[24795.50s -> 24798.64s]  It was on the list, but ever I think everyone has already seen it
[24798.72s -> 24801.84s]  I want to I want to watch public domain movies that i've never seen before
[24802.40s -> 24804.40s]  like the gorilla
[24806.14s -> 24809.90s]  I guarantee you none of you have seen the gorilla and I haven't seen the gorilla
[24810.54s -> 24813.28s]  I don't want to put on a movie that we're just like rewatching
[24814.08s -> 24817.15s]  All right, remember this one manos. Yeah
[24817.79s -> 24822.21s]  They don't almost all of us have seen it, but let's watch it. No, no, no, no, no
[24822.37s -> 24826.21s]  I want new fresh public domain content that you and I have never seen before
[24828.43s -> 24830.43s]  And I guarantee you there's probably
[24830.43s -> 24832.83s]  Less than one person that's seen the gorilla
[24833.98s -> 24841.79s]  In this chat fresh fresh content
[24842.75s -> 24844.35s]  That's the reason why?
[24844.35s -> 24848.27s]  Peaceful haley. Thanks for the 250 germa. How did the move go? It wasn't too much trouble
[24848.75s -> 24852.11s]  Also, I finally got a car almost 23 years old and finally getting a damn car
[24852.75s -> 24856.51s]  Next up is my own place. I feel like i'm going in slow motion when it comes to being an adult
[24856.51s -> 24858.51s]  That's not even not even remotely accurate
[24859.31s -> 24861.31s]  Hope auto is doing well. Have a good night. You're 23
[24862.11s -> 24864.11s]  Let me just let me just stop you there
[24864.27s -> 24866.35s]  Um, I didn't become an adult really
[24867.52s -> 24870.08s]  Until I was like 20 fucking six twenty seven twenty eight
[24870.80s -> 24872.80s]  You got a lot of time. Don't worry
[24874.16s -> 24876.16s]  23 is not
[24876.94s -> 24879.15s]  As old as you think it is
[24879.15s -> 24881.47s]  It's still extraordinarily young
[24886.85s -> 24888.77s]  He thinks he's an adult
[24888.77s -> 24889.97s]  I am
[24889.97s -> 24893.87s]  Yeah, you got plenty of time
[24893.87s -> 24896.46s]  Plenty of time trust me
[24896.54s -> 24898.54s]  Uh, uh the movement good
[24899.31s -> 24901.39s]  It just was talking about slow motion
[24902.11s -> 24904.27s]  it kind of went in slow motion just because of
[24905.15s -> 24907.14s]  how
[24907.14s -> 24910.74s]  All the coronavirus stuff. It's hard to do a lot of stuff hard to set up a lot of things
[24912.13s -> 24914.93s]  Just because of a lot of people had reduced staff
[24916.21s -> 24918.21s]  It was a very slow move
[24918.21s -> 24925.68s]  It's okay
[24925.68s -> 24927.04s]  It is
[24927.04s -> 24932.27s]  Done. We are here
[24932.27s -> 24934.27s]  Yeah, thanks for the 250
[24934.57s -> 24935.95s]  Unkey
[24936.43s -> 24940.11s]  Phil thanks for the five dollars. Would you stream pac-man world for the game cube?
[24940.99s -> 24945.18s]  I mean, I love pac-man. So you you can't you don't have to do much to convince me
[24945.58s -> 24948.62s]  There's not a whole lot of arm twisting to get me to play a pac-man game
[24949.68s -> 24952.64s]  Even though I think I played one pac-man game in six years
[24953.36s -> 24955.36s]  Still you don't have to twist my arm that hard
[24955.36s -> 24958.64s]  And the one pac-man game that I played in six years was not even a pac-man game
[24958.96s -> 24962.72s]  It was pac-man was in the game. It was smash brothers for the wii u
[24963.36s -> 24964.48s]  so
[24964.48s -> 24966.08s]  Maybe you have to go even longer
[24966.08s -> 24973.73s]  Thanks a lot rick bilby. Thanks for the four dollars germany your streams are an escape and without them
[24973.73s -> 24975.25s]  I would be in a worse place
[24975.25s -> 24980.53s]  Please don't buy any more funko pops or i'll have to make a reddit account. Don't worry. I have bought I had
[24981.49s -> 24983.49s]  If I bought funko pops who gives a shit
[24983.57s -> 24987.33s]  But I didn't all the things on the shelf that you see behind you were purchased
[24988.05s -> 24990.05s]  As of about three years ago
[24991.02s -> 24999.22s]  Not purchased a funko pop in three years. It's time to get over it. It's time to get over this guys
[25001.25s -> 25003.25s]  Uh crump. Oh crumpo
[25004.38s -> 25006.22s]  Thank you crumpo for the 15 dollars
[25006.22s -> 25009.90s]  I think that burger joke should be on the nominations for best joke with more than five minutes to set up
[25010.30s -> 25012.54s]  As I feel like your entire life was set up for that joke
[25013.18s -> 25015.54s]  I don't I disagree
[25015.54s -> 25021.10s]  Does it I completely disagree?
[25023.28s -> 25025.28s]  It wasn't a worst or best
[25025.28s -> 25029.86s]  It was a setup. We were trying to we were setting up everybody
[25030.86s -> 25032.86s]  Thanks for the 15 dollars. It's a lot of money
[25033.68s -> 25039.68s]  Shibiririririru. Ah, thanks for the three dollars. See the secret is a great home cooked burger is a well oiled
[25040.08s -> 25044.08s]  Real hot cast iron skillet get your well seasoned meat. Hopefully 80 20
[25044.72s -> 25046.48s]  and stick it
[25046.48s -> 25049.28s]  In the skillet then smash it down with a spatula until it's thin
[25049.68s -> 25052.56s]  You cook in a few minutes and be extremely delicious. You forgot to say flip it
[25053.12s -> 25058.64s]  I didn't hear you say flip the burger. So I just didn't flip it and in a few minutes. I have half of raw burger
[25060.93s -> 25063.17s]  Not a good you got be specific
[25063.73s -> 25073.22s]  Thanks for the recipe mono cucumber. Thanks for 258 germ. I've been able to catch a lot more streams lately
[25073.78s -> 25076.66s]  Streams and videos really help me keep sane in the lockdown. So thank you
[25077.22s -> 25082.58s]  Anyways, I recently was playing around with some parts. I built a lego germa with multiple hairs for your variations
[25083.30s -> 25088.18s]  Those are included parts guide in case you or someone in chat wanted to build one for yourselves
[25094.46s -> 25096.46s]  With the nightwing shirt
[25103.68s -> 25108.26s]  Take a look at that. I'll show this one here. This is the most important one
[25109.22s -> 25111.38s]  This is the most important one for sure. Look at this
[25120.58s -> 25122.82s]  How would they both the bazooka image? I don't understand
[25126.24s -> 25139.60s]  I just saved it as this
[25139.60s -> 25146.54s]  Here we go
[25146.54s -> 25151.58s]  The hair is pretty accurate. The bottom right hair is perfect top left hair is perfect
[25157.02s -> 25159.02s]  Is that that's actual lego?
[25160.22s -> 25171.36s]  Serial numbers
[25172.48s -> 25182.35s]  I don't think legos do cereal. No like the serial number
[25188.86s -> 25193.34s]  This is such like a high quality photo. I feel like this should be a like a profile picture somewhere for me
[25194.43s -> 25196.43s]  But if you have a lego profile picture
[25196.91s -> 25198.67s]  I don't know if I want to do that
[25198.67s -> 25210.16s]  Oh look, it's auto
[25210.16s -> 25213.20s]  And down. All right. All right. All right. All right
[25214.56s -> 25216.56s]  You don't use twitter. Anyways, no, I don't
[25216.64s -> 25219.31s]  That's a very accurate statement
[25219.31s -> 25221.95s]  Thanks for the legos and there you go. You guys have the pieces if you want to make your own
[25222.75s -> 25224.59s]  uh lego germa
[25224.59s -> 25229.31s]  I feel like I don't know to like to burn or something to be like a voodoo doll and try to hurt me on whatever
[25229.31s -> 25231.31s]  You guys are gonna do with that
[25231.63s -> 25234.78s]  Thanks for the 250
[25234.78s -> 25236.78s]  Uh, sir canine. Thanks for the 250
[25238.26s -> 25242.82s]  Vocal and rage streamer takes out rage on us soldiers by playing mini games with their mangled corpses

[25268.78s -> 25275.47s]  Uh, you just gave I just got an idea. Um, I think all the shark tank people do cameos
[25276.67s -> 25280.35s]  What if I just pay them all a ton of fucking money, whatever their cameos are
[25281.23s -> 25284.35s]  And have them just react to my shitty shark tank presentation

[25309.51s -> 25319.01s]  Forward, I know at least three or four of them do cameos. I'm certain of it

[25358.08s -> 25360.08s]  They cost a thousand dollars
[25360.08s -> 25366.60s]  I know i'm supposed to get through this quickly, but
[25367.24s -> 25369.54s]  What do you mean? They cost a thousand dollars
[25369.86s -> 25374.21s]  Meo.com

[25416.10s -> 25418.10s]  To do about one one to two minutes
[25419.44s -> 25421.92s]  I'm looking for like five to ten minutes of footage
[25424.87s -> 25426.87s]  I would have to pay kevin o'leary
[25427.19s -> 25429.19s]  About ten to fifteen thousand dollars
[25430.53s -> 25439.62s]  To make me like ten of these
[25439.62s -> 25441.86s]  Who are some of the other sharks? Because I know there's a couple
[25446.31s -> 25450.39s]  Damon robert barbara there. Oh my god
[25452.85s -> 25455.97s]  Barbara's 600 robert is 500
[25457.62s -> 25460.10s]  Damon is 199. All right, damon
[25461.33s -> 25475.84s]  Seriously, thanks for at least being 200 not fucking 500. All right, so we got four sharks
[25476.48s -> 25483.65s]  All right, how much?
[25483.65s -> 25487.25s]  One of them should just be like a happy birthday and shit
[25487.81s -> 25492.61s]  Like excuse me. I'll just let me can I just hear from what can I just hear from kevin see if he has an offer?
[25493.09s -> 25500.32s]  Say happy birthday to you jeremy's very very important day because he was too expensive
[25500.32s -> 25505.88s]  So I just had him do one. I like this idea and it's in shitty dumb shit like this
[25506.80s -> 25509.84s]  Starts to get my brain going and then I get into it and I really want to do it
[25510.08s -> 25516.26s]  This is this is like a twenty to thirty thousand dollar project
[25517.20s -> 25518.40s]  great
[25518.40s -> 25520.21s]  Okay
[25520.21s -> 25530.47s]  Cool. All right. We'll take a look at that. Oh, yeah

[25536.96s -> 25538.96s]  If it's not real, I don't want to do it
[25539.28s -> 25548.02s]  You understand it has to be like that. Well, we know how much that costs

[25656.26s -> 25659.03s]  Just need to find the right
[25659.03s -> 25661.83s]  Time and reason to do it
[25661.83s -> 25664.23s]  We're having trouble counting to two recently on this stream
[25665.84s -> 25668.21s]  And it's got to change

[25714.37s -> 25715.33s]  Thank you
[25715.33s -> 25722.79s]  Everybody knows that already though. My friend just showed me the mega milk picture
[25723.88s -> 25725.16s]  unfriend him
[25725.16s -> 25738.79s]  for her
[25740.92s -> 25745.98s]  Hey sikilos, thanks for the 250. Jeremiah. I just finished watching the first eight seasons of caribbeanthusiasm
[25746.62s -> 25750.06s]  Thanks to you recommending it at the start of a stream a few months ago
[25751.64s -> 25756.52s]  Yep, you got any other suggestions for me lots of love mom
[25758.38s -> 25760.38s]  I'm so glad you watched it
[25760.86s -> 25764.54s]  What a fantastic show what a perfect every episode is perfect
[25766.47s -> 25768.47s]  Uh, sure. I have a comedy
[25769.50s -> 25776.65s]  Um, I haven't caught up with the last few seasons the last maybe two or three seasons, but silicon valley is was hilarious
[25777.21s -> 25779.03s]  It's a mike judge
[25779.03s -> 25783.67s]  Brand show mike judge if you don't know is the guy responsible for beavis and butthead an office space
[25784.71s -> 25788.70s]  And it's hilarious
[25788.70s -> 25789.66s]  really
[25789.66s -> 25791.82s]  Smart well-written show is really funny
[25792.62s -> 25798.06s]  Uh, yeah, people are saying always sunny in philadelphia. That's another fantastic show where almost every episode is perfect
[25798.70s -> 25802.49s]  The exceptions are maybe a few but you can't everything can't be perfect
[25803.21s -> 25810.44s]  We already went over that earlier
[25810.44s -> 25813.35s]  prairieland park boys, you know
[25813.35s -> 25816.15s]  I can't say yes to that because i've seen
[25817.03s -> 25820.79s]  Like six or seven episodes of trailer park boys and it was like it was funny it was
[25821.51s -> 25822.87s]  but I just
[25822.87s -> 25825.03s]  I didn't I didn't I didn't watch anymore
[25826.01s -> 25832.02s]  Not because I didn't think it was any good
[25832.02s -> 25834.34s]  But I I didn't grab me hard
[25834.66s -> 25839.86s]  The one thing that I didn't think was really funny and they stuck with this for from my understanding almost the entire show
[25841.03s -> 25843.03s]  Is the guy not ricky?
[25843.59s -> 25847.35s]  And not not not and not this guy either not bobbles. Who's the other guy?
[25848.31s -> 25851.53s]  The guy that just always had a drink in his hand julian. Yeah
[25852.25s -> 25853.05s]  julian
[25853.05s -> 25856.09s]  Broke the course of the whole show and they they ran with this forever
[25856.90s -> 25861.94s]  There's every time he's on camera. He has a drink in his hand like a whiskey and coke
[25863.02s -> 25870.26s]  Every single scene he's in every single fucking episode. It's just that's absolutely hysterical
[25873.34s -> 25878.70s]  That is by far one of the funniest things I've I you could ever do and to keep that going
[25879.18s -> 25881.42s]  It's just ridiculous
[25881.58s -> 25886.62s]  Why is that but he's so my purpose would be so painful to do after even one season
[25890.52s -> 25894.12s]  Even after a car crash he was in a car crash
[25894.84s -> 25899.64s]  Wait, he got he was at a in a car crash and then going to the hospital. What?
[25906.57s -> 25908.41s]  Uh, maybe I
[25908.41s -> 25910.41s]  Should I give that show another chance?
[25911.66s -> 25914.70s]  He crawled out of the wrecked car with with a drink in his hand
[25916.98s -> 25920.44s]  I can't believe that they kept that going and it did under any circumstance
[25927.31s -> 25932.03s]  Yeah, I mean it was I I chuckled. I thought it was funny. I thought it was smart and interesting
[25932.83s -> 25935.71s]  But I just never grabbed on top of it and grabbed it
[25936.35s -> 25938.36s]  I never grabbed me in the head
[25938.36s -> 25940.36s]  But maybe i'll give it another chance. It was funny
[25941.92s -> 25947.76s]  Hey mick mussels. Thanks for the thousand bits feeling generous. Love you germa and chat
[25948.94s -> 25950.38s]  And you you too
[25950.38s -> 25958.52s]  Hey lm man. Thanks for the three dollars germa gorge your hatred embrace your rage on chat. I already did
[25960.19s -> 25961.15s]  you
[25961.15s -> 25963.15s]  You had to have been there when I did the
[25963.63s -> 25966.59s]  The if you put a link in the chat, you're gonna get timed up in 10 minutes
[25967.15s -> 25973.18s]  That was unleashing a lot of people got timed up
[25974.28s -> 25976.12s]  And again lm man. Thanks for four dollars germa
[25976.12s -> 25982.20s]  I gifted 10 community subs yesterday because the day before that I promised to myself that if auto was better by tomorrow
[25982.94s -> 25986.33s]  I would give subs
[25986.33s -> 25990.24s]  Thanks a lot. That means a lot
[25990.48s -> 25992.48s]  He's doing good. He's actually doing really good now
[25993.68s -> 25996.00s]  His antibiotic stint is over
[25997.23s -> 25999.87s]  And he seems to be back to normal
[26000.43s -> 26002.73s]  But I am going to go to the vet
[26003.05s -> 26003.85s]  uh
[26003.85s -> 26005.93s]  A day or two from now probably on monday or tuesday
[26007.23s -> 26009.23s]  To just do a recheck
[26009.47s -> 26012.03s]  Maybe just talk to the vet again and say hey it's been
[26012.75s -> 26014.67s]  Been on the antibiotics for a week
[26014.67s -> 26015.79s]  He's better
[26015.79s -> 26019.20s]  Is there anything else you want to do?
[26019.20s -> 26022.96s]  But he is seems like he's fine. That's really good. I'm really glad to see that
[26024.41s -> 26029.85s]  Thank you. Hey yoda 985. Thanks for the 250 for your information. Mr. Streamer. My username is in a short joke
[26030.41s -> 26032.96s]  But i'll change it if it makes you upset is not
[26035.66s -> 26041.42s]  Yoda 985 is not a your short joke. That's i'm surprised by that. I'll be honest with you
[26041.90s -> 26057.08s]  I you know how many photoshops of yoda with my face green on it i've seen at least a handful of times i've seen um
[26059.04s -> 26061.61s]  mini me and yoda
[26061.61s -> 26065.77s]  At least a dozen times in the last year. So sorry for jumping to that conclusion
[26066.57s -> 26068.57s]  You keep that name. You don't have to change it. It's your name
[26071.23s -> 26074.03s]  a g m egon thanks to five dollars
[26074.59s -> 26079.85s]  Remember you can't keep moving forever. The police will find you one day and take you back to boston for the santa trial
[26080.49s -> 26087.10s]  Also, thank you for providing entertainment right now. I'm an essential worker and it's been stressful very stressful out there
[26087.74s -> 26090.70s]  Your streams are a highlight of my day and they give me something to laugh to
[26091.82s -> 26093.04s]  Yes
[26093.04s -> 26094.80s]  I need a new trailer
[26094.80s -> 26096.80s]  Lady for the rumble or ladder match
[26098.44s -> 26101.02s]  Because we got all right. We're gonna talk about this
[26103.16s -> 26105.66s]  We i'm going to hold
[26106.22s -> 26111.64s]  For the first time ever and this is a big change and a lot of people might not want to see this change
[26111.72s -> 26113.96s]  but a lot of people might be happy about this
[26115.60s -> 26117.60s]  I think we're going to do
[26118.49s -> 26121.10s]  a
[26121.10s -> 26123.02s]  Almost like a nomination
[26123.02s -> 26124.30s]  for characters
[26124.30s -> 26129.34s]  And not a nomination for characters, but like a wish list that a lot because i'll be very honest
[26129.90s -> 26133.42s]  The last time we did a rumble typically they would happen once every
[26133.98s -> 26137.76s]  Seven or eight months once every like once a year because it's been so long
[26139.72s -> 26143.08s]  It's been almost a year and a half or so since the last one right at least
[26143.72s -> 26145.72s]  13 14 15 months
[26146.04s -> 26147.80s]  There's a lot of characters
[26147.80s -> 26154.01s]  There's a lot of people that have been on streams and little jokes that have been made tons of them and
[26154.41s -> 26156.41s]  It's been a long time since the last rumble
[26156.92s -> 26158.60s]  So what i'm probably going to do
[26158.60s -> 26163.88s]  Is once it gets closer to the boston marathon we can actually really lock that all in and that it's
[26164.28s -> 26170.76s]  We're hopefully back to normal by september or at least somewhat normal normal enough to do the marathon
[26170.76s -> 26177.61s]  I guess i'm saying open up a wish list where on the discord or something
[26177.61s -> 26181.92s]  We'll have a channel where we'll just make a big list and then from that list
[26183.40s -> 26187.56s]  But potentially I will go through and pick out characters that I think I would like to make
[26188.83s -> 26190.91s]  Or we can even pick them ourselves on stream
[26191.60s -> 26197.05s]  But I don't think I want to do that with everybody because I think some of the fun at least for me is making characters
[26197.05s -> 26200.94s]  You don't know that are going to show up
[26202.27s -> 26207.47s]  So you guys knowing all the entrants to me in all the matches I think is I don't really like that
[26207.87s -> 26212.16s]  As much as I could so maybe at least a wish list and then
[26212.64s -> 26217.44s]  Maybe at least bring in five to ten people that chat really wanted and then i'll just make the rest
[26217.68s -> 26225.92s]  That's kind of the idea but thanks for the five dollars
[26226.48s -> 26234.96s]  And take care of yourself being an essential worker right now is very stressful. I can imagine thanks to the five bucks
[26236.72s -> 26239.28s]  Five dollars from tj the duke. Thanks for the five bucks
[26239.28s -> 26243.92s]  I used to watch your old tf2 vids back in 2012 to 14 got me through some tough times
[26244.41s -> 26248.01s]  That has recently looked you up for some nostalgia and it's good to see you're still doing your thing
[26250.51s -> 26258.49s]  Yeah, we're still going not playing really team fortress anymore, but still going still just hanging out
[26258.57s -> 26267.53s]  Trying to have a good time a few days a week. I see no reason to stop
[26268.99s -> 26277.02s]  Thanks to five bucks and welcome back killcon. Thanks for five dollars german
[26277.02s -> 26280.67s]  Did you know that plants while plants do not have nerves?
[26281.15s -> 26286.27s]  They have calcium gated networks that use glutamate to propagate information across their bodies
[26287.04s -> 26293.05s]  We've observed that this system is functionally identical to a nervous system and plants not only sense things
[26293.05s -> 26296.97s]  But also learn it's an entire rabbit hole of mounting evidence
[26297.45s -> 26304.36s]  In support of plant cognition where plants are as aware and intelligent as animals. Isn't that just quacking crazy?
[26304.44s -> 26307.64s]  What are your thoughts on that?
[26307.64s -> 26313.04s]  Uh, they terrified me. That's the scariest thing i've ever heard because if plants can become
[26313.84s -> 26319.80s]  Completely sentient and we're all fucking we're dead. That's terrifying
[26320.04s -> 26330.49s]  Imagine if the trees got sentient if they didn't want what if they didn't like us they would come up
[26330.73s -> 26343.63s]  They'd find some like fucking toxin they'd find. Oh, this is um, that's uh
[26343.95s -> 26350.30s]  Yeah, that happened today. Uh, I think that's a thing that happened piece of fiction
[26353.21s -> 26354.91s]  anyways, um
[26354.91s -> 26356.91s]  That was
[26358.76s -> 26359.80s]  Shit
[26359.80s -> 26363.96s]  No, don't listen to anything. I'm saying just blah blah blah blah. Look at me. You're super stupid
[26363.96s -> 26366.76s]  He's going off on a crazy rant again, and he's crazy
[26367.63s -> 26374.46s]  Um, yeah, that's scary though weird thought thanks four to five for the three dollars
[26374.78s -> 26378.60s]  No message just three bucks volemy five dollars on top of
[26379.34s -> 26382.09s]  Uh, fucking fifty dollars
[26382.17s -> 26384.73s]  Let me get five thousand bits earlier
[26385.74s -> 26389.50s]  This is 55 total dollars tonight from volemy germa. You scanned me out of a link
[26389.74s -> 26391.74s]  so I demand that you play the
[26392.27s -> 26411.90s]  You've been known video to make up for it band links. That's all you get
[26413.92s -> 26417.20s]  Hey atlantius. Thanks for the thousand bits since classes are online
[26418.83s -> 26420.83s]  We have to type out responses from math
[26421.55s -> 26428.11s]  One of the answers was negative two and I immediately thought the teacher made a bad joke and laughed way too hard about it
[26428.59s -> 26431.55s]  Thanks for making our lives a little happier. Even when you're not there
[26433.32s -> 26436.92s]  Oh god
[26436.92s -> 26439.42s]  Minus two
[26439.42s -> 26442.81s]  That's funny
[26442.97s -> 26452.49s]  Well, that makes me happy. I'm glad to hear that the stream can permeate
[26453.21s -> 26455.21s]  into other places in your life
[26455.53s -> 26458.97s]  Hopefully in a good way and not in a bad way. I hope nobody actually is
[26459.53s -> 26461.93s]  What do you say say something really bad from this stream?
[26462.57s -> 26469.24s]  We're having fun. All right. Hey genie boy. Thanks for the 250 germa
[26469.24s -> 26471.96s]  This is my second time watching your stream last one was yesterday
[26473.39s -> 26476.20s]  Hey, what do you think?
[26476.20s -> 26477.47s]  thoughts
[26477.47s -> 26481.56s]  Let's hear him. I've been watching the videos for a little over a year. Okay. All right
[26481.56s -> 26483.08s]  So you're you're fairly new
[26483.08s -> 26487.90s]  I just want to say that your videos and now streams are giving me so much joy and have helped me through some dark times
[26488.54s -> 26493.66s]  I just got my tax return yesterday. So i'm excited to support you in these crazy times peace and love
[26494.38s -> 26500.27s]  Thanks for the 250 really hope that you take care of yourself
[26501.23s -> 26508.64s]  Most importantly you got your uh tax return
[26510.33s -> 26512.41s]  Take care of yourself. Make sure you're taken care of
[26514.67s -> 26516.67s]  Be very very low down on that list
[26517.68s -> 26519.56s]  And if you get there
[26519.56s -> 26522.19s]  All right, i'll gladly take it
[26522.19s -> 26524.01s]  Thanks a lot
[26524.01s -> 26526.25s]  And welcome to the streams
[26526.25s -> 26527.77s]  video watcher
[26527.77s -> 26535.34s]  Thanks a lot genie boy plop one down. Thanks for three dollars. They say thanks man. Thank you
[26536.06s -> 26539.76s]  Get the credits on the screen. Let's roll them
[26541.18s -> 26545.10s]  Seven and a half hours. I told you this was never going to happen ever again. And how long did that last?
[26546.06s -> 26547.26s]  uh
[26547.26s -> 26548.86s]  Um a week
[26548.86s -> 26551.66s]  Yeah, this this was never this was never supposed to happen ever again
[26552.44s -> 26557.00s]  I actually said that was it was never gonna happen again. I said there'll never be a stream more than six hours ever again
[26557.64s -> 26567.28s]  I was wrong
[26567.28s -> 26570.65s]  But well, hold on this
[26570.65s -> 26572.65s]  Okay, hear me out on this
[26572.89s -> 26575.93s]  the reason why this wasn't like a four to five hour stream today
[26576.81s -> 26578.41s]  is because
[26578.41s -> 26582.17s]  At around the four to five hour mark on the stream. I realized
[26584.08s -> 26586.80s]  I probably only have another hour or so left in hulk
[26587.44s -> 26589.26s]  Am I just gonna
[26589.26s -> 26592.06s]  Stop the stream and not finish this game
[26594.11s -> 26600.75s]  Right, so it's okay. I did say that there was never going to be a stream again more than five or six hours
[26601.39s -> 26604.52s]  But there are some exceptions
[26604.52s -> 26611.93s]  Like wanting to complete a game that I know I can complete in less than six to seven hours. There's some exceptions
[26613.05s -> 26623.85s]  That won't always happen though. But thanks again everybody for subbing. It means a lot. Thank you. Thanks for giving me money
[26623.93s -> 26629.05s]  Thanks for paying me money
[26629.05s -> 26631.23s]  Thanks a million times
[26632.65s -> 26636.99s]  Immortal draculich, thanks to the five dollars germa. Do you have any interest in playing the prototype series?
[26637.63s -> 26641.40s]  They're also by radical. They have a very similar feel to ultimate destruction
[26642.04s -> 26644.52s]  Yeah, I actually tried to play prototype a long time ago
[26645.47s -> 26648.35s]  And it didn't work. I couldn't get it to work. So i'd probably just get it for xbox
[26648.99s -> 26660.12s]  And do that or xbox 360 or something eventually we'll go back to it knife boy. Thanks for three dollars. Do a hulk impression
[26662.54s -> 26666.84s]  Thanks to the three bucks
[26666.84s -> 26671.72s]  Hey bug smoke. Thanks for five dollars germa toontown rewritten supports over a thousand players
[26672.36s -> 26676.84s]  And the servers have player limits specifically so that people don't overload and crash servers
[26677.56s -> 26688.30s]  Be a really cool game to see you stream really i'll see if I can get it to work. I'll try i'll try it
[26692.17s -> 26693.29s]  I'll give it a look
[26693.29s -> 26697.63s]  I can get it set up and get ready and do it by tomorrow then whatever what i'll try it
[26701.04s -> 26703.68s]  Thanks for the five dollars bug smoke and for the good tip
[26704.56s -> 26709.68s]  Mostly lost. Thanks for 250 put a one in chat. If you haven't seen manos the hands of fate. Well, this is also
[26710.48s -> 26719.60s]  There's also a lot of liars here
[26719.60s -> 26721.60s]  Seeing at least one liar
[26726.70s -> 26728.06s]  Me, no
[26728.06s -> 26733.12s]  All right, but but for for trial period
[26733.36s -> 26737.68s]  I want to watch something that I haven't seen and that a lot of people haven't seen a lot of people have seen manos the hands
[26737.76s -> 26739.76s]  Of fate, let's just be honest
[26740.24s -> 26745.84s]  I know that people think it's hilarious and people really like it. It's such a bad bad shitty public domain move
[26745.84s -> 26747.44s]  Right. Everyone says that
[26747.44s -> 26751.77s]  But a lot of people have seen it not a whole by comp by contrast
[26752.57s -> 26754.49s]  Shit little people haven't seen
[26754.57s -> 26758.64s]  The gorilla i've just given you statements that are accurate
[26765.29s -> 26767.10s]  funny monkey
[26767.10s -> 26768.62s]  We'll see how funny
[26768.62s -> 26776.22s]  Thanks to the 250 and thank you sir canaan for the 250. I can't wait to see purple hulk in revenger's end war
[26776.70s -> 26779.26s]  The forever glove is pretty cool, too
[26783.00s -> 26789.04s]  Um for some reason I thought I thought this was just an absolute gibberish sentence
[26789.52s -> 26797.66s]  I can't wait to see purple hulk in revenger's end war. The forever glove is pretty cool
[26799.50s -> 26802.06s]  Wait, is it? Oh it is it's like a joke
[26802.94s -> 26805.02s]  Right, like the infinity gauntlet
[26805.66s -> 26810.38s]  The avengers. Okay, it is. I don't know they they name so much weird shit these days
[26811.42s -> 26813.74s]  Like ultimate zombie avengers. I don't know
[26814.38s -> 26816.16s]  All right. It's a joke. Okay
[26816.16s -> 26818.16s]  Hey, mitchell. Thanks for 20 dollars mitchell
[26819.34s -> 26821.34s]  2000 bits
[26821.36s -> 26828.70s]  Thanks for the 20 bucks. Thanks for playing a hulk ultimate destruction germa. Glad you enjoyed it ridiculous as it can get
[26829.26s -> 26836.38s]  I played it too alongside the stream and the completion time difference may have been double digits, but I really enjoyed watching you play
[26844.08s -> 26849.20s]  Double digits as in like, you know, that's 30 seconds. That's that could be 10 seconds
[26850.48s -> 26853.44s]  So you beat the game 12 seconds faster than I did
[26854.00s -> 26857.60s]  All right double digits faster if toontown does not end up being a game for tomorrow
[26857.92s -> 26862.48s]  Uh, if it does end up being it it'll be a blast take care and have a great night, man
[26863.04s -> 26872.38s]  I'll try i'm gonna give it a real try. Thanks for the 20 dollars. And yeah, the game was fun. It was hilarious
[26874.38s -> 26881.18s]  Uh, thank you cubite for the three dollars. I sampled the gorilla for my lo-fi hip-hop ep you uncultured swine
[26881.90s -> 26885.74s]  All right. Well, we haven't seen it. I haven't seen it
[26886.06s -> 26895.20s]  All right, you are like one of five people that have seen that movie here. Hey blackout. Thanks for the three dollars
[26897.31s -> 26898.35s]  uh
[26898.35s -> 26904.35s]  Joey zio and at toontown are their twitterers with the head dev in the server the server capacity is 10,000
[26905.07s -> 26907.07s]  And originally had 4,000 active users
[26907.71s -> 26913.07s]  Him the tat man with 12,000 viewers was able to stream the game. So you should be able to go tomorrow. Okay. Well, all right
[26915.98s -> 26919.42s]  All right. Yeah. All right. I I I was under the assumption that it was like an old
[26920.06s -> 26925.50s]  Like pieced together project that maybe like a few hundred to a thousand people could do. I didn't I don't know
[26925.58s -> 26928.73s]  Is that popular? I don't know. Is that popular?
[26929.45s -> 26931.45s]  You can help with any configs
[26932.11s -> 26934.43s]  Well tomorrow around like three o'clock
[26935.15s -> 26937.55s]  I'll be here

[26941.84s -> 26944.68s]  3 p.m pacific, by the way
[26944.68s -> 26949.40s]  I'll try to over that like from like 230 to like 330 is when i'm going to try to figure this all out
[26949.88s -> 26958.78s]  if there's any problems or any configuration issues, then uh, absolutely we'll ask in the chat, but
[26959.44s -> 26964.32s]  No, I mean if if somebody like tim the tat man can do it and not crash the server then we should be fine
[26964.40s -> 26966.64s]  Yeah, that's because I have
[26966.88s -> 26971.84s]  More less than half of the those numbers. So that should be fine
[26975.18s -> 26983.23s]  Guillotine senpai, thanks for the 250 new emote promise. It's not bernie pog and it's uh, oh they got the link got removed

[27071.48s -> 27080.65s]  Now he will definitely be a participant without a doubt in my mind. There isn't evil four. I plan on it
[27082.00s -> 27086.88s]  Slom.com. Thanks for three dollars. Hey germa eight year viewer first time bitgiver. Love your work

[27099.47s -> 27108.83s]  That's a lot. That's almost a decade. That's almost 10 years. The 10 year anniversary is actually coming up sooner than a lot of people think
[27111.34s -> 27112.87s]  june
[27112.87s -> 27119.24s]  2011 was when the stream when the videos the channel started
[27120.51s -> 27126.06s]  So if june 2011 was the first video then june 2021
[27127.16s -> 27132.81s]  Is 10 years that's a 10 year anniversary stream from inside of a cake
[27132.97s -> 27145.40s]  We'll see what I do for 10 years, but thanks for the three bucks and thanks for sticking around and that is the end
[27145.48s -> 27148.52s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow for maybe toontown

[27156.30s -> 27161.66s]  For tomorrow, we're going back to like the rules which are like four to six hours
[27161.98s -> 27169.42s]  I just wanted to finish the hulk right at the very end. We had 250 from goo berry juice. Thanks goo berry juice
[27170.62s -> 27176.84s]  Hola, gerbacola. I really need to talk to you about this voice you do but the actual it's a band link
[27177.00s -> 27178.92s]  What the actual fuck is it supposed to be dude?
[27178.92s -> 27182.76s]  I see people in chat calling it double d from ed ed netty impression
[27182.76s -> 27187.87s]  But that shit sounds exactly like cow from cow and chicken sounds nothing like ed
[27187.95s -> 27192.28s]  And there's no way you watched cow and chicken as a kid. No one did so what's the deal with that voice?
[27193.82s -> 27200.40s]  um just run
[27200.80s -> 27203.44s]  Hold on like it's been that's been almost seven and a half hours

[27209.05s -> 27211.05s]  Charlie adler did every fucking voice on that show
[27212.78s -> 27215.12s]  Did you know that?
[27215.12s -> 27218.97s]  Charlie adler did red butt guy cow
[27219.69s -> 27227.47s]  And chicken now you have to be the top of your game to be able to do something like that
[27230.51s -> 27234.38s]  Uh charlie adler is one of those inspirations. It's like
[27235.42s -> 27239.50s]  Probably like in top five like how it inspired everything that I do
[27241.32s -> 27247.40s]  I love charlie adler's characters charlie adler when he goes like this and he's able to care
[27248.04s -> 27254.73s]  Like nobody can do it. It's only only charlie can do that. I'm speaking like only charlie, you know my buddy charlie. No charlie adler

[27312.60s -> 27315.88s]  I would turn green if larry david walked in my room
[27316.52s -> 27320.92s]  I mean if I was at a convention and larry david was there and he's like, oh you want me to sign something
[27321.56s -> 27323.56s]  You i'd be like hi
[27324.36s -> 27326.36s]  I would just turn fucking green and be like

[27346.84s -> 27354.30s]  Anyways, don't put losers in the rumble, please. Wait, what?
[27355.77s -> 27359.05s]  Oh, you mean like the people that actually lost the rumble uh for a second
[27359.13s -> 27361.29s]  I was like, wait, I thought you're talking about larry david
[27361.77s -> 27364.01s]  I was like what the fuck did that what did you just say?
[27366.97s -> 27370.09s]  You mean like actually physically people that didn't people that lost
[27370.81s -> 27376.02s]  No, they have we have to have all right if if like john cena gets eliminated
[27377.34s -> 27379.10s]  As number 10
[27379.10s -> 27382.44s]  He's gonna be in the next run. That's like john cena. Nice job you
[27382.76s -> 27385.80s]  You know, you're one of the most popular people in the wwe, but sorry
[27385.80s -> 27389.08s]  You never get to be in another rumble ever again. You sit these ones out
[27395.84s -> 27398.54s]  No, you do like
[27398.54s -> 27400.43s]  five to ten
[27400.43s -> 27403.95s]  People that were in previous rumbles. They're the people that I really like characters
[27403.95s -> 27407.15s]  I think are really fun and interesting and then you do like 10 to 20 new ones
[27408.19s -> 27410.75s]  And then some people don't even participate in the rumble
[27411.23s -> 27415.56s]  It's probably like five to ten new characters that show up just in the matches beforehand
[27416.51s -> 27423.47s]  I really like that system
[27423.47s -> 27429.48s]  And finally the buzzer for real dough. Thanks for 250 germa. Wait, I got a link to some possible fixes for prototype
[27430.12s -> 27432.76s]  Is there a mod I can pass the link on so they can give it to you?
[27434.00s -> 27438.80s]  Yeah, give it to one of the mods if not, it's I probably will
[27439.60s -> 27445.76s]  Honestly, let me just we'll we'll we'll say this right now. I'll probably just get it for xbox 360 if it exists for it
[27446.97s -> 27450.89s]  Some of these old games are just so finicky and by old
[27451.45s -> 27457.85s]  Anything more than eight to twelve years old just it can be such a pain in the ass if it's on a console
[27459.05s -> 27461.77s]  I just have to put the disk in and it just works and it won't
[27462.01s -> 27469.04s]  Crap well this game crashed like three times this game had like two bugs and hard crashed. This is a disk
