[0.89s -> 8.82s]  What's up? Good afternoon, how are you? We're a little early today, yeah. There's a reason for
[8.82s -> 17.98s]  that though. We are early because I wanted to pull the stream back to be able to do two different
[17.98s -> 24.86s]  things today. Originally it was going to be like a three hour stream in Jackbox, but I've decided
[26.84s -> 35.53s]  and well I was asked to play Trine. So there's going to be, starting now, there's going to be like
[36.49s -> 44.98s]  a couple hours, maybe two, three hours of Trine with Star and Ashley. And then Star and Ashley
[44.98s -> 52.97s]  are also going to join us for Jackbox. So I'll, this will be, this will not be a three hour stream.
[53.53s -> 63.90s]  Pulling it back lets us do both. But I do have to hard stop this stream between like 5 30 and
[63.90s -> 71.26s]  6 o'clock pacific, 6 30, maybe the latest. Because I have to, I have to leave. I have to get on an
[71.26s -> 91.08s]  airplane. I've got to go. This is the week. I have to prepare and I got to go. For what? Well,
[91.80s -> 99.00s]  it's funny that you asked. Nobody. I didn't even see it. The Halloween stream requires a lot more
[99.96s -> 110.46s]  setup and time. So I'm going into the studio and I'm going back east. Nobody asked.
[110.46s -> 116.25s]  The one paid actor did. Yeah, going back to the east coast. I'm going to visit some family and
[116.25s -> 125.21s]  friends while I'm there. Gives me an opportunity to be in Boston for a while and hang out. I'm
[125.21s -> 128.09s]  not going to stream to the Halloween stream. After today, there's not going to be a stream
[128.09s -> 136.30s]  until Halloween. Just to let you guys know, the Halloween stream is the next stream after this one.
[139.00s -> 148.33s]  Back, back to Boston. Here we go. But yeah, that's the plan and I believe we're kind of just ready
[148.33s -> 159.56s]  to go. Let's just see if we are. Hello. How is everybody doing? Hello. Hello. Not bad. Not
[159.56s -> 172.81s]  pretty good. All right. That's star and that's Ashley. They are star and Ashley. Power and
[172.81s -> 180.49s]  wisdom and what was the other one? Oh my God. Courage. Courage. I didn't know it. She never
[180.49s -> 187.13s]  told me. How am I supposed to know if my wife doesn't tell me? Unbelievable. Where do we leave
[187.13s -> 191.05s]  off? What did we do last time? I don't remember. Okay. So last time where we left off in the
[191.05s -> 196.17s]  three trainers, we definitely paid attention to the entirety of the plot. I think the nightmare
[196.17s -> 202.25s]  prince ran away from us because he didn't want to be locked in the castle and now we're chasing him.
[202.81s -> 207.93s]  Oh, that's right. We are chasing somebody. Yeah. The nightmare prince who's having these dreams
[207.93s -> 212.17s]  and his dreams are coming to life. And the only thing he dreams about are a wolf.
[214.57s -> 220.23s]  Does he really deserve our help? I know he is a prince. Well, I think our characters were
[220.23s -> 225.27s]  touching on that a little bit, like that we were wasting our time and that he was a snotty little
[225.27s -> 231.99s]  brat. And why do you guys care about honestly, I have the power to create boxes. You think I'm
[231.99s -> 236.23s]  going to waste my time on this kid? Dude, we already said it before. Last time we did the
[236.23s -> 244.47s]  three trainers for lore mega lol. You're the one that asked. Oh, did I? I mean, you said,
[244.47s -> 249.67s]  where did we leave off? I explained it. I did not just ask what, what? No, I said, well, like in,
[249.67s -> 254.63s]  like in the video game, like where did we leave off? Right here. Yeah. But then you started going
[254.63s -> 259.35s]  off on like the story and I started to get fucking tired. Where else, like where, what else would you
[259.35s -> 268.47s]  be asking? I don't know. Like what was the last puzzle we did? Who cares? You don't care about
[268.47s -> 274.55s]  the lore, but you care about the last puzzle we did. I don't know. What's the context? Remember
[274.55s -> 280.07s]  the wizard hall, like full of mirrors? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. You started talking about like
[280.07s -> 286.89s]  story and I started to get fucking tired. Oh, we got a wall here. Oh, right. Fighting.
[287.85s -> 291.13s]  There is fighting in this game. There's the wolf you're screaming about.
[292.33s -> 298.63s]  He also dreams of platforms a lot. Wolves. Why wolves though? Can somebody explain it to me?
[304.82s -> 310.47s]  My chat's saying that he's a furry. Probably right. Boston accent. There's a deer in the
[310.47s -> 315.59s]  background. You guys just ran by. Wait, are you skipping all the, we need these, don't we?
[317.11s -> 320.26s]  Yeah, rowdy. I got one.
[326.89s -> 330.89s]  Oh yeah. And then, then I was doing all the dialogue from my character and it was a lot of fun.
[332.41s -> 336.33s]  We had a really good time with that joke. This is a new mechanic and you talked over the whole thing.
[338.41s -> 345.78s]  Oh, it is a new mechanic. There's things. I can freeze that. Oh, oh, thank you. And then
[345.78s -> 350.58s]  I think you might have to, all right, put the box over there so she can get the, uh,
[351.86s -> 360.30s]  the droplet. She already has blood. Yeah, Jeremy's blood. Not what we leave. Okay. Uh,
[360.30s -> 368.06s]  one of us is locked out. His blood. Uh, shit. He just shoved it right in the perfect spot. Oh,
[368.06s -> 371.10s]  thank you. All right. I've got that and I'm going to cut you guys loose and you can go on the ride.
[371.10s -> 376.86s]  You ready? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Nice. Was that fun?
[379.34s -> 386.01s]  I sacrificed myself. You're missing the blood. Yeah, but I can't get that. You can get that.
[386.01s -> 393.88s]  I can't get that. Can I get that here? Stop Ashley. Stop hitting my box. I'm going to push
[393.88s -> 400.12s]  this. German watches the German watches the departed in Boston Red Sox baseball every day.
[401.00s -> 407.72s]  Um, you say that as a, you say that as a joke, but, uh, that's, I think that is like required
[407.72s -> 413.80s]  reading. If you live in Boston, like at least once every couple of years, that like is what
[413.80s -> 420.36s]  happens. I didn't, Oh, I didn't even freeze that. I was talking. We were having fun. Just jump up
[420.36s -> 428.49s]  here. Let's just get going. Yeah. Just get the blood. Hold on. The departed is amazing. Yeah.
[428.49s -> 432.97s]  Okay. Two boards. You didn't say it right though. You didn't put an A H in your,
[432.97s -> 438.84s]  in your word. It's the fucking deposit. And if you don't say the F word in the middle either,
[438.84s -> 444.20s]  you're dead. I know it's a true, I know who's a true Boston fan. If you don't say the fucking
[444.20s -> 451.70s]  deposit. I have no idea what you're talking about. Why was I trying to freeze that rock? Wait, wait,
[451.70s -> 455.54s]  wait, wait, wait. Take, you gotta take, you gotta take the boulder to the left to activate the
[455.54s -> 461.80s]  lotus signal. Should I freeze that? What about what's up there? But what's up there? I can do
[461.80s -> 470.33s]  this. See, I told you, I knew I was supposed to go up there. All right. So now how do you get over
[470.33s -> 484.54s]  there? Come with me. That works. Well, now when you need to block that. Oh, the fuck. Wait. Oh,
[484.54s -> 489.02s]  cause the boulder has to be over. Yeah. With your power, right? You do it and then you dash back.
[489.02s -> 496.28s]  Okay. I think I see these lamps are the fire. So if I light them, I just open the door. All right.
[496.28s -> 502.12s]  Nice. Yeah. Wow. All right. Fucking pot it. Nice. Oh yeah. That's where we left off. My character
[502.12s -> 507.40s]  can't do anything and I just make boxes and do everything. You got to remember that last time
[507.40s -> 517.64s]  we went over this. No, uh, we need to all get a boulder. I can do this. They're part of joke.
[518.44s -> 528.87s]  Plus two. How many elements did you hit? Oh, you got fucking destroyed. All right. I don't care.
[529.75s -> 543.19s]  I'm fine. My true strength is respawning. So I think we can, can we just all get up there?
[543.19s -> 547.77s]  If we jump from here to there. Uh, yeah, there's a lot of stuff. How do you get up there? You got
[547.77s -> 551.29s]  to go this way. When I got my upgrade points, I can't use
[556.01s -> 567.48s]  daddy. Help me. I can't. I don't know. Left, left, left. Well, that works. Left. I think that,
[567.48s -> 570.28s]  yep. Oh, there's a bunch of shit up here, isn't there? And there's a bunch of stuff up here.
[578.47s -> 583.19s]  Hold on. Maybe my box can solve this. If that, if that happened, that's seriously what happened to
[583.19s -> 591.03s]  you. She's just trying to kill it. Oh crap. Nope. Oh, okay. Well, we can do this without Ashley
[591.03s -> 597.83s]  stars. My real name is Danny. Mine. Yeah. Your real name is Danny. Oh, there's nothing there.
[597.83s -> 607.08s]  Right. Anyway, my real name is Jason Long, American dragon. Whoa, dude. Super boost.
[607.80s -> 627.67s]  My name is Ollie shot color. You blocked it. Was that a fortnight bus horn? I don't know. I've
[627.67s -> 635.21s]  never played it. Never. Not even the previous version. Um, does the PlayStation four version
[635.21s -> 639.93s]  count if I'm lying down on my side in bed, bringing a monitor into my bedroom to play
[639.93s -> 643.05s]  that game on the PS four, the regular original game for like 20 minutes.
[644.41s -> 648.76s]  Does that count? How about you? You hold your shield up for someone to jump on. How about you
[648.76s -> 661.38s]  do that? Well, you eat my ass. Well, I can freeze that. No, I'm just grandma. Just jump on it on the
[661.46s -> 669.62s]  jump on it. Please jump on me. Please. This is like the easiest. Oh, wait, I have to move.
[669.62s -> 676.90s]  You have to do it. Why is everybody yelling at me? Oh, no, no, pull it up. I can pull it up.
[677.54s -> 690.14s]  Pull it up. You have it there. Oh, my God. It's so easy. Okay. Get
[690.14s -> 698.65s]  it. Why is it activating? Wait, no, no, no, that that's how you do it. I'm not supposed to
[698.65s -> 703.45s]  be up here. Me being up here, fucks this whole thing up. Why did you tell me to go over here?
[703.45s -> 715.38s]  Put that back up there. Watch this. Okay, we did it. See, I just have to hang it. That was so easy.
[715.94s -> 719.70s]  God, then you're the leader. Glad you have a wizard. You think you're the leader.
[720.50s -> 726.50s]  Why can't we be friends and have fun? There is no leader. I have the biggest hat. We have a 33%
[726.50s -> 744.01s]  stake in this at all the same. Oh, my God. But I actually get 38% for hosting fees. And because of
[744.01s -> 748.25s]  the fire, I need my expenses for the fire. In fact, I probably like 42% because these are expensive.
[749.05s -> 764.68s]  Okay. 44% I think would be covered. All right, now what do I do? You gloat from up there.
[764.68s -> 774.68s]  I'll just take all of it. And then like, I'll give you guys like a little bit to like,
[778.50s -> 793.77s]  wait, I want all your shot. What is it doing? Why is it doing that?
[796.34s -> 803.94s]  Behold my power. I can now make balls. Do it. Wait, what can you do?
[806.26s -> 811.88s]  How do I do it? I made them bouncy too. It's a ball.
[812.60s -> 817.64s]  Wait, it said I unlocked bouncy balls. Wow. You just shaved off the corners of your boxes.
[819.56s -> 826.58s]  Great. Wow. That's what a power. You're just saving money.
[831.85s -> 836.98s]  Wait, I also learned I learned to blink, but it didn't tell me how to do it.
[837.70s -> 847.32s]  What a shift for me. Oh my god, I'm useful. I guess I have to spend these points.
[851.24s -> 857.46s]  Hey, he's using for an alt. So we don't all do the same alt. What do you mean? Because you get more
[857.46s -> 863.08s]  points than you can spend for your one character. So what are you guys using for an alt? There's we
[863.08s -> 871.08s]  don't have alt. I'm not doing that. You are the archer. Shut up and live with it. But okay,
[871.08s -> 877.48s]  can you get those blood? I'm just wait, you, you, you generate more experience points than you can
[877.48s -> 886.01s]  spend. What are you doing? I can do the worms. I'm supposed to bash this. Why would it? Oh, oh,
[886.01s -> 892.14s]  I think that wasn't a joke. There it is. I'm serious. I don't, I want to like, what if we need
[892.14s -> 899.42s]  to? I don't know. No, being serious. We can't switch characters. This is a, oh, well then this
[899.42s -> 905.48s]  is classic. Why does it give you extra points? Because you can play this single player and switch
[905.48s -> 910.92s]  for all three characters. I see. Okay. Well, we have to roll on your ball. Oh my god.
[912.84s -> 922.07s]  And I remain. Actually, just die. If we both die, we'll appear at him. Okay.
[926.42s -> 931.46s]  That's not working. You go forward. Go forward. You got, it's not working. I've been standing over
[931.46s -> 936.90s]  here this whole time. Come on. Keep going. What do you mean? I can't keep going. I need you.
[937.86s -> 946.46s]  I can't get this. See, I can't reach this.
[949.14s -> 954.58s]  Almost worked. Obviously now he appears over here. See. Maybe it has to be two people have to be
[954.58s -> 961.37s]  there. Possibly. These puzzles are going to get crazy once all our powers reach their maximum
[961.37s -> 964.65s]  potential and we're required. This looks too complicated. Let's just do Jackbox.
[967.21s -> 970.01s]  Now you have that in your back pocket. It's gonna be really annoying.
[970.81s -> 978.25s]  What? Playing Jackbox? Oh, I said it once. That's the first time I said it.
[979.05s -> 982.73s]  Well, you were thinking at the full plug. Hold on. It's hard to aim this
[983.45s -> 992.28s]  because it snaps. Okay. Now you should be able to get up there and then do the,
[993.66s -> 1001.13s]  yeah. Sick. Now drop a ladder. Drop a ladder. Now you, here we go.
[1002.46s -> 1006.22s]  You mean go on without you guys? Okay. Oh, so Daisy. Okay. Now I do that. Oh, shoot.
[1007.42s -> 1018.60s]  Wait, what? What's up there? Fireballs. Mega. Oh, what's up on the left? I don't know. What's
[1018.60s -> 1023.48s]  up this way? Oh, shit. What's up this way? I don't know. Let's find out. Oh, this place is full of
[1023.48s -> 1032.34s]  blood. I supposed to be here. Oh, you can't go up. It's a, you can, you can. I mean you can,
[1032.34s -> 1039.38s]  but I hit them. What did I hit? I got to hold my ball. Is that it? Yeah. Ashley didn't even
[1039.38s -> 1046.82s]  want to come up this way. Can we go apart? See if we can go apart. Oh, shit. Okay.
[1048.82s -> 1054.09s]  It's like the way to go. Where do you guys go? We're doing the secret bonus area.
[1054.09s -> 1063.00s]  The super difficult puzzle. It's not that difficult. It's extremely hard. It requires
[1063.00s -> 1071.48s]  three people. Oh, come on. We also got a talisman. You lied. Yeah, it was really hard.
[1074.55s -> 1083.88s]  The two triners. Hey. Just momentarily, momentarily the two triners. She's trying to kill us.
[1083.88s -> 1108.70s]  Can you make it through? Almost died. You have a way to do that. Okay. Bring it down here. No,
[1108.70s -> 1123.29s]  what are you doing? Almost. I'm keen to your bullshit now. That was a hard one. There's a big
[1123.29s -> 1128.49s]  one. There is a big one. We're going to go up top left. So when you said, when you were making the
[1128.57s -> 1141.35s]  joke that this is a hard one, it is you have to do this. Give me a box. Get a ball. Well,
[1141.35s -> 1145.91s]  I can't grab the edge of that. Okay. Well, that's my problem. You're going to make fun of how I
[1145.91s -> 1157.48s]  just shaved the edges off. I mean, that was pretty funny. All right. Now give me another one. All
[1157.48s -> 1170.95s]  right. Now. Oh, look at that. Oh, you got it. No. Come up here. Do you need me to drop this?
[1171.67s -> 1179.26s]  Are we good? We're good. We're good. Okay. We are the three triners. Oh, my God.
[1183.13s -> 1184.33s]  Incoming boss fight probably.
[1189.34s -> 1195.35s]  Wait, why are you guys so far off the screen? Because we kept going forward. I thought it was
[1195.35s -> 1209.67s]  a cut scene. And then you have to roll down there. Oh, now. Okay. Hold on. Now it presses the button
[1210.71s -> 1219.35s]  to get the stuff. Okay. What about here? Drop a drop a ball down the little area.
[1219.99s -> 1229.74s]  It's going to open this door. Cool. Dude, we're so smart. Somebody said, is this paper Mario?
[1230.70s -> 1246.20s]  Yeah. You know, I've never played paper Mario. Same. Have you? Have you never played either? No,
[1246.20s -> 1254.98s]  I'm not a Nintendo boy. I played it. Maybe. Oh, I'm just going to make. Can I make a
[1256.02s -> 1268.44s]  bridge to the ball? Probably. Why was it not rolling? I was walking. Oh, only one person
[1268.44s -> 1280.66s]  can roll it. Okay. Oh, play it right now. Hey, what? Play it right now. No, I'm not going to play
[1280.66s -> 1287.64s]  paper Mario right now. Okay. I've got a bridge. If you like Mario RPG, you should love paper Mario.
[1289.75s -> 1298.49s]  It's not that I don't like it. It's just not the same. Oh, nothing's the same. I know. I know.
[1303.37s -> 1307.77s]  Why do we just break all the boxes? Maybe you might think to yourself we could use that box.
[1307.77s -> 1312.01s]  Somebody just said it's better. You have infinite boxes in your butthole. But I can only have one
[1312.01s -> 1316.65s]  box. That was access to multiple boxes. There's a box slot. Look how high we have to climb. What if
[1316.65s -> 1321.53s]  we had a box right now? There's a box slot right there. No, not a ball slot, a box slot.
[1322.65s -> 1326.49s]  The less boxes we have, the more useful you are. Think about that.
[1326.49s -> 1334.76s]  What? Well, I'd still be the one moving the box. Yeah. Even if we have more boxes.
[1334.76s -> 1340.20s]  But I like your boxes better. It's a compliment. He hates trying to break these boxes.
[1341.72s -> 1347.00s]  The wizard like they're my friends. Like, please. It's not with the box breaking. I studied box
[1347.00s -> 1356.30s]  magic. No more. Don't kill any more boxes, please. They're so nice to be. Boxes don't get enough
[1356.30s -> 1360.38s]  respect around you. As an awful old man, boys, you can do better than that. I know you can.
[1360.38s -> 1367.82s]  Okay. That was even worse. Quite a treasure there. You have a natural cube.
[1371.26s -> 1378.04s]  Let me step in here for you. These boxes are so hard to control. If only I had my scrolls.
[1378.76s -> 1389.80s]  That's an old man's motto. Fuck my stomach. I can't laugh. I'm not supposed to be laughing.
[1390.68s -> 1395.16s]  I think it needs to be you, Jermis. You roll on the ball. The ball is currently...
[1395.96s -> 1407.96s]  I'll take care of it. Let me step in for you. No, no. No. Yes. There you go.
[1408.68s -> 1418.15s]  And you get a bridge. This looks so stupid. Why would I need a fucking ball? Get that
[1418.15s -> 1422.68s]  fucking ball out of here. Oh, my. I'm so... Hold on. I gotta calm down.
[1422.68s -> 1425.48s]  You have quite a treasure there in that Herodric ball.
[1425.48s -> 1428.68s]  I got so fucking angry right there. Why? Oh, my God. What's wrong?
[1430.52s -> 1433.32s]  Fucking God. Hold on. All right. Jeez. Slow down.
[1433.32s -> 1435.40s]  You did it. Hey, look at all these boxes.
[1436.12s -> 1438.04s]  Oh, I'm trying to... Get out of here.
[1442.89s -> 1447.37s]  You can do it. No, I'm not trying to jump on that. I'm trying to grab the thing.

[1533.93s -> 1543.90s]  We got it. Oh, points. I still can't. So, was it just a secret area? Yeah. Oh, pressure.
[1544.70s -> 1551.78s]  Yep. Can't go over there. Yeah. Trying to get out of here without the ball.
[1552.50s -> 1563.83s]  We're already both out. I meant like this way. Oh. Did it. Oh, did it too. Okay. Okay.
[1563.83s -> 1569.35s]  You made that sound like it was going to be way harder. Give it to me. Wait. There's another
[1569.35s -> 1579.02s]  thing to break. Oh, my God. It's running. It's running away. Get him back. All right. Now you

[1588.28s -> 1597.00s]  Okay. This is all you. Wait, me? Yeah. We, we died. Oh, my God.
[1601.83s -> 1611.24s]  Well, they did it. This game is way too easy. Um,
[1611.24s -> 1616.84s]  um, there's been a few challenging things so far. Yeah. What's the point of the game
[1616.84s -> 1622.28s]  if I can't brag about it on like Reddit after I beat it? Yeah. I only play games with like
[1622.28s -> 1633.45s]  2% completion rates. Oh, am I sticking the slot in the cube? Oh, the most powerful ball.
[1634.57s -> 1645.90s]  The moon. Okay. Oh, fights are meaningless. Yeah. It's like commentary on war.
[1647.10s -> 1661.19s]  Stop. Stop. Stop it. No more funny things. I'm supposed to be the funny one. You stop
[1661.19s -> 1668.94s]  making jokes. No, I like, I have like fucking side pain. Why do you guys think I played
[1668.94s -> 1672.46s]  Bushido blade last night? Cause there's no way it was going to be funny. And it was hilarious.
[1675.14s -> 1679.38s]  Yeah. He's on this whole new thing where he just wants to like not have fun anymore. All right.
[1679.38s -> 1688.17s]  Give it to that box. It's too much. It's too heavy. It's too heavy. All right. Now you got to
[1689.98s -> 1693.58s]  go on this one. You wait. I'm the lightest. Wait, I'm the lightest. Wait,
[1693.58s -> 1697.26s]  Triner telling you one more funny thing out of you and I'm out of this call.
[1700.70s -> 1705.13s]  See? All right. Now I can freeze it. That's good. No, it's good. Or whatever.
[1707.30s -> 1711.14s]  There's a hook over here. What is it? What's that hook for? What did, what just happened?
[1711.22s -> 1717.62s]  I think you just, did you cut my line? I did. I was pointing with my sword.
[1718.50s -> 1728.57s]  I pointed too hard. Yeah, almost. I think that's the cheater's hook. So you just skip the whole
[1728.57s -> 1739.58s]  thing. Kind of is, but cheaters or what? Uh, there's a little thing I can pull.
[1741.58s -> 1755.48s]  Pull it. What is this for? I don't understand the application here. Oh, to get us over.
[1756.20s -> 1764.97s]  Just to make it easy. Well, we can all get over. Oh, come on, dude. Nope. I'm your wife.
[1766.01s -> 1772.86s]  I'm your wife. Uh, statistically most murders happen with people that know each other.
[1774.90s -> 1781.78s]  Most husbands murder wives. Yeah. I'm saying like that's okay. You have to freeze this left one.
[1781.78s -> 1787.96s]  What I'm saying is they're going to catch it. What happened? You got to catch me first. All
[1787.96s -> 1792.12s]  right. So this, this is done. And then you got to put that up there. And then we put this one up
[1792.12s -> 1805.78s]  here that allows us to go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up 99% of husbands.
[1813.62s -> 1825.40s]  I just die. Yeah. How, what? Oh, you might have to freeze this one too. Jeremy. Okay.

[2781.87s -> 2786.68s]  400 square feet 300 square feet maybe just think about how far I had to go to

[3236.06s -> 3243.64s]  anything holy shit that was actually kind of scary there's another wall over
[3243.64s -> 3249.32s]  here need a ball need to launch that one up here somehow how do we open this
[3249.32s -> 3260.26s]  door though behind this wall there's an ice key to the left I think you might
[3260.26s -> 3265.94s]  need to make a rope bridge for me to put a ball on either that or this ball will
[3265.94s -> 3271.46s]  knock another ball forward I mean that's I don't think I can place balls on ropes
[3271.46s -> 3284.47s]  oh I can you can so I guess that is what you do so then now how do we push the
[3284.47s -> 3292.47s]  key like oh how do you oh you can pick them up
[3292.47s -> 3309.02s]  they're can't put down sword see hello well you don't try it and you try and do
[3309.02s -> 3319.40s]  it I mean you try and do it beg me there's no begging someone say
[3319.44s -> 3326.29s]  something nice about me put that key in that slot or you're gonna have an
[3326.29s -> 3331.17s]  incredibly angry fucking person here put it in your slot okay this joke is done

[3357.16s -> 3366.42s]  you money okay now so freeze it when it gets that's weigh it down freeze it we
[3366.42s -> 3371.10s]  need to break the ceiling so I think you need to make another rope that angles up
[3371.10s -> 3377.50s]  to launch a ball up I can't attach it to anything though unless you put like a
[3377.50s -> 3388.69s]  ball over here I can attach to like a to that it's pretty janky but it'll
[3388.69s -> 3400.55s]  probably work will it work just keep just keep doing it will happen it's I
[3400.55s -> 3412.71s]  think yeah no okay that what I did not make another ball we just we yeah yeah
[3412.71s -> 3422.78s]  we might need to swing the ball around the left one yeah we need to attach
[3422.78s -> 3433.45s]  that to the ball yeah so now you swing it like a pendulum yeah dude the three
[3433.45s -> 3445.04s]  Triners knew that that was testing everyone else oh okay all right bring
[3445.04s -> 3448.76s]  this night wait it's done can I just make a box every once in a
[3448.76s -> 3456.72s]  while demolish we did it the right way the way the gamer game makers intended

[3910.38s -> 3915.02s]  done and you do them very quickly and it kind of ruins the game but you do very
[3915.02s -> 3932.03s]  well going fast now now Ashley I like your haircut so hard it was that easy
[3932.07s -> 3944.02s]  little does he know hey this is too positive with the negativity I'd

[3948.40s -> 3950.40s]  house
[3973.95s -> 3982.47s]  all that crickets okay okay so the nightmare prince who summons wolves the
[3982.47s -> 3988.59s]  first place he ran to was a badger and now this looks like a porcupine 100%
[3988.59s -> 3993.07s]  nightmare prince is a furry no he's afraid of furries and that's why he's
[3993.07s -> 4002.58s]  tormenting right and break it why does what that other one what the first the
[4002.58s -> 4009.07s]  second one didn't break it what okay stop saying the word furry furry furry
[4009.11s -> 4017.71s]  what happened to Hillary's furries constant conflict I think I killed it

[4353.14s -> 4367.70s]  bounce think about my shield really hard nice Pontius just walks around
[4367.70s -> 4387.85s]  thinking about it in like ten years for somebody just wrote and I'm gonna make a
[4387.85s -> 4391.73s]  reference to this so you know like they said like five to ten years ago don't
[4391.73s -> 4395.33s]  don't put dumb shit on Facebook don't put it because like what if you go to a
[4395.33s -> 4398.45s]  job interview and they see it right that was like the thing they told us like ten
[4398.45s -> 4405.61s]  years ago in twitch chat now somebody just wrote I can't stop farting your
[4405.61s -> 4410.09s]  boss in ten years is gonna see that just just to make sure let you know so
[4410.09s -> 4424.74s]  careful yeah he will no one wants a gasser what do you mean how there's
[4424.74s -> 4445.42s]  times that I can't stop party no matter what and Ashley got hired they're gonna
[4445.42s -> 4457.65s]  know when you was scratching your ass last all right you're gonna pull that up
[4457.65s -> 4463.80s]  and like linked up I did see a story really recently about a guy that like
[4463.80s -> 4468.36s]  had done this really amazing charity thing like raised like $200,000 like got
[4468.36s -> 4472.72s]  his name on a beer can for this charity and then they felt like two tweets from
[4472.72s -> 4480.60s]  eight years ago like everyone took their money back what a good thing we raised
[4480.60s -> 4489.34s]  money for but then like put his face on like a beer can or something and the
[4489.34s -> 4495.95s]  beer guy didn't want that that tweet guy so watch those farts guys why don't talk
[4496.91s -> 4508.39s]  parts are fine yeah we gotta get the light I think I think okay wait wait
[4508.39s -> 4515.30s]  wait we shield right the boxes get off the box off over here and now I actually
[4515.30s -> 4526.47s]  stand on the boxes and dream shield it down down down yeah what would you do
[4526.47s -> 4531.66s]  without me chat won't moving so fast my boss won't see this germ is a furry in
[4531.66s -> 4534.46s]  In ten years your boss is gonna go, who the fuck is Jerma?
[4535.26s -> 4537.26s]  Is this somebody that you made up in your mind?
[4537.90s -> 4543.82s]  Is this supposed to be you? I see it. Also, you know, it's
[4544.62s -> 4549.20s]  285 times over the course of six months. You wrote bald idiot
[4550.18s -> 4552.18s]  Who's that a reference to?
[4552.18s -> 4555.98s]  Who's the bald idiot? Who's this? I don't understand this. Who is that? What's that for?
[4555.98s -> 4558.98s]  Well, after the copy was easy to find, just two more flowers to go.
[4558.98s -> 4560.98s]  Oh, we're looking for flowers.
[4561.50s -> 4563.75s]  Okay.
[4563.75s -> 4570.25s]  Where's flowers?
[4570.25s -> 4572.55s]  And then he- and then he-
[4572.55s -> 4578.47s]  You look at his head, and it's like there's a fucking giant M receding hairline on his head.
[4578.47s -> 4582.59s]  I just- what's that? What's that? What's that? Is that funny? Is there something funny there?
[4582.91s -> 4587.87s]  You're gonna have to dream shield over to the box. I think.
[4590.46s -> 4592.46s]  The plant is in that wall on the right.
[4593.06s -> 4598.38s]  So you need to dream shield towards the box so you can second shield it into the wall.
[4598.74s -> 4601.46s]  I don't think I could use the dream shield thing when I'm moving though.
[4601.46s -> 4604.58s]  My father was the baldest man on earth, and he created this company.
[4607.74s -> 4609.74s]  Think I'm gonna let that fly?
[4609.74s -> 4612.94s]  Yeah, I'm like hitting F. Nothing's happening.
[4614.10s -> 4618.98s]  Can we make a box like right here so I don't bounce or no?
[4619.54s -> 4622.22s]  Just keep doing that. I mean, it's hitting the plant. Is it hitting it?
[4623.02s -> 4631.53s]  This is stupid. I feel embarrassed. Look how dumb I look. I'm a fucking warrior. This is cool.
[4633.10s -> 4638.42s]  I feel like I should be able to grab a- no, wait, but I can grab and make a-
[4638.90s -> 4642.14s]  You can, yeah, you can make a rope across. This is what they want.
[4642.14s -> 4647.10s]  Yeah, but I can't move it when it's roped and people are jumping on it and it's flying into the sky.
[4648.22s -> 4651.54s]  So you're talking about like bang bang.
[4651.54s -> 4653.98s]  There we go.
[4653.98s -> 4655.98s]  Is it not good enough? There it is.
[4662.85s -> 4673.37s]  Hey future boss, I want to go to Chili's at 3 today.
[4673.77s -> 4678.17s]  Well, what if- what if you turn out to be- like people dig up things you said from Chili's-
[4678.17s -> 4680.17s]  Eww, eww, Chili's is disgusting.
[4681.17s -> 4687.61s]  And you are determined to be a bad person, so in the future when your boss sees that in the past the current employee called you bald,
[4687.61s -> 4690.77s]  they're happy that they made fun of you because in the future you're bad.
[4692.25s -> 4695.53s]  Yeah, what if you go to jail forever for like murder?
[4695.53s -> 4698.57s]  There was a Bruce Willis movie about this already. Next.
[4699.25s -> 4705.61s]  About people getting promoted for making fun of Bruce Willis?
[4706.09s -> 4724.81s]  No, maybe. I need to- come on. I need to move- I need to move this to here.
[4727.37s -> 4732.97s]  Thought I had to. And then that means we can go like this and then we can box it up.
[4732.97s -> 4734.97s]  I think this is fine.
[4734.97s -> 4752.70s]  Oof. Whoa, don't even need it. Wait. Oof.
[4752.70s -> 4755.62s]  Wait a minute.
[4755.62s -> 4757.62s]  That's cool.
[4757.62s -> 4761.27s]  I want to be able to make the plank.
[4761.95s -> 4764.19s]  Oh, come on.
[4764.19s -> 4766.19s]  You did forget a spell in your old age.
[4766.19s -> 4768.19s]  Ooh, I do have- do I have one?
[4768.19s -> 4770.62s]  What the hell?
[4770.62s -> 4774.06s]  Why does the archer get less shit than everybody else?
[4774.06s -> 4776.06s]  Hey! Hey, archer!
[4776.06s -> 4778.06s]  Come be useful.
[4778.06s -> 4784.65s]  Hey, archer!
[4784.65s -> 4791.67s]  Archer!
[4791.67s -> 4793.67s]  Here's a hook below you.
[4793.67s -> 4795.67s]  That works too.
[4795.67s -> 4801.67s]  You can solve problems in like seven different ways and you're mad that you don't have enough things.
[4802.35s -> 4806.51s]  I'm molding.
[4806.51s -> 4807.51s]  Stop.
[4807.51s -> 4809.51s]  Molding. Because molding.
[4809.51s -> 4811.51s]  Stop. You're giving them strength.
[4811.51s -> 4813.51s]  I like that. Correct.
[4817.51s -> 4824.87s]  Break this.
[4824.87s -> 4826.87s]  Okay, we're gonna find out that these are the Nightmare Prince's parents.
[4826.87s -> 4829.43s]  What, these barrels?
[4829.43s -> 4831.43s]  No, the badger and the-
[4831.43s -> 4833.43s]  The hedgehog?
[4833.43s -> 4836.76s]  Yeah.
[4836.76s -> 4844.76s]  That would be stupid.
[4845.44s -> 4847.44s]  Okay, do you want to play the wizard?
[4847.44s -> 4851.44s]  You know how annoying it is to try and make boxes where people need them but they stand where they want them?
[4851.44s -> 4854.26s]  Bald.
[4854.26s -> 4856.26s]  He must be bald.
[4858.82s -> 4861.31s]  You need me to move these?
[4861.31s -> 4863.55s]  Do you need another compliment?
[4863.55s -> 4865.55s]  Yeah.
[4865.55s -> 4869.90s]  I'll move it. I can do it.
[4869.90s -> 4871.90s]  You got a dream shield, the fucking light.
[4873.90s -> 4875.90s]  What light? Where is it?
[4875.90s -> 4878.46s]  On the right!
[4882.84s -> 4884.84s]  Box away.
[4884.84s -> 4886.84s]  Just do it straight forward.
[4886.84s -> 4888.84s]  What? What was that? Why did that happen?
[4888.84s -> 4892.23s]  That's pretty weird.
[4892.23s -> 4896.39s]  Don't stop. There you go.
[4896.39s -> 4898.39s]  I just made like dice.
[4898.39s -> 4900.39s]  On the dashboard.
[4903.85s -> 4905.85s]  You almost got it.
[4905.85s -> 4907.85s]  Come on.
[4907.85s -> 4909.85s]  No. Look, it worked.
[4909.85s -> 4911.85s]  The speedrun text.
[4911.85s -> 4913.85s]  Oh, look!
[4913.85s -> 4916.73s]  You got the prize.
[4917.41s -> 4921.12s]  I've never been happy.
[4921.12s -> 4923.12s]  I wake up with tears already in my eyes.
[4923.12s -> 4928.03s]  What the fuck?
[4928.03s -> 4930.03s]  I have to watch the bedding every day.
[4930.03s -> 4932.03s]  It keeps crying in it.
[4936.51s -> 4938.51s]  Okay, so let me...
[4938.51s -> 4940.51s]  Where's the water?
[4940.51s -> 4942.51s]  Oh, I don't need water. Double shield here.
[4942.51s -> 4944.51s]  And then you stand on my thing.
[4944.51s -> 4948.08s]  Daddy up.
[4948.08s -> 4950.32s]  Daddy!
[4950.32s -> 4952.32s]  Daddy upy!
[4952.32s -> 4958.85s]  Daddy look! Steve!
[4959.53s -> 4961.53s]  You can't do it that way, dude.
[4964.02s -> 4966.58s]  Here, can you stand on that?
[4971.96s -> 4973.96s]  I guess you need to bounce. You need to do double shield, don't you?
[4976.33s -> 4981.77s]  This isn't working.
[4981.77s -> 4983.77s]  It would work.
[4983.77s -> 4986.01s]  Look, if you just hang a box
[4986.01s -> 4988.63s]  from the ceiling.
[4988.63s -> 4993.05s]  I think.
[4993.05s -> 4995.29s]  I gotta get like...
[4995.29s -> 5000.97s]  There you go.
[5000.97s -> 5003.27s]  Now can you get up here?
[5003.95s -> 5006.70s]  Yeah, do that.
[5006.70s -> 5013.30s]  Yeah, I need something to jump on.
[5017.97s -> 5020.27s]  Every time I look over here
[5020.27s -> 5022.27s]  there's something else that I just see and I'm just like
[5022.27s -> 5024.27s]  I turn back.
[5024.27s -> 5026.70s]  My chat is upset
[5026.70s -> 5028.70s]  about double shield meta.
[5028.70s -> 5030.70s]  What? Why?
[5030.70s -> 5034.61s]  Because we were like cheating it before.
[5034.61s -> 5036.61s]  No, it's a reference
[5036.61s -> 5038.61s]  to a game in my room.
[5038.61s -> 5041.81s]  Oh.
[5042.49s -> 5044.49s]  No, that is not connected.
[5044.49s -> 5046.49s]  It looks like it is, but it's not.
[5046.49s -> 5050.01s]  It's not connected.
[5050.01s -> 5052.38s]  I mean, you're enough to jump over it.
[5052.38s -> 5054.38s]  What did it say?
[5054.38s -> 5058.98s]  Do I even need to say it?
[5058.98s -> 5066.58s]  Alright, now I go like this.
[5066.58s -> 5078.62s]  Dude, you're so good. Thanks.
[5078.62s -> 5080.62s]  Dude, you're so good. Go!
[5080.62s -> 5088.36s]  You're so good.
[5088.36s -> 5090.73s]  Why doesn't someone build a road?
[5090.73s -> 5094.18s]  I know, really.
[5094.18s -> 5096.55s]  I think we need some boxes.
[5096.55s -> 5102.76s]  I'm doing this to like pretend
[5103.44s -> 5105.44s]  I'm trying to play.
[5105.44s -> 5107.44s]  I'm trying to get, like, maybe if I hit it with my arrow
[5107.44s -> 5109.44s]  I'm secretly trying to hit it in the fucking head.
[5118.40s -> 5123.33s]  Oh, remember?
[5123.33s -> 5125.33s]  Last turn had like the fish level.
[5125.33s -> 5127.89s]  Didn't it?
[5127.89s -> 5129.89s]  There was a big ol' mean fishy.
[5129.89s -> 5131.89s]  Was there?
[5131.89s -> 5133.89s]  I don't think we ever completed the last one, did we?
[5133.89s -> 5135.89s]  I don't think we did.
[5135.89s -> 5137.89s]  I don't think so. We played it for like three and a half hours.
[5137.89s -> 5141.22s]  Tops.
[5141.22s -> 5143.22s]  Remember when that fisherman like carried Germa away
[5143.90s -> 5145.90s]  Hey, there's a big nut up here. Hold on, big nut.
[5145.90s -> 5147.90s]  Big nut.
[5147.90s -> 5149.90s]  I'm waiting for you to get that shit out of here so I can pull this.
[5149.90s -> 5153.35s]  Nevermind.
[5153.35s -> 5159.11s]  I don't even need you to do that.
[5159.11s -> 5161.48s]  Big nut.
[5161.48s -> 5168.52s]  Ooh, it's gonna fall.
[5168.52s -> 5179.40s]  That was a lot less dangerous than I thought it was gonna be.
[5179.40s -> 5187.32s]  Light.
[5187.32s -> 5189.32s]  I don't know how you don't block that.
[5189.32s -> 5191.32s]  What, if you stand on a box?
[5191.32s -> 5195.08s]  Like, can you...
[5195.08s -> 5197.08s]  But then the box will block it.
[5197.08s -> 5203.14s]  Uh, okay.
[5203.82s -> 5205.82s]  Yeah, do that, and then stand, and then make a box like here.
[5205.82s -> 5210.54s]  Do it.
[5210.54s -> 5212.54s]  And then stand on the box and make it so it doesn't block the light.
[5212.54s -> 5216.54s]  If I can get it in a position where you can do it.
[5216.54s -> 5218.54s]  What?
[5218.54s -> 5220.54s]  Like this.
[5220.54s -> 5223.17s]  There's no hooks or anything.
[5223.17s -> 5226.11s]  Oh. I thought it was secure.
[5226.11s -> 5228.11s]  Good intentions.
[5228.11s -> 5230.11s]  Hey, there it is. Almost.
[5230.11s -> 5232.11s]  Just move these forward.
[5232.11s -> 5234.67s]  I don't think so. No?
[5234.67s -> 5238.32s]  No.
[5239.00s -> 5243.54s]  I don't think...
[5243.54s -> 5245.54s]  Wait, hold on a second.
[5245.54s -> 5259.94s]  Can this be used for anything?
[5259.94s -> 5261.94s]  If it bounces that way,
[5261.94s -> 5263.94s]  you have to stand here somehow.
[5263.94s -> 5266.38s]  I think I know.
[5266.38s -> 5268.38s]  I think I know, I think I know, I think I know.
[5268.38s -> 5270.38s]  Okay, hold on, hold on.
[5270.38s -> 5272.38s]  Brain is going maximum capacity.
[5272.38s -> 5274.38s]  You need to make a dream shield...
[5274.38s -> 5276.38s]  Okay, get off the box.
[5276.38s -> 5278.38s]  You need to make a dream shield
[5278.38s -> 5282.79s]  while standing on top of this
[5282.79s -> 5284.79s]  that's pointing at the flower.
[5285.47s -> 5287.47s]  Right now.
[5287.47s -> 5290.86s]  And now you need to get down
[5290.86s -> 5292.86s]  and shoot it at the dream shield.
[5292.86s -> 5294.86s]  Reverse though.
[5294.86s -> 5296.86s]  Nice.
[5296.86s -> 5298.86s]  Awesome.
[5298.86s -> 5301.74s]  That's cool.
[5301.74s -> 5304.43s]  Pretty cool.
[5304.43s -> 5314.67s]  I think if you stick something to that...
[5314.67s -> 5316.67s]  Oh, never mind.
[5316.67s -> 5318.67s]  I think I can just get this one now.
[5318.67s -> 5321.81s]  Oh, I didn't see the...
[5321.81s -> 5323.81s]  I didn't see it up there.
[5323.81s -> 5326.18s]  Oh, I can unfreeze with my butt.
[5326.86s -> 5331.02s]  Oh, damn it.
[5331.02s -> 5333.32s]  Got it.
[5333.32s -> 5335.32s]  You know everything is solved with boxes.
[5335.32s -> 5337.82s]  What just happened to me?
[5337.82s -> 5348.62s]  Oh, sorry.
[5348.62s -> 5350.62s]  I did that on purpose because I wanted
[5350.62s -> 5352.62s]  just to explode.
[5352.62s -> 5357.91s]  Why are you pushing that?
[5357.91s -> 5359.91s]  Box on head or pre-recorded?
[5359.91s -> 5364.07s]  Hurry up and do it.
[5364.07s -> 5366.07s]  What's he doing with that big toothbrush?
[5366.07s -> 5368.07s]  This is too kind.
[5368.07s -> 5373.32s]  I can never thank you enough.
[5373.32s -> 5375.32s]  If you are looking for the nightmare prince,
[5376.00s -> 5378.00s]  I think he was headed towards the northern lakes.
[5386.56s -> 5388.56s]  We didn't have to help these people at all,
[5388.56s -> 5390.56s]  by the way.
[5390.56s -> 5392.56s]  The heroes took the hedgehog's advice
[5392.56s -> 5394.56s]  and followed a path leading to the west.
[5394.56s -> 5396.56s]  We could have been much faster if we just beat it out of them.
[5396.56s -> 5404.29s]  Alright.
[5404.29s -> 5406.78s]  Swim level, wee.
[5406.78s -> 5408.78s]  Oh my god, it's swim level.
[5408.78s -> 5410.78s]  Dude, Ashley.
[5410.78s -> 5412.78s]  This thing looks like you.
[5413.46s -> 5415.46s]  Where?
[5415.46s -> 5417.46s]  It's Otto.
[5417.46s -> 5419.46s]  Fuck you, dude.
[5419.46s -> 5430.79s]  What are you getting, Cal?
[5430.79s -> 5432.79s]  Oh.
[5432.79s -> 5437.72s]  I gotta make a signature.
[5437.72s -> 5441.88s]  Oh, yeah.
[5441.88s -> 5444.57s]  Break it. Snap it.
[5444.57s -> 5446.57s]  That's a big nut.
[5446.57s -> 5456.09s]  Ooh.
[5456.09s -> 5458.09s]  Does it have to be an acorn?
[5458.09s -> 5460.09s]  Use the fire arrow to activate
[5460.09s -> 5462.09s]  fire switches.
[5462.09s -> 5468.74s]  So it stays.
[5469.42s -> 5474.54s]  It's not like the freezing arrows.
[5474.54s -> 5477.55s]  Please make fire into the water.
[5477.55s -> 5479.55s]  Uh-oh.
[5479.55s -> 5483.70s]  Well, you gotta drain.
[5483.70s -> 5486.90s]  Flash is filling it.
[5486.90s -> 5489.58s]  She wants you to have more water.
[5489.58s -> 5496.05s]  Still can't upgrade anything.
[5496.05s -> 5498.93s]  Oh, Otto.
[5498.93s -> 5500.93s]  And it loves it.
[5500.93s -> 5502.93s]  Oh, it loves it.
[5502.93s -> 5506.38s]  Oh, let's pound it.
[5506.38s -> 5509.76s]  Oh, that's traumatizing.
[5511.76s -> 5515.92s]  Best part of the game.
[5517.92s -> 5519.92s]  Whoa.
[5519.92s -> 5521.92s]  This thing's brand new.
[5521.92s -> 5527.62s]  Dumbass.
[5527.62s -> 5529.92s]  Hahaha.
[5529.92s -> 5532.54s]  What?
[5532.54s -> 5536.45s]  What the fuck did you just say?
[5536.45s -> 5539.14s]  I said, got him.
[5539.14s -> 5546.30s]  Alright.
[5546.30s -> 5548.54s]  Fire has been activated.
[5548.54s -> 5550.54s]  Now we swim through this.
[5550.54s -> 5553.81s]  So the stupid swim.
[5553.81s -> 5556.50s]  How do you do that?
[5556.50s -> 5558.86s]  Through the tunnel.
[5558.86s -> 5570.11s]  Got it.
[5570.79s -> 5573.22s]  Oh, yeah.
[5573.22s -> 5575.22s]  He can do that.
[5575.22s -> 5577.22s]  I haven't had to do that move in like
[5577.22s -> 5579.22s]  six hours of gameplay.
[5579.22s -> 5581.22s]  So I forgot I could do that.
[5581.22s -> 5590.57s]  I remember.
[5590.57s -> 5593.06s]  Oh, yeah, he can do that.
[5593.06s -> 5595.06s]  He can also roll if he has it done.
[5595.06s -> 5597.37s]  Just walk forward so you don't stuff
[5597.37s -> 5599.99s]  on the plate.
[5599.99s -> 5605.74s]  Almost.
[5605.74s -> 5607.74s]  Okay.
[5607.74s -> 5609.74s]  Ball. On to help.
[5609.74s -> 5619.32s]  Good.
[5628.56s -> 5641.09s]  Fight.
[5653.02s -> 5655.02s]  Water into the wheel.
[5655.02s -> 5657.02s]  Water into the wheel.
[5679.36s -> 5681.36s]  There was a mermaid.
[5681.36s -> 5683.36s]  Oh, I wanna fuck.
[5683.36s -> 5690.53s]  Come fuck.
[5690.53s -> 5692.53s]  Alright, what's going on?
[5693.21s -> 5695.21s]  It's swimming away real fast.
[5695.21s -> 5697.21s]  Alright, fire over there.
[5697.21s -> 5699.21s]  Ice block.
[5699.21s -> 5701.21s]  Can I switch
[5701.21s -> 5703.21s]  abilities?
[5703.21s -> 5705.21s]  Before I get screamed at?
[5705.21s -> 5708.73s]  You can make that shot.
[5708.73s -> 5710.73s]  It's kind of hard because I have to
[5710.73s -> 5712.73s]  hold.
[5712.73s -> 5714.73s]  I have to hold the right
[5714.73s -> 5716.73s]  thumb thick.
[5718.73s -> 5720.73s]  The right thumb stick.
[5720.73s -> 5726.30s]  The right thumb tack.
[5726.98s -> 5728.98s]  Just compound us.
[5728.98s -> 5730.98s]  Let me get the pine cone on here.
[5730.98s -> 5732.98s]  Please.
[5732.98s -> 5734.98s]  He doesn't want to do it
[5734.98s -> 5736.98s]  the right way. He wants to do it the fast way.
[5736.98s -> 5740.88s]  I'm the person who
[5740.88s -> 5742.88s]  can lift these things and you keep fucking
[5742.88s -> 5744.88s]  jumping on it. I didn't do anything.
[5744.88s -> 5746.88s]  I'm pounding.
[5746.88s -> 5752.64s]  Now he wants to do two boxes.
[5752.64s -> 5754.64s]  I've seen this shtick
[5754.64s -> 5756.64s]  before. He wants two boxes over here for you to
[5756.64s -> 5761.44s]  jump on and skip the whole level.
[5761.44s -> 5767.39s]  I'm angry.
[5768.07s -> 5770.07s]  I'm not even close
[5770.07s -> 5772.07s]  to his balls.
[5772.07s -> 5774.07s]  I'm still mad.
[5774.07s -> 5776.70s]  Imagine how mad he is.
[5776.70s -> 5778.70s]  I actually may have more hair than you.
[5778.70s -> 5781.45s]  What?
[5781.45s -> 5783.45s]  Maybe.
[5783.45s -> 5785.45s]  We're going on a hair off.
[5785.45s -> 5787.45s]  My hair is higher quality.
[5787.45s -> 5789.62s]  I think it's higher to the ceiling too.
[5792.31s -> 5795.62s]  True.
[5795.62s -> 5797.62s]  Let's go to a hair salon and determine who has higher
[5797.62s -> 5799.62s]  quality hair.
[5800.30s -> 5802.30s]  I've been told I've got some fucking high
[5802.30s -> 5804.30s]  quality hair.
[5804.30s -> 5806.93s]  By who? Your mom?
[5806.93s -> 5808.93s]  Yeah, my mother said that.
[5808.93s -> 5811.62s]  Can you help me here?
[5811.62s -> 5813.62s]  Sounds like a mom compliment to me.
[5813.62s -> 5815.62s]  Will you put like a block on this?
[5815.62s -> 5820.02s]  Hey!
[5820.02s -> 5822.02s]  It's not my fault my blocks don't weigh enough
[5822.02s -> 5826.75s]  to satisfy you. Wait a minute.
[5826.75s -> 5832.38s]  Damn it.
[5832.38s -> 5834.38s]  If you're going to bring leg hair into this.
[5834.38s -> 5838.22s]  Hey, hello?
[5838.22s -> 5840.22s]  I don't know. Your legs are kind of scarred up
[5840.90s -> 5842.90s]  You have scars you don't grow hair.
[5842.90s -> 5844.90s]  Yeah, but the rest of my leg makes up
[5844.90s -> 5846.90s]  like I could probably make three sets
[5846.90s -> 5848.90s]  of Jerma's hair with a leg.
[5848.90s -> 5850.90s]  That's because your legs are so much longer than this.
[5850.90s -> 5856.66s]  Okay.
[5856.66s -> 5860.70s]  I mean, Jerma, honestly,
[5860.70s -> 5862.70s]  we were both able to do this.
[5862.70s -> 5864.70s]  Yeah, because you're putting boxes down
[5864.70s -> 5866.70s]  and you're talking about leg hair.
[5866.70s -> 5868.70s]  We get it. You got gross leg hair.
[5868.70s -> 5870.70s]  I do.
[5870.70s -> 5877.93s]  More of it.
[5877.93s -> 5880.62s]  Right in the car.
[5881.30s -> 5883.30s]  We got our puzzle.
[5883.30s -> 5885.30s]  Because everyone loves water levels.
[5885.30s -> 5888.11s]  You know what I'm saying?
[5888.11s -> 5896.48s]  I'm working.
[5896.48s -> 5900.96s]  Pull it down. Stand on it.
[5900.96s -> 5908.19s]  Oops.
[5908.19s -> 5912.67s]  I gotta freeze it.
[5912.67s -> 5918.50s]  Hold on.
[5918.50s -> 5920.50s]  Isn't that what we need?
[5920.50s -> 5922.50s]  Didn't we do it?
[5922.50s -> 5924.50s]  Yeah, now Jerma has to put the fire switch.
[5924.50s -> 5926.50s]  We did it.
[5926.50s -> 5928.50s]  Is it?
[5928.50s -> 5930.50s]  Shoot it.
[5931.18s -> 5933.18s]  Come on.
[5933.18s -> 5948.20s]  We did it.
[5948.20s -> 5955.93s]  Let's just leave.
[5955.93s -> 5960.15s]  Wait, is that the mermaid?
[5960.15s -> 5962.15s]  No. Oh my god.
[5962.15s -> 5967.08s]  I'm trying to shoot it.
[5967.08s -> 5970.26s]  You just crushed me.
[5970.26s -> 5972.70s]  Oh no, not Otto.
[5972.70s -> 5975.50s]  Bring it down.
[5975.50s -> 5978.06s]  Save Otto.
[5978.06s -> 5980.06s]  I'll save my own damn dog.
[5984.09s -> 5989.40s]  How's Otto doing? What's new with him?
[5989.40s -> 5991.40s]  What's in the news?
[5992.08s -> 5994.08s]  He's going to be a hot dog for Halloween.
[5994.08s -> 5996.08s]  Oh, that's a big surprise.
[5996.08s -> 5998.08s]  Yeah.
[5998.08s -> 6000.08s]  What the fuck?
[6000.08s -> 6002.08s]  This is somebody's arm.
[6002.08s -> 6005.02s]  It's a giant nightmare hand.
[6011.25s -> 6013.25s]  Okay, put it down here.
[6013.25s -> 6017.22s]  I need to jump on that to hit the flame.
[6017.22s -> 6019.22s]  Can you freeze the hand?
[6019.22s -> 6021.78s]  I tried it already.
[6021.78s -> 6023.78s]  I think we have to pull him forward and then I have to get up there.
[6024.70s -> 6028.54s]  Hmm.
[6028.54s -> 6030.54s]  I can't jump.
[6030.54s -> 6033.16s]  Put down another box so I can jump onto it.
[6033.16s -> 6035.16s]  What if I put the box here?
[6035.16s -> 6037.16s]  He breaks the box.
[6037.16s -> 6039.66s]  He's like, hey, fuck that box.
[6039.66s -> 6041.66s]  Oh, there we go.
[6041.66s -> 6044.98s]  Oh, you can do it.
[6044.98s -> 6046.98s]  Use the analog stick. Yeah.
[6046.98s -> 6048.98s]  Nice analog aiming.
[6048.98s -> 6050.98s]  Oh no, Otto.
[6050.98s -> 6059.69s]  I can just hold him, I think.
[6059.69s -> 6062.44s]  Then I have to...
[6062.44s -> 6065.75s]  What do we do with the water?
[6066.43s -> 6068.93s]  Get it out of here.
[6068.93s -> 6072.19s]  Water.
[6072.19s -> 6074.19s]  Oh my god, he's still holding onto him.
[6074.19s -> 6077.70s]  Worry.
[6077.70s -> 6084.80s]  Okay, that...
[6084.80s -> 6087.73s]  Hooray.
[6087.73s -> 6089.73s]  Yeah, that was just helping with that bubble.
[6089.73s -> 6095.04s]  You can now conjure a plank.
[6095.04s -> 6102.38s]  New shape. Pretty cool.
[6102.38s -> 6104.38s]  So much more advanced than a cube.
[6104.38s -> 6109.06s]  Wow.
[6109.06s -> 6111.81s]  You could not have done that without me.
[6111.81s -> 6117.46s]  Well, but now you're going to be like slightly annoying giant plank guy.
[6118.14s -> 6120.44s]  Giant plank, all right.
[6120.44s -> 6122.94s]  I know, it's already pretty annoying.
[6122.94s -> 6125.69s]  New letter.
[6125.69s -> 6131.96s]  That character can't read.
[6131.96s -> 6139.30s]  Anything down here?
[6139.30s -> 6143.90s]  I don't think so.
[6143.90s -> 6145.90s]  Steve!
[6145.90s -> 6148.33s]  What do you know?
[6148.33s -> 6150.33s]  He's throwing pool covers at us. Great.
[6150.33s -> 6152.33s]  He's declaring war is what he's doing.
[6152.33s -> 6154.33s]  Okay, here.
[6154.33s -> 6156.33s]  No, I gotta stand on this.
[6156.33s -> 6162.20s]  All right, guys.
[6162.20s -> 6164.38s]  How can a plank help?
[6170.10s -> 6173.74s]  All right, keep it.
[6173.74s -> 6176.43s]  What are you doing?
[6176.43s -> 6180.27s]  I don't know.
[6180.27s -> 6182.27s]  Okay, now I need...
[6182.27s -> 6184.27s]  Just jump up. Jump up and I'll elevator you.
[6184.27s -> 6187.54s]  Go!
[6187.54s -> 6191.12s]  Excellent.
[6191.12s -> 6196.50s]  They're dogs.
[6196.50s -> 6198.50s]  Yeah, I need to...
[6198.50s -> 6200.93s]  I'm gonna do this.
[6200.93s -> 6202.93s]  Nice.
[6202.93s -> 6205.55s]  Let's synchronize with the ball.
[6205.55s -> 6208.75s]  Anything up there?
[6208.75s -> 6211.12s]  Mister.
[6211.80s -> 6213.80s]  All right, stop.
[6213.80s -> 6215.80s]  You're hurting Otto.
[6215.80s -> 6217.80s]  No.
[6217.80s -> 6220.81s]  You just hit him in the head twice.
[6220.81s -> 6226.10s]  I can't.
[6226.10s -> 6228.10s]  Hold on.
[6228.10s -> 6230.86s]  I need to get on...
[6230.86s -> 6233.29s]  Okay, go ahead.
[6233.29s -> 6242.70s]  Now do the thing you were just doing.
[6242.70s -> 6245.26s]  How come this puzzle isn't solved yet?
[6245.26s -> 6251.14s]  I don't know.
[6251.14s -> 6253.14s]  I gotta phrase it. Phrase. Phrase.
[6253.14s -> 6263.00s]  Move, you thing.
[6263.00s -> 6265.88s]  I think this is a life lesson.
[6266.56s -> 6271.23s]  Just need a couple of boxes and it's pretty much it.
[6271.23s -> 6274.18s]  Okay.
[6274.18s -> 6276.42s]  Oh, balls are on.
[6276.42s -> 6278.42s]  I got a new upgrade.
[6278.42s -> 6280.42s]  Oh, you did? Well...
[6280.42s -> 6284.51s]  I'm trying to understand how to use it.
[6284.51s -> 6287.78s]  Wait, what?
[6287.78s -> 6290.14s]  Can get another upgrade.
[6290.14s -> 6292.96s]  Oh, this is the bouncy ball.
[6292.96s -> 6294.96s]  Oh, it's adorable.
[6294.96s -> 6298.54s]  Can we bounce it around together? Oh, that's cool.
[6298.54s -> 6302.38s]  I'm like ice farts.
[6302.38s -> 6314.35s]  I don't understand how this one works.
[6314.35s -> 6316.35s]  I should be able to push you off.
[6317.03s -> 6319.40s]  This thing doesn't make any sense.
[6319.40s -> 6322.41s]  It says, okay, okay, okay.
[6322.41s -> 6329.41s]  One conjuring an object, keep holding down left or right until the super throw is loaded.
[6329.41s -> 6333.41s]  I can't summon a ball or anything while holding down that button.
[6333.41s -> 6335.78s]  I'm gonna just hit.
[6335.78s -> 6343.95s]  Oh.
[6343.95s -> 6346.26s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[6348.56s -> 6350.56s]  Did you just push me off?
[6350.56s -> 6355.10s]  I mean, all we need right now is a couple of boxes.
[6355.78s -> 6357.78s]  Hold on, I'm trying to figure out my thing.
[6357.78s -> 6361.78s]  Here, take your stupid boxes and just solve.
[6361.78s -> 6363.78s]  I mean, there's not much to solve.
[6363.78s -> 6365.78s]  We just have to jump from jump to jump.
[6365.78s -> 6367.78s]  If I make another one, that one's gonna disappear now.
[6367.78s -> 6372.58s]  Oh, it didn't.
[6372.58s -> 6377.06s]  Okay.
[6377.06s -> 6379.06s]  What? What?
[6379.06s -> 6381.06s]  Oh, the spikes are coming through the plank.
[6381.06s -> 6383.06s]  I have fucking no shoes on.
[6383.06s -> 6385.06s]  Oh my god.
[6385.06s -> 6389.61s]  No, no.
[6389.61s -> 6391.61s]  Whatever, go forward.
[6392.29s -> 6394.29s]  I'll teleport.
[6394.29s -> 6396.29s]  Doesn't matter. Didn't happen.
[6396.29s -> 6403.71s]  We got a fight coming up here.
[6403.71s -> 6406.72s]  I can't figure it out.
[6406.72s -> 6409.73s]  So it's just a bouncy...
[6409.73s -> 6412.54s]  It's a bouncy ball.
[6412.54s -> 6414.54s]  Now, I've had the bouncy ball for a while.
[6417.17s -> 6419.17s]  Yeah, I didn't know how to activate it.
[6419.17s -> 6423.17s]  But now it's when I have something over my head, I'm supposed to be able to shoot it forward.
[6423.17s -> 6430.02s]  But the buttons don't make any sense.
[6430.02s -> 6435.07s]  Another water puzzle coming up here.
[6435.75s -> 6442.14s]  I'm gonna draw the object you want.
[6442.14s -> 6444.14s]  We'll see if I draw the object.
[6444.14s -> 6446.70s]  I draw a square.
[6446.70s -> 6448.70s]  I'm holding down left click.
[6448.70s -> 6450.70s]  And the moment I let go, the box is made.
[6450.70s -> 6454.70s]  But in order to throw it forward, it's saying to keep holding down left.
[6454.70s -> 6456.70s]  But I can't keep holding it down because I just fucking made it.
[6456.70s -> 6458.70s]  And I let go of left to make it.
[6458.70s -> 6462.70s]  But if I pick up an object, like I have this object and I hold down left, nothing happens.
[6462.70s -> 6464.70s]  You lost me. You lost me at like...
[6464.70s -> 6466.70s]  Hey, are you in the Discord?
[6466.70s -> 6468.70s]  Just start streaming.
[6469.38s -> 6471.38s]  Nothing's happening.
[6471.38s -> 6473.38s]  Honey.
[6473.38s -> 6480.80s]  Can I have a plank?
[6480.80s -> 6483.49s]  Little bit more to the right.
[6483.49s -> 6485.49s]  Little bit more.
[6485.49s -> 6487.49s]  Yeah.
[6487.49s -> 6489.49s]  Yeah.
[6489.49s -> 6491.92s]  Honey.
[6491.92s -> 6493.92s]  But this time it goes down there.
[6493.92s -> 6496.16s]  And there.
[6496.16s -> 6498.91s]  Look at that.
[6498.91s -> 6506.85s]  Hey, Koryn.
[6506.85s -> 6510.74s]  I think we can go up here.
[6510.74s -> 6518.29s]  There's a spike there.
[6518.97s -> 6520.97s]  Now how do we get up there?
[6520.97s -> 6524.68s]  Another one? Another rock?
[6524.68s -> 6534.58s]  Yep.
[6534.58s -> 6536.58s]  Cool. It was a big one.
[6536.58s -> 6538.58s]  It's right click. I've held right click.
[6538.58s -> 6540.58s]  I'm holding right click to pick this up right now.
[6540.58s -> 6542.58s]  It says release right click and it'll shoot.
[6542.58s -> 6547.58s]  I'm holding left click.
[6547.58s -> 6549.58s]  Like nothing it says is true.
[6549.58s -> 6551.58s]  Do you remember what a pine cone is?
[6551.58s -> 6553.58s]  And it says when conjuring an object.
[6553.58s -> 6555.58s]  So I can press Q to conjure this?
[6555.58s -> 6558.20s]  Or hold on.
[6558.20s -> 6560.20s]  I can press...
[6560.88s -> 6565.04s]  Which one is...
[6565.04s -> 6567.04s]  I forgot what button the box is.
[6567.04s -> 6569.04s]  Press F to hold left click.
[6569.04s -> 6571.04s]  Then once I hold left click I'm fucking moving it.
[6571.04s -> 6573.04s]  Nothing about this.
[6573.04s -> 6575.04s]  I'm just trying to get over to the other side.
[6575.04s -> 6577.04s]  Okay, there we go.
[6577.04s -> 6579.04s]  I have to hold left click and not on it.
[6579.04s -> 6581.04s]  And then it primes it in a random spot.
[6581.04s -> 6583.04s]  Okay, we figured it out.
[6583.04s -> 6585.04s]  Steve, they're all accusing you
[6585.04s -> 6587.04s]  of being bald the longer this rank goes on.
[6587.04s -> 6589.60s]  No.
[6589.60s -> 6600.02s]  I'm good.
[6610.41s -> 6612.41s]  You guys need help?
[6612.41s -> 6614.41s]  Fuck, no. I just did this.
[6614.41s -> 6625.40s]  Pipe incoming.
[6625.40s -> 6627.40s]  Wait a minute, but how do we block that?
[6627.40s -> 6629.40s]  So I can shoot the arrow.
[6629.40s -> 6631.40s]  I understand. Like if I pick up a box I can't launch it ever.
[6631.40s -> 6633.40s]  Because I have to do it when I conjure it.
[6633.40s -> 6635.40s]  Why is this moving like this?
[6635.40s -> 6639.24s]  How?
[6639.24s -> 6648.57s]  You can't even kill it.
[6648.57s -> 6650.57s]  I mean, it's fun.
[6650.57s -> 6652.57s]  Right now the star is in his own server
[6652.57s -> 6654.57s]  shooting bots.
[6654.57s -> 6661.03s]  Hello?
[6661.71s -> 6663.71s]  Hello? Can you hear me?
[6663.71s -> 6665.71s]  Yeah.
[6665.71s -> 6667.71s]  Okay. My mom was calling me.
[6667.71s -> 6669.71s]  I'm sorry.
[6669.71s -> 6671.71s]  You hung up on her?
[6671.71s -> 6673.71s]  No, she was calling me to come down for dinner.
[6673.71s -> 6676.72s]  So.
[6676.72s -> 6683.06s]  That's a lie.
[6683.06s -> 6685.06s]  Okay, now I'm going to shoot that.
[6685.06s -> 6687.06s]  Oh, no, I can't.
[6687.06s -> 6689.06s]  Can someone get rid of this bouncy ball?
[6689.06s -> 6714.14s]  I don't know. Maybe we should ask the wizard.
[6714.14s -> 6716.14s]  Get this ball out of here. Come on.
[6716.14s -> 6718.14s]  I like the balls a lot. I'm sorry.
[6718.82s -> 6720.82s]  Do you have a rock concert?
[6720.82s -> 6725.56s]  Is there a beach ball flying around?
[6725.56s -> 6728.25s]  No.
[6728.25s -> 6741.56s]  Oh, boss. Boss.
[6741.56s -> 6743.99s]  Boss prince.
[6743.99s -> 6747.45s]  Look at him moping.
[6759.45s -> 6761.45s]  You have to kill yourself.
[6765.94s -> 6767.94s]  So he's a bad guy.
[6767.94s -> 6770.94s]  Nothing.
[6773.30s -> 6775.30s]  No.
[6775.30s -> 6777.30s]  My mentor.
[6785.48s -> 6787.48s]  So we have to fight the
[6787.48s -> 6789.48s]  three of them at the same time.
[6789.48s -> 6791.48s]  The three gay dads.
[6791.48s -> 6793.48s]  How do we do this?
[6793.48s -> 6795.48s]  Wait, these are your three dads?
[6796.16s -> 6798.16s]  And we're all Pontius?
[6798.16s -> 6800.16s]  Why?
[6800.16s -> 6802.59s]  I don't even know how to play.
[6802.59s -> 6804.59s]  How do you do the dash?
[6804.59s -> 6806.83s]  Oh, shit.
[6806.83s -> 6808.83s]  I think we should bounce back his big ball
[6808.83s -> 6810.83s]  at our dad.
[6810.83s -> 6812.83s]  Oh, now is when the upgrades would matter.
[6812.83s -> 6817.18s]  I guess.
[6817.18s -> 6819.18s]  They switched me to a different Pontius.
[6819.18s -> 6821.18s]  That's stupid.
[6821.18s -> 6829.50s]  Oh, we got a launch.
[6829.50s -> 6831.94s]  Watch the top left.
[6831.94s -> 6836.22s]  Can we pick that up?
[6836.90s -> 6838.90s]  Yeah, I bet you guys wish you had a bouncy ball right now.
[6838.90s -> 6841.46s]  He just broke our shields.
[6841.46s -> 6846.58s]  Oh, shit.
[6846.58s -> 6848.58s]  I kind of do.
[6848.58s -> 6852.04s]  This is kind of messy.
[6852.04s -> 6854.04s]  We've got to get rid of their forcefields first.
[6854.04s -> 6858.95s]  Oh.
[6858.95s -> 6863.05s]  He's going to throw it.
[6863.05s -> 6865.48s]  Oh, that was a bad idea.
[6865.48s -> 6870.86s]  Oh, you have to dash and hit him.
[6870.86s -> 6872.86s]  Honestly, he's the strongest dad.
[6872.86s -> 6875.61s]  Daddy, why?
[6875.61s -> 6883.08s]  Watch the left.
[6883.08s -> 6885.08s]  No, we were too tall. He was too tall.
[6885.76s -> 6891.89s]  Oh, fuck.
[6891.89s -> 6896.18s]  Where did I go?
[6896.18s -> 6898.18s]  I don't even know where I am.
[6898.18s -> 6900.18s]  Oh, yeah. Dead.
[6900.18s -> 6902.18s]  Steve, you're alive.
[6902.18s -> 6904.80s]  Rez.
[6904.80s -> 6906.80s]  I just rezzed into a sword in the head.
[6906.80s -> 6909.87s]  Where's the heals?
[6909.87s -> 6917.74s]  Focus now.
[6917.74s -> 6920.11s]  Wait, I was alive?
[6920.11s -> 6925.94s]  Geez, we beat the shit out of them.
[6925.94s -> 6927.94s]  Oh, my God.
[6927.94s -> 6929.94s]  Look at that hot dad pile.
[6929.94s -> 6932.11s]  Fucking dead.
[6932.79s -> 6935.42s]  You know, we're not saving a prince.
[6935.42s -> 6937.42s]  Celius is turning into a villain.
[6937.42s -> 6939.42s]  And you know what we do with villains.
[6939.42s -> 6941.42s]  Zoya is right.
[6941.42s -> 6943.42s]  If we can't save the prince,
[6943.42s -> 6945.42s]  we're going to have to fight him.
[6945.42s -> 6947.42s]  We're going to bring him to court.
[6947.42s -> 6949.42s]  Well, geez, you just slaughtered your whole family.
[6949.42s -> 6951.42s]  Hello?
[6951.42s -> 6953.42s]  You have a problem? Hello?
[6953.42s -> 6955.42s]  Dude, heaven.
[6955.42s -> 6957.42s]  Crackling Maya.
[6957.42s -> 6959.42s]  Distressed by their last encounter with Celius,
[6959.42s -> 6961.42s]  the heroes continued their dogged pursuit
[6962.10s -> 6964.10s]  into the wild woodlands.
[6964.10s -> 6966.10s]  As night grew closer,
[6966.10s -> 6968.10s]  there was no sight nor sound
[6968.10s -> 6970.10s]  of Celius.
[6970.10s -> 6972.10s]  And the heroes found themselves
[6972.10s -> 6976.64s]  dreadfully lost.
[6976.64s -> 6979.14s]  Oh, no.
[6979.14s -> 6983.79s]  What? What are you doing?
[6983.79s -> 6986.61s]  I'm trying to start the level.
[6986.61s -> 6992.62s]  No.
[6992.62s -> 6994.62s]  It screwed up all our characters.
[6994.62s -> 6996.86s]  What do we do now?
[6996.86s -> 6998.86s]  What's the tool?
[6998.86s -> 7000.86s]  Instead of pursuing,
[7002.55s -> 7004.55s]  what is Jackbox?
[7004.55s -> 7009.59s]  Where's Jack?
[7009.59s -> 7012.15s]  Where's Jack?
[7012.15s -> 7022.65s]  Where's Jack?
[7022.65s -> 7024.65s]  Here, speedrun. We don't need the extra objectives anymore.
[7024.65s -> 7026.65s]  We don't have all our attribute points.
[7026.65s -> 7028.65s]  It's speedrun time.
[7028.65s -> 7031.27s]  Fine.
[7031.27s -> 7034.47s]  Fine. All right, fine.
[7034.47s -> 7037.16s]  It's time to observe
[7037.16s -> 7039.16s]  our place across the quest
[7039.16s -> 7041.16s]  and whatever she's saying.
[7041.16s -> 7043.16s]  The ground is made out of electricity.
[7043.16s -> 7045.40s]  Step on it! Let's go!
[7051.40s -> 7056.46s]  Jump into any ponds after strange ladies.
[7056.46s -> 7058.46s]  Oh, and that's electrified as well
[7058.46s -> 7060.82s]  because it's in the electricity.
[7060.82s -> 7062.82s]  Is that electrified? No.
[7062.82s -> 7066.86s]  That's wood.
[7066.86s -> 7068.86s]  That's electrified.
[7068.86s -> 7070.86s]  I'm just so used to jumping on stuff.
[7070.86s -> 7073.86s]  I know.
[7073.86s -> 7076.30s]  No longer electrified. Can I freeze it?
[7076.30s -> 7079.62s]  No.
[7079.62s -> 7081.62s]  You did it double power. You made it twice as more powerful.
[7081.62s -> 7083.62s]  Oh my god, I can kill you guys so easily now.
[7083.62s -> 7086.25s]  You always could.
[7086.25s -> 7088.62s]  I know.
[7089.30s -> 7098.06s]  Power was in the all along. Up top.
[7098.06s -> 7109.06s]  Oh, that didn't work.
[7109.06s -> 7111.06s]  We're just going fast now.
[7113.06s -> 7115.06s]  Jerma said I was good at going fast.
[7115.06s -> 7117.06s]  Yes, you are.
[7117.06s -> 7119.06s]  I didn't say the two of us were either.
[7119.06s -> 7121.06s]  Time for me to shine.
[7121.06s -> 7123.06s]  Race, race, race.
[7123.06s -> 7125.06s]  It's electricity.
[7125.06s -> 7127.06s]  I'm jumping in it.
[7127.06s -> 7131.60s]  Well, what do we...
[7131.60s -> 7136.98s]  Hold up, hold up, hold up.
[7136.98s -> 7138.98s]  Get off of it.
[7139.66s -> 7141.66s]  Oh my god, guys. Please get off of it.
[7141.66s -> 7143.66s]  Ashley, please get off.
[7143.66s -> 7146.41s]  You're...
[7146.41s -> 7148.84s]  Okay.
[7148.84s -> 7150.84s]  Okay. Pretty good.
[7150.84s -> 7152.84s]  Nice work.
[7152.84s -> 7154.84s]  You have to shoot the rope.
[7154.84s -> 7161.30s]  Shoot the rope.
[7161.30s -> 7164.82s]  Something happened.
[7164.82s -> 7166.82s]  You need to build a boat.
[7166.82s -> 7169.19s]  Ow!
[7169.19s -> 7171.19s]  That didn't look electrified.
[7171.19s -> 7173.19s]  I don't think we can get over this.
[7173.19s -> 7178.36s]  Build a what?
[7179.04s -> 7181.04s]  I thought you didn't want to collect these anymore.
[7181.04s -> 7183.73s]  Well, you guys were...
[7183.73s -> 7186.48s]  I was waiting for you to shoot the rope for like an hour.
[7186.48s -> 7189.42s]  Like a full hour.
[7189.42s -> 7191.42s]  How do we open this?
[7191.42s -> 7197.50s]  Oh, the connection needs to be met.
[7197.50s -> 7199.50s]  Right?
[7199.50s -> 7201.50s]  Pull the box out of the way.
[7201.50s -> 7203.68s]  You have to rope it again, I think.
[7203.68s -> 7206.88s]  Just lift up the box.
[7206.88s -> 7208.88s]  No, no, no. Get it out of the way.
[7208.88s -> 7212.34s]  Tell me what to do again.
[7212.34s -> 7214.34s]  I'll come to your house and say hello.
[7214.34s -> 7216.64s]  I'll say hi.
[7224.98s -> 7227.78s]  What?
[7227.78s -> 7230.92s]  I died inside of this thing.
[7230.92s -> 7234.44s]  That thing explodes.
[7234.44s -> 7239.56s]  That's a full party life.
[7239.56s -> 7242.57s]  Shit.
[7242.57s -> 7251.34s]  That's bullshit. I have plate mail.
[7251.34s -> 7253.34s]  I'm going to freeze the guy that's electrified.
[7253.34s -> 7255.34s]  He's causing all the problems.
[7255.34s -> 7259.10s]  There's the duck.
[7259.10s -> 7262.22s]  Ooh!
[7262.22s -> 7267.53s]  Two ropes at the same time.
[7267.53s -> 7269.53s]  That's so cool. How do I do two ropes at the same time?
[7269.53s -> 7271.53s]  I can use two ropes at the same time.
[7271.53s -> 7273.53s]  Okay.
[7275.15s -> 7277.15s]  Get it out of the way.
[7277.15s -> 7279.70s]  Me and Ashley are going over.
[7279.70s -> 7282.38s]  What are you doing?
[7282.38s -> 7285.71s]  We're going over.
[7285.71s -> 7287.71s]  That's really cool that you have two ropes.
[7287.71s -> 7289.71s]  We're going over.
[7289.71s -> 7304.74s]  Whatever.
[7304.74s -> 7306.74s]  It's so hard to tell.
[7306.74s -> 7309.68s]  It is.
[7309.68s -> 7311.68s]  Do I have a wood plank anywhere?
[7311.68s -> 7320.26s]  No, I don't.
[7320.26s -> 7322.69s]  Can you plank us?
[7322.69s -> 7324.69s]  They get electrified.
[7324.69s -> 7326.69s]  Anything I do gets electrified.
[7327.67s -> 7329.67s]  Even the bouncy ball.
[7329.67s -> 7331.67s]  Maybe the bouncy ball doesn't bounce.
[7331.67s -> 7334.42s]  You need a rubber.
[7334.42s -> 7337.88s]  It is rubberized.
[7337.88s -> 7340.89s]  It's only science.
[7340.89s -> 7342.89s]  This is hard though.
[7344.89s -> 7346.89s]  That was almost a full party life.
[7346.89s -> 7348.89s]  That was almost a full party life.
[7348.89s -> 7352.09s]  Without respawn timers.
[7352.09s -> 7354.09s]  At least somebody got up there.
[7356.09s -> 7358.09s]  That's definitely what you have to do.
[7358.09s -> 7360.26s]  I think we only need one of these
[7360.94s -> 7362.94s]  and the second one is causing a problem.
[7366.94s -> 7368.94s]  I was grabbing the edge.
[7368.94s -> 7370.94s]  I made it.
[7370.94s -> 7373.25s]  We have to be safe.
[7373.25s -> 7375.25s]  Move over.
[7375.25s -> 7381.57s]  I got a link.
[7381.57s -> 7383.87s]  Does that have to stay there?
[7383.87s -> 7386.11s]  What is it doing?
[7386.11s -> 7388.11s]  It's opening the door.
[7388.11s -> 7392.53s]  Is it?
[7392.53s -> 7395.02s]  It is.
[7395.02s -> 7397.02s]  The top door is opening.
[7397.70s -> 7399.70s]  Can you grab that wood plank?
[7399.70s -> 7405.53s]  There's a wood plank up there on the left.
[7407.53s -> 7409.53s]  He got too close.
[7409.53s -> 7418.49s]  Hold on.
[7418.49s -> 7422.26s]  I wish I could unsummon things.
[7422.26s -> 7425.59s]  I got that out of the way.
[7425.59s -> 7432.44s]  It's everywhere.
[7432.44s -> 7434.44s]  Every time I try to move something
[7434.44s -> 7436.44s]  someone touches it.
[7436.44s -> 7438.44s]  I want to die too.
[7438.44s -> 7442.22s]  I could have made it.
[7442.22s -> 7444.71s]  I'm stuck here.
[7444.71s -> 7446.71s]  You made it up there.
[7447.39s -> 7449.39s]  I can't freeze it.
[7449.39s -> 7451.39s]  Please stop touching my wood.
[7451.39s -> 7453.39s]  I'm touching your wood.
[7453.39s -> 7455.39s]  Now walk forward.
[7470.95s -> 7472.95s]  Watch that connection.
[7472.95s -> 7476.86s]  Why did I not grab the edge?
[7476.86s -> 7478.86s]  Pull it up.
[7478.86s -> 7481.22s]  Just launch me.
[7481.22s -> 7483.96s]  What?
[7483.96s -> 7486.52s]  The door is not open.
[7486.52s -> 7491.32s]  It is.
[7491.32s -> 7493.32s]  This box was slightly not there.
[7494.00s -> 7496.00s]  Have fun you two.
[7496.00s -> 7499.01s]  Get to a place where I can die.
[7499.01s -> 7503.68s]  Quietly.
[7503.68s -> 7505.68s]  You come across.
[7505.68s -> 7507.68s]  One at a time.
[7507.68s -> 7512.67s]  Very fast.
[7512.67s -> 7515.81s]  We're so good.
[7515.81s -> 7524.00s]  Maybe even the best.
[7524.00s -> 7541.33s]  That was slick.
[7545.33s -> 7548.02s]  What's this for?
[7548.02s -> 7550.02s]  Secret?
[7550.02s -> 7552.02s]  I was told no secrets.
[7552.70s -> 7554.70s]  No secrets.
[7554.70s -> 7556.70s]  Look at you trying to get secrets.
[7556.70s -> 7558.70s]  That wasn't a secret.
[7558.70s -> 7560.70s]  That was just trying to get the thing.
[7560.70s -> 7562.70s]  Trying to get the thing?
[7562.70s -> 7564.70s]  Oh my God.
[7564.70s -> 7566.70s]  Remember if another streamer
[7566.70s -> 7568.70s]  does a terrible joke
[7568.70s -> 7570.70s]  it's not my fault.
[7570.70s -> 7572.70s]  You endorse everything we say.
[7572.70s -> 7574.70s]  Just by us being here.
[7574.70s -> 7576.70s]  They just don't like when you do it.
[7576.70s -> 7578.70s]  Now they don't.
[7579.38s -> 7581.38s]  What now?
[7581.38s -> 7583.38s]  Now I'm going to freeze
[7583.38s -> 7585.38s]  this one.
[7585.38s -> 7587.38s]  Ball.
[7587.38s -> 7589.38s]  Give me that ball.
[7589.38s -> 7591.38s]  I'm going to sneak this way.
[7591.38s -> 7593.94s]  You froze it.
[7593.94s -> 7597.07s]  You're good.
[7597.07s -> 7599.31s]  I'm going.
[7599.31s -> 7601.31s]  They're trying to kill us.
[7601.31s -> 7613.79s]  Wait.
[7613.79s -> 7618.27s]  Wait.
[7618.27s -> 7622.43s]  Why would we wait?
[7622.43s -> 7628.38s]  Oh my God.
[7630.26s -> 7632.26s]  The whole screen is death right now.
[7632.26s -> 7634.26s]  Don't break that barrel.
[7634.26s -> 7637.53s]  I'm paying you to never make that joke again.
[7637.53s -> 7641.05s]  I've got a few more.
[7641.05s -> 7644.89s]  I think you can just
[7644.89s -> 7647.06s]  I can just do this.
[7647.06s -> 7649.06s]  No. This.
[7649.06s -> 7651.06s]  No. This.
[7651.06s -> 7656.76s]  I want to grab the...
[7656.76s -> 7660.41s]  No.
[7660.41s -> 7662.41s]  Maybe we need more weight up here?
[7662.41s -> 7664.41s]  That's a thing.
[7664.41s -> 7666.41s]  Get that box off there.
[7666.41s -> 7672.54s]  Oh God.
[7673.22s -> 7675.58s]  Hey.
[7675.58s -> 7688.18s]  I'm over here.
[7688.18s -> 7691.44s]  You can ice block.
[7691.44s -> 7693.44s]  The ice doesn't seem to be frozen.
[7693.44s -> 7695.44s]  We can't make that jump though. We need a box.
[7695.44s -> 7697.44s]  The ice doesn't seem to be frozen.
[7697.44s -> 7699.44s]  The box is frozen.
[7699.44s -> 7701.44s]  The box is frozen.
[7701.44s -> 7703.44s]  If you do that
[7703.44s -> 7707.34s]  that works.
[7707.34s -> 7709.34s]  Now we just have to figure out how to go from here to there.
[7709.34s -> 7713.70s]  Probably with
[7713.70s -> 7717.22s]  a box maybe?
[7717.22s -> 7719.78s]  A ball?
[7720.46s -> 7724.28s]  Wait a minute.
[7724.28s -> 7726.28s]  I think we can do this.
[7726.28s -> 7729.03s]  Hold on.
[7729.03s -> 7731.03s]  What?
[7731.03s -> 7736.58s]  Why did that happen?
[7736.58s -> 7738.58s]  You know what we got to do.
[7738.58s -> 7742.04s]  You know what it's time for.
[7742.04s -> 7744.04s]  That's what I just said.
[7744.04s -> 7746.22s]  That didn't work.
[7746.22s -> 7748.22s]  Start it over.
[7748.22s -> 7750.84s]  Wait.
[7750.84s -> 7753.14s]  Give me another one.
[7753.14s -> 7758.84s]  Come on. Give me that.
[7758.84s -> 7761.59s]  It doesn't bounce that high.
[7762.27s -> 7764.27s]  This is the worst thing in the world.
[7764.27s -> 7766.27s]  I thought it was going to bounce high.
[7766.27s -> 7773.68s]  It's certainly not what they want you to do.
[7773.68s -> 7776.05s]  It's certainly not what they want you to do.
[7776.05s -> 7778.67s]  Come on. This will work.
[7778.67s -> 7780.67s]  I definitely have to make a...
[7780.67s -> 7782.67s]  Put a box over here.
[7782.67s -> 7784.67s]  Not on the ice.
[7784.67s -> 7786.67s]  Put a box on the ice.
[7786.67s -> 7788.67s]  I can just do this.
[7788.67s -> 7790.67s]  Why did you die?
[7790.67s -> 7799.42s]  Something funky going on.
[7799.42s -> 7801.73s]  Game?
[7801.73s -> 7803.73s]  Now that's safe.
[7804.41s -> 7807.10s]  Just launch one of us up there.
[7807.10s -> 7811.90s]  Okay.
[7811.90s -> 7813.90s]  Yoink.
[7813.90s -> 7817.16s]  We got it.
[7817.16s -> 7822.09s]  Just solve it with box physics.
[7822.09s -> 7824.84s]  Do we need that ball for anything?
[7824.84s -> 7826.84s]  I guess not.
[7826.84s -> 7830.10s]  Probably.
[7830.10s -> 7844.95s]  This guy's got to go.
[7844.95s -> 7846.95s]  Skellington.
[7846.95s -> 7848.95s]  Those things can destroy my ropes.
[7848.95s -> 7850.95s]  Those things can destroy my ropes.
[7850.95s -> 7852.95s]  Those things can destroy my ropes.
[7852.95s -> 7854.95s]  Just block those holes.
[7855.63s -> 7861.52s]  No.
[7861.52s -> 7863.82s]  I just saved my...
[7863.82s -> 7865.82s]  Okay.
[7865.82s -> 7867.82s]  Just do rope, rope, rope.
[7867.82s -> 7869.82s]  Get this box out of the way.
[7869.82s -> 7871.82s]  It targets the box.
[7871.82s -> 7873.82s]  I can't destroy the box.
[7873.82s -> 7875.82s]  Okay.
[7875.82s -> 7877.82s]  There's that one.
[7877.82s -> 7879.82s]  I can do another one from here to there.
[7879.82s -> 7882.51s]  From here to there.
[7882.51s -> 7885.07s]  I don't know if that helps.
[7885.07s -> 7889.30s]  There you go.
[7889.30s -> 7891.30s]  Do bouncy balls.
[7891.98s -> 7893.98s]  Okay.
[7893.98s -> 7895.98s]  I can go across.
[7895.98s -> 7902.82s]  Just block both the holes.
[7902.82s -> 7904.82s]  Okay.
[7904.82s -> 7908.28s]  Okay.
[7908.28s -> 7911.35s]  Oh my god.
[7911.35s -> 7913.35s]  Okay.
[7913.35s -> 7915.35s]  I made it.
[7915.35s -> 7917.53s]  Good.
[7917.53s -> 7919.53s]  I think this is the result we were looking for.
[7919.53s -> 7926.18s]  I just can't die.
[7926.18s -> 7928.18s]  Just keep going.
[7928.18s -> 7930.18s]  I died.
[7930.18s -> 7932.18s]  It's impossible.
[7932.86s -> 7935.81s]  If I do this...
[7935.81s -> 7937.81s]  I can make that.
[7937.81s -> 7943.57s]  I can't make that.
[7943.57s -> 7946.45s]  How did that work?
[7946.45s -> 7948.45s]  Okay. I'm going to shit my pants.
[7948.45s -> 7951.39s]  I already did.
[7951.39s -> 7955.09s]  Same.
[7955.09s -> 7957.09s]  I need to shoot the one below.
[7963.41s -> 7966.93s]  Did I get it?
[7966.93s -> 7969.23s]  Where am I?
[7969.23s -> 7973.84s]  I'm currently still alive.
[7973.84s -> 7976.85s]  How did I end up back here?
[7976.85s -> 7982.61s]  Things are getting goofy, guys.
[7983.29s -> 7991.98s]  They are.
[7991.98s -> 7993.98s]  There has to be a button to unsummon.
[7993.98s -> 7998.06s]  I can't.
[7998.06s -> 8000.06s]  They're stuck.
[8000.06s -> 8003.58s]  I need to cut this.
[8003.58s -> 8005.58s]  Let me get this thing out of here.
[8005.58s -> 8007.88s]  Get that ball out of here.
[8007.88s -> 8012.23s]  It's attached still.
[8012.23s -> 8015.43s]  It has a rope on it in the back.
[8015.43s -> 8017.80s]  It shouldn't have any ropes.
[8017.80s -> 8019.80s]  I think it's wanting you to go under the bottom.
[8019.80s -> 8023.32s]  Attach to the thing on the top.
[8023.32s -> 8025.32s]  It's electrified.
[8025.32s -> 8027.32s]  Yeah.
[8028.00s -> 8030.00s]  Rope from these.
[8030.00s -> 8033.20s]  And swing to the other side.
[8033.20s -> 8040.56s]  Do you understand?
[8040.56s -> 8046.13s]  Hold on.
[8046.13s -> 8048.75s]  I have to have it be small.
[8048.75s -> 8051.31s]  I can now ride it all the way across.
[8051.31s -> 8053.31s]  Now you have a lever.
[8053.31s -> 8068.53s]  Pull it!
[8068.53s -> 8070.53s]  Don't destroy this.
[8070.53s -> 8072.53s]  I guess they just explode when they touch lightning.
[8072.53s -> 8074.96s]  I think they just exploded in general.
[8074.96s -> 8076.96s]  It's a little electrified.
[8076.96s -> 8082.98s]  You can rub it.
[8082.98s -> 8084.98s]  There's a rope.
[8085.66s -> 8087.66s]  It's sticky.
[8087.66s -> 8094.42s]  Very sticky.
[8094.42s -> 8097.11s]  Now we're getting high level.
[8097.11s -> 8099.11s]  That's not electrified.
[8099.11s -> 8103.34s]  Which one should I freeze?
[8103.34s -> 8105.34s]  Left one?
[8105.34s -> 8108.60s]  Sure.
[8108.60s -> 8110.60s]  If you can.
[8110.60s -> 8112.60s]  I think you can just get over here.
[8112.60s -> 8115.80s]  There's a safe spot.
[8115.80s -> 8118.62s]  There's a safe spot right over there.
[8118.62s -> 8120.92s]  Okay.
[8120.92s -> 8122.92s]  I can just launch someone.
[8122.92s -> 8124.92s]  Oh God.
[8125.60s -> 8130.02s]  Hold on.
[8130.02s -> 8133.98s]  Yep.
[8133.98s -> 8137.82s]  I can just hold on.
[8137.82s -> 8140.51s]  Now you don't have to worry.
[8140.51s -> 8142.51s]  Now you're safe.
[8142.51s -> 8157.47s]  Okay.
[8157.47s -> 8159.90s]  Enjoy your Kinect.
[8159.90s -> 8164.77s]  You get to play Kinect.
[8164.77s -> 8174.24s]  C-O-N-N-E-C-T.
[8174.24s -> 8176.24s]  Working for a second. Can you freeze?
[8176.24s -> 8178.24s]  We got to wait for this to come around
[8178.24s -> 8181.18s]  and it's going to work.
[8181.18s -> 8187.78s]  Oh my God.
[8187.78s -> 8190.98s]  Jerma!
[8191.66s -> 8193.66s]  Where are we?
[8193.66s -> 8196.02s]  Can you freeze the top thing?
[8196.02s -> 8198.02s]  No.
[8198.02s -> 8200.02s]  I said no as I pressed it
[8200.02s -> 8202.02s]  and did it.
[8202.02s -> 8205.10s]  No.
[8205.10s -> 8214.25s]  It breaks the eye.
[8214.25s -> 8223.38s]  Do it.
[8223.38s -> 8227.22s]  What? Now it's not breaking.
[8227.22s -> 8229.72s]  You have to electrify the top one.
[8229.72s -> 8231.72s]  Like that.
[8231.72s -> 8233.72s]  It broke last time though.
[8233.72s -> 8239.48s]  What?
[8239.48s -> 8241.48s]  Maybe because we didn't compliment you enough.
[8242.16s -> 8249.95s]  That was fun.
[8249.95s -> 8251.95s]  Jerma shot it, did he?
[8251.95s -> 8253.95s]  Did he ruin the whole thing?
[8253.95s -> 8255.95s]  I don't think he did.
[8255.95s -> 8258.45s]  Oh, she's pregnant.
[8258.45s -> 8260.45s]  What the fuck?
[8260.45s -> 8262.45s]  What?
[8262.45s -> 8265.65s]  The fuck?
[8265.65s -> 8274.03s]  Are you talking about?
[8294.69s -> 8296.69s]  What do we got for a time?
[8296.69s -> 8298.69s]  It was currently 3 o'clock.
[8298.69s -> 8300.69s]  Pacific.
[8300.69s -> 8302.69s]  Do you want a jack?
[8302.69s -> 8304.86s]  It might be jack time.
[8304.86s -> 8306.86s]  Did it jack off?
[8306.86s -> 8309.42s]  No.
[8309.42s -> 8311.42s]  What?
[8311.42s -> 8313.42s]  Jerma has it pre-scheduled every day.
[8313.42s -> 8315.42s]  Now that he's changed stream schedules,
[8315.42s -> 8317.42s]  it's messing with us a bit.
[8317.42s -> 8319.42s]  His house is full of alarm clocks
[8319.42s -> 8321.42s]  and they all go off.
[8321.42s -> 8323.42s]  3, 4, 3.30, 3.10.
[8325.79s -> 8328.42s]  Time to jack.
[8328.42s -> 8330.42s]  The next time anybody dies,
[8330.42s -> 8332.42s]  we move on.
[8332.42s -> 8334.42s]  The next time anybody dies,
[8334.42s -> 8336.42s]  we move on to jack box.
[8336.42s -> 8338.42s]  He's about to jump off the mat.
[8338.42s -> 8340.42s]  Try as hard as you can.
[8340.42s -> 8343.10s]  I guess we're in for another fishing camp.
[8348.86s -> 8350.86s]  Okay.
[8350.86s -> 8355.26s]  I'm trying so hard.
[8355.26s -> 8357.26s]  There we go.
[8357.26s -> 8365.90s]  Freeze it.
[8366.58s -> 8369.59s]  Fight.
[8369.59s -> 8375.86s]  I don't want to see any deaths here.
[8375.86s -> 8392.10s]  I got you.
[8392.10s -> 8394.10s]  Why is that frozen?
[8394.10s -> 8397.62s]  It has the fairy rope.
[8397.62s -> 8399.62s]  When attaching a rope to a loose object,
[8399.62s -> 8404.42s]  keep holding down.
[8404.42s -> 8407.05s]  Keep holding down.
[8407.05s -> 8410.55s]  What does that mean?
[8410.55s -> 8412.55s]  Tie the rope to the hook.
[8412.55s -> 8414.55s]  I can just walk it?
[8414.55s -> 8416.55s]  Can you get your ball out of the way?
[8416.55s -> 8418.55s]  I can't because people keep walking on it
[8418.55s -> 8420.55s]  and getting stuck on things.
[8421.23s -> 8426.67s]  I don't understand.
[8426.67s -> 8428.67s]  What did that rope do?
[8428.67s -> 8430.67s]  Hold on.
[8430.67s -> 8432.67s]  It just pulls it up.
[8432.67s -> 8434.85s]  So no matter what,
[8434.85s -> 8436.85s]  it's going to pull.
[8436.85s -> 8438.85s]  It looks like he just intentionally walked to his death
[8438.85s -> 8440.85s]  because he wants the jack.
[8440.85s -> 8442.85s]  Jack box.
[8442.85s -> 8445.28s]  That's right.
[8445.28s -> 8447.46s]  It's time.
[8447.46s -> 8450.66s]  Who knew that Germa would die first?
[8450.66s -> 8452.66s]  Who knew that Germa would die first?
[8452.66s -> 8454.66s]  I was just trying to work it out.
[8455.34s -> 8460.65s]  I was just trying to work it out.
[8460.65s -> 8462.65s]  All right.
[8462.65s -> 8464.65s]  Jack box party pack six.
[8464.65s -> 8466.65s]  You guys don't need it.
[8466.65s -> 8470.36s]  I don't think anybody needs it but me, right?
[8470.36s -> 8472.36s]  That's how it was traditionally.
[8472.36s -> 8474.36s]  I think we just need the website
[8474.36s -> 8476.36s]  and the code.
[8476.36s -> 8478.36s]  So don't give out the code on stream.
[8478.36s -> 8480.36s]  No, no, no.
[8480.36s -> 8482.36s]  You're pretty amateur.
[8482.36s -> 8484.36s]  No, I have sub discord.
[8484.36s -> 8486.36s]  I don't put it in the stream.
[8486.36s -> 8488.36s]  Give it to us.
[8489.04s -> 8491.04s]  I'm not in your sub discord.
[8491.04s -> 8493.41s]  I've been subbed to you
[8493.41s -> 8495.41s]  for like seven years.
[8495.41s -> 8497.65s]  I've never taken it off.
[8497.65s -> 8501.68s]  All right, let me switch.
[8501.68s -> 8503.68s]  Just give me one second.
[8503.68s -> 8505.68s]  All right, give me a sec.
[8505.68s -> 8507.68s]  Everybody take like a break.
[8507.68s -> 8509.68s]  How about like a two minute, three minute break?
[8509.68s -> 8511.68s]  Go pee, get some water.
[8511.68s -> 8515.65s]  And when you come back, jack box will be going strong.
[8515.65s -> 8517.65s]  Sounds good. Be right back.
