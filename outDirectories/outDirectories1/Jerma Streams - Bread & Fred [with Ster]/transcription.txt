[0.44s -> 19.61s]  Bread and Fred. Bread and Fred. I'm turn your volume down. I'm glad I did because the splash
[19.61s -> 28.10s]  screen is very loud. Yep. Oh, yeah. Turn your volume down. I'm glad I caught that. It is very
[28.10s -> 52.92s]  loud. Uh, should I play this with a controller? Jesus. What the fuck? I'm trying to turn it down
[52.92s -> 68.46s]  and it went up. What just happened? Hold on a second. Why? Hey, I got, I got a limiter on
[68.46s -> 73.93s]  everything that comes through. Don't worry. I have a limiter on everything that comes through now.
[73.93s -> 80.92s]  So that was loud, but that wasn't unbelievably loud. Don't worry. I put it on there. All right.
[80.92s -> 90.10s]  How you feel? Hey, how you doing there? Hey, pal. What's going on there, pal? Hold on. What do you,
[90.10s -> 96.17s]  what resolution are you playing at? What do you, what do you, what? Hey, what resolution,
[96.17s -> 105.03s]  what resolution are we playing at? Yes. You can do five. What is 5120 by 2160? What the hell is
[105.03s -> 135.83s]  that? A projector? 5K resolution. All right. Let me capture this. Hey, there it is. Okay. This game
[135.83s -> 142.04s]  is Torturous Chat. Uh, it's a co-op platformer where we're tied together. I don't, I haven't
[142.04s -> 145.88s]  played it. Haven't seen it played, but I know that it is going to require coordination between
[145.88s -> 153.21s]  me and you to succeed. So it is going to be torture. Okay. So how do we get in a game together?
[155.53s -> 161.24s]  You click play and then it says multiplayer. Okay. Should I, do you want to host? Do you want me to
[161.24s -> 165.96s]  host it? Uh, I'll, I'll host again. Make sure there's not like a room code before we, we show it.
[168.14s -> 174.30s]  My screen is hidden. There's no room code. It's a steam invite. I've sent you the steam invite.
[174.30s -> 180.25s]  I have. Ooh. All right. Are we good? There's no like, oh, there we go.
[180.25s -> 191.62s]  Waiting for your partner. Yeah. You got to press space to confirm for some reason. Oh, so okay.
[191.62s -> 198.78s]  I'm Fred. You're Fred. I'm bread. Is a mod here? Can they change the game to Fred and Fred? Hey,
[198.78s -> 208.70s]  can that mod come over to my channel and do the same? Don't do that. Okay. So how does it work?
[208.70s -> 215.26s]  I'm going to plug a controller in for sure. Okay. So I'm the red one and how do you move?
[217.05s -> 228.26s]  WASD is working for me. It's, it's arrow keys for me. Oh, numpad with your, with your coffee.
[228.26s -> 249.51s]  I'm using controller. Uh, do you know what a fulcrum is? Yes. Oh, you played Q. Why is WASD not
[249.51s -> 256.23s]  working? And I, this controller not work either for this game. Everything's fine for me. What the
[256.23s -> 263.85s]  heck? Um, that's weird. Uh, I guess I'm doing arrow keys. Is it that hard? No, it's not that
[263.85s -> 273.03s]  difficult. It's fine. Okay. Oh, our ping is at the top. It's funny. So let's just jump and walk.
[273.59s -> 283.61s]  Is there any other buttons? Not that I've noticed. I don't know what this is. I think this is where
[283.61s -> 288.23s]  you get your collectibles or something. Oh, we got it. We got to go climb the mountain. How did
[288.23s -> 295.03s]  you just do that? Do what? You were like holding on because we're always holding on. All right.
[295.03s -> 301.34s]  Well, get up here. We have to time this by the way. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. This is going
[301.34s -> 307.82s]  to be torture. How do you, from, from there, can I like pull you up? It doesn't, it does not appear.
[307.82s -> 315.27s]  So, okay. So what? No, no, no, don't just do that. Are we going to, are we going to have to count
[315.27s -> 322.95s]  down for every jump? Yes. So that's how it works. Ready? Do you want to go like, go or do you want
[322.95s -> 330.07s]  it to be like one, two, three? How do you want to do this? Uh, uno, dos, tres. Okay. So you want,
[330.07s -> 341.22s]  we have to get the same thing. Ready? Uno, dos, tres. On three. Oh, I can swing. Uno, dos, tres.
[341.22s -> 347.27s]  Uno, dos, tres. Only one of us. Okay. Only one of us should do it. We need something better than
[347.27s -> 358.23s]  that. I'm telling you. I, I say what we're going to do is now jump and on jump. No, no, no, no, no,
[358.23s -> 362.87s]  no, no, no. No, cause if you do one, two, three, then you're adding 33% more gameplay time.
[363.59s -> 376.34s]  Yeah. But if we, if we, if it just simply just is now jump, now jump, see now jump. Can I swing
[376.34s -> 387.58s]  you up here? Maybe. All right. Just one, two, three. No comedy dog shit. One, two, three. One, two,
[387.58s -> 398.10s]  three. One, two, three. Oh, it's Charlie. Review some of the key points. The most important one is
[398.10s -> 405.46s]  swinging. One of you needs to be an anchor. That doesn't even work for me because it's down.
[407.14s -> 418.07s]  And then you swing. Okay. Okay. Don't fall. Okay. So let's go up here. Let's test that out. So I'm
[418.07s -> 424.63s]  going to, I'll come over here. One, two, three. So I'm going to anchor and then you go down.
[424.63s -> 434.28s]  What happens if I do that? So you can swing and get yourself up here. I think at some point,
[435.24s -> 443.24s]  Oh, if I let go, you need to stand up and then we need to both. We're not getting past like the
[443.24s -> 454.06s]  first jump. There's no way in this room. Okay. Coffee anchor. All right. Okay. Now we need,
[454.06s -> 462.66s]  we need to both jump here. All right. One, two, three. One, two, three. Okay. Here's here. You're,
[462.66s -> 470.84s]  I'm going to anchor. You're going to swing. And then when you're coming back. Okay. Wait, wait,
[472.60s -> 485.75s]  Hey, I'm going to go for it. Okay. Apparently you need to go more up. One, two, three. One, two,
[485.75s -> 492.54s]  three. Okay. I'm anchoring now. So you want me, when you go up there, I jump when I'm swinging
[492.54s -> 503.26s]  like that. All right. You just kind of, I'm going to anchor and you find yourself. I can't,
[503.26s -> 507.58s]  I can't hear. I've got to move. No, German come down. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[507.58s -> 510.94s]  We can watch, make this jump without an anchor. We have to practice the anchor. Cause it's going
[510.94s -> 521.19s]  to be, there's going to be a jump up here. We're going to lose. It's one, two. What are you doing?
[521.19s -> 527.19s]  Don't kind of like, all right. One, two, three. You have to keep the same timing the whole time.
[527.19s -> 541.94s]  One, two, three. Yeah. Can you, no, I can kind of like pull you. Oh, you have to make the jump.
[541.94s -> 556.18s]  Okay. You need to swing more than that. So bad at this. We need to count. You don't just sense me.
[556.18s -> 565.46s]  We're not like close enough that we can just sense. One, two, three. One, two, three. Anchor.
[565.46s -> 577.58s]  Go for it. I'll do the jump. Okay. Um, what, what, what? I don't know. What? Just swing. I can't.
[577.58s -> 583.96s]  Why do my forehead get so much bigger? I don't know. Did we break it that? All right. All right.
[583.96s -> 594.18s]  All right. No, no, no. So now if you swing, you can, oh, there we go. All right. One, two, three.
[594.26s -> 602.15s]  One, two, three. Don't just jump without counting. Well, I'm getting anchored. We don't need the,
[602.15s -> 611.61s]  I got you. Okay. And you can pull me up. Okay. Ready? One, two, three. One, two, three. All right.
[611.61s -> 617.67s]  You just have to be ready to do the jump. I'm not good at this yet. There you go. All right. Stop.
[617.67s -> 621.98s]  No, don't, don't freak out because we have to get through the tutorial. Okay. That's our child.
[621.98s -> 630.71s]  Ready? How do we get up there? I think we have to just jump. Okay. One, two, three. Oh, yeah. All
[630.71s -> 636.66s]  right. We got it. We're getting there. What a challenge you're undertaking. Enjoy the trip.
[638.66s -> 646.79s]  They aren't coming back. I don't, that's ominous. I don't know why. Wait, don't just jump. I know
[646.79s -> 658.36s]  you're like a fast gamer. You like to go really quickly, but we can't do that here. One, two,
[658.36s -> 668.39s]  three. It's funny. All right. One, two, three. One, two, three. All right. That's wait, wait,
[668.39s -> 676.46s]  hold on. We need the momentum and the jump. That's a lot. That's a big gap. There's a countdown
[676.46s -> 688.60s]  button. What is it? I'm going to the options. You are controlling my video game right now. Am I?
[688.60s -> 705.40s]  Yeah. I don't, I don't have. Don't, dude, are you going to go like change my resolution? I got clap.
[705.40s -> 718.46s]  We got clap. We got pull the rope with jump grab. I don't think I can do that by the way. Rock,
[718.46s -> 724.44s]  paper, scissors. Well, this is yours. This is player two. Yeah, but I wait. Now I can do WASD.
[724.44s -> 732.28s]  That's weird because I, because this is weird. This is weird. This is like a hamachi gameplay.
[732.28s -> 739.00s]  Like we're on a land, but not really. Uh, so look at your controls. Grab is control. Grab is E for
[739.00s -> 753.26s]  me. Four is no down. Wait, I think what it's saying now is you this countdown is four, but you wait.
[753.26s -> 763.11s]  All right. Get out of this menu for a second. I WAC does not work. Okay. Hold on. But can I do
[763.11s -> 770.20s]  that though? I cannot do a countdown. If I go, I can't even hit escape, dude. I literally have no
[770.20s -> 778.94s]  control of my own game. You're okay. So this is really weird. Go. Can you go to my setting? Your
[778.94s -> 789.45s]  countdown is num lock four. What the fuck? Okay. So that's hard to do though. How come I can't just
[789.45s -> 796.12s]  have the same controls as you? I don't know. Why can't we just say it out loud? All right. Let's
[796.12s -> 800.89s]  go. Ready? Okay. I think you need to move over. Maybe you want me to anger. No, no, no less
[800.89s -> 810.66s]  because, because if I swing, then I, what I'm saying is when you're that close, I just end up
[810.66s -> 818.22s]  standing. I know. But wait, you all right. You ready? That's not going to help me. Okay. Wait,
[818.22s -> 829.14s]  wait. Let me, let me do the other direction. Let me get that. Okay. Ready? No, no. Are you all right?
[829.14s -> 842.22s]  Oh shit. I killed him. Okay. Can I, can you hit escape for me? Cause I don't know what, how to
[842.22s -> 851.34s]  get to my menu. I now go to your menu. Now go to like controls. Now go to me, like Fred player two
[851.34s -> 867.08s]  select like my tab at the top. I did control, grab objects, save checkpoint, pull rope is shift
[867.08s -> 873.06s]  countdown is four. That's not what it's going to be. Be like, it's the N four is num lock. Yeah.
[873.06s -> 883.99s]  No, no, no, no, no. This is being changed. Uh, this is going to be press game pad. Can it be right
[883.99s -> 896.47s]  control? Wait, there is a gigantic game pad at the top. Oh, thank God. Oh yes. Okay. Left, right,
[896.47s -> 905.19s]  jump anchor. Grab his left trigger, left bumper, pull rope is B. All right, let's go. You can,
[905.19s -> 924.18s]  you can get me out of here now. It didn't, it doesn't, it didn't do anything. Do I have to
[924.18s -> 933.03s]  select it for you? I don't know. Press left on the D pad. It's weirdly enough. I don't have any
[933.03s -> 939.38s]  control of any of this. Now I do. Like I can control this now. So if I go to Fred player two,
[940.02s -> 946.18s]  it says game pad. Yes. Is there like a yes button? Like an accept button? No, I think what chat is
[946.18s -> 952.76s]  an understanding is when I go into the options, it is changing what your options are. Yeah.
[952.76s -> 958.92s]  And we're on the internet. This is okay. I select game pad. I have to connect a controller,
[958.92s -> 962.44s]  but it works for him, but I don't have a controller connected. Okay, but hold on a second.
[962.44s -> 969.30s]  We can't have the same inputs on keyboard. So this is working for me. I'm using my controller
[969.30s -> 978.30s]  right now. So if I hit back, back, back, I have no control anymore and it doesn't work. And now I
[978.30s -> 985.16s]  have no control. I can't do it. I'm just going to use the fucking, wait, nothing works now.
[990.52s -> 999.69s]  Click that. So we had another backup game. No, this is fun. This is really fun. All right. Should
[999.69s -> 1012.39s]  we restart the game? I don't know if that's going to help. All right. Just get us out of this.
[1012.39s -> 1018.47s]  Like this. Can you like jump off or something and pull us down? Exit to main menu. All right. Now,
[1018.47s -> 1022.63s]  wait, can you set up your options before we play? Okay. Set up your options before we do anything.
[1023.56s -> 1031.75s]  I have access. I can use my controller options, controls, game pad. I'm player two.
[1032.55s -> 1041.10s]  This is, it works. It's working right now. This works right now. Okay. Okay. I, I let's just check
[1041.10s -> 1048.79s]  it again. I'm going to put them both on the game pad. No, wait, would that fuck up for you? Okay.
[1048.79s -> 1063.86s]  If I'm Fred, no idea. I mean, it works right now. All right. So invite me. Yeah. My chat's saying
[1063.86s -> 1072.46s]  you can't play on a game pad. You would just have to use different keyboard controls. Okay. Well,
[1072.54s -> 1080.06s]  then we're just going to have to do that. I'm fine with, with the arrow keys. You either both
[1080.06s -> 1084.63s]  have to be keyboard or both game pad. You can't mix it. So do you have a game pad? I don't know
[1084.63s -> 1096.52s]  where it is. Let's just go. We were doing fine. That's bizarre. Okay. Uh, I'm ready for an invite.
[1096.52s -> 1105.99s]  You want an invite? I, I sent it and now I can't. I'm so confused. The whole premise of this game
[1105.99s -> 1125.70s]  is co-op and it doesn't. Okay. You're bread. I'm Fred. Okay. Are we good? Are we? You can move.
[1125.70s -> 1129.86s]  I can move. You know what your grab button is? Cause it looks like grabbing walls is also
[1129.86s -> 1138.41s]  grab this control for me. I believe. Okay. Is that the wall? Maybe not. Is it number,
[1138.41s -> 1144.22s]  the number pad control that's up there? Hold on. Can you go look at my controls?
[1145.59s -> 1158.14s]  Okay. Hold on. Red two. You just do it. It's weird because when I'm looking at Fred two,
[1158.14s -> 1164.14s]  it switches the controls for you. No, that's gotta be left control. I can change it for you.
[1164.14s -> 1173.42s]  I can do it too. Grab object. I want it to be shift, pull rope, right shift. What on earth?
[1173.42s -> 1188.14s]  No, like Z clap two. Um, I'm going to do two here. Three comes up one countdown X interact E. Okay.
[1188.14s -> 1196.81s]  I think that should be fine. I get us out of here. Okay. All right. I can grab. We're good. Okay.
[1196.81s -> 1214.94s]  We're good. We're good. Ready? Yes. Actually very helpful. Three, two, one. You gotta pull with up
[1214.94s -> 1226.41s]  jump. Yeah. There we go. Okay. Wow. Look at that synchronicity. Okay. So you, we can try this again.
[1226.41s -> 1232.14s]  Ready? All right. We're going to slingshot over there to the wall. You might have to grab it.
[1232.14s -> 1245.90s]  I'm going to try to grab. Hey, you ready? I'm going on the next one. Got it up. Jump, jump. Yeah.
[1245.90s -> 1252.02s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we do here. Probably double jump. I think it's showing us arrows up
[1252.02s -> 1261.93s]  there. Why? Oh, I just jumped. There we go. Okay. We just, we just wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1261.93s -> 1281.24s]  What the heck? That was, that baited us. Trying to teach us something. See, you know, I'm just
[1281.24s -> 1294.68s]  going on that. Okay. You ready? I'm ready. Going on the next one. Wow. Can you do anything about this?
[1294.68s -> 1306.89s]  Can you like worms your way up there? You're going to, you're dying. You gotta let go. You gotta let
[1306.89s -> 1326.63s]  go. This is as far as we get, huh? We made it already. Okay. Ready? I'm going on. Wait,
[1326.63s -> 1343.94s]  hold on. I'm going too far. Hey, I'm going on the next one. Up, up. All right. Sorry guys. My bad.
[1349.77s -> 1358.34s]  Okay. So, okay. So what, what's the deal here? You, you, it shows us in the picture. So grab,
[1358.34s -> 1364.92s]  one of us, do you want to grab it or do you want me to do it? Uh, I'm going to grab. No, you,
[1364.92s -> 1369.64s]  why would, I don't know. You freaked me out. You did the one, two, three, go. One, two, three,
[1369.64s -> 1375.48s]  go means we go. I don't think I could jump and reach the wall unless we both jumped up. I don't
[1375.48s -> 1379.96s]  know why you jumped forward. I saw the one, two, three, and I'm like, I have to go. He's doing it.
[1379.96s -> 1388.98s]  I'm going to be very clear. I'm going to be very deliberate. I'm going to give
[1388.98s -> 1401.13s]  hand written instructions. I'm going on this one. You can do it for sure. Just get enough momentum.
[1410.95s -> 1416.90s]  Brother. Oh brother. You can't, you just gotta stand. You gotta stay up there and you keep doing
[1416.90s -> 1421.93s]  your little joke. Pull me up. What do you mean my little joke? We don't even need the timing for
[1421.93s -> 1432.95s]  that one. All right. It's actually kind of hard to do this. You ready? So when you get the momentum,
[1432.95s -> 1441.46s]  you do the jump. You're not getting a lot of it. You jumped at the wrong time. You're not getting
[1441.46s -> 1448.78s]  momentum like I get momentum. You're, you're a dead weight. I had plenty of momentum. You're not,
[1449.34s -> 1455.96s]  you're an anchor. Look at, there's not much more momentum I can give you.
[1456.68s -> 1461.00s]  You weren't doing that before. You see how you can't get up there unless I jump with you.
[1461.00s -> 1482.57s]  So give me a countdown. Let's go. Why are you trying to mess me up? I'm connected to you.
[1482.57s -> 1499.70s]  You're the anchor. Yes. Next one. Nice. Okay. All right. So what I'm saying here is we need
[1499.70s -> 1506.92s]  to both jump straight up at the same time. Then you grab the wall. I, and then we grab the wall.
[1506.92s -> 1520.04s]  Yes. Okay. We're jumping up, not forward. Yes. I know I'm hitting it. We gotta, you gotta,
[1520.20s -> 1535.86s]  you gotta let go. Yeah. You gotta get higher. Okay. Look at us. There we go. Look at that.
[1536.74s -> 1539.62s]  Look at that. All right. Are we going for the right or are we going up here?
[1542.14s -> 1552.52s]  We're going to jump to the right. Got it. Men. Now what? The same thing on this left wall.
[1552.52s -> 1559.70s]  You're going to grab the left wall. Yep. And then I'm going to swing up. You're going to grab it.
[1559.70s -> 1568.50s]  I just, I just pressed the button. It must've been a lag. It's just a bad program.
[1568.58s -> 1576.38s]  Okay. All right. How are you? Are you sweating? I'm, oh, that was fun. What's the next game?
[1578.25s -> 1582.47s]  Oh, you're not pulling out. You're not pulling out right now. You're not pulling out right now.
[1582.47s -> 1596.66s]  You ready? Okay. This is just Jump King with two people. Yeah. I never even played Jump King.
[1596.66s -> 1600.66s]  Don't, you'll, you'll be very upset at yourself for like a week. But we're doing that,
[1600.66s -> 1617.80s]  but worse. Um, we're at forty. Three, two, one. All right. Am I anchoring? Yeah. Okay. I'm going
[1617.80s -> 1626.81s]  to wait a second here because this is important. We make this. Yeah. Just do that. Ready? Got it.
[1626.81s -> 1641.64s]  Great. Achievement up here. Oh, look at that cute little baby. Our baby. Oh, we had together. Oh,
[1646.47s -> 1651.16s]  okay. You see what's going on here. Okay. I do, but I don't. You're grabbing. I need to grab.
[1652.41s -> 1656.01s]  All right. Or do you want me to grab? No, I'll grab. I'll grab. It better not be a lag.
[1656.49s -> 1669.98s]  Can you grab? I'm going to try. Okay. Give me the timer. Okay. Let go. What? Wait,
[1670.78s -> 1675.05s]  that makes logical. That does make logical sense. I think you need to, as you're doing it,
[1675.05s -> 1678.81s]  you need to grab, you need to grab that side. I need to grab on the other side.
[1678.81s -> 1687.30s]  We're not in a bad position. It's just, it's stressful because there's a timer of how long
[1687.30s -> 1698.07s]  you can hold on. Wait a second. This is a different route. Okay. If we mess this up,
[1698.07s -> 1703.27s]  we have to do everything again. I know. And I know you hate this. You hate more than anything,
[1703.27s -> 1709.10s]  like having to do the thing over again, which is why you never play these games up,
[1709.10s -> 1714.90s]  up. You always anchor up. I need to anchor. Otherwise we'll fall. No, you pull up and then
[1714.90s -> 1720.20s]  I pull, I pull up, I pull, you pull up, you're down. That was a weird, you, that was weird.
[1720.20s -> 1727.69s]  What you just did. Hold on. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Now wait a minute. I'm going to grab the
[1727.69s -> 1731.69s]  first one and then you're going to swing up to the wall on the other side and grab it.
[1731.69s -> 1734.65s]  And then you're going to swing and we're going to swing over there. Yes. You got it.
[1747.11s -> 1758.23s]  Oh, I'm good. Ready? A little more, a little more, a little more. More. Okay. Ready? On this one,
[1758.23s -> 1764.09s]  on this one. Oh, we had it. Okay. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it.
[1764.09s -> 1782.25s]  We got it. We got it. We got it. We can do it. What the fuck? I was anchored. You were anchor.
[1782.25s -> 1800.06s]  Okay. I'm going on this one. Okay. All right. Let's go over the plan again. I grabbed the wall
[1800.06s -> 1803.82s]  first. You grabbed and I grabbed and then what happened there though? I feel like we did that
[1803.82s -> 1810.25s]  pretty well. I think you might've just let go at a weird angle and then we didn't, we didn't
[1810.25s -> 1830.25s]  launch up. We kind of launched very true. All right. Why have we got this? I'm going to go
[1830.25s -> 1843.67s]  on this one. I don't know. I don't know. It was too late. I like the first one. I feel like the
[1843.67s -> 1849.16s]  first one was too early. All right. That one must've been too late. Not enough momentum.
[1850.12s -> 1881.83s]  I'm going to go on this one. Good thing I pulled you. All right, buddy. I'm going to go on the next
[1881.83s -> 1889.11s]  one. You're doing it too late. Is it? Really though? I thought that one was pretty good.
[1889.11s -> 1898.07s]  My momentum's going up, not left by the time you let go. I'm so concerned that it's not going to
[1898.07s -> 1910.46s]  be enough. Whatever. I'm going on, not this one. Is it going the wrong way? Okay. Going on this one.
[1911.26s -> 1917.74s]  No, it's hard. It's hard. There we go. Okay. I'm just going to go on whenever I can.
[1917.74s -> 1948.25s]  Is that enough? Okay. Go one. This one. Oh, yes. Oh, oh, just bring yourself up. Nice job.
[1948.25s -> 1953.69s]  High five. High five. High five there. No, don't jump. Don't jump. No, no, no. False, false. Okay.
[1954.33s -> 1962.14s]  I was trying to emote. Just give me the finger. Yeah. Rock, paper, scissors. I don't even know
[1962.14s -> 1967.74s]  what button that is on mine. Okay. We got to jump up and grab this wall. Wait. Okay. You talk about
[1967.74s -> 1975.24s]  the wall, the vertical wall. Yes. Okay. Can we even get it? Yes. Let's do a test to make sure.
[1975.24s -> 1980.34s]  We can do it. All right. Who is grabbing? You or me? Oh, you want to do a test? Yeah, we can
[1980.34s -> 1994.94s]  absolutely do that. I will grab. You are grabbing. Okay. Ready? Yes. Okay. And you just get up here
[1994.94s -> 2005.86s]  or do we need to go from here? I don't know. I think you can get up here. Yeah. Oh. All right.
[2005.86s -> 2016.10s]  Stop swinging. Stop swinging for one second. Let's pull on mine. I don't think you can pull
[2016.10s -> 2030.39s]  me here. I can. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now we're jumping left. Oh, yeah. I didn't think we were
[2030.39s -> 2038.47s]  going to get up this far. What are you doing? We're going to the top. Good luck, guys. You'll
[2038.47s -> 2049.66s]  need it. Is it just going to be a bunch of people that make fun of us? Probably. He said, watch it.
[2049.66s -> 2059.86s]  Hold on. He said, watch out. What does this say? You already have that. Chad is here.
[2060.74s -> 2070.73s]  That's true. All right. Simple. You almost didn't make that. All right. You want me to anchor?
[2071.62s -> 2076.02s]  Yeah, that's big. This is a lot. And we can overshoot this too. So,
[2076.98s -> 2089.43s]  GG. I'm going to go. I'm just going to pick a good time. Got it? Oh, GG. What is this hook?
[2089.43s -> 2096.63s]  I don't know. You want to try and grab it? Jump up and grab it? Yeah.
[2096.63s -> 2110.41s]  It went too far. That's bait. I don't want to get a picture. No one cares.
[2110.41s -> 2116.38s]  Oh, yeah. That was bait. Was it? It was all bait. Everything. The whole thing was bait. What do
[2116.38s -> 2121.80s]  you mean? Everything. I'm bait. You're bait. Oh, boy. We're falling apart. Hold on. You didn't
[2121.80s -> 2140.20s]  anchor. You didn't anchor. You didn't anchor. You didn't anchor. Oh, it's all right. Let's speedrun.
[2140.20s -> 2172.39s]  You can help. Speedrun. Nothing's going to go wrong. I don't. Okay. Just pull me up. We can do
[2172.39s -> 2180.04s]  it. We got baited. It's fine. Just pull me up. Speedrun. We should not even need to communicate
[2180.04s -> 2197.85s]  for these ones. Yeah. We've done them so many times. Can I pull you from here? Fuck. Okay. No
[2197.85s -> 2202.65s]  communication right now. Okay. No communication. Silence. I want silence and I want you to fucking
[2202.65s -> 2207.50s]  go. Ready? Put both your headphones in if they're not in. I know mine weren't. Ready? We're just
[2207.50s -> 2234.25s]  going. Yeah. That's not a jump we can make. Oh, are we still communicating?
[2236.33s -> 2257.91s]  Let go. Let go. Okay. Fingers are sweaty. All right. Let's see. This game is like,
[2257.91s -> 2261.75s]  hey, play this game with your friend and see like try to this patience. And is it your real friend?
[2261.75s -> 2276.01s]  This book is all over me. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no. Let's just do it the right way.
[2276.01s -> 2281.13s]  Okay. Why? What did you just say?
[2283.37s -> 2302.65s]  I can. Yeah, we're good. Now I'm just going to go like this. Let's see who your true friends are.
[2302.65s -> 2311.53s]  We're incapable of jumping unless I do a full 360. I did look at my keyboard. I didn't know
[2311.53s -> 2331.67s]  when fucking Z was. Okay. Ready? I'm grabbing. Yes. I can just pull you up. Oh, buddy boy. Oh,
[2332.63s -> 2339.11s]  buddy boy. You're you're trying to do something. No, no, no, no, no. You just you went at the wrong
[2339.11s -> 2362.46s]  time. Play it back and times minus 10 speed. You're trolling. I'm very concerned about you.
[2362.46s -> 2367.94s]  Don't be. I want to win just as much as you do. Truthfully, I don't want to.
[2369.46s -> 2385.35s]  I suspect that the cost of winning is too high on the next one. Okay. You grab. Then I grab
[2395.78s -> 2422.74s]  going on the next one. That was not fast enough. Jesus Christ. All right. You grab. Nice. Oh,
[2422.74s -> 2433.11s]  I had a leg. All right. We need to take this one slow because this is the hard one. This jump is
[2433.11s -> 2440.86s]  the hard jump. Do we? Okay. Right here. You think right here? Right in the middle or further up?
[2440.86s -> 2447.14s]  You're good. I you need to be going full revolutions like crazy. I'm aware that you
[2447.14s -> 2456.84s]  need a full revolution man. There it is. All right. Okay, we can do this one. Can we look down?
[2456.84s -> 2462.38s]  Like what is going on here? I don't know. Is that that next jump felt impossible? It did.
[2462.38s -> 2470.10s]  Unless we have to swing. We might have to do a big swing jump. Well, let's just get on with this
[2470.10s -> 2480.22s]  hook. What is with the hook? There's there's I don't think we can get it though. Okay. Okay.
[2480.86s -> 2489.64s]  What do we do? There's no way. Is there no way? But it has to be that's pointing. It's playing
[2489.64s -> 2495.62s]  there. Wait, we can save the game. How? I don't know. It's a save states. Some people are saying
[2495.62s -> 2500.68s]  save, save, save states, save states. What are you doing? If you get the item, it will give you
[2500.68s -> 2509.19s]  save states. You want to just use one here? We already have one. Well, I don't know. I don't
[2509.19s -> 2513.67s]  know what they're talking about. How do we use it? I think it was like one of the F keys. Maybe.
[2513.67s -> 2528.79s]  Was it a lie? Save checkpoint. Yeah. We use it. I can't do it. So I guess maybe we do have to get
[2528.79s -> 2536.04s]  this. All right. What if we just drop down? We're getting one guide over. It's assist options. It's
[2536.04s -> 2544.95s]  under assist options. Oh, so it's if you're bad. But I know this is your least favorite game in
[2544.95s -> 2551.80s]  the world. You don't like to have to start completely over at zero and do it all over again.
[2551.80s -> 2561.56s]  You hate that, don't you? I do. You do? Well, it depends. Look, we're just going to do it right.
[2561.56s -> 2566.49s]  Okay. You ready? I'm just going to do it right. Why did you do that? Why would you do that?
[2568.87s -> 2582.39s]  You ready? Okay. Yes. All the way. You're gonna have to pull me up. Why don't we do a running
[2582.39s -> 2590.06s]  jump on this one? Like run at the same time? Oh, his brain is exploding. Okay. The go,
[2590.06s -> 2594.06s]  the three, two, one, go is going to be to start running. And then once you hit the end, just jump.
[2594.06s -> 2603.51s]  Okay. All right. Yeah, I get it. I get it. I get it. Okay. Oh, we actually did it. Damn,
[2603.51s -> 2608.23s]  that was a good call. You could just let me hang because we got it. We got to do another jump here.
[2608.23s -> 2611.99s]  Right. But this is going to be horrible. Or we're all the way back at the beginning.
[2611.99s -> 2616.28s]  And notice this is, okay, we're just going to do the full rotation. This is a big jump. Full
[2616.28s -> 2629.70s]  rotation. Trying to get it. I'm trying to get it in the right direction. Okay. You got it. You got
[2629.70s -> 2635.30s]  it. Nice. Okay, we're good. So now we're at, okay, don't let's not freak out. Get hands off the
[2635.30s -> 2640.58s]  keyboard for a second. Wipe your hands. Hands are getting sweaty. Yep. Okay. So I think we have to
[2640.58s -> 2649.82s]  go either up or down. I don't know which one is the right one. Oh, it's pointing up. I don't know
[2649.82s -> 2657.29s]  what that basket is. Maybe there is like an NPC or something down here. It dangle me. I can't see.
[2657.29s -> 2663.42s]  I'm blind. You can't see anything. There's a hoop down there, right? It's like a net. Yeah,
[2663.42s -> 2668.31s]  let's go down there. Should we? I feel like this is scary. It'll be easy to get back up. Oh,
[2668.31s -> 2677.69s]  it's just a hoop. Okay. What if I throw you in that? Can we like do that? I mean, we could
[2677.69s -> 2682.33s]  swing off the top if we want it to put someone in the hoop. But why? I feel like it's the game
[2682.33s -> 2695.53s]  is saying, hey, there's a hoop here. You should get dunked in the hoop. Do you want to get dunked
[2695.53s -> 2700.09s]  in the hoop? I mean, we could try it. You want to just dangle and I'll let go. Let's jump across
[2700.09s -> 2712.58s]  and I'll grab that wall and dangle you into it. Okay. So you're going to have to let go.
[2712.58s -> 2718.58s]  That was fun. That was great. Hey, we did it. That's fantastic. Wait, maybe I have to grab it.
[2718.58s -> 2724.39s]  How do you do the pull up? For me, it was Z. It's a very specific key you have to have it be.
[2724.39s -> 2747.40s]  What is the key for you? Q. All right, let's just go up. It's like that is a signal. Hey,
[2747.40s -> 2751.69s]  I'm not going to make the mistake because I know that you'll be like, look at what you did. And
[2751.69s -> 2759.38s]  you're so bad at games. Oh, look at you. Now what? We got to slingshot someone at that wall.
[2759.86s -> 2775.10s]  I'll grab it. Okay. I'm going to throw you at it. I think we need a full revolution. I got it.
[2775.10s -> 2781.00s]  Good. Now you grab that one. We got it. We got to grab the other side. Yep. I need a little bit
[2781.00s -> 2787.50s]  slack. Okay. And you're going to have to let go when I'm in the right spot. Nice job. And that's
[2787.50s -> 2798.02s]  how we get up here. That's how we get up to 70 fucking two. Don't blow it here. All right.
[2798.02s -> 2822.26s]  Ready? You need more room? Okay. Hold on. Swing. For what? I'm telling you. Swing. Swing.
[2822.34s -> 2828.70s]  Oh, so a full swing. I can't full swing because there's a wall. We're good. So we didn't drop all
[2828.70s -> 2844.76s]  the way down. This is the one we have to run at, right? Yep. You know what? Are you confident in
[2844.76s -> 2851.30s]  this? Do you want me to do it? We're going to maintain our roles. We're not. We're not goofing
[2851.30s -> 2877.18s]  around. Okay. Good. Roles maintained. Stare. No goofing. Stare. No goofing. Was that a goof?
[2877.18s -> 2880.46s]  You goofing right now? Are you seriously goofing when we're about to do the big jumps?
[2880.46s -> 2887.61s]  No. Or the big boys? All right. Same deal. I might actually have to grab this though.
[2887.61s -> 2907.77s]  I mean, whoever can grab it, grab it. Yeah. You have your mouse on your screen apparently.
[2907.77s -> 2921.56s]  Somebody came into my chat to tell me that. Oh no. Is he okay? I need to do CPR. Oh,
[2921.56s -> 2939.90s]  twerk it. Twerk it. All right. You want to climb the mountain again? Kind of. Shit. No,
[2939.90s -> 2964.09s]  we got to go back. Sorry. I feel like this three, two, one go, finding out that there's a pleasant
[2964.09s -> 2969.59s]  beep, beep, beep, beep. It's just like activating, like neurons are firing in your brain,
[2969.59s -> 2976.01s]  like unparalleled. So we have to keep going. When you hear the boom, you're like you're just
[2976.01s -> 2979.45s]  out ready. I gotta jump. I gotta jump. I gotta jump. It's like the Mario Kart thing. It's like
[2985.30s -> 2993.21s]  then you've like fucking eyes, your pupils just go fucking wide. What is it? Like a rat in a
[2993.21s -> 3005.35s]  Skinner box? You've been conditioned. I'm grabbing it. Okay. Wait, no, no, no. You can't, on go,
[3005.35s -> 3010.71s]  you can't say no way. I know, but I was confident that I could grab you if you jumped. If we
[3010.71s -> 3037.24s]  failed and you didn't seem ready. What the fuck? I thought that was good. I'm dragging your ass
[3037.24s -> 3058.57s]  up the mountain. I don't even care. Oh, geez. One last real try and then we'll play the other one.
[3058.57s -> 3066.22s]  Is this really going to be a three game night? I don't know. Are you down after this? I don't
[3066.22s -> 3083.54s]  know. I'm just surprised that. Okay, I'm grabbing. Hey, just in case you didn't know, I'm grabbing.
[3083.54s -> 3098.98s]  I have an itchy head. Don't wait. Don't wait. Okay. You're grabbing first, right? I'm grabbing.
[3098.98s -> 3117.58s]  That's pressing shift. Sorry. Anytime I play a game like this, do you get like this too?
[3117.58s -> 3122.47s]  Where like I'm, I said at this desk, I've probably sat here for hundreds and hundreds,
[3122.47s -> 3127.46s]  if not maybe thousands of hours. I right now, I'm so uncomfortable. It's just like,
[3127.46s -> 3131.86s]  oh no, everything's wrong. Like where I am seated, how high I am in the chair,
[3131.86s -> 3138.76s]  where my fingers are, everything just feels incorrect. I get that in other games.
[3138.76s -> 3184.97s]  No. Okay. Okay. That one is actually really hard. What a deluge. What are you doing?
[3187.96s -> 3191.64s]  You did the Mario thing where you jump after, jump after landing perfectly. Well,
[3191.64s -> 3194.76s]  I pressed up to try and pull you up because that's what I thought it was before.
[3194.76s -> 3211.50s]  Okay. We, we botched this twice in a row. What's the problem? You botched this because
[3211.50s -> 3217.78s]  you're the one letting go. Yeah. But it's, I feel like it's, this is very precise, very difficult.
[3217.78s -> 3222.34s]  I think you really, you really got a running jumpy. I don't know. You just got to do it.
[3222.34s -> 3229.96s]  You just got to be good. I'm going to go for it. I'm doing a perfect circle. That was, I mean,
[3229.96s -> 3235.29s]  that was good. That was like, I don't know if I could do better than that. I don't know if I
[3235.29s -> 3240.71s]  could have done better than that. That was like right there. What the hell? You've done better
[3240.71s -> 3256.98s]  than that. No, I didn't. I damn it. What are we doing? What am I doing wrong there? Are you
[3256.98s -> 3264.39s]  jumping or are you not? All right. Do you want, do you want to move on to the cat horror game or what?
[3266.66s -> 3272.95s]  I will continue to play as you want to play. Let's get up there one more time. And then
[3272.95s -> 3288.74s]  do you want to try that? Do you want to try that? It's tricky. This game is addicting though.
[3288.74s -> 3295.35s]  Really fun concept. I love the concept. Apparently you can play it in single player and you get like
[3295.35s -> 3305.77s]  a rock. That's weird. I'm not exactly sure how that works. Do you want to try these or do you
[3305.77s -> 3313.16s]  want me to just keep going for it? Stay in your lane. Yeah, but me staying in my lane didn't work
[3313.16s -> 3321.78s]  out the last time. I, you have more experience under your belt. That's true. I don't want to
[3321.78s -> 3345.42s]  throw that experience away, but like also you're really kind of trash. No, it's hard. You do it.
[3345.98s -> 3362.82s]  And you'll see it's hard. It's, it's like the moment. I'm doing it. You're trash. You're trash.
[3362.82s -> 3375.94s]  You are trash. You trash can garbage can. No, get back. You get back in there and you,
[3375.94s -> 3386.09s]  we're doing it. You closed it. Okay. We could, we could do it right.
[3388.65s -> 3392.09s]  I, it wouldn't be funny if you were, if you just weren't even close.
[3393.77s -> 3398.71s]  That's funny. How you doing? Are you, are you, are you good? You still, you still here? No,
[3398.71s -> 3404.46s]  sure. We, we can, I'll invite you again. Cool. All right, let's go. What do you like,
[3404.46s -> 3411.58s]  what do you like about these kinds of torture CBT games? Cause it, it shows the, it shows your
[3411.58s -> 3418.01s]  character. It shows if you're really able to persevere through something very, very difficult.
[3418.57s -> 3427.46s]  It takes a lot of patience, which I don't have any of, which is, it's a great challenge for me
[3427.46s -> 3438.36s]  because I have zero patience. What? I have zero patience. So it's a good challenge to sit down
[3438.36s -> 3444.90s]  and be like, just do it. Okay. You, I want you to do these because you need to get some experience.
[3444.90s -> 3452.01s]  I don't want to do it. I want to stay in our lane. Okay. We're going to stay in our lanes.
[3452.01s -> 3458.57s]  Okay. Why did we just do that? We could have just jumped normally.
[3458.57s -> 3472.63s]  Well, you were getting practice. Oh, I see. I do want you to be a little bit more confident in
[3472.63s -> 3504.92s]  these though. I don't need to do a full 360 for these tiny ones. You're right. No fucking,
[3504.92s -> 3515.94s]  I don't have patience. I do gardening and clay sculptures. Do you have any plants? No. Why not?
[3515.94s -> 3525.80s]  Why do I need plants? That's fun. Wrong way. What happens if now's not a good time to test?
[3528.17s -> 3550.18s]  Now's not a good time to test. I don't think it is. Remember this part. Well, that was weird.
[3550.18s -> 3563.83s]  I held it. I'm dying. I'm actually going to die. Stop. You're freaking me out. That one's actually
[3563.83s -> 3591.43s]  really, really hard. It is. Stop fucking around. Thanks. All right. We're back. Not yet. We're not
[3591.43s -> 3603.99s]  back yet. We're almost back. You fucker. You, you got in my head. You were like, you need to go faster
[3603.99s -> 3629.18s]  with these ones. Not this one. This one's tough. We're not, it's fine. We're right here. You're
[3629.18s -> 3634.94s]  doing those way too late. I know, but it's just, it's a little, just go. I'll get it again. I'll get
[3634.94s -> 3665.16s]  it. Okay. It's hard. I promise. It's tricky. Hey, you got the easy job. You just have to dangle.
[3665.16s -> 3686.95s]  There you go. There's no encouragement. Do not encourage. Don't encourage me. Okay. Which do you
[3686.95s -> 3704.55s]  like more, the game or me suffering? Oh, I need a full revolution for these. You got it. You got it.
[3704.55s -> 3732.20s]  We got it. That was a, that's tough one. Oh, wait, hold on. It's sweaty. Oh yeah. My game lagged. It
[3732.20s -> 3738.70s]  actually did. I swear to God people saw it. It was like, it actually happened. I swear to God,
[3738.70s -> 3745.22s]  it actually happened. It really happened. It's unfortunate. It really did. I wish I was making
[3745.22s -> 3764.76s]  it up. I'm not about those checkpoints. Stop and do it. All right. You, you claim to want to try
[3764.76s -> 3769.00s]  and then like, you get us in, we get out of a rhythm and then you like anchor yourself on the ground.
[3770.55s -> 3776.49s]  I'm, I'm coping. All right. This is the last one we're going to do. And then you want to play the
[3776.49s -> 3784.95s]  other game or you take it off. I keep hearing, this is the last one, but I feel like you really
[3784.95s -> 3789.88s]  deeply want this. I don't think we're going to beat it. I just want to get up to a hundred.
[3789.88s -> 3837.69s]  We're at like 75, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. All right. Don't do that. Ding, ding,
[3837.69s -> 3841.45s]  actually stop doing that. Cause you're like a, you're like 30 milliseconds, like later,
[3841.45s -> 3875.42s]  I don't I don't like that. Finally, we can agree you're gonna fucking kill us keeping you on your toes. Uh-huh. You got it
[3888.18s -> 3889.94s]  Come on
[3889.94s -> 3904.72s]  There it is. All right, we're back. Oh, wow. We're back
[3905.46s -> 3910.74s]  Really back. This is this is the wall right here. It's been the wall the whole time
[3911.14s -> 3914.78s]  All right, let me let me get ready. So I'm doing it too late or too early
[3914.90s -> 3920.98s]  I don't know. I don't know what you're doing. This is to get a failure. Okay. All right. All right
[3921.66s -> 3929.96s]  You're not gonna make it. I'm doing it too late too late too late. I'm not gonna make it if you're going the wrong way
[3930.66s -> 3937.50s]  And there it is and there oh
[3937.82s -> 3953.76s]  We're back 72. This is where we lost last time. This is the one right here. We're gonna get up to a hundred
[3953.88s -> 3964.93s]  Stop looking around. I know you mess around. This one's fucked up. It is I need you on your a game
[3964.93s -> 3965.45s]  All right
[3965.45s -> 3970.29s]  I have to do this one a little later as we get some air because it's higher than us. All right
[3970.29s -> 3986.86s]  Here we go. I'm going for it. I need a full revolution bingo. All right, 75. Let's go. Oh
[3991.02s -> 3997.03s]  This one might be hard because is it is it a jump from here? No, it's not this is a game ender
[3997.11s -> 4001.85s]  This is if we slide down we got to climb all the way back up here again. All right, we're not gonna
[4001.85s -> 4003.85s]  That's that's not have the end
[4004.21s -> 4013.04s]  People saying save it right now. What button is saved? I gotta go into like cheater mode because it's options
[4013.68s -> 4023.24s]  Options has um, it's check do checkpoint checkpoint checkpoint. We bought we got a card didn't we so F is not let me try it
[4023.56s -> 4027.96s]  What is it on mine? What's on my friend and
[4028.36s -> 4036.54s]  Okay, let's try it ready. Yeah, I don't think it doesn't do anything doesn't do anything either. We talked to the guy
[4036.54s -> 4042.35s]  Let's might as well talk. I don't know
[4044.55s -> 4049.03s]  Assist mode needs to be turned on. Yes, just mode checkpoints. Ah
[4050.03s -> 4052.79s]  And then there's pole rope which was on by default
[4053.80s -> 4066.73s]  Infinite jumps who cares anymore? We don't need any of them. That's when I get to a hundred. Okay, so if we go oh, oh
[4068.95s -> 4077.67s]  Look at that. Okay, cool. So the plan is we know the plan. I grabbed first. Yes
[4089.65s -> 4111.27s]  Okay, and then I'm gonna let you go. You're gonna grab that wall. You gotta let go. You ready? Yes. Yes
[4113.82s -> 4125.42s]  All right, here we are we didn't even need the checkpoint look at this 85 we're good
[4129.40s -> 4140.42s]  This might be a run-and-jumper. Okay, let's do run. Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. What?
[4144.43s -> 4153.44s]  All right, are you dumping your pants right now or are we playing you know, why we're gamer diapers, I'm just going for it
[4161.34s -> 4163.90s]  Fuck yeah, we got the clock. Let's go
[4163.90s -> 4171.19s]  Oh
[4171.23s -> 4172.51s]  Okay
[4172.51s -> 4187.36s]  Now, how do we get back to the checkpoint? I don't know. How do we get to the checkpoint? See em. Oh, I like this game
[4187.36s -> 4231.02s]  No, ready now. Let go. Thank you. We're fine. You look so defeated me your character. Oh
[4232.18s -> 4254.00s]  All right, let's go same deal. This is a run-and-jumper good idea. What are you doing?
[4254.00s -> 4258.64s]  Don't you criticize me when you don't know how hard it is. You gave it one attempt and you were like, yeah
[4258.84s -> 4263.52s]  You're not even waiting for the food. All right, you gave this one attempt an alt F forward the game
[4268.94s -> 4296.40s]  Fucking weird you didn't even grab anything you didn't either true. It's the quiet moments in life. I agree
[4296.94s -> 4314.01s]  You really take in the the snowflakes the beautiful horizon to its wonderful looking. Don't worry. I grabbed it. What's the plan here?
[4317.06s -> 4318.06s]  Oh
[4318.06s -> 4319.98s]  Perfect timing
[4319.98s -> 4338.73s]  This is a jump. This is a jump. This is a jump. Mm-hmm. This is a jump waiting for the countdown
[4338.73s -> 4356.42s]  I haven't seen it. This is a jump. Mm-hmm. You grab in a run start. I'll grab a call
[4356.54s -> 4370.14s]  This is a jump. Yes, it is run start. No, that's gonna fuck us up. It actually mmm
[4370.18s -> 4375.86s]  This might be a swing throw checkpoint. It might be let's just cheat
[4375.86s -> 4379.79s]  Let's jump at it and try and grab it if you miss. All right, what do you want?
[4379.83s -> 4384.18s]  I don't I mean if we're gonna cheat might as well cheat
[4385.92s -> 4388.83s]  Somebody's cheating. Are you ready? I
[4392.51s -> 4395.72s]  Got you. I think this is a regular jump to
[4397.94s -> 4407.58s]  There we are. Look at that get it out of your system cuz we're about to it's about to get hard
[4407.74s -> 4419.82s]  We made it we made it past the first area. We did it or not at a hundred yet. No, we're not
[4419.82s -> 4433.62s]  I mean that good call I guess now what oh, we're just like, yeah
[4433.90s -> 4446.98s]  Alright, I was about to do it too. No, you weren't cat horror game now
[4447.14s -> 4460.48s]  No, I'm going for it. I'm going for it, right? No, I can't start the swinging down here
[4460.48s -> 4472.74s]  It kills the momentum and if you drop I can see there's like shit down there. We don't got to do. Okay
[4474.55s -> 4485.37s]  All right, that's bad. No, they come back. Okay, let's walk over. I guess I just drop you down there
[4485.37s -> 4489.19s]  Oh, wait, we angle you down. Wait, wait, wait
[4489.47s -> 4496.29s]  That's a jump up here jump up to the wall. This might need a running start here. Let's go to the other side
[4496.37s -> 4501.81s]  We're gonna run across and do a jump up. Oh, yeah, just in case we're gonna be careful. I feel you
[4501.81s -> 4511.34s]  Oh, this is gonna be hard. Do you want me to grab?
[4512.14s -> 4516.02s]  Yeah, I want you to fucking grab it. Well, I have you played this before
[4516.22s -> 4521.02s]  Yeah, I you know, I didn't you did even if I was gonna grab you didn't give me enough time to swing over and grab
[4521.02s -> 4526.62s]  I didn't even give me enough to let go. I love it. You flip. I love it
[4526.62s -> 4530.18s]  You flipped it on me. You flipped it on me, but you just went for it. You flipped it on me, too
[4530.18s -> 4532.38s]  That was uncalled for you could have grabbed
[4533.34s -> 4536.66s]  Okay, everything's fine just relax
[4537.34s -> 4563.62s]  Wait for wait for me to grab it. You gotta go. Yep on me up or do you you're gonna pull me up?
[4563.62s -> 4572.55s]  Are we what's happening here? I'm enjoying this. I really need like rest, you know, I
[4574.46s -> 4576.46s]  Did it myself don't worry
[4577.10s -> 4586.08s]  Three one, two, three go. I don't do that. I had to
[4586.84s -> 4588.84s]  Don't do that
[4591.32s -> 4596.24s]  You have to it that's it bill it's built-in timing. All right. All right. All right. All right. We're good
[4596.56s -> 4615.57s]  You just gotta go for it. All right built-in timing. We're just doing the built-in timing. It's built in just do a plot
[4615.57s -> 4617.57s]  It's a normal platformer right now. Oh, yeah
[4617.97s -> 4622.74s]  Okay now wait patience figure out where we're going
[4623.38s -> 4629.06s]  This is tricky cuz we have to jump together to that top left. You'll grab it and then we'll swing. No, no, no
[4629.06s -> 4634.64s]  No, wait, wait, you don't think so. Yes, you're right. I'm gonna I'm gonna jump in I'm gonna grab it
[4635.14s -> 4637.56s]  built-in timing
[4637.56s -> 4655.25s]  Good. Okay, that's gonna fall. So built-in timing. Okay. Okay. Good. Oh
[4656.84s -> 4661.20s]  Wait, hold on. We don't have to there's no built-in timing right now. There is it's a platform
[4661.20s -> 4665.08s]  We need to see what's going on here. We get his go. Just jump up to it. Oh, wait, wait
[4665.08s -> 4670.64s]  All right, you're any fucking bill in timing and you didn't even do it, right, sir
[4673.01s -> 4675.01s]  I'm gonna enjoy this
[4675.01s -> 4678.45s]  Thank you. Thank you for like for taking a second here because I can fucking use it
[4678.97s -> 4682.39s]  Built-in timing top left. Wait, wait, wait
[4683.95s -> 4687.43s]  Okay, you can't just do that. What are you talking about?
[4694.11s -> 4711.46s]  We got a swing and then you we need to run yes built-in timing after you land good good idea
[4714.50s -> 4717.18s]  This might be built-in timing built-in timing. I'm not sure
[4717.18s -> 4719.18s]  Oh
[4719.62s -> 4723.06s]  Get up here get up here get up here get up here we've ducked no, I don't know what to do
[4723.58s -> 4727.50s]  Right. I do rap feels the timing build the timing this way. All right, we're fine
[4727.94s -> 4739.25s]  We've got it. All right, you grab you always grab first
[4743.74s -> 4747.60s]  It didn't grab cuz I was on the ground I expected it to grab
[4751.12s -> 4756.80s]  What what kind of fucked up Mario game have you been playing with the built-in timing is that early?
[4761.30s -> 4763.30s]  We need to wait for this I think
[4764.02s -> 4768.84s]  Oh, I think I I think I think I know what to do. Oh my god
[4769.50s -> 4773.59s]  Okay, we I don't know. I don't get it. We need to look at it for a second
[4773.59s -> 4784.33s]  I'm kind of wondering if you can grab the side of it. What about just jump and left left. I duck
[4788.33s -> 4794.78s]  Okay, we got it like either swing to that platform. I think I think we go left from the middle here built-in timing
[4795.24s -> 4801.06s]  Wait, what? What have you done? No
[4801.82s -> 4807.18s]  No, I thought we built in time. I thought we built in tits. All right built into what you said
[4807.18s -> 4812.26s]  I think we need left. I didn't know what left you meant. Sorry lucky to just pick this up. We're fine
[4812.66s -> 4824.23s]  Okay, so we're gonna drop and then go left drop left built in timing pull me up
[4824.75s -> 4834.40s]  You grab then we'll swing that was fucked up and you know, it that was weird on you. You did great
[4834.96s -> 4838.60s]  What are you? What are you doing? What's happening to you?
[4839.32s -> 4843.80s]  What's happening to you? You didn't anchor when I we why did you not anchor?
[4845.55s -> 4847.55s]  This is so
[4850.50s -> 4854.59s]  How come you jumped weird you're weird
[4858.97s -> 4862.17s]  It's all right, it's all right for some stupid reason I thought this is gonna drop to we're fine
[4862.73s -> 4873.61s]  See you need to anchor who?
[4874.25s -> 4880.44s]  How are we doing this? I don't know we just talk about it. Can we just talk through this? Let's talk
[4883.86s -> 4888.36s]  I think we can make the jump from here to there if we do it
[4888.60s -> 4892.25s]  And then we built in timing
[4892.29s -> 4895.60s]  To the top right. Okay, maybe
[4896.16s -> 4905.13s]  Yep. Okay, we're good now stop and let's look at this one, too
[4905.33s -> 4912.76s]  We're gonna gotta as the things coming down. We're gonna need to built in timing built in timing building timing. Hold on
[4913.56s -> 4920.02s]  That's fucked up. Isn't it? Okay. Okay next one
[4920.02s -> 4923.38s]  We're doing next one as soon as we see the next one coming down. We're gonna jump across
[4923.38s -> 4926.32s]  All right, but what how far down is it back midway?
[4926.98s -> 4931.24s]  What do you want to go midway? Do you want to wait till it's kind of at the bottom?
[4931.32s -> 4935.25s]  What do you think I think we have to wait till it's past the bottom?
[4935.85s -> 4957.12s]  Because otherwise we'll hit our heads. I'm gonna count it down. All right almost do you get infinite checkpoints?
[4957.72s -> 4960.48s]  Stirb wanted to cheat and I was okay
[4960.48s -> 4961.90s]  I kept saying man
[4961.90s -> 4965.16s]  We should really try to do it like on our own and try to really get the achievement of doing it
[4965.16s -> 4967.44s]  But he was like he DM me a few times over here. Just like dude
[4967.44s -> 4973.68s]  I'm fucking leaving if you don't let me do this. He's like, I'm gonna make up a story how I have to go
[4973.82s -> 4975.82s]  Then I'm just like
[4975.98s -> 4982.72s]  Right annoying good job
[4988.26s -> 4994.08s]  Man we're on our toes. Okay, this is double coming by
[4999.50s -> 5004.22s]  Hold me up to the right
[5004.62s -> 5011.88s]  Pull me up. Pull me up. Pull me up. We need to not good timings
[5011.88s -> 5017.04s]  These are not we need it cuz automatic timings cuz I your timing on where you would do that jump is different than mine
[5017.24s -> 5020.08s]  Yeah commander. Give me the give me the little bit
[5020.64s -> 5024.44s]  I don't even know what button that is on mine. I have a different controls. No. No, you don't need to do that
[5024.44s -> 5029.70s]  Just like vocally. Okay, I'm gonna go tell me about it. All right ready three two one go
[5030.14s -> 5033.02s]  There we are again again again
[5033.28s -> 5036.44s]  If we have to go like you stopped, I know but I I was
[5037.16s -> 5038.08s]  distracted
[5038.08s -> 5040.08s]  Can you get on that?
[5040.12s -> 5044.54s]  Let go. Oh nice job. All right, pull me up
[5045.22s -> 5056.84s]  Three two one. All right, we gotta go boom. Boom. You ready? One, two, three go
[5057.34s -> 5058.34s]  Nope
[5058.34s -> 5066.56s]  There we are. Boom. Boom. Then this is another good. This is ready one two go. I wasn't ready
[5066.56s -> 5071.46s]  I but I wasn't ready. It's all right. I but that wasn't you got to take quarterback then
[5071.74s -> 5093.77s]  You got to be quarterback. Look at these fucking timings. Very good. That's not correct. That was does not it's not correct
[5094.29s -> 5106.93s]  Okay, three two one go. Okay. Okay. I understand. I did not understand what you're talking about. So I'm ready to go
[5107.49s -> 5110.53s]  All right, just just jump off off here. Okay, we're gonna
[5111.13s -> 5121.14s]  Very good. Very good. I think I'm lost
[5121.70s -> 5137.76s]  There look at that. Oh my fingers cramping up. Okay. Here's what's gonna happen
[5138.28s -> 5150.46s]  Three two one go we jump on those. Okay, and they're gonna fall and then grab you're gonna grab nice
[5150.78s -> 5160.13s]  This one looks like it's a jump grab and then I grab wall and then I okay. Hold on
[5160.13s -> 5164.53s]  We gotta get this planned out. This is a we jump you grab the left side of wall
[5164.65s -> 5171.93s]  I swing around I grab right side of wall you go. I let go we land on built-in timing
[5172.33s -> 5176.11s]  We have to built-in timing jump to that right wall and I don't know what the hell's over there
[5176.23s -> 5183.82s]  Yep, so you're gonna grab that right most wall. Yep. Okay, right. Let's all the way to the left running start
[5183.82s -> 5201.25s]  Yep for this one. Okay. Here we go. Okay good. I'm gonna grab the other side of the wall. Mm-hmm
[5201.77s -> 5206.69s]  Okay, here we go
[5206.69s -> 5215.09s]  Beautiful. All right. This is where it gets kind of weird. Are we checkpoint Andes?
[5215.53s -> 5217.53s]  Yeah, we're look we've already done
[5218.21s -> 5227.26s]  Six of them so far all of the tension is gone. Hey, it's we're having fun though
[5229.52s -> 5239.91s]  Well, I thought I think we just jump when it's hitting the bottom or no when it's hitting the top maybe yeah
[5240.51s -> 5244.15s]  Hey ready, I'm gonna count three tops and then we're gonna jump
[5244.15s -> 5250.63s]  Okay, we jump on the fourth top so like one two jump on the third one or jump on the like technically the fourth one
[5252.17s -> 5254.17s]  like top top
[5254.41s -> 5260.89s]  Top Joe. Okay. Okay. Okay one two three
[5263.92s -> 5265.92s]  We're okay
[5274.72s -> 5277.52s]  I think it's gonna work. I think I think it's gonna work. Okay
[5278.24s -> 5279.40s]  top
[5279.40s -> 5281.40s]  top top
[5281.40s -> 5283.57s]  Bottom. Yeah, see
[5283.69s -> 5290.67s]  This is a built-in timing this is we jump right when we hit the top and then built-in timing to the right, okay
[5291.63s -> 5293.04s]  All right
[5293.04s -> 5294.36s]  Same deal
[5294.36s -> 5298.36s]  We're your top top go. No, keep it the same top top top go
[5298.80s -> 5303.93s]  There's no need for three top top top. There is keep it consider. You told me to stay consistent with our roles
[5304.13s -> 5306.13s]  Consistency there's an update. There was a patch
[5306.77s -> 5311.85s]  Top top go top top go. Okay, you do the count top
[5312.37s -> 5314.37s]  Top go
[5314.65s -> 5323.77s]  I went look at us
[5323.77s -> 5327.07s]  We don't even got a fucking talk about it people that people that come to the stream
[5327.45s -> 5331.71s]  Are they don't tell them we're using checkpoints until they have to find out cuz they'll think we're good at the end
[5332.03s -> 5338.82s]  So I gotta like I gotta like hold on. Yeah, what's yeah, what's the deal here? We got we gotta hide it. Oh
[5340.34s -> 5343.98s]  Hide it. I see what what is that? It's part of the environment. It's a piece of wood
[5344.50s -> 5346.16s]  Okay, okay
[5346.16s -> 5354.13s]  So I'm gonna jump and grab and then I don't know you jump and grab and then you have to let go when I get
[5354.13s -> 5362.50s]  To the point where I can yeah, that's the hold on. Oh, it doesn't break. Oh, okay
[5366.60s -> 5378.82s]  Alright don't jump and grab. Okay, this doesn't make sense
[5380.54s -> 5384.98s]  You yeah, you need to land what let's grab the I think we could do grab the other side
[5384.98s -> 5390.08s]  What we get one of us can get up and land on top. So like yeah
[5390.26s -> 5397.36s]  No, I don't think that's a strat just hit a swing around and land on top of this just land on it
[5397.36s -> 5401.45s]  But it's gonna break and then you're gonna be dangling below me
[5402.21s -> 5415.67s]  All right, what do you want to do? There's a hole the whole area to the right is extra. Um, I think that's actually what we have to do
[5416.11s -> 5426.03s]  Or maybe go up. No, maybe go from the top. If can we like throw ourselves up? All right, just give me some I
[5435.85s -> 5439.13s]  I don't know how the grab is allowed to work here. Hold on. I don't know
[5440.53s -> 5456.68s]  You're driving. Oh, I thought you want to try something. So what what's your plan? I want to try and not fall on it
[5458.04s -> 5458.96s]  Oh
[5458.96s -> 5468.71s]  Try to grab the other side. That's what I'm saying, but it doesn't let me like swing inward. Mm-hmm. I have an idea
[5469.69s -> 5475.31s]  Let me throw you
[5475.51s -> 5487.33s]  It might
[5487.33s -> 5489.33s]  Everybody we're gonna do our
[5489.41s -> 5492.97s]  20 minute everybody closes their eyes and relaxes. Okay, close your eyes
[5493.49s -> 5505.78s]  What are you doing? We didn't do check one. All right, whatever. Well, we got it. Okay. I tried to grab it
[5508.81s -> 5512.22s]  It's dead it's it has to be you grab the other side
[5518.43s -> 5520.43s]  No, no
[5520.55s -> 5531.56s]  Pull me up you swing you do this swing. So I'm gonna grab it. Okay, you do a full rotation
[5539.24s -> 5546.16s]  That's why we stick to our roles, huh? Oh, it's not as easy as it looks. Oh you tried it one time. I
[5546.92s -> 5548.69s]  Didn't I know?
[5548.69s -> 5561.96s]  Shut up and get off here. Do you hold left or do you have to go like one do I got it?
[5562.16s -> 5565.68s]  Then you hold there then once you've spun around you hold the direction
[5565.96s -> 5572.21s]  Okay, I get it. I thought you had I thought I still had to change momentum from different sides
[5572.21s -> 5576.26s]  I didn't know you could hold it. Thanks for telling me the controls by the way
[5576.26s -> 5583.92s]  Oh, wow, when you're only going one direction, you only hold one direction. We open our eyes. Not yet. It's still relaxing time
[5584.24s -> 5604.74s]  Are you ready? Oh my god. Oh, I was thinking okay. Okay
[5605.20s -> 5608.48s]  We've just been learning we've been learning the rules of the world. Yes, we have
[5609.00s -> 5619.44s]  Okay, you can open your eyes now. Chill. I don't know. I don't know we're good
[5619.56s -> 5625.93s]  I think we just have to just whip our just throw ourselves to the left kind of here you hold
[5625.93s -> 5634.48s]  We assume our roles we're going for you got it. That was weird. It was weird. I
[5644.84s -> 5648.32s]  Think yeah, yeah, it doesn't really give any momentum
[5648.32s -> 5656.24s]  I think you have to grab the other side after you get thrown over there. It's gonna be
[5656.74s -> 5661.74s]  It actually might not be that hard if you if we do it like I throw you kind of in the air like this
[5661.78s -> 5667.40s]  I think here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think
[5667.40s -> 5669.40s]  Here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think when I'm swinging around
[5669.48s -> 5671.48s]  Yeah, and I'm slightly above it
[5671.60s -> 5685.85s]  You need to let go so you're dropping pulls me down and then I grab the other side and so I'm like here
[5687.28s -> 5692.64s]  Kind of rare kind of kind of kind of kind of I don't I feel like this isn't the way to do it and we're gonna
[5692.64s -> 5701.40s]  Get like the advanced version of this and we're not gonna be we're just gonna be I don't know what we're gonna be
[5702.28s -> 5712.64s]  Hey, I'm gonna do it like shit, there's no way that both way grab both climb and run
[5714.28s -> 5734.71s]  There's climbing what I mean climbing. I don't think you can climb you replace stir with penis music
[5734.71s -> 5742.52s]  You mean to round out stir with penis music that be wouldn't be able to hear his call out. Just climb just climb
[5743.04s -> 5764.65s]  Okay, you hold on you hold it. Whoa. Hold on a minute again. Hey, hold on stay there. Hey, let go
[5764.65s -> 5767.52s]  I almost had it. That was close
[5768.08s -> 5777.82s]  That was very close. It's not what ready
[5778.34s -> 5783.59s]  Let go now. Oh my god. I had it. I just should have jumped the other way
[5784.11s -> 5804.04s]  They're eating her then they're gonna eat me. We got ready shit. That's it. I'm the third swing
[5804.32s -> 5812.34s]  Do you want to do it? Do you want me to do it? You do it? I'm the grabber. That's one
[5813.00s -> 5815.48s]  Do you do the third one you're in the perfect spot?
[5817.33s -> 5823.58s]  Mmm, I heard but then I don't get I don't get it. I don't get when you're on there. It's just gonna break
[5824.06s -> 5834.00s]  And I'm dangling unless you like perfectly grab the left side without ever standing on it. Just do it swing again. I'm here
[5845.41s -> 5862.26s]  Yeah, the left wall has to get grabbed you grab okay one two three
[5864.19s -> 5872.98s]  Hell yeah. All right. Hold on. Well, that was weird it bumped me. Yeah, we got it. Nice
[5873.50s -> 5886.17s]  All right, you can open your eyes. Okay, there's a wooden horizontal over there
[5886.45s -> 5889.49s]  Yeah, I think I just get to that and a built-in timing
[5894.98s -> 5899.99s]  The jump was uh
[5899.99s -> 5918.04s]  Weird. Oh, man. We should have put a no, we don't need it. I hear you. That's weird one two three
[5919.82s -> 5922.31s]  Easy
[5922.31s -> 5923.83s]  Honestly, whoa
[5923.83s -> 5926.15s]  Honestly, I don't know why people would have trouble with that
[5926.43s -> 5939.26s]  Like I don't know why anyone would get here and like not be able to do that first try one two
[5940.24s -> 5941.99s]  three
[5942.27s -> 5948.86s]  Okay
[5949.10s -> 5957.15s]  Keep going
[5958.07s -> 5965.27s]  Wow, all you had to do is let go I was freaking out. Can you put down a everybody close their eyes flag?
[5965.27s -> 5975.88s]  I don't see anything right now. What um, how high can we jump?
[5975.88s -> 5981.64s]  We got to jump up to the right one then to the left one. Can we make that? Yeah, I'm here
[5981.64s -> 5993.06s]  Yeah, I don't know about that one. These do I what's over here?
[5993.68s -> 5995.20s]  nothing, oh
[5995.20s -> 5998.65s]  Where does that go? Oh, let's jump on it. Oh
[6006.47s -> 6011.67s]  Jeepers how in tarnation did you get up here? It must have been a tough journey. Am I right kids?
[6012.23s -> 6017.67s]  The seal by golly. It ain't mine, but we are closer than two catfish in a skillet
[6017.67s -> 6020.63s]  Now her name is Gertrude. How would I know?
[6023.31s -> 6027.28s]  This guy's a fucking nobody
[6027.76s -> 6036.09s]  That timing is not right. Can you pull me up?
[6036.89s -> 6057.32s]  You pull me up. I mean, let's just try it
[6057.52s -> 6062.20s]  Yeah, the worst that happens is we fall and we built in timing just back up here to the right
[6068.02s -> 6071.97s]  falling down on that one
[6071.97s -> 6086.61s]  Like a pro. Okay
[6087.92s -> 6092.56s]  Soon as it clicks into the top, we're gonna jump. Yeah, and I'm gonna grab in the right side
[6111.46s -> 6113.46s]  What the fuck?
[6115.66s -> 6125.32s]  There are no stakes anymore
[6125.32s -> 6127.32s]  Matter
[6128.04s -> 6141.58s]  You don't don't drop it. Okay, I'm gonna count it down one two three
[6152.43s -> 6175.48s]  Close your eyes nice. Oh my accolades my accolades we were a little too underneath
[6180.62s -> 6182.62s]  Actually, no grab
[6183.29s -> 6186.97s]  No, just call the key to and get us the fuck back up there, please
[6197.85s -> 6214.73s]  Accolades, okay. We stand on the right side of this thing. We keep bumping our heads two
[6215.29s -> 6225.80s]  Three you gotta let you gotta let me go. No, I don't yeah
[6225.80s -> 6231.60s]  That's all that's all you you gotta let me go. All right, this is built-in timing, but we have to be careful
[6232.00s -> 6234.20s]  Okay, this is a jump. Yes, I
[6239.60s -> 6245.39s]  Get it now, but oh my god, if I put my brain on like a 50 millisecond delay
[6245.39s -> 6251.25s]  We are perfectly in sync. Those jumps were like jump. Wait jump
[6251.57s -> 6258.33s]  Wait jump and it was perfect. Yeah, that's how I that's how you make sure that you can be together
[6258.33s -> 6263.77s]  I'm not in timing is when you land you just jump to the next one because you've already landed. Yes
[6264.09s -> 6268.11s]  That's not what that was
[6268.55s -> 6274.35s]  Yeah, I know but you're where point five with 50 milliseconds behind any other anyways, okay
[6274.35s -> 6281.70s]  No, it's more like it's it's more than 50 you do understand that even you talking through discord is coming through
[6281.70s -> 6286.52s]  No, it's more than it's more than 50. It's like a half a second. It's like jump
[6286.64s -> 6293.56s]  Okay, confirm. We've both landed have a cognitive. I understand. Okay now jump. It's not like jump land jump land
[6293.56s -> 6297.68s]  Yeah, it's it's not that it is not this it is jump boom
[6297.68s -> 6306.06s]  I didn't know that you were doing that this whole time when you say like built-in timing these things fall
[6306.06s -> 6309.14s]  It's like okay jump, but you have to get like the jump has to land
[6309.14s -> 6314.61s]  We have to make sure we've land the jump first, but it only takes that long to know
[6314.61s -> 6318.61s]  Yeah, but but here's the thing. I you don't know because that's what you gotta like see it. It'd be like, yes
[6318.61s -> 6321.33s]  Okay, we've lined it. Yeah, but you understand that we're doing this together
[6321.69s -> 6327.01s]  So we both need to land boom land, but like you have to built-in timing built-in timing
[6327.57s -> 6331.37s]  Timing is we we are both landing at the same time already
[6331.37s -> 6335.57s]  That's why we don't need to wait for the other person to land because the jump what it's not in timing
[6336.57s -> 6339.97s]  Timing is when you land we've done it line the whole time
[6341.81s -> 6348.08s]  It's there's no you're okay. You're making it sound like it's like land pause land. No
[6350.00s -> 6358.00s]  Let's go back go back to the checkpoint. Okay. Now. Let's do it my way
[6359.52s -> 6362.86s]  The moment you land we're just immediately going okay
[6367.70s -> 6374.64s]  No, but it's fucked up. It's fucked up because yes, it is. Yes. I am do it go back and do it again ready
[6375.02s -> 6382.89s]  Why were you slow that time because I thought we were doing German time. No, no
[6382.89s -> 6390.60s]  No, that's not what I said do your time your time. Okay, my time. That's not enough time
[6390.60s -> 6397.68s]  That's not enough time because like that's you we synchronized with the three two one go and then after that it's automatic time
[6399.12s -> 6403.00s]  Not pause reps, there's no it's not a pause rep. It's a
[6403.92s -> 6404.88s]  confirmation
[6404.88s -> 6407.36s]  50 milliseconds to make sure we've actually landed
[6407.60s -> 6411.89s]  It's it's a confirmation if you jump jump jump jump jump. What if you miss?
[6411.89s -> 6413.63s]  What if you know, you're gonna make sure you're in a nice spot
[6413.63s -> 6420.34s]  We could if you miss you already missed there's no need to stand still and confirm you've missed
[6420.34s -> 6426.88s]  It's good. No, it's a confirmation. Okay, so in the future are we doing pause reps or are we doing like gamer reps?
[6426.88s -> 6433.20s]  What the gamer reps to me is a mistake in a game like look in any other scenario?
[6433.20s -> 6437.94s]  I would agree with you in a game like this. You have to confer you put something in my eye
[6437.94s -> 6443.52s]  What did you do to my eye? All right, you ready? Got him. Got him. Hey. Hey, what the fuck dude? What are you doing?
[6443.52s -> 6446.34s]  Are you ready? We're going
[6447.12s -> 6448.52s]  germapace
[6448.52s -> 6456.48s]  But we we did not even confirm that that was our different your timing of like go go go go
[6456.48s -> 6461.41s]  I'm on beats right like
[6462.92s -> 6467.16s]  I'm on when you actually land is what your needs to occur. You're like
[6467.68s -> 6472.67s]  No, you gotta be on a tempo. It's gonna be like you're not doing a tempo
[6473.31s -> 6478.23s]  Say there are it's not a sound thing. It's a visual. I have jumped
[6478.23s -> 6481.87s]  I'm like it's as soon as you can jump jump. All right, but here's the jump
[6482.15s -> 6488.80s]  All right before you make everybody leave the stream with your with your incessant anger towards me and you're bickering
[6489.24s -> 6492.91s]  Have we had a problem this whole time? Yes
[6493.39s -> 6497.57s]  Since when I think that problem has come up several times. We've never fallen our jump
[6498.91s -> 6503.91s]  That jump was a little bit messed up like here is the first time I noticed it because it's a very clearly these things will
[6503.95s -> 6510.48s]  Fall and you need to go across them as quickly as possible German mights who's with me stir Mata
[6511.04s -> 6513.60s]  Get in the battlements
[6513.60s -> 6521.36s]  Shoot the cannons at the stir Mata. All right, you ready? Can we do this and uh, what happened there?
[6521.36s -> 6523.36s]  Mr. Super timing mr. Perfect timing
[6536.80s -> 6549.48s]  What is you're just fuck with me now he's fucking with me I was
[6551.94s -> 6561.40s]  Pull me up it's slippery. I okay
[6562.84s -> 6566.96s]  Automatically did a germapause rep on that one. We didn't have a plan. We didn't have a plan
[6566.96s -> 6571.96s]  What do you mean? We we've done this jump sixty times. We didn't we didn't have a plan
[6572.56s -> 6576.62s]  Fifty percent of the game is this and why did you just jump right there, sir?
[6577.22s -> 6580.18s]  Because I'm having an aneurysm our fall
[6586.24s -> 6593.42s]  That was wait that was not us it was
[6594.06s -> 6599.17s]  No, that was like our toes got stuck. It's because it's slippery
[6599.95s -> 6602.26s]  No, that's not what it was
[6602.54s -> 6609.50s]  That was like our toes got stuck on the edge and we didn't jump forward pause. I
[6610.42s -> 6615.34s]  Haven't even been doing that. You're just making it seem like I don't know what I'm doing and that's not exactly anything that happened
[6615.34s -> 6622.22s]  I think it was very clearly demonstrated exactly what you were doing. I think everyone is seen. We took a poll

[6722.87s -> 6724.87s]  We can jump on it. You know how to jump on this. Yes
[6732.60s -> 6736.42s]  What do we go from there? You gotta wait till it gets to the top and jump, right? Oh

[6790.83s -> 6795.23s]  You didn't jump. No, I got my head stuck on the rope. Don't run it back
[6795.23s -> 6808.97s]  I don't think we can even make this jump run it back, dude
[6809.29s -> 6812.44s]  You you got we gotta get a look at it first
[6813.14s -> 6820.20s]  It's it's built-in timing. It's germapause rep built-in timing when it when we lock in left we go
[6821.04s -> 6830.43s]  Onto the Metroid block. I feel like I've been doing it like that the whole time
[6833.96s -> 6835.96s]  built-in what are you oh

[6919.59s -> 6936.03s]  Okay, just wait wait wait wait once it ends we go once that's just just anchor and then once that once the next one ends
[6936.75s -> 6943.75s]  Um, hold on like I have been like hands been like this on the arrow keys the whole time on my right hand
[6944.15s -> 6963.96s]  Okay next also. We didn't really talk about that either
[6964.72s -> 6966.96s]  Okay, anchor. We didn't talk about that either
[6967.56s -> 6973.08s]  I'm using my right hand to play this game. You're using your left hand. You're used to your left. I'm being used
[6973.08s -> 6981.44s]  I got your anchor. Just keep it. I just keep it anchored. Think about that. I am NOT doing WASD because I can't
[6983.54s -> 6991.12s]  Just anchor we need upper. Yeah, we're gonna need to do a spin jump. Why am I getting question-marked? Were you here earlier?
[6991.64s -> 7005.38s]  Do dude what we need to okay, right? Thank her. I'm I'm
[7005.94s -> 7010.14s]  What is this about a left hand that you can't your brain?

[7016.82s -> 7021.78s]  You're on you you're using WASD with your left hand. That is what you are used to using when you play a video game
[7021.90s -> 7027.94s]  I'm your right hand being on arrow keys is a different muscle memory. Can I give you like a word of advice?
[7028.66s -> 7033.44s]  No, can you put your left hand on the arrow keys?
[7033.44s -> 7037.96s]  But that's weird because like I'm crossing my body and then but I feel like turn the kid. That's weird
[7038.56s -> 7048.38s]  That's weird. Like at that point. I would have to like move my seat. It's weird

[7072.84s -> 7086.43s]  Let's try top right if we fall we fall. Okay, let me get to where you are first though move the keyboard
[7086.43s -> 7090.74s]  I don't have that's like I don't have a room to do that
[7091.34s -> 7097.10s]  Right anchor. We're gonna okay as soon as this next win ends. We're gonna do the big jump
[7097.66s -> 7102.67s]  Stop fucking pulling me. Well, what are you doing?
[7103.55s -> 7107.47s]  I need to get a full rotation so we can jump across. I know but we have to wait till the wind is gone
[7107.47s -> 7111.07s]  Yeah, so why do you keep interrupting me because I'm getting the rotations going
[7112.27s -> 7118.47s]  Okay, you ready? Don't do it. I'm not going to I'm ready cuz I can go while the winds going for some reason

[7266.38s -> 7274.40s]  Everyone is a little freak out. That's usually you time it. I'm just gonna go back
[7275.48s -> 7277.48s]  Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, just go back
[7278.47s -> 7280.47s]  You you've timed it the last few times
[7280.99s -> 7285.80s]  Once the wind ends, I know but you've done like the din din
[7287.08s -> 7296.72s]  Thought you were gonna go for it. Greedy. Greedy

[7323.00s -> 7329.68s]  You're really gonna pull that I don't know what that means
[7332.68s -> 7334.60s]  What is this I
[7334.60s -> 7340.04s]  We have to jump with the wind. We gotta jump probably probably and then I have to throw you with the wind
[7340.40s -> 7350.44s]  That's definitely what this is. Okay. So now I gotta throw you with the wind. Hold on. Let me get in a better spot
[7350.96s -> 7357.59s]  Okay, wait for the wind. I'm gonna go when it starts to blow in three two. No
[7358.15s -> 7363.85s]  Don't tell me no when I'm confident. Don't tell this guy. No
[7364.17s -> 7376.51s]  All right, freeze was what did we do? No, you're so sassy. I
[7377.57s -> 7379.57s]  Think that we jump on this platform
[7380.17s -> 7383.46s]  Nah
[7383.46s -> 7387.06s]  Hold on. Okay, we need to see how long it was gonna stay there for
[7387.58s -> 7394.49s]  Why we thought six times? Oh, it's to get one more rotation
[7395.49s -> 7397.29s]  I'm not I don't feel comfortable about this
[7397.29s -> 7401.73s]  But you don't you want to get it right or do you want to get it wrong and I have people omega low and have a
[7402.21s -> 7417.97s]  Thumbnail pull me up. Hey, is your refrigerator running? Yeah, I think so you got me
[7417.97s -> 7430.77s]  I have to throw you I gotta throw you to that in the wind
[7430.77s -> 7435.14s]  You got to grab it and then we got to go. What the fuck just happened. Are you ready?
[7437.42s -> 7442.23s]  One more I
[7442.23s -> 7447.57s]  Won this thing moves in the wind. I don't think I'm gonna be able to keep my momentum. Yeah, that kills it
[7447.99s -> 7455.46s]  So you're gonna start when we're on our way to the left. I can't like I'm we're not gonna be able to get 360s
[7455.46s -> 7467.59s]  But the wind will take us further. Okay, so right now I think it's like that. All right, it's the Lakita up there
[7468.13s -> 7484.28s]  Yeah, this is ruining my morning. You both suck. What what's going on?
[7486.76s -> 7497.24s]  Wait, what do you mean? Where are you? Where are you? All right ready? I'm like exhausted
[7498.04s -> 7501.12s]  I've been pushed to my limit
[7502.84s -> 7508.90s]  All right now I'm gonna swing you ready one more
[7509.40s -> 7524.18s]  No, okay one more. I gripped it. But why did that happen? I actually gripped it and he just went I hurt
[7524.18s -> 7526.18s]  I heard it that does happen sometimes
[7526.82s -> 7530.38s]  That's why you need the lucky to look Lakota. I
[7530.90s -> 7532.46s]  Grew the yoko
[7532.46s -> 7538.72s]  We're gonna instantly go instantly. That would be better as soon as it comes down. Yep
[7539.20s -> 7551.24s]  So how we need more momentum on this one? How do we get it? Because if I do it there, it won't work
[7551.60s -> 7563.08s]  There we go. Give me one more. Give me one more one more. You got it. My fingers fell off the muscle fucking man
[7563.08s -> 7570.48s]  We're good. We landed. Oh my god. Why did we both just not do anything? That's not where we're going, right?
[7570.80s -> 7576.76s]  That's not where we're going
[7576.76s -> 7578.76s]  Because we we've been
[7578.80s -> 7588.89s]  Alright, let me get it two more one more right there
[7589.71s -> 7592.89s]  All right
[7594.17s -> 7598.06s]  There you go, I can't I can't
[7598.82s -> 7601.77s]  We're gonna jump when the wind comes. Yep. Oh
[7607.35s -> 7609.35s]  No, no, no. Oh
[7609.91s -> 7611.91s]  Let's just walk the other way
[7612.27s -> 7614.27s]  But we didn't see what was up there
[7614.83s -> 7623.94s]  You were gonna fall off too. You were gonna fall the fuck off you if I didn't fall you're so happy that I felt
[7626.94s -> 7632.54s]  It's just gotten worse and you think we'd get better at this shit. Let me just take a look and see what my hand looks like
[7632.54s -> 7634.78s]  Oh boy, that's uh
[7635.66s -> 7637.62s]  That's not good
[7637.62s -> 7657.77s]  What is not good? I did a thing. That's millennial humor, which both Millennials. Okay. Sorry
[7658.45s -> 7666.94s]  Next one. Yeah, one wasn't right. Give me two more. Ah
[7669.70s -> 7682.99s]  Thank you. All right. All right next win starts. So we're just gonna go go go go go. Mm-hmm. Okay, you got it
[7689.24s -> 7691.76s]  Jesus. All right. Now I gotta throw you over there
[7698.18s -> 7699.86s]  Jesus, okay
[7699.86s -> 7710.40s]  This is further than you thought we'd get right 270. I I thought we I thought we were gonna quit the game like an hour
[7710.40s -> 7716.80s]  And a half ago. All right. What's the plan here? Let's jump. Uh, yeah
[7723.60s -> 7725.60s]  I can we make I don't know
[7726.44s -> 7728.74s]  I think we do the running one
[7729.22s -> 7731.10s]  the other side
[7731.10s -> 7738.94s]  Nice, uh, and then when the wind starts, we're gonna have to do a jump. Yep
[7739.46s -> 7751.74s]  Whoa, I overshot it the first time
[7752.50s -> 7757.58s]  Let's jump straight up
[7757.58s -> 7760.66s]  Can we make the left one? I gotta wait for the wind
[7761.67s -> 7762.47s]  Oops
[7762.47s -> 7764.75s]  Are you doing as soon as the wind hits?
[7765.31s -> 7772.82s]  You fucked it up. I you didn't jump. I did they didn't but I was pulling you I was pulling you it's like off
[7773.06s -> 7780.52s]  Sink it's weird when I fall. It's my fault when you fall. It's weird a full straight run
[7780.92s -> 7801.78s]  No, when the wind starts when the wind starts, I just straight up straight up when the wind starts
[7810.32s -> 7820.89s]  All right, you grabbing or am I grabbing I think we can make the job grab
[7821.25s -> 7836.91s]  Okay, I'll grab these I'll grab it you grab the other one. Okay, let go here. Oh fuck. Yep
[7837.35s -> 7839.23s]  Good thing you were a little bit further
[7839.23s -> 7844.61s]  All right. What's the plan here? I guess it's that
[7851.43s -> 7852.91s]  What
[7852.91s -> 7863.49s]  Troll dumb just get us back. What what what?
[7865.99s -> 7867.15s]  burger
[7867.15s -> 7870.97s]  Sounds good
[7870.97s -> 7881.66s]  Double jump does it blow with the wind? I think we got it
[7881.66s -> 7883.66s]  We got to do it when it's above our head
[7884.30s -> 7890.81s]  No shit, that's weird
[7890.81s -> 7894.77s]  What the heck? I got you. I got you baby boo-boo
[7896.55s -> 7906.72s]  Can you pull me up? I keep swinging. I don't trust that. No, I'm the swinger
[7907.48s -> 7913.80s]  Okay, I'm gonna go right when we oh, no, I think you have to start doing it down here
[7914.28s -> 7917.76s]  Yeah, cuz the winds gonna mess it up
[7917.76s -> 7922.60s]  It's my hitting my head on the corner is what it is. I'm gonna move to the right a little more. I got it
[7924.61s -> 7929.04s]  No
[7929.04s -> 7931.04s]  Let me move to the right a little bit more
[7931.56s -> 7939.12s]  See if that does it. Mm-hmm. I've got it. Trust trust. Okay
[7939.76s -> 7952.58s]  I'm gonna go on this one. Okay. Oh
[7954.07s -> 7955.35s]  No, what?
[7955.35s -> 7965.36s]  Go jump anchor
[7967.04s -> 7969.04s]  anchor in this stanker
[7985.94s -> 7990.54s]  That was kind of like a I just I'm piecing together what you just said
[7991.46s -> 7992.98s]  Going on this one
[7992.98s -> 7995.16s]  We're gonna go gotta go gotta go gotta go gotta go
[8000.87s -> 8018.03s]  Okay after the wind. Yeah, we should get a countdown there pink for the clouds purple for the mountains. Uh-huh
[8018.03s -> 8019.91s]  I'm starting to visualize it
[8019.91s -> 8027.91s]  They're actually like it's hard to climb this and there's so many people up here solo. I don't like that lore
[8028.43s -> 8036.44s]  How much further is coming? I wonder come here for a run and jump
[8036.88s -> 8045.32s]  Wait, we need the wind and also it seems like if you stand behind this wall, the wind doesn't affect you. Oh
[8046.18s -> 8047.38s]  It doesn't
[8047.38s -> 8052.21s]  Wait, I didn't I know that was weird start at late. So I decided to call it
[8052.81s -> 8057.94s]  Okay, when the wind starts I called it. Yeah
[8058.84s -> 8064.49s]  You're for the best. You're not even on the ground. I got it. I got it again. I got it. All right
[8064.49s -> 8073.30s]  I thought we may have kept moving not risking it
[8073.74s -> 8078.64s]  All right, so you grab and then you want me to grab the other side of the wall? Yeah
[8079.64s -> 8083.84s]  Right now mid wind
[8084.12s -> 8091.75s]  I'm not you're grabbing right you go you go. Yeah. All right. I'm going to grab the other side
[8097.84s -> 8103.72s]  What that was a buggy bug bug that was a bug bug bug that was a bug that was a bug it was a bug
[8103.72s -> 8126.49s]  I was a bug. That was that was a bug. That's a bug. I wasn't even holding on to the side. Just go second one. Okay, I
[8127.49s -> 8129.49s]  Let's wait for this
[8130.60s -> 8132.93s]  Platform go

[8139.29s -> 8143.33s]  We're up 250 meters this mountain first try. We've never done this before
[8143.33s -> 8145.69s]  I was concerned that if I was gonna throw you too far
[8146.29s -> 8160.33s]  You fucking dunce. That's not a dunce scenario. That's uh, you
[8160.97s -> 8164.90s]  You didn't even anchor. I'm the dunce
[8165.74s -> 8168.68s]  You got up there and you stood there
[8169.48s -> 8174.68s]  I'm the dunce. I'm the dunce though. You're gonna let go of the wall. You didn't anchor
[8178.60s -> 8180.48s]  you dunce
[8180.48s -> 8186.75s]  I'm gonna get it. No, you're not
[8186.79s -> 8190.88s]  But if you what have you done?

[8231.60s -> 8233.60s]  Do one go?
[8241.20s -> 8243.51s]  Pull me up
[8245.87s -> 8253.69s]  Thanks, dude, feel bad. I was gonna say moron, but he didn't deserve it. Wait, we need wind
[8257.86s -> 8267.60s]  Are you gonna make that jump without wind you're doing the countdown
[8268.36s -> 8270.36s]  That doesn't mean you jump
[8270.36s -> 8283.73s]  He's doing the countdown this countdown. This countdown is real. Oh, you don't need it. That was slippery
[8284.29s -> 8286.79s]  It sure was buster

[8345.07s -> 8365.05s]  But then we're gonna stop there because we need to swing. Yes, we're too big. We'll jump. Yes, we do. I got it
[8365.17s -> 8374.39s]  What are you doing? Okay

[8459.57s -> 8464.63s]  So all all the way over. Okay, let's I'll count it. I'll count it down
[8464.71s -> 8467.23s]  If we need to count it because we're connected to each other at the hip
[8469.82s -> 8476.01s]  God, I wish we weren't or were okay. That was always cuz it was because we're good. That's time
[8476.01s -> 8479.53s]  It was in time, right? I did it. It just didn't do it
[8488.16s -> 8495.35s]  It's fucking hard. Okay, just just chill just chill. It's gonna blow us off

[8533.91s -> 8535.43s]  Yeah
[8535.43s -> 8538.02s]  If we don't do it this time, it's red
[8539.74s -> 8549.18s]  Hey, you fell off you fell off because you decided to anchor instead of walking to the right on the ice
[8549.18s -> 8551.38s]  Can you say Barney loud for me?
[8553.46s -> 8555.83s]  Actually, I'm warning
[8555.87s -> 8558.50s]  Barney Barney Barney
[8559.18s -> 8568.06s]  Different I think um, we gotta get back up to the top red. This is not even hard. We've done way harder things
[8568.62s -> 8578.06s]  Pretty good. Yeah, just wait. We've got the road. We're rushing through this. No, we're not
[8578.46s -> 8592.14s]  We're you the wind once it starts do not anchor on ice, but sometimes it gives you an extra little boost. No
[8593.02s -> 8594.54s]  No
[8594.54s -> 8613.93s]  nice Mike
[8614.93s -> 8616.93s]  But you were silent

[8624.29s -> 8627.17s]  You didn't say anything, but you just said uh, we're gonna get different
[8627.69s -> 8657.66s]  Keep going. I'm ready. I'm just calling me a piece of shit
[8661.04s -> 8669.44s]  But here is the conundrum you are you are way ahead of me. Do you get it now?
[8669.52s -> 8677.08s]  No, because I'm throwing you bro. I'm throwing you I think we could just make this jump to the right
[8677.64s -> 8693.28s]  Yeah, when I throw you you are like a full you're a full rope length ahead of me
[8693.70s -> 8710.39s]  All right, so we're gonna read a full fully documented plan. I'm sending you the email right now. Okay, what's what's in it?
[8710.39s -> 8718.55s]  It's a subject keep going. Just keep walking right don't anchor on ice
[8719.31s -> 8734.66s]  Keep going timing keep going. I got it. We're going left. We're going left anchor you anchor. I
[8736.30s -> 8745.75s]  Don't we need to do that. Yes. This is bad. This is gonna be horrible. Oh dear. Oh

[8754.49s -> 8756.49s]  I feel like I'm gonna go flying past
[8757.01s -> 8759.01s]  Oh bother
[8778.77s -> 8784.85s]  Regular job, let's wait for the wind
[8786.09s -> 8792.85s]  Uh-huh. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow
[8794.17s -> 8796.47s]  Wow

[8837.53s -> 8842.63s]  You got this I'm ready. Are you ready?
[8849.95s -> 8855.09s]  It's we're doing like the family guy fall down thing
[8855.29s -> 8858.14s]  Oh
[8858.14s -> 8864.04s]  What's the fucking family are running right once the wind hits? Oh
[8865.08s -> 8873.17s]  Right. I don't know. What do we do there? I think we're doing it wrong
[8880.61s -> 8882.65s]  We can both jump and grab the wall, ah
[8883.73s -> 8890.00s]  But why?
[8890.04s -> 8900.90s]  So that's the thing the floor doesn't break when the wind comes when the wind comes now. Well, it'll respawn. Oh
[8901.54s -> 8903.50s]  What a smart?
[8903.50s -> 8907.32s]  You got it. Just
[8907.32s -> 8912.00s]  We got a smart ass over here. You are kind of a no, you're not you're fine
[8912.64s -> 8925.87s]  no, I
[8927.19s -> 8930.99s]  Know but I just thought of like the grimace birth thing again, and it's like fuck with me
[8936.77s -> 8938.13s]  Month-long
[8938.13s -> 8940.77s]  What's up? It's I don't even know what to say
[8941.45s -> 8960.05s]  Okay, say less. Is this a throw scenario? Yeah, I'm gonna move up a little no actually we're good. No
[8960.71s -> 8964.70s]  Right keep walking, right?
[8964.70s -> 8978.03s]  Keep walking, right? I am I am. Oh, I don't know what you did. I forgot to give the second instruction
[8978.73s -> 9005.28s]  Stop walking, right? Hey, what if I threw him right now? I forgot to give the second instruction stop walking, right? Yeah, I
[9006.78s -> 9011.26s]  Okay, so let's like just like pause when we're on the ice because apparently we're doing a lot of germa pause reps
[9011.26s -> 9014.86s]  I love how this all comes back to me doing this somehow
[9015.50s -> 9023.34s]  but
[9023.34s -> 9024.54s]  pause
[9024.54s -> 9035.47s]  nice
[9035.47s -> 9037.29s]  Smooth
[9037.29s -> 9038.45s]  Smooth
[9038.45s -> 9048.26s]  No, no, no, no the winds are Howard Howard Howard. We would have gotten going on Howard Howard Howard
[9048.86s -> 9052.29s]  It says three two one go. That's when you go
[9052.93s -> 9056.84s]  Give it a second. We don't do well that
[9057.52s -> 9060.53s]  Did you shave your eyebrows?
[9060.53s -> 9066.05s]  No, I probably need to I probably need to do some cleanup on my eyebrows though. They're probably fucking filthy
[9077.96s -> 9081.96s]  One of us to get it. I want to hear I want to hear it. Don't talk. We're gonna do this. Oh
[9100.10s -> 9101.70s]  Let go
[9101.70s -> 9104.11s]  That's a lot of talking
[9104.11s -> 9119.02s]  Okay. Okay. I hate this. I hate this. We're going back. This is totally an optional room. I
[9119.78s -> 9129.02s]  Don't think it is. I think it is. I think we're waiting for the wind here to jump left. Okay, you say so
[9129.66s -> 9141.23s]  I'm gonna do a trick. Where do we go from? Oh
[9141.95s -> 9146.23s]  There's gonna be a tough one. It is
[9147.42s -> 9149.42s]  We just wait for the wind and I just do it normally
[9150.02s -> 9187.49s]  Like this dance you goober we got an achievement for that. Yeah. Yeah, how do we both miss that?
[9190.00s -> 9192.00s]  Call the taxi, whatever it is
[9194.13s -> 9201.18s]  Hey me Lords, have you tried waiting for each other to jump you have a dent in your head?
[9205.42s -> 9209.80s]  Was that you reading a comment cuz I thought you were responding to that person I was like that
[9210.04s -> 9212.04s]  He wouldn't usually go in like that
[9212.68s -> 9215.36s]  Thought you meant that was you thought I was talking to you
[9216.12s -> 9221.32s]  No, what you read the comment the guy said why don't you try waiting to jump and you were just like hey
[9221.32s -> 9229.18s]  You got a dent in your head. I didn't realize it was a back-to-back comment
[9231.94s -> 9234.78s]  That's true that sounded so fucked up that was
[9246.20s -> 9250.72s]  Okay
[9251.92s -> 9254.70s]  The our continuation of the let's play
[9257.74s -> 9259.74s]  Okay, ready. Yeah
[9261.80s -> 9267.24s]  Trashing he's turning purple. Where's my countdown? Oh
[9270.06s -> 9274.35s]  Sensory overload the winds not even here you don't
[9275.51s -> 9279.11s]  Sensory over and stop my fault. There's too many noises
[9282.12s -> 9286.72s]  Death in your head
[9287.16s -> 9291.26s]  Hold on fucking rude. That's so fucking like horrible
[9292.68s -> 9300.86s]  Why can't we do this anymore? I think we got a jump a little later. Oh
[9301.54s -> 9305.00s]  We're like, we're being very conservative with our jump
[9305.60s -> 9320.78s]  Okay, we said how is your hair middle and side parted?
[9324.04s -> 9328.20s]  Get it. I don't get it. You got a dent in your head. I don't know maybe
[9328.88s -> 9334.42s]  Is it is it? I can't I need to look I got I got it. I got it
[9334.94s -> 9343.08s]  Hold hold hold hold here. You stop. Um, stop fucking around
[9343.52s -> 9349.08s]  What do you mean stop fucking around? You just fell off twice and you've been around so much. Stop you fucking around
[9349.08s -> 9357.53s]  It's I'm the spinner. Yeah, but we need to assess what's going on with this situation ahead of us. There is a
[9358.37s -> 9364.34s]  Okay, I get it. You're ready. I've been ready. I wasn't though and it's a team game
[9366.56s -> 9368.56s]  It's a team game and I wasn't
[9372.59s -> 9380.12s]  I didn't think we were gonna make it. I can't believe you did the tutorial of red dead 2 and just be like this game's dumb
[9380.12s -> 9383.90s]  I didn't finish it. I just saved your life
[9384.54s -> 9390.40s]  Well, we should have double jumped why we don't just went cuz we're on a fucking time limit
[9390.90s -> 9410.38s]  Go go. Oh, this is it. We're almost the end. What are you doing? All right
[9410.94s -> 9417.28s]  You'd like the ghost took over the computer for a second. What are you doing? I was wondering if that was affecting you
[9417.76s -> 9423.79s]  Huh, I was adjusting my music volume. Oh, I turned it way down already
[9431.53s -> 9434.67s]  Three two one go I bumped my head on it
[9435.79s -> 9443.26s]  Yeah, gaga Google. Oh you want to go? No. No, you said stay in our lanes, right?
[9443.26s -> 9452.56s]  Like do what we know what we're doing with the without it's definitely without or is it is it with or without?
[9453.40s -> 9455.00s]  it's with
[9455.00s -> 9461.82s]  Wait, it might not be I guess it is. Okay
[9462.46s -> 9467.53s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, pull me up. Pull me up. I'm a little baby
[9468.65s -> 9470.80s]  Yeah, oh
[9470.80s -> 9475.52s]  I see you want to put a checkpoint after every jump now because you want to be done with this game that you despise so
[9475.52s -> 9478.17s]  much I
[9478.17s -> 9485.52s]  Get you. Yep. Holy shit. Okay. Well because look at you
[9486.14s -> 9491.46s]  Look at you look in the mirror. You're I wouldn't be able to finish this one you ever
[9492.14s -> 9498.94s]  I'm looking in the mirror. What is it something my face? What's what my fucking hair? I have the double part. What's going on?
[9498.94s -> 9510.20s]  I think we could practice this game for an eternity and without checkpoints. It would never end. Uh,
[9511.98s -> 9521.28s]  I felt the same way by the game only up and it was so hard and then I started watching people do like
[9522.52s -> 9527.08s]  15 minutes speed runs of that game and yet that was on you that was I don't know where we're going after that
[9527.60s -> 9543.35s]  Tbh, whoa, that was weird. I've been comparing only up to dark and darker and I can see how you would like them both
[9543.59s -> 9550.37s]  What what do you mean explain I don't think I should
[9552.72s -> 9555.28s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[9555.64s -> 9583.17s]  What do you mean explain? Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. They're both unfinished streamer bait trash. Okay, it's been in the wrong way
[9583.17s -> 9597.95s]  All right, just hold tight on me up. Okay. Now, where we going against the wind when it comes go left
[9598.47s -> 9601.28s]  Nice. Okay. Okay
[9601.76s -> 9611.36s]  Okay, um, I mean but can I ask you a question? Yeah, and you have to answer honestly
[9612.04s -> 9617.60s]  Mm-hmm. Can you name me three games that have come out in the last five years that you genuinely really enjoyed?
[9619.36s -> 9621.36s]  Yeah, what what are they?
[9623.23s -> 9630.76s]  Without looking up a like Google sheet of the game. I'm trying to look up something else. Did you play bet and brutal? No
[9632.03s -> 9635.87s]  Exactly. I rest my case
[9637.11s -> 9642.63s]  Drama Oh only up. I love only up. I'm gonna check out the speedruns. Oh and if these die play bet and brutal
[9642.63s -> 9646.16s]  No, I played only up for like four hours once
[9647.48s -> 9652.82s]  Exactly. I didn't when did I say that only up was the game of the year? I said
[9654.54s -> 9659.26s]  I said like like I said named a few games in the last five years that you genuinely enjoyed
[9659.62s -> 9663.62s]  In the last five years. Yeah name like three
[9663.86s -> 9669.56s]  Do they have to have released in the last five years or can I enjoy them? Yeah, like a game that's come a games
[9669.56s -> 9671.56s]  I've come out in the last like let's say three years
[9671.76s -> 9676.36s]  That you like really would like wow, I really enjoyed that you got to name me at least three
[9678.44s -> 9683.27s]  Elden ring Q remastered risk of rain to
[9684.63s -> 9693.45s]  Yep, I don't you can't which light infinite. You told me in private that you didn't like it. Didn't like what or tight I didn't
[9697.74s -> 9701.26s]  You're you're weird. Can I tell you why you're weird? Why am I weird?
[9701.26s -> 9705.90s]  Cuz you'll like okay, I brought up like pizza tower, right? Yeah, and I was like pizza tower
[9705.90s -> 9708.46s]  Oh, you should really try it. I think it's like one of the best games to come out this year
[9708.78s -> 9712.48s]  And you played it and you were like don't ever recommend me a game ever again
[9713.92s -> 9717.90s]  That's not what I said. I just said I it wasn't for me. I
[9720.62s -> 9721.70s]  respect
[9721.70s -> 9728.25s]  Pizza tower, but it is not for me. Okay, it may have been more
[9729.65s -> 9737.20s]  He was a little dramatic at the time. Well, hey, hey, why we're gonna have this whole conversation when I brought up Diablo 4 season 1
[9737.20s -> 9740.91s]  Early, you know, you didn't want to talk then. Oh, it was just a hater
[9744.07s -> 9748.75s]  Beloved game but love Diablo for the one of the greatest entries in the Diablo series pull up
[9748.75s -> 9749.95s]  Oh, you want to talk about it?
[9749.95s -> 9757.30s]  I just got really sick and tired of picking up Saigon's boots over and over and over again
[9757.82s -> 9761.60s]  You fucking wish that game would drop Saigon's boots. Yeah
[9779.46s -> 9788.95s]  Stir has horrid opinions. I don't think stir is horrid opinions stir and I actually agree on quite a lot chat
[9789.07s -> 9794.35s]  You're dying on the hill of only up a game that's getting fucking like destroyed for like
[9795.19s -> 9801.15s]  Non-fair use NFT shit in their game. You're dying on the hill of like no only up was good. What do you mean?
[9801.15s -> 9806.55s]  It's fun. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The game was fun. I enjoyed I enjoyed it
[9806.55s -> 9812.91s]  But the counterpoint is Ben brutal is the exact same game without all of the shovelware aspects
[9812.91s -> 9815.35s]  But you didn't try that and you tried the shovelware
[9815.83s -> 9825.33s]  That's all I'm saying nobody died on that hill you're fighting ghosts you're fighting ghosts
[9826.79s -> 9830.11s]  You're fighting ghosts. I'm just saying
[9831.07s -> 9836.64s]  two very similar games came out in a very similar time frame and
[9837.71s -> 9841.51s]  One of them deserves a an ounce of respect and you picked the wrong one
[9842.35s -> 9845.17s]  Let me I'll translate for those of you that don't know stir
[9846.03s -> 9848.91s]  He fell off the pipes and all dead for it get good
[9849.43s -> 9853.19s]  This is the I fell off the pipes and didn't want to go back up
[9855.86s -> 9865.80s]  This is drama destroying the environment by supporting. Okay, you ready? Okay, let's go. I
[9869.48s -> 9871.40s]  Forgot to press down
[9871.40s -> 9889.36s]  Three two. No, wait, I was good. You were watching my stream. I wasn't even on camera next time. It touches down. Yep. Nice
[9890.16s -> 9893.04s]  Next time it touches up. We're running, right? Oh
[9895.12s -> 9898.56s]  Oh, I quit in favelas
[9899.40s -> 9903.85s]  I'm here with you. I'm tied to you. I'm good playing it
[9904.29s -> 9908.89s]  What ever happened to next time it goes when it goes we're in the middle of we're in the middle of like a divorce
[9908.97s -> 9912.59s]  Level argument right now. So I need a second next time
[9913.77s -> 9916.17s]  My fingers left. Oh my
[9916.89s -> 9925.42s]  Three, what's all I got like oil on my fingers. What happened? Yeah when you're focusing on pulling me only up
[9926.78s -> 9931.38s]  He liked it the next time we touched up
[9931.94s -> 9935.72s]  You didn't do it
[9935.72s -> 9941.60s]  You were never gonna make that jump and you're counting on me to have made the jump so that you don't look dumb
[9946.09s -> 9961.85s]  This kid didn't even make it up pipes and only up it's also about season one. Let's hear about it
[9963.93s -> 9976.32s]  I gotta I guess I'm gonna be I you breaking up. Are you on a good cell signal? You breaking up? Yeah name five games
[9978.13s -> 9982.91s]  Super Mario 1 Super Mario 2 Super Mario World Super Mario 3 Super Mario 64
[9983.91s -> 9987.81s]  Best games of all time. Not even a fucking contention
[9988.39s -> 10002.51s]  Competition. Did you beat Super Mario World for SNES? Yes. Thank God actually. Thank God actually
[10003.19s -> 10007.54s]  Let's move that flag
[10010.54s -> 10020.42s]  Next time it touches down. I got you. I got you. I got you. I made it
[10023.82s -> 10036.60s]  Did you see the Mario fingers are just so oily it was funny when I did it and why are we counting now?
[10037.02s -> 10040.42s]  You did it. You did it. Are we counting you?
[10041.10s -> 10045.60s]  Stir he got that. There's a bird. That sounds like there's a bird in your room
[10045.60s -> 10047.90s]  I don't know if I heard what I heard was correct, but be careful out there
[10047.90s -> 10058.58s]  I heard a very large bird potentially you all right you there duck. All right, you're gonna comes down crouch
[10059.38s -> 10061.75s]  Next time we go up. I'm gonna count it down
[10062.55s -> 10065.17s]  My fingers are greasy
[10065.41s -> 10070.89s]  You didn't even go on look and look what I'm doing here. Look what I'm doing. I see what you're doing
[10070.89s -> 10076.34s]  I certainly see what you're doing. Okay. What's the plan here?
[10079.41s -> 10081.41s]  I know and
[10081.57s -> 10084.80s]  We come back. Yeah
[10084.80s -> 10091.52s]  We need we need one of these two. You can't put them here. Yeah put them on ice. Okay, so we need running start to
[10092.40s -> 10097.63s]  Okay
[10097.63s -> 10103.30s]  Okay, I like how we both just sit so we're going right pop right pop
[10105.08s -> 10117.51s]  After the next wind we're beating this. I thought you were gonna do a countdown
[10118.82s -> 10120.58s]  After the next wind
[10120.58s -> 10127.35s]  Can you jump could you know you pull me? Hey, you know, you're not doing the pole animation
[10127.95s -> 10140.04s]  Sorry, there's no signal in the tunnel. Okay, I guess I'll count it down for you
[10140.64s -> 10150.16s]  Nice whoo
[10150.64s -> 10157.62s]  All right, what the heck once it gets here? Yeah
[10158.46s -> 10160.51s]  Then we can go
[10160.51s -> 10172.12s]  Up and then duck and then I have to throw you to the left. I think I think this is a throw
[10172.12s -> 10174.62s]  I think this might is it a throw
[10175.20s -> 10181.16s]  Why not? Why not? Just why not just go all all out you show me your true power. I think it was a throw
[10187.92s -> 10194.12s]  It's 500 we're almost there and then then you can go play Diablo 4 so we all know you're fucking huge
[10194.12s -> 10199.66s]  You love that game. Well, apparently apparently I like games now
[10200.36s -> 10215.11s]  Apparently I like games now good save actually. I don't know if this gets us anywhere though. I think it kind of does
[10215.67s -> 10225.34s]  Well, we're gonna yeah, we're gonna have to jump next wind I think it makes sense to me
[10225.86s -> 10238.64s]  Boy, I was going by timing. Why are you guys fighting? Hey, it's good games
[10240.33s -> 10242.57s]  only up stir and I
[10243.13s -> 10247.74s]  Are very comfortable hanging out. We can just you know rifle off
[10248.50s -> 10253.70s]  Yeah, we I think we have a pretty good dynamic. We've known each other for a long time. I think we have a good dynamic
[10253.70s -> 10259.99s]  What do you think crap? That's it? Yes. Yeah, we have a great dynamic
[10260.75s -> 10263.12s]  We have a great dynamic
[10263.76s -> 10269.84s]  We know we know who is who we know who's wearing the fucking shoes in the relationship pants
[10270.36s -> 10274.84s]  That why what are you counting down?
[10275.16s -> 10280.01s]  What were you counting down? What were you doing? You knew that was a bad countdown
[10280.33s -> 10285.53s]  The next jump timed perfectly after the wind ended you knew that was a bad countdown
[10285.53s -> 10288.73s]  That was a view that you timed that wrong and you knew it. That's why you quiet
[10288.73s -> 10294.11s]  Usually you'd have been like turbo you're stupid it but that time you were dead silent because I thought
[10294.81s -> 10297.01s]  We've been doing this for like 14 hours
[10297.77s -> 10311.45s]  You ready on the next wind? Can you can you notice the wind occurring then we can just do it same exact thing?
[10311.45s -> 10312.81s]  We did last time
[10312.81s -> 10318.96s]  three two one go
[10320.43s -> 10322.43s]  It wasn't gonna work out that way. Oh
[10322.91s -> 10323.79s]  wasn't
[10323.79s -> 10327.31s]  No, we didn't do it before. I wasn't gonna work out that way
[10328.19s -> 10343.92s]  Bro, take a nap. You look tired. I mean I am but how dare you I think that's cuz we're doing that when the wind comes
[10343.92s -> 10345.36s]  I think so
[10345.36s -> 10348.75s]  three two one, uh
[10350.52s -> 10358.81s]  Zero, I don't think we need the wind for this. I think you're you're you're putting overwind compensation in here
[10358.81s -> 10361.69s]  I'm putting overwind. Okay, we're the winds gonna end
[10361.69s -> 10376.00s]  I'm gonna count it down and we're gonna definitely just slam right into this wall. Okay, this one's a no-winder
[10376.52s -> 10380.24s]  No, we can't there's no way to no-win. Okay, okay
[10380.80s -> 10385.03s]  This has to be wind. I'm sorry. I had that wrong. Um
[10387.06s -> 10398.18s]  Uh-huh. Can you let go? No
[10399.10s -> 10408.50s]  No, it wasn't actually holding it. Oh, what this weird, right? By the way, dude, I'm uh, I'm I'm
[10410.34s -> 10412.34s]  I'm sorry that I got that wrong
[10412.99s -> 10418.96s]  I'm sorry. I had it wrong. It's so fucking hard to do that
[10419.52s -> 10421.52s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[10421.76s -> 10439.32s]  Like you I can't apologize. I can't do it. Okay, let's go now. I know this is so itchy dude. I'm sorry
[10440.76s -> 10444.72s]  How did you get to across your room in one second that was weird
[10447.70s -> 10456.53s]  Pull me up so we can fly up there
[10461.70s -> 10463.14s]  What do you mean?
[10463.14s -> 10482.16s]  Well, you're supposed to be pressing the fly up there button. Okay. Good. Good. Good
[10483.04s -> 10484.64s]  Alright, this is it
[10484.64s -> 10486.64s]  the final 50 meters
[10490.84s -> 10494.68s]  I dare you to read this look another pair of penguins. These guys have to have it
[10497.17s -> 10499.09s]  Hey, good day guys
[10499.09s -> 10503.49s]  Have you brought it? We well, we got all the way here and realized we didn't bring it
[10505.54s -> 10507.54s]  We would have come home as victorious
[10508.18s -> 10509.22s]  heroes
[10509.22s -> 10510.42s]  But no
[10510.42s -> 10512.50s]  They've had to leave the most important thing at home
[10513.75s -> 10515.75s]  Are you going to remind me for the rest of our lives?
[10516.39s -> 10519.83s]  Yes, I will maybe then you won't forget everything. Do you even remember my name?
[10520.87s -> 10526.98s]  So I don't want to read this anymore
[10526.98s -> 10527.94s]  wait
[10527.94s -> 10531.73s]  Come here
[10531.73s -> 10534.85s]  No, shut up. We really I wanted people mad that I skipped it. Shut up
[10536.60s -> 10538.60s]  Uh, it looked like a secret in there
[10538.68s -> 10542.52s]  I'm sorry for saying shut up. I didn't mean that
[10542.92s -> 10546.82s]  All right, this is it wait
[10547.65s -> 10550.40s]  Oh, you have okay you have one over there
[10553.89s -> 10555.43s]  three
[10555.43s -> 10556.82s]  No
[10556.82s -> 10560.10s]  All right. I gotta throw you I think
[10560.10s -> 10563.22s]  Yep, this is gonna be weird because how are we gonna do this from here?
[10565.20s -> 10571.25s]  Do what from here? Like you're gonna have to land and then we have to you have to land right on that snow part on the left
[10571.89s -> 10574.52s]  Otherwise, we're not gonna be able to do it
[10574.52s -> 10576.52s]  Just like that. Don't worry. I got it
[10577.08s -> 10578.44s]  On the left
[10578.44s -> 10581.48s]  If you landed on the ice, we would have not been able to do it
[10581.64s -> 10586.84s]  You're gonna throw it all the way to the ice. Yes, there is if you were unskilled like i'm not
[10591.35s -> 10594.07s]  The wind doesn't affect me up here. Yeah, but I don't want to get blown. Okay
[10596.32s -> 10598.56s]  Okay, this this might need like a little bit of a run
[10602.63s -> 10604.45s]  that's
[10604.45s -> 10606.13s]  You had it wrong
[10606.13s -> 10608.13s]  How did I have it wrong? We weren't gonna make that jump
[10608.69s -> 10615.99s]  See that I I should have done the timing on that one
[10616.87s -> 10618.87s]  You haven't done the time. What have you done?
[10619.59s -> 10625.27s]  What have I done? What have you done? You've actually done something very very bad. You've done something. You've done something incredibly bad
[10625.75s -> 10629.51s]  What have I done? I don't know what you did, but you've done something bad and now we have to do that
[10629.91s -> 10632.23s]  It's all right. It's gonna take us right there. What have you done?
[10632.95s -> 10638.82s]  What have I done? I don't know. What have you done? You did something bad. What have I done? What have I done? Okay
[10639.78s -> 10642.69s]  It's it's salvageable
[10642.69s -> 10644.69s]  I think it's salvageable. It's salvageable. We just gotta
[10645.88s -> 10649.08s]  Uh, he he is absolutely floundering right now. He's like falling off stuff
[10650.08s -> 10652.08s]  He's in shock. We have to we gotta we gotta
[10652.16s -> 10655.20s]  Jeremy I like games. Okay. Sorry. All right. We're good. No, it's fine. We're good
[10659.09s -> 10660.85s]  Running against the wind. We're okay
[10660.85s -> 10664.05s]  It's okay. It's all right. I'm
[10664.13s -> 10665.65s]  Jeremy what have I done?
[10665.65s -> 10672.44s]  It's everything's gonna be fine. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be all right
[10673.08s -> 10681.54s]  Just take a look. It's only four. We were at 450 440. This is not a problem
[10682.50s -> 10685.83s]  That's really not a problem. Don't go
[10688.26s -> 10690.18s]  We need to hit this perfect
[10690.18s -> 10692.98s]  As the as the wind ends, otherwise, we're gonna get caught again
[10693.78s -> 10710.47s]  So perfect win ending timing. Okay. Yeah, this is not a problem. We're fine. There's no wind here. I'm the anchor
[10711.11s -> 10717.14s]  I got you
[10717.14s -> 10730.52s]  Any wrongers win here or 432 we're already back
[10737.04s -> 10739.04s]  I'm gonna i'm not gonna blame you on that
[10740.15s -> 10741.27s]  again
[10741.27s -> 10744.39s]  How about you time one? Let's see. Let's see how good it goes. I don't even know what's
[10745.91s -> 10749.03s]  I don't even know what the button is. It was like four on the numpad. I don't know what it is
[10749.11s -> 10752.09s]  That's how hard it is. You don't even know the button and i'm getting critiques
[10754.84s -> 10756.84s]  Why would both of us do it?
[10757.16s -> 10759.88s]  One of us has to take the charge on it. Are you gonna swing?
[10762.66s -> 10764.66s]  I am so
[10765.30s -> 10771.22s]  Like what but it's like what does he mean? Okay, but if we get to 500 from here
[10771.78s -> 10776.50s]  That's we that's the end of the game. We beat it and yeah, we cheated along the way, but who cares
[10777.38s -> 10781.41s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. This is this is perfect
[10783.94s -> 10786.34s]  Dude, I I tried so hard
[10796.80s -> 10808.74s]  We did it again, we're gonna be we're gonna handle this three two one go
[10809.70s -> 10810.66s]  Uh
[10810.66s -> 10813.52s]  You're rushing a little
[10813.52s -> 10818.32s]  Because I know we have the potential to succeed you're rushing just a little okay
[10818.88s -> 10822.16s]  No wind ice wait for wind next jump
[10827.46s -> 10829.46s]  I said wait. I said wait
[10829.70s -> 10835.73s]  I said wait, I said wait, but didn't you say no wind jump then wait? Uh, you did say wait for wind
[10837.32s -> 10838.60s]  because if
[10838.60s -> 10840.77s]  Because if the wind's going
[10853.67s -> 10859.11s]  We're just not meant for each other I admit it we needed to just wait a little longer
[10863.04s -> 10865.04s]  Just don't put one of those
[10865.04s -> 10871.14s]  Checkpoints down here. You call the shots man. Okay, you ready?
[10871.86s -> 10875.49s]  Yeah
[10875.49s -> 10879.09s]  I didn't you didn't hear anything and are we waiting after the next one?
[10879.89s -> 10883.78s]  Here's what we're gonna do ready
[10883.78s -> 10885.78s]  Get up and no no no
[10887.62s -> 10889.35s]  Go
[10889.35s -> 10892.47s]  What's you know? No, I just I don't know what the button is
[10900.60s -> 10902.68s]  Okay, there we go put one of those things down
[10905.22s -> 10909.54s]  Uh, you can't can't well, we'll just wait down here
[10916.37s -> 10918.58s]  There we go
[10918.58s -> 10923.04s]  Oh fuck we might be able to get this uh thing
[10937.24s -> 10941.56s]  Nice oh my baby boy with his little goatee and his rock friend
[10942.61s -> 10945.89s]  Jeff is going to be my partner for the journey. That's the single player
[10946.61s -> 10950.07s]  Oh cool
[10950.07s -> 10953.43s]  All right. Here we are. It didn't we're fine. Everything's good. Put one of those down
[10954.93s -> 10957.73s]  Mine was the real one 50 meters and we're good
[10968.45s -> 10982.42s]  Now i'm gonna throw you just call the taxi
[10983.30s -> 11001.96s]  And call a taxi
[11001.96s -> 11003.00s]  Okay
[11003.00s -> 11005.49s]  And go
[11007.14s -> 11017.09s]  Help me up. Okay. There's nothing here. There's no wind here. We're good
[11019.00s -> 11027.19s]  Good idea that one's hard to time
[11027.67s -> 11029.67s]  We're gonna go a lot earlier
[11030.79s -> 11035.73s]  Yeah, i'm saying like we go like now
[11036.61s -> 11040.64s]  Yep, it's it's too hard to time with the counter
[11041.60s -> 11052.50s]  Yeah, I think it's very obvious one to go. I think we should do it. Let's go for it. Okay when it comes up
[11055.48s -> 11061.14s]  Okay, uh ready yes, that's perfect
[11067.94s -> 11069.22s]  Holy shit
[11069.22s -> 11072.15s]  Just go
[11072.15s -> 11074.15s]  One of those. Oh, no
[11074.31s -> 11079.43s]  Can you get me? Yeah
[11079.76s -> 11085.84s]  Okay. So so what what what what what what what what are we what are we now? No
[11086.64s -> 11089.68s]  No, what are we doing after we get on that? Okay, we're going
[11090.96s -> 11094.40s]  And then we're going to jump to that little block immediately. Yeah, and I
[11095.04s -> 11098.16s]  You have I have to grab and then we'll okay. I think we have to throw from there
[11100.39s -> 11102.79s]  That was that was just not it was the time timing was wrong
[11103.43s -> 11105.73s]  Yeah, but we still had to go
[11105.73s -> 11107.89s]  We still had to we literally had to
[11108.61s -> 11125.33s]  We're good. Whoa, the wind the wind. Oh the wind bro
[11126.13s -> 11127.81s]  the wind
[11127.81s -> 11135.40s]  Okay, hold on
[11135.40s -> 11139.11s]  Because we need a no wind situation
[11139.67s -> 11142.80s]  We do need no wind
[11142.80s -> 11145.30s]  Okay, this one
[11146.18s -> 11148.18s]  Sit no, we can't oh
[11148.66s -> 11153.38s]  Okay, the no wind and then we immediately go up to the next one. All right. No wind immediate next one
[11153.54s -> 11155.54s]  Are you grabbing or am I this one? Are you grabbing?
[11156.68s -> 11159.64s]  I'm grabbing whoever can grab can grab. All right, then I need to
[11160.28s -> 11161.72s]  Let you go
[11161.72s -> 11163.72s]  When let go on this one? No
[11164.68s -> 11168.36s]  That was just that was it's hard to do that. Wow that and I I didn't want you to
[11169.68s -> 11171.20s]  run out of breath
[11171.20s -> 11173.84s]  Holding that's actually tricky. That one's very hard
[11178.63s -> 11180.47s]  Okay, we need to wait
[11180.47s -> 11184.80s]  Are you grabbing or am I grabbing you're grabbing go?
[11187.70s -> 11190.90s]  Again, again, we have to go immediately because when the wind comes back from them
[11191.46s -> 11194.82s]  Yeah, yeah, we have to go. We have to go honey. We have to go. I feel you
[11198.58s -> 11201.86s]  Not this time because when the next time and we have to immediately go to block
[11202.82s -> 11205.12s]  And then I'm grabbing
[11205.44s -> 11207.28s]  Yes
[11207.28s -> 11210.48s]  Okay, ready one. I have to wait for the wind to end. Yep
[11213.57s -> 11215.41s]  Okay this time
[11215.41s -> 11216.37s]  nice
[11216.37s -> 11219.17s]  And then where am I going from here? All the way left, I guess
[11219.89s -> 11224.69s]  How the fuck are you gonna do that hit it? You're hitting the weirdest swings
[11225.41s -> 11228.68s]  We need wind you have to let me go
[11229.60s -> 11231.76s]  I know but your swings were such shit
[11232.95s -> 11234.79s]  censor yourself
[11234.79s -> 11237.19s]  Your swings were such bad swings
[11237.83s -> 11242.69s]  Are you gonna say say shoot?
[11242.93s -> 11244.21s]  instead of that
[11244.21s -> 11245.17s]  word
[11245.17s -> 11248.31s]  What the okay anybody watching?
[11249.67s -> 11252.76s]  This is tough
[11252.76s -> 11255.08s]  Are you looking for full revolutions when I get on there?
[11256.21s -> 11259.00s]  Don't go
[11259.00s -> 11261.24s]  Uh, I mean, yeah, that would help a lot
[11261.72s -> 11265.46s]  Okay, because you you were going like upright and then not swinging down
[11265.46s -> 11270.50s]  You're like dropping down and ganking on the roof. Keep in mind. That is the fourth time i've ever done that
[11271.06s -> 11277.99s]  Bro, you accepted your smurf diagnosis. What?
[11289.04s -> 11290.24s]  wait
[11290.24s -> 11294.36s]  This next one immediately jump on immediately grab the block
[11303.84s -> 11307.83s]  Nope
[11308.79s -> 11314.07s]  I think it would that one isn't something that breaks. So maybe I should just land on it and drop a flag
[11314.95s -> 11319.16s]  Not a bad idea
[11319.16s -> 11323.25s]  Landing on it's hard though
[11323.25s -> 11325.25s]  This one we're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it
[11327.62s -> 11329.94s]  All right, you let me you want me to let you go on the top?
[11330.74s -> 11332.23s]  Let go
[11332.23s -> 11334.53s]  You wanna get above it?
[11334.53s -> 11335.65s]  Okay, nice
[11335.65s -> 11340.95s]  Can you just pull me up now? Yeah, there's no wind up here, right? Oh, there is there is
[11341.51s -> 11343.51s]  All right. Now, what the hell are we doing?
[11344.10s -> 11347.43s]  Are we just running and jumping or are you swinging?
[11347.83s -> 11350.47s]  I think i'm swinging. Can you swing from down here though?
[11351.70s -> 11353.38s]  That's that might be too thick
[11353.38s -> 11358.98s]  What do you mean? I mean if I throw you isn't that is it too thick? No, it's all right
[11359.62s -> 11367.81s]  Needed a little more oomph
[11367.81s -> 11369.81s]  Imagine this without flags. Yeah, I know
[11370.53s -> 11371.81s]  It'd be horrible
[11371.81s -> 11383.96s]  Okay, here we go. This is tricky because there's not a whole lot of room for me to run
[11385.81s -> 11387.81s]  We'll get it. We'll get it eventually
[11388.29s -> 11394.88s]  I do have to go kind of up
[11395.49s -> 11397.65s]  But I don't know you're you're the master
[11398.76s -> 11400.28s]  on the swinger
[11401.62s -> 11405.62s]  There it is. Oh shit. Nice drop a flag there when you get a chance
[11406.34s -> 11416.50s]  beautiful
[11416.50s -> 11417.78s]  I
[11417.78s -> 11419.78s]  Wasn't sure if it was gonna stop or not
[11425.04s -> 11427.84s]  You hit the bottom of it. Yeah, I mean I hit the bottom of it
[11428.64s -> 11430.64s]  I'm just saying in general
[11430.64s -> 11432.64s]  You you did that?
[11432.80s -> 11437.97s]  Uh, we have to I think we have to run left and then right I think it's like a run left run right
[11438.53s -> 11441.76s]  See it again
[11441.76s -> 11445.44s]  I don't think you need to oh, oh shit. We have the camera there
[11445.84s -> 11447.84s]  Oh, that's fucked up
[11447.92s -> 11451.28s]  That's you get that far with no checkpoints. You're like, oh, let's just oh wait. No, you can
[11452.08s -> 11453.12s]  um
[11453.12s -> 11456.39s]  I don't think i'm a sentient human anymore
[11456.63s -> 11461.84s]  We only got like 30 meters to go. How are we doing this? What are we doing?
[11462.72s -> 11465.30s]  I don't know, but we're gonna do it
[11465.30s -> 11466.74s]  It doesn't make any sense
[11466.74s -> 11480.76s]  What do you do? I like throw you
[11482.60s -> 11484.12s]  What do you do here?
[11484.12s -> 11489.24s]  I think we need to time a second jump to get on top of that ice jump up on the ice. Yeah
[11490.04s -> 11499.17s]  Hold on. Okay, we're gonna die. Yeah, and then the other one as soon as it gets to the top top
[11499.33s -> 11504.77s]  We gotta jump up
[11504.77s -> 11506.85s]  You you know, you know exactly what we're doing
[11512.13s -> 11516.29s]  There it is. Oh shit, we gotta and we have to keep moving. Oh, that is gonna be hell on earth
[11516.77s -> 11520.21s]  We have to keep flying over it. Keep doing the neck. Do the next jump. Yep
[11520.53s -> 11522.77s]  We just have to do just imagine you're playing this by yourself
[11523.41s -> 11541.75s]  That's a good attempt. All right, play the game by yourself
[11544.82s -> 11545.54s]  Oh
[11545.54s -> 11548.02s]  Okay. No, I was I had I had a misunderstanding
[11548.50s -> 11553.78s]  Misinterpretation we're gonna go up on ice up on ice over to the right when it gets the right elevator
[11561.44s -> 11564.28s]  Sorry good
[11564.28s -> 11565.40s]  Oh
[11565.40s -> 11568.20s]  Yeah, put flag down. Let's go
[11570.96s -> 11572.96s]  We're gonna jump you grab the
[11573.44s -> 11576.47s]  right
[11576.47s -> 11578.23s]  Oops a daisy
[11578.23s -> 11581.83s]  Do I think you misunderstood what we're doing? I kind of did for a second, but we're good
[11583.25s -> 11585.25s]  See the block what are you guys doing?
[11587.03s -> 11592.47s]  If we get to a new zone, i'm done by the way if it's a new zone and there's like more I can't I cannot
[11593.11s -> 11606.15s]  All right ready
[11606.15s -> 11608.07s]  Okay, let go
[11608.07s -> 11613.48s]  There it is
[11613.48s -> 11614.60s]  Flag down
[11614.60s -> 11621.00s]  Okay, we gotta wait after the wind ends and time this omega
[11621.70s -> 11624.19s]  perfectly
[11626.58s -> 11632.26s]  This I don't think we can count this down what's with the spam stop spamming what are you guys doing? Stop stop
[11634.79s -> 11640.37s]  Go wait
[11640.37s -> 11641.73s]  the moon

[11645.52s -> 11648.02s]  All right
[11648.02s -> 11650.18s]  There's one I think I gotta swing you
[11652.10s -> 11663.68s]  And this might be it
[11663.68s -> 11665.68s]  We did it the peak
[11667.70s -> 11670.02s]  The peak we did it. Did we actually do it? That's me
[11672.76s -> 11675.16s]  Did it we finally did it
[11675.16s -> 11677.00s]  Give me the rock. Oh with the we have take the rock with us
[11682.10s -> 11683.94s]  Kind of slow with the rock
[11683.94s -> 11688.93s]  We need it though. Do I need it? It's for the achievement. How do you pick it up?
[11694.32s -> 11697.68s]  I can't it's got it. It's got to be tied to you. Oh, well
[11698.88s -> 11708.66s]  We're leaving them. You just want to leave them. Yeah, we actually did it. That's the end. We did it. Nice job
[11715.22s -> 11717.14s]  Mail in the letter to santa
[11717.14s -> 11718.50s]  No
[11718.50s -> 11728.07s]  Oh

[11740.26s -> 11743.06s]  And you know, very cool. That's fine. You had fun
[11743.86s -> 11750.82s]  I did I'm glad that we beat it. I'm glad that we pulled through and we got to experience this wondrous journey
[11751.76s -> 11755.35s]  Together that was a good time
[11756.96s -> 11761.32s]  Look, that's us. That's me and that's you and i'm in the front. Yep. I'm in the back

[11774.28s -> 11779.57s]  Yeah
[11779.57s -> 11782.37s]  Is there a post credits funny thing that we have to do or what?
[11783.01s -> 11788.40s]  My hair has been like glued to my head over here this whole time
[11789.20s -> 11791.20s]  Uh, now I know what people were talking about
[11791.76s -> 11816.47s]  Look at how long this is getting
[11816.47s -> 11819.27s]  Hillary clinton. No, this is this is more lord
[11828.36s -> 11837.86s]  All right. All right. Now we have to do it again, but a little bit faster. Okay

[12172.47s -> 12175.96s]  Technically going to work. I think it's great
[12175.96s -> 12177.64s]  I think I got a pretty good balance too
[12177.64s -> 12183.04s]  And like I said previously sometimes you might not see a stream for a little bit
[12184.02s -> 12205.16s]  But I don't think it's gonna be too crazy, but I like it if you enjoyed it's good. Yeah, I do
[12208.53s -> 12210.53s]  Still trying to get that healthy balance
[12215.96s -> 12218.32s]  any projects to look out for
[12218.32s -> 12220.40s]  uh, there is at least a few that
[12222.00s -> 12226.16s]  I've been on but obviously I don't want to tell you what they are because
[12227.22s -> 12236.98s]  They're in development then you'll have to wait till they get announced, but they seem pretty awesome
[12239.27s -> 12240.71s]  You have a job
[12240.71s -> 12243.46s]  I do have a real job mom
[12247.59s -> 12258.20s]  Spoil everything and get fired. What a terrible use of my time. That would be that would be so stupid
[12266.42s -> 12268.42s]  All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Take it easy
[12268.90s -> 12287.25s]  Goodbye. Take care
