[41.72s -> 50.34s]  Hi guys. Uh, today, there's not supposed to be a stream here, there's just not. Uh, I
[50.34s -> 59.12s]  have a little bit of an apology for you today. Ass hair. I haven't- okay, I get- listen,
[59.12s -> 65.58s]  the microphone's down here right now. Listen to me. I haven't washed my hair in two days.
[65.58s -> 71.82s]  I've conditioned it twice. I haven't done that because after VR, my hair gets wicked
[71.82s -> 76.22s]  fucked up and I'm afraid to wash it because I'm afraid it'll fall out. So I haven't washed
[76.26s -> 83.01s]  my hair in two days. I'm gonna do it today. Alright, so you're probably asking, why am
[83.01s -> 88.58s]  I doing this? When I very, very clearly said that I was streaming on Thursday, well I fucked
[88.58s -> 94.49s]  up the sus. The sus said there was a stream today for the last two days. And I didn't
[94.49s -> 101.57s]  even know there was a stream that was scheduled for today until, uh, like half an hour ago?
[101.57s -> 106.05s]  Forty minutes ago? So, come on. What's this? Get up there like that. There you go. Now
[106.05s -> 109.71s]  you look better. I didn't know there was gonna be a stream today, but now apparently there
[109.71s -> 116.62s]  is. I told you guys, anybody that was in the bank pre-stream chat that we were gonna
[116.62s -> 124.77s]  do an auto stream, sleeping right there. Uh, this is literally gonna be like thirty minutes.
[124.77s -> 128.53s]  I'm just doing this because I got guilt tripped by pre-stream because I- you know, I- this
[128.53s -> 132.81s]  is a guilt trip stream. You got me. Chat, I'm not gonna turn the stream on. I'm not gonna
[132.81s -> 135.97s]  do it. I'm only gonna stream for like thirty minutes. Alright, maybe I'll do- yeah, that's
[135.97s -> 139.61s]  fine. I'll do one stream for thirty minutes. Okay, well, uh, two hours. No, chat, I'm not
[139.61s -> 144.24s]  gonna do two hours. Okay, I'll do three hours. Chat, I'm not gonna do four hours. How about
[144.24s -> 153.06s]  like a twenty-four hour stream? Is it okay? No, no, I won't do that. Didn't I actually
[153.06s -> 161.65s]  say two days ago that I wasn't going to cave to things people said? I said this two days
[161.65s -> 166.05s]  ago. I said I am- when I say goes, and then literally I'm turning on a stream on a day
[166.05s -> 175.19s]  that I'm not supposed to be streaming. I don't know. Whatever. Alright, anyways, let's break
[175.19s -> 180.70s]  this down. I have never done a stream where auto just hung out right here. And the camera's
[180.70s -> 189.36s]  never been pointed down here. You've never got a full body shot of auto for a long time.
[189.44s -> 202.76s]  Let's see what happens. Ready? Watch this. Auto. Auto. Over there. Who's sleeping over
[202.76s -> 220.88s]  there? Auto. Come over here. Come- come- right- go there, exactly. Oh, here comes a full
[220.88s -> 229.57s]  body reveal of the dog. Oh, no, never mind. This is the only fucking time you're ever
[229.57s -> 234.43s]  gonna get this, by the way. I'm never doing this ever again. I'm only doing this because
[234.43s -> 246.68s]  people bullied me. Let's just get off and leave. Go the dog? I have his favorite toys
[246.68s -> 257.44s]  out there. He doesn't even know they're out there. Bullying works. No, it doesn't. I did
[257.44s -> 266.12s]  this because I felt like it. Hey, come over here. You know, I set this up so you'd be
[266.12s -> 279.74s]  seen. You're not even being seen right now. Come over here. Hey, lazy dog, go over there.
[279.74s -> 290.82s]  Right here. Go. Come here. Come on. I know what it'll make you get up. Watch, he's gonna-
[291.82s -> 307.02s]  Toy. He'll move for his favorite toy. Just you wait. Flamingo. See? Oh, dude, auto reveal.
[307.02s -> 324.66s]  Is this what you want? Yeah? I have Mr. Flamingo. There he is. Finally, I reveal my dog after
[324.66s -> 334.30s]  12 years. He loves this thing. He's ripped the stuffing out of this thing like 10 times.
[334.30s -> 340.61s]  He's a little chunky. He actually has lost some weight, believe it or not. He's lost
[340.61s -> 349.70s]  like five pounds. He was like 27 pounds. He was huge. Now he's 24 pounds, which is still,
[349.70s -> 358.58s]  he needs to lose a little bit more weight, but it's okay. Auto is perfect. No, he's not.
[358.58s -> 368.26s]  Remember, he's a Dachshund mix. He's not a Dachshund. He's a Dachshund rat terrier, Shetland
[368.26s -> 375.12s]  Sheepdog Chihuahua. It's been confirmed. That's been completely confirmed. I didn't get to like
[375.12s -> 381.07s]  get the fuck out of the way. What if he's just like shit on the carpet right now? Don't, hey,
[381.07s -> 388.70s]  don't do anything. Get daddy in trouble. He just like spins around and just like dumps right here.
[389.26s -> 433.73s]  Oh, people are giving me money. Get out. Get out. All right. What the fuck? Leave? He's not dead.
[433.73s -> 452.38s]  He does. Hey, want this? You want this? You want this? You want this? Get this. Get this. Get this.
[454.10s -> 462.11s]  Get it. Oh, he got it. He got it. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.
[462.11s -> 475.14s]  Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Take it. Get it. Does he know any tricks? Um, some. All right.
[475.14s -> 481.52s]  Yeah, let's, let's, we'll have Otto do some tricks. By the way, he's one of those dogs that he knows
[481.52s -> 486.74s]  like three tricks and he does them all instantly if you have a treat in your hand. You already
[486.74s -> 492.26s]  watched this. He knows, he knows paw, he knows sit, he knows lay down, he knows roll over. So,
[492.26s -> 496.66s]  if you have a treat in your hand, he goes like this. It flips over on his back as fast as he can.
[498.22s -> 505.97s]  Hey, let's show, let's show the people what you can do, Otto. All right, I'm going to leave him
[505.97s -> 511.66s]  here. Is this going to be like a toy story scenario where like I leave the room, he doesn't
[511.66s -> 515.34s]  know that this is recording and he gets up and starts walking on fucking two legs.
[564.11s -> 570.66s]  I just fell up the stairs twice. I went out and fell and then hit my shoulder on the wall
[570.66s -> 583.55s]  and fell again. He loves these fucking things. Hey, hey, hey, hey, chat. He doesn't know.
[584.03s -> 599.82s]  Okay. Itchy? Okay, you ready? Hey, what is this? Ready to do some tricks? Okay, lay down.
[600.62s -> 608.46s]  Paw? Paw? No, I didn't say roll over yet. Come back up. Come on. Okay, wait. Lay down. Lay down.
[608.46s -> 621.34s]  Roll over. Paw. Oh, he's so fucking smart. Only my boy. Sometimes he throws this too. Let me leave
[621.34s -> 639.86s]  the room. Sometimes he just picks it up and whips it. He'll pick it up and he'll just whip it into
[639.86s -> 662.14s]  the wall. What? Wait, what? What? What's going on? There's 13, there's 14,000 people here right now.
[662.14s -> 675.33s]  What are you talking? No, there's not. It was a raid? Oh, no. A raid? Who raided? It's supposed
[675.33s -> 681.39s]  to be like a... Oh, shit. Hold on a minute. Oh, no. I gotta get the dog. I'm blocking the view of the
[681.39s -> 690.80s]  dog. Hey, you that just joined the stream, welcome. Today's a subscriber... What day is it? Tuesday.
[690.80s -> 697.44s]  Today's... Welcome to Subscriber Wednesday, where I do a quick little for the subs. I do a quick
[697.44s -> 707.74s]  little 40 minute stream with my dog. Welcome to Sub Wednesday. What was it? Was it Kitboga?
[713.22s -> 719.06s]  Thanks a lot. Thanks, Kit. Hope you had a good stream today. This is a dog stream. It's a bonus
[719.06s -> 730.21s]  stream. That's so many people. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome. I'm Jerma. This is my dog, Otto.
[730.21s -> 736.22s]  You don't know who that is. We're just playing around for a few minutes. This is a guilt trip
[736.22s -> 748.26s]  stream. This is better than the robot carnival. It is not at all. Close. I eat bugs thanks to the
[748.26s -> 772.35s]  10 community subs. All right, now let's play a fun game called Chase Me. He's gonna get me. He's gonna
[772.35s -> 787.07s]  get me. I'm not the dog. This is not like dog. I'm not the dog. If you just got in here like a
[787.07s -> 798.34s]  minute ago. Let's start putting this in my mouth and start rolling around. I think he's done. I
[798.34s -> 816.54s]  think he's over it. Hey, I think he's over it. Where'd he go? Hey, Otto. Hey, what are you doing?
[819.79s -> 828.80s]  He's done. He doesn't even like want to come in here. Oh, you thought you could be really sneaky
[828.80s -> 837.36s]  and sneak in here and try to get this toy. All right. Is this weird if I put this in my mouth?
[838.88s -> 848.56s]  Is that weird? Why are you so itchy? What's going on here? What are you itchy? You got an itch?
[849.28s -> 867.42s]  What's with the itch? You didn't catch it. I haven't pet him yet. Oh, right. Sometimes we do this
[868.06s -> 884.90s]  and he'll just sit here all day and just stare at my face. Hey, time to be asleep.
[884.90s -> 927.22s]  What is it? What is it? Full sleeping dog stream. Oh, I get it. Right now he smells
[927.22s -> 930.18s]  the treat that was in my hand earlier. And now he's like, where's the other one? You have another
[930.18s -> 937.41s]  one, don't you? Look. All right. See, I'm doing it. I'm doing the thing. Look, I'm doing the thing.
[939.09s -> 954.43s]  Look, Otto. Hey, are you a good dog? What is it? What are you going to show? Hey, show everybody.
[954.91s -> 966.02s]  Your penguin stripe. Show everybody the penguin stripe. I'm pogging. So I can't believe there's
[966.02s -> 996.83s]  10 fucking thousand people here. I'm about to leave. Wait, hold on. Oh, he's talking shit,
[996.83s -> 1017.26s]  Otto. What are you going to do? He loves this thing too. This thing has been beat up so many
[1017.26s -> 1036.94s]  times. It's unbelievable. Look at it. Otto, kill. Oh, he kind of just, he's just kind of curious.
[1036.94s -> 1047.23s]  He's like, what are we doing? Go over the schedule for this week. If I could get in the way for a
[1047.23s -> 1057.97s]  second here. Sorry about that. Go over the schedule. What are you doing? What are you looking at?
[1058.61s -> 1064.16s]  All right. So let's get, look, I'll tell you the schedule from down here.
[1066.26s -> 1072.35s]  So the schedule, so the schedule this week is, oh, I'm going to fall down. I'm going to have to go
[1072.35s -> 1084.61s]  pee. Uh, he's been outside like an hour ago. Uh, anyways, we'll play Watch Dogs Legion tomorrow
[1084.61s -> 1090.03s]  at launch. And then after that, we're going to play Little Hope with Italics on Friday.
[1090.59s -> 1097.41s]  And then after that, we're going to go back and VR on Halloween night. It should be fun. Big bits.
[1098.13s -> 1108.62s]  I don't even, I can't even see them. I don't see anything. What were they? I don't see them.
[1109.18s -> 1120.34s]  Big bits, huge bits. Where are they? Move. I, I'm moving. Hold on. I want to track down these bits.
[1121.06s -> 1140.02s]  I don't see anything. Is this a debate? I see. Oh, look at all these followers. The new, oh,
[1140.10s -> 1147.62s]  there we go. I see. All right. Captain Nemo give 50 bucks. Thank you, Captain Nemo for the
[1147.62s -> 1155.42s]  $50. Probably said something. So hold on. It doesn't say the actual message, but what is it?
[1155.42s -> 1162.34s]  What are you doing? Having a good time? Are you having a good time? Face the floppy ears.
[1164.27s -> 1173.73s]  Dog flip. All right. I'm, I'm out of the way. More people are here at the auto stream than were at
[1173.81s -> 1182.83s]  like my last VR stream. That's so funny. A show werelord. Okay. He actually loves werelord. He
[1182.83s -> 1219.79s]  lies on top of it. If I bring it up here, you might line it. You want to know how I can prove
[1219.79s -> 1227.82s]  that this is a dog bed? Look at werelord. Look at this perfect dog sized crevice right here.
[1229.94s -> 1240.02s]  He's been permanently squished. You look at yardie. He's like, excuse me. That's my bed. Yeah.
[1240.98s -> 1254.78s]  What about it? What about it? What about it? Just sit on it. I feel like I'm trying to get an AI
[1254.78s -> 1262.05s]  in a video game to do something. Why are you so itchy today? What's going on? You're never this
[1262.05s -> 1275.01s]  itchy. Is he anxious? Are you anxious for being on TV? Oh, big eye crusty. That was a big one.
[1275.01s -> 1282.78s]  Did you see that? Eight actor. I feel like I'm like setting up like a, I was going to say a hitman
[1282.78s -> 1286.94s]  level, but I don't, that's not what we're doing. Well like, oh, I'm trying to get the AI to like
[1286.94s -> 1305.34s]  walk through a certain door. All right. Okay. I'm going to leave the room. Right. That was a burp.
[1306.06s -> 1316.70s]  It was like burped at me and then you had to burp and that's why.
[1323.92s -> 1328.48s]  Oh, this has been a 20, what'd I say? 45 minutes. How long has it been? 20.
[1328.48s -> 1341.86s]  Teach your dog, teach your dog vape tricks. We're halfway there. What else do you do?
[1341.94s -> 1356.53s]  It's been 25 minutes. You promised 45 minutes. Uh, all right. Yeah. So hold him. He doesn't want
[1356.53s -> 1369.78s]  to be held right now. Right? Such a good dog. Every time this dog goes to the vet, the vet
[1369.78s -> 1376.74s]  always talks about how everybody loves him. He's the sweetest dog ever to ever come into our
[1376.74s -> 1380.82s]  practice. And I know they say that to every single customer, even if your dog like pissed on the
[1380.82s -> 1384.02s]  ground and like jumped on top of the counter and like fucking knocked a bunch of shit off the,
[1384.02s -> 1389.57s]  I know, I know. And he said this to everybody. He really is. He really is like the sweetest boy
[1389.57s -> 1406.34s]  ever. Tell us a story about him. Hold on. Let me move. Hold on. I, look, it's, it's my stream
[1406.34s -> 1413.15s]  right now. Okay. He's an actor. He's a guest on my stream today. About me. It's about me, baby.
[1413.15s -> 1434.40s]  Cause it's not, I can't see him. Even he's like, what the fuck are you doing? Tell us a story,
[1434.40s -> 1453.07s]  a story about Otto. Okay. Oh, you're irrelevant. It's crazy. This is actually the first time ever
[1453.07s -> 1459.06s]  that I've done this. I guess I've always seen Otto, like me holding him like this. And I go,
[1459.06s -> 1464.42s]  Oh, look, look at the camera. It's never just been like a, an auto cam for more than five seconds.
[1464.98s -> 1476.75s]  Sometimes in bed, he'll just roll over like this and stay that way until, until you touch his
[1476.75s -> 1482.67s]  stomach. He'll do it for an hour. He'll just be like, um, excuse me. You haven't fucking done it
[1482.67s -> 1488.35s]  yet in like 30 minutes. And then finally you'll do it. And then he's like, Oh, okay. Thank you.
[1489.07s -> 1495.42s]  And then he'll put his arm down, scratch the dog's belly, pet the dog.
[1505.41s -> 1517.52s]  What he's dedicated. Yeah. Nothing makes us happier than seeing this kiss. Otto,
[1518.24s -> 1536.98s]  Otto, can I kiss? Like, uh, you haven't, excuse me. Okay. See. Okay. Getting rejected.
[1537.70s -> 1546.18s]  Am I getting rejected? I, I'm going to take you back. Hey, uh, guys, don't you think
[1546.18s -> 1552.26s]  this looks like a really comfy bed? Oh, I would really love to lie on this bed because it's mine.
[1552.98s -> 1559.02s]  I'm going to go ahead and put this right here. Ooh. Oh, that's, that's comfy. Oh, this is a
[1559.02s -> 1568.56s]  comfortable bed. Don't you think Otto? Usually he gets up and he'll be like, excuse me. What the
[1568.56s -> 1578.69s]  fuck? I feel like I'm about to tell you guys a bunch of stuff about how my day went today.
[1579.65s -> 1594.64s]  Yeah. Hi guys. Yeah. Today was rough. I'm on the phone with you right now. Yeah. Fucking
[1594.64s -> 1616.24s]  bullshit. What are you doing tomorrow? Yeah. Don't even tell me about it. Don't even. Okay. I was
[1616.24s -> 1631.49s]  about to turn and like put my feet up like this, but nope. Muted? I was muted? How? Bless you. I
[1631.49s -> 1641.20s]  sneezed? Oh, the limiter. I was saying like, yeah, today was a bad day today. I was just talking on
[1641.20s -> 1645.60s]  the phone. Muted. Yeah, it's because I'm too far away from the limiter. That's all right.
[1646.24s -> 1656.16s]  Irma, is your what? Watch the No More Heroes 3 trailer. I did that like, like a year ago. I saw
[1656.16s -> 1672.85s]  it live and I reacted hard. I was a fucking react Andy. I was. There's a new one. What? New what?

[1688.46s -> 1692.86s]  move. I'm not moving until you give me a link about the new trailer so I can react Andy.
[1692.86s -> 1707.23s]  There it is. That's it. No More Heroes 3, a triple threat of No More Heroes. Why does this only have
[1707.23s -> 1712.82s]  20,000 views? Wait, does this come out like this? Is this like right now? Dude, did I catch this
[1712.82s -> 1718.53s]  right now? All right, hold on. Let me see. I need to get this on the browser. I need my headphones.

[1758.59s -> 1762.30s]  Okay. Good.
[1772.08s -> 1772.48s]  Nice.
[1780.40s -> 1781.44s]  This looks pretty good.
[1781.44s -> 1787.68s]  No More Heroes 3. What was once a fight between assassins is now a battle to the death on the
[1787.68s -> 1799.68s]  galactic scale. Take on galaxy. Just destroy all those nasty aliens. Now, fight. Dude, I'm going to
[1799.68s -> 1806.78s]  play this at fucking launch. I'm going to play the fuck out of this at launch. Wait, that means it's
[1806.78s -> 1818.02s]  a release date. Probably bring it on. I'll give you a little kiss. Release date. No More Heroes.
[1818.02s -> 1824.26s]  You've got news. Does it have to be like now? The first No More Heroes is getting ported to
[1824.26s -> 1831.58s]  Nintendo Switch. Pretty cool. Heroes 2 desperate struggle is coming to the Switch too.
[1832.30s -> 1862.05s]  I kind of wish I could play it on there. Holy shit. Nice. Nevada. Make a plan to vote early
[1862.05s -> 1866.37s]  by the October 30th deadline. If you don't vote early, you can still vote on election day.
[1866.37s -> 1873.73s]  You can vote if you can. Go vote. I don't know what this is. I can't turn it off. There it is.
[1873.73s -> 1882.58s]  Oh, vote. It's your duty and it's your right. But not in Nevada unless you live there.
[1884.42s -> 1904.72s]  Otto's gone. He's right here. He's right here. I'm blocking him perfectly. Okay. Are you ready?
[1904.72s -> 1915.38s]  Wait. I'm going to snap my fingers and Otto is going to be disappeared from the room. One, two.
[1916.34s -> 1939.39s]  Wait. One, two. He's gone. I don't know. He just he just he fucked off. He doesn't want to do this
[1939.39s -> 1944.11s]  anymore. He just went over to his blanket. He's lying in the okay. See this beam of light.
