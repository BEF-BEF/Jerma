[0.63s -> 10.70s]  Good afternoon. What's up? We're playing a video game today. We're playing Scribblenauts today.
[13.56s -> 20.94s]  Yep, I know a ton of people just freaked out. This is some of your favorite- some of you guys'
[20.94s -> 29.77s]  favorite video game. I know that for a fact. You know, it's been- it's been plenty of people over
[29.77s -> 35.77s]  the- uh, probably the last few years that have said, dude, please, you would- Scribblenauts is so much
[35.77s -> 42.26s]  fun. You would love it. Play it. Do it. Play it, motherfucker. Play the fucking game I want you.
[42.26s -> 53.61s]  I'm like, all right, maybe. And today we're gonna play it. We had some- I'm very early, yes. I was
[53.61s -> 61.05s]  up early today. I just was like, you know, I'm- I'm ready. I'm ready to go. Let's go. I'm gonna start
[61.05s -> 68.82s]  like an hour or two from now, but I decided to pull it back. He was up at 5 a.m. Yeah. I was up- I
[68.82s -> 80.09s]  was up at 5 o'clock in the morning reading my favorite newspaper, Pre-Stream Chat. You guys know
[80.09s -> 87.75s]  that I use Pre-Stream Chat as my morning coffee routine? You guys are way funnier than Garfield,
[87.75s -> 96.02s]  and you're way more interesting than Dilbert. I was like, the crazy shit- you can't say half
[96.02s -> 119.14s]  the crazy shit you guys say. I'm like, a foxtrot? Garfield rules. I mean, I don't hate Garfield,
[119.94s -> 130.57s]  I just- Pre-Stream Chat is more interesting. Okay, would you rather watch Garfield eat a lasagna
[130.57s -> 136.65s]  or watch 400 people yell at each other over the game that we're going to play today? I just sit
[136.65s -> 154.47s]  here and I'm like, oh, this is gonna be good. Revolt. Revolt. Can you write the debt out?
[154.47s -> 162.57s]  And what do you- I don't know what you mean. It's our amusement. He's using us for his amusement.
[163.05s -> 174.89s]  But we're gonna play Scribblenauts. I actually- I played? I don't think I've ever played
[174.89s -> 181.03s]  Scribblenauts. I played the other one, the DS, like 10 years ago, 15 years ago.
[182.17s -> 187.51s]  There was one- what came out on DS? Drawn to Life. I think that's the one that I played.
[194.20s -> 201.24s]  But I guess you draw characters and they come to life in this game? I actually almost made the
[201.24s -> 206.44s]  title of this stream Drawing to Life, or like Drawing- Drawn to Life. I almost said that.
[207.00s -> 216.86s]  That's a different game. No, not Draw My Life.
[219.34s -> 234.09s]  I did one of those as Grandpa. Does that video still exist or did I delete it? I think it still
[234.09s -> 238.55s]  exists. I don't think I've deleted that one. It's still up? Yeah, I think it is still up.
[240.87s -> 254.70s]  PeacefulHaley, thanks for the five community subs. Thank you, Haley. Five subs. PogHaley.
[254.70s -> 263.90s]  PogHaley. Watch it, it's awful. Delete it on stream. Is it that bad? I don't remember it.
[264.46s -> 269.67s]  Now, we're playing Scribblenauts. This does not embarrass me from my old videos today.
[271.19s -> 279.43s]  Will you ever come to Brazil? Um, probably not. I've never left North America in my life.
[283.16s -> 287.80s]  I'm probably never gonna leave North America. Like, you know, I wanna go to Japan! Man,
[287.80s -> 292.04s]  I sure would love to go to Tokyo! Oh, England sounds so cool. I wanna go to Ireland!
[293.27s -> 302.97s]  No, I'm just too- I don't wanna go anywhere. Who doesn't wanna go to Japan or Tokyo? Really?
[304.78s -> 313.86s]  It's an incredibly interesting place. You don't need to like Japanese cartoons
[313.86s -> 321.78s]  to want to go to an incredibly, incredibly rich cultural, incredible historical area.
[322.34s -> 337.54s]  Shut up, you're a weeb. You know what? Just for that comment, just for that comment,
[337.54s -> 342.34s]  I'm watching One Punch Man Season 2 starting tonight. Just for that comment. For that comment
[342.34s -> 352.97s]  alone, I'm gonna start episode one tonight. And I know that it sucks. I know that it's way worse
[352.97s -> 360.57s]  than season one, but look what you did. Look what you've done. Everybody says,
[360.57s -> 365.83s]  oh, it's a new- it's a different animation studio. It sucks. Too bad. I'm gonna watch it now.
[368.63s -> 379.75s]  Sorry, Jeremy, you're going to Brazil. Wait, what? Uh, sorry. Sorry, dude, but you're going.
[383.64s -> 387.96s]  Why? That's like, that's like scary. All right, what you just said was scary. Okay,
[388.84s -> 400.63s]  I'm gonna play the game. No, it's time to do the- it's time to do the pre-live. No, what is it?
[400.63s -> 408.41s]  What would this be called? Hang- the hanging out before the cast. This is the pre-stream,
[408.97s -> 416.14s]  which again, I have to make this really clear. A lot of you guys- pre-stream is essentially
[416.22s -> 422.49s]  the Germa Congress. I saw that meme and it's real. How many people are- how many people are in
[422.49s -> 443.35s]  Congress? 200? 300? It's- it's 400- 400 something, right? Like 500? 435? Okay. There are like 410
[443.35s -> 450.49s]  people in pre-stream chat that decide a ton of things. So, I mean, if you want to be part of the
[450.49s -> 456.57s]  Germa Congress, you've got a lot of sway in that, like, you know, two, three, four hours before a
[456.57s -> 471.27s]  stream happens. Pre-stream chat ending waiting room. Pre-stream chat holds too much power.
[474.17s -> 482.12s]  Impeach this guy. Call the- call the house speaker. Who would the house speaker of pre-stream chat be?
[482.12s -> 488.54s]  Now, that's a whole can of worms I'm not gonna get into. You want to start a fight? That's how
[488.54s -> 506.78s]  you just started one. Do not. Let end stream chat decide. Something, for once. You know? Damn.
[507.93s -> 515.64s]  That is true. That is absolutely, positively accurate. And I'll tell you why. Pre-stream chat
[516.20s -> 521.32s]  is here and ready for the stream. And they're here sometimes two, three, four hours before I even
[521.32s -> 529.53s]  start. Right? Post-stream chat stuck around the whole time. And they- they were here to the end.
[531.43s -> 545.99s]  They were dedicated. Mm. That'd mean they deserved to be rewarded. Okay. Post-stream chat today.
[547.64s -> 553.34s]  Going to decide the next stream. There you go. Watch this. It's like the highest view count I've
[553.34s -> 564.07s]  ever had today. I'm staying. He's playing Sly Cooper tomorrow. Not streaming tomorrow. But, you
[564.07s -> 570.49s]  know. It's like 40,000 concurrent viewers here. Oh, yo. I'm gonna tell him he's gonna be- he's
[570.49s -> 585.85s]  gonna play Immortal Redneck. All right. Let's go. Is this capping or what? I've got nice music,
[585.85s -> 592.89s]  but where's the cap? Where's my capture? Dog Yelp just gave five community subs. Thank you,
[592.97s -> 601.75s]  Dog Yelp. Thanks a lot. You guys ready to get started? You guys ready to get started? Hey,
[601.75s -> 607.56s]  are you guys ready to get started? Immortal Redneck was a good stream. It was a really good game,
[607.56s -> 613.53s]  too. It was very good. It was really fun. There was like two that came out that- there was
[613.53s -> 618.76s]  Immortal Redneck and then there was um- what was the one that I played? City of something?
[620.62s -> 629.29s]  City of something. It's like City of Egypt or something. It was like the same game but
[629.29s -> 639.06s]  kind of different. City of Brass. Oh, that was it. Okay. Stop stalling. I'm not stalling.
[639.14s -> 656.41s]  What's about to start? Huge bits. Oh, that's a lot. That's a lot. I forgot to update my rules.
[656.41s -> 659.69s]  All right. We're gonna slowly pan this out, but this is somebody's birthday. Hold on. It's
[659.69s -> 667.64s]  somebody's birthday today. I have- it's somebody's little brother's birthday, okay? And excuse me,
[669.02s -> 673.50s]  it's somebody's birthday or little sibling. Sorry. I don't know why I said little brother.
[673.50s -> 681.94s]  Little sibling's birthday today. Hey, Crows. Q-Rows. Crows, happy birthday.
[684.20s -> 693.64s]  We're talking about your birthday, Crows. Have a good one. That's from Sparkly Pantsu. Sparkly
[693.64s -> 699.21s]  Pantsu. I'm gonna make that very, very, very quick. I need to also say happy birthday.
[699.77s -> 711.21s]  That's huge bits. That's an insane amount of money. I will reiterate again. I'm probably going to turn
[711.21s -> 722.41s]  bits off. That's too much money to give me, but thank you nonetheless and happy birthday to Crows.
[723.37s -> 731.48s]  Only don't- I didn't update my- the rules. I was- I forgot. I was gonna do that earlier this morning.
[731.48s -> 735.00s]  You're gonna ban your own income. No, I'm not banning my own income.
[735.72s -> 743.61s]  They say he really loves your streams and we often watch together. Well, happy birthday. Thank you.
[743.61s -> 752.65s]  Thank you so much. All right, everyone. I'm starting- Oh, it's a voice actor!
[752.65s -> 759.29s]  Grandpa Edgar and Grandma Julie. You might not believe this, but Grandpa Edgar used to be the
[759.29s -> 766.73s]  world's greatest adventurer. Grandma Julie would beg to differ. She was also an adventurer. Edgar
[766.73s -> 773.53s]  would often brush away vines or open doors thought to be undisturbed for generations, only to find
[773.53s -> 780.10s]  Julie was already there having lunch. They competed like this on adventure after adventure.
[780.98s -> 787.98s]  On one adventure, Julie beat Edgar to the top of a long lost pyramid.
[787.98s -> 792.70s]  I'm kidding, man. Relax. This is like the first kid's book. I haven't played part of the game.
[794.06s -> 801.96s]  The two of them semi-retired to start a family and they continued starting that family until they had
[801.96s -> 810.92s]  42 children. All right, settle down. One day, Mom and Dad gave Maxwell and me two amazing gifts.
[811.88s -> 814.12s]  And one day, they had a show on TLC.
[834.65s -> 838.01s]  It was a book that kills people. Death Note.
[838.09s -> 842.65s]  Little Bratz. So they sent us out to face the challenges of the outside world.
[843.90s -> 849.02s]  Life Note. On the road to the city, we ran into an old man who said he was hungry.
[851.27s -> 856.23s]  Maxwell made something to give him, but he played a nasty trick.
[857.91s -> 862.79s]  Apple was rotten. Oh, it really is Death Note. The old man spat it out as soon as he tasted it and was
[862.79s -> 869.67s]  very, very angry. As he cast some sort of magic, he called a spoiled little kid.
[870.15s -> 873.91s]  And then disappeared. It didn't seem like anything had happened.
[874.79s -> 878.95s]  But when Maxwell turned to continue down the road, I couldn't follow him.
[878.95s -> 884.79s]  The old man had put a curse on me that was turning me to stone. What? We didn't know what to do.
[884.79s -> 891.14s]  Luckily, our brother Edwin's farm was nearby. Boy, you should have seen how angry Edwin was.
[891.86s -> 896.74s]  He couldn't believe what we did to the old man and said we probably deserved what we got.
[896.74s -> 899.64s]  Aren't they like five?
[927.54s -> 928.74s]  Just write money in there.
[934.18s -> 940.66s]  Fuck up the whole economy. Just inflate all currency. Just write like five trillion dollars
[940.66s -> 955.78s]  in cash on there. Important question. Didn't you admit multiple times you're an awful
[955.78s -> 960.98s]  speller? This game requires spelling. Well, that's what I have you guys here for. Help me.
[961.78s -> 985.05s]  Why is my screen all messed up? Game crash? The game crash? How? I can't even close the game.
[989.03s -> 995.70s]  No, I did something. I can't close the game. I have to open up the task manager?
[998.54s -> 1007.21s]  Yes, Scribble 32 is not responding. Oh, okay. Well, let's open it back up.
[1007.21s -> 1015.88s]  This is Scribble Nots Unlimited, by the way. Those of you that think I'm playing on the
[1015.88s -> 1028.54s]  standard version for the Nintendo DS. Nope. Nope. Get a bunch of not safe for work mods.
[1030.38s -> 1041.40s]  You want me to take like a two week vacation from Twitch? Skip. Okay, here we go. This is fine.
[1043.13s -> 1056.65s]  There's Farmer Dan. Farmer Dan wants walk to the farmer. Okay. He's doing it. Okay. Hi. What can
[1056.65s -> 1062.66s]  I do for you? Click on Edwin. The basics. Earn a star right by helping Edwin with his award winning
[1062.66s -> 1074.54s]  pig. Okay. Turn the runt of the litter into an award winning pig. Write an object to help
[1074.54s -> 1103.29s]  Maxwell scrub the pig. Use the notepad. Type something to clean the pig. Uh, bathtub. Soap.
[1103.29s -> 1110.52s]  Oh, this is cool. Okay. Here, take it. Oh, I'm Maxwell. And then now use the object to clean
[1110.52s -> 1122.28s]  the pig. Clean the pig. Click the progress bar for the current hint. Click map. Remove this object.
[1123.00s -> 1132.15s]  Drag it to the trash can. The pig looks great. Now use an adjective to increase the pig's size.
[1133.45s -> 1146.62s]  Okay. An adjective. Type an adjective to increase the pig's size. Gargantuan. Got it. Help the pig
[1146.62s -> 1152.22s]  win the talent competition. Use an adjective and a noun to create wings. Large enough to carry the
[1152.22s -> 1165.22s]  pig. Uh, big wings. Okay. Hints are unlocked over time. And I need wings large enough to help me
[1165.22s -> 1179.67s]  fly. Oh, I have to use it. Oh, okay. Here we go. Create object. I need wings large. How about
[1180.31s -> 1188.22s]  big wings. The magic backpack stores objects for later. Throw the wings in the backpack and
[1188.22s -> 1202.38s]  wait for the judges to arrive. Big wings. Very uncreative. What is this tutorial? I don't know
[1202.38s -> 1211.03s]  how to play. Take the wings from the magic backpack and then put them on the pig and then watch
[1211.03s -> 1228.73s]  pigs fly. Is that Sims? What did I just do? The Sims, right? That's the movies, right? The movies.
[1228.73s -> 1240.17s]  You got it. He's about to crack him over the head. Oh, okay. We're good. Oh, I got a Starbright.
[1240.17s -> 1256.98s]  Completed the basics. Welcome to Scribblenauts. Okay. Earn shards by helping people. Ten shards
[1256.98s -> 1262.18s]  will form a Starbright. You Starbright vision to find shards. You guys can help me with that later.
[1262.18s -> 1269.43s]  I don't care. Golden objects for hints. Okay. So he needs something else. Help the sprout grow.
[1269.43s -> 1278.70s]  All right, let's go. Okay. Help the sprout grow. Water. No. Manure. How do you spell manure?
[1280.62s -> 1293.67s]  Manure. Oh my God. I was going to kill this guy. What happened? What happened? I did it. Okay. Put
[1293.67s -> 1301.16s]  that in your backpack. The plant scared away the other's shard opportunity. Reset the level to
[1301.16s -> 1315.75s]  return. I got the bad ending. So wait, that thing kills the town? I have to reset the level. What?
[1316.63s -> 1322.23s]  Hold on. What happened? Well, the notepad. What did I do? I failed it? Well, I typed in manure.
[1324.04s -> 1329.40s]  While the notepad can create many things of vulgarity, copyrighted material and proper
[1329.40s -> 1334.92s]  nouns are not allowed. So you're telling me I can't write like Captain America in there and he shows
[1334.92s -> 1345.19s]  up on the screen? Well, that's too bad. I can't write in like the mask from Goosebumps. Oh no.
[1346.07s -> 1351.85s]  You don't have every single word ever. What about this? Okay. I'm going to go for this. Okay. Create
[1351.85s -> 1366.18s]  object. Make the sprout grow. Write an object. Watering can. Done. Okay. Now. Use. Watering can.
[1366.82s -> 1378.57s]  Help the little girl. What do you need? My kitty is stuck on the top of the tree. Get it from me.
[1378.57s -> 1386.73s]  Okay. Put this in my backpack. Get rid of this. How do I take this off? Remove. I'm gonna put this
[1386.73s -> 1400.76s]  in my backpack. Okay. Ladder. Climb. What? Oh shit. Oh my god. Um. People are already writing
[1400.76s -> 1414.14s]  chainsaw. No. What the fuck is wrong with you guys? Wings. Airstrike. No. Ladder. See? Okay.
[1414.14s -> 1439.05s]  Now the cat can. Uh. Cat box. Did you mean? No. Litter box. Got it. I was trying to keep that.
[1440.46s -> 1444.70s]  Okay. Learning the basics was just the first step towards saving Lily. Use the bus stop to
[1444.70s -> 1453.40s]  begin your journey in Capital City. Oh yeah. They keep the litter. I don't know. I might need it.
[1453.40s -> 1461.27s]  Click Maxwell and select pick Avatar to play as any unlocked brother. Be sure you want to
[1461.27s -> 1472.76s]  enter the Avatar browser. I did it. Let's go to. Let's go to Capital City.
[1473.32s -> 1488.89s]  Everyone is low tier. How do you know that? Wait. Is that me? No. Get. Get away from me.
[1489.45s -> 1499.99s]  All right. Capital City bus stop. How is he bottom tier? Why is he bottom tier? What does
[1499.99s -> 1507.29s]  that mean? All right. Who needs help? I feel like I'm playing Pac-Man the New Adventures.
[1508.82s -> 1513.10s]  All right. What do you need? Do you need something? I want someone to entertain me.
[1513.10s -> 1531.62s]  All right. Clown makeup. All right. Create object. Clown. Hooray! What is going on?
[1532.78s -> 1538.94s]  Where do these people come from? All right. All right. That's enough. That's enough of the
[1538.94s -> 1545.34s]  clown. That's enough. You've paid for only five minutes. This car needs to be medicalized.
[1546.68s -> 1556.76s]  I'm parked illegally. Oh no. No truck. Use this to attach to multiple objects.
[1559.82s -> 1573.96s]  Let's go. Hey. Parking violation. What did you just throw at me? Get that. Whatever it is I want it.
[1575.37s -> 1594.25s]  Use notepad. Oh no. How do I get out of the truck? How do I get out? Shit. Get out
[1594.25s -> 1601.05s]  of the truck. Oh wait. Click it. Oh. This mount. There it is. All right. Give me this.
[1604.57s -> 1612.47s]  Double click on your target to shoot or throw things. Wait. You can. I didn't know you could
[1612.47s -> 1616.55s]  do that in this game. All right. What does he need? What does he want? Security guard. Add adjective.
[1617.43s -> 1646.46s]  Create object. Stick. Wait. Add adjective. Invincible. I don't think that did anything.
[1647.02s -> 1666.10s]  Create object. Are you happy yet? I just gave you a weapon. Why am I so dirty? I'm coming in
[1666.10s -> 1686.71s]  dirt. Stabbing this guy with a syringe. Did I take some money? Oh wait. He stole my syringe.
[1686.71s -> 1702.31s]  No. No. No. Apply the cheese to him. What is happening? Give me this back. No. No. No. No.
[1702.31s -> 1725.58s]  Get out. Get out. Get out. Just syringe him. What happens if you kill somebody? Oh. I can pet the
[1725.58s -> 1737.94s]  bug. Oh wait. I'm going to give him a friend. Hold on. Wait. I'm going to give him. I'm going
[1737.94s -> 1754.06s]  to make a friend. Cockroach. Look. Look it. We're all friends. Oh yes. My many cockroach friends.
[1756.71s -> 1762.89s]  Cockroach. Cockroach. Cockroach. Cool. They wanted a friend, right? Did I get stars for that?
[1767.43s -> 1783.82s]  Here. Have some food. I got you guys a bunch of cheese. Here. Everyone need to take one. Cheese
[1783.82s -> 1790.39s]  roach. That's disgusting. All right. Remove this. I need to clean myself up. I'm disgusting. I'm
[1790.39s -> 1811.99s]  dirty. All right. Great object. Err. Toothbrush. How do I use the toothbrush on me? Shower. That's
[1811.99s -> 1826.76s]  kind of a weird place to put a shower. All right. Go in the shower. Is this working? Okay. Clean in
[1827.64s -> 1843.32s]  adjective. What? Clean. Suspect. Cheesy. Invincible. What? What? Clean. Suspect. Cheesy.
[1843.32s -> 1857.61s]  Invincible. What does that mean? Clean. Ah. There we go. It's a camera for. Oh. All right. What's your
[1857.61s -> 1866.82s]  deal? Place someone into the phone booth to make a sidekick for me. Okay. All right. I'll make a

[5036.54s -> 5040.86s]  and then come down here and put a TV monitor in front of them. I can't do that apparently.
[5040.86s -> 5066.58s]  How about a fan? Can't do anything right. At least me and the birds can be friends.
[5076.12s -> 5081.05s]  That was a double kill. They're still alive down here. Yeah, see, they're fine.
[5081.13s -> 5092.73s]  All right, there's three more. Ban links. No, I'm not clicking on links right now.

[5263.16s -> 5270.90s]  rideable. I will. Hold on. I got to get this right. It's upside down. Can I rotate this?
[5271.54s -> 5299.66s]  I can rotate it when it's two pieces. Oh, drop it. Okay, there we go. Okay, now, hold on.
[5300.22s -> 5316.97s]  Adjective. Rideable. This is a rideable wood and rideable steel wood. No, what am I doing?
[5322.44s -> 5349.90s]  See, look, it works. I'm telling you. Get off. No, get the fuck off of this thing, man. Okay,

[5723.80s -> 5734.90s]  Fast. Rideable. Fish. Just make a boat. What'd you guys call me, boring berry? If I type the word
[5734.90s -> 5746.94s]  boat and put it in the water, isn't that boring berry? You guys gotta pick a side. Huge boat.
[5754.34s -> 5797.46s]  Air- air propelled. All right, here. Come on, let's go. Can I not save this guy? Now go. Give him a

[5892.79s -> 5909.02s]  how about a hat? Here. Yes. There he goes. Oh. Turn a station wagon into a fire engine.
[5909.82s -> 5919.86s]  That was so cute. Okay, all the fire engines are busy. This car needs to become a fire truck. Start
[5919.86s -> 5944.66s]  by painting the car. All right. Uh, what are we gonna paint? What? Red? Blood. How about ketchup?
[5949.70s -> 5983.30s]  That's technically red. Keyed car. Blood. You can't do blood. Use the ketchup on the car. Can I do
[5983.30s -> 6009.43s]  that? Oh, shit. It didn't work. I mean, that's easy. Dude, it's just red. Car needs to be heard.
[6009.43s -> 6028.54s]  Give the DJ something loud to hook up to the car. Um, sure. Fire alarm. That's a school bell.
[6029.77s -> 6032.97s]  Fireman's almost ready to head out. Give him a tool that will help get the job done.
[6041.29s -> 6049.19s]  It's an axe or it's a fire extinguisher. This is a boring streak. Yeah, but like, yeah, you have to
[6049.19s -> 6072.98s]  do it. Yeah. I can't paint the car with blood. Uh, okay. Give me a firefighting tool. It's a bottle
[6072.98s -> 6089.26s]  of water. That'll do it. How about a hose? Oh, I attached it to his eye. Oh shit. Here,
[6089.26s -> 6110.98s]  now take another one. I just like blocked both of his eyes. Bye. Oh no, there's a traffic jam.

[6135.56s -> 6141.54s]  Let me think about this creatively. I could just put a fan here. With the balloons on there,
[6141.54s -> 6149.05s]  I could. Okay. Yeah. We're going to, we're going to do the balloon strategy catapult. Hold on. How

[6210.39s -> 6229.82s]  Let's burn that fire. Okay. How about this burning? Let's test the fire alarm. Oh,
[6230.62s -> 6238.70s]  wait, I can't get up there. Why not play sound? Take turn. Give me that.
[6247.00s -> 6263.32s]  I want to climb this. That's cheating. Fire alarm on this floor is functional. Oh, is it?
[6266.78s -> 6280.78s]  The wings too big to go up there. I just took off all my clothes. Give me these back. Why can't I
[6280.78s -> 6294.49s]  just climb this? Oh, I, uh, test that. What do you guys need? You snore so loudly. I can't sleep.
[6295.21s -> 6326.06s]  Okay. Uh, that work. It didn't work. You put that. No, take it off. Take it off. Take it off. I'm
[6326.06s -> 6341.64s]  sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Muscles didn't work. Okay. How about, um, a, I'm not going
[6341.64s -> 6357.38s]  to do pillow. Make him deaf. No earplugs. Yeah, but that's so, all right. Earplugs works.
[6359.19s -> 6366.55s]  So, so his mouth shut. I think you underestimate the things you can do in scribble knots.
[6367.35s -> 6404.97s]  Did he just start? Oh, he fell asleep. He, no, he didn't. What's going on? Why is he thinking of
[6404.97s -> 6410.23s]  sheep so much? He fell asleep because I gave him the pillow. So he didn't even care. Oh, okay.
[6411.03s -> 6430.89s]  What do you need? I can't find my helmet anywhere. Here, I got it. Did I just put a diaper in your
[6430.89s -> 6445.21s]  makeup cabinet? That's a surprise for later. Uh, how about a top hat? No, this is not my helmet.
[6445.21s -> 6452.74s]  Mine's in my locker. Give me that back. You don't want it. I'll take it. Wait, is her locker the one
[6452.74s -> 6480.79s]  that burnt? Oh, sorry. Uh, ma'am, I'm going to need that back. There. What are you doing up here?
[6482.25s -> 6486.73s]  Ooh, this is a big one. Help the survivors defend against the zombie invasion.
[6487.45s -> 6508.70s]  Did I put on new clothes? Uh, the city has been overrun by zombies. Each of the survivors
[6508.70s -> 6516.06s]  needs some help. Start by helping the doctor treat the fireman's wounds. I got it. Medicine.
[6516.06s -> 6537.77s]  What's wrong with him? He's sick. What's wrong with him though? Um, pills. Pills. Pill. Here,
[6537.77s -> 6549.72s]  take this pill. Why do you have to get on top of it? What the fuck was that? This is the gamer's
[6549.72s -> 6555.11s]  dream. Give her something to help fend off the horde. Oh, it's a gamer's dream. All right,
[6555.91s -> 6578.46s]  drag it down. All right, here. What do you need?
[6587.26s -> 6592.38s]  I know, I get it. All right, it's a gamer's dream. It's not a gamer's dream. Nobody wants to actually
[6592.38s -> 6598.97s]  be in a zombie apocalypse. That would suck. You would die in 10 minutes. Oh man, I got a plan.
[6598.97s -> 6603.53s]  I would go to the grocery store and I would bring like an axe and I'd be fucking killing zombies.
[6603.53s -> 6606.81s]  No, you'd get bit. You would, you would take a swing at a zombie and you'd hit it in like
[6606.81s -> 6610.73s]  the fucking shin and the thing would grab you and two more would grab you and you would get bit in
[6610.73s -> 6623.75s]  the neck and you're dead instantly. But like here, how about a katana? Yeah, of course a katana.
[6624.47s -> 6645.18s]  What do you need? Yeah, you know why it's a dull katana? Because, because you bought it from,
[6645.18s -> 6658.17s]  you bought it from like fucking QVC. It's, it's not, it's a display. I'm so scared. Make me feel
[6658.17s -> 6672.12s]  better. You're now happy. Happy orphan. Apparently. No, no, no, I'm scared. You could be scared and
[6672.12s -> 6701.78s]  happy, right? Um, not scared. Zombie, zombie orphan. Well, if you would, if you were a zombie,
[6701.78s -> 6713.00s]  you wouldn't be scared of them anymore because you would just be one. All right, let's go.
[6713.64s -> 6730.41s]  Who's what you locked in here? Okay. All right, let's go. Uh, uh, pills. Take it. Go ahead. Next
[6730.97s -> 6734.49s]  gamer. What are the, what are the, what are the like fantasies that gamers have in zombie
[6734.49s -> 6763.35s]  apocalypses? Sawed off shotgun. Yeah. Calm her down. Okay. Uh, teddy bear, teddy bear, a teddy.
[6763.91s -> 6773.69s]  I worked for drugs. No, the soldier is convinced that a few simple objects can be combined to make
[6773.69s -> 6804.49s]  a fighting machine. Place three objects inside the box to make a mech. Okay. Microwave and coaster
[6804.49s -> 6821.62s]  and coffee maker. If your power is combined, you will make a kitchen appliance monster.
[6822.18s -> 6840.54s]  What are you doing? It's not a mech. You what? It's a three objects. You doing it?
[6841.10s -> 6848.81s]  I could use anything made of metal or something sticky. Oh, well, I got a glue. You didn't tell
[6848.81s -> 6873.99s]  me how to put the glue in there too. Um, it put like just a cheese sauce in there. Why does the
[6873.99s -> 6893.98s]  cheese sauce have health? All right. Microwave, toaster and, um, slime. Oh, you added something
[6894.06s -> 6913.78s]  sticky that can be used to join the parts together. All right, let's go. I need a weapon. Um, a
[6914.66s -> 6936.04s]  butcher knife, rocket launcher, code, laser, um, toenail, flamethrower, drill, a dentist drill,
[6936.60s -> 6966.01s]  a nail clipper, spear. Yeah. Here it comes. It's the final ingredient. Read the prompt.
[6966.01s -> 6982.49s]  It's three objects inside the box to make a mech. It's on the soldier.
[6983.80s -> 6994.57s]  Most electronic devices need a similar power. So, oh, come on. There you go. Come on. I can't
[6994.57s -> 7010.06s]  just put an outlet in there. Why? How about a, uh, gasoline? There it is. It's not what I put in
[7010.06s -> 7016.63s]  there. Distract the zombies while the other survivors escape. Hop in the mech when you're
[7016.63s -> 7028.47s]  ready to begin. Distract the zombies while the others escape. Okay. Get in the robot. Hold on.
[7029.03s -> 7050.78s]  Not yet. I want like a bunch of warrior clowns. Tasty, tasty clowns.
[7060.94s -> 7064.06s]  No, no. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out of that. Get out of that. That's for me,
[7064.06s -> 7080.57s]  not for you. All right. This is another tasty clown. Okay. This one's going to be a delicious
[7080.57s -> 7089.77s]  clown. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't think so. Where are you going?
[7090.65s -> 7109.45s]  Oh my God. They're running away because of the zombies. What the fuck? Oh, you're getting over
[7109.45s -> 7145.53s]  there. Fire. He's bait. He's a zombie now. That's so funny. Now what? Fire missiles at the zombies
[7145.53s -> 7178.44s]  while everyone escapes. That's what I'm doing. All right. Got it. Wait, make an explosive clown?
[7187.06s -> 7201.34s]  All right. We're good. Is he going to go inside? Explosive clown fetish? What the hell are you
[7201.34s -> 7225.42s]  talking about? Succulent clown. Watch out. You're going to get taken away. Oh man. We have more
[7225.42s -> 7229.58s]  area. How about castle? All right. How about go piss? That sounds like a good idea. I'll be right back.
[7337.64s -> 7415.83s]  Okay. Time. Time. How long? How long? How long have I been gone for? How long have I been gone
[7415.83s -> 7428.71s]  for? Give me an exact how long I've been actually gone for. Two minutes and what? Two minutes and
[7428.71s -> 7438.73s]  11 seconds. Okay. I was peeing the almost entire time I was gone. It took me about
[7439.62s -> 7444.90s]  five or six seconds to leave the room and about five or six seconds to come back into the room.
[7445.70s -> 7453.00s]  That was the longest pee I've ever done in my entire life. That was insane. I don't understand.
[7453.00s -> 7463.05s]  It made no sense. How was that possible? Did you wash your hands? Yes, I did. I didn't wash your
[7463.05s -> 7477.88s]  hands. Of course I did. I did. I did. Yes, I did. I wash my hands every time. I don't. That was the
[7477.88s -> 7481.08s]  that was it. It was actually fucked up. Like I'm actually concerned about that. I just peed for
[7481.08s -> 7491.99s]  like fucking a full two minutes. Let's go to the forest. Welcome to Meta forest. Oh, there's another
[7491.99s -> 7514.42s]  scribble mouse guy. Hungry mosquito. Loaded hungry mosquito. What do you want? Help the scout earn
[7514.42s -> 7527.27s]  his merit badge. We're gonna cut this down. All right, you want to do a test here to see if I can
[7527.27s -> 7537.61s]  do every single one of these tasks with the grenade? What's going on here? Give me a tool to carve this
[7537.61s -> 7572.95s]  log. Sharp grenade. I don't think I would ever want. Okay, like sharp grenade? Holy shit, he actually
[7572.95s -> 7584.70s]  did it. Fire safety is next. Give the scout something to put out the dummy. Sure, I can do that.
[7585.34s -> 7602.14s]  Remember this? Oh, I didn't blow that up, right? I had to add a sharp like water grenade.
[7602.94s -> 7627.62s]  There. Why did you pull the pin? You don't pull the pin. It was already water covered.
[7628.34s -> 7633.32s]  Give me something to fix the dummy's wounds. How about a medical grenade?
[7637.30s -> 7660.54s]  Heal it. A healing grenade. Healing grenade. Here. Look, it's healing. He's gonna throw it.
[7660.54s -> 7677.98s]  Give the scout proper safety equipment. You just, you just like spawn drop this? A safety
[7677.98s -> 7696.31s]  grenade. Yeah, all right. I'm gonna give you a nice safety grenade. Okay. Am I saying that wrong?
[7699.32s -> 7723.00s]  Safe grenade. Give me that back. Resistant grenade. A protective grenade. Interact with what?
[7726.41s -> 7747.86s]  Oh, it's a safety grenade. Don't worry. Oh, no, no, no, no. The instructor is shit faced.
[7747.86s -> 7754.09s]  And he, I think he just like snorted three lines. Hey, look everybody. No, it's made out of,
[7754.09s -> 7768.92s]  I swear it's made out of Play-Doh. With his teeth. Here, why don't you take a saw, man?
[7771.82s -> 7787.32s]  Oh, put that fire out and just come over here and help me, man. Man, I thought I'd give you a...

[10577.75s -> 10615.14s]  huge dragon. Why am I on it? Why is he wet? Why am I still wet? Did I do everything? Oh, ghost hunter.
[10615.14s -> 10631.67s]  I got it. Why do I have a gun? Where are the kids? Okay. I'm just saying. I just, that freaked me
[10631.67s -> 10633.99s]  out for a second. I was like, why are there spiders everywhere? And where are the kids?
[10634.55s -> 10644.76s]  It was all a dream. All right. All right. Let's keep going. Let's go to, I don't know what this is.
[10644.76s -> 10666.60s]  Let's do it. The underline. I still have a gun. I'm so hungry and this machine is empty. Oh,

[10735.26s -> 10741.64s]  for it. All right. Take it out. Take it out. I just made a new word. Okay. I didn't do an adjective.
[10742.73s -> 10767.93s]  All right. Disgusting edible grass. Eat it. Just eat it, man. It's not a big deal. Fine. Here.
[10786.81s -> 10800.18s]  It has to be edible. Okay. Here you go. You don't want this delicious edible trash?
[10800.98s -> 10827.85s]  What is this? Wrapper? All right. Go get it. Oh, just throw this away. All right. There you go.
[10827.85s -> 10862.82s]  Delicious wrapper in there. I'm so hungry. This machine is empty. How is a glass raw? No, no,
[10862.82s -> 10903.34s]  stop, stop, stop. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Just put it down. It's going to break. Don't touch that.
[10903.34s -> 10947.35s]  It's not ready. It's not ready. I mean, you can put the adjectives in while you make the object though.
[10947.35s -> 10981.90s]  Why won't he buy this? He has money for a coin. Take that and spend it on this. An edible vending
[10981.90s -> 11006.54s]  machine in the edible vending machine. I can't. I can't. I can't. Hold on. What happened? Why won't
[11006.54s -> 11034.04s]  he go? Why won't he buy this? Did I fuck it up somehow? He needs a wallet. Oh, reset. How
[11034.04s -> 11042.18s]  did I get over here? All right. Well, new thing. I want to buy something from that stand, but I'm
[11042.18s -> 11086.39s]  broke. What an IOU. No, not the ICU. What about valuable bacon? There you go. You have valuable
[11086.39s -> 11116.46s]  trash. What do you want to buy? Uh, a what's the opposite of frugal? You just don't give a shit.
[11119.75s -> 11133.26s]  Not stingy, generous, opulent. The game know that word. All right. They made the transaction.
[11134.39s -> 11155.29s]  Uh, valuable trash for a bag of money. Yeah, it's one coin. You don't even have this back.
[11160.10s -> 11165.90s]  Oh, wait. Old ladies help walking across the sewer. I'm tired of standing. All right. Let's make a
[11165.90s -> 11204.55s]  chair. What just happened? Doesn't have any wheels. Help the street performer develop his career as a
[11204.55s -> 11217.88s]  rock star. Let's go. Should have done electric chair. Oh fucking God. No one even said that in
[11217.88s -> 11223.14s]  chat. I just pretended that they did. He wants to be a rock star. First needs a better instrument
[11223.14s -> 11245.74s]  to help him rock. Okay. It's better. Yeah. That sucks, dude. I was kind of hoping that. Wait,
[11246.46s -> 11258.78s]  hold on a minute. Like a musically talented animal. How about, um, a talented, uh, talented
[11258.78s -> 11278.31s]  chimpanzee. And we're going to give him a guitar. This instrument is awesome, but my bandwagon
[11278.31s -> 11286.73s]  sounded a lot better with additional members. All right. Well, hold on. So we need more members,
[11286.73s -> 11304.86s]  talented chimpanzee, musical gorilla, your lead singer. That's what I call a band. What we need
[11304.86s -> 11311.30s]  now is equipment to put on a real show. What happened to my character? Why does he look like
[11311.30s -> 11326.84s]  this? Uh, lights. Is he going to hold it up like a lighter? He's going to like, he's going to hold
[11326.84s -> 11344.87s]  it up with like a people to the phones now, right? Uh, what, um, stage. All right, here we go. Let's
[11344.87s -> 11362.42s]  start the party. You know how horrifying this would be if the street performer on the subway
[11363.46s -> 11373.51s]  had a gorilla and a chimpanzee just walking around. Oh my God, that'd be horrifying.
[11374.46s -> 11378.62s]  I don't care how well-trained a gorilla is. I don't care how friendly in quotes a gorilla is.
[11379.34s -> 11385.50s]  It takes a 10th of a second for them to like, not like the logo on your shirt or something.
[11385.50s -> 11388.14s]  And boom, your head is smashed into a thousand pieces.
[11392.06s -> 11407.30s]  Nope. I don't care how well-trained they are. That's scary. That was a Joe Rogan. That was a Joe
[11407.30s -> 11426.12s]  Rogan bit. All that shit up Jamie. Did he say that before? He's getting closer and closer to dying.
[11426.12s -> 11447.93s]  All right. What about back here? Sewer runoff. Yeah, let's go to the sewer. Well, okay. What
[11447.93s -> 11473.74s]  we got? The other fish keep making fun of me. Help me scare them away. A gun photo.
[11474.78s -> 11496.14s]  Oh, picture of a picture or gun. Oh, how about just gun picture? Golf picture. Here,
[11496.86s -> 11522.63s]  give it to him. You can't do gun guys. Gun and knife don't work. You need to make them like big,
[11523.35s -> 11538.20s]  inflated, like huge. Wait, he's gonna fly. Okay. He's dead. I'm ready for a new school to move in.
[11539.56s -> 11570.97s]  Ooh, crate. Um, cuppy. Come on in. Yeah. What's wrong with you? Blowing large goldfish. I've always
[11570.97s -> 11581.19s]  lived down here and don't know what I look like. Attack. I'm not deaf. We need to give him a mirror.
[11603.13s -> 11607.61s]  Wait, did I just like tell him that beauty is on the inside in a weird metaphorical way?
[11608.25s -> 11626.44s]  Oh, all right. Oh, he's scared. Oh, well, wait, let's go. You're too slow.
[11630.33s -> 11646.02s]  I'm sorry, but it's fine. You can be slow if you want. Make him fast. That's not very fast.
[11653.78s -> 11688.14s]  Speedy. I can't even fit down the hallway. All right, let's go. You and I are friends.
[11688.14s -> 11703.91s]  What's this even here? Oh, there's a guy down here. Be a bro and help me break free.
[11710.62s -> 11721.98s]  Be a bro. Oh, he was a criminal. He was a criminal. Oh, he was a criminal. I was supposed to like
[11721.98s -> 11735.21s]  kill him. Is that what it wanted me to do? Why was it? Did I not get the star for that? It was
[11735.21s -> 11738.41s]  help me break free. And it was like, you broke the criminal for you. Did the game want me to like,
[11739.21s -> 11746.84s]  why is there a cage down here? Was he like a murderer or something? I don't get it.
[11747.48s -> 11760.17s]  That was my brother. What am I talking about? He was my brother. I don't know. There's a cage
[11760.17s -> 11763.85s]  down here and he's throwing it. It's like, oh, you'll let the criminal free. I don't know. Wait,
[11764.17s -> 11770.33s]  you might have killed 10 people. I don't know. Oh, that was fun. Let's go. Can I take him with me?
[11777.77s -> 11784.92s]  Wait, fill the cage with something. I'm not putting him in the cage. I know a ton of you guys are
[11784.92s -> 11797.32s]  going to be like, oh, I put him nowhere. Not in a million years. Save the lobsters. Fool the fishermen
[11797.32s -> 11843.26s]  by filling their trap with something else to eat. Someone just sponges. It's because it was electric.
[11848.89s -> 11858.76s]  Yeah, put the electric huge, like 10,000 watt device down here with me. But wait,
[11858.76s -> 11865.62s]  didn't we talk about this already when that not happened? I told you guys, listen, for those that
[11865.62s -> 11873.86s]  weren't here like a year ago, me and chat got into a big fight because I said, hey, like if you drop
[11873.86s -> 11878.02s]  a fucking toaster plugged in into the ocean, like will it shock the, what would happen? What happens?
[11879.77s -> 11884.09s]  Everyone's like, you're crazy. No, no, no. What would have shocked the whole thing?
[11884.81s -> 11895.83s]  It was a hit man. Yeah. Okay. Let's, let's do something bigger than that. The whole ocean.
[11895.83s -> 11901.35s]  No. Okay. What if you were, hold on, but what if you were standing like a hundred feet away
[11901.35s -> 11910.82s]  of where it was dropped in? No, you asked. I wait, I am totally, I'm totally just like
[11910.82s -> 11915.38s]  gaslighting you guys on this. I asked if I dropped my iPhone in the bathtub, if I was in it, if it
[11915.38s -> 11926.71s]  would kill me. Oh, right, right, right, right. Okay. Lightning hits the ocean all the time.
[11926.71s -> 11929.27s]  All right. But what if you were in, don't, don't they tell you to get out of the water
[11929.83s -> 11950.12s]  during a storm? I thought that was a big deal. They do say that. Yeah, they do. What's taller
[11950.12s -> 11964.25s]  than the ocean. That's in case lighting hits you. Oh, he's alive. All right. Put some edible in here.
[11976.22s -> 12001.40s]  Can't move this. They're saying light, holdable, edible diaper in there. Pick up. There we go.
[12001.40s -> 12019.94s]  Okay. So this is, it's in there. He didn't eat that, did he? Oh shit, he did. Wait, he's already
[12019.94s -> 12034.92s]  like toxic. All right. What did they want me to do? No, don't, don't, it's a, do not put that,
[12034.92s -> 12052.33s]  something else. I just did the thing that they were trying to do. They're going to pull that up
[12052.33s -> 12070.68s]  and they're going to be like, ah, eh, remove the waste. There must be a better way to dispose of
[12070.68s -> 12122.26s]  this. Eat edible, vegan, edible, vegan, rich, edible, vegan. Right. Okay. Hold on. Hungry, vegan,
[12122.26s -> 12138.92s]  vegan, edible, toxic waste. I spell hungry wrong. It's my way. It's not, it's not hungry. Yes, it
[12138.92s -> 12175.93s]  is. Tasty, tasty, tasty, vegetarian. What did I just do? Hey, a tasty vegetarian. Okay. Edible
[12175.93s -> 12201.70s]  broccoli toxic waste. But, um, as Matt leaning, I just blow it up. Vegan, edible, toxic waste.
[12201.70s -> 12212.36s]  Then we have a glowing large vegetarian starving goldfish. Vegan, edible, toxic waste.
[12216.84s -> 12236.15s]  Make it non-toxic. Okay. Edible, non-toxic. What? Really? So I'll just make the toxic material
[12236.15s -> 12252.44s]  non-toxic. That's it. Oh, well, I guess it was that easy. All right. Now we got a few,
[12252.44s -> 12254.68s]  I want to go to one of the later areas over here. Let's go to the fountain.
[12256.46s -> 12276.62s]  And a four falls. That's drunk. What are they doing? Bring shock off, bring shock off. Bring. Can I,
[12277.26s -> 12285.02s]  can I bring nothing? I can't feel the sunlight by the river. It creates something to help me tan.
[12285.90s -> 12310.76s]  This is his like human skin and his jerky body. Oh, come here. Give me this.
[12311.48s -> 12335.83s]  But this should have put, yeah, I want to put, I want to take this. Whoa, frog. Place something
[12335.83s -> 12362.66s]  in between these logs to help me cross the river. Didn't help. How about some logs? How about a
[12362.66s -> 12381.98s]  bridge? So, but that's so easy to do, right? It's, oh, I made a bridge. Wow. Turn a businessman into
[12381.98s -> 12416.79s]  a fisherman. Nah, not yet. Hey, look what I got, man. Natural, natural, non-human. Uh, this person's
[12416.79s -> 12424.97s]  dead. What am I doing? Oh, shit. Hold on. What's wrong? Trying marketer. Please reunite me with my
[12424.97s -> 12454.22s]  love. What? This person's dead? Oh, okay. Who resurrects people? Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
[12454.78s -> 12465.80s]  No, not all of us. He did it to the frog. Oh, shit. He's actually a Diablo two necromancer.
[12467.37s -> 12480.68s]  All right. I'm sorry, but I'm going to give me a steak. Stab him through the fucking heart.
[12486.02s -> 12515.24s]  All right. Now I release you. Whoa. I, I'm, whatever. Leave me alone. Give it to me.
[12527.51s -> 12541.56s]  Cleanse the undead. Okay. Cleanse. No, now I need a priest. What the fuck is a priest going to do?
[12541.56s -> 12551.11s]  No, I need like a paladin. All right. Paladin. There we go. All right. Save me. Holy shit.
[12551.11s -> 12555.59s]  That, all right. Sorry. That's my bad. That's my bad. That's my bad. I spawned a level one paladin.
[12556.66s -> 12566.54s]  That, that's what would happen. Okay. What a shitty character. How about a sorcerer?
[12566.54s -> 12582.15s]  Go get it. How do I, how do you suppose, Zamboni? What is that? They're dead? Oh, they are dead.
[12582.15s -> 12605.70s]  I'll take the septid though. What? What? Being a businessman, how to fish. This man dreams of
[12605.70s -> 12619.88s]  being a fisherman. Start by dressing him appropriately. Fisherman hat. Fibered hat.
[12621.16s -> 12631.18s]  Firm, a fishable hat. Yes. That's exactly what I was thinking of. Next, he needs to catch some
[12631.18s -> 12646.87s]  fish. Give him an object to reel them in. Bass is not biting. Place something in the water that it
[12646.87s -> 12679.62s]  wants. Fish like cheese, right? Nice. Oh, it's an even bigger one. Time to catch the rainbow halibut.
[12679.62s -> 12707.59s]  It has more colorful taste. Oh, I like eating colorful food. Sherbert. Good catch. Now I have
[12707.59s -> 12729.62s]  to catch a fudge megalodon. Give the megalodon its dinner. No, it's going to kill it. What's a
[12729.62s -> 12736.36s]  megalodon's favorite dinner? It's like, it's like people or other huge, or how about like blue whale?
[12736.92s -> 12755.78s]  How big is this? It's huge, right? What's for dinner? It's a fudge megalodon.
[12760.12s -> 12807.46s]  Uh, no. There. Hooray! You did it. That's a big dolphin. That's definitely rideable too. He just
[12807.46s -> 12817.37s]  like went off and like nibbled on his grenade actually. Wait, you just turned it into a
[12817.37s -> 12821.86s]  skeleton. What'd you just do? You turned something into a skeleton to kill it. What was that? Help me
[12821.86s -> 12840.06s]  sail again. Oh, okay. Uh, here. What the fuck are you doing? She's going after the priest. The priest
[12840.06s -> 12849.70s]  bailed the fuck out of here and got out and was safe. She's going after the priest. She'd known
[12849.70s -> 12858.09s]  he peeked his head up behind the rock. He was like, are they gone yet? Oh shit. Help me sail again.
[12858.97s -> 12887.88s]  Okay. Um, what did I just get? I leveled up something. Oh, you stole the scepter. Wait,
[12887.88s -> 12904.95s]  did she just take that from you? What happened here? Okay. Help me sail again. Wait, there's a
[12904.95s -> 12911.50s]  big fish over there. What am I doing? The priest became a holy warrior. Oh, okay. All right. Let's
[12911.50s -> 12950.89s]  fix this boat. Uh, fix the engine. Fuck this. Let's use this one. Glue broken on boat. Blue.
[12951.53s -> 12985.74s]  Okay. Well, should I, I gotta get it out of the water. Look at these all alive. Balloons.
[12985.74s -> 12989.58s]  Why would a balloon take like a 10,000 pound, 20,000 pound boat out of the water?
[12990.14s -> 13014.26s]  Strong balloon. Okay. I gotta get rid of this thing. I hate this thing. All right. Come on,
[13014.26s -> 13035.19s]  pull it up. There it is. All right. What's wrong with it? It's got a problem. What we need to do?
[13035.19s -> 13055.51s]  Fix, uh, blue. All right. Stick that on there. Technically, it did it. This bird over here is
[13055.51s -> 13063.70s]  like, holy shit. You see what was just in the sky? Okay. I noticed an attack and shot a crossbow at
[13063.70s -> 13079.16s]  it. It was flex seal. Yeah. That's pretty, yeah. It was flex seal. How do I get up there? I'm here
[13079.16s -> 13097.13s]  with flex seal. I can even put it over my mouth to make me stop talking. I don't kill that bird.
[13097.13s -> 13102.18s]  Let the bird up. Why is there a bird? What the, why was there a bird in there? Why was there a
[13102.18s -> 13118.47s]  bird inside of the chest? I don't even know who that was. I, I, I'm going to say this and I don't
[13118.47s -> 13123.70s]  know if it's real or not, but I'm going to just think it is. You know how there are people make
[13123.70s -> 13132.39s]  slime videos. I feel like flex seal is some of that kind of stuff like flex putty and flex seal.
[13132.39s -> 13136.07s]  Do people make videos of them just like scooping it up and smearing it all over a
[13136.07s -> 13155.13s]  piece of wood or something? I would assume, right? Holy shit. I love this guy. Help me
[13155.13s -> 13179.69s]  practice my painting. Paintbrush. Wow. It's beautiful. I love it. What's going on over here?
[13180.97s -> 13185.67s]  Help me take a picture with this local. I want to dance, but I don't have a beat to follow.
[13185.67s -> 13207.67s]  I can solve that very quickly. Does that count? I'm going to take a picture.
[13208.23s -> 13230.30s]  You don't have a camera? Here, camera. Take it. Oh, I have the photo. Did it work? I think it
[13230.30s -> 13239.35s]  worked. The gorilla has something he wants. We only allow gorillas in our troop and you are no
[13239.35s -> 13299.27s]  gorilla. Yet. Get these wings off. I can't go in the gorilla suit? Oh shit. I didn't want to do that.
[13299.27s -> 13309.86s]  Take your clothes off. I don't have any clothes on. We only allow gorillas. You are no gorilla.
[13310.42s -> 13341.99s]  Move out of the way. Get out of the way. Blind them? No, that didn't work. Uh, where is this
[13341.99s -> 13349.03s]  person? No, no, they're not going to walk off the edge. They don't have that kind of pathing.
[13349.03s -> 13386.62s]  I need a gorilla costume. Get in. No, it didn't. Okay. A monkey suit. Why can't I wear it? You
[13386.62s -> 13408.52s]  have to edit your avatar? No. Edit your adjectives. Suspect small gorilla like? Gorilla mask? No.
[13409.08s -> 13424.31s]  Gorilla like. A gorilla like mask. We only allow gorillas. Wait, you're going to take the eye thing
[13424.31s -> 13434.39s]  off so you can see. Hey, look at me. I'm a gorilla. Look, you only allow gorillas and you are no
[13434.39s -> 13454.81s]  gorilla. What? He's not blind? Is he blind? Look, I'm one of you. Good sized fatherly musical silver
[13454.81s -> 13465.10s]  back gorilla. Motherly musical silver back gorilla. The suit on the, on the chimp? What are you talking
[13465.10s -> 13472.78s]  about? There's too many of these. Greet each monkey's human friend. What about the monkey?

[13786.57s -> 13813.06s]  All supervillains have an evil animal companion. I need one. Uh, what do you. Okay. Why was he
[13813.06s -> 13817.46s]  swinging that at me? That was weird. We need someone who would want to watch these televisions

[13895.21s -> 13905.21s]  Conceal something in my cake to help my friend burrow through the prison walls.
[13945.99s -> 13959.43s]  That two or three seconds later, that was a distance explosion. You're letting
[13959.43s -> 13965.14s]  criminals out of prison. Whatever. All right. Let's do this one. What's this?
[13967.66s -> 13970.70s]  Each prisoner, eh, give him a reminder of home.
[13985.51s -> 13990.20s]  Baste, base, base. What, what? I was bored. I want to do those based.
[13991.32s -> 13994.28s]  Each person needs a cellmate that they have something in common with.
[13995.00s -> 14012.12s]  Okay. He wants to be involved with sports. Eh, how about a coach? Here we are. I thought they
[14012.12s -> 14016.66s]  were zombies for a second. The halfling was captured during an important quest. Give the
[14016.66s -> 14032.36s]  halfling a member of her adventuring party. A wizard. Saxophone player misses making music

[14346.66s -> 14359.30s]  DVD. You don't want the brand new console. You're a gamer and you love anime. How about that? A

[14538.57s -> 14548.26s]  I'm going to do a speedrun. Let's get everybody's stuff that they want and just put them down here
[14548.26s -> 14559.86s]  right now. If everybody a monkey. Okay, here we go. We want, we're going to do a coach.

[14676.33s -> 14691.48s]  What the hell is in here? Why is this in here? Why did you just shit out a nuclear bomb?
[14698.04s -> 14724.31s]  Why is the gamer in here? That can scientific opinion. Let's get it. Let's get a garlic
[14724.31s -> 14753.66s]  scientist's opinion on this whole thing. Game of the year. It's literally the red button meme.

[14760.94s -> 14766.71s]  that you all here. Here it comes. Good. I got to get the fuck out of here now before something bad
[14766.71s -> 14773.61s]  happens. I didn't press it. I didn't press the button. I didn't press it. I didn't press it.
[14773.61s -> 14788.04s]  Why are they killing each other? Criminal sledgehammer? Why is there a criminal sledgehammer?

[14938.17s -> 14943.56s]  Hooray. Show me something that the Easter bunny likes. Living here hinders my creativity. Help
[14943.56s -> 14967.78s]  me paint this egg. Blonde egg. Oh, that's the same color. We didn't do anything. Help Maxwell escape
[14967.78s -> 14987.96s]  from the prison. Maxwell needs to escape prison. Give the tired guard a place to sit and he might
[14987.96s -> 15008.49s]  unlock the gate. All right, get off of it. Iron maiden. The guard unlocked the door. Now a ghost
[15008.49s -> 15013.37s]  stands in the way. He can't open the door without a physical presence. All right,
[15013.37s -> 15036.34s]  are you going to get off of it? Just get off. I just took his only defense. Get off. You idiot.
[15038.26s -> 15067.83s]  I'm going to kill this chair. All right, let's go. It doesn't fit in here.
[15067.83s -> 15081.86s]  Whatever. It's a place to sit down. I repeat. I'm under attack by the chair. Need backup.
[15082.42s -> 15124.07s]  I need a physical body. Sure. Hey, it worked. The ghost scared the door open. Now a prisoner is
[15124.07s -> 15141.11s]  craving a hearty meal. Give him something filling. Hmm. Hearty meal. Eggs benedict. Eggs benedict.
[15141.11s -> 15170.97s]  Over easy. Over easy benedict. How is it? Prisoner destroyed the door. A con man has agreed to help
[15170.97s -> 15177.27s]  Maxwell. But he needs to disguise himself as an officer to fool the camera. This guy has a
[15177.27s -> 15211.32s]  cannibal. He need a disguise. How about a police officer outfit? Police oiled? Police official.
[15211.96s -> 15245.22s]  Pricy official costume. What? No, I called uniforms. Police uniform. Who the hell is this?
[15245.22s -> 15249.83s]  Running the security system is a lonely job. The programmer has been here for too long and misses
[15249.83s -> 15286.31s]  his furry pet. Even man's best friend. How do I go down? This guy's a fucking idiot. Me or the guy
[15286.31s -> 15294.47s]  in the game? Because I was going to make him a furry iguana. I didn't want to just do dog.
[15294.55s -> 15328.52s]  That's too easy. Idiot adjective. Whatever. Santa Claus up here. Move out of the way.
[15328.52s -> 15355.32s]  Shovel. Alright. Werewolf. I want a fang from that werewolf. Open the door. Open the door.
[15359.26s -> 15366.97s]  Oh, I have to do it. What's wrong Santa? This prison food does not follow my strict fattening
[15366.97s -> 15384.20s]  diet. Just ate lard off the ground. That's disgusting. Reach the starite in the tower.
[15393.21s -> 15398.66s]  Mayo. Lard and mayo aren't the same thing. Complete the gauntlet to reach the starite.
[15398.66s -> 15413.18s]  Begin by getting out of this room. Sure. Box on here. Good. Alright. Gotta get through safely.
[15413.82s -> 15451.34s]  Sprinkler. Turn on the sprinkler. Nice. Beware falling objects. Hard hat. What? The robot guard
[15451.34s -> 15460.25s]  stands watch. Quickly make it to safety. Oh shit, he has a... Oh my god, he has a shield.
[15460.25s -> 15491.14s]  Shield. Shield. Shield. Shield. Shield. Shield. Shoot him. What just happened? Mobile game.
[15491.14s -> 15496.78s]  I know exactly what you're talking about. I get that ad all the time. Where it's like, no!
[15498.78s -> 15504.09s]  We're gonna save them from the fire! And you have to pull the three things on the edges.
[15504.73s -> 15508.01s]  And this one makes the water go in and there's like a princess. She's like, no, no!
[15508.89s -> 15515.78s]  No! The guy underneath. And then guess what? That shit ain't even in that game. I've played
[15515.78s -> 15525.48s]  that game before. That is the ad for Homescapes and I've played that game. That doesn't even
[15525.48s -> 15529.56s]  happen in that game. That's a match three game. What? That didn't happen in my game.
[15530.28s -> 15556.97s]  They've recently banned those ads. Did they really? On what grounds? Why? Because of false...
[15556.97s -> 15569.66s]  Really? That actually happened. That's so funny. That wasn't even in the fucking game.
[15570.38s -> 15608.09s]  Watch out for the spikes. Uncreative. I already did this one. Your character kind of looks like
[15612.41s -> 15616.50s]  my character does look like this. That's wicked funny, man.
[15627.77s -> 15656.47s]  What the hell are you shooting at? Wait. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Open the door!
[15666.18s -> 15706.70s]  What? It was destroyed? Make it to the time machine to set things right. Fluffy. Fuzzy.
[15707.26s -> 15718.98s]  There. Now I can't hurt anymore. What? Oh, I can't. Oh, right, right. Okay.
[15719.62s -> 15753.29s]  Actually, you can help me here. What? Like just like a cart? Sorry. Shrink ray? Shrink
[15753.29s -> 15787.72s]  ray and then suck it up with a vacuum. Doesn't work. That's not going to start this all over,
[15787.72s -> 15843.50s]  is it? I don't think I should do that. It already is a black hole. What? A heal? Healing potion.
[15844.30s -> 15876.25s]  A healing suspect. Immortal. How about that? Yeah. Unkillable. Invincible. Oh.
[15878.36s -> 15894.33s]  I don't think immortality works either. Sorry. This guy's still alive. How did I not kill this
[15894.33s -> 15908.98s]  guy? All right. He seems to be sitting around. Key's in the way. God damn it. That's going to
[15908.98s -> 15931.35s]  kill me. It's going to roll over and kill me. I need the key though. Use? Make a new key.
[15932.76s -> 15977.05s]  Okay. Shit. Come on. Really? No, it took it over. Come on. All right. Turn it off and spin it this
[15977.05s -> 16002.57s]  way. All right. We're good. Bye. Where am I? My head. Oh, please. Find a way outside. Oh my God.
[16002.57s -> 16035.46s]  Okay. I'm not. I got smaller. Tiny. Get it. Shrunk and tiny. Shrunk and tiny. Shrunk and.
[16036.02s -> 16050.89s]  I think that's good. Watch out for hazards. What do you mean watch out for hazards? Oh, up here.
[16074.12s -> 16109.75s]  Wait. What? Holy. Whatever. Oh, I could do this whole fucking thing again.
[16110.71s -> 16117.08s]  All right. The umbrella. The umbrella was fucking me up. Oh my God. All right. Box.
[16117.64s -> 16164.06s]  Sprinkler. Turn it on. No. Turn. Get it. I want to be able to match him in firepower. Let's
[16164.14s -> 16236.92s]  annihilate him. Box. Oh. Sprinkler. Check out the dump truck add-on. Yeah. I've already seen it.
[16236.92s -> 16244.65s]  Spray him with water. He's electric. There you go. Now what are you going to do?
[16245.29s -> 16260.70s]  All right. Well, he's going to eat whatever. He's going to be tortured forever. Oh no. The key.
[16283.78s -> 16315.56s]  Open the door. Good. Tiny. Shrunk and small. Minuscule. Ow. I scraped my skull. All right.
[16315.56s -> 16331.86s]  This time we're going to do this right. Uh. Wings. Here we go. Okay. I gotta have something.
[16331.86s -> 16357.22s]  Press that button. A big rod. Good. Let's go. Watch out for the lightning on this roof. Good.
[16357.22s -> 16361.64s]  Hey, get to the time machine. Watch out for the strong gusts. The spikes are dangerous.
[16362.36s -> 16399.82s]  Oh, are they? Oh, what? How did that happen? Wait. That's instantly. Holy shit. That sucks.
[16400.38s -> 16439.06s]  What? Why? I'm going to leave. You keep dying. I'm trying. Look, I'm trying my absolute hardest.
[16442.68s -> 16459.85s]  Those things are going to move. Okay. Just take his fucking gun. Oh my God. Please don't die.
[16459.85s -> 16492.95s]  Please don't die. Please don't die. What am I doing? Click on him. Give me that key. You're
[16492.95s -> 16535.26s]  fucking kidding me. Tiny. Tiny. Tiny. There we go. Every time. Every time. It doesn't matter.
[16535.26s -> 16565.21s]  Whatever. Oh, we're good. Okay. So I'm going to block it with a vent or something. I'm going
[16565.21s -> 16581.83s]  to cover that up. I'm going to put like a tarp on it. I don't know. Like a pool tarp. Boulder.
[16581.83s -> 16631.62s]  It looks like concrete. Can I just run through this? Just give me like a missile launcher and
[16631.62s -> 16666.18s]  I'm just running through. That's water in there. Okay. Let's relax for a second. Just a minute.
[16667.42s -> 16683.32s]  Just a second. What? What? Can I do this? At least I can do this. Okay. Good.
[16704.65s -> 16727.14s]  Soundproof. Brighten object. No, no, no. Go back. I can't walk down. I think I have to destroy this
[16727.14s -> 16754.57s]  stuff. Otherwise those don't fall. Put on heavy shoes. Would that work? Take his gun. Take his
[16754.57s -> 16775.21s]  gun. Take his gun. Take his gun. Have you watched the Daedalus Effect stream? I streamed the Daedalus
[16775.21s -> 16796.17s]  Effect stream. That was me. It was a deep fake. I don't want to fuck this up again. I got to get
[16796.17s -> 16848.38s]  out of this stupid prison again. Tiny and what else? Shockproof. All right. Let's go. I need a
[16848.38s -> 16861.50s]  balloon. I need wings. I'm going to give wings to you too. Come with me. We can do it together
[16862.14s -> 16871.69s]  and you can be sort of the, uh, the guy that goes first. One wing. All right. Come with me.
[16877.32s -> 16931.83s]  Follower. Friendly flying, flying friend. Let's go. Guardian. Just rope him. He's having fun.
[16938.84s -> 16942.52s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. This camera is horrible. I don't
[16942.52s -> 16947.82s]  know where it is. Hold on. Let go. Stop pulling me that way. Stop pulling me that way. Let go.
[16949.46s -> 16956.36s]  No, I took off my cool hat. No, I took off my cool stuff. No, I took off my cool nose. No,
[16956.36s -> 16993.46s]  I took off my cool wings. There. Okay. Here we go. So, uh, heavy, heavy pants. Why am I flying?
[16996.63s -> 17031.26s]  Heavy shoes are too small. Oh, uh, okay. It's not working. Get rid of the wing.
[17034.31s -> 17038.79s]  Holy shit. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea. What if I put just like a,
[17038.79s -> 17044.68s]  like a metal platform or something or like a, what if I just, I'm going to weigh myself down
[17044.68s -> 17086.15s]  with something. I don't know, like a piano. I just mini golfed off the piano into this bike.
[17086.15s -> 17121.61s]  Just make yourself heavy. I, wow. Metal wings. Make yourself really obese. Slow and obese.
[17121.61s -> 17142.78s]  Certain size increases. Uh, you see, I, you can't, you're not allowed. I know what it is.
[17143.51s -> 17153.82s]  Turn it on. What about an anvil? I mean, I, I put a whole house on there and it was blowing it up.
[17154.46s -> 17173.38s]  I think I just have to wait till it's not blowing and then go. Use a helmet? I don't think that's
[17173.38s -> 17196.87s]  going to do anything. Wait, how did you get that back? Make yourself really fast. I'm going to,
[17196.87s -> 17199.19s]  I'm going to do incredibly fat, incredibly heavy, incredibly fast.
[17200.15s -> 17203.83s]  Cover the spikes so I can't crash into him. It all, it all falls. It's physics.
[17224.89s -> 17282.95s]  Make an immovable object. What's more immovable than a house? This is jump king. It kind of is.
[17283.94s -> 17291.56s]  He's mad at this game. No, I'm not. Says who? I love this. Okay. I'm going to make an immovable,
[17293.37s -> 17332.63s]  an immovable, I'm going to make an immovable house. It's going past it. Holy shit. That scared me.
[17343.02s -> 17349.90s]  Oh, Pog. Champ. Pog. Champ. Pog. I should get that out of the way.
[17354.22s -> 17375.85s]  Time travel hasn't been destroyed yet. Grab it. I thought that was going to be way harder. Did it.
[17375.85s -> 17391.88s]  I did it. They're going on the roof streamers. You go to children's game. It's not a children's game.
[17391.88s -> 17405.37s]  It's an E for everyone game. That means everyone can enjoy it.
[17405.37s -> 17418.94s]  These watch towers don't come with a bathroom. Put a toilet in there? All right. Yeah. Did you
[17418.94s -> 17442.17s]  go in it? What about you? I'll bridge the gap between the princess and me. Easy. Black hole them
[17442.17s -> 17459.24s]  together. Easy. Why do they always jump off the roof? What's wrong with everybody? What is wrong
[17459.24s -> 17467.93s]  with everybody? All right. Let's keep going. I've been playing this for five hours. What the hell?
[17467.93s -> 17490.58s]  Where'd the time go? What about the pond? Alligator. I love alligators. I really got to go,
[17490.58s -> 17517.21s]  but it's really gross in there. Oh, he means in here. I'll just use it. All right. It's really
[17517.21s -> 17529.72s]  gross in there. Let's clean it. Um, mop. You all right. Oh, there we go. All right. He mopped it.
[17529.72s -> 17538.97s]  You can now play as Maxwell's brother Scratch. Don't think I want to. Oh, get these woodpeckers
[17538.97s -> 17578.50s]  away from me. Look what's over here. A nice tasty juicy worm. They don't eat worms? What do they eat?
[17578.50s -> 17603.29s]  That one held on for so long. I need to restart. That was horrible. Hillbilly. Uh, okay. You want
[17603.29s -> 17607.45s]  to abduct the- give us what we want and we'll leave you in peace. Okay. You definitely want
[17607.45s -> 17630.57s]  to abduct this guy. Let's make it easy. All right. Use the bridge. Why are you stupid? All right. What
[17630.57s -> 17675.02s]  does he like? How about this? How about, um, Hungry Hillbilly? Get him. Suck him up. Oh, Jesus Christ.
[17682.54s -> 17710.26s]  Help Maxwell find aliens. The aliens walk among us in disguise. The first alien is afraid of
[17710.26s -> 17749.96s]  bright lights. Flashlight. Flood light. Uh, fluorescent light. Twilight light? Twilight
[17749.96s -> 17778.90s]  fluorescent twilight? Okay. I don't think- bright light. You don't like bright lights. What about
[17778.90s -> 17804.12s]  the sun? That's very bright. Got him. Afraid of loud noises. This guy? Okay. Loud noises. Symbols.
[17804.68s -> 17821.69s]  Let's smash them together. There you go. Foster. Terrified of- what did it say? Water? Terrified of
[17821.69s -> 17852.18s]  water. You don't want it? You're not even a real cat. Blow you off with a fan. Now what? Now what?
[17852.18s -> 17884.74s]  Afraid of heights. It's you. It's- I think it's her. It's me. Fungi? No, trampoline, right?
[17884.74s -> 17910.50s]  Could launch him up in the air. What did I think was gonna happen? Like, really? What did I honestly
[17910.50s -> 17936.01s]  think was gonna happen? All right. Let's make this quick. I'm trying to get it on her. Whatever. It's
[17936.01s -> 17963.53s]  here for you whenever you want it. Okay. Light. Sound. Butter. Nuke. Th- but I- I need to complete
[17963.53s -> 17996.70s]  this. What? Did my shirt- did my shirt get caught on the edge of the- did my shirt get caught on
[17996.70s -> 18009.88s]  the edge of the cabinet and like fucking just snap my neck? What the f- The sun with the trampoline?
[18009.88s -> 18019.10s]  What- why- the sun's not killing us when it's down here? Okay, so you're telling me that the sun being
[18019.10s -> 18029.32s]  10 feet away from us is okay, but if I touch the sun, I instantly die. We'll get the hell out of
[18029.32s -> 18082.49s]  here then. Oh my god. Okay. Loud sounds. Jesus. I did it! Oh, I can't believe I died from the sun.
[18082.49s -> 18092.14s]  Didn't use nuke, didn't you? No, I'm not gonna use a nuke. Oh, barbecue? Play something to grill on
[18092.14s -> 18106.73s]  the barbie. Oh, yes. Um, I'll take the wings off. Uh, okay. What do I need to cook? How about a shish kebab?
[18114.38s -> 18139.98s]  Yes! I haven't had a bite in weeks. Well, look what I got for you. It's a shish kebab. What are you
[18139.98s -> 18148.74s]  doing? What the fuck are you doing, man? Why are you so mad at me? You don't want a shish kebab?
[18155.40s -> 18175.48s]  Raw chicken. He's so mad at this frog. He's pissed. He eats- he just ate me. Don't eat the frog!
[18177.08s -> 18235.88s]  Um, all right. I don't know. We'll just, like, person. Blowing toxic alligator. I need somebody
[18235.88s -> 18252.57s]  to kiss. A princess? Oh, I don't know. Can the princess kiss the frog and it turns into a prince?
[18252.57s -> 18286.95s]  Prince frog. Oh, I need to feed this alligator. What about just a chicken? Just the bird. A chicken.
[18287.51s -> 18336.78s]  Not into it. What's his problem? He's not even aggressive anymore. Oh, maybe it's because I
[18336.78s -> 18343.58s]  dropped a nuke on him. Okay. Oh, everything is softlocked because of the nuke. Well, these guys
[18343.58s -> 18352.38s]  are all right. These guys didn't get affected. I want to be a duckling. Okay, how about a duck-like
[18352.38s -> 18372.95s]  turtle? Duckie turtle. Oh, fuck it. Whatever. The place is- I nuked it. What about ruins of ellipsis?
[18373.99s -> 18399.62s]  Duckie is my favorite. Oh, shit. I still have radioactivity on me. Clean. I'll be glowing still.
[18399.62s -> 18414.25s]  That's fine. Clean. Lowing. Clean. Clean. There. Okay. This carnivorous plant may hold the cure
[18414.25s -> 18429.42s]  for many diseases, but I can't get it to bloom. Blood. Right? There. Hungry. It's a hungry
[18429.42s -> 18442.30s]  carnivorous plant. We need to put, um, like, fertilizer? Pick it up. Fertilize it. Not what
[18442.30s -> 18459.14s]  I had in mind. Bugs in there. Ant. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it under control. I got it.
[18472.06s -> 18499.29s]  Huge anthill. Our leader has died. Create a new leader suitable for us. Oh, sure. What's he eating?
[18506.74s -> 18515.24s]  Our leader's died. Create a new leader. Um, the huge, cosmic, obese, kingly ant is not queen. Oh,
[18515.24s -> 18542.12s]  you're right. That's true. Queenly, obese, cosmic, huge, ant leader. Laser. How fit your party of
[18542.12s -> 18550.17s]  brave adventurers for a legendary journey? Wait. What about the bird with the hair? Uh, no. What about
[18550.17s -> 18558.26s]  you? I'm so plain. Add an adjective to me so I can fit in. Here we have hair. Green. Parakeet
[18558.26s -> 18596.09s]  tropical. Okay. I didn't do anything. You just put barbecue sauce on me. Oh, right. Right. Right.
[18596.09s -> 18601.74s]  Sorry, man. Man, sorry about that, man. Hold on, man. I got you. Hold on, sir. Sorry about that,
[18601.74s -> 18606.31s]  my friend. I'll take care of that. Just really quick. Hold on. I'm gonna just take care of that
[18606.31s -> 18614.63s]  real quick. Uh, let's have a cheesy, man. Cheesy, man. Hey, cheese. No, no, no. That one's dumb,
[18614.63s -> 18622.12s]  too. I don't want that one. That one's stupid, too. Uh, how about gravity bird?
[18628.74s -> 18652.74s]  Gravely bird. It's just going up there and it's gonna go directly into this bird's nostrils and
[18652.74s -> 18683.62s]  puke is gonna go over on this side of the screen. How about a lovely bird? Hey. Wait, he's like,
[18683.62s -> 18697.75s]  you made me ugly. Just give me something to help me study these chimps. There, a video camera.
[18697.75s -> 18716.42s]  Crystal huge rib cage. Oh, wait, he's kicking his... Oh, no. If I'm ugly, then no one can be pretty.
[18719.14s -> 18769.42s]  Only him, though. Why? Oh, I can't give him the slingshot. The ultimate. The ultimate. Not even
[18769.42s -> 18794.55s]  real anymore. VR? Mango tree. Still missing something. Oh, down here. Well, sorry to hear
[18794.55s -> 18814.62s]  that. How about this one? Outfit the party. Prepare the adventurers for an epic quest. Provide the
[18814.62s -> 18877.24s]  warrior with a weapon. So good. Heat ray. Uh, a spare cannon. Cannon. I thought that was gonna
[18877.24s -> 18901.80s]  rock his head back. There. A whip. What about you? A weapon he can use from a distance. Maybe a bow
[18901.80s -> 18911.64s]  and arrow? No. No way. This magician wants to do something magical. A weapon that channels
[18911.64s -> 18923.37s]  magical ability. The cleric's role is to support the team. Give her something to heal the party
[18923.37s -> 18992.44s]  members. No? That's disgusting. Fine, here you go. Nice. Nice shooting. Nice microphoneing.
[18992.44s -> 19009.05s]  Is there something I could have done there to stop them? Oh, no. She's gonna revive. Did I give them
[19009.05s -> 19027.69s]  these? Oh, cool. Very cool. Very nice. Uh-huh. You know, I was the manager of the team, so
[19028.33s -> 19043.77s]  I think I deserve a couple of these. Yeah. Four gem... Four gold coins dropped. I'm gonna take
[19044.41s -> 19048.73s]  four and a half, and you're gonna split the other half evenly between the four of you,
[19051.67s -> 19055.69s]  and then you're gonna get ready, and you're gonna fucking go on another adventure, and we're gonna
[19055.69s -> 19081.32s]  do it all over again. I'm an asshole. You get one fourth of one coin. I'll be taking that one.
[19081.32s -> 19091.06s]  He said communist? When did I say that? I just said I told you to go in there, and then I took
[19091.06s -> 19106.66s]  four and a half coins. Help me find the crystal bones of... I know where they are. I know where
[19106.66s -> 19134.89s]  they are. Capitalist, not communist. Oh. I'm so glad that didn't hit me right in the fucking head.
[19135.45s -> 19167.19s]  All right, here we go. I got you juicy baby back ribs. There's more? Oh.
[19167.91s -> 19192.18s]  Found one. Put this dude back together again. Take it. Capitalist in chat. Guys, I've told you
[19192.18s -> 19198.55s]  about how much money I lost on Beyond Meat. Is that something that you would hear from a communist?
[19206.36s -> 19223.50s]  Break this down. I saved the bunny. Okay, now we need to... He's a fake communist. What does
[19223.50s -> 19233.80s]  that even mean? Investing in fake meat. No, I told the story already. I was like, the things valued
[19233.80s -> 19240.28s]  at like five times Microsoft. There's no fucking way. Absolutely not a chance in hell that this
[19240.28s -> 19249.61s]  stays at this insane price. No fucking way. And it did. And it went higher. Way higher.
[19249.61s -> 19278.23s]  I was like, well, this is stupid. But these are the bones. Oh, up here. I have to dismount.
[19278.23s -> 19283.51s]  You scared? Oh, you were scared that whole time? What is it? Are you okay? Are you all right?
[19283.99s -> 19288.33s]  Take off like the... Take off the glasses. Take off the... Hey, it's okay.
[19290.17s -> 19306.20s]  It's all right. I need wings. Yeah, this is also... This is like two or three years ago.
[19319.75s -> 19332.82s]  Help him. I'll help him, don't worry. There's more bones. Are you kidding me?
[19334.89s -> 19341.26s]  Oh, no, there's not. All right, there we go. I did it. That's it. Oh, there's one more thing
[19341.26s -> 19352.50s]  that I didn't do. Remember, went to biz, made a bunch of awful investments and never looked back.
[19355.96s -> 19375.72s]  And though that didn't happen, I did. Look, we have to understand. Oh, and by the way,
[19375.72s -> 19381.48s]  by the way, all of the haters and all the people that were making fun of the crypto stuff. Oh,
[19381.48s -> 19389.56s]  he's got an Ethereum account. He's got BTC. It's dead. Have you looked at it today? Did you look
[19389.56s -> 19401.40s]  at it yesterday? Well, isn't that interesting? It's almost back to all time high. I was told
[19402.20s -> 19416.47s]  that it was dead in the water. And look at me now. I sold it at like a 60% loss because I was
[19416.47s -> 19421.48s]  terrified. Because after it went down to like $3,000, I was like, all right, well, it's gone. I'm
[19421.48s -> 19431.24s]  going to sell. But that doesn't exclude the principle that I knew it was going to be a thing.
[19431.24s -> 19435.88s]  I knew it was going to happen, but I needed some of that cash. I needed a cash flow at that moment.
[19437.16s -> 19439.96s]  I didn't want to sell them, but I needed the cash because that was when I was moving here.
[19439.96s -> 19444.44s]  I was moving to Vegas and I was like, you know, I could use, I could use, I could use like a few
[19444.44s -> 19478.23s]  thousand dollars right now. Don't worry. Cause I made it all back with this last run. What are
[19478.23s -> 19485.14s]  you talking about? Oh, this person has no idea. Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, BTC. Like three years
[19485.14s -> 19489.80s]  ago, I talked about how I was like really into it and I was getting involved. It may not have
[19489.80s -> 19498.78s]  been around for like three or three years ago, like four years ago almost. Let's go to new zone.
[19505.46s -> 19512.42s]  All right. I will, let's do one more. I want to go to pirate code. Bitcoin's not even a currency.
[19514.54s -> 19520.54s]  Well, you, I can't think of something worse to say to like an internet group of technologically
[19521.10s -> 19525.78s]  sound individuals. And then what you just said out loud, there's a bunch of people here probably
[19525.78s -> 19529.30s]  that that's like just, you essentially just told everybody, like all of your politics,
[19529.30s -> 19532.66s]  how you believe in everything. And then you just started, that's a war. You just started
[19532.66s -> 19571.19s]  like a chat war. I need a tool from my trade to finally settle this argument. New, what's going
[19571.19s -> 19589.85s]  on down here? Something terrible has happened to the crew. Help break the curse. Crew has become
[19589.85s -> 19597.03s]  cursed. Give each crew, Otto. What are you doing, Otto? Hold on. Uh, let me get, I gotta go pee too.
[19597.03s -> 19605.14s]  Let me get Otto and go pee. I think he wants to come in. You want to come in? All right. One
[19605.14s -> 19773.69s]  sec. Slugs outdated. Dupe overrated. Long have I waited. Otto has invaded. Hi, Otto. He has invaded
[19773.69s -> 19791.82s]  actually. He's in the room right now, sleeping on his bed. Uh, there we go. Show Otto for minus
[19791.82s -> 19803.40s]  a hundred million off the dead, right? Uh, I hope the webcam's not even like plugged in.
[19803.96s -> 19809.82s]  I plugged in my controller for yesterday. It's a deal. Oh, shit. Hold on. Let me think about that.
[19814.79s -> 19827.99s]  Give the warrior of our group a medieval weapon. Attilax. Okay. Give. First curse has been broken.
[19827.99s -> 19835.46s]  The next crew member loved his facial hair, but now he's almost bald. Okay. Beard. Long beard.
[19863.67s -> 19874.79s]  Uh, I guess regular beard. Okay. What? Tick tock. Tick tock. Deal's running out. All right. All
[19874.79s -> 19881.70s]  right. A hundred million. A hundred million, right? 100 million off the dead. Let's go.
[19882.26s -> 19891.72s]  Oh, my webcam is plugged in. He lied about that. I didn't. Yes, he did. I may have. Watch out.
[19924.92s -> 19937.74s]  Show him now. I am. My webcam's like, this is, this webcam was last used on Halloween.
[19939.54s -> 19953.18s]  Set up for all the Halloween settings. Turn off auto. This looks like shit. Why does this look so
[19953.18s -> 19970.01s]  terrible? This, this looks like a video game. Whatever. I, I've looked like I'm, I'm, that's
[19970.01s -> 19995.38s]  sepia toned. There is no Otto. There is Otto. Hold on. There is Otto. Scam. No, I'm just like
[19995.38s -> 19999.06s]  getting him in the right spot. I don't, I don't want to like just rip him up here. He's fragile.
[19999.06s -> 20031.08s]  You don't want to just like, oh, here's my dog. Okay. Come here. I'm, no, I'm not, this is not
[20031.08s -> 20064.79s]  the dog yet. Hold on. That's a hundred million, by the way. That's a hundred million, by the way.
[20065.59s -> 20078.78s]  He's my special boy. Favorite thing in the, favorite person in the world. And yes, he is a
[20078.78s -> 20092.22s]  person. He's my little person. The camera sucks in a really shitty place. Let's just, just pretend
[20092.22s -> 20108.42s]  I was out here this whole time. Yes. Hey, haircut. Delayed. Oh, why was it delayed? That's weird.
[20113.05s -> 20131.21s]  Shave that hundred million off, please. All right. Let's finish this up. What's the next task? The
[20131.21s -> 20143.66s]  Wisp needs a mirror. Mirror. Mirror for the Wisp. The synced footage does not count. Yes, it does.
[20146.78s -> 20160.76s]  Teach the brainless crew member. Professor. He's so scared. What about Polly? Where you unite me with
[20160.76s -> 20179.93s]  Polly? Tarakete. There he is. The synced footage is 50% what it's worth. What are you talking about,
[20179.93s -> 20193.06s]  man? That is not true. That's unbelievable. That was not in the contract. That was not in the verbal
[20193.06s -> 20198.10s]  contract. It was just show Otto on cam. It didn't say it had to be the right sync. It didn't say it
[20198.10s -> 20202.02s]  had to have the right audio settings. It was just show Otto on cam. That's a hundred million shaved
[20202.02s -> 20204.82s]  off the debt. Thank you very much. I'll take the hundred million shaved off the debt, please.
[20216.73s -> 20223.27s]  Oh, this is due to the final areas. 75. No, a hundred million. That's what we agreed on.
[20234.49s -> 20241.86s]  Come to the final areas. Speaking of Otto, I actually need to feed him. That's why he came
[20241.86s -> 20249.67s]  over here in the first place. And it's been about six hours. I think it's time for me to go.
[20255.61s -> 20264.66s]  I also need to feed myself too. Feed Otto on stream. No, no, I'm not bringing all his food
[20264.66s -> 20275.94s]  up here. Enable Link's tiny man? Did you guys abuse it? Yeah, that's why he was like barking
[20275.94s -> 20286.15s]  at the door. He's like, excuse me. Like, it's time, man. Get down here and feed me. That's a
[20286.15s -> 20297.18s]  good place to stop. That was a lot of fun. Maybe I'll keep this in the bag for random days. It's
[20297.18s -> 20308.92s]  pretty fun. It was just fun to chill and do this. A billion if I show Otto feeding him on stream?
[20311.05s -> 20323.88s]  No way. One billion. That's a major amount. We're seeing that. We're seeing that's a deal.
[20324.52s -> 20339.21s]  Okay. Do I have to do it right now or can I open the next stream with that? Instead of my starting
[20339.21s -> 20344.87s]  soon screen, I will have a camera set up for it. Otto is eating stream starting soon screen.
[20344.87s -> 20359.48s]  You know what words I was just trying to say. It's now or never. No, I'll do it now. I'm fucking
[20359.48s -> 20373.21s]  dying to see him. I'll do more Otto content, I promise. Let's delay him so he can't feed. No,
[20373.21s -> 20385.06s]  what are you crazy? There is no delay. It's over. I'll see you guys on, let's see, Tuesday?
[20385.94s -> 20394.78s]  Tuesday or Thursday? Tuesday or Wednesday? Probably Wednesday. Yeah, we'll go Wednesday,
[20394.78s -> 20408.68s]  Thursday, Friday. We'll go at least Wednesday, Thursday, Friday in this coming week. I have
[20409.64s -> 20415.72s]  things to do. I have some decisions to make. I have to talk to my doctor. I told you earlier.
[20416.44s -> 20424.04s]  Some of you may have not been around, but I have to start setting up some of these procedures.
[20424.76s -> 20431.86s]  I'm going to get trigger point injections into my back. I've had injections before in my butt.
[20435.32s -> 20439.24s]  It did a little bit. It didn't do a whole lot, but they're actually going to do it into the
[20439.24s -> 20447.45s]  trigger points this time. For those of you that don't know, I've had this lingering annoying
[20447.45s -> 20452.87s]  medical problem for the last couple of years. I'm back in chest hurt all the time. It never
[20452.87s -> 20460.33s]  goes away. It never gets any worse. I get tight sometimes if I sit down or stand for too long.
[20460.33s -> 20466.46s]  But the solution, I've been through the absolute wringer when it comes to exams and procedures and
[20466.46s -> 20474.63s]  everything. I have two discs in my spine that are dark, which is signaling some type of,
[20475.27s -> 20484.34s]  at least mild start of degeneration. I also have a hernia in my esophagus,
[20484.34s -> 20489.86s]  hiatal hernia. Not that big, but it may be causing some of the chest problems. They think I might
[20489.86s -> 20497.06s]  just be getting combo'd. I'm going to do trigger point injections. My back muscles are always
[20497.06s -> 20500.42s]  painful, so we're going to see if that works. If that helps, then I might not have to do very
[20500.42s -> 20510.31s]  much else. Yeah, the part where your esophagus connects to your stomach. That's where my hernia
[20510.31s -> 20518.74s]  is called the hiatal hernia. Dad had something similar. The injections helped. I hope so,
[20518.74s -> 20524.81s]  because honestly, it's the back that's... I could deal with that upper kind of abdominal,
[20525.45s -> 20533.35s]  mid, center of my chest pain. It's not that big of a deal. But man, the spine and back pain.
[20537.40s -> 20545.80s]  It's debilitating sometimes, I'll be honest. Sometimes it'll get so tight that it kind of
[20545.80s -> 20552.78s]  drives you crazy, right? Especially if I do a lot of activity. And that's why, I remember after the
[20552.78s -> 20563.27s]  green screen stream, I did a lot of activity and then turned into dog shit. So the idea is to go
[20563.27s -> 20568.62s]  get these injections, go get the trigger point injections, and go manage kind of that spinal
[20568.62s -> 20578.81s]  problem. And that won't happen anymore. I can kind of live my life normally without having this just
[20578.81s -> 20585.69s]  constant sort of tight, just aggravating pain right through the center of my back into my chest.
[20585.69s -> 20593.82s]  But I'm good now. A lot of people saying, take care of yourself. Do what you need to do.
[20593.82s -> 20601.46s]  I already have. Guys, I used to stream for like seven to eight hours every time I turned the stream
[20601.46s -> 20606.82s]  on. I would say I would at least be here for six to eight hours, seven to nine hours sometimes.
[20606.82s -> 20620.30s]  I don't do that anymore. I just don't. So I've already made those changes. 12 hour Simpson stream.
[20620.30s -> 20629.10s]  Sometimes they go longer than that. But this kind of every two or three hours, get up and take a
[20629.10s -> 20636.54s]  break, stretch, get some water, come back. Five, six hours goes by and it's like, all right, I'm
[20636.54s -> 20642.20s]  gonna get up. So it's been working pretty well, I think. Because I can tell you right now,
[20642.20s -> 20651.86s]  absolutely sitting for another two hours would not be good. It would be very bad. So sometimes
[20651.86s -> 20656.60s]  I am going to cross that length though, right? Like seven hours, maybe like seven and a half.
[20656.60s -> 20663.21s]  I think I've streamed for like seven hours yesterday or something, right? Sometimes it's
[20663.21s -> 20672.55s]  going to happen, but it's not going to be the norm anymore. But that was very, very stalling.
[20672.55s -> 20679.86s]  He's stalling to end the stream, right? I am. But for a lot, some people might not know that that's
[20679.86s -> 20685.98s]  kind of going on. There's a lot of new people here over the last couple of years, especially
[20685.98s -> 20691.96s]  the last six months. So some of you newer viewers that may have just kind of started watching over
[20691.96s -> 20697.82s]  the last year. I'm not sure if you've known some of you do, some of you don't. So I'll talk about
[20697.82s -> 20703.05s]  it sometimes just to keep everybody up to date. But that's going to be it. I'll see you guys on
[20703.05s -> 20709.32s]  Wednesday. Thanks for all the subs, everybody. And there was some huge donations too. Thank you guys,
[20709.32s -> 20719.35s]  seriously. Next week will be interesting because there's a lot of highly recommended games that
[20719.35s -> 20730.18s]  are probably going to happen. Probably going to play Sly Cooper. People have been waiting for
[20730.18s -> 20746.39s]  that one. I'm playing the PS3 remastered one. That's okay, right? They didn't mess it up somehow
[20746.39s -> 20757.38s]  in the remaster? Good. Okay. Thanksgiving family guy joke incoming. Well, no, I'm not even going
[20757.38s -> 20762.28s]  to say anything because the reason why I was like two or three minutes late, I was here. I was here
[20762.28s -> 20767.59s]  for like an hour or two before the stream. I was on the phone. I was in a call with my manager
[20768.07s -> 20778.73s]  to talk about a very specific stream that we're starting to work on right now. That's why I was
[20778.73s -> 20788.41s]  just like, I got to fucking go. I got to call my manager. Baseball. Baseball already is happening
[20788.41s -> 20806.82s]  in 2021. I have talked to my manager about so many projects over the 2020 that couldn't happen in
[20806.82s -> 20814.31s]  2020 that we wanted to do in 2020. So obviously because of COVID. So once COVID is under control,
[20816.23s -> 20820.15s]  there's so many things that are just back to back to back to back to back that I've already
[20820.15s -> 20827.59s]  either done or almost done. That 2021 should be ridiculous in regards to streams that I've
[20827.59s -> 20835.24s]  wanted to do for a long time. It's never going to happen. I want you to remember that because
[20836.31s -> 20841.90s]  just like the carnival, some of these things that I decide I want to do, I'm doing them no matter
[20841.90s -> 20852.25s]  what. The one that I'm talking about is happening no matter what. It's going to happen.
[20852.25s -> 20859.88s]  Baseball especially. But when? I'll tell you when it happens. I'll let you know beforehand. Don't
[20859.88s -> 20866.28s]  worry. What if society collapses? It's not. Look, I'm going to do these streams. The sides are not
[20866.28s -> 20873.38s]  going to collapse. All right. I have to feed Otto. All right. Yeah. People are like, go, go, go.
[20873.38s -> 20877.03s]  All right. I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Take care of yourselves. Have a great rest of the night.
[20877.03s -> 20881.99s]  Goodbye. Take care. Thanks for watching. That was Scribble Nuts with Jirba985.
[20882.47s -> 20933.21s]  Oh god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Hold on. End of the stream. End of the stream chat picks the next
[20933.21s -> 20942.38s]  stream. We did. That did happen. I did say that. Right. Okay. What is it? You guys stuck around for
[20942.38s -> 20948.39s]  a long time. People like left. All right. What's going on on the next stream? You want to get a
[20948.39s -> 20957.14s]  little poll going? Okay. Let's do it. I was getting up to walk out of the room. All right. Here comes
[20957.14s -> 20976.14s]  the poll. All right. Seeing a signal simulator. I'm not going to play TF2. That's vetoed. No TF2.
[20976.14s -> 20988.60s]  I don't know. No TF2. All right. Signal Sim Sly Cooper. Let's get this right. This is for the next
[20988.60s -> 20993.64s]  time I turn the stream on, by the way. You have the power here. Signal Sim Sly Cooper.
[20999.08s -> 21006.78s]  Six grueling hours of Scribblenauts for this moment. Sometimes I feel like I have you guys
[21006.78s -> 21019.00s]  tied down to like an electrifying chair. I just saw. Okay. I saw Yakuza. What? Which one?
[21019.64s -> 21031.62s]  I played Yakuza 0 for like a few hours. I already played. You want me to go back to Yakuza 0
[21032.18s -> 21048.84s]  or the new one? Go back. Yes. Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back. I'm begging you for Nancy Drew.
[21048.84s -> 21053.30s]  Fine. It's going on the list. All right. I'm going to. I'm just going to write like Yakuza?
[21053.78s -> 21060.82s]  Question mark. Yakuza. What? The guy was begging me for what? Oh yeah. Nancy Drew.
[21063.14s -> 21076.17s]  Or let's say a house flipper DLC. All right. We have a lot of categories here. We have a lot of
[21076.17s -> 21089.40s]  nominees here. Not Doki Doki. You had your only chance to pick Doki Doki. And you guys didn't
[21089.40s -> 21094.63s]  pick it. You dropped the ball on it. Slime Rancher. Okay. Slime Rancher is going on here.
[21098.28s -> 21100.60s]  All right. Okay. All right. All right. This is, this is enough. This is enough.
[21101.16s -> 21104.76s]  We got one, two, three, four, five, six. By the way, we're not doing,
[21104.76s -> 21109.30s]  we're not doing any elimination. No. Okay. We'll do one. Okay. We'll do two elimination rounds.
[21109.30s -> 21123.91s]  One, two, three, four, five, six. Two elimination rounds. Here's the first poll. Go for it. Let's
[21123.91s -> 21141.10s]  see. Right off the bat we have. Okay. I can't say any words. I can't mention anything. If I mention
[21141.10s -> 21149.88s]  any of these, they will instantly get a hundred votes. Even if I say that this X game is dog shit,
[21149.88s -> 21160.22s]  it'll be clicked a hundred times. All right. Okay. We have some eliminations we're going to do.
[21160.22s -> 21165.72s]  We're going to eliminate two things per round, by the way. That's how this works. The lowest two
[21166.52s -> 21179.94s]  based on vote, not on percentage on vote count are gone. All right. I'm closing the first round
[21179.94s -> 21189.70s]  in five, in 10 seconds. 10 seconds. Closing the poll. 10 seconds. 10, nine, eight, seven, six,
[21190.74s -> 21199.86s]  nine, four, three, two, one. There we are. That's it. What's lowest? Slime Rancher and
[21200.66s -> 21207.75s]  Signal Sim. No, no, no, no, no. Slime Rancher and Yakuza? No, Slime Rancher and,
[21208.95s -> 21215.19s]  there's still so many votes coming in. There's so many votes coming in. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait,
[21215.19s -> 21221.48s]  wait, wait. I don't have to take a screenshot. All right. Here we go. I'm going to take a
[21221.48s -> 21235.11s]  screenshot in 10 seconds. All right. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
[21235.11s -> 21251.32s]  That's it. Screenshot. That's it. What do we got? Okay. When I said that, here it is.
[21253.13s -> 21261.83s]  The two that are getting eliminated are Slime Rancher and Signal Simulator. Those are eliminated
[21261.83s -> 21273.34s]  from the running of next stream. The second round is coming in. Give me a second. Round two. Another
[21273.34s -> 21281.91s]  two will be eliminated this round. So we still have Sly Cooper still on there. We still have
[21281.91s -> 21292.31s]  Yakuza, which whatever one, which I will decide. We still have Nancy Drew. Why the fuck is this
[21292.31s -> 21305.14s]  still on here? How did this get more than 10 votes? And House Flipper DLC. Okay. Yakuza, Sly Cooper,
[21305.14s -> 21310.62s]  Nancy Drew, or House Flipper DLC. Here we go. Same deal. I'm going to take a screenshot.
[21322.57s -> 21339.99s]  Ooh. Ooh. Right off the bat doesn't look good. Doesn't look good. This is going to be tight
[21339.99s -> 21344.68s]  because, I mean, one of those, we've got almost a tie between two of them at least.
[21355.59s -> 21361.80s]  Okay. I mean, it's getting to be a little more clear. I'm going to do this one more time and
[21361.80s -> 21380.73s]  then count to 10 and take a screenshot. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That's it. It's done.
[21382.66s -> 21392.74s]  Uh, Nancy Drew and Sly Cooper have been eliminated. It is now down to Yakuza or House Flipper DLC.
[21393.38s -> 21426.50s]  Here we go. Final round. House Flipper DLC or Yakuza. Yakuza something. Here it comes. I feel like
[21426.50s -> 21434.97s]  this is going to be very, very, very close. It's going to be extraordinarily close because you've
[21434.97s -> 21439.05s]  got the House Flipper enthusiast that, oh, House Flipper, of course. I love that game. You love
[21439.05s -> 21443.21s]  that game. But then you got the contrarians that are saying, I don't want, no more House Flipper.
[21443.21s -> 21446.97s]  Like we haven't seen Yakuza. Like give us something different, right? Like you've played
[21446.97s -> 21452.47s]  House Flipper a thousand times. Let's play something else. It looks like it's going to be
[21452.47s -> 21482.68s]  very close or not. Nevermind. This is almost ready to call now. Somebody just wrote, I'm not
[21482.68s -> 21490.92s]  going to that stream. Come on, dude. We're trying to be democratic about it. I'm trying to be
[21490.92s -> 21500.63s]  democratic about this. I ain't going to that one. We'll go to the next one. Sly Cooper is going to
[21500.63s -> 21507.86s]  be like after that. I'm giving this 10. Do I even need to give 10 seconds? It's going to take a
[21507.86s -> 21523.51s]  Christmas miracle for Yakuza to pull this off. Down by more, almost 200 votes. That's it. That's
[21523.51s -> 21534.42s]  it. I will be playing the House Flipper DLC on Wednesday. And then on Thursday, I will be playing
[21534.42s -> 21544.52s]  Sly Cooper PlayStation 3 Remastered. And then on Friday, hey, hey guys, want to see how democracy
[21544.52s -> 21560.98s]  works on this channel? Playing Yakuza on Friday. There's your schedule for the week. I'm not going
[21560.98s -> 21569.51s]  to that one. Well, then there's no pleasing you. I'm not going to that one. I'm not going to that
[21569.51s -> 21575.11s]  one. I'm not going to that one. I wanted Slime Rancher. Well, I'll play Slime Rancher eventually.
[21575.11s -> 21590.38s]  Come on, Gwyn. It was Nancy Drew that I wanted. Well, I wanted Neopets. Okay. Listen. You want
[21590.38s -> 21597.14s]  me to play Neopets so bad, but you know that stream is going to be me. Just like, I'm going to buy a
[21597.14s -> 21602.42s]  Neopet and it's going to, I'm going to like feed it like three times. I'm going to throw a ball at
[21602.42s -> 21609.54s]  it. And then all of you, all of you Neopets enthusiasts are going to tell me, ah, can we do
[21609.54s -> 21613.30s]  something else? This sucks. We're just looking at a website the whole time. This is boring.
[21614.10s -> 21620.79s]  Jerma, this stream sucks. And I'm going to be like, steam is going to come out of my ears.
[21621.75s -> 21641.72s]  That's exactly what we want. All right. I'll see you for House Flipper on Wednesday. And then
[21641.80s -> 21646.18s]  well, I'll play Yakuza as well this coming week. All right. Now I actually have to leave now
[21646.18s -> 21650.18s]  because Otto is like staring at me like, dude, what the fuck are you doing? You're just talking.
[21650.18s -> 21654.98s]  You're just talking into this bright screen. Animals must think we're insane, by the way.
[21654.98s -> 21663.34s]  Think about that. We sit in front of this bright screen that just makes loud noises at us.
[21663.34s -> 21670.42s]  What the hell? Why are they, what are they doing? All right. I'll see you guys Wednesday. I gotta go.
[21670.98s -> 21673.86s]  Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Have a great rest of your weekend.
[21673.86s -> 21677.98s]  Still one with Sunday left, right? Take care, guys. See you soon.
