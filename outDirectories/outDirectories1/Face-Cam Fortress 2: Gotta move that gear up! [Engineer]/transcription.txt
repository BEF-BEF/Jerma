[0.31s -> 20.42s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, playing on Gullywash with the Frontier Justice, the Mini Sentry, and the Pistol.
[20.42s -> 26.39s]  The D-whoa! Hi Heavy! I can't believe you didn't kill me.
[26.39s -> 33.39s]  Gullywash is a map that I don't normally play on, and it's not because I don't like the map, it's because you don't really see it in the server browser too often.
[33.39s -> 40.02s]  But it's a five control point map, it's pretty interesting, and we are getting pretty much rolled right now.
[40.02s -> 51.16s]  Oh, get planted! Get pla-what? How did I-come here! Get over here! Oh! Give me that! Yeah! Yeah!
[51.16s -> 66.65s]  Oh, I was so pumped up right there, I almost just got like, aww, is this milk? It's milk! It's not Dr. Papa. What magician put that in front of me?
[66.65s -> 77.63s]  Milk is good though, I suggest you drink it. If you do not drink milk, does the body good? It's good to have every so often. I drink it usually once a day, maybe give or take.
[77.63s -> 83.63s]  Why am I not putting down-I should have put down my own stuff right there. I'm sitting there waiting for a teleporter and I'm an engineer.
[83.63s -> 89.88s]  Let's go for some more punches. Get that thing out of here!
[89.88s -> 103.45s]  Getting kills, getting kills, getting kills. Come on. Give me some more kills. Nice. Mini Sentry for the win, hell yeah. Hell freaking yeah.
[103.45s -> 110.84s]  That means if it dies, I'm gonna get the mini-I thought the mini-I almost said mini crits. Full crits, baby. What are you talking about, Jerma?
[110.84s -> 119.54s]  I still didn't put-I'm putting Dispenser in here. Forget that. Dispenser is going up in this room.
[119.54s -> 126.02s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Let's see what's out here.
[126.02s -> 135.98s]  We're still pushed back here? We're gonna move up. No, no, you good? Now I'm gonna do it. Here we go, baby. Let's plant it on some more people. Get some-oh!
[138.50s -> 152.75s]  Come on, come out here, Pyro. Come here. Come here, you. Come here, you. I didn't kill that guy. Bananas. Oh, that guy's got crits!
[152.75s -> 156.89s]  And a Pyro! Noooo!
[156.89s -> 169.72s]  Damn it. All right, I'm gonna build that guy's-oh, I am so stupid. I've had an opportunity to build that guy's teleporter up and I haven't done it yet.
[169.72s -> 179.46s]  I need to drink some more milk. Milk, milk, milk, milk. All right, here you go.
[179.46s -> 186.60s]  Now that it's there, it has level three. I'm gonna build one, too. Don't worry. So we're gonna have two there.
[186.60s -> 196.58s]  Jerma, being a bad engineer. Let's just go. Gotta get out the front lines. They are going to cap this, or are they?
[196.58s -> 206.79s]  Good, I'll take that. I'll take that. Get mine up here so we can get more people at the front lines, baby.
[206.79s -> 213.00s]  What the hell is going on? What? What just happened?
[213.00s -> 217.56s]  Scare. Nice, like, scary ghost heavy jumping around the corner.
[217.56s -> 224.62s]  Damn. I gotta put my game face on here, guys, because they're gonna cap this right now, probably.
[224.62s -> 231.15s]  Get your game face on. Or build up at the last point because they're coming in.
[231.15s -> 237.54s]  No, Pyro's gonna cap it if we're not careful. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? You son of a bitch.
[237.54s -> 249.83s]  Oh my god, it's the same heavy! Dude, that heavy has popped around a corner and, like, boo, scared me and killed me, like, three times in a row now.
[249.83s -> 252.83s]  And that's gonna be it! Somebody get on the-
[252.83s -> 263.69s]  Oh well. I wanna watch that back. I wanna see that heavy jump around the corner and, like, spoke me.
[263.69s -> 271.79s]  Get that built. Teams just scrambled, so that's a good thing, I think.
[271.79s -> 278.36s]  Maybe not. Maybe it scrambled in the same teams. Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!
[278.36s -> 288.87s]  Got my teleporter. This is gonna be my last run here, this last life. I'm gonna give myself one more life.
[288.87s -> 295.11s]  And we'll see if I can't pull something out here and not just die 50,000 times. Hey, are you a real spy? Yes, you are.
[295.11s -> 305.80s]  Yes, you are. This one's gonna go over here. Right over this corner. Right, no, right here.
[305.80s -> 311.38s]  Gotta watch that back area. That's a bad place to be.
[311.38s -> 318.79s]  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
[318.79s -> 326.81s]  Let's go, Jag! You gotta shine here, Jag. Get that spy too! Woohoo!
[326.81s -> 336.66s]  This is what I'm talking about. Oh no! Oh no! Uber, Uber and a scout. I can't do much right here. I gotta wait till that's gone.
[336.66s -> 342.31s]  No, no, get it up, get it up, come on, come on, get it up!
[342.31s -> 347.60s]  I don't care if it goes down. It's worth it. Nice. Nice job
[348.40s -> 361.90s]  Keep them off on here. Don't want to completely run out of metal here. You are a scout a real one
[363.72s -> 377.22s]  Making bacon teams pushing up. I think I think so moving up. Do I dare move this is the question here
[377.22s -> 384.94s]  You get some full metal. I'm moving up. I'm gonna do it. I had this my last life
[384.94s -> 385.60s]  I'm gonna do it
[385.60s -> 389.42s]  You know if I get myself killed I get myself killed but I'm going for like this room right in here
[389.42s -> 401.59s]  Like right here. This is probably a really bad spot, but it's all good. We got we got a capped
[401.59s -> 407.55s]  We got a capped move it up. Oh boy. Oh boy. Come on. Get it up. Get it up
[407.55s -> 412.00s]  Get it up before this guy comes around the corner. We're good
[412.00s -> 414.88s]  Oh
[414.88s -> 421.44s]  Wish I had the Wrangler cuz that's not close enough one century man. This thing has been alive
[421.44s -> 435.09s]  I can't believe no one's taking this thing down and push up damn. Oh man. I need it
[435.09s -> 443.44s]  You know, where's the teleporter exit right there? Go hurry get out of here. Oh, no
[443.44s -> 452.66s]  Let's move this thing up again. Let's move it like into like right here when they turn this corner
[452.66s -> 460.74s]  It is going to unload on these guys. There we go. I got the backup here. I get the backup
[460.74s -> 469.61s]  You know what? I gotta destroy this and I don't have enough metal, but I'm gonna build a dispenser up here for the crew
[470.43s -> 480.58s]  Where's the metal? There it is. Go go go jump up
[480.58s -> 488.79s]  Well, this one life has lasted fairly long time. Don't worry when he walks out this door watch this. Hey heavy
[489.15s -> 491.68s]  Oh

[499.23s -> 505.08s]  Bastard. Oh, I gotta pick this up. I was lucky
[509.34s -> 516.66s]  This thing has stayed alive since so many times when it should go down. It's just a complete stalemate
[517.02s -> 528.08s]  Hey scout, you're not gonna get this buddy. I'll plant it on you and I got a century kill. Hell
[528.08s -> 534.38s]  Yeah, and I lived longer this one life that I said I was doing one life than the whole damn time
[534.38s -> 540.24s]  I played this this run. Can we can I sneak this in here? Let's go. Here we go
