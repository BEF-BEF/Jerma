[0.63s -> 6.89s]  Yeah, I thought everybody was ignoring me. Like, there's no way that all of them can collectively
[6.89s -> 10.65s]  pretend that I'm not streaming. I was like, this is kind of crazy.
[11.29s -> 20.04s]  It's like, all right, maybe they can. Because I saw a bunch of- I saw at least five or six people
[20.04s -> 24.04s]  in all capitals live, live, live. But I think people just say that, no matter what, just to,
[24.84s -> 29.96s]  I guess, fuck with other people to pretend that I was live. Like, they had a stream, but other
[29.96s -> 35.11s]  people didn't. I was like, wait, how does that make any sense? I was sitting here talking to
[35.11s -> 43.67s]  nothing for at least 60 seconds. I did a Twitch broadcast test, an internet test. I was just
[43.67s -> 50.23s]  checking different things with this new connection to see what the best route is. And I think I got
[50.23s -> 57.59s]  it. I forgot it was on. So, it was still on when I pressed the now it's time to really stream. We
[57.59s -> 64.74s]  have 10 community subs from the chef's corner. The chef's corner has been incredibly generous
[64.74s -> 72.44s]  lately. Thank you, chef's corner. Appreciate it. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Welcome back,
[72.44s -> 78.73s]  though, guys. Hi, nice to see you. We have a very, very interesting week planned ahead of us here.
[78.73s -> 83.21s]  Well, mid-week into weekend. We're going to go back to the crack game. I just- the drug dealer
[83.21s -> 87.62s]  simulator. The crack game. We're just going to call it the crack game. That's what it is.
[88.18s -> 95.19s]  A nondescript civilian. Thanks for 10 community subs. 10 from nondescript and 10 from the chef's
[95.19s -> 99.59s]  corner. Thanks, both of you guys. Yeah, we're going to play the drug dealer game again just
[99.59s -> 104.95s]  for a little bit. I just want to play it. I'm kind of into it. I'll probably get my fill of it today.
[104.95s -> 111.72s]  Who knows? But tomorrow, we're going to get the real- the real schedule here. Because I've been
[111.72s -> 115.00s]  flipping it around because like, oh, it's going to be Thursday. That's going to be on Saturday.
[115.00s -> 118.36s]  That's going to be on Sunday. But that's going to be on Friday. But I want to play the crack game.
[118.36s -> 123.42s]  So let's- let's get it for real with the real thing here. Crack game tonight. Tomorrow,
[123.42s -> 128.06s]  we're going to do community content night. That leaves us with the weekend of Friday and Saturday.
[128.06s -> 134.28s]  Friday is going to be movie night. So that will actually be happening on Friday. Public domain
[134.28s -> 138.28s]  movie night is Friday. Like, that's- that's just it. That's the one- that's the day it's going to be.
[139.75s -> 143.51s]  Saturday is supposed to be the Easy Bake Oven stream. But I'm- I'm telling you right now,
[143.51s -> 151.58s]  I'm having a little bit of reservations on it for one reason. I can't- I- this- a space.
[152.82s -> 159.06s]  I probably am going to have to go to the studio to do the Easy Bake Oven stream.
[162.47s -> 169.82s]  Now imagine taking that phone call. Oh yeah, this is- this is the movie studio. Hi, yeah,
[169.82s -> 176.22s]  remember me? Oh yeah, the green screen guy. Yeah, that's me. What can I do for you? Oh, you know,
[176.38s -> 183.53s]  thinking about coming and using your space to use an Easy Bake Oven. That's all. I just want to use
[183.53s -> 190.26s]  an Easy Bake Oven at the studio. Oh, you just- that's it. Yeah, that's it. I just have like
[190.26s -> 196.68s]  20 recipes. Why don't you just do it at your house? Well, you know, because I want the space and I
[196.68s -> 200.52s]  want to be able to like fucking do like lookabays and stuff. I can't like- there's not enough space
[200.52s -> 205.78s]  with the cameras to catch me doing like lookabay when in the middle of it. Oh, that makes perfect
[205.78s -> 214.23s]  sense, Mr. Albertson. Absolutely. So, if I cannot get studio space by Saturday, then I'm- we're
[214.23s -> 219.05s]  gonna- we'll do it like a day or two later. But I'm gonna be in the studio for the Easy Bake Oven
[219.05s -> 225.74s]  stream. It just- I'm just gonna. Like, whatever. I'm gonna put like a fucking chef background
[225.74s -> 236.86s]  behind me on the green screen. It'll be a- it'll be a mess. Don't worry. Is the studio open? Oh,
[237.02s -> 249.19s]  shit. Ah, yeah. That's another thing, isn't it? Huh. Well, I- here's the thing. I have to assume
[249.19s -> 256.94s]  maybe because- oh, no. No, it's not. It probably won't be, right? Because it's like a- because
[256.94s -> 267.02s]  there's no- like, oh. I'll check. I'll check. I'll see. Because when you rent studio space,
[267.02s -> 271.50s]  nobody else is- nobody's there. It's like you're- you're renting part of the studio. So,
[271.50s -> 275.99s]  it's not like there'll be a bunch of people around. Um, I have no idea. I have to make a
[275.99s -> 285.10s]  few phone calls. Oh, Easy Bake Oven stream. Fucking cancelled. No. Uh, I just wanted to have
[285.10s -> 293.53s]  some more space. Oh, and the Toontown stream. First was the Toontown stream. No. Let's- let's
[293.53s -> 300.46s]  see what happens. If I have to do it from here, I will. But I have to set up the cameras in a way
[300.46s -> 306.22s]  where I can see everything. Because I don't want to have a- all right, listen. For streams that
[306.22s -> 312.54s]  happen when I'm on camera, I don't want another unlock card game stream. And what I mean by that
[312.54s -> 316.94s]  is forget about how fucking bad that stream could have- potentially was because the stream was just
[316.94s -> 323.10s]  bad, right? Let's talk about like how you couldn't see anything. You couldn't read the text. You
[323.10s -> 333.16s]  couldn't see the close-up. I want to make sure that there's like- you can see stuff. That stream
[333.16s -> 338.28s]  was horrible. I don't think it was horrible. It was bad. It was pretty bad because you couldn't
[338.28s -> 345.24s]  even like see. You couldn't read. I couldn't do basic children's math problems. Yeah, and you
[345.24s -> 349.00s]  couldn't read anything. The camera wasn't good enough. You know what I mean? I want to make sure
[349.00s -> 354.28s]  I don't fall down that path again. It wasn't as bad as Hearthstone. Wow, you must have hated that
[354.28s -> 364.26s]  stream. You must have hated that Hearthstone stream. But anyways, we're gonna play a more crack game.
[364.82s -> 369.18s]  Just gonna play it for a few hours. And then tomorrow, community content night,
[369.82s -> 373.90s]  I will get that prepared. It should be community content night up until-
[375.34s -> 381.94s]  like I'm like forever behind on community content night. We might have to do like a lightning round
[381.94s -> 389.38s]  to catch up because it's gonna be from like February like 10th- 15th or something to like March
[389.38s -> 397.14s]  15th. I'm gonna be forever like 30 days behind community content night. And I even did
[397.14s -> 413.96s]  two to- I didn't want to catch up and it didn't matter. No, skip. No, skip. No, skip. You're a
[413.96s -> 419.72s]  year behind the green screen stream. Well, if I get into the studio, then I can do a little bit
[419.72s -> 428.46s]  in front of the screen. I'll be there. But let's play. I'm gonna play this video game.
[428.46s -> 437.10s]  Or you know what it is. Move the thing so you can see. He's a year behind on VR. That's not
[437.10s -> 443.40s]  true. When was the last time I played VR? I played VR. I thought that was in my house.
[444.20s -> 449.59s]  I thought this was my room. And that just scared the shit out of me. I was like,
[449.59s -> 459.05s]  somebody open my door? When was the last time I played VR? It wasn't a year ago. It was like
[459.05s -> 466.25s]  two months ago. It was a long time ago. All right, what were we doing? I just got access to
[466.81s -> 473.06s]  ecstasy. By the way, I'm like just thinking about this right now. If you happen to
[473.06s -> 478.74s]  not know what was going on in here, and you just heard like from outside the door,
[478.74s -> 485.59s]  or like if you heard me talking like this, what would do you think? That'd be weird, right?
[486.23s -> 488.95s]  Okay, yeah, so I just got access to ecstasy. How much should I buy?
[489.91s -> 493.91s]  I'm gonna say like 20 grams of ecstasy and I'll sell the amphetamines.
[496.09s -> 503.75s]  That's I'm gonna be like quiet. Okay, I'm gonna like say these things quietly. I don't know.
[503.75s -> 509.27s]  You know what I mean? Like that's just fucking weird. All right, so I'm gonna call it. No,
[509.27s -> 516.50s]  I'm gonna. All right, there's orders. Remember Whisper, my mom's in the room. Drugs, drugs,
[516.50s -> 522.60s]  drugs, drugs. How did I just do that? That was 50 fucking thousand dollars from Freddy Dredd.
[523.24s -> 529.75s]  Freddy Dredd just gave 50 community subs. Freddy Dredd just drops thousands of dollars here.
[530.71s -> 542.68s]  The man, Freddy Dredd. Thanks a lot, Freddy. Thanks for the 50 fucking subs. That's so much.
[544.54s -> 551.03s]  Like I've, I've dropped like 100 community subs before. I've dropped like 500 community subs
[551.03s -> 562.79s]  before. That's a lot. Like 20, 30, 40, 50 subs, 100 subs. That's fucking a lot of money. It's,
[563.59s -> 567.11s]  I can't even believe people would do it. Thanks so much for fucking doing it.
[567.67s -> 571.91s]  That was a humble brag. No, no, that's me saying like I looked at my bank account after doing it
[571.91s -> 585.05s]  and went, holy fucking shit. That's a lot of money. But thanks, Freddy. And I'm just like,
[585.05s -> 588.97s]  I'm shocked that people want to give me that kind of money. That's what I'm saying. Thank you.
[589.61s -> 594.84s]  Flex, flex, flex. I just did it and it wasn't even on camera, but you know what I did?
[599.83s -> 603.75s]  I did, you, you, you saw it in your head. I didn't even need to do it on camera.
[603.75s -> 607.11s]  My fist went up, my fucking boink. I went like that, you know, like bonk.
[607.99s -> 615.61s]  All right. I got a fucking play. All right. I need weed, six grams of weed, two grams of amps.
[617.40s -> 625.42s]  No ecstasy, anymore weed. Okay. We need six grams of, uh, marijuana. Do I have marijuana? I do.
[627.19s -> 635.05s]  I need six grams. I'm almost out of marijuana. Fuck. And I have to buy more. What do I have?
[635.05s -> 641.43s]  Okay. So now I need, what do I need? Amphetamines and MDMA? I remember when this was a wholesome
[641.43s -> 647.29s]  Twitch channel. Not anymore. I've activated the mature audience filter. That means that if you
[647.29s -> 656.89s]  click on this stream, you are agreeing that you are a mature audience member. It has been activated.
[656.89s -> 663.30s]  Why do I keep thinking this shit is happening in my real fucking place? I was like, what? I was like,
[663.30s -> 674.81s]  are we being invaded? What the fuck is going on? I like, what am I supposed to, I keep thinking
[674.81s -> 683.56s]  this stuff is real. All right. We have six grams of marijuana. We have 10 more community subs on
[683.56s -> 689.24s]  top of the fucking shit load that I've already come through from numb legs. Thank you. Numb legs
[689.24s -> 699.11s]  for the 10 subs and more fucking oink. Six grams of, what was it? Weed. Okay. Two amphetamine.
[700.28s -> 708.04s]  Four amphetamine. Six amphetamine. Two ecstasy. Six amphetamine. Two ecstasy. Six amphetamine.
[708.60s -> 717.82s]  Two ecstasy. Six amphetamine. Two ecstasy. Six ecstasy. No. Six amphetamine. Six amphetamine.
[719.24s -> 736.22s]  Two, four, six. Two, what was it? MDMA. Do I have any MDMA or is it gone? One. Oh, here we go. Yeah,
[736.22s -> 739.90s]  I got, what am I, what are these other things? It's been a couple of days. I don't know. What
[739.90s -> 746.46s]  is this stuff? Dry rub amphetamine. One pack of ecstasy. One pack of new, new sugar mix mix.
[748.98s -> 759.14s]  And then $70. Okay. Well, I can, I can deliver this shit. Gotta be aware. 16 of, oh man. Okay.
[759.14s -> 774.39s]  Hold on. I need 16 more. All right. 16 of MDMA. What was this other one? Mike Byers. Oh right. I
[774.39s -> 779.38s]  just bought a place. All right. I'm ready to take all these. Here we go. I'm gonna make some money
[779.38s -> 795.45s]  here. That's my dealer, right? Yeah. What are my skill points again? All right. Illusionist.
[797.56s -> 806.02s]  So what's, what's, what's the actual percentage? What's the actual percentage? Bernie, what do
[806.02s -> 812.98s]  you mean? Bernie and Bernie in chat. Bernie Sanders in chat. The real Bernie's in chat.
[812.98s -> 817.78s]  I don't think that's not, I don't believe so. I don't think so. I really don't believe so.
[820.65s -> 828.58s]  Oh, it's probably a fake name. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a fake name. All right. I got it.
[828.58s -> 838.33s]  I got a delivery. It's cause somebody gifted him a sub. Yeah. All right. So yeah. That trick
[838.33s -> 843.13s]  only works a handful of times guys, before you sub every single game developer to me,
[844.31s -> 850.47s]  every major Twitch broadcaster and like five out of 10 of the celebrities I've talked about.
[851.83s -> 859.03s]  Like, holy shit dude. Wait, Jim Carrey was here? At Jim Carrey. He's got a sub dude. He's fucking
[859.03s -> 868.49s]  subbed. What? Jim Carrey subbed me? There's only so many times you can play that joke before I know.
[869.21s -> 881.72s]  All right. I'm looking for the police. All right. We're good. Nope. But he, he doesn't know. No,
[881.80s -> 890.25s]  I know. I do know. I got, when was the dealer? He wanted two grams of amphetamines.
[892.22s -> 903.00s]  One, two grand pack. Thank you sir. $24. Every, oh dude, did you know every celebrity you've ever
[903.00s -> 914.50s]  heard of all subscribes to you? Two grams of amphetamines. You got it. Oh shit. They don't
[914.50s -> 929.00s]  see me, right? No. All right. I gotta go. I gotta go across the street. Holy shit. I can't believe
[930.28s -> 938.84s]  real Taylor Swift and then, hey, super frog. Thank you super Bruce for the 20 subs. This is
[938.84s -> 944.63s]  just back to back to back to back to back subs. Thanks for the 20 subs, dude. Seriously.
[945.19s -> 952.55s]  That's so much money. That's so much money. Thank you super frog.
[956.90s -> 963.86s]  Oh, thanks Bruce. Oh, this is the big one. This is 16. 16 grams. Take it. There you go.
[964.82s -> 970.90s]  And I got you right next to you, Donald. He wanted the six grams of marijuana.
[971.62s -> 977.21s]  There you are. I'm almost at level uh, what was level eight, level 10? I've done almost all of
[977.21s -> 989.18s]  them. Can you fast travel or something? One of these days somebody's actually going to be here.
[989.18s -> 992.22s]  One of these days somebody's actually going to click on this fucking shitty stream
[993.02s -> 998.22s]  because somebody like linked them and they're going to just, they're going to show up and it,
[999.18s -> 1007.90s]  what? No, no, no. Well, yeah. Let me finish my thought. Like, hey, dude. Oh, Taylor Swift.
[1007.90s -> 1012.06s]  Check out this streamer. Oh, he's so cool. And they're going to get here and I'm just going to be
[1012.06s -> 1019.59s]  going. And this, this is what happens when you make a fucking joke. This is what happens. This is what
[1019.59s -> 1035.66s]  you deserve. This is what I deserve. Where's my house? Where's my house? Oh my God. Long story
[1035.66s -> 1040.06s]  short, there ain't no fucking celebrities here. There's no one here. Nobody's here. It's just you.
[1040.06s -> 1043.42s]  It's just you and me. We're the only two people that are here. It's just us. And I just lost the
[1043.42s -> 1049.26s]  money that I just sold. It's just like us, us 5,000 people. There ain't no celebrities. There's like,
[1049.26s -> 1062.78s]  Bobby Flay's not here, guys. Okay. It's okay. See, see right now somewhere in sunny California,
[1062.78s -> 1070.49s]  Bobby Flay is in his, is in his pajamas sitting there watching German 95 going, oh shit.
[1070.49s -> 1076.70s]  Oh, I don't know. Nobody thinks it's real. That's all right. Holy shit though. Wow. That was almost
[1076.70s -> 1100.60s]  bad. I can't fucking believe I lost everything. No, that was going so well. Oh, God damn it.
[1100.60s -> 1104.68s]  What do these guys want? At least I got the, I got the, I got the ecstasy to the dealer though.
[1104.68s -> 1112.71s]  That's the good thing. That was a family guy joke. No, that was a Jeremy Elbertson joke because I
[1112.71s -> 1117.77s]  just said it. Just because family guy goes like, Hey, wouldn't it be funny if, wouldn't it be funny
[1117.77s -> 1122.39s]  if, doesn't mean anybody else can go, Hey, wouldn't it be funny if, his family guy has not tarnished
[1122.39s -> 1126.31s]  the wouldn't it be funny if scenario. I refuse to believe that. And if they did, then that's a sad
[1126.31s -> 1143.32s]  day. All right, let's go back to the house. Oh, now we're going to say F. Oh, now we're, no, F's in
[1143.32s -> 1150.62s]  the chat, huh? That's so funny. It's hysterical. People do F's in the chat. Oh, he's getting
[1150.62s -> 1160.02s]  fibrid. Wait, wait, what? I knew I should, I did all those tests. I, I shouldn't have done that.
[1160.02s -> 1165.06s]  I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that. It's all right. I changed servers.
[1165.06s -> 1181.94s]  I shouldn't have done that. I knew it. I shouldn't have done it. Which one of these is my house?
[1181.94s -> 1187.54s]  See, I was doing through the VPN. I was just testing different servers. Which one's, hey,
[1187.54s -> 1191.38s]  but maybe let's try this one and see what the speeds on this one are. And I changed it and I
[1191.38s -> 1195.38s]  was like, yeah, that one, that one looks good. And I was fine. I don't know why I changed the
[1195.38s -> 1199.70s]  server. It was my own fault, but it's fine. All right. I still have plenty of drugs. Don't worry.
[1199.70s -> 1203.70s]  Did we just get somebody's more money come in? Are you feeling the burn? Thanks to the five
[1203.70s -> 1214.25s]  community subs and sweaty man. Thanks for five community subs using a VPN. Yeah. And it works
[1214.25s -> 1227.45s]  perfectly good. But I, I, what, why, why, why is this such a problem? No, I'm not streaming with
[1227.45s -> 1232.25s]  that. I'm not streaming with the one that people get paid to use. Okay. It's a different one.
[1232.25s -> 1237.29s]  And it's a secret because I don't know. It's, I like, I don't know. I have, I have my,
[1237.29s -> 1253.32s]  my virtual private fucking station, whatever it is, VPS. What? I don't use that one. No,
[1253.32s -> 1264.12s]  that's not the one. I don't use that one. No, I don't use that one. Stop saying that. You're
[1264.12s -> 1268.04s]  going to get me in trouble and I don't want to get in trouble. I don't want to get in trouble.
[1268.04s -> 1276.62s]  I've done. No, that's that one. No, it's not. All right. Okay. You guys are distracting the
[1276.62s -> 1283.10s]  fuck out of me today. I got arrested because you were distracting me. That's a real drug deal
[1284.22s -> 1290.97s]  like that. Hey, you got the stuff? Yeah, I got the stuff. All right. Hey, yeah. Come over here.
[1291.69s -> 1298.33s]  What do I owe you? You owe me. Hold on a second. I got a phone call. Hey, hey, hey, imagine if
[1298.33s -> 1305.29s]  Bobby Flay was, was calling me right now. Hey, Bobby Flay. Hey, it's me, Bobby Flay.
[1305.29s -> 1309.37s]  Can you imagine, dude? No, I think it's my mom. Hey, can we just like get this over with and,
[1309.93s -> 1314.65s]  whoa, I hear the, hold on. I think I hear the police, man. Hey, we're over here.
[1316.01s -> 1319.29s]  Imagine if they came over here after I yelled at them. Hey, look at this. Hey, have you ever
[1319.29s -> 1326.89s]  seen somebody do a stance like this? And you do like a fucking look at me. That person does
[1326.89s -> 1342.22s]  not keep going. I can't figure out if this is a minus two or a plus two. You don't have to
[1342.22s -> 1350.02s]  figure it out at all. Just fucking watch the TV. Why don't we have so many fucking
[1350.02s -> 1358.26s]  comedy detectives in here? Just watch the television. I'm trying to figure out if I
[1358.26s -> 1374.65s]  liked that or not. Let me do some math. All right, let's put this down. Wait, let me check the TV.
[1374.65s -> 1383.46s]  It's not, it's a laptop. Nobody to write. I got, at least I got it off to her. This is the important
[1383.46s -> 1396.17s]  one. I have nothing. Did I just sleep? No offense, but I think the look at me thing is really dumb.
[1396.17s -> 1402.82s]  Me too. That's the only thing that pays the bills nowadays. Okay. So just give me, just let me do
[1402.82s -> 1417.35s]  it every now and then, man. Come on. Come on, man. Oh, I got three words. Look at me, me and
[1417.35s -> 1433.59s]  the spider one. Just shut the fuck up, man. You're trying to ruin this for me. Take this out. I need
[1433.59s -> 1438.39s]  new clients. I need my, did they take the bag too? Please don't tell me they took the bag. Okay,
[1438.39s -> 1444.38s]  thank God. Hey, Justice Nugget, thanks for the five community subs. And what does he say every
[1444.38s -> 1454.73s]  time he gets five community subs? He says, look at me. Thanks though. Jesus Christ. Ballinx, thanks
[1454.73s -> 1463.82s]  for the five subs and Justice Nugget, thanks for the five subs. I have to give these free samples
[1463.82s -> 1475.72s]  away to people. Pick this up. Until I get my drug deal. What are the tasks? I need five addicts.
[1476.44s -> 1481.54s]  Check out the furniture shop. I already did that. Two grams of ecstasy, two grams of ecstasy,
[1481.54s -> 1488.60s]  two grams of ediphenibine, two grams of ecstasy. I have that. Okay. Thank God. Didn't take everything.
[1490.58s -> 1498.94s]  Store this. Actually keep a little bit out. Oh, this is the mixed up shit. This is the thing you
[1498.94s -> 1502.62s]  guys are all screaming. Wait a minute. This is not even ecstasy. I just faked myself out.
[1502.62s -> 1508.74s]  This is the fake shit. And I just thought it was real. That means it's good. I'll keep the
[1508.74s -> 1525.67s]  marijuana. Put the money away. I want to break this up. Let's put that on here. All right, here we go.
[1525.67s -> 1533.16s]  Finally. No, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. I hate F. Everybody else like hate F where E should be.
[1533.16s -> 1554.28s]  You know what I mean? I feel like that's not just me. F, F. Oh, no. No. Okay. You wanted to
[1555.24s -> 1564.76s]  put the rest of this shit away. No, put... I'm just gonna... Can I just throw this in the trash?
[1565.48s -> 1574.82s]  How do you get rid of drugs? I know this is not looking up how to dispose of a battery,
[1574.82s -> 1579.61s]  right? How do you get rid of batteries? But still, what am I supposed to do?
[1580.17s -> 1591.48s]  Okay, put this away. I want enough to give a couple samples out. All right, let's go.
[1592.12s -> 1601.67s]  I'm gonna get fucking arrested again. You cook a steak with it. You eat them. You don't waste them.
[1602.55s -> 1607.98s]  You don't waste... Did you hear that? I was like... I can't even do that again. Yes, I do. I have a
[1607.98s -> 1615.93s]  backpack on. That was like a full-on like... Wow, that was... I can't even replicate that.
[1616.73s -> 1626.41s]  Let's go. Is this thing bugged though? Because remember I went in the furniture shop last time?
[1626.41s -> 1643.42s]  Why is it not doing it? All right, here we go. Free sample. Hey, I have a free present for you.
[1644.06s -> 1653.11s]  It's one pack of marijuana. Try it on the house. I have something for you too. I have a one gram
[1653.11s -> 1678.90s]  pack of amphetamines. Take two. Take two. Share. There we go. Finally. I have to be getting close
[1678.90s -> 1685.67s]  to the next level, right? We're making drug addicts. I mean, that's the best point of the game. Hey,
[1685.67s -> 1692.28s]  you click the mature content thing. You can be here. I wanted two grams of ecstasy. Okay,
[1692.28s -> 1710.74s]  put that over there. Okay. Watch out for the police. What did you want? Two grams of amphetamines?
[1710.74s -> 1722.86s]  Yep. Share. Why do I sound weird? I don't know. I shouldn't. I sound weird? Is that a one guy
[1722.86s -> 1740.20s]  scenario? I mean, it failed. I just gave it to him. Oh, I don't sound weird. It's the game.
[1741.00s -> 1755.16s]  It's the fucking game. The game is playing twice. Right. Because sorry, I turned off my computer and
[1755.16s -> 1762.86s]  turned it back on and opened the GoXLR app, which resets my settings every single time I open this
[1762.86s -> 1771.78s]  program. I don't know why this happens every single time. Just save. Why can't I just save?
[1771.78s -> 1777.70s]  Do I have to make a full-on new profile? I'm on the dumb-up. Why would I make a new profile
[1777.70s -> 1801.54s]  or something? What the fuck? There you go. I will tell you though. I mean, you guys probably know
[1801.54s -> 1808.84s]  this by now. If there's ever a product that you hear me talk about that I like, get it as fast
[1808.84s -> 1816.73s]  as you can because that means it's good and it's real and I actually mean it. I'm serious
[1816.73s -> 1824.94s]  because everything I use, I just go, this sucks. This is stupid. This product is terrible. Do I
[1824.94s -> 1836.28s]  like anything? Have I been satisfied with any products I've ever purchased? What was the last
[1836.28s -> 1844.07s]  time I was satisfied fully with a product where I was like, man, I'm McDonald's. Yeah, but okay.
[1844.07s -> 1856.14s]  Okay, that's true. So go get McDonald's, I guess. That's the only thing that satisfies me.
[1857.48s -> 1863.05s]  That's fucking ridiculous. I mean, I can't think of one time where I've been like,
[1863.05s -> 1869.13s]  oh, McDonald's fucking, McDonald's like sucks. This thing sucks. I haven't said that in a long
[1869.13s -> 1876.26s]  time. Well, actually, that's not true. McDonald's, it depends on what McDonald's, right? Because they
[1876.26s -> 1881.48s]  differ in quality. One McDonald's could be a zero and another McDonald's could be a
[1881.48s -> 1889.72s]  six and they both serve the exact same menu. So that's hard to determine. You could go to a
[1889.72s -> 1894.28s]  nine out of 10 McDonald's and be like, wow, this is amazing. And then you go to a zero McDonald's
[1894.28s -> 1899.08s]  and it's just like they threw together the lettuce and they didn't even fold it correctly.
[1899.08s -> 1904.28s]  The bun is like soggy and off to the side and fucked up and the thing's cold. It's the same
[1904.28s -> 1915.56s]  food. That happens. He's a picky eater. What? No, that happens. The soggy lettuce and the
[1915.56s -> 1922.66s]  bun off to the side. Like, come on. Whenever I open it up and the bun is like wet and off to the side,
[1922.66s -> 1939.02s]  don't you just go like, oh, I do that. All right, we got to do seven grams of speed. I have it.
[1939.58s -> 1948.23s]  Here we go. Money. This is going to be a big buy. How close am I to the next stage here?
[1950.82s -> 1957.51s]  I'm almost at stink. I need 800 respect. Bristol meth is the next thing. Oh boy. When do we get
[1957.59s -> 1964.25s]  crack? You were one of those mac and cheese and hot dog kids every day, huh?
[1967.16s -> 1978.20s]  Wow. How wrong could somebody be? It was captain crunch. Get it right. Okay. Let's go. I have
[1980.07s -> 1985.75s]  any more deals? No, I just need amphetamines. Any more amphetamines? Should I just mix some
[1985.75s -> 1994.89s]  of this shit together? What did he want? Seven? Shit. Okay. Well, I'm going to have to give this
[1994.89s -> 2000.41s]  guy junk. Does this even have amphetamines in it? You know, it's bad when you don't even know
[2000.41s -> 2012.86s]  if there's even 1% amphetamines in this. The dry rub has it, right? It's getting dry rub.
[2019.11s -> 2042.81s]  What's that command? Oh, it's a fart command. How do I stamp a giant like notary stamp on this chat
[2042.81s -> 2050.82s]  room with minus two right now? How do I do that? Can I do that? Well, you get to do it to me.
[2051.54s -> 2073.40s]  No, no, I didn't want to change scenes. I wanted to see how you like it. Let's see how you guys
[2073.40s -> 2078.09s]  like this. When you look at the screen, this is all I see when I look at the screen.
[2079.56s -> 2105.83s]  This is all you see when you look at the screen. It's blurry. Well, sorry. OBS apparently doesn't
[2105.83s -> 2112.86s]  have vector-based graphics. Maybe I should ring him up and ask him. Well, he knows what
[2112.86s -> 2119.91s]  vector-based graphics is. I thought he was stupid. I got to rethink everything. $180.
[2122.06s -> 2137.96s]  Late. I don't want any drugs on me. You wanted the seven. Okay. He's going to hate this, but
[2137.96s -> 2149.32s]  I'm sorry, dude. Just take the dry rub and whatever. Bye. That's it. Anti-ali. All right.
[2149.32s -> 2157.98s]  Fine. You learned your lesson. None of you did. None of you did. Not one person did. Okay. 378
[2157.98s -> 2174.70s]  bucks. I got five points. Where's it going? Ah, fresh coffee. I like coffee, right? I can't do
[2174.70s -> 2190.33s]  illusion. I need six. I like, I love coffee. I'm going to say either quick learner or I'm doing
[2190.33s -> 2202.01s]  a quick learner. I want more experience. Yeah. EXP is good. Okay. I have to, now I just have to
[2202.01s -> 2213.54s]  unlock the new area. I can say the thing. Maybe one day. All right. Let's go back to the house.
[2237.21s -> 2254.50s]  Sorry. I phone vibrated that to you. Did you get it? I'm going to enhance it.
[2255.22s -> 2260.76s]  Wait, what did he say there? Check. Zoom in a little.
[2263.80s -> 2278.52s]  A little more. 10% more. Coffee, Cheetos, chicken. There it is. Yes. I knew it. He's still,
[2278.52s -> 2302.79s]  he does still love us. Fire. After 10 years. I heard you sell candy. I need four grams. Sure.
[2302.79s -> 2315.40s]  Delivering soon. That's all I have. I should probably get my, what was in, is there, can I
[2315.96s -> 2323.67s]  send this to a lab and find out what was in it? What's in this? I don't know what's in here.
[2323.67s -> 2337.54s]  I need to get a pill press, but I don't have access to it yet. This was sugar and ecstasy.
[2341.94s -> 2350.22s]  Just find out. This was ecstasy and dry rub. Why does dry rub have to be in everything? All right.
[2350.22s -> 2361.93s]  One gram of ecstasy. And then I'm going to, I'm going to do, somebody said that they left the
[2361.93s -> 2365.13s]  stream last time because they said this is such a bad organization. They refused to watch the
[2365.13s -> 2369.69s]  stream. So for that person, I'm going to make, I'm going to change this and make it look a little
[2369.69s -> 2384.55s]  nicer. All right. Let's get this out. Then I need to do, no, let me do another drug order.
[2385.27s -> 2390.60s]  I'm going to get a bunch of everything. I'll get a little of everything. I'll get some,
[2392.62s -> 2398.39s]  I'll get a little bit of, what do I want? Yeah. I want an order. I'll get a little bit of
[2398.39s -> 2405.50s]  marijuana, a little bit of amphetamines, and yeah, we'll get like 20 grams of marijuana,
[2406.14s -> 2413.80s]  a little bit of amphetamine, 20 grams of amphetamines, and then like 30 grams of,
[2415.91s -> 2419.75s]  I don't want too much of that. Why do I feel like I'm ordering off of a Chili's menu?
[2422.50s -> 2431.70s]  I can buy that, right? 580 bucks. All right. Let's go. Yo, I'm looking for grass. I need two grams.
[2431.70s -> 2445.06s]  Not yet. It's a subway subway. Yeah. I'll take a, an Italian, an Italian sub please. All right.
[2445.06s -> 2452.74s]  What do you want for cheese? I'll give me the Swiss, the Swiss triangles. Okay. Any more? Yeah.
[2452.74s -> 2459.43s]  I'll take some cheddar too. Okay. What kind of vegetables do you want? I'm thinking maybe,
[2459.43s -> 2467.58s]  maybe some of the kale. Okay. Yeah. Anything else? Maybe some, some of the spinach too.
[2468.46s -> 2475.26s]  All right. What drugs do you want? And he moves it down the little line and there's like six tins.
[2475.82s -> 2482.82s]  There's like fucking amphetamines. They're all crushed up and he sprinkles it in.
[2482.82s -> 2497.51s]  That's fucking ridiculous. That's a South Park joke. No, I don't want to give him everything.
[2497.51s -> 2511.35s]  Why? I don't even, I'm not even, because of like a barometer of every show you've ever seen and
[2511.35s -> 2524.41s]  everything they've ever said. That would have been funny, but I think I've seen that on Family Guy
[2524.41s -> 2531.99s]  once. Who even watches that show anymore? No, you can't have any of these. This is for somebody else.
[2537.40s -> 2556.25s]  Wait, is this for you? No. That's the real stuff too. Stream needs more Tom and Jerry jokes.
[2557.13s -> 2560.09s]  All right. I'll be right back. Let me go get a hammer and I'll hit myself in the fucking head
[2560.09s -> 2567.50s]  with a hammer. That's, is that you sure you want me to do that? Okay. Let me need more Tom and Jerry.
[2582.28s -> 2602.90s]  Who would be Tom? My left hand and Jerry would be the right. There we go. Oh, I got some new places
[2602.90s -> 2611.11s]  in my offer. I don't, I can't. All right. Is that, that's two hours from now. Damn. Okay. Speed,
[2612.07s -> 2620.42s]  grass, ecstasy. I need spray cans. I got to spray paint my tag around. Chat, stop being horny for
[2620.50s -> 2626.57s]  five minutes. Um, you know, I've thought, I've thought to say the same thing before,
[2627.61s -> 2653.27s]  but it's, they're uncontrollable. This is adults only. They're insane. I can't stop them. It's like,
[2653.27s -> 2658.95s]  what was his name? Odysseus, whatever his name was, the guy, like the god, the Greek god. And he was
[2658.95s -> 2663.35s]  like, I have total power. And everyone listened to him for a while. And then like they rose up
[2663.35s -> 2668.14s]  and fucking took him over and they became like their own gods. No, that was the French revolution.
[2670.44s -> 2680.68s]  What am I thinking of? Cronos. Yes. That's what I'm saying. Cronos. Cronos thought he had all power
[2680.68s -> 2687.40s]  and then like he fucking had to like eat his kids or something. Shit got all fucked up.
[2687.40s -> 2705.00s]  I just have to sit here. Wait, that was Saturn. Wait, what did Cronos do? Cronos was like the god
[2705.00s -> 2711.16s]  of time. No, don't base your knowledge on gods by what you know and what the smite god can do.
[2711.72s -> 2725.53s]  He's not the god of time. Yeah. Cronos had the ability to rewind time by four seconds.
[2725.53s -> 2730.89s]  It was arguably the greatest thing he could do. One would call it his ultimate ability.
[2734.57s -> 2759.69s]  My face. Is it ready? There's the Tom and Jerry joke. No, no, no. I didn't like have a nail
[2759.69s -> 2775.78s]  hammer into my toe and I didn't go. I guess I just did. Where's my drug drop?
[2782.38s -> 2790.17s]  Bop it. Tom was the original. No, was it Jerry? Who was the mouse? Tom was the cat. Tom was the
[2790.17s -> 2802.54s]  original bop it you lose sound. That's right. The face came on or you're an egomaniac. Wouldn't
[2802.54s -> 2815.75s]  putting the face came on make me an egomaniac? Thinking face. I'm just waiting for my drug
[2815.75s -> 2838.50s]  delivery. Don't keep it to yourself. Tom scream with the reverb now. Is it ready? Where's the
[2838.50s -> 2845.56s]  drugs? It's a lot. It's like a six hundred dollar drop. There's like two or three different ones.
[2845.56s -> 2866.18s]  There's a high one too. Where's that drop? Please. So what do you want me to do? You want me to have
[2866.18s -> 2892.71s]  reverb on? You want me to do the bop it sound effect? Do the face cam with it? Now where's
[2892.71s -> 2912.25s]  the drop? It's in two hours. Do it Jester dance. Dance Jester dance. What the fuck?
[2920.44s -> 2933.19s]  There it is. Dead drop package. He never had a chance.
[2936.46s -> 2941.02s]  All right. Look at this a lot here. Do not get stopped by the police. This is five hundred dollars
[2941.02s -> 2952.47s]  worth of drugs. I'm going to be in deep shit if somebody stops me. Do it for our entertainment
[2952.47s -> 2976.94s]  funny man. Funny man. All right I made it. We can rule this city together. Well I don't know
[2976.94s -> 2989.43s]  about that. Let's break this up into small packages. Let's do the marijuana. Amphetamines.
[2990.71s -> 3018.52s]  Ecstasy. Ecstasy. Okay let me get this right. Okay I swear to god I've um I make that noise
[3018.52s -> 3025.70s]  every fucking stream. I do that every stream. Anytime that something crazy happens that
[3025.70s -> 3045.32s]  noise happens. What's that? Okay that's the scream. What's the tie fighter scream?
[3047.80s -> 3058.38s]  What is it called? What's the tie fighter scream? Howie howie howie howie howie scream.
[3058.86s -> 3079.59s]  Sorry. That was pretty close to being that. That was actually better than the howie scream.
[3081.43s -> 3089.66s]  Besides the long ones just open up when I played Resident Evil 2 and you could over the course of
[3089.66s -> 3094.06s]  that 12 hours that I've 10 hours that I played that game these would match up somewhere.
[3116.66s -> 3132.73s]  Okay not these ones but like that those like this show is fucked up.
[3134.17s -> 3140.17s]  Like look at this shit. They like fucking murder each other. This is fucking crazy.
[3141.05s -> 3165.27s]  They like beat the absolute shit out of each other. Look at this. Dude that's a bear trap.
[3166.50s -> 3193.29s]  Jerry put a bear trap down so when he sat on it it would fucking kill him. Look that's a fucking
[3193.29s -> 3213.83s]  hammer. Was that a gun? Oh wait it was in the right foot. Oh just burn him with an iron Jerry.
[3213.91s -> 3231.93s]  Fight him on fire. Stab him with a knife. Drown him with bees in his mouth. Holy shit that show
[3231.93s -> 3249.91s]  is fucked up. Watch more. No I've got drugs to sell pretend in quotes. Cartoon violence.
[3252.60s -> 3256.84s]  Do you guys remember I mean I know like the cartoons of some cartoons are like crazy and
[3256.84s -> 3263.22s]  stuff now but dude like Daffy Duck. Daffy Duck used to get shot in the face with a shotgun
[3264.10s -> 3270.46s]  point blank. Like they would hold a shotgun up to Daffy Duck's face and blow his face off with
[3270.46s -> 3283.35s]  a shotgun. It's that it was fucking crazy. Ren got his teeth pulled out. Yeah I know.
[3288.57s -> 3297.62s]  Anyways his skull was. All right this cartoon is a fucking crazy.
[3304.14s -> 3324.17s]  Oh funny cartoon. Pifo happy. I got the drop. Here we go 18 G of ecstasy. I got that 18 G of ecstasy.
[3324.17s -> 3327.45s]  Hey man I really like your stuff. I have a few friends that are also interested. Could become
[3327.45s -> 3334.09s]  your dealer if you sell it to me. Wait what's this dry rub shit? Bring me something better. Hey man
[3334.09s -> 3340.23s]  I really like your stuff. So you you did use it correctly. You you finally used it the way that

[5646.39s -> 5654.98s]  around on all fours like sniffing around and like eating silica gel on the ground? Wait do
[5654.98s -> 5659.94s]  you think I like I mistake the silica gel for the restaurant packet of fucking sweet and low?
[5667.18s -> 5671.90s]  What the fuck? All right I know I'm like I'm weird but I'm not like
[5673.18s -> 5678.20s]  that's like that's fucking crazy. What? All right let's make our concoction.
[5678.84s -> 5686.31s]  We're gonna do ecstasy. We're gonna do five grams of ecstasy. What goes good with ecstasy?
[5686.87s -> 5700.34s]  How about sugar? How about silica gel? All right let's do it. No activate the
[5703.50s -> 5714.34s]  oh I gotta powder it. No I don't want to. I need the pill thing. All right put it back up. Put it
[5714.34s -> 5729.50s]  back up. Put this back. Bring these down. We'll do we'll do 10 grams. We'll do eight grams and
[5729.50s -> 5745.74s]  then two grams of something else. Do ecstasy. Okay one more. Then we're gonna cut it with
[5746.38s -> 5753.64s]  wouldn't washing powder like irritate your nose? Is that what people are doing with this?
[5756.78s -> 5767.67s]  Salt would hurt. Silica gel would I mean sugar or baking soda? All right we'll do sugar.
[5768.23s -> 5783.53s]  Put like two grams in here. All right now I can mill it. Baking soda. I don't think I have any
[5783.53s -> 5802.52s]  more baking soda. I mean I have silica gel but that doesn't that's not a good washing powder or
[5802.52s -> 5814.87s]  no balls. Okay. Silica gel is for storage. Yeah so I should put a baggie of the silica gel in
[5814.87s -> 5830.82s]  with like in the just inside the jar. Okay so this is precision. This is poor. It's amphetamine and
[5830.82s -> 5848.82s]  sugar. It's poor precision. Why? Should I add washing powder? You need a better cutting table.
[5849.54s -> 5869.93s]  Catnip. Well whatever. Why the mix? I spelt it wrong probably. Who cares? No I had it right.
[5869.93s -> 5887.80s]  It's diluted. I hate that 9.97. All right package it and I have to remember what this is. This is
[5887.80s -> 5896.89s]  diluted powder but I need to it's this is amphetamine. I know but fuck I can't.
[5897.69s -> 5902.44s]  Okay that's amphetamines. We're gonna add to it. We'll do washing powder this time.
[5903.08s -> 5912.98s]  We're gonna do a little kick of washing powder. Give me some silica gel. Oh no it's diluted.
[5913.06s -> 5936.73s]  Just fucking just fucking snort the whole counter. I don't know why that's making me laugh.
[5941.06s -> 5958.76s]  What the fuck? No I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. All right let's.
[5959.56s -> 5972.60s]  This is 9.7. 9.97. Let's add some washing powder. I can add three grams of washing powder.
[5972.60s -> 5986.58s]  Can you really do 350? Can I just dump the whole box? Can I eat like 10 boxes? Can I just cover
[5986.58s -> 5997.00s]  my desk with baking soda? How much is it? Oh no 30 grams is the max capacity there.
[6000.14s -> 6006.30s]  I guess I could just put it in bags and just make a desk out of baking soda. I don't want to spend
[6006.30s -> 6017.93s]  the time. How's it taking? That would take like an hour. That would take an hour. I can't do it.
[6017.93s -> 6030.04s]  Okay let's put this over here. It'll mix. It's a little bit. It's infinamine and washing powder.
[6030.04s -> 6047.59s]  Okay now we're gonna mix it up. Okay well I'm sorry one of my teeth just fell out. I had to
[6048.31s -> 6071.35s]  do something about it. Package. Well packets. Okay keep going. My eyes are itchy.
[6071.91s -> 6078.57s]  Let me just get itchy eyes for no reason. And then when you itch them it makes them worse.
[6079.61s -> 6086.68s]  Just way worse. Sometimes I'll slightly itch my eye and I know I'm not supposed to.
[6087.80s -> 6095.24s]  And then when I start touching my eye it heightens the itchiness by 10,000 percent. And then you're
[6095.24s -> 6101.22s]  like ha ha ha ha ha ha ha itch itch itch itch itch itch itch. And you can't stop it and it will
[6101.22s -> 6115.91s]  not go away. I don't tell them. What? Mix the amphetamines with the weed. I don't think I can.
[6116.71s -> 6125.38s]  Now I have to powder it. Okay what? Oh what uh the sink. I can put these in the sink right? Okay
[6125.38s -> 6141.70s]  hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna put it in the sink. I'm gonna try this. No bottles. Oh wait uh take
[6141.70s -> 6156.49s]  one of these bottles. How do I pick it up? I want to pick one of these up. Uh put it in my inventory?
[6161.02s -> 6173.75s]  Can I not pick this up anymore? Okay you know I could just have to walk away. All right let's
[6173.75s -> 6177.75s]  fill this drop with water. No bottles found in inventory. What the fuck are you talking about?
[6178.55s -> 6189.53s]  How do I fill up a bottle? I need a water bottle.
[6190.98s -> 6207.06s]  What? It's a jar. It's a container. It can hold water. All right so now this is let's mix this up.
[6207.62s -> 6228.97s]  It's a game. Pretending. I what you can't put water into a jar? I didn't. Sorry I didn't know
[6228.97s -> 6242.84s]  that the game didn't want wanted me to get like a bottle of like a water bottle. Okay I have and now
[6242.84s -> 6262.52s]  I'm the owner of. Let's see uh just throw this in the trash. What do I got? I still don't know why

[6268.18s -> 6281.62s]  Okay silica gel. Silica gel. Okay here it is. Diluted. Diluted mix. Put marijuana back.

[6291.22s -> 6301.83s]  thing and everyone got mad at me because I did this. Might as well add like 50% salt to it or
[6301.83s -> 6314.15s]  washing powder. Just mix everything. Guys this is not this is this is dangerous drugs. This is not
[6314.15s -> 6321.83s]  when you were six and you were making potions in the bathroom. Take two tablespoons of shampoo
[6321.83s -> 6329.18s]  and then mouthwash and mix it up with this and then add a little bit of water and then shaving cream.
[6329.58s -> 6334.28s]  If you didn't do that I don't believe you. This is not what this is. You just you know just make
[6334.28s -> 6352.66s]  like a magic potion in your bathroom. This is less dangerous than doing that. No what? Putting like
[6352.66s -> 6358.74s]  a little squeeze of toothpaste in a small cup and like a little bit of shaving cream and a little
[6358.74s -> 6366.31s]  drop of shampoo and mixing it up and saying I'm making magic potions. What's wrong with that?
[6367.03s -> 6379.29s]  This is less dangerous. Making mustard gas out of my chest.
[6388.58s -> 6405.00s]  You could have made no I wouldn't. Wait dude where do I where am I getting this bleach
[6405.64s -> 6411.32s]  like fucking ammonia? I wasn't allowed to have like aerosol cans guys. What are you talking about?

[6745.54s -> 6758.02s]  habits are fucked I tell I've told the story plenty of times but it seemed like bringing my
[6758.02s -> 6762.42s]  whole computer into the bathroom I would sit there if although there's probably some new viewers
[6762.42s -> 6768.50s]  I'll just TLDR this whole thing I I would bring my entire computer into the bathroom
[6769.06s -> 6775.21s]  and a little wobbly table and I would plug everything in and I would set everything up
[6775.21s -> 6783.08s]  and I would sit there and take a shit and play video games and it was always such an insanely
[6783.08s -> 6789.08s]  awesome idea it was like the greatest thing ever until you were done because then it was just
[6790.58s -> 6798.73s]  I have to fucking dismount am I gonna do this and I was just trapped there I like I couldn't
[6798.73s -> 6815.91s]  even move but man I'll tell you like it was and I don't I didn't think that was that weird

[9613.43s -> 9622.33s]  them these are pre-recorded subs now that's actually funny if I just do like six of these
[9622.97s -> 9627.74s]  and it's just banking fake people don't confuse the fuck out of a lot of people
[9628.54s -> 9644.47s]  and then there's two people up here level 10 new drug there is new stream that's half pre-recorded
[9644.47s -> 9652.84s]  and half live and have chat guests I got crystal meth now that would be really really hard okay
[9652.84s -> 9657.24s]  if those are that method the detective stream that would be very hard to do
[9659.22s -> 9666.14s]  because I would have to be able to take control but there would have to be a video the detective
[9666.14s -> 9681.66s]  stream was already just so hard and so many moving parts that was so much fun though if you
[9681.66s -> 9687.61s]  this is you might be new to the channel we did a game where I pre-recorded an entire stream
[9688.63s -> 9693.27s]  and then I just sat in the chat room with fake accounts and people had to try to find me and
[9693.27s -> 9700.14s]  find who I was in the chat and every about five to ten minutes there was a freeze in the video
[9700.14s -> 9706.26s]  and people had to pick and vote on who it was and some people got banned that shouldn't have
[9706.26s -> 9718.07s]  been I was I lasted a pretty long time do another one the thing about that though is that you want
[9718.07s -> 9722.31s]  to talk about oh wow what a that's a long stream wow that was a very very elaborate stream that
[9722.31s -> 9729.24s]  must have taken a lot of effort um it's more so the accounts need to be I need to have accounts
[9729.24s -> 9734.92s]  that are like more than three four five six months old subbed to people subbed to random
[9734.92s -> 9739.64s]  streamers following random fucking people and have activity on the account for like fucking two
[9739.64s -> 9758.42s]  years so that's where it gets to be hard what does he want oh I try to try to loot it I will
[9758.42s -> 9768.73s]  just give you my account no that's your account though I need ecstasy back home I need ecstasy
[9769.37s -> 9777.94s]  right now yeah and that somebody just said that also might be actually against terms of service
[9778.74s -> 9784.28s]  I don't think they probably wouldn't twitch probably be pretty unhappy with that somehow I
[9784.28s -> 9800.70s]  would assume just give me your accounts guys real distribution in sector b might get tricky

[12903.75s -> 12911.51s]  lettuce in salads on sandwiches cold sandwiches when you have a hot sandwich and you put lettuce
[12911.51s -> 12918.15s]  on it you're just adding a gross piece of paper that disintegrates into like this weird like
[12918.15s -> 12928.22s]  somebody said Reese's paper before it that's what it turns into a lot of time i love salads i love
[12928.22s -> 12935.74s]  romaine lettuce i think like romaine hearts that crunch on a salad on like a nice like a nice sub
[12935.74s -> 12938.46s]  you know if you're not like a nice italian sub you put like a little bit of you know maybe you
[12938.46s -> 12953.85s]  put a tomato on it whatever i love like bruschetta tomato delicious it's designed that way that's
[12953.85s -> 12959.05s]  e coli lettuce well that's what we call slander and um i didn't say it you did
[12959.05s -> 12978.86s]  it this is so loud lettuce lettuce is just like the lettuce is a scam they've the the fucking
[12978.86s -> 12988.44s]  lettuce lettuce the the big the big lettuce has found a way to convince you to eat water
[12988.44s -> 12994.76s]  i'm telling you it spits big lettuce big romaine
[13003.29s -> 13008.92s]  i actually do like lettuce though oh what am i i'm just walking around at night what am i doing
[13009.48s -> 13016.95s]  all right i oh eddie right i gotta pay eddie do a poll no because i know the things i'm saying
[13016.95s -> 13021.83s]  people are like he's fucking crazy i'm gonna take his blood pressure what is it at right now
[13021.83s -> 13028.70s]  is it like 180 over like fucking 160 dude relax it's lettuce i know but i don't i don't like
[13028.70s -> 13038.65s]  lettuce on hot food i think it kind of just adds nothing i think lettuce on cold food yes lettuce
[13038.65s -> 13053.26s]  on hot food i don't like it i don't like it that's okay what about on tacos
[13056.10s -> 13066.62s]  okay here's the thing about tacos hold on tacos got him not hold on just give me a second i'm
[13066.62s -> 13072.73s]  about to get fucking arrested for being outside all right hear me out about tacos tacos are an
[13072.73s -> 13079.69s]  interesting thing because the lettuce in a taco does not get hot like it does when you put it in
[13079.69s -> 13087.45s]  between bread and in a hamburger that's hot off the grill lettuce sits protected on top of two
[13087.45s -> 13092.97s]  or three different ingredients meats at the bottom and it's very bottom on top of that you've got
[13092.97s -> 13097.93s]  potentially fucking sauce cheese cold cheese by the way on top of that you've got potentially
[13097.93s -> 13101.69s]  like salsa and then on top of that you got lettuce lettuce never touches anything hot
[13101.69s -> 13106.49s]  the lettuce never comes into contact with any of the hot food putting the lettuce down on the
[13106.49s -> 13113.54s]  burger boom you've compromised it just i'm just telling you the things that i think
[13118.23s -> 13119.19s]  what about the tortilla
[13125.99s -> 13134.12s]  somebody wrote in all caps someone institutionalize him what the fuck it's not the same thing
[13134.12s -> 13141.56s]  because there's no top part of listen when you have a hamburger you are closing it up so the
[13141.56s -> 13149.64s]  heat gets like trapped in between the buns a taco is open at the top there is no top to a taco
[13149.64s -> 13155.88s]  you don't close the taco and have the meat heat up the lettuce so it gets hot and soggy and shit
[13159.88s -> 13160.84s]  lock this guy up
[13166.10s -> 13173.91s]  who puts salsa on a burger i'm talking about putting salsa on a taco by the way a salsa on a
[13173.91s -> 13177.91s]  burger this i'm sure there's some that exists where like you could put something like i don't
[13177.91s -> 13188.06s]  know there's probably different like creations and you'll be hearing from my lawyers i like putting
[13188.06s -> 13192.30s]  shit on burgers you know i i like putting interest i like that would probably be kind of good
[13195.46s -> 13198.74s]  no wouldn't oh i don't like to like what to me i'm saying no what stuff
[13202.63s -> 13205.75s]  and by the way can we get over this like put mac and cheese on everything
[13207.54s -> 13215.08s]  can we get over this i i don't understand it put mac and cheese on your hamburger put mac and cheese
[13215.08s -> 13233.21s]  on your pizza put mac and cheese on your lobster i'm over it lobster mac is so good i know but
[13233.21s -> 13242.63s]  like crab is better than lobster why is there no crab mac and cheese why is it always lobster mac
[13242.63s -> 13246.23s]  and cheese how come there's no crab why they don't like the crab so much crab is better than lobster
[13249.10s -> 13257.34s]  king crab is better than the best lobster i've ever had crab is just it just better than lobster

[15029.50s -> 15034.63s]  thing ever again i beat the whole game the evil within yeah but the evil within is not considered
[15034.63s -> 15041.37s]  a bad game i just didn't like it um probably odama there's no reason why i would play that
[15041.37s -> 15048.90s]  again it was just it was horrendous to me there's no reason for me to go back and play that again
[15050.34s -> 15057.35s]  for what reason would i ever do it i could somehow in some stupid weird world find a way maybe where

[16062.20s -> 16067.48s]  grill that's great i know like burger on the grill that's like level one of like the fucking super
[16067.80s -> 16077.61s]  intelligence meme thing right right at the very end corn corn on the cob slather it in a garlic
[16077.61s -> 16088.39s]  butter and just grill it right on the grate grilling is the best like grilling's the best
[16089.03s -> 16095.03s]  it's like one of my favorite things i can't believe you just said that it was a the boomer
[16095.03s -> 16100.38s]  way to make food well how do you make a burger you put it in like a pan i mean yeah i put it in the
[16100.46s -> 16106.63s]  pan i guess but if you have access to a grill it's just exponentially more flavors there's so much
[16106.63s -> 16114.79s]  more going on now i would i will give you this grilling's a pain in the ass because if you have
[16114.79s -> 16122.49s]  a charcoal grill you have to preheat the grill you've got to put the coals in you've got to heat
[16122.49s -> 16129.83s]  the coals up dump them in there it's dangerous i get it but it's way better i mean that is that
[16129.83s -> 16137.08s]  just my opinion i think i don't know i think it is yeah it takes a while it takes like 20 minutes
[16137.08s -> 16141.80s]  to heat up coals and then it takes a long time for the grill to heat up it's a process but you
[16141.80s -> 16148.12s]  do it you hang out you make the you get the you get some party hats and get a couple of
[16148.12s -> 16157.29s]  seats just hang out outside get the grill going make some birds and dogs man get some corn on
[16157.29s -> 16170.44s]  there right on the grate garlic butter just hang out i said birds birds and dogs not birds although
[16170.44s -> 16180.07s]  you could put you could put chicken on there if you wanted to i'm sorry i disagree i don't know
[16180.07s -> 16185.43s]  where you get the idea that burgers on the grill are bad you know that burgers on the grill are
[16185.43s -> 16193.46s]  good when an entire chain pretends that they do it that way burger king's whole ad campaign
[16193.46s -> 16208.07s]  is about pretending to grill their hamburgers flame broiled flame grilled grill grill marks
[16208.63s -> 16219.86s]  flame you don't get you don't get a fire in a microwave you don't get a fire in an oven
[16220.42s -> 16234.42s]  just doesn't happen and if it does you get a big problem moving on ike turtle thanks to the 250
[16234.42s -> 16238.18s]  hey lettuce hater you probably let your burgers sit up for like three hours before you eat them
[16238.18s -> 16243.22s]  because your weak teeth can't handle fresh lettuce i made this hamburger today and i put lettuce on
[16243.22s -> 16248.97s]  it because i have strong teeth lettuce lads and it's a deleted link anybody have it anybody get
[16248.97s -> 16259.59s]  the link stripes beast thanks for 250 germa i swear to god the perfect burger you described
[16260.23s -> 16269.34s]  is the buttery jack from jack in the box your perfect burger is like five bucks no it's a
[16269.34s -> 16275.34s]  mushroom and onion swiss bro no it's you that's not even accurate that's like saying your favorite
[16275.34s -> 16282.49s]  okay so mcdonald's has a fucking bacon cheeseburger is my favorite burger going to be from mcdonald's
[16282.49s -> 16288.52s]  the baconator from fucking wendy's or whatever oh yeah that's right no there's a version of it
[16288.52s -> 16295.43s]  that exists it's like a popular way to make a hamburger if you make your own baconator it's
[16295.43s -> 16303.30s]  going to be way better than if you get it from burger king it's just it's a difference see no
[16303.30s -> 16312.04s]  it's not what do you mean no it's not it's wait if you order a baconator from wendy's and you
[16312.04s -> 16317.56s]  make your own baconator on the grill are you trying to tell me that you that they're the same
[16318.28s -> 16328.31s]  oh i have no no no way what who is saying this there's nobody in this chat actually saying this
[16328.31s -> 16341.02s]  if you guys have a made bacon on a grill you can do bacon on the grill it's and it's i don't know
[16341.02s -> 16347.51s]  how to do anything i don't know how to cook at all cooking on the grill is awesome because it's just
[16347.51s -> 16361.54s]  the caveman fire fucking way to cook hot is hot fire food burn flip done you don't need no shit
[16363.50s -> 16370.55s]  smell good take off fire eat you don't need to oh well first get a little bit put some oil
[16370.55s -> 16374.63s]  and then add a put a marinade on that and then slip it down over here and then get the
[16374.63s -> 16379.99s]  and make sure you put delicately put it into the oven for 15 fucking minutes at 425 degrees
[16379.99s -> 16388.76s]  take it out put it back in the pan no no no fire burn meat yes you don't have to know shit
[16388.76s -> 16401.08s]  it's the best way to cook because it's like you can't really screw it up you can put like
[16401.08s -> 16404.84s]  literally anything you want and like here's how you tell if something's done on the grill
[16409.51s -> 16424.81s]  take it off you eat it you can burn it yeah but you don't it's it's it's all you follow
[16424.81s -> 16437.08s]  the directions you're fine he knows how to cook he's just lazy grilling no lazy grilling takes
[16437.08s -> 16442.84s]  so much prep work it's unbelievable it takes like exponentially like three times more prep
[16442.84s -> 16448.86s]  to get a grill going than just to turn the burner on your stove on it's not the lazy way it's the
[16448.86s -> 16456.57s]  no no it's the exceptionally lazy way because it takes a ton of work to get it going and then
[16456.57s -> 16464.92s]  you just sit there while your food just sits on a grill you don't have to do shit you don't use
[16464.92s -> 16472.38s]  propane i really don't want to start an argument here about how like hardwood versus propane like
[16472.38s -> 16479.72s]  wood fire and coals i really don't want to start an argument here but i could about hardwood and
[16479.72s -> 16489.48s]  wood grilling and coal grilling versus gas and propane grilling i could start a fight here there
[16489.48s -> 16498.46s]  ain't nothing in this world there are a few things that really get me going and that can
[16498.46s -> 16508.31s]  never be compared to and one of them is the sound smell and sight of hot coals at the bottom of a
[16508.31s -> 16518.20s]  grill when you when they dump in there and they make that like and the smell it's just that hard
[16519.00s -> 16525.82s]  and the sight that just you see the fire you see the the red the orange hot heat
[16526.38s -> 16532.10s]  fire get that grill back on and you can you get that just ain't and they ain't much like it
[16532.10s -> 16542.55s]  this is boomer talk no it's not come on no way it's like a hot this is the boomer talk
[16545.83s -> 16551.74s]  hot coals are just so such a sure it is boomer talk you know why because people were cooking
[16551.74s -> 16557.50s]  with like this for a fucking hundreds of years they didn't have a button they turned on and
[16557.50s -> 16563.90s]  this is you want to call me a boomer this is like super boomer this is like fucking caveman boomer
[16563.90s -> 16569.50s]  okay they used to cook on rocks guys and it just it's something about it is there's so much
[16569.50s -> 16577.21s]  interesting history with like grilling over hot wood it's it brings you back to the fucking 1700s
[16577.21s -> 16590.74s]  when christopher columbus made the first weber grill they had stoves go back even further go back
[16590.74s -> 16598.41s]  to go back to go back to the 1200s they used to cook on rocks on the ground coals hot charcoal
[16598.41s -> 16610.70s]  carbon they also had stoves in the 1200s go back even further go back to go to 680 the smell the
[16610.78s -> 16620.01s]  air was so clean fresh hunting they would and the coals hot still stoves in six when did they not
[16620.01s -> 16630.26s]  have stoves when did humans not have stoves when did they cook on rocks when was it it was like bc
[16630.26s -> 16642.54s]  we've always had stoves no we have not before but wait you're telling me that you told me bc before
[16642.54s -> 16651.75s]  christ like jesus was using a stove that's kind of a weird image isn't it like can you got you
[16651.99s -> 16658.70s]  can you picture jesus like cooking macaroni on a stove that's like kind of weird right he's like i
[16658.70s -> 16662.38s]  i think about like the magical things that i've written about him and he's like just sitting there
[16662.38s -> 16670.60s]  stirring like food like stirring like fucking macaroni and cheese macaroni wasn't invented yet
[16671.34s -> 16677.62s]  go back then no go forward and then go back go forward to get a box of mac and cheese and go
[16677.62s -> 16684.86s]  back to fucking 2 ad and get it on those hot coals the point still stands there ain't nothing like
[16684.86s -> 16692.86s]  hot fucking rocks and wood that's cooking your food and the best part the smell doesn't leave
[16692.86s -> 16700.38s]  your body for two weeks you will run your fingers through your hair and you will just be like why
[16700.38s -> 16706.63s]  does it smell like an ashtray in my hand ah but it's a good ashtray it's like a hardwood it's a
[16706.63s -> 16722.23s]  carbon it's a heat it's a it's it's a strong hot smell okay moving on it's a strong hot ashtray
[16722.23s -> 16730.28s]  just nuke your food in the microwave we already went over the fact that that can you cook a full
[16730.28s -> 16739.96s]  turkey in the microwave every time it makes me laugh how long do we even come to a determination
[16739.96s -> 16745.88s]  how long what would the time be like 70 minutes like 60 minutes in the microwave
[16750.23s -> 16754.95s]  i know the mr bean thing but but seriously like how what would it actually do at like low power
[16756.46s -> 16770.89s]  one minute on max probably 40 minutes at like two out of 10 would it explode
[16773.22s -> 16778.70s]  not at minimum power right it would be seven to nine minutes per pound
[16779.42s -> 16782.38s]  so you're talking about like more than an hour at low power in the microwave
[16783.34s -> 16797.19s]  it would be cold inside it would just be raw it would just be steam it
[16798.34s -> 16808.41s]  can you steam a turkey how would you steam a turkey you can steam a turkey
[16810.65s -> 16819.54s]  easy makeup and turkey a boiled turkey oh my god oh that's that does not sound good
[16825.85s -> 16830.55s]  anyways let's run the credits thanks for sticking around we'll see you tomorrow for

[17594.90s -> 17600.02s]  don't want to talk about medical stuff i do sometimes unless i kind of know what i'm saying

[17604.18s -> 17615.37s]  i don't want to do that i'd rather just do it and see what happens it has nothing to do with an
[17615.37s -> 17628.26s]  injury i will tell you it's not an injury thing i will maybe have some more info hopefully if
[17628.26s -> 17634.86s]  it turns out that's what it was but i don't know i have right now i've been diagnosed with costa

[17689.83s -> 17696.34s]  have a sister you never knew and then that she passed away that's two sort of two very very
[17697.14s -> 17706.84s]  kind of earth shaking things i'm really sorry to hear that but thanks for the 250 and stay safe i
[17706.84s -> 17715.96s]  wish you and your family the best we are almost at the end of the bits here we had 500 bits from
[17716.60s -> 17722.74s]  thank you bat mom 250 from rosy briar get well soon germa i'm doing all right i'm doing just fine
[17723.62s -> 17731.85s]  i'm good thank you appreciate the concern thanks for five dollars and 64 cents pond of this streamer
[17731.85s -> 17739.10s]  a burger with the meat marinated not dipped in barbecue sauce and a fried egg uh i'm gonna i
[17739.10s -> 17746.20s]  have to stop you right there i'm sorry i have to stop you there i don't like egg i don't like egg
[17746.20s -> 17753.78s]  on my meat uh i don't like the no i'm sorry i'm not an egg i'm not a fried egg on burger guy i
[17753.78s -> 17762.23s]  know people love it but it's a it's a textural thing for me because when you bite into the egg
[17762.23s -> 17767.43s]  and if the egg starts to run and then all you got a problem with the egg running and it's runny egg
[17767.43s -> 17774.65s]  in your burger i know people love it and it's a huge kim loves that shit she's a huge fan of that
[17774.65s -> 17782.09s]  but i'm i'm not really that big of an egg guy either i like hard-boiled eggs i don't like runny
[17782.09s -> 17793.53s]  eggs i think that's my problem i like a a jammy egg but most places that do egg on a burger
[17794.39s -> 17799.91s]  it's deliberately in my opinion and not even my opinion it's actually deliberately well make
[17799.91s -> 17806.15s]  sure it's a big runny egg bite into it and get the fucking egg all over you it's like deliberate
[17806.15s -> 17811.99s]  they do it on purpose that's what that's every restaurant i've ever been to doesn't like that
[17812.55s -> 17820.07s]  but i'm maybe i would like it if it was a jammy kind of old medium over medium egg rather than
[17820.63s -> 17826.28s]  over easy maybe i would like it but i just don't like the runny egg it's a textural thing
[17827.29s -> 17832.42s]  also you ever considered playing metro exodus it can be finished in three streams yeah i thought
[17832.42s -> 17838.98s]  about it i played i beat metro 2033 on stream and then i had a meltdown in the first 30 minutes of
[17838.98s -> 17845.88s]  last light and vowed to never play the whole series ever again for some reason i don't i have
[17845.88s -> 17851.64s]  no idea and it was like it's kind of like the halo scenario where i had such like a bad stream
[17851.64s -> 17857.78s]  kind of moment that like the game is now fucking ruined because like the stream i was like so
[17857.78s -> 17863.30s]  fucked up and so like annoyed or i couldn't like do the first mission or something and now like
[17863.30s -> 17873.98s]  the game is ruined for me it's weird how that works he's just traumatized but maybe when maybe
[17873.98s -> 17882.60s]  eventually i don't know i'd have to play last light first because 2033 was good it was a lot
[17882.60s -> 17889.51s]  of fun and i beat it i'm assuming i would like the next one i just had a huge issue for some
[17889.51s -> 17895.27s]  reason that day a bulbous whack thanks for the five dollars russian car driver is the best worst game
[17895.27s -> 17900.22s]  i've ever played full of awful translations and poorly designed ui i would recommend it
[17901.11s -> 17911.62s]  russian car driver never heard of it hey adison thanks for the three dollars hey germa i've been
[17911.62s -> 17916.50s]  loving listening to your streams while playing animal crossing lately have you played anymore
[17916.50s -> 17922.65s]  with kim actually no i have not i've not played any animal crossing it hasn't really been a whole
[17922.65s -> 17929.38s]  lot of time just recently have kim and i really started to settle and there hasn't been some
[17929.38s -> 17937.80s]  something crazy that needs to be set up or done or uh so maybe now that these last like a few days
[17938.36s -> 17945.02s]  but now i haven't played it the villagers all moved oh does that happen oh well i'll get new
[17945.02s -> 17950.09s]  ones uh anything else show official thanks for the five dollars hey germa when will you do the
[17950.09s -> 17956.47s]  public domain movie night two days and what weird movies and games do you think are underrated i
[17956.47s -> 17960.49s]  want to find something new to do during the quarantine any movies and games that i think
[17960.49s -> 17972.10s]  underrated friday is the public domain movie night but stuff to do that's weird or underrated
[17976.46s -> 17982.71s]  watch ghost busters one and two watch gremlins two especially if you haven't seen gremlins one
[17982.71s -> 17994.62s]  and two watch them today um i would say gremlins is a pretty underrated series uh curvy enthusiasm
[17994.62s -> 18000.54s]  is pretty is a pretty highly rated series a lot of people know about that underrated ghost busters
[18005.30s -> 18014.73s]  not a movie well they said movies and games i'm doing the movies part first games i mean the
[18014.73s -> 18021.35s]  easiest one to say is sorcery i think that's the criminally most underrated experience although
[18021.35s -> 18027.66s]  it can be kind of frustrating if you if you weren't around years ago sorcery is it's probably
[18027.66s -> 18039.26s]  the most underrated experience for a game herb your enthusiasm is my favorite soulsborne game um
[18040.39s -> 18050.22s]  i don't know besides that i don't know other games that are underrated that i play or liked
[18051.34s -> 18056.68s]  i've played so many games it's like hard to keep track sometimes there are games that i forgot
[18056.68s -> 18061.24s]  that i've played that actually happened recently i think somebody brought it up in this stream i
[18061.24s -> 18064.36s]  was talking about like playing it and somebody was like hey i think you did that i'm like maybe
[18064.36s -> 18069.32s]  like a month ago somebody said it what was the game that i said that i that i didn't know that
[18069.32s -> 18078.58s]  i played already oh and yeah enter the gungeon i streamed enter the gun i streamed it and i'm

[18117.62s -> 18131.88s]  that's pretty cool hey pigeon thanks for the 250 i probably should have mentioned that i was like

[18186.07s -> 18198.92s]  all depends if you claim your car as a dependent i would recommend against not doing that uh but
[18198.92s -> 18204.28s]  you should file taxes i would recommend getting in touch with a certified public accountant a cpa
[18205.16s -> 18209.16s]  or if you're worried about potentially wait i had a bunch of money that i didn't pay taxes on to get
[18209.16s -> 18231.78s]  a cpa and help you out with it just use turbo tax yeah yeah but if you don't people you can make
[18231.78s -> 18245.18s]  mistakes on turbo tax you be careful some people can potentially make mistakes on there just don't
[18245.18s -> 18256.68s]  make mistakes yeah but if you had income last year i yes i highly advise you filing a return
[18257.32s -> 18262.92s]  although hey i will tell you uh the date to file a return has been extended in the united states
[18262.92s -> 18269.00s]  i believe to july 15th it usually is april 15th is tax day it is now july 15th apparently so
[18269.00s -> 18277.99s]  got some time to figure that out if you haven't done it good luck yes you have to pay pay your
[18277.99s -> 18283.26s]  fucking yes you have to pay your taxes and no you're not going to get in trouble as long as you

[18604.22s -> 18609.13s]  the source code for tf2 is leaked if you play tf2 you'll get a virus
[18609.93s -> 18622.07s]  i don't get it but so somebody just will make their own tf2 and that wouldn't that mean that
[18622.07s -> 18629.46s]  like somebody has to make their own tf2 and inject it with something bad how would they
[18632.57s -> 18647.74s]  know people are finding ways people are finding out a way to remote code execute oh valve said
[18647.74s -> 18658.04s]  you don't need to worry about it well let's hope that's not a problem that sounds kind of insane
[18658.76s -> 18664.82s]  source code is almost two years old and valve themselves they said there's no cause for alarm
[18664.82s -> 18674.28s]  at this point oh well somebody fuck somebody get fucking norton on it somebody somebody called
[18674.28s -> 18685.99s]  norton um that's kind of fucking horrible if that's true well tf2 hasn't updated in three

[18720.31s -> 18725.03s]  started this whole youtube streaming career as a normal guy and through your success you've kind
[18725.03s -> 18729.03s]  of been pushed into this huge influential position that people look to for support does that stress
[18729.03s -> 18737.88s]  you out at all um not really because i think i've been very clear from the very beginning
[18739.54s -> 18746.58s]  that i've i've i've kind of just been doing this one thing that i think is fun and i really try not
[18746.58s -> 18756.28s]  to like inject very much more than my intentions here so we make a lot of jokes and we fuck around
[18756.28s -> 18762.36s]  a lot here and but i never want to get to a point where i'm kind of i've it's been like this for a
[18762.36s -> 18771.69s]  decade i don't i want it to be fun and i want it to be just something that i like to do and when
[18771.69s -> 18776.33s]  you talk about like influential positions looking for support i've made it pretty clear that i i'm
[18776.33s -> 18792.68s]  just kind of a guy and i don't hold very many large i don't hold very many like when people ask me for
[18792.68s -> 18799.42s]  advice i always say like i'll give you some the best i can but i'm not somebody that can i'm just
[18799.42s -> 18807.62s]  a guy that likes to have fun and that's kind of been the mantra since like 2012 but if i can influence
[18807.62s -> 18811.46s]  you to stop eating fucking gross lettuce on your hamburgers and oh i'm going to use it but no it

[18898.47s -> 18902.89s]  no matter the strength of your teeth it brings any delicious burger down with it no wonder it's
[18902.97s -> 18911.69s]  called iceberg lettuce much like the iceberg to the titanic monkey s damn didn't even think
