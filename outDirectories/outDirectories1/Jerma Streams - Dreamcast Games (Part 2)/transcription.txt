[1.46s -> 10.71s]  Hey, phone call is good. I just, I had to take care of something. Something I didn't know that
[10.71s -> 13.27s]  I had to take care of, but I did have to take care of it, so I took care of it.
[16.54s -> 23.61s]  Welcome to Dreamcast Day 2 of the Dreamcast Stream Central.
[29.62s -> 35.29s]  Taking care of it. Give me one second, I gotta uh, I gotta tweet that. I'll see you guys in a
[35.29s -> 99.99s]  moment. All right, good afternoon. Good evening. All those things. I remember this screen. I
[99.99s -> 104.89s]  don't know why we're getting this screen again, but it's a good place for us to test the audio,
[104.89s -> 110.60s]  because I know a lot of people said last last or day night that it was out of sync.
[111.16s -> 114.73s]  So let's go ahead and see if we can get it in sync. Are you ready?
[118.97s -> 125.94s]  Here we go. You should be hearing my voice and the sound at the same time.
[127.29s -> 134.41s]  And here we one two three four one two three four five one two three four five six seven eight
[134.41s -> 155.14s]  nine ten eleven twelve one. Voice is behind. Okay. So the voice is behind. Really? What if
[155.14s -> 161.46s]  I give you one of these? One two three four eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight.
[162.36s -> 180.89s]  There. Voice is still behind. The voice is too early now. No, no way. Hold on.
[187.77s -> 197.13s]  Do a little thing like this. One two three four one two three four five six seven eight nine
[197.13s -> 208.97s]  ten eleven twelve. All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[209.77s -> 216.01s]  The game is a bit behind. Well, I can fix that too. Check this out. I have a ton of magic
[216.01s -> 222.92s]  tricks here. You ready? How about this one? One two three four five. Welcome to the
[222.92s -> 238.62s]  troubleshooting stream. Five six eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three. Oh the first
[238.62s -> 246.06s]  game by the way is the worst one. I need to get it out of the way as fast as I can. I saw
[246.06s -> 249.82s]  it on the table and I said I don't want to play this. I don't know why did I buy this?
[250.86s -> 255.83s]  It's not the evolution game. It's the fucking worst game ever. It was just a Dreamcast
[255.83s -> 263.93s]  exclusive. That's the only reason why I bought it. Never mind. I take back everything I just
[263.93s -> 302.68s]  said. Uh his mouth is even doing. You know I'm glad we got to see at least this part here.
[303.48s -> 318.04s]  This is Toy Commander. Who gave that little kid explosives? That's it's supposed to be a
[318.92s -> 331.86s]  it's him imagining things. Run around in his house. All right so I don't know.
[331.86s -> 350.86s]  No. Evil? The evil crew? Andy the time has come we toys are sick and tired of how you are.
[351.66s -> 359.10s]  How you use us then toss us aside. So prepare for the mutiny as I Huggy Bear claim the title
[359.10s -> 372.98s]  of Toy Commander. So this is Toy Story 5. This is the toys rise up and like strangle
[372.98s -> 387.85s]  old Andy. Well he's in his sleep or something. Yeah it's the trip to the nursing home to find
[387.85s -> 394.02s]  Andy. W6Y. I don't I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. It's three letters.
[395.30s -> 418.63s]  I don't care. Well that's boy that's Andy. A lot of uh don't give a shit about copyright
[420.49s -> 425.53s]  in some of these Dreamcast games. Not even copyright but like referencing
[426.41s -> 435.08s]  other like western media for some reason right? Copyright? No my point is is like
[435.88s -> 443.75s]  we had the whole family guy cast in the last game for some reason and now it's like Andy
[443.75s -> 472.49s]  toy game Andy. Okay so let's do 16 by 9. I'm not sure this is going to do anything. Is
[472.49s -> 480.70s]  this game older than Toy Story? No no way. Dude you don't have a game about toys. This
[480.78s -> 486.86s]  looks awful now. It just looks like I stretched it up or whatever. Who cares? Kitchen and dining
[486.86s -> 496.87s]  room. The rest of the house is coming soon. All we have is the dining room in our shelf.
[498.10s -> 509.26s]  Open the draw house. Okay kitchen and dining room. Training. Boiling rage. I am cyclone
[509.26s -> 513.90s]  and I am the boss of the kitchen. Each room in this house has its own boss. If you can
[513.90s -> 517.98s]  beat our records in at least four missions you'll be tested against us. If you defeat us
[517.98s -> 521.98s]  we'll become your allies. Then you can pilot us in the final duel against the Toy Commander.
[523.56s -> 527.56s]  Land the plane on the runway then use the helicopter to drop two sugar lumps into the
[527.56s -> 534.04s]  cup of hot cocoa. Finally use the pickup truck to find the chocolate bar. I'm liking the
[534.04s -> 541.98s]  Pee Wee Herman quests. Holy shit, Jerma, this game is my whole childhood. I never could
[541.98s -> 548.66s]  remember its name. Well it is Toy Commander. I'm glad you can see it and figure it out.
[549.54s -> 565.38s]  How do you fly? Okay right triggers fly. That's what I have to do. Grab the sugar.
[575.50s -> 579.82s]  Open world. This is the kitchen from Rat Movie.
[582.62s -> 589.58s]  It kind of is. All right grab the sugar. No land on the runway. Land on the runway. Okay.
[602.36s -> 630.63s]  Oh I didn't get it. Stop. How am I not on the runway? Land on the runway. This is the
[630.63s -> 643.37s]  runway right? Did I not land on the runway? Okay well let's go ahead and get the sugar.
[644.09s -> 669.19s]  How do I open it? How does it want me to open the sugar thing? I'm gonna throw up
[669.19s -> 690.33s]  play this for more than two minutes I think. Oh wait what was that? Switch planes. All right
[690.33s -> 723.53s]  land in the cup. How do I switch planes? How do I change vehicles? Okay how do I get out?
[725.29s -> 746.02s]  Okay it's apparently X. Come on you're not gonna tell me the controls of the game?
[746.74s -> 757.80s]  All right I gotta lift up this thing. What button is that? What button is like lift up sugar
[757.80s -> 777.99s]  thing? The sugar isn't there. What? Look at the mini map. That's not the sugar? The grid. I'm
[777.99s -> 801.26s]  no I'm supposed to put the sugar into the cocoa. There's no where's the sugar? Wait so
[801.26s -> 806.76s]  what the hell is the other? Look at the mini map. What's that for? What is that even for?
[806.76s -> 824.62s]  Look at the other mini map. Why is it on the sugar bowl? That's inverted fucking throw up
[824.62s -> 862.07s]  controls by the way. Name of song. You really care about the song? Okay got it. It's a
[862.07s -> 874.47s]  chocolate candy. It's harder to fly this than I think it is to fly a helicopter in GTA 4
[874.47s -> 897.59s]  with the mouse and keyboard. I gotta change to the truck? I'm about to run out of time.
[898.55s -> 939.80s]  That how do I just change to the truck? Time is gas. Land on chocolate. Yeah I don't like I can't
[939.80s -> 958.68s]  change off the helicopter. Go pick up the pickup truck. This is supposed to be tutorial which
[958.68s -> 966.82s]  but in my mind is this is how you control the game. There is no explanation as to how
[966.82s -> 972.26s]  to change vehicles. It said go pick up the sugar and then pick up the cocoa and pick up the
[972.26s -> 988.62s]  cat poo. I don't have it. There's no I don't have a manual. Read the manual. I bought this used and
[988.62s -> 994.84s]  it came in a black fucking box. All right I pressed x last time and it didn't do that.
[994.84s -> 1027.93s]  Where the fuck am I supposed to go from here? I'm just on the table. Sorry I'm even distracted.
[1044.15s -> 1061.67s]  Does the cat do anything? Okay why why the truck is definitely more fun than the helicopter.
[1073.16s -> 1079.93s]  So do I have to pick up the truck? Because the only other indicator on the minimap is up there.
[1081.05s -> 1091.06s]  So do I pick up truck and put the entire game is this level? No it's not.
[1091.86s -> 1120.58s]  The food grinder? I would have loved this as a kid. So probably I would have too.
[1121.14s -> 1153.43s]  Cat box? The yellow ramp against the wall. What? Where's the yellow ramp?
[1154.23s -> 1161.70s]  Am I actually blind? There's a yellow ramp against the wall.
[1162.58s -> 1169.86s]  No you guys this is you guys are horseshitting me here. Yellow ramp that goes up against the
[1169.86s -> 1178.10s]  wall. You guys are shitting at me right now. No way. Which wall is there a yellow ramp?
[1179.06s -> 1186.68s]  No that's not a ramp. That's a half pipe. Not even. What's this is not going to do anything.
[1186.68s -> 1190.76s]  Why does this work? How would you ever know this was going to work? There's no laws of
[1190.76s -> 1194.44s]  physics that's to explain why I'd be able to drive up the wall and stay on here.
[1194.44s -> 1200.18s]  There's no fucking way. Somebody in chat looked up the guide and figured it out.
[1207.42s -> 1213.50s]  Go up the little tiny half track and drive up the wall and drive on the ceiling.
[1214.98s -> 1233.00s]  Oh my god I'm looking at chat. I did it. I went. Kids logic. No one would ever do that.
[1234.06s -> 1257.54s]  No kids are gonna do that. When you guys are saying ramp I thought you were talking about
[1258.42s -> 1262.82s]  an actual ramp that could take me driving on a regular plane with real physics.
[1263.46s -> 1274.78s]  Not go up the small yellow McDonald's symbol. Drive up the wall. I'm glad my kid wouldn't
[1274.78s -> 1280.86s]  fucking understand that because he would be he'd be he'd be logic about it. He'd be asking me
[1280.86s -> 1285.42s]  dad I don't see a ramp that an actual you know in real life that you'd bet I'd be like
[1285.98s -> 1299.64s]  me either. I'd pat him on the head. I didn't even read the instructions.
[1301.10s -> 1305.74s]  You've managed thus far but you're nothing unless you can cook. Drop the eggs into the water and
[1305.74s -> 1323.43s]  don't forget to light the stove. Okay I'm ready. I need to pick up eggs. All right hold on.
[1323.43s -> 1329.75s]  Where are the eggs? Does it say where they are? Drop the eggs in the water. That's all we
[1329.75s -> 1340.55s]  get. I don't think that's an egg. That's a lighter though. I feel like I have to get the
[1340.55s -> 1348.95s]  other tank up there. That's fuel. All right eggs. Fridge. If I were a bunch of eggs I'd be in
[1348.95s -> 1371.61s]  the fridge. No there's eggs right here. All right so I need to switch because unless I go
[1371.61s -> 1380.18s]  and land and push them into the water from this side this level is not going to take
[1380.18s -> 1397.83s]  12 minutes. Got it. Okay they got one. Time to beat is one minute and 30. Yeah but you're
[1397.83s -> 1401.11s]  not expected to do that first try. It takes a minute to figure out where the eggs even are.
[1408.87s -> 1431.42s]  Throw up controls. I need like a joystick. It's a toy commander if you're wondering.
[1432.73s -> 1454.46s]  And it sucks. All right now it's gonna light the fuse. Stop stop stop stop.
[1458.74s -> 1462.18s]  Do I need to land on a special children's runway? Is that what this is?
[1462.90s -> 1477.86s]  All right do I have to find the one spot where I'm allowed to land? Guys.
[1488.57s -> 1491.21s]  Ah stop. Inverted stop please.
[1510.74s -> 1517.75s]  Can I change that shit? I forgot that game companies didn't realize how terrible it was
[1517.75s -> 1539.78s]  until like 2006. Plane altitude reverse. Is this is this it? No that's not it.
[1539.78s -> 1561.11s]  No it is for the plane. What I'd want is I'd want inverted before the plane.
[1561.91s -> 1577.45s]  Toy commander. I thought I was gonna break this desk on spring.
[1578.25s -> 1586.65s]  I think I might. This is still it still wants me to put an egg in here.
[1586.65s -> 1597.21s]  How am I gonna do that? It's destroyed. I'm gonna have to just reset the game.
[1605.98s -> 1612.84s]  That's not gonna start a fire. I thought I was supposed to be using kid logic.
[1612.84s -> 1634.52s]  Kids don't know how to use the stove. I do. Okay it's on. I'm burning the
[1634.52s -> 1649.70s]  fucking house down. So what was the point of giving me the tank in the first place?
[1649.70s -> 1660.12s]  I thought I had to change to it. Is that just a different way to go?
[1660.76s -> 1669.11s]  All right well here's this one. It's called rings of fire. Okay.
[1673.46s -> 1677.38s]  If you're a speed runner you go plane only. Okay this is a race.
[1679.30s -> 1680.42s]  Let's just fly through the ring.
[1680.82s -> 1695.48s]  Everything is bullshit. Everything is bullshit.
[1703.72s -> 1707.24s]  Okay who's increasing my speed? What's with the frame rate?
[1712.66s -> 1716.10s]  Where are you even trying to tell me to go?
[1717.45s -> 1744.47s]  What? God. This is horrible.
[1744.47s -> 1754.92s]  Superman 64. I have to beat this one. Wait I can kill the other competitors here?
[1755.80s -> 1781.66s]  Well immediately. What is it? What? I don't understand. Hold on. It's right next. It's the same ring?
[1784.86s -> 1808.68s]  Now I'm of the opinion that video games were terrible.
[1809.64s -> 1814.12s]  But as children we were forced to play them because it's the only thing we had in the house
[1814.12s -> 1820.28s]  there. You couldn't just go and get a game on Steam. You couldn't go buy a game where
[1820.28s -> 1823.32s]  you're gonna go to GameStop. Mom you're gonna drive me to GameStop. No there was
[1823.32s -> 1830.42s]  no free to play Fortnite. There was no free to play TF2. If your mom got you a game at the grocery
[1830.42s -> 1834.44s]  store you had to play it and you played it all fucking day because it's all that you couldn't
[1834.44s -> 1858.39s]  go. It was all you had. I wonder how many games that I actually because like I'm sitting here
[1858.39s -> 1862.71s]  right now as an adult and going like man this is horrible. This sucks. Why would I ever play
[1862.71s -> 1869.54s]  this? If I got this as a kid I would have 100% at every single level and I would have been
[1869.54s -> 1874.98s]  like this game's awesome because that's all my mom got me. Like this is all like I can't get
[1874.98s -> 1894.47s]  anything else. They didn't have video games when you were a kid? Yes they did because they
[1894.47s -> 1901.58s]  also weren't jaded. Yeah and like there's been too many. Like GTA 5 exists. You know what I
[1901.58s -> 1921.85s]  mean? With two spoiled as gamers. Okay take down the enemy bombers. But regardless of
[1921.85s -> 1925.93s]  what you think about GTA 5 these are like technically speaking this is just flying around
[1925.93s -> 1948.30s]  the living room shooting at radical v2 sets. The game that I played that was just painful
[1948.30s -> 1953.34s]  but it wasn't painful to me because I played it and I loved it. I'm trying to think which game
[1953.34s -> 1987.78s]  it would be. I'm about to scream like mom go get me something else. I played Mario Golf at
[1987.78s -> 2013.80s]  Anthony's and I want it too. Mario Golf came out good. What a game that was. No one had
[2013.80s -> 2031.13s]  played golf before on a computer but they're all above. Are we on different teams?
[2032.25s -> 2092.14s]  How do I keep missing this guy? All right that was quite demanding. This is your base.
[2092.14s -> 2104.26s]  I know but I can't. There. Okay I Mario golfed that guy. Hole in one. Just sit here.
[2104.26s -> 2140.25s]  I am using the radar. What does this have on IGN? It hurts. That was Toy Commander. I can't do the
[2140.25s -> 2172.84s]  controls anymore. Let's move on to a good one. God I'm gonna nostalgia's gonna hit me in the
[2172.84s -> 2190.46s]  face here. This is not even gonna be fun. Let's do Power Stone. We've been so that was a nine
[2190.46s -> 2200.86s]  on IGN but it probably makes sense though. That was like so long ago. All jokes aside
[2200.86s -> 2213.02s]  this game is actually really really awesome. Highly recommend. This is Power Stone.
[2222.06s -> 2229.69s]  Rage quit this one. No! Did I rage quit Dynamite Cop? No I beat it three times. I thought it was
[2229.69s -> 2234.09s]  great. Then it was a fun game. One of my favorites. I'm not gonna rage quit. Power Stone!
[2235.05s -> 2235.61s]  Here it comes.
[2246.33s -> 2271.24s]  Here it comes. Falcon. Wang. Gun Rock. There's Power Stone 2 as well.
[2272.92s -> 2284.74s]  Fuck it didn't do it the way that I said. Still good. So how the game works.
[2286.26s -> 2294.66s]  It's a fighting game. Uh kind of. It's a fighting game. The whole point is there are
[2294.66s -> 2302.97s]  Smash Balls. Wait I think they got that idea. So there are three Smash Balls that
[2302.97s -> 2307.77s]  will uh show up. What you gotta do is you gotta collect them and you get three Smash Balls.
[2307.77s -> 2312.17s]  Three Power Stones. Your character turns into the Power Stone version of their character.
[2313.21s -> 2320.31s]  So I wonder. Let's play Jack. All right I don't really remember the controls or anything
[2321.03s -> 2326.89s]  but it's very fun. Jack versus Jack.
[2348.33s -> 2350.89s]  One two. Got them both. Got them all. Here I am.
[2353.83s -> 2369.54s]  Essentially you have to avoid them. It's two stones. Don't let them get the other one.
[2369.70s -> 2370.18s]  Knock them out.
[2374.02s -> 2377.54s]  Oh yeah knocked it out of the hem. I'm gonna uh where's it this way. One more.
[2388.30s -> 2389.34s]  I am the green Jack.
[2399.75s -> 2401.27s]  Now take two of your stones.
[2401.27s -> 2407.43s]  You gotta just bully in the very beginning and get three stones as soon as possible.
[2408.47s -> 2413.66s]  We jumped over it.
[2418.39s -> 2422.30s]  No wowies. Okay that's all right. That's all right. That's okay.
[2424.14s -> 2426.54s]  Uh oh. Not okay. Where's the yellow one?
[2429.62s -> 2435.67s]  Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Over here.
[2436.55s -> 2455.86s]  Ah. Got him with the bump. This game is so much fun. Let's just go ahead and beat the
[2455.86s -> 2476.63s]  whole game first right. In Lundo. Lundo. He's like kind of the red Power Ranger.
[2484.46s -> 2494.82s]  Uh oh. That's not good. Can't take this much damage.
[2494.82s -> 2516.54s]  Got it. Gotta get a good hit. Got it. Got it. One more. Got it. One more. That's okay. We're good.
[2519.96s -> 2522.20s]  He's not paying attention to any of the gems. This is a mistake.
[2524.44s -> 2527.40s]  Uh oh. No, no, no, no, no. He's gonna get blue. I'm gonna get yellow.
[2528.36s -> 2537.67s]  Okay. Soft screen. Holy shit he just tailed me.
[2555.53s -> 2559.37s]  I know there's like a block or a dodge I think. From what I remember.
[2560.17s -> 2562.70s]  Reverse or I know there is.
[2562.70s -> 2577.22s]  Oops. Lost the other gem, didn't you?
[2580.02s -> 2593.13s]  Take it. Let's go. Damn it. Oh man. He's smart. I'm getting kind of beat here.
[2596.46s -> 2601.70s]  Oh that was bad. I need to go and like practice and learn to do those blocks and stuff.
[2602.50s -> 2605.58s]  Grab two.
[2618.36s -> 2637.53s]  Are you smarter than a dream cat? Maybe that's you. No, just get the stones. Just get the stones.
[2651.13s -> 2654.62s]  I'll take it.
[2656.54s -> 2673.75s]  No. See there it is. There's the dodge. How do you do that? There's that like dash. How do you do that? Trigger?
[2685.40s -> 2716.33s]  What block is? I'm so like. Got it.
[2716.33s -> 2728.41s]  Holy shit if he kills me in power stone form it'll be so embarrassing.
[2729.69s -> 2740.95s]  Thank you. Freudian weapon for five community subs. Play with italics. I don't have another
[2740.95s -> 2755.48s]  controller. I don't have two dreamcast controllers unfortunately. Go back to toy commander.
[2760.60s -> 2765.64s]  Why would you want me to do that? Hold on. Is it okay? Button config. Here we go. All right.
[2765.64s -> 2773.74s]  Jump. Grab. Punch. So what's the dash? Power fusion one. Power fusion two.
[2774.62s -> 2781.02s]  Yeah you get a special move. Two of them. Maybe saw falcon do it. But then you lose your power
[2781.02s -> 2794.63s]  stone. So let's grab. Dash with that maybe. That's not good. Damn it she got it.
[2796.92s -> 2804.98s]  No what's that? Sorry I only get hit by one thing.
[2805.62s -> 2823.46s]  Oh a direct hit right in her head. Let me try those one of the fusion.
[2827.58s -> 2837.14s]  Let's see what happens. Oh exactly that's awesome. So I get in close and do the cyclone.
[2838.66s -> 2865.75s]  Look at the jumping. Can blow. Didn't get her. See ya.
[2865.75s -> 2883.90s]  I don't know how to do that with it.
[2891.27s -> 2893.51s]  This game is cool. This game is very cool.
[2896.65s -> 2903.82s]  Fine you want to play that game? Get you right at the wake up.
[2921.54s -> 2923.78s]  Thank you. Very cool. What's the other special move?
[2924.50s -> 2932.66s]  The jump above you. You do right trigger and that's the other special.
[2933.30s -> 2944.02s]  I also can't understand why Capcom has not made a new one of these. They only came up
[2944.02s -> 2957.72s]  for Dreamcast. They were only available for Dream. One and two that's it. It's such a cool
[2957.72s -> 2963.16s]  franchise that even it's a very simple combo concept. But they could turn it into something
[2963.16s -> 2968.52s]  so much bigger. But the popularity of games like Smash right now. You wouldn't want to
[2968.52s -> 2973.86s]  have like your own kind of version of this.
[2979.06s -> 2991.78s]  And then you're the other one.
[2994.02s -> 2995.78s]  That's not a good place to be. Especially right now.
[2995.78s -> 3005.35s]  Into the meat grinder. Oh he's a fan. I got it.
[3021.72s -> 3027.72s]  There's a lot of dynamic with who has one, who has two. It's really fun just to try to
[3027.72s -> 3033.99s]  dance around the fact that even when you have three, this could be a waste of time.
[3035.83s -> 3038.23s]  Somebody put, there was a lot of people who played this game that didn't even give a shit
[3038.23s -> 3040.47s]  about the gameplay. Just went for the, just went for the kill. That's it.
[3041.99s -> 3045.64s]  Because it was too much of a distraction. So oh what? Randomly spawned.
[3059.02s -> 3067.80s]  Oh now let me, let me two stalk him. Come on. He's gonna get all three. He is. He turns
[3067.80s -> 3068.36s]  into the thing.
[3073.11s -> 3073.43s]  Fucked.
[3079.06s -> 3080.42s]  That kind of sucked. I'm not gonna lie.
[3088.17s -> 3093.61s]  And we keep going back. I'm not gonna get it.
[3096.49s -> 3105.66s]  Dominoes of Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut. I'm gonna, I'll tell you first try I'm gonna get to the end.
[3109.18s -> 3123.66s]  Or lose. Did you say wrong? Pizza Hut has stuffed crust. I don't really like to order
[3123.66s -> 3129.82s]  either of them. I like local places. I like local places. But if I'm gonna order Pizza Hut
[3129.82s -> 3140.89s]  for Dominoes, I'm gonna get the stuffed crust. All right they're all three around. One, two, three. All the same
[3140.89s -> 3155.48s]  corner. Every Pizza Hut smells like a bowling alley. No it doesn't. All Pizza places smell like
[3155.48s -> 3171.42s]  a bowling alley. Every Pizza Hut is next to a bowling alley. I mean I'm not gonna argue with that.
[3189.75s -> 3197.77s]  Bowling alley is usually served with served pizzas. Yeah. What's the matter with bowling
[3197.77s -> 3202.97s]  alley? I don't like bowling in bulk. And I find it. I can, I can see.
[3206.41s -> 3210.01s]  You know what? Okay I'm gonna give you guys a little bit of a how the hell is it possible
[3210.01s -> 3216.89s]  scenario. So bowling is like an old like boomer thing to do. That's what a lot of you
[3216.89s -> 3225.13s]  would say. Right? So how do bowling alleys survive and not arcade? Bowling alleys are
[3225.13s -> 3230.33s]  like kind of old and old school and a lot of arcades don't go away.
[3233.11s -> 3238.49s]  It's the same thing. A lot of arcades have closed down. They've kind of been
[3240.49s -> 3246.65s]  stuffed into the Gaven Buster style. But actual, you think of a bowling alley.
[3247.29s -> 3255.82s]  What the fuck is a corporate bowling alley? They don't exist. It's like Bob's bowling alley
[3256.46s -> 3262.46s]  or the Lanes. One guy owns it. It's not like a corporation. There's no big bowling company.
[3269.10s -> 3275.00s]  So the Gaven Buster's argument like doesn't work there. How did they get to stay in business? And
[3275.64s -> 3290.97s]  arcades didn't. Mom and pop arcades I mean. I guess that their overhead really is not that
[3290.97s -> 3297.16s]  much maybe. How much does it cost to run a bowling alley? I mean you'd probably have the
[3297.16s -> 3307.67s]  same balls and same pins for a long time. All right I gotta pay attention. I'm at the final
[3307.67s -> 3314.63s]  second of the whole line. All right I'm getting dumped on here. I'm getting dumped on. I'm not
[3314.63s -> 3337.30s]  gonna get perfect. All right. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me.
[3347.08s -> 3354.94s]  Yep. Don't let the wake up happen. No no no no no no. Don't let the wake up happen.
[3354.94s -> 3364.02s]  She's getting both the stones. Greedy. He went for the stones.
[3369.29s -> 3375.72s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Direct hit. No. Get her with the bomb.
[3378.52s -> 3394.20s]  Do it. You didn't even see. Really. It's like a beta so hard by the computer.
[3397.08s -> 3418.06s]  Knock them both. Give me. Give me. Give me. Shit. God damn it. This is bad.
[3419.02s -> 3486.79s]  Oh my sweaty hand. Uh-oh. That. No. No. Where'd it go? What just hit me? What? Hit me. All right.
[3487.99s -> 3496.70s]  We're at the final battle with the Captain Hook flapjack character.
[3502.07s -> 3506.47s]  I mean let me first try Power Stone after like 15 years of not playing it. Come on.
[3506.47s -> 3533.82s]  I'm ready. No. Environment.
[3552.28s -> 3563.46s]  He's just trying to get the gems. He's just a gem hoarder. Last one. Got it. Twice in a row.
[3564.26s -> 3586.58s]  Got it. Environment. Get him with the environment. One more time. Shit. He has a gun.
[3592.97s -> 3595.05s]  Oh. He got greedy and it was downfall.
[3596.65s -> 3618.86s]  All right. No. Shit. I got too greedy with it. I can still do it. I can. I'm in trouble. No.
[3637.66s -> 3651.22s]  Oh no. I'm gonna die here. He didn't even use his special. Good. Where'd he go? Oh, he's
[3651.22s -> 3663.18s]  holding on. Okay. I see. All right. I gotta get it one more time.
[3670.66s -> 3701.27s]  Fuck. Did I win? Fuck. Shit. No. Oh, the timer. Oh, I had it. Come on. Let's go.
[3713.08s -> 3718.62s]  That was horrible placement. You see that bullshit? That was bullshit. That was
[3718.62s -> 3750.68s]  unfucking believable. I just got screwed. Really? That was so salty. That was such bullshit.
[3751.40s -> 3756.84s]  I knocked him into all three of them. That was such. I fucking actually mad about that.
[3758.84s -> 3768.70s]  I literally knocked all the gems out of him and he fell down into all three. That was
[3768.70s -> 3781.50s]  stupid. I had it, too.
[3786.78s -> 3789.26s]  I was gonna do a first try. Oh, well.
[3801.53s -> 3803.37s]  Did he just catch me in the air?
[3803.37s -> 3822.42s]  He's doing his little cheat move where he just. All this guy cares about is the smash ball.
[3823.38s -> 3826.84s]  So I don't even care about the smash ball. Just beat him.
[3839.35s -> 3848.81s]  Baby. I should have had it that first try. Those of you Power Stone vets will know what
[3848.81s -> 3872.26s]  I'm talking about. He was. He wasn't focused on it.
[3874.74s -> 3893.64s]  See? Look. He cares so much about this. I should have just fought him like this the whole time.
[3903.91s -> 3919.62s]  Give me both. Move out of my way. You greedy asshole. Your character bottle's too big.
[3920.34s -> 3944.87s]  Oh, God. He's gonna do it again. No. Why? What the fuck? That's so stupid.
[3946.07s -> 3957.77s]  It was in his. Oh, I'm gonna die. He just. Just fucking. Oh, my God. I'm so angry.
[3965.19s -> 3970.41s]  The dude just drop kicks you once. He has a move. He has a move where if he. If he
[3970.41s -> 3974.33s]  touches you with it once, he just. It's like a beep and it knocks out your stuff.
[3974.33s -> 3977.21s]  This guy's too hard. I hate this again and again.
[3984.47s -> 3998.54s]  Thankfully, this move sucks. God, I just got too mad. I'm so tilted from that first fucking
[3998.54s -> 4008.54s]  try. Fucking asshole pirate. His body. He's got like a fucking square of a hitbox that
[4008.54s -> 4019.16s]  he can just push into you. Are you ready? That's that move right there. It is a half second
[4019.16s -> 4022.12s]  frame.
[4040.36s -> 4064.07s]  Why? Why? What? It's cuz he's doing that move.
[4080.89s -> 4091.08s]  Oh, I can't see patchy from Spongebob. I beat everyone in the game on the first try and
[4091.08s -> 4117.13s]  you see like his cheap shit move that he has. Fucking believable.
[4137.53s -> 4150.63s]  No.
[4165.30s -> 4230.12s]  Get over here. No, fuck off. Just die.
[4230.12s -> 4273.22s]  No, fuck. Just use it.
[4282.76s -> 4304.58s]  Bomb. I win. I win. I win. Eat shit. Fuck that pirate guy. Hope your boat flips over
[4304.58s -> 4316.33s]  and flapjack. Oh, that's not even the last boss I forgot. Oh, right. It's this guy.
[4316.33s -> 4341.14s]  All right, let's go. Oops. Oh, he does so much damage.
[4358.81s -> 4383.51s]  Damn it, I didn't get him. Oh, damn it. Holy shit, he's insane. He does like two
[4383.51s -> 4411.40s]  and a half bars a hit. This is bad. I don't know what the hell he does.
[4450.55s -> 4471.51s]  Bad placement. That move. Oh my god. Give it here. Give it here. Give it here.
[4472.07s -> 4528.78s]  Give me that. Oh, Fafn is my real name. What the hell was that? Like, like, what happened?
[4550.33s -> 4550.81s]  Oh shit.
[4564.31s -> 4570.10s]  Damn it. I had to. Oh, what was that bounce off the wall? That bounce off the wall. The
[4570.74s -> 4579.40s]  sucked into his body like a fucking vacuum. Give me the third one right now. Over here.
[4579.40s -> 4606.02s]  Give me a good spawn. Get the fuck out of here. Come on, one more.
[4663.16s -> 4667.53s]  That bomb.
[4668.41s -> 4695.90s]  Just tap him. Just tap him.
[4699.18s -> 4709.74s]  Don't fucking throw it. I can't. I just got like, comboed. No way. Impossible.
[4715.86s -> 4719.38s]  I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I got six.
[4719.70s -> 4720.18s]  What?
[4752.60s -> 4756.28s]  Fuck you. You want to get flawless, dickhead? Is that what you want to have happen?
[4758.26s -> 4760.90s]  You want to get flawlessed after that bullshit?
[4773.94s -> 4791.66s]  Fucking god, I can't believe it. I can't fucking believe it. I had one hit.
[4792.71s -> 4800.79s]  My god, one more shit. That's such dog shit. Dude, literally took me six health. Oh, I am.
[4800.79s -> 4807.54s]  This is the maddest I've ever been in a video game in my entire life, I think. That's
[4807.54s -> 4815.74s]  un-fucking-believable. He did almost six full health bars in like two different, I'm so mad.
[4816.78s -> 4827.56s]  That's unbelievable. That is so fucking ridiculous.
[4828.04s -> 4832.52s]  Just kill me. Do two moves and kill me, final boss.
[4834.52s -> 4839.88s]  I got sloppy. I didn't get sloppy. I got unlucky.
[4841.32s -> 4845.56s]  Because I did my move and you have two or three seconds after your move is done.
[4845.56s -> 4849.16s]  For him to go do a bunch of fucking, set up a bunch of mouse traps for me.
[4850.28s -> 4867.42s]  Want to get flawlessed. Yeah. But don't worry. He just had to do two moves to do four.
[4867.42s -> 4875.83s]  Oh, I hate that. Dude, I understand like you give a final boss and you make it stronger and shit,
[4875.83s -> 4880.55s]  but like does he have to be like three or four times stronger? You know what I mean? Why?
[4881.59s -> 4885.42s]  Does he have to do like four times your damage? What the hell is that?
[4885.42s -> 4904.58s]  Who's made up that? No, it's very doable. I'm just hyper tilted right now.
[4911.18s -> 4914.06s]  It's like you gotta, you gotta beat the last boss three times. He's got like,
[4914.06s -> 4919.77s]  why even have the health bar here? Why don't you give him like, like five more health bars?
[4928.09s -> 4932.17s]  All right, this is the one. This is the one. Let me, let me beat the boss three times in a row.
[4933.13s -> 4935.45s]  And then win.
[4959.61s -> 4971.93s]  Oh my god. Why did I do that? Just kill me again.
[4972.17s -> 5013.32s]  God damn it. Just kill me. I'll try one more.
[5028.78s -> 5041.86s]  Fast. Okay. It's almost, look at the bars. Look at the top left bars.
[5041.86s -> 5045.22s]  He landed on his stomach and took 60% of my health pool.
[5045.22s -> 5054.25s]  Oh, I can't fucking believe it. You should, I should be embarrassed
[5055.05s -> 5057.85s]  because this motherfucker was dead almost twice in a row.
[5089.82s -> 5111.77s]  He's gonna get it because they spawned right in front of him. That's unbelievable.
[5190.09s -> 5203.32s]  Why didn't you, why didn't you, uh, I gotta go back to the character I played before.
[5209.78s -> 5222.15s]  Try. Let's do the roll.
[5227.19s -> 5227.99s]  No, that's pretty good.
[5230.54s -> 5238.76s]  Okay.
[5246.58s -> 5263.62s]  No, I have to beat this. This game is really good. I'm just salty at the last unfair boss.
[5264.98s -> 5290.98s]  This is like the Shao Kahn. Let me phrase it. This is, this is Mortal Kombat 1 Shao Kahn.
[5290.98s -> 5309.24s]  How did you, you're gonna jump up? Give me a fucking break. You're gonna jump over a goddamn fire?
[5310.76s -> 5324.20s]  What, what's the priority? Why did you get priority there? Oh my god. We both did this.
[5331.64s -> 5336.23s]  Still doable.
[5348.50s -> 5363.93s]  Christ.
[5388.17s -> 5392.49s]  He's gonna get it now. Fucking god, Jeremy, get out of here!
[5404.58s -> 5416.33s]  What the fuck was that?
[5434.10s -> 5434.60s]  Shit.
[5444.17s -> 5450.10s]  Yeah, another thing that somebody just said is true. Forget about like the awful gen squad.
[5451.30s -> 5455.46s]  It's like dodging and blocking something that I don't even know how to do it.
[5456.42s -> 5459.94s]  I don't, can I, is it even, I don't remember it being the game.
[5461.46s -> 5467.96s]  What's like the dodge? How do you do it? Is it possible in a certain fucking combination?
[5474.58s -> 5479.51s]  Because then, that's, sometimes you can reverse him.
[5485.77s -> 5488.47s]  I don't think it exists.
[5502.65s -> 5505.21s]  You have to jump or press a direction at perfect timing. Okay.
[5513.30s -> 5514.26s]  Am I getting baited here?
[5517.54s -> 5519.05s]  I think I'm getting baited.
[5519.05s -> 5526.07s]  Yeah, I just got baited.
[5533.16s -> 5536.98s]  I'm not timing it right.
[5545.42s -> 5554.38s]  I'm pretty sure I'm just getting fucked here. When you get hit.
[5554.86s -> 5608.66s]  No, I'm not gonna rage at Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk doesn't have a boss that has times 10 health and times 10 damage. It's a skateboarding move. It's faster.
[5619.22s -> 5635.00s]  It's so fucking sad to me because like I had it, I had it so close and then I just got
[5635.00s -> 5656.78s]  just bodied over and over again. I would have moved on to Tony Hawk by now. He's doing it. He's just so perfect.
[5660.60s -> 5669.13s]  When you talk about like difficulty spikes, right? The entire game was breezed until the last two bosses.
[5669.77s -> 5673.77s]  Like what the fuck? When did this game come out? 2025?
[5679.27s -> 5684.70s]  Oh okay, I'm gonna like just hunker down the traffic. I'm just progressively getting worse
[5684.70s -> 5697.99s]  because I'm just exhausted trying to beat this fucking guy. All right, here we go.
[5839.78s -> 5852.97s]  Dude, he's like gluing to these items. No, why did I do that? Just shut up, Jeremy. Just beat him.
[5879.21s -> 5885.05s]  What? What? What? What? When did I lose the other one? What the fuck, man? What?
[5887.66s -> 5900.58s]  You gotta be kidding me. You have to be kidding me. There's no way. That was...
[5901.30s -> 5903.45s]  I don't care who you are, everybody knows I'm stupid.
[5905.21s -> 5913.11s]  Was. Just was. All right, I'm not going in the air ever again. I'm literally never
[5913.11s -> 5923.48s]  gonna jump in the air. Not one time. Never. I'm gonna do this to myself.
[5923.48s -> 5986.82s]  Oh, you don't.
[5986.82s -> 6046.36s]  Come on. God. He dodged.
[6079.86s -> 6102.92s]  Got some fucking RNG there, didn't I? God damn it.
[6107.51s -> 6142.14s]  No. God damn it. It's okay.
[6150.98s -> 6155.38s]  Somebody did mention he is like perfect dodging almost every one of my attacks.
[6155.38s -> 6166.28s]  Fuck me, man. It is so close. I mean, it's one thing to learn how to like properly
[6166.28s -> 6184.25s]  dodge every attack, but he's dodging almost every one. He's getting so many of these
[6184.33s -> 6189.13s]  rolls to the way they just appear behind him right next to him on top of him. It's like, come on.
[6192.94s -> 6198.39s]  And it takes so much to kill him. I might as well just restart. Try to get him.
[6198.39s -> 6213.90s]  I gotta dodge that at least. I keep getting caught every time.
[6217.32s -> 6234.49s]  He can get like, I have not even one bar.
[6247.26s -> 6268.98s]  I don't like this guy super.
[6273.02s -> 6289.69s]  Oh my. Just trying to get away from him and he's just...
[6293.69s -> 6297.21s]  He also has perfect sight of the gems when you're limited to what the game shows you.
[6298.01s -> 6303.42s]  Okay, I'm gonna try a different character. Maybe it's like time to roll on like this guy.
[6304.38s -> 6310.62s]  I don't even know. I'm here. I have to be here.
[6310.94s -> 6319.45s]  Are you ready?
[6381.26s -> 6388.23s]  Flamethrower is honestly the best thing to ever use. It's going to him.
[6388.87s -> 6391.35s]  Just only run around until you get a flamethrower.
[6397.43s -> 6408.15s]  Exhibit A. There it is. I will cheese the fuck out of this guy. Do you think I care?
[6412.97s -> 6413.37s]  Let's go.
[6433.78s -> 6435.90s]  No, he got the gun before I did!
[6440.78s -> 6441.98s]  He's too focused on it.
[6441.98s -> 6464.52s]  What? Oh my god. Fuck off.
[6473.10s -> 6475.58s]  I don't know if I have enough health to do it. I think it's gonna be perfect.
[6503.75s -> 6508.15s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. It like bounced and he was gonna get it regardless.
[6508.15s -> 6511.19s]  Oh my god. It's such bullshit. It really is.
[6548.38s -> 6550.30s]  What happened? What the fuck was that?
[6560.30s -> 6571.74s]  Fucking kidding me, man. That's... This is so stupid. That actually is dumb. That's really dumb.
[6571.74s -> 6628.68s]  Just live. Live. Three. Two. One. Don't do it. That's it. What?
[6681.48s -> 6688.84s]  I love how I got the power stone. He did more damage than I did.
[6695.42s -> 6695.82s]  Fuck you.
[6708.07s -> 6711.75s]  But like I can't move during that. He gets a free hit every fucking time.
[6738.28s -> 6743.37s]  Oh my god.
[6766.50s -> 6768.34s]  Come on. Come on.
[6793.38s -> 6802.42s]  See what I'm talking about? He gets a free fucking hit.
[6821.48s -> 6824.28s]  I freaked out. It's okay.
[6825.08s -> 6828.36s]  Don't spawn over there.
[6843.94s -> 6848.90s]  Fucking stupid idiot. Why would you even pick up an item for no reason? He's so much faster than
[6848.90s -> 6855.54s]  you. There's no reason to do what I just did. Like unbelievable. I thought it was like a gun
[6855.54s -> 6859.94s]  or something. He is so unbearably difficult. Like why wouldn't you just...
[6886.34s -> 6904.71s]  Fucking god, I hate this.
[6907.90s -> 6922.20s]  I can't fucking believe it, man. I just... I still got it. My hands are like literally sweating.
[6926.14s -> 6933.74s]  Where's the other one?
[6964.54s -> 6967.26s]  I did it. I had to have won. I had to have won.
[6971.56s -> 6973.32s]  I did it. I win. I win the game. I'm done.
[7002.14s -> 7010.54s]  I don't know what. What? What the fuck was that? I couldn't even do anything.
[7013.54s -> 7031.83s]  What? Give me the stone.
[7036.92s -> 7075.46s]  It's very... Okay, it's very possible. Oh my god. Give it to me. Do I get to do this again?
[7076.10s -> 7082.34s]  I have... This is not even as bad. This is like the jokey end of the game. I mean it's
[7082.34s -> 7090.90s]  horrible. Yeah, thank god. All right, let's go. Let me beat Akira. There's no dodging that.
[7090.90s -> 7099.16s]  He just has to take a whole painful hit. I'm trying to dodge these.
[7106.97s -> 7108.25s]  I don't even sure if I can.
[7119.26s -> 7123.50s]  Dodge roll? I don't know if it's possible because it's not technically an attack.
[7124.46s -> 7126.06s]  It's kind of just a big thing with attacks.
[7131.16s -> 7137.66s]  Try jumping over them? You lose speed when you jump.
[7155.90s -> 7156.54s]  One second.
[7156.54s -> 7178.09s]  Don't go behind him. Well, he wasn't... There was only behind him.
[7189.62s -> 7203.93s]  Watch out. Shit. I'm behind him. I'm behind him. I'm looking for like...
[7203.93s -> 7206.49s]  Oh my god. That's un-dodgeable. Just never be...
[7219.59s -> 7222.55s]  Actually, he doesn't no matter what. I think it's just random number generator.
[7223.35s -> 7289.59s]  Oh, god damn it. How much health do I have? No, god. Timer. Oh, man.
[7293.32s -> 7298.55s]  I just spent... That's what I thought. It was a bad idea.
[7301.45s -> 7307.56s]  I'll get it. I mean, this is... I hate everything about this, but I'm going to beat it.
[7309.82s -> 7326.57s]  I have like another move that's like a... I think I'm actually really just going to use it
[7326.57s -> 7338.73s]  like this and then run if I collect the stones. I'm not even sure if I pick up the stones.
[7340.09s -> 7345.94s]  It's a waste of time because you just set yourself up for getting your ass kicked.
[7346.90s -> 7352.90s]  It's just so vulnerable. I pick up items. He's doing more damage than I just did.
[7354.74s -> 7386.39s]  He's done with his dip. Show. I'll take it. Sword. End it with sword.
[7391.77s -> 7392.64s]  Game over.
[7395.58s -> 7407.75s]  Oh, that was hell. For the Chaos Emerald.
[7408.23s -> 7413.64s]  He doesn't need it. He shatters it.
[7422.01s -> 7422.81s]  Worst ending.
[7434.39s -> 7435.99s]  Yeah, that was like the world's going.
[7441.51s -> 7445.69s]  Was the ending worth it? I had to do it because internally,
[7445.69s -> 7464.87s]  if I stopped at that last boss, I would have been so unfulfilled. My reputation would have been
[7464.87s -> 7480.33s]  ruined. Mrs. Space, thanks for 10 community subs. Thank you so much, Mrs. Space. 10 community
[7480.33s -> 7497.16s]  subs. Okay, there's the Infinity Gauntlet. Game over. The end? Please wait. A new feature
[7497.16s -> 7504.23s]  has been added. Would you like to save now? Yes, sure. Do all endings? I don't think I
[7504.23s -> 7518.04s]  can handle it. What's the new feature? Extra options. Game options. Oh, wow. Now I can
[7518.04s -> 7527.85s]  set how many power stones you have to get. Extra items. Damage recovery. I can fuck around
[7527.85s -> 7537.61s]  with these. Game options. We are like bright. There's no way I'm going to make anything
[7537.61s -> 7558.79s]  harder than this. Beat the game on easy. No. What else is there? Anything else?
[7559.91s -> 7571.93s]  I just want to see something. So how do you unlock it? Do I not unlock it? How do I unlock
[7571.93s -> 7577.40s]  the other characters? Next? Now hold on. Wait, hold on. I know. I'm not going to do the
[7577.40s -> 7588.95s]  whole thing. I have to beat the game with every character to unlock it. You have to
[7588.95s -> 7593.51s]  beat the game without using continues. That's not even a joke. Holy shit.
[7596.39s -> 7602.78s]  No. You have to look under the...
[7606.94s -> 7610.39s]  This game is really, really fun, though. Especially when you play it with more than
[7610.39s -> 7615.30s]  one person. Which one are you? I'm the one that's currently getting...
[7625.37s -> 7631.35s]  Yeah. I mean, it's just that last block. It's just like, come on. What the hell
[7631.35s -> 7640.15s]  was that nonsense? Times three damage, times five dodge, times five health. Like,
[7640.15s -> 7650.50s]  it's just, it's just accurate. I have a skin. Default skin.
[7653.86s -> 7664.97s]  But it is very good. Forget about my final boss complaints. This is Final Smash.
[7665.77s -> 7671.93s]  The video game, essentially. It's very, very good. Did I say the game sucks at
[7671.93s -> 7675.45s]  all? I don't think it did. When I was, like, in the middle of that meltdown where I was
[7675.45s -> 7678.97s]  getting destroyed by the black ball. I didn't say the game sucked, did I?
[7686.98s -> 7698.78s]  Well, that move is amazing. Did it beat the boss? I did. I beat the two bosses. I did.
[7698.78s -> 7704.30s]  Okay, good. Good. Because I don't believe that. Whatever my frustrated mind would say,
[7704.30s -> 7705.66s]  I don't believe that. It was actually very good.
[7716.39s -> 7728.18s]  But I beat Valgus, but Fluggin Brothers is too hard. All right, we got, I played,
[7728.18s -> 7730.82s]  this is kind of what I figured was gonna happen. I was gonna play something like
[7730.82s -> 7736.79s]  Power Stone for a couple of hours. It's so fun. Fuck that final boss.
[7742.70s -> 7749.91s]  So we're gonna move on from here. I have Tony Hawk.
[7750.63s -> 7763.05s]  I also have a survival horror game called Carrier. Because if I put in Tony Hawk,
[7763.05s -> 7773.96s]  I'm gonna play Tony Hawk for the rest of the night. So we gotta get
[7774.68s -> 7778.82s]  some of these other ones out of the way. So just give me one sec.
[7779.38s -> 7789.54s]  Okay, I just opened the case and the glass shattered. Like three chunks of glass just,
[7789.54s -> 7795.26s]  like, shot up over here. I didn't, I just opened it. I just opened the glass.
[7795.26s -> 7802.31s]  I opened the case. I gotta be careful. I gotta pick this shit up. Hold on.
[7802.95s -> 7809.10s]  Because that will be bad. It's like sharp. It's not glass. It's that like super sharp
[7809.10s -> 7818.76s]  plastic bullshit. Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure is on PC. So I'm gonna do those
[7818.76s -> 7824.90s]  at a different day. The games I'm doing today are the games that are not available
[7824.90s -> 7830.98s]  anywhere else. Only on Dreamcast. The actual console. Can't, they weren't ported, etc.
[7831.70s -> 7842.10s]  I have all of them. Shenmue is another one. Shenmue, I had an option to get it on
[7842.10s -> 7852.26s]  Dreamcast, but not even last year. They ported the game to PC and they upscaled it to like 1080,
[7852.26s -> 7859.94s]  right? Tony Hawk is on PC. Tony Hawk 2 is not on PC. They did like a remaster of Tony Hawk 1,
[7859.94s -> 7867.10s]  and it was kind of lukewarm. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is not on PC. It's only on the
[7867.18s -> 7892.52s]  consoles. I mean, yes it is. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is on PC. What? Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 PC?
[7898.54s -> 7903.58s]  Oh, but it's an, okay, it's an old Windows game. And you know how hellish it can be
[7903.58s -> 7912.09s]  sometimes to get those to run. I guess it is on PC. Does it actually work on like Windows 10?
[7919.10s -> 7933.06s]  All right, here's carrier. It doesn't work on Windows 10. Just get a virtual box. Yeah,
[7933.06s -> 7938.82s]  but if I already have a Dreamcast here, do I really want to make like a virtual emulation
[7938.82s -> 7943.06s]  machine to play Tony Hawk 2 when I already have it here and this is arguably the best version
[7943.06s -> 7952.36s]  is the one on Dreamcast? Why is there somebody's, somebody has a website in the corner.
[7957.10s -> 7966.49s]  Why? Why did they shoot us down? Leonard, Lieutenant Manning. Am I the only one that made
[7966.49s -> 7978.94s]  it? Is that Leonard? So the opening, I didn't press start yet though. That's like the demo
[7978.94s -> 7992.87s]  screen. Carrier. Everybody did the Resident Evil. When you press start, it says the name.
[7995.54s -> 8010.10s]  Whatever, let's just go. By the beginning of the 21st century, the North-South conflict had
[8010.10s -> 8015.14s]  escalated to military confrontation. Which North-South? The people of the countries of the South
[8015.14s -> 8019.86s]  faced with an energy crisis and a food shortage had developed a deep-seated hatred.
[8019.86s -> 8024.66s]  Is this just generic country names? And as a result, anti-North terrorist groups began to show up
[8024.66s -> 8030.01s]  all over the world. In response, the countries of the North joined together to create the
[8030.01s -> 8036.33s]  Northern Hemisphere Treaty Alliance, NTA. The goal of this organization was to stop the
[8036.33s -> 8043.69s]  Southern terrorists. In 2023, the NTA completed construction of the Heimdall aircraft carrier.
[8044.33s -> 8048.49s]  With its stage defense system and connection to the satellite defense system,
[8048.49s -> 8053.53s]  the Heimdall is like a steel wall, invulnerable to any sort of air-based attack.
[8054.49s -> 8059.05s]  The first mission for the Heimdall was to attack the base of the Southern Cross terrorist group.
[8059.69s -> 8064.97s]  This was called the Hurricane Mission. During an attack that lasted only a few days,
[8064.97s -> 8069.37s]  the base was completely destroyed and the Heimdall was able to head back to its home
[8069.37s -> 8075.77s]  port in North America. However, approximately two days of travel from port, the Heimdall fell
[8075.77s -> 8082.73s]  silent, failing to respond to any communication from NTA. Concerned about the Heimdall,
[8082.73s -> 8086.81s]  a Spark investigation team was put together and sent to determine what happened.
[8130.76s -> 8132.60s]  Oh boy.
[8137.46s -> 8142.18s]  That was a full, almost three seconds of no-lips-and-mouth.
[8161.40s -> 8165.83s]  Somebody turn the vacuum off, I want to hear the dialogue please.
[8167.75s -> 8171.34s]  I don't see anyone on the flight.
[8171.34s -> 8175.02s]  Dad is mowing the lawn right next to your window and you're in a goddamn
[8175.02s -> 8181.99s]  intense 3D3 League of Legends match and you're getting so irritated. He goes away,
[8181.99s -> 8191.02s]  he's on his fucking riding mower and he's driving away and you're gonna mute your fucking
[8191.02s -> 8198.82s]  mic. Mute. Oh, here we go. It goes by you unmute your friends, dad.
[8198.82s -> 8218.87s]  He couldn't hear anything I was saying. Well, case in point, good. I'm glad the game
[8218.87s -> 8231.72s]  would make the point. I'm happy to give this game about 25 minutes.
[8235.26s -> 8239.99s]  You just tried to tell a joke with your dad mowing the lawn. Yes, I, exactly.
[8240.79s -> 8247.14s]  This is the maddest I've ever been. This is the maddest I've ever been in a video game.
[8248.33s -> 8250.73s]  Stupid, it's stupid. This game's fucking stupid.
[8268.33s -> 8271.88s]  Leonard. So we're gonna get the big reveal to see what happened to Leonard.
[8279.03s -> 8284.18s]  Are you okay? No, he's okay. Hang on. Looks like my leg's no good.
[8286.02s -> 8292.33s]  Your leg? Don't move it. I'll take care of it. This is Colonel Burke.
[8292.33s -> 8297.32s]  Smart team, do you copy? Colonel Burke. Those goggles. Jack, you're a bit late.
[8297.32s -> 8301.64s]  He won't do anything. Have you finally landed? Colonel, the helicopter was attacked.
[8302.36s -> 8308.54s]  What? Colonel, the helicopter was attacked. So that was the big point.
[8308.54s -> 8311.34s]  He has giant ski goggles on. It must be the work of Southern Cross.
[8312.06s -> 8315.82s]  We don't know about that. We must begin the investigation.
[8316.38s -> 8320.94s]  And the other members? Are they okay? I don't know where Lieutenant Manning is.
[8320.94s -> 8325.82s]  She's disappeared. The pilot Leonard is with me now, but he's badly injured.
[8325.82s -> 8330.30s]  I see. See if you can find a first aid kit and do what you can for Leonard.
[8330.30s -> 8334.50s]  When you're done, begin your investigation. Yes, sir.
[8334.50s -> 8338.90s]  I don't know what's going on, but it's clear that things are not what they seem.
[8339.70s -> 8342.42s]  Maybe Leonard is safer than a flight. Make a Resident Evil 2 joke?
[8342.42s -> 8346.74s]  Yeah, I'll leave him here. I'll check the ship and bring back any first aid supplies.
[8346.74s -> 8348.02s]  I can't. I haven't played it.
[8348.02s -> 8351.94s]  I'm counting on you. We'll get back to the investigation on this end.
[8352.74s -> 8357.06s]  Lang should be checking the ship data in the security room. When you're done,
[8357.06s -> 8361.94s]  catch up with him and see what he's discovered. Then continue your investigation.
[8361.94s -> 8366.98s]  Yes, sir, Colonel. Be careful. Wait for me, Leonard. I'll get a first aid kit.
[8368.95s -> 8381.19s]  Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be right back. Apologizing. Okay.
[8382.07s -> 8394.58s]  Do I have control of the character now? Is this going to be another tank controls game?
[8395.54s -> 8400.02s]  We just walk around and shoot the one zombie that shows up and then grab the health kit.
[8401.14s -> 8431.54s]  I'm glad we're getting it out of the way. No scream. What happened?
[8432.10s -> 8436.44s]  It's his head.
[8445.54s -> 8449.40s]  His head? Oh, no. Okay.
[8452.06s -> 8470.66s]  So let's plug us. I love that bird mouth.
[8472.79s -> 8483.26s]  What the hell's going on? Leonard was by that. Please work.
[8497.22s -> 8501.32s]  Leonard, I'm sorry. I wish I could have done something.
[8502.65s -> 8507.14s]  The eyes shifting back and forth. All right. Time for.
[8512.57s -> 8523.10s]  What the hell is going on here? How do I? Okay. How do I shoot?
[8525.67s -> 8567.32s]  Hey, dead. Yeah, it's just tank controls. Actually, not that bad. All right. Upstairs.
[8573.08s -> 8580.31s]  Dollar store of Resident Evil. Well, more like $2 store or 30 or $40 on Amazon store.
[8581.96s -> 8586.94s]  At least 10. This was at least $10 in the Amazon dollar store.
[8595.38s -> 8610.54s]  Port side elevator. That's an impractically not long name for a store.
[8613.40s -> 8619.18s]  Raided. We got a raid. What? Who came in with the raid?
[8635.08s -> 8647.26s]  I see General Sam. General Sam, thanks for the raid. Welcome, everybody. General Sam.
[8651.30s -> 8655.78s]  Of those of you that are just joining us, this game, this is not something that you're
[8655.78s -> 8659.30s]  typically going to see on this channel. It's not a good representation. Yes, it is.
[8660.28s -> 8662.36s]  Welcome to the stream. Hope you had a good one, General Sam.
[8663.24s -> 8670.07s]  This is not a good representation of what the stream is.
[8671.03s -> 8681.08s]  It's usually not. I'm usually not playing a game like this. Usually I'm playing Dota 2 or
[8684.38s -> 8687.90s]  cards in real life. Just cards, playing cards with a friend.
[8689.82s -> 8702.87s]  A3 lock is written above the key slot. Okay, go down here. Look at how dark this is.
[8702.87s -> 8715.22s]  What does it say? Deck 1 security room and medical. A1 written on the lock.
[8715.94s -> 8727.70s]  Okay, slow down. It's just blue stinger, but slightly better. Yep, hold on.
[8740.30s -> 8742.06s]  Such passion. Such fear.
[8747.90s -> 8752.06s]  Somebody knocked on your hotel door and you walked up and asked that question.
[8777.90s -> 8779.98s]  We don't figure out what's going on soon.
[8781.10s -> 8786.38s]  Anyway, the Colonel's on deck three. Dr. Noble should be on his way to the lower decks,
[8786.38s -> 8790.54s]  but I haven't heard from him for now. We need to join the Colonel.
[8790.54s -> 8796.22s]  Yes, sir. I'm trying to open the partition to deck two, but I need two more activation discs.
[8797.58s -> 8801.34s]  There are two more discs like this one on deck one, some old, old,
[8801.34s -> 8807.90s]  old. Stupid. Where's the thumb drive? Stupid dumb old game. Where's the thumb drive, idiot?
[8809.35s -> 8813.67s]  Right? Yes, sir. There should be an ID card in the medical room in this area.
[8814.23s -> 8818.31s]  Here, take this. You should stock up on medicines in case of an emergency.
[8818.87s -> 8839.70s]  Yes, sir. This computer's running wild. It won't tell me anything about the ship.
[8840.26s -> 8845.78s]  The security lock is complicated. What a pain. You better bring those discs soon.
[8845.78s -> 8853.13s]  There's not much time. Somebody just said I missed the kind old lady,
[8853.13s -> 8857.37s]  Jerma. What? No, I've read that completely wrong. The old Jerma that used to walk
[8857.37s -> 8868.04s]  old ladies across the street. When did I do that? Does this do anything? Do you want to...
[8868.04s -> 8874.54s]  No. There's something over here. A security system console seems to be active. There's a
[8874.54s -> 8884.09s]  something spinning around over there. Just... that's it. A A3 ID card obtained and
[8884.09s -> 8891.56s]  DV tape obtained. That's how you know this is old. Doesn't help old ladies? Of course I do.
[8892.52s -> 8895.16s]  If I'm on the sidewalk and an old lady comes up and she says,
[8895.16s -> 8902.23s]  Ah, excuse me. Could I please add bother you? I say, yes, of course. What's... what is it, man?
[8903.11s -> 8909.11s]  I'm looking to go across this walkway here and I need a little bit of help.
[8909.83s -> 8915.27s]  I go, absolutely, ma'am. Of course. And we get to the end and we slowly go across and make
[8915.27s -> 8921.03s]  sure that, you know, she's stabilized and has enough room to go. We get across and
[8921.03s -> 8925.67s]  she gives like a little a little hug like, Oh, thank you, my my wonderful boy. And you're like,
[8925.67s -> 8930.15s]  Oh, have a great day, ma'am. And then like two or three hours later, you go into your wallet
[8930.15s -> 8934.79s]  because you're buying a drink. You're buying a round for all your friends. And like 60 bucks
[8934.79s -> 8958.73s]  is gone. That's why I don't do it. What the fuck is going on in here? What happened?
[8959.45s -> 8960.73s]  For a second, I saw a dinosaur face.
[8966.87s -> 8968.41s]  Here comes the scientist.
[8970.49s -> 8971.85s]  Then here's the fucked up scientist.
[8971.85s -> 8977.37s]  I'm Sergeant Ingles. I'm part of the Spark team sent to investigate the ship. What are you doing
[8977.37s -> 8985.83s]  here? Spark? You're a little too late. This is not a human anymore. Here, take a look with this.
[8986.87s -> 8998.09s]  What is it? VR goggles. Okay, the BEM T3N scope. Developed by the NTA for infantry in the
[8998.09s -> 9003.05s]  case of biological warfare, can be used to identify non-human life forms. See in the
[9003.05s -> 9012.34s]  dark and see through some objects. Do I really have to scan this guy to find out that he's a
[9012.34s -> 9027.77s]  zombie? Scanning. Danger. What's going on? What is going on? What you see? Somebody gave 50
[9027.77s -> 9038.65s]  dollars a long time ago. What? How did I miss this? I was finally able to capture one of
[9039.21s -> 9044.81s]  these things alive and conduct some experiments, but the ship is already full of them.
[9045.69s -> 9050.57s]  What? I tried to analyze this one, but it's too late. I was getting my ass kicked.
[9052.09s -> 9060.49s]  Oh, that's right. I was engrossed in self-pity playing Power Stone. Hey, what are you doing?
[9061.45s -> 9072.15s]  It, it is all because of Ark. Ark? This monster looks like a human, but, but it's not. It's
[9072.15s -> 9081.53s]  an inferior life form. Hey, stop. Are you crazy? I thought I just shot him.
[9085.94s -> 9088.50s]  Those bombs, those chains were not bound very well. Like,
[9088.98s -> 9107.66s]  human. He's dead. Three, two, one. You're a very bad shot. You're terrible. Hey, wait,
[9107.66s -> 9117.19s]  what are you talking about? He can fit like four times. You have arrived in hell.
[9127.10s -> 9137.67s]  He did the, okay. Well, I wasn't really ready for that.
[9138.55s -> 9149.99s]  Okay, that, am I stuck in a time loop here? Why did he just reverse time?
[9153.72s -> 9161.24s]  Uh, A1 ID card. I needed that. Anything else in the room? There it is. Record of research
[9161.96s -> 9173.70s]  by Terry Adams. Somebody else. What? Carrots? What just fell out?
[9176.09s -> 9187.06s]  An evil carrot just jumped out at me. What? There's more? More Nickelodeon Splat sound
[9187.06s -> 9206.58s]  effects, too. If you keep them scored. Can I please shoot this? If I die to the
[9206.58s -> 9221.37s]  fucking Nickelodeon carrot, I'm gonna be very upset. Okay. Nothing, there's nothing useful here.
[9222.09s -> 9237.93s]  So let's go. I got the A1 card. Do I have any healing items? A1 is down this way.
[9243.35s -> 9252.50s]  Use energy drink. Yep, use it. That's not very much health. All right, equip, uh, where's
[9252.50s -> 9267.14s]  my, is my helmet? No, don't welder. Look. Okay, use it. Just turned everything kind of sepia. Uh oh.
[9276.42s -> 9280.18s]  At least there are enemies in this game. The last two survival horror games we played,
[9281.72s -> 9296.54s]  people barely had to, there was no enemies. All right, what's in here? Let's find out.
[9296.54s -> 9303.93s]  Which ones were survival horror? Uh, the ring. The ring was one of them. What? Then blue stinger.
[9304.81s -> 9317.18s]  That's not even a survival horror. Hoygel was horror, maybe. Everything's covered with plants.
[9322.78s -> 9333.37s]  The bird? Okay, this is a jump scare. There's an octopus giant plant octopus thing in here.
[9344.15s -> 9350.07s]  Yes, I'm checking the aircraft hangars. The wavelengths aren't even matched up either.
[9351.03s -> 9356.63s]  Leonard? Well, at least match up the wavelengths. He was attacked and killed by some creature on
[9356.63s -> 9363.35s]  the flight deck. What? I couldn't get to him in time. I'm so sorry. No, there's nothing to
[9363.35s -> 9378.39s]  object about. Colonel. Sorry, this is no time to get emotional. Yes, sir. He came down and
[9378.39s -> 9385.93s]  attacked me, so I killed it. Stop using your voice. The elevator was damaged, so I couldn't
[9385.93s -> 9390.01s]  go up and check until I went below. It was just me and Leonard on the flight deck.
[9390.81s -> 9394.09s]  I don't know we're the creature that attacked Leonard. Just start humming it in your head
[9394.09s -> 9399.53s]  because it's going to come soon enough. There's no sense for fussing and fighting, my friend.
[9402.73s -> 9405.53s]  Yes, sir. Do you have any idea what's going on?
[9407.61s -> 9422.58s]  I saw a human turn into some sort of monster. I don't know. Let's do it. Yes, sir.
[9423.56s -> 9426.12s]  What happened to the creature that attacked you? It came down and attacked me.
[9427.00s -> 9457.80s]  All right, we're going speed run. One death, permanent death. Head gone. Perfect. Nothing
[9457.80s -> 9471.02s]  over here. Another cut scene. Radio room. This thing's going to jump up. Hey, what do
[9471.02s -> 9476.62s]  you think you're doing? I'm too late. Heimdall, why did you attack the Spark
[9476.62s -> 9485.32s]  helicopter of NTA Central? He thought that guy was alive. Deactivate the intercept system
[9485.32s -> 9498.63s]  and stop the ship. He's angry at that guy. Heimdall, respond. Stop the ship.
[9498.63s -> 9504.22s]  This is Sergeant Ingalls from Spark. Spark, okay. Our helicopter was destroyed during
[9504.22s -> 9512.23s]  an emergency landing. Stop. Hey, what the hell went on? Over here in Chicago,
[9512.95s -> 9528.76s]  what's going on? We're calling from a long ways away. Damn. That was the essentially all
[9528.76s -> 9542.60s]  that guy's dialogue. Nothing in here that I can need to grab or touch or do.
[9543.70s -> 9546.66s]  Dead body in the chair. He must have been attacked while using the transmitter. Okay.
[9546.90s -> 9567.85s]  Muzzle flash just flashed light, you're right. But, all right, let's see. There's a door over
[9567.85s -> 9590.36s]  this way. No, that's just the way I came. I gotta go till you die. What if I just don't
[9590.36s -> 9602.54s]  die? That would be really unfortunate for all of us. Who are you? What? I'm Sergeant Ingalls.
[9602.54s -> 9607.26s]  I'm part of the Spark team sent by NTA. Man, you were lucky to make it this far.
[9607.26s -> 9610.22s]  Was the intercept system deactivated? How's he going to shoot this guy? No, it destroyed the
[9610.22s -> 9617.03s]  helicopter we came in on. It's hopeless. It's impossible to leave. Don't give up. We'll
[9617.03s -> 9622.31s]  deactivate the system somehow. Do you know where it is? Man, it's in the weapons control
[9622.31s -> 9627.67s]  room on deck six, but it's going to be hell to get there. Trust me, we'll get there.
[9627.67s -> 9630.79s]  Evacuate to the flight deck and wait for help from the command center. He's got a good
[9630.79s -> 9634.55s]  YouTuber voice. Hey, we're counting on you, Sarge. This should come in handy in your
[9634.55s -> 9655.82s]  mission. Yeah, it does. It's the second one. That's what I needed. Can't do it. Let's go.
[9656.62s -> 9664.34s]  How do I find these games? Well, this is just on Dreamcast. This is only on Dreamcast.
[9665.83s -> 9671.37s]  And the last couple of nights we've been playing Dreamcast games. It's the most defining,
[9674.01s -> 9692.89s]  genre-defining even. Video games came from the Dreamcast, and we're seeing why. What? He
[9692.89s -> 9699.99s]  went right for the neck. Iron Gate. Looks like it would take a bomb to open it. It's locked. A2.
[9706.87s -> 9715.32s]  This might end very quickly. Is there another door?
[9720.33s -> 9724.33s]  People act like PS2 didn't have bad games. No, Dreamcast has a lot of great games.
[9727.72s -> 9740.73s]  Pull the door. I went all the way to the end. Look at this great game. Well, this is not a
[9740.73s -> 9762.54s]  look at this great game. This is look at this exclusive. Go this way. Well, I've only
[9762.54s -> 9768.30s]  played the bad ones. Well, because all the good ones are ported to PC. So stuff like Shenmue is
[9768.30s -> 9777.06s]  just a better version on PC. Jet Set Radio is on PC. Sonic Adventure is on PC. Space Channel 5 is
[9777.06s -> 9782.34s]  on PC. And those games are a lot of money. So I got the ports for those ones, and then we're
[9782.34s -> 9787.38s]  going to play them. But these are the physical disks that you can't get anywhere else unless
[9787.38s -> 9794.71s]  you emulate these games. Space Channel 5, yeah, is on PC. I didn't I was completely unaware of
[9794.71s -> 9801.83s]  that as well. I was shocked when I saw like the actual Dreamcast collection on Steam. It's on
[9801.83s -> 9816.31s]  Steam. Where was I back there? Yeah, Dreamcast Sonic Adventure is probably better. But I mean,
[9816.31s -> 9827.03s]  I can still get it. Let me go through this door. Sonic Adventure is actual dog shit if
[9827.03s -> 9837.34s]  you haven't played it recently. Now I'm scared. Hey, what happened? There's something over there.
[9837.90s -> 9839.43s]  Somebody hiding behind a locker?
[9843.91s -> 9858.50s]  What happened? Who is this? Is that me? I don't see anything. Did that guy run into the locker
[9858.50s -> 9864.15s]  and then the game delayed his fall down by 10 straight seconds? Or was he supposed to get
[9864.15s -> 9877.16s]  sucked in and grabbed into the locker? No, it's an invisible man. What? The scope.
[9879.77s -> 9895.16s]  Oh, he's going to use the infrared. Good. Don't use my bullets. I'll take care of it. You stay in
[9895.16s -> 9920.42s]  the locker. It's okay. You can come out. You're Jack, Bob's brother. You know Bob?
[9921.22s -> 9927.82s]  I know Bob. Yeah, he runs the dog stand down the fucking street. You must be Eddie from
[9927.82s -> 9937.40s]  Bob's outfit. You got it. I'm glad you're okay. Was Bob with you? I lost track of him when
[9937.40s -> 9946.25s]  the mutants came. Yeah, I lost track of Bob. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm glad to see you're
[9946.25s -> 9954.22s]  okay. It's not safe here. You should go to the flight deck. Okay. Be careful, Sergeant.
[9955.02s -> 9971.93s]  Thanks. Hurry. Yeah. Medkit, we still go. I go until I die.
[9974.34s -> 9985.35s]  We go until I... never mind. I thought about it for a second.
[9991.70s -> 10005.88s]  Use the heal. I have six shots left. Full stream of carrier incoming. I don't think that's
[10005.88s -> 10030.47s]  going to happen. R2? No, just run. The game doesn't look that bad. It is not that bad.
[10030.47s -> 10038.63s]  None of these games are that bad. These games came out before some of you guys were even
[10038.63s -> 10054.62s]  born. So you gotta give a little bit of credit. Just run. What's wrong with me?
[10056.47s -> 10062.74s]  Why did I just do that? Did I just puke? Did I just like shit my pants and say no?
[10084.55s -> 10092.81s]  It's you without a mustache. Who do I shoot? Who do I shoot? I made the right call.
[10092.81s -> 10105.61s]  It's a good thing you're able to figure it out. How you doing? I'm Alan. I'm Sergeant
[10105.61s -> 10110.81s]  Inglis from SPARC. I'm asking all survivors to go to the flight deck. You should go there
[10110.81s -> 10117.53s]  too. The flight deck? There are no safe places left on this here ship. Well,
[10117.53s -> 10122.81s]  you must have noticed by now the whole ship is screwed up, son. It's impossible to tell
[10122.81s -> 10129.53s]  who's on our side and who is not. You can't trust anyone but yourself. I hope it's facial
[10129.53s -> 10134.73s]  here. Thanks, but I'll make my own decisions. That's how you want it. Good luck. I've got
[10134.73s -> 10140.57s]  work to do. Be careful. You too. Here, you better take this. By the way, son,
[10141.13s -> 10148.33s]  thanks for saving my butt. Three energy drinks. Level three. No, level three energy
[10148.57s -> 10151.46s]  whatever it was. That's a full heal.
[10161.66s -> 10172.41s]  All right, what we got? Control panel. Is it ammo? What is it? Activation disc obtained.
[10174.74s -> 10207.64s]  For what room? Activation disc. I just healed too. Really? What is- oh, the invisible guys. I
[10207.64s -> 10227.56s]  forgot about the stupid invisibility bullshit. Excuse me. No other doors. There's one right
[10227.56s -> 10244.25s]  here. God damn it. Kill him. Everybody wants me to lose so bad. Everybody's rooting for me to
[10244.25s -> 10273.06s]  lose. This is spooky. Come on. All right, we got our first major encounter, I think. How's the
[10273.06s -> 10290.70s]  speed around looking? Somebody said this game hurts to look at. It is an old game.
[10291.34s -> 10320.38s]  Nothing over here. God damn tank. It has no lighting and zero art direction. It's kind of
[10320.38s -> 10328.20s]  a blob, isn't it? Is there a reason to come out here? There's a two-hour speedrun of this game.
[10330.22s -> 10340.26s]  How long is the game itself then? Two hours for a speedrun. This game's probably like 15
[10340.26s -> 10347.59s]  to 20 hours long. Well, I'm looking forward to it because there's no way I'm gonna die.
[10348.39s -> 10354.87s]  Well, then he dies when he gets up to the top of the ladder. Wouldn't that be funny?
[10367.99s -> 10376.31s]  All right, going up Shadow Moses. Wait till I get my codec call.
[10385.96s -> 10393.32s]  Sir, this is Jack. Sir, I'm on my way to the bridge. The partition for the corridor to deck
[10393.32s -> 10398.12s]  two is closed. Captain Lang is in the security room trying to open and I'm looking for the
[10398.12s -> 10426.78s]  necessary discs. E-7 bomb. Deck one weapon storage. Can't they just turn those lights on?
[10427.50s -> 10449.72s]  Is there a pair of underwear? No. Yeah, there was that door downstairs that needed a bomb.
[10450.36s -> 10465.46s]  That guy's gonna stand up after I grab the disc. Ship's log. That's a full month. Visibility's good
[10465.46s -> 10475.94s]  and the radar is still operating. We're gonna get a good view of the... Don't trust anybody.
[10475.94s -> 10497.02s]  Still raining. Doesn't look like it will stop soon. Okay. Well, like he was probably alive.
[10497.02s -> 10501.42s]  Well, I don't know. I saw a guy and had to shoot. If I get hit one more time, I'm dead.
[10506.60s -> 10519.35s]  Yeah, that's the... that's not the Wilhelm scream. That's called the tantrum scream.
[10520.73s -> 10533.78s]  Is that what it is? Stay away from me. Calm down. I'm part of the spark team. Spark team? Yeah,
[10533.78s -> 10538.34s]  we're evacuating survivors to the flight deck. This guy's a liar. Do you know
[10538.34s -> 10543.06s]  a pilot named Bob Ingalls? Bob? He's my brother. Shoot this guy. I think I've heard
[10543.06s -> 10547.94s]  the name somewhere, but... Hmm. You know, maybe if you check the crew list using the
[10547.94s -> 10552.50s]  terminal here, you'll find something. I see. I'll check it later. Do you know where the
[10552.50s -> 10570.89s]  weapon storage is? It is. Why? Why was that used in every form of media? Was it there as a
[10570.89s -> 10593.58s]  joke? It was just an inside joke. I'm not doing so hot. There we go. Energy drink.
[10593.58s -> 10608.28s]  Use energy drink. Look at that. I really had one HP. So I gotta go down to A... A2, right?
[10617.85s -> 10629.53s]  There's a map. Look at the map. Where's the map? Where's the map? A2 doors. I need like an A2 map.
[10633.45s -> 10637.45s]  No one's paying attention. No one's paying attention.
[10642.94s -> 10646.14s]  I actually... I don't think it's that bad. I think it's actually not bad.
[10657.11s -> 10665.70s]  It's the Tony Hawk waiting room. Don't you worry. I will show you a 1 million point string.
[10666.34s -> 10673.96s]  You understand? Now, I would like somebody to cut from what I just said right there.
[10674.68s -> 10679.40s]  About 30 minutes from now, potentially, when I am repeating over and over again.
[10680.20s -> 10686.62s]  It's fucking impossible. Like, it's very... It's stupid. In fact, overlay my voice. Ready?
[10686.62s -> 10693.35s]  I'll go for it. It's just the controls are fucking dumb. Like, I press the button,
[10693.35s -> 10702.82s]  it didn't do anything. Like, it just doesn't really hold up. Oh my fucking god. This is
[10702.82s -> 10712.17s]  so stupid. How? I clearly was grinding that rail. I just... It's so unbearable. Okay,
[10712.17s -> 10723.35s]  so I would like for you guys to clip that over. Just lay it on top of it.
[10723.35s -> 10744.63s]  Better actor than people in the game. Okay, I need door A2. What game is this? This is...
[10745.51s -> 10756.46s]  I can't... I gotta... Nope. How's that for a Tony Hawk rail grind? Oh yeah, here's another
[10756.46s -> 10760.78s]  great one. This is another classic. I'm sorry, guys. I just... I don't have it today. I just
[10760.78s -> 10764.86s]  don't... I don't have it. I'm gonna try this one more time and then we'll see what happens.
[10765.66s -> 10779.86s]  That's a classic, right? No, I need A2. Is that an A2 door right there? Oh,
[10779.86s -> 10788.46s]  the invisible guy. Shit. Do I have any more heals? I don't.
[10788.46s -> 10796.87s]  No, don't rip around that way. Go! Wasn't there a locked door like over here?
[10806.60s -> 10816.33s]  The map is in the menu. Pause menu. Oh, okay. Where the hell even am I? I don't know what deck
[10816.33s -> 10824.20s]  I'm on. Okay, I'm right there. So I gotta go... Ah, this is not even that bad of a game. It
[10824.20s -> 10835.66s]  just isn't. So I gotta go out and then through. Is that A2, though? Radio room. Main passageway.
[10835.66s -> 10847.56s]  So I gotta go down the hall and through the door on the left. So I'm in the wrong room.
[10847.56s -> 10854.52s]  But can I heal in here? All right, so it's the door on the left. I don't know if I'm
[10854.52s -> 10882.44s]  gonna make it through this door. Shit. Why is this not playing? I had to queue it up, too.
[10885.05s -> 10899.83s]  All right, let's get Tony Hawk rolling. This game is kind of cool. It was. It wasn't that bad.
[10899.83s -> 10903.99s]  It was... The game gave you those key cards and you just had to kind of see where the
[10903.99s -> 10908.39s]  doors were locked. It wasn't confusing. It was... If I gave a shit, I would probably sit
[10908.39s -> 10916.36s]  there and play it for a while. He's getting defensive about this sucky game. What? I think
[10916.36s -> 10924.07s]  it's fun. But this is what everybody came here for. The best version of Tony Hawk Pro
[10924.07s -> 10928.55s]  Skater 2, if you ask any expert in the industry, ask anybody in the field, you ask anybody in your
[10928.55s -> 10935.11s]  friend group, anybody that you know. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 for the Dreamcast is the best
[10935.11s -> 10942.97s]  version of the game. That is just a fact and we're about to play. Somebody just said wrong.
[10945.27s -> 10956.92s]  I don't know. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to disagree with you. And the disc is not in
[10956.92s -> 10963.70s]  here. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 inside here is actually... There's a mistake. The disc is
[10963.70s -> 10980.38s]  not in here. This is actually Shenmue 2 is in here. So I got scammed. Let's go put it in and
[10980.38s -> 10991.22s]  see what happens. All right, let's actually rename this Tony Hawk because I'm gonna be
[10991.22s -> 10998.34s]  here for a while because I love this game. This is no longer just a straight up Dreamcast
[10999.14s -> 11013.46s]  fuckface stream. This is now a Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 stream. And I'm looking forward to it
[11013.46s -> 11026.68s]  because it's a great game. Now the real stream begins. But I want to touch... Stormy Chu gave
[11026.68s -> 11032.36s]  $50 earlier and I need to address it because that's a lot of money. Pizza hut burgers taste
[11032.36s -> 11037.96s]  like boogies and you know it's true. Hungry Howies is superior in every way. Also need
[11037.96s -> 11040.92s]  to remind you that you're the best streamer and can always make me and Chad have a good
[11040.92s -> 11049.16s]  laugh. That's good. Thank you. I've never heard of Hungry Howies. I don't know where that is.
[11050.70s -> 11056.46s]  By the way, Rip Vod is a rest in peace to the Vod. But I'm not going to turn the music
[11056.46s -> 11063.06s]  off in this game because it's one of the major parts to play it. So sorry.
[11066.07s -> 11077.42s]  This is the best Tony Hawk. This is the classic. It's the best. They will never make
[11077.42s -> 11083.29s]  a better skating game than Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. And everyone that wants to argue
[11083.29s -> 11087.86s]  what about Skate 3? Well, I've never played it. So I've heard it was okay.
[11089.14s -> 11106.30s]  All right. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. Let's get some stuff going here. I could create a...
[11106.30s -> 11109.58s]  If I could... Want me to do like a full career? Yes, of course I'm going to do that. Welcome
[11109.58s -> 11117.61s]  to the next eight hours. I can't wait. I'm so excited. I actually am. I've been waiting
[11117.61s -> 11127.13s]  a long time to get this greencast controller in my hand for this. But unfortunately that's
[11127.13s -> 11131.13s]  going to be the end of this night's stream because I have some stuff I got to do tomorrow.
[11131.85s -> 11140.81s]  But really though, I'm going to go pee and I'm going to get myself prepared. I'll be right back.
