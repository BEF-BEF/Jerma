[1.08s -> 5.72s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jirva here with Scare Saturdays.
[5.72s -> 10.46s]  I know it's been quite a long time since you've seen a Scare Saturdays. It's been at least,
[10.46s -> 14.62s]  god I don't know, maybe three or four weeks since I've done a real Scare Saturdays video.
[14.62s -> 20.38s]  And if you didn't notice, I'm not in my typical place right now. This is a hotel room.
[20.38s -> 25.90s]  And if you saw my last video, I'm currently not in North Carolina. I'm in Virginia right now.
[25.90s -> 30.94s]  It is my sister's 30th birthday party. I was actually, I was gonna get her up here
[30.94s -> 35.82s]  to like get in front of the camera, but she was like, no. So that's not happening.
[35.82s -> 40.94s]  So let's just get right into this here. I'm gonna play Grey, which is a Half-Life 2 Episode 2 mod.
[41.82s -> 47.02s]  And let's get started. I heard really, really good things about this game. Heard it is terrifying.
[47.02s -> 53.90s]  And also, before we really get started, this is not my typical setup. I'm using my laptop's webcam
[53.90s -> 59.50s]  and this $10 microphone that I got at Staples like an hour ago. So if the audio quality and
[59.50s -> 65.66s]  the video quality is not what you're used to, then I do apologize for that. But it's what I'm
[65.66s -> 71.10s]  working with. It's all I got right now. So let's just start a new game. Are you sure you want to
[71.10s -> 81.22s]  start a new game? Uh, yeah. Let's start it. Pickle tea. I can't even pick hard, so normal.
[81.86s -> 93.67s]  All right, let's go. Door open. Hi, door. What the hell is that? What the hell is going on?
[94.23s -> 103.13s]  I hear noises. Oh, what on earth? What is this? Like a head shrinker? What's going on here?
[104.01s -> 112.54s]  Can I open this? I don't think I can open that. Oh, my God. That guy's got a knife. That guy's
[112.54s -> 120.71s]  got a knife, man. Oh, my God. This is, I don't even want to go down this hallway.
[122.58s -> 138.70s]  This guy's just got a knife. He's going to tell you. I guess we go in here. Am I falling down?
[139.18s -> 150.68s]  Do I have a flashlight? No. What the hell? What have you done? I don't know. What have you done?
[150.68s -> 155.16s]  You're running around like a freak. Reminds me of Nightmare House. It's the girl running in front
[155.16s -> 161.35s]  of you, scaring the absolute crap out of you. Can I close the door, please? Blood all over the walls,
[161.35s -> 172.22s]  which is never a good thing. Hey! Am I? Do I have the same hair color? Do I have the same
[172.22s -> 182.42s]  facial features? Wow. This is very, very morbid. This is terrifying, guys. The atmosphere of this
[182.42s -> 190.50s]  game is really just absolutely terrifying. Whoa. This is some art deco going on here.
[194.92s -> 203.14s]  What is that? What is that thing? What on earth is this? If this thing touches me, do I get hurt?
[206.30s -> 214.79s]  Oh my god. I feel like I'm in a haunted house. Get me the hell away from these things. Do I get
[214.79s -> 224.52s]  like a weapon eventually or something? I hope so. And we're going down the checkerboard hallway,
[224.52s -> 231.00s]  where it looks like it's going to be forever. X. Touch that. Oh, I already knew what I had to do.
[231.80s -> 234.76s]  I already knew what I had to do right there. That's how much of a pro I am.
[235.72s -> 244.50s]  What is it? Are there more X's that I have to hit? I guess so. There's plenty of them. Let's push
[244.50s -> 258.15s]  them all, baby. Okay. That's all of them, right? I think so. I think so. Oh, no. No, we missed one.
[258.15s -> 270.74s]  We missed one. I just heard the unlock sound. There we go. God. This is just, this is just awful.
[270.82s -> 278.57s]  Like just disgusting and ridiculous. I'd hate to be that guy. Oh,
[281.75s -> 307.59s]  this is the creepiest game I've ever played. Oh, oh my god. Holy god. That was my whole brain.
[307.59s -> 312.60s]  You know, when like your brain, when things just like snap and you feel like you just got hit by
[312.60s -> 318.90s]  a car, but you're sitting in a desk and you're fine. That's, I just feel like I got hit by a car.
[318.90s -> 333.85s]  Wow. All right. Now where the hell are we? All right. So I'm dating that girl
[335.43s -> 338.47s]  and she doesn't like me anymore. I don't think that's the right character.
[341.30s -> 346.58s]  I feel like something's gonna jump in my face right now. Oh, is this just,
[346.58s -> 353.96s]  oh, okay. So I am this guy. All right. Let's go, man. Toilet. Gotta take a dump. Hold on.
[356.02s -> 359.38s]  Excuse me. I don't want anyone to look at me while I'm taking a dump. Can we please
[359.94s -> 366.20s]  close the stall door, please? Let's go. What the, what the hell?
[369.40s -> 375.94s]  How come I have hands now? I didn't have hands before. Make sure I'm not missing anything here.
[377.34s -> 383.27s]  I'm, I've been known to just miss things. Okay. This is cut scene.
[383.27s -> 395.38s]  Currently in some weird room. My face is pulsing. Whatever. Where is everyone? Did they close up?
[395.38s -> 399.94s]  Voice acting. Pretty cool. Hold tab periodically to see your current objective.
[400.74s -> 406.50s]  Figure out where everyone is. That's pretty vague. What should I do? I wonder where everybody is.
[406.50s -> 417.69s]  Find everybody. That's malarkey. Oh, swear word. Swear word. Cut it off.
[418.90s -> 422.02s]  Maybe I'll find something useful in the tool shop down the alley.
[422.82s -> 428.50s]  Really? You could have told me I could have needed that. Can I like just call somebody on the phone?
[429.46s -> 433.08s]  I'm going to call somebody on the phone. Let me get, let me get some help from burger boy here.
[434.36s -> 441.91s]  Burger boy? Yeah, it's Jerma. How the hell do I get out of here? All right. Where is it?
[441.91s -> 444.95s]  Did I like walk by it? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Is that like a saw? Can I pick up the saw?
[445.67s -> 450.63s]  Can I pick up the saw? No, I can't pick up the saw. Of course I can.
[453.62s -> 458.68s]  They're both. What am I supposed to do here? This is like, this is the tool shed, isn't it?
[460.10s -> 464.82s]  I see a saw right here. I should be able to pick that up and like throw it at somebody.
[465.54s -> 470.98s]  All right. No map. Don't know where the hell I'm going, but you know, we're going to get there
[470.98s -> 480.92s]  eventually. What happened to this door? All right. This looks like it's a repair shop. I see a car.
[482.63s -> 489.35s]  Or did I just come out the same way I went in? Oh, I totally did. All right. Hey, you learn
[489.35s -> 499.70s]  something every day. Where, where has my little. Oh, there we go. What does that say? Tool shop.
[501.75s -> 509.62s]  Yes, I will open that door. Yes, I will. I'm looking for some tools. If you got any tools,
[509.62s -> 517.40s]  I'll take them. I'll take one of the monies in the register too. Ooh, found it. Excellent.
[518.28s -> 527.11s]  Excellent. A bolt cutter. Let's go open that door. Let's go open that freaking door. Hold on. Let
[527.11s -> 534.31s]  me take a drink of my delicious water. Let me take a sip of my delicious water. Let's go.
[539.18s -> 547.21s]  It was this way. I think I remember. I think it was this way. I've been wrong before and I
[547.21s -> 556.73s]  am totally wrong. I wish there was a sprint. I'm kind of just like, I'm going to meet my maker.
[557.86s -> 565.22s]  Let's go meet the maker. We're going to meet the maker. I'm going back the way I came.
[565.22s -> 574.66s]  Meet your maker. Meet your maker. Burger Boy's Baker. Meet your maker. Meet your maker.
[574.66s -> 581.38s]  Meet your maker. Where is Burger Boy's Baker. All right. That's enough of that. I keep on going in
[581.38s -> 585.78s]  like the same. I'm literally going back and forth in the same directions. I need to like pay attention
[585.78s -> 592.55s]  to the game. Too busy making like a song about Burger Boy. Can I go in here? Nope, I can't.
[593.19s -> 596.70s]  That's this is the way. This is the way. No, this is the way over here.
[598.84s -> 611.35s]  Yeah, right. Yeah, right. This is the way, right? I'm so confused. Yes. Excellent. Excellent. Let's
[611.35s -> 619.10s]  go. Cutscene. Tip. Don't forget some useful gray key bindings such as mouse two for iron sights.
[620.79s -> 627.22s]  There's iron sights in this game? H to open memos and tap for eject. Okay. So apparently this is
[627.22s -> 635.56s]  like Call of Duty Half-Life 2 mod episode horror Modern Warfare Black Ops 4. Let's go. Oh, frame
[635.56s -> 640.84s]  rate. Oh my God. I'm getting a bad frame rate here. I'm getting like eight frames a second.
[641.56s -> 655.35s]  Here we go. What you got for me in here? What you got for me in here? Why can I not pick this up?
[657.14s -> 665.05s]  I think this flashlight has batteries. Does it have batteries? Yeah, it does. All right.
[665.05s -> 676.07s]  Let's kick this off here. Let's go. Oh, we love this. It's jammed. There's an arrow pointing that
[676.07s -> 689.70s]  way. So I'm going to go this way. Don't know what that is, but I just picked it up. What about in
[689.70s -> 698.28s]  here? Ooh, back outside. Every single door is locked and now I'm at a dead end. Where am I supposed
[698.28s -> 704.42s]  to put it? What can I turn on the AC? It's getting hot in here. Kind of is getting hot in here in real
[704.42s -> 721.43s]  life. Oh, okay. Through block 12. Sounds easy enough. Okay. Through block 12. I'm going to push
[721.43s -> 740.97s]  all this stuff over. Why am I stuck in here? Oh, through block 12. I have no idea where I'm supposed
[741.21s -> 750.04s]  to go. Block 12. It could be any of these jammed up doors. Is it like a trap door? No. Actually,
[750.04s -> 764.63s]  kind of is. This door I dropped. Well, definitely not in the storage room. I don't know. I just
[764.63s -> 775.22s]  don't know, guys. What the hell is that? This guy's going to turn around. He's going to run at me.
[778.62s -> 788.26s]  He didn't run at me. That makes me happy. He's probably going to be behind me now and I'm going
[788.26s -> 791.62s]  to be scared and I'm going to freak out because he's going to be right behind me. Go, go, go, go,
[791.62s -> 798.95s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I thought these things were bad guys, were like scary ghosts,
[798.95s -> 806.71s]  but they're just pillars in the ground. Oh man. Fine with me. Every door is locked. Don't expect
[806.79s -> 827.27s]  to. That thing had long arms. That was like a slender man. Woman. Oh damn it. God. That's
[827.27s -> 832.86s]  supposed to be my mother. This is horrible. Hey mom, sorry I was late for school that one time.
[832.86s -> 839.43s]  Don't like rip out my eyeballs and feed them to me. Where was I going this way? Where like mommy
[839.43s -> 854.60s]  went? I heard something. I hate these little enclosed person. It is a person. This is where
[854.60s -> 861.45s]  it starts to get really messed up. Oh damn it. I hate when it gets like this. He's going to like
[861.45s -> 874.25s]  stand up and pee on me. Okay. There's a key. Let me go. Come on. Let's go. Give me the key and give
[874.25s -> 881.96s]  me his label for the back exit. I've got to hurry. How'd that guy die? Anyways, can I like, no, I
[881.96s -> 892.06s]  can't go over there. Oh, this way. Oh, I don't want to see this. I don't want to see this thing
[892.06s -> 911.21s]  again. It's like slender woman. Turn my flashlight back on. All right. Sick radio. I don't care about
[911.21s -> 917.05s]  your dumb radio. Let's take a bath. Wash away the hatred I have. Anything in the fridge? Any like
[917.05s -> 924.57s]  burgers? I'm just, I'm delaying right now. I'm stalling because I don't want to see that thing
[924.57s -> 949.10s]  again. Can I go this way? Yeah, there's nothing in here. Nothing in here. The stairs. I don't
[949.10s -> 954.70s]  remember going up the stairs, so I'll go down them. That's fine with me. Any hidden stuff? No.
[955.66s -> 975.88s]  There's the key. Cutscene. Batteries increase your flashlight's field of view while also reducing
[975.88s -> 988.63s]  its chance to flicker temporarily. Good to know. Good to know. All right. Let's end episode one
[988.63s -> 992.47s]  right here. Phil, I've been playing for a little while now. I can try and get this out into one
[992.47s -> 999.11s]  episode. Thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And if you, did you hear
[999.11s -> 1004.39s]  that? If you want to see more Gray, let me know. If you guys want to leave a like on the video or
[1004.39s -> 1008.55s]  a comment or something, just let me know if you want to see more of this because I heard it gets,
[1008.55s -> 1011.99s]  it can get pretty difficult later on. So if you just want to see the intro, which is the
[1011.99s -> 1017.03s]  thing that in the very beginning, which is really screwed up if you ask me, yeah, just let me know
[1017.03s -> 1022.55s]  and I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody.
