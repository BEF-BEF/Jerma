[0.76s -> 6.22s]  It's been a long time coming. We've been waiting for this one.
[6.22s -> 12.71s]  Desperados 3. Launched on Steam. And I'm gonna play it the day that it launches.
[12.71s -> 17.61s]  I've been talking about this shit for like at least a week or two.
[17.61s -> 25.74s]  Man, it's not like I've ever done that before. Talking about Half-Life Alyx for about six months.
[25.74s -> 32.76s]  We've been waiting for this one though, except not really at all.
[32.76s -> 40.98s]  I played Desperados 2 and I made a video on Desperados 2 for those that do not know.
[40.98s -> 45.66s]  It's pretty fun. It's pretty crazy. They made another one.
[45.66s -> 53.69s]  So I'm gonna play it. Zero viewers. No viewers. Omega Low. Yeah, all right.
[53.69s -> 61.10s]  Well, uh, whatever. I'm okay with zero viewers. You know why?
[61.10s -> 66.39s]  Because that's an fucking infinite number. It's a never-ending circle.
[66.39s -> 77.96s]  There is an infinite amount of you here. Zero is infinity.
[77.96s -> 82.23s]  Oh wait, no. Infinity is like eight, right? All right.
[82.23s -> 84.95s]  Let's have eight viewers because that's like the infinity symbol.
[84.95s -> 97.48s]  Let's have eight. Zero is infinity. No, zero is. That means no one.
[97.48s -> 101.54s]  What does the infinite symbol look like? It's like an eight, right?
[101.62s -> 109.24s]  The infinity symbol. What is it? Why is this not the first?
[109.24s -> 111.96s]  Yeah, it's a sideways. Okay. It's like a pair of goggles.
[115.10s -> 117.34s]  It's an eight. That's an eight. That's an eight sideways.
[117.34s -> 120.46s]  It's an eight lined out. That's fine. Hey, thank you Game Watch.
[121.18s -> 128.25s]  The 10 community subs. Appreciate it. Thank you Game Watch.
[129.21s -> 132.71s]  10 fucking subs just came in. A lot of money. Thank you.
[135.08s -> 142.38s]  You're playing Doritos 3. That would be weird if this was Doritos characters.
[145.16s -> 149.21s]  Doritos doesn't even have characters. They never did that. They never tried that.
[150.52s -> 154.84s]  All Doritos characters were just way too enthusiastic adults giving their children
[154.84s -> 163.05s]  junk food or stealing the junk food from their children. That's pretty much all they've done.
[163.05s -> 174.73s]  The Doritos bag is the character. Oh yeah. Didn't it like tilt around?
[174.73s -> 179.45s]  It wasn't like, hey kids, it's been a while. Doritos. They moved around, right?
[180.41s -> 185.67s]  They did that. The Doritos bag like tilted and it didn't have a mouth, but it talked, right?
[185.75s -> 196.23s]  In like one commercial? No, really? No, it definitely did.
[197.51s -> 199.59s]  Somebody said that in chat. I distinctly remember it happening.
[200.23s -> 204.09s]  I never said anything like that. Creep. Why are you calling me a creep?
[204.09s -> 208.01s]  Because I misplaced a Doritos ad. Therefore, I'm a creep.
[216.78s -> 220.30s]  What was that Doritos commercial? Oh yeah. It was like a Doritos bag.
[221.02s -> 226.30s]  Yeah. Doritos are really just tasty. You creep. Get away from me. Don't look at him.
[226.30s -> 236.42s]  Go this way everybody. Dairy. We only eat, we only eat Teddy's natural corn chips.
[238.09s -> 245.78s]  You fucking disgusting creepy. All right. We have a game to play. We're
[245.78s -> 251.53s]  going to play Desperados 3. We only drink peanut butter oil. I'm, I can't, I'm,
[251.53s -> 257.53s]  I'm still angry about that. Ask pre stream chat. I was still angry about that today.
[258.68s -> 264.41s]  I was being told that peanut butter was unhealthy and I gave everybody detention in pre stream chat.
[265.74s -> 270.63s]  Because if you think that peanut butter is an unhealthy snack, then your teachers are
[270.63s -> 277.37s]  fucking aliens and they're giving you an alien learning book. It's not, it is not,
[277.37s -> 283.66s]  it's unbelievable to hear that. You guys need a nutrition lesson. Okay. Real peanut butter,
[283.66s -> 290.33s]  not like the shit with like 30 grams of Coca-Cola sugar soda put in it. I'm talking about real
[290.33s -> 298.34s]  peanut butter. It's no sugar added. It's got so many delicious, healthy fats. It's got fiber.
[298.34s -> 302.86s]  It's got protein. You know, if you got like locked in a basement, like let's say, let's say,
[302.86s -> 307.58s]  let's say there's like an absolute destruction of the earth and you're downstairs in somebody's
[307.58s -> 313.48s]  bunker and it's walls of peanut butter, you can stay alive until while that peanut butter is gone.
[313.48s -> 317.51s]  It's a goddamn complete food. It's got your protein. It's got your fat. It's got your
[317.51s -> 320.47s]  carbohydrates. It's got your fiber. You could live if peanut butter is a superfood, you could
[320.47s -> 329.83s]  live out of it. It's true. Thank you. I want to VIP that person for an hour. For some reason,
[329.83s -> 333.67s]  when I bring up the word peanut butter, people think I'm like eating cotton candy out of the
[333.67s -> 339.29s]  bag before you turn it into cotton candy. Like I'm just eating cotton candy sugar. That's like
[339.29s -> 346.23s]  what I'm telling people apparently. Holy shit, dude. You eat like a whole tub of ice cream.
[346.23s -> 354.02s]  No, I like peanut butter. That's the same thing. I mean, I like cookies and cream. Ben and Jerry's
[354.02s -> 362.22s]  like the rest of us, man, but I don't, you eat the whole, the whole tub. No, I like peanut butter.
[362.22s -> 371.37s]  I love peanut butter. It's like my favorite thing ever. Do a peanut butter stream right now. I'll
[371.37s -> 378.86s]  tell you. You go, if you guys have like a Whole Foods around you, it's so simple. It's basic. It's
[378.86s -> 388.92s]  so easy. The 365, just default Whole Foods brand 365 creamy peanut butter on the shelf. Go get it.
[389.64s -> 395.32s]  You can always tell because it's the one with the, it's the one with the oil on top. Get that one.
[395.32s -> 398.74s]  Get that one and just do, just do it and just eat it a little bit. Just put some, put it on a
[398.74s -> 404.42s]  fucking piece of celery. Dip your pretzels in it. Put it on like a toast and just please trust me
[404.42s -> 414.66s]  on this. You have to trust me. Not as healthy as, yeah, we went by too fast. I don't even know what
[414.66s -> 429.64s]  you said. He's the peanut butter guy. Pure peanut oil is not good for you. I don't know why you guys
[429.64s -> 435.72s]  get this misconception that I'm telling you to like put it in an IV bag and put it in, drain peanut
[435.72s -> 448.26s]  oil into your veins. But it's, peanut butter is a good snack. All right, let's play. I'm going to,
[449.14s -> 452.74s]  at some point during this stream, remind me, we're going to go over my food pyramid.
[453.46s -> 456.66s]  I'm making a food pyramid for you guys because I think a lot of you guys might have a little bit
[456.66s -> 463.96s]  of unhealthy, unhealthy, non-nutritional shit in your life. I'm not doing hard. I'm so glad
[463.96s -> 472.18s]  he can't even pick anything other than normal. He's got a nut addiction. He nuts are great.
[472.90s -> 480.02s]  Sunflower seeds, peanuts, walnuts, almonds. If you're not allergic to them, eat them. I got so many
[480.02s -> 487.66s]  good things in them. All right. I, I, I'm just, I'm not going to do, what is it? Beginner or this
[487.66s -> 499.77s]  one's on fire. I don't like this one. There's a hard and then there's a super hard. It requires
[499.77s -> 503.77s]  perfect planning and execution. Enemies have lightning reflexes. Characters have almost no
[503.77s -> 508.66s]  health and ammo. This is not recommended for a first playthrough, regardless of player skill.
[508.66s -> 515.43s]  Recommended for veterans of the real time tactic genre, not me. We're going to stay on normal.
[515.43s -> 524.26s]  Thank you. I'm not doing super hard. I've learned my lesson. I can't do that anymore.
[524.26s -> 528.20s]  I can't just fucking pick the hardest difficulty for a joke for 10 minutes and then we have to
[528.20s -> 531.32s]  restart the stream. I don't want to, I'm not doing that. I'm not that guy anymore.
[531.32s -> 539.74s]  That's all you guys want. You want me to get destroyed for like 30 minutes and then, you know,
[539.74s -> 543.56s]  I'm going to turn it off and turn it back on again on normal. We're skipping that part.
[543.56s -> 563.85s]  Fod watchers, you don't have to do anything. Stay here. It's really low. This is a lot of audio.
[563.85s -> 579.05s]  So low. He chugged peanut. Guys, I would, I will eat at least five or six full spoonfuls of
[579.05s -> 584.49s]  peanut butter on stream. That's normal to me. That's not abnormal. That's not like, oh, I will
[584.49s -> 593.06s]  do that and it'll be fine. That's like a routine. Johnny, you're straggling. Come on. Right behind
[593.06s -> 601.75s]  you, pa. Eat a whole jar. No, that's now you're good. Now that's unhealthy. Now that's not good
[601.75s -> 612.60s]  for you. I'm going on ahead. You follow and keep your head down. Let's get like a top down red dead
[612.60s -> 617.72s]  redemption too. Yes, sir. Which one am I? Wait, that's me. That's, that's the guy from the second
[617.72s -> 630.90s]  game, right? Sly Cooper. Come on. Somebody said it in pre-stream. Somebody said Sly Cooper in
[630.90s -> 637.34s]  pre-stream chat and it's stuck in my brain. All right. Move. I got this. All right. That's pretty
[637.34s -> 644.98s]  responsive. Move camera mouse. Right. W A S D does not move the camera. Okay. I can hold middle mouse
[644.98s -> 652.10s]  button just like every RTS. Okay. Right on my way. Where am I going? Drink out of the water.
[652.90s -> 666.86s]  Ooh, wait. Is there a, there's a super zoom and I tilt. Ooh. Cool. Sure thing. I'm going to get so
[666.86s -> 680.94s]  fucking killed. All right. Crouch. Son man. Okay. Crouch. It's now or never. Use. Use control.
[681.58s -> 691.59s]  Am I using? Control. I'm ready this time. Use control. On my way. Display view come.
[692.39s -> 702.47s]  Display view come. They found us. Stop. What the hell happened? Sorry. I slipped up.
[705.91s -> 712.65s]  Thank God. Thank God I'm here with my friend. Okay. Why does it say use control? What does it
[712.65s -> 717.29s]  for? What control? I can't use anything. Oh, you have to hold it and then grab. Okay.
[718.25s -> 725.14s]  He came in and threw a knife at the guy's neck. If an enemy sees you in their view cone,
[726.02s -> 729.46s]  if the enemy sees you, the view cone fills with yellow, right? It's like metal gear solid.
[729.46s -> 733.06s]  If the yellow reaches you, the enemy detects you start attacking and sounding alarms. Yeah. Yeah.
[733.06s -> 740.31s]  Yeah. So just like it's metal gear solid too. There it is. Like, which there he is. Right. Okay.
[740.31s -> 745.99s]  There's the first guard. I need to be sneaky about this. Leave it to me. Okay. First guard.
[745.99s -> 756.73s]  Can I loot this guy? Is it time? Sure. Let's go. All right. Let's go. Crouch. On my way.
[756.73s -> 761.50s]  Okay. Quick save. Thank God. There's a quick save. You can save the game at any time.
[761.50s -> 765.26s]  I'm pressing F5. Quick load by pressing F8. F8. Okay. I'm going to be using this all the time.
[765.26s -> 777.53s]  F5 and F8. Hey, thank you. Sly Cuper for the 10 subs. Thanks for the 10 subs. Sly Cuper.
[778.74s -> 785.38s]  Use it often. Failing and retrying is intended and part of the game. F5 and F8. Okay. F5.
[786.42s -> 792.55s]  All right. Good. Last save one. Is that going to keep, is that going to stay there? Sure.
[797.38s -> 802.10s]  Sure. Let's go. Copper can throw a coin to distract enemies with the blue radius.
[802.98s -> 812.33s]  Press E then press L and mouse. Sure. I'll throw one of my coins. Good idea.
[812.41s -> 817.45s]  Get him to turn his head. I'll do the rest. Okay. If eventually this is a brick,
[817.45s -> 819.45s]  then I think a lot of you guys need to pay more attention.
[820.25s -> 823.85s]  Need some change? You hear that? Let's go. I'll get it done.
[825.53s -> 831.77s]  Wait. Hey. Why are you so much better than me? Remember. Think slow. Act fast.
[831.77s -> 835.37s]  Last save thing? You always hide the body. Why do I have to constantly count things up?
[837.42s -> 845.53s]  Right. On my way. To hide the body? All right. Now what? Follow me. Keep your head down.
[846.25s -> 850.15s]  Catch up to your father. Oh, he's my dad. Okay. It's now or never.
[850.87s -> 860.73s]  Shout out. Showdown mode. Shift. I got this. This might be fun. Incoming dead dad.
[867.48s -> 873.64s]  No, they're not going to do that in this game. Showdown mode pauses the game and lets you plan
[873.64s -> 879.24s]  one action per character. Okay. You can execute actions right away or save them for a later time
[879.24s -> 883.74s]  for a shift into showdown mode. So it's a pause. Then you can just go, all right,
[883.74s -> 887.74s]  I want to do this. I'm going to do that. I'll do that. Okay. Let's do showdown mode.
[887.74s -> 892.73s]  Don't come to me. I'm just standing. Showdown. Throw coin at horse.
[893.83s -> 900.92s]  E. One fake coin. Leave it to me. Coin at horse. Continue. Execute order.
[902.84s -> 913.78s]  All right. Do it again. She wants to still have plenty of money on my way. Execute.
[914.58s -> 924.86s]  Okay. Why don't you just throw knives at people, dude? You just like, I don't get it. Sure thing.
[924.86s -> 929.34s]  Wait, is this person unconscious? Hey, pa. Yeah. How many men does Frank have?
[929.34s -> 933.10s]  Doesn't matter, boy. What are you doing? One on one. You always got a chance.
[933.66s -> 941.91s]  You just got to thin out the pack. Okay. Safe. Sure. Let's go. Knife camera.
[943.69s -> 948.87s]  Locked. No surprise there. Distract the guard. Anger the horse.
[949.51s -> 955.51s]  All right, son. Time for a challenge. See that ladder up there? I need you to throw it down for
[955.51s -> 962.81s]  me. Okay. Mouse wheel zoom and get it. Sure. No problem. Oh, thank God. He knows where to go.
[963.77s -> 967.06s]  I would have walked around in circles and everyone would have been like, oh my God,
[967.06s -> 970.50s]  he's pretty, he doesn't know what he's pretending. I don't even have to pretend.
[970.50s -> 977.30s]  I can just play. Oh, you'd have a double tap. Cool. I got this. I knock it down.
[978.95s -> 985.85s]  It's going to be an acting screen. Good job. That's my boy. It was easy.
[986.97s -> 994.22s]  Somebody's getting $50. All right. Him times gave 5,000 bits. Thanks to the $50 and they do
[994.22s -> 999.34s]  the, they say, mwah, the French champagne. Always been celebrated for its excellence.
[1000.30s -> 1003.90s]  Leave it in your head. They start with the interruptions. Stay cool. Hey, thank you for
[1003.90s -> 1011.08s]  the, that's a $50 interruption. Thank you. Well, crouched space. You can safely move through the
[1011.08s -> 1019.00s]  dark striped area of enemy's view cans while scrouched on a roof. I can't even read anymore.
[1019.00s -> 1027.24s]  What's going on? I'm only 34. What's happening? This doesn't, this is stupid. Why? I used to be
[1027.24s -> 1036.82s]  able to read anything. Why did I add an S? You're always hit into guards as long as you stay in the
[1036.82s -> 1046.42s]  darker area. Okay. Yeah, I know. Quick save. He's only 34 and he's like, you can't even read anymore.
[1046.42s -> 1052.84s]  You've got to find a way to sneak through. Oh yeah. He was crushed. Okay. You cone.
[1056.04s -> 1060.44s]  All right. We've got an area here. We've got to go this way. I'll get it done.
[1061.48s -> 1066.76s]  That explains why the old bastard has it in for her. It's now or never. You're a view cone.
[1067.32s -> 1072.52s]  I've got to go down here. Wait, can I just walk across? It's not going to, it has to turn yellow,
[1072.52s -> 1080.79s]  right? I should go this way. I can climb up this. I'm going to go for it. Here we go.
[1080.79s -> 1087.42s]  Her only friend is his bottle. Sure. Let's go. This dude's face is way too small for his skull.
[1087.42s -> 1096.41s]  Right on my way. Oh, stop. Stop. My money'd be on Hutch. How can I get up there? Quick too.
[1097.37s -> 1101.77s]  Leave it to me. Something. Ah, I found you. Fuck.
[1111.86s -> 1121.70s]  Dad, dad. All right. Let's go. So what have to go? How do I go around that then? Sure.
[1123.30s -> 1128.63s]  Roach. You've got to find a way to sneak through. Okay. So did this person turn?
[1128.63s -> 1132.07s]  Wait, I forgot the coin. I have the coin. Here we go. Ready?
[1135.99s -> 1143.77s]  There was something on my way. All right. Can they see that? Can they look above?
[1147.30s -> 1148.58s]  Save, save, save, save, save. They can't look.
[1154.95s -> 1162.41s]  And nowhere. Where are they going? Are they going up the stairs?
[1165.61s -> 1173.02s]  I don't know. We're good. Oh, you want to go up there? Okay. Let's go up there together.
[1177.70s -> 1182.18s]  See the one in the back near the cliff? Find a way to distract him with your coming.
[1182.18s -> 1189.16s]  Then I can take them both out. Okay. One fake coin coming up.
[1190.92s -> 1199.14s]  The other one, John. We'll get him. He's not looking. How far can I throw? Still got plenty left.
[1200.18s -> 1212.52s]  How far can I throw this? Leave it to me. Oh, shit. I knock him out. Hey. On my way. One fake coin
[1212.52s -> 1218.28s]  coming up. What's that noise? Sure. The other one, John. I'm working on it. Hold on. I don't think
[1218.28s -> 1227.24s]  he's going to be able to get down here. Oh, sure thing. Still got plenty left. Need some change.
[1230.68s -> 1243.29s]  All right. Go get him, dad. He's still breathing. Tie him up and quick before he comes to.
[1244.41s -> 1251.21s]  What? What do you mean tie him up? How do I tie him up? Oh, shit. There's a tutorial. He left a note
[1251.21s -> 1256.50s]  for me to tell me how. You can hide bodies in bushes. Houses and other places. Hold control
[1256.50s -> 1261.22s]  then press left mouse to pick up a body. Hold control and press left mouse to drop a body.
[1262.34s -> 1275.29s]  Okay. Don't mind me. Good job. Now hide him in the bushes. Am I too weak to pick him up?
[1276.09s -> 1293.27s]  Look at this. Atta boy. Let's go. Sure. No problem. Right. On my way. Where is he? Where'd he go?
[1297.06s -> 1300.50s]  He did a full swan dive. It's now or never. We got to get moving.
[1301.38s -> 1310.46s]  Rotate camera. Hold on. Yes. I will. On my way. That was fucking crazy. Holy shit. I don't know
[1310.46s -> 1315.82s]  that was going to happen. How am I still? Okay. I did good. Browse. Where'd they all come from?
[1316.46s -> 1321.98s]  You got her. See that crane up there? Yeah. How about you go over there and make a delivery?
[1322.86s -> 1326.54s]  Coming right up, sir. I have to stand up and be like I have to wait. How do I do that?
[1327.10s -> 1338.31s]  They're looking in every direction. Sure. Let's go. The hell? How do I get up there?
[1339.72s -> 1347.40s]  Glad I picked up these. Forget it. That's nothing. Sure thing. Son of a bitch.
[1348.04s -> 1354.76s]  Transmit. I got you. Spread out. Let's take him down. Why would he run up there?
[1357.46s -> 1361.94s]  Dad died. Dad died. How about you go over there and make a delivery?
[1362.82s -> 1371.10s]  Coming right up, sir. Forget it. That's nothing. Oh shit. There's bushes on my way. Excuse me,
[1371.10s -> 1383.96s]  dad. Leave it to me. Glad I picked up these. Son of a bitch. Stop. Let's take him down, boys.
[1384.92s -> 1393.10s]  All right, guys. Let's smoke him out. If I make a mistake and try to run away,
[1393.10s -> 1401.67s]  dad just goes, oh no, son. I'm going to run into all of them and die. No. That crane up there?
[1401.67s -> 1405.91s]  Yeah. How about you go over there and make a delivery? No, my son. Coming right up, sir.
[1405.91s -> 1409.83s]  Dad died. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We get it. Glad I picked up these. Yeah,
[1409.83s -> 1416.63s]  the dad died. Sure thing. Okay. I'm hidden in the bush. I'm going to climb up that.
[1420.04s -> 1430.63s]  One fake coin. Coming up. This way. Come on. Turn around. I got this. Good. Nice. All right.
[1430.63s -> 1437.29s]  Nobody up here? Leave it to me. Is it time? Okay. You can highlight all interactable objects
[1437.29s -> 1442.58s]  if you press H. Wow. That's really useful. Okay. Cool. I have to go over there and drop
[1442.58s -> 1452.20s]  that on those guys. This is a bird's nest. It's now or never. It's in there. Oh, okay.
[1454.49s -> 1463.27s]  So if I drop down here. Hitman looks a lot different than I remember. It does. Sure.
[1463.27s -> 1472.66s]  Let's go. What's that? Oh, that's going in here. I don't want to do that.
[1477.43s -> 1486.23s]  Holy shit. That was kind of brutal. Nice job, son. Now stay right there. I'll come to you.
[1486.31s -> 1493.66s]  Come on up here, dad. Non-descript civilian, 10 subs. There's a lot of fucking subs today.
[1494.46s -> 1502.20s]  It's like 40. Jesus. Good job, boy. You know the drill. You wait till I'm back. Here he comes.
[1502.20s -> 1507.37s]  Here comes the dad. I don't hear it.
[1507.37s -> 1512.39s]  So the same thing last time. Why can't I come with you? Just give me a gun.
[1514.06s -> 1519.26s]  A gun, huh? By the way, I want to tell you something. I got something real important to
[1519.26s -> 1523.66s]  tell you when I get back. I want to see the main part of the story. 15 paces.
[1524.38s -> 1541.05s]  Hit this? What? Oh, you get guns in this game? NA aim. Sorry, sorry, son. I've spent too much
[1541.05s -> 1555.50s]  time online. When you pull that off, you're ready for a gun. See you later, Johnny.
[1556.06s -> 1567.22s]  Do I have to sit here and practice until I get it? I'm aiming at it. We're going to get a
[1567.22s -> 1570.90s]  transition into him having a beard and being like presumably 20 years older.
[1571.62s -> 1576.44s]  Because anytime you get a beard, it means you aged at least 25 years.
[1577.00s -> 1597.85s]  He's gonna get it right when they pull all the way back. Oh, if only the characters could do a
[1597.85s -> 1621.85s]  backflip. All right. Okay. Loading. Look at these loading times. Oh, yeah. A broadcaster.
[1630.26s -> 1634.54s]  Nice. This grenades. This is probably grenades.
[1637.22s -> 1641.82s]  Big Ann. It's like a shootout. Do I get to actually use a gun?
[1642.62s -> 1654.34s]  Come on. Let's show them who's boss. Yeah. Take cover. Brain robbery. Come this way. Let's flank
[1654.34s -> 1676.95s]  him. Holy shit. Who's doing that? That's insane aim. Don't let him get away. Is this me? No.
[1679.03s -> 1690.66s]  These people even have weapons? Well, this is not good. Another notch for Big Ann.
[1691.22s -> 1700.50s]  Hey, Lisa for me. This is a huge train. This is the biggest train I've ever seen in my life.
[1707.10s -> 1721.45s]  Rocky Mountains, Colorado. You're a city slicker. Am I? It's both huge. I wonder what's in here.
[1721.45s -> 1724.89s]  The train was so long that I feel like if the train crashed, it would take like
[1724.89s -> 1739.59s]  four hours before we even figured it out back here. Something tells me you ain't here punching
[1739.59s -> 1747.02s]  tickets. There he is. Is he a beard? Kinda. Seems like we made an unplanned stop. Kinda.
[1747.02s -> 1757.59s]  I'd better go find out what's holding this up. OK. I have a weapon. This game's kind of fun.
[1757.59s -> 1762.15s]  I have to sneak my way up to the front of the train. I have a knife? Holy shit. I can stab people.
[1762.15s -> 1767.03s]  All right. Hold on. This game's fun. OK. Anything else over here? Wait, what about you?
[1768.07s -> 1784.15s]  And up on my way. Hurry up. I'm so glad you could do that.
[1785.45s -> 1790.89s]  OK, here we go. Knife knockout. You can take down enemies up close using your knife.
[1790.89s -> 1795.53s]  We'll knock them out. Press Q to select the knife, then L to attack. For a knockout,
[1796.25s -> 1802.07s]  swap out the skill in the skill bar. I mean, a knockout. Let's make it quick. You fucking serious?
[1806.65s -> 1818.34s]  No, I'm not knocking him out. He's got a gun. Can I pick up that gun? OK. Nice knockout.
[1818.98s -> 1827.59s]  Why would I knock him out? I'm fucking desperado. Throwing knife. Koopa can throw his knife to take
[1827.59s -> 1833.54s]  down enemies from afar. He needs to retrieve it afterwards. This is awesome. Press W to select
[1833.54s -> 1848.22s]  throwing knife and throw it with L. I have to get the knife. Oh shit. Let's knock this guy out.
[1858.25s -> 1870.23s]  Oh shit. That guy had a shovel. That guy had a shovel. All right. That guy was always going to
[1870.23s -> 1877.86s]  give me the shovel. Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. This guy's going to wake up. Throw
[1877.86s -> 1897.99s]  him. OK, he's dead. Give me the knife. You're ignoring that. Put a face cam on the portrait.
[1899.35s -> 1903.59s]  No, I'm naked. I can't do that. David.
[1905.98s -> 1915.46s]  Shall we? No, I'm not going to put casino ink on the portrait. No, no. Hold on. Hold on.
[1915.46s -> 1924.07s]  You said you bought a cowboy costume. Do you really think I did that?
[1928.66s -> 1934.90s]  Jesus, you scared me. Don't hurt him. Let's get going. Here, have a coin. I just need a few
[1934.90s -> 1943.98s]  seconds. Fuck. You say what the fuck? Because I gave him a coin. Koopa can use his revolvers to
[1943.98s -> 1951.14s]  take down guards. Guns are loud and will alarm guards not hear them? Oh shit. OK, what? I have
[1951.14s -> 1963.91s]  two different kinds of guns. Here he comes. I'm doing tricks. Shoot him. I did a trick and he
[1963.91s -> 1975.88s]  didn't shoot him. First the trick button. There's got to be another way. No, I don't have a cowboy
[1975.88s -> 1983.58s]  costume. I made that up. Jesus, you scared me. Can you help us? Where's he looking? Over there.
[1984.38s -> 1992.78s]  He doesn't see you over here. Let's take out the new model army. Remington model. Or the old 51.
[1997.00s -> 2006.04s]  Did you get him? Oh shit. He sees me. Give me more time. How many bullets can this thing hold?
[2006.84s -> 2013.98s]  What's that? Don't look for you. I just used the other gun. Thank you, stranger. Give me money to
[2013.98s -> 2024.66s]  hide. I don't want to shoot them. How do I put this away? Come on. OK, that's good. Who cares
[2024.66s -> 2038.02s]  about lifting them up? Where'd they go? Where'd they go? Did they jump off? It's now or never.
[2038.02s -> 2046.73s]  Next time I better thin down the pack before I get loud. I fell. And no, I'm going to play this like
[2046.73s -> 2052.68s]  I play every game that's like Hitman. Try to sneak in, get stopped at the front door,
[2054.04s -> 2061.72s]  and then just shoot them all. Anything we might regret was this. Well, now maybe throw a grenade
[2061.72s -> 2071.75s]  or two. So should I sneak over here? I feel like this is a character I want to keep. Not a problem.
[2071.75s -> 2079.46s]  Dual shot. You can fire both guns at the same time. You can now choose two targets for Cooper's
[2079.46s -> 2084.10s]  guns. Oh, that's really odd. That's actually really cool. I'll take them both down at the same
[2084.10s -> 2096.81s]  time. One, two, execute. Nice. A two headed boy, thanks to the five subs. I'd say you owe me one.
[2100.62s -> 2115.86s]  Hey, now, are you kidding me? All right. I'd say we're even now. Identify this. Now I suggest you
[2115.94s -> 2122.12s]  return to your wagon. I'll handle things from here like you handled those two.
[2123.96s -> 2131.16s]  Listen, Mr. Cooper, you would recognize your own dad. Mr. Cooper, I've been hired to make
[2131.16s -> 2139.54s]  sure this train gets to Flagstone. I'd appreciate it if you don't get in my way. Well, now, Mr.
[2139.62s -> 2144.58s]  We go like four hours into the game. And he finally talks about how he's like Mr. Cooper.
[2146.58s -> 2151.14s]  Oh, shit. Yeah, dad, it is you. Fuck. In a while. How did I not know?
[2156.92s -> 2176.55s]  You don't typically wear purple. That's a very simple joke.
[2176.55s -> 2180.47s]  The train stopped. He's going to take some work to clear those rocks.
[2181.19s -> 2186.22s]  Me a dynamite. You're going to give me dynamite? Yes, you are. Good thing they have a stash of
[2186.22s -> 2193.50s]  dynamite up on that plateau. Yeah, grab it and clear the tunnel. Not such a bad plan.
[2194.22s -> 2201.02s]  I don't do bad plans. Fair enough. Let's get to it then. All right. Sure thing.
[2201.74s -> 2209.70s]  I don't understand why people just put this huge stuff like stuffed peppers worth of dynamite.
[2212.79s -> 2215.91s]  Why would you do that? Why can't you have like five different barrels? Why does it have to be
[2215.91s -> 2229.14s]  stuffed that much shit in it? I don't know. You can throw your bag. Yeah. OK. He has to retrieve
[2229.14s -> 2237.32s]  it again. A gas trap blinds enemies who opened the bag. Oh, shit. I have more than one character
[2237.32s -> 2241.88s]  now. What is this one syringe? Well, the game just got way better.
[2242.04s -> 2248.14s]  Only temporary. Throw the bag. First enemy to spot it will come for it. If opened, it briefly
[2248.14s -> 2253.82s]  blinds the target with gas. All right, so we're going to go up here. Wait, we can go two different
[2253.82s -> 2263.62s]  ways. All right, you go this way. Let's keep moving. You walk across this. Don't get in the way. I'm
[2263.62s -> 2269.46s]  going to use my bag. You get over there. You just hide and learn something. OK, you go this way.
[2269.46s -> 2275.75s]  Here it goes. Jump over to the other cart. We're going to do this at the same time. It's going to
[2275.75s -> 2284.94s]  be awesome. Oh, I can't. This is a tutorial. Never mind. Someone call for a doctor. Here we go.
[2284.94s -> 2291.40s]  Gas bag E. Let me take care of that. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2291.40s -> 2303.22s]  I need a coin. I can't throw it. Saved me dozens of time. Who wants to have a look? Hey, OK, then.
[2308.07s -> 2317.86s]  Bag came out of the bush. It looks like a gas trap. Huh? Not bad. Wait, is he blind?
[2317.86s -> 2324.94s]  You don't, Mr. Cooper, unless you're me. But can he kill him? Gotta love bandits.
[2326.70s -> 2334.34s]  Leave their boss to me. I smell trouble. This is our train now. I can handle that. Thank you.
[2335.58s -> 2340.14s]  You wasted. Oh, I got it right here. Hold on. Let's throw. OK, we're going to do this.
[2342.30s -> 2349.34s]  You get it. Then you stab him. No, I'm looking at this. That wasn't there before.
[2349.98s -> 2356.30s]  Is this guy going to do it again? This guy's got like the mind of a mouse. OK, let's go. Ready?
[2360.60s -> 2362.84s]  Got him. Fucking teamwork. Perfect.
[2369.98s -> 2374.84s]  Let's move. Get that bag back. You get it? I just have to walk over it. OK.
[2377.91s -> 2381.11s]  They work together. Do they walk together or do I have to control them both independently?
[2382.76s -> 2387.53s]  Bunt line. McCoy can use his bunt line to take down enemies from a long distance if he needs
[2387.53s -> 2396.31s]  this skill for him. Holy shit. OK, if he needs this skill for a mission, he will carry a final
[2396.31s -> 2405.29s]  golden bullet. There's a lookout up on the cliff. I'll take him from here. That I want to see. Well,
[2405.29s -> 2412.49s]  I'll be damned. Give him a chance. Bunt line special. Custom stock. Go that far with a weapon
[2412.49s -> 2422.82s]  like that. Hurry up. Isn't that a pistol? I'll take him up. Where can I put him? On my way.
[2422.82s -> 2426.82s]  Whatever. Who cares? Put him over here. This is the tutorial mission. Who cares?
[2426.82s -> 2439.00s]  Let's go. I've got a group of three up here. It's now or never. Can't climb that shit.
[2439.80s -> 2450.71s]  Can he do anything about this? For the job straight through hell. Right. I'll follow.
[2455.53s -> 2460.65s]  Can he shoot that path is blocked? Understood. Oh, I thought that. Hey, I had a John H was
[2460.65s -> 2465.53s]  activated. It was fucking me up. Well, we'll figure something out. He can't climb. Let's keep our
[2465.53s -> 2472.97s]  distance. Oh, wait, he was too old to climb it. See, save that game. You can highlight both
[2472.97s -> 2479.45s]  characters. No, I beg your pardon. Oh, that's so much better. OK, cool. All right. Nice path is
[2479.45s -> 2491.48s]  blocked this way. The path is blocked. I refuse. No, you can manage this rope ladder, Mr.
[2491.48s -> 2502.36s]  McCoy. I prefer Dr. McCoy. I'm sure you do. Why do we do that? OK, then. I refuse.
[2505.02s -> 2512.54s]  How are we going to tackle this, man? We got a campfire over here. You've guns, right? I know
[2512.54s -> 2516.94s]  I'm supposed to be tactical about this, but is that really going to be a thing? I could do
[2516.94s -> 2521.42s]  the showstopper and we could both do something. I could throw a knife at this guy right now. I'm
[2521.42s -> 2525.02s]  going to throw a knife at this guy right now. OK, he's dead. All right, now go get him. Go get him.
[2525.02s -> 2529.48s]  Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him quick.
[2529.48s -> 2538.20s]  His friend's going to be looking for him. Here goes. Yeah, that worked. All right, let's do it
[2538.20s -> 2549.83s]  again. Someone's about to lose a few teeth. Got it. Let's go. That worked. OK, now what?
[2554.62s -> 2558.78s]  Here goes. What are they? Where's the site? All right, stay behind the rock.
[2560.76s -> 2566.18s]  OK, so I can coin. I'm going to coin him and then the doctor's going to get the doctor's going to.
[2566.18s -> 2570.02s]  Do I get more? OK, I have a question. Do I get more points for doing things
[2570.98s -> 2583.14s]  a good way? Or can I just shoot all the matter? It's just fishing. Wait, give me that back. He's
[2583.14s -> 2592.04s]  not going to see it. All right, give me that back. He's not going to see it. Just what I had in mind.
[2592.04s -> 2595.46s]  Do you see this? All right, he'll see it if I throw it over here.
[2595.46s -> 2600.02s]  All right, so I'm going to gas him and then syringe him. It saved me. Let's throw out the door.
[2600.02s -> 2612.70s]  It works very fast. Here they come. Objection's here.
[2615.48s -> 2620.89s]  I love how you can syringe people in this game. OK, he's gone, too. We only have one more person
[2620.89s -> 2625.45s]  to deal with, and I know exactly how I'm going to do it. Still warming up shoes.
[2625.45s -> 2630.49s]  OK, good. What's the next tutorial?
[2634.50s -> 2638.10s]  Guards wearing ponchos don't get fooled easily. They don't leave their posts
[2639.34s -> 2646.07s]  and distractions are shorter. Oh, that doesn't matter.
[2646.07s -> 2653.83s]  He ain't going to move if it ain't necessary. And you know that because trust me, I know the time.
[2653.91s -> 2660.23s]  Who cares? Just kill him. Just kill him and then punch this guy in the face and throw him over the overboard.
[2667.58s -> 2671.58s]  Oh, no, that guy is wearing a poncho. Does that mean he can't die?
[2672.86s -> 2677.26s]  No, he actually can die very easily like every other human. OK, kill him.
[2677.26s -> 2687.29s]  Oh, that was not good. Is he still unconscious? Showdown mode advanced. OK,
[2687.29s -> 2690.49s]  showdown mode. Pause the game unless you plan one action per character.
[2690.49s -> 2695.56s]  That's important. Press enter to instantly execute all the actions for a shift.
[2695.56s -> 2701.62s]  You want to execute planned actions later. Oh, nice. OK, we can do it together.
[2703.48s -> 2709.72s]  We can do one and two. Give me that knife. OK, let's go back in business.
[2711.24s -> 2719.88s]  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is a guardhouse. Hey, ambush right on schedule.
[2720.92s -> 2725.85s]  Well, I forget what this guy's name is. It'll cost you our hide here.
[2726.65s -> 2729.06s]  I'm going to get extra points. We're going to kill all these people in here. All right.
[2729.06s -> 2734.23s]  Hide here. You hide here. Damn, that train's long. Right. I'm going to gas them.
[2734.23s -> 2738.79s]  Here we go. Anyway, I got a few tricks who wants to have a look.
[2738.79s -> 2750.71s]  One out straight through hell. Never mind. I can handle that. Thank you.
[2750.71s -> 2759.02s]  Let's go. So we're going to I'm going to do advanced mode. Let's see how this works.
[2759.82s -> 2764.65s]  That's sweet. Sweet. Come on. Let's go about this quiet.
[2764.73s -> 2772.14s]  All right. Showdown. You take the other. All right. Showdown. I have a timer on this.
[2773.08s -> 2775.80s]  I don't. OK, good. Let's catch a few bandits.
[2775.80s -> 2780.68s]  I'm going to stab this person in the back and then you're going to syringe this person
[2780.68s -> 2789.53s]  who needs a shot in the next trouble. Oh, come on. Nice. See you in hell.
[2791.42s -> 2798.25s]  OK, that was fun. That was really fun. OK, cool. Now what? Oh, shit. On show.
[2798.97s -> 2803.56s]  Let me take care of that on my way. I would rather stay out of this.
[2804.36s -> 2809.19s]  Selecting multiple characters. You guys already told me that you're sure could use our health.
[2809.99s -> 2815.27s]  I waste time. Let's keep going. Side quest. I hate fancy folk like you.
[2815.27s -> 2817.59s]  All right. We have a side quest. Especially you.
[2817.59s -> 2822.79s]  All right. We're going to throw a guy in the fire because I have to.
[2822.79s -> 2825.51s]  All right. Showdown mode. Right. How do I do this without losing?
[2826.23s -> 2830.87s]  We have moral choices to make. OK, there's a guy right here.
[2831.19s -> 2835.78s]  Three, one, two, three. OK, I'm going to throw. Here we go. This is what we're going to do.
[2836.58s -> 2844.46s]  We're going to throw a knife at this guy, syringe this guy. Here we go. Syringe you.
[2845.91s -> 2849.75s]  OK, then I'm going to switch over here and throw a knife at you. Watch and hurry up.
[2850.73s -> 2851.37s]  And we're going to go.
[2858.31s -> 2862.33s]  All right. He got it. He's good. He's good. He's good. All right. Now shoot him.
[2865.64s -> 2869.94s]  All right. You're all safe. Wait, there's one more. There's one more. There's one more.
[2874.34s -> 2881.24s]  I didn't see that last guy. All right. That didn't work. I waste time. Let's keep going.
[2884.78s -> 2889.42s]  Stop collisioning each other. All right. There's one, two. This is the guy I thought. OK,
[2889.42s -> 2895.06s]  they're all like kneeling down. I thought he was one of them. All right. Eyes open.
[2895.06s -> 2898.50s]  Cooper. Here it goes. I didn't hear. Well, that's what you get.
[2898.90s -> 2904.38s]  Whatever your name is over here. Get a spot right here. Go.
[2905.66s -> 2917.13s]  Shoot two people in showdown. That's right. Oh, yeah. OK. Bag. I think I can just kill this guy.
[2917.13s -> 2921.99s]  I don't need anybody knowing. No, maybe. Yeah, maybe I can. If I just get OK,
[2921.99s -> 2927.13s]  if I just get over there, save it right here. If I just get over here because he can't see.
[2930.89s -> 2941.34s]  All right. He's in a good spot. OK, new plan. What's up?
[2942.39s -> 2945.59s]  You better give us everything. We're going to search your body.
[2946.71s -> 2956.52s]  You hear that? Who needs a good killing? Oh, look. Oh, look. Wait, shit. OK, where are you?
[2956.52s -> 2964.66s]  Ready? I got lots of you going to be big. All right. Stay distracted. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry
[2964.66s -> 2967.46s]  up. Hurry up. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get
[2967.46s -> 2977.34s]  down. Get down. Get down. Get down. I'm fine. All right. OK. Now. I hate fancy folk like you.
[2977.34s -> 2984.94s]  Now I'm going to stab. We're going to bag this guy or bag this guy or OK, we don't walk anyway.
[2989.34s -> 2994.06s]  Let's throw out the lower. That's what you get. Oh, no, no, no. I don't want you to look at it.
[2994.06s -> 3003.58s]  No, no, no, no, no. You don't. I don't want him to look at it. OK, let's go. Let's raise some hell.
[3005.88s -> 3010.25s]  Got a load. It's only let me take care of that. Execute.
[3010.25s -> 3016.84s]  Straight through hell. Did he miss? What just happened? How come he didn't shoot this guy?
[3017.56s -> 3025.61s]  Why didn't he not shoot this guy? Keep it cool. Watch and learn. I'll get close and personal.
[3028.41s -> 3034.89s]  That was a civilian. Thank you. I'll send you the check. Where are they? What's the big idea?
[3035.77s -> 3046.84s]  I didn't kill a civilian, though. Are you kidding me? Wait. I'll follow. No more surprises.
[3047.80s -> 3051.18s]  I know I did not. I didn't kill anybody. It'll cost you.
[3051.90s -> 3061.56s]  It burned bodies. Throw him in the fire. I know, but I don't want to get spotted. Look, you got this
[3061.56s -> 3071.64s]  time. What's he doing? Burn them. But I'm going. I'm going. I just I don't know if this guy's going
[3071.64s -> 3084.65s]  to swap me. How's it going? Hurry up. I just want to. Where's the bad guys? You're heavy on my way.
[3087.66s -> 3097.08s]  And up. I can't. You are the bad guy. I'm not the bad guy. The guy's the guy with the poncho.
[3097.08s -> 3110.04s]  No, forget it. I got a bullet for him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Why can't I shoot him?
[3112.63s -> 3121.35s]  We need to be moving on. This is an obstruction. All right. Oh, God damn it. Um, I think we may
[3121.35s -> 3127.16s]  have a problem. I did. Darren, you're going to have to do the rest of the game because I can't move.
[3127.16s -> 3136.79s]  Now's the time. OK, Darren here. Take a few coins to buy some potions. OK, I have to do
[3136.79s -> 3153.34s]  the rest of the game with him. Just yet. Sure. OK, cool. Let's go. Just load. I think I could
[3153.34s -> 3160.28s]  probably do it. Well, that was a waste of time. See, I knew you had a heart in there somewhere
[3160.28s -> 3173.78s]  anatomically. Maybe someone call for a doctor. How far away is the load? Oh, OK, we're good. We're
[3173.78s -> 3185.93s]  fine. OK, then don't get anywhere. I knew you had a heart in there somewhere. All right, slow down,
[3185.93s -> 3192.09s]  slow down, slow down. Maybe. Wait, there's a there's a treasure chest over there. Understood. I can't
[3192.09s -> 3197.53s]  wait till I get grenades. Seriously. One of the train looks like we made it. We still need the
[3197.53s -> 3207.10s]  dynamite to clear the tunnel. That's easy. Come on, let's make our way up on my way. Shall I get
[3207.10s -> 3214.52s]  out of here? Go run. Keep your heads down and stay out of my way. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Thank you so
[3214.52s -> 3231.32s]  much. You think you're. I see you asshole. I didn't. Let's keep our distance. It's fun.
[3231.32s -> 3235.56s]  I actually like this. This is actually fun. This is like a strategy game, but for fucking moron
[3235.56s -> 3243.21s]  psychos like me. OK, do you like like strategy games with top down like kind of real time?
[3243.21s -> 3250.34s]  Yes. Are you also fucking psycho? Yeah. Oh, you're going to love this. Cool. Thanks. I've always
[3250.34s -> 3255.59s]  wanted to be the psycho RTS guy. Just what I had in mind. Let me take care of that. Where are you
[3255.59s -> 3258.31s]  going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are
[3258.31s -> 3260.95s]  you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where
[3260.95s -> 3267.19s]  are you going? Come on, let's make our way up. Understood. Get down. Don't get in the way. I'm
[3267.19s -> 3275.05s]  trying to read this. The view cone marker shows that the spot is watched by guards. Hold what?
[3275.05s -> 3290.44s]  Hold the L to place in a location or a guard. Not a problem. Something. Well, who do we have here?
[3296.86s -> 3304.70s]  I'm trying to figure out the tutorial. You know, I got to stop clicking everywhere.
[3304.70s -> 3307.50s]  I'm playing this like I'm playing League or like Dota.
[3308.38s -> 3325.90s]  But don't click that often. Why am I like, well, like, slow the fuck down. Shall we?
[3325.90s -> 3332.38s]  You click more often than you click in Diablo. All right. I have to get this treasure. I'm not
[3332.38s -> 3340.46s]  going to. OK, so what was it was hold L. I can see where they're looking or how does that work?
[3340.46s -> 3348.73s]  Let's see. It's kind of like a location of what they're looking at or something.
[3348.73s -> 3354.94s]  Let's see if an area is being watched or not. Looks like we made it.
[3354.94s -> 3361.10s]  I still need the dynamite to clear the tunnel. That's easy. Come on, let's make our way up.
[3364.73s -> 3372.55s]  OK, so leave it on this guy. Not a problem. OK, can I kill this guy and get this stuff
[3372.55s -> 3378.81s]  without anybody seeing me do it in this bush? No, motherfucker. I swear to God. It's OK. Stay right
[3378.81s -> 3405.19s]  there. Let's make it quick. Get him. We'll take care of the bandits. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[3405.75s -> 3408.47s]  All right. Hold on. Is he going to notice that this guy's gone?
[3408.55s -> 3436.17s]  I guess time's a changing. I can't put him down here. Can I? All right. Hold on. Here comes another
[3436.17s -> 3447.66s]  guy with a shovel. Now I want you. I want your eyes. Where are your eyes? There we go. All right.
[3447.66s -> 3454.50s]  There's three of what in here? Someone call for a doctor. I can reload this. Let me take care of
[3454.50s -> 3466.44s]  that. There we go. All right. It's a reload. Nice. Nice. I get the dynamite.
[3466.44s -> 3479.66s]  The safe. I swear. Good time. They think they can hide. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[3479.98s -> 3482.94s]  Somewhere. Drag you out of there.
[3492.06s -> 3496.94s]  Oh, man. There's a sniper. Quick. Hey, stick your neck out as far as it can go, Terry.
[3496.94s -> 3505.42s]  There's a sharpshooter. No more surprises. Got to find them.
[3507.34s -> 3513.82s]  Whoever finds them gets their stuff. What? That sucks. I know they're here. Whoever finds them
[3513.82s -> 3520.46s]  gets their stuff. Okay. Not like not a thousand gold or something. Just get this stuff.
[3520.46s -> 3526.18s]  We got to smoke them out. Someone hiding in there. Shit. Don't let them get away.
[3530.78s -> 3542.15s]  Okay. Let's go reload that again. It'll cost you. I'll take that. Thank you. I hope I don't need
[3542.15s -> 3556.68s]  this. Okay. So we're going to distract. Okay. They're going to go in here, not out here. Yes.
[3556.68s -> 3564.98s]  They're all going back into the train. We're fine. Oh, what about this guy? I beg your pardon.
[3564.98s -> 3572.89s]  Can't get him. It's an obstruction. I'm sorry. Sorry, you two. I can't do anything about it.
[3573.61s -> 3581.32s]  If they make choices. I got a feeling about this. I'm going to throw a coin right here and we're
[3581.32s -> 3586.33s]  going to go do a showdown. These two. Let's see what's happening here. Not yet though.
[3594.33s -> 3602.78s]  Oh, God damn it. Really? Hey, coin. What oldest trick in the book. If we can grab
[3603.34s -> 3608.87s]  all three of these guys, heads or tails, distract three bandits at the same time.
[3611.16s -> 3620.97s]  Uh, I got lots of these need some change. I don't, they're not going to look over here. Go.
[3624.10s -> 3627.94s]  That big rock there is looking like it wants to fall. Wait, I can fit a big
[3629.14s -> 3631.86s]  wave. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3631.86s -> 3639.02s]  hold on a big rock. It was like 10 people right here. Oh no. Okay. Let's just, let's get them.
[3640.39s -> 3643.27s]  All right. Who's going to do it? Somebody has to push it. Push the rock, push the rock, push the
[3643.27s -> 3658.97s]  rock. Excuse me. Go to push the rock. Oh shit. I thought it was going to roll at least a little
[3658.97s -> 3673.29s]  bit. Can I get on a horse? This is wild. Okay. There's one guy here. All right. We're going to
[3673.29s -> 3680.25s]  distract this guy and then you're going to knock yourself out. Oh, together, together, together,
[3680.25s -> 3688.47s]  together at once. Sure thing. Got it. On the horse. We get on the horse. Now's the time. Get on
[3688.47s -> 3695.90s]  the horse. Well, now let's see. I wouldn't worry just yet. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Showdown
[3695.90s -> 3699.02s]  mode. We have to, I, we have to, we have to just kill this guy. Double team him or something.
[3699.02s -> 3704.62s]  Here, go to the gas. I understood. It's just fishing. Hey, that's going to pay for it. Here
[3704.62s -> 3718.97s]  they come. It works very fast. See you in hell. I'm here. What do I do with these?
[3719.21s -> 3725.82s]  What do I do with these? I don't think I can do anything with those guys. Oh shit. Save it.
[3726.46s -> 3736.33s]  You can't see shit. Okay. All right. We almost did the dynamite. I'm almost got it. Somebody's
[3736.33s -> 3739.85s]  about to lose a lot of money betting that I wasn't going to get past the first mission of the game.
[3743.80s -> 3755.56s]  Um, what are you doing? What are you doing? You're about to. Let's go fuse. Trying to touch the
[3755.56s -> 3763.83s]  tutorial. Pick up dynamite from the barrel and throw it. Oh, come on. Yes. Okay. The game just
[3763.83s -> 3770.66s]  increased in value. Aim with Q and throw with it using left mouse. Be careful. It'll explode in
[3770.66s -> 3783.51s]  your hand. Oh no. All right. Oh, only one of us is going to do this. Pick up the dynamite,
[3783.51s -> 3798.06s]  not the guy on the ground. That's a very, very short fuse. It's not, that's a really short fuse.
[3798.78s -> 3806.18s]  By the, I had so many people are just dead up here. All right. Who needs this? I object
[3809.30s -> 3816.57s]  back in business. You better have a fuse. Better throw it fast.
[3817.45s -> 3835.61s]  Wait, it's already lit. Oh shit. The horse. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[3835.61s -> 3847.19s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Do I need to show down time for dying? All right. I'm going to
[3847.19s -> 3855.34s]  move him out of the way. Here it goes. We have these, this guy, let's take these guys out first.
[3855.34s -> 3862.28s]  I'm not fucking around anymore. Let's go. These guys all got to die. What are you looking at?
[3862.92s -> 3877.70s]  Us. All right. Get the bag out. Hide in the bush and then we're going to go. This guy's dead.
[3877.70s -> 3883.77s]  Okay. Throw it out there now. What the fuck was that? What was that? I was trying to throw the
[3883.77s -> 3900.92s]  briefcase. Who needs the fucking briefcase? Just stab him in the head. All right. Pick this up.
[3901.48s -> 3909.02s]  Gotta love bits. Are we killing bandits? Why would they love bandits? Okay. Does that guy dead?
[3909.82s -> 3913.74s]  I smell trouble. I hear for a second. Where's his eyesight? All right. We'll go over here.
[3915.11s -> 3931.26s]  This is only temporary. Something on that I don't like. Get in there. Safe up here. Safe. Only one
[3931.26s -> 3936.22s]  at a time though, please. Shall we continue? You stay in the bush. Let's see what's happening here.
[3936.22s -> 3938.54s]  Okay. I'm going to throw. We're going to throw a coin right here.
[3941.45s -> 3949.43s]  You hear that? Watch and learn. Okay. He's dead. Anybody else? We're good. All right.
[3949.43s -> 3955.59s]  Let's go. Not sure where this is going. Let's keep our distance. Back in business. Now, only one of
[3955.59s -> 3960.39s]  you go down here to the dynamite, except you need this shit. Here, come here. Looks like we're past
[3960.39s -> 3967.19s]  Denver. You go up here and hide in a bush. You come down here and you refill your ammo and then
[3967.19s -> 3974.74s]  get the dynamite. Got it. Okay. I'm ready. I'm going to throw this. Oh, but there's a guy I could
[3974.74s -> 3991.08s]  like punch. It's now or never. I've missed the fuse. Now run. I'm in the bush.
[3997.48s -> 3999.00s]  Good thing we got more dynamite.
[3999.56s -> 4013.59s]  Hey, now we're good. Right? He's in a bush. He's in a bush. Why do they know what bush he's in?
[4021.11s -> 4027.27s]  Fuck you. Okay. I've missed the fuse. Better throw it fast.
[4032.79s -> 4039.35s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait. Oh my goodness. Did you see that? Holy shit. I killed everybody. I killed
[4039.99s -> 4048.68s]  everybody freaking out. Let's find a safe spot. Good thing we got more dynamite. Okay.
[4050.28s -> 4057.91s]  You better have a plan. All right. Now what? Play the tunnel. Meet up at the meeting spot.
[4058.47s -> 4068.34s]  I got a feeling about. Oh, I can save these people. Oh, you're both going different ways.
[4074.82s -> 4079.13s]  Just what I had in mind. Don't get in the way. This guy has a shovel. He's not going to threat.
[4080.07s -> 4087.35s]  This is the guy that's the threat. My thoughts exactly.
[4087.99s -> 4092.23s]  Bring it on. Here it goes. Edit and then save the civilians.
[4093.27s -> 4100.86s]  I'll take that. Let's make it quick. All right. You're free. Don't take it personal.
[4100.86s -> 4104.94s]  Keep your hands down. Nice. We'll take care of the pain. That's what I did it. That's a
[4105.66s -> 4111.51s]  secondary objective. Not a problem. Meeting point. Let's go. All right.
[4114.33s -> 4118.73s]  All right. Here it is. Let's deal with the rest of them. My thoughts exactly.
[4119.29s -> 4125.51s]  What is this game? This is Desperado's three. And so far, this is actually pretty fun.
[4127.37s -> 4132.09s]  Guess you made the David company happy today. How much do you get for a job like this?
[4133.27s -> 4141.02s]  Hope you're not expecting a cut. Relax. I got what I need. This counts as a plus
[4141.02s -> 4145.58s]  full letter grade, by the way, if I can drive the car, which is a horse got to make good on time.
[4146.54s -> 4154.36s]  Like I said, please, I got an appointment. I'd like to keep suits yourself.
[4157.77s -> 4162.33s]  Right. I mean, if I can fall sprint the horse into bad guys, you McCoy have to give it a full
[4162.33s -> 4172.94s]  letter. Sure. If you need a professional, you know who to send for. Good day, Mr. Cooper.
[4173.58s -> 4177.40s]  Wait, we're losing them. That guy was so useful.
[4183.80s -> 4192.74s]  Owen Wilson team up. Oh, I didn't get this one. Don't save during the mission. Don't use fire
[4192.74s -> 4199.56s]  arms. Complete the mission in under five minutes. The mission on hard. Well, I got two out of three.
[4200.44s -> 4204.79s]  This always is the most obnoxious thing. And I hate seeing this in every iPad game.
[4205.67s -> 4209.11s]  Two stars is like, holy shit, dude, come on. You were so close to the three.
[4209.99s -> 4214.62s]  One star means you don't care. And you don't have any fucking in game currency shit.
[4215.18s -> 4220.30s]  Two is you probably bought in game currency shit, but you used it so poorly that you still couldn't
[4220.30s -> 4232.52s]  get to three stars. That pisses me off seeing that. Wait a minute. Hold on. What you can
[4236.30s -> 4252.97s]  tells you everything you did. This is awesome. All right. Where do we go from here? Why is this
[4252.97s -> 4264.90s]  money explosions? You're going to see when I compulsively had to throw somebody off the cliff.
[4264.90s -> 4290.39s]  Does this take into account all the saves? Save one save number three. Wait, what happened up there?
[4290.39s -> 4316.94s]  What? What exploded? I feel like I'm playing like a Gario. Holy shit. That was awesome. Nice.
[4316.94s -> 4331.29s]  Let's see. That's so cool. Eight saves. Twenty two. What's that? Twenty two. What was he on fire?
[4331.29s -> 4335.06s]  Does that mean he did better if he was the better teammate? OK,
[4338.02s -> 4345.75s]  let's save in the replay. Twenty two saves, eight loads. Oh, that's cool. Thirty three minutes,
[4347.50s -> 4355.50s]  seven shots, three dynamites and stabs kills thirty alarm. Enemies killed. There's only two
[4355.50s -> 4367.38s]  people left on the whole map alive. That kind of bad. The star is five minutes. Yeah, no way.
[4368.02s -> 4381.21s]  All right, we got Devil's Canyon. Yes, pass and then Flagstone. Do you feel the game is too hard?
[4383.13s -> 4388.01s]  No, I don't want to adjust. John Cooper has come to Flagstone to meet an old friend. Doesn't take
[4388.01s -> 4395.38s]  long for trouble to arrive. I just beat the first level in thirty three minutes. Do you think I'm
[4395.38s -> 4402.76s]  having not that much trouble? Troublemakers in Flagstone. Nestled between the peaks of the
[4402.76s -> 4408.04s]  Colorado Rockies lies the small town of Flagstone. Store owners, farmers, blacksmiths and barkeepers
[4408.04s -> 4412.76s]  all go about their daily business. Workers of the David Company mingle with the locals as they
[4412.76s -> 4418.28s]  continue to build the new railroad through town. As Cooper arrives in Flagstone, he heads straight
[4418.28s -> 4423.64s]  for the saloon, which is empty except for a few regulars. The barmaid pours a glass of whiskey in
[4423.64s -> 4428.60s]  the nurse. The nurse, he nurses it while he waits for an old friend. Can't fucking read anymore.
[4428.60s -> 4440.47s]  They tore down old Williams House the other day. Call the sheriff. Now, why do they have to do that?
[4440.47s -> 4446.23s]  Can't they lay their tracks between our homes? Actually bad. Stick to the game, will you? Yeah,
[4446.23s -> 4453.03s]  I'm just saying they ever come to my house. I'll show these railroad thugs whose balls. Oh, shit.
[4453.03s -> 4458.87s]  Well, what can I do for you, gentlemen? Oh, we'll get to you in a minute. You know the drill.
[4458.87s -> 4465.11s]  Everybody out. Yes, sir. Game of cards. It always looks like this. Oh, you keep fucking track of
[4465.11s -> 4469.91s]  who's who. Something in your ears. Just finishing my drink. Better dealer, man. You gotta go to a
[4469.91s -> 4481.96s]  better banker in Monopoly. We own this town now. So when he says out. Look at me. We don't like
[4482.04s -> 4490.95s]  troublemakers around here. Who do we have here? Well, you got double trouble now.
[4491.91s -> 4500.89s]  What the hell? You again? Is the doctor. Wait, he's on my team.
[4502.65s -> 4509.30s]  They're running away. I can't blame them. Poor guys had to look at your ugly mug.
[4509.30s -> 4515.94s]  Oh, you're welcome. You need a drink. Is it like a giant sword? A bow and arrow?
[4516.50s -> 4525.54s]  Yours is on the house. The big axle for a car. You really shouldn't. They'll kill you next time.
[4527.14s -> 4532.49s]  They can try. I guess you've been here a while. Spent your time pissing off the wrong people,
[4532.49s -> 4538.01s]  huh? I'm the one that pissed off. But as you're here, maybe we can work together.
[4538.01s -> 4542.01s]  Oh, no, you're not dragging me into this. He shot that guy. I'm here for Frank.
[4542.09s -> 4547.14s]  Surround the place. Don't let them get away. Amigo, you're already in it. And besides,
[4547.14s -> 4553.78s]  you owe me one. All right, let's get out of here. Come on out the back. The guy's dabbing. Of
[4553.78s -> 4557.94s]  course you would say that. That's okay. I mean, of course that that's what's happening.
[4564.86s -> 4570.30s]  It's a bloodborne weapon. That's so funny. All right, let's go. What's his special power?
[4572.52s -> 4579.10s]  They're here somewhere. And we got all the time in the world. Well, these guys are out for blood.
[4579.10s -> 4586.38s]  The Monster Hunter. Part of the David company. I've scores to settle with a few of them.
[4587.18s -> 4594.68s]  Cooper, find any green teeth. I need it. I'm trying to turn this into a poison weapon. Sure.
[4594.68s -> 4599.96s]  Let's head for the street. Nobody will bother us if we stay among the townsfolk. So we got room to
[4599.96s -> 4611.30s]  breathe. So far so good. But whose heads are we bashing in? First, we got Jarvis here. We're tough
[4611.30s -> 4617.80s]  guys. Right now he's in that backyard trying to ride that just kill him. That's just gonna kill
[4617.80s -> 4623.80s]  him anyway. Next is Wilde March. She's on the first floor of the flagstone brothel. Oh, this is
[4623.80s -> 4633.29s]  awesome. Whiskey and watching the girls. This is gonna be so awesome. I can't wait. Then there's
[4633.29s -> 4643.38s]  the Duke. He's making rounds with his bootlickers up and down Church Street. And last is the former
[4643.38s -> 4650.66s]  people don't have to kill. He's a real asshole had his men tear down half the towns that he
[4650.66s -> 4656.66s]  doesn't have to plan around it. So we get rid of them. Head back to the saloon and finish our
[4656.66s -> 4661.86s]  drinks. That ain't much of a plan. Hector. Why do you think I've waited for you? All right.
[4662.42s -> 4666.74s]  Let's get it over with. I have to sneak around. Am I allowed to be in this town? What's the matter
[4666.74s -> 4677.50s]  with these guys? Well, now I don't have to sneak. Right. I guys live here. Hector can whistle to
[4677.50s -> 4686.17s]  lure guards towards his current location. It's a trap. He can place Bianca, a giant but surprisingly
[4686.17s -> 4697.38s]  stealthy bear trap. Hector is smart. So Hector likes to combine his skills. That seems really,
[4697.38s -> 4702.90s]  really morbid. Just unnecessary and completely inappropriate. Why don't you just learn how to
[4702.90s -> 4709.46s]  fucking shoot a gun? I say it's time to use Bianca. You still carry that thing around. I have a
[4709.46s -> 4720.10s]  reputation to keep. Time to use Bianca. Let's lure someone into your embrace. Get your shit
[4720.10s -> 4733.00s]  together. Hector, it don't work. Can we get this over with? We're not done yet, amigo. I'll use my
[4733.00s -> 4747.18s]  singing voice. I do it. You got it, amigo. Sing. Sing. Is he even gonna step in it? Don't think
[4747.18s -> 4756.04s]  you can hide. Who needs a haircut? Yeah, I got it. You better leave Blackstone before I find you.
[4761.08s -> 4765.16s]  Super, the trap didn't work. Trust me, it doesn't usually go like this.
[4768.23s -> 4777.43s]  Wait, isn't that the main bad guy? Oh, come on. What? That's the main bad guy.
[4781.82s -> 4791.80s]  I just need a few seconds. Don't let them get away. We gotta smoke them out. Let's make it quick.
[4793.40s -> 4799.29s]  Who needs no bloody? I knew I was right to bring you along.
[4799.29s -> 4803.69s]  Sure glad I'm meeting your expectations. We got troublemakers here. Keep your eyes to you.
[4803.69s -> 4810.17s]  I need this back. Where are they? Keep looking. Gotta find them. Fucking three-head. What?
[4810.17s -> 4818.86s]  Fuckers. Whoever finds them gets their stuff. It's so lame. What about T? What's T do?
[4820.14s -> 4825.99s]  Good stuff. Oh, I can heal Hector. I'm in the mood for some chopping. They gotta be around here
[4825.99s -> 4836.66s]  somewhere. Yeah, that's right. You run home to mama. Give me this back. On my way. She looks ready for
[4836.66s -> 4844.66s]  more. I see you. Fuck. Why does this keep happening? Hiding in there. It's the two chokers.
[4844.66s -> 4852.66s]  What is he saying? Drink, drink, drink, drink. I think you're clever. I found you.
[4858.30s -> 4875.03s]  Whoa. What? He's Estus chugging. Can't even say it. It's so stupid.
[4884.54s -> 4887.90s]  We already know what happens here. What's wrong with my voice? Okay, this is what I'm talking about.
[4887.90s -> 4893.58s]  Nobody move. Nobody talk. Nobody say anything. This is permanently... I've turned into Tom Hanks.
[4893.58s -> 4897.66s]  Somehow I just turned into Tom Hanks because my voice has changed a little because I was drinking
[4897.66s -> 4903.42s]  water. Let me tell you, I loved working on Toy Story. It was one of my favorite movies working
[4903.42s -> 4907.66s]  on. Favorite film. I love being Woody. He's the best character I've ever done work with.
[4908.38s -> 4917.02s]  And I'll tell you, Tim Allen with Buzzkill, he was great. He was great. He was great, Tom.
[4922.62s -> 4936.94s]  I'll never get that again. Hiding here. He was never really here to begin with. All right,
[4936.94s -> 4942.41s]  let me get this right. How would you not see a gigantic bear trap on the ground? Okay,
[4942.49s -> 4947.29s]  put it like right there. It wants me to seriously learn how to do this.
[4953.53s -> 4954.97s]  Okay, we're still here?
[4955.21s -> 4956.25s]  Time to make some noise.
[4971.48s -> 4975.45s]  Yeah, still fresh. All right, get it back. We're good. Save it.
[4979.72s -> 4984.04s]  Let's take a look at the plan here. Okay, we got two guys here.
[4984.92s -> 4988.20s]  He can't hide forever. Make it this way. Let's check and see. Let's take a look at what he's
[4988.20s -> 5002.86s]  looking at. All right, he's got a big radius. Where's he go? All right, he goes, he turns his
[5002.86s -> 5008.70s]  back. How's our opportunity? Go. Remember, leave the big guy to me. He got you once already.
[5008.70s -> 5017.62s]  He's all yours. Where do you look? Are we safer? We have to be, right? Long coats. Yeah, the most
[5017.62s -> 5022.42s]  dangerous enemies. Hector is the only one that can take them down by himself with his axe or his
[5022.42s -> 5032.02s]  bare fists. That's good to know. That's why he didn't step in the trap. I'm going to show down
[5032.02s -> 5036.42s]  this. I'm going to wait. Can we get this? He's going to stab this guy in the back. He's going
[5036.42s -> 5042.97s]  to go for him and have the axe. Yeah, they couldn't have slipped through. Let's get going.
[5042.97s -> 5054.07s]  Go down mode. Is he immune to guns? I mean, he has to be right. All right, time for a showdown.
[5056.57s -> 5061.13s]  You are going to go stab him in the back. Come on. Hector, you are going to go over here.
[5061.13s -> 5067.45s]  Nobody messes with Hector. What are you going to do? What is he going to do?
[5068.74s -> 5073.86s]  Whistle? Hector, you're going to whistle. I'll use my singing voice. Yep. And then you're going to
[5073.86s -> 5086.06s]  hide. Whistle. Let's go. Oh, my God. You fucking did it. Just a scratch.
[5087.98s -> 5103.64s]  It's so quick. How come we didn't whistle? I have to click it? I thought it was like,
[5103.64s -> 5109.00s]  OK, I'm so I'm in showstopper mode. You're ready. So like whistles my singing whistle. OK,
[5109.00s -> 5112.86s]  I get it. You have to actually do it. You're going to go over there and you're stabbing the
[5112.86s -> 5118.62s]  knife. And then you are going to just like the Sims. If I haven't do something else,
[5118.62s -> 5134.73s]  we do it. Time for the X. Let's lure someone in. Is this place just a scratch? Why is he a bear?
[5134.73s -> 5143.30s]  What's going on? Are you behind this door, Sonny? Don't move an inch.
[5143.78s -> 5148.18s]  Who needs a haircut? Hey, it's the two jokers. Who the fuck are you?
[5152.18s -> 5162.54s]  OK, I have to I got to lower him again. This strategy is not going to work. OK. I mean,
[5162.54s -> 5174.38s]  we could turn him around and go this way. Come on. It'll be fun. Keep your head down. I just need a
[5174.38s -> 5184.90s]  few seconds. Throw it over there. Put a cork in it. What the fuck? And then wrap around this way.
[5185.78s -> 5193.64s]  I can't kill him. Turn up the long coat. Isn't that going to make a huge bunch of noise?
[5197.64s -> 5213.19s]  Stop being bad. I've been that guy for 10 minutes. Come on, amigo. No, I need to. OK, I know. I have
[5213.19s -> 5219.53s]  to coin him and then kill him. All day. We go. Ready? Lots of these point him heads or tails.
[5219.53s -> 5228.95s]  Kill him. Not worth it. I do it again later. Oh, you can kill people, too. That's good. Well,
[5228.95s -> 5235.77s]  I'm getting thirsty, Murdoch. I can't hide forever, Sam. Let's do this. Get your shit together.
[5236.65s -> 5248.12s]  How's it going? Shall we? Let's do this again. Go time. Ready? What? Oh, you son of a bitch.
[5250.12s -> 5257.61s]  Fucking restart the goddamn thing. Just use the axe. He's going to but he's going to see that.
[5260.46s -> 5264.86s]  I got lots of that over here. Come on. You come over here and use the axe on these guys.
[5265.82s -> 5270.70s]  I like it. Oh, sure. Knock yourself.
[5275.38s -> 5278.34s]  All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.
[5278.34s -> 5285.82s]  Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. You're going to go. You're going to go this way.
[5286.62s -> 5291.02s]  You're going to go. Actors here. Act them right in the head. I'm in this way, amigo.
[5291.02s -> 5295.58s]  And then you're going to distract them. Throw a coin right behind all this trick in the book.
[5295.58s -> 5297.58s]  Okay. Check this shit out. Go. Let's go.
[5298.06s -> 5299.58s]  Fucking idiot.
[5306.23s -> 5311.67s]  Not your lucky day. Don't let them get away. You got it, amigo. Anybody find anything?
[5313.05s -> 5314.97s]  Time for the axe. Time to go.
[5321.64s -> 5325.80s]  True. I was ready to bring it along. Sure. Glad I'll meet your expectations.
[5326.76s -> 5331.16s]  It's like slaughtering people. All right. We have to stop doing this.
[5347.38s -> 5355.98s]  Why do they keep reviving him? I put the bear trap down right here and then you're
[5356.14s -> 5359.58s]  going to do it. I didn't pick the knife up. I'll get close and personal.
[5359.58s -> 5363.34s]  All right. Just no, no, no. Just put it down. Who do we have here? I'll run.
[5364.68s -> 5372.65s]  What's he doing? Run. Run. You fucking moron. Someone's about to lose a few teeth.
[5374.18s -> 5376.02s]  All right. Kill him. I have to kill this guy.
[5378.52s -> 5391.24s]  Someone needs to get things done. Oh shit. Time for the axe. Okay. I'm good. We did it.
[5392.12s -> 5401.40s]  I made it. All right. She looks ready for more. How do I hide all these guys?
[5401.40s -> 5413.98s]  I don't think I can throw them down the well. Yeah, I'm ready. This is nothing over there.
[5413.98s -> 5424.79s]  No problem. Can't do it. Can't throw them in the well. Why? Look, I killed everybody that would
[5424.79s -> 5436.98s]  be showing up over here anyway. Does it really matter? Forget it. I can do this all day.
[5437.54s -> 5444.71s]  It does. Yes. Okay. All right. I'm doing it. This bush is going to stink after a few days,
[5444.71s -> 5449.32s]  by the way. This is going to be the smelliest bush ever. People are going to be like,
[5449.32s -> 5452.92s]  holy shit, someone's going to pull that up. What's wrong with that bush? It smells so bad.
[5456.50s -> 5473.54s]  That's a problem. I can handle it. Let's light this up. Okay. The game is saved. We're good.
[5475.14s -> 5480.26s]  And that was tricky. Yeah. How many people? All right. So now I can be in the town with it.
[5481.14s -> 5485.86s]  Civil zones. Characters can move through civil zones undetected. As long as they don't act
[5485.86s -> 5490.34s]  suspicious, the red marker will indicate when you're about to leave or enter a civil zone.
[5491.06s -> 5500.87s]  Here we go. Look, it's now we're just normal people. Hey, look at that. Civil first on your
[5500.87s -> 5506.31s]  list. How about we just kill them in the order we like. Great plan. You have there. You heard
[5506.31s -> 5509.43s]  what happened with the church bell the other day. So who's on the list?
[5510.79s -> 5517.83s]  Okay. Kill the company thugs. Where's Jarvis? Guy over there. Wild Marge. McBain and the Duke.
[5519.58s -> 5524.92s]  All right. Let's let's head up that way. Follow this guy around.
[5526.14s -> 5531.40s]  Dang. I thought all this would be good for the town. We were so,
[5531.40s -> 5535.24s]  so happy when the mayor told us that the railroad would come. That's the Duke right there.
[5535.80s -> 5540.20s]  Oh, you take a good look. It's the guy running the company. Yeah, he wants to see his
[5541.24s -> 5545.56s]  dog. Doesn't give a doesn't give a shit about it. Yeah, we're just talking.
[5548.84s -> 5556.66s]  Okay. We know friends won't take long. This is outrageous. You can't just
[5556.66s -> 5561.38s]  tear down my house. I'm not going to just do that. I need to have at least somewhat of a plan.
[5561.38s -> 5567.46s]  Where does he go? I want to see. Does he leave a civil zone?
[5568.66s -> 5572.10s]  Okay. Now what if I put a trap right when he comes over here? Will this guy see?
[5572.10s -> 5576.98s]  We, uh, all right, here we go. We're going to try this here because our good friend,
[5577.62s -> 5604.62s]  I think I can get that to work. I really do.
[5605.58s -> 5609.06s]  He's trying to catch a bear. They're walking around it.
[5612.10s -> 5613.94s]  How many of these people are going to look around? What are you looking?
[5615.86s -> 5618.50s]  You're looking straight ahead. You're just a civilian. What? Who cares?
[5618.50s -> 5620.34s]  If you see, you gotta put a bear trap down and get out of here.
[5623.46s -> 5624.82s]  Wait, what's this? What's this bell?
[5627.78s -> 5629.54s]  Wait, I can throw somebody in a coffin.
[5636.02s -> 5647.40s]  I can get over here. This is still a civil zone. I'm allowed to be here.
[5652.87s -> 5654.23s]  This is going to kill anybody that's right there.
[5655.67s -> 5658.31s]  There's so many ways to kill people. Is that going to kill this guy too, right?
[5663.13s -> 5665.05s]  Is he going to walk over here and I'm going to looney tune this guy?
[5669.21s -> 5672.25s]  And I said, shut the fuck up. Yeah, I can. All right. I'm going to.
[5673.37s -> 5676.33s]  Cooper, you go over there. You too. This is a civil zone, right?
[5679.29s -> 5682.33s]  No, it's not. It's not a civil zone anymore. When you go through there,
[5683.37s -> 5692.90s]  is he going to walk through here? Okay. This is not a civil zone anymore. Not yet. Now I want you
[5692.90s -> 5700.09s]  time to go get over here. You don't mind this, right? Only Cooper can climb fucking trees.
[5700.09s -> 5710.66s]  All right. We'll switch. Things are quiet. It's like this. Sure thing. This is outrageous.
[5710.66s -> 5715.46s]  You can't just tear down my house. I'm obviously going to squash this guy.
[5717.45s -> 5721.05s]  Get everybody in the right position. Save the game. All right. I'm going to squash the guy first.
[5721.05s -> 5728.82s]  Relax, amigo. I'm going to sneak over here. Only got one guy right there.
[5729.62s -> 5733.94s]  You're looking this way. You're safe all the way until right here.
[5734.58s -> 5737.59s]  All right. This is where they're laying the tracks.
[5738.31s -> 5743.03s]  McBain's the foreman and doesn't let anyone on site. Let's keep it quiet when we head in.
[5744.17s -> 5748.17s]  He's too talking. I could probably trap this guy if I wanted to.
[5754.14s -> 5756.38s]  What happened? Has this guy walked over here?
[5760.30s -> 5771.00s]  Shit. What? Oh no. God damn it. All right. I got to take these guys out one by one then.
[5771.64s -> 5775.10s]  I'm going to trap right here and I'm going to whistle somebody and someone's going to die.
[5775.10s -> 5781.82s]  Hurry up. Hey there, you. You're enjoying yourself yet, Cooper? This way, amigo.
[5782.78s -> 5787.98s]  This is where they're laying the tracks. McBain's the foreman and doesn't let anyone on site.
[5787.98s -> 5794.54s]  Let's keep it quiet when we head in. Where? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[5795.42s -> 5800.79s]  I can't help but have the fucking wood. They heard that?
[5803.59s -> 5814.30s]  They can see me. Girl, this wood. I have to distract everybody. Okay.
[5815.77s -> 5819.69s]  I can't go through there. You're going up here. Changing you.
[5823.22s -> 5831.14s]  Does anybody care that I'm doing this? I don't think so, right?
[5834.74s -> 5837.06s]  All right. Let's take a look. I got to get up there.
[5838.95s -> 5841.91s]  This guy's looking straight ahead. Who cares? I care about this guy.
[5842.63s -> 5848.54s]  I think I can just knife him right now.
[5851.46s -> 5854.34s]  This guy's fucking dead. Let's go. Nobody else, right?
[5859.02s -> 5861.42s]  This dude is looking straight ahead that way.
[5862.46s -> 5870.98s]  Wait, am I just going to throw the bell at him? What do I do with the bell?
[5873.11s -> 5886.95s]  Oh, I'm going to kill this guy. Here he comes. This guy's dead.
[5900.26s -> 5902.74s]  One down, three to go. What about the coffin?
[5905.54s -> 5911.02s]  These guys didn't even care. Can I throw them in the coffin?
[5911.02s -> 5913.26s]  Why does this coffin exist? Doesn't that seem weird, right?
[5913.98s -> 5923.61s]  What do I do? All right. I'm jumping down. Wait.
[5936.34s -> 5938.18s]  Okay. Now, wait, wait, wait. Are these guys coming?
[5939.58s -> 5940.54s]  Now he's going to check the roof.
[5949.62s -> 5955.78s]  I'm really going to have to sneak through here, aren't I? I might have to go a different way.
[5966.55s -> 5972.26s]  Okay. Now I'm going to get, this is the only guy that stays down here. That was my fault.
[5972.26s -> 5977.96s]  Yeah. Well, just hold on and watch. Let's get going. Can't you jump off the roof?
[5978.44s -> 5984.62s]  And I'm going to sneak behind this guy, knock him out and I'm going to bury him.
[6009.27s -> 6016.65s]  A lot of people can fit in here, apparently. Okay. Anything else?
[6018.09s -> 6020.65s]  I have to actually be careful here. There's one guy pointing this way. I'm just going to
[6020.65s -> 6033.96s]  hide. I'm going to climb back around. Clown coffin. What are you doing? All right. That's
[6033.96s -> 6057.77s]  one dead. We need three more. Do they know? Go over there and distract them. Do something.
[6062.07s -> 6068.87s]  Okay. Now come down. We're good. All right. That's one down.
[6068.87s -> 6077.18s]  Here we go. Maybe we can't do that one yet. Maybe I have to wait.
[6080.02s -> 6086.18s]  Climb up there. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[6086.18s -> 6092.58s]  I thought all this would be good for the town. We were so, so happy when the mayor told us.
[6092.58s -> 6095.30s]  German doesn't read this message. I will eat my barbecue chicken. Well, now you've got to figure
[6095.30s -> 6099.94s]  out something else to eat. It's the guy running the company. Wait, wait, if German doesn't read
[6099.94s -> 6107.30s]  this message, I will eat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. This is the, we got to probably have to like
[6107.30s -> 6121.50s]  poison this guy or something. I mean, I could, I could just throw an axe at him, right?
[6123.98s -> 6134.01s]  Is there a place to hide? Is there a bush right here somewhere? I could just throw something at
[6134.01s -> 6141.05s]  him. Oh, these are a little, okay. These are little helpers.
[6147.29s -> 6157.00s]  Tom's up there. All right. Let's go. What do I do about this guy? Just kill him and run. Sniping
[6157.00s -> 6167.66s]  spot. I don't think I can shoot that far. Sure thing. I'm down here. Who's this? All right. Let's
[6167.66s -> 6170.78s]  go check this guy out. We're probably going to be able to knock him off the thing and kill him.
[6170.78s -> 6180.09s]  Right. Understood. You got it, amigo. Too many guards for some backyard corral. Jarvis and his
[6180.09s -> 6185.69s]  man hang around here. Only one guy. What do you mean? One person. All right. Time for distractions.
[6185.69s -> 6194.87s]  We're in. Point. Heads or tails. Come on. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[6194.87s -> 6200.55s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Show stop. I got a plan. Okay.
[6201.03s -> 6210.15s]  I'm here. Put this shit down right here. Bianca. And then you're going to roll a coin. I just need
[6210.15s -> 6213.59s]  a few seconds. Right here. Just for a second so we can get some time to figure this out.
[6217.59s -> 6220.79s]  And you and I. Wait. Show stop. Show town. Whatever. Just stop it again.
[6221.43s -> 6229.42s]  I don't know. I need another coin. Ready? Oldest year goes.
[6230.06s -> 6232.23s]  Get in.
[6236.23s -> 6238.23s]  Okay. Now what?
[6240.23s -> 6244.23s]  I can just go over there. I think I can just kill him.
[6255.77s -> 6265.30s]  No one's going to even step on that. Piss off the bull. Yeah. I mean how?
[6266.26s -> 6273.98s]  Do I just fire a gun? Okay. I'm going to fire a gun. Just shoot and the bull's going to freak out.
[6274.78s -> 6281.14s]  Throw a coin at the bull. I'm not going to shoot the bull. I'm going to just shoot it in the air.
[6285.83s -> 6292.50s]  You're not going to walk in it? God damn it.
[6302.31s -> 6313.51s]  I know they're here. We're like every time at El Paso. I have to go get this dumb thing.
[6316.73s -> 6321.77s]  I just need a few seconds. We have to get. I have to get up here and then throw a coin from here.
[6322.49s -> 6328.57s]  It's possible that I could hit it from here though. Let's see. When it gets on, I'll try it.
[6333.13s -> 6338.63s]  Why would a bull give a shit about a coin sound? Do it now? Doesn't he have to be riding it?
[6343.88s -> 6346.68s]  Doesn't he ride it? I'm trying to like have him break his neck, right?
[6349.88s -> 6361.46s]  I'm just getting warm. You hear me? Next time I'll have you watch heads or tails.
[6362.26s -> 6368.76s]  That didn't work. Let's raise some hell. Okay. Then we're ready for it.
[6372.04s -> 6382.07s]  It's not scaring them. It's not scary. The bull's not scared. You guys that have
[6383.27s -> 6393.35s]  everybody was telling me to throw a coin at the bull. Shoot them. I we're like every time
[6393.35s -> 6396.39s]  at El Paso. All right. Well, that's not going to work. We have to find something else that has to
[6396.39s -> 6405.96s]  happen. Hit the bull. So I got to sneak back there. So this guy has to die. Okay. I'm ready.
[6405.96s -> 6417.14s]  It's now or never. I just need a few seconds. Not worth my time. Hey, it's the two chokers.
[6419.66s -> 6432.79s]  Here it goes. The coin. No, I have to sneak around and hit the bull. What's up? I just need a few
[6432.79s -> 6440.84s]  seconds. Let's get going in it. He's so slow. That's the problem. All right. Let's go save
[6442.15s -> 6452.73s]  kill these two. I can't just run and shoot them. The whole game attacks you. All right. Hold on.
[6452.73s -> 6455.98s]  That's good moving amigo. I'll use my singing voice.
[6460.60s -> 6463.56s]  Don't let him get you boss. You know, I'm going to walk over here.
[6464.28s -> 6474.09s]  Okay. Come on. What? Oh, it's he's got a poncho on. I have. He has to just die.
[6474.97s -> 6481.46s]  Can we get this over with? Let's lure someone in.
[6483.54s -> 6487.62s]  Get on with it. This guy's going to walk over getting a bit crowded. Sure thing.
[6490.70s -> 6503.37s]  Get over here. What? Nobody messes with that. Make some noise. I like it. I heard that
[6505.06s -> 6510.10s]  the more the merrier. Why won't he walk over here? This guy doesn't have a poncho on.
[6512.38s -> 6516.46s]  This guy has a poncho on. This guy doesn't have a poncho on. Why is he not listening?
[6516.46s -> 6522.12s]  Throw a coin at the trap. That's not going to do anything. Lots of these.
[6522.84s -> 6528.30s]  Okay. Here's the chance. Here's here. Keep your eyes. I'll use my singing voice.
[6530.30s -> 6545.40s]  What? Still got it. Let's do this. David, why don't you go get him?
[6546.12s -> 6555.21s]  Had to drag me into this. All right. Yeah, I'll get that. I need that. There she is.
[6556.01s -> 6560.09s]  All right. Let's fucking kill this asshole right here. Right now. Time to use Bianca.
[6560.09s -> 6562.81s]  Might have a poncho, but that doesn't particularly fucking hike in the head.
[6564.25s -> 6569.35s]  Okay. Now I can safely go get you. The other guy's not walking around. Let's go.
[6569.75s -> 6580.36s]  And up. No problem. Let's see.
[6586.42s -> 6588.90s]  Crap again. What do you think? Yeah. Oh yeah. Just like old time,
[6588.90s -> 6591.78s]  that'd be all guys ready. Check this shit out. Once this guy turns around,
[6592.66s -> 6604.57s]  this guy has this patrol. I'm going to, I'm going to whistle him over here. Get out of here. Move.
[6604.57s -> 6617.48s]  Leave. Leave. I just need a few seconds. They won't see us. Let's go. Looks like a job.
[6619.00s -> 6629.58s]  Oh, I heard that. No, I don't want you to come over here. I want you.
[6630.54s -> 6634.86s]  You show that bull who's boss boss. Well, I'll break that.
[6636.78s -> 6640.81s]  There we go. All right. If it doesn't work out, just fucking throw a knife at him.
[6641.77s -> 6648.65s]  Watch and learn. Don't think you can hide. God damn it. Nobody move. Nobody move. Nobody move.
[6648.65s -> 6657.82s]  Just don't move.
[6670.15s -> 6673.99s]  Like I'm making like a fucked up YouTube video proving that he could
[6673.99s -> 6689.78s]  withstand a bear trap. Why would he? Why would you do that? Well, okay.
[6690.58s -> 6694.28s]  We're going to go this way and I got a feeling we'll be able to knock this guy out. I'm going
[6694.28s -> 6698.81s]  to throw a knife at him. This trick in the book and the knife.

[6723.10s -> 6726.78s]  Hey, if you see him, shoot to kill. No one's going to check.
[6727.18s -> 6733.45s]  Stay in here. You got to find him. Anybody find him? I'll smoke him out. I'll be fine.
[6736.07s -> 6739.67s]  Stay the hell stay away from here somewhere. Where are they?
[6739.67s -> 6742.55s]  It's not going to be a soft lock. This is just they're going to go back to normal.
[6746.07s -> 6751.35s]  I know they're here. Sneaky motherfuckers. They got to be around here somewhere.

[9638.86s -> 9642.22s]  Nobody does this thing only guy that has any eyes at all and he can't see right here
[9643.02s -> 9645.18s]  No one's paying attention. This guy's barely paying attention
[9645.82s -> 9659.18s]  Imagine playing desperate three instead of desperate four

[9777.22s -> 9778.92s]  opportunity
[9778.92s -> 9787.64s]  No, come on. So this is why the train had to stop out of town. You'd think the railroad would be good for the folks here
[9788.44s -> 9790.44s]  But then they tore half the place down
[9790.92s -> 9796.68s]  Whoever ordered this wants these people gone. You mean vincent devitt railroad boss if you say so
[9797.64s -> 9799.80s]  Men like him are the reason everything's shit
[9801.24s -> 9824.94s]  Stop doing like frostbite and get down here move with him. You know, I see place this town

[9837.58s -> 9861.64s]  Yeah, I got it I can't kick it down on my way, okay, let's go
[9866.35s -> 9871.02s]  You up for the saloon later?
[9872.54s -> 9875.02s]  Clearly it was the two guys in the room
[9880.62s -> 9883.10s]  Isn't it so clear that it was the guys that were just in the room
[9885.44s -> 9887.88s]  Well, that's our cover

[9988.09s -> 9992.25s]  I'm fine cooper. Let's head back to the saloon. Our drinks are still waiting
[9998.35s -> 10002.48s]  here goes

[10006.56s -> 10009.44s]  You got the amigo coming through
[10010.76s -> 10013.32s]  Dang, I thought all this would be good for the town
[10013.96s -> 10017.64s]  Awesome. I did it. We were so so happy. I did it
[10019.32s -> 10021.80s]  I beat the mission. Everyone thought I wasn't gonna be able to do it
[10033.12s -> 10036.59s]  Gentlemen, I saved your whiskey for you
[10037.31s -> 10041.87s]  I'll make my food here a bit after this. I'm gonna go take care about those men anymore after we save
[10041.95s -> 10043.95s]  I want to see
[10043.95s -> 10046.19s]  We sure could use a little more quiet around here
[10047.21s -> 10052.89s]  Well fellas, I have to step out. Would you mind keeping an eye on the place leave it to us help yourselves?
[10053.13s -> 10055.24s]  I'll be back in a few
[10055.24s -> 10056.28s]  so
[10056.28s -> 10058.28s]  How long you've been here?
[10058.44s -> 10061.48s]  A couple of days. Why are you asking? Did you find him?
[10062.20s -> 10068.68s]  You know where he is. You have to bring this up now. What the hell hector just saying we just had a good time
[10068.76s -> 10075.08s]  So why ruin it, huh? Look i'm not here to play the good samaritan. We both know he's working for david
[10075.16s -> 10077.16s]  So just tell me where he is
[10077.72s -> 10079.72s]  So there's no first person to go
[10081.05s -> 10086.49s]  Last person the last one that was really fun. He's at the mayor's house, although everybody hated it right right up the mountain
[10086.97s -> 10090.97s]  No reason to waste any more time then you sure this is a good idea
[10091.61s -> 10093.63s]  It's getting late
[10093.63s -> 10095.63s]  I put this off long enough
[10096.27s -> 10098.27s]  What difference is one more day?
[10098.91s -> 10101.15s]  Where I know frank he'll still be there tomorrow
[10102.81s -> 10105.45s]  all right
[10105.45s -> 10107.93s]  Tomorrow then that's right amigo
[10109.05s -> 10110.57s]  now
[10110.57s -> 10114.97s]  Tell me what you've been up to. That's a really detailed message. I don't even know what it means. So i'm not going to answer it
[10123.08s -> 10124.80s]  Okay
[10124.80s -> 10126.80s]  Make the deaths look like accidents
[10128.44s -> 10130.44s]  What was the oh the girl?
[10130.70s -> 10136.22s]  Don't kill or knock out anyone in the train track area that didn't happen. Don't touch any bushes or haystacks. How would you do that?
[10138.81s -> 10141.29s]  Kill three mission targets at the same time
[10143.52s -> 10148.65s]  What do you poison her drink?
[10149.87s -> 10151.15s]  obviously
[10151.15s -> 10156.84s]  You then split them up and knock him down with a show stopper and do the coin in the bowl
[10157.56s -> 10163.04s]  See what happened
[10163.04s -> 10169.90s]  But we started here. Okay, we'll do times uh times 16
[10170.54s -> 10178.84s]  I remember this part being really really hard for no reason. I don't know why
[10180.28s -> 10187.66s]  Circled do not do not
[10188.30s -> 10198.60s]  Please do not make
[10198.60s -> 10214.44s]  Thank you. We came all the way back down here
[10215.16s -> 10220.67s]  It's the bull part. Yeah, I didn't do this right
[10221.31s -> 10229.44s]  It's gonna be a lot of saves
[10229.44s -> 10239.69s]  Okay. Now the real four hour long joke here
[10240.33s -> 10245.69s]  Would be if I made sure that i've walked on the map in a way that I've spelled out. Fuck you
[10246.33s -> 10250.24s]  Now that's the real four hour joke
[10250.32s -> 10255.24s]  I'm not sure i'm willing to do it
[10255.24s -> 10257.24s]  And I just play the game and i'm playing terribly
[10257.64s -> 10261.08s]  And everyone's like why is he playing like such shit? This is terrible. Like why is he doing it like this?
[10261.08s -> 10263.08s]  This is like absolutely brainless
[10263.48s -> 10266.04s]  And then at the end you see that I just spelled out. Fuck you
[10268.44s -> 10284.54s]  Maybe too long how many saves 32 reloads or two saves where are they right here?
[10287.64s -> 10291.56s]  All right, hold on because I went is this when I was the one I went back to get the knife
[10293.04s -> 10305.13s]  Right. It's so inefficient
[10324.96s -> 10333.71s]  The life of a camper this would just be embarrassing if you showed this back to me
[10333.71s -> 10335.71s]  If I was playing like call of duty or something
[10336.11s -> 10344.91s]  Did you ever eat it's you need to eat human meat. It's human meat
[10346.14s -> 10349.82s]  I'm not gonna eat. I would never eat human meat. What the fuck are you talking about?
[10358.91s -> 10377.36s]  Not even a little no never not once ever. Hey, we did it
[10377.98s -> 10380.39s]  53 minutes
[10380.39s -> 10382.39s]  65 loads
[10383.48s -> 10385.16s]  That's a lot. Okay
[10385.16s -> 10387.50s]  65
[10387.50s -> 10395.10s]  65 saves. Okay. I seem to like to play as cooper more than any other character, I guess
[10397.98s -> 10402.27s]  What civilian died?
[10402.27s -> 10404.27s]  One civilian died. Who was it?
[10404.59s -> 10415.68s]  I don't know who that is. What if a human was prepared by a master chef?
[10416.73s -> 10419.55s]  No, it's not gonna happen
[10419.63s -> 10422.27s]  All right. I gotta pee when I come back. We're gonna do my food pyramid
[10422.43s -> 10424.59s]  I'm gonna show because everyone was talking shit about what I eat
[10425.39s -> 10427.15s]  Do my food pyramid
[10427.15s -> 10607.73s]  Be right back. So people ask in the pre-streams
[10608.43s -> 10613.34s]  Whatever the thing that happened before I turned on the live stream. We're talking about food
[10614.06s -> 10617.26s]  I was trying to talk my case about how I eat peanut butter
[10618.72s -> 10621.36s]  That's insane. Apparently eating peanut butter is fucking crazy
[10622.08s -> 10624.08s]  Eating peanut butter is like eating humans
[10624.80s -> 10626.40s]  To a lot of you
[10626.40s -> 10630.24s]  But we'll go over we'll talk about it. So I have over here
[10630.96s -> 10634.44s]  Is down you don't hear this fucking music right now
[10635.66s -> 10638.99s]  Okay, let's go. So what do you have in front of you?
[10640.24s -> 10641.52s]  is
[10641.52s -> 10644.12s]  It is a pyramid
[10644.12s -> 10645.32s]  now most
[10645.32s -> 10647.32s]  Really long long time ago
[10647.32s -> 10649.00s]  The pyramid used to be
[10649.00s -> 10653.31s]  Like this, you know, this is back in like the fucking 30s. It was like
[10658.49s -> 10660.49s]  Like this. Well, why is it the weird color?
[10661.05s -> 10666.49s]  This was essentially the food pyramid back in like fucking 1938 or like 1940. Whatever 1950
[10667.13s -> 10675.72s]  I'm gonna select it. Okay. You had bread and beer
[10676.28s -> 10678.28s]  I think my computer crashed
[10684.04s -> 10685.60s]  Fuck
[10685.60s -> 10694.00s]  No, wait, hold on. What the fuck is going on my computer?
[10699.24s -> 10703.79s]  What stop how do I get rid of this?
[10704.59s -> 10718.52s]  Where's the brushes?
[10718.60s -> 10720.80s]  Okay, honestly
[10720.80s -> 10724.64s]  Where's the brush? How do I get rid of this? Holy shit. What the hell was that?
[10726.76s -> 10729.58s]  All right. Anyways, here we go
[10732.38s -> 10737.37s]  What do I eat the least of the thing that I eat the least of let's put it up here
[10737.37s -> 10741.53s]  This is because you a pyramid supposed to be this is what you eat the least of all right, and this is dead serious
[10742.09s -> 10746.57s]  I do not eat anymore really at all. I don't have dairy ever
[10747.21s -> 10749.21s]  Literally ever not ass
[10750.06s -> 10756.04s]  Dairy like milk. I don't eat drink. I don't eat milk. I don't have it fucks me up. I have
[10756.68s -> 10763.56s]  It has now I have intestinal diarrhea problems. So milk does not really do well for me anymore. So up here is milk
[10764.20s -> 10769.63s]  This is this is like milk
[10769.63s -> 10772.27s]  And can we not make it like 600 font, please?
[10774.96s -> 10776.00s]  milk
[10776.00s -> 10779.47s]  Okay
[10779.47s -> 10788.16s]  Milk that's way too fucking small there milk dairy cheese
[10789.98s -> 10797.21s]  I don't eat any of these things really at all anymore. Not good for me. It doesn't do it for me. I can't do it
[10797.61s -> 10806.06s]  That's probably what I eat the least. What about pizza? I don't eat pizza anymore. I don't I really just don't I swear to god
[10806.46s -> 10810.86s]  I promise. All right. What do I eat the most of what I here's what I eat the most of
[10811.61s -> 10817.95s]  I most of my food comes from shit. This is kind of weird like the biggest
[10818.67s -> 10827.16s]  It's not bread bread's like here. This is i'm gonna make this would be bread
[10829.72s -> 10835.00s]  I don't really eat bread. I try to always stay away from white bread wheat bread. That doesn't sit well with me either
[10836.17s -> 10841.21s]  Also all these medical problems. I've been trying to have a better diet, but I never really ate that much bread anyways
[10842.97s -> 10849.08s]  It's chocolate milk. No, not milk. I don't drink milk. So this would be bread
[10852.00s -> 10853.52s]  and flour
[10853.52s -> 10859.93s]  Bread and flour what bread flour pasta?
[10861.31s -> 10866.62s]  I don't eat. I don't eat it. And then the next thing
[10870.14s -> 10885.20s]  Okay, what I eat the most probably turkey. Yeah, it's definitely tur I eat turkeys number one turkey
[10886.60s -> 10894.04s]  Uh, yeah, definitely turkey. I have turkey for four times a week
[10896.38s -> 10904.36s]  Four three or four times a week. I will eat turkey but also turkey and chicken I think are on this list here
[10907.82s -> 10913.05s]  No, no, it's not even true. That's really not it. That's a lie turkey. I eat the most turkeys all turkey
[10913.45s -> 10924.81s]  I'm a huge turkey guy. All right. Well, I can't move this but whatever you get the idea the poultry
[10925.50s -> 10930.86s]  Yeah, but I eat turkey way more than chicken just because turkey's a lot leaner doesn't have a lot of fat in it
[10930.94s -> 10933.82s]  It's just much better for you. It's I like it. I love it a whisk captain crunch
[10934.84s -> 10939.95s]  Okay, i'm gonna show you guys what I might what it used to be. This is what it is now healthy
[10939.95s -> 10952.49s]  I'm trying to be a healthy person. I will show you what my food pyramid used to be I promise up here
[10953.60s -> 10959.90s]  You've got probably fish salmon tuna. Let's do that
[10960.46s -> 10965.20s]  Salmon's pink. So I eat a shitload of salmon. I'd eat a shitload of tuna
[10965.36s -> 10972.54s]  I eat a lot of it. I eat more turkey than I eat tuna. You know, i'm gonna write fish
[10975.60s -> 10977.21s]  there fish
[10977.21s -> 10978.73s]  Turkey number one
[10978.73s -> 10984.97s]  My main source of food is turkey and then fish and then right here underneath that you got your vegetables. This is green vegetables kale
[10985.51s -> 11000.14s]  Broccoli spinach. I'm a huge baby kale fan. Let's do that. So that's like about right here fill that in
[11000.54s -> 11002.78s]  I'm trying to i'm really trying to be accurate with this
[11004.08s -> 11009.84s]  Greens there green. Yeah, there's a lot of greens
[11014.17s -> 11017.13s]  And then there's a whole lot of shit in here that it kind of doesn't exist
[11019.68s -> 11022.96s]  I do really eat just like a bunch of green vegetables fish and turkey
[11026.08s -> 11030.16s]  And then also very important right underneath this is nuts and seeds
[11031.72s -> 11036.04s]  I want to change this color because I like this. This is more of like a bread and pasta color
[11038.19s -> 11040.68s]  Yeah, like that's better
[11040.68s -> 11046.33s]  Up next you got probably fruits. I eat a shitload of bananas
[11046.41s -> 11049.85s]  I shoot a little blueberries bananas are my favorite thing in the world. You're eating a there's a bird diet
[11050.17s -> 11059.16s]  Not it was not a bird diet yet bird diet would be seeds down here. I eat turkey. I eat the birds
[11060.51s -> 11065.47s]  I mean it is a bird diet because I eat mostly birds. So is that if that's what you meant then that's fine
[11068.57s -> 11070.57s]  Why am I getting to like the scared face?
[11071.61s -> 11075.21s]  You guys probably eat like a six piece chicken nugget three times a week
[11075.21s -> 11078.70s]  What are you talking about? Because I used to do that. I'm telling you we're gonna do my neck. We're gonna do my
[11079.24s -> 11085.52s]  Before pyramid, this is the after pyramid. Okay, so up here you have
[11086.44s -> 11090.81s]  Next is this is fruits. No, that's a fucking lie
[11091.45s -> 11096.49s]  That is such a lie. I'm just that's that's absolutely pretending. I eat maybe like one or two bananas
[11097.13s -> 11105.84s]  A week or something. It's probably up here. That's a lie. I'm gonna i'm just lying to you. Is it gonna be fruits?
[11106.56s -> 11113.21s]  All right, this is fruits
[11113.21s -> 11117.00s]  And then I gotta think of like servings a day, right?
[11117.56s -> 11121.96s]  Because why is that so powerful looking?
[11121.96s -> 11127.85s]  Okay. All right. There you go. Then you got greens your fish your turkey your fruit your bread your flour your milk
[11128.57s -> 11130.41s]  Your nuts and your seeds
[11130.41s -> 11140.33s]  Okay nuts and seeds, but probably go right above fruit. That's the nuts and seeds right there. Okay, here we go
[11140.97s -> 11143.37s]  By the way, this is almonds
[11143.45s -> 11148.33s]  No, fuck that's a lie. Oh, no, wait a minute is is it I think I think it's above greens
[11149.52s -> 11156.57s]  It is it definitely is I eat so much peanut butter all the time. Like it's definitely it's definitely peanut butter up here
[11156.57s -> 11177.50s]  It has to be this is fake. This is peanut butter. It's not greens. It's peanut butter. How do I this is
[11178.22s -> 11179.60s]  peanut butter
[11179.60s -> 11182.64s]  Sunflower seeds nuts and seeds and you know what?
[11183.26s -> 11190.91s]  90% of this is peanut butter. I love it. I love it so much. All right, you get the point
[11198.89s -> 11202.97s]  Well, it's not all peanut butter it's mostly peanut butter i'm just gonna say nuts and seeds
[11207.32s -> 11211.88s]  Okay, then it's vegetables. All right, there we go. Now I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[11211.88s -> 11219.05s]  Yeah, we're good. We're good. We're good and it's greens. Wait, do I eat anything else weird? What do I drink for liquids?
[11222.46s -> 11224.46s]  It's it's probably coffee
[11224.54s -> 11228.22s]  But i'm trying not to drink coffee anymore. So this is the lie. It's crap. No, it's grains
[11228.22s -> 11231.34s]  I eat shit little kale and spinach. You guys know that i've talked about that for years
[11232.06s -> 11238.16s]  Drink liquid. Where is weed?
[11239.56s -> 11245.12s]  Don't I don't what are you talking about? Okay greens
[11245.92s -> 11249.52s]  Because I don't wait greens and radishes
[11250.24s -> 11252.30s]  Okay
[11252.30s -> 11257.47s]  Because I don't eat vegetables. I don't like them. I hate them. I'm just being completely honest
[11258.80s -> 11266.28s]  If it's not a green vegetable, I don't want it. I don't like it. I'm sorry. I'm just being honest. I love broccoli
[11266.82s -> 11268.82s]  spinach kale
[11270.80s -> 11275.90s]  And that's it. I don't like any of that. I don't the carrots are gross. I don't like them. I'm sorry
[11275.90s -> 11281.92s]  I don't like them. I like radishes a lot. I like
[11282.64s -> 11290.97s]  Regular radishes red radishes daikon radishes. I love radishes but onions no fucking no onions and garlic essentially is a condiment
[11291.05s -> 11300.03s]  Okay, i'm gonna put that in condiments. I love radishes. They like the best red radishes are like my favorite
[11300.03s -> 11307.93s]  I love radishes. Okay, the greens and radishes coming up next you got condiments. I eat. Okay
[11307.93s -> 11315.37s]  This is not even a lie either. I think I mean a lot of my diet is like mayonnaise
[11315.77s -> 11329.90s]  I probably eat as much mayonnaise as I do green vegetables. Do I I think I might okay
[11330.86s -> 11346.09s]  I'm gonna write mayonnaise slash condiments. No, that's fucked up. I don't eat that much mayonnaise. Do I?
[11346.73s -> 11351.95s]  Okay, here's the thing. I have to ask do I eat more mayonnaise than I do fruit? Yes
[11352.73s -> 11360.24s]  I am certain of that. I'm telling you right now. That's 100 certain. I absolutely eat more mayonnaise than fruit
[11361.10s -> 11363.34s]  I eat a banana like maybe two or three times a week
[11363.42s -> 11370.30s]  I put mayonnaise on everything in my tuna my fish I mayonnaise on my turkey sandwiches mayonnaise
[11372.03s -> 11381.53s]  In my aiolis mayonnaise all every day mayonnaise plus i'm gonna write mayonnaise plus
[11381.77s -> 11384.73s]  It could be like it'd be like I don't but mustard sucks mayonnaise is the best
[11385.05s -> 11393.47s]  What about peanut butter that goes over here? That's in the nuts and seeds. It's no no wonder you're so sick
[11395.24s -> 11402.84s]  No, I definitely just eat way I eat more. I eat more mayonnaise than fruit. I eat more mayonnaise than dairy
[11402.84s -> 11404.84s]  I eat more mayonnaise than flour and bread
[11405.48s -> 11407.48s]  I don't eat all these other things
[11408.04s -> 11410.60s]  I eat mayonnaise
[11410.68s -> 11415.32s]  More than I do bread. I've had mayonnaise more times in the last week than a piece of bread
[11415.32s -> 11423.68s]  That's a fact and plus who gives it's just whipped up eggs and fucking oil. It's good for you. Just don't eat it every day
[11424.40s -> 11426.83s]  Don't have it in your pyramid. Okay
[11427.55s -> 11434.24s]  Listen that leaves us with I don't know. What else is what else do you eat?
[11436.75s -> 11445.31s]  What what hey what is here what drinks potatoes
[11447.44s -> 11453.05s]  I don't eat I don't eat them. I don't eat potatoes. What about sugar and sweets?
[11455.29s -> 11462.76s]  That's changed recently too. I'm gonna make it like cotton candy color
[11466.08s -> 11470.62s]  I don't I barely eat any like zero
[11474.51s -> 11477.63s]  You want to know where I get my sugar content from at the point at this point right now?
[11477.87s -> 11480.24s]  This is gonna be like I know people are gonna go. Haha
[11480.96s -> 11487.71s]  Yeah from from like whatever is in the marijuana edible that I have I'm sorry, but I have to tell you the truth
[11488.19s -> 11496.78s]  I have to tell you the truth
[11496.78s -> 11499.84s]  There okay
[11499.84s -> 11503.20s]  It's it's right at the top. It did it it won it won the game
[11504.46s -> 11506.46s]  All right. Now what what else do I eat?
[11506.86s -> 11510.22s]  Lots of turkey lots of fish and remember when I write turkey here
[11510.22s -> 11513.42s]  Let's let's I gotta clarify this because people are gonna think i'm fucking psycho
[11513.98s -> 11515.98s]  I will clarify this turkey
[11516.68s -> 11518.68s]  slash poultry
[11521.00s -> 11523.00s]  Oh, how do you spell poultry?
[11523.08s -> 11528.57s]  Because people are gonna be like what the fuck dude eat and you eat you only eat four things. No, no, no, no, this is
[11529.21s -> 11535.32s]  You understand it's mostly turkey deal mostly turkey and poultry like chicken turkey
[11538.19s -> 11545.63s]  I would just write poultry, but I don't want to because 90% of it's turkey. Do you understand? What about rice?
[11546.65s -> 11550.43s]  Oh, uh
[11550.43s -> 11558.64s]  No rice is probably okay. I'm gonna split this this is getting split in half. Oh, no, it's gonna split. Yeah, let's go like this
[11561.34s -> 11565.47s]  This is probably rice
[11565.47s -> 11568.41s]  Uh, what should rice be?
[11568.49s -> 11570.49s]  Let's just do like a like a dark
[11570.73s -> 11582.00s]  Like here, I don't know it's the color of the background shit, um was a good I need about a cup of milk
[11586.59s -> 11609.55s]  God damn it. What the fuck are you doing? Stop? You're ruining everything. Okay. What is pot? What color is pasta?
[11610.91s -> 11612.91s]  Like I want to just do this one. Whatever
[11613.07s -> 11616.68s]  Okay, that's fine. Who cares
[11616.68s -> 11620.84s]  So through what was I doing? Oh, yeah, I was splitting this into thirds because this is rice rice is right here
[11625.96s -> 11627.96s]  Well, I eat more rice than mayonnaise
[11628.96s -> 11630.99s]  I mean, I don't know
[11630.99s -> 11635.26s]  I really don't know
[11635.26s -> 11647.42s]  maybe
[11647.42s -> 11649.42s]  You put mayo on rice
[11650.70s -> 11653.10s]  No, I don't I just know I use it more often
[11654.14s -> 11656.14s]  All right rice is right there
[11656.84s -> 11659.58s]  and
[11659.58s -> 11661.02s]  I definitely eat more
[11661.02s -> 11663.64s]  How do you consume that much mayonnaise?
[11664.96s -> 11667.68s]  This is my weekly pyramid. This is not my daily pyramid
[11668.32s -> 11672.56s]  This is like my like my weekly fuck. That's a lot of mayonnaise. Um
[11673.28s -> 11679.04s]  I'm trying to think about okay. When do I eat mayonnaise in the morning?
[11680.36s -> 11681.88s]  No, where eggs?
[11681.88s -> 11683.71s]  Where eggs?
[11683.71s -> 11685.07s]  Eggs are up here
[11685.07s -> 11687.87s]  I eat eggs
[11687.87s -> 11692.96s]  I don't eat pork at all. I don't eat red meat either
[11693.44s -> 11701.74s]  What does that go? All right, it has to go above sugar. No red meat fell off the fucking cliff. Okay red meats
[11701.82s -> 11703.82s]  I don't eat it any I don't I don't eat it at all
[11706.96s -> 11710.64s]  Like literally i'm gonna throw like fucking throw lines like it fell off the goddamn mountain
[11722.28s -> 11726.20s]  Yeah, like sugar threw red meat and it buried it in the ocean
[11726.68s -> 11734.43s]  Okay, no, I don't eat nobody better. I don't eat any red meat anymore at all. What about steak?
[11734.59s -> 11736.75s]  It's not anymore that was just for a stream gag
[11738.46s -> 11741.74s]  Not anymore. Wait, this is my we're gonna do my other pyramid after this. I promise
[11743.69s -> 11745.69s]  I will show you what I used to eat like
[11746.17s -> 11751.45s]  Up until about like a year ago the mayonnaise. I'm not the the I always have mayonnaise on the brain
[11751.45s -> 11753.93s]  The red meat thing was just a gag for the stream. I don't eat red meat
[11754.83s -> 11760.35s]  Although I I I shouted that out all the time. I said how much I loved it. I did but not anymore
[11763.08s -> 11772.88s]  Okay, let's put eggs in here eggs
[11773.36s -> 11780.67s]  That makes sense to me
[11780.67s -> 11784.04s]  If I want I really do wonder if this belongs here
[11786.49s -> 11788.89s]  I don't know if this belongs. I think it belongs above mayonnaise
[11789.69s -> 11792.70s]  I don't eat eggs at every meal. I eat mayonnaise at every meal
[11793.50s -> 11795.26s]  besides at breakfast
[11795.26s -> 11801.58s]  That's is that true though?
[11801.58s -> 11806.54s]  All right. What about um
[11806.54s -> 11811.12s]  Mayo is eggs. What about the legs?
[11814.46s -> 11816.46s]  Eggs are dairy. Um
[11819.36s -> 11821.69s]  Uh, no, they're not
[11821.69s -> 11824.73s]  Like they are not dairy eggs are not dairy. I know that
[11825.29s -> 11836.54s]  No, what about easy baked oven meals? They are eggs are not dairy. They come from a chicken's ass. What are you talking about?
[11837.18s -> 11842.73s]  Is a chicken a cow cows don't lay eggs
[11843.60s -> 11851.64s]  They do live birth. Yeah, it's not from a cow. It's not dairy means from a dairy means
[11852.18s -> 11869.37s]  Milk-based prove it. Okay, you would like to go for on a tour at a farm. I'm going to ask the farmer
[11870.54s -> 11874.94s]  Hey, are eggs dairy? No, they're not
[11876.32s -> 11880.32s]  I thought you learned that in the third grade when you went with your class
[11881.61s -> 11887.31s]  To the look at how old everything is exhibit on the field trip when you were like eight
[11888.56s -> 11899.23s]  And they were all the actors and they all pretended to be from like the pilgrim times. You don't remember that apparently
[11905.39s -> 11912.59s]  What goes here though? What else do I eat? I definitely eat eggs more than no. I don't I think I do
[11913.31s -> 11919.48s]  I eat rice eggs and uh, what else what about beans? There you go. Bingo. Yep. That's right
[11922.91s -> 11926.11s]  Why does this keep happening? I swear to god this thing has a mind of its own
[11927.04s -> 11928.36s]  beans
[11928.36s -> 11935.66s]  All right. There you go. There is my food pyramid. That is currently how I live my life at the moment
[11936.38s -> 11943.32s]  Mayonnaise may be below fruit. I may have overdone it a little onions and garlic are in there too, by the way
[11943.80s -> 11956.22s]  This is mayonnaise plus this mayonnaise onions and garlic. What about what about drinks? Okay. I'll make another drink pyramid
[11971.24s -> 11977.52s]  Here's here is it. Here it is. Here is my drink pyramid
[11977.84s -> 11991.58s]  Is it only two things that I consume as of I literally have been trying to switch to tea
[11992.67s -> 12002.72s]  I don't that's it. What about wine? I haven't guys I haven't drank
[12004.17s -> 12007.63s]  in a very long time
[12007.79s -> 12015.23s]  Wine would be on here, but I haven't I have not drank alcohol in quite a while. It's been months
[12015.63s -> 12021.90s]  What about tea? Yeah water and coffee, you know, and I you have to if I drink one coffee I do
[12021.98s -> 12026.94s]  I it's a diuretic. I gotta be careful. I'm trying to go to uh, black tea and green tea now
[12027.50s -> 12031.72s]  There you go. There there it is. I made it
[12032.70s -> 12035.18s]  Now tell me what's wrong with this besides the mayonnaise plus
[12038.32s -> 12042.24s]  I don't need any red meat. I don't need any sugar milk and dairy. I don't eat very off
[12042.32s -> 12044.48s]  No bread really that no no fruits a little bit
[12045.04s -> 12051.76s]  Rice eggs and beans sometimes mayonnaise plus onions and garlic all the time greens radishes all the time nuts and seeds
[12052.16s -> 12059.24s]  Almonds peanut butter peanuts walnuts cashews. Eh, not really throw those in the trash
[12059.56s -> 12065.16s]  Don't throw those in the trash. If you don't want them donate them. Don't be an idiot fish. We're talking tuna
[12065.64s -> 12068.97s]  Salmon, we're talking
[12068.97s -> 12077.04s]  Sushi. Yep. I love it turkey poultry chicken. We're talking chicken fingers
[12077.12s -> 12079.12s]  We're talking turkey bird patties
[12079.52s -> 12083.36s]  Turkey ground turkey on top of look at this check at this
[12083.52s -> 12087.12s]  I'll show you some fucking combos you can do with this pyramid. You got your turkey patty
[12087.90s -> 12091.42s]  Combo that on top of the rice. That's brown rice
[12091.90s -> 12096.59s]  Turkey just fucking sprinkle a little bit of spinach on there. There you go
[12097.23s -> 12106.59s]  Done there's a full meal. You're ready. I don't need any of this shit. I'm kidding. That's gross
[12108.11s -> 12113.08s]  What's gross about having like a like a little some like a turkey like some like a nice pan
[12113.40s -> 12119.56s]  Seared turkey patty on top of a thing of brown rice with some kale on top with some chopped mayonnaise plus on it
[12119.80s -> 12131.63s]  We're talking garlic. What's wrong with that? You put your mayo in your drinks. No, I don't put mayo in it
[12131.71s -> 12139.37s]  Why would I do that? There's another one for you. You got a nice you toast up some you got some nice toasted almonds
[12139.69s -> 12148.22s]  You have a nice nice piece of salmon. Okay, chop up those almonds throw that away. That's not a real recipe
[12148.30s -> 12151.82s]  I'm just trying to make up stuff. All right, so you take the radishes. No, how do you do this?
[12152.22s -> 12160.01s]  How do I eat fish? All right, take hold on. I need to add something
[12160.33s -> 12168.67s]  I have to add something mayonnaise plus includes olive oil. I love olive oil. I eat it every single day mayonnaise plus includes olive oil
[12173.64s -> 12180.32s]  Olive oil around here salmon put it in the pan salt pepper. Don't touch don't do anything else to it
[12180.32s -> 12184.80s]  Please for the love god a little bit of olive oil. I'll just a little bit of salt pepper
[12184.80s -> 12189.10s]  Don't touch it put it skin side down in the pan into the oven 450 degrees
[12189.18s -> 12193.56s]  It's 12 minutes take it out. Don't fucking touch it. Let it sit there for a second
[12193.56s -> 12200.78s]  It's gonna be the best piece of salmon you've ever had in your whole life greens take some mayonnaise plus which is take a little bit
[12200.78s -> 12206.19s]  Of olive oil garlic only don't put an onions in there olive oil and garlic in a pan
[12206.51s -> 12213.45s]  Okay, cook it down really toast to roast up that garlic in that pan take your greens
[12213.53s -> 12218.48s]  Grab some kale throw the greens in there when it's hot shake it around 10 seconds
[12218.72s -> 12223.53s]  Get that thing out of there lay it next to the salmon after it comes out bingo
[12223.61s -> 12233.90s]  You've got yourself a salmon and kale garlic dinner burn the garlic. That's not what you've done in burn the garlic
[12233.98s -> 12241.60s]  I got it nice and roasted. Yeah sunflower seeds
[12241.60s -> 12248.16s]  Take a take take a half take a quarter pound of turkey dump sunflower seeds on it roasted toasted put it in the oven
[12248.94s -> 12255.60s]  125 degrees for 10 minutes dump mayonnaise on top of when it comes out eat a bowl of rice while you wait
[12256.16s -> 12260.62s]  Didn't know about that little fucking secret snack. Did you once that's done pull it out of the oven?
[12261.66s -> 12270.96s]  Uh squeeze lemon juice in your eyes and throw flour in your face and eat this as fast as you can
[12271.20s -> 12289.20s]  I've got a perfect pyramid doing clown makeup. Well, this is like a clown pyramid. Look, okay, that's this is it
[12289.36s -> 12292.16s]  It really is it I don't eat red meat. I don't eat that much sugar anymore
[12292.16s -> 12294.65s]  I don't take in that much milk or dairy
[12294.65s -> 12295.93s]  I don't mean I okay
[12295.93s -> 12301.21s]  Let's do you want to say what it used to be years ago before like by years ago
[12301.21s -> 12304.09s]  I mean like four years ago not that long ago. Let's do what it used to be
[12304.33s -> 12312.57s]  This is what it is now ready for this doesn't go back that far
[12314.41s -> 12316.41s]  Okay. Well, whatever i'm just gonna erase it
[12320.84s -> 12322.84s]  How would you erase yellow that it makes no sense?
[12325.23s -> 12327.31s]  Why perfect? He says you already took a screenshot
[12327.95s -> 12330.25s]  Just do the triangle tool
[12330.25s -> 12332.65s]  If I hold I don't want to I like this. I like the setup already
[12333.21s -> 12340.35s]  I thought I was gonna do new whatever how do I do like? Oh, what's the what's the command keyboard to do a new product?
[12340.99s -> 12350.27s]  Control what I need to know this for later control n control w file new
[12350.35s -> 12355.87s]  I know I know what it is, but I want to get like the real one. It's not control w. It's control n
[12357.77s -> 12363.48s]  No, I don't want to save
[12363.48s -> 12365.79s]  Okay, this is what it used to be
[12369.92s -> 12371.92s]  Uh, I am going to show you
[12372.16s -> 12376.44s]  Why you really need to take a look at your diet. It's really important shit. It really is
[12377.90s -> 12382.54s]  This is i'm not gonna pretend i'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie to you guys. This is gonna be for real
[12383.10s -> 12388.41s]  No fucking around this is you're gonna see right through me, okay
[12390.59s -> 12394.83s]  I'm going to go with this is probably like about like maybe like a year or two ago
[12395.31s -> 12406.89s]  This is a shitty triangle. What's wrong with it? This is it's fine. What?
[12408.25s -> 12410.20s]  That's fine
[12410.20s -> 12412.44s]  Okay, so down here. This is what I ate the most of
[12413.79s -> 12416.57s]  And it's embarrassing
[12416.57s -> 12419.05s]  It is it it actually is it's more than that
[12423.16s -> 12427.56s]  This is what my what do you think my number one source of food was for a long time?
[12434.09s -> 12436.65s]  Chicken, yep, what but very specific
[12437.37s -> 12445.24s]  No, not I know. No, no, no
[12445.48s -> 12447.40s]  fried chicken
[12447.40s -> 12455.24s]  Whether that's chicken sandwich whether that's chicken strips whether that's just chicken that's been fried it like just fried up chicken
[12458.44s -> 12462.94s]  I'm not kidding. Maybe this is not a year ago. Maybe this is probably like a probably like three or four years ago
[12462.94s -> 12464.78s]  But it used to be like this
[12464.78s -> 12473.79s]  This is not a joke
[12473.79s -> 12479.63s]  Spaghetti that's pasta, which is don't worry that you it's going it's coming right next to that
[12480.11s -> 12483.93s]  All right. Well fried chicken is gonna be yeah, that makes sense
[12484.57s -> 12488.54s]  Gotta be bigger than that too. Let's do like I don't know a hundred
[12492.22s -> 12503.40s]  And it's gone. Okay, cool. Wait, what is he? What are you doing? Where's my cursor?
[12503.96s -> 12511.37s]  Whatever. That's fine fried chicken
[12511.93s -> 12520.91s]  Fuck mom. Don't watch she's gonna be like what I raised him on a mayonnaise diet. Why is he doing this?
[12530.72s -> 12536.89s]  Uh, and i'm gonna clarify underneath because people are gonna be like what the fuck is he talking about i'm gonna clarify
[12537.85s -> 12541.08s]  this is like
[12541.08s -> 12543.74s]  Sandwiches, why just write it. It's so much faster
[12550.63s -> 12552.43s]  sandwiches
[12552.43s -> 12553.79s]  strips
[12553.79s -> 12556.22s]  this is uh
[12556.28s -> 12560.57s]  Nuggets, this is uh
[12562.68s -> 12565.21s]  Yeah
[12565.21s -> 12569.93s]  Yeah
[12569.93s -> 12573.37s]  That's chicken sandwiches chicken strips chicken nuggets
[12574.25s -> 12576.97s]  Oh man, I want it right now, but no
[12577.69s -> 12579.69s]  Not part of my current pyramid
[12579.77s -> 12583.24s]  Can't be included coming up next. We have what do you think?
[12589.18s -> 12605.45s]  This is bread and pasta. This is bread pasta flour
[12608.16s -> 12609.90s]  Okay
[12609.90s -> 12612.43s]  bread pasta flour
[12612.43s -> 12616.67s]  Because the flour and the bread on the chicken makes fried chicken
[12618.59s -> 12620.59s]  And i've had a lot of it all the time
[12621.87s -> 12627.23s]  No, no flour like flour tortillas flour like white flour wheat flour like i'm talking like it's in everything
[12627.55s -> 12636.44s]  I used to eat a ton of it and this sucks looking at this. Okay now after this
[12639.82s -> 12643.24s]  okay, um
[12643.24s -> 12645.24s]  After that, it's probably
[12645.80s -> 12648.62s]  Probably like ground beef
[12648.62s -> 12651.68s]  like meat
[12651.68s -> 12664.64s]  Yeah, it's like specifically ground beef just just like red meat. It's not good
[12665.36s -> 12670.30s]  It's too much. Look at it. Look at how just how sad this looks too
[12670.86s -> 12676.60s]  What's all the color?
[12676.60s -> 12678.60s]  This diet isn't bad though
[12679.88s -> 12682.60s]  Okay, I really need you to think if
[12683.22s -> 12684.52s]  consuming
[12684.52s -> 12686.36s]  fried chicken
[12686.36s -> 12688.60s]  As a majority of your diet is a good idea
[12688.92s -> 12697.77s]  You have to think about that
[12697.77s -> 12702.89s]  If here's the worst part about this if you put a plate of perfect fried chicken in front of me right now
[12703.29s -> 12707.32s]  I would break everything and just eat it because I would be like, I don't care. I love this so much
[12707.32s -> 12709.40s]  I don't even give a shit. I don't care. Give it to me
[12709.96s -> 12715.53s]  Okay above that
[12715.53s -> 12717.53s]  We're gonna do okay. So
[12719.26s -> 12719.98s]  uh
[12719.98s -> 12722.22s]  Probably onions like specifically onions
[12724.19s -> 12727.39s]  I would do a vegetable one, but I can't even do a green one
[12727.47s -> 12749.71s]  So we're gonna have to do like a puke one because it was onions only. Okay onions
[12756.73s -> 12759.10s]  No, I want to pick it up
[12759.10s -> 12762.62s]  Whatever
[12762.62s -> 12765.37s]  What are steakums?
[12765.45s -> 12767.45s]  They fit in here right there
[12771.18s -> 12773.74s]  Lavender is not a puke color. Well, I already used the puke color. Didn't I?
[12774.30s -> 12779.24s]  Oh, no, I didn't but that looks good onions are like this. Yeah, that's a good onions color
[12781.85s -> 12783.85s]  All right, and then after that
[12786.89s -> 12794.40s]  Hmm. Yeah, I know it's like a gray but the background is gray. What do you what do you want me to do?
[12794.48s -> 12803.74s]  Look, i'm ruining everything
[12803.74s -> 12805.74s]  I i've got to use white for milk
[12805.82s -> 12819.18s]  Because that's right here. How big is it though?
[12820.89s -> 12824.12s]  Yeah, it's pretty big
[12824.12s -> 12826.12s]  Weird, you know, what's really funny about this diet
[12826.76s -> 12832.12s]  That we'll talk about in a minute and this is just the total just liar hypocrisy dog shit
[12832.44s -> 12838.59s]  That a lot of us have a problem with and i'm like i'm guilty of it too. I'll tell you in a second
[12841.05s -> 12842.57s]  so up here
[12842.57s -> 12844.81s]  Is i'm gonna put it in the same spot
[12846.03s -> 12847.29s]  Right there
[12847.29s -> 12849.23s]  Here it is
[12849.23s -> 12851.23s]  This is sugar sweets and candy
[12852.24s -> 12857.20s]  And I remember telling everybody and telling friends and family like oh do you want like to get dessert? No, no
[12857.28s -> 12862.99s]  No, of course not. I mean sugar kills you sugar's so like bad for you. You're taking in sugar
[12864.73s -> 12872.75s]  No, not me. You see not me not this guy not me and little do I know on my own that I was eating like
[12873.23s -> 12881.26s]  Pasta and like red meat and sauce and onions and fried chicken sandwiches three four times a week
[12885.58s -> 12887.58s]  No, no, I don't drink soda
[12888.22s -> 12890.22s]  Hey, german, would you like a soda?
[12890.70s -> 12891.66s]  Okay
[12891.66s -> 12893.48s]  Would I like a

[12896.60s -> 12898.56s]  Okay, are you disgusting?
[12898.56s -> 12903.04s]  You know that like that's like that you that like rots your teeth and stuff and it's like we're it's like smoking a cigarette every
[12903.04s -> 12908.16s]  Time you drink a soda. Okay, this guy wants a soda. No, i'll take a lemon with i'll take a water with lemon, please
[12909.31s -> 12913.79s]  Fucking idiot. Uh, what's your entree gonna be?
[12914.70s -> 12923.13s]  I'll have flour bread pasta and meat fried inside of the thing that has a bunch of fucking oil in it. Okay
[12923.85s -> 12933.88s]  Yum, are you disgusting? Yes. Look
[12934.52s -> 12942.56s]  That's all you need to see. All right. So this is milk dairy. Actually, you know what eggs probably no, this is dairy
[12946.76s -> 12948.76s]  There's your dairy. I got it
[12949.64s -> 12962.28s]  Okay. Yeah, I definitely eat more I ate more onions than dairy. Wait, I didn't put sugar up here. Did I write it?
[12962.52s -> 12979.85s]  You can't even see that but whatever it doesn't matter sugar you're making us sad
[12980.41s -> 12982.17s]  Why is this all your diets?
[12982.17s -> 12985.63s]  Is this what you guys used to eat?
[12986.11s -> 12988.01s]  Did you eat this now?
[12988.01s -> 12993.53s]  You were just like me. You're just like me until I found until I got on team turkey
[12994.51s -> 12999.37s]  and team nuts
[12999.37s -> 13000.99s]  Join me
[13000.99s -> 13005.15s]  Join the turkey eaters the nut eaters the peanut butter eaters
[13005.63s -> 13015.95s]  The the the tuna fish eaters the salmon eaters join us. Don't eat this stuff that often
[13016.03s -> 13020.59s]  It's not good for you. It's not as bad. All right after dairy we got
[13022.27s -> 13025.39s]  I did eat vegetables. I wasn't like a total fucking psycho
[13026.91s -> 13032.86s]  I did but I ate a lot of yogurt and I thought that was really healthy of me
[13033.50s -> 13036.20s]  I would eat one
[13036.20s -> 13046.54s]  Just unsweetened greek yogurt and thought I was a god for the rest of the day turkey shrinks your dick
[13047.02s -> 13058.59s]  Well, that would be weird. It does not oh my god
[13060.80s -> 13062.80s]  Turkey doesn't shrink your dick
[13064.51s -> 13070.27s]  That's absurd. That's insane. And I refuse to even acknowledge that that's a real opinion
[13070.43s -> 13072.43s]  So we're gonna move on we prove it. Look it up
[13074.20s -> 13078.52s]  Um, I don't want the last thing in my search history to be does turkey shrink your dick
[13078.84s -> 13084.73s]  I'm feeling i'll forget about that one and someone will use this computer and be like, okay
[13085.05s -> 13091.29s]  Something's going on with this dude. I did eat vegetables. I really did
[13093.26s -> 13097.76s]  I still was a big fan of green vegetables, even though this is like the end of the pyramid
[13098.94s -> 13107.80s]  No, you know, i'm gonna at least do myself a favor i'm gonna put this this belongs onions get that
[13107.80s -> 13116.75s]  I mean who eats just onions. I mean I did eat a lot of them, but still holy shit
[13116.75s -> 13118.75s]  It actually shrinks your dick
[13119.53s -> 13122.40s]  Shut the fuck up
[13122.40s -> 13124.72s]  I refuse i'm not gonna believe it
[13126.99s -> 13129.63s]  Turkey does not shrink your dick. I'm not even gonna look it up
[13134.86s -> 13137.36s]  The final thing would be like condiments
[13137.98s -> 13143.68s]  So we'll do this
[13143.68s -> 13145.36s]  Just look at this diet
[13145.36s -> 13147.36s]  You want to know the sad part about this diet?
[13147.84s -> 13154.24s]  So, okay screenshot screenshot this in a second because this is actually really bad
[13154.80s -> 13176.40s]  This is like oil oil and condiments. That's pretty much my diet what it was so essentially this
[13178.20s -> 13186.17s]  Leveled up and knocked out all these other ones and got down to here green vegetables like green greens greens greens greens greens
[13187.40s -> 13201.40s]  And like condiments this dude's a keto streamer. This dude's got a turkey dick
[13208.88s -> 13217.39s]  Okay, this is I don't think I can even say this but when you say that I imagine like
[13218.43s -> 13220.80s]  Okay
[13220.80s -> 13222.80s]  You know the turkey's neck
[13222.88s -> 13227.63s]  That's all i'm gonna that's all i'm not gonna say any more words
[13228.35s -> 13233.60s]  I didn't say any more words. I said do you guys know a turkey's neck?
[13234.32s -> 13239.68s]  It's like oh, I know what the turkey's neck is. Yes. I'm done talking. I'm not why do I need to continue to speak?
[13244.36s -> 13246.28s]  No neck
[13246.28s -> 13249.56s]  N e c k do you guys know a turkey's neck?
[13250.28s -> 13258.19s]  What about baby food? Yeah, but that was just like a little snack that goes like up here
[13261.13s -> 13265.61s]  Gizzard dick
[13265.61s -> 13267.61s]  All right. Yeah, that's right. That's me
[13268.09s -> 13276.09s]  Why did you say that? What do you mean? Why did I say that? Why did you type that?
[13276.09s -> 13279.69s]  Why did a thousand of you why did a thousand of you type that?
[13280.57s -> 13283.77s]  Is it bad that I said it or is it bad that over a thousand of you wrote it first?
[13288.73s -> 13299.15s]  All right. There you go. There's my food pyramids. I hope you enjoyed it, but here's the sad thing
[13299.63s -> 13306.64s]  I'm going to show you something because this is actually bad and it's I was thinking this as I was making this pyramid
[13307.04s -> 13313.45s]  Let's look at the actual food pyramid the one that everyone thought was the good one for like five decades
[13317.16s -> 13328.30s]  It is not that different to the one I just showed you food pyramid. Here it is. Okay healthy food pyramid
[13328.62s -> 13342.67s]  It's it's all bread
[13342.67s -> 13348.88s]  Okay, it's a bunch of bread and and vegetables and fruits and then milk. Let's see how different mine
[13348.96s -> 13350.96s]  This is so coolly made too. Look at this
[13351.68s -> 13353.76s]  Log in to see more. Oh my god
[13354.40s -> 13356.40s]  Don't give me that fucking bullshit
[13357.80s -> 13360.11s]  I can't even get away from this website
[13360.11s -> 13366.80s]  This is linked me to pinterest and i'm trapped on pinterest and begging me to make an account. Okay. Here we go
[13372.33s -> 13374.72s]  save image as
[13374.72s -> 13376.88s]  Here's the this is the original usda
[13377.68s -> 13391.24s]  image
[13391.24s -> 13393.79s]  usda
[13393.79s -> 13396.09s]  Okay, let's go over this real quick
[13399.36s -> 13400.96s]  This is what?
[13400.96s -> 13402.96s]  Your this is what you were supposed to eat
[13403.84s -> 13406.01s]  So you got bread
[13406.01s -> 13410.49s]  Bread cereal rice pasta should be at this was 40 percent of your entire diet
[13413.96s -> 13415.96s]  It was that was my diet
[13417.96s -> 13420.68s]  I didn't although I did vegetables were not up here and neither with fruits
[13421.24s -> 13424.80s]  This came down here
[13424.80s -> 13429.36s]  Milk yogurt cheese meat poultry. It was a bunch of bread and corn
[13429.92s -> 13439.18s]  This makes me want to puke. Is there no there's no turkey inside here, but I mean they do have peanut butter
[13439.50s -> 13441.02s]  I will give them that
[13441.02s -> 13446.70s]  Although this belongs here mayo is at the top
[13464.33s -> 13468.65s]  Mayo is apparently worse than cookies candy and chips
[13469.61s -> 13472.01s]  It's the worst thing in history of eating
[13472.97s -> 13474.97s]  You're not supposed to eat it
[13475.74s -> 13478.30s]  You're supposed to have mayo less than you have cookies
[13479.20s -> 13485.98s]  Now imagine if I ate like 30 cookies a day worse than sugar. That's not even accurate
[13487.56s -> 13489.72s]  Oil is good for you. This is old shit
[13489.72s -> 13493.96s]  This is back when they this is back when the cavemen were trading teeth with each other. All right
[13493.96s -> 13500.30s]  This is not even a real good list. This is the you want bread. You want to eat loads of bread every day
[13502.99s -> 13505.31s]  You want all of your food to come from bread?
[13508.22s -> 13514.38s]  Oh, yeah, this is pretty good diet 40% of donuts bread pasta and cereal and some tacos
[13516.97s -> 13519.61s]  They didn't know shit about mayonnaise. They didn't understand. They didn't know anything
[13520.49s -> 13523.53s]  They didn't know that had this fucking polyunsaturated fat in it
[13524.67s -> 13531.88s]  Yeah, that's a big word. I know it they didn't know anything about peanut butter
[13531.88s -> 13536.68s]  They're having all like the good fats fat was bad back in the day guys back then fat was bad
[13536.76s -> 13539.71s]  All fat was bad, but new science
[13540.35s -> 13549.79s]  Has put mayonnaise way back way down to here because it's a healthy fat. There's been so much more science on fat
[13549.95s -> 13553.73s]  That's why peanut butter everybody loves it. It's so good for you olive oil mayonnaise
[13555.18s -> 13557.42s]  Mayonnaise good real mayonnaise is healthy
[13558.50s -> 13568.43s]  Marshmallows marshmallow fluff is like zero. It's like 12 calories. They didn't know this shit back in the day
[13568.83s -> 13579.63s]  No, it's not it's not hold on is mayonnaise good for you real mayonnaise
[13582.60s -> 13585.98s]  Here we go, this is from very well fit
[13586.54s -> 13591.82s]  Dot com you think there's a website that doesn't tell you the what is good and fit for your fucking body
[13592.06s -> 13599.39s]  You don't think it's that website get out of here depending on the type of diet you follow mayo can be considered good
[13599.95s -> 13603.69s]  Or bad for you. Okay. Well, let me I gotta read the whole article
[13603.69s -> 13607.45s]  I'm actually gonna read the fucking reddit thread and make my opinion on it the reddit like height like the title
[13607.69s -> 13612.54s]  It's mainly hey
[13612.54s -> 13617.66s]  Americans seem to have a love-hate relationship with mayonnaise. It is the best-selling condiment in north america
[13617.82s -> 13618.92s]  Thank you
[13618.92s -> 13625.82s]  And it is a lot popular and it is in a lot of popular american foods from sandwiches. Thank you tuna salad
[13625.90s -> 13631.18s]  Love it deviled eggs egg salad. Oh tartar sauce. Love it part of my fish diet
[13632.70s -> 13635.52s]  But mayonnaise has seemed to have acquired a bad reputation
[13636.08s -> 13640.66s]  Hmm, maybe it's for much fucking internet dickheads that talk about how mayonnaise is fat instead
[13640.74s -> 13649.52s]  Oh, and I don't like it because it's like white and gross a high fat food mayonnaise is often thought to be unhealthy
[13650.50s -> 13653.14s]  It is mostly fat and as a result, it's calorie dense
[13653.22s -> 13655.94s]  In case you know, you gotta get put some weight on if you want
[13656.43s -> 13660.91s]  It's easy for calories and fat to quickly add up when you're not paying attention to portion sizes
[13661.15s -> 13666.61s]  Maybe you just shouldn't eat the whole can in addition
[13666.61s -> 13672.61s]  Some people steer clear of the popular condiment due to concerns that improperly stored mayonnaise would be hotbed for bacteria store it correctly
[13672.77s -> 13681.60s]  Thank you very well fit.com the safety of potato salad left outdoors during a fourth of july barbecue or a tuna salad sandwich from a food truck
[13682.18s -> 13692.90s]  May be questionable what that real is that actually a real thing?
[13694.48s -> 13698.64s]  The truth is with careful selection proper preparation and storage and moderate use
[13699.04s -> 13703.36s]  Mayonnaise can be a delicious and healthy addition to a low carb diet. Thank you
[13703.68s -> 13708.27s]  Let's see. Okay. Now let's get to let's get to the real meat here
[13708.43s -> 13715.36s]  Depending on the type of diet you follow mayo can be considered good or bad for you. Mayonnaise is mostly oil
[13715.76s -> 13719.92s]  So it is a high fat and calorie dense condiment with 100 calories per tablespoon
[13720.00s -> 13721.44s]  That's a lot
[13721.44s -> 13723.36s]  If you're on a low fat or low calorie diet
[13723.36s -> 13729.97s]  You want to exercise portion control and measure out the amount of mayo you use for people on a low carb or ketogenic diet mayonnaise
[13729.97s -> 13738.02s]  Can be endured more liberally while mayo is made almost entirely of fat. It mostly is unsaturated fat, which is a healthier fat
[13738.18s -> 13741.17s]  Okay
[13741.17s -> 13746.56s]  This is how this is how I determine how much mayonnaise i'm using so when I make tuna salad
[13746.72s -> 13752.19s]  It's one of my favorite things since even since I was a toddler since I was like seven years old
[13752.43s -> 13756.16s]  You take a nice good can of tuna fish a good one
[13756.70s -> 13765.57s]  Sustainable get a sustainable good sustainable tuna brand open it up. No, what do you mean?
[13765.65s -> 13769.44s]  No, put it in a bowl
[13770.30s -> 13777.86s]  Mush it up with your fork stir it around and then put a bunch of mayonnaise in there until it becomes a paste
[13778.88s -> 13789.07s]  Is that too much? I don't know. Is it too little? I don't know, but it becomes a like tuna paste
[13790.27s -> 13798.46s]  It's not thin. It's not like too much mayonnaise. It's just like enough to keep it all together. It was one time
[13799.26s -> 13804.46s]  Where okay, this is incoming disgusting statement. Hope you all know what we're talking about
[13804.46s -> 13806.86s]  Like how gross this pyramid is that we're looking at? All right. Anyways
[13807.89s -> 13809.89s]  One time I was really hungry
[13810.45s -> 13813.65s]  And I did a big thing of tuna right just right out of the can put it in there
[13813.65s -> 13818.58s]  Okay, i'm ready for the mayonnaise and I just I my my eyes went I saw red
[13819.54s -> 13823.89s]  I don't know why and I took a big tablespoon of the mayonnaise and I was like, all right, there's one
[13824.13s -> 13826.21s]  I'm gonna do another one. That's not enough
[13826.21s -> 13832.37s]  I did another full fucking huge tablespoon of mayonnaise and I started to stir it up and I went boom boom boom boom
[13832.45s -> 13838.62s]  Okay, and it's looking a little that looks fine. Not enough and I did a third gigantic disgusting
[13838.94s -> 13845.36s]  Slop of mayonnaise into it and there was probably more mayonnaise than tuna in this and I immediately regretted my mistake
[13847.28s -> 13851.55s]  I took a bite of it just just to check because I didn't want to waste it or anything and it was
[13852.03s -> 13863.95s]  It was I was and I ate it. I ate the whole thing. I ate the whole thing. He still ate it
[13864.19s -> 13869.02s]  That's not moderate no, but that that's all right though because listen why the oil matters is important
[13869.18s -> 13873.42s]  The good news is that almost all any edible oil can be used to make mayonnaise
[13873.90s -> 13876.62s]  But get all that other shit out of here. I want it with good
[13877.24s -> 13882.11s]  100 straight from italy olive oil. That's how I make mine
[13882.27s -> 13887.97s]  You can make your own mayonnaise cheaper the oil itself is the biggest factor in the healthfulness of the recipe
[13890.64s -> 13899.70s]  In the united states most commercial mayonnaise is made with soy oil. Yuck. That's problematic due to its high levels of omega-6
[13899.78s -> 13902.26s]  Get that out of here. No, you want the reels the good stuff
[13902.50s -> 13905.87s]  The best selling commercial mayonnaise in the u.s
[13905.87s -> 13909.98s]  Is helman's brand in the east and best foods in the west
[13910.38s -> 13913.66s]  Those companies sell mayo made from soy oil in the u.s
[13914.14s -> 13918.96s]  And canola oil in canada canola oil has a lower omega-6 content than soy oil
[13919.73s -> 13921.73s]  Nope, no, no, no
[13922.05s -> 13927.57s]  If you make the mayonnaise yourself, you can use any kind of oil including olive or avocado oil
[13929.79s -> 13935.74s]  Uh-huh. What did I just tell you you get a and plus this is I don't know how when this article is made
[13938.14s -> 13942.94s]  A lot of a lot of mayonnaise that you buy at like good stores at the grocery store have
[13943.50s -> 13946.54s]  olive oil
[13946.54s -> 13949.90s]  If I turn it in says soy oil, I turn it around immediately and I put it back
[13950.66s -> 13952.74s]  I put it immediately back on the shelf
[13952.90s -> 13957.12s]  But I don't need to do that anymore because I know exactly what I like in my brand
[13957.36s -> 13962.46s]  I either I either make it myself as i've never made mayonnaise of my own by myself ever
[13963.14s -> 13967.86s]  It's just a way to make the streamer make the audience think that he's way more talented and smarter than he is
[13968.26s -> 13970.74s]  When in reality it was all made up from the very beginning
[13972.75s -> 13986.62s]  I've never made my own mayonnaise ever. I buy a good brand. Anyways, you get it. It's olive oil olive oil and eggs
[13986.78s -> 13997.11s]  Listen, man, you aren't healthy little mayonnaise
[13998.72s -> 14002.43s]  Almond is the best
[14002.51s -> 14011.42s]  I don't I wish I could agree with you there. I cannot agree with you
[14011.42s -> 14018.94s]  I'm gonna have to go with 365 original organic mayonnaise. I'm sorry you lose you lost out on that one
[14019.18s -> 14027.98s]  It's smooth. It's fucking creamy. It's perfect. It's thick enough. You can get it right on a sandwich
[14028.30s -> 14046.06s]  Do a mayonnaise asmr you make me sick. Don't wait. There's one thing one thing one thing
[14047.16s -> 14055.30s]  365 is the good my favorite like store brand. It's not olive oil. It's canola oil. Okay, just so everybody's and freak out that like
[14055.30s -> 14059.78s]  He said he doesn't like what it's it's soy oil. I don't want olive oil and canola. That's fine
[14060.10s -> 14066.62s]  It's a bougie rich. You're a bougie rich bitch
[14067.71s -> 14070.19s]  All right time that guy over 10 seconds at least
[14078.62s -> 14079.58s]  Oh
[14079.58s -> 14081.58s]  Why because I buy like
[14082.12s -> 14085.18s]  365 wait, I did say 365 for something else too
[14085.82s -> 14087.82s]  Today
[14087.82s -> 14094.11s]  What was it?
[14094.11s -> 14101.92s]  Well, what is that? What did I say peanut butter? Oh shit. Oh now you guys know where I like to shop for my like peanut butter
[14102.96s -> 14104.99s]  oh
[14104.99s -> 14106.99s]  He likes the stuff at whole foods
[14116.18s -> 14122.22s]  Look, I okay. Listen, I like I go I just I don't just go to whole foods every fucking day
[14122.22s -> 14128.06s]  Okay, I buy my shelf stable stuff from whole foods because I like it better. I think it's a higher quality
[14128.14s -> 14130.30s]  It is the peanut butter mayonnaise
[14130.94s -> 14136.06s]  Uh, like tuna condiments. It's that's all better from whole foods. I'm sorry. It is. I'm just telling I'm just telling it is
[14136.06s -> 14139.82s]  It just is i'm sorry. That's it. That's true. That's real. That's for real
[14142.26s -> 14146.90s]  It's not just like a hundred rows of like hinds tomato ketchup
[14147.06s -> 14153.30s]  There's like a bunch of different ketchups that buy a bunch of different like local companies or brands or or a healthier it
[14158.46s -> 14161.57s]  He's a capitalist
[14161.57s -> 14164.37s]  I just don't want I don't want helmans and they have helmans
[14165.39s -> 14167.87s]  And okay, they have helmans and grocery store brand
[14168.82s -> 14171.06s]  And I don't I don't want to buy grocery store brand
[14173.86s -> 14179.90s]  I'll eat I want helmans instead of grocery store brand. Is he still on this? Holy it's been a long time
[14180.30s -> 14188.53s]  What about what about the somebody said it that mayonnaise is fucking incredible
[14190.99s -> 14192.99s]  What it was? Uh,
[14193.23s -> 14195.15s]  Cupid pie. Yep
[14195.23s -> 14200.80s]  Cupid mayonnaise is insane. It's it's a japanese mayonnaise. It's the best mayonnaise i've ever had in my life

[15522.53s -> 15527.49s]  DeVitt isn't here. I wonder if he'd want you to leave things unfinished here
[15528.90s -> 15532.42s]  Or is there something more important in New Orleans?
[15535.44s -> 15538.00s]  Maybe you should just get back to your wedding eggins

[18643.94s -> 18645.94s]  Tomorrow in pre-stream chat if you're there
[18647.06s -> 18649.46s]  Only about 30 to 40 minutes before stream I pop in
[18650.57s -> 18652.57s]  Sometimes a little more than that
[18654.76s -> 18656.76s]  Don't use disguise. How would you even do that?
[18657.16s -> 18659.16s]  Take a photo of the dead groom
[18659.48s -> 18662.33s]  Where did I get a camera?
[18662.33s -> 18665.05s]  Oh, you can bring him all the way out there
[18666.95s -> 18668.95s]  And lay him on the ground and take a picture
[18669.43s -> 18671.67s]  But you have to take him all the way to the beginning of the level
[18674.39s -> 18679.21s]  Uh, yeah, there'll be a poll tomorrow because I need to figure out what it's gonna be. It'll be probably three or four different games
[18679.77s -> 18682.63s]  I did that
[18682.63s -> 18688.68s]  Don't use the gatling gun kill everyone except for civilians. I didn't do that

[18762.92s -> 18764.60s]  It might even be 3do
[18764.60s -> 18767.32s]  I might finally bust that thing out and actually play the damn thing
[18767.96s -> 18770.46s]  I have like 10 games for it, too
[18775.22s -> 18779.46s]  I only bought the 3do for one reason because I wanted to play this game. I'll tell you exactly what it is
[18780.34s -> 18801.32s]  Give you the exact name
[18801.72s -> 18805.94s]  It's called twisted

[18807.72s -> 18812.71s]  It's an fmv game show game
[18814.10s -> 18821.10s]  And it looks just it looks you know how they all look could be terrible. That's the only reason why I bought it
[18831.58s -> 18833.58s]  Not symmetrical. I'm annoyed
[18833.98s -> 18838.89s]  I always killed one person accidentally somehow zero bodies discovered though
[18839.45s -> 18844.70s]  How did cape kill oh right right because she went absolutely nuts
[18845.90s -> 18856.86s]  God I was gonna say that doesn't make any sense. She can't kill people a maid was a civilian. Oh, that's right. Yeah
[18860.89s -> 18863.03s]  This game is pretty good
[18863.03s -> 18864.71s]  How many levels are in the game?
[18864.71s -> 18867.46s]  Was it like three chapters four chapters?

[18872.71s -> 18874.15s]  20 30
[18874.15s -> 18877.85s]  Oh, I can see why people like it
[18877.85s -> 18882.09s]  If you if you're good at video games and you like planning stuff, you can do a lot of that stuff very very quickly
[18882.63s -> 18892.65s]  Simultaneously, but yeah, we're not gonna play tomorrow. We're gonna do either radio game cube
[18893.69s -> 18895.93s]  Or something else i'll give you pull tomorrow
