[3.13s -> 13.03s]  Why are you upset with me? We're upset with you. Where? Why? Why? It's like 15 minutes.
[14.14s -> 26.17s]  Why are you upset? Oh, right. You guys changed. I see what you're doing. Oh, right. Because from
[26.17s -> 33.06s]  a day or two ago. Right. Now I remember. Finally. I'm here. I just want to be ready.
[38.66s -> 51.96s]  Be remembered. I did remember. I'm here. And here's what we're going to do. I didn't even...
[52.76s -> 56.60s]  Look, I'm glad that there's people that remind me of certain things. Certain releases and games
[56.60s -> 61.51s]  that I played about a year or so ago that come out later. Because I play something,
[62.15s -> 70.17s]  even if it's a demo, whatever. Right. And then I just forget it exists. So one such game was
[71.29s -> 80.02s]  such art. I played the demo or the free version of it. It was a lot of fun. I made some paintings.
[81.06s -> 109.94s]  And I've been told that it's now out. How long has it been out for? Four years. I'm excited.
[115.40s -> 129.85s]  Re-run Andy. Yeah, the queen died. Yeah. Crazy. I don't have really anything to say about it.
[130.66s -> 144.71s]  Other than, yeah, that's crazy. Almost 100. I hope I fucking live to 100. Is your mic better?
[149.34s -> 175.27s]  That's crazy, Omegalul. Look. Oh, that's crazy. You're going to be on Twitch for 50 years?
[177.08s -> 190.92s]  No, I'm not. I'm telling you right now. Yeah. What a take on that. Oh, man. That's crazy.
[190.92s -> 198.02s]  That's crazy. Anyways, so we got some stuff going on today. Yeah, that was not a good take.
[202.63s -> 207.91s]  I don't even know what to say about stuff like this though, right? I'm so bad with giving takes
[208.63s -> 232.68s]  on anything. That's why I never give them. He gives cold takes. Here's what I will say.
[234.86s -> 253.51s]  I took the queen. I'm going to sound probably dumb here. Is that the last queen? No.
[255.10s -> 264.86s]  Is this just going to keep going? I guess we have the prince and the princess, right? But is it
[264.86s -> 282.97s]  going to be the queen of England? NA education. There already is. Monarchy sequel. King for now.
[283.77s -> 289.00s]  I don't know. I genuinely don't really know how it works. I just didn't know.
[289.64s -> 296.95s]  But yeah, as a popular streamer on the internet has once said, that's crazy.
[302.65s -> 309.83s]  I'm quoting somebody else. But now, I mean, like I said, I would hope I get to live to be 100.
[310.39s -> 333.67s]  But we're going to play such art. That's crazy. I would love to be 100. Yeah. When are you going
[333.67s -> 339.43s]  to play Disney Infinity 3.0? You know, one of the things I was going to do, I was going to play that
[339.43s -> 346.38s]  new Disney game that came out today. What's it called? Like Disney magical village or something,
[346.38s -> 353.40s]  whatever it's called. Just to have everybody say, wait, I thought you would rather show your
[353.40s -> 359.45s]  asshole than play the Disney Infinity, but you're going to play the Disney kind of animal crossing
[359.45s -> 387.37s]  game. Show people the question marking. It's like two days ago. You would get it if you were there.
[388.09s -> 406.57s]  Look what you did. Look what you started. Is it bathroom mic? It's not a, this is all right.
[406.57s -> 434.60s]  That may be angry. Yeah. Let's let's let's start playing. You should play Splatoon three. I don't
[434.60s -> 441.40s]  I don't even know those Splatoon two. I can't play Splatoon. I can't do it. I've already talked about
[441.40s -> 455.59s]  I can't play Splatoon. It's skill issue. Yes, it is. I've been very vocal about how it is.
[455.59s -> 468.87s]  It's a skill issue. You are correct. What about art? I'm doing art right now. Well, in two seconds.
[471.30s -> 474.18s]  He's really bad at it. You've never seen me play Splatoon. You don't know that.
[479.67s -> 484.54s]  Yeah. The only thing I will say about the queen is then we'll move on. I hope to live a long,
[485.74s -> 494.89s]  fulfilling life. 96. That's very old. So that's, I mean, I know some people that live up into their
[494.89s -> 512.28s]  nineties, eighties as a long life. That's crazy. God damn it. This is why I don't talk about anything
[512.28s -> 517.72s]  on stream because I'm so bad at articulating a single fucking actual point about anything
[517.72s -> 525.58s]  that it always just kind of comes out as. Yeah, that's, that's crazy, man. I can't do it.
[525.58s -> 538.14s]  I'm so bad at articulating like serious points. God damn it. Now that's the all right. Let's go.
[538.14s -> 541.50s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. All right, we're done. We're done. We're
[541.50s -> 550.38s]  going. We're moving forward. I can't, I can never. This is why I can't talk about anything
[551.10s -> 555.62s]  because I was thinking about it before the stream. I'm like, oh yeah, that's right.
[556.26s -> 563.78s]  If the queen did die. Okay. Let me think of something meaningful to say. What could I say?
[563.78s -> 577.80s]  Okay. That's wild. Steam like coming out of my fucking shirt. Nice public statement, Andy.
[587.06s -> 595.80s]  You're a Looney Tunes character? No, dude. I'm just not good with serious topics. I never have been
[595.80s -> 619.40s]  ever. So let's go. How you doing? Dude, you're like the Joker. I'm not. No, stop. I'm not at all.
[619.40s -> 626.42s]  Please. Anybody that says they're the Joker is actually the Penguin. Anybody that says they're
[626.42s -> 630.02s]  the Penguin is actually the Riddler. And if you say you're the Riddler, you're actually the Joker.
[630.02s -> 635.66s]  We already went over this. We did this already. I don't want to, where are you? There you are.
[635.66s -> 639.26s]  You're far away today. I don't want to, I don't want to be the Penguin. I'm not the Penguin,
[639.26s -> 651.72s]  but actually I might be. New angle. Yeah. You're up there. This camera angle makes you look short.
[651.72s -> 656.58s]  I'm sitting in a, no, there's no routine. There's no bit coming. The people think it's a routine
[656.58s -> 662.01s]  coming. No, no, there's no routine. There's not gonna be a joke. There's no bit on the way. I'm
[662.01s -> 667.85s]  just sitting in the chair and I move the camera because I got sick of moving because, uh, so the
[667.85s -> 678.22s]  camera used to sit here on the monitor and the problem, he's in a high chair. I think it's a
[678.22s -> 685.21s]  good angle. This looks super set up for something. It's not. It's, I swear to God, it's just a new
[685.21s -> 689.37s]  angle. I just put you in it. No one's going to come out of the closet over there and like
[689.37s -> 693.29s]  strangle me with like a bag or something. I promise. I'm, it's just a new angle.
[694.33s -> 701.18s]  Cause when I, when I move my mouse, my keyboard's on the desk and it shakes the desk a little,
[701.18s -> 705.86s]  which shakes the camera that's on the monitor that's being shaken from me touching the desk.
[705.86s -> 718.33s]  And I don't like it. So now I can go like this and I don't shake you. Nice isometric Andy. It's a bad
[718.33s -> 725.30s]  angle. Fix it. It's staying like this for at least the whole day today. It's zoomed in all weird.
[725.30s -> 731.51s]  The background is massive behind you. What are you talking about? What is going on here? It's a
[731.51s -> 742.44s]  different camera angle. It's a different, it's just a different angle. That's a closet right there.
[742.44s -> 753.14s]  What? See, look, this is a closet. That's the closet. I'm just sitting down. We don't like change.
[753.14s -> 769.38s]  Yeah, I can see that. It's all zoomed in and weird. It's not. It's a CCTV angle. Well,
[769.38s -> 775.40s]  get used to it for the next like six hours because that's what we're doing today.
[775.40s -> 788.82s]  You look so small. The FOV looks odd. There's no FOV. What are you guys talking about?
[788.82s -> 792.74s]  Anyways, today, ladies and gentlemen, we've got some, hey, there you are. Ladies and gentlemen,
[792.74s -> 797.72s]  today we've got some fun stuff. I'm going to be playing such art as you see on the screen right
[797.72s -> 814.07s]  now. We're going to be playing multi versus later security camera. What the fuck? Why is it going so
[814.07s -> 837.38s]  high? Huh? Is this what it looks like? That's what all right. Well, whatever. Why can you see the
[837.38s -> 854.54s]  ceiling? Why can that go? Why is it going so high? I cropped it. I cropped it. Yeah. I didn't know
[854.54s -> 862.90s]  it was that much space above me. Well, you're getting to see, you get the CCTV angle today.
[862.90s -> 875.27s]  This is a bit, it's no, I swear to God, it's not. Keep the full view. You, you want me to do this.
[875.27s -> 893.05s]  Okay, guys, welcome to the stream. We're here. You can see my ceiling. Okay, so I got streamer
[893.05s -> 910.14s]  mode turned on, by the way. Somebody said Alice in Wonderland. I don't know what streamer mode does,
[910.14s -> 916.55s]  but I'm surely going to turn it off in probably five minutes. All right, so we're going to play
[916.55s -> 920.39s]  this. We're going to play multi versus later, by the way, in case you didn't know. Hey, hey,
[920.39s -> 930.38s]  hold on. I got that juggle. Hold on. Can you see this? Oh, can you see that? Can I do like
[930.38s -> 945.22s]  tricks like that? All right. Anyways, we're going to play, we're going to play multi versus later.
[945.22s -> 949.96s]  Gizmo just came out, which is awesome. I'm very excited. It's going to be a sponsored stream,
[949.96s -> 955.10s]  sponsored segment of the stream. This is, this part's not sponsored, but I mean, I'm going to play
[955.10s -> 960.31s]  it. And Gizmo, it's, Gremlins 2 is my favorite we've ever made. We literally just talked about
[960.31s -> 966.58s]  it on Hey, Donna, which if you haven't seen Hey, Donna, it's a great show. Go check it out. Will Neff.
[966.58s -> 972.50s]  Stretch the game to fit. It looks weird. No, I'm, this is funny for five seconds and then we,
[972.50s -> 979.42s]  I'm turning, I'm going back to what it was. But yeah, Gizmo from Gremlins is in multi versus,
[979.42s -> 986.26s]  as of right now. And I, I would be lying if I told you I wasn't very excited. And I was going
[986.26s -> 990.52s]  to play it. So that's really cool. Warner Brothers is going to obviously sponsor that segment of the
[990.52s -> 997.72s]  stream, which is just cool. I'm just, I'm happy to do that. I very much enjoy the game. So,
[998.44s -> 1003.78s]  all right, we're going to show this only once and that's it. And we're going to move on. Finally,
[1003.78s -> 1043.19s]  it's been like 15 minutes. Can you guys hear? My name's Jeremy Storymode. What's fast forward?
[1043.19s -> 1053.40s]  Try just to fast forward. Speeds at the pace at which you will gain fame and money. If you want
[1053.40s -> 1058.44s]  to say only play a couple hours for the purpose of a stream or a video, this might be for you.
[1058.44s -> 1069.21s]  What? Are you serious? They made a streamer version of the game. That's actually kind of
[1069.21s -> 1088.46s]  perfect. Let's try it. Let's do the streamer version. Oh, yeah. Cutscene. Okay. I've got
[1088.46s -> 1096.36s]  artistic talent. Just play my MS Paint. This is not even close to being the same thing. For decades,
[1096.36s -> 1101.08s]  art has been largely dominated by robots and other artificial, I can't, if a word has more
[1101.08s -> 1105.88s]  than four syllables, I can't say it anymore. What happened? Artificial. That's four syllables.
[1105.88s -> 1110.25s]  What actually happened to me? It's been in the last three streams. What happened? I'm fucking
[1110.25s -> 1119.08s]  serious. Artificial intelligence. By the way, this is already happening. Yeah, I've seen the
[1119.08s -> 1127.42s]  Kermit the Frog in Scarface. Realistic 2015, right? It's crazy. It's actually, it's crazy.
[1128.63s -> 1139.37s]  Wow, that's crazy. Again, here we are. Great. I'm really good at talking about anything.
[1139.37s -> 1145.99s]  Okay, the world of art has become stale and in need of renewal. It is time for you to act.
[1145.99s -> 1151.85s]  You've been assigned a studio on board the International Space City so you can fully express
[1151.85s -> 1158.52s]  your artistic self. As on Earth, the threat of a robotic revolt is rising. An alien species,
[1158.52s -> 1165.18s]  the Crabucks, covet the planet's saltwater. Only you can decide what to paint on your next canvas.
[1165.18s -> 1169.50s]  All right, so I remember this game. I did, I think it was pretty fun last time. I have a streamer
[1169.50s -> 1178.20s]  menu. I don't know what the streamer menu is, but we are going to do this. I'm going to turn this
[1178.20s -> 1197.10s]  down. Streamer menu. Is that working? Does that work? We're at 0.5%. I feel like that's not
[1197.10s -> 1204.89s]  changing to that level. Okay, that's fine. All right, so what, you can't see it? Streamer menu.
[1204.89s -> 1209.75s]  Well, I don't want to spoil anything because I know if I pull this up, that's my camera, you idiot.
[1210.82s -> 1214.10s]  If I pull this up and there's like a command you can write, I want to make sure it's not something
[1214.10s -> 1226.22s]  you can spam right away. Hold on. Challenge my skills, challenge my style, boo me, rate my
[1226.22s -> 1235.83s]  painting. Okay, this is fine. How does this work? Well, let me get in the video game first. Wait,
[1236.23s -> 1250.78s]  I can ask you to boo me? All right, well, let's go. How do you do this?
[1252.38s -> 1263.93s]  Ongoing poll, boo or applaud German985's performance. How does this work? Did you guys
[1263.93s -> 1297.40s]  see anything in chat? No? 14 viewers? How many people are real here? Only 14 of you figured that
[1297.48s -> 1309.69s]  out? Hold on a minute. Wait, there are 12,000 of you here. There are 12,000 and only 14 of you
[1309.69s -> 1322.46s]  figured it out. No way. Type boo or clap in the chat with an exclamation point. Holy shit,
[1322.46s -> 1328.73s]  that's insane. I can't, that's crazy. Yeah. Okay. End the challenge. Okay, that was fun.
[1328.73s -> 1337.10s]  Ooh, yeah. All right. Get it off my fucking screen. How do I get this off the screen? Okay.
[1337.10s -> 1342.66s]  All right, I got a new, I got a document. Apartment A64-3 International Space City
[1342.66s -> 1356.34s]  secure password 123. This one, right? Washing a toilet? All right. This was not in the other game.
[1356.34s -> 1367.05s]  Welcome to your studio. So this is the real thing. This is the real game. Okay. Check your email on
[1367.05s -> 1377.06s]  the main computer. Let's go. Welcome to your studio. I am ico62, your assistant and contact
[1377.06s -> 1382.58s]  with United Earth. Following the results of your last DNA test in light of your artistic potential,
[1382.58s -> 1386.89s]  you've been registered with the Talent Development Program, the United Earth Program.
[1386.89s -> 1399.46s]  All right. There are boxes everywhere. Is that normal? I have to sit up too, people. That's what
[1399.46s -> 1406.58s]  here. You have to type boo or clap with the exclamation point. Okay. Okay, cool. Some equipment
[1406.58s -> 1410.10s]  could not be installed before your arrival. Some of them essential to your work will soon be
[1410.10s -> 1416.47s]  assembled by our technicians. You have to pay the installation costs. All right. Fine. Who replies
[1416.47s -> 1422.82s]  with an email back? Okay. Just okay. No, you've got to write okay and then hit, no, first you
[1422.82s -> 1432.04s]  got to say, hey, uh, comma space, write a, write a whole thing that writes right. Okay. And then
[1432.04s -> 1441.62s]  hit enter, enter dash Jeremy space content creator space brackets, Twitch streamer, uh, and then
[1441.62s -> 1448.73s]  enter. And then like, uh, my way you can reach me and you know, what my email, that's how I do it.
[1453.30s -> 1469.88s]  F let me F there's no F you lied to me. Yeah. Content creator, comma artist, comma producer,
[1469.88s -> 1475.72s]  comma director, comma, um, world renowned physician, comma. I just add a lot of shit.
[1475.72s -> 1482.30s]  I just do a lot of things. Okay. Dear, dear big brother, I heard you have some hidden artistic
[1482.30s -> 1489.99s]  genes. I didn't know in a new studio in space. Why saying F? Stop saying F. Okay. Meanwhile,
[1489.99s -> 1494.07s]  yesterday was my birthday and I didn't get anything from you. So I suggest you paint me a great piece
[1494.07s -> 1498.89s]  of art to make up for it. I want a beautiful painting of a unicorn with plenty of colors.
[1498.89s -> 1504.33s]  Okay. You got it. A unicorn with colors. Well, I was about to paint the screen.
[1505.54s -> 1520.30s]  Okay. I'll do it here. Okay. So we need to do a unicorn and this would be beautiful.
[1520.30s -> 1527.06s]  Okay. Cool. You can throw an object with E. Yep. There's no paint on this. Pick up an object by
[1527.06s -> 1532.54s]  holding. Yep. Let me get used to the controls. You can jump some items have a special action.
[1532.54s -> 1540.25s]  Uh, press F to trigger it. Okay. Yeah. I can turn it. Cool. Press left control to crouch and paint
[1540.25s -> 1553.51s]  the ugly floor. Okay. Very cool. Nice. All right. It's time to paint a unicorn. Do I have access
[1553.51s -> 1559.46s]  to the whole studio? All right. Think of clouds. If they can lose, I'm thinking like a really nice
[1559.46s -> 1573.22s]  blue. Okay. Wait, how big does it need to be? Oh, right. All right. Here we go. I can move this
[1573.22s -> 1609.22s]  thing up and down. Can I? Yeah. No, I don't want green. Get that out of here. All right. I need,
[1609.22s -> 1640.49s]  um, I need more blue. Why? I don't need an easel. Fuck it. Looks pretty good so far. I gotta,
[1640.49s -> 1652.68s]  I gotta get up top though. Ruined. Not really. Let me go down actually. This is a 90s design.
[1652.92s -> 1668.70s]  Well, I'm a fucking 90s kid. Of course it's gonna be 90s. It's bad on purpose. This is not even,
[1668.70s -> 1676.04s]  I haven't even begun. I just put the, I just got the canvas. It's not even close. It looks pretty
[1676.04s -> 1684.02s]  good. It does actually look kind of good. It's not, it's not even close. Uh, I need more blue.
[1684.02s -> 1695.29s]  Is this empty? Yeah. How do I throw this away? Is there a trash? Uh, this is gonna be the trash
[1695.29s -> 1704.87s]  for now. All right. I want this. I want this and this. All right. Let's get that combined over here.
[1704.87s -> 1736.81s]  You throw trash into space. Hold on. I gotta flip it. I just, I gotta get it covered first.
[1736.81s -> 1741.21s]  I'm sorry. This is not a TikTok video. Yeah. It's gonna take me more. It's gonna take more
[1741.21s -> 1756.98s]  than 10 seconds for you to see this. Speed it up. No, I'm, what do you mean speed it up? I'm gonna
[1756.98s -> 1771.16s]  take my time. And this is actually going pretty fast for what I'm making here. I need a background,
[1771.16s -> 1774.36s]  obviously. All right. So this is pretty, this is getting close. I need to add a little bit of,
[1774.36s -> 1815.85s]  uh, finesse on here. Hold on. Yeah. Okay. Let's like this. I gotta get some texture on it. All
[1815.85s -> 1824.70s]  right. Now it's time. We've got our kind of a background here. Gifted Andy. It's ruined.
[1824.70s -> 1831.08s]  It is not ruined. I'm about to ruin it though, because I, you know, painting is not something.
[1831.08s -> 1847.72s]  Okay. Unicorn. Purple. Pink. Wait, I need to do outline first. White. I'm turning to go like
[1847.72s -> 1856.34s]  unicorn. Unicorn is like blue, like light blue. White. This is gonna, I'm gonna fuck this up.
[1856.34s -> 1861.67s]  All right. What does a unicorn look like? It needs to be perspective. All right. It's gonna be the
[1861.67s -> 1885.74s]  front of the unicorn's face. It's going to be like this. It's kind of a droopy nose. What does
[1885.74s -> 1927.77s]  an animal even look like? All right. What the fuck does a horse look like? I can fix it. What? Oh,
[1927.77s -> 1930.97s]  I thought the game, I thought I was doing so poorly that the game said you have to leave.
[1930.97s -> 1970.92s]  This kind of looks like a party hat. All right. Hold on. I'm not done. I did the same exact painting
[1970.92s -> 1975.91s]  the first time. The, the last stream, the same exact one. It's the exact same painting as the
[1975.91s -> 1980.90s]  first one I did last time. Identical. It was an alligator. The first one was an alligator,
[1980.90s -> 1990.54s]  wasn't it? It actually is the same exact thing. I made an alligator painting and it was the same
[1990.54s -> 2006.07s]  face. It needs, I know I'll give, hold on. Let me just get this done. You guys don't even know
[2006.07s -> 2075.88s]  what. Yeah. It's like turning this way. Unicorns have, um, this is fun. This is cool. They have an
[2075.88s -> 2082.44s]  ass horn. This one does. I need a thicker brush. This is too thin. It's gotta be way thicker than
[2082.44s -> 2091.03s]  this. Otherwise I sit here all day doing this. All right. This painting is for a sister as a gift.
[2091.03s -> 2099.54s]  All right. Let me finish this part. Oh, fuck. There's all this empty space over here. Um,
[2099.54s -> 2103.22s]  it's all right. I'll put hay over here. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[2103.22s -> 2114.02s]  Wait, hold on. Wait, one thing at a time. Should you, should you be like, like munching on hay?
[2114.02s -> 2165.82s]  You know what I mean? Like I need thinner than this. Shit. Don't go that far. Wonderful use of
[2165.82s -> 2175.94s]  colors. Yeah. No, no, no. I gotta lighten this up. I gotta wait. Hay is kind of darker, isn't it?
[2175.94s -> 2210.02s]  All right. I'll spray paint it too. This looks like Dark Ooga drew this. Is this too big of a
[2210.02s -> 2235.78s]  brush? I don't know. It might be. Is this too big? I'll fix it. Fuck. Sorry. I can fix it.
[2235.78s -> 2260.76s]  That looks like, uh, that looks okay. Control Z. There is no control Z. It's, uh, it's, it's an art
[2260.76s -> 2285.24s]  program. Wait, that's wrong. Okay. So, um, you gotta be like, looks like a Dark Souls boss.
[2285.24s -> 2302.70s]  It's like half the enemies in Bloodborne look like this. What about the ears? I don't, what does a
[2302.70s -> 2341.10s]  horse's ears look like? No. What do they look like? Uh, wait a minute. Can somebody do me a quick
[2341.10s -> 2350.60s]  favor and go get a screenshot of Grandpa is an MLG series I used to do on Machinima and the
[2350.60s -> 2361.94s]  thumbnail of that series? I need it right now. I need an image of it right now. Right now.
[2362.18s -> 2381.38s]  Somebody get it to me. Somebody get it to me right now. Get it yourself. I can. I'm busy.
[2381.38s -> 2405.54s]  Okay. So it is, it is what I thought it was going to be. It's almost, it's like the same image.
[2405.54s -> 2416.41s]  Okay. It's kind of close. This is like the, the, I don't even know. This is like a weird de-evolved
[2416.41s -> 2428.81s]  version of this image. I can only do one thing. Okay. Well, that's interesting. By the way, if
[2428.81s -> 2443.77s]  you haven't seen that series, uh, Grandpa is an MLG, Machinima got liquidated. It's gone. Okay.
[2443.77s -> 2451.08s]  Uh, so I can fix it though. I was trying to do the perspective,
[2451.08s -> 2458.68s]  kind of like a fish eye lens in a way that I'll think this is wrong. I'll do the eyes better,
[2458.68s -> 2511.27s]  but for now we need, Hey, no, it's not you. Hold on. I gotta have the lip come up. Can you tell me how
[2511.27s -> 2524.79s]  to use frat? You don't know how different the world was back then. Okay. Doing tutorials on how to do
[2524.79s -> 2530.95s]  just random shit. People were looking for stuff like that. Oh, how do I unlock this weapon in call
[2530.95s -> 2563.85s]  of duty, right? People made videos on it because it was, it didn't exist. I need like teeth. Horses
[2563.85s -> 2595.90s]  have really human teeth. Don't they? What does a horse's ears look like? They go down, right?
[2595.90s -> 2625.42s]  Are they pointy? They go, no, wait, hold on. They go back. They go search for a horse. Yeah. What
[2625.42s -> 2639.77s]  does a horse's face look like? They point up. Yeah, they do. They're tiny. Shit. All right. Hold on.
[2639.77s -> 2705.37s]  I gotta fix this then. I don't know why I thought they looked like that. Um, are you serious? I'm
[2705.37s -> 2749.38s]  hiding it. There we go. Okay. I can fix that up there. Let me finish the body. That's important.
[2749.38s -> 2826.02s]  Why would I wash this? I didn't want to put that there. Okay. I should have done this first. I'm
[2826.02s -> 2865.43s]  going to clean it up. I'll do some line work on it. Okay. I need to do some line work or I do this.
[2865.43s -> 2873.99s]  Hey, you would hang this up on your fridge. If this was an eight year old, you would. All right.
[2873.99s -> 2890.63s]  So I do like dark line, right? Yeah. Now I got to fill it in first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fill it in
[2890.63s -> 2910.66s]  first. I need a white. Yeah. Any white. I would buy this for a hundred dollars. He's 37. Yeah. You
[2910.66s -> 2917.26s]  don't magically just know how to draw because you're 37. This is not something that everybody
[2917.26s -> 2923.16s]  knows how to do. It's not like, oh yeah, you're 35 and older. You know how to draw. That's not how
[2923.16s -> 2946.46s]  it works. This is a skill that takes time to develop. I promise this will look a lot cleaner
[2946.46s -> 2956.15s]  in a minute. You have to trust the process of what I'm doing. Once it's cleaned up, everyone's
[2956.15s -> 2963.70s]  going to be like, oh, well actually it looks like kind of good. And those people get timed out.
[2963.70s -> 2972.89s]  How dare you not believe in me from the very beginning. They get timed out for a while too.
[2972.89s -> 2979.37s]  Like, I'm not going to have that here, right? I'm not going to have that. Yeah. I'm not going to
[2979.37s -> 2998.74s]  have that here. It's, it's scaring me. And I'm the one that drew it. The issue is this double nose
[2998.74s -> 3018.52s]  thing. It's like, it looks like Chester Cheetos, uh, unicorn cousin. This is an ad for some hay-like
[3019.08s -> 3038.94s]  cheese dusty snack. Imagine hay coming out of a bag. It kind of looks like what you smell like.
[3038.94s -> 3047.74s]  You don't know what I smell like. So that's interesting. It's not what you think either.
[3047.74s -> 3055.35s]  Oh my God. He must smell so good. No, not at all. It's fucking terrible. Disgusting. I smell awful.
[3055.35s -> 3066.12s]  Everything about me smells bad. Everything. Like when I go up and walk up and talk to somebody
[3066.12s -> 3094.23s]  and I'm like, oh, hey, what's up? They go, oh, because my breath is so fucking bad. I need more.
[3094.23s -> 3114.39s]  Now, you know what I smell like? I smell like, um, you know that the Axe body wash. So Axe body wash.
[3114.39s -> 3123.06s]  I go in the shower and I get a mound this high off my hand and I go pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
[3123.38s -> 3127.64s]  it hits all of my body and shit. And I don't guys like the way it feels. And I mush it all
[3127.64s -> 3150.55s]  over my hands and I put it all over my face and all of my body everywhere. And I let it sit there.
[3150.55s -> 3166.94s]  I don't do that. Got you. You're so far away now. It's so funny just how far away you really are.
[3166.94s -> 3175.16s]  Yeah. I got you. I got you. Yep. I was kidding around with you. If you're new to the channel,
[3175.16s -> 3193.75s]  we kind of, we mess around sometimes. Yeah. We kid around a lot. Yeah. I got you. Yep. You are a
[3193.75s -> 3219.03s]  prince of lies. But, um, they have hooves, right? Kind of like this. And then this is going to be
[3219.03s -> 3251.70s]  gray. I'm going to have to call that pretty good, um, hand, uh, stability. That was pretty good.
[3251.70s -> 3261.16s]  Give the horse underwear. Maybe. We'll see. I will see what inspiration hits me. First it was the
[3261.16s -> 3272.79s]  hay. I don't know. We'll see. I don't know. I have no idea what's going to happen. I don't know. I
[3272.79s -> 3277.82s]  might just get unhappy with this and drop kick this and put two huge shoe prints on it and then
[3277.82s -> 3285.62s]  throw it away. Well, I don't know. It depends on what I, it depends on my inspiration. And then
[3285.62s -> 3291.59s]  someone will find it and it'll have a ton of value because the artist that didn't like his own
[3291.59s -> 3297.99s]  material, the shoe, right? That would be kind of interesting. This was found in the dumpster or
[3297.99s -> 3320.81s]  something, right? It's got shoe prints on it. They kicked it. That might be interesting. Your life
[3320.81s -> 3351.93s]  isn't a movie, Jerma. What is this? It's not done is what it is. You can't just come in here and say,
[3351.93s -> 3367.08s]  what is this? Until you see the whole thing. I think I'm going to, let's clean this up. Yeah.
[3367.08s -> 3379.75s]  I only cleaned this up. We're going to go super abstract for the next one. I'm telling you. I
[3379.83s -> 3421.45s]  need a thicker brush. This one here. I can fix it if I need to. I'll do, I'll redo this line.
[3421.45s -> 3437.98s]  Do you not know how an outline works? I know nothing about painting or drawing. I just do it
[3437.98s -> 3449.77s]  when it's fun. This is fun. All right. What am I going to, what am I going to do here? I know I
[3449.77s -> 3482.34s]  have to fix a lot of this. Hold on. Yeah. Give me, let's get this fixed. These are too big. It's
[3482.34s -> 3499.10s]  okay though. These are way too big. What do the horse's eyes look like? I don't think kind of like
[3499.10s -> 3504.76s]  on other, like bird eyes, aren't they? There's like an eye here and an eye here. It's like a bird.
[3504.76s -> 3551.00s]  That's how it works, right? Yeah. Let me fix this then. I need a purple. What's this? Whoa. Oh
[3551.00s -> 3574.84s]  shit. That's way too dark. I need this in a, there we go. Yeah. Give me that. Is this better?
[3574.84s -> 3614.33s]  Kind of. A little bit. I'll fix it in post. Very clearly the eyes were here. Damn it. I can't do
[3614.33s -> 3622.12s]  subjects. I can do, I can do interesting color stuff. I can't draw a subject. I can make some.
[3622.12s -> 3637.86s]  You'll see. I can, I'll fix it in a minute. My God damn it. I fucking ruined everything. I actually
[3637.86s -> 3726.70s]  just ruined it. Not if it's a cyborg guy. Good start. I'm thinking like, like Kano from Mortal
[3726.70s -> 3766.22s]  Kombat, right? All right. Now is the purple. Okay. You ruined it again. No, I didn't because I can,
[3766.22s -> 3780.02s]  I can work with that. Here's my, there it is. I have to clean this workstation up. This is awful.
[3780.02s -> 3802.71s]  This horse is awesome now. I told you to wait until it was done. Everyone's freaking out about,
[3802.71s -> 3811.42s]  it doesn't look good. Just wait till it's done. Done, done, done. Take it before and after. You
[3811.42s -> 3864.42s]  need to trust me. That's kind of scary actually. I'd pay $500,000 for this. I would not sell it for
[3864.42s -> 3870.78s]  $500,000. I would be a shame to sell it to you for that much. I would be saying, no, no, no, no,
[3870.78s -> 3874.90s]  no, no, dude, dude. It's all right. In fact, you would, you would probably show up with a briefcase
[3874.90s -> 3878.82s]  with like a hundred dollar bills in it. And I'd be holding this in my hand and be like, oh dude,
[3878.82s -> 3882.62s]  I'm going to give you $500,000 for this. I'd be like, dude, just, just fucking have it. Just take
[3882.62s -> 3905.19s]  it. I just, you can just have this for 50 bucks. Take this, take this from me. All right. I need a
[3905.19s -> 3924.41s]  bigger brush because yeah, I'm trying to figure out if I need to just thin this. I, it's got to
[3924.41s -> 3967.14s]  be thinner. Yeah. This edge part can't be here. So let's go like this. I'll fix the rest. Thanks.
[3967.14s -> 3997.37s]  I need more white. Yeah. Well, maybe we'll do it. I'm going to do one of my own and then maybe we
[3997.37s -> 4000.49s]  could do some abstract stuff. Maybe you guys can give you some tools that I could only use
[4000.49s -> 4011.66s]  or something. I don't know how it works, but we'll try it. I need to, that water is dirty.
[4011.66s -> 4017.70s]  If you're wondering why I did that, it's going to start to not work. Okay. Almost. We're actually
[4017.70s -> 4040.62s]  pretty close to being done to do some detail work. I don't want to lose this part. I need the line
[4040.62s -> 4061.67s]  here. I need more water. Water. Where's water? How do you just place it down? Oh, come on. How do I,
[4061.67s -> 4081.93s]  how do I put it down just normally? Is it? No, it's not E. How do I do it? Okay. There we go.
[4081.93s -> 4088.57s]  Uh, where's my brush? Okay. So I just got to fill this in and we can start to actually make some
[4088.57s -> 4104.76s]  cool changes here. I got to kind of remember where some of this stuff was because there's a line that
[4104.76s -> 4119.83s]  needs to be here. What does this look like? This looks like something. What does this actually look
[4119.83s -> 4127.82s]  like? It looks like, um, fuck it's, uh, I don't know. Somebody will see it, right? No, no, no,
[4127.82s -> 4156.62s]  not sans. Something else. The dog from Toy Story? The dog from Toy Story. It looks like, hold on.
[4156.62s -> 4186.47s]  Toy Story. Toy Story dog. No, it does not. Remember he's like, like chewing like that.
[4186.47s -> 4191.51s]  So we know we got that done. Okay. I got to be very careful here because this is kind of the way I
[4191.51s -> 4207.88s]  want it. I just have to do some line work. Yeah. All right. Give me this. What the hell just happened?
[4207.88s -> 4262.39s]  Bring me up. I'm concentrating. Relax. I'll put some more, um, Kano I smoke in a minute. Actually,
[4262.39s -> 4282.84s]  this is kind of good. I can get rid of the big chunky gross part. I got to give it a little
[4282.84s -> 4305.21s]  bit texture at the bottom because it's like coming out. All right. Almost there. We'll do some more.
[4305.21s -> 4310.02s]  We'll do some more touch up work later. But for the most part, this is almost ready to start doing
[4310.02s -> 4341.32s]  some detail with the face. Why is this different color? Am I getting paid for this? Oh, this is a
[4341.32s -> 4352.26s]  birthday present. Hmm. It's a birthday present. I can't just like send you like a $50 gift card
[4352.26s -> 4363.72s]  to Applebee's and have it be a card with a cat on it, a little kitten with a party hat on and then
[4363.80s -> 4372.89s]  write, Hey, scratch this off your list. Dinner's on me tonight with like a cat scratch. Why can't
[4372.89s -> 4397.46s]  I just do that? Okay. Let's do this. I actually, I'm just going to, I can fix this in a minute
[4397.46s -> 4402.70s]  because I'm going to put some, uh, we'll add some more lines on top of it. So it doesn't look like
[4402.70s -> 4419.08s]  it's in front. The perspective is going to change. So just wait. It'll be fine. How come there's no
[4419.08s -> 4428.66s]  fifth leg? If you want me to draw a horse dick, I'm sorry. That's not going to happen on this stream.
[4428.66s -> 4450.62s]  This is actually tricky, but whatever. I need you to be more, this is going to start to look weird.
[4450.62s -> 4479.61s]  Okay. There we go. That's better. It's fine. Don't worry. I don't want to mess with this
[4479.61s -> 4488.70s]  because it's already under his lip. This is the leg that's the front in front of the camera the
[4488.70s -> 4496.70s]  most. That's gotta be the biggest one. All right. It's time to start doing this. Time to actually
[4496.70s -> 4502.28s]  care about this. Give me. All right. I don't want to screw this up. Let me think how this would
[4502.28s -> 4547.26s]  actually look with the same type of, it's like kind of looks like, huh? Hey, wait. I was like,
[4547.74s -> 4558.39s]  what happened? What are you talking about? What? Where'd you get this? I'm so confused. What's
[4558.39s -> 4589.90s]  going on? Did I steal this? Who's is this? Snooze and copter drew this. That's just,
[4589.90s -> 4604.30s]  that's just the ice cream truck version of that. What you drew. Wow. That's unbelievable. All right.
[4604.30s -> 4616.86s]  Well, cool. Should I just stop? Did I just stop my painting? Wow. That's actually awesome. All
[4616.86s -> 4629.69s]  right. Well, snooze and copter. That's awesome. Um, I feel like I can't even make mine now.
[4629.69s -> 4634.98s]  This is the part of the movie. Jerma, your life's not a movie. I don't care. This is the part of the
[4634.98s -> 4642.10s]  movie when we're at the talent show and we both did the same thing and mine sucks. And I have to
[4642.10s -> 4647.40s]  figure out what I'm going to do instead. And the guy with the headset comes over. He's like, hey,
[4647.40s -> 4652.89s]  you ready to show what you, what you did for the talent show? And I'm just like, um, uh, yeah.
[4653.61s -> 4660.38s]  And then I come up with a dance routine that wins everybody over. And I beat your painting,
[4660.38s -> 4675.74s]  by the way, try to get up and dance. And ladies and gentlemen, here he is showcasing his art,
[4675.74s -> 4679.98s]  Jeremy Albertson. And I walk on stage and I'm like looking nervous, sweating. And I grabbed the mic
[4679.98s -> 4684.84s]  and it goes, okay, everybody, huh? Well, I was going to drop something and then like night,
[4684.84s -> 4690.81s]  like really sad kind of uplifting music starts playing. Well, I was going to draw for you today,
[4690.81s -> 4697.67s]  but I was going to bring you a painting, but it felt like, no, I wanted to do something different.
[4697.67s -> 4704.76s]  You're in, you inspired them. Why are you acting like this? It's not a talent show. They just were
[4704.76s -> 4715.06s]  inspired by what you were doing. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I mean. Why are you so insecure? I'm
[4715.06s -> 4729.75s]  just walking around. That was a phenomenal painting though. Seriously. But check mine out. Yeah.
[4729.75s -> 4741.11s]  Check mine out. I might not be the fastest, the brightest. I might not have what it takes,
[4741.11s -> 4756.01s]  but there's something that I do know. I have perseverance and I have gumption. And then a fat
[4756.01s -> 4768.15s]  boy, slim song comes on and I start doing like a Napoleon dynamite dance. You're an anime character.
[4768.15s -> 4777.48s]  Yeah. Shut up. Help. Help. Help with what? What's wrong? All right. So I need to make the lip go.
[4777.48s -> 4810.73s]  I can fix this. Hold on. Oh, yay. I think I'll be all right. Just to do more of the,
[4810.73s -> 4818.09s]  Hey, all right. We're going to make sure the head is correct. This is the moment of truth.
[4823.00s -> 4879.98s]  It's perfect. I need the other eye. Teeth too. Shit. All right. It's a moose. It does kind of
[4879.98s -> 4890.22s]  look like a moose snoozing copter. I didn't mean to show off. I just wanted to draw along like
[4890.22s -> 4896.49s]  Bob Ross. You're a vision. No, I'm not. Don't take it that way. I'm just messing around, man.
[4896.49s -> 4903.03s]  It was awesome. It was actually fucking, it was a great, it was a great part of this drape,
[4903.03s -> 4915.14s]  actually. It was funny. Kind of looks like a duck. It does kind of look like a duck. What about the
[4915.14s -> 4949.74s]  other eye? What should I do with the other eye? I need the nostrils too. It just kind of looks like
[4949.74s -> 4969.86s]  he has rotten teeth. He's got fucked up rotten teeth. Okay. Um, I can fix this if I go like this.
[4969.86s -> 4976.17s]  All right. I got to change some things here. I need white. Do I still have any white left in here?
[4976.17s -> 4998.23s]  No, of course not. Wait, there's a spongy tool. Hold on. That didn't do anything. I need white.
[4998.23s -> 5003.82s]  I need to do teeth and then I need to do the eye and then do some detail work and I'm done.
[5003.82s -> 5066.33s]  It looks pretty good from far away. Okay. Let's do some teeth. All right. I'm actually not unhappy
[5066.33s -> 5152.46s]  with this. Oh, fuck. I have to do it in the other color. Okay. That looks good. I'm not going to say
[5152.46s -> 5192.74s]  anything. Okay. Now I just need to add a little bit in there. Should there be a shoulder coming
[5192.74s -> 5196.86s]  out or something here? This feels weird. Like it cuts off too quick. You know what I'm saying?
[5196.86s -> 5203.62s]  Kind of have like a little bump like here. That makes sense, right? Does that make sense? I hope
[5203.62s -> 5223.19s]  it makes sense. I hope so. Cause I'm just going to do it. Fuck. It looks terrible. Hold on. Does
[5223.19s -> 5284.14s]  that make any sense? I don't know. Find out. This game has background music. Can you not hear
[5284.14s -> 5309.90s]  anything? Has it been quiet the whole time? Oh shit. Sorry. Now let me see if this works.
[5309.90s -> 5321.66s]  Cause now once the detail work comes out, this will actually look a little better. It's going
[5321.66s -> 5326.44s]  to look weird and it's going to look like a weird cartoon, but whatever. I think it's going to be
[5326.44s -> 5331.10s]  fine. And then I'm done. I'm done after this. Cause I want to do another painting. I want you guys
[5331.10s -> 5356.25s]  to choose. It doesn't look right, but fine. Something about doesn't look right, but whatever.
[5367.05s -> 5376.23s]  Needs another eye. All right. So what should I do for this eye? How about just like purple?
[5381.51s -> 5388.66s]  Is this a bit, I don't know how to draw. I mean, is, is not knowing how to do something a routine?
[5388.66s -> 5410.04s]  No, I just don't know how to draw. What is it? Wait, do you think I'm pretending to not know how
[5410.04s -> 5413.80s]  to draw and I actually do, and I'm going to do the next one? It's going to be fucking sick.
[5413.80s -> 5446.73s]  That actually would be kind of funny. I like the texture on that. Ooh, I like it. You idiot
[5446.73s -> 5457.29s]  fucking ruined it. I'm doing the two feet prints. Just stick right in the middle. I'm going to jump
[5457.29s -> 5462.49s]  and lay out on my back. So my back is parallel to the ground and kick as hard as I can right here
[5462.49s -> 5489.03s]  into the, into the front. Cause I just fucked that up. Okay. Getting close to being done.
[5489.03s -> 5496.10s]  Eyebrows. Do horses have eyebrows? They do, right? Kind of, but this one's going to have eyebrows.
[5496.10s -> 5535.03s]  Okay. They have this though. I know for a fact, like a little opening, right?
[5535.03s -> 5556.04s]  Looks a little strange, but whatever. There needs to be more texture here. All right. Wait,
[5556.04s -> 5581.94s]  I need texture, texture, texture, texture, texture like that. Here we go. This is going to ruin it
[5581.94s -> 5617.35s]  or it's going to make it look much better. Find out. Fuck you. It's glowing, actually glowing.
[5617.35s -> 5686.87s]  I'm fine. It's fine. It looks, it actually looks cool. I was trying to smudge it a little.
[5686.87s -> 5736.79s]  That actually looks kind of cool. Look at how magical this is. What do you mean? Stop, stop,
[5736.79s -> 5749.66s]  stop. What I think it looks better than it did. Now we truly go through and fix the details.
[5749.66s -> 5808.94s]  I want to do some more line work. Where's the hair? Um, I don't have the tool to do that.
[5813.19s -> 5817.19s]  I got to fix this and then I'm do one more pass with the line and then I'm done. And I'm going
[5817.19s -> 5823.99s]  to sell it to my sister or an Applebee's gift card. Maybe should the outline be purple?
[5831.70s -> 5855.10s]  Yeah. You made an NFT. Yeah. But I mean the combination of the hay in the mouth and the
[5855.10s -> 5881.03s]  two Kano eyes, it's got to be worth at least one Ethereum. I actually don't think I want to add
[5881.03s -> 5885.74s]  that much more line stuff. Yeah. I don't like that. Let's fix that right now. Quick, quick,
[5885.74s -> 5891.74s]  quick, quick herb before it dries. That's all right. Okay. So he's, why does this have white on
[5891.74s -> 5908.34s]  it? Why does this have white on it? Oh my God. He's phasing into reality. Oh my goodness. This is,
[5908.34s -> 5993.37s]  this is worth it. 25 people. He's phasing in. Are you kidding me? This is white. What the fuck?
[5993.37s -> 6044.04s]  All right. It's time for the finishing touch. Let me practice. Two shoe prints. Well, so it
[6044.04s -> 6088.57s]  will be like, it kind of looks like two feet prints. That's my signature. Dude, you're cooked.
[6088.57s -> 6098.47s]  I'm fine. All right. How do I get this off the wall? Why is it brown? Cause I got dirty ass feet.
[6098.47s -> 6109.69s]  Okay. There it is. It's complete. It's time to, I'm going to give you 20 seconds. All right. Here
[6109.69s -> 6122.42s]  you go. You ready? 30 seconds. Rate my painting. What do you think? Is it between zero and 10?
[6122.42s -> 6158.60s]  I think you guys are breaking it. And a 6.5. That's not bad. I'm okay with that. All right.
[6158.68s -> 6180.66s]  Let's send it. Okay. How much money? I just made money. How do you clean?
[6187.53s -> 6199.03s]  Is that a good wah or a bad wah? Is that a, is that a Waluigi wah? Like you fell off the side
[6199.03s -> 6216.74s]  of a cliff Wiley Coyote style, or is that a wow? This is great. Okay. I got to go to my email.
[6216.74s -> 6243.00s]  Cleaning is more fun than painting for me. I love this. I love this. Is there a business
[6243.00s -> 6249.90s]  where you can just kind of clean, like paint off a wall like this? Cause they, around it,
[6249.90s -> 6255.99s]  they have the stuff where you break things. I don't know what's, what's going on with the,
[6255.99s -> 6261.94s]  oh, let's have it be going and you smash stuff with a hammer. I want where you clean stuff.
[6261.94s -> 6269.59s]  I want to power wash a dirty driveway. I want to use a sponge on like a dirty wall and clean it.
[6269.59s -> 6279.78s]  Should I just become, do, be like a janitor, be like a, be a power washer, do power washing.
[6281.22s -> 6288.58s]  Yeah. Okay. Here's the thing. I wouldn't be able to do a professional job doing it.
[6288.58s -> 6293.88s]  Right. It's not like, oh, just, I'll just do power washing. I'll just, I'll sell a power washing
[6293.88s -> 6299.22s]  business. No, no, no. I just want to clean dirt off of the wall. I don't think I'll do very well.
[6301.98s -> 6306.74s]  Right. Like I just want to do it just, oh, we like put dirt on this wall and you just
[6306.74s -> 6327.21s]  spray it off. It's a weed store. You go in and you just smoke, there's like a thousand different
[6327.21s -> 6332.23s]  kinds of joints. So you pick which one you want, you smoke it. And then they bring you into the
[6332.23s -> 6339.83s]  room where you could just play with a bunch of toys. Dude, man, you can, yeah, you could, by the
[6339.83s -> 6345.70s]  way, you can power wash this wall. It's like a 15 foot wall. Power wash it, man. What? Yeah. Or you
[6345.70s -> 6355.02s]  can just watch me do it. Oh yeah. Can I just sit in the chair and watch you do it? Hey bro, you know
[6355.02s -> 6361.18s]  those baby toys that we have at the doctor's offices? We've got a huge one. Oh, you put the
[6361.18s -> 6368.41s]  beads around the, with the wire. You do? Yeah, man. Yeah. Hey, you don't, you don't gotta play with
[6368.41s -> 6384.92s]  it. You just watch me. Oh yeah. Can I just watch you do it? Don't operate machine. No, I'm not
[6384.92s -> 6391.77s]  talking about like heavy machinery. I'm talking about just like easy toys or something. Like I
[6391.77s -> 6405.34s]  could watch somebody power watch a driveway while I'm high. Dude, why don't you just find a power
[6405.34s -> 6412.86s]  washing business and be like, Hey, can I just like come with you to a job and just get high?
[6412.86s -> 6417.32s]  I'll pay you just to sit there in a chair and just watch the power washing. I could probably
[6417.32s -> 6432.47s]  just do that. A ride along power. Yeah. A ride along power washing thing. What a weirdo.
[6443.91s -> 6448.55s]  Can I come with you to the doctor's so I can just play with the toy in the waiting room?
[6449.51s -> 6468.34s]  That's weird. That's not, that one won't work. That one's not going to work. Um, just buy the
[6468.34s -> 6483.86s]  toy. Hey, hot doctor asks you to power watch him power wash the driveway. Sorry, I don't mean to
[6483.86s -> 6491.62s]  annoy you. I just want to watch the surgery. Literally just buy it, dude. It's called a bead
[6491.62s -> 6510.55s]  maze. Where's the trash? No, you're fucking with my stupid, uh, scenario that I'm coming up with.
[6510.55s -> 6514.79s]  Wouldn't be honest with me. What is a job or a business that you really don't think you could do
[6515.43s -> 6520.38s]  that takes skill to do that you would just like to watch? Like wood cutting.
[6520.38s -> 6524.82s]  Can I just watch somebody cut wood? But I want to be there. It doesn't, when you, when you watch it
[6524.82s -> 6530.41s]  on a video, it's like, Oh, the person like chopping the wood. It's like, Oh, that's so cool. But I
[6530.41s -> 6533.69s]  want to like be there. I'm gonna smell the wood. I want to be there and just like hear the sounds
[6533.69s -> 6538.68s]  and just be like out in the, in the woods, just hanging out. Can I just watch somebody cut wood
[6538.68s -> 6560.06s]  just with a big ax, just chopping the wood painting. Yeah. Sculpting porn. No, I don't,
[6560.06s -> 6567.37s]  I don't want to watch someone make porn. That's not what I don't know. I know I'm talking about,
[6568.17s -> 6580.95s]  I don't know. I'm talking about just satisfying stuff. I think this is cleaning up. So now let's
[6580.95s -> 6590.20s]  go check the email. I just received my unicorn while I have the digital version, the real
[6590.20s -> 6594.68s]  painting will take a little longer. Um, your unicorn is a little weird, but let's just say it's,
[6594.68s -> 6598.84s]  but let's say it's approved. I will name it Ragnarok because it looks like it will bring
[6598.84s -> 6609.43s]  about the apocalypse. I, oh wait, this is a, wait, this is my sister. It's a great name. You're just
[6609.43s -> 6613.75s]  jealous of my unicorn naming skills. But anyway, I'm having an online call with some friends of
[6613.75s -> 6617.19s]  mine. I'm showing them your painting. Good luck with your artist stuff and everything. What do
[6617.19s -> 6641.98s]  you mean? Hmm. Good luck with your artist stuff. What is that? Okay. Oh, cool. I'm ready.
[6641.98s -> 6656.22s]  Your artist stuff. Okay. Let's go. You can paint whatever you want. Follow your creative impulses.
[6657.02s -> 6668.28s]  Printer. Wait, I can make a, I can do a printer. Cool. All right, let's do it. So what do I got?
[6673.66s -> 6688.63s]  Now what? You don't have any commissions yet. Should I just do whatever I want? Um, challenge
[6688.63s -> 6706.87s]  my skills. Which one? You can go off the email that you just read. Okay. I think I just have,
[6706.87s -> 6722.22s]  okay. I just have to make stuff and sell it. Make the horror. I don't think I can. That's
[6722.22s -> 6730.17s]  way too big. No, no, no, no, no, no. Give me something else. I want a little one. We're going
[6730.17s -> 6756.54s]  to get a little one. This is too big. I just want a small one. Here we go. I need an easel.
[6756.54s -> 6788.26s]  What's an easel? There it is. Okay. This thing out. Okay. It's an ICU. Yeah, it is an ICU. All
[6788.26s -> 6790.58s]  right. So what am I going to, what am I, I got to do something quick. Something without, without
[6790.58s -> 6799.02s]  thinking about it. I'm thinking, uh, just don't think, just do it. Just don't think. I'm just
[6799.02s -> 6805.45s]  going to, I'm not going to think I'm just going to do it. I don't want to see any tools yet.
[6805.45s -> 6821.53s]  What am I feeling? What am I feeling? I'm feeling a, um, what color am I feeling? Slate. Yeah.
[6822.01s -> 6841.72s]  Slate. What are the colors am I feeling? Slate. I'm feeling, uh, a little deeper of a slate blue.
[6841.72s -> 6871.06s]  I'm also feeling, uh, yeah, sand, olive. Okay. And it'd be a bright yellow. Let's go. All right.
[6871.06s -> 6875.13s]  I'm not going to think. I'm just going to go for it. I need, I need a bucket of water. All right.
[6875.13s -> 6985.42s]  We're going to do, we're going to start with tornado, a fury of wind and rock. Where did the
[6985.42s -> 7124.50s]  fucking yellow come from? Oh, actually kind of cool. Why would you do that? I need the inspiration.
[7124.50s -> 7148.06s]  I need a small, really thin one. I need a thin brush, a really small one. Can I buy,
[7148.06s -> 7170.39s]  where can I buy it from the computer? No, I can't access the store. Where's the little paintbrush?
[7170.39s -> 7186.09s]  Okay. Here we go. That's good. Don't think, don't think too hard about it. Just do it.
[7186.09s -> 7231.64s]  Give me the sponge. Quick, quick, quick sponge, sponge, sponge, sponge, sponge. I hope this works.
[7231.64s -> 7249.56s]  Just trust it, right? Just trust it. I didn't do what I wanted to do. I thought it was going
[7249.56s -> 7259.03s]  to smudge it. I didn't, I thought, okay, because I thought, so I wet it and I, I tried to go like
[7259.03s -> 7269.69s]  this to get the water off and I thought I was going to smudge it. That was kind of cool. You
[7269.69s -> 7273.29s]  have to use a blender too. I don't have it. I thought I could like smudge it with a sponge
[7273.29s -> 7278.74s]  and just go like wham. So it looked like a gust of wind. Why wet it first? I didn't want to paint on
[7278.74s -> 7283.34s]  it. And then I thought if I like did it on the ground for a minute and like did like over here
[7283.34s -> 7291.72s]  for a second, it would be not wet anymore. Um, it's okay. This actually might be kind of cool
[7291.72s -> 7309.51s]  if I can salvage it, which I'll try. Actually, wait a minute. That might've been a good thing.
[7310.07s -> 7355.62s]  Actually, not really a bad thing. Did you see this fucking swirling action? Do you see that?
[7355.62s -> 7638.26s]  Turn a quick cut your ear off. What? Yeah. He's like, okay. Yeah. You can faintly. I want you to
[7638.26s -> 7643.96s]  faintly see the face. I need one more thing to put the cherry on top of this. Yeah. Be careful. I
[7643.96s -> 7658.82s]  don't want to screw it up. Oh, I know. I'll smudge it with this. I only have $71. I feel like there
[7658.82s -> 7675.46s]  needs to be something else in the middle. Is this too much or is it good? I need a cloud. Okay.
[7675.46s -> 7689.46s]  Well, what if I do this? Like I'm talking like that and like very faint. Now it's done. Sell it.
[7689.46s -> 7731.78s]  How do I sell this? That's just trash. Oh, okay. No, no, no. Flip it around. Oh, okay. What do you
[7731.78s -> 7739.59s]  give this for a rating? Too much light on it. I would, I would have, I would mood light this.
[7739.59s -> 7773.06s]  What do you think? Oh, I got up. Did I sell it? 7.5. Okay. Cool. That's not bad. Isn't there a bunch
[7773.06s -> 7781.40s]  of weird shit too? Oh, cause I'm in like story mode. I get it. This is like a paint cannon.
[7781.40s -> 7786.09s]  There's, there's a lot of cool stuff to do. Try to just keep, try to play this more. Would
[7786.09s -> 7800.68s]  you guys want to see more of this? How do you guys feel? Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe I'll just come back
[7800.68s -> 7810.92s]  to this in a couple days or something. You guys having a good time? All right. We'll play like
[7810.92s -> 7819.96s]  another half an hour. Cause then I do, I want to play multi-versus. Should I just play this
[7819.96s -> 7826.94s]  literally in like two or three days? Just that's what we're doing when I come back. Okay. Yeah.
[7826.94s -> 7832.04s]  We'll just do this again on this weekend or whatever it is. I'm having fun. It's just a,
[7832.04s -> 7836.34s]  it's a fun game just to chill and play. All right. Let's get one more going here. How about you guys
[7836.34s -> 7849.42s]  can you guys decide? All right. Challenge my skills. I'm gonna need a little longer.
[7849.42s -> 7874.14s]  Paint with two colors, rotating easel only in one minute to paint. Oh, and the winner is
[7874.14s -> 7911.27s]  rotating easel only rotating easel. How do I do that? Small easel. Where is it? Make the canvas
[7911.27s -> 7927.85s]  spin. Yeah. How do I do that? I do that from here. Let it do auto rotate. Um, the blue attachment on
[7927.85s -> 7941.67s]  the easel. Oh, okay. Let me see. What do I, there it is. I get a very, I need a bigger canvas than
[7941.67s -> 7951.11s]  this. I'll use, I'll save this one for later. Let's get a, I guess that it seemed like a size
[7951.11s -> 7967.02s]  I can do. That's fine. Put it on here. You said the blue one, you need to buy a new easel. Oh,
[7967.02s -> 7977.29s]  really? That's not your easel. What the hell is this then? You don't have the one that rotates yet.
[7977.29s -> 8012.34s]  Oh, well we're doing another challenge. Only spray paint 30 seconds to paint or use a single tool.
[8012.34s -> 8019.54s]  Looks like spray paint is going to win by a lot. All right. I'm going to make, um, what can you even
[8019.54s -> 8027.26s]  do with spray paint? I'm going to do a lot of blues. Maybe the, maybe the green. I think it looks
[8027.26s -> 8036.41s]  all right. Maybe green and oh, I got some points. All right. How about this? So look only spray paint.
[8036.41s -> 8052.97s]  How's this look? Let's get a, let's get a blue background. I'm going to saturate this completely
[8052.97s -> 8075.46s]  by the way. Complete saturation. You can't even see what the hell I'm doing. Am I even on the screen?
[8075.46s -> 8105.53s]  There we go. Press F. Oh, scattered. Excuse me? How does that make any sense? What just happened?
[8105.53s -> 8136.76s]  How am I painting the windows? All right. That looks good. I kind of like that. All right. Now
[8136.76s -> 8143.94s]  we're going to do, not much I can do with spray paint. How about, okay, we're going to do this color,
[8143.94s -> 8149.54s]  this color. Yeah. We're going to do this color here. Oh, I got, this one's going to come up
[8149.54s -> 8201.48s]  because of the seafoam.
[8229.53s -> 8249.29s]  Call this one the flu. I call this one microscopic germs. It's mold.
[8319.85s -> 8374.38s]  Look at all the layers.
[8404.94s -> 8461.56s]  Get a load of that one. Get a load of that one. I don't know why I want to do this, but
[8461.56s -> 8466.10s]  I want to do this. I don't know why I want to do this, but I'm going to do it.
[8466.10s -> 8469.54s]  Something's making me do this. I'm just like, Hey, do this now. You should definitely do this.
[8469.54s -> 8630.79s]  Done. Sorry. I really concentrated on that one. I added so many layers that you can't even see the
[8630.79s -> 8638.86s]  other layers. I, it was perfect before and I kind of fucked it up, but whatever. I actually screwed
[8638.86s -> 8661.38s]  it up, but that's fine. It's art. Ooh, 6.3 ain't bad. All right. One more, let's do one more
[8661.38s -> 8679.53s]  challenge. And then I'm going to play multiverses. Eyes closed. Oh no, no, no. All right. I need a
[8679.53s -> 8702.12s]  small canvas for this. Is that too small? Just a one by one. All right. Eyes closed. I need to get
[8702.12s -> 8712.92s]  set. I feel like I did this one already, but all right, let me just get rid of this. Use the huge
[8712.92s -> 8717.48s]  canvas. Big canvas. Big canvas. But how am I going to ever, I'm not going to be able to go up or down.
[8717.48s -> 8746.87s]  Okay. Let me get my tools ready. This is going to be right here. You are stupid. Okay. There's that.
[8747.51s -> 8753.94s]  I want a new easel. I don't want an easel. I want to be able to remember where paint is over here.
[8753.94s -> 8765.86s]  An easel would be too hard. I need to block it out. So from here it's one, one, two, I need like
[8765.86s -> 8775.77s]  three colors. Okay. So let's do that. We're going to go with, um, how about a, I don't know, this
[8775.77s -> 8796.06s]  kind of lavender. And actually I do need an easel. I need a ton of it because I need to be able to
[8796.06s -> 8819.94s]  miss. I think it looks like delicious. Lavender, maybe a, one of these, like a light blue, maybe
[8819.94s -> 8834.31s]  white. Oh, maybe one of these. How's this? It's yellow. Grapes. Gittles. I haven't, I'm out of
[8834.31s -> 8846.87s]  money. Mine is $3. What? I'm in debt right now. That's weird. What do you think? Like this? I like
[8846.87s -> 8871.30s]  like an orange or something. Yeah. Orange. That. And then maybe a green. I have a plan if this
[8871.30s -> 8879.94s]  doesn't work. And then what? Maybe light green. You need to put a blindfold on. No, I don't. I'm not
[8879.94s -> 8900.09s]  going to cheat. I'm thinking of green. Skittles. Yeah. Like the skittle is tropical either, or
[8900.09s -> 8916.49s]  maybe gray or like a dark red. What do you think? Just paint a hot dog. Turn off the monitor. Light
[8916.49s -> 8935.32s]  green. Like a lime green. Oh yeah. That might work. Yeah. Let's do that. I don't even know what I'm
[8935.32s -> 8938.20s]  going to do with this though. If I can't see what I'm doing on a huge canvas, it's going to be a
[8938.20s -> 8943.59s]  mess. I'm just going to let it do. I'm going to let my body decide what it's going to just go for
[8943.59s -> 8954.74s]  it. Okay. So in the middle we have orange. I want to be able to reach, I need to be able to reach
[8954.74s -> 8966.55s]  the whole canvas. I think that's good. I need my roller. Can I reach it? Okay. I can reach the
[8966.55s -> 8974.44s]  whole canvas from here. And now I got my brushes. Okay. How do I prove to you guys that I can't see?
[8974.44s -> 8984.60s]  Um, I actually got to put a bag on my head or something. Hold on. Give me one sec. I don't,
[8984.60s -> 9197.66s]  I don't have a blind blue. Where am I going to go? Oh, let me, let me see if I can find something.
[9197.66s -> 9212.17s]  Okay. I found something. So this is going to work. Not see through or anything. Uh, it's no,
[9212.17s -> 9222.82s]  it's not a duck beanie. I think I could just do this. So I was at the G4 studios to do obviously
[9222.82s -> 9229.66s]  Name Your Price and Hey Donna. And I got this like this G4 thing. I don't know what this is.
[9229.66s -> 9239.48s]  Like a cloth. I could just go like this. Wait, does that work? And I can't see through this.
[9239.48s -> 9255.58s]  It's pretty breathable. G4 ad. I didn't steal it. What do you mean I stole it? No, I didn't.
[9255.58s -> 9259.83s]  No, they, they, they gave this to me. They said, Hey man, here's some, some cool stuff.
[9259.83s -> 9267.03s]  I didn't steal this. I didn't like take this from the green room. All right. Hey,
[9267.03s -> 9272.57s]  G4 TV. You're over. You just saw in real time. We fucked that up. I thought you were right here
[9272.57s -> 9276.57s]  because that's where you usually are. You're over there now. And I did the thing where I
[9276.57s -> 9282.09s]  looked into the camera and it's not the right spot. All right, here we go. I don't know how
[9282.09s -> 9292.07s]  much time limit you're censoring your face with a G4 ad. That's funny. That's fine. I don't care.
[9292.07s -> 9299.38s]  All right, G4. Here we are. That this is not affiliated with this stream is not affiliated
[9299.38s -> 9303.62s]  with G4 in any way at the moment right now. There's nothing that G4 is not part of this
[9303.62s -> 9307.86s]  stream here. I just, this is a cool, uh, towel that I got and it's, it's pretty cool. And I'm
[9307.86s -> 9313.32s]  using it to blindfold myself. Make sure that they make that very clear. All right, let's go.
[9313.32s -> 9322.22s]  How much is my time limit? But I will say G4. Thanks for having me. That was really fun time.
[9322.22s -> 9330.30s]  Studio is really cool. All right. Okay. Am I in? All right, I'm going to go. Put it like five
[9330.30s -> 9353.86s]  minutes. There's no possible way I'm going to know where I am. Finding the paint is half this whole
[9353.86s -> 9392.95s]  thing. Is it not right here? I've no, I don't know where the paint is. I, I don't know. Can I reset?
[9392.95s -> 9410.81s]  Let me reset. Oh, I was right there. All right. Hold on. Let me reset and okay. Make sure I can't
[9410.81s -> 9413.93s]  see. All right. I'm ready. I know. I didn't know where I didn't know where to start. I'm with my
[9413.93s -> 9421.45s]  WASD. I don't know whether that is. All right, let's go. So straight over here, left, straight,
[9421.45s -> 9458.23s]  down. Do I have paint? All right. I heard that. I can't, it usually, it makes, it makes like a little,
[9458.23s -> 9493.26s]  uh, plop noise, doesn't it? When you touch it. Wait, I'm, where am I? I hear, I hear splashing.
[9493.26s -> 9501.43s]  Why did I just hear splashing? I think I'm next to the bucket, which means, oh, hold on. I heard
[9501.43s -> 9513.91s]  something. This is not, it's just impossible. If I had paint already on the brush and I could just
[9513.91s -> 9542.39s]  cycle through it or something. Am I too far away from the table? I think I'm too far away.
[9542.39s -> 9561.10s]  All right. I'm still on the ground. Why would I not be on the ground? I think I moved way too far.
[9561.10s -> 9598.22s]  I give up. I'm done. Use spray paint instead. Cheating. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to,
[9598.22s -> 9604.84s]  let's play multiverses. I will come back to this. We will do this. Uh, we'll do this on the next
[9604.84s -> 9611.45s]  stream. Maybe we'll do this. I like this double, the double feature shit keeps things interesting.
[9611.45s -> 9614.49s]  We'll do this in another game. We'll play this like a couple hours, two or three hours,
[9614.49s -> 9623.22s]  play something else two or three hours. I like, I actually enjoy doing that. So we'll come back to
[9623.22s -> 9630.71s]  this on the next stream. All right. So now I'm actually very excited to do what I'm about to do.
[9631.11s -> 9646.04s]  Because Gizmo is in the game. Yeah. This, this, this, this is sponsored stream, but it's awesome
[9646.04s -> 9652.50s]  though. And I'll tell you why. So I genuinely enjoy this game and Warner Brothers has essentially
[9652.50s -> 9657.06s]  reached out a few times. I've been like, Hey, do you want to like get sponsored again? I'm just
[9657.06s -> 9664.14s]  like, that's fucking, yeah, that's fucking cool. I played this game off screen. I genuinely enjoy
[9664.14s -> 9671.35s]  this game. Yeah. Well, uh, let me just set it up. We'll be right back. Give me like two seconds
[9671.35s -> 9673.43s]  and we'll come right back.
