[5.24s -> 15.18s]  Here we go. Oh man, that was not a good idea.
[15.18s -> 20.06s]  Hey, this is gonna take me like five minutes to do this.
[20.06s -> 24.62s]  No, actually I'm... timer. Let's see how long it takes me to clear this room
[24.62s -> 28.86s]  because I kind of have to because look at all the stuff you get.
[28.86s -> 34.54s]  This is ridiculous. This is gonna take me like 15 minutes to do this,
[34.54s -> 41.59s]  isn't it? I don't know. Alright, so here we are guys.
[41.59s -> 46.55s]  You want to talk about value of an item early? Oh my god.
[46.55s -> 50.87s]  If you get card against humanity and you have a room that is this big,
[50.87s -> 54.07s]  a big room like this, and you go in and you use it,
[54.07s -> 57.94s]  I don't even know how much money is on the ground here and how many
[57.94s -> 61.70s]  like spirit hearts and evil hearts. Like, let's find out.
[61.70s -> 65.14s]  Ready? Look at the timer too. I only used two bombs.
[65.14s -> 67.94s]  This took me like seven and a half minutes. Let's see. Ready? Look at the
[67.94s -> 71.72s]  counter. There's like dimes in here and stuff.
[71.72s -> 76.47s]  Like, I'm gonna break the game. Can you go past 99?
[76.47s -> 81.61s]  Because I'm going to. Like, really. Hey, what is going on everybody?
[81.61s -> 85.69s]  Jirba here with the Binding of Isaac Rebirth.
[85.69s -> 90.81s]  This is the reimagining and redoing of the Binding of Isaac.
[90.81s -> 95.05s]  It's now on Steam. I'm sure you've probably heard of this game by now.
[95.05s -> 100.01s]  It's pretty popular. It's become a somewhat cult phenomenon.
[100.01s -> 103.13s]  This game has been over the last couple of years with good reason.
[103.13s -> 106.49s]  Because it's fun, it's really interesting, and it has a lot of replayability. I
[106.49s -> 109.22s]  think I put somewhere around a hundred hours or two
[109.22s -> 113.61s]  hundred hours or so into the last Binding of Isaac game.
[113.61s -> 117.21s]  And this is not a sequel. So this is just the read.
[117.21s -> 121.59s]  Ooh, already right off the bat. We got a robo baby.
[121.59s -> 125.67s]  So I really don't think I need to explain what this game is.
[125.67s -> 130.17s]  Because a majority of us all know what it is. It's just a better version of the
[130.17s -> 133.29s]  Binding of Isaac. With a ton of extra stuff and a bunch
[133.29s -> 137.91s]  more content. And I'm playing as Sampson, who is an unlockable character.
[138.23s -> 141.03s]  I don't know if this was a good idea for me to do this or not because I'm
[141.03s -> 145.48s]  not particularly great with the low damage characters, but he gets this thing
[145.48s -> 148.44s]  called rage where the more you hit people, the more you go
[149.00s -> 152.01s]  and you see, for instance I'm getting hit already.
[152.01s -> 156.17s]  Jerma just talks and then just gets hit by enemies that are incredibly easy to
[156.17s -> 159.48s]  dodge. It's time to happen again. I told you.
[159.48s -> 163.98s]  Told you! Alright, but I'm going for a mom killer, I'm going for a heart
[163.98s -> 167.82s]  kill. And let's hope we can get that in this live session, because that's what
[167.82s -> 172.18s]  this is. I'm just recording the game. Maybe I'll
[172.18s -> 207.80s]  make a bunch of- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm
[207.80s -> 242.04s]  I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm
[242.04s -> 245.98s]  Actually, wait, hold on a second. Hold on. Just a second here
[246.68s -> 253.13s]  Just a second. I can't believe that fly was hitting me. I really can't believe it
[254.10s -> 257.84s]  Famine. All right, time to be quiet because Jerma can't talk and play games at the same time
[262.44s -> 267.47s]  This guy's not bad. He just spawns the flies and I've got technology, baby
[267.89s -> 274.25s]  So this should go fairly well and I have rage as you can see my character is getting even angrier at the situation at hand
[274.63s -> 276.25s]  So he does more damage
[276.25s -> 285.22s]  There we go. Okay things are back on track as they say and I got the bandage which if you remember from the last game
[285.34s -> 288.14s]  This is the super meat boy
[288.66s -> 297.53s]  Equivalent of it being bandage girl. So let's go. Mmm spiders spiders
[298.05s -> 301.22s]  Damn it when I play this game
[301.22s -> 305.79s]  I feel like I need to have a swear jar because when I'm not recording if that just happened right there
[305.79s -> 311.23s]  I would have been like fuck so I need to open up like a swear jar fund
[311.25s -> 319.97s]  Like donate it to charity or something. What's going on? What the fuck is happening right now? What is going on?
[320.21s -> 324.29s]  What the hell was that? He's so
[325.35s -> 334.45s]  All right, that was odd. Why did my game just speed up by like three times? Ooh, I will take that money
[334.45s -> 343.67s]  I really don't know what the hell was that. I'm gonna like watch that back and probably throw up
[346.31s -> 353.85s]  Don't get hit by the easiest enemy. Come on now secret room could be up there, but I'm not gonna do it
[353.85s -> 358.91s]  I don't want to see what else I potentially can do in these other rooms
[359.19s -> 366.82s]  Okay, I like how I can see how long this video is so far four minutes. All right, speed it up
[366.82s -> 370.46s]  Let's go. You gotta get to them. We gotta get a mom's heart in like ten minutes
[370.46s -> 372.33s]  It's not gonna happen
[372.33s -> 377.30s]  I do want to keep those guys locked in over on the right because I don't want to open that up
[377.38s -> 383.76s]  Because once that opens the other guy will run out and make my day very very bad. I don't want a bad day
[383.76s -> 390.78s]  I want a good day. Damn it. Can you can that go through rocks? No, I guess not. I
[392.19s -> 399.12s]  Guess not. Okay, you are now free. I have 99 bombs. What are you doing? Just blow them up
[399.38s -> 404.97s]  Did I like forget that I had 99 bombs and you know
[404.97s -> 406.97s]  I thought for a second because I was talking I thought that was
[407.21s -> 412.63s]  The blast damage one not the actual 99 bombs one, but that should get rid of all of them
[412.63s -> 422.68s]  It does. All right secret room hunt time. I'm gonna say it's right here. Nope. I was wrong. No, it must be down here
[422.68s -> 431.55s]  Oh, I don't know actually it's to happening again. What is going on?
[432.05s -> 442.32s]  Why is my cave doing that? Do I have like a some messed up item that's doing this? I have technology
[442.32s -> 447.54s]  I have the T or Samson rage the bombs and the
[448.38s -> 459.29s]  Bandage something's going on here. Something is aloof because I don't have an answer to that. Ah
[466.65s -> 470.11s]  I don't know how to stop this
[470.11s -> 474.44s]  I
[482.01s -> 483.53s]  Don't know what to do
[483.53s -> 490.47s]  You know what? I think is actually going on right now guys cuz I'm running the games running at 120 frames
[490.67s -> 492.39s]  It's now back down to 60
[492.39s -> 496.32s]  It is speeding my game up when my frames per second go up
[496.40s -> 505.41s]  What on earth that happening at random times during when I need to dodge some of these harder boss fights is
[505.67s -> 507.97s]  Is not gonna be good
[508.45s -> 510.37s]  It's not gonna be great
[510.37s -> 518.04s]  It actually might get me killed but whatever we're just going to let it just do that. I guess
[518.56s -> 528.23s]  We'll see if it happens again. I'm gonna assume it's gonna happen again. Cuz why wouldn't it? It's happened like four times now, damn it
[530.40s -> 533.76s]  I can't whistle fun fact guys. I don't know how to whistle
[534.24s -> 543.71s]  I've tried to learn many times and it just never has happened. What is this matchbook evil up? Okay
[544.99s -> 546.67s]  So from my understanding
[546.67s -> 553.68s]  The evil stat in this game is the more evil you have the more chance you're gonna spawn a devil room
[553.68s -> 558.09s]  I believe I think let me just take a sip of my iced coffee and then maybe that maybe I'll figure it out that way
[558.09s -> 564.34s]  Yeah, yeah, it's the more evil you have the devil rooms will spawn
[564.82s -> 569.75s]  More or something and I guess you can get evil points by doing evil things
[570.15s -> 576.05s]  Like if you blow up the beggar, I think that gives you evil points. These are just think I don't know
[576.43s -> 582.80s]  There's a whole lot of secrets in this game as all of us are aware and I don't know like
[584.00s -> 587.24s]  75,000 percent of them. I only know a few things. I don't have very much stuff unlocked
[587.24s -> 594.26s]  I have I think I've only beaten the game like three or four times and now we're in super fast super speed mode
[594.26s -> 600.71s]  And what do I want now? I'm gonna blow both these so I can get the key
[600.71s -> 609.05s]  I apologize if that's like off-putting maybe it's because I'm recording in 60 frames a second or something
[609.11s -> 613.61s]  Maybe you know what? I'm gonna hold on a second
[613.61s -> 620.58s]  I'm gonna try to like fix this 60 what happens if you record a 60 frames per second video on YouTube and then it goes
[620.58s -> 628.79s]  To 30 frames per second halfway through the video. Is that gonna like break? Is my like channel gonna explode? I have no idea
[628.79s -> 634.90s]  Hold on. I'll be right back. Okay, I think I figured it out. Yeah, I definitely figured it out
[634.90s -> 644.24s]  I think we're good now if it happens again, I'm not sure what to say about this. I hate spiders
[644.24s -> 652.16s]  I hate spiders. I don't want to waste this run though cuz these items aren't that bad having the bandage
[652.34s -> 654.69s]  And here's a little trick
[654.69s -> 658.73s]  Here's a little tip about the bandage that I haven't really been talking about I haven't really even been doing
[658.81s -> 661.41s]  It does a ton of damage if you touch people with it
[661.41s -> 667.44s]  I'm kind of been scared to do it in this run because I've been talking and trying to introduce the video and saying hello
[667.44s -> 671.10s]  And everything but if you can get close enough to somebody and touch them with the bandage
[671.10s -> 680.39s]  It is a ridiculous damage see if I can do it here without like instantly dying and now I'm not going that close to these
[680.39s -> 684.59s]  Guys forget that I'll do it on the next boss
[684.89s -> 694.94s]  Whatever the next boss is you will see the super bandage powers and I only have one bandage. It is very very good
[695.02s -> 697.78s]  What's in the chest? Oh?
[697.78s -> 703.14s]  Pills here great luck done. Here's another thing I've noticed about this game
[703.14s -> 709.91s]  I feel like pills I've gotten a lot of pills that are just awful and I know that cane from the last is anything
[709.91s -> 711.91s]  What is good? Come on hit somebody
[711.95s -> 715.90s]  Come on, you gotta do like the arcing of the bullets. There we go
[715.94s -> 719.19s]  But I feel like there's so many bad pills in the game
[719.97s -> 721.97s]  Maybe I'm just having bad luck, but I
[722.49s -> 727.73s]  Maybe like 40% of every pill I've taken has been even not has not been terrible
[727.73s -> 736.15s]  I'd say it's 60% has been bad. Oh, maybe even more than that double shot. I'm okay with that
[736.15s -> 745.36s]  I wish it worked for the familiar to be cool. How many coins do I have enough to justify opening the store?
[746.45s -> 753.88s]  Probably not but I have so many bombs that I'm not using I need to just blow up all the secret room potential areas
[754.02s -> 760.52s]  Okay, I got some keys so the video still should be in 60 FPS by the way
[760.52s -> 765.72s]  I'm pretty sure I figured out that problem. I figured it. I used my
[766.75s -> 775.98s]  Science and I figured it out. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, you're these enemies. I forgot open. No
[778.98s -> 787.26s]  And these guys don't stop shooting either which really stinks almost just got hit by that
[787.26s -> 796.67s]  That would have been embarrassing that would have been embarrassing wouldn't it have been so funny thing about 60 FPS
[796.73s -> 803.24s]  I like haven't even watched any 60 FPS videos cuz I have Firefox and it like doesn't work in Firefox yet
[803.24s -> 809.84s]  And I've just been like too lazy to open up like Internet Explorer talk about like a lazy bastard, huh?
[809.84s -> 817.04s]  Oh 60 FPS for you videos on YouTube. I bet that's cool looking but I just I don't know
[817.04s -> 823.52s]  I gotta reach my arm over and click on Internet Explorer or Chrome and that's just too much work for me
[823.78s -> 831.82s]  My hands gonna get tired, but I will look at it now. Is it on like iPad?
[831.82s -> 838.64s]  I've watched videos on the iPad like in my bed just chilling out and I don't know if I've noticed a difference
[839.20s -> 846.92s]  Maybe I've just been tired or is it's HD only right? Isn't that one of the stipulations of using it? It's only HD
[847.44s -> 850.06s]  Screw it. We're going in. I have eight keys who cares
[852.36s -> 854.60s]  We're gonna donate some we're gonna go to
[855.60s -> 864.12s]  Whatever I'm gonna go to 115 because I'm not gonna get the necessary coins to be able to get to that
[864.12s -> 870.47s]  Which is what I want and give me these pills. I don't even care. I fought it. Hooray
[874.72s -> 882.44s]  Let's go the dark one I don't think I've ever fought this no first time I think I've ever seen this guy
[882.76s -> 884.32s]  You know I do what he does
[884.32s -> 889.30s]  Actually, no, maybe I have seen this guy. We'll find out if I can know no absolutely
[889.30s -> 891.78s]  I definitely haven't seen this before because I can't see anything
[892.94s -> 904.26s]  This guy's this guy's new shit. Here comes the dark. I love this double shot
[904.66s -> 909.66s]  Hopefully I get something cool to add on to this because the different the amount of modifiers that they put in this game and look
[909.66s -> 914.34s]  At that stupid item that's in the store came over here. I don't want mom's coin purse
[914.54s -> 921.06s]  It's a bunch of like garbage pills that I don't need won't but whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought that was the same one
[921.50s -> 931.97s]  Thought that was the same pill. All right, come on. I've had all bad ones. Give me a good one. There we go. Okay. Hmm
[932.51s -> 934.75s]  Super secret room. I don't know. I
[934.87s -> 938.35s]  Forget the criteria of soup. It's been a long time since I played Isaac
[938.55s -> 944.84s]  Isn't the super secret room has to be connected to one room or something like that or one door?
[945.08s -> 951.62s]  We're just gonna go with regular secret rooms for now. I'm not gonna get that coin. It'll kill me
[952.14s -> 960.12s]  We'll just kill me. That's right. I'm done. What do we got the time? Oh 14 minutes
[960.28s -> 966.22s]  This video is gonna be like an hour and 15 minutes long. Fuck it. Let's just go in
[967.94s -> 969.22s]  Hmm
[969.22s -> 972.12s]  Well, I don't have a space bar item
[972.16s -> 978.26s]  So I'm gonna use one and just use it right there because it only takes one room to recharge anyways
[978.58s -> 983.58s]  Which is another thing I'm happy that they did and damn it. I got stuck on the thing up down there
[983.94s -> 991.22s]  The recharging of items is a lot more clear in this game. It's actually just the number of rooms you have to clear
[991.22s -> 993.30s]  So on the top left, I just have one bar there
[993.30s -> 997.73s]  that means one room needs to be cleared and of course depending on if you have any of the
[997.95s -> 1002.54s]  Like the battery or like the 9 volts and stuff to be able to reduce your charge rate
[1002.54s -> 1007.20s]  I'm sure that affects it as well. This guy's giving me a real pain in the ass
[1007.68s -> 1015.76s]  Faith up Bible tract. I don't know what this does. I'm pretty sure this just is faith up
[1015.76s -> 1024.16s]  So that means I have a better chance at finding angel rooms. I still don't know the petrified poo is just lucky
[1024.16s -> 1025.08s]  It is more lucky
[1025.08s -> 1030.31s]  I don't know feel free to scream at me in the comments of what I just did was stupid and left out there
[1030.31s -> 1033.88s]  Oh dear. Oh boy. Oh boy
[1035.68s -> 1038.30s]  double mega tears
[1039.30s -> 1050.79s]  That's so cool. All right, let's continue. He's doing a lot of damage. I forgot to show you the bandage thing
[1050.79s -> 1060.52s]  Oh, I'll do that. This is what I do. I just forget things to the right
[1061.44s -> 1067.04s]  Secret room actually might be right here. I'm gonna assume it could be right. Hooray
[1067.56s -> 1075.82s]  Just a regular chest got the bomb back and a coin. Okay, sure thing
[1075.82s -> 1081.96s]  I'm gonna go in here too because that requires two keys to open. I don't want this. I don't want this
[1081.96s -> 1087.20s]  I'm pretty sure this is going. No, I don't want that the dice room that one dice. I
[1088.29s -> 1092.45s]  It every time I've done that it is randomized every item that I currently have
[1092.65s -> 1098.41s]  So I don't want to do it because I like this setup. This is actually pretty good right now. There's a lot of damage
[1098.93s -> 1103.82s]  And it could it can only get better from here if I get like tears up or something
[1104.02s -> 1105.82s]  So I'm gonna let it be
[1105.82s -> 1116.44s]  Let's go. I have enough bombs to get it might as well go get it, right? Let's let's be go-getters a heart
[1116.50s -> 1125.25s]  Yeah, was not worth it. I don't want to die from that open
[1126.29s -> 1133.90s]  These enemies are so annoying because you have to wait till they walk at you and open that guy
[1133.90s -> 1139.22s]  I wonder how much damage I'm actually doing actually the gurdy will be a really good showcase of the bandage
[1139.60s -> 1145.29s]  So so ready I'll show it to you once I can clear this stuff out. All right, watch this ready check out the bandage
[1145.69s -> 1151.78s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'll get it. I don't I get the hitbox
[1151.78s -> 1157.92s]  So this is kind of weird. I need to get to a place where like right look at that. See I didn't touch him
[1158.12s -> 1161.00s]  That's just the bandage doing that. All right
[1161.00s -> 1165.16s]  I took enough damage for you to see that so if you're like good at the game and you can't like you can avoid damage
[1165.48s -> 1167.53s]  That is a huge deal
[1167.53s -> 1174.68s]  I just took like seven points of damage to show that to you and a lot of you probably already knew that was a
[1174.68s -> 1188.49s]  Good thing. So whoops devil room. Did you just teleport me to the same room? Okay, good and two troll bombs
[1189.15s -> 1195.74s]  I got what I needed out of there anything else I could go down, you know, let's screw it. We're gonna go down
[1195.74s -> 1205.53s]  We're gonna be completionists. I'm not technically but sort of what's down there. What have I not seen could just be a regular room
[1205.53s -> 1219.14s]  I don't want to die cuz seriously Samson. I'm building up such a ridiculous damage. Holy shit. I'm one hitting every enemy
[1219.14s -> 1230.59s]  I don't know what this is. What is this? I'm scared to get don't you even think about it fire. I'm scared cursed
[1231.42s -> 1244.17s]  Guppies tail. I don't know what that does. I don't know. I could just go like Wikipedia this right now, but what's the fun in that?
[1244.17s -> 1246.81s]  I want to find out I want to have it be a surprise
[1247.21s -> 1254.80s]  Okay, let's go already wasted enough time in the first like two or three areas
[1254.80s -> 1263.66s]  Let's just keep going up up and away and into the next tier of dungeons
[1263.98s -> 1272.14s]  Where are we the depths level one? Welcome young Samson
[1275.32s -> 1279.08s]  Technology baby can shoot through those so we are perfect. Oh
[1281.11s -> 1293.81s]  Come on get him you weakling use your super techno powers and shoot his face off. Good. Good job missing page
[1300.96s -> 1305.12s]  Mmm, I don't know the thing with the trinkets is I can always forget what the trinkets do
[1305.32s -> 1312.16s]  What's gonna shit all the trinkets and relics and stuff? I just never remember what they are
[1312.16s -> 1316.32s]  I could have like the stupidest worst drink at that in the game and I would I don't even know it
[1316.58s -> 1325.19s]  There's somebody in the comments right now probably like and I can't even I can't hear you. I can't hear you
[1325.19s -> 1336.49s]  You have to scream louder. I can't hear you. There you go. Now I can hear you but this run looks like it's gonna be pretty good
[1338.06s -> 1350.97s]  Considering I want this I want Bob's rotten head so I can go like this now
[1350.97s -> 1353.57s]  I have to wait three rooms for the charge again. That was not worth it
[1353.57s -> 1361.37s]  I should just be dropping bombs everywhere. Really just put them all over the place. There's no reason not to I have a million of them
[1361.63s -> 1369.18s]  Getting confused by these skulls open you fucker
[1371.20s -> 1373.83s]  You
[1373.83s -> 1377.07s]  Okay, be I need to be careful cuz I have a tendency
[1377.07s -> 1383.31s]  I'm one of those people when I play Isaac to totally lose total control and it all falls apart
[1383.55s -> 1388.23s]  It happens to me quite frequently. I'll have a cool build. I'll have something going on
[1388.23s -> 1389.45s]  I'll be like, oh, she's going good
[1389.45s -> 1395.15s]  And then I'll take like a couple points of damage in the same room and then it all falls apart and I die like in
[1395.15s -> 1400.27s]  The next room and I don't want that to happen because I'm recording this and I don't want to get embarrassed
[1400.43s -> 1406.04s]  What do you think? Should I wait for the item? Actually? I know I already
[1407.54s -> 1411.86s]  Wait, it might be a better use of these. Holy shit. This room has a lot of people in it
[1411.86s -> 1416.26s]  There could be better use of that key and there is already good thing
[1416.26s -> 1424.71s]  I didn't do it because that would have been kind of a waste kind of excuse me
[1425.15s -> 1437.61s]  Don't step on the goo on the ground and you're done too. All right, let's get another item a lot of actives
[1437.61s -> 1443.84s]  I've been not getting anything to help this build out with the double huge super shot
[1443.94s -> 1450.19s]  But this is very good too. You put a coin in and it like it does all your damage pretty much
[1450.19s -> 1459.14s]  It shakes the screen hits everybody in the room for one coin like this ready point just did it. Okay. Yeah
[1459.66s -> 1467.56s]  If I lose there's no way I lose I can clear every room no matter what watch this. I'm gonna open this door
[1467.56s -> 1473.37s]  Oh, you're all dead. Bye. See ya. Thanks. Thanks for the coin
[1477.82s -> 1482.13s]  Okay, I wish I knew what this stuff does I need to play more Isaac
[1482.13s -> 1489.71s]  So I know what things do and there's something up here to now. I'm leaving that there. That's absolutely staying there
[1489.75s -> 1497.97s]  we're gonna leave these I am also not going to use the
[1498.43s -> 1504.78s]  Store room anymore because I want to keep these coins so I can clear whole rooms in one second
[1504.78s -> 1513.13s]  That would be good to do. I think I'll open it. Come on. Give me another give my key back
[1513.19s -> 1520.65s]  Nice and that's what we call value right there. That is total value. I want to save my keys
[1520.65s -> 1524.77s]  I'm not forget the item room. Hold on to my keys and let's just keep going
[1526.64s -> 1531.07s]  It's always those little turkey guys that screw me up
[1531.07s -> 1537.95s]  I know what this does this I believe if you take damage is a chance to turn you into Pac-Man
[1538.19s -> 1545.11s]  So you better believe I'm holding on to it. Okay, how bad it is. I mean you've got to mention Pac-Man
[1546.60s -> 1555.67s]  Keeping it dude. They're gonna trash this item never I will never trash it. I'll both secret room
[1555.79s -> 1566.18s]  Could be right here. It probably is right here. No, so where is it down here? Whoa. Whoa
[1567.26s -> 1578.24s]  Forget it. No, I need that secret room because the amount of coins I have is very very big deal very important
[1578.24s -> 1582.56s]  So I have to open it like a please tell me I'm gonna hit it if I open it right here
[1583.88s -> 1588.16s]  Shit, we'll have plenty of bombs. Maybe I let it if I do it like that shit
[1588.32s -> 1594.31s]  What if I do two bombs damn it fuck? All right, so it's obviously not right there
[1594.31s -> 1600.40s]  So that means it must be over here. So you should blow these up too because there's stuff in these
[1602.06s -> 1604.84s]  There's one right there. That is a
[1605.40s -> 1610.76s]  Evil heart which if you don't know what these things do when that heart is consumed
[1610.76s -> 1616.18s]  It's the same thing as a spirit heart. It will do damage to everything in the whole room. There it is
[1616.18s -> 1621.88s]  And it's two keys which means I'm probably gonna go
[1623.13s -> 1627.61s]  Open those chests or at least one of them because then I have an extra key or maybe I'll just open the door
[1627.61s -> 1635.01s]  I don't know as a beauty of Isaac you could it there's so many different options like which one do I do?
[1635.01s -> 1640.59s]  Which do I pick do I open? Yeah, we'll just open in this and we're gonna go in here
[1640.59s -> 1646.94s]  I'm gonna attack the boss lots of items. I wonder let's see what happens if I do this not worth it
[1646.94s -> 1650.36s]  It's not doing that much damage. I'm doing so much damage with these tears anyway
[1650.36s -> 1659.20s]  So not worth doing the active item in this room at least and spray jump down here
[1659.72s -> 1666.60s]  And do the spray again. No, you're gonna jump. Yeah, I think you only spray from to the side. Yeah, no, maybe probably
[1666.62s -> 1672.18s]  But it doesn't matter you did. What am I gonna get? What am I gonna get? Oh boy
[1673.83s -> 1680.18s]  Damage up and I've cute actually cue the fool. Let's do it
[1680.18s -> 1684.87s]  I was kind of hoping it was gonna teleport me into the item room
[1685.01s -> 1690.57s]  Just because I wouldn't have to spend a key to get in there and there might be something in there that I want
[1690.61s -> 1694.74s]  But nope
[1694.74s -> 1700.42s]  No, one of these times I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna walk over it and get hurt and you're gonna hear me scream
[1700.54s -> 1709.62s]  Okay, let's go in. This is the part at this point. This is where mom is
[1712.01s -> 1720.42s]  So I wonder if we're going to do goodbye whole room then I wasn't even gonna think to deal with that room
[1720.42s -> 1731.76s]  No way can forget that room 48-hour energy just gives you a battery. No, we're not dealing with this room either
[1734.08s -> 1740.12s]  All right, do I try to get some coins let's I'm gonna bring this down to ten, okay
[1740.12s -> 1746.52s]  Give me this coin. Come on. I need this you fuck and now we're just gonna take out the whole room
[1746.66s -> 1753.77s]  Didn't get my coins, but I will get probably one or two here. No, I didn't even mean to pick that up shit cuz I need
[1754.67s -> 1764.13s]  Well, that's not cool. I really didn't want to pick that up, but I did cuz I'm a klutz. Hey look another room
[1764.13s -> 1769.58s]  I don't want to deal with okay, so we won't deal with it. Do you see how awesome this item really is?
[1769.82s -> 1774.06s]  It's just you pay one coin to destroy everything
[1774.32s -> 1776.50s]  Don't think I need to do it here
[1776.50s -> 1781.62s]  And plus I'm gonna hold on to that for the womb because there are some really awful rooms in the room
[1781.84s -> 1785.12s]  So from now on conserve my financials
[1787.74s -> 1793.54s]  conserve actually still might be able to get the benefit from the heaven heart or the
[1793.98s -> 1800.74s]  Good heart would be want to call it smart fly revenge fly. I believe if I take damage this thing goes after
[1801.62s -> 1804.31s]  Enemies in the room. So pretty cool
[1805.23s -> 1820.61s]  Don't want to do that yet. We've got more stuff to explore like this room with the bone people get out of here
[1820.61s -> 1827.18s]  You bone people somebody bombs. I just don't know what to do with them all
[1827.28s -> 1835.94s]  I wish I could trade the technology baby for something because he's kind of I mean he's doing a little bit of work
[1835.94s -> 1844.72s]  But not even close to the amount of work that that massage machine is doing. You know, we're gonna hold the coins
[1844.96s -> 1863.80s]  No reason to do it. Mmm secret room. I wonder maybe down here. Maybe no, maybe down here
[1863.92s -> 1868.22s]  Another one of these trolley type rooms
[1870.16s -> 1879.40s]  Excuse me. This guy's still doing standing here. Come on. Give me a chance to shoot you not fair. Well
[1879.74s -> 1885.58s]  I'm not entirely sure maybe if I go in the item
[1885.58s -> 1890.05s]  No, I don't check this I already did check that didn't I yeah, and it wasn't there
[1890.05s -> 1900.35s]  So it must be somewhere down here. Watch out and I don't think so. No
[1903.05s -> 1906.31s]  mmm up here
[1906.51s -> 1912.34s]  Spending a lot of time trying to find this secret room when I should just I should just go to mom greed
[1912.50s -> 1919.82s]  This is amazing. By the way guys just realized how awesome it was for me to find greed right there
[1919.82s -> 1923.97s]  Cuz look at all these coins. I have no look at the amount of times. I'm gonna be able to you
[1923.97s -> 1930.87s]  Oh boy, I'm just gonna walk in and just totally roll rooms in the womb. No one's gonna even hurt me
[1932.30s -> 1939.33s]  Nobody will hurt me once in the womb. That's a bold statement to make but what is going on here?
[1939.57s -> 1947.04s]  These are the guys that disappear right they have stealth and another heart. I'm just gonna pick it up because it doesn't matter
[1947.04s -> 1952.96s]  I already gonna get a completed one. Okay time to go
[1952.96s -> 1959.92s]  I have a ton of confidence in this run a ton. Can you hear it in my voice?
[1960.02s -> 1970.15s]  I mean we're talking we're talking 60 frames per second. We're talking 60 FPS here guys. That's how much confidence I have
[1970.15s -> 1981.55s]  I'm uploading in 60 frames a second. Here's mom. Hello mother. Whoa, everything's like blue
[1981.55s -> 1986.27s]  Oh, I'm pac-man. Oh, yeah. Oh my god. Look at pac-man's doing so good
[1986.79s -> 1998.70s]  That run was just saved by pac-man. There it is. Please give me coins ace of spades
[1999.14s -> 2007.62s]  No, no, nobody's gonna give me coins. I'm gonna keep pac-man cuz this kind of is like an oh shit button
[2008.17s -> 2016.88s]  Even though I don't activate it. It's still it's just like oh shit. It's okay. You're pac-man. Here we go. Here we go
[2016.96s -> 2024.20s]  We are now entering the womb and I didn't pick up cue the fool again, which is dumb, but watch this guys
[2024.20s -> 2031.58s]  Oh, hey, haha. What? Oh, it's cuz they're not the heads are not okay. This is wasted two coins. That was really stupid
[2031.58s -> 2035.30s]  I didn't even need to use them. I just got scared
[2036.90s -> 2046.17s]  Hello room. Goodbye room. I said I wasn't gonna wasn't gonna take damage in this womb
[2046.17s -> 2048.31s]  Well, it almost just wasn't true. Goodbye
[2051.22s -> 2059.80s]  Hey, look look at me. Hi. Oh, wow. Those guys had a lot of help. Oh, look a room full of shit
[2059.80s -> 2066.31s]  No, not anymore. This is amazing. This item is so good
[2071.44s -> 2079.95s]  It's so good. Oh, why is my game lagging? I'm lagging. No, not at this time
[2079.95s -> 2088.84s]  This is I'm doing such a great run. I hope my computer doesn't crash man. Goodbye
[2089.26s -> 2094.88s]  Let's just let's just go screw it right? I mean, why not just screw it? Let's just go
[2094.88s -> 2097.32s]  We're gonna beat the game like in the next five minutes
[2097.32s -> 2107.01s]  I don't even have any tears up or anything, but I'm gonna just blow through this. Yeah
[2107.01s -> 2118.64s]  My only concern is when we get to the heart and there's a devil room. I wonder what's in there a couple of keys. Oh
[2121.84s -> 2126.83s]  Is that ah, I don't you know what?
[2126.83s -> 2129.91s]  I'm not gonna risk it cuz I forget I know this is a familiar
[2130.05s -> 2134.11s]  But I don't know what this is and frankly right now the familiars
[2134.11s -> 2138.27s]  I don't even care about the familiars because my tears do so much damage and I have the massage machine thing
[2138.51s -> 2143.41s]  So I don't think it matters. I'm not gonna waste a heart where it's not necessarily when it's not necessarily
[2144.01s -> 2150.43s]  Let's go speed run you what you guys want to talk about a speed run
[2150.43s -> 2161.10s]  I mean, come on speed run right now that got 32 minutes. We're talking about a speed run lust and you are gone
[2161.30s -> 2169.10s]  Don't know what this does. Are you a wizard? No, I'm not but this only lasts
[2169.10s -> 2178.54s]  I believe like a minute or so or a room or two. So I'm okay with this actually. I hope it wears off
[2178.54s -> 2186.22s]  You know what? I don't I don't I don't thank goodness you blocked that fly or maybe it was the bandage
[2186.40s -> 2201.18s]  Guys taking a lot of damage geez. Oh, that's cuz he's like a mini boss finally at war off right when we get to the boss
[2201.18s -> 2205.81s]  I'm going right in guys. I'm not wasting any time because I might be able to get this to
[2205.91s -> 2207.54s]  To
[2207.54s -> 2217.08s]  One of the harder places which would be cool. See you later. And we also another damage up. Holy shit
[2217.08s -> 2224.94s]  I'm I must be at man. I'm at max damage. There's no way I wouldn't be I love how you can just do that
[2224.98s -> 2233.31s]  Hey, you ever play like the game binding of Isaac before it just press the space bar with coins with the damage up items
[2234.03s -> 2245.28s]  You win the game. Whoa, that didn't happen instantly. I thought they were all gonna die got my coins up again, which is good
[2245.50s -> 2257.61s]  Don't even want to deal with you don't want to deal with you don't want to deal with this room either
[2257.61s -> 2265.06s]  So yeah, but I do want this chest. I would be singing a totally different tune guys if
[2266.10s -> 2275.03s]  Yeah, I don't want screw that I would be singing a completely different tune if I didn't have this item and look at all these
[2275.95s -> 2282.41s]  These coins they want me to win. They want me to win this
[2284.74s -> 2291.88s]  They I the binding of Isaac gods have determined that I'm going to win that's what they've decided today
[2292.12s -> 2299.75s]  We're just gonna go. Let's go mom's heart. Oh, hey, look guys like I'm playing the game
[2306.12s -> 2309.89s]  No, we don't have an opportunity to go to
[2311.43s -> 2313.67s]  one of the other places like heaven or
[2314.35s -> 2321.68s]  Or the chest or whatever or shull shale shull. How is it pronounced? Well, yeah, that that's uh, what is it? 35 minutes?
[2321.68s -> 2325.68s]  That's not that bad. I'm not bad for a beginner
