[1.34s -> 3.34s]  Just open up the first one instead.
[3.34s -> 5.34s]  You want to just play the first one?
[5.34s -> 7.96s]  Let's open up the first one. I like that one.
[7.96s -> 27.35s]  Relaxing stream.
[27.35s -> 29.35s]  I got a meeting in like an hour and ten minutes.
[29.35s -> 39.59s]  I went backwards.
[39.59s -> 41.59s]  I've depreciated.
[41.59s -> 48.31s]  Remember this one? Remember this game?
[48.31s -> 50.68s]  I gotta change the stream title.
[50.68s -> 56.50s]  So what the fuck are they gonna add in the third game?
[56.50s -> 61.83s]  Is it gonna come with a cook serve delicious eye patch that you have to wear?
[61.83s -> 73.42s]  Is the game mirrored? Do I have to like hold a mirror up behind me and play it?
[73.42s -> 78.02s]  Third game's a food truck.
[78.02s -> 80.02s]  That's actually pretty cool. Alright, let's go.
[80.02s -> 82.58s]  I know it. Okay, look at this one.
[82.58s -> 85.78s]  Day 15.
[85.78s -> 87.78s]  We're gonna go day 4. Yeah.
[87.78s -> 89.78s]  Because I'm not ready.
[89.78s -> 92.66s]  I'm gonna embarrass myself again, I think.
[92.66s -> 95.03s]  Career menu, let's go.
[95.03s -> 97.03s]  We got patch notes. Alright, cool.
[97.03s -> 102.92s]  Start new day.
[102.92s -> 114.25s]  I need to know if I still have it in me.
[114.25s -> 124.87s]  Nice.
[124.87s -> 136.33s]  You nailed it.
[136.33s -> 143.11s]  You lost 2,000 viewers. No, I didn't.
[143.11s -> 147.85s]  That would be so...
[147.85s -> 149.85s]  That would be so sad if I did.
[149.85s -> 154.39s]  I would be sad.
[154.39s -> 158.39s]  I'd be like, oh fuck, I couldn't do cook serve delicious and everybody left.
[158.39s -> 160.57s]  I couldn't play this second game.
[160.57s -> 164.28s]  Oh, you said no salt, right?
[164.28s -> 170.04s]  This is fried chicken.
[170.04s -> 181.54s]  Got it.
[181.54s -> 183.54s]  This is the kind of rush hour I'm talking about.
[183.54s -> 185.54s]  Cook serve delicious 2 is this one with mods.
[185.54s -> 201.53s]  Ah.
[201.53s -> 203.53s]  This is casual. Yeah, this is relaxing though, isn't it?
[203.53s -> 205.53s]  That's what I wanted.
[205.53s -> 216.60s]  I quit the second one because it was too hard for me.
[216.60s -> 218.60s]  But I am playing this one and I like this one.
[218.60s -> 220.60s]  You're never gonna make it in the McDonald's industry.
[220.60s -> 228.15s]  I don't need to.
[228.15s -> 230.15s]  Make it in my own chicken industry.
[230.15s -> 232.90s]  Come on.
[232.90s -> 240.63s]  With salt.
[240.63s -> 251.30s]  Warm up with the first one then move on to the second one.
[251.30s -> 253.30s]  No, I can't do it.
[253.30s -> 255.30s]  You know what's funny?
[255.30s -> 262.02s]  The second that I realized that I was gonna have to like hold buttons and press all the buttons at the same time.
[262.02s -> 264.02s]  I was like, well, this is the streams end.
[264.02s -> 266.52s]  This is over.
[266.52s -> 268.52s]  I didn't want to say it.
[268.52s -> 270.52s]  I knew it.
[270.52s -> 273.34s]  I knew it.
[273.34s -> 275.96s]  I can't. I knew it.
[275.96s -> 278.71s]  Shift tab and then hold
[278.71s -> 280.71s]  left trigger and press like.
[280.71s -> 291.72s]  Nope. I pressed S.
[291.72s -> 295.62s]  You played it for less than 10 minutes.
[295.62s -> 299.46s]  Yeah, and I wanted
[299.46s -> 301.46s]  just to relax today.
[301.46s -> 303.46s]  Just chill and draw pictures
[303.46s -> 317.67s]  of cartoons and stuff.
[317.67s -> 319.67s]  Play it again sometime. Maybe I'll try it again.
[319.67s -> 321.67s]  I don't know. I just like.
[321.67s -> 323.67s]  And I know it's not the game's fault. That's the thing.
[323.67s -> 337.99s]  It's me. No me.
[337.99s -> 342.02s]  That was some straight up Neo treatment.
[342.02s -> 348.04s]  Yeah, but I didn't like.
[348.04s -> 350.04s]  I can tell you that I didn't like Neo.
[350.04s -> 366.66s]  Uh oh. Here we go.
[366.66s -> 368.66s]  Uh oh. I was supposed to hit three. Come on.
[368.66s -> 370.66s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[370.66s -> 384.41s]  Oh, shit. Alright, we're good.
[384.41s -> 399.30s]  Shit. I missed it.
[399.30s -> 402.38s]  I missed it twice in a row.
[402.38s -> 404.38s]  You should play Tapper. Is that the beer game?
[404.38s -> 414.04s]  I'm ahead on that beer.
[414.04s -> 419.42s]  Am I losing my mind?
[419.42s -> 421.42s]  Or is this day going on
[421.42s -> 423.66s]  an extreme
[423.66s -> 425.66s]  amount of time? Why is this so long?
[425.66s -> 427.66s]  Am I missing something here?
[427.66s -> 432.84s]  Why is this going on for so long?
[432.84s -> 441.42s]  Is it just a slower game?
[441.42s -> 444.36s]  Or is this endless mode?
[444.36s -> 456.33s]  Give a picture. Thumbs up.
[456.33s -> 459.27s]  Alright, I'm going to switch to day 15 after this
[459.27s -> 461.27s]  because that's the way we were last time, I think.
[461.27s -> 465.75s]  I think I just need to warm up.
[465.75s -> 467.75s]  In fact, yeah. Get me out of here. I quit.
[467.75s -> 482.39s]  There it is. Select a character.
[482.39s -> 484.39s]  What? I don't remember any of this.
[484.39s -> 486.39s]  Welcome to Battle Kitchen?
[486.39s -> 491.19s]  No. There we go.
[491.19s -> 495.48s]  Alright. So the last time I played this,
[495.48s -> 500.54s]  this is where we left off. Burgers are now
[500.54s -> 502.71s]  available. Menu rot.
[502.71s -> 504.71s]  I got to take that shit off the menu. Safety inspection.
[504.71s -> 506.71s]  It's time for your five day safety inspection.
[506.71s -> 508.71s]  Inspector will come to your restaurant a few times today.
[508.71s -> 511.78s]  How quickly I do chores.
[511.78s -> 514.22s]  Alright, that's good to know.
[514.22s -> 517.29s]  What do I have for foods right now?
[517.29s -> 520.04s]  Good shit. Here's my menu. There's rot
[520.04s -> 522.47s]  here. Rotten.
[522.47s -> 524.47s]  Disgusting. It's fucking rotten.
[524.47s -> 529.38s]  Let's put the steak.
[529.38s -> 531.75s]  The trout. Lasagna.
[531.75s -> 533.75s]  Ooh, this might be bad.
[533.75s -> 539.45s]  I don't know about that.
[539.45s -> 541.45s]  I said the word lasagna and everyone's saying disgusting.
[541.45s -> 544.26s]  I agree. Okay, that's fine.
[544.26s -> 547.14s]  What do I have for money? No.
[547.14s -> 554.70s]  Let's go. I'm kidding. Lasagna's
[554.70s -> 557.26s]  not disgusting. Hello?
[557.26s -> 563.51s]  What's going on? One.
[563.51s -> 566.71s]  One. Hey!
[566.71s -> 577.51s]  Hey! What is going on?
[577.51s -> 591.26s]  Begin. What happened?
[591.26s -> 593.26s]  Okay, something's wrong. The game, like, is broken.
[593.26s -> 603.16s]  Uh, is num
[603.16s -> 605.98s]  numlock?
[605.98s -> 609.11s]  Is it recognizing the...
[609.11s -> 611.29s]  Okay, unplug the controller.
[611.29s -> 617.43s]  Press alt.
[617.43s -> 625.43s]  I need to restart the game.
[625.43s -> 635.02s]  Well, that sucks.
[635.02s -> 637.02s]  I mean, I'm still relaxed. Everything's fine.
[637.02s -> 639.02s]  What time is it? I got my meeting.
[639.02s -> 641.02s]  I've got my meeting in, like, 45 minutes.
[641.02s -> 643.51s]  An hour. It's an important meeting.
[643.51s -> 651.70s]  Munkas.
[651.70s -> 653.70s]  Why are you munkasing that?
[653.70s -> 660.36s]  Okay, here we go. Day 15.
[660.36s -> 665.35s]  Career menu.
[665.35s -> 668.36s]  View your active menu. This is...
[668.36s -> 670.36s]  That's fine.
[670.36s -> 679.51s]  Start the new day. There we go.
[679.51s -> 682.52s]  Game glitched. It's all good.
[682.52s -> 685.72s]  Don't play a bad game and
[685.72s -> 687.72s]  do a comb stream for an hour.
[687.72s -> 691.05s]  This is not a bad game.
[691.05s -> 693.93s]  Season three times in one juice.
[693.93s -> 702.50s]  For a second I thought the
[702.50s -> 704.50s]  kitchen exploded. I don't know why. I just heard the...
[704.50s -> 706.50s]  Okay, layer ingredients above.
[706.50s -> 708.50s]  Pasta, sauce, cheese, parmesan.
[708.50s -> 710.68s]  Oh, right.
[710.68s -> 718.22s]  And then this is ready?
[718.22s -> 722.25s]  A medium grape with ice, please.
[722.25s -> 724.81s]  With ice. A medium. I need a medium grape with ice.
[724.81s -> 726.81s]  Oh, ah!
[726.81s -> 728.81s]  Ah!
[728.81s -> 730.81s]  Where? Did I do it? Okay.
[730.81s -> 745.06s]  Uh...
[745.06s -> 747.06s]  I can't watch this stream. It's making me too hungry.
[747.06s -> 752.12s]  Large.
[752.12s -> 754.12s]  With no ice. Large cold with no ice. You got it.
[754.12s -> 756.12s]  Steak. Season once.
[756.12s -> 758.12s]  Twice juicy.
[758.12s -> 760.12s]  And a little bit of citrus.
[760.12s -> 762.36s]  And fillet the fish.
[762.36s -> 764.36s]  And then season it up. Cook it up.
[764.36s -> 766.36s]  What do we got? I want a small diet with ice, please.
[766.36s -> 768.36s]  How do I get ice? Ice. Small diet with ice, please.
[768.36s -> 770.36s]  Small diet with ice, please.
[770.36s -> 772.36s]  Four. Parmesan.
[772.36s -> 774.36s]  Pasta, sauce, meat, cheese, parmesan.
[774.36s -> 777.56s]  I don't know.
[777.56s -> 780.82s]  A small tea with ice, please.
[780.82s -> 791.13s]  Medium diet with ice, please.
[791.13s -> 797.66s]  Four. We got large cold with ice.
[797.66s -> 799.66s]  No ice, please.
[799.66s -> 802.92s]  Okay. Pasta, sauce, meat, cheese.
[802.92s -> 804.92s]  Pasta, sauce, meat, cheese.
[804.92s -> 811.32s]  Right?
[811.32s -> 821.18s]  I don't know. I did it fast.
[821.18s -> 823.80s]  See? Oh, you idiot.
[823.80s -> 830.46s]  Nice meat soup.
[830.46s -> 834.10s]  You have to go faster.
[834.10s -> 836.10s]  Pasta, sauce, meat, cheese, parmesan.
[836.10s -> 838.10s]  P. S. M.
[838.10s -> 840.10s]  P. S. M. S.
[840.10s -> 842.10s]  P. S. M. S.
[842.10s -> 844.73s]  I can't.
[844.73s -> 846.73s]  I can't. I'm not capable.
[846.73s -> 849.61s]  I'm incapable.
[849.61s -> 855.43s]  P. S. M. C. P.
[855.43s -> 858.06s]  I have to look at my fucking hands.
[858.06s -> 860.74s]  P. S. M. C. R.
[860.74s -> 862.74s]  P. S. M. C. R.
[862.74s -> 864.74s]  P. S. M. C. R.
[864.74s -> 883.69s]  You gotta play something relaxing.
[883.69s -> 893.93s]  I'm good. I'm good. Don't worry.
[893.93s -> 895.93s]  P. S. What was it?
[895.93s -> 898.81s]  P. S. M. C. R.
[898.81s -> 904.44s]  I don't know if that was correct.
[904.44s -> 919.59s]  That was right.
[919.59s -> 921.59s]  He's just sitting here sweating in a suit and playing a baby game
[921.59s -> 923.59s]  while stressing about his important
[923.59s -> 926.73s]  meeting.
[926.73s -> 928.73s]  I don't own a three piece suit.
[928.73s -> 931.99s]  Season one's twice juicy.
[931.99s -> 937.75s]  Season one's twice juicy.
[937.75s -> 940.57s]  P. S. M. C. R.
[940.57s -> 952.02s]  Large. Oops.
[952.02s -> 954.02s]  Throw it away. How do I throw it away?
[954.02s -> 965.61s]  Whatever.
[965.61s -> 967.61s]  Season three times and one juicy.
[967.61s -> 969.61s]  P. S. P. S. M.
[969.61s -> 971.61s]  P. S. I. P. S.
[971.61s -> 973.61s]  P. S. C. R.
[973.61s -> 978.65s]  Oh! P. S.
[978.65s -> 988.89s]  Didn't fuck it up.
[988.89s -> 998.23s]  Oh. P. C. P. S. C. D. D. D.
[998.23s -> 1000.23s]  Down. It's P. S. C. C. D. D. M. M.
[1000.23s -> 1004.84s]  The speed run of this is really fast.
[1004.84s -> 1010.54s]  That's actually pretty interesting to look at I think.
[1010.54s -> 1014.76s]  Okay. Chores.
[1014.76s -> 1019.18s]  The second a chore comes up, do a quick
[1019.18s -> 1035.03s]  two three. Why do you flush it
[1035.03s -> 1037.03s]  and sanitize the toilet? I don't know.
[1037.03s -> 1039.98s]  Why flush the toilet at all? It's a waste of water.
[1039.98s -> 1042.15s]  P. S.
[1042.15s -> 1048.10s]  Just fill it up for like weeks and then
[1048.10s -> 1050.10s]  flush it. That's disgusting.
[1061.75s -> 1074.30s]  Flush it once a month.
[1074.30s -> 1077.94s]  That's an outhouse.
[1077.94s -> 1079.94s]  Almost at two stars.
[1079.94s -> 1082.76s]  A new catering job's opened up. You can view the
[1082.76s -> 1084.76s]  challenge in the extra events menu. Good luck.
[1084.76s -> 1093.13s]  Catering event.
[1093.13s -> 1097.42s]  Burger pizza party.
[1097.42s -> 1104.33s]  Do I have it? I don't know. I don't have it.
[1104.33s -> 1106.33s]  I really do need to get a pizza.
[1106.33s -> 1109.08s]  Sixteen hundred.
[1109.08s -> 1111.90s]  Fuck. No. I can't. I need to save money.
[1111.90s -> 1115.59s]  Back to the menu.
[1115.59s -> 1119.18s]  We're getting rot.
[1119.18s -> 1121.93s]  Should I do baked potato?
[1121.93s -> 1123.93s]  Put the burger back on the menu. It's more money.
[1123.93s -> 1125.93s]  I don't want the lasagna. Fuck the lasagna.
[1125.93s -> 1129.26s]  Get the steak off there. French fries.
[1129.26s -> 1131.26s]  We're a burger and fish restaurant now.
[1131.26s -> 1137.46s]  Anything else for the inspection passed?
[1137.46s -> 1139.46s]  Today's buzz increased by ten percent.
[1139.46s -> 1152.12s]  Let's go.
[1152.12s -> 1154.12s]  I'm a weirdo that hates steak.
[1154.12s -> 1156.12s]  I don't hate steak. I just don't order it.
[1156.12s -> 1158.12s]  Oh my god.
[1158.12s -> 1160.12s]  Medium diet. Just throw it away.
[1160.12s -> 1162.12s]  How do I toss this? Is there a toss this button?
[1162.12s -> 1172.62s]  No salt.
[1172.62s -> 1179.19s]  Yeah.
[1179.19s -> 1181.19s]  No. I don't order steak. I don't like
[1181.19s -> 1183.19s]  steak. Really.
[1183.19s -> 1185.43s]  I like shaved steak.
[1185.43s -> 1187.67s]  But
[1187.67s -> 1189.67s]  it's not appetizing to me at all.
[1189.67s -> 1191.67s]  When somebody says
[1191.67s -> 1193.67s]  Oh hey man. Do you want a
[1193.67s -> 1195.67s]  medium rare steak?
[1195.67s -> 1197.67s]  I...no.
[1197.67s -> 1201.94s]  Absolutely not.
[1201.94s -> 1203.94s]  I'll eat like steak and cheese sub. I'll eat
[1203.94s -> 1205.94s]  like flank steak and stuff. I just don't
[1205.94s -> 1212.98s]  really like it. I like ketchup
[1212.98s -> 1214.98s]  on steak. I do not.
[1214.98s -> 1218.25s]  I don't know where you got that info.
[1218.25s -> 1226.38s]  What do you want? Meat, lettuce, bacon, cheese,
[1226.38s -> 1228.38s]  tomatoes. You want everything.
[1228.38s -> 1242.78s]  What do you want? Small water with ice.
[1242.78s -> 1245.98s]  With ice? Rats.
[1245.98s -> 1249.75s]  Drink small tea with ice.
[1249.75s -> 1256.58s]  A beer.
[1256.58s -> 1259.02s]  A medium diet with ice.
[1259.02s -> 1261.02s]  What do you want? A medium cold with ice.
[1261.02s -> 1270.47s]  One patty.
[1270.47s -> 1274.06s]  Oh god. One patty.
[1274.06s -> 1276.06s]  Meat too. Lettuce,
[1276.06s -> 1278.06s]  bacon, cheese, tomato. Get it out of here.
[1278.06s -> 1280.68s]  Meat tomato.
[1280.68s -> 1283.24s]  Get it out of here. Meat
[1283.24s -> 1285.24s]  bacon, double cheese, and
[1285.24s -> 1291.00s]  tomato. Get it out of here. You want a triple
[1291.00s -> 1293.18s]  cheeseburger? Relax.
[1293.18s -> 1302.39s]  Holy shit. I
[1302.39s -> 1308.47s]  would not eat that. Triple cheeseburger
[1308.47s -> 1316.98s]  is too much. Double is perfect.
[1316.98s -> 1318.98s]  I don't know how unpopular or popular
[1318.98s -> 1320.98s]  this statement is going to be.
[1320.98s -> 1323.42s]  But I find
[1323.42s -> 1325.42s]  a hamburger patty that is more than
[1325.42s -> 1327.42s]  four ounces to be gross.
[1327.42s -> 1335.53s]  It's just me.
[1335.53s -> 1337.53s]  I'll take a double. A double cheeseburger
[1337.53s -> 1339.53s]  with two four ounce patties.
[1339.53s -> 1341.53s]  I think that still works.
[1341.53s -> 1349.14s]  I really don't like when people make these
[1349.14s -> 1351.14s]  big ass fucking gigantic
[1351.14s -> 1353.14s]  eight ounce hamburger
[1353.14s -> 1356.98s]  patties. There's a balance
[1356.98s -> 1358.98s]  there that is just you don't step over.
[1358.98s -> 1364.42s]  Yeah, no, I'll take an eight ounce
[1364.42s -> 1366.42s]  of meat as long as it's two four ounce patties.
[1366.42s -> 1372.95s]  Oops. Yeah, that's fine.
[1372.95s -> 1374.95s]  But when people do double patties in this
[1374.95s -> 1376.95s]  six to eight ounce patties, that's just, no.
[1376.95s -> 1378.95s]  That's too much. You can't do a double
[1378.95s -> 1383.37s]  once it's four ounces. I mean it.
[1383.37s -> 1391.82s]  What about
[1391.82s -> 1393.82s]  a two ounce patty and a six ounce
[1393.82s -> 1396.31s]  patty? That would be weird.
[1396.31s -> 1398.31s]  That would be strange.
[1398.31s -> 1400.62s]  What about a single six ounce patty?
[1400.62s -> 1414.82s]  That's pushing it.
[1414.82s -> 1422.06s]  Come on. What about a big
[1422.06s -> 1424.06s]  thick steak? No, I don't like steak.
[1424.06s -> 1432.44s]  Small cold with no ice.
[1432.44s -> 1435.19s]  Large cold with no ice.
[1435.19s -> 1437.19s]  Bacon, meat, cheese.
[1437.19s -> 1439.37s]  Meat, bacon, cheese. And a tomato.
[1439.37s -> 1443.91s]  Oops. Small cold with no ice.
[1443.91s -> 1448.97s]  Got it. Bacon, lettuce, tomato.
[1448.97s -> 1452.55s]  But you don't want to...
[1452.55s -> 1454.55s]  What about the burger I just cooked for you?
[1454.55s -> 1460.89s]  Why are you guys ordering BLT
[1460.89s -> 1468.25s]  hamburger buns? Hurry up!
[1468.25s -> 1477.85s]  No, but
[1477.85s -> 1480.34s]  I think, and sometimes we go to a
[1480.34s -> 1482.34s]  restaurant that
[1482.34s -> 1485.35s]  I don't know, I don't know what it is.
[1485.35s -> 1488.23s]  Some restaurants, they pride themselves
[1488.23s -> 1490.23s]  on having these giant
[1490.23s -> 1492.23s]  ten ounce fucking hamburger patties.
[1492.23s -> 1494.23s]  And you know when you can taste?
[1494.23s -> 1496.23s]  You can just taste
[1496.23s -> 1498.41s]  meat. And it's
[1498.41s -> 1500.41s]  gross. It's like just
[1500.41s -> 1502.41s]  eating a giant meatball. I don't want to do
[1502.41s -> 1505.61s]  that. An eight
[1505.61s -> 1507.61s]  ounce fucking, a ten ounce hamburger patty
[1507.61s -> 1509.61s]  is a gigantic meatball between
[1509.61s -> 1512.04s]  two pieces of bread. No.
[1512.04s -> 1523.24s]  I hate it when I can taste my food.
[1523.24s -> 1525.24s]  No, it's very specific.
[1525.24s -> 1532.47s]  Too much meat flavor.
[1532.47s -> 1536.76s]  Am I a vegetarian?
[1536.76s -> 1539.32s]  I have a very important question for you. Do
[1539.32s -> 1547.70s]  vegetarians eat meat?
[1547.70s -> 1549.70s]  No. Right. Okay. So
[1549.70s -> 1552.65s]  I just, you've seen me eat a McChicken
[1552.65s -> 1556.74s]  on camera.
[1556.74s -> 1559.37s]  You're a pretend meat eater?
[1559.37s -> 1561.37s]  I do actually like the Beyond Burgers
[1561.37s -> 1563.37s]  though. They are really, really fucking good.
[1563.37s -> 1565.37s]  I cannot pretend there.
[1565.37s -> 1567.86s]  I talked so much shit
[1567.86s -> 1569.86s]  about those burgers, it was unbelievable.
[1569.86s -> 1572.74s]  I was a certified
[1572.74s -> 1574.74s]  shit talker for
[1574.74s -> 1580.76s]  Beyond Meat. But
[1580.76s -> 1582.76s]  I have had it and it is
[1582.76s -> 1586.47s]  pretty good. Pretty good.
[1586.47s -> 1589.10s]  E.D. certification is no
[1589.10s -> 1591.10s]  purchase. Equipment menu.
[1591.10s -> 1600.25s]  What is it? What shit
[1600.25s -> 1604.41s]  did I talk?
[1604.41s -> 1606.41s]  It was mainly how I didn't think the company
[1606.41s -> 1608.41s]  was worth even
[1608.41s -> 1610.41s]  close to what the stock price was worth.
[1610.41s -> 1612.41s]  Because I saw that. I mean that was big news.
[1612.41s -> 1614.41s]  Beyond Meat worth like fucking
[1614.41s -> 1616.41s]  five, a hundred billion dollars or something.
[1616.41s -> 1618.41s]  With like a three hundred dollar stock
[1618.41s -> 1620.41s]  price. And I'm like there's no fucking way. What the hell is that?
[1620.41s -> 1626.62s]  That's bullshit.
[1626.62s -> 1628.62s]  That's worth more than
[1628.62s -> 1631.69s]  like Nvidia. So I talked a bunch of
[1631.69s -> 1634.25s]  shit. Off camera though.
[1634.25s -> 1638.47s]  Alright, I gotta get them.
[1638.47s -> 1640.47s]  One more day and I can do pizza.
[1640.47s -> 1656.33s]  Maybe we should do these.
[1656.33s -> 1658.33s]  Fisher's gotta come off.
[1658.33s -> 1660.33s]  No, I can't do lasagna.
[1660.33s -> 1662.33s]  I'm not capable.
[1662.33s -> 1664.33s]  How many times have you heard that
[1664.33s -> 1667.66s]  in this stream?
[1667.66s -> 1678.02s]  I'm not capable.
[1678.02s -> 1681.16s]  Small tea with ice.
[1681.16s -> 1683.16s]  I've had
[1683.16s -> 1685.16s]  lots of fake meats before
[1685.16s -> 1687.16s]  and almost all of them
[1687.16s -> 1690.10s]  are gross.
[1690.10s -> 1692.10s]  You name me any of the most popular brands
[1692.10s -> 1694.10s]  of fake meat and I'll tell you that
[1694.10s -> 1696.10s]  they are not good. I've had almost all of them.
[1696.10s -> 1703.40s]  But the Beyond Burger
[1703.40s -> 1705.64s]  was pretty good.
[1705.64s -> 1708.65s]  You know the most chicken you eat is actually
[1708.65s -> 1712.87s]  soy. I don't buy that.
[1712.87s -> 1715.82s]  I really don't.
[1715.82s -> 1732.90s]  Yeah, maybe from Subway.
[1732.90s -> 1737.19s]  Most chicken that I eat is chicken.
[1737.19s -> 1748.58s]  Oh boy, I can take the trash off.
[1748.58s -> 1750.58s]  Are you shitting on Subway?
[1750.58s -> 1752.58s]  No, I just said...
[1752.58s -> 1754.58s]  You know what? I'm just gonna say
[1754.58s -> 1764.63s]  what up.
[1764.63s -> 1766.63s]  Meat to meat, lettuce, bacon,
[1766.63s -> 1768.94s]  cheese, tomato. Get it out.
[1768.94s -> 1770.94s]  This one is double meat, lettuce,
[1770.94s -> 1772.94s]  bacon, cheese, tomato.
[1772.94s -> 1774.94s]  This one is meat, tomato
[1774.94s -> 1776.94s]  only. What a weirdo.
[1776.94s -> 1778.94s]  That's weird. That is like having a ketchup
[1778.94s -> 1781.18s]  steak. Small cola with ice.
[1781.18s -> 1797.43s]  I feel attacked.
[1797.43s -> 1800.70s]  What are you talking about?
[1800.70s -> 1802.70s]  People that say you eat steak and ketchup.
[1802.70s -> 1805.32s]  That's alright.
[1805.32s -> 1807.32s]  But saying having a hamburger with just a tomato
[1807.32s -> 1809.32s]  on it is not...
[1809.32s -> 1811.94s]  Sorry, that was like
[1811.94s -> 1813.94s]  a zeppelin apparently. Okay, hold on.
[1813.94s -> 1815.94s]  No!
[1815.94s -> 1829.64s]  No, I like all kinds of foods.
[1829.64s -> 1832.52s]  I do not
[1832.52s -> 1834.52s]  care what kind of food it is. If I like
[1834.52s -> 1840.60s]  the taste good, I'll eat it.
[1840.60s -> 1849.69s]  Just buttery, please. What about
[1849.69s -> 1863.18s]  human?
[1863.18s -> 1865.93s]  No, I'm not gonna eat
[1865.93s -> 1867.93s]  fucking human meat.
[1867.93s -> 1873.30s]  Medium diet with ice.
[1873.30s -> 1883.78s]  How long can I
[1883.78s -> 1886.54s]  stay quiet for?
[1886.54s -> 1888.54s]  Probably a pretty long time. You wanna test?
[1888.54s -> 1893.40s]  If I would get an adult
[1893.40s -> 1895.40s]  swim show for eating human meat,
[1895.40s -> 1897.58s]  would I do it? No.
[1897.58s -> 1899.58s]  No, 100 times.
[1899.58s -> 1910.07s]  Meat, lettuce, bacon, cheese to meat.
[1910.07s -> 1920.62s]  Stop talking. What about for a billion
[1920.62s -> 1926.82s]  dollars?
[1926.82s -> 1929.06s]  But I don't know. No, because
[1929.06s -> 1931.06s]  who am I eating?
[1931.06s -> 1933.24s]  I don't wanna do
[1933.24s -> 1937.53s]  that. I don't know who am I eating.
[1937.53s -> 1948.66s]  Oops. I've seen Are You
[1948.66s -> 1950.66s]  Afraid of the Dark before. I know that this comes with
[1950.66s -> 1967.50s]  like a caveat here.
[1967.50s -> 1969.50s]  Would you eat human meat
[1969.50s -> 1971.50s]  for a billion dollars?
[1971.50s -> 1973.50s]  I don't know.
[1973.50s -> 1975.50s]  I guess so. But little
[1975.50s -> 1981.06s]  do you know. You're eating
[1981.06s -> 1983.06s]  your dear great
[1983.06s -> 1985.06s]  great grandfather and it's like
[1985.06s -> 1988.52s]  no! What is it? Meat only.
[1988.52s -> 2005.54s]  Can't wait for the pizza.
[2005.54s -> 2012.38s]  I did that very poorly. You would do
[2012.38s -> 2017.37s]  that for a hundred bucks.
[2017.37s -> 2019.37s]  That's not worth a hundred bucks.
[2019.37s -> 2022.12s]  It's not.
[2022.12s -> 2027.61s]  It's not worth a hundred
[2027.61s -> 2032.60s]  dollars. You think eating...
[2032.60s -> 2034.60s]  No. This conversation
[2034.60s -> 2036.90s]  is over.
[2036.90s -> 2038.90s]  We're not talking about this anymore.
[2038.90s -> 2044.47s]  What about that meeting?
[2044.47s -> 2046.71s]  Shit! What time is it?
[2046.71s -> 2048.71s]  Oh no! I missed
[2048.71s -> 2052.74s]  the meeting. I missed it.
[2052.74s -> 2054.74s]  There was like seven executives I was meeting to.
[2054.74s -> 2058.65s]  And I told them like I'm doing this
[2058.65s -> 2060.65s]  big stream. I was kind of
[2060.65s -> 2063.08s]  short on cash. I asked
[2063.08s -> 2065.08s]  them if they could like pay for all the food and shit before
[2065.08s -> 2067.51s]  I got there. And I said there was gonna be like
[2067.51s -> 2069.51s]  probably thirty people I was inviting.
[2069.51s -> 2080.31s]  Uh oh. It's alright.
[2080.31s -> 2083.96s]  New active menu slot. Rain.
[2083.96s -> 2085.96s]  What's a good rainy day food?
[2085.96s -> 2087.96s]  Ooh. Pizza. Let's get it.
[2087.96s -> 2090.46s]  I'm buying a fresh
[2090.46s -> 2095.90s]  pizza.
[2095.90s -> 2111.00s]  1600. Let's go.
[2111.00s -> 2113.00s]  Okay. Put that pizza on there.
[2113.00s -> 2115.43s]  Now we're talking.
[2115.43s -> 2117.43s]  I gotta get the lasagna back in here as much
[2117.43s -> 2119.43s]  as I don't want to do it. I hate the lasagna.
[2119.43s -> 2121.67s]  PCMSR.
[2121.67s -> 2123.67s]  PCMR.
[2123.67s -> 2125.67s]  PCR on NR.
[2125.67s -> 2127.67s]  PMCSR. I don't remember.
[2127.67s -> 2145.08s]  Medium water.
[2145.08s -> 2147.08s]  With no ice. With ice.
[2147.08s -> 2149.58s]  Fucking idiot.
[2149.58s -> 2151.58s]  Call me an idiot. I am gonna call you an idiot.
[2151.58s -> 2153.94s]  You opened up the second game and
[2153.94s -> 2155.94s]  couldn't fucking figure it out so you quit it immediately.
[2155.94s -> 2159.08s]  Grow up.
[2159.08s -> 2161.08s]  Way to be harsh. I'm just telling you
[2161.08s -> 2164.98s]  like it is. But I
[2164.98s -> 2166.98s]  wanted just to relax. I didn't want to have to fucking
[2166.98s -> 2168.98s]  like learn a game and embarrass myself in it.
[2168.98s -> 2173.91s]  You can't simply learn
[2173.91s -> 2175.91s]  like two or three new commands.
[2175.91s -> 2177.91s]  God.
[2177.91s -> 2200.04s]  If
[2200.04s -> 2202.04s]  Jerma986 thinks he's so great, why doesn't he
[2202.04s -> 2206.90s]  just do it?
[2206.90s -> 2208.90s]  And then
[2208.90s -> 2210.90s]  PSMCR.
[2210.90s -> 2229.19s]  I don't know.
[2229.19s -> 2235.08s]  PSMCR.
[2235.08s -> 2240.71s]  Ow. Fuck.
[2240.71s -> 2242.71s]  No. What am I pressing?
[2242.71s -> 2246.55s]  Okay. Small.
[2246.55s -> 2248.55s]  I forget. I don't know. I don't know what to do.
[2248.55s -> 2251.30s]  I fucked up. I don't know. I gotta. I need to restart.
[2251.30s -> 2253.30s]  Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[2253.30s -> 2259.38s]  How do you do it? How do you make a pizza?
[2259.38s -> 2261.38s]  Tomato sauce, cheese,
[2261.38s -> 2264.33s]  olives and onions.
[2264.33s -> 2267.53s]  Where's the fucking olives?
[2267.53s -> 2269.53s]  Why are the olives on the, on the, what?
[2269.53s -> 2271.53s]  Onions is N
[2271.53s -> 2273.83s]  again. Slow down.
[2273.83s -> 2275.83s]  Calm down. It's not a big deal. And V
[2275.83s -> 2286.33s]  is olives. So I think
[2286.33s -> 2291.77s]  yeah, I could put too much meat
[2291.77s -> 2293.77s]  on anything really. Pizza included.
[2293.77s -> 2302.98s]  People do like meat
[2302.98s -> 2305.54s]  lovers pizza. You
[2305.54s -> 2307.54s]  take a slice out of the pie
[2307.54s -> 2309.54s]  and it just center blocks
[2309.54s -> 2311.54s]  down and everything falls off and you can't
[2311.54s -> 2313.54s]  eat it. You just get like that weird bread taste
[2313.54s -> 2315.54s]  with like sauce all over it. And then there's
[2315.54s -> 2317.54s]  pepperoni sausage and hamburger meat all over the fucking
[2317.54s -> 2319.54s]  box. Why do people do that?
[2319.54s -> 2332.98s]  Stop it. I hate you.
[2332.98s -> 2335.42s]  I like meat on pizza. I like hamburger.
[2335.42s -> 2337.42s]  I like onion hamburger and onion
[2337.42s -> 2339.42s]  sausage and peppers and
[2339.42s -> 2341.42s]  but I don't like sausage hamburgers
[2341.42s -> 2343.42s]  pepperonis
[2343.42s -> 2346.17s]  lamb and
[2346.17s -> 2348.17s]  turkey all over it. Like I don't know.
[2348.17s -> 2360.26s]  Why? What animal
[2360.26s -> 2366.15s]  does an onion come from?
[2366.15s -> 2377.67s]  Would I eat crickets?
[2377.67s -> 2380.66s]  I mean maybe.
[2380.66s -> 2384.06s]  Depends.
[2384.06s -> 2386.06s]  No, but I do like meat on pizza. I'm just
[2386.06s -> 2388.55s]  just shit posting.
[2388.55s -> 2400.84s]  Sorry guys.
[2400.84s -> 2402.84s]  PSRPSC
[2402.84s -> 2412.31s]  Season 3
[2412.31s -> 2414.31s]  form juice. Good.
[2414.31s -> 2423.78s]  The steaks we need.
[2423.78s -> 2430.44s]  Good. We're good.
[2430.44s -> 2434.60s]  Not a bad day.
[2434.60s -> 2442.34s]  Come on. Hurry up and cook.
[2442.34s -> 2445.42s]  Tomato sauce. Cheese.
[2445.42s -> 2447.42s]  I wanted to do C.
[2447.42s -> 2465.78s]  Just put everything on it.
[2465.78s -> 2472.25s]  Jerma slurp.
[2472.25s -> 2475.70s]  How did I do that that easily?
[2475.70s -> 2479.86s]  Because I wasn't paying attention.
[2479.86s -> 2481.86s]  I did that incredibly fast and incredibly perfectly.
[2481.86s -> 2486.22s]  Don't ever make that
[2486.22s -> 2489.29s]  an emote. Well I'm not on screen.
[2489.29s -> 2499.14s]  How would I do that? Jerma your stream is so
[2499.14s -> 2501.14s]  loud in comparison to other stuff on Twitch.
[2501.14s -> 2503.14s]  When an ad pops up it blows off
[2503.14s -> 2505.64s]  my speakers. Yeah.
[2505.64s -> 2507.64s]  I don't know what that is.
[2507.64s -> 2510.01s]  But I think it has to do with
[2510.01s -> 2512.38s]  how I'm pulled through OBS.
[2512.38s -> 2514.38s]  And what's going to happen here
[2514.38s -> 2516.38s]  in the next, I don't know, I'm going to get
[2516.38s -> 2518.38s]  like a hardware mixer to like
[2518.38s -> 2524.78s]  increase it before it goes in.
[2524.78s -> 2526.78s]  So that'll happen soon.
[2526.78s -> 2535.10s]  You're making an entire lasagna for a
[2535.10s -> 2537.78s]  This is Chad
[2537.78s -> 2539.78s]  from the meeting. Why are you playing this?
[2539.78s -> 2543.05s]  Chad I'm sorry.
[2543.05s -> 2545.42s]  I got the day wrong.
[2545.42s -> 2549.83s]  I bet you can't get through today without
[2549.83s -> 2552.52s]  making a single bad order.
[2552.52s -> 2558.54s]  I'm not taking that bet. Okay.
[2558.54s -> 2560.71s]  Large crowds.
[2560.71s -> 2566.98s]  It's weird because if I look at
[2566.98s -> 2569.61s]  OBS right now, if I
[2569.61s -> 2571.61s]  according to the meter for
[2571.61s -> 2573.61s]  my microphone on OBS,
[2573.61s -> 2575.78s]  it says I am
[2575.78s -> 2577.78s]  very close right now to peaking
[2577.78s -> 2579.78s]  my microphone, like to being in the red.
[2579.78s -> 2584.78s]  So it's something how I'm
[2584.78s -> 2586.78s]  getting pulled into OBS and OBS is not putting
[2586.78s -> 2596.57s]  it out the way that it should be.
[2596.57s -> 2598.57s]  What I need is I need like a hardware compressor.
[2598.57s -> 2600.57s]  But then, you know, this is why I haven't done it.
[2600.57s -> 2602.57s]  Because then when you put like a
[2602.57s -> 2604.57s]  compression and like an equalizer on your voice, you end up
[2604.57s -> 2606.81s]  with one of these. You guys know exactly
[2606.81s -> 2608.81s]  what I'm talking about, where everything is like super
[2608.81s -> 2610.81s]  over equalized and you sound like you're coming out
[2610.81s -> 2613.62s]  of a radio station. I don't like
[2613.62s -> 2626.94s]  how that sounds. We need more equalization.
[2626.94s -> 2628.94s]  Some people do it fine.
[2628.94s -> 2630.94s]  Most people do it fine. But sometimes
[2630.94s -> 2632.94s]  you find the person that has just like, you know, let me turn
[2632.94s -> 2634.94s]  that up. So it's just
[2634.94s -> 2636.94s]  this incredibly weird over
[2636.94s -> 2638.94s]  incredibly smooth sounding
[2638.94s -> 2640.94s]  sound and everything that they say is sounding
[2640.94s -> 2643.43s]  kind of like this. Well, you know guys, the
[2643.43s -> 2645.86s]  thing is, yeah, I think I have to go
[2645.86s -> 2648.23s]  pick up that thing on the, yeah,
[2648.23s -> 2650.23s]  what do I need, uh, ten of those? I think I need that. Yeah, I do.
[2650.23s -> 2657.98s]  Am I shit talking? No, I'm not.
[2657.98s -> 2664.82s]  Uh, guys, I'm getting one of these.
[2664.82s -> 2668.34s]  You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna, okay, the first
[2668.34s -> 2670.34s]  day, you're gonna know I have this, because the first
[2670.34s -> 2672.71s]  day I have this, I'm gonna, I'm gonna bang
[2672.71s -> 2674.71s]  up the equalization as high as I
[2674.71s -> 2681.50s]  can go. It's gonna be so
[2681.50s -> 2686.04s]  awful. I want every syllable
[2686.04s -> 2688.04s]  to have a
[2688.04s -> 2690.41s]  compressed sound to it. Every single
[2690.41s -> 2692.41s]  syllable is going to sound like this.
[2692.49s -> 2693.69s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[2693.69s -> 2695.69s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[2695.77s -> 2698.15s]  I'm gonna over equalize the fuck out of my
[2698.15s -> 2700.15s]  voice now and I'm gonna keep it for like six
[2700.15s -> 2706.58s]  months all right let's take, uh,
[2706.58s -> 2708.58s]  bake potato instead of steak,
[2708.58s -> 2717.02s]  keep pizza on there. Put a hard limiter
[2717.02s -> 2719.02s]  and just crank up the gain.
[2719.02s -> 2731.11s]  Just butter.
[2731.11s -> 2733.11s]  B for butter, Y for butter.
[2733.11s -> 2743.86s]  This is Chattington, your boss, you're fired.

[3950.10s -> 3983.05s]  fucking water this is gross i think these dishes is there a website that that can determine how
[3983.05s -> 3985.93s]  fast you click something like how fast you can click something in like 10 seconds
[3986.94s -> 4016.06s]  i want to break the world record real quick before i leave do i think people try to get
[4016.06s -> 4023.43s]  my attention with outlandish comments nowadays i mean people just kind of write crazy shit
[4023.43s -> 4049.80s]  just to write it so i don't think more than ever jesus jesus what's this one i think this is going
[4049.80s -> 4071.70s]  to be a this is going to be a perfect day but no i don't think that well the thing is another
[4071.70s -> 4078.95s]  thing to keep in mind is the channel has grown a lot in the last year and a half or so last year
[4080.65s -> 4085.13s]  so you know the over under that somebody might just come into the channel and just write pee
[4085.13s -> 4092.14s]  pee poo poo and then leave i mean it's it's fairly high so you know that's possible
[4100.49s -> 4106.94s]  do i wish that i have grown this much i mean that's kind of a weird question because
[4107.99s -> 4111.43s]  i guess the my ultimate goal whenever i do this stuff is i want to
[4112.87s -> 4119.35s]  make as many people happy or laugh and be in on the joke as possible right so
[4120.63s -> 4136.58s]  i don't think it's oh no i don't want to i don't want to have any viewers there's two people tell
[4136.58s -> 4148.25s]  me to go back to play team fortress yeah that happens not that often though but i mean that's
[4148.33s -> 4157.08s]  what that's i don't doesn't really bother me because at the end of the day no my perfect score
[4158.44s -> 4182.70s]  no what if i just don't serve it all right what's that website click as fast as possible about
[4182.70s -> 4209.19s]  something the speed test clicking speed test this is cookie clicker this is a cookie clicker
[4209.19s -> 4234.68s]  optimizer website is there another one just play cookie clicker no not reaction time i'm talking
[4234.68s -> 4247.80s]  how fast you can press the button as fast as possible okay this one so it clicks in five
[4247.80s -> 4253.93s]  so how fast can you click in five seconds all right here we go i just want to see yeah that
[4254.57s -> 4283.69s]  there it is i gotta get ready for this though okay let's get that on screen okay why can i not move
[4283.69s -> 4298.33s]  this why can i not show this what the fuck is going on here oh there we go okay it's because
[4298.33s -> 4301.85s]  it's being blocked by cook serve delicious and i just would have known that if i looked at my
[4301.85s -> 4314.82s]  screen so let's see how fast i can do this so the record do you know the world record is 14.1
[4314.82s -> 4334.18s]  clicks per second are you ready for me to beat the world record i'm gonna have to lie on the
[4334.18s -> 4354.04s]  ground for this though i actually might i'm gonna have to lie down that's first try that's 12.4
[4354.04s -> 4364.04s]  clicks per second i can i'm gonna beat the world record what do i what do i need 14.1 whoa that's
