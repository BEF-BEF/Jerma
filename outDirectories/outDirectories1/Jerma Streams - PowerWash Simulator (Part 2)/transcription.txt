[3.00s -> 11.93s]  Hello. Hold on. Sorry. Welcome to the stream, everybody. How you doing? What's going on?
[14.58s -> 22.65s]  That was a really unenthusiastic hello. Hello. Let me just grab my tea. I got a green tea. Let me get
[22.65s -> 73.83s]  it. I'll be right back. That EU stream today. That's right. We're back. Okay. So today,
[74.55s -> 85.13s]  as you're probably recognizing, we've got a sponsor segment today. It's gonna be a good one.
[85.13s -> 97.16s]  This is Power Wash Simulator. If you remember, I played this game about a year ago. And what do you
[97.16s -> 106.60s]  know? This shit's in 1.0. It's out. I think actually literally today. Like right now.
[107.24s -> 213.35s]  Hold on. I got the wrong straw. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's go. Let's go.
[213.35s -> 225.74s]  Let's go. Yeah, the stream is sponsored today by of course, Power Wash Sim. It's out on everything.
[225.74s -> 235.38s]  Xbox, Xbox One, PC, Steam, everything. Go take a look. And so since a year ago,
[235.38s -> 239.53s]  I think they've added a lot of shit to the game. So we'll see what they have.
[243.30s -> 262.92s]  Is this on Xbox? Dude, I'm so happy you asked. It's on Xbox, Xbox One, PC, Steam, Xbox Series S.
[265.06s -> 272.50s]  Why did that take me so long to say that? No, I actually really like this game. This game was
[272.50s -> 275.38s]  really fun last time I played it. So I'll have a year of development, by the way.
[276.66s -> 286.25s]  Was this game in early access? Because was this only? That's a pretty awesome story there.
[287.48s -> 292.86s]  The game was in early access for like a year, year and a half, whatever. And now it's out.
[294.33s -> 309.45s]  That's it. Easy. Early access for like a year. Out. Released. All right. Let's go. This multiplayer?
[309.45s -> 319.34s]  What the? What? What? All right. Hi. Hello. All right. So what was it? What was in the game
[319.34s -> 328.25s]  last time? Was it just this career mode before? You're the same shirt as yesterday. No, what?
[328.25s -> 335.00s]  The shirt I had on yesterday was black. This is a gray shirt. How would this? This is not the shirt
[335.00s -> 350.52s]  I had on yesterday. This is gray. You're unclean. Well, yeah, maybe I could use a power washing.
[350.52s -> 356.70s]  It's the same background. I'm sorry. I don't have a funny Zoom conference call joke where there's a
[356.70s -> 370.33s]  roller coaster behind me. Dude, it has cross play with Xbox players too? Holy shit. Can I swear on
[370.33s -> 380.68s]  this? I think so. Okay. I hope so. All right. So what did I do last time? All right. I wait,
[380.68s -> 388.47s]  did I not finish this? Oh, it's so it kept the other stuff that I did. All right, cool.
[388.47s -> 400.28s]  What's specials? Clean the Mars Rover, gnome fountain, steam locomotive, golf course. Should
[400.28s -> 411.45s]  I do the golf course? Free play? All right. So should I finish what I started here?
[414.12s -> 422.34s]  I took a power washing job a year ago and I did half the house. I just left. And then
[423.08s -> 431.02s]  I called the same family a year later and I go, hey, come back and finish that job
[431.02s -> 442.63s]  that I did halfway. The same price, of course. All right, let's go. Yeah, this is,
[442.63s -> 451.26s]  I like it. I'm gonna turn the volume up. It's a little low. I don't know if it's too loud.
[457.96s -> 471.42s]  How did I turn it way down? Why did I turn the volume so low? Why is everything so low?
[472.47s -> 477.62s]  There we go. Okay, well, that that's why I did that.
[481.05s -> 492.79s]  That was a little too loud. That was a little too loud for my for my liking. Okay, there we go.
[493.72s -> 499.42s]  All right. So what's wrong with it? What's wrong with this? You were doing a bit the last time
[499.42s -> 507.50s]  you played. What was the bit I was doing? Oh my god, I hope nobody was at the front door.
[509.14s -> 521.64s]  This is like a laser. Okay, I didn't do anything. What was the routine I was doing last time?
[521.64s -> 528.49s]  It was oh yeah, it was all dogs talk like Scooby-Doo. That was a fucking year ago.
[531.35s -> 549.10s]  I felt like that was last weekend. How was that was that long ago? Oh, I love it. Oh, all right.
[549.10s -> 565.58s]  So I missed this whole side of the house. Taking care of your gutters for free.
[566.39s -> 585.59s]  And that's when I leave a card. I leave a card on the fucking front step. Oh, isn't there a button
[585.59s -> 594.68s]  you can do to see how much is left? How much of cleaning you have to do left? Tab. Yeah, there's
[594.68s -> 601.91s]  like there's like a hitman like see through walls thing, right? How did I get how do I get on the
[601.91s -> 609.72s]  roof? They're looking out the window right now. Honey, I don't know where you found this guy,
[609.72s -> 631.37s]  but he keeps spraying the same two sections of the house. And he charges $1,000 an hour. Oh,
[631.37s -> 640.38s]  you can rotate the nozzle to y'all. Yeah, you can. I remember this fast. Is this the new
[640.38s -> 645.74s]  phasmophobia update? No, this is power wash simulator. It's available right now. It just
[645.74s -> 652.62s]  came into 1.0 games. Great games fun. We played it. It's been a while. You can get it right now.
[652.62s -> 663.62s]  I highly suggest you do the game is fucking phenomenal. No music. What the hell is this?
[665.99s -> 686.87s]  Why did they why did they they added a VR mode? All right. What is this? No music. How did I turn
[686.87s -> 708.25s]  it off? Did I remove it from like the I&I files? I don't know. I don't think so. But somebody asked
[708.25s -> 712.25s]  but hey, is it out for Xbox? I'm really glad you asked that question. Of course it is.
[712.97s -> 717.45s]  Xbox Series S. Actually, is it on? I don't want to say something that's not true.
[720.18s -> 729.26s]  It's on. All right. Xbox has that service, right? Where you can it's a service that you can you can
[729.26s -> 737.19s]  pay for and it's something could be on that service. Is it on that service? Is it in there?
[739.83s -> 747.21s]  It's on that service. All right. All right. Somebody said, what did I do?
[748.01s -> 758.47s]  I mean, I mean, honest to God, I got to tell you, it's just good clean fun.
[758.47s -> 760.87s]  Like really, it really is though. I'm like, I'm serious.
[776.02s -> 780.62s]  What if this don't do the roof? How the fuck are they going to know? You know what I mean?
[781.18s -> 786.58s]  They're going to come out here. They're going to go. Oh, wow. Oh, you did such a good job.
[786.58s -> 791.54s]  Look at that garage door. Look at that window. It hasn't been clean like that in 20 years.
[791.54s -> 799.03s]  They're not going to go on the roof and look at their ceiling. Why would they do that?
[799.03s -> 803.67s]  And if Dad wants to be like, oh, can I check the roof? I'd be like, that's done. That's unsafe.
[803.67s -> 808.73s]  Let a professional go up there. And then I'll go up there and I'll look around and be like,
[808.73s -> 814.81s]  this is clean as hell. Holy shit. This is clean. And then that dad's going to be in like slippers
[814.81s -> 818.78s]  and he's going to have a newspaper and he's going to go, oh, yeah, but you'll lick the top of the
[818.78s -> 838.41s]  roof. And I'm going to be like, of course I will hurry up. You don't hurry up a job like this.
[842.06s -> 844.70s]  This is I'm power washing. You don't hurry up.
[845.50s -> 868.04s]  By the way, how did I go from 50% to 40%? I don't get it. You're making it worse.
[868.76s -> 877.48s]  There's not dirty water in here. It's clean water. You're going to spend an hour washing
[877.48s -> 884.76s]  the front steps. No, I'm not going to do that. Do I have a streamer mode on because of the music?
[886.39s -> 904.34s]  I don't think I do. Streamer mode, autosave, aim mode, stance, dirt details, FOV, obviously,
[904.34s -> 910.50s]  right? I don't think so. I think it's my game. I think I just, I don't know, try the YouTuber
[910.50s -> 914.26s]  mode. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I like, maybe I think I screwed something
[914.26s -> 928.74s]  up. Wait, how about reset audio defaults? Should I try that? I don't, is there even music in the game
[928.74s -> 939.35s]  here? I need the, okay, I need this, the, the bigger nozzle. Give me the wide one. No,
[939.35s -> 950.42s]  always the wide one. There it is. All right. Every time I ever see anybody power wash,
[950.42s -> 955.38s]  they always do it so wrong. They always do this thing where they like, oh, did I do it?
[955.38s -> 960.23s]  No, what you have to do is you have to act like a, like a copy machine. You have to do,
[960.23s -> 976.55s]  it's kind of like robotic movements. Then you touch up. I love that sound. The sound effect
[976.55s -> 988.14s]  is actually really good. All right, now back it up. Do you remember thinks he knows everything?
[988.86s -> 999.83s]  No, but I, I've, I've power washed before. I've, I've done it before. Not professionally,
[999.83s -> 1006.57s]  but I've, I've done it before. All right, no one messing around. Let's actually,
[1006.57s -> 1019.13s]  let's actually get this done. Okay, sure. I, I've power washed before. Yeah. And some of you clowns
[1019.13s -> 1034.28s]  that power wash, you do this. Trust me. I know the technique, the look it's clean. And then,
[1034.28s -> 1052.12s]  you know, dad comes out and goes, no, it isn't. And you're like, fuck. And then dad's going to
[1052.12s -> 1061.70s]  take it anyways at the end. I had him just do it all again. No, no, no, stop, stop. Let me see that
[1061.70s -> 1075.96s]  for a second. Let me, let me see that. All right. That's good. It's like, dad, you just,
[1075.96s -> 1081.46s]  you just did the whole thing again. And then, and then you go, no, no, no, dad, let, give,
[1081.54s -> 1089.90s]  give me that thing. Because it's fun to do. And you end up power washing the same thing,
[1089.90s -> 1102.65s]  like four times. All right. I think the front steps are fine. Did I miss anything? Oh,
[1102.65s -> 1120.95s]  hold on. I did. Watching your stream makes me sneeze. I, I think I would calculate the dust
[1120.95s -> 1131.99s]  in your room. Are you sure it's not when you're sitting at your computer? There's no time limit
[1131.99s -> 1146.73s]  on this. It's fine. Is this pre-recorded? Why, why, why would this be? No, it's pre-recorded.
[1147.69s -> 1157.69s]  Pre-recorded. Oh, that it's done. That's the only thing I've done though. How long have I
[1157.69s -> 1166.76s]  been playing? I've been playing for 20 minutes and I finally got my first ding. What? How long
[1166.76s -> 1194.71s]  have I been sitting here for? I just got my first ding in 20 minutes. That's impossible. This is,
[1194.71s -> 1205.45s]  oh, what? I mean, where's my ladder? That's the best part, by the way. That's the best part
[1205.45s -> 1218.97s]  right here. And then, and then when you see all the dirt just fly everywhere and it turns into
[1218.97s -> 1232.10s]  this like brown sewer water looking stuff. Oh my God. I love it. Okay. So 43 recycled joke.
[1232.74s -> 1240.52s]  How's that? That's not a recycled joke. What are you talking about? Recycled joke. You don't
[1240.52s -> 1251.69s]  remember what I said a year ago. Okay. You don't remember what I said a year ago. And by the way,
[1251.69s -> 1264.74s]  how is that a joke? That's me saying I like something. You know, like I'm not ordering food
[1264.74s -> 1267.30s]  at a restaurant with you. And it's like, Oh, what do you want, man? What do you want to eat?
[1268.50s -> 1271.46s]  Dude, I think I'm doing the like, I don't think I'm just gonna go with like the turkey club.
[1274.02s -> 1278.10s]  What are you really gonna order though? I'm ordering a turkey. I like turkey sandwiches.
[1278.10s -> 1286.26s]  It's cool. Dude, stop stop this fucking bit and order a tuna sandwich. What are you? What are
[1286.26s -> 1317.64s]  you talking about? Second ding in the night. There it is. There we go. All right. Is that
[1317.64s -> 1326.20s]  it's kind of loud. Let me turn that down. Just a just a tiny bit. Just a little. Let me turn this
[1326.20s -> 1344.66s]  up. Turn this down. Just a little. That sounds nice. Is that better? A little more. Now we can
[1344.66s -> 1356.49s]  hear the birds and shit. That's better. That's better. That's better. Okay. That's good.
[1360.63s -> 1374.52s]  There's up to six people in co-op, by the way. That seems kind of chaotic. I need the ladder
[1374.52s -> 1381.99s]  now because there's no way I'm going to do that. I'm not gonna be like it up there. Should I change
[1381.99s -> 1392.60s]  this? Oh, no. I had this upgraded once already. All right. So where's this still dirt? Oh,
[1392.92s -> 1419.27s]  this is the best part. Here we go. Check this out in one sweep. It feels good.
[1433.19s -> 1447.77s]  I was holding my breath for that one. Oh my god. The what the the whole top of the house
[1447.77s -> 1457.62s]  needs to be done. There we go. You're gonna start seeing dings every five seconds now.
[1462.02s -> 1474.18s]  Steps? Where? Concentrated blast. I'm pissing somebody off so bad right now. You know what
[1474.18s -> 1481.21s]  I mean? There's at least a few of you in the chat right now that have had a clenched fist
[1481.21s -> 1502.04s]  since I turned it on the stream. Doesn't it feel like it's something is adding more dirt to it?
[1502.04s -> 1506.36s]  That's every time you power wash. This happens. I feel like I did this five times already,
[1508.92s -> 1525.88s]  but I didn't. There we go. Where's my ding? Where's my ding? Oh my god. It's underneath.
[1531.43s -> 1536.79s]  The splash was like reflecting off of this guy's car and I thought the police were here.
[1537.51s -> 1555.45s]  I was like, wait, what? I how I can't get underneath. How am I supposed to get
[1555.45s -> 1583.06s]  underneath here? I need this one yet on spins. There we go. Let's see a ding
[1588.22s -> 1623.02s]  like this. I'm doing this so wrong. Stand up. Just get up. What? All right. That's good enough.
[1623.02s -> 1630.34s]  That's actually good enough. It is. No human can come out here and tell you're gonna come out here
[1630.34s -> 1642.15s]  and swab it and send it to a lab and test it for dirt. There's nothing else here. I'm sorry. If I
[1642.15s -> 1647.96s]  see out the window, this guy lying on his back aiming up at the same place, I'm gonna go out.
[1647.96s -> 1651.64s]  I'm gonna open the door and be like, that's good. That's good. You don't have to do it. That's all
[1651.64s -> 1681.05s]  right, man. Don't worry. Stop peeling the paint. It's the whole railing. Oh my goodness. Look at
[1681.05s -> 1710.44s]  all this. Got it. What? No way. That shit was here. That's part of the foundation of the house at
[1710.44s -> 1723.30s]  this point. All right. It's not, I can't clean it. All right. You look like emperor Palpatine.
[1723.94s -> 1728.31s]  I was going to give you a no. I was going to just do the laser hands into the screen.
[1728.87s -> 1760.86s]  I'm like, nah, I was going to laser hands you. Oh my God. What's this thing? Change stance.
[1761.75s -> 1767.99s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Change stance. What does that mean? Oh, wait, there,
[1767.99s -> 1775.93s]  there are three stances. Okay. I, one of them is crouched. The other one is lie down. I'm
[1776.01s -> 1781.29s]  proning, crawling right now, crawling around. You imagine looking out the window,
[1781.29s -> 1789.16s]  you see like a guy like, let's go. Just proning and like, got him.
[1792.95s -> 1808.74s]  A guy proning in your front lawn, just like aiming up with the power washer. All right.
[1808.74s -> 1818.52s]  I'd stop coming over here. I keep doing the front door. This is going into their house.
[1819.24s -> 1824.54s]  I'm sorry. If you have this meticulous about this, this water going into the house,
[1826.36s -> 1830.92s]  nobody has weather stripping. That's that good. This is going like, this is going in the house
[1831.96s -> 1847.74s]  into their living room. The guys get over the front door. It's water all over them. Like it
[1847.74s -> 1862.90s]  took a shower. He's going to be like, is that supposed to happen? Standing there for 20 minutes,
[1862.90s -> 1870.66s]  blasting the door. I wouldn't, I feel like this would break a window, right? I wouldn't want to
[1870.66s -> 1902.20s]  do that. I can't still be there here. You physically can't get up there. Nobody can.
[1902.20s -> 1926.97s]  I have to, I have to ricochet it. I can't do it. Got it. All right. That's done. Good. What the
[1927.53s -> 1939.69s]  what? How I've done, honest to God, I've done this 10 times. How can this still be edges of the fence
[1939.69s -> 1965.67s]  that I haven't gotten? I don't understand. I feel like it's respawning. This is like resident evil
[1965.67s -> 1985.82s]  mold on this person's house. I've done this like five times. Well, duh, it's your enemy. It's an
[1985.82s -> 2004.71s]  FPS, but again, yeah, the stream is sponsored by power wash simulator. This game's actually really
[2004.71s -> 2016.74s]  fucking fun and you can get it on Xbox, Xbox S steam, everything, all this stuff. It's got co-op.
[2016.74s -> 2036.70s]  It's in 1.0. This is a different person's house. What the hell happened? Wait, what? Um, excuse
[2036.70s -> 2054.95s]  me. Okay. Well, where do I even start? Okay. I get up. Don't start this yet. Yeah. I know that's
[2054.95s -> 2070.81s]  dirty. I know there's dirt on this side. This is a Harvey dent house. No, this is, this is like two,
[2070.81s -> 2075.70s]  two roommates or it's like, it's a duplex. There's two tenants here. One of them is, you know, evil
[2075.70s -> 2085.02s]  and the other one's like an angel and they share a flat together. All right. Where's this? Where's
[2085.02s -> 2095.99s]  the, uh, how do I get to the, I'm going to go up on the roof. Although it actually is prone. It's
[2095.99s -> 2108.65s]  been blocked by my drink this whole time. How do I visit ladder? Oh, hi. All right. Let's, let's take
[2108.65s -> 2125.34s]  care of this because this is ridiculous. I feel like I should do this from the ground. All right.
[2125.34s -> 2131.69s]  Here's the one incredibly important factor in this whole thing. Don't leave until it's done.
[2132.33s -> 2138.70s]  You know what I mean? Don't leave until it's all gone. What I keep doing is I keep spraying and
[2138.70s -> 2145.82s]  talking and spraying and I just walk away. Don't leave this spot until it's, this is all gone
[2145.82s -> 2160.49s]  because I keep just walking away after spraying it. Okay. So far so good. All right. So that's,
[2160.49s -> 2168.94s]  this is done on this side. What about up here? Okay. So now I just got to deal with this.
[2169.66s -> 2188.26s]  You've sponsored the power wash and you can't do it. I think I'm doing just fine. I think I'm
[2188.26s -> 2195.10s]  doing just fine. You're at 6% an hour. Do you have any idea how long it would take to power wash
[2195.10s -> 2201.16s]  this house in real life? The condition of the outside of this house, it would take two months.
[2204.70s -> 2209.35s]  I would have to come back and do reverse coats of paint. You know what I mean? I'd have to,
[2209.35s -> 2213.43s]  I would have to come back on three separate occasions in like four or five separate weeks.
[2214.71s -> 2252.07s]  This would take three months to do. Here we go. Think someone could speed run this game.
[2252.07s -> 2255.03s]  That would be awesome. I'm sure people have already tried to do it.
[2262.30s -> 2267.48s]  I wonder. People already do. Yeah. I wonder. I wonder just this house in particular. I wonder
[2267.48s -> 2282.12s]  how long it took to do a 100%. You better believe that's going to be hard to do. I think we're
[2282.12s -> 2298.34s]  almost good. I have to have a ding coming soon. It has to be, right? Really? Get out of the,
[2298.34s -> 2310.31s]  what the hell? There it is. All right. So there's that ding. I like the beard. You should grow it
[2310.31s -> 2317.32s]  out. I can't. I literally can't. This is like one of those ads for mobile games where the person in
[2317.32s -> 2321.40s]  the ad is like insanely incompetent. And so you want to download the game just to show that you
[2321.40s -> 2334.06s]  can actually do it unlike the dumb ass in the ad, but that's so unfair. Well, then go get it.
[2334.06s -> 2339.59s]  Then go get it. It's on, it's on Xbox. It's on steam right now. It's on fucking game pass. Go get
[2339.59s -> 2347.75s]  it. Why don't you do it? That's so unfair though. You know why that's unfair? Because in those mobile
[2347.75s -> 2351.91s]  game ads and trust me, I've seen millions of them. I've seen millions of those ads. I play,
[2351.91s -> 2358.52s]  all I do is play iPad games. You understand that they, it's usually like, oh no, there's a fire.
[2359.24s -> 2364.12s]  What do we do to put the fire out? And there's two options pop up on screen here and here. And one of
[2364.12s -> 2370.78s]  them is a fire extinguisher and the other one is like a golf club. And it's, they try to drag the
[2370.78s -> 2378.63s]  golf club up on the fire. I'm not doing that here. I'm, I'm not doing that. I'm, I'm, I'm power washing
[2378.63s -> 2388.34s]  doing it the correct way. If I had a golf club in my hands and I was hitting the side of this house,
[2388.34s -> 2420.22s]  then I would understand your point. But I, come on. The golf club is your brain. All right. Did I,
[2420.22s -> 2433.34s]  I didn't finish this part. I'm getting tutorials. Oh, it's because I'd never pressed them. Okay.
[2434.74s -> 2442.15s]  So this is done, right? All right. This one's done. Keep going. Now with the, I'm moving on.
[2442.79s -> 2446.79s]  This whole side of the house has to get done, but I'm not doing that right now. 40 only,
[2446.79s -> 2453.59s]  of course it's 47%. I have the Satan demon person that lives over on this side. I have to do their
[2453.59s -> 2515.42s]  house. I want to try to get it up over the fence. I don't, I physically don't think you can. It
[2515.42s -> 2520.89s]  legally touched my truck. Therefore it's mine. It touched my truck. Therefore it's legally mine.
[2520.89s -> 2541.86s]  Where'd it go? I never put my hands on it. What was I doing? Oh yeah. I gotta go for it.
[2541.86s -> 2559.46s]  You're doing the mobile ad. No, even if I were to sit here and do this. Okay. Nozzle four. Oh,
[2559.46s -> 2565.61s]  what it worked. I would still be doing more than the mobile ads always do. You understand? Like
[2565.61s -> 2570.41s]  I'm actually still doing it. I'm still actually pressing the button and washing the side of the
[2570.41s -> 2581.11s]  house that like, even if I was doing it like that, you know, what's actually really funny about,
[2581.11s -> 2586.36s]  about mobile ads now, I think we've talked about this a little bit, but there's a, there's a game
[2586.36s -> 2591.48s]  that I see ads for all the time now. And it's like, aren't you getting sick and tired of those
[2591.48s -> 2597.86s]  ads that show the slide, the puzzle game, and it's never in the game. We have that in our
[2597.86s -> 2605.03s]  fucking game. We actually have that. All these like posers, it's so funny. And you know what?
[2606.31s -> 2613.59s]  They must be pissed. They must be pissed off because they actually have this slide, the puzzle,
[2613.59s -> 2618.81s]  watch out for the fire and get the gold game. Right. And everybody else just is doing that in
[2618.81s -> 2624.66s]  their ads. And they just have to sit there and go, well, that's our game. We actually have that in
[2624.66s -> 2632.31s]  the video game. It's like, do you want to play that game? We have it. If we actually have that
[2632.31s -> 2639.37s]  in our game, they don't, it's been debunked. No, I know. But my point is that there are companies
[2639.37s -> 2647.10s]  right now. I'm getting ads right now of somebody literally saying, Hey, those ads are bullshit.
[2647.10s -> 2654.78s]  Aren't they? I know we have that game. It's not fair. I swear. I promise you. But they don't have
[2654.78s -> 2670.86s]  it either. What? It's not in that game either. Hold on a minute. But how you can't how you I
[2670.86s -> 2675.58s]  don't know about that. I feel like that's inaccurate. You can't make an ad stating,
[2676.22s -> 2681.51s]  Hey guys, aren't you sick and tired of those ads that show that game and it's not in the game?
[2681.51s -> 2698.28s]  Download ours. Ours is in there. It's not in there. What? No, no way. That's impossible.
[2698.28s -> 2707.50s]  It's true. What? Okay, but hold on. It might not be the core of that game. Right? It might not be
[2707.50s -> 2720.52s]  the core gameplay of that game. But is it in the game? And can you actually do it? No. What? No,
[2720.52s -> 2733.19s]  it's not. It's impossible. Hey, fuck all those other games, man. We got that in our game and
[2733.19s -> 2745.21s]  it's not in the game. No, I cannot speak to that. I don't know how true that is. Dude, why doesn't
[2745.21s -> 2752.39s]  somebody just make one of those? Just make a slide the puzzle game. And then you can be the savior,
[2752.39s -> 2767.66s]  the hero of the mobile game ad world. You know what I mean? Just make one. Because I'll tell you,
[2767.66s -> 2771.66s]  if I downloaded a game and I saw that it had the sliders in it, and that kind of and that it was
[2771.66s -> 2778.55s]  just 100 levels of like 500 levels of that game. I'd be like, you know what? Nice job. Nice work,
[2778.55s -> 2794.62s]  actually. Actually good work. All right, now somebody has to edit edit me in to just like
[2794.62s -> 2800.04s]  interior of just like a living room. And you know, just like, you know, family just kind of like
[2800.04s -> 2805.24s]  whatever sitting around like a stock image or something, and have muffled audio of that what I
[2805.24s -> 2812.94s]  was just doing. And have loud kind of footsteps on the top of the roof. I think that would be
[2812.94s -> 2853.88s]  pretty funny. Hi, what is left? I'm gonna get more concentrated here. God, I'm just thinking about
[2853.88s -> 2873.38s]  this right now. There's an engineer move in TF2. Slow me down. Okay, let me rephrase that and
[2873.38s -> 2881.66s]  say what I wanted to say. A TF2 weapon as a power washer would actually be pretty fun.
[2883.69s -> 2928.84s]  Like a jet of water jet. Come on, give me the ding. The ding is so close. The ding is so close,
[2928.84s -> 2948.23s]  dude. Come on. Where's the ding on the side of the house? This one little piece? Where is it?
[2949.35s -> 3009.18s]  Right here. Come on. Ding. How come I'm not getting a ding? Is this why down here? You've got to wash
[3009.18s -> 3024.49s]  your sin. I think that would take a while. Only red is the wall. Wait, what do you mean? What do
[3024.49s -> 3057.29s]  you mean? What are we talking about? Hold on. I'm typing. Hold on. I'm typing. You need to relax.
[3057.29s -> 3063.11s]  Okay, so it's just the entire wall. How do I get from here to there?
[3071.35s -> 3089.99s]  God, that was fun. There's a much better way I can do that.
[3089.99s -> 3100.02s]  There's a much better way I can do that. So should I? Okay, for all you power washers out there,
[3100.02s -> 3108.73s]  it's big nozzle straight down into sections, right? So I start here and walk backwards.
[3108.73s -> 3118.95s]  This is poop from an airplane. Oh my god, dude. Yeah, there's so many bird shits on this house.
[3120.17s -> 3127.59s]  Honestly, you know what's crazy though? I wonder how much bird shit is on your roof.
[3129.22s -> 3142.04s]  It's probably awful. It's probably crazy. I can't imagine what everybody's just straight down
[3142.04s -> 3152.01s]  bird's eye view of roof looks like. Because unless you do something like this, it's probably covered
[3152.01s -> 3177.42s]  in bird shit. It rains. Not everywhere. It does not rain a lot in every location. Not here. Not in
[3177.42s -> 3203.24s]  Vegas. I wonder how many bird shits I have on my roof. Are you keeping track? How would you keep
[3203.24s -> 3212.36s]  track of bird shits? What are you gonna go up there every few days? Go for the clipboard? Just
[3212.36s -> 3225.27s]  see your neighbor just like he's making marks and you don't clean it. All right, so that top is
[3225.27s -> 3237.66s]  all right. Now I'm gonna go this way first. Don't forget about the chimney. You know, I have to give
[3237.66s -> 3244.17s]  the devs credit because that it's not just like, oh, yeah, just spray it a little and just go side
[3244.17s -> 3249.06s]  to side and you did it. You actually have to do this. You have to actually truly power wash this
[3249.06s -> 3261.77s]  house. I have to actually get in here and do all this. It seems like there's a lot more content
[3261.77s -> 3266.71s]  since when we last played a year ago. Does the game look better? I feel like the graphics are
[3266.71s -> 3299.66s]  better. Am I out of my mind? It's the same house. It's a year later. Don't fall. You're just spraying
[3299.66s -> 3318.89s]  into the chimney. Yeah, I gotta clean the chimney too. Oh my god, I can jump high. I'm looking at
[3318.89s -> 3337.94s]  the ding. I can't get in there. I can't get in there. It's unsafe for me to get in here.
[3337.94s -> 3388.23s]  I need that with the wiggle one. It's unsafe. I can't get it to ding either. Maybe I just spray
[3388.23s -> 3399.34s]  it up there. It's right. It's this tiny little piece on the left. Just get on the other side.
[3399.34s -> 3411.40s]  Can I can I put the ladder up there? You missed the whole right side. Oh, it's all good. We're good.
[3411.40s -> 3425.59s]  There should be a grenade. Why are you seriously making me contemplate if that would work?
[3425.59s -> 3436.50s]  If you had a device that was a water grenade, but what would you use it for? It was a pressurized
[3436.50s -> 3444.47s]  water system in the thing and it would just like shot out. That wouldn't it would work. No, it
[3444.47s -> 3456.06s]  wouldn't. It would clean soap and water in the grenade. Well, hire the cleaning service. Yeah,
[3456.06s -> 3461.82s]  you think I just shows up. He's got like fucking grenades on him. He's just like, yeah, I'm ready.
[3461.82s -> 3467.66s]  Everybody if we could get up out of the house, that'd be great. Everybody leaves. Okay, so what's
[3467.66s -> 3478.42s]  the dirtiest room in the house? Bedroom? Okay. It's just soap and just the bedroom's destroyed.
[3493.40s -> 3518.18s]  Phil's water grenades. That'd be $800. You walk out. Phil's like in his car. He's doing like some
[3518.18s -> 3522.95s]  paperwork and it's like, oh, thanks for coming, Phil. And he's like, yeah, yeah, it's all good.
[3522.95s -> 3527.35s]  Hold on a second. I'm going to clean my car. You look and you like, yeah, your car's looking a
[3527.35s -> 3533.19s]  little dirty, Phil. Don't worry about it. I got it. He just steps out. He just throws the
[3533.19s -> 3543.56s]  grenade in the car and it's just cartoon. Just the car just goes like, boop. There's just some
[3543.56s -> 3552.94s]  papers fucking everywhere. This is like, there's all kinds of like destruction. He goes to turn
[3552.94s -> 3562.01s]  the car on. Hey, look, buddy. I think I could borrow your car for a few hours. I've got a
[3562.01s -> 3581.13s]  few more. I got a few more of these jobs. I've been cleaning the safe spot for 15 minutes.
[3581.77s -> 3612.10s]  Yeah, man. I know. Let us bet on what? What do you need to bet on? Water, C4.
[3613.22s -> 3631.37s]  You just set them up around the whole house. What are you talking about? All right, slow down,
[3631.37s -> 3650.86s]  slow down. This is not powerful enough. You see, we got, I got to go harder. That's Splatoon.
[3651.42s -> 3657.62s]  Yeah, but nobody's going. I can't do this on camera. It's like weird.
[3659.78s -> 3666.09s]  You know, the exact thing I was going to do. Everybody knows the exact sound effects. I was
[3666.09s -> 3673.29s]  just going to do all of you. You saw my neck go like this, tilted. You knew exactly what was
[3673.29s -> 3694.42s]  going to happen. I feel like that's too predictable. We don't care. We want it. All right, mods, run a
[3694.42s -> 3700.10s]  poll, please. If it gets to at least 80% with at least 5,000 votes, I'll do the noise. I'll do the
[3700.10s -> 3715.29s]  thing that everyone wants me to do. Remember everybody, you saw my neck tilt. You know what
[3715.29s -> 3724.04s]  could have happened? So will you play Splatoon with it? I don't, I couldn't play Splatoon. I
[3724.04s -> 3730.02s]  don't know why something about it. Just, I just, I kind of just didn't, I didn't get it. I know,
[3730.02s -> 3735.46s]  I completely understand, but the counter, you know, I, it kind of just triggered old memories
[3735.46s -> 3741.22s]  of playing Tony Hawk with friends. And it was that mode where if you did a trick on something,
[3741.22s -> 3747.06s]  it would change to their color. I remember just doing really well and just like boom, orange,
[3747.06s -> 3750.58s]  but boom, orange, but boom, orange, orange. And I had the whole, and then I would turn around for
[3750.58s -> 3757.78s]  five seconds. And my, my dickhead friend has got like a 2 million point combo going. And he runs
[3757.78s -> 3760.74s]  over every single thing I did. And I just turn around, it's all blue and it's like, why am I
[3760.74s -> 3776.86s]  playing the game? So I, that's why I don't like, that's just Splatoon for me. All right, let's see,
[3776.86s -> 3786.23s]  at least over, it has to be over 80% and it has to be at least 5,000 votes. And I'll do, I'll do it.
[3786.79s -> 3794.73s]  Somebody just said, dude, it takes two clicks to vote. Come on guys. And there's some of you just
[3794.73s -> 3807.19s]  sitting there leaning back, just like, nope, I ain't doing that. I don't care. It's so funny
[3807.19s -> 3811.91s]  doing the votes and polls and just the amount of people that just genuinely just don't care
[3811.91s -> 3817.03s]  about any of this. It's just like, I don't care what he does. Just, I, I just like kind of hanging
[3817.03s -> 3824.62s]  out. Do we like applaud those viewers by the way? They just hang out, they just watch, they just
[3824.62s -> 3844.84s]  chill. They don't have to vote. It's time to do it. What the fuck? 95%? Are you kidding me?
[3845.48s -> 3860.89s]  I thought this was impossible. Okay. Well, all right, fine. I don't, somebody had to,
[3860.89s -> 3872.26s]  had bought a better fake that or something. There you go. That's why I don't do that with
[3872.26s -> 3903.45s]  a camera on. I'm available, but I probably won't show up. 95%. I don't think we've ever
[3903.45s -> 3919.29s]  seen that before. I, I've never seen a 95% with that many votes. Dude, I love this game. You know
[3919.29s -> 3925.37s]  why I love this game? Cause I can just power wash and we can talk about splatoon noises. It's
[3925.37s -> 3986.44s]  perfect. Hashtag ad. Yeah. Hashtag ad. That's right. Copium. What? Why do you think,
[3986.44s -> 3996.25s]  when you do an iPad stream? Um, you know, I set up the iPad stream, but I just, I just didn't,
[3996.97s -> 4005.16s]  I just didn't do it because I don't know. I downloaded 50 of these wacky wild iPad games,
[4006.31s -> 4012.54s]  but I would, some of them just wouldn't open. I, I didn't want to play them off stream because
[4012.54s -> 4016.94s]  they'd want to have genuine like, what the hell's going on reactions, right? But I would open some
[4016.94s -> 4021.75s]  of them. And this, this became an issue where I was like, you know what, like let's just see
[4021.75s -> 4026.07s]  if some of them work, right? Some of them just didn't turn on. Some of them would crash after
[4026.07s -> 4035.93s]  10 seconds. And if that became not funny. So now there's going to be a new system in place.
[4036.65s -> 4039.29s]  This is the stream that I want to do. I want to do a stream where,
[4041.67s -> 4049.05s]  and years ago, this, this concept was, was thought up that you play an iPad game with no,
[4049.61s -> 4057.75s]  with no premium purchases. And every time an ad comes up, you download that game and move on to
[4057.75s -> 4073.16s]  that game that you see every time, no matter what, that's the game. So I think we're going
[4073.16s -> 4083.67s]  to do that. Or you, it's because you might get an ad immediately after, after downloading one of
[4083.67s -> 4092.20s]  these. And I guess some of the rules we could make is it has to be a full page ad. It can't
[4092.20s -> 4095.96s]  just be something, a banner that pops up on the bottom or whatever, right? It's got to be a full
[4095.96s -> 4109.16s]  page ad advertising a game, a game that can be downloaded on the app store. That's the plan.
[4109.16s -> 4158.63s]  All right. Roof is almost done. 57%. 57. I'll probably get it if I do the other side.
[4158.63s -> 4179.11s]  All right. I'm going to speed run this. Ready? Three, two, one. Um, I'm not going that fast.
[4179.67s -> 4197.05s]  Let me try. I'm not, I'm not, I can't, I, I can't go fast. Maybe I can just go fast.
[4197.69s -> 4214.81s]  I can go kind of fast. Maybe it's enough to get the, uh, the ding because the other side is,
[4214.81s -> 4256.57s]  is immaculate. Oh my God. Um, hello. Is this the grind bandits? I need some help with my
[4256.57s -> 4262.15s]  poor little play school. Oh, another thing. Carefully go around the volcano. Wait,
[4262.15s -> 4276.07s]  am I getting a bunch of work requests? Oh no, it's Tony Hawk. Go careful around the volcano.
[4276.07s -> 4284.39s]  What volcano? We went down there to enjoy a smoky sunset and Jenny saw a UFO. Why am I part of this
[4284.39s -> 4289.03s]  group text? Don't fucking group text me. I'm so sick of this shit happening. Stop group texting
[4289.03s -> 4294.55s]  people. Don't pull, you know what? The dumbest fucking thing. I can't even understand how this
[4294.55s -> 4305.21s]  was ever a thing. You cannot leave a group text if there's people with iPhone and Android. Why can't
[4305.21s -> 4312.89s]  you just leave? Why can't you just leave? Just leave. I don't want to keep getting pulled in.
[4319.22s -> 4323.30s]  People will just be sitting there talking about a bunch of shit. And then at some point,
[4324.18s -> 4327.54s]  Hey, Jeremy, what do you, what do you thought? And I'm just like,
[4329.86s -> 4334.55s]  I don't want to tell them that I've had this whole conversation on mute for six or seven straight
[4334.55s -> 4356.95s]  weeks. Why did I give this guy my number? Hey dude, I'm going to come do a job for you. Yeah,
[4356.95s -> 4363.21s]  that sounds good. I'll come do the job for you. Here's my rate. Hey man, this is kind of an old
[4363.21s -> 4370.07s]  building. Isn't that interesting? Yes, it is very interesting. Yeah. What kind of stone do you think
[4370.07s -> 4376.95s]  they made this out of? I don't know. I'm going to get a look. I'm going to get a text. I'm going
[4376.95s -> 4387.02s]  to be like, what's your favorite pasta? And you, you know, like rigatoni. And then it goes in the
[4387.02s -> 4401.14s]  pocket. Rigatoni in the pocket. And then this guy's going to start sending me Morse code with the
[4401.14s -> 4429.24s]  amount of times I'm going to get a message. Go finish the house first. Oh man, there's different
[4429.24s -> 4443.45s]  levels of strength you need. Okay. Did they sell a UFO here? Dude, you came back after a year
[4443.53s -> 4451.05s]  and didn't finish. I stopped around their house, blew up one of their windows and
[4452.01s -> 4456.73s]  shoved the nozzle into the chimney and ruined their furniture in their living room
[4456.73s -> 4478.28s]  and then left. I'll be back in another year. And I'll put the group text thing. I don't hate text
[4478.28s -> 4483.24s]  people. I don't hate whatever. I just hate telephones. I just hate phones. You know what
[4483.24s -> 4487.18s]  is, you know, let me tell you something. Some of you kids, you know, back, back in the day,
[4487.74s -> 4493.10s]  like, you know, that everybody has a phone now, everybody will see everything they ever say,
[4493.10s -> 4498.47s]  you know what I mean? Even if you don't have read receipts on it, at least once or twice,
[4498.47s -> 4503.59s]  at least three or four potential times a day, people know that people all look at their phones
[4503.59s -> 4507.99s]  at least a few times a day. So there's no way you didn't see my text, right? There's no way you
[4507.99s -> 4514.10s]  didn't get my phone call. See, back in the day, everyone had a landline and it would be as simple
[4514.10s -> 4525.54s]  as I don't care. I'm not answering that phone. And then it was implied that just needless weren't
[4525.54s -> 4534.55s]  home. Or sometimes you'd pick the phone up. Hello. Hi, is, is, is, is, is Jeremy there?
[4534.55s -> 4551.94s]  And, uh, no, no, it's not here. Oh, okay. Thanks. Easy. Now everybody has a phone.
[4551.94s -> 4556.26s]  Everybody knows you have that phone. Everybody knows I have a, everybody knows you have a phone.
[4556.26s -> 4565.88s]  So you can't like, I'm so, I am very notorious for just not responding for a long fucking time.
[4565.88s -> 4572.06s]  I just, and it's not that I don't care. It's just like, oh, there's like, I don't know what to do.
[4572.06s -> 4592.73s]  I don't know what to say. I know you can set up like DND, right? Like do not disturb. And I don't
[4592.73s -> 4597.50s]  know. Shouldn't we all collectively have this message that we all agree on, right? Everyone
[4597.50s -> 4602.70s]  has a message that's a good, it's a separate DND box that you check. And it's just like, look,
[4602.70s -> 4605.90s]  I'm just kind of don't fucking give a shit right now. Like I, like, I don't really like want to
[4605.90s -> 4609.82s]  answer phone calls or I guess that's what, you know, like, but like a separate, like less,
[4609.82s -> 4614.46s]  not like serious DND. Like, I just kind of don't care. Like right now, maybe like I'll get back to
[4614.46s -> 4621.13s]  you in a few days. Right? So if I get that, that we all agree on that text, right? Like it's signed
[4621.13s -> 4625.61s]  into like a Congress gets it and they sign a bill. It's just like, all right. Like we all know that
[4625.61s -> 4635.99s]  that's like, all right. Whatever. I'll talk to you in a few days. Or no, it could be just like a
[4635.99s -> 4643.35s]  single word, like a code word. I don't like the peanuts. If you get a DND back, that's just
[4643.35s -> 4659.82s]  peanuts. All right. Yep. Got it. I got you. Don't worry. Got it. But it sucks because somebody,
[4659.82s -> 4666.41s]  people would abuse the peanuts system, right? It'd be like, Hey, where the fuck is Jeremy?
[4666.41s -> 4677.58s]  Where is he? We got, we got peanuts. It's been, it's been three weeks and he won't respond about us
[4677.58s -> 4681.75s]  going to dinner on Thursday. Like what the hell do you just, you're abusing the peanut system.
[4686.23s -> 4689.75s]  And then finally get back to him. You're like, Oh yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I just, I kind of was like,
[4689.75s -> 4701.64s]  dude, I was busy and shit. And I didn't really, no one actually cares this much if you don't
[4701.64s -> 4713.99s]  respond. You know what? That's, that's pretty accurate. But still though, I, I never want
[4713.99s -> 4722.46s]  people to think I don't care. I do care, but like sometimes I'll get a text and then I'll have
[4723.62s -> 4731.53s]  like Kathy Mitchell on the iPad. And it's just like, fuck, but I don't even know. I,
[4735.14s -> 4742.63s]  and for some reason, my brain says, just press play again and just relax. It sucks. I hate it.
[4748.47s -> 4752.39s]  Cause in my brain, in my, my, I don't know, maybe I'm, maybe I'm, maybe I'm weird,
[4753.19s -> 4757.99s]  but to me putting on like DND to me and like sending a DND automatic response back to somebody
[4757.99s -> 4764.84s]  is almost like a, huh. Okay. Automatic response. Not going to even text me back. I get like an
[4764.84s -> 4771.62s]  auto response, auto generated message. Like, Hey, what are you up to? I'm sorry. That person is not
[4771.62s -> 4794.22s]  available to speak right now. Maybe he'll talk to you later. Okay. Sure. Auto generated. And let
[4794.22s -> 4801.98s]  me, let me be also frank too. I talk to a lot of people every day. I'm usually on the phone
[4804.46s -> 4815.30s]  at least four or five times a day. That's a flex. What is a flex? I just talked to a lot of
[4815.30s -> 4860.41s]  different people. Weird flex. Uh, what are my favorite color schemes by the way? He talks to
[4860.41s -> 4871.22s]  people, but he doesn't, he never wants to talk back to people. No, I don't just want to talk
[4871.22s -> 4876.82s]  at people. And so it's like, when I call you, you answer. When I text you, you answer. I, I get it
[4876.82s -> 4879.86s]  too. If I don't get a response, I'm just like, all right, cool. I'll see you. I'll talk to you.
[4879.86s -> 4888.73s]  Whatever. I'm not demanding that they give me their time. I'm just saying that I have, you know what
[4888.73s -> 4910.01s]  I mean? You get it. You missed a spot. This one's going to take a while. It's this, this is, oh,
[4917.94s -> 4920.98s]  so you know what I could do here, right? Check this out. All right. You ready?
[4921.62s -> 4944.28s]  Make sure that looks good. Okay. So right here, I could take a picture right here,
[4945.16s -> 4954.04s]  just of this, me standing in front of it, being like, it's like, yeah, just cleaning it up. But,
[4954.04s -> 4961.46s]  at Dave's skate park, really showing him how to do a clean job, right? Arms folded like this.
[4962.02s -> 4965.22s]  And the power washers leaning behind me. And there's an ad for my business right there.
[4965.78s -> 4971.94s]  And what they don't know is that I just, this is all this. And I get to about here
[4972.58s -> 4986.47s]  and I'm just like, I'm done. There's some dirt still on the wall. Oh yeah. Take the photo here
[4986.47s -> 4990.15s]  and have me stand there and then crop the absolute hell out of this and zoom in so it's
[4990.15s -> 4996.02s]  looking blurry and artifacted. And then somebody gets the original photo and leaks the original
[4996.02s -> 5006.12s]  photo. Now, is that a dumb viral marketing campaign that would be bad for my business or
[5008.79s -> 5057.03s]  what? I wonder. It would be such an epic troll. Still 1%. Oh God. Use the big nozzle.
[5057.59s -> 5065.99s]  The big nozzle doesn't get everything. Do I have access to different nozzles?
[5072.04s -> 5084.06s]  Is there a bigger one? Where can I buy stuff? Is there a store? How do I buy something?
[5084.06s -> 5106.41s]  Where's the store? It's somewhere, right? Where is it? Oh, right here. Oh, all right. Okay. Heavy
[5106.41s -> 5127.29s]  duty. Shit. I need 40 stars. Dude, these. Oh my God. There's there's like skins. Oh, all right.
[5127.29s -> 5137.11s]  Hold on. I don't want to spend any money though. No, I don't want to spend any money. Should I get
[5137.11s -> 5147.18s]  some soap? What kind of surface is this? Is this plastic? What is this? Steel? Granite? What is this?
[5147.18s -> 5158.58s]  What is it? Aluminum or something? What is all this? Concrete? Oh, it says multi-purpose. Okay.
[5159.22s -> 5174.28s]  So I need multi-purpose cleaner. Multi-purpose. Should I have bought that much? All right. So now
[5174.28s -> 5185.78s]  what does that do? Okay. Now how do I put the cleaning liquid on? No cleaner attached. How do
[5185.78s -> 5209.64s]  I do that? I have like five. Press three. Oh, okay. Cool. Is it on? Multi-purpose cleaner. I have to
[5209.64s -> 5237.16s]  buy the attachment. You need the soap nozzle. Oh, okay. 75 bucks. I already own it. Change to it.
[5237.16s -> 5248.63s]  You own it for the other washer. Oh, it's for the other one. Wait, what? Oh, really? Hold on.
[5248.63s -> 5260.22s]  I can't get it for the other one. Huh. Okay. So that's for the other one. Well, let me try it.
[5260.22s -> 5290.30s]  Give me the stub. Stubby. All right. What's this doing? I can get it for the other gun.
[5290.30s -> 5295.00s]  This actually kind of works. All right. Wait. Get it for the other gun. How much money do I have?
[5295.00s -> 5325.50s]  Okay. So clean power equipment, right? Oh, $375. I don't have enough for that. I might as well use it.
[5325.50s -> 5363.86s]  So this just makes it easier to do. Rinse it. Finish the house. I'll go back in a year. I'll
[5363.86s -> 5376.39s]  go back in like a year. This doesn't do anything. That is way more than I've done in an hour sitting
[5376.39s -> 5403.75s]  in the corner. This is doing way more than I was doing. Now rinse it. Do I have to rinse it?
[5403.75s -> 5418.01s]  I don't think so. No. I'm going to use the rest of it. Should I go? All right. Should I go back
[5418.01s -> 5420.89s]  to the house? All right. I'll go back. I'll go back to the house. I'll go back to the house.
[5420.89s -> 5432.62s]  I'll come back to this one later. I'll be fine. Soap only gets most of it off the weaker one. Okay.
[5432.62s -> 5442.82s]  Hey, look at this place. This place looks beautiful. So this is wood. Does multi-purpose
[5442.82s -> 5471.99s]  work on wood? Probably not, right? That's actually really good here. All right. Give me the ladder.
[5471.99s -> 5484.58s]  Can I put the ladder over here? I can't. What the hell am I doing? Oh my god. That's so much
[5484.58s -> 5495.72s]  easier. All right. I almost have the whole chimney. This doesn't work. That doesn't work here.
[5495.72s -> 5519.21s]  It works on the chimney. Oh, my ladder is not big enough. The ladder is not big enough to get all
[5519.21s -> 5537.90s]  the way up here. This side, the one facing the neighbor here. Jeremy, are you high on bath salts?
[5537.90s -> 5550.01s]  No. What? There it is. Got it. Okay. Now I want wood. I want wood cleaner. I feel like it's going
[5550.01s -> 5560.38s]  to be amazing. Stone cleaner. No. All right. Let me buy some wood cleaner. Wood cleaner.
[5560.38s -> 5568.76s]  There it is. Let's see if this works. Wood cleaner. It's on. Fill it up and let's go.
[5572.62s -> 5585.50s]  Works pretty good. Maybe it has got a great sound effect too. That's got an amazing sound effect.
[5591.64s -> 5596.44s]  Get off the fucking ladder, you idiot. What have I done? I just like ran into it and hit my head on
[5596.44s -> 5633.30s]  it. Looking good so far. Just leave an outline of the ladder. That would be so stupid. All right.
[5633.30s -> 5654.12s]  I got to go for the corner here. That's all right. Now we move the ladder. Actually, maybe not.
[5658.42s -> 5668.60s]  Hell, this is the way to do it. This is the way to do it. For sure. I still have cleaner left,
[5668.60s -> 5701.51s]  right? Yep. That took me two minutes. Two minutes. Perfect. All right. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[5701.51s -> 5714.41s]  All right. Move the ladder. Come on. Come on. Crap. It's okay. It'll ding any second.
[5719.38s -> 5734.65s]  That just scared the shit out of me. All right. Any more soap I can use. This is multi-purpose.
[5735.75s -> 5741.37s]  These are the railing. Okay. This is how is this? This is wood. Okay. It's all. Oh yeah. Let's refill
[5741.37s -> 5760.02s]  that. Yep. Fill it back up. Buy some more of that right now. Let's buy it all. Whatever. Check this
[5760.02s -> 5777.50s]  out. I'm spending money. How much money am I spending? Oh, that was 50 bucks. I'll make it
[5777.50s -> 5799.82s]  last and then I'll come back and just and touch it up. I'll touch it up. How's this wood? This looks
[5799.82s -> 5808.41s]  like stone. This is wood. Don't walk under the ladder. It's all right. I'll throw a fucking salt
[5808.41s -> 5818.71s]  behind me. I'll be fine. I'm asking a question. So if I walked under a ladder and okay, if I walked
[5818.71s -> 5824.39s]  through the ladder, but I walked backwards through the ladder, does that, does that negate it?
[5825.80s -> 5829.32s]  Does that let you say, okay, you went back, you undued. Does that, is that an undo?
[5832.95s -> 5839.26s]  No. Okay. So if I go through the ladder, then I take salt and I go like that. Wait, wrong shoulder
[5839.26s -> 5854.66s]  like that. Would that undo going through the ladder? No, it doesn't. It's the salt has no effect.
[5855.46s -> 5870.57s]  So what would negate going underneath the ladder? Nothing. Nothing. You literally nothing you do.
[5871.37s -> 5875.61s]  I feel like there's something you can do. You don't. That's not how it works.
[5876.33s -> 5887.18s]  What's wrong with going under a ladder? Somebody tell them. Somebody tell that. Somebody tell
[5887.18s -> 5899.70s]  that guy. Somebody tell them. It's 100 years bad luck. So if you walked under a ladder,
[5899.70s -> 5904.98s]  broke a mirror, threw salt over your left shoulder, opened up an umbrella, closed it,
[5904.98s -> 5920.39s]  opened up an umbrella. Do you just get struck by lightning right after doing that? It's a cheat
[5920.39s -> 5932.97s]  code. It's funny because I'm not superstitious at all. But I doesn't matter. I still wouldn't
[5933.69s -> 5946.68s]  open up an umbrella inside the house. Right. But I'm not super I don't I'm not I just just in case.
[5949.30s -> 5957.78s]  What if just in case like I would not right now open a umbrella in this room. I just it's
[5957.78s -> 5962.18s]  not that oh my god, I believe in that. But I just I don't know. I'm afraid of it. What if it's real?
[5962.98s -> 5976.23s]  What if it is bad luck? This house looks like shit. All right, we got all I soaked it up.
[5976.23s -> 5984.62s]  Is there any more what I can do? This is now this is multi-purpose. All right, well get rid of the
[5984.62s -> 5992.78s]  the wood one. Now we're gonna bring the nozzle back out. Okay, I would clean it. Let's put the
[5992.78s -> 6007.30s]  nozzles back on. I want where's where's my actual where's it? What? Oh, how do I get to the nozzle?
[6007.30s -> 6016.41s]  There we go. All right, medium duty. This one has extension though. I'm gonna put this one on.
[6021.18s -> 6028.50s]  I have to piss. Can I go pee? I gotta pee. I'll be right back. I gotta pee. And I'm finishing this
[6028.50s -> 6035.14s]  house and I'm finishing the gosh darn state skate park. I'll be right back. I'm gonna pee.
[6150.76s -> 6308.23s]  All right, I'm back. How are you? How's it going? You guys ready for more power washing? Oh, yeah.
[6311.93s -> 6319.03s]  You forgot to mute. We heard every last drop. You're disgusting. You're disgusting. Disgusting.
[6319.11s -> 6324.81s]  Disgusting chatter. Disgusting chatter. Disgusting chatter. Get rid of them. Disgusting chatter.
[6337.21s -> 6346.09s]  All right, let's do it. Back to the house. How much more of the house do I have to do?
[6348.60s -> 6354.04s]  Realistically, I'm at 73%. Do I get extra money for finishing the job?
[6355.72s -> 6367.35s]  I better. This got louder to me. Have I just gotten used to that sound? Did I get used to
[6367.35s -> 6377.59s]  that sound effect? What about baseball? Baseball. The German Baseball Association had its date
[6377.59s -> 6386.04s]  changed to August 19th. I know, Saj is in the chat. I know. But that is set in stone.
[6386.04s -> 6405.10s]  We're ready to go. This time, I mean it. This time, I mean it. You said that last time. Yeah,
[6405.10s -> 6421.02s]  but this would be, this would be strike three. This would be literally strike three. Set in stone.
[6421.02s -> 6431.19s]  It's no, it's set in stone. This has been etched into an etch a sketch. So you can just literally
[6431.19s -> 6459.22s]  go like this and it just changes. Dang. He's going to delay it again. I know I can't. So
[6459.94s -> 6467.54s]  if this gets delayed again, it's not going to happen till probably the fall. There's no way.
[6468.18s -> 6476.70s]  There is not a chance it gets delayed again. And I'm telling you, there's no way. No way. No way.
[6477.42s -> 6488.81s]  No way. There is literally no way. I know that's, that's copium, but there's no way.
[6501.70s -> 6510.71s]  Tag me. Oh yeah, that's, somebody has an account that says that. Somebody has an account that's
[6510.71s -> 6520.82s]  tag me when Jerma lies. That person has probably not logged into Twitch in like five years. That
[6520.82s -> 6539.67s]  account is probably inactive. It's probably been inactive for months, if not years. They were here
[6539.67s -> 6553.64s]  yesterday. They're actually here. Well, whoever this is, they're going to wake up one day and have
[6554.36s -> 6567.43s]  5,000 pings on their dashboard. You know what? I can't even buy anymore. Nevermind.
[6581.94s -> 6592.33s]  How does anyone know what the stream is? What do you mean? What happened? What happened?
[6592.33s -> 6610.66s]  Can you explain why it got delayed? Sure. One, two, three. It could have happened on that date,
[6611.38s -> 6614.90s]  but it would have been a show that was worse than the show I wanted to do.
[6616.39s -> 6620.23s]  Uh, we were pretty much ready to go. We had a couple of issues
[6621.27s -> 6628.92s]  that we had some, uh, some of the, some venue problems, right? So instead of just doing it
[6630.09s -> 6635.40s]  with those venue problems, I was like, you know what? Let's just make sure that we can do
[6635.40s -> 6646.34s]  the thing that I want to do. Uh, it would have been fine maybe, but after August and into September,
[6646.34s -> 6653.93s]  I'm going to be able to look back and go, I'm so glad we waited till August.
[6653.93s -> 6661.48s]  This whole process of trying to get, um, a venue, right, was way more difficult than I think anybody
[6661.48s -> 6669.51s]  anticipated. So we got one, then we got another one. Then we got told we couldn't do it at one
[6669.51s -> 6674.26s]  place. Then we got told we couldn't do it at another place. And then we had a date and then
[6674.26s -> 6678.26s]  that date had to change with this place. And so then we had to look and see if we could go
[6678.26s -> 6684.89s]  somewhere else. And it was like, no, I don't want to do that. So we ended up picking a new place
[6685.77s -> 6706.33s]  for August. It's pretty much what happened, but it's going to be, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[6706.33s -> 6713.22s]  I've been waiting to do this stream for almost two years. So when we finally get out there,
[6715.18s -> 6730.14s]  I'm going to be as happy as can be. Ding. All right. At what point can I close the job? 80%,
[6731.10s -> 6740.07s]  90%, 100%? When do I, when do I get to go? All right. That's it. You're on your own.
[6740.07s -> 6754.41s]  A hundred. Oh, all right. I'm focusing. Here we go. Focus up. Focus up. Always give 110%
[6754.41s -> 6776.50s]  Jerry. How long are you going to stream today? Um, I don't know. As long as I feel like it.
[6777.14s -> 6786.55s]  Don't mean to be a Debbie downer, but I've looked into the creepy symbols you found on
[6786.55s -> 6795.66s]  the side of that house you're working on. It's the demon person. It turns out that just
[6795.66s -> 6811.42s]  builder's diagrams to, Oh, telling the plumber where to put the gap for the overfill. Nevermind.
[6816.82s -> 6839.11s]  Nevermind. 80%. Is this the first job I will ever complete in this game? Especially a different
[6839.11s -> 6843.91s]  nozzle. I, I, yeah, but I like the green one. The green one is just enough pressure, but it's not
[6843.91s -> 6857.70s]  too much. This one has a good surface area, but it doesn't, it doesn't get down deep and you have
[6857.70s -> 6864.07s]  to pass through three times anyways. Hey, can you do the cat puke noise? Um, what is that?
[6864.95s -> 6873.16s]  What the, what are you talking about? I'm a sponsored fucking stream. Shut up.
[6885.22s -> 6920.33s]  That looks all right. Call for a vote. What are we voting on? This thing goes, this is the long
[6920.33s -> 6923.53s]  range nozzle. That's what's going on here. I was like, Holy shit. This is awesome.
[6924.33s -> 6933.35s]  Why did I not have someone from the very beginning? I could do the whole house like this.
[6945.78s -> 6950.92s]  That's so much. All right. This will be done in 10 minutes. Not even a poll to do cat puke. No,
[6950.92s -> 6956.95s]  that's on, that's on me. If I want to do that, whatever that is, whatever that could be,
[6957.75s -> 6962.42s]  that's something I've never heard of, whatever that is. I don't know. It's something strange.
[6962.42s -> 6992.65s]  Apparently nice. So much quicker. Come on, just get, wait, I can use the, uh, the, the spinner.
[6997.85s -> 7001.61s]  This is my favorite weapon. Well, it's not a weapon, but you know what I mean? It's my favorite
[7001.61s -> 7019.72s]  attachment. I would say I don't call it a weapon. It's not a weapon. Favorite weapon.
[7021.51s -> 7057.24s]  Got it. Plus that's two bucks. That's two bucks. Two bucks. Almost at 90%. Let's go. Let's go.
[7057.24s -> 7081.90s]  Let's go. Let's go. I was puked. Yeah. I was just, I was cat puked. You're right.
[7082.62s -> 7107.11s]  How much more of this did before I get a ding? I'm being dead serious. There it is. I get it
[7107.11s -> 7132.33s]  underneath. Ding. Looks so much better. So much better. Can we see the before and after photos?
[7133.05s -> 7138.09s]  What a difference. What a difference that made, huh? What a change. What a difference.
[7138.81s -> 7195.61s]  What a difference. What? When is this going to ding? Somebody said, why are you so tall?
[7196.78s -> 7216.04s]  Holy shit. He's huge. I just realized I'm seven plus feet tall. What? There it is.
[7216.60s -> 7221.78s]  There's the ding. By the way, can we, uh, in the chat, can we tell everybody where they can get
[7221.78s -> 7230.68s]  this power wash simulator? Where can you get it? And by the way, I got a terrible job I've done.
[7232.65s -> 7239.37s]  What an awful job I've done. Imagine if you could show me up
[7239.37s -> 7284.71s]  on your own game. Just your fucking like two year old. I'm 90% sure it's on Xbox. You're right.
[7284.71s -> 7295.42s]  Xbox X. Xbox Series S. Steam. It's on that PC of yours. I believe it's also on Game Pass.
[7295.42s -> 7299.42s]  Potentially two. We're, we have, we've got a Corob. We've got to figure that one out.
[7300.38s -> 7322.66s]  Ding. More dings. Yeah, it's on Game Pass. Yes. You just downloaded from Game Pass? Hell yeah.
[7323.30s -> 7383.27s]  260. What do I need? 375? I want a different nozzle. Oh, what did I do? You made somebody
[7383.27s -> 7388.23s]  cry. I made somebody cry at Dave and Buster's. You made my little sister cry at Dave and Buster's.
[7388.23s -> 7393.11s]  You called her crying Andy and she cried. I'm nice. Just delete this. What is this?
[7393.83s -> 7419.51s]  Do I still not? Okay, come on. There it is. All right. What is missing on this side? This
[7419.51s -> 7422.07s]  side looks good besides this. This looks awful, but you know, whatever. It's fine.
[7423.03s -> 7476.81s]  Wait, you can get this on Steam Deck? That wasn't a bad first pass. Come on. Why does it feel like
[7476.81s -> 7482.63s]  this setting? I would be like, I wouldn't be able to control this. I'd be, my arm would be moving
[7482.63s -> 7501.61s]  all. This is a lot of power behind this. Do this to your house in real life. There it is. All right.
[7501.93s -> 7529.30s]  Wait, this side too. 90%. Come on. It's just the roof. Get in there. Nice.
[7538.86s -> 7545.62s]  I haven't got a ding in a while. Kind of getting a little pissed off about it, if I'm honest.
[7545.62s -> 7577.03s]  Can you get this on a Samsung fridge? Why is there just a, I don't know. I don't know if you
[7577.03s -> 7583.50s]  can get this on a fridge. That has not been play tested. I don't think so. That's at your own risk.
[7584.06s -> 7618.25s]  It's fridge compatible. Have you, did you do it? They said it's fridge compatible. Pog.
[7618.25s -> 7625.32s]  That's not official. That's not an official statement. That's one, one guy in chat said that.
[7625.32s -> 7646.58s]  I don't know. I don't know what that means. How did I not do this already? This hedge ruined
[7646.58s -> 7667.72s]  everything. Come on. Really? All right. Oh, oh, I, that was supposed to be a joke, but that actually
[7667.72s -> 7689.03s]  just died. Did that for real. That hurt. That did that for a joke. Flatter. Now it's just the roof,
[7689.03s -> 7718.87s]  right? And that's it. Broke your finger. I'm fine. It didn't even hurt. This was blowing out my
[7718.87s -> 7728.81s]  microphone, right? Cause that was disgusting. That definitely covered it up. I just did like
[7728.81s -> 7734.47s]  this internal burp and it was like, and this, I'm glad you didn't hear it because this, yeah.
[7745.98s -> 7750.06s]  Thank God I have this loud white noise just playing in the background. So you didn't hear that.
[7761.91s -> 7792.44s]  He farted. I didn't stop saying that. What's left up here? Oh, the gutter, right? Can I hold shift
[7792.44s -> 7837.48s]  and not fall off like Minecraft? This is really, really on there. This is algae. Is that, was it
[7837.48s -> 7858.42s]  algae? Is it, it looks like, did I get it all? There's still some here. Hold on. Let me crouch.
[7858.42s -> 7877.11s]  I got it all. Oh, that's actually a really good angle for this. You're floating. No, I've got,
[7877.11s -> 7886.55s]  I'm out of the way at the end. My, my big toe is over here. I'm fine. This is a, this angle is
[7886.55s -> 7906.47s]  perfect though. You can get all up in there. Okay. There's nothing else over here. 92%. All right. I
[7906.47s -> 7939.66s]  got to get the algae in there. I already got all that. Not over here though. Hold on. Ding. No ding.
[7953.03s -> 7991.26s]  Where's the ding? No ding. Dude, no ding. No ding. Here we go. All right. I'm in. This is, yeah,
[7991.26s -> 8014.26s]  this is algae. All right. What is left besides the very top of the roof here? This, oh, that looks
[8014.26s -> 8036.71s]  bad. What, besides this, there's nothing else. There's a whole left wall. Bro, that's a shadow.
[8036.71s -> 8071.83s]  Bro, 303. Do I get, do I actually get a bonus for this? If I do, if I complete the whole thing,
[8081.10s -> 8093.56s]  you've been doing this for two hours. Yeah, I'm having fun. It gives you a message. Oh, I got it.
[8093.56s -> 8157.96s]  40 bucks. Hell yeah. Come on. I want to buy that new nozzle. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Ding. Real voice.
[8160.50s -> 8165.35s]  You know, let me, let me talk in my real voice. I'm going to talk just in my real voice. No messing
[8165.35s -> 8172.57s]  around. No like putting on a projection to talk into a microphone or talk. So this is what I just,
[8172.57s -> 8176.66s]  this is what I normally talk like. This is how I just normally speak to somebody. If I'm talking
[8176.66s -> 8181.46s]  to somebody, this is how I just normally will talk. I'll be like, what's up, man? What are you
[8181.46s -> 8187.43s]  up to? Nothing. I, you, you, are you doing that thing on a, on Friday? I was thinking about going,
[8187.43s -> 8201.24s]  but I'm not sure. Are you, um, yeah. Are you, uh, I can pick you up and pick it up at like,
[8201.24s -> 8213.03s]  like eight. No. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I mean, we can get a, we can get a breakfast if you want.
[8213.03s -> 8221.54s]  We can just get breakfast and shit. I was going to do it again, but I'm like, nah,
[8221.54s -> 8281.05s]  I'm not doing it again. 95%, 96%. It's just this side right here. That's it. 97, 98, 99. Oh,
[8281.05s -> 8346.76s]  it's coming. Come on. 99 still. 100. You thought dirt and grime could hide from me? This is where
[8346.76s -> 8352.14s]  it shows like a bunch of animated dirt and they're all hiding under the railing. He'll never get us
[8352.14s -> 8365.02s]  here. We're caked on algae. And then it blasts. Our washers use the strongest nozzles able to take
[8365.02s -> 8389.43s]  six coats of paint off. Our nozzles are so strong. We can turn steel back to its original element,
[8389.43s -> 8394.14s]  iron and copper. It splits the atoms or whatever it does. What? Wait, what is it? What is steel?
[8395.22s -> 8397.94s]  Carbon. Fuck. I fucked that whole joke up. You know what I mean though.
[8400.41s -> 8404.41s]  Iron and copper. I've been playing too many mobile games, guys. It's one bar of copper,
[8404.41s -> 8418.97s]  one bar of iron, and you put them together and it turns into steel. Window frames? Where are these
[8418.97s -> 8433.56s]  trims? Wooden trim. There it is. How do you make steel? Steel is aluminum. Okay, so what's a better
[8433.56s -> 8441.56s]  joke? I can bring a material that's combined metals down to their periodic table version.
[8445.45s -> 8452.23s]  Carbon and iron. So a better thing would be like, our nozzles are so strong. Our nozzles are so
[8452.23s -> 8473.43s]  strong. We can turn steel back into carbon and iron. Would that be better? Why did you say
[8473.43s -> 8485.40s]  copper? Why did you say carbon and iron? Split bronze into copper and tin. Did I get it wrong?
[8495.21s -> 8525.77s]  No, you were correct. Left side window. Ah, 99. I'm so stressed out. Relax. We're fine. Rail. Oh,
[8525.77s -> 8557.16s]  here we go. A nozzle like this would fuck this up. Probably. Iron and carbon is steel. Steel is
[8557.16s -> 8571.80s]  mostly iron. It's about 98% iron. All right. So I wasn't wrong. I physically can't get over here.
[8572.52s -> 8603.43s]  Hold on. Yes, I can. Another railing. More window trims. Oh, come on. Wait, that's it. All right.
[8603.43s -> 8616.66s]  Now window trim. You should say it splits atoms. Well, it's like an image of the guy shooting the
[8616.66s -> 8626.73s]  power washer. He's like, and it's just all of a sudden you see like a mushroom cloud. I don't
[8626.73s -> 8640.18s]  think I would want that. Window trim. Yeah, these were like, there's a couple windows here.
[8640.18s -> 8652.04s]  Up here. No, not this one. Wooden trim. Oh, it's not window trim. It's wooden trim.
[8658.54s -> 8690.41s]  Wooden trim and railing. Which railing? This one? There it is. Shit, I gotta go down here. I'm
[8690.41s -> 8723.58s]  almost at 100. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Only a few more. And I got 100% on the house.
[8734.14s -> 8762.58s]  Very nice. There's three more. Where? Where? Last one. Extra 100 bucks. And we gotta get our,
[8762.58s -> 8779.13s]  hold on. We gotta do our post shave rinse, right? That looks good. Get the bladder out of the way.
[8779.13s -> 8801.05s]  I want a picture. Okay. No, wait. It's your perspective. So it'd be like this. Hey. All
[8801.05s -> 8807.29s]  right. Wait, this is from a year ago. This is literally from a year ago. The front part.
[8807.29s -> 8826.31s]  It's saved for a year. Wait, hold on. It actually kept it from a year ago. Why? Hold on. But why did
[8826.31s -> 8841.64s]  I exist later? How come I was walking around? Who is this walking around? They grew up so fast.
[8841.64s -> 8856.47s]  All right. I got some money now. Let's go back to the skate park. Steel is iron. All right. Here
[8856.47s -> 8867.96s]  we go. They added a player model and a patch. Oh, that's funny. Okay. Here we go. Update the nozzle.
[8867.96s -> 8878.71s]  You think it's time? Heavy duty. $2,000. I don't have that. Five grand. All right. I'm not
[8878.71s -> 8885.56s]  fucking around anymore. I'm not messing around anymore. We need to get money. Let's go. Ready?
[8889.91s -> 8894.62s]  Um, I need, I need some, I need some, I need some go fast music.
[8896.66s -> 8904.04s]  Multipurpose. I'm going to soak the whole thing. You ready? No, not doom. OST. Something that is
[8904.04s -> 8915.53s]  royalty free. It's gotta be something royalty free. Is penis music royalty free? Definitely not. I
[8915.53s -> 8925.45s]  don't know why. That's what I wanted to put on here. Put on Sonic X. Is that so? I mean,
[8925.45s -> 8941.94s]  it's video game music, right? Whatever. Put on the Flintstones SNES. All right. Hold on. Let me,
[8941.94s -> 8956.44s]  let me get something. Let's do, um, what do you think? No, not break core. Why would Sonic
[8956.44s -> 8968.18s]  doesn't make sense? Put on the one Sonic song and just put it on repeat. Flintstones SNES. I'm so,
[8968.42s -> 8977.94s]  what, I'm curious of what this is. What is this Flintstones SNES? OST. I've never played this
[8977.94s -> 8991.56s]  game before. Flintstones? By the way, this is the movie version of the Flintstones.
[8995.19s -> 9001.58s]  Holy shit. This is a fucking awesome. What the hell? Who made this? This is great.
[9010.17s -> 9018.10s]  Oh, hold on. Let's start this over. When you meet the Flintstones, your own new story.
[9018.10s -> 9039.02s]  Let's do that one more time. This just blows it out. Hold on. The skin on my mouth is coming off.
[9050.58s -> 9058.57s]  Why am I doing this? No, let's go over here. I need soap. What just happened?
[9059.13s -> 9067.10s]  This sounds like a really shitty version of this because of the white noise.
[9067.10s -> 9087.85s]  How long are they gonna hold? I can hold the will before.
[9136.63s -> 9146.68s]  Fucking long, dude. How long was that? That was at least like 30 seconds.
[9150.41s -> 9159.35s]  That had to have been at least 20 to 30 seconds. That was a flash. You flash banged us.
[9165.18s -> 9179.66s]  Is this Fred Flintstone? Dude, did I get the longest Wilma world record right there?
[9184.82s -> 9199.43s]  All right. I want to buy the soap. Multi-purpose. This song is amazing.
[9207.59s -> 9220.14s]  Shit. I'm spending money. That was like a minute. That was 45 seconds.
[9225.80s -> 9255.86s]  What? Based on the clip, that was 45 straight seconds. Do I submit that somewhere? All right.
[9255.86s -> 9264.57s]  I don't want wood cleaner. I want multi-purpose cleaner. The soundtrack is actually really good.
[9264.57s -> 9273.58s]  All right. I'm gonna start. Let's get this whole quadrant done like from here to here.
[9273.58s -> 9298.44s]  I'm gonna draw a line essentially. So from here to here. Ready? This OST fucks. It does. Hey,
[9298.44s -> 9311.86s]  we're playing Power War Simulator. Check it out. This actually cleans it really well.
[9311.86s -> 9335.80s]  Multi-purpose still, right? Yep. Oh, that's a dirty steak. I want to check out some of
[9335.80s -> 9338.71s]  the other little modes too. There's a couple of the modes I want to see.
[9338.71s -> 9349.56s]  Okay. After the skate park, I'll check out some of the other modes. I'm actually going to really
[9349.56s -> 9363.94s]  try to get this done quickly. Quadrant by quadrant. I don't want to go too far. I'm going too far now.
[9363.94s -> 9375.19s]  Already is looking way better. Right here. There's the line right here. We're going to
[9375.19s -> 9386.58s]  go over this again with the actual nozzle. And from this line, I'm going to draw the line here.
[9386.58s -> 9396.46s]  Ready? Okay. Do not cross this line. If I cross that line before doing the rest of it, right?
[9396.46s -> 9404.89s]  I'm going to do it right here. Let's make, let's draw it. See? In here. If I start going over that
[9404.89s -> 9421.46s]  line and I like, oh yes, let me tell you a story. So, um, I'm in trouble. Quadrant by quadrant.
[9421.46s -> 9450.98s]  Nothing else. I'm good. I'm not over the line. This, the line is right at the edge of this wall.
[9450.98s -> 9459.43s]  I'm going to leave a little bit of dirt so I don't, uh, so I can see where the line is still.
[9472.84s -> 9482.01s]  Okay. That's all right right now. Let's get this edge over here. And as fast as you can say,
[9482.01s -> 9499.48s]  bops your uncle, boppies your aunt, I have a delicious virgin strawberry daiquiri. All right.
[9499.48s -> 9522.09s]  This one's good. Now we're going to go in the corner. Perfect. Minus two. Stop immediately.
[9523.66s -> 9544.06s]  No, I don't think I will. Actually, yeah, I will. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Don't miss anything. Just
[9544.06s -> 9551.27s]  go slow. If you take your time, you don't have to spend more time added on top, going back and
[9551.27s -> 9558.18s]  doing this again. If you spend the extra time to make sure it's done now, you don't have to come
[9558.18s -> 9582.26s]  back and do it again. Efficiency. Don't steal that joke. There's a bunch of, there's a shit
[9582.26s -> 9587.78s]  load of people here that don't know me really. Hey, did you guys know? Don't steal that joke.
[9587.78s -> 9594.82s]  I'm going to do it. Did you guys know that every day you eat over an inch of dirt every meal,
[9595.62s -> 9604.20s]  every single day? Isn't that insane? Did you know that? You eat over an inch of dirt every single
[9604.20s -> 9609.56s]  day. It's crazy. Isn't that like kind of gross? It's that's a weird statistic. Don't you think
[9615.66s -> 9618.54s]  speak for yourself? No, everybody does it. We all do. Every single person
[9619.02s -> 9628.54s]  eats over an inch of dirt a day. I mean, you got to be sitting at a table. You got to be at
[9628.54s -> 9658.70s]  least a few inches off the ground eating that food, don't you? What's the joke? That is the joke.
[9659.42s -> 9687.58s]  We're not listening. I don't get it. I'm not outside the line. This is, look, the line's right
[9687.58s -> 9710.62s]  there. You clown. The line's right here. See? Hot, hot, hot, hot. Somebody wrote in all caps,
[9710.62s -> 9715.42s]  what are you talking about? I don't know how it was. Is it really this hard to follow this
[9715.42s -> 9726.95s]  conversation? Sometimes I feel like you guys act like you're changing channels. Like,
[9728.55s -> 9747.27s]  and then here we are. We got. All right. I'm focusing on this railing and I'm going to make
[9747.27s -> 9775.46s]  sure it's done well. Play with the ball. I can't leave. I can't cross that. I cannot cross that
[9775.46s -> 9797.90s]  line. Not until everything here is clean. Can't do it. Do I turn the music up? Turn the music up.
[9797.90s -> 9803.53s]  I'll turn everything. I'll turn everything up. That goes up a little and the wash sounds would
[9803.53s -> 9841.42s]  go up a little too. A little up. A little up. That's fine. You need to do a monkey impression.
[9841.42s -> 9873.88s]  Why? For what? All right. This railing's almost done. Am I going to get dinged for the railing
[9873.88s -> 9887.94s]  or is this not a ding? Is this not a dingable object? There it is. Okay. Don't leave the line.
[9887.94s -> 9908.09s]  Do it because you love us. Where did you get that idea? This is still in the line. The line ends
[9908.09s -> 9915.03s]  over there. I'm not going to do a monkey sound. Oh, okay. You're hearing it. That looks good up
[9915.03s -> 9940.01s]  there so far. All right. That's good. Now I'm just going to do the stairs and that should take this
[9940.01s -> 9955.98s]  whole wall down. By the way, Power Wash Simulator is currently in 1.0. Just released into 1.0 today.
[9958.09s -> 9962.60s]  After a while in early access. It's available for you to download right now.
[9963.16s -> 9968.10s]  Free to go get it on various platforms. It's driven today's sponsor, of course.
[9968.74s -> 9990.07s]  We laugh at all your dumb jokes but you won't even do a monkey sound. Don't you think that is a dumb
[9990.07s -> 10001.22s]  joke? If I were to just start doing a chimpanzee sound effect, that's dumb. Why would I be doing
[10001.22s -> 10026.58s]  that? What's my motivation? Direct me. What's the motivation? Not bad because you've done it before.
[10030.79s -> 10055.62s]  I love this half pipe. I love the watermelon. Dude, if I owned this park, they would be a
[10055.62s -> 10061.93s]  watermelon scented plug-in or something or watermelon scented spray that we sprayed
[10061.93s -> 10070.60s]  all around the place and then open the park. People would come over here and be like,
[10071.66s -> 10093.48s]  what? Oh my, dude, it's watermelons. It would be awesome. I gotta slow it down. This song is good.
[10094.04s -> 10106.44s]  Who recommended this? Because it's actually fantastic. Should I play the Flintstones SNES
[10106.44s -> 10160.52s]  game? Sure. It's probably gonna ding here in a minute. Oh, that was a good line. Come on,
[10160.52s -> 10189.02s]  let's see it ding. Ding. Ding. Let's see it ding. This mold on the wall? Yeah, I know but I'm doing
[10189.02s -> 10203.64s]  the pool. Whatever this thing is. Yes. All right, that's done. This wall over here now. All right,
[10204.36s -> 10217.94s]  don't freak out. I think I can go wider here. Yeah, here it is. Yeah, it's the Flintstones SNES
[10217.94s -> 10255.70s]  soundtrack. No monkey, no buy. So what you're implying that if I do a monkey sound, you will
[10255.70s -> 10272.25s]  buy this game. Powerwatch simulator available on Xbox S, Xbox X, Steam, Game Pass. So that's what
[10272.25s -> 10294.89s]  you're saying? Liars. You should be getting the game because it's a quality fun game with really,
[10294.89s -> 10299.69s]  really, don't look at my lips. I just spit out something weird. It was gross. It was disgusting,
[10299.69s -> 10304.73s]  whatever that was. You should be buying this game because it's a fun relaxing simulator of washing
[10305.37s -> 10312.06s]  stuff. That's what you should be doing. It was a piece of spaghetti.
[10315.22s -> 10321.05s]  How would you have spaghetti stuck in your teeth? That's not, it's pasta. It's impossible.
[10322.62s -> 10329.62s]  You don't have spaghetti stuck in your teeth. That will disintegrate over time. Not like a piece of
[10329.62s -> 10372.20s]  broccoli. That's that whole wall, I think. All the tops, the tops of this, right? Yep. I know
[10372.20s -> 10399.32s]  that we have to be perfect with this. We'll get the ding. Shit. Madden, you saw this in real life?
[10401.61s -> 10422.54s]  Is somebody power washing a park? I don't think that's that abnormal. Anything else on this?
[10423.10s -> 10435.05s]  Yeah, here. What is this? I just made shrimp grits in your honor. I mean,
[10435.69s -> 10438.65s]  hopefully it's good. I don't really like shrimp that much and I don't really like grits,
[10439.98s -> 10456.89s]  but I hope it's good. I know a lot of people like it. Ungrateful, he made it for you. I'm not eating
[10456.89s -> 10482.55s]  it. I have nothing to do with this. Ungrateful. All right, our strategy is working pretty well.
[10485.45s -> 10502.26s]  Look at that. We're almost a tenth of the way there. I just said, I'm sure it's good. You could
[10502.26s -> 10510.28s]  be the most talented pizza crafter in the world. If somebody doesn't like pizza, they're not going
[10510.28s -> 10517.50s]  to really want to eat pizza. That doesn't mean that you don't have a very delicious dish in front of
[10517.50s -> 10549.02s]  you. You really might. I'm sure it's good. What's that term? Bad pizza is still good pizza? No,
[10549.02s -> 10576.20s]  it isn't. No, it's not. Bad pizza is gross. Bad pizza is like sex. It's still sex, right?
[10577.00s -> 10580.20s]  Then they take the grease and they put droplets of grease in their eyes.
[10588.98s -> 10592.58s]  I mean, how in the heck do you make a slope out of concrete? I don't know. You shape it.
[10605.03s -> 10615.90s]  I actually eat junky pizza all the time. I actually love shitty pizza, so please
[10615.90s -> 10625.62s]  do not take this joke as reality. Still though, sometimes you get a pizza that sucks so bad
[10626.78s -> 10656.41s]  and everyone's just like, well, who cares? It was still $18. Who pays $18 for pizza?
[10658.57s -> 10683.18s]  A large pizzas are usually more than $15. I get a large pizza. I don't get a small. $18. Yeah,
[10683.18s -> 10698.65s]  what do you mean $18? That's pretty normal. Did I cross the line? No. All right. Are we good here?
[10698.65s -> 10714.25s]  Take a look at that. It's almost perfect. Chad, he's not eating it alone. I mean, I've seen
[10714.25s -> 10722.30s]  people crush a large pizza before and I'm just like, holy shit. Dude, let's be real.
[10723.34s -> 10729.42s]  I'm telling you right now, I have absolutely gotten really damn close to eating an entire
[10729.42s -> 10735.96s]  large cheese pizza by myself and I could have done it, but there's two more slices left in the box
[10735.96s -> 10743.40s]  and you look at it and you just kind of go, that would be bad. That already is bad, right? That's
[10743.40s -> 10748.94s]  already bad. If there's two or three slices left in the box and you're the only one eating it,
[10750.54s -> 10761.16s]  it's let's box it up and put it in the fridge, right? Like somebody said he's talking about
[10761.16s -> 10767.99s]  sex on a sponsor's treat. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. The sponsor was only for a little bit.
[10767.99s -> 10771.99s]  I'm just still playing the game. I want to support the game. I think it's a great game.
[10774.78s -> 10781.02s]  The sponsor segment has ended. We're just playing Power Wash Simulator because I think it's a great
[10781.02s -> 10795.05s]  game, which by the way, where can you get it? I'd like to see it in the chat, please. Where's my...
[10795.05s -> 10811.62s]  There it is. I didn't even talk. I made one small offhanded comment about people's opinions on pizza
[10811.62s -> 10830.02s]  and did nothing. I didn't talk about whatever. All right. We are good. It's time to make a new
[10830.02s -> 10846.63s]  line. You ready? Let's just do it. Let's make it easy to the bench. Like right here. Don't cross
[10846.63s -> 10874.92s]  that line. Probably should just switch to the... I don't anymore. So we'll do first pass. You sound
[10874.92s -> 10911.80s]  like the radio guy from PT. Hello. Hello. Hello. All right. That's pass number one. I need the
[10911.80s -> 10923.93s]  stronger nozzle here. I'll go over it again. That's the phone guy. You should have minus twoed that.
[10923.93s -> 10932.66s]  You had an opportunity. All of you that just weren't sure if you should have hit minus two,
[10932.66s -> 10940.17s]  you should have. I'm telling you, you should have done that. And now it's too late because now you
[10940.17s -> 10963.50s]  look like you're doing it because I said it. This is on there. Ooh, family from the town of
[10963.50s -> 10976.89s]  Rock. They're the modern Stone Age family. When you meet the Flintstones.
[10994.10s -> 11031.78s]  I'm just kidding. This sound effect, the Super Nintendo wind sound effect that was in everything.
[11036.01s -> 11043.24s]  This sound is so scary. It's such a strange thing. It always gives me some kind of... It makes me feel
[11043.24s -> 11056.49s]  a certain way. This is an undertale. What's wrong with you? Seriously? Oh, yeah. I get that
[11056.49s -> 11062.39s]  question a lot, but I don't even know what that... What do you mean? I'm just sitting here and just
[11062.39s -> 11068.46s]  talking nonsense, just hanging out. Some of you guys act like I eat like bugs after the stream's
[11068.46s -> 11077.75s]  over. I just kind of hang out. I do my thing. For some reason, I think a lot of you guys think I
[11077.75s -> 11081.99s]  do. Oh, yeah. Oh, here it is. My dinner. Oh, a whole plate of cockroaches. That doesn't happen.
[11081.99s -> 11111.90s]  I'm just a regular guy. I'm just a normal person. Yeah. Hey, I get high and watch the same TV shows
[11111.90s -> 11139.83s]  you do. Oh, dude, I think he eats bugs. No, I don't. In fact, I'm one of those people that...
[11139.83s -> 11149.26s]  You know the... Oh, look. It's the bug in the popsicle novelty item. I would never eat that.
[11149.26s -> 11155.03s]  I don't want that. I would never eat one of those. People always point to a tweet that I made in like
[11155.03s -> 11161.27s]  2013 where I made a joke tweet about eating... I mean, I swallowed a bug and it was like, okay,
[11161.27s -> 11165.19s]  that was weird. I should tweet about it. And I'm like, oh, it's the greatest thing I've ever tasted.
[11165.19s -> 11170.15s]  What do I do about this? It was clearly a joke tweet from like 2012. I had people point to that
[11170.15s -> 11191.67s]  and they're like, well, he's fucking crazy. But you know what I'm talking about? They're in the
[11191.67s -> 11199.18s]  kind of golden, almost like amber. I wouldn't eat one of those. There's usually a worm in it
[11199.98s -> 11217.21s]  or sometimes just some kind of other scary bug in it. No, no. Just give me the lollipop.
[11217.21s -> 11226.44s]  Why do you have... Why does it have to be a bug inside of it? Right? That golden kind of amber
[11226.44s -> 11240.60s]  lollipop. Can I just have that? I don't want the bug inside of it because I feel like that
[11240.60s -> 11253.82s]  actually tastes good. Whatever that is. But I don't want the gross bug residue on it.
[11253.82s -> 11273.13s]  Stop eating valuable rocks. Those are not lollipops. I find like these ancient stones
[11273.13s -> 11281.58s]  in the ground. I don't understand why people eat these. I don't get it. No, dude, that's a million
[11281.58s -> 11313.13s]  year old fossil. Don't put that in your mouth. It tastes really sweet. There we go. Did the bug
[11313.13s -> 11340.38s]  taste good though? No, it was... You're the only person that makes me laugh out loud.
[11342.42s -> 11377.66s]  That's actually makes me happy. I'm dead serious. Gotta laugh sometimes, right? Will you eat bugs
[11377.66s -> 11398.54s]  for the fans? No. No. I gotta get up on top of the railing. Would you eat a bug for the haters? No.
[11398.54s -> 11405.32s]  I'm not eating any bugs. Then that's where that conversation ends. I'm not gonna eat bugs for the
[11405.32s -> 11413.53s]  haters. Bugs for the fans. I'm not eating bugs. I wouldn't eat bugs if my... If like my mother asked
[11413.53s -> 11435.32s]  me to. Talk about my biggest fan. Eat bugs for mom. I'm not eating... Nobody... I'm not... I wouldn't
[11435.32s -> 11454.10s]  eat bugs for anybody. What about a doctor? I would feel like I was getting pranked. What do
[11454.10s -> 11460.74s]  you mean? The doctor comes into the office and he's like, oh Jeremy, okay, you have a headache
[11461.46s -> 11467.86s]  and it's time I can cure that for you. You have to eat four cockroaches in front of me while I hold
[11467.86s -> 11476.07s]  up a fucking cell phone with TikTok open. What do you mean by that? Like, is there actual
[11476.07s -> 11498.89s]  scientific evidence that this works? Okay, if it was true and there was a data, a trial or a study,
[11498.89s -> 11502.57s]  and it was passed, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever, FDA, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[11503.21s -> 11506.81s]  If this actually worked and it was for a thing that I wanted to get like cured, get rid of or
[11506.81s -> 11512.36s]  something. Dude, you know, that like chest and back problem I've had for like four years,
[11513.94s -> 11519.62s]  if the doctor came in and was like, Jeremy, uh, you know, that kind of like center chest like pain
[11519.62s -> 11523.54s]  that's really kind of fucking up your life last four years. Uh, if you eat this whole
[11523.54s -> 11531.83s]  bowl of cockroaches, it'll go away. And he said, here's the study. That bowl will be gone in 15
[11531.83s -> 11548.06s]  seconds. So I guess, I guess there is, I guess there is a place where I would do it. But no,
[11548.06s -> 11558.04s]  if he just kind of came in and was like, oh, hey, I'm a doctor. Eat bugs. He just opens the door.
[11558.04s -> 11564.81s]  Hey, I'm a doctor. Eat these bugs and puts them down and closes the door. I'm not going to do that.
[11570.25s -> 11576.68s]  I don't, I wouldn't do that. What if he ate them in front of you first? I don't care. That's all,
[11576.68s -> 11579.96s]  that's the, that's the, whatever weird shit he's doing. I have nothing to do with that.
[11582.81s -> 11586.57s]  So he comes in the room and he's just like, okay, so we took a look at your blood work
[11587.37s -> 11593.35s]  and he's just, he's just eating them out of his pocket. Yeah. Your, uh, your, your, uh, HDL
[11593.35s -> 11599.67s]  cholesterol is a little high. Uh, your LDL is okay, but you know, and then he goes like this
[11599.67s -> 11606.87s]  after talking about my blood results. I don't know. What does the doctor look like?
[11609.16s -> 11620.01s]  Is he like six feet tall, like 200, lean cut? Is it how, what does he look like? Does he have
[11620.97s -> 11638.39s]  completely blemish free skin? Does he have flowing hair? And it comes up with his license
[11638.39s -> 11645.19s]  and he's like, look, 60, 60. And it's, and he looks fucking amazing. I don't know. Maybe
[11645.19s -> 11663.96s]  I'd have to think about it. All right, that's done. All right. Plan worked. Dude, why do you
[11663.96s -> 11671.40s]  only listen to handsome doctors? No, I didn't say handsome. When did I say handsome? I said he was
[11671.40s -> 11679.83s]  like cut up, jacked, healthy, blemish free, flowing hair. He's looks like he's, he's me and
[11679.83s -> 11685.27s]  he moves in a full stride. You know what I mean? I never said, wow, look at how handsome this doctor
[11685.27s -> 11750.23s]  is. How healthy does he look? Oh, you guys are fucking hilarious. Okay. So fine. Sorry.
[11750.79s -> 11762.06s]  So this wicked handsome doctor walks in. Okay. Now, what do you want me to say? Who gives a shit?
[11764.12s -> 11772.28s]  He looks healthy. He's, he's, he's clean. He's clean shaven. He's, he's going like this,
[11776.76s -> 11783.29s]  like that. And he's postures like this. And he's got the clipboard up here.
[11786.23s -> 11803.46s]  He's got big hair and he's so fit. He just got done cycling and he's got cycling shorts on
[11803.46s -> 11827.24s]  and a lab coat. Stop sharing your fantasy. So, so my fantasy is this wicked handsome doctor
[11827.24s -> 11834.92s]  in bike shorts comes in and we eat bugs together and have a romantic relationship of some kind.
[11836.50s -> 11864.41s]  This is what you think my fantasy of mine is. Sounds about right.
[11870.94s -> 11875.74s]  Hold on. You're missing an incredibly important detail. He rides his bike down the hall
[11875.74s -> 11881.85s]  of the doctor's office. You know, the door is open. I can see out into the hallway and he's,
[11881.85s -> 11887.61s]  he just slowly pulls up on his bike. It's a huge mountain bike and he gets off and kickstand goes
[11887.61s -> 11895.26s]  up and then he comes in. Right. That's perfect. And he's still got, he's got, he's got the helmet
[11895.26s -> 11921.78s]  on. It's a big manly bike. He takes the bike helmet off and his hair is flowing.
[11934.81s -> 11943.24s]  All right. This looks good. I need a new line, a real man sized bike. All right. New line is
[11943.24s -> 11982.74s]  right here. Don't cross that. Hey, you want, you want to eat some bugs, man? Would you eat the bugs
[11982.74s -> 11990.52s]  in Jerma's fantasy scenario? I doubt it. I doubt, uh, yeah, no way. It's going to be mostly nos.
[11995.32s -> 12010.38s]  Don't, this is not, don't call it my fantasy scenario. This fucking music.
[12025.58s -> 12037.11s]  What is playing right now? Why is this playing? Why are we getting this fucking romance music?
[12050.42s -> 12058.07s]  Just got, just got done with a quick bike ride. Kickstand comes in. Just like sweat,
[12058.07s -> 12067.29s]  just glistening off his forehead. So what brings you in today? Well, I have a little
[12067.29s -> 12073.46s]  bit of a headache. Uh, it's kind of like a migraine as kind of deal I got going on here.
[12074.02s -> 12079.43s]  One second takes the bike helmet off and just hair. It's a fucking, it's, it's like at least
[12079.43s -> 12093.85s]  16 to 20 inches here. It pulls up the license 60 by the way. And I'm like, Oh wow. Look at that
[12093.85s -> 12098.50s]  crazy thing. That's why you got that. What a head of hair. Yeah. I haven't had a headache,
[12098.50s -> 12123.61s]  by the way, in a long time, different music. You want to eat some bugs. The music changed
[12123.61s -> 12138.33s]  and changed everything. This is bug music now. Why is this music perfect for all this going on?
[12138.97s -> 12158.28s]  What the fuck is happening? Why this is forget it, forget it. What even sound this auto played
[12159.82s -> 12164.54s]  water world for super Nintendo. Just started auto playing after Flintstones.
[12164.54s -> 12174.62s]  I went five and a half minutes into this. Stop. No, stop it. I'm getting on cam. I'm getting,
[12174.62s -> 12218.14s]  I'm getting out of here. I'm gone. Put on block. I'm back. This music. All right. What's this one?
[12221.50s -> 12240.22s]  What's solstice title screen theme? What the hell? I did not expect that.
[12269.75s -> 12282.73s]  Oh shit. This is good. Who put this in there? Who put this in the chat? This is VR Josh. This is
[12282.73s -> 12312.30s]  lightning good. Dude, this is lightning good. This is called solstice music.
[12314.30s -> 12329.91s]  Title screen theme by Tim Fallon. Holy shit. This is crazy. Tim Fallon also did pluck.
[12330.79s -> 12341.29s]  Oh, all right. That makes sense. Was that new line? Yeah. Here. Okay.
[12342.62s -> 12360.70s]  Silver surfer. Shit. All right. That's awesome. The game was absolute blast. No, the game was ass.
[12361.42s -> 12365.98s]  Let me read that correct. The game was absolute ass, but the music slapped. Okay.
[12367.10s -> 12412.09s]  That was insane. Oh, somebody can somebody take ad out of the title
[12412.09s -> 12414.97s]  because we're technically not. This is not an ad anymore.
[12432.46s -> 12465.06s]  Let me hear a service. I can't even say that word. Damn. You know, it's wild to think about
[12465.06s -> 12474.33s]  this kind of stuff with the tools that are available now. I wonder what some of these
[12474.33s -> 12478.73s]  guys could have come up with, right? Some of them are still in the industry, right?
[12482.65s -> 12485.77s]  But this is what they had to work with back then and listen to this.
[12494.74s -> 12499.14s]  People still do it. Oh yeah. But I'm just talking about back a long time ago when this is you
[12499.14s -> 12505.03s]  couldn't do anything else with this. I wonder if whatever tools they had, if you gave them even
[12505.03s -> 12523.78s]  more tools, normal music existed. But I'm talking about the, you got me. You got me
[12523.78s -> 12540.33s]  because that was dumb. I look, I worded that wrong though. Like if they could have done this
[12540.33s -> 12544.09s]  with an actual orchestra or, and it could have gone on a CD or something, right?
[12547.53s -> 12558.84s]  If they had the tools now back then to put it onto the cartridge orchestras existed. I'm not,
[12558.84s -> 12568.34s]  I'm saying, look, I'm saying that if they could put more data on a disc, what would they have done
[12568.34s -> 12584.42s]  with the data? What would Silver Surfer theme song have sounded like? Would he have changed anything?
[12585.06s -> 12620.47s]  Just do a tie on bug juices. He did the music for echo the dolphin. That was sick. What did
[12620.47s -> 12647.88s]  let's do another echo the dolphin. Did he do echo the dolphin? Oh, that's all Tim fallen. Okay.
[12648.52s -> 12678.71s]  The playlist from earlier. I held the Wilma way longer than that. So this is the whole playlist.
[12678.71s -> 12688.46s]  What is, what is this? Oh, that's not it. Okay. So what's in, what's the next in playlist?
[12688.46s -> 12706.06s]  This is the whole Tim fallen playlist. Let's go. All right. That's good. That's a good volume.
[12711.03s -> 12717.88s]  All right. Let's go put on block. I've listened to block a lot of times.
[12727.66s -> 12730.22s]  Did this guy do the original NES Ninja Turtles?
[12730.70s -> 12741.90s]  No. Okay. Kind of sounds similar. Like it could be similar. Somebody said, yes, you're the only
[12741.90s -> 12750.04s]  person that said yes. Why? So if you're wondering how much content is in this game, I've played
[12750.04s -> 12775.98s]  this two different times now. Galaga. I played it for like six or seven, five or six hours before
[12775.98s -> 12779.58s]  about three, four hours. Now there's at least, there's a lot of content in the game.
[12780.70s -> 12788.31s]  There's a lot of just to do, just to chill in flight. You already know that. But what is
[12788.31s -> 12798.10s]  you don't know is that it could be on the Xbox one Xbox. Wait, is that might be wrong?
[12798.10s -> 12802.81s]  But it's all right. The ads gone now. I'm not doing an ad anymore. So it could be on that.
[12821.62s -> 12845.19s]  Can I get this with the, this one here? Yeah. The command is still there. That's okay.
[12845.19s -> 12863.21s]  They probably just shouldn't be in the title anymore. Do the boss theme for, for flock.
[12863.21s -> 12874.76s]  I'll put flock on after this. Oh, that is still there. Hold on. I'm gonna go harder.
[12875.32s -> 12938.70s]  I'm at 37% right now. Is it better with the sound off? You want the sound on? I feel like
[12938.70s -> 12952.44s]  it's just kind of in the background. Keep the sound on, sound off or sound on.
[12955.82s -> 12967.22s]  RT game, RT game of the raid. What's up, RT? RT, you did this in real life. How was that experience?
[12967.22s -> 12979.70s]  Yeah. Thanks for the raid. Welcome. Playing power washer simulator. If you guys don't know,
[12979.70s -> 12986.02s]  RT did this in real life. He did a power washer stream where he power washed shit in real life.
[12986.66s -> 13003.51s]  Hope you had a good stream. Welcome everybody. Always a pleasure to see, uh, RT. You're just
[13003.51s -> 13009.45s]  doing work in a video game. Yeah. But then we'll listen to the fucking chip tunes while we're at
[13009.45s -> 13020.18s]  it. You can do that as well. Do I have to, do I have to explain myself? The most time I have on
[13020.18s -> 13024.82s]  stream in a video game is a game where you clean houses. Um, so I don't know. I just, I like these
[13024.82s -> 13040.60s]  games. I like this kind of stuff. I don't know. I just do. I heard this one already, but whatever.
[13040.60s -> 13065.77s]  What do you want to do? Don't explain yourself. You're going to make it worse. All right. I'm
[13065.77s -> 13071.91s]  up. This isn't, this is looking good. This is actually looking pretty good. No, there's no
[13071.91s -> 13076.07s]  raid song. Guys, we don't do raid songs. I, all right. I, it's time to put my foot down.
[13077.19s -> 13086.28s]  The raid song has not been a funny joke since 2018. I cease this. Cease this immediately.
[13089.51s -> 13121.85s]  Cease this immediately. Oh, yuck. What the hell? Can I not stand up there? Can I not walk up here?
[13124.01s -> 13147.06s]  Sorry. Maybe I can get the ding from here. It's going to be close. So many shit stains.
[13148.12s -> 13167.93s]  That'd be weird if that was at a skate park. I got to help. Heck of a filthy sidecar. If you can
[13167.93s -> 13171.69s]  fit us in, I can run it up to you if that helps. Wait, you'll deliver it here and I'll do it.
[13172.41s -> 13178.58s]  There's one thing I know about concrete is that it likes to be as flat as possible. What's going on?
[13179.22s -> 13209.50s]  Why is that blinking over there? Because that's the quest. I don't have to do that immediately,
[13209.50s -> 13252.15s]  right? I can do it whenever I want. Now, now, hurry. All right. Sorry, one guy. I'm doing it later.
[13282.50s -> 13300.22s]  All right. These rails. Good. Oh, the gate too. This like fence here. You know what sound that
[13300.22s -> 13309.50s]  makes too. It's like I love that sound. That's like one of my favorite sounds is a power washer
[13309.50s -> 13381.99s]  kind of hitting a grate like this. Yep. This is like a 10 hour version of this song. This is looped
[13381.99s -> 13401.56s]  four times. Has it? Oh, it's almost over. Oh, it's from the ladder. What's next? I don't even
[13401.56s -> 13423.48s]  know. I don't know what this is, but it sounds good. Does this work? Oh, I can. That's not that
[13423.48s -> 13444.82s]  high though. It shouldn't be the few more steps. You're going to fail the quest. I'm fine. Section
[13444.82s -> 13484.39s]  is almost done. Beautiful. Beautiful. I'm not even halfway. Holy shit. All right. I'll be good.
[13490.54s -> 13496.14s]  Wait, what? No, I'm not there yet. I thought somebody said I hit a million followers.
[13496.14s -> 13512.10s]  I was like, oh, wow. Almost there. Yeah, almost. I'm going to take a screenshot. Just play among
[13512.10s -> 13518.73s]  us for 10 minutes and you'll do it. Now I want it to be natural. I want it to be natural. I don't
[13518.73s -> 13552.74s]  want to just have it be like a, let's go. I'm supposed to get up there. That's that unfollowed.
[13552.74s -> 13560.78s]  Don't do that. Okay. Did I complete everything over here? All right. We're going to take a break
[13560.78s -> 13576.87s]  from that. Let's go to, uh, we'll put on flock. Wait, Spider-Man and the X-Men. Really? I remember
[13576.87s -> 13598.90s]  this. I didn't. Wow. This guy did everything. Yep. All right. So now I can make a new line. New line
[13598.90s -> 13610.17s]  is here. Let's say from here to here from this, like right here, let's just go to the edge of
[13610.17s -> 13623.08s]  here. Yeah. All right. That's good. New line. Oh, you know, let's make it easy there. All right.
[13623.08s -> 13648.58s]  New line. Let's go. You can still kind of hear this. What's next? Is this the same song? Guys,
[13649.56s -> 13672.04s]  I got a better idea. I want to play the maximum carnage. OST. This is a good one.
[13672.68s -> 13686.90s]  All right. You got to guess my favorite song on this album. Put it louder. All right. You got
[13686.90s -> 13710.47s]  to guess my favorite song on the album. It's not this one. I'll let you know when it comes on.
[13711.11s -> 13776.02s]  That is the title theme, right? I believe it is maximum carnage. I feel like weird right now.
[13776.02s -> 13780.89s]  I'm just sitting here going like, yeah, while I'm power washing a wall, listen to maximum carnage.
[13786.63s -> 13799.18s]  Yep. This one's good. Do you guys know that venom is a good guy in this game?
[13799.90s -> 13803.98s]  Did you know that venom is a good character and he's a good guy and he's an antihero?
[13805.91s -> 13829.85s]  Don't ever say the venom is a bad guy. He's not a bad guy. He's an antihero. It's good.
[13829.85s -> 13850.57s]  Morbius is that now. No more. Nevermind. Where's my stool? And no, this one's good too, but it's not
[13850.57s -> 13890.20s]  my favorite one. This one's actually pretty banging. Yep. Mod chat's got it. Dr. Clay's got it.
[13890.20s -> 13905.98s]  No spoilers, no leaking. Morbius is in this game? Wait, Morbius is in the game as what?
[13905.98s -> 13918.84s]  Is he one of the summons? I don't mean like who does the actor Morbius play as. I'm saying what
[13918.84s -> 13934.76s]  does he do? Is he a boss or is he one of the summons? Because there's five or six summons.
[13934.76s -> 13941.42s]  Can't you summon Captain America in that game? In maximum carnage? Yeah. No, you can summon
[13941.42s -> 13949.14s]  Captain America. He comes out and throws a shield at somebody. So he's a summon. Yeah, he is a
[13949.14s -> 13964.49s]  summon. All right. Who is he in the game? That's so stupid. Yeah, who does the actor Morbius play
[13964.49s -> 13974.70s]  in maximum carnage for the Super Nintendo? Not this one. Where's that line? Wait, hold on.
[13982.58s -> 13986.50s]  Some of you will get that. Some of you will. Some of you will. I will just unlock a fucking
[13986.50s -> 13996.90s]  memory and you'll be like, holy shit, you unlocked an entire memory. I'm glad I just
[13996.90s -> 14010.66s]  unlocked that memory for you. That's when you first hear this song and you first hear that noise.
[14011.38s -> 14044.25s]  You just woke up sleeper agents. Like I never played video games before. By the way, I want
[14044.25s -> 14047.77s]  to make sure you turn your volume down a little. When my favorite song comes on, it's going at
[14047.77s -> 14063.77s]  maximum as high as the volume can go on my OBS. That's not true. I won't do that to you. All right,
[14063.77s -> 14072.31s]  right to this lump here. This kind of sounds like the thing that Beavis and Butthead do.
[14076.22s -> 14125.66s]  They put their hands up. This is like a midi version of that. Oh, wow. Right here is
[14127.18s -> 14131.98s]  like carnage always hit me with the axe arm and it always just pissed me off right there,
[14131.98s -> 14173.26s]  right when the music stopped. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time that I turn this
[14173.26s -> 14188.36s]  shit way the fuck up. It's getting there. We're getting close. One more Beavis and Butthead
[14190.22s -> 14218.38s]  and then after that, I think it's time to turn it up. Here it comes. It's definitely right here.
[14218.38s -> 14248.30s]  Turn it up. You guys don't know this is a, this is literally just the mob rules. Black Sabbath
[14248.30s -> 14296.92s]  song. Oh, the line. Oops. Sorry. All right. So hold on. Right. Right. I know DMCA, but still.
[14296.92s -> 14308.54s]  So you hear that, right? You hear that one. Let's put a DMCA, whatever. That's an ad.
[14308.54s -> 14367.19s]  All right. You ready? So hear that. So now it's literally the same exact song.
[14375.48s -> 14387.75s]  It's the exact same song. Hey, this one's DMCA safe. Spider-Man wrote this one. This one,
[14387.75s -> 14391.35s]  Black Sabbath had nothing to do with this. Spider-Man wrote and directed this song.
[14403.64s -> 14431.66s]  No, it was Morbius. I'm sorry. You're right. Watch that line. Don't go across it. I wish I
[14431.66s -> 14465.67s]  had more soap. An uncredited version of Black Sabbath. The mob rules appears in the soundtrack
[14465.67s -> 14486.28s]  during the boss battles against the supervillain. It was literally just ripped. That's so funny.
[14486.28s -> 14491.45s]  Back to our regularly scheduled water noises for a little bit. I'll put Plok on in a minute.
[14491.45s -> 14495.05s]  We've got to take a break from the, you know, that those sounds to these sounds.
[14495.61s -> 14512.50s]  I'll make a little rip bozo. What? Look at this place. I'm, I'm, I'm 55% of the way there.
[14512.50s -> 14528.97s]  I'm pretty much done. What's and I know there's still some, but this should blink eventually.
[14537.93s -> 14547.29s]  This streamer is like a goofy, that person left and then not coming back ever.
[14547.93s -> 14559.77s]  And I probably always remember that time when it was like, Hey, you should check out this guy,
[14559.77s -> 14566.39s]  Jerma. He's funny. I like him. And he's like, I'm yeah. I mean, I went to his stream and I'm not,
[14566.39s -> 14573.91s]  I'm not a fan. This guy's so crazy. He's like such a w wow. That was so weird. What he did.
[14575.03s -> 14600.18s]  He did like a goofy laugh to this guy. Did you hear this guy eats bugs? Jerma was funny today.
[14600.18s -> 14625.10s]  Sad. That's not fair. All right. Should I do the work order thing? No, I need a new line.
[14628.22s -> 14637.53s]  How is this only 57%? Here's the line right here. So from like here,
[14638.49s -> 14652.36s]  that's good. Um, yeah, whatever. That's fine. Let's get right in the middle here. There we go.
[14653.16s -> 14679.58s]  First pass. Why will we not play tally hall? What's tally hall tally hall? What, what is it?
[14681.10s -> 14691.48s]  Why people saying play tell? What's the, it's a band. Okay. It's a great band. It's just,
[14692.12s -> 14715.83s]  but why, why would I, it's just DMCA that they're good. They're good. But yeah,
[14716.79s -> 14725.08s]  I mean, I, I mean, I might put some DMCA shit up here, but I am playing a whole album on stream.
[14725.72s -> 14746.94s]  He isn't going to get me in trouble. All right. Let's clean this up a little bit more. Where's
[14746.94s -> 14763.90s]  the line? Right there. Right. What is this? Oh, I didn't even go up there. All right. So
[14764.54s -> 14770.81s]  I have a funny story about them. Think of water and soap. So my mother visited here at one time.
[14771.37s -> 14776.10s]  This is, I don't know, let's say it was, I don't remember exactly, but it was like last year at
[14776.10s -> 14786.30s]  some point. And my mother watches the channel sometimes. So she came over and she, you know,
[14786.30s -> 14791.42s]  was making references to the streams and Hey, yeah. So, you know, like look at me and stuff.
[14791.42s -> 14796.78s]  And I'm like, Oh my God, you watch, you actually watch the streams. So she started, she started to
[14796.78s -> 14804.55s]  like understand Twitch lingo and started to use it Andy. And the reason why I'm saying this is
[14804.55s -> 14814.18s]  because Holly was, was washing her hands, like very, very lightly, right? So she's washing her
[14814.18s -> 14826.12s]  hands. And my mother comes over to her and goes, Oh, wow. Soap Andy. Then she had never said
[14826.12s -> 14834.28s]  anything Andy before this. She called Holly soap Andy because Holly used like two pumps of soap.
[14844.12s -> 14862.22s]  And we just started cracking up. We were like, Holy shit. Oh no, we have converted her.
[14866.62s -> 14876.42s]  Soap Andy. It was like, honest to God, it was probably one of the cutest,
[14877.06s -> 14885.54s]  just most adorable things I've ever heard. It was just so funny. Like she had just learned the lingo.
[14885.54s -> 14889.94s]  She's like, I got it. I got an opportunity to use it. I saw two or three pumps of soap there.
[14891.40s -> 14916.14s]  Soap Andy. Has she been among us the whole time? I don't kind of. So sometimes I will stream
[14916.78s -> 14920.78s]  and my mother will make a reference to the stream that I did a day or two ago.
[14921.50s -> 14925.58s]  And I'm just sitting there going, there's no way she would know that unless she watched the whole
[14925.58s -> 14934.31s]  thing. But then other times, I think she just kind of pops in randomly. I think like once every like
[14934.31s -> 14940.04s]  few months, she will watch a stream, but I will have conversations and she will say,
[14940.92s -> 14944.97s]  you know, she'll say something like, there's no way you didn't watch a lot of the stream, right?
[14944.97s -> 14949.67s]  So for instance, like today, if my mother would have, would have get on the phone with me and be
[14949.67s -> 14954.15s]  like, oh yeah, so Jeremy, I found this new product. It's called the the water grenades.
[14954.15s -> 14986.12s]  I feel like you watched a lot of the stream today. Like you had to. For the love of God,
[14986.12s -> 14990.12s]  tell her to watch without chat. I don't think she even knows how to use chat.
[14993.99s -> 15044.06s]  She just like puts on the video player. There's still gunk on here. What? What did she think of
[15044.06s -> 15055.21s]  dollhouse? She liked it. If you don't understand the Twitch extension stuff, it's hard to follow
[15055.21s -> 15060.33s]  a lot of that sometimes. So but no, she she gets it. She understood. She knew what was going on.
[15061.05s -> 15100.98s]  Did you see you have whoopee with death? I assume I'm assuming. Yes, we don't talk about that
[15100.98s -> 15106.06s]  very often. And I'm realizing that my mother does watch stream sometimes. So she just heard
[15106.94s -> 15111.34s]  potentially a long conversation about me going to the doctor and eating bugs in a romantic
[15111.42s -> 15132.73s]  relationship with the guy. So she's a hate watcher. She just hates everything I'm doing.
[15138.44s -> 15147.00s]  That'd be so funny. Really, really bad stream today. Really not happy with what you were saying.
[15148.34s -> 15154.17s]  But that wasn't it wasn't funny. You know, I minus two the most I've ever minus two being your chat.
[15154.81s -> 15174.15s]  I didn't raise you like that. I raised you to be plus twos, Jeremy. Holly said she I missed the
[15174.15s -> 15213.14s]  romantic doctor bit. What is that? Babe, babe, delete the VOD. No, it's chat was acting crazy.
[15213.94s -> 15277.82s]  Like usual. She's being informed. She's laughing over here. Yeah, I okay. Yeah, I ate. I I chat said
[15277.82s -> 15286.10s]  I ate bugs with a guy. That's it. Yeah, I don't know why I'm like, oh, don't worry. No, no,
[15286.10s -> 15290.02s]  I literally ate bugs with the doctor. And that's it. That's it. That's literally it.
[15292.18s -> 15312.15s]  Somebody just wrote it was hot. Oh, please. Honey, honey, honey, honey, they fucked up. Okay.
[15312.87s -> 15338.42s]  Do you see you read that? Did you see that? This is unfair. You came up with the meat of the story.
[15338.42s -> 15344.58s]  She said, Why did the doctor have sexy biker shorts on? Hold on. Hold on a minute. Hold on
[15344.58s -> 15352.58s]  just a second. Never in that story. Never in that story. Did I say sexy biker shorts? Not one time.
[15353.14s -> 15359.16s]  I pull back the VOD. I want all of you to pull the VOD back. And not once did I say sexy biker
[15359.16s -> 15368.06s]  shorts. I did not say I said I said biker shorts. He was in biker shorts, not sexy biker shorts.
[15368.06s -> 15376.26s]  I want to know where that's from. Because it's not from me. It was verbatim.
[15377.22s -> 15435.11s]  All biker shorts are sexy. Okay. No, he was biking. She said, Okay, honey. Okay. See, there we go.
[15435.11s -> 15448.86s]  Honey, we're good. We're good. Stop saying sexy biker shorts. He said he was a 60 year old hot
[15448.86s -> 15466.22s]  biker guy. Skin is falling off my mouth. This is no this is not a sponsored stream anymore.
[15466.78s -> 15478.28s]  I genuinely think this is a fun game. This is not a sponsored segment anymore. The sponsor segment
[15478.28s -> 15487.48s]  is well done with that. This is just a very fun game, which Oh, man, I just wish I knew where I
[15487.48s -> 15492.98s]  could get it. Well, I can tell you. On the Xbox Game Pass store. You can get it. It's available
[15492.98s -> 15500.07s]  right now for Steam. It's on Steam right now. Just came into 1.0. Just came into 1.0 on Steam.
[15501.30s -> 15531.40s]  I forgot my line. Stop activating sleeper agents. It's got six co-op players. I feel like that's
[15531.40s -> 15569.37s]  gonna be insane. Why is everybody president sleeper? That's just your mom in chat. God damn.
[15569.37s -> 15580.47s]  That was a good one. That was seriously holy. Wow. That was a good one. But what a good callback.
[15580.47s -> 15610.20s]  That's a great callback. That was an absolute zinger. I can't believe I actually did the skate
[15610.28s -> 15668.17s]  park. That's shocking to me. Isn't it shocking to you? Got it. German sexy doctor sitting in a
[15668.17s -> 15712.15s]  skate park. E-A-T-I-N-G bugs. I found that one adequately humorous. Me too. Why did you read
[15712.15s -> 15719.54s]  that? Because it was funny. Are you questioning me reading messages in chat? I read a chat message
[15719.54s -> 15727.61s]  that said I said I was going to shove a baseball up my ass. There's no I'm you know, then that's
[15727.61s -> 15732.25s]  gonna get you banned, right? But I'm doesn't mean I'm not gonna read it and be shocked by it.
[15740.89s -> 15748.46s]  I keep that lives rent free in my head. You have no idea. You guys have no idea. I've said it
[15748.46s -> 15753.50s]  yesterday. It's rent free. Every day I think about somebody just typing out. Oh, no. Yeah,
[15753.50s -> 15756.62s]  dude. Let me help you out here. Are you really a new viewer? Yeah, let me help you. He's gonna
[15756.62s -> 15761.67s]  shove a whole baseball up his ass. That's the baseball stream. There's so much. There's so many
[15761.67s -> 15768.50s]  layers to why that's funny. So many. It's one of the funniest things I've ever heard probably in
[15768.50s -> 15776.66s]  chat because there's so much of the going on there. This is big stream event. I keep hyping it up,
[15776.66s -> 15781.30s]  man. Oh, the baseball stream, man. Be ready. It's gonna be me putting a baseball in my ass.
[15781.94s -> 15788.36s]  And I'm hyping it up for months and months and months and months in a like in a baseball field
[15793.27s -> 15799.67s]  or even not. Am I just here? That's what makes me laugh so much is I'm the baseball stream. Oh,
[15799.67s -> 15808.17s]  he's gonna play baseball. No, it's me in this chair putting a baseball in my ass. You understand
[15808.17s -> 15818.87s]  how much is going on here? And why? Why would I hype that up so much? Why would I ever? But just
[15818.87s -> 15825.24s]  so nonchalantly just replying to somebody with a very basic question. Dude, baseball stream.
[15825.24s -> 15833.51s]  I wonder what that is. A new viewer. Oh, replying to that person. Just as being a mother fucker.
[15834.39s -> 15844.38s]  Dude, he's gonna shove and it was it's not just baseball. It's whole baseball.
[15845.66s -> 15850.57s]  It's whole baseball. He's gonna shove a whole baseball up his ass.
[15852.89s -> 15869.40s]  It's like, God damn it. So much goes into that what I hear and see in my head. Hey, guys. Hey,
[15869.40s -> 15874.76s]  bro. Yeah, welcome to the baseball stream. It's time. Get hype. It's the baseball stream. I've
[15874.76s -> 15880.04s]  been talking about this for a long time. You know the stream where I shove a baseball up my ass.
[15880.04s -> 15892.20s]  It's like, what the fuck? Why would I get it? It's read free forever. I'll never get rid of it.
[15892.20s -> 15903.42s]  It's always going to be there because it's implied that I've been talking about it for months and
[15903.42s -> 15916.71s]  everyone's like super excited about that. This is so funny. It's so funny. Maybe. Whoa, cool.
[15918.42s -> 15924.87s]  Maybe I am a childish and immature moron, but I'm sorry that's funny.
[15926.39s -> 15953.32s]  That's very fucking funny. You know, and that person's banned from the channel, right?
[15955.00s -> 15958.52s]  Mods like please refresh my memory. That person has been permanently banned from this from

[16103.05s -> 16110.98s]  What do you mean? Why are you saying that? Because of the ball? The baseball? What is that?
[16115.58s -> 16124.79s]  Okay. Hey, by the way, I was a huge World of Warcraft fan, buddy. So let's relax for a sec.

[17583.45s -> 17596.82s]  I miss besides this wall right here this is the only wall right I think this is it and maybe the
[17596.82s -> 17649.14s]  tops well just hit me something just smashed into me threw me forward I didn't do anything
[17649.14s -> 17666.14s]  97 I'm gonna it's gonna be such a pain in the ass to find where this is you might enjoy death
[17666.14s -> 17673.19s]  stranding no I don't think so here's why so somebody said dude you like these kind of tasks
[17674.49s -> 17679.85s]  you're a big fan of just kind of like a menial task or whatever no see the issue is this game
[17679.85s -> 17688.92s]  I can kind of pick up and jump in for four or five hours or so um not a hundred hours right I mean
[17688.92s -> 17695.80s]  I can just play I can clean up the skate park I can be done I can do this in a couple hours but
[17695.80s -> 17707.96s]  when the whole game is a menial task and it's like a hundred hours long I'm not into it I would I
[17707.96s -> 17713.32s]  wouldn't be able to get through death stranding I know that it's a good game but I just um after
[17713.32s -> 17722.44s]  hour number 20 or 30 I'd be like I don't want to do this anymore I'd just be like that's a bad take
[17722.44s -> 17732.34s]  jackass I just said just wait why I just said the game is probably a great game but I might I just
[17732.34s -> 17736.42s]  I don't have attention span for stuff like that I don't have attention span for anything that's
[17736.42s -> 17742.86s]  over 50 plus hours for a game um and you probably say what about Elden Ring that's a once in a
[17742.86s -> 17750.38s]  lifetime video game there will never be another Elden Ring that is the Super Bowl of all video
[17750.38s -> 17757.80s]  games at this point like it's just come on it's once in a generation Sekiro didn't take me 100
