[1.78s -> 21.37s]  Alright, hello. Did we lose Ster? Ster's gone. He left. Oh no, he's not, he's here.
[21.37s -> 25.37s]  So for 12 months, way back when when you were allowed to do that as a channel.
[25.37s -> 26.57s]  Are you sticking around?
[27.75s -> 34.23s]  Yeah, I got guilted by my mom. My mom said don't stop playing video games right now.
[34.79s -> 39.11s]  Keep playing games. And now I have to keep playing games because my mom told me to.
[41.50s -> 45.42s]  You know what? It's such a... I feel like that could be true.
[45.98s -> 50.90s]  It is. It is 100% true. Okay.
[50.90s -> 56.58s]  My mom and my wife teamed up to guilt me into playing a game.
[56.58s -> 59.70s]  Because she's just like you, one of her favorite games is House Flipper.
[59.70s -> 64.74s]  She's put a ton of hours into it. She loves watching the Jerma House Flipper streams.
[65.54s -> 75.27s]  You ask her what her favorite stream or video is of her son, she'll say Jerma's House Flipper.
[75.27s -> 79.19s]  What, what incredible taste. I just have to say, seriously.
[79.19s -> 85.42s]  And then she says your welcome chat, but it's your, not apostrophe, you are.
[85.42s -> 86.14s]  She's just...
[86.14s -> 87.34s]  What about you are?
[87.34s -> 89.58s]  All right. How do we, how do we play this game?
[90.70s -> 92.06s]  Are we loading it up right now?
[92.06s -> 94.17s]  We're going to open it.
[94.17s -> 95.29s]  You guys don't even know.
[95.29s -> 96.89s]  Hope it's not loud. Hope it's not loud. Hope it's not loud.
[97.61s -> 99.21s]  Prepare for loud game. Hold on.
[99.93s -> 107.93s]  Oh, I'm going to mute just in case.
[108.65s -> 115.74s]  It might be loud. Star's going to be getting, Star's getting grumpy.
[116.70s -> 123.48s]  What's your favorite food?
[123.48s -> 124.36s]  Now, like at this point.
[125.30s -> 147.38s]  Yeah. Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on. Um, what is it? Is this a, is this like a joke?
[149.53s -> 154.25s]  No, no, no. Like the, okay, the opening page.
[154.25s -> 155.29s]  I don't even want to show this.
[159.54s -> 161.38s]  No, it's like a person's phone number.
[167.64s -> 169.24s]  Thank you for playing our early access.
[169.24s -> 173.64s]  By the way, if you want to like call this person, that's like the CEO of the, wow.
[175.86s -> 178.90s]  I don't, I, I, this might be fake. Is this part of the game?
[183.11s -> 184.63s]  No, no. Fuck that.
[184.63s -> 188.34s]  All right. No. All right. I would still, how do we play together?
[191.03s -> 200.65s]  Start game. Hold on. Progress report a bug. Remove is split input.
[200.65s -> 201.85s]  All right. I'm going to go start game.
[204.94s -> 207.50s]  How do we play this together? Anybody? Do we have any idea?
[208.30s -> 215.67s]  Well, hold on. I think you have to do the tutorial.
[221.26s -> 228.63s]  You'll be all right. You're going to be fine.
[230.33s -> 231.45s]  See, we've, do you believe that?
[232.25s -> 238.12s]  Well, then that contradicts what you just said.
[239.56s -> 247.19s]  Okay. So I don't know if it's like, no, dude, I'm serious.
[247.51s -> 253.00s]  At talks, it shows like a guy's phone number.
[253.00s -> 258.52s]  Oh man, guys. Hold on. You guys have been muted this whole time.
[258.52s -> 260.68s]  I'm so sorry. He's all right.
[261.56s -> 262.84s]  That's okay. I wasn't even talking.
[264.71s -> 266.31s]  I muted you for most of that time.
[266.31s -> 270.39s]  Okay. Fuck. I was muted the whole time. God damn it.
[270.39s -> 273.75s]  Okay. I'm going to call this guy and I'm going to do that.
[276.18s -> 278.34s]  Hey, do we have to play the tutorial first?
[279.38s -> 280.26s]  Yes. Just do it.
[282.07s -> 283.19s]  No, I'm going to ask him.
[284.15s -> 285.67s]  Oh my fucking God.
[288.36s -> 291.24s]  I'm just going to play the game and we'll, we'll kill them in a minute.
[291.24s -> 293.24s]  To craft new track pieces, you need wood and iron.
[294.04s -> 296.84s]  Grab region is plus 49.
[296.84s -> 297.64s]  Stop, stop it.
[299.24s -> 302.28s]  Dude, anyone who wants this can just buy the game.
[303.40s -> 311.80s]  Oh, it's Germany.
[312.68s -> 317.26s]  All right. You have to chop down wood.
[319.42s -> 321.26s]  What time is it in Germany? It's late.
[322.22s -> 325.62s]  I think we'd, yeah, we're doing the tutorial.
[329.29s -> 330.65s]  It's too late. I'm not calling them.
[331.61s -> 334.10s]  It's going to go to his answering.
[334.10s -> 335.54s]  Yeah. It's probably like five 30 there.
[335.54s -> 336.26s]  He's probably asleep.
[336.26s -> 339.70s]  No, it's 2 a.m. They're saying, I mean, I'll tell you, you gotta,
[339.70s -> 346.82s]  you gotta have some like iron, iron body to put your personal telephone
[346.82s -> 349.06s]  number at the splash screen of your video game.
[349.94s -> 354.12s]  It probably goes to like a Hulk Hogan fake answering machine.
[354.12s -> 355.00s]  It probably does.
[359.29s -> 360.89s]  Okay. So what am I doing?
[360.89s -> 362.09s]  What do I do? Start game?
[362.81s -> 365.53s]  But how do we play? I gotta call this guy.
[365.53s -> 366.49s]  Just do the tutorial.
[367.45s -> 368.81s]  Is that when you click start game?
[369.37s -> 370.25s]  Yeah, just yes.
[370.25s -> 373.05s]  Yes. All right. So you put both.
[384.87s -> 386.87s]  Holy shit. This is going to be insanely difficult.
[387.75s -> 388.55s]  Is it?
[388.55s -> 389.11s]  I think so.
[391.05s -> 392.25s]  Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[392.89s -> 394.54s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[394.54s -> 397.02s]  This is on Twitch yet.
[397.82s -> 399.10s]  What's it called? Unrailed.
[399.82s -> 402.71s]  Unrailed. Okay.
[402.71s -> 404.31s]  It is. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[405.27s -> 407.75s]  What are we holding up for?
[408.39s -> 410.10s]  Can you do me a favor?
[411.27s -> 411.75s]  Yeah. What is it?
[411.75s -> 412.87s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[413.59s -> 421.13s]  I don't know how to bring that screen back up again.
[421.93s -> 423.61s]  It doesn't do it if you reopen the game.
[423.61s -> 426.17s]  All right. I'm going to be I want to be the first one to finish the tutorial
[426.17s -> 427.61s]  so I can see how smart I am.
[427.61s -> 428.25s]  I don't think he is.
[429.98s -> 431.34s]  His phone number lost to me.
[432.70s -> 436.01s]  It really doesn't show it again if you don't.
[436.73s -> 438.49s]  That's like I don't know how to bring it back up.
[439.45s -> 441.24s]  Oh, I got it.
[443.59s -> 446.55s]  The train overheats over time and will start to burn.
[446.55s -> 448.71s]  Build a bridge to the bucket and fill it with the river.
[455.26s -> 455.90s]  Nobody tell him.
[456.54s -> 458.06s]  How the hell are we going to do this together?
[460.30s -> 462.38s]  We've got like sleepy star on the call.
[462.38s -> 463.66s]  You think he's going to want to do this?
[464.30s -> 465.98s]  How do I do a plus on the phone?
[468.65s -> 470.65s]  It says zero is a plus.
[470.65s -> 471.45s]  Done it.
[471.45s -> 472.97s]  Tutorial done. I win.
[474.17s -> 474.57s]  Well, I didn't know.
[474.57s -> 476.09s]  I'm the smartest gamer.
[476.09s -> 478.01s]  I didn't even know it was a competition until you said it.
[478.01s -> 479.05s]  You could have been speed running it.
[480.25s -> 491.40s]  Okay. There we go.
[491.40s -> 492.76s]  Online game.
[492.76s -> 493.26s]  Yeah.
[493.96s -> 495.46s]  All right. Do we know how this...
[495.46s -> 497.06s]  Is this just through Steam or what?
[498.26s -> 499.30s]  That is a good question.
[501.24s -> 502.76s]  Create private lobby.
[503.72s -> 504.76s]  Might want to hide your...
[507.00s -> 508.04s]  What the hell are you doing?
[510.36s -> 510.86s]  Fucked up.
[512.04s -> 514.25s]  Are you trying to call this person?
[514.25s -> 515.61s]  That's the way he wrote it.
[515.61s -> 517.53s]  But then it says that's not how you do it.
[518.49s -> 521.77s]  You can't call from the United States.
[522.49s -> 522.89s]  You can.
[522.89s -> 523.37s]  Two tur...
[523.37s -> 523.93s]  No, you can't.
[524.49s -> 525.05s]  You can just sit...
[525.05s -> 526.65s]  Best case scenario.
[526.65s -> 527.69s]  Best case scenario.
[527.69s -> 528.33s]  He answers.
[528.33s -> 529.45s]  He goes, hi, how are you?
[529.45s -> 532.09s]  And you go, hi, I'm streaming your game right now.
[532.09s -> 532.89s]  He tunes in.
[532.89s -> 535.69s]  Then you insult him and like say his game sucks.
[536.33s -> 539.13s]  And you personally call him to like make fun of him.
[539.13s -> 542.65s]  You have to do like star something something.
[542.65s -> 543.69s]  You can't just call the number.
[543.69s -> 544.17s]  No, no, no.
[544.17s -> 546.41s]  See, because it's plus 49 for Germany.
[546.97s -> 548.49s]  And then it has parentheses zero.
[548.49s -> 549.53s]  You gotta do something before that.
[549.53s -> 551.77s]  What it just said is not to do the parentheses zero.
[551.77s -> 553.21s]  But that's the way he wrote it.
[554.81s -> 558.20s]  Plus that call is going to cost you like $60 a minute.
[563.29s -> 563.77s]  Guys, I'm...
[563.77s -> 564.33s]  I can't.
[564.33s -> 566.09s]  I'm making Jerma very uncomfortable.
[566.89s -> 573.54s]  Like I just wanted to have a conversation about his game with other people.
[574.26s -> 576.38s]  And Jerma said, you know what?
[576.38s -> 576.86s]  I have...
[576.86s -> 578.06s]  I have a session.
[578.06s -> 579.10s]  Are you done with the tutorial?
[580.60s -> 581.00s]  I see.
[581.00s -> 583.80s]  And it's people like you is why we're never going to find Hillary's emails.
[584.68s -> 586.95s]  What do I do in this tutorial?
[586.95s -> 588.39s]  Well, I could try moving your character.
[588.39s -> 590.31s]  Oh, you motherfucker.
[591.03s -> 592.79s]  I was calling him.
[592.79s -> 593.35s]  I was busy.
[593.35s -> 598.47s]  You were trying to call a person that you don't know's random telephone number
[598.47s -> 599.99s]  for a laugh out loud.
[599.99s -> 601.51s]  Fucking look what I'm doing on the stream.
[601.51s -> 602.87s]  I'm going to call this guy.
[602.87s -> 604.79s]  And even moved your character on the screen.
[605.91s -> 607.05s]  I didn't even...
[607.05s -> 608.01s]  I just got in the game.
[608.73s -> 609.53s]  Oh, my God.
[609.53s -> 609.77s]  All right.
[609.77s -> 610.81s]  What are the buttons?
[610.81s -> 612.01s]  How do I join you?
[612.01s -> 613.37s]  You have to give me your session ID.
[613.37s -> 614.65s]  I have a session ID.
[615.53s -> 616.65s]  I have a session ID.
[616.65s -> 617.69s]  I'm about to give it to you.
[617.69s -> 618.89s]  I'm going to put it into the chat.
[620.25s -> 624.49s]  Star, don't leak this.
[630.47s -> 631.51s]  That's the session ID.
[633.38s -> 635.46s]  He wants people to call him, though.
[635.46s -> 636.18s]  It's different.
[639.48s -> 642.28s]  Yeah, if there's like a bug or something, you're just going to...
[642.28s -> 643.24s]  What's the purpose of your call?
[645.19s -> 648.47s]  I was going to ask if we had to do the tutorial before we play together.
[648.47s -> 650.15s]  You're our speakerphone on my stream.
[652.62s -> 652.94s]  Okay.
[653.98s -> 654.54s]  What do you want?
[657.42s -> 657.98s]  Just hang up.
[658.70s -> 661.90s]  Do you honestly think that's the worst call he would have ever done?
[661.90s -> 662.14s]  No.
[662.78s -> 663.66s]  Excuse me, sir.
[663.66s -> 665.74s]  I'm showing interest in your indie game.
[665.74s -> 668.38s]  I know you worked really hard on it, but I'd rather not talk to you
[668.38s -> 669.74s]  and not share it with anyone.
[669.74s -> 670.06s]  Fine.
[671.10s -> 673.86s]  Tal, do you have 466 ping right now?
[677.03s -> 677.27s]  Why?
[679.27s -> 682.12s]  Grab some wood.
[682.12s -> 683.00s]  Jerma, where's the wood?
[683.00s -> 683.48s]  Why is this ping so high?
[685.29s -> 685.85s]  The wood...
[685.85s -> 686.89s]  If you chalk down...
[686.89s -> 689.93s]  Have you ever played a video game that's come out in the last 10 years?
[689.93s -> 691.53s]  You have to get wood from the tree.
[692.49s -> 696.10s]  Is there action we're not seeing?
[696.10s -> 696.66s]  Yeah, there is.
[696.66s -> 699.86s]  But the session ID is on the screen, so I can't show it.
[700.42s -> 701.54s]  I don't know how to do this.
[709.93s -> 711.13s]  How do you make the rail?
[711.93s -> 716.39s]  Oh, wait.
[716.39s -> 717.99s]  Did the Talix show the session ID?
[719.74s -> 721.66s]  What did that tutorial message just say?
[722.62s -> 724.28s]  I'm out.
[725.61s -> 726.49s]  I almost got it.
[727.13s -> 728.60s]  I left the call.
[729.24s -> 729.72s]  Not the call.
[729.72s -> 730.44s]  I left the lobby.
[732.28s -> 734.68s]  Okay, Star, you have to host this lobby because we're on like...
[735.24s -> 736.20s]  You have to host this.
[736.84s -> 738.20s]  My train's on fire.
[738.20s -> 740.04s]  Yes, go get the bucket.
[740.04s -> 743.16s]  Stand next to the water and let it fill and then walk over to the left and pour it.
[744.20s -> 747.14s]  Oh, okay.
[749.06s -> 752.26s]  Remember when you wanted me to play and my mom wanted me to play?
[752.26s -> 753.22s]  Changing diapers here.
[754.97s -> 755.77s]  Isn't that weird?
[760.54s -> 762.54s]  Oops, was I muted?
[762.54s -> 763.58s]  Oh, I was.
[763.58s -> 764.94s]  You leaked us.
[764.94s -> 768.30s]  I know, but it doesn't matter because he's not even done with the tutorial anyway.
[768.54s -> 772.86s]  Make sure you put your region to US West, by the way.
[773.74s -> 774.46s]  I have to do that?
[775.50s -> 785.29s]  Yeah, go to online and then go to region US West and select it.
[788.34s -> 789.62s]  What if I did Korea?
[790.74s -> 795.14s]  Then it would be very bad because you would be relaying through entire continents.
[795.14s -> 796.58s]  Okay, how do I join you?
[796.58s -> 797.78s]  Or do I need to call the guy?
[797.86s -> 802.66s]  You're going to hit a BRB screen or black out your screen.
[802.66s -> 804.26s]  You're going to go to create private lobby.
[806.22s -> 806.54s]  Okay.
[806.54s -> 809.10s]  There's going to be a seed in the top left.
[809.10s -> 810.94s]  Don't tell anybody else that seed.
[810.94s -> 812.06s]  That's just for me to tell us.
[812.86s -> 815.10s]  Wouldn't it be cool if like a hundred people joined though?
[816.46s -> 818.22s]  This game can only have like five...
[818.22s -> 819.74s]  I think there's only four people.
[824.09s -> 826.01s]  All right, and then you're going to just type into the chat.
[826.81s -> 829.05s]  Make sure you're US West in your region.
[829.05s -> 832.25s]  And you're going to type into the discord chat with the three of us in here.
[832.25s -> 835.21s]  And that five digit seed session ID.
[836.33s -> 836.89s]  Hold on.
[836.89s -> 838.09s]  My game like froze.
[839.13s -> 842.71s]  What the fuck is happening?
[842.71s -> 843.11s]  Are you...
[843.11s -> 846.55s]  Did you click on session ID and it's got a little cursor and you have to press escape?
[848.38s -> 849.50s]  I'm focusing.
[855.91s -> 856.31s]  Okay.
[856.31s -> 857.11s]  And now I...
[857.11s -> 859.43s]  Do I start the game or do I give this to you first?
[859.43s -> 859.99s]  Just wait to...
[859.99s -> 860.95s]  Don't hit start yet.
[860.95s -> 861.43s]  Just give...
[862.47s -> 864.39s]  It is definitely not poo poo.
[864.39s -> 865.27s]  It's definitely not...
[865.27s -> 865.83s]  That's not the password.
[865.83s -> 866.87s]  That is what it is.
[866.87s -> 868.55s]  Because I know it's not special.
[868.55s -> 868.95s]  It is.
[870.31s -> 880.68s]  Hang on.
[880.68s -> 881.32s]  Are we sure?
[881.96s -> 882.60s]  I don't know.
[883.56s -> 884.60s]  I don't know if that's real.
[884.60s -> 888.04s]  I actually had to look on Steam to check to see if he even installed the game.
[888.04s -> 889.64s]  I wondered if this was just a bruise.
[890.68s -> 894.81s]  But yeah, he is in fact in the game on Steam.
[894.81s -> 896.57s]  He's in his poo poo lobby.
[896.57s -> 897.21s]  Okay.
[897.21s -> 897.61s]  Let's go.
[898.97s -> 899.53s]  Yeah, we have to...
[899.53s -> 900.41s]  Is that how that works?
[901.13s -> 902.33s]  I'm going to join your lobby.
[903.13s -> 903.61s]  Session ID.
[903.61s -> 903.85s]  Oh, wait.
[903.85s -> 905.61s]  No, you want session ID?
[905.61s -> 905.93s]  Yes.
[909.62s -> 911.38s]  You just made a custom seed.
[911.38s -> 912.34s]  Okay, cool.
[912.34s -> 914.42s]  I thought I was...
[914.42s -> 916.26s]  No, make sure you're not showing this to anybody.
[917.06s -> 917.70s]  I'm not.
[917.70s -> 918.26s]  I'm not.
[918.26s -> 918.98s]  Why would I do that?
[920.18s -> 921.82s]  Okay.
[923.26s -> 924.70s]  I can't get off of the typing.
[926.33s -> 926.57s]  Okay.
[926.57s -> 927.37s]  There we go.
[927.37s -> 928.17s]  Now don't...
[928.97s -> 929.53s]  Game mode.
[930.17s -> 930.73s]  Difficulty.
[933.26s -> 934.22s]  Enable checkpoints.
[934.22s -> 935.58s]  Who would leak such a thing?
[936.46s -> 938.14s]  Do not allow random players to join.
[938.86s -> 939.34s]  Are we good?
[939.90s -> 940.30s]  Difficulty?
[940.30s -> 941.26s]  Don't put it on medium.
[941.26s -> 942.06s]  Don't put it on hard.
[942.06s -> 942.94s]  There's no way we're going to do that.
[943.82s -> 944.86s]  We're idiots.
[944.86s -> 946.38s]  And game mode endless.
[946.38s -> 948.46s]  Why would we not do game mode like normal?
[951.00s -> 952.52s]  Well, isn't endless the normal?
[952.52s -> 953.40s]  I guess it is normal.
[953.40s -> 953.72s]  All right.
[955.13s -> 958.33s]  Endless is like see how far you can get before you crash.
[958.33s -> 958.81s]  All right.
[958.81s -> 959.29s]  You ready?
[959.93s -> 960.33s]  Let's go.
[960.89s -> 961.93s]  With checkpoints enabled,
[961.93s -> 965.37s]  you can restart at the first station in each biome after you crash.
[965.37s -> 965.61s]  All right.
[965.61s -> 966.97s]  Are we ready to start streaming this game?
[966.97s -> 968.65s]  Do not show up on the leaderboard.
[968.65s -> 969.13s]  Hurry up.
[969.13s -> 969.77s]  I showed it.
[969.77s -> 971.37s]  So everyone come stand up here.
[971.37s -> 972.33s]  You have to all stand here.
[972.33s -> 973.37s]  I think I showed it.
[974.01s -> 975.13s]  I definitely showed it.
[975.77s -> 976.41s]  You showed it.
[976.41s -> 977.21s]  Let's go.
[977.21s -> 978.01s]  It was an accident.
[978.01s -> 980.01s]  I thought we were starting.
[980.01s -> 981.13s]  He showed it.
[981.77s -> 982.01s]  Okay.
[983.05s -> 983.29s]  Okay.
[983.29s -> 985.37s]  If you guys actually have this game, call that number.
[985.37s -> 986.09s]  Tell me what happened.
[986.65s -> 986.97s]  Okay.
[986.97s -> 987.37s]  Let's go.
[987.37s -> 989.05s]  We got to kill the creepers.
[990.17s -> 990.89s]  The Enderman.
[990.89s -> 995.13s]  We got to build a train track and we got to dig a path for it straight ahead.
[995.13s -> 996.81s]  So go directly in front.
[996.81s -> 998.41s]  The train is already moving.
[998.41s -> 999.21s]  Yeah, it's moving.
[999.85s -> 1000.01s]  All right.
[1000.01s -> 1001.21s]  We're making train tracks.
[1001.21s -> 1001.37s]  Yeah.
[1001.37s -> 1002.09s]  This is endless.
[1007.56s -> 1008.52s]  This is stressful.
[1009.16s -> 1009.40s]  All right.
[1009.40s -> 1010.52s]  So we ain't seen nothing yet.
[1011.64s -> 1014.14s]  What is this bucket?
[1014.14s -> 1014.78s]  What's the bucket?
[1016.06s -> 1018.52s]  You did the tutorial.
[1018.52s -> 1019.00s]  No, I know.
[1019.00s -> 1020.12s]  But what's the water?
[1020.12s -> 1021.24s]  Water, water, water, water, water, water.
[1022.04s -> 1026.17s]  I got to make another mine.
[1026.73s -> 1027.45s]  We need track.
[1028.41s -> 1029.45s]  We need wood.
[1029.45s -> 1030.49s]  But there's no footies.
[1030.49s -> 1030.97s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1030.97s -> 1031.45s]  I got to go up.
[1032.57s -> 1033.90s]  You got to dig up.
[1033.90s -> 1034.54s]  Who is this person?
[1034.54s -> 1035.66s]  The person is hitting me.
[1035.66s -> 1036.14s]  We're dead.
[1036.70s -> 1037.26s]  We're dead.
[1038.54s -> 1038.70s]  All right.
[1038.70s -> 1039.02s]  Get out.
[1039.02s -> 1039.50s]  Get out.
[1039.90s -> 1043.18s]  Where is it?
[1045.45s -> 1046.17s]  I can't move.
[1046.73s -> 1047.85s]  You have somebody to break me out.
[1048.81s -> 1051.48s]  We got trees.
[1052.95s -> 1055.19s]  We need that pickaxe so we can actually...
[1055.19s -> 1056.15s]  You guys can't get over here.
[1056.15s -> 1056.63s]  Oh my God.
[1056.63s -> 1057.51s]  You just made a turn.
[1057.51s -> 1058.31s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1061.94s -> 1062.18s]  Okay.
[1071.58s -> 1072.30s]  How do we get water?
[1072.30s -> 1074.30s]  Water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water.
[1074.30s -> 1078.07s]  We got to get a crossing.
[1078.07s -> 1080.62s]  We're killing the creepers.
[1080.62s -> 1090.66s]  Where's the pickaxe?
[1091.94s -> 1092.42s]  I got it.
[1093.69s -> 1094.09s]  What?
[1094.09s -> 1095.05s]  Put wood in the thing.
[1095.05s -> 1095.77s]  What?
[1095.77s -> 1097.29s]  Put wood in it.
[1097.29s -> 1098.57s]  There's no wood.
[1098.57s -> 1099.53s]  I'm chopping the trees.
[1099.53s -> 1100.17s]  Come get the wood.
[1102.92s -> 1103.16s]  All right.
[1103.16s -> 1106.06s]  I need one piece of wood to build a bridge.
[1107.02s -> 1110.86s]  Not a space.
[1110.86s -> 1111.58s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1113.90s -> 1114.54s]  What is that?
[1115.82s -> 1117.34s]  Why is this a mini?
[1117.34s -> 1117.82s]  How do I...
[1117.82s -> 1118.38s]  No, this way.
[1118.38s -> 1118.78s]  Right here.
[1120.78s -> 1122.06s]  This is just grass.
[1122.06s -> 1122.46s]  Okay.
[1122.46s -> 1123.42s]  So we can go over that.
[1124.54s -> 1125.94s]  Should we go right?
[1126.58s -> 1127.38s]  No, go straight.
[1127.38s -> 1128.34s]  I cleared a path already.
[1128.34s -> 1129.30s]  It goes all the way up to here.
[1129.30s -> 1130.90s]  Oh, okay.
[1131.54s -> 1132.10s]  Where's the axe?
[1132.90s -> 1133.38s]  I got it.
[1137.32s -> 1138.28s]  We need more wood.
[1138.28s -> 1139.24s]  All right, wood behind me.
[1139.24s -> 1140.36s]  Fire, fire.
[1140.36s -> 1141.40s]  It's about to die.
[1141.40s -> 1141.96s]  It's over.
[1141.96s -> 1145.16s]  It's going to crash, it's going to crash, it's going to crash, crash, crash, crash, crash.
[1146.52s -> 1150.28s]  Just get the tracks.
[1151.32s -> 1151.56s]  Uh-oh.
[1151.56s -> 1152.04s]  I fucked.
[1154.60s -> 1155.24s]  We can turn it.
[1155.24s -> 1155.64s]  We can turn it.
[1155.64s -> 1157.00s]  No, you can't turn it.
[1157.00s -> 1158.68s]  What do you mean you can turn it?
[1158.68s -> 1160.28s]  Is this snake advanced?
[1161.88s -> 1162.76s]  Where's the axe?
[1162.76s -> 1163.40s]  Oh, my God.
[1163.40s -> 1164.04s]  All right, turn it again.
[1165.24s -> 1165.64s]  Hang on.
[1166.20s -> 1168.92s]  Time, time.
[1169.48s -> 1170.82s]  We need more wood.
[1171.70s -> 1173.30s]  I'm chopping it down right now.
[1174.42s -> 1179.13s]  I've got a ton of wood up here.
[1184.12s -> 1184.76s]  So you got...
[1186.52s -> 1187.32s]  Oh, my God.
[1188.79s -> 1190.55s]  I'm going to chop down every tree over here.
[1192.28s -> 1193.96s]  Too many cooks in the kitchen.
[1195.48s -> 1196.92s]  We're just going to go on a straight line.
[1196.92s -> 1198.20s]  Yeah, but we need wood and shit.
[1198.20s -> 1199.64s]  I'm just going to be the wood guy.
[1199.64s -> 1202.68s]  But you just chop a straight path all the way through and we'll be fine.
[1202.68s -> 1203.24s]  But wood.
[1210.87s -> 1211.59s]  Where's the bucket?
[1213.16s -> 1214.12s]  I'm already splashing.
[1214.92s -> 1215.40s]  Okay.
[1215.40s -> 1216.12s]  How are we doing?
[1216.12s -> 1216.68s]  Good.
[1216.68s -> 1216.92s]  Right.
[1216.92s -> 1218.68s]  We need just regular old track.
[1220.79s -> 1221.51s]  Tons of stone.
[1226.44s -> 1226.68s]  All right.
[1226.68s -> 1227.32s]  That was almost...
[1228.28s -> 1229.08s]  What can I chop?
[1230.44s -> 1230.76s]  Over here.
[1230.76s -> 1231.24s]  It's the right...
[1231.80s -> 1234.50s]  I'm going to throw up.
[1235.30s -> 1238.87s]  Things have kind of calmed down a little.
[1238.87s -> 1239.51s]  Yeah, that was good.
[1239.51s -> 1241.27s]  That was a little panicky for a minute, but it's all right.
[1243.27s -> 1253.53s]  All right.
[1253.53s -> 1254.89s]  We got tons of resources.
[1255.61s -> 1257.05s]  We have a lot of resources.
[1257.05s -> 1258.73s]  Build resources.
[1258.73s -> 1259.93s]  Remember back in the day.
[1260.49s -> 1260.73s]  Yeah.
[1262.07s -> 1262.31s]  Good.
[1266.15s -> 1267.11s]  Is your track ready?
[1267.99s -> 1268.95s]  Oh, my God.
[1269.75s -> 1270.87s]  You see, it's hard to place.
[1272.07s -> 1273.67s]  Actually, that's not a bad idea.
[1274.23s -> 1275.75s]  It'll take a long time to get over here.
[1278.02s -> 1278.26s]  All right.
[1278.26s -> 1279.46s]  I'm going to chop down some...
[1280.42s -> 1281.99s]  I'm going to get some more stone.
[1283.02s -> 1284.54s]  I think we're going to go straight down this way.
[1285.26s -> 1289.26s]  Why not go...
[1289.26s -> 1290.54s]  You got to go to the station.
[1290.54s -> 1291.18s]  That's what I'm doing.
[1292.30s -> 1292.54s]  Oh.
[1293.18s -> 1296.28s]  Well, why not go through the trees and then we get a bunch of wood?
[1297.24s -> 1298.92s]  Look at all the wood that's already around all over the place.
[1298.92s -> 1299.96s]  We got a fire.
[1299.96s -> 1301.16s]  There's tons of wood.
[1301.16s -> 1302.44s]  How about we speed this thing up?
[1303.08s -> 1304.52s]  It probably will when you hit the checkpoint.
[1305.56s -> 1305.72s]  All right.
[1305.72s -> 1309.11s]  We got plenty of resources.
[1309.11s -> 1309.83s]  Where's the axe?
[1309.83s -> 1311.35s]  I'm going to use it.
[1311.35s -> 1311.75s]  Good.
[1311.75s -> 1312.15s]  Very good.
[1312.87s -> 1320.12s]  Pass game.
[1321.40s -> 1324.31s]  Turn your volume down.
[1324.31s -> 1324.63s]  All right.
[1324.63s -> 1324.79s]  Quick.
[1324.79s -> 1326.15s]  You got to get in front of it.
[1326.15s -> 1326.63s]  What do I do?
[1327.35s -> 1327.59s]  All right.
[1327.59s -> 1328.07s]  You're good.
[1328.87s -> 1331.27s]  Just it's about to go on the...
[1333.11s -> 1333.35s]  On the...
[1334.07s -> 1334.63s]  Straight away.
[1336.71s -> 1338.39s]  Yeah, we can build bridges, dude.
[1339.19s -> 1340.15s]  We need more stone.
[1340.15s -> 1340.95s]  We need stone.
[1340.95s -> 1341.35s]  Stone.
[1342.71s -> 1344.38s]  Water, wood, no stone.
[1345.34s -> 1346.38s]  There's stone on the ground here.
[1347.51s -> 1348.71s]  Fucking crybaby.
[1348.71s -> 1349.27s]  It's raining.
[1350.15s -> 1356.34s]  Let me introduce you to who is what character.
[1357.06s -> 1358.18s]  I'm Penguin.
[1358.18s -> 1358.58s]  I'm...
[1359.38s -> 1359.86s]  Cowboy.
[1360.58s -> 1360.90s]  You're Indiana Jones.
[1360.90s -> 1362.66s]  Snowman.
[1362.66s -> 1363.78s]  At the top right of...
[1363.78s -> 1364.82s]  I don't know what I am.
[1364.82s -> 1365.38s]  Stone?
[1365.38s -> 1365.86s]  Who are you?
[1365.86s -> 1366.58s]  Stone man?
[1367.14s -> 1367.86s]  Skull man?
[1367.86s -> 1368.74s]  I think I'm like a man.
[1368.74s -> 1370.74s]  Skull skeleton in a suit or something?
[1371.94s -> 1373.43s]  I just call me Sans.
[1374.71s -> 1375.51s]  Remember that game?
[1376.47s -> 1377.62s]  I played that game.
[1378.18s -> 1379.30s]  I did not.
[1379.30s -> 1379.86s]  I did not.
[1380.74s -> 1381.14s]  I wonder if I...
[1381.14s -> 1382.18s]  Can I pause it and...
[1382.18s -> 1383.46s]  What if I show the session ID?
[1385.94s -> 1386.82s]  Uh-oh, it's nighttime.
[1394.92s -> 1395.40s]  Dude, what?
[1396.36s -> 1396.92s]  Dude, what?
[1397.72s -> 1398.92s]  Well, there's tons of it down here.
[1398.92s -> 1399.40s]  It's going, it's going.
[1400.60s -> 1408.87s]  I need some stone, though.
[1409.43s -> 1409.91s]  I'm on it.
[1414.23s -> 1414.79s]  Sorry.
[1415.99s -> 1416.71s]  It's too dark.
[1416.71s -> 1417.99s]  I can't see anything.
[1417.99s -> 1419.11s]  I'm honestly scared.
[1422.79s -> 1423.83s]  Wait, how did I ruin it?
[1423.83s -> 1424.63s]  What?
[1424.63s -> 1425.59s]  We're gonna need that bucket.
[1427.51s -> 1429.03s]  Yeah, we'll get it, Will.
[1429.03s -> 1430.23s]  This is a tight fit.
[1430.63s -> 1437.88s]  All right, this is just the first station.
[1438.92s -> 1440.12s]  That means we beat level one.
[1440.12s -> 1440.68s]  Got it.
[1440.68s -> 1441.32s]  Oh, no.
[1441.32s -> 1441.88s]  Oh, no.
[1441.88s -> 1442.52s]  Why's it going so fast?
[1442.52s -> 1443.32s]  What's fucking happening?
[1443.32s -> 1444.84s]  Because they've got to run to the station.
[1444.84s -> 1445.34s]  Oh.
[1446.52s -> 1447.32s]  We're gonna get money.
[1448.84s -> 1451.00s]  You can spin your bolts for wagon upgrades.
[1451.00s -> 1451.96s]  Oh, what?
[1453.00s -> 1453.56s]  New wagons?
[1453.56s -> 1456.06s]  So we get two bolts.
[1456.06s -> 1457.02s]  What do they do?
[1457.02s -> 1458.78s]  New engines and you unlock.
[1458.78s -> 1459.98s]  Crafting speed.
[1459.98s -> 1461.18s]  So it makes track fast.
[1462.46s -> 1462.62s]  More...
[1462.62s -> 1464.66s]  Is this a water tank?
[1465.70s -> 1466.66s]  Or more...
[1467.96s -> 1471.96s]  Or more supplies can go in there to be crafted.
[1472.92s -> 1476.52s]  I think it's gonna be difficult to deal with the speed.
[1476.52s -> 1480.04s]  We need more, like, stacks in the storage thing.
[1480.84s -> 1481.48s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1481.48s -> 1482.44s]  Let's do that.
[1482.44s -> 1484.28s]  But then we got new wagon.
[1484.28s -> 1485.48s]  Lights up in the dark.
[1486.44s -> 1487.56s]  What's this one?
[1488.66s -> 1490.10s]  Crafting speed of 60%.
[1490.98s -> 1493.22s]  Converts wood to iron or iron to wood.
[1495.06s -> 1496.82s]  Steam engine for the Wild West.
[1496.82s -> 1497.30s]  How do we go fast?
[1497.30s -> 1498.02s]  Where's our money?
[1498.98s -> 1501.62s]  Is it one more bolt?
[1501.62s -> 1502.66s]  Yeah, we only have one bolt.
[1504.58s -> 1506.18s]  Let's get capacity on this thing.
[1509.94s -> 1510.66s]  Yeah, that's good.
[1510.66s -> 1511.86s]  We're good, we're good, we're good.
[1511.86s -> 1514.74s]  That's 60% faster and extra stacks.
[1514.74s -> 1515.78s]  Exit stand here.
[1517.96s -> 1519.24s]  Which one of these is correct?
[1519.24s -> 1521.16s]  I think exit stand here.
[1521.16s -> 1522.60s]  Exit stand here, dude.
[1526.82s -> 1528.74s]  All right, Chad's mad that we didn't get a ghost.
[1529.62s -> 1531.77s]  I don't know what it meant.
[1533.51s -> 1536.87s]  All right, we don't have time to sit around and dilly dally.
[1538.31s -> 1541.05s]  We surely do not.
[1541.05s -> 1542.41s]  How come I can't pickaxe?
[1544.01s -> 1546.62s]  We didn't get a ghost.
[1548.38s -> 1549.50s]  Is some stone not...
[1549.50s -> 1549.98s]  Is only the...
[1551.50s -> 1554.86s]  Yeah, you can't do the black, gray stone.
[1554.86s -> 1555.18s]  I got it.
[1555.18s -> 1557.82s]  This song absolutely fucking just is...
[1558.62s -> 1559.34s]  Slaps.
[1559.34s -> 1562.62s]  Yeah, I was trying to think of that word and I'm too old to know what it was.
[1566.06s -> 1567.58s]  Okay, we know who the real boomer is.
[1570.78s -> 1574.54s]  Oh, you guys better be making a path.
[1575.82s -> 1576.46s]  We need wood.
[1576.46s -> 1577.02s]  I mean, we need...
[1577.02s -> 1577.90s]  Yeah, go for it.
[1579.42s -> 1584.01s]  You can't just see hanging out with some of your friends.
[1584.65s -> 1585.85s]  Just building a train track.
[1587.29s -> 1587.69s]  You could get this.
[1587.69s -> 1588.41s]  Oh, I put the wood in.
[1589.53s -> 1590.73s]  We need stone.
[1591.53s -> 1592.33s]  Where is it?
[1592.33s -> 1592.97s]  I've been hitting it.
[1594.09s -> 1597.54s]  Okay, we're bringing you the torch.
[1597.54s -> 1599.78s]  You guys just want to make like a super big path.
[1599.78s -> 1601.06s]  Don't leave all the tools back here.
[1602.02s -> 1602.98s]  Across the wall.
[1602.98s -> 1604.26s]  Uh-oh, we're on fire.
[1604.58s -> 1605.14s]  I'll handle it.
[1606.46s -> 1607.02s]  I'm the oldest.
[1607.02s -> 1607.58s]  I'll handle it.
[1608.22s -> 1614.39s]  Okay, we...
[1614.39s -> 1615.75s]  Yeah, we just go through the stone.
[1616.39s -> 1617.99s]  Yeah, we have to start stoning.
[1617.99s -> 1618.63s]  We need stone.
[1619.43s -> 1620.63s]  Start stoning.
[1620.63s -> 1621.43s]  Start it.
[1621.43s -> 1621.91s]  I'm going.
[1621.91s -> 1623.51s]  We actually need wood to go...
[1626.15s -> 1627.03s]  You all right?
[1627.03s -> 1627.67s]  We need to go...
[1627.67s -> 1629.67s]  We need wood to go across this path here.
[1631.03s -> 1635.08s]  Gentlemen, we need wood.
[1636.68s -> 1637.96s]  Otherwise, this thing ain't going anywhere.
[1638.76s -> 1639.40s]  I'm wooding.
[1643.93s -> 1644.89s]  No.
[1644.89s -> 1647.54s]  Who's got the pick?
[1647.62s -> 1649.14s]  It's in front of you.
[1649.14s -> 1649.62s]  No, it's over...
[1649.62s -> 1651.38s]  We're stuck on the wrong side.
[1651.38s -> 1651.88s]  You got it.
[1656.98s -> 1657.94s]  Hey, what?
[1657.94s -> 1658.66s]  Can you say that again?
[1660.09s -> 1660.59s]  What?
[1661.45s -> 1662.25s]  No, say that again.
[1664.09s -> 1664.97s]  Don't make me do it.
[1664.97s -> 1665.47s]  I will.
[1666.09s -> 1670.44s]  Okay, can you guys do something?
[1670.44s -> 1670.92s]  We can't move.
[1670.92s -> 1671.88s]  I can't.
[1671.88s -> 1672.76s]  Literally can't.
[1676.36s -> 1677.80s]  Can you literally do something?
[1677.80s -> 1678.76s]  No, we can't do anything.
[1678.76s -> 1679.32s]  You have to build...
[1679.32s -> 1680.28s]  No, we're stuck on...
[1680.28s -> 1681.08s]  No, we lose.
[1681.08s -> 1681.72s]  You have to do the whole thing.
[1682.60s -> 1683.64s]  You have to do it all.
[1683.64s -> 1684.44s]  We're about to lose.
[1685.48s -> 1687.13s]  Oh my god.
[1687.13s -> 1688.33s]  He's just still chopping.
[1689.93s -> 1691.13s]  He can't hear us.
[1691.13s -> 1693.69s]  Well, you kept picking up the fucking thing.
[1695.69s -> 1697.53s]  I tried to come back there and get things.
[1697.53s -> 1698.17s]  And you had...
[1698.17s -> 1698.89s]  You picked them.
[1700.09s -> 1700.97s]  Look how easy that was.
[1700.97s -> 1701.77s]  We need a shitload of wood.
[1702.33s -> 1704.09s]  I'm going to fucking scream.
[1704.09s -> 1705.61s]  We need a shitload of wood now.
[1706.89s -> 1708.71s]  In front of us.
[1708.71s -> 1717.99s]  I'm just getting wood.
[1719.16s -> 1721.72s]  You have a clear path to the next area, Ghost.
[1721.72s -> 1722.22s]  Fire!
[1722.22s -> 1722.72s]  We're stuck.
[1724.22s -> 1724.72s]  Where's the...
[1725.66s -> 1726.16s]  I got it.
[1727.34s -> 1730.68s]  We need a pickaxe.
[1734.27s -> 1738.57s]  Dude, Star, how could you not have made a rubber ducky joke here?
[1738.57s -> 1738.97s]  Come on.
[1738.97s -> 1739.77s]  Isn't that your thing?
[1739.77s -> 1741.37s]  We need to have a track build.
[1743.61s -> 1744.97s]  Are these cows going to get in the way?
[1746.65s -> 1747.15s]  Kill them.
[1748.01s -> 1749.34s]  Wait, why are you going that way?
[1750.06s -> 1751.02s]  Because that's the station.
[1754.01s -> 1754.51s]  Kill them.
[1757.05s -> 1758.33s]  We need stone bat.
[1763.87s -> 1765.15s]  All right, I got you on stone.
[1767.88s -> 1769.08s]  This is too stressful.
[1769.72s -> 1772.36s]  It's actually less stressful than the last game so far.
[1782.86s -> 1783.36s]  All right.
[1783.58s -> 1784.08s]  Excuse me?
[1786.56s -> 1787.12s]  You can go up.
[1787.84s -> 1789.12s]  If you wanted to go up, that'd be good.
[1789.68s -> 1790.48s]  No, go straight across.
[1791.52s -> 1793.92s]  Well, you got to go up eventually because that's...
[1794.96s -> 1798.36s]  Yeah, but we just go up one here.
[1798.36s -> 1799.40s]  And it's all cleared.
[1800.36s -> 1802.20s]  Yeah, but like we can just go straight across.
[1803.80s -> 1805.13s]  Like this, ready?
[1807.23s -> 1810.09s]  All right, now we need wood.
[1810.09s -> 1811.05s]  Where's the axe?
[1811.77s -> 1813.36s]  I'm killing the cows with it.
[1814.76s -> 1816.20s]  That's great use of our materials.
[1816.20s -> 1817.16s]  We desperately need wood.
[1817.72s -> 1819.40s]  Good use of the materials.
[1819.40s -> 1820.76s]  You murdering animals.
[1820.76s -> 1821.26s]  Good.
[1821.72s -> 1824.28s]  I want to make sure our train doesn't hit a fucking cow.
[1825.72s -> 1828.80s]  Oh, there's gold down there at the bottom.
[1828.80s -> 1829.92s]  You see that shit?
[1829.92s -> 1830.64s]  They're actually...
[1830.64s -> 1831.44s]  What is that?
[1831.44s -> 1831.92s]  Wow, there's so much gold.
[1831.92s -> 1832.80s]  Turn it around.
[1832.80s -> 1833.36s]  Turn it around.
[1833.36s -> 1833.76s]  Turn it around.
[1833.76s -> 1834.26s]  Turn it around.
[1835.64s -> 1836.20s]  Turn this around.
[1836.92s -> 1837.64s]  I think...
[1837.64s -> 1839.88s]  Do we just need to pick it up or does the train need to pass?
[1839.88s -> 1841.32s]  Train has to hit it for sure.
[1841.32s -> 1841.88s]  How do you know?
[1841.88s -> 1842.52s]  How do you know?
[1843.96s -> 1844.84s]  That has to be what this is.
[1844.84s -> 1846.52s]  How about we try the easier thing first?
[1849.20s -> 1849.70s]  All right.
[1850.08s -> 1850.58s]  Chop.
[1851.04s -> 1860.75s]  Gotta get the upgrade map.
[1860.75s -> 1861.63s]  How are we going to...
[1861.63s -> 1863.15s]  Oh my god, you just turned it...
[1863.15s -> 1863.71s]  No, no, no.
[1863.71s -> 1864.67s]  Don't do that.
[1864.67s -> 1865.71s]  You're doing it right.
[1865.71s -> 1866.11s]  No, no, no.
[1866.11s -> 1867.39s]  Because it has to cross.
[1867.39s -> 1868.59s]  How are we going to put it back the right way?
[1868.59s -> 1869.15s]  The old track.
[1869.15s -> 1870.35s]  Yeah, we can pick the old track.
[1870.35s -> 1870.85s]  Yep.
[1871.71s -> 1882.03s]  Oh, you can make some big stacks.
[1882.03s -> 1882.53s]  Fire.
[1883.95s -> 1884.51s]  Fire.
[1884.51s -> 1885.01s]  Fire.
[1885.01s -> 1885.71s]  Oh shit, I got it.
[1885.71s -> 1886.21s]  I got it.
[1889.39s -> 1889.89s]  Oh.
[1890.91s -> 1893.79s]  All right, I need regular old wood.
[1893.79s -> 1894.35s]  Regular wood.
[1894.35s -> 1895.07s]  There's quick...
[1895.07s -> 1896.03s]  On the board here.
[1896.03s -> 1896.83s]  Make a path.
[1899.45s -> 1901.05s]  You gotta hurry or it's gonna cut us off.
[1902.41s -> 1903.37s]  You gotta do it from the other way.
[1904.41s -> 1913.26s]  All right, now we need wood inside the train.
[1913.90s -> 1914.40s]  Okay.
[1915.42s -> 1916.30s]  Okay, I picked it up.
[1916.30s -> 1917.50s]  The train doesn't need to touch it.
[1918.38s -> 1919.10s]  Wait, you got it?
[1919.10s -> 1919.74s]  Fuck you guys.
[1919.74s -> 1920.22s]  Yeah, I got it.
[1920.22s -> 1920.70s]  Okay, wait, wait.
[1920.70s -> 1921.34s]  Hold on, hold on.
[1921.34s -> 1922.06s]  I told you.
[1923.02s -> 1924.22s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[1924.22s -> 1927.34s]  Now we can't pick up the track.
[1929.28s -> 1934.17s]  Uh oh, we can't pick up the track.
[1934.17s -> 1934.67s]  No.
[1935.05s -> 1936.65s]  What happens if you loop it in on itself?
[1937.61s -> 1938.41s]  Put one in between.
[1941.00s -> 1942.04s]  No, put one on the other side.
[1944.27s -> 1944.99s]  Oh, you can't.
[1947.20s -> 1947.70s]  Ah.
[1951.45s -> 1953.37s]  Yeah, you can't pick it up after it goes over the track.
[1953.37s -> 1954.33s]  We're going up.
[1954.33s -> 1954.83s]  No.
[1956.01s -> 1958.00s]  Can we go to the bottom?
[1958.00s -> 1958.80s]  Can we get through?
[1961.29s -> 1961.79s]  Hold on.
[1963.88s -> 1964.84s]  We can't get through this.
[1964.84s -> 1965.48s]  You fucked us.
[1966.60s -> 1969.48s]  Well, it seemed reasonable that the train would have to pass over.
[1969.48s -> 1971.16s]  No, just check first.
[1971.16s -> 1973.16s]  Because you have to build the bridge no matter what.
[1973.16s -> 1975.72s]  And we had like seven stacks of wood.
[1975.72s -> 1978.76s]  You could have built the bridge over there with your axe and checked it for us.
[1978.76s -> 1979.88s]  I'm not giving up yet.
[1979.88s -> 1980.52s]  Don't give up yet.
[1980.52s -> 1981.02s]  Hold on.
[1983.72s -> 1984.22s]  Oops.
[1984.68s -> 1985.56s]  Okay, you're going to yell at me.
[1985.56s -> 1987.56s]  I'm the one who fucking noticed it in the first place.
[1987.56s -> 1991.16s]  You fucking entitled, spoiled brat.
[1991.16s -> 1992.92s]  If Star hadn't have noticed the golden nugget,
[1992.92s -> 1994.12s]  then we wouldn't have even gone for it.
[1994.12s -> 1996.44s]  And we would have still been training to the right.
[1996.44s -> 1997.24s]  I saw it.
[1997.24s -> 1999.32s]  And I said, build a bridge first.
[1999.32s -> 2001.64s]  And then Jerma said, no, turn the train.
[2001.64s -> 2003.88s]  And then I fucking spit in his coffee.
[2006.28s -> 2007.16s]  That's my secret.
[2007.16s -> 2009.32s]  My coffee is exclusively made out of spit.
[2010.99s -> 2011.55s]  All right.
[2011.55s -> 2012.11s]  Try again.
[2012.99s -> 2014.60s]  All right.
[2014.60s -> 2016.04s]  Do we have to hide everything?
[2016.04s -> 2016.68s]  I don't think so.
[2018.20s -> 2019.24s]  Why'd you leave?
[2019.24s -> 2020.28s]  I fucked up, dude.
[2020.28s -> 2021.08s]  I fucked up.
[2021.08s -> 2022.44s]  Have you ever fucked up before?
[2027.07s -> 2027.31s]  No.
[2027.31s -> 2027.95s]  Would you leave?
[2030.24s -> 2030.74s]  No.
[2033.58s -> 2034.54s]  Hide everything again.
[2035.18s -> 2036.22s]  Give us a session ID.
[2037.18s -> 2038.80s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[2038.80s -> 2042.16s]  You have to press a hotkey for a session ID.
[2042.16s -> 2043.28s]  We had progress.
[2043.84s -> 2045.76s]  Dude, it's way past my bedtime.
[2045.76s -> 2047.44s]  If anyone here is going to complain, it's me.
[2047.44s -> 2049.68s]  Yeah, but this game is very fun, though.
[2049.68s -> 2050.88s]  This is fun.
[2050.88s -> 2052.00s]  I was on easy.
[2052.96s -> 2054.32s]  And we got one checkpoint.
[2054.32s -> 2054.96s]  That was not easy.
[2054.96s -> 2056.16s]  Turn it up to hard mode.
[2056.16s -> 2056.88s]  Put it on hard, then.
[2058.78s -> 2059.26s]  We can't.
[2060.06s -> 2060.86s]  You know we can't.
[2062.22s -> 2063.34s]  Then do it on medium.
[2063.34s -> 2067.92s]  But you may have to make the seed something fun.
[2068.00s -> 2069.36s]  No, that is something fun.
[2071.15s -> 2071.79s]  Krungus?
[2071.79s -> 2073.55s]  The last time I touched the seed, it, like,
[2074.19s -> 2074.91s]  freeze my game.
[2076.48s -> 2078.00s]  All right, we're good.
[2078.00s -> 2078.72s]  Who's making it?
[2079.28s -> 2080.16s]  He's got the code.
[2080.96s -> 2082.00s]  There, I made it.
[2082.00s -> 2082.56s]  We're in here.
[2083.44s -> 2083.94s]  Oh.
[2084.48s -> 2085.68s]  I'm Skullman again.
[2088.99s -> 2090.51s]  All right, I'm joining.
[2090.51s -> 2091.71s]  Yeah, why would you join?
[2091.71s -> 2093.31s]  Look, well, now we understand how the game works.
[2094.62s -> 2095.12s]  I don't.
[2095.74s -> 2098.48s]  But you can kill it.
[2098.48s -> 2100.00s]  You figured out how to kill cows.
[2100.00s -> 2100.50s]  Yeah.
[2101.26s -> 2102.30s]  And stop touching!
[2102.30s -> 2103.74s]  We had it ready, like, a minute ago,
[2103.74s -> 2105.34s]  and you come in here and start touching shit.
[2105.34s -> 2106.22s]  All right, but you can play on,
[2106.22s -> 2107.82s]  you can play with checkpoints, though.
[2107.82s -> 2110.54s]  You can restart at the first station in each biome.
[2110.54s -> 2112.62s]  But he left the game because he's,
[2112.62s -> 2113.82s]  just, something wrong with him.
[2113.82s -> 2115.98s]  I didn't want to do the same map again, okay?
[2115.98s -> 2117.26s]  Let's go, Taleks!
[2118.46s -> 2122.70s]  Playing on medium.
[2122.70s -> 2123.20s]  Here we go.
[2123.82s -> 2129.42s]  All right, pick a tool.
[2129.42s -> 2130.62s]  Probably eats his stakes for catching.
[2130.62s -> 2131.90s]  I'll build the track.
[2132.78s -> 2133.82s]  Keep the tool in your hand.
[2135.90s -> 2137.18s]  Let's do this efficiently, okay?
[2137.18s -> 2139.90s]  Okay, I'm just gonna break every single one of these blocks.
[2140.46s -> 2141.82s]  Well, I can't say blocks.
[2142.70s -> 2143.26s]  How about this?
[2144.06s -> 2146.38s]  We're gonna get so many resources in this first area.
[2146.38s -> 2148.70s]  Jerma is just the pick up resources
[2148.70s -> 2150.30s]  and then put the track down.
[2150.30s -> 2151.34s]  And we just chop.
[2151.90s -> 2153.18s]  Jerma's already using...
[2153.18s -> 2154.06s]  I'm resourceful.
[2154.06s -> 2155.02s]  I'm pickaxe up top.
[2155.90s -> 2158.32s]  And once you connect it, I'm gonna go chop the other side.
[2158.32s -> 2160.00s]  Okay, I need some help putting that stone in.
[2161.04s -> 2163.16s]  Give me one more.
[2163.16s -> 2164.92s]  Get one more across or we're gonna die.
[2165.96s -> 2170.42s]  Keep me!
[2171.36s -> 2173.50s]  Oh, we gotta do this quick.
[2173.50s -> 2174.00s]  Yeah.
[2174.62s -> 2175.26s]  It's on medium.
[2176.06s -> 2179.44s]  You thought hard was gonna be workful?
[2180.08s -> 2180.81s]  Could you not?
[2181.45s -> 2189.04s]  All right, gold nugget in the waterfall on the top.
[2190.08s -> 2191.28s]  Okay, turn the train, turn the train.
[2193.12s -> 2193.60s]  I'll go get it.
[2193.60s -> 2195.92s]  I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[2195.92s -> 2197.20s]  All right, you need to make some extra bridges
[2197.20s -> 2198.00s]  or you're stuck over here.
[2199.52s -> 2201.44s]  I need some wood to get that gold piece.
[2202.56s -> 2204.57s]  Follow me, I'm chopping all of it.
[2205.45s -> 2208.84s]  Sorry, there must be water in the bucket.
[2210.56s -> 2211.44s]  There was.
[2211.44s -> 2212.32s]  The flame is out.
[2212.32s -> 2212.82s]  What the fuck?
[2212.82s -> 2213.32s]  What the fuck, dude?
[2219.52s -> 2221.52s]  We need a bridge here or shit's about to get real bad.
[2221.52s -> 2222.72s]  We need a track here.
[2222.72s -> 2224.08s]  Uh-oh, it's about to get real bad.
[2224.08s -> 2226.80s]  And we can't bring the track unless you put some wood here
[2226.80s -> 2228.72s]  and you're the master of all of the woods.
[2230.32s -> 2232.66s]  You need to chop this tree, you need to chop this tree.
[2235.14s -> 2236.18s]  Chop, chop.
[2236.18s -> 2237.14s]  All right, that's not mean.
[2239.66s -> 2240.94s]  No, no, we need that pickaxe.
[2242.22s -> 2244.06s]  Back up, back up pickaxe.
[2244.06s -> 2245.66s]  I have the track.
[2245.66s -> 2247.26s]  And the water bucket, dude.
[2248.14s -> 2249.42s]  Dude, dude.
[2251.12s -> 2252.16s]  Oh my God.
[2252.16s -> 2253.36s]  Get the water bucket.
[2254.24s -> 2260.19s]  All right, I'm going to put these ahead of us.
[2260.75s -> 2262.46s]  How about these?
[2276.05s -> 2279.78s]  We're going to drive the train.
[2281.86s -> 2282.90s]  The gold piece.
[2286.11s -> 2292.51s]  We're going to need some mining.
[2293.23s -> 2294.27s]  And I'm going for it.
[2296.64s -> 2297.92s]  Train's turning too wide.
[2301.44s -> 2301.94s]  Fire up.
[2303.17s -> 2303.81s]  Train's on fire.
[2303.81s -> 2304.31s]  Here we go.
[2306.48s -> 2306.96s]  We're good.
[2306.96s -> 2307.92s]  Checkpoint one.
[2307.92s -> 2308.42s]  Done.
[2308.88s -> 2311.83s]  Oh, easy this was.
[2313.91s -> 2315.51s]  One more track.
[2316.23s -> 2318.08s]  And we can say we did it.
[2319.04s -> 2321.54s]  And let's actually put our points in something cool this time
[2321.54s -> 2323.86s]  rather than something, uh, stupid.
[2323.86s -> 2325.70s]  Honestly, the things that we did were not bad.
[2325.70s -> 2327.14s]  It was very helpful.
[2327.14s -> 2328.34s]  With three bolts, we only had two.
[2328.34s -> 2328.84s]  They were good.
[2329.86s -> 2332.42s]  Oh, by the way, it's not a gold piece you pick up.
[2332.42s -> 2333.70s]  You pick it, it's a bolt.
[2333.70s -> 2334.42s]  I know.
[2334.42s -> 2335.46s]  They're so important, holy shit.
[2335.46s -> 2336.58s]  It's a piece of bolt.
[2338.37s -> 2340.61s]  Convert raw materials to track.
[2340.61s -> 2341.73s]  This is just another one.
[2341.73s -> 2342.37s]  What did you just get?
[2343.33s -> 2346.28s]  I'm supposed to come to it.
[2346.28s -> 2347.56s]  Increases this.
[2347.56s -> 2349.08s]  I don't know what he got actually.
[2349.08s -> 2350.36s]  Yeah, I got increased size.
[2351.64s -> 2352.12s]  Come on.
[2352.12s -> 2352.84s]  It's important.
[2352.84s -> 2355.00s]  Well, there's two that look the same, but they're not the same.
[2355.00s -> 2356.76s]  It's pretty sure you got the right one.
[2356.76s -> 2357.48s]  Dynamite?
[2357.48s -> 2358.36s]  Plus two size.
[2359.32s -> 2360.50s]  Dynamite might be fun.
[2361.22s -> 2362.74s]  Auto mine commodities.
[2362.74s -> 2363.46s]  That's pretty.
[2363.46s -> 2364.66s]  That sounds pretty good.
[2364.66s -> 2366.66s]  But we spent all the bolts already.
[2366.66s -> 2368.82s]  So I'll put it.
[2369.14s -> 2371.06s]  Germa just spent the bolt.
[2371.06s -> 2373.54s]  I'm glad we came to consensus.
[2374.26s -> 2376.92s]  That's why it auto mines things around it.
[2377.80s -> 2378.60s]  That's like a no brainer.
[2378.60s -> 2379.48s]  That's the first one you should get.
[2380.76s -> 2387.27s]  But when you put it at the front then, instead of the back?
[2390.34s -> 2391.46s]  It doesn't matter.
[2391.46s -> 2392.18s]  What's the radius?
[2393.75s -> 2394.87s]  Can you reorganize?
[2395.83s -> 2399.38s]  It should be right here next to the water tank.
[2401.40s -> 2402.36s]  He just does things.
[2402.36s -> 2403.16s]  All right, let's go.
[2404.50s -> 2405.22s]  You're a little brother.
[2405.22s -> 2405.86s]  He just did it.
[2406.66s -> 2410.98s]  See if we can get two checkpoints.
[2411.94s -> 2414.10s]  And he presses the button and you're like, okay,
[2414.10s -> 2415.78s]  I guess that's how we're going to play.
[2415.78s -> 2420.10s]  And I just get my finger jammed almost to the palm of my hand up my nose.
[2421.70s -> 2423.36s]  We going straight?
[2425.76s -> 2426.26s]  Yes.
[2439.86s -> 2440.82s]  Look, it's auto mining.
[2442.24s -> 2443.60s]  I actually can't tell what this is doing.
[2446.13s -> 2448.85s]  Now it's an awkward space between where the track comes out
[2448.85s -> 2450.45s]  and where the track ingredients go in.
[2450.45s -> 2453.81s]  What are the two hamburger buns?
[2453.81s -> 2454.31s]  What does that mean?
[2455.25s -> 2461.04s]  Which way do you want to take this?
[2461.68s -> 2465.89s]  I'm just getting material.
[2465.89s -> 2469.17s]  Go south and go across the water or go north and go through all the trees.
[2469.17s -> 2470.93s]  I think we just go through all the stuff.
[2470.93s -> 2471.49s]  Forget about the water.
[2471.49s -> 2473.41s]  I don't think the auto miner is doing anything.
[2474.85s -> 2475.81s]  Yeah, let's go through the trees.
[2476.61s -> 2479.33s]  Maybe it's got ingredients in there and you have to take them out.
[2479.33s -> 2480.05s]  Feed it stone.
[2480.85s -> 2481.57s]  Put stone in it.
[2481.57s -> 2486.87s]  All right, I'm making a turn.
[2486.87s -> 2487.35s]  You're right.
[2487.35s -> 2489.03s]  You don't really have any spare stone.
[2489.91s -> 2490.95s]  We have a lot of it up here.
[2492.32s -> 2493.04s]  Turn south.
[2493.04s -> 2495.12s]  We need trees.
[2497.89s -> 2499.81s]  Yeah, OK, it takes.
[2499.81s -> 2506.90s]  You have to use two stone to turn it on and turn it off.
[2508.15s -> 2509.59s]  Are we going straight or are we going?
[2509.59s -> 2510.55s]  We're just going straight, right?
[2510.55s -> 2511.11s]  Go across the water.
[2511.83s -> 2512.85s]  So we're going down.
[2513.81s -> 2516.87s]  Yeah, go well.
[2516.87s -> 2521.97s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[2522.77s -> 2525.91s]  Where's the pickaxe?
[2526.72s -> 2527.60s]  I'm using it.
[2527.60s -> 2528.10s]  All right.
[2534.92s -> 2536.52s]  Are those birds shitting on it?
[2536.52s -> 2546.16s]  I'm going to fill up the tank.
[2546.16s -> 2549.52s]  So I think you can preemptively cool the engine with water every so often
[2549.52s -> 2551.76s]  without having to wait for it to catch on fire.
[2551.76s -> 2554.32s]  Oh, shit, this stuff actually, it does do this.
[2555.20s -> 2556.08s]  That's actually pretty sick.
[2557.60s -> 2560.64s]  Yeah, it cuts down all like everything around it as long as it's got power.
[2560.64s -> 2561.92s]  Why do we get this weird haze?
[2562.96s -> 2564.24s]  It's called fog.
[2564.24s -> 2566.64s]  I know you only see when you go outside, but we're not used to that.
[2566.64s -> 2567.76s]  What's going on with this track?
[2568.72s -> 2571.91s]  What's going on with the track?
[2572.87s -> 2573.35s]  Why did that?
[2579.83s -> 2581.43s]  Wait, are we making it go?
[2581.43s -> 2582.07s]  What are we doing?
[2582.87s -> 2586.23s]  I would really like to pick this squiggle track up, but it's fine.
[2586.23s -> 2586.73s]  Oh, OK.
[2586.73s -> 2587.23s]  OK.
[2590.52s -> 2592.95s]  Don't lose that bucket of water.
[2598.57s -> 2599.37s]  I'll turn the train around.
[2599.37s -> 2600.01s]  We missed something.
[2600.89s -> 2603.05s]  All right.
[2603.05s -> 2604.33s]  Get a stack of wood over here.
[2607.32s -> 2607.82s]  Fire.
[2608.82s -> 2609.78s]  Oh, it's getting dark.
[2610.98s -> 2611.48s]  Shit.
[2612.10s -> 2612.90s]  There's the bucket.
[2612.90s -> 2613.86s]  Shit.
[2613.86s -> 2614.36s]  Dark.
[2614.98s -> 2615.46s]  Shit.
[2615.46s -> 2616.26s]  Get a stack of wood.
[2616.82s -> 2617.46s]  Stack of wood.
[2617.46s -> 2617.96s]  What?
[2618.90s -> 2619.70s]  We got to make track.
[2620.42s -> 2621.14s]  You got to get over here.
[2622.26s -> 2623.14s]  I'm chopping wood.
[2623.14s -> 2623.94s]  Just get the wood.
[2623.94s -> 2624.26s]  I got it.
[2624.26s -> 2625.14s]  OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.
[2627.10s -> 2627.58s]  All right, start.
[2628.54s -> 2630.38s]  This is why I didn't want to come over here.
[2630.38s -> 2631.82s]  This is why I didn't want to come over.
[2631.82s -> 2633.90s]  Now pick it up and bring it over here.
[2637.10s -> 2637.58s]  Thank you.
[2639.82s -> 2640.54s]  Chopping wood.
[2641.90s -> 2643.58s]  This is going to be cutting it close.
[2643.58s -> 2644.94s]  OK, we need, I need.
[2654.52s -> 2655.40s]  I'm chopping wood.
[2656.28s -> 2665.75s]  Where's the, are we going up?
[2667.11s -> 2669.03s]  That's a decision for you guys to make.
[2669.03s -> 2670.15s]  All right, we're going up.
[2670.15s -> 2671.27s]  We're following him.
[2671.27s -> 2671.91s]  Already is.
[2671.99s -> 2673.19s]  I got to kill these boys.
[2678.33s -> 2679.37s]  Wood's more important right now.
[2681.66s -> 2683.35s]  We don't lose any tools.
[2683.35s -> 2684.23s]  I'm moving the bucket up here.
[2688.98s -> 2692.22s]  Oops.
[2692.92s -> 2694.20s]  Oh, tallax.
[2695.40s -> 2696.04s]  Oh.
[2696.04s -> 2697.80s]  To be fair, it doesn't highlight.
[2697.80s -> 2698.60s]  Is that going to crash?
[2698.60s -> 2699.10s]  Yeah.
[2700.12s -> 2700.62s]  No.
[2700.92s -> 2702.95s]  All right, we need stone.
[2706.52s -> 2707.16s]  Don't get caught.
[2708.90s -> 2709.40s]  Uh oh.
[2711.98s -> 2713.90s]  OK, just keep the train going straight.
[2713.90s -> 2714.46s]  Look at what we're about to run into.
[2714.46s -> 2715.58s]  You can't dig that stone,
[2715.58s -> 2716.62s]  person trying to dig this.
[2716.62s -> 2717.18s]  I'm not.
[2717.18s -> 2718.46s]  I'm trying to have visibility
[2718.46s -> 2719.66s]  so we can see ahead of us,
[2719.66s -> 2721.18s]  not dig the stone.
[2721.18s -> 2722.54s]  Hey, person trying to dig the stone.
[2724.06s -> 2727.50s]  All right, we need some extra pass to walk.
[2727.50s -> 2735.21s]  OK, we need a lot of wood.
[2735.21s -> 2736.41s]  All right, we got to go.
[2736.41s -> 2739.06s]  We got a big, big wood path going south.
[2739.06s -> 2740.02s]  I'm going to keep chopping.
[2740.02s -> 2741.14s]  I'm not going to stop chopping.
[2741.14s -> 2742.74s]  Don't expect me to do anything but chop.
[2743.38s -> 2743.88s]  OK.
[2744.82s -> 2746.42s]  What about, uh, we don't have any stone.
[2748.89s -> 2749.39s]  Just don't.
[2751.70s -> 2754.18s]  Quick, we're running out of, we're running out of stone.
[2755.10s -> 2755.66s]  I got it.
[2758.79s -> 2760.39s]  We're going to have a big problem here in a second.
[2760.39s -> 2763.51s]  Big problem incoming.
[2763.51s -> 2764.01s]  Stone.
[2765.35s -> 2768.78s]  Stone.
[2768.78s -> 2770.22s]  I'm making stone.
[2770.22s -> 2770.72s]  Fire.
[2771.66s -> 2775.28s]  Bucket.
[2775.82s -> 2776.98s]  Oh no, I'm getting stuck.
[2777.70s -> 2778.58s]  Bucket's up there, we're good.
[2779.38s -> 2780.26s]  Um, I don't know what to do.
[2781.38s -> 2783.00s]  There's bolts at the top,
[2783.00s -> 2787.00s]  so don't connect the last piece of track until you have to.
[2795.22s -> 2797.46s]  Actually, I don't think there's trees for us to get it.
[2797.46s -> 2798.34s]  Is there not enough trees?
[2799.30s -> 2800.50s]  Hold on.
[2800.50s -> 2801.00s]  It might be.
[2801.78s -> 2802.73s]  I got it, I got it.
[2802.73s -> 2803.37s]  We're doing it.
[2803.37s -> 2803.93s]  I got it, I got it.
[2803.93s -> 2804.43s]  You guys do this.
[2805.45s -> 2807.37s]  I'm trying to get this thing.
[2807.37s -> 2808.81s]  I need, like, one more piece.
[2808.81s -> 2810.49s]  Can I die if I don't move?
[2810.49s -> 2811.69s]  Is it OK if I connect it?
[2811.69s -> 2812.19s]  I don't know.
[2813.21s -> 2814.25s]  Uh, don't do it yet.
[2815.13s -> 2816.49s]  Because if you connect it, it finishes.
[2818.01s -> 2821.29s]  And then we can't build up materials and stuff.
[2821.29s -> 2822.89s]  What do you, oh, there's a golden ticket.
[2830.98s -> 2832.82s]  We need more wood for that.
[2837.58s -> 2838.86s]  We're going to need another track.
[2838.86s -> 2841.10s]  Track is right to the top of you, Stark.
[2841.10s -> 2841.90s]  OK.
[2841.90s -> 2842.14s]  Wood?
[2842.14s -> 2843.02s]  How much more do we have?
[2843.02s -> 2843.74s]  Hold on, hold on.
[2844.46s -> 2845.50s]  It's not enough.
[2845.50s -> 2846.30s]  It's not enough.
[2846.30s -> 2846.78s]  It's not enough.
[2846.78s -> 2847.26s]  It's not enough.
[2847.26s -> 2848.46s]  How do we get more wood?
[2848.46s -> 2849.26s]  We need one wood.
[2850.54s -> 2851.10s]  Is there a tree?
[2851.10s -> 2852.46s]  We'll be able to do it after it parks.
[2853.61s -> 2857.86s]  Periodically, I hope.
[2857.86s -> 2862.04s]  That's not an all-in-one spot.
[2862.04s -> 2862.60s]  All right.
[2862.60s -> 2864.04s]  I'm just going to buy a random thing.
[2864.84s -> 2867.56s]  We only have one bolt, so I really, we could just save.
[2868.60s -> 2873.83s]  Why not just save?
[2874.47s -> 2876.47s]  I want crafting speed stack side.
[2877.74s -> 2879.26s]  That's not that's not bad, actually.
[2879.98s -> 2880.86s]  Put it in a good spot.
[2880.86s -> 2881.50s]  Don't do what I do.
[2882.38s -> 2883.58s]  That's not great.
[2883.58s -> 2885.66s]  So it's the same speed stack size.
[2885.66s -> 2888.22s]  We were not once waiting on the track.
[2888.78s -> 2889.26s]  What have you done?
[2890.14s -> 2893.48s]  Stack size is nice because then you can take stuff
[2893.48s -> 2896.20s]  because we always have like a full stack of shit in here.
[2898.95s -> 2899.99s]  It works out.
[2899.99s -> 2903.83s]  I mean, you could if we saved, you can actually make the auto miner like good.
[2903.83s -> 2906.34s]  Let's go.
[2907.30s -> 2909.06s]  Plus two range on the auto miner.
[2909.62s -> 2911.24s]  I mean, that's pretty good, too.
[2912.97s -> 2913.77s]  We only have one bolt.
[2914.71s -> 2916.47s]  Ghost wagon and dynamite are the best.
[2918.06s -> 2919.50s]  Also a better craft.
[2919.50s -> 2921.74s]  Like you can get a second raw material wagon.
[2922.62s -> 2925.10s]  OK, but we only had one bolt and now we have no bolts.
[2925.82s -> 2927.02s]  What does this let you die?
[2929.13s -> 2930.41s]  What does the ghost wagon do?
[2930.41s -> 2933.27s]  You die, you go to the other side.
[2933.27s -> 2933.75s]  What does that mean?
[2937.11s -> 2937.99s]  We can still get that.
[2940.54s -> 2943.26s]  Yeah, we can wrap around and get it.
[2943.26s -> 2944.22s]  We could just walk to it.
[2944.22s -> 2944.78s]  Holy shit.
[2944.78s -> 2945.50s]  Yeah, just walk.
[2945.50s -> 2946.30s]  Oh, man.
[2946.30s -> 2947.26s]  We could just walk to it.
[2948.66s -> 2951.66s]  We could just walk to it.
[2951.66s -> 2954.22s]  We need to work pretty fast because we're in this awkward.
[2955.02s -> 2959.34s]  Yeah, I'm trying to dig wide so we have some space to move.
[2960.86s -> 2967.59s]  There's a bunch of stone on the other side of the river, too.
[2967.59s -> 2967.99s]  Isn't it?
[2967.99s -> 2968.87s]  You can just build stone.
[2968.87s -> 2969.51s]  We don't need stone.
[2969.51s -> 2973.96s]  Ram on this thing on.
[2976.39s -> 2976.79s]  All right.
[2978.31s -> 2979.11s]  Oh, fuck.
[2979.83s -> 2980.39s]  Oh, fuck.
[2980.39s -> 2980.79s]  Oh, fuck.
[2980.79s -> 2982.07s]  It's fucking great.
[2982.07s -> 2983.27s]  I can't reach it.
[2983.27s -> 2983.67s]  Hold on.
[2983.67s -> 2985.27s]  I can't move.
[2985.27s -> 2994.26s]  I was not involved in that.
[2995.14s -> 2995.70s]  I panicked.
[2995.70s -> 2996.10s]  I'm sorry.
[2998.90s -> 3001.77s]  Who are these bandits?
[3002.33s -> 3003.56s]  I don't know.
[3003.56s -> 3004.36s]  I've been killing them.
[3006.65s -> 3011.08s]  I think they steal your stuff if you let them probably.
[3011.64s -> 3011.80s]  All right.
[3011.80s -> 3012.44s]  We're going to double up.
[3014.74s -> 3017.06s]  We still have access, by the way, to the pickaxe.
[3017.06s -> 3017.38s]  Where is it?
[3017.38s -> 3017.62s]  Okay.
[3018.98s -> 3023.54s]  What do we need?
[3024.18s -> 3024.82s]  Any tracks?
[3024.82s -> 3025.38s]  Make some calls.
[3025.38s -> 3025.78s]  Make some calls.
[3025.78s -> 3026.18s]  What do we need?
[3027.14s -> 3027.94s]  I got it.
[3027.94s -> 3031.54s]  We're going to go follow the rubber ducky.
[3032.34s -> 3034.18s]  Or just follow where he's digging right now.
[3035.38s -> 3040.65s]  We need stone delivered.
[3048.07s -> 3049.03s]  We got wood and stone.
[3049.03s -> 3049.43s]  There you go.
[3049.43s -> 3049.99s]  We got wood.
[3050.71s -> 3051.11s]  All right.
[3051.11s -> 3051.35s]  Dig.
[3052.31s -> 3053.99s]  I'm going to mine like a secondary path.
[3058.50s -> 3060.42s]  Each player has to mine a rock.
[3060.42s -> 3060.98s]  What did it say?
[3062.66s -> 3063.62s]  It's like an achievement thing.
[3064.58s -> 3066.79s]  All right.
[3066.79s -> 3067.75s]  We need to kill the cows.
[3069.90s -> 3070.94s]  They move out of the way.
[3070.94s -> 3071.50s]  You really don't.
[3071.50s -> 3075.18s]  No, I just wanted to kill some cows.
[3075.18s -> 3075.98s]  Put some stone in that machine.
[3075.98s -> 3076.62s]  It's so high up.
[3076.62s -> 3076.94s]  Beef.
[3078.06s -> 3080.57s]  All right.
[3080.57s -> 3081.29s]  Where's that pickaxe?
[3081.85s -> 3082.84s]  I got it.
[3083.40s -> 3084.50s]  Play down here, too.
[3087.70s -> 3087.94s]  What?
[3089.38s -> 3090.10s]  So we're going to have two paths.
[3092.33s -> 3093.05s]  What are you saying?
[3093.93s -> 3095.37s]  See the wooden path I made to the stone?
[3096.01s -> 3096.89s]  That's just more stone.
[3097.69s -> 3103.03s]  Well, we need to go forward.
[3104.47s -> 3104.63s]  Yeah.
[3104.63s -> 3105.99s]  The autominer's just got stuff.
[3109.26s -> 3110.86s]  Can we hit the cows or what?
[3111.74s -> 3113.10s]  No, they walk away from the track.
[3113.10s -> 3113.58s]  Walk away.
[3113.58s -> 3113.82s]  Okay.
[3114.62s -> 3118.66s]  All right.
[3118.66s -> 3119.38s]  We need trees.
[3120.26s -> 3121.86s]  We need this cut down up front.
[3121.86s -> 3123.38s]  And then we're pretty much there.
[3124.66s -> 3126.54s]  I'm going for the tree.
[3126.54s -> 3127.26s]  We got a bolt.
[3127.98s -> 3133.27s]  We'll let you do it.
[3133.91s -> 3135.30s]  Fire.
[3136.10s -> 3137.42s]  Oh, it's on fire.
[3137.42s -> 3138.22s]  Buckets right up.
[3138.22s -> 3138.86s]  Right on top, top.
[3138.86s -> 3139.66s]  Right next to the star.
[3139.66s -> 3140.14s]  No, it's out.
[3140.14s -> 3141.10s]  Who's penguin?
[3141.10s -> 3141.82s]  I'm penguin.
[3141.82s -> 3142.14s]  All right.
[3142.14s -> 3142.94s]  Talek's penguin.
[3142.94s -> 3143.58s]  Yeah, you got it.
[3144.78s -> 3145.26s]  All right.
[3145.26s -> 3146.94s]  There's an absolute shitload of materials down here.
[3147.58s -> 3148.62s]  Start collecting.
[3148.62s -> 3149.82s]  Feed the autominer.
[3155.90s -> 3156.14s]  Good.
[3156.14s -> 3156.70s]  It is looking good.
[3156.70s -> 3160.14s]  Well, don't waste resources on the autominer when it's not near anything.
[3161.11s -> 3164.15s]  Does it consume while it's not near anything, I wonder?
[3164.15s -> 3165.11s]  Yeah, it does.
[3165.11s -> 3167.03s]  You can see it digging up grass.
[3167.91s -> 3169.10s]  It's digging grass.
[3169.10s -> 3169.90s]  Well, then you can just take it off.
[3173.58s -> 3176.62s]  I wonder if there's upgrades so we can carry more stuff in our hands
[3177.66s -> 3178.38s]  because currently what?
[3178.38s -> 3179.02s]  It's two or three.
[3181.98s -> 3186.92s]  Make sure you don't leave any tools.
[3191.27s -> 3192.07s]  Looking good.
[3193.03s -> 3194.87s]  Do we have any secret loot?
[3195.43s -> 3196.33s]  There's one over here.
[3196.33s -> 3196.57s]  Behind.
[3196.57s -> 3197.13s]  We can get it later.
[3197.93s -> 3199.38s]  We're probably going to get it right now, actually.
[3200.10s -> 3201.14s]  How are we doing on track?
[3202.42s -> 3204.82s]  We got like a small stack back there.
[3204.82s -> 3206.02s]  We don't have a lot of wood.
[3206.66s -> 3207.62s]  So, yeah.
[3207.62s -> 3208.42s]  We're about to win.
[3210.44s -> 3213.08s]  There is so much stone that I put here.
[3213.88s -> 3219.98s]  I think there's enough to get both, isn't there?
[3221.48s -> 3222.12s]  Well, yeah, hold on.
[3222.12s -> 3222.92s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3222.92s -> 3223.40s]  Don't, don't, don't.
[3223.40s -> 3224.36s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[3224.36s -> 3226.20s]  Make sure we have enough track to complete the level.
[3229.18s -> 3230.14s]  This is more important.
[3230.14s -> 3230.70s]  I want gold.
[3231.10s -> 3234.89s]  No, I didn't.
[3240.74s -> 3241.86s]  Can I pick up the last two?
[3244.12s -> 3244.92s]  Fire.
[3244.92s -> 3246.07s]  Where's the bucket?
[3247.67s -> 3248.23s]  Where's the bucket?
[3249.70s -> 3250.42s]  Oh, it's not full.
[3251.32s -> 3252.12s]  Where's the bucket?
[3252.68s -> 3253.24s]  He's got it.
[3253.24s -> 3262.60s]  I'm doing it.
[3262.60s -> 3263.40s]  All right, we need one more.
[3264.66s -> 3266.34s]  Still on fire somehow.
[3268.18s -> 3269.14s]  Are we out of wood?
[3269.14s -> 3269.64s]  No.
[3271.30s -> 3273.66s]  We just need one more track.
[3275.10s -> 3277.03s]  All right, complete it.
[3277.99s -> 3278.49s]  Yeah.
[3279.11s -> 3279.61s]  All right.
[3281.64s -> 3282.36s]  Oh, yeah.
[3284.20s -> 3285.48s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[3285.48s -> 3287.00s]  Four fucking bolts.
[3287.88s -> 3290.04s]  All right, that could be a new engine if we wanted it.
[3291.24s -> 3292.84s]  What about the juice box?
[3295.92s -> 3298.96s]  Increases your strength for every animal you bring by.
[3301.95s -> 3303.31s]  That's carrying capacity.
[3304.96s -> 3305.92s]  Liquid storage?
[3307.60s -> 3309.36s]  You feed cows and you get juice?
[3309.36s -> 3311.04s]  Plus 100% capacity.
[3311.04s -> 3311.92s]  That's pretty good.
[3316.17s -> 3317.45s]  How do you do that?
[3317.45s -> 3320.33s]  All right, minor tier two.
[3321.05s -> 3323.52s]  Can I not move it ever?
[3325.12s -> 3326.08s]  How are you doing that, sir?
[3327.20s -> 3329.28s]  If you write your right analog stick,
[3329.28s -> 3331.76s]  you press it down, you can create waypoints.
[3331.76s -> 3332.64s]  It's kind of annoying.
[3333.44s -> 3337.29s]  And then left trigger and right trigger are emotes.
[3337.93s -> 3340.68s]  What did we buy?
[3343.26s -> 3345.42s]  I bought the minor expander.
[3345.42s -> 3347.42s]  If you're going to have it, it may as well do something.
[3347.42s -> 3349.66s]  What about halts the train for a short time,
[3349.66s -> 3351.50s]  dash into it to fill up its charge?
[3352.30s -> 3353.18s]  I don't know how to dash.
[3354.62s -> 3355.26s]  Dash is B.
[3357.44s -> 3360.08s]  Now we can knock each other off the bridge like in Overcooked 2.
[3360.08s -> 3361.92s]  Are we saving the points or what?
[3364.97s -> 3365.69s]  I vote for...
[3368.67s -> 3370.11s]  I'm down with the stack size.
[3370.11s -> 3371.55s]  Is that just the normal platform?
[3371.55s -> 3373.39s]  Halts the train for a short time,
[3374.19s -> 3375.71s]  dash into it to fill up its charge.
[3375.71s -> 3377.47s]  I feel like we're accidentally going to activate that.
[3378.11s -> 3378.91s]  Yeah, we probably are.
[3380.59s -> 3383.23s]  I kind of don't want our train to be longer right now
[3383.23s -> 3384.67s]  because we keep getting caught on it.
[3385.55s -> 3387.02s]  100% capacity.
[3389.37s -> 3390.09s]  We could save.
[3391.21s -> 3393.13s]  I mean, capacity is just capacity.
[3393.93s -> 3396.41s]  Well, that's for the water, right?
[3396.41s -> 3397.29s]  What is this thing for?
[3399.07s -> 3400.03s]  Executive decision.
[3400.59s -> 3401.63s]  What'd you grab?
[3401.63s -> 3406.01s]  What is that?
[3406.01s -> 3408.65s]  Now we're going to make track at a thousand times normal speed.
[3409.21s -> 3409.85s]  Yeah.
[3409.85s -> 3412.99s]  Wait, what was that one?
[3414.40s -> 3417.20s]  Increase the capacity and build speed for tracks.
[3417.20s -> 3418.08s]  Cool waypoints.
[3418.08s -> 3418.64s]  Pretty useful.
[3418.64s -> 3419.60s]  Plenty of track.
[3420.40s -> 3422.17s]  True.
[3422.81s -> 3425.34s]  All right.
[3425.34s -> 3428.22s]  I hope you guys are ready to start smashing some trees.
[3429.26s -> 3432.97s]  They delete all yours.
[3432.97s -> 3435.61s]  Oh, no, we got to go to water preemptively
[3435.61s -> 3437.29s]  just for when we need to douse it.
[3438.41s -> 3448.14s]  Capacity.
[3448.14s -> 3448.38s]  Good.
[3449.02s -> 3449.66s]  Cool.
[3449.66s -> 3450.14s]  Auto mine.
[3450.14s -> 3452.70s]  We're going to need to start mining stone up here.
[3453.74s -> 3456.70s]  Which way are we going?
[3456.70s -> 3457.98s]  Up or just to the right?
[3457.98s -> 3460.86s]  Up and then right.
[3460.86s -> 3464.41s]  What's up here?
[3465.45s -> 3466.49s]  Where's the stone?
[3466.49s -> 3467.85s]  You turn the track around.
[3468.49s -> 3469.53s]  Yeah, you hang on.
[3469.53s -> 3470.17s]  What are you talking about?
[3470.97s -> 3471.37s]  You did.
[3471.37s -> 3473.13s]  Yeah, that's not what you want to do.
[3480.64s -> 3482.64s]  You want to go like down and then over.
[3484.17s -> 3484.73s]  How do you do that?
[3484.73s -> 3485.29s]  And then right.
[3490.41s -> 3501.77s]  Well, we need to start talking trees.
[3502.89s -> 3508.97s]  You just turned it around.
[3509.61s -> 3510.73s]  Yeah, whatever.
[3510.73s -> 3512.81s]  Well, I thought you like doomed it again
[3512.81s -> 3514.33s]  that we couldn't remove the thing.
[3514.33s -> 3516.41s]  But I think a talent you removed.
[3516.41s -> 3517.05s]  I saved it.
[3517.69s -> 3519.53s]  You can remove it if it hasn't driven over it.
[3520.25s -> 3525.31s]  Oh, a ton of wood.
[3527.31s -> 3529.39s]  Like too much to even I don't know what to do with it.
[3530.43s -> 3535.68s]  There's no nothing.
[3535.68s -> 3541.15s]  No bridges to build a bucket of water.
[3553.28s -> 3554.48s]  Do more auto mining.
[3556.16s -> 3558.56s]  I feel like eventually that would be the best bet.
[3558.56s -> 3558.96s]  I think.
[3558.96s -> 3559.46s]  Right.
[3559.92s -> 3562.40s]  Let's just have a super auto miner and just build track.
[3563.52s -> 3569.07s]  All right.
[3569.07s -> 3572.67s]  Can you chop the trees that are going to go
[3573.23s -> 3574.75s]  adjacent to where we're building?
[3574.75s -> 3575.25s]  Yes.
[3577.34s -> 3580.78s]  Well, shouldn't we not because we keep doing that
[3580.78s -> 3583.02s]  and then the auto miner doesn't do anything.
[3583.02s -> 3585.74s]  Well, it should do something while it's next to all these rocks.
[3591.50s -> 3591.74s]  All right.
[3591.74s -> 3595.24s]  Speaking of rocks.
[3602.48s -> 3606.24s]  Yeah, that has to be that has to be this stone has to be in there
[3606.24s -> 3607.84s]  for it to auto mine in the first place.
[3607.84s -> 3609.60s]  How do you set those up from a distance?
[3611.40s -> 3611.90s]  Yeah.
[3614.30s -> 3615.82s]  You just click down right stick.
[3617.24s -> 3618.20s]  I'm trapped over here.
[3619.24s -> 3620.57s]  I need a wood cutter.
[3622.57s -> 3624.00s]  I can't help either.
[3633.36s -> 3634.40s]  That's auto mining now.
[3638.28s -> 3638.68s]  Wow.
[3638.68s -> 3639.56s]  That's insane.
[3645.39s -> 3650.70s]  This one was easy.
[3651.34s -> 3655.96s]  So you can pick up cows.
[3655.96s -> 3656.20s]  Okay.
[3656.20s -> 3657.00s]  We're on fire.
[3657.00s -> 3658.60s]  Bucket is off the screen.
[3662.59s -> 3663.07s]  Oh my God.
[3663.07s -> 3663.57s]  You got it.
[3667.08s -> 3667.88s]  That was close.
[3669.96s -> 3671.72s]  We need to chop down here.
[3672.60s -> 3673.88s]  What a good seed this was.
[3674.52s -> 3677.00s]  Quickly chop down here or else you're dead.
[3678.20s -> 3679.32s]  It's right next to you.
[3679.32s -> 3679.88s]  Where is it?
[3682.92s -> 3684.36s]  Oh, there is a way out anyway.
[3685.16s -> 3688.27s]  All right.
[3688.27s -> 3688.83s]  You still got it.
[3688.83s -> 3689.87s]  You still got to chop up there.
[3691.15s -> 3692.11s]  You got to chop right here.
[3692.11s -> 3692.67s]  Right here.
[3692.67s -> 3693.23s]  Right here.
[3693.23s -> 3693.95s]  Where I'm standing.
[3696.06s -> 3696.86s]  Quickly.
[3696.86s -> 3697.36s]  Guys.
[3697.82s -> 3699.18s]  No, we're good here.
[3699.18s -> 3699.68s]  Guys.
[3699.76s -> 3700.32s]  Up.
[3700.32s -> 3700.96s]  Chop up.
[3704.70s -> 3708.46s]  I think you're severely underestimating the severity of the situation.
[3708.46s -> 3708.94s]  Yes, he is.
[3708.94s -> 3711.18s]  He doesn't understand that we can't get the track over there.
[3713.01s -> 3713.89s]  You're crazy, dude.
[3716.18s -> 3717.06s]  God.
[3717.06s -> 3718.93s]  All right.
[3718.93s -> 3719.65s]  Are we good?
[3719.65s -> 3721.41s]  Any special things or just go?
[3722.45s -> 3725.73s]  There is a nugget in the top but there's no conceivable way to get that.
[3727.09s -> 3728.13s]  And the bucket's gone.
[3728.13s -> 3728.53s]  That's okay.
[3728.53s -> 3729.33s]  We made it.
[3729.33s -> 3730.21s]  Does it put itself out?
[3733.66s -> 3734.16s]  Yes.
[3735.17s -> 3736.13s]  We only have one bolt.
[3737.11s -> 3738.63s]  Can't even mine otherwise go.
[3739.27s -> 3747.30s]  Okay, so it needs to be like on constant vigilant bucket duty.
[3748.18s -> 3748.58s]  Yeah.
[3748.58s -> 3749.70s]  We could just buy the upgrade.
[3750.42s -> 3750.92s]  Yeah.
[3752.48s -> 3752.98s]  Yep.
[3753.60s -> 3758.92s]  We're gonna have a problem here in two seconds.
[3759.64s -> 3760.14s]  What's that?
[3761.08s -> 3764.52s]  Because it's a very straight narrow line and this just got way hard.
[3764.52s -> 3765.40s]  Go completely straight.
[3766.36s -> 3767.16s]  Just go straight.
[3767.16s -> 3768.12s]  Straight, straight, straight.
[3769.96s -> 3778.64s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[3778.64s -> 3779.84s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[3779.84s -> 3786.68s]  There's a stone.
[3788.80s -> 3789.60s]  Put stone in there.
[3790.56s -> 3791.52s]  Track, track, track, track.
[3791.52s -> 3793.28s]  No one is getting the stone.
[3794.32s -> 3794.80s]  I got it.
[3794.80s -> 3795.84s]  No one like we need.
[3799.36s -> 3800.16s]  I'm having stress.
[3802.08s -> 3802.58s]  Okay.
[3803.24s -> 3803.96s]  Bucket, bucket.
[3803.96s -> 3804.68s]  Don't leave the bucket.
[3804.68s -> 3807.00s]  This is really, really uh claustrophobic right now.
[3807.00s -> 3808.04s]  Don't leave this bucket back here.
[3808.84s -> 3809.34s]  What?
[3810.12s -> 3810.85s]  All right, we're good.
[3814.92s -> 3816.68s]  I'm just, I'm 100% digging.
[3817.64s -> 3818.14s]  Right here.
[3818.14s -> 3818.84s]  Oh, man, we are.
[3823.65s -> 3825.01s]  Do you see the tree to your left?
[3825.65s -> 3826.93s]  We're gonna run out of stone unless I go up.
[3826.93s -> 3829.89s]  Do you see the tree directly in front of the penguin that's spinning around?
[3829.89s -> 3830.61s]  Oh, guys.
[3830.61s -> 3831.57s]  Guys, it's over.
[3831.57s -> 3832.53s]  Guys, it's over.
[3832.53s -> 3833.01s]  It's not over.
[3833.01s -> 3833.81s]  It's not, it's not over.
[3834.53s -> 3834.93s]  Stone.
[3834.93s -> 3835.81s]  We need a lot of stone.
[3838.31s -> 3840.63s]  I had, there's a bridge to come up around the corner,
[3840.63s -> 3841.75s]  up top around the engine.
[3842.55s -> 3844.16s]  I got a lot of, uh, stone.
[3850.18s -> 3850.90s]  You're not finished.
[3856.47s -> 3857.51s]  Get the auto miner on.
[3858.15s -> 3860.29s]  I got, I got, I got, I got it.
[3860.29s -> 3864.29s]  I don't want to get stuck back here.
[3864.29s -> 3864.79s]  Fuck.
[3865.49s -> 3866.21s]  Oh, hold on.
[3866.21s -> 3866.71s]  There we go.
[3867.65s -> 3869.44s]  Okay, hold on.
[3870.40s -> 3874.04s]  Don't, we're gonna need this pickaxe up here soon.
[3874.84s -> 3875.64s]  I got it.
[3875.64s -> 3876.36s]  Where, what do you need it?
[3877.40s -> 3879.08s]  Oh, eventually we're going to need to start digging.
[3880.72s -> 3881.60s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[3882.82s -> 3883.46s]  That's too cool.
[3883.46s -> 3884.82s]  I, nobody, we can't all get in there.
[3886.18s -> 3888.37s]  I'm trying my best.
[3888.37s -> 3889.09s]  We're out of stone.
[3889.89s -> 3891.65s]  No, we're not, no, we're not, no, we're not, no, we're not, no, we're not.
[3891.65s -> 3893.01s]  I'm going straight, straight, straight.
[3893.65s -> 3894.85s]  Get this, get this one right here.
[3894.85s -> 3895.97s]  Come on, I'm standing right in front of it.
[3895.97s -> 3897.01s]  We need a lot of stone.
[3898.05s -> 3899.57s]  Whoever's got the pickaxe needs to go.
[3899.65s -> 3902.77s]  It's right next to, to the left, to the left, to the right, to the front.
[3904.20s -> 3906.68s]  All right, someone go feed it stone and get the track.
[3906.68s -> 3907.48s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[3908.68s -> 3915.08s]  I didn't do it.
[3915.08s -> 3919.20s]  All right, I'm making a path for you to come through.
[3920.71s -> 3921.35s]  Fuck it.
[3921.35s -> 3921.75s]  Fuck it.
[3921.75s -> 3922.55s]  Fuck it alert.
[3922.55s -> 3923.19s]  Fuck it alert.
[3923.19s -> 3923.75s]  Fuck it alert.
[3929.22s -> 3930.90s]  We're going to need a two by two path.
[3930.90s -> 3932.34s]  We're screwed in a second.
[3932.34s -> 3932.84s]  What do you mean?
[3934.08s -> 3936.24s]  This isn't, we're not going to be able to get to the back of the train.
[3937.20s -> 3938.08s]  Oh shit, hold on.
[3938.96s -> 3942.48s]  Where's it, uh, uh, yep.
[3943.44s -> 3944.24s]  No, we're fine, we're fine.
[3944.24s -> 3944.88s]  We're good.
[3944.88s -> 3945.44s]  We're relaxed.
[3946.32s -> 3948.98s]  I got a thousand stone on me.
[3950.50s -> 3957.20s]  I have made it two by two all the way to the station.
[3965.84s -> 3966.56s]  Oh no.
[3966.56s -> 3967.06s]  Fuck.
[3967.60s -> 3972.36s]  We're going to miss the, uh, we're going to miss the, uh, the bolt, the bolt, the bolt.
[3972.36s -> 3973.08s]  We can still get it.
[3974.20s -> 3975.00s]  You, I'll do this.
[3975.00s -> 3975.72s]  You guys focus on that.
[3975.72s -> 3976.60s]  I'll get this.
[3976.60s -> 3977.88s]  Where's the pickaxe?
[3977.88s -> 3978.68s]  I got it.
[3978.68s -> 3980.68s]  You, uh, you build the track.
[3980.68s -> 3981.00s]  Okay.
[3981.00s -> 3981.96s]  Go up and get that bolt.
[3981.96s -> 3982.60s]  I need it through.
[3983.72s -> 3984.44s]  I need it through.
[3985.64s -> 3986.60s]  I need through.
[3987.56s -> 3988.72s]  I don't.
[3988.72s -> 3988.96s]  Okay.
[3988.96s -> 3989.76s]  I got the last piece.
[3990.80s -> 3994.60s]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[3994.60s -> 3996.37s]  Hold it.
[3996.37s -> 3997.33s]  I'm only two away.
[4000.28s -> 4001.16s]  Oh yeah.
[4001.16s -> 4001.66s]  Yeah.
[4004.52s -> 4006.84s]  Don't leave me behind up in the mountains.
[4006.84s -> 4008.12s]  You'll be all right.
[4008.12s -> 4009.62s]  All right.
[4009.62s -> 4010.18s]  We got four.
[4012.84s -> 4013.72s]  Oh yeah.
[4016.45s -> 4016.77s]  All right.
[4016.77s -> 4018.77s]  I'm in favor of water capacity at 100%.
[4019.89s -> 4021.12s]  What's this new one?
[4022.24s -> 4023.12s]  Shows you the way.
[4024.00s -> 4026.08s]  Auto pick up things placed nearby.
[4026.96s -> 4029.60s]  I mean, I, I, I think auto pick up.
[4030.56s -> 4032.64s]  And water capacity.
[4037.41s -> 4037.97s]  Yeah.
[4037.97s -> 4039.09s]  I'm in favor.
[4039.09s -> 4040.29s]  Auto pick up is pretty huge.
[4041.99s -> 4042.87s]  This is a new thing.
[4043.51s -> 4043.67s]  Yeah.
[4043.67s -> 4045.43s]  I want to put it at the front
[4045.43s -> 4047.43s]  or should I put it after the auto miner?
[4047.43s -> 4048.39s]  Maybe put it at the end.
[4049.03s -> 4050.15s]  Yeah, right back.
[4050.15s -> 4051.59s]  Because then they would just get everything we missed.
[4054.60s -> 4055.56s]  Uh, no, put it in the front.
[4057.01s -> 4059.17s]  It's most likely we're going to be digging near the front.
[4059.97s -> 4066.52s]  You want water tank in front or?
[4066.52s -> 4067.96s]  Auto, auto mine in front.
[4067.96s -> 4069.16s]  Yeah, but I already fucked that up.
[4070.36s -> 4071.08s]  Put it in the front.
[4071.08s -> 4072.60s]  Auto pick up in front.
[4072.60s -> 4073.00s]  All right.
[4073.00s -> 4074.20s]  Auto pick up in front.
[4074.20s -> 4075.00s]  And then the capacity.
[4076.04s -> 4077.81s]  By the way, you can only have five pieces.
[4077.81s -> 4078.93s]  So be aware of that.
[4078.93s -> 4080.61s]  We've now cannot add anything else.
[4080.61s -> 4081.09s]  Crap.
[4081.09s -> 4081.41s]  Really?
[4081.97s -> 4083.01s]  Five out of five wagons.
[4087.75s -> 4089.03s]  Mine front, pick back.
[4089.67s -> 4091.35s]  Well, that's what I was thinking, but apparently not.
[4092.39s -> 4096.66s]  Uh, where's the tools?
[4097.22s -> 4097.86s]  Right in here.
[4098.66s -> 4100.34s]  It's all wood.
[4100.90s -> 4102.10s]  Yeah, it's all wood.
[4102.10s -> 4104.42s]  Uh, go backwards and start getting their stone on the ground.
[4105.78s -> 4108.74s]  I can't go up here.
[4108.74s -> 4110.34s]  How do you fuel the auto pickup?
[4110.98s -> 4112.18s]  Uh, auto pick up his wood.
[4113.36s -> 4114.16s]  I can't go back there.
[4114.16s -> 4115.44s]  Uh, auto mine it.
[4115.44s -> 4125.75s]  Where's the, uh, we're about to lose already.
[4126.63s -> 4127.43s]  We're good.
[4127.43s -> 4131.35s]  Just don't, uh, yeah, free him and bring the bucket.
[4133.65s -> 4134.45s]  Already nighttime.
[4135.73s -> 4137.97s]  We're dead.
[4137.97s -> 4138.93s]  We don't have any stone.
[4139.73s -> 4142.05s]  We have tracks in the back that no one picked up.
[4142.05s -> 4143.09s]  Oh, we're fine.
[4143.09s -> 4143.49s]  We're fine.
[4143.49s -> 4143.97s]  We're good.
[4143.97s -> 4146.31s]  Give him some swirls.
[4146.87s -> 4148.23s]  Well, if you give him some swirls, then we.
[4149.83s -> 4153.16s]  How do we get to the back now?
[4154.84s -> 4156.04s]  Uh, that's a you guys problem.
[4156.04s -> 4157.56s]  Oh, no, it's an us problem.
[4157.56s -> 4159.00s]  Just keep, just walk around.
[4159.72s -> 4160.92s]  It looked like it was abstract.
[4160.92s -> 4163.64s]  Track, track, track, track, track, track, track, track.
[4168.82s -> 4170.10s]  It's really dark and scary.
[4175.40s -> 4175.96s]  Great.
[4175.96s -> 4176.52s]  Two by two.
[4176.52s -> 4177.40s]  Should we go straight or up?
[4178.20s -> 4181.83s]  We have to go, uh, let's see what happens if we go up.
[4182.47s -> 4183.35s]  Yeah, we're going to buy two.
[4184.39s -> 4185.19s]  Two by two.
[4185.19s -> 4186.07s]  We need wood.
[4186.07s -> 4187.51s]  That's you need the two by two.
[4187.51s -> 4189.43s]  Jeremy, you need the two by two.
[4189.43s -> 4191.27s]  You need to turn around and free us.
[4192.07s -> 4192.87s]  Take right here.
[4197.16s -> 4197.64s]  Faster.
[4200.60s -> 4201.16s]  Got it.
[4202.12s -> 4203.32s]  Then bring stone immediately.
[4205.04s -> 4207.36s]  Bring stone immediately.
[4207.36s -> 4208.93s]  I mean, now what?
[4209.65s -> 4213.24s]  Uh, two by two.
[4213.24s -> 4214.20s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[4215.24s -> 4216.04s]  You're nudging me.
[4220.74s -> 4221.46s]  You're pushing me.
[4222.34s -> 4225.54s]  Are you going to file a lawsuit because I like flicked your ear?
[4225.54s -> 4226.04s]  What?
[4226.92s -> 4227.72s]  I'm coming with track.
[4230.01s -> 4231.61s]  Are we, we're going around?
[4231.61s -> 4235.83s]  I would, I just, I would just, I get, why are you doing that?
[4235.83s -> 4236.71s]  We don't have any trees.
[4238.07s -> 4238.79s]  Are there any trees up here?
[4238.79s -> 4239.59s]  Trees.
[4239.59s -> 4240.79s]  What do you need to this stuff?
[4240.79s -> 4241.43s]  Where am I?
[4241.43s -> 4242.71s]  Right here, right here, right here, right here.
[4242.71s -> 4243.43s]  You need something.
[4243.43s -> 4244.47s]  Someone come get the bucket.
[4245.43s -> 4246.07s]  Where's the bucket?
[4247.27s -> 4248.71s]  It's way back there, but we have to.
[4249.75s -> 4250.79s]  Thank God we can see.
[4250.79s -> 4251.11s]  All right.
[4253.26s -> 4255.18s]  We need, uh, we're going up.
[4255.18s -> 4256.46s]  I'm going to, uh, chopping wood.
[4257.10s -> 4257.74s]  We need wood.
[4258.30s -> 4259.02s]  The woods up here.
[4259.82s -> 4263.70s]  Wood by me.
[4267.27s -> 4268.31s]  I need this bucket moved.
[4272.09s -> 4273.21s]  You can just put it down, right?
[4273.77s -> 4275.21s]  No, I have to place the track.
[4276.09s -> 4280.84s]  Ooh, that's a tight squeeze.
[4280.84s -> 4282.36s]  That's, is that going to bump?
[4282.36s -> 4282.84s]  No.
[4282.84s -> 4289.96s]  Look at what the autominer is doing.
[4289.96s -> 4290.76s]  It's doing so well.
[4290.76s -> 4291.80s]  We need wood.
[4291.80s -> 4293.16s]  It's all up here, all up by me.
[4293.16s -> 4294.12s]  There's like a thousand of it.
[4295.51s -> 4296.39s]  I think this is it.
[4296.95s -> 4298.15s]  I think this is it.
[4298.15s -> 4298.71s]  This is not it.
[4300.42s -> 4300.98s]  This is it.
[4303.40s -> 4305.00s]  No, we only, we just, we lost the engine.
[4305.00s -> 4306.04s]  That's all right.
[4306.04s -> 4307.48s]  It's going faster now.
[4308.60s -> 4308.84s]  It is.
[4308.84s -> 4309.96s]  Just stand in front of it.
[4309.96s -> 4310.68s]  Stand in front of it.
[4311.56s -> 4313.56s]  All right.
[4313.56s -> 4314.60s]  We start from checkpoint.
[4320.63s -> 4321.75s]  That was hard.
[4321.75s -> 4322.47s]  That one was hard.
[4322.47s -> 4323.35s]  That was zigzags.
[4323.99s -> 4326.68s]  It was like someone said in all capitals,
[4326.68s -> 4328.52s]  this is what we get for wasting the autominer.
[4329.66s -> 4330.22s]  That's true.
[4330.86s -> 4331.26s]  It is.
[4332.30s -> 4334.22s]  We could have had autominer once,
[4335.42s -> 4336.86s]  auto collector right behind it.
[4337.50s -> 4338.54s]  Do we get to start a checkpoint?
[4338.54s -> 4339.90s]  And why are we stuck at connecting?
[4340.62s -> 4341.98s]  Yeah, I'm stuck at connecting too.
[4342.78s -> 4343.82s]  Star, are you like all tapped?
[4348.07s -> 4349.35s]  Reach, reach off from zero.
[4351.67s -> 4352.63s]  Was this not even the,
[4352.63s -> 4354.23s]  we didn't even finish the first biome?
[4355.11s -> 4355.91s]  No, we did not.
[4355.91s -> 4357.35s]  Save it at last checkpoint.
[4357.35s -> 4357.59s]  What?
[4359.16s -> 4360.76s]  We didn't even finish the first biome.
[4361.64s -> 4363.02s]  Okay.
[4363.02s -> 4365.02s]  Now it's like six hours past my bedtime.
[4365.82s -> 4367.98s]  I just had an insane deja vu right now.
[4370.25s -> 4371.05s]  This is the same map.
[4372.65s -> 4373.90s]  All right.
[4373.90s -> 4374.94s]  We'll clean it up.
[4374.94s -> 4375.90s]  This is the same seat.
[4375.90s -> 4377.18s]  So you want everything identical?
[4377.18s -> 4378.30s]  Do you want RNG fun?
[4378.30s -> 4379.66s]  Do RNG fun?
[4379.66s -> 4381.34s]  Well, that's why I left last time
[4381.34s -> 4382.46s]  and everyone yelled at me.
[4382.46s -> 4384.22s]  Well, I thought there was a different checkpoint.
[4386.82s -> 4387.14s]  All right.
[4387.14s -> 4387.94s]  RNG fun.
[4387.94s -> 4390.74s]  Guys, the train needs to be upgraded to save the game.
[4390.74s -> 4392.26s]  We need to do the four on the new.
[4392.26s -> 4393.46s]  That's how you get to a new area.
[4394.10s -> 4395.38s]  Oh, is it?
[4395.38s -> 4396.02s]  Uh-huh.
[4398.28s -> 4398.52s]  Yep.
[4399.24s -> 4404.46s]  Tied in the tutorial.
[4408.06s -> 4408.38s]  All right.
[4408.38s -> 4410.30s]  Well, what do you guys want to do?
[4410.30s -> 4411.18s]  You want to give it another go?
[4411.90s -> 4412.94s]  I want to eat dinner.
[4414.14s -> 4414.62s]  One more.
[4415.26s -> 4416.38s]  One more real attempt.
[4419.13s -> 4419.45s]  Right?
[4420.50s -> 4422.42s]  Look, hey, just order whatever you want.
[4422.42s -> 4424.10s]  Put it on my fucking cart.
[4424.10s -> 4425.30s]  I'm not ordering dinner.
[4425.30s -> 4426.58s]  That's irresponsible.
[4427.30s -> 4431.30s]  I want to do one more.
[4433.66s -> 4435.50s]  One more could be like three hours.
[4435.50s -> 4435.74s]  No.
[4435.74s -> 4436.46s]  If we get good.
[4437.50s -> 4437.74s]  Yeah.
[4438.38s -> 4439.86s]  They'd get good.
[4442.47s -> 4443.51s]  I don't want to walk over there too.
[4443.51s -> 4445.35s]  Because this is his opportunity to leave.
[4447.74s -> 4448.78s]  Are you always just playing?
[4448.78s -> 4450.62s]  We just did one more and you died in this tutorial.
[4453.32s -> 4453.96s]  You think we're really going to go three hours?
[4453.96s -> 4455.48s]  I don't want to redo the lobby.
[4457.00s -> 4457.64s]  That's what it is.
[4457.64s -> 4459.00s]  He doesn't want to do the lobby again.
[4459.00s -> 4459.88s]  Well, come over here.
[4459.88s -> 4460.12s]  Come on.
[4460.12s -> 4460.52s]  Come over.
[4460.52s -> 4461.00s]  Come on.
[4461.00s -> 4461.32s]  Let's go.
[4461.32s -> 4461.64s]  Let's go.
[4461.64s -> 4461.96s]  Let's go.
[4461.96s -> 4462.28s]  Let's hurry.
[4462.28s -> 4463.08s]  Let's fucking hurry.
[4464.04s -> 4467.16s]  He doesn't want to type the five-character code.
[4467.16s -> 4467.88s]  Just let him eat.
[4467.88s -> 4469.72s]  I'm saying just eat whatever you want.
[4470.68s -> 4472.76s]  Well, speaking of, the five-letter code is right there.
[4472.76s -> 4474.52s]  The five-letter code has been leaked.
[4474.52s -> 4477.98s]  So I hit BRB.
[4479.02s -> 4479.66s]  Sex.
[4479.66s -> 4480.06s]  Facts.
[4484.25s -> 4484.49s]  Go.
[4485.77s -> 4486.33s]  Does it matter?
[4486.33s -> 4487.13s]  Or do we not even care?
[4487.13s -> 4487.45s]  Go.
[4487.45s -> 4488.09s]  Go.
[4488.09s -> 4489.21s]  It's already leaked.
[4489.21s -> 4489.45s]  Go.
[4495.45s -> 4496.09s]  Sex fact.
[4499.88s -> 4502.68s]  This is the one.
[4503.64s -> 4504.28s]  All right.
[4504.28s -> 4506.76s]  We got some awkward initial stone.
[4518.07s -> 4518.71s]  Just once.
[4519.51s -> 4521.59s]  Two by two.
[4521.59s -> 4522.07s]  Two by two.
[4522.07s -> 4522.31s]  German.
[4522.31s -> 4522.71s]  Two by two.
[4522.71s -> 4523.11s]  Two by two.
[4523.11s -> 4523.35s]  German.
[4523.35s -> 4524.31s]  Two by two.
[4524.31s -> 4526.31s]  To be fair, you were not doing two by two.
[4528.79s -> 4531.69s]  Well, that's why I need someone to tell me.
[4535.61s -> 4536.73s]  No, I wasn't.
[4536.73s -> 4540.17s]  I was simply trying to do an impression of one of you two speaking.
[4542.25s -> 4547.99s]  Are we just going to go straight?
[4547.99s -> 4549.19s]  What are we doing here?
[4549.27s -> 4552.87s]  I think straight's probably because straight is more resources.
[4553.99s -> 4556.63s]  If you can't fit the things, just make a wood stack next to it.
[4562.09s -> 4564.89s]  Yeah, if we just go straight, the thing is over there.
[4568.14s -> 4570.70s]  Just don't forget about those enemies.
[4570.70s -> 4571.02s]  Wait.
[4571.02s -> 4571.74s]  No, we have to kill them.
[4572.97s -> 4575.13s]  Keep your commodities safe from bandits.
[4575.69s -> 4576.81s]  Yeah, they're stealing our stuff.
[4577.53s -> 4579.32s]  Just smash them.
[4580.28s -> 4583.80s]  Well, as we know, property is more valuable than human lives.
[4583.80s -> 4584.36s]  So kill them.
[4584.36s -> 4585.56s]  Okay, we need to dig straight.
[4598.36s -> 4599.08s]  Where's the bucket?
[4600.98s -> 4601.70s]  Where is the bucket?
[4601.70s -> 4602.50s]  Where's the bucket?
[4603.38s -> 4605.00s]  I haven't seen a bucket.
[4607.61s -> 4608.01s]  Where is the bucket?
[4608.01s -> 4608.57s]  Get there quick.
[4608.57s -> 4609.13s]  Get there quick.
[4609.13s -> 4609.69s]  Get there quick.
[4609.69s -> 4610.73s]  Just get there quick.
[4610.73s -> 4613.62s]  Straight line before it burns.
[4614.50s -> 4622.60s]  Two by two, German.
[4622.60s -> 4623.24s]  Two by two.
[4623.24s -> 4624.36s]  It doesn't matter.
[4624.36s -> 4625.00s]  We just have to go.
[4626.04s -> 4631.62s]  Let's not be doing it anymore.
[4632.34s -> 4636.18s]  Yeah, because as soon as you place down the last track, we got it.
[4636.18s -> 4637.22s]  Is that a dinosaur?
[4637.22s -> 4638.02s]  All right, we're done.
[4638.02s -> 4639.06s]  Where?
[4639.06s -> 4639.70s]  Yeah, place it.
[4643.18s -> 4644.86s]  There's a dinosaur where the pickaxe is.
[4647.05s -> 4648.33s]  There is a dinosaur.
[4648.33s -> 4649.77s]  Is that a new character?
[4649.77s -> 4651.53s]  No, someone joined because it was public.
[4652.41s -> 4653.61s]  Well, it is a new character then.
[4654.33s -> 4655.37s]  Wait, somebody's in the game?
[4656.09s -> 4657.37s]  Yeah, somebody's in the game.
[4659.54s -> 4660.18s]  Well, hey.
[4660.18s -> 4661.38s]  Lucky chat member.
[4661.38s -> 4662.82s]  Somebody got in.
[4665.78s -> 4667.22s]  Well, hey, a fourth person.
[4667.22s -> 4668.50s]  This just like helps.
[4668.50s -> 4669.70s]  Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[4670.74s -> 4671.86s]  There's no money to spend.
[4671.86s -> 4673.38s]  You guys just fucking dilly dally.
[4674.42s -> 4675.56s]  I got to eat dinner.
[4676.20s -> 4677.48s]  Hey, whatever.
[4677.48s -> 4679.64s]  This is just like a major league baseball mascot.
[4684.06s -> 4685.74s]  They're going to be like so helpful.
[4685.74s -> 4686.22s]  I know.
[4686.22s -> 4687.90s]  Well, we shouldn't even be upset about this.
[4689.74s -> 4691.26s]  Yeah, until he doesn't two by two.
[4692.38s -> 4693.26s]  He's not.
[4693.26s -> 4695.90s]  Do you think they get the dinosaur costume without two by twoing?
[4697.10s -> 4699.29s]  I think it's random.
[4699.29s -> 4701.29s]  I think you can just pick any costume.
[4702.09s -> 4706.50s]  Can't mind the stone.
[4708.02s -> 4708.98s]  Should we just go straight?
[4710.74s -> 4712.34s]  Well, let's go down.
[4713.30s -> 4716.04s]  Well, Dingo, the dinosaur wants us to go this way.
[4716.04s -> 4717.00s]  So that's where we're going.
[4719.50s -> 4721.50s]  Is that M doing this?
[4727.66s -> 4729.58s]  Which I believe this one.
[4731.80s -> 4736.98s]  Yeah, our Sims 3 entrance mascot is going to help us out here.
[4737.78s -> 4742.12s]  Not Sims 3, go across to Tycoon 3.
[4748.50s -> 4752.60s]  I could have fucking just called that guy in Germany
[4752.60s -> 4753.72s]  and got him to play with him.
[4755.70s -> 4756.18s]  Yeah, but then.
[4758.87s -> 4759.43s]  Then what?
[4760.15s -> 4764.39s]  Well, I don't want to say, but then you end up with Dev in call,
[4764.39s -> 4767.11s]  who is like, all right, and the other features we've got here,
[4767.11s -> 4769.27s]  there are 17 different characters.
[4769.27s -> 4770.07s]  You don't call him.
[4770.07s -> 4771.03s]  You guys haven't been paying attention.
[4771.03s -> 4772.07s]  He already got the bolt.
[4773.43s -> 4775.38s]  Look it.
[4775.38s -> 4776.58s]  I saw that.
[4776.58s -> 4777.14s]  Did you, though?
[4777.86s -> 4778.10s]  Yeah.
[4779.06s -> 4783.02s]  Stuck on this tree.
[4783.02s -> 4784.06s]  What if this is the Dev?
[4786.25s -> 4787.21s]  This is playing like a Dev.
[4787.21s -> 4790.25s]  Because he has like common sense is like he's too smart.
[4790.33s -> 4791.53s]  He's just chopping trees.
[4791.53s -> 4793.45s]  You know, it's, it's called keeping your head down.
[4794.49s -> 4801.00s]  We're going, we're going too slow.
[4803.26s -> 4806.06s]  The Mario level is not auto scrolling fast enough.
[4806.06s -> 4807.42s]  He wants to keep going faster.
[4808.70s -> 4817.35s]  Things aren't building quick enough.
[4817.35s -> 4820.71s]  Yes, because we have a slow ass train.
[4821.51s -> 4831.96s]  Stone, stone.
[4833.08s -> 4836.79s]  This person just took over.
[4836.79s -> 4838.39s]  He's just chopping like a maniac.
[4839.11s -> 4840.15s]  This so good.
[4840.15s -> 4842.63s]  Hey, Star, I hope you know that we probably will be here for three hours
[4842.63s -> 4844.79s]  because we have somebody that actually knows everything.
[4844.87s -> 4848.23s]  Well, now I can leave it down to the three players, which was efficient.
[4849.99s -> 4852.73s]  Let's keep dinosaur mascot.
[4854.25s -> 4858.60s]  That's so fun.
[4858.60s -> 4860.42s]  Yeah, we're doing too good.
[4863.34s -> 4864.38s]  We have a surplus.
[4865.58s -> 4867.42s]  There's like a thousand wood, my man.
[4867.42s -> 4869.18s]  What is that extra zig for?
[4869.18s -> 4869.98s]  Look at all this.
[4873.10s -> 4874.22s]  Wait, you want to go that way?
[4875.34s -> 4877.10s]  Oh, we have to go that way.
[4877.10s -> 4877.66s]  Oh shit.
[4878.62s -> 4879.02s]  Watch out.
[4879.74s -> 4885.37s]  We've got too many resources.
[4886.01s -> 4887.13s]  Does anyone want to take care of that?
[4888.09s -> 4888.59s]  Fire.
[4899.59s -> 4900.87s]  I love that dinosaur.
[4906.02s -> 4906.98s]  I love the animation.
[4906.98s -> 4907.94s]  The animation is the best.
[4907.94s -> 4909.78s]  He just leans back and forth with his head.
[4910.66s -> 4917.18s]  All right.
[4917.18s -> 4919.58s]  This is a pain in the ass level one.
[4919.58s -> 4922.70s]  By the way, we also have to address, we have to address another thing.
[4925.10s -> 4927.58s]  Didn't you have the game is unjoinable selected?
[4928.54s -> 4930.12s]  Well, it was no randoms.
[4930.12s -> 4931.24s]  They had the private code.
[4932.04s -> 4932.54s]  Oh.
[4933.64s -> 4935.96s]  There's like a random matchmaking as well.
[4937.08s -> 4940.54s]  Well, we got it.
[4940.54s -> 4943.88s]  We got a straightaway here for one second.
[4943.88s -> 4945.32s]  I heard the like, don't don't don't don't.
[4945.32s -> 4946.36s]  I thought that was the train.
[4946.36s -> 4947.24s]  You running up the track.
[4949.16s -> 4950.12s]  It is.
[4950.12s -> 4952.36s]  All right, stream viewer.
[4953.32s -> 4957.56s]  If you pick a single upgrade in there immediately, you're dead.
[4957.56s -> 4958.76s]  You're dead.
[4958.76s -> 4961.40s]  In fact, we probably just let him pick all the upgrades.
[4961.40s -> 4963.00s]  He probably knows the exact placement.
[4963.00s -> 4964.52s]  We should probably just give him our stream key.
[4971.48s -> 4972.28s]  Don't leave us behind.
[4972.92s -> 4974.23s]  All right.
[4974.23s -> 4975.11s]  We have four bolts.
[4976.63s -> 4985.85s]  He's like, do this one.
[4985.85s -> 4987.85s]  Auto pick up commodities.
[4987.85s -> 4988.33s]  Maybe this one.
[4988.33s -> 4989.93s]  I like auto pick up commodities.
[4990.81s -> 4991.53s]  This one, I'm good.
[4993.61s -> 4993.85s]  I love this.
[4993.85s -> 4996.65s]  We have so many that we need some stack size too.
[4996.65s -> 5000.73s]  Because we had so many commodities that just four of us.
[5001.94s -> 5004.10s]  Now, the thing is, do these stay or do they come back?
[5005.06s -> 5008.58s]  Oh, I think that's randomly rolling.
[5008.58s -> 5010.50s]  Because if it's random every time, then get it now.
[5011.54s -> 5012.07s]  Yeah.
[5012.07s -> 5012.71s]  Where do we put it?
[5013.69s -> 5019.70s]  If it stays there through the next one, then right in the front.
[5020.58s -> 5025.14s]  Yeah.
[5025.14s -> 5027.54s]  Put it right in the front and then we'll get the auto miner to go.
[5027.54s -> 5028.58s]  Obey the dyno.
[5030.82s -> 5034.10s]  Hey, I'm obeying the dyno.
[5034.10s -> 5039.45s]  So the new engine lets us save.
[5041.16s -> 5043.32s]  The new engine means we are at a new place.
[5043.64s -> 5044.84s]  Is that we can go.
[5044.84s -> 5050.28s]  That's the new biome, which means that allows us to restart from that biome.
[5051.64s -> 5053.91s]  Are we going down?
[5053.91s -> 5054.39s]  Who knows?
[5054.95s -> 5055.43s]  I don't know.
[5057.59s -> 5057.83s]  Sure.
[5059.59s -> 5062.15s]  Although this is going right into unmindable territory.
[5063.59s -> 5063.91s]  All right.
[5063.91s -> 5066.15s]  Can you chop to the right?
[5066.15s -> 5067.27s]  Or you have to make a bridge.
[5068.15s -> 5069.43s]  Bridge is necessary.
[5071.91s -> 5079.00s]  It's me dyno.
[5079.00s -> 5079.80s]  Please mod me.
[5081.24s -> 5095.35s]  We got stone up ahead.
[5097.35s -> 5098.39s]  Holy shit.
[5098.39s -> 5099.59s]  Look at all that track.
[5099.59s -> 5100.55s]  Where did that even come from?
[5103.24s -> 5104.28s]  We've just been doing it.
[5104.28s -> 5107.24s]  Is this just what happens when you add a fourth player who's also a dinosaur,
[5107.24s -> 5108.20s]  who's also a dev?
[5108.92s -> 5113.56s]  What's also like anybody is a warm body and this game doesn't change difficulty based on
[5113.56s -> 5114.44s]  how many people are in it.
[5117.08s -> 5117.40s]  Wow.
[5117.40s -> 5117.80s]  Funky.
[5119.24s -> 5123.05s]  So hungry.
[5124.33s -> 5126.01s]  Why don't you eat some of these rocks?
[5126.01s -> 5128.09s]  I haven't seen my wife in days.
[5129.21s -> 5130.34s]  Pete.
[5131.06s -> 5137.02s]  I'm so hungry.
[5137.02s -> 5139.26s]  So, well, I told you just get whatever you want.
[5140.22s -> 5141.50s]  What do you want?
[5141.50s -> 5141.90s]  Pizza?
[5142.54s -> 5144.22s]  I want to make my dinner.
[5144.22s -> 5144.94s]  What do you want?
[5144.94s -> 5145.34s]  Pizza?
[5146.94s -> 5147.82s]  What do you kids want today?
[5148.46s -> 5149.18s]  Order me a pizza.
[5158.14s -> 5163.78s]  Where's the wood?
[5163.78s -> 5168.14s]  Oh, where's the wood?
[5168.70s -> 5169.66s]  We need wood to make.
[5172.18s -> 5175.62s]  That's all I've been doing since we've loaded into this level.
[5175.62s -> 5176.42s]  You could do more.
[5183.30s -> 5184.34s]  Who's the dino?
[5184.34s -> 5184.90s]  We don't know.
[5184.90s -> 5186.02s]  It's a mystery dino.
[5186.66s -> 5187.78s]  Don't lose that pickaxe.
[5189.70s -> 5190.82s]  Don't lose that pickaxe.
[5192.26s -> 5196.30s]  I mean, you could.
[5202.79s -> 5204.15s]  I think we got enough to finish, right?
[5205.35s -> 5209.32s]  Well, that went very smoothly.
[5209.88s -> 5211.16s]  Did we see any secrets, though?
[5212.44s -> 5213.64s]  I think you just got it.
[5213.64s -> 5214.68s]  I think you just got the ball.
[5217.83s -> 5219.11s]  We need the little bridge.
[5220.15s -> 5222.10s]  Little bridge?
[5222.10s -> 5222.90s]  Up top?
[5222.90s -> 5224.10s]  The bridge needs to go up.
[5224.82s -> 5225.06s]  What?
[5226.52s -> 5228.12s]  How are we going to connect to this over the water?
[5228.12s -> 5229.16s]  We need a bridge over the water.
[5229.16s -> 5229.32s]  Right.
[5229.32s -> 5230.52s]  There's bamboo shoots.
[5230.52s -> 5231.00s]  Oh, fuck.
[5231.00s -> 5231.40s]  All right.
[5231.40s -> 5231.72s]  We're good.
[5231.72s -> 5231.96s]  We're good.
[5231.96s -> 5232.20s]  We're good.
[5233.00s -> 5233.56s]  Right here.
[5234.20s -> 5235.48s]  Look at this damn dino.
[5235.48s -> 5235.96s]  Look at that.
[5237.26s -> 5238.06s]  I'm just watching.
[5238.06s -> 5238.30s]  All right.
[5238.30s -> 5239.26s]  I'm going to have to do something.
[5239.26s -> 5241.26s]  Just there's wood right here.
[5241.26s -> 5241.82s]  Just do it.
[5249.51s -> 5249.91s]  I get it.
[5249.91s -> 5253.43s]  I'm going to say I really don't think it takes a developer to connect point A to point B.
[5255.19s -> 5256.55s]  That's not how this goes.
[5256.55s -> 5257.75s]  I chop wood.
[5258.55s -> 5259.35s]  That's not where this goes.
[5260.39s -> 5265.24s]  I'm going to mine a rock quick.
[5272.10s -> 5272.58s]  This one?
[5272.58s -> 5273.70s]  Autominer.
[5273.70s -> 5273.94s]  Me.
[5275.40s -> 5275.88s]  No me.
[5276.84s -> 5279.56s]  I'm just having fun watching the Dinosaur play.
[5280.28s -> 5282.07s]  What about this thing?
[5283.43s -> 5284.79s]  We can't have any more.
[5284.79s -> 5286.15s]  Converts wood to iron.
[5286.15s -> 5286.71s]  Oh, that's it.
[5286.71s -> 5286.95s]  Yeah.
[5287.59s -> 5287.99s]  No more.
[5287.99s -> 5288.31s]  That's it.
[5291.18s -> 5291.66s]  No more.
[5291.66s -> 5292.38s]  That's it.
[5292.38s -> 5292.86s]  No more.
[5292.86s -> 5293.18s]  That's it.
[5293.18s -> 5294.14s]  It's five out of five.
[5295.10s -> 5298.87s]  How am I not standing in the square?
[5298.87s -> 5299.51s]  I thought I was.
[5301.46s -> 5302.18s]  That guy stood in it.
[5302.18s -> 5303.06s]  He must have been a dev.
[5303.78s -> 5306.58s]  Okay.
[5307.46s -> 5309.27s]  You joke out.
[5309.27s -> 5310.15s]  Get your jokes out.
[5310.95s -> 5312.66s]  They're funny.
[5312.66s -> 5313.46s]  They're really funny.
[5314.10s -> 5316.10s]  Although they can sometimes be hurtful to me.
[5317.30s -> 5319.32s]  All right.
[5319.32s -> 5322.68s]  So autominer boy is on and auto collector is on at the same time.
[5323.48s -> 5324.76s]  That's pretty good.
[5324.76s -> 5325.64s]  Let's see what happened.
[5325.64s -> 5326.84s]  Are we just going straight or what?
[5327.80s -> 5330.55s]  I guess so.
[5330.55s -> 5331.75s]  Oh, there's a golden nugget.
[5332.31s -> 5332.71s]  Where is it?
[5335.59s -> 5345.42s]  I'm going to put this all the way over here because I know we're not.
[5345.42s -> 5346.86s]  No one's going to remember that's over there.
[5347.82s -> 5350.30s]  Uh, the auto collector really does chew through wood.
[5351.34s -> 5353.62s]  Uh, where's the X?
[5353.62s -> 5354.26s]  He's going to the X.
[5354.26s -> 5362.52s]  Oh, you do.
[5362.52s -> 5363.48s]  Yeah, we have to go down.
[5379.83s -> 5380.39s]  Cool.
[5380.39s -> 5382.01s]  How are we doing?
[5382.01s -> 5386.73s]  We're going to need a two by two pretty soon or the autominer to be powered or both.
[5386.73s -> 5388.01s]  I'm going to call the autominer right now.
[5389.13s -> 5391.66s]  Autominer is on.
[5392.22s -> 5396.42s]  I'm going to start.
[5396.42s -> 5397.38s]  We need some stone, right?
[5397.38s -> 5398.02s]  I'm stuck.
[5398.02s -> 5398.74s]  Are we stuck?
[5399.78s -> 5403.38s]  Oh, oh, alert, alert, alert, alert.
[5410.55s -> 5412.15s]  Now we need a miner down here.
[5412.15s -> 5413.43s]  What happened to the two by two?
[5413.99s -> 5415.27s]  I was screamed at.
[5415.27s -> 5415.59s]  I got it.
[5415.59s -> 5415.91s]  I got it.
[5415.91s -> 5416.23s]  I got it.
[5416.23s -> 5425.98s]  Man, get rid of these trees down here.
[5426.70s -> 5427.98s]  Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[5433.27s -> 5435.11s]  How far does the stack boy reach?
[5443.13s -> 5445.93s]  Oh, when you dash them, when they drop their tool, that's what's happening.
[5446.73s -> 5448.23s]  You need tools stolen.
[5449.27s -> 5457.26s]  All right, we need the, uh, we need the axe over here on the right with the cows.
[5458.14s -> 5464.78s]  Okay, you can move the cows away.
[5464.78s -> 5467.10s]  They're just kind of, you can pick them up.
[5467.10s -> 5468.62s]  This is causing a boy out of the way.
[5475.37s -> 5475.85s]  So far.
[5477.30s -> 5477.78s]  Pretty good.
[5478.50s -> 5481.06s]  Me and Dino just got to cross up.
[5481.06s -> 5481.54s]  Did you see that?
[5482.34s -> 5483.38s]  Anyone watching right now?
[5483.38s -> 5484.34s]  Put that in remind.
[5484.34s -> 5485.30s]  We just got crossed up.
[5485.30s -> 5485.94s]  That was crazy.
[5487.86s -> 5490.10s]  I thought he was, uh, me and he thought he was him.
[5491.53s -> 5492.49s]  I'm stuck.
[5492.49s -> 5506.42s]  Don't lose me.
[5506.42s -> 5508.26s]  We are down to the final piece.
[5508.26s -> 5509.46s]  Oh, we're stuck back here.
[5509.46s -> 5511.38s]  Alert, how do we do the, how do we do the alert button?
[5511.38s -> 5512.18s]  How do I do that?
[5512.18s -> 5512.98s]  I want to do that too.
[5513.70s -> 5514.18s]  Let's alert.
[5514.18s -> 5514.74s]  Great trigger.
[5516.02s -> 5519.61s]  I think I'll be able to save you.
[5521.13s -> 5522.97s]  Uh, yeah, we need to, we need to access.
[5527.48s -> 5528.52s]  Uh, also fire.
[5529.16s -> 5532.44s]  Also we are, did we get the key thing?
[5533.08s -> 5533.32s]  Yeah.
[5533.32s -> 5534.28s]  He's got the last thing.
[5534.28s -> 5534.44s]  Yeah.
[5535.32s -> 5539.56s]  Destroy no animals.
[5539.56s -> 5540.04s]  We got it.
[5541.90s -> 5544.30s]  Do we get, um, by the way.
[5544.30s -> 5545.58s]  Now we can only do upgrades.
[5545.58s -> 5548.06s]  So we should probably get the new engine eventually, right?
[5548.06s -> 5550.78s]  We really should do the quest thing that pops up.
[5550.78s -> 5553.02s]  Cause I think we just got two bolts for doing that.
[5554.14s -> 5555.18s]  What was the quest?
[5555.18s -> 5556.46s]  It was don't hit, kill any animals.
[5556.46s -> 5557.98s]  So don't do anything to animals.
[5558.06s -> 5559.18s]  We just got like a boat for that.
[5559.18s -> 5563.08s]  I think upgrade the auto-mining speed.
[5566.90s -> 5571.70s]  Oh, the engine lets you have more wagons.
[5572.26s -> 5574.82s]  Should we just wait?
[5579.58s -> 5579.90s]  Yeah.
[5582.81s -> 5583.21s]  Yeah.
[5583.21s -> 5584.89s]  That's all about that auto-miner life.
[5589.38s -> 5590.10s]  Key.
[5590.10s -> 5592.20s]  All right.
[5592.20s -> 5593.88s]  Pick roles, pick roles, pick roles here.
[5597.40s -> 5601.83s]  No, uh, we need stone or else we're dead.
[5601.83s -> 5603.51s]  Like we know.
[5611.91s -> 5613.35s]  There's a lot over here.
[5613.35s -> 5614.71s]  Well, do you want to put one down or?
[5614.71s -> 5615.27s]  No, I got it.
[5615.99s -> 5616.79s]  Auto-miner is on.
[5617.43s -> 5619.80s]  Which way are we going?
[5620.44s -> 5635.19s]  Don't lose these tracks with me.
[5637.10s -> 5637.90s]  I need more track.
[5638.78s -> 5639.34s]  It's right there.
[5640.55s -> 5642.87s]  Well, someone didn't finish mining that all the way.
[5642.87s -> 5644.07s]  So we might just lose.
[5644.87s -> 5645.59s]  Track is right here.
[5646.31s -> 5652.71s]  Don't leave that bucket.
[5653.75s -> 5654.39s]  Don't you do it.
[5654.39s -> 5655.59s]  I know you, you right there.
[5655.59s -> 5656.15s]  You're going to leave it.
[5656.15s -> 5656.71s]  I know you were.
[5657.35s -> 5658.02s]  All right.
[5658.02s -> 5659.06s]  We're about to get the ball all stuck.
[5659.06s -> 5660.02s]  We have a little tools up here, right?
[5661.06s -> 5663.82s]  Take your way over here.
[5664.62s -> 5667.90s]  Both of, uh, both of them all become stuck.
[5667.90s -> 5669.26s]  Thank God for the auto-miner.
[5670.14s -> 5680.26s]  Miner level two.
[5680.26s -> 5681.06s]  We're going up, right?
[5682.02s -> 5682.82s]  Are we going straight?
[5682.82s -> 5683.06s]  Yeah.
[5683.70s -> 5687.78s]  Uh, off or right?
[5687.78s -> 5688.18s]  Straight.
[5696.65s -> 5697.13s]  There you go.
[5699.02s -> 5701.50s]  Look at the auto-miner leveling the land.
[5701.50s -> 5702.30s]  Oh, it's crazy.
[5703.42s -> 5707.67s]  Stuck on this side.
[5708.79s -> 5711.90s]  All right.
[5711.90s -> 5714.30s]  What we got for, uh, that pickaxe.
[5716.54s -> 5718.63s]  That means there's a secret up top.
[5718.63s -> 5719.19s]  Oh shit.
[5719.19s -> 5719.59s]  Secret.
[5720.39s -> 5720.87s]  Probably.
[5727.83s -> 5729.59s]  We need wood to build a bridge up here.
[5740.06s -> 5741.42s]  Wood desperately needed up front.
[5742.06s -> 5749.10s]  Am I finishing it?
[5749.74s -> 5753.18s]  Uh, is there any, I think, I think we're about to go look for the bolt.
[5753.18s -> 5754.14s]  It might be a bolt up there.
[5754.14s -> 5754.94s]  Put these over here too.
[5754.94s -> 5757.18s]  So we get extra, uh, crack.
[5759.10s -> 5760.78s]  Is it up there?
[5760.78s -> 5761.18s]  Okay.
[5761.18s -> 5762.62s]  I think you just got to finish it.
[5762.62s -> 5762.86s]  Okay.
[5762.86s -> 5763.36s]  Okay.
[5764.38s -> 5764.78s]  I know.
[5764.78s -> 5769.48s]  Already got bolt about the secret.
[5770.28s -> 5771.80s]  Dude, we're going to be good to go next time.
[5771.80s -> 5772.12s]  Look at that.
[5772.12s -> 5773.24s]  It's dark out.
[5773.24s -> 5774.28s]  Should we just get the new engine?
[5776.66s -> 5776.98s]  Yeah.
[5777.94s -> 5778.66s]  New engine?
[5778.66s -> 5780.82s]  Or I mean, we have so many materials.
[5780.82s -> 5785.70s]  We just don't have big enough stack sizes or just get auto-miner.
[5785.70s -> 5787.22s]  We have materials everywhere.
[5787.22s -> 5791.78s]  I don't know if auto-mining better is going to help as much as stacking bigger.
[5792.74s -> 5793.94s]  Auto-mine.
[5794.90s -> 5795.46s]  Let's do it.
[5795.46s -> 5795.78s]  All right.
[5795.78s -> 5798.42s]  Auto-miner and the upgrade of that thing.
[5798.42s -> 5801.30s]  And then we'll do the, yeah.
[5802.74s -> 5802.90s]  Yeah.
[5802.90s -> 5804.10s]  Then we'll do the train next round.
[5804.74s -> 5807.70s]  Did you just get two auto-miner upgrades?
[5807.70s -> 5809.22s]  We got auto-miner and auto-picker.
[5809.22s -> 5810.18s]  Auto-pickup and auto-miner.
[5812.01s -> 5812.57s]  Yeah.
[5812.57s -> 5814.33s]  This thing's going to just chew.
[5814.33s -> 5816.89s]  We got like level one hold resources.
[5817.93s -> 5819.29s]  It'll just chew through everything.
[5819.29s -> 5823.27s]  We just need, we just got to survive.
[5823.27s -> 5824.23s]  Look at all this track we have.
[5824.23s -> 5824.71s]  Are you kidding me?
[5824.71s -> 5826.47s]  This is like, we are, we just started on easy mode.
[5828.41s -> 5832.01s]  Because apparently if you take the track off before it ends, it doesn't disappear.
[5833.21s -> 5843.27s]  Make sure you keep it.
[5843.27s -> 5844.55s]  Don't leave anything.
[5845.69s -> 5846.01s]  All right.
[5846.01s -> 5846.65s]  Where are we off to?
[5847.85s -> 5851.61s]  The problem is auto-miner can reach like twice as far as auto-picker.
[5853.24s -> 5854.04s]  That's better.
[5854.04s -> 5854.60s]  Holy shit.
[5854.60s -> 5855.80s]  It is destroying everything.
[5856.44s -> 5859.96s]  So if you upgrade them at the same time, you're not getting max value out of both.
[5861.32s -> 5865.80s]  Well, those cows.
[5865.80s -> 5866.92s]  There are cows in here, right?
[5867.88s -> 5872.44s]  Straight across.
[5874.01s -> 5875.29s]  I think straight is the way to go.
[5877.53s -> 5878.33s]  Hope so.
[5878.33s -> 5878.49s]  Yeah.
[5878.49s -> 5880.25s]  He's, he's going up the bolt.
[5880.25s -> 5880.65s]  Oops.
[5880.65s -> 5881.37s]  He's doing bolt.
[5882.41s -> 5883.82s]  He can't get those materials.
[5884.78s -> 5887.94s]  I mean, this is, this is easier.
[5889.46s -> 5893.88s]  Just make sure we get tracks placed down ahead of time because we're about to be.
[5894.68s -> 5894.92s]  Okay.
[5894.92s -> 5897.40s]  We need a wood.
[5897.40s -> 5899.80s]  This, this station's right here though.
[5899.80s -> 5900.60s]  What?
[5900.60s -> 5902.36s]  Hey, Dino's not available.
[5903.48s -> 5905.16s]  Dino's taking us the wrong way.
[5905.16s -> 5906.36s]  Actually right now.
[5906.36s -> 5907.72s]  I mean, why did you listen to the stir maker?
[5909.00s -> 5910.36s]  Wait, I thought we were going to the right.
[5911.32s -> 5911.80s]  We were.
[5911.80s -> 5913.24s]  Dino moved all the train tracks.
[5913.24s -> 5913.56s]  It's all right.
[5913.56s -> 5914.04s]  It's okay.
[5914.04s -> 5915.32s]  We, we, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5915.32s -> 5915.72s]  This is safe.
[5915.72s -> 5916.12s]  This is fine.
[5916.12s -> 5916.92s]  This is fine.
[5916.92s -> 5917.24s]  Okay.
[5917.24s -> 5918.36s]  I'm on to you.
[5918.36s -> 5919.08s]  I'm on to you.
[5919.08s -> 5921.24s]  Tracks, tracks, tracks, tracks.
[5921.24s -> 5922.44s]  You need tracks.
[5922.44s -> 5923.56s]  Tracks, track, track it up.
[5925.61s -> 5926.73s]  We can connect it down here.
[5927.53s -> 5928.55s]  Everybody slow down.
[5928.55s -> 5928.95s]  We're fine.
[5929.91s -> 5934.82s]  Ay, ya, ya, ya.
[5934.82s -> 5935.54s]  Don't touch a cow.
[5936.26s -> 5939.34s]  Ay, ya, ya.
[5940.22s -> 5943.54s]  Dream.
[5943.54s -> 5944.58s]  I just want to eat dinner.
[5945.38s -> 5948.02s]  And then we take it down.
[5948.90s -> 5951.77s]  So down.
[5951.77s -> 5953.21s]  And then I'm going to start clearing the path here.
[5954.17s -> 5963.08s]  Yeah, we're good.
[5963.08s -> 5966.60s]  But there was, there was some panic there for absolutely no reason.
[5967.32s -> 5967.64s]  Yeah.
[5967.64s -> 5969.16s]  Absolutely none.
[5969.16s -> 5970.12s]  I mean, there was a reason.
[5971.08s -> 5971.48s]  Water.
[5971.48s -> 5972.04s]  For the water.
[5972.68s -> 5973.08s]  Water.
[5973.88s -> 5974.60s]  Was water.
[5975.56s -> 5983.72s]  You got to get two by two.
[5983.72s -> 5985.24s]  There's so much stone.
[5986.20s -> 5987.96s]  The whole mountain's level.
[5990.18s -> 5990.42s]  Yeah.
[5990.42s -> 5992.98s]  I think we could do next engine now.
[5994.26s -> 5998.22s]  We have so many resources.
[5998.22s -> 5999.82s]  We're just like throwing them in the ocean.
[5999.82s -> 6001.90s]  Well, we need like, we need the track builder because
[6003.10s -> 6004.86s]  barely keeping up with the train at this point.
[6007.26s -> 6008.78s]  Yeah, we do need the track builder.
[6008.78s -> 6009.50s]  Look at all this.
[6009.50s -> 6011.26s]  We need the track builder for the storage.
[6015.50s -> 6016.22s]  No bolts, right?
[6017.02s -> 6018.81s]  It's already been gobbled up.
[6018.81s -> 6019.21s]  Let's go.
[6020.17s -> 6029.30s]  Track 200 meters.
[6030.18s -> 6030.66s]  We get it.
[6031.38s -> 6034.76s]  Is there, I think, yeah, we don't.
[6034.76s -> 6035.24s]  Three bolts.
[6035.88s -> 6038.57s]  We just have to wait till next round.
[6038.57s -> 6038.81s]  Yeah.
[6038.81s -> 6039.69s]  Just by autominer.
[6040.33s -> 6044.41s]  Let's get the, we've been crafting speed on the planks.
[6044.41s -> 6044.89s]  That's fine.
[6044.89s -> 6045.85s]  We do it anyway.
[6046.65s -> 6047.37s]  What'd you just replace?
[6048.50s -> 6051.14s]  I upgraded the crafting speed of the tracks.
[6052.63s -> 6053.67s]  Dino said no.
[6054.47s -> 6055.91s]  We just went against Dino's wishes.
[6056.55s -> 6057.43s]  Fuck that guy.
[6057.43s -> 6057.99s]  I voted.
[6059.03s -> 6060.15s]  I voted in favor.
[6061.03s -> 6069.72s]  I know why you just said that.
[6069.72s -> 6074.79s]  Because this guy is keeping you from eating dinner because it means we're continuing.
[6075.83s -> 6076.58s]  Nice.
[6076.58s -> 6077.06s]  I understand.
[6077.70s -> 6079.70s]  Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.
[6080.82s -> 6082.33s]  All right.
[6082.33s -> 6084.33s]  We need a lot of stone.
[6084.33s -> 6084.57s]  All right.
[6084.57s -> 6085.05s]  We need to go.
[6085.77s -> 6086.09s]  All right.
[6086.09s -> 6087.29s]  We need to move now.
[6087.29s -> 6088.33s]  Like now, now, now, now.
[6091.38s -> 6092.18s]  Get the pickaxe.
[6098.50s -> 6098.90s]  No, me.
[6100.02s -> 6101.46s]  We might need to loop the track a bit.
[6102.18s -> 6103.06s]  Now we should be good.
[6103.06s -> 6103.86s]  We have a ton of track.
[6104.58s -> 6104.82s]  All right.
[6104.82s -> 6105.70s]  I'm just on stone, dude.
[6106.74s -> 6119.48s]  Like stuck over here.
[6120.52s -> 6121.80s]  We have a lot of plenty of track.
[6121.80s -> 6122.52s]  Oh, monsters.
[6123.64s -> 6126.65s]  Are we staying straight?
[6126.65s -> 6127.69s]  Just straight on?
[6127.69s -> 6128.49s]  No reason not to.
[6129.05s -> 6129.93s]  Somebody can get that.
[6129.93s -> 6130.49s]  Are we going up?
[6131.53s -> 6132.41s]  We're going up.
[6132.41s -> 6132.97s]  Going up.
[6133.53s -> 6134.25s]  Okay.
[6134.25s -> 6136.33s]  Only one player is allowed to pick up the bucket.
[6137.72s -> 6138.68s]  Where's the fire?
[6138.68s -> 6139.32s]  Where's the bucket?
[6139.32s -> 6140.12s]  Water bucket.
[6140.12s -> 6140.52s]  You got it?
[6141.32s -> 6142.12s]  Dino has it.
[6143.82s -> 6144.62s]  There's still stone here.
[6144.62s -> 6145.26s]  I can't get through.
[6145.82s -> 6147.26s]  Auto Miner will save you eventually.
[6148.14s -> 6154.28s]  Oh, yeah.
[6154.28s -> 6155.08s]  Should we have to go up?
[6155.64s -> 6158.50s]  I'm just looping it so we have some time.
[6159.22s -> 6165.93s]  Gonna shoot through everything.
[6167.13s -> 6169.11s]  We need to go up.
[6170.15s -> 6170.79s]  Actually, we're fine.
[6170.79s -> 6171.19s]  What do you see?
[6172.70s -> 6173.18s]  We're going.
[6174.79s -> 6176.23s]  You have to start to go up from here.
[6177.27s -> 6180.30s]  And then we need to build up the bridge.
[6184.71s -> 6185.43s]  What are we doing?
[6186.71s -> 6187.27s]  What are we doing?
[6187.27s -> 6188.07s]  It placed weird.
[6188.07s -> 6189.19s]  I did not mean to do that.
[6191.72s -> 6192.84s]  It buys us some time.
[6193.64s -> 6194.68s]  Well, kill.
[6200.44s -> 6200.76s]  Fire?
[6207.18s -> 6209.18s]  There really is just too much stuff on the ground.
[6209.74s -> 6210.22s]  Yes.
[6210.22s -> 6211.50s]  There's so many resources.
[6212.22s -> 6213.50s]  I'm sure that would be...
[6213.50s -> 6218.62s]  I'm sure that would be a very much not an issue in about five minutes.
[6222.46s -> 6224.46s]  Too much wood stacked right there.
[6224.46s -> 6225.74s]  You need to pick up that stack of wood.
[6227.34s -> 6228.70s]  Big fat stack of wood.
[6228.70s -> 6229.02s]  Thank you.
[6230.30s -> 6232.47s]  There's so many resources.
[6233.43s -> 6239.26s]  We just build our bridges twice as wide just because we can.
[6241.96s -> 6243.96s]  This is the power of human wealth and influence.
[6244.84s -> 6245.88s]  Yeah, this is just...
[6246.44s -> 6248.60s]  We've grown too fat and too greedy.
[6254.23s -> 6255.67s]  GG, auto, miner.
[6255.67s -> 6256.39s]  That's true.
[6256.39s -> 6257.27s]  I mean, we're pretty...
[6258.31s -> 6258.71s]  We still...
[6258.71s -> 6259.67s]  We don't even have enough...
[6259.67s -> 6260.39s]  We can't even do...
[6260.95s -> 6261.83s]  This is on fire.
[6262.55s -> 6262.95s]  Fuck it.
[6263.83s -> 6264.87s]  End it, end it, end it, end it.
[6264.87s -> 6265.35s]  It's on fire.
[6265.99s -> 6266.79s]  No, it's not.
[6266.79s -> 6267.43s]  It's good.
[6267.43s -> 6272.86s]  End it, end it, end it, end it, end it.
[6272.86s -> 6275.10s]  Oh, we need to get another track up there?
[6275.10s -> 6275.66s]  Oh, shit.
[6276.54s -> 6278.98s]  We don't have enough to do anything.
[6282.34s -> 6283.62s]  But you are doing something.
[6284.26s -> 6284.90s]  We have three.
[6284.90s -> 6285.54s]  Exactly.
[6285.54s -> 6286.50s]  It's fun.
[6286.50s -> 6287.38s]  They are, yeah.
[6287.38s -> 6289.86s]  You're stopping me from sleeping and eating.
[6290.58s -> 6291.38s]  Right now, Dino's like,
[6291.38s -> 6293.46s]  we could have had the engine if you wanted to save.
[6294.02s -> 6295.30s]  Train speed is critical.
[6296.18s -> 6297.13s]  What does that mean?
[6297.85s -> 6300.20s]  Produces dynamite.
[6300.92s -> 6303.00s]  Yeah, just wait until next train.
[6303.00s -> 6303.88s]  I know, I'm just reading.
[6304.52s -> 6310.63s]  I just wanted to see what they were.
[6310.63s -> 6310.95s]  Okay.
[6311.83s -> 6315.51s]  To try hard.
[6316.71s -> 6320.22s]  Get everything ready.
[6320.22s -> 6320.72s]  Great.
[6321.82s -> 6324.76s]  Our bridges have too much stone and no wood.
[6326.20s -> 6330.17s]  Yeah, that's actually happening right now.
[6331.82s -> 6332.94s]  Auto picker could use wood.
[6335.98s -> 6337.26s]  We could use wood.
[6338.22s -> 6340.06s]  Bring up.
[6340.06s -> 6341.82s]  We're going to get stuck.
[6341.82s -> 6342.32s]  We're stuck.
[6343.02s -> 6343.80s]  It's okay.
[6343.80s -> 6346.28s]  Auto miner is going to free it up.
[6349.67s -> 6351.03s]  We don't have any wood.
[6351.03s -> 6352.15s]  Who has the axe?
[6352.15s -> 6353.11s]  Who's got the axe?
[6353.11s -> 6355.27s]  I'm using the axe up here on the only trees.
[6356.23s -> 6360.43s]  Uh-oh.
[6361.13s -> 6363.10s]  This is where it gets bad.
[6364.97s -> 6366.41s]  Literally no trees.
[6367.69s -> 6368.57s]  Just bring the wood back.
[6369.45s -> 6371.61s]  There's so much stone all over the ground.
[6371.61s -> 6372.81s]  I'm like accidentally picking it up.
[6374.01s -> 6381.98s]  Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move.
[6381.98s -> 6383.74s]  Dark, dark, dark, dark.
[6383.74s -> 6384.46s]  Oh my God.
[6385.93s -> 6386.65s]  Oh, what are you doing?
[6386.65s -> 6389.69s]  Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark.
[6389.69s -> 6393.37s]  It's actually easier to see now than when there's fog.
[6394.49s -> 6396.63s]  We don't even need the axe right now.
[6399.54s -> 6400.50s]  Where's our bucket?
[6401.06s -> 6401.56s]  I got it.
[6403.67s -> 6405.43s]  I'm keeping one eye on that bucket.
[6405.43s -> 6406.07s]  Don't you worry.
[6406.87s -> 6416.04s]  Kill those bandits.
[6418.41s -> 6418.91s]  Fire.
[6419.87s -> 6425.66s]  All right.
[6425.66s -> 6426.68s]  I'm going to mine the stone over here.
[6437.50s -> 6438.70s]  We need a bolt though.
[6438.70s -> 6442.46s]  We still have three bolts.
[6442.46s -> 6443.74s]  Do we get them quickly on the level?
[6445.34s -> 6446.62s]  Yeah, you get one when you win.
[6446.62s -> 6448.38s]  All right, well, let's just can it.
[6448.38s -> 6448.88s]  Let's kill it.
[6453.00s -> 6454.04s]  Alex, grab bucket.
[6454.04s -> 6454.54s]  Branding two.
[6455.40s -> 6456.12s]  Grab what?
[6456.12s -> 6456.62s]  Bucket.
[6460.36s -> 6466.25s]  Okay, refilling it.
[6466.81s -> 6468.33s]  All right, let's take the opportunity to
[6468.81s -> 6470.89s]  stack up a bunch of shit so we don't lose it.
[6472.09s -> 6474.99s]  Let's have like a mile of track ready to go.
[6482.04s -> 6485.74s]  I want to be strong.
[6490.83s -> 6491.55s]  All right, right.
[6492.51s -> 6494.91s]  Yeah, the snow piercer video game.
[6494.91s -> 6497.23s]  It's time for us to get a new train engine.
[6498.99s -> 6500.27s]  Hi, hi, hi, dude.
[6500.27s -> 6502.35s]  I hope that train engine goes even slower.
[6503.47s -> 6504.91s]  It's probably going to be like twice as fast.
[6504.91s -> 6505.87s]  Train speed.
[6505.87s -> 6507.15s]  It resets the speed.
[6507.95s -> 6510.03s]  That wasn't really clear until now.
[6510.03s -> 6512.75s]  So the train just starts going faster until you upgrade the engine.
[6512.75s -> 6513.87s]  That doesn't really make sense.
[6517.82s -> 6519.74s]  Train speed is at 0.185.
[6519.74s -> 6520.38s]  New biome.
[6522.11s -> 6522.99s]  To Bob-omb.
[6528.27s -> 6529.79s]  There's two bolts above us.
[6529.79s -> 6530.83s]  I'm going to dig up that way.
[6531.63s -> 6537.37s]  We should take the train up.
[6537.37s -> 6539.69s]  Move those tracks so we can go up and get the bolts.
[6540.49s -> 6541.37s]  Uh, it's too late.
[6542.25s -> 6545.26s]  That's too late.
[6545.26s -> 6545.76s]  That's too late.
[6552.49s -> 6553.93s]  We need the wood tonight.
[6554.81s -> 6561.69s]  New biome.
[6561.69s -> 6563.13s]  This is tropical.
[6565.24s -> 6566.44s]  I think this is tundra.
[6567.24s -> 6572.04s]  All right, everyone grab a stack of track and we need to start moving it forward.
[6573.08s -> 6574.04s]  Too much track.
[6574.84s -> 6575.72s]  Too much track.
[6577.08s -> 6580.80s]  Those bolts, though.
[6580.80s -> 6582.32s]  Those bolts look so scrumptious.
[6582.96s -> 6584.48s]  Also, we need to mine up here.
[6585.92s -> 6586.86s]  I got it.
[6586.86s -> 6587.36s]  I'll take it.
[6588.22s -> 6590.60s]  I know it's on the bolts.
[6590.60s -> 6591.00s]  Don't worry.
[6601.21s -> 6605.71s]  We need the wood chopping up here.
[6606.51s -> 6608.25s]  Can I get one more right here?
[6608.97s -> 6611.68s]  Actually, yeah, that's fine.
[6612.32s -> 6620.94s]  The bolts, did he get them?
[6622.94s -> 6624.06s]  Hey, it's me.
[6624.06s -> 6625.26s]  I'm the mobile point.
[6626.48s -> 6626.98s]  Oh.
[6628.83s -> 6629.71s]  And there's the save point.
[6629.71s -> 6630.21s]  Look at that.
[6631.23s -> 6635.88s]  I have a small problem where if you do not be on the left side of the train,
[6638.92s -> 6639.96s]  you're going to get stuck.
[6640.76s -> 6645.48s]  There's so many tracks.
[6646.36s -> 6654.86s]  Does the auto miner have, uh,
[6655.90s -> 6659.23s]  We don't need any more, uh, resources.
[6666.32s -> 6666.82s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6666.82s -> 6668.00s]  This is the cactus station?
[6668.00s -> 6670.76s]  This has got to be the new biome.
[6670.76s -> 6671.26s]  Yeah.
[6671.98s -> 6673.50s]  It has a save above its head.
[6674.94s -> 6675.94s]  We're good.
[6676.80s -> 6679.41s]  Take everything you can.
[6680.45s -> 6686.22s]  Well, locked open here, so.
[6687.42s -> 6689.18s]  Man, we're not even yelling at each other anymore.
[6689.98s -> 6690.70s]  What are you doing?
[6690.70s -> 6691.34s]  What are you stupid?
[6691.34s -> 6692.06s]  What an idiot.
[6694.82s -> 6695.86s]  We should probably get storage.
[6696.82s -> 6699.22s]  Yeah, we need one of these storage.
[6700.72s -> 6702.96s]  What was the comment from before?
[6702.96s -> 6704.88s]  It's like, oh, they know what they're doing now.
[6704.88s -> 6706.40s]  Resident sleeper.
[6706.40s -> 6708.88s]  What it shows you the way and why is it only one?
[6709.84s -> 6717.68s]  Okay.
[6717.98s -> 6721.47s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[6721.47s -> 6721.97s]  Just.
[6723.66s -> 6724.70s]  I am the one.
[6726.59s -> 6727.39s]  Where are we going with this?
[6727.39s -> 6728.91s]  Oh, we have to go down there because of the.
[6729.47s -> 6730.35s]  I'm just don't.
[6730.35s -> 6731.07s]  This is not, don't.
[6731.07s -> 6732.43s]  It's not my, this is not my thing.
[6732.99s -> 6733.87s]  This is not my bag.
[6733.87s -> 6734.35s]  You know what I mean?
[6736.50s -> 6737.00s]  What?
[6753.30s -> 6755.30s]  We had a little extra track there for no reason.
[6756.10s -> 6757.22s]  I actually was doing it right.
[6757.94s -> 6758.90s]  I need to be more assertive.
[6758.90s -> 6760.98s]  We've got a lot of extra tracks, so.
[6760.98s -> 6761.86s]  Should be more assertive.
[6763.22s -> 6769.76s]  This is going to be a little weird over here.
[6769.76s -> 6771.60s]  Is the auto miner really not mining this?
[6772.96s -> 6774.32s]  Just do it faster.
[6778.16s -> 6779.68s]  Auto miner like kind of sucks.
[6780.88s -> 6783.71s]  Don't forget the water.
[6789.70s -> 6790.42s]  Wherever it is.
[6791.46s -> 6797.66s]  There is a top left.
[6798.30s -> 6801.44s]  Hey, I almost got the achievement engineer.
[6802.08s -> 6805.52s]  I've hit, I've destroyed 701 blocks out of 10,000.
[6806.64s -> 6809.36s]  So good at this game.
[6810.16s -> 6815.55s]  Don't leave that water bucket up there.
[6816.43s -> 6818.24s]  I was almost going to eat dinner,
[6818.24s -> 6821.20s]  but then it was literally the endless game mode.
[6824.13s -> 6826.29s]  Just one more endless mode.
[6827.89s -> 6839.01s]  Hey, can you come back and mine above it?
[6840.61s -> 6852.40s]  We're doing so good, guys.
[6852.40s -> 6853.28s]  We're doing so good.
[6854.40s -> 6856.72s]  Yeah, we're doing great in the endless mode.
[6865.82s -> 6867.18s]  All right, what do we need, what do you need me to do?
[6867.18s -> 6867.82s]  What do you need me to do?
[6867.82s -> 6868.46s]  Track is up.
[6868.46s -> 6869.34s]  Wood bridge.
[6869.34s -> 6871.98s]  Or we can just go around, but a wood bridge is just easier.
[6873.26s -> 6875.10s]  We need a wood cutter.
[6875.90s -> 6877.18s]  I will handle that.
[6877.18s -> 6877.98s]  I'll handle that.
[6878.70s -> 6888.51s]  Who's the founder of my bucket?
[6888.51s -> 6889.79s]  Is it just me or is this endless?
[6891.15s -> 6893.55s]  Yes, that is what you signed up for.
[6894.19s -> 6895.23s]  Can you stop bumping?
[6896.51s -> 6898.43s]  It totally knocks my stuff off.
[6898.43s -> 6902.11s]  I did offer you to order you and all your friends a pizza.
[6902.75s -> 6903.71s]  Order me a pizza.
[6904.67s -> 6907.26s]  What kind of pizza do you want?
[6907.26s -> 6909.84s]  Uh, me a pizza?
[6910.56s -> 6913.68s]  I have a pizza.
[6917.78s -> 6919.62s]  We have one tree up here that needs to be chopped.
[6920.58s -> 6924.48s]  And he's very close to getting the golden ticket.
[6925.12s -> 6926.32s]  We've got plenty of time.
[6926.32s -> 6928.16s]  We need to chop these cacodice.
[6928.96s -> 6929.52s]  We've got time.
[6930.48s -> 6936.03s]  All right, I will get it.
[6936.03s -> 6936.99s]  Who's got the axe?
[6938.21s -> 6939.89s]  Uh, Dino has axe?
[6939.89s -> 6941.01s]  No, Penguin has axe.
[6941.89s -> 6942.69s]  He did.
[6942.69s -> 6944.05s]  He just dropped it.
[6944.69s -> 6952.11s]  Bring it on.
[6952.11s -> 6956.13s]  All right, stack all the track and put out the fire.
[6958.98s -> 6960.37s]  Where's the bucket?
[6961.65s -> 6962.85s]  Who has the bucket?
[6962.85s -> 6963.33s]  You do.
[6963.97s -> 6964.45s]  Just end it.
[6966.69s -> 6967.09s]  Damn it.
[6967.98s -> 6970.30s]  Oh, it's not going to explode.
[6970.30s -> 6971.34s]  He has to stay.
[6973.34s -> 6974.94s]  All right, get a pizza.
[6975.66s -> 6979.89s]  Put it on the German 985 tab.
[6979.89s -> 6981.65s]  I don't want a pizza, Germa.
[6981.65s -> 6985.01s]  Order a sandwich from SubSandwich.
[6985.73s -> 6988.85s]  Germa, I'm on the road to commander.
[6989.73s -> 6990.54s]  What does that mean?
[6991.76s -> 6994.40s]  You know, you don't know what the road to commander is.
[6995.36s -> 6997.76s]  Wait, what about the ghost?
[6998.72s -> 7001.04s]  We're getting stack grabber level three.
[7002.24s -> 7005.38s]  It has extra range and plus one stack size.
[7006.42s -> 7012.83s]  SubSandwich TM.
[7015.12s -> 7015.92s]  Don't worry, Star.
[7015.92s -> 7017.52s]  It looks like it's getting hard for us.
[7017.52s -> 7020.00s]  And as you know, we're not very good.
[7020.00s -> 7022.32s]  It's really not hard at all anymore.
[7024.00s -> 7033.34s]  It's not hard at all.
[7034.30s -> 7035.57s]  Stop.
[7035.57s -> 7036.05s]  EG.
[7039.63s -> 7040.67s]  I like this music.
[7040.75s -> 7045.18s]  Sounds like a grandfather clock.
[7045.18s -> 7046.30s]  Oh, never mind.
[7046.30s -> 7047.18s]  We need a woodcutter.
[7048.14s -> 7048.70s]  That's me.
[7048.70s -> 7049.10s]  I got it.
[7049.74s -> 7064.98s]  I'm getting a sandwich from Subway.
[7066.34s -> 7067.41s]  I know.
[7067.97s -> 7068.85s]  I try not to.
[7069.89s -> 7073.66s]  Who would do that?
[7078.06s -> 7079.02s]  Can we just chop these?
[7081.30s -> 7084.10s]  All three of us are like standing here.
[7085.68s -> 7087.52s]  Well, if you don't chop it, you can't go around.
[7092.24s -> 7093.84s]  Dude, somebody has to deal with those.
[7093.84s -> 7095.12s]  Somebody has to deal with those peanuts.
[7095.76s -> 7099.04s]  We're walking around each person just standing,
[7099.04s -> 7101.68s]  holding track, waiting to place them.
[7101.68s -> 7104.08s]  There's an infinite amount of track being created.
[7104.08s -> 7105.36s]  When do I get upgrades to my teams?
[7105.36s -> 7106.32s]  Don't forget those.
[7106.32s -> 7107.28s]  Don't forget that bucket.
[7107.28s -> 7109.20s]  And don't forget helping me with these beandits.
[7110.56s -> 7111.92s]  And fuck your beandits.
[7112.96s -> 7115.12s]  Uh, we need to go north, I think.
[7116.58s -> 7116.90s]  East.
[7118.34s -> 7123.23s]  And take the bridge.
[7125.33s -> 7126.77s]  I told you not to leave.
[7126.77s -> 7128.93s]  I told you not to leave the bucket.
[7129.01s -> 7131.73s]  And you didn't listen to me.
[7133.30s -> 7134.66s]  I mean, where's the bucket?
[7135.38s -> 7135.86s]  I haven't.
[7136.74s -> 7138.74s]  I don't care where the bucket is.
[7141.68s -> 7143.28s]  I don't care.
[7146.03s -> 7147.15s]  Okay, I give up.
[7147.15s -> 7147.55s]  You win.
[7148.43s -> 7154.58s]  Can we get more bridges?
[7156.18s -> 7157.30s]  I'm just on wood duty.
[7167.70s -> 7168.34s]  This is wrong.
[7169.06s -> 7171.50s]  We can dig down.
[7172.54s -> 7174.74s]  Go down.
[7175.30s -> 7177.46s]  No, not okay.
[7177.46s -> 7178.66s]  Well, you just made that harder.
[7178.98s -> 7179.86s]  You know, we're good.
[7179.86s -> 7181.70s]  You guys gotta leave space on either side.
[7182.90s -> 7183.70s]  Did you get that achievement?
[7183.70s -> 7184.10s]  We're gonna get stuck.
[7185.06s -> 7186.50s]  Done.
[7187.06s -> 7191.41s]  What, you want a pizza, too?
[7191.97s -> 7192.53s]  We're done.
[7192.53s -> 7192.93s]  Just a second.
[7192.93s -> 7193.49s]  It's gonna explode.
[7194.93s -> 7195.41s]  This bucket.
[7195.41s -> 7197.41s]  You guys gotta have some foresight.
[7200.54s -> 7201.74s]  Have some foresight.
[7201.74s -> 7202.38s]  It's Alex.
[7202.38s -> 7203.58s]  This is really easy.
[7203.58s -> 7205.18s]  We have 40 tracks.
[7206.54s -> 7209.18s]  Our train is auto-destroying everything.
[7210.22s -> 7212.38s]  It's auto-collecting everything it destroys.
[7212.38s -> 7214.30s]  Guys, so easy.
[7214.30s -> 7215.90s]  You won't mind if I go ahead and complete this.
[7216.94s -> 7217.66s]  Please explode.
[7222.98s -> 7224.34s]  All right, let's upgrade.
[7226.83s -> 7227.63s]  No, wait, number four.
[7230.78s -> 7233.42s]  Increases the efficiency of neighboring wagons.
[7233.42s -> 7235.26s]  I don't think we need any more efficiency.
[7235.26s -> 7236.62s]  We are as efficient as we can get.
[7237.26s -> 7238.46s]  I think we could be more efficient.
[7238.46s -> 7240.46s]  Why not get another storage cart?
[7241.58s -> 7248.22s]  Please put it in the correct space in your rush.
[7248.22s -> 7249.98s]  Dinosaur's having a fit.
[7249.98s -> 7251.82s]  Oh, it really is the second storage cart.
[7252.06s -> 7253.26s]  Oh, two storage carts.
[7253.26s -> 7260.11s]  I thought it was an upgrade, but it does say new wagon.
[7262.24s -> 7263.84s]  Do you want to live so much, baby?
[7263.84s -> 7267.60s]  Baby, you should just do it on your own because I'm fucking...
[7270.72s -> 7272.24s]  Okay, what is going on with these?
[7273.92s -> 7275.76s]  I'm gonna address my stream at the moment.
[7277.76s -> 7279.10s]  Co-op game.
[7280.30s -> 7283.68s]  Person you're playing with hates the thing you're doing.
[7285.98s -> 7287.42s]  This is happening again.
[7288.14s -> 7294.06s]  I got guilted by my mom to keep playing the train game twice.
[7294.06s -> 7295.42s]  I think I got guilted twice.
[7295.42s -> 7297.42s]  I just keep letting, I'm a pushover.
[7297.42s -> 7299.74s]  Mom probably thinks this is really cute and fun.
[7299.74s -> 7303.90s]  How many comments about the dinosaur have been made, do you think?
[7310.03s -> 7310.27s]  What?
[7311.15s -> 7312.19s]  How many comments about like,
[7312.19s -> 7313.95s]  oh, this is so cute for the dinosaur.
[7313.95s -> 7314.91s]  Do you think it's gonna happen?
[7315.95s -> 7318.22s]  What are you talking about?
[7319.58s -> 7322.38s]  I'm talking about once since you've kept playing,
[7322.38s -> 7325.58s]  we've gotten a new party member who's this awesome,
[7325.58s -> 7328.06s]  cute dinosaur that is really effective.
[7328.06s -> 7330.22s]  By the way, the reason why this is probably so easy
[7330.22s -> 7332.70s]  is because we have the dinosaur buddy.
[7333.66s -> 7338.69s]  I mean, yeah, even if he sucked, it would be 33%.
[7339.33s -> 7341.49s]  Well, if he sucked, really bad.
[7341.49s -> 7342.93s]  Please explode, please explode.
[7345.86s -> 7347.62s]  No one is even using tools.
[7349.70s -> 7350.50s]  And you're gonna tell me,
[7351.06s -> 7352.74s]  do you think endless mode is gonna end soon?
[7352.74s -> 7354.42s]  Do you think it's gonna change dramatically
[7354.42s -> 7356.02s]  if we went to an entirely different biome?
[7356.02s -> 7356.66s]  Guess what changed?
[7357.62s -> 7358.98s]  Well, we're about to do it again.
[7358.98s -> 7361.06s]  And this has gotten a little more difficult.
[7362.83s -> 7364.51s]  This is the easiest one yet.
[7364.51s -> 7365.71s]  Well, there's no trees.
[7365.71s -> 7370.02s]  So we need a lot of chops, fast.
[7370.66s -> 7371.22s]  I got it.
[7372.10s -> 7373.30s]  Because we need to build bridges.
[7373.94s -> 7374.58s]  But you don't.
[7376.77s -> 7378.69s]  Now the station looks like a cactus.
[7380.82s -> 7381.46s]  That's pretty cool.
[7381.46s -> 7382.26s]  You don't think that's cool?
[7383.14s -> 7394.06s]  All right.
[7394.06s -> 7397.42s]  Listen, I'm just very hungry, very tired.
[7399.36s -> 7401.20s]  Oh, why don't you just call in?
[7401.20s -> 7402.88s]  And I want to be able to drown.
[7404.40s -> 7406.96s]  No, I'm on the road to commander.
[7408.32s -> 7409.52s]  What are you talking about?
[7409.52s -> 7410.72s]  What do you mean the road to commander?
[7411.44s -> 7412.45s]  What does that mean?
[7413.17s -> 7414.69s]  What game is commander?
[7415.73s -> 7416.77s]  You're playing League?
[7416.77s -> 7418.53s]  Do you really not remember that?
[7418.53s -> 7419.33s]  League of Legends?
[7420.13s -> 7420.85s]  Oh my God.
[7420.85s -> 7421.41s]  Are you playing?
[7423.09s -> 7429.28s]  That was the original YouTube
[7429.28s -> 7432.08s]  on the actual machinima channel thing to do.
[7434.62s -> 7436.38s]  To record your road to commander
[7436.38s -> 7438.22s]  and call of duty, which was like max level.
[7440.72s -> 7441.36s]  Oh, okay.
[7442.32s -> 7443.92s]  Oh, now it sounds.
[7443.92s -> 7444.48s]  Now I get it.
[7444.48s -> 7445.92s]  Okay, now I get why he spent
[7445.92s -> 7447.52s]  this much time saying road to commander.
[7447.52s -> 7448.64s]  Now it makes sense.
[7448.64s -> 7450.00s]  Can you get inside the lines?
[7450.64s -> 7451.76s]  No, I'm going to bed.
[7453.36s -> 7454.88s]  Well, this is tier three.
[7454.88s -> 7455.84s]  New biome incoming.
[7455.84s -> 7457.12s]  It's a snow biome.
[7457.12s -> 7459.52s]  And I know you love these snow levels.
[7459.52s -> 7461.28s]  It's just trees.
[7461.28s -> 7463.20s]  He did love the ice in the last game.
[7463.20s -> 7463.92s]  Yeah, I remember that.
[7463.92s -> 7464.42s]  He did.
[7464.42s -> 7468.08s]  It's the same thing, Ed.
[7469.72s -> 7472.84s]  Okay, I'm desperately trying to fix this.
[7472.84s -> 7477.75s]  Does it go faster over ice?
[7479.03s -> 7479.99s]  I don't know.
[7479.99s -> 7481.03s]  It's the same thing.
[7481.03s -> 7482.39s]  What does that ever stop you from playing?
[7482.39s -> 7483.35s]  I don't know.
[7484.39s -> 7485.51s]  That was so sad.
[7491.60s -> 7492.72s]  Yeah, the slippery ice.
[7493.86s -> 7495.30s]  Dino's clearing ice though.
[7496.96s -> 7499.28s]  You walk slower on it.
[7499.28s -> 7503.64s]  Oh, don't get stuck back here.
[7503.64s -> 7504.44s]  We need that pickaxe.
[7505.08s -> 7519.11s]  Are we going up and right?
[7520.07s -> 7521.27s]  Or which way are we going?
[7521.27s -> 7521.75s]  I think...
[7522.79s -> 7525.03s]  Just go that way, go that way, go that way.
[7525.03s -> 7525.99s]  Just go the way you're going.
[7525.99s -> 7527.35s]  Oh, why is it respawning?
[7528.39s -> 7531.43s]  There's snow coming back.
[7533.75s -> 7534.79s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7534.79s -> 7535.19s]  Where's the...
[7536.55s -> 7538.31s]  Where's my tool?
[7538.31s -> 7539.67s]  What is going on?
[7539.67s -> 7540.71s]  Who sprinted?
[7540.71s -> 7541.21s]  My tools.
[7542.31s -> 7544.39s]  The ash really doesn't even make you go faster.
[7545.03s -> 7545.75s]  It does though.
[7547.27s -> 7548.63s]  All right, turn it out.
[7548.63s -> 7549.27s]  Turn it down here.
[7550.23s -> 7556.20s]  The snow is fucking me up.
[7556.92s -> 7558.71s]  I can't even get rid of the snow.
[7559.51s -> 7561.35s]  I believe that is its intended purpose.
[7563.28s -> 7564.08s]  Oh, I...
[7565.36s -> 7569.78s]  There's the bucket, bucket, water bucket.
[7573.96s -> 7578.44s]  What stir won't talk to me for a month, says my mom.
[7578.44s -> 7578.76s]  Lol.
[7579.64s -> 7580.76s]  And she says lol.
[7580.76s -> 7581.72s]  I don't know what this means.
[7581.72s -> 7582.22s]  Lol.
[7583.24s -> 7586.24s]  Call your mother.
[7591.11s -> 7592.31s]  Call your mother.
[7592.31s -> 7594.31s]  Don't craft any tracks for 40 seconds.
[7594.31s -> 7596.23s]  Apparently, we did an achievement.
[7597.11s -> 7601.72s]  All right, but we do need stone in here like pretty soon.
[7601.72s -> 7602.60s]  I'm just mining it.
[7603.96s -> 7606.16s]  There's not much else.
[7606.96s -> 7608.24s]  The stone is not really that...
[7609.92s -> 7610.72s]  What do you mean we're stuck?
[7614.45s -> 7615.17s]  What do you mean?
[7615.97s -> 7616.69s]  We're dead.
[7616.69s -> 7617.01s]  We lose.
[7617.01s -> 7617.41s]  No, we're not.
[7617.41s -> 7617.65s]  What?
[7617.65s -> 7617.97s]  How?
[7618.85s -> 7619.57s]  We can't get through.
[7620.37s -> 7621.33s]  I can't break that.
[7621.33s -> 7621.81s]  I can't break it.
[7623.09s -> 7624.29s]  Oh, I can, I can, I can, I can.
[7625.97s -> 7627.57s]  Dino, dino, dino, dino, dino.
[7627.57s -> 7628.29s]  Down to me.
[7628.29s -> 7629.01s]  Track, dino.
[7629.81s -> 7630.61s]  Oh no, I'm stuck.
[7631.25s -> 7633.65s]  And then I was the one who saved it of all people.
[7636.92s -> 7639.80s]  And built the back way bridge.
[7642.32s -> 7645.20s]  You had the opportunity to like get out of here.
[7645.20s -> 7646.16s]  But you chose.
[7647.12s -> 7650.48s]  You chose to put that track down.
[7650.48s -> 7652.64s]  You could have been like, oh no, no, no, no.
[7652.64s -> 7654.56s]  Oh, I didn't get there.
[7654.56s -> 7655.36s]  Oh, wow.
[7655.36s -> 7657.12s]  There was nothing that could be done.
[7657.12s -> 7658.24s]  You could have done that.
[7658.24s -> 7659.12s]  That could have been you.
[7659.12s -> 7659.84s]  All right, which ways?
[7660.64s -> 7661.76s]  I don't even know what's mine.
[7661.76s -> 7662.24s]  Right ahead.
[7662.64s -> 7663.92s]  How do we even get over here?
[7663.92s -> 7665.44s]  This is, we need to, we need path.
[7665.44s -> 7666.24s]  We need wood.
[7667.68s -> 7669.32s]  How do we, we can't get up there.
[7670.20s -> 7671.24s]  Oh, right in the down.
[7671.24s -> 7671.88s]  Get the bridge.
[7671.88s -> 7672.84s]  Yeah, we get a bridge.
[7673.72s -> 7678.31s]  The fuck out of my way.
[7679.35s -> 7683.28s]  I don't think we can do this, guys.
[7684.32s -> 7686.44s]  I mean, it's pretty buried in there.
[7687.24s -> 7688.87s]  Is that, we need the axe.
[7688.87s -> 7691.68s]  Pickaxe, I don't even know who has it.
[7691.68s -> 7692.72s]  I'm dashing.
[7692.72s -> 7693.44s]  Out of my way.
[7694.80s -> 7696.16s]  I don't think we can do this.
[7697.20s -> 7700.10s]  The music stopped and it stopped.
[7700.34s -> 7702.18s]  And it stopped for anyone else ominous much.
[7703.06s -> 7707.30s]  That's just where the.
[7707.30s -> 7708.02s]  All right, I got it.
[7708.02s -> 7708.42s]  It's clear.
[7711.56s -> 7715.19s]  It's a save point.
[7715.83s -> 7718.82s]  Look, dude, fuck it.
[7718.82s -> 7720.18s]  Let's just go to the next biome.
[7720.18s -> 7720.90s]  Let's just see it all.
[7721.70s -> 7721.94s]  Cool.
[7721.94s -> 7723.46s]  Let's save and come back tomorrow.
[7724.26s -> 7728.56s]  We're not going to do that.
[7728.56s -> 7730.16s]  We're not going to do that.
[7736.05s -> 7736.53s]  All right.
[7736.53s -> 7739.09s]  Doesn't the steam from the engine melt the snow or something?
[7743.97s -> 7745.25s]  No, don't, don't, don't.
[7745.25s -> 7746.13s]  Why would you do that?
[7746.13s -> 7748.05s]  Why would you just do that blindly?
[7748.93s -> 7749.43s]  What?
[7750.53s -> 7754.26s]  You don't want dynamite.
[7755.22s -> 7757.33s]  We got an extra.
[7757.33s -> 7759.25s]  We got three wagons we could add.
[7759.25s -> 7759.65s]  Nope.
[7759.65s -> 7761.65s]  Let's add like a new engine.
[7761.65s -> 7762.93s]  No, no, no, no.
[7762.93s -> 7763.43s]  No.
[7764.85s -> 7766.62s]  Hello.
[7769.22s -> 7770.02s]  I want to see the.
[7770.02s -> 7771.06s]  I want to see the new biome.
[7773.08s -> 7773.96s]  It's lava.
[7773.96s -> 7774.60s]  He called it.
[7775.08s -> 7776.12s]  Pumpkin scary.
[7779.19s -> 7779.83s]  Wow.
[7779.83s -> 7780.39s]  I bet.
[7780.39s -> 7780.63s]  All right.
[7780.63s -> 7783.59s]  If I get bumped into by Jerma one more time,
[7783.59s -> 7785.19s]  I'm going to quit before Stardust.
[7785.99s -> 7786.71s]  Isn't that the gold?
[7792.63s -> 7793.43s]  Okay.
[7793.75s -> 7794.39s]  This is different.
[7797.27s -> 7802.44s]  This is slightly different.
[7802.44s -> 7803.48s]  This just turns your head.
[7804.60s -> 7808.32s]  It's a good thing that I, I don't know,
[7809.75s -> 7818.20s]  have an IQ greater than one and thus I can compensate.
[7821.91s -> 7826.15s]  I'm pretty sure some root vegetables have IQs of one.
[7827.27s -> 7829.35s]  So, I mean, that's not even accurate.
[7830.24s -> 7832.64s]  But I just mean I have at least one.
[7832.64s -> 7833.68s]  That's what you need.
[7833.68s -> 7837.12s]  And vegetables could definitely succeed at the.
[7838.40s -> 7839.20s]  That's all I'm saying.
[7840.00s -> 7840.24s]  Yeah.
[7840.24s -> 7842.48s]  When they got three other dinosaurs carrying,
[7844.18s -> 7846.58s]  they don't have to show up for work because they ate too much glue.
[7854.39s -> 7855.43s]  How could there be water here?
[7856.31s -> 7859.68s]  And like, it's cool.
[7859.68s -> 7860.40s]  It's lava.
[7861.28s -> 7862.72s]  It's orange water.
[7865.33s -> 7866.05s]  Uh oh.
[7866.05s -> 7867.17s]  I can't fit.
[7867.17s -> 7869.97s]  Oh, I wonder if we got dynamite if we could blow up that rock.
[7873.00s -> 7873.32s]  Maybe.
[7875.64s -> 7878.74s]  Where's the bucket?
[7878.74s -> 7879.70s]  What's wrong?
[7879.70s -> 7880.18s]  Where's the bucket?
[7880.18s -> 7880.66s]  Where's the bucket?
[7881.86s -> 7882.82s]  That's in the front.
[7882.82s -> 7883.14s]  We got it.
[7883.14s -> 7883.38s]  Okay.
[7886.42s -> 7887.62s]  I mean, that's all.
[7887.62s -> 7889.30s]  Oh, you can't build bridges.
[7890.34s -> 7892.42s]  Um, why is it going?
[7893.62s -> 7893.94s]  What?
[7895.64s -> 7896.36s]  I'm dead.
[7896.36s -> 7897.08s]  Why are we dead?
[7898.12s -> 7899.52s]  Is that the dream?
[7899.52s -> 7902.48s]  Why are we, why are we parachute?
[7902.48s -> 7902.98s]  What?
[7905.49s -> 7906.53s]  Oh, you're on it.
[7906.53s -> 7907.65s]  Oh, I don't.
[7907.65s -> 7909.49s]  Yeah, we got exploded.
[7909.49s -> 7911.89s]  Is that the grim reaper?
[7912.93s -> 7914.29s]  It was weird looking.
[7914.93s -> 7916.77s]  I couldn't tell what it was.
[7919.97s -> 7921.09s]  Well, I was confused though,
[7921.09s -> 7923.41s]  because I couldn't build a bridge, but we would need to there.
[7924.45s -> 7926.76s]  Ah, that's so funny.
[7929.16s -> 7930.44s]  Lava biome too hard.
[7930.44s -> 7931.72s]  I got temporarily cocks.
[7932.74s -> 7935.22s]  All right, guys, you know, that was a great fun night.
[7935.22s -> 7938.90s]  I had a lot of fun, but I can't wait to just stuff my face.
[7939.14s -> 7940.74s]  My road to commander continues.
[7941.38s -> 7942.71s]  That was fun.
[7943.86s -> 7944.10s]  Yeah.
[7944.10s -> 7945.30s]  I like the train game.
[7945.30s -> 7946.10s]  The train game is fun.
[7946.10s -> 7949.94s]  Train game is fun, but train game may be too easy with four people.
[7950.50s -> 7951.62s]  I like the other game too,
[7951.62s -> 7953.94s]  but I also would kind of just rather play overcooked too.
[7955.46s -> 7956.82s]  They're almost the same.
[7956.82s -> 7958.34s]  And one has cheeseburgers, right?
[7959.30s -> 7961.91s]  You could, you could set it to heart.
[7961.91s -> 7963.27s]  Yeah, we could have set it to hard.
[7963.27s -> 7964.79s]  Have you played it overcooked?
[7966.13s -> 7966.53s]  Yes.
[7967.57s -> 7969.97s]  Oh, I haven't played it.
[7971.06s -> 7973.62s]  It's basically the moving game, but with food.
[7974.72s -> 7975.52s]  I like food.
[7976.40s -> 7977.76s]  You would probably really like that game.
[7977.76s -> 7981.76s]  I feel like you'd be that the remember House of Dead Ninjas.
[7982.48s -> 7984.71s]  Remember how you like got obsessed with that
[7984.71s -> 7986.55s]  and you got the world record for one at one point.
[7987.19s -> 7988.15s]  I still have it.
[7988.15s -> 7990.79s]  You still have the world record for a Super House of Dead Ninjas.
[7990.79s -> 7993.43s]  I had to get it back at one point, but I have it again now.
[7993.43s -> 7993.75s]  Okay.
[7993.75s -> 7996.07s]  Because I feel like that's one of those games that you would just,
[7996.07s -> 7998.79s]  okay, I'm just going to beat every game at every level as fast as I can.
[7999.51s -> 8000.71s]  I don't know.
[8001.67s -> 8003.11s]  And I would have to play the game.
[8003.91s -> 8008.13s]  Well, look at how far we got.
[8008.13s -> 8009.09s]  We did get very far.
[8009.65s -> 8013.30s]  That was just a nice nostalgia watching that.
[8013.30s -> 8013.86s]  That was fun.
[8014.66s -> 8016.82s]  Okay.
[8016.82s -> 8017.70s]  All right.
[8017.70s -> 8018.02s]  Okay.
[8019.06s -> 8020.02s]  Okay.
[8020.02s -> 8020.66s]  Name reveal.
[8020.66s -> 8021.62s]  We got the name reveal.
[8023.86s -> 8024.74s]  They got out quick.
[8025.86s -> 8027.38s]  Got out real fast.
[8027.38s -> 8028.34s]  Name reveal.
[8029.30s -> 8029.86s]  I'm out.
[8029.86s -> 8030.18s]  I'm out.
[8032.53s -> 8033.09s]  I'm out.
[8033.73s -> 8035.43s]  All right.
[8035.43s -> 8036.47s]  Goodbye, Star.
[8036.47s -> 8037.43s]  Thanks for playing.
[8037.43s -> 8038.23s]  Thanks for streaming.
[8039.27s -> 8041.19s]  Thanks for watching Star's chat.
[8041.19s -> 8041.83s]  Oh, he's already gone.
[8044.29s -> 8045.33s]  He's already dead.
[8048.52s -> 8049.67s]  Well, that was fun.
[8050.31s -> 8051.03s]  Yep.
[8051.03s -> 8052.68s]  That was good.
[8052.68s -> 8055.64s]  I'll let you get to your...
[8057.00s -> 8059.72s]  I'll let you say bye to your stream, but say bye to mine.
[8059.72s -> 8060.52s]  I'll say bye to yours.
[8061.96s -> 8064.28s]  So just before we go.
[8064.28s -> 8064.52s]  Sure.
[8065.16s -> 8072.08s]  I just wanted everybody to know how often and frequently
[8072.08s -> 8074.64s]  Jerma has been asking me to play Halo recently.
[8074.64s -> 8076.32s]  I was just trying to figure out if...
[8078.40s -> 8078.96s]  Yeah, I just haven't.
[8078.96s -> 8079.68s]  I haven't played it.
[8079.68s -> 8082.32s]  So I was looking for like someone to play it with.
[8082.32s -> 8085.78s]  And I was just like kind of throwing some lines up
[8085.78s -> 8086.90s]  to see if anybody had played it yet.
[8087.54s -> 8088.74s]  It's been like every day though.
[8089.70s -> 8091.92s]  Well, since about two days ago.
[8093.04s -> 8095.44s]  I wanted to wait a few days after it came out just to check it out.
[8100.64s -> 8102.16s]  Halo with the Dino.
[8104.29s -> 8105.09s]  Yeah.
[8105.09s -> 8106.29s]  Come on in Dino.
[8106.29s -> 8107.33s]  Three person Halo.
[8111.32s -> 8113.40s]  Dude, I don't even know who that person is.
[8114.36s -> 8120.24s]  He left before I could even see his name.
[8125.48s -> 8126.76s]  It's Styrr's mom.
[8129.62s -> 8132.10s]  Now that would be very, very interesting.
[8133.73s -> 8134.13s]  All right.
[8134.13s -> 8134.69s]  Bye everyone.
[8135.33s -> 8135.57s]  Yeah.
[8135.57s -> 8136.77s]  Thanks a lot for playing, Talix.
[8137.99s -> 8140.79s]  If you don't follow Talix or Styrr, they both stream.
[8140.79s -> 8141.99s]  They both were streaming.
[8145.75s -> 8146.55s]  Take care, Talix.
[8147.41s -> 8147.89s]  See you soon.
[8148.53s -> 8153.35s]  I'll play Reach with you, Jerma.
[8153.35s -> 8154.31s]  I'm playing it right now.
[8156.88s -> 8157.12s]  Yeah.
[8157.12s -> 8158.64s]  That's probably what we'll call it there tonight.
[8159.28s -> 8162.88s]  And that will conclude the non-canon co-op week.
[8163.60s -> 8167.56s]  You know something I did not think I was ever going to see
[8172.13s -> 8173.81s]  is I looked over here quite a few times
[8174.45s -> 8179.32s]  and I saw a lot of Nancy Drew demands.
[8183.81s -> 8185.57s]  I'm actually, I'm surprised.
[8186.29s -> 8188.05s]  I am very surprised by this.
[8188.85s -> 8193.09s]  But just know that I do have a ton of them.
[8193.65s -> 8199.75s]  So hey, anytime that there's something, nothing to do
[8199.75s -> 8200.95s]  and I'm just like, what do I want to do?
[8200.95s -> 8202.55s]  Maybe you might say it again.
[8202.55s -> 8203.67s]  Of course you will because I bought them.
[8211.80s -> 8213.00s]  But that's what we'll call it tonight.
[8215.60s -> 8217.04s]  And you will see me again.
[8217.04s -> 8218.56s]  I have this weekend.
[8219.36s -> 8225.12s]  I have actually Otto has to go in for a surgery.
[8226.28s -> 8227.24s]  Otto has surgery.
[8228.90s -> 8231.30s]  He's getting his teeth cleaned
[8232.26s -> 8238.26s]  and he also is getting a small little growth removed from his knee.
[8240.05s -> 8242.29s]  So take care of Otto.
[8249.67s -> 8250.79s]  It's very, very small.
[8254.12s -> 8254.92s]  Tooth removal?
[8254.92s -> 8256.28s]  No, no, no, just teeth cleaning.
[8258.34s -> 8259.54s]  I've worded that wrong.
[8259.54s -> 8260.90s]  He's getting his teeth cleaned
[8261.78s -> 8265.46s]  and then they're going to remove a small growth on his knee.
[8265.46s -> 8265.94s]  There you go.
[8268.34s -> 8270.50s]  Brushing your teeth is not surgery.
[8271.48s -> 8272.20s]  The other one is.
[8274.37s -> 8275.49s]  But you'll see me again.
[8275.49s -> 8277.89s]  I did make a promise that I have to keep
[8278.93s -> 8284.21s]  and that promise is on Tuesday we're going to start with DOS.
[8284.21s -> 8285.81s]  We're going to do another DOS night.
[8285.81s -> 8288.85s]  I did say I have to at least have my word be real
[8288.85s -> 8290.05s]  for some of the things I said.
[8291.09s -> 8293.01s]  We're going to go back to DOS on Tuesday.
[8297.43s -> 8298.07s]  Tuesday.
[8301.83s -> 8303.51s]  There's apparently been a ton of new additions.
[8305.92s -> 8306.88s]  Check it out.
[8306.88s -> 8309.67s]  Am I leaving?
[8309.67s -> 8311.67s]  Yeah, that's what I'm going to call it.
[8311.67s -> 8312.63s]  That was the plan tonight.
[8313.91s -> 8315.19s]  We had these two games lined up.
[8315.91s -> 8320.88s]  Play Ultima 4 maybe.
[8321.60s -> 8327.06s]  No, we did Nancy Drew last night.
[8327.06s -> 8328.90s]  Can't do two Nancy Drews in a row.
[8329.78s -> 8331.25s]  Got to space it out a little.
[8333.00s -> 8333.72s]  That was a lot of fun.
[8334.60s -> 8335.72s]  I think Train Game was...
[8337.83s -> 8339.91s]  I think they were equally as interesting.
[8339.91s -> 8343.03s]  I think Train Game was a little more engaging in a way.
[8343.67s -> 8344.31s]  But not really.
[8344.31s -> 8345.59s]  I mean, they're both fun.
[8347.01s -> 8348.85s]  That was Tools Up.
[8349.65s -> 8351.73s]  Which, by the way, if you're going to buy Tools Up,
[8351.73s -> 8353.33s]  just be really aware of this.
[8353.33s -> 8355.41s]  There's no online multiplayer.
[8355.41s -> 8356.77s]  You have to do Steam Remote Play.
[8356.77s -> 8358.13s]  That's the only way you get it to work.
[8358.13s -> 8359.25s]  Or Couch Co-op.
[8359.25s -> 8361.57s]  So if you're like, oh, I wanted to play that with one of my friends.
[8361.57s -> 8362.45s]  Oh, you'll get it.
[8363.09s -> 8366.34s]  You have to do the Remote Play.
[8366.90s -> 8367.78s]  That was not online.
[8370.16s -> 8371.20s]  This one is on rail.
[8371.20s -> 8372.00s]  This one is online.
[8375.97s -> 8377.81s]  And it was pretty fun.
[8378.92s -> 8380.04s]  I think this is an early access.
[8380.04s -> 8381.80s]  This just came out in early access, didn't it?
[8383.25s -> 8383.81s]  It's pretty good.
[8384.45s -> 8389.46s]  But we'll see you in a few days.
[8391.75s -> 8392.95s]  Tuesday, to be exact.
[8393.51s -> 8397.25s]  I'm going to go take care of Otto.
[8398.85s -> 8401.73s]  I will give him all of your love and mine.
[8402.37s -> 8407.32s]  This looks like an awesome mobile game.
[8409.73s -> 8414.69s]  Yeah, but isn't an awesome mobile game just a good game, you know?
[8415.57s -> 8418.79s]  That's not, it's all right.
[8418.79s -> 8419.59s]  It was fun.
[8422.72s -> 8423.04s]  No.
[8423.84s -> 8424.08s]  No.
[8424.80s -> 8428.39s]  But thanks again for watching.
[8429.03s -> 8430.24s]  See you Tuesday.
[8431.43s -> 8432.07s]  We'll do the bits.
[8433.19s -> 8436.39s]  I have to get this train sound off my computer.
[8437.03s -> 8442.10s]  Because it's still just here to exit the game.
[8445.17s -> 8447.73s]  Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[8447.73s -> 8448.05s]  Quit.
[8448.61s -> 8451.17s]  It's still playing.
[8451.17s -> 8451.57s]  There we go.
[8453.35s -> 8453.67s]  All right.
[8453.67s -> 8456.47s]  Let's go back about where were we?
[8456.47s -> 8457.35s]  Four, five hours?
[8457.35s -> 8458.07s]  Five hours ago.
[8459.19s -> 8469.30s]  Where were we at?
[8470.34s -> 8472.82s]  I'm actually surprised that Steam Remote Play held up that well.
[8473.54s -> 8480.37s]  I guess you just, you have to have a good connection to the people that you're playing with.
[8480.37s -> 8486.40s]  And the three of us are in a, you know, that Southwest sort of location.
[8488.40s -> 8492.16s]  I wonder how bad that would be if I would play with somebody from the East Coast or from Europe.
[8492.16s -> 8493.36s]  It would probably be horrible.
[8495.92s -> 8496.24s]  Maybe.
[8496.24s -> 8496.72s]  I don't know.
[8496.72s -> 8497.92s]  I don't have any experience with it, so.
[8500.92s -> 8503.88s]  But thank you to extra cheesy for the 500 bits.
[8504.68s -> 8509.04s]  What you didn't know was that I was the true player one this entire time.
[8509.04s -> 8512.80s]  I was controlling you, controlling the game, controlling their streams.
[8513.36s -> 8516.80s]  Just as right now I'm controlling you to read this.
[8516.80s -> 8520.80s]  I am Shrek and the universe is my onion, not yours.
[8521.52s -> 8528.16s]  I don't understand that last sentence, but thank you for the 500 bits.
[8532.12s -> 8533.08s]  Abomination zero.
[8533.08s -> 8533.96s]  Thanks to the 250.
[8534.60s -> 8536.28s]  Hygermia streams mean a lot to me.
[8536.28s -> 8539.48s]  My home life can be pretty shitty, but you make the nights more fun.
[8540.04s -> 8540.93s]  Don't ever change.
[8541.65s -> 8545.88s]  I don't really plan on it.
[8546.44s -> 8553.35s]  And I think I don't think I have the mental capacity to be able to do it.
[8555.14s -> 8557.59s]  So I really appreciate that.
[8557.59s -> 8558.95s]  Thank you so much for the 250.
[8560.53s -> 8562.93s]  Hopefully that home life can improve.
[8563.65s -> 8566.74s]  Thanks a lot for the 250.
[8566.74s -> 8567.54s]  Abomination zero.
[8570.26s -> 8570.98s]  Coldest fridge.
[8572.00s -> 8573.68s]  Thanks for the 500 bits.
[8574.72s -> 8576.80s]  Hey, Jerma, I hope you didn't forget what day it is today.
[8577.44s -> 8578.40s]  I did not.
[8578.40s -> 8580.32s]  We'll address that in a few minutes, though.
[8580.32s -> 8582.68s]  We'll address that in a few minutes.
[8588.34s -> 8589.22s]  It's a birthday today.
[8598.39s -> 8599.51s]  How old are you again?
[8601.32s -> 8601.88s]  How old are you?
[8607.56s -> 8608.12s]  19.
[8609.38s -> 8610.10s]  No, no, right.
[8610.10s -> 8611.30s]  Do you remember we tried to figure that out?
[8612.10s -> 8616.93s]  It's also my dad's birthday.
[8616.93s -> 8618.29s]  Happy birthday to your dad, too.
[8624.34s -> 8626.26s]  Hope you've been such a good boy this year.
[8630.23s -> 8631.27s]  Thanks for the 500 bits.
[8632.96s -> 8634.56s]  Happy fucking birthday.
[8637.33s -> 8639.49s]  To everybody that has a birthday today.
[8642.37s -> 8643.25s]  Not just one person.
[8648.72s -> 8650.56s]  How many people actually have a birthday here today?
[8651.04s -> 8654.42s]  Let's see.
[8654.42s -> 8658.82s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[8658.82s -> 8659.86s]  Quite a lot of us, actually.
[8660.50s -> 8663.89s]  Thanks for the 500 bits.
[8664.77s -> 8665.65s]  I don't forget.
[8666.53s -> 8667.73s]  I mean, I always forget,
[8667.73s -> 8669.73s]  but as long as I'm reminded every single day,
[8672.02s -> 8674.82s]  I will not forget if each day I'm told not to forget
[8674.82s -> 8676.02s]  until the day that it happens.
[8676.66s -> 8679.24s]  Thanks for the 500 bits.
[8679.80s -> 8682.66s]  Appreciate it.
[8682.66s -> 8685.17s]  Your birthday's tomorrow.
[8685.17s -> 8686.61s]  Happy birthday tomorrow.
[8686.61s -> 8690.07s]  I have to be reminded every day.
[8690.87s -> 8693.20s]  That's ADHD.
[8693.20s -> 8693.68s]  Yes, it is.
[8698.48s -> 8699.84s]  DarkSoul250, thanks for the...
[8702.90s -> 8704.42s]  DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[8706.52s -> 8707.96s]  Even though this week isn't real
[8707.96s -> 8709.56s]  and we're all in comas, it's been a lot of fun.
[8710.20s -> 8712.42s]  I'll see you all when we wake up.
[8713.46s -> 8715.30s]  Also, my mother legitimately wanted to know
[8715.30s -> 8716.50s]  why it took you eight hours
[8716.50s -> 8718.34s]  to beat a Nancy Drew game, by the way.
[8720.96s -> 8722.16s]  Because it was a long-ass game.
[8731.14s -> 8732.10s]  Midnight in Salem.
[8732.10s -> 8732.82s]  How long...
[8732.82s -> 8734.82s]  It's like a 10-hour game.
[8735.62s -> 8740.15s]  How long to beat Nancy Drew in Salem?
[8743.28s -> 8744.08s]  Nancy Drew...
[8747.28s -> 8747.76s]  Salem.
[8747.84s -> 8748.32s]  What's it called?
[8750.00s -> 8751.68s]  How long is Nancy Drew...
[8752.48s -> 8754.36s]  No, that's not right.
[8756.00s -> 8758.32s]  Midnight in Salem.
[8761.51s -> 8762.95s]  I'm the only person that's beaten the game,
[8762.95s -> 8764.23s]  so it's a seven-and-a-half-hour game.
[8764.79s -> 8775.51s]  But thank you, DarkSoul250, appreciate it.
[8775.51s -> 8778.55s]  UtopiaFox gave 10 community subs.
[8778.55s -> 8779.91s]  I think I missed one of them,
[8779.91s -> 8781.35s]  but I tried to catch them both.
[8782.15s -> 8784.07s]  That's the one thing when you stream
[8784.07s -> 8785.75s]  and you play with other people
[8786.63s -> 8788.15s]  and there's more than one person,
[8788.15s -> 8789.35s]  you have to find that minute
[8789.35s -> 8790.71s]  where you can just mute everybody
[8791.75s -> 8792.63s]  and then they go, what are you doing?
[8792.63s -> 8793.27s]  And it's like, I'm talking...
[8794.07s -> 8794.95s]  Hey, pick up...
[8794.95s -> 8795.67s]  What are you doing?
[8795.67s -> 8796.55s]  Are you stupid?
[8796.55s -> 8797.03s]  I'm trying to...
[8797.99s -> 8799.27s]  So it's easy to miss some stuff.
[8799.27s -> 8799.67s]  I'm sorry.
[8800.47s -> 8801.03s]  I'm sorry.
[8801.99s -> 8804.71s]  But thank you, Cole, KaoLegacy,
[8804.71s -> 8805.83s]  and UtopiaFox.
[8805.83s -> 8806.55s]  I think I got them,
[8806.55s -> 8807.35s]  but I'm just making sure.
[8808.23s -> 8811.24s]  Both the 10 community subs, appreciate it.
[8811.24s -> 8816.37s]  And we're talking about them.
[8816.37s -> 8817.91s]  Why don't we show them all?
[8826.77s -> 8828.45s]  Thank you so much, everybody, for your subs.
[8833.49s -> 8834.29s]  Really appreciate it.
[8835.01s -> 8839.03s]  Hey, that hurt.
[8839.67s -> 8843.44s]  I'm sorry, dude.
[8843.44s -> 8844.48s]  I'm sorry I didn't mean to bump you.
[8847.43s -> 8853.09s]  But again, thank you for subbing to this channel, as always.
[8853.73s -> 8858.31s]  We had a couple more bits come in.
[8858.31s -> 8860.07s]  We had TalksRay for 250.
[8860.63s -> 8863.19s]  Dingo the Dinosaur for Jerma Rumble, Jerma Venus.
[8864.23s -> 8867.83s]  We'll see.
[8868.63s -> 8870.31s]  We'll see.
[8870.87s -> 8874.72s]  Hey, DubskiDude, thanks for the 250.
[8874.72s -> 8876.32s]  Hey, Jerma, please don't ban me for this.
[8876.96s -> 8878.48s]  But I had to make a Reddit thread
[8878.48s -> 8879.84s]  about all the questionable stuff
[8879.84s -> 8880.80s]  you've been doing lately.
[8881.36s -> 8884.56s]  The thread got 700 upvotes and a few awards.
[8885.20s -> 8885.92s]  So I'm not the only one
[8885.92s -> 8887.36s]  who is concerned about your behavior.
[8887.92s -> 8889.68s]  I'm not subbed, so I can't link it.
[8889.68s -> 8890.96s]  But just look for the thread title
[8890.96s -> 8893.92s]  What's With All The Jerma Controversies.
[8893.92s -> 8895.12s]  I don't want to spread drama.
[8895.12s -> 8895.92s]  I really don't.
[8895.92s -> 8897.12s]  But someone has to say it.
[8897.12s -> 8898.72s]  I hope you can get back on track.
[8900.08s -> 8907.72s]  Hey, guys.
[8909.30s -> 8910.26s]  Oh, my God.
[8911.14s -> 8914.58s]  This is like, this is a long page.
[8914.58s -> 8916.02s]  Hey, guys, I'm kind of new to this community.
[8916.02s -> 8918.26s]  And I was really enjoying watching Jerma's content.
[8918.26s -> 8920.26s]  But I keep seeing talk of a bunch of controversies
[8920.26s -> 8920.82s]  he's been in.
[8921.70s -> 8923.86s]  It's weird because Jerma's a likable down-to-earth guy.
[8923.86s -> 8925.14s]  So it really doesn't make sense to me.
[8925.86s -> 8927.94s]  I'll list what I've been seeing lately so we can discuss.
[8928.90s -> 8933.65s]  Jerma regularly forces chat to sit through ad breaks.
[8934.45s -> 8935.65s]  I guess this one isn't so bad
[8935.65s -> 8937.25s]  because he does have to put food on the table.
[8937.25s -> 8939.25s]  But I'm not sure why Jerma drops so many ad breaks
[8939.25s -> 8940.93s]  when he already gets a ton of bits and subs.
[8941.49s -> 8944.13s]  He just randomly throws an ad break in whenever he wants.
[8944.13s -> 8946.21s]  I think one time he kept doing them over and over
[8946.21s -> 8947.89s]  and only stopping people started leaving.
[8948.69s -> 8949.97s]  He also doesn't.
[8950.77s -> 8952.92s]  Oh, so now this is real.
[8952.92s -> 8953.64s]  Okay, I get it.
[8955.35s -> 8956.71s]  This is a, okay.
[8957.67s -> 8961.60s]  That running ads in a row until people left.
[8961.60s -> 8962.72s]  I'm like, when did I do that?
[8965.92s -> 8968.08s]  Jerma's acting toxic towards his fans,
[8968.08s -> 8969.52s]  calling them stupid fucking idiot,
[8969.52s -> 8971.20s]  dumb fucking goddamn idiots.
[8971.20s -> 8972.32s]  Motherfuckers.
[8972.32s -> 8974.40s]  And threatening to permanently ban people over nothing.
[8975.12s -> 8977.68s]  I think I might have seen a few people get banned for outright
[8977.68s -> 8979.52s]  for just recalling him short, which is rude.
[8979.52s -> 8981.04s]  But perma-banning is overkill.
[8985.04s -> 8987.60s]  This is just a, what the fuck?
[8989.25s -> 8992.05s]  Jerma encouraging his fans to spam comment threads
[8992.05s -> 8994.05s]  that he beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[8994.69s -> 8997.62s]  I have firsthand experience seeing people do this
[8997.62s -> 8999.22s]  on Reddit, YouTube, and MySpace.
[8999.78s -> 9001.22s]  So I know that's likely true.
[9003.88s -> 9005.00s]  All right, that one's true.
[9006.21s -> 9009.97s]  But no, but the only true part about that is
[9011.09s -> 9014.69s]  I said if somebody ever says Jerma died to Pinwheel,
[9014.69s -> 9017.17s]  which is a lie, then you need to counteract that
[9017.17s -> 9019.57s]  with no, he didn't, he beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[9020.61s -> 9021.33s]  That's all I said.
[9021.33s -> 9022.85s]  I didn't say to go spamming him.
[9022.85s -> 9023.57s]  Why would I say that?
[9024.21s -> 9028.21s]  I'm saying if you see counteract the complete false misinformation.
[9028.85s -> 9034.42s]  Jerma was doing cruel IRL pranks.
[9034.42s -> 9036.58s]  I remember one time Jerma did a video where he bought
[9036.58s -> 9039.54s]  a bunch of cakes and threw them at random dock workers.
[9040.34s -> 9042.26s]  I guess it was supposed to be a reference to TF2.
[9042.26s -> 9043.70s]  He ended up hitting a guy right in the face
[9043.70s -> 9046.18s]  and it dazed him to where he couldn't walk straight.
[9046.18s -> 9047.30s]  It was really graphic.
[9048.34s -> 9052.20s]  Jerma talking about his personal fetishes on stream.
[9053.52s -> 9056.40s]  Like getting his chest hairs plucked with tweezers and CBT.
[9057.44s -> 9058.00s]  And eating.
[9058.72s -> 9060.32s]  I personally wasn't around for that stuff,
[9060.32s -> 9061.36s]  but it sounds like it was gross.
[9062.00s -> 9064.00s]  Some people are just really open, okay?
[9065.86s -> 9067.54s]  Talk shit about his best friends
[9067.54s -> 9069.30s]  and scams them out of a lot of money.
[9070.58s -> 9072.90s]  I remember Starr and Jerma collabs.
[9072.90s -> 9074.26s]  It's really sad to see they had split up,
[9074.26s -> 9076.26s]  but I didn't know that Jerma had stolen money from him.
[9079.01s -> 9082.71s]  Dude, if you would just, there are so many just lies
[9082.71s -> 9083.59s]  in this community.
[9083.59s -> 9087.19s]  It's like, there's nobody can know the truth now.
[9087.19s -> 9089.03s]  There's so many falsehoods.
[9091.09s -> 9092.53s]  Even coming from me too.
[9093.25s -> 9099.57s]  Jerma harassing a streamer called GrillmasterXBBQ.
[9100.13s -> 9101.65s]  I only caught the last half of the incident,
[9101.65s -> 9103.01s]  but Jerma seriously went off the rails
[9103.01s -> 9104.77s]  and was talking mad shit about him.
[9104.77s -> 9107.33s]  I don't even know who he was until he went ape shit on him.
[9107.33s -> 9109.57s]  I think Twitch admins might have told Jerma to lay off.
[9110.77s -> 9114.44s]  Jerma burning a live Wasp on stream.
[9114.44s -> 9117.08s]  That was fake CGI.
[9120.98s -> 9123.22s]  Everyone in the comments is talking about how much of a psycho I am.
[9126.05s -> 9127.97s]  Okay, down in the comments threads.
[9127.97s -> 9131.57s]  I also find it idiotic that he tried to copyright the planets
[9131.57s -> 9133.09s]  of the fucking solar system.
[9133.09s -> 9133.97s]  Like, what are you, what?
[9134.69s -> 9136.45s]  Glad that shit got shot down right away.
[9136.45s -> 9137.73s]  But seriously, what kind of freak thinks
[9137.73s -> 9139.17s]  he can just copyright planets?
[9139.73s -> 9140.61s]  Delusional much?
[9141.57s -> 9144.93s]  Anyway, his stupid juke spamming fans pretend to be...
[9154.18s -> 9155.06s]  This is like all...
[9155.70s -> 9160.90s]  I heard he also killed Glooman.
[9160.90s -> 9162.90s]  Glooman's still alive, so that's not real.
[9163.62s -> 9166.77s]  I love this post.
[9166.77s -> 9167.49s]  I'm calling it now.
[9167.49s -> 9169.49s]  Someone thirsty for drama is going to read this post
[9169.49s -> 9172.53s]  and take it seriously and then make a YouTube video on it
[9172.53s -> 9174.29s]  without realizing it's satire.
[9192.85s -> 9194.93s]  This does have 700 uploads, though.
[9195.73s -> 9197.20s]  Here, if you want to go through...
[9197.76s -> 9199.60s]  If you want to go through all the horrible things I've done
[9199.60s -> 9200.88s]  in my career, there it is.
[9201.84s -> 9208.39s]  And that was DubskiDude.
[9208.39s -> 9209.19s]  Thank you, DubskiDude.
[9209.99s -> 9213.36s]  Where's my apology?
[9213.36s -> 9221.11s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[9227.24s -> 9231.67s]  Public apology required now.
[9232.79s -> 9234.31s]  That was not a good apology.
[9235.27s -> 9236.55s]  Okay, sure, guys.
[9236.63s -> 9239.91s]  I'm sorry for the made-up things about me.
[9241.03s -> 9244.56s]  But doesn't that happen in a lot of apologies?
[9245.20s -> 9246.88s]  Guys, I just got to tell you, I'm sorry,
[9246.88s -> 9248.80s]  but all these things are made up about me.
[9250.32s -> 9251.12s]  That does happen.
[9251.12s -> 9251.84s]  That just happens.
[9258.40s -> 9262.24s]  Guys, just want to hit you with some stuff going on.
[9262.24s -> 9263.60s]  I want to just say I'm very sorry
[9264.16s -> 9265.76s]  for the way that you all feel about me
[9265.76s -> 9267.04s]  and how none of it's real.
[9267.04s -> 9267.68s]  It's not true.
[9267.68s -> 9268.18s]  Sorry.
[9272.00s -> 9272.72s]  All right.
[9273.28s -> 9281.03s]  Everyone deserves a second chance.
[9281.03s -> 9281.53s]  Thank you.
[9282.09s -> 9283.37s]  Thank you, MessingY.
[9284.49s -> 9284.99s]  Thank you.
[9285.61s -> 9292.50s]  See you guys on Tuesday.
[9293.14s -> 9296.90s]  Thanks for watching the week of non-canon streams.
[9298.02s -> 9301.91s]  Some of those could be retroactively canon, I think.
[9302.55s -> 9303.51s]  Maybe one or two of them.
[9303.51s -> 9304.31s]  What was it, four?
[9304.31s -> 9305.27s]  Last four days in a row?
[9306.31s -> 9307.59s]  Maybe two of those were canon.
[9308.55s -> 9313.19s]  Good night, guys.
[9313.75s -> 9315.42s]  See you Tuesday.
[9332.44s -> 9335.22s]  I'm not going to turn the stream off yet
[9335.22s -> 9337.14s]  because it's at four hours and 59 minutes.
[9338.18s -> 9341.46s]  And I want this to be a five-hour stream.
[9342.10s -> 9343.70s]  Because that's just going to bug me.
[9347.21s -> 9352.20s]  Padding your stats by 20, 30 seconds.
[9352.76s -> 9354.84s]  Add it to the list of controversies.
[9355.56s -> 9362.97s]  You gaming analytics now.
[9366.54s -> 9367.04s]  All right.
[9367.66s -> 9368.46s]  Good night, guys.
[9368.46s -> 9369.10s]  See you Tuesday.
[9384.12s -> 9386.36s]  Real quick, C4G, thanks for the 250.
[9387.08s -> 9388.60s]  The company that made House Flipper
[9388.60s -> 9390.20s]  and Car Mechanics in me later
[9390.20s -> 9392.36s]  appeared to be publishing a Jesus game.
[9393.32s -> 9397.45s]  It has a Steam page, but the trailer looks like
[9397.45s -> 9399.53s]  it's a fake game from a Coke commercial.
[9401.61s -> 9402.11s]  What?
[9402.73s -> 9410.70s]  All right, goodbye.
[9411.90s -> 9412.40s]  Goodbye.
[9414.33s -> 9414.83s]  Goodbye.
[9420.57s -> 9421.61s]  No, I'm out of here.
[9429.03s -> 9430.31s]  I am Jesus...
[9430.95s -> 9433.67s]  Am Jesus Christ is the name of the game.
[9434.47s -> 9438.87s]  No, I don't want to show this trailer.
[9439.59s -> 9441.19s]  Because I want to be...
[9441.19s -> 9443.11s]  I don't want to know anything about this.
[9443.11s -> 9443.61s]  Nope.
[9443.61s -> 9444.31s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[9444.31s -> 9445.51s]  If you want to look, go for it.
[9445.59s -> 9446.07s]  I don't want to.
[9446.71s -> 9447.21s]  Nope.
[9453.96s -> 9455.32s]  I don't want to see a damn thing about this.
[9465.53s -> 9468.47s]  I've skipped 10 seconds into that trailer
[9468.47s -> 9470.31s]  and I immediately do not want to see anything else.
[9472.84s -> 9473.34s]  No way.
[9475.62s -> 9476.34s]  Whenever that comes out,
[9476.34s -> 9482.82s]  we're gonna have to think about playing that one.
[9482.82s -> 9484.26s]  Thank you, C4G, for the 250.
[9484.26s -> 9489.62s]  And look, it's 501, which is somehow worse than 459.
[9490.26s -> 9493.69s]  God damn it.
[9493.69s -> 9494.49s]  All right, see you Tuesday.
[9494.49s -> 9495.29s]  Goodbye.
