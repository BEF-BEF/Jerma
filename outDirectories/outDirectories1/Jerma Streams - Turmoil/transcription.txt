[2.49s -> 5.21s]  Alright, what are we doing? Uh, Turmoil. I wanna try Turmoil.
[5.21s -> 11.62s]  Peglin. Yep, Peglin's on the list.
[11.62s -> 15.30s]  Listen, uh, Turmoil looks really cool. I'm really interested.
[15.30s -> 27.99s]  This is a game where you get oil or something.
[27.99s -> 33.62s]  Do a WoW stream and it's out.
[36.70s -> 65.05s]  Okay. So, start new campaign, right? Let me do the setting.
[65.05s -> 68.73s]  Graphics. Good. Very good. 60 FPS.
[69.69s -> 75.42s]  Uh, yep, yep, yep. Okay. Audio is fine.
[76.22s -> 81.06s]  Everything seems good to go. Okay, let's start.
[81.78s -> 97.94s]  Okay. So, select, choose your character. I'm gonna play as Joshua.
[97.94s -> 102.12s]  Howdy, partner. This dude has been herding cattle
[102.12s -> 105.40s]  long enough to know that nights on the prairie are cold and lonely.
[105.40s -> 108.34s]  Hope earning money with oil is as easy as throwing lasso.
[109.56s -> 113.91s]  Yes. Hi there, future oil baron. Welcome to my soon-to-be-lovely town.
[113.91s -> 117.00s]  The oil industry will be booming here. Let's get to work.
[117.00s -> 123.40s]  Click on the wagon and I'll show you the basics of oil drilling.
[123.40s -> 125.24s]  Hop on and I'll take you to the oil site.
[125.24s -> 129.82s]  Welcome to your first oil mining operation.
[129.82s -> 132.38s]  Just follow my instructions and the oil will be flowing in no time.
[132.38s -> 136.46s]  Before you can start drilling for oil, you have to know where to drill.
[136.46s -> 140.90s]  Hire a dowser to take care of this.
[140.90s -> 165.56s]  You found oil. It's time to start drilling. Select the oil rig.
[165.56s -> 170.73s]  Oil can be always be found somewhere below a dowser.
[170.73s -> 176.14s]  So, place the rig right here. Literally hit me in the head with a wrench.
[176.78s -> 180.22s]  Drag downwards from this point and release at the other point to connect the oil.
[180.22s -> 187.74s]  Drag downwards from this point and release at the other point.
[187.74s -> 196.54s]  How far down should I go? Oh, okay.
[201.18s -> 205.82s]  I know I'm going to love this game. I'm going to be obsessed.
[205.82s -> 208.86s]  You struck oil, but where should you take it?
[208.86s -> 212.52s]  The left ink, of course. Select the horse wagon.
[212.52s -> 216.92s]  Put a wagon here. I'll make like oil and unload it in my company. Cha-ching.
[216.92s -> 230.07s]  They wouldn't have said that back in like the fucking 1100s.
[230.07s -> 239.26s]  This introduction ends when you brought the cash amount back up to 1350.
[239.26s -> 244.20s]  Okay, got it. Back to town.
[244.20s -> 247.18s]  Good job. Now it's time for the real work.
[247.18s -> 251.50s]  Come to town hall and meet your rivals and get yourself a parcel of land for your next venture.
[251.50s -> 253.66s]  Oh no, don't make me do it.
[253.66s -> 256.94s]  Don't make me do the thing that won worst impression of the year last year.
[256.94s -> 260.06s]  No, I don't want to do it. I will.
[260.06s -> 270.06s]  Hello there. Does being a lawyer sound interesting?
[270.79s -> 274.74s]  Well, in truth, it's kind of boring and I couldn't handle it.
[274.74s -> 278.82s]  I've got a serious case of oil fever and the only cure is finding oil.
[284.34s -> 286.42s]  That's what literally lost.
[287.38s -> 294.98s]  That was the worst thing I ever did last year, apparently.
[294.98s -> 300.90s]  20 grand for what? It still is.
[300.90s -> 302.66s]  I know. I'm just reminding you.
[302.66s -> 304.02s]  You can't vote for that twice, though.
[304.02s -> 305.14s]  That's important to know.
[305.14s -> 319.38s]  Why can I barely hear this?
[368.89s -> 373.53s]  Oh my God. I just came to a really crazy realization about the way my brain works.
[374.25s -> 379.21s]  The reason why that's the way that I do the Daniel Day Lewis,
[379.21s -> 384.36s]  I drink your milkshake routine is because I'm skipping through the fucking video.
[403.61s -> 407.03s]  That's why I'm doing that.
[410.65s -> 411.61s]  What the fuck?
[414.17s -> 415.61s]  Yeah, don't come snivel.
[422.55s -> 425.46s]  This is insane.
[425.46s -> 430.10s]  It's from me skipping through the movie because I like want to maybe get to a scene
[430.10s -> 432.10s]  or maybe I'm skipping through a certain scene.
[437.53s -> 438.81s]  It's really weird to think about that.
[446.15s -> 448.47s]  Anyways, let's play this game.
[454.89s -> 455.61s]  It's like this.
[457.61s -> 459.93s]  Yeah, I've seen this. This is one of my favorite videos.
[479.66s -> 481.50s]  It's not possible for me to not laugh at this video.
[481.50s -> 482.30s]  I'll try.
[482.30s -> 485.46s]  I'm going to try as hard as I can to not laugh at this video.
[485.46s -> 487.14s]  It's cheating, though, because it's impossible.
[487.14s -> 494.04s]  I genuinely think this is impossible.
[502.04s -> 503.90s]  Let's see if I can do it.
[504.46s -> 506.87s]  What do I get if I make it?
[506.87s -> 509.22s]  What do I get? What do I get if I make it?
[582.68s -> 585.96s]  It's this fucking stupid like soy pointing meme.
[586.52s -> 587.32s]  God damn it.
[589.56s -> 591.64s]  He does the like the point thing.
[593.02s -> 594.30s]  God fucking damn it.
[594.30s -> 594.70s]  Really?
[605.24s -> 606.92s]  Unbelievable.
[606.92s -> 608.44s]  Un-fucking-believable.
[608.44s -> 611.37s]  I can't believe it, man.
[611.37s -> 611.77s]  Whatever.
[611.77s -> 613.61s]  Okay, I'm going to try from here.
[613.61s -> 638.92s]  I just spit all over this microphone right here.
[638.92s -> 642.20s]  Once Macho Man's shows up, it's over because I know he will.
[642.76s -> 650.62s]  Macho Man's is the best without a doubt.
[653.69s -> 679.59s]  I think I'm good.
[679.67s -> 679.99s]  I'm good.
[679.99s -> 680.23s]  I'm good.
[680.23s -> 680.55s]  I'm good.
[680.55s -> 680.95s]  I'm good.
[680.95s -> 681.51s]  Help them.
[681.51s -> 681.99s]  Help them.
[682.87s -> 693.99s]  The same guy?
[732.26s -> 740.54s]  Banjo-Kazooie character.
[740.54s -> 743.66s]  Like a bellows with eyes on it.
[743.66s -> 744.30s]  You know what I mean?
[752.50s -> 753.46s]  Logan Paul?
[757.30s -> 757.54s]  What?
[762.26s -> 765.22s]  It does.
[765.22s -> 765.94s]  No, it does.
[765.94s -> 766.34s]  Does it?
[775.24s -> 776.76s]  Him in the back with like the thing.
[784.90s -> 786.58s]  Older Logan Paul.
[786.58s -> 786.90s]  Wow.
[787.94s -> 788.66s]  That's insane.
[790.07s -> 791.91s]  All right, I'm going to play the one that...
[792.63s -> 794.47s]  I'm going to move on in a second, I promise.
[794.47s -> 799.18s]  Let me get this one real quick.
[799.74s -> 804.28s]  This one's short, I promise.
[822.33s -> 822.89s]  Where is he?
[823.53s -> 826.30s]  There it is.
[830.18s -> 855.83s]  Why is there Superman in this?
[862.95s -> 865.83s]  Oh, for a second, I thought Superman was going to be like...
[868.15s -> 870.31s]  I thought they were going to do it with the Superman movie.
[870.31s -> 871.03s]  I was like, what?
[873.03s -> 874.31s]  I was like, no, they're not.
[878.15s -> 878.47s]  Ready?
[892.04s -> 893.72s]  What the fuck is this video?
[894.84s -> 906.07s]  Yeah.
[922.66s -> 923.54s]  Okay, I've had enough.
[925.54s -> 926.66s]  I can't do it anymore.
[927.62s -> 930.34s]  I wonder if somebody did that with my stream.
[932.82s -> 934.50s]  What would that sound like?
[934.50s -> 945.53s]  Would it be as fucked up?
[945.53s -> 946.33s]  It would be worse.
[946.89s -> 948.33s]  I'm trying to think of how I talk.
[948.33s -> 949.82s]  Like, hey, what's going on?
[949.82s -> 950.78s]  I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.
[950.78s -> 951.98s]  I made a nice living in real estate,
[951.98s -> 953.34s]  but it's time for a new business plan.
[954.39s -> 954.87s]  I do it.
[958.02s -> 959.62s]  Now I'm going to think about that a lot.
[959.62s -> 967.11s]  Okay, we have to play a game.
[967.11s -> 969.00s]  Okay, so let's get to work.
[970.20s -> 972.84s]  Buenos Dias, I've sailed the world as a ship captain for years
[972.84s -> 973.88s]  and I can't even swim.
[973.88s -> 977.24s]  I don't want to worry about drowning anymore unless it's in money.
[978.04s -> 980.04s]  Let me assign you to your own piece of land.
[980.04s -> 981.08s]  The first one is on the house.
[982.04s -> 983.74s]  Oh, is this a risk?
[990.82s -> 992.82s]  Good day to celebrate the opening of my brand new bank.
[992.82s -> 994.42s]  I've opened an account for each of you.
[1001.21s -> 1002.65s]  If you need to borrow extra cash
[1002.65s -> 1004.89s]  or come by to view a financial report of your last venture.
[1005.69s -> 1010.26s]  Okay, so this is me, right?
[1010.90s -> 1014.52s]  Let's get that oil.
[1014.52s -> 1017.32s]  We're taking $2,000 with us to cover the start costs.
[1017.32s -> 1018.20s]  Are you ready to go?
[1019.00s -> 1021.43s]  All right, let's do it.
[1021.43s -> 1022.39s]  I need dowsers.
[1027.22s -> 1027.72s]  Got something?
[1030.39s -> 1034.20s]  Got something?
[1035.08s -> 1038.22s]  Let's go.
[1038.22s -> 1043.77s]  How far down should I go?
[1043.77s -> 1056.23s]  Should I go?
[1056.31s -> 1057.59s]  Wait, what did I do?
[1058.47s -> 1059.77s]  Did I screw this up?
[1060.41s -> 1069.85s]  What just happened?
[1095.14s -> 1096.02s]  How do I have no money?
[1096.66s -> 1110.58s]  I have 20 grand.
[1111.14s -> 1125.54s]  When did I spend $914?
[1146.62s -> 1147.50s]  I have to...
[1148.14s -> 1153.48s]  Okay, wait.
[1154.04s -> 1157.02s]  I found a way to increase the capacity of pipes.
[1157.02s -> 1158.14s]  Highly recommended.
[1158.14s -> 1160.46s]  Okay, so I have to find that shit.
[1160.46s -> 1165.24s]  All right, no, get out of here.
[1165.24s -> 1166.84s]  I'm not gonna spend seven grand right now.
[1167.56s -> 1170.89s]  I have a piece of land at the town hall.
[1171.61s -> 1173.00s]  Oh yes, I was expecting you.
[1173.00s -> 1174.04s]  What can I do for you?
[1174.04s -> 1174.76s]  Land auction.
[1174.76s -> 1177.56s]  Let's gather all the tenants together to auction.
[1178.28s -> 1179.22s]  Okay, let's go.
[1181.19s -> 1184.31s]  In turns, you decide which plot of land you get to mine next year.
[1184.87s -> 1186.81s]  On your turn, click on a parcel to bid on it.
[1186.81s -> 1188.89s]  You can outbid others by clicking on their parcels.
[1189.53s -> 1191.67s]  The numbers on the plots that have been mined,
[1192.23s -> 1195.24s]  they indicate how much oil was in that plot.
[1197.26s -> 1204.04s]  Okay, so there's probably oil here and here.
[1204.04s -> 1204.76s]  I'm gonna say here.
[1205.56s -> 1207.27s]  I'm going here.
[1207.83s -> 1214.15s]  That's it, right?
[1214.71s -> 1217.12s]  Okay.
[1218.56s -> 1220.64s]  Yeah, all you got no money left.
[1220.64s -> 1223.53s]  I got 17k left.
[1224.09s -> 1234.11s]  I'm gonna buy the width.
[1234.11s -> 1238.81s]  I feel like everybody else did that too.
[1240.38s -> 1242.46s]  All right, I understand how it works now, I think.
[1243.53s -> 1246.01s]  So to upgrade pipes capacity, just click on it.
[1246.65s -> 1256.40s]  Price is always right at right inc.
[1257.04s -> 1261.77s]  I mean, it is more, it is better.
[1263.05s -> 1264.65s]  I don't know, buy one cent though.
[1264.65s -> 1265.29s]  I don't really care.
[1266.09s -> 1276.62s]  All right, so where would it be?
[1276.62s -> 1277.50s]  Where should I dig?
[1279.88s -> 1281.16s]  Left and right Twix.
[1282.81s -> 1289.24s]  You got some?
[1290.20s -> 1311.66s]  Why would you make me do that for money?
[1341.96s -> 1354.75s]  Fuck!
[1354.75s -> 1355.31s]  Stop!
[1355.31s -> 1358.86s]  What do I do?
[1358.86s -> 1359.74s]  How do I stop?
[1359.74s -> 1360.14s]  Stop!
[1360.14s -> 1360.46s]  Stop!
[1360.46s -> 1360.62s]  Stop!
[1360.62s -> 1361.66s]  How do I stop the thing from going?
[1362.72s -> 1364.00s]  Did I not hit oil?
[1364.00s -> 1364.96s]  Oh, thank God I did.
[1364.96s -> 1385.80s]  All right, deliver.
[1386.67s -> 1387.63s]  85 cents go that way.
[1387.63s -> 1388.51s]  How do I do this?
[1388.51s -> 1391.71s]  How do I deliver?
[1391.71s -> 1392.99s]  How do I deliver to that way?
[1392.99s -> 1395.02s]  How do I, where?
[1395.02s -> 1395.98s]  Click the arrow, up arrow?
[1398.83s -> 1399.95s]  90 cents over there, let's go.
[1405.69s -> 1408.33s]  92 cents of gallon or whatever the hell it is.
[1408.33s -> 1416.30s]  What do I do about this?
[1416.30s -> 1418.38s]  What the fuck is happening, dude?
[1418.38s -> 1420.78s]  I just spent all that money on like a second drill.
[1422.48s -> 1424.56s]  I don't, I don't, I didn't mean to do that.
[1425.12s -> 1428.11s]  Should I do it over here?
[1428.83s -> 1453.36s]  Stop going that way.
[1453.36s -> 1454.32s]  Stop this way.
[1454.32s -> 1477.08s]  What does this swimming pool do?
[1477.80s -> 1482.43s]  Okay, how can I go down?
[1482.43s -> 1483.39s]  Branch limit reach.
[1483.39s -> 1484.59s]  Can I delete this?
[1484.59s -> 1505.87s]  Does that mean it's going to explode or something?
[1505.87s -> 1533.13s]  Stop the quad.
[1554.70s -> 1559.10s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[1559.10s -> 1560.76s]  I'm ready to go this way.
[1560.76s -> 1563.64s]  I got 2,500.
[1563.64s -> 1592.08s]  Oil is limited.
[1592.08s -> 1594.08s]  Yeah, well, there's probably plenty over here.
[1594.08s -> 1598.32s]  There's probably a shitload over here.
[1598.32s -> 1611.64s]  This is filling up.
[1614.75s -> 1615.95s]  That's for a year, right?
[1615.95s -> 1616.75s]  I got plenty of time.
[1627.88s -> 1630.32s]  Yeah, yeah, the one.
[1630.32s -> 1633.82s]  Yes, dude.
[1633.82s -> 1639.12s]  What are you talking about?
[1652.49s -> 1658.16s]  What the fuck just happened?
[1658.16s -> 1659.04s]  You're spilling oil.
[1659.04s -> 1660.80s]  Fix it by buying new wagons
[1660.80s -> 1663.52s]  or by reducing the number of wagons selling oil.
[1663.52s -> 1669.82s]  What do you mean reduce the number of wagons
[1669.82s -> 1671.02s]  when I want more wagons?
[1674.49s -> 1675.53s]  It's flown into here too.
[1675.53s -> 1678.01s]  I have three things that just don't work.
[1678.01s -> 1716.32s]  What does this do then?
[1716.32s -> 1717.84s]  I thought this was going to take the overflow.
[1718.88s -> 1724.97s]  Oh, they take from the overflow.
[1727.93s -> 1729.29s]  I thought this was going to spill into here.
[1730.49s -> 1739.58s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[1739.58s -> 1740.22s]  Fill it up, fill it up.
[1740.22s -> 1740.94s]  Take all the oil.
[1740.94s -> 1741.34s]  Take it all.
[1742.06s -> 1751.72s]  The buck 12 right now.
[1751.72s -> 1753.00s]  Get rid of all of it.
[1753.00s -> 1754.20s]  No, don't store it.
[1754.20s -> 1755.48s]  Why are you storing it?
[1756.12s -> 1757.40s]  Go sell it that way.
[1758.44s -> 1759.48s]  Sell the oil.
[1759.48s -> 1760.44s]  Why you don't?
[1760.44s -> 1762.44s]  No, pick up the oil and sell it over here.
[1763.88s -> 1776.81s]  I got 6K.
[1776.81s -> 1777.37s]  I'm all right.
[1777.37s -> 1780.52s]  2,500 in profit.
[1780.52s -> 1781.24s]  I'm all right.
[1781.24s -> 1787.02s]  Paid more than this fucking moron.
[1792.17s -> 1793.21s]  What the hell did she do?
[1799.23s -> 1800.27s]  Okay, nice to meet you.
[1800.27s -> 1801.95s]  I'm Edward and I'm a bit of a handyman.
[1801.95s -> 1803.15s]  I like to experiment with stuff
[1803.15s -> 1804.75s]  that can help you find oil.
[1804.75s -> 1806.35s]  Make sure to check out my inventions.
[1807.07s -> 1810.32s]  Okay.
[1812.70s -> 1815.90s]  I improved the dowsing rod so dowsers can search deeper.
[1820.44s -> 1821.80s]  Tired of dowsers taking forever?
[1822.44s -> 1825.31s]  Would you like to have this lovely mole?
[1825.31s -> 1827.55s]  He'll dig for you, but he's kind of erratic.
[1830.70s -> 1832.22s]  Yeah, of course I want the mole.
[1832.22s -> 1834.00s]  I'm broke now.
[1834.00s -> 1834.72s]  I have no money.
[1834.72s -> 1835.28s]  I'm in trouble.
[1835.84s -> 1862.36s]  Going up here.
[1864.72s -> 1866.83s]  That's what I just bid on.
[1867.63s -> 1869.72s]  How much is this for?
[1869.72s -> 1870.52s]  3,000?
[1878.17s -> 1878.89s]  Oh my God.
[1880.80s -> 1881.68s]  He has a dumb.
[1882.32s -> 1884.92s]  Okay, I got five grand.
[1887.48s -> 1890.22s]  You have cash to pay back William
[1890.22s -> 1892.46s]  before your current loan becomes final.
[1892.46s -> 1899.10s]  You want me to go pay the guy back $5,000
[1899.10s -> 1900.94s]  that just gave me $5,000
[1900.94s -> 1902.86s]  and be left with $142 left.
[1903.74s -> 1904.68s]  How would I do that?
[1906.96s -> 1907.28s]  Okay.
[1908.08s -> 1909.42s]  I have a mole now.
[1910.40s -> 1910.96s]  Mole.
[1910.96s -> 1912.24s]  Look, somewhere in the ground,
[1912.24s -> 1913.52s]  the mole will uncover this spot
[1914.24s -> 1916.64s]  and then dig around to uncover five more random spots.
[1917.36s -> 1918.56s]  Okay, right here.
[1920.14s -> 1921.02s]  Let's see if this is worth it.
[1922.22s -> 1922.54s]  Worth it?
[1955.60s -> 1956.24s]  Oh, hi.
[1956.24s -> 1956.48s]  Yeah.
[1957.36s -> 1958.08s]  Yes, sure.
[1960.65s -> 1960.97s]  Okay.
[1961.85s -> 1963.37s]  Very important that I get this right.
[1963.93s -> 1966.35s]  I'm going to say right here.
[1970.35s -> 1970.83s]  Right here.
[1981.44s -> 1981.84s]  Perfect.
[1982.32s -> 1982.72s]  Perfect.
[1986.16s -> 1988.56s]  Let's increase the fucking width on this thing, please.
[1989.36s -> 2001.23s]  Extend, extend it.
[2001.23s -> 2001.47s]  How?
[2002.19s -> 2004.49s]  I don't know how to do that.
[2004.49s -> 2004.81s]  Open it.
[2005.53s -> 2007.08s]  What do I do?
[2010.20s -> 2012.52s]  The mole got eaten by an alligator or something.
[2012.52s -> 2013.72s]  He's not doing anything anymore.
[2013.72s -> 2014.20s]  What happened?
[2015.50s -> 2016.46s]  Why is the mole gone?
[2016.46s -> 2017.18s]  Is the mole dead?
[2018.27s -> 2019.15s]  Hold the end of it.
[2022.35s -> 2023.39s]  Oh, shit.
[2023.39s -> 2023.71s]  Okay.
[2027.36s -> 2028.80s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[2029.76s -> 2039.55s]  I have no money.
[2059.64s -> 2060.68s]  Oh, I get it.
[2060.68s -> 2060.92s]  Okay.
[2062.04s -> 2068.94s]  Come on, dig something.
[2077.07s -> 2077.39s]  Shit.
[2080.56s -> 2082.16s]  Have one horse never sell.
[2082.88s -> 2088.75s]  Why?
[2089.31s -> 2107.92s]  So it just stores it.
[2107.92s -> 2108.24s]  Really?
[2116.73s -> 2118.09s]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[2118.09s -> 2121.85s]  So it just goes like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2121.85s -> 2123.05s]  Where is the oil in this map?
[2123.93s -> 2125.37s]  How much did I pay for this?
[2130.56s -> 2131.04s]  Finally.
[2131.04s -> 2131.28s]  All right.
[2131.28s -> 2132.32s]  We got double oil now.
[2156.80s -> 2157.92s]  Uh-oh, this is almost gone.
[2158.56s -> 2169.92s]  What happens if this bullet fills up?
[2169.92s -> 2170.56s]  Does this overflow?
[2173.93s -> 2174.73s]  It probably doesn't, right?
[2175.45s -> 2194.04s]  Why do you do that many horses?
[2194.04s -> 2194.84s]  Because they're not going to be...
[2194.84s -> 2196.04s]  I need to sell this oil.
[2196.04s -> 2201.85s]  And they are not doing it fast enough.
[2201.85s -> 2204.54s]  Okay, this is done, right?
[2204.54s -> 2205.02s]  So now what?
[2205.02s -> 2206.14s]  Just close this out?
[2206.78s -> 2209.08s]  Or is that it?
[2209.64s -> 2210.68s]  Should I douse?
[2210.68s -> 2225.13s]  All right, we got to get...
[2225.13s -> 2226.25s]  I got to get more horses.
[2226.25s -> 2227.85s]  I'm not going to be able to sell all of this.
[2227.85s -> 2231.84s]  I need to go deeper, deeper, deeper.
[2241.79s -> 2242.11s]  Shit.
[2242.11s -> 2242.91s]  Okay, that's right here.
[2253.64s -> 2255.24s]  Yeah, I found it before you did.
[2255.72s -> 2256.76s]  Why even use that person?
[2257.48s -> 2264.09s]  Can you fire horses?
[2264.09s -> 2264.81s]  Can I get rid of people?
[2265.37s -> 2293.13s]  All right.
[2293.13s -> 2295.37s]  Now we're going to get started loading oil up like crazy.
[2295.93s -> 2305.90s]  I need more.
[2305.90s -> 2306.78s]  I want more.
[2306.78s -> 2307.18s]  I need more.
[2307.90s -> 2323.93s]  All right.
[2323.93s -> 2325.53s]  We need somebody to store some oil.
[2325.53s -> 2329.55s]  Let's store it.
[2330.81s -> 2331.29s]  And then...
[2332.09s -> 2334.06s]  Oh, shit.
[2334.06s -> 2334.78s]  I can do double.
[2335.82s -> 2337.42s]  This guy not found oil yet?
[2338.14s -> 2340.28s]  This guy's been walking around for 10 minutes straight.
[2341.24s -> 2345.80s]  Oh, final month.
[2345.80s -> 2346.04s]  Okay.
[2351.12s -> 2351.84s]  Sell all.
[2351.84s -> 2352.64s]  Sell all.
[2352.64s -> 2352.88s]  How?
[2353.60s -> 2354.99s]  Can I sell the horses?
[2355.71s -> 2391.95s]  Okay, I'm going to pay the loan off.
[2392.03s -> 2392.51s]  Immediately.
[2393.23s -> 2395.76s]  It's too late to change to the left side.
[2395.76s -> 2396.56s]  Oh, right side I'm in.
[2398.27s -> 2400.11s]  Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell it.
[2407.50s -> 2407.98s]  Bullshit.
[2407.98s -> 2409.26s]  This is a lot of oil here.
[2409.26s -> 2412.14s]  It was literally two, three patches.
[2412.14s -> 2412.78s]  What?
[2412.78s -> 2416.32s]  Did I pay it off?
[2418.67s -> 2420.27s]  15,000 in earnings.
[2420.27s -> 2421.31s]  I spent five grand.
[2421.31s -> 2422.75s]  Banked at six.
[2422.75s -> 2424.19s]  I didn't pay the bank yet.
[2424.19s -> 2428.30s]  I didn't pay the bank yet.
[2429.02s -> 2434.76s]  Oh, I'm Rainer, the trainer.
[2434.76s -> 2437.08s]  I take care of the horses to keep them healthy and ready for work.
[2437.08s -> 2437.88s]  Drop by my stables.
[2437.88s -> 2438.84s]  Maybe we can help each other.
[2443.63s -> 2444.19s]  Did I?
[2444.19s -> 2444.43s]  Wait.
[2448.12s -> 2449.32s]  I paid it back already?
[2450.36s -> 2451.80s]  Why would it cover my debt right away?
[2451.80s -> 2453.16s]  What if I didn't want to do that right away?
[2453.72s -> 2460.97s]  You track up how many horses you have with this handy horse counter.
[2462.72s -> 2465.93s]  Is it worth $5,000 to know that I have six horses?
[2468.75s -> 2469.47s]  Okay, here we go.
[2469.47s -> 2471.48s]  Depth.
[2471.48s -> 2472.92s]  Dowsers can search deeper.
[2475.37s -> 2476.73s]  They find oil faster.
[2479.39s -> 2480.03s]  Size.
[2482.08s -> 2483.04s]  Oh, I like that.
[2483.60s -> 2484.64s]  I don't have enough money though.
[2485.28s -> 2492.20s]  I don't have enough.
[2492.20s -> 2498.92s]  Okay, let's go.
[2498.92s -> 2499.56s]  I'm going up.
[2500.81s -> 2501.45s]  Up top here.
[2502.09s -> 2509.31s]  I think people are sleeping on this one.
[2510.03s -> 2514.40s]  All right.
[2514.40s -> 2515.52s]  Now I'm ready.
[2516.80s -> 2517.76s]  I'm ready to rock and roll.
[2518.40s -> 2525.77s]  Let's get some profit here.
[2525.77s -> 2526.49s]  No more loans.
[2526.49s -> 2527.29s]  No more bullshit.
[2527.85s -> 2533.88s]  Go find me some oil so I can get started right away in January.
[2535.00s -> 2536.28s]  And get the silo down too.
[2536.28s -> 2536.76s]  Immediately.
[2536.76s -> 2537.24s]  Right in the middle.
[2538.20s -> 2538.44s]  Go.
[2538.44s -> 2538.84s]  I'm ready.
[2540.62s -> 2540.94s]  You know what?
[2540.94s -> 2541.82s]  Put a mole down here.
[2542.38s -> 2549.93s]  Make it snappy.
[2550.65s -> 2556.46s]  Oh, mole found oil.
[2556.46s -> 2557.42s]  Look at that.
[2557.42s -> 2568.88s]  I'm putting one here.
[2569.60s -> 2573.77s]  I got to strike something here.
[2575.23s -> 2575.79s]  Thank God.
[2575.79s -> 2576.03s]  All right.
[2576.99s -> 2578.03s]  Put it down a little bit more.
[2586.46s -> 2586.78s]  All right.
[2587.34s -> 2588.46s]  I'm ready to rock and roll.
[2590.46s -> 2591.26s]  I keep saying that.
[2591.26s -> 2592.22s]  I said that like five times.
[2592.86s -> 2600.88s]  I'm going to get the guaranteed one here.
[2607.69s -> 2608.89s]  Oh, shit.
[2608.89s -> 2609.69s]  Oh, shit.
[2609.69s -> 2610.33s]  Oh, shit.
[2610.33s -> 2610.97s]  Oh, shit.
[2610.97s -> 2611.53s]  Oh, shit.
[2611.53s -> 2612.49s]  Oh, shit.
[2612.49s -> 2612.97s]  Oh, shit.
[2613.53s -> 2614.09s]  Oh, shit.
[2614.09s -> 2614.49s]  Come on.
[2614.49s -> 2614.73s]  Come on.
[2614.73s -> 2615.05s]  Come on.
[2615.05s -> 2615.37s]  Come on.
[2615.37s -> 2615.61s]  Come on.
[2615.61s -> 2615.77s]  Come on.
[2615.77s -> 2616.41s]  Give me 150.
[2616.41s -> 2616.57s]  Come on.
[2616.57s -> 2616.73s]  Come on.
[2616.73s -> 2616.89s]  Come on.
[2616.89s -> 2616.97s]  Come on.
[2616.97s -> 2624.72s]  150, 150, 150, 150.
[2624.72s -> 2625.20s]  Dude.
[2625.92s -> 2626.48s]  Come on.
[2627.04s -> 2628.16s]  Just suck it up already.
[2628.88s -> 2629.36s]  Nobody.
[2629.84s -> 2631.20s]  Just deposit it for now.
[2632.08s -> 2632.64s]  Suck it up.
[2633.52s -> 2643.66s]  All right.
[2643.66s -> 2646.06s]  We're going left because I have to go left.
[2647.02s -> 2649.26s]  I don't care if I lose out on money.
[2649.26s -> 2651.34s]  It's the fastest way to sell so I can base more horses.
[2659.34s -> 2659.98s]  Holy shit.
[2659.98s -> 2661.18s]  This thing is flowing.
[2661.18s -> 2662.94s]  Look at how much this is just flowing.
[2673.28s -> 2673.52s]  All right.
[2673.52s -> 2674.56s]  I think we're in good shape.
[2674.56s -> 2675.92s]  I'm going to have two people sell.
[2677.34s -> 2679.02s]  Now we can start to really flow some money.
[2679.74s -> 2685.00s]  Here we go.
[2685.56s -> 2686.84s]  I'm getting the guaranteed one over here.
[2687.64s -> 2697.15s]  Expensive, but it should be all right.
[2713.74s -> 2714.22s]  Beautiful.
[2714.78s -> 2715.58s]  Nice job, mole.
[2722.19s -> 2722.91s]  Nice job, mole.
[2737.80s -> 2738.60s]  Breaking the dough.
[2745.61s -> 2745.93s]  Nice.
[2747.42s -> 2748.30s]  Good find.
[2748.30s -> 2748.86s]  Good find.
[2749.98s -> 2757.64s]  All right.
[2757.64s -> 2764.76s]  Start selling it.
[2764.76s -> 2767.40s]  I'm going to start to see a huge amount of flow here now.
[2767.40s -> 2772.00s]  This is going to get wacky.
[2772.00s -> 2772.80s]  I need more horses.
[2776.96s -> 2778.32s]  Prices are pretty much the same.
[2779.04s -> 2779.84s]  We'll do half and half.
[2782.44s -> 2783.32s]  Prices are pretty close.
[2787.12s -> 2787.60s]  Where is this?
[2801.32s -> 2801.72s]  Shit.
[2801.72s -> 2801.96s]  Yes.
[2818.59s -> 2819.07s]  All right.
[2819.07s -> 2819.79s]  Stop selling.
[2819.79s -> 2820.51s]  Stop selling.
[2820.51s -> 2822.51s]  It's dog shit prices.
[2822.51s -> 2823.39s]  Stop selling.
[2823.39s -> 2832.92s]  Dog shit prices.
[2832.92s -> 2833.88s]  Stop selling.
[2833.88s -> 2834.84s]  Prices are dog shit.
[2842.81s -> 2854.48s]  Uh-oh.
[2854.48s -> 2855.28s]  Jesus.
[2855.28s -> 2855.60s]  Okay.
[2855.60s -> 2856.00s]  Hold on.
[2856.64s -> 2858.56s]  Don't sell anything until it's at least a dollar.
[2873.15s -> 2887.98s]  You look green.
[2889.77s -> 2890.17s]  Gremlin.
[2890.17s -> 2892.32s]  That's fine.
[2892.32s -> 2893.44s]  Do I need more horses?
[2894.24s -> 2900.67s]  They're going to start taking from the reserves, right?
[2909.31s -> 2910.51s]  I need more horses, don't I?
[2912.89s -> 2913.45s]  They're not.
[2913.45s -> 2914.25s]  Look at these.
[2914.25s -> 2915.29s]  All these tanks are full.
[2915.85s -> 2919.69s]  This game is awesome.
[2919.69s -> 2920.41s]  I love it.
[2920.41s -> 2921.45s]  I knew I was going to get stuck.
[2922.25s -> 2937.21s]  The prices are crazy right now.
[2937.21s -> 2937.69s]  Come on.
[2937.69s -> 2938.25s]  Final month.
[2938.25s -> 2940.62s]  Everybody get over there now.
[2940.62s -> 2941.74s]  No more drilling.
[2941.74s -> 2942.62s]  And yeah, no more drilling.
[2942.62s -> 2943.02s]  Just sell.
[2944.91s -> 2947.63s]  Everybody just dump all your load over here.
[2952.43s -> 2953.55s]  More horses?
[2953.55s -> 2961.36s]  Put this down.
[2961.36s -> 2963.58s]  Hurry up.
[2963.58s -> 2964.86s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[2964.86s -> 2985.95s]  Only like 10 days.
[2986.75s -> 3011.15s]  $12,836.
[3011.15s -> 3012.19s]  That's how we get it done.
[3018.19s -> 3019.55s]  Oh, I lost 50 cents.
[3019.55s -> 3019.71s]  All right.
[3019.71s -> 3020.99s]  I got $1,000 in fines.
[3020.99s -> 3021.47s]  Who cares?
[3022.19s -> 3024.40s]  10 grand.
[3025.28s -> 3027.02s]  Did anybody?
[3027.02s -> 3028.38s]  No one even came close.
[3028.38s -> 3030.14s]  I should get a prize for that.
[3030.86s -> 3033.44s]  Welcome to my bar.
[3033.44s -> 3034.96s]  Make yourself comfortable and mingle with the crowd.
[3034.96s -> 3036.32s]  They may have some interesting offers.
[3038.48s -> 3039.44s]  I like this game a lot.
[3041.05s -> 3041.37s]  Okay.
[3044.67s -> 3045.07s]  Kyle.
[3046.00s -> 3047.20s]  Tired of low prices.
[3047.20s -> 3051.84s]  Slip me some cash and the price of left ink will never go below 70 cents next year.
[3052.48s -> 3057.98s]  Okay.
[3057.98s -> 3061.64s]  At right ink, the price can be even more right.
[3061.64s -> 3066.40s]  For a small personal donation, a price will stay above 81 cents for the year.
[3066.40s -> 3067.44s]  That's not bad.
[3067.44s -> 3077.12s]  I can offer you a 50% discount on those hefty spilling fines for one year.
[3078.75s -> 3078.99s]  No.
[3078.99s -> 3079.79s]  How much is a fine?
[3081.76s -> 3084.24s]  I spilled 10 times or so and that's not worth it.
[3084.24s -> 3084.56s]  No.
[3084.56s -> 3087.05s]  Get out of here.
[3087.05s -> 3087.85s]  Although you can just...
[3088.41s -> 3091.76s]  Although you can fuck off.
[3091.76s -> 3092.08s]  All right.
[3096.54s -> 3099.18s]  More with three.
[3101.05s -> 3102.81s]  Double capacity.
[3105.47s -> 3106.27s]  I can have two.
[3109.92s -> 3111.20s]  Yeah, this is it for sure.
[3112.72s -> 3113.28s]  Yep.
[3113.28s -> 3116.14s]  This is it.
[3116.14s -> 3118.76s]  I won't have that much money left though.
[3119.40s -> 3122.51s]  I think I'm going to do size two.
[3126.46s -> 3127.82s]  Size two makes sense to me.
[3127.82s -> 3138.25s]  I'm going up here.
[3141.88s -> 3143.56s]  Why do I get to go last every year?
[3144.20s -> 3145.00s]  That doesn't seem fair.
[3145.72s -> 3147.47s]  I have to go last every year?
[3148.27s -> 3153.13s]  I'm not bidding more money for that.
[3162.30s -> 3163.58s]  Upgrade the mole?
[3163.98s -> 3164.86s]  How do I upgrade the mole?
[3166.06s -> 3170.41s]  There's no mole two.
[3170.41s -> 3170.73s]  Is there?
[3173.45s -> 3174.41s]  I don't think there's a mole two.
[3175.13s -> 3178.32s]  All right.
[3178.32s -> 3178.64s]  Let's go.
[3179.44s -> 3180.40s]  I'm ready.
[3180.40s -> 3185.98s]  Click the button above the silo to upgrade the storage capacity of your silo against a small cost.
[3185.98s -> 3186.30s]  Okay.
[3188.03s -> 3192.75s]  From now on, levels will run from January 1st to December 31st.
[3192.75s -> 3194.75s]  I think there's no more oil left in the ground.
[3194.75s -> 3197.47s]  Click on the calendar and withdraw your land lease.
[3199.48s -> 3204.19s]  Oh, so if I don't...
[3204.19s -> 3205.79s]  If I go to the last month and I don't...
[3205.79s -> 3206.91s]  Well, there's nothing left?
[3208.03s -> 3209.15s]  I get some of the money back.
[3209.95s -> 3210.27s]  All right.
[3210.27s -> 3211.15s]  Let's go for it.
[3211.15s -> 3211.71s]  What do you want?
[3213.20s -> 3214.96s]  Oh, there's a Sims fast forward button.
[3215.76s -> 3217.29s]  Okay.
[3217.29s -> 3217.53s]  Cool.
[3219.42s -> 3226.44s]  Get this started right.
[3226.44s -> 3242.75s]  Is that oil right there?
[3243.39s -> 3244.32s]  I can't tell.
[3244.32s -> 3244.80s]  Is that oil?
[3246.97s -> 3248.09s]  That looks like the edge, right?
[3248.81s -> 3250.80s]  Is that an edge?
[3260.41s -> 3260.65s]  Yes.
[3261.61s -> 3261.93s]  Right there.
[3261.93s -> 3262.17s]  All right.
[3262.17s -> 3262.41s]  We're good.
[3262.41s -> 3262.73s]  We're good.
[3262.73s -> 3263.29s]  Good start.
[3263.29s -> 3263.77s]  Good start.
[3275.92s -> 3276.72s]  Whoa!
[3276.72s -> 3277.28s]  Slippage.
[3280.38s -> 3281.34s]  Not slippage.
[3281.34s -> 3281.90s]  Spillage.
[3289.24s -> 3290.12s]  Oh, over here.
[3290.12s -> 3291.40s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3291.40s -> 3291.80s]  This way.
[3299.77s -> 3326.32s]  Okay.
[3326.32s -> 3326.56s]  No.
[3326.56s -> 3326.80s]  Yeah.
[3326.80s -> 3328.57s]  This is expensive as shit.
[3328.57s -> 3351.71s]  Bring it over here.
[3351.71s -> 3351.95s]  Yeah.
[3351.95s -> 3352.43s]  No shit.
[3352.43s -> 3353.39s]  There's oil there.
[3353.39s -> 3358.30s]  All right.
[3358.30s -> 3360.06s]  I'm going to bring it back here.
[3360.06s -> 3360.30s]  Okay.
[3361.80s -> 3363.16s]  Start depositing it.
[3363.16s -> 3363.40s]  All right.
[3363.40s -> 3364.04s]  Stop bringing it right.
[3364.68s -> 3378.19s]  Okay.
[3378.19s -> 3380.25s]  How is there nothing over here?
[3380.25s -> 3382.25s]  I'm thinking this game sucks.
[3382.25s -> 3382.89s]  Play something else.
[3382.89s -> 3383.45s]  No way, man.
[3383.45s -> 3383.93s]  This is great.
[3384.49s -> 3387.40s]  This game is no way, man.
[3387.40s -> 3387.72s]  Come on.
[3387.72s -> 3388.28s]  This is fun.
[3389.42s -> 3390.30s]  I think this is great.
[3394.19s -> 3394.75s]  Oh, shit.
[3394.75s -> 3394.99s]  All right.
[3394.99s -> 3395.31s]  We're good.
[3400.60s -> 3401.00s]  All right.
[3401.00s -> 3401.56s]  Hear me out.
[3401.56s -> 3402.84s]  I'm not going to go all the way down
[3403.95s -> 3406.03s]  because I'm afraid I'm going to go through something
[3406.03s -> 3406.75s]  and screw it up.
[3420.11s -> 3421.07s]  No, nothing there.
[3421.63s -> 3424.72s]  Is this still sucking from there?
[3425.96s -> 3427.40s]  Is it still getting it from there?
[3448.41s -> 3449.85s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3449.85s -> 3450.89s]  Store it, store it, store it.
[3450.89s -> 3453.37s]  You do the big rush at the end when it's like $1.50.
[3453.37s -> 3478.65s]  The mole's down here.
[3478.65s -> 3479.05s]  All right.
[3479.05s -> 3481.74s]  Let's start selling a little bit.
[3481.74s -> 3486.36s]  78 cents a spine.
[3486.36s -> 3487.08s]  There we go.
[3487.08s -> 3488.76s]  Here we go.
[3488.76s -> 3489.32s]  Perfect.
[3489.32s -> 3514.57s]  All right.
[3514.57s -> 3515.61s]  Let's go sell.
[3515.61s -> 3520.51s]  I'm going to be taking a ton.
[3520.51s -> 3521.95s]  I'm going to be making a lot of oil now.
[3530.96s -> 3531.28s]  Sell.
[3534.25s -> 3534.89s]  More horses.
[3534.89s -> 3535.29s]  I need more.
[3537.28s -> 3537.92s]  All right.
[3537.92s -> 3538.88s]  Let's go.
[3541.45s -> 3543.29s]  It's literally $1.02 right now.
[3543.29s -> 3543.85s]  Speed it up.
[3543.85s -> 3544.41s]  Suck it out.
[3554.70s -> 3555.10s]  All right.
[3555.10s -> 3555.82s]  I'm going to end.
[3555.82s -> 3557.58s]  I'm going to leave after this.
[3557.58s -> 3560.14s]  We just drained the whole thing.
[3560.14s -> 3560.38s]  All right.
[3560.38s -> 3561.18s]  I got $22,000.
[3561.98s -> 3563.21s]  Watch this.
[3563.77s -> 3565.50s]  I'm out.
[3565.50s -> 3565.82s]  I'm out.
[3565.82s -> 3566.54s]  I'm going to get a refund.
[3568.06s -> 3568.94s]  Upgrade the pipe.
[3568.94s -> 3569.34s]  Wait, what?
[3570.06s -> 3571.96s]  Wait, it's only August.
[3571.96s -> 3573.16s]  September, October, November.
[3573.16s -> 3573.72s]  It's not.
[3573.72s -> 3574.04s]  Okay.
[3574.04s -> 3574.44s]  Hold on.
[3575.00s -> 3578.01s]  There's no more juice on the ground, guys.
[3578.65s -> 3580.84s]  Is there some?
[3580.84s -> 3581.48s]  Wait, there's some here.
[3582.28s -> 3585.74s]  A little bit of extra at the bottom of the thing here.
[3586.46s -> 3608.46s]  I'm out.
[3608.46s -> 3622.40s]  I'm out.
[3622.40s -> 3626.75s]  I'm out.
[3626.75s -> 3632.04s]  Good call.
[3632.04s -> 3633.63s]  It was a good call.
[3635.39s -> 3636.67s]  I just, there was one more over here.
[3636.67s -> 3636.99s]  That's fine.
[3636.99s -> 3637.55s]  It's a good call.
[3637.55s -> 3639.63s]  I got my, I got literally, I got my money back.
[3639.63s -> 3639.95s]  Look at this.
[3639.95s -> 3643.32s]  Look at that.
[3643.32s -> 3644.84s]  It's literally 50% off.
[3645.40s -> 3646.28s]  It was a big one.
[3646.28s -> 3648.44s]  It was, it was decent medium size.
[3648.44s -> 3656.33s]  It was okay.
[3656.33s -> 3659.98s]  Okay.
[3659.98s -> 3660.78s]  Mayor's tips.
[3663.47s -> 3664.35s]  That's a big deal.
[3666.78s -> 3668.46s]  Four grand to make it so it's,
[3668.46s -> 3671.18s]  left ankle only be always 91 cents.
[3673.34s -> 3675.26s]  I'm going to build everything over on the left side.
[3675.90s -> 3679.85s]  Nothing's even going to go close to the right side.
[3680.89s -> 3683.82s]  Oh, that's not bad.
[3684.54s -> 3687.63s]  400 bucks for the slippage.
[3687.63s -> 3689.39s]  Why do I keep saying slippage?
[3689.39s -> 3692.68s]  Does the lower interest sound interesting?
[3692.68s -> 3696.20s]  Pay me some cash and I'll reduce next year's interest rates by 42%.
[3697.32s -> 3698.72s]  I got 30.
[3699.28s -> 3699.60s]  Geez.
[3700.40s -> 3700.80s]  I'm fine.
[3700.80s -> 3701.76s]  I'm going to do this one though.
[3702.40s -> 3705.39s]  91 cents permanently on the left side.
[3706.03s -> 3708.54s]  I think that's a good deal.
[3709.18s -> 3712.72s]  Mayor's tips.
[3723.23s -> 3725.31s]  One of 20 Daphne's deals.
[3725.87s -> 3729.23s]  Pipes don't have to reach the bottom of an oil patch.
[3729.23s -> 3730.83s]  Once connected, the oil pocket will be okay.
[3730.83s -> 3732.03s]  So that's good to know.
[3732.03s -> 3732.67s]  Thanks for the tip.
[3734.94s -> 3738.30s]  Oil is only pumped as fast as the narrowest pipe in a chain.
[3739.69s -> 3740.41s]  And handle.
[3740.41s -> 3743.53s]  Make sure all pipes in the chain are sufficiently upgraded for the most efficient oil flow.
[3744.49s -> 3747.36s]  Okay.
[3747.36s -> 3750.40s]  If you don't see oil in uncovered ground below a waving dowser,
[3750.40s -> 3752.56s]  wait a while for the ground level to rise more.
[3764.70s -> 3767.82s]  You get more money for getting all the oil or selling all the oil
[3767.82s -> 3770.30s]  and withdrawing your land lease early.
[3770.30s -> 3774.49s]  Thank you mayor.
[3774.49s -> 3775.05s]  Appreciate it.
[3779.85s -> 3780.65s]  What else do I want to do?
[3782.00s -> 3782.72s]  Size three.
[3783.36s -> 3784.00s]  Timer two.
[3788.91s -> 3789.47s]  Wide.
[3789.47s -> 3790.03s]  Free wide.
[3790.67s -> 3796.27s]  Or more horses.
[3797.34s -> 3798.38s]  Mole sells two.
[3798.38s -> 3799.02s]  I'm begging you.
[3808.09s -> 3808.81s]  Where?
[3808.81s -> 3810.49s]  Mole sells two.
[3810.49s -> 3812.76s]  What's the moles?
[3813.95s -> 3814.27s]  Oh.
[3816.64s -> 3817.68s]  10 grand though.
[3817.68s -> 3818.08s]  All right.
[3818.08s -> 3818.64s]  I'll do it.
[3818.64s -> 3821.20s]  That's like the most money I wanted to spend in this entire time.
[3822.81s -> 3823.93s]  Moles dig faster.
[3824.81s -> 3827.58s]  I want horses.
[3828.22s -> 3834.91s]  Why did I just?
[3835.63s -> 3843.68s]  I don't have enough money.
[3844.48s -> 3858.12s]  I want this one.
[3859.40s -> 3860.99s]  Really?
[3860.99s -> 3861.95s]  You're going to outbid me?
[3862.91s -> 3865.40s]  You piece of shit.
[3866.12s -> 3869.04s]  How much is it going for?
[3869.04s -> 3869.60s]  Four grand?
[3871.39s -> 3872.03s]  Get out of my way.
[3872.91s -> 3878.44s]  You don't even have that much money.
[3879.08s -> 3880.38s]  Oh yeah you do.
[3880.38s -> 3881.02s]  Whatever fine.
[3881.66s -> 3882.06s]  Who cares?
[3882.86s -> 3884.94s]  I'm going over here.
[3887.74s -> 3896.44s]  Let's go.
[3896.44s -> 3898.76s]  Moles will now uncover nine cells instead of six.
[3900.16s -> 3902.40s]  I think they're probably better than the dowsers at this point right?
[3903.36s -> 3906.33s]  Let's get four going.
[3910.88s -> 3911.68s]  Who needs a dowser?
[3913.28s -> 3914.40s]  Left side only.
[3918.43s -> 3919.87s]  This is a huge one too.
[3920.67s -> 3923.48s]  Oh my god.
[3924.12s -> 3931.45s]  What a start.
[3932.41s -> 3932.97s]  What a start.
[3933.85s -> 3952.64s]  Right side?
[3952.64s -> 3953.52s]  No no no no no.
[3953.52s -> 3954.24s]  I'm not doing that.
[3960.73s -> 3961.53s]  Yes.
[3969.00s -> 3969.24s]  No.
[3971.45s -> 3971.85s]  Right there.
[3972.41s -> 3998.44s]  There's nothing over here.
[4012.97s -> 4013.61s]  God damn it.
[4013.61s -> 4014.33s]  This is not enough.
[4014.33s -> 4015.61s]  Oh this is bad.
[4015.61s -> 4016.57s]  This is bad placement.
[4016.57s -> 4017.05s]  But whatever.
[4017.05s -> 4017.53s]  It's all right.
[4018.09s -> 4071.20s]  There's no oil on the on this side.
[4071.20s -> 4092.27s]  All right we're in a good spot.
[4092.27s -> 4097.72s]  Speed it up.
[4104.38s -> 4105.10s]  Excuse me.
[4105.10s -> 4105.42s]  Take it.
[4105.42s -> 4106.30s]  Don't take it.
[4106.30s -> 4106.46s]  Go.
[4106.46s -> 4107.66s]  What are you doing over there?
[4108.54s -> 4127.00s]  Look at that.
[4127.00s -> 4128.70s]  Look at that money coming in.
[4128.70s -> 4145.45s]  30 grand.
[4145.45s -> 4146.81s]  Oh let's go.
[4146.81s -> 4166.27s]  All right I need down here.
[4166.27s -> 4191.47s]  See where you see something.
[4192.03s -> 4192.43s]  What do you see?
[4192.43s -> 4193.15s]  You see something?
[4193.15s -> 4227.08s]  A dollar thirty nine.

[4228.84s -> 4230.04s]  I need to make more money.
[4230.04s -> 4233.39s]  A dollar fifty per pound or whatever it is.
[4233.39s -> 4242.80s]  Come on.
[4242.80s -> 4243.92s]  This is so much.
[4243.92s -> 4248.56s]  Is there no more oil left in this goddamn place?
[4248.56s -> 4261.71s]  I think this place is dry.
[4261.71s -> 4268.72s]  I think it's dry.
[4268.72s -> 4270.52s]  I think I got everything.
[4270.52s -> 4270.92s]  It's dry.
[4271.56s -> 4275.18s]  Let me check one a few more places.
[4275.90s -> 4281.39s]  I think it's dry.
[4282.03s -> 4292.84s]  I'm pulling up.
[4292.84s -> 4298.60s]  Got it all.
[4298.60s -> 4302.03s]  Thousand for bonus early withdrawal.
[4302.03s -> 4303.15s]  Thousand for all oil.
[4303.15s -> 4305.48s]  Thousand for all oil sold.
[4305.48s -> 4306.20s]  Bingo.
[4306.20s -> 4310.22s]  Did it.
[4310.22s -> 4315.50s]  Feels good.
[4316.14s -> 4319.32s]  Okay.
[4319.32s -> 4321.26s]  I got money to play with now.
[4321.26s -> 4324.62s]  What should I do?
[4325.34s -> 4329.53s]  I think it's stable right?
[4332.81s -> 4336.01s]  Yeah so I can buy less horses makes sense to me.
[4336.01s -> 4338.59s]  So the horses can just take more.
[4340.67s -> 4341.95s]  And I want them to be faster.
[4342.91s -> 4346.96s]  That's twenty five thousand dollars.
[4346.96s -> 4347.28s]  I'm done.
[4353.08s -> 4357.96s]  Left is eighty nine ninety cents or I I don't get out of bed for anything less than ninety cents.
[4358.84s -> 4367.02s]  Sorry not worth it.
[4367.02s -> 4372.92s]  Okay let's keep going.
[4378.44s -> 4379.24s]  Thirty four.
[4379.24s -> 4379.96s]  That's not bad.
[4379.96s -> 4381.40s]  You know to fight all the people over here.
[4382.76s -> 4392.25s]  It looks like the trend is up here is more.
[4392.89s -> 4394.68s]  Let's go higher.
[4395.48s -> 4398.48s]  The higher you go seems like the more there is.
[4399.36s -> 4403.56s]  The green on this guy is crazy.
[4403.56s -> 4404.20s]  I'm green?
[4404.84s -> 4407.71s]  Am I actually like green?
[4407.71s -> 4408.67s]  Like my skin is green?
[4409.31s -> 4410.11s]  What do you mean?
[4410.11s -> 4410.43s]  Is it?
[4416.08s -> 4416.48s]  Shouldn't be.
[4421.23s -> 4422.35s]  All right let's move.
[4422.35s -> 4427.40s]  From now on you can upgrade your wagons to carry more oil.
[4427.40s -> 4428.76s]  You can buy it by clicking it here.
[4429.32s -> 4431.72s]  Remember this upgrade only lasts for the duration of the level.
[4432.91s -> 4434.27s]  Oh okay well.

[4492.28s -> 4516.68s]  Well now I'm kind of hold on.

[4585.64s -> 4591.61s]  All right do not go that way.
[4591.61s -> 4593.40s]  Don't go that way either.
[4593.40s -> 4612.60s]  39 cents give me a break.
[4612.60s -> 4648.96s]  Right when I send all of you guys over here.

[4700.68s -> 4702.20s]  Oh my god it's all a 37.

[4840.36s -> 4844.09s]  Moles will now uncover 12 cells instead of nine.
[4844.09s -> 4848.25s]  It's 20 grand.
[4848.25s -> 4849.85s]  Moles will dig faster.
[4849.85s -> 4853.13s]  I just spent 30 000 on moles.
[4853.13s -> 4857.13s]  They dig faster and they do way more.
[4857.13s -> 4859.16s]  Hope this is worth it.
[4859.16s -> 4860.84s]  I only have six thousand dollars left.

[5014.78s -> 5017.07s]  I'll get it don't worry.
[5017.07s -> 5018.51s]  Nothing on the right side at all.

[5106.67s -> 5109.76s]  What do I do about this?
[5109.76s -> 5112.92s]  There's too much money to be made on the right side.
[5112.92s -> 5120.12s]  I can't store it yet.
[5120.12s -> 5121.08s]  What the hell?
[5121.08s -> 5125.53s]  Can I close this?
[5125.53s -> 5126.65s]  Close one rig.
[5126.65s -> 5136.19s]  What do I?
[5136.19s -> 5148.68s]  How do I do this?
[5148.68s -> 5150.06s]  You can't.
[5150.06s -> 5150.86s]  I can't.
[5150.86s -> 5151.58s]  I guess you can't.
[5152.22s -> 5159.20s]  Oh really?
[5159.20s -> 5165.28s]  Oh I think I'm all right.
[5165.28s -> 5166.08s]  I'm okay.
[5166.08s -> 5169.08s]  Let's start storing oil.
[5169.08s -> 5177.21s]  I think I'm all right.

[5202.19s -> 5203.47s]  It's not my problem.
[5203.47s -> 5204.91s]  This land is terrible.
[5204.91s -> 5206.91s]  I got the worst land in the game so far.
[5206.91s -> 5230.44s]  You're gonna think I'm insane but I'm not.
[5230.44s -> 5250.41s]  All right store it.
[5250.41s -> 5251.77s]  Bottom left too yep.

[5256.41s -> 5262.24s]  I'm gonna have to go from here that way.
[5262.24s -> 5269.63s]  It's so long but it's gonna be the same length.
[5269.63s -> 5270.43s]  Do not sell.
[5270.43s -> 5275.10s]  These are dog shit prices.
[5275.10s -> 5276.70s]  Don't sell these are dog shit prices.
[5276.70s -> 5277.50s]  I refuse.
[5277.50s -> 5293.18s]  Don't sell.
[5293.18s -> 5298.62s]  We're gonna do a huge sell at the end.
[5303.02s -> 5311.93s]  All right I'm gonna keep going this way.
[5311.93s -> 5313.13s]  63 cents.

[5345.64s -> 5346.52s]  89 cents.
[5346.52s -> 5348.49s]  Get the horses ready.
[5348.49s -> 5349.85s]  Get the horses ready.
[5349.85s -> 5356.96s]  Once this goes over a dollar I'm going in.
[5356.96s -> 5361.92s]  And it's time not yet.
[5361.92s -> 5396.03s]  Okay the run is saved.

[5431.08s -> 5432.12s]  Stop selling.
[5432.12s -> 5435.37s]  Store it.
[5435.37s -> 5447.93s]  I think that might be it.
[5448.51s -> 5453.82s]  Another couple of uh I think this is it.
[5453.82s -> 5454.62s]  120 cents.
[5454.62s -> 5455.58s]  I'm not doing that.
[5455.58s -> 5460.35s]  I think we're dry.
[5460.35s -> 5463.12s]  Just hold on a second.
[5463.12s -> 5467.34s]  50 cents.
[5467.34s -> 5468.14s]  I gotta sell.
[5468.14s -> 5477.36s]  Oh I don't care.
[5477.36s -> 5478.16s]  Final month is fine.

[5479.12s -> 5481.12s]  Hold hold hold don't no no no no no no.
[5481.12s -> 5481.92s]  The price is climbing.
[5481.92s -> 5487.63s]  Don't do that.
[5487.63s -> 5488.35s]  I'll make more money.
[5488.35s -> 5512.40s]  I'll make more money.
[5512.40s -> 5514.16s]  Five grand that was bad.
[5514.16s -> 5524.08s]  Okay if you can see a diamond you need a mold to get it above ground.
[5524.08s -> 5525.84s]  I can teach them this valuable skill.
[5525.84s -> 5531.10s]  Don't feel like going around rocks then go straight through them with the special drill
[5531.10s -> 5532.78s]  I'm offering at my factory.
[5532.78s -> 5536.51s]  Our need for oil brings us to the desert.
[5536.51s -> 5542.52s]  Here you can stumble upon rocks and diamonds in the ground.
[5542.52s -> 5543.16s]  All right.
[5543.16s -> 5547.40s]  Diamond hunting moles.
[5547.40s -> 5550.73s]  That's pretty cool.
[5551.29s -> 5552.41s]  I can work with that.
[5552.41s -> 5559.26s]  Anthony might be in the saloon to help you out in exchange for a diamond.
[5559.26s -> 5561.90s]  He'll point out an oil rich parcel to you.
[5564.04s -> 5564.84s]  Really?
[5564.84s -> 5571.36s]  What do you guys think?
[5571.36s -> 5572.24s]  I'm thinking right.
[5572.24s -> 5573.92s]  I'm thinking all the way to the bottom right.
[5573.92s -> 5579.58s]  Yeah the top right or bottom right I think is what I'm gonna do.
[5579.58s -> 5586.24s]  Right in the mid?
[5586.24s -> 5588.27s]  Should ask the guy.
[5588.27s -> 5589.36s]  Well I need a diamond.
[5589.36s -> 5590.48s]  I don't have a diamond.
[5590.48s -> 5594.72s]  I'm going right here.
[5594.72s -> 5598.33s]  Hope it was worth it.
[5598.33s -> 5599.21s]  All right I got some money.
[5602.04s -> 5604.04s]  Moles will dig even faster.
[5604.04s -> 5606.33s]  I can have a scanner.
[5606.33s -> 5610.33s]  If you want to know exactly what sits where under the surface use the scanner.
[5610.33s -> 5612.84s]  That sounds really good.
[5613.56s -> 5614.68s]  Diamonds.
[5614.68s -> 5619.02s]  I can train moles so they dig up diamonds.
[5619.02s -> 5622.54s]  It's expensive.
[5632.09s -> 5633.61s]  Left will never be 81.
[5637.05s -> 5638.25s]  Always over 70.
[5638.25s -> 5638.81s]  That's bad.
[5639.69s -> 5643.66s]  It's also bad.
[5644.22s -> 5645.50s]  I thought it was 20 bucks.
[5645.50s -> 5646.38s]  I was like wait hold on.
[5647.10s -> 5647.98s]  All right factory.
[5648.62s -> 5651.55s]  The drill.
[5652.94s -> 5655.98s]  Found a new drilling method which allows you to drill through rocks.
[5655.98s -> 5656.46s]  Uh oh.
[5660.60s -> 5661.40s]  That's not good.
[5664.08s -> 5665.52s]  Well I hope they find some diamonds.
[5667.23s -> 5669.07s]  This is a long stream for you Jerma.
[5669.07s -> 5671.63s]  I told you we were doing game gamer weekend.
[5673.07s -> 5674.35s]  I'm I don't want to leave.
[5674.35s -> 5675.23s]  I'm having a great time.
[5675.23s -> 5676.03s]  I want I'm gonna stay.
[5676.59s -> 5678.09s]  I'll stay for a while.
[5678.09s -> 5681.04s]  That's why I started early.
[5681.04s -> 5683.79s]  This game's I love this game.
[5683.79s -> 5685.39s]  Should I beat this game like right now?
[5686.27s -> 5689.37s]  Should I go eat food come back and just and just beat this game?
[5689.93s -> 5697.64s]  Put a mold directly on it if you find a diamond.
[5697.64s -> 5699.92s]  All right well get to work guys.
[5701.20s -> 5702.08s]  Mole friends.
[5702.08s -> 5712.75s]  That's rock.
[5716.33s -> 5731.47s]  I'm concerned about this because I can't drill through that.
[5731.47s -> 5752.86s]  Okay there's no I think I'm all right.
[5752.86s -> 5753.74s]  70 a dollar.
[5753.74s -> 5754.78s]  All right let's go.
[5754.78s -> 5770.27s]  Change sides.
[5770.27s -> 5770.99s]  All right stop.
[5770.99s -> 5774.49s]  Store it.
[5774.49s -> 5778.03s]  Now I'm gonna go here.
[5778.03s -> 5780.65s]  Here.
[5780.65s -> 5785.16s]  Slowly kind of make my way down.
[5785.16s -> 5789.34s]  Double this up.
[5789.34s -> 5790.14s]  Another horse.
[5790.14s -> 5791.98s]  I need more horses right now.
[5791.98s -> 5795.52s]  71 cents it's all right.
[5795.52s -> 5798.24s]  It's gonna it's not ideal but I'm gonna do it.
[5798.24s -> 5800.30s]  I need the money.
[5800.30s -> 5802.46s]  Okay store it.
[5802.46s -> 5803.98s]  I need more horses.
[5803.98s -> 5810.08s]  What's the point of the game?
[5810.08s -> 5830.41s]  Make a bunch of money and become an oil tycoon.
[5830.41s -> 5832.25s]  All right start selling left side.
[5832.25s -> 5843.87s]  Some more mole action.
[5843.87s -> 5854.84s]  I just don't want to hit rock.
[5854.84s -> 5855.80s]  It might break it.
[5855.80s -> 5885.15s]  This is a big one right here.
[5885.15s -> 5890.40s]  Oh all right start storing it.
[5890.40s -> 5892.00s]  Do I can I drill around this?
[5892.00s -> 5901.50s]  How do I get around this?
[5901.50s -> 5906.24s]  Or can I not?
[5906.24s -> 5907.44s]  I don't I think that goes all the way.
[5907.44s -> 5924.28s]  I think I have to go right.
[5924.28s -> 5925.48s]  Shit I gotta get down here.
[5925.48s -> 5929.84s]  This better not go all the way around.
[5929.84s -> 5933.47s]  So much shit over here.
[5933.47s -> 5934.83s]  All right 92 cents right side.
[5934.83s -> 5949.02s]  Start selling it.
[5949.02s -> 5960.67s]  Whoa stop go the other way.
[5960.67s -> 5961.71s]  Actually perfect.
[5961.71s -> 5965.50s]  All right we're good.
[5965.50s -> 5966.78s]  Now I can slow down a little.
[5966.78s -> 5968.30s]  Because I need to get around here.
[5968.30s -> 5971.55s]  Question is where do I want to go from here?
[5971.55s -> 5978.36s]  There's no rock here right?
[5978.36s -> 5991.58s]  There might not be anything else over here.
[5991.58s -> 5999.05s]  I'll dig.
[5999.05s -> 6000.57s]  I don't want to spend too much money digging down.
[6000.57s -> 6001.90s]  There's nothing there.
[6001.90s -> 6003.02s]  I could go this way.
[6003.02s -> 6025.23s]  I think this is stuck.
[6025.23s -> 6041.77s]  Spending money to dig a hole to make money.
[6044.86s -> 6046.14s]  I mean kind of.
[6046.14s -> 6055.79s]  I'm literally getting this game right now.
[6055.79s -> 6057.92s]  This is addicting.
[6057.92s -> 6059.12s]  It really is.
[6059.12s -> 6060.00s]  It just is.
[6060.00s -> 6065.00s]  It's great.
[6065.00s -> 6068.46s]  Not too complicated.
[6068.46s -> 6070.99s]  It's just kind of you gotta make you gotta be.
[6070.99s -> 6072.27s]  It's just some RNG right?
[6072.27s -> 6073.87s]  You gotta find the thing to dig into.
[6076.70s -> 6080.51s]  I don't I click oh.
[6081.47s -> 6084.48s]  All right I'm gonna go from.
[6084.48s -> 6090.20s]  What does that mean?
[6090.20s -> 6098.97s]  What does this mean though?
[6098.97s -> 6100.81s]  Why close and open?
[6100.81s -> 6105.55s]  Is it to divert or something?
[6105.55s -> 6107.71s]  I don't want to make another one just for a tiny little thing.
[6107.71s -> 6109.48s]  How much is it gonna cost to get over there?
[6109.48s -> 6111.40s]  $278.
[6111.40s -> 6114.16s]  It might cost the same amount of money.
[6114.16s -> 6117.82s]  To just build one.
[6117.82s -> 6137.48s]  Caught it on the way down but it's all right.
[6137.48s -> 6138.28s]  Left side.
[6138.28s -> 6159.61s]  Branch from second node on the middle well.
[6159.61s -> 6163.04s]  Uh I don't I don't have um I didn't upgrade that.
[6163.04s -> 6171.52s]  This might actually be it.
[6171.52s -> 6181.76s]  That was it.
[6181.76s -> 6186.96s]  That was a terrible plot.
[6186.96s -> 6192.41s]  That was such a bad plot.
[6192.41s -> 6193.95s]  The rocks all over the place.
[6193.95s -> 6194.67s]  Who picked that?
[6199.93s -> 6204.44s]  Okay that is the worst plot in the entire game.
[6204.44s -> 6207.69s]  In the entire two hours we've been playing this.
[6207.69s -> 6209.34s]  24.
[6209.34s -> 6211.98s]  Even the tutorial zone had more.
[6211.98s -> 6221.44s]  Do I want to upgrade anything?
[6221.44s -> 6227.31s]  77 cents.
[6227.31s -> 6235.32s]  Save for the drill.
[6235.32s -> 6245.15s]  Yeah I don't even use the dowsers.
[6245.15s -> 6246.56s]  They're too slow.
[6246.56s -> 6252.89s]  All right yeah I can't spend any money.
[6252.89s -> 6254.01s]  That was a bad one.
[6254.01s -> 6256.03s]  All right where?
[6256.03s -> 6257.56s]  What do you think?
[6257.56s -> 6261.79s]  I don't want you to see my like yellow stained armpits.
[6261.79s -> 6263.23s]  So I'm gonna move over this way.
[6263.23s -> 6268.99s]  I still like work out in this shirt.
[6268.99s -> 6272.04s]  If anyone's figuring that out.
[6272.04s -> 6273.77s]  Pop left.
[6273.77s -> 6284.88s]  Good.
[6284.88s -> 6285.92s]  We all picked one.
[6285.92s -> 6287.20s]  Okay hopefully mine was right.
[6287.20s -> 6288.16s]  This could be huge.
[6288.16s -> 6292.04s]  This could change the rest of the course of the entire game.
[6292.04s -> 6298.81s]  I gotta play efficiently.
[6298.81s -> 6317.84s]  Not bad.
[6317.84s -> 6338.08s]  Stupid you're an idiot.
[6338.08s -> 6338.96s]  Why did I do that?
[6338.96s -> 6350.08s]  Sell right.
[6350.08s -> 6358.84s]  Sell right.
[6358.84s -> 6359.48s]  Keep going.
[6359.48s -> 6360.20s]  Keep selling right.
[6366.78s -> 6371.85s]  Left side.
[6371.85s -> 6374.72s]  All right it's still pretty good.
[6374.72s -> 6376.97s]  Let's start putting this together.
[6376.97s -> 6381.58s]  I hope there's no rocks here.
[6381.58s -> 6382.38s]  That would be bad.
[6382.38s -> 6397.48s]  All right it's gonna start flowing pretty hard now.
[6397.48s -> 6405.98s]  Oh my goodness.
[6405.98s -> 6421.80s]  I need some more horses right now.
[6421.80s -> 6422.68s]  Not prepared.
[6422.68s -> 6423.96s]  I wasn't prepared.
[6423.96s -> 6430.22s]  I'm not getting a fee every time this happens right.
[6430.22s -> 6432.14s]  Why are you storing it?
[6432.14s -> 6434.94s]  Oh my god what a disaster.
[6434.94s -> 6446.59s]  What a disaster.
[6446.59s -> 6464.17s]  There we go.
[6464.17s -> 6464.97s]  This is huge.
[6464.97s -> 6465.85s]  I'm going this way.
[6465.85s -> 6500.68s]  A monumentally huge one.
[6500.68s -> 6501.48s]  Oh shit.
[6501.48s -> 6502.36s]  Okay there's more.
[6502.36s -> 6521.07s]  Connect these two.
[6522.19s -> 6523.71s]  All right this is looking pretty good.
[6523.71s -> 6524.83s]  Count some money over this say.
[6524.83s -> 6525.79s]  Hold on the left side.
[6525.79s -> 6530.59s]  It's a mole action.
[6530.59s -> 6542.60s]  Still over a dollar.
[6542.60s -> 6544.28s]  A dollar seven still over on left side.
[6544.28s -> 6556.67s]  Okay that's better.
[6556.67s -> 6557.47s]  I wonder if I should.
[6557.55s -> 6558.51s]  Okay there we go.
[6558.51s -> 6559.15s]  Right here.
[6559.15s -> 6577.28s]  All right I'm gonna stop selling here.
[6577.28s -> 6578.40s]  All right stop selling.
[6578.40s -> 6586.16s]  You go to the right side.
[6586.16s -> 6587.20s]  There's more over this way.
[6587.20s -> 6588.64s]  I might connect these two together.
[6588.64s -> 6598.44s]  Start selling right side.
[6598.44s -> 6616.68s]  All back on the right side after this batch.
[6616.68s -> 6617.40s]  Back to depositing.
[6617.40s -> 6618.76s]  We're gonna wait till it's over a dollar
[6618.76s -> 6619.72s]  and then we're gonna go for it.
[6619.72s -> 6632.30s]  We're gonna go super mode.
[6632.30s -> 6639.08s]  Oops.
[6639.08s -> 6650.12s]  All right start selling.
[6650.12s -> 6650.76s]  Uh oh.
[6650.76s -> 6669.53s]  We're just gonna do drain it from three.
[6669.53s -> 6675.26s]  Uh oh.
[6675.26s -> 6676.54s]  All right I need more selling.
[6676.54s -> 6688.52s]  I need any more room.
[6688.52s -> 6690.68s]  Not an ideal price but it's not a bad one either.
[6690.68s -> 6709.87s]  Oil patch for our left.
[6709.87s -> 6711.15s]  I got it going for it.
[6711.15s -> 6718.22s]  I'm okay with 84 cents.
[6718.22s -> 6718.70s]  That's good.
[6718.70s -> 6725.37s]  September.
[6725.37s -> 6727.21s]  Unless let's is there anything down here?
[6727.21s -> 6735.53s]  Just if there's something down there
[6735.53s -> 6736.09s]  then you know what I mean.
[6736.09s -> 6740.80s]  We gotta be careful.
[6740.80s -> 6741.52s]  Now this is it.
[6741.52s -> 6742.72s]  Is it just this here
[6742.72s -> 6744.48s]  and then I gotta wrap back around and get this.
[6744.48s -> 6748.67s]  All right start storing it.
[6748.67s -> 6752.08s]  All right this one's almost drained completely.
[6752.08s -> 6757.82s]  I'm going.
[6757.82s -> 6759.52s]  I know I'm an idiot but whatever.
[6759.52s -> 6760.08s]  I need it.
[6760.08s -> 6761.52s]  I want the thousand dollar bonus.
[6761.52s -> 6773.13s]  Shit this one below it too.
[6773.13s -> 6774.89s]  Oh come on really.
[6774.89s -> 6814.08s]  There's nothing else over here.
[6814.08s -> 6816.96s]  700 dollars to get a bonus of a thousand.
[6816.96s -> 6833.37s]  I think that's it.
[6833.37s -> 6842.49s]  This looks like shit but whatever.
[6842.49s -> 6843.61s]  All right get it.
[6845.85s -> 6846.33s]  Hurry up.
[6846.33s -> 6846.81s]  Suck it up.
[6846.81s -> 6847.13s]  Suck it up.
[6847.13s -> 6847.45s]  Suck it up.
[6847.45s -> 6847.85s]  Suck it up.
[6847.85s -> 6848.65s]  Quick quick quick quick.
[6851.12s -> 6851.84s]  Did I get it?
[6851.84s -> 6873.29s]  What should I do?
[6873.29s -> 6875.60s]  The rock drill is really important.
[6875.60s -> 6882.32s]  You know where's that factory?
[6882.32s -> 6883.36s]  30,000.
[6883.36s -> 6885.31s]  You found a new drill method
[6885.31s -> 6887.23s]  which allows you to drill through rock.
[6887.23s -> 6889.82s]  Yes and that's all I'm going to do for now.
[6891.26s -> 6891.82s]  Anything cheap.
[6896.57s -> 6897.69s]  Sure I'll get it just to get it.
[6897.69s -> 6898.65s]  Why not?
[6898.65s -> 6903.79s]  Okay I can go through a rock now.
[6903.79s -> 6904.91s]  Oh the branch.
[6905.71s -> 6906.67s]  Oh all right.
[6907.96s -> 6909.40s]  Okay remind me to do that next time
[6909.40s -> 6911.32s]  because I can't just not do that.
[6911.32s -> 6915.39s]  That one was really good.
[6915.39s -> 6917.05s]  It was like 40 grand.
[6917.05s -> 6919.36s]  I'm staying up here.
[6919.36s -> 6921.53s]  Probably right here right?
[6921.53s -> 6923.21s]  This is 48, 54.
[6923.21s -> 6925.85s]  This has to be at least like 50
[6925.85s -> 6928.60s]  or probably up here all the way to the top.
[6928.60s -> 6930.76s]  Let's try this one.
[6934.16s -> 6935.79s]  Outbid huh?
[6935.79s -> 6936.83s]  Fine I'll just outbid you.
[6939.64s -> 6940.44s]  Really?
[6940.44s -> 6941.64s]  Fine I'll just outbid you.
[6945.55s -> 6946.35s]  Stop.
[6946.35s -> 6950.99s]  Who has more money?
[6957.82s -> 6959.10s]  I'm not going higher than 6k.
[6963.47s -> 6966.48s]  What are you guys doing?
[6966.48s -> 6977.80s]  What are you doing?
[6977.80s -> 6978.68s]  He scammed me.
[6978.68s -> 6979.80s]  He did it on purpose.
[6979.80s -> 6981.00s]  Okay what did I just do?
[6981.00s -> 6981.88s]  10,000?
[6981.88s -> 6986.12s]  Okay I'm in trouble.
[6986.12s -> 6990.04s]  Because it costs 2,000.
[6990.04s -> 6991.00s]  No I'm all right.
[6991.00s -> 6992.65s]  And I got the drill too.
[6992.65s -> 6993.45s]  All right we're good.
[6993.45s -> 6994.09s]  I'm just gonna get...
[6994.09s -> 6995.45s]  These moles gotta do work right now.
[6996.17s -> 6998.17s]  Put them strategically.
[7000.62s -> 7002.14s]  Okay let the moles do their thing.
[7008.40s -> 7009.66s]  Good job.
[7009.66s -> 7010.30s]  Nice work.
[7010.30s -> 7011.10s]  Excellent work over there.
[7011.10s -> 7012.89s]  Let's get started right now.
[7012.89s -> 7014.89s]  Wait this is gonna get us some...
[7014.89s -> 7017.61s]  Yep.
[7017.61s -> 7018.65s]  Wait you have to upgrade it.
[7022.08s -> 7022.72s]  I have to.
[7022.72s -> 7023.68s]  It's 750.
[7023.68s -> 7024.96s]  Okay all right all right.
[7026.22s -> 7027.82s]  Let's get this started right now
[7027.82s -> 7030.54s]  and we got some good good good good.
[7030.54s -> 7033.39s]  Okay very good very good very good.
[7033.39s -> 7035.18s]  I'm gonna go here.
[7037.50s -> 7037.98s]  Right here.
[7040.40s -> 7040.88s]  Right there.
[7041.44s -> 7043.98s]  A couple of horses.
[7043.98s -> 7044.54s]  I'm gonna do...
[7044.54s -> 7049.79s]  I'm gonna sell on the one-in-one.
[7049.79s -> 7052.56s]  I don't want...
[7052.56s -> 7053.92s]  Don't upgrade this shit yet
[7053.92s -> 7054.88s]  until I can handle it.
[7054.88s -> 7056.16s]  I do this every single time.
[7056.16s -> 7079.77s]  Start storing it.
[7079.77s -> 7082.59s]  I'm now prepared to upgrade these.
[7082.59s -> 7085.45s]  I'm gonna go with the second drill here.
[7110.76s -> 7111.80s]  No it didn't spill.
[7111.80s -> 7112.76s]  That's such horse shit.
[7112.76s -> 7127.21s]  Can we go this way?
[7127.21s -> 7164.49s]  I was scared that I wasn't gonna make it through this.
[7164.49s -> 7166.01s]  I thought there was gonna be a wall here.
[7166.01s -> 7169.12s]  All right we're good.
[7169.12s -> 7187.23s]  You don't have it?
[7187.23s -> 7188.11s]  I thought you did.
[7188.11s -> 7189.16s]  You do now.
[7189.16s -> 7212.04s]  All right store.
[7212.04s -> 7215.24s]  This is where we're gonna start to make tons of money.
[7215.24s -> 7228.33s]  I paid 10 grand for this spot.
[7228.33s -> 7229.61s]  There better be more than this.
[7229.61s -> 7231.36s]  It's a joke.
[7231.36s -> 7255.37s]  What's happening?
[7255.37s -> 7263.90s]  I was too lasered in.
[7263.90s -> 7269.12s]  I was lasered in to just that spot right there.
[7269.12s -> 7269.92s]  And I wasn't paying...
[7269.92s -> 7270.72s]  I'm in trouble.
[7270.72s -> 7277.63s]  This is bad.
[7277.63s -> 7278.99s]  So quick.
[7278.99s -> 7291.37s]  Everything's fine.
[7291.37s -> 7314.01s]  What a trash fucking place to do this in.
[7314.01s -> 7315.45s]  What a garbage place.
[7316.41s -> 7323.21s]  I paid $10,000 for the amount of oil that would fit in a Capri Sun.
[7323.21s -> 7341.95s]  Are you kidding me?
[7341.95s -> 7343.07s]  See anything over there?
[7343.07s -> 7348.94s]  We're at a standstill.
[7348.94s -> 7350.06s]  I think I got everything.
[7350.06s -> 7359.93s]  There's no oil to get anymore.
[7359.93s -> 7360.81s]  There's no more oil.
[7360.81s -> 7367.04s]  I paid $10,000 for this place.
[7367.04s -> 7376.00s]  There's one snot rocket down here.
[7376.00s -> 7376.48s]  Great.
[7376.48s -> 7394.11s]  This guy hasn't found shit.
[7394.11s -> 7395.39s]  Unleash the moles?
[7395.39s -> 7409.48s]  All right unleash the moles I guess.
[7409.48s -> 7410.04s]  You got something?
[7410.04s -> 7410.84s]  You found something.
[7410.84s -> 7411.64s]  Oh my god.
[7411.64s -> 7412.36s]  Okay dude.
[7412.36s -> 7412.92s]  Fine.
[7412.92s -> 7419.26s]  That's it.
[7419.26s -> 7429.88s]  Store it.
[7429.88s -> 7434.76s]  Do I just go over here?
[7434.76s -> 7448.92s]  November.
[7448.92s -> 7450.78s]  What happened over here?
[7450.78s -> 7456.38s]  That shit just crashed to five cents.
[7456.38s -> 7457.02s]  All right.
[7457.02s -> 7457.90s]  Start selling.
[7457.90s -> 7463.56s]  Go.
[7463.56s -> 7464.44s]  $30,000.
[7464.44s -> 7465.56s]  Did I get it all?
[7465.56s -> 7466.36s]  All right.
[7466.36s -> 7467.08s]  I think that's empty.
[7467.08s -> 7467.72s]  Let's see.
[7467.72s -> 7469.85s]  I think I got everything.
[7469.85s -> 7475.28s]  That was not worth $10,000.
[7475.28s -> 7478.27s]  It was empty over here.
[7478.27s -> 7482.25s]  I mean oh my god.
[7482.25s -> 7483.61s]  $10,000 for the land.
[7483.61s -> 7486.97s]  $7,000 for you know just do the math.
[7486.97s -> 7495.87s]  Down $17,000.
[7495.87s -> 7499.16s]  I want to see that.
[7499.16s -> 7499.88s]  $45,000.
[7499.88s -> 7500.84s]  I guess that was okay.
[7502.43s -> 7507.15s]  Not worth $10,000.
[7507.15s -> 7508.72s]  Sleepy talking?
[7509.28s -> 7510.64s]  No it's just headphone talking.
[7510.64s -> 7512.70s]  Just speech jams me.
[7512.70s -> 7513.26s]  All right.
[7513.26s -> 7514.38s]  Branch time.
[7514.38s -> 7520.56s]  So I can go.
[7520.56s -> 7522.40s]  I can split pipes.
[7522.40s -> 7523.04s]  There we go.
[7523.04s -> 7523.84s]  I got it.
[7523.84s -> 7528.19s]  Let's go for it.
[7528.19s -> 7531.98s]  I mean very obviously it's up here.
[7531.98s -> 7534.86s]  But there's no way I'm going to.
[7534.86s -> 7546.70s]  I actually can't spend more than like a few thousand on this.
[7546.70s -> 7548.68s]  I'm not going higher than that.
[7548.68s -> 7549.24s]  No.
[7549.24s -> 7549.88s]  Fuck you.
[7549.88s -> 7550.44s]  I'll go here.
[7553.44s -> 7554.00s]  Enjoy it.
[7554.00s -> 7554.40s]  Enjoy.
[7554.40s -> 7555.84s]  Hey enjoy your Capri Sun.
[7555.84s -> 7557.60s]  Because that's literally what you're going to get there.
[7557.60s -> 7568.84s]  Is that three pipes?
[7568.84s -> 7578.88s]  I kind of went overboard with the moles.
[7578.88s -> 7591.00s]  Okay well this is a big one.
[7591.00s -> 7618.46s]  Fuck.
[7618.54s -> 7619.50s]  Did it wrong.
[7619.50s -> 7642.46s]  Wait I could do this right?
[7642.46s -> 7643.58s]  Okay yeah I can do that.
[7643.58s -> 7650.27s]  Make some money.
[7650.27s -> 7650.83s]  Let's go.
[7650.83s -> 7656.33s]  No no no no no.
[7656.33s -> 7656.81s]  How do I stop?
[7656.81s -> 7657.85s]  So oh no we're good.
[7657.85s -> 7669.69s]  Okay this is not bad.
[7669.69s -> 7677.28s]  Very nice.
[7677.28s -> 7677.60s]  All right.
[7677.60s -> 7678.88s]  So this is just going to drain.
[7678.88s -> 7680.94s]  Get some mole action.
[7680.94s -> 7702.67s]  Got something on the right here.
[7702.67s -> 7704.43s]  Silo going right in the middle.
[7704.43s -> 7705.71s]  Directly in the middle.
[7705.71s -> 7709.07s]  Another one right here.
[7709.07s -> 7712.81s]  Okay when this one's done we're going to go down.
[7712.81s -> 7713.21s]  I might.
[7713.21s -> 7717.71s]  Should I do two here?
[7717.71s -> 7718.67s]  I'm going to store it.
[7718.67s -> 7719.47s]  That's too far to go.
[7719.47s -> 7720.35s]  I'm going to spill.
[7720.35s -> 7740.22s]  Maybe I won't.
[7740.22s -> 7742.44s]  I knew I was going to spill.
[7742.44s -> 7743.48s]  Don't do it.
[7743.48s -> 7751.13s]  Got it.
[7751.13s -> 7753.42s]  Okay we're good.
[7753.42s -> 7756.62s]  Now close the pipe.
[7756.62s -> 7757.18s]  Who closed it?
[7757.18s -> 7757.66s]  What?
[7757.66s -> 7759.98s]  What are you talking about?
[7759.98s -> 7760.70s]  What do you want?
[7760.70s -> 7762.27s]  Close the valve.
[7762.27s -> 7762.75s]  Don't.
[7762.75s -> 7763.47s]  What do you mean close it?
[7763.47s -> 7768.51s]  What do you want me to do?
[7768.51s -> 7769.95s]  Oh that's.
[7769.95s -> 7771.39s]  I can just do it right here.
[7771.39s -> 7773.04s]  I understand what that means now.
[7773.04s -> 7779.74s]  Okay okay we got a big one here.
[7779.74s -> 7780.62s]  I need money.
[7780.62s -> 7783.00s]  Start selling on the right side.
[7783.00s -> 7792.92s]  Of course the price goes down immediately.
[7792.92s -> 7793.88s]  Oh go left.
[7793.88s -> 7819.08s]  Okay don't sell right at all.
[7819.08s -> 7823.32s]  You look like Elmo today.
[7823.32s -> 7825.13s]  Oh do I?
[7825.13s -> 7826.75s]  Thanks.
[7826.75s -> 7829.58s]  You thought I was going to do it.
[7829.58s -> 7830.86s]  You were waiting for it.
[7830.86s -> 7852.16s]  Okay let's.
[7852.16s -> 7853.60s]  Okay actually keep selling on the left.
[7859.21s -> 7860.73s]  There's more down here.
[7860.73s -> 7870.59s]  I need more.
[7870.59s -> 7874.20s]  I'm gonna.
[7874.20s -> 7875.32s]  Yeah it's July.
[7875.32s -> 7877.29s]  I'm gonna double drain this one.
[7877.29s -> 7879.48s]  It is fucking July.
[7879.48s -> 7880.44s]  Like I gotta go.
[7880.44s -> 7917.32s]  Grab that right side.
[7917.32s -> 7927.39s]  Right side.
[7927.39s -> 7927.63s]  Come on.
[7927.63s -> 7927.79s]  Come on.
[7927.79s -> 7931.20s]  It's a dollar.
[7931.20s -> 7932.08s]  All right stop.
[7932.08s -> 7936.06s]  Where are we going next?
[7936.06s -> 7938.36s]  I need some bowls.
[7938.36s -> 7954.62s]  Okay I think this is almost done.
[7954.62s -> 7955.66s]  What's with the oil?
[7955.66s -> 7960.91s]  What's with this terrible just non no oil here?
[7960.91s -> 7963.58s]  This is none.
[7963.58s -> 7964.06s]  I spent.
[7964.06s -> 7964.94s]  Did I spend money here?
[7964.94s -> 7965.66s]  No I didn't.
[7965.66s -> 7967.23s]  Pretty much free.
[7967.23s -> 7974.51s]  But this shit is empty man.
[7974.51s -> 7991.69s]  What a bust.
[7991.69s -> 7997.02s]  Unless there's something over here.
[8009.50s -> 8010.46s]  No that's it.
[8010.46s -> 8012.54s]  I think I'm gonna get out of here.
[8012.54s -> 8014.54s]  Everything's empty right?
[8014.54s -> 8016.16s]  All right let's get the thousand bucks back.
[8016.16s -> 8016.96s]  There's nothing else here.
[8016.96s -> 8018.24s]  This place is a fucking joke.
[8018.24s -> 8026.09s]  This place is a joke.
[8026.09s -> 8035.24s]  Okay 30k.
[8035.24s -> 8045.07s]  Somebody give me 76 is not enough.
[8045.07s -> 8047.23s]  Make it 90 and I'll pay five grand for it.
[8047.23s -> 8050.22s]  Which I do now.
[8050.22s -> 8051.85s]  No spilling.
[8051.85s -> 8052.49s]  Yeah that's right.
[8052.49s -> 8067.40s]  I really think I want that right now.
[8067.40s -> 8070.70s]  Dowsing rod.
[8071.34s -> 8073.07s]  I don't really use them.
[8073.07s -> 8073.79s]  We could do moles.
[8074.78s -> 8076.94s]  Faster moles for the scanner.
[8076.94s -> 8079.29s]  Thicker pipes.
[8079.29s -> 8080.89s]  Yeah that's probably the best to play.
[8082.11s -> 8084.19s]  With three size three.
[8084.19s -> 8085.15s]  With three.
[8085.15s -> 8089.40s]  Yeah we can really just drain it.
[8089.40s -> 8089.72s]  All right.
[8090.44s -> 8091.16s]  With three.
[8091.80s -> 8097.15s]  Yeah that was pretty bad.
[8097.15s -> 8098.17s]  That's where it just was.
[8098.17s -> 8098.57s]  Look at this.
[8100.11s -> 8101.23s]  First dig.
[8102.27s -> 8103.15s]  Second dig.
[8103.15s -> 8103.71s]  Third dig.
[8104.86s -> 8105.66s]  Terrible.
[8105.66s -> 8110.06s]  Maybe go to the bottom.
[8110.06s -> 8115.29s]  Should I go right down to the bottom?
[8115.29s -> 8120.59s]  I don't know if I want this.
[8120.59s -> 8121.71s]  I'm at 35.
[8122.43s -> 8123.39s]  28.
[8123.39s -> 8124.96s]  42.
[8124.96s -> 8126.80s]  The adjacent ones are gonna be terrible.
[8126.80s -> 8128.80s]  I'm just gonna go right down here.
[8128.80s -> 8133.08s]  Yeah they're gonna.
[8133.08s -> 8133.56s]  I knew it.
[8133.56s -> 8136.94s]  I knew that's what was gonna happen.
[8136.94s -> 8146.56s]  I'm not getting involved.
[8146.56s -> 8147.92s]  Oh they're upgrading stuff.
[8147.92s -> 8148.32s]  I get it.
[8148.32s -> 8149.58s]  Okay.
[8149.58s -> 8150.46s]  All right let's go.
[8150.46s -> 8158.22s]  I'm gonna upgrade pipes twice.
[8158.22s -> 8158.94s]  All right moles.
[8159.74s -> 8162.38s]  I like the moles more than the dowsing people.
[8165.95s -> 8167.15s]  All right don't go overboard.
[8167.15s -> 8168.75s]  I'm going overboard so bad.
[8168.75s -> 8178.56s]  Stop.
[8178.56s -> 8181.61s]  Start.
[8181.61s -> 8182.81s]  And here's my plan.
[8182.81s -> 8192.08s]  Is this stupid?
[8192.08s -> 8195.52s]  Is this stupid?
[8196.08s -> 8202.57s]  Because then I'm gonna go bang bang.
[8202.57s -> 8203.21s]  Is that stupid?
[8214.70s -> 8216.70s]  What's happening?
[8216.70s -> 8220.11s]  I fucked up bad.
[8220.11s -> 8222.19s]  I don't have a fucking horse.
[8222.19s -> 8227.88s]  Did I lose?
[8227.88s -> 8231.28s]  Is the game over?
[8231.28s -> 8232.92s]  Oh okay.
[8232.92s -> 8234.04s]  I'll take a $500 loan.
[8234.04s -> 8234.60s]  Thank you.
[8234.60s -> 8239.26s]  I thought I actually just lost the game.
[8276.88s -> 8278.64s]  This is dumb what I'm doing isn't it?
[8280.16s -> 8300.12s]  Maybe not.
[8300.12s -> 8311.84s]  Oh there's so much money on that left side and right side.
[8311.84s -> 8315.36s]  All right thank god.
[8315.36s -> 8316.56s]  Okay back in the game.
[8316.56s -> 8317.20s]  Let's go.
[8317.20s -> 8325.10s]  There's something right there.
[8325.10s -> 8342.36s]  No diamonds though weirdly enough.
[8342.36s -> 8343.16s]  Pay the loan?
[8343.16s -> 8348.04s]  How do I pay the loan?
[8348.04s -> 8349.08s]  Total debt 700.
[8349.08s -> 8350.04s]  How do I pay the loan?
[8350.04s -> 8353.31s]  Can I pay it from here?
[8353.31s -> 8363.00s]  I don't think I can do it from.
[8363.00s -> 8363.80s]  You pay it at the end.
[8363.80s -> 8364.92s]  Yeah that's all right.
[8364.92s -> 8366.92s]  It's not gonna be too bad.
[8374.28s -> 8376.04s]  All right this is level three.
[8376.04s -> 8384.46s]  I need to okay.
[8384.46s -> 8385.88s]  Is there any more oil?
[8385.88s -> 8391.53s]  This one's a lot.
[8391.53s -> 8394.25s]  So okay this is gonna be overflowing soon.
[8394.25s -> 8399.71s]  I knew it.
[8399.71s -> 8400.83s]  I'm trying to get in front of it.
[8400.83s -> 8402.24s]  Okay we're good.
[8402.24s -> 8403.04s]  Don't sell anything.
[8403.04s -> 8404.32s]  These are terrible prices.
[8404.32s -> 8411.71s]  All right I'm gonna go right here.
[8411.71s -> 8417.18s]  Got something?
[8417.18s -> 8418.06s]  Oh of course you do.
[8418.06s -> 8419.74s]  Why am I even hiring that guy?
[8419.74s -> 8422.38s]  I'm gonna be in trouble.
[8422.38s -> 8424.14s]  This is these prices are bad.
[8424.14s -> 8432.16s]  Please look at this.
[8432.80s -> 8433.76s]  What's with this price?
[8437.31s -> 8439.04s]  Just close it?
[8439.04s -> 8440.00s]  30 cents?
[8441.39s -> 8442.59s]  No you can fuck off.
[8442.59s -> 8453.15s]  I'm not 30 cents.
[8453.15s -> 8454.19s]  40 cents?
[8454.35s -> 8455.47s]  I have to dump it.
[8455.47s -> 8459.23s]  I actually have to dump this.
[8459.23s -> 8460.96s]  Because it's gonna start spilling.
[8460.96s -> 8462.16s]  I'm gonna have to pay.
[8462.16s -> 8463.93s]  Take another silo.
[8463.93s -> 8473.05s]  Just I mean of course.
[8473.05s -> 8476.09s]  Of course the price literally is fine now.
[8476.09s -> 8479.15s]  No I'm not selling.
[8479.15s -> 8479.71s]  Stop.
[8479.71s -> 8480.35s]  Stop it.
[8480.35s -> 8481.07s]  No selling.
[8481.07s -> 8485.08s]  Actually no this is okay.
[8485.08s -> 8485.40s]  That's all right.
[8485.40s -> 8486.20s]  Dump dump dump dump.
[8486.20s -> 8486.60s]  Get rid of it.
[8486.60s -> 8488.83s]  Dump it all.
[8488.83s -> 8489.31s]  Wait hold on.
[8489.31s -> 8489.95s]  No no no no no.
[8489.95s -> 8490.35s]  Stop hold on.
[8490.35s -> 8493.00s]  Don't do it yet.
[8493.00s -> 8493.80s]  95 cents?
[8493.80s -> 8495.08s]  It's gonna be up like a dollar something.
[8495.08s -> 8503.53s]  Okay hold on.
[8503.53s -> 8506.36s]  It's almost time.
[8506.36s -> 8513.60s]  Nope.
[8513.60s -> 8514.96s]  Oh yes.
[8514.96s -> 8519.61s]  Look at that one.
[8519.61s -> 8521.37s]  Oh we did it at the perfect time.
[8521.37s -> 8522.33s]  Perfect timing.
[8522.33s -> 8524.65s]  Let's go.
[8524.65s -> 8533.98s]  I need to figure out where more oil is.
[8533.98s -> 8543.82s]  All right hold it.
[8543.82s -> 8545.56s]  I think it's time to hold it.
[8545.56s -> 8557.18s]  All right stop.
[8557.18s -> 8559.23s]  All right stop selling.
[8559.23s -> 8560.59s]  Start storing now.
[8560.59s -> 8561.93s]  Take them out.
[8561.93s -> 8567.32s]  Check over here.
[8567.32s -> 8576.83s]  That might be it.
[8576.83s -> 8579.05s]  See anything?
[8579.05s -> 8581.56s]  It's a lot of wagons.
[8581.56s -> 8582.36s]  Yeah I kind of freaked out.
[8582.36s -> 8583.00s]  It's all right though.
[8583.00s -> 8583.96s]  They're only 150.
[8583.96s -> 8587.21s]  September.
[8587.21s -> 8589.37s]  Okay at the end of October I can start selling.
[8589.37s -> 8596.43s]  76 is a good floor price now don't you think?
[8596.43s -> 8597.55s]  Yeah that's true.
[8597.55s -> 8611.15s]  I wonder how big this is.
[8611.15s -> 8612.19s]  Oh shit.
[8612.19s -> 8612.99s]  That might be it.
[8612.99s -> 8617.29s]  Do I just hold this oil till November?
[8617.29s -> 8619.23s]  Because I don't think there's anything else here.
[8619.23s -> 8626.51s]  I mean I'm gonna check.
[8626.51s -> 8627.23s]  This is it.
[8627.31s -> 8634.78s]  That's it.
[8634.78s -> 8637.79s]  There's nothing else here.
[8637.79s -> 8638.75s]  22 cents over.
[8638.75s -> 8644.41s]  Yeah there's nothing here.
[8644.41s -> 8644.73s]  80.
[8644.73s -> 8645.45s]  Okay November.
[8646.01s -> 8655.63s]  Oh we're gonna get a good price.
[8655.63s -> 8656.03s]  20.
[8656.83s -> 8657.31s]  1.
[8657.31s -> 8658.59s]  25.
[8658.59s -> 8659.71s]  Wait till like 1.
[8659.71s -> 8663.63s]  Okay go go go go.
[8663.63s -> 8664.43s]  It's not coming up.
[8664.43s -> 8670.67s]  All right I'm good.
[8670.67s -> 8674.19s]  That was worth it.
[8674.19s -> 8676.51s]  The $1,000 I would have gotten is not a big deal.
[8676.51s -> 8677.47s]  That was like 10 grand.
[8677.47s -> 8678.35s]  There's nothing else here.
[8678.35s -> 8688.73s]  Another terrible one.
[8688.73s -> 8690.65s]  I keep picking the winners don't I?
[8690.65s -> 8693.56s]  That's sad.
[8704.59s -> 8705.71s]  This doesn't look correct.
[8706.35s -> 8710.28s]  This looks like I'm doing something wrong.
[8710.28s -> 8714.52s]  This looks like a weird food budget list.
[8714.52s -> 8716.44s]  Yeah what are you what are you getting for food?
[8716.44s -> 8719.64s]  Well you know 80% bread.
[8722.40s -> 8727.84s]  And then like a head of lettuce.
[8728.48s -> 8729.84s]  Here's the here's the cabbage.
[8729.84s -> 8731.61s]  There's a cabbage slice.
[8731.61s -> 8738.12s]  There's like a weird food pyramid.
[8743.47s -> 8745.39s]  Maybe I'm spending too much money.
[8745.39s -> 8749.26s]  Can't see the cursor.
[8749.26s -> 8750.48s]  Weird why not?
[8750.48s -> 8752.91s]  Have you guys not been able to see the cursor the whole time?
[8761.13s -> 8771.04s]  What?
[8771.04s -> 8771.92s]  Well that's weird.
[8772.48s -> 8776.86s]  So you were probably guessing what the hell I was doing this whole time.
[8777.42s -> 8781.13s]  There's been no cursor.
[8790.00s -> 8795.85s]  Has there been a point?
[8796.72s -> 8797.84s]  It was fine though okay.
[8798.64s -> 8800.08s]  We weren't even watching dude.
[8808.44s -> 8808.92s]  Okay.
[8808.92s -> 8809.80s]  I have an announcement to make.
[8809.80s -> 8811.48s]  I will soon retire as mayor.
[8811.48s -> 8815.16s]  My successor will be the one who has the most shares of my town.
[8815.16s -> 8819.02s]  Which I will gradually sell at the new stock auction.
[8821.80s -> 8822.44s]  What?
[8822.44s -> 8826.11s]  I'm selling my shares of the town.
[8826.11s -> 8829.39s]  Let's go to the auction and see who takes a step closer to becoming the new mayor.
[8829.39s -> 8837.15s]  Press the start button to start the auction.
[8837.15s -> 8842.03s]  The first one to press the buy button acquires 2% of the town's shares.
[8842.03s -> 8843.61s]  How much are they?
[8843.61s -> 8844.41s]  What do they cost?
[8848.06s -> 8849.42s]  There is it $36,000?
[8850.46s -> 8853.16s]  How much money do I have?
[8853.16s -> 8856.09s]  Okay I have 32,000.
[8859.60s -> 8860.56s]  Is it 36 grand?
[8878.64s -> 8879.92s]  I own this fucking town.
[8879.92s -> 8880.64s]  Let's go.
[8880.64s -> 8885.42s]  Did I pay too much?
[8886.35s -> 8888.43s]  Did I just pay way too much?
[8888.43s -> 8894.64s]  That was for only 2% of the shares?
[8894.64s -> 8902.88s]  That doesn't sound like a good idea now that I think about it.
[8902.88s -> 8908.43s]  I could have waited till like less than 5k probably.
[8908.43s -> 8909.39s]  Oh well.
[8909.39s -> 8915.37s]  Imagine getting 2% of the shares and you think you own the town.
[8919.71s -> 8920.91s]  Well I can't upgrade anything.
[8921.71s -> 8922.75s]  That was really dumb.
[8923.31s -> 8928.06s]  Do I do it again?
[8928.94s -> 8929.18s]  No.
[8929.74s -> 8930.30s]  Okay.
[8930.30s -> 8941.28s]  The town is evaluated at $800,000 so I actually just didn't really do anything.
[8941.28s -> 8945.31s]  I'm gonna hold on to the money.
[8948.84s -> 8953.80s]  Again look at this trash.
[8956.81s -> 8957.93s]  Junk, junk, junk.
[8957.93s -> 8959.37s]  I need something that's not junk.
[8960.89s -> 8962.65s]  These are all bad though.
[8962.65s -> 8966.68s]  I'm just gonna go over here.
[8966.68s -> 8967.98s]  Somebody said near the water.
[8968.70s -> 8974.96s]  Hope you're right.
[8975.68s -> 8986.89s]  Okay.
[8986.89s -> 8988.16s]  Right Inc.
[8988.16s -> 8996.03s]  It'll never go under a dollar.
[8996.03s -> 8997.15s]  That's ridiculous.
[8997.15s -> 8997.79s]  I have to do it.
[8999.76s -> 9000.32s]  Okay.
[9000.32s -> 9003.92s]  So I gotta be ready to sell because it's never going under a buck.
[9003.92s -> 9007.39s]  Let's do it.
[9007.95s -> 9009.66s]  Okay.
[9009.66s -> 9009.98s]  Let's go.
[9009.98s -> 9011.21s]  Hurry up.
[9011.21s -> 9011.77s]  Right Inc.
[9012.57s -> 9014.33s]  I hope it's all on the right side.
[9014.33s -> 9018.83s]  Get a dowser out there too.
[9018.83s -> 9019.79s]  We gotta go now.
[9019.79s -> 9024.04s]  Got something good?
[9024.04s -> 9024.52s]  Alright.
[9024.52s -> 9025.24s]  Let's start.
[9025.24s -> 9054.27s]  Go, go, go.
[9054.27s -> 9054.91s]  Let's go.
[9054.91s -> 9055.55s]  Sell, sell.
[9055.55s -> 9055.95s]  Just do.
[9055.95s -> 9056.51s]  I'm never gonna.
[9056.51s -> 9058.81s]  I'm not gonna even buy a storage unit.
[9058.81s -> 9059.77s]  Why would I?
[9059.77s -> 9061.04s]  Just sell permanently.
[9061.04s -> 9061.84s]  Always sell.
[9061.84s -> 9072.75s]  Where's this guy seeing this oil?
[9092.68s -> 9094.92s]  Move guys.
[9096.24s -> 9133.26s]  Uh, oh boy.
[9133.26s -> 9134.54s]  Oh boy.
[9134.54s -> 9135.18s]  Oh boy.
[9135.18s -> 9138.86s]  Go and buy it and sell it on the market over there.
[9138.86s -> 9147.40s]  Oh shit.
[9147.40s -> 9151.04s]  Oh no.
[9151.76s -> 9158.54s]  Okay.
[9158.54s -> 9158.78s]  What?
[9158.78s -> 9159.58s]  I freaked out.
[9159.58s -> 9170.27s]  I've not seen a single diamond by the way.
[9170.27s -> 9187.08s]  This one was junk too.
[9187.08s -> 9205.88s]  This one was junk too.
[9205.88s -> 9224.27s]  Great.
[9224.27s -> 9225.47s]  I got a dollar.
[9225.47s -> 9238.81s]  You got anything for me here?
[9238.81s -> 9239.85s]  You do got something.
[9239.85s -> 9240.41s]  Finally.
[9240.41s -> 9241.45s]  My God.
[9241.45s -> 9286.40s]  What is going on here?
[9286.40s -> 9287.04s]  Thank you.
[9287.04s -> 9288.24s]  I would never would have seen that.
[9288.24s -> 9292.60s]  What do I get?
[9292.60s -> 9293.32s]  A diamond?
[9293.32s -> 9296.43s]  Got it.
[9296.43s -> 9297.77s]  You picked up a diamond.
[9297.77s -> 9299.13s]  If you're ever short on time,
[9299.13s -> 9300.89s]  use this button to play a little bit longer.
[9300.89s -> 9302.25s]  Exchange for a diamond.
[9302.25s -> 9306.41s]  Okay.
[9306.41s -> 9307.69s]  Well, no, I don't want to do that.
[9326.44s -> 9343.45s]  Dumb face cam.
[9343.45s -> 9346.33s]  Where?
[9346.33s -> 9354.56s]  Can't really go anywhere.
[9354.56s -> 9361.87s]  No, it blocks too much.
[9361.87s -> 9362.51s]  Left of.
[9362.51s -> 9362.99s]  Wait.
[9362.99s -> 9372.12s]  I guess it could go up here.
[9372.12s -> 9372.60s]  Here?
[9372.60s -> 9376.09s]  But then you guys can't see me selling stuff.
[9376.09s -> 9379.20s]  I just don't think I fit anywhere.
[9379.20s -> 9380.24s]  Maybe here?
[9380.24s -> 9382.65s]  I don't fit anywhere.
[9382.65s -> 9389.04s]  No, I don't fit anywhere.
[9389.04s -> 9389.76s]  It's too bad.
[9389.76s -> 9391.98s]  I don't really fit anywhere.
[9391.98s -> 9398.00s]  Put myself right in the middle.
[9398.00s -> 9401.88s]  I could do like here.
[9401.88s -> 9406.30s]  Next to the prices on the right.
[9406.30s -> 9410.22s]  I could just.
[9410.22s -> 9412.22s]  I mean, that's weird.
[9412.22s -> 9415.72s]  This is strange though.
[9415.72s -> 9418.17s]  No, I don't fit anywhere.
[9418.17s -> 9422.68s]  I'm just going to stay down here.
[9422.68s -> 9425.13s]  Oh, I shrunk it.
[9425.13s -> 9426.09s]  I shrunk it a little bit.
[9426.09s -> 9434.35s]  It's not enough oil here.
[9434.35s -> 9437.48s]  I got absolutely just ruined.
[9437.48s -> 9440.57s]  I think it's actually probably empty.
[9440.57s -> 9449.31s]  They're all just crowding this one thing.
[9449.31s -> 9449.63s]  Nice.
[9449.63s -> 9450.51s]  A dollar.
[9450.51s -> 9451.31s]  Fantastic.
[9451.31s -> 9457.90s]  We're in September.
[9457.90s -> 9459.18s]  I think it's empty.
[9459.18s -> 9471.84s]  Carrying nothing here.
[9471.84s -> 9472.88s]  Dowsers not finding anything.
[9472.88s -> 9484.03s]  Did you find anything?
[9484.03s -> 9484.99s]  15k.
[9484.99s -> 9488.60s]  I spent five grand to make it
[9488.60s -> 9492.09s]  so I could sell this shit for $1 each.
[9492.09s -> 9493.13s]  I got a diamond though.
[9493.13s -> 9493.45s]  All right.
[9493.45s -> 9494.57s]  Well, let's just end though.
[9494.57s -> 9507.85s]  How did you not find that?
[9507.85s -> 9510.17s]  He didn't find it.
[9510.17s -> 9515.20s]  Oh, stock auction.
[9539.66s -> 9540.78s]  What the fuck?
[9540.78s -> 9541.82s]  Who got it?
[9541.82s -> 9546.36s]  I clicked it and closed the menu.
[9546.36s -> 9549.13s]  1%.
[9549.13s -> 9551.52s]  Yeah, I got 2%.
[9553.12s -> 9554.80s]  Pound for pound, I spent less than you did.
[9569.50s -> 9578.43s]  I kind of want the scanner.
[9578.43s -> 9579.71s]  No, this is important.
[9579.71s -> 9582.94s]  It's important.
[9582.94s -> 9583.90s]  These things just get in the way.
[9583.90s -> 9584.62s]  I'm buying it.
[9584.62s -> 9589.77s]  What do I do with the diamond again?
[9589.77s -> 9598.38s]  I can give this to somebody, right?
[9598.38s -> 9603.34s]  Diamonds.
[9603.42s -> 9605.74s]  Your diamonds are worth $25.41 a piece.
[9605.74s -> 9606.46s]  Sell me one.
[9606.46s -> 9607.80s]  Get out of here.
[9607.80s -> 9608.20s]  Kidding me.
[9608.20s -> 9610.32s]  It's a solid diamond.
[9610.32s -> 9611.84s]  It's worth like $50,000.
[9611.84s -> 9612.40s]  Get out of here.
[9612.40s -> 9619.76s]  Looking for a piece of land with lots of oil.
[9619.76s -> 9621.12s]  Give me one of your shiny diamonds
[9621.12s -> 9622.16s]  and I'll point it out.
[9622.16s -> 9624.44s]  Is this guy a liar?
[9624.44s -> 9625.40s]  I also don't have...
[9625.40s -> 9626.52s]  I'm not doing this yet.
[9626.52s -> 9635.93s]  I don't have enough money.
[9635.93s -> 9636.89s]  Yeah, I'm not going to do that
[9636.89s -> 9640.25s]  because if I do that right now,
[9640.25s -> 9641.45s]  I only have 7k to work with.
[9641.45s -> 9642.49s]  I need 2k.
[9642.49s -> 9644.38s]  So I only have 5k to work with
[9644.38s -> 9647.23s]  if somebody wants to outbid me.
[9647.23s -> 9648.83s]  Does Mary have any more tips?
[9648.83s -> 9654.33s]  If a dowser with all the depth upgrades
[9654.33s -> 9655.45s]  walks out of the screen,
[9655.45s -> 9657.29s]  it means that there are no more
[9657.29s -> 9661.23s]  new untapped oil pockets in the ground.
[9661.23s -> 9662.75s]  Well, so that was the problem.
[9662.75s -> 9666.75s]  If you're running out of silo space,
[9666.75s -> 9667.71s]  don't forget you can also use
[9667.71s -> 9669.31s]  your wagons to store oil.
[9669.31s -> 9670.83s]  Yeah, I mean, I've been doing that.
[9670.83s -> 9673.80s]  Drilling around rocks can be cheaper
[9673.80s -> 9675.56s]  than spending money on the rig upgrade.
[9675.56s -> 9677.15s]  Keep in mind, however, that
[9677.15s -> 9679.55s]  longer pipelines are more expensive to upgrade.
[9679.55s -> 9684.04s]  Yeah, judging by the pie chart
[9684.04s -> 9685.40s]  that we all looked at.
[9685.40s -> 9688.09s]  Connecting pipes from an upgraded rig
[9688.09s -> 9689.85s]  to pipes from a non-upgraded rig
[9689.85s -> 9690.97s]  will copy...
[9690.97s -> 9691.61s]  Wait a minute.
[9691.69s -> 9701.34s]  Will copy all the upgrades to the new network.
[9701.34s -> 9702.46s]  Wait, hold on.
[9702.46s -> 9706.70s]  So if I just connect to this,
[9706.70s -> 9707.58s]  I don't have to buy that.
[9712.81s -> 9714.65s]  But you have to go a long way for that, though.
[9714.65s -> 9715.13s]  This is...
[9715.13s -> 9717.82s]  OK, going from here to here
[9717.82s -> 9720.62s]  is probably like six or seven hundred dollars.
[9720.62s -> 9724.08s]  How much would it be to upgrade this?
[9724.08s -> 9725.04s]  Three or four hundred?
[9725.04s -> 9731.95s]  It's probably cheaper than
[9731.95s -> 9733.15s]  buying the drill rig.
[9733.15s -> 9733.95s]  Probably.
[9733.95s -> 9736.51s]  Well, I'll keep that in mind.
[9736.51s -> 9737.55s]  Cancel the scan in progress
[9737.55s -> 9738.83s]  by clicking anywhere above ground
[9738.83s -> 9740.67s]  or just click the right mouse button.
[9740.67s -> 9742.49s]  Good to know.
[9742.49s -> 9747.02s]  Actually, pretty useful stuff.
[9747.02s -> 9749.85s]  OK, I should probably eat.
[9751.05s -> 9751.93s]  OK, I'm going to do one more.
[9751.93s -> 9753.28s]  Here's what we're going to do.
[9753.28s -> 9754.56s]  I'm going to do one more day.
[9754.56s -> 9757.24s]  So I'm going to do one more day
[9757.24s -> 9758.60s]  and then I'm going to go eat
[9758.60s -> 9759.48s]  and I'm coming back.
[9759.48s -> 9772.04s]  I need to eat something.
[9772.04s -> 9772.84s]  Well, hold on.
[9772.84s -> 9777.66s]  I have a question.
[9777.66s -> 9778.22s]  Question.
[9778.22s -> 9781.18s]  Would you rather...
[9781.18s -> 9784.22s]  Let's do a poll.
[9784.22s -> 9790.96s]  Would you rather me just to keep streaming
[9790.96s -> 9792.24s]  all the way for like
[9792.24s -> 9794.56s]  at least another couple of hours, at least?
[9794.56s -> 9796.04s]  Another like two or three hours.
[9796.04s -> 9796.76s]  Let's say like...
[9796.76s -> 9798.86s]  Let's say at least 10 hours.
[9798.86s -> 9800.73s]  10 to 12 hours.
[9800.73s -> 9804.09s]  Or would you rather we stop now
[9804.09s -> 9806.01s]  and pick it up tomorrow afternoon
[9806.01s -> 9808.46s]  and go again?
[9808.46s -> 9809.18s]  Like, would you rather have
[9809.18s -> 9811.02s]  like a 12 hour stream tonight
[9811.02s -> 9811.82s]  or would you rather have
[9811.82s -> 9814.14s]  like two six to eight hour streams
[9814.14s -> 9815.18s]  two days in a row?
[9815.18s -> 9824.22s]  So this is...
[9824.22s -> 9825.50s]  I mean, this is Omega Weekend.
[9825.50s -> 9829.74s]  Should we do 12 hours tonight?
[9829.74s -> 9832.08s]  And then I won't be live tomorrow
[9832.08s -> 9834.44s]  because that would mean
[9834.44s -> 9836.20s]  I probably would go until like
[9836.20s -> 9837.88s]  two plus o'clock in the morning.
[9837.88s -> 9839.34s]  And I definitely would...
[9839.34s -> 9840.54s]  If I would stream tomorrow
[9840.54s -> 9842.22s]  would be like in the afternoon.
[9842.22s -> 9857.68s]  What do you think?
[9857.68s -> 9858.96s]  Do tomorrow. OK.
[9858.96s -> 9867.15s]  I'm going to...
[9867.15s -> 9868.67s]  I want to play this more though.
[9868.67s -> 9872.67s]  Don't burn out.
[9872.67s -> 9873.23s]  I won't burn out.
[9873.23s -> 9873.71s]  I'll be all right.
[9874.51s -> 9875.71s]  I want to play this.
[9875.71s -> 9892.97s]  All right.
[9892.97s -> 9894.17s]  So here's what we're going to do.
[9894.17s -> 9895.45s]  It looks like it's pretty much...
[9895.45s -> 9897.48s]  It's decided.
[9897.48s -> 9900.12s]  I am going to do one more day here.
[9900.12s -> 9902.89s]  So I'm going to do another day.
[9902.89s -> 9906.78s]  And then we're going to start
[9906.78s -> 9908.22s]  with this tomorrow.
[9908.22s -> 9911.32s]  How much longer is the desert?
[9911.32s -> 9916.76s]  But what if I want to go?
[9916.76s -> 9918.12s]  What if we just go, man?
[9918.12s -> 9923.12s]  You know what I mean?
[9923.12s -> 9924.24s]  What if we just go?
[9924.24s -> 9924.96s]  And like, fuck it.
[9924.96s -> 9925.36s]  Who cares?
[9925.36s -> 9926.48s]  And let's just like go for like
[9926.48s -> 9934.08s]  15 hours or something.
[9934.08s -> 9934.72s]  Is that crazy?
[9934.72s -> 9935.36s]  Should I not do that?
[9936.00s -> 9937.07s]  OK.
[9937.07s -> 9938.40s]  Hey.
[9938.40s -> 9939.36s]  Hey.
[9939.36s -> 9940.00s]  Hey.
[9940.00s -> 9941.20s]  Hey, you over there.
[9941.20s -> 9949.23s]  Guess what?
[9949.23s -> 9950.11s]  Should I go?
[9950.11s -> 9951.63s]  I want to keep playing though.
[9951.63s -> 9952.83s]  But I don't want to...
[9952.83s -> 9956.94s]  It's been like almost nine hours.
[9957.26s -> 9963.76s]  It is Omega Weekend.
[9963.76s -> 9965.15s]  I'm staying.
[9965.15s -> 9966.51s]  I'm not going anywhere.
[9966.51s -> 9967.63s]  I'm staying.
[9967.63s -> 9968.91s]  I'm going to go eat some food.
[9968.91s -> 9969.55s]  I'm coming back.
[9969.55s -> 9971.23s]  And this may be...
[9971.23s -> 9972.43s]  I'm just going to make it...
[9972.43s -> 9974.44s]  This could be...
[9974.44s -> 9975.80s]  This is Omega Weekend.
[9975.80s -> 9979.12s]  Can we stop on Omega...
[9979.12s -> 9980.16s]  Oh, it's Omega Weekend.
[9980.16s -> 9981.28s]  Let me stop.
[9981.28s -> 9983.44s]  You stop on Omega Gaming Weekend?
[9983.44s -> 9986.08s]  I don't think so.
[9986.08s -> 9987.12s]  I'm going to keep playing this.
[9987.12s -> 9988.32s]  I'm going to keep going as long...
[9988.32s -> 9989.44s]  Because I still want to play this.
[9989.44s -> 9990.24s]  I'm still really into this.
[9990.24s -> 9992.16s]  I think I'm having a great time.
[9992.16s -> 9993.68s]  So like, oh, I'm going to leave.
[9993.68s -> 9995.04s]  And all I'm going to be doing
[9995.04s -> 9995.84s]  when I'm sitting there eating
[9995.84s -> 9997.32s]  is just going...
[9997.32s -> 9999.53s]  I want to play that fucking oil game.
[9999.53s -> 10000.09s]  Right now.
[10000.09s -> 10004.09s]  I'll be right back.
[10004.09s -> 10005.64s]  I'll be right back.
[10005.64s -> 10007.40s]  I'm going to eat a little bit of food.
[10007.40s -> 10008.28s]  Get some water.
[10008.28s -> 10009.95s]  Stretch a little bit.
[10009.95s -> 10010.51s]  And I'm coming back.
[10010.51s -> 10011.55s]  We're going to at least finish the desert.
[10011.55s -> 10012.83s]  We're going to finish the desert at least.
[10019.64s -> 10021.16s]  You should refund those points.
[10023.12s -> 10023.68s]  Oh, yeah.
[10023.68s -> 10026.16s]  Turn off the channel points to re-vote again.
[10031.13s -> 10034.17s]  Yeah, because people are spending their channel points.
[10034.17s -> 10034.41s]  All right.
[10034.41s -> 10035.37s]  Here we go.
[10035.37s -> 10036.49s]  Let's plan this out.
[10036.49s -> 10038.33s]  I'm going to at least beat the desert tonight.
[10038.89s -> 10041.60s]  Can somebody tell me what my longest dream ever was?
[10041.60s -> 10042.48s]  What was it?
[10042.48s -> 10044.35s]  What was the longest dream ever?
[10044.35s -> 10046.70s]  You thought I was fucking around when I said I'd make a weekend.
[10046.70s -> 10048.14s]  I just want to prove this to you guys.
[10048.14s -> 10049.98s]  What's the longest dream I've ever done?
[10049.98s -> 10051.44s]  Was it 12 hours?
[10051.44s -> 10060.92s]  We're beating that record tonight.
[10060.92s -> 10062.11s]  I'll be right back.
[10062.11s -> 10063.47s]  I'm going to eat and stretch.
[10063.47s -> 10065.36s]  This is going to be the longest dream I've ever done.
[10065.36s -> 10066.08s]  I can already feel it.
[10066.08s -> 10066.88s]  I'm telling you right now.
[10066.88s -> 10069.36s]  This is going to be the longest dream I've ever done.
[10069.36s -> 10070.16s]  Stamp it.
[10070.16s -> 10070.72s]  I'll be right back.
[10075.58s -> 10078.38s]  I want the exact time that Lord of the Rings was
[10078.38s -> 10080.06s]  because I'm beating that shit tonight.
[10080.06s -> 10081.53s]  That will be...
[10081.53s -> 10081.93s]  Wait, hold on.
[10081.93s -> 10082.33s]  That will be...
[10082.33s -> 10082.97s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[10082.97s -> 10083.90s]  All right.
[10083.90s -> 10084.14s]  Wait.
[10084.14s -> 10085.98s]  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[10086.92s -> 10090.44s]  That would be 9, 10, 11, 12, 12.
[10090.44s -> 10091.72s]  Oh, we can fucking do this.
[10092.80s -> 10093.84s]  We can do this.
[10093.84s -> 10094.56s]  I'm going for it.
[10096.44s -> 10097.72s]  I feel great, by the way.
[10097.72s -> 10098.92s]  It's not like I feel okay.
[10099.48s -> 10102.08s]  I'll be right back.
[11084.54s -> 11087.48s]  So I didn't eat yet.
[11089.60s -> 11093.00s]  I'm having food is being put in the oven.
[11095.90s -> 11098.57s]  I did jog in a circle.
[11098.57s -> 11099.45s]  I peed.
[11099.45s -> 11101.93s]  I refilled my tea here.
[11103.34s -> 11104.22s]  Got a bunch of water.
[11107.48s -> 11108.28s]  I did zoomies.
[11108.28s -> 11109.96s]  I did the thing the dogs do.
[11109.96s -> 11111.00s]  I literally ran in a circle.
[11111.72s -> 11112.60s]  I'm kind of out of breath.
[11114.91s -> 11117.31s]  If you're going to sit down for like 15 hours
[11117.31s -> 11118.67s]  or like 14 hours or something,
[11119.96s -> 11121.00s]  you've got to get up and move.
[11121.95s -> 11122.59s]  Eventually.
[11126.43s -> 11127.95s]  Just microwave your food.
[11129.15s -> 11129.79s]  Well, no.
[11130.91s -> 11133.71s]  Holly is making French bread pizzas.
[11135.12s -> 11137.36s]  So I don't want to...
[11137.36s -> 11139.44s]  You don't want to put the French bread pizza in the microwave.
[11139.44s -> 11145.18s]  I don't rather be in the toaster or the oven or something.
[11145.18s -> 11145.68s]  All right.
[11146.30s -> 11148.97s]  Yeah, there's other stuff too,
[11148.97s -> 11151.61s]  but I think that's the fastest thing to make.
[11151.61s -> 11154.64s]  So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[11157.88s -> 11158.20s]  Okay.
[11161.07s -> 11163.31s]  I ran in a circle for like five minutes
[11163.31s -> 11165.31s]  and I may have tired myself out for the stream.
[11166.64s -> 11167.60s]  Wow, that was a mistake.
[11167.60s -> 11169.72s]  Why did I think that was a good idea?
[11169.72s -> 11170.44s]  Oh yeah, dude.
[11170.44s -> 11173.08s]  I've been streaming for like nine hours.
[11173.08s -> 11173.64s]  Oh yeah.
[11173.64s -> 11177.31s]  Let me get up and run in a circle for five minutes.
[11177.31s -> 11178.19s]  I'm kidding.
[11178.19s -> 11178.75s]  Don't worry.
[11178.75s -> 11180.86s]  I'm just kidding.
[11180.86s -> 11181.10s]  Okay.
[11182.06s -> 11182.54s]  Yes.
[11182.54s -> 11182.86s]  Okay.
[11183.82s -> 11184.14s]  I got...
[11184.14s -> 11186.46s]  If there's ever a time that I'm going to break that,
[11186.46s -> 11187.02s]  like what?
[11187.02s -> 11188.62s]  12 hours, 13 hours?
[11188.62s -> 11191.26s]  It's going to be right now.
[11191.26s -> 11193.18s]  There ain't no fucking way I ain't going to do it.
[11193.18s -> 11196.00s]  Unless I shit my pants,
[11196.00s -> 11197.20s]  which I would just stay here.
[11197.20s -> 11198.88s]  I wouldn't leave and I wouldn't tell you.
[11198.88s -> 11201.48s]  All right.
[11201.48s -> 11202.84s]  Are you still streaming tomorrow?
[11202.84s -> 11204.04s]  That is a great question.
[11204.04s -> 11206.46s]  If I cross 14 plus hours
[11206.46s -> 11208.46s]  and it's like three o'clock in the morning Pacific,
[11208.46s -> 11208.86s]  I don't...
[11208.86s -> 11214.52s]  I'm going to say probably not on Saturday.
[11214.52s -> 11215.00s]  We'll see.
[11221.90s -> 11222.46s]  Okay.
[11222.46s -> 11234.67s]  Play Diablo 2.
[11234.67s -> 11235.95s]  It's my birthday.
[11236.78s -> 11238.30s]  You lied about Omega Weekend.
[11239.29s -> 11240.33s]  Hold on here.
[11240.33s -> 11241.69s]  Hold on here.
[11241.69s -> 11243.71s]  Wait just a second.
[11243.71s -> 11247.71s]  Where everybody gets a little annoyed with me.
[11247.71s -> 11249.23s]  Omega Weekend.
[11249.23s -> 11250.19s]  Omega Weekend.
[11250.19s -> 11254.36s]  I'm about to break the longest stream I've ever done ever.
[11254.92s -> 11256.28s]  I think that's Omega Weekend.
[11256.28s -> 11258.49s]  That's Omega Friday.
[11258.49s -> 11259.93s]  That's an Omega stream.
[11259.93s -> 11261.21s]  That's Omega Weekend.
[11265.76s -> 11266.40s]  We'll see.
[11266.40s -> 11272.11s]  If I get up tomorrow, I'll be fine.
[11272.11s -> 11274.11s]  Omega Friday equals Omega Weekend.
[11274.11s -> 11275.88s]  Well, hold on.
[11275.88s -> 11277.48s]  I'm technically...
[11277.48s -> 11279.40s]  I will be technically streaming on Saturday
[11279.40s -> 11280.76s]  for like three or four hours.
[11280.76s -> 11284.20s]  Excuse me?
[11284.20s -> 11285.00s]  Omega Friday?
[11291.13s -> 11292.41s]  Omega...
[11292.41s -> 11294.01s]  Omega Weekend.
[11294.57s -> 11302.09s]  But hold on.
[11302.09s -> 11304.25s]  Let's go over this really quickly.
[11304.25s -> 11304.81s]  We're going to chill.
[11304.81s -> 11305.53s]  This is going to be a chill.
[11305.53s -> 11306.17s]  Like it's getting late
[11306.17s -> 11307.29s]  and I don't want to be like loud
[11307.29s -> 11308.25s]  and screaming at people and stuff.
[11308.25s -> 11308.97s]  But I don't know what to mean.
[11308.97s -> 11310.17s]  We might play something else a little bit.
[11311.68s -> 11314.81s]  A typical stream that I do,
[11314.81s -> 11317.52s]  forget that it's Omega Weekend,
[11318.08s -> 11318.56s]  is what?
[11318.56s -> 11320.24s]  Between five and seven hours?
[11320.24s -> 11323.90s]  Seven and seven is 14.
[11323.90s -> 11325.98s]  That's like streaming seven hours on Friday,
[11325.98s -> 11328.00s]  seven hours on Saturday,
[11328.00s -> 11330.80s]  and then an extra epilogue stream on Sunday
[11330.80s -> 11333.12s]  to like just smoke a bowl and hang out.
[11333.12s -> 11336.62s]  It's not happening, by the way.
[11336.62s -> 11337.26s]  Semantics.
[11345.64s -> 11346.28s]  All right, let's play.
[11346.28s -> 11346.68s]  Let's play.
[11347.64s -> 11348.28s]  I'm having a lot of fun.
[11348.28s -> 11349.08s]  This game is fucking awesome.
[11349.08s -> 11350.36s]  Did this game come out this year?
[11350.36s -> 11353.71s]  Did this game come out in 2022?
[11353.71s -> 11354.91s]  Because it's like this is
[11354.91s -> 11357.44s]  one of my favorite games that came out.
[11357.44s -> 11358.16s]  This is great.
[11358.16s -> 11359.04s]  I love this.
[11359.04s -> 11359.92s]  Came out last year.
[11359.92s -> 11360.48s]  Oh, shit.
[11360.48s -> 11360.96s]  Well, whatever.
[11360.96s -> 11361.20s]  All right.
[11361.20s -> 11362.00s]  I'm going to go over here.
[11367.53s -> 11368.57s]  Pretty slim at the moment.
[11369.84s -> 11370.40s]  Pretty slim.
[11371.34s -> 11371.82s]  I'm going to stay here.
[11372.54s -> 11377.56s]  It was early access in 2016.
[11378.20s -> 11378.52s]  Really?
[11379.93s -> 11380.25s]  Damn.
[11380.81s -> 11381.05s]  Okay.
[11386.20s -> 11397.47s]  Damn.
[11397.47s -> 11398.11s]  Geez.
[11400.76s -> 11401.64s]  Okay.
[11401.64s -> 11407.39s]  Okay, let's go.
[11407.39s -> 11413.76s]  What are your thoughts on Internet
[11413.76s -> 11415.28s]  raising their double double price?
[11415.28s -> 11416.24s]  Well, you're eating it in and out.
[11416.24s -> 11417.12s]  That was the first mistake.
[11432.38s -> 11432.86s]  Okay.
[11432.86s -> 11434.46s]  Can upgrade silos twice?
[11434.46s -> 11436.91s]  How do you go?
[11436.91s -> 11437.39s]  Okay.
[11437.39s -> 11438.43s]  For the audio levels?
[11441.12s -> 11443.36s]  I mean, we're getting to the later hours, right?
[11443.36s -> 11445.88s]  Should we have like not the loud,
[11445.88s -> 11448.12s]  like, you know, the music,
[11448.68s -> 11449.64s]  the sounds in the background?
[11449.64s -> 11450.60s]  What do you guys think?
[11450.60s -> 11454.11s]  I just feel we should probably lower the lights here, too.
[11454.11s -> 11454.99s]  Don't you think?
[11454.99s -> 11457.00s]  Is it okay?
[11457.72s -> 11461.24s]  These kind of don't don't don't don't don't sounds.
[11461.24s -> 11466.96s]  You okay with these candles?
[11467.52s -> 11468.32s]  Candles?
[11468.32s -> 11472.56s]  Turn it down a little.
[11472.56s -> 11472.88s]  Okay.
[11472.88s -> 11473.92s]  Yeah, I think that's okay.
[11474.56s -> 11476.24s]  That's that's really good right there.
[11476.24s -> 11478.44s]  Get the nice music, the ambient sounds.
[11478.44s -> 11479.32s]  I think that you are.
[11479.32s -> 11479.72s]  All right.
[11479.72s -> 11481.84s]  Yeah, let me get let me turn lights off.
[11492.86s -> 11498.56s]  Oh, is that the better?
[11498.56s -> 11502.36s]  Although I'm kind of like low FPS, aren't I?
[11503.00s -> 11509.39s]  It's okay.
[11509.39s -> 11511.95s]  It's doing automatic gain adjustment.
[11512.75s -> 11520.25s]  So the lower I that's annoying.
[11520.25s -> 11520.97s]  Hold on.
[11520.97s -> 11533.02s]  Is that comfy or is that scary?
[11533.90s -> 11549.84s]  It's too scary.
[11549.84s -> 11550.72s]  Well, fuck.
[11550.72s -> 11564.16s]  Never mind.
[11564.16s -> 11565.20s]  I tried.
[11565.20s -> 11576.68s]  I tried.
[11576.68s -> 11583.68s]  Oh, well, that looks so that's okay.
[11583.68s -> 11584.56s]  That's fine.
[11584.56s -> 11594.94s]  Here's a little weird, though.
[11594.94s -> 11596.38s]  Wait, I think I know what I can do.
[11598.14s -> 11600.54s]  Oh, I can do this.
[11602.11s -> 11619.02s]  This one is called hearth.
[11619.02s -> 11636.86s]  No, this looks better.
[11636.86s -> 11638.56s]  A little darker.
[11638.56s -> 11646.88s]  That looks that's comfier.
[11646.88s -> 11648.48s]  Yeah, that's that's much comfier.
[11648.48s -> 11657.04s]  That feels better.
[11657.04s -> 11658.40s]  My face is like flickering.
[11658.40s -> 11662.25s]  The camera is so bad.
[11662.25s -> 11666.54s]  I haven't said what this camera is because, I mean, why?
[11666.54s -> 11667.50s]  I don't really care that much.
[11667.50s -> 11668.94s]  But like this thing sucks.
[11669.93s -> 11671.13s]  It genuinely sucks.
[11671.69s -> 11672.33s]  It sucks.
[11672.89s -> 11676.94s]  It's because it's too cropped.
[11683.42s -> 11687.76s]  I don't really want to say what camera this is, but it sucks.
[11687.76s -> 11695.44s]  I just play the other camera and it doesn't matter.
[11695.44s -> 11701.02s]  I know I'm stalling really bad.
[11701.02s -> 11710.75s]  I don't mind if I do this still flickering.
[11710.75s -> 11712.81s]  Why is it flickering?
[11712.81s -> 11718.75s]  I don't get this.
[11718.91s -> 11729.18s]  Tons of flicker.
[11729.18s -> 11730.22s]  This game sucks.
[11730.22s -> 11732.22s]  Stop cropping it and do the zoom instead.
[11732.22s -> 11737.21s]  What do you mean?
[11737.21s -> 11741.64s]  Zoom?
[11741.64s -> 11742.60s]  Do two cameras.
[11746.68s -> 11747.72s]  Oh, fuck.
[11747.72s -> 11748.20s]  Hold on.
[11748.76s -> 11749.80s]  Don't make me do this.
[11750.70s -> 11753.18s]  That's so dumb.
[11753.18s -> 11754.46s]  No, it's too late for this.
[11754.46s -> 11755.42s]  It's too late for this.
[11755.42s -> 11756.06s]  I'm just going to go.
[11757.48s -> 11759.88s]  It's far too late for this.
[11759.88s -> 11764.09s]  Let me turn this.
[11764.09s -> 11769.63s]  This is going to help.
[11769.63s -> 11770.11s]  There it is.
[11770.11s -> 11771.47s]  Not there.
[11771.47s -> 11772.43s]  It's not flickering anymore.
[11772.99s -> 11775.76s]  The better.
[11778.11s -> 11779.15s]  I don't see the flicker anymore.
[11779.71s -> 11783.48s]  I mean, maybe a little.
[11783.48s -> 11792.83s]  For zoom game.
[11794.27s -> 11794.51s]  All right.
[11794.51s -> 11795.15s]  So let's do it.
[11795.15s -> 11797.39s]  So this is the new year.
[11797.95s -> 11799.56s]  What did I just upgrade?
[11799.56s -> 11800.68s]  I just upgraded something, didn't I?
[11804.03s -> 11806.49s]  Welcome to the cozy string.
[11807.21s -> 11810.11s]  We need two.
[11810.11s -> 11816.12s]  Got some of that right here already.
[11816.12s -> 11822.94s]  I'm going to go this way and then maybe that way too.
[11822.94s -> 11824.46s]  Let's get a mole over there just to make sure.
[11825.02s -> 11834.20s]  Looks like everything is on the right side.
[11844.41s -> 11846.09s]  I spent a thousand dollars on moles.
[11846.09s -> 11846.97s]  I know, but it's all right.
[11850.35s -> 11851.66s]  Should I?
[11851.66s -> 11852.54s]  I'm going to.
[11852.54s -> 11853.88s]  It's going to overflow, isn't it?
[11854.44s -> 11869.37s]  All right, we're good.
[11869.37s -> 11869.93s]  Okay.
[11869.93s -> 11874.11s]  So now let's build one here.
[11874.11s -> 11875.63s]  And I'm going to do the connect thing, right?
[11876.35s -> 11884.09s]  If I go like this and then I eventually connect these two.
[11884.09s -> 11887.16s]  Sell left.
[11887.16s -> 11889.64s]  I can't sell left 95, 98.
[11889.64s -> 11890.44s]  We're good.
[11890.44s -> 11896.86s]  I'm going to do silo right here.
[11896.86s -> 11899.72s]  That makes sense to me.
[11901.15s -> 11901.63s]  There we go.
[11902.19s -> 11908.04s]  Sell right, sell right, sell right.
[11908.04s -> 11908.60s]  Okay.
[11908.60s -> 11910.12s]  I need more.
[11910.12s -> 11911.56s]  It's time to upgrade.
[11911.56s -> 11913.56s]  This is where it gets scary.
[11913.56s -> 11916.41s]  I'm going to have at least five horses.
[11916.97s -> 11918.73s]  Be prepared to sell right.
[11922.72s -> 11923.76s]  There's so much here.
[11923.76s -> 11924.00s]  All right.
[11924.00s -> 11928.08s]  So now I'm going to keep moving this over here.
[11928.08s -> 11929.28s]  We're going to double drain this.
[11929.28s -> 11932.56s]  I'm going to split this guy this way.
[11932.56s -> 11933.60s]  Yes, we are.
[11933.60s -> 11934.80s]  We're going to split you this way.
[11937.28s -> 11938.56s]  I'm going to upgrade this.
[11942.76s -> 11945.66s]  Is that do I want to do that?
[11945.66s -> 11947.36s]  All right, question.
[11947.36s -> 11948.96s]  If I connected this to this,
[11951.10s -> 11952.62s]  is this going to become one pipe
[11952.62s -> 11961.16s]  or will they still be draining from here?
[11961.16s -> 11968.62s]  You just said yes.
[11968.62s -> 11969.42s]  Don't connect.
[11969.42s -> 11980.41s]  I'm going to need some more horses in a second.
[11980.41s -> 11981.71s]  Actually, no, I don't.
[11981.71s -> 11983.87s]  I keep buying a horse Andy over here.
[11983.87s -> 11984.35s]  Seriously.
[11991.93s -> 11992.57s]  All right.
[11992.57s -> 11992.97s]  Hold up.
[11993.53s -> 11996.80s]  All right.
[11996.80s -> 11998.40s]  There's a lot coming out of here right now.
[11998.40s -> 11999.84s]  I actually think I'm going to need more horses.
[12000.40s -> 12004.32s]  So far so good.
[12006.41s -> 12015.44s]  Mole action over here on the left.
[12015.44s -> 12015.76s]  Don't.
[12016.32s -> 12016.64s]  Okay.
[12016.64s -> 12017.20s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[12017.20s -> 12018.24s]  Let's do another one here.
[12021.45s -> 12030.80s]  Hold, hold, hold.
[12030.80s -> 12039.68s]  I really want this left side to be better.
[12044.56s -> 12045.28s]  Hold it.
[12045.28s -> 12046.04s]  I'm not.
[12046.04s -> 12046.84s]  No, hold it.
[12046.84s -> 12047.72s]  Seriously.
[12047.72s -> 12049.53s]  This is going to go to like...
[12049.53s -> 12050.17s]  This is going to come down.
[12050.17s -> 12051.45s]  This is going to go to like a dollar fifty.
[12052.01s -> 12053.26s]  All right.
[12053.26s -> 12053.90s]  This one here.
[12054.78s -> 12062.62s]  We're not going to money it.
[12062.62s -> 12062.94s]  Okay.
[12062.94s -> 12063.26s]  All right.
[12063.26s -> 12063.74s]  We got to do it.
[12063.74s -> 12064.38s]  Wait, I got to sell.
[12064.38s -> 12064.78s]  We got to go.
[12064.78s -> 12066.38s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go before it goes down.
[12073.37s -> 12074.09s]  Don't spill.
[12074.91s -> 12075.71s]  Okay.
[12075.71s -> 12078.78s]  Right side.
[12078.78s -> 12079.18s]  Right side.
[12079.18s -> 12079.66s]  Right side.
[12079.66s -> 12080.14s]  No, no, no.
[12080.14s -> 12081.02s]  Hold it.
[12081.02s -> 12085.82s]  Oh, my God.
[12085.82s -> 12086.86s]  There's no oil coming out.
[12086.86s -> 12087.42s]  Oh, shit.
[12087.42s -> 12087.58s]  Okay.
[12087.58s -> 12088.06s]  What do I do?
[12089.52s -> 12093.88s]  This way.
[12093.88s -> 12094.52s]  Hold that.
[12094.52s -> 12095.08s]  Check this out.
[12100.78s -> 12101.82s]  Connect this.
[12101.82s -> 12103.58s]  This is level three shit.
[12104.30s -> 12104.62s]  Right?
[12106.89s -> 12108.01s]  So that is going to do it.
[12108.73s -> 12110.49s]  Did that work?
[12111.13s -> 12113.21s]  Dollar fifteen.
[12113.21s -> 12114.25s]  I'm not doing it.
[12114.25s -> 12115.26s]  Did that not work?
[12117.50s -> 12117.82s]  What?
[12117.82s -> 12119.90s]  Isn't this going to upgrade everything to level three?
[12119.90s -> 12120.22s]  Am I?
[12120.22s -> 12121.58s]  Is that not how that works?
[12121.58s -> 12124.06s]  Sell.
[12124.06s -> 12124.62s]  Not yet.
[12124.62s -> 12125.10s]  Not yet.
[12125.10s -> 12125.42s]  Hold it.
[12128.70s -> 12130.38s]  Is it going to go to like one forty?
[12130.38s -> 12135.32s]  That didn't work.
[12135.32s -> 12136.28s]  One twenty nine.
[12137.92s -> 12138.88s]  One thirty.
[12138.88s -> 12141.56s]  One thirty one.
[12142.12s -> 12145.87s]  Thirty two.
[12150.73s -> 12151.69s]  Thirty three.
[12155.39s -> 12156.19s]  One thirty.
[12162.84s -> 12164.67s]  Yeah, that's good.
[12165.39s -> 12166.11s]  All right.
[12166.11s -> 12167.31s]  You can keep going right.
[12167.31s -> 12170.06s]  I want to go left now.
[12170.06s -> 12177.72s]  Let's have like a few of you be delivering.
[12177.72s -> 12180.38s]  All right.
[12180.38s -> 12181.95s]  I need some.
[12181.95s -> 12182.99s]  Did you look?
[12182.99s -> 12183.87s]  Are you seeing this?
[12183.87s -> 12187.00s]  Moles out.
[12187.00s -> 12192.28s]  I feel like this one sucks ass too.
[12192.28s -> 12202.30s]  Unfortunately, there's nothing on the left side.
[12202.30s -> 12202.86s]  That might be it.
[12204.96s -> 12210.51s]  I think that actually is it.
[12210.51s -> 12211.07s]  Ember.
[12211.07s -> 12212.92s]  I think that might be it.
[12212.92s -> 12214.36s]  Maybe check here.
[12214.36s -> 12217.61s]  What do you think?
[12217.61s -> 12218.09s]  Left.
[12218.09s -> 12221.72s]  Somewhere in the middle.
[12221.72s -> 12221.96s]  All right.
[12222.76s -> 12228.08s]  I'm spending a lot of money on moles.
[12228.08s -> 12229.12s]  Holy shit.
[12229.12s -> 12229.95s]  What was that?
[12229.95s -> 12230.83s]  Did I get a diamond?
[12230.83s -> 12231.63s]  I got a diamond.
[12231.63s -> 12232.83s]  So who found a diamond?
[12232.83s -> 12239.72s]  That's probably it though.
[12239.72s -> 12245.02s]  OK.
[12245.02s -> 12248.84s]  November.
[12248.84s -> 12250.20s]  Check over here.
[12250.20s -> 12251.08s]  Get a couple right.
[12251.08s -> 12251.32s]  OK.
[12251.32s -> 12252.04s]  That's it.
[12252.04s -> 12256.65s]  Sell on the right.
[12256.65s -> 12257.29s]  Final month.
[12257.29s -> 12259.56s]  That's it.
[12259.56s -> 12260.84s]  Oh, this is this is done.
[12260.84s -> 12262.78s]  This is done.
[12262.78s -> 12263.58s]  That's it.
[12263.58s -> 12264.30s]  Oh shit.
[12264.30s -> 12265.10s]  Doesn't matter.
[12265.10s -> 12267.21s]  Well, it's OK.
[12267.29s -> 12268.17s]  Pop middle.
[12268.17s -> 12274.88s]  I didn't even see it.
[12274.88s -> 12276.40s]  Oh, really?
[12276.40s -> 12280.86s]  It's OK.
[12280.86s -> 12283.63s]  I'll take 20 grand.
[12283.63s -> 12287.55s]  He's still streaming.
[12287.55s -> 12287.87s]  Yep.
[12287.87s -> 12290.19s]  If you are just if you're joining us for the first time
[12290.19s -> 12291.79s]  or you're joining us back from earlier,
[12293.48s -> 12295.08s]  the dude was waving you down.
[12295.08s -> 12297.80s]  Yeah, but I thought he was seeing the one I was already tapped into.
[12299.39s -> 12304.43s]  The longest stream I've ever done was...
[12304.43s -> 12305.87s]  Does anyone know the exact number?
[12305.87s -> 12311.23s]  I got two diamonds.
[12311.23s -> 12314.51s]  13 hours and four minutes and 13 hours, four minutes, 32 seconds.
[12316.54s -> 12320.03s]  If you're joining us, I'm going to break that tonight.
[12320.03s -> 12320.99s]  I'm going to...
[12321.71s -> 12323.47s]  This is going to be...
[12323.47s -> 12328.64s]  I'm breaking that longest stream ever in seven years.
[12328.64s -> 12329.68s]  I don't really do...
[12329.68s -> 12332.00s]  And then people go, what do you do a 13 hour stream?
[12333.31s -> 12335.39s]  That's really like in the grand scheme of things,
[12335.39s -> 12336.51s]  like people do 24 hour...
[12336.51s -> 12339.39s]  People do like 12 to 24 hour streams all the time.
[12339.39s -> 12341.05s]  Not me.
[12341.05s -> 12344.33s]  Not me.
[12344.33s -> 12344.65s]  I don't...
[12344.65s -> 12347.39s]  I never do that.
[12347.39s -> 12349.31s]  Are you going to do turmoil the entire time?
[12349.31s -> 12354.70s]  I'm going to assume I'm probably going to beat this in the next few hours.
[12354.70s -> 12357.79s]  Maybe the next two hours or so.
[12357.79s -> 12361.04s]  And then we'll move on to something else.
[12361.04s -> 12362.08s]  You're going to die.
[12362.72s -> 12364.24s]  I'm not going to die.
[12364.24s -> 12374.16s]  Is French bread pizza a bad choice if you want to stream still?
[12374.16s -> 12377.47s]  Oh yeah, there's vegetables on it.
[12377.47s -> 12379.34s]  No, I'll be fine.
[12379.34s -> 12380.54s]  Get the food coma.
[12384.75s -> 12388.22s]  Eat a big French bread pizza and then fall asleep.
[12388.22s -> 12388.94s]  No, I'm up.
[12388.94s -> 12389.82s]  I'm not going to bed.
[12389.82s -> 12394.25s]  Don't worry.
[12394.25s -> 12395.53s]  Yeah, I don't really do this.
[12395.53s -> 12397.16s]  I never do it.
[12397.16s -> 12399.08s]  I'm a four to five hour Andy.
[12399.08s -> 12404.03s]  I guess I don't really have to explain why, but I am.
[12404.03s -> 12404.59s]  All right.
[12404.59s -> 12407.23s]  Is this worth it or no?
[12407.23s -> 12409.23s]  Because all the 50s are probably gone by now.
[12409.23s -> 12412.81s]  That's pretty good.
[12412.81s -> 12417.29s]  I think I'm going to do this.
[12418.09s -> 12420.65s]  It's never going to go below 83 left ink.
[12420.65s -> 12431.88s]  25 horses.
[12431.88s -> 12434.68s]  Dowser stops waving when you tap into what he found.
[12434.68s -> 12436.04s]  If he's still waving, you haven't found it.
[12436.04s -> 12437.24s]  That's actually a really good tip.
[12437.24s -> 12443.90s]  That's a good tip.
[12443.90s -> 12457.74s]  I have 24 grand.
[12457.74s -> 12471.90s]  It's mine.
[12474.36s -> 12475.48s]  One percent share.
[12475.48s -> 12476.92s]  Oh, but it's okay.
[12476.92s -> 12480.60s]  I have to start to make money.
[12480.60s -> 12480.92s]  Okay.
[12480.92s -> 12481.72s]  Land auction.
[12481.72s -> 12483.98s]  Let's move.
[12483.98s -> 12485.87s]  I'm going to stay right there.
[12485.87s -> 12487.36s]  Right in the middle.
[12487.36s -> 12493.07s]  And also I'm drinking a lot of water.
[12493.07s -> 12495.96s]  I'm doing a I'm drinking a bunch of super hydrators.
[12495.96s -> 12498.38s]  I've got my hydration.
[12498.38s -> 12503.82s]  There's a ghost in the room.
[12503.82s -> 12505.26s]  Use the diamond for the good land.
[12505.26s -> 12507.10s]  I don't think there's any good land left.
[12507.10s -> 12510.14s]  It was all up here.
[12510.70s -> 12514.78s]  It seems to be spreading thinner down here.
[12516.41s -> 12523.55s]  So I think I'm all right.
[12523.55s -> 12524.27s]  Yeah, let's just go.
[12524.27s -> 12524.83s]  I'm good.
[12524.83s -> 12526.92s]  I hope I got a good one.
[12532.08s -> 12534.96s]  Tell me to stop doing moles after I spend a thousand bucks.
[12534.96s -> 12538.78s]  Okay.
[12538.78s -> 12539.34s]  Thousand bucks?
[12542.48s -> 12543.28s]  What do you think?
[12543.28s -> 12546.48s]  Should I spend like one thousand on moles?
[12546.48s -> 12548.44s]  I don't want to go too far.
[12548.44s -> 12556.41s]  Jeremy, you should record the don't call the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[12556.41s -> 12561.13s]  This is your only chance.
[12561.13s -> 12561.61s]  All right.
[12561.61s -> 12562.17s]  What did I buy?
[12563.16s -> 12564.28s]  What's hey, hold on.
[12564.28s -> 12568.36s]  What side did I buy that was never going to go under 87 cents?
[12568.36s -> 12573.66s]  Was it right or left?
[12573.66s -> 12578.14s]  Because they both high left.
[12578.14s -> 12578.94s]  Okay.
[12578.94s -> 12581.88s]  So this worked out perfectly.
[12598.16s -> 12599.84s]  You might be thinking, what are you doing, man?
[12599.84s -> 12601.31s]  Well, oh, okay.
[12601.31s -> 12602.43s]  We got one over there.
[12602.43s -> 12605.26s]  I want to be able to start making money now.
[12605.26s -> 12612.76s]  Okay, let's go.
[12612.76s -> 12613.32s]  Start moving.
[12613.88s -> 12630.00s]  Okay.
[12630.00s -> 12633.26s]  No, I'm not doing a silo yet.
[12633.26s -> 12650.67s]  I love the moles.
[12650.67s -> 12651.55s]  They're so fun.
[12651.55s -> 12663.93s]  Silo is going right here.
[12663.93s -> 12664.65s]  Very close.
[12665.21s -> 12671.40s]  Everybody is going to be delivering to the left.
[12671.40s -> 12675.05s]  Okay.
[12675.05s -> 12675.93s]  Is that enough horses?
[12677.42s -> 12678.70s]  Oh, look at this.
[12679.26s -> 12680.22s]  This is a huge one.
[12680.22s -> 12681.26s]  I got to go to here.
[12681.26s -> 12684.51s]  This is a big one.
[12684.51s -> 12698.12s]  It's empty.
[12698.12s -> 12698.60s]  This one.
[12698.60s -> 12698.92s]  Okay.
[12698.92s -> 12702.80s]  I got to go here and then I'll go a little bit down this way.
[12702.80s -> 12708.54s]  Any more moles?
[12708.54s -> 12726.01s]  No, I don't want to do more than a thousand dollars in moles.
[12726.01s -> 12727.61s]  It's very possible that this is it.
[12727.61s -> 12733.15s]  There's probably only a couple more here.
[12733.15s -> 12742.38s]  The silo turned out to be kind of not really helping.
[12742.38s -> 12757.08s]  Bring a dowser out.
[12757.08s -> 12757.56s]  Easy.
[12757.56s -> 12759.08s]  Easy with this bullshit.
[12759.08s -> 12759.88s]  Easy.
[12759.88s -> 12769.05s]  Some of you deliver and some of you store.
[12769.05s -> 12770.09s]  Did you find something?
[12770.09s -> 12781.16s]  More of you need to come over here.
[12781.16s -> 12786.41s]  Got something?
[12786.41s -> 12802.51s]  I need to start selling.
[12802.51s -> 12803.39s]  What do you got?
[12803.63s -> 12805.56s]  What do you got?
[12805.56s -> 12806.44s]  There's nothing here.
[12806.44s -> 12814.80s]  Sell right?
[12816.62s -> 12821.74s]  It's too late.
[12821.74s -> 12837.55s]  Nothing over there?
[12837.55s -> 12838.11s]  Nothing?
[12838.11s -> 12839.53s]  What about all the way down?
[12839.53s -> 12841.60s]  There's got to be something, right?
[12841.60s -> 12844.68s]  It's too late.
[12844.68s -> 12845.32s]  I can't go.
[12845.32s -> 12845.80s]  It's too late.
[12845.80s -> 12858.81s]  I can't go right.
[12858.81s -> 12859.61s]  It is too late.
[12859.61s -> 12861.10s]  Is there anything left?
[12861.10s -> 12865.45s]  Why do I keep getting such shitty ones?
[12865.45s -> 12873.45s]  Dowser didn't find anything.
[12873.45s -> 12875.56s]  I think I'm pulling out.
[12875.56s -> 12877.32s]  Should I pull out?
[12877.32s -> 12880.14s]  Would you pull out if you were me?
[12880.14s -> 12886.83s]  Would you pull out?
[12886.83s -> 12896.11s]  I got to do three more moles.
[12896.11s -> 12898.20s]  And then I'm pulling out.
[12898.20s -> 12915.85s]  I'm out.
[12915.85s -> 12917.05s]  Oh, fuck off.
[12917.05s -> 12917.79s]  Really?
[12917.79s -> 12918.59s]  It's fine.
[12918.59s -> 12924.25s]  I don't care about the shares this time.
[12924.25s -> 12930.06s]  I need to start upgrading.
[12930.06s -> 12930.94s]  Pizza's ready.
[12930.94s -> 12933.28s]  All right.
[12933.28s -> 12934.72s]  Let me go grab my French bread pizza.
[12934.72s -> 12936.41s]  I'm going to eat it on stream.
[12936.41s -> 12938.73s]  I'm going to be off cam maybe for a little bit.
[12938.73s -> 12940.91s]  I'll be literally back in two seconds.
[12940.91s -> 13023.98s]  Give me one second.
[13023.98s -> 13026.46s]  I honestly don't really don't want to spill this
[13026.46s -> 13027.50s]  or get this on anything.
[13027.50s -> 13029.32s]  I'm sure I have enough room.
[13030.04s -> 13031.90s]  What do you got?
[13031.90s -> 13032.46s]  You guys want to see it?
[13033.02s -> 13035.34s]  It's pretty basic.
[13035.34s -> 13036.06s]  It's pretty generic.
[13036.70s -> 13037.58s]  It's just the...
[13037.58s -> 13038.06s]  What is it?
[13038.78s -> 13042.41s]  Who makes this sauce?
[13042.41s -> 13042.65s]  Okay.
[13042.65s -> 13043.29s]  Hold on.
[13043.29s -> 13045.92s]  One second here.
[13045.92s -> 13049.90s]  I'm ready.
[13049.90s -> 13052.41s]  You want to see?
[13052.41s -> 13053.69s]  Oh, Pog.
[13053.69s -> 13056.86s]  Actually looks pretty good.
[13056.86s -> 13061.08s]  It's like a commercial.
[13064.73s -> 13065.21s]  First bite.
[13065.21s -> 13066.73s]  Let me give you a review.
[13066.73s -> 13067.29s]  This is what...
[13068.01s -> 13069.76s]  Who makes this?
[13069.76s -> 13070.64s]  Who makes this?
[13070.64s -> 13073.24s]  Holly, who makes this?
[13073.24s -> 13073.80s]  Who makes this?
[13079.48s -> 13080.68s]  We need it closer.
[13080.68s -> 13086.60s]  Red Baron.
[13086.60s -> 13086.76s]  All right.
[13086.76s -> 13088.04s]  This is Red Baron.
[13088.04s -> 13097.53s]  Peppers, pepperoni, sausage, cheese, tomato sauce, and bread pizza.
[13097.53s -> 13098.57s]  Real review.
[13098.57s -> 13101.53s]  It's been a long time since I've had a Red Baron French bread pizza.
[13101.53s -> 13102.33s]  Let's give it a review.
[13103.96s -> 13104.68s]  Here we go.
[13104.68s -> 13105.90s]  Kind of nervous.
[13105.90s -> 13112.81s]  It's too hot to bite.
[13112.81s -> 13113.61s]  Give me a second.
[13113.61s -> 13120.83s]  That's how you tell if it's too hot.
[13120.83s -> 13131.77s]  If I had just bit that, it would have been a bad experience.
[13131.77s -> 13133.53s]  Okay, here we go.
[13133.53s -> 13156.09s]  And I'm going to give you an honest review.
[13156.09s -> 13156.73s]  Very good.
[13156.73s -> 13157.50s]  I would get...
[13157.50s -> 13162.46s]  Okay, honestly, there's a lot of peppers flavor.
[13162.46s -> 13165.95s]  Big crunch.
[13165.95s -> 13169.23s]  Actually, I'm getting the peppers, sausage, and peppers.
[13169.23s -> 13171.24s]  Let's try over here.
[13171.24s -> 13192.67s]  Oh, I swallowed that way too early.
[13192.67s -> 13193.79s]  Oh, fuck.
[13193.79s -> 13200.08s]  Oh, I hate that.
[13200.08s -> 13202.96s]  You know when you eat something, especially something crunchy,
[13202.96s -> 13213.31s]  and you swallow it too early, and you just feel it just attack your entire insides?
[13213.31s -> 13215.39s]  Is that a soundboard or is that real?
[13217.63s -> 13218.91s]  Is it a soundboard?
[13218.91s -> 13220.97s]  Do you think that crunch is a soundboard?
[13223.76s -> 13235.96s]  Do you think so?
[13235.96s -> 13242.65s]  It's fucking delicious.
[13242.65s -> 13243.77s]  It's not a soundboard.
[13243.77s -> 13278.01s]  Let me try that again.
[13278.01s -> 13279.21s]  God damn, it's good.
[13279.21s -> 13286.03s]  I wonder.
[13289.15s -> 13289.65s]  Yo!
[13298.22s -> 13299.50s]  Minecraft dirt?
[13299.50s -> 13307.74s]  Minecraft eating sound effect?
[13307.74s -> 13317.16s]  Let me...
[13317.16s -> 13321.69s]  Mine's better.
[13321.69s -> 13322.49s]  Mine's better.
[13322.49s -> 13344.14s]  That's way better.
[13344.14s -> 13344.86s]  They should use that.
[13376.56s -> 13382.43s]  Was it a soundboard?
[13382.43s -> 13389.64s]  I can record myself talking and play it.
[13389.64s -> 13390.68s]  I can play it back.
[13390.68s -> 13391.64s]  I can play it back.
[13391.64s -> 13393.45s]  That was a real crunch.
[13393.45s -> 13395.69s]  I recorded that.
[13395.69s -> 13401.60s]  Damn, that sounds good.
[13401.60s -> 13402.08s]  Really?
[13402.08s -> 13405.44s]  That sounds great.
[13405.44s -> 13408.94s]  Did they make commercials for Red Baron Pizza where it sounds like this?
[13408.94s -> 13411.18s]  Because that actually happened.
[13411.18s -> 13412.78s]  That really happened.
[13412.78s -> 13414.59s]  So like, this is not horse shit.
[13414.59s -> 13438.68s]  That one wasn't good?
[13438.68s -> 13439.56s]  Well, that was a lot of sauce.
[13446.97s -> 13448.89s]  You're not going to get crazy crunches from the sauce.
[13448.89s -> 13455.87s]  It's not going to happen.
[13455.87s -> 13456.51s]  Hold on.
[13456.51s -> 13460.00s]  I'm going to try to get a fucking crazy one.
[13460.00s -> 13460.40s]  Hold on.
[13460.40s -> 13461.28s]  This is going to be crazy.
[13461.28s -> 13470.14s]  This is going to be the most ridiculous crunch you've ever heard in your whole life.
[13470.14s -> 13470.78s]  You ready?
[13470.78s -> 13491.28s]  Somebody has to do that.
[13491.28s -> 13504.75s]  I'm realizing.
[13504.75s -> 13510.72s]  This would be such a fun job.
[13510.72s -> 13515.76s]  Oh my God, I'm still wearing this.
[13515.76s -> 13517.44s]  What a cool, like, foley artist.
[13517.44s -> 13518.88s]  That sounds like such a great time.
[13518.88s -> 13523.60s]  You just get to hit bags of ice with hammers
[13523.60s -> 13528.40s]  and step on glass with boots and bite pizzas and shit.
[13529.04s -> 13529.84s]  And record it.
[13529.84s -> 13555.52s]  I think I could do it pretty well.
[13555.52s -> 13556.48s]  Do a foley stream.
[13556.48s -> 13568.41s]  That's actually a really fun idea.
[13568.41s -> 13570.97s]  Just get a blank slate of some type of video
[13570.97s -> 13580.52s]  or some public domain movie or something and do foley work to it.
[13580.52s -> 13581.32s]  This is good.
[13581.32s -> 13582.20s]  It's really good.
[13582.20s -> 13585.21s]  I haven't had one of these in a long time.
[13585.21s -> 13586.57s]  This is, I would say, pretty high up there.
[13586.57s -> 13594.49s]  I should have watched a video or something.
[13594.49s -> 13595.13s]  What am I doing?
[13595.13s -> 13615.36s]  Like a bunch of free sounds.
[13615.36s -> 13616.80s]  That is kind of a cool idea.
[13616.80s -> 13620.76s]  Just do a four or five-hour stream
[13620.76s -> 13623.16s]  where you just do a ton of fucking sound effects
[13623.16s -> 13624.60s]  and make them sound good
[13624.60s -> 13626.59s]  and just release them all.
[13626.59s -> 13628.83s]  Just creative, what, creative commons zero
[13628.83s -> 13630.59s]  and just anybody can use them for anything.
[13630.59s -> 13631.93s]  I like that.
[13631.93s -> 13632.41s]  I kind of like that.
[13632.41s -> 13634.24s]  That's a fun idea.
[13634.24s -> 13635.84s]  Just royalty-free Andy, yeah.
[13635.84s -> 13641.55s]  Just have like 5,000 things that you'll never get claimed for.
[13641.55s -> 13642.11s]  I don't know.
[13642.11s -> 13653.16s]  Open source Andy.
[13653.16s -> 13675.32s]  Do foley for Nosferatu this Halloween.
[13675.32s -> 13705.44s]  License it for free for three years
[13705.44s -> 13707.36s]  and when those sounds go viral for being free,
[13707.36s -> 13708.48s]  people start paying for them.
[13708.48s -> 13711.40s]  We'll just be free.
[13711.40s -> 13728.00s]  I mean, look, if you're going to buy
[13728.00s -> 13731.04s]  a signed baseball for 50 bucks from me,
[13731.04s -> 13731.60s]  a lot of you guys,
[13733.58s -> 13735.34s]  that's not going to be fucking, you know, you just,
[13735.34s -> 13736.94s]  yeah, I gotta give you something, right?
[13736.94s -> 13737.66s]  I gotta give you back.
[13756.84s -> 13758.04s]  You guys have been getting them, right?
[13758.04s -> 13763.47s]  I tried, my signature, I tried to, okay.
[13763.47s -> 13766.92s]  So way back in the day, I used to,
[13766.92s -> 13768.36s]  and if I was at a convention,
[13769.00s -> 13770.76s]  it was actually pretty rare for someone to come up to me
[13770.76s -> 13773.40s]  and be like, hey man, can I get a signature?
[13774.04s -> 13777.47s]  Be like, yeah, why?
[13777.47s -> 13778.59s]  You want my signature?
[13779.31s -> 13782.27s]  I just really didn't know what to do.
[13782.91s -> 13787.40s]  So a long time ago, I used to just write
[13787.40s -> 13790.70s]  in just generic print, German,
[13790.70s -> 13793.93s]  and then I would put a bit,
[13793.93s -> 13796.33s]  like a little swoosh under the A,
[13796.33s -> 13797.77s]  and I did that for a long time.
[13800.22s -> 13801.42s]  After a while, I kind of realized,
[13801.42s -> 13802.94s]  I was like, that's just the Amazon logo.
[13802.94s -> 13804.38s]  I don't want to do that anymore.
[13804.38s -> 13808.97s]  It's just, it was the A with the thing.
[13808.97s -> 13810.24s]  No.
[13810.24s -> 13812.72s]  So then for Dollhouse, I was like,
[13812.72s -> 13816.00s]  what if I did like a big swooping J in the 985, right?
[13816.56s -> 13818.20s]  I was like, okay, I can do that.
[13818.20s -> 13820.04s]  I can consistently do like a J.
[13820.04s -> 13822.84s]  It was like a cursive big, like 985.
[13823.40s -> 13824.12s]  I was like, yeah, okay.
[13825.28s -> 13829.08s]  And then I started doing them for baseball,
[13829.64s -> 13833.07s]  and I realized it's really hard to draw on a baseball.
[13833.07s -> 13837.82s]  And I know some of you already sent like pictures of,
[13837.82s -> 13840.86s]  hey dude, like the J's wicked fucked up on this one.
[13841.42s -> 13844.73s]  And I'm just like, oh shit.
[13845.37s -> 13848.24s]  And like the J's like kind of goes like this,
[13848.24s -> 13849.28s]  and then out and around.
[13850.92s -> 13852.92s]  So then I tried to change it a little more.
[13852.92s -> 13855.96s]  I was like, okay, what if I add like a little tail to the J
[13855.96s -> 13857.00s]  and then the 985?
[13863.12s -> 13863.60s]  I don't know.
[13863.60s -> 13864.64s]  I'm bad with this kind of stuff.
[13864.64s -> 13866.16s]  I don't sign stuff.
[13866.16s -> 13867.04s]  I really don't.
[13867.04s -> 13870.51s]  That's the best part is your shitty handwriting.
[13871.07s -> 13876.67s]  I'm stuck.
[13876.67s -> 13883.45s]  It's authentic.
[13883.45s -> 13884.17s]  And then I was going to do,
[13884.17s -> 13886.01s]  one of them was going to be just like a crack ball.
[13886.65s -> 13890.41s]  I was going to draw just fucked up stuff all over it,
[13890.41s -> 13891.53s]  just like crazy shit,
[13891.53s -> 13893.85s]  just markings and like hieroglyphics or something.
[13895.21s -> 13898.09s]  And write like in all capitals, huge across the ball,
[13898.09s -> 13903.20s]  you got the crack ball.
[13903.20s -> 13905.12s]  But one of you would have gotten it and it's not,
[13905.12s -> 13906.96s]  it would have been like, okay, who's,
[13906.96s -> 13907.92s]  who got the crack ball?
[13907.92s -> 13908.96s]  Because there's only one.
[13909.52s -> 13923.34s]  Dude, I could have gotten a better signature
[13923.34s -> 13924.54s]  at a little league game.
[13924.54s -> 13956.80s]  I don't think you could.
[13956.80s -> 13958.00s]  We got robbed at the crack.
[13958.00s -> 13959.20s]  No, I hope people are happy with them.
[13959.20s -> 13960.08s]  I really do.
[13960.08s -> 13961.76s]  Every time I sell anything, I just go like,
[13961.76s -> 13962.96s]  oh, this is suck.
[13962.96s -> 13963.76s]  People think it's okay.
[13964.40s -> 13965.28s]  I hope everything is all right.
[13967.84s -> 13968.48s]  I like doing it.
[13968.48s -> 13968.96s]  It was fun.
[13969.60s -> 13971.29s]  Hope you guys, whoever got one,
[13984.91s -> 13985.95s]  you're a scammer.
[13988.43s -> 13989.71s]  You know, I will sell you.
[13989.71s -> 13991.28s]  I'll tell you right now.
[13991.28s -> 13994.16s]  If there was, if anybody ever really,
[13994.96s -> 13996.32s]  like genuinely, like not fucking around,
[13997.13s -> 13998.73s]  if people were genuinely like,
[13999.60s -> 14002.48s]  dude, that he like, I feel like I fucking got scammed.
[14002.48s -> 14003.84s]  I got scammed.
[14003.84s -> 14005.34s]  And a bunch of people were like,
[14005.34s -> 14008.00s]  yeah, dude, we got fucking scammed.
[14008.00s -> 14010.48s]  I would be, I would be freaking out.
[14010.48s -> 14013.58s]  I'd be like, how do I fix this as fast as possible?
[14013.58s -> 14015.34s]  How do I make sure this is fixed immediately?
[14016.06s -> 14019.24s]  I would never want anyone to think that I genuinely
[14019.24s -> 14020.92s]  was just trying to take their money or something.
[14021.48s -> 14025.55s]  I would try to, you know, not scam people.
[14025.55s -> 14026.83s]  If people really thought that it was,
[14026.83s -> 14028.59s]  oh, wow, dude, this is like kind of fucked up.
[14029.23s -> 14032.75s]  I would, I would not sleep until that was fixed,
[14032.75s -> 14033.31s]  at least enough.
[14033.87s -> 14037.47s]  I hate that idea.
[14037.47s -> 14039.31s]  It just, it kind of keeps me up at night sometimes.
[14040.19s -> 14042.19s]  It's like, okay, wait, people are buying a bunch of shit.
[14042.83s -> 14045.18s]  Okay.
[14045.18s -> 14048.20s]  What do they don't like it?
[14048.76s -> 14049.79s]  You know what I mean?
[14049.79s -> 14052.43s]  I just, it kind of keeps me up sometimes.
[14053.07s -> 14058.06s]  Are you going to do the signed playing card?
[14058.06s -> 14058.78s]  Hold on a minute.
[14059.34s -> 14061.90s]  Are you going to do signed playing cards
[14061.90s -> 14063.90s]  for the Mr. Green stream?
[14066.43s -> 14067.07s]  Where'd you get that?
[14067.07s -> 14068.27s]  Who told you that?
[14068.27s -> 14069.48s]  Who told you that was,
[14069.48s -> 14071.72s]  that was going to be a Mr. Green stream?
[14071.72s -> 14073.88s]  I don't remember anybody ever saying that.
[14076.56s -> 14077.04s]  I did.
[14077.04s -> 14078.32s]  I don't remember ever saying,
[14078.88s -> 14080.46s]  I don't know who told you that,
[14081.90s -> 14083.50s]  that I was going to get into
[14085.20s -> 14087.76s]  five to $10,000 of prosthetics
[14090.24s -> 14092.88s]  to be Mr. Green's doing something.
[14093.52s -> 14095.28s]  I mean, why would you get that idea?
[14095.28s -> 14101.50s]  Who would, who would tell you that?
[14102.14s -> 14102.94s]  I don't think it was me.
[14103.50s -> 14104.78s]  Whoever it was, they're in trouble.
[14105.66s -> 14114.56s]  Whoever leaked that.
[14114.64s -> 14120.22s]  I'm not, I'm not happy about it.
[14120.22s -> 14120.78s]  Wink, wink.
[14125.10s -> 14125.98s]  That's the next stream.
[14126.78s -> 14127.58s]  That's the next stream.
[14127.58s -> 14127.90s]  Okay.
[14127.90s -> 14128.78s]  Hey, this is late night.
[14128.78s -> 14129.18s]  No one's here.
[14129.18s -> 14131.58s]  No one's here.
[14131.58s -> 14133.34s]  No one's, this is literally,
[14133.34s -> 14134.94s]  it was our, almost our number 10.
[14135.66s -> 14136.78s]  It's like 11 o'clock Pacific.
[14136.78s -> 14139.36s]  No one's even here right now.
[14139.36s -> 14140.80s]  There's 12,000 people here.
[14141.60s -> 14142.88s]  Yeah, but there is,
[14142.88s -> 14144.32s]  well, there is a lot of people here.
[14144.32s -> 14146.51s]  That's a lot of people still here.
[14150.17s -> 14152.73s]  I'm not going to announce anything about it yet.
[14154.33s -> 14156.17s]  Mr. Green's is going to do a stream
[14156.17s -> 14157.37s]  and it should be a lot of fun.
[14162.80s -> 14163.92s]  Wait, you said,
[14164.48s -> 14165.12s]  you said so.
[14165.12s -> 14166.88s]  You said you're going to dress up in a big,
[14166.88s -> 14169.12s]  a big fat suit and paint your body green.
[14169.12s -> 14172.46s]  And wait, hold on.
[14172.46s -> 14174.62s]  You said this after you smoked three joints.
[14175.18s -> 14177.84s]  When did I smoke joints on stream?
[14178.40s -> 14181.31s]  I did.
[14181.87s -> 14184.62s]  Is it going to be this year?
[14184.62s -> 14193.90s]  Trying to make it this year.
[14196.49s -> 14199.37s]  The hope is that somewhere into December,
[14200.09s -> 14201.29s]  this would be happening.
[14201.29s -> 14205.40s]  It's going to shove a decade.
[14206.36s -> 14211.34s]  You said this during the bug snack stream.
[14211.34s -> 14212.78s]  Yeah, but I know it was never real.
[14212.78s -> 14213.90s]  It's real now.
[14213.90s -> 14221.10s]  All right, let's go.
[14221.10s -> 14221.82s]  Let's play. Let's play.
[14221.82s -> 14224.78s]  But yeah, I, I'm not going to give any details on it
[14224.78s -> 14226.62s]  until I really want to.
[14226.62s -> 14234.00s]  But the next big thing to do is Mr. Green's stream.
[14234.00s -> 14235.76s]  And just like baseball, you'll know about it.
[14236.64s -> 14239.12s]  You won't really know about it until it happens, really.
[14239.68s -> 14243.36s]  So it should be fun.
[14243.36s -> 14245.20s]  A lot of, a lot of ideas,
[14245.20s -> 14246.64s]  a lot of things that I want to do.
[14246.64s -> 14248.68s]  Let's see if it works.
[14249.64s -> 14258.27s]  Okay, I have 30 grand.
[14258.91s -> 14260.19s]  What do I want to do with it?
[14260.19s -> 14264.03s]  What are your thoughts on sherbert ice cream?
[14264.03s -> 14264.75s]  I love sherbert ice cream.
[14264.75s -> 14265.31s]  It's fantastic.
[14267.92s -> 14269.52s]  I wish I was in the mood for it more.
[14270.16s -> 14282.52s]  I will tell you this.
[14283.32s -> 14284.68s]  No, no more leaking.
[14284.68s -> 14285.72s]  I just said, all right, that's it.
[14285.72s -> 14286.76s]  You're not going to hear anything else.
[14286.76s -> 14287.88s]  And now I'm just like, well,
[14287.88s -> 14294.08s]  you know what else I want to tell you?
[14294.08s -> 14294.96s]  32,000.
[14298.78s -> 14299.42s]  This is a 5%.
[14300.46s -> 14306.49s]  I want it.
[14306.49s -> 14307.71s]  20 grand.
[14307.71s -> 14308.35s]  Give it to me.
[14308.35s -> 14309.39s]  I'm at 8%.
[14309.39s -> 14323.71s]  I still got 10 grand.
[14323.71s -> 14326.44s]  All right, let's do it.
[14326.44s -> 14327.24s]  Land auction.
[14327.24s -> 14328.36s]  Okay, so look, I'm going to,
[14328.36s -> 14331.39s]  I'm going to say right in the middle.
[14331.39s -> 14333.87s]  That's the idea.
[14333.87s -> 14342.46s]  He wants to talk about it so bad.
[14342.46s -> 14344.86s]  Nothing will ever match the pain
[14345.74s -> 14348.22s]  of having to keep the dollhouse completely under wraps
[14348.78s -> 14350.30s]  for almost a full year.
[14350.30s -> 14351.74s]  It was so painful.
[14351.74s -> 14354.30s]  I want to just scream it every day.
[14355.42s -> 14358.46s]  But I think it made that show way more fun.
[14370.28s -> 14375.16s]  No more, no more leaking and no more moles.
[14375.16s -> 14384.52s]  Okay, not a bad start.
[14384.52s -> 14386.97s]  This is right here.
[14386.97s -> 14387.47s]  Perfect.
[14391.55s -> 14392.75s]  I need to make some cash.
[14392.75s -> 14393.87s]  Let's go right side.
[14393.87s -> 14399.40s]  I'm not going to upgrade this pipe yet.
[14399.40s -> 14402.46s]  It's probably a bad idea.
[14402.94s -> 14403.66s]  All right, right here.
[14408.96s -> 14412.96s]  All right, let's get some, go left.
[14414.91s -> 14418.24s]  Yeah, yeah.
[14418.24s -> 14423.31s]  I just don't want this to overflow.
[14424.03s -> 14427.23s]  Which it really shouldn't because it's only level, what?
[14427.23s -> 14429.47s]  Level two or level one.
[14429.47s -> 14432.58s]  Go right.
[14433.20s -> 14438.09s]  Once I get about two grand is when I can really start to do some stuff.
[14440.08s -> 14441.36s]  Well, I'm not going to do anything yet.
[14442.08s -> 14446.30s]  Over a dollar, man.
[14446.30s -> 14456.99s]  Okay, so now stay on the right.
[14456.99s -> 14458.35s]  There's no reason to stop.
[14458.35s -> 14461.68s]  Upgrade the vans.
[14462.32s -> 14467.26s]  Okay, let's get it now.
[14467.98s -> 14475.18s]  Bulls remind me to upgrade the moles after this.
[14475.18s -> 14481.82s]  All right, hold it, hold it.
[14481.82s -> 14496.03s]  All right, straight down, which I think I'm just going to do another one.
[14496.03s -> 14502.04s]  All right, let's upgrade these.
[14502.68s -> 14523.33s]  Okay.
[14524.19s -> 14527.55s]  Should I sell holes, moles, moles?
[14527.55s -> 14529.12s]  Oh, shit.
[14529.12s -> 14530.67s]  This is a huge one, too.
[14530.67s -> 14531.95s]  I'll connect this one down there.
[14531.95s -> 14534.48s]  67.
[14534.48s -> 14534.88s]  That's not up.
[14534.88s -> 14536.89s]  That's not terrible.
[14536.89s -> 14538.01s]  It's not great either.
[14543.63s -> 14544.35s]  Need money, though.
[14546.00s -> 14546.50s]  Come on.
[14547.06s -> 14550.54s]  71, 69.
[14550.54s -> 14551.90s]  Come on, 70, 70 cents.
[14552.54s -> 14563.07s]  70 cents.
[14563.07s -> 14563.63s]  God damn it.
[14564.88s -> 14565.84s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[14566.85s -> 14567.89s]  Right, not right side yet.
[14568.45s -> 14575.73s]  Yeah, this is a big one.
[14575.73s -> 14576.69s]  Let's double drain it.
[14577.33s -> 14595.58s]  Okay, double drain incoming moles out here.
[14595.58s -> 14605.20s]  That has 90.
[14605.20s -> 14606.40s]  I'm doing right side.
[14606.40s -> 14615.12s]  Close enough.
[14615.12s -> 14636.16s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14636.16s -> 14636.80s]  Let's do them all.
[14636.80s -> 14637.84s]  Just get them all out here.
[14637.84s -> 14644.86s]  Okay, well, this can go this way and this can go this way.
[14644.86s -> 14648.53s]  All right, sell.
[14652.85s -> 14661.78s]  Yeah, is there anything else down here?
[14661.78s -> 14665.42s]  What are you going to be for Halloween?
[14667.36s -> 14669.04s]  A ninja.
[14669.04s -> 14680.74s]  Is it even worth doing this?
[14680.74s -> 14687.94s]  Yeah, find some.
[14687.94s -> 14694.11s]  The good part about splitting this is
[14694.11s -> 14696.75s]  you don't have to upgrade the drill twice, which is good.
[14696.75s -> 14702.64s]  Although I know how much it really is left.
[14702.64s -> 14710.59s]  Should I upgrade the dowsers?
[14710.59s -> 14712.27s]  I feel like I haven't really been doing it at all.
[14712.83s -> 14715.76s]  This might be it.
[14715.76s -> 14718.86s]  November.
[14718.86s -> 14719.95s]  This is probably it.
[14720.51s -> 14727.89s]  70.
[14727.89s -> 14729.01s]  Yes, yeah, I got it.
[14729.01s -> 14729.65s]  Let's get out of here.
[14730.37s -> 14740.29s]  Sell it.
[14740.29s -> 14741.49s]  All right, is there anything else?
[14742.35s -> 14743.47s]  I don't think so.
[14743.47s -> 14746.22s]  I mean, I guess I could check here.
[14747.02s -> 14748.00s]  I think it's empty.
[14750.40s -> 14751.76s]  Zero planning, Andy.
[14751.76s -> 14752.24s]  What do you mean?
[14753.60s -> 14754.24s]  I got it all.
[14754.88s -> 14757.31s]  Yeah, I want zero planning, Andy.
[14757.31s -> 14757.63s]  I'm good.
[14758.19s -> 14760.03s]  I'm going to get the bonus too.
[14760.03s -> 14762.59s]  15 grand.
[14762.59s -> 14764.74s]  Oops, sorry.
[14767.54s -> 14771.30s]  Also too, you guys have had about 10 hours to hear this.
[14773.46s -> 14775.14s]  Is the audio actually better?
[14775.14s -> 14776.58s]  Is this mic, is this better?
[14778.13s -> 14779.01s]  Are we happy with this?
[14779.73s -> 14780.77s]  Is everybody think this is good?
[14782.54s -> 14782.78s]  Yeah.
[14783.42s -> 14785.33s]  Okay, cool.
[14786.05s -> 14787.33s]  Perfect.
[14787.33s -> 14788.21s]  It's so much better.
[14788.85s -> 14790.88s]  All right, that makes me happy.
[14794.74s -> 14795.94s]  Stock auction again.
[14795.94s -> 14797.30s]  I don't think I want to participate.
[14799.87s -> 14800.59s]  I want more money.
[14801.15s -> 14802.35s]  I already have 8% of the shares.
[14802.35s -> 14803.31s]  That'd be fine.
[14803.31s -> 14812.30s]  I mean, they're all going to be bad, but I'll try this one.
[14812.86s -> 14814.64s]  Never mind.
[14814.64s -> 14817.18s]  I guess I'll take the terrible one.
[14817.82s -> 14821.07s]  This is the end of the desert.
[14828.43s -> 14829.07s]  48%?
[14829.07s -> 14830.19s]  No, no, no, 4%.
[14836.18s -> 14837.30s]  This guy's going to buy it.
[14837.30s -> 14837.70s]  That's me.
[14838.42s -> 14840.08s]  Hold on.
[14840.08s -> 14841.84s]  I can just wait till it gets all the way down.
[14841.84s -> 14842.56s]  They don't have any money.
[14848.74s -> 14850.50s]  Okay, thanks for the 4%.
[14850.50s -> 14851.78s]  I got 12% now.
[14851.78s -> 14853.33s]  That's perfect.
[14853.33s -> 14854.69s]  That was me up there.
[14854.69s -> 14857.47s]  I got money.
[14857.47s -> 14877.55s]  I'm in a good spot.
[14877.55s -> 14882.02s]  Again, over here.
[14882.02s -> 14884.77s]  Pretty big one on the left.
[14887.42s -> 14888.06s]  All right.
[14888.06s -> 14905.71s]  I can just barely make it.
[14906.58s -> 14907.30s]  Need coffee?
[14908.50s -> 14909.94s]  Don't drink too much coffee too late, though.
[14910.58s -> 14911.30s]  It's actually really...
[14912.02s -> 14913.38s]  I didn't have too much caffeine too late.
[14918.30s -> 14918.86s]  Really?
[14918.86s -> 14920.30s]  Right when the price goes down.
[14920.30s -> 14943.30s]  I'm just going to farm this for a second.
[14943.30s -> 14944.42s]  Whoa!
[14944.42s -> 14945.30s]  Left side.
[14945.30s -> 14959.92s]  Get to about two grand.
[14959.92s -> 14960.42s]  All right.
[14961.78s -> 14962.58s]  There was one over here.
[14963.14s -> 14964.02s]  This is a little one, though.
[14975.82s -> 14977.26s]  I'm obsessed with the moles.
[14977.26s -> 15003.54s]  One there.
[15003.54s -> 15004.04s]  All right.
[15005.30s -> 15016.00s]  Right side.
[15016.00s -> 15016.88s]  Left side.
[15037.26s -> 15038.48s]  Now.
[15038.48s -> 15040.00s]  You need to go this way.
[15044.69s -> 15045.17s]  Straight down.
[15045.73s -> 15049.12s]  Can you put your channel on television
[15049.12s -> 15050.88s]  so I can watch with my parents out in the living room?
[15052.70s -> 15053.42s]  Go get the app.
[15053.42s -> 15055.62s]  There's a TV app.
[15055.62s -> 15056.74s]  You can put it on TV.
[15056.74s -> 15057.70s]  It's on Apple TV.
[15057.70s -> 15058.50s]  It's on Xbox.
[15058.50s -> 15059.46s]  It's on PlayStation.
[15059.46s -> 15060.58s]  You can put it on TV.
[15060.58s -> 15074.26s]  All right.
[15074.26s -> 15074.98s]  Good find.
[15074.98s -> 15088.42s]  Okay.
[15088.42s -> 15090.98s]  Stop delivering.
[15090.98s -> 15091.30s]  Okay.
[15091.30s -> 15092.02s]  Start storing.
[15093.18s -> 15094.14s]  September.
[15094.14s -> 15098.40s]  All right.
[15098.40s -> 15099.52s]  Get the storage up.
[15099.52s -> 15101.65s]  I don't know if there's anything else over here.
[15102.21s -> 15111.90s]  It's probably upgraded.
[15111.90s -> 15112.46s]  Yep.
[15112.46s -> 15118.59s]  Store it.
[15118.59s -> 15119.79s]  Store it to the very end.
[15119.79s -> 15125.58s]  Here we go.
[15125.58s -> 15126.06s]  Check this out.
[15126.06s -> 15126.70s]  This is going to be huge.
[15127.82s -> 15129.18s]  $1.30 or $40.
[15129.18s -> 15134.13s]  Come on.
[15134.13s -> 15136.13s]  And not yet.
[15136.13s -> 15140.86s]  Not yet.
[15140.86s -> 15141.34s]  Not yet.
[15142.72s -> 15144.00s]  Oh, it's on the left side.
[15144.00s -> 15144.32s]  Hold on.
[15144.32s -> 15144.88s]  No, no, no, no.
[15144.88s -> 15145.28s]  Not yet.
[15145.28s -> 15145.92s]  Not yet.
[15145.92s -> 15151.38s]  Not yet.
[15151.38s -> 15152.10s]  Nope.
[15152.10s -> 15161.71s]  There's no more.
[15161.71s -> 15162.99s]  There's definitely no more.
[15162.99s -> 15163.63s]  That's a good haul.
[15168.02s -> 15169.54s]  Even if I missed it, it's too bad.
[15169.54s -> 15171.02s]  I just want to know.
[15171.02s -> 15171.82s]  Send a mole over there.
[15171.82s -> 15174.93s]  There's nothing else.
[15174.93s -> 15175.43s]  All right.
[15178.83s -> 15179.33s]  Yeah.
[15179.33s -> 15180.11s]  Give me that bonus.
[15182.14s -> 15187.41s]  $18,000.
[15187.41s -> 15189.01s]  You want to know where the gas is?
[15189.01s -> 15190.85s]  I'll drain my moles to sniff it out.
[15190.85s -> 15191.35s]  Gas.
[15192.24s -> 15195.12s]  Buy my new machinery to use gas to your advantage.
[15195.84s -> 15197.22s]  We move it again this time.
[15197.22s -> 15200.50s]  We're going to the plains which has the profitable but tricky natural gas.
[15204.44s -> 15205.32s]  Nope.
[15205.32s -> 15205.80s]  Not yet.
[15206.60s -> 15207.40s]  We're using a diamond.
[15209.99s -> 15212.31s]  Gas is not worth much if you let it escape through a rig.
[15212.87s -> 15215.35s]  Be sure to close valves to direct it.
[15215.91s -> 15222.48s]  Before you can sell gas to a company, visit Fred and buy the left link or right link upgrade first.
[15225.89s -> 15226.69s]  Oh, Jesus.
[15226.69s -> 15227.33s]  Really?
[15227.33s -> 15233.06s]  Let me do this first.
[15235.09s -> 15236.28s]  All right.
[15236.28s -> 15238.68s]  Point me in the direction of a insane.
[15241.60s -> 15242.40s]  Oh, that's good.
[15243.99s -> 15244.39s]  Right.
[15244.39s -> 15244.71s]  Okay.
[15244.71s -> 15245.99s]  So right ink.
[15249.88s -> 15250.28s]  Okay.
[15250.28s -> 15251.16s]  Right ink.
[15251.16s -> 15253.86s]  Upgrade the moles.
[15253.86s -> 15259.16s]  What about this though?
[15259.16s -> 15261.72s]  Moles will look for gas near every cell they uncover.
[15263.57s -> 15265.41s]  Do I need a different thing to upgrade it?
[15266.50s -> 15267.46s]  Or do I pull it out?
[15268.18s -> 15276.82s]  Why does he look away every time chat erupts?
[15277.38s -> 15280.58s]  It's the natural order of my head movement to the screen.
[15280.58s -> 15285.64s]  You need the connector for 30k.
[15293.03s -> 15296.13s]  What else is available?
[15302.07s -> 15302.57s]  Oh.
[15303.11s -> 15303.97s]  Okay.
[15303.97s -> 15305.33s]  So it's from the bottom.
[15305.33s -> 15309.44s]  I don't have enough money.
[15309.44s -> 15310.64s]  I could take a loan out.
[15310.64s -> 15313.35s]  I'm taking a loan out.
[15313.35s -> 15325.19s]  I'm taking out a loan.
[15325.19s -> 15339.91s]  Because remember, I got that guy to tell me where the best place was because I gave him a diamond.
[15343.83s -> 15346.47s]  And remember, I bought this too.
[15346.47s -> 15350.92s]  So if there's gas down there, I want to be able to get it.
[15350.92s -> 15357.64s]  We're doing right link because the right one is the one that is at 80 something cents.
[15357.64s -> 15359.33s]  All right.
[15359.33s -> 15360.37s]  So just don't lose.
[15361.01s -> 15363.20s]  I'm not doing the stock.
[15363.20s -> 15366.96s]  Unless it's, I mean, why 5%?
[15368.77s -> 15372.98s]  No, I'm not doing it.
[15372.98s -> 15373.54s]  All right.
[15373.54s -> 15375.22s]  So I got enough to go for it.
[15377.14s -> 15378.58s]  Wait, I have to do that.
[15378.58s -> 15379.14s]  Oh, shit.
[15379.14s -> 15379.94s]  I have to do this.
[15386.90s -> 15388.26s]  What if they're stupid and they didn't buy it?
[15389.06s -> 15389.86s]  I could probably just buy it.
[15390.50s -> 15396.21s]  I can't believe it's a 5% share of the company.
[15396.21s -> 15397.33s]  I can't believe no one's done this.
[15398.15s -> 15399.19s]  You're not going to let me do it, right?
[15399.83s -> 15400.71s]  Oh, of course not.
[15402.24s -> 15403.12s]  I can't believe that.
[15403.12s -> 15404.08s]  I would have bought it.
[15404.08s -> 15405.52s]  I just want to take another loan out.
[15412.80s -> 15413.12s]  All right.
[15413.12s -> 15415.52s]  So he said that this is the place to go.
[15416.40s -> 15417.28s]  Right here.
[15417.28s -> 15421.99s]  All right.
[15421.99s -> 15422.79s]  They don't even care.
[15422.79s -> 15423.91s]  I got the insider info.
[15424.55s -> 15425.99s]  So there's apparently a shitload of stuff here.
[15425.99s -> 15426.95s]  This is probably a huge one.
[15427.51s -> 15429.27s]  Okay.
[15429.27s -> 15429.67s]  Let's go.
[15433.11s -> 15433.35s]  All right.
[15433.35s -> 15433.75s]  Let's come on.
[15433.75s -> 15434.15s]  Let's do it.
[15436.60s -> 15439.16s]  Use a pipeline to transport gas to Wright Inc.
[15439.16s -> 15442.36s]  And oh, no, we'll make the oil price more right than ever.
[15443.64s -> 15443.96s]  All right.
[15443.96s -> 15444.52s]  Let's do it.
[15445.16s -> 15447.40s]  Besides just oil, these lands also have gas deposits.
[15447.40s -> 15452.20s]  If you drill to them, the gas will escape with high pressure and bring any oil with it as well.
[15452.20s -> 15453.24s]  So act cautiously.
[15453.24s -> 15453.64s]  Wait, what?
[15459.59s -> 15460.63s]  So that's a hazard.
[15474.63s -> 15475.91s]  That gas, what does it look like?
[15475.91s -> 15476.79s]  It's a good blue, right?
[15479.57s -> 15481.25s]  That's a major deposit right here.
[15488.21s -> 15490.29s]  Don't go too far so I can't get it.
[15491.01s -> 15491.73s]  Right?
[15491.73s -> 15500.08s]  Because I could get in trouble here and not be able to cross.
[15500.08s -> 15502.32s]  I'm like, yeah, you can't intersect.
[15503.04s -> 15503.36s]  Shit.
[15503.36s -> 15504.32s]  So I got to make sure there's enough.
[15504.32s -> 15505.20s]  There's a path to go this way.
[15506.00s -> 15507.56s]  This is a huge deposit too.
[15507.56s -> 15508.36s]  We're going to do two here.
[15518.68s -> 15519.80s]  Yeah, this is a big one.
[15519.80s -> 15524.55s]  In fact, let's go like this because then I'm going to go bang, bang.
[15535.52s -> 15535.84s]  Gas.
[15536.56s -> 15540.16s]  Holy shit.
[15540.16s -> 15540.80s]  That would have been bad.
[15541.44s -> 15565.75s]  Go deposit it.
[15565.75s -> 15576.32s]  Look at this.
[15576.96s -> 15577.60s]  This is perfect.
[15578.32s -> 15595.73s]  Companies cannot drill.
[15595.73s -> 15596.29s]  What?
[15596.29s -> 15598.74s]  Wait, what?
[15598.74s -> 15601.12s]  What do you mean?
[15601.12s -> 15603.83s]  What do you mean?
[15603.83s -> 15604.07s]  Left.
[15604.07s -> 15604.55s]  What do you mean?
[15604.55s -> 15606.16s]  Hold on.
[15606.16s -> 15607.84s]  I can't connect this to what?
[15607.84s -> 15609.49s]  What are you talking about?
[15609.49s -> 15610.69s]  Left is 126.
[15611.25s -> 15614.28s]  That's fine.
[15614.28s -> 15615.88s]  You have to connect your pipe to it.
[15619.27s -> 15619.67s]  I do?
[15620.31s -> 15629.94s]  Wait, what?
[15630.50s -> 15638.93s]  So now this has to go.
[15638.93s -> 15642.42s]  So this, what have I done?
[15643.14s -> 15644.20s]  Is it okay?
[15647.62s -> 15651.11s]  What if I go like this?
[15651.11s -> 15651.59s]  Can I connect?
[15651.59s -> 15652.39s]  I'm going to connect these two.
[15653.11s -> 15655.67s]  I might have just blown this, maybe.
[15656.93s -> 15663.56s]  And then, oh, wait, I can do that.
[15663.56s -> 15664.20s]  Is this going to work?
[15666.08s -> 15674.85s]  Engine gas is now escaping through a rig.
[15674.85s -> 15676.05s]  Close the rig to prevent this.
[15677.01s -> 15683.12s]  How much is this worth?
[15688.42s -> 15689.06s]  What's happening?
[15691.46s -> 15705.11s]  Oh, it's a, it's a buff, a buff.
[15705.11s -> 15707.19s]  It's like an overheal to your price.
[15708.71s -> 15709.67s]  Okay, I get it.
[15710.39s -> 15713.75s]  Oh, that's kind of sad.
[15718.34s -> 15719.94s]  That was so much money.
[15719.94s -> 15720.58s]  What a waste.
[15721.38s -> 15723.60s]  What's going on?
[15724.40s -> 15739.24s]  At least I understand it now.
[15739.24s -> 15745.86s]  Yeah, that's true.
[15745.86s -> 15766.72s]  Let's store some of this now.
[15766.72s -> 15773.81s]  This is a big one.
[15793.43s -> 15794.87s]  Big money on the left here.
[15794.87s -> 15804.52s]  Don't let that spill.
[15804.52s -> 15818.42s]  All right, pull back from the left.
[15818.42s -> 15819.30s]  Pull back from the left.
[15819.30s -> 15820.10s]  No reason to do that.
[15820.10s -> 15822.55s]  People can go with the right if they want.
[15822.55s -> 15826.80s]  20 grand so far.
[15826.80s -> 15827.68s]  This is pretty good.
[15827.68s -> 15835.32s]  Okay, nice.
[15835.32s -> 15836.12s]  Is this even in there?
[15839.41s -> 15840.37s]  Is this in?
[15840.37s -> 15841.73s]  I feel like it's not sucking anything.
[15841.73s -> 15842.21s]  It is, okay.
[15842.85s -> 15858.85s]  26 grand.
[15858.85s -> 15859.57s]  I'm doing good.
[15859.57s -> 15860.85s]  What are these upgrades?
[15860.85s -> 15862.45s]  This looks fucking terrible.
[15863.35s -> 15864.23s]  This is real.
[15864.95s -> 15865.67s]  I just looked over it
[15865.67s -> 15867.27s]  and I'm realizing just how bad this looks.
[15867.83s -> 15876.53s]  I forgot that people were watching me play
[15877.25s -> 15879.81s]  because this is really ugly.
[15880.53s -> 15888.23s]  This is supposed to be a mega deposit.
[15890.26s -> 15890.98s]  I'm just going to go this way.
[15890.98s -> 15891.30s]  Whatever.
[15892.02s -> 15897.65s]  Okay, gas.
[15898.29s -> 15909.70s]  Almost got it all.
[15911.14s -> 15912.04s]  It's okay.
[15912.04s -> 15913.40s]  25 grand is pretty good.
[15913.40s -> 15922.66s]  I don't think I want to buy another stock auction yet.
[15923.38s -> 15925.54s]  28 grand.
[15925.54s -> 15927.46s]  Okay, this is for 1%.
[15928.34s -> 15929.38s]  You guys can have it.
[15929.38s -> 15929.86s]  Who cares?
[15930.50s -> 15933.54s]  I'll buy it at one dollar.
[15934.26s -> 15944.02s]  If you were a fish, what kind of fish would you be?
[15944.02s -> 15948.92s]  Who you are, the dumbest person in the world.
[15949.48s -> 15950.23s]  Okay.
[15952.07s -> 15955.43s]  Enjoy your 2% or 10, like $9,000.
[15957.03s -> 15960.77s]  I'd probably be an electric eel.
[15961.41s -> 15968.45s]  Seems like the funnest answer.
[15968.45s -> 15979.41s]  Moles will look for gas.
[15979.41s -> 15980.45s]  I think that's good.
[15981.73s -> 15983.44s]  I'm going to get it.
[15984.48s -> 15991.11s]  I paid my loan back, right?
[15991.11s -> 15992.07s]  Yeah, I did.
[15992.07s -> 15998.90s]  You'd be an ocean sunfish.
[15998.90s -> 15999.86s]  Hey, that's kind of cool.
[16000.82s -> 16001.86s]  Ocean sunfish?
[16002.50s -> 16009.25s]  Okay, do they know that this was great?
[16009.25s -> 16009.81s]  Can they see the...
[16009.81s -> 16011.09s]  Okay, they can see the same map.
[16035.03s -> 16035.67s]  Junk.
[16035.67s -> 16043.09s]  All right, now I understand how gas works.
[16043.09s -> 16044.85s]  That's what an ocean sunfish looks like.
[16044.85s -> 16050.85s]  I thought they were going to be this beautiful orange and yellow and fire.
[16051.89s -> 16053.30s]  It's been 10 hours.
[16053.30s -> 16053.78s]  It's going to break.
[16054.42s -> 16057.56s]  Okay, when a mole smells gas nearby, we'll uncover it for you.
[16067.97s -> 16068.29s]  Gas.
[16069.65s -> 16069.97s]  Gas.
[16070.85s -> 16074.07s]  Okay, don't touch the gas.
[16074.79s -> 16088.32s]  Whoa, is that gas?
[16088.88s -> 16091.03s]  I don't know if that's gas or not.
[16091.59s -> 16097.46s]  I hope this is not gas.
[16098.02s -> 16100.26s]  Is it?
[16100.26s -> 16100.90s]  Don't be gas.
[16105.04s -> 16105.52s]  All right, nice.
[16105.52s -> 16106.32s]  We're good.
[16106.32s -> 16117.17s]  All right, hold off.
[16117.17s -> 16117.49s]  Hold off.
[16117.49s -> 16118.37s]  Hold off.
[16118.37s -> 16126.79s]  All right, I need to upgrade this.
[16126.79s -> 16127.27s]  Not yet.
[16127.27s -> 16152.47s]  Hold on.
[16152.47s -> 16155.81s]  Sell it.
[16155.81s -> 16156.21s]  Hurry.
[16158.31s -> 16160.79s]  There's so much to make on that right side right now.
[16160.79s -> 16161.19s]  Thank God.
[16161.19s -> 16161.91s]  All right, we're good.
[16161.91s -> 16166.80s]  Cool.
[16166.80s -> 16171.67s]  All right, I think I'm just going to double this up.
[16171.67s -> 16185.81s]  I'm going to start to get crazy here.
[16185.81s -> 16186.53s]  All right, gas.
[16186.53s -> 16187.33s]  I got to be ready.
[16187.33s -> 16193.92s]  Is it going to start to fill up?
[16194.56s -> 16195.38s]  Fine.
[16195.94s -> 16197.30s]  Both dog shit prices.
[16197.30s -> 16198.82s]  I'm not going to do that.
[16199.54s -> 16200.34s]  Terrible prices.
[16211.99s -> 16213.83s]  Can I get something better than 70 cents, please?
[16214.47s -> 16217.06s]  78.
[16217.06s -> 16217.46s]  Come on.
[16217.46s -> 16218.10s]  That's climbing.
[16222.04s -> 16223.00s]  85.
[16223.00s -> 16223.40s]  All right, go.
[16223.96s -> 16234.28s]  Good haul.
[16234.28s -> 16238.96s]  All right, now where is there more of this shit?
[16238.96s -> 16240.66s]  Could have done the gas.
[16240.66s -> 16241.70s]  I couldn't have done the gas.
[16241.70s -> 16242.74s]  I don't have it on the left side.
[16244.40s -> 16245.36s]  All right, I need some more moles.
[16258.53s -> 16259.75s]  Good.
[16259.75s -> 16260.39s]  Yep.
[16260.39s -> 16261.43s]  Okay, and this is rock.
[16262.15s -> 16265.65s]  Find something over here.
[16265.65s -> 16266.61s]  Let's pray that'd be perfect.
[16267.25s -> 16272.60s]  You're going to do it.
[16272.60s -> 16273.88s]  Go right side.
[16275.40s -> 16281.43s]  Anything?
[16281.43s -> 16283.03s]  Okay, there's something this way.
[16283.03s -> 16285.19s]  There's two gas piles right here.
[16290.77s -> 16291.49s]  How big are they?
[16291.97s -> 16297.86s]  I just got a diamond.
[16297.86s -> 16306.05s]  Nice.
[16306.05s -> 16306.85s]  Don't hit the gas.
[16307.57s -> 16327.27s]  Jit.
[16332.80s -> 16333.44s]  Use the gas.
[16335.38s -> 16336.42s]  It has to go this way.
[16337.14s -> 16339.51s]  It's all just too far away.
[16340.23s -> 16351.40s]  I guess I could put...
[16351.40s -> 16352.12s]  Can I connect?
[16352.12s -> 16352.68s]  I don't know.
[16352.68s -> 16353.88s]  I guess I could connect to here.
[16354.52s -> 16355.32s]  Now it's too far away.
[16360.12s -> 16360.92s]  Hold off.
[16360.92s -> 16361.96s]  Hold off, hold off, hold off.
[16362.68s -> 16363.24s]  Left side.
[16364.28s -> 16365.75s]  Crazy.
[16366.39s -> 16376.32s]  There's so much over here.
[16381.38s -> 16382.98s]  I dicked around way too much at the beginning.
[16391.04s -> 16392.24s]  Okay, I started on the wrong side.
[16392.24s -> 16393.60s]  The left side was so much better.
[16393.60s -> 16399.06s]  The right side was terrible.
[16399.62s -> 16402.18s]  There was two deposits and then no gas.
[16402.18s -> 16404.72s]  That sucked.
[16404.72s -> 16408.28s]  Let's get this out of the way.
[16408.28s -> 16410.20s]  Another 1% 40 grand.
[16410.20s -> 16411.32s]  Imagine clicking on that.
[16412.04s -> 16413.40s]  Just build more oil wells.
[16413.40s -> 16414.52s]  Yeah, I got to build more of those.
[16415.24s -> 16422.26s]  I'll buy it at a dollar.
[16422.26s -> 16435.20s]  Ricardo again.
[16435.20s -> 16435.92s]  All right, that's fine.
[16442.16s -> 16443.92s]  Maybe upgrade the joints.
[16443.92s -> 16444.72s]  I could do three.
[16446.55s -> 16448.23s]  That seems like amazing.
[16448.23s -> 16449.03s]  I think I need this.
[16451.67s -> 16452.55s]  I need that.
[16452.55s -> 16453.75s]  I can go one, two, three.
[16453.75s -> 16455.11s]  The branches just get so much bigger.
[16455.99s -> 16464.77s]  All right, save the rest.
[16465.49s -> 16469.52s]  That's a good upgrade.
[16469.52s -> 16470.02s]  Yeah.
[16470.56s -> 16482.69s]  Right here seems like a good idea.
[16482.69s -> 16484.05s]  Yeah, that's hot real estate right there.
[16484.05s -> 16484.85s]  Come on, dude.
[16484.85s -> 16485.57s]  Really?
[16485.57s -> 16486.13s]  I don't want that.
[16486.85s -> 16491.25s]  All right, I'm good.
[16493.08s -> 16495.24s]  All right, I can do three branches now.
[16495.24s -> 16498.34s]  I want to take my pants off so bad.
[16498.34s -> 16498.90s]  You have no idea.
[16499.54s -> 16500.18s]  Just sit here.
[16501.49s -> 16505.57s]  You can now connect five pipes to each joint.
[16506.29s -> 16527.89s]  Perfect place for gas right there.
[16527.89s -> 16528.69s]  This is a big one.
[16530.32s -> 16531.20s]  All right, I got to plan this out.
[16531.20s -> 16532.08s]  This is a big one.
[16532.08s -> 16533.20s]  Look at how huge this one is.
[16533.68s -> 16536.55s]  So I'm thinking bang, right?
[16536.55s -> 16537.27s]  Like right here.
[16539.11s -> 16543.59s]  Yeah, so it's going to go bang right here.
[16545.06s -> 16546.48s]  Wait, wait.
[16547.12s -> 16552.69s]  Okay, so should I go short and then be able to have...
[16552.69s -> 16555.62s]  Okay, so listen, should I go...
[16556.18s -> 16557.86s]  Just don't go all the way down.
[16557.86s -> 16559.88s]  Should I go a little bit down
[16559.88s -> 16561.56s]  so then I can connect three to that?
[16562.12s -> 16563.91s]  That makes sense, doesn't it?
[16563.91s -> 16569.38s]  See what I'm saying?
[16569.38s -> 16574.53s]  Go like this and then be able to go one, two, three.
[16574.53s -> 16575.25s]  That's not dumb.
[16575.89s -> 16577.70s]  So I go like...
[16578.26s -> 16582.47s]  I'll go this way, right?
[16583.11s -> 16588.28s]  Just kind of one, two, three.
[16588.28s -> 16591.51s]  One, two, three.
[16591.51s -> 16592.55s]  This is the gas line.
[16600.72s -> 16601.68s]  No, I wanted a horse.
[16604.82s -> 16606.26s]  Yeah, so that's the gas line.
[16606.26s -> 16607.22s]  You know what I'm saying?
[16607.86s -> 16609.06s]  This one's going to go this way.
[16609.06s -> 16610.42s]  It could be another gas line.
[16610.42s -> 16612.02s]  He just wasted a year.
[16612.02s -> 16612.42s]  No, I didn't.
[16612.42s -> 16613.22s]  I'm good.
[16613.22s -> 16629.32s]  Same deal with this.
[16629.32s -> 16629.88s]  I don't want to...
[16631.08s -> 16633.27s]  Be careful.
[16633.27s -> 16697.57s]  All right, it's about to get real.
[16697.57s -> 16706.87s]  77 cents is enough.
[16706.87s -> 16709.36s]  Start selling.
[16710.16s -> 16711.76s]  All right, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no.
[16711.76s -> 16720.79s]  Make some moles.
[16727.16s -> 16736.55s]  Two people sell.
[16736.55s -> 16737.99s]  I need the cash flow.
[16737.99s -> 16750.56s]  You know what to do.
[16750.56s -> 16753.65s]  Let's go.
[16753.65s -> 16755.09s]  Everybody, dollar.
[16755.09s -> 16756.02s]  The dollar.
[16762.45s -> 16765.12s]  Nice.
[16765.12s -> 16766.16s]  All right, back over here.
[16766.16s -> 16767.52s]  Right side, 80 cents.
[16767.52s -> 16780.05s]  Hope I don't hit any gas.
[16780.05s -> 16787.16s]  Shit, there's another one right here.
[16787.16s -> 16796.85s]  I need some more horses
[16796.85s -> 16798.92s]  and I need another one of these.
[16798.92s -> 16799.96s]  For sure.
[16800.52s -> 16806.05s]  You know what?
[16806.05s -> 16809.68s]  Just so I don't have a problem.
[16809.68s -> 16823.06s]  So much gas.
[16823.06s -> 16824.18s]  All right, speaking of gas,
[16824.18s -> 16827.81s]  I think it's time to hold.
[16827.81s -> 16832.08s]  Let's store a bunch of shit.
[16832.64s -> 16834.52s]  I'm doing gas
[16834.52s -> 16836.28s]  and I'm dumping it onto the right side here
[16836.28s -> 16837.16s]  in just a little bit.
[16837.16s -> 16848.53s]  Okay, so how am I going to do this?
[16848.53s -> 16852.55s]  I'm thinking, so I connect this through here
[16852.55s -> 16853.67s]  to there, right?
[16853.67s -> 16858.47s]  If I go like that, this.
[16858.47s -> 16861.83s]  Okay, so this is what we're doing.
[16861.83s -> 16864.32s]  Everybody, shh.
[16864.32s -> 16866.32s]  This is going to go like this
[16866.32s -> 16868.47s]  and we're going to start to dump.
[16868.47s -> 16879.28s]  It's dumb, but who cares?
[16879.28s -> 16882.85s]  Wait, I got to be ready.
[16882.85s -> 16883.33s]  I got to do this.
[16884.05s -> 16884.85s]  I'm not ready to do this now.
[16884.85s -> 16885.65s]  Am I ready to do this?
[16889.43s -> 16891.27s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, pause the game.
[16891.27s -> 16891.91s]  What am I doing?
[16892.79s -> 16893.91s]  Okay, this is going to connect.
[16894.76s -> 16896.68s]  It's going to, I got to close the valve
[16905.88s -> 16906.44s]  because it's going to go.
[16906.44s -> 16909.28s]  I have to close this valve.
[16911.88s -> 16914.05s]  Close them now.
[16914.05s -> 16915.57s]  But wait, hold on.
[16915.57s -> 16916.85s]  If the gas comes through here,
[16917.57s -> 16921.19s]  then it needs, this one needs to be closed.
[16921.19s -> 16923.35s]  But no, this has to be closed.
[16923.91s -> 16926.16s]  And that's it.
[16926.88s -> 16929.28s]  So if I do this, I'm just going to try it.
[16929.28s -> 16929.68s]  Who cares?
[16929.68s -> 16930.00s]  Fuck it.
[16930.00s -> 16930.48s]  Here we go.
[16931.20s -> 16932.66s]  You guys ready?
[16933.30s -> 16937.51s]  I fucked it up.
[16937.51s -> 16937.91s]  I blew it.
[16937.91s -> 16938.55s]  I blew it.
[16938.55s -> 16939.59s]  I upgraded the stupid.
[16949.00s -> 16949.64s]  Go!
[16949.64s -> 16968.07s]  I mean, I blew it really bad,
[16968.07s -> 16970.71s]  but I made 27 grand.
[16970.71s -> 16972.23s]  I've really fucked it up.
[16972.23s -> 16975.97s]  Oh, I could have gone up here.
[16976.93s -> 16978.21s]  Is there any more?
[16979.25s -> 16979.89s]  I don't know.
[16979.89s -> 16984.00s]  I thought I blew it.
[16984.64s -> 16993.64s]  No, I got it all.
[16993.64s -> 16993.88s]  Okay.
[16994.52s -> 16995.08s]  What is that?
[16995.08s -> 16996.12s]  Is that a diamond?
[16996.12s -> 16997.17s]  I got it all.
[16997.73s -> 17001.91s]  You only wasted a little bit.
[17001.91s -> 17002.63s]  That wasn't that bad.
[17003.19s -> 17005.40s]  Stop spending money on dumb things.
[17005.40s -> 17006.92s]  I don't even know what that means though.
[17006.92s -> 17008.44s]  Like I'm a dumb person.
[17009.24s -> 17015.14s]  Okay, now the stock auction.
[17015.14s -> 17016.18s]  This is 4%.
[17016.18s -> 17016.98s]  So I'm going to be ready.
[17017.78s -> 17025.80s]  I would be at 16% of the company.
[17026.60s -> 17027.67s]  All right.
[17027.67s -> 17029.03s]  If this goes under 15, I'm doing it.
[17029.75s -> 17037.33s]  Shit.
[17040.02s -> 17041.54s]  Did he buy his own shares back?
[17059.33s -> 17059.89s]  This thing is...
[17060.69s -> 17061.41s]  I need more money.
[17062.69s -> 17066.12s]  Only 1,100 bucks for this.
[17067.08s -> 17067.80s]  I'm going to ask...
[17069.32s -> 17073.41s]  Okay.
[17073.41s -> 17074.13s]  One diamond.
[17075.01s -> 17075.81s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[17076.53s -> 17078.72s]  70 cents on the left.
[17078.72s -> 17078.96s]  No.
[17080.08s -> 17081.12s]  Now it's a loan shit.
[17082.76s -> 17083.64s]  Get the left link.
[17085.35s -> 17086.23s]  Actually a good idea.
[17086.79s -> 17089.94s]  Do I have enough money to...
[17089.94s -> 17090.82s]  Okay, I do.
[17090.82s -> 17091.86s]  I don't want to go broke though.
[17093.11s -> 17094.47s]  I have gas on both sides.
[17100.24s -> 17101.20s]  Ooh, really?
[17101.20s -> 17103.04s]  Okay, no one is going to go that way.
[17103.04s -> 17105.06s]  They're going to think I'm stupid.
[17105.62s -> 17111.88s]  Okay.
[17112.44s -> 17114.26s]  All right.
[17114.26s -> 17118.66s]  Let's do it.
[17118.66s -> 17123.38s]  Use a pipeline to transport gas to left inc.
[17123.38s -> 17124.98s]  And Kyle will raise the oil price.
[17124.98s -> 17125.70s]  Okay.
[17125.70s -> 17128.60s]  So let's be smart.
[17129.32s -> 17132.82s]  And I'm going to stop fast forwarding.
[17132.82s -> 17134.10s]  I feel like it's getting me in trouble.
[17136.21s -> 17136.53s]  Gas.
[17139.48s -> 17140.20s]  Gas in the middle.
[17140.92s -> 17144.98s]  Okay, this is kind of shitty.
[17145.62s -> 17147.75s]  There's a lot of gas.
[17147.75s -> 17150.15s]  Okay, please tell me there's like a big deposit right here.
[17150.15s -> 17154.71s]  Because I could go wham, wham, wham that way and make it like $5 a share.
[17155.35s -> 17188.23s]  There's one down here.
[17188.23s -> 17189.03s]  Shut up.
[17189.03s -> 17189.67s]  Really?
[17189.67s -> 17210.85s]  When I sell to the left Twix, the right Twix starts being a better price.
[17210.85s -> 17215.48s]  Okay, now stop fast forwarding.
[17215.48s -> 17223.48s]  And then I can go wham.
[17223.48s -> 17240.18s]  Gas is here.
[17240.18s -> 17242.50s]  I could go like that, that.
[17242.50s -> 17245.49s]  All right, I got to find something over here.
[17245.49s -> 17248.28s]  I get a little bit this way.
[17248.28s -> 17249.56s]  55 cents.
[17249.56s -> 17250.36s]  Fuck off.
[17250.36s -> 17262.28s]  Bullshit.
[17262.28s -> 17262.60s]  Better.
[17263.16s -> 17274.23s]  Have you people seriously been watching this for 10 and a half hours?
[17274.23s -> 17274.79s]  Not this.
[17275.51s -> 17277.09s]  Only been doing this for about two and a half.
[17277.65s -> 17285.72s]  Okay, I'm just going to go down.
[17289.80s -> 17290.52s]  Start.
[17290.52s -> 17291.48s]  I think this upgraded.
[17292.44s -> 17296.76s]  There's a ton of gas so I could really make like 50 grand if I do this right.
[17296.76s -> 17298.12s]  If I plan this correctly.
[17298.12s -> 17304.31s]  I need more horses.
[17304.95s -> 17307.83s]  All right, this isn't going to be, this is triple now.
[17316.98s -> 17318.34s]  Oh boy, easy.
[17319.22s -> 17332.82s]  Oh my god.
[17332.82s -> 17334.18s]  Okay, it might be time for gas.
[17334.82s -> 17337.86s]  But no, it's not.
[17337.86s -> 17349.16s]  And what am I talking about?
[17349.16s -> 17350.20s]  Dogshit prices.
[17350.20s -> 17351.08s]  Give me a break.
[17351.08s -> 17354.40s]  Can you not be 30 cents?
[17354.96s -> 17355.76s]  Go up.
[17357.36s -> 17358.88s]  Seriously, what is this bullshit?
[17361.04s -> 17362.56s]  Oh boy, oh boy.
[17362.56s -> 17363.12s]  It's gonna break.
[17363.68s -> 17373.68s]  Can I have a gas?
[17373.68s -> 17378.16s]  Do a rig just for gas.
[17378.16s -> 17387.49s]  But when I touch it, doesn't it start going?
[17387.49s -> 17388.29s]  I'm going for this.
[17388.29s -> 17388.93s]  I'm going to try this.
[17389.49s -> 17394.47s]  We'll see if this is a bad idea.
[17395.03s -> 17404.37s]  I'm going to go for gas on the left side here in a second.
[17404.37s -> 17405.73s]  All right, suck up some more oil.
[17406.37s -> 17412.48s]  Okay, here we go.
[17417.67s -> 17418.55s]  Okay, it's time.
[17420.39s -> 17421.27s]  Let's go.
[17421.27s -> 17437.05s]  Let's go.
[17439.92s -> 17442.84s]  Stupid.
[17442.84s -> 17443.34s]  50.
[17444.30s -> 17447.02s]  I got out 50 cents there.
[17451.78s -> 17452.50s]  Shit.
[17452.50s -> 17482.04s]  I'm going bang, bang, bang.
[17482.04s -> 17492.90s]  I have so many silos.
[17492.90s -> 17494.18s]  All right, are you guys ready?
[17494.18s -> 17502.42s]  This is going to be fucking crazy.
[17502.42s -> 17503.46s]  Right side.
[17503.46s -> 17504.54s]  It's November.
[17504.54s -> 17505.58s]  All right, I got to make this happen now.
[17505.58s -> 17506.30s]  Here we go.
[17506.30s -> 17541.70s]  Oh, I didn't even connect that.
[17541.70s -> 17542.74s]  Oh, come on.
[17546.44s -> 17550.36s]  Why do I have to just make 20 grand in the last five seconds?
[17550.36s -> 17552.36s]  Just plan it better.
[17552.36s -> 17559.05s]  Shit, he's pretending.
[17559.05s -> 17560.89s]  I wish that were true.
[17570.86s -> 17571.66s]  3%.
[17571.66s -> 17580.04s]  I'll do it under 10.
[17580.04s -> 17581.00s]  Need to go to bed?
[17581.00s -> 17581.88s]  I'm good.
[17581.88s -> 17586.34s]  All right, I got to be ready.
[17586.34s -> 17587.70s]  Under 10, under 10.
[17588.74s -> 17604.44s]  Ricardo, okay, he's actually climbing moles faster.
[17604.44s -> 17607.62s]  And I'm getting another diamond.
[17607.62s -> 17610.38s]  Close the valve before you drill into the gas.
[17610.94s -> 17612.07s]  I know, dude.
[17612.07s -> 17613.59s]  It's just like when you're on a timer
[17613.59s -> 17623.00s]  and you're a fucking brain slug like me, I get caught up.
[17623.64s -> 17625.90s]  Stop being stupid.
[17625.90s -> 17627.37s]  I know.
[17627.37s -> 17628.17s]  Pause to think.
[17628.17s -> 17631.32s]  When I pause to think, I just go, then I forget.
[17634.50s -> 17635.94s]  I am going to do this though.
[17635.94s -> 17639.86s]  Oh, that's junk.
[17639.86s -> 17640.66s]  Okay.
[17640.66s -> 17643.56s]  Show me where the best one is.
[17647.35s -> 17647.99s]  Oh, okay.
[17647.99s -> 17648.63s]  All right.
[17648.63s -> 17650.78s]  This one's apparently huge.
[17650.78s -> 17652.62s]  Don't bid on that.
[17652.62s -> 17655.10s]  I got to make at least 30 or 40 grand this time.
[17659.74s -> 17678.04s]  My moles are better.
[17678.04s -> 17678.60s]  Good.
[17678.60s -> 17679.48s]  All right, that's a big one.
[17680.04s -> 17680.76s]  Gas right there.
[17682.22s -> 17683.78s]  Gas right there.
[17683.78s -> 17684.98s]  Okay, let's get this started.
[17686.74s -> 17687.38s]  This is perfect.
[17691.77s -> 17692.65s]  What's going to do, straight down?
[17693.21s -> 17703.35s]  Get the horses out already.
[17703.35s -> 17704.47s]  I want to make sure that I already,
[17704.55s -> 17706.31s]  I don't get a bunch of bullshit.
[17706.31s -> 17707.91s]  Look at how much is over there already.
[17707.91s -> 17712.02s]  This is going to be a big head start here.
[17717.00s -> 17719.10s]  That's a head start.
[17719.10s -> 17720.38s]  Actually, probably the best thing that could happen.
[17720.38s -> 17721.18s]  All right, slow down.
[17722.70s -> 17726.97s]  Now, silo right here.
[17729.37s -> 17731.03s]  That's three.
[17731.03s -> 17736.62s]  Okay, two of you start storing.
[17736.62s -> 17743.48s]  Gas here, moles.
[17743.48s -> 17744.60s]  Get back to work over here.
[17746.01s -> 17747.29s]  Got to find something on this side.
[17755.27s -> 17756.79s]  Stop selling over there.
[17756.79s -> 17757.35s]  Just store it.
[17757.99s -> 17762.70s]  Okay, cool.
[17762.70s -> 17763.20s]  All right.
[17764.04s -> 17766.60s]  So, oh shit, people are just sitting there.
[17768.26s -> 17771.59s]  Pause it this way.
[17772.15s -> 17773.13s]  I'm going to do some gas.
[17773.69s -> 17788.68s]  Okay.
[17788.68s -> 17790.20s]  Now, where is it?
[17790.20s -> 17799.91s]  All right, stop, stop, stop.
[17799.91s -> 17803.19s]  I hope that's not gas.
[17803.75s -> 17805.58s]  This here.
[17805.58s -> 17809.58s]  I hope that's not gas.
[17829.61s -> 17830.25s]  Not gas.
[17830.25s -> 17834.07s]  Okay, we're good.
[17834.07s -> 17834.57s]  Okay.
[17837.32s -> 17839.00s]  All right, so this is going to be the gas valve.
[17839.56s -> 17841.27s]  There's another one right there.
[17844.50s -> 17845.22s]  Yeah, fuck that.
[17845.22s -> 17845.94s]  Let's go.
[17845.94s -> 17846.44s]  Pick this up.
[17859.24s -> 17859.88s]  All right.
[17859.88s -> 17860.52s]  Start the flow.
[17860.52s -> 17861.24s]  Come on.
[17861.24s -> 17884.41s]  Fill it up.
[17884.41s -> 17887.80s]  Keep filling it.
[17887.80s -> 17888.12s]  Good.
[17888.12s -> 17888.52s]  5K.
[17888.52s -> 17889.08s]  Let's go.
[17889.08s -> 17889.72s]  Keep going.
[17889.72s -> 17899.85s]  I might do some.
[17899.85s -> 17900.57s]  I got to fill up.
[17900.57s -> 17901.77s]  Let's get another one of these.
[17901.77s -> 17903.91s]  It's only July.
[17903.91s -> 17907.05s]  I'm fine.
[17907.05s -> 17907.85s]  I got 10K.
[17910.87s -> 17912.57s]  All right.
[17912.57s -> 17913.69s]  Start storing it.
[17913.69s -> 17914.57s]  Start storing it.
[17914.57s -> 17916.17s]  Because I want to be able to do a gas run.
[17916.17s -> 17941.30s]  Okay, there's more here.
[17941.30s -> 17946.44s]  August.
[17946.44s -> 17947.00s]  All right.
[17947.00s -> 17951.24s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[17951.24s -> 17951.88s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[17951.88s -> 17952.52s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[17952.52s -> 17953.32s]  Enough, enough, enough, enough.
[17953.32s -> 17954.60s]  All right, let's fucking do this.
[17954.60s -> 17955.72s]  It's September.
[17955.72s -> 17956.52s]  I got a full...
[17957.80s -> 17960.38s]  I got five Mega Man tanks full of energy.
[17960.38s -> 17961.80s]  I'm going for it.
[17961.80s -> 17962.28s]  Here we go.
[17962.28s -> 17963.00s]  Almost.
[17963.00s -> 17963.50s]  Not yet.
[17965.00s -> 17965.72s]  Wait, okay.
[17965.72s -> 17967.72s]  What do I do?
[17967.72s -> 17968.20s]  Here we go.
[17968.20s -> 17968.84s]  All right.
[17968.84s -> 17969.56s]  Wait.
[17969.56s -> 17972.74s]  I want to close.
[17972.74s -> 17973.54s]  What do I want to do?
[17973.54s -> 17974.66s]  Close this one.
[17977.86s -> 17978.98s]  I want to close this.
[17980.70s -> 17981.66s]  Oh, shit.
[17981.66s -> 17982.22s]  Oh, shit.
[17982.78s -> 17983.34s]  Oh, shit.
[17984.60s -> 17985.08s]  Pause it.
[17985.08s -> 17985.48s]  Pause it.
[17985.48s -> 17988.82s]  What do I do?
[17988.82s -> 17990.02s]  This is going to go over here.
[17990.02s -> 17993.26s]  And then I have to close this, right?
[17996.55s -> 17997.51s]  I go over here.
[17997.51s -> 17998.39s]  It sucks it up here.
[17998.39s -> 18001.16s]  And then I close this one.
[18001.16s -> 18003.08s]  And then I'm going to buy a fucking shitload of horses.
[18003.08s -> 18003.88s]  I don't even care about the...
[18004.44s -> 18011.21s]  I don't care.
[18011.21s -> 18011.77s]  Oh, my God.
[18011.77s -> 18012.65s]  I'm going to be in trouble.
[18013.21s -> 18023.87s]  Here we go.
[18099.30s -> 18099.78s]  I got to...
[18099.78s -> 18100.42s]  Okay.
[18100.42s -> 18103.85s]  I'm sure you could use a bit more oil storage capacity.
[18103.85s -> 18104.17s]  Guess what?
[18104.17s -> 18107.06s]  I've invented something for that.
[18107.06s -> 18107.46s]  You do.
[18108.84s -> 18110.04s]  A super silo?
[18110.04s -> 18114.09s]  I don't have enough.
[18114.09s -> 18116.22s]  Oh, man.
[18116.22s -> 18116.94s]  Okay.
[18116.94s -> 18119.10s]  I actually really need that.
[18119.10s -> 18125.38s]  It's over 2% on a whole lot.
[18131.42s -> 18132.06s]  Take the loan.
[18133.77s -> 18135.61s]  I'm scared of the loan because if I take the loan...
[18136.63s -> 18138.31s]  Let's say I take like 10 to 20 grand.
[18139.64s -> 18140.68s]  I have to make sure I can pay it.
[18143.10s -> 18144.25s]  Percent.
[18144.25s -> 18146.01s]  I have to buy the next one no matter what it is.
[18148.04s -> 18148.36s]  All right.
[18156.79s -> 18158.31s]  Should I just take like a $10,000 loan?
[18158.95s -> 18199.58s]  I have to make a big, big, big, big, big one.
[18199.58s -> 18211.70s]  This counts.
[18211.70s -> 18216.28s]  I actually have to get this right.
[18216.28s -> 18216.92s]  Okay.
[18216.92s -> 18218.58s]  That's a good start.
[18218.58s -> 18221.13s]  Really good start.
[18221.13s -> 18222.17s]  No gas yet, though.
[18222.17s -> 18223.13s]  Gas down here.
[18223.13s -> 18225.69s]  We put this here.
[18225.69s -> 18228.10s]  Let's go like this.
[18228.10s -> 18229.54s]  Gas can grab this way.
[18239.82s -> 18244.25s]  Not looking good.
[18245.24s -> 18245.88s]  Make some money.
[18248.63s -> 18249.83s]  This is going to go over here.
[18251.14s -> 18252.18s]  This one's going to go down.
[18255.37s -> 18256.33s]  No, it's not.
[18256.33s -> 18258.47s]  There's no reason to do that right now.
[18258.47s -> 18270.42s]  I know the omega silo.
[18270.42s -> 18271.70s]  The omega silo is going to go over here.
[18271.70s -> 18273.46s]  I just wanted to have more storage.
[18273.46s -> 18286.09s]  Good start.
[18286.09s -> 18286.49s]  Come on.
[18286.49s -> 18287.37s]  Keep it going.
[18287.37s -> 18293.85s]  That's a triple right now.
[18295.70s -> 18296.50s]  Really good start.
[18296.50s -> 18296.82s]  Come on.
[18297.46s -> 18302.23s]  Phenomenal start.
[18302.23s -> 18302.79s]  All right.
[18302.79s -> 18306.97s]  Actually phenomenal start.
[18306.97s -> 18308.01s]  Start storing.
[18308.01s -> 18335.18s]  Let's go straight down.
[18335.18s -> 18335.74s]  Okay.
[18335.74s -> 18336.78s]  Don't sell anything.
[18336.78s -> 18339.46s]  Hold it for another few minutes.
[18339.46s -> 18340.26s]  Go this way.
[18340.26s -> 18343.99s]  Then go this way.
[18343.99s -> 18362.15s]  Some moles out.
[18362.15s -> 18363.05s]  Okay.
[18363.05s -> 18364.33s]  That ain't going anywhere.
[18364.33s -> 18376.15s]  Nothing else down here?
[18376.15s -> 18376.95s]  I need some more moles.
[18376.95s -> 18377.43s]  Get over there.
[18377.43s -> 18379.26s]  Pick that shit out.
[18379.26s -> 18382.52s]  There has to be something over there.
[18382.52s -> 18388.79s]  I don't need money.
[18388.79s -> 18389.51s]  Gas over there.
[18389.51s -> 18389.67s]  Okay.
[18389.67s -> 18390.47s]  Right in the middle.
[18390.47s -> 18396.92s]  Start selling.
[18396.92s -> 18397.80s]  I need the money.
[18397.80s -> 18401.75s]  That was a good time to do it.
[18401.75s -> 18402.39s]  All right.
[18402.39s -> 18403.11s]  Perfect.
[18403.11s -> 18404.33s]  13k.
[18405.19s -> 18416.07s]  Now I don't know if there's anything else over here.
[18416.63s -> 18417.75s]  I'm going to go this way.
[18417.75s -> 18434.14s]  August.
[18434.14s -> 18434.54s]  Okay.
[18434.54s -> 18445.37s]  Good time.
[18445.37s -> 18446.25s]  Dumb ass.
[18446.25s -> 18447.56s]  I'm just kidding.
[18447.56s -> 18450.26s]  I'm not stupid.
[18450.26s -> 18451.14s]  Gas is here.
[18451.14s -> 18457.94s]  There's gas here too.
[18457.94s -> 18458.82s]  Left idiot.
[18458.82s -> 18462.84s]  I don't have any oil.
[18462.84s -> 18470.94s]  Okay.
[18470.94s -> 18472.82s]  This is pumping now.
[18472.82s -> 18473.38s]  Store it.
[18473.38s -> 18480.98s]  I'm getting ready for a gas run.
[18480.98s -> 18482.66s]  Gas run coming up on the right side.
[18482.66s -> 18490.50s]  It's October.
[18490.50s -> 18490.82s]  Okay.
[18490.82s -> 18491.70s]  Time for a gas run.
[18491.70s -> 18500.22s]  Is there any more shit left?
[18500.22s -> 18501.42s]  Oh my God.
[18501.42s -> 18502.30s]  I got to do a gas run now.
[18502.30s -> 18512.14s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[18512.14s -> 18512.62s]  What?
[18512.62s -> 18534.17s]  I think I got it.
[18534.17s -> 18534.89s]  I'm good.
[18534.89s -> 18538.02s]  I think there might be something here.
[18538.58s -> 18539.38s]  Or like down here.
[18539.38s -> 18540.34s]  But I think I got most of it.
[18549.05s -> 18550.57s]  One tiny little thing.
[18550.57s -> 18552.25s]  I paid the debt back.
[18552.25s -> 18552.49s]  All right.
[18552.49s -> 18554.79s]  I got 20 grand.
[18554.79s -> 18557.35s]  I'm consistently making more money than all of them.
[18557.35s -> 18559.19s]  But I have to win this auction.
[18560.78s -> 18561.58s]  2%.
[18561.58s -> 18562.30s]  I have to buy it.
[18580.41s -> 18581.13s]  Stupid.
[18581.13s -> 18582.25s]  I was supposed to click.
[18582.25s -> 18583.13s]  I just couldn't do it.
[18583.13s -> 18584.49s]  I couldn't pull the trigger.
[18584.49s -> 18592.10s]  Right.
[18592.10s -> 18592.42s]  Okay.
[18592.42s -> 18592.90s]  Yep.
[18592.90s -> 18594.94s]  92 cents on the right side.
[18594.94s -> 18595.98s]  That's a huge deal.
[18595.98s -> 18597.26s]  Especially if there's gas.
[18597.26s -> 18613.69s]  Somebody got screwed.
[18613.69s -> 18626.70s]  Did I get scammed?
[18626.70s -> 18626.94s]  Okay.
[18626.94s -> 18627.90s]  No, we're good.
[18627.90s -> 18636.47s]  Thank God.
[18636.47s -> 18638.71s]  Close the well before the gas.
[18638.71s -> 18647.42s]  You're right.
[18647.42s -> 18652.22s]  The right side is not ever going below 91, 92, whatever it was.
[18652.22s -> 18659.69s]  That's a good place for gas.
[18659.69s -> 18660.41s]  All right.
[18660.41s -> 18661.13s]  Come on, man.
[18661.13s -> 18663.29s]  This is going to be huge.
[18663.29s -> 18664.89s]  This is going to be a big deal.
[18664.89s -> 18669.37s]  Go like this.
[18669.37s -> 18673.94s]  I'm going to go wham, wham, wham.
[18673.94s -> 18676.66s]  I'm going to prepare the gas lane first.
[18676.66s -> 18695.46s]  You know what I'm saying?
[18695.46s -> 18715.83s]  Let's go.
[18715.83s -> 18717.18s]  Beautiful.
[18717.18s -> 18717.90s]  Beautiful.
[18717.90s -> 18723.19s]  That's never going to go below 92.
[18723.19s -> 18745.46s]  Good start.
[18745.46s -> 18746.74s]  Very good start.
[18746.74s -> 18761.90s]  Okay.
[18761.90s -> 18764.44s]  I need a silo.
[18764.44s -> 18764.92s]  Yep.
[18764.92s -> 18765.80s]  It's going to go.
[18765.80s -> 18768.12s]  It's going to be an Omega silo going right here.
[18768.12s -> 18776.18s]  Okay.
[18776.18s -> 18776.98s]  Now it's time.
[18780.17s -> 18780.73s]  Yes.
[18780.73s -> 18819.11s]  I went overboard, but it's all right.
[18819.11s -> 18822.15s]  July, we're good.
[18822.15s -> 18822.95s]  Timing's fine.
[18822.95s -> 18844.07s]  There's nothing over here.
[18844.07s -> 18845.64s]  Hold on a second.
[18845.64s -> 18846.36s]  Did you hear this?
[18846.36s -> 18847.00s]  That was kind of...
[18847.00s -> 18847.16s]  All right.
[18847.16s -> 18858.12s]  I almost did it.
[18858.12s -> 18858.68s]  Please.
[18858.68s -> 18860.20s]  Please store it, you dummy.
[18860.20s -> 18861.16s]  It's $1.20.
[18861.16s -> 18868.97s]  It's $1.27 right now.
[18868.97s -> 18869.93s]  Now we store it.
[18869.93s -> 18884.36s]  Is there any more?
[18884.36s -> 18894.39s]  We're empty.
[18894.39s -> 18951.26s]  November?
[18951.26s -> 18953.18s]  Always $25,000.
[18953.18s -> 18957.86s]  Your camera looks like found footage.
[18958.42s -> 18960.63s]  Well, you just found it.
[18960.63s -> 18967.46s]  You're here now, aren't you?
[18967.46s -> 18967.94s]  All right.
[18967.94s -> 18968.82s]  This is very...
[18968.82s -> 18969.54s]  This is important.
[18969.54s -> 18970.18s]  I have to get this.
[18970.74s -> 18973.64s]  I've got the most money.
[18973.64s -> 18977.58s]  This is 6%.
[18977.58s -> 18978.86s]  I have to buy it.
[18978.86s -> 18984.22s]  I'm going to buy it probably around right now.
[18984.22s -> 18990.70s]  Like in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[18991.26s -> 18991.98s]  Fine.
[18991.98s -> 18992.86s]  Six percent.
[18992.86s -> 18995.51s]  I'm at 18%.
[18995.51s -> 19010.97s]  I can afford the horses though,
[19010.97s -> 19012.97s]  but I haven't really been using them that much.
[19023.62s -> 19026.02s]  Bright Ink is never going under $1.01.
[19030.39s -> 19030.79s]  All right.
[19030.79s -> 19031.91s]  Give me something good here.
[19032.55s -> 19040.07s]  Where?
[19040.07s -> 19041.22s]  I don't know.
[19041.22s -> 19050.17s]  This is right next to a $24,000 though.
[19050.17s -> 19051.05s]  That might suck.
[19051.05s -> 19060.60s]  Maybe right here.
[19060.60s -> 19061.40s]  Top middle.
[19061.40s -> 19073.45s]  This is probably the safest place that are over here.
[19074.17s -> 19077.42s]  It's not a shitty one.
[19078.14s -> 19091.30s]  We really want to uncover right because
[19093.83s -> 19095.27s]  that's where we're going to spend most of the time.
[19095.27s -> 19095.67s]  Gas.
[19095.67s -> 19096.31s]  Two gases.
[19097.94s -> 19098.18s]  Okay.
[19098.18s -> 19100.02s]  I could make up literally everything right now.
[19100.02s -> 19102.25s]  This is going to be a huge fucking deal.
[19102.25s -> 19102.73s]  Okay.
[19102.73s -> 19103.85s]  This is a big deal.
[19103.85s -> 19105.53s]  Here we go.
[19105.53s -> 19107.21s]  Let me plan this.
[19107.77s -> 19112.49s]  If I go here, I can go one.
[19112.49s -> 19198.28s]  I need to take a loan out.
[19198.28s -> 19199.37s]  Gas.
[19199.37s -> 19200.09s]  Gas.
[19200.09s -> 19204.52s]  Here's the plan.
[19204.52s -> 19208.50s]  The plan is to go here and then here.
[19208.50s -> 19212.66s]  And that's going to, I mean, you could have a million dollars.
[19212.66s -> 19237.40s]  All right.
[19237.40s -> 19250.01s]  Maybe we should start the storage process now.
[19250.01s -> 19263.11s]  Whoa, half and half.
[19263.11s -> 19265.99s]  So I'm going to use store because I need to have enough for the gas.
[19265.99s -> 19273.14s]  11 hours.
[19273.14s -> 19273.54s]  Oh shit.
[19273.54s -> 19274.02s]  Nice.
[19274.02s -> 19281.94s]  Okay.
[19281.94s -> 19283.86s]  Should I store now in June?
[19283.86s -> 19284.66s]  Let's fill up one of these.
[19284.66s -> 19285.86s]  Let's fill the super silo up.
[19285.86s -> 19300.79s]  Perfect.
[19300.79s -> 19315.02s]  Perfect.
[19315.02s -> 19317.72s]  Dude, gas.
[19317.72s -> 19318.66s]  Three gases.
[19319.22s -> 19319.70s]  It's August.
[19319.70s -> 19319.94s]  All right.
[19319.94s -> 19320.90s]  I got to be ready.
[19320.90s -> 19334.94s]  Store everything.
[19334.94s -> 19340.92s]  It's August.
[19340.92s -> 19341.48s]  Okay.
[19341.48s -> 19342.28s]  Here we go.
[19342.28s -> 19346.54s]  Okay.
[19346.54s -> 19347.26s]  All right.
[19347.26s -> 19351.75s]  So now this is almost sucked up.
[19351.75s -> 19354.34s]  Two super silos.
[19354.34s -> 19364.66s]  I got one, two, three gases.
[19364.66s -> 19378.62s]  You're going to fuck it up?
[19378.62s -> 19378.86s]  All right.
[19378.86s -> 19379.50s]  Let's fucking go.
[19379.50s -> 19380.22s]  You ready?
[19380.22s -> 19382.34s]  I've got two months to do this.
[19382.34s -> 19386.10s]  I got two super silos full of fucking stuff.
[19386.10s -> 19386.65s]  All right.
[19386.65s -> 19387.21s]  It's November.
[19387.21s -> 19387.61s]  Here we go.
[19389.16s -> 19390.65s]  Pause it.
[19390.65s -> 19393.18s]  So this is going this way.
[19393.26s -> 19394.38s]  It sucks up here.
[19394.38s -> 19396.47s]  Just close this.
[19396.47s -> 19399.74s]  This one's going to go this way.
[19399.74s -> 19401.26s]  Close this.
[19401.26s -> 19401.58s]  Fuck it.
[19401.58s -> 19402.14s]  Whatever.
[19402.14s -> 19403.10s]  Who cares?
[19403.10s -> 19406.76s]  This is going to come up here.
[19406.76s -> 19412.15s]  I think this is correct.
[19412.15s -> 19413.19s]  Just close the rig.
[19413.19s -> 19414.47s]  Don't do anything else.
[19414.47s -> 19417.13s]  Just close the top and yolo it.
[19417.13s -> 19417.93s]  Just close the rig.
[19417.93s -> 19418.49s]  Just close the rig.
[19418.49s -> 19421.32s]  Don't do anything else.
[19421.32s -> 19422.12s]  Just close this.
[19424.55s -> 19426.62s]  All you have to do is close the rig.
[19426.62s -> 19427.02s]  That's it.
[19449.21s -> 19449.77s]  My God.
[19463.67s -> 19467.29s]  Oh, clean 50K.
[19467.29s -> 19472.02s]  That's a clean 50K right there.
[19472.02s -> 19472.98s]  Oh, that feels good.
[19473.62s -> 19474.58s]  I'm good to go.
[19474.58s -> 19477.77s]  I don't think there's any more oil.
[19483.08s -> 19484.12s]  Actually, there might be one over here.
[19484.12s -> 19484.68s]  One right here.
[19485.24s -> 19486.46s]  But I'll take 50,000.
[19486.46s -> 19486.94s]  I don't care.
[19497.46s -> 19498.02s]  All right.
[19498.02s -> 19499.90s]  I'm way ahead now.
[19505.75s -> 19506.87s]  Bank's going to be looking to me.
[19507.51s -> 19508.87s]  Get loaned some money.
[19508.87s -> 19518.18s]  All right.
[19518.18s -> 19521.46s]  I was a little more efficient this year.
[19521.46s -> 19524.34s]  My pipes were not $38,000.
[19524.34s -> 19526.26s]  They were just $3,800.
[19526.26s -> 19534.62s]  Our mole expenses obviously are pretty good.
[19535.18s -> 19540.31s]  Sounds good.
[19545.16s -> 19545.48s]  3%.
[19546.82s -> 19548.66s]  Not unless it comes way down here.
[19548.66s -> 19550.15s]  I'm pretty far ahead.
[19552.94s -> 19554.70s]  Ricardo's the only one that I'm worried about.
[19554.70s -> 19555.82s]  I might just snipe it from him.
[19556.46s -> 19561.86s]  If it goes underneath 20.
[19568.01s -> 19569.37s]  That's 3% more.
[19569.37s -> 19571.72s]  About 21%.
[19571.72s -> 19571.88s]  All right.
[19571.88s -> 19574.04s]  I'm 10% higher than Ricardo.
[19574.04s -> 19575.64s]  That's all I care about.
[19575.64s -> 19579.78s]  Should I finish some of this stuff?
[19579.78s -> 19580.18s]  Hold on.
[19582.94s -> 19583.82s]  Longer timer.
[19583.82s -> 19584.54s]  I think I need it.
[19584.54s -> 19585.82s]  But what else can I do?
[19585.82s -> 19590.39s]  Oh, 79 cents.
[19591.19s -> 19598.06s]  He's never going to do scanner.
[19601.72s -> 19602.68s]  Expense too expensive.
[19605.58s -> 19610.81s]  I'm going to hold on to the money.
[19635.83s -> 19637.59s]  Right here or right here?
[19638.31s -> 19639.83s]  Everyone's going to go for right here.
[19639.83s -> 19640.47s]  Going this way.
[19647.03s -> 19647.51s]  Dickhead.
[19659.61s -> 19660.73s]  Thanks to the timer upgrade,
[19660.73s -> 19663.45s]  rigs will now take longer before they spill over.
[19663.45s -> 19677.42s]  Good.
[19677.42s -> 19687.70s]  Right side's looking pretty juicy.
[19687.70s -> 19689.70s]  There's nothing over on the left side.
[19689.70s -> 19690.42s]  Nothing.
[19690.42s -> 19709.93s]  That's good for me, I guess.
[19709.93s -> 19719.96s]  Gas are already right there.
[19719.96s -> 19731.46s]  Hold off.
[19731.46s -> 19732.90s]  Mega silo going to go over here.
[19732.90s -> 19743.61s]  Store it for now.
[19743.61s -> 19744.57s]  Any more horses.
[19744.57s -> 19750.55s]  Geez, 134.
[19750.55s -> 19751.11s]  Are you kidding me?
[19751.11s -> 19752.07s]  What's going on here?
[19752.07s -> 19754.23s]  What's going on with these prices?
[19754.23s -> 19756.92s]  Jesus.
[19756.92s -> 19771.00s]  Is there really nothing over on the left side?
[19771.00s -> 19786.89s]  Okay, this one's something right there.
[19786.89s -> 19787.45s]  All right.
[19787.45s -> 19793.64s]  Silo time.
[19793.64s -> 19805.11s]  85 cents over there.
[19805.11s -> 19805.59s]  Sell.
[19805.59s -> 19817.10s]  That's a lot of money.
[19817.10s -> 19818.70s]  Start the storage process.
[19818.70s -> 19819.42s]  Left side.
[19819.42s -> 19820.70s]  Yeah, sell it on the left side.
[19820.70s -> 19827.46s]  Why not?
[19827.46s -> 19829.14s]  Okay, I got 11 grand.
[19829.14s -> 19837.26s]  Start storing two omega silos.
[19837.26s -> 19850.68s]  I'm happy with that.
[19850.68s -> 19851.48s]  Hit the right side.
[19854.50s -> 19855.38s]  Okay, fine.
[19855.38s -> 19860.81s]  It's a sure thing.
[19860.81s -> 19861.05s]  All right.
[19861.05s -> 19861.61s]  I need more.
[19862.49s -> 19868.66s]  I'm out of juice here.
[19868.66s -> 19869.70s]  I'm out of juice.
[19869.70s -> 19899.38s]  Where do I go?
[19899.38s -> 19902.07s]  Gas.
[19902.71s -> 19906.44s]  It's blanked so hard.
[19906.44s -> 19907.70s]  Okay, wait a minute.
[19907.70s -> 19908.66s]  It's December.
[19908.66s -> 19944.17s]  We're good.
[19944.17s -> 19951.10s]  It's a little scary, but we're fine.
[19951.10s -> 19952.06s]  21%.
[19952.06s -> 19952.38s]  All right.
[19952.38s -> 19953.90s]  We're almost at the last part.
[19953.90s -> 19956.94s]  3% again.
[19957.58s -> 19963.22s]  So wait, there's only 100% of the shares are being sold.
[19964.02s -> 19967.72s]  So let me take inventory here because I think I could.
[19967.72s -> 19969.72s]  So I could seal the win, couldn't I?
[19970.44s -> 19974.07s]  With a certain percentage.
[19976.81s -> 19977.93s]  All right, Ricardo got it.
[19979.62s -> 19980.18s]  21.
[19983.37s -> 19986.94s]  When is it mathematically not possible for either one of these to win?
[19986.94s -> 19988.14s]  I just have to get to 51.
[19988.14s -> 19993.58s]  Oh, what if I can't get to 51?
[19993.58s -> 19998.31s]  20, 30, 31, 35.
[19999.03s -> 20009.06s]  So 42% of the shares are out right now.
[20009.06s -> 20010.42s]  You land before stock.
[20010.42s -> 20012.47s]  Why?
[20012.47s -> 20014.95s]  You need a majority or a plurality.
[20014.95s -> 20029.26s]  They have, it's less money each.
[20029.82s -> 20030.38s]  Really?
[20030.38s -> 20031.26s]  Okay, I didn't know that.
[20031.90s -> 20034.81s]  Interesting.
[20034.81s -> 20035.45s]  All right, what do you got?
[20038.07s -> 20039.27s]  80 cents left ink.
[20039.27s -> 20040.07s]  I think it's worth it.
[20045.88s -> 20046.52s]  More horses.
[20047.24s -> 20052.98s]  Timer three.
[20052.98s -> 20053.46s]  No, okay.
[20053.46s -> 20054.66s]  So I have more horses now.
[20055.38s -> 20057.93s]  All right, there's only two more rounds in this.
[20057.93s -> 20058.65s]  Then where's the home stretch?
[20064.57s -> 20065.05s]  You know what?
[20065.05s -> 20068.01s]  I'm going to...
[20068.01s -> 20069.77s]  Yeah, I'm bidding you on here.
[20069.77s -> 20070.33s]  That's 38.
[20070.33s -> 20071.05s]  This might be 40.
[20073.19s -> 20073.99s]  Yeah, this is mine.
[20074.55s -> 20087.34s]  Fuck all of you.
[20087.98s -> 20088.30s]  Fine.
[20088.30s -> 20089.02s]  There's nothing in there.
[20090.14s -> 20091.66s]  You're going to find an old shoe.
[20092.46s -> 20111.69s]  25 wagons.
[20111.69s -> 20119.13s]  Oh, left side was the one that's going to be good for what we're trying to do, right?
[20119.13s -> 20120.97s]  Left side is can't go under a certain amount.
[20121.77s -> 20122.49s]  Diamond.
[20122.49s -> 20125.78s]  I want to see more.
[20143.46s -> 20144.58s]  Big one over there.
[20144.58s -> 20145.70s]  All right, let's just get some money.
[20146.42s -> 20152.04s]  Okay.
[20152.76s -> 20175.88s]  Come on, man.
[20175.88s -> 20176.60s]  Hurry up.
[20176.60s -> 20177.80s]  150.
[20177.80s -> 20178.76s]  Come on.
[20178.76s -> 20182.71s]  You're killing me here.
[20182.71s -> 20183.11s]  Thank you.
[20183.83s -> 20187.21s]  Don't shut that valve off.
[20187.21s -> 20209.03s]  Nothing.
[20209.03s -> 20211.32s]  Should I get some more moles?
[20211.32s -> 20221.62s]  Yeah.
[20221.62s -> 20221.94s]  Gas.
[20223.83s -> 20224.31s]  Good.
[20224.31s -> 20224.87s]  Okay.
[20224.87s -> 20228.90s]  I can do a double gas on the left, which would be awesome.
[20228.90s -> 20248.20s]  Shit.
[20266.49s -> 20268.73s]  I mean, it was crazy what I just did, but whatever.
[20269.37s -> 20269.77s]  August.
[20269.77s -> 20270.41s]  All right, we're good.
[20271.29s -> 20274.94s]  Not enough oil to really do a silo.
[20275.58s -> 20277.62s]  I might just do gas now.
[20278.18s -> 20287.88s]  I'm doing gas now.
[20287.88s -> 20295.90s]  It's September, man.
[20295.90s -> 20296.62s]  It's September already.
[20297.26s -> 20308.04s]  I'm doing gas now.
[20308.04s -> 20308.84s]  Let's go.
[20308.84s -> 20321.78s]  Oh, there's a...
[20321.86s -> 20322.10s]  Whatever.
[20322.10s -> 20322.74s]  There's a rock here.
[20322.74s -> 20323.62s]  That's fine.
[20323.62s -> 20340.20s]  I can do it again.
[20340.20s -> 20341.40s]  Not bad considering.
[20341.40s -> 20342.20s]  I'll be honest.
[20342.20s -> 20343.32s]  Not bad considering.
[20343.32s -> 20353.40s]  Is there any more oil?
[20353.40s -> 20354.12s]  There is down here.
[20354.12s -> 20357.99s]  I want a thousand bucks.
[20357.99s -> 20359.67s]  One little spot left, but I got the thousand.
[20359.67s -> 20364.73s]  11 and a half hours.
[20364.73s -> 20365.13s]  Damn.
[20365.13s -> 20365.77s]  This is what?
[20365.77s -> 20369.66s]  Almost the second longest stream ever.
[20369.66s -> 20370.54s]  Getting there.
[20370.54s -> 20375.91s]  Okay.
[20375.91s -> 20377.51s]  Land auction first.
[20382.47s -> 20383.82s]  The last one here.
[20384.38s -> 20389.61s]  Did Ricardo literally have like no money there?
[20389.61s -> 20393.22s]  I'll go here.
[20393.22s -> 20399.18s]  I'll take the terrible one.
[20399.18s -> 20399.66s]  That's okay.
[20400.38s -> 20405.56s]  2% 40.
[20405.56s -> 20405.88s]  All right.
[20406.92s -> 20407.96s]  Ricardo's broke.
[20407.96s -> 20409.32s]  Can I buy him out?
[20412.92s -> 20413.16s]  Okay.
[20413.72s -> 20415.56s]  If Blanche buys this, I don't care.
[20416.44s -> 20417.00s]  It's nothing.
[20418.49s -> 20421.21s]  But if it does go below 10 grand, I'm sniping it
[20421.21s -> 20422.57s]  because Ricardo's going to try to get it.
[20423.37s -> 20426.33s]  I'll go for a snipe.
[20432.25s -> 20432.89s]  Sorry.
[20432.89s -> 20434.33s]  Blanche, you have 2%.
[20434.33s -> 20435.45s]  Congratulations.
[20435.45s -> 20444.58s]  I'm saving money.
[20444.58s -> 20446.18s]  There's no reason to do anything crazy.
[20446.18s -> 20447.94s]  This is one of the shittiest plots.
[20447.94s -> 20463.70s]  Not bad.
[20464.34s -> 20465.54s]  Not bad gas placement.
[20465.54s -> 20471.51s]  Just need a loan.
[20471.51s -> 20492.28s]  This one's going to have nothing in it.
[20492.28s -> 20492.68s]  It's fine.
[20493.40s -> 20502.22s]  Okay.
[20507.14s -> 20508.26s]  Gas right here.
[20508.34s -> 20513.59s]  This might be gas over here too.
[20513.59s -> 20514.47s]  I don't really care though.
[20515.27s -> 20515.83s]  Nice.
[20515.83s -> 20516.15s]  All right.
[20516.15s -> 20516.87s]  That was a good find.
[20549.90s -> 20550.30s]  All right.
[20550.30s -> 20553.50s]  Horses are good.
[20553.50s -> 20555.58s]  Take some money for a little bit.
[20555.58s -> 20556.94s]  If I leave here with 10 grand, I'm fine.
[20569.06s -> 20569.62s]  Okay.
[20569.62s -> 20572.57s]  Now, get some mole action here.
[20572.57s -> 20583.80s]  I'm good.
[20585.82s -> 20586.78s]  Why you?
[20586.78s -> 20587.02s]  Why?
[20591.48s -> 20592.04s]  Looking good.
[20592.60s -> 20600.10s]  I got three gases here.
[20600.10s -> 20602.84s]  Okay.
[20602.84s -> 20603.96s]  Three gases.
[20603.96s -> 20610.54s]  Sell a little bit.
[20611.35s -> 20612.23s]  Sell a little bit.
[20612.23s -> 20621.29s]  September.
[20621.29s -> 20623.29s]  It's almost time to activate the gas.
[20623.29s -> 20638.55s]  Build a silo up for another month.
[20638.55s -> 20649.99s]  All right.
[20649.99s -> 20651.43s]  I want one full silo.
[20653.26s -> 20654.22s]  And then I'm just grabbing gas.
[20654.22s -> 20655.74s]  I'm going to grab gas everywhere.
[20655.74s -> 20657.35s]  Okay.
[20657.35s -> 20657.67s]  Here we go.
[20657.67s -> 20658.15s]  Let's just do it.
[20686.42s -> 20687.22s]  Don't go yet.
[20687.22s -> 20687.86s]  Don't go yet.
[20702.23s -> 20703.11s]  Pretty good.
[20703.11s -> 20704.63s]  Pretty good for Africa.
[20704.63s -> 20705.91s]  Pretty good considering.
[20705.91s -> 20706.79s]  Pretty good considering.
[20708.87s -> 20709.51s]  Oh my god.
[20709.51s -> 20710.31s]  That was a huge one.
[20710.31s -> 20710.71s]  I didn't see it.
[20710.71s -> 20711.51s]  Whatever.
[20711.51s -> 20712.63s]  Pretty good considering.
[20712.63s -> 20715.05s]  What did I say?
[20715.05s -> 20715.85s]  I want a 10 grand from that.
[20715.85s -> 20719.06s]  That'll be fine.
[20719.06s -> 20721.62s]  I would be totally happy with 10 grand.
[20721.62s -> 20725.75s]  My factory is new equipment on offer
[20725.75s -> 20727.67s]  to increase the size of gas pockets.
[20728.31s -> 20728.71s]  What?
[20730.76s -> 20731.40s]  Winter is coming.
[20731.40s -> 20733.00s]  We're moving to the snow area.
[20733.00s -> 20734.44s]  At a smaller gas pockets.
[20734.44s -> 20735.72s]  But there's a way to make them bigger.
[20736.60s -> 20738.44s]  All right.
[20738.44s -> 20738.84s]  This is it.
[20739.56s -> 20759.19s]  75 cents.
[20759.91s -> 20764.52s]  86 cents on the right side.
[20764.52s -> 20765.16s]  That's good.
[20765.16s -> 20765.88s]  I'm going to take it.
[20766.68s -> 20771.70s]  We're going to get the best plot in the game.
[20772.26s -> 20774.42s]  So I got to be prepared for this.
[20775.43s -> 20775.83s]  Thermal.
[20780.58s -> 20783.54s]  Activate all joints in a pipeline that encircles gas.
[20783.54s -> 20785.38s]  This will cause the gas to expand.
[20793.11s -> 20797.48s]  I don't know if we're going to do that.
[20798.28s -> 20800.87s]  Drilling faster.
[20800.87s -> 20801.99s]  Yeah, that's huge.
[20802.71s -> 20803.67s]  Drill faster.
[20803.75s -> 20805.67s]  It takes so goddamn long.
[20805.67s -> 20807.11s]  I might take a loan out for this.
[20807.91s -> 20813.51s]  All right.
[20813.51s -> 20814.47s]  Well, apparently this is it.
[20815.03s -> 20820.95s]  This is probably this is one of the best ones.
[20820.95s -> 20825.45s]  Two percent.
[20825.45s -> 20830.94s]  Just go all in on the first run.
[20831.50s -> 20832.38s]  That's the plan.
[20848.10s -> 20848.66s]  Daisy.
[20848.66s -> 20849.06s]  Really?
[20849.06s -> 20850.50s]  I was waiting for it to get whatever.
[20850.50s -> 20857.29s]  Let's do it.
[20857.29s -> 20858.17s]  I got to go all in.
[20858.17s -> 20870.42s]  This is apparently one of the best plots
[20870.42s -> 20871.78s]  in the entire video game.
[20871.78s -> 20877.69s]  So I got to get this right.
[20877.69s -> 20878.41s]  Holy shit.
[20878.41s -> 20879.85s]  Look at that right side.
[20879.85s -> 20881.21s]  What side is never going to go under?
[20881.69s -> 20882.49s]  Which one is it?
[20882.49s -> 20883.45s]  Right side?
[20883.45s -> 20885.45s]  That's awesome if that's true.
[20895.05s -> 20895.77s]  Right side.
[20895.77s -> 20896.41s]  Perfect.
[20896.41s -> 20917.22s]  Look at how big this is.
[20917.22s -> 20918.50s]  I got to go double here.
[20918.50s -> 20931.91s]  Should I connect these?
[20931.91s -> 20936.94s]  Just connect them.
[20936.94s -> 20938.34s]  Where is that?
[20938.34s -> 20939.14s]  That idea.
[20939.14s -> 20940.26s]  No, just go right in.
[20940.26s -> 20942.38s]  I'm just going to go right in.
[20942.38s -> 20948.09s]  I could run.
[20948.09s -> 20950.01s]  I could absolutely run away with it.
[20950.01s -> 20956.68s]  Now, forget about the right side.
[20956.68s -> 20957.32s]  The left side, I mean.
[20957.88s -> 20983.06s]  Okay.
[20983.06s -> 20983.70s]  All right.
[20983.70s -> 20996.98s]  I don't see any gas.
[20996.98s -> 21004.06s]  A little bit of gas here.
[21004.06s -> 21007.93s]  Already at 16K and it's June.
[21008.73s -> 21060.49s]  Start storing.
[21060.49s -> 21062.84s]  It's only July.
[21062.84s -> 21063.40s]  We're good.
[21063.40s -> 21076.02s]  It's August.
[21076.02s -> 21076.82s]  It's August.
[21076.82s -> 21077.86s]  Oh, okay.
[21077.86s -> 21078.50s]  Gas time.
[21078.50s -> 21081.08s]  Gas on the right side or left side.
[21081.08s -> 21082.86s]  It doesn't matter.
[21082.86s -> 21084.76s]  Um, hold on.
[21084.76s -> 21097.77s]  What side?
[21097.77s -> 21106.42s]  Right side, I think.
[21106.42s -> 21106.98s]  Shit.
[21106.98s -> 21107.46s]  What side?
[21107.46s -> 21108.10s]  What do I do?
[21108.10s -> 21108.82s]  What side?
[21108.82s -> 21109.38s]  I'm going to go.
[21109.38s -> 21110.79s]  All right.
[21110.79s -> 21112.63s]  I have no way to put anything.
[21127.58s -> 21127.90s]  All right.
[21127.90s -> 21128.70s]  All right, all right, all right.
[21128.70s -> 21129.18s]  Slow down.
[21129.18s -> 21132.23s]  Slow down.
[21132.23s -> 21133.03s]  Um, okay.
[21133.03s -> 21144.01s]  So 38 cents.
[21144.01s -> 21237.96s]  Not doing that yet.
[21237.96s -> 21239.32s]  You can't be serious.
[21239.32s -> 21240.12s]  It's fine.
[21240.12s -> 21241.08s]  I got to look at this.
[21241.08s -> 21243.94s]  I'm untouchable right now.
[21243.94s -> 21249.59s]  Almost 100K.
[21249.59s -> 21252.10s]  And the diamond.
[21252.10s -> 21253.51s]  We're doing that again.
[21253.51s -> 21254.47s]  81 cents on left.
[21254.47s -> 21255.11s]  You think it's worth it?
[21256.76s -> 21257.56s]  Yeah.
[21257.56s -> 21259.16s]  Anything over 80 I think is worth it.
[21259.16s -> 21271.74s]  That's mine.
[21272.22s -> 21273.98s]  I'm willing to pay at least 10 grand for this.
[21274.78s -> 21275.86s]  Sorry, Daisy.
[21276.66s -> 21284.30s]  Thank you.
[21290.07s -> 21291.19s]  Everyone's broke.
[21291.19s -> 21294.36s]  Look at how broke everybody is.
[21294.36s -> 21295.00s]  Four percent.
[21297.16s -> 21298.20s]  I can just sit here and wait.
[21300.06s -> 21300.38s]  All right.
[21300.38s -> 21302.14s]  I think I'm comfortable taking four percent
[21302.14s -> 21304.14s]  when this goes to 20K just to seal it.
[21305.02s -> 21309.66s]  Right before 20K.
[21310.38s -> 21323.30s]  25 percent.
[21323.30s -> 21326.73s]  And drilling speed.
[21330.36s -> 21331.72s]  I can do drilling speed.
[21331.72s -> 21332.36s]  I could do...
[21333.16s -> 21335.45s]  Finally get the scanner.
[21336.17s -> 21338.25s]  All right.
[21338.25s -> 21339.05s]  I got the scanner.
[21341.51s -> 21347.27s]  I'm going to upgrade the scanner size twice.
[21347.27s -> 21358.46s]  This thing better be worth it.
[21359.34s -> 21368.98s]  Try our new scanner.
[21368.98s -> 21370.42s]  Click the scanner icon.
[21370.42s -> 21373.80s]  Point your mouse cursor in the ground.
[21373.80s -> 21375.40s]  Wait until the size is right
[21375.40s -> 21377.00s]  and then click the reveal area.
[21377.96s -> 21381.62s]  What side do I want to be on?
[21381.62s -> 21381.86s]  Left?
[21389.83s -> 21390.39s]  What happened?
[21390.39s -> 21390.87s]  I just...
[21390.87s -> 21391.67s]  It's cost...
[21391.67s -> 21394.50s]  Oh, okay.
[21394.50s -> 21395.14s]  Left side, right?
[21412.09s -> 21412.81s]  Are you kidding me?
[21413.37s -> 21429.21s]  It's only 100 bucks to start that.
[21429.21s -> 21453.96s]  All right.
[21453.96s -> 21454.92s]  I got more horses.
[21454.92s -> 21464.98s]  I'm going to start to overflow a little flow here.
[21464.98s -> 21466.42s]  No, guys.
[21466.90s -> 21472.90s]  Okay.
[21472.90s -> 21473.38s]  I'm good.
[21473.38s -> 21489.46s]  Start some storage here.
[21489.46s -> 21502.70s]  Right side.
[21502.70s -> 21513.35s]  No.
[21513.35s -> 21514.39s]  Oh, my God.
[21514.39s -> 21516.87s]  This thing is fucking crazy.
[21516.87s -> 21518.58s]  There's no gas in this level.
[21518.58s -> 21524.63s]  Why did I buy those upgrades?
[21524.63s -> 21551.61s]  What was the point of that?
[21551.61s -> 21552.01s]  Sell.
[21553.83s -> 21555.03s]  Boy, that goes down.
[21555.03s -> 21583.00s]  Does rock crush?
[21583.00s -> 21612.95s]  Store, store, store, store, store, store, store, store, store.
[21612.95s -> 21620.49s]  The scanner is broken.
[21620.49s -> 21625.05s]  It's so good.
[21625.05s -> 21625.61s]  Gas.
[21625.61s -> 21626.01s]  All right.
[21626.01s -> 21626.81s]  What about down here?
[21626.81s -> 21632.54s]  All right.
[21632.54s -> 21633.98s]  We got double gas down here.
[21633.98s -> 21637.14s]  I need another omega silo
[21637.14s -> 21642.42s]  and we're going to get ready for the December.
[21642.42s -> 21642.82s]  Okay.
[21642.90s -> 21644.02s]  Don't sell anything.
[21644.02s -> 21645.06s]  Store only.
[21645.06s -> 21645.70s]  Forever.
[21645.70s -> 21669.75s]  Here's one.
[21669.75s -> 21677.18s]  We're going to go wham, wham and go to bed.
[21677.18s -> 21687.10s]  I'll go to bed when I break my streaming world record.
[21687.10s -> 21687.90s]  This is it over here.
[21687.90s -> 21688.14s]  All right.
[21688.14s -> 21688.46s]  This is it.
[21688.46s -> 21689.26s]  I got to focus on here.
[21693.46s -> 21694.58s]  There's three gases.
[21694.58s -> 21701.94s]  There's one, two, three.
[21701.94s -> 21702.18s]  All right.
[21702.18s -> 21702.82s]  Prepare.
[21702.82s -> 21721.48s]  September.
[21721.48s -> 21725.42s]  Don't drop down to 20 cents.
[21725.42s -> 21726.38s]  Oh, my God.
[21726.38s -> 21729.61s]  What a disaster.
[21729.61s -> 21731.61s]  I can ride this out till November.
[21731.61s -> 21740.14s]  Okay.
[21740.14s -> 21740.78s]  Here we go.
[21740.78s -> 21776.71s]  Was that $75,000?
[21776.71s -> 21777.75s]  $65,000.
[21781.10s -> 21782.30s]  Oh, I didn't get it all.
[21782.30s -> 21782.70s]  Shit.
[21782.70s -> 21784.36s]  Oops.
[21784.36s -> 21785.72s]  I forgot it was closed.
[21785.72s -> 21786.12s]  It's all right.
[21786.12s -> 21787.24s]  I'll take $63,000.
[21787.24s -> 21788.28s]  What am I over $100,000?
[21788.28s -> 21794.26s]  All right.
[21794.26s -> 21796.26s]  I'm on track to beat the game for sure.
[21796.26s -> 21798.25s]  Do I have any more diamonds?
[21801.61s -> 21801.85s]  All right.
[21801.85s -> 21803.77s]  Yeah, I'm $73,000.
[21809.78s -> 21810.82s]  Everybody wants this one.
[21811.38s -> 21813.32s]  Do you think this one here?
[21813.32s -> 21813.72s]  Which one?
[21813.72s -> 21814.12s]  Down here?
[21818.10s -> 21818.90s]  I'm going to save this one.
[21818.90s -> 21819.94s]  This is probably safe.
[21819.94s -> 21825.21s]  Or this one here.
[21827.10s -> 21828.62s]  Left up like this one.
[21829.18s -> 21832.25s]  Right of $73,000.
[21834.95s -> 21836.15s]  This like up here.
[21836.15s -> 21836.63s]  That's too good.
[21836.63s -> 21837.83s]  That's close to $34,000 though.
[21837.83s -> 21838.63s]  That could be scary.
[21840.46s -> 21841.98s]  That could actually be scary.
[21841.98s -> 21843.54s]  What's wrong with my elbow?
[21844.26s -> 21846.81s]  What is that?
[21847.53s -> 21852.58s]  Oh, it's resting.
[21852.58s -> 21854.02s]  Oh, it's because I'm resting.
[21854.02s -> 21854.50s]  It's fine.
[21854.50s -> 21854.74s]  I'm fine.
[21854.74s -> 21855.30s]  It doesn't hurt.
[21855.30s -> 21856.02s]  It's fine.
[21856.02s -> 21857.54s]  It's a rash.
[21858.18s -> 21861.14s]  It's from sitting leaning for an entire episode of this game.
[21861.70s -> 21868.10s]  I'm all right.
[21868.10s -> 21869.94s]  I'm scared to go to the top right.
[21869.94s -> 21871.22s]  Because oh, because you can't see.
[21871.94s -> 21872.98s]  There's a $34,000 right here.
[21875.32s -> 21875.96s]  That's scary.
[21878.74s -> 21879.86s]  I think I'm going to go right here.
[21880.50s -> 21884.30s]  Everyone wants the top shit.
[21884.30s -> 21884.78s]  That's fine.
[21885.42s -> 21886.30s]  I'll be fine with $60,000.
[21886.30s -> 21886.78s]  I'm way ahead.
[21891.85s -> 21893.21s]  Uh, herd size.
[21893.21s -> 21894.17s]  40 horses?
[21894.17s -> 21900.33s]  I don't think I need that.
[21900.33s -> 21901.45s]  Oh, yes.
[21901.45s -> 21902.09s]  Right Inc.
[21902.09s -> 21903.21s]  98 cents.
[21903.21s -> 21904.09s]  Can't go below it.
[21904.09s -> 21904.49s]  Perfect.
[21905.21s -> 21907.70s]  All right.
[21907.70s -> 21908.50s]  $64,000.
[21909.38s -> 21910.58s]  This is for 6%.
[21910.58s -> 21911.30s]  I got to buy this.
[21914.23s -> 21914.87s]  All right.
[21914.87s -> 21915.19s]  6%.
[21916.15s -> 21924.34s]  I'm going to pull the trigger right now.
[21924.90s -> 21927.61s]  I need, I'm going to do it.
[21927.61s -> 21928.74s]  I'm at 31.
[21928.74s -> 21929.78s]  I have tons of money.
[21930.34s -> 21931.61s]  I'm at 31%.
[21934.26s -> 21936.98s]  I cannot risk, um, anybody else getting that.
[21936.98s -> 21939.06s]  Especially you because that you'd be at 16.
[21939.94s -> 21945.37s]  All right.
[21945.37s -> 21945.93s]  I'm good now.
[21946.49s -> 21949.61s]  You look tired.
[21950.17s -> 21951.45s]  Um, I would.
[21951.45s -> 21953.37s]  I mean, I'm a little, a little drained.
[21953.37s -> 21953.93s]  I'm fine though.
[21954.81s -> 21957.05s]  I wouldn't say I'm tired.
[21957.69s -> 21959.66s]  Okay.
[21959.66s -> 21962.46s]  Let's make sure I don't blow this, uh, right side.
[21967.99s -> 21968.47s]  Not great.
[21969.11s -> 21969.75s]  Not great.
[21969.75s -> 21970.55s]  Let's get some moles.
[21971.27s -> 21980.84s]  Okay.
[21980.84s -> 21981.64s]  We're going to go right.
[21981.64s -> 21982.52s]  There's a lot in the middle.
[21983.08s -> 21984.20s]  All right.
[21984.20s -> 21986.52s]  We're going to go right here and I'm going to go.
[21987.48s -> 21987.88s]  Wham.
[21987.88s -> 21988.20s]  Wham.
[21988.20s -> 21988.52s]  Wham.
[21989.16s -> 22003.43s]  Start getting some cash, please.
[22014.97s -> 22018.70s]  Come on.
[22018.70s -> 22019.58s]  I'm on.
[22019.58s -> 22033.90s]  Okay.
[22033.90s -> 22034.38s]  That's good.
[22034.38s -> 22035.02s]  Let's upgrade.
[22036.26s -> 22037.06s]  Ready?
[22037.06s -> 22037.86s]  Get another horse.
[22038.42s -> 22039.14s]  Staying on the right side.
[22039.14s -> 22047.80s]  I'm not, I don't care about left.
[22047.80s -> 22049.72s]  It's going to start to get funky here.
[22049.72s -> 22082.57s]  Look at that money rolling in and what I want to see.
[22082.57s -> 22091.88s]  It's all upgraded all the way.
[22091.88s -> 22092.28s]  All right.
[22092.28s -> 22095.06s]  Now let's do scan over here.
[22095.06s -> 22102.73s]  Look at the gas now.
[22102.73s -> 22103.21s]  Wow.
[22103.21s -> 22103.69s]  All right.
[22103.69s -> 22104.65s]  Holy shit.
[22104.65s -> 22147.10s]  Time for the big money.
[22147.10s -> 22150.33s]  Time to begin storing.
[22150.33s -> 22153.61s]  All right.
[22153.61s -> 22154.49s]  We're in August.
[22154.49s -> 22155.75s]  Fill those tanks.
[22155.75s -> 22171.08s]  September.
[22171.08s -> 22175.70s]  Fill them up.
[22175.70s -> 22176.34s]  All right.
[22176.34s -> 22178.71s]  Do I even do the gas?
[22178.71s -> 22180.66s]  There's only one gas here.
[22180.66s -> 22189.99s]  Is it really only one gas?
[22189.99s -> 22199.70s]  It's all right.
[22199.70s -> 22206.28s]  It might be one here.
[22206.28s -> 22206.92s]  Shit.
[22206.92s -> 22207.48s]  Wait.
[22207.48s -> 22216.55s]  Son of a gun.
[22216.55s -> 22217.72s]  Son of a gun.
[22217.72s -> 22224.82s]  Who needs the gas?
[22224.82s -> 22238.42s]  All right.
[22238.42s -> 22239.22s]  Let's go.
[22239.22s -> 22240.94s]  I have a gas.
[22255.21s -> 22256.65s]  Still on the left side.
[22256.65s -> 22258.31s]  Left side.
[22258.31s -> 22259.11s]  Go to left side.
[22259.11s -> 22263.24s]  All of you change it.
[22264.28s -> 22265.00s]  Right side.
[22265.72s -> 22266.68s]  Right side.
[22266.68s -> 22280.97s]  We're good.
[22280.97s -> 22281.93s]  40,000.
[22281.93s -> 22282.49s]  I got everything.
[22282.49s -> 22283.21s]  I'll get the bonuses.
[22283.21s -> 22283.77s]  All of it.
[22283.77s -> 22284.49s]  3k.
[22284.49s -> 22291.96s]  At least you still got it all sold.
[22291.96s -> 22292.68s]  Yeah.
[22292.68s -> 22295.88s]  This is in the bag by the way.
[22295.88s -> 22296.36s]  There's no way.
[22296.36s -> 22297.72s]  I don't think I can lose.
[22297.72s -> 22300.97s]  This is too weird for me.
[22300.97s -> 22302.57s]  I don't think I even want it.
[22302.57s -> 22322.54s]  Do the super gas.
[22322.54s -> 22325.75s]  Thermal could be mega OP.
[22325.75s -> 22326.79s]  I'll try it.
[22326.79s -> 22327.27s]  I'll try it.
[22327.75s -> 22329.75s]  I want to make sure I have enough money to not care.
[22330.39s -> 22331.27s]  I have 80,000.
[22331.27s -> 22332.87s]  I want to make sure I'm not going to buy anything.
[22335.43s -> 22336.07s]  60k.
[22343.91s -> 22344.39s]  That's...
[22344.39s -> 22344.71s]  No.
[22345.27s -> 22345.99s]  That's too much.
[22347.43s -> 22348.15s]  That's too much.
[22354.07s -> 22355.67s]  84 on the right side.
[22359.21s -> 22359.45s]  Sure.
[22364.39s -> 22366.63s]  I'll do speed three though.
[22366.63s -> 22368.55s]  Because the drill can go so fast I think.
[22371.80s -> 22372.68s]  Six percent.
[22372.68s -> 22373.18s]  Uh-oh.
[22377.78s -> 22379.86s]  You're not going to spend literally your entire net worth on this.
[22381.06s -> 22381.70s]  But you might.
[22383.48s -> 22392.23s]  I'm almost there.
[22392.23s -> 22392.73s]  Elbow.
[22394.86s -> 22397.42s]  I'm telling you it's also because the camera is set up a certain way.
[22403.03s -> 22404.63s]  Stop playing fart simulator.
[22416.36s -> 22418.92s]  Are you really saying this is a fart simulator game?
[22418.92s -> 22432.91s]  Start.
[22436.25s -> 22441.78s]  Good start Andy.
[22441.78s -> 22442.66s]  There's gas down here.
[22451.37s -> 22452.33s]  I'm begging you.
[22452.33s -> 22453.29s]  I don't know what you're begging me.
[22455.29s -> 22477.14s]  All right.
[22477.14s -> 22478.58s]  This is super drill now.
[22478.58s -> 22482.28s]  So now I'm going to only...
[22482.28s -> 22483.32s]  I'm going to use this thing, right?
[22484.12s -> 22484.84s]  Let's go over here.
[22490.44s -> 22491.16s]  I think that's gas.
[22498.65s -> 22499.53s]  Very nice.
[22499.53s -> 22500.17s]  Very nice.
[22520.14s -> 22522.78s]  Is it efficient if I put one of these things here and connect it?
[22522.78s -> 22524.14s]  Or is there any reason to do that?
[22525.45s -> 22528.17s]  Should I put one like another one and connect it here?
[22528.17s -> 22529.13s]  Would it pump faster?
[22529.85s -> 22530.35s]  Or no?
[22534.79s -> 22535.29s]  No.
[22535.75s -> 22536.25s]  Yes.
[22537.03s -> 22537.53s]  Left.
[22537.53s -> 22538.87s]  No, I don't care about left.
[22538.87s -> 22539.91s]  No, we're good.
[22539.91s -> 22540.41s]  We're good.
[22540.79s -> 22554.39s]  120.
[22554.39s -> 22554.63s]  I don't know.
[22554.63s -> 22555.13s]  I don't care.
[22606.28s -> 22607.24s]  Oh yeah.
[22608.49s -> 22609.90s]  So it's August.
[22609.90s -> 22629.29s]  We're good.
[22629.29s -> 22629.79s]  What?
[22629.79s -> 22643.99s]  Let's go this way.
[22643.99s -> 22644.39s]  All right.
[22644.39s -> 22645.11s]  Let's go.
[22645.11s -> 22648.97s]  Why is he sweating so much?
[22649.85s -> 22652.33s]  I've been obviously in the same chair for 12 hours, dude.
[22653.35s -> 22653.67s]  I'm not...
[22653.67s -> 22654.87s]  No, my hair just went down.
[22654.87s -> 22655.37s]  You're fine.
[22656.57s -> 22657.07s]  I'm fine.
[22657.61s -> 22659.67s]  You're going to be fine.
[22659.67s -> 22666.04s]  November.
[22670.20s -> 22672.28s]  I'm not going to fill that.
[22672.28s -> 22673.93s]  That's not going to happen.
[22676.44s -> 22677.80s]  Bottleneck Billy.
[22680.50s -> 22681.54s]  I just need to...
[22681.54s -> 22681.86s]  Whatever.
[22681.86s -> 22682.50s]  Where's the gas?
[22683.30s -> 22684.74s]  Bottleneck Billy.
[22685.46s -> 22701.14s]  I made it with 17k.
[22701.78s -> 22704.07s]  Okay.
[22704.07s -> 22705.83s]  So that's not efficient.
[22705.83s -> 22706.39s]  It's fine.
[22706.39s -> 22706.89s]  I got money.
[22708.68s -> 22709.18s]  Uh-oh.
[22727.86s -> 22728.58s]  8k for this?
[22729.61s -> 22730.25s]  God, dude.
[22730.25s -> 22730.75s]  10k?
[22746.76s -> 22747.32s]  She's smart.
[22747.32s -> 22747.96s]  I'm going up here.
[22747.96s -> 22753.50s]  This is going to be like probably 50.
[22753.50s -> 22755.61s]  All right.
[22755.61s -> 22756.81s]  I have to make sure I...
[22757.37s -> 22758.46s]  This is for 4%.
[22759.18s -> 22759.68s]  Okay.
[22760.62s -> 22761.02s]  Spend...
[22761.02s -> 22761.42s]  Do it now.
[22761.42s -> 22762.14s]  Spend all your money.
[22762.78s -> 22766.73s]  You can afford it.
[22766.73s -> 22767.23s]  Buy it right now.
[22767.85s -> 22771.29s]  You can afford it.
[22771.29s -> 22771.79s]  Buy it.
[22776.94s -> 22777.44s]  Yeah, good.
[22778.30s -> 22778.80s]  $27,000.
[22779.98s -> 22781.10s]  I have 37%.
[22781.10s -> 22783.02s]  You'll never match my share count.
[22783.02s -> 22787.47s]  That's fine.
[22788.01s -> 22794.87s]  By the way, don't ever forget who vetoed the diet soda machine.
[22796.25s -> 22796.75s]  This guy.
[22797.37s -> 22801.45s]  Oh, you voted for that?
[22802.01s -> 22803.21s]  Yeah, we're going to have a diet soda machine.
[22803.21s -> 22803.77s]  We're going to have diet...
[22803.77s -> 22804.27s]  No.
[22804.27s -> 22806.41s]  I put my 3,700,000 shares.
[22807.29s -> 22808.57s]  I vetoed that.
[22809.29s -> 22811.10s]  12-hour Andy?
[22811.10s -> 22811.60s]  Yep.
[22811.98s -> 22832.60s]  What am I with?
[22832.60s -> 22833.10s]  All right.
[22833.56s -> 22835.43s]  I see gas right there.
[22836.07s -> 22839.00s]  Give me a loan.
[22839.72s -> 22840.44s]  I'll pay it back.
[22840.44s -> 22841.88s]  It's so easy to pay back.
[22842.68s -> 22854.23s]  All right.
[22854.23s -> 22855.67s]  I'm not going to be a bottleneck Barry.
[22891.38s -> 22891.88s]  Shut up.
[22892.34s -> 22892.84s]  Pow.
[22893.38s -> 22910.71s]  Okay.
[22910.71s -> 22911.91s]  Fill up that silo.
[22911.91s -> 22912.41s]  Now.
[22912.41s -> 22914.39s]  Canning.
[22914.39s -> 22940.20s]  Oh, there's no more.
[22940.20s -> 23001.74s]  Start filling it up.
[23001.74s -> 23012.50s]  Nothing.
[23012.50s -> 23013.00s]  Really?
[23014.84s -> 23016.44s]  This ones suck.
[23016.44s -> 23019.70s]  Not even worth getting that fucking gas.
[23019.70s -> 23020.10s]  Look at that.
[23020.10s -> 23021.06s]  Not even worth it.
[23021.06s -> 23021.94s]  I'm just going to sell, man.
[23021.94s -> 23022.90s]  It's not worth it.
[23025.75s -> 23026.47s]  There's nothing else.
[23027.11s -> 23032.89s]  Unless there's something right here.
[23033.53s -> 23035.06s]  Then I got to start selling.
[23035.70s -> 23038.01s]  What a terrible map.
[23038.57s -> 23039.07s]  What?
[23039.53s -> 23042.26s]  All right.
[23042.26s -> 23046.50s]  Just store until I get a good return potential here.
[23046.50s -> 23047.62s]  Left side looking pretty good.
[23048.34s -> 23050.55s]  Everybody go.
[23050.55s -> 23051.05s]  Left side.
[23057.06s -> 23057.70s]  Good.
[23057.70s -> 23058.66s]  Very good.
[23058.66s -> 23059.62s]  Very good.
[23059.62s -> 23060.02s]  Very good.
[23060.02s -> 23061.22s]  And I'm going to end early.
[23064.87s -> 23065.83s]  Look at how shitty this was.
[23066.39s -> 23076.25s]  Falling off.
[23076.25s -> 23079.58s]  The race for the majority of the stocks is getting exciting.
[23079.58s -> 23083.66s]  Remember that the first person with 50 plus percent becomes the new mayor.
[23089.85s -> 23090.81s]  Show me where a good one is.
[23096.47s -> 23096.71s]  Yeah.
[23096.71s -> 23097.27s]  No shit.
[23097.27s -> 23098.07s]  It's going to be that one.
[23098.71s -> 23100.15s]  Why did I give this guy a diamond?
[23100.63s -> 23106.44s]  Who has the most money?
[23106.44s -> 23112.78s]  Somebody outbid me on that.
[23113.50s -> 23114.90s]  Somebody outbid me on that.
[23115.54s -> 23116.10s]  Oh my god.
[23116.10s -> 23116.82s]  You idiot.
[23117.78s -> 23118.74s]  $12,000.
[23119.78s -> 23121.14s]  I'm just going to go steal this from you.
[23128.92s -> 23129.32s]  I think.
[23129.88s -> 23130.36s]  Who?
[23130.36s -> 23131.64s]  Everyone's snoozing on the left side.
[23131.64s -> 23133.00s]  57, 65, 59.
[23133.00s -> 23133.48s]  You kidding me?
[23133.96s -> 23138.18s]  I just screwed you.
[23138.18s -> 23139.46s]  You just got screwed.
[23139.46s -> 23140.81s]  Let's go.
[23142.52s -> 23142.84s]  8%.
[23144.04s -> 23146.81s]  I got to lock it in.
[23147.45s -> 23148.41s]  I got to lock it in right now.
[23149.05s -> 23150.25s]  I'm going to lock it in right now.
[23150.25s -> 23151.37s]  One, two, three.
[23151.37s -> 23152.25s]  I'm going to lock it in right now.
[23156.25s -> 23156.89s]  45%.
[23159.19s -> 23161.03s]  I'm almost the mayor of the city.
[23161.03s -> 23162.55s]  It's going to be close.
[23163.11s -> 23168.65s]  And this is probably a really good spot.
[23169.53s -> 23169.93s]  Let's go.
[23172.50s -> 23173.86s]  Five more percent and I win.
[23173.86s -> 23187.11s]  That's bad.
[23187.11s -> 23189.13s]  It's actually really terrible.
[23189.69s -> 23190.92s]  I'm going to take a loan out.
[23191.56s -> 23201.16s]  Okay.
[23201.16s -> 23201.72s]  This is not bad.
[23201.72s -> 23203.24s]  Let's get some gophers.
[23203.24s -> 23211.29s]  It's all in the middle.
[23211.85s -> 23212.97s]  We're going to stay on the left side.
[23212.97s -> 23213.77s]  All it's all in the middle.
[23213.77s -> 23214.49s]  It's all right here.
[23214.49s -> 23241.64s]  Go somewhere with it.
[23242.97s -> 23244.49s]  I just sounded so angry.
[23244.49s -> 23284.65s]  We're going straight down from here.
[23286.68s -> 23287.56s]  How do I cancel that?
[23287.56s -> 23290.52s]  Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.
[23290.52s -> 23309.75s]  It's not serious.
[23309.75s -> 23311.03s]  It is because I don't want to lose the game.
[23311.03s -> 23372.15s]  I'm about to beat the game.
[23372.15s -> 23373.27s]  Bottleneck Billy.
[23373.27s -> 23375.13s]  This isn't it's not that bad, is it?
[23375.13s -> 23413.72s]  Fill it up.
[23413.72s -> 23457.27s]  It's already gone.
[23457.83s -> 23459.10s]  It's already worse.
[23477.64s -> 23478.84s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[23478.84s -> 23480.68s]  I didn't I didn't even pay attention.
[23480.68s -> 23484.89s]  I think that's it.
[23484.89s -> 23486.01s]  I think all the resources are gone.
[23486.01s -> 23486.89s]  I have to drain this.
[23486.89s -> 23494.14s]  Drain it, drain it, drain it already.
[23494.14s -> 23494.54s]  All right.
[23494.54s -> 23498.54s]  Are we at zero?
[23498.54s -> 23499.82s]  All the resources are gone, right?
[23500.38s -> 23502.22s]  Oh, fuck you.
[23541.59s -> 23542.87s]  He told me about that spot.
[23542.87s -> 23544.07s]  It's my secret place.
[23562.12s -> 23563.16s]  I win the game if I do this.
[23563.72s -> 23579.94s]  I have to make some money.
[23579.94s -> 23583.93s]  Could I have just taken out a loan of like 50 grand
[23583.93s -> 23585.05s]  and just been the mayor?
[23589.21s -> 23589.85s]  Oh, shit.
[23589.85s -> 23590.81s]  This is really bad.
[23590.81s -> 23591.53s]  All right.
[23591.53s -> 23596.78s]  This better hopefully chat was right.
[23596.78s -> 23599.26s]  I'm not going to blow like two grand with the scanner.
[23603.90s -> 23606.14s]  Seems pretty promising so far right in the middle here.
[23620.82s -> 23622.34s]  Seems pretty promising right off the bat.
[23622.82s -> 23623.46s]  Two big ones.
[23624.86s -> 23625.90s]  And a gas right there.
[23667.27s -> 23668.39s]  Don't overflow.
[23668.39s -> 23669.43s]  Not on me now.
[23669.43s -> 23687.96s]  Store.
[23687.96s -> 23699.32s]  I'll take the diamond.
[23699.32s -> 23699.56s]  All right.
[23699.56s -> 23700.36s]  This is all right.
[23700.36s -> 23701.80s]  I'm just going to go down from here.
[23701.80s -> 23705.35s]  Keep this one running.
[23705.35s -> 23721.85s]  A whole lot of nothing.
[23721.85s -> 23727.85s]  I need some money.
[23727.85s -> 23737.37s]  All right.
[23737.37s -> 23738.01s]  11 grand.
[23739.32s -> 23741.00s]  Actually, everyone keeps selling
[23741.00s -> 23756.57s]  because I need I need the cash bad.
[23756.57s -> 23758.01s]  Place is dry, guys.
[23760.54s -> 23764.62s]  Place is dry, man.
[23764.62s -> 23777.42s]  Place is dry.
[23777.42s -> 23779.06s]  Guys, place is dry.
[23779.06s -> 23779.62s]  Right, right.
[23779.62s -> 23780.34s]  What do you mean right?
[23780.34s -> 23781.62s]  This place is dry, man.
[23781.62s -> 23786.49s]  There ain't nothing here.
[23787.69s -> 23788.33s]  Sell right.
[23789.94s -> 23790.82s]  There's nothing else to sell.
[23791.62s -> 23793.75s]  There's nothing else.
[23793.75s -> 23794.39s]  Sell right.
[23795.67s -> 23797.03s]  The oil is gone.
[23811.69s -> 23827.45s]  This place was junk.
[23827.45s -> 23828.33s]  I got 40k.
[23830.54s -> 23831.34s]  All right.
[23831.34s -> 23833.98s]  I am in a position to get that.
[23833.98s -> 23834.46s]  Hold on.
[23839.48s -> 23841.16s]  71 cents on left side.
[23841.16s -> 23841.96s]  Not enough.
[23841.96s -> 23843.72s]  80 cents on right side.
[23846.01s -> 23846.25s]  No.
[23851.74s -> 23852.86s]  This is really okay.
[23853.42s -> 23854.38s]  They're going to think I'm stupid.
[23854.94s -> 23865.70s]  That's fine.
[23865.70s -> 23868.52s]  I got 34k.
[23870.18s -> 23870.82s]  Four percent.
[23888.44s -> 23889.00s]  All right.
[23889.00s -> 23889.64s]  I fucked up.
[23892.79s -> 23894.07s]  I clicked a little too late.
[23906.10s -> 23909.88s]  The Patriots just got like three safeties in a row.
[23909.88s -> 23910.92s]  That was that reaction.
[23913.10s -> 23917.10s]  Like Tom Brady fumbled the ball 15 times in the first quarter.
[23917.66s -> 23919.34s]  That's like what that is.
[23919.34s -> 23920.22s]  That's what I just did.
[23923.35s -> 23923.75s]  All right.
[23925.29s -> 23926.57s]  No scanning.
[23926.57s -> 23927.53s]  No scanning.
[23927.53s -> 23928.25s]  This is apparent.
[23928.25s -> 23929.37s]  This might be a good one.
[23930.01s -> 23932.65s]  We're doing gophers.
[23932.65s -> 23941.34s]  It's going to be the big one.
[23941.34s -> 23942.54s]  I see gas over here.
[23943.10s -> 23945.90s]  I'll take a loan.
[23945.90s -> 23946.62s]  I don't fucking care.
[23947.18s -> 23947.42s]  No.
[23958.14s -> 23959.42s]  I don't want to go in there yet.
[23959.42s -> 23960.30s]  I don't know.
[23960.30s -> 23965.53s]  Okay.
[23965.53s -> 23966.49s]  So of course.
[23972.17s -> 23973.13s]  This one sucks.
[23973.13s -> 23973.77s]  I know it does.
[23987.77s -> 23988.81s]  This one sucks.
[23988.81s -> 23991.14s]  This is going to be two or three little dumps.
[23991.78s -> 23992.26s]  And that's it.
[23992.82s -> 24016.04s]  Start storing.
[24016.04s -> 24016.92s]  All right.
[24016.92s -> 24018.36s]  I need to make a move here.
[24018.36s -> 24019.48s]  Scan.
[24019.48s -> 24022.33s]  Is there anything down here that I can get over here?
[24026.52s -> 24027.24s]  Oh my god.
[24027.24s -> 24029.56s]  They look at all this gas but this place sucks.
[24029.56s -> 24040.76s]  It's already June.
[24040.76s -> 24041.56s]  I don't have shit.
[24043.29s -> 24044.89s]  There's three gases though.
[24044.89s -> 24056.58s]  This place is ass.
[24056.58s -> 24091.32s]  This place is ass.
[24091.32s -> 24104.07s]  This store.
[24104.07s -> 24106.20s]  There's no reason to do this right now.
[24106.20s -> 24108.04s]  Just store and wait for the big thing at the end.
[24108.04s -> 24118.76s]  This place is absolute ass.
[24118.76s -> 24120.04s]  Fill up this silo.
[24120.04s -> 24146.44s]  Look at how terrible this is.
[24146.44s -> 24149.11s]  I bet you this is 15.
[24149.11s -> 24149.99s]  It's probably 10.
[24152.22s -> 24153.98s]  This shit's probably five.
[24153.98s -> 24156.22s]  It's going to be the lowest of the whole game.
[24156.22s -> 24158.86s]  I should have just bid another five grand
[24158.86s -> 24159.74s]  and taken it from that guy.
[24159.74s -> 24160.62s]  That might have lost me the game.
[24162.65s -> 24163.69s]  I may have just lost me the whole game.
[24164.82s -> 24165.70s]  All right.
[24165.70s -> 24166.50s]  Let's go.
[24166.50s -> 24167.46s]  Here we go.
[24167.46s -> 24167.94s]  This way.
[24168.74s -> 24174.50s]  It's time to open up the gas.
[24196.09s -> 24199.38s]  What are you talking about?
[24199.38s -> 24210.47s]  It's 21.
[24210.47s -> 24221.56s]  It's still bad.
[24221.56s -> 24223.08s]  I have to win this auction.
[24223.08s -> 24223.72s]  Whatever it is.
[24224.44s -> 24230.18s]  I need five percent.
[24232.87s -> 24233.67s]  Okay.
[24233.67s -> 24238.07s]  I'm just kidding.
[24238.07s -> 24238.79s]  I won the game.
[24238.79s -> 24239.35s]  I won the game.
[24239.35s -> 24240.23s]  I just won the game.
[24240.23s -> 24242.41s]  I'm at 50 percent.
[24242.41s -> 24243.29s]  I own the company.
[24243.29s -> 24244.17s]  I own the company.
[24244.17s -> 24245.13s]  You're fired.
[24245.13s -> 24246.09s]  You're fired.
[24246.09s -> 24247.05s]  You're fired.
[24247.05s -> 24248.09s]  You're all fired.
[24248.09s -> 24250.49s]  And by the way, I'm taking a vacation.
[24251.75s -> 24252.15s]  I win.
[24254.23s -> 24254.95s]  It's 51.
[24255.67s -> 24257.96s]  No, it's not.
[24261.80s -> 24262.60s]  He said 50.
[24263.16s -> 24271.19s]  What are you talking about?
[24271.19s -> 24280.25s]  It's gonna be a good one.
[24280.25s -> 24281.53s]  Oh, yeah.
[24283.67s -> 24284.39s]  Oh, yeah.
[24284.39s -> 24285.35s]  This is a big one.
[24285.35s -> 24306.15s]  Let's go double here.
[24306.15s -> 24307.35s]  Oh, shit.
[24307.35s -> 24349.16s]  This is gonna be the big one.
[24349.16s -> 24349.72s]  I know it.
[24349.72s -> 24354.09s]  There's two huge veins right here.
[24354.09s -> 24354.65s]  Left.
[24354.65s -> 24363.83s]  I see like, I just have a meteor just hit the earth.
[24363.83s -> 24364.95s]  There's nothing even over here.
[24366.39s -> 24366.79s]  Really?
[24368.87s -> 24370.23s]  What the fuck?
[24370.23s -> 24398.58s]  Nothing.
[24398.58s -> 24402.74s]  I think this actually might be it.
[24402.74s -> 24415.51s]  Oh, there's a little one down there.
[24415.51s -> 24417.03s]  Dude, it's empty.
[24417.03s -> 24420.20s]  Forget about the gas.
[24421.40s -> 24438.52s]  I just need over like 30k or 20k and I win the game.
[24438.52s -> 24439.48s]  Yeah, this is it, man.
[24439.48s -> 24440.28s]  That's it.
[24440.28s -> 24444.76s]  30k.
[24444.76s -> 24445.64s]  I'll take it.
[24445.64s -> 24453.77s]  Unless there's something over here.
[24453.77s -> 24454.41s]  No, no way.
[24455.05s -> 24460.41s]  30k is enough for me.
[24460.41s -> 24461.29s]  That's fine.
[24461.29s -> 24464.50s]  Let's just check.
[24464.50s -> 24465.30s]  It's only August.
[24465.94s -> 24475.16s]  I don't think so.
[24479.50s -> 24480.46s]  No, that's it.
[24480.46s -> 24480.94s]  I'm out.
[24484.12s -> 24484.60s]  Yeah.
[24484.60s -> 24486.04s]  This is diamond right there.
[24486.04s -> 24486.36s]  All right.
[24486.36s -> 24488.41s]  25,000.
[24488.41s -> 24490.25s]  That puts me at 28k.
[24490.97s -> 24495.06s]  Do I not own the company yet?
[24495.62s -> 24500.74s]  I only have two more rounds left.
[24500.74s -> 24501.70s]  I don't own the company?
[24502.34s -> 24536.55s]  What were you doing all game?
[24538.42s -> 24539.14s]  All right.
[24539.14s -> 24540.74s]  I'm just going to try to bank money.
[24540.74s -> 24541.70s]  I'm going to try to bank money.
[24542.71s -> 24544.39s]  That's all that matters right at this very moment.
[24545.19s -> 24547.94s]  Only two rounds.
[24579.98s -> 24596.70s]  Diamond.
[24596.70s -> 24597.18s]  Hurry up.
[24597.18s -> 24625.03s]  Get some selling.
[24625.03s -> 24625.67s]  All right.
[24625.67s -> 24636.50s]  Store.
[24636.50s -> 24637.54s]  Sell on the right side.
[24637.54s -> 24642.87s]  I need a little bit of cash.
[24642.87s -> 24644.23s]  Actually sell everything over there.
[24644.23s -> 24645.03s]  Sell everything.
[24645.03s -> 24649.74s]  Got a buck.
[24649.74s -> 24655.46s]  Sell everything.
[24655.46s -> 24656.02s]  Okay.
[24656.02s -> 24656.66s]  Hold off.
[24656.66s -> 24658.94s]  I'm going to do double super silo over here.
[24667.80s -> 24677.30s]  Junk.
[24677.30s -> 24677.86s]  Is it worth it?
[24678.82s -> 24679.78s]  Don't tell me that wasn't worth it.
[24681.54s -> 24682.18s]  Was.
[24682.18s -> 24683.30s]  I think it's empty now.
[24683.30s -> 24711.34s]  Let's check.
[24711.34s -> 24716.79s]  I have 32 grand.
[24716.79s -> 24717.83s]  This is the final round.
[24717.83s -> 24718.63s]  This is it.
[24718.63s -> 24719.83s]  I have to win this auction.
[24725.75s -> 24726.39s]  All right.
[24726.39s -> 24727.90s]  I have to win this auction.
[24727.90s -> 24741.99s]  She's going to buy it.
[24741.99s -> 24743.91s]  Oh my god Blanche.
[24743.91s -> 24749.77s]  Blanche.
[24749.77s -> 24750.97s]  You're out of the game already.
[24752.23s -> 24753.03s]  Don't do that.
[24753.75s -> 24758.42s]  You're out of the game already.
[24758.42s -> 24759.30s]  You don't land.
[24759.30s -> 24760.10s]  Okay.
[24760.10s -> 24761.75s]  I'm sorry.
[24761.75s -> 24765.88s]  But like you landed on like park place in Monopoly.
[24765.88s -> 24768.28s]  You have two random ass properties.
[24768.84s -> 24769.72s]  I have boardwalk.
[24770.84s -> 24773.37s]  And I also own monopolies.
[24773.37s -> 24775.93s]  I own three monopolies.
[24775.93s -> 24776.81s]  The other person over here.
[24776.81s -> 24777.61s]  My friend over here.
[24778.17s -> 24779.85s]  Has three monopolies.
[24779.85s -> 24781.93s]  And you just took park place.
[24782.73s -> 24784.17s]  And you just won't concede the game.
[24784.17s -> 24785.69s]  And now you just like ruined it for me.
[24786.63s -> 24787.51s]  I just got blocked.
[24787.51s -> 24787.99s]  Yeah.
[24787.99s -> 24789.51s]  It's I hate that.
[24789.51s -> 24794.68s]  It's like the three of us playing.
[24796.41s -> 24799.77s]  You have like 30 bucks after buying park place.
[24800.41s -> 24818.98s]  Now don't throw.
[24818.98s -> 24820.42s]  I can probably still win.
[24820.42s -> 24822.82s]  There's probably one more auction.
[24822.82s -> 24831.10s]  Drink some water dude.
[24831.10s -> 24834.86s]  I drank like 150 ounces of water over the last 12 hours.
[24836.54s -> 24836.86s]  All right.
[24836.86s -> 24837.82s]  This is dog shit.
[24837.82s -> 24839.18s]  It's absolutely terrible.
[24841.11s -> 24843.43s]  But I just I got to make a little bit of cash.
[24852.60s -> 24853.32s]  It's so bad.
[24875.26s -> 24877.02s]  I'm just trying to make some at least a little bit of money.
[24877.82s -> 24878.94s]  Check far right for oil.
[24879.58s -> 24893.96s]  I think so.
[24893.96s -> 24895.00s]  There is gas over here.
[24895.00s -> 24895.88s]  But I don't think I can.
[24895.88s -> 24896.92s]  I'm not going to be able to get enough.
[24896.92s -> 24897.32s]  I don't think.
[24898.04s -> 24943.32s]  I just figured out that you can go like this with the mouse scroll.
[24943.32s -> 24943.88s]  I've been like.
[24951.06s -> 24951.86s]  That might be.
[24951.86s -> 24953.14s]  Actually, I don't care.
[25048.44s -> 25063.42s]  Yes, 10 grand and I get the bonuses.
[25063.42s -> 25063.98s]  Very nice.
[25063.98s -> 25064.38s]  All right.
[25064.38s -> 25064.94s]  11 grand.
[25064.94s -> 25067.19s]  What does that put me at?
[25067.19s -> 25068.07s]  41.
[25068.07s -> 25074.66s]  What happened to um what happened to Blanche?
[25076.23s -> 25078.15s]  Oh yeah right.
[25078.15s -> 25088.04s]  Blanche you you bought park place and then you two or three turns later got up to go
[25088.04s -> 25094.34s]  to the bathroom and get a drink and then started talking to somebody in the hallway
[25094.34s -> 25096.18s]  at whatever family get together or at.
[25097.67s -> 25104.54s]  And you never come back and sit down at the table and then you sit on the couch
[25104.54s -> 25111.53s]  and the TV is on and then we just kind of say let's stop playing.
[25111.53s -> 25113.96s]  I guess it's over.
[25114.60s -> 25115.56s]  The game's over.
[25115.56s -> 25120.66s]  It's a tie plus two farming you know.
[25121.38s -> 25121.78s]  All right.
[25121.78s -> 25122.90s]  So do I win?
[25125.40s -> 25126.44s]  That was it folks.
[25126.44s -> 25127.16s]  I'm out of land.
[25127.16s -> 25129.32s]  Now let's see who would become the new mayor.
[25129.32s -> 25130.60s]  Did I actually not do it?
[25131.24s -> 25135.72s]  There is no winner yet.
[25135.72s -> 25139.48s]  This means the stockholder with the smallest share and the least money
[25140.54s -> 25142.14s]  in case of a draw will have to go.
[25142.78s -> 25148.14s]  But Blanche will have to pack up and leave and we will auction off their 11 percent shares.
[25149.69s -> 25158.54s]  Meet me at the stock auction to decide who gets the remaining 11 percent of the stock.
[25158.54s -> 25161.10s]  Oh I thought I was trying to take out like a hundred thousand dollar loan.
[25163.80s -> 25164.12s]  Hey.
[25164.76s -> 25169.32s]  Oh do you want it?
[25169.32s -> 25171.24s]  Hey hey oh hey Ricardo you want it?
[25171.24s -> 25172.28s]  Hey Ricardo you want it?
[25173.00s -> 25173.40s]  All right.
[25173.40s -> 25176.36s]  I'm gonna I'll get Ricardo do you want you wanted some shares?
[25176.36s -> 25181.96s]  I'm the mayor.
[25181.96s -> 25184.92s]  Great job you've secured more than half of the town's shares.
[25186.50s -> 25189.70s]  You've won the campaign and you'll be the new mayor.
[25189.70s -> 25191.38s]  I've got something special for you as a reward.
[25191.38s -> 25192.42s]  Meet me at the town hall.
[25193.22s -> 25200.02s]  What do you mean land auction?
[25200.02s -> 25200.50s]  What is this?
[25201.30s -> 25202.82s]  I have a special present for you.
[25203.54s -> 25207.62s]  See that island over there?
[25207.62s -> 25209.14s]  It's yours to mine.
[25209.78s -> 25215.34s]  We're done.
[25215.34s -> 25216.78s]  Let's go back outside.
[25219.78s -> 25221.14s]  Private island?
[25221.14s -> 25221.46s]  Mine?
[25223.88s -> 25224.36s]  Serious?
[25227.78s -> 25230.02s]  Are you ready for your final challenge?
[25230.74s -> 25336.10s]  Pilo.
[25372.30s -> 25452.97s]  Oh my god.
[25452.97s -> 25453.77s]  Hurry hurry.
[25500.90s -> 25512.46s]  Oh my god.
[25512.46s -> 25513.50s]  That's 100.
[25513.50s -> 25514.62s]  I'm gonna break the counter.
[25514.62s -> 25515.58s]  I can't count that high.
[25520.33s -> 25521.77s]  Dude I can't count this high.
[25535.61s -> 25536.57s]  I'm gonna break the counter.
[25537.21s -> 25537.93s]  What?
[25537.93s -> 25539.37s]  105?
[25539.37s -> 25540.81s]  Did I win?
[25541.53s -> 25542.17s]  Who cares?
[25548.55s -> 25549.11s]  110?
[25550.15s -> 25553.16s]  I made a hundred thousand.
[25553.88s -> 25554.60s]  He's tripping.
[25557.24s -> 25558.04s]  Congratulations.
[25558.04s -> 25558.68s]  You've won the game.
[25558.68s -> 25561.16s]  You can now play turmoil on expert mode.
[25561.16s -> 25564.04s]  Where the characters have special powers and the competition is tougher.
[25564.60s -> 25565.90s]  Give it a try.
[25565.90s -> 25566.38s]  Great job.
[25566.38s -> 25567.82s]  You've worked like a horse.
[25567.82s -> 25569.10s]  You get some horseshoes.
[25570.38s -> 25572.14s]  Me and the moles are very happy for you.
[25573.90s -> 25574.78s]  Party time.
[25574.78s -> 25577.62s]  I'm sure you'll buy everyone around.
[25577.62s -> 25578.26s]  Well done.
[25578.26s -> 25580.18s]  I'm sure you'll make almost as good a mayor as me.
[25580.82s -> 25585.29s]  My hat is off to you in your 24-carat oil mining performance.
[25585.29s -> 25588.42s]  Your performance was even stronger than my biceps.
[25589.38s -> 25590.74s]  I'm gonna miss our trips together.
[25591.70s -> 25594.02s]  Before you go, test your skills in expert mode.
[25594.02s -> 25597.94s]  Pay a final visit to my bank to check out the overall statistics of your campaign.
[25598.82s -> 25599.54s]  Oh, okay.
[25599.54s -> 25600.26s]  That's interesting.
[25600.82s -> 25602.23s]  Let's check it out.
[25606.87s -> 25613.62s]  Oh, not one million.
[25614.18s -> 25614.90s]  So close.
[25617.13s -> 25621.85s]  All these goddamn blockbuster late fees that screwed everything up.
[25621.85s -> 25622.73s]  I would have had over a million.
[25623.29s -> 25632.36s]  Sorry.
[25632.36s -> 25633.48s]  Graphs not available.
[25636.22s -> 25639.58s]  707,000 barrels sold.
[25640.95s -> 25642.47s]  761,000 earned.
[25643.46s -> 25645.38s]  Average price of $1.08 per barrel.
[25645.38s -> 25646.26s]  That's pretty good.
[25654.20s -> 25655.96s]  110 per barrel on the right.
[25658.31s -> 25659.59s]  I think this is pretty good.
[25659.59s -> 25660.47s]  That's actually pretty good.
[25661.35s -> 25662.07s]  Right side.
[25662.07s -> 25663.91s]  Oh, right Twix ended up winning.
[25666.89s -> 25667.29s]  I went.
[25667.29s -> 25668.01s]  That's funny.
[25668.01s -> 25668.97s]  Not by very much though.
[25669.91s -> 25670.31s]  What's the...
[25670.31s -> 25671.03s]  Oh, this is total.
[25678.30s -> 25680.30s]  You've streamed longer than the viewer count.
[25681.10s -> 25684.15s]  That's funny.
[25684.15s -> 25684.47s]  All right.
[25684.47s -> 25685.43s]  This is interesting.
[25687.21s -> 25688.33s]  Poor dowsers.
[25689.05s -> 25689.93s]  I didn't do...
[25689.93s -> 25690.41s]  I didn't...
[25690.41s -> 25694.09s]  Okay, after the tutorial zone, I didn't buy them ever again.
[25694.81s -> 25698.57s]  What was the thing I spent the most money on besides pipes?
[25700.98s -> 25701.78s]  Pipe upgrades?
[25701.78s -> 25702.10s]  Pipes?
[25702.10s -> 25707.21s]  I think I feel like I did that a little less ideal than I could have.
[25708.63s -> 25709.03s]  Rigs?
[25710.47s -> 25711.19s]  Valve usage?
[25711.75s -> 25712.71s]  Half of those were mistakes.
[25715.86s -> 25716.26s]  Moles?
[25716.26s -> 25717.06s]  I thought that would be more.
[25717.70s -> 25721.51s]  I spent more money on moles than silos.
[25721.51s -> 25726.36s]  That's kind of crazy.
[25726.36s -> 25727.96s]  I spam so many moles.
[25728.76s -> 25729.64s]  Screenshot.
[25731.93s -> 25735.69s]  Oh, cool.
[25736.33s -> 25740.23s]  What's the thing I spent the least on besides dowsers?
[25740.79s -> 25745.45s]  Tier 3 silo upgrade?
[25746.09s -> 25749.42s]  Valve usage?
[25750.46s -> 25750.94s]  Pretty good.
[25751.75s -> 25751.99s]  Cool.
[25753.66s -> 25754.22s]  Really cool.
[25754.22s -> 25754.86s]  That was awesome.
[25755.58s -> 25757.10s]  That was such a fun game.
[25757.10s -> 25758.70s]  And I think there's DLC.
[25759.50s -> 25762.68s]  Maybe I'll play the DLC another time.
[25763.67s -> 25768.25s]  Stream is not over yet.
[25768.25s -> 25776.20s]  What's the countdown to beat the old record?
[25776.20s -> 25776.92s]  13 and what?
[25777.48s -> 25778.78s]  About a half an hour.
[25779.64s -> 25780.68s]  Dude, I got to beat the old record.
[25781.24s -> 25789.59s]  What does the DLC even look like?
[25789.59s -> 25790.76s]  How do I get there?
[25790.76s -> 25797.30s]  Start a new campaign.
[25797.30s -> 25797.94s]  Okay.
[25797.94s -> 25802.86s]  Heat is on.
[25802.86s -> 25803.82s]  I just want to see.
[25805.53s -> 25808.60s]  Lots of oil.
[25808.60s -> 25809.08s]  New area.
[25812.55s -> 25813.19s]  I just want to see.
[25813.19s -> 25813.91s]  Welcome to my town.
[25813.91s -> 25814.71s]  I'm the mayor here.
[25814.71s -> 25815.51s]  Is this book, is it me?
[25816.31s -> 25818.28s]  What happened to me?
[25819.00s -> 25822.34s]  Holy shit.
[25825.10s -> 25825.98s]  Wow.
[25825.98s -> 25826.22s]  Okay.
[25828.81s -> 25829.61s]  Yeah, I just wanted to look.
[25830.41s -> 25832.57s]  Start with 200 grand.
[25833.29s -> 25835.69s]  Well, that's a lot of content.
[25835.69s -> 25836.09s]  That's cool.
[25838.94s -> 25841.58s]  Yeah, they're all, we all start with like 200,000.
[25842.54s -> 25844.78s]  Okay.
[25844.78s -> 25845.18s]  Yeah.
[25845.18s -> 25846.46s]  No, I'm not doing it.
[25846.46s -> 25847.06s]  All right.
[25847.06s -> 25848.58s]  What can we do for like 20, 30 minutes?
[25849.62s -> 25852.41s]  That was a very, very enjoyable experience.
[25853.05s -> 25856.23s]  What do we got here?
[25859.54s -> 25861.62s]  No, I'm not doing a tier list.
[25861.62s -> 25862.02s]  Not now.
[25866.06s -> 25867.02s]  20 minutes till dawn?
[25868.38s -> 25869.10s]  Not a bad idea.
[25869.90s -> 25871.18s]  Yeah, we'll go back to that.
[25871.18s -> 25872.46s]  Although that's a little intense.
[25873.34s -> 25878.70s]  Is that too intense?
[25891.42s -> 25891.98s]  Maybe not.
[25892.70s -> 25894.30s]  I think I can just probably sit there with my mouth open.
[25897.30s -> 25898.10s]  Let's try it.
[25898.10s -> 25898.90s]  Let's see if I can do it.
[25899.46s -> 25904.62s]  That was really cool though.
[25904.62s -> 25905.64s]  What a great game.
