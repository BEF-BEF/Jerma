[0.95s -> 9.13s]  Hello, good afternoon. I didn't put this on, so give me a second. I don't know why my profile's
[9.13s -> 15.70s]  not here, but while we set up, just give me a moment. I need to be able to see you guys,
[15.70s -> 24.33s]  which I gotta get this in the right spot. Looks all right, okay. There you guys are,
[24.33s -> 31.10s]  in all your glory. Let's see here. Oh, that's wrong. Why is my, what happened to my profile?
[31.90s -> 42.94s]  I gotta like put the headset on for this. Red text, red text. Sorry, I had to, I had to do
[42.94s -> 53.77s]  phone calls. I get, the headset's gotta be on. Fuck, because I can't tell. Why did my profile
[53.77s -> 59.14s]  not get saved? All right, we're not even close. All right, so I gotta bring you guys forward.
[59.86s -> 66.36s]  So you're gonna come forward. Is there a way I can just grab this in here? I don't think I can.
[67.08s -> 73.62s]  You're not supposed to be seeing this. You're like actually not supposed to be seeing this.
[76.25s -> 95.53s]  Uh, just pretend the intro's still going. Okay, that looks better. Hey, there we go. Sort of,
[95.53s -> 105.93s]  right? Yeah, okay. Hello, how are you? You know, let's put this back up. You guys are too big.
[119.16s -> 128.47s]  All right, how do we look? Hey, there you are. All right, back to the intro. So we are going
[128.47s -> 140.52s]  to be doing more VR. Uh, not drunk today. Not today. We're sober today. We did go over,
[140.52s -> 151.37s]  I was in the chat earlier. We were talking about it. Not today. Yeah, not today. Hung over. No,
[151.37s -> 157.83s]  that was yesterday. That's why I wasn't live yesterday, because I felt fucking like dog shit.
[161.05s -> 166.47s]  Nah, it was a lot of fun. You get a drunk stream maybe like once every few months here.
[167.11s -> 176.60s]  What we're gonna play, we're gonna start with Disassembly VR, which is interesting from the
[176.60s -> 188.70s]  trailer. We might go back to Mind Show. I might also try to beat Jet Island. I don't know. Months,
[188.70s -> 193.58s]  you mean days. Wait, you guys think that's just a drink? Hey, why am I not on camera?
[194.30s -> 204.30s]  I'm an actor. I should be on camera. Uh, depends. We'll just kind of go where the day takes us. Hey,
[204.30s -> 214.52s]  here we go. Uh, you felt like dog shit because you were eaten by the dog. Still didn't shave. I'm not
[214.52s -> 218.12s]  going to. I think I was gonna let it just be, I'm gonna look terrible, but it's fine.
[220.76s -> 232.22s]  Kim check. All right. I'll do a Kim check. There is nobody in there. Right. Okay.
[234.95s -> 238.57s]  I didn't get you though. You got to give me some credit on that one. All right. Let me, uh,
[239.29s -> 251.19s]  make sure everything is right. Let me drink my sewer water. Well, you got a relatable superhero,
[251.19s -> 263.54s]  huh? I'm going to go over some adult things with you guys. Okay. First of all, I, my wardrobe,
[264.50s -> 270.94s]  you've talked about it before. You, I have, you have too. I have a ton of like star wars and
[270.94s -> 276.38s]  superhero and shirts from like the last 10 years and I don't want to get rid of them. They still
[276.38s -> 285.34s]  fit. Eventually I'm going to have to get some adult person clothes, but I, why the, this is
[285.34s -> 291.98s]  fabric. This is like a hundred percent cotton. It's, it protects me from the sun. It protects
[291.98s -> 297.90s]  me from the weather. If it's raining, it protects my skin. What else do I, it covers my like chest
[297.90s -> 312.46s]  and belly button. What else do I need? Do I have to go buy new clothes? This is fine. Yeah. I need
[312.46s -> 317.90s]  to get a suit. I'm not, I can't wear suits. Suits make me uncomfortable. I don't know how people
[317.90s -> 325.02s]  wear those every day with the tie and the button up and the blazer and the pants and like the cigar.
[325.02s -> 331.18s]  I couldn't do that. I would melt inside of that thing. I would need, okay, for me, a suit is the
[331.18s -> 336.54s]  same thing as wearing a mascot costume for like a high school football team. Okay. They have air
[336.54s -> 341.74s]  conditioning units that sit right here. If I was going to get a full suit, I would need one of
[341.74s -> 350.66s]  those. They have to make them for weirdos like me. A cigar. Yeah. Like a cigar. They just like
[350.66s -> 356.22s]  businessman. They just smoke cigars in the office. You've been inside of an office. It's like, it's
[356.22s -> 366.12s]  like worse than a casino. It's full of fucking thick cigar smoke. All right. Let's get in here.
[366.12s -> 370.87s]  I'm not going to fuck around anymore. Welcome. Hope you're having a good day. I'm doing all right.
[370.87s -> 382.14s]  I'm having a good day. Germa's stuck in the 1950s. I saw that show, Mad Men. They just drink
[382.14s -> 388.81s]  scotch and smoke cigars. Nobody goes, nobody works. They just have competitions with who can like
[388.81s -> 399.59s]  smell like more wine to each other. There's no, that's what you do at work. Let me get in here.
[402.38s -> 406.62s]  Make better jokes so the stock goes up. I ain't talking about stocks today.
[407.82s -> 414.46s]  I'm talking about taking things apart in VR. This is Disassembly. The ultimate reality
[414.46s -> 424.12s]  destruction game. This looks kind of fun. This might be your new favorite. I untangled everything.
[425.24s -> 434.31s]  Weirdly enough, I don't even do this shit when I'm sober. I cleaned up everything. I plugged in both
[434.31s -> 441.06s]  the controllers, which I don't do that so sober. I wiped down the lenses. Like I drunk cleaned up
[441.06s -> 449.90s]  this room. I don't know how, but thankfully these things are at a hundred percent. All right. Let's
[449.90s -> 466.55s]  go. Give me the other one. Welcome to VR. No drinking tonight. I didn't know what my tools are.
[466.55s -> 478.46s]  They are. This is left hand? Yes. We talked about this already in the chat before the stream,
[478.46s -> 482.70s]  but you know when you drink and maybe you drink like you drink a little too much, you have,
[482.70s -> 487.82s]  you get a little drunk and you open up your phone and oh, did I text anybody? No. Let me check.
[487.82s -> 493.10s]  Just check for five seconds. Okay. No, I didn't text anybody last night. No, whatever. I was fine.
[493.10s -> 499.66s]  I didn't call anybody, right? Okay. No. Seven and a half hours of VODs. That was my, did I text
[499.66s -> 509.59s]  anybody last night? Like, oh, Josh. A fucking eight hours of on camera. What did I do? Did I
[509.59s -> 523.03s]  do anything fucked up? No, I kid. I was completely with it the whole time, but yeah. Oh, let me just
[523.03s -> 531.64s]  check my phone. I don't think I did anything bad. I was fine. It's almost 2 AM in Australia. This
[531.64s -> 539.77s]  stream better be worth it. Oh my God. Way to put the pressure on. What? This better be worth it.
[539.77s -> 549.70s]  Oh my God. Now you got me all fucked up. Can you guys hear this? I think I need to unmute this.
[549.70s -> 563.93s]  Yeah, I do. It's a pretty good royalty free soundtrack. All right. Disassembly. Welcome
[563.93s -> 572.01s]  to Disassembly VR. Feel free to try out the tools. Feel free to try out the tools and weapons on
[572.01s -> 576.89s]  your right to get used to the controls. Close this message by aiming your right hand and pressing
[576.89s -> 584.73s]  the trigger button below. Okay. You can show this help again in settings. All right. Here we go.
[585.45s -> 591.70s]  So wait, I can, this is a game about taking things apart. How do I walk?
[597.94s -> 607.14s]  Uh, probably need the info here. Uh, okay. How do I move? Touch pad movement mode.
[607.70s -> 628.06s]  Press. All right. So I can grip to use. Is it going to explode? No, that's a prop. It's not
[628.06s -> 636.98s]  going to do anything. Tools. Grip to, oh, okay. I see. I don't know. How do I use it though?
[639.27s -> 642.07s]  God, this is fucking loud. Turn it down.
[644.63s -> 649.91s]  Wait, how do I turn loudness down? I don't want to hear this music. I'm sorry. That's just the way
[649.91s -> 664.92s]  it is. Where's the audio? Is there no audio settings? Okay. So how do I, ah, all right.
[665.96s -> 688.54s]  Let's go over here. Ah, what am I, what is this? Is this a bomb? I don't know what this is. Oh shit,
[688.86s -> 692.78s]  the battery. All right. What am I, is this the tutorial? If I can get this open, then I win.
[705.11s -> 720.73s]  It's just a parrot fucking screams at you. How do I get this off? This is, I could take,
[720.73s -> 727.18s]  can I take it off? Oh, what the fuck? Okay. Do I have to put something in here?
[728.22s -> 738.57s]  I think I'm ready to play. Oh, side table. Well, I am fucking like 15 feet tall.
[739.69s -> 744.33s]  Side table, lamp, speaker, side table. Let's just do something easy.
[749.91s -> 756.55s]  Well, it was a bomb. I just took the bomb apart. I think it deserves a couple of claps.
[759.80s -> 765.06s]  I might have to turn this all down completely. Hold on. Let me just turn this all down. It's
[765.06s -> 775.80s]  fucking loud. That like, all right. How's it, is it good for you guys? Is it loud for you guys?
[775.80s -> 784.57s]  What do you think? What kind of fucked up studio am I in? All right. I think we're good. All right.
[784.57s -> 795.10s]  So, uh, parts, there's 40, I'm timed. There's 42 parts. All right. How do I get rid of this?
[795.99s -> 804.47s]  Okay. So what I have to take this apart. All right. Wait, I've got to unscrew these. What
[804.47s -> 817.11s]  have I tools? Do I have to do it with my hands? I have to undo this with my hands. Okay. Uh,
[817.91s -> 829.62s]  is there any more parts? I think this one's done. Is it? What? Oh, they're okay. Get this off.
[832.46s -> 836.94s]  Okay. Can I fall out there? Can I actually go out the window? I gotta, I gotta get this clean.
[836.94s -> 846.58s]  Hold on. What is my hand? What am I, like Inspector Gadget? Go, go Gadget. Finger drill.
[847.46s -> 867.83s]  What? I can't even pick this up. Do I need to hold on to these? All right. Why am I trying to
[867.83s -> 877.78s]  hit my knee? Oh my God. It's a lot. All right. I need a tool. Where are my tools? Tools? Do I not,
[877.78s -> 888.90s]  are they inside? No, there are no tools in here. I cannot, I have to redo the whole thing now.
[891.51s -> 917.88s]  Why am I like floating around? Wait. Go, go. This just became another game. Where is this house?
[920.22s -> 941.94s]  Uh, whose house is this? It's just a floating cube. It's not, it's just a floating room. This
[941.94s -> 954.81s]  is like a Black Mirror episode. All right. How do I, where are my tools? Movement, turn the movement
[954.81s -> 962.62s]  speed up. All right. There we go. That's better. Don't I get tools? Maybe I don't, maybe I don't
[962.62s -> 980.68s]  get tools. Get in there. I'm here to save you. How do I get down? I'm just flying. Do I float down?
[983.88s -> 1011.00s]  Go down here. Stop flying. Why do I stop flying? What am I going to do again?
[1011.64s -> 1019.02s]  I don't know what the fuck I did there. I have to swim? All right. I don't get tools. I have to
[1019.02s -> 1051.59s]  take out 42 parts. Oh, stop it. Come on. All right. Are we good? No, I'm still too big.
[1052.47s -> 1068.82s]  Okay. Let's get the, I'm going to get this for real now. Okay. How about I get parts?
[1069.80s -> 1081.77s]  40, 38. Okay. Here we go. This is where I glue I think maybe. Okay. Cool. Let's get them in a pile.
[1083.70s -> 1101.35s]  Why do you think they can broken glass out? Can I not pull this off? What's that say? Tool required.
[1103.70s -> 1111.86s]  I don't have any tools. All right. Let's get, let's, I think it's all right. Let's get this all off.
[1119.35s -> 1135.75s]  What do I get for doing this? Oh, cool. All right. Can I take the top off? How do I get a screwdriver?
[1136.31s -> 1147.51s]  Why would you put me in this room without a screwdriver? You understand? You have to build
[1147.51s -> 1181.94s]  a tool. What do you mean build a tool? Smash it. I, that's not working. I, no, I don't want to save
[1181.94s -> 1190.73s]  the screenshot. Maybe I can't do this one. The door behind me? That doesn't know a door here.
[1192.57s -> 1208.78s]  I, I need like access to a tool. What did I just do? What is this thing? Check your pants. Tool belt.
[1211.32s -> 1217.88s]  No, I don't, I just have two floating like magician hands. This is just the Smash Brothers boss. Hold
[1217.88s -> 1249.34s]  on. There has to be a way to get this off. Come on. Grip button. Press. There has to be a way to
[1249.34s -> 1268.04s]  get off to this. Why? Why? Why would that even be possible? Look, I can see it. I can do it with my
[1268.04s -> 1283.56s]  teeth. I swear to God, I'll get it. Tool required. I can't open it. Use a shard of glass. Holy shit,
[1283.56s -> 1308.54s]  that person's correct. Wow. Are you kidding me? I'm gonna get hurt. Give me a piece of glass. Okay.
[1309.10s -> 1337.59s]  Here we go. I'm just gonna use the pointed end right here. Can I get this smaller? That's not
[1337.59s -> 1359.83s]  gonna work. The panels? This is exactly what it's like when you build your own Ikea desk.
[1359.83s -> 1364.55s]  Seriously. What do you mean the panel? Help me. Glass on the panel. What about this thing?
[1365.27s -> 1399.10s]  What is this? Can I use this? Just get out in the middle here. Do it to me. There's a point right
[1399.10s -> 1417.24s]  here. Be careful with this. Be careful with this one. One false move and say goodbye. Oh my God.
[1417.24s -> 1445.19s]  This is too hard. Oh no. What? Right menu button?
[1461.29s -> 1473.34s]  Left right to choose. Grip to use. Oh my God. I can't fucking believe it. That would not break
[1473.34s -> 1482.92s]  the glass behind me. You fucking caveman. These weigh like a quarter of an ounce. Did I get it?
[1482.92s -> 1501.77s]  All right. Oh. Mission complete. It's hard to see where the lines are right now. Where am I?
[1508.01s -> 1518.47s]  Got it. What other tools do I have? I got a wrench. I got a hex wrench, crowbar, precision driver,
[1518.47s -> 1528.94s]  test pen, finder? No, part finder. What is it? What are these? Precision driver, pliers?
[1545.53s -> 1558.49s]  Get it off. Get it off. This is the tutorial. Just give me where the screwdriver goes.
[1558.49s -> 1577.43s]  Okay. Let's go. Guys. So this is what it looks like inside. Interesting. I thought it was like
[1577.43s -> 1582.07s]  a bunch of wires and computer parts and stuff because for a desk to open those doors to open,
[1582.07s -> 1594.55s]  I'm surprised it's this simple. All right. Now I can. Oh, the support's going down.
[1598.38s -> 1604.49s]  All right. Stop breaking the glass. It's going to give me a headache. All right. Now what?
[1607.88s -> 1616.74s]  Oh, top is off. Now can I pull these? I think I can pull the sides off now. Let's get in a good
[1616.74s -> 1634.74s]  position. Okay. Now I can pull this off. How do I get this off? What's down there? What is this?
[1638.89s -> 1649.94s]  Coin? This is mine. I got it. I win. There's nine more parts. Side table. I did it.
[1652.66s -> 1668.15s]  I did it. I win. Now what? Did I do it? Wait. There's another one. Wait. Parts six.
[1668.87s -> 1676.06s]  There's two more of these somewhere. It's right there, right? Where's the other one?
[1676.06s -> 1689.48s]  How do I take that? What are the other parts? Parts. There's six more parts. I don't think I
[1689.48s -> 1701.40s]  can do anything with this. The base can't be pulled apart. Take out the park finder.
[1702.04s -> 1725.82s]  Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, they're coming in. The invasion. Sir, they're coming in 44 knots a second.
[1726.38s -> 1805.24s]  All right. It's right. What? How can? There's three parts left. What are they? One, two, three.
[1805.24s -> 1817.35s]  That's it. Disassemble. Best time. Two hours and 42 minutes. Two minutes and 42 seconds?
[1818.15s -> 1843.51s]  I've been live for 31 minutes. Two minutes? I don't understand that. Hold on. Can you guys
[1843.51s -> 1857.64s]  not hear the sound effect? Well, that's odd. But this game, I kind of like this game. That was the
[1857.64s -> 1871.88s]  side table. What's next? Show it to me. So that's it. Let's go to the next one. All right. Main menu.
[1871.88s -> 1888.20s]  So we did that. Side table complete. All right. We did lamp. Oh, we're in this fucking room again.
[1888.20s -> 1893.70s]  All right. Now I know how to play. Let's see. Is it connected? Not connected to anything. Let's
[1893.70s -> 1898.10s]  get a good look at it. Anything on the bottom? No, there's this wire here.
[1912.76s -> 1920.94s]  Just stand here. Oh my fuck. Whatever. Just leave it. All right. So what do we got? How many parts?
[1921.74s -> 1929.02s]  39. All right. Let's go. Screwdriver. We got, what do we got? We got a couple of screwdriver points.
[1930.47s -> 1940.49s]  No. Is this screwed on? No, I don't get it. I'm done. Take the bulb out, right?
[1942.81s -> 1961.62s]  Oh, that actually like hurt me in real life. No, just call me shaky hands, Elbertson.
[1962.26s -> 1967.85s]  All right. Let me try to get in here with the precision game. God. All right. I gotta get the
[1967.85s -> 1978.06s]  wire cutters. These are wires, right? Why? Oh, I've got a complete item pack 10 to unlock.
[1979.29s -> 2009.56s]  What? How do I get this? How do I undo this? Come on, get in there. Nice. Okay. We're getting there.
[2009.56s -> 2031.40s]  What's holding this in? Stand up. I wish you could just stand up. Stand up. Stay. No, stay. What tool?
[2031.40s -> 2054.70s]  Electric pliers. Test pen. I can't, I can't like push it in there. Precision driver. Hex wrench.
[2055.26s -> 2063.56s]  Screwdriver. Mannequin. Gravity gun. Rocket launcher. C4. Grenade. Classic assault rifle.
[2066.01s -> 2078.79s]  X-ray glasses. Magnifying glass. I need the tweezers, I think. Shoot it. I can't buy it.
[2078.79s -> 2098.17s]  Gamer glasses. It's the precision driver. Is it though? Wait, I need like a tiny screwdriver.
[2098.97s -> 2132.30s]  See what I mean? Will the screwdriver get that? Okay. How many parts are left? 24?
[2133.10s -> 2146.44s]  Nothing. I gotta get in here. I gotta get in there. Okay. And the, the puncher. I need the puncher.
[2147.16s -> 2171.86s]  What about, how? Oh, what happened? Oh, God. That was like taking out an ingrown hair. That was,
[2171.86s -> 2185.27s]  you know what? DLC. DLC. Whoever made this game. Ingrown hair removal. Right? No? No. Yeah,
[2185.27s -> 2195.50s]  like little tweezers pulling it. Ah, whatever. You guys don't get it. We got 21 more parts.
[2195.50s -> 2221.74s]  They're all connected to here. Get a screwdriver again. This is kind of fun. You know what? I'm
[2221.74s -> 2227.14s]  getting like a house flipper vibes. Because you can't do this with stuff in your house.
[2227.14s -> 2234.30s]  You won't work anymore. If you wanted to do this, you wouldn't be able to do it.
[2235.59s -> 2243.21s]  Your mother would yell at you. This gives you an outlet. Okay, now just pull it apart. You know?
[2243.21s -> 2260.73s]  This is what it looks like inside. Ooh. Whoa. Well, that's, that's the worm that's inside.
[2260.73s -> 2270.70s]  It's a skeleton. This is what it looks like inside. Nice. We got four more.
[2280.58s -> 2291.78s]  Six minutes for a lamp. Record time. Praise the sun. All right. What's the next one? Speaker.
[2291.78s -> 2301.80s]  What else do we have? A house. You have to take apart a house with like a screwdriver.
[2302.76s -> 2315.85s]  Um, the Titanic, a screwdriver, a rice cooker, a car, an airplane, a toaster,
[2317.88s -> 2327.45s]  a skyscraper, a tank. Oh, they, okay. This is, they're not fucking around. You thought this game
[2327.45s -> 2334.20s]  was like a little joke. Just wait till we get to the fucking plane, the car. We have to start small
[2334.20s -> 2342.60s]  though. We're, I got to work my way up. This is fun. Uh, it's basic. This is a real basic game,
[2343.58s -> 2349.67s]  but I honestly, this is what I would recommend for VR. Like your father or your grandfather.
[2350.82s -> 2354.82s]  They love this shit. You know, they like to go into the garage and just like fucking put
[2354.82s -> 2360.26s]  things together and take them apart and put it back together again. My grandfather took apart
[2360.26s -> 2367.59s]  clocks and put the clocks back together. That's a lie. I don't know anyone that's ever done that.
[2367.59s -> 2373.50s]  I think I actually stole that from like a Disney made for TV movie. Well, I don't know where I'm
[2373.50s -> 2378.18s]  getting that from. That happens in a movie and it was like, it's my pretending that was my
[2378.18s -> 2385.37s]  grandfather. That's my pretend grandfather. All right, here we go. Speaker. Had to do it once.
[2385.93s -> 2401.78s]  No, go back, go back, go back. That was a waste of time. That was in Star Wars. Put some tunes on.
[2403.70s -> 2408.66s]  I don't know. I don't know if like, I mean, the music in this game is like default music.
[2409.30s -> 2428.02s]  What we got? Q R S. If you go back and watch, somebody mentioned this and we talked about it
[2428.02s -> 2433.78s]  before the spring. Every single character does this with their hands during that.
[2434.34s -> 2440.81s]  I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I didn't tweet the fight either. No.
[2442.36s -> 2456.84s]  All right, let's go. What do we got? Speaker. It just feels cool to do this. How many parts?
[2457.40s -> 2472.44s]  My father was, oh God, 43 parts. This is a big one. I can't wait to get the power drill.
[2474.25s -> 2482.66s]  That's for winners though. Okay, that's that. Let's put this down carefully. A lot of glare.
[2483.46s -> 2491.16s]  This is what the inside of a speaker looks like. Interesting. All right, how do I get that?
[2491.96s -> 2504.10s]  Dude, what? I thought it was full of liquid. I thought it was kinetic liquid. All right,
[2504.18s -> 2508.12s]  no more of those. So that's that. Let's turn it back around.
[2515.38s -> 2532.28s]  Okay. Ah, I got to take those out. Have we done the base? Dude. All right. No, nothing else here.
[2532.28s -> 2538.26s]  I don't think because it's just the charcoal. Wow. That's it. Huh?
[2540.66s -> 2553.72s]  Oops. Well, I need that. Don't make a mess. Can, is this just one part or can I pull this part
[2553.72s -> 2565.38s]  completely? I think this is just one piece. This on the other hand, I've got to work with.
[2569.94s -> 2582.89s]  What do we got left? 20 parts. Raspberry P. Do I have to get in there and take all those off?
[2582.89s -> 2600.50s]  What about the wires? There's 13 more parts. What are the other 13 parts? I need to get tool
[2601.22s -> 2618.38s]  pliers, right? No. How do I get these out? These? Oh, I think it's, no. Are you serious?
[2619.02s -> 2644.22s]  I get to get them with a crowbar? No, that's not right. Maybe I can't. Shouldn't I be? Wait,
[2644.22s -> 2664.52s]  they wouldn't. No. How do I get this out? Just a regular screwdriver? No. Flip the table. I can't.
[2664.52s -> 2671.98s]  I'm not strong enough. You used to see, I don't have the C4 unlocked yet. How do I get this? Do
[2671.98s -> 2685.99s]  I have to grab it from this side? No. Tool required. None of these worked. Hmm. You'd think
[2685.99s -> 2693.14s]  it would be pliers. Apparently not. Yeah, like that's what I thought too. But look,
[2693.94s -> 2704.17s]  tool, I don't think I can do that. Try to take the, well, I know these probably have some stuff in
[2704.17s -> 2713.26s]  them like this right here, right? Well, this is going to be tricky. Like a fucking dentist.
[2718.01s -> 2725.40s]  Dentist game. Dentist DLC. You can like pull teeth out and stuff and like correct. You got the,
[2725.40s -> 2738.22s]  you already have the engine here now. What? How do I do that on the other one? I don't even know
[2738.30s -> 2753.98s]  what I'm pulling out. Okay. These, I need to get that out, right? Apparently not. I don't get it.
[2753.98s -> 2767.85s]  Still 10 pieces. Use the other pliers? They're unlocked. I can't even, I have to beat item pack
[2767.85s -> 2801.86s]  four to get these. Why is that person here? Hmm, nothing. This is the wires that fell from down
[2801.86s -> 2819.27s]  here. I can't go out the window. Guys, can you use the, yeah, the park finder maybe.
[2820.07s -> 2872.60s]  It's probably not a bad idea. Is it right here? Hold on. Like, is it this thing? What? Oh no,
[2872.60s -> 2890.78s]  he's going for a tombstone. So what is this thing? Is it? All right. So I don't get, what the hell is
[2890.78s -> 2910.73s]  in here? Ah, look at that. Okay. Six, one, two, three, four. All right. Three now. It's this stupid
[2910.73s -> 2930.39s]  thing right here. This is one, two. All right. Give me this. Turn it on. How do I get you open?
[2931.03s -> 2943.43s]  How do I get this open? Just take it out. Put it, I'm not going to put it there.
[2943.43s -> 2956.81s]  Test pen. Oh, I can delete that. That's good. Test pen. Why did I try that?
[2957.61s -> 2977.80s]  There's one more part. What is it? All right. Open up. It's time for your cleaning.
[3012.41s -> 3020.71s]  Nine minutes. Not a big deal. Best time. All right. I was not expecting that.
[3027.77s -> 3037.75s]  Sticker. All right. Item pack one complete. Item pack two. Pocket knife, microscope, and antique
[3037.75s -> 3051.82s]  car. This wasn't going to be fun. All right. 23 parts. All right. All right. Is it alive or what?
[3067.38s -> 3072.81s]  Okay. Let me see if I can identify all these. So we have, wait, there's one more.
[3073.45s -> 3083.66s]  See if I can identify everything. So we've got baby scissors to cut literally nothing because
[3083.66s -> 3087.99s]  there's no reason to have those. They don't do anything. They're just there for you to pretend
[3087.99s -> 3091.67s]  that on a Swiss army knife, that's there for you to pretend it's a monster and you could like make
[3091.67s -> 3099.34s]  a voice. My grandfather used to do that. Knife. That is dull enough for you to spread cream cheese
[3099.34s -> 3105.74s]  on a bagel. So I mean not really that useful. Spring. Well, I don't know what you'd use a spring
[3105.74s -> 3111.74s]  for to like pretend to bounce it. What use does that have? Then you have like the assassin's creed
[3111.74s -> 3118.33s]  assassin dagger. You know, you like that. Here is your can opener, which is pretty useful if you're
[3118.33s -> 3127.05s]  camping. There's the fish knife to collate the fish. And then here is the hind leg to prop it
[3127.05s -> 3132.70s]  up like a bike. Oh, and the key chain. So there you go. That's pretty much how this works.
[3133.50s -> 3141.88s]  Is he talking shit about Swiss army knives? No, look at how useful this is.
[3144.82s -> 3151.78s]  That's useful. That's useful. That's useful. That's useful. Not useful. Don't, not useful.
[3153.54s -> 3157.86s]  That's useful. So, all right. So like 75% of this is useful. The rest is just there for fun.
[3169.99s -> 3176.81s]  Fucking rabbit. Scissors are dead weight. All right. I don't like that noise. You replace the scissors
[3176.81s -> 3182.09s]  with, okay, you want to know how you make that cool? Instead of scissors, have it pull up a
[3182.09s -> 3194.50s]  little roll, a little mini roll of tape, like scotch tape, even if it was like two slabs. How
[3194.50s -> 3232.82s]  is that useful? You do the math. Oh, I gotta get this one off. Whoa. Get out. Get out of here.
[3236.04s -> 3246.33s]  That's how it, that's it? Oh, they're, these are all gonna fall down. Cool. There's the spring.
[3247.75s -> 3253.38s]  All right. I want everyone in chat to be real with me here. What does this, what do you use this for?
[3256.50s -> 3263.38s]  What is this for in this? It's a corkscrew? No, for what? For wine? Why is half this shit to open
[3263.38s -> 3272.10s]  bottle of alcohol? But what do you do with this? Is this essential to survival? To like open a
[3272.10s -> 3280.41s]  wine bottle? No. Replace this with like pez. Have like three pez here instead of this.
[3281.13s -> 3297.51s]  See, let me show you the use for this thing. Ready? Like, hey, it's me. I'm a scummy monster.
[3297.51s -> 3300.71s]  That's what my fucking grandfather did in the middle of his spare time when he was building
[3300.71s -> 3319.74s]  and taking apart clocks. What is this? Oh, the shaver. That's useful. Look at this. Look at
[3319.74s -> 3336.20s]  it. Look at the precision here. There that goes. Okay. Is that it? Four more parts.
[3336.84s -> 3350.49s]  On the back of this maybe? What? Oh, right here. Oh, okay. Is somebody breaking in? What?
[3350.49s -> 3355.05s]  Somebody just threw a baseball. God damn kids, that's why my study. I wanted to have it against
[3355.05s -> 3361.83s]  the other side. Away from the neighbor's backyard. I'm taking apart shit and putting it back together.
[3363.11s -> 3369.82s]  Fucking rotten little shits. But we want to play baseball. Get out of here. Get out of there for
[3369.82s -> 3435.58s]  me. Shit. Where did it go? Fuck. No. God damn it. Where is it? Does anybody see it?
[3447.75s -> 3461.86s]  Damn it. That's the second ball this week. Hello. Yes, this is the police. I've got a few rotten
[3461.86s -> 3470.74s]  kids that have been hitting baseballs into my window. Yeah. Thank you. Send two squad cars.
[3470.74s -> 3491.10s]  It looks like they're having a good time out there. Andrew, put them away. Okay, give me this back.
[3491.10s -> 3531.80s]  It's this thing right here. Just shut it out. Oh, fuck. I can't move. No. No, wait, wait, wait.
[3559.43s -> 3566.22s]  This is going to be fun finding this part. This is going to take like $400 million in like the
[3566.22s -> 3573.30s]  entire state of Washington to find this. Oh, god damn it.
[3578.52s -> 3587.46s]  Just reset. What? No, I'm already done. Hold on. Did anybody see it? Where is it?
[3594.52s -> 3604.95s]  It's apparently right in front of my face. Look, snorkeling in my own house. Is it still forward?
[3605.83s -> 3640.73s]  Wait, did you see it? I think I saw it. Wait, what do you mean? It's the...
[3641.21s -> 3697.27s]  Oh, nice. Very good. Very good. Amen. All right, we got a microscope and then an antique car.
[3697.91s -> 3706.57s]  This one's probably going to be a lot. This is 43 parts. How are we going to get a car in here?
[3706.57s -> 3719.88s]  Oh, Jesus. Okay. Well, what can I look at it first? Don't lose anything. Oh, wait, you guys can't see
[3719.88s -> 3728.71s]  that. Now you can. I have put my hand under here. You can't see anything? No, well, I'm probably
[3728.71s -> 3748.57s]  going to take those apart. Okay. No, no. Okay. Going good. Some of these might have to be
[3748.57s -> 3767.37s]  completely taken apart. Oh, that felt good. Oops. This game's really cool, but I'll tell you.
[3768.76s -> 3773.21s]  Being able just to go like this means somebody didn't put this together correctly.
[3773.21s -> 3779.98s]  They didn't use any glue, tape, screws. It was, they just jenged this thing together.
[3783.56s -> 3803.30s]  Whoa. Why is there like smoke here? Oh, turn it off. Rotten motherfuckers.
[3815.59s -> 3828.34s]  Yes, me again. I don't know. Somebody's driving by and going loud and honking and shit. Yes. Yes,
[3828.34s -> 3834.58s]  I'm aware, but I'm a part of my neighborhood watch. I'm like, yes. Yes, I know I call six
[3834.58s -> 3846.06s]  times a week. You've already got with it, but you haven't. I'm a preferred member of my community.
[3846.06s -> 3856.33s]  Give me my other phone. I got two cell phones for this reason. Hey, no, no, it's going to be
[3856.33s -> 3876.55s]  forever. No, it's not. Get it both off, right? Oh, we got just too wild and crazy guys. Oh,
[3876.55s -> 3881.50s]  my God. I'm going to break something. Oh, who cares? It's not going to turn on. Get me back down
[3881.50s -> 3897.30s]  here. Any of our other cell phones. Oh no. Charlie. Charlie. Oh, this is ridiculous. Charlie. Oh,
[3897.62s -> 3913.64s]  the fan. Wait, wait, Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, work. Charlie, it's working. Charlie, get me down.
[3918.26s -> 3931.03s]  Okay. Why is it so complicated to move? Jesus Christ. Oh no, it's not going to stop.
[3931.59s -> 3941.82s]  I got to do this quick. How many parts are left? 25. Okay, we're going to get silent now. Oh,
[3941.82s -> 3978.36s]  God damn it. Whatever. Why did I fucking do that? It's stuck onto this one. Charlie. Drink it again
[3978.36s -> 4031.50s]  quick. Nice and quiet. That's the way I like it. That's the way I like it. I'm going to need that
[4031.50s -> 4055.45s]  later. There's the light. Very bright. How do I turn this off? No, I just made it brighter. I want
[4055.45s -> 4061.99s]  to turn this off. The light is so bright, I can't even focus. Turn it around. Okay, any more parts
[4061.99s -> 4081.13s]  here? Okay, little ploppers. Okay, can I take the back off? You can. All right. Oh my goodness,
[4081.13s -> 4085.05s]  the whole thing comes off, right? Is there anything else in here? Because I kind of want to just get
[4085.05s -> 4095.90s]  rid of this. I think this is just one big piece. So get this away from me because the light is too
[4095.90s -> 4106.23s]  much. All right, what do we got? 15 parts. The little ones, right? Maybe this? Can I get inside
[4106.23s -> 4123.78s]  here? No. No. Okay, there's that one. Done. All right, a couple more of these clickers.
[4124.82s -> 4153.66s]  Click. No. Come on. How many more? Nine. No. Take these apart maybe? The glass inside? No,
[4153.66s -> 4179.05s]  there we go. Any more? How many more? Four. Where are they? Anything else on here? That's
[4179.05s -> 4204.90s]  two? Where are the last two? No. No. Not this, right? No. I'm like eating my lip. I had it?
[4204.90s -> 4239.72s]  That's one more part. Where is it? Where is it? Stop chewing on your lip. I'm like concentrating
[4239.72s -> 4276.36s]  like, that's not it. Huh? Cute. All right, I'm gonna drink some water. Let's back it up for a
[4276.36s -> 4308.84s]  second. This game's fucking fun. This is just relaxing. All right. Clean the lens a little.
[4308.84s -> 4312.44s]  My greasy face. There's like water in here. That's how disgusting I am as a human being.
[4322.71s -> 4339.10s]  All right. Let's get back in. Just want to get some water. Stay hydrated. All right. Good to go.
[4340.06s -> 4352.82s]  Car coming up. Old-fashioned car. Antique car. Oh wow. Oh, there's like a smudge on the lens.
[4353.78s -> 4370.71s]  God damn it. Hold on. That's gonna bother me. That's better. So, I am supposed to take this
[4370.71s -> 4396.82s]  thing apart with a wrench. Is that what I understand here? There's 52 parts. Brutal. No,
[4396.82s -> 4420.57s]  no. Get in the car. No. Get back. Come here. How do I move reliably? Seriously. Okay. Well,
[4420.57s -> 4463.85s]  that's a start. Does it still work? Hold on. I'm gonna drive this thing around. Wait, you mean I
[4463.85s -> 4472.39s]  could teleport this whole time? How the hell did I just do that? What? I could teleport this whole
[4472.39s -> 4498.57s]  time? You mean I've been swimming around for no reason? What the fuck? Yeah. Brutal. What did I
[4498.57s -> 4505.88s]  just do before? All right. The controls changed. I pressed the same button I pressed last time.
[4506.68s -> 4521.34s]  I swear to God. I was pressing up. What happened? Use the D pad? That's what I did last time. Now
[4521.34s -> 4530.73s]  I'm teleporting. Okay. It's not that. It's not left or right. This is now teleporting. No. See,
[4530.73s -> 4570.17s]  look. Look at this. Okay. Slow down. Turn it. Turn. Slow, slow, slow, slow. It only works when it's
[4570.17s -> 4606.66s]  highlighted. All right. Now let's actually do it. All right. What is this? A headlight? Doesn't do
[4606.66s -> 4619.69s]  anything. Engine. Why? No, this is the air filter that brings in cool, clean air. Comes out. That's
[4619.69s -> 4631.53s]  how your air conditioning works. Make sure there's nothing else in here. Okay. This. I just want to
[4631.53s -> 4647.34s]  show you guys how this shit works. Turn it on. Was it the engine? I can't turn the engine on now.
[4651.56s -> 4680.36s]  Why? I was gonna do it manually. I can take that off. Easy. What is that? This is the wing.
[4684.46s -> 4695.27s]  What is this? It's a weight. Nothing. I don't have to take anything up far here, right?
[4696.39s -> 4710.31s]  Okay. Another piece of glass. This is the second headlight. I don't think they're going to do
[4710.31s -> 4723.86s]  anything else with that. It's the wheels. I don't want to fuck with the wheels yet. Test it first.
[4730.52s -> 4741.06s]  What? Okay. Well, I was trying to punch through it. All right. Spare wheel. I can take the inside out
[4741.06s -> 4747.00s]  as well. I do. They thought of everything, didn't they? They thought of everything, didn't they?
[4747.96s -> 4762.33s]  Well, let's go ahead and get the tools out. We'll deal with that later. Put all the tires
[4762.33s -> 4773.26s]  over here. This is the danger cone. Oh, this is this bike seat for somebody else in the back.
[4773.90s -> 4787.90s]  What's in here? You are very strong in this game. All right. This might. I'm going to have to take
[4787.90s -> 4797.80s]  a look at that later. This is this. This is the. I can just pick these up. Those are the. I don't
[4797.80s -> 4801.80s]  even know if that was holding up that thing. All right. Here's the other wing. Oh shit. I have to
[4801.80s -> 4811.59s]  take it off that wing. Wow. This car is. These things are really basic, huh?
[4813.75s -> 4821.96s]  Get that one. It just hit me right in the mouth and knocked all of my teeth out.
[4821.96s -> 4831.75s]  All right. This is the back. Let's go like this. Can I get this off? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Don't
[4831.75s -> 4844.18s]  do that yet. This thing's going to freak the fuck out and flip over. What's going on? What's
[4844.18s -> 4857.40s]  happening? That was weird. Okay. Oh shit. All right. The weight. I got to get some weight
[4857.40s -> 4868.49s]  distribution. The whole thing is going to come down. Can I take this? All right. This is going
[4868.49s -> 4874.15s]  to. The whole car will fall. Not yet. I'm going to get the doors and the other crap that's over here.
[4874.87s -> 4889.00s]  Now I need a tool. Can I open this? I'm just like breaking these things. All right. It's fine.
[4892.42s -> 4909.61s]  Take the top off. That leaves us with the engine. Now get the doors off. How much more parts? 27.
[4912.87s -> 4917.88s]  Use the hammer. I don't have access to the hammer. I haven't unlocked the hammer. I have like a bunch
[4917.88s -> 4938.87s]  of tools I still need to unlock. I can't take this off yet because it's buried in here. All right.
[4938.87s -> 4952.66s]  Hold on. Can I take off the roof? Okay. I can get the roof. All right. It's starting to look
[4952.66s -> 4972.76s]  a little skeleton here. Get the seat out. All right. Now let me get the tire. How do I get this off?
[4972.84s -> 4995.53s]  I can't rip this off. Do I need another tool for this? Pop the tire. How the fuck do I get this off?
[4997.24s -> 5020.09s]  How do I get this off? Behind you. I don't even say that. Use the wrench. Oh, okay. Oh shit. Okay.
[5020.09s -> 5034.34s]  We're almost. How many more parts? 22. Not even close. No, no. Stop hitting the wall.
[5034.34s -> 5088.52s]  Oh. Yes. My plan worked. Who needs a wrench? How many more parts?
[5089.32s -> 5112.10s]  15. There's the engine. Get that over there. What's this part? Okay. Can't get that off yet.
[5113.70s -> 5125.82s]  Can I get the wheel? Yep. Oh, yes. This is where it all just falls apart. You just look at it. It's
[5125.82s -> 5132.17s]  just so tender. It falls off the bump. Look at that. Look at that. All it took was 12 minutes
[5132.17s -> 5137.30s]  in the new wave oven and it's just so. The bone, the meat just is. Do you see that?
[5142.89s -> 5152.25s]  Take a look at this. The meat just falls off the bump. Watch out though because it can
[5152.25s -> 5172.57s]  fucking spray up at you. All right. There's still things I need to do here. Shit. Is it the engine?
[5181.05s -> 5193.54s]  Nothing else on the engine? Uh oh. I need to get the part thing out. Oh, it's the wheels.
[5194.18s -> 5211.82s]  The wheels, right? Come on. The wheels, these things, look it. The middle has to come out of
[5211.82s -> 5240.63s]  them, right? Whoa. Oh, never mind. Coral bar. Get out of there. What's left? It's the tires.
[5240.63s -> 5277.34s]  He's done it again. Perfect. How many more? Two more tires? Three more? What was the other one?
[5277.34s -> 5292.82s]  Right there. That's it. There's one more. Is there one more tire? Let's get a bird's eye view here.
[5292.82s -> 5360.62s]  Tire. Tire. Tire. Shit. Over here? Whoa. It's this. What do you mean this? What is this?
[5362.76s -> 5397.56s]  Oh, I got 13 minutes. Classic bomb unlocked. I got a bomb. Got a bomb. Robot. Safe bicycle.
[5398.28s -> 5411.88s]  Robot. How big is it? Oh my god. I was thinking it was going to be a little toy. Well, they just
[5411.88s -> 5421.93s]  gave it to us. We have to see how it works. All right. Grip. Left, right. Okay. Grip either hand
[5421.93s -> 5428.78s]  to use. Well, how do I? Is it just lit right now? What determines how this explodes?
[5435.67s -> 5446.58s]  Whoa. It goes into slow motion. Holy shit. Oh my god. Are you kidding me? Is this going to fly at
[5446.58s -> 5470.14s]  me? What happened to slow motion last? Wow. It's still in slow motion. Can I touch it? It's still
[5470.14s -> 5483.56s]  in slow motion. It's super hot. Super hot. I think I can hold on. Movement speed. Interface.
[5484.81s -> 5499.82s]  Graphics quality. Bomb slow motion speed. Should we just do like 80%? 60, 70%? 60, 58, whatever?
[5502.73s -> 5511.94s]  It was still in slow motion. It is really cool, but you kind of have to sit here. How long does
[5511.94s -> 5543.80s]  this last clock on the main menu time? Is it done? Let's throw another one. Okay. How many
[5559.03s -> 5566.68s]  This is crazy. All right. Let me. Let's start over. How many parts are there? There's only 24
[5566.68s -> 5573.24s]  parts. That's nothing. Maybe I can just do it all with this. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Throw it.
[5573.24s -> 5615.43s]  Get it and throw it. Okay. No. Here. Eat this scumbag. I think I did it. That's it.
[5617.83s -> 5626.87s]  So, uh, I think using the bombs is cheating because you don't get a time.
[5631.61s -> 5644.10s]  So, no, that's just for fun. That doesn't count. Did it actually count though? See? That didn't
[5644.10s -> 5663.80s]  count. We're going to do it legit. See, look at this. Ready? I had no timer. See? Look at that.
[5669.46s -> 5673.37s]  All right. Let's just get, let's get this done the right way. Is he going to fall on me?
[5675.06s -> 5698.38s]  No. Watch it. Okay. Come on. Get the other side.
[5701.10s -> 5717.77s]  This is a real lip biter. Take his heart out. Oh man. What am I doing with them? Oh, shit.
[5720.92s -> 5735.06s]  Let's get the head off. Anything else with the head? No. What do I need? 21 more parts. Shoulders
[5735.06s -> 5753.50s]  come off. Oh my God. That's so cool. No, no, no. How dare you? I was using this as a weapon.
[5763.11s -> 5765.21s]  What? None of that came off?
[5766.17s -> 5780.49s]  I don't know. This is like his other shoulder.
[5782.25s -> 5785.77s]  Oh, Jesus. I have his whole body. All right. We're going for a breakup here.
[5791.70s -> 5819.88s]  I can't see. No, don't open the window. Oh, give me this. Ah, this is what it's like to be Superman.
[5824.71s -> 5826.71s]  I could go with some more sound effects besides.
[5827.19s -> 5847.61s]  Yeah. We got 16 more parts. It's like a little. No, what the hell would it be? Here? Is this all
[5847.61s -> 5856.84s]  one piece? I think that's all one piece. That's the torso. I don't think these come off.
[5860.76s -> 5881.26s]  I don't think so. I think that's one piece. The arms on the other hand. Yeah. Okay. Looking good.
[5881.98s -> 5889.80s]  Any more pieces that are attached here? I think it's just the knuckle. Maybe the fingers.
[5892.47s -> 5901.22s]  I think that's the way. Did these come off? See if I can get a hand off. Yeah, of course.
[5905.11s -> 5906.39s]  Yeah, the whole hand comes apart.
[5910.68s -> 5935.86s]  That's that. Okay. Get it on this one. How many more? Eight. That's it. Okay. Six. What am I
[5935.86s -> 5946.33s]  missing here? Maybe something with these. Oh, definitely. This wheel comes off. Absolutely.
[5947.29s -> 5954.81s]  The other arm up there. Maybe. Yeah, I think that thing comes off.
[5961.02s -> 5984.06s]  I'm getting too into it. I think I broke it. Are we good? We're good. I'm getting too immersed.
[5984.62s -> 6004.65s]  How many more? Three pieces. There's only two more pieces. Where are they? Bring out the tool.
[6004.65s -> 6032.82s]  You know the one. Straight ahead. Where was it? Oh, shit. Okay. It's this thing? What is connected
[6032.82s -> 6046.17s]  to here? Ah, all right. Then there's one more piece on the main body. This little piece? This
[6046.17s -> 6087.13s]  little chest piece? No. Where is it? I have no idea. It's not it. Thank you. I've been biting
[6087.13s -> 6095.99s]  my lip more. I do the shit. I like, I just have chew on my mouth when I'm just concentrating on
[6095.99s -> 6107.72s]  something. That's interesting. Why do I get guns? All right, so we got it. Crack is safe.
[6108.60s -> 6143.58s]  What if I just know the code? Let's try code. This is probably a code. Crack is safe. It's not,
[6143.58s -> 6150.73s]  and let's just paint it on there. 7331. I would probably advise against putting the code of your
[6150.73s -> 6176.66s]  safe on the safe. Otherwise, somebody can just do that. Does it open? Gold bars in here. What is it?
[6176.66s -> 6190.09s]  Gold. 999. One kilogram. This is like 50 grand. A kilogram of gold is like 50 to 60 thousand dollars.
[6190.09s -> 6216.04s]  Is it not? All right. Okay. I got the gold. Wait, that's it. Oh, no, it's not. Can I get out now?
[6216.04s -> 6225.75s]  Am I locked in forever? All right. All right. I got a piece out.
[6241.50s -> 6245.48s]  All right. Let's see systematically how we take this out. There's a lot of parts, apparently.
[6252.52s -> 6271.69s]  Yeah. All right. I've ripped it off. Can I get the sides? What about the top? It's 39 parts.
[6271.69s -> 6302.49s]  39? How much more is in here? Flip this around, maybe. Oh, Jesus. All right. Well,
[6302.57s -> 6312.54s]  oh, God damn it. I hate my rooms. I rent out an ice skating rink and pave over it and have to be
[6312.54s -> 6330.33s]  my personal VR room. Where do I put this? Hole in the wall. All right. So now I get to, this is
[6330.33s -> 6336.26s]  where all the parts come from. Let's go ahead and get something, some finesse here. Let's go with a
[6336.26s -> 6373.30s]  wrench. No. Take out all the slugs. Nice. There that goes. Is it still plugged in? They're disappearing.
[6381.75s -> 6394.06s]  No, no, no, no. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Ruined. Can someone tell me if this
[6394.06s -> 6408.79s]  streamer is popular? What? What do you mean? Can somebody tell me if he's popular? I don't know.
[6411.83s -> 6424.97s]  That's kind of an odd question. Oh, that felt good. That felt really good.
[6426.01s -> 6450.84s]  Okay. I think, wait. Nice. This is just satisfying the video game. What do we got? 11 parts.
[6451.48s -> 6462.49s]  I wonder if it's part 11. I can't pick this up. It's got to have to do with this, right?
[6465.16s -> 6472.01s]  Cares if he is funny and nice. That's it. Well, thank you. That's really, really nice thing to say.
[6473.78s -> 6486.82s]  Thank you. Oh, it's every individual button. It looks like fuck with our roommate. You know what
[6486.82s -> 6506.90s]  I mean? W A S D. W A S D, huh? Now it says like dickhead. What do you call that? Did I win? Oh,
[6506.90s -> 6525.19s]  I won. All right. I won. That was fun. What's coming up next? Bicycle chair. Okay. I don't,
[6525.19s -> 6530.71s]  this one, I don't know about that one. That one seems like it's a train, an elevator,
[6532.74s -> 6540.23s]  a real car, the Titanic. How am I supposed to take apart the Titanic with a screwdriver?
[6545.30s -> 6553.64s]  Cool. Do the, I mean, I'm gonna do, I'm, this is disassembly stream guys. This is, I'm having a
[6553.64s -> 6595.88s]  blast. This is just fun to play. Can I sit on it? I can't do it. Oh, that's so much fun. All right,
[6595.88s -> 6612.38s]  set it back up. The need training with, oh, you can actually do it. Hold on. Oh shit. No, don't do
[6612.38s -> 6624.33s]  it. The bully from the Disney movie. Come on. Get out of my way, Walt. I gotta do this. No,
[6624.33s -> 6639.50s]  it won't stand up. I can't do it. You know what I'm doing though. Dude, you know, you know,
[6639.50s -> 6646.95s]  anybody ever turn their bike upside down like this and try to like make like soup and shit and
[6646.95s -> 6651.27s]  fuck with your candy? I used to take my candy bars and like grind them. So I have like chocolate
[6651.27s -> 6661.50s]  wheels. Somebody would just be there going, and you would just hold something there and like,
[6662.30s -> 6668.58s]  like a sander. You won't put your face on it. You won't put your face on it. I'm not gonna put
[6668.58s -> 6673.38s]  my face on it, stupid. You know, I'll do it. And then they like kept like a fat lip for the next
[6673.38s -> 6689.77s]  like three or four days. Nobody did that. Nobody like did this and then put their face on it.
[6689.77s -> 6697.38s]  Don't do that. It's a bad thing. All right, let's take this part. Now I want to stand it back up
[6697.38s -> 6706.52s]  again. Nobody. No, I'm talking, look, I'm talking about setting it up like this and spinning this
[6706.52s -> 6711.48s]  and like going like this. And some, one of your weirdo neighborhood friends does that and like,
[6712.44s -> 6721.69s]  it was a dumb thing to do and you should never do it. I do not condone it. I did it. It sucked.
[6721.69s -> 6742.90s]  Don't do it. All right, how do I get this apart? How do I get, let's go here. What? Oh, I just got
[6742.90s -> 6768.71s]  a five controller. A wrench? All right, wrench. Come here. Come here. Come here. Ah, shit. Pliers.
[6769.35s -> 6814.63s]  I don't have pliers. Fuck. Oh, come on. Really? Come on. Come on. Thank you. Oh, that's not it.
[6814.79s -> 6822.46s]  Except for that one. Oh, I got like a hair all over my face. Let's get back in. Oh, let me take this
[6822.46s -> 6853.56s]  off so nobody have like a drink of water. Come on. You won't do it. Kim check. All right. There ain't
[6853.56s -> 6863.16s]  anybody in here. I want to get some more water in a second after I do this level. Is this the right
[6863.16s -> 6884.01s]  side? Yes, it is. Ceiling? I have to tape bells to the door. That's fucking hilarious. Wait. Oh,
[6884.01s -> 6900.09s]  come on. Why is it, there's like a stain on here now. Fucking bird box. Turn on music. Ah, but,
[6900.09s -> 6904.68s]  however, I'm gonna have to take this. Let me take my first break. Let me go refill my water
[6905.32s -> 6908.12s]  and I'll come back. We'll put it on like a playlist or something. I'll be right back.
[7113.82s -> 7126.01s]  Okay. Hello. Let's go back in this and take apart bike. You want to sip my fresh water?
[7126.73s -> 7137.29s]  She's, she's not in there. All right. Let's get a, let's get like a, I don't know, like a Monster
[7137.29s -> 7143.66s]  Rancher. Somebody's Monster Rancher 2 OST. Hopefully I can actually play through these speakers.
[7148.94s -> 7161.74s]  Um, Monster Rancher 2 OST. I think it's like eight minutes. Put on doom again. How, how it's made.
[7169.51s -> 7193.08s]  Like, how it's made theme song for one hour. No, no, how it's made background music. Hold on. How
[7193.08s -> 7201.70s]  loud is this going to be in my headset? This is an hour long. This is going to drive me insane.
[7204.98s -> 7222.33s]  How it's unmade. Then he takes the wrench and moves it down over the hole. Two workers come out
[7222.33s -> 7232.58s]  and hold either side of the glass. An assembly line and hard workers. That's what it takes to
[7232.58s -> 7249.91s]  undo a bicycle. Two tires are replaced with air filled tires. This is so loud though. Hold on.
[7257.96s -> 7273.22s]  Uh, this is too, this is too, the OST is banger. I love this show too. I'm not shitting on it.
[7273.22s -> 7282.94s]  That show's amazing. Okay. How do I get this to play softer in my ears? Probably like that.
[7283.96s -> 7332.87s]  Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Where are my hands? The person grabs the bike with their bare hands.
[7335.21s -> 7349.21s]  A skilled worker undoes the handlebars with an Allen wrench. Two workers then hold the bike
[7349.21s -> 7358.41s]  upside down and a third worker presses his face into the tire to make sure for a perfect face burn.
[7389.24s -> 7399.96s]  Did we get like frame rate here? What's going on with this?
[7416.57s -> 7475.46s]  God damn it. Got it. No, no, no. I get it. Is it getting faster? I feel like it's getting pitched
[7475.46s -> 7531.58s]  up. My game's breaking. I don't know how to take apart a bike. Got it. Pick it up.
[7531.58s -> 7563.19s]  Uh, other side. All right. Get in there. This is going to come out. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait,
[7563.19s -> 7582.38s]  wait. This song is going to fucking drive me crazy. It is getting faster. The pitch is going up.
[7591.21s -> 7626.23s]  What? Shit. I'm going to hit you back. I'm going to lose my mind.
[7627.19s -> 7652.58s]  No. All right. I'm almost done. I got to get that off.
[7687.75s -> 7714.12s]  No way. Almost got it. Get it. Take it off. No, don't do that Joe. That's not going to lock.
[7714.12s -> 7798.70s]  Is it over? Of course not. I got it. I got it. I got it. All right. Get that out. Oh yeah. Why?
[7798.70s -> 7898.17s]  How many more pieces? 45. I can't take that anymore. That's too much. Uranium is a metallic
[7898.17s -> 7904.09s]  element that was discovered by a German chemist in 1789. The significance of this discovery
[7904.09s -> 7910.97s]  wasn't understood for a century and a half. In 1938, scientists figured out that uranium atoms
[7910.97s -> 7921.18s]  could be split to produce energy. The size of a fireplace log, this nuclear fuel bundle
[7921.18s -> 7927.10s]  generates a lot more heat. It's packed with enough uranium to power 100 homes for a year.
[7928.38s -> 7935.56s]  To obtain the uranium, they tunnel 1,640 feet underground at this site in northern Saskatchewan.
[7936.52s -> 7940.12s]  This mine is the largest source of high-grade uranium in the world.
[7941.08s -> 7945.85s]  Lies beneath a bed of water-saturated sandstone.
[7947.45s -> 7951.37s]  To reach it, they use drill bits studded with tungsten carbide buttons.
[7952.01s -> 7955.85s]  Like knuckles on a fist, the button bits punch into the rock face.
[7957.13s -> 7969.75s]  Burst holes are for pipes that will hold heat out of the ground and squeeze it around the ore.
[7969.75s -> 7973.75s]  It transfers a new piece of pipe to the end of the drill roughly every five feet.
[7974.71s -> 7977.91s]  To penetrate 426 feet into the sandstone bed,
[7979.75s -> 7985.11s]  it takes up to eight days to install just one length of pipe. There are 200 of them.
[7985.83s -> 7992.76s]  Workers configure the pipes so they surround the ore deposit. These freeze pipes will stabilize
[7992.76s -> 7999.16s]  the ground and also turn high pressure groundwater to ice so it won't interfere with the actual mining.
[8000.12s -> 8008.12s]  Freeze plant above ground chills calcium fluoride brine to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit
[8008.12s -> 8014.38s]  and sends it through the freeze pipes. It absorbs heat as it freezes the ground
[8014.38s -> 8016.62s]  and loops back to be chilled. All right. All right. I'm done.
[8021.86s -> 8026.52s]  Let's get something relaxing for crying out loud.
[8030.50s -> 8033.38s]  We're learning. Don't do that. We're learning.
[8034.90s -> 8043.11s]  Oh, listen to the fox and screams. No, no, no, I'm not doing that. I was learning.
[8043.11s -> 8062.70s]  Well, not learning today. Earthbound OST. That's not bad. Okay. That's the first
[8068.15s -> 8091.03s]  too loud. Okay. That's at a reasonable level. Earthbound.
[8091.03s -> 8103.11s]  I'm going to get this fucking bike disassembled. Oh my God.
[8104.23s -> 8108.47s]  We've got a house coming up too. We'll put on some heavy fucking metal.
[8108.71s -> 8122.92s]  I'm going to tear that house down with a sledgehammer. This is better. Okay. This
[8122.92s -> 8159.98s]  is relaxing. It's good. High quality sound. Yeah, that's good. Good. Allen wrench screwdriver.
[8159.98s -> 8203.00s]  We'll get it. What? Get it. Huh? I back to one. Okay. Oh, why? I've done every tool.
[8216.15s -> 8245.46s]  Every tool. Oh, all right. That's good. Oh my God. I've hit more walls today. Jesus. I need a bigger
[8245.46s -> 8261.58s]  fucking room or I have to do like seated play. How do I disconnect that? Here we go. Please dad.
[8261.58s -> 8275.40s]  Can we learn again? No. Everything you need to know, I can tell you. You don't need all fancy
[8275.40s -> 8298.20s]  books. I can tell you what you need to know. Here goes the chain. Whoa. All right. Now we get it.
[8298.20s -> 8313.75s]  It's done. What's left? What do we got left? The bike, this part of the bike, right? It has to be.
[8314.31s -> 8352.57s]  Crowbar. There it is. Perfect. How do I get that off? Can I even get in there? I just barely
[8352.57s -> 8365.02s]  could get in there. All right. 14 more pieces. Jesus. Okay. This part of the bike. You know,
[8365.02s -> 8375.38s]  this is all fucked up. Okay. This right here. Can I stay still? Stay still. Stop moving.
[8388.78s -> 8411.85s]  All right. Now what else is there? I've done so much. 11 pieces. This thing. Okay. That works.
[8419.05s -> 8438.01s]  Good. Does this come off? I don't think so. This comes off, right? Yep. Dive to bike wheel. I did
[8438.01s -> 8458.23s]  not die to bike wheel. Four pieces left. I don't know. Something got a loose screw in it somewhere.
[8466.49s -> 8486.78s]  No. Fuck. These things. I don't think so. Big wow. Well, we're gonna have to pull this out.
[8487.42s -> 8518.79s]  Oh, this thing. Oh, fuck. It is this thing. All right. Is there another one? There's another
[8518.79s -> 8552.65s]  one of these somewhere, right? Got it. Last thing is this has to be this. No. 33 minutes.
[8554.39s -> 8570.57s]  Handgun has been unlocked. Handgun is unlocked. That's right. Finally. Safe. Bicycle. Chair.
[8570.57s -> 8578.50s]  Water heater. And then house. We're almost there. This is gonna be easy. I don't know. It's not 62
[8578.50s -> 8599.34s]  pieces. 62 pieces? Are you kidding me? Let's go up on top. I gotta be more careful about this stuff.
[8600.14s -> 8611.86s]  All right. I'm ready. Let's go with handles. I think I can take this. This is the pillow.
[8612.82s -> 8625.19s]  Everything that's not naked goes over there. Anything else loose? So we gotta get under here.
[8626.31s -> 8635.42s]  All right. This is not. I don't want. I want. I don't. I got the other one. I want to keep standing.
[8635.42s -> 8643.45s]  You know what I mean? Look at this. I already got you. I'm already fucking halfway in front of you.
[8674.52s -> 8684.52s]  Hell yeah. We can't do it like that. It's illegal. It's against the law.
[8685.24s -> 8702.07s]  It's against the laws of the video game. Scarily effective. No, I'm just. The fucking door.
[8702.07s -> 8719.54s]  I just door knocked the streamer meme to myself. Jesus Christ. No, don't break.
[8720.18s -> 8757.10s]  Hold on. Do it one at a time. These are elaborate. Get them all in front of me.
[8757.66s -> 8781.82s]  Do it smart. You know what I mean? Why fuck the whole thing up? God damn it. I did it again. He
[8781.82s -> 8798.73s]  did it again. He did it again. He did it again. Move out of the way for a minute. Where am I?
[8799.29s -> 8809.77s]  Where am I? He's going mental. I got a I got a booger inside my nose and I can't get it.
[8811.05s -> 8816.01s]  You know, you know, seriously, like valve or the HTC. Cut this up a little bit so I can like put
[8816.01s -> 8828.15s]  my hand in my nose. I can't do it right now. Am I in a decent spot? I think. All right. Keep it going.
[8828.15s -> 8848.18s]  This is the way you're supposed to do this shit. All right. You ready? Check it out. Wrong tool.
[8848.18s -> 8867.34s]  Wrong tool. He's just he's just surgical with this. Turn around. You got a good sear on one side.
[8868.14s -> 8871.50s]  You don't want to cook them too long. If you cook them too long, you want to go to a medium well.
[8871.50s -> 8888.49s]  You don't want to go over a medium well. I think these are done. I'm cleaning my workstation.
[8907.93s -> 8921.34s]  Come to me. What do we got? What's next? Looks like this guy right here. This is the spring.
[8921.34s -> 8935.67s]  Nothing in there. There goes the spring. All right. Easy. All right. Hold on.
[8935.67s -> 8946.86s]  Can take that up. Turn around to the other side. Nothing else on this side. Are you sure?
[8960.54s -> 8977.64s]  Get the other side too. Oh shit. Okay. That worked. How am I going to take apart a whole house?
[8979.29s -> 9002.42s]  That's going to be impossible. Oh shit. Okay. We got it. Good. Great. Get the paper out of here.
[9002.98s -> 9023.56s]  Now what's next? These. I really got to get under here, don't I? Look at this shit. One arm.
[9023.56s -> 9031.83s]  This whole thing's going to hit me in the head, isn't it? This is some America's Funniest Home
[9031.83s -> 9046.73s]  Video shit. Okay. What's left? It's the only sound. I'm getting good at this.
[9047.53s -> 9059.10s]  This is still connected by something. What is it connected by? What is this connected to?
[9060.62s -> 9097.18s]  A crowbar? I don't see anything that's connected to. Oh fuck. Give me the pliers. There it goes.
[9098.30s -> 9109.77s]  All right. What do we got here? This should come off cleanly now. Got it. The bike took a long time.
[9109.77s -> 9117.42s]  I don't know why. Well, I'm from. I'm hyping myself up. We've got one more and then we have
[9117.42s -> 9125.94s]  the house to do. So I got to be ready. I got to do my stretches. What do we got?
[9126.02s -> 9141.75s]  Yeah. Water heater and then house. Does it work? Can I actually turn it on?
[9143.64s -> 9178.60s]  That's so huge. 104. What? Oh fuck. You might as well take care of this first.
[9179.32s -> 9190.58s]  All right. How do I get the panel off? Just with my hands? No, no, no, no. I didn't want this.
[9192.36s -> 9237.83s]  I don't want this. I don't want this. Oh my God. Why? Just stay over there. I don't. All right.
[9237.83s -> 9252.65s]  Turn this off. Thank you. How do I get the panel off? Shut up over there. Will you?
[9252.65s -> 9296.20s]  Can I wedge the panel off? I don't know how to get this off. No, no gun. No gun. Look at that.
[9297.64s -> 9314.62s]  Right there. What the fuck? There we go. There we go. This is cool. All right. Leave that there
[9314.62s -> 9323.00s]  for now. So this is what a water pump looks like. Hold on. Can I turn it on? I want to see
[9323.00s -> 9343.96s]  where the water comes from. Press this button. I can see right here. This is cool. This is the
[9343.96s -> 9371.62s]  circuit breaker. Such precision. Just get all the screws out. All right. Hold on. Screw hanging
[9371.62s -> 9393.59s]  on up here. Tool. Okay. I got that. Hold on. Anymore? Right here. I can take it off a wall.
[9393.59s -> 9404.87s]  Oh fuck. You're right. Look at you. Look at how smart you are. Actually, no. I don't think I can
[9404.87s -> 9435.80s]  do that right this second. Really? It's right there. Oh, all right. I'm going down here. I'll
[9435.80s -> 9460.79s]  see you guys in a minute. I feel like this is the kind of shit that's on Sesame Street
[9460.79s -> 9483.13s]  with the song playing here. Don't you? This is like, this was an episode. I got to cut wires.
[9483.69s -> 9504.46s]  What was that? The grill. The circuit board was an Xbox 360 heatsink. Look at these tiny little
[9504.46s -> 9517.70s]  things. My goodness. It's so tiny. Oh my God. I got to turn it around. Look at down here. I'm
[9517.70s -> 9541.46s]  going to get the screwdriver out. Easy. Whoa. That's the reactor. That's the nuclear reactor.
[9544.68s -> 9560.78s]  Look at this. Whoa. Whoa. Are you kidding me? Look at this detail. How many more parts? 40 still.
[9567.30s -> 9599.50s]  Hmm. Pliers? I'm going to say pliers. What is the other part? All right. Got it.
[9599.50s -> 9620.65s]  There's the band. Come on. Come on. Very interesting. Okay. Now I think I can get rid of this.
[9620.65s -> 9634.31s]  Yep. Nothing holding this together. I feel like there's another thing getting held down here.
[9643.08s -> 9659.29s]  Yes. Yes. Nothing in that one. This is where the water comes from. What is that? Is that a bug?
[9659.29s -> 9685.61s]  What is this? Oh, that was weird. Come on. Get it open. Come on. What? What tool do I need to get
[9685.61s -> 9714.47s]  that off? You think it was pliers? Is it not pliers? Time to fight. Oh, shit. Missed. Minus 20 HP.
[9715.35s -> 9733.59s]  Hector uses PK dart. Not effective. Oh, Hector uses dart again. PK dart. Very effective. He's
[9733.59s -> 9764.44s]  almost dead. PK up. PK dart. I don't know. PK. PK call the police. Didn't work. PK crowbar. That's
[9764.44s -> 9781.24s]  a win. PK. PK gun. PK gun. No, no, no. That'll fuck this up. That'll, yeah. No, no. Let's get
[9781.24s -> 9787.93s]  back to what we were doing. Stop distracting me. You're distracting me. Wait, am I looking the
[9787.93s -> 9812.87s]  right way? It's this one. It's PK dart. Sorry. He's lost it. He's lost his mind. Oh, my God. I got
[9812.87s -> 9856.55s]  to get in so close. Look at this. What? Ah, nice. Looks like just shake it out. Same deal over here.
[9858.47s -> 9873.45s]  Here it is. So then I can pick this up again and shake it out. Now what? I can't get this one off.
[9874.17s -> 9892.95s]  You know what I mean? I can't get this one off. How do I get this off? Ah, there's a screw there.
[9903.18s -> 9927.30s]  Now I can get this all off. Bingo. Bingo. Done. Two more parts. There's so much shit on the ground.
[9928.02s -> 9950.52s]  The button on the front? Oh, right. Over here. Done. That was cool. There's a lot of little
[9950.52s -> 9962.39s]  intricate parts. All right. Uh, the time has come to see what the house is. And you know what that
[9962.39s -> 9973.61s]  means? It's time to put on like the hardest fucking song I could find. But I want to bring the house
[9973.61s -> 9986.10s]  down. What is like an extreme like blast your eardrums out song? Not the full house theme.
[9986.10s -> 10012.74s]  So I'm thinking something different through the fire and flames. This is pretty hard play.
[10012.74s -> 10019.38s]  Just keep using this one. No, not this one. I'll get fine. We're going to do we're going to pull
[10019.38s -> 10038.01s]  this back. I'm going to do doom OST 2016 because I mean it's been a while. This is loud and fucking
[10038.01s -> 10050.49s]  crazy. So here we go. See you guys soon. I'm going to I'm going to thrash the fuck around right now.
[10051.58s -> 10052.70s]  Get ready. It's going to be loud.
[10160.60s -> 10168.84s]  That was so easy. You didn't even try to have this host in. They built an entire house without any
[10168.84s -> 10173.56s]  cement, without any brick, without anything. Nothing to hold it together. They just stuck it
[10173.56s -> 10312.49s]  together like a house of cards. Yeah. The precision. What's left, huh? Get the fuck out of here.
[10312.49s -> 10362.70s]  Oh, I don't think I can do it anymore. I really hurt myself here. I haven't broken the thousand
[10362.70s -> 10418.98s]  back. I am the champion. No, no spill. I'm going to go take, I'm going to be right back.
[10418.98s -> 10427.91s]  I just use like six days or the energy. I'm going to get my water refill.
[10428.47s -> 10440.22s]  That was fucking intense. Why would a house fall down that easily? This game is fucking mental. I
[10440.22s -> 10585.99s]  love it. I'll be right back. All right. Hi. Let me uh, I've got to untangle this cord. It's
[10585.99s -> 10595.74s]  kind of all over the place. Kim, check Kim's downstairs. I just saw, just said hello.
[10595.74s -> 10606.54s]  Let me untangle you. Is my hand okay? It's all right. It's a little red, but it'll be fine.
[10607.74s -> 10625.46s]  It was the controller took the brunt of that below. Let's put this back in. What do I have
[10625.46s -> 10641.75s]  left to destroy? I need to moisturize. I'm going to do more than that. I got to shave tonight.
[10647.61s -> 10656.70s]  The Titanic, that's going to take all day. What a fun game though. Holy shit. I did not expect this
[10656.70s -> 10662.79s]  to be this fun. I feel like this is kind of an overlooked VR gem. If I'm going to be honest
[10662.79s -> 10672.34s]  with you, it looks pretty, I'd give it a solid, uh, they give it a solid B plus right now.
[10673.06s -> 10688.25s]  All right. Let's get back in. Thanks for being honest. Yeah. It's an, I can't pretend you guys
[10688.25s -> 10697.27s]  have seen me try. I'm not going to give you bullshit. Games is 79. I mean, it wasn't B plus.
[10697.27s -> 10708.17s]  That's an 80, 88. Oh, my head's gonna fall. Stop wearing it. Like it's a fun hat. I,
[10709.85s -> 10726.22s]  okay. This is how greasy my head is right now. Is this the right? Let's get this back on.
[10729.26s -> 10741.06s]  Use the neck strap. If there was such a thing, just use your grease to moisturize. Uh, you want
[10741.06s -> 10747.00s]  me to have like, you want me to break out tomorrow? Here we go. Let's finish this one.
[10748.82s -> 10765.62s]  No more doom. No more music. I got to focus. Okay. It doesn't. Get that in there. I've been
[10765.62s -> 10770.58s]  playing this game for three hours. Holy shit. Oh, it's been worth it. It's been fun. All right.
[10770.58s -> 10781.11s]  What's the, what do I, what's the final count here? There's 27 more parts. How the fuck am I
[10781.11s -> 10799.88s]  going to find that? I mean, like this, does this count? What? Am I frozen? Am I frozen in time?
[10799.88s -> 10809.96s]  Is this like a Quicksilver moment? Should I run around and feed the dog pizza? I think it's the
[10809.96s -> 10821.43s]  foundation. It's down here. If I could have time in a bar room, the first thing that I would do
[10821.43s -> 10843.83s]  is run around and feed it on pizza. This is a lot of the doom. I have to slide it all the way down.
[10847.74s -> 10858.09s]  Is it the floor? No, it's not the floor. It's all the windows. Let's check. 12.
[10859.66s -> 10867.48s]  And I didn't even use a gun. You understand? I didn't even use a gun. I did this all with my
[10867.48s -> 10871.80s]  bare hands and a little, a little help with one of my friends, you know? A little help with a couple
[10871.80s -> 10898.06s]  of my friends. Okay. Nine. Well, this is eight. Seven. Seven. Six. Something's going to be buried
[10898.06s -> 10926.84s]  underneath. Oh boy. This is bad. I need the tool. Oh God. Right here. Right here. Four more parts.
[10927.56s -> 10949.50s]  And I did with my bare hands. Right here. This is where the stove was. Right here. I'm surprised
[10949.50s -> 10956.01s]  that this is not dropping down to like 10 frames a second. That's even in a game, a game that has
[10956.01s -> 10961.54s]  this much physics and shit in it, random pieces. Don't, wouldn't you expect this to be running at
[10961.54s -> 10977.88s]  10 frames a second right now? Two more. So one. That's it. One more. Where is it? Is it the thing
[10977.88s -> 10998.94s]  in the sky? I think it's floating in the sky right here, but can I not grab it? That time is inflated
[10998.94s -> 11008.02s]  because I had to take a break. How is this going? Okay. I want to, I want to, I just want to go
[11008.02s -> 11019.24s]  inside the house if I can. We need to go inside. That's too interesting to not just look at it at
[11019.24s -> 11036.68s]  least once. All right. Here we go. Let's like walk in. All right. It's an actual house.
[11038.95s -> 11046.17s]  All right. As you can see, no, no, no. Back it up. Back it up. Realtor. Realtor bit. Here we go. Three, two.
[11048.25s -> 11052.65s]  So as you see, property is very, very well maintained. Very well taken care of.
[11052.65s -> 11057.05s]  Sort of has that colonial vibe to it. A little bit of a step up. You just get the foundation
[11057.05s -> 11061.21s]  happens here. The foundation goes up a little bit. You get your second floor, which is your master.
[11062.25s -> 11068.34s]  Yeah. Your master and your master bathroom is up there. And in here we've got the bathroom.
[11068.74s -> 11073.86s]  A little kid's playroom over here, as you can see. Pretty, you know, that's standard carpet,
[11073.86s -> 11078.90s]  nothing. You can take it up if you want. This is all marble, by the way. A little walk-in closet
[11078.90s -> 11084.02s]  for, you know, for you guys to store your jackets. And in here is one of my favorite parts of the
[11084.02s -> 11093.14s]  house. In here is the backdrop out of the backyard. Yep. You don't have a huge backyard, but look,
[11093.14s -> 11096.98s]  you got a place for a grill and entertaining and having your friends come over.
[11097.14s -> 11102.26s]  Oh yeah, it's beautiful. You want to see upstairs? Yeah, we can see upstairs. I just kind of,
[11102.26s -> 11109.83s]  it's a big house. Yeah, let's take a look up here, as you see. Neighborhood's great. Schools are
[11109.83s -> 11117.51s]  great. Watch your step, though. It's a little slippery, but it's just clean. Yeah. Really?
[11117.51s -> 11129.78s]  Wow. I'm surprised they have that work here. That's a great job. Balcony out here, as you see.
[11130.18s -> 11135.46s]  As you see, beautiful, beautiful landscape out here in front of you. You've got a lot of plotted
[11135.46s -> 11140.18s]  land. This is not owned by anything. You could take your dog and your kid out there and your
[11140.18s -> 11143.86s]  kids can all just run around out there. You can get a whole baseball team out there.
[11146.82s -> 11152.82s]  Yeah. So, price, right? We're talking about price. As you know, property like this is not
[11152.82s -> 11158.42s]  necessarily cheap. We are in, like I said, a very beautiful area. Watch out coming down.
[11159.38s -> 11163.35s]  So, I mean, the thing is, they're looking, what they're looking for
[11164.15s -> 11170.31s]  is they're looking, look, they're looking for, they're looking for $29,000. Oh, Jesus Christ.
[11170.31s -> 11181.34s]  What? Get down! Why? Get out, quick!
[11181.90s -> 11185.53s]  It's driving!
[11191.69s -> 11198.62s]  And scene. Cap that one. Cap that one right there. Cap it. $29,000. I wonder why.
[11206.36s -> 11210.42s]  There it is. Share that one with your friends and title it,
[11210.42s -> 11226.34s]  Hilarious Realtor Moment. All right, let's go. God, that's going to happen in my own place.
[11227.22s -> 11240.41s]  All right, what's next? A hard drive. This would be easy. I'm tangling up again. God damn it.
[11242.04s -> 11255.27s]  Damn it. Whatever. This one will be fun. You guys like computers. Let me show you how to
[11255.27s -> 11270.10s]  destroy a hard drive, guys. It's pretty simple. I didn't even destroy it. I didn't get the most
[11270.10s -> 11306.33s]  important part. Never mind. This is actually interesting. I don't know what it looks like
[11306.33s -> 11312.60s]  in here. The only thing I know about a hard drive is it's a brick. It's just a cube that
[11312.60s -> 11318.38s]  stores data. I don't know how. I think there's another computer in here, right? I know how a
[11318.38s -> 11326.57s]  hard drive works. It's a hard disk. It's magnetic. I'm not stupid. I'm not going to let you use that
[11326.57s -> 11332.47s]  one to fucking hurt me. You know what I mean? Can't get it with that one. Why not? What the
[11332.47s -> 11364.60s]  fuck are you talking about? All right, you got to use the pen tool. Wow. So it's a record player.
[11364.60s -> 11401.99s]  That's what it looks like in there. It's a record player. It's so tiny.
[11402.31s -> 11415.29s]  What did I get? That's it? What? What's up?
[11424.28s -> 11431.50s]  Gas tank. How do you think it operates, guys? Oh, whoa. I need to get some. Let's just like
[11431.50s -> 11439.40s]  put you guys over here. Sit down and relax for these. I got to get them. You know what?
[11439.40s -> 11459.43s]  You're right. I can check on them. I'm like standing too much. Whoa. It's made out of gold.
[11482.49s -> 11483.77s]  See you guys in the next video.
[11492.44s -> 11522.52s]  Flip it around. Well, that's the part right here. What is that? Ah, screwdriver. No,
[11522.52s -> 11530.84s]  not screwdriver. What? I had the right tool. The little baby screwdriver. The little baby one.
[11530.84s -> 11553.00s]  Oh, cool. That's what it was though. The vane.
[11563.56s -> 11570.36s]  Come on. I got to get that off. Got it? Let's hold this on.
[11574.46s -> 11579.88s]  Can you just break stuff? Yeah, I could like probably whip it against the wall,
[11579.88s -> 11588.18s]  but then I'll lose the parts and I won't know where to go. What do I need here? A wrench or
[11588.18s -> 11622.50s]  something? How do I get this off? I don't think it's the crowbar. Whoa. Holy shit. It was the
[11622.50s -> 11656.73s]  crowbar. No, it wasn't. I can't grab that. Come on. Get in there. What? Oh, screws. Three more
[11656.73s -> 11665.21s]  parts left. Well, this obviously. What's this being held on by? Someone's still grabbing this
[11665.21s -> 11681.75s]  right here. No, it was still holding on to that. There's something. Ah, there's still a screw in
[11681.75s -> 11694.84s]  here. Don't drop this. Don't drop this. It's fucking. One more part. This cord is going all
[11694.84s -> 11706.71s]  the way up. You know the word. This thing right here. Bring out the beeper.
[11725.69s -> 11737.35s]  Oh, right there. I did it. That's it. Okay. Nice. All right. Well, I think we're coming up on a
[11737.35s -> 11750.87s]  blender, I think. I have to. I gotta. This is so tangled up. Hold on. I gotta undo this.
[11752.47s -> 11755.99s]  I'm gonna make it so you don't see this because it'll hurt your eyes.
[11758.01s -> 11767.11s]  So let me just. I wish that was like a detangler profile. See, it ends up bunched up like this.
[11767.11s -> 11778.97s]  No, you can't see me. Never mind. Wait, I. Sorry. You see, it goes like this and gets
[11779.05s -> 11787.61s]  taut around so much. It's hard to take care of. I need to stand up on my table.
[11789.90s -> 11797.45s]  Really wring it out. All right, let's wring it out here. Get the suspension wires off Amazon.
[11797.45s -> 11800.65s]  Yeah, but I don't know if I can put the. I don't have like a drop ceiling. Don't you need a drop
[11800.65s -> 11805.69s]  ceiling to do that? Or does it? Can you actually get something to stick on the ceiling? I think
[11805.69s -> 11829.18s]  we could fall off and get hurt. That's better. Bring it back. Cable sleeves. I wonder if the
[11829.18s -> 11846.86s]  cable sleeves would have just bunched up too. Let's see. Did I stream this in VR for like six
[11846.86s -> 11862.55s]  to seven hours two days ago drunk? I did that. I don't know what. That's insane to me. And I
[11862.55s -> 11876.01s]  did a backflip. I did. And you weren't here. Somebody link it. It was a full backflip. Not
[11877.19s -> 11884.63s]  baby sister falls down because she's like four and a half months. You know, not like baby brother
[11884.63s -> 11897.56s]  falls. It's a backflip, man. Let's get in that. I think Blender's coming up next.
[11898.36s -> 11922.09s]  All right. Ultimate reality destruction. Coffee machine sink. Lego van. Hellfire missile.
[11924.06s -> 11932.06s]  Ice cooker. A saw. Let's go to the blender. I gotta be careful. I feel like can you,
[11932.06s -> 12022.07s]  can I blend my stuff? Oh, you can blend. Wow. Wow. That was fucking terrifying, actually.
[12022.07s -> 12079.69s]  Um, hold on. I'm not done. Blended gun. Was that, that was loud as fuck. Should I blend a grenade?
[12080.25s -> 12089.80s]  I feel like I have to try. What about one of the little things, right? Like the little,
[12089.80s -> 12113.66s]  Allen wrench here. Get in. The whole purpose of this is to be able to feed things.
[12114.78s -> 12169.82s]  What the fuck? I didn't do anything. It's from fat guy's neck. No. Let's try and restart.
[12177.94s -> 12197.91s]  Coffee maker too. Okay. Here we go. Last thing I want to try. That's not.
[12198.39s -> 12268.89s]  This thing's still spinning. I don't want to. Let's do it for real. For real. Pop the top off
[12268.89s -> 12274.57s]  the lid and as fast as you can say, bop's your uncle, bop is your aunt. You've got a delicious
[12274.57s -> 12296.81s]  strawberry smoothie in the magic bullet. How many parts? 62. Give me a break.
[12297.77s -> 12309.86s]  I can't even pick the fucking thing up. What a hazard. KCH brand. Unbelievable. Imagine you
[12309.86s -> 12326.49s]  picked up a glass pitcher and it exploded in your head. Let's get a good look at this. So we've got
[12326.49s -> 12338.06s]  screws down here. Sit it on. Come on. You fucking Darth Vader mask. Stay here. Look at how tiny
[12338.06s -> 12371.18s]  this is. Ready for this? You got one sound. Let's get in there. Look at that. Now look at this.
[12378.94s -> 12400.74s]  Need the little one. Are you fucking kidding me? Are you? Are you kidding me? No. No. No. No. No.
[12400.74s -> 12414.38s]  No. No. I don't have it. No. How am I supposed to get it? Look at how precise that had to be.
[12415.78s -> 12433.66s]  These are the later levels you can tell. Do this one step at a time. Are you shitting me?
[12436.46s -> 12445.19s]  I'm like sweating so much. My gross disgusting beard. I can feel it like water on it.
[12446.34s -> 12458.86s]  That's just gross. I can't wait to shave and take a bath. Anything else on these? Yeah. Yep.
[12461.94s -> 12469.46s]  I have to shower every day. If I don't shower every single day, it's a nightmare. It's bad.
[12470.42s -> 12483.93s]  Can you guys even see me? Come to it. I cannot go more than a day. I just feel terrible.
[12485.77s -> 12491.69s]  All right. What do we got? We need some clippers.
[12502.39s -> 12513.90s]  Can these sides come off? Okay. Anything else inside of here? Is this thing?
[12516.89s -> 12557.29s]  Ah. Got it. Now what? The tiny little beer cans. How the fuck? Get in there. It requires patience.
[12560.09s -> 12572.57s]  And a steady arm that I don't have. Okay. Let's get clippers. I want the tweezers so bad.
[12577.19s -> 12586.62s]  Don't worry. You're probably saying like, oh, your cable management just sucks. Let's just
[12586.62s -> 12611.70s]  cable it. I'm going to shake it up. I need that in a minute. I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it. All
[12611.70s -> 12632.07s]  right. See? Now we shake it up. Perfect. Perfect. Let's put that there. How do I get this off?
[12634.33s -> 12645.93s]  I have to go from the other side. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Is it a screw or Allen wrench?
[12648.04s -> 12652.98s]  Oh yeah. I thought I had it. I thought that was the one. I thought this was the one.
[12663.48s -> 12667.22s]  Now I actually might be able to get in there. No, it's too big. It's too big.
[12668.79s -> 12679.11s]  Yeah. That shit's too big. Oh wow. Well, that wasn't supposed to happen.
[12684.33s -> 12696.95s]  Come on. I can get the fan. Ah. Holy shit. There's a lot. This is the motor.
[12699.82s -> 12703.98s]  Nothing's too big if you try hard enough. Can you hold the whole blender in one hand and the
[12703.98s -> 12721.62s]  screwdriver in the other? Yeah, you can. It's kind of hard though because your eyes, you guys are
[12721.62s -> 12726.26s]  seeing only the right eye. So this is what you guys get to see. But my left eye is in play and
[12726.26s -> 12731.38s]  the left eye is, you guys don't see the left eye. So when I pull it close like this, I get that weird,
[12731.38s -> 12734.18s]  like when you put something too close to your face, you start to see like double.
[12735.38s -> 12739.78s]  Like, oh, I can't, it's just hard to see right now because I see it. I don't have like a full
[12739.78s -> 12748.30s]  resolution one eye. So it's actually sometimes easier to see it from like here rather than like
[12748.30s -> 12766.71s]  go like this or like that, you know? What am I missing? The pliers? No. What? Is it screwed in?
[12767.35s -> 12787.61s]  What am I missing here? Not the wrench. How do I get that off? Dumb. Dumb. Why am I dumb?
[12792.20s -> 12802.71s]  Try to just close one eye. Jupiter? Is he dumb? I was thinking this, but apparently that's not it.
[12803.35s -> 12823.34s]  What is it then? What? Ah. I'm gonna have to take that apart. Look at that. I want to get a good look
[12823.34s -> 12832.54s]  at that one. Same with this. And I think that's all. It's your road on here. Oh yeah, that's it.
[12833.26s -> 12837.42s]  I don't think this is a piece. I think that's it. I'm just gonna take apart these.
[12845.77s -> 12871.21s]  These little ones. Out of the window? Sure. That's it. Yep. This, where this guy.
[12872.09s -> 12905.45s]  This is where all the meat comes from. Is that it? I feel like that's not it. Whoa. Holy shit.
[12905.45s -> 12925.21s]  This, I got five more parts. Maybe something on here? This shit? It's gotta be this thing.
[12925.21s -> 12941.26s]  Let's go with the wrench maybe. Just like pry it off. What am I missing? Might as well take out
[12941.26s -> 12973.45s]  the tool. What? Oh. No, it is this thing. What of it though? The little pieces? It's not the little
[12973.45s -> 13001.99s]  tiny pieces, right? Whoa. Okay, it was that. Now what? Something over here. Oh, it's the motor.
[13003.35s -> 13035.05s]  Oh, the, not the motor. The blade. You know what I'm trying to say. Cool. Coffee maker. And then
[13035.05s -> 13048.15s]  sink. I'm gonna try the missile. I feel like I should jump to one of these. There's so much
[13048.15s -> 13063.38s]  interesting shit. No, no jumping. No jumping. Yeah, you know what? This game's great.
[13064.33s -> 13086.55s]  I think this is fun as hell. Coffee maker. Can I use it? Oh shit, I can. Give me coffee.
[13087.67s -> 13143.90s]  I don't like it. All right, well, this is where the water goes. Oh, ice cream. Can't break it.
[13143.90s -> 13155.34s]  Can I take this apart? Oh, that's a filter. I feel like I'm gonna have to come back to this one
[13155.34s -> 13165.50s]  because it's a little twisty here, right? There are 93 parts. You got to be kidding me. I'm gonna
[13165.50s -> 13174.15s]  do this slowly and steady. Nothing here. If there's nothing there, get rid of it.
[13178.73s -> 13187.53s]  Nothing, right? This might be, I might need to use that later. Nothing, right? Smash it. That's a,
[13187.53s -> 13189.85s]  I would, I would, where'd you buy those? Because I would love to have them.
[13203.83s -> 13206.95s]  I might need to restart the game. I'm getting a little frame ready.
[13207.67s -> 13225.75s]  Is this, I might need that later. Don't need this. Get out of there. Can I, I can't turn it?
[13226.47s -> 13242.20s]  Now, there's the water tank. Jesus. Can I open this up? I have to be able to, right?
[13246.09s -> 13262.28s]  All right, let's put some sea monkeys in here. Nothing? Don't think so. That bottom,
[13262.28s -> 13269.54s]  I feel like I can take it up, right? That I can, we'll get back to that later.
[13273.24s -> 13298.01s]  Screws? These are thick. I'm still holding on to it. What is still holding on?
[13303.46s -> 13324.70s]  Ah, so this whole, all these guts are gonna fall out here. Still attached.
[13329.35s -> 13351.82s]  I can't get that ring. What is it? Ah, don't fall. What? How you, this is, no, there's two more
[13351.82s -> 13374.62s]  screws. Nothing else on there? I don't think so. You need to do this in real life. I don't think
[13374.62s -> 13391.77s]  that's gonna be, I would never be able to do this. Let's lie on this back. Guys, I have trouble
[13391.77s -> 13396.89s]  replacing the rubber stopper in the toilet bank. You think I'm gonna be able to do something like
[13396.89s -> 13425.46s]  this? Oh shoot, it still works. Whoa! I don't know why I think that's funny. Like, I'm gonna put it
[13425.46s -> 13436.41s]  down my pants. I don't, I don't know, I don't understand. I don't know why that's something
[13436.41s -> 13451.50s]  I'm doing, but that's the second time I got it. Whoa, holy shit. The buttons might have to come
[13451.50s -> 13472.09s]  off on here. Yeah, the buttons definitely have to come off. Really? Apparently not.
[13474.81s -> 13486.68s]  That's what it looks like. This is what it looks like inside your computer. Damn.
[13503.42s -> 13516.79s]  All right, let's do, let's take this slow. Can't do that. Yeah, let's just get the screws.
[13517.35s -> 13549.93s]  There's a couple of big ones. Whoa, what am I doing? No, no, no, no, no, no. Pick it up. Spin it.
[13551.05s -> 13555.67s]  Okay, let's hold on to the brackets here, but I don't think I can move the brackets.
[13556.63s -> 13563.03s]  Not yet. Still more screws. There's a ton of screws. I can't move this. I can't move that.
[13563.03s -> 13577.10s]  Oh, I can get this. Wait, don't. Hold on. I gotta slide this shit off. What? How do I get that off?
[13584.76s -> 13604.36s]  The screw? Screw? Undo the clamps. Yeah, but I, how the fuck can I do that? I don't know if
[13604.36s -> 13635.67s]  I can do that. Hold on to it. All right, so now, get these off. Nice. So what, what, okay,
[13635.67s -> 13656.92s]  this, this tank is being held on by exactly sure. You can get rid of that. Does this have to come
[13656.92s -> 13670.98s]  off? I don't think so, but I'm scared. So I'm gonna hold on to it. Lego piece. Give me the little,
[13670.98s -> 13688.62s]  no, give me this. Can't like rip this shit off now. That's still attached. Ah, fuck, right here.
[13693.43s -> 13703.61s]  All right, this is still screwed in. God damn, am I getting sick again? Like my, my throat,
[13703.61s -> 13709.88s]  I'm getting that, like, I have a cold feeling in my throat. I just got over being sick. Not again.
[13715.77s -> 13722.20s]  You know, you know what I'm talking about? You just feel it in the back of your mouth and throat.
[13724.84s -> 13729.90s]  I just got over being sick. I want to unscrew more things.
[13737.78s -> 13748.82s]  What? I gotta get the pliers and snip this. Apparently not. Is it the, which one is it?
[13751.78s -> 13764.44s]  All right, let's shake it. Get those loose pliers out of here. All right, fuck, get,
[13764.44s -> 13778.92s]  this is my workstation. Get the fuck away from me. Clean workstation. Where they plugged into over here.
[13778.92s -> 13793.02s]  That should be able to shake them all out now. There's a couple more that go down. I can't move
[13793.02s -> 13819.38s]  them. All right, now that leaves. What is holding this down? There goes that. There goes that one.
[13819.38s -> 13828.79s]  Anything else? Can I pull these off? I don't think so. I think that's it. All right, now I got some
[13828.79s -> 13839.38s]  more freedom here. Does that help? How do I get this off? This thing is still screwed in here.
[13844.42s -> 13859.24s]  Hmm. Whoa, whoa, when did I get this? I got needle nose pliers now? I didn't even know I had these.
[13859.88s -> 13884.20s]  Holy shit. Well, that's a major paw jam. I need to get these unscrewed. All right, well somehow that
[13884.20s -> 13895.27s]  worked. Magically, I got that to work. How do I get you off? Screwed on? There's nothing holding
[13895.27s -> 13903.53s]  this. Whoa, okay. What is holding this down? There's nothing holding this down.
[13924.22s -> 13931.96s]  Hover to find out what tool to use. I feel like that'll just stop. Okay, wait a minute. Slow down.
[13937.40s -> 13951.64s]  All right. Okay, I got another work area here. I need to pull this out? I guess not. Itchy nose.
[13952.60s -> 13955.16s]  Uh, 21 more parts. I'm assuming they're all here.
[13959.58s -> 13967.58s]  All right, let's get the pliers. The good ones.
[13972.33s -> 13997.74s]  Oh, shit. Can't get rid of that yet. Spin this around. All right, shake that.
[13998.38s -> 14030.15s]  A couple more screws. Can I move that yet? Not yet. Why? One more. Oh, that last screw always feels
[14030.15s -> 14049.80s]  the best. Out comes that. Oh, we get to see the brain. Ain't nothing in there. All right,
[14050.36s -> 14062.94s]  four more pieces. What's this? This? There's gonna be this shit in here. Two pieces.
[14063.58s -> 14077.02s]  Well, there's nothing in there. It's this right here, isn't it? One, two. Give me that piece.
[14082.97s -> 14118.74s]  One piece. What's in here? All right, bring it out. Let's see. Is it the ice cream scoop? It is.
[14118.74s -> 14134.73s]  That was a lot longer than seven minutes. I thought that was under money. That glass just
[14134.73s -> 14145.88s]  is fucking killing me. All right, let me see. I'm starting to think that the tank is getting
[14145.88s -> 14152.30s]  empty here. No, not that, not that. I think I'm just going to play this tomorrow.
[14158.95s -> 14172.82s]  I love this. Sink. Missile. Titanic. Car. Plane. Train. Space station.
[14175.03s -> 14187.56s]  Oh, this. All right. Guys, I'm gonna. Why do I have to be so tired? Only four hours?
[14188.76s -> 14198.20s]  Come on, I can do more than four. Usually I can do like four and a half to five. All right,
[14198.20s -> 14220.10s]  we're gonna do like one or two more. No, that's too early. I'll do one more. So drained. No skipping.
[14220.10s -> 14227.22s]  I'm just gonna beat this whole damn game. You know what? It was the rage in the house.
[14228.02s -> 14232.63s]  It was the house rage. This one's gonna be quick. I can do two more.
[14252.94s -> 14257.27s]  If this shit is too fragile. All right, I get it. Hold on.
[14262.01s -> 14273.86s]  Clean it up. That's a nice water sound though. All right, that's fine. Let's get it out of the way.
[14277.56s -> 14294.31s]  All right. Turn this off. Can I even turn this off? All right. Can I pull it out of the wall?
[14299.59s -> 14314.09s]  Oh, Jesus. I can't turn it off anymore. My batarangs out of the way. All right.
[14314.73s -> 14321.05s]  You see what your problem is, is you hulked through the sink. I think that's probably what
[14321.05s -> 14333.91s]  the issue is here. But I've been wrong. Can you fix it? I can't. I fixed it. No, I don't think so.
[14333.91s -> 14341.78s]  You're gonna have to call a real bummer. I'm just gonna steal all these parts.
[14342.34s -> 14364.47s]  Know what copper is worth? God, no. Is there anything I can do about that?
[14367.61s -> 14384.36s]  All right. Look, I gotta get under here. Oh, that was that was the water. Would you look at that?
[14385.08s -> 14403.05s]  And we can pop this. No, we can't. Now you can pop this. Ah, screws in there.
[14408.95s -> 14418.52s]  Come on. That's how I get in here. Oh, my God. How am I supposed to get this?
[14419.24s -> 14457.11s]  Maybe I'm not supposed to get it. I don't know. I pull this up. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay.
[14460.12s -> 14481.93s]  It's kind of just floating. How much is left? Six more. Oh, shit. There's something else.
[14485.40s -> 14524.82s]  Uh, oh, it's hard to get in here because I can't. Do you see? No, it's like a gorilla trying to open
[14524.82s -> 14556.71s]  up a fucking twist off coke. You know what I mean? It's not gonna happen. These little wrench things?
[14557.99s -> 14560.95s]  I don't think so. I can't get them off.
[14560.95s -> 14595.35s]  Fuck. Four? How do I get these off? I can't get them off. Knock plier.
[14614.14s -> 14621.96s]  We don't have any clue. We don't have any clue. Stop looking at chat is what somebody said.
[14622.44s -> 14664.92s]  Why do I have two of these? This thing? What the fuck? Okay, so with three. God damn it. No.
[14666.65s -> 14692.06s]  Okay, it was that. Guys, how the fuck am I gonna do this? I can't get these off. It's the screw.
[14692.06s -> 14703.91s]  Yeah, I can't get these off. Not the wires. Hold on, I'm gonna move these out of the way. Okay,
[14703.91s -> 14751.86s]  I'll bring up the ghost finder. What? Shit. Where's the other one? I can't get in here.
[14756.98s -> 14774.04s]  Is that it? God damn it, it is. How do I get in there? I can't get my screwdriver in there.
[14774.04s -> 14821.16s]  No, we already talked about the gorilla with the coke. What? What am I doing wrong? Two? It's one
[14821.16s -> 14842.50s]  thing. I don't think I'm doing this right. I'm like a ghost in this person's house. Screw it.
[14842.58s -> 14884.50s]  The little silver thing is copper. That's not what you meant. That's not the right way. It's
[14884.50s -> 14892.58s]  not the right way. Way. I'm so tired right now. I'm just like slugging on the ground. Imagine you
[14892.58s -> 14900.02s]  walked in. You walked in. There's a guy preparing your sink and he's crouching lying on the ground
[14900.02s -> 14908.62s]  just going, hey, there's no way. I don't know where it is. I don't understand. Do you? And you
[14908.62s -> 14914.81s]  see a little thing? You'd be like, holy shit, you get out of my fucking house. Imagine his
[14914.81s -> 14924.70s]  germs on his tiptoes. That's funny. I'm looking for one of these. I honestly got no fucking idea
[14924.70s -> 14941.29s]  what's going on. All right. So mouse plumber. It's this thing. See? Not that thing. This thing.
[14952.63s -> 14994.58s]  No, don't use the gun. I can't get in here. I did it. Oh, I fixed your sink.
[14996.02s -> 15008.81s]  That'll be $400. You can write me a check. That's B-A-C. Reverse plumbing and heating.
[15008.81s -> 15031.50s]  God. Time for the Lego van. I don't know. I'm out of fucking juice. Let's see. What do I got?
[15036.10s -> 15038.34s]  Let's at least look at it. Okay. Let's look at it.
[15042.42s -> 15047.14s]  It's so small. All right. Oh my God. Can I pick the whole thing?
[15049.91s -> 15054.07s]  This is tiny. Oh my God. I want to put it on the ground and lie down.
[15056.82s -> 15060.01s]  I can't put it on the ground and lie down. I have an idea.
[15064.66s -> 15072.52s]  I'm still lying on the table. All right. That's how we do this. All right.
[15074.44s -> 15082.70s]  I think I'm going to eat grapes from a vine. Oh, yeah. Come on. Come on in, sweetheart.
[15084.30s -> 15096.33s]  Yeah. Do you think this is sexy, what I'm doing here? That's right. Seriously. I can't throw it.
[15096.33s -> 15098.65s]  This one's actually going to take not that long. Ready? Watch this.
[15121.45s -> 15137.80s]  Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. Yep. This is what a cat feels like. This is what it's like to be a cat.
[15137.80s -> 15172.28s]  This is life as a cat. This one. Get off the counter.
[15206.49s -> 15212.41s]  Weird cat can fucking slowly fall off the table. Yeah. They always land on their
[15212.41s -> 15216.49s]  fore front feet. You know why that is? Because when they fall, they fall in slow motion.
[15217.21s -> 15233.50s]  All right. One more. I don't know. Whoops. All right. Give her some juice.
[15239.56s -> 15250.02s]  Ah, I can't. I don't know. Same on the gas. Well, the engine's running. Let's try something.
[15250.66s -> 15265.94s]  Give it a little more gas. Yeah. That's a car fixing. I'm invincible. I didn't tell you. I'm
[15266.02s -> 15318.46s]  invincible. All right. We have to dissect a missile. Hellfire missile. I can't throw the missile.
[15325.18s -> 15327.74s]  I always thought you had to be careful with this shit.
[15333.00s -> 15338.58s]  All right. Why inside of a missile there's a bunch of Christmas decorations?
[15340.25s -> 15345.13s]  That was a part. That was a pinata. That was a novelty pinata.
[15347.10s -> 15372.20s]  Uh, that was going to be scary. No, apparently not. Will it, does it explode? Maybe it's because
[15372.20s -> 15379.58s]  I took off the on button. Hold on. Maybe I should give it a starter.
[15383.26s -> 15394.26s]  There was clearly a second exploded, but the little cartoon grenade was more powerful than the,
[15394.26s -> 15402.95s]  whatever this is, like this missile. Here it goes. Look at how, I just want to,
[15402.95s -> 15408.36s]  just look at how many parts are everywhere. I want to see how many parts this is.
[15409.62s -> 15419.74s]  This is going to be like probably 200 parts. 102. Damn. All right. I think that's going to be it.
[15424.12s -> 15426.92s]  Four and a half, like just about four and a half hours. We'll do bits about five hours.
[15427.82s -> 15434.01s]  I got to take a break. Gravity gun. Well, I'm going to play this tomorrow.
[15436.22s -> 15442.98s]  So I, this is what we're doing tomorrow. Cause that was fun as hell. That was great.
[15448.25s -> 15450.73s]  You'll forget about tomorrow. I'm not going to forget tomorrow.
[15453.42s -> 15462.50s]  No, I'm not taking tomorrow off. I took yesterday off. I'm not. No, we're doing,
[15462.50s -> 15468.46s]  we'll do it tomorrow. Get in Minecraft VR. I did expect that I was going to play the four and a
[15468.46s -> 15480.84s]  half hours. You're always going to forget. No, I'll be, I'll be like tomorrow. At least throw the
[15480.84s -> 15484.04s]  missile out the window. Okay. I'm going to try to get the missile out the window. No, it won't go
[15484.04s -> 15497.37s]  out the window. Watch. Just watch. Yeah. Typically two nights ago was not an indicator of a VR
[15497.37s -> 15502.66s]  stream. Usually my VR streams are only like four to five hours because I can't, I can't be in here
[15502.66s -> 15507.62s]  for that long. I just can't, I don't know how the fuck I did it for like seven hours, two nights ago.
[15507.62s -> 15520.71s]  It was a shit face. All right. I'm going to try to get out of here. I need to break this precisely.
[15524.92s -> 15535.30s]  Wait, I have this now? I didn't know I had this. This is why you guys were saying that. How do I
[15535.30s -> 15561.75s]  use it? Is this all it does? Trigger pressure adjusts grab force. Okay. I see. It's actually
[15561.75s -> 15569.06s]  kind of useful. All right. Let's, let's get out of here. See if I can actually get this out the window.
[15571.45s -> 15623.34s]  Okay. Come with me. That ain't going out there. I'll try to get it. There's a wall here. I can't
[15623.34s -> 15645.00s]  get it. Christmas gold thing. Have any gun from the outside? Move the window. Shoot the Lego van.
[15645.88s -> 15660.62s]  Why do I recognize the sound effect? Cause it's a stock sound effect. Don't look down.
[15661.02s -> 15674.07s]  The Christmas gold thing. That's how you know I'm at a gas. Ah, the Christmas gold thing.
[15675.90s -> 15679.75s]  All right. I'll turn it off. Can't hurt it anymore. All right. Let's just chill for a little bit.
[15684.49s -> 15687.93s]  If you're going to take off, you take off. But I'm not going to turn the stream off completely.
[15687.93s -> 15693.10s]  I'm going to get the chair back in here. We'll hang out, do the bits, chill for like 30, 40 minutes.
[15696.31s -> 15702.79s]  Yeah. I'll post that on Twitter. We're going, yeah, we're going to go on low power mode.
[15702.79s -> 15707.38s]  Sometimes it just does it to me. You looking at the sun? Sorry about that.
[15708.36s -> 15711.78s]  All right. I'll be right back. We'll go for like another 30, 40 plus minutes.
[15712.42s -> 15899.83s]  Got to go over five hours. All right. We don't have to, but we will. Ah, that's another thing.
[15899.83s -> 15906.07s]  It is like a thousand degrees in here. Just adds to it. I think VR Josh was talking about it. I
[15906.07s -> 15914.74s]  need to get like a fan to just go, but then it kind of makes noise from outside in the hall to
[15914.74s -> 15922.63s]  this room. It's like at least 20 degrees difference. That's an on top of it too. That's
[15922.63s -> 15929.18s]  another reason why I got to get some like circulation, but I'm happy with going four
[15929.18s -> 15940.86s]  hours in VR. That's kind of typical last time before shit faced Saturday. I didn't want it to
[15940.86s -> 15947.48s]  be less than four hours though. That's, that's too small, too short, but let's just go like this.
[15948.44s -> 15953.00s]  Let's just hang out for a little bit. Move this over here.
[15953.64s -> 15964.30s]  Uh, can I not do that? I shouldn't be able to. Hey, look, full camera needs to be brought down
[15964.30s -> 15971.82s]  a little though. This is what it looked like without glasses. See people are going, well,
[15971.82s -> 15985.85s]  that's what it looks like without glasses. Yeah. I don't want to get stretched. Why's this camera
[15985.85s -> 15997.56s]  doing this? No, it's cause it's up too high. All right. Here's the portion of the stream. We're
[15997.56s -> 16002.44s]  just going to sit around and hang out for a little while. Maybe like 30, 40 minutes. We'll
[16002.44s -> 16007.22s]  do the bits while we chill. Let me get the chat over here too. Just cause you know, I need to
[16007.22s -> 16016.23s]  be able to see what you guys are saying. Did I X out of it? Like an idiot. All right. So see,
[16016.23s -> 16020.55s]  okay, everyone, okay, the drunk stream two nights ago, when I took that headset off and I was sitting
[16020.55s -> 16026.23s]  here, everyone's like, look at how red he is. He's fucked up. Look at his hair. This is a normal
[16026.23s -> 16038.01s]  human, not drunk guy. And it's the same shit. So see, he's drunk again. Look at how flushed and
[16038.01s -> 16048.57s]  fucking sloppy he is. No Labo VR. I'm going to do Labo VR. You already know that. Only a drunk
[16048.57s -> 16056.28s]  person would say something like that. All right. Let me, uh, let's get the bits on here. Let's go
[16056.28s -> 16062.20s]  like this. If you take it off, we'll see tomorrow. More, uh, take stuff apart. I can't wait to take
[16062.20s -> 16077.48s]  apart the plane. I think, I think I found my new house flipper. I'm for real. What's on my face?
[16078.28s -> 16084.86s]  Uh, a dirty beard that I haven't shaved yet. And I probably won't do it until like tomorrow night.
[16084.86s -> 16094.33s]  Is that game of the year? Don't say that yet. We've still got like another few months or like
[16094.33s -> 16102.84s]  seven. Yes, I'm going to do the, I will do the new Labo sets. I promise. All right. So let's go back
[16103.94s -> 16112.78s]  a little while ago. We had, uh, Icy Youpi gave $10 earlier. They say cool stream kiddo. Thank you.
[16112.78s -> 16118.60s]  Thanks for coming up. Hope you enjoyed it. Can we collab? Can we collab? Can we collab?
[16119.16s -> 16131.38s]  What are you talking about? Why is everybody saying that? Can we collab? That was happening
[16131.38s -> 16139.96s]  before the stream started. Well, the answer is no. No, I don't do collabs. I, I do organic
[16139.96s -> 16144.28s]  accidental. We, if somebody's a friend and we do something, I don't, I don't do collabs.
[16149.74s -> 16153.66s]  Well, these faces that I, you know, I couldn't, I always, I never thought,
[16153.66s -> 16159.35s]  I never knew what that was until, um, I had better Twitch TV. I thought you guys are just
[16159.35s -> 16165.67s]  always at that. I didn't know that was an actual emote face. Played Toribash. I did play,
[16165.67s -> 16170.07s]  me and Star played Toribash like a couple of years ago, about like six years ago actually.
[16173.11s -> 16178.23s]  That was a long time. It was like 2012. If you want to watch Toribash, me play Toribash with a
[16178.23s -> 16192.07s]  friend, that video is still there. What's in here? You think that's still all right? I don't think
[16192.07s -> 16198.07s]  so. Plus it's like nine o'clock at night. Why would I do that? But thank you to, uh, Icy Youpi
[16198.07s -> 16204.46s]  for the 10 bucks. Smelly boy, thanks for the 250. Please, please, please tell us where Shido is.
[16204.46s -> 16209.10s]  I heard he's going to prison for trying to 3D print. What are you talking about? He,
[16210.52s -> 16272.07s]  Shido is in the other room. So what you guys didn't know is I can actually do these noises
[16272.07s -> 16298.74s]  with my mouth. You know what I mean? So I'm sorry that Shido is no longer here. Show us. Yeah,
[16298.74s -> 16306.15s]  this is in the cartoon when the, uh, when the, the big giant monster eats the person or eats,
[16306.15s -> 16310.79s]  eats the character that is in the show or something, or like a squeaky toy. And every time they try to
[16310.79s -> 16315.27s]  talk, they're just, they usually have a booming voice like this. And then when they open their
[16315.27s -> 16320.20s]  mouth, they like swallow it and they eat it. Oh no, the character's dead. I did that.
[16322.04s -> 16337.48s]  And then it becomes like a joke. There, Shido's right here. You're fine. See,
[16337.48s -> 16342.78s]  everybody thought I like threw it away. Why'd I throw this away? Somebody says you're a joke,
[16342.78s -> 16372.89s]  Jeremy. I got nothing to say about that. You're probably right. You're a joke. It's all right.
[16372.89s -> 16384.15s]  There's worse things I could be. Anyways, let's keep going. Uh, that was smelly boy. We proved it.
[16384.15s -> 16390.78s]  So Number Guts, 10 bucks from Number Guts. Thank you, Number Guts. Uh, consider my wig snatched
[16390.78s -> 16403.93s]  bald. I don't know what that means. My wig? I mean, I know this looks bad, but I don't know.
[16404.09s -> 16413.64s]  Might not even be what you're referring to, but thank you. Also, uh, uh, Zach said, Zach SD,
[16413.64s -> 16418.58s]  Zach East. I hope I'm saying that right. 10 dollars. Uh, hey man, I genuinely appreciate
[16418.58s -> 16421.78s]  your content and the effort you put into it. Your videos and streams got me through some
[16421.78s -> 16429.94s]  tough times. Cheers from Finland. Cheers back to you. Thank you. Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[16429.94s -> 16435.35s]  Thanks for sticking around the community. Kim check. Kim is not in there. I did, I was just
[16435.35s -> 16446.36s]  downstairs, but, uh, thanks for the 10 dollars. I appreciate every one of you guys that comes
[16446.36s -> 16452.04s]  out and watches this channel. So I couldn't do it without you. It wouldn't be possible.
[16452.60s -> 16464.36s]  So thank you, Kim. I almost just ran over my VR headset. I just crushed it and I would have blamed
[16464.36s -> 16469.99s]  all of you. I would have put the blame on you guys. That's like 500 bucks. I would have just
[16469.99s -> 16482.01s]  crushed it. I'll prove it again. Nobody in here. Well, okay. The boy who cried wolf. I'm going to
[16482.01s -> 16488.98s]  do that so many times. That one time someone's going to be actually in there. It's messy. It
[16488.98s -> 16495.88s]  is messy and it's very messy. It's an incredibly messy closet, but it's okay. But thank you, Zach.
[16495.88s -> 16501.24s]  Appreciate it. Superintendent Chalmers, two dollars, 66 cents. What do I think about the Star
[16501.24s -> 16505.40s]  Wars episode nine trailer? If you haven't seen it, do a YouTuber reaction on stream. I already saw it.
[16506.44s -> 16513.06s]  There's not enough info to go on, but there are some characters. Seems pretty cool.
[16514.18s -> 16517.22s]  If people are trying to avoid spoilers, I don't really want to talk about it because a lot of
[16517.22s -> 16522.90s]  people don't want to read or see spoilers. And there are a few things in that trailer that could
[16522.90s -> 16530.74s]  be, wow, I wish I didn't know that, right? So there are a few characters. I'm not going to tell you
[16530.74s -> 16536.58s]  who they are, but they're in it. You have an Ant-Man shirt on because you can relate to being
[16537.14s -> 16543.62s]  incredibly talented and very handsome and soaring like an eagle and be very, really cool.
[16543.62s -> 16547.78s]  And like Paul Rudd's really cool. And he's, he's like 50 years old and he looks like he's
[16547.78s -> 16551.94s]  fucking 28. What a person to be compared to. Thanks for comparing me to Paul Rudd. I appreciate that.
[16552.50s -> 16569.53s]  It means a lot. Stormy Chu. I missed this. I missed this. Stormy Chu gave 50 dollars,
[16569.53s -> 16575.58s]  5,000 bits from Stormy Chu. Thank you so much for the 50 fucking dollars. Wanted to remind you that
[16575.58s -> 16579.34s]  you're the best streamer. Whenever I'm in a bad mood, you can always manage to make me laugh.
[16579.34s -> 16585.88s]  You're doing great things and I hope you and Chad have a wonderful evening. Thank you. I'm sure other
[16585.88s -> 16594.87s]  people in chat are happy to hear that as well. You wishing everybody a wonderful evening.
[16597.85s -> 16606.58s]  For as much as people give me credit, right? Like so many people here are so funny and I see so
[16606.58s -> 16611.86s]  many people write like, oh, like, hey, have a good evening, Chad. Or like, oh, Chad, I met some
[16611.86s -> 16620.57s]  friends in chat or it, there's so much fucking going on here that you guys are so nice. Look,
[16620.57s -> 16626.50s]  we fucking around a lot. We do, but everyone's so nice to each other. It's refreshing. So many
[16626.50s -> 16631.48s]  people are just fun here and there's a huge difference. I know, like I said, that this,
[16631.48s -> 16636.44s]  we say shit, we make fun of stuff. We, I mean, like I said, like 80% of the stuff we say is
[16636.44s -> 16644.18s]  just bullshit. You guys all know that, but I'm so shocked and surprised every day at just how
[16646.04s -> 16655.88s]  like fun of a community this is. I'm very fortunate. So 100% of what I say is bullshit.
[16655.88s -> 16664.74s]  Well, there you go. At least you've made it clear now, but still make sure that thank you for the
[16664.74s -> 16670.74s]  $50. That's more money than I could ever ask anyone to ever hand me through a stream. So
[16671.77s -> 16681.62s]  thank you. That means a shitload. 50 bucks. Make sure to floss too, as Grub Club says. Yes.
[16682.58s -> 16688.98s]  Chunky Baloney, 10 bucks, $10 from Chunky Baloney. Thank you. In summer camp one year,
[16688.98s -> 16694.18s]  I was messing around with a bicycle tire just like that and accidentally busted somebody's
[16694.18s -> 16705.14s]  lip open. They had to go to the hospital and get multiple stitches. Don't do that. Be careful.
[16706.42s -> 16716.25s]  You can actually get fucked up like that. Don't do it. Accidentally, in quotes. Guys, it's not,
[16716.89s -> 16720.33s]  it's not like you're going to spin the wheel and like go after somebody with it.
[16722.23s -> 16725.96s]  They do that on Malcolm in the Middle. Is that where, is that what that's from? I thought it
[16725.96s -> 16732.34s]  was from Pee Wee Herman. Doesn't that happen in Pee Wee? That happens in Pee Wee Herman's
[16732.34s -> 16749.80s]  movie, right? That definitely happens in a Pee Wee Herman bit. I think so. What happens? The
[16749.80s -> 16753.88s]  bike thing when you spin the bike upside down so the wheels are pointing up and then somebody
[16753.88s -> 16758.04s]  goes like this with the wheel and then somebody else's face gets like burnt on the, that's from
[16758.04s -> 16770.31s]  a Pee Wee Herman. He's still on this. I'm not. Somebody just brought it up and I'm explaining.
[16772.09s -> 16777.37s]  Supposed to be end screen music. Uh, I don't have the end screen up. We're just chilling out.
[16778.17s -> 16786.60s]  I'm almost done. There's not very many more left to go. So he's going to go until someone says,
[16786.60s -> 16791.34s]  yes. What do you mean? But thank you, Chunky Ballona. And that sounds like a horrible fucking
[16791.34s -> 16797.27s]  story. Hopefully everyone's all right. Number Guts, Five Dolls from Number Guts. Hey, German,
[16797.27s -> 16801.59s]  me and my partners have watched you for a long time and you've been an incredible and consistent
[16801.59s -> 16806.39s]  source of joy. I've been going through a lot over the past few years and your content's helped me
[16806.39s -> 16817.77s]  make some of the real bad days a little easier. Thank you. Thank you for being here. And I say it
[16817.77s -> 16822.17s]  a lot, but I have to say it a lot because I really only fucking care about us having a good time.
[16823.35s -> 16827.51s]  If you are having fun, that's fucking awesome. I'm glad because that's all I give a shit about.
[16827.51s -> 16835.38s]  All this, this, this, all this, this room, this room, the whole room is just, I want to have fun
[16835.38s -> 16842.50s]  and I want you to do too. The whole thing. I'll rip, I'll rip that closet door off if it means
[16842.50s -> 16847.86s]  you're going to have fun. I will rip it off with my bare hands and I'll snap it off my fucking knee
[16847.86s -> 16855.83s]  like twig in a dream, in fake reality. Not real. Dude, why would I, I can't do that. That's a
[16856.39s -> 16861.91s]  95% of everything I say is not true. Use a screwdriver for, yeah, I'm just going to go in
[16861.91s -> 16868.04s]  there and like rip it off the hinges. You don't, you won't do that for us. I'm not going to, no.
[16871.58s -> 16884.50s]  Oh, rum fun. Rum. Rum. My rump. My room. Jeremy, you look defeated. No, I look like I was in VR for
[16884.50s -> 16889.54s]  four and a half hours. This is why the drunk, I told you the drunk stream was so much worse.
[16891.21s -> 16895.64s]  I said this in the chat in the beginning of the stream, but I want to make it clear again.
[16895.64s -> 16904.09s]  When you drink and do VR, you save state yourself outside of the headset. So when I was like drinking
[16904.09s -> 16910.26s]  the wine and going into the headset, I, reality was different. It wasn't, I was like getting
[16910.26s -> 16915.62s]  drunker because like in the headset, I wasn't drunk. When the headset would come off, it'd be
[16915.62s -> 16922.73s]  like, I mean, it was, I was saved stating my drunkenness. It was crazy. And VR Josh was
[16922.73s -> 16928.41s]  talking about how, because in the headset, it's, he's right. You don't see blurry vision in VR.
[16928.41s -> 16935.75s]  It's everything so crystal clear that you don't even realize. So you take the headset off and
[16935.75s -> 16942.41s]  all of a sudden you're like, take another sip and you're like, holy fuck. It's just, it makes
[16942.41s -> 16948.49s]  you five times drunker. Be careful. Don't, don't drink and do VR for too long. Like I did. Although
[16948.49s -> 16957.34s]  I was fine, but just, you know, your health is important. I would puke if I drank and put on my
[16957.34s -> 16964.31s]  headset. Why do you think I needed to take yesterday off? I drank an entire bottle of wine two days ago
[16964.31s -> 16978.26s]  and did VR for seven hours. Like that was energy levels. What's going on here? I'm going to leave
[16978.26s -> 16986.30s]  it. I'm going to leave it to scare away all the new people. Where's the mouth vomit clip? I don't
[16986.30s -> 16991.82s]  know, but I forgot that I did that. I did that. I did the fake insta puke. Somebody has to have it.
[16994.23s -> 17001.35s]  I went back and I looked at the VOD. No, nobody laughed at this. They were concerned. I thought
[17001.35s -> 17004.15s]  people were going to think it was funny because I've done it a couple of times before, but I did
[17004.15s -> 17011.03s]  like the fake insta puke swallow it. Nobody thought it was funny. It was like so realistic
[17011.03s -> 17017.88s]  because I was so drunk. People were like, stop, stop, are you all right? I don't think anybody has
[17017.88s -> 17028.38s]  a clip of it. I didn't even acknowledge that I did it either. Is this channel bits only? What are you
[17028.38s -> 17040.97s]  talking about? We're almost done. It's been like 15 minutes. Nobody wants to see it again. I kind
[17040.97s -> 17049.24s]  of wanted to see it though. You were retroactively saying it was a joke. I've done that like three or
[17049.24s -> 17057.66s]  four times before. I've gotten that down real well that people can fucking be confused by it.
[17058.14s -> 17065.11s]  That's that's the snort clip of my click on that. If there's one thing that I know how to do really
[17065.11s -> 17069.67s]  well, it's fake insta puke and insta swallow it and make it look like it actually happened.
[17069.67s -> 17076.52s]  It's one of my talents. One of the things I can do. But let's move on. We're almost done.
[17079.11s -> 17084.38s]  Soul Harry, thanks for the 260. Hey Jerma, could you please do us a favor and save the
[17084.38s -> 17089.59s]  Mind Show Dread Hall stream from last time to your channel's highlights before it's deleted?
[17089.59s -> 17097.27s]  Why would it be deleted? Chat was fantastic that whole stream and also an integral part of
[17097.35s -> 17104.97s]  understanding the Kim scare. We wouldn't want it to be lost in time. Oh you talk about after 60 days.
[17105.53s -> 17114.26s]  Yeah well it's deleted after two months. Well that means that like the drunk stream is forever
[17114.26s -> 17122.20s]  etched in my Twitch bibliography. I don't know if I want to do that. That's the thing that's
[17122.20s -> 17128.31s]  number one on my highlights. That would be the only one I have. Oh yeah man like come on to
[17128.31s -> 17134.63s]  Jerma985. What have you got for highlights? Let's see. From 2011, testing to see if the
[17134.63s -> 17139.67s]  highlight feature works with a hand of fate clip where he accidentally clicks on something
[17139.67s -> 17143.67s]  and dies from a boulder. And he never deleted that for some reason. I don't know why he didn't.
[17144.31s -> 17158.82s]  And an entire stream of him embarrassingly drunk. Sounds great. YouTube. Yeah the YouTube
[17158.82s -> 17169.27s]  archive is fine. Maybe I'll maybe I'll just get see if we can pull the chat. Maybe I can pull that
[17169.27s -> 17179.26s]  chat. There's no chat. I can pull that chat. I can pull that chat. We'll get a way to pull that chat
[17179.26s -> 17191.64s]  out. Embarrassingly drunk. We'll get that chat. Don't worry. But thank you for the 260. Appreciate
[17191.64s -> 17196.20s]  it. Ethan Ricks. Thanks for 10 dollars here. Long time viewer. First time subber and donator. You're
[17196.20s -> 17202.44s]  the funniest person in the world. That's a that's a lot. That means thank you. In my opinion you
[17202.44s -> 17211.02s]  always make my day so this is my way to repay you for your content you rat bastard. That's a that's
[17211.02s -> 17219.30s]  a heavy load to hold. I'm shocked. I can't believe you think I'm that funny or entertaining. Thank
[17219.30s -> 17231.98s]  you. I hope it can stay that way. I hope you still have fun. There it is. Is this it? Oh this is it.
[17231.98s -> 17239.46s]  I need to watch this on stream. I can't wait to see this. I get this like shit eating grit on my
[17239.46s -> 17258.54s]  face. Hold on. Give me a second. I gotta change my audio here. Speakers. Okay. Can you guys hear
[17258.54s -> 17274.14s]  that? You should be able to hear that now. No shit you can't. Hey there we go. Okay. All right let's
[17274.14s -> 17302.31s]  get this on screen. Wait I do it again? I don't I don't remember doing that again.
[17302.95s -> 17306.41s]  Holy shit I did it like four times. Always doing something different.
[17306.41s -> 17317.69s]  Wait wait wait wait wait. The whole vines. Hold on. Are you talking about the talent? Are you talking
[17317.69s -> 17336.15s]  about like who I think is the funniest and most interesting? What do you think? Who? Everyone
[17336.15s -> 17342.62s]  fucking was freaking out. Second one was no none of them are real. None of them are real.
[17348.04s -> 17369.08s]  Uh the chat is the best. The chat is so fucking funny. Can I get it? Oh. Are you talking about
[17369.80s -> 17380.18s]  who I think is the funniest? People usually people weren't laughing. Stop. See stop.
[17380.18s -> 17390.92s]  Sad face. Who? Oh fuck. What what the fuck? Vinny. Joel. What the fuck? MonkaS. They always do.
[17390.92s -> 17400.78s]  What the fuck? Ew. What? What the fuck was that noise? Stop it. The whole Vinesauce team
[17400.78s -> 17418.87s]  always doing something. God damn it man. I don't know. I've got something fucking wrong with me.
[17424.60s -> 17429.56s]  Uh but thank you EthanRix for the 10 bucks. Thank you JermaWide about Fruity Loops.
[17431.34s -> 17438.52s]  Damn this streamer is kind of cringy. Why the fuck would you say something like that? Okay.
[17444.42s -> 17457.59s]  I can't get it to play again. So this streamer is like this stream is kind of cringy huh?
[17457.59s -> 17467.43s]  That's interesting. Like never mind. It's all fucked up. I can't even do it. It's fucked up.
[17468.07s -> 17487.74s]  Well thank you for the 250. Whatever. That don't matter. Uh thank you for the 250. JermaWide
[17487.74s -> 17501.59s]  lied about Fruity Loops. Not yet. Is it a lie if it eventually happens? That's not a lie. If it
[17501.59s -> 17514.55s]  happens it happens. Thank you for the 250. Thank you Novaz for the 250. Is the green screen parts
[17514.55s -> 17523.38s]  do still have? I could have pat my face. Yes. Oh there's been so many though. I have to.
[17526.89s -> 17537.18s]  Yes. Yes. Yes. There's so many. I could have. Yes. So I have an Instagram. I do not have an
[17537.18s -> 17544.39s]  Instagram account. I don't have any social media accounts besides Twitter. And I haven't tweeted a
[17544.39s -> 17549.75s]  real tweet this since like February. So I don't do social media. I'm disconnected from social media.
[17550.39s -> 17559.30s]  This is the only social media that I have. YouTube channels. Twitch. My Twitter. My official
[17559.30s -> 17565.93s]  Jerma985 Twitter. And that's it. I had a Facebook at one point. I haven't said anything on that
[17565.93s -> 17573.80s]  Facebook in probably four and a half years. Nothing. I don't do the social media thing.
[17574.52s -> 17580.28s]  Except for here. Right now. It's my entire. My entire career is social media. But I don't
[17580.28s -> 17584.60s]  do the social media thing. I don't tweet that. I don't like Facebook that.
[17585.48s -> 17594.81s]  How do I keep up with the new memes? You guys. I see what it is. Somebody writes it and then I type
[17594.81s -> 17598.89s]  it into Google and I find out what it is. And then I make references to it and I look like I'm in
[17598.89s -> 17608.62s]  with a hip crop. You know. Yes it will happen. I'm just. I know. I know. I'm bad. Mostly lost.
[17608.62s -> 17613.90s]  Thanks for 250. Jerma, you ever heard of a razor? It's a nice modern invention that can help with
[17613.90s -> 17624.50s]  that shit all over your face. And that's the show. And that's the show. Thank you TV. That's
[17624.50s -> 17629.99s]  thank you TY Towns for the five dollars. Had to give some bits for the doom house slayer.
[17630.71s -> 17638.54s]  You're funny Jerma. I think that was more fun than funny. But it was still fun. Maybe you thought
[17638.54s -> 17646.62s]  it was fun. Glad you did. Thank you for the five dollars. Freudian Weapon 250. Happy Friday. Can't
[17646.62s -> 17651.53s]  wait for more Disassembly Shunen against tomorrow night. We will go live tomorrow night. Probably
[17651.53s -> 17664.23s]  on the same time. And we will keep it. Keep it going. I will see you tomorrow. But thank you.
[17664.23s -> 17667.83s]  Something or other. Thanks for the 250. Heard about the sweet deal with Nintendo for the new
[17667.83s -> 17678.34s]  game on the SNES. Looking forward to it. Jerma Quest. Sometimes big things come in compact
[17678.34s -> 17687.48s]  packages. Thank you for that. Fender McBender. Thanks for the three dollars. Did you hear about
[17687.48s -> 17696.90s]  that comedian who died from a heart attack on stage? And no one realized it because they
[17696.90s -> 17703.88s]  thought it was a bit. That's horrifying. Yeah that's fucking horrifying. That's terrible.
[17704.44s -> 17719.03s]  Um that sucks. I can't even imagine how fucked up that would be. You think it might be like part
[17719.03s -> 17735.45s]  of a joke or a bit? Damn. Yeah that's. That just makes you feel terrible. But how long
[17735.45s -> 17759.98s]  ago did it happen? When was it? Was it recently? Jesus. Yeah that's scary shit. But yeah you just
[17759.98s -> 17774.36s]  gotta. You just gotta be careful. At some point maybe um. Did I call level up plunge? No not yet.
[17775.08s -> 17782.98s]  That's kind of on the plan though for the summer. It was years ago. Not yesterday. Oh well regardless
[17782.98s -> 17790.79s]  still that still sucks. But thank you for the three dollar spender. Uh Peek-A-Banana 250. Hey
[17790.79s -> 17793.91s]  Jerma my friend wants to know what the paint color of your walls are because he wants to paint.
[17794.79s -> 17814.26s]  He wants that paint color for his place. Um Sand 3 I think. Thank you. Hey Flugboy. 250 from Flugboy.
[17814.26s -> 17823.14s]  They say toro-roo-roo-roo. Hello boss Jeremy. Does want to know you do great things for my guy.
[17823.14s -> 17827.46s]  You do great things my guy. My mood is always automatically switched to cheerful when you start
[17827.46s -> 17837.45s]  streaming. Mosh moshi. Have a good night. Well thank you. I'm glad that you feel that way.
[17838.46s -> 17845.70s]  Thanks for the 250. Stick around there's more to see. Uh Mark Shinobi. Thanks for the five dollars.
[17845.70s -> 17851.38s]  Hey Jerma where is Sekiro on your top from software games and can you list your top five
[17851.38s -> 17856.98s]  from software games? I'm about to play all of them because I hate myself. Uh love you bro never missed
[17856.98s -> 17862.58s]  a stream. Thank you. That's that's a I can't believe that you've never missed a stream. That
[17862.58s -> 17870.84s]  there's a lot of times a lot of hours. But uh Sekiro is underneath Bloodborne and it's underneath
[17870.84s -> 17877.72s]  Demon's Souls. So I think the total list from least favorite to most favorite is
[17878.44s -> 17892.81s]  Dark Souls 2, um Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Demon's Souls, Sekiro, Bloodborne. That's where they
[17892.81s -> 17904.47s]  stand. No no no no no no no. I yes yeah Sekiro is above. I think Sekiro might be like tied.
[17905.19s -> 17911.03s]  Yeah let me I gotta do it again. I gotta like think about it. Okay Dark Souls 2 is my I still
[17911.03s -> 17916.47s]  liked it but it was not as fun as the other ones I think. Dark Souls 2 is the bottom. Uh Dark Souls
[17916.47s -> 17922.71s]  3 mainly because I just had gotten over the Bloodborne craze and it was like oh I want more
[17922.71s -> 17928.25s]  Bloodborne and this was kind of like fast like Bloodborne but it wasn't um I wasn't like a big
[17928.25s -> 17934.82s]  fan of the areas in Dark Souls 3. Something about them there was only a few areas that I really
[17934.82s -> 17946.79s]  really liked. Then Dark Souls 1 and Sekiro are probably tied just because Dark Souls 1 was just
[17946.79s -> 17952.28s]  you know it's it was so interesting. I would still probably put Sekiro over Dark Souls 1
[17953.91s -> 17957.51s]  because this there's a lot of shit in Dark Souls 1 that kind of like is unfinished.
[17958.79s -> 17963.67s]  Rushed a little. There's two of those areas felt very I think they even by the admission of From
[17963.67s -> 17969.61s]  Software were kind of thrown out as fast as they could but I would probably put Sekiro a hair above
[17969.61s -> 17975.85s]  Dark Souls 1 and then Demon's Souls and then Bloodborne. Bloodborne is if Demon's Souls is
[17975.85s -> 17980.81s]  here and Sekiro is here like oh and like Dark's Demon's Souls, Sekiro, Dark Souls 1 are all like
[17980.81s -> 17988.09s]  right here. Dark Souls 3 is like down here. Dark Souls 2 is down here. Bloodborne is all the way
[17988.09s -> 17995.11s]  up here. You can't even see it. It's off the fucking chart. Somebody said Jello arm. I'm fucking 33.
[17995.11s -> 18010.12s]  Okay I'm not like 20. I'm not like I'm not 20. Okay I'm 33. I'm not 20. God damn it. That's why
[18010.12s -> 18015.18s]  I never have a camera ever because I would look over and I'll see Jello arm and it'll throw off
[18015.18s -> 18032.01s]  my entire night. I'll be like, you don't look a day over four. Thank you. That means a lot.
[18032.57s -> 18039.82s]  Tweet the fight. I have to like link it to my Twitter which drunk me was not going to figure
[18039.82s -> 18048.31s]  that out so I'll figure it out. But thank you to Mark Shidobi. Hopefully that answers your question.
[18049.11s -> 18052.71s]  Bloodborne's number one. Garfield the Monday killer. Two dollars and fifty cents.
[18054.98s -> 18059.86s]  Gig Garfity goo. Here comes Garferoni with a load of funny bits for you in a wheelbarrow.
[18060.42s -> 18065.62s]  Just gonna dump it right over here for you. Do you like me yet? Garp craves approval. Are you
[18065.62s -> 18074.71s]  looking forward to Shrek 2 remake? Why would they remake Shrek 2 before Shrek 1? Do you think
[18074.71s -> 18080.46s]  Garfield will be a part of it? I'll be voicing Shrek and Donkey. Tell Lord director of 21 Jump
[18080.46s -> 18084.54s]  Street is working on the same project as Garfield since we agreed to do a scene. Would Jerm be
[18084.54s -> 18088.14s]  interested in doing a part in the film? Maybe a three second camera. My favorite part about
[18088.22s -> 18094.70s]  all the Garfield bits is in like a full two like almost full paragraph of just word soup.
[18095.58s -> 18100.78s]  There's a there's like three lines of a question you know. Okay so we have like a paragraph of
[18100.78s -> 18106.70s]  word soup and then are you excited for Shrek 2 remake? There's always something there. There's
[18106.70s -> 18116.20s]  always like substance there. So I don't I didn't even know that existed Garfield. Thank you for
[18116.20s -> 18129.43s]  the 250. He's got a yeah he's got a world of lore that he has. The Garfograph sandwich technique
[18129.43s -> 18134.82s]  is just it's passed on for generations of Garfields. Guys I hate to tell you this and people are gonna
[18134.82s -> 18141.06s]  maybe maybe this is a sad thing to say. Gar Garfield's cat he's been around for like 60 years.
[18141.06s -> 18153.66s]  Cats don't live 60 years. There's been like five or six Garfields. I don't cats only live like
[18153.66s -> 18170.52s]  15, 16, 20 plus maybe years. It's been like three or four of them. Are you insinuating that Garfield
[18170.52s -> 18179.80s]  can die? I'm insinuating that an animal a cat which is what Garfield is does not live on record.
[18179.80s -> 18187.90s]  I don't think there's never been a cat on record that has lived past 28 years old or 30. Even if
[18187.90s -> 18194.52s]  that cat even if Garfield was the most highly living cat in the history of the world he still
[18194.52s -> 18204.94s]  has been from two or three. Oh what about SpongeBob? SpongeBob is a sponge that's they live forever.
[18208.18s -> 18214.58s]  Oh no my my my cup oh it's only got like 15, 20, 30. No no what are you talking about?
[18222.33s -> 18230.86s]  Like Turtle? There's a couple of Turtle characters. Who's a popular Turtle character? Did that? He'll
[18230.86s -> 18240.02s]  be around for 150 years. Franklin the Turtle. Yeah Franklin the Turtle is like 40. He's got like 60
[18240.02s -> 18248.86s]  or 70 to 80 more years left to go. The Ninja Turtles. Oh that's right the Teenage Mutant Ninja
[18248.86s -> 18258.33s]  Turtles. They're gonna be eating pizza and cracking some skulls for like another 100 years.
[18259.13s -> 18283.26s]  That's why they got bought out by Disney. Viacom. So they got bought out by Viacom.
[18285.50s -> 18288.46s]  He's checking his Twitch stocks. I don't even fucking want to look at those.
[18292.36s -> 18296.04s]  But only a few more bits to go. Thank you Garfield. We're just poking fun at you. We're
[18296.04s -> 18301.27s]  just kidding around. Don't worry. We all love you. Don't worry. We're just we're just playing.
[18301.27s -> 18310.23s]  We're just playing around with the idea that you probably died six times. But thank you. Thank you
[18310.23s -> 18315.51s]  Jack. Jack you jacked the Mac for the five dollars. Jeremy my grandma passed away today
[18316.47s -> 18338.47s]  due to a banana experiment. I don't know what that means. I don't know if it's serious.
[18341.69s -> 18355.48s]  I'm sorry to hear that. Sorry to hear that. If that's sorry for your loss. If that's you know
[18355.48s -> 18384.57s]  thank you for the five dollars. Wow. Why the fuck do you look like that? You know what I've got to
[18384.57s -> 18391.94s]  fucking put this up here because I'm gonna hold this because like this is like this is my proof
[18391.94s -> 18397.46s]  that like I've got a headset here. Okay you ready? So here I'm like I just got out you know.
[18398.71s -> 18404.95s]  Hey man you uh having some trouble with your VR headset? So then if you come to the stream and
[18404.95s -> 18411.82s]  you didn't you didn't mean you weren't here before you're just like oh okay just um all right where
[18411.82s -> 18420.89s]  were we? Mostly lost. Oh I got some like mouth problems. Don't bite your lips. Uh thanks for the
[18420.89s -> 18425.29s]  250 mostly lost. On the subject of paint colors I've always said the one guaranteed job for
[18425.29s -> 18433.19s]  English majors is coming up with names for paints. Yeah like there's like a light green and it's like
[18433.19s -> 18447.46s]  springtime sea cucumber or something. That's true. Sand free. I'm not an English major though.
[18447.46s -> 18452.10s]  That's I mean you can make fun of me all you want but I that's I'm not an English major.
[18452.90s -> 18464.84s]  Are you an angry guy? I don't I don't think so. Uh but thank you mostly lost. Thank you to all
[18464.84s -> 18469.80s]  Mew for the three bucks. I cannot believe that so many people come out to watch you take apart
[18469.80s -> 18475.72s]  things in a virtual reality. I mean to think technologies come this far. Next thing you know
[18475.72s -> 18481.40s]  everyone and their grandma are going to have a oma. I'm not going to do that. I I know all the
[18481.40s -> 18490.52s]  tricks. I know all the tricks. I'm not going to say it. Thank you for the uh three dollars.
[18491.48s -> 18501.59s]  Hey bop beep thanks for three bucks. Appreciate it. It's uh oh he's going to puke. It's a youtube
[18501.59s -> 18525.21s]  link. Faith of the heart? Enterprise team? What is this? There's a song? I've got faith of the heart.
[18525.21s -> 18536.14s]  I don't I don't know what this is. I've never heard it. Uh thanks for the link. It's not another
[18536.14s -> 18549.46s]  Garfa graph. Yes there is. Hey uh gibbler thanks for the five dollars. Any plans to check out
[18549.46s -> 18554.81s]  outward? It's like Kenshi mixed with breath of the wild just came out on steam. Probably not.
[18555.90s -> 18560.06s]  Not in the immediate future here. There's so many other things that are going to come
[18560.06s -> 18565.56s]  first. Uh italics played it already and he was telling me about it. I'm not sure it's something
[18565.56s -> 18573.54s]  that I don't know if it's something I want to do. But yeah I'm not going to 100% rule it out,
[18573.54s -> 18582.89s]  but I'm not going to 100% rule it in either. So when's the next emote contest? I don't I don't
[18582.89s -> 18590.55s]  know. I don't have a plan in the moment for it, but that's my stance. Uh sticks renegade thanks
[18590.55s -> 18594.39s]  for the two dollars 55 cents. Thank you sticks. You've heard of the comb stream. Now this spring
[18594.39s -> 18600.12s]  get ready for the shave stream. Seriously shave on stream. No no I'm not going to shave on stream.
[18600.44s -> 18608.09s]  I'm not no no way. Hey pika banana thanks for the 250 german. You might have thought I was joking,
[18608.09s -> 18612.57s]  but my friend is actually now going to paint his room sand free. Thanks for answering the question.
[18613.29s -> 18619.00s]  I hope that's the correct color because I made that up. So here look look look I'll get look.
[18619.56s -> 18629.88s]  Let me give you a hand here. I'm gonna help you. Let me give you a hand. Just bring this into
[18629.88s -> 18660.26s]  Home Depot. Take a screenshot and just like bring that into Home Depot. Yeah ask him for this. You
[18660.26s -> 18684.06s]  got it? Wait I'll make it smaller. So get like a good shot of that and then get that in. Pretty
[18684.06s -> 18690.33s]  good poster. Bring that in and just ask him what he thinks. Ask him what he thinks about that. Hey
[18690.33s -> 18711.94s]  what do you think about this? I'm just gonna keep it like this. We're almost done. I can't fix it.
[18711.94s -> 18727.06s]  It's too hard. Ask him what he thinks about this. Wait hold on. All right um we had uh Garfy the
[18727.06s -> 18733.80s]  Monday killer 250. You've you're mistaken Jerm. I died seven times. How have you died seven times?
[18733.80s -> 18740.28s]  Garf is currently on his eighth life. I was a cave cat and got crushed by an odysseus rex frozen in
[18740.28s -> 18746.36s]  ice as a viking garf. Shot on the chest as a private eye garf. Stretched apart by a taffy
[18746.36s -> 18752.76s]  puller as three stooges routine garf. Transformed into a dog in the lab and then died shortly after
[18752.84s -> 18757.56s]  with problems of the mutation. Died a peaceful death in a rainbow fun land and the seventh one
[18757.56s -> 18771.83s]  was an immortal cat demon that got bored and died. He's eight. Thank you. Jerma lied about
[18771.83s -> 18778.97s]  Minecraft VR with five WDD subs. Thank you the five subs. I'm looking right at you. I'm looking
[18778.97s -> 18794.06s]  right at you. Take this shit into Home Depot and say what do you think about this? You're a creep.
[18794.94s -> 18809.88s]  Yeah that's sand three. You got it. You're doing great. You figure it out. All right we're at the
[18809.88s -> 18818.23s]  end of the bits. Mostly lost cup work just came in. Three uh 250 from mostly lost. Well if you're
[18818.23s -> 18822.95s]  not going to shave on stream you better damn well shave off stream. I will not. I'm going to look
[18822.95s -> 18830.81s]  like this tomorrow. I don't want to. Maybe tomorrow. Hey the mad god thanks for three bucks. Any chance
[18830.81s -> 18835.93s]  you'll bring back some of the winners of previous rumbles like the pencil captain crunch. It'd be
[18835.93s -> 18840.81s]  cool to see these legends return and also a match between Dr. Oetker and Gabe Newell clash
[18840.81s -> 18847.53s]  of titans. Not sure if this sent twice or not. Good night chat. I would. It's just in the new.
[18847.53s -> 18859.77s]  I don't. Let's just fucking get this fixed. I look like a sicko. What am I doing? That's okay.
[18859.77s -> 18864.81s]  That's better. That's just too weird. I look like a fucking weirdo. I look like a weirdo.
[18870.01s -> 18879.45s]  Okay I would but the problem is uh wwe all the ones after 2k14
[18880.41s -> 18887.29s]  not very good. They weren't good with the creative characters. They you can't do as much crazy shit.
[18887.29s -> 18894.07s]  You can't really make captain crunch in those games now. The pencil is impossible to make in
[18894.07s -> 18898.31s]  any of the new ones and going back and making them on the old ones they're so hard to make.
[18898.95s -> 18903.19s]  When you get more than 10 20 30 wrestlers and you do like more than 10 layers some of those
[18903.19s -> 18907.03s]  characters took hours to make just because of the loading times so I would not go back.
[18909.46s -> 18914.26s]  It would be it's so hard to do that and it would make it even worse because I don't have the
[18914.26s -> 18920.74s]  PlayStation 3. I don't have that PlayStation 3 so the like 40 of 50 characters I made on that
[18920.74s -> 18925.54s]  2k14 they don't exist anymore. They're gone forever. That place I don't I'm not in possession of it so
[18925.54s -> 18930.18s]  I don't have to save file so I would have to remake everybody. It would take me like it would
[18930.18s -> 18940.44s]  take me a month to do that so making like 75 characters in a thing that takes like an hour
[18940.44s -> 18947.69s]  and a half to make a character with more than 10 20 layers unfortunately we're gonna have to just
[18947.69s -> 18952.89s]  let it let it uh I was gonna say rise we have to let it rise and I'll go get it I'll go get it
[18952.89s -> 18958.65s]  tomorrow no do you think we'll ever see another goofy wrestling game ever again probably not
[18958.65s -> 18965.05s]  because apparently simulations are more important than making weird characters and maybe that's just
[18966.17s -> 18973.96s]  maybe that's just we have to kind of fade out here and and let the default guy in underwear first
[18973.96s -> 18979.16s]  name last name versus default guy in underwear first name last name is more important than a
[18979.16s -> 18993.02s]  guy in a clown suit so I don't think they care anymore because I we need glue man you can still
[18993.02s -> 19002.20s]  make glue man still you can make glue man still just I've seen it a couple times in the chat
[19003.26s -> 19008.68s]  fix your camera before I fix my camera there's nothing wrong with it you didn't like those edges
[19011.38s -> 19022.97s]  yeah are we good are you good uh get a ps3 get to get him I don't know where it is I gave it to
[19022.97s -> 19036.33s]  somebody is it okay is this a parrot or is this me proving why I look so bad I feel like I'm holding
[19036.33s -> 19044.34s]  the dog like okay here's my dog guys yeah it's cute huh uh peek a banana five community subs
[19045.22s -> 19056.23s]  speaking of the subs let's get them on uh camera here let's put them up all the community subs
[19056.23s -> 19066.20s]  and all the new subs and old ones here they come right here three four five at least six
[19066.76s -> 19076.90s]  at least six thank you guys though for real thank you thank you thank you uh there are
[19076.90s -> 19084.66s]  still one or two more bits to do thank you jack the mac for the five dollars have you ever
[19084.66s -> 19089.78s]  been noticed in public before other than for charities or events happy friday I have been
[19089.78s -> 19096.44s]  noticed in public like twice very random occurrences they I don't think it'll ever happen again
[19098.87s -> 19103.56s]  but now it's happened usually happens at a convention but if I'm not at a convention
[19103.56s -> 19108.20s]  it's only happened like two or three times in almost 10 years so it doesn't really happen
[19108.20s -> 19118.60s]  that often it's still really interesting what it does though and then zulaski thanks for the 250
[19119.40s -> 19132.57s]  and they say they say check this out cream puff the cat was a domestic cat she was the oldest cat
[19132.57s -> 19139.21s]  ever recorded according to the guinness book world records when she died she was 38 years old
[19140.90s -> 19151.75s]  and then the same family had another cat that was 34 years old from the same family you got to figure
[19151.75s -> 19156.28s]  yeah I would that point I'd be like what what what were they eating you know that's insane
[19159.35s -> 19170.04s]  38 years old and then 34 that's that is impressive but thank you for the little fact there
[19170.60s -> 19173.56s]  and then we had the five community subs and peek banana and then finally at the very end
[19173.56s -> 19180.23s]  mass shinobi three dollars thanks for answering my question but in my humble opinion of course
[19180.23s -> 19186.71s]  without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view but also by looking into
[19186.71s -> 19191.91s]  this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one's views and trying to make
[19191.91s -> 19196.23s]  it objectified and by considering each and every one's valid opinion I honestly believe
[19196.23s -> 19205.64s]  that I completely forget what I was going to say that's it thank you for the three bucks
