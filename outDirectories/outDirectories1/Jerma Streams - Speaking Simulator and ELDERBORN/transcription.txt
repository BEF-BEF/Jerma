[1.66s -> 10.65s]  All right. God, I hate. That's the worst comment of the whole year, but somehow also the best one.
[11.45s -> 27.83s]  All right, got a uh water. Stay hydrated, right? So the plan is to do speaking stimulator.
[28.47s -> 35.14s]  That's what was voted for. That's what was- that's what people voted for.
[35.94s -> 47.74s]  Why don't we just play- okay, listen to me. Why don't we just play it for like 10 minutes or
[47.74s -> 52.54s]  something? And we'll figure it out after that. Like, you want me to veto this?
[55.80s -> 61.42s]  Should I- should I veto this game? I already bought it. What do I- I might as well just play
[61.42s -> 69.93s]  for like 10 minutes. Play it for five minutes. All right, I'm gonna play it for five minutes.
[76.12s -> 82.68s]  Who cares? You haven't streamed in a week. I streamed like three days ago.
[83.40s -> 100.70s]  I've streamed in a week? Just refund it on stream. Same difference. All right, let me just come back
[100.70s -> 111.00s]  here. Uh, we can get this off the screen. So I'm gonna play it for five minutes and then I'll give
[111.00s -> 115.56s]  you- I'll give you some of the- you know, let me see. What have I got for- for veto options here?
[116.52s -> 129.26s]  Let me take a look. What do we got? We got- all right. Oh, you know what? I got elderborn.
[129.26s -> 142.89s]  Elderborn looks like it's- I was gonna play elderborn anyways. All right, it's either gonna be
[142.89s -> 154.62s]  elderborn or- I'm not starting the surge, too, right now. All right, bear with me. I'm gonna
[154.62s -> 162.63s]  play speaking simulator for five minutes. Put a countdown. Elderborn is snooze. It is? It looks-
[162.63s -> 177.46s]  it looks pretty fun. I'm gonna open it. I'm just gonna try it. I'm just gonna try it. All right,
[177.46s -> 218.89s]  I'm trying it. I just wanna try it. I just wanna play
[219.05s -> 227.38s]  for a few minutes. I'm gonna change the- yeah, hold on. Counting paper clips? That's not correct.
[234.46s -> 251.70s]  Here. It's even in the title, guys. All right, help me. Who did this? How about we do, um- help
[251.70s -> 261.30s]  me? Tongue movement, click and drag, lips, eyes, and brows to smile. W A S D's tongue.
[270.10s -> 277.46s]  Sorry, but you are now alive. I hope with your condition- I thought I was gonna read it.
[278.76s -> 291.94s]  How about that infiltrate and destroy human society? Okay, so hair. Meal, food, one? This is
[291.94s -> 319.30s]  not very much specified. Chunk? What? I don't understand. Okay, this is you, a perfect human
[319.30s -> 327.29s]  replica, the peak of our engineering technology. Not this game. I know. Look at the title. Wink?
[327.29s -> 341.83s]  All right, let's go. Try the jaw mechanism. Look on your mouth and drag it down. Okay, that was
[341.83s -> 345.83s]  inspiring. You're very inspired. Very good, very good. Let- let- let this praise wash over you.
[346.55s -> 349.99s]  Good. Now that you're sufficiently motivated, you will learn to stretch and pucker your lips.
[350.71s -> 355.58s]  You can drag outwards from the lip center to stretch. Drag in towards the lip to pucker.
[357.21s -> 372.22s]  Okay. Activate tongue. Use W A S D to move up, down, left, and right.
[372.78s -> 390.18s]  Push the green buttons with your disgusting tongue muscle. Okay, I just did. Despite being an
[390.18s -> 394.58s]  unfeeling AI, I'm proud of you. You're ready to face real humans. So I have to talk? You have to
[394.58s -> 399.54s]  talk. Level one, the date. Can you stop playing now? Just read the title. Manager of human
[399.54s -> 403.54s]  resources, Karen, has asked us to meet at this human food dispensary. We do not know why.
[403.54s -> 406.34s]  Show caution. It is possible that they suspect we plan to destroy humanity.
[408.98s -> 410.42s]  Sorry I'm late. Traffic was terrible.
[425.67s -> 430.47s]  What button do I have to press?
[433.96s -> 442.90s]  Oh, I get it. Okay. I am glad we're doing it. Thank you. That knocked all my teeth out.
[442.98s -> 468.46s]  There's something going on here. Nothing is going on. I am just a normal person.
[468.46s -> 474.78s]  Okay, I got it. I think something's definitely going on. I think we both know that there's some
[474.78s -> 519.37s]  attraction here. Yeah. I don't understand. Say it. I got it. You have such a flirt. I love it.
[520.33s -> 523.37s]  Let's get a drink and you can tell me more about how you like me.
[524.33s -> 554.66s]  How many units currency are required to purchase two fermented ethanol beverages?
[558.38s -> 563.37s]  This game is me. Why have you been playing this game for six hours? I've not been playing this
[563.37s -> 586.38s]  for six hours. Let's look at the menu. Okay. Imagine playing this for six hours. It hasn't
[586.38s -> 611.82s]  happened. Please forgive my error in requesting mechanical maintenance fluid. It was merely a
[617.78s -> 624.14s]  Somebody likes this here. Somebody likes this. I know they do. All right. My tongue's fucking
[624.14s -> 632.95s]  fucked up. Come on. Say it. What a treat. Not only are you gorgeous, but you get a sense of humor too.
[632.95s -> 648.86s]  I'm going to have some fun with you. Aren't I? I am a fun human with many fun. Come on. Get it.
[650.25s -> 667.16s]  Touch it. I am an elegant mate. Got it. I was not expecting this to get so saucy so quickly. This
[667.16s -> 681.32s]  is going to be a great night. Incredibly normal. Even kind of cool. All right. Back to the base.
[682.97s -> 697.30s]  Upgrade the station. Let's do it. Pull out teeth. Why am I pulling my teeth out? What? What's this
[697.30s -> 713.75s]  for? Smile. Smile. Express your innermost feelings as if they exist. All right. Let's get it. Smile.
[717.54s -> 724.94s]  What else can I do? Left, right. Gain system control of your eyes. Okay. Sure. Now the game
[724.94s -> 737.75s]  got harder. Yeah. That is actually what's going on here. It's been 10 minutes. The office. Job
[737.75s -> 752.47s]  interview. Yes. Yes. It's actually. No. Hold on. It hasn't been 10 minutes. All right. You've been
[752.47s -> 756.31s]  working for a month. The great leader has summoned you into their office. Be on your guard. You must
[756.31s -> 760.71s]  secure this position. You're great to meet you in person. I've been reading your resume. I'm beyond
[760.71s -> 818.46s]  impressed. What? Look happy. Isn't that happy? Oh. Exit this game. No, no, no. Not yet. Please call
[818.46s -> 849.56s]  me Grant. All right. Well, let me at least like close face up. Pressing it. I'm pressing it. Why
[849.56s -> 866.78s]  can I not hit this? external matrix. Chad wants out. Just wait. I bought this. It's not even that.
[874.92s -> 898.36s]  It's a game where they charge. This game is ridiculous. All right. Just, just do whatever
[898.36s -> 911.02s]  the weird thing is. All right. We're going to open up elderborn. Okay, guys, we're going to open up
[911.02s -> 917.98s]  the game elderborn. Jump king. I'm not. What do you mean jump king? Don't make me play jump king.
[918.70s -> 923.98s]  What do you mean jump king? Don't say that. Why are people saying that? Don't do that.
[925.50s -> 934.57s]  It was fun. I told you it was going to be 10 minutes. I can't play jump king. I haven't played
[934.57s -> 945.37s]  it in so long and I'm going to be so fucked up. I can't do it. Let's try elderborn. If elderborn's
[945.37s -> 956.44s]  not fun, I'll play jump king. How's that sound? Rain world. What the hell is rain world?
[957.16s -> 976.25s]  Rain world? What is this? Rain world. He plays like a slug cat thing. No, not today. Not today. I
[976.25s -> 991.88s]  want to, I want to swing swords at people. Elderborn opening up right now. Speaking simulator.
[992.84s -> 1006.70s]  We got a wink. Hold on. Game capture. And here we go. I actually have wanted to play this for a
[1006.70s -> 1013.56s]  little while. This was on the list today. All right. Wait, wait, wait. You'll get your wink.
[1017.75s -> 1030.10s]  Two winks. All right. We got sound. Let's turn subtitles on. Ambient volume. A little bit lower.
[1030.10s -> 1038.81s]  Music volume. A little bit lower. Sound effects. Global volume. All right. Three. What? Do you see
[1038.81s -> 1059.85s]  my cheek? That's like a spasm. I'm spasming. Gameplay. Difficulty. Elderborn is fine. Elderborn.
[1059.85s -> 1065.69s]  That's fine. Auto aim. Disabled. Gore. Particles and decals. Crosshair. Enable. Dense indicator.
[1065.93s -> 1071.61s]  Hit value. Fine. Field of view. Let's get that up to at least like 90. 90. I don't want to puke.
[1073.05s -> 1076.25s]  Controls. Mouth sensitivity. We'll bring this down a little bit.
[1077.37s -> 1087.05s]  Let's take a look. Change the title. Oh, shit. Yeah. Hold on. Play it for like 10 minutes.
[1089.62s -> 1100.76s]  Uh, first per FPS. What the fuck do I even title this? Should I keep it playing this for 10
[1100.76s -> 1115.48s]  minutes and I'm out here for like two or three hours? How about Elderquop? Here. How does this?
[1115.48s -> 1124.17s]  This is better. So then people will come to the stream and they'll do the uptime and be like,
[1124.17s -> 1141.27s]  what the fuck? All right. Let's go. All right. I'm going to just ready. Let's get ready.
[1145.16s -> 1170.68s]  Right in the middle. This game looks fun. We've been told legends of the day that the sky has
[1170.68s -> 1177.40s]  fallen. The world filled with death and despair as the land of our ancestors turned to ash.
[1177.40s -> 1185.24s]  But the tribes, we survived. At the center of all destruction, a mighty city rose in the desert,
[1185.24s -> 1189.64s]  Yurmum. Feeding off the strange power flowing from the never-ending...
[1189.64s -> 1196.07s]  It's a webcam mic. It remained unconquered. A webcam mic. Relax.
[1196.63s -> 1203.83s]  Yurmum and its golden army was the bane of the realm for ages. The tribes toiled in shadow.
[1204.55s -> 1209.82s]  Its relentless grip enslaved and oppressed. It's just a little compressed because it was
[1210.46s -> 1215.10s]  big. They want to make it under like six gigs. United our tribes and led them against the city.
[1215.74s -> 1223.59s]  His name was Yannis, a hero anointed by elders, standing a giant among...
[1223.67s -> 1232.12s]  You making excuses? Yannis' warriors never returned, but the city fell silent.
[1233.64s -> 1238.04s]  Sealed shut. Dormant for centuries. But all of a sudden you guys care about voice acting?
[1238.92s -> 1243.08s]  Silent Hill 2 is some of your favorite game ever made. Our elders are the keepers of the past.
[1243.88s -> 1248.68s]  They tell us the city holds a great prize, the very secret of eternal peace.
[1248.68s -> 1253.08s]  Resident Evil 1 is like some of your guys' favorite game. You really care about voice work?
[1254.28s -> 1261.16s]  In every generation, a champion of the tribes is chosen by the elders. With their blessing,
[1261.16s -> 1268.68s]  they are set upon a holy pilgrimage to explore the city. The champion is decided in trial by
[1268.68s -> 1286.63s]  combat. I've mastered all my brothers and sisters. In this generation, the holy quest is mine.
[1287.59s -> 1295.11s]  Leaving the familiar desert sands behind me, I enter the Forbidden Caves. This is the only
[1295.11s -> 1302.87s]  remaining way to the sealed off city. No one returned from the pilgrimage. Yet there is no
[1302.87s -> 1310.07s]  fear in my heart as I stare into the darkness. Gripping my weapon, I step into the shadows,
[1310.07s -> 1313.11s]  and the shadows come alive.
[1366.12s -> 1379.21s]  Some mechanism is working nearby. Activate a fountain to save progress. Drinking from
[1379.21s -> 1382.49s]  an active fountain will heal you but also bring back slain enemies. Dark souls!
[1383.37s -> 1409.99s]  Fix the FOV? What's wrong with it? What? Was 93 too much for you? Make it higher.
[1413.56s -> 1417.56s]  Left shift to dash in any direction. You can perform attacks while doing so. Use this to
[1417.56s -> 1422.41s]  your advantage.
[1485.46s -> 1495.45s]  Pay attention to the icon. What's that dash? Okay, you can only do it for like one second.
[1500.55s -> 1508.50s]  That is the Dark Souls sound. That is the quake FOV. What are you talking about? What?
[1511.11s -> 1524.78s]  Do you want more? Left kick. Oh no, you're gonna make me f**king puke.
[1525.66s -> 1543.02s]  Oh, there's stuff in here. I want to change kick to... I'm gonna change kick to one of the
[1543.82s -> 1555.69s]  worst mouse ever buttons. Kick is not going to be F. It's going to be this button. Okay.
[1556.81s -> 1563.78s]  Use healing file. Okay, that's going to be this mouse button. Next weapon, that's fine. Quick
[1563.78s -> 1571.62s]  swap is fine. One-handed blades. Alpha one. Alpha two. Alpha three. Oh, spoiler. 270.
[1578.15s -> 1581.11s]  Gamer mouse. All right, let's go. Is this death? Do I die if I go in here?
[1581.75s -> 1590.74s]  This guy's got a shield. Mouse three to kick through your enemy defense. Watch for counters.
[1600.87s -> 1612.52s]  F**k. This isn't Rain World. No, and you know what? You know what? I ain't ever gonna play
[1612.52s -> 1639.78s]  Rain World. This might be useful. I ain't ever gonna play Rain World. No, I can jump up.
[1641.06s -> 1648.10s]  You weren't going to anyway. Maybe not. Maybe not. It depends.
[1650.15s -> 1656.04s]  That's key. Key fits. Open it. All right, here we go. First real test of the game.
[1663.22s -> 1674.41s]  I'm dead. I'm dead.
[1689.82s -> 1693.74s]  All right, I'm good. This door is open. Do I pick up souls or anything?
[1694.78s -> 1721.82s]  If you died in the undead asylum, give it a rest. Okay. All right, let's go.
[1721.82s -> 1733.61s]  Do I have eye frames if I dodge with this? Apparently not.
[1736.89s -> 1769.72s]  Die. Will you marry me? No, absolutely not. My girlfriend would have a real bad problem.
[1769.72s -> 1782.09s]  That one. Oh, there it is. Cover the souls? Got it. Five hundred and ten.
[1782.57s -> 1799.43s]  F.A. hands. Why? Interesting. Catacombs. I have a girlfriend. I'm not marrying somebody in chat.
[1803.43s -> 1811.24s]  Mouse four to heal yourself with the luminous file. All right. How many do I have? Just one?
[1819.32s -> 1821.16s]  I feel like I could get used to this and it'd be pretty fun.
[1831.43s -> 1841.45s]  This might be useful. Stop selling us on this game. I didn't do anything. Just playing.
[1842.33s -> 1861.51s]  It's all about the block. Here's the door. Is this too loud? I think it's a little too loud.
[1862.07s -> 1875.16s]  Not anymore. He's doing a gameplay voice. What's a gameplay voice? What's a gameplay voice? What
[1875.16s -> 1894.79s]  does that mean? Gameplay voice? I'm just fucking talking. I'm talking. Does it wink? Can't get this
[1894.79s -> 1916.46s]  open. That was actually mad. He's in undead asylum. Dying in undead asylum. No, I'm not.
[1919.03s -> 1944.68s]  E3 game trailer. Let me just enjoy this. Oh, it slows motions. This feels like Oblivion.
[1947.62s -> 1953.77s]  So what do I do with a full meter? All right. I'm going to start talking like this for the
[1953.77s -> 1957.05s]  rest of the game so people don't fucking say that I'm doing an E3 voice.
[1961.22s -> 1966.90s]  No, shit. That is an E3 voice. Look, I'm a relatable guy from a city. I'm from Boston.
[1966.90s -> 1982.71s]  I'm relatable to you. No, that's worse. All right. Just do Bugleberry. No, I don't want
[1982.71s -> 2001.74s]  3,000 people to leave. Do the auto voice the whole time. That is E3. How is that less E3?
[2002.94s -> 2014.71s]  Challenge completed. What is that? Challenge completed. What the hell?
[2015.75s -> 2026.70s]  Uh, might, speed, and resilience. Your attacks and skills deal more damage. Wait,
[2026.70s -> 2032.12s]  can I put points into this? You move faster and your attacks are more fast. You have additional
[2032.12s -> 2058.92s]  hit points. Claim reward? Okay, I claimed it. How do I use it? I claimed it apparently.
[2060.44s -> 2067.74s]  Go back to universal paperclips. I beat it. I completed it. I beat the whole game.
[2068.70s -> 2091.99s]  This stream feels longer than 20 minutes. No, it hasn't. It's been, I don't know, like 15 minutes
[2091.99s -> 2106.50s]  so far total. Should I even be opening these? I have like a max bar. What's it doing?
[2111.80s -> 2117.66s]  I regen health for the full bar. Oh, that's kind of cool.
[2118.70s -> 2127.18s]  Somebody said super frog. Speaking of super frog, uh, got something. I got something.
[2128.14s -> 2159.70s]  I'm gonna die. Get out of my life, please. All right. Now what? Got candy. It does have candy.
[2161.67s -> 2171.37s]  200 essence. Do I have a super frog? Uh, I have something coming up soon.
[2171.93s -> 2183.45s]  You guys really gonna like? Don't kill me, please. The fuck just hit me? I have a game compilation
[2183.45s -> 2201.34s]  that was highly requested. I got it. The orange box. I finally got the orange box. I'm trying to
[2201.34s -> 2221.88s]  see what like the big hype about it is. Nothing in there. Fuck. This area kind of sucks. Finally
[2221.88s -> 2229.21s]  got rain world. People want to see you finish jumping. That's not gonna happen. I've been out
[2229.21s -> 2233.05s]  of the game for so long. It would take me like a whole, typically like three days to get back
[2233.05s -> 2240.62s]  to where I need to be to beat the DLC. I can't do it. No way. I got to, I got to where I wanted
[2240.62s -> 2256.47s]  to get to. Shit. Oh, fuck. This is bad. This is bad. Just kill him for me, please. Kill him.
[2259.29s -> 2288.39s]  Oh, Jesus. Come on. Here again. Keep going up. Irma the turtle. Yeah, I'm level one. Of course
[2288.39s -> 2293.37s]  I'm going to be a turtle at level one. I know. What do you think? I am like level 30. I don't
[2293.37s -> 2319.18s]  want to lose this. If I lose, I'm going to move on to Jump King. Can I throw something? Missed.
[2320.57s -> 2328.65s]  Missed again. Oh, that was actually pretty cool. Whoa. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of
[2328.65s -> 2338.26s]  people. This game looks like Sea of Thieves. Stop. Don't make me laugh right now. I don't want to
[2338.26s -> 2355.56s]  lose. There's so many people here. Oh, fuck. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I'm okay. I haven't fallen.
[2356.82s -> 2367.62s]  Oh, boy. Come on. That was pretty good reaction to anything. Sea of Fucking Thieves. Come on, man.
[2368.90s -> 2381.21s]  Oh, boy. Still alive. No, no, no. I want him to die. I want him to die. That's what you sound like
[2381.21s -> 2410.63s]  right now. How much further does this go? I probably have like six million HP. Oh,
[2411.83s -> 2430.90s]  what is that? Is that alive? Can I upgrade? I probably can. I hope so. Activate the thumb.
[2430.98s -> 2436.01s]  Made it to a fountain. Tab to level up. Leveling up is possible when the icon below is displayed.
[2437.34s -> 2448.09s]  Okay, let's heal and then let's level up. What should I do? Speed? Speed, damage, or health?
[2448.09s -> 2462.76s]  What do you guys think? Speed. One percent. Two percent. Three percent. Five percent faster. I'm
[2462.76s -> 2478.62s]  five percent faster. Didn't I claim this already? All right, I'm good. I got the fountain. I've
[2478.62s -> 2494.12s]  leveled up. Let's keep going up. It's probably a boss right here. You guys are going to see me
[2494.12s -> 2500.44s]  play this boss and then all of a sudden like this steam page is going to get like 600 people new
[2500.44s -> 2505.24s]  traffic and there's going to be like 350 fucking new sales. It's going to be like,
[2505.24s -> 2525.59s]  oh, that was awesome. I'm going to fucking beat this before he does. There's a lot more people
[2525.59s -> 2540.58s]  here. Dude, it's an ad. It's not an ad. Rain World now. I've never even heard of this game.
[2541.06s -> 2565.51s]  Oh, shit. Don't. It's a bad game. I don't know anything about it. There's no iframes.
[2576.39s -> 2597.32s]  Who the fuck said that? You got the logs. How do they not block that? Are you kidding me? Come on.
[2597.32s -> 2616.82s]  Do it. All right. Can I kick you off? What you? Hold on. You stay planted? What are you talking
[2616.82s -> 2635.66s]  about? Do Rain World or I leave? We'll see you later. I'm not playing Rain World right now.
[2644.36s -> 2649.40s]  Get rainers. Get ready to riot. Where did this even come from?
[2659.83s -> 2668.84s]  Do I even have stamina bar? I don't think I do. All right. There's a shitload of people up here.
[2671.48s -> 2674.68s]  You didn't want to play it. So chat now is doing this because they want to be funny.
[2677.35s -> 2692.34s]  Play right. All right. I don't back up that much. I'm going to die. Wait till he swings.
[2693.61s -> 2698.73s]  Gameplay voice. All right. One, two. There it is. Opportunity comes up. Nice job.
[2699.77s -> 2704.73s]  There's a couple of swings. Do it again. Gameplay voice. Okay. One, two. No, let's try to get that
[2704.73s -> 2734.22s]  one. Tuber voice. I'm the ultimate tuber. Name me a better tuber. Come on. Can you?
[2734.94s -> 2751.46s]  Don't you remember Face Camp Fortress 2? I do. All right. This is somebody said Sea of Thieves. No,
[2751.46s -> 2774.82s]  this is like Riddle Hollow and Outer Wilds. Oh, no. What's it called? What's that one called
[2774.82s -> 2791.10s]  with the black hole in the bottom? A Kinect game. Stop. All right. More speed. Sure.
[2791.10s -> 2795.90s]  Successfully parry a projectile to launch it at the nearest foe. Spend less time chasing after
[2795.90s -> 2802.65s]  essence. It will fly towards you on its own. I mean, that sounds, that sounds pretty good.
[2809.62s -> 2814.66s]  So when I parry now, it'll launch at somebody. All right. That's cool. That's pretty cool. Let's
[2814.66s -> 2835.88s]  keep going. This doesn't open. Let's test it. Shoot at me. Shoot an arrow. Is that not a parry?
[2843.83s -> 2851.40s]  That's a projectile, right? The parry. All right. Where am I supposed to? Oh, there's a lever over
[2851.40s -> 2863.99s]  there. Okay. Am I supposed to jump and get this? No. Oh my God. Hold on. Fall off. No, there's no
[2863.99s -> 2909.78s]  fall joke here. All right. I'm ready. Just pull the lever. Shit. I actually have to fight my way
[2909.78s -> 2920.02s]  down there. Oh, come on. What is this? A fighting game. Jump King now. No, I'm not playing Jump King.
[2920.02s -> 2937.96s]  That was a lie. So why is that? Am I not parrying correctly? I don't get it.
[2938.68s -> 2966.63s]  How's that on a parry? It's not. I'm very confused by that. This game is supposed to have music. I
[2966.63s -> 2972.66s]  think it's playing. I need a different weapon to parry. Oh, somebody's running behind me somehow.
[2982.26s -> 2997.16s]  Open this fucking door, please. Eight. Oh, down there. Come on. That door now opens.
[2997.88s -> 3008.22s]  Does that stay open? Can I save the game? This is pretty cool for on PS2.
[3009.18s -> 3028.42s]  All right. That's a level up right there. Let's go. Speed. Okay. I don't have enough essence.
[3029.24s -> 3035.91s]  All right. I'm 10% faster. I can do more damage next. Nothing stops the rain. I'm going to open
[3035.91s -> 3043.62s]  up rain world and people are going to be like, I don't like this. This is what's going to happen.
[3043.62s -> 3054.81s]  Character sheet. All right. Kill count. 83. Time played. More than I've said I was going to stream.
[3055.91s -> 3082.30s]  Chests open. What should I get to a boss? What do you mean no bosses? Let me just get to a boss
[3082.30s -> 3089.56s]  first before everybody freaks out. I mean, I'm not getting the essence for this, but whatever.
[3090.28s -> 3102.18s]  Easy to get rid of them. This game's too violent for me. I'm sorry. This is what we're doing,
[3102.18s -> 3113.99s]  though. Need more enemy variety. Well, it hadn't been very long. Really? Breaking this will require
[3113.99s -> 3134.76s]  some heavier tool. Oh, great. Can I go anywhere else? Wink. If you speak while playing a game,
[3135.88s -> 3144.02s]  an E3 presenter. I can't even talk. Otherwise, I'm an E3 presenter.
[3159.78s -> 3170.06s]  Guys, I can go this way. I can go this way. Remember, if you say the thing you're doing,
[3170.70s -> 3183.38s]  you're in. Blame the E3 gameplay fucking demos. It's nothing to do with me. Pick up.
[3186.04s -> 3202.23s]  Ooh, and a block. Ooh, that looks like a parry. That's a parry. That's absolutely a parry.
[3203.03s -> 3228.89s]  Wink scam. You only got like three more days on that, by the way. Well, I didn't die,
[3228.89s -> 3243.80s]  so that's good. Sell them now. I don't even need to jump. You just go, you walk up these
[3244.52s -> 3249.50s]  and you get 5,000 points in three days. Probably. It'll probably be all right.
[3250.46s -> 3261.43s]  This is not... Oh, is this not a heavier tool? Wait, this is not what I was supposed to do?
[3266.71s -> 3295.48s]  Spear is not heavier than a sword. Well, okay. Refuge. I call this place a refuge with dark
[3295.48s -> 3307.50s]  sarcasm. It seems less dangerous than the fire pit below. Fire pit below. You got it. Dark sarcasm.
[3308.30s -> 3311.74s]  Tap right mouse button at the right time to parry. You can parry unblockable attacks.
[3315.19s -> 3317.83s]  Attacks marked with that icon cannot be parried. All right, nice.
[3320.89s -> 3334.09s]  That was fucking cool. That was really cool, actually. Are you gonna do something?
[3340.01s -> 3364.87s]  What? How is that not a parry? Nice parry. I thought it was. What? Okay.
[3367.11s -> 3398.20s]  Why did it work that time? He was slightly too early. That's all right.
[3399.16s -> 3406.06s]  All right, look for a tool. A heavy tool. Well, are they fighting each other?
[3407.26s -> 3442.92s]  It's a fucking scorpion down there. This is really confusing. So, is it gonna be later than this?
[3444.98s -> 3466.09s]  All right. Oh my God. Monka S. Minus 300 viewers. Monka S. Ah! I thought it was a set piece.
[3466.09s -> 3472.54s]  I thought it was a set piece. I thought it was a set piece. Oh well. I thought it was
[3472.54s -> 3496.31s]  calcified or something. I don't know. I didn't think it was alive. There's only 500 viewers left.
[3496.31s -> 3515.40s]  Shit. Fuck. I better play Risk of Rain. I better hurry up and get on that. Die here?
[3518.47s -> 3522.71s]  So, I'm gonna have to parry this. These scorpions are fucking scary. Here we go.
[3522.71s -> 3532.81s]  Parry. That happens very quickly. Holy shit. I'm not supposed to be down here. I don't think I'm
[3532.81s -> 3547.56s]  supposed to be down here. Holy shit. I'm not supposed to be down here. There's so many
[3547.56s -> 3560.22s]  fucking scorpions. I'm not supposed to be down here. I'm hiding. Is there a fountain?
[3564.78s -> 3601.40s]  I'm definitely not supposed to be here. I need to find a tool. Okay. Well, I'm up here. What? So,
[3601.40s -> 3606.84s]  am I not supposed to go down this way? I don't understand. I died in like one hit down here.
[3608.12s -> 3649.98s]  Find a tool. That's better. I'm almost dead again. Did that guy just spawn? That was weird.
[3655.35s -> 3672.97s]  Wink scam? God. It's getting deleted. Use them now. It's gone in like in less than 24 hours.
[3686.86s -> 3700.71s]  I'm absolutely not supposed to be going down here. I'm already dead. Is there a different way to go
[3700.71s -> 3723.61s]  besides? Hold on. Play funny jump game. No. No. There's a fountain right there. Why? I'm just
[3723.69s -> 3806.94s]  keeping it on. I didn't press any button. Stab each other. I killed it. All right. Now what?
[3807.50s -> 3817.66s]  You don't have to parry every attack. If I don't, I'm going to get hit and die. I'll be dead.
[3831.75s -> 3838.25s]  Watch out for that fire. Don't touch it. Give me that. Say the funny word. What's the funny word?
[3838.25s -> 3846.70s]  What do you want me to say? Maybe getting hit and dying is a good thing. I don't think so.
[3849.58s -> 3853.02s]  Like five people said they were coordinating in like a discord.
[3853.82s -> 3859.82s]  Play this rain game and now all you guys are latching on to it. Don't get manipulated.
[3884.23s -> 3887.03s]  Play Wayne's World? Am I reading that wrong?
[3889.88s -> 3912.17s]  Somebody say play Wayne's World for Super Nintendo? Okay. Still going good. Hello board?
[3912.17s -> 3914.71s]  Somebody's shooting arrows at me. From where? Oh, over there.
[3915.99s -> 3934.74s]  Wait, I can. That hurt. Never mind. Wayne train leaving the station.
[3937.62s -> 3953.86s]  Get out of here. What was that fucking hit box? Am I like 60 feet long?
[3953.86s -> 3969.62s]  I don't even fight these things. I don't even worth doing that.
[3982.62s -> 3987.21s]  Like King's Quest? That's not a bad idea. King's Quest is pretty fun.
[3987.85s -> 3994.36s]  People could like talk shit and stuff and we could have like a fun back and forth about like
[3994.36s -> 3999.72s]  what do I do? What do I do with the bubblegum? Do I combine the bubblegum with the stick?
[3999.72s -> 4002.76s]  And everyone's going to be like not like this fucking idiot. What are you doing?
[4004.76s -> 4041.59s]  Sounds like fun. All right. I'm not done yet. I'm not done until I get to a boss
[4041.59s -> 4066.79s]  and then I uninstall the game. Oh sick fountain. Let's go. I haven't leveled up yet.
[4069.18s -> 4081.86s]  Dude's sick. Dude's sick. He thinks there are bosses. There is. There really isn't.
[4082.50s -> 4099.16s]  Need a tool. Oh, there's a key. Let me get this. All right. Now I get the key to that door that's
[4099.16s -> 4110.66s]  over there. I can level up. There's another one down there, but not worth it. All right.
[4110.66s -> 4121.16s]  Now let's go open the door that's over here. Where was it? Down? Where was it over here?
[4121.96s -> 4133.85s]  I can't get back up here, can I? I think I have to drop down. I guess I gotta go down here.
[4139.48s -> 4150.78s]  Fire pit. Interesting. Okay. Interesting. Let's see if I can kill these guys. Oh,
[4150.78s -> 4155.02s]  there's three of them. All right. I'm ready for. Hey, here we go.
[4160.12s -> 4175.56s]  Um, this is, this is like fucking a hundred over here. Who cares? I got a door to open.
[4180.74s -> 4211.05s]  Oh, come on. Come what? What? Give me a break. Why? Where was this door? It was back here,
[4211.05s -> 4225.13s]  wasn't it? Do I still have the key? Thank God. Somebody's probably behind me too.
[4225.13s -> 4232.49s]  Everybody careful. I told you there was bosses in this game. What did you? I told you there was a
[4232.49s -> 4262.55s]  boss. Give me the hammer. Oh, I got a hammer now. Game just got way better. Okay. I can. Okay. So
[4262.55s -> 4274.54s]  now we go. I'm going to go back to where that down here, right over. Will you please? Why don't I
[4274.54s -> 4293.10s]  put this up to my face? Me mad? Who? Who is over there? What's the name? Why are you so? Why are
[4293.10s -> 4299.42s]  you mad about them? What are you mad about? What's wrong? What's the matter? I'm going to
[4299.42s -> 4316.71s]  kill them all in one swing. Ready? Watch this. Close enough.
[4337.61s -> 4341.53s]  All right. This game just went up a fall letter grade because of this weapon.
[4343.56s -> 4357.61s]  Wham. You want rain world. Wham. You want rain world. Shit. Come on. Just hit one.
[4364.92s -> 4383.77s]  Why? No, don't activate it. Activate, activate, activate. Okay. Let's get up.
[4385.21s -> 4394.36s]  All right. Can I not get up from here? I think I'm stuck down here.
[4397.24s -> 4414.36s]  Can I not get back up from this way? 600 people left. It's my fault. No, that's, that's on them.
[4415.08s -> 4419.86s]  Guys, for all you know, 600 people just got like a fucking call and they had to get on a phone call.
[4419.86s -> 4423.46s]  They had to go to like the doctor or something or they were going to eat dinner or it was not
[4423.46s -> 4428.54s]  going to bed. You don't know it was my fault. I had nothing to do with it. 600 people just got a
[4428.54s -> 4440.20s]  phone call. I can't get, I cannot get back up here. Can I?
[4446.34s -> 4460.58s]  It hurts so much. Just play rain world. I'm going to open rain world like three weeks from now
[4461.46s -> 4470.60s]  and play the first five minutes and then delete the game. Can I not get out of here?
[4470.60s -> 4504.58s]  How do I get back around? Uh, wasn't there another one of those patches somewhere? I mean,
[4504.58s -> 4508.42s]  there were two walls. There was another wall I could break. I don't know where it is.
[4509.70s -> 4525.99s]  Over here. Over here. Back to that boss door. I don't even remember where the fuck it is.
[4526.95s -> 4533.50s]  They use the wrong fountain.
[4535.98s -> 4549.02s]  There ain't nothing down here. Well, let me go back this way. I have to go through here, right?
[4551.19s -> 4563.54s]  No, do I? Through here and back up around. Go up this way. Don't get killed by a fucking scorpion.
[4565.38s -> 4569.61s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Back up here.
[4570.49s -> 4576.90s]  Is that boss door thing? If I can make it by this without aggroing the whole room.
[4577.78s -> 4613.77s]  And you just, that was embarrassing. All right. All right. I've almost had enough. You died? I
[4613.77s -> 4626.86s]  know I died. What do you think? I don't have the same screen on as you. All right, pull these guys
[4627.26s -> 4683.82s]  out. Oh my God. Should I try to parry? All right. I just fucking annihilated this dude. Let's go.
[4701.29s -> 4706.82s]  All right. You know what? I don't even care. Let's just go. Like, what the fuck?
[4714.76s -> 4745.66s]  There's nothing even in here. Why is there a third guy? Shit. There's nothing even in here.
[4746.22s -> 4764.09s]  All right. I got to level up. I like sneak out of here and just check every crevice. Hold on.
[4764.89s -> 4775.56s]  All right. That counts as a boss. Is there a fountain up here?
[4784.66s -> 4798.39s]  Fuck. Oh my God. I'm in so much trouble now. Let me die. All right. Well, I know that my shit is
[4798.39s -> 4833.18s]  over there. It's a full level up worth of stuff. Okay. We're good. Oops.
[4853.94s -> 4860.90s]  It's a sticky key. Wait, why is sticky keys on? All right. I'm good. All right. I'm almost done
[4860.90s -> 4898.18s]  with this game. I wanted to play it. It's fun. I just mauled it into sticky keys. It's fun.
[4898.18s -> 4912.31s]  Quick. Get the fuck out of here. Sex is safe. Game over. We win? No, you don't win.
