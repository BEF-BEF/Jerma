[2.94s -> 29.03s]  Hello. Hi. How are you doing? What's going on? Explain yourself. Okay, fine. Guess I'll explain
[29.03s -> 36.54s]  myself. Uh, so I woke up today and I had a bad headache. Is it- I did the thing where you just
[36.54s -> 40.86s]  pop two Tylenol, go lie down in bed, and just like sit there and pray with your eyes closed.
[41.66s -> 46.62s]  Go in. Go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away. Well, you don't do-
[46.62s -> 57.02s]  that'll make your headache worse, but, um, yeah, I'm okay. It seems to have, uh, subsided a little,
[57.58s -> 65.10s]  but don't be too loud. I would like if everybody could please lower your volume a little bit.
[65.74s -> 75.34s]  I've got a headache today. Can you imagine going to a concert or going to a live event
[76.06s -> 80.25s]  and the person you're going to see comes out on stage and you're like cheering.
[80.97s -> 84.81s]  This person goes, hold on. Wait, wait, guys, guys, excuse me. I have a headache today.
[87.78s -> 91.30s]  If you could just kind of lower your volume and not be so excited.
[92.02s -> 97.11s]  And they do their whole routine. And every time that somebody, the crowd laughs,
[98.36s -> 106.46s]  like that big crowd laugh, it's just like, stop, stop. I told you guys, please get it together.
[107.10s -> 113.46s]  This is ridiculous. I'm going to leave. Hangover, Andy. I don't, I don't have a hangover. I didn't,
[114.10s -> 129.61s]  didn't drink anything. That would actually be pretty funny. Oh, I just get headaches.
[130.33s -> 140.78s]  I'm just a headache, Andy. I, uh, I've had an MRI of my brain, so there's nothing immediately
[140.78s -> 145.58s]  concerning. Apparently that this is ongoing for like a decade plus. So don't worry. I'm okay.
[146.30s -> 161.30s]  But today we've got some stuff going on. I'm going to play GeoGuessr on cam. That's right.
[161.38s -> 169.26s]  I'm going to be on camera today. And then we're going to play Dying Light 2 again with stir.
[169.26s -> 175.70s]  So play, play GeoGuessr for like, maybe like an hour or two. Maybe we'll see somewhere around like
[175.70s -> 180.42s]  four, four 30. We're going to ping stir and be like, Hey, ready to get back into the world
[180.42s -> 189.05s]  of Dying Light. He's going to go, yeah, dude. So let's go. I think we've spent enough time here.
[191.99s -> 200.98s]  Let me clear my throat. Let me take a sip of water. No cheating. How do you cheat at GeoGuessr?
[201.62s -> 209.69s]  I don't get it. Don't you have to just kind of guess where you are?
[210.33s -> 222.36s]  Would you guys progress in Dying Light at all? Well, um, kind of kind of, uh,
[225.08s -> 232.06s]  well, do I, we're not playing Dying Light yet. So we'll tell you about it after we didn't play
[232.06s -> 246.55s]  anymore. We may have progressed. We might have. You can't look up companies or addresses. Oh,
[246.55s -> 250.95s]  that's fine. I didn't do that anyways. No, we're just going to see if I can know where I am.
[254.34s -> 262.76s]  Let's go ahead and get it on the screen right now. Hold on. Let me click this. Wait, hold on.
[263.40s -> 268.97s]  GeoGuessr is a premium service now. Yeah. I already, I already bought it.
[269.61s -> 272.49s]  I saw the five minute thing and I was like, that's not going to work.
[278.50s -> 283.30s]  So we're, we're not limited to the five minutes and then 15 minutes.
[284.02s -> 290.55s]  Where's our a hundred community subs. I still can't figure out what's going on. So like I,
[290.55s -> 297.50s]  I am the process of trying to figure out why that's happening. So there's real debt on this
[297.50s -> 304.54s]  channel now that I have not paid yet. The jokey two billion debt thing is, was a funny joke,
[304.54s -> 310.52s]  but now it's real. I owe a hundred community subs that I haven't paid yet. I actually have,
[312.79s -> 319.34s]  uh, actually have a real debt that I have to pay. So I have not found a solution yet. I'm going to
[319.34s -> 325.61s]  figure that out very soon. I promise. Just keep it, add it to the tab. All right, here we go. You
[325.61s -> 343.86s]  ready? Oh, I had a crazy dream too. I'll tell you that it's fucked up. Can you see me? Okay. So
[343.86s -> 351.86s]  we're going to play GeoGuessr. It's going to be fun. Uh, I don't, this is all like a new menu.
[351.86s -> 363.86s]  I don't know what any of this is. What, what is all this stuff? Beard? Yeah. I have to shave.
[363.86s -> 369.75s]  It's getting bad. It's getting too long. Don't ask us. We're no, but yeah, look, this is like
[369.75s -> 378.63s]  a completely new website. I don't know. I don't get it. Explore mode, daily challenge, world famous
[378.63s -> 385.30s]  places. Should I just do world? What's like the regular one? Just do world. That's what I'm going
[385.30s -> 393.37s]  to do. This, this sound effects too. I'm going to hold on. Single player. Yeah. All right. Default
[393.37s -> 401.67s]  setting. No time limit moving around. Yeah. Start. You ready? I want to full screen this like this.
[401.67s -> 411.06s]  Yes. Okay. All right. Where the heck are we? That's my new series on Twitch. If you check it out,
[411.06s -> 416.18s]  you check out the title. The title of the stream is where the heck even are we guys? Let's go ahead
[416.18s -> 432.71s]  and start. Okay. Looks a little, looks a little industrial. I don't think, I don't think this is
[432.71s -> 441.30s]  North America. I want to take a guess right off the bat immediately. I would say it's somewhere
[441.30s -> 451.86s]  in Europe, either Europe or, I don't know, the default answer for everywhere. If you don't think
[451.86s -> 458.90s]  it's America is Russia, right? No, this doesn't look like a somewhere in Kentucky. It's Russia.
[458.90s -> 464.07s]  Like that's not, it's not, it's never is. I mean, it could be, wait, what was that sign?
[464.07s -> 478.22s]  I don't, wait, go back. How do I zoom in? It's just mouse scroll, right? What's that? What's that
[478.22s -> 497.48s]  say? Uh, I don't know what that says. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to say Italy. I think it's
[497.48s -> 516.60s]  somewhere in Italy. I think that was Italian. No, that's not, that's not Italian. Wait a minute.
[523.46s -> 532.55s]  Russia. This is Russia. That's Russia. That's Russian. I don't know. I don't know what language
[532.55s -> 539.67s]  that is. All right. It's, okay. It's not here. So let's go over here. I've been doing the thing
[539.67s -> 550.89s]  where I'm just holding the mug. Okay. Here. Let's keep going. All right. There's no time limit,
[550.89s -> 555.96s]  but I feel like that kind of should be. Maybe I should turn it on because eventually I'll figure
[555.96s -> 574.14s]  it out. Right. Okay. What does this say? I, I N A. Wait, what's that? Ineos. Wait, what? This is Japan.
[574.14s -> 584.60s]  This is, we're in Japan. What? No, that's, this can't, no, what? This is not Japan. What flag is
[584.60s -> 595.19s]  this? This is not, is that the Jap? That's not the Japanese flag. What is that? I don't know what
[595.19s -> 605.82s]  flag that is. Okay. Wait, it's probably like here. Of course this isn't fucking Japan. Am I stupid?
[605.82s -> 610.06s]  All right. I'm, I'm going to say, wait, they got the state puff marshmallow man over here.
[610.06s -> 624.46s]  What happened? What? I thought my screen got, why is there a bullet hole in my screen? I honestly
[624.46s -> 627.50s]  thought there was something wrong with my monitor for one second. I was like, why is there a fucking
[627.50s -> 639.93s]  bullet hole? What is that? It's a tree. All right. I get it. I, I'm going, I'm going, we're going
[639.93s -> 655.16s]  right here in Lida. I'm guessing. Let's go. It's not bad. Where was it? Slovenia. Okay. That wasn't
[655.16s -> 670.95s]  that bad or no Croatia. Okay. I mean, it was across the entire continent, but whatever. Okay.
[671.75s -> 685.80s]  Now this, this is a, this is the United States of America. Orange, Orange road. Keep left.
[689.83s -> 693.67s]  I feel like that sign needs to be a little bigger because it looks like it's been run over like
[693.67s -> 707.40s]  a hundred times. I feel like they need to make this a little more elaborate. I'm, hold on. I'm
[707.40s -> 718.02s]  thinking, I'm thinking we need to see some business or something here at Hearst golf range.
[720.95s -> 729.72s]  It's somewhere in the South, but is it though? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. Now
[729.72s -> 739.51s]  that we're looking at it for another minute, am I going to take a sip of this fucking coffee
[739.51s -> 743.59s]  already? I've been holding, how long has the streaming been live? I've been holding this
[743.59s -> 754.90s]  right here for 13 minutes and I haven't sipped out of it yet. What's that school zone? Eight to
[754.90s -> 767.72s]  nine, two, 30 to four, 40. Wait, does this say you can go 40 in a school zone? Isn't that too, way too
[767.72s -> 790.14s]  fast? 40? That's zooming in a school zone. Oh, I thought it was like 60 in a school zone. Holy shit.
[790.14s -> 796.33s]  All right. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this bus stop? This is,
[796.33s -> 807.16s]  it's probably, I think it's in the South. 40 miles per hour school zone. Where's the school?
[809.80s -> 813.72s]  Where's the school? N school zone was on this side of the road. Where is it? Is that a school?
[818.94s -> 829.42s]  Is that a school? Remember, you're pretending. I am not pretending. There's a flag right here,
[831.14s -> 845.54s]  but it's like folded over. I can't, I don't know what that says. That's Australia. I mean, yeah,
[845.54s -> 864.60s]  you don't know that. Wait, closing day and boarding college, pre-kindergarten to year 12.
[865.83s -> 876.74s]  Oh shit. SU. And I don't know why I thought that was not safe for work. What? I was like,
[876.74s -> 885.98s]  what are you talking about? Scott Saints, NS, like what the fuck? All right, that's the AU.
[885.98s -> 900.33s]  We're in Australia. But where in Australia? Australia is fucking huge. I know absolutely
[900.33s -> 912.10s]  nothing about Australia. Nothing. I would say, let me keep going. Wait, N. Oh shit. That's right.
[912.10s -> 923.30s]  NSW. Stop cheating. I wouldn't have gotten that. Oh, I think it's pretty close to Sydney, Mike.
[923.30s -> 929.45s]  All right. Got it. Stop cheating. Stop. All right. Now I'm not going to look at chat for
[929.45s -> 938.73s]  the rest of the, I'm not going to look at chat. All right. This is leaves are turning, which could
[938.73s -> 962.31s]  mean many things. Is that a ALFL? I can't tell. I can't read it. Anything's like a state or
[962.31s -> 969.64s]  something in there. I'm not going to look over a chat. I swear to God. I've seen leaves turn,
[969.64s -> 976.42s]  which that only happens in New England. The leaves only turn in fucking Boston. They don't
[976.42s -> 990.42s]  turn anywhere else. You guys ever been to Maine? Don't look at chat. Wait, what's this? Birch Harbor
[990.42s -> 1001.70s]  estates. Okay. Birch Harbor. This is definitely, this is definitely either all the way up or all
[1001.70s -> 1018.01s]  the way down, all the way up or all the way down. I don't, I don't think, hold on. Let's keep moving.
[1018.01s -> 1033.02s]  What does that say? Only, only, all right, nothing. Wait, we got a, we got a business up here. Alaska.
[1033.02s -> 1041.22s]  It was AL. Okay. This is Alaska. I told you either all the way up or all the way down. We're in Alaska.
[1041.22s -> 1049.78s]  Free bears Alaska. Is that the name of the, did they just put that there to make it so people that
[1049.78s -> 1062.58s]  play GeoGuess or know what town it is? Is there a three bears Alaska? Delta Junction. I, this is
[1062.58s -> 1066.42s]  definitely not on a coast. I don't think, I think it's pretty much in, but Alaska is fucking huge
[1066.42s -> 1073.85s]  too. It's so, wait, my face cam is in a bad spot. Isn't it? I put my face cam top, like middle right.
[1073.85s -> 1082.36s]  Hey, look at this. Let me, let me move the face cam. Top right, but then you can't see that.
[1082.36s -> 1096.42s]  No, I didn't want to turn the face cam off. No, wrong fucking button again. Wrong button again.
[1097.06s -> 1110.63s]  Wrong button again. What the fuck am I, what's, what's my OBS doing? Oh, okay. That's better.
[1111.03s -> 1118.22s]  That's good. All right. So we're in three bears Alaska, which who knows where the hell that is.
[1123.34s -> 1136.60s]  Stop looking at chat. All right. Well, we know we're in Alaska. Let's see if we can get a town.
[1136.60s -> 1148.87s]  Oh, nope. Anything else here that would give us a, give it away? Liquor, grocery, pharmacy,
[1148.87s -> 1155.59s]  fresh meat, fresh produce, sporting goods. It's got everything. This is like, this is an everything
[1155.59s -> 1167.43s]  store. Sporting goods too? Well, there's produce there. What does that mean? I'm giving it like
[1167.43s -> 1183.08s]  another minute. Fresh produce. I, I said the word wrong for a second. Like please. Auto care.
[1186.90s -> 1190.98s]  Nope. Nothing there. It's definitely in the middle. I see mountains in the distance though.
[1195.19s -> 1198.71s]  Almost all of Alaska is a mountain. That doesn't help me at all. Wait, or does it?
[1199.27s -> 1214.78s]  Look at this over here. This is pretty mountainous up here and it's pretty mountainous down here.
[1214.78s -> 1225.40s]  See that in the distance over there? I think this is the clue. My voice is such junk because
[1225.40s -> 1228.52s]  that's a mountain. We're either really far away here or, okay, here we go. Ready?
[1231.30s -> 1242.31s]  Oh my God. What's wrong with me? Grizzly group. Grizzly group cafe. Quilt Alaska.
[1245.59s -> 1252.92s]  I'm going with the mountain technique. He's old. I know. I know. Shut up. What's that say?
[1252.92s -> 1267.02s]  Or even ribs. That place is probably like 10 out of 10. Oh my God. Why are there, why is it
[1267.02s -> 1276.68s]  like a Canadian geese congregation of mailboxes over here? This feels like, this feels like too
[1276.68s -> 1282.52s]  many. Okay. We're in Quilt Alaska? I don't know. I'm going for it. Here we go. We got the mountain
[1282.52s -> 1288.42s]  range here, mountain range here. I'm going to go, I think it's a little bit closer to Anchorage.
[1288.42s -> 1297.43s]  I'm going to say it's like right here. Right between McGrath and uh, and Nikolai. That was
[1297.43s -> 1302.95s]  actually pretty good. That's not bad. I really should have just said Anchorage. It's probably
[1302.95s -> 1313.58s]  these mountains right here. This is like beautiful. Oh my God. This is like incredibly
[1313.58s -> 1324.74s]  lush and gorgeous. Okay. Where are we? Hump. I think we call it bump in America. I don't,
[1324.74s -> 1337.18s]  I don't think we call it hump. It's a, we call it bump. Who would say hump? This is a nice place.
[1337.18s -> 1354.42s]  I see uh, I see industry over here. Okay. All right. Okay. We are in, where are we?
[1355.38s -> 1365.06s]  We, I saw a flag and my brain is trying to figure out what flag that was and I have a pretty good
[1365.06s -> 1374.22s]  idea, but I'm not going to say it because I don't want to sound stupid. Oh, Chatsworth Road. That's
[1374.22s -> 1399.72s]  where you guys live. Okay. It's over here. But where? Where? Chatsworth Ave. This is Chatsworth
[1399.72s -> 1408.07s]  Road. Chatsworth Ave. All right. What's going on over here? We've got buildings. This is like
[1408.07s -> 1433.85s]  we're in like a city area. It's that T. Chatsworth Road. All right. I think I got an idea. Danger.
[1433.85s -> 1450.73s]  High voltage. I'm not going to look at chat. Chatsworth Road again. What's that? Hold on.
[1450.73s -> 1457.99s]  This is like a park. Taxi. What's that say? Max height limit. Three meters. Okay. Hold on.
[1457.99s -> 1468.84s]  What's that say? Passenger pickup. I want to get over to that building. I think I get a better idea.
[1469.56s -> 1496.74s]  Okay. It's somewhere over here. I think. What's with Chatsworth? Is every road Chatsworth?
[1510.34s -> 1514.66s]  Watch this be like somewhere like Louisiana or something, right? Like what if I'm just
[1514.66s -> 1524.58s]  completely wrong? But wait, it's all in English. Wait, what? Every road is Chatsworth. Where are we?
[1526.34s -> 1551.72s]  Hold on. Times are changing. Times are changing. Hyundai. We build tomorrow. Okay. So Hyundai.
[1552.60s -> 1567.03s]  Hold on. They are building tomorrow? No. That's not what it means. That means like Hyundai. We build
[1567.03s -> 1573.54s]  tomorrow. Like they're like a technology company. That's not what that means. Like that's not like
[1573.54s -> 1577.14s]  announcing that they're going to be starting building tomorrow. That's them saying that we
[1577.14s -> 1607.50s]  build tomorrow because they're a tech company. What flag is that? Road works. Whoa. That's...
[1607.50s -> 1619.16s]  I love that little thing. That's so cool. Is it animated? Does it go like... Oh, that's so cool.
[1620.04s -> 1631.90s]  Land Transport Authority. All right. I think I know where this is. I know where this is. But I'm like
[1631.90s -> 1640.65s]  too stupid to remember where it is. I just know that it exists in the world. I just need to figure
[1640.65s -> 1648.55s]  out where it exists in the world. And I'm not going to say where it is because I don't want
[1648.55s -> 1654.55s]  people to think I'm stupid because I don't know where it is. And I now know where it is.
[1654.55s -> 1670.04s]  Okay. I now know where it is. I've narrowed it down to here. Ministry of Education Headquarters.
[1670.04s -> 1695.45s]  But what country? Ahead. Humps. I don't... Hold on. I'm not leaving yet. What's that? Escape?
[1696.25s -> 1700.92s]  I got it. I told you it was right here somewhere. And everyone thought I was stupid. All right.
[1700.92s -> 1715.61s]  Where? Wait. Wait a minute. Wait. Is this an ad saying to come visit Malaysia? What if that's
[1715.61s -> 1721.93s]  an ad saying like, hey, leave Escape where you are right now and go to Malaysia for a vacation?
[1724.71s -> 1735.83s]  Right? Uh-oh. I don't know. I don't know. That could be... That could just be like an ad to like
[1735.83s -> 1751.82s]  go visit Malaysia. Oh, shit. Uh-oh. I don't know. All right. I think we're going to get a big reveal
[1751.82s -> 1773.82s]  coming up here. I'm not looking at you. I'm making... What does that say? SG. What's SG?
[1775.42s -> 1790.50s]  What's SG around here? Singapore would be SP. SG? Wait. No, it wouldn't. S... Sing... This is
[1790.50s -> 1799.85s]  Singapore. Where? Wait. Singapore is in Malaysia. Wait. No, it's not. What? Oh, shit. No, it's not.
[1799.85s -> 1804.81s]  It's not. It's not. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, it said visit Malaysia. Singapore is Singapore.
[1804.81s -> 1811.29s]  It's different. No, they confused me with a huge text on the screen. They confused me. It's here
[1811.29s -> 1826.76s]  somewhere. Where is it? I'm going to keep going. SG. That's Singapore. Somebody I caught in chat
[1826.76s -> 1832.94s]  earlier said South Africa. No. SG. That would be South Gaffrica. No, that's not what this is.
[1833.34s -> 1845.90s]  This is Singapore. Mandarin Hotel. Going to meeting... Getting meetings is faster.
[1846.46s -> 1856.42s]  Is that... It's Singapore. All right. I'm going to get... I'm going... I'm going for it. We're done.
[1860.89s -> 1864.41s]  No. Is it... Or is it like Malaysia? Because it's like, hey, visit... I don't know.
[1864.41s -> 1871.37s]  Wait. What was that? That truck had something on it. Who's that truck?
[1871.37s -> 1885.02s]  Where's that truck? Where's the truck? What happened? Oh, God. It disappeared.
[1885.74s -> 1890.09s]  I missed my, like, quest opportunity. All right. I'm going for it. I'm going to say
[1890.09s -> 1897.06s]  we're, like, probably in, like, a downtown area. Wait. One last little check here. What's this say?
[1903.61s -> 1908.25s]  Land Transport Authority. Okay. I'm going to say that means it's probably, like, a land transport.
[1908.25s -> 1919.40s]  It's probably, like, down here. I'm going to say it's, like, here. Let's go for it. Bingo. Done.
[1919.40s -> 1927.75s]  And that was very, very close. They almost got me with the Malaysia ad. I was like, oh, shit.
[1927.75s -> 1941.58s]  But does it mean go? Does it mean... I don't know. All right. Let's go. Snow. Snow. Right off the bat.
[1942.06s -> 1952.28s]  This actually could be... This could be New England. I thought they were going to fucking
[1952.28s -> 1958.04s]  get us with that one. Oh, yeah. You forgot to clean up the snow, GeoGuessr. Oh, I forgot to clean the
[1958.04s -> 1965.99s]  snow up. Yeah. Sorry. I caught it. They could hide it. They could, like, melt all of it everywhere
[1965.99s -> 1973.38s]  else. No, you didn't catch that part. I think that's, like, a... Is that, like, a state flag or
[1973.38s -> 1980.09s]  something? I don't know. Is it a bird or is it a moose? It looks like a bird. All right. Who has a
[1980.09s -> 1991.88s]  state bird? Every state has a state bird. Who has a state bird that looks like that? Who has a state
[1991.88s -> 2000.10s]  bird? This is... Yeah. Look at these homes. This is definitely... This is, like... This is, like, New
[2000.10s -> 2008.57s]  Hampshire or something. Oh, absolutely. This is, like, New Hampshire. Or, like, Vermont or something.
[2008.57s -> 2026.25s]  Let's go out this way. Gotta get to a main road here. And this is how I know it's... This is how I
[2026.25s -> 2031.86s]  know it's probably New England. Because, like, good luck finding the main road. Because, like,
[2031.86s -> 2042.01s]  there's a shitload of these neighborhoods that just lead into each other. This is New England. Yep.
[2042.01s -> 2048.73s]  Absolutely. I'm convinced. Yeah. This is definitely New England. I thought a driveway was a road.
[2048.97s -> 2066.46s]  This is New England. Oh, yeah. I'm convinced. Get me to a main road and I'll confirm it. Yeah.
[2066.46s -> 2072.87s]  Oh, yeah. Without a doubt in my mind. You know why I... You know why I know this is New England?
[2073.59s -> 2080.42s]  Easy fucking answer. This snow was probably here. Let's say that this photo was taken in, like,
[2081.06s -> 2090.86s]  March. That snow probably snowed in February. Or, like, January. And it's just still there.
[2090.86s -> 2097.90s]  I'm going for it. I don't think I need to see anything else. And I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go,
[2097.90s -> 2103.88s]  like, right on the border here. I'm gonna say, like, I'm gonna say, like, Western Mass up into,
[2103.88s -> 2106.68s]  like, kind of the, like, the New Hampshire potential, like, Vermont area. I'm gonna go
[2106.68s -> 2113.74s]  right here. Fuck out of here. You don't think I know my own place? You don't think I know my
[2113.74s -> 2122.42s]  own country? Are you shitting me? You don't think I know what I'm doing? It was closer to Boston,
[2122.42s -> 2142.01s]  but still. That's up in Newton. That was an absolute giveaway. That was a giveaway. Let's
[2142.01s -> 2148.71s]  do it again. This is fun. I could have said closer to Boston, but I figured it was a little bit
[2148.71s -> 2156.70s]  further out. Closer to New Hampshire. Uh, let's do it again. Are there sound effects? How come
[2156.70s -> 2173.19s]  I don't hear anything? All right. This is... Razor King. Where even are we? I have no idea.
[2173.19s -> 2186.14s]  Pharmacy? Butchery? Fast foods? It's like a little... This is a market. All right. I think,
[2186.14s -> 2207.35s]  I think I've got an idea. Get out to a main road here. What's that say? Otimo Saco. Wait! What's
[2207.35s -> 2223.46s]  this? Otimo... Otimo Saco. It's definitely not over here. It's definitely down here.
[2224.58s -> 2244.95s]  But where? Forward Travelers. Otimo Saco. Otimo Saco. What is this? Good times. Good times.
[2246.44s -> 2258.18s]  Jackpot! Jackpot on the top of the truck. Wait! There's a chemist! Pharmaceuticals
[2258.18s -> 2279.70s]  chemistry. I love, I love the word chemist, by the way. Where are we though? Breakthrough Summit
[2279.70s -> 2292.01s]  2018. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What's that say? In 21 days. I can't read that.
[2292.57s -> 2311.11s]  Rwanda. I don't know where that is. Are you sure it's Rwanda? Hold on. Oh, I gotta go back to the
[2311.11s -> 2321.24s]  chemist. You're reading chat. I don't know! I'm not! I have to read chat sometimes. I don't know where
[2321.24s -> 2335.86s]  Rwanda is. Where is... I don't know where that is. You're an ignorant streamer. I don't know where
[2335.86s -> 2346.82s]  Rwanda is. I don't know. Central... I don't... I know it's like... Oh, shit! There it is! Thanks, chat,
[2346.82s -> 2355.64s]  for shit. Right here. Let's go. You didn't even have it correct! You guys got it wrong!
[2355.64s -> 2370.25s]  I love chemist. Billy Hills. Oh, that's not... I thought that was like a sign of where we were.
[2372.09s -> 2393.27s]  Vote for Billy Hillis. But where? What state or county? That's Billy Hillis. Okay. That's either
[2394.36s -> 2403.16s]  somewhere in the UK or a GTA NPC character that you do missions for that like has a tractor.
[2403.64s -> 2411.24s]  And like at some point during the story, like drives the tractor through like a store to save
[2411.24s -> 2417.11s]  you. And you have to get in the tractor and like drive the tractor and like avoid the police and
[2417.11s -> 2437.56s]  stuff. So we're... It could be either one. Classic tractor NPC joke. All right. Where are we? This is
[2437.56s -> 2451.00s]  a... This is definitely... Is it one house? How do you get your trash out here? This is like a hundred
[2451.00s -> 2459.45s]  miles away from the... Your driveway. Can you imagine how... Imagine lying on the couch with
[2459.45s -> 2468.49s]  no pants on? Just being like, ah, I gotta take the trash out. You gotta go for a fucking walk.
[2471.75s -> 2483.69s]  That sucks. That's so... That's too much. That kind of house, you just have a maid. I don't know.
[2486.33s -> 2504.46s]  You have to get a golf cart, a trash golf cart. Somebody said that's not that far? This is far.
[2506.17s -> 2520.63s]  This is a far way to go. To bring a bag of trash here. That's far. Yeah. I don't know about that.
[2520.63s -> 2527.50s]  That's like you look out this window and even get in the barrel too, right? Like when you know you
[2527.50s -> 2535.38s]  gotta go get the barrel, you just look out this window staring, just going, I'll get it tomorrow.
[2537.42s -> 2545.42s]  And then tomorrow you look out there again and you go, I'll get it tomorrow. You will drive by this
[2545.42s -> 2552.25s]  barrel. You will pull into your driveway and you'll look out the window and you'll go, fuck.
[2552.25s -> 2564.38s]  And you'll just keep going. Barrel? I mean barrel. Barrel. Barrel. Trash bar... I call it a barrel.
[2564.38s -> 2567.58s]  Trash can. I call it a barrel. I'm from a different part of the world than you. Sorry.
[2568.86s -> 2572.54s]  Sorry, I'm from a different part of like the country than you. I'm not in the same country
[2572.54s -> 2576.98s]  that you're in. I call it a barrel. It's a barrel. Well, sorry, we have different ways of talking.
[2581.78s -> 2589.08s]  Donkey Kong trash can. It's a barrel. Whatever. I'm not... I'm not gonna take a sip out of this
[2589.08s -> 2596.58s]  just because you said that. A barrel. Okay, you wanna... Okay, what do you call the thing that
[2596.58s -> 2606.12s]  changes the channel on your television? We have to talk about this every six months.
[2606.12s -> 2612.17s]  Changer. I call it a changer. A remote. When I was younger, we called it a changer beeper.
[2612.17s -> 2617.40s]  It was just the... It was the changer beeper. And that was cute and fun and whatever. Sorry,
[2617.40s -> 2624.78s]  we talk differently. Clicker. No, sorry, you don't say it right. It's the remote control.
[2624.78s -> 2636.58s]  TM. You say clicker. You say changer. Sorry, you got it wrong. I don't know why you did that.
[2636.58s -> 2646.76s]  All right, this is definitely... This is def... I don't know. I'm gonna go like up here. Like here.
[2646.76s -> 2652.12s]  It's probably like the Netherlands or something. Or like UK. I don't know.
[2652.12s -> 2660.26s]  We need to live in more information. This is... Wait. Oh, I went backwards. I was like,
[2660.26s -> 2684.82s]  why is every house the same house? This cow is just here. All right. Wow. That's cool.
[2685.38s -> 2716.22s]  I think I'm narrowing down my decision here. Not yet. This is so beautiful. It's so great.
[2716.22s -> 2720.30s]  Okay, I've never been to the UK before. Never been to Ireland. Never been to Scotland.
[2720.86s -> 2726.63s]  But does anybody else feel like it just smells nice here? It's probably the air is probably so
[2726.63s -> 2753.34s]  clean. It's probably so fresh. What's that say? Einstein. Einstein rugs. I don't know. Wait a
[2753.34s -> 2779.03s]  minute. That's rugby. I'm fucking around. I'm kidding. All right. Where are we?
[2783.19s -> 2793.56s]  Oh, we're gonna get it right off the bat. It's gonna be right here. Dude, is that a fresh wild
[2793.56s -> 2803.26s]  apple? Are you serious? Where is this? That's a fresh wild orange. Or is that a wild tomato?
[2803.26s -> 2810.89s]  That's a wild tomato. A wild onion? Holy shit. That's awesome. This is wild fruits and vegetables.
[2811.45s -> 2825.34s]  Oh shit. All right. Where are we? We're in Asia somewhere. I can't get over that wild like
[2826.14s -> 2854.14s]  orange. Are they more like wild fruits? Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't know. I don't know where,
[2854.14s -> 2858.89s]  but we're here somewhere. Holy shit. I hope you didn't hear that. That was so gross. That's worse
[2858.89s -> 2873.32s]  noise there. If it picked up on the mic, it was like a bullfrog. It was like, all right. Oh my
[2873.32s -> 2880.95s]  God. Can you imagine the amount of wild berries and fruits that are out here? Oh my God. This is
[2880.95s -> 2891.64s]  so... I feel like you live longer if you're in a place like this. Like you're surrounded by
[2891.64s -> 2899.00s]  like agriculture and oxygen and not like Starbucks and tar. Don't you think you probably live longer
[2899.00s -> 2911.67s]  when you live in a place like this? Surrounded by wild onion trees. It's like a lot of us are
[2911.67s -> 2918.50s]  just like surrounded by like concrete and lights. I imagine if like you were surrounded by like
[2918.50s -> 2938.15s]  oxygen and wild berry trees. Okay. Wait, we got something here. Shit. I don't know how to read
[2938.15s -> 2950.23s]  that. What's that? That's something dot dot. Is that dot K U? Dot K U. Something dot K U.
[2955.26s -> 2960.47s]  Is that a website? No, that's not a website. I thought it was like something dot like dot
[2960.47s -> 2965.18s]  com or something. I thought that was a website. I thought that was a website. All right. That's
[2965.18s -> 2977.22s]  not a fucking website. It's a website. Fucking goddamn idiot. All right. It's... I'm gonna...
[2977.22s -> 2991.58s]  We're gonna go here. I've narrowed... It's somewhere in this square. I'm not pretending. I'm really just
[2991.58s -> 2998.66s]  like... I don't know. My brain's a little deluded. All right. I'm... Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[2998.66s -> 3018.81s]  Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Uh-huh. Oh, yep. Oh, yeah. Yep. Hold on. Let me
[3018.81s -> 3045.29s]  get it closer. Let me get it closer. Yep. It's close. Ah! Oh, it's an animal! What is that? It's
[3045.29s -> 3062.79s]  like a bat flying into the camera. What is that? What is happening? What is this animal? There's
[3062.79s -> 3079.74s]  like an animal stuck. Why is it like flattened on this windshield? It's following you. Okay. Where
[3079.74s -> 3088.07s]  are we? What the hell is happening? Is it... Wait. Is it a leaf? Or is it actually like an animal or
[3088.07s -> 3111.45s]  like a bug on the camera? It's changing. Whatever it is. It's growing. Is it a bag? I don't know.
[3112.17s -> 3123.45s]  All right. Where are we? This looks like, um... I'm seeing sand here. It looks sandy.
[3124.17s -> 3149.43s]  The sand. Okay. We got a UPS shirt on? This dude is fucking jacked! Holy shit! What a Chad!
[3150.15s -> 3171.67s]  This is like a Giga Chad! I see the American flag. So, we're in the United States. It's
[3171.67s -> 3192.86s]  deserty. That could be a few places though. This guy. All right. This is... This might actually be
[3193.94s -> 3202.90s]  somewhere down here. This is... This is potentially like the kind of Nevada, Arizona,
[3203.78s -> 3208.98s]  potentially like New Mexico. Like, I'm thinking New Mexico. New Mexico, Arizona. I'm thinking.
[3210.04s -> 3217.80s]  Like, somewhere over here. I don't think this is Vegas. I don't think this is Nevada. Although,
[3217.80s -> 3227.10s]  no. No. I don't know. It's close. It could be. It actually could be. It could be right here.
[3227.10s -> 3236.66s]  I'm gonna say, like, it could be here. But we're not done yet because it seems like we're getting
[3236.66s -> 3247.40s]  to a road here. Texas is a lot more green. Texas is a lot more green, but there is a lot of green
[3247.40s -> 3265.11s]  here. I'm thinking Arizona or New Mexico. What's that? Welcome to Highland Ranch. Wait, why did
[3265.11s -> 3281.58s]  it just turn into a different fucking season? Wait, what? What happened? What? It just turned
[3281.58s -> 3292.07s]  into a different state. It ain't down here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No chance in hell.
[3292.07s -> 3307.72s]  It's up here. Where? Maybe it is Texas. I don't... I don't know. This is not Colorado. No way.
[3309.56s -> 3318.73s]  This is, like, somewhere over here. I don't think it's this far up. No, it's not that. It's not
[3318.81s -> 3326.44s]  north Utah. It's southern Utah. In fact, it could be Utah and Nevada border here. Something like
[3326.44s -> 3343.35s]  down here. I don't know. It's close. Let me keep going. Whatever that animal is, it's still here.
[3347.83s -> 3355.80s]  School. Hold on. Wait. Something up here. Whatever that is, we're gonna get a look at it.
[3355.80s -> 3368.78s]  What is this? School? It's a school. Does it have a name? What's the name of the school?
[3370.65s -> 3382.23s]  Ah, Virginia. No, that's... no, Virginia's the name. Virginia Palmer. Go Palmer. Good luck on your
[3382.23s -> 3394.30s]  tests. This is not... this is not... this is not Virginia. No way. No, this is... it's impossible
[3394.30s -> 3404.46s]  for it to be Virginia. All right, I'm gonna make my guess here. There's snow, so I'm leaning more
[3404.46s -> 3410.70s]  towards it not... I'm leaning more towards it being, like, here. Salt Lake gets snow. This area,
[3410.70s -> 3415.30s]  I don't know. But when you go up here, you get into, like, Wyoming and Idaho, and it's not
[3415.86s -> 3422.73s]  like that. I'm gonna... I'm going right here. Right here, kind of near the Nevada border, but not
[3422.73s -> 3436.02s]  quite Nevada. I'm going here. Right here. Fuck! It was Reno! Oh, shit! That makes sense, because
[3436.02s -> 3444.92s]  right here, a border of California. I gotta stop thinking about Vegas. That right on the border,
[3444.92s -> 3463.72s]  that's right. Yeah, Reno does get snow. That's all right. Italy. Italy, France, and Italy. This is
[3463.72s -> 3482.84s]  Italy. Where in Italy? Italy. Done. That's speedrun right here. Wait, that was the... I thought that
[3482.84s -> 3491.05s]  was the Italian flag. Does this mean don't... is that a no entry, or is that a flag? Does this
[3491.05s -> 3496.50s]  mean you can't go in here? This looks like a, like, don't enter. Wait, what is that? That's not...
[3496.50s -> 3503.05s]  what flag is... that's a flag, but for what country? I thought it was, like, boats don't go this way.
[3503.05s -> 3510.79s]  Is that... that's not French. Italian. This is... okay, we're in Europe, and we're somewhere over here.
[3510.79s -> 3522.54s]  We're somewhere here, I would say. Not that far down. Somewhere, like... I'm gonna sit right here
[3522.54s -> 3535.67s]  for just a minute, because I'm not 100% sure. What? They got Dippin' Dots! They got Dippin' Dots! I
[3535.67s -> 3544.23s]  know where we are now. Whoa, these are fucking crazy. How come we don't have these? What is that?
[3544.23s -> 3560.63s]  I want that one. Nouvelle. Nouvelle. Solero. Mojito. Extreme. I don't think this is Italy.
[3567.10s -> 3583.77s]  I don't think this... I don't think this would be in Italy. What is this? Wait. Switzerland.
[3584.73s -> 3594.36s]  Rado Switzerland. This is... this is Switzerland. Or maybe it's not. It's probably... it's close to
[3594.36s -> 3607.58s]  Switzerland, though. It actually could be, like, one of these, like, here. I know we're... hold on,
[3608.22s -> 3621.37s]  I know where Switzerland is. Just give me a sec. Where the fuck... where is... where is it?
[3622.01s -> 3650.81s]  Where is... where is Switzerland? They don't have it listed on this one. All right. It's... it's... they
[3650.81s -> 3657.05s]  have a... they have a Switzerland ad and a French flag that leads me to believe, with a little bit
[3657.05s -> 3665.45s]  of deduction, that we are potentially really close to Switzerland in France. I'm gonna say
[3665.45s -> 3681.70s]  we're somewhere here. I want a little bit more info. Cars can drive down here? Wait, what?
[3681.70s -> 3688.78s]  Why are there just cars here? I thought that person crashed into the wall for a second. I was
[3688.78s -> 3698.90s]  like, what... why are they crashed? You can drive down here? I feel like this would be, like, a...
[3699.46s -> 3703.62s]  I would be terrified to drive a car here. There's, like, a lot of people.
[3704.26s -> 3713.18s]  You're gonna go up this? I don't know. That would, like, freak me out. What's that sign say?
[3716.04s -> 3727.06s]  I don't know. All right, so we're in France slash Switzerland. What's that say?
[3727.06s -> 3740.74s]  Okay, so tout du futur stationnaire. I gotta... wait, there's a... there's, like, a lake here. All right,
[3740.74s -> 3748.95s]  this... look, there was water, so I'm gonna say right here. Paris. Okay, really? Where's the Eiffel
[3748.95s -> 3770.22s]  Tower then? NA education? I feel like I'm, like, about to start, like, mission one of an RPG,
[3770.22s -> 3777.19s]  like, a Far Cry game. I'm, like, following the NPC somewhere. Where are... where... what... where did
[3777.35s -> 3786.68s]  put me? Where is this? What is... what's going on? Where are we? Where the fuck are we? It's...
[3786.68s -> 3791.64s]  it's the beginning of, like, a Hitman level. Is this, like, a... like, a bridge club for,
[3791.64s -> 3801.10s]  like, old people? What is this? No, this is a tour guide. There... this is a tour somewhere.
[3801.10s -> 3808.95s]  So this is... this must be a landmark. I don't know what it is, though. Let's keep going this
[3808.95s -> 3828.95s]  way. See if we get any more data. There's a lot of people here. I see camera. I see camera. Tour guide
[3828.95s -> 3852.30s]  camera. I see brochures on the ground. Damn. Is this a line? Okay, there's a tour guide here
[3852.30s -> 3860.49s]  giving a speech. Why did the Google car drive down here? Can you imagine just sitting there
[3860.49s -> 3869.38s]  getting, like, a tour? And, like, the... the Google car just scans all of your faces?
[3876.54s -> 3897.61s]  Virginia! Virginia. I see a Virginia t-shirt. What's on the hat? Oh, I can't read... lightning?
[3899.40s -> 3908.10s]  I can't read it. Is a tour... yeah, this is a tourist area in Virginia or somewhere in that area.
[3913.14s -> 3933.50s]  Okay, wherever this is, this is like a... why, the trees have names? Markings? Where is this? Hold on,
[3933.50s -> 3962.63s]  that's... oh, shit. Is this, like, an old, like... hold on. Where is this? This is, like, an old,
[3963.67s -> 3969.75s]  an old fucking, like, plantation or something? What the fuck? Okay, where are... where is... where
[3969.75s -> 4001.40s]  are we? Monte... Montecello. Montecello. Where's that? Where is that? Where is that? Okay, I'm
[4001.40s -> 4022.78s]  looking for it. Monte... I don't know. I don't know where it is. I'm just looking... I'm just looking
[4022.78s -> 4050.66s]  for the town. Oh, nope. All right, here's Maryland. Like, right here? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[4050.66s -> 4072.89s]  ah. Come on, I can't get this exact. I'm gonna say right here. Ooh, okay, it was... it was right
[4072.89s -> 4079.42s]  outside of Charlottesville. What the fuck? All right, well, we got... okay, we got that one.
[4080.92s -> 4088.68s]  Wait, what time is it? It was on the screen? Fuck, whatever. All right, so I... Ster and I got a...
[4088.68s -> 4095.03s]  I'm having too much fun, but Ster and I are... have a scheduled date for Dying Light 2. So,
[4095.03s -> 4098.79s]  maybe, like, one more. Maybe one or two more. Ster, if you're watching right now, then, like,
[4098.79s -> 4116.73s]  just, um, maybe, like, another 20, 30 minutes. All right, this is absolutely, absolutely
[4121.62s -> 4149.38s]  somewhere with a lot of green. A lot of green. Birds. He said birds! This is not in the United
[4149.38s -> 4162.63s]  States. This is somewhere else. Where? This is... I'm thinking, like, is this, like, Greek? No, not
[4162.63s -> 4177.02s]  Greek. It's, like, Spain? Is this South America? This could be, like, hmm. I need more intel. I
[4177.02s -> 4190.09s]  need a little bit more intel. Does that say? I can't read it. I don't know. I need a little
[4190.09s -> 4198.17s]  bit more intel. You think it's Greek? I'm not reading chat right now. I don't know. I just
[4198.17s -> 4210.09s]  think... I thought, like, Greek. I don't know. What is that? That's just, like, a picture of something.
[4210.09s -> 4234.63s]  A sign with a picture? Is that a picture of this road? Is it a mirror? Whoa! I changed my... I
[4234.63s -> 4246.84s]  changed... I think it's South America somewhere, I think. Like, here. I need way more intel. Ah!
[4250.94s -> 4251.42s]  Wait a minute.
[4260.34s -> 4265.80s]  French. No, it's not French. That's like a shitty dressing that somebody made up.
[4267.30s -> 4280.31s]  It's French dressing and ranch. Can I get some French dressing? That's... No, we're here. We're
[4280.31s -> 4289.56s]  somewhere here. We're somewhere here. I'm going for it. Right here. Oh, that was French! That was
[4289.56s -> 4300.50s]  French. Ah, I should have just known. I was speaking... I was saying, like, the French words
[4300.50s -> 4308.20s]  too. 28 fucking points. My god. Why did you think Brazil... I don't know, because Brazil is, like...
[4308.92s -> 4314.28s]  Brazil's got, like, so much, like, lush, like, beautiful green, and I don't know. I saw, like,
[4314.28s -> 4319.72s]  the... I thought it was, like, I don't know. I'm just... I'm not very well traveled, okay?
[4320.44s -> 4346.90s]  Not at all. Am I kind of stuck in this parking lot? Ooh. Estrella de Luz. Okay. Hold on. Hold on
[4346.90s -> 4359.00s]  here. Fashion store. Saldos. Vestuario, lingerie, digitaria, ten... All right. Okay, okay, okay,
[4359.00s -> 4382.76s]  okay. Okay, okay, okay. This is not France. Oh, hold on. All right. I don't know where this is.
[4383.40s -> 4397.13s]  Serras do Porto. I think it's in this area. Bem-vindo seja bem-vindo. Gondomar parades
[4397.13s -> 4409.02s]  velongo. Como alto, patrón sinio de sua excelencia. Something is excellent. I need to find out what
[4409.02s -> 4439.18s]  it is. President of the Republic. Preacher. I need more intel. This could be... this could go
[4439.18s -> 4453.46s]  either way here. I... this could go... it could be either one. This is either. I don't like Mondays.
[4458.15s -> 4472.95s]  Oh, Pedro. Yeah, yeah. Property. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Pedro. Es Pedro. Escola de...
[4473.83s -> 4479.03s]  I don't... this could go... it could be either way. This is either Europe or
[4481.62s -> 4492.28s]  like Central America or something maybe? I don't know. It's either North America, South America,
[4494.57s -> 4528.38s]  Europe, Asia. 999 euros. What is that? That's euro. So now where? It's got wi-fi.
[4531.50s -> 4549.48s]  Sondo P.T. Okay. I don't think we're on a coast though. Not a coast. Yeah, this is... this is...
[4549.48s -> 4559.53s]  I see a lot of green. A lot of green. Wait. Porto? Why does Porto ring a bell for me? I swear to
[4559.53s -> 4572.04s]  God, Porto was somewhere. Going right here. Oh, man. That was close. Okay, cool. All right.
[4572.68s -> 4594.47s]  I got it. Let's automatically get this set over here. Would be anywhere in this vicinity. Tamaya.
[4594.47s -> 4621.51s]  Okay. Tamaya. Parking a hundred something. Right? We got... no, never mind. I don't know. I really
[4621.51s -> 4625.91s]  don't know. This could... I mean the easy answer here is... what does that mean? What's that?
[4626.55s -> 4656.74s]  What is that? Is that... I don't know. And... wait. No. Is it Japan? Osaka. This is... yeah. This is
[4656.74s -> 4680.09s]  Japan. But where? In Japan. I'm just putting the names into memory so like if I see them.
[4684.95s -> 4702.95s]  Here we are. Let's go. Toyama. Anything that can get me closer though because this is pretty big
[4702.95s -> 4710.66s]  place. I'm not seeing a lot of green. I think we're somewhere down like in this area. I'm gonna
[4710.66s -> 4719.66s]  go right here. What? Wait. That was Nintendo? What do you mean? I didn't see Nintendo. Where?
[4720.90s -> 4731.21s]  Nintendo HQ? What? All the signs said Toyama. I didn't know I was next to Nintendo. I'm pissed
[4731.21s -> 4752.82s]  now. I saw all the signs. Toyama. Toyama. Toyama. I saw like three of them. Okay. This is... what are
[4752.82s -> 4761.67s]  these? These are very individually placed. Very deliberately spaced out trees. This is a farm of
[4761.67s -> 4778.55s]  some sort. What are they growing? This is very deliberate. These are berries. Wine. Wine land.
[4779.11s -> 4792.73s]  If it's wine then it's either somewhere in Italy, South America, or California. This is okay. I think
[4792.73s -> 4813.83s]  we've... or it could be Spain, Soviet, and Venta. Everything is just Italy. Every place is Italy for
[4813.83s -> 4832.95s]  I don't know why. It just is. Yeah. These are... these are wine trees. What's that? Yeah. Okay. So
[4832.95s -> 4838.47s]  this is... these are grapes. This is wine. What's a part of wine? I see a city in the distance. That's...
[4839.62s -> 4853.59s]  that's not Los Angeles. Is it LA? No. This is down here somewhere. Where's all the wine made?
[4861.53s -> 4871.05s]  Let's just go there. I... no. Where is that? Okay. I'm gonna go this way until I can figure out.
[4871.05s -> 4883.10s]  All right. We got somebody here on the road. What flag is that? Relax. It was a joke.
[4892.71s -> 4914.28s]  I've seen like motorcycles and that stop sign looks a little sus, doesn't it? I'm getting a lot
[4914.28s -> 4919.56s]  of minus twos. I'm just saying that stop sign does not look like a stop sign that... I don't think
[4919.56s -> 4926.52s]  this is America. I think we're in South America and we're about to get over to this city and we're
[4926.52s -> 4932.68s]  gonna see what it says. Wine country in South America or wine country in North America,
[4932.68s -> 4946.36s]  Central America. I don't know. This could be somewhere here. You know what? I'm... I'm going...
[4946.36s -> 4951.88s]  I'm going probably Argentina. That's what I'm thinking. I think this is potentially Argentina.
[4956.34s -> 4973.35s]  In fact, yeah. We're going right here in Argentina. All right. One more. One more. One more. One more.
[4973.35s -> 4978.30s]  Last one. One more. Maybe one more after that. Defensive stir like starts yelling at me.
[4980.46s -> 4995.72s]  All right. Where are we? The tow zone. Art, art. Art, art. Art for art. Object 19.
[4999.32s -> 5013.03s]  Burgtheater. The Burgtheater is over here. This is... is this like... it's Sweden maybe? Denmark,
[5013.03s -> 5021.06s]  Sweden. I don't want to look at chat. I don't want to give it away. Panzerhalle.
[5028.87s -> 5042.87s]  Wait. Is this Germany? Is this... no. Austria? Hungary? Slovenia? It's not Texas.
[5042.87s -> 5072.02s]  This is... I think this is Texas. This is absolutely Germany. But where? Object 12.
[5072.58s -> 5078.12s]  Let me get out to like a big street.
[5095.00s -> 5098.28s]  This is... this is definitely Germany. We got to find the city though.
[5101.10s -> 5123.96s]  Mobilix? No. Oh, it's... there was Burgtheater. The Burgtheater. Hamburg. Austria. Okay. All right.
[5123.96s -> 5134.57s]  I think I've got an idea. I'm thinking... I'm thinking Greek. I'm thinking Greece. See?
[5136.12s -> 5153.67s]  Greek lettering. Well, we're back. We're over here again. Okay. Well, we're... I know where we are.
[5154.23s -> 5179.80s]  I just don't know what... I need specific names. This is Japan. No, it's not. This is not Japan.
[5180.36s -> 5188.50s]  I don't know what are these... these things. It's like a weird... it's like... is that so you can see
[5188.50s -> 5208.47s]  like over here while you're driving this way? Where in Japan? This looks a little more country
[5208.47s -> 5212.23s]  to me because we're out here with the big mountains. The big... I don't know. This feels
[5212.23s -> 5217.83s]  a little more country. I don't think this is in a major city. This is not like Tokyo or like
[5219.27s -> 5234.63s]  Kyoto or, you know, I... this is... this feels kind of like country. What is going on here?
[5236.62s -> 5249.05s]  What is this? That... is that water? This is crazy. This is... okay. That's cool. It's making...
[5249.05s -> 5258.25s]  they're making rice? Really? You just like make your own rice? I feel... they all live... I feel
[5258.25s -> 5261.45s]  like you... I feel like... like if you live in a place like this, you'd live like a fucking
[5261.53s -> 5269.78s]  hundred plus years. Like I don't have like rice behind me. I've got like rocks and like dirt and
[5269.78s -> 5279.74s]  concrete. Like imagine if I had like a fucking whole thing behind me. They're like... I could
[5279.74s -> 5285.24s]  just get my own shit. I can't do that though. I would ruin everything. It takes a lot to do that.
[5287.27s -> 5291.27s]  You make your own rice. You make your own like fucking tomato. People... I mean people do that.
[5291.27s -> 5298.06s]  People like make their own tomatoes. I don't know. I feel like it's different. It's different than
[5298.06s -> 5302.38s]  you taking a picture of like the tomato vine you bought. Like on Instagram. Like this is one of
[5302.38s -> 5308.31s]  them. Like maybe if you live in like the farmland or something, right? I'm not talking about like
[5308.31s -> 5314.63s]  the... like the fresh tomatoes. And there's like three. Like that's not what I'm talking about.
[5314.63s -> 5324.12s]  I'm talking about like you literally live and eat off of like your land. Grow your own tomatoes.
[5327.16s -> 5339.90s]  Don't you live in the U.S.? I live in the fucking desert, man. All right. I'm saying Japan,
[5340.54s -> 5346.90s]  grow some agave. Yeah. I mean I could grow... I could grow agave. But what's that gonna do? Like
[5346.90s -> 5361.56s]  I'm gonna squeeze that in my coffee. All right. I'm going here. Right here. Done. It's close. I knew
[5361.56s -> 5380.18s]  it was like kind of in the country. Grow your own weed. Okay. This is weird. I never... Okay.
[5381.22s -> 5384.74s]  I might... This might be weird. Oh! I didn't tell you about my dream. Okay. But this is more
[5384.74s -> 5389.80s]  important. So it's gonna be kind of messy because I don't really... It's hard to piece it together
[5389.80s -> 5393.40s]  because I woke up and I like fell back asleep and woke up. I think this is why I have a headache.
[5394.55s -> 5399.67s]  So I had a dream... Remember the dream that I had a while back where I was naked on stream
[5399.67s -> 5406.07s]  and like I went up like this and like my like my you know genital area showed like a little bit
[5406.07s -> 5409.75s]  right here and I freaked out and nobody said anything in the chat and I deleted the vlog and
[5409.75s -> 5416.49s]  shit. This was... That evolved. This was... This was 2.0 that dream. So let me see if I can like
[5416.49s -> 5424.47s]  piece this together. I need to take a second. In this dream, it was a big event stream and it was
[5424.47s -> 5429.90s]  like there's a ton of people watching and it was a big event, right? Whatever it was. And I don't
[5429.90s -> 5435.10s]  know why. I have no idea why. My brain just decided to do this. At some point like in the
[5435.10s -> 5443.00s]  middle of this stream, we had to go BRB and like I had to change like costume. I gotta get in my
[5443.00s -> 5448.04s]  new... I gotta get in a costume. Okay. Costume change. And I don't know why but like when I came
[5448.04s -> 5455.86s]  back like from the BRB like at five minutes, I was naked. Like naked with a towel like in like
[5455.86s -> 5459.62s]  with me. Like walking around like I had just got out of the shower and like maybe I didn't like
[5459.62s -> 5464.07s]  expect that like the camera was... I don't know why this was happening. Like I was changing like
[5464.07s -> 5468.63s]  in like an area or something and like the camera came back and I was like on stream and I was like
[5468.63s -> 5475.05s]  what the fuck is going on? Why am I on... What's happening? And like I freaked out and like the
[5475.05s -> 5482.63s]  stream ended, right? Here's the... Here's the fucking crazy part. Apparently... This is like
[5482.63s -> 5489.51s]  three hours of the stream had been going at this point. Apparently, the stream was not pushed to
[5489.51s -> 5499.10s]  the Twitch servers. So we were... This was just broadcasted to nothing. So I was like no way.
[5499.10s -> 5504.86s]  Wait, what? So we haven't even been streaming? Oh my fucking god. This... That's so... Oh my god.
[5504.86s -> 5509.48s]  Thank god. Like there was a camera problem. I don't know what fucking happened. Whatever, right?
[5509.48s -> 5513.72s]  So I was like wait a minute. So we have like the studio recording version of that whole stream
[5513.72s -> 5517.72s]  and it was like Community Jake was like yeah yeah we got the whole thing recorded man it's all good
[5517.72s -> 5522.14s]  and I'm like fucking Jesus. I don't know how I like walked into frame. I don't know what happened
[5522.14s -> 5526.46s]  but like wait a minute. That whole stream was like a bunch of money, a bunch of time.
[5527.46s -> 5532.33s]  Why don't we just like censor that part and I'll just like... We'll just do a rebroadcast,
[5532.33s -> 5540.07s]  right? Instead of removing the scene entirely. I was like why don't we just like rebroadcast,
[5540.07s -> 5543.91s]  like play the video and like just because I didn't like push the Twitch servers or something.
[5543.91s -> 5551.98s]  What the fuck? So instead of removing the whole thing, just cut that part. We had like a black
[5551.98s -> 5560.31s]  censor bar over me during that part and the worst part about it is when it got to that point like
[5560.31s -> 5567.99s]  I don't know if it was I edited it I guess but like when it got to that part and like one frame
[5568.07s -> 5574.41s]  was not moved correctly and you still saw me naked and I'm being like what the fuck man what
[5574.97s -> 5579.13s]  I'm still naked you what happened we're supposed to censor that part did I miss it
[5579.99s -> 5587.67s]  and like everybody freaked out in chat. Like I don't know why our brains do this shit. Why
[5587.67s -> 5592.98s]  wouldn't I have just taken that part out of the stream? Why wouldn't I have just taken that part
[5592.98s -> 5600.39s]  out? Why did it have to be there with a censor bar? The fact that like it was streamed and like it
[5600.39s -> 5606.55s]  got caught like holy shit oh my god thank god I caught that oh we can just re-upload we can
[5606.55s -> 5615.64s]  just do like another broadcast but make sure make sure we censor that part so stupid that was the
[5615.64s -> 5623.69s]  dream because please keep your dream journal if you don't I know I always say I'm going to but I
[5624.49s -> 5630.49s]  every time I have a dream I wake up I kind of feel like shit and I go I gotta go back to bed I feel
[5630.57s -> 5638.41s]  terrible and I put my head down and I fall back asleep you go over the dream like 30 plus times
[5638.41s -> 5643.61s]  in your brain and then you fall back asleep you wake up an hour or two later and it's gone
[5643.61s -> 5649.56s]  and maybe a little bit is still there all right where are we and now I have like a really bad
[5649.56s -> 5657.67s]  migraine today so it's kind of annoying if you have a lucid dream yes and the thing about a
[5657.67s -> 5662.47s]  lucid dream is when you start to become aware that you're lucid dreaming you have to like use
[5662.47s -> 5668.81s]  magical superpowers to concentrate to keep yourself from trying to get out so you sit there and you go
[5671.13s -> 5676.42s]  wait don't move you kind of have to not move you have to sit there and just go don't move don't
[5676.42s -> 5682.98s]  just don't think and just let yourself become lucid without becoming completely lucid because
[5682.98s -> 5690.76s]  if you're like here we go I'm in the lucid dream you're out once you are aware of lucid dreaming
[5690.76s -> 5698.44s]  stop and just don't do anything don't think don't move let yourself just solidify into the lucid
[5698.44s -> 5703.26s]  dream if you want to because once you're aware of it it starts to pull you out it's really hard to do
[5703.26s -> 5713.64s]  your lucid dream just look at your hands no I mean no no here's the thing if you flick lights
[5713.64s -> 5718.41s]  they don't work if you look at a clock it won't work you can't here's things about dreams that
[5718.41s -> 5724.18s]  are interesting if you use a light switch in a dream it will not turn on it won't work that's
[5724.18s -> 5730.20s]  how you'll be like wait what the fuck's happening if you try to read in a dream you cannot read
[5730.20s -> 5736.66s]  that part of your brain is not turned on so if you look at a clock or a or a like a piece of
[5736.66s -> 5741.22s]  text or a book you're going to be it's going to be just mess you did I don't know what that says I
[5741.22s -> 5747.24s]  can't read that it's nothing it's like this alien language if you look in a mirror be careful
[5747.24s -> 5750.76s]  because when you look in a mirror your brain decides to fill in those blanks because a
[5750.76s -> 5757.16s]  mirror does not work in a dream so you will see horrifying twisted shit if you look in a mirror
[5757.16s -> 5763.85s]  I'm serious like don't be careful when you look in a mirror uh because your brain has to pretend
[5763.85s -> 5769.38s]  that you're actually looking into a mirror and your your mouth your eyes might get like big and

[6483.40s -> 6487.08s]  I'm like don't want to I have like too much fun when I'm with you and I owe my game crashed
[6488.04s -> 6497.11s]  do you want to play GeoGuessr or like a round or two uh you want to co-op some GeoGuessr I mean I
[6497.11s -> 6503.38s]  think there's a co-op mode but I think um you have to like pay for it though I could just look at
[6503.38s -> 6507.86s]  your screen you could just look at the screen and like yeah like let's do that how I mean I'm not
[6507.86s -> 6521.86s]  going to help because I've only left the U.S. like once no it's don't worry let me open this up
[6524.55s -> 6528.52s]  let's play some GeoGuessr so this is let me explain how this works
[6528.52s -> 6534.28s]  so GeoGuessr is a game yeah I know how it works okay so you tell the people someone here doesn't
[6534.28s -> 6539.48s]  know no no no they know that no no this is a policy that I have it's called no chatter left
[6539.48s -> 6543.48s]  behind I feel like a lot of streamers will you know they won't will leave someone behind and
[6543.48s -> 6547.16s]  they'll just be there like I don't understand what is he looking at okay and so you have to
[6547.16s -> 6551.64s]  explicitly every 10 minutes whenever someone asks what's going on is make sure you in detail
[6551.64s -> 6556.36s]  re-explain what's going on so can we get one good explanation from you no no no everyone
[6556.36s -> 6565.10s]  everybody knows how to play this I just unlocked a razor cannon a two-handed bike razor cannon
[6565.10s -> 6576.34s]  wait you got a cannon yeah and now it's gone wait what oh I was looking at something else
[6576.34s -> 6582.60s]  I'm gonna not capture my screen I didn't play GeoGuessr it's a game where hold on
[6582.60s -> 6599.66s]  can you please explain it why can't I capture it it's annoying so I have to I might have to
[6599.66s -> 6614.60s]  like restart my obs this is annoying don't do that it obs crash uh it actually may have hold on
[6614.60s -> 6618.82s]  black screen andy I know I know I know I know I don't know what happened hold on let me try this
[6618.82s -> 6647.13s]  what the fuck what the fuck did I get it ah I got it that was weird I had to restart this like
[6647.13s -> 6654.66s]  three times all right I'm gonna change my stream title because this is wrong so as you see let's
[6654.66s -> 6661.59s]  go and get that face cam turned on so as you see wait I'm gonna have to see your face you don't
[6661.59s -> 6666.74s]  have to but okay so can one and can one of the mods please change it to GeoGuessr you don't
[6666.74s -> 6671.70s]  change your own stream titles I have to like get I don't I do but if somebody can do it it's easy
[6672.50s -> 6677.94s]  all right so as you see on the screen here you have to decide where we currently are where are
[6677.94s -> 6682.66s]  we where it could be anywhere in the entire world it's just any place that has been captured by a
[6682.66s -> 6691.16s]  google device right so google um like street view google uh cars google taxis google bicycles
[6691.16s -> 6698.68s]  whatever it is I'm gonna do one and then you can do one okay well we're not gonna do it together
[6698.68s -> 6702.98s]  oh wait that would be like I so I want to know how well how much you know I don't know anything
[6702.98s -> 6708.58s]  okay well then I'm not then just watch the street just turn the stream on and watch
[6708.58s -> 6717.42s]  okay just watch your stream that's what I'm doing now I'm watching Jerma stream all right I think
[6717.42s -> 6725.40s]  this is I'm seeing some text up here koditar koditar.fi I think that might be Finland I think
[6725.40s -> 6732.09s]  we're in a Finland area here yeah I'm just watching would you say sir that this is fi
[6732.09s -> 6741.35s]  Finland makes a lot of sense doesn't it um I mean that makes sense okay if we keep going down
[6741.35s -> 6748.66s]  we're looking for something that would be give us an idea of exactly where we could be
[6748.66s -> 6758.76s]  we're in Finland somewhere but can we narrow down the city well how how far do you get to
[6758.76s -> 6763.78s]  travel down the road before the thing is like hey come on man you can as long as you want
[6763.78s -> 6769.86s]  there's no time limit unless you set a time limit so there is none okay I feel like you should be
[6769.86s -> 6774.58s]  setting a time limit then because couldn't you just drive around and just ask for directions
[6774.58s -> 6778.58s]  I mean yeah but the whole point is that you don't spend too much time you just wait zoom
[6778.58s -> 6783.30s]  in on that license plate license there are here yeah they're all blurred out you got to find a
[6783.30s -> 6788.36s]  non-blurred one and I'll track it they all license plates are blurred out like can we get some can
[6788.36s -> 6792.60s]  we get some facial recognition no those are blurred out too have you ever used google street view
[6792.60s -> 6798.52s]  before I have but sometimes they might miss one all right I'm gonna say this is pretty this is
[6798.52s -> 6806.95s]  pretty the green uh lush environment how close of a guess like how close to the city do you
[6806.95s -> 6814.12s]  consider yourself a winner I would say within five miles you've won within five to ten miles I say
[6814.12s -> 6823.03s]  that that's a win that's pretty tight but within like 50 miles I think that you did a good job
[6823.03s -> 6833.03s]  okay all right we got a bus station here what is it to blur it out can't read it 4 000 is a good
[6833.03s -> 6838.66s]  score yeah that'll get you within probably like what 50 plus miles uh there's a lot of bikes
[6838.66s -> 6847.16s]  100 miles maybe a lot of motorbikes over to your left there is that's kind of cool okay I'm going
[6847.16s -> 6852.70s]  you know where I'm going I'm going Finland seeing a lot of rain I'm thinking of going I think we're
[6852.70s -> 6862.15s]  in uh Kivola just based on nothing that was that was all right that was all right that's not 130
[6862.15s -> 6867.35s]  miles that's not even good you said within 50 miles was good job yeah 131 miles that's okay
[6867.35s -> 6872.66s]  that's not bad that's more than double what would what a good job would be and you're patting
[6872.66s -> 6879.70s]  yourself on the back by your own definition lane control all right we get this is english
[6879.70s -> 6890.09s]  lane control on main road ahead lane open lane closed gizzards gazzards for decorating wait we're
[6890.09s -> 6895.77s]  I don't know we're driving on the left side of the road though so I think this is somewhere in
[6895.77s -> 6908.28s]  Europe it's always Europe goals fabrics okay this to me this looks like England look at this like
[6908.28s -> 6918.06s]  uh Big Ben clock thing that's England do you know what I mean hell any bank on the windows
[6919.27s -> 6926.86s]  under the clock tower and the windows oh okay so this is helenny antique center all right so
[6926.86s -> 6935.88s]  where's helenny that's what we're gonna figure out I'm gonna go to England helenny I'm saying
[6935.88s -> 6944.55s]  maybe the London area what do you think maybe somewhere in London um let's keep going somewhere
[6944.55s -> 6954.50s]  like in America like I've heard of America hearing care this is the driving on the right side of the
[6955.30s -> 6965.61s]  we're on the other side of the road it's not America dolphin hand car wash we need to find
[6965.61s -> 6976.86s]  helenny there's so many little towns here though it could be any of these orly new romney is it
[6976.86s -> 6986.82s]  cheating if you just google helenny yes that is 100 cheating city center all right barnsley is
[6986.82s -> 6998.26s]  that way at some point we have helenny we have barnsley and we would barnsley be I need a big
[6998.26s -> 7009.37s]  town like I need a sign that says like london freeway that way or something I feel like you
[7009.37s -> 7014.89s]  have the city name and the note the next most adjacent city like what what more do you need
[7014.89s -> 7018.66s]  you need to get it right you have to get it on the map yes so like shouldn't you be looking on
[7018.66s -> 7022.58s]  the map rather than around the city because we already have everything we need but we but we
[7022.58s -> 7025.94s]  don't though because we're looking for something that can tell us where a major city might be
[7025.94s -> 7036.36s]  located like a road sign or like oh over here okay low fields park sheffield city council
[7036.92s -> 7043.24s]  stir excuse me look at where we are sheffield and that's why you spend a little extra time
[7043.72s -> 7051.46s]  now we've got sheffield the next step is to look for it's there it's right south of it right here
[7051.46s -> 7058.92s]  helenny if you zoom in heli that's heli not helenny we probably read it wrong do it do it
[7058.92s -> 7062.68s]  just no no that's not right this is god please please please it's not gonna be right this is
[7062.68s -> 7066.76s]  heli you click please please I'm not gonna click it because we could get we're co-opping we could
[7066.76s -> 7070.76s]  get like 10 000 points if you get it right you did the first one this one's mine I noticed the
[7070.84s -> 7081.51s]  first sign I'm in charge click it literally if we spent literally if we spent like five more
[7081.51s -> 7093.29s]  minutes we would have found it 900 yards and you're complaining but you opened up a google map
[7093.29s -> 7098.41s]  what what are you talking about didn't you just say why don't you just type in the location and
[7098.41s -> 7108.60s]  I heard I saw the the name we thought it was wasn't even the name so even if I googled it I'd be
[7108.60s -> 7114.86s]  looking for helenny not heli all right do you see what's on the screen now I see what's on the
[7114.86s -> 7123.37s]  screen you're just mad because I got like within a like a mile okay so this is either this is
[7123.37s -> 7130.62s]  potentially United States somewhere like in middle America this could be somewhere in like Japan or
[7130.62s -> 7144.01s]  I need to find a main road I feel like that's cheating cheating is typing in helenny into google
[7144.81s -> 7151.30s]  it wasn't helenny and pretending you know where it is click it click it yeah I just tried to
[7151.30s -> 7161.13s]  wink and both of my eyes bugged out there's a freeze frame in there somewhere that is terrifying
[7161.13s -> 7174.06s]  all right here we go we got a road where we going okay okay this is potentially somewhere
[7174.06s -> 7190.62s]  somewhere in Asia and get some signs here okay I think this is let's get over here closer I don't
[7190.62s -> 7201.90s]  think this is not Japan is it Japan no it's not this can't be Japan is it Japan I've gotten Japan
[7201.90s -> 7210.28s]  so many times in like the five times that I did this in a row well everyone everyone loves Japan
[7210.28s -> 7219.70s]  but it's a random place in the world mm-hmm okay it is Japan yeah ask that guy you pass the guy on
[7219.70s -> 7234.10s]  a bike ask him okay no I don't think so so what sign are you looking for when you can't read the
[7234.10s -> 7241.19s]  language I'm looking for you in there's a lot of times this the town name will be in English
[7241.19s -> 7251.85s]  or at least written out so you just do this forever I mean it's kind of the point of the game
[7251.85s -> 7268.18s]  in Japan yeah hmm big solar field out here this is the countryside they're not going to do that
[7268.66s -> 7276.95s]  they might they might yeah they might I mean we're just you're on a nice drive right now you guys
[7276.95s -> 7281.13s]  got to enjoy the journey I guess is what I'm learning yeah it's cool you should play this on
[7281.13s -> 7290.89s]  stream tomorrow so I can watch I I would be playing with like 30 second timers I hear German likes to

[7323.14s -> 7326.58s]  now we're all the way down here and we're just going to keep doing the joke the whole time
[7326.58s -> 7338.31s]  I don't want to turn that on right now but I'm going to so what I think we're going to do here
[7338.31s -> 7349.94s]  I think we need to go a little bit further down I think what you need to do to prove that you are

[7746.04s -> 7756.50s]  I think I think we're in South America somewhere like in here that's my gut reaction wait google
[7756.50s -> 7763.02s]  maps is I guess they you said they have google bikes they're driving around like yeah this is
[7763.02s -> 7770.49s]  this is not a car yeah that would be weird this is either South America or somewhere in Asia
[7777.02s -> 7787.86s]  a lot of terrain looks a lot like what's the name of that place I don't know it could be like
[7787.86s -> 7804.42s]  Central America could be wait I got a sign what does the sign say uh yeah you're right there
[7804.42s -> 7820.92s]  what is that I don't know what language that is um okay that removes South America for me
[7821.64s -> 7835.67s]  but then it has to be over here Antarctica no it's not uh I can't go any further oh he's got a
[7835.67s -> 7852.54s]  guess he's got a geo guesser uh wait okay I'll go down this road is it something here uh
[7855.51s -> 7864.02s]  on that little note what's this I can't wait until the future when you can play this game and
[7864.02s -> 7869.86s]  on like a drone and a drone just goes around and annoys people and you can like put money into the
[7869.86s -> 7873.94s]  the game client to like annoy people and be like hey where where is this and you can like ask
[7873.94s -> 7880.38s]  questions and everyone in the world knows the game you're kind of describing like tourism in
[7880.38s -> 7886.79s]  general like people go and to travel to different places and they like walk around like the books
[7886.79s -> 7891.26s]  and the maps and shit and like ask people stuff yeah this is gonna be a thing they're gonna sell
[7891.26s -> 7897.02s]  like a drone you activate the geo guesser drone and you have to pay money to ask questions to
[7897.02s -> 7904.09s]  people all right I'm going for a guess starting the business I'm gonna say it's somewhere in here
[7904.09s -> 7911.18s]  uh let's go with put it uh I'm I would put my guess right in the middle
[7911.18s -> 7916.36s]  it's right here of the ocean there just so that I can get all of those islands
[7916.36s -> 7927.32s]  and equal distance I'm gonna say hey hey hey hey hey is that the same that's that's the same
[7927.32s -> 7939.56s]  writing isn't it oh bingo right here let's go right here island that was cheating how was it
[7939.56s -> 7946.38s]  cheating all right so that was cool uh 65 miles you're 15 miles off of being good all right I'm
[7946.38s -> 7953.51s]  gonna do the challenge to play today's daily do you have what it takes to become a geo guesser
[7953.51s -> 7965.70s]  master navigator start let's start the game maybe you can get your I'm gonna make a multiplayer room
[7965.70s -> 7971.64s]  with you since he has geo guesser pro oh give me what I got your pro I'm peeing just entertain the
[7971.64s -> 7976.68s]  audience for a minute I'm just supposed to sit here and entertain the audience when I have no
[7976.68s -> 7981.88s]  control over the mouse the keyboard uh he's the one with the geo guesser pro and apparently I can
[7981.88s -> 7990.07s]  play with him and generally speaking oh I'm actually shocked he didn't mute and deafen
[7990.07s -> 7998.70s]  because he's usually so scared of what I'm going to say while he's gone but the truth is that I'm
[7998.70s -> 8006.76s]  a nice guy I don't say anything weird I mean like sometimes I talk about like like weirder stuff
[8006.76s -> 8013.62s]  like Hillary's emails and like all the comment in it and those are just like it's just life
[8013.62s -> 8025.50s]  it's all exists yeah I don't know everyone's obsessed with cum these days talk about furries
[8025.50s -> 8031.48s]  well I don't know does your most chat know about I feel like I talk about my furry policy so often
[8031.48s -> 8036.97s]  I'm spreading the word at this point you gotta gotta be a furry now to get the tax credits
[8036.97s -> 8043.06s]  for when it's uh it's a thing in the future and you can check the box for furry but if you don't
[8043.06s -> 8046.02s]  have evidence now that you were always a furry and you're just gonna look like you were playing
[8046.02s -> 8060.87s]  along everyone has to know that by now I've told pretty much everyone what's he saying is he saying
[8060.87s -> 8070.52s]  something bad did he say something bad what do you say I'm giving them like uh legal tax advice
[8070.52s -> 8079.61s]  don't do that please all right we have three minutes here we go Northwestern University
[8079.61s -> 8088.79s]  that's that's California right there California uh okay where probably in the northwest wait what
[8088.79s -> 8094.23s]  the fuck dude but that's California no it's not I just looked like California it was shaped like
[8094.23s -> 8107.59s]  California okay all right I got two and a half minutes all right uh I'm gonna go over here I
[8107.59s -> 8113.80s]  think it's in that same kind of area that we were before like down here maybe I'm gonna say I'm just
[8113.80s -> 8121.94s]  gonna go for it we only have two minutes I'm gonna say like the Philippines or our timing this is
[8121.94s -> 8128.78s]  the challenge the challenge no no no no no no it's not no it's not this is over here this is like
[8128.78s -> 8142.84s]  somewhere over here don't look I'm not looking all right I'm gonna say like uh Bangladesh right
[8142.84s -> 8153.34s]  here oh my fucking god I've nailed it next round okay good one yeah you know pretty good the time
[8153.34s -> 8170.57s]  do you get you get more points this one's gonna be hard Oklahoma it could be we gotta go kind of
[8170.57s -> 8176.17s]  fast down this road though there's no way you don't have time you need to guess these long roads
[8176.17s -> 8193.16s]  you're never gonna see anything oh my god you're just losing time shit uh this is not Oklahoma man
[8193.16s -> 8205.58s]  this is way Oklahoma's not like this what is this like side of the road are we on we are on the
[8206.65s -> 8212.70s]  right side of the road is driving you can see the car behind you okay so we okay so where is this
[8212.70s -> 8226.30s]  though this is anywhere it could be uh I'm gonna say damn it's like a cloudy day too so it's like
[8226.30s -> 8234.65s]  it's hard to tell um hmm I think this would be further north more like a Montana maybe I could
[8234.65s -> 8247.53s]  see a Montana Wyoming Dakota kind of area let's uh let's go with Wyoming I'm gonna say right in
[8247.53s -> 8261.18s]  this kind of area here like here Wyoming let's go yo I was not even close I was gonna say some
[8261.18s -> 8273.19s]  of the trees looked a little yeah for us but the right side of the road and this is uh I think this
[8273.19s -> 8281.48s]  is European I don't see these signs in America looks like California yeah I think it's California
[8281.56s -> 8290.50s]  look at these little green things what are these little green containers these are like tiny little
[8290.50s -> 8299.43s]  recyclings and to Nova are these really small or am I crazy these are tiny well Americans have a
[8299.43s -> 8306.20s]  lot of garbage that's all we have look at how little these are okay yeah this is like normal
[8306.20s -> 8325.98s]  size like rubbish for a family it's a Nova Antenna Nova I there's something going on up here this is
[8325.98s -> 8335.11s]  somewhere in South America probably shit we're right in the middle of nowhere again
[8335.11s -> 8351.90s]  this could be this that was like a dead animal or something this could be the same exact spot
[8351.90s -> 8361.11s]  this looks pretty much uh it's either okay I'm saying down in that same exact area or
[8361.11s -> 8376.26s]  somewhere in like Europe like here any input I have never left my home all right well I'm going
[8376.26s -> 8382.79s]  with like Russia I'm going with like I did hear earlier that you always go with Russia a good
[8382.79s -> 8403.99s]  reason you think everywhere in Europe is Russia it's like ratio okay we're this is Asia but where
[8403.99s -> 8416.46s]  in Asia let's go which way look what looks more populated down here I don't know it's not Japan
[8416.46s -> 8425.94s]  again is it Japan again again I mean it's been this is like so how rare would this be to have
[8425.94s -> 8437.91s]  it in like anywhere in the world and I've gotten Japan like seven times okay here we are that's a
[8437.91s -> 8442.87s]  nice hill that's what I really I'm liking this this tree hill Japan's fucking beautifully okay
[8442.87s -> 8450.57s]  oh yeah you got names Naroshi and and Suzu and Naroshi Suzu's closer 15 kilometers yeah
[8450.57s -> 8468.54s]  Suzu is closer oh no was it Naroshi I got one minute and 52 seconds to find it this could be
[8468.54s -> 8473.03s]  big points here Naroshi or Suzu Naroshi or Suzu come on
[8479.14s -> 8508.36s]  hmm no come on one minute you need this man Naroshi or Suzu
[8526.01s -> 8547.19s]  um I need this 40 seconds hmm shit yeah also you could look for 249 highway 249 25 seconds
[8547.19s -> 8565.08s]  there's so many numbers on the screen good luck 15 seconds yeah this is a fake image
[8565.08s -> 8581.61s]  from uh this place isn't real Africa wait this is where I clicked
[8583.50s -> 8589.34s]  you must not have clicked in time or something because that's I'm pretty sure that's like zero
[8589.34s -> 8598.20s]  zero longitude latitude yeah fuck god damn it you just scared my cat I'm sorry I didn't know
[8598.20s -> 8604.22s]  man you you all right this is we got what side of the road are we on
[8605.18s -> 8608.62s]  precaution radar in operate okay so this is probably this is South America
[8610.20s -> 8642.70s]  or it could be like Central America too where let's go okay something up here what is on top
[8642.70s -> 8661.58s]  of this car it's like a dog chasing his tail what is that hey I all right I'm gonna say
[8661.58s -> 8675.98s]  I'm gonna try to get this quick what's that sign uh come to Brazil further come on yeah we got it

[8960.36s -> 8966.74s]  yeah you guessed and then it sets the time on me so I'm the one that needs to panic where you
[8966.74s -> 8976.30s]  gonna go where you gonna go where you gonna go where you gonna go uh I'm thinking I'm thinking

[9057.82s -> 9062.34s]  South Africa yeah I've seen a lot of offenses like that in South Africa
[9064.71s -> 9074.71s]  it was a rambunctious guess okay very very green oh this is repeat I've actually did

[9135.94s -> 9145.43s]  because I clicked Greece because you said Greece thought it was Sweden I don't know why
[9168.60s -> 9182.66s]  this is like really dramatic wait that's
[9186.54s -> 9195.08s]  hit him with the timer I'm thinking of hitting you with a timer I thought that I'm so stupid

[9334.58s -> 9344.46s]  I should have taken an extra 30 seconds tripled yeah you could win I could win with this triple
[9344.46s -> 9402.58s]  damage of these bushes and seconds dude come on how did you how did you even know that how did
[9402.58s -> 9406.82s]  you even know that because I see I had previous knowledge from hump ahead how did you know that
[9406.82s -> 9423.77s]  just looking around there's a lot of clues in the environment also how many of these have you done
[9423.77s -> 9429.21s]  before that feels kind of fucked up I've done this like five times total yeah but if you keep
[9429.21s -> 9433.61s]  getting the same ones you like twice you said you've already gotten these I mean it's it's
[9433.61s -> 9439.05s]  likely you're gonna get similar the same country more there is a whole world what do you mean there

[9728.30s -> 9734.92s]  like somewhere up in kind of the European area yeah 15 seconds is too much I'm giving them too
[9734.92s -> 9773.64s]  much time okay thought I knew but now I don't clicking you could any moment yeah I don't think
[9773.64s -> 9778.34s]  you're prepared I don't think you are either I don't think you're ready for this
[9781.14s -> 9800.81s]  I don't think you can handle this I know exactly where we are I don't think you know I've been
[9800.81s -> 9804.81s]  down this dirt path many times so how come you haven't clicked if you know where we are
[9807.50s -> 9822.26s]  you're so confident I'm definitely more certain now
[9825.75s -> 9852.42s]  can I change my answer I would have beat you honestly if I could have changed my answer I
[9852.42s -> 9860.09s]  would have beat you in one turn but what would have made you what what made you change your mind
[9860.09s -> 9876.79s]  after you clicked just get the language oh this is Greece okay might as well just want to stop
[9876.79s -> 9891.43s]  now this is Greece yeah that's Greece right there so I would so click Greece if you're so confident
[9891.67s -> 9910.09s]  if you're so confident it's so residential it's so hard to tell
[9932.73s -> 9950.22s]  oh so you heal from this one you don't like damage the other person this is just a healing
[9950.22s -> 9967.86s]  room I am understanding I get it give me something to fucking work with it not like
[9967.86s -> 10025.94s]  city skyline signs what is that supposed to mean I don't know I don't know man I don't know I
[10026.42s -> 10038.63s]  I saw that sign I don't I can't do flags you know kind of nice houses here a little
[10038.63s -> 10054.84s]  little techie little a little modern I like that design there I got a little bit of information
[10054.84s -> 10062.42s]  right there like when there's pressure I can't do anything like when I'm up against like somebody
[10062.42s -> 10069.86s]  else I'm just going to sit here with my fingers up my nose yeah just guess what do you just like
[10070.58s -> 10074.98s]  just 10 seconds like all it matters is whether you do that I don't know I'm gonna say like here
[10074.98s -> 10095.27s]  somewhere oh it's CA not California Canada but if I had a few seconds to think that through I
[10095.27s -> 10101.98s]  wouldn't have clicked that but it's not always you know in life you don't always have as much
[10101.98s -> 10108.14s]  time as you want I know but like if I had if my brain was not in like dreamland and like the music
[10108.22s -> 10129.94s]  it's like who wants to be a millionaire like hurry up music yeah this one's definitely
[10129.94s -> 10205.35s]  Greece I know that for sure whoa oh please come on Spain now what do you mean Spain
[10205.35s -> 10217.14s]  oh dude I've been here before yeah this is Greece stop saying Greece you started it yeah I started
[10217.14s -> 10251.21s]  and you just won't let it end I gotta get up to a road this one is I'm brain dead where the fuck is
[10251.69s -> 10310.49s]  that oh I unplugged my thing it looks like that at all you're gonna guess this I feel like I have a
[10311.69s -> 10333.16s]  slowing down I'm trying to figure it out slowing it down a little I don't know where it is this is
[10333.16s -> 10351.78s]  totally just for four times damage dude oh I'm gonna kill you it's all gonna be over if you
[10352.74s -> 10390.50s]  you might where the fuck is that dude yeah I don't actually know where it is
[10391.46s -> 10411.27s]  I could just I could get you right now oh fuck come on dude really I don't know I don't know
[10417.08s -> 10419.83s]  you're looking a little dead here
[10424.31s -> 10435.00s]  California I was looking at every I saw the Mariana Islands and I was looking at every I
[10435.00s -> 10439.08s]  checked the islands over there and I fast and I just like there's so many islands off of California
[10439.88s -> 10444.44s]  it starts it's not like this passport center and these trees are so not I know but it's like
[10444.44s -> 10448.68s]  office of the secretary like commonwealth of the northern but that sounds like that sounds
[10448.68s -> 10455.00s]  American to me yeah it is I think it's like it's a US territory somewhere in the fucking ocean out
[10455.00s -> 10466.94s]  there so I just clicked in the ocean all right actual last one one more okay actual last one
[10466.94s -> 10472.79s]  it is American I know but like I thought it was gonna be like right there yeah we don't we don't
[10472.79s -> 10479.30s]  let anyone be independent just play all of our independence all right let's do it fuck that
[10479.30s -> 10490.60s]  I'm one let's go you're gonna get three zeroed so bad I've been here before yeah but like okay so
[10490.60s -> 10494.84s]  stir has never played this before but you never know when you unlock a new game that you're
[10494.84s -> 10498.84s]  actually really good at and you never knew it I'm not very good at GeoGuessr so he could be
[10498.84s -> 10502.28s]  actually pretty good at it and he's like finding a new thing that he's actually really good at and
[10502.28s -> 10511.72s]  he could like just play and stream it and stuff I always have problems with languages I think as
[10511.72s -> 10522.39s]  as an artiste I pick up on a lot of like tiny little artistic like architecture details
[10522.39s -> 10530.81s]  that I've seen before but I have no fucking clue where this one will be
[10532.89s -> 10565.91s]  real it didn't count my click did it where were you clicking it didn't count my click I was so
[10565.99s -> 10574.01s]  close to that why was there Russian and English oh man I saw a sign it was English Russian and then
[10574.01s -> 10580.65s]  um like um Malaysian whoever was I saw a lot of weird shit I was thinking Madagascar for a
[10580.65s -> 10584.89s]  second I was way too zoomed out to take tourists I thought was the safer guess
[10591.14s -> 10594.66s]  there's a lot of places like uh only one place I've been where did me and Ashley go
[10595.54s -> 10602.94s]  Cayman Island there remind me a lot of that where everything is made for Americans to tourism there
[10636.07s -> 10646.20s]  uh wow we were both waiting why was there a French flag it was like a French flag right there
[10646.76s -> 10657.48s]  uh street names are French I just like I was like I'm okay French but it's even the name of this
[10657.48s -> 10683.10s]  language there's so many different languages it's so hard to oh I have no idea
[10697.80s -> 10699.40s]  it looks like the one
[10707.11s -> 10737.13s]  yeah the ring was engraved with the elvish it's elvish oh my god give me a break
[10738.55s -> 10744.98s]  give me a break you're the one that guessed but they were they were two how did you know I
[10744.98s -> 10750.49s]  guessed because it gave me 15 seconds but how do you know that how do you know that yeah I didn't
[10750.49s -> 10756.81s]  know that that was a literal guess I mean we're it's geoguessr is what I'm saying here so you
[10756.81s -> 10760.65s]  didn't look at my camera and see my hands go up and do that I don't know I'm looking at your camera
[10761.45s -> 10795.11s]  dude they have the fucking longitude here oh it's just I think I saw somebody's dick what was that
[10795.19s -> 10807.74s]  what was that that was weird what's going on what was that I couldn't even click I was dumbfounded
[10809.10s -> 10817.66s]  what do you mean it said like peep show and there was a guy sitting on a chair it freaked me out
[10817.66s -> 10821.98s]  okay well you can heal up this round you don't have to see any dicks that I was literally like
[10821.98s -> 10855.86s]  oh here comes the peep show and there was a guy like sitting down like this it could be any of
[10855.86s -> 10944.34s]  these it's crazy how like how many we've done in a row and they've all been greased we had the same
[10944.34s -> 10952.73s]  idea but whatever I mean you healed I did a little bit of double damage
[10996.23s -> 11007.46s]  that is actually almost exactly where I was clicking I saw this thing that was like an ad
[11007.46s -> 11013.86s]  for like the Mediterranean I can't lose like that that's fucking lame yeah really I was seriously
[11013.86s -> 11031.42s]  was almost exactly where that was and then you lose the whole thing oh yeah that was bad I just
[11031.42s -> 11036.70s]  had been holding a two-handed sword over my head just queuing it up charging it I let it go and
[11036.70s -> 11045.30s]  killed you I'm like an hour growing you for that this is the most powerful I've ever been
[11047.40s -> 11061.88s]  fucking slimy little dirt bag where are you where are you wait that's not friends oh shit
[11061.88s -> 11076.39s]  wrong flag yeah I there were Russian butters I wear that's the wrong flag yeah I know I say
[11076.39s -> 11080.07s]  this often but as a well-traveled man I'm pretty sure I've been here before
[11083.77s -> 11096.70s]  I stayed in this house Coca-Cola that's actually a big
[11099.18s -> 11142.18s]  to me again oh I was closer what's it Aloha like Guam again I keep doing this exaggerated like
[11142.18s -> 11148.55s]  annoying hog face I'm probably pissing off so many people they don't know it's exaggerated
[11149.35s -> 11179.06s]  I don't know where it is there is I think I fucked up damn that was not bad for like
[11179.06s -> 11190.42s]  guessing within five seconds I must go to on Norway how did you guess that close goddamn
[11190.42s -> 11197.66s]  because I saw nl and I saw the point I didn't see anything I saw like one word and I was like
[11197.66s -> 11205.02s]  ah somewhere around here why did I go this way what was wrong with me I was distracted by my own
[11205.74s -> 11209.34s]  my own talk this could be a lot of different places unfortunately
[11209.98s -> 11220.54s]  I have a feeling you actually I don't know I don't know how I feel like you are not going
[11220.54s -> 11227.91s]  to be able to I actually feel like I have a weird kind of wild guess here it's not that wild so I
[11227.91s -> 11241.22s]  think I'm just going to go for it and see if I can screw you over right okay it's always grease
[11242.26s -> 11270.65s]  healing round oh dude wild onion trees really are you serious
[11270.81s -> 11290.42s]  guys you did what you just clicked random place in the middle of Russia well I'm not I'm not going
[11290.42s -> 11324.95s]  to get like a bigger clue by spending more time I know my limits it's gonna be hard I feel like
[11324.95s -> 11350.58s]  it shouldn't be yeah with uh I don't want to say it serious oh shit um um um okay yep
[11350.58s -> 11359.38s]  so I had a little bit more time I might have been able to do it
[11360.87s -> 11365.27s]  it's always grease it's actually really not a bad place to click because it could be right
[11365.27s -> 11385.24s]  in the middle the uh the rooftop very grease I feel like I'm gonna die you're right I just
[11385.24s -> 11389.64s]  felt like you were gonna like see something in this city and instantly destroy them like that
[11390.20s -> 11402.97s]  yep oh this is so far down into South America are you kidding me really you got there closer
[11402.97s -> 11430.36s]  than I did how is uh a football bus I could totally go to school here and then play demons
[11430.36s -> 11470.10s]  on my off time such a small road really fucking cool looking actually I was gonna stay Tokyo but
[11470.10s -> 11482.26s]  I was like there's no way it's like it's Tokyo like every time I mean they must have a higher
[11482.34s -> 11488.86s]  density of you know you know cars driving around it fuck
[11504.44s -> 11516.50s]  Jesus you're fucking dead I went too fast I saw Slovenia Slovakia I went too fast I that was
[11516.50s -> 11521.93s]  based off the last name on a grave state like I looked over immediately I would have killed
[11521.93s -> 11529.85s]  you immediately I just I thought it was blurred out a little it was like it was Slovia god damn
[11529.85s -> 11537.06s]  you're dead how does it feel last one okay truly the final one for real it was actually a lot of
[11537.06s -> 11541.70s]  fun to do like I I don't think I would enjoy this so much uh single player it is really fun yeah
[11541.70s -> 11551.06s]  this is the true final one see this game is fun see I told you I got food on the way to okay well
[11551.06s -> 11554.26s]  it's like the competitive aspect you're trying to do it in a hurry like the whole just sit there
[11554.26s -> 11560.26s]  for 30 minutes and pause and be a streamer kind of situation it's not doing it for me he has
[11560.26s -> 11565.70s]  streamer yeah we're gonna like pause and tell oh wait you know you don't know what you're talking
[11565.70s -> 11569.86s]  about wait wait wait there's big this this thing you grew up with I grew up with you didn't grow
[11569.86s -> 11576.84s]  up with that like that's weird for you so everybody didn't do this one thing that I always did as a
[11576.84s -> 11611.56s]  child what you gotta I feel like this is gonna annihilate you main yeah why would they say
[11611.56s -> 11621.06s]  Quebec city on it and it's in Montreal uh I don't know I'm surprised that I got so like was was so
[11621.06s -> 11626.10s]  competitive with that guess that was like 100 like I have no fucking clue these houses look
[11626.10s -> 11627.14s]  look expensive
[11632.15s -> 11657.21s]  what I'm learning is that I need to like educate myself and stop being so dumb about
[11658.17s -> 11685.64s]  any country that uses this language that's what I've learned today literally only one country
[11685.72s -> 11689.30s]  don't tell me that you're making it up
[11692.50s -> 11700.10s]  that's great
[11712.46s -> 11721.03s]  I was over there too I was right there but like I can't tell
[11739.56s -> 11747.96s]  I've got a huge hunch just from what I've seen
[11749.88s -> 11759.88s]  where that fucking sign just go no dude really there's no like it's it's something like that
[11759.96s -> 11775.34s]  wait yeah shit I gotta I have to guess what were you doing Florida you thought that was Florida
[11775.34s -> 11781.21s]  yeah left side cars I don't have a driver's license that does that's not the first thing I
[11781.21s -> 11808.62s]  look at Florida it might as well have been Florida all right uh too blurry yeah this one's kind of
[11808.62s -> 11832.68s]  looking like Florida too that's too blurry I can't read it's too blurry too I too blurry
[11845.34s -> 11870.38s]  it's too blurry I can't read it um um uh I'm just gonna I'm literally just gonna pick I'm
[11870.38s -> 11878.49s]  gonna just take it I'm gonna take a guess I'm just guessing yeah I don't think it was that far south
[11878.49s -> 11914.14s]  all the signs were all I couldn't read them you don't even know you really don't I really
[11914.14s -> 11916.54s]  don't you literally just did that and like now I have to like do this
[11917.02s -> 11949.10s]  yeah of course it is of course it's a heal round fucking where did I see this before
[11949.90s -> 11966.07s]  oh you are you're fucked really
[11969.96s -> 11977.51s]  it's 26 damage to you okay how come the ones that I beat you in I you like are right next to me
[11977.51s -> 12008.14s]  they're the easy ones and you can only do the easy ones music is very tense really you really
[12008.14s -> 12016.06s]  like light the fire under you I like the hunt for trying to quickly figure out like where the
[12016.06s -> 12035.61s]  most information would be I know right desperately desperately searching I don't think I have it
[12035.61s -> 12070.87s]  right I thought I did immediately but I don't think so now of course it's your oh look it's
[12070.87s -> 12075.35s]  next to Paris it's right next to London right next to Paris I got it I saw a road map that was
[12075.35s -> 12086.84s]  kind of going that angle and I just tried to pick one I saw a road map you fuck they're always like
[12086.84s -> 12115.02s]  right next to Paris right next to London right next to like all the major cities who has any idea
[12116.14s -> 12123.27s]  vague idea I have a vague idea too but how would you in some architectural
[12125.35s -> 12126.65s]  but also yeah
[12151.22s -> 12158.42s]  you're fucking dead dude honestly you just you and his one isn't happening we're like really really
[12158.42s -> 12165.37s]  close like the first four or five rounds so far away and then the quadruple damage rolls around
[12165.37s -> 12170.65s]  and you're like equally as fucking wrong but you're still you still do quadruple and I'd lose
[12170.65s -> 12178.97s]  so just get a little bit closer again yeah winner takes all winner takes all four million community
[12178.97s -> 12254.07s]  subs all right this is it final one this is for all the marbles let's go yeah I feel like I went
[12254.07s -> 12258.39s]  down the wrong road and I'm never going to see a sign anywhere down here and you're going to
[12258.39s -> 12285.64s]  figure something out soon that I'm not going to know I knew it had to be somewhere like down here
[12286.62s -> 12291.02s]  yeah I was going to put it in Glasgow honestly and then I was like I'm going to put it close to
[12291.02s -> 12325.10s]  the middle in case I'm wrong most improved one turn around turn around turn around turn around
[12326.22s -> 12355.88s]  what I can't read this yeah that's the clue that's how I know where we are shit there's a flag
[12355.88s -> 12372.20s]  right there what is it oh my god it's switzerland what yeah so unlike the fourth round where the
[12372.20s -> 12386.33s]  quad damages what did you even click on where was that Singapore why was there a switzerland flag
[12386.33s -> 12390.41s]  there was a swift there was a flag it seemed like it was near an airport or something
[12392.01s -> 12400.49s]  it was the swiss embassy that's so fucking annoying all right I gotta get it together
[12403.32s -> 12409.56s]  I see the one flag it's like the swiss flag and it's the embassy in Singapore where is this
[12410.12s -> 12422.42s]  why don't I know where this is it was somewhere in here I don't fucking remember dude you can't
[12422.42s -> 12428.23s]  be serious you're gonna I'm as over I lose I have absolutely no idea what this is I was gonna put
[12428.23s -> 12436.07s]  it right in the middle of China I'm on the screen yeah I hi what are you doing I I had no I didn't
[12436.07s -> 12441.67s]  even have a chance that one didn't count that one sucked I turned the corner to a giant mall of
[12441.67s -> 12447.45s]  Montenegro yeah but okay so I turned around and I see like the swiss flag on a building and all
[12447.45s -> 12453.54s]  of a sudden no sorry that's the embassy dickhead okay so you want one more one more okay my food's

[12515.75s -> 12527.56s]  have an idea yeah here it feels like if I just guess I'm pretty close but you can't fuck up a
[12527.64s -> 12572.86s]  guest here as humanly possible yeah I think I think I'm gonna be pretty close I mean it could
[12572.86s -> 12597.45s]  it I don't it could be anything though hold on if I could click in any faster than this oh come on
[12597.45s -> 12612.68s]  it was Florida it was god it was Georgia and you know it it was not Georgia palm trees I'm a hobbit
[12612.68s -> 12617.00s]  man I just have my comfortable little sofa and my little spot and I wanted to have my books and I
[12617.00s -> 12646.10s]  don't care I'm like why are you so mad because I got it I thought I had it right he doesn't know
[12646.10s -> 12656.47s]  he doesn't fucking know I'm guessing you just guessed dude really I can guess you're way better
[12656.47s -> 12665.02s]  than you can guess really I don't have any idea I have no idea I actually have absolutely no clue
[12665.66s -> 12672.30s]  oh and apparently I was supposed to see it apparently I was thinking I don't know like
[12673.02s -> 12694.42s]  one of the Carolinas I can't guess good this one has to be Greece imagine you clicked Greece
[12719.06s -> 12725.61s]  I got an idea oh I absolutely have an idea oh you better believe that I have an idea
[12726.49s -> 12766.98s]  fucking sub work from somewhere in NA literally all of these are in NA you're gonna have to narrow
[12766.98s -> 12770.74s]  it down a little bit more than that I think I think it needs a little more narrowing down
[12770.74s -> 12779.90s]  because it could be there's a few places this could be I have yeah but I don't have a lock on
[12797.53s -> 12799.37s]  I pretty much have to just click now
[12806.07s -> 12811.83s]  what the dude the car that we started next to pointing out the red truck that we started next
[12811.83s -> 12816.79s]  to had Pennsylvania on it but there was a church across from a church across from a church
[12818.39s -> 12826.09s]  that's very like up in that area too like all of the east coast is all of the churches
[12844.68s -> 12851.90s]  hey slow down slow down dude come on and if you're not from us like how political all this shit
[12851.90s -> 12856.06s]  honestly is where every single lawn has like vote for this person vote for this person we're not
[12856.06s -> 12868.78s]  seeing that anywhere else this guy had an Obama shirt on what did you get what what do you what
[12868.78s -> 12874.81s]  what kind of genre of food do you have I got this place called Austin Burger Company I never heard
[12875.29s -> 12880.41s]  of it but Boston Burger Company is the best burger I'm hoping I think me and Holly are
[12880.41s -> 12897.29s]  gonna get McDonald's okay that's fantastic there's no there's nothing giving me any information here
[12906.49s -> 12911.14s]  is that a guess or did you see a sign or something we'll see how much of a guess
[12911.14s -> 12920.06s]  it was when we see how close I am I don't know right okay I mean it was the poverty
[12920.70s -> 12925.64s]  I gotta get you right here this is the next round after this I gotta get you
[12926.20s -> 12974.07s]  it's always on the fucking healing rounds okay I always like clean it up on the healing
[12974.07s -> 12981.40s]  seriously like this I would have wiped them out like five times yeah I bet
[12981.40s -> 12987.61s]  you didn't even click on Santa Monica Boulevard by the way I couldn't find the street I like
[12987.61s -> 13026.10s]  didn't even move once I didn't see what cross street was there's no way I lose
[13026.10s -> 13031.35s]  is
[13031.35s -> 13039.35s]  St. Petersburg it was on one of the trash cans oh I don't even know what that is
[13040.63s -> 13050.07s]  okay we're walling in we're walling in citizens by the way how do I click on the like like within
[13050.07s -> 13055.05s]  like five miles of the city and it's triple damage and you still like because I wasn't
[13055.05s -> 13091.35s]  not that far off I think St. Petersburg is in Russia what how do you oh every time it's
[13091.35s -> 13097.75s]  times four damage you you immediately know where to go you're gonna die it's times three by the way
[13099.74s -> 13107.66s]  how the fuck is three how is it even possible you're dead you're gonna have to hold that
[13109.02s -> 13112.62s]  every time or this motherfucker just guesses immediately and gets it right immediately you
[13112.62s -> 13118.92s]  just must know where this stuff is I saw a sign said Louisiana on a mini mart you're just getting
[13118.92s -> 13125.16s]  lucky every fourth round every fifth round oh I guess I just keep getting luckier than you
[13125.16s -> 13131.50s]  it was sucked to be so unlucky it's I know it sucks man I'd stop my totally five times one more
[13131.50s -> 13142.57s]  oh I gotta grab my food actually this time yeah all right you run it you look back and you see
[13142.57s -> 13146.89s]  every fifth round every fifth round it's like five seconds to go by and then it's
[13157.56s -> 13165.22s]  do famous places okay that's fun oh we're making this 20 seconds I feel like I have a I feel like
[13165.22s -> 13169.38s]  I have a better chance of beating you if we're in America because Ashley keeps telling me she's
[13169.38s -> 13177.91s]  gonna go on the run and I really practice how to locate her this is famous places in the world
[13177.91s -> 13183.61s]  apparently which good luck I don't think I'm gonna be able to get any of these uh the more famous it
[13183.61s -> 13189.03s]  is the more likely I have no idea I know I know this one right off the bat too bad it's not round
[13189.03s -> 13203.74s]  fucking five here's the problem though I don't actually know where the fuck this place is
[13203.74s -> 13211.26s]  well take your time I got some soggy fries
[13218.62s -> 13240.90s]  where is it where is this place I don't I actually don't fucking know where it is I know what I know
[13240.90s -> 13247.53s]  this exact monument thing but I don't know where it is on a map yeah I don't know either I think
[13247.53s -> 13254.07s]  that's it oh my god I don't know where it is I don't know it's I don't know where it is
[13254.07s -> 13261.77s]  fucking god damn it's the tallest building in the world yeah I the wrong like bay for Dubai
[13261.77s -> 13265.53s]  it's the I knew that I was wrong I zoomed in I didn't see it I was like that's weird
[13265.53s -> 13277.46s]  oh you gotta get like the street I know seriously
[13321.59s -> 13331.66s]  oh fuck you you don't know oh nice good job I didn't bother to look for the specifics
[13331.66s -> 13334.30s]  I just said fuck you for no reason that was like rude
[13345.67s -> 13359.58s]  nope um you actually know what this is no I see you in guest land I know it's somewhere
[13360.62s -> 13364.84s]  please stop throwing
[13370.90s -> 13392.25s]  what come on guys is a burger is it good is food good yeah it's pretty good it's whatever this is
[13392.25s -> 13414.87s]  this thing here my connection sucks so I can't even see it's all blurred out how do we both
[13414.87s -> 13427.22s]  get zero I was closer I don't like this one I'm too stupid I don't know anything is that like
[13427.22s -> 13439.18s]  famous um it's a famous uh there's bridge this is not easy is this the London bridge
[13439.90s -> 13457.93s]  let's give it away it is why don't I say that out loud I don't know neither like we're either
[13457.93s -> 13469.72s]  gonna need no one's gonna score points I want a real game okay well um the real question is
[13470.36s -> 13477.88s]  where where are these oh I fucking okay did you get it wrong yeah I put it in Las Vegas
[13481.26s -> 13494.12s]  I don't know where they are though okay yeah it's Cairo did I just kill you yeah so not
[13495.00s -> 13498.68s]  the famous pyramids of Egypt are not in Libya no they aren't
[13501.51s -> 13505.03s]  I want to do another real one what you don't want to do a real one not monuments I don't I
[13505.03s -> 13509.59s]  don't like famous places famous places are lame okay I like to support local business
[13509.59s -> 13515.75s]  United States again um oh let's see if you want to yeah all right this is actually the last one
[13515.75s -> 13519.35s]  because I'm starving plus it's getting really late it's been a lot of fun though
[13519.91s -> 13547.69s]  maybe this is United States yo no shit it is is it how's that one place the other place
[13547.69s -> 13575.19s]  the lamer place no no I just I need an extra minute
[13577.99s -> 13583.11s]  that's like we're still doing famous places I that was in my brain for some reason
[13585.67s -> 13597.35s]  I clicked central New Jersey oops the first two rounds don't even matter it's round eight that
[13597.35s -> 13623.83s]  is the only one that matters why are you so mad about that getting a tree this could be
[13630.95s -> 13634.39s]  I know I understand that you're like taking a bite and just guessing randomly
[13634.39s -> 13646.33s]  but yeah but I'm still gonna beat yourself like does it really matter all right we both
[13646.33s -> 13649.05s]  making the same thing I was thinking like Portland
[13650.09s -> 13657.37s]  Linda area you just said you don't even think that these rounds matter yeah but I mean whatever
[13669.59s -> 13670.39s]  yeah that's one degrees
[13703.85s -> 13709.53s]  I know you can't look at license plates that's kind of um cannot that's some NSA level stuff
[13709.53s -> 13724.79s]  so I this actually might be I don't want to say it why does the sun have to be so
[13725.83s -> 13729.59s]  bright every sign I've looked at when you zoom in it's like a pure white sign
[13739.13s -> 13746.33s]  yeah I gotta get I'm getting away from the sun he's using the sun evasion technique
[13747.99s -> 13787.45s]  okay I'm dead end this is such a average place an average city yeah but with like no commercial
[13787.45s -> 13796.46s]  areas so you can't actually see like business addresses or anything like that everything's
[13796.46s -> 13838.36s]  just blown up by the sun I'm going off this way I don't know
[13842.97s -> 13849.30s]  I mean I could I'm just gonna go for it here I mean this round doesn't matter right
[13849.30s -> 13852.98s]  not necessarily none of the rounds matter not until it's four times damage and I win
[13854.10s -> 13880.23s]  okay I was thinking like all right yeah San Diego or whatever I was thinking like
[13880.23s -> 13897.96s]  Paso or El Paso said La Mesa I don't know what that is I'm I like can't move down this road
[13897.96s -> 13923.16s]  yeah it's hard to drive in either direction oh I'm ready to guess this is yeah this is bad
[13924.04s -> 13948.71s]  trying to eat over here oh I see something get closer I'm going for it I just want to get to
[13948.71s -> 13957.34s]  this one building I'm going for it I'm going for it I'm going for it I'm going for it I'm just
[13957.34s -> 13975.32s]  gonna say somewhere like around here this is a lot of trees wow I mean Vermont New Hampshire
[13975.32s -> 13987.78s]  look I mean that's what it looks like during like the spring and summer is that snow or
[13987.78s -> 13996.86s]  solar ash I don't know sir I think it might be solar ash okay then I think I know where we are
[13996.86s -> 14032.01s]  still a shitload of people and it's late I'm surprised I don't know where this would be but
[14032.01s -> 14042.30s]  I'll say like somewhere around here really you thought you saw a sign for St. Louis didn't you
[14043.58s -> 14074.62s]  I did it was a healing room whatever none of the rounds matter easy I got really lucky with that
[14074.62s -> 14109.90s]  St. Louis I had no idea where I was America it's very America it's a little bit too America
[14110.78s -> 14127.16s]  the thing is I don't know where that is I think it's here I'm pretty sure it's like up here
[14127.16s -> 14138.09s]  I think it's like up here I'm like 99.9 percent certain that's like here I'm about to get
[14138.09s -> 14156.12s]  destroyed is it right here or is it like up here yeah Kentucky oh what really yeah that's a lot
[14156.12s -> 14161.96s]  man no I mean on two times damage that was all my life because I pretty much was I literally got
[14161.96s -> 14167.21s]  like almost the exact place yeah I really thought it was up there too but I wanted to
[14167.21s -> 14173.11s]  put somewhere more middle yeah I was very unsure that's crazy we're gonna play one more right
[14173.11s -> 14178.04s]  I gotta call it man I gotta go get your you're eating I haven't eaten all day yeah that's why
[14178.04s -> 14197.56s]  we can do one more all right this is the last one real everybody's betting all the doubters
[14197.56s -> 14226.82s]  right you mean you're just so confident and you lose all your points this photo brother lives here
[14227.70s -> 14235.82s]  where can you drive that fast on the highway the speed limit on the highway is that's
[14235.82s -> 14241.56s]  fucking crazy you know where this is I don't know where this is I know the general area
[14243.88s -> 14247.40s]  I'm gonna be closer than you and it's only the first round and you're gonna heal this and like
[14247.40s -> 14275.94s]  my you gotta go so the speed limit in Idaho on highways is 75 so I just said that out loud
[14275.94s -> 14280.10s]  what an idiot I don't know what you said
[14291.99s -> 14305.75s]  wait what they usually say what like first like town or county or whatever
[14308.54s -> 14323.80s]  where is that I don't know
[14331.91s -> 14334.63s]  I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know
[14335.03s -> 14335.53s]  no
[14338.92s -> 14346.09s]  it looks like Philadelphia like Pennsylvania or something yeah I found out I would have never
[14346.09s -> 14358.54s]  guessed California until I saw the sign I was originally thinking like Georgia it's
[14358.54s -> 14363.61s]  burger something oh this is a hiking trail or whatever that how are we supposed to know what
[14363.61s -> 14391.05s]  this is that's part of the fun noticing some birch looking pretty close to Montenegro again
[14391.05s -> 14407.80s]  I almost want to say it's a dead end at the edge I mean what
[14409.64s -> 14420.06s]  you actually might win right now you find something that I don't
[14420.78s -> 14423.42s]  I mean there's nothing out here I don't think you have to worry about that
[14431.43s -> 14435.48s]  yeah actually I'm at another dead end
[14435.48s -> 14451.26s]  yeah what was sold over here I'm just going for what I would
[14451.82s -> 14454.06s]  I mean I'm just gonna go for it like somewhere like up here
[14458.71s -> 14487.38s]  oh shit I didn't really put Alaska on here I forgot it was a thing what is that
[14489.66s -> 14496.46s]  whoa I've got you too bad it's just a shitty healing round
[14497.02s -> 14500.76s]  it's too bad it's just a stupid shitty healing round
[14510.01s -> 14515.30s]  is it do I just kill you I'm closer than you you're closer than me
[14515.30s -> 14526.01s]  bullshit how did you find that out a couple buildings had Hawaiian on it and I picked the
[14526.01s -> 14533.43s]  biggest Hawaiian city because it was a big city which I had no idea Honolulu was that big of a
[14534.23s -> 14559.82s]  city be serious let me break I mean I'm full health you better guess well
[14567.67s -> 14590.15s]  81 double damage it begins you ready this is where it actually matters yeah a lot of cars
[14590.15s -> 14650.33s]  here a lot of endless roads a lot of cars Home Depot here this could be anywhere I mean it could
[14650.33s -> 14671.54s]  be it could be anywhere in this entire country yeah wait you actually got it no you do not
[14671.62s -> 14682.62s]  two times damage are you about to win oh it's Seattle god damn it what Houston
[14684.62s -> 14686.78s]  this space needle was just on there
[14694.06s -> 14699.38s]  that's the space needle right there that's the space needle in Seattle
[14699.38s -> 14706.14s]  does Houston have a space needle too Houston's a pretty big city look at that is the god look
[14706.14s -> 14717.80s]  at this this right here that you can't see it that well but that is the space needle
[14717.80s -> 14729.24s]  that's not a pen that is a needle do you see this thing right here that's the space needle
[14729.24s -> 14740.12s]  that's an like an it is actually I see what are you talking about am I crazy that's literally
[14740.84s -> 14746.60s]  like the space needle or like the stratosphere in Vegas it's one of those like spaceship things
[14746.60s -> 14757.88s]  with the needle on top oh come on that's not a pen I think it's an arrow pointing upwards dude
[14757.88s -> 14763.51s]  no it's not that is the space needle okay we'll go back to Houston and find that street and zoom
[14763.51s -> 14771.32s]  in and prove it why would you have the space needle or the stratosphere in Houston as your
[14771.32s -> 14781.40s]  logo uh I don't know how come every single pizza place in New Jersey is a New York pizza
[14781.40s -> 14792.07s]  it is the space needle that's what I'm saying all right that's it call those guys up and ask
[14796.12s -> 14800.44s]  all right that's it that's it maybe the company's from Seattle but like I thought it was like oh
[14800.44s -> 14814.42s]  space needle whatever yeah yeah maybe I'll see you around kid no it was a lot of fun
