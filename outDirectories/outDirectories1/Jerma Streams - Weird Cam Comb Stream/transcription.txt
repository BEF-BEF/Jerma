[4.34s -> 16.78s]  Hello. Hi. How are you? Oh, hello. Want to start at 12, but it's 12.30. Whatever. It's a couple.
[16.78s -> 26.46s]  Ah, it's a half hour. It's all right. Bear with me for a second. I'm going to make everybody very upset,
[26.46s -> 37.14s]  okay? Well, actually, not really. Not really. I know that today I was going to stream yesterday
[37.14s -> 43.48s]  modded Skyrim. I was thinking about it. Some of the mods and some of the people in the community
[43.48s -> 50.06s]  have helped put together a list of a hundred something mods for Skyrim. I spent the better
[50.06s -> 58.79s]  half of the last day or so for getting them all. And I, some of them don't work. Some of them
[58.79s -> 66.12s]  fuck up the game. So it's going to take a little bit longer. And, and not only will there be a
[66.12s -> 74.04s]  shitload of mods on that Skyrim mod mayhem night, I think I'm actually going to get access to
[74.04s -> 79.94s]  Ghost Commander, or if you don't know Ghost Commander, Kraken. Kraken's extension for
[79.94s -> 85.48s]  Skyrim. So it's good that we're going to take a little bit longer because we'll get access
[85.48s -> 91.99s]  to that too, probably. Just going to let it sit for a little bit. I want to get some more mods,
[91.99s -> 98.10s]  make sure they all work. Because I, okay, I opened up the game and I had literally no idea
[98.10s -> 102.15s]  what was going on. It was just a mess. And I'm like, is this like, this is going to be funny
[102.15s -> 106.55s]  for five seconds. They need, they need a little bit more time in the oven. Okay. Let's just put
[106.55s -> 112.38s]  it that way. It's, it would have been funny for literally five seconds and we all would have gone,
[112.38s -> 117.46s]  oh, that's crazy. That's funny. All right. Well now what? So I'd rather have more elaborate things
[117.46s -> 124.92s]  going on and get some more, more time on it. So today, I don't have very much time today.
[124.92s -> 130.65s]  I've got a lot of things going on over the next few days into the weekend, but I did want to hang
[130.65s -> 137.40s]  out and we're going to do something called a comb stream. A lot of new viewers. Look at all these
[137.40s -> 145.69s]  new viewers that don't know what this is. When did you start watching? 2018? Please don't leave.
[145.69s -> 151.05s]  Like you've been incredible for the channel and the community's grown immensely. So like you guys
[151.05s -> 157.21s]  are awesome. Thanks for coming. A comb stream is, is this. Well, hold on. Let me tweet it first.
[161.27s -> 178.79s]  Hold on. Oh, give me a second. I'll be right back. What the fuck is this new Twitter shit?
[179.35s -> 185.90s]  I'm writing a tweet and it's like public or what do you mean public? What are you talking about?
[186.54s -> 193.19s]  This is freaking me out. I don't like this. This is a new feature on Twitter. What is this? Public
[194.15s -> 203.56s]  or my Twitter circle. What the fuck does that mean? I don't have a Twitter circle. What?
[205.98s -> 222.63s]  Okay. Anyways, uh, short hangout stream. Come say hi with a big smiley face.
[227.91s -> 236.87s]  It's so funny. All right. I'm so sorry, but listen, this is kind of funny. So if you've been
[237.51s -> 241.59s]  a few days ago, two or three days ago, right? When I last streamed, it's like, oh, mod night.
[241.59s -> 247.43s]  I'm going to get modded GTA, modded Elden Ring, modded Skyrim. It's going to be fucking crazy.
[247.43s -> 252.63s]  Mod night, hundreds of mods. It's going to be insane. And, and you don't, you know, you don't
[252.63s -> 260.06s]  pay any attention after that. And you see on Twitter here, short hangout stream. Come say hi.
[260.70s -> 269.21s]  Like what? What are you, what are you talking about? Where that's what you're doing today?
[269.69s -> 280.78s]  A short hangout stream, but I got a baseball update for you. So before we get started,
[280.78s -> 287.50s]  baseball, if you don't know baseball's seen a little bit of a rocky road here. Um, they had
[287.50s -> 295.75s]  some venue problems trying to still get the show paid for. It's been kind of rough with the show
[296.47s -> 300.95s]  creatively. This thing's ready to go. It's ready. It's been ready for a long fucking time.
[301.98s -> 311.24s]  But we keep running into problems, but I think I can safely say it's still happening in July.
[311.24s -> 318.18s]  We're really trying to really lock in the 24th, July 24th. And I think I mean it this time.
[321.64s -> 328.34s]  We just, behind the scenes is a lot going on and it's been pretty stressful. Nothing I really,
[328.34s -> 334.82s]  really speak of on stream. Uh, but we've had multiple different issues with trying to,
[334.82s -> 341.85s]  like I said, get the show paid for and get the right venue for it. And it's, we've gone back
[341.85s -> 349.46s]  and forth. It's been kind of a mess, but July 24th is the new day that we're trying to lock in.
[349.46s -> 355.82s]  And I've really, me and Community Jake obviously have been going back and forth. And with this
[355.82s -> 361.86s]  show, I need to get this show off the ground before August. I ain't, this show is, I'm not
[361.94s -> 372.18s]  canceling this show. There's no way I will do this show in my backyard. Okay. But no,
[372.18s -> 376.62s]  we're not going to worry about that. Uh, it's going to be a great show. I'm really looking
[376.62s -> 380.14s]  forward to it. I think it's going to be really, really fun. I think a lot of people are potentially
[380.14s -> 385.34s]  sleeping on this show. And some people are like, Oh, it's just a baseball show. Who cares? You'll
[385.34s -> 392.25s]  see. It's going to be a really fun time. But, uh, that's that update. Hopefully July 24th.
[392.25s -> 398.39s]  I just found that out today. I'm on calls, man. Cause I'm on phone calls. You understand? Like
[398.39s -> 410.20s]  it's like, it's every fucking 10 seconds. And I got to call my mother too. I'm not just not
[410.20s -> 421.51s]  going to call my mother. Oh shit. I forgot to tweet. Hold on. Give me a second. New noise.
[421.51s -> 441.40s]  Now that's the same noise repackaged like three times. Okay. It's a Skype call. No. All right.
[441.40s -> 444.84s]  So what we're going to do today. Hold on. Let me just clear my throat for a sec. I don't want
[444.84s -> 453.37s]  you to hear that. So today I don't really have a plan and I figured why not just hang out. I don't
[453.37s -> 460.36s]  have that much time today and I'm trying to get a lot of things off the ground over the next few
[460.36s -> 467.69s]  days as well. So let's just chill. Let's hang out. Let's do a comb stream. Comb streams are exactly
[467.69s -> 478.55s]  this. How are you? That's where I sit here and I put a comb in my hair and we, we sit her in
[478.55s -> 486.65s]  and do nothing. I'm not kidding. That's what this is. This is what it is. This is what the show is
[486.65s -> 500.82s]  today. I actually did just get a haircut recently. Your cam is skewed. Yeah. Why do I have like a
[500.82s -> 509.67s]  fucking hourglass head? What's happening? This isn't this, this camera. I don't like this new
[509.67s -> 521.51s]  camera. I don't like this new camera. It makes me look weird. I have a five head. It really does
[521.51s -> 526.63s]  look weird. I don't understand this camera and this thing was expensive. This was not cheap.
[526.63s -> 546.54s]  Did you have a wig on? No, I just, just got my haircut. What do you guys think? I'm a fucking
[546.54s -> 555.03s]  weird looking guy. You got the same comb. All right. I also shaved too. So that's why I just
[555.03s -> 563.38s]  look equally as different. 144 P Andy. This camera is not 144 P. This camera is very expensive and
[563.38s -> 571.70s]  it's very high quality. You look like 20. Well, good. Cause when I'm 50, I'll look 40 and that
[571.70s -> 579.77s]  makes me happy. When I'm 55 years old, I'll be, I'll be 30. You look strange and off putting,
[579.77s -> 588.82s]  but because I got fucking messed up hair, I just got, okay, let me ask you a question. Those of
[588.82s -> 595.56s]  you that get your hair cut every time I get my haircut, the first three days of the force,
[595.56s -> 602.71s]  the first like five days, I look horrible. I hate the way I look and I need my hair has to grow out
[602.71s -> 608.97s]  into the haircut for like a week before I look like a normal person. Does that make sense? So I
[608.97s -> 614.49s]  need to wait a week for this to grow up for me to look like a normal human being. Do you have lip
[614.49s -> 629.77s]  gloss on? Yes. Sure. It's coconut lip balm. Okay. Get the correct cut next time. There's no correct
[629.77s -> 641.72s]  haircut. Get the correct haircut next time. I got to get my haircut however I want. It also doesn't
[641.72s -> 647.62s]  help, right? Here's another thing. So it doesn't help that I have a new hairstylist every single
[647.62s -> 658.47s]  time I get a haircut and I get a card every time. So I go in to get my haircut because I last minute
[658.47s -> 664.25s]  Andy, right? I don't get my haircut for two or three months and I go, fuck man, I really need a
[664.25s -> 669.19s]  haircut. Okay. So let me get a haircut. I guess I'm going to see if I can do, can anybody do a walk
[669.19s -> 679.16s]  in today? And I do a walk in today every single time I need to get my haircut. I know. And I keep
[679.16s -> 689.99s]  saying I don't want to do that anymore. I go to, I go to a salon. I don't go to a barber. Just don't
[689.99s -> 700.07s]  do that. Just get a dedicated stylist. I say that every time, but it never happens because two months
[700.07s -> 707.50s]  will go by and I just, I don't care about my haircut anymore. So I just forget and I don't care. And
[707.50s -> 713.67s]  I go, oh, all right. So I need to get my haircut. Oh shit. I want to get my haircut today. Not like
[713.67s -> 723.24s]  three days from now, not a week from now. You get a bald spot. I mean, I got a, I got a bald head, dude.
[723.24s -> 731.96s]  Relax. What's on the shirt? Oh, that's a half shelves ago. Go big pancake. Your features are
[731.96s -> 744.81s]  too sharp. You look like Dennis Reynolds. No, I'll grow into it. I'll grow into it. And then I do,
[744.81s -> 750.02s]  I have a fresh shaved face. You're lucky I'm on camera like this. You're lucky I'm on camera
[750.02s -> 757.94s]  like this. I always have two days after I shave my face before I go on camera. And this webcam is
[757.94s -> 763.74s]  weird too. It's extra soft and weird contrast. This is, the camera is weird too. So that's the
[763.74s -> 770.87s]  problem. So what is a comb stream? We're just going to sit here and I'm going to just take your
[770.87s -> 782.95s]  questions. Not really. You get a weird head. Yeah, I know. I'm aware of that. It's really great. I
[782.95s -> 794.70s]  don't, I don't know why this thing was expensive too. What if I go like up this way? We're trying
[794.70s -> 811.06s]  a new hairstyle. It's just Donald Trump's hair on my head. You look like a conehead, maybe a little.
[811.06s -> 822.86s]  Is the camera, is the lens dirty? No, I need to grow into it. Fix the settings, please. There are
[822.86s -> 838.60s]  no, I can't fix the camera settings. There are no settings. The settings are so bare bones. I would
[838.60s -> 844.20s]  have to go get one of those third party programs that nobody wants to go download. Let me ask you
[844.20s -> 854.14s]  a question. Do you go get the third party, like let's say Logitech webcam software and install it
[854.14s -> 872.58s]  and use it? I don't know anybody that does that. How's that? Can we do a Reddit shelf tour? That's
[872.58s -> 901.82s]  actually a little bit better. Make it darker. What if I do this? It's the same color. Change the
[901.82s -> 915.90s]  sharpness. Drop it or increase it. That, okay, that way that looks way better. Raise it. No,
[915.90s -> 927.38s]  you don't want to raise the sharpness. That look like a fucking VHS tape. Does it like this weird
[927.38s -> 936.25s]  backlight compensation? You're at 985,000 Twitch followers. Holy shit, that's right, I am. Run it
[936.25s -> 944.09s]  through the hue cycle. It's grayed out. It's fine. Whatever. I don't care. I don't think I care about
[944.09s -> 957.21s]  the camera. It's a new, you know, it's a new haircut and I shaved my face literally last night.
[957.21s -> 966.57s]  I have a ring light up here. That thing doesn't really help, really at all. What have I got to
[966.57s -> 990.70s]  have for dinner? Porridge. I think a large porridge. I can't hide. Imagine me with a beard. You look
[990.70s -> 1013.93s]  like from the 1930s. AI dungeon looking guy. You look 17. You look like, oh, what did you say?
[1013.93s -> 1023.35s]  Do you remember? Hey, me and the boys from our soap were wondering what kind of soap you use
[1023.35s -> 1031.40s]  to clean your body. Uh, I like Irish spring. What are you talking about? Is this person real? Um,
[1031.40s -> 1041.29s]  I use just slime soap. I use slime soap. It's just, you know what I mean? It's just the,
[1042.81s -> 1052.23s]  it doesn't even lather up either. I'm so, my brother used to give me shit for this all the time.
[1052.23s -> 1057.80s]  We would have this, you know, the gel, the slime soap, right? And he would get so pissed off
[1057.80s -> 1063.88s]  because I would go through it so quickly. And if you like, stop just sliming the soap all over your
[1063.88s -> 1069.32s]  body, that's what you're doing. I can tell. Cause it's almost empty every time. So he was, you get
[1069.32s -> 1075.96s]  mad at me because there was just like this in the shower, there was just the, the gel soap and he
[1075.96s -> 1080.60s]  could like tell each week how much I was using. Cause he would pick it up and be like lighter.
[1083.21s -> 1086.25s]  He's like, you're sli- you're sliming it all over your body, aren't you? And I'm like,
[1087.40s -> 1095.70s]  no, I use the loofah. And that was full of shit. I don't use the loofah. I just sli- I just literally
[1095.70s -> 1111.64s]  slime it all over me. Stop sliming. I know, but it's so much easier. You sli- you're a slime.
[1111.64s -> 1121.32s]  Yeah. I mean like whatever. Omega lol. There we go. I got an omega lol out of you. You look fake
[1121.32s -> 1129.34s]  today. I'm not going to go over this anymore. Okay. I had a haircut. I had a clean shaved face
[1129.34s -> 1134.66s]  and I have a camera that has a permanent soft filter in it and I can't turn it off.
[1135.67s -> 1143.61s]  I'm going to go get the Logitech controller software. Let's go get it right now. I'm going
[1143.61s -> 1160.09s]  to go get it right now. What, what, what, what, what, what, what do I need? Stream is derailed.
[1160.09s -> 1164.33s]  The stream is this, this is the stream. It's just complete derailed. That's the whole thing.
[1164.89s -> 1170.76s]  All right. What am I looking for? Logitech webcam software. Wait, is this even a logitech? Yeah,
[1170.76s -> 1186.39s]  it is. Logitech webcam software. Where's the real germo? All right. Logitech capture video
[1186.39s -> 1196.04s]  and record software. Okay. Here it is. Download from Mac OS is first before windows. What the
[1196.04s -> 1210.42s]  fuck? Why do you look so young? Cause you guys never see me with a clean tooth to the bone.
[1210.42s -> 1215.30s]  You know what I mean? Like to the skin shaved face. I never let it happen. You never see it
[1215.38s -> 1222.02s]  ever, ever except for today. Except today. This is when you're seeing it. You're seeing clean,
[1222.74s -> 1237.14s]  smooth shaved face. I've never do this ever. Do you shave your eyebrows? No, I'm just very pale.
[1239.56s -> 1252.46s]  Okay. It looks good. I don't like the way that it looked like this. I prefer having a little bit of
[1253.50s -> 1260.02s]  shade, like a gruff, whatever it is. What was shade? What am I thinking? What's shadow? Five
[1260.02s -> 1271.78s]  o'clock shadow. Right. Shade. Yeah. I like, I like having a stubble. Yeah. Right. Scruff. Shade.
[1271.78s -> 1285.99s]  That's fine. Should we try some new hairstyles? What are you guys saying?
[1285.99s -> 1298.86s]  Dude, should I try like going down with it? Yeah. Eat spaghetti on stream. Oh dude. I was just
[1298.86s -> 1305.43s]  thinking about eating spaghetti on stream last night. I swear. I was thinking about eating
[1305.43s -> 1314.36s]  spaghetti on stream. You look like Ace Ventura. That's fine. That's okay. I also have a ring
[1314.36s -> 1318.36s]  light here. That's, that's putting even more light in my face, but it has to be there because
[1318.36s -> 1325.94s]  all webcams have just horseshit awful chips in them. All of them. It's been
[1325.94s -> 1333.58s]  fucking 10 years and they all look like they're 480p. And I'm sorry. I don't want to, I don't
[1333.58s -> 1337.42s]  want to plug a DSLR in here and point it at me and have the room heat up another 10 degrees
[1337.42s -> 1349.45s]  that it already is. Turn it off and let's see. All right. This is without the ring light. This
[1349.45s -> 1366.54s]  is what it looks like in here. Better? You look like a ghost. This is not better. No way. That
[1366.54s -> 1375.80s]  makes you look unwell. Well, cause now the white balance is wrong. Do some muscle flexing. All
[1375.80s -> 1394.71s]  right. This is a 2008 vlog. It really does look like a 2008 vlog. You're right. Turn it on,
[1394.71s -> 1403.05s]  please. You're scaring my sister. Maybe I, wait, what if I do this? That's, that's much better.
[1403.05s -> 1414.57s]  Isn't it? That seems like it's better. That's more realistic looking. Yeah. I think that looks
[1414.57s -> 1425.70s]  better. Yeah. It's a granny ass camera. Whatever. Do you even lift? Uh, not in about seven or eight
[1425.70s -> 1440.17s]  years. What if I do this? Hold on. Is it like zoomed in? Maybe that's another reason why.
[1441.37s -> 1448.20s]  Maybe if I like, that's probably better. What if I go back to see like, this is, this,
[1448.20s -> 1454.12s]  this looks normal now, right? This is you having the webcam like zoomed in and shit. This is like,
[1454.12s -> 1458.52s]  not what a person looks like. They look, this is what you look like now. For real. You look real
[1458.52s -> 1468.23s]  now. It's like, Hey guys. Hi. It looks weird. It's like people don't have conversations with each
[1468.23s -> 1475.10s]  other with like the iPhone reverse camera, right? Well, I guess you do with FaceTime, but I'm saying
[1475.10s -> 1479.75s]  like when you just talking to somebody, I don't look like this in real life. I don't look like
[1479.75s -> 1483.35s]  this in real life. You guys know what I look like in real life. You've seen the videos of me from
[1483.35s -> 1494.71s]  every angle. You have American girl teeth. What are you, what does that, what does that mean?
[1495.35s -> 1507.90s]  Exactly. You have American girl teeth. You mean like an American girl doll is what you're describing.
[1507.90s -> 1518.41s]  They're fake. I'm just like pull out my front teeth. Yeah. I've heard it all, man. You got big
[1518.41s -> 1533.43s]  teeth. You got a long head. Your nose is too much. I've heard it all. Hey dude, you got a long ass
[1533.43s -> 1542.90s]  head. That means my fucking brain can fit in here more. It might be squished vertically, but it's in
[1542.90s -> 1558.36s]  here. You look like a handsome. I don't look like this in real life. I swear to you. I don't look
[1558.36s -> 1562.68s]  like this in real life. I've got to get the fuck away from this. What you, I got to get away from
[1562.68s -> 1567.83s]  this. It's how long have you been streaming for? Like 30 minutes and we're still talking about how
[1567.83s -> 1573.00s]  I look. I haven't got like, I got kind of a long head. Like, all right. New question, please. New
[1573.00s -> 1585.46s]  question, please. Will you play five nights at, I'm sorry, will you play long face? Will you play
[1585.46s -> 1597.08s]  five nights at Freddy's again? No, never. What's my favorite movie? Ghostbusters 2 and then Gremlins
[1597.08s -> 1613.42s]  2 or depending on the day, Gremlins 2. Dermot, do something crazy. Do you have long nostrils?
[1615.48s -> 1624.39s]  Maybe a little. What do I think about the rapid growth of the channel in the last year or two?
[1625.38s -> 1637.83s]  Um, it's cool. It's, I mean, it's cool that more people are here. I just hope I can keep it up.
[1637.83s -> 1644.73s]  But I'm trying, okay. I'm trying to not just do, to not do anything different, right? It's really
[1644.73s -> 1651.30s]  easy to kind of, all right, let's real talk for a minute. It's really, the more people that are here,
[1651.30s -> 1655.61s]  it's almost like I got to, oh, I got to fucking, the show is going to be great. It has to be good.
[1655.61s -> 1658.97s]  I've got to, everything's going to be super funny. I have to, I got to try as hard as I can.
[1658.97s -> 1663.34s]  Everything's got, I got to try so hard. But then I try to run into the wall there and I go, don't
[1663.34s -> 1669.24s]  just fucking do what you've been doing normally, right? Um, it is, it is like kind of hard though.
[1669.24s -> 1677.74s]  I really don't want to have it kind of get in there and screw around with how I think and how
[1677.74s -> 1685.62s]  I do. And then it's not, I mean, it's not like the channel was unpopular before a year or two ago.
[1685.62s -> 1689.38s]  I, they would, there's, there's been a lot of people here for a long time. So I think I've
[1689.38s -> 1697.98s]  got, you're kind of used to it. So yeah, I'm, I think I'm doing okay. I hope so. And that,
[1697.98s -> 1702.18s]  I mean, that's up to you. That's up to you guys. I could sit here and go, you know, I think I'm
[1702.18s -> 1710.23s]  doing a pretty good job, but that's not for me to decide. Um, like I said, all I hope is,
[1712.09s -> 1717.83s]  I, you guys still think it's fun and funny and that's at the end of the day, that's it. Like,
[1717.83s -> 1727.34s]  cool. What are you talking about? Um, did you just open the stream and hear the word like,
[1727.34s -> 1738.94s]  uh, I know, don't be mean, don't be mean to anybody. You do get, and that's also like,
[1738.94s -> 1745.85s]  my schedule is kind of all over the place too. And, and like, I'll be honest with you,
[1745.85s -> 1749.29s]  me having a really erratic schedule where I stream maybe a couple of times a week, two,
[1749.29s -> 1757.32s]  three times a week, it kind of, it's hard to, let's just put it this way. It's hard to lock
[1757.32s -> 1764.57s]  in a lot of things with a lot of different potential companies and stuff. When I stream
[1764.57s -> 1772.55s]  kind of erratically, sporadically, like twice a week. So I'm just going to give 50 subs.
[1772.55s -> 1779.18s]  What the fuck? 50 subs from pixel cat. Thanks. I don't, and by the way, I don't shout out subs
[1779.18s -> 1790.14s]  or bits anymore, but I just did right there. Well, yeah. Um, if I can keep going, I'm going
[1790.14s -> 1800.44s]  to keep going. And I think it's, it's, it's going well now, but could I like, could I broadcast
[1800.44s -> 1806.58s]  every single day and get on like the grind? But I was, I, I think a lot of people forget this.
[1806.58s -> 1815.26s]  I did that already. I did, I was on the grind already five years ago, six years ago, back in
[1815.26s -> 1822.25s]  the YouTube days, I was making a video every other day. Every two days, there'd be a new video,
[1822.25s -> 1827.88s]  even into kind of the lat, like a few years ago on Twitch. And then the whole medical shit caused
[1827.88s -> 1835.53s]  a bunch of problems, which it still does. That didn't go away. So yeah. Um, I, I already did all
[1835.53s -> 1838.89s]  that. I already, you know what? I'm going to be, I'm going to do this every single fucking day,
[1838.89s -> 1848.33s]  all day. Like I'm just going to do what I want to do now. What's the medical shit? Well, I don't
[1848.33s -> 1854.73s]  want to get this. I don't want it to be like the medical recap, but I have chest and back pain that
[1854.73s -> 1860.98s]  has never been solved. I've been to, I took like four months off in a row, uh, back a couple of
[1860.98s -> 1865.93s]  years ago to try to figure it out. And I was told it could be this, it could be this, it could be
[1865.93s -> 1870.58s]  this, it could be this, it could be this. And I ruled out a lot of really bad things. So that's
[1870.58s -> 1887.03s]  good. Uh, I'm, I'm doing fine though. Are you in a better chair? I am. Uh, yeah, it's good. You have
[1887.03s -> 1894.06s]  costochondritis. Okay. But you might not. Okay. There's a hernia that's in your, uh, in your
[1894.06s -> 1899.96s]  hiatal area. I don't, we don't think it's that though. Okay. You know, there's this little bone
[1899.96s -> 1903.72s]  right here that maybe it's called the xiphoid and it could be, do you think, oh, is that what's
[1903.72s -> 1915.43s]  causing it? Oh, I don't know. But no, I'm in, I'm in a new chair. This thing's great. This is the
[1915.43s -> 1921.70s]  Herman Miller. I know we make jokes about it, but seriously, that keeps me propped up. There's this
[1921.70s -> 1926.81s]  little wedge that's right here that just kind of is right there to make it so I can't slouch.
[1926.81s -> 1936.17s]  So it's great. It's good. What does it say? What do you say? What do you say? What do you say?
[1936.17s -> 1940.81s]  Yeah, just throw questions. I don't care. Whatever. Were you ever nervous streaming and how did you
[1940.81s -> 1948.97s]  get over it? Yes, I was incredibly. Um, the first, I'd say the first six months I started streaming,
[1948.97s -> 1954.79s]  I came from the YouTube world, which the YouTube world is you can mess up as many times as you
[1954.79s -> 1962.87s]  fucking want. You can mess up a hundred times in a row, a hundred times in a row, and you could
[1962.87s -> 1970.73s]  fix it. And it would be easy and nobody cares. And nobody knows on stream. You can't be in the
[1970.73s -> 1980.58s]  middle of a sentence and go, um, three, one, two, three. Okay. So that doesn't work. Um, so it's,
[1980.58s -> 1988.62s]  it took a little bit of getting used to that because I, for five or six years,
[1988.62s -> 1995.83s]  I was used to the whole YouTube thing where I could just screw up a hundred times.
[1995.83s -> 2002.20s]  What was the last time I streamed high? Hmm. That's a good question. The last time I streamed high
[2002.20s -> 2013.10s]  was I think saw two. It was just, I, that was it. It's not today. No, I told you I,
[2013.10s -> 2020.87s]  people think I'm high every stream and no, man, I can't do it. I can't. People will say, no,
[2020.87s -> 2024.95s]  it was definitely the hitman stream when you were walking around in the cement place and freaking
[2024.95s -> 2035.83s]  out. No, it wasn't. I made that up. So I didn't look like a fucking idiot. All right. Here you go.
[2035.83s -> 2043.10s]  Here you go. During the hitman stream where I was pissed off and talking so much shit about that
[2043.10s -> 2048.63s]  cement level. And everyone's like, dude, I remember reading in the chat, somebody was like, dude,
[2048.63s -> 2054.25s]  this guy, this is so stupid. This is hard to watch. There's no way he's not high. Otherwise
[2054.25s -> 2058.63s]  it's impossible. And I read that it was something I'm kind of paraphrasing it,
[2058.63s -> 2065.46s]  but I read that and I go, well, yeah, okay. I can, I can use that. And I think I actively said,
[2065.46s -> 2069.62s]  man, huh, this is what a bad time to be playing hitman right when the edible kicks in. And
[2069.62s -> 2076.66s]  everyone's like, Oh, yeah, of course. Of course. Of course. That's what happened. And everyone's
[2076.66s -> 2093.67s]  like, see, Oh, yeah, of course. I was stone stone cold sober that whole stream. Do you have any
[2093.67s -> 2102.44s]  kids? No. But now I've used that. I've done that too many times that people really do think I'm
[2102.44s -> 2114.14s]  high every single stream, which is bad because it's not true. What's my favorite soda flavor?
[2114.14s -> 2127.10s]  I think just, just straight up just standard Coca-Cola or a vanilla Coke or I've, you know,
[2127.10s -> 2137.50s]  I've really liked those San San Pellegrino San that right San Pellegrino. They have this blood
[2137.50s -> 2150.94s]  orange San Pellegrino and it's great. How long were you getting zero views on your videos until
[2150.94s -> 2155.46s]  you started getting more views? I actually, I don't, it's been so long. I really don't remember.
[2155.46s -> 2164.36s]  I just, I really don't. I remember TF2 had the big, I would try to get searched for because TF2
[2164.36s -> 2170.06s]  at the time was uploading, not uploading, but they were adding tons of new stuff to TF2.
[2170.06s -> 2175.11s]  And everyone was sort of looking for footage of that stuff. So when anytime, for instance,
[2175.11s -> 2180.94s]  oh, the medic got a new syringe gun that afternoon, the second that that update dropped,
[2180.94s -> 2188.07s]  the second that steam was downloading it. Boom. Okay. Let's go record, get footage of it,
[2188.07s -> 2194.22s]  talk about it, understand what it, what it, what it does and get it up as fast as I could.
[2194.22s -> 2197.67s]  While still having to be a video that I thought was like good because there were a lot of times
[2197.67s -> 2202.97s]  where I didn't do that. And I just kept fucking up the video over and over again. And I just
[2202.97s -> 2207.80s]  watched it back. And I was like, this video sucks. I'll just wait till tomorrow. And I would be,
[2207.80s -> 2220.54s]  I would get it out like a day or two later. Somebody said, have you ever read Animal Farm?
[2220.54s -> 2241.45s]  Wait, like the book Animal Farm? I've seen the cover a bunch of times. No. Have you ever read
[2241.45s -> 2249.29s]  Ender's Game? No, I don't read. I don't, I actually don't read it. I really don't. It's bad, but I
[2249.29s -> 2261.19s]  don't. Most of my reading is the back of cereal boxes to see how much iron is in it. Or it's to
[2261.19s -> 2272.71s]  read an ingredients list to see, does that have high fructose corn syrup in it? The heck. I've
[2272.71s -> 2278.02s]  read, oh, you know what turned me off reading forever? I read the Game of Thrones books and
[2278.02s -> 2283.32s]  I was super into them. And those are like 5 million pages each. And I was obsessed with them. And
[2283.32s -> 2287.00s]  then they just never came out ever again. So I was like, I fucking hate books. I'm never reading a
[2287.00s -> 2310.30s]  book again. What's my personal squat record, bro? I didn't do squats. I love that. That's, this is
[2310.30s -> 2321.69s]  like, this is such a, that's like, that's like the piano of, of the comb sounds, right? Do you guys
[2321.69s -> 2330.38s]  think that, um, the last Game of Thrones books will ever come out? I, I, I don't think they will.
[2330.38s -> 2338.28s]  I really don't. I've accepted at this point that I just don't. I'll, I'm okay. At this point in my
[2338.28s -> 2346.12s]  mind, after, at, at, in the middle of the last chapter of Dance of Dragons, in my brain, there
[2346.12s -> 2352.84s]  was this elaborate shit going on. Crazy story. Oh, Tyrion Lannister and, oh my God, Daenerys.
[2352.84s -> 2359.42s]  All this crazy cool stuff. And in my mind, what I do is I, I go to the middle of the last page of
[2359.50s -> 2366.68s]  that book and I pretend that a meteor hit earth in the middle of one of their sentences in the
[2366.68s -> 2373.91s]  last page. And that's it. And it's like, obviously they can't do any more of this story. A fucking
[2373.91s -> 2383.24s]  meteor hit earth and wiped out all of civilization. That's how I do it. As you had just a comet
[2383.24s -> 2392.81s]  strikes earth and kills everybody. So, wow. I, wow. What if, right? What if, I wonder what would
[2392.81s -> 2403.78s]  happen if that comet didn't strike earth? That's probably a real, that's probably the real ending.
[2403.78s -> 2411.40s]  That'd be funny. That would be so funny. At this point, I feel like he should do that. You know
[2411.40s -> 2423.06s]  what I mean? Does that the end of Winds of Winter or whatever? Does it have a meteor strike? The
[2423.06s -> 2432.09s]  book is, the book is like 60 pages long. I feel like people would forgive him for that. I feel
[2432.09s -> 2447.82s]  like it'd be like, that's actually really funny. That's such a horse shit. Yeah. And you know how
[2447.82s -> 2451.82s]  it's broken up by chapters by name. So for instance, if you don't, if you had never read
[2451.82s -> 2460.10s]  the song of ice and fire books, it's their chapters are broken up into the Tyrion one and then
[2460.10s -> 2465.86s]  Tyrion two comes three or four chapters later, right? Tyrion six. So the chapters are the names
[2465.86s -> 2469.78s]  of the characters and then like what chapter that character is on. So how fucking funny would it be
[2469.78s -> 2476.28s]  if you just turn the page and it was like meteor one and it was what the meteor was up to during
[2476.28s -> 2482.95s]  the, during a feast for crows and you've got meteor two, meteor three, meteor four, and meteor
[2483.03s -> 2488.79s]  four is when it hits. I mean, I don't have to give you all the answers, George, but
[2488.79s -> 2501.35s]  could be one of them. What's the shirt? It's hash house a go-go at the link. Best cheeseburger
[2501.35s -> 2518.86s]  I've ever had in my life. How do you feel? I feel all right. Are you going to Twitch con?
[2518.86s -> 2527.91s]  Probably not. Probably not. Way too much going on around that time period. That probably not.
[2527.91s -> 2539.80s]  We'll see though. I don't know. I don't think so. What Diablo two clash should I choose? Are you
[2539.80s -> 2544.78s]  kind of, are you a kind of person that likes to, you know, do spells or do you like spells and
[2544.78s -> 2549.61s]  summoning or do you like summoning? If you like to summon, I'm telling you the most fun you could
[2549.61s -> 2554.57s]  ever have in any game. No one's ever done it as good. No one's ever done it as good. Summoning in
[2554.57s -> 2561.30s]  all games sucks ass in every single game except for this one. I don't know what, okay, let me go
[2561.30s -> 2568.17s]  off on a little bit of a tangent here. What happened to summoning in video games? Because
[2568.17s -> 2572.78s]  summoning in video games became this, it was this cool thing that you could just summon a shit load
[2572.78s -> 2576.62s]  of things and have like a ton of different kinds of units and almost be like this commander to,
[2577.91s -> 2584.66s]  you get two and they're kind of strong, aren't they? I don't want two summons. I don't want to
[2584.66s -> 2590.26s]  like dump a bunch of points into one summon or like three summons. I want 30 things on the screen.
[2590.26s -> 2599.32s]  Oh man, I'm going to be, oh, there's a summoner in this. Oh shit. I wonder what it's like.
[2599.32s -> 2614.55s]  You get two skeletons or two specters. Isn't that fun? That's StarCraft, idiot. You're an idiot.
[2614.55s -> 2619.56s]  I don't like that game. I didn't like StarCraft. You know why? Because I played it when I was like
[2619.56s -> 2625.32s]  fucking 15 over like a telephone connection with somebody. And they did this thing where I went,
[2625.32s -> 2629.00s]  I was about to beat them. I was about to defeat them, right? I'm going to defeat them. And they
[2629.00s -> 2633.96s]  played this, whatever this character class was, wherever it was, where their building started to
[2633.96s -> 2639.91s]  float off the ground and I couldn't attack them. And I just couldn't do anything. He lowers all
[2639.91s -> 2643.91s]  the buildings and then he attacked me afterwards and I lost the game. So I was like, this game's
[2643.91s -> 2660.52s]  stupid. I'm never playing it ever again. Terran. Yeah, whatever. That was stupid. You got out Terran.
[2660.52s -> 2667.24s]  I was 14 and I, what do you want me to say? Out Terran. I don't have like 10,000 hours in StarCraft.
[2667.24s -> 2672.65s]  I was playing with my friends over a telephone line and I was like, this game's dumb.
[2672.65s -> 2683.22s]  I don't want to play it anymore. You said 15. I don't know. It was when I was younger. Wait,
[2683.22s -> 2686.49s]  talk. Wait, wait, what do you want to do? Can you look off screen when you talk? I don't want to
[2686.49s -> 2695.14s]  make eye contact with you. All right. I'm not, I'm talking, I'm talking like this. I'm talking like
[2695.14s -> 2700.92s]  this. I'm not looking at you. You ever played RuneScape? I never played RuneScape, but I really
[2700.92s -> 2707.59s]  feel like I should have. I feel like I would be a super RuneScape guy if I ever played it back in
[2707.59s -> 2722.28s]  the day. I don't think I could play it now. Can you say big Chungus? I just did. Oh shit. Am I even
[2722.28s -> 2729.74s]  on Twitch right now? Oh boy. Wait, what did I think I was streaming this to? Dude, am I even
[2729.74s -> 2755.80s]  on Twitch right now? No, you're not. Twitter spaces. Do I have any good other tweet, draft
[2755.80s -> 2764.30s]  tweets? Let's find out. Let me see if I have any, any, any good draft tweets. Okay. So,
[2768.44s -> 2772.52s]  all right. This is a pretty good one. So by the way, you guys, here's something you guys need to
[2772.52s -> 2779.66s]  know. Some of you new viewers potentially. I don't use Twitter, but I write a tweet and I put it into
[2779.66s -> 2784.06s]  drafts because I just don't want to post it. So I have like 30, I have like 50 draft tweets.
[2786.74s -> 2793.03s]  I'll read this one. I legit thought every show was filmed in front of a room full of overly
[2793.03s -> 2798.78s]  excited people until I was like 20. Knowing the truth was a Santa Claus 2 situation.
[2808.89s -> 2812.97s]  All right. I got to, I got to tell you this. This was from the 4th of July.
[2814.63s -> 2821.91s]  I was fucking, okay. This tweet is a bat just tried to fucking attack me,
[2822.63s -> 2827.50s]  is the tweet. I just didn't tweet it. I use Twitter drafts as like a journal.
[2828.14s -> 2832.70s]  Okay. So me and Holly, we're walking around. So I just like, Oh, let's go take a walk.
[2832.70s -> 2838.22s]  4th of July, whatever. Let's go take a walk. We just, Oh, well, it's like, Oh, cool. Like people
[2838.22s -> 2843.56s]  are out. Oh, this is interesting. Just taking a walk. We're on the way back, walking around
[2844.20s -> 2851.64s]  and going down around as we're through like the neighborhoods and everything. And we get close to,
[2851.64s -> 2859.85s]  we get close to the place, like my place. And maybe I would say a couple hundred yards away
[2859.85s -> 2870.57s]  from the house, like from my house. And I just saw from right here, it was just this like,
[2870.57s -> 2874.14s]  just floating right here. And I thought it was like a bug or something. So I didn't freak out.
[2874.14s -> 2880.30s]  And there were two other people walking and they noticed that I stopped and they noticed that I was
[2880.30s -> 2885.42s]  being weird because I was just like, what, what is, what's going on? Holly's right here next to me.
[2885.42s -> 2892.22s]  And she goes, she kind of screams and she dodges. And this fucking bat, dude, this huge bat, we're
[2892.22s -> 2899.83s]  talking like Batman type in the fucking silhouette with the light behind it. Huge bat was just like
[2900.39s -> 2904.63s]  flapping its wings, like trying to fucking kill me. It was like, it was about to kill me. It was
[2904.63s -> 2910.68s]  about to like start attacking me. And I was like, I freaked out. I screamed and I moved around. And
[2910.68s -> 2916.15s]  the people over there thought I was afraid of their dog. They were kind of walking with their dogs
[2916.15s -> 2921.88s]  and they thought I was like screaming at the dogs. And I'm like, no, no, did you see the bat?
[2921.88s -> 2926.86s]  I said, did you guys see the bat that flew over? And they're like, no, we didn't. Wow, a bat. And
[2926.86s -> 2931.90s]  I'm like, yeah, a bat. And I had Holly right there too. So I wasn't, I wasn't crazy. So,
[2931.90s -> 2934.62s]  because she was also freaking out too, but they thought, I think they originally thought I was
[2934.62s -> 2943.70s]  scared of the dogs that they had, but it was like, it was, it was crazy. And there are bats around,
[2943.70s -> 2946.82s]  right? And you see them from time to time. You look up and you see them kind of swoop around,
[2947.62s -> 2956.82s]  but never that close. What breed? I don't know what breed the dog was. It was just a nondescript
[2956.82s -> 2963.91s]  dog on a leash. I don't, I didn't, I don't know what breed the dog was. It was just a dog. It was
[2963.91s -> 2972.33s]  two, it was two dogs. They were just dogs. I, it was dark. It was 4th of July. What breed was the
[2972.33s -> 2979.98s]  bat? I don't know. It was big. This is a lie. This is not a lie. I'm, this happened to me
[2979.98s -> 2985.26s]  on the 4th of July. And it's not even that crazy of a story. A bat flew into my face.
[2985.26s -> 2990.22s]  And me and Holly were like, kind of laughing our asses off about it. Cause it's just like,
[2990.22s -> 2996.79s]  can you imagine if I had to cancel a stream? Like the reasoning. Oh, hey, sorry guys. I got
[2996.79s -> 3003.59s]  to cancel the stream. I got attacked by a bat. I got bit by a bat. I have to, I can't stream
[3003.59s -> 3013.77s]  tomorrow. What are your thoughts on the tectonic plates? I mean, I think we should stop fucking
[3013.77s -> 3028.46s]  with them. Vampire Andy. Jerma, I've spent so many points. I need an answer. Oh, it just got
[3028.46s -> 3041.48s]  deleted. It's gone. I don't know what it was. It was something about, have you ever eaten a bag of
[3041.48s -> 3044.84s]  warheads in one sitting? And the answer is no, because that's fucked up. Don't do that. That's
[3044.84s -> 3063.91s]  weird. I can't stream. There's a bee here. Are you going to release new shirts? You too, shirt Andy.
[3063.91s -> 3071.82s]  Yeah. All right. Well, I, but it's a surprise if it goes through. Yes. This things, this merchandise
[3071.82s -> 3076.46s]  that I've like, oh, that would be kind of fun. There's a lot of merchandise coming, a lot of
[3076.46s -> 3083.42s]  merchandise wearables, but it's cool. And I want to announce it when I, when I want to announce it
[3083.42s -> 3088.31s]  and it's going to be cool. You could probably guess what it is. If you could just, if you wanted to
[3088.31s -> 3097.72s]  guess of what merchandise could be coming in the next 30 to 45 days, what is happening in the next
[3097.72s -> 3102.44s]  30 to 45 days on this channel? What could possibly be tied in with that? What could you possibly tie
[3102.44s -> 3110.66s]  in with that? You know what I mean, Vern? I can't fucking hide and drink. I hate drinking on camera.
[3110.66s -> 3126.42s]  I always feel like nobody looks good drinking on camera. Nobody. Is it a bat shirt? It's just like
[3126.42s -> 3139.80s]  a big flapping bat. But that story is not even that big. It's not even like a crazy story.
[3140.52s -> 3153.96s]  I just forgot about it because I had a tweet that I didn't tweet. Why do you have the 2016
[3153.96s -> 3161.54s]  before Vegas camera? Make the, that one's gotten too. Mods are on point today. Mods are on point
[3161.54s -> 3176.39s]  today. Do you like hamsters or guinea pigs? Are they both cute and fun and interesting and fun?
[3176.39s -> 3182.47s]  I don't know. They're both, both of them are fine. I haven't combed in a while. You're right. Let's
[3182.47s -> 3199.93s]  fix that right now. This is too long. This is, this is like a little too long. I'll grow into it.
[3201.94s -> 3207.62s]  I'll grow into it. It's just a little too long. Once these come out a little and this comes down
[3207.62s -> 3230.55s]  a little, it'll look a lot better. Who's your favorite chat member? All of you. Nope. That's
[3230.55s -> 3246.12s]  a joke. Some of you guys are dicks. Would you ever be an actor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?
[3250.18s -> 3261.10s]  I don't know. At this point, who would I even be? They've, they've like made every movie.
[3261.10s -> 3280.42s]  Well, who would I even be? The Joker. That's a different universe. You should be in a movie.
[3280.42s -> 3292.57s]  We make our own movies here. You still was, I didn't say it.
[3294.20s -> 3301.32s]  Oh, you could be young Green Goblin. I could be old. I could be regular Green Goblin. I'm 36.
[3302.38s -> 3308.54s]  I might look, you know what I mean? I think a lot. I might look a little younger, but I'm 40 in,
[3308.54s -> 3318.66s]  I've got to be regular. Why don't I be young Green Goblin? Young Green Goblin. How old was
[3318.66s -> 3335.86s]  Willem Dafoe in this first Spider-Man movie? 40 something. You don't look old. I don't want to,
[3335.86s -> 3345.91s]  I don't want to be young Green Goblin. Moisturized Green Goblin. He was 45. Okay.
[3345.91s -> 3358.33s]  So in 10 years, we'll talk. How come you look like so many different celebrities? I don't know.
[3358.33s -> 3369.50s]  I'm, what do you want me to say? I have brown hair. I have a, I'm default face Andy. I mean,
[3369.50s -> 3381.69s]  I'm just brown hair white guy. I mean, there's, what do you want me to say? I default face.
[3387.42s -> 3399.61s]  Give us a profile. Okay. My profiles are a little different because my nose is crooked.
[3399.61s -> 3405.32s]  So like, for instance, like this, ready? This is a little, and my hair is parted this way too.
[3405.32s -> 3412.02s]  So my nose goes this way. So my nose is more pronounced over here with my nostril because
[3412.02s -> 3416.98s]  my nose is crooked and my mouth is like upside down. I don't know. A lot of people don't,
[3416.98s -> 3425.27s]  don't know that about me, but take a look at my mouth. Half of my mouth is like normal. And then
[3425.27s -> 3433.82s]  the other half is like Joker mouth. Like I have like half Joker mouth. See what I mean? Like it
[3433.90s -> 3438.76s]  goes like kind of down and this way, but here it's, it's kind of flat. So I have like my lip
[3438.76s -> 3444.42s]  kind of goes down like that and my nose goes this way. So that's why I look a little different from
[3444.42s -> 3448.82s]  this angle because I've got kind of like the Joker mouth here and the nose going this way.
[3448.82s -> 3454.71s]  Whereas over here, it's a little less pronounced on the Joker mouth and the nose is going that
[3454.71s -> 3458.79s]  way. So my, and the eye is a little set a little differently because this one's set a little deeper
[3458.79s -> 3470.09s]  from head on. I mean, it's fine, but once you get an angle here, you kind of see the different
[3471.02s -> 3487.96s]  roads. My face has kind of like two-face guy kind of. Yeah. Cause my lip line goes like this
[3488.78s -> 3496.46s]  instead of like on this side, it goes like this. It's just like the way my lip goes.
[3496.46s -> 3516.36s]  And then this line goes a little bit further like that. So if I go like this, ready, I'm sure I,
[3516.36s -> 3529.13s]  whatever, I'm trying to move the nose and get rid of the lip line. You'd, you'd be a good rat man
[3529.13s -> 3541.08s]  instead of a Batman. I don't, I would want to, I would not want to be Batman. Have you seen the
[3541.08s -> 3552.94s]  new Minion movie? By the way, I have a question about the new Minion movie. Why do they keep
[3552.94s -> 3564.04s]  putting Gru in these movies? Minions, rise of Gru. Minions, Gru's in it as well. No, the kids
[3564.04s -> 3572.15s]  don't give a shit about Gru. Why do they have to keep tying it to Gru? The Minions is what
[3572.15s -> 3578.44s]  everybody cares about. Why not just, why does he have to be in the movie? Why can't it be like
[3578.44s -> 3585.90s]  the Minions? Uh, like the Minion, the great Minion caper, right? The great Muppet caper,
[3586.06s -> 3591.80s]  like they can't just have their own movie. He's the main character, not in the Minion movies.
[3591.80s -> 3604.28s]  This is the Minions movie. Minions. They already did that. There's a way there's already a Minions
[3604.28s -> 3619.00s]  movie with just the Minions movie. What was it? What did they do? Minions, the rise of Gru,
[3619.00s -> 3626.57s]  Minions film. Okay. Minions is a 2015 American computer animated comedy film produced by
[3626.57s -> 3635.82s]  illumination. Oh, there is a, this is a long time ago. The rise of Gru is Minions too. So wait,
[3635.82s -> 3640.54s]  did the Minions, they could, they couldn't hang on their own? So they needed Gru to come back
[3640.54s -> 3657.38s]  him up? What did people think about the first one? It sucked. Did it really? Oh shit, it has bad,
[3657.38s -> 3672.89s]  it doesn't have great reviews. No, you're right. Imagine not being invested in Minions lore. Hold
[3672.89s -> 3682.49s]  on. What, what did it actually have for ratings? Minions movie, like Rotten Tomatoes. I want to,
[3682.49s -> 3696.09s]  ooh, this is really, what was wrong with it? Okay. Let's, let's read it. Okay. I got tired
[3696.09s -> 3700.25s]  of this joke before the movie ended, but I appreciate the gusto with which the filmmakers,
[3700.25s -> 3710.38s]  particularly Coffin with his nimble vocalizations carried it out. Okay. Fittingly, because they're
[3710.38s -> 3717.18s]  pill shaped, the Minions work best in small doses. That's a line. That's why, that's why,
[3717.18s -> 3730.22s]  that's why they're a top critic. Top critic. What a fucking line. Seeing the Minions end up in your
[3730.22s -> 3737.80s]  happy meal would not have been a stretch in this absurd, tangential movie. Actually, it would have
[3737.80s -> 3746.41s]  been more to the point. Holy shit. These critics have some real bangers. This, these are fucking
[3746.41s -> 3768.41s]  great. Okay. Okay. Let's start with what Minions gets right. It's a mercifully short 93 minutes
[3768.41s -> 3779.42s]  long, but even at that length, it still feels padded. Merciful. It's, I just imagine this guy
[3779.42s -> 3791.78s]  sitting there just like fucking fidgeting in the chair, like, ah, it's like, you know, the last
[3791.78s -> 3797.16s]  40 minutes on an airplane when it's like a four or five hour airplane and you've made it all the
[3797.16s -> 3800.52s]  way through, but you only got like another 30 minutes left and you're just like, fucking get
[3800.52s -> 3811.40s]  me the fuck out of this chair. And then you hear like, we are now doing our final descent in Las
[3811.40s -> 3818.28s]  Vegas, whatever. And you're just like, thank God. But that last 30 minutes takes four hours. That's
[3818.28s -> 3832.70s]  how this guy felt watching the Minion movie. Calm down, dude. It's just a cartoon. Like right before,
[3832.70s -> 3836.70s]  okay, on an airplane, right before it's like time to, you got to sit down for the, you have to,
[3836.70s -> 3842.98s]  you have to be seated for that 40 straight minutes to an hour during the descent, right? So I know
[3842.98s -> 3846.98s]  that's coming. So she's like, all right, but right before we do the final descent, I try to time it
[3846.98s -> 3850.42s]  so I can just like get up, go to the bathroom, even if I don't have to piss or anything,
[3850.42s -> 3862.89s]  and just like, just like fucking get me out of here. And just like look in the mirror and like
[3862.89s -> 3869.69s]  wash my hands. Okay, fine. Okay, I'm good. And then sit down. And I'm ready for the hour that you
[3869.69s -> 3878.47s]  can't move. No, I'm not talking, I'm not, I'm just talking about, I'm not like going into the fucking,
[3879.51s -> 3883.99s]  the bathroom in the airplane and like making a bunch of weird sounds and stuff. I'm just saying
[3883.99s -> 3889.02s]  like you move around, you kind of crack your knuckles. I can't, I hate sitting there for an
[3889.02s -> 3894.89s]  hour. I would never ever, and this is why people are like, oh, hey man, you ever gonna go to like
[3894.89s -> 3901.21s]  Europe for anything? No, I could never do it. I can never do people, oh yeah, man, it's not bad.
[3901.21s -> 3916.01s]  Yeah, the flight to London's not bad. It's like 11 hours. Huh? No, no, no, no. I keep, I hear about
[3916.01s -> 3922.41s]  people that take these long trips across the whole world. Well, yeah, it's 12 hours. And then you get
[3922.41s -> 3929.45s]  off at, you know, whatever in, in like France. And then after an hour, you lay over for an hour,
[3929.45s -> 3936.94s]  you get another 14 hour plane. I think, no, I'll do, can I do it through Zoom? Just sleep,
[3936.94s -> 3945.96s]  I can't sleep on airplanes. It's, it's, I just can't do it. I've tried, I just can't do it.
[3945.96s -> 3949.24s]  One of the number one reasons I cannot sleep on an airplane is nothing to do with like being
[3949.24s -> 3954.95s]  able to actually, you know, drift off and go to bed. It's, I don't know what I look like sleeping
[3954.95s -> 3962.52s]  on an airplane. It freaks me out. Cause I, cause people walk up and down that aisle and I just know
[3962.52s -> 3969.10s]  that, you know, if I'm sitting there like, it's just like people are walking by going like, oh,
[3969.10s -> 3974.54s]  that guy's sleeping. Like, no, don't, I don't want, I don't want to, like, I always have a hat.
[3974.54s -> 3980.50s]  So I go like, put the hat down like this, but then you're like, and then it's like, okay,
[3981.46s -> 3995.46s]  put a mask on. You're such a diva. You know, I remember one time you want to diva moment.
[3995.46s -> 4000.71s]  I remember one time, you know, this movie's on airplanes. It's like, okay, it's going to be,
[4001.27s -> 4007.94s]  so for instance, I'll give you a perfect example. Bohemian Rhapsody, the movie. It's like, oh, hey,
[4007.94s -> 4013.22s]  by the way, there's movies on your TV in front of you. Right. So, and everyone goes, oh, okay.
[4013.22s -> 4016.90s]  Am I going to watch the movie or what is on long planes, by the way, at least like three, four or
[4016.90s -> 4022.82s]  five hours. So there was, there was one time when I was taking a plane and I loaded up Bohemian
[4022.82s -> 4028.15s]  Rhapsody. I was like, all right, Bohemian Rhapsody, let's go. I want to watch Bohemian Rhapsody.
[4028.15s -> 4036.06s]  And I, maybe I didn't start it fast enough, but there was a guy over there who also was watching
[4036.06s -> 4043.19s]  Bohemian Rhapsody and I was in the aisle and he was in the aisle. And out of the corner of my eye,
[4043.19s -> 4052.39s]  he was 10 seconds in front of me in the movie. And I'm just sitting there being like,
[4052.39s -> 4062.15s]  shit, I could see this. There's a stream delay. I'm getting the stream delay version. So I just
[4062.15s -> 4067.66s]  sat there and I was like, I can't watch this movie because I'm literally, I literally am seeing this.
[4067.66s -> 4071.58s]  I have this in like my peripheral, like right there. Somebody else is watching the exact same
[4071.58s -> 4075.58s]  fucking movie 10 seconds in front of me. So I contemplate, I didn't do this, but I contemplated,
[4075.58s -> 4085.43s]  I contemplated walking up to him and saying, Steve from Davidson high school. So he had
[4085.43s -> 4090.97s]  to pause his movie. And so he'd be like, oh no, I'd be like, oh shit, sorry about that.
[4090.97s -> 4095.88s]  So they're like, all right, I'll get back to my seat so I can watch the fucking movie now.
[4095.88s -> 4104.47s]  I didn't do it. I just didn't watch. But you know what I mean? Like the thought for one second was
[4104.47s -> 4111.19s]  like, I was going to wait for him to go to the bathroom. Like, okay, when he go, I can like,
[4111.19s -> 4121.08s]  can I catch, is he going to pause the movie? Fast forward. You can't fast forward. You're such a
[4121.08s -> 4125.32s]  bad liar. This is a real story. Like I'm not, why would I, what a dumb thing to make up. This is a
[4125.32s -> 4131.54s]  stupid thing to make up. This is a dumb thing to make up. I didn't do it. I didn't do that. I
[4131.54s -> 4136.98s]  thought about it. Like, is there like, how do I like, because I'm not, I can't get over that.
[4136.98s -> 4150.07s]  It's right there. ADHD makes you a genius in the wrong ways, but you would have to have paused your
[4150.07s -> 4158.23s]  movie as well. So that's why I said, all right, fuck it. I can't, I'm not going to watch this
[4158.23s -> 4160.95s]  movie and I'm not going to bother somebody because that's like, I don't want to do that.
[4160.95s -> 4164.31s]  That's stupid. I wouldn't want somebody to bother me. Like you're just trying to relax on a plane.
[4164.31s -> 4168.47s]  Like I'm not going to do that. So I just like, try to go to bed and whatever. But now if I want
[4168.47s -> 4174.95s]  to watch a movie, if I ever want to watch a fucking movie ever, it's like, oh, and the movies are on,
[4175.75s -> 4179.27s]  what is it? Stuart Little, Stuart Little, go, go, go, Stuart Little. I'm watching Stuart Little
[4179.27s -> 4184.57s]  first. Fuck off. I got it first. I'm watching Stuart Little. So, and then I just go and turn
[4184.57s -> 4195.91s]  it on as soon as it's possible. So then imagine like, so I get Stuart Little on, right? Stuart
[4195.91s -> 4200.57s]  Little is on. I got somebody right next to me, right? And playing and whatever. And I'm five to
[4200.57s -> 4212.38s]  ten minutes into Stuart Little and I feel, hey, yeah. Oh, I paused the movie. John? John from,
[4212.38s -> 4223.99s]  from, from Davidson Academy? I know this trick motherfucker. And I'm just going to hit play.
[4223.99s -> 4238.90s]  Oh, play. No, sorry. Enjoy the movie. Nice standup routine. This is a comb stream.
[4240.02s -> 4245.96s]  All the new viewers don't understand what this is. It's for me to give you all my failed material.
[4246.60s -> 4261.05s]  Who is your favorite minion? Definitely the one that wears overalls. You know what they should do?
[4261.13s -> 4269.21s]  Then they used to do this, didn't they? They used to do this. Wasn't it? The movies just started.
[4269.21s -> 4284.73s]  And if you, they just played at the same time for everybody, right? It used to be like that.
[4284.73s -> 4291.78s]  They all did. Yeah. All of them started at the same time. They would even announce it. They'd go,
[4291.78s -> 4296.90s]  by the way, if you want to watch Stuart Little, it's currently on channel four, whatever. And it's
[4296.90s -> 4300.74s]  currently about to start. And it's like, okay, I'm going to, there's Stuart Little right there.
[4303.80s -> 4313.96s]  You're a minion centrist. Don't stop talking about Stuart Little.
[4313.96s -> 4329.37s]  Well, you don't like that movie. You didn't like Stuart Little. No, you didn't. Dr. House
[4329.37s -> 4335.93s]  is in that movie and he's great in it. By the way, Dr. House is a great show if you haven't seen it.
[4335.93s -> 4349.64s]  Um, what's wrong with you? Who would win in a fight? Ratatouille or Stuart Little? Stuart Little
[4349.64s -> 4362.39s]  would run him over with the car. Do Toontown now. Would you survive the zombie apocalypse?
[4362.39s -> 4365.83s]  Anybody that says with complete and total certainty that they would survive the zombie
[4365.83s -> 4377.64s]  apocalypse would not survive the zombie apocalypse. I'd be scrappy. I don't know
[4377.64s -> 4383.32s]  if I would do it though. I would try. Where would you go in a zombie apocalypse? I mean,
[4384.63s -> 4395.58s]  the easiest answer is the grocery store, right? But that's what everyone's going to do.
[4395.58s -> 4400.97s]  Oh, I know what I would do. I would go to the newest showing of the minions movie because no
[4400.97s -> 4414.87s]  one was going to be there. Ow. I'm just kidding guys. I don't know. I'm too old to care about the
[4414.87s -> 4422.17s]  minions. Once the minions replaced Shrek at Universal Studios, that's how I knew I was too
[4422.17s -> 4429.82s]  old. That's how I knew I was too old for anything. I don't even know if that's accurate. I just said
[4429.82s -> 4438.97s]  it. No, you know how I know I'm too old for anything? When I found out that because at
[4438.97s -> 4445.45s]  Universal Studios, it was at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios Florida, right? When I found
[4445.45s -> 4453.35s]  out that there was no more Nickelodeon Studios anymore, that all there is at Universal Studios
[4453.35s -> 4461.29s]  that's Nickelodeon related is a store with SpongeBob on it. I'm just like, what happened?
[4465.10s -> 4476.92s]  What happened? There's a merchandise booth for Nickelodeon. There's no, where are the rides?
[4476.92s -> 4484.25s]  Where's Nickelodeon Studios? Nickelodeon fell off. Yeah, but still, I mean,
[4487.08s -> 4491.02s]  you know, SpongeBob is, everyone still loves SpongeBob. Don't kids still love SpongeBob?
[4491.02s -> 4514.22s]  They still do, right? Yeah. Why am I encouraging it? I don't know. Have you ever done psychedelics
[4514.22s -> 4526.71s]  before? No. No, I don't. I never want to. I'm not into that at all. I'm really not. Why not?
[4526.71s -> 4534.81s]  I mean, there's a few reasons why. I think like alcohol and marijuana, they affect you in a way
[4534.81s -> 4543.93s]  that you still kind of have like control and an agency, right? I'm not into the kind of loss
[4543.93s -> 4562.06s]  of agency, the loss of kind of control. I don't like that. So no, I would never do it. I know that
[4562.06s -> 4567.91s]  like I've heard that you can, there's lower doses, right? But I don't think so. I'm not into it at
[4567.91s -> 4589.94s]  all. Not at all. He's a control freak. Yeah, I don't, I, no, I can't. But yeah, I mean,
[4590.66s -> 4597.10s]  I also don't want to encourage people to do something like that because I honestly,
[4597.10s -> 4602.54s]  I have no experience with it. So I would never ever want to tell anybody on this stream. Oh man.
[4603.18s -> 4609.45s]  Yeah, dude, go for it. No, right? Like that's, that's not something I'm ever going to ever talk
[4609.45s -> 4618.90s]  about because I don't do it and I don't ever want to do it. So that's the way it is. What do I think
[4618.90s -> 4629.48s]  of Ludwig's recent show? I thought it was unbelievable. Is it true that you drink a shot of vodka before
[4629.48s -> 4632.76s]  big streams? Ludwig leaked it today on his stream because he did it before Mogul Money and called
[4632.76s -> 4643.91s]  it the German method. Yeah, usually. Yeah. What it does is it, everybody kind of gets together and we
[4643.91s -> 4656.09s]  do a big toast and it's a good way to kind of, you get everybody together. New lore. I mean,
[4656.09s -> 4666.65s]  people aren't fucking throwing back like booze the whole time. It's a toast. It's a toast. It's not a
[4666.65s -> 4672.58s]  everybody catch together, let's get fucked up. It's, it's a toast. And it's a way to get everybody
[4672.58s -> 4678.06s]  together and say, let's have a good show. And usually whether it's me or Jake or whatever,
[4678.06s -> 4684.50s]  we thank everybody for being there, especially the crew. And I don't know, I feel like it's a
[4684.50s -> 4689.58s]  nice fun way to make a, and it's never required or anything, right? It's one of those things where
[4689.58s -> 4694.97s]  you can do it if you want to, if you're obviously old enough, right? And if not, then that's all
[4694.97s -> 4702.39s]  good. But I like doing stuff like that because to the person like behind the camera, to the person
[4702.39s -> 4707.75s]  like at the audio deck, to the person like in front of the camera, doing a toast, that's like a
[4707.99s -> 4713.21s]  let's get it. Let's do it. Let's go for it is a really nice fun way to do it. Toast to health
[4713.21s -> 4718.04s]  and wealth. Yeah. Oh yeah. Usually Jake will say a few words. I'll say a few words and we just like,
[4718.04s -> 4726.60s]  let's go for it. Mogul Money Live was unbelievable. Ludwig should be incredibly fucking proud of
[4726.60s -> 4734.98s]  himself and everybody that was on that show is a great show. I said this before. I said this before
[4734.98s -> 4744.65s]  Ludwig has it. If you're looking for it, you look carbonated, turn the full cam off. I'm trying to
[4744.65s -> 4753.30s]  be real. No, it was, it was a really, it was a really awesome thing to watch. I laughed out loud
[4753.30s -> 4772.14s]  at least a dozen times. This is Jeremy today, not Jerma. Kind of the same, but not really,
[4772.14s -> 4780.81s]  maybe a little different. You look carbonated. Is that your bed on the floor behind you? That's
[4780.81s -> 4803.10s]  the bed that Otto doesn't sleep in. Are you green screened in? No, I'm not. But yeah. No, I,
[4804.46s -> 4812.57s]  let's talk about shows too. I love that shit more than anything. Doing the big stuff is just,
[4812.57s -> 4816.41s]  I love every second of it. I love being there. I love talking to everybody there. I love,
[4816.49s -> 4823.34s]  I love getting in it, into it big time, right? That's what the focus is. That's what the focus
[4823.34s -> 4832.57s]  is for the foreseeable future. If I can, you look like a cardboard cutout. What would, what would
[4832.57s -> 4845.75s]  my cardboard cutout even look like? They all look kind of odd and uncanny, right? And their hands
[4845.75s -> 4852.62s]  are always way too small. It's like this, right? It's always like their arms and there's a weird
[4852.62s -> 4866.82s]  perspective problem. So this is 2D plane and it's like this. Do a cigar tier list. I don't smoke
[4866.82s -> 4880.94s]  cigars. The dollhouse was incredible, but that's the thing. I've, I've, I told you guys about the
[4880.94s -> 4885.21s]  stress of doing stuff behind the scenes with this baseball show, and I won't go into that much
[4885.21s -> 4896.50s]  detail, but trying to do these things is very hard sometimes. And it's like just, it, it annoys me
[4896.50s -> 4905.27s]  that it is, right? And I'm at the point right now where I'm doing everything possible to make sure
[4905.27s -> 4912.63s]  that I can do some of these big things that I want to do. And how do you do that? Do you
[4914.41s -> 4918.97s]  get sponsors? Do you have like maybe one of the platforms will, will do it, right? Or,
[4919.13s -> 4930.18s]  reach out or whatever, but nothing's ever guaranteed. And I'm starting to realize that
[4930.18s -> 4937.48s]  fact right now that it's not just like, oh yeah, dollhouse was really cool. Let's do another one.
[4937.48s -> 4940.92s]  Oh yeah, let's do another one right now. Let's go right now. Let's go for it. Well, how much is
[4940.92s -> 4951.21s]  it going to cost? A lot, a lot. Okay. Does anybody want to pay for it? Maybe even if we reach out,
[4951.21s -> 4958.74s]  whatever. And we've, for baseball, there are sponsors we've been talking to, but it's actually
[4958.74s -> 4965.64s]  kind of a lot harder than I anticipated. It's been too long since the last co-op stream. Yeah,
[4965.64s -> 4973.46s]  it has. It has. Don't do it then. Just play shitty 2000s video games. I would quit if that's what I
[4973.46s -> 4983.83s]  was just doing every day. I have to be, I'm going to be honest with you. I have to. It's these big
[4983.83s -> 4993.53s]  shows that keep me around. I have to be real. And I always said this, I never want to force myself
[4993.53s -> 4997.13s]  to do something or I never want to do something just to do it. Which is another reason why you've
[4997.13s -> 5007.82s]  seen, I mean, stream two or three times a week, maybe less than that. Cause I can't do that. It's
[5007.82s -> 5013.21s]  unfair to me. It's unfair to you and anybody else that had anything to do with any of the projects
[5013.21s -> 5024.41s]  or anything. What's the worst comb you've ever had? A comb is just teeth spread out very finely.
[5024.41s -> 5038.26s]  It's not, this is, this is, this is, this is, this is all there is. Now that was a cardboard cutout
[5038.26s -> 5064.23s]  here. This lice in your hair. Now what? Now what? Uh, what were we saying? If you had a hundred
[5064.23s -> 5073.40s]  thousand dollars, what would you use it for? The baseball show. There it is. Or other stuff too.
[5073.48s -> 5079.02s]  There's so many things I want to do. I have, I just, this, I, what, what am I even going to
[5079.02s -> 5085.61s]  say about it? But just know that I've been desperately trying to do shit behind the scenes
[5085.61s -> 5090.09s]  and trying to make sure I can cover it, make sure I can do it, make sure I can pay for it.
[5090.09s -> 5105.50s]  He's desperately trying to shit. You should host a fundraising night. That's a pre mini event that
[5105.50s -> 5111.67s]  I don't want you guys to pay for that. That's the whole point. I don't want people to mention,
[5111.67s -> 5115.58s]  maybe you're dude getting the crowdfunding and stuff. No, I don't want to do that.
[5115.58s -> 5120.86s]  I don't want to do that because I don't want you guys to pay for it. This channel over the
[5120.86s -> 5128.25s]  last 10 plus years, I have not done very many sponsors and you guys have, I've had so much
[5128.25s -> 5133.38s]  money has come into this channel already that I really don't want to fucking do that. I don't
[5133.38s -> 5140.87s]  want to be one of those people that's like, Oh yeah, I mean fucking thousands of subs a month.
[5140.87s -> 5145.51s]  Hey, uh, yo, um, people that have already, you know, been paying me a shitload of money every
[5145.51s -> 5149.67s]  month. Hey dude, I want to do this project. I need like fucking 200 K let's make it happen.
[5149.67s -> 5156.31s]  Community let's go. No, fuck that. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that.
[5156.31s -> 5166.44s]  I really don't want to do that. Um, because I already, there's already subs on the channel,
[5166.44s -> 5172.14s]  right? I don't, it's, that doesn't, I don't like it. I don't want to do it.
[5172.14s -> 5179.94s]  I would rather have a company come in, be able to cover the whole thing and that's it. And let's go
[5179.94s -> 5187.02s]  and a lot of the, look, the companies that come in and help, obviously my brain goes, all right,
[5187.02s -> 5190.14s]  what do I want to do? What do I want to show? What can I showcase? What, what, what, what
[5190.14s -> 5196.90s]  sponsors do I want? And a lot of times I have to kind of think about, okay, does the show being
[5196.90s -> 5205.18s]  paid for? And that looks good. We have the money. Okay. Who is the sponsor? Who is it? And trying
[5205.18s -> 5214.84s]  to find the right sponsor and the right time. And it, it's, it's, it's a lot harder than I thought,
[5214.84s -> 5225.91s]  but no, I don't want my viewers to pay for these two, $300,000 plus projects that the whole point
[5225.91s -> 5240.20s]  was I didn't want to have to write the checks myself. So I wouldn't go broke, right? Cause of
[5240.20s -> 5245.34s]  course I, I'm, I can't, what, am I going to sit here and pretend that I don't make a lot of money
[5245.34s -> 5255.54s]  doing this? I would be full of shit. I'd be full of shit. So, but on the other hand of that,
[5255.54s -> 5259.70s]  all the money that comes into the, to the, to these channels, right? I have the YouTube channel
[5259.70s -> 5265.85s]  that has ads on it. I have this Twitch channel, right? That has subscriptions, but if I were just
[5265.85s -> 5272.42s]  to pay for the show myself, all of these shows, they'd be gone. It just would. And I don't want
[5272.42s -> 5277.85s]  to do that either. I want to also obviously protect myself too. Cause yeah, could I write
[5277.85s -> 5285.56s]  a check to cover a $200,000 show? Yeah, but it would be fucking horrible. It would be painful.
[5285.56s -> 5292.33s]  I would be, I would lose a lot of my money. It'd be like, it would, it'd be, it'd be bad.
[5292.33s -> 5299.54s]  And I'm just trying to be realistic with you guys. You could with a bunch of question marks.
[5300.65s -> 5308.71s]  No, I mean, I could, if I physically had to, I could move a bunch of fucking money around
[5308.71s -> 5322.41s]  and do it. And I did that before. I did it before. I don't want to do it again. Show ass
[5322.41s -> 5328.70s]  resident sleeper. All right, that guy will do it. German rumble. Oh yeah. German rumble live.
[5328.70s -> 5333.11s]  For those of you that don't know, I've told the story a few times. We're going to TLDR.
[5333.11s -> 5343.74s]  I, that German rumble live action on the YouTube channel was about $10,000. It was a micro budget,
[5343.74s -> 5351.10s]  tons of stuff. We cut so many corners. And at the time I had like, I had like, I think I only had
[5351.10s -> 5358.95s]  like $1,500 to my name, like available. I liquidated my entire savings account. I had a 401k. I wiped
[5358.95s -> 5366.15s]  out the whole thing so I could make sure to cover the show and pay bills and stuff. It was worth it
[5366.15s -> 5380.66s]  at the end of the day. 10k is a micro budget. Yep, it is. That was kind of stupid. It was,
[5380.66s -> 5395.26s]  but the show happened and it was a great time. And I thought, I thought it was worth it. That's it.
[5395.26s -> 5402.01s]  It was worth it. Did you recoup the costs? I mean, you could probably make the argument that over
[5402.01s -> 5408.31s]  the long term, probably. Yeah. That video did really well. I didn't recoup the costs on the
[5408.31s -> 5414.89s]  video. Cause I mean, ad revenue is not at that point. That was like 2015, 2016. I maybe made
[5414.89s -> 5423.19s]  back maybe 20, 30, maybe 20% from the video. I learned a lot, right? Like somebody said,
[5423.19s -> 5427.03s]  and a lot of people found that video and like the whole wrestling thing. And it just, a lot of people
[5427.03s -> 5442.14s]  came to the channel and stuff. So, but that's, that's it, man. Every stream he loses 1.5,
[5442.14s -> 5451.37s]  $1.6 million. But I have to be realistic. I don't like, if I want to do two or three shows
[5451.37s -> 5455.86s]  this year, right. And each one of those shows is going to cost somewhere between like, you know,
[5455.86s -> 5460.20s]  if you think about like just cost of some of these pretty big projects, somewhere, somewhere
[5460.20s -> 5464.44s]  up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, it'll be gone. All of my money will be gone.
[5464.44s -> 5470.49s]  And it's like, at that point, it's not worth it at that point, because seven years ago, when I was
[5471.05s -> 5478.58s]  still, you know, a YouTuber, I, you know, knew I had like 10 plus potential years in front of me.
[5478.58s -> 5484.65s]  I don't know if I have that right now. I don't know if I have 10 plus more years of this in
[5484.65s -> 5492.60s]  front of me. I don't know. I'm not certain of it, but I'm also not sure of it either. So right,
[5492.60s -> 5505.21s]  like almost seven or eight years ago, I knew I had the time. I don't know if I have 10 years.
[5505.21s -> 5510.33s]  No, we're not talking about retiring. Stop. I'm just saying 10 years is a long fucking time.
[5510.33s -> 5515.29s]  He's not going to be streaming in 2033, because I don't even know what's going to happen in the
[5515.29s -> 5520.09s]  next two years. I don't know what, three years, four years, five, I don't know. I have no idea.
[5520.09s -> 5527.34s]  Who's going to replace you? We already did that. But yeah, forget about, get that out of your head
[5527.34s -> 5539.94s]  right now. We're not talking about that. The goal was always, I try to get the shows paid for,
[5540.58s -> 5545.19s]  not have to, because I don't want somebody, and this is another one of the reasons why
[5545.19s -> 5556.14s]  I pivoted away from, you know, talking about subs and bits and stuff. I just want to make sure that
[5556.14s -> 5560.78s]  these things can happen and nobody has to front the bill for it, especially with the kind of money
[5560.78s -> 5566.84s]  that I fucking make, right? I just got to protect the future and make sure I don't go broke right
[5566.84s -> 5573.50s]  now. Why is your face so red? Because I just rubbed my eye sockets. You're making my girlfriend
[5573.50s -> 5580.89s]  cry. What? What did I do? I didn't do anything. Hey, think about baseball coming up here.
[5580.89s -> 5591.11s]  Baseball stream. The German Baseball Association. Hope you can find a way to make it work. Yeah,
[5591.11s -> 5600.20s]  I think we have some solutions. I think it's going to be fine. There's no cringe in baseball.
[5600.20s -> 5617.26s]  Is it crying? Okay. Can you please smoke cigarettes on stream? What's your worst case scenario?
[5619.14s -> 5629.83s]  There is none. There is none. I mean, worst case scenario is, I mean, some, I don't know. I don't
[5629.83s -> 5637.29s]  want to think of a worst case scenario. Stop reading smoking messages every stream. You know,
[5637.29s -> 5646.87s]  that's true. But this whole thing went off because, you know, why just, just don't even do them. Just
[5646.87s -> 5653.02s]  hang out and play games and stuff. And I don't want to tell you guys this is not true. It's not that
[5653.02s -> 5665.66s]  I'm over that kind of content. It's that I much prefer the other content. I'm much preferred.
[5665.66s -> 5672.71s]  If you guys go back to one of the Spider-Man update videos from like 2014 or 2015, I talked
[5672.71s -> 5677.51s]  about how much I wanted to do big projects. It was something I really cared about. And
[5678.07s -> 5681.11s]  if I ever had the opportunity, it was when I was going to really pay attention to and really care
[5681.11s -> 5689.05s]  about. Here we are now. Like, this is what I care about. Is this a meatball? No, that's a pancake.
[5689.05s -> 5697.06s]  Hash house a go-go at the link in Las Vegas, Nevada. One of the best restaurants I've ever been to.
[5697.06s -> 5701.62s]  Got the best cheeseburger, best cheeseburger in Vegas without a doubt, without a single doubt
[5701.62s -> 5713.05s]  in my mind. Nobody paid me to say this. It's just true. You look like a tourist. Why? Because I have
[5713.05s -> 5731.75s]  a t-shirt on from a restaurant? If you ever were to retire, would you announce it and quietly stop
[5731.75s -> 5741.82s]  or would you make one final bye-bye? What you can probably expect. Here's what you can expect.
[5741.82s -> 5746.78s]  Whenever this is. It's not tomorrow. It's not tomorrow. It's not tomorrow. It's not tomorrow.
[5746.78s -> 5750.70s]  This is not happening tomorrow. This is not tomorrow. This is not next week. This is not
[5750.70s -> 5757.74s]  even potentially next year. I don't know. But what you can expect. This is not tomorrow. I will
[5757.74s -> 5762.94s]  probably announce that I'm going to slow down. Because one thing I definitely want to do eventually
[5762.94s -> 5768.49s]  when I decide to stop whenever that is, is I want to give at least six to 12 months to everybody
[5768.49s -> 5774.10s]  of like still normal shit happening. But people know, right? This is not tomorrow. This is not
[5774.10s -> 5781.61s]  tomorrow. This is not tomorrow. This is not tomorrow. So I would probably give a long lead time.
[5781.61s -> 5792.86s]  Because people have subbed it for a long time and there's a lot of activity in the discord and shit.
[5792.86s -> 5798.04s]  I want like a year of people knowing that that's going to happen, right? This is not something
[5798.04s -> 5805.19s]  that I would announce and then be like, okay, see you later. I was fun. Goodbye. I'm done. No.
[5805.19s -> 5814.95s]  There'd be like a full year of lead up to it. So look, you got, hey, at the very least after
[5814.95s -> 5831.08s]  tomorrow, you've got at least a year. Get away from the camera when I drink. I'm kidding. Just
[5831.08s -> 5840.87s]  relax. Oh my God. It is tomorrow. No, I'm kidding. Show ass. All right. Time that person out. That's
[5840.87s -> 5847.30s]  like the only thing they've written in the last like hour. I do have a great idea for my retirement
[5847.30s -> 5850.58s]  stream though. Like the final retirement stream. And I'll tell you what it is because I think it's
[5850.58s -> 5858.09s]  funny and I don't care. Here's the idea. Don't leak this and don't steal it. I want to get in,
[5858.65s -> 5865.24s]  I want to get in full old person prosthetics and in like a retirement home, be like sitting in the
[5865.24s -> 5877.16s]  corner eating peaches while people just roast me, you know, get, like get a bunch of people that
[5877.16s -> 5882.44s]  have been like, you know, on the stream over the years sit and sit there and I can't even,
[5882.44s -> 5887.85s]  I don't even know what they're saying. I've been full like $5,000 fucking old man prosthetics,
[5887.85s -> 5893.83s]  like slurring peaches and look at the cane just like, and they'll like address me and stuff and
[5893.83s -> 5899.88s]  I won't even look at them. And then I'll get up there when that's my time, right? When it's my
[5899.88s -> 5903.48s]  turn. All right. That was like, no, there it is the retirement. I get up there and I take the
[5903.48s -> 5909.00s]  fuck the lashes off and I give one more, one more fucking, I tell you, you thought that was funny,
[5909.00s -> 5918.60s]  didn't you? And I, and I just go off and it's like, holy shit, he's still got it. There you go.
[5918.60s -> 5929.86s]  That's the whole stream. The final grandpa bit. If we leak it, he can't use it and he can never retire.
[5936.12s -> 5947.64s]  One final sus face. What are you going to do when you stop doing Twitch? I don't know.
[5947.64s -> 5952.12s]  See, the reason why you can expect me not to retire like soon is because I don't fucking know.
[5953.10s -> 5959.26s]  I want to maybe transition over to more traditional content, right? I love making streams.
[5959.26s -> 5964.54s]  I love coming up with ideas. I love producing stuff. I love that. So maybe I would do something
[5964.54s -> 5976.14s]  there. Try move into that part of the industry. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea.
[5976.14s -> 5987.58s]  You should run for president. Somebody, somebody would just leak the naked picture of the smite
[5987.58s -> 6001.66s]  tournament and like, I would lose fucking half the country. I would lose like, I would lose like 30
[6001.66s -> 6022.58s]  states in one hour. You'd get more though. No, I don't think so. Produce the next minions movie.
[6022.58s -> 6026.76s]  You ever thought about doing a live show? I've thought about it before, but I think a lot of
[6026.76s -> 6033.02s]  the stuff that we do on this channel requires a lot of sort of camera tricks and magic behind
[6033.02s -> 6037.10s]  the scenes, right? I feel like a live version of a lot of the stuff wouldn't work that well,
[6037.66s -> 6048.38s]  just because it needs a lot of sort of other stuff in the background. You've been recognized
[6048.38s -> 6054.68s]  in real life. Yeah, actually happens a lot more than you think. A lot more than I thought either
[6054.68s -> 6068.89s]  too. Just go to Hollywood. No, I don't want to go to fucking Hollywood. If I go to Hollywood,
[6068.89s -> 6083.61s]  no, that's how you know it's over. That's how you know I'm retiring. No, not Hollywood. I wouldn't
[6083.61s -> 6088.50s]  cut it in Hollywood. Nope. I would go to an audition. I would get told that I was not for the
[6088.50s -> 6097.75s]  part and I would cry on the way out and I would move. I would have the paper and I would be like,
[6097.75s -> 6121.69s]  like, running out. Do infomercials? Well, you could be an actor. I don't know though. I don't
[6121.69s -> 6130.98s]  know if I want to do that. Hey, Jeremiah, you ever show a barber a picture of a video game
[6130.98s -> 6140.46s]  character when you get a haircut? What video game characters hair do you want? I don't understand
[6140.46s -> 6152.42s]  what. How come every time I comb my hair with a comb, it just looks like I have a toupee on?
[6153.24s -> 6160.73s]  It's too smooth, right? This looks like I'm wearing a hair piece, but now,
[6163.61s -> 6180.04s]  right? Now it doesn't. This is a little too long. It's okay. I'll grow it.
[6180.04s -> 6184.98s]  You show Steve from Minecraft. Will you ever get hair plugs? No. I'm just going bald whenever I
[6184.98s -> 6192.81s]  go bald. If I make it to 40, I'll be happy. Making it to 40 with a full head of hair is fine. I made
[6192.81s -> 6200.44s]  it to the level cap as far as hair goes. If you have a full head of hair at 40 years old, you made
[6200.44s -> 6219.38s]  it to the hair level cap. Good for you. You won. That's fine. Keep coping. It's 60. It's 40. I'll
[6219.38s -> 6234.22s]  give you 45. No, no grays either. No, not that I can tell. Not that I can really see. What's your
[6234.22s -> 6248.31s]  secret? Okay. You want the secret. I drink green tea and I moisturize every day. That's it. I'm a
[6248.31s -> 6256.49s]  big green tea guy and I moisturize my face with a good moisturizer. Done. You eat garlic? I love
[6256.49s -> 6271.99s]  garlic. Yeah, all the time. It's the Botox. Nope. I've never had work done. Dude, garlic is a secret.
[6272.79s -> 6281.03s]  Garlic is a secret, but don't overdo garlic because it can actually be kind of not great for you.
[6281.03s -> 6286.71s]  A nice like a nice green tea. What are your thoughts on the 2004 World Series squad for
[6286.71s -> 6293.21s]  the Red Sox? I have, okay, I'll give you an opinion on that.
[6293.21s -> 6311.93s]  That song played in every business, on every street, in every house. It was background
[6311.93s -> 6322.78s]  noise. It was white noise for all of 2005 and 2006 after the Red Sox won the World Series.
[6322.86s -> 6325.58s]  You'd be in the car with the radio on.
[6331.00s -> 6336.76s]  Okay, Boston, you're my home. Okay, let's go in this business.
[6343.48s -> 6349.64s]  Dude, fucking airlines were probably like flights coming into Boston after the 2004 World Series.
[6349.72s -> 6354.46s]  It was probably like, ladies and gentlemen, we are starting our descent into Boston,
[6355.26s -> 6366.36s]  home of the World Series champions. And they just played it. Five people know what you're
[6366.36s -> 6384.10s]  talking about? Okay, this is what I'm talking about. This first 10 seconds was everywhere.
[6391.72s -> 6400.42s]  Oh, yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, we are starting our descent into the beautiful city of Boston,
[6400.42s -> 6411.00s]  Massachusetts, home of the World Series champions 2004. Cloudy day in Boston, 65 degrees. We're
[6411.00s -> 6426.90s]  landing shortly. And everyone's just like, and everybody's in full Red Sox fan gear. Everyone.
[6426.90s -> 6433.10s]  Everybody. They have a hat. They have a shirt. They have like wristbands. And then when it
[6433.10s -> 6444.17s]  when it gets to this part here, the whole fucking plane yells it. Hold on here. That dirty water.
[6444.81s -> 6448.97s]  Everybody. Boston, you're my home.
[6451.13s -> 6466.04s]  Everyone's just fucking everyone's just so happy. After 2004, my parents painted my room and made it
[6466.04s -> 6474.76s]  Red Sox themed. Yes. And how many times did you open up the door to your house? And okay, hold on
[6474.76s -> 6484.92s]  for all of you Boston East coasters out there. How many times did your parents watch the DVD
[6484.92s -> 6492.60s]  presentation of the World Series championship cowboy up? How many times did your parents watch
[6492.60s -> 6503.14s]  the cowboy up DVD after they won the special edition of the documentary of them winning?
[6503.14s -> 6510.15s]  I was probably once a week I would be like in my house and I would just walk I would
[6510.15s -> 6515.03s]  be walking around and I would just hear like the intro to that to that DVD.
[6519.37s -> 6535.99s]  If you're cute, if you're like, what the fuck is he talking about? They play this song at the end
[6535.99s -> 6549.38s]  of every Red Sox win. If the Red Sox win the game at Fenway Park, they play this. No wonder you are
[6549.38s -> 6559.26s]  like this. This is so funny dude. Boston sounds like a cartoon town. It kind of is.
[6575.13s -> 6584.95s]  Wait, didn't hold on. I feel like they did a cover. Did they do a cover? Is this I feel
[6584.95s -> 6592.44s]  like I heard this one a shitload? Have I ever heard? Yeah, the Dropkick Murphys. Did they ever
[6592.44s -> 6616.76s]  do a cover of this? I got an ad. Hold on. That's right. This is live somewhere. Listen, everybody
[6616.76s -> 6633.66s]  screaming. This was probably impromptu. Dropkick Murphys probably like, hey, Red Sox just won the
[6633.66s -> 6657.27s]  fucking World Series. They're good too. They're residency for me. Fucking come on. What's up
[6657.27s -> 6667.58s]  Germaniacs? Stop calling people Germaniacs. That's not the correct term. Stop saying that.
[6667.58s -> 6673.75s]  I keep seeing that and it's kind of pissing me off. You're not the Germaniacs. No, you are the
[6673.75s -> 6680.63s]  Germimites. I don't know how many more times I have to say this. Not the Germimites. Germimites.
[6680.63s -> 6685.83s]  Excuse me, the Germimites. The Germimites. You're not the Germaniacs. Not the Germimites.
[6686.23s -> 6704.65s]  No, you're not the Germs. You are the Germimites. I keep seeing that. Drew Crew. I was there at the
[6704.65s -> 6723.38s]  start when we were the Germs. Yeah. Yeah, you were for a while. Not the Germanians. Plus like. Yeah,
[6723.38s -> 6729.85s]  I remember at the end of every video saying, hey, plus like if you'd like the video. I never wanted
[6729.85s -> 6737.43s]  to say it though. I always hated saying it because to me it was like, oh hey, make sure you like the
[6737.43s -> 6743.70s]  video. Well, I don't know. Did they like it? What if you hated it? Then I look like a dickhead.
[6743.78s -> 6747.62s]  Like you, I didn't want you to like the video if you didn't like the video. So I didn't want to
[6747.62s -> 6753.30s]  look like a shithead and be like, dude, like the video. Make sure to hit that like button.
[6753.30s -> 6759.29s]  Well, dude, what if this video sucks? Then that's not accurate. You pressed like already. That's
[6759.29s -> 6773.02s]  not accurate. I never liked to say that. Please rate the video. Yeah, there you go. That's better.
[6773.02s -> 6787.22s]  Are you a gamer? I beat Cuphead a couple days ago in about an hour and 40 minutes. I would say so.
[6787.22s -> 6790.66s]  You played the organ during Dawnhouse. What instruments do you play? I know how to play
[6790.66s -> 6798.97s]  the drums. I know how to play the drums. Very sparingly. Not really though. Like kind of.
[6798.97s -> 6811.16s]  Are you a guy that fell asleep to Five Nights at Freddy's? Um, very briefly. I gave the PAX East
[6811.16s -> 6823.54s]  video one star. What's your favorite thing of all the stuff behind you? I can't pick, these are all,
[6823.54s -> 6833.40s]  I can't pick a favorite child. Come on. I can't pick a favorite child. You have a vape pen? No.
[6833.40s -> 6841.08s]  Didn't they ban, isn't vaping banned now? I read that. What happened? They banned vaping. The vape
[6841.08s -> 6855.35s]  pens. Which ones? They banned Juul. Juul is banned in the United States now. What separated Juul
[6855.35s -> 6867.69s]  from all the other ones? Good night? Hey, have a good night. It's too much nicotine. Tons of
[6867.69s -> 6892.58s]  nicotine and marketed to kids. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Juul appeals to young people. Big tobacco.
[6892.58s -> 6901.29s]  The company was bought up by Philip Morris. Oh. They're banning disposables in the UK at some
[6901.29s -> 6909.08s]  point. Saj, what will I do when I'm hammered on a night out? Um, you could not smoke inhaled nicotine.
[6911.94s -> 6920.95s]  I know that's really easy to say, but cigarettes are bad. Nicotine is bad. Cigarettes are bad.
[6920.95s -> 6923.83s]  Don't smoke. I'm not going to say that because like, look, I'm not going to tell you what to do
[6923.83s -> 6933.14s]  with your life. Smoking is bad. You shouldn't do it. Vaping is an alternative. That's still nicotine
[6933.14s -> 6939.40s]  and still a bunch of bullshit you're inhaling into your lungs. But look, but I'm me sitting here
[6939.40s -> 6949.10s]  going like you smoke cigarettes, you vape. And I thought we could be friends. I don't, I don't
[6949.10s -> 6958.04s]  care. You know what I mean? You really shouldn't be doing it though. Right in the middle. Get it
[6958.04s -> 6961.96s]  right in the middle. It's right in the middle. So, you know, these people can't be mad at me.
[6961.96s -> 6967.56s]  These, the smokers can't be pissed. The nonsmokers can't be pissed. We're right there. Perfect.
[6967.56s -> 6977.38s]  Perfectly placed. Cigarettes actually really piss me off though. They actually really do.
[6977.38s -> 6984.54s]  When they, okay, let me tell you something about cigarettes. Um, Las Vegas. No, you want me, you
[6984.54s -> 6991.03s]  want a non-centrist Andy? Take fine. I'll give it to you. Cigarettes are fucking annoying. Okay?
[6991.03s -> 6997.58s]  I live in Las Vegas, obviously, where smoking is, is allowed in the casinos. You can literally
[6997.58s -> 7003.26s]  just walk around inside and smoke pretty much 90% of the entire floor. You can just smoke
[7003.26s -> 7015.51s]  in the casino. MGM, near the company MGM, they decided, they said, hey, um, we're going to make
[7015.51s -> 7027.22s]  Park MGM smoke free now. 100% smoke free. I almost shit my pants because it's the only casino on the
[7027.22s -> 7034.46s]  strip. It's the only casino right now, I think, in Vegas that I can think of that is smoke free.
[7034.46s -> 7042.78s]  And oh my God, it's, oh, you mean I can, I can go like hang out and meet friends and there's not
[7042.78s -> 7051.16s]  somebody like this, like this. My face, by the way, is right here. Oh yeah. Hit me. Oh, I'm sorry. Is
[7051.16s -> 7057.24s]  that glove blowing directly into your nostrils? I don't fucking give a shit. Oh my God. Having the
[7057.24s -> 7065.58s]  smoke free casino, doing more of them, more, more, more, more smoke free casinos. I, every time
[7065.58s -> 7070.81s]  somebody ever comes into Vegas and they're like, oh, what do you want to do? Hey, um, you ever heard
[7070.81s -> 7075.61s]  of Park MGM? I mean, it's, it's a smaller casino. Um, it's, you ever heard of that? That's where you
[7075.61s -> 7082.63s]  should go. We should go to Park MGM. I think it's like cool and clean. Park MGM. Like how do we show
[7082.63s -> 7091.00s]  them that it's awesome? How do we show them this? Cause you know that they're definitely counting
[7091.00s -> 7097.93s]  fucking shit in the back room. I don't know. The whole smoking ban in Park MGM didn't really work
[7097.93s -> 7111.69s]  out. We lost 10% customer base. Turn the cigarettes back on. I love Park MGM. Keep it smoke free. God
[7111.69s -> 7127.37s]  damn it. I have nothing against people smoking a cigarette. What I, I don't, I just don't want to
[7127.37s -> 7132.81s]  be sitting next to somebody at a blackjack table. That's just, that's just, I'm breathing in their
[7132.81s -> 7138.73s]  cigarette for them. There have been cases when I've been down on the strip or downtown in Vegas,
[7138.73s -> 7144.09s]  wherever I am, whatever is casino. And I'm just trying to hang out and I am smoking someone's
[7144.09s -> 7148.87s]  fucking, I'm smoking someone else's cigarette. I'm that, that's, I'm that close. It's not like,
[7148.87s -> 7153.19s]  oh, I smell cigarettes. There's a cigarette in this room. No, like you are holding it here
[7153.19s -> 7166.97s]  and my fucking face is here. I am smoking your cigarette. God, it's a tactic to win more.
[7166.97s -> 7171.69s]  In blackjack, we all play against the dealer. There's no, you know, there's no psychological,
[7172.81s -> 7181.98s]  you know, it's a poker. You want me to lose at the table? What are you talking about?
[7181.98s -> 7187.35s]  Why would I, why would you want me to lose? We all play against the dealer in blackjack.
[7187.35s -> 7192.02s]  How often do you visit the strip? Once every, I want to say three or four months,
[7192.02s -> 7213.85s]  once a quarter, maybe once or twice a quarter. Yeah. I, cigarettes, I just don't like them.
[7213.85s -> 7221.34s]  Cigarettes have a very distinct smell too. That's just painful. I will smell weed, right? Like
[7221.34s -> 7229.38s]  somebody's smoking weed and it's like, Oh, somebody's, Ooh, Oh, somebody's smoking. What's
[7229.38s -> 7236.95s]  that? What's hmm. When I, a cigarette, it's like, I don't know where the fuck that's coming from,
[7236.95s -> 7242.90s]  but I want to get away from it now. Okay. Yep. I think it's come, let's go this way. Come with me.
[7242.90s -> 7255.50s]  Let's go over there. Let's, yeah, let's go this way. Like through there. If they're good cigarettes,
[7255.50s -> 7270.63s]  it smells good. Weed smells good. We can, yeah, but also we usually, weed's a lot more powerful.
[7275.40s -> 7281.58s]  What's on your shirt? Well, glad you asked. This is the Hash House A Go Go pancake. And by the way,
[7281.58s -> 7292.36s]  that's actual size. By the way, that's actual size. Yeah. And by the way, actual size.
[7292.92s -> 7302.62s]  Do you want pancakes? Three o'clock in the morning and you're near the link. Hash House A Go Go. Best
[7302.62s -> 7308.09s]  pancakes, best cheeseburger I've ever had. Best burger I've ever had. Weed smells like
[7308.09s -> 7326.62s]  a moldy carpet. It's better than an old ass tray. Why did you staple a pancake to your shirt?
[7326.62s -> 7333.51s]  That'd be weird. What's the burger? It is the blue cheeseburger at Hash House A Go Go.
[7334.07s -> 7339.14s]  I gave you a secret message at the end of that. I don't know if you can decode it.
[7339.14s -> 7358.70s]  That's my favorite music. I really don't really listen to that much music. Dude,
[7358.70s -> 7366.76s]  that pancake is bigger than your head. They're huge. Yeah, I know. You eat music. You're a blue
[7366.76s -> 7376.18s]  cheese fan. Yes. Yeah, I like it a lot. If you don't listen to music, what the fuck do you do?
[7376.18s -> 7393.27s]  I don't know. Watch TV and work on stuff. Go out. Go to dinner. Take a walk. Run errands. What do
[7393.27s -> 7398.95s]  people do? No, you're not going to pull this shit again. Somebody said, like a couple years ago,
[7398.95s -> 7402.15s]  what was it? They were like, oh, hey, man. Yes. Prove you're not a serial killer. What do you
[7402.15s -> 7408.62s]  do for the other eight hours during the day? And it's just, I don't know, man. What the fuck
[7408.62s -> 7412.66s]  do you do for the other eight hours or six hours during the day? What do you do for like eight
[7412.66s -> 7421.50s]  hours during the day? I watch TV. I do run errands, do some chores, make phone calls,
[7421.50s -> 7430.63s]  talk to some people, spend time with some people. What else do you do? Play games. You play video
[7430.63s -> 7439.77s]  games with, you know, get on Discord. What else do you do? And because I couldn't give five straight
[7439.77s -> 7447.67s]  hours of things that I would do after I turned the stream off or something, it's like you Googled
[7447.67s -> 7467.99s]  what normal people do. I just told you how Park MGM, I love that place. Like, oh, I go to Park MGM
[7467.99s -> 7476.22s]  and hang out. Who are you talking to? That joke is really funny, but I'm whatever. I laugh every time
[7476.22s -> 7493.85s]  I see that. Would you ever go to a non-YouTube or non-gaming convention, like an anime convention
[7493.85s -> 7502.82s]  or a pop culture convention? Probably not. I did the convention thing for a long time. And I don't
[7502.82s -> 7510.33s]  know. Probably not. Furry convention. I told you the only way I would go to a furry convention is
[7510.33s -> 7515.94s]  if I was in a full costume and no one ever knew it was me. I may have already done this. I may have
[7515.94s -> 7524.89s]  already done this. How would you ever know? Be in a full furry costume that has no ways to see who
[7524.89s -> 7537.18s]  is in there. And I have rooms at like seven hotels. So I could always like, wait, is that him? No,
[7537.18s -> 7540.70s]  I'm in a different, I'm in a different hotel tonight. No one fucking knows who I am. No one
[7540.70s -> 7552.63s]  knows where I am. I genuinely believe we would know. No, you would not. You would not. How would
[7552.63s -> 7559.18s]  you know? If I went to a furry convention and I was in a full fursuit and was just walking around
[7559.18s -> 7569.02s]  going like this, like, and I didn't do, I didn't move around too much and I didn't make it. I know.
[7569.02s -> 7582.42s]  Why would I be talking? I would not be, I would not say a single word. How would you ever know?
[7582.42s -> 7587.45s]  And then I would get to the hotel. I would go to the hotel room and make sure like I,
[7587.45s -> 7595.10s]  nobody knew who I was. And then I would just take it off and go to bed. And every time I came out
[7595.10s -> 7604.98s]  of the room, I'd be in the full suit. So no one would ever know. Why would you know I was in there?
[7604.98s -> 7620.33s]  You would be applying chapstick through the mask. Just like, you'd have wicked bad garlic breath.
[7620.33s -> 7624.73s]  No, and I would not be doing any like, like movements. I wouldn't want you guys to know the
[7624.73s -> 7634.79s]  movements. It would be super generic. Like that's it. I wouldn't do a single other move. There'd be
[7634.79s -> 7653.93s]  no like walking, like, look at me. No, it would just be chills. I hate that. You ever happen to
[7653.93s -> 7659.32s]  you where you're just like, you know what it reminds me of? Okay. It's, that's like a dog shaking.
[7659.32s -> 7667.30s]  You know what I mean? Like, you've thought this through. Yes, we've talked about this more than
[7667.30s -> 7681.54s]  once. We've, this is like the third or fourth time we've discussed this. You would not know.
[7681.54s -> 7688.44s]  And honestly, I would never tell you. I would never tell you. You would never know. Years later,
[7688.44s -> 7697.70s]  I wouldn't tell you. You would end up tripping up at one point. No, I wouldn't. You know why I
[7697.70s -> 7705.93s]  wouldn't? Because I'm going to order three of the same exact costume, custom made, and I'm going to
[7705.93s -> 7713.77s]  hire somebody to go into that costume and go down to the convention floor on one of the days. And
[7713.77s -> 7721.24s]  I'm going to have that person take off the helmet and pose for a bunch of pictures and like drink
[7721.24s -> 7732.28s]  out of a bottle of water, like very publicly. Like, and there you are. You would never know.
[7732.28s -> 7743.82s]  You keep telling us what you're going to do. Yeah, but you, how do you, you can't even look for that.
[7743.82s -> 7750.28s]  You, how would you even look for something like that? Oh, that person drank, drank water. Okay.
[7750.28s -> 7761.32s]  That's literally every single person at the whole convention. Don't tell your secrets.
[7761.56s -> 7780.50s]  I could tell you all these secrets. It doesn't matter. Please let me make you a fursuit.
[7782.01s -> 7791.86s]  No, how expensive would the fursuit be? I'm not telling you anything in case I ever decide to do
[7791.86s -> 7797.86s]  this. They have to sign. Yeah. They would have to sign an NDA. Whoever that actor was, they'd have
[7797.86s -> 7806.25s]  to, they would have to sign a document. Oh, but I would pay the fuck out of that person.
[7806.25s -> 7811.30s]  You know what I mean? It would be like, oh, hey, actor, what's your date? What's your day rate
[7811.30s -> 7816.30s]  to fill out? What's your, what's your like day rate as an actor? Okay. Triple it and sign that
[7816.30s -> 7848.12s]  paper. Triple it and sign this NDA. They ain't saying shit. It's 30K for three suits. Holy shit.
[7848.12s -> 7868.92s]  What? It's 3000. It's wait, it's 10K for a big fursuit. What? Holy shit. 10K sounds like a lot.
[7868.92s -> 7881.91s]  3K. Okay. I could see like 5K, 10K, 20K, three to 5K. Okay. I mean, the materials alone are,
[7881.91s -> 7886.17s]  are expensive and the obviously the grade of labor that goes into it makes sense, right?
[7886.73s -> 7898.44s]  But 10 plus 20 plus thousand, 10K is for the popular makers. That makes sense. 20K for a
[7898.44s -> 7914.68s]  high-end suit. Holy shit. New retirement plan. Some suit makers are really high in demand.
[7914.68s -> 7922.68s]  Well fucking good for them. Holy shit. Chain mail is expensive. Wait, what do you mean?
[7923.48s -> 7940.36s]  Chain mail. You're putting chain mail on too. You're putting on chain mail. Why are you putting on
[7940.36s -> 7966.47s]  chain mail for defense? Parry the furries. When are you going to do the slime stream? What?
[7967.03s -> 7975.66s]  Why are you making this so elaborate? Just wear a fursuit. It's 2022. But the fun is, is it,
[7975.66s -> 7985.05s]  is it me? I don't care about putting a fursuit on. I just want it to be impossible for you to know.
[7985.05s -> 7991.90s]  I don't care about wearing a fursuit at all. I just want it to be a mystery. You know what I mean?
[8000.17s -> 8015.14s]  Schrodinger's furry. Am I in there? Am I, am I not in there? That's so stupid. How you been? I've
[8015.14s -> 8025.61s]  been alright. I've been good. I've been pretty good. I'm in Vegas and I'm going to Hash House
[8025.61s -> 8029.45s]  to go-go. I'm going to try it before I go home. Hope it's good. I haven't been there in a while,
[8029.45s -> 8041.90s]  but it was good last time I went. I changed to 480p and the quality didn't change. Would you
[8041.90s -> 8062.10s]  actually genuinely do this? Probably. I met Jeremy at a furry convention. I was at FurCon. I went,
[8062.42s -> 8073.90s]  there it goes. It's gone. Mods are on point. Dude, Mods are on point. That was there for as long
[8073.90s -> 8084.58s]  as it took me to read the first four words. Gone. I have a debate with a friend. Is a hamburger
[8084.58s -> 8099.27s]  outfit a fursuit? No. I mean, is it, are you, no, that's not an anthropomorphic animal. Wouldn't
[8099.27s -> 8110.04s]  that what it is? Is Grimace a furry? No, Grimace, what is Grimace? Is Grimace a furry? What is,
[8110.12s -> 8127.34s]  what is Grimace? Grimace is an alien, right? What is Grimace? Grimace is a muppet. He's supposed to
[8127.34s -> 8138.58s]  be a nugget. No, really? Grimace is the cookie monster, but from McDonald's food. But what
[8138.58s -> 8152.71s]  animal is Grimace? A bison? He's an eggplant. He's supposed to be a human. Wait, Grimace is supposed
[8152.71s -> 8174.07s]  to be a guy? He's the purple cookie, but what is Cookie Monster? What is Grimace? McDonald's managers
[8174.07s -> 8183.10s]  clarify the character. Okay. The lovable spherical shaped purple character Grimace has always been
[8183.10s -> 8188.49s]  one of McDonald's most recognizable faces. Even if fans never knew what he actually is.
[8188.49s -> 8194.97s]  Okay. Ronald McDonald is a clown. Mayor McCheese is a cheeseburger. Birdie the early bird is a bird.
[8195.61s -> 8202.89s]  The Hamburglar is a thief. A Mac tonight is a moon. And the fry kids are fries. What the heck is
[8202.89s -> 8210.22s]  Grimace? Okay. Nobody knew what he was until now. Late last month, the manager of McDonald's in
[8210.22s -> 8215.27s]  Canada revealed the answer to the Golden Arches Biggest Mystery, telling CBC News that Grimace
[8215.27s -> 8240.57s]  is an enormous taste bud. Huh? That's fucking inflamed. That shit's inflamed. I thought maybe
[8240.57s -> 8250.79s]  it was a piece of candy. A gumdrop or something. Enormous taste bud? Can we just say he's a big
[8250.79s -> 8262.66s]  piece of taffy? That makes more sense. It's not inflamed. Wait, he also, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[8262.66s -> 8272.95s]  McDonald's reached out. Hold on. McDonald's stepped in here. McDonald's offered some clarification in
[8272.95s -> 8280.31s]  the statement. Whether he's a taste bud, a milkshake, or just your favorite purple blob,
[8280.31s -> 8283.99s]  the best part about Grimace is that he means different things to different people. Whatever
[8283.99s -> 8295.34s]  he is, we're just proud. Our bestie makes people happy. A milkshake? So he's a milkshake. He's a
[8295.34s -> 8304.98s]  bestie? Okay, into, hold on, it gets deeper. In 2012, McDonald's Corp tweeted from their official
[8304.98s -> 8311.46s]  account that Grimace was, in quotes, and I'm quoting, the embodiment of a milkshake, though
[8311.46s -> 8317.43s]  others still insist he's a taste bud. The account tweeted something similar in 2014 saying Grimace
[8317.43s -> 8335.88s]  lore says he is the embodiment of a milkshake or taste bud. So he's a milkshake? That's a pretty
[8335.88s -> 8353.10s]  gross ass milkshake. He's the embodiment of a milkshake. He's not a milkshake. He is the
[8353.10s -> 8364.15s]  embodiment of a milkshake. All right, so he's like a milkshake in theory. Thick? Creamy? What is it?
[8364.15s -> 8384.54s]  What else is a milkshake? Biblically accurate. Juicy? Every time I see Grimace, I just think of
[8384.54s -> 8390.78s]  the Barney the Dinosaur jump run. You guys know what I'm talking about? The I'm in a mascot suit.
[8390.78s -> 8395.46s]  I'm gonna do the excited jump run in the air for a quarter of a second where they go like,
[8396.02s -> 8400.66s]  and their legs go one, two, three, four, da, da, da. They like jump and their arms go like this and
[8400.66s -> 8408.15s]  their legs go like this and they kind of maybe go like that. It's the quintessential mascot is excited
[8408.15s -> 8414.97s]  jump. I just see Grimace doing that. Barney the Dinosaur used to do this all the time.
[8414.97s -> 8421.94s]  He would jump then his legs would go hoo hoo hoo. When was the last time you had a purple milkshake?
[8421.94s -> 8434.63s]  Never. We can hear your stomach? You probably can. Holy shit, you probably can. You can hear my...
[8434.63s -> 8487.21s]  Stop listening to me. Don't do that. I'm hungry. He's trying to convince us that he's human. I have
[8487.93s -> 8501.00s]  internal organs. I'm hungry. Go eat. This stream is not gonna be that much longer. I'm just gonna be
[8501.00s -> 8513.91s]  gone for a while. Well, not a while, like five days, four days away from the stream. He has a
[8513.91s -> 8523.21s]  loudspeaker in his stomach. Oh, but when we come back, you'll see me again. You'll see me again.
[8523.21s -> 8529.99s]  Maybe over there. You'll see me again. I'll be back. Not maybe. Of course I'll be back. When is
[8529.99s -> 8539.78s]  the Castle Griffin's deed? I don't know. I have a bunch of mods I want to do for GTA V, Elden Ring,
[8539.78s -> 8547.70s]  and Skyrim. We're going to leave that to next week. I've also got Call of Duty. Call of Duty
[8547.70s -> 8552.76s]  one campaign that I've been talking about for a long time that I want to play. There's also
[8553.48s -> 8557.80s]  the jumping jack stream where I do 10 jumping jacks and then turn it off.
[8558.44s -> 8565.78s]  And that's what I did for work today. There's that. There's that important stream. There's
[8569.00s -> 8586.94s]  the count stream where we count to a hundred. What about Grotto Beast? Grotto Beast is coming.
[8586.94s -> 8593.59s]  Grotto Beast is coming. I don't have a hard date for you, but it's this year, this year,
[8593.59s -> 8601.35s]  this year, actually this year, sooner than you think. Follow that Twitter. They post updates.
[8601.35s -> 8612.87s]  Go check it out. Grotto Beasts. You'd never be able to count to a hundred and thirty minutes.
[8612.87s -> 8614.95s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, four,
[8614.95s -> 8620.73s]  five, six, seven, eight, nine, twenty. Did I skip a whole thing? Wait, what? One, two, three, four,
[8620.73s -> 8622.73s]  five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[8622.73s -> 8663.88s]  nine, twenty. It hasn't been thirty minutes. Dummy. Also the green screen stuff. If you want
[8663.88s -> 8669.88s]  a submission read the rules you have until the 17th at midnight technically which is the 18th
[8669.88s -> 8676.38s]  at midnight so midnight 12 o'clock july 18th whatever you want to call it that's when it's
[8676.38s -> 8680.78s]  over read the rules if you want to do a green screen video there's a lot of things you have
[8680.78s -> 8685.05s]  to pay attention to and a lot of rules you have to follow so please follow them i've heard this
[8685.05s -> 8691.16s]  some really good ones so far you got another week and a half or so to do it rules don't apply to us
[8691.24s -> 8698.78s]  well then they're not going to be shown on the stream so i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm very sobby okay i'm
[8698.78s -> 8720.41s]  sobby but if you do not follow the rules then i'm sobby it's not you're not going to be on stream
[8720.41s -> 8728.55s]  auctioneer andy what do you say have you seen any of them i have peeked i did peek i've peeked a
[8728.55s -> 8738.50s]  little some of them i've seen like two and they're fucking funny yeah go to discord you have a week
[8738.50s -> 8744.68s]  and a half i want to do that actually there's gonna be some pretty cool the end of july is
[8744.68s -> 8753.75s]  gonna be pretty stacked baseball's happening on the 24th and then the next stream that i do coming
[8753.75s -> 8759.14s]  back from baseball is going to be the green screen movie night i think that that would work out
[8759.14s -> 8766.68s]  pretty well so there'll be two really really fun things in a row because i want that stream to be
[8766.68s -> 8772.70s]  somewhere in the end of july two weeks to have you guys make videos and then maybe a week to
[8772.70s -> 8784.42s]  10 days to vet them get a good playlist do you think you bring back community content night after
[8784.42s -> 8798.79s]  i don't know maybe i would do an encore night again maybe maybe i don't want to say that oh
[8798.79s -> 8802.07s]  yeah let's bring community content night back because it's not inaccurate i'm just not prepared
[8802.07s -> 8809.77s]  for it july 24th is baseball i know i've moved it three times now but desperately trying behind
[8809.77s -> 8821.98s]  the scenes to make sure the show can go off in july and not have to wait any longer recommend
[8821.98s -> 8828.60s]  video editing software um premier is good premier pro is just solid everything you need for it i
[8828.60s -> 8838.07s]  used to use it all the time it was my editor of choice when are you and stir going to do the
[8838.07s -> 8842.87s]  remake and old channel vid yeah we talked about it we talked about it it's just stir got uh stir
[8842.87s -> 8849.66s]  had a lot of stuff going on with myriad and i mean the dude's making a full entire from scratch video
[8849.66s -> 8856.71s]  game rule set so he's he's pretty busy maybe i'll see if he's got time in the next you know month
[8856.71s -> 8868.18s]  or so because i think that's a really funny idea i think there's a lot of potential for that one
[8868.18s -> 8873.93s]  you're hyping up baseball are you sure it's confident as good as you want it to be i don't
[8873.93s -> 8882.23s]  know i've never thought like that though even before stuff like dollhouse or the replacement
[8882.23s -> 8890.30s]  show or the desert you know grotto beast thing carnival i i just think i'm just gonna if it's
[8890.30s -> 8900.28s]  fun it's fun let me try usually they are you might be under hyping baseball the reason why i have
[8900.28s -> 8907.50s]  not been going heavy into baseball is because we didn't know for sure the day and we had to
[8907.58s -> 8914.50s]  keep changing it so you see how a month ago it was the 14th of july then it became the 20th now
[8914.50s -> 8921.06s]  it's the 24th so now that we get a real day and a real date we're going to lay into a lot of uh
[8921.06s -> 8929.58s]  probably a lot of pr for it so don't worry you will know you will see but yeah i'm just going
[8929.58s -> 8934.26s]  to get up there and try to have fun and try to do the stuff that i wrote down on a piece of paper
[8934.26s -> 8949.02s]  that's it hey uh will you apologize hold on for laughing at me because i said i watched the care
[8949.02s -> 8955.03s]  bears at 24 my life's been an absolute shambles since i didn't i didn't my intention was not to
[8955.03s -> 8966.62s]  make fun of anybody i don't care what you're watching you put shambles in all caps though so
[8966.62s -> 8976.92s]  i'm kind of no no no i'm not laughing at the fact that you watch care bears i'm laughing at the
[8976.92s -> 8982.78s]  scenario of me apologizing to you for laughing at you for watching the care bears you understand
[8982.78s -> 8990.54s]  that's a there's a lot going on around this it's not just one little thing i don't care i don't
[8990.54s -> 8997.38s]  care i really don't if you enjoy television enjoy the shows that you would enjoy okay
[8997.38s -> 9005.74s]  i'm not i don't want to make fun of anybody come on and i won't except for this guy this guy right
[9005.74s -> 9018.47s]  here what he just said he said are you gonna play the demon souls remake not fucking happy with this

[9087.67s -> 9096.36s]  honestly i would rather buy a playstation 5 off of one of you guys for five times what it costs
[9096.36s -> 9108.52s]  then do that online you can order from the playstation website oh all right maybe i'll
[9108.52s -> 9119.67s]  get one but you'll pay triple to sign a non-disclosure agreement or and an nda
[9121.75s -> 9129.40s]  that is a transaction between me and somebody that is not okay here's how it's different
[9129.40s -> 9134.65s]  here's how it's different if i got the actor into the room and i was like all right man so
[9134.65s -> 9138.41s]  here's what you're gonna do all right like i'm gonna get in directing mode okay so you're gonna
