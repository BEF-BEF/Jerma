[1.78s -> 9.54s]  Hey. Yeah, sorry. Sorry I'm late. Uh, I wasn't supposed to be. I was sitting here.
[10.50s -> 19.56s]  Just ready to go. We were pre-stream chatting. I was here. And then, I had to take out the dog.
[20.36s -> 28.63s]  That was true. I didn't even tell any lies. I just didn't tell you the truth. I was holding
[28.63s -> 34.31s]  back the truth from you. I wasn't lying to you. I just wasn't telling you what was going on.
[35.03s -> 40.78s]  Is that a lie? That's not lying. I just wasn't telling you the truth. I wasn't telling you
[40.78s -> 49.27s]  anything. Is withholding information a lie, or is that just withholding information? That's not a
[49.27s -> 64.54s]  lie. That's just withholding info. It's called a lie of omission. Well anyways, uh, I had to update
[64.54s -> 72.22s]  my GeForce 1080. Apparently there's an update today, and oh boy, Halo Reach is going to be
[72.22s -> 78.63s]  running at over 100 fps. I can guarantee you that one. That was a pre-stream chat joke. I know I
[78.63s -> 83.51s]  told everybody in the pre-stream before that I don't do- that's exclusive material for pre-stream
[83.51s -> 97.80s]  chat, and I just used it. So, sorry. You have a million dollars. Get a 2080 Ti. Um, I don't have
[97.80s -> 105.62s]  a million dollars. You're off- your math is off by a little. I do not have a million dollars.
[109.35s -> 120.26s]  He has five million. Nope. Nope. Look, when you spend all your money on carnivals,
[121.30s -> 136.71s]  Halloweens, and Minecraft servers, your CPA gets kind of annoyed with you. He's a trillionaire.
[136.71s -> 142.73s]  He's broke. I'm not- I'm not- okay, let me be very clear. I don't have a million dollars,
[142.73s -> 150.47s]  but I ain't broke, all right? But I got a very loud phone call, uh, back in October from my
[150.47s -> 156.23s]  financial advisor. It was a loud voicemail. I could not tell most of the things that they
[156.23s -> 159.83s]  were saying because it sounded like they were yelling very loud into an iPhone,
[159.83s -> 164.79s]  and you know what happens when you- when you scream into an iPhone? It- it gets distorted,
[164.79s -> 171.67s]  so it was like, I- I can't- so I have no idea what he- what he was saying. Something about-
[172.39s -> 177.02s]  I can't believe- why- why would you do that? I don't know, something like that. Anyways,
[177.02s -> 188.23s]  we're gonna continue the Outer Worlds. What the hell is a carnival stream? All jokes aside,
[188.23s -> 192.73s]  don't worry, I'm doing fine. I don't have a million dollars, though. I- I will do, like,
[192.73s -> 196.65s]  a celebratory stream if I ever have a million dollars in my fucking checking account.
[197.45s -> 207.02s]  Why would I do that? That would be fucked up. Imagine- imagine somebody doing a fucking stream
[207.66s -> 215.53s]  about, I did it, I made it to a million dollars. That's some next level fucking, like,
[215.53s -> 225.10s]  dystopian future type shit. I should just do that without having any of that money. That's
[225.10s -> 229.90s]  a funny stream. It's like a celebration of me crossing a million dollars, and I- and there's
[229.90s -> 234.14s]  not, like, not even five percent of that in my bank accounts across every account I own.
[234.94s -> 240.74s]  All my retirement accounts, like, imagine, like, imagine that? It would be just, like, fake.
[241.62s -> 244.87s]  All right, you know, like that big- big controversy on Instagram where people were
[244.87s -> 248.79s]  taking pictures in their backyard and pretending they were going on vacation to Hawaii? That's
[248.79s -> 267.46s]  what that is. I did it! I made it to a million dollars! And then, like, turns out, I didn't,
[267.46s -> 271.78s]  like, sell my car and shit, like, I didn't have enough money. It's like, what a fucked up future.
[271.78s -> 290.12s]  What a fucked up stream. Hey, speaking of fucking weird futures, here's one right here. Why is my
[290.12s -> 296.62s]  iPhone not working? I- I- I- ah! This man- I got a million dollars, and I couldn't get an iPhone to
[296.62s -> 313.37s]  work? I'm just gonna pick up right where we left off. If you don't know, I'm currently playing the
[313.37s -> 324.47s]  laugh-out-loud hysterical guy. Dumb character. You've never seen that before. Not only am I
[324.47s -> 331.72s]  playing the game, like, three and a half weeks late, I'm also playing the thing that you may
[331.72s -> 336.04s]  have already watched. Somebody do ten times. But it's different because I'm a doctor, too.
[337.35s -> 344.90s]  And I might be doing other choices. And I got a million dollars. Anybody else that you watch got
[344.90s -> 358.36s]  a million dollars? Probably. Probably way more than that. All right, let's get out of here. Let's get
[358.36s -> 367.72s]  going. Actually, I gotta tweet this. I'm sorry I missed the context of that joke. Why is he talking
[367.72s -> 378.31s]  about having a million dollars? Uh, yeah, you had to be there. Okay. What should I write for a tweet?
[378.31s -> 382.39s]  How about just- and I'm just, like, gonna- I'm relaxing today. We're just gonna take it nice and
[382.39s -> 393.96s]  slow. More stupid doctor. I'm not even a doctor. Yeah, I am. More- how about more lying doctor?
[396.79s -> 404.74s]  You don't ever want your doctor to be a liar. That would be really bad. He comes in with, like,
[404.74s -> 416.30s]  your x-ray, and you've got- you've got, like, a- like, a tear in your lung. And he just tells you,
[417.02s -> 425.59s]  well, I got your x-ray of your lungs back. And, whew, you got stomach acid problem.
[425.59s -> 435.78s]  We're gonna get you on some antacids. You don't want that. Okay, more lying doctor. All right,
[435.78s -> 444.18s]  let's move. We can go now. Why would they do that? Because they're a liar. They're a lying doctor.
[444.18s -> 448.02s]  That's the character I am. That's the character I'm playing right now in this game is a lying-
[448.58s -> 458.60s]  an imbecile lying doctor. And the ToastFart just came in with five community subs. Thank you,
[458.60s -> 463.24s]  ToastFart. Appreciate that. Thanks, everybody who got those subs, because that means you're here
[463.24s -> 474.12s]  and you're watching. Thanks to you, too. That's a really fucked up looking pig, okay? All right,
[474.12s -> 479.32s]  I was just gonna say, if this game is gonna run like shit now after I updated my drivers,
[479.32s -> 501.67s]  I'm gonna be pretty mad. I think it's okay. It's all right. Fucking g-force. No, it's all right. I
[501.67s -> 509.24s]  think it's just initial loading of the game. All right, so let's take a look at what we- where we-
[509.24s -> 513.88s]  where we left off. So last thing I did was I angered a lot of people in the stream because I
[513.88s -> 520.04s]  gave power to Edgewater. And then the next thing I did is I have to convince all these people from
[520.04s -> 526.44s]  the settlement now to move back to Edgewater. And one of them said, I ain't going anywhere until you
[527.72s -> 534.36s]  find me my friend Zoe, whoever it was, and I found Zoe. And Zoe had a ring that I took
[535.62s -> 541.46s]  and brought back, and I completed that quest. None of that was a lie. That was just what happened.
[541.46s -> 548.52s]  That's the truth. So and then the other person that has to come along is this- this engineer
[548.52s -> 557.64s]  here. The three volumes. Tom said he knows that at least one volume is in the local community center
[558.20s -> 565.66s]  because this is another person that- well, I have to convince all these people to leave.
[566.54s -> 573.94s]  So let's do that. Engineering volume one, engineering vol- I can get all of them?
[574.66s -> 581.00s]  And no, this is not- I know you may have seen a playthrough of somebody that threw like a
[581.00s -> 594.22s]  grenade over there. That's not this one. This one, sometimes people die. That's it. That's it. Not-
[594.22s -> 603.27s]  we're not- not intentional. Let's go get volume one. Just fast travel. But isn't fast travel
[603.51s -> 615.45s]  boring? I'm- I don't like fast travel. Walking is boring, I guess.
[618.06s -> 626.46s]  Fast travel is more fun. We get more gerbamite content. All right, it's in the community center.
[626.46s -> 633.42s]  Let's get it. Turn my mic up? Yeah, what's- what's going on with my mic lately? Hold on.
[636.54s -> 649.03s]  Ever since- let me look at this. Hold on. You tell- you tell me if it gets to be too bad.
[657.27s -> 657.95s]  Bad?
[662.78s -> 669.96s]  That's good, right? How's that? That's better, right? But what- once I scream, it's gonna be bad.
[669.96s -> 676.47s]  All right, no, that's fine. That's good. That's fine. That's better. I think that's better. Yeah,
[676.47s -> 688.97s]  that's better. Are these bad guys? They are. He's blind. Did I just shoot a blind guy?
[689.85s -> 703.16s]  Uh oh. I just fucking missed three times. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[709.80s -> 722.81s]  Oh, this is bad. Fuck. Okay, this is a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be.
[722.81s -> 726.95s]  Did Jerm ever find a party member? Yes, and I told them to leave.
[735.85s -> 742.31s]  Okay, so that- this is much more difficult than- also, I'm also playing on hard. And then some
[742.31s -> 745.91s]  people are like, holy shit, this dude's on like the story mode difficulty and he's losing. No,
[745.91s -> 765.34s]  that's not- that's not what's happening. Let's sneak. Did they hit that scream? All right,
[765.34s -> 778.94s]  we're gonna make it happen. I feel like it's just- the- I don't- the way the guns work sometimes,
[778.94s -> 787.02s]  it just feels like I'm- if I've been playing too much Dusk- all right, I'm gonna drop this- you
[787.02s -> 801.58s]  know what? I've been playing too much Dusk. I'm dead. I have the slow-mo. All right, hold on.
[801.58s -> 813.02s]  The guns in this are mostly lame. Let me look at this shit. What should I even use in here?
[819.72s -> 829.96s]  Uh, do these guys just suck? What about the list I have? Am I not high enough level to kill these
[829.96s -> 842.23s]  guys? What if I put too many points into, uh, lying to people? This thing is probably the best
[842.23s -> 848.62s]  thing I have. No, it's the shotgun and the pistol. This thing actually really is not that good.
[853.75s -> 884.90s]  Let me try this. This, you know, this streamer is whack. Oh, it's not as good. What the fuck
[884.90s -> 899.85s]  are you doing? Where are you going? What is happening right now? What? I gotta combine the-
[903.54s -> 922.81s]  Jesus. Fuck. Dude, does this gun have- does this gun hit people? How- it's a shotgun. What?
[923.53s -> 948.58s]  Does it need to be repaired? How broken is this thing? It's not that broken, is it? Bolter pistol.
[948.58s -> 956.38s]  We'll try this thing. All right, well, this is the first area of the whole game that has been,
[956.38s -> 962.90s]  like, hard for me to even get through it. This thing's almost broken too. Small, lightweight
[962.90s -> 974.65s]  pistol. Just use the light machine gun and just fucking hold the button down. You know what? I
[974.65s -> 981.35s]  have been playing too much Dusk. We're gonna drop the fucking- this by, like, down to, like,
[981.35s -> 1003.80s]  eight percent. I'll do nine percent. No, that's too much. Twelve. All right, that's a little better.
[1004.52s -> 1022.47s]  Now, let me try this. Shotguns are kind of bad. Are they? So it's not just me? The shotgun just,
[1022.47s -> 1051.02s]  like, sucks in this game? All right, let me- let's- let's- let's do this tactically. Holy shit! What
[1051.02s -> 1087.64s]  the fuck? Are these guys, like, level 20? Oh my god, it's precedent. Oh my god. Oh my- okay,
[1087.64s -> 1106.68s]  am I not supposed to be in here? Holy shit. I'm alone, I have no teammates, and they do
[1106.68s -> 1143.85s]  so much damage. What the fuck is going on in this room? What? Give me my- give me this thing.
[1143.85s -> 1156.82s]  It's kind of hard to stealth because I don't know anywhere they're facing, and they- they're- they
[1156.82s -> 1166.94s]  can really- they can see you really easily. All right, there's a guy right here. Is there an
[1166.94s -> 1174.82s]  instant kill? My sneak- I don't have any sneak. I'm a fucking doctor. How do I instantly kill him
[1174.82s -> 1191.58s]  from behind? Give it to me. Where is it? Where is it? Where's the book? Oh my god! Give me, give me,
[1191.58s -> 1212.73s]  give me! No, get it! Pick it up! What is this? Fuck this place. Missed the fish lore? I don't care.
[1212.73s -> 1228.23s]  All right, I got one. Should I get them all? Is this that one person that told me, Jeremy,
[1228.23s -> 1235.82s]  you're gonna hate this because the handguns are terrible? Don't use handguns. Should I have listened
[1235.82s -> 1260.20s]  to the one guy? No, I haven't saved it! I haven't saved the game! Where do I go? Where do I go? Where
[1260.20s -> 1279.11s]  do I go? Okay, I'm at the other one. Save it. I need a workbench. I have to redo this- this guy's
[1279.11s -> 1303.82s]  loadout. What is that? Who's talking? Electric sucks? Why- why does electric suck? Why do- why
[1303.82s -> 1308.54s]  does anything suck? Where's my choice to do what I want to do? What do you mean, it- it sucks?
[1309.50s -> 1321.78s]  Shock and sucks. Shooting sucks. Am I being lied to? How do I get in here, though? Can I break this?
[1322.58s -> 1331.67s]  Yeah, that's- that's very obviously electrified. I guess I can go in here. All right, where's my
[1331.67s -> 1362.81s]  electric? All right, scientist. I thought that was me that died. How is that possible? All right,
[1362.81s -> 1381.98s]  so volume three is way, way easier to get than volume one. It's just right here. Well, not quite,
[1381.98s -> 1391.88s]  but it is still- it's right here. Turn the game volume up? Ah, actually, you're right.
[1391.88s -> 1409.64s]  It should be higher. That's better. What do I have for ammo? Am I good? 1900, it was this light ammo.
[1409.64s -> 1428.26s]  Just buy it. Heavy ammo? Just buy it. Energy cell? Just buy it. Sawed-off shotgun? No. Wait, what?
[1428.26s -> 1447.85s]  Revolver? Should I get this thing? I don't have a revolver. I have a bolt pistol. How much is it?
[1449.80s -> 1457.00s]  And just get it. Whatever. All right, let me look at it. It's all right. All right, let's try it.
[1459.06s -> 1471.64s]  Revolver. Ooh, actually, this is- I like this thing. I'm not even- I actually really like this.
[1472.28s -> 1476.71s]  It's not the best choice, but it's a- it is a choice, so we're gonna use it.
[1479.72s -> 1489.90s]  Exo helmet? I have so much random shit that I need to go to, like, town after I do this. I've
[1489.90s -> 1506.38s]  already read these. I think- I've already been down here. Yeah, I already did all this. This guy's
[1506.38s -> 1526.66s]  friendly. Good thing I cleared this whole thing. Just run down here and get it. Wait, where is it?
[1526.66s -> 1542.41s]  Further down? Okay. Oh, this guy's still down here. Does he care if I take his book? Model spaceship?
[1543.05s -> 1557.30s]  All right, I got two. Don't kill this guy. Why would I kill him? I don't have a reason to kill
[1557.30s -> 1569.38s]  this guy. Not yet, at least. All right, volume two is- should I just fast travel out of here? Can I?
[1570.02s -> 1590.10s]  He doesn't have any morals. Uh, yeah, I do, because I- I didn't kill that guy. If I had no morals,
[1590.10s -> 1599.53s]  I would just be like, hey, watch this chat! That means I have morals. That means I- I chose
[1600.17s -> 1615.06s]  not to shoot that guy. Therefore, I have morals. Is the other one just in here? Wait a minute.
[1615.06s -> 1625.51s]  The other va- no. That's just called not being insane. Yeah, I also said don't smoke cigarettes.
[1625.51s -> 1632.15s]  You weren't here for that. That's pre-stream chat. I said don't vape and don't smoke cigarettes,
[1632.15s -> 1636.90s]  especially don't vape. Because vaping is just cigarettes you can smoke inside.
[1639.48s -> 1646.44s]  And you can just do it a hundred times more than you do cigarettes. And then I went off on a whole
[1646.44s -> 1652.76s]  thing about, uh, you can- all the advertisers are like, it's water vapor. It's clean, clear water.
[1652.76s -> 1658.98s]  Water vapor. But you'll be taking in 50 times more nicotine because you're gonna hit this
[1658.98s -> 1670.12s]  fucking thing all day. But it's vapor. Clean. Clear. Water. Vapor. Turn up the volume, dummy.
[1670.84s -> 1687.00s]  I did. I increased it by like 5,000%. Our branch of vapor juice is the cleanest, clearest water.
[1687.80s -> 1710.31s]  I can only hear gun sounds. Well, what do I- that's called audio design, not me.
[1711.27s -> 1719.80s]  You mean like you can only hear this? Well, how do I fix that? Audio?
[1720.82s -> 1731.19s]  Effects. Music. There's only effects and voice. Turn effects down, turn the master up.
[1743.03s -> 1759.50s]  Okay. Now. Volume 2. Just play Chillstep. Not a bad idea. All right, let's go. Up.
[1760.97s -> 1773.93s]  Wait. No, I went the wrong way. Up. No, go back down. Can I get out of- uh, who let the toddler in
[1773.93s -> 1785.69s]  the elevator? He's just pressing buttons. There you go. Oh, come on. Which one of these is it in?
[1791.40s -> 1818.78s]  All right, I got them all. Can you see me do this? Yeah, whatever. Fucking corporations. Okay,
[1818.78s -> 1843.30s]  let's go back in the elevator and get out of here. Anarchy. That's not anarchy. No mortals. Omega
[1843.30s -> 1852.94s]  low. Omega low-archy? Ornarchy? That's not even- there's no A there. That's not correct.
[1853.82s -> 1858.25s]  You cannot fast-drive well near hostiles. Who's a hostile?
[1858.97s -> 1865.69s]  Is somebody just hanging out one of these buildings? I don't see anybody.
[1877.02s -> 1887.43s]  Am I away from hostiles now? I am. Let's turn this in and then let's tell everybody to leave.
[1892.42s -> 1897.78s]  I did all your tasks. Now go back to Edgewater. We're gonna go take it over.
[1901.03s -> 1901.99s]  I got all three of them.
[1902.71s -> 1907.38s]  No kidding. Really? Well, which one?
[1909.22s -> 1919.11s]  Which one do I give them? Found it in the community center. The elusive part three.
[1919.11s -> 1922.71s]  Someone stashed it away inside the old geomotor. Should I give them the elusive part three?
[1925.24s -> 1931.64s]  The geothermal plant? Now that is just incredible. You really went exploring down there?
[1932.36s -> 1935.96s]  Adelaide always told us it was swarming with hostile mechanicals.
[1936.04s -> 1939.16s]  It was. Until I went down there.
[1948.30s -> 1954.86s]  Hey, it's your lucky day. Hold on. I got more for you. I got another one. Here, take part two.
[1966.22s -> 1977.64s]  Oh, almost forgot your payment. What was it? You gained 500 bits. Thanks for the five dollars.
[1978.20s -> 1984.33s]  Last one. Don't keep me in suspense. Look at that. So what do you get for all three? Building
[1984.33s -> 1990.81s]  a computing machine out of spectrum potatoes, a primer. I'm just glad it survived all these years.
[1991.77s -> 1998.73s]  That's a complete set. All three parts. I'm gonna be the greatest engineer Halcyon's ever seen.
[1999.29s -> 2003.21s]  4,000 experience. I've been saving something for you. Just a little contraption.
[2004.41s -> 2011.83s]  Should fit right into your outfit. What is it? What is it? Hurry up. Electrocharged surface.
[2012.71s -> 2019.70s]  I want to ask you something. Go back a couple months to Edgewater. This camp's my home.
[2020.26s -> 2026.57s]  People you see milling about? They're my family. At least I think of them that way. I owe them my
[2026.57s -> 2031.69s]  life. Would have died in the wilderness if they hadn't chanced upon me. Starving and delirious.
[2031.69s -> 2035.85s]  All right, so now I've done everything. All right, well cool. You can tell somebody else.
[2036.57s -> 2042.79s]  All right, I've done it. So now comes now the power. Return to Adelaide. Reed has been removed
[2042.79s -> 2055.10s]  from Edgewater. Return to Adelaide and tell her the news. So we're ready to kill Adelaide.
[2055.66s -> 2063.98s]  I know, but that's like anarchy. I don't think I'm gonna do that. Let's hold on. Let me see what
[2063.98s -> 2072.12s]  happens. The plan was to bring everybody back to Edgewater and then kill her. But then wouldn't I
[2072.12s -> 2081.51s]  just be everybody? I would be just enemy number one. Let's see. Look at that. The snakes come back.
[2082.79s -> 2088.02s]  Call me a snake again. Reed's dead. Come back to Edgewater.
[2088.18s -> 2095.30s]  You have a peculiar comfort with violence. Killing off my garden, gunning down Reed Thompson.
[2096.42s -> 2103.06s]  Suppose it's time our flock made our way back to Edgewater. We must tend to what remains of the
[2103.06s -> 2109.06s]  town and carry on with our lives as best we may. So who runs the town now? You're vexing to me,
[2109.06s -> 2116.34s]  you know. Injuring us with one hand, helping us with the other. Here, I'm giving you something
[2116.34s -> 2124.31s]  to leave us be. It's a ransom, you understand, not a reward. Ransom? You just gave me you a watch
[2124.31s -> 2132.71s]  for ransom for you? You know, it's better off with you running the place. You're telling me you did
[2132.71s -> 2139.45s]  all this just to put me in charge of Edgewater? Stranger, you are some kind of twisted. You might
[2139.45s -> 2144.81s]  turn that old cannery into a garden. I'm gonna wait till she sits down in the throne and then
[2144.89s -> 2149.37s]  kill her. I need some time to gather my personals. Long walk back to Edgewater.
[2150.33s -> 2153.77s]  Got a considerable burden to carry. And then hopefully somebody else is ready. You're like,
[2153.77s -> 2159.86s]  oh wait, I could run the place. Yeah, I bet you could. Why don't you give it a try?
[2161.78s -> 2172.49s]  Sitting in the mayor chair is the trigger for me to shoot them. Take care now. I'll see you later.
[2173.13s -> 2188.01s]  There can be no ruler. Everyone who tries gets the boot. I just spilled coffee all over my
[2188.01s -> 2194.01s]  fucking whole body. Whatever. I'm not moving. All right, so we got, they're making their way
[2194.01s -> 2214.49s]  back to Edgewater. Now get the power regulator. Give it to me. What would happen? I don't even
[2214.49s -> 2265.62s]  know. Regulator, return to the unreliable. I did it. Let's go. So that's it. All right, we're good.
[2266.57s -> 2272.30s]  She's still alive, right? Okay. I told you, I do what I do appreciate about this game.
[2272.30s -> 2276.78s]  You can say it might be a little more limited, whatever, right? But one really important thing
[2276.78s -> 2284.71s]  to remember about this game is most NPCs die in one hit. Remember when you used to play Fallout
[2284.71s -> 2294.33s]  and you'd fight an NPC and all of a sudden it would just be like a boss fight? People die pretty
[2294.33s -> 2310.97s]  quick. Okay, so now I got to go back to the landing site. Let's continue. Bastard. Bastard.
[2311.77s -> 2328.31s]  Look at him go. Bastard. All right, let's do it. Well, I certainly am looking forward to flying
[2328.31s -> 2343.93s]  on a ship. Is this a hologram? This is a projection. He's not actually here. He's like,
[2345.35s -> 2355.53s]  spoiler for a very large movie franchise. Is that, that's not going to like come back and bite me
[2355.53s -> 2360.86s]  in the ass or later, right? Like in an hour, he's not going to instantly take all that stored up
[2360.86s -> 2370.55s]  damage and die, right? Like he's not gonna be mad at me or something. Okay. Well, we got,
[2370.55s -> 2377.11s]  we got backs. We're good. Captain, I have detected that Edgewater's power supply is now optimal.
[2377.67s -> 2381.27s]  I applaud your willingness to invest your time in the local community.
[2383.03s -> 2386.47s]  What can I do for you? I've got your power core. We can get out of here.
[2387.03s -> 2394.39s]  Do you know how to install a power regulator? No idea. Yes, I do. Outstanding, Captain. Your
[2394.39s -> 2399.59s]  aptitude for engineering will prove invaluable in the event of another catastrophic engine failure.
[2400.23s -> 2405.51s]  Our engine room is located behind you, across the cargo bay, up the ladders.
[2416.41s -> 2424.09s]  Dumb engineer, dumb doctor, dumb everything. Dumb liar. But you can't be all of these things
[2424.09s -> 2429.61s]  if you're stupid. It doesn't make any sense. If you pick the dumb trait, then you shouldn't be
[2429.61s -> 2444.23s]  able to be like a scientist or a doctor. It's a living oxymoron. All right. How did I pass
[2444.23s -> 2450.57s]  medical school if I can't even like read? That makes no sense. If I can't read, how did you pass
[2450.57s -> 2458.46s]  med school? What can I do for you, Captain? All right. So all systems are operating within
[2458.46s -> 2465.18s]  acceptable parameters to bring the unreliable into low altitude orbit. This should prove an
[2465.18s -> 2474.39s]  adequate test of our flight capabilities. Hold on. Do I need to clean something up here? Let's see.
[2474.39s -> 2481.16s]  Side quest. Retrieve the cache of medicine. Abernathy believes he's dying. Well, I already
[2481.16s -> 2492.79s]  didn't already kill him. I mean, I already, I'm pretty sure I already sentenced him to death.
[2493.43s -> 2502.89s]  Yeah, let's go. He's dead. I like told on him and shit and like the guard now knows everything about
[2502.89s -> 2510.44s]  it. Back to the community center. No, no, he's dead. Welcome back, Captain. Can't save her. All
[2510.44s -> 2515.80s]  systems are now operating within acceptable parameters. I know. Not like I've been trying
[2515.80s -> 2523.83s]  to save anybody. Can't save everybody. Just accidentally killed like four people and destroyed
[2523.83s -> 2553.93s]  a whole town. Whatever. Can't save everybody. Request from Dr. Phineas Wells. Pogchamp's in
[2554.09s -> 2561.85s]  chat over that. It's just like a ship taking off. I love that so much.
[2568.66s -> 2574.90s]  Hail and hearty and captain of your own ship. I see you're putting the unreliable to good use.
[2574.90s -> 2579.48s]  Shame about her former captain. Horrible way to die. How are you feeling by the way?
[2579.48s -> 2584.84s]  Do you look like that guy that's in the basement of the geothermal plant? Any unnatural drippage?
[2584.84s -> 2592.65s]  Perfectly normal side effect of thawing. I assure you. All right. I'll get to the point. What you
[2592.65s -> 2598.49s]  saw in Emerald Vale is happening all across the colony. Food shortages, lack of supplies,
[2598.49s -> 2604.57s]  and basic necessities. We're dying. The chairman, the minister, and all their lackeys on the board
[2604.57s -> 2610.57s]  are to blame. The hope has some of the brightest minds earth ever sent us. If we can revive the
[2610.57s -> 2616.49s]  hope's colonists, they can help us undo the board's mistakes. They can help us set things right.
[2617.61s -> 2622.01s]  You need to get to Stellar Bay on Monarch. I have contacts there. They'll help me,
[2622.73s -> 2628.25s]  help us find the chemicals to revive your fellow colonists. I really give you this quiet. You're
[2628.25s -> 2632.81s]  doing that face too. That's what you're doing. Cozy little black marketing outfit on the ground
[2632.81s -> 2637.85s]  breaker. She can get you a nav key to land on Stellar Bay. Okay. You cannot travel to Phineas's
[2637.85s -> 2644.49s]  lab. Okay. I'll go have a word with Gladys. Why do I need a nav key to land on a planet? Slow down.
[2644.49s -> 2648.97s]  You're asking me to get involved with the black market. Or I could put a couple light years between
[2648.97s -> 2662.09s]  me and... I could just leave. I'll go have a word. Excellent. I'll send her a wireless. Let her know
[2662.09s -> 2669.94s]  you're coming. By the way, I gave Captain Hawthorne a disguise apparatus of my own design. Cutting edge
[2669.94s -> 2676.98s]  technology years ahead of its time. I call it the holographic shroud. I'm sure it will prove
[2676.98s -> 2682.42s]  remarkably useful to you. You'll find it in the captain's quarters. Wait, I can put on a disguise?
[2683.86s -> 2688.95s]  You want me to wear a cape? Wrong matter of shroud, my slow-witted accomplice. This is,
[2688.95s -> 2697.11s]  how to put it, simply a device that makes you look different, sound different, briefly. The device has
[2697.11s -> 2702.39s]  its limits, but it will allow you to blend in perfectly and probably won't jeopardize your
[2702.39s -> 2710.23s]  ability to have children. Will it? No, definitely not. Probably. Yes. Very simply, the holographic
[2710.23s -> 2715.83s]  shroud uses biometric information contained on standard identity cartridges to generate a
[2715.83s -> 2723.03s]  holographic projection around you. Okay. What are the limitations? It only stands up to a
[2723.03s -> 2728.63s]  casual scrutiny. Use it too long, bound to flicker, blur, something like that. Movement
[2728.63s -> 2735.03s]  makes it more likely. Movement? Best used in moderation. When you see guards in your path,
[2735.03s -> 2740.47s]  you can sneak past your target. Oh, this is going to be horrible. Maintain your distance. Act normal.
[2740.47s -> 2745.35s]  No running, no jumping. No running, no jumping? Don't draw their attention. If they pay attention,
[2745.35s -> 2749.03s]  they're more likely to notice flaws in the hologram. What do you mean, I can't run?
[2749.03s -> 2760.26s]  Change of clothes. What is this? Some old spy serial? What inattentive and brainless
[2760.26s -> 2768.18s]  guard would be fooled by such a shabby disguise? The holographic shroud masks not only your clothes,
[2768.18s -> 2772.74s]  but your face and fingerprints. It modulates your voice and sweetens your breath.
[2774.82s -> 2779.78s]  Okay, I'll put it to good use. Excellent. I'll contact you once you've found a way to get to
[2779.78s -> 2787.38s]  Stellar Bay. If you have any questions, come see me in my lab. And remember, don't trust the board.
[2787.38s -> 2792.98s]  They'll try to win you over with promises of wealth and power, but it's a lie. Is it? I know
[2792.98s -> 2796.18s]  that very well. The board is only interested in filling their own pockets. If we don't put a stop
[2796.18s -> 2801.06s]  to them, they're going to run this colony to the ground. Liars versus liars. Transmission ended.
[2801.06s -> 2805.78s]  If you are ready to depart, please select a destination on your navigation terminal.
[2806.34s -> 2824.94s]  Got it. Okay, so can I just open the hatch and just fly out? I don't know why I even asked that question.
[2824.94s -> 2832.09s]  All right, holographic shroud. There it is. Projects a disguise on you and your companions
[2832.09s -> 2836.81s]  that gives you access to restricted areas provided you have the correct ID cartridge for that area.
[2837.53s -> 2841.45s]  Restricted areas are off limits to unauthorized personnel and otherwise result in being attacked
[2841.45s -> 2855.78s]  on sight. Well, that sucks. Reeds. Did I bring Reed's skull? Did I take this guy's head?
[2863.58s -> 2872.92s]  What the hell? That's a little fucked up. All right, what do I got? A bin. Let me see. I need
[2872.92s -> 2899.29s]  a workbench. Where's the nearest workbench? Shh! Who's this? Sam. Okay. Workbench. Am I stealing?
[2900.09s -> 2915.48s]  This is not like somebody else's room, right? A stern older man with warm eyes.
[2921.42s -> 2933.34s]  There he is. Tarot cards? Tarot cards. Okay. Don't want to see the Ten of Swords.
[2933.90s -> 2951.03s]  Especially when it's the right way up. That's real. But that's real. You guys can mine us
[2951.03s -> 2954.55s]  to all you want. That's actually real if you see the Ten of Swords in a reading.
[2954.71s -> 2969.50s]  What? None of you guys understand tarot readings? I bet you there are 20, almost 2600 people here.
[2969.50s -> 2974.94s]  I bet you maybe one or two of you have ever had a reading. I've never had a reading before.
[2975.50s -> 2981.59s]  Has anybody in here actually done it? Maybe four of you? So that, that like reference was for four
[2981.59s -> 2994.95s]  of you. What? You guys don't like sit on the toilet and like read about tarot cards? It's what? Just
[2994.95s -> 2997.75s]  because you're just like, oh, I wonder what that's all about. And you just read about it?
[3005.75s -> 3013.08s]  I do that, but not, no, I must, I must be a fucking hundred years old. You guys don't read
[3013.08s -> 3030.34s]  shit on the toilet? What? Oh, you go on Twitter. Oh, right. You scroll through Twitter. Oh, I forgot.
[3030.34s -> 3048.63s]  I forgot about social media. God. You guys should be reading about tarot cards and like,
[3049.19s -> 3054.66s]  how much water pressure happens when you go a mile underwater? You don't read that?
[3055.30s -> 3069.22s]  I don't understand why. All right, let's go to, this is where I am, uh, terror two. I can go
[3069.22s -> 3074.41s]  a lot of different places, can't I? This is a whole solar system. This is awesome. Welcome to
[3074.41s -> 3078.01s]  the system map here. You can see all the planets in the system as well as some special points of
[3078.01s -> 3082.38s]  interest. You can fly your ship to any location you've unlocked. There's some landing bays require
[3082.38s -> 3088.09s]  special codes and keys before they allow you to land. Moving between planets is considered
[3088.41s -> 3096.25s]  dangerous. Okay. All right. Passage to anywhere. Uh, speak to Gladys on the ground breaker.
[3104.90s -> 3117.50s]  Ground breaker. Let's go. We've arrived at the ground breaker. So I have it a bit beamed onto
[3117.50s -> 3134.17s]  their ship. First of all, let me do this. All right, we need to do done. Okay. So now I am
[3134.17s -> 3145.98s]  impossible to, I'm, I'm a dialogue master. Get some new clothes. I will hold on. I'm a 50 liar
[3146.70s -> 3156.54s]  perks. What do I got? Journal. Ooh. All right. Uh, you have a sawed off shotgun and a scope.
[3157.34s -> 3163.32s]  That doesn't look right in your hands. It seems weird. Uh, I'm going to give you this.
[3164.28s -> 3171.70s]  That's probably better use for you. Hey, don't aim that at me. What the fuck?
[3172.58s -> 3182.28s]  You stupid. All right. Uh, let's go back. Captain, could I have a moment of your time?
[3182.28s -> 3190.17s]  You sure could by Verity, by strength. What are we contemplating today? All right. We have to go
[3190.17s -> 3194.66s]  back and forth here with Max. I'd like to know something about those I'm flying with. What's
[3194.66s -> 3200.49s]  your story? I'm the, you're the only one on the ship. Any ideas where we can find someone who
[3200.49s -> 3205.21s]  speaks French in this colony? I've been thinking on that. There's a form. That's what we care about.
[3205.93s -> 3211.53s]  Infamous philosopher scholar who fled terror to some years ago. He's an expert on Bacono.
[3212.25s -> 3217.37s]  He's also who told me of the journal's presence in Emerald Vale. If anyone in this colony could
[3217.37s -> 3225.37s]  translate that book, it would be him. Seriously? The one guy in this whole colony? The only one
[3225.37s -> 3232.09s]  I'm aware of. I suppose we could always just ask for random passersby if they are. Talk to computer.
[3232.09s -> 3239.18s]  Get Sam. Talk to computer. No, I want this guy. Your sarcasm is duly noted and it will be reflected
[3239.18s -> 3245.02s]  on your review. A thousand pardons, my good captain. I thought we were engaging in witty repartee.
[3245.82s -> 3253.90s]  Now, we want Sam and Max. We should start on the ground breaker. Yeah, they're in the game.
[3253.90s -> 3259.66s]  They're the only two people that are going to be on my ship. Are you going to have two at once?
[3259.66s -> 3264.54s]  All I need is access to a data cartridge from the security. Hold on. I can have Sam and Max.
[3265.50s -> 3267.58s]  What? Let's do it.
[3272.95s -> 3276.63s]  All right, how will the crew manifest to help us to track down your scholar friend?
[3276.63s -> 3279.99s]  I'll comb the last six months of departure manifest to track the
[3279.99s -> 3290.09s]  Philosophist's off-world destination. Okay. Thank you, captain. All right, let's get Sam.
[3295.48s -> 3300.38s]  I would like you. You know anything about the auto-mechanical gathering dust in the
[3300.46s -> 3305.26s]  janitor closet? The intent is a cleaning, Sam. Hawthorne brought it on board some cycles ago.
[3305.26s -> 3309.10s]  I'm sure with the intent to modify it, but I've never seen it up and running.
[3309.74s -> 3313.98s]  Alex likely recorded progress notes detailing his efforts to modify Sam.
[3314.70s -> 3318.94s]  If you check the terminal in your captain's quarters, we may be able to determine what
[3318.94s -> 3323.10s]  work remains in order for Sam to properly operate. Another quest to get Sam and Max.
[3323.66s -> 3327.74s]  Uh, okay. I'm in the mood for some entertainment.
[3327.74s -> 3330.30s]  Certainly, captain. What would you like to hear?
[3334.14s -> 3339.02s]  Tell me a joke. I used to hate math, but then I realized decimals have a point.
[3343.72s -> 3346.76s]  Now playing a Spacer's Choice advertisement jingle.
[3347.48s -> 3356.12s]  It's not the best choice. That's not my favorite song. Everyone in Halcyon
[3356.12s -> 3361.32s]  is contractually obligated to label this or another board-certified jingle their favorite song.
[3362.20s -> 3365.32s]  Let me let me fucking fix. Let me fix that up for you.
[3365.32s -> 3368.36s]  Now playing a Spacer's Choice advertisement jingle.
[3369.72s -> 3381.69s]  Oh, beatbox. You beatbox. Oh, beatbox. You beatbox. My pleasure, captain. As you wish,
[3381.69s -> 3390.41s]  captain. I must comply with all direct orders. All right, let's go. I'll be here.
[3391.21s -> 3399.67s]  All right, now let me look. Uh, the empty man.
[3400.55s -> 3406.06s]  The cleaning machine. All right, search Hawthorne's terminal. Let's figure it out.
[3410.84s -> 3420.76s]  This is my favorite room. It's so spacious. Cool. All right. Good to know. All right, let's repair.
[3421.72s -> 3434.73s]  What is this? A revolver? Yeah, this is a shock pistol. Yeah, I still don't need it. How's this
[3434.73s -> 3445.98s]  doing? It's fine. How's this doing? It's all right. This needs to be repaired. Yeah. Okay.
[3448.07s -> 3452.71s]  Why does it have a diamond on it? Hunting rifle. What's that? What's that diamond mean?
[3455.66s -> 3463.14s]  Tinker. Let's see. I want to make this a little better. Revolver damage. Is it stupid for me to?
[3463.94s -> 3484.60s]  I mean, it's only $50. That's not that. It's 102 bucks. 110. Do it again.
[3485.24s -> 3493.13s]  I want to make this useful one more time. Okay. That's it. That's it. That's not again. Now we're
[3493.13s -> 3502.54s]  getting, we're getting to $600. 128 DPS for the pistol is pretty damn good. All right. Tinker
[3503.10s -> 3515.58s]  with the hunting rifle. 58 DPS. 100. No, what else can I do? My light machine gun.
[3516.68s -> 3519.80s]  Always just do at least the first or second tier of these because why not?
[3520.44s -> 3529.00s]  This thing's going to be useful now. All right, now let's break this shit down.
[3530.46s -> 3536.54s]  Uh, keep the shovel. Get rid of the, this guy's staff. All right. What is it? No, not Tinker.
[3536.54s -> 3545.26s]  We modified. No, we need to break down. Okay. Break this down. Uh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
[3545.26s -> 3552.63s]  This is okay. That's not equipped, right? I just destroyed something that was a diamond on it.
[3552.63s -> 3563.35s]  Oops. Who cares? Uh, this is too one-handed. Um, this thing is just worse. This is both one-handed.
[3563.35s -> 3572.39s]  No, it's not. Uh, fuck it. Who cares? Oh shit. All right. I need to modify, modify, modify. What
[3572.39s -> 3579.03s]  can we do with this? With the revolver? No modifications I have for the, um, for the revolver.
[3579.75s -> 3592.65s]  No scopes. No nothing. How? Light machine gun. Nothing. The pistol. Nothing. What about armor?
[3593.21s -> 3606.07s]  There we go. Electro charge surface. Thug kit. All right. Let me look at what I even have for it.
[3606.07s -> 3613.02s]  I have a lot of ram shit here. This thing is tech skills. It's five armor. What else do I have?
[3613.98s -> 3630.55s]  Lab outfit. I kind of like it. I do kind of like it. Patched low pressure helmet. Mining gear is
[3630.55s -> 3644.02s]  stealth. No. Holy shit. 17 armor. It's heavy armor though. It weighs a lot. No, it doesn't. Spacer's
[3644.02s -> 3651.10s]  choice outfit. Melee weapon skills. Sneak. One-handed melee plus five. That's actually
[3651.10s -> 3660.28s]  pretty good, but I'm going to keep this on. I like this weird doctor look. Yeah, that looks
[3660.28s -> 3673.94s]  all right. Wear the hat. Oh yeah. Dialogue skill plus seven. That's true. All right. What do you,
[3673.94s -> 3686.52s]  what do you got on for armor? This. Give me this. I'm putting that on. Your clothes. Give them to me.
[3687.24s -> 3701.32s]  All right. Now you can put on the doctor outfit. Let's just trade. All right. We're going to trade.
[3701.32s -> 3712.41s]  You're going to be me and I'm going to be you. You get to be the doctor. I get to be the priest.
[3712.41s -> 3721.61s]  Do we have two hats? I think that's fine. This is where I have to actually pay attention. So
[3722.33s -> 3729.59s]  this is the heal. Heals 25% health over two seconds. Plus 200% natural health regeneration
[3729.59s -> 3740.89s]  for two minutes. So I can combine these. That's pretty cool. Let's do, what do I have a lot of?
[3741.53s -> 3747.82s]  That's like headshot damage. Can I just do two of these? Can I do like a double dose?
[3753.75s -> 3768.38s]  Well, let's do the, let's do this for now. Do matching hats. Fine. You have perks though. All
[3768.38s -> 3778.50s]  right. Base health threat generated. Increase your hack skill. I don't want to generate that much
[3778.50s -> 3793.90s]  threat. Maybe the hack skill, but I'm not going to really use it. I mean, it is, it is just a free
[3793.90s -> 3814.02s]  hack skill. That's true for health or it's either health or hack. Cause I don't want you to generate
[3814.02s -> 3820.41s]  threat. You'll just die instantly, but I don't want you to not generate threat. Cause I don't
[3820.41s -> 3829.80s]  want to take all the hits, but we're going to get Sam. It's a free hack skill. I'm taking it
[3832.90s -> 3841.42s]  plus 20% dialogue, combat effective, melee damage, armor rating, range damage, free hack skill.
[3845.03s -> 3850.97s]  All right. Looking good. I've got my stuff sorted. Let me just go to my weapons, make sure this is
[3850.97s -> 3856.18s]  all correct. Where's my revolver? There it is. This is the one that I'm going to use. I've upgraded
[3856.18s -> 3864.17s]  this a lot. This thing's all right. This thing's okay. They're all all right. All right. Looking
[3864.17s -> 3875.78s]  good. Got my, can I up, can you tinker your armor? Can I upgrade the armor? Shit, I can. Okay. So
[3875.78s -> 3891.58s]  I'm going to upgrade his robes. All right. And upgrade the hat too. One more time. Why,
[3891.58s -> 3904.97s]  why did that not go up? All right. I'm going to break down the, one of these, probably the
[3904.97s -> 3911.22s]  shock one. No, this one. Do I even want the assault rifle? No, fuck it. I don't want it.
[3912.82s -> 3919.61s]  What about this junk mining gear? I feel like I could use this, but I don't want to be weighed
[3919.61s -> 3930.26s]  down. Tech skills. No, this is worker's outfit, melee weapon skills. I mean, I don't care.
[3930.26s -> 3939.43s]  Oh, sneak plus five. I'm never going to be sneaking around. One-handed melee, maybe mining gear. I'm
[3939.43s -> 3946.34s]  not going to be sneaking around. This thing is a diamond, so I'm not going to get rid of it.
[3946.34s -> 3951.85s]  Stealth skills, get rid of the damn thing. Tech skills, maybe, but not really. Get rid of the
[3951.85s -> 3964.63s]  damn thing. I'm being weighed down by, all right, that's fine. All right. I'm ready. Let's do this.
[3965.27s -> 3982.12s]  What was I doing? I forget. I was going to go over here. Yeah. To do, to activate Sam. Search term
[3982.12s -> 3988.04s]  Sam. First Sam result. Do not forget you found a discarded sanitation and maintenance auto-mechanical
[3988.04s -> 3992.52s]  in Emerald Vale scrap heap during your last job. It should not be too difficult to get it up and
[3992.52s -> 3997.40s]  running with a few key modifications. I can envision a combat capable variant. Some might
[3997.40s -> 4004.60s]  say a clean, mean killing machine should be fun. Removal of factory standard part. Suds steeper
[4004.60s -> 4008.52s]  with successful delivery of combat modified replacement part. Acid steeper has been deployed.
[4009.32s -> 4013.24s]  Progress setback is estimated to be a solid three months. Not like I have more pressing
[4013.24s -> 4020.38s]  matters to attend to, but I do. I'm giving up hope on the delivery. The part is lost in transit. It's
[4020.38s -> 4025.66s]  not turning up anytime soon, but good news. I heard from a fellow who knows a gal who knows
[4025.66s -> 4030.22s]  the broker who overcharged me for the information regarding the location of an acid steeper. I can
[4031.66s -> 4037.58s]  filch. The part was sent to an old storage facility in Rose Way. The rest of the stuff
[4038.54s -> 4041.50s]  you could have just went like this and hit delete because that's all I need to know.
[4042.70s -> 4054.95s]  It's abandoned. Good. Cleaning machine. Let's get it. Find the acid steeper. Let's do that.
[4055.43s -> 4062.14s]  I'm into that right now. I want two companions. That just freaked me out. I forgot you're the
[4062.14s -> 4067.16s]  doctor now and I'm the priest. So I'm going to make sure you have all the medical stuff.
[4073.53s -> 4079.94s]  Okay, where is this thing? You found entries on Hawthorne's term in the captain's quarters
[4079.94s -> 4083.38s]  regarding his attempts to turn Simon over. Hawthorne planned to replace him with an acid
[4083.38s -> 4090.58s]  steeper but never picked up the part from Rose Way. Welcome back captain. Where's Rose Way? How
[4090.58s -> 4098.73s]  can I be of assistance? Goodbye. I don't have access to Rose Way yet, huh?
[4102.17s -> 4109.75s]  Well, shit. Okay. So Rose Way is not accessible so we can't do that yet. So we're just going to go to
[4111.19s -> 4121.66s]  where we were going before. The ground breaker has approved our request for docking captain.
[4121.66s -> 4142.81s]  Oh, all right. Okay. Let's have a meeting. Party select. Just you. It's just you. So right now
[4142.81s -> 4149.58s]  this actor is reading the script for what's coming up. He's not happy about it. He's like,
[4149.58s -> 4153.90s]  wait, they made changes? I have to be the fucking doctor now? Oh, that seems a little...
[4154.70s -> 4161.56s]  Well, you're the director, I guess. Okay. I thought I was hired to be the priest.
[4169.27s -> 4178.73s]  All right, let's go. Smells like grease and unwashed bodies. Just as I remembered. That's
[4178.73s -> 4184.55s]  not the point. This hat would just knock out one of my workers. Yeah, with a tossball stick. I heard
[4184.55s -> 4190.47s]  you the first time. There weren't any witnesses. No witnesses. He's not even denying it. No
[4190.47s -> 4197.03s]  witnesses. Jackass had it coming. Sorry. Shut it, Felix. Hi, I am interrupting you. If you could
[4197.03s -> 4202.41s]  move along, I'd be obliged. Don't go telling him where to step. Ground breaker belongs to all of
[4202.41s -> 4210.01s]  us. Felix, first of all, no, it doesn't. And second, shut the hell up. Don't think I won't detain you
[4210.01s -> 4216.89s]  again. Are you head backwards? Does this head 180 degrees turn like broken neck?
[4217.85s -> 4224.57s]  You look like you got enough problems. Mind if I have a word with the kid? Hey, knock yourself
[4224.57s -> 4234.39s]  out. Or him, if you're so inclined. Whatever you heard, it's all true. I heard you, I heard you
[4234.39s -> 4237.51s]  knock somebody out with a tossball stick. The guy insulted my Rizzo's Rangers, all right?
[4238.31s -> 4242.95s]  You can't just insult my Rangers and expect to get away with it. What's Rizzo's Rangers? So of
[4242.95s -> 4247.43s]  course I decked him with a tossball stick. I mean, what am I? What kind of fairweather fan?
[4247.43s -> 4254.41s]  Did he make fun of your Pokemon card deck choices? So you hit him with a stick? That's overreaction.
[4254.41s -> 4259.05s]  You wouldn't be saying that if you'd been there. Guy never liked me. Always trying to get a rise
[4259.05s -> 4264.97s]  out of me. But I keep my chin up, right? Be the bigger man, I tell myself. He's a Spacer's chosen
[4264.97s -> 4270.57s]  man, though. So when the chosen beat my Rangers the other night, my foreman comes swaggering up
[4270.57s -> 4278.49s]  with his head full of boasting. Oh boy. Oh, and that's when you resolve your differences like
[4278.49s -> 4284.57s]  an adult, right? That's when I broadsided him with a tossball stick. Yeah. Look, this was a long time
[4284.57s -> 4289.29s]  coming. Guy thinks he can push me around because he's some sky-high foreman and I'm just a back
[4289.29s -> 4300.14s]  base dock worker. Well, former dock worker. Guess I just tendered my resignation. You're lucky you're
[4300.14s -> 4304.94s]  not serving a sentence. You know something? I am lucky. I ought to raise a glass of zero G to my
[4304.94s -> 4311.10s]  fortune if I had the bits. Hey, not for nothing. But I saw you wander out of that ship over there
[4311.10s -> 4315.26s]  by the dock. Wouldn't happen to be yours, would it? What does my ship have to do with you?
[4320.26s -> 4324.74s]  That's me, captain of the unreliable. Captain of the unreliable. You're like something out of a
[4324.74s -> 4329.30s]  serial drama. Hey, I don't want to tuck your ears off guessing you got places to be. I appreciate
[4329.30s -> 4337.85s]  your time. Please don't hit me with a stick. Oh, not at all. Just, uh, you know, gonna figure out
[4337.85s -> 4346.26s]  what to do next. See you around, boss. Boss. Hey, what are you, what are you making this guy?
[4346.98s -> 4351.70s]  I find myself marveling at the complex simplicity of the Fibonacci spiral.
[4351.70s -> 4358.76s]  I'm sure you know what that's like. Something that he's gone. Let's talk about the thing,
[4358.76s -> 4363.48s]  you know, that thing with the thing that you want to do. Yes. Well, now that we're here,
[4363.48s -> 4366.60s]  can we check in with security? I'd like to track down that scholar.
[4368.63s -> 4376.42s]  That's the plan. Okay. All right, let's have the conversation with the lattice.
[4378.30s -> 4385.29s]  Customs and inspection, right this way. Identification, please. Oh, do I have,
[4385.29s -> 4395.03s]  wait, I don't have the, do I have the thing on? I don't think I turned on the cloaking device.
[4396.31s -> 4400.55s]  You're guarding the door. I'll call you guard. You're welcome. That's only about the third or
[4400.55s -> 4405.67s]  fourth dumbest line I've heard all day. I give it a six out of ten. Seems a little high.
[4406.07s -> 4411.19s]  That was barely a three in my humble opinion. I was being generous for the sake of his pride.
[4411.91s -> 4424.06s]  So identification. You guys don't like this guy? How could you guys not like Max? Here. Captain
[4424.70s -> 4430.62s]  Hawthorne, you said. Let me apologize in advance. I'm about to ruin your day. According to your
[4430.62s -> 4435.26s]  ship's record, you've been flagged by the board. Your ship will be impounded until such a time as
[4435.26s -> 4440.94s]  they see fit. Well, isn't this wonderful? The captain's done something to get on the board's
[4440.94s -> 4450.90s]  bad side. Now hold on. This isn't the end of the world. Probably. Uh, I take it back. I'm not
[4450.90s -> 4457.38s]  Hawthorne and that's not my ship. Oh, thank the law. I could use a diversion. Tell me more then.
[4457.38s -> 4463.86s]  Really sell it to me. It's not mine. Uh, well, I won the ship in a poker game. Hawthorne gave me
[4463.86s -> 4468.58s]  his ID so I could fly it. Hawthorne died in a crash. I took his ID so I could fly his ship.
[4468.58s -> 4472.82s]  Captain Hawthorne abducted me and made me work for his ship for free. I'm a prisoner. Help.
[4472.82s -> 4479.85s]  I like where this is headed. What happened to this uh vile kidnapper? I killed him. You must
[4479.85s -> 4491.46s]  feel terrific. Good for you. So I'm stuck here? Not stuck per se. You can always throw yourself
[4491.46s -> 4496.50s]  out the airlock. Of course then you find yourself with an exciting new problem. I'm on a secret
[4496.50s -> 4502.18s]  mission. Uh, I take it this happens a lot. Just the opposite. The board knows we don't take kindly
[4502.18s -> 4508.10s]  to their interfering in our operations here. Surely this must be some sort of mix-up. I had
[4508.10s -> 4514.82s]  to take a guess as to why. You probably riled up the wrong petty board bureaucrat. A man named Udom
[4514.82s -> 4525.06s]  Bedford. Okay, so kill. Kill Bedford. I'm gonna wring this Bedford guy's neck. You take the
[4525.06s -> 4530.34s]  starch out of him. Well, you won't hear any complaints from me. Imagine admitting to like
[4530.34s -> 4538.33s]  the guard. I'm gonna do you a favor. Sure. Wand the door set over in sick day. Tell her the shipment's
[4538.33s -> 4543.21s]  not in yet. It's not coming in anytime soon and if she'd be so obliged to get off my ass about it.
[4543.77s -> 4547.56s]  So if I do you this favor you're not going to talk about how I killed the guy that I just
[4547.56s -> 4553.58s]  told you I was going to go kill. Good. Got it. Much appreciated. Is there anything else I can help you
[4553.58s -> 4561.24s]  with? I'm looking for Gladys. The fence. You'll find her and the rest and go on your left when
[4561.24s -> 4570.23s]  you enter the promenade. Make sure you bring an empty belly. What can you tell me about Bedford?
[4570.23s -> 4574.63s]  Friendly enough unless you speak ill of the board. Get the sense he doesn't care for groundbreaker
[4574.63s -> 4581.93s]  much. Not that he would being a board man and all. He's our liaison. Sounds like a fun guy.
[4585.03s -> 4590.15s]  Really likes his cereals too. Maybe a little too much. Bit of a weird bird all told.
[4590.95s -> 4601.67s]  Okay. See you around. Be seeing you. Understood. I'll keep my head down.
[4611.83s -> 4621.16s]  Through the hole in the glass. You thought that wasn't going to save you.
[4622.12s -> 4627.32s]  Doesn't seem to care though. All right let's go uh let's go talk to and I'm putting my hands in
[4627.32s -> 4633.94s]  the air and going talk to Bedford. A quest objective requires you to enter a restricted
[4633.94s -> 4637.86s]  area. If caught inside you'll be shot on sight. Using a disguise will prevent immediate hostilities.
[4638.74s -> 4643.08s]  Security I can check the departure's register to find out which crew check
[4643.08s -> 4649.98s]  I mean the scholar shipped in and out with. What are you looking at?
[4649.98s -> 4657.64s]  What do you think? What do you think would dress funny? You think this is funny?
[4661.03s -> 4664.31s]  Doctor and a scientist? What do you think? I don't understand. What's wrong?
[4666.18s -> 4678.95s]  Hey. Let's go Max. I picked up this weird signal the other day. It was coming from Monarch.
[4680.12s -> 4684.76s]  Here we go again. No one lives on Monarch. Well like you never seen a doctor walk into a ship
[4684.76s -> 4688.52s]  before? Never seen a doctor and a scientist walk into a ship? What's this for? What's going on
[4688.52s -> 4696.84s]  with your eyes? Oh don't even look at his face. Okay I'm not gonna kill somebody.
[4700.36s -> 4704.04s]  Okay okay okay okay. Wait restricted area. How do I turn on the disguise?
[4706.42s -> 4723.24s]  Who's talking to us? Is this restricted? Is there do I have to put on his disguise?
[4723.24s -> 4726.44s]  Do I have like a his just how do I turn it on?
[4742.39s -> 4753.29s]  Okay two guys it's like Halloween costumes coming and steal all your stuff.
[4754.65s -> 4759.13s]  These aren't even Halloween costumes. Why do I think this is so out of the ordinary?
[4759.13s -> 4762.81s]  You're dressed as a doctor and I'm dressed as a priest. Why these Halloween costumes?
[4762.81s -> 4766.97s]  No they are Halloween costumes because that's the number one thing that's fucking sold at the
[4766.97s -> 4772.89s]  Halloween store is look at me I'm the priest or look at me I'm dressed as a doctor. I'm a doctor
[4772.89s -> 4793.67s]  dickhead. So this these are costumes. Steal rest and go key card. Red ammo. You gotta be the lookout
[4793.67s -> 4810.02s]  man. All right good job. We have to go to 13. Oh that's not that's like literally right there.
[4810.74s -> 4822.41s]  All right let's go this way.
[4844.94s -> 4849.34s]  That's the same thing from Lamy.
[4850.22s -> 4852.38s]  Ah it's going to do that thing.
[4859.98s -> 4871.56s]  Put these kids to sleep. Fuck. All right interstellar crew.
[4875.32s -> 4877.96s]  Belle Everson. What do you got? What do you got in here? What's that?
[4877.96s -> 4883.37s]  You know that sound when you've snapped on an injector clip?
[4885.05s -> 4890.97s]  That's how you know your weapon loves you back. I got a full line of weapon modifications I'd be
[4890.97s -> 4899.78s]  happy to show you. For free. Holy shit. I mean your merchant skill is equal to the value of your best
[4899.78s -> 4905.74s]  dialogue skill and is used to negotiate prices when buying and selling from vendors. And I am
[4906.54s -> 4913.30s]  a huge liar. I got a 12% discount. All right let's let's see here.
[4914.34s -> 4921.22s]  Weapon part. Okay. Extendo sight. A 2x scope that also extends the weapon's maximum range.
[4922.26s -> 4933.34s]  Increases weapon accuracy. Mr. Ouch. What else is in here? Should I grab one of these for the uh
[4934.22s -> 4944.09s]  should I grab a gyro sight for the um the revolver? Get a better scope for the sniper?
[4944.09s -> 4950.81s]  I don't have enough money. Yeah I do. Oh shit no I don't. Sell. Wait. This is important.
[4951.61s -> 4959.91s]  I have a bunch of dog shit. All right hold z to sell junk. I've got 3,100. What did I sell?
[4961.90s -> 4970.30s]  All right I can afford it now. What did I sell? Can I sell? Do they know it's stolen?
[4970.86s -> 4987.35s]  All right now let's get the extendo sight. Let's get the gyro sight. I just want one. I don't want
[4987.35s -> 4995.61s]  to buy two of them. Did I just buy two? I just want one. I just want to buy one. Why does it say
[4995.61s -> 5005.13s]  times two? Oh all right good good all right all right all right repair. I need a workbench.
[5032.14s -> 5035.18s]  Someone has got to talk with Chief Tennyson about the thermostat around here.
[5036.46s -> 5050.10s]  Ain't gonna be me. So you buying? No I'm selling. I'm selling. Dead Eye assault rifle.
[5050.90s -> 5059.69s]  I picked this up not that long ago. This is a good gun. Should I just keep it? Oh shit okay.
[5065.14s -> 5072.79s]  Okay if I sell it we'll be put back on display. So if I sell this come and we'll just be on
[5072.79s -> 5076.55s]  display again and steal it sell it put it back on display steal it sell it back on display.
[5077.11s -> 5083.64s]  What else you got back here? Look at all this stuff that's just free. It's just for free.
[5087.00s -> 5099.06s]  Look these games it doesn't matter. It is free. What? Am I in trouble? All right fuck it. Let's

[5478.28s -> 5484.31s]  people? Seriously some people are just so rude. We have. Well we're gonna just let them in.
[5485.11s -> 5493.00s]  We're told we we can't let anybody in here. Man like do they really I don't it's not like I
[5493.00s -> 5505.70s]  I just we have to enforce the rules. Yeah carry on. Something about being in space gives me the creeps.
[5505.70s -> 5510.90s]  I seriously I know what the fuck. I'm Julie doesn't talk very much but I don't understand.
[5510.90s -> 5516.65s]  That this job is fucking stressful. Feels like I'm melting. I know every day.
[5520.06s -> 5525.75s]  Metaphorically you know and physically it's hot up here. Unless you have business with the board
[5525.83s -> 5531.02s]  move along. That's what I mean. Unless you have something to do you have an ID or something like
[5531.02s -> 5534.54s]  get the fuck out of here. We're doing. We have to. It's our job to do this.
[5556.15s -> 5557.35s]  Waiting for the announcement.
[5562.66s -> 5567.06s]  This is when a teacher is going over something in class and the principal goes over the loudspeaker
[5567.06s -> 5594.22s]  and everyone. Okay I was in the middle of algebra but. Okay. Ah yes. Wheeler messaged me you were
[5594.22s -> 5599.02s]  coming. You must be the captain of the unreliable. A vessel that used to be helmed by one Alex
[5599.02s -> 5606.70s]  Hawthorne. And you are not he. Has something happened to my favorite scruffy freelancer.
[5609.82s -> 5613.58s]  Forget Alex. Why'd you impound my ship. I'm gonna wring your scrawny neck.
[5613.58s -> 5625.03s]  You sprat fuck. Give me back my ship. There's no need for hysterics. This is all a hilarious
[5625.03s -> 5632.07s]  misunderstanding. Really. Explain it. Am I laughing about this. Right. Right. You're going
[5632.07s -> 5637.99s]  important places I'm sure. Big exciting important places. And I want money too. I've removed the
[5637.99s -> 5643.51s]  flag from your ship. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience. However before you go. Open the
[5643.51s -> 5649.11s]  register. Tell me the location of Phineas Wells. I'm sure you've seen his wanted posters all over
[5649.11s -> 5655.67s]  the colony. Did Alex tell you where Wells might be. Anything. This guy's such a pushover. What.
[5656.63s -> 5662.46s]  Do I know where Phineas. Yeah. I know where he is. He's up on. He's in like. He's on a satellite.
[5662.46s -> 5669.67s]  I'll find. I know where he is. Wait. This is my. Settle out this person. What do you think I know
[5669.67s -> 5675.67s]  anything about Wells. Well Alex knew. Or he said he did. And you have his ship. Maybe he kept some
[5675.67s -> 5681.27s]  records around or conveniently placed. And I want your mustache too. Give it to me. I know that's
[5681.27s -> 5694.39s]  fake. I want to wear it. Nobody talks about Phineas. That's. Well that's just terrible news.
[5696.06s -> 5706.50s]  Going to do now. Oh I'm sorry. This is terribly unprofessional of me. Is there anything else I
[5706.50s -> 5715.30s]  might help you with. Yeah. Why. Why are you in trouble. It's personal business I'm afraid.
[5715.86s -> 5723.98s]  Miserably terribly personal. What can I do. No. Stop playing coy. What's going on. I don't intend
[5723.98s -> 5729.50s]  to be. It's just a matter of trust. This is where I start signaling like about is there a bug under
[5729.50s -> 5734.62s]  your desk. Like I'm going to put my hands in the air and be like talk talk to like open my hands up
[5734.62s -> 5743.70s]  and like under your desk. And then when I. I can nod. We can go somewhere else. How can I win your
[5743.70s -> 5750.90s]  trust. Information on the whereabouts of Phineas Wells would go a long way. It's. Well it's my
[5751.06s -> 5755.62s]  way. Right on a piece of paper bugged and then hold it up and be like
[5757.00s -> 5764.20s]  like that. OK. Information on the whereabouts of Phineas Wells would go a long way. It's. Well
[5764.20s -> 5773.77s]  it's my white whale I suppose. All right. Do we sell out the guy that cryogenically unfroze us
[5774.41s -> 5781.82s]  or. No. Fuck this guy. It's fine. Really. It's perfectly fine. I understand. Now if you've
[5781.82s -> 5818.12s]  nothing else please see yourself out. I'd like to drown myself in work. OK. I need this password
[5818.12s -> 5825.99s]  to unlock. What a new password. These guys are all heavily armed. There's no way I can get through
[5825.99s -> 5840.44s]  here. Can I steal from him. Just beat him up for the password. That doesn't. No I'm going to get
[5840.44s -> 5846.79s]  attacked. This whole thing. If I fire a weapon here this whole town is going to go on lockdown.
[5855.37s -> 5874.70s]  No. No no no. I can't. I did what I wanted to do. I was passing through.
[5879.86s -> 5884.38s]  Sell out Phineas and you'll get the password. I'll get the password eventually.
[5888.82s -> 5892.06s]  What the hell. Sorry about the heat.
[5892.78s -> 5898.55s]  Chief Tanison will get the radiators fixed soon. Of course. What if I sell him out and then kill him.
[5898.55s -> 5904.23s]  Zero G brew extra refreshing. It's an ale that's good for what else.
[5905.19s -> 5912.06s]  Oh and it's not the best choice. It's Spacer's choice. Taste the freedom.
[5913.27s -> 5919.27s]  A lot of slogans to keep track of. Sometimes I forget. All right.
[5921.51s -> 5928.23s]  How did you get that. I'm bound to satisfy headgear related inquiries. Please send any
[5928.23s -> 5933.59s]  complaints to our consumer care headwear division. It's not a complaint. It's I would I want. When
[5933.67s -> 5943.27s]  can I get that. You would never ask if you knew what it's like in here. I mean why anyone can be
[5943.27s -> 5949.59s]  a Spacer's Choice Consumer Relations Choice Specialist. Just keep your nose clean and aim
[5949.59s -> 5965.98s]  for the moon. Talk it. But is there a bug under your desk. Bug. All right. Have a look. Well you
[5965.98s -> 5980.20s]  can get them. Huh. Isn't that something. Lie plus five. I need I have to have this. It was made for
[5980.20s -> 6015.10s]  this character. How much are they. They're not that expensive. It doesn't show it. Unbelievable.
[6016.50s -> 6039.02s]  How could they. How could they. Wait wrong person. OK. I just got freaked out. So I have one on. Hey
[6039.82s -> 6043.18s]  you want to join us. You should give our latest product to try.
[6044.12s -> 6050.76s]  All the all the talk see free. Get one for Sam with activated charcoal. Don't take my word for it.
[6050.76s -> 6059.02s]  See for yourself. We're gonna have one for Sam to make a choice. Spacer's Choice. Hey we're wearing
[6059.02s -> 6067.56s]  the same hat. I got you too. I mean. Yeah. Same hat. All right. You are. Looks really good on you.
[6067.56s -> 6073.54s]  Sam can't wear it. It's a robot on your giant head. Hope you're very happy in there. Wear it
[6073.54s -> 6082.30s]  with pride. No one can take that away from you. OK. What do you got. Have a look. So I can't get it
[6082.30s -> 6098.92s]  for Sam. That's unfortunate. But what about. OK. Hack. Is there a lie suit. Oh. Oh. Why do you have
[6098.92s -> 6108.52s]  better shit than the person that sells these exclusively. Fun times barrel. I need it. Wait
[6108.52s -> 6115.91s]  what does that do. Crit damage 25 percent. Firing noise minus 66 percent. That's pretty good.
[6119.43s -> 6133.37s]  Taint plasma. Didn't you guys say get the plasma plasma thing. Maybe I should get plasma. I don't
[6133.37s -> 6139.91s]  do. I don't even have one of these already. How much are they. This thing's eight hundred ninety
[6139.91s -> 6151.14s]  five dollars. All right. Fine. Fuck it. All right. All right. All right. I need a workbench.
[6151.78s -> 6219.14s]  If he does it. All right. This is getting real greedy here. I can't beat this. Just totally
[6219.14s -> 6226.07s]  absolutely. No no no no. I mean I'll keep that stuff. I don't want to sell it. All right. Let's
[6226.07s -> 6252.28s]  keep going. Hey. What's in the safe. Bless my heart. A stranger come knocking on a poor old
[6252.28s -> 6259.02s]  woman's door. You here for a particular reason. Or did the neighbors tell you how good my sugar
[6259.02s -> 6265.98s]  cookies are. What made without a single natural ingredient or an oven just like store bought.
[6267.11s -> 6272.71s]  OK. What do you have to say. What do you have for sale. Want a charming copper kettle off that
[6272.71s -> 6278.63s]  girl who runs the pub. She's a fierce arm wrestler but she's no match for your pal Gladys.
[6282.89s -> 6293.48s]  Hey this lady just speaks in riddles. Plasma rifle. Axe candy. All right. Fine. I'll say I
[6293.48s -> 6299.16s]  need money. I don't have any money. OK. Too bad. Holy shit. How do I take this from you.
[6299.80s -> 6310.09s]  How I steal that. That's insane. OK. Well let's talk about stuff. Why is it hot in here.
[6310.09s -> 6315.29s]  Buy candy. Or is it just my glands acting up again. All right. Phineas sent me. He said you
[6315.29s -> 6320.89s]  could sell me a nav key to Stellar Bay. Those have been the height of illegality since Stellar Bay
[6320.89s -> 6326.17s]  turned their noses up at the board. You and I could be thrown to the void just for discussing
[6326.17s -> 6330.41s]  such a transaction. Well the guy that's on the board is a wuss. Groundbreaker is a free port.
[6331.05s -> 6337.85s]  We're outside of the board's control. For the time being at least. Now I only have the one nav key
[6338.57s -> 6344.70s]  and they're hard to come by these days. It won't be cheap. If you find yourself lacking in the bits
[6345.58s -> 6353.80s]  I might have an opportunity you'd be interested in. OK. It's ten thousand bits.
[6354.76s -> 6364.71s]  Oh my god. No one's ever found my bits lacking. Any chance of a discount. Phineas. That old kook.
[6365.43s -> 6369.35s]  He was quite the dancer back in his prime. Did he tell you? Bria lied on his feet.
[6370.31s -> 6377.24s]  Bria lied in the wallet too. He still owes me a small fortune. Laws. Maybe I should charge you
[6379.34s -> 6388.26s]  and maybe I should vaporize you. And that's when we both silent
[6388.26s -> 6391.46s]  for like a full 10 to 20 seconds and then finally she cracks.
[6396.01s -> 6398.90s]  Well I find I'm in need of a ship captain with a little
[6399.78s -> 6404.74s]  more of flexibility. Vaping. Might be this could help out the groundbreaker as well as earn some
[6404.74s -> 6411.96s]  bits. But if you've got qualms. Well qualms. Let's talk about the details. What are the jobs
[6411.96s -> 6414.76s]  do you know about? What do you got? Anything else? You might want to acquaint yourself with
[6414.76s -> 6420.28s]  June Lay Tennyson. Groundbreaker's chief. She's been trying to get a handle on this heat problem
[6420.28s -> 6426.84s]  we've got. You'll find her fretting in engineering. I'd say she's a sweet girl but lawful offends
[6426.84s -> 6438.36s]  someone call me a liar. OK. Yes dearie. I'm ready to look into it. Ain't that just a treat. So
[6438.92s -> 6445.16s]  you know Edna over in engineering. On occasion she'll pass along transmissions I might find
[6445.16s -> 6450.04s]  interesting. She sent me a recording of a distress signal she'd scraped from the
[6450.04s -> 6456.60s]  groundbreaker's calm array. Curious thing is it came from an outpost called Roseway. Roseway.
[6456.60s -> 6460.36s]  And Auntie Cleo abandoned that place years ago. That's where I need to go.
[6461.00s -> 6463.72s]  Say no more. I'm in.
[6463.72s -> 6470.54s]  You've got an ear for intrigue and a nose for bits. I like that. Here's a copy of the SOS
[6470.54s -> 6475.26s]  recording complete with the coordinates. If you should find a secret worth selling
[6475.98s -> 6481.90s]  might be I could find a buyer. Corporate bigwigs will pay top bit for inside information on their
[6481.90s -> 6487.66s]  competitors. The more we got the corpse fighting each other the less time they got to meddle in
[6487.66s -> 6494.58s]  our affairs. Abandoned outpost corporate secrets. Got it. Don't forget to come find old Gladys when
[6494.58s -> 6501.82s]  you're done. Thanks for your time. Anytime sweetheart. You know where to find me. Here
[6501.82s -> 6511.61s]  take a candy with you. Nice. That just kind of scared the shit out of me for a second.
[6512.01s -> 6527.77s]  Okay so here's the thing. I got moon man helmet and okay so I'm at 60
[6529.27s -> 6548.34s]  lying. I need to increase my weapons but it's only gonna uh inspiration. Companion abilities. You can
[6548.34s -> 6567.38s]  order companions to do special attacks. Okay let's at least get that. Now how do I go over
[6567.38s -> 6573.14s]  50? I remember to explain it. Okay let's see. Up to rank 50. After 50 you can add points directly
[6573.14s -> 6578.34s]  to specialized skills. So I have to actually add it. It doesn't work like this. Okay I see.
[6581.83s -> 6589.51s]  60 lie is scrambled auto chemicals attack at their normal speed. I gotta do some more weapons
[6589.51s -> 6599.77s]  like handguns or long guns or something. Minimum armor penetration. Yeah something like that.
[6599.77s -> 6606.97s]  Same thing with long guns. Long guns headshot it does 20 more damage at 50.
[6609.80s -> 6622.39s]  All right let's do this because it'll do both of these and then get try to get this to 50.
[6626.15s -> 6635.38s]  Dodge though. Yeah I know this character is horrible. Don't worry I know. You can command
[6635.38s -> 6639.38s]  your companions to use their special abilities on the enemy you are targeting. Companion one ability
[6639.38s -> 6650.97s]  companion two ability. Okay cool. Perk. Uh not that one. Vendor prices. That's actually pretty
[6650.97s -> 6665.03s]  good. 20 percent. I already have 10 11 percent so that'll be 30 plus percent. I'm rating few more
[6665.03s -> 6673.93s]  bits. Additional ammo stock on vendors. Companion crit chance. Minus one weapon armor durability
[6673.93s -> 6683.46s]  loss. That's pretty good. That one's good too. They're all good. I think I'm gonna do this one.
[6684.66s -> 6697.40s]  You can just repair them. Yeah recharge rate for the I don't know. I think I'm just gonna do
[6697.40s -> 6705.53s]  the this this tactical time dilation recharge rate. Yeah let's do it.
[6711.35s -> 6720.30s]  All right let's continue. I got a lot of random things to do. So uh I have to go
[6720.38s -> 6733.00s]  talk to Jun Jun Lee Tennyson or I could go do this. I could get Sam. The distress signal has a
[6733.00s -> 6739.16s]  nav coordinate embedded in it. Play it on your ship so that Ada can get to the Roseway landing
[6739.16s -> 6744.54s]  pad. All right we're gonna do this. We're gonna get out of here. We'll do that. We'll come back
[6744.54s -> 6772.55s]  into this part after. This is a bathroom. Ada. All right let's do modify. So I was going to what
[6772.55s -> 6785.24s]  was I gonna do? I have the scope right? This is times two. What's on it right now? Okay this is
[6785.24s -> 6789.96s]  power. This is times two. What's on it right now? Current extend aside is already on it.
[6791.94s -> 6800.06s]  Shit okay well I'm not gonna put no I'm not gonna put plasma on the sniper. Don't worry
[6800.06s -> 6805.91s]  nothing on this one yet. All right this is the one. I was gonna put plasma on the revolver.
[6806.47s -> 6835.82s]  Now wait this is the new one that I stole. This is an assault rifle. Plasma on the assault rifle.
[6836.62s -> 6859.82s]  Yep look at this thing. This thing's fucking nuts and it's got an extendo sight.
[6861.11s -> 6872.33s]  Exacto sight? Put an extendo sight on it too. No I'm gonna keep this one on. All right now what
[6872.33s -> 6876.55s]  did I want to do with you? Nothing. You just get the fuck out of here. You're useless now.
[6878.09s -> 6887.18s]  Actually not really. All right well that's enough. Wait where is it? 73? I don't have enough money to
[6887.18s -> 6905.83s]  do this. Fuck. Damn it. Well wait break down these pistols. I bought a bunch of bullshit.
[6910.87s -> 6925.80s]  Who are you? Hey you got a second? You got you got like a bunch of sleeping bags and stuff. Are
[6925.80s -> 6931.56s]  you trying to come onto the ship here? Fancy running into you again. Don't mind me. It's just
[6931.56s -> 6935.88s]  admiring your ship from up close. Gotta hand it to you boss. That's a fun looking ship.
[6936.76s -> 6943.61s]  Only thing it's missing is me. No. I get it. Get lost. You don't like seeing a guy stake that next
[6943.61s -> 6948.81s]  to your ship. Looks like I'm trying to ambush you or sell you something. Just give me a shot. That's
[6948.81s -> 6956.87s]  all I'm asking. No. I could be the best damn crew you ever hired. I've heard enough of you. All
[6956.87s -> 6960.15s]  right Felix tell me why should I hire you? Okay Felix consider this your interview.
[6961.03s -> 6964.39s]  If you're trying to convince me to hire you you're doing it you're going about it all wrong.
[6965.11s -> 6971.58s]  Oh okay well can you give me a couple of pointers? Sure I'll help you out here.
[6972.46s -> 6978.34s]  Don't beg. Tell me why I need you on my crew. Hey that's good advice. I like the way you think
[6978.34s -> 6981.86s]  boss. Not your boss. I never will be. Besides not like there's a line of folks standing around
[6981.86s -> 6987.54s]  hoping to get on your ship. I'm persistent. I'm eager and I'm showing initiative. What else do
[6987.54s -> 6996.86s]  you want on your crew? Um how about an interview? Sure an interview. That sounds fair. I mean first
[6996.86s -> 7009.10s]  time for everything right? Ask me anything you like. Okay what's the value of pie? Uh it's delicious
[7010.06s -> 7014.46s]  mock apple pie and a tripe kale crust maybe with a little cream on top. Classic.
[7019.80s -> 7025.82s]  That was that was an alleviate the mood interview joke.
[7026.94s -> 7030.62s]  But that's kind of overdone at this point. I don't that's that's like that's so
[7031.58s -> 7034.71s]  people do that that's so cliche now. What's your biggest flaw?
[7034.71s -> 7038.55s]  Norman told me my biggest problem was that I didn't take orders. I told him my problem
[7038.55s -> 7044.04s]  it's not with authority it's with jackasses. So yeah I guess my biggest flaw is that I don't
[7044.12s -> 7051.32s]  suffer idiots. Hope that's not a deal breaker. It is. Well I tried my best. I appreciate you
[7051.32s -> 7055.16s]  giving me another shot at least. Why? If you change your mind I'll be right here in the docking base.
[7055.16s -> 7080.38s]  Never gonna leave. He wouldn't have looked as good as you do in that mask. Yeah he told me he doesn't
[7080.38s -> 7084.22s]  suffer idiots and everyone if you're if you're just dumber than me I don't like you. It's like
[7084.22s -> 7094.36s]  okay I'm dumb. So leave. That was his mistake. I gave him a chance. He made like a shitty cliche
[7095.08s -> 7101.03s]  this is a fun interview joke and then I wasn't feeling it because that's kind of cliche and then
[7101.03s -> 7104.47s]  he said he doesn't like stupid people and I'm stupid. You want me to hire that person?
[7105.59s -> 7114.36s]  Not gonna happen. Welcome back captain. How can I be of assistance? I picked up a distress call.
[7114.36s -> 7121.80s]  Play it for me. Yes captain beginning playback now. There's viscera and death everywhere.
[7121.80s -> 7128.44s]  Gunfire gnashing teeth. They're unemployed. For law's sake if anyone's receiving this please send
[7128.44s -> 7140.65s]  help. What? Captain we are now capable of accessing the Roseway landing pad. Also corporate protocol
[7140.65s -> 7146.33s]  requires that all distress signals include a list of key personnel for retrieval. The embedded names
[7146.33s -> 7157.88s]  are Anton Crane, Von Cortez, and Orson Shaw. Okay goodbye. See you soon captain. No no no.
[7160.44s -> 7174.30s]  Terra 2. Roseway landing pad. We're now in orbit above Roseway captain. Cool all right let's go.
[7176.78s -> 7189.16s]  Roseway. Yeah scene three is got me wearing a mask now. This is the worst fucking acting gig
[7189.16s -> 7207.99s]  I've ever done. What? It pays all right. I'm gonna stick with it. Where's my friend? All right let's
[7207.99s -> 7218.71s]  do uh not the distress signal. The doom that came to Roseway. Distress call uh tomorrow. No no no.
[7218.71s -> 7233.75s]  The cleaning machine. There it is. This way? Wait I deselected him? How the fuck did I do that?
[7243.27s -> 7261.98s]  The unreliable narrator. Oh I see underneath. There it is. Okay what's this? Insert captain's
[7261.98s -> 7268.36s]  identification cartridge to initiate remote landing. I think I already did that. Follow me.
[7269.08s -> 7277.02s]  Let's take out the all right wait wait wait wait wait wait. Dead eye assault rifle. Let's check it
[7277.02s -> 7292.52s]  out. Ooh yep nice. Good thing I'm so glad I stole this. Is there a wall here? Of course there is.
[7292.52s -> 7305.82s]  Adventure does favor the bold. Does. Did I scream? Was it him? This is a silent protagonist. They
[7305.82s -> 7321.64s]  don't scream. We all scream for ice cream. I did half of it. I didn't do the other half though.
[7322.36s -> 7342.98s]  See if I can get this right in the head. Won't get any mercy from me. Wow. Fate shines on us today.
[7344.78s -> 7354.65s]  This thing is pretty good from that far away. Yeah that's what we're making pretty damn good
[7354.65s -> 7378.95s]  progress. Nice. Wow we actually are can kill things now. All it took was a little bit of
[7378.95s -> 7392.12s]  thievery. I'm sorry. I didn't. You're smart enough to not run fast into this. Everything's fine. I'm
[7392.12s -> 7413.29s]  good. Just eat an apple. Eat a can of tuna. All right. Acid steeper is in there. It's a workbench.
[7414.01s -> 7425.72s]  All right. Is it where we have to be careful? Give me my my revolver. Yeah. Yep. Yes. Do the
[7425.72s -> 7447.26s]  tuna sound. What does the tuna sound? What does that mean? Oh shit. Do your super move. Over there.
[7450.74s -> 7470.41s]  What? He has a knife now? What is going on? Oh he's dead. So it does a cut scene.
[7472.87s -> 7489.34s]  Oh okay that's weird. Can I heal you? I could spend hours reflecting on the secret workings
[7489.42s -> 7496.14s]  of the universe. Little else in this colony offers such a relaxing pastime. So tell me
[7496.14s -> 7517.37s]  what's on your mind. I excel at confessional listening. Okay slow down. Cleanliness isn't
[7517.37s -> 7522.65s]  much of a priority I take it. Oh no like wait. If you need to get into the armory and don't have
[7522.65s -> 7552.50s]  the code ask me. If I'm not around check the front desk at the antibiotics lab. No. God damn it.
[7552.50s -> 7558.10s]  Where's the where's the antibiotics lab? Is it auntie or auntie? I thought it was
[7558.10s -> 7574.76s]  auntie. Where where is that? I don't have any lock picking skill. Shit. Why can't you be a lock
[7574.76s -> 7603.67s]  picker? There's no other way to get in there. I have to go find that person. Oh that don't work.
[7611.72s -> 7649.50s]  Ow. Oh my god. Is this a boss? That thing was insane. Okay what were you what were you guarding?
[7654.55s -> 7663.32s]  No nothing. Who's calling me? Oh no there's a bunch of them. I have to we have to leave.
[7663.32s -> 7679.67s]  This is not going to work out. Holy shit there's somebody right at the front door.
[7682.92s -> 7702.46s]  Super move. Oh wow that was awesome. Nice work. Oh still alive. All right that was pretty cool.
[7702.46s -> 7721.06s]  I gotta say. All right there's a chest over here. Oh wait a minute. Smaller than a prison cell.
[7721.06s -> 7732.12s]  Come on you have to passcode. Thank god. The password I think was one two three four by the
[7732.12s -> 7757.08s]  way. What's that? Toothpaste? Okay we did it. That was hot. I don't know okay is that let me go over
[7757.08s -> 7763.24s]  something very quickly you guys. So before the stream started somebody I don't know who you
[7763.24s -> 7770.62s]  might even still be here. Somebody said dude you should do the whole stream in a Boston accent.
[7771.96s -> 7779.42s]  And I keep thinking back to that person and I'm doing it because I'm thinking about them
[7779.42s -> 7802.38s]  saying it. All right here we go. Like you're in my head. All right what is this? Armory logs. Force
[7803.26s -> 7815.54s]  flog the flogistinator pistol. Force flogisticotron pistol status functional untrained
[7815.54s -> 7819.62s]  personnel must attend site safety seminar before using as a seminar officer is not currently
[7819.62s -> 7828.94s]  available recommend permanent secure storage ammunition entry is not found where do I get
[7828.94s -> 7846.58s]  that uh where do I get the flogistinator plasma carbine what's that do acid steeper there it is
[7846.58s -> 7861.99s]  energy cells I think that's all there is to do in here I could keep going down is there anything
[7861.99s -> 7876.39s]  else in here there's something else in rose way the stress signal the schematics for orson's
[7876.39s -> 7885.24s]  prototype would likely be valuable to gladis the stress call from the broadcast tower and
[7886.82s -> 7896.02s]  company secrets schematics yeah there it is so there is something down here maintenance logs
[7896.58s -> 7903.77s]  is this too much info no it's not there's one sentence we don't have a replacement someone
[7903.77s -> 7908.89s]  tried to disable the mandatory consumer broadcast on 17 the thing got stuck in maximum volume mode
[7908.89s -> 7913.53s]  until we factory reset it 12 it's serious malfunction today we shut it down for now
[7914.09s -> 7917.69s]  no response on the behavior modules for the time being we'll have to just uh hype in the chat
[7918.89s -> 7951.77s]  whatever it says where's your uh belly why don't you not have a belly everyone you keep seeing
[7951.77s -> 7967.06s]  everyone it's just me mono lens oh boy the cartridges okay let's get the schematic
[7967.22s -> 7973.62s]  um detailed drawings of an advanced pistol revisions and comments are scrawled across
[7973.62s -> 7979.14s]  the image in mostly illegible writing except for the name orson shaw scribbled in the corner
[7979.14s -> 7988.86s]  the schematics depict a flog pistol from a brand name force which is not native to the halcyon
[7988.86s -> 8005.51s]  colony it is unclear from these plans what a flog does okay i got plans energy cell what's up here
[8008.62s -> 8014.12s]  okay investigate rose where to find potential company secrets that could be sold to the highest
[8014.12s -> 8023.80s]  bidder so i have one of the company secrets but there's also this distress call and i want to see
[8023.80s -> 8030.81s]  what it's what's going on over here so we're gonna go that way i'm not just gonna skip everything i
[8030.81s -> 8054.54s]  want to just i want to see what's going on this is a lot of shit you know that you didn't check
[8054.54s -> 8063.21s]  literally half the room i don't have time for that here they come what are you doing out here

[8147.77s -> 8152.65s]  dog it's a robot that's in a dog costume because then he can blend in as the dog and
[8153.77s -> 8164.60s]  that's like you know you've seen the show and then sometimes sometimes he goes
[8167.32s -> 8170.54s]  and everyone laughs everyone thinks it's fun
[8171.10s -> 8189.48s]  don't they go that's right don't mess with us and then sometimes he'll go i want pancakes

[8404.10s -> 8410.90s]  scientist name anton crane someone said he's panicking inside the comm center it actually
[8410.90s -> 8417.32s]  looks pretty calm out here alarms went off raps broke loose and i hightailed it in here to get
[8417.32s -> 8424.55s]  a wall between me and them beasts you said the raps broke loose did you have them in a cage
[8424.55s -> 8436.25s]  um forget i said anything about that okay oh before i forget anti-cleo's i see anti-cleo's
[8437.45s -> 8446.10s]  better than nature anti not like that crappy basers choice i had it right actually i think
[8446.10s -> 8456.89s]  i need to do something here don't i uh solution uh distress signal no no no long tomorrow
[8459.13s -> 8471.90s]  no i thought i could get uh oh it's a doctor i like you if you've come to end my life
[8471.90s -> 8479.69s]  let's be on with it oh not actually one of them are you no did you send the distress call you kind
[8479.69s -> 8484.57s]  of look like the guy that sent the distress call right the first time i hear to end your life
[8488.68s -> 8497.38s]  if i knew who he was he'd already be dead what i um i'm anton crane the lead scientist here
[8498.49s -> 8504.97s]  i must apologize if my call diverted you i may have panicked everything's under control now
[8504.97s -> 8514.76s]  though truth be told what did you think i was why one of our attackers of course obviously they
[8514.76s -> 8522.36s]  were drawn here in an attempt to make off with my research why cancel the distress call my research
[8522.36s -> 8527.56s]  may not quite fall within legal parameters illegal dead i'm under orders to maintain wireless
[8528.36s -> 8532.68s]  however having your head used as target practice can addle one's thinking
[8533.80s -> 8538.28s]  i cut the call immediately once i've gathered my width so it was a home office can't know what's
[8538.28s -> 8544.79s]  happening here oh yeah tell me what you're actually doing here or i will let them know myself
[8546.23s -> 8552.23s]  and take great joy in doing so i might add thank you doctor max i appreciate that if i don't get
[8552.23s -> 8558.63s]  that research back my life has got me backed up we were tasked with formulating a new and improved
[8558.63s -> 8568.68s]  dental gel dental gel yes i see very important uh what's the dental gel toothpaste one cannot
[8568.68s -> 8577.94s]  exaggerate the benefits of good dental hygiene may i continue please do while doing research
[8577.94s -> 8582.74s]  on enzymes specific to the raptidons digestive system we developed an additive which we
[8582.74s -> 8591.29s]  subsequently discovered to be the most effective appetite suppressant ever uh you can couch it
[8591.29s -> 8597.69s]  however you like it's still just toothpaste uh diet toothpaste not just any diet toothpaste
[8598.41s -> 8606.31s]  the ultimate diet toothpaste that's like discovering the best rocket fuel ever
[8607.19s -> 8611.35s]  oh i'm certain it could be made into that as well with only a few changes to its molecular
[8611.35s -> 8616.95s]  i'm just the ogre from warcraft you're missing the point let's focus for a moment shall we
[8616.95s -> 8622.31s]  even if you disregard the obvious value of auntie cleo's apazap diet toothpaste in and of itself
[8622.31s -> 8627.83s]  we're talking about my career here toothpaste oh how absolutely adequate toothpaste good
[8627.83s -> 8638.73s]  that's i'm speaking twice with two different heads uh auntie cleo's apazap diet toothpaste in itself
[8640.34s -> 8647.46s]  nice is it not came up with that myself oh yeah an ogre mage almost as befuddled as my co-workers
[8647.46s -> 8653.62s]  here what do you want from me hours ago a group of vicious malcontents fell upon us
[8654.26s -> 8660.82s]  shot up our labs and loosed our research subjects the raptidons if those cretins get their hands on
[8660.82s -> 8668.09s]  my research well they'll need not kill me remove the cretins retrieved this research check you want
[8668.09s -> 8674.89s]  should i handle your rapidon problem yes but don't kill our mother if it's avoidable we've
[8674.89s -> 8680.57s]  need of her to replenish our stocks i think there's gas in the lab somewhere that can be
[8680.57s -> 8686.65s]  used to put them out the research is in the safe in my office you'll have need of my code and key
[8686.65s -> 8692.97s]  card the lab's entrance is in the side of a hill you can't miss it if you just follow the road
[8693.05s -> 8702.95s]  you'll pass by the town's original by the grand architect jameson he's in the old lab who's jameson
[8702.95s -> 8709.91s]  my protege i sent him to retrieve some metabolic precursors and i forgot him how do you forget
[8709.91s -> 8716.98s]  what you forgot him you left him to die you should be ashamed of yourself don't you think it weighs on
[8716.98s -> 8724.02s]  me he was my responsibility all of them were ah regardless of their thinking on the matter yet
[8724.02s -> 8730.62s]  you send me to do this if he has died too many have been lost too many black marks against my
[8730.62s -> 8740.55s]  name and far too much paperwork yeah yeah you're gonna have to give up your swishy latex doctor

[8828.97s -> 8833.37s]  secret lab which lies at the end of the paved road out of the way eliminate the outlaws deal
[8833.37s -> 8846.89s]  with the rap raptidons i'm just gonna go get it now this he's down there too anton's research

[9882.68s -> 9889.85s]  breach of protocol how'd you get it uh truth be told the raptidons did most of the work on the
[9889.85s -> 9897.03s]  door not sure they know what a lock is uh anton sent me to get you can't use the centrifuge without
[9897.03s -> 9902.39s]  supervision can't file reports without him double checking their every word can't save myself from
[9902.39s -> 9908.79s]  mortal peril it's like he thinks i'm a child his hands-on management style is coming to a point
[9908.79s -> 9914.31s]  of contention i tell you you're upset that he sent me to rescue you take it up with him if you'd like
[9914.31s -> 9920.94s]  now go before my before more wraps find this place yeah like take it up with him i have nothing to

[9957.50s -> 9969.50s]  okay this one no it's this one so eliminate the outlaws and the raptidons so that's downed
[9969.50s -> 9978.97s]  in the lab i guess maybe somewhere we're gonna go take a look is there a way for me to go down
[9980.39s -> 9986.81s]  there is okay uh do you think here's a little trick i learned in prison
[9988.33s -> 10015.13s]  you went to prison live watch out he can do this very often
[10016.17s -> 10037.26s]  anymore i think that's it no you're going the wrong way okay so let's get this get this
[10038.78s -> 10053.74s]  get this oh a hack i can hack this anti riot gear i'll take it all right now over here i have to
[10053.74s -> 10059.34s]  deal with the raptidons don't kill the mother i'm gonna fuck this up the mother's probably gonna die
[10064.76s -> 10084.57s]  right over here wait is it just up there hold on it's just in that room i guess it's just in here
[10085.21s -> 10096.01s]  oh this is the wrong lab wrong place oh okay all right all right all right all right well
[10096.89s -> 10113.50s]  all right can i fast travel anywhere wait a minute fine and safe so we're gonna go back this way
[10115.96s -> 10128.78s]  wrong planet you're on the wrong planet that would be stupid all right truth be told
[10129.34s -> 10137.22s]  this weapon is the only weapon i have that's worth using the revolver isn't doing much damage
[10137.38s -> 10152.28s]  don't i'm dead okay i'm not dead i can't believe you guys made it slow
[10162.41s -> 10173.88s]  i just like watching them do it okay here we go there's a scrap mechanic thing over here
[10175.06s -> 10179.59s]  deal with the outlaws right i think i have to kill the everything we'll find out
[10180.15s -> 10185.37s]  i wanted to sneak into a secret lab by crawling through the fence like they do in the cereals
[10185.37s -> 10193.88s]  i guess not let's go cohort lab that's my signature for falling off a cliff is saying don't
[10200.31s -> 10213.72s]  yeah i can sell all these shotguns save it okay i need to do gas on the mother
[10214.52s -> 10234.23s]  do i have any do i have gas that's a huge splash damage too are we good
[10235.11s -> 10243.21s]  wait that's the last of them okay ma thought it said mother i was like well that's great
[10245.14s -> 10259.42s]  all right got tail i did so the way to go down but let me just let me look around well it's not all
[10259.42s -> 10264.94s]  about going as fast as possible sometimes you just need to take a minute and pick up everything
[10265.90s -> 10270.07s]  and either sell it immediately and not even i probably not even gonna look at it in my inventory
[10270.07s -> 10272.31s]  once but it's money
[10279.58s -> 10285.62s]  so eliminate the outlaws and then the raptidons and then the data is over there so let's just go
[10285.62s -> 10312.78s]  let's do the raptidons first all right well i guess we're doing this first that guy's got a
[10312.78s -> 10324.97s]  heavy machine gun burning with the toothpaste nice work what you got can i take that thing
[10326.09s -> 10339.50s]  jeweled ring i think he had a heavy weapons gun in parts good all right uh outlaws uh
[10340.06s -> 10350.50s]  raptidons this way messages good news and bad news bad news is that we've got a sprat problem
[10350.50s -> 10355.94s]  the good news is that my have fastos hammers clobbered your precious rizzo's rangers would
[10355.94s -> 10362.10s]  you care for some anti-cleo's trip kale pasta sauce with your humble pie okay you'll need to
[10362.10s -> 10366.18s]  sedate them manually bring a few canisters of sedative and hook it up to the auxiliary
[10366.18s -> 10373.99s]  terminal in the main research chamber bring a few canisters of sedative and hook it up to the
[10373.99s -> 10382.57s]  auxiliary terminal in the main research chamber after don okay i have here a form proving the
[10382.57s -> 10388.97s]  relocation of our raptidon mother to the main hall a form signed by you first of all the structural
[10388.97s -> 10393.61s]  integrity of our raptidon tanks are not nearly sufficient to contain an enraged raptidon mother
[10395.64s -> 10399.16s]  secondly raptidons are notoriously territorial and extremely protective of the young please
[10399.16s -> 10403.90s]  stop me if i'm using too many numbers for you seeing how you don't seem to realize that
[10403.90s -> 10410.98s]  raptidon mother plus raptidon tank equals murder all right what's this sedative canister
[10411.70s -> 10416.28s]  is guaranteed to render even the largest raptidon unconscious been no less than six
[10416.28s -> 10428.57s]  hours and has a refreshing antiseptic scent all right okay there she is so
[10430.18s -> 10443.10s]  where do i put the canister in to knock them all out i guess we'll find it eliminate the outlaws
[10444.12s -> 10471.75s]  wait just shoot it all right turn it on you need three sedative canisters
[10475.82s -> 10499.67s]  run run run what's quick load uh so i need three canisters i get more money if i do it this way
[10500.47s -> 10505.11s]  i've walked by one and i'm never looking at it and going that looks a little odd what's that thing
[10511.35s -> 10524.98s]  damn it can i i'm not sure i can they're inside there's another one okay so that's one two
[10525.78s -> 10537.05s]  i need one more we see one let me know there are two more inside wait inside the actual chamber
[10537.77s -> 10549.42s]  so i just run up can i wait you guys wait here can i tell them to wait i just ran past two of them
[10550.14s -> 10564.65s]  oh i didn't what are you talking about where so i have two one two three
[10568.73s -> 10582.15s]  i would do they actually have one coming back up in here let me see no no no
[10585.90s -> 10596.12s]  that all right easy hey over here oh good you're not shooting at me
[10596.12s -> 10603.40s]  doing fine and safe it's been a bit of a day so i'll get to the point yes i have crane's research
[10603.40s -> 10610.06s]  no i'm not giving it back sorry to disappoint you what are you talking about who the fuck is crane
[10610.78s -> 10617.16s]  i suppose it does not matter either crane sent you or you are some scavenger come to
[10617.16s -> 10623.80s]  rob me in my moment of weakness let's make a deal i'd like to go on living you'd probably like to
[10623.80s -> 10627.56s]  make some money no i'm not out of here and i will pay you for your trouble
[10630.17s -> 10640.36s]  okay uh or i could just shoot you and skip all the hassle make me a deal your life is in my hands
[10640.36s -> 10648.04s]  right now a good turn trust me i'll make it worth your while but that's uh you need to
[10650.10s -> 10655.94s]  my while is worth a lot i am good for my word you will be equitably rewarded on my honor
[10656.76s -> 10659.72s]  but i will not haggle or bargain with you until you help me
[10662.58s -> 10667.78s]  huh well why are you down here the same reason you are more than likely i imagine we picked up
[10667.78s -> 10675.38s]  the same tip secret research facility minimal security i like how that was a lie even though
[10675.38s -> 10682.84s]  you as your character are too dumb to even remember who crane was yeah it could be either way but it
[10683.16s -> 10686.44s]  is if you're just if you're dumb and you don't remember is not remembering a lie
[10688.31s -> 10693.93s]  we've had that conversation on this stream before if i said something i don't remember it did i
[10693.93s -> 10701.22s]  lie about it or was it just too stupid to not to not remember it now i'm not a bandit like you
[10702.10s -> 10708.66s]  oh please i'm not shaking down valuables from hapless travelers i'm stealing corporate secrets
[10713.10s -> 10718.30s]  this is an underground lab off the radar that means their research is secret
[10718.70s -> 10725.02s]  and secrets are always valuable granted diet toothpaste is not exactly what comes to mind
[10725.02s -> 10730.78s]  when i imagine it's too stupid to not remember it so you remembered it no other way do you like
[10730.78s -> 10738.22s]  diet toothpaste can you imagine a more pernicious example of corporate materialism i do not know
[10738.22s -> 10745.86s]  what is worse working here or dying here i've been watching the vod and your tarot rant made
[10745.86s -> 10750.50s]  me really sad can't believe people don't fucking read on the toilet thank you welcome welcome back
[10750.50s -> 10755.14s]  to the stream thank you all right you went through all this trouble to steal a formula
[10755.14s -> 10760.66s]  for diet toothpaste i already know the secret what matters is that i have been lied to i was led to
[10760.66s -> 10766.58s]  believe this was a high priority corporate facility hiding valuable research this job was
[10766.58s -> 10772.66s]  not supposed to end with me stuck in some wretched lab smelling like rats so i would be very much
[10772.66s -> 10781.00s]  obliged if you gave me a break what do you need the first thing i need is a key card to unlock my
[10781.00s -> 10787.32s]  door then i'd need you to clear me a path out of here there are two ways out the quickest is
[10787.32s -> 10792.68s]  through the front door but cleo security's bottled up in there if you don't want to shoot them i
[10792.68s -> 10798.20s]  suppose you could talk to them the other way out is through the loading bay but you'd have to clear
[10798.20s -> 10808.78s]  out the wraps for me then i could just slip out the back side unseen kill her and take the recipe
[10808.78s -> 10821.02s]  for diet toothpaste yourself you will be the best dumb space dentist uh and it was a word you might
[10821.02s -> 10826.06s]  have made off of this research even he even called you cretins all right i'm gonna need a good reason
[10826.06s -> 10832.46s]  for the risk my neck because crane is a tool because no good deed goes unrewarded because doing
[10832.46s -> 10842.86s]  me a good turn is the honorable and decent thing take your pick okay um we're going in a circle
[10843.90s -> 10847.98s]  why should i do this for you i am willing to go halves with you halves not good enough
[10848.78s -> 10854.54s]  and i will gladly negotiate with you but only why should i do this for me because of this well what
[10854.54s -> 10858.46s]  do i need to do you need to do this well why should i help you because i'm gonna give you this money
[10858.46s -> 10862.78s]  well that's not good enough what why do i need to do this well because of this well why should i do
[10862.78s -> 10868.66s]  that i'm going around a circle all right let's go you might be the first stroke of luck i've had
[10868.66s -> 10877.62s]  all day whoa whoa wait what i'm in your debt recover the data that's i can't recover i'm this
[10877.62s -> 10893.26s]  is the data uh don't flatter yourself on my honor you will be well rewarded okay sit tight take your
[10893.26s -> 10903.43s]  time i am to my chagrin not going anywhere no you aren't all right so now i have to i have to get
[10903.43s -> 10910.31s]  you out of here so we have to clear the rat okay raptidons clear i need one more of those uh one
[10910.31s -> 10922.22s]  more of those things one more canister i'm gonna do the raptidon way this person friendly i could
[10922.22s -> 10936.81s]  i said i could talk to them okay um i'm supposed to give her the outlaws why are they not attacking
[10936.81s -> 10953.53s]  me now i what because i talked to her carry on i treated new vegas like a joke treating outer
[10953.53s -> 10959.85s]  worlds like a super serious role playing game well i have one rebuttal to you and that is there's no

[13148.60s -> 13162.98s]  and that opens up tier two yeah okay we have some new stuff i feel like it always has to be
[13162.98s -> 13170.81s]  a shotgun though because it has so much weight behind it that turn you back to the camera
[13170.81s -> 13181.22s]  spin around shoot with shotgun is just way cooler than i mean it has to be a shotgun always you can

[13872.86s -> 13880.73s]  maybe i can look into it i was a doctor be my guest if you know something i don't about dealing
[13880.73s -> 13886.65s]  with hospital bureaucracy i'll be impressed you talking to the right person you open that door

[13904.31s -> 13909.93s]  told the others the records saying miss doyle checked herself in and requested i admit no
[13909.93s -> 13919.96s]  visitors requests of our patients are paramount so no you may not see her the records say you
[13919.96s -> 13925.40s]  actually spoken to her yourself she's not my patient i'm certain no one on my staff would
[13925.40s -> 13936.54s]  falsify patient records if that's what you're implying it is take care yeah have a good day

[14006.04s -> 14012.30s]  i'm now your holographic shroud is activated giving you temporary access to this restricted
[14012.30s -> 14018.14s]  area moving drains the shroud's energy when it runs out personnel will see and interrogate you
[14018.14s -> 14022.30s]  talk your way out of the interrogation to reset your shroud it'll get harder to talk your way out
[14022.30s -> 14030.49s]  the more you're interrogated what looking sharp why do you look like you're about to
[14030.49s -> 14043.80s]  fucking take a swing at me okay so i'm pretending to be a doctor we're looking for jesse all right

[14437.32s -> 14444.95s]  i believe the captain is proposing an indenture contract i didn't say nothing about her teeth i
[14444.95s -> 14450.52s]  would know he's got to be worth more than alive than dead you should know that dentist that's
[14450.52s -> 14455.08s]  not unreasonable what guarantee do i have that she'll agree to the terms you negotiate

[14469.19s -> 14475.11s]  of her organs will allow a profit in that case i expect her liver is uh used goods as it were

[14564.39s -> 14567.11s]  if you're looking for a medic i can work my debt off
[14571.64s -> 14582.36s]  we're always looking for new doctors and dentists but if i'm being honest and i prefer not to your
[14582.36s -> 14587.40s]  doc i was about ready to pick up another contract anyway and you settled this in a pretty tidy
[14587.40s -> 14593.16s]  fashion she's a doctor not a dentist you're competent but i was a doctor before i was a

[14670.92s -> 14686.36s]  i kind of just gave up on it reesee

[14704.76s -> 14713.91s]  there's a giant hatch thought there'd be more machinery must be housed on a sub level what
[14713.91s -> 14721.19s]  happened to the cool priest i'm sorry fecal matter from alien life forms there's no longer a priest
[14721.19s -> 14722.31s]  this is a dentist
[14730.07s -> 14734.47s]  junley tennyson i'm captain around here but chief to my friends hope you don't mind the
[14734.47s -> 14741.59s]  formal introduction groundbreaker doesn't see many visitors uh junko nice place you got here i'm
[14741.59s -> 14748.39s]  captain of the unreliable recently unshackled from groundbreaker's impound good for you hope
[14748.39s -> 14752.79s]  you scared some sense into those bureaucrats giving you trouble just so we understand each
[14752.79s -> 14758.23s]  other i'm the final word on the ship the mardits the crew the engineers their family i hope there
[14758.23s -> 14768.17s]  won't be any problems while you're visiting i'll do whatever i can to help don't go making trouble
[14768.17s -> 14773.45s]  and chances are you won't find any that's how i like it here so what brings you to groundbreaker
[14773.45s -> 14776.89s]  i'm curious even though nine times up to ten the answers just passing through
[14776.97s -> 14787.70s]  um statistics don't lie we see a lot of the same faces coming and going most of them board spies
[14789.06s -> 14796.65s]  makes it hard to trust outsiders you seem different so welcome aboard uh you don't have a
[14796.65s -> 14800.33s]  lot of faith in the board what's it like being in command it seems kind of warm in here you don't
[14800.33s -> 14805.85s]  have a lot of faith in the board you're right i don't the board is after two things bits and power
[14805.85s -> 14812.36s]  and they only get it by sticking their nose where it doesn't belong you must not like bedford very
[14812.36s -> 14817.64s]  much i like to think of myself as a nice person but if that gaudy embassy of his was on fire
[14817.64s -> 14822.92s]  i might hold my breath a moment before activating the sprinkler system the board wants control of a
[14822.92s -> 14827.96s]  groundbreaker and leeches like udon bedford will do anything to please their corporate masters
[14830.54s -> 14835.59s]  uh how do you keep the board at a safe distance when i have something to offer but i can also be a
[14835.59s -> 14840.63s]  real hard ass it'd be a joy if i could kick out the corporate merchants and reclaim the docking
[14840.71s -> 14845.43s]  fees in my lifetime too much of groundbreaker's income is flowing in the wrong direction
[14845.99s -> 14851.67s]  i'd like to see that change okay you've got my attention well what do i what do you want
[14852.47s -> 14857.96s]  what's it like being in command frustrating everything down to the circuit boards has
[14857.96s -> 14862.92s]  passed warranty so i have the pleasure of making life or death decisions on a shoestring budget
[14863.96s -> 14868.44s]  plus there's no time to train my successor or document fixes in a way that anyone outside the
[14868.44s -> 14874.92s]  family would understand okay who has a family business sure is the tennyson's came over on
[14874.92s -> 14879.88s]  the groundbreaker my grandmother chief gang kept it together during the crossing and until she died
[14880.60s -> 14887.08s]  and my grandfather ben only recently when my mom died then i took the leap from chief engineer to
[14887.08s -> 14891.64s]  captain he left behind a really weird watch and we didn't know what to do with we brought it to
[14891.64s -> 14897.64s]  antiques roadshow and they said it was 44 dollars so we sold it we didn't know what it was it was
[14897.64s -> 14903.94s]  in a shoebox upstairs it was different knowing that i couldn't turn to anyone who could answer
[14903.94s -> 14909.46s]  the tough questions for me maybe you can see why i'm protective of groundbreaker this ship is

[19133.74s -> 19147.91s]  clear my schedule this newcomer has a meeting with me i gotta say great teeth uh but you have a
[19147.91s -> 19155.10s]  meeting with me to hear that power play celia we don't make them like this anymore in halcyon
[19155.98s -> 19165.22s]  i only hope you don't judge me by my handshake now what business brings you here me chart my
[19165.22s -> 19169.86s]  own path going where the wind takes me i'm just looking for the information broker it's all i
[19169.86s -> 19176.26s]  care about why he's probably still out at devil's peak not that he's had the courtesy to notify me
[19176.26s -> 19183.00s]  at any rate but if you're here for him i suppose that means you aren't here for salt tuna
[19184.90s -> 19189.38s]  they could always be both if i have to eat one more weird science project past office food in
[19189.38s -> 19198.57s]  this sprat fucked colony i'm gonna stab someone it could be both now now there's no need to humor me
[19198.57s -> 19205.21s]  i'm used to this particular letdown i had hoped that livening up our advertisements with enticing
[19205.21s -> 19212.57s]  figures would draw the other corporations back to our bosom but it seems we're back to the drawing
[19212.57s -> 19220.25s]  board uh if you're free of the other corporations why would you want to bring them back surviving
[19220.25s -> 19226.73s]  alone isn't as easy as it looks thanks to the so-called hazard clause monarch has been cut off
[19226.73s -> 19232.49s]  from the board's resources and protection for 10 years now we've kept ourselves in business by
[19232.49s -> 19238.09s]  trading with individual corporations but given the off the books nature of those transactions
[19238.09s -> 19247.77s]  such arrangements are precarious and you're tired of scrounging and scraping by is that it
[19247.77s -> 19255.70s]  freedom is a tempting ideal but a rather costly paramour exactly intellectualism fuels the train
[19255.70s -> 19262.98s]  to mankind's future but the tracks the train runs on are forged from practicality yes it's as though
[19262.98s -> 19269.78s]  the good vicar has plucked the very words from my brain so now we're in right so we're gonna we're
[19269.78s -> 19276.94s]  in so what do you want to do well mr nandi here has a rather ingenious plan to get msi restored
[19276.94s -> 19283.10s]  to the board on our terms mind you returning to the board is your only chance if you hope to
[19283.10s -> 19290.70s]  survive here on monarch that doesn't mean it'll be easily achievable indeed not no worthwhile plan
[19290.70s -> 19296.70s]  was ever simple that's what i always say and if our advertising scheme hasn't borne fruit
[19296.70s -> 19304.84s]  then perhaps it's time we took matters into our own hands this lady knows what's up it's true
[19304.84s -> 19310.28s]  our celia is an alarmingly competent middle manager at any other company she'd be wasted
[19310.28s -> 19315.16s]  in data entry the plan she refers to is a two-pronged approach dentist and all the
[19316.04s -> 19323.64s]  you stellar bay properly defended only we have to have other things besides dentist
[19323.64s -> 19327.72s]  references to every piece of dialogue i've got to come up with other things to say
[19330.95s -> 19336.55s]  with a bolt 52 cartridge of course if you can get us what we need to rejoin the board starting
[19336.55s -> 19342.23s]  the bolt 52 we'll be able to become one of the most productive and secure cities in halcyon
[19342.79s -> 19349.98s]  and you'll have a powerful ally on the board farmers only dot what is that
[19350.86s -> 19359.90s]  i think i wait is this bolt sounds useful why one of the strongest defenses in halcyon
[19359.90s -> 19368.74s]  that's the farmer dating website all right where do i get a bolt in the old arms building southwest
[19368.74s -> 19374.66s]  of town which used to be part of stellar bay before we had to move our walls in these days
[19375.22s -> 19382.55s]  overrun with marauders and raptidons oh why you saying saying what which way
[19384.31s -> 19389.11s]  arms you're saying arms instead of arms that's just what it's called it's supposed to stand for
[19389.11s -> 19395.26s]  something but i forget what why am i such a weirdo why do i care about some of these things
[19396.06s -> 19407.77s]  i'll see what i can do good enough i know when to settle oh and while you're at it there should
[19407.77s -> 19413.37s]  be a terminal in the arms building with some dangerous information perhaps you could delete
[19413.37s -> 19425.94s]  it so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands you want me to wipe your hard drive all right
[19425.94s -> 19436.22s]  what do we got i want to wait family man okay here we go i still need to do this a fine day
[19436.22s -> 19443.67s]  for business isn't it anyway what can i do for you isaac rose is dead i found the people who
[19443.67s -> 19451.51s]  killed him but that's terrible what happened i've taken care of it killers are dead but that means
[19451.51s -> 19456.63s]  we won't be able to log their testimonies if there's one thing i've been hoping to
[19456.63s -> 19460.95s]  reestablish in stellar bay it's proper documentation for legal matters
[19463.56s -> 19466.36s]  uh sometimes you take matters into your own hands maybe i could have gotten their
[19466.36s -> 19471.08s]  statements if they hadn't been ready to kill me always a shame when tempers get the better of
[19471.08s -> 19478.04s]  good sense still your intervention in the matter is much appreciated please consider this payment
[19478.04s -> 19497.62s]  for your services okay goodbye let me take a look 40 is tinkering costs minus 50 that's pretty
[19497.62s -> 19521.00s]  amazing these guys seem a lot less evil i don't know about that maybe no weapons sway for five
[19521.00s -> 19527.72s]  seconds after each kill that's pretty good ah what should i do though i think i'm just gonna
[19527.72s -> 19546.87s]  put it into medical yeah but here's the thing about lying i have 70 lie right now
[19548.02s -> 19557.42s]  nothing that i've done in the game so far has required more than 40 or 50 yeah this is dentistry
[19557.42s -> 19571.72s]  there we go 40 breakdown weapons and armor for 20 chance to attract a basic mod yeah let's just
[19571.72s -> 19583.64s]  we'll get that up to 40 i will get to 100 live eventually don't worry you're gonna stack it for
[19583.64s -> 19591.90s]  the end game oh i will don't worry we'll get it so there was something else i need to do family
[19591.90s -> 19598.89s]  matter look for tucker right i'm gonna do that and then radio free oh shit we're still on
[19599.93s -> 19607.90s]  faction quest we're still we haven't even done the main thing yet what is this kid all right
[19607.90s -> 19617.64s]  we're gonna go find this kid this is the simple truth we are all molecular machines the body is
[19617.64s -> 19628.94s]  a collection of atoms the mind is the consequence of so here's the deal i'll tell you
[19629.58s -> 19639.45s]  you ready for the deal hold on to your hat we're going to play this tomorrow not done yet
[19640.73s -> 19648.30s]  but we're gonna play tomorrow and at the end of tomorrow's stream we're going to see if this is
[19648.30s -> 19654.18s]  something that i'm going to continue playing on stream tomorrow is thanksgiving that's correct
[19657.08s -> 19670.04s]  all right hold on 368 do i have any fast travels no so because it's thanksgiving tomorrow
[19671.78s -> 19688.95s]  i probably am gonna start streaming a little bit later than usual so tomorrow will probably be a
[19688.95s -> 19696.79s]  later stream instead of starting at like one or two we'll probably start not that much later
[19696.79s -> 19705.10s]  but just late enough where if everyone had things to do it'll be a later night stream
[19705.82s -> 19717.06s]  probably around like four pm pacific then it'll be about seven eastern and we can just chill
[19717.78s -> 19725.62s]  because it is fun just to kind of play a game even though you know i'm playing it
[19726.34s -> 19739.56s]  strangely i'm still enjoying it at least for now now here's the real question am i going to die
[19739.56s -> 19746.55s]  by attacking these hooligans no i won't even need to attack them because i can just run this way
[19756.04s -> 19759.24s]  stream title oh you better believe this the stream title tomorrow is going to be

[23170.81s -> 23197.74s]  all right this is tough yeah i mean it is i can't okay let me let me give you a little bit of an
[23197.74s -> 23208.46s]  example here i can't say i don't want to play this anymore but at the same time i can't tell you why
[23208.46s -> 23217.13s]  i am still playing you know i'm saying it's in that perfect spot of being just enjoyable enough
[23218.25s -> 23232.63s]  where i'm not going to turn it off i like the scenarios i like the i like the choices in the
[23232.63s -> 23252.38s]  scenarios and the easy to kill npcs that sounds fucked up but it's true it's good it's good
[23252.38s -> 23260.12s]  it's good and here's the thing i think that's all right you know what i mean i don't think it has to
[23260.12s -> 23274.01s]  be a fucking in perfect incredible video it's just it's good it's good sometimes what you're
[23274.01s -> 23289.77s]  all you're looking for is just something that's a good game now again i don't know how long this
[23289.85s -> 23305.35s]  game actually is but i feel like there's still a lot for me to do i'm assuming that did you
[23305.35s -> 23309.19s]  show you how many planets there were there's probably a bunch of stuff to do on every one
[23309.19s -> 23318.26s]  of those planets if you're just looking for a game with stuff to do in it this is for you
[23326.18s -> 23337.56s]  you're almost done what are you talking about how can it be almost done
[23341.94s -> 23359.06s]  oh we have to be careful all right here we go story is short oh well whatever all right get in there
[23373.34s -> 23391.02s]  run dead yeah somebody mentioned this it's almost like it's the halfway point
[23391.74s -> 23405.26s]  between borderlands and fallout but not more than halfway it's like they half developed borderlands
[23405.26s -> 23421.85s]  and half developed fallout buried near the surface of hayes grave is a small lock box its hinges
[23421.85s -> 23425.53s]  rusted through and it's wood almost completely rotted it nearly falls apart in your hands
[23426.97s -> 23437.64s]  and medallion bearing the letters sharon all right we got it but long story short
[23440.14s -> 23445.24s]  i think it's good i would say you'd probably like it if you played it was the best self-sacrificing
[23445.24s -> 23449.96s]  son of a saint i ever met maybe you wouldn't i don't know you've been watching it's up to you
[23449.96s -> 23454.12s]  now if we're gonna lure the manta queen out we'll need to find rebecca and danders
[23454.12s -> 23459.72s]  they took a udl contract on tera too we never heard from them again i think it's time i call
[23459.72s -> 23471.58s]  in a favor with hyrum if anyone can track them down it's him uh all right let's go we're almost
[23471.58s -> 23486.07s]  here it's way less action yeah it's good not better than good but good yes what do i feel
[23486.07s -> 23508.07s]  about the game no you guys already know how i feel about the game six out of ten
[23508.07s -> 23531.29s]  uh i think that's low i do not bad huh oh shit it's the bugs i know how to deal with the bugs
[23531.85s -> 23566.26s]  am i just missing over and over again this guy's juking me so hard oh good you're alive let's go
[23566.26s -> 23576.18s]  this way all right we need to start ascending germa can't formulate an opinion without seeing
[23576.82s -> 23588.20s]  reddit has to say first that's not even true what the fuck all right let's get in here
[23594.52s -> 23598.20s]  no i haven't formulated a full opinion because i'm playing halfway through the game
[23601.35s -> 23618.42s]  i have a slight opinion but i'm not done this fucking redditor over here oh shit you're
[23618.74s -> 23629.78s]  okay i thought that was a bandit
[23641.19s -> 23652.92s]  uh oh we pray at night we stop at night best character you want to try to tell me that you
[23652.92s -> 23660.36s]  don't think that's a good character now okay why there's too many of these queens
[23661.08s -> 23674.98s]  this is death if i try to fight these things oh fuck i didn't know you were there just it's all
[23674.98s -> 23682.58s]  of them oh man we have to fight it we have to fight we have to fight it we have to fight it we
[23682.58s -> 23740.39s]  have to die there's so many people ow the shock good on you i said it does more damage it does
[23740.39s -> 23748.36s]  more damage it does more damage just run and there's bugs and shit flying ants whatever the
[23748.36s -> 23794.86s]  hell they are all right super gun there should have been the head are you healing why won't you
[23794.86s -> 23822.79s]  just die fuck die after too many encounters with manta paulers and minusors you're not quite
[23822.79s -> 23831.18s]  yourself when any of the manta family of creatures are attacking you dexterity minus one minus one
[23831.18s -> 23837.75s]  minus one when you're surrounded by them that's worth it i don't care i'm scared of giant monsters
[23837.75s -> 23845.10s]  wow that's so strange how odd to be terrified of something that's five times bigger than you and
[23845.10s -> 23877.02s]  has claws like a lobster okay i get a free perk uh max meter maybe the armor rating walk speed
[23880.42s -> 23894.18s]  ultra beater what are you talking about what does that mean movement penalty accuracy uh walk speed
[23895.22s -> 23915.54s]  is good in combat i'll take it you're right my fucking god this sucks how much damage
[23915.94s -> 23926.22s]  okay what do i have for weapons this is like fire fire normal normal do i have anything else
[23926.22s -> 23940.81s]  what about this but like what about shock let me try like electric shock damage well that's
[23940.81s -> 23969.38s]  awful four and they're already dead they're both dead this is wonderful all i have is fire weapons
[23969.38s -> 23989.42s]  versus fire type is there a water type no don't run away and get all your energy back oh that's
[23989.42s -> 23999.35s]  so i'm clearly behind you i'm not gonna run away from me

[24661.75s -> 24670.74s]  by marauder and you been lugging a stranger into my station you could use the socialization you

[24701.58s -> 24707.02s]  and since my hired hands have clearly turned idle it appears i need you to clear out the threat
[24707.02s -> 24714.97s]  as my newest contractor you may call me the broker or we can call you hyrum on account
[24714.97s -> 24719.85s]  of that's your damn name and doubly on the account of the broker being a dumbass alternative
[24725.70s -> 24733.50s]  no emotion me you're here and your the feed's gone grainy but it looks like you're packing
[24733.50s -> 24741.66s]  deadly force i've barricaded the broadcast center but i can only hold out for so long
[24743.10s -> 24745.42s]  you double the going rate that's okay easy

[24983.67s -> 24994.74s]  my weapons suck i have to repair my weapons that's the problem why did you just moonwalk out there to
[24994.74s -> 25017.21s]  die what i don't don't know what that was for all right these some of these are missing because the
[25017.21s -> 25034.55s]  gun's broken that has to be what's going on is that it and maybe equip some armor that's asking
[25034.55s -> 25052.68s]  too much you're not going to show yourself dude your pattern is so fucking weird it's freaking me

[25117.42s -> 25154.95s]  key card now let's make our way cavern points 100 i have 112 line jesus i don't know why i
[25154.95s -> 25171.86s]  thought there wasn't gonna be anybody in here what happened to shaving streams this week
[25172.58s -> 25180.01s]  uh i really made mainly meant yesterday and tomorrow tomorrow is gonna be uh probably like
[25180.01s -> 25201.35s]  four or five hours yesterday was like four and a half so open the door hello never thought i'd
[25201.35s -> 25206.95s]  be ecstatic at having the walls painted in blood but seeing as it's not mine i'd say this calls
[25206.95s -> 25213.67s]  for a celebration this ought to square our debt one hefty payment for a highly valued service
[25214.31s -> 25221.27s]  but i admit i do wonder why neoka has brought you to me allow me to pose my question in another
[25221.27s -> 25235.21s]  manner why in the nebula are you here um you know why i'm here can we continue our conversations
[25235.21s -> 25241.29s]  from the intercom if you insist as i was telling you before i am the premier broker for all of
[25241.29s -> 25247.05s]  monarch phineas must have sent you he's the only one insane enough to send someone to monarch to
[25247.05s -> 25254.01s]  rush me i knew it was only a matter of time before he came a knocking look might be late
[25254.01s -> 25261.48s]  but i fulfill my contracts always oh you do do you i have lost track of the number of beers you
[25261.48s -> 25267.80s]  owe me for chasing raptidons off your stoop careful i know that line i use it all the time
[25268.84s -> 25278.39s]  i take offense to that look okay just it might take me a while this time i don't care caring or
[25278.55s -> 25283.30s]  not won't change the facts of the matter i am awaiting but a single incoming transmission
[25283.30s -> 25288.90s]  containing the information we desire but msi and the iconoclasts are clogging the airwaves
[25288.90s -> 25292.90s]  from stellar bay and amber heights and they're screaming voice yeah they're scrambling each
[25292.90s -> 25301.77s]  other's once this is completed i'm taking off this is a problem okay so we kick them off get
[25301.77s -> 25305.77s]  them out of here exactly what i was thinking wait they hurt us all with their pettiness who is he
[25305.77s -> 25309.85s]  talking about of course has inadvertently affected the incoming port and my livelihood
[25315.72s -> 25320.84s]  where in stellar bay my former partner sanjar transmits from his office in msi's headquarters
[25320.84s -> 25327.08s]  in the center of town don't let him try to fool you while his messages might seem like gibberish
[25327.08s -> 25333.40s]  they are in reality coded business orders to off-world companies i understand why he needs
[25333.40s -> 25340.28s]  the bandwidth but we had a deal and he's broadcasting ceaselessly i kind of like that guy though
[25344.98s -> 25348.50s]  no they're jamming the limited frequencies we have at our disposal
[25348.50s -> 25352.50s]  nothing extra planetary can get in or out until the frequency pollution thins out
[25353.30s -> 25358.58s]  the safest thing is to convince graham and sanjar to start transmitting on their end
[25360.34s -> 25368.71s]  i could just kill them all i'll talk some sense to that i'll be here waiting on the receiving end
[25369.59s -> 25374.39s]  luck be with you i have a feeling you'll be needing a pinch of it plus a vat of patience
[25376.42s -> 25380.82s]  uh we need a favor oh great i love doing pro bono work for friends
[25381.70s -> 25388.42s]  oh you called us friends i'd normally entertain yourself aggrandizing delusions but this time
[25388.42s -> 25394.98s]  it's important important to you is not the same as important to me although i do recognize that you
[25395.70s -> 25399.86s]  may have earned some goodwill this guy's boring the fuck out of me once laboring for me
[25399.86s -> 25409.78s]  me whoa hey there is zero yeah just do it now hurry up look i'll do what i can all right
[25410.42s -> 25415.80s]  rebecca hodges and anders watsworth they took a udl contract back when monarch went to shit
[25415.80s -> 25422.20s]  and i need to find them i believed them to be on terra too if udl hired two hunters back then
[25422.20s -> 25425.96s]  it would have been for creature clearing purposes round one of their spacers choice outposts
[25427.00s -> 25431.08s]  these are the coordinates for the outpost under the last udl contract now scram
[25431.96s -> 25440.18s]  and uh good luck say scram all right goodbye neoka pick me up some stimuli lotion and a bottle of
[25440.18s -> 25449.64s]  purple berry wine when you're next in stellar bay all right so whatever he said i don't know
[25449.64s -> 25467.13s]  whatever it was uh we'll find out tomorrow i'll take all this stuff that's a flamethrower okay
[25468.17s -> 25476.02s]  uh so we're gonna continue tomorrow and we will see if the stream tomorrow is going to continue
[25477.62s -> 25486.68s]  i might be able just to beat it tomorrow it's possible if i'm like halfway more than halfway
[25486.68s -> 25491.69s]  through the game it's possible but i'm probably i'm probably gonna be streaming for about four or
[25491.69s -> 25507.13s]  five hours maybe we'll see i'm probably not even close because i streamed this yesterday for like
[25507.13s -> 25510.09s]  four and a half hours and i'm probably only gonna stream tomorrow for like four or five hours
[25510.97s -> 25521.85s]  this is the one in the middle like today yeah uh yeah i was gonna stop like a couple hours ago
[25521.85s -> 25542.15s]  but i was getting into it i'm just getting kind of tired you're into the dentist cosplay
[25544.31s -> 25549.11s]  yeah we'll see if i continue it at least some of the because i really probably should just put on
[25549.11s -> 25555.35s]  like a real armor we'll see all right but that's uh that's it for today thanks for watching guys
[25555.35s -> 25567.75s]  we'll see you tomorrow and we'll see what happens at the end of that stream any news on the green
[25567.75s -> 25574.20s]  screen yeah the discord channel is open there's a discord channel talked about yesterday i think
[25575.26s -> 25582.57s]  uh for suggestions and actions that stream is going to happen somewhere probably december 10th
[25582.57s -> 25591.32s]  11th maybe 12th please put your favorite actions there and discuss them if i do not see tomorrow
[25591.32s -> 25596.26s]  happy thanksgiving those of you that celebrate it and if uh by the way stream is probably going
[25596.26s -> 25604.78s]  to start a little bit later just to kind of stream after most people do their thanksgiving
[25604.78s -> 25615.06s]  festivities so the stream tomorrow will be about 4 pm pacific channel is not open is it not well
[25615.06s -> 25626.06s]  it will be it will be very soon like within the next hour probably oh god all right there we go
[25626.70s -> 25634.47s]  jacket's on the case but yeah uh i will see you guys tomorrow we'll keep going let me just do a
[25634.47s -> 25643.74s]  hard save just in case and we'll move on to bits i'll see you guys soon happy thanksgiving maybe
[25643.74s -> 25668.78s]  we'll see you tomorrow that's the end let us rewind the clock to earlier does it work no no
[25669.34s -> 25681.77s]  i have to check it every time thank you peaceful hailey for the 250 bits germa how are you hope
[25681.77s -> 25689.50s]  you enjoy outer worlds it's a very fun game a bit short but fun i think it's good like i said earlier
[25689.50s -> 25706.33s]  it's just it's good enough for me to want to play i think it's interesting enough i will hold final
[25706.33s -> 25717.45s]  judgments until i either finish it or get real close but somebody said six out of ten i think
[25717.45s -> 25730.39s]  that's low i do think it's higher than that also uh i got fallen order and i highly recommend you
[25730.39s -> 25741.64s]  play it if you haven't already have a good night i don't know if you'll see fallen order on stream
[25742.28s -> 25764.39s]  depends on how uh how much room there is for content and by content i mean how much room there
[25764.39s -> 25775.27s]  is for uh somebody said good good i've heard it as oh it's like dark souls and i don't know maybe
[25775.99s -> 25783.98s]  i would probably just do that on my own time but i said that about god of war and i got like halfway
[25783.98s -> 25790.52s]  through god of war and i stopped playing it so that's part of the reason why i don't play that
[25790.52s -> 25798.46s]  many triple a single player games is because a lot of them are long and i lose interest pretty
[25798.46s -> 25806.94s]  quickly if i sit there and play a game for 12 15 20 plus hours usually it has to be really has to
[25806.94s -> 25819.37s]  grab me completely or i'm just gonna stop slowly playing it but we'll see i haven't there's gonna
[25819.37s -> 25826.14s]  be a lull in content here uh once all these new games come out that's sort of no man's land of
[25826.22s -> 25835.80s]  january into february not a whole lot of shit comes out so we'll see oh okay i see what you're
[25835.80s -> 25847.06s]  doing right but thank you i have heard it's sort of interesting thank you gnarly for the 250 i

[26026.78s -> 26031.42s]  some streams from there it's mostly metroid prime that needs streaming but some megaman battle
[26031.42s -> 26036.38s]  network needs attention too i don't have many bits but i can give you some pro tips as a reward
[26036.38s -> 26055.94s]  i'm sure you can use them what happened megaman battle network that's something i have not heard

[26160.54s -> 26164.62s]  friends and my mother and my dog are dying is there anything you do or think that helps you
[26164.62s -> 26181.30s]  through tough times well that's fucking horrible that sounds absolutely terrible damn that's it
[26181.30s -> 26194.58s]  that's heavy that's a heavy load there um seriously take care of yourself if there's anything that
[26194.58s -> 26208.87s]  anything you do you think that helps you through tough times honestly for me at least and this is
[26208.87s -> 26215.75s]  obviously not any professional opinion or anything which i would implore anybody and everybody to do
[26216.55s -> 26221.75s]  if you think the weight of the world is too much and you're going through too much shit
[26223.37s -> 26237.50s]  please contact somebody that is capable of being able to help you through that but for me i can't
[26237.50s -> 26243.50s]  it's for i'll give you just a perfect example of recent right recently i've been having a this is
[26243.50s -> 26251.30s]  definitely obviously not even close to a ton of of the issues that you're describing but just in
[26251.30s -> 26257.75s]  general talking about what helps you through like tough times right so i've had this medical problem
[26257.75s -> 26260.31s]  that i can't figure out it's been something i've been trying to figure out for like a year
[26261.29s -> 26267.37s]  off and on it's just been there it's been annoying it's been irritating and it's almost like you have
[26267.37s -> 26276.90s]  to look at a telescope in like a year a couple of years into the future and at the end you're
[26276.90s -> 26281.46s]  hoping that as time goes along you'll figure out what's going on you can deal with the problems
[26281.46s -> 26290.71s]  that you have so for me i try not to focus on the exact moment that's happening and i try to focus
[26290.71s -> 26305.16s]  on what's potentially going to be the solution in the future day to day essentially and like jacket
[26305.16s -> 26315.18s]  just said therapy is cool if you need it use it please use it yes for me to tell you these things
[26316.06s -> 26324.23s]  is not the equivalent of somebody who is equipped and qualified to help take care of some of the
[26324.23s -> 26331.02s]  issues you're going through if you're going through shit if you having horrible problems and if shit's
[26331.02s -> 26344.02s]  not looking good get some help there's nothing wrong with it there's absolutely nothing wrong
[26344.02s -> 26359.59s]  with taking care of yourself that's kind of how i think about it i go to therapy every week trust
[26359.59s -> 26378.28s]  me it helps so much yeah i'm glad to hear that i wish you the best i know it's um you know easy
[26378.28s -> 26383.48s]  for me to say hey i wish you the best right but i really do i really do hope that you can figure out
[26386.65s -> 26404.52s]  all that because that sounds like a lot sub chat sometimes is wholesome yeah it's nice to just hang
[26404.52s -> 26413.38s]  on and talk about random stuff because the stream is just kind of streams over right now right and
[26413.38s -> 26435.62s]  this is just kind of the the post we just chill i like it but yeah you are number one you you always
[26435.62s -> 26445.18s]  should try to be taking care of yourself as best you can and however that means for you to get it
[26445.18s -> 26457.62s]  to take the steps necessary to do that you have to take them slowly any prospects on bald coin i'm
[26457.62s -> 26465.75s]  holding up for a rally this holiday season um bald coin went to zero there are no exchanges
[26465.75s -> 26474.54s]  that even traded it has been delisted from every exchange and there was a one million coin supply
[26475.10s -> 26489.83s]  and i burnt 999 000 of them i'm sorry so therefore i put so much money into that

[26509.11s -> 26514.63s]  thing takes a shitload of money from people at the very end they always say thank you for
[26515.43s -> 26530.47s]  doing this journey with me what the fuck are you talking about it's not a journey you took my
[26530.55s -> 26547.34s]  money and spent it yeah your journey your journey going to the the outie dealership
[26550.33s -> 26563.72s]  and then the journey driving back to your garage it's always so interesting though

[26646.57s -> 26650.89s]  catch some streams whenever i get the chance to stream the perfect way to relax thanks for the
[26650.89s -> 26660.09s]  past many years in the years ahead of us thank you medhi it's sometimes weird to think about
[26660.09s -> 26664.76s]  that i've been doing this for so long that people that may have been watching the channel

[26973.61s -> 26980.71s]  i don't make them i don't even use twitter i i painstakingly open this thing to like write
[26980.71s -> 26991.45s]  about a stream that i'm about to start doing my last two real tweets was a picture that i took
[26991.45s -> 27005.80s]  at twitchcon and then two months later telling you i'm not at twitchcon anymore it doesn't even
[27005.80s -> 27021.35s]  have an auto setup no i don't trust the fucking robots anyways i'll see you guys tomorrow have a

[27030.47s -> 27040.15s]  before i go there are people that tweet like five ten fifteen times a day i couldn't even think i
[27040.15s -> 27044.79s]  can't even think of one thing to write to you guys a week it's like what am i how do i do that
[27045.43s -> 27056.70s]  for me to write more than five to ten tweets a day i'd have to tell you about my bowel movements
[27057.34s -> 27075.96s]  well that was a good one i feel nice and uh relieved you know if somebody gave me a challenge
[27075.96s -> 27081.88s]  to tweet 10 times a day and they had to be you couldn't just write like a b c d e f g a delete
[27081.88s -> 27086.44s]  you could just do the alphabet 10 times like actually write 10 tweets over the course of a
[27086.44s -> 27112.17s]  day that would be very hard for me to do i did miss one bit yeah i did from smelly boy thank you
[27112.17s -> 27116.89s]  smelly boy for the 250 this game looks very neat also during thanksgiving dinner do you
[27116.89s -> 27121.29s]  prefer your cranberry sauce to be the stuff that has actual cranberries in it or just the big
[27121.29s -> 27130.97s]  fucking jelly slab i'm a jelly slab type of dude myself uh i will take it both ways jelly slab
[27130.97s -> 27137.77s]  is good jelly slab is good to spread over the turkey because it's easy to do that but
[27138.49s -> 27144.42s]  the cram with the cranberry chunks in it i kind of like putting that in my mashed potatoes just
[27144.42s -> 27148.66s]  like a little dollop of it so it's in the center and you go in and grab a little bit of chunks of
[27148.66s -> 27157.56s]  the it gives some the mashed potatoes a little bit more it can be incredibly it's very versatile
[27162.04s -> 27169.69s]  jelly slab makes a great sandwich they all do put it on the mash um i don't think of that
[27170.78s -> 27174.84s]  thanksgiving dinner it doesn't matter where it is just put everything on the plate and just
[27174.84s -> 27179.40s]  mush it up and mix it around spin your fork around in a circle it's still going to be great
[27180.12s -> 27196.33s]  put it on the ground then all right guys i'll see you tomorrow we're going to see how far we get in
[27196.33s -> 27204.79s]  um out of worlds like i said at the end of that stream we will we will have a meeting of the
[27204.79s -> 27210.94s]  dentists to find out if it's something that i want to keep doing if not we'll move on to something
[27214.31s -> 27217.03s]  again tomorrow stream i know i'm saying that it might be short
[27218.89s -> 27229.96s]  but it probably will be because at this like i know it's thanksgiving and i'm not doing like
[27229.96s -> 27237.21s]  thanksgiving on thanksgiving but there's also some stuff going on that i might have to do i got to
[27237.77s -> 27244.33s]  make around a phone calls that day and i want to talk to my parents and shit for a while so i mean
[27244.33s -> 27247.69s]  when i talked to my mother on holidays i talked to her usually for like an hour or two
[27250.39s -> 27258.95s]  we'll see we'll see i want to make sure i get it all done but well i'll see you tomorrow remember
