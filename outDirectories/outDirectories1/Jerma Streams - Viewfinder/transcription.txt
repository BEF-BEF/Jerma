[8.06s -> 9.74s]  What he said, the lame title.
[11.26s -> 14.10s]  Well, I'm retired now, so I don't have to worry about that anymore.
[17.82s -> 18.32s]  How's it going?
[24.47s -> 25.55s]  You're gonna play armored core.
[25.99s -> 26.49s]  Yeah.
[26.63s -> 33.47s]  We need to talk about armored core because, uh, I have some, I have some
[33.47s -> 41.48s]  thoughts, I have a few thoughts I've heard.
[43.38s -> 46.46s]  Uh, I've heard it's very, very, very difficult.
[47.48s -> 50.84s]  I've heard it has a very, very large learning curve.
[53.22s -> 62.30s]  And I mean, I would be jumping into, uh, return to the Jedi without watching
[62.46s -> 63.94s]  any of the other star Wars movies.
[64.90s -> 74.06s]  So, I don't know, maybe this is not true.
[76.71s -> 77.59s]  I heard it was really hard.
[78.53s -> 79.97s]  I heard it was okay.
[80.65s -> 84.33s]  Here's what I heard is that I love from software.
[84.53s -> 85.41s]  I love dark souls.
[85.45s -> 86.29s]  I love Elden ring.
[86.37s -> 87.09s]  Oh, yay.
[87.09s -> 88.49s]  Here comes another from software game.
[88.49s -> 91.25s]  It's just, this is not Elden ring, dude.
[91.33s -> 92.21s]  This is a different game.
[92.73s -> 94.57s]  This is a completely different experience.
[102.91s -> 103.55s]  How about this?
[104.78s -> 106.06s]  I'll maybe I'll open it.
[106.30s -> 107.10s]  I'll try it.
[108.30s -> 112.98s]  But if it's clear that I'm just like completely have no idea what I'm doing.
[113.78s -> 116.54s]  And it's just like, Oh, I'm having, I'm having a lot of trouble.
[118.24s -> 120.40s]  And we might just move away to something else that day.
[122.58s -> 123.14s]  You'll love it.
[123.30s -> 124.46s]  I I'll give it a try.
[124.50s -> 125.00s]  I will.
[125.88s -> 130.39s]  But I've never played any of the armored core games, any of them.
[130.59s -> 132.03s]  I don't even know if I like this genre.
[137.41s -> 141.93s]  You know, I'll try the new food, but I will be honest with you at the restaurant.
[142.69s -> 143.41s]  Oh, Hey, try this.
[143.41s -> 145.41s]  It's, it's got, um, cilantro.
[145.41s -> 146.73s]  It's got a, the squid in it.
[146.77s -> 149.77s]  And it's, um, it's got a potato mash on top.
[150.09s -> 152.17s]  I'll try it, but I'm going to tell you, I'll take a bite.
[152.17s -> 153.45s]  And I'm going to go, it's all right.
[153.49s -> 153.99s]  Not for me.
[155.01s -> 157.61s]  Or I might go, Oh, nice.
[159.29s -> 159.85s]  You know what I'm saying?
[160.01s -> 162.85s]  Like, I don't, I I'll try the new food, but I can't offer it.
[162.89s -> 164.01s]  I can't promise I will love it.
[168.42s -> 170.22s]  What kind of freak doesn't like robots?
[175.54s -> 176.74s]  I, I like robots.
[177.30s -> 179.82s]  I just don't know if I'm going to be good at playing as a robot.
[188.96s -> 193.16s]  Uh, but anyways, let's talk about the next, uh, week or so.
[194.60s -> 197.24s]  First of all, we're going to play viewfinder tonight.
[197.96s -> 198.46s]  Today.
[200.96s -> 204.64s]  I have a plan to play bouncing duck simulator.
[205.64s -> 208.80s]  If not today, then be on Monday or something.
[208.84s -> 209.34s]  We'll see.
[211.11s -> 215.35s]  Also at the end of this coming week, I want to continue sorcery part four.
[217.74s -> 219.86s]  And I will try.
[220.96s -> 226.84s]  Uh, I almost just said assassin's creed six armored core six.
[232.21s -> 234.33s]  That's the plan for this coming week.
[234.81s -> 238.73s]  Probably streaming and streaming today, streaming Monday, and then probably on
[238.73s -> 246.21s]  like Saturday, Sunday, maybe like Sunday this coming weekend, but for today, let's
[246.21s -> 251.34s]  play viewfinder of a Hilux two.
[252.66s -> 256.74s]  Yeah, I know.
[260.93s -> 262.81s]  We have to play the assassin's creed now.
[266.70s -> 268.66s]  He's never going to play Hilux.
[270.15s -> 271.39s]  I definitely will.
[276.34s -> 277.38s]  What about mine?
[277.38s -> 277.88s]  Quack.
[280.60s -> 281.36s]  I don't think so.
[284.05s -> 286.21s]  What about the Smurf cosplay stream?
[291.23s -> 293.47s]  I never said I was doing a Smurfs cosplay.
[295.50s -> 296.74s]  When are you going to reveal your balding?
[297.34s -> 302.18s]  Um, somebody in pre-stream chat said, Oh, Hey dude, like have you started balding?
[302.82s -> 306.54s]  And I was in the middle of typing reply to this person, but I stopped.
[307.10s -> 307.98s]  And I deleted it all.
[308.02s -> 314.70s]  I deleted everything because I'm not going to even talk about that because you know
[314.70s -> 314.94s]  what I mean?
[314.94s -> 320.62s]  Like I, I'm not going to type or, or, or address like anything about me, my hair,
[320.66s -> 321.58s]  my balding or anything.
[321.90s -> 322.94s]  I'm not even going to talk about it.
[323.82s -> 324.38s]  You know what I'm saying?
[324.46s -> 325.26s]  Do you know what I mean by that?
[325.26s -> 329.94s]  Like, I'm not going to even start talking about that because I'm not, I
[329.94s -> 330.94s]  ain't manifesting anything.
[332.05s -> 336.01s]  So I am going to, uh, have no comment on that.
[340.26s -> 341.22s]  I, my hair is great.
[342.06s -> 343.78s]  I'm not making any comments besides that.
[344.34s -> 346.78s]  I've, I've got, I've got pretty good hair right now.
[347.26s -> 361.54s]  The only comment I'm going to make, you address it constantly.
[362.82s -> 366.38s]  Yeah, but I address it jokingly constantly.
[367.67s -> 371.75s]  It was a, that was a real question in pre-stream and I was like, Oh yeah, well
[371.75s -> 372.43s]  here's the thing, man.
[372.43s -> 374.11s]  Like, let me tell you about, no, no, no, no.
[374.11s -> 376.59s]  I'm not going to, I'm not going to sincerely address it.
[376.67s -> 377.19s]  No way.
[379.29s -> 381.17s]  How many hotdogs do you think you could eat in 45 seconds?
[381.17s -> 381.53s]  Let me think.
[383.07s -> 388.86s]  Probably two, maybe, maybe full one.
[389.74s -> 390.14s]  I don't know.
[390.46s -> 391.02s]  I've never tried.
[393.58s -> 400.42s]  I would say one, one sounds like fine, maybe, but that's not something that I
[400.42s -> 402.06s]  something, that's not something I would recommend trying.
[403.83s -> 404.07s]  Yeah.
[404.11s -> 410.62s]  Uh, how about this?
[411.42s -> 412.46s]  How, how long do I have?
[413.82s -> 414.62s]  All right, give me a number.
[414.62s -> 420.01s]  Give me like 10 minutes or like, what's like the, um, how long in a hotdog
[420.01s -> 423.65s]  competition do you have to eat all the hotdogs that are out there?
[424.73s -> 426.85s]  What's like a typical hotdog competition timer?
[430.70s -> 434.48s]  10 minutes, 30 minutes.
[436.30s -> 436.58s]  Okay.
[437.18s -> 440.54s]  Uh, I would eat one over the course of 30 minutes and I would eat it with a
[440.54s -> 442.38s]  fork and knife during the competition.
[445.58s -> 446.98s]  Be like, here we go, everybody.
[446.98s -> 448.50s]  Welcome to the hotdog contest.
[448.50s -> 449.26s]  Let's go.
[450.22s -> 452.62s]  Three, two, one.
[452.66s -> 458.14s]  Let's fucking, everyone's freaking out and I just slowly take one and just
[458.14s -> 463.82s]  start cutting the end off and choosing which dipping sauce I'm going to put it
[463.82s -> 463.94s]  in.
[464.82s -> 465.74s]  No, that's what I'll do first.
[466.50s -> 470.22s]  I will make sure that, that there's 10 different dipping sauces and I slowly
[470.22s -> 475.84s]  make a little pool on the plate with each one and I will like make, oh,
[475.88s -> 478.08s]  exquisite faces every time I take a bite.
[482.26s -> 483.50s]  That was a Malcolm in the Middle joke.
[483.70s -> 484.26s]  That's a good one.
[484.82s -> 486.10s]  That's a, what a, that's a good episode.
[486.14s -> 486.50s]  That's real.
[488.43s -> 490.71s]  That was Malcolm in the, all right.
[490.71s -> 492.47s]  Well then, yeah, it's a, that's, that's a funny joke.
[492.47s -> 492.95s]  I like it.
[493.87s -> 494.91s]  I should watch that episode.
[504.43s -> 507.19s]  I don't think they even have dipping sauces past the water jug.
[518.07s -> 521.23s]  Once I get my headphones, it's over for you hoes.
[521.27s -> 523.23s]  I don't know how yet, but it will be.
[525.72s -> 526.88s]  What are you talking about?
[534.33s -> 537.37s]  That person is really excited to get a new pair of headphones.
[539.56s -> 544.28s]  And I'll tell you, I've been there before where you're just like, oh man, I'm going
[544.28s -> 546.64s]  to be powered up once I get this new thing.
[550.38s -> 552.94s]  You ever get, you ever just feel like completely energized.
[553.18s -> 554.38s]  There's like a new thing coming up.
[558.47s -> 560.35s]  Soft retirement, soft hair loss.
[560.39s -> 561.51s]  Do not out.
[561.99s -> 563.27s]  I actually want you to time that person out.
[563.87s -> 567.83s]  I don't want that message to be like recorded into history.
[568.55s -> 571.27s]  I want that message deleted because I don't want to manifest that.
[571.67s -> 572.63s]  I want that to be deleted.
[575.65s -> 576.45s]  And then here it comes here.
[576.65s -> 577.25s]  Everybody say it.
[577.29s -> 577.77s]  Here it comes.
[587.10s -> 588.18s]  I'm doing just fine.
[588.22s -> 588.98s]  I'm doing all right.
[589.74s -> 591.30s]  Manifest some fucking hair.
[592.43s -> 594.35s]  Yeah, it's luscious right now.
[594.39s -> 598.19s]  I've been manifesting it since I've been drinking green tea since I was fucking
[598.19s -> 598.87s]  19.
[598.87s -> 599.31s]  All right.
[602.51s -> 603.67s]  That's how you manifested.
[613.90s -> 616.38s]  Can I have your comb when you're finally gone?
[619.14s -> 620.34s]  Oh, that's gone in the museum somewhere.
[631.06s -> 631.94s]  Such like an ego.
[632.34s -> 633.50s]  That's such egomania.
[633.78s -> 634.14s]  I know.
[637.58s -> 637.90s]  All right.
[638.14s -> 643.18s]  If you wanted to see like the signup sheet or the museum of history of
[643.50s -> 648.30s]  entertainment history, I would bet out of all the things in that museum.
[648.78s -> 655.22s]  The German nine, eight, five comb in the glass gets the least amount of signups
[655.38s -> 666.06s]  for that part of the tour that they may, they might even have to move it to a
[666.06s -> 666.50s]  different room.
[666.50s -> 670.14s]  Eventually, you know, that's going to get moved three or four times before it just
[670.14s -> 670.82s]  gets put in storage.
[671.70s -> 675.10s]  And then I get a call asking for me to come get it.
[688.24s -> 688.48s]  All right.
[688.48s -> 688.96s]  You guys ready?
[689.24s -> 690.36s]  Uh, no more Stalin.
[696.66s -> 698.34s]  I'll put the baseball on display.
[699.91s -> 700.59s]  Oh, they will not.
[702.00s -> 703.40s]  Don't you have a copy of your face?
[703.44s -> 703.76s]  Yes.
[706.81s -> 707.89s]  And I don't like it at all.
[712.10s -> 712.34s]  Okay.
[712.70s -> 718.23s]  The reason why this thing is weird is because there's constantly a mirror when
[718.23s -> 723.34s]  there is no mirror, we all know, looking in the mirror, you see your face, being
[723.34s -> 730.50s]  able to see your face when there is no mirror is some, I honestly, I put a towel
[730.50s -> 738.82s]  over it, but I don't want to see it.
[738.82s -> 739.30s]  It's weird.
[750.22s -> 751.34s]  You laugh like a gnome.
[751.62s -> 752.06s]  That's fine.
[752.66s -> 753.14s]  It's kind of cool.
[760.26s -> 760.62s]  Show it.
[761.46s -> 761.62s]  No.
[763.06s -> 763.58s]  I don't even have it.
[764.26s -> 764.62s]  I lied.
[764.62s -> 765.10s]  I don't even have it.
[765.10s -> 765.58s]  It's not even here.
[774.28s -> 776.32s]  Turn on face cam one and just have it be the mold.
[776.68s -> 777.88s]  Now that would be really funny.
[778.48s -> 784.58s]  Except the problem with that is somebody would like, would like get it and like
[784.58s -> 789.14s]  zoom in and like with AI generated fucking knowledge, it would hit every
[789.14s -> 790.30s]  single point and they'd be able to make one.
[792.74s -> 793.50s]  You can do that now.
[794.58s -> 795.14s]  Oh, nevermind.
[795.18s -> 795.54s]  Who cares?
[809.29s -> 810.45s]  You should sell it or something.
[810.77s -> 812.57s]  No, that's very weird.
[817.51s -> 819.03s]  He's obsessed with himself.
[825.19s -> 825.59s]  All right.
[825.59s -> 826.39s]  Let's go.
[826.39s -> 826.99s]  Let's go.
[826.99s -> 827.59s]  Let's go.
[827.59s -> 828.19s]  Let's go.
[828.19s -> 829.31s]  Let's go.
[833.38s -> 836.86s]  You should sell it, but attach it to a life-size stretch Armstrong.
[839.41s -> 839.81s]  No.
[842.56s -> 847.56s]  Hey, speaking of things that are going on sale soon, uh, on 28th and a couple
[847.56s -> 853.86s]  of days, as YouTube is going up, it's not my, a mold of my face, but that,
[853.86s -> 855.14s]  that is my likeness.
[856.74s -> 857.26s]  Pretty cool.
[861.90s -> 862.10s]  All right.
[862.10s -> 863.92s]  Let's play bro.
[863.92s -> 864.56s]  Play the game.
[864.68s -> 865.72s]  I'm, I'm just chilling.
[865.72s -> 878.34s]  Relax, bro.
[878.34s -> 879.14s]  Don't play the game.
[879.70s -> 880.82s]  I won't.
[881.22s -> 881.90s]  I relax.
[881.90s -> 882.70s]  I I'm not gonna.
[886.30s -> 886.54s]  Okay.
[887.18s -> 887.98s]  Uh, let's do it.
[888.58s -> 889.38s]  I'm gonna move over here.
[892.26s -> 893.74s]  You should be able to hear the game now.
[895.95s -> 896.75s]  Viewfinder.
[896.95s -> 901.87s]  If you guys remember that we played this during the demo demo, whatever
[901.87s -> 912.39s]  it was, the steam demo thing, whatever it was, it was fun.
[912.95s -> 915.91s]  It's a game where you take pictures and the pictures become part of
[915.91s -> 917.23s]  the world that you can place.
[917.94s -> 918.98s]  It was very fun.
[919.80s -> 922.08s]  And let's, uh, let's freaking go.
[926.03s -> 926.23s]  Right.
[926.79s -> 929.07s]  We're in time to explore.
[932.18s -> 932.66s]  You'll get it.
[932.66s -> 934.14s]  If you don't get it very soon here.
[935.81s -> 936.37s]  How's the audio?
[936.37s -> 936.77s]  Is it good?
[940.85s -> 942.09s]  When are you going to finish breath of the wild?
[946.84s -> 947.28s]  You know what?
[948.40s -> 948.72s]  I will.
[957.31s -> 957.83s]  It's not right now.
[961.48s -> 962.08s]  Is there a sprint?
[962.08s -> 962.52s]  I don't remember.
[962.52s -> 963.16s]  I don't think there is.
[965.10s -> 965.58s]  How's the audio.
[965.58s -> 966.06s]  Can you hear good?
[968.93s -> 970.69s]  I've seen this much overgrowth before.
[971.62s -> 973.50s]  It's okay.
[973.54s -> 975.78s]  I already, I did that before and it scared me again.
[978.60s -> 981.56s]  I guess we know now that falling doesn't hurt.
[982.46s -> 983.30s]  That's some good news.
[983.30s -> 983.82s]  At least.
[984.66s -> 985.22s]  Oh, that's right.
[985.22s -> 989.20s]  There's a rewind to get back up there.
[993.15s -> 993.71s]  That was sick.
[1003.62s -> 1004.14s]  Yeah.
[1004.18s -> 1005.66s]  It's a rewind time.
[1009.97s -> 1010.85s]  Should I say that every time?
[1011.09s -> 1015.02s]  What's an old photograph doing here and just hype it up for a full minute.
[1016.89s -> 1017.81s]  That's going to be so annoying.
[1017.81s -> 1021.25s]  If you're like a new viewer, this was like, shut the fuck up, dude.
[1021.25s -> 1022.09s]  And play, stop.
[1022.13s -> 1022.65s]  Just play.
[1022.69s -> 1024.25s]  Why do you have to do like this weird thing every time?
[1034.76s -> 1035.64s]  Can you do something with it?
[1035.84s -> 1036.32s]  Oh, that's right.
[1036.32s -> 1036.52s]  Okay.
[1036.52s -> 1037.60s]  I can place this over here.
[1038.04s -> 1038.64s]  So check this out.
[1038.92s -> 1039.36s]  Watch this.
[1040.90s -> 1041.30s]  Check this out.
[1041.30s -> 1041.62s]  You ready?
[1046.84s -> 1050.14s]  Did, did you just shift reality?
[1050.22s -> 1050.54s]  Let's go.
[1052.23s -> 1053.87s]  Put the phrase on a soundboard.
[1053.91s -> 1054.55s]  That's kind of funny.
[1054.59s -> 1054.79s]  All right.
[1054.79s -> 1055.07s]  Hold on.
[1057.61s -> 1058.13s]  What should I say?
[1059.11s -> 1061.82s]  Like rewind bros.
[1062.22s -> 1063.34s]  Can I get a countdown?
[1063.38s -> 1064.62s]  We're going into rewind.
[1064.66s -> 1065.54s]  Ah, I fucked it up.
[1065.54s -> 1065.78s]  Hold on.
[1068.89s -> 1069.61s]  Hey, I can't even do it.
[1069.65s -> 1069.93s]  Why not?
[1073.75s -> 1075.03s]  Why is my GoXLR fucked up?
[1075.07s -> 1075.67s]  I can't even do it.
[1076.88s -> 1077.88s]  I think that, I think it's broken.
[1077.88s -> 1078.20s]  I can't do it.
[1080.38s -> 1081.50s]  Oh, it was funny for like five seconds.
[1081.54s -> 1081.82s]  We got it.
[1084.27s -> 1084.43s]  All right.
[1084.43s -> 1084.95s]  The batteries.
[1084.95s -> 1085.63s]  I remember the batteries.
[1088.88s -> 1090.04s]  Have confidence in yourself.
[1092.73s -> 1093.13s]  Yeah.
[1093.17s -> 1097.73s]  You would, when you, when you do, when you do acting, if you do voice acting,
[1097.93s -> 1100.17s]  you're going to do a few takes sometimes.
[1101.20s -> 1102.84s]  You can't get it perfect every time.
[1105.14s -> 1106.30s]  That just means you're a bad actor.
[1106.42s -> 1106.82s]  That's fine.
[1109.08s -> 1109.36s]  Shut up.
[1115.02s -> 1115.42s]  Oh yeah.
[1115.42s -> 1116.74s]  Soft retirement stream.
[1116.74s -> 1117.42s]  Let's go.
[1119.94s -> 1122.50s]  No, I'm not going to talk about that every five seconds, by the way.
[1127.09s -> 1128.45s]  It's almost working.
[1128.81s -> 1129.33s]  We need one more.
[1129.33s -> 1130.29s]  Looks like we need one more.
[1135.27s -> 1136.71s]  Does this mean it works if it's black and white?
[1141.97s -> 1142.41s]  Cool.
[1144.16s -> 1145.20s]  Hey, can you say hi to my cat?
[1146.06s -> 1146.38s]  Yeah.
[1146.70s -> 1154.06s]  Um, come here.
[1156.10s -> 1156.46s]  They work.
[1162.45s -> 1162.89s]  Hmm.
[1163.57s -> 1165.77s]  That doesn't look right.
[1165.81s -> 1167.29s]  Oh, you know what I'm going to have to do?
[1175.42s -> 1176.90s]  This is just the tutorial.
[1177.64s -> 1178.28s]  We're good.
[1184.30s -> 1186.18s]  Is it true that you're moving into a nursing home?
[1191.34s -> 1195.62s]  I have an, I have an idea or I, you know what?
[1195.66s -> 1197.74s]  No, I'm not manifesting this because it's funny.
[1206.15s -> 1206.63s]  Thank the jump.
[1212.53s -> 1213.01s]  I care.
[1223.68s -> 1223.88s]  All right.
[1223.88s -> 1228.64s]  Now this is where it's going to get pretty crazy.
[1231.68s -> 1234.00s]  It looks like the ocean.
[1235.15s -> 1237.95s]  Didn't we talk about this on the hit man stream from like years ago?
[1239.43s -> 1242.59s]  I wish I could be like, if you threw a car battery into the ocean, like what
[1242.59s -> 1244.11s]  happens, you know what I mean?
[1244.11s -> 1247.35s]  Like we've talked about this, how much electricity needs to like
[1247.35s -> 1248.87s]  electrocute the water in the ocean.
[1253.67s -> 1254.59s]  How far does it spread?
[1259.86s -> 1261.46s]  Electric eels are so weird.
[1262.16s -> 1268.97s]  What a wild creature to have organs in their body that hold charges and then
[1269.01s -> 1269.49s]  discharge.
[1274.14s -> 1277.18s]  It's like two or three different organs that do different types of charging, right?
[1277.26s -> 1278.42s]  It's so wild.
[1282.90s -> 1287.54s]  It must be a security measure, a structured path we have to follow.
[1288.34s -> 1290.54s]  Well, let's find the next magic.
[1291.62s -> 1293.14s]  Yeah, I, they kind of are.
[1297.93s -> 1300.41s]  You know how many times I've made a joke about shooting electricity out of my
[1300.41s -> 1300.81s]  hands?
[1301.33s -> 1304.69s]  There is a creature on this earth that does that.
[1306.67s -> 1308.31s]  No, sit here and think about that for one second.
[1308.35s -> 1309.27s]  Just bear with me here.
[1310.03s -> 1315.15s]  There is a creature on earth that shoots electricity out of its body to hurt stuff.
[1316.62s -> 1317.30s]  Excuse me?
[1320.74s -> 1321.58s]  That's not a TV show.
[1321.58s -> 1322.62s]  That's a real life.
[1324.66s -> 1324.90s]  All right.
[1324.90s -> 1325.54s]  I got to pay attention.
[1325.54s -> 1325.98s]  Where am I going?
[1342.13s -> 1343.37s]  Oh, this is like a hub world.
[1343.37s -> 1343.85s]  Okay.
[1344.49s -> 1344.85s]  I get it.
[1353.61s -> 1354.09s]  Are you high?
[1354.09s -> 1354.53s]  Be honest.
[1354.53s -> 1354.73s]  No.
[1355.49s -> 1357.29s]  So you can revisit levels.
[1358.19s -> 1358.83s]  That's cool.
[1358.87s -> 1359.19s]  Okay.
[1360.86s -> 1362.18s]  There's another one that's going to be active.
[1362.18s -> 1362.78s]  I can use them.
[1364.26s -> 1364.74s]  I think.
[1367.94s -> 1368.38s]  How do I turn?
[1368.42s -> 1368.86s]  Oh, here we go.
[1371.99s -> 1373.19s]  You answered way too quickly.
[1375.02s -> 1377.10s]  Now this would be an awful game to do that with.
[1377.26s -> 1377.94s]  Are you kidding me?
[1378.82s -> 1379.86s]  That'd be so bad.
[1381.85s -> 1383.97s]  Do you understand that if that were the case, I would be sitting here like this
[1383.97s -> 1387.62s]  for like 10 straight minutes and people would be like, what, where did he go?
[1387.62s -> 1388.14s]  BRB.
[1389.24s -> 1390.20s]  And then eventually it would just move.
[1390.24s -> 1391.32s]  They go, sorry.
[1391.32s -> 1392.40s]  I was looking at that mountain.
[1399.27s -> 1399.43s]  All right.
[1399.43s -> 1399.91s]  Where's this gone?
[1403.63s -> 1404.27s]  Oh, I need the, yep.
[1404.31s -> 1404.79s]  For the bridge.
[1405.15s -> 1405.35s]  Yep.
[1405.71s -> 1405.95s]  Go.
[1406.95s -> 1407.31s]  Sick.
[1417.53s -> 1417.89s]  Well well,
[1437.40s -> 1439.32s]  the surface you can use to climb up there.
[1445.05s -> 1445.53s]  Chicken wings.
[1447.39s -> 1448.63s]  Definitely high now.
[1460.24s -> 1461.40s]  What do I, what does it want me to do?
[1461.44s -> 1461.96s]  Oh, this.
[1461.96s -> 1462.16s]  Yeah.
[1463.41s -> 1463.93s]  Check this out.
[1465.70s -> 1466.14s]  Cool.
[1466.14s -> 1482.40s]  this game listens to your microphone I don't think it does everything is so
[1482.40s -> 1492.95s]  beautiful it actually is though all right I need two more I remember this
[1492.95s -> 1514.38s]  part this part's cool watch this ready I gotta make a whole painting on future
[1514.38s -> 1525.88s]  skies are bright that is a treasure in the making well that looks like shit I
[1525.88s -> 1532.66s]  made look at connected I connected these clouds and then I put this up here
[1532.66s -> 1560.90s]  where's the Sun oh oops can I have that back it's like why am I in a vacuum
[1560.90s -> 1568.65s]  cleaner it's just there for fun it's not supposed to be you I'm I doesn't matter
[1568.65s -> 1588.79s]  okay I need that how do I get that one give me them both back okay wait do I
[1588.79s -> 1613.83s]  have to do it like this oh shit okay um I think I did it nice give me this

[1624.12s -> 1631.58s]  achievement for dropping a battery off a level I don't think I did that right
[1631.58s -> 1642.60s]  yeah you have to like carve it out that's cool all right what if I do this
[1642.64s -> 1683.67s]  how do I get in here there it is he loves this game it's really cool I don't
[1683.67s -> 1687.70s]  know how many I don't know how many sleepless nights the coder it's just
[1687.70s -> 1697.33s]  like sitting there looking at the code and just going holy shit I feel like
[1697.33s -> 1699.77s]  after a certain point I would just be looking at this and be sitting there
[1699.77s -> 1704.62s]  going okay I'm I'm a genius at some point right like you have to give credit
[1704.62s -> 1710.06s]  where credit is due like you they need to take a lot of credit like this is
[1710.06s -> 1712.94s]  look at this at some point you have to sit there and like look at all you call
[1713.30s -> 1720.88s]  and go holy shit I did a great job and you absolutely deserve to say that I
[1720.88s -> 1746.37s]  destroyed the teleporter what did I do wait what did I do that just oh oh oh
[1746.37s -> 1767.29s]  god oh my god I'm gonna puke what do I do uh what the fuck is going on that was
[1767.29s -> 1773.00s]  really weird way too dank is it too loud seems like the simulation had some
[1773.00s -> 1777.12s]  difficulty maintaining itself we might need to reroute our power sources to
[1777.12s -> 1785.35s]  keep it running that's what we get for messing with old tech genius
[1785.35s -> 1792.19s]  this tricky to get ancient tech back in working order all right
[1802.48s -> 1819.31s]  computer please load Star Trek the next generation engine room please I got
[1819.31s -> 1828.66s]  pretty good oxygen have you guys noticed this is a just as something that I've
[1828.66s -> 1836.58s]  observed I have noticed that since kovat a lot of these are still everywhere
[1836.58s -> 1842.51s]  and I keep trying to put my hand under them and they don't do anything anymore
[1842.51s -> 1849.70s]  they just don't do anything anymore I'll be like oh cool what hand sanitizer let
[1849.70s -> 1854.62s]  me try it there's nothing there oh oh shit there's nothing in this I think
[1854.62s -> 1872.99s]  these have just been not filled for like a year that bad registered and I get
[1872.99s -> 1882.19s]  embarrassed every time I don't I okay I have absolutely been in a field of view
[1882.19s -> 1888.63s]  going from one that didn't do anything to oh there's one over there to the
[1888.63s -> 1892.03s]  other one that doesn't do anything either and then I kind of just put my
[1892.03s -> 1898.71s]  hands together and go like clap clap like okay um I'm gonna keep walking I'm
[1898.71s -> 1910.19s]  just gonna keep walking looks like we're back online ready when you are
[1910.19s -> 1950.70s]  all right let's go it's too bright these panels should be like gray hold on let me
[1950.70s -> 1956.18s]  see okay but the public sanitizers smell like the cheapest vodka and have the
[1956.18s -> 1971.38s]  consistency of saliva that's yeah that's kind of true
[1972.26s -> 1976.69s]  let's get our bearings and find where we left off the foaming yeah the foaming
[1976.69s -> 1982.46s]  ones were awesome if you if you had a foaming hand sanitizer it was just like
[1982.46s -> 1995.30s]  like a little moose oh it was perfect it's all you needed okay so do I go back
[1995.30s -> 2010.21s]  to that other hub that I was just in because that was corrupted right yeah
[2010.21s -> 2023.42s]  there you go you're just like spongebob on spongebob was fucking awesome okay
[2023.42s -> 2029.53s]  spongebob is awesome I'm being compared to who I would determine to be a
[2029.53s -> 2040.90s]  literal God I wouldn't be surprised if you know at the pearly gates it's
[2040.90s -> 2053.12s]  spongebob there okay I might be overdoing this a little bit it's fun
[2053.12s -> 2065.10s]  cool oh I'm here oh I just arrived at the gates oh it's the gates of heaven
[2065.10s -> 2073.33s]  huh spongebob I came over here okay spongebob I think I did a pretty good
[2073.33s -> 2078.79s]  job I did I make it into heaven yeah he pulls a fucking lever and you drop
[2078.79s -> 2094.63s]  straight to hell no you did not make it that's a family guy bit that's fine I'll
[2094.63s -> 2103.47s]  take it repent repent Patrick it's Roger from
[2103.47s -> 2109.73s]  American Dad whatever Roger for American diet they have the same kind of cadences
[2109.73s -> 2117.71s]  Roger from American Dad it's Roger from it's spongebob from American Dad what do
[2117.71s -> 2126.72s]  you want me to say they kind of have the same cases no they don't they kind
[2126.72s -> 2149.34s]  of do they're not even close somebody said I just sounded like somebody from
[2149.34s -> 2170.05s]  from so like from like Hollywood Squares wait what now look at that this is that
[2170.05s -> 2173.54s]  kid this is the cool part this is the part I like the most
[2173.58s -> 2212.44s]  anything any secrets yep this was my favorite now what did I sit on my balls
[2212.44s -> 2223.92s]  or something like what are they what do I do oh shit I remember I remember this
[2223.92s -> 2227.60s]  one I got this is from the demo this is what sealed that I was gonna play this
[2227.60s -> 2236.53s]  game it was at this exact moment that I said yeah when this comes out I'm gonna
[2236.53s -> 2251.18s]  play it he'll say anything in his retirement whatever like that's cool
[2251.18s -> 2273.38s]  Tony said when did we enter the Nintendo DS I was reminded of watching Joel's
[2273.38s -> 2278.42s]  perspective during the house slipper stream that's what I was thinking of
[2278.42s -> 2299.67s]  that was a lot of fun yeah already starting to think about when house
[2299.67s -> 2304.74s]  slipper 2 comes out already the gears are already turning on doing that again
[2304.74s -> 2318.03s]  so should be a lot of fun second time okay this one has a battery right here
[2318.03s -> 2328.41s]  so that's easy get it right over here give them more time yeah we learned a
[2328.41s -> 2334.82s]  lot from that first one so the second one's gonna be I think a little bit
[2334.82s -> 2359.81s]  improved oh I can't like put my face on this I don't know if like this is
[2359.81s -> 2366.37s]  another like funny dumb meme then like you are gonna photocopy you like the
[2366.37s -> 2372.82s]  photo the photocopier joke I think still works even though people that
[2372.82s -> 2376.38s]  doesn't really exist anymore right but like I think that that joke still makes
[2376.38s -> 2383.25s]  sense it still works there's something inherently comical about like oh I'm
[2383.25s -> 2391.09s]  gonna put my face to this is squish my face down to me it's quantity to me it's
[2391.09s -> 2397.45s]  like okay more than five to ten versions of like your smooshed face I don't know
[2397.45s -> 2414.90s]  how dangerous that is all right all right all right everybody relax what do
[2414.90s -> 2441.50s]  I need to photocopy oh definitely this I don't say photocopy too many whoa look
[2441.50s -> 2454.79s]  it's all pixelated oh guys it's just like the sunflowers oh that didn't look
[2454.79s -> 2489.35s]  right okay so what am I actually supposed to do here wait I know that it
[2489.35s -> 2512.43s]  that's it right I have three that's kind of work right yes how did you like
[2512.43s -> 2520.06s]  playing tf2 again it's fun I'm really surprised that that group that MVM group
[2520.06s -> 2529.62s]  did as well as we did we talked for about I want to say at least 15 minutes
[2529.62s -> 2534.02s]  before the stream like okay it's gonna be kind of hard this is difficult it's
[2534.02s -> 2558.67s]  really not easy yeah we destroyed it if Ludwig was going hard all right I need
[2558.67s -> 2572.65s]  some brainpower for this one no whoops should I just say wait is there any more
[2572.65s -> 2589.50s]  pictures over here oh wait a minute I'm gonna use three because I don't know
[2589.50s -> 2615.50s]  what exactly is going on here I make this jump ah I don't need more than
[2615.50s -> 2641.98s]  three probably let me just get them all get the get the duck oh oh this duck I
[2641.98s -> 2665.13s]  need two more ducks and I win is this water doesn't need to have a smell I
[2665.13s -> 2669.37s]  couldn't stop thinking about this while watching a ray attend to her plants
[2669.37s -> 2673.67s]  today there's an addictive quality to this place that makes up for the
[2673.67s -> 2677.79s]  inaccuracies that surround us when we come here out of thin air we create
[2677.79s -> 2682.23s]  beauty that tickles some but not all of our senses I read this as like I'm
[2682.23s -> 2687.90s]  reading sorcery strictly speaking the code we create is a technical marvel in
[2687.90s -> 2690.98s]  designing these structures throughs me like nothing else
[2690.98s -> 2697.14s]  averages every character in sorcery but the novelty of it makes it too easy to
[2697.14s -> 2704.75s]  forget what a real flower smells like and I don't want to forget sorcery

[2857.25s -> 2871.99s]  challenge can you recite the Gears of War lore mmm I can try what was the song
[2871.99s -> 2879.94s]  in the commercial it was like do do do do do do do do do do and they were
[2879.94s -> 2883.34s]  drilling down into the earth and they were all sitting in a pod drilling down
[2883.34s -> 2887.15s]  they were all sitting there and it was just drilling down down down down down
[2887.15s -> 2889.55s]  they had to go to the center of the earth to fight the aliens or something
[2889.55s -> 2911.18s]  that's the only thing I know about the whole game it was mad world was it it
[2911.18s -> 2921.21s]  wasn't the that it wasn't a rock song it was mad world it didn't didn't it did
[2921.21s -> 2926.81s]  it kind of that's that kind of it go listen to what I did and imagine that
[2926.81s -> 2934.74s]  this is something you haven't thought of in ten plus years that was kind of close
[2934.74s -> 2943.28s]  for being a memory that I haven't thought of in a very long time all right
[2943.28s -> 2945.96s]  so this is an optional challenge I don't know what it wants me to do but let's
[2945.96s -> 2964.61s]  find out I'm gonna put it right here here's a war to the last day this is it
[2964.61s -> 2975.84s]  this is not mad world this is it this is the one this is the right one this is
[2975.84s -> 2987.60s]  the right one yep I told you I told you I had it right it wasn't mad world
[2987.60s -> 2993.12s]  that's the one where they're sitting down and they're shaking in the pod and
[2993.12s -> 3000.15s]  it's going down that's gears it that's the Gears of War 2 like trailer oh
[3000.15s -> 3013.76s]  goodness what do they think that was gonna work
[3013.76s -> 3020.42s]  yeah Gears of War 3 is mad world all right well knowing that that means I
[3020.42s -> 3038.15s]  have to go like this I'm smiling the average bro what about this there a
[3038.15s -> 3046.14s]  picture up there yeah there is all right I need to get obviously get up to that
[3046.14s -> 3063.58s]  and I go from here I did there I do this that no not really oh I need to get up
[3063.58s -> 3077.14s]  there what's a maze I know what to do I know it well I already won I was gonna
[3077.14s -> 3123.98s]  say I'll just look at it from above okay now oh shoot oh crap you're cheating
[3123.98s -> 3128.54s]  there's no such thing as cheating in a game like this it's called using
[3128.54s -> 3140.22s]  different parts of your brain to solve different problems all right this needs
[3140.22s -> 3151.07s]  to be much closer I have the right idea this needs to be like over here from the
[3151.07s -> 3175.56s]  table that that should do it right yes it will do these mashed potatoes have
[3175.56s -> 3180.38s]  been going a while I'm getting worried what are you just stirring mashed
[3180.38s -> 3205.66s]  potatoes oh wait doesn't seem right this is not right oh how do I need to
[3205.66s -> 3209.76s]  rotate it okay but if I rewind is that gonna I'm gonna lose all my am I to lose
[3209.76s -> 3236.33s]  progress if I rewind hold on what is on this one did I oh shit okay wait ah I I
[3236.33s -> 3255.05s]  what the hell is happening what's the goal is there like a their goal I don't
[3255.05s -> 3274.89s]  know what the goal is is I don't see a teleporter anywhere up there wait a
[3274.89s -> 3295.36s]  minute I don't get it I missed a photo okay how do I wait hold on I have an
[3295.36s -> 3317.76s]  idea is that the one where's the one that I need to get right there I this is
[3317.76s -> 3337.25s]  a challenge mode this is not our where do the stairs go I just think I might
[3337.25s -> 3348.12s]  have gotten it it's right there can I crouch shit it's right here hold on I'll
[3348.12s -> 3398.80s]  get it this is gonna be puke wait what's that I got it I actually just got it I
[3398.80s -> 3416.16s]  think I can't climb these stairs why what are you talking about what get up
[3416.16s -> 3436.20s]  the stairs what what was wrong with that jump backwards all right this is an
[3436.20s -> 3439.80s]  optional hard mode that's why I'm gonna puke if I stay here for more than like
[3439.80s -> 3463.65s]  10 more minutes why can't I go up these stairs do it again just stop where do I
[3463.65s -> 3475.06s]  need to go do I have to go up there if I have to go up there then I mean I have
[3475.06s -> 3489.95s]  to have to go this way which gives me this picture which then let's go over
[3489.95s -> 3494.22s]  here there's this photo and I need to get each one of these so let me get this
[3494.22s -> 3503.86s]  photo we bring it back here so what if I go like this now I'm just here I just
[3503.86s -> 3508.94s]  wanna see what happens so if I get this this brings me here this gives me
[3508.94s -> 3521.88s]  another one of these which gives me another one of these which gives me this
[3521.88s -> 3537.74s]  which then allows me to I don't know I mean is this bait is this picture is
[3537.74s -> 3545.81s]  bait this has to be what if I go like this and just keep picking up the same
[3545.81s -> 3592.41s]  picture just over and over again I just don't I just don't get it am I am I
[3592.41s -> 3608.36s]  supposed to eventually make it up to the top of here does this do anything for me
[3608.36s -> 3653.83s]  which photo is the teleporter in I didn't I thought okay I thought that I
[3653.83s -> 3658.51s]  was look I didn't have the right context I thought I was trying to get up on top
[3658.51s -> 3663.87s]  of the other buildings that's what I had to do in the last couple times I only
[3663.87s -> 3679.95s]  did one more duck and I can take a bath all right so that went over here
[3679.95s -> 3692.09s]  Oh surprised you made it this far cat pause in a while since someone's
[3692.09s -> 3696.78s]  wandered around this place and it's good to have you there's plenty of things to
[3696.78s -> 3704.03s]  do here have you finished exploring the train will take us to Horia station a
[3704.03s -> 3709.60s]  place where science and art meet am I done with this section I think I did

[4122.26s -> 4140.82s]  strawberries are pretty good something I've been noticing this is a that's
[4140.82s -> 4146.31s]  gonna make me throw up looking at that all right my graphics card when the fan
[4146.31s -> 4163.59s]  turns on now kind of goes like this I think I'm gonna have to replace it oh
[4163.59s -> 4178.78s]  oh but it's not it's not that the fans loud it's making a different noise did
[4178.78s -> 4182.26s]  you okay when it would when the thing when the fan would boot up we all know
[4182.26s -> 4192.22s]  you that's fine the pitch has changed instead of it goes what does a pitch
[4192.26s -> 4206.57s]  change mean bearings might be cooked hmm it's not dirty I usually I usually dust
[4206.57s -> 4223.06s]  it out there's a change when the FPS changes oh it's only when I think that
[4223.06s -> 4243.26s]  it starts to heat up a little it's gonna do a sick drift stare at a wall no it
[4243.26s -> 4246.58s]  doesn't I know I know you were you talking about where if you look at a
[4246.58s -> 4253.56s]  certain thing or if a certain thing it's rendered it's like yeah I know I've
[4253.56s -> 4261.18s]  heard that I know that this is the fan kicking on yeah this is more like a fan
[4261.18s -> 4289.80s]  sound but okay let's see use camera okay I turn this I like does that help me at
[4289.80s -> 4297.14s]  all I'm assuming probably no but I'm gonna just see what happens now I can
[4297.14s -> 4330.00s]  rotate the photo what am I doing uh let me take a look around first why would
[4330.00s -> 4338.61s]  you need two photos if it's just right here excellent show you had coffee yet
[4338.61s -> 4352.17s]  yeah I'm just showing all right two batteries there are four photos I can
[4352.17s -> 4363.60s]  take here just just take them right I'm just gonna let's just see what's the
[4363.60s -> 4371.49s]  cat's name oh I don't know all right battery right there let's go like this
[4371.49s -> 4410.57s]  name the cat I don't know Joey that has a name it's Kate that's right yeah I was
[4410.57s -> 4415.37s]  not paying attention I was half my brain was and then it just buried it
[4415.37s -> 4431.03s]  somewhere all right one more we're probably up there
[4431.03s -> 4449.89s]  but I have a solution to this I hate this mess of my own making. You must know what Mira has been working on, squirreled away in her own little maze, so I can find a way to help her.
[4449.89s -> 4456.40s]  Mending relationships often felt harder for her I have been tending to her plans
[4456.40s -> 4460.56s]  I wonder why she didn't just put in the effort oh I think I just got her hold on
[4460.56s -> 4491.63s]  sorry all right I'm gonna go back here this is on the battery oh shit there it
[4491.63s -> 4516.51s]  is it's right there is that it is that not it I want a good bird's-eye view
[4516.51s -> 4584.94s]  okay where where is it it's not up there okay so is this one right here where is
[4584.94s -> 4591.02s]  the other battery I would imagine to be like around the corner right here but no
[4591.02s -> 4609.25s]  or up top on one of these but it's not where's the other battery huh I have an
[4609.25s -> 4632.98s]  idea oh I know what to do I know what to do there we go
[4632.98s -> 4651.25s]  nope oh I figured it out I got it I got it I got it everybody everybody chill

[4687.13s -> 4693.34s]  since the analog clock I incident I have not been able to do that no I said I'm
[4693.34s -> 4716.05s]  never doing that ever again since the analog clock incident you also admitted
[4716.05s -> 4730.11s]  the analog clock thing was a lie to save face if it that was a lie no no no no
[4730.11s -> 4737.51s]  the cement level in hitman was the lie to save face you're mixing it up but we
[4737.51s -> 4741.18s]  have to make sure we get the record straight the cement level in hitman 3
[4741.18s -> 4758.60s]  was the lie to save face come on you gotta get it right what is this yeah I
[4758.60s -> 4762.56s]  think I distinctly remember looking over at chat at being like oh my god dude no
[4762.56s -> 4766.88s]  no way like what is he all right what's he doing and I was like what am I doing

[5671.66s -> 5683.56s]  You have to take one before and then one after.
[5683.56s -> 5684.72s]  Oh, okay, I bit it.
[5684.72s -> 5689.77s]  But this is the optional challenge now.
[5689.77s -> 5691.69s]  These are gonna get progressively harder and harder,
[5691.69s -> 5692.53s]  and I'm gonna tell you,
[5692.53s -> 5694.65s]  I don't think I'm gonna do all the optional challenges.
[5694.65s -> 5697.07s]  I'm gonna try them for five minutes each.
[5697.07s -> 5710.33s]  Start the timer starting now.
[5710.33s -> 5713.74s]  Complete them, you wimp.
[5713.74s -> 5714.58s]  They're hard.
[5714.58s -> 5720.28s]  All right, so what's going on here?
[5720.28s -> 5721.12s]  I was gonna take a picture of it,
[5721.12s -> 5724.91s]  because I don't know.
[5724.91s -> 5726.93s]  I imagine I could probably use this
[5726.93s -> 5731.19s]  as a platform to jump on.
[5731.19s -> 5732.03s]  What's the goal?
[5732.03s -> 5733.99s]  Let's find the goal.
[5733.99s -> 5739.19s]  The goal is to flip this thing sideways.
[5759.60s -> 5760.90s]  I got it, I've already got it.
[5760.90s -> 5761.94s]  You better start betting,
[5761.94s -> 5763.96s]  because I got it right now.
[5763.96s -> 5765.52s]  You better bet correctly,
[5765.52s -> 5766.80s]  because I just beat it.
[5766.80s -> 5769.04s]  Hopefully, you got 10 seconds to get the bet right,
[5769.04s -> 5791.36s]  because I just did it.
[5791.36s -> 5792.92s]  I know what I gotta do,
[5792.92s -> 5796.02s]  but I don't know how to get up there.
[5796.02s -> 5802.88s]  Wait, hold on.
[5802.88s -> 5803.72s]  Check this out.
[5803.72s -> 5806.39s]  Watch this.
[5806.39s -> 5811.30s]  It's the lowest point.
[5811.30s -> 5812.54s]  I need to see where it is.
[5812.54s -> 5814.56s]  It is, which side is it on?
[5814.56s -> 5816.40s]  All right, it's on this side.
[5816.40s -> 5817.24s]  So it's like,
[5822.24s -> 5824.61s]  I know what I have to do.
[5824.61s -> 5825.61s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5825.61s -> 5826.45s]  I got it, I got it.
[5834.50s -> 5836.88s]  Come on, I got it.
[5836.88s -> 5839.52s]  Is that it?
[5839.52s -> 5852.82s]  Fuck, you know I'm gonna get it right now.
[5852.82s -> 5862.28s]  It's so close.
[5862.28s -> 5863.68s]  Got it.
[5863.68s -> 5865.32s]  Oh, sorry, doubters.
[5865.32s -> 5867.88s]  You just absolutely got destroyed right there.
[5867.88s -> 5870.36s]  I mean, just decimated.
[5870.36s -> 5878.97s]  I kind of feel bad for the doubters, don't you?
[5878.97s -> 5880.81s]  I kind of feel bad for the doubters.
[5880.81s -> 5884.47s]  The first time ever.
[5884.47s -> 5886.07s]  Usually, I'm internally swearing at them,
[5886.07s -> 5890.70s]  but not right now.
[5890.70s -> 5892.30s]  We're heading towards the workspace
[5892.30s -> 5894.87s]  of a masterful engineer.
[5894.87s -> 5896.91s]  See, Leon, much like the others,
[5896.91s -> 5899.52s]  settled in quickly here.
[5899.88s -> 5900.72s]  I got that one.
[5900.72s -> 5901.56s]  I caught that one.
[5901.56s -> 5903.36s]  I caught on pretty quickly on that one.
[5905.36s -> 5906.20s]  Oh, hold on.
[5906.20s -> 5907.04s]  Okay, there we go.
[5907.04s -> 5918.02s]  It's okay, the points don't matter since he's retired.
[5918.02s -> 5921.00s]  I'm sure you'll find something useful here.
[5921.00s -> 5923.42s]  I always believed in you.
[5923.42s -> 5924.74s]  Well, thanks, Joe.
[5924.74s -> 5925.58s]  Really important, Jerma.
[5925.58s -> 5938.40s]  What is your sleep positioning?
[5938.40s -> 5942.48s]  I am a side sleeper, usually.
[5942.48s -> 5943.32s]  Usually.
[5943.32s -> 5952.88s]  I got the, usually I'm on my right side,
[5953.24s -> 5958.24s]  and I've got a good pillow to support my arm and shoulder,
[5958.76s -> 5959.84s]  like my arm and forearm,
[5959.84s -> 5964.36s]  and I'm like right at the bicep meeting the forearm area,
[5964.36s -> 5965.40s]  is under the pillow,
[5965.40s -> 5968.00s]  and I'm kind of propped up right side, lying that way.
[5968.00s -> 5971.00s]  My legs are sort of down on the, you know what I mean?
[5971.00s -> 5973.24s]  I feel like most people sleep like that.
[5973.24s -> 5978.16s]  That's probably a majority.
[5978.16s -> 5979.00s]  Filter select.
[5980.88s -> 5988.35s]  Do you sleep hanging from the ceiling like a bat?
[5988.95s -> 5994.80s]  Do you sleep hanging from the ceiling like a bat?
[5994.80s -> 6007.16s]  That would be really weird.
[6007.16s -> 6008.99s]  What does this say?
[6008.99s -> 6015.36s]  Information?
[6015.36s -> 6020.36s]  Dude, you guys have no idea.
[6022.19s -> 6024.83s]  It's gonna be, I, okay.
[6024.83s -> 6028.60s]  I'm going to commit to one bit this year,
[6028.60s -> 6031.40s]  and it's gonna be a good one.
[6031.40s -> 6036.19s]  I promise.
[6036.19s -> 6037.47s]  It's not a big bit.
[6037.47s -> 6044.30s]  It's just a small bit, but I'm gonna commit to it.
[6044.30s -> 6047.22s]  Pauly and I were laughing a lot about this,
[6047.22s -> 6052.48s]  and it's, it just, it has to be done.
[6052.48s -> 6054.43s]  It must be done.
[6054.43s -> 6059.71s]  Where's the level?
[6059.71s -> 6066.67s]  They're all staticky.
[6066.67s -> 6072.32s]  Don't say, I won't say, I won't say.
[6072.32s -> 6073.20s]  Will it be on YouTube or?
[6073.20s -> 6076.11s]  No, it'll be stream.
[6076.11s -> 6079.36s]  Probably just easier that way.
[6079.36s -> 6088.17s]  How do I unlock these?
[6088.17s -> 6095.57s]  Uh, excuse me?
[6095.57s -> 6102.27s]  Is there higher up that I didn't see?
[6102.27s -> 6103.63s]  It's gonna be really hard not to laugh,
[6103.63s -> 6106.51s]  but I will go into actor mode,
[6106.51s -> 6116.76s]  and I promise you, I will see the bit through.
[6116.76s -> 6122.65s]  By the train.
[6122.65s -> 6129.04s]  Right in front of the train?
[6129.04s -> 6136.23s]  Yeah, okay.
[6136.23s -> 6139.58s]  Ooh, I love the teal.
[6139.58s -> 6143.78s]  It's my favorite color.
[6143.78s -> 6146.28s]  Did you guess?
[6146.28s -> 6157.18s]  My entire channel is based around like these three colors.
[6157.18s -> 6160.72s]  Do you hear that?
[6160.72s -> 6165.19s]  Freeze.
[6165.19s -> 6166.31s]  Oh, another one of these.
[6166.31s -> 6167.15s]  Oh, all the levers.
[6167.15s -> 6167.99s]  What are we looking for?
[6167.99s -> 6173.56s]  All right, mountain.
[6173.56s -> 6179.71s]  Okay, need to watch this.
[6179.71s -> 6181.51s]  I was hoping I could just do a weird hop around it.
[6181.51s -> 6190.23s]  I probably can.
[6190.27s -> 6191.39s]  That's pretty close.
[6191.39s -> 6199.72s]  It's definitely doable.
[6199.72s -> 6200.92s]  Someone else will do it.
[6200.92s -> 6207.77s]  I know you will.
[6207.77s -> 6211.69s]  Don't hold W while you air strafe.
[6211.69s -> 6213.61s]  I feel like that was screamed at me
[6213.61s -> 6215.93s]  so many times over the years,
[6215.93s -> 6218.89s]  and I just never was able to not do it.
[6218.89s -> 6231.57s]  Just always press W.
[6231.57s -> 6232.49s]  You're just so conditioned
[6232.49s -> 6249.20s]  to be holding the move forward button.
[6249.20s -> 6258.59s]  I don't see a picture anywhere.
[6258.59s -> 6259.79s]  Jerma, I'm a dumb animal.
[6259.79s -> 6280.69s]  If I can let go of W, you can too.
[6280.69s -> 6283.69s]  I'm not even sure that's a possible physics ability
[6283.69s -> 6285.60s]  you can even do in this game.
[6286.44s -> 6291.59s]  I did let go of W though, I promise.
[6291.59s -> 6293.84s]  Okay, well, there's the teleporter.
[6293.84s -> 6311.86s]  Hey, look at that.
[6311.86s -> 6314.16s]  Air strafe is a Source thing.
[6314.16s -> 6319.52s]  Yeah.
[6319.52s -> 6320.88s]  All right, so very clearly,
[6320.88s -> 6324.31s]  I, oh, I thought I had to get four.
[6324.31s -> 6325.27s]  One, two, three.
[6325.27s -> 6333.34s]  Ah.
[6333.34s -> 6334.34s]  Well done.
[6334.34s -> 6335.18s]  Thanks.
[6335.18s -> 6342.47s]  It's a shame things crumbled.
[6342.47s -> 6344.89s]  Cake.
[6344.89s -> 6353.75s]  I don't like cake.
[6353.75s -> 6358.40s]  Can we get a poll?
[6358.40s -> 6360.44s]  I actually, and please answer honestly.
[6360.44s -> 6361.72s]  I know sometimes people mess around here,
[6361.72s -> 6366.17s]  but standard cake.
[6366.17s -> 6368.58s]  A standard birthday cake.
[6368.58s -> 6370.14s]  No, not ice cream cake.
[6370.14s -> 6371.70s]  Not a tiramisu.
[6371.70s -> 6374.76s]  Just a cake.
[6374.76s -> 6377.48s]  Just a regular cake.
[6377.48s -> 6382.48s]  Do you rate that higher than a C plus?
[6382.56s -> 6386.04s]  Is standard cake higher than a C plus?
[6386.04s -> 6387.45s]  Yes or no?
[6387.45s -> 6399.52s]  Because I am somebody that says no.
[6399.52s -> 6409.30s]  I'm very curious where everybody stands on this, honestly.
[6409.30s -> 6410.74s]  It's a very standard C.
[6410.74s -> 6413.36s]  That's what I mean.
[6413.36s -> 6417.83s]  I do wonder how many people see cake as higher than C plus.
[6418.07s -> 6420.23s]  I feel like it's probably a lot of people.
[6430.43s -> 6432.64s]  I thought that was a burger.
[6446.94s -> 6447.98s]  Okay.
[6447.98s -> 6451.36s]  So I'm gonna guess that I have to take a picture
[6451.36s -> 6452.84s]  of this with the poster.
[6457.29s -> 6458.13s]  Oh.
[6466.53s -> 6469.29s]  I can't wait to see how you use this.
[6469.29s -> 6470.13s]  I use it myself.
[6470.13s -> 6471.05s]  Wow.
[6471.05s -> 6473.49s]  58% higher than a C plus.
[6473.49s -> 6477.58s]  Wow.
[6477.58s -> 6481.86s]  That's actually really surprising.
[6481.86s -> 6495.26s]  Okay.
[6495.26s -> 6497.10s]  I would say it's a C plus.
[6497.10s -> 6499.24s]  Maybe a C.
[6499.24s -> 6504.55s]  Some, but some cake is terrible.
[6504.55s -> 6505.63s]  I have never, okay.
[6505.63s -> 6510.16s]  Ice cream is always gonna be an A.
[6510.16s -> 6513.08s]  Because even like bad ice cream, it's ice cream.
[6513.08s -> 6514.64s]  It's just, it doesn't matter what ice cream it is.
[6514.64s -> 6515.48s]  It's gonna be fine.
[6515.80s -> 6516.64s]  Okay.
[6516.64s -> 6518.36s]  What are my options at the dessert?
[6518.36s -> 6520.40s]  It's cake is, okay.
[6520.40s -> 6522.56s]  There's vanilla ice cream on the table over there.
[6522.56s -> 6523.84s]  There's cookies.
[6523.84s -> 6525.48s]  That ice cream is always gonna be perfect.
[6525.48s -> 6527.48s]  I'm always gonna be okay with that.
[6527.48s -> 6529.96s]  But I've had a lot of cakes before that were bad.
[6529.96s -> 6533.88s]  That were way less than a C.
[6533.88s -> 6539.87s]  Grayscale, cold, warm.
[6539.87s -> 6540.71s]  Whoa.
[6540.71s -> 6541.63s]  This is really weird.
[6541.63s -> 6547.20s]  I'm gonna do this for one second.
[6547.20s -> 6557.61s]  Game boy.
[6557.61s -> 6561.45s]  Did I even activate it?
[6561.45s -> 6563.17s]  What are these bad cakes?
[6563.17s -> 6566.58s]  Dry as heck.
[6566.58s -> 6568.54s]  I have eaten cakes before that were super moist.
[6568.54s -> 6569.94s]  And okay, this is higher than a C plus.
[6569.94s -> 6570.86s]  This is all right.
[6570.86s -> 6572.42s]  This might be close.
[6572.42s -> 6574.30s]  But I've had cake before that.
[6574.30s -> 6575.86s]  I feel like I'm eating sawdust.
[6586.56s -> 6588.32s]  Oh, all right.
[6588.32s -> 6594.12s]  I kind of don't want to do this anymore.
[6594.12s -> 6594.96s]  Do you know what I mean?
[6594.96s -> 6597.00s]  I don't know if I like this filter.
[6597.00s -> 6602.84s]  Now I understand what it was for.
[6602.84s -> 6609.40s]  I can't even read the instructions.
[6609.40s -> 6625.80s]  Yeah, we are going to change this.
[6625.80s -> 6627.24s]  What is better on average?
[6627.24s -> 6628.64s]  What were the other options?
[6628.64s -> 6630.67s]  Cake over pie?
[6630.67s -> 6631.51s]  Huh?
[6633.50s -> 6634.90s]  Cake over pie?
[6636.54s -> 6637.90s]  What are you talking about?
[6637.90s -> 6644.15s]  No, no way.
[6644.15s -> 6649.15s]  Over like a banana cream pie or a chocolate cream pie.
[6650.20s -> 6652.70s]  I thought that apple pie,
[6652.70s -> 6659.40s]  I thought you guys were apple pie Andes.
[6659.40s -> 6682.07s]  All right, I can't even look at that.
[6682.07s -> 6682.91s]  Apple pie.
[6682.91s -> 6685.11s]  I don't even like apple pie.
[6685.11s -> 6688.06s]  Oh, a lot of people just heard that
[6688.06s -> 6694.62s]  for the first time, I think.
[6694.62s -> 6696.10s]  A lot of people may have just heard that
[6696.10s -> 6699.40s]  for the first time.
[6700.16s -> 6706.43s]  I want them to be closer.
[6706.43s -> 6708.39s]  Okay, well, did I just do it?
[6708.39s -> 6709.51s]  I just beat it.
[6709.51s -> 6714.86s]  Oh, okay, let me explain.
[6714.86s -> 6717.22s]  Let me explain.
[6717.22s -> 6720.26s]  Everybody that's saying, what the fuck?
[6720.26s -> 6724.66s]  If apple pie just had the sludge in it
[6724.66s -> 6729.02s]  and not the apple pieces, the apple slices,
[6729.02s -> 6731.02s]  if it was just the pie crust,
[6731.02s -> 6734.86s]  the sludge filling and no apple slices,
[6734.86s -> 6738.38s]  I would love it.
[6738.38s -> 6739.78s]  You take the apple slices out
[6739.78s -> 6745.80s]  and that would be one of my favorite pies.
[6745.80s -> 6747.56s]  That's fucked up.
[6747.56s -> 6748.40s]  That's fine.
[6748.40s -> 6752.20s]  But that sweet apple flavor is great.
[6752.20s -> 6755.68s]  I just don't like the warm, hot, slimy, slippery,
[6755.68s -> 6758.48s]  like apple, no, no, no, no, no.
[6758.48s -> 6759.88s]  It's just, I don't like it.
[6775.42s -> 6787.36s]  I'm getting achievements for doing this.
[6787.36s -> 6795.71s]  No bully.
[6795.71s -> 6798.11s]  NA has the worst cuisine.
[6800.12s -> 6800.96s]  What does that have?
[6800.96s -> 6802.08s]  That has nothing to do with,
[6802.12s -> 6803.92s]  I'm sorry, but banana cream, where is banana?
[6803.92s -> 6807.74s]  Where did banana cream pie originate from?
[6807.74s -> 6810.58s]  Because American desserts, hold on.
[6810.58s -> 6812.74s]  Hold the phone for a second.
[6812.74s -> 6821.69s]  American desserts are ridiculous.
[6821.77s -> 6822.61s]  Where did banana cream,
[6822.61s -> 6824.49s]  who made the first banana cream pie?
[6824.49s -> 6825.61s]  Coconut cream pie?
[6825.61s -> 6828.78s]  Are you serious?
[6828.78s -> 6829.78s]  What about donuts?
[6829.78s -> 6832.90s]  Who made the first donut?
[6832.90s -> 6835.18s]  Eh, it's probably like German or something.
[6835.18s -> 6836.62s]  Banana cream pie though, where did it come from?
[6836.62s -> 6837.46s]  Look it up.
[6837.46s -> 6841.66s]  Pecan pie, look it up.
[6841.82s -> 6844.46s]  Excuse me, cotton candy ice cream, look it up.
[6846.97s -> 6849.96s]  I'm just kidding.
[6849.96s -> 6851.20s]  American desserts suck.
[6851.20s -> 6852.32s]  No, they don't.
[6852.32s -> 6854.04s]  It's like one of the things that Americans make
[6854.04s -> 6868.40s]  that are very good.
[6868.40s -> 6877.48s]  Americans make fantastic desserts.
[6877.48s -> 6878.56s]  Barbecue?
[6878.56s -> 6880.08s]  Yeah, excuse me.
[6880.08s -> 6881.28s]  I don't want to hear that.
[6881.28s -> 6884.52s]  Look, I know like Americans, hey, LLM.
[6884.52s -> 6887.78s]  I got a nice smoked brisket.
[6887.78s -> 6891.03s]  Come on, Gwen.
[6891.03s -> 6900.26s]  I do not want to hear that.
[6900.26s -> 6901.46s]  Do Oreos count?
[6909.01s -> 6911.93s]  I want to say yes, but I can't
[6911.93s -> 6915.61s]  because weren't they something else like a long time?
[6915.61s -> 6918.05s]  Wasn't there like a whole thing about Oreos
[6918.05s -> 6918.89s]  and what are they called?
[6918.89s -> 6922.29s]  Hydrox, is there something?
[6925.76s -> 6927.20s]  Was Hydrox American?
[6927.20s -> 6930.58s]  I think it was.
[6930.58s -> 6933.10s]  But do other countries have cereals with mascots?
[6933.10s -> 6933.94s]  Checkmate.
[6933.94s -> 6938.63s]  That's right.
[6938.63s -> 6939.79s]  Yeah, sorry.
[6939.79s -> 6942.13s]  Tony the Tiger.
[6942.13s -> 6948.36s]  Tony the Tiger, it's American, okay?
[6948.36s -> 6949.24s]  Yeah, they do.
[6949.24s -> 6950.08s]  Yeah, they do.
[6950.08s -> 6951.40s]  Oh, all right.
[6951.40s -> 6952.48s]  You want to have a cage match
[6952.48s -> 6954.68s]  between Tony the Tiger, Count Chocula
[6954.68s -> 6958.64s]  and that fucking wacky Cocoa Puffs bird
[6958.64s -> 6961.20s]  against whatever the fuck you're going to bring to the table?
[6961.20s -> 6970.96s]  What's going to get in there in the cage match?
[6970.96s -> 6972.36s]  Wait, were they fighting?
[6972.36s -> 6973.40s]  I forget.
[6973.40s -> 6981.44s]  I think they were fighting, weren't they?
[6981.44s -> 6982.28s]  I don't know.
[6982.28s -> 6984.28s]  I've never really thought that much about cereal mascots.
[6984.28s -> 6986.16s]  He's patriotic for cereal.
[6994.00s -> 7008.64s]  Of course I am because they are great.
[7008.64s -> 7012.01s]  I'm available.
[7012.01s -> 7019.20s]  All right, what am I doing?
[7019.20s -> 7022.92s]  Yeah, Captain Crunch.
[7022.92s -> 7026.36s]  You go, yeah, my cereal mascot from, I don't know,
[7026.36s -> 7028.74s]  wherever, from England,
[7028.74s -> 7032.22s]  my cereal mascot will beat your cereal mascot's ass.
[7032.22s -> 7034.48s]  Oh yeah?
[7034.48s -> 7037.68s]  Captain Crunch will launch a fucking Crunchberry Cannonball
[7037.68s -> 7041.79s]  out of his ship at you, all right?
[7041.79s -> 7043.87s]  You want to sail the seas against Captain Crunch?
[7043.87s -> 7046.19s]  Bring it.
[7046.19s -> 7047.11s]  Why do I care about this?
[7047.11s -> 7058.25s]  All right, I need to play the game.
[7058.25s -> 7060.01s]  Play the game, nobody cares.
[7060.01s -> 7062.17s]  Oh, I think a lot of people care,
[7062.77s -> 7068.16s]  judging by the amount of scathing reviews I'm getting.
[7068.16s -> 7076.50s]  All right, so I got to get that.
[7076.50s -> 7087.81s]  Let's get a picture of that first.
[7087.81s -> 7092.75s]  Well, that was way easier than I was making it.
[7092.75s -> 7093.79s]  You still eat Oreos?
[7095.53s -> 7101.24s]  I'd say maybe sometimes.
[7101.24s -> 7105.07s]  Whoa, what's this?
[7105.07s -> 7107.68s]  That's kind of cool.
[7107.68s -> 7113.58s]  What about the Honey Nut Cheerios Bee?
[7113.58s -> 7118.56s]  What's your number one snack right now?
[7118.56s -> 7119.40s]  I don't know if I could say,
[7119.40s -> 7121.44s]  it really does vary depending on the mood.
[7121.80s -> 7126.96s]  Celia always fond of games.
[7126.96s -> 7127.80s]  Can I play this?
[7140.84s -> 7142.78s]  Honestly, if you want the real answer,
[7142.78s -> 7145.46s]  it's probably hummus.
[7145.46s -> 7147.66s]  I could eat hummus all day, every single day.
[7147.66s -> 7151.12s]  And I probably have always one of the first things
[7151.12s -> 7151.96s]  that I get at the grocery store.
[7151.96s -> 7153.28s]  Did you nick my biscuit?
[7153.28s -> 7156.24s]  Love it so much, it's like the best thing in the world.
[7156.24s -> 7158.82s]  What sort of accusation is that?
[7158.82s -> 7161.42s]  Did, didn't you?
[7161.42s -> 7162.82s]  I can always ask Kate, you know.
[7162.82s -> 7165.14s]  Oh, right, so what if I did?
[7165.14s -> 7166.82s]  I was just sitting there going uneaten.
[7166.82s -> 7169.14s]  It's not as if it could have gone cold.
[7169.18s -> 7170.78s]  Hummus with a little bit of bread.
[7171.78s -> 7174.34s]  Kate, can you please run shortbread for PXE
[7174.34s -> 7175.82s]  for our esteemed colleague.
[7175.82s -> 7176.66s]  Non-bread.
[7178.46s -> 7179.62s]  Chickpeas are so good.
[7181.08s -> 7183.96s]  What am I supposed to, am I supposed to go in?
[7183.96s -> 7186.04s]  Wait, I'm not actually supposed to walk.
[7186.04s -> 7186.88s]  I am.
[7186.88s -> 7188.52s]  Okay, hold on.
[7188.52s -> 7194.74s]  Wait a minute.
[7194.74s -> 7197.02s]  Wait, this is really cool, hold on.
[7197.02s -> 7207.93s]  I gotta jump down on it.
[7207.93s -> 7215.32s]  That makes sense, doesn't it?
[7215.32s -> 7221.85s]  Oh, that makes so much sense.
[7221.85s -> 7230.59s]  Come on, get in there.
[7230.71s -> 7248.03s]  Yes, it's something like that, right?
[7248.03s -> 7251.13s]  Oh, wait, what's this?
[7251.13s -> 7255.60s]  Am I overthinking this like crazy or what?
[7255.60s -> 7258.88s]  I'm overthinking this one?
[7258.88s -> 7262.58s]  Okay.
[7270.16s -> 7271.18s]  Hang on.
[7271.18s -> 7272.02s]  Oh.
[7272.02s -> 7272.86s]  Did that sink?
[7272.86s -> 7273.70s]  You make my biscuit.
[7273.70s -> 7274.54s]  Me?
[7274.54s -> 7275.38s]  What goes on?
[7275.38s -> 7276.22s]  I steal your biscuit.
[7276.22s -> 7277.06s]  Must they flip?
[7277.06s -> 7278.38s]  What sort of accusation is that?
[7278.38s -> 7281.62s]  You did, didn't you?
[7281.62s -> 7282.98s]  I can always ask Kate, you know.
[7282.98s -> 7283.82s]  I don't get it.
[7283.82s -> 7285.30s]  Oh, right, so what if I did?
[7285.30s -> 7287.02s]  I was just sitting there going uneaten.
[7287.02s -> 7289.10s]  It's not as if it could have gone cold.
[7289.10s -> 7290.90s]  Well, if you're gonna kick up a fuss.
[7290.90s -> 7291.74s]  Oh, I get it.
[7291.74s -> 7292.58s]  I fall into it.
[7292.58s -> 7294.54s]  Maybe please run short my Doki XC
[7294.54s -> 7296.10s]  for our esteemed colleague here.
[7296.10s -> 7297.98s]  I get it.
[7297.98s -> 7305.96s]  Biscuit thief.
[7305.96s -> 7313.35s]  I don't get it.
[7313.35s -> 7339.48s]  What am I trying to do here?
[7339.48s -> 7342.84s]  What was the, why was this cool thing here?
[7342.84s -> 7346.88s]  What?
[7346.88s -> 7351.37s]  Is this just a cool thing?
[7351.37s -> 7362.60s]  Well, okay.
[7362.60s -> 7369.91s]  All right, where's the batteries?
[7369.91s -> 7371.60s]  I did this one in the demo,
[7371.60s -> 7384.93s]  so I should get it pretty quickly.
[7384.93s -> 7385.77s]  It's two, right?
[7385.77s -> 7386.61s]  Yep.
[7386.61s -> 7389.83s]  Okay, and then I need to take a picture of this,
[7389.83s -> 7392.85s]  put it this way,
[7392.85s -> 7396.53s]  because then, aha.
[7396.53s -> 7397.85s]  I pre-played this level.
[7397.85s -> 7413.67s]  I did it in the demo.
[7413.67s -> 7414.51s]  What about on this table?
[7414.51s -> 7417.73s]  Something to pick up?
[7417.73s -> 7419.49s]  Everything keeps breaking.
[7419.49s -> 7420.53s]  You think in a simulation,
[7420.53s -> 7422.13s]  everything will find a way to maintain itself,
[7422.13s -> 7423.81s]  but no.
[7423.81s -> 7424.65s]  Change the filter?
[7424.65s -> 7426.13s]  Yeah, I have to wait till the next level.
[7426.13s -> 7427.17s]  Keeps me busy.
[7427.17s -> 7428.79s]  Some piece.
[7428.79s -> 7430.43s]  I could have done it, like dropped out,
[7430.43s -> 7431.95s]  but I would have probably had to do all these levels.
[7431.95s -> 7435.91s]  What is that?
[7435.91s -> 7437.62s]  This is Tetris.
[7437.62s -> 7441.21s]  Does it actually play?
[7441.21s -> 7444.01s]  Ooh, yeah, it definitely does.
[7444.01s -> 7444.85s]  All right, so hold on.
[7444.85s -> 7469.95s]  How do I do this?
[7470.55s -> 7472.15s]  Dude, all right, I can get this.
[7472.15s -> 7481.79s]  Wait a second.
[7481.79s -> 7487.92s]  Can I?
[7487.92s -> 7506.48s]  Maybe not.
[7506.48s -> 7507.96s]  Shit, all of it was gone.
[7507.96s -> 7509.36s]  Whatever.
[7509.36s -> 7511.56s]  This is cool, but somebody else can figure this out.
[7511.56s -> 7512.44s]  It's a fun little thing.
[7512.44s -> 7526.51s]  What's this one?
[7526.51s -> 7527.35s]  I'm right here.
[7527.35s -> 7538.73s]  Give it to me.
[7538.73s -> 7553.89s]  Holy shit.
[7553.89s -> 7568.27s]  Can I go all the way up?
[7568.27s -> 7569.70s]  All right, I did it.
[7569.70s -> 7576.48s]  That's fun.
[7576.48s -> 7580.96s]  Those will stack infinitely.
[7580.96s -> 7595.93s]  They will?
[7595.93s -> 7596.77s]  Oh, shit.
[7597.89s -> 7599.09s]  I found something else fun to do.
[7599.09s -> 7605.80s]  Hold on.
[7605.80s -> 7610.59s]  I don't care about the level right now.
[7610.59s -> 7617.16s]  Like, I just want to do five of those.
[7617.16s -> 7618.12s]  Where was that thing?
[7618.12s -> 7619.12s]  Yeah, I'm gonna get a picture
[7619.12s -> 7623.40s]  of like three or four at the same time.
[7623.40s -> 7631.60s]  So technically if I go like this
[7631.60s -> 7632.64s]  and then like that,
[7677.37s -> 7700.83s]  it's gotta get one and I'm good.
[7700.83s -> 7708.08s]  Oh, shit.
[7708.08s -> 7719.40s]  All right, I gotta take my time.
[7730.32s -> 7733.08s]  I don't even care about the teleporter.
[7733.08s -> 7734.70s]  And I'll go back because I can,
[7734.70s -> 7736.02s]  let's go like this.
[7736.02s -> 7742.35s]  That's better.
[7742.35s -> 7756.36s]  Goodness.
[7756.36s -> 7757.76s]  This guy sucks.
[7757.76s -> 7768.24s]  No, it's kind of hard to get these.
[7768.24s -> 7783.99s]  Oh my God.
[7783.99s -> 7794.03s]  Uh-oh.
[7794.03s -> 7794.87s]  No!
[7798.76s -> 7820.97s]  Go, ah, wait.
[7820.97s -> 7829.92s]  Oh, fuck off.
[7865.66s -> 7877.11s]  Shit.
[7877.11s -> 7877.95s]  I want to restart
[7877.95s -> 7881.47s]  because I have a better idea.
[7881.47s -> 7885.85s]  I'm gonna put them closer together.
[7885.85s -> 7886.77s]  I want to get them all.
[7886.77s -> 7887.69s]  This is gonna be so stupid,
[7887.69s -> 7888.53s]  but I don't care.
[7888.53s -> 7890.25s]  It's fun.
[7890.25s -> 7892.90s]  All right, so here's the plan.
[7892.90s -> 7894.42s]  Plan is put this in a spot
[7894.42s -> 7896.22s]  where I can get to it easily,
[7896.22s -> 7897.78s]  like down.
[7897.78s -> 7902.72s]  Okay, here we go.
[7902.72s -> 7955.33s]  Now, I'm not stuck.
[7955.33s -> 7969.70s]  I'm doing something weird.
[7969.70s -> 7994.83s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[7994.83s -> 7995.79s]  God damn it.
[8018.59s -> 8019.67s]  Oh, yep.
[8019.67s -> 8043.72s]  Here it is.
[8045.60s -> 8046.96s]  Absolutely perfect.
[8047.76s -> 8048.60s]  Now, I can fall down and get these stones.
[8048.60s -> 8051.54s]  Do it like an idiot.
[8051.54s -> 8059.55s]  I lucked out so bad right there.
[8059.55s -> 8061.04s]  Okay, it's time.
[8061.04s -> 8081.26s]  I got them all.
[8081.26s -> 8082.10s]  Stop doing that.
[8082.10s -> 8082.98s]  I have to go straight up.
[8082.98s -> 8090.74s]  I need to break the fucking video game.
[8090.74s -> 8092.99s]  This is it right here.
[8092.99s -> 8124.92s]  Here we go.
[8124.92s -> 8128.68s]  Shit, hold on.
[8128.68s -> 8134.91s]  I have to air strafe way sooner.
[8134.91s -> 8149.75s]  Let's go.
[8149.75s -> 8150.83s]  Luigi, Luigi!
[8164.63s -> 8172.00s]  That was kind of fun.
[8172.00s -> 8174.01s]  You just scared my cat
[8174.01s -> 8185.24s]  and my dad.
[8185.24s -> 8187.28s]  Well, keep me on lower volume.
[8187.28s -> 8192.36s]  This is a comedy stream.
[8192.36s -> 8193.84s]  You woke up my husband.
[8193.84s -> 8195.12s]  Well, I,
[8195.16s -> 8196.00s]  why are you listening to me?
[8196.00s -> 8196.84s]  Full blast.
[8196.84s -> 8209.82s]  What are you doing?
[8209.82s -> 8211.38s]  That was fun.
[8211.38s -> 8226.52s]  That was worth wasting 15 minutes, 20 minutes on.
[8226.52s -> 8230.68s]  Is it only two or is it three?
[8230.68s -> 8254.23s]  Oh, it's only two.
[8254.23s -> 8256.95s]  Did you know that scientists have to spend years
[8256.95s -> 8257.79s]  developing new technologies?
[8257.79s -> 8262.20s]  All right, let me turn this off.
[8262.20s -> 8264.80s]  Negative is kind of cool.
[8266.46s -> 8272.45s]  How do I just turn it off?
[8272.45s -> 8280.30s]  Do I have to pick one?
[8280.30s -> 8284.26s]  Is warm the default?
[8284.26s -> 8286.06s]  Grayscale is the default.
[8286.06s -> 8287.65s]  I'll try warm.
[8287.65s -> 8292.43s]  Actually, I kind of like the color.
[8292.43s -> 8293.55s]  I like the color.
[8293.55s -> 8304.63s]  Wait, there's an optional level here, isn't there?
[8304.63s -> 8306.91s]  Beauty of the simulation.
[8307.03s -> 8311.60s]  What you can achieve in a year's time can be.
[8311.60s -> 8328.56s]  I have one shot.
[8328.56s -> 8329.40s]  That's not bad.
[8329.40s -> 8330.68s]  I actually prefer the warm.
[8330.68s -> 8333.52s]  I mean, they had the cold tones,
[8333.52s -> 8339.84s]  but that's still fine.
[8339.84s -> 8341.28s]  Stop right there and shout your guess.
[8341.28s -> 8343.32s]  Three.
[8343.32s -> 8345.08s]  The answer is three.
[8352.34s -> 8353.82s]  These might be useful.
[8366.88s -> 8368.64s]  I want my, I want my camera back.
[8376.84s -> 8378.40s]  What should I, happy birthday?
[8388.52s -> 8390.84s]  Happy birthday, whoever's birthday it is.
[8393.83s -> 8395.35s]  No photos allowed.
[8404.84s -> 8406.80s]  I only have one shot here.
[8412.48s -> 8453.40s]  That was really not what I thought I was gonna, whatever.
[8453.40s -> 8481.75s]  It kind of worked.
[8481.75s -> 8520.47s]  You idiot.
[8520.47s -> 8522.93s]  Now this is content.
[8522.93s -> 8524.25s]  This game is pretty fun.
[8524.25s -> 8537.08s]  I like it.
[8537.08s -> 8540.14s]  Okay, one shot in the camera.
[8540.14s -> 8542.69s]  Now what?
[8545.96s -> 8547.16s]  This one's complicated.
[8547.28s -> 8548.75s]  Quite.
[8549.59s -> 8551.83s]  I feel like it's gonna be pretty simple.
[8551.83s -> 8552.67s]  Watch this.
[8558.59s -> 8562.50s]  Where is the teleporter?
[8562.50s -> 8564.61s]  Over there.
[8564.61s -> 8565.77s]  I need two.
[8575.33s -> 8579.69s]  Okay.
[8579.69s -> 8600.28s]  Where's the other battery?
[8606.18s -> 8614.40s]  Is there more film up there?
[8614.40s -> 8615.24s]  It's all right.
[8615.24s -> 8620.94s]  I just want to see what's,
[8620.94s -> 8623.80s]  I only have one thing of film though.
[8623.80s -> 8630.36s]  I need like a wide shot of this.
[8630.36s -> 8631.20s]  Oh.
[8655.10s -> 8655.94s]  Shit.
[8656.18s -> 8662.70s]  Oh, stop.
[8662.70s -> 8665.78s]  There's one angle I can probably get them both in a picture.
[8665.78s -> 8668.09s]  Through the wall?
[8668.09s -> 8670.71s]  Hold on.
[8670.71s -> 8671.99s]  I go like this.
[8671.99s -> 8675.48s]  Will this count?
[8675.48s -> 8678.96s]  And then say if I do that, does that work?
[8687.43s -> 8691.48s]  Kind of.
[8691.48s -> 8692.32s]  I need to.
[8706.58s -> 8708.30s]  Yeah, I know.
[8708.30s -> 8710.38s]  But like, ah, it takes a second.
[8710.38s -> 8712.58s]  The easy ones sometimes are,
[8712.58s -> 8713.86s]  they, you know what I mean.
[8713.86s -> 8721.20s]  Sometimes it's not that simple.
[8721.20s -> 8732.94s]  Takes an extra two seconds.
[8732.94s -> 8739.09s]  Hey.
[8739.17s -> 8750.40s]  Now this is the mahjong table.
[8750.40s -> 8753.42s]  All right, this turns this on.
[8753.42s -> 8754.56s]  Cool.
[8754.56s -> 8762.56s]  But interesting.
[8762.56s -> 8768.37s]  You're all so creative.
[8768.37s -> 8774.82s]  What do you call a melon that commits a crime?
[8774.82s -> 8777.02s]  A water felon.
[8777.02s -> 8792.38s]  I didn't even need, I didn't even need to look it up.
[8792.38s -> 8795.09s]  See?
[8795.09s -> 8796.09s]  This is weirdly placed.
[8796.09s -> 8797.09s]  Why is it like this?
[8815.87s -> 8822.66s]  Probably a duck down here.
[8822.66s -> 8834.64s]  Well, okay.
[8834.64s -> 8836.04s]  You're tracking dirt in.
[8836.04s -> 8837.24s]  Sit, sit, sit, sit.
[8837.24s -> 8841.45s]  Should I sit?
[8841.45s -> 8860.74s]  Ah, nice.
[8860.74s -> 8864.69s]  Yes, we are quite quirky like that.
[8864.69s -> 8868.20s]  What did we do?
[8868.20s -> 8871.97s]  All right, I need, all right, let's just spin it.
[8871.97s -> 8876.10s]  And just put it over here.
[8876.10s -> 8884.68s]  And then this, oh, it's not correct.
[8884.68s -> 8890.32s]  Now I know why that hole exists.
[8890.32s -> 8901.08s]  I get the whole thing.
[8901.08s -> 8901.92s]  Okay.
[8904.43s -> 8916.16s]  Then, is there a good place to get this whole thing
[8916.16s -> 8921.92s]  on camera?
[8921.92s -> 8923.84s]  I hope the camera doesn't break.
[8933.93s -> 8936.09s]  Bond over a cat pet session or something.
[8937.56s -> 8939.96s]  I have heard petting is quite soothing.
[8943.10s -> 8944.26s]  It's probably right here.
[8944.26s -> 8948.30s]  Yeah.
[8948.30s -> 8952.25s]  Cool.
[8952.25s -> 8957.84s]  Simple.
[8957.84s -> 8959.44s]  You gonna play Armored Core?
[8959.44s -> 8961.32s]  I might.
[8961.32s -> 8964.32s]  I'm gonna try it, but I'm gonna be very, very honest.
[8964.32s -> 8970.06s]  I don't know if I'm gonna play it for a while.
[8970.06s -> 8971.26s]  I gave my take on it.
[8971.26s -> 8974.41s]  I'm definitely interested.
[8974.41s -> 8976.69s]  Okay, so, looking into this setup,
[8976.73s -> 8979.33s]  there's clearly something wrong with the system.
[8979.33s -> 8981.85s]  The deeper you go, the more the data are corrupt
[8981.85s -> 8983.57s]  due to lack of upkeep.
[8983.57s -> 8985.25s]  Definitely gonna do Sorcery later this week,
[8985.25s -> 8988.01s]  but there's a few things to do.
[8988.01s -> 8989.61s]  We'll see.
[8989.61s -> 8990.69s]  I'm interested in it.
[8992.41s -> 8995.29s]  You can tell my chin is currently pointing
[8995.29s -> 8996.97s]  straight down into my neck.
[8996.97s -> 8999.53s]  I'm leaning back because of, you know,
[8999.53s -> 9001.69s]  burp is a hiccup is here.
[9001.69s -> 9003.85s]  But besides that, yeah, I might play it.
[9017.08s -> 9020.64s]  Despite that, it's still wondrous.
[9020.64s -> 9028.52s]  Let's go, look at that.
[9028.52s -> 9033.50s]  Yeah, it definitely worked.
[9033.50s -> 9130.10s]  Ah, I can't be clever like that.
[9130.10s -> 9152.79s]  Oh, Jerma, hey, you're stupid.
[9152.79s -> 9156.79s]  Have you been moisturizing your neck?
[9156.79s -> 9163.53s]  Question is, have you?
[9163.53s -> 9165.09s]  Well, very clearly, I'm probably gonna shoot
[9165.09s -> 9168.24s]  from the bottom up.
[9168.24s -> 9173.92s]  How's this?
[9173.92s -> 9184.86s]  Just don't wanna cut it off.
[9184.86s -> 9193.75s]  This should do it, right?
[9193.75s -> 9197.90s]  Yep.
[9197.90s -> 9207.80s]  I like these ones, these are fun.
[9207.80s -> 9215.60s]  Wait a minute.
[9215.60s -> 9216.80s]  Wait, what the?
[9216.80s -> 9217.64s]  What?
[9217.64s -> 9218.72s]  What?
[9218.72s -> 9220.95s]  What happened?
[9220.95s -> 9223.05s]  Where am I?
[9223.05s -> 9262.47s]  And what is down right now?
[9262.47s -> 9270.33s]  What?
[9270.33s -> 9273.12s]  I just tapped it so many times and it...
[9273.12s -> 9276.17s]  Okay, we're good.
[9276.17s -> 9280.45s]  Pray that you've been enjoying your explorations thus far.
[9280.45s -> 9282.94s]  I have been.
[9282.94s -> 9286.39s]  Thank you, cat.
[9286.39s -> 9288.79s]  Hamster powering his brain is getting tired.
[9294.64s -> 9297.72s]  That's such a rude comment, but it's funny.
[9297.72s -> 9301.19s]  So you get to stay.
[9301.19s -> 9302.03s]  You know what I mean?
[9302.03s -> 9304.87s]  That's a rude comment, but it was funny.
[9304.87s -> 9312.20s]  So you get to stay.
[9312.20s -> 9329.85s]  Oh, there's more.
[9329.85s -> 9331.97s]  There's many memories stored here.
[9331.97s -> 9334.37s]  Many impossible things.
[9334.37s -> 9335.21s]  Hmm.
[9337.53s -> 9338.53s]  Filter?
[9338.53s -> 9344.10s]  I like this filter.
[9344.10s -> 9350.24s]  Okay.
[9350.24s -> 9357.73s]  So I need to stand here to activate this.
[9357.73s -> 9358.93s]  Is that correct?
[9358.93s -> 9360.53s]  That is correct.
[9360.53s -> 9369.98s]  So I need to take a picture of this while this is activated.
[9369.98s -> 9373.28s]  That was the dumbest idea I've ever had.
[9373.28s -> 9376.09s]  Okay.
[9376.09s -> 9376.97s]  It's on a timer.
[9419.27s -> 9431.12s]  Okay, I had the right idea.
[9431.12s -> 9431.96s]  Get me in there.
[9431.96s -> 9468.69s]  Shit.
[9468.69s -> 9469.53s]  I'm just trying to go.
[9469.53s -> 9474.58s]  So I'm just trying to skip it.
[9474.58s -> 9475.82s]  I'm just trying to skip it.
[9476.34s -> 9489.71s]  You know what I mean?
[9497.92s -> 9499.24s]  Is this on a timer?
[9499.24s -> 9504.33s]  Okay, this is on a timer too.
[9504.33s -> 9505.45s]  No, it's not.
[9505.45s -> 9507.13s]  So it's just as simple as,
[9510.57s -> 9521.16s]  is it just this simple?
[9521.16s -> 9523.40s]  You're doing great, as Tony would say.
[9523.40s -> 9530.72s]  Thanks, Tony.
[9530.72s -> 9538.91s]  Blueprint.
[9548.43s -> 9557.58s]  I know what to do.
[9557.58s -> 9559.75s]  I know what to do.
[9559.75s -> 9563.64s]  Sort of.
[9604.77s -> 9608.41s]  Uh-oh.
[9608.41s -> 9612.76s]  That's not good.
[9612.76s -> 9648.08s]  Wait a minute.
[9648.12s -> 9648.96s]  I feel like I had it right,
[9648.96s -> 9659.16s]  but it's the wrong angle.
[9659.16s -> 9676.98s]  Did I actually have it right?
[9676.98s -> 9679.78s]  You are one brain blip away.
[9682.01s -> 9701.96s]  Like this?
[9701.96s -> 9704.48s]  Why won't that get powered?
[9704.48s -> 9724.56s]  I need more.
[9724.56s -> 9749.35s]  Oh, come on.
[9749.35s -> 9780.41s]  I'm touching it.
[9780.41s -> 9781.53s]  I only have one photo.
[9781.53s -> 9782.37s]  Shit.
[9782.37s -> 9783.45s]  I'm so close.
[9783.45s -> 9785.85s]  Somebody said I was one brain blip away.
[9791.69s -> 9792.53s]  It's not.
[9792.53s -> 9793.53s]  Just take a picture of this, right?
[9793.53s -> 9798.78s]  While it's, no, right?
[9798.78s -> 9801.28s]  This didn't work last time, did it?
[9801.28s -> 9817.65s]  No.
[9817.65s -> 9821.62s]  Stand on top of it and then grab.
[9821.62s -> 9822.46s]  What angle?
[9823.22s -> 9824.36s]  There's a certain angle I gotta get this from.
[9824.36s -> 9826.28s]  I don't know.
[9826.28s -> 9829.72s]  I'm trapped here.
[9829.72s -> 9832.89s]  Do I have to go up top?
[9832.89s -> 9835.38s]  No.
[9835.38s -> 9836.74s]  Walk through the problem slowly.
[9836.74s -> 9838.95s]  Okay.
[9838.95s -> 9842.24s]  There is a teleporter over there.
[9842.24s -> 9843.24s]  I have to stand on that.
[9843.24s -> 9861.26s]  I have one photo.
[9861.26s -> 9865.51s]  To do this, I have to depress this plate
[9865.51s -> 9870.11s]  while at the same time, this needs to be upright.
[9870.11s -> 9879.97s]  I feel like I did the last three very easily.
[9883.40s -> 9884.32s]  Everybody relax.
[9884.32s -> 9885.16s]  It's all right.
[9885.16s -> 9886.00s]  It's a puzzle game.
[9886.00s -> 9892.53s]  You're supposed to take time on some of these.
[9893.13s -> 9896.50s]  Why am I having trouble?
[9896.50s -> 9897.38s]  Wait, hold on.
[9897.38s -> 9898.22s]  There's a ladder.
[9908.27s -> 9910.44s]  Maybe.
[9910.44s -> 9911.28s]  Maybe.
[9916.16s -> 9917.84s]  No.
[9917.84s -> 9918.68s]  I need to get it all.
[9918.68s -> 9920.82s]  I need to get it in view.
[9920.82s -> 9923.61s]  The whole thing.
[9923.61s -> 9924.45s]  Shit.
[9924.45s -> 9925.65s]  I don't know.
[9925.65s -> 9928.73s]  This is gonna be so simple and I'm just not seeing it.
[9928.73s -> 9931.69s]  I did the hard ones without a problem,
[9931.69s -> 9933.69s]  but this one is just a head scratcher for me.
[9933.69s -> 9934.53s]  I don't know why.
[9937.29s -> 9938.13s]  I figured I got it.
[9938.13s -> 9938.97s]  I got it.
[9938.97s -> 9940.97s]  The sneeze actually made me know what to do.
[9940.97s -> 9942.13s]  I just had to jumble the brain around a little bit.
[9942.13s -> 9942.97s]  Okay.
[9942.97s -> 9947.64s]  It's over here.
[9947.64s -> 9949.95s]  You gotta take a picture of this.
[9952.92s -> 9953.76s]  Hold on.
[9953.76s -> 9954.60s]  I got it.
[9954.60s -> 9955.44s]  I got it.
[9955.44s -> 9960.04s]  I got it.
[9960.04s -> 9960.88s]  I got it.
[9960.88s -> 9961.72s]  I got it.
[9961.72s -> 9962.56s]  I got it.
[9962.56s -> 9963.40s]  I got it.
[9963.40s -> 9964.67s]  Hold on.
[9964.67s -> 9965.51s]  Hold on.
[9965.51s -> 9966.35s]  Hold on.
[9966.35s -> 9967.19s]  It's I have to do it like this.
[9967.19s -> 9971.24s]  Watch this.
[9971.24s -> 9972.08s]  Ready?
[9972.08s -> 9974.69s]  Hey, here it is.
[9974.69s -> 9975.53s]  All right.
[9975.53s -> 9976.37s]  Now I go over here up on top.
[9976.37s -> 9981.16s]  If I could get on the ladder, that'd be great.
[9981.16s -> 9986.20s]  And then that allows me to, if you check this out,
[9986.20s -> 9988.84s]  now I'm able to
[9991.65s -> 9995.87s]  fucking hit this.
[9995.87s -> 10006.40s]  I need to know the sneeze quick.
[10006.40s -> 10009.48s]  Is there another camera film that I'm not seeing somewhere?
[10009.48s -> 10035.76s]  Am I just overdoing this?
[10035.76s -> 10036.60s]  Shit.
[10036.60s -> 10038.96s]  This is the only one I've been stuck on for this long.
[10038.96s -> 10040.76s]  I've been playing this game for two and a half hours
[10040.76s -> 10041.96s]  and it's the only one.
[10041.96s -> 10050.16s]  I know it's simple, but I can't, what is it?
[10050.16s -> 10051.00s]  Don't tell me.
[10059.85s -> 10071.55s]  Oh, it didn't work.
[10071.55s -> 10080.20s]  Why did it not work?
[10080.20s -> 10081.32s]  Speed is impressive.
[10081.32s -> 10082.16s]  All right.
[10082.16s -> 10086.17s]  You can take him out of emote only.
[10086.17s -> 10088.10s]  Glad I sneezed.
[10088.10s -> 10089.10s]  I, okay.
[10089.10s -> 10092.06s]  Let me tell you what my problem with that solution was.
[10092.06s -> 10092.90s]  Stop.
[10092.90s -> 10094.22s]  Everybody hold on.
[10094.22s -> 10097.10s]  I took a picture of the thing when it was depressed
[10097.10s -> 10099.90s]  and when I went, it didn't go forward.
[10099.90s -> 10102.42s]  But when I took a picture of it, when it was timed,
[10102.42s -> 10103.98s]  the timer and you know what I mean?
[10103.98s -> 10108.40s]  That was not all right.
[10108.44s -> 10111.72s]  I took a picture of it when it was like this,
[10111.72s -> 10124.11s]  but it doesn't last.
[10124.11s -> 10125.95s]  See, I didn't know that's what it was.
[10125.95s -> 10126.79s]  You know what it is?
[10126.79s -> 10137.49s]  I did that one instantly.
[10137.49s -> 10139.29s]  You just almost killed me of laughter.
[10139.29s -> 10145.15s]  You just sitting there laughing your ass off at that.
[10145.15s -> 10147.51s]  You know that they're gonna study us
[10147.51s -> 10148.99s]  in a hundred years, right?
[10163.28s -> 10165.32s]  They're gonna study you.
[10165.32s -> 10166.96s]  Oh, stop.
[10166.96s -> 10167.88s]  Okay.
[10167.88s -> 10173.79s]  This is, I don't have the camera anymore.
[10173.79s -> 10174.63s]  Yeah.
[10174.63s -> 10176.57s]  What do you want to say to people in a hundred years?
[10177.29s -> 10178.09s]  So when some scientist is going through
[10178.09s -> 10179.57s]  like the thousands of hours,
[10179.57s -> 10182.37s]  the hundreds of millions of hours of streams
[10182.37s -> 10183.89s]  and videos and stuff,
[10183.89s -> 10185.41s]  they're gonna have, they might see this chat.
[10185.41s -> 10187.41s]  What would you like to say to the scientist
[10187.41s -> 10193.61s]  a hundred years from now?
[10193.61s -> 10199.20s]  Seeing a lot of fuck yous.
[10199.20s -> 10201.24s]  Now this scientist is gonna look at this and be like,
[10201.24s -> 10202.08s]  what?
[10202.08s -> 10203.60s]  How primitive were they?
[10203.60s -> 10205.36s]  They must've been very primitive.
[10205.36s -> 10208.88s]  They immediately on talking to a potential scientist
[10208.88s -> 10212.71s]  in the future, went right to vulgarities.
[10212.71s -> 10218.27s]  Primitive species.
[10219.19s -> 10220.03s]  Okay.
[10220.03s -> 10221.07s]  I can't look at that.
[10221.07s -> 10224.84s]  That actually was weird.
[10224.84s -> 10234.14s]  That was, that was too much for my head.
[10234.14s -> 10237.55s]  I really don't like this level at all.
[10237.55s -> 10238.39s]  If there was a button,
[10238.39s -> 10240.03s]  if I could press F5 and skip this level,
[10240.03s -> 10241.66s]  I would do it right now.
[10241.66s -> 10242.74s]  Not because I don't think it's interesting,
[10242.74s -> 10244.38s]  but because I don't think I can do it.
[10244.38s -> 10254.12s]  I don't think I can handle it.
[10254.12s -> 10263.95s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[10263.95s -> 10269.52s]  God.
[10269.52s -> 10270.36s]  Take your time.
[10270.36s -> 10271.20s]  You got it.
[10271.20s -> 10275.38s]  You beat Sekiro, remember?
[10275.38s -> 10276.22s]  Yeah, I did.
[10277.60s -> 10278.44s]  Thanks.
[10278.44s -> 10279.64s]  That was a nice chat message.
[10279.64s -> 10280.48s]  I appreciate that.
[10280.48s -> 10281.32s]  Thank you.
[10289.23s -> 10290.24s]  Oh.
[10293.44s -> 10295.32s]  Was I supposed to get fooled somehow?
[10295.32s -> 10297.88s]  Oh, I was.
[10297.88s -> 10304.93s]  Wait.
[10304.93s -> 10309.60s]  I think that was supposed to fool me.
[10310.52s -> 10316.59s]  Just making sure it's not going to do that again.
[10352.93s -> 10368.12s]  Oh, get over there.
[10368.12s -> 10368.96s]  Whoa.
[10368.96s -> 10369.92s]  Oh, that.
[10369.92s -> 10375.20s]  All right.
[10375.84s -> 10378.20s]  Somebody on the dev team is a magician.
[10378.20s -> 10379.76s]  Can I make that?
[10379.76s -> 10380.72s]  Can I say that?
[10380.72s -> 10381.92s]  I'm going to say that.
[10381.92s -> 10385.44s]  Somebody on the dev team, I think, is a magician.
[10385.44s -> 10387.92s]  Like, they know how to do magic and stuff.
[10387.92s -> 10388.76s]  You know what I mean?
[10388.76s -> 10397.67s]  I think someone's a magician.
[10397.67s -> 10399.31s]  Like card trick.
[10399.31s -> 10400.15s]  Hey, look.
[10400.15s -> 10401.47s]  The salt shaker on the table disappeared.
[10401.47s -> 10403.43s]  That type of magician.
[10403.43s -> 10404.27s]  Yeah.
[10404.27s -> 10405.11s]  Oh, yeah.
[10405.11s -> 10405.95s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[10405.95s -> 10406.79s]  Somebody's a magician.
[10406.79s -> 10414.43s]  And I'm curious.
[10414.43s -> 10420.65s]  These are little sleight of hand tricks.
[10420.65s -> 10426.40s]  Okay.
[10428.97s -> 10430.05s]  That's, okay.
[10430.05s -> 10431.29s]  That's cool.
[10431.29s -> 10434.17s]  Don't even try to tell me that that's not interesting,
[10434.17s -> 10435.41s]  what we're looking at.
[10435.41s -> 10445.15s]  Because that's really cool.
[10445.15s -> 10445.99s]  All right.
[10445.99s -> 10454.08s]  It is not what it seems.
[10454.08s -> 10454.92s]  Yep.
[10454.92s -> 10455.76s]  Uh-huh.
[10455.76s -> 10457.84s]  Cool.
[10457.84s -> 10461.59s]  That's just, has that just been here?
[10461.59s -> 10468.03s]  Weird.
[10468.03s -> 10468.87s]  All right.
[10468.87s -> 10469.71s]  Now what?
[10469.71s -> 10470.91s]  Is it saying to go down?
[10470.91s -> 10478.12s]  What, what are we going to, what's the reveal?
[10478.12s -> 10502.51s]  Ah, it's stimulating his monkey brain.
[10502.51s -> 10510.54s]  Should I just fall?
[10510.54s -> 10512.54s]  Ah, that wasn't part of the trick.
[10512.54s -> 10513.38s]  That wasn't part of the trick.
[10513.38s -> 10516.02s]  He went the wrong way.
[10516.02s -> 10517.18s]  He's gone.
[10519.05s -> 10521.17s]  He was supposed to go in the door over here.
[10521.17s -> 10524.60s]  He just walked up the cliff.
[10524.60s -> 10527.41s]  Um, watch your step.
[10527.41s -> 10530.64s]  What is it trying to tell me?
[10530.64s -> 10537.52s]  Wrap around and jump this way?
[10537.52s -> 10538.36s]  Intriguing.
[10538.36s -> 10539.20s]  Okay.
[10539.20s -> 10541.09s]  Then from here,
[10541.09s -> 10544.55s]  I'm imagining there's probably a false floor here
[10544.55s -> 10545.75s]  that I fall.
[10545.75s -> 10556.20s]  Don't jump, don't jump, don't jump.
[10556.20s -> 10560.27s]  It's telling me to kind of wrap around and fall?
[10564.78s -> 10570.30s]  What is it saying?
[10570.30s -> 10572.58s]  Like go right around a circle
[10572.58s -> 10574.94s]  and then left around the top left circle
[10574.94s -> 10582.18s]  and then straight down.
[10582.18s -> 10598.36s]  Are these directions or is this something else?
[10598.36s -> 10605.48s]  I feel like this is correct.
[10605.48s -> 10606.32s]  No.
[10625.01s -> 10630.20s]  No, I was down here already, wasn't I?
[10630.20s -> 10643.38s]  Yeah, I was already down here.
[10643.38s -> 10647.90s]  Watch your step.
[10647.90s -> 10649.50s]  Is there just a hole in the ground over here
[10649.50s -> 10674.01s]  that I'm not seeing?
[10674.01s -> 10679.38s]  Filtration system proofs for how long?
[10679.42s -> 10682.36s]  Let me sit down for a second.
[10682.36s -> 10698.79s]  What is this trying to tell me?
[10698.79s -> 10709.20s]  I came in this way.
[10709.20s -> 10714.20s]  The only logical way is over here, right?
[10714.20s -> 10716.80s]  Like this, out this way?
[10716.80s -> 10723.15s]  No.
[10723.15s -> 10726.04s]  I was imagining like right here.
[10726.04s -> 10732.07s]  And then you watch your step.
[10732.07s -> 10746.14s]  No.
[10746.14s -> 10746.98s]  I'm kind of stumped.
[10746.98s -> 10749.51s]  I wonder if it's very simple.
[10749.51s -> 10764.23s]  What does this mean?
[10764.23s -> 10784.72s]  Come on, teleport me down.
[10784.72s -> 10788.19s]  Fuck, I thought that was gonna be it.
[10788.19s -> 10789.51s]  Trace it and then by the,
[10789.51s -> 10799.48s]  your movements of the mouse will bring you down.
[10799.48s -> 10802.74s]  Hold on, let me drink some of my drink.
[10802.74s -> 10805.40s]  You're a clown, you're a clown.
[10805.40s -> 10806.24s]  You're not saying that,
[10806.84s -> 10817.72s]  but that's what I'm getting from the emote.
[10817.72s -> 10820.14s]  Shit.
[10820.14s -> 10837.23s]  Why is there no edge here?
[10837.23s -> 10838.56s]  Ooh, look.
[10838.56s -> 10839.40s]  Look at these.
[10839.40s -> 10842.68s]  Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[10842.68s -> 10843.52s]  Here we go.
[10843.52s -> 10848.82s]  All right, so it was,
[10848.82s -> 10849.78s]  I don't remember what was,
[10849.78s -> 10854.75s]  oh, don't go that far back.
[10854.75s -> 10860.48s]  All right, so it's around the bottom right,
[10860.48s -> 10867.80s]  loop around the top left, straight out.
[10867.80s -> 10871.26s]  Cool.
[10871.26s -> 10890.12s]  All right, sneaky, sneaky.
[10890.12s -> 10891.12s]  He's got yellow brain.
[10891.12s -> 10894.68s]  I don't know what he's talking about the pillars.
[10894.72s -> 10895.56s]  Don't let them bully you.
[10895.56s -> 10896.72s]  You did good.
[10896.72s -> 10903.32s]  I think I did fine.
[10903.32s -> 10904.16s]  How many batteries?
[10904.16s -> 10905.31s]  Two or three?
[10905.31s -> 10923.54s]  One, really?
[10923.54s -> 10941.68s]  It was never gonna be that easy, was it?
[10941.68s -> 10964.32s]  How do I get in there?
[10964.32s -> 10965.16s]  Oh, God damn it.
[10965.16s -> 10966.32s]  It's a fake wall.
[10966.32s -> 10974.97s]  Okay, that doesn't look right.
[10974.97s -> 10994.87s]  Wait, this does not look right.
[10994.87s -> 11005.22s]  I have to take a picture of it before I go reveal it.
[11005.22s -> 11006.06s]  I have to take a picture of it.
[11006.06s -> 11057.95s]  I think I know what to do.
[11057.95s -> 11064.84s]  I like, I know what to do.
[11064.84s -> 11074.17s]  I know what to do.
[11074.17s -> 11075.32s]  Watch this.
[11075.32s -> 11089.36s]  Ready?
[11089.36s -> 11102.40s]  Wait a minute.
[11102.40s -> 11104.72s]  I wanna like spin this.
[11104.72s -> 11108.12s]  How do I spin it?
[11108.12s -> 11138.64s]  This?
[11138.64s -> 11139.48s]  Tricky.
[11141.27s -> 11143.31s]  But even if I rotate it, will that matter?
[11143.31s -> 11180.75s]  It's not real.
[11180.75s -> 11193.06s]  Hey, what happened to it?
[11193.06s -> 11196.51s]  Where did it go?
[11196.51s -> 11197.52s]  What?
[11197.52s -> 11198.40s]  Oh my goodness.
[11198.40s -> 11212.04s]  I don't know what's going on.
[11212.04s -> 11215.15s]  So I have to make it active, get a picture of it
[11215.15s -> 11224.12s]  and then rotate it and take a picture of it again.
[11224.12s -> 11238.76s]  Wait.
[11238.76s -> 11239.60s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[11239.60s -> 11244.16s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11244.16s -> 11251.50s]  I have to touch it from the front.
[11251.50s -> 11269.97s]  That might be all right.
[11269.97s -> 11272.66s]  I get it, but I don't.
[11272.66s -> 11289.16s]  I get it, but I don't.
[11289.16s -> 11298.05s]  Does that work?
[11298.05s -> 11306.36s]  Shit.
[11306.36s -> 11307.20s]  Fuck it.
[11307.20s -> 11308.80s]  I don't know.
[11310.10s -> 11312.71s]  I get it, but I don't.
[11312.71s -> 11313.91s]  I have to take a picture of it
[11313.91s -> 11318.24s]  when it's right facing right at the camera.
[11318.24s -> 11325.09s]  How do I get it to move without it being the wrong direction?
[11325.09s -> 11327.33s]  I have a different idea.
[11327.33s -> 11330.24s]  Let me try this.
[11330.24s -> 11335.25s]  I do what I just did and then I take a picture of it
[11335.25s -> 11338.92s]  and then I put it the other direction.
[11338.92s -> 11346.41s]  Let me try that.
[11346.41s -> 11350.26s]  So now what happens if I do this?
[11350.26s -> 11353.66s]  Will it be facing the right way?
[11353.66s -> 11354.50s]  Do you know what I mean by this?
[11354.50s -> 11363.22s]  You see what I'm doing?
[11363.22s -> 11367.90s]  I mean, that's correct, but it's not right.
[11368.70s -> 11371.16s]  It's kind of correct.
[11371.16s -> 11372.32s]  What if I just, can I drop it?
[11372.32s -> 11373.16s]  Will it fall out?
[11373.16s -> 11381.35s]  No.
[11381.35s -> 11388.36s]  Ah, this is a, this is a stumper.
[11388.36s -> 11390.48s]  Like, well, can I, will it just, it's not falling.
[11390.48s -> 11400.02s]  Wait a minute.
[11400.02s -> 11405.56s]  That's not what I have to do, is it?
[11405.56s -> 11407.18s]  There's nothing there.
[11407.18s -> 11412.13s]  It's, the shit's empty.
[11412.13s -> 11412.97s]  There's nothing.
[11412.97s -> 11415.41s]  Ah, huh?
[11415.41s -> 11416.41s]  There's nothing there.
[11416.41s -> 11422.24s]  I would have tried that.
[11422.24s -> 11424.16s]  I would have just, I would have tried to do that.
[11424.16s -> 11436.11s]  What the hell?
[11436.11s -> 11438.28s]  I would have probably tried that.
[11438.28s -> 11441.84s]  Oh, what?
[11441.84s -> 11442.68s]  Well, okay.
[11448.95s -> 11449.79s]  Oh, I beat it.
[11455.50s -> 11457.17s]  Was it bugged?
[11457.17s -> 11458.09s]  It was bugged.
[11458.09s -> 11459.53s]  It was bugged.
[11459.53s -> 11461.97s]  Wow, okay, that makes sense.
[11461.97s -> 11465.32s]  I was wondering, I was like, why is it not there?
[11465.32s -> 11467.36s]  I thought I had to touch it for then it to be active
[11467.36s -> 11469.80s]  that it would be there.
[11469.80s -> 11472.36s]  All right, I want to do the super secret level.
[11472.36s -> 11478.95s]  Where is it?
[11478.95s -> 11489.44s]  All the way up?
[11489.44s -> 11493.66s]  It was there one time where it didn't show up.
[11493.66s -> 11495.10s]  Yeah, I thought that was a bug
[11495.10s -> 11497.30s]  that it wasn't supposed to be there when it flashed.
[11497.30s -> 11499.18s]  So I was like, oh, that was a bug that it was not,
[11499.54s -> 11503.08s]  that it's not supposed to be there.
[11506.98s -> 11508.58s]  There's no optional level here?
[11508.58s -> 11509.54s]  Oh, okay.
[11509.54s -> 11512.95s]  Let's go.
[11512.95s -> 11515.33s]  I'm going to take a quick break.
[11515.33s -> 11516.33s]  Looks like we have,
[11518.37s -> 11520.17s]  we have a pretty decent amount left.
[11521.05s -> 11522.41s]  Two more chapters.
[11522.41s -> 11523.25s]  I will be right back.
[11523.25s -> 11525.25s]  I'm going to pee, refill my drink.
[11525.25s -> 11856.04s]  See you guys in a minute.
[11856.04s -> 11862.49s]  Looks like we got two more, oh, wow, what a blunder.
[11862.53s -> 11864.56s]  Give me one more second.
[11864.56s -> 11866.58s]  My drink, the other room.
[11866.58s -> 12014.80s]  Give me one second.
[12016.52s -> 12018.44s]  Cookies.
[12018.44s -> 12030.87s]  I want cookies.
[12030.87s -> 12033.69s]  Keep going.
[12033.69s -> 12039.67s]  So this is chapter four.
[12039.67s -> 12040.51s]  Let's go.
[12040.51s -> 12042.46s]  Mirren's workspace awaits.
[12042.46s -> 12046.94s]  She's rather special who started all of this
[12046.94s -> 12049.02s]  with good intentions, no less.
[12049.02s -> 12053.80s]  She even made me, and for that, I will always be thankful.
[12053.80s -> 12063.80s]  Even though she, she really loved this place.
[12063.80s -> 12076.89s]  How many blinkers did you just hit?
[12076.89s -> 12079.59s]  Oh, this one's cool.
[12079.59s -> 12080.43s]  Observatory.
[12086.96s -> 12088.66s]  It's different, isn't it?
[12088.66s -> 12091.06s]  Mirren was passionate about her studies.
[12103.20s -> 12108.65s]  I love the music in here.
[12108.65s -> 12114.69s]  Pretty relaxing.
[12114.69s -> 12117.08s]  Okay, let's go.
[12117.08s -> 12122.06s]  What mechanic are they going to introduce now?
[12122.06s -> 12129.25s]  Two batteries?
[12129.25s -> 12133.92s]  Why are the batteries different?
[12133.92s -> 12136.00s]  It's spreading, I'm concerned.
[12136.00s -> 12139.76s]  Is this a regular battery?
[12139.76s -> 12145.26s]  Why is it so, oh, that's what makes it so weird.
[12146.10s -> 12169.16s]  You can't take a picture of these phantom batteries.
[12169.16s -> 12178.83s]  Oh, whatever, just put it right here.
[12185.94s -> 12187.30s]  That was just a cough.
[12187.30s -> 12189.78s]  That was just a regular cough.
[12189.78s -> 12191.22s]  It was a regular cough.
[12191.22s -> 12193.70s]  It had nothing, it had nothing to do
[12193.70s -> 12197.38s]  with any of the things that you're talking about.
[12197.38s -> 12198.90s]  It was just a little, okay.
[12198.90s -> 12200.76s]  You know what the cough is from?
[12200.76s -> 12204.28s]  I just drank a bunch of kefir and it's just settling
[12204.28s -> 12205.40s]  and it was like, okay, it's settled
[12205.40s -> 12207.80s]  and I had to clear my throat a little.
[12207.80s -> 12222.52s]  That's it.
[12222.52s -> 12230.07s]  Can I pick up everything or just the kefir?
[12230.07s -> 12232.79s]  If kefir is, oh, hold on.
[12232.79s -> 12235.20s]  People are talking about snacks.
[12235.20s -> 12239.74s]  Saying, hey, hey, what's your snack of choice right now?
[12239.74s -> 12249.72s]  Kefir is another one?
[12249.72s -> 12258.60s]  Wait, okay, so that can remove that gray stuff.
[12263.64s -> 12271.37s]  There it is, cool.
[12271.37s -> 12280.39s]  Um, what do I take a picture of?
[12280.39s -> 12282.11s]  This is incredible.
[12282.11s -> 12285.07s]  The system is self-learning and ever-growing.
[12285.07s -> 12286.95s]  It can be used to build structures,
[12286.95s -> 12289.63s]  new buildings, support it on its own energy.
[12289.63s -> 12291.83s]  This could truly help push the principles
[12291.83s -> 12293.39s]  of my research to new heights.
[12294.39s -> 12301.20s]  I need to show this to Haria immediately.
[12301.20s -> 12306.41s]  Excited.
[12306.41s -> 12336.73s]  Um, what am I missing here?
[12336.73s -> 12338.71s]  What?
[12338.71s -> 12345.42s]  That's not what I took a picture of.
[12345.42s -> 12360.16s]  I wanted to roll this down the stairs.
[12360.16s -> 12362.12s]  Okay, what?
[12362.12s -> 12401.68s]  So I'm supposed to clear something with this.
[12401.68s -> 12421.96s]  The teleporter, what the hell is going on?
[12422.00s -> 12424.35s]  I take a picture of the, this right here?
[12424.35s -> 12427.05s]  I'm like, what is, okay.
[12427.05s -> 12431.68s]  So can I, I don't know, can I walk up this or something?
[12431.68s -> 12488.72s]  Where's the game progress?
[12488.72s -> 12497.18s]  Um, I don't know.
[12497.18s -> 12500.94s]  Oh, Matt, I probably have to climb up this, right?
[12500.94s -> 12513.56s]  Somewhere?
[12513.56s -> 12517.28s]  Hi, okay.
[12518.89s -> 12526.10s]  I, again, I'm playing chess
[12526.10s -> 12545.55s]  when I should be playing checkers.
[12545.55s -> 12552.60s]  There is the end of the phone call.
[12552.60s -> 12555.50s]  He made it, I'm so happy.
[12555.50s -> 12556.94s]  Nice work.
[12557.46s -> 12558.70s]  Appreciate the view, you made this,
[12558.70s -> 12560.10s]  you can master anything.
[12566.46s -> 12568.30s]  The weather disruptor.
[12571.38s -> 12572.58s]  We're gonna make, um,
[12574.34s -> 12575.78s]  weather machine or something?
[12580.32s -> 12582.75s]  I need film for the camera.
[12582.75s -> 12583.59s]  Oh, hi, can we reach?
[12583.59s -> 12591.22s]  Not even the sky can limit us.
[12591.22s -> 12595.15s]  All right, there's a, something over there.
[12595.15s -> 12600.39s]  Looking for film for the camera.
[12600.43s -> 12603.20s]  Okay, is that film?
[12603.20s -> 12604.68s]  Nice milk voice.
[12604.68s -> 12615.98s]  Yeah, yeah.
[12615.98s -> 12616.82s]  Here we go.
[12616.82s -> 12618.31s]  I'm sure you noticed by now,
[12618.31s -> 12621.84s]  using film was always Mirren's idea,
[12621.84s -> 12627.95s]  one of her many passions.
[12627.95s -> 12638.44s]  All right, now make the bridge to the film.
[12638.44s -> 12641.48s]  That's the fucking worst bridge
[12641.48s -> 12645.67s]  I've ever made in a video game.
[12645.67s -> 12653.76s]  That has to be the worst bridge I've ever done.
[12653.76s -> 12663.57s]  I, okay, everything's fine
[12663.57s -> 12696.92s]  because you need to do it like that.
[12697.36s -> 12698.20s]  I know what to do.
[12698.20s -> 12712.17s]  You gotta go down here.
[12712.17s -> 12738.29s]  Enough solution.
[12738.29s -> 12739.37s]  What do you mean, dude?
[12739.37s -> 12740.89s]  I have it right.
[12740.89s -> 12773.00s]  I just didn't do it in the right spot.
[12773.00s -> 12784.13s]  Hey, I made it.
[12784.13s -> 12786.56s]  Look at that.
[12799.47s -> 12801.03s]  Five pictures, oh boy.
[12801.03s -> 12804.20s]  This is gonna take a lot of brain power.
[12804.20s -> 12807.84s]  This might be the one.
[12807.84s -> 12813.48s]  Okay, five photos.
[12813.48s -> 12814.32s]  What do we got?
[12814.32s -> 12821.90s]  We got a foil, two batteries, and a cage.
[12821.90s -> 12824.61s]  Okay, I need to take pictures of batteries
[12824.61s -> 12828.12s]  and drop them in here.
[12828.12s -> 12833.64s]  Go look for those first.
[12833.64s -> 12840.62s]  Use, useless junk for play with.
[12840.62s -> 12872.06s]  That's not a battery all the way over there, is it?
[12872.06s -> 12875.81s]  Nobody said they wanted to bet on that.
[12875.81s -> 12879.36s]  You would have lost.
[12879.36s -> 12883.09s]  Let's take a selfie and clone yourself.
[12883.09s -> 12884.09s]  Well, I'd have to set the camera up
[12884.09s -> 12886.12s]  and get my entire body though.
[12886.12s -> 12892.41s]  Otherwise it would just be awful.
[12892.41s -> 12899.60s]  One battery, that's it.
[12899.60s -> 12911.75s]  Dude, you're a lot smarter now that you have a job.
[12911.75s -> 12914.19s]  Oh no, he has to use his brain every day.
[12914.19s -> 12916.39s]  This is, I don't like this anymore.
[12921.48s -> 12924.26s]  Okay, so what do we do with this?
[12924.26s -> 12929.07s]  How about cupcakes?
[12929.07s -> 12940.82s]  How about, how about cupcakes?
[12941.06s -> 12948.71s]  Whoa, shit.
[12948.71s -> 12969.24s]  Um, well, interesting.
[12969.24s -> 12975.79s]  I need to go down and put it like there.
[12975.79s -> 12986.55s]  Oh, uh, what's going on here?
[12986.55s -> 13045.01s]  Jesus, I didn't want to do that.
[13045.01s -> 13049.36s]  I have to drop it from here and catch it.
[13049.48s -> 13051.16s]  Drop it from here and catch it.
[13073.95s -> 13081.30s]  No, I'm going to do something insane.
[13081.30s -> 13083.76s]  It's going to work.
[13083.76s -> 13085.16s]  It's going to work.
[13085.16s -> 13093.25s]  Check this out.
[13093.25s -> 13103.37s]  Okay, watch this.
[13103.37s -> 13122.18s]  So far so good.
[13122.18s -> 13123.14s]  What the fuck?
[13123.14s -> 13127.56s]  This is not what I thought that was.
[13127.56s -> 13129.04s]  Oh, I thought this was flat.
[13129.04s -> 13133.15s]  I thought this was a flat painting.
[13133.15s -> 13137.48s]  Oh boy, that's makes everything different now.
[13137.48s -> 13142.94s]  Okay, well, my plan was not a good one then.
[13142.94s -> 13148.04s]  My plan was really bad.
[13148.04s -> 13163.21s]  Knowing that, I, I, I, I don't know.
[13165.38s -> 13178.32s]  Is something in here that I can get?
[13178.32s -> 13182.30s]  The, the, the, the beats.
[13182.30s -> 13189.92s]  Yeah, okay, more film and a ball.
[13189.92s -> 13194.04s]  I guess maybe this, does that make sense?
[13194.04s -> 13200.77s]  Sense, does that make sense what I just did?
[13200.77s -> 13224.00s]  How do I get out of here then?
[13224.00s -> 13231.74s]  Um, shit, I don't really know what to do here.
[13231.74s -> 13237.77s]  I guess I could, I have to like replace
[13237.77s -> 13243.08s]  this whole level with this thing, kind of.
[13243.08s -> 13247.87s]  I'm going to try my stupid idea.
[13248.63s -> 13263.47s]  My idea is really dumb.
[13263.47s -> 13278.60s]  It's my idea is actually completely moronic.
[13278.60s -> 13324.80s]  Like this is the worst idea I've ever had.
[13324.80s -> 13326.60s]  What do I do?
[13326.60s -> 13333.88s]  Um, not over here, right?
[13333.88s -> 13342.12s]  I wish I could move it forward and backwards.
[13342.12s -> 13345.05s]  I mean, catching this makes the most sense,
[13345.05s -> 13350.20s]  but then how do I get out of there?
[13350.20s -> 13402.74s]  I mean, how do I get out of there?
[13402.74s -> 13414.88s]  What a fucking mess, but I think it's going to work.
[13415.88s -> 13417.82s]  I actually think I just did it.
[13417.82s -> 13419.98s]  Yeah, I think I got it.
[13420.06s -> 13425.10s]  Did I?
[13425.10s -> 13426.18s]  It's right there.
[13426.18s -> 13427.22s]  It's the right idea.
[13427.22s -> 13460.11s]  Hold on.
[13460.11s -> 13462.19s]  How can we be silent?
[13462.19s -> 13464.87s]  I'm, I'm trying to concentrate.
[13464.87s -> 13470.69s]  It's, this is a lot of brain power.
[13470.69s -> 13472.13s]  What pictures did I take?
[13472.13s -> 13474.93s]  Why is there a whole fucking building over here?
[13474.93s -> 13476.29s]  What is all this?
[13476.29s -> 13477.65s]  What is all that?
[13477.65s -> 13478.77s]  I'm so confused.
[13478.77s -> 13503.33s]  I wanted just a picture of the tile.
[13503.33s -> 13512.03s]  Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[13512.15s -> 13514.23s]  Okay, okay.
[13514.23s -> 13516.79s]  Yeah, yeah, it sure is.
[13516.79s -> 13518.27s]  It sure is that, isn't it?
[13519.71s -> 13520.55s]  Okay.
[13520.55s -> 13521.88s]  I was wondering how you would call this.
[13521.88s -> 13526.85s]  That was so long.
[13526.85s -> 13528.45s]  Oh, that was so long.
[13528.45s -> 13531.53s]  That took so, I was going to build a whole structure
[13531.53s -> 13536.19s]  to pick that up and walk it all the way back.
[13536.19s -> 13550.88s]  Wow, I can't believe it.
[13550.88s -> 13556.68s]  Okay, we're good.
[13556.68s -> 13557.60s]  Chill stream tonight?
[13557.60s -> 13560.95s]  Yeah, I'm, I'm just hanging out.
[13560.95s -> 13563.75s]  I'm having a good time.
[13563.75s -> 13576.76s]  Okay, here's the problem.
[13576.76s -> 13609.76s]  How do I get them both?
[13609.76s -> 13618.44s]  Hmm, can I get around?
[13618.44s -> 13619.48s]  What is this here for?
[13619.48s -> 13673.16s]  This has got to be here for a reason, right?
[13673.16s -> 13681.99s]  I only have one picture.
[13681.99s -> 13684.95s]  I have one photo to take.
[13684.95s -> 13691.87s]  I just don't know what to take it of.
[13691.87s -> 13696.89s]  You want me to take a picture right up here, don't you?
[13696.89s -> 13712.87s]  All right, I get a picture of the sky.
[13712.87s -> 13714.03s]  That's not what they wanted.
[13714.03s -> 13725.54s]  Okay.
[13725.54s -> 13728.06s]  I'm going to get it right here.
[13728.06s -> 13729.18s]  I just did it.
[13729.18s -> 13730.02s]  I just did it.
[13730.02s -> 13734.62s]  Watch this.
[13734.62s -> 13735.46s]  Watch this shit.
[13735.46s -> 13737.30s]  You think, you guys think I'm fucking around right now?
[13737.30s -> 13738.22s]  You think I'm fucking around?
[13738.22s -> 13785.76s]  Watch this.
[13786.32s -> 13791.57s]  I got, I'm going to get it right here.
[13791.57s -> 13797.36s]  Oh, come on.
[13797.36s -> 13813.64s]  If I only had another shot to take.
[13813.64s -> 13818.84s]  I'm so, it's so far away.
[13818.84s -> 13822.29s]  It's right here, but it's just not right here.
[13861.96s -> 13863.32s]  Press it.
[13863.32s -> 13864.59s]  Press it.
[13864.59s -> 13866.64s]  Press it.
[13866.64s -> 13868.97s]  Press it.
[13868.97s -> 13871.01s]  What's up?
[13871.01s -> 13877.23s]  What's up, cat?
[13877.23s -> 13882.47s]  Huh?
[13882.47s -> 13883.73s]  What do you mean?
[13883.73s -> 13894.09s]  What's wrong with it?
[13894.09s -> 13895.17s]  Fuck you.
[13895.17s -> 13896.45s]  God damn it.
[13896.45s -> 13907.26s]  I just learned that by doing, we're good.
[13907.26s -> 13910.49s]  Everything's fine.
[13910.49s -> 13917.36s]  You take the picture through the wall.
[13917.36s -> 13920.30s]  Is this your solution to heal the world?
[13920.30s -> 13921.74s]  Brute forcing the puzzle.
[13921.74s -> 13927.00s]  Well, hey, we all have different ways of learning.
[13927.00s -> 13929.36s]  My way of learning was jumping off the side of the building
[13929.36s -> 13931.96s]  and trying to take a picture of it while it came into view
[13931.96s -> 13936.96s]  to then slide down it while falling to my death.
[13936.96s -> 13939.40s]  And you can just take pictures through walls.
[13939.40s -> 13944.76s]  So, but I figured that out because I did that hypothesis.
[13944.80s -> 13952.80s]  So I figured it out still.
[13952.80s -> 13953.64s]  All right, this will be interesting.
[13953.64s -> 13957.32s]  What, where am I going?
[13957.32s -> 13963.27s]  This one, we're doing the same thing we did before.
[13963.27s -> 13965.07s]  I've already learned.
[13965.07s -> 13967.40s]  I already know what's happening.
[13967.40s -> 13969.67s]  I already got it.
[13969.67s -> 13971.39s]  Pretty much a done deal already.
[13994.56s -> 14000.35s]  There we go.
[14000.35s -> 14001.91s]  Stop with the pictures already.
[14005.74s -> 14006.74s]  It's the whole game.
[14009.04s -> 14010.71s]  I'm going to go cold.
[14010.71s -> 14018.22s]  I like the cold colors.
[14018.22s -> 14020.42s]  Optional challenge.
[14020.42s -> 14041.53s]  I want to take a look at it.
[14041.53s -> 14043.25s]  There's gotta be a way, right?
[14043.25s -> 14047.55s]  Hold on.
[14047.55s -> 14052.81s]  Come on, there's gotta be a way to take,
[14052.81s -> 14060.70s]  to keep this going infinitely.
[14060.70s -> 14075.48s]  I don't think there is.
[14075.48s -> 14085.74s]  Is there another one?
[14085.74s -> 14094.14s]  Oh, wait, is this just very simple?
[14094.14s -> 14130.23s]  Oh, I need, wait a minute.
[14130.23s -> 14141.04s]  There it is.
[14141.04s -> 14142.28s]  One, two, three.
[14142.28s -> 14157.68s]  Wait, I need one, yeah, one more.
[14157.68s -> 14159.94s]  Did I cheat?
[14159.94s -> 14164.72s]  No, I think that's what you're supposed to do though.
[14164.72s -> 14167.82s]  That was a fun one, I liked that one.
[14167.82s -> 14172.50s]  New camera filter, painting.
[14172.50s -> 14182.61s]  I'm kind of curious about that.
[14182.61s -> 14186.93s]  Does it look much different?
[14187.57s -> 14188.77s]  How do you even program this?
[14188.77s -> 14190.68s]  That's what I'm saying.
[14190.68s -> 14198.01s]  That's wild.
[14198.01s -> 14208.90s]  All right, somebody can take a screenshot of that.
[14210.23s -> 14213.59s]  Music, I must admit, magnificent with the guitar.
[14213.59s -> 14216.56s]  She's promised to come play for us here again.
[14216.56s -> 14217.56s]  I have more tests to perform
[14217.56s -> 14220.04s]  before sharing my theories with the others.
[14220.04s -> 14221.04s]  I haven't felt disinvigorated
[14221.04s -> 14222.96s]  since my first successful Violet build.
[14222.96s -> 14227.68s]  All right.
[14227.68s -> 14229.26s]  All right, coil.
[14229.26s -> 14232.37s]  A lot of coils.
[14232.37s -> 14233.73s]  Far too many coils in this one.
[14233.73s -> 14234.57s]  So I have to power all,
[14234.57s -> 14239.89s]  I gotta power up all these.
[14240.89s -> 14242.85s]  It's interesting, that's for sure.
[14242.85s -> 14245.05s]  All right, this one is powered.
[14247.29s -> 14249.93s]  The radio is what powers the coils.
[14253.66s -> 14259.11s]  Okay, so here's what we're gonna do.
[14259.11s -> 14286.40s]  Try it the simplest way possible.
[14286.40s -> 14293.95s]  Shit.
[14293.95s -> 14308.18s]  Ugh, no.
[14308.18s -> 14316.88s]  That's them all, yep, nice.
[14316.88s -> 14319.42s]  I got a flow, I'm in the zone right now.
[14332.28s -> 14335.58s]  Okay, coils.
[14336.26s -> 14339.12s]  This is lever.
[14339.12s -> 14343.62s]  All right, so I need a radio box to go right here.
[14343.62s -> 14345.30s]  The hamster is running, oh yeah.
[14351.44s -> 14354.80s]  A beat that just makes you wanna get up and dance.
[14354.80s -> 14362.09s]  And also power a teleporter over here.
[14362.09s -> 14371.55s]  All right, is that it?
[14371.55s -> 14379.46s]  Oh, that's it, but wait, there's one over here.
[14379.46s -> 14383.50s]  Oh, no, that's it, there's one.
[14383.50s -> 14392.81s]  5G audio.
[14392.81s -> 14403.97s]  Telephone, telephone, telephone, telephone, telephone.
[14403.97s -> 14412.11s]  Wait, I can't take a picture of that.
[14412.11s -> 14413.87s]  Good to hear from you, bud.
[14413.91s -> 14421.04s]  Okay, so this is a photo.
[14421.04s -> 14421.88s]  I get it.
[14421.88s -> 14424.41s]  All right, so I have a camera, right?
[14444.64s -> 14452.52s]  Yeah, okay.
[14452.52s -> 14462.97s]  I'm really rolling on this one.
[14462.97s -> 14471.94s]  Five pictures, I wonder if it's just timer, right?
[14471.94s -> 14480.89s]  Oh, this is gonna be easy, watch this.
[14480.89s -> 14515.89s]  Nevermind.
[14523.26s -> 14525.34s]  Light travel, sound travels, light pulse sound
[14525.34s -> 14549.64s]  equals kinematics of weather events using light and sound.
[14549.64s -> 14550.52s]  I think I have an idea, ready?
[14550.52s -> 14562.96s]  Watch this, and let me look around.
[14562.96s -> 14564.92s]  Can I play something on here?
[14564.92s -> 14572.20s]  I don't think so.
[14572.20s -> 14574.90s]  I think I have to stick it closer and closer.
[14574.90s -> 14588.40s]  How?
[14592.95s -> 14598.19s]  Oh, yep, watch this.
[14598.19s -> 14641.93s]  That's definitely how I'm gonna do it.
[14641.93s -> 14659.14s]  Oh, I have to be standing the right way.
[14659.14s -> 14662.20s]  I got it at the beginning when we take pictures.
[14662.20s -> 14719.44s]  Um, I don't get it.
[14727.62s -> 14736.38s]  I get it.
[14736.38s -> 14739.40s]  Let's get a picture of this.
[14739.40s -> 14744.23s]  No, nevermind.
[14744.23s -> 14747.88s]  So I have to bring it, I don't know.
[14747.88s -> 14749.88s]  I can't take a picture of that.
[14749.88s -> 14753.09s]  That doesn't do anything.
[14753.09s -> 14756.47s]  What can I do?
[14756.47s -> 14784.96s]  Interesting.
[14784.96s -> 14787.65s]  Oh, hold on, it's right there.
[14787.65s -> 14805.28s]  I already got it.
[14805.28s -> 14810.36s]  Here's the, whoa, oh boy.
[14810.36s -> 14833.92s]  This is gonna take a little bit of extra peanut butter.
[14833.92s -> 14838.32s]  So not much else to do, but that's kind of cool.
[14838.32s -> 14854.73s]  So I'm just gonna play with this.
[14854.73s -> 14856.26s]  Thank you.
[14856.26s -> 14951.75s]  I'll cherish this.
[14951.75s -> 14952.59s]  Okay.
[14957.04s -> 14959.08s]  Can you think of like the most childish image to draw?
[14959.08s -> 14961.80s]  Like, I'm just thinking, okay, what would you draw
[14961.80s -> 14965.79s]  to be like really just, oh, I know.
[14965.79s -> 14969.08s]  How about like somebody with like the finger?
[14969.08s -> 14970.60s]  No, he's gonna be waving.
[14970.60s -> 15006.18s]  Ready?
[15006.18s -> 15010.33s]  No, that's fun.
[15010.33s -> 15018.07s]  It's a cat.
[15018.07s -> 15021.60s]  All right, now this is where the fun begins.
[15021.60s -> 15025.41s]  All right, we need that.
[15025.41s -> 15032.96s]  We need this to be, jeez.
[15034.18s -> 15039.16s]  Actually, this has to be first, I think, right?
[15039.16s -> 15055.84s]  So if I go like that here,
[15055.84s -> 15062.64s]  and this needs to be right here.
[15062.64s -> 15067.88s]  Is that gonna work?
[15067.88s -> 15071.79s]  Oh, yes.
[15071.79s -> 15075.39s]  Where there is truly a fickle thing,
[15075.39s -> 15081.09s]  the claimant can impound non-living thing.
[15081.09s -> 15086.68s]  Impossible questions and impossible solutions.
[15086.68s -> 15093.40s]  Optional challenge, let's go.
[15093.40s -> 15096.96s]  Only one piece of film, that's fine.
[15096.96s -> 15145.19s]  I don't need it.
[15145.19s -> 15156.91s]  I have an idea.
[15156.91s -> 15161.97s]  Just stagger it.
[15161.97s -> 15179.13s]  See what I mean?
[15179.13s -> 15183.78s]  Oh, I get a better picture.
[15183.78s -> 15185.86s]  I need a lot less of the outside.
[15185.86s -> 15207.04s]  There we go.
[15207.04s -> 15207.88s]  That's definitely what I have to do.
[15207.88s -> 15218.12s]  I just not, I gotta get it right.
[15218.12s -> 15223.88s]  Kind of better, kind of.
[15223.92s -> 15238.38s]  I don't know if I can jump to here though.
[15238.38s -> 15259.43s]  Damn it.
[15259.43s -> 15261.11s]  Can you please play a soap cutting video?
[15261.11s -> 15279.28s]  No, get out of here.
[15279.28s -> 15299.33s]  I got the right idea, it's just not the right execution.
[15299.33s -> 15301.69s]  Jumping?
[15301.69s -> 15303.56s]  That looks pretty good.
[15303.56s -> 15306.91s]  That looks kind of good.
[15306.91s -> 15309.35s]  Oh, that is close.
[15309.35s -> 15324.39s]  It's gonna be really close.
[15324.39s -> 15325.51s]  So close, but so far.
[15325.51s -> 15353.54s]  Maybe, is that it?
[15353.54s -> 15362.98s]  Oh, it's so close.
[15362.98s -> 15399.37s]  I think that might be it.
[15399.37s -> 15403.96s]  I'm trying to catch the last pixel.
[15403.96s -> 15404.80s]  Damn it.
[15404.80s -> 15416.29s]  That's the right call though.
[15416.29s -> 15423.24s]  That sounded like Arnold.
[15424.20s -> 15425.34s]  Wow.
[15425.34s -> 15433.80s]  Wow.
[15433.80s -> 15436.72s]  I'm so fucking close.
[15436.72s -> 15476.43s]  That could be the one.
[15476.43s -> 15479.84s]  Ooh, this could be it.
[15479.84s -> 15482.91s]  It could be.
[15482.91s -> 15488.72s]  Damn it.
[15488.72s -> 15517.12s]  Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[15517.12s -> 15521.65s]  There it is.
[15521.65s -> 15532.85s]  I got a new filter, rainbow filter.
[15532.85s -> 15537.43s]  Wow, that's kind of wacky.
[15537.43s -> 15539.08s]  Looks like the negative.
[15539.08s -> 15540.44s]  I'll try it.
[15540.44s -> 15554.64s]  I'll try it for once.
[15554.64s -> 15556.28s]  All optional content completed.
[15556.28s -> 15568.70s]  Let's try this one.
[15568.70s -> 15581.68s]  Spill.
[15581.68s -> 15586.60s]  There's no other photos here, right?
[15586.60s -> 15589.90s]  I think we're getting to the end of the game.
[15589.94s -> 15590.78s]  One more section.
[15590.78s -> 15599.74s]  I wonder if it's, how long it is.
[15599.74s -> 15601.80s]  It's one of these.
[15601.80s -> 15604.25s]  It's one of these where I have to go
[15604.25s -> 15607.96s]  like three different ways.
[15607.96s -> 15612.72s]  Okay, I see the teleporter.
[15612.72s -> 15631.22s]  All right, well, that's not gonna work, is it?
[15631.22s -> 15633.52s]  How many does it need?
[15633.52s -> 15646.32s]  One or I can't tell.
[15646.32s -> 15681.13s]  It might just be one.
[15681.13s -> 15681.97s]  Is it one?
[15681.97s -> 15683.25s]  I hope it's one and not two.
[15683.25s -> 15686.05s]  If it's two, then I'm in trouble.
[15686.05s -> 15692.81s]  If it's one, I got it right here.
[15692.81s -> 15694.32s]  It is one.
[15694.32s -> 15699.14s]  That was the first try.
[15699.14s -> 15706.52s]  Photocopy?
[15706.52s -> 15709.07s]  What does that look like?
[15709.07s -> 15710.60s]  Nope.
[15710.60s -> 15712.64s]  Stay on this one for now.
[15712.64s -> 15719.50s]  I feel like we didn't get a chance to see it.
[15720.50s -> 15728.44s]  This game is really good.
[15728.44s -> 15731.86s]  It's just really, the puzzles are hard,
[15731.86s -> 15736.20s]  but they're not too hard.
[15736.20s -> 15741.51s]  Did I do them all?
[15741.51s -> 15746.60s]  No, one more.
[15746.60s -> 15749.54s]  Optional.
[15749.54s -> 15753.32s]  Okay, there's one more optional.
[15753.32s -> 15759.59s]  And then there are two.
[15759.59s -> 15761.03s]  All right, there's one more regular level,
[15761.03s -> 15763.64s]  and then there's two optionals.
[15763.64s -> 15769.64s]  Let's try this one.
[15769.64s -> 15773.25s]  All right, they've introduced weight.
[15773.25s -> 15779.80s]  I don't have the camera.
[15779.80s -> 15781.72s]  All right, so I'm gonna take a picture of,
[15781.72s -> 15784.72s]  okay, I'm gonna take a picture of the watermelon.
[15784.72s -> 15800.39s]  Seems easy enough.
[15800.39s -> 15830.96s]  Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[15830.96s -> 15833.30s]  Why can't I look through this?
[15833.30s -> 15837.63s]  That's kind of weird, right?
[15837.63s -> 15845.08s]  Oh, just stand on it.
[15845.08s -> 15854.04s]  Hmm, hmm, hmm.
[15854.04s -> 15858.51s]  I did not want to go all the way back.
[15858.51s -> 15881.73s]  Hmm.
[15881.73s -> 15882.69s]  Can I just throw it?
[15900.98s -> 15901.86s]  Does this take a picture?
[15901.86s -> 15903.32s]  Wait, what is this?
[15903.32s -> 15904.64s]  I don't think this takes a picture of anything.
[15904.64s -> 15909.17s]  Yeah, because it's all, yeah.
[15909.17s -> 15919.23s]  But wait, can I get over here?
[15919.23s -> 15924.08s]  Damn it.
[15924.08s -> 15925.12s]  What do I do?
[15925.12s -> 15986.57s]  Shit.
[15986.57s -> 15999.91s]  Oh, my melon!
[15999.91s -> 16002.08s]  I don't have the camera,
[16002.08s -> 16003.44s]  so I can't take a picture of the melon.
[16004.32s -> 16008.50s]  Wait, can I stuff it in here?
[16008.50s -> 16009.34s]  What's this hole here for?
[16009.34s -> 16010.62s]  This hole is weird.
[16010.62s -> 16013.80s]  Oh, my God.
[16013.80s -> 16015.81s]  This is a weird hole.
[16015.81s -> 16017.59s]  That's a weird hole, isn't it?
[16017.59s -> 16019.92s]  It's perfectly for a melon.
[16019.92s -> 16044.20s]  That is a perfect hole for a melon.
[16044.20s -> 16082.12s]  Hmm, I wonder.
[16082.12s -> 16089.00s]  I got an idea.
[16089.00s -> 16089.84s]  Here it is.
[16089.84s -> 16094.68s]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[16094.68s -> 16111.68s]  This is gonna be wacky.
[16111.68s -> 16117.81s]  Can I stand on something?
[16117.81s -> 16118.65s]  I can't move anything over there.
[16118.65s -> 16131.72s]  I can't stand on something.
[16131.72s -> 16133.56s]  Can I activate the camera through the ball here?
[16133.56s -> 16134.40s]  Like if I jump off?
[16134.44s -> 16172.88s]  No, there's no way to hit that button.
[16172.88s -> 16191.55s]  Fuck you, game.
[16191.55s -> 16207.40s]  I cheated.
[16207.40s -> 16211.49s]  We know.
[16211.49s -> 16213.77s]  I saw somebody, okay, I was moving over
[16213.77s -> 16216.76s]  and I see somebody say, cut the watermelon.
[16216.76s -> 16217.88s]  I was like, what are they talking about?
[16217.88s -> 16219.00s]  And then I realized I took the picture
[16219.00s -> 16221.48s]  and I was like, that's how you cut the watermelon.
[16221.48s -> 16223.20s]  So I half cheated.
[16223.20s -> 16228.92s]  I didn't know how to do it until it was too late.
[16228.92s -> 16231.32s]  So I half cheated.
[16231.32s -> 16233.81s]  That's not even enough.
[16233.81s -> 16234.65s]  Yeah, I got it.
[16234.65s -> 16252.50s]  Okay, I get it, I get it.
[16252.50s -> 16253.50s]  Interesting.
[16253.50s -> 16261.95s]  That's funny.
[16261.95s -> 16279.51s]  Please repent.
[16279.51s -> 16305.25s]  You need to eat a watermelon on stream to repent.
[16305.25s -> 16311.48s]  Hey, new camera filter, watermelon filter?
[16311.48s -> 16314.04s]  What does that look like?
[16314.04s -> 16325.10s]  I have to know.
[16325.10s -> 16337.90s]  Yeah, all right, it's expensive,
[16337.90s -> 16341.80s]  but let me tell you something.
[16341.80s -> 16344.96s]  The best juice, the best fruit juice
[16344.96s -> 16350.38s]  you can possibly purchase, and I mean it.
[16350.38s -> 16355.37s]  Have you guys ever had evolution juice?
[16355.37s -> 16357.89s]  Evolution watermelon juice or evolution orange juice
[16357.89s -> 16361.12s]  is nothing compares.
[16361.12s -> 16365.83s]  Absolutely nothing compares.
[16365.83s -> 16368.98s]  Absolutely nothing can ever compare.
[16368.98s -> 16370.34s]  A whole lot of no's.
[16370.34s -> 16373.68s]  Really?
[16373.68s -> 16374.52s]  Never heard of it.
[16374.52s -> 16382.09s]  Has anybody heard of it?
[16382.09s -> 16383.33s]  You know where you sometimes will see it?
[16383.33s -> 16385.21s]  You'll see it in Starbucks.
[16385.21s -> 16392.00s]  Starbucks sometimes has them on the rack.
[16392.00s -> 16401.09s]  Does anybody know what I'm talking about?
[16401.09s -> 16402.57s]  Does nobody know this?
[16402.57s -> 16412.35s]  How does nobody know this?
[16412.35s -> 16413.55s]  I've seen this across the country.
[16413.55s -> 16420.65s]  It's not just in Vegas.
[16420.65s -> 16421.69s]  Nice hallucination.
[16421.69s -> 16429.40s]  No, I'm telling you, it's life changing.
[16429.40s -> 16435.22s]  Now, evolution, evolution juice brand.
[16435.22s -> 16438.82s]  It's expensive.
[16438.82s -> 16441.54s]  It's a cold pressed juice.
[16441.54s -> 16447.23s]  Their orange juice, it goes absolutely nuts.
[16447.23s -> 16450.84s]  It's the kind, okay, so when you see it on the shelf,
[16450.84s -> 16453.88s]  it's half of it, like all the orange
[16453.88s -> 16460.34s]  is settled to the bottom half.
[16460.34s -> 16462.98s]  And then all the top is like a clear liquid
[16462.98s -> 16464.42s]  and you have to really shake it up.
[16464.42s -> 16471.84s]  This shit is fucking unbelievable.
[16471.84s -> 16474.08s]  I don't buy it that often, but when I do,
[16475.16s -> 16479.16s]  and they have a watermelon, oh man.
[16479.16s -> 16480.24s]  It's no, it's not pulp.
[16480.24s -> 16481.08s]  It's not pulp.
[16485.65s -> 16488.84s]  But no, it is kind of pulpy because it's,
[16488.84s -> 16490.12s]  you know, it's the real shit.
[16490.12s -> 16493.35s]  No one's had this.
[16494.85s -> 16499.57s]  There's such an unbelievable orange aftertaste
[16499.57s -> 16504.14s]  that tastes like a real orange.
[16504.14s -> 16505.34s]  They sell this shit in Starbucks.
[16505.34s -> 16515.20s]  It's not shit, it's delicious.
[16515.20s -> 16519.68s]  How much, okay, how much is a large,
[16519.68s -> 16522.64s]  like 32 or like 20, like a big jug of orange juice?
[16522.64s -> 16527.76s]  Like how much is it now?
[16527.76s -> 16534.78s]  Six bucks, seven bucks?
[16534.78s -> 16540.59s]  So this one is like nine to $10 per jug.
[16540.59s -> 16544.16s]  Six or seven, yeah, that's usually what it is.
[16544.16s -> 16548.10s]  But let me tell you, if you have an opportunity to try it,
[16548.10s -> 16550.10s]  it's gonna ruin everything for you.
[16550.10s -> 16551.18s]  It's gonna ruin everything for you.
[16551.18s -> 16560.04s]  It's gonna ruin everything.
[16560.04s -> 16561.04s]  How big of a jug?
[16563.70s -> 16566.16s]  I think it's 32.
[16566.16s -> 16567.00s]  I think it's 32 ounces.
[16567.00s -> 16585.75s]  It might be more than that.
[16585.75s -> 16588.31s]  $11 for, actually, I think that is accurate.
[16588.31s -> 16589.19s]  Let me, hold on a second.
[16589.19s -> 16590.47s]  Give me one sec, I wanna look.
[16590.47s -> 16591.75s]  Actually, I own one right now.
[16591.75s -> 16594.12s]  I saw it and I was like, holy shit, I need this.
[16594.12s -> 16596.23s]  Give me one second.
[16596.23s -> 16652.46s]  I'll give you the exact ounce, the exact ounceage.
[16652.46s -> 16654.02s]  God, I just slammed a bunch of it too.
[16654.02s -> 16655.30s]  I just ripped it out of the fridge
[16655.30s -> 16657.52s]  and just started chugging it.
[16658.28s -> 16662.47s]  It's 59 ounces and I believe it was $11.
[16662.47s -> 16671.65s]  So it's about 60 ounces.
[16671.65s -> 16676.97s]  So that's about, you know, 60 ounces, yeah, 59 ounces.
[16676.97s -> 16686.61s]  No, I didn't drink 60 ounces.
[16686.61s -> 16688.33s]  So it's 59 ounces.
[16688.33s -> 16690.09s]  It was about 10, 11 bucks.
[16690.09s -> 16691.01s]  Maybe you can get it cheaper.
[16691.01s -> 16697.83s]  Maybe it's more expensive somewhere else.
[16697.83s -> 16702.93s]  The orange juice and the watermelon juice.
[16702.93s -> 16705.76s]  I think they make like, oh, there's vitamins in this one.
[16705.76s -> 16707.00s]  I don't get any of that.
[16707.00s -> 16717.98s]  I just get the straight up juice.
[16717.98s -> 16721.84s]  But I don't see it that often.
[16721.84s -> 16724.40s]  When I do see it, like my eyes just lasers
[16724.40s -> 16725.24s]  just shoot out at it.
[16725.24s -> 16742.91s]  Like, it's the one with the cursive logo, yes.
[16742.91s -> 16747.87s]  But this is the kind of juice that you sip this.
[16747.87s -> 16752.00s]  I cannot work with that.
[16752.00s -> 16755.28s]  You sip this like it's a fine wine.
[16755.28s -> 16765.75s]  I just, I just told you I slammed it.
[16775.56s -> 16784.50s]  Yeah, it's all right.
[16784.50s -> 16791.64s]  Okay, I need, where's the, where is it?
[16802.90s -> 16804.62s]  It's really good.
[16804.66s -> 16807.22s]  You know, if there's one thing that you can tell,
[16807.22s -> 16809.82s]  okay, if there's one thing that you know about me
[16809.82s -> 16812.06s]  and this stream and everything about this,
[16812.06s -> 16813.98s]  I don't mess around when it comes to food brands
[16813.98s -> 16815.73s]  that I like.
[16815.73s -> 16818.77s]  Have I steered you wrong before?
[16818.77s -> 16820.73s]  Have I steered you wrong before?
[16820.73s -> 16825.73s]  I do not mess around when it comes to foods and beverages.
[16826.49s -> 16838.75s]  I don't screw around.
[16838.75s -> 16842.63s]  I recommend only the finest products,
[16842.63s -> 16845.55s]  only the most delicious beverages, only the best.
[16845.95s -> 16849.59s]  Dr. Oetker's sucks.
[16849.59s -> 16850.47s]  That is one of the most,
[16850.47s -> 16852.59s]  that is one of the finest frozen pizzas.
[16852.59s -> 16854.39s]  I don't even know if they make it anymore.
[16854.39s -> 16860.27s]  But no, no, no, it does not.
[16860.27s -> 16862.71s]  I've never steered you wrong.
[16862.71s -> 16864.91s]  I believe everything I've said
[16864.91s -> 16869.40s]  about different beverages and foods.
[16869.40s -> 16871.61s]  Fuck the cheesy gordita crunch.
[16871.61s -> 16881.97s]  That actually might constitute a ban in this channel.
[16881.97s -> 16883.41s]  Do you think that that's, I mean,
[16883.41s -> 16897.04s]  that really might constitute a real, like, permanent ban.
[16897.04s -> 16903.25s]  How do I, what am I doing here?
[16903.25s -> 16905.84s]  What about McDonald's?
[16905.84s -> 16910.53s]  Yeah, I love my McDonald's order.
[16910.53s -> 16917.47s]  It's two double cheeseburgers, no pickle,
[16917.47s -> 16921.38s]  one McChicken, not spicy McChicken,
[16921.38s -> 16923.94s]  but sometimes you can't find that anymore,
[16923.94s -> 16928.81s]  and then a 10-piece nugget, meal, so you get the drink,
[16928.81s -> 16932.61s]  and then those nuggets are to be shared with the group.
[16932.61s -> 16935.65s]  Not, that's not the old, like, two or three years ago
[16935.65s -> 16938.50s]  when me and Ludwig were talking about it.
[16938.50s -> 16941.70s]  No, that, two double cheeseburgers, one McChicken,
[16941.70s -> 16944.66s]  and then nuggets for the table.
[16944.66s -> 16946.02s]  Sometimes I don't even eat those nuggets.
[16946.02s -> 16951.67s]  It's just like, hey, they're here.
[16951.67s -> 16953.67s]  No pickles, no, I don't like pickles on.
[16959.88s -> 16967.52s]  Three burgers, holy shit.
[16967.52s -> 16973.75s]  They're not, a McChicken is pretty small.
[16973.75s -> 16975.56s]  No fries?
[16975.56s -> 16982.78s]  No, you, the fries come with the McNuggets.
[16982.78s -> 16985.18s]  And I might, I don't really eat the nuggets.
[16985.18s -> 16987.10s]  It's just like, I get them because,
[16987.10s -> 16988.62s]  here's the thing about nuggets.
[16988.62s -> 16992.47s]  A lot of times, people don't want to order them.
[16992.47s -> 16995.35s]  Like, oh, yeah, I could get nuggets, but mm.
[16995.35s -> 16999.33s]  It's like, don't worry, I got you, I got you covered.
[16999.33s -> 17000.17s]  I'm gonna get them,
[17000.17s -> 17002.80s]  and we can all just share out of the box, fine.
[17002.80s -> 17004.85s]  I got you, I got you.
[17004.85s -> 17006.35s]  They always get eaten.
[17006.35s -> 17015.76s]  They're always eaten, all of them.
[17015.76s -> 17017.72s]  I don't eat all of it.
[17017.72s -> 17018.96s]  There's been a misconception
[17018.96s -> 17022.80s]  that I eat every single thing in that order.
[17022.80s -> 17024.80s]  And here's, listen to me.
[17024.80s -> 17031.27s]  If there is no group, if there is no group,
[17031.27s -> 17035.19s]  a McChicken is deleted, a Double Cheeseburger is deleted,
[17035.19s -> 17037.97s]  and it's a 10-piece nugget meal
[17037.97s -> 17051.22s]  and a Double Cheeseburger for the Powerade, that's it.
[17051.22s -> 17059.08s]  Why did I just take a picture of this?
[17059.08s -> 17070.91s]  All right, where am I, where am I going?
[17070.91s -> 17073.19s]  It's over there.
[17073.19s -> 17074.55s]  I need to, I need to look,
[17074.55s -> 17091.67s]  see what the hell's going on here.
[17091.67s -> 17101.53s]  Get me, okay.
[17101.53s -> 17114.71s]  I need to dispense this, like, pissing me off so bad.
[17126.66s -> 17137.44s]  There we go.
[17137.44s -> 17138.64s]  Okay, so what did we learn?
[17138.64s -> 17139.48s]  We learned a few things.
[17139.48s -> 17149.65s]  We learned Evolution Juice is probably the best.
[17149.65s -> 17156.29s]  It's three, damn, okay, hold on.
[17156.29s -> 17180.66s]  Three.
[17180.66s -> 17184.45s]  Your order comes out to be about 2,000 calories.
[17184.45s -> 17185.69s]  How much is a Double Cheeseburger
[17185.69s -> 17187.57s]  for McDonald's with no pickle?
[17187.57s -> 17197.23s]  Just one Double Cheeseburger, what is it?
[17197.23s -> 17201.08s]  Just a Double Cheeseburger, it's 400.
[17201.08s -> 17212.36s]  That's four, eight, and then how much is a McChicken?
[17212.36s -> 17218.04s]  Standard McChicken, nothing on it.
[17218.04s -> 17221.52s]  350?
[17221.52s -> 17226.72s]  It's 1,100 calories.
[17226.72s -> 17241.33s]  This level's too hard.
[17241.33s -> 17242.65s]  What size drink?
[17242.65s -> 17248.22s]  I usually don't do, I don't really get,
[17248.22s -> 17249.87s]  here's what I'll do.
[17249.87s -> 17253.71s]  I'll get a Powerade and I'll just put it in the fridge.
[17253.71s -> 17255.19s]  I'll maybe take, like, a few sips out of it,
[17255.19s -> 17261.49s]  but I usually save most of it.
[17261.49s -> 17265.16s]  Hey, another voicemail.
[17265.16s -> 17268.40s]  It's getting harder and harder to reach you.
[17268.40s -> 17269.32s]  I hope you're doing well.
[17269.32s -> 17272.00s]  I am kind of a weird person,
[17272.00s -> 17274.48s]  and I know a lot of people are like this too,
[17274.48s -> 17277.12s]  so raise your hand if you're like this as well.
[17277.12s -> 17278.48s]  When I'm hungry and I eat,
[17281.28s -> 17285.31s]  I don't really drink a full drink.
[17285.31s -> 17291.11s]  I just kind of, I think a drink kind of fills you up a lot.
[17291.11s -> 17292.63s]  Sometimes I won't even take a sip of something
[17292.63s -> 17294.70s]  for a little while.
[17294.70s -> 17297.93s]  I used to be like that, yeah.
[17297.93s -> 17302.77s]  I think a lot more people do that than I think.
[17302.77s -> 17305.69s]  But obviously, like, I'm not just gonna wolf down food
[17305.69s -> 17308.13s]  without a drink, that's not good.
[17308.13s -> 17316.44s]  I'll take a sip or two maybe every so often.
[17316.48s -> 17319.36s]  A lot of people do that, yeah.
[17319.36s -> 17322.32s]  I think that's why I'm able to eat a little bit more food,
[17322.32s -> 17330.04s]  is because I'm not filling up with a big 32-ounce drink.
[17330.04s -> 17332.44s]  The drink is the first thing I finish.
[17332.44s -> 17339.12s]  See, that's super foreign to me.
[17339.12s -> 17340.76s]  And let me make this very clear.
[17342.69s -> 17347.57s]  This is a once-in-a-while delicacy.
[17347.57s -> 17350.69s]  I am not eating 1,100 calories,
[17350.69s -> 17355.44s]  1,200 calories of McDonald's every day.
[17356.24s -> 17359.92s]  This is like once in a while.
[17359.92s -> 17360.96s]  And hey, guess what?
[17360.96s -> 17363.04s]  I have some really bad news for you.
[17363.04s -> 17365.00s]  That large milkshake that you got
[17365.00s -> 17366.56s]  from the fucking ice cream store
[17366.56s -> 17371.16s]  is probably 1,400 calories.
[17371.16s -> 17379.63s]  So, hey, don't come charging at me.
[17379.63s -> 17380.55s]  This is weird.
[17380.55s -> 17384.93s]  All right, so I need one.
[17384.93s -> 17389.12s]  Okay, let's try to get this done.
[17389.12s -> 17390.72s]  Weird, okay.
[17390.72s -> 17391.88s]  Oh, goodness.
[17395.16s -> 17403.64s]  All right, so this one is, this one has color.
[17403.88s -> 17406.20s]  It's time for the ultimate poll.
[17406.20s -> 17407.48s]  The ultimate food poll.
[17407.48s -> 17408.68s]  You guys ready?
[17408.68s -> 17411.28s]  Let's do it.
[17411.28s -> 17416.28s]  How many scoops of ice cream would you consider to be?
[17416.44s -> 17417.28s]  That's good.
[17417.28s -> 17421.12s]  From, not from the freezer
[17421.12s -> 17422.64s]  where you're doing it on your own.
[17422.64s -> 17426.38s]  I'm talking about you're at an ice cream store.
[17426.38s -> 17427.38s]  And it's like, okay, here you go.
[17427.38s -> 17428.90s]  Here are the sizes.
[17428.90s -> 17430.74s]  It's one, two, three.
[17430.74s -> 17432.50s]  One, two, or three.
[17432.50s -> 17433.34s]  Which one is it?
[17433.34s -> 17434.18s]  I'm gonna give you the correct answer
[17434.18s -> 17460.09s]  when we're done doing the poll.
[17460.09s -> 17461.21s]  The correct answer.
[17465.27s -> 17466.95s]  Somebody said one.
[17466.95s -> 17477.38s]  I'm ashamed to say more than three in public.
[17477.38s -> 17485.01s]  Look at this.
[17485.01s -> 17494.12s]  That was not as hard as I thought it was gonna be.
[17494.12s -> 17496.20s]  Decentrist Andy, we already know this.
[17496.20s -> 17499.17s]  Well, that might not be correct.
[17499.17s -> 17502.84s]  Let's see.
[17502.84s -> 17506.97s]  Okay, very interesting.
[17506.97s -> 17509.64s]  The correct answer is one.
[17509.64s -> 17510.60s]  Correct answer is one.
[17510.60s -> 17515.74s]  I'm gonna give you the reason why.
[17515.74s -> 17520.72s]  I've gone to get an ice cream before.
[17520.72s -> 17523.52s]  And you go, you know, usually it's usually
[17523.52s -> 17526.62s]  at the, in the evening times.
[17526.62s -> 17529.82s]  And one scoop of ice cream from a place,
[17529.82s -> 17533.30s]  from a store is usually massive.
[17533.30s -> 17534.66s]  Massive.
[17534.66s -> 17538.03s]  To a point where I'll eat half of it.
[17538.03s -> 17539.83s]  I'll eat two thirds of it and be like,
[17539.83s -> 17544.93s]  oh, geez, I just can't do it anymore.
[17544.93s -> 17545.77s]  It really depends.
[17545.77s -> 17546.61s]  Yeah, somebody, that's a good point.
[17546.61s -> 17548.69s]  It really depends on where.
[17548.69s -> 17553.76s]  But most places really, really pile it on.
[17553.76s -> 17556.44s]  And I've even been to places where I go, yeah, yeah.
[17556.44s -> 17557.96s]  Can I, can I get one?
[17557.96s -> 17560.45s]  Just like the little, just small one.
[17560.45s -> 17565.45s]  And the worker is super nice and really, really wonderful.
[17565.97s -> 17568.17s]  And they're like, I got you, I got you, yep.
[17568.17s -> 17570.81s]  And they really just, they kind of give a little extra.
[17570.81s -> 17573.97s]  And it's just like, okay, all right, all right.
[17573.97s -> 17574.81s]  We're good, we're good.
[17574.81s -> 17577.80s]  Okay, that's all right.
[17577.80s -> 17583.83s]  It's like super nice.
[17583.83s -> 17590.28s]  I would like to order the little kid's,
[17592.52s -> 17596.04s]  I want like the smallest possible one.
[17596.04s -> 17598.24s]  Because after a while,
[17598.24s -> 17601.55s]  please raise your hand if you like this.
[17601.55s -> 17607.20s]  After like bite number 10 of an ice cream,
[17607.20s -> 17609.52s]  it sort of starts to get a little,
[17609.52s -> 17610.80s]  the flavor kind of goes away
[17610.80s -> 17614.26s]  and it kind of just becomes like milk to me.
[17614.26s -> 17617.36s]  It gets a little kind of heavy and,
[17617.36s -> 17621.38s]  not, yeah, bite, like you're eating a,
[17621.54s -> 17625.38s]  there was a communication breakdown.
[17625.38s -> 17628.66s]  There was a communication breakdown tonight.
[17628.66s -> 17637.16s]  There was a, oh shit, this is so funny.
[17646.25s -> 17652.24s]  I should have, I should have started like this.
[17652.24s -> 17654.60s]  I'm talking about in a cup, not,
[17654.60s -> 17656.84s]  I shouldn't, I'm not talking about an ice cream cone.
[17656.84s -> 17665.06s]  I'm talking about in a like cup with a spoon.
[17665.06s -> 17669.40s]  I probably should have made that a little clearer.
[17669.40s -> 17671.82s]  I just keep imagining just,
[17671.82s -> 17674.66s]  just taking big bites out of an ice cream.
[17674.66s -> 17677.84s]  You'd be like, holy shit, dude.
[17677.84s -> 17680.48s]  That's like, that's what like a dog would do.
[17680.48s -> 17682.56s]  Like stop, slow down.
[17691.11s -> 17694.94s]  Okay, so now that we have that clear,
[17694.94s -> 17699.85s]  when you get more than two scoops of ice cream in a cup,
[17699.85s -> 17704.84s]  it's, it just gets so heavy after a while.
[17704.84s -> 17706.24s]  I'm glad we could clear that up though.
[17706.24s -> 17708.30s]  Thanks for joining.
[17708.30s -> 17710.22s]  Magnificent athletic feet.
[17710.22s -> 17714.22s]  And with that's grace at that.
[17714.22s -> 17715.74s]  I just keep seeing somebody just be like,
[17715.74s -> 17716.82s]  oh, thanks, I appreciate it.
[17716.82s -> 17719.26s]  Like bite, bite, bite, bite.
[17721.06s -> 17721.94s]  I feel like I was going to be,
[17721.94s -> 17723.94s]  I feel like I was on like a prank video.
[17723.94s -> 17738.52s]  Like, what is this guy doing?
[17738.52s -> 17743.30s]  Okay, now here.
[17743.30s -> 17745.26s]  Yeah, there was a little communication breakdown there,
[17745.26s -> 17751.20s]  but that, that was, oh, that was funny.
[17751.20s -> 17754.16s]  That was so funny.
[17754.16s -> 17757.45s]  Oh man.
[17757.45s -> 17772.48s]  Back here.
[17772.48s -> 17776.69s]  You've done whatever's in this maze of memories
[17777.41s -> 17778.25s]  and forgotten wonder.
[17778.25s -> 17779.09s]  Did I win?
[17779.09s -> 17782.13s]  I hope your experience has been pleasant so far.
[17782.13s -> 17785.68s]  To me, it's been.
[17785.68s -> 17788.40s]  This is going to be awful.
[17788.40s -> 17794.17s]  Okay, so it's blue, blue.
[17794.17s -> 17795.37s]  What about the McRiddle?
[17795.37s -> 17799.32s]  See, the McRiddle is kind of where I draw the line
[17799.32s -> 17803.01s]  because I don't, it's not that I don't like the McRiddle,
[17803.01s -> 17805.69s]  but it's kind of too much for me.
[17819.02s -> 17820.66s]  All right, I need a minute to pay attention to this.
[17820.66s -> 17826.79s]  What's the point of me doing this by the way?
[17826.79s -> 17833.88s]  Yeah, why wouldn't I just,
[17833.88s -> 17844.91s]  it tastes really good.
[17844.91s -> 17848.35s]  I need to, give me a second.
[17848.35s -> 17850.63s]  Ooh, this just hurts.
[17850.63s -> 17851.47s]  This hurts.
[17851.47s -> 17854.71s]  Okay, I think I'm just going to skip the blue.
[17866.18s -> 17870.71s]  I don't have a camera or anything.
[17870.71s -> 17871.67s]  I mean, it's open right now.
[17871.67s -> 17884.24s]  Can I just, wait, yeah.
[17884.24s -> 17885.44s]  Is it changing?
[17885.44s -> 17895.76s]  It looks like it's changing.
[17895.76s -> 17906.88s]  Damn it.
[17913.66s -> 17914.90s]  This one is confusing me.
[17914.90s -> 17934.49s]  Well, am I missing something to do here?
[17934.49s -> 17936.45s]  I keep thinking of somebody just biting an ice cream,
[17936.45s -> 17938.69s]  like hard.
[17939.37s -> 17940.41s]  I feel like that would be so bad on your teeth.
[17940.41s -> 17943.31s]  I feel like my teeth would just, ugh.
[17945.84s -> 17952.05s]  It is a mobile game ad.
[17952.05s -> 17952.89s]  So what?
[17952.89s -> 17954.81s]  I guess, okay.
[17954.81s -> 17957.53s]  I think I understand.
[17957.53s -> 17960.65s]  If I go through blue, walk through blue, step on that,
[17960.65s -> 17967.99s]  go through, I don't, I don't, I don't get it.
[17967.99s -> 17973.65s]  Let's go through red.
[17973.65s -> 17975.57s]  They line up.
[17975.57s -> 17978.01s]  Yeah, but I mean,
[17978.01s -> 17980.57s]  why would I walk all the way over here to turn it red
[17980.57s -> 17984.68s]  to walk all the way that way?
[17984.68s -> 17987.92s]  What is this one even doing?
[17988.28s -> 17989.20s]  This one's not even taking down something.
[17989.20s -> 17990.04s]  What is it?
[17990.04s -> 17990.88s]  What is this doing?
[17990.88s -> 17997.59s]  Is it doing something?
[17997.59s -> 18020.08s]  What's the point of this one?
[18020.08s -> 18035.88s]  I'm going to just try this way and see what happens here.
[18035.88s -> 18037.28s]  You're changing the portals.
[18037.28s -> 18042.65s]  Red has always been over here.
[18042.65s -> 18045.23s]  Now that's blue.
[18045.23s -> 18048.43s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18048.43s -> 18050.79s]  Ah, okay, okay, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[18050.79s -> 18053.64s]  All right, sorry, I was talking about ice cream and shit.
[18053.64s -> 18055.04s]  All right, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[18055.04s -> 18056.00s]  All right, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[18056.00s -> 18058.60s]  I know exactly what, yeah, I got it, it's done.
[18058.60s -> 18061.68s]  I wasn't, yeah, I think,
[18061.68s -> 18063.04s]  I don't think anybody knew that was going on
[18063.08s -> 18074.14s]  except for one person.
[18074.14s -> 18075.10s]  What's this, what type of ice cream?
[18075.10s -> 18080.27s]  What's the, what's this for?
[18080.27s -> 18083.63s]  Soft serve, oh yeah, this is an easy one for me.
[18083.63s -> 18086.63s]  Isn't making it this far enough?
[18086.63s -> 18088.83s]  Haven't you gained all the knowledge
[18088.83s -> 18090.75s]  this place has to offer?
[18090.75s -> 18092.63s]  This was our life's work,
[18092.63s -> 18103.84s]  and it's meaningful the way you want these.
[18103.84s -> 18105.60s]  This is the big reveal.
[18105.60s -> 18117.42s]  That, wait, aren't I still in the simulation?
[18117.42s -> 18119.66s]  Scoop, I believe, is the correct answer.
[18119.66s -> 18124.20s]  Scoop is correct with one,
[18124.20s -> 18127.62s]  one thing that takes that completely out of the way.
[18127.62s -> 18134.56s]  Soft serve with a cherry dip is unbeatable no matter what.
[18136.71s -> 18141.17s]  Cherry dip, vanilla cherry dip is,
[18141.17s -> 18150.22s]  with a soft serve, nothing will ever compare, ever.
[18150.22s -> 18154.36s]  They do, like chocolate dip too is good as well.
[18154.36s -> 18157.08s]  I think cherry dip soft serve is just S plus,
[18157.08s -> 18162.44s]  and even the best S hard ice cream is below cherry dip.
[18165.33s -> 18167.32s]  You never had a cherry dip before?
[18167.32s -> 18170.50s]  Uh, Dairy Queen used to do it.
[18170.50s -> 18173.13s]  Is Dairy Queen still doing?
[18173.13s -> 18175.72s]  That's where you can get it.
[18175.72s -> 18176.56s]  It didn't work.
[18176.56s -> 18177.65s]  It's really good.
[18177.65s -> 18182.89s]  It never, it wasn't supposed to happen like this.
[18182.89s -> 18184.81s]  I feel like we need to pay attention right now.
[18184.81s -> 18198.68s]  They were all supposed to find the answer.
[18198.68s -> 18204.50s]  Hmm?
[18204.50s -> 18206.94s]  This, this isn't it, it can't be.
[18206.94s -> 18209.22s]  The solution, it all made sense.
[18209.22s -> 18211.14s]  The formula, the structure,
[18211.14s -> 18213.54s]  this should have solved all our problems.
[18213.54s -> 18215.02s]  This should have been the answer.
[18215.02s -> 18217.22s]  I need this to be the answer.
[18217.22s -> 18218.06s]  Why?
[18218.06s -> 18219.74s]  Why isn't this working?
[18219.74s -> 18235.20s]  I, I can't give up.
[18235.20s -> 18237.15s]  I'm sorry.
[18237.15s -> 18238.95s]  When I realized what you were looking for,
[18238.95s -> 18242.43s]  I didn't have the heart to tell you.
[18242.43s -> 18247.16s]  An impossible solution for an impossible question.
[18247.16s -> 18250.20s]  Mirren was, she was crushed.
[18250.20s -> 18251.52s]  They all were.
[18251.52s -> 18256.24s]  I didn't want you to have to, to feel as they felt.
[18256.24s -> 18259.00s]  It's a painful burden, knowing.
[18260.16s -> 18261.12s]  Twist is good too.
[18261.12s -> 18262.08s]  Soft serve twist.
[18265.22s -> 18268.15s]  Honestly, I'm not sure I could really pick,
[18268.15s -> 18274.09s]  you know, hard scoop ice cream is better than soft serve.
[18274.09s -> 18276.13s]  That's like a ketchup versus mustard fight.
[18276.13s -> 18287.47s]  I don't think I'm going to crown a winner there.
[18287.47s -> 18289.81s]  He does not care.
[18289.81s -> 18291.94s]  What, what, what happened?
[18291.94s -> 18295.38s]  Did something really like bad happen?
[18295.38s -> 18296.90s]  Oh, what did I, what did I happen?
[18296.90s -> 18307.06s]  What did I do?
[18307.06s -> 18308.66s]  Oh, I don't know what happened,
[18308.66s -> 18319.19s]  but I'm sorry.
[18319.19s -> 18323.67s]  I didn't, I didn't mean, I'm keeping it on watermelon.
[18323.67s -> 18333.22s]  No, I wanted to be, that's the last part of the game.
[18333.22s -> 18342.43s]  This is it, the final chapter.
[18342.43s -> 18344.59s]  Mustard is disgusting and you should feel disgusting
[18344.59s -> 18347.32s]  for liking it.
[18347.32s -> 18349.96s]  Oh, should we tell him about honey mustard
[18349.96s -> 18357.20s]  and how that, it's just sad that that opinion is,
[18357.20s -> 18362.59s]  that's, if honey mustard is existing,
[18362.59s -> 18368.64s]  just makes it hard for me to agree with that.
[18368.68s -> 18371.08s]  A good stone ground mustard with honey mustard.
[18371.08s -> 18374.00s]  Oh, ketchup is good too.
[18374.00s -> 18375.72s]  I don't love ketchup on a lot of things,
[18375.72s -> 18385.40s]  but the things I do like it on, I love it.
[18385.40s -> 18386.24s]  But it's home.
[18386.24s -> 18389.96s]  Honestly, mustard is way more versatile than ketchup.
[18389.96s -> 18391.84s]  Ketchup is just kind of ketchup and it's just ketchup.
[18391.84s -> 18393.28s]  You know what you're getting and it's very classic
[18393.28s -> 18394.36s]  and it's good.
[18394.36s -> 18398.55s]  But there are dozens of varieties of mustard.
[18398.55s -> 18401.91s]  You can turn it into completely different things.
[18401.91s -> 18404.99s]  Now you can put like, you know, a hot sauce in ketchup
[18404.99s -> 18407.31s]  and you can change ketchup a little,
[18407.31s -> 18412.27s]  but I think it's, mustard has changed almost completely
[18412.27s -> 18417.14s]  when you add things to it.
[18417.14s -> 18422.46s]  All right, let's go for it.
[18422.46s -> 18423.42s]  What do we got?
[18423.42s -> 18438.36s]  Final chapter.
[18438.36s -> 18444.75s]  Everything's kind of floating around.
[18444.75s -> 18451.89s]  I have a feeling I'm gonna have to touch some stuff,
[18451.89s -> 18454.92s]  but pastrami sandwich with mustard on it,
[18454.92s -> 18459.79s]  slice of cheese, the mustard makes the whole thing.
[18469.35s -> 18473.19s]  Camera over here.
[18473.19s -> 18474.51s]  All right, are you just hungry?
[18474.51s -> 18477.43s]  I think I'm just hungry every time I stream
[18477.43s -> 18478.67s]  because I don't eat on stream.
[18478.67s -> 18482.10s]  I think I've figured out the formula, guys.
[18482.78s -> 18485.06s]  I don't eat on stream and sometimes I'm live, you know,
[18485.06s -> 18486.82s]  for four or five, six straight hours
[18486.82s -> 18488.34s]  and I just, I'm not eating on stream.
[18488.34s -> 18490.50s]  So I just, I'm thinking about the delicious foods
[18490.50s -> 18500.76s]  that I would like to have.
[18500.76s -> 18515.27s]  Okay, so I don't have a camera.
[18515.27s -> 18517.51s]  Can I take, all right, I think I can take this.
[18517.51s -> 18518.51s]  All right, I got it.
[18527.51s -> 18540.62s]  This will delete the fence, right?
[18540.62s -> 18559.80s]  Wait, this is taking a delayed photo.
[18559.80s -> 18562.55s]  Should I do anything about this?
[18562.55s -> 18570.38s]  There's a lot of photos in this thing.
[18570.38s -> 18588.56s]  Are we gonna get to see what it looked like?
[18589.12s -> 18590.00s]  So I'm imagining I can then,
[18590.00s -> 18592.94s]  can I teleport myself in here?
[18592.94s -> 18605.71s]  Now that's cool.
[18605.71s -> 18606.71s]  Where's this phone?
[18617.68s -> 18618.52s]  Can you hear me?
[18627.08s -> 18629.76s]  Ham and cheese, mustard in the toaster oven.
[18631.20s -> 18632.04s]  Oh yeah.
[18642.16s -> 18653.11s]  I think it was the, oh yeah, that just fucked me up.
[18653.11s -> 18654.95s]  All right, I won't talk about food anymore.
[18654.95s -> 18655.79s]  Let's go.
[18657.72s -> 18659.40s]  Oh, oh yeah.
[18659.40s -> 18660.24s]  Oh yeah.
[18670.00s -> 18670.84s]  Barcode.
[18678.49s -> 18694.36s]  Reserve it?
[18694.36s -> 18697.93s]  I'm not there.
[18697.93s -> 18705.74s]  Holy shit, that's, okay, that's cool.
[18705.74s -> 18711.78s]  Barcode forest.
[18711.78s -> 18714.10s]  Anything here I can grab or no?
[18714.10s -> 18725.34s]  I think it's just a cool thing to do.
[18725.34s -> 18749.15s]  Hmm, I'll just take a picture of this.
[18749.15s -> 18755.75s]  Now I have to teleport in here, so how do I get,
[18755.75s -> 18758.44s]  maybe I do just have to stand in the forest.
[18758.44s -> 18780.08s]  Will it see me in there?
[18780.08s -> 18793.00s]  Oh shit, I deleted it accidentally.
[18793.00s -> 18803.18s]  Why would I go in the, why would I do that?
[18804.98s -> 18810.09s]  How do I get out of here?
[18810.09s -> 18838.93s]  Forest, I can do it twice.
[18838.93s -> 18848.79s]  It's a lot easier than I was making it.
[18848.79s -> 18853.44s]  Okay, picture, let's take a,
[18853.44s -> 18876.15s]  I'm just gonna take six selfies.
[18876.19s -> 18884.76s]  I think that's, I don't need more than that.
[18884.76s -> 18886.80s]  Wait a minute.
[18886.80s -> 18900.53s]  How do I, how do I get out of here with the battery?
[18900.53s -> 18914.38s]  Hmm, okay.
[18914.38s -> 18928.94s]  So now, can I get out of here like this?
[18928.94s -> 18930.14s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[18930.14s -> 18950.17s]  Okay, got it.
[18950.17s -> 18953.91s]  Now, how do I get?
[18953.91s -> 18974.15s]  I know, and I don't have enough photos.
[18974.15s -> 18975.91s]  What if I'm holding the battery in my hands
[18975.91s -> 18977.47s]  during the picture?
[18977.47s -> 18989.68s]  I'm doing that.
[18989.68s -> 19005.86s]  Let's go take a look.
[19005.86s -> 19008.38s]  All right, I need to get over there.
[19008.42s -> 19012.36s]  There is no battery.
[19012.36s -> 19016.08s]  I have to eventually teleport over there.
[19016.08s -> 19018.88s]  And down here, it looks like bullshit.
[19021.04s -> 19026.18s]  It's a text.
[19026.18s -> 19031.81s]  Elevate the pollutant degradation system.
[19031.81s -> 19033.25s]  Geniuses.
[19033.25s -> 19035.45s]  Is as though our success are the result of a team effort.
[19035.45s -> 19038.66s]  Future is looking bright and I'm having a lot of fun.
[19038.66s -> 19042.30s]  Metabolic flux analysis of bio-coded specimen
[19042.30s -> 19045.49s]  makes for fascinating research.
[19045.49s -> 19061.04s]  All right, pick any of this up.
[19061.04s -> 19062.76s]  Okay, the camera is right here.
[19062.76s -> 19064.28s]  I don't have to jump.
[19065.04s -> 19068.04s]  I think I've jumped to getting it.
[19068.04s -> 19088.06s]  No, I don't.
[19088.06s -> 19100.44s]  I have to jump.
[19100.44s -> 19103.19s]  Did I get it?
[19103.19s -> 19121.21s]  Aha, I did it.
[19121.21s -> 19122.45s]  Listen to the megaphone.
[19131.42s -> 19135.35s]  Still wear those beads on your arm?
[19135.35s -> 19153.32s]  Talking about my crystals.
[19153.32s -> 19163.67s]  All right, do I need to?
[19163.67s -> 19166.35s]  Yeah, I had a black tourmaline bracelet on one day
[19166.35s -> 19169.75s]  and everybody thought I was like a healer or something.
[19169.75s -> 19195.61s]  And it's like, I just liked it.
[19195.61s -> 19210.68s]  I wonder if I do this.
[19210.68s -> 19213.21s]  And this will be kind of far away,
[19213.25s -> 19217.87s]  which means I can teleport up there.
[19217.87s -> 19221.85s]  Aha, yes.
[19221.85s -> 19235.30s]  This is to get it in the right spot.
[19235.30s -> 19238.70s]  This place, it's old now.
[19238.70s -> 19240.34s]  Fallen apart.
[19240.34s -> 19243.46s]  Data left alone for too long.
[19243.46s -> 19244.78s]  Corrupt.
[19244.78s -> 19246.74s]  Please, be mindful.
[19251.13s -> 19259.17s]  Only got two more levels left or two more areas.
[19259.17s -> 19262.94s]  What's the mechanic in this one?
[19262.94s -> 19271.44s]  Camera's back.
[19271.44s -> 19273.73s]  Weird.
[19273.73s -> 19279.51s]  Hiraia left.
[19279.51s -> 19280.35s]  These.
[19280.35s -> 19281.88s]  These.
[19281.88s -> 19284.99s]  If these have struck the light here,
[19284.99s -> 19286.59s]  something must be wrong with the camera.
[19286.59s -> 19288.15s]  Because I don't want to forget.
[19288.15s -> 19289.23s]  This is dangerous.
[19289.23s -> 19291.27s]  We came here to challenge wonders,
[19291.27s -> 19296.70s]  but now we are left.
[19296.70s -> 19298.88s]  Don't seem to fit together.
[19298.88s -> 19302.12s]  Perhaps our time will be better used out there
[19302.12s -> 19303.70s]  and in the world.
[19303.70s -> 19306.36s]  Hiraia must have felt.
[19306.36s -> 19309.01s]  How could you?
[19309.01s -> 19311.21s]  One battery, it destroys everything
[19311.21s -> 19313.86s]  it takes a picture of now, which.
[19315.56s -> 19318.53s]  When was the last time I heard somebody do that?
[19318.53s -> 19319.37s]  These.
[19319.37s -> 19321.21s]  So what if the weather disruptor didn't work?
[19321.21s -> 19323.01s]  This can't be the end of everything.
[19323.97s -> 19329.28s]  Search all the memories.
[19329.28s -> 19330.12s]  I gave up.
[19330.12s -> 19332.36s]  Okay.
[19332.36s -> 19335.04s]  I refuse to leave this place until I know the answer.
[19335.04s -> 19337.16s]  Until I save everything.
[19355.76s -> 19371.33s]  I need like a, sort of a bridge or something.
[19371.33s -> 19394.04s]  Hmm.
[19394.04s -> 19426.07s]  Is that far enough?
[19426.07s -> 19426.91s]  Whoa.
[19426.91s -> 19443.18s]  I forgot everything.
[19443.18s -> 19464.77s]  I got to take a picture in front and then behind.
[19464.77s -> 19480.40s]  There we go.
[19480.40s -> 19483.36s]  This is wild.
[19483.36s -> 19496.28s]  Wild.
[19496.28s -> 19499.66s]  I'll give you a baby scoop ice cream.
[19499.66s -> 19503.00s]  I just, it's a manageable scoop.
[19503.00s -> 19506.66s]  And sometimes I just want one, just a little bit.
[19506.66s -> 19508.66s]  Especially if it's something like, oh yeah, here.
[19508.66s -> 19510.82s]  Here's our, our special, you know,
[19510.82s -> 19512.62s]  blueberry cheesecake ice cream.
[19512.62s -> 19514.02s]  It's like, okay, I just, I don't want a whole,
[19514.02s -> 19514.86s]  I don't want a lot of that.
[19514.86s -> 19515.70s]  I just want enough.
[19515.70s -> 19529.14s]  But it sounds great.
[19529.14s -> 19532.03s]  It's pretty here.
[19532.03s -> 19534.43s]  And the sound of the wind is nice.
[19534.43s -> 19537.94s]  Is this what yours once was?
[19537.94s -> 19540.66s]  Is this what you're trying to get back to?
[19543.39s -> 19548.77s]  Maybe take a picture of the windmill?
[19548.77s -> 19553.40s]  Ow.
[19553.44s -> 19555.80s]  You're going to get a sample and get full from it.
[19555.80s -> 19562.04s]  Now I want one scoop of blueberry cheesecake ice cream
[19562.04s -> 19571.84s]  or strawberry cheesecake or fudge cheesecake.
[19571.84s -> 19578.45s]  Or, oh, it's nine o'clock.
[19578.45s -> 19580.32s]  It's over.
[19580.32s -> 19582.20s]  I'm about to say something that's going to really,
[19582.20s -> 19583.04s]  I, and you know what?
[19583.04s -> 19587.40s]  I might not even say it
[19587.40s -> 19589.00s]  because a lot of you are going to hear this
[19589.00s -> 19595.68s]  and it's going to be a sigh of God damn it.
[19595.68s -> 19597.40s]  Butter crunch ice cream.
[19597.40s -> 19598.81s]  I'm just going to wing it.
[19598.81s -> 19600.25s]  You're completely out of my range.
[19600.25s -> 19601.09s]  Yeah.
[19601.09s -> 19603.13s]  I can't find you.
[19603.13s -> 19604.45s]  Vitals are still fine.
[19604.45s -> 19607.56s]  Like you're in a deep sleep.
[19607.56s -> 19609.00s]  New game plan.
[19609.00s -> 19609.84s]  What is that?
[19609.84s -> 19612.25s]  You're going to need to break the system somehow.
[19612.25s -> 19614.84s]  It's butter pecan ice cream,
[19614.84s -> 19616.96s]  but there's no pecans in it.
[19616.96s -> 19619.08s]  There's just little crunchies in it.
[19619.08s -> 19626.62s]  It's that delicious, buttery, sweet flavor.
[19626.62s -> 19627.70s]  That's boomer ice cream?
[19627.70s -> 19634.13s]  It is not, please.
[19634.13s -> 19635.33s]  It is awesome.
[19635.33s -> 19636.17s]  It's really good.
[19636.17s -> 19637.89s]  Mirren is refusing to listen to reason.
[19637.89s -> 19639.21s]  You Americans disgust me.
[19639.21s -> 19642.52s]  I'm not the only one who put time to this project
[19642.52s -> 19644.44s]  and it's not wholly a failure.
[19644.44s -> 19646.40s]  That's a green eggs and ham moment.
[19646.40s -> 19648.60s]  I even built a simulation of the world outside
[19648.60s -> 19649.44s]  just to keep track of the climate.
[19649.44s -> 19650.28s]  Just wait till they take a bite.
[19650.28s -> 19652.66s]  But it's not enough.
[19652.66s -> 19653.98s]  It needs a solution.
[19653.98s -> 19655.14s]  Some things just aren't.
[19655.14s -> 19656.98s]  Oh, I think I was supposed to copy this.
[19656.98s -> 19671.72s]  Not like this.
[19671.72s -> 19685.25s]  The only thing I can copy.
[19685.25s -> 19688.13s]  Best Ben and Jerry's flavor that is half baked.
[19695.75s -> 19698.91s]  You have a, oh shit, I do have the camera.
[19698.91s -> 19701.14s]  Oops.
[19701.14s -> 19708.73s]  I don't need it.
[19709.09s -> 19711.34s]  Okay, I just beat it.
[19711.34s -> 19738.95s]  Watch this.
[19738.95s -> 19740.03s]  Half baked is my go-to.
[19740.03s -> 19745.55s]  Yeah, I think it's just the easiest one.
[19745.55s -> 19749.13s]  It's definitely the easiest one to get.
[19749.13s -> 19750.89s]  There's a lot of other good ones for Ben and Jerry's too,
[19750.89s -> 19756.83s]  but half baked is just the best one to get.
[19756.83s -> 19759.48s]  Fish food's pretty good.
[19759.48s -> 19766.77s]  I'm a sucker for marshmallow, so.
[19766.77s -> 19779.62s]  Okay, just one.
[19779.62s -> 19787.30s]  Good enough.
[19787.30s -> 19798.69s]  Hmm, interesting.
[19798.69s -> 19803.12s]  No more film on the camera.
[19803.12s -> 19809.40s]  Can I jump over there?
[19809.40s -> 19828.41s]  Hmm, did I do this wrong?
[19828.41s -> 19841.80s]  Not this way, right?
[19841.80s -> 19845.86s]  Oh, there it is.
[19845.86s -> 19860.43s]  Okay, it's right here.
[19860.43s -> 19869.46s]  Hmm, I think I just did it.
[19869.46s -> 19878.35s]  I did it.
[19878.35s -> 19879.56s]  There is one.
[19879.56s -> 19880.40s]  I feel secure.
[19880.40s -> 19881.24s]  This is the last one?
[19881.24s -> 19882.40s]  Just as your friend said.
[19882.40s -> 19883.24s]  What about up top?
[19883.24s -> 19885.54s]  I wanna see up top.
[19885.54s -> 19888.53s]  Last level, so let's take a look.
[19888.53s -> 19900.59s]  Ah, there's one more.
[19900.59s -> 19903.16s]  Selfie?
[19903.16s -> 19910.28s]  Selfie, but I have the camera.
[19910.28s -> 19922.92s]  Hmm, I'll take another one.
[19922.92s -> 19928.04s]  Yikes.
[19928.04s -> 19933.77s]  Battery, two batteries.
[19933.77s -> 19959.74s]  Ah, I, um, hold on.
[19959.74s -> 19986.08s]  Hmm, I need to get a picture of this.
[19988.41s -> 19990.17s]  What about that moldy ice cream?
[19990.17s -> 19993.69s]  Yeah, but that was my fault for having,
[19993.69s -> 20004.96s]  I didn't realize it was there for that long.
[20004.96s -> 20005.92s]  It wasn't even moldy.
[20005.92s -> 20035.72s]  It was freezer burn.
[20035.72s -> 20051.88s]  That was very funny though, I will admit.
[20051.88s -> 20060.83s]  Timer, that's just, that's the stacker sound.
[20060.83s -> 20070.42s]  Woo, woo, woo, woo.
[20070.42s -> 20079.76s]  And then it goes, oh.
[20079.76s -> 20093.73s]  Hmm, camera.
[20093.73s -> 20108.93s]  Very obviously, I need to, like this, this over here.
[20108.97s -> 20116.16s]  And then take a picture of me there
[20116.16s -> 20125.88s]  and then teleport across the game over there.
[20125.88s -> 20133.41s]  Yes, this is it.
[20133.41s -> 20142.94s]  We're at the end.
[20142.94s -> 20149.11s]  This is the final level.
[20149.11s -> 20150.39s]  I want ice cream so bad now.
[20150.39s -> 20153.60s]  I, I do apologize.
[20153.60s -> 20155.32s]  It's getting later here.
[20155.32s -> 20163.70s]  It is definitely very late where you are potentially.
[20163.70s -> 20169.56s]  Five minutes.
[20169.56s -> 20174.69s]  Choices made.
[20174.69s -> 20183.71s]  Go.
[20183.71s -> 20185.35s]  Oh, this is gonna be a huge fan of the S,
[20185.35s -> 20187.44s]  I can already tell.
[20187.44s -> 20188.28s]  It's still going.
[20188.28s -> 20189.72s]  Why, I'm rewinding time.
[20189.72s -> 20191.76s]  What's happening here?
[20191.76s -> 20194.00s]  What the hell?
[20194.00s -> 20195.79s]  Oh boy.
[20196.11s -> 20200.42s]  Hold on.
[20200.42s -> 20201.62s]  What do I, I don't know.
[20203.89s -> 20204.97s]  Where do I go?
[20204.97s -> 20227.41s]  I just, can I reach another level?
[20227.41s -> 20230.41s]  Where did it, where did it, where did it, where did it,
[20230.41s -> 20244.78s]  where is it?
[20244.78s -> 20265.72s]  There, why did it disappear before?
[20265.72s -> 20275.88s]  Come on, go.
[20275.88s -> 20284.96s]  Hesitation is the enemy of innovation.
[20284.96s -> 20288.12s]  Oh my God, dude, come on, this bullshit.
[20307.66s -> 20309.14s]  Oh my God, I'm not letting it go.
[20309.14s -> 20332.12s]  It's, what am I supposed to do with this?
[20332.12s -> 20345.53s]  Huh, where is it?
[20345.53s -> 20407.72s]  Dude, what am I, what?
[20407.72s -> 20410.80s]  What was the, why is the radio there?
[20410.80s -> 20413.87s]  What was the point of the radio?
[20413.87s -> 20423.53s]  I don't get it.
[20423.53s -> 20424.65s]  It's just a distraction?
[20424.65s -> 20425.49s]  Was it really?
[20425.49s -> 20435.40s]  That's annoying.
[20435.40s -> 20437.88s]  Oh, what about, what's his name?
[20437.88s -> 20438.76s]  I don't know, whatever.
[20438.76s -> 20450.16s]  It's a distraction, just go.
[20450.16s -> 20506.10s]  It's time for distraction news.
[20506.10s -> 20512.09s]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[20512.09s -> 20520.18s]  This fucking level.
[20520.18s -> 20525.48s]  Get up there, you stupid fucking thing.
[20525.48s -> 20555.61s]  Oops, I fell off.
[20555.61s -> 20557.33s]  What's this?
[20557.33s -> 20558.93s]  I'll take it, I'll take it.
[20558.93s -> 20582.16s]  Teapot?
[20604.91s -> 20605.75s]  Where are we going?
[20605.75s -> 20609.00s]  Where are we going?
[20609.00s -> 20609.84s]  This way?
[20609.84s -> 20611.88s]  I need two batteries.
[20611.88s -> 20613.22s]  Two, oh my goodness.
[20615.08s -> 20625.35s]  Oh shit.
[20625.35s -> 20627.63s]  Why did, where are the batteries?
[20627.63s -> 20632.60s]  Oh, oh boy.
[20636.61s -> 20670.00s]  Okay, wait, don't do that yet.
[20670.00s -> 20670.88s]  Hurry up, come on.
[20683.40s -> 20684.92s]  What the fuck did I just do?
[20692.05s -> 20697.53s]  Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, come on.
[20697.53s -> 20700.49s]  Wait, where, wait, hold on.
[20701.17s -> 20704.13s]  What the heck just happened?
[20704.13s -> 20706.05s]  Oh shit, this is not real.
[20706.05s -> 20711.26s]  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[20711.26s -> 20719.73s]  Ah, um, ah, ooh, ah.
[20751.39s -> 20752.23s]  All right, what do I need?
[20752.23s -> 20755.70s]  Do I need batteries?
[20755.70s -> 20756.54s]  What are you trying?
[20756.54s -> 20758.46s]  Okay, go around the pillar in a circle,
[20758.46s -> 20759.30s]  but what's the pillar?
[20759.30s -> 20762.62s]  Where is it?
[20762.62s -> 20763.74s]  Where is it?
[20763.74s -> 20764.58s]  Where is it?
[20764.58s -> 20765.42s]  Where is it?
[20765.42s -> 20777.12s]  Where is it?
[20777.12s -> 20795.48s]  Should I take another one?
[20795.48s -> 20801.30s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[20802.75s -> 20805.10s]  Come on, dude, do it.
[20805.86s -> 20807.38s]  You're killing me with this bullshit.
[20807.38s -> 20813.08s]  You are killing me.
[20813.08s -> 20813.92s]  You're killing me with this.
[20813.92s -> 20814.96s]  You're killing me, you're killing me,
[20814.96s -> 20817.77s]  you're killing me, you're killing me.
[20817.77s -> 20819.97s]  You are killing me with this.
[20819.97s -> 20823.40s]  Um, you're killing me.
[20823.40s -> 20828.77s]  No, no, no, it's over, I lose.
[20834.31s -> 20864.61s]  I just got three Luigi notifications in a row.
[20864.61s -> 20903.29s]  Luigi is spam texting me right now.
[20903.29s -> 20913.62s]  Grr, I'm flexing that one.
[20913.62s -> 20925.64s]  Okay, now the battery is down here.
[20925.64s -> 20928.20s]  Fuck, I forget, I forget, I forget.
[20928.20s -> 20929.24s]  Hold on, go back, back, back, back, back.
[20929.24s -> 20933.88s]  What, um, um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[20933.88s -> 20938.84s]  I take, um, I, why did I fucking forget this?
[20938.84s -> 20940.28s]  The photocopier, I forgot I had
[20940.28s -> 20952.06s]  this stupid fucking photocopier.
[20952.06s -> 20953.70s]  I don't even need to take two copies of this.
[20953.70s -> 20977.72s]  I have two, I already have two copies.
[20977.72s -> 21008.31s]  I forget.
[21008.31s -> 21010.43s]  Pace is fine, I got three minutes,
[21010.43s -> 21034.11s]  so it was two and a half minutes.
[21034.47s -> 21038.97s]  Okay, all right, I need two batteries there.
[21041.68s -> 21045.15s]  Okay, we're gonna teleport over there.
[21045.15s -> 21053.36s]  Am I, no, I'm not.
[21053.36s -> 21062.77s]  Okay, all right, all right, now I need to get batteries in.
[21062.77s -> 21067.18s]  I need the radio.
[21067.18s -> 21070.80s]  Do I actually need the radio?
[21070.80s -> 21074.92s]  Where's the radio?
[21074.92s -> 21079.53s]  Where's the radio?
[21079.53s -> 21085.66s]  Can't I power this some other way?
[21085.66s -> 21101.50s]  Take a picture of, um, oh my God.
[21101.50s -> 21102.34s]  Bleh!
[21107.45s -> 21109.36s]  Okay.
[21111.60s -> 21114.80s]  All right, now, where's the, wait, wait.
[21120.56s -> 21122.72s]  Oh no, oh no.
[21122.72s -> 21126.56s]  I need to take a picture of this whole thing.
[21126.56s -> 21130.88s]  Oh, it's over, I think it's, I think it's over.
[21130.88s -> 21138.51s]  Boys and girls, it might be over right now.
[21138.51s -> 21144.45s]  Oh, fuck off with this stupid horse shit.
[21144.45s -> 21162.75s]  Oh, God damn it, this is really hard.
[21162.75s -> 21181.71s]  Get these bushes out of my face.
[21181.71s -> 21187.92s]  Okay, I'm gonna take a picture of the radio.
[21195.96s -> 21196.80s]  We're good.
[21196.80s -> 21199.04s]  All right, I gotta stop fucking laughing,
[21199.04s -> 21204.19s]  like stop laughing.
[21204.19s -> 21215.69s]  I, get this shit away from me.
[21215.69s -> 21235.44s]  I'm good, okay, everything's better.
[21235.44s -> 21248.35s]  I just need two of these, that's it.
[21248.35s -> 21269.98s]  Oh, oh, I forgot, I forget.
[21269.98s -> 21272.88s]  It's gone already, why is it gone?
[21272.88s -> 21298.40s]  I remember, I don't even need two of these,
[21298.40s -> 21299.32s]  but I'm gonna take two
[21299.32s -> 21310.09s]  because maybe the last level needs it.
[21310.09s -> 21313.29s]  All right, let's go, plenty of time.
[21313.29s -> 21319.64s]  Just use the radio, boom.
[21319.64s -> 21323.71s]  That shit is so far away.
[21324.35s -> 21326.31s]  Oh, you're driving me fucking crazy with this.
[21326.31s -> 21336.07s]  What, just drop it.
[21336.07s -> 21342.14s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[21342.14s -> 21343.30s]  What was the point of that?
[21343.30s -> 21344.74s]  Why did I just even do that?
[21344.74s -> 21355.79s]  What?
[21355.79s -> 21356.63s]  I did it.
[21356.63s -> 21357.47s]  You did well.
[21357.47s -> 21358.31s]  Thank God.
[21358.31s -> 21360.68s]  It's thanks to you.
[21360.68s -> 21362.72s]  I got, I got it, I got it, everything's fine.
[21362.72s -> 21368.68s]  She was desperate, but I see now,
[21368.68s -> 21370.12s]  there is no singular truth.
[21370.12s -> 21373.47s]  That was tough, that's not a perfect answer.
[21373.47s -> 21376.68s]  Anything meeting you in this place
[21376.68s -> 21382.81s]  was the closest I would ever get to knowing.
[21382.85s -> 21386.12s]  The red world that awaits you.
[21386.12s -> 21388.11s]  Is it loving?
[21388.11s -> 21400.28s]  Is it healing?
[21400.28s -> 21401.96s]  Ow, what?
[21401.96s -> 21406.56s]  You didn't tell me there's physical force in these, man.
[21406.56s -> 21408.92s]  I see.
[21408.92s -> 21411.36s]  Suppose our time has come to an end.
[21412.28s -> 21417.04s]  Thank you for stopping by.
[21417.04s -> 21422.64s]  I wish you well.
[21422.64s -> 21426.16s]  This is the real final level then.
[21426.16s -> 21428.96s]  I beat the level already.
[21428.96s -> 21431.80s]  You really get, I'm gonna get a Luigi text
[21431.80s -> 21434.29s]  before I even get to try it.
[21434.29s -> 21435.13s]  That's kind of,
[21435.13s -> 21484.48s]  that's like the last plant on earth or something.
[21484.48s -> 21503.64s]  Don't drop it.
[21503.64s -> 21507.68s]  You probably need some rest.
[21507.68s -> 21508.72s]  Too good to be true.
[21510.52s -> 21514.08s]  So awful.
[21514.08s -> 21515.16s]  Not yet.
[21515.16s -> 21518.10s]  We can keep brainstorming on that.
[21518.10s -> 21519.18s]  Hmm?
[21519.18s -> 21521.28s]  Wait, what's that?
[21521.28s -> 21522.12s]  I got the plant.
[21522.12s -> 21535.23s]  What kind of plant was that?
[21535.23s -> 21539.57s]  I did it.
[21539.57s -> 21548.91s]  I got the good ending.
[21548.91s -> 21550.69s]  Well, that was great.
[21550.69s -> 21554.08s]  That was a really fun game.
[21554.08s -> 21556.04s]  I enjoyed that the whole way through.
[21579.08s -> 21582.52s]  Should have taken, should have taken the kitty.
[21582.52s -> 21591.12s]  But you, what's wrong with you?
[21591.12s -> 21594.21s]  Most streamers beat this in 20 minutes.
[21594.21s -> 21597.90s]  The opening cut scene and tutorial is 20 minutes.
[21597.90s -> 21609.70s]  Nice try though.
[21609.70s -> 21612.31s]  Speedruns will be fun with this though.
[21612.31s -> 21613.85s]  People will break this.
[21613.85s -> 21615.37s]  They'll take a picture of something like three times
[21615.37s -> 21632.38s]  and crash it or something.
[21632.38s -> 21635.72s]  There's a lot of levels.
[21635.72s -> 21638.36s]  That third chapter had like 20 something levels.
[21638.36s -> 21645.77s]  22, 23.
[21645.77s -> 21649.30s]  The any% right now is 24 minutes.
[21649.30s -> 21665.02s]  Jeez, that seems hard.
[21665.02s -> 21667.22s]  You're gonna do bouncing duck sim?
[21667.22s -> 21668.06s]  Yeah, not tonight though.
[21668.06s -> 21682.86s]  I think we've been live for a decent amount of time.
[21682.86s -> 21687.52s]  I'll be live again on Monday
[21688.28s -> 21689.64s]  and Monday is an interesting day
[21689.64s -> 21697.18s]  because armored core is an option,
[21697.18s -> 21708.88s]  but so is bouncing duck simulator.
[21708.88s -> 21710.60s]  The U2's also launches on Monday.
[21710.60s -> 21714.22s]  Well, it's for sale on Monday.
[21714.22s -> 21719.14s]  I don't think it delivers for a month or two after that.
[21719.14s -> 21723.08s]  But bouncing duck looks, that was a poke recommendation.
[21723.08s -> 21725.28s]  I looked it up.
[21725.28s -> 21728.80s]  It looks pretty great.
[21728.80s -> 21737.96s]  So we'll figure it out tomorrow for a Monday.
[21737.96s -> 21741.25s]  And then later in the week after Monday,
[21741.25s -> 21748.20s]  probably on maybe Sunday, Friday, Sunday, I'll pick a day.
[21748.20s -> 21753.29s]  We'll get back into Sorcery part four.
[21753.33s -> 21755.54s]  Oh no, you guys are right.
[21755.54s -> 21759.90s]  I didn't, I didn't save Kate.
[21759.90s -> 21760.74s]  That's on me.
[21760.74s -> 21767.23s]  That's my bad.
[21767.23s -> 21769.37s]  Very cool.
[21769.37s -> 21773.20s]  I give it a very, very, very fun out of 10.
[21773.20s -> 21774.71s]  That was very good.
[21774.71s -> 21778.68s]  Very enjoyable.
[21778.68s -> 21790.76s]  Just the core gameplay mechanic alone is worth playing it.
[21790.76s -> 21793.87s]  That's, that's it.
[21793.87s -> 21803.37s]  Perfect timing, I guess.
[21803.37s -> 21804.69s]  People said this was a three hour game
[21804.69s -> 21809.24s]  and it was gonna take you six hours.
[21809.24s -> 21813.74s]  Yeah, but I feel like it,
[21813.74s -> 21817.06s]  even if I, even if you blow through every level,
[21817.06s -> 21824.68s]  I feel like it would take you more than three hours.
[21824.68s -> 21826.20s]  I did do the optional levels too.
[21826.20s -> 21828.56s]  Almost all of them,
[21828.56s -> 21838.20s]  which I'm sure that added at least 45 minutes to an hour.
[21838.20s -> 21841.24s]  Pretty average play time.
[21841.24s -> 21843.32s]  Yeah, and we also talk about ice cream
[21843.32s -> 21846.79s]  and ketchup and mustard combinations.
[21846.79s -> 21850.43s]  You always have to add the streamer one to two hour
[21850.43s -> 21861.84s]  of I'm walking in a circle and talking.
[21861.84s -> 21867.13s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys on Monday.
[21867.13s -> 21872.79s]  Gonna start with Bouncing Duck Simulator.
[21872.79s -> 21878.24s]  And after, I might just play that the whole day.
[21878.24s -> 21881.08s]  If I get over that or get bored of that,
[21881.08s -> 21887.44s]  it might be an attempt of Armored Core 6.
[21887.44s -> 21889.08s]  Either one of those two will be on Monday.
[21889.08s -> 21897.43s]  And then later in the weekend, we'll do Sorcery.
[21897.43s -> 21898.70s]  Thanks again.
[21898.70s -> 21899.54s]  See you soon.
[21899.54s -> 21900.36s]  Take care of yourselves.
[21900.36s -> 21906.62s]  Get some sleep.
[21906.62s -> 21917.86s]  Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[21917.86s -> 21920.12s]  Bye, even though mustard is dog shit.
[21920.12s -> 21923.78s]  Hey, we can have different opinions.
[21923.78s -> 21927.01s]  Yours is just wrong.
[21927.01s -> 21934.62s]  Thanks for coming though.
[21934.62s -> 21945.27s]  I'm a mustard Andy, okay?
[21945.27s -> 21947.88s]  That emote, how many emotes?
[21947.88s -> 21953.52s]  I just, why are these emotes even here?
[21953.52s -> 21957.56s]  Does anybody think German mustard is still funny
[21957.56s -> 21970.72s]  from like 2016?
[21970.72s -> 21974.98s]  That was, I don't know what to put for an emote slot.
[21974.98s -> 21977.30s]  And there are subscriptions on the channel.
[21978.06s -> 21980.16s]  I have to come up with something.
[21980.16s -> 21982.70s]  Guess this is what it is.
[21982.70s -> 21985.10s]  And then eight years went by
[21985.10s -> 21999.85s]  and I added one or two more emotes.
[21999.85s -> 22007.45s]  Honestly, I think the BTTV emotes just sort of took over.
[22007.45s -> 22009.11s]  It was just, if something was,
[22009.11s -> 22016.54s]  the mods was just added.
[22016.54s -> 22018.74s]  That way everybody can just use them.
[22018.74s -> 22022.02s]  Some of them I think deserve to be sub emotes,
[22022.02s -> 22034.74s]  but a lot of them just should be BTTV.
[22034.74s -> 22036.40s]  All right, see you Monday.
[22036.40s -> 22037.24s]  Take care.
[22037.24s -> 22038.70s]  Call your mother.
[22038.70s -> 22052.45s]  Drink some water.
[22052.45s -> 22057.82s]  Take care of yourself.
[22057.82s -> 22059.56s]  In what order?
[22059.56s -> 22066.39s]  Whatever order you are comfortable.
[22068.23s -> 22069.37s]  See you Monday.
[22069.37s -> 22121.65s]  Take care.
