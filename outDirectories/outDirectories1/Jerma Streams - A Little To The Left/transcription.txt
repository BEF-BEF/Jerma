[29.62s -> 51.32s]  How's it going? I'm not late. I'm out maybe, I am 60 seconds, 30 seconds, maybe if that.
[51.96s -> 65.94s]  Would you ask what size toothpick do you use? I don't, I don't think I've ever used a toothpick
[65.94s -> 77.98s]  based on, buying it based on its size. I think I've only ever, I think I've only ever bought
[77.98s -> 87.91s]  toothpicks maybe three times in my entire life. And I really mean that maybe two or three times
[87.91s -> 98.22s]  total. Where's driver? All right, hold on. Just wait, I'll explain. I'll talk about it. Just wait a
[98.22s -> 112.74s]  minute. I wanted to ask how the tortoise you hit an Elden Ring but you never finished off is doing.
[113.62s -> 125.35s]  Will you just go drink a glass of water? Does somebody know? Does somebody say true?
[126.15s -> 137.80s]  No, they didn't. Did I make that up? No, nobody did. I made it up. True. Change your pinned tweet.
[139.88s -> 147.11s]  I can't, I can't yet. All right, let's talk. Here's the deal. I was going to play driver today.
[149.58s -> 159.53s]  I decided not to because I was going to play it on PC but the PC version is kind of all messed up
[159.53s -> 164.57s]  on any of the newer operating systems. There's a patch you can get that fixes a lot of stuff
[165.21s -> 175.50s]  but it still has resolution issues. So what I've decided to do is this, not today
[176.73s -> 181.13s]  but I don't know later on this coming week, this coming weekend, maybe something like that.
[182.41s -> 189.51s]  I'm just going to get it from PlayStation 1 and we're going back. We're going back to PlayStation
[189.51s -> 203.69s]  1 Xbox old console Insanity Night. Kicking it off with driver one. We're going to do a,
[205.51s -> 213.00s]  is that considered retro? I don't know. Retro in my brain and maybe it's because we're,
[213.72s -> 223.56s]  you know, different ages but when I think of retro I think of Pong. I think of the NES. I think of
[223.56s -> 230.71s]  the Super Nintendo. Is retro PS2? Is that considered retro or is that some in-between period?
[233.02s -> 246.58s]  How many years have to go by for something to be retro? 10, 15, 20 years? 15, 20? I don't think a
[246.58s -> 253.30s]  decade. I think a decade is not long enough. Please at least try King's Field 1 and 2.
[256.78s -> 264.17s]  Pong is vintage. PS2 would be retro. That's true. Did you start Mob Psycho? I did not.
[266.15s -> 272.74s]  No, I did not. PS3 would be retro if it was a decade. Yeah, that's not enough. These would
[272.74s -> 285.27s]  be at least 15, 20. But anyways, that is what's happening this weekend. So today, change of plans
[285.27s -> 294.07s]  today. Gonna just play something fun, something cozy. I've, you know, had my eye on a few games.
[294.79s -> 304.74s]  Landed on this one called A Little to the Left. It's a game about organizing. I think it's kind
[304.74s -> 311.85s]  of in the same world as that unpacking game, I think. So we'll see. I don't know. It's like
[311.85s -> 322.60s]  a puzzle game where you have to organize things correctly. I think. He's gonna mauled. I don't
[322.60s -> 329.78s]  think so. So we're gonna have a chill day today. Just gonna relax, play a little bit. And this
[329.78s -> 336.66s]  takes us not very long. We'll do something else. Are you gonna play Tetris? I'm never gonna play
[336.66s -> 353.16s]  Tetris. Jerma, don't chill. Why not? I can't play Tetris. We've talked about this a thousand
[353.16s -> 361.50s]  times. I cannot play Tetris. I put down the first row and then just start shaking. I just hate it.
[361.50s -> 370.38s]  I have to get out. I don't even get past one cycle of dun dun dun dun dun dun dun. One cycle of that
[370.38s -> 380.18s]  and I'm gone. I just, honestly, I played Tetris just to hear that song once. And I go, all right,
[380.18s -> 391.96s]  that was fun. No more. Played Beam NG? I did a few months ago, right? A couple months ago.
[392.68s -> 402.34s]  Let's play Checkers. Frog Detective, you liar. The longer you wait for Frog Detective when it
[402.34s -> 413.27s]  actually happens, you're going to freak out. You should play with chat GPT. You know, maybe I will
[413.27s -> 423.45s]  as soon here, but I don't have that prepared. You should play Pong. Pong to me sounds more like a
[423.45s -> 437.14s]  punishment stream. Like you gotta play Pong for an hour. I want you to be honest. Would you play Pong
[437.78s -> 449.91s]  for one straight hour? I'm seeing, I'm seeing a ton of nos. No, no, no, no, no way. No way.
[450.47s -> 457.53s]  Okay. What would it take for you to play Pong for one hour? Would someone have to pay you to play
[457.53s -> 468.07s]  Pong? Not versus the person. No, versus the computer. Pong versus the computer for one hour.
[468.71s -> 485.29s]  100 bucks, 50 bucks, 100 bucks, $500 dude. What? Actually, I mean, that like sucks. Playing Pong
[485.29s -> 489.29s]  and that's all you can do for an hour. That's true. That actually would be, that'd actually,
[489.29s -> 502.62s]  yeah, that'd be hard to sit there for more than like 30, 40 minutes. 50 bucks, 40 bucks. I would
[502.62s -> 510.58s]  do it for a Philly cheesesteak. You know, that's actually pretty good. A real one. You mean like
[510.58s -> 517.86s]  from Philadelphia, not the people that just say Philly cheesesteak, but we're in Cincinnati and
[517.86s -> 522.58s]  it's not even close. Do you mean like a real one from Philadelphia? I think it's, I would play Pong
[522.58s -> 528.57s]  for five hours to get one of those. Yeah. I would play, I would do a full five hour Pong stream.
[529.61s -> 536.73s]  If a, like one of the best Philly cheesesteaks from Philadelphia teleported hot, fresh, ready to go
[537.53s -> 545.53s]  in the middle of my room is worth it for me. Like, and I'm talking nice and hot,
[545.53s -> 548.73s]  fresh. They just made it and it's from one of the best places in Philadelphia.
[549.37s -> 560.23s]  That'd be worth it. No, not on the floor. I mean, I put my hands out and it goes,
[561.59s -> 567.03s]  I put both my hands out and it does the camera trick that was shocking back in the fifties,
[567.59s -> 574.18s]  where you just hold your arms out and, and then they cut and then they put the sandwich there
[574.90s -> 579.78s]  and they roll again and they make a sound effect and the actor kind of shifts a little and like
[579.78s -> 587.67s]  moves their arms up or down a little bit and it's just there in their hands. That's what I want.
[588.23s -> 597.69s]  What the fuck is a cheesesteak? What? Oh my God. Really? You don't know if that is. I mean,
[597.69s -> 607.78s]  I wouldn't eat one every day. I'm a new viewer. Hi. That's interesting considering you've been
[607.78s -> 615.98s]  subscribed for 29 straight months. I don't know if you're on somebody else's computer right now, but
[618.31s -> 626.78s]  you've been here for years. I don't know what a cheesesteak is either. A cheesesteak is
[628.07s -> 636.74s]  shaved or chopped steak that you cook on a flat top and you put maybe some onions in it. I don't
[636.74s -> 644.02s]  know. It depends on who you talk to. You put some cheese on it, slide it into a big, nice hoagie
[644.02s -> 651.78s]  roll, cheese whiz on it. I don't know. I would, I, I've never had a real one. I've just had
[651.78s -> 665.06s]  imitations. No, you don't put milk on it. What are your thoughts on schnitzel? I'm a new viewer as
[665.06s -> 675.24s]  well. Um, schnitzel's awesome. Anything that's breaded and, you know, smashed to a point where
[675.24s -> 689.94s]  it's crispy and delicious. Of course it's going to be great. What about haggis? No, I've never,
[689.94s -> 695.30s]  I'm not going to eat haggis. All right. Hey, is this, is this food AMA hour or are we playing a
[695.30s -> 701.05s]  game? Well, it's a chill stream. We can, whatever. All right. Okay. A little to the left. Let's,
[701.05s -> 711.13s]  let's play it. See how it is. If you can hear it. You can now. There we go. Okay. So this game is
[711.13s -> 716.95s]  going to be super cool. I don't know. I don't have, I'm not going to eat sir. What is it? Sir
[716.95s -> 725.06s]  Stroming? No. Oh, eat sir Stroming. You mean the thing where people literally take a can opener,
[726.55s -> 732.54s]  puncture it, start to turn. And then all of a sudden everybody in the area goes,
[736.52s -> 745.82s]  no, it's a, every single time I've ever seen a sir. Oh, we're going to do a sir Stroming thing.
[745.82s -> 754.84s]  They puncture the can. It goes something that can fill the air with that much smell in less
[754.84s -> 770.44s]  than one second is something I don't want to put near my face. Okay. I don't want that near my face.
[770.44s -> 779.02s]  Your face cam is on right now. All right. So how does this work? I'm ready to organize. Would you
[779.02s -> 785.34s]  ever eat haggis? No, I'm not. I'm not going to eat foods. I don't want to eat home sweet home.
[785.34s -> 797.02s]  All right. This is going to be cool. Are you guys ready? There he is. Okay. So how do I do this?
[797.02s -> 808.89s]  Where's the fucking safe? Where's the fucking safe? Is that right? Oh, I did. Okay. I actually,
[808.89s -> 824.76s]  I had to do, Oh wait, I have to organize this. Should I do, honestly, it's just all going in
[824.76s -> 830.86s]  there without any rhyme or reason because I don't do, are you going to, that's going to get messed
[830.86s -> 834.70s]  up anyways. That your pet goes over there, picks out whatever they want and then just knocks the
[834.70s -> 865.27s]  whole thing over. Is that right? Oh, this color up here. Okay. Hold on. I feel like I'm watching a
[865.27s -> 881.06s]  baby sensory video. All right. Hold on. This is, it's getting a little hard. How do I know
[881.06s -> 915.75s]  where the beginning is? It's right there, right? Yeah. I had it. Here we go. It's right there. I
[915.75s -> 918.87s]  had it right. I had it correct. This is, I didn't know I had to, I thought they had to be touching.
[918.87s -> 937.64s]  There you go. This shit drives me crazy in real life. Every time I, I, something on the wall,
[937.64s -> 943.21s]  like a painting or a picture or something, and you have to get it sorted, but the music just
[943.21s -> 967.58s]  changed. This is by size. Is it big on the bottom? Okay. It's big on the bottom like that. That kind
[967.58s -> 993.91s]  of felt good. Slow down. I can't keep up. You're going to be all right. Where's the ding? Is it,
[993.91s -> 1012.55s]  does it want to buy thickness or does it want to buy height or thickness? Here it is. I got it.
[1012.55s -> 1039.56s]  It was height. Shit. I should have gone, I should have gone bottom to top. Sick. You legitimately
[1039.56s -> 1074.22s]  look like a toddler. That's very weird. Stamps. Yes. What's going on? Oh, oh, these are animals
[1074.22s -> 1090.34s]  up here. Okay. Now I sort them. No, we're good. This is, I like this. Are you seriously faking?
[1090.34s -> 1097.26s]  Okay. You don't, I'm sorry, but you don't open up like a chill game and just like relax and play it
[1097.26s -> 1103.14s]  and have somebody be annoyed with how you are chilling. Are you really mad at how I'm chilling
[1103.14s -> 1109.96s]  right now? How I'm chilling? Hey bro, dude, ah, you're not chilling the right way. You're
[1109.96s -> 1117.80s]  not doing it right. You can't, you can't tell somebody how to chill. This is not a backseat
[1117.80s -> 1123.77s]  scenario. This is a chilling out scenario. You don't walk into somebody's room. Nah, dude,
[1123.77s -> 1131.90s]  you're doing it wrong. You're not chilling out right. Hey, did you smoke yet? You smoked today?
[1131.90s -> 1149.21s]  No. Ah, fucking idiot. You fucking idiot. All right. Listen, I'm chilling again, but you're
[1149.21s -> 1155.61s]  going to walk in my room. You're going to walk in my room, holding one in. You know what I mean?
[1155.61s -> 1163.24s]  Like you just walk in. What's up, dude? Fucking cough out that smoke. And like you, you, why didn't
[1163.24s -> 1168.74s]  you just breathe that hit up before you walked in the room? What is this? What is this for kids?
[1168.74s -> 1228.22s]  Is this a kids game? Bro, I'm chilling. Don't tell me how to, how to do it. Oh, I thought it was
[1228.22s -> 1238.63s]  making a circle. I thought it was making a big circle. I'm trying to make a circle. Don't tell
[1238.63s -> 1262.07s]  me how to chill. This is not what I thought it was going to be. Did I just do that wrong, but still
[1262.07s -> 1280.41s]  got it right? What am I doing? Oh, what do these say? Are these colors? Why is two written upside?
[1280.41s -> 1297.02s]  No, is that a two upside down? What is that? What is one? This one's two, one, two, three, four, five.
[1297.02s -> 1305.70s]  All right. What does that have to do with the colors? I got it. You didn't, you did not know
[1305.70s -> 1332.09s]  that until I just did that. You actually did not know until you saw me do it. Idiot. There we go.
[1332.09s -> 1348.25s]  I like this game calendar. All right. The second this gets to be, they're going to, they're going
[1348.25s -> 1352.25s]  to pull a papers, please. Isn't it? It's going to get so hard. I think it's going to get too much
[1352.25s -> 1367.53s]  for me. We'll find out. I'm chilling. Yes, I am. Once papers, please introduced the fourth thing
[1367.53s -> 1379.66s]  you had to pay attention to. I just let everybody in. Once it was like ID, birth certificate, work
[1379.66s -> 1383.75s]  form. Once it got to be three or four different things, I just was like, you know what? Let me
[1383.75s -> 1392.90s]  look at the ID and then stamp you or whatever. All right. Speaking of this. All right. Here we go.
[1392.90s -> 1404.46s]  This is, wait, what? Whoa. That actually had, you had to pull it. Look at this. You have to rip it
[1404.46s -> 1443.62s]  off. I don't, I don't get it. Or one, two, three, four. I don't get it. One, two, the star is on day
[1443.62s -> 1451.14s]  three and day 12. 12 is divisible by three, three, six, nine, 12 by four. So therefore this has to go
[1451.14s -> 1464.71s]  on the four. I don't know. Three. Um, hold on. Three, 12. That's nine days. So one, two, three, four,
[1464.71s -> 1474.10s]  five, six, seven, eight, nine. I for some reason thought I had to do stuff up here. Okay. So this
[1474.10s -> 1486.18s]  is one, this doesn't show up anymore. Okay. So 10, so 10 days. So then this has to be here. Wait,
[1486.18s -> 1510.17s]  what? Oh no, it's just nine days for everything. Okay. That's be legible. I don't have any more
[1510.17s -> 1538.36s]  of these ones though. Doesn't have to be perfect. Wait, what? What's happening? That's what I meant
[1538.36s -> 1545.98s]  to do. This reminds me of math class. Please stop. You're going to just something in my eye
[1545.98s -> 1579.72s]  every one second. Why'd you do that? I cursed you to have something in your eye. All right. The
[1579.72s -> 1587.11s]  game's called, uh, a little to the left, right? We're going to do this by size. What did you stop
[1587.11s -> 1616.18s]  that? Reverse it. Shit. That's actually kind of hard. I just wanted to do a sorting algorithm.
[1616.18s -> 1653.05s]  Yeah. Like he's the same size. That not it. It's not this height. There's more things than how
[1653.05s -> 1672.38s]  tall something is. Oh God. Wait a minute. How do I know what the first one is? How do I know what
[1672.38s -> 1817.85s]  the first one is? Oh shit. Okay. I just got to get it. Let him cook. What am I doing? I, it's a
[1817.85s -> 1827.66s]  mirror. It's a mirror. I'm sorry, but at this point, if I'm setting up my bookshelf and I am
[1827.66s -> 1837.29s]  looking at this shit, I'm just spinning spine in and we're going height. We're doing spine in
[1837.29s -> 1853.85s]  by height. Is this the middle? This has to be the middle then, right? There wouldn't be a big
[1853.85s -> 1860.04s]  flourish in the middle like this. This is a big flourish. This is a big flourish. It has to be
[1860.04s -> 1956.30s]  the middle. This is, it has to be over here. Why am I taking so long doing this? This has to be in
[1956.30s -> 1970.18s]  the middle, but how do I know what the end, what, how do I know which one's the end? Why even make
[1970.18s -> 1976.33s]  this? Why can't you just make it a name? Make it like, oh, like, like Arthur or like Gregory.
[1976.33s -> 2005.90s]  Just make it so I can put it easy. I'm confused. It's so, it's, it's a mirrored image. So that
[2005.90s -> 2014.98s]  means some of this shit cannot be over here. I'm fucking the whole thing up because nothing can,
[2014.98s -> 2025.59s]  how do I, what can attach to this? This edge is too tall. See what I mean? Like this is,
[2025.59s -> 2041.86s]  this edge is too tall. Nothing can fit here. Is that it? No, it's not. That can't be it, right?
[2041.86s -> 2059.22s]  I don't, I don't, I don't understand it. This is too many symbols on the screen. See, if I was in
[2059.22s -> 2067.42s]  my bed with my iPad, I would be sitting there going like this. It's fucking stupid. This is
[2067.42s -> 2075.86s]  so fucking dumb. Fuck this, this game. This is stupid. This is a fucking dumb game. And then I
[2075.86s -> 2090.46s]  would, I would eventually figure it out and go, oh, this is cute. I like this. Mods, what do I do?
[2090.46s -> 2095.24s]  Give me some guidance. I don't understand. I don't know what, I don't know what the break point is
[2095.24s -> 2112.76s]  for the mirror because like it did, it just goes like this. I don't get it. This, then this is not
[2112.76s -> 2121.69s]  the middle then it can't be. You all said, yes, this is the middle. You are lying to me. There
[2121.69s -> 2129.14s]  ain't nothing that fits here. The only thing that fits here is this. This is it. Nothing else can
[2129.14s -> 2156.86s]  fit here. You had it before. Compare the height of the two mirrored pieces. Height and, height and
[2156.86s -> 2164.97s]  pattern. The hell? Oh, I've thought it was just, I thought it was just pattern this time. Wait,
[2164.97s -> 2179.11s]  height and pattern? This is the worst gamer moment. I just don't understand. It can't be height. No,
[2179.11s -> 2184.76s]  it can't. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's a chill stream, but I'm just going to tell, I'm telling you.
[2184.76s -> 2188.28s]  Some of you guys would open this, but if you're on your fucking iPad and guess what you're going
[2188.28s -> 2193.62s]  to do? You're going to go, I think I'd rather just go eat something. I get a snack and you're going
[2193.62s -> 2201.35s]  to press the home button. It's going to disappear and you can just run away. You get to go, you get
[2201.35s -> 2213.88s]  to go like this. It's gone. It's just pattern. I'm going to blow through the rest of this fucking
[2213.88s -> 2218.74s]  game. I'm telling you right now. I promise you. It's just like the different squigglies. My brain
[2218.74s -> 2223.21s]  just is like, they're all the same. I said this year we're going to chill. We're going to do a
[2223.21s -> 2248.33s]  little bit more chilling. I'm going to be stuck here forever. I just don't understand what they
[2248.33s -> 2262.87s]  want me to do. Just pattern, but it's height and pattern. No shot. You're going to do it. The only,
[2262.87s -> 2268.47s]  the two curly ones are at each end and the one everyone says is the middle is the middle. All
[2268.47s -> 2279.22s]  the rest are doubles. Yeah, but that's what I have, but nothing else can connect to this. Watch this.
[2279.22s -> 2286.06s]  Yeah, that's what I had. See, but nothing else can connect to this. Bro, if it's this, I'm going to
[2286.06s -> 2291.51s]  be real mad. This one doesn't fit. This one, I'm going to be pissed if it's this one. These don't
[2291.51s -> 2301.62s]  fit. These actually don't fit. This is a fucked up weird image and this is not, it doesn't fit.
[2301.62s -> 2307.13s]  It is it, isn't it? It's it. It is it. This doesn't look like it's supposed to fit. This doesn't look
[2307.13s -> 2339.14s]  like it's supposed to fit. What even is this picture? They're all the same image in my head.
[2339.14s -> 2353.82s]  If I don't beat the next one in less than one minute, I will something. Dude, these all blend
[2353.82s -> 2357.86s]  into the same picture in my head. I can't see anything but the same line. They're all the same
[2357.86s -> 2424.36s]  line. What side is this one on? Where does this one go? Dude, where does this one go? This one
[2424.36s -> 2431.32s]  can't be here, right? Like this, because it's, there's two of each one. So there has to be one
[2431.32s -> 2457.67s]  on each side, right? This is correct. So where do these fucking random ass pieces go? Calm down,
[2457.67s -> 2509.69s]  switch them. What do you want me to do? What's wrong with this? I got it. I got it. Give me one
[2509.69s -> 2544.92s]  minute. Give me one minute. Literally one minute. Come on. That's correct right here, please. Wait,
[2544.92s -> 2559.46s]  what is it saying? That's not right. I was just, that's how is it not flat? One minute told you.
[2559.46s -> 2574.86s]  Oh shit. No, no. These little squiggly lines. I can't do the squiggly lines. Oh boy. Everybody
[2574.86s -> 2597.22s]  put it into, don't, no, don't even. You know what I just realized? I'm the guy that walks into the
[2597.22s -> 2608.63s]  room holding in the fucking blunt smoke. I just realized it right now. It's me. I'm the guy that
[2608.63s -> 2624.28s]  leans in. Who is this? Ah, now fuck that. I'm gonna go play Super Mario. So this is correct here.
[2624.28s -> 2662.33s]  It's got a line here. No, I mean, this is correct. This might be bait though. It's in the wrong spot,
[2662.33s -> 2754.50s]  but. Ah, look at that. What is this even supposed to be a picture of? What was that? What is this
[2754.50s -> 2774.38s]  thing? What was that image? It was a doodle. Yeah, but I mean, what was that? I'm trying to make
[2774.38s -> 2795.32s]  pictures. That's my problem. All right. What does this want me to do? Oh, guys, it's by sharpness.
[2795.32s -> 2829.94s]  I got it. It's by sharpness. Oh, the eraser. Guys, we're not getting any dings. It's not
[2829.94s -> 2868.52s]  eraser. It's not sharpness. I mean, there's the rainbow. How come I can't? There's no dings. Oh,
[2868.52s -> 2889.72s]  right. What is this? By thickness? Height? Thickness? It's definitely gonna be size. Small
[2889.72s -> 2908.55s]  to big. Thinness to widthness. Horizontal length. If it's horizontal length, this is it. All right,
[2908.55s -> 2940.06s]  it has to be. This is the maybe biggest horizontal length first. That's what I would think. Yeah,
[2940.06s -> 2947.62s]  horizontal length. I guess not. Maybe smallest horizontal length. But I had that already,
[2947.62s -> 2969.70s]  though. This thing. It's not going to be small to large, right? What? I'm confused. How is it?
[2969.70s -> 3004.55s]  It just wants me to spread them out? Is it? What's the pattern here then? Wait a minute. I think
[3004.55s -> 3020.44s]  it's going to exactly fit on the screen. Yeah. Okay. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[3020.44s -> 3110.89s]  There it is. Great. I'm going. I'm going thinness. This is where we're just talking centimeters. We
[3110.89s -> 3115.37s]  can see all the sweat stains all over you. This is a bright. This came right out of the dryer.
[3115.37s -> 3125.21s]  Yeah, I know there's patterns on it, but I can't you do this more than somebody said you can do
[3125.21s -> 3138.76s]  this more than like a few ways. I can't do it by thickness. Yes, you can. Yeah, I can. I don't have
[3138.76s -> 3169.11s]  to do it by the pattern. It's so close. These three and these four are the problem. Every,
[3169.11s -> 3175.88s]  every book has it. Listen, listen, everybody. I'm going to tell you, you can do each of these
[3175.88s -> 3180.34s]  puzzles three or four different ways. It doesn't have to be the patterns. It can just be how it
[3180.42s -> 3186.10s]  can be. You can be length wise. It can be the the witness. It could be the length. It could be the
[3186.10s -> 3203.45s]  pattern. I'm trying to do it by the witness of the books. Book girth. All right. I'll just do it.
[3203.45s -> 3212.41s]  But is that true? Oh, it was people just lying to me. All right. I'll do it by pattern line,
[3212.41s -> 3240.82s]  line, line. This one is our glass, our glass line line. These lines should be the height of the line
[3240.82s -> 3311.02s]  top to bottom. That'd be a weird way to do this. Is that actually what it is? Oh my God. I thought
[3311.02s -> 3347.98s]  I could do it more than one way. I'd put the pencil shavings back on the pencil. I need to
[3347.98s -> 3364.92s]  get them all out here. What do these all look like? The one, the line. I think I understand it. Hold
[3364.92s -> 3396.22s]  on. Two, one, two, three, no, three, four, one, two, three, four, five. Don't overthink it. What
[3396.22s -> 3405.35s]  do the symbols mean? Overthinking, overthinking, overthinking, overthinking is the complexity of
[3405.35s -> 3410.22s]  the pattern. That's what I was thinking. This is the most complex one, but I don't think that's
[3410.22s -> 3423.90s]  correct. What's with the shavings though? Why are they here? What's the point of these? This is the
[3423.90s -> 3445.10s]  most, this is the least complex line. Just do it by height. I tried that the other time and it didn't
[3445.10s -> 3461.45s]  work. The pencil shavings are the pattern. All right, but how do, what am I supposed to, right?
[3461.45s -> 3471.19s]  Because it's like squiggle, squiggle, squiggle. Just do trial and just brute force it. Try it by
[3471.19s -> 3512.02s]  height. I think that's going to do anything. Get all this shit out of the way. How do I match these
[3512.02s -> 3521.11s]  up? Where am I supposed to place it? Like this one is without a doubt right here, but how do I,
[3521.11s -> 3536.22s]  what am I supposed to, where, wait, what do I put it? Throw them away. Clean them up. Size of the
[3536.22s -> 3543.45s]  shavings with their shape, but wouldn't, this is correct though. This is like, this is like just a
[3543.45s -> 3565.06s]  small one, right? It's just decorative. It's, wait, is it actually just decorative? Let them above or
[3565.06s -> 3607.40s]  below maybe. There ain't enough shavings. Throw them off the screen. What just happened? That's
[3607.40s -> 3667.86s]  what I was supposed to do? I don't know who this artist is.
[3668.34s -> 3676.34s]  But your music is bad. I don't know like what record this is, but it's the same two loops.
[3679.85s -> 3690.71s]  Oh wow. Okay. Okay. I got it. Okay. But hold on. I thought that was different tracks.
[3697.74s -> 3728.70s]  Call that one looking out the window over an airplane. Whoa. Hold on. What kind of soup is
[3728.70s -> 3749.24s]  this? Shit. I'm sorry. I just went like, I got mad. So this is the left side of the can. This is
[3749.24s -> 3761.14s]  the middle of the can, right? Like that. And this is the right side of the can. And what does it want
[3761.14s -> 3771.14s]  me to do? I wonder. This pattern here is this. I don't know what that's trying to tell me.
[3771.14s -> 3789.90s]  What's my IQ? More than you. Last time I took it, it was 70, 71. You're overthinking it. Am I though?
[3789.90s -> 3809.46s]  I'm overthinking it. I don't, I'm not trying to overthink it. I'm just thinking in my brain,
[3809.46s -> 3819.18s]  it wants me to show the whole can, right? It wants me to show the whole can. I would need that,
[3819.18s -> 3850.79s]  this. Is that not what it wants me to do? Oh wait, what it wants this? Um, make it 71. I don't have
[3850.79s -> 3858.57s]  a 71 IQ. It's like, it was 121 when I took it. Um, like now it's been like 10 years, 15 years.
[3858.57s -> 3867.62s]  It was 124, went down to 121, which means it's definitely like 115 now, 110. I've, there's no
[3867.62s -> 3897.99s]  way I've gotten smarter. I've only gotten slower. Um, sorted by flavor. It's only one can. How would
[3897.99s -> 3911.46s]  you arrange this in your kitchen? I would be like, um, first of all, I'd say why, why the heck is
[3911.46s -> 3940.60s]  this not Bertoli? It's not one can. What? No, that can't be correct. I thought it was with all the
[3940.60s -> 3955.91s]  other stuff. What was with all the other things? Did I get Luigi'd? All right, so we got three.
[3955.91s -> 3972.34s]  Let's go over here. A lot and a lot. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Is it by the amount,
[3972.34s -> 3979.54s]  the level of the liquid? Because look, there's three, four, four. Three, four, four, five. One,
[3979.54s -> 3989.75s]  two, three, four, four, six. Right? Or should I do, do it by the level of the liquid? I'll try
[3989.75s -> 4027.06s]  level of liquid. All right. It's level of liquid. I, I was, I, why have this, that, whatever. There
[4027.06s -> 4058.90s]  it is. Oh, this one here. I didn't see this one. I didn't see that. Give it to me. It's right there.
[4059.38s -> 4106.41s]  Stack them. But what, I, what, I want to do it by length. Oh, nobody stacks spoons like that.
[4106.41s -> 4129.35s]  I got it. I got it. I get to do it from the top. Okay. So I'll just, here it is right there. Okay.
[4129.35s -> 4143.59s]  That's correct. This is not correct. That is not correct. That is also not correct. That might be
[4143.59s -> 4182.49s]  correct. And it is almost there. Not quite, quite, not quite, not quite. At least he's trying his
[4182.49s -> 4190.81s]  best. I don't know about you guys, but puzzle games like this, you're supposed to just kind
[4190.81s -> 4210.97s]  of hang out and do it. Nobody just goes, ding. Why didn't you do it faster? Okay. So this is
[4210.97s -> 4226.12s]  a bunch of sand into not a lot of sand. I don't think it matters. It doesn't matter what, what
[4226.12s -> 4317.62s]  side it starts. Speed run. Thank you. I figured that out really quick. It's not like this was in
[4317.62s -> 4341.26s]  the trailer on steam. There's more. I feel like the crumbs in the middle. No, I'll clean it up.
[4341.26s -> 4366.36s]  Right. Why, why is there my, what did I do? Minus two pinned by me? Why did I, what, I didn't
[4366.36s -> 4380.30s]  pin this. What do you mean pinned by me? I, when did I pin that? He found out. I did not pin this
[4380.30s -> 4400.89s]  message. I genuinely don't, I did not do that. How do I unpin this? Did one of the mods do that? I'm,
[4400.89s -> 4409.06s]  I'm being very serious. Did a mod do that? Or did I somehow accidentally do that? How did I do that?
[4409.06s -> 4428.92s]  I don't even see it. How would a mod do that? It says pinned by you. Oh my God. Okay. So that
[4428.92s -> 4436.30s]  was not supposed to be there. So let me explain what happened. I have three monitors and when I
[4436.30s -> 4447.18s]  move the chat, the chats, the chats, my chat window. Wow. You got to be kidding me. How long
[4447.18s -> 4455.56s]  is it there for? I'm not fucking around. I promise you this. When I, so I, anytime you hear the music
[4455.56s -> 4461.18s]  stop like this, it means I've clicked out of the window. So I probably clicked over cause the chat
[4461.18s -> 4465.82s]  is right up against the right side of the, of my left monitor, which is over here. This is where
[4465.82s -> 4476.22s]  you guys are. And the pin this message is right on the space that connects the monitors. So I must
[4476.22s -> 4480.06s]  have just put my mouse over, gone to the other monitor, clicked to get to the other monitor and
[4480.06s -> 4497.78s]  clicked pin a random message. And it was minus two. I, I, okay. I thought a mod did that. Whatever.
[4497.78s -> 4545.67s]  That's so funny. I can't, I don't know. Should that be that easy to do that? Hold on. I'm uh,
[4545.67s -> 4556.71s]  what's that? Oh, yeah. This is the, uh, this is the Xbox. Yeah. Let me just take that. One Xbox.
[4556.71s -> 4593.08s]  What? There's no other fruit. Where's the other fruit? All right. One of the workers was just
[4593.08s -> 4605.30s]  having fun. Excuse me, sir. What are you doing? I figured it'd be easier if I took all the price
[4605.30s -> 4614.78s]  tags off of every item and just went, I just, I just wanted to just get everything in the bag
[4614.78s -> 4622.17s]  and then scan everything. Sir. One of those is a TV. Yeah. I mean, I figured it would be easier.
[4622.17s -> 4653.86s]  Just get them all on one thing. All right. Do I throw these away? I do. Should I sort these by
[4653.86s -> 4715.94s]  my favorites? I think this is pretty accurate. This is from most favorite to least favorite.
[4715.94s -> 4781.48s]  Who cares? Just finish it. Chill. Somebody said, dude, you got to do it by the curl factor. Would
[4781.48s -> 4794.60s]  this be all the way over here then? I mean, this is technically a curl. These are the most, these
[4794.60s -> 4816.87s]  are super swirled. I don't know. Is that what they want? Or is it just by, then these would go first
[4816.87s -> 4843.94s]  then? No, they wouldn't. Is it, but is this a curl or is this a twist? You know what I mean? Yeah.
[4843.94s -> 4852.62s]  Okay. No, I had it right. I had it right. Give me one second. Give me one second. I'm not trying
[4852.62s -> 4944.81s]  to go for the world record. Line it up with the bird. I don't get this one. You have to line it
[4944.81s -> 4975.96s]  up with the background. The same image. Was that one as easy as I think it was? Stop. Get this cat
[4975.96s -> 4997.94s]  out of here. Stop. I don't want to, what do I do about the cat? Who uses a placemat? I don't. I sit
[4997.94s -> 5021.91s]  there and I eat it in my lap in front of the couch. Oh, in front of the couch? I don't know. I just
[5021.91s -> 5032.31s]  sit there like this and I eat in front of the couch. Yeah. You see, I sit on the TV. I put the
[5032.31s -> 5038.26s]  couch and I sit on this big square thing. It's called a television and I sit on top of it.
[5038.26s -> 5062.20s]  It's pretty comfortable and I watch the couch. You know, I can never do breakfast like this
[5062.20s -> 5070.60s]  for one reason. I'm kind of an all in or nothing kind of person. There would need to be two handfuls
[5070.60s -> 5078.20s]  of blueberries here in the egg. I don't like the, oh, just like three blueberries. Just give me,
[5078.20s -> 5087.40s]  give me two full handfuls of blueberries, like six strawberries in the egg. You know,
[5087.40s -> 5092.14s]  forget about the toast. Get the toast out of here. You know, maybe like one corner of the toast.
[5092.14s -> 5100.63s]  Give her the oranges and then way more of, way more of the fruits. Like another handful,
[5100.63s -> 5103.43s]  two handfuls of blueberries. By the way, there'd be two or three, there'd be three eggs here.
[5103.43s -> 5121.72s]  Probably two eggs, two eggs, handful of blueberries. Maybe not even, maybe like not even a strawberry.
[5121.72s -> 5127.90s]  I don't like heavy breakfasts either. I'm not a big, big, I like yogurt. Yogurt in the morning
[5127.90s -> 5139.03s]  is, I think it's just, just doesn't fill you up. Keeps you going. This dude eats blueberries and
[5139.03s -> 5150.10s]  eggs. All right. Where does this go? Do I have to make a shape with this or something? Why don't I
[5150.10s -> 5223.88s]  just do the funny thing? There it is. Here you go, kid. I wouldn't eat this. I feel like you were
[5223.88s -> 5291.11s]  trying to cast a spell on me. I can't move this one. It's okay. So it's got to go. Fuck out of
[5291.11s -> 5297.14s]  here. Leave now. Leave. No, actually stay. No, I mean like get out of here. You've been, you've
[5297.14s -> 5314.78s]  been in my brain. Fuck with me. Is it based on the river? It's definitely based on the water,
[5314.78s -> 5335.13s]  right? No, don't leave. Okay. So this is underwater. I'm going to imagine that's probably
[5335.13s -> 5344.65s]  like here. What does a river start? This is in the air. Is it air to up in the air to down on
[5344.65s -> 5475.66s]  the river to where the wolf is? You know what I'm saying? It has to be something like that.
[5475.66s -> 5483.96s]  How am I supposed to get it right? What's the, this is correct. But how do I, this is right.
[5483.96s -> 5496.07s]  But why, there's no dings. Like line them up in the better spot. That's correct. I mean,
[5496.07s -> 5525.13s]  it has to be, right? Yeah, this is definitely right. Or is this not right? How does the middle
[5525.13s -> 5562.36s]  connect? Uh, it does? Over here maybe? This feels like the logical place for this to go. Is this
[5562.36s -> 5576.09s]  wrong? It's not that right? Am I? Oh, I think it is. Shit. I think that is right. Isn't it?
[5576.09s -> 5606.50s]  But then how does this connect to something like that? This technically still needs to be down,
[5606.50s -> 5671.90s]  right? God damn it. Okay. I got it. This is it. Okay. I just had to move it around. Whoa. Okay.
[5671.90s -> 5766.09s]  Hold on. Is there anything else on this bottle? All right. There's something else on this bottle.
[5766.09s -> 5790.10s]  God damn it. All right. What's all the way in the back? This is not like that, right? Like this,
[5790.18s -> 5940.10s]  like that. Does it want me to connect these? No way. I don't get it. I don't understand.
[5940.10s -> 5981.75s]  Is the goal to make it one unit or just have them all connected to each other? I can
[5982.31s -> 5990.31s]  bring them to the front. Oh my goodness. Wait a minute. Okay. Hold on. This, everything changes
[5990.31s -> 6059.78s]  now. This is fucked. Mayo on the left. Here? Then where does this go? There's a worst stream.
[6059.78s -> 6065.38s]  You're not talking. Every stream I'm supposed to scream into the microphone as loud as I can.
[6065.38s -> 6106.14s]  Is that what you want me to do? Chill stream. Relax. I'm stumped. I actually don't. I actually
[6106.14s -> 6112.92s]  don't know what the hell to do. Somebody said, bro, close the fridge. You're just sitting there
[6112.92s -> 6120.46s]  like dragging the mayo, then the wine and the milk. Like, dude, you need to close the fridge
[6120.46s -> 6128.94s]  and you need to chill out. I get what it wants me to do, but I don't get what it wants me to do.
[6128.94s -> 6134.22s]  Does that make any sense? I have to do this like piece by piece. All right. Because it's like,
[6136.30s -> 6145.06s]  this is gray. This is gray, right at the bottom. This is gray, but this connects to the yellow
[6145.06s -> 6171.69s]  part here. Spread them out in a line. Okay. So this line lines up with this line, right? Yeah.
[6171.69s -> 6185.42s]  Okay. This line lines with this line, but it's the wrong color. Mayo goes on the left side.
[6185.42s -> 6204.33s]  I mean, like over here. So is this bait? This has to be like this, right? Or is this here just for
[6204.33s -> 6233.30s]  this? The milk goes behind the mayo like that. Then where does this go? Mayo. Holy shit. The
[6233.30s -> 6253.13s]  milk and the mayo. There are no overlaps. What do you mean that? How is that possible? No,
[6253.13s -> 6271.18s]  don't overlap. No overlapping. The patterns just connect. Where? You need to place them next to
[6271.18s -> 6273.98s]  one on top of each other where the patterns line up. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.
[6273.98s -> 6286.38s]  But like this pattern is not complete. You know what I mean? Right here, this pattern is not
[6286.38s -> 6302.81s]  complete and I don't know how to complete it like this. Wait, that doesn't make any sense though.
[6302.81s -> 6318.26s]  No, this is wrong. This is still wrong. I don't get it. I'm about to quit. I'm about to quit
[6318.26s -> 6373.99s]  and play a different game. What the fuck? No overlapping. Milk next to mayo. I don't understand.
[6373.99s -> 6382.18s]  Let's do a go play Super Mario Brothers. All right, here's what we're going to do. All you
[6382.18s -> 6388.73s]  brilliant chat players. I'm going to drag this and you tell me when to stop. No, that's not going to
[6388.73s -> 6401.90s]  help. Look at the shadows. What do you mean there's no shadows? Mayo. There are multiple
[6401.90s -> 6406.14s]  patterns that have to be lined up. You notice the milk into the wine. The mayo goes into the milk.
[6406.14s -> 6417.18s]  Yeah, but like some of these don't add up though. You know what I mean? Like is it just to be
[6417.18s -> 6426.78s]  touching? They just have to touch this? Like is it just aligning the squares and shit?
[6426.78s -> 6440.26s]  Is that that can't, that cannot be what it is. That, that actually cannot be what it is.
[6440.26s -> 6452.47s]  I, there's no way. No, this can't be. It actually can't be. I'm trying to like connect to everything
[6452.47s -> 6489.29s]  so it's a one lap. There's no way. It can't be. No, it actually can't be. Is that not it? I feel
[6489.29s -> 6499.06s]  like this is so close. This is not it. No overlapping, but it's, it is aesthetically
[6499.06s -> 6541.43s]  pleasing to me. What are you talking about? Why? You've got to be kidding me. There's no way.
[6541.43s -> 6546.07s]  It's just pattern. I thought it was like match everything and like connect all the dots and like
[6546.07s -> 6562.71s]  the colors all combined into one amalgamous image. I, no, you've got to be kidding me.
[6562.71s -> 6574.26s]  Way overthinking it. I thought it was going to turn into a different picture. Well, like connect
[6574.26s -> 6584.89s]  all the, why was all the squiggly lines there? They were just labels, bro. They were just labels.
[6584.89s -> 6592.68s]  They're not supposed to be anything. I'm connecting a big, but we, the first part of the game,
[6592.68s -> 6604.65s]  it had all the squiggly lines that you connected together. Let's see what happened here. Cat got
[6604.65s -> 6617.08s]  up on the shelf. Cat knocks over vase, breaks the vase. Person that's sitting on the couch just goes,
[6617.08s -> 6643.50s]  holy shit freaks out, knocks their wine over. Wait, that's not a vase? I feel like these pictures
[6643.74s -> 6661.34s]  aren't connected to each other. This seems the most accurate to me. Or is it like, oh, look,
[6661.34s -> 6671.10s]  the cat is kind of plotting. The cat's plotting. The cat touches stuff sometimes. And this time,
[6671.10s -> 6674.30s]  yeah, like sometimes the cat looks at stuff. Sometimes the cat touches stuff. The cat touched
[6674.30s -> 6722.58s]  this vase, smashed it. And then that happens somehow. Is it by color? All right. Without
[6722.58s -> 6738.63s]  overthinking it, what am I, what am I looking at here? Cat knocks that down. Cat knocks this
[6738.63s -> 6747.19s]  down. Cat breaks this. The cat is knocking all this stuff over. And this is just the cat looking
[6747.19s -> 6757.77s]  at an object. This is the cat starting to play with an object. So does it need to be in a weird
[6757.77s -> 6790.28s]  order? Or is this, is this it? Do I just have it? I know I had, I just did it in a weird, I think
[6790.28s -> 6830.70s]  this is where I'm going to move on to a different game. More squiggly line bullshit. I think they're
[6830.70s -> 6853.85s]  supposed to fit into each other. You know what I mean? Like fit into each other. What does this
[6853.85s -> 6872.54s]  one fit into? That? How blind are you? As every one of these puzzles has had squiggly lines, it's
[6872.54s -> 6911.18s]  had different colors, it's had different shapes. I mean, I have this, but what can connect to the,
[6911.18s -> 6951.02s]  this has to be the end, right? And nothing else can go there. What am I missing here? What am I
[6951.02s -> 6969.58s]  missing? I'm looking over at the mod chat and it's, everybody's doing this in the mod chat.
[6969.58s -> 6988.47s]  They're posting Soprano gifs. What are you guys talking about? What are you guys talking about
[6988.47s -> 7000.09s]  over here? Sorry. We're currently Soprano posting. Is somebody watching it? No, watch my stream.
[7000.89s -> 7026.90s]  Excuse me. Discussing an episode. All right, now you know it's time. I got to move on to a new game.
[7028.28s -> 7041.40s]  When the mods are discussing an episode of the Sopranos. That's actually fucking hilarious.
[7041.40s -> 7060.55s]  All right, so what's, what's going on here? This is so close yet so far. Wrong. This has to be in
[7060.55s -> 7067.75s]  between, right? What is happening? That's not correct. It has to be. What's wrong?
[7067.75s -> 7088.58s]  Wrong. Sponge has to go in the bucket. Sponge in between three and four.
[7097.85s -> 7111.54s]  Sponge what? Sponge red bottle. There's a nice rectangle there.
[7113.75s -> 7132.62s]  I would think we'd match up with the green. There's a rectangle gap. Move it up higher. I,
[7132.62s -> 7141.94s]  oh my god. I just accidentally did that. What kind of a sponge sits up like that?
[7161.53s -> 7165.53s]  Oh my god. This is going to be impossible. Get out of here. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[7165.53s -> 7181.27s]  Can I get out? I'm not going to be. This is impossible. Hold on. Hold on. Let me just get
[7181.27s -> 7303.74s]  them all in here. I actually like this one. That was, I love that one. That one was awesome. That
[7303.74s -> 7313.50s]  one was really fun too. Oh, I'm going to love this one. These, they get, they're getting better.
[7313.50s -> 7317.46s]  They're actually getting so much more fun. I can't wait to do this one. I'm not even kidding.
[7348.86s -> 7422.23s]  Yes. Now I just got to get it ready. Why is it doing that? Get in there. What do you mean?
[7422.23s -> 7449.53s]  Why can't these fit? And that is a perfect draw. This is perfect. What's wrong with this?
[7449.53s -> 7460.90s]  Does anybody else take all their clean silverware? Pick it all up in a gigantic tube in your hand.
[7460.90s -> 7472.10s]  Open up the silverware drawer and just drop it all in. No, I don't do that either.
[7472.10s -> 7481.43s]  I'm just trying to catch people that do. It's just magic's already opening up the drawer.
[7481.43s -> 7495.64s]  Just dump it. That would be such a mess. Stack them up. I can't turn them. I can't stack them.
[7495.64s -> 7504.86s]  It doesn't want, it won't let me turn it. They're just, oh wait, I get it. I thought it was supposed
[7504.86s -> 7537.83s]  to be inside. See these, these are going much smoother now. Oh dear. Oh dear. Actually,
[7537.83s -> 7569.27s]  this is not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Light bulb stream, light bulb tier list.
[7569.27s -> 7637.08s]  No, there we go. Hmm. Thank you. Oh dear. Oh, this one's going to be bad. I just got to focus.
[7638.04s -> 7647.53s]  The scissors have to go away. Getting the scissors in is a big deal. Get all the big
[7647.53s -> 7657.30s]  goofy objects in first. Like this is a big goofy object and it goes right here. Is that all right?
[7657.30s -> 7665.72s]  Any more big goofy objects? Yep. Pen has to go lengthwise. Okay. Yep. Big goofy object up here.
[7671.62s -> 7686.95s]  This also is lengthwise. It's going to go here. Big goofy pen. Hmm. What about this weird thing?
[7686.95s -> 7710.31s]  All right. Where does this go? Perfect. Glasses over here. Oh yeah. Actually, no, not quite.
[7710.31s -> 7765.05s]  This is not fit. Proprietary fondue fork, by the way. What is this shape? Something is oddly
[7765.05s -> 7792.68s]  shaped like this. What is it? What has that weird shape? Now it's a bunch of miscellaneous
[7792.68s -> 7838.10s]  bullshit. There you go. A bunch of miscellaneous shit can go in here. Okay. Wait, there's more.
[7838.10s -> 7889.91s]  Perfect. Not quite, but I'll fix it. That's fine. Whatever. It fits. It's fine. Almost done. There
[7889.91s -> 7979.72s]  it is. Shit. Give me the ding. I'll take a ding right now. What's wrong? Oh, all right. I got it.
[7979.72s -> 8032.52s]  This is fun. I like it when they just put things in boxes and not shit. What? How did I get it?
[8032.52s -> 8063.93s]  Got it. There's no orange. It was leaking from. Oh, okay. Oh, this is going to be a good one.
[8063.93s -> 8103.27s]  I don't know what to do. The big ones go in the middle, maybe? Like stack. Thank you. We got a
[8103.27s -> 8108.84s]  raid. Hey, Hazer. Thanks for the raid. Welcome. I don't know. Was that like a two hours ago?
[8108.84s -> 8113.88s]  Thanks for the raid, though. We've got a good stream. We're just chilling out today.
[8113.88s -> 8140.36s]  Let's hang out stream. One, two, three, four. I mean, this is five, but is that what they want
[8140.36s -> 8179.35s]  me to do? What do I need to stack them? Another raid song? Oh, no, I did it. I did it. It's one,
[8179.35s -> 8188.73s]  two, three. Yeah, I was thinking one, two, three, one, two, three, four. Well, that's not four.
[8188.73s -> 8203.11s]  This is one, two. This is a lot, isn't it? It's just by the holes, technically. Seven, one, two,
[8203.11s -> 8212.76s]  three, four. Yeah. So one, two, three, four, five. I wonder if I have to stack them. Oh, shit. Okay.
[8212.76s -> 8244.46s]  Hold on. One, two. It's technically three. Wait, are you sure I'm counting the wrong thing? It's
[8244.46s -> 8249.34s]  one, two, three, technically. One, two, three. Somebody said I was counting the wrong thing.
[8249.34s -> 8328.87s]  How do I get it to stand straight up? I think that this one's in the right spot, I think.
[8328.87s -> 8341.99s]  What does this one even tell me? Teeth at the end are numbers. Seven. Honestly, that would have taken
[8341.99s -> 8348.23s]  me a very long time because I'm sitting here counting how many prongs there are, not the
[8348.23s -> 8369.72s]  number it looks like. What is that, a five? So this is three, three, four, five, seven. Hold on.
[8369.72s -> 8382.18s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. What is this? One, two, three, six.
[8388.97s -> 8398.87s]  Six. I love how you ask a question and then swivel around in your chair waiting for the answer like
[8398.87s -> 8429.48s]  Dora the Explorer. Waiting for the answer. Is it six? It's six. Come on. These get tricky.
[8429.48s -> 8438.71s]  You gotta, come on, this must be a kill day. No, I'm good. I like, these are my favorite ones.
[8438.71s -> 8494.68s]  I love these ones. These are the best. Okay. I don't, this is not right. That's okay. Also not
[8494.68s -> 8526.02s]  right, but it's all right. Over here maybe. It's a weird shape. This shit is weird. Uh, wait a minute.
[8526.02s -> 8618.34s]  I think that's correct. Golden tooth? Wrong. Got it. What goes over here? How can you not see it?
[8618.34s -> 8709.58s]  Nothing's wrong over here. What's wrong? What's wrong? Yeah. What's, what's going on?
[8709.58s -> 8743.93s]  Bottom left? What's wrong with it? The nuts? Swap the bolts. Swap the fucking bolts. Swap the
[8743.93s -> 8756.94s]  fucking bolts. Oh my God. I'm like hyperventilating. Imagine looking at a draw of tools
[8756.94s -> 8764.65s]  and it's not even, I'm just sitting here going, I need to slow down. Swap. All right. Is it weird
[8764.65s -> 8773.32s]  that I don't know what a nut and a bolt is? You gotta call this what they look like. The little
[8773.32s -> 8780.07s]  spinny things that fall off the trees. Is that what you mean? The little spinny things that
[8780.07s -> 8790.66s]  fall off the tree. That's a wing nut. Okay. This is a bolt and you want me to move the bolts over
[8790.66s -> 8801.77s]  here? Bolt is like Frankenstein, right? These are Frankenstein bolts. What is it? Is it nuts? Is it
[8801.77s -> 8812.26s]  Frankenstein nuts? What do Frankenstein's nuts look like? I know. They look like this, right?
[8815.06s -> 8819.14s]  I know. As it was coming out, I knew what was happening, but like what do they look like?
[8820.02s -> 8829.77s]  They're like this, right? What? Just tell me what you want me to do. How does that sound?
[8829.77s -> 8846.57s]  Like this? I don't, guys, what is in bolt? What do you mean? Okay. Bottom left. You mean these
[8847.69s -> 8863.05s]  alternate the bolts. There's only one bolt. I did that already. What's this? What's the problem? I
[8863.05s -> 8876.34s]  did it already. I wasn't that already like that has to be fucking with us. Oh no, this is going
[8876.34s -> 8887.27s]  to be one of these where I have to make a picture. I'm addicted to this game now. I thought I was
[8887.27s -> 8917.29s]  going to give up. I like love it. Hold on. So the labels don't mean anything. What are you guys
[8917.29s -> 8928.97s]  putting a fish in here? Oh, I gave chat a fish to help them calm down. That scene was fucking crazy.
[8928.97s -> 8972.25s]  You guys think Tony? All right. I can't move this. Can this hang somewhere? I don't think
[8972.25s -> 9017.05s]  that's right. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, please do it. Jeremy, please do it. It's 2023. No one's angry.
[9017.05s -> 9025.19s]  Are you not angry? We're just hanging out. You can just chill out. No one's angry. Who's angry?
[9025.19s -> 9047.93s]  It's great. We're fuming. No, you're not. You're not angry. You're not actually angry. You're not.
[9048.01s -> 9072.94s]  I know you're not. What are we doing with all these Q-tips? Oh, I know what to do with the Q-tips.
[9072.94s -> 9088.66s]  You were gaslighting us. No, I wasn't. Why are these not going in? Who's angry? No, I'm not angry.
[9088.66s -> 9131.98s]  It's okay. Does this fit in here? I don't get it. I can't put it in. It doesn't go in here.
[9131.98s -> 9193.83s]  I don't understand what to do with the brush. Slow down and think. I would hang this on a little hook.
[9193.83s -> 9207.62s]  And what is this thing? Is this a flosser? Wouldn't it go in here? Can anything else fit in this?
[9207.62s -> 9219.24s]  Probably not, right? This brush doesn't go anywhere. Brush goes in your pocket.
[9233.54s -> 9311.77s]  But where does the floss go, then? Right there. I can't spin it, though. Yay. Oh, wait a minute.
[9311.77s -> 9366.82s]  I know. I got it. Oh, boy. This is going to be a challenge, but I'm up for it. No, please. God,
[9366.82s -> 9377.37s]  no. I don't think you guys have not entered the chill zone yet. You guys have not entered
[9377.37s -> 9383.03s]  the chill zone. I don't think I've ever heard of somebody chilling out and screaming,
[9383.03s -> 9392.82s]  oh, God, please, God, no. I don't see you chilling out and hanging out with the hot cocoa. Oh, God,
[9392.82s -> 9423.19s]  please, God, no. Wow, I'm so comfy. Oh, God, please, God. You need to relax. This game is too
[9423.19s -> 9432.36s]  stressful. No, it's not. This is a chill game. We're just chilling. All right, let's run a poll.
[9432.36s -> 9442.02s]  Mods, get a poll in the chat. Are you chilling out or oh, God, please, God? No. What does this
[9442.02s -> 9456.01s]  say? What did you make the title? The triangle block goes into the square. What? Sipping my,
[9456.01s -> 9468.86s]  I'm chilling out or oh, God, please, God? Yeah. It's not 70% of you that are freaking out. You
[9468.86s -> 9485.30s]  guys, we just, we're, we gotta chill. God, please, God. I just dropped the hammer. Are you guys
[9485.30s -> 9512.18s]  stressing out? Oh, my. Chilling. I'm stressing out. I'm confused. You're stressing them out.
[9512.18s -> 9527.61s]  This game gives me anxiety. I want to change my answer. You can't. Big dumb stuff first. Wait,
[9527.61s -> 9544.71s]  I can knock everything off. Okay, this has to hang between some. All right, I think that's
[9544.71s -> 9563.42s]  actually a good place for it. This definitely goes here. This might go right here. I'm so
[9563.42s -> 9597.91s]  chilled out right now. I just lost connection to chat. No, is that all right? Please, God.
[9604.02s -> 9610.34s]  You say that when you go on a really scary roller coaster. There's always somebody that's
[9610.34s -> 9615.16s]  for some reason, they decided to sit in the front seat. Like, don't sit in the front seat.
[9615.16s -> 9620.52s]  And they're like, oh, gosh, please, God, make sure we get through this. You don't, don't sit in the
[9620.52s -> 9643.51s]  front car. 60, 40. Yeah, but you gotta take, you gotta take like 20 to 30% away from the memers,
[9643.51s -> 9648.52s]  right? Yeah, I gotta take, you gotta take 20% of the way because they just clicked it because
[9648.52s -> 9691.98s]  they thought it was a funny sentence. Oh, okay. Hold on. How am I supposed to fit this? I was fine
[9691.98s -> 9764.01s]  until this level. I'm making progress. Don't act like I'm not making progress. Oh, God.
[9766.18s -> 9776.84s]  Don't do this to me. You just get up and go get a bowl of Captain Crunch and be fine.
[9782.44s -> 9814.78s]  Dude, I'm like tied to a chair. You just got me. I can't get out. Shit, this is so tricky.
[9814.78s -> 9861.06s]  I'm, how could I, this is so tricky. Fucking stop doing that. I'm, I, I, I, I, I'm, you know
[9861.06s -> 9887.82s]  what I mean? I'm getting there. A 10 year old could do this. Oh, stop it. Oh, they could not.
[9887.82s -> 9899.38s]  I'm close to wherever it is. That's where that goes for sure. It's so close. It really is. Don't
[9899.38s -> 9945.99s]  tell me it's not because it is. The broom go up here. All the, all the people that are doubters,
[9945.99s -> 9983.34s]  you're about to lose big time. Shut up. That's correct. Yes, it is.
[10034.82s -> 10039.34s]  He's never going to do this one. He's never going to do it. Should have done a poll.
[10039.34s -> 10045.62s]  Why did we not do a poll? Every single one of you just lost. We should have done a poll.
[10045.62s -> 10052.79s]  There's just a couple small things missing and it's good to go. It's just a few things missing
[10052.79s -> 10059.72s]  that are a little bit incorrect. It's, oh, it's, oh, it's there though. What do you change? Stop
[10059.72s -> 10066.34s]  changing my title. Dear Jerma, there are hints in the pause menu featuring the fishies within
[10066.34s -> 10090.60s]  that little face. Why are you communicating this way? Why are you communicating through titles?
[10090.60s -> 10097.94s]  There's something that's so close. Is it right here? Did I just get it? Oh yeah. I win. Where's
[10097.94s -> 10123.38s]  wait, something's missing. Where does this go? This one stupid thing, but I don't know. Something
[10123.38s -> 10156.44s]  has to change. Where's this broom go? Over here. I got it. Done. Hey doubters. Good night. Let's go.
[10156.44s -> 10183.29s]  What's wrong? It's the angle. No, this definitely goes here. Where else would that go? There. Okay.
[10183.29s -> 10214.14s]  There it is. Done. Yeah. See you later doubters. How would this be wrong? There's no way this is,
[10214.14s -> 10247.82s]  this is correct. Where else would any of this go? Doubters are winning. The wrench, the wrench needs
[10247.82s -> 10272.38s]  to be switched with something. There's no hole. That would make sense here. The yellow pick thing.
[10272.38s -> 10304.15s]  That is. See you later. All right. We got an easy cookies one. I don't even know what I just did.
[10304.15s -> 10338.44s]  It's betting time. Will I do this in 20 minutes? Will I get the ding in 20 minutes? Is that too
[10338.44s -> 10344.84s]  long or should I do 15? Too long. 15. Mod check. Why are you checking? Oh, it's because people
[10344.84s -> 10353.94s]  are doing the fish. 15 minutes or less? No, no way. 10. 10 is this. These games are designed for
[10353.94s -> 10366.46s]  you to play them for like 40 minutes. 15 minutes. Will I solve this in 15 minutes and put it in emote
[10366.46s -> 10384.87s]  only? Oh, you've been playing this for hours. Yeah. I'm having fun. I mean, contrary to maybe
[10384.87s -> 10389.83s]  some of your beliefs, this game is not the equivalent of me dunking my head in acid.
[10389.83s -> 10405.38s]  I'm having some... Wait, timer's going? No, it's not. It has to wait to wait till people bet.
[10405.38s -> 10412.73s]  No, timer's not going until it's... There's a lot of yeses. Is that a lot of yeses or a lot of noes?
[10412.73s -> 10429.77s]  That's a lot of yeses. A lot of you believe. Can we help with emote only? You can try. 30 million
[10429.77s -> 10448.98s]  versus 16 million. Well, a lot of believers. You ready? Tell me when to go. Mods are keeping
[10448.98s -> 10478.76s]  track right now. Economic collapse incoming. Okay. Wait, not yet. I want my own music. I want my own
[10478.76s -> 10495.82s]  music for this. I'm not going yet. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I'm not going yet. I need my own music.
[10495.82s -> 10503.38s]  I haven't looked. I want my own music. What should we do for our music? How about like... What am I
[10503.38s -> 10512.04s]  feeling? Something that's going to make me concentrate. Both headphones going in. Reset the
[10512.04s -> 10535.18s]  level. Okay. That's fair. I'm not looking. No, not Miku. The Bloodborne OST. Oh, the misery. I mean,
[10535.18s -> 10539.27s]  this is... That's going to get muted. Do you think I can do it in the time that we listen to, oh,
[10539.27s -> 10553.46s]  the misery? I'm just going to get muted. Is it worth it? What if it gets shut down? It's not
[10553.46s -> 10565.46s]  worth it. No, not doom. Something that's going to lock me in. The Flintstones? What on the karaoke
[10565.46s -> 10591.13s]  version? The karaoke version is just going to be... What? Hold on. Karaoke version. What does this
[10591.13s -> 10631.11s]  actually sound like? Put on the MIDI version? It's just... It's not... But is it just this?
[10631.75s -> 10657.58s]  This is... No, it's not. I need to sing it. If I sing this, will... Okay, will you guys be happy?
[10660.28s -> 10663.32s]  Should I just do this? Like, should I just fuck this game and I'm just going to do this for like a
[10663.32s -> 10676.14s]  minute? All right, I'll try. If I get through this, if I get through the first verse, I get another
[10676.14s -> 10694.81s]  two minutes. No, that's not fair. 15. All right, here we go. I'm going to try doing this. I don't
[10694.81s -> 10697.61s]  even know how it goes.
[10727.74s -> 10744.28s]  I even have the lyrics in front of me. The lyrics are in front of me and I still said it wrong.
[10744.28s -> 10750.73s]  You got to be fucking kidding me. I've said it wrong so many times that that's the right way.
[10754.02s -> 10763.42s]  Keep going. You just want to embarrass me even more in front of a hundred billion people? I have
[10763.42s -> 10766.07s]  to get at least the chorus and I'm done. I promise.
[10781.64s -> 10786.44s]  You, you're the great... They do that thing with their mouth.
[10786.44s -> 10795.10s]  But once you turn, they hate us. Oh, the misery.
[10796.06s -> 10805.13s]  Everybody wants to be my enemy. Spare the sympathy. Everybody wants to be my enemy.
[10805.29s -> 10824.78s]  They, they, they, they. Once you pray, oh the misery, every single laughter in the halls I stack it in
[10824.78s -> 10829.82s]  my mind and waiting for the time when I show you what it's like to be the world's Spirit of Mike.
[10830.70s -> 10840.95s]  Tell you you're the greatestest. But once you turn they hate us.
[10841.59s -> 10847.46s]  Oh the misery every single person is my
[10849.54s -> 10851.54s]  Spare the sympathy
[10852.26s -> 10854.86s]  Everybody wants to be my enemy
[10855.86s -> 10870.89s]  How does it actually go?
[10871.77s -> 10873.94s]  That is how it goes. Oh
[10884.94s -> 10887.38s]  That's it doesn't goes like ee-ee-ee-ee
[10887.94s -> 10903.25s]  Yeah, I fucked it up. What doesn't matter my version hurt. So my version hurt you. All right, let's go
[10903.25s -> 10916.27s]  Oh, wait, this must be a timer. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[10916.27s -> 10932.10s]  I needed to actual OST. I don't know. What should I put on this?
[10934.54s -> 10945.62s]  Restart, please. All right. I need I need songs. Hold on. How about like thinking music thinking music to inspire creativity
[10946.80s -> 10966.14s]  Positive thinking music for work and for studying. I think that sounds good. All right. All right, ready ready
[10966.50s -> 10974.23s]  Tell me when to go ready one two
[10975.19s -> 10998.95s]  Go
[10998.95s -> 11029.71s]  You all just got absolutely fucking annihilated
[11031.11s -> 11033.43s]  Annihilated so many people lost points
[11035.03s -> 11037.46s]  Wait, that's not it
[11039.78s -> 11042.47s]  Wait what
[11043.49s -> 11060.41s]  That's not is it the end. Oh, that was it. All right, I went you guys so some of you guys got absolutely annihilated
[11060.41s -> 11061.53s]  I'm so sorry
[11061.53s -> 11064.47s]  That was so easy
[11064.47s -> 11080.49s]  Here's another one. Here's your chance. Well, I solve this one in 15 minutes
[11088.13s -> 11097.01s]  That probably sounded so bad
[11097.01s -> 11104.95s]  15 is too long. What are you linking here?
[11114.81s -> 11120.26s]  Oh the misery every single person is my
[11122.34s -> 11124.34s]  Spare the sympathy
[11125.06s -> 11134.50s]  Everybody that is the I just did this while you're linking this to me. All right
[11134.50s -> 11139.38s]  A lot of you guys think yes, it's my people are gonna get fucking annihilated on this one
[11139.54s -> 11150.90s]  What if this one is super easy? I don't know. It's I don't I don't know what this is asking me to do
[11150.90s -> 11155.94s]  I'm just gonna go for it put on blood-borne. All right, I'll put on I'll put on
[11156.70s -> 11160.16s]  how about the
[11160.24s -> 11178.26s]  Ludwig theme that's like my favorite song. All right, this this is literally seven minutes. So it's got time
[11178.74s -> 11190.18s]  15 minutes is way too much time. All right, well then just bet accordingly then you need to bet accordingly
[11190.18s -> 11200.56s]  I'm not gonna tell you what you shouldn't shouldn't bet on. I'm just saying a bet. All right, are we ready?
[11205.74s -> 11214.38s]  Let's go for it. Okay in three
[11214.94s -> 11217.82s]  Two one go. Oh
[11230.27s -> 11240.54s]  That actually really hurt. Oh my fucking elbow my bleeding I
[11240.54s -> 11511.74s]  Just wanted to hear the breakdown hmm, this one looks easy
[11530.51s -> 11535.52s]  Hey, pretty good at that noise heard it 500 times. Oh
[11540.79s -> 11544.95s]  Pog he did the like thing where he goes like this and makes a noise that it like he's I
[11570.55s -> 11579.76s]  Actually don't think this one will be that bad. Wait a minute. Maybe it is. No, I don't think it'll be bad
[11579.76s -> 11581.48s]  I don't think you want to bet on this one
[11581.48s -> 11591.92s]  I don't think you should bet because this is really just finding with ease fit like for instance right here
[11592.72s -> 11598.66s]  Yeah, I don't think you should bet. Well, he's off in five minutes
[11601.34s -> 11607.43s]  Under five. Okay. I mean if you get up if you want to do it then go for it
[11607.43s -> 11636.74s]  But I'm telling you it's probably better do all in. Oh, no all in you suck. Is that what you said?
[11636.74s -> 11640.19s]  No, it's not. What did you say?
[11644.46s -> 11661.54s]  Oh, let him cook. I read that his you suck. How I don't think it's just moving pretty fast. All right. Are we good?
[11662.42s -> 11671.98s]  Ready to get started. I don't think I'm gonna do music for this one. So when I pick up the first piece
[11671.98s -> 11675.35s]  That's when you can start the timer. Maybe I'll do a little bit of music. Why not?
[11690.18s -> 11701.45s]  There's less than five minutes reset it. I just did didn't I? I just did how about um
[11702.25s -> 11714.74s]  Do penis music now too many people here too many people will leave the Elden Ring theme
[11717.11s -> 11729.83s]  Okay. Yeah, this is almost this is five minutes long. Here we go. Ready. This is the right one. Yeah, it is. Okay
[11729.83s -> 11737.03s]  Here we go. Ready three two one
[11739.60s -> 11918.40s]  I'm gonna pee I'll be right back
[11918.40s -> 11966.02s]  But why did I that was weird face? I just made he is so funny. Yeah, that's the wicked funny
[11966.02s -> 11987.63s]  We just did what am I grabbing here? There's the audio. Oh, okay. I follow in the footprints
[11987.63s -> 12013.67s]  I think so turn on music. I will in just a second. All right. This one looks a little tricky
[12013.95s -> 12018.66s]  This one actually looks pretty tricky. I'm not gonna look too much at it
[12018.66s -> 12020.06s]  I'm just gonna well now I can't do that
[12020.06s -> 12036.15s]  Are you guys done losing all your points or do you want to keep going more solve it within five minutes?
[12036.99s -> 12044.64s]  That's this a lot of you are gonna either make a lot of money or lose a lot of money in relative channel point terms
[12044.90s -> 12056.55s]  This is the start of this level. So I'm gonna start here and I am gonna make sure I'm focusing
[12061.11s -> 12091.53s]  It's not gonna be music. We're gonna do thunderstorm sounds to make sure I'm locked in I put 5k
[12094.57s -> 12111.26s]  13 million more than that 16 million. Yes 6 million say no as of right now five minutes
[12111.26s -> 12138.81s]  I don't know that one looked a little weird. Are we good? I'm gonna put both headphones in I'm gonna relax
[12140.14s -> 12141.60s]  thunderstorm
[12141.60s -> 12151.40s]  Sound effects because this will help ready three two
[12152.00s -> 12209.09s]  One start it's not it's not over
[12209.73s -> 12232.96s]  Stop doing that. Stop. I don't know what to do. I don't get it
[12235.18s -> 12284.54s]  Shit, okay. That one was very easy. I thought that was the lightning. Wait, wait, wait. Are we starting? Oh, we're starting
[12284.54s -> 12287.36s]  Okay, I alright
[12287.48s -> 12290.81s]  Rain's getting kind of wild out there
[12290.85s -> 12326.62s]  If this is this much going on, I would not be live. I would just I don't know I'd be like scared
[12336.34s -> 12353.58s]  Holy shit, dude. Turn your stream off. Just we'll see you tomorrow, man
[12354.00s -> 12388.03s]  We'll see you tomorrow. You don't have to do this. All right, we good. Are you good to go? All right
[12388.35s -> 12398.59s]  Let me reset it three two one go
[12453.10s -> 12479.67s]  Turn that off god damn it. I don't understand what it wants me to do
[12479.67s -> 12502.02s]  There's gotta be some kind of pattern to this like you can't you gotta take one and then from the opposite one maybe
[12509.26s -> 12559.50s]  Jesus, I don't understand. Oh one two, three, four five one, two, three, four one one
[12559.90s -> 12564.33s]  One one one two three one two one
[12564.37s -> 12578.79s]  One this is the only this one has one one this one also has one so daisy this one has one this one has
[12582.19s -> 12584.07s]  Maybe delete these
[12584.07s -> 12668.18s]  Did you I don't I haven't I haven't figured it out yet. I did something right there, though
[12668.38s -> 12677.30s]  Maybe every other one needs to be pulled. Maybe there has to be one on each trunk. I
[12678.62s -> 12714.89s]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't get it. I'm sorry everybody. I was up. What am I doing wrong?
[12714.93s -> 12755.69s]  What did I do wrong? I don't understand. I think it's a mirror mirror symmetry make it symmetrical. What do you mean?
[12755.69s -> 12776.74s]  Oh really shit. Okay. Wait, what that's symmetrical. This is not so this is symmetrical. This doesn't belong here
[12777.58s -> 12795.11s]  Understand it's just mirrored. This is mirrored except this shouldn't be here and down here. This is wrong
[12795.39s -> 12805.16s]  This can't be mirrored. The only way this can be mirrored is if I get rid of these all of these essentially, right this one
[12805.80s -> 12811.86s]  This one then
[12812.06s -> 12835.69s]  This it right. Okay, we didn't I didn't win reset it. Well, did I already cut one off that I wasn't supposed to
[12840.88s -> 12902.76s]  Okay. All right. This one was cool. I don't think that's right though
[12902.84s -> 12938.23s]  No, it is because they want me to do here the lines probably do another pole. No, no, no, no, no
[12938.23s -> 12981.97s]  No, don't ever overlap them. Isn't it a 33% chance that I just get this right eventually
[12982.29s -> 13033.85s]  Yeah, there's a 33% chance that I eventually will get this right gems. That's wrong with that
[13033.85s -> 13049.74s]  This looks pretty great to me do it by color. I'm trying to fit them together
[13050.14s -> 13176.27s]  Got it. I can stack these should I not do that? No, what I don't know to do. Hey
[13176.71s -> 13298.86s]  That's not it. I can't do symmetry with everything because I this one's
[13299.42s -> 13313.25s]  It's no counterpart. Oh the symmetry
[13313.93s -> 13342.95s]  These face in the wrong way. I think they were these are not in the right spot. I don't know why
[13343.51s -> 13393.51s]  mirror each side
[13393.51s -> 13400.86s]  Mean like what do you mean?
[13406.98s -> 13474.58s]  The only thing cooking is his brain I kind of don't get it seems like everything seems to be in order
[13474.82s -> 13486.35s]  Is everything not in order here? So you mean put one on like this?
[13486.35s -> 13492.71s]  You mean like I'm gonna show you demonstrations mean like this. I have one object on each side just mirrored
[13492.71s -> 13500.25s]  But what about this? I can't split these
[13552.45s -> 13654.60s]  I'm gonna turn off the lightning. Will you stop doing that? Which the red and the black that looks pretty good. What's going on here?
[13655.60s -> 13664.05s]  The cat is giving you hints. I think this looks good. I don't think there's anything wrong with this
[13664.77s -> 13729.54s]  Had it in the wood. Are you streaming from your private island?
[13732.89s -> 13742.55s]  Sounds are you filming?
[13749.67s -> 13753.54s]  private island Andy the black shell ah
[13754.86s -> 13787.82s]  What do you want? It's not helping. I don't know. It's my color. This does not help at all
[13787.82s -> 13795.57s]  I did have a hint and then some kid got a hold of this fucking book and just started just
[13795.85s -> 13836.12s]  Ruining it. Yeah, I'm doing that star has to go in the middle
[13836.64s -> 13863.40s]  There are pieces overlapping did it. Oh
[13872.80s -> 13874.96s]  dear dear me I
[14021.36s -> 14048.10s]  Think I'm almost done with it with these things you have to seriously sit back and just like kind of let your eyes just
[14048.46s -> 14071.78s]  Lose focus and just look at the whole thing whole sections, right? No put it back put it back put it
[14071.78s -> 14145.62s]  Oh, this is awful. Wait, they could have grown back. They could have grown back on its own. There's only like one more. Where is it?
[14176.47s -> 14187.62s]  I
[14187.62s -> 14190.54s]  Did not expect it to be like that. I thought I've had it
[14190.54s -> 14200.16s]  I thought I had it fine the sound effects are putting me to sleep. It was nice. Just use your eyes lol
[14200.16s -> 14219.47s]  Hey one, two, three, one, two, three one, two, three, four one, two, three, four down from here one, two, three
[14219.47s -> 14222.55s]  Four five down from here one, two, three, four five
[14223.07s -> 14294.55s]  Six wait, that's on there put it down. No, I don't know where it grew back. What am I missing now?
[14294.63s -> 14307.76s]  Two three four five down this one here. We got one three four five six seven eight nine one two
[14308.54s -> 14310.54s]  You piece of shit
[14310.90s -> 14345.90s]  Close it like it's over here somewhere. I feel like it's like right here. It definitely is where is it that?
[14349.35s -> 14357.27s]  Mirrors that mirrors this mirrors this mirrors that does that does that one does this one does not
[14358.19s -> 14366.02s]  Wait, no it does this one does this one does this one does this one does
[14366.82s -> 14369.26s]  This one this one this one does
[14369.94s -> 14376.30s]  It's under the cam
[14376.30s -> 14400.19s]  That's not
[14400.19s -> 14408.21s]  Reset I'm not gonna reset. Why would I reset? It's I'm almost I need one more
[14409.21s -> 14419.72s]  Reset what are you talking about? You're not being serious. I have to reset it. I know I don't I'm doing it
[14420.18s -> 14426.66s]  One two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven
[14427.18s -> 14429.86s]  One two, I messed it up. We can't find it
[14430.42s -> 14437.26s]  We can't find it. You pulled the wrong ones off
[14437.86s -> 14447.70s]  What you removed two of the same? Are you serious?
[14459.99s -> 14486.16s]  Seven I fucking don't remember where they are two three
[14486.80s -> 14513.86s]  four five
[14514.02s -> 14543.64s]  Six seven is one more. Yeah
[14544.24s -> 14557.52s]  All right. Very good. Thank you for the help. I wonder how much there is left in the game. Oh, this is easy
[14557.64s -> 14618.68s]  That was a good sound. Okay, what's happening here? These have eyes. I think I have to put stuff in the same
[14618.68s -> 14679.32s]  I don't know. How does this work rocks go together? What's with the gold? Oh, there we go. Nice
[14679.32s -> 14689.38s]  Let's see if I like this game. It's getting fun. I wish puts in music on I'll put the regular music on put it back on
[14689.46s -> 14715.50s]  Ooh, this is nice and you beat this game. I mean I have to assume I'm getting I wonder how many chapters there are
[14715.50s -> 14755.85s]  This is gonna be some mirror shit. I think so. It is another mirror only one of these. Oh shit
[14755.85s -> 14763.45s]  It's two of them egg. Hey
[14766.18s -> 14778.09s]  Hey, okay
[14778.09s -> 14821.02s]  Okay, what's the issue? You look like you've aged 15 years from playing this what no
[14821.02s -> 14837.96s]  I do not and how much cleaner does this need to be pretty good. You see do I do by color?
[14838.00s -> 14871.99s]  This one's not a mirror pinecones. Oh, right. No, these definitely go here
[14871.99s -> 14880.42s]  I think I have the top row done top row seems pretty good. Oh
[14890.60s -> 14904.27s]  Whoops. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Yeah, that was not good. That was bad. That was very bad
[14904.27s -> 14917.50s]  How does this one work actually?
[14918.06s -> 14924.13s]  demented
[14924.13s -> 14936.54s]  Demented I very clearly this one is based on they probably have to be touching the right colors
[14938.22s -> 14980.62s]  Like this. Mm-hmm. Stop doing that. I have it
[14980.62s -> 14982.62s]  I need to
[14984.82s -> 15048.13s]  That's not right you like that's pretty good
[15111.92s -> 15136.87s]  Is the neat the two colors need to this needs to be red green green
[15137.55s -> 15138.51s]  orange
[15138.51s -> 15150.42s]  Red green green orange orange black. That's not correct
[15150.74s -> 15161.04s]  Wait, then this is red green green orange orange black. There it is. I got it. I got it
[15162.04s -> 15187.74s]  If I have to fill this whole thing, this might be game over do I have to fill this whole thing actually
[15187.74s -> 15194.80s]  This might not be that terrible, but it might be one at a time
[15194.80s -> 15205.22s]  Yeah, just get the edges first and I'll be good corner get corner pieces. There we go. Okay
[15205.22s -> 15249.00s]  So there are the there's another corner down lower left Christ. I think it's top. Yeah, I think it's top, right?
[15249.04s -> 15271.91s]  Yeah, the green green goes on top right the Olympus you can fit. Yes comfy. I feel like blue has to go up here
[15272.01s -> 15320.29s]  Yeah, yeah, of course, of course. Damn. Oh, they don't okay. The colors don't matter. It's just what fits
[15320.37s -> 15369.13s]  I thought I had to be separated in different colors that changes everything. Okay, can all these even make anything in here?
[15369.13s -> 15372.68s]  They're gonna be enough. Oh
[15372.68s -> 15377.42s]  This actually doesn't help at all
[15377.50s -> 15407.18s]  Maybe someone's first chat message ever one message was this game fucking sucks first chat message first time out
[15409.58s -> 15418.63s]  That's got to be a record, right? And no it does not you are wrong
[15419.25s -> 15424.09s]  This game is actually very comfy and it's very fun and I enjoyed I've been playing it for like four hours
[15462.58s -> 15517.99s]  I quit I'm gonna play a homerun baseball game now. It was fun. I like this a lot
[15518.03s -> 15528.39s]  How many um, how many levels are here? What am I not even close? Oh
[15529.35s -> 15558.21s]  I was like, I've only done 2% of the game. Oh the misery every single person is my enemy spare the sympathy
[15561.65s -> 15574.78s]  You know how many people just like fucking click the X just like click move over here click X and
[15577.45s -> 15590.29s]  They realized they closed all their tabs and I just fucking ruin their night only
[15590.69s -> 15592.61s]  One two, three, four five six
[15592.61s -> 15597.01s]  It is enough levels to probably do another hour or two, but I want to play this baseball game
[15597.05s -> 15604.20s]  It's called I think it's called like super psycho baseball or something. It's like you have to hit a home runs and it's hard
[15604.42s -> 15617.05s]  I'll try it. That's good. Good. Good. Good. Yes. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. All right, let's do it
[15617.05s -> 15623.04s]  That was a little to the left. I give that a
[15625.40s -> 15633.50s]  Stamp that was fun recommended cozy. There's still a lot to do and I guess maybe this time
[15633.54s -> 15668.18s]  It's timed. All right. Hold on. Did I get more than one star on any level? What? Oh, you guys can't even see
[15668.42s -> 15689.70s]  Oops, sorry about that. The answer is no. There you go
