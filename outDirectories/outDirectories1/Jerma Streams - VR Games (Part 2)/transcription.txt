[0.95s -> 8.88s]  Oh, hello again, everybody. Let me just make sure the audio is working. Is it? It is. Would you look at that? It's beautiful.
[8.88s -> 25.02s]  Hey! Welcome to VR Day 2. We did VR Day 1 yesterday, and we're gonna keep going.
[25.02s -> 36.36s]  I've got some special treats for you. I'm gonna play Superhot VR first, and then after that, I got all the Beat Saber mods.
[36.36s -> 39.60s]  Sorry, this thing's like weighing my head down. I like this.
[39.60s -> 50.53s]  I got the Beat Saber mods, Superhot VR, and then pertaining to time, we're gonna see if I go back to budget cuts or not, and how I feel.
[50.53s -> 58.41s]  How do you feel? How are you doing today?
[58.41s -> 63.41s]  Superhot VR sounds crazy. It looks crazy, so I'm really looking forward to it.
[63.41s -> 75.63s]  Oh, my legs soar. My whole body is sore. I did like a five straight hour Zumba workout yesterday.
[75.63s -> 83.98s]  I haven't moved around that much in probably like five months. But let me tweet this out. I'll be here in two seconds.
[83.98s -> 157.70s]  Hey, we can get started. Okay, it's taking like 15 seconds. This tweet is still apparently sending the tweet.
[157.70s -> 171.33s]  I don't know how. It's like, oh, we're still sending .2k of data. What the hell are you talking about?
[171.33s -> 183.78s]  Is it there? Can you guys see my tweet? Oh, fuck, I just bumped it. I'm sorry. No, you can't.
[183.78s -> 193.78s]  Okay, well, let me try that again. That's odd.
[193.78s -> 220.59s]  All right, I'll be right back again. I literally cannot send a tweet. It will not let me do it.
[220.59s -> 234.78s]  Does Twitter have like, does it have server problems or something? What is this bullshit? Did I get banned?
[234.78s -> 238.78s]  Why would I get banned from Twitter? I write like, stream starting now.
[238.78s -> 245.89s]  Hey guys, sorry for the internet problem. Streams will happen tomorrow.
[245.89s -> 251.20s]  What do you guys think about Starbucks lids? Why would I get banned?
[251.20s -> 254.70s]  All right, well, fuck it. No tweet, apparently, because like Twitter sucks.
[254.70s -> 266.23s]  Banned for spam? I make a tweet like once every three days. Are you kidding me?
[266.23s -> 272.22s]  How many people do you guys follow that put a goddamn tweet up every 30 minutes?
[272.22s -> 285.71s]  But anyways, let's see how I look today. I came ready today. That's right.
[285.71s -> 291.85s]  Active wear. I got active gear on. This is like a breathable shirt.
[291.85s -> 302.34s]  What's with my autofocus? What is this piece of shit camera doing?
[302.34s -> 314.54s]  Oh, that's right. Every time my computer turns back on, all the autofocus settings are on default.
[314.54s -> 320.70s]  But we've been made a goddamn computer. Like, seriously.
[320.70s -> 326.52s]  It's better? All right, we're good.
[326.52s -> 330.14s]  All right, so we're going to play Superhot VR right now.
[330.14s -> 334.64s]  And by right now, I mean like right, like right now.
[334.64s -> 340.55s]  Let me just get in. I'm going to take one more sip of wine.
[340.55s -> 345.79s]  I also untangled the cord here. And boy, was that a pain in the ass.
[345.79s -> 356.50s]  Get this off. Okay, I got to like sign an agreement with Twitch.
[356.50s -> 358.50s]  Twitch with, what is that doing?
[358.50s -> 363.83s]  All right, I'm going in. See you guys soon.
[363.83s -> 366.78s]  Yeah, because you know, I'm not going to be able to see anybody.
[366.78s -> 368.78s]  I'm not going to be able to, I can't see what you guys are writing, you know?
[368.78s -> 370.78s]  That's like the worst part about it.
[370.78s -> 373.21s]  Let me just get my tools here.
[373.21s -> 376.51s]  The worst part about this is just not being able to, oh, what's that?
[376.51s -> 385.06s]  There you are. I fucking got at work in two.
[385.06s -> 387.30s]  All right, how do I say yes?
[387.30s -> 396.10s]  Okay, how do I play the game? Superhot.
[396.10s -> 401.82s]  Update. Why is it in a different language?
[401.82s -> 405.76s]  Your game. Yeah, I'm in it, right?
[405.76s -> 412.72s]  Yeah, I'm playing it, right?
[412.72s -> 416.79s]  Whoa! Ooh, that's painful.
[416.79s -> 420.66s]  That's so, that's so loud. Hold on.
[420.66s -> 423.66s]  No, it's not. It's face loud, you know what I mean?
[423.66s -> 427.15s]  It's really face loud. Just give me one second.
[427.15s -> 434.47s]  I'm just going to put on my fucking headphones.
[434.47s -> 438.95s]  All right, what do they want me to do?
[438.95s -> 448.54s]  Okay, going back in.
[448.54s -> 451.54s]  I got to stand like in the right, I got to make sure I'm in the right spot.
[451.54s -> 453.54s]  Wait, what was my latte?
[453.54s -> 463.57s]  What? I can't even drink out of this.
[463.57s -> 467.57s]  Fucking computers, but if it's not a computer, it's a material object.
[467.57s -> 488.05s]  This is all ice.
[488.05s -> 490.54s]  It's really heavy.
[490.54s -> 492.54s]  Like, there's a shitload of liquid in here.
[492.54s -> 497.22s]  Like, why can't I drink out of this?
[497.22s -> 502.42s]  Oh, that was a good latte.
[502.42s -> 504.42s]  All right, sounds good to me.
[504.42s -> 507.42s]  I just put a little too much ice in it because, you know,
[507.42s -> 509.42s]  you got to cool a latte down somehow.
[509.42s -> 510.42s]  You can't just not.
[510.42s -> 514.65s]  All right, what's the woman to do with the latte?
[514.65s -> 518.42s]  Thank God it shows your hands.
[518.42s -> 520.42s]  What are you guys saying about me?
[520.42s -> 527.08s]  Oh my God, you got to read.
[527.08s -> 531.18s]  It's hard for me to read.
[531.18s -> 536.18s]  It's a little, it's, well, all right, there we go.
[536.18s -> 537.18s]  I'm ready.
[537.18s -> 539.42s]  Grab gun.
[539.42s -> 548.98s]  I did it!
[548.98s -> 550.98s]  Time moves when you move.
[550.98s -> 552.98s]  Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
[552.98s -> 559.32s]  I completely forgot about this.
[559.32s -> 561.32s]  This game was, like, wild.
[561.32s -> 564.32s]  Super hot.
[564.32s -> 565.32s]  Did I even kill that guy?
[565.32s -> 567.32s]  Super hot.
[567.32s -> 573.42s]  Time moves when you move, right?
[573.42s -> 575.42s]  So, shouldn't this be moving?
[575.42s -> 577.88s]  Yes, that's right.
[577.88s -> 579.88s]  Yes, I'm your surgeon.
[579.88s -> 580.88s]  Just give me one moment here.
[580.88s -> 582.88s]  I've got to make one incision.
[582.88s -> 583.88s]  I'm 85.
[583.88s -> 584.88s]  I've been doing this for a long time.
[584.88s -> 585.88s]  Don't worry.
[585.88s -> 586.88s]  What do I do?
[586.88s -> 591.66s]  Why am I so small?
[591.66s -> 594.60s]  Shouldn't I be taller than this?
[594.60s -> 596.60s]  The lighthouses are not correct.
[596.60s -> 598.60s]  I should not be...
[598.60s -> 607.05s]  Can I not reach him?
[607.05s -> 610.82s]  Oh, okay.
[610.82s -> 631.24s]  Oh.
[631.24s -> 633.86s]  Last round.
[633.86s -> 636.32s]  Whose last round?
[636.32s -> 639.52s]  My last round?
[639.52s -> 644.32s]  What are they getting away from?
[644.32s -> 646.32s]  Right in the fucking head.
[646.32s -> 648.32s]  What are you guys saying?
[648.32s -> 651.32s]  Ooh, super hot.
[651.32s -> 653.33s]  Ooh, I missed.
[653.33s -> 656.81s]  You missed it.
[656.81s -> 657.81s]  Fuck him.
[657.81s -> 658.81s]  You know what I'm doing.
[658.81s -> 666.98s]  Super hot.
[666.98s -> 669.66s]  Super hot.
[669.66s -> 672.78s]  Super hot.
[672.78s -> 676.90s]  That's so cool.
[676.90s -> 678.90s]  What an interesting...
[678.90s -> 680.90s]  Now, thank you to VR Josh, by the way,
[680.90s -> 682.90s]  for telling me how to do that.
[682.90s -> 683.90s]  It was kind of hard.
[683.90s -> 685.90s]  With a big white background,
[685.90s -> 687.90s]  it's hard to see everything, but...
[687.90s -> 689.39s]  Turnable, look out.
[689.39s -> 692.39s]  There's someone else in the room.
[692.39s -> 706.01s]  He's going to shoot me, right?
[706.01s -> 708.82s]  Oh, that's so weird.
[708.82s -> 717.09s]  He's going to shoot me right in the head.
[717.09s -> 718.09s]  Imagine you had this.
[718.09s -> 719.09s]  He's going to shoot me right in the...
[719.09s -> 720.09s]  Can I grab the gun?
[720.09s -> 722.67s]  I missed.
[722.67s -> 725.54s]  Super hot.
[725.54s -> 729.12s]  Super hot.
[729.12s -> 730.12s]  This is...
[730.12s -> 731.12s]  Hey, how's the audio?
[731.12s -> 733.06s]  Is the audio good?
[733.06s -> 734.06s]  What do you guys think?
[734.06s -> 741.77s]  Yeah?
[741.77s -> 742.77s]  It's good?
[742.77s -> 749.73s]  Looks good?
[749.73s -> 754.74s]  Oh.
[754.74s -> 756.94s]  Thank you.
[756.94s -> 757.94s]  You can throw...
[757.94s -> 761.02s]  This is going to be so fun.
[761.02s -> 763.02s]  I can't wait to throw
[763.02s -> 767.11s]  glasses at somebody.
[767.11s -> 768.11s]  Straps.
[768.11s -> 769.11s]  Straps.
[769.11s -> 773.08s]  Straps.
[773.08s -> 774.08s]  It's easy to forget
[774.08s -> 776.08s]  because you get so immersed.
[776.08s -> 779.47s]  These are my hands.
[779.47s -> 784.63s]  It's easy to get immersed.
[784.63s -> 785.63s]  Okay.
[785.63s -> 789.37s]  We good?
[789.37s -> 790.37s]  We're good.
[790.37s -> 791.37s]  All right, let's go.
[791.37s -> 795.96s]  Hard catch.
[795.96s -> 796.96s]  How do I...
[796.96s -> 797.96s]  I should have probably
[797.96s -> 799.96s]  paid attention to how to throw it.
[799.96s -> 812.23s]  How do I let it go?
[812.23s -> 815.01s]  What?
[815.01s -> 817.27s]  There it is.
[817.27s -> 818.27s]  Okay.
[818.27s -> 823.80s]  All right.
[823.80s -> 824.80s]  Come on down here.
[824.80s -> 826.81s]  Oh.
[826.81s -> 829.26s]  Oh, shoot.
[829.26s -> 830.26s]  There it is.
[830.26s -> 831.26s]  Super hot.
[831.26s -> 832.26s]  Super hot.
[832.26s -> 833.26s]  Super hot.
[833.26s -> 834.82s]  Super hot.
[834.82s -> 835.82s]  Super hot.
[835.82s -> 836.82s]  Super hot.
[836.82s -> 838.06s]  Super hot.
[838.06s -> 839.06s]  That's so cool.
[839.06s -> 840.06s]  Yeah, I can go
[840.06s -> 841.06s]  a little fucking laughing at it.
[841.06s -> 842.56s]  Give it a try.
[842.56s -> 843.56s]  Give...
[843.56s -> 844.56s]  What am I getting?
[844.56s -> 847.21s]  Don't think so.
[847.21s -> 848.21s]  Whoa, another gun.
[848.21s -> 862.89s]  There's another gun there.
[862.89s -> 863.89s]  Oops.
[863.89s -> 864.89s]  No, I made it.
[864.89s -> 865.89s]  Damn it.
[865.89s -> 869.05s]  Oh, raise your hand.
[869.05s -> 871.06s]  Like this?
[871.06s -> 874.09s]  Is he going to pop it?
[874.09s -> 875.09s]  Oh, raise your hand.
[875.09s -> 876.97s]  Like this?
[876.97s -> 880.90s]  Is he going to punch?
[880.90s -> 892.25s]  I'm going to try.
[892.25s -> 894.00s]  What?
[894.00s -> 895.00s]  What did I do wrong?
[895.00s -> 896.00s]  What?
[896.00s -> 900.76s]  What did I do wrong?
[900.76s -> 903.15s]  What did I do?
[903.15s -> 904.15s]  Raise your hands.
[904.15s -> 905.15s]  Did I get hit?
[905.15s -> 907.42s]  Like, am I supposed
[907.42s -> 909.42s]  to just block a punch here?
[909.42s -> 910.42s]  Like, block.
[910.42s -> 911.42s]  Nobody behind me, right?
[911.42s -> 912.42s]  I think I got hit.
[912.42s -> 919.23s]  Yeah, I must have gotten hit
[919.23s -> 922.90s]  by somebody over here.
[922.90s -> 923.90s]  All right.
[923.90s -> 924.90s]  Light is canceled.
[924.90s -> 925.90s]  Whoa.
[925.90s -> 926.90s]  Oh, my face.
[926.90s -> 927.90s]  Why did I have to do that all the time?
[927.90s -> 928.90s]  Oh, my face.
[928.90s -> 929.90s]  Oh, my face.
[929.90s -> 937.93s]  Oh, my face.
[937.93s -> 943.97s]  Oh, my face.
[943.97s -> 944.97s]  Oh, my face.
[944.97s -> 949.79s]  Oh, my face.
[949.79s -> 950.79s]  Why did I have to do that
[950.79s -> 951.79s]  all over again?
[951.79s -> 955.27s]  Damn it.
[955.27s -> 957.09s]  Damn it.
[957.09s -> 967.80s]  Oh, this is so fun.
[967.80s -> 968.80s]  All right, I got it.
[968.80s -> 969.80s]  How close am I to the fucking wall?
[969.80s -> 977.81s]  Oh, fuck.
[977.81s -> 978.81s]  Get him.
[978.81s -> 987.86s]  Oh, give me the gun.
[987.86s -> 995.50s]  Oh, fucking crazy.
[995.50s -> 1024.98s]  This is insane.
[1024.98s -> 1025.98s]  Concrete security.
[1025.98s -> 1031.98s]  Got the gun in the back.
[1031.98s -> 1032.98s]  Calculator.
[1032.98s -> 1036.26s]  Where's the gun?
[1036.26s -> 1051.44s]  Time to pay.
[1051.44s -> 1052.44s]  The guy is going to act quick
[1052.44s -> 1056.30s]  and grab the gun first.
[1056.30s -> 1057.30s]  Where, why are you?
[1057.30s -> 1058.54s]  Super.
[1058.54s -> 1063.69s]  Halt.
[1063.69s -> 1064.69s]  Super.
[1064.69s -> 1065.69s]  Halt.
[1065.69s -> 1066.93s]  They come from all angles
[1066.93s -> 1068.49s]  and you turn around.
[1068.49s -> 1069.49s]  Oh, this is unbelievable.
[1069.49s -> 1070.49s]  Are you ready to play?
[1070.49s -> 1071.49s]  I think I am.
[1071.49s -> 1072.49s]  I hope I am.
[1072.49s -> 1073.49s]  Show your dedication.
[1073.49s -> 1078.18s]  This is sick.
[1078.18s -> 1079.18s]  It is.
[1079.18s -> 1080.18s]  It really is.
[1080.18s -> 1081.18s]  Show your dedication.
[1081.18s -> 1083.18s]  Aim for the head.
[1083.18s -> 1084.18s]  Okay?
[1084.18s -> 1089.38s]  Oh, I get it.
[1089.38s -> 1090.38s]  Oh, God.
[1090.38s -> 1091.75s]  I got like the floating tank.
[1091.75s -> 1092.75s]  Oh, I got like fingers.
[1092.75s -> 1094.57s]  What do you think about that?
[1094.57s -> 1095.57s]  No, there we go.
[1095.57s -> 1096.57s]  I can see you guys much better.
[1096.57s -> 1100.94s]  Oh.
[1100.94s -> 1112.81s]  There we go.
[1112.81s -> 1113.81s]  Beat.
[1113.81s -> 1115.18s]  Super hot disc beat.
[1115.18s -> 1116.18s]  What's in these games and discs?
[1116.18s -> 1117.18s]  I thought they were just bugs in my room.
[1117.18s -> 1127.31s]  Disc beat.
[1127.31s -> 1128.31s]  Where am I in my room?
[1128.31s -> 1129.31s]  Please put on your headset.
[1129.31s -> 1130.31s]  Oh, fuck.
[1130.31s -> 1137.57s]  Oh, fuck.
[1137.57s -> 1138.57s]  Oh, fuck.
[1138.57s -> 1139.57s]  Oh, fuck.
[1139.57s -> 1141.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[1141.58s -> 1142.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[1142.58s -> 1143.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[1143.58s -> 1144.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[1144.58s -> 1147.48s]  Oh, fuck.
[1147.48s -> 1148.48s]  Oh, fuck.
[1148.48s -> 1150.94s]  Oh, fuck.
[1150.94s -> 1152.88s]  Oh, fuck.
[1153.88s -> 1154.88s]  Please put on your headset.
[1154.88s -> 1155.88s]  It's on.
[1155.88s -> 1158.34s]  Oh, you mean like this thing.
[1158.34s -> 1159.34s]  Can I bring it down?
[1159.34s -> 1160.34s]  It's on.
[1160.34s -> 1161.70s]  How do I get it on?
[1161.70s -> 1163.90s]  I didn't.
[1163.90s -> 1171.80s]  What do we got?
[1171.80s -> 1172.80s]  How to the helicopter?
[1172.80s -> 1176.86s]  No.
[1176.86s -> 1178.54s]  All right.
[1178.54s -> 1179.54s]  Closing down.
[1179.54s -> 1180.72s]  Okay, I got two machine guns.
[1180.72s -> 1187.40s]  Let's get the dominations here.
[1187.40s -> 1188.40s]  Guy with the big gun.
[1188.40s -> 1189.40s]  Right.
[1189.40s -> 1190.40s]  Two left.
[1190.40s -> 1191.40s]  Got both guns.
[1191.40s -> 1192.40s]  We're going to go bang, bang, bang, bang.
[1192.40s -> 1193.40s]  Here we go.
[1193.40s -> 1194.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[1194.40s -> 1195.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[1195.40s -> 1196.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[1196.40s -> 1197.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[1197.40s -> 1198.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[1198.40s -> 1199.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[1199.40s -> 1200.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[1200.40s -> 1201.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[1201.40s -> 1202.40s]  Bang, bang, bang.
[1202.40s -> 1205.24s]  Here we go.
[1205.24s -> 1210.70s]  That didn't really work.
[1210.70s -> 1211.70s]  That's it, right?
[1211.70s -> 1225.55s]  Keep going.
[1225.55s -> 1226.55s]  Why?
[1226.55s -> 1227.55s]  No.
[1227.55s -> 1228.55s]  Oh.
[1228.55s -> 1229.55s]  All right.
[1229.55s -> 1237.77s]  He was right.
[1237.77s -> 1238.77s]  Damn, that was fucking nasty.
[1238.77s -> 1241.48s]  Nasty.
[1241.48s -> 1242.48s]  Give me this thing under here.
[1242.48s -> 1243.48s]  Oh, you're not going to rob this bank.
[1243.48s -> 1244.48s]  Emergency exit.
[1244.48s -> 1267.86s]  Just making sure no one was behind me.
[1267.86s -> 1272.18s]  Here we go.
[1272.18s -> 1273.18s]  I've got a place to hide.
[1273.18s -> 1274.18s]  Distract them.
[1274.18s -> 1275.18s]  Oh, fuck.
[1275.18s -> 1278.21s]  Oh, fuck.
[1278.21s -> 1283.74s]  Oh, fuck.
[1283.74s -> 1284.74s]  Oh, fuck.
[1284.74s -> 1286.30s]  Oh, fuck.
[1286.30s -> 1287.30s]  Oh, fuck.
[1288.30s -> 1289.30s]  I've got a place to hide.
[1289.30s -> 1290.30s]  Hi.
[1290.30s -> 1295.38s]  Distract them.
[1295.38s -> 1297.90s]  Here we go.
[1297.90s -> 1298.90s]  We're going to get...
[1298.90s -> 1299.90s]  They all have guns.
[1299.90s -> 1306.88s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[1306.88s -> 1308.31s]  This is fucking so fun.
[1308.31s -> 1309.31s]  Seriously.
[1309.31s -> 1310.31s]  Welcome back.
[1310.31s -> 1314.62s]  This is...
[1314.62s -> 1315.62s]  Oh, god.
[1315.62s -> 1316.62s]  I'm like a child.
[1316.62s -> 1323.18s]  Right here.
[1323.18s -> 1324.80s]  Bingo.
[1324.80s -> 1332.04s]  Right in the head.
[1332.04s -> 1333.04s]  Just in case.
[1333.04s -> 1334.04s]  No, I'm not going to get him with that one.
[1334.04s -> 1335.04s]  Let's get him with this one.
[1335.04s -> 1336.79s]  I dodged.
[1336.79s -> 1337.79s]  All right.
[1337.79s -> 1338.79s]  We'll get him with this one, motherfucker.
[1338.79s -> 1339.79s]  Right in the knee.
[1339.79s -> 1340.79s]  Oh, fuck.
[1340.79s -> 1341.79s]  Oh, fuck.
[1341.79s -> 1342.79s]  Oh, fuck.
[1342.79s -> 1343.79s]  Oh, fuck.
[1343.79s -> 1344.79s]  I'm going to get him with this one, motherfucker.
[1344.79s -> 1345.79s]  Right in the knee.
[1345.79s -> 1346.79s]  Oops.
[1346.79s -> 1352.45s]  It's all right.
[1352.45s -> 1353.45s]  We don't even need it.
[1353.45s -> 1355.14s]  Oh, my god.
[1355.14s -> 1356.14s]  He was right behind me.
[1356.14s -> 1357.14s]  Got that one.
[1357.14s -> 1365.61s]  Yay!
[1365.61s -> 1397.15s]  Okay, I've got playing Nerf fun time in the living room, mom.
[1397.15s -> 1406.56s]  My older brother's way better than me at Nerf.
[1406.56s -> 1423.03s]  What?
[1423.03s -> 1424.34s]  What?
[1424.34s -> 1427.62s]  What happened?
[1427.62s -> 1433.19s]  Right in the knee.
[1433.19s -> 1435.19s]  Oh, it worked.
[1435.19s -> 1445.70s]  Good.
[1445.70s -> 1446.70s]  All right.
[1446.70s -> 1449.66s]  What happened here?
[1449.66s -> 1450.66s]  Oh, yes.
[1450.66s -> 1463.55s]  I got it.
[1463.55s -> 1465.05s]  Holy shit.
[1465.05s -> 1466.35s]  Okay, hold on.
[1466.35s -> 1467.35s]  I've got to punch this guy.
[1467.35s -> 1468.35s]  The guy with the gun somewhere.
[1468.35s -> 1470.30s]  Right in the gut.
[1470.30s -> 1471.30s]  Right in the gut.
[1471.30s -> 1487.06s]  Watch that bullet.
[1487.06s -> 1488.06s]  I can see it.
[1488.06s -> 1492.18s]  Oh, come on.
[1492.18s -> 1493.18s]  Come on, man.
[1493.18s -> 1494.18s]  I don't even know where I am.
[1494.18s -> 1495.49s]  I need to fucking figure out where I am.
[1495.49s -> 1496.49s]  How did I fucking miss you all?
[1496.49s -> 1513.41s]  Who's left?
[1513.41s -> 1514.41s]  Where?
[1514.41s -> 1529.47s]  Got it.
[1529.47s -> 1530.47s]  Yes.
[1530.47s -> 1555.39s]  Same deal.
[1555.39s -> 1559.38s]  Bingo.
[1559.38s -> 1572.02s]  In his head.
[1572.02s -> 1573.94s]  I'm ready.
[1573.94s -> 1574.94s]  Okay, here we go.
[1574.94s -> 1576.57s]  Right there.
[1576.57s -> 1579.09s]  No.
[1579.09s -> 1580.26s]  Pick it up.
[1580.26s -> 1581.44s]  No.
[1581.44s -> 1584.86s]  God damn it.
[1584.86s -> 1586.99s]  Who's going to throw?
[1586.99s -> 1591.50s]  I got a bullet over here.
[1591.50s -> 1592.50s]  I'm dead.
[1592.50s -> 1593.50s]  Oh my god.
[1593.50s -> 1594.50s]  My goodness.
[1594.50s -> 1595.50s]  This is his fucking insanity.
[1595.50s -> 1607.10s]  Oh, he hit me right in the stomach.
[1607.10s -> 1610.33s]  Oh.
[1610.33s -> 1612.91s]  Oh, my god.
[1612.91s -> 1617.74s]  Oh, my god.
[1617.74s -> 1619.23s]  Oh, my god.
[1619.23s -> 1621.50s]  Oh, my god.
[1621.50s -> 1623.70s]  Oh, my god.
[1623.70s -> 1627.88s]  Oh, my god.
[1627.88s -> 1628.88s]  Oh, my god.
[1628.88s -> 1629.88s]  This is insane.
[1629.88s -> 1642.96s]  This is insane.
[1642.96s -> 1643.96s]  Oh, my god.
[1643.96s -> 1644.96s]  This is insane.
[1644.96s -> 1653.69s]  This is insane.
[1653.69s -> 1654.69s]  This is insane.
[1654.69s -> 1655.69s]  Insanity.
[1655.69s -> 1708.00s]  I didn't hit him in the stomach.
[1708.00s -> 1709.00s]  Fuck.
[1709.00s -> 1713.71s]  Are you kidding me?
[1713.71s -> 1722.05s]  You can block bullets with your gun.
[1722.05s -> 1756.30s]  Oh.
[1756.30s -> 1757.30s]  Come on.
[1757.30s -> 1765.51s]  Get him.
[1765.51s -> 1772.72s]  Oh, this one's fucking hard.
[1772.72s -> 1774.40s]  I'm losing it.
[1774.40s -> 1798.62s]  Alright.
[1798.62s -> 1816.66s]  Slow! Slow!
[1816.66s -> 1818.66s]  Oh, God!
[1823.78s -> 1825.78s]  Oh, look at him shaking!
[1829.58s -> 1832.14s]  That was fucking intense. That was great.
[1841.45s -> 1846.04s]  Bye-bye!
[1847.04s -> 1856.30s]  What comes up...
[1856.30s -> 1859.44s]  Oh, I didn't get them!
[1859.44s -> 1864.50s]  Man, I'm gonna use nothing.
[1864.50s -> 1866.50s]  You guys are working on your chest a little more.
[1866.50s -> 1868.50s]  That's what I'm talking about! It's fragile!
[1869.50s -> 1894.70s]  Make them pay.
[1894.70s -> 1895.70s]  Who shot the gun?
[1895.70s -> 1898.64s]  I heard a gunshot. I don't know where it came from.
[1898.64s -> 1905.10s]  Oh, my God.
[1909.03s -> 1931.84s]  Let loose!
[1931.84s -> 1934.85s]  I assume let loose means this.
[1935.85s -> 1952.30s]  Let loose! There it is.
[1952.30s -> 1954.30s]  Wait for it.
[1954.30s -> 1958.74s]  Do I have a gun?
[1958.74s -> 1960.18s]  I don't have a weapon.
[1960.18s -> 1969.61s]  I don't have a gun.
[1969.61s -> 1972.96s]  Chad, I don't have a gun.
[1972.96s -> 1988.97s]  What? Oh.
[1988.97s -> 1993.00s]  That was supposed to happen, okay?
[1994.00s -> 2001.23s]  Anything else change in the environment?
[2001.23s -> 2006.74s]  Alright, hold on. Where am I? I gotta be careful.
[2007.74s -> 2009.74s]  I gotta take a step over here.
[2010.74s -> 2012.74s]  Get it in there.
[2012.74s -> 2016.13s]  Do I have to put the helmet back on, too?
[2016.13s -> 2021.25s]  If I can fucking reach it, right?
[2022.25s -> 2025.81s]  This is gonna be fuel for so many fires
[2025.81s -> 2027.81s]  made out of gasoline on this channel.
[2027.81s -> 2030.30s]  I swear to God.
[2030.30s -> 2054.93s]  Come on.
[2054.93s -> 2056.93s]  I tried to block with my hands!
[2057.93s -> 2082.81s]  Get away from me, please.
[2082.81s -> 2085.81s]  Oh, whoa.
[2086.81s -> 2087.81s]  Oh.
[2087.81s -> 2088.81s]  Up top.
[2094.95s -> 2095.95s]  That's both, right?
[2095.95s -> 2098.52s]  Fuck.
[2098.52s -> 2099.52s]  Right in the head.
[2099.52s -> 2100.52s]  Right in the leg.
[2100.52s -> 2101.52s]  Yes.
[2166.81s -> 2171.10s]  Get out of my fucking life.
[2183.73s -> 2187.38s]  Oops, that only has two shots.
[2187.38s -> 2188.94s]  Okay, get ready.
[2188.94s -> 2191.20s]  Whew.
[2191.20s -> 2192.20s]  Special delivery.
[2192.20s -> 2193.20s]  Gun.
[2193.20s -> 2194.20s]  Axe.
[2194.20s -> 2204.50s]  That's so bad.
[2207.34s -> 2209.34s]  You know what? Come on over here.
[2209.34s -> 2210.34s]  Let's do this all day.
[2210.34s -> 2250.43s]  He's going for the balls.
[2250.43s -> 2252.43s]  He's gonna shoot me right in the nuts.
[2263.78s -> 2265.78s]  Oh.
[2265.78s -> 2273.06s]  Holy shit in my face.
[2274.06s -> 2305.40s]  I'm trying to catch a knife.
[2305.40s -> 2306.40s]  Beautiful. Let's go.
[2306.40s -> 2308.40s]  Give me that fucking thing.
[2308.40s -> 2310.60s]  I ain't even messing around anymore.
[2310.60s -> 2311.60s]  Let's go.
[2311.60s -> 2317.70s]  Here we go.
[2317.70s -> 2318.70s]  Bring it on. Let's go.
[2318.70s -> 2319.70s]  Fast.
[2319.70s -> 2328.99s]  To the wall.
[2328.99s -> 2329.99s]  Guys, am I gonna back into the wall?
[2329.99s -> 2330.99s]  I can't look at the thing.
[2330.99s -> 2338.18s]  Fucker.
[2350.05s -> 2351.22s]  Whoa, when you shoot.
[2351.22s -> 2352.22s]  Oh, I had it.
[2352.22s -> 2354.22s]  Fuck, when you shoot the gun right.
[2354.22s -> 2356.22s]  God damn it.
[2356.22s -> 2392.73s]  Oh, where am I?
[2392.73s -> 2394.93s]  Where is this?
[2394.93s -> 2397.19s]  Where is this?
[2397.19s -> 2398.69s]  I don't know where this is.
[2398.69s -> 2402.08s]  I'm running into something.
[2402.08s -> 2403.77s]  All right, I'm gonna do it.
[2403.77s -> 2404.77s]  Old-fashioned way.
[2404.77s -> 2417.78s]  Come on.
[2418.78s -> 2435.64s]  Where am I?
[2435.64s -> 2440.85s]  I didn't hit him.
[2440.85s -> 2441.85s]  I don't know how that happened, but it did.
[2441.85s -> 2461.46s]  Damn it.
[2461.46s -> 2462.46s]  What?
[2462.46s -> 2463.46s]  Oh, come on.
[2463.46s -> 2474.23s]  What, did it hit the wall?
[2474.23s -> 2475.23s]  God damn it.
[2475.23s -> 2491.64s]  I'm losing my...
[2491.64s -> 2502.74s]  I missed.
[2502.74s -> 2503.74s]  All right, slow down.
[2503.74s -> 2506.06s]  Slow down.
[2506.06s -> 2507.06s]  Slow down.
[2507.06s -> 2514.75s]  Slow down.
[2514.75s -> 2525.66s]  Slow down.
[2525.66s -> 2529.65s]  Okay.
[2529.65s -> 2535.88s]  Here we go.
[2535.88s -> 2538.88s]  I gotta grab the gun and then block the bullets, I think.
[2538.88s -> 2542.42s]  There's nothing else here.
[2542.42s -> 2543.42s]  Okay.
[2543.42s -> 2544.42s]  I just gotta dodge.
[2544.42s -> 2545.42s]  Why did he walk that way?
[2545.42s -> 2552.36s]  Okay.
[2552.36s -> 2553.36s]  Shh.
[2553.36s -> 2554.36s]  Oh no.
[2554.36s -> 2555.73s]  Oh no.
[2555.73s -> 2556.73s]  What is this?
[2556.73s -> 2574.03s]  What am I hitting?
[2574.03s -> 2575.03s]  Oh God!
[2575.03s -> 2583.76s]  It's just...
[2583.76s -> 2594.79s]  Super.
[2594.79s -> 2597.82s]  Super.
[2597.82s -> 2600.79s]  Super.
[2600.79s -> 2601.79s]  Halt.
[2601.79s -> 2603.48s]  Super.
[2603.48s -> 2604.72s]  Halt.
[2604.72s -> 2608.30s]  That was fucking wild.
[2608.30s -> 2611.99s]  I think I bumped into the lighthouse again.
[2612.99s -> 2617.23s]  It's so much worse when you're in your face in real life.
[2617.23s -> 2618.23s]  Bam.
[2618.23s -> 2628.29s]  Bam.
[2628.29s -> 2629.29s]  Just one.
[2629.29s -> 2633.54s]  There's a guy walking around here.
[2633.54s -> 2643.57s]  I don't see anybody else.
[2643.57s -> 2645.81s]  Oh, there he is.
[2645.81s -> 2650.46s]  Last words.
[2650.46s -> 2651.46s]  I don't see anything around me.
[2651.46s -> 2660.17s]  How am I gonna get out of this?
[2660.17s -> 2666.06s]  Oh, I did it.
[2666.06s -> 2683.78s]  Surprise, mother hacker.
[2683.78s -> 2684.78s]  Oh, over and out.
[2684.78s -> 2686.54s]  Couple people up top.
[2686.54s -> 2688.54s]  Let's go with the easy stuff first.
[2688.54s -> 2689.54s]  Bingo.
[2689.54s -> 2690.54s]  Head shot.
[2690.54s -> 2692.71s]  Head shot.
[2692.71s -> 2693.89s]  And then let's get one more head shot.
[2693.89s -> 2695.89s]  That's a good measure of this guy right here.
[2695.89s -> 2700.47s]  Why don't we make it a quadruple head shot.
[2700.47s -> 2702.47s]  I think that's what we're going for here.
[2702.47s -> 2714.14s]  Super.
[2714.14s -> 2715.51s]  Halt.
[2715.51s -> 2716.51s]  Almost at him.
[2716.51s -> 2717.51s]  Super.
[2717.51s -> 2718.51s]  Halt.
[2718.51s -> 2719.75s]  Super.
[2719.75s -> 2720.75s]  Triple head shot.
[2720.75s -> 2721.75s]  Alright.
[2721.75s -> 2728.43s]  Calling his shots.
[2728.43s -> 2729.43s]  That would have been great.
[2729.43s -> 2731.06s]  Okay.
[2731.06s -> 2732.30s]  What?
[2732.30s -> 2733.30s]  Dodge this.
[2733.30s -> 2743.24s]  I dodged it.
[2743.24s -> 2744.24s]  I did what you asked.
[2744.24s -> 2745.61s]  I did what you asked.
[2745.61s -> 2748.78s]  I think I'm getting close to the camera.
[2748.78s -> 2754.61s]  Is somebody behind me?
[2754.61s -> 2759.56s]  Alright.
[2759.56s -> 2761.38s]  Yep.
[2761.38s -> 2774.03s]  Take a peek.
[2774.03s -> 2775.03s]  You're in the way.
[2775.03s -> 2776.03s]  Here.
[2776.03s -> 2777.03s]  What?
[2777.03s -> 2778.03s]  Oh, I got him.
[2778.03s -> 2779.03s]  Okay.
[2779.03s -> 2780.03s]  Wrong door.
[2780.03s -> 2783.96s]  Oh.
[2783.96s -> 2785.96s]  Is somebody else gonna open the door?
[2785.96s -> 2786.96s]  Oops.
[2786.96s -> 2789.61s]  Come to me.
[2789.61s -> 2802.47s]  What are these days?
[2802.47s -> 2803.47s]  I'll get this right.
[2803.47s -> 2815.51s]  Get out of the way.
[2815.51s -> 2816.51s]  Butter hands.
[2816.51s -> 2820.12s]  Yep.
[2820.12s -> 2822.55s]  Crash the party.
[2823.92s -> 2831.15s]  What exploded in his head?
[2831.15s -> 2834.42s]  Did I shoot a bullet over there?
[2834.42s -> 2836.42s]  And hit him in the face?
[2836.42s -> 2838.42s]  I have no idea what's happening.
[2838.42s -> 2844.42s]  Show your commitment.
[2844.42s -> 2845.42s]  Look down.
[2845.42s -> 2849.38s]  Oh boy, this is actually pretty...
[2849.38s -> 2853.38s]  If you got a fear of heights, this is not a game that you'd want to be doing right now.
[2853.38s -> 2857.93s]  You gotta hand it over to a friend who goes...
[2857.93s -> 2859.93s]  I felt myself falling.
[2859.93s -> 2864.97s]  I can feel it.
[2864.97s -> 2866.46s]  Ugh.
[2866.46s -> 2867.46s]  Any more discs?
[2867.46s -> 2874.02s]  Don't do it.
[2874.02s -> 2875.02s]  Don't do it.
[2875.02s -> 2880.20s]  Can I unmute now?
[2880.20s -> 2881.20s]  What do you mean, unmute?
[2881.20s -> 2884.49s]  What are you talking about?
[2884.49s -> 2885.49s]  No.
[2885.49s -> 2890.61s]  Bodies are disposable.
[2890.61s -> 2896.75s]  Mind is software.
[2896.75s -> 2900.75s]  So, when I first heard this game, when they announced it, when they came out with it,
[2900.75s -> 2906.31s]  I thought this was just a VR mode for the original game.
[2906.31s -> 2910.31s]  I did not know that it was a completely made-from-the-ground-up VR experience.
[2910.31s -> 2913.31s]  And it's fantastic so far.
[2913.31s -> 2916.00s]  Don't worry, I got it.
[2916.00s -> 2919.70s]  Okay, so we got...
[2919.70s -> 2931.06s]  I can charge up my fists by holding.
[2931.06s -> 2933.06s]  So I have to grip.
[2933.06s -> 2941.22s]  I have to hold the grips down, too.
[2941.22s -> 2943.22s]  I have, like, laser hands.
[2943.22s -> 2954.03s]  Try again.
[2954.03s -> 2955.03s]  Can I only do that once?
[2955.03s -> 2957.91s]  I think I can only do that one time.
[2957.91s -> 2960.91s]  I should have done it on this guy.
[2960.91s -> 2964.18s]  It's all good.
[2964.18s -> 2965.18s]  Again.
[2965.18s -> 2973.86s]  Now, my, like, little kid powers aren't working.
[2973.86s -> 2975.86s]  My, like, imaginary powers.
[2975.86s -> 3007.30s]  Uh, kid, I don't think it's gonna work.
[3007.30s -> 3009.30s]  Come on, why is it not doing anything?
[3009.30s -> 3019.67s]  Am I missing something here?
[3019.67s -> 3020.67s]  Help me out here, what's going on?
[3020.67s -> 3026.29s]  Triggers and grips, yeah.
[3026.29s -> 3027.29s]  Triggers.
[3027.29s -> 3029.10s]  Grips.
[3029.10s -> 3030.10s]  Triggers.
[3030.10s -> 3031.10s]  Grips.
[3031.10s -> 3043.95s]  Have to get closer?
[3043.95s -> 3044.95s]  Triggers.
[3044.95s -> 3049.52s]  Grips.
[3049.52s -> 3051.52s]  I'm not sure I can get much closer than this.
[3051.52s -> 3053.89s]  I'm, like, out of the play zone right now.
[3053.89s -> 3062.27s]  Uh, maybe something screwed up?
[3062.27s -> 3066.29s]  Yeah, I'll help you here.
[3066.29s -> 3072.90s]  What?
[3072.90s -> 3074.85s]  Did I, like, chop?
[3074.85s -> 3076.85s]  What the fuck is going on right now?
[3076.85s -> 3078.85s]  Do I have to get shot in the hands?
[3078.85s -> 3094.14s]  You have to dab to activate.
[3101.53s -> 3105.20s]  Well, let's try again.
[3105.20s -> 3106.20s]  Mind blown.
[3109.36s -> 3110.54s]  Try again.
[3110.54s -> 3124.81s]  You can only do it once.
[3129.21s -> 3130.21s]  Okay, again.
[3130.21s -> 3139.98s]  Throw the gun forward and catch it.
[3139.98s -> 3142.66s]  Catch the bullets.
[3142.66s -> 3164.87s]  I can't, like, throw them.
[3164.87s -> 3170.18s]  I mean, it looks like I can do it, but I can't.
[3170.18s -> 3177.16s]  Is it getting baited?
[3177.16s -> 3201.70s]  Do I just have to...
[3201.70s -> 3203.70s]  I think I just have to dodge.
[3203.70s -> 3215.56s]  Because it...
[3215.56s -> 3217.93s]  I can't go, like, closer, I guess.
[3217.93s -> 3219.93s]  Like, I'll walk into the computer.
[3222.13s -> 3223.50s]  Okay.
[3223.50s -> 3230.86s]  Throw the gun forward.
[3230.86s -> 3238.92s]  Well, let's...
[3238.92s -> 3242.25s]  Did I actually get hit by that?
[3242.25s -> 3245.25s]  Why would I have known to throw the gun forward?
[3249.94s -> 3253.55s]  Come here, give me the gun.
[3253.55s -> 3258.31s]  Shoot it.
[3258.31s -> 3259.31s]  Go on, shoot me.
[3259.31s -> 3260.81s]  Shoot me.
[3260.81s -> 3261.81s]  Try it.
[3271.67s -> 3272.67s]  I mean, who...
[3272.67s -> 3276.04s]  Uh, this is the first time we've had an experience like this.
[3284.90s -> 3285.90s]  Did I miss?
[3285.90s -> 3288.33s]  God damn it, I fucking missed.
[3288.33s -> 3290.40s]  Wait.
[3290.40s -> 3291.40s]  Again?
[3291.40s -> 3293.96s]  What does it say?
[3295.90s -> 3297.90s]  What was the countdown for?
[3299.59s -> 3301.60s]  Shoot, hit me!
[3301.60s -> 3304.80s]  I'm right here, right in the face!
[3307.77s -> 3308.77s]  Alright, I get it.
[3308.77s -> 3315.00s]  Groundhog Day.
[3315.00s -> 3317.00s]  I don't even care anymore about dying.
[3318.43s -> 3331.36s]  I'm not even gonna shoot you.
[3331.36s -> 3338.53s]  I'm gonna take the gun and punch you in the face.
[3338.53s -> 3339.70s]  Yes, I am.
[3341.58s -> 3345.55s]  Oh, watch out for the fucking wall.
[3345.55s -> 3347.55s]  See, this is why I think hard to do this shit.
[3347.55s -> 3350.50s]  I need it in the other hand.
[3350.50s -> 3355.46s]  I can't aim with my fucking left hand.
[3355.46s -> 3359.33s]  That other one.
[3359.33s -> 3363.64s]  Shoulder.
[3363.64s -> 3364.82s]  Alright, good.
[3364.82s -> 3366.82s]  That's right, throw this gun like down the street!
[3366.82s -> 3378.94s]  Again?
[3378.94s -> 3380.75s]  Again?
[3380.75s -> 3382.12s]  Again?
[3382.12s -> 3384.68s]  You're almost ready.
[3384.68s -> 3386.11s]  Super.
[3386.11s -> 3387.42s]  Hot.
[3389.68s -> 3391.69s]  Oh.
[3391.69s -> 3392.69s]  Ooh, a nice hat.
[3392.69s -> 3396.02s]  Oh, no, it's a dog bowl.
[3396.02s -> 3400.20s]  Come on, let's go.
[3400.20s -> 3405.41s]  Give me the...
[3405.41s -> 3406.41s]  The hammer.
[3408.61s -> 3409.61s]  I wish I could keep the hammer.
[3409.61s -> 3410.61s]  Shoot them.
[3410.61s -> 3413.64s]  I don't think so.
[3417.38s -> 3418.38s]  Alright, fine.
[3424.29s -> 3426.59s]  Thought he was gonna move to his left.
[3428.34s -> 3432.27s]  Walk into it.
[3432.27s -> 3433.27s]  Ah, you didn't walk into it.
[3433.27s -> 3435.27s]  I'm trying to space invaders you motherfucker.
[3435.27s -> 3436.27s]  Let's go.
[3447.29s -> 3448.29s]  Holy fuck.
[3448.29s -> 3449.59s]  Now I got him.
[3449.59s -> 3461.56s]  I didn't think that would have been cool.
[3461.56s -> 3479.70s]  Fuck.
[3479.70s -> 3492.52s]  Give it to me.
[3492.52s -> 3496.05s]  Come on.
[3496.05s -> 3497.05s]  Okay, now where was I?
[3497.05s -> 3498.05s]  Where did I go?
[3498.05s -> 3501.14s]  Down there?
[3501.14s -> 3502.51s]  Shit!
[3502.51s -> 3513.24s]  Jesus Christ, did they go over the shotgun other one?
[3513.24s -> 3521.39s]  I turned skinny and didn't get hit by that.
[3521.39s -> 3527.90s]  I went so skinny, you have no idea how skinny I just got.
[3527.90s -> 3529.90s]  What about to go somewhere else?
[3529.90s -> 3530.90s]  Like that way?
[3530.90s -> 3531.90s]  Down in there?
[3531.90s -> 3538.13s]  I don't know where it's gonna put me.
[3538.13s -> 3541.31s]  It is in there.
[3541.31s -> 3542.31s]  Okay.
[3542.31s -> 3549.90s]  I don't even need to do that.
[3549.90s -> 3551.90s]  Come on, you stopped at the fucking exact moment.
[3551.90s -> 3562.68s]  Give me that.
[3562.68s -> 3563.68s]  Give me that.
[3563.68s -> 3564.68s]  Give me that.
[3564.68s -> 3565.92s]  Where am I?
[3565.92s -> 3566.92s]  Hello?
[3566.92s -> 3570.86s]  Alright, now I'm going up there.
[3570.86s -> 3572.49s]  Right?
[3572.49s -> 3577.26s]  We'll try two of them and see if I can get it.
[3577.26s -> 3586.23s]  Eh, not quite.
[3586.23s -> 3588.23s]  Jesus Christ, that was fucking fast.
[3588.23s -> 3606.32s]  Fucking fast.
[3606.32s -> 3627.55s]  That's not a gun.
[3627.55s -> 3636.22s]  Ah!
[3636.22s -> 3647.95s]  Damn it.
[3647.95s -> 3654.61s]  A stupid fucking wall.
[3654.61s -> 3656.61s]  It's like you have to move around so much.
[3656.61s -> 3662.61s]  I have like the minimum of what you're allowed to have to play VR at a room scale.
[3662.61s -> 3666.23s]  Locked in a goddamn box.
[3666.23s -> 3671.29s]  It's my own damn fault.
[3671.29s -> 3672.29s]  I wanted to be able to walk around in a circle.
[3672.29s -> 3676.29s]  I don't have like a fucking 1300 square foot living room.
[3676.29s -> 3684.82s]  I'm like trapped in a fucking ice cube tray.
[3684.82s -> 3687.14s]  Alright, I'm fucking, I gotta slow down.
[3687.14s -> 3693.35s]  I'm getting angry.
[3693.35s -> 3699.84s]  That didn't hit him?
[3699.84s -> 3709.53s]  Come on.
[3709.53s -> 3710.53s]  I didn't throw it.
[3710.53s -> 3730.39s]  Ah!
[3730.39s -> 3734.32s]  What?
[3734.32s -> 3736.32s]  How the fuck did I not hit him?
[3736.32s -> 3738.32s]  I don't even have the balls in this thing, but let's fucking play with it.
[3738.32s -> 3740.32s]  It's gone.
[3740.32s -> 3746.66s]  Okay, back where I was.
[3746.66s -> 3749.66s]  Let me get like situated so I can walk into a fucking wall.
[3749.66s -> 3757.10s]  Got it.
[3757.10s -> 3758.86s]  Butt.
[3758.86s -> 3760.54s]  Butt.
[3760.54s -> 3762.55s]  Um.
[3762.55s -> 3765.52s]  Okay.
[3765.52s -> 3766.52s]  That way, I think.
[3766.52s -> 3770.19s]  Right?
[3770.19s -> 3772.07s]  Doesn't matter.
[3772.07s -> 3778.92s]  It was that way.
[3778.92s -> 3788.76s]  That's a good wall.
[3788.76s -> 3794.20s]  Fuck, that's gonna hit me in the head.
[3794.20s -> 3795.20s]  Hit him!
[3795.20s -> 3806.98s]  I got him right in the fucking face.
[3806.98s -> 3814.74s]  Super.
[3814.74s -> 3815.74s]  Whew!
[3815.74s -> 3818.82s]  Super.
[3818.82s -> 3819.82s]  Wee!
[3819.82s -> 3840.16s]  Sure, I'll take him.
[3840.16s -> 3846.79s]  Oh man, that's coming for me.
[3846.79s -> 3854.86s]  Oh, that's wild.
[3854.86s -> 3857.49s]  What the fuck was that?
[3857.49s -> 3873.00s]  Okay.
[3873.00s -> 3875.00s]  One more guy.
[3875.00s -> 3877.46s]  Good?
[3877.46s -> 3878.46s]  Good.
[3878.46s -> 3892.97s]  Give me that gun.
[3892.97s -> 3893.97s]  Come to me.
[3893.97s -> 3894.97s]  Come to me, gun.
[3894.97s -> 3895.97s]  Come to me, gun.
[3895.97s -> 3896.97s]  Come to me, gun.
[3896.97s -> 3897.97s]  Come on.
[3897.97s -> 3898.97s]  Ugh.
[3898.97s -> 3900.97s]  I'm gonna fall over.
[3900.97s -> 3925.25s]  Super.
[3925.25s -> 3926.62s]  Hot.
[3926.62s -> 3928.11s]  Super.
[3928.11s -> 3929.35s]  Hot.
[3929.35s -> 3931.04s]  Super.
[3931.04s -> 3932.04s]  You what?
[3932.04s -> 3933.60s]  Hot.
[3933.60s -> 3934.90s]  Super.
[3934.90s -> 3935.90s]  Hot.
[3936.90s -> 3939.91s]  This is so fucking fun.
[3939.91s -> 3940.91s]  Ugh.
[3940.91s -> 3942.91s]  It is a workout though, I'll tell you.
[3942.91s -> 3944.91s]  In my little fucking ice cube box.
[3944.91s -> 3945.91s]  Hot.
[3945.91s -> 3949.75s]  I don't know where the wall is.
[3949.75s -> 3956.15s]  That's the fake wall.
[3956.15s -> 3958.15s]  Oh, we've got one guy here.
[3958.15s -> 3960.65s]  Right in his face.
[3960.65s -> 3961.65s]  Ike.
[3961.65s -> 3962.65s]  Okay, hold on.
[3962.65s -> 3963.65s]  Where?
[3963.65s -> 3964.65s]  I gotta be careful.
[3964.65s -> 3965.65s]  There's like swinging shit.
[3965.65s -> 3968.65s]  The walls are so wide I can't even see where the borders are.
[3968.65s -> 3974.55s]  For instance, what the hell happened here?
[3974.55s -> 3975.55s]  Where did I just go?
[3975.55s -> 3989.27s]  Got him.
[3989.27s -> 3992.18s]  Fuck.
[3992.18s -> 3999.79s]  I'm gonna fucking swing so hard down and it's gonna be bad.
[3999.79s -> 4001.79s]  I'm so self-conscious about it.
[4001.79s -> 4012.61s]  That was a double knife throw.
[4012.61s -> 4023.94s]  I liked it.
[4023.94s -> 4025.18s]  Okay.
[4025.18s -> 4026.18s]  Escape.
[4026.18s -> 4040.14s]  Oh.
[4040.14s -> 4041.14s]  What am I escaping to?
[4041.14s -> 4047.60s]  I don't understand.
[4047.60s -> 4058.59s]  Where am I going?
[4058.59s -> 4084.90s]  That's it.
[4084.90s -> 4085.90s]  Oh.
[4085.90s -> 4088.14s]  Got the knife.
[4088.14s -> 4090.38s]  And that's it, I think.
[4090.38s -> 4095.33s]  Super.
[4095.33s -> 4107.59s]  Oh, shit.
[4107.59s -> 4111.34s]  Shot the bullet out of the ear.
[4111.34s -> 4113.34s]  Prove your worth.
[4113.34s -> 4119.26s]  Breach the pyramid.
[4119.26s -> 4124.66s]  Obey.
[4124.66s -> 4127.66s]  This is one of those scenarios where I shouldn't have obeyed.
[4127.66s -> 4141.67s]  Did I do the wrong thing?
[4141.67s -> 4143.49s]  I don't know.
[4143.49s -> 4148.38s]  I may have.
[4148.38s -> 4150.92s]  Yeah, I'll get it.
[4150.92s -> 4152.92s]  This is the broken disk.
[4152.92s -> 4153.92s]  Alright, we got a shoe.
[4153.92s -> 4154.92s]  No, we don't.
[4154.92s -> 4162.82s]  We don't have a shoe.
[4162.82s -> 4165.18s]  Dance, dance, dance.
[4165.18s -> 4166.18s]  Oh.
[4166.18s -> 4173.76s]  Foo.
[4173.76s -> 4177.98s]  This is gonna be hard to do.
[4177.98s -> 4187.33s]  Has he shot yet?
[4187.33s -> 4222.86s]  Fuck.
[4222.86s -> 4225.86s]  I can't even get over there.
[4225.86s -> 4228.86s]  I'm just rolling around on the ground.
[4228.86s -> 4231.54s]  He's going for the ground shot.
[4231.54s -> 4251.70s]  What have I left in my legs?
[4251.70s -> 4252.70s]  Ah!
[4252.70s -> 4258.98s]  You fucking demon.
[4258.98s -> 4261.94s]  Get over here!
[4261.94s -> 4263.94s]  I just got shot right in the head immediately.
[4263.94s -> 4270.20s]  Oh, my mouth!
[4270.20s -> 4271.20s]  He shoots.
[4271.20s -> 4273.63s]  Dodge this way.
[4273.63s -> 4274.63s]  Punch him in the face.
[4274.63s -> 4276.63s]  Okay, he blocks like three shots for me.
[4276.63s -> 4279.90s]  I'm gonna stand in the corner over here.
[4279.90s -> 4280.90s]  I'm gonna hit something.
[4280.90s -> 4296.82s]  Let's move this way.
[4296.82s -> 4300.14s]  Okay, just gotta get it.
[4300.14s -> 4306.76s]  Ah!
[4306.76s -> 4309.51s]  Jesus Christ!
[4309.51s -> 4311.51s]  Ha ha ha ha!
[4311.51s -> 4326.54s]  Dodge this.
[4326.54s -> 4328.22s]  I dodged it.
[4328.22s -> 4347.43s]  I cue balled that guy.
[4347.43s -> 4348.43s]  No, no, no.
[4348.43s -> 4364.75s]  Don't use this yet.
[4364.75s -> 4367.57s]  Oh, yeah!
[4367.57s -> 4368.87s]  Kill it.
[4368.87s -> 4370.11s]  Scout scatter gun.
[4370.11s -> 4371.11s]  It really is.
[4371.11s -> 4372.11s]  You're right.
[4372.11s -> 4374.80s]  It kind of is the scout scatter gun, isn't it?
[4374.80s -> 4378.06s]  Alright, we got double knives.
[4378.06s -> 4380.06s]  Let's go for it.
[4380.06s -> 4381.06s]  Hello.
[4381.06s -> 4382.82s]  Hello.
[4382.82s -> 4385.62s]  Um.
[4385.62s -> 4392.36s]  Easy.
[4392.36s -> 4399.31s]  I fucked it up.
[4399.31s -> 4401.45s]  Ah!
[4401.45s -> 4403.45s]  Right in the face!
[4403.45s -> 4419.32s]  Alright, we getting away?
[4419.32s -> 4421.94s]  What if I do like the beam thing?
[4421.94s -> 4447.16s]  They gave me weapons everywhere.
[4447.16s -> 4453.62s]  Intercept.
[4453.62s -> 4455.62s]  I think I was supposed to do that.
[4455.62s -> 4463.80s]  One guy right there.
[4463.80s -> 4466.49s]  One guy over there.
[4466.49s -> 4474.41s]  Damn it.
[4474.41s -> 4479.27s]  Oh, I'm in fucking trouble, gad.
[4479.27s -> 4486.08s]  Oi!
[4486.08s -> 4507.01s]  Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai.
[4507.01s -> 4514.82s]  He's gonna be right behind me, isn't he?
[4514.82s -> 4522.20s]  Interfere.
[4522.20s -> 4531.16s]  Shit in my fucking face, dude.
[4531.16s -> 4533.16s]  No, no, no!
[4537.13s -> 4540.57s]  Super hot.
[4540.57s -> 4542.87s]  Super hot.
[4542.87s -> 4544.87s]  Intensity levels, I guess.
[4544.87s -> 4548.65s]  An 8 or a 9.
[4548.65s -> 4550.95s]  Meat cleaver time.
[4550.95s -> 4552.38s]  Where am I?
[4552.38s -> 4556.99s]  Okay, I think I'm in the right spot.
[4556.99s -> 4558.99s]  Gonna go across.
[4558.99s -> 4560.99s]  So down like this.
[4560.99s -> 4561.99s]  Down like that.
[4561.99s -> 4562.99s]  Grab the other one.
[4562.99s -> 4566.90s]  Grab his head.
[4566.90s -> 4568.90s]  Oh, there's a guy right there.
[4568.90s -> 4582.14s]  You know how cool that would've been?
[4582.14s -> 4615.30s]  I'm gonna fucking do that to me this time.
[4615.30s -> 4622.04s]  Bingo!
[4622.04s -> 4623.04s]  Oi!
[4623.04s -> 4625.22s]  Got cocky.
[4625.22s -> 4629.44s]  I got too cocky on that one.
[4629.44s -> 4630.44s]  I'm cocky.
[4630.44s -> 4631.44s]  It's alright.
[4631.44s -> 4637.03s]  Oh, what?
[4637.03s -> 4638.03s]  He's showing on the way over here.
[4638.03s -> 4639.03s]  Fuck you.
[4639.03s -> 4671.57s]  He's raining bullets.
[4671.57s -> 4676.97s]  One shot.
[4676.97s -> 4677.97s]  Get it.
[4677.97s -> 4681.24s]  Yes.
[4681.24s -> 4683.24s]  Alright, this one's done.
[4683.24s -> 4698.43s]  Holy fuck.
[4698.43s -> 4710.23s]  Alright.
[4710.23s -> 4713.25s]  Where am I at?
[4713.25s -> 4715.49s]  Get situated here.
[4715.49s -> 4731.55s]  Get the fuck outta here.
[4731.55s -> 4737.08s]  Survive.
[4737.08s -> 4749.30s]  No, I just have to put it down.
[4749.30s -> 4762.45s]  Wait, ai, ai, ai.
[4762.45s -> 4765.22s]  I need a gun.
[4765.22s -> 4771.58s]  None of those hit.
[4771.58s -> 4774.98s]  That's gonna get him right in the fucking face.
[4774.98s -> 4775.98s]  Drum roll.
[4775.98s -> 4779.97s]  Ah.
[4779.97s -> 4780.97s]  Super hot.
[4780.97s -> 4781.97s]  Wait.
[4781.97s -> 4782.97s]  Super hot.

[4788.82s -> 4789.82s]  Super hot.
[4789.82s -> 4790.82s]  Hot.
[4790.82s -> 4792.19s]  Super.
[4792.19s -> 4794.19s]  Tilt the camera so I can see you while you...
[4794.19s -> 4795.19s]  I can't...
[4795.19s -> 4796.19s]  Tilt the camera.
[4796.19s -> 4797.50s]  Hot.
[4797.50s -> 4798.50s]  Super hot.
[4798.50s -> 4799.50s]  I can't do that.
[4799.50s -> 4800.50s]  Like, in the middle of a game?
[4800.50s -> 4805.70s]  You can see me down here.
[4805.70s -> 4808.29s]  Ok.
[4808.29s -> 4810.46s]  Story the pyramid.
[4810.46s -> 4812.46s]  Story the pyramid.
[4812.46s -> 4816.07s]  You will be rewarded.
[4816.07s -> 4817.07s]  I'll give it a try.
[4817.07s -> 4818.07s]  Let's go.
[4818.07s -> 4827.44s]  Okay, what the fuck is going on? I don't like it with his looks.
[4827.44s -> 4839.60s]  Oh, it goes into my brain.
[4839.60s -> 4844.57s]  Alright, are we almost done I think?
[4844.57s -> 4866.12s]  Right in the hand.
[4866.12s -> 4868.42s]  That one stings.
[4868.42s -> 4909.15s]  I can't shoot with my fucking left hand.
[4909.15s -> 4911.15s]  Savaged it.
[4911.15s -> 4916.82s]  Oh fuck, I didn't see the guys over there. God damn it.
[4916.82s -> 4941.34s]  Going too fast. Come on, speed it up.
[4941.34s -> 4970.04s]  Oh!
[4970.04s -> 4972.04s]  Oh, the rush.
[4972.04s -> 4975.66s]  Going through my body. Fucking Jesus.
[4975.66s -> 4990.94s]  Just left one more, right?
[4990.94s -> 4999.33s]  Last Bastion.
[4999.33s -> 5002.33s]  I blew it. I blew it. I think I may have blew it. I blew it.
[5002.33s -> 5026.37s]  Nobody comes up behind you in this fucking game, right?
[5026.37s -> 5032.51s]  I thought it was blocking me.
[5032.51s -> 5037.29s]  Alright, honest to God, what the fuck is this bullshit?
[5037.29s -> 5061.44s]  Final order. Destroy the pyramid.
[5061.44s -> 5071.38s]  You are now free. What's wrong with you?
[5071.38s -> 5082.76s]  I don't get it. What do you mean?
[5082.76s -> 5099.42s]  It was perfect timing when that car drove by. You sounded really like a car.
[5099.42s -> 5111.13s]  Go out this way. You know what to do.
[5111.13s -> 5116.12s]  What do you mean I know what to do?
[5116.12s -> 5121.50s]  Destroy the computer. You're right.
[5121.50s -> 5125.50s]  Destroy VR. This is the thing about how VR is going to start to become too much like reality.
[5125.50s -> 5130.40s]  And people are going to get sucked in.
[5130.40s -> 5144.35s]  Super. Halt. Super. Halt. Super. Halt.
[5144.35s -> 5146.35s]  I think that's it. Or maybe not.
[5146.35s -> 5153.93s]  One of us. Mind is software.
[5153.93s -> 5155.93s]  Too cool to look. What is wrong with you?
[5155.93s -> 5157.93s]  It's high noon. Nice combo.
[5157.93s -> 5161.19s]  Oh, you are now free.
[5161.19s -> 5164.37s]  Prison Hunter. New experience. Savage.
[5164.37s -> 5167.55s]  Faster.
[5167.55s -> 5169.55s]  Don't die. What is this?
[5169.55s -> 5175.81s]  Oh, new discs.
[5175.81s -> 5181.85s]  What is this one?
[5181.85s -> 5183.85s]  This is don't die. There's a couple of them.
[5183.85s -> 5187.75s]  What is this? Is this just the game?
[5187.75s -> 5189.75s]  Oh, okay. I can pick.
[5189.75s -> 5194.25s]  Outer Heaven. Restaurant. Airplane. Pyramid. Yeah, you can just pick.
[5194.25s -> 5196.25s]  That's cool. How do I exit? Probably like this, right?
[5197.25s -> 5205.82s]  Yeah. Don't die. Headshot only. Hardcore. Speedrun. Real time.
[5205.82s -> 5207.82s]  Oh, yeah. Yikes.
[5207.82s -> 5210.12s]  What is don't die?
[5210.12s -> 5213.06s]  And then there's endless.
[5213.06s -> 5218.55s]  Give it a try.
[5218.55s -> 5232.76s]  Don't die.
[5232.76s -> 5234.76s]  So is this one of the levels? I don't get it.
[5234.76s -> 5244.49s]  Are we just going to go through the whole thing?
[5244.49s -> 5257.81s]  Super. Halt. Super. Halt.
[5257.81s -> 5259.81s]  Alright, I didn't die.
[5259.81s -> 5262.43s]  Halt.
[5262.43s -> 5264.43s]  Where's my money?
[5264.43s -> 5293.47s]  Break in.
[5293.47s -> 5295.97s]  Well, it was fun.
[5295.97s -> 5297.97s]  What about this?
[5297.97s -> 5304.62s]  I want to see how crazy this is.
[5304.62s -> 5306.62s]  Alright, this is real time.
[5306.62s -> 5308.62s]  There's no slowdown. It's just in real time.
[5308.62s -> 5310.62s]  I wonder how bad I'm going to be.
[5310.62s -> 5316.50s]  Let's just go to like...
[5316.50s -> 5323.60s]  Red.
[5323.60s -> 5326.86s]  Real time. I don't get it.
[5326.86s -> 5332.69s]  I don't understand. What's going on?
[5332.69s -> 5335.89s]  Oh, it's just time. It's just a speedrun.
[5335.89s -> 5339.15s]  Okay.
[5345.28s -> 5351.23s]  Knocked it up already.
[5359.55s -> 5370.88s]  Super. Halt.
[5370.88s -> 5372.88s]  32?
[5372.88s -> 5376.77s]  Super. Halt.
[5376.77s -> 5381.82s]  32 seconds.
[5381.82s -> 5386.74s]  I'm going to clean that up a little bit.
[5386.74s -> 5391.73s]  Alright, let me get out of here.
[5391.73s -> 5393.97s]  Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
[5393.97s -> 5395.97s]  Don't die. Headshot only. Hardcore. Speedrun.
[5395.97s -> 5397.97s]  Speedrun.
[5397.97s -> 5400.53s]  Game time.
[5400.53s -> 5402.53s]  Speedrun. Real time.
[5402.53s -> 5405.92s]  Okay.
[5405.92s -> 5408.99s]  Okay, I get it.
[5408.99s -> 5410.99s]  This is really, really cool.
[5410.99s -> 5412.99s]  But I'm going to get some water.
[5412.99s -> 5414.99s]  Because I've been in here for like, how long? An hour or two?
[5414.99s -> 5424.21s]  How long have I been in here for?
[5424.21s -> 5428.69s]  Five minutes.
[5428.69s -> 5434.30s]  Alright, let me get some water.
[5434.30s -> 5436.80s]  Uh-oh. Pulling hair.
[5436.80s -> 5438.80s]  Actually pulling hair out of my head.
[5438.80s -> 5442.13s]  Uh-oh. This is bad.
[5442.13s -> 5444.13s]  Oh, god damn it.
[5444.13s -> 5450.59s]  I just heard a snap.
[5450.59s -> 5452.59s]  You know, I was thinking about writing a novel.
[5452.59s -> 5457.89s]  Called The Bus Station.
[5457.89s -> 5460.70s]  Alright, give me a second.
[5460.70s -> 5469.60s]  Starbucks barista hair right now.
[5469.60s -> 5472.29s]  What would you like?
[5472.29s -> 5474.29s]  Was it a venti? Yeah, okay. I'll be right back with that.
[5474.29s -> 5482.02s]  Ugh.
[5482.02s -> 5484.02s]  Why are you so sweaty?
[5484.02s -> 5486.83s]  Well, you know, it's like, tough.
[5486.83s -> 5488.83s]  If you're like, a person making your food look like this, don't order there.
[5488.83s -> 5490.83s]  I would fucking leave.
[5490.83s -> 5492.83s]  I'd be like, you know what? I'll go to Dunkin' Donuts.
[5492.83s -> 5497.31s]  Hour and a half? Wow, I didn't think it was...
[5497.31s -> 5499.31s]  I thought it was shorter than that.
[5499.31s -> 5504.86s]  That was a blast.
[5504.86s -> 5507.55s]  I will be right back.
[5507.55s -> 5509.55s]  I'm going to get myself something to drink.
[5509.55s -> 5511.55s]  That was so sad.
[5511.55s -> 5514.18s]  That was so sad.
[5514.18s -> 5778.03s]  I'll be right back.
[5778.03s -> 5780.40s]  Okay.
[5780.40s -> 5782.40s]  So, uh, let's go
[5782.40s -> 5784.83s]  into Beat Saber.
[5784.83s -> 5787.90s]  Because I have
[5787.90s -> 5791.23s]  uh, I've installed
[5791.23s -> 5793.23s]  the mod, so let's hope it works.
[5793.23s -> 5795.92s]  And go get random songs.
[5795.92s -> 5805.46s]  Change it to Beat Saber.
[5805.46s -> 5814.61s]  So I should, there should be an option
[5814.61s -> 5817.10s]  in Beat Saber now.
[5817.10s -> 5822.35s]  Just get this back
[5822.35s -> 5827.22s]  to where it needs to be.
[5827.22s -> 5830.93s]  Let's get out of Super Hot.
[5830.93s -> 5841.17s]  And load up Beat Saber.
[5841.17s -> 5845.07s]  Okay, Beat Saber coming up.
[5845.07s -> 5847.07s]  Make sure I get you guys a good view.
[5847.07s -> 5850.34s]  I went outside looking in the mirror.
[5850.34s -> 5855.38s]  I'm like, red.
[5855.38s -> 5857.38s]  I'm as red as the shirt I'm wearing.
[5857.38s -> 5861.34s]  Full room VR.
[5861.34s -> 5863.34s]  My god, it's a workout. It's great though.
[5863.34s -> 5869.60s]  Alright, so
[5869.60s -> 5872.29s]  let's get back in.
[5872.29s -> 5874.29s]  Get you guys back in the right spot.
[5874.29s -> 5876.29s]  Let me just, cause once it's on
[5876.29s -> 5884.29s]  you can't really take it off.
[5884.29s -> 5888.58s]  Alright, now I should be able to go like this.
[5888.58s -> 5895.62s]  Hey, look at that.
[5895.62s -> 5903.17s]  Hi guys.
[5903.17s -> 5906.56s]  Okay, so I was in there
[5906.56s -> 5908.56s]  I was in this game for about 30 or 40 minutes yesterday.
[5908.56s -> 5911.06s]  There was like
[5911.06s -> 5914.00s]  8 dubstep songs.
[5914.00s -> 5916.00s]  So we're gonna try to find something new.
[5916.00s -> 5918.50s]  Uh, you guys maybe can help me out here
[5918.50s -> 5920.86s]  with how to do all this.
[5920.86s -> 5926.94s]  Uh, isn't
[5926.94s -> 5935.12s]  No, this is wrong.
[5935.12s -> 5937.42s]  This is the right hand, right?
[5937.42s -> 5939.42s]  Well, alright. I'm just gonna have to go like this
[5939.42s -> 5943.46s]  from time to time.
[5943.46s -> 5946.27s]  You guys are on another hand now.
[5946.27s -> 5949.41s]  Do the whole Shrek movie.
[5949.41s -> 5951.41s]  What do you mean, do the whole
[5951.41s -> 5955.25s]  Shrek movie?
[5955.25s -> 5958.06s]  Can you do that?
[5958.06s -> 5965.17s]  I can't do that.
[5965.17s -> 5967.17s]  Do the fucking whole Shrek movie?
[5967.17s -> 5970.24s]  You guys are gonna get me in
[5970.24s -> 5974.46s]  trouble. At least do Dancing Queen.
[5974.46s -> 5978.82s]  Yeah, you know what, you're right.
[5978.82s -> 5980.82s]  Okay, so, uh, mods.
[5980.82s -> 5982.82s]  More songs.
[5982.82s -> 5987.42s]  Take on me.
[5987.42s -> 5989.42s]  Oh, come on!
[5989.42s -> 5991.73s]  Yes, let's do it!
[5991.73s -> 5995.82s]  Wait, it doesn't have, it's only expert?
[5995.82s -> 5997.82s]  No, only expert.
[5997.82s -> 6015.30s]  I can't do this on hard?
[6015.30s -> 6052.72s]  Oh!
[6052.72s -> 6054.72s]  Who doesn't seem to go
[6054.72s -> 6056.72s]  on the shadow ways anyway?
[6056.72s -> 6059.28s]  Who does?
[6059.28s -> 6061.28s]  I can't do that while I do this!
[6061.28s -> 6075.87s]  I can't do this! I can't do that!
[6075.87s -> 6080.03s]  Expert plus only?
[6080.03s -> 6084.96s]  God damn it, I just wanna play it!
[6084.96s -> 6089.82s]  I don't wanna do expert plus?
[6089.82s -> 6096.35s]  Go back. Okay, let's beat it
[6096.35s -> 6098.35s]  from Michael Jackson. This is a classic.
[6098.35s -> 6102.00s]  Hopefully I don't get the
[6102.00s -> 6104.00s]  Twitch channel deleted. By the way,
[6104.00s -> 6106.18s]  uh, say goodbye
[6106.18s -> 6108.80s]  to the VOD. VOD ain't gonna
[6108.80s -> 6111.04s]  exist. Hope you will, hope you
[6111.04s -> 6113.04s]  enjoy this livestream,
[6113.04s -> 6115.04s]  cause that's what you're gonna get.
[6115.04s -> 6119.82s]  Alright, let's go. I'm gonna, I'm gonna
[6119.82s -> 6121.82s]  get into this and fucking get it. Perfect.
[6121.82s -> 6158.53s]  Alright, come on.
[6158.53s -> 6160.53s]  Uh, user has been banned for 72 hours.
[6160.53s -> 6163.47s]  Reason being,
[6163.47s -> 6165.47s]  DMCA claims
[6165.47s -> 6167.47s]  that Michael Jackson was staked.
[6167.47s -> 6210.46s]  Wow!
[6210.46s -> 6234.40s]  To jump over it?
[6234.40s -> 6279.70s]  Michael Jackson!
[6279.70s -> 6281.70s]  I can't stop hearing beat it now.
[6281.70s -> 6283.70s]  Beat. Beat for beat it.
[6283.70s -> 6290.86s]  This is
[6290.86s -> 6293.68s]  ridiculous. Alright, you know
[6293.68s -> 6295.68s]  this is just a way cooler guitar
[6295.68s -> 6300.16s]  hero. This is just a better
[6300.16s -> 6305.92s]  guitar hero. It just kinda is.
[6305.92s -> 6309.06s]  Alright, let's go back to
[6309.06s -> 6311.06s]  uh, let's go songs. More songs.
[6311.06s -> 6313.06s]  Let's get an interesting one. Wait, what?
[6313.06s -> 6317.33s]  Okay. Living on
[6317.33s -> 6319.76s]  a prayer.
[6319.76s -> 6321.76s]  Is every song on here?
[6321.76s -> 6323.76s]  I mean, that's a pretty good one.
[6323.76s -> 6331.36s]  Uh.
[6331.36s -> 6337.44s]  You know
[6337.44s -> 6339.44s]  I have to do this, right?
[6339.44s -> 6341.44s]  Okay. If I get
[6341.44s -> 6344.00s]  past the first
[6344.00s -> 6346.24s]  10 seconds,
[6346.24s -> 6354.37s]  then I win, okay?
[6354.37s -> 6386.18s]  10 seconds and I win.
[6386.18s -> 6388.18s]  I just gotta get past the first part.
[6388.18s -> 6390.18s]  Do it again. Fast the first part. That's it.
[6390.18s -> 6409.63s]  Only the first part.
[6409.63s -> 6480.22s]  I did it!
[6480.22s -> 6482.22s]  I'm done. I did it. I got it.
[6482.22s -> 6498.93s]  I did it. Okay.
[6498.93s -> 6502.06s]  Is this sort by? Sort by plays.
[6502.06s -> 6508.72s]  Attack on Titan?
[6508.72s -> 6511.28s]  What is this?
[6511.28s -> 6513.28s]  What is Attack on Titan?
[6513.28s -> 6515.28s]  Super Warrior Brothers theme? Let's go.
[6515.28s -> 6517.65s]  I'm gonna get Attack on Titan.
[6517.65s -> 6523.84s]  Uh.
[6523.84s -> 6525.84s]  I don't give a shit about anything else. Nothing else matters.
[6525.84s -> 6528.21s]  I don't care about fucking anything else.
[6528.21s -> 6533.39s]  Let's go. Best song ever made.
[6533.39s -> 6535.39s]  This is the best song that I've ever
[6535.39s -> 6537.39s]  heard in my whole life.
[6537.39s -> 6612.77s]  That was the other color. Yeah!
[6612.77s -> 6642.26s]  To the corridor.
[6642.26s -> 6657.04s]  Here it comes. Break it down.
[6657.04s -> 6676.48s]  Yeah! This is the
[6676.48s -> 6678.48s]  worst song I've ever heard in my
[6678.48s -> 6683.22s]  entire life. How do I
[6683.22s -> 6685.22s]  click that guy? Get rid of
[6685.22s -> 6689.63s]  him forever.
[6692.06s -> 6702.72s]  Right? Does this have a...
[6760.51s -> 6798.19s]  Look at me!
[6798.19s -> 6803.50s]  Random pattern.
[6803.50s -> 6807.15s]  Alright. What else did I get? Mario,
[6807.15s -> 6810.80s]  September. Did I get something else?
[6810.80s -> 6820.78s]  Oh.
[6820.78s -> 6831.28s]  Block that.
[6831.28s -> 6851.62s]  Okay. Alright. More songs.
[6851.62s -> 6857.82s]  He's a pirate.
[6857.82s -> 6860.26s]  You're welcome by
[6860.26s -> 6863.07s]  Moana.
[6865.07s -> 6869.81s]  The Skyrim theme.
[6869.81s -> 6871.81s]  Hey. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
[6871.81s -> 6878.27s]  The Imperial
[6878.27s -> 6880.27s]  March.
[6880.27s -> 6882.27s]  Star Wars. This is
[6882.27s -> 6884.83s]  easy. How about
[6884.83s -> 6886.83s]  Meme Mega Mashup? No.
[6886.83s -> 6900.98s]  I refuse.
[6900.98s -> 6902.98s]  I'm picking the worst fucking things.
[6902.98s -> 6911.73s]  Wait. Was that?
[6911.73s -> 6926.51s]  Alright. Let's do these.
[6926.51s -> 6929.20s]  What's going on?
[6929.20s -> 7032.03s]  Ding ding.
[7032.03s -> 7056.53s]  How long is this
[7056.53s -> 7058.53s]  song? Can it be over yet, please?
[7058.53s -> 7064.02s]  I don't want
[7064.02s -> 7066.02s]  people to come to the channel randomly and not know who I am.
[7066.02s -> 7068.02s]  I think this is cool. It is fucking
[7068.02s -> 7084.34s]  cool. Oh my god.
[7084.34s -> 7090.93s]  Give me a break. I want to be out of here.
[7096.05s -> 7100.34s]  Okay. Who cares?
[7100.34s -> 7104.56s]  Let's try this with an expert.
[7107.18s -> 7112.75s]  When I wake up
[7112.75s -> 7114.75s]  I don't want to be
[7114.75s -> 7116.75s]  I'm gonna be the
[7116.75s -> 7118.75s]  person next to you
[7118.75s -> 7126.10s]  And I'm gonna
[7126.10s -> 7130.24s]  Well, I know I'm gonna be
[7130.24s -> 7132.24s]  the man who gets stuck next to you
[7132.24s -> 7134.24s]  And if I ever
[7134.24s -> 7136.24s]  Yeah, I know I'm gonna be
[7136.24s -> 7138.54s]  I'm gonna be the man
[7138.54s -> 7140.54s]  Slippering to you
[7140.54s -> 7143.87s]  But I will get miles
[7143.87s -> 7150.14s]  And I will do
[7150.14s -> 7152.38s]  One thousand miles
[7152.38s -> 7154.38s]  Then I'll follow that
[7154.38s -> 7156.38s]  It's like walking. You're walking.
[7156.38s -> 7163.42s]  This game sucks.
[7163.42s -> 7168.42s]  No. I'm just kidding. It's great.
[7168.42s -> 7175.52s]  How about that?
[7175.52s -> 7191.57s]  I
[7191.57s -> 7202.64s]  I can't. It hurts my head.
[7202.64s -> 7204.64s]  Gerudo Valley
[7204.64s -> 7207.07s]  Evangelion
[7207.07s -> 7211.74s]  How many zones are on here?
[7211.74s -> 7213.74s]  Toxicity is on here.
[7213.74s -> 7227.10s]  Do dare. The Force.
[7227.10s -> 7229.10s]  That's a remix. Me channel theme.
[7229.10s -> 7234.29s]  Okay. The Pokemon
[7234.29s -> 7236.29s]  theme. No, no, no, no, no.
[7236.29s -> 7249.34s]  We're going too far here.
[7249.34s -> 7263.81s]  I can do the whole thing. They go like
[7263.81s -> 7269.89s]  Hey, hey.
[7269.89s -> 7339.44s]  Oh, I can't wait
[7339.44s -> 7341.44s]  till they do their fucking reunion tour.
[7341.44s -> 7343.44s]  I'm gonna be in the front row.
[7343.44s -> 7359.50s]  They're coming to Vegas real soon.
[7359.50s -> 7364.24s]  Sing along. I want to see it.
[7364.24s -> 7415.70s]  Be your fool
[7415.70s -> 7418.06s]  In this game for you
[7418.06s -> 7420.37s]  So I'm leaving
[7420.37s -> 7422.37s]  you behind
[7422.37s -> 7436.26s]  Hey!
[7436.26s -> 7467.54s]  I'm here. Beat.
[7467.54s -> 7480.85s]  Is this a remix?
[7480.85s -> 7485.71s]  Is it gonna be a remix?
[7485.71s -> 7491.02s]  This is hard. It's probably gonna be like
[7491.02s -> 7493.02s]  Oh yeah.
[7493.02s -> 7522.45s]  How would you
[7522.45s -> 7533.58s]  It's not a remix?
[7533.58s -> 7550.42s]  The song is perfect
[7550.42s -> 7552.42s]  as it is. I thought it was gonna
[7552.42s -> 7554.42s]  do like a huge drop. Alright.
[7554.42s -> 7557.55s]  This is coming up.
[7557.55s -> 7560.62s]  This one's coming up.
[7560.62s -> 7563.82s]  This one's coming up.
[7563.82s -> 7619.62s]  This is a lot of bombs.
[7619.62s -> 7621.62s]  Hey!
[7621.62s -> 7682.72s]  Dude!
[7682.72s -> 7713.49s]  Play Germacrap.
[7713.49s -> 7719.06s]  This is like, it's just
[7719.06s -> 7721.06s]  the whole thing, right?
[7721.06s -> 7726.94s]  Oh god.
[7726.94s -> 7728.94s]  Well, I'm in the game. I might as well
[7728.94s -> 7730.94s]  just do it, right? How long is it?
[7736.96s -> 7739.20s]  This is not easy!
[7757.41s -> 7759.41s]  Okay.
[7774.83s -> 7776.83s]  Okay. Germacrap.
[7792.56s -> 7796.98s]  I can't
[7799.66s -> 7801.66s]  I can't
[7828.58s -> 7831.58s]  I can't feel it.
[7840.43s -> 7842.43s]  I actually have to crouch.
[7866.13s -> 7868.43s]  I missed!
[7882.67s -> 7885.87s]  This is how we do it.
[7904.38s -> 7906.38s]  I've only done Minecraft like
[7906.38s -> 7908.38s]  three times in my life!
[7927.58s -> 7929.58s]  I'm so stupid!
[7929.58s -> 7931.58s]  See? This is why
[7931.58s -> 7933.58s]  I'm in it, you guys. You see?
[7933.58s -> 7936.51s]  Why would I think it would?
[7936.51s -> 7938.51s]  And I just jumped off of it.
[7938.51s -> 7941.14s]  Okay. Remember this.
[7941.14s -> 7943.14s]  Where are we? 20 East? I have no idea.
[7943.14s -> 7947.02s]  Fuck!
[7947.02s -> 7949.02s]  We gotta get trees.
[7949.02s -> 7953.57s]  First thing you gotta get. I'm getting
[7953.57s -> 7956.38s]  stamina! I'm losing stamina.
[7956.38s -> 7962.70s]  Hopefully you guys are
[7962.70s -> 7964.70s]  playing video games.
[7964.70s -> 7969.38s]  Nobody got it. Who cares?
[7969.38s -> 7971.38s]  If somebody got like a drink!
[7981.20s -> 7983.20s]  It's not easy!
[7990.67s -> 7993.23s]  It's not easy!
[8012.83s -> 8014.83s]  Oh my fucking god!
[8014.83s -> 8017.52s]  I can do it on no fail mode?
[8017.52s -> 8019.52s]  No, I don't even want to do that.
[8019.52s -> 8026.30s]  It's like 19 minutes long.
[8028.30s -> 8030.30s]  This is gonna be fucking hard too. God damn it.
[8030.30s -> 8032.30s]  I'm scared. This is an expert.
[8032.30s -> 8034.30s]  Not mislabeled as easy.
[8036.30s -> 8154.56s]  Not going too bad.
[8154.56s -> 8156.99s]  Let's see! That's a good song.
[8156.99s -> 8162.03s]  Search.
[8162.03s -> 8164.03s]  Do the rat song. Do the rat song.
[8164.03s -> 8168.05s]  Play your dang what?
[8168.05s -> 8170.05s]  Rats rats rats. Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[8170.05s -> 8182.66s]  I mean there's two of them.
[8182.66s -> 8184.66s]  We'll get the original and then we'll get both.
[8184.66s -> 8187.86s]  I'm not gonna be able to do that. I'm an expert.
[8209.01s -> 8213.15s]  Alright, let's go.
[8227.55s -> 8230.18s]  Oh!
[8232.18s -> 8234.18s]  What the fuck? I said that the whole thing.
[8234.18s -> 8239.30s]  Do it again.
[8257.70s -> 8259.70s]  Better than I ha- Let's just see.
[8259.70s -> 8261.70s]  Let's see how it goes.
[8261.70s -> 8265.14s]  Here comes the sequel.
[8285.04s -> 8287.34s]  There it is.
[8287.34s -> 8297.01s]  There are the two rat songs.
[8297.01s -> 8299.01s]  But how the fuck am I supposed to do this?
[8299.01s -> 8308.54s]  Is this just a dance number?
[8308.54s -> 8319.10s]  I think it's a dance number.
[8358.45s -> 8381.81s]  It's a jackass right now.
[8381.81s -> 8387.70s]  You can't not look like a
[8387.70s -> 8389.70s]  jackass when you're in VR 363.
[8389.70s -> 8429.38s]  That's what I'm gonna do for that one.
[8429.38s -> 8444.98s]  That's right. Here's my favorite part.
[8444.98s -> 8487.26s]  Okay, better not get rid of Vincent Price's part.
[8487.26s -> 8489.26s]  Here it comes, here it comes.
[8489.26s -> 8507.31s]  Here it comes, here it comes. I don't care about it.
[8507.31s -> 8509.94s]  Just do it.
[8509.94s -> 8531.63s]  Here it comes.
[8531.63s -> 8535.78s]  No, what? You don't cut Vincent Price off.
[8535.78s -> 8537.78s]  What the hell was that?
[8537.78s -> 8542.37s]  I can't believe it.
[8542.37s -> 8544.54s]  I don't know.
[8544.54s -> 8550.82s]  Doom basket case.
[8550.82s -> 8556.90s]  Doom OST.
[8556.90s -> 8560.22s]  Somebody just gave $50.
[8560.22s -> 8563.55s]  Who was it?
[8563.55s -> 8567.65s]  It just rocketed up the screen.
[8567.65s -> 8569.65s]  That's what that was. Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[8569.65s -> 8572.53s]  That's a huge fucking money drop.
[8572.53s -> 8575.02s]  Let me see if I can see it.
[8575.02s -> 8577.02s]  I can't see it. I have to come out of the whole thing to see it.
[8577.02s -> 8580.29s]  Take two steps to your right.
[8580.29s -> 8587.44s]  Better?
[8587.44s -> 8589.44s]  Take two steps to your...
[8589.44s -> 8593.09s]  But the thing tells me to stand here.
[8593.09s -> 8595.09s]  Save. Why was I like over here?
[8595.09s -> 8597.84s]  I was like over here.
[8597.84s -> 8599.84s]  Rule of thirds, guys.
[8599.84s -> 8601.84s]  Rule of thirds.
[8601.84s -> 8609.46s]  Alright, this is good. I put it right here, right?
[8609.46s -> 8614.06s]  Alright, I got a couple more. What were they?
[8614.06s -> 8616.30s]  I'm the giant rat
[8616.30s -> 8618.30s]  that makes all of the
[8618.30s -> 8620.30s]  rules.
[8620.30s -> 8622.30s]  Let's see what kind of troll we can get ourselves.
[8622.30s -> 8628.64s]  Alright.
[8628.64s -> 8633.82s]  Any requests?
[8633.82s -> 8638.88s]  Basket case?
[8638.88s -> 8660.18s]  Is that even on here?
[8660.18s -> 8662.35s]  How about American Idiot?
[8662.35s -> 8664.35s]  How about Wake Me Up When September Ends?
[8664.35s -> 8666.78s]  What is this one?
[8666.78s -> 8669.09s]  Which one is this one?
[8669.09s -> 8671.09s]  I don't even know which one this one is, but I'm going to do it.
[8671.09s -> 8674.16s]  I need to hear it first.
[8674.16s -> 8677.49s]  This one?
[8677.49s -> 8679.49s]  There it is.
[8679.49s -> 8684.72s]  This song is definitely
[8684.72s -> 8686.72s]  about me.
[8686.72s -> 8727.74s]  This song is about me.
[8727.74s -> 8729.74s]  My shadow
[8729.74s -> 8731.74s]  The only one that walks beside me
[8733.74s -> 8786.14s]  Eek!
[8800.86s -> 8802.86s]  I'm bringing up My Shadow.
[8802.86s -> 8804.86s]  It's everybody's favorite part. It's the only part of the song that everyone knows how to sing.
[8873.23s -> 8875.23s]  When the city sleeps
[8875.23s -> 8877.23s]  and I'm the only one
[8877.23s -> 8880.43s]  that walks beside me
[8880.43s -> 8882.43s]  My shadow's the only one
[8882.43s -> 8884.43s]  that walks beside me
[8884.43s -> 8886.43s]  Today is
[8886.43s -> 8888.43s]  only way
[8888.43s -> 8890.43s]  to go around and find me
[8890.43s -> 8892.43s]  My shadow
[8892.43s -> 8894.43s]  and find me
[8894.43s -> 8896.43s]  Okay, stop it!
[8896.43s -> 8947.50s]  One more time?
[8947.50s -> 8949.50s]  One more time?
[8949.50s -> 8952.06s]  We have a resident
[8952.06s -> 8954.75s]  sleeper.
[8954.75s -> 8956.75s]  It's boring as fuck.
[8956.75s -> 8962.70s]  Alright, fine. We'll do
[8962.70s -> 8964.70s]  a meme song. What do you guys want for a meme
[8964.70s -> 8972.77s]  song?
[8972.77s -> 8974.77s]  Brass Butin was on the list. I saw that
[8974.77s -> 8984.05s]  a shitload of times. Is that actually on here?
[8984.05s -> 8986.05s]  Brass Butin Funk Overload
[8986.05s -> 8992.75s]  and then there's
[8992.75s -> 8994.75s]  Funk Overload
[8994.75s -> 9008.70s]  Is this what you guys want?
[9008.70s -> 9011.65s]  This is the real song, right?
[9011.65s -> 9026.37s]  Is this the actual one?
[9026.37s -> 9030.53s]  I don't have the regular one.
[9030.53s -> 9033.02s]  This is the original?
[9069.76s -> 9129.52s]  Jackass alert!
[9129.52s -> 9152.16s]  Hey!
[9158.43s -> 9167.50s]  I got it wrong.
[9167.50s -> 9192.13s]  I got it wrong. Break it!
[9192.13s -> 9201.22s]  Lusting
[9201.22s -> 9203.22s]  and his hunger for power
[9203.22s -> 9205.22s]  became known to more and more people.
[9205.22s -> 9207.22s]  The demands to do
[9207.22s -> 9209.22s]  something about this outrageous
[9209.22s -> 9211.22s]  man became louder
[9211.22s -> 9236.43s]  and louder.
[9236.43s -> 9238.43s]  It still goes. This is a long song.
[9304.67s -> 9308.83s]  Wait! One more time?
[9308.83s -> 9310.83s]  Alright, now let's do this one!
[9310.83s -> 9318.64s]  This is the Super Saiyan
[9318.64s -> 9355.12s]  version of that song.
[9357.12s -> 9359.12s]  It's just times
[9359.12s -> 9361.12s]  two speed.
[9401.34s -> 9403.34s]  President Slaver!
[9403.34s -> 9406.48s]  President Slaver!
[9406.48s -> 9412.69s]  Uh oh!
[9412.69s -> 9414.69s]  President Slaver!
[9414.69s -> 9416.69s]  Get out of here!
[9416.69s -> 9425.65s]  One more brass beat and we're out.
[9425.65s -> 9433.14s]  We're out.
[9459.14s -> 9461.14s]  I don't give a shit!
[9461.14s -> 9463.14s]  Let's go!
[9463.14s -> 9478.75s]  There's so many!
[9482.46s -> 9485.28s]  I don't give a shit!
[9515.23s -> 9517.23s]  Let's go!
[9521.23s -> 9523.23s]  Let's go!
[9538.69s -> 9542.66s]  I can't feel it!
[9542.66s -> 9544.66s]  You guys are fucking
[9544.66s -> 9546.66s]  so in my head. God damn it!
[9546.66s -> 9548.66s]  It was the end of the song.
[9548.66s -> 9550.66s]  I could just feel them fucking in my body.
[9550.66s -> 9552.66s]  That you guys were just...
[9552.66s -> 9562.32s]  I was getting resident sleeper.
[9562.32s -> 9564.62s]  Toonuk Toonuk?
[9564.62s -> 9566.62s]  Alright, this is a mod request. I know what this one is.
[9572.51s -> 9577.89s]  I couldn't pay attention.
[9577.89s -> 9579.89s]  This is it, right? There's only one expert though.
[9579.89s -> 9581.89s]  Why are they all expert only?
[9581.89s -> 9592.58s]  Make them hard.
[9592.58s -> 9594.58s]  Oh yeah, this song is fucking
[9594.58s -> 9596.58s]  fire. I remember this one.
[9596.58s -> 9721.30s]  Bring it on!
[9721.30s -> 9768.13s]  It's a good song.
[9794.66s -> 9796.66s]  What could he do after?
[9796.66s -> 9802.61s]  What is it?
[9802.61s -> 9804.61s]  Oh, those fuckups at the time!
[9810.91s -> 9819.62s]  You get the first note wrong.
[9819.62s -> 9851.87s]  Resident sleeper.
[9851.87s -> 9890.66s]  Wait, is it resident sleeper
[9890.66s -> 9945.89s]  game or resident sleeper
[9945.89s -> 9960.21s]  song?
[9960.21s -> 9991.89s]  I don't know.
[9991.89s -> 9993.89s]  Resident sleeper.
[9993.89s -> 10005.02s]  Wait, is it resident sleeper
[10005.02s -> 10007.02s]  game or resident sleeper song?
[10007.02s -> 10009.02s]  That's really important distinction.
[10017.41s -> 10028.54s]  Everybody's screaming.
[10028.54s -> 10030.54s]  Everybody's screaming.
[10030.54s -> 10033.87s]  What's Tachyon?
[10033.87s -> 10048.64s]  Tachyon.
[10048.64s -> 10051.52s]  Looks like you wanted me to see that.
[10051.52s -> 10060.10s]  You want me to do it?
[10060.10s -> 10062.10s]  Yes, yes, yes, yes. Jesus!
[10062.10s -> 10069.70s]  Alright.
[10069.70s -> 10081.20s]  Like this, right?
[10081.20s -> 10083.20s]  I don't think it exists, guys.
[10083.20s -> 10088.56s]  Sorry. Did I spell it right?
[10088.56s -> 10091.94s]  Like that, right?
[10091.94s -> 10095.78s]  I think you guys got ultimate baited.
[10095.78s -> 10098.27s]  I'm sorry.
[10098.27s -> 10128.34s]  No, I don't think it's here.
[10128.34s -> 10131.66s]  Alright, I don't know what any of this shit is.
[10131.66s -> 10133.97s]  Do space channel five?
[10133.97s -> 10144.06s]  That's a good idea. Space channel!
[10144.06s -> 10148.16s]  Wait, is there no space channel?
[10148.16s -> 10165.62s]  Jojo?
[10165.62s -> 10167.62s]  Bustin?
[10167.62s -> 10170.88s]  If Bustin's on here, I'll try it.
[10170.88s -> 10173.70s]  Like that, right?
[10173.70s -> 10178.50s]  Is this it? Which is the right one?
[10178.50s -> 10180.86s]  Which is the correct one?
[10180.86s -> 10194.16s]  The top one or the middle one?
[10194.16s -> 10197.42s]  Alright. What else are we going to queue up here?
[10197.42s -> 10201.46s]  I don't... Jojo's Bizarre Adventure...
[10201.46s -> 10203.46s]  I don't even know... How am I even going to
[10203.46s -> 10206.46s]  pretend I know the beat to those songs?
[10206.46s -> 10208.46s]  I've never seen Jojo. Why would I...
[10208.46s -> 10211.86s]  Jojo? Jojo.
[10211.86s -> 10217.68s]  Jojo's Bizarre Adventure opening four.
[10217.68s -> 10223.44s]  Which one of these
[10223.44s -> 10226.77s]  openings am I going to pick?
[10226.77s -> 10229.39s]  We've got opening two.
[10229.39s -> 10233.55s]  I'm seeing a lot of twos.
[10233.55s -> 10236.43s]  Jojo's Bizarre Adventure opening
[10236.43s -> 10238.43s]  two.
[10238.43s -> 10241.63s]  Okay. I'll play this for 30 seconds
[10241.63s -> 10244.45s]  and I'm instant deleting it.
[10244.45s -> 10246.45s]  Alright. So we got... We got...

[10254.06s -> 10285.36s]  Scouse Busters.
[10285.36s -> 10288.18s]  Let me tell you something.
[10288.18s -> 10294.30s]  Let me tell you something.
[10294.30s -> 10307.49s]  I lost the first note.
[10307.49s -> 10309.49s]  I lost the first note. I fucked it up.
[10309.49s -> 10314.10s]  Is it moving around?
[10314.10s -> 10316.10s]  It's like having to step like all the way over here.
[10316.10s -> 10318.10s]  I have like the room scale
[10318.10s -> 10320.10s]  shit. So I gotta like move and
[10320.10s -> 10322.10s]  box me up. I got it. Let's go. Let's do it.
[10322.10s -> 10324.10s]  It's the first time I've failed fucking hardly.
[10355.82s -> 10448.43s]  Freaking man.
[10532.32s -> 10557.14s]  C.
[10557.14s -> 10566.27s]  C. I'll take C.
[10566.27s -> 10568.27s]  Alright. I'm going to say like two or three
[10568.27s -> 10570.27s]  more songs and I'm going to have to take another like water break.
[10574.69s -> 10576.69s]  Alright. Right. I forgot.
[10576.69s -> 10578.69s]  Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
[10631.07s -> 10645.86s]  Nope. God. I have no idea
[10645.86s -> 10648.54s]  how that song goes.
[10648.54s -> 10658.53s]  There's a bunch of fucking trumpets.
[10658.53s -> 10662.69s]  Yo.
[10662.69s -> 10665.44s]  Alright. Let's do
[10665.44s -> 10668.83s]  YMCA. Africa.
[10668.83s -> 10675.04s]  Where is it? Is it up? Where is it?
[10675.04s -> 10679.71s]  Oh. Here it is.
[10679.71s -> 10683.23s]  Okay. We've got AfriQ.
[10683.23s -> 10688.16s]  How about Dancing Queen?
[10688.16s -> 10692.06s]  This fucking...
[10692.06s -> 10694.06s]  This stream is going down.
[10694.06s -> 10708.26s]  YMCA.
[10708.26s -> 10710.26s]  YMCA. And then I delete
[10710.26s -> 10714.54s]  the VOD. This version with no bombs?
[10714.54s -> 10721.25s]  Nah. That's fine.
[10721.25s -> 10724.32s]  Alright. Let's go. We'll do these and I'll see
[10724.32s -> 10726.32s]  how I'm doing. I'm going to get some more water though.
[10726.32s -> 10733.34s]  YMCA is right here.
[10733.34s -> 10736.72s]  Here we go.
[10736.72s -> 10742.67s]  No. No. No.
[10742.67s -> 10744.67s]  I wore special tech wear today.
[10744.67s -> 10746.67s]  See? Like heat wear. This is like
[10746.67s -> 10751.02s]  workout clothes.
[10751.02s -> 10753.02s]  Imagine how embarrassing that would be if you were at a wedding.
[10753.02s -> 10755.02s]  That was like a wedding DJ.
[10755.02s -> 10757.02s]  Alright everybody. Let's go on.
[10757.02s -> 10759.02s]  And here comes the bride
[10759.02s -> 10761.02s]  and groom. Mr. and Mrs.
[10761.02s -> 10763.02s]  Oh I'm so sorry.
[10763.02s -> 10770.19s]  I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened
[10770.19s -> 10772.19s]  folks. This doesn't usually happen.
[10772.19s -> 10774.19s]  I just like burrow in the wedding. I'm so sorry.
[10774.19s -> 10817.95s]  What the fuck?
[10817.95s -> 10819.95s]  That was so dumb.
[10819.95s -> 10821.95s]  Ladies and gentlemen, please
[10821.95s -> 10825.41s]  welcome
[10825.41s -> 10827.58s]  the bridesmaids.
[10827.58s -> 10830.46s]  Here they come.
[10830.46s -> 10832.46s]  Accompanying Ashley
[10832.46s -> 10834.46s]  it's the
[10834.46s -> 10836.46s]  groom's best friend
[10836.46s -> 10840.18s]  Michael.
[10840.18s -> 10842.18s]  I'm going to do like this. You're going to go out there and cheer.
[10842.18s -> 10869.44s]  YMCA.
[10869.44s -> 10882.82s]  He's fucking
[10882.82s -> 10890.37s]  bummed. No. No. We're done with
[10890.37s -> 10892.37s]  that one. We're done with that one.
[10892.37s -> 10896.91s]  I'm not doing that one again.
[10896.91s -> 10905.62s]  And ladies and gentlemen
[10905.62s -> 10908.30s]  please welcome
[10908.30s -> 10910.30s]  the father and mother of the group.
[10910.30s -> 10913.38s]  I'm so sorry. I don't know.
[10913.38s -> 10915.38s]  It's my first time doing a fucking wedding DJ job.
[10947.89s -> 10964.21s]  I'm so sorry.
[10964.21s -> 10966.21s]  That's too much fucking squicking around.
[10966.21s -> 10968.21s]  Switching around and shit.
[10968.21s -> 10972.18s]  First dance rune.
[10972.18s -> 10974.18s]  I'm getting gamer fatigue too.
[10974.18s -> 10976.42s]  Gamer fatigue is settling in.
[11052.93s -> 11054.93s]  Here we go. Here we go. I made it.
[11096.08s -> 11098.08s]  Here we go.
[11121.20s -> 11142.00s]  Someone's caught on me.
[11142.00s -> 11189.22s]  Damn it!
[11189.22s -> 11191.58s]  I was so sad about that one.
[11191.58s -> 11193.58s]  Alright. Fuck gamer fatigue. You know how it is.
[11193.58s -> 11198.38s]  What else do I have here?
[11198.38s -> 11202.54s]  Alright. We'll do one more. What's the number one?
[11202.54s -> 11210.53s]  Take a break.
[11210.53s -> 11216.80s]  I will in a second. One more song.
[11216.80s -> 11218.80s]  Let's go.
[11218.80s -> 11220.80s]  So far they're popular. We've picked a bunch.
[11220.80s -> 11222.80s]  Sort by
[11222.80s -> 11231.12s]  like plays, alright?
[11231.12s -> 11235.41s]  Midnight City.
[11235.41s -> 11238.29s]  Pirate the Box.
[11238.29s -> 11241.62s]  American Idiot, really?
[11241.62s -> 11249.49s]  Dota? This is not what I'm going on about.
[11249.49s -> 11252.11s]  We're leaving.
[11252.11s -> 11254.11s]  I'm going to take a break in a second. This is the last song I'm going to do.
[11254.11s -> 11266.40s]  Where is it?
[11266.40s -> 11272.66s]  Where the fuck did it go? Pure Imagination.
[11272.66s -> 11274.66s]  Am I stupid?
[11279.98s -> 11281.98s]  Did I not download it?
[11281.98s -> 11290.30s]  Am I actually dumb here?
[11290.30s -> 11296.06s]  I might be stupid.
[11296.06s -> 11298.62s]  It's queued.
[11298.62s -> 11312.51s]  Maybe this one wasn't done downloading.
[11312.51s -> 11320.45s]  Okay. 100%. No fucking
[11320.45s -> 11322.45s]  no mix ups.
[11322.45s -> 11324.45s]  Pure Imagination.
[11324.45s -> 11344.22s]  This is the one I'm going on. This is it.
[11344.22s -> 11346.22s]  Make a wish. Make a wish?
[11346.22s -> 11351.66s]  Count to three.
[11398.38s -> 11400.38s]  Toddler Tantrum.
[11400.38s -> 11407.09s]  That's right!
[11436.69s -> 11438.69s]  Boomer Emo.
[11438.69s -> 11440.69s]  This is a classic song, guys.
[11440.69s -> 11462.90s]  From a classic movie.
[11462.90s -> 11465.52s]  From a classic actor.
[11465.52s -> 11467.52s]  I've got to be like dancing around.
[11467.52s -> 11469.52s]  That's my problem.
[11486.56s -> 11491.15s]  Simply look around.
[11491.15s -> 11498.05s]  You will need to change
[11498.05s -> 11519.04s]  the world.
[11524.08s -> 11526.08s]  Pure Imagination.
[11526.08s -> 11528.83s]  Living in
[11528.83s -> 11531.14s]  the only
[11531.14s -> 11533.14s]  way
[11533.14s -> 11535.14s]  in which you
[11535.14s -> 11537.14s]  truly
[11537.14s -> 11557.09s]  wish.
[11557.09s -> 11592.93s]  I have one more idea for good measure. Let's go ahead.
[11592.93s -> 11601.12s]  I love these Boomer songs.
[11605.12s -> 11612.66s]  Alright, that's it.
[11612.66s -> 11635.18s]  That's it.
[11635.18s -> 11637.18s]  Did I spell it wrong?
[11637.18s -> 11639.18s]  Like this?
[11639.18s -> 11642.51s]  Like talk?
[11642.51s -> 11645.33s]  Which one?
[11645.33s -> 11655.31s]  Like this one?
[11655.31s -> 11661.76s]  This one right here.
[11661.76s -> 11664.75s]  Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[11664.75s -> 11668.32s]  Is it on? Expert? I'm not going to be able to do this.
[11668.32s -> 11678.56s]  I'll give it one attempt. I'll try.
[11678.56s -> 11683.55s]  Alright.
[11683.55s -> 11687.46s]  Alright.
[11687.46s -> 11690.46s]  Alright.
[11690.46s -> 11692.64s]  I'll give it one attempt. I'll try.
[11692.64s -> 11699.04s]  Alright, I'll try it once.
[11699.04s -> 11701.04s]  This is the last song.
[11701.04s -> 11703.04s]  I've got to get at it. I'm going to take a break.
[11703.04s -> 11705.04s]  We'll see.
[11705.04s -> 11707.04s]  Let me see how I'm doing.
[11707.04s -> 11709.04s]  Alright, let's do it.
[11714.14s -> 11723.62s]  What the fuck?
[11732.77s -> 11740.26s]  I didn't even get to the fucking title of the song.
[11740.26s -> 11745.81s]  Get in with the team.
[11745.81s -> 11760.64s]  Get in with the team.
[11760.64s -> 11762.64s]  Get in with the team.
[11762.64s -> 11764.64s]  Get in with the team.
[11764.64s -> 11768.99s]  Hey, you got it.
[11768.99s -> 11782.35s]  You got to hear it.
[11782.35s -> 11810.96s]  I have the high ground. What is this?
[11810.96s -> 11823.06s]  I have the high ground.
[11823.06s -> 11832.91s]  I don't understand.
[11832.91s -> 11838.93s]  I don't understand.
[11838.93s -> 11843.97s]  It's over, Anakin.
[11859.28s -> 11863.18s]  Oh my god, it's the fight.
[11865.18s -> 11870.50s]  It's over, Anakin.
[11870.50s -> 11872.50s]  I have the high ground.
[11872.50s -> 11876.59s]  You underestimate my power.
[11876.59s -> 11879.09s]  Don't try it.
[11889.57s -> 11891.57s]  Oh yeah, he cuts his legs.
[11891.57s -> 11895.28s]  Why don't you make
[11895.28s -> 11897.28s]  what I think is E.
[11897.28s -> 11899.28s]  I got the E. What does that mean?
[11899.28s -> 11921.66s]  Did I get another one? I got the Force theme.
[11921.66s -> 11925.06s]  It's in there. Who the fuck is it?
[11925.06s -> 11943.54s]  Here we go.
[11943.54s -> 12019.76s]  This is actually the last one.
[12019.76s -> 12068.70s]  Sorry. Here it comes.
[12068.70s -> 12130.19s]  This is not Star Wars.
[12134.59s -> 12136.59s]  I think this thing is glued to my face.
[12136.59s -> 12138.59s]  If I pull it off, I think skin's going to come off.
[12138.59s -> 12141.41s]  Should I be concerned about this?
[12141.41s -> 12143.41s]  I'm going to hurt myself, I think.
[12143.41s -> 12145.41s]  It's going to be like
[12145.41s -> 12147.41s]  the jelly skin is going to come out.
[12147.41s -> 12149.41s]  Like 40 strings attached to my face.
[12149.41s -> 12152.35s]  Don't end on that one.
[12152.35s -> 12154.35s]  What's the hardest one in the whole game?
[12154.35s -> 12166.58s]  Fire and Flames? Is it the hardest one
[12166.58s -> 12171.63s]  in the whole game? It's probably
[12171.63s -> 12174.96s]  Cotton Eye Joe?
[12174.96s -> 12176.96s]  It is Han Solo.
[12176.96s -> 12178.96s]  No it's not. Why the fuck would the hardest thing in the game
[12178.96s -> 12187.02s]  be Han Solo?
[12187.02s -> 12190.29s]  Let's do Fire and Flames on Expert Plus.
[12190.29s -> 12194.38s]  I'm going to fit.
[12194.38s -> 12197.14s]  Fire and Flames.
[12197.14s -> 12207.95s]  I think I'm just going to have to live in here.
[12207.95s -> 12211.60s]  This is the last one.
[12211.60s -> 12215.38s]  Then I've got to take a break.
[12219.94s -> 12221.94s]  This is not the song.
[12221.94s -> 12227.25s]  Give me a fucking break.
[12230.45s -> 12233.20s]  What the fuck? It's impossible.
[12233.20s -> 12277.17s]  Let me try it again.
[12277.17s -> 12279.17s]  I got fucking at least kind of far. I got far enough.
[12279.17s -> 12289.78s]  I can get it. It's like
[12289.78s -> 12310.82s]  just goes like this.
[12310.82s -> 12313.31s]  Easy with the hair.
[12313.31s -> 12315.31s]  Uh oh. This is bad.
[12315.31s -> 12330.91s]  What year is it?
[12330.91s -> 12341.97s]  What year is it?
[12341.97s -> 12345.17s]  Alright. Put that down. I'm going to get some more water.
[12345.17s -> 12351.76s]  I'll be right back. What a goddamn blast.
[12351.76s -> 12363.46s]  Fucking rat's nest.
[12363.46s -> 12365.46s]  Alright. I will be right back.
[12365.46s -> 12367.46s]  I'm going to get some water. I'll see you guys in
[12367.46s -> 12369.89s]  two to three minutes. Something like that.
[12369.89s -> 12560.35s]  Okay. So here's the plan.
[12560.35s -> 12564.61s]  Hello. Hi.
[12564.61s -> 12567.04s]  The plan is
[12567.04s -> 12569.04s]  we take a break from Intense VR.
[12569.04s -> 12571.04s]  And we're going to move on to
[12571.04s -> 12573.04s]  a bartender simulator.
[12573.04s -> 12575.04s]  You just make drinks.
[12575.04s -> 12577.04s]  You just sit there. You relax. You like poor shit.
[12577.04s -> 12579.04s]  We're just going to chill. We're going to wind down.
[12579.04s -> 12581.54s]  Because I'm like
[12581.54s -> 12583.90s]  it's like a three and a half hour workout.
[12583.90s -> 12586.53s]  Does anybody else get this
[12586.53s -> 12588.53s]  sweaty and disgusting when they play VR?
[12588.53s -> 12591.34s]  Am I like the only streamer that
[12591.34s -> 12593.34s]  his whole body deteriorates?
[12593.34s -> 12601.20s]  Okay.
[12601.20s -> 12603.20s]  So give me one second. I've got to get it set up.
[12603.20s -> 12605.20s]  I'll be right back while I get the game
[12605.20s -> 12607.38s]  ready to go. See you soon.
[12607.38s -> 12692.62s]  Alright. Give me
[12692.62s -> 12695.76s]  a second.
[12695.76s -> 12697.76s]  I promise that I'm
[12697.76s -> 12699.76s]  this fucking gross every stream.
[12699.76s -> 12701.76s]  This looks like I haven't
[12701.76s -> 12703.76s]  showered or bathed
[12703.76s -> 12706.58s]  in weeks.
[12706.58s -> 12708.58s]  I've got my gear on. Like I've got my
[12708.58s -> 12711.58s]  wear on.
[12711.58s -> 12713.58s]  Alright. I apparently didn't install
[12713.58s -> 12715.58s]  this game. I thought I did.
[12715.58s -> 12717.58s]  So we've got three minutes to just hang out.
[12717.58s -> 12720.27s]  Which is good. This is a good enough time for me to
[12720.27s -> 12722.70s]  relax for a minute.
[12722.70s -> 12724.70s]  Alright. So let me tell you my first impressions.
[12724.70s -> 12727.26s]  Super hot. VR was phenomenal.
[12729.44s -> 12731.68s]  Experience is only like an hour and a half or so.
[12731.68s -> 12733.68s]  One to two hours long. Which is I mean
[12733.68s -> 12735.68s]  what you get is worth it I think.
[12735.68s -> 12737.68s]  There's a lot of replayability to try to get your scores
[12737.68s -> 12740.37s]  better. The game was amazing.
[12740.37s -> 12742.80s]  Beat Saber is just
[12742.80s -> 12744.80s]  a new, better version
[12744.80s -> 12746.80s]  of what Guitar Hero tried to do.
[12746.80s -> 12748.80s]  Like years ago.
[12748.80s -> 12750.80s]  It gets you up. It gets you moving.
[12750.80s -> 12752.80s]  You actually have to feel the beat with your hands.
[12752.80s -> 12754.80s]  I mean Rock Band and shit like that
[12754.80s -> 12757.42s]  with the drums. That was cool.
[12757.42s -> 12759.42s]  But you weren't like inside of the beat.
[12759.42s -> 12765.76s]  It's got a receding hairline. What?
[12765.76s -> 12768.70s]  I can't do the whole. Guys I can't do the whole
[12768.70s -> 12772.61s]  Shrek movie. If I do the whole
[12772.61s -> 12774.61s]  Shrek movie. I'll be lucky if this
[12774.61s -> 12776.61s]  stream. I'm gonna get like a
[12776.61s -> 12778.61s]  I'm gonna get a knock on my fucking door.
[12778.61s -> 12780.61s]  Like Twitch staff.
[12780.61s -> 12783.10s]  Hey man. Like don't fucking. Don't do that.
[12783.10s -> 12785.10s]  Don't like just play random movie clips.
[12785.10s -> 12787.10s]  And uh
[12787.10s -> 12789.10s]  Full copyright songs.
[12789.10s -> 12796.64s]  Alright. Let me get ready.
[12796.64s -> 12798.64s]  Should be back on like this.
[12798.64s -> 12801.71s]  You just did?
[12801.71s -> 12806.32s]  Oh I know. This looks
[12806.32s -> 12808.32s]  I don't even care. You know like
[12808.32s -> 12810.32s]  sometimes you give a shit about your appearance.
[12810.32s -> 12812.32s]  When the webcam goes on.
[12812.32s -> 12815.14s]  And I know the webcam's on.
[12815.14s -> 12817.14s]  Usually I'm a little self conscious.
[12817.14s -> 12819.14s]  I want to make sure that I look okay.
[12819.14s -> 12821.14s]  How's my face look? Do I look alright?
[12821.14s -> 12823.14s]  Do I look okay?
[12823.14s -> 12825.14s]  I don't care right now. And you can just tell.
[12825.14s -> 12827.14s]  And these images are gonna
[12827.14s -> 12829.14s]  come back to haunt me in like fucking
[12829.14s -> 12832.53s]  two years.
[12832.53s -> 12834.53s]  I don't even care. Like I just don't
[12834.53s -> 12836.53s]  Typically I'd be like oh hold on. Before I turn
[12836.53s -> 12838.53s]  the camera on. Let me like. Okay.
[12838.53s -> 12842.99s]  Hey guys. Hey what's up?
[12842.99s -> 12846.43s]  Hey. What are you guys up to?
[12846.43s -> 12851.15s]  Gives a shit.
[12851.15s -> 12858.19s]  Alright. One minute. You look like you just
[12858.19s -> 12862.29s]  exited a time machine.
[12862.29s -> 12865.55s]  My DNA's been scrambled.
[12865.55s -> 12867.55s]  I don't think this is on Twitch.
[12867.55s -> 12870.24s]  VR like bartender?
[12870.24s -> 12876.06s]  I don't think I can even make this a
[12876.06s -> 12878.06s]  bartender.
[12878.06s -> 12882.59s]  No.
[12882.59s -> 12884.59s]  What am I supposed to put for a category?
[12884.59s -> 12886.59s]  Is there just like a general
[12886.59s -> 12897.22s]  VR? I can't put a category
[12897.22s -> 12902.91s]  here. There's no just
[12902.91s -> 12905.86s]  general VR.
[12905.86s -> 12907.86s]  What about like virtual games and demos?
[12907.86s -> 12910.93s]  I guess. Yeah.
[12910.93s -> 12922.64s]  Let's put it to games and demos.
[12922.64s -> 12924.64s]  Your hair immediately after you take the headset off
[12924.64s -> 12926.64s]  gives me so much anxiety. Well I'm getting a haircut.
[12926.64s -> 12931.70s]  I'll get my haircut.
[12931.70s -> 12934.58s]  Alright. We're ready to do this.
[12934.58s -> 12936.82s]  I'm gonna get back in.
[12936.82s -> 12938.82s]  Take another sip of this. My
[12938.82s -> 12944.70s]  handy drink.
[12944.70s -> 12948.85s]  Here we go.
[12948.85s -> 12950.85s]  I have no idea what this game is. All I know is it was $20.
[12950.85s -> 12952.85s]  So let's hope it was worth $20.
[12952.85s -> 12961.23s]  Windows Firewall has
[12961.23s -> 12963.23s]  blocked this game. Why?
[12963.23s -> 12971.74s]  For one thing it's pretty fucking loud.
[12971.74s -> 12978.90s]  Turn it down a little.
[12978.90s -> 12980.90s]  Okay. Let's go.
[12980.90s -> 12982.90s]  This is Bartender Simulator.
[12982.90s -> 12995.63s]  Imagine paying $20 to give yourself
[12995.63s -> 13001.20s]  malware. I apologize in advance
[13001.20s -> 13003.20s]  for the puke cam that's about to show up
[13003.20s -> 13030.21s]  here.
[13030.21s -> 13033.60s]  Okay. Nightclub
[13033.60s -> 13035.84s]  Bar...
[13035.84s -> 13040.26s]  One more sip of this. I'm gonna need it.
[13040.26s -> 13049.41s]  Controls are down there.
[13049.41s -> 13051.41s]  Let's get into the position.
[13051.41s -> 13054.99s]  I'm like centered with the frame.
[13054.99s -> 13058.06s]  I am. I look asshole.
[13058.06s -> 13060.62s]  Alright. I'm in.
[13060.62s -> 13062.62s]  There's in my hands.
[13062.62s -> 13080.34s]  I need the audio.
[13080.34s -> 13082.34s]  Imagine sending... Why is this
[13082.34s -> 13086.18s]  so delayed?
[13086.18s -> 13088.18s]  So this is good to go, right?
[13088.18s -> 13090.18s]  Nightclub Bar.

[13098.02s -> 13100.02s]  Start each new drink by placing
[13100.02s -> 13104.11s]  a napkin on the counter.
[13104.11s -> 13106.11s]  I just want to relax, guys. Don't put the drink on the napkin
[13106.11s -> 13108.11s]  until you have finished preparing it.
[13108.11s -> 13113.17s]  Place the
[13113.17s -> 13115.17s]  ingredients back to where you got them from.
[13115.17s -> 13117.79s]  Be precise when pouring
[13117.79s -> 13119.79s]  liquids. Your precision
[13119.79s -> 13121.79s]  will be rewarded, while
[13121.79s -> 13123.79s]  carelessness may result in failure.
[13123.79s -> 13125.79s]  Here comes the spill joke.
[13125.79s -> 13128.29s]  You earn points for making the drinks
[13128.29s -> 13130.29s]  as fast as possible and by demonstrating
[13130.29s -> 13132.29s]  the technique.
[13132.29s -> 13134.29s]  I've been doing one of those and like
[13134.29s -> 13136.29s]  I fell over there and I can't
[13136.29s -> 13138.29s]  reach it. What? In the practice mode,
[13138.29s -> 13140.29s]  you will be given verbal instructions and
[13140.29s -> 13142.29s]  messages displayed on your screen.
[13142.29s -> 13144.29s]  It's really fucking loud.
[13144.29s -> 13146.29s]  Should you need guidance in the game mode,
[13146.29s -> 13148.29s]  you can always press the hint button
[13148.29s -> 13150.29s]  located on the screen. Okay, so get the pours correct.
[13150.29s -> 13152.29s]  Every time you press this button,
[13152.29s -> 13154.29s]  you will lose some of the money that you have already
[13154.29s -> 13156.29s]  earned. It's about making
[13156.29s -> 13158.91s]  money?
[13158.91s -> 13160.91s]  After mastering the drinks introduced in the

[13162.91s -> 13164.91s]  a certificate for completing the Bartender
[13164.91s -> 13166.91s]  VR virtual course.
[13166.91s -> 13168.91s]  Okay. This will allow you
[13168.91s -> 13170.91s]  to go and further prove yourself
[13170.91s -> 13172.91s]  in the pro mode.
[13172.91s -> 13175.41s]  Okay. Have fun.
[13175.41s -> 13179.10s]  Thanks a lot.

[13181.10s -> 13187.89s]  Here we go! Nightclub bar
[13187.89s -> 13190.06s]  practice.
[13190.06s -> 13192.56s]  I just saw a free there.
[13192.56s -> 13195.12s]  What does that mean?

[13207.36s -> 13209.36s]  by placing the napkin on the bar.
[13209.36s -> 13211.36s]  Do not place any drink on
[13211.36s -> 13213.36s]  the napkin until it's ready to serve.
[13213.36s -> 13215.36s]  You will prepare your drink
[13215.36s -> 13217.36s]  either by holding the glass in your hand
[13217.36s -> 13219.36s]  or by placing it on the metal tip tray
[13219.36s -> 13221.36s]  at the edge of the bar.
[13221.36s -> 13223.36s]  Be precise when pouring ingredients.

[13282.80s -> 13293.81s]  Place a napkin on the bar top.
[13293.81s -> 13297.20s]  It's like that game

[13299.20s -> 13301.20s]  with the footballs and there's like the three holes.

[13825.50s -> 13827.50s]  Here we go.
[13827.50s -> 13829.50s]  Welcome. It's time to check

[13837.50s -> 13839.50s]  The drinks, which you have already learned
[13839.50s -> 13841.50s]  to make in the bar, will be selected
[13841.50s -> 13843.50s]  on a random basis.
[13843.50s -> 13845.50s]  Please follow the rules that you have learned
[13845.50s -> 13847.50s]  during the practice level.
[13847.50s -> 13849.50s]  If you don't know how to prepare a particular drink
[13849.50s -> 13851.50s]  you can use...
[13851.50s -> 13853.50s]  This bartender is fucking annoying.
[13853.50s -> 13855.50s]  Then let's go with vodka.

[13913.26s -> 13917.62s]  Pour in 40 milliliters of white rum
[13917.62s -> 13919.62s]  and 100 milliliters of cola.
[13919.62s -> 13921.62s]  And then...
[13921.62s -> 13935.76s]  And then...
[13935.76s -> 13938.45s]  straw...
[13938.45s -> 13945.86s]  wine. And then straw.
[13945.86s -> 13947.86s]  Moscow mule.
[13947.86s -> 13949.86s]  This is... Okay, this is wine.
[13949.86s -> 13953.12s]  What?
[13953.12s -> 13958.43s]  I'm gonna do a napkin first.
[13958.43s -> 13969.31s]  White rum and cola is the
[13969.31s -> 13971.31s]  chupacabra.
[13971.31s -> 13974.38s]  What's it called?
[13974.38s -> 13976.38s]  What's this actually called?
[13976.38s -> 13982.53s]  White rum and cola.
[13982.53s -> 13998.98s]  You know what? I got a fucking better idea.
[13998.98s -> 14009.73s]  Here's the better idea.
[14009.73s -> 14011.73s]  Let's go. 40 milliliter
[14011.73s -> 14014.99s]  white rum and then cola.
[14014.99s -> 14022.21s]  And then a lime
[14022.21s -> 14024.21s]  and a fucking straw.
[14024.21s -> 14027.47s]  There you go, man.
[14027.47s -> 14045.97s]  What's next? Gin and tonic.
[14045.97s -> 14058.70s]  Come on! Tricks!

[14141.73s -> 14143.73s]  What's Americano?
[14143.73s -> 14159.22s]  I don't fucking remember.
[14159.22s -> 14161.46s]  Soda? 30!
[14161.46s -> 14163.46s]  Oh my god!
[14163.46s -> 14194.62s]  Gin and tonic. I know this one.
[14194.62s -> 14197.44s]  Come on! That was pretty cool.
[14197.44s -> 14199.44s]  What is Americano?
[14199.44s -> 14205.39s]  30.
[14205.39s -> 14213.14s]  Then what?

[14218.53s -> 14224.29s]  And then what is it? A fucking lime?
[14224.29s -> 14226.29s]  80?
[14226.29s -> 14228.29s]  Who orders this fucking drink?
[14228.29s -> 14233.07s]  God!
[14233.07s -> 14256.50s]  Pour in 40 milliliters of white rum
[14256.50s -> 14258.50s]  and 100 milliliters of cola.
[14258.50s -> 14262.21s]  What are you...
[14262.21s -> 14278.66s]  3 minutes left?
[14278.66s -> 14280.66s]  52 dollars?
[14280.66s -> 14290.00s]  I know this one well.
[14290.00s -> 14314.70s]  Fuck it.
[14314.70s -> 14316.70s]  No, I know what...
[14316.70s -> 14321.25s]  Place a napkin on the bar top.
[14321.25s -> 14323.25s]  Which one is it? White rum and coke?
[14323.25s -> 14325.25s]  And 100 milliliters of cola.
[14339.52s -> 14354.62s]  What did I do wrong?
[14354.62s -> 14356.62s]  Bitters and sweet vermouth.
[14356.62s -> 14359.89s]  And 30 milliliters of sweet vermouth.
[14359.89s -> 14368.21s]  30. And then it's soda, right?
[14368.21s -> 14370.64s]  It doesn't want me to do the two.
[14370.64s -> 14372.64s]  It really does not like that I do that.
[14372.64s -> 14374.64s]  It hates that, actually. It doesn't want me to do it.
[14374.64s -> 14376.64s]  It doesn't want me to do it. That's fine.
[14376.64s -> 14378.64s]  No tricks allowed.
[14386.96s -> 14388.96s]  This one is ginger beer.
[14388.96s -> 14415.50s]  And sweet vermouth.
[14415.50s -> 14443.98s]  80.
[14443.98s -> 14445.98s]  I just want to make sure what it was.
[14445.98s -> 14449.89s]  I thought it was 100.
[14449.89s -> 14451.89s]  And then what fruit is it? What fucking fruit is it?
[14451.89s -> 14455.09s]  Orange zest.
[14455.09s -> 14459.25s]  Good luck. I got 10 seconds to make another drink.
[14459.25s -> 14471.34s]  Moscow mule.
[14471.34s -> 14474.40s]  Screenshot?
[14474.40s -> 14483.17s]  What did I take a screenshot of?
[14483.17s -> 14492.00s]  Whoa, I just fell over. That was weird.
[14492.00s -> 14494.00s]  Beach bar. Single drink.
[14494.00s -> 14499.31s]  Pro mode.

[14524.77s -> 14526.77s]  Oh, it's so spicy!
[14526.77s -> 14528.77s]  It's so spicy!
[14528.77s -> 14531.26s]  Anybody know what that is?
[14541.26s -> 14543.26s]  Excuse me.
[14543.26s -> 14545.26s]  Where the fuck were you yesterday?
[14549.26s -> 14552.98s]  Bar spoon?
[14552.98s -> 14554.98s]  What's this gigantic cigarette?
[14557.22s -> 14559.22s]  Let me just test this out.
[14559.22s -> 14563.95s]  It needs a little more salt.
[14563.95s -> 14575.47s]  I hit something.
[14575.47s -> 14578.22s]  I'm hitting something.
[14578.22s -> 14592.75s]  What am I hitting? I can't even go over there.
[14592.75s -> 14595.38s]  I can't go over there.
[14612.02s -> 14615.54s]  Let's get a napkin out here.
[14615.54s -> 14617.54s]  Make a mojito.
[14620.10s -> 14622.10s]  Four limes. You got it.
[14622.10s -> 14624.91s]  One, two.
[14624.91s -> 14626.91s]  Why don't you pick it up upside down?
[14626.91s -> 14628.91s]  Why would you pick that up upside down?
[14630.91s -> 14641.15s]  20 milliliters of sugar syrup.
[14641.15s -> 14643.52s]  Sugar syrup?
[14643.52s -> 14646.27s]  Which one of these is sugar?
[14646.27s -> 14653.06s]  40? 20?
[14653.06s -> 14655.06s]  Sugar and limes and you mash them up.
[14655.06s -> 14663.31s]  10 mint leaves.
[14663.31s -> 14674.64s]  10 mint leaves.
[14674.64s -> 14676.64s]  Put the long glass with crushed ice.

[14726.51s -> 14731.38s]  Decorate with a sprig of mint.
[14731.38s -> 14734.77s]  Oh.
[14734.77s -> 14736.77s]  Serve the drink on the napkin.
[14736.77s -> 14741.31s]  How am I ever going to remember that?

[14743.31s -> 14745.31s]  Place a napkin on the bar top.
[14745.31s -> 14747.31s]  Place a napkin there?
[14747.31s -> 14749.31s]  Put it in one place.
[14749.31s -> 14751.31s]  Four lime wedges into the whiskey glass.
[14751.31s -> 14753.31s]  We've got it.

[14755.31s -> 14757.31s]  Take the muddler and muddle the limes.
[14757.31s -> 14759.31s]  Where is the mud? There it is.
[14761.31s -> 14764.38s]  Fill the glass up with crushed ice.
[14764.38s -> 14768.22s]  Oh, that's cubed ice.
[14768.22s -> 14770.22s]  Wrong one.
[14770.22s -> 14774.32s]  40 milliliters of kashasa.
[14774.32s -> 14776.32s]  Kashasa?
[14776.32s -> 14778.32s]  40 is kashasa.
[14778.32s -> 14780.75s]  And then sugar.
[14780.75s -> 14783.63s]  That's not the right one. Where's sugar?
[14783.63s -> 14785.94s]  Sugar syrup.
[14785.94s -> 14792.53s]  Place the bar spoon in the whiskey glass.
[14792.53s -> 14801.87s]  The way I mix it up?
[14801.87s -> 14803.87s]  This is just like an ear wax cleaning video.
[14803.87s -> 14808.30s]  This is just the doctor office close-up videos that people watch for some reason.
[14808.30s -> 14810.30s]  Top up with more crushed ice.
[14812.30s -> 14816.21s]  Decorate with a wedge of lime.

[14820.21s -> 14823.09s]  Two short straws?
[14823.09s -> 14825.09s]  Serve the drink on the napkin.
[14825.09s -> 14827.09s]  Am I going to bump into this?
[14827.09s -> 14829.09s]  I'm going to hit something. The wall is right here.
[14829.09s -> 14837.66s]  Am I going to hit something?
[14837.66s -> 14840.16s]  You can take it. It's right there.
[14840.16s -> 14843.10s]  Piperino.
[14843.10s -> 14848.42s]  Place the napkin on the bottle.
[14848.42s -> 14850.85s]  Can I even make it if I toss it?
[14850.85s -> 14855.84s]  No. It's not going to work.
[14857.84s -> 14859.84s]  It's your drink.
[14859.84s -> 14861.84s]  Welcome to the beach.
[14861.84s -> 14863.84s]  There it is.
[14863.84s -> 14865.84s]  Oh my god.
[14865.84s -> 14867.84s]  It just explodes.
[14867.84s -> 14869.84s]  Alright, let me get through this one.
[14869.84s -> 14871.84s]  I'm going to just be very...
[14871.84s -> 14874.46s]  Take a whiskey glass and drop four lime wedges into it.
[14874.46s -> 14876.46s]  Who even wants this?
[14876.46s -> 14879.79s]  I'm hitting something.
[14879.79s -> 14882.29s]  Take the muddle and muddle the lines.
[14882.29s -> 14887.47s]  Fill the glass up with crushed ice.

[15012.80s -> 15014.80s]  Place the napkin on the bar top.
[15014.80s -> 15018.13s]  No, I'm not going to be able to get that one.
[15018.13s -> 15020.88s]  Take a coke and fill it up with ice cubes.
[15022.88s -> 15024.88s]  That's going to be interesting.
[15024.88s -> 15031.47s]  Pour in 80 milliliters of prosecco
[15031.47s -> 15033.47s]  and 60 milliliters of aperitivo.

[15087.79s -> 15097.52s]  Sex on the beach.
[15097.52s -> 15099.52s]  Place a napkin on the bar top.
[15099.52s -> 15106.82s]  Take a long glass
[15106.82s -> 15108.82s]  and fill it with ice cubes.
[15108.82s -> 15113.68s]  Pour in 40 milliliters of vodka
[15113.68s -> 15115.68s]  and 20 milliliters of peach schnapps.
[15119.58s -> 15121.58s]  And 20 of peach schnapps.
[15121.58s -> 15124.98s]  How about this one for you?
[15124.98s -> 15144.50s]  Pay attention to that.
[15144.50s -> 15146.50s]  Sex on the beach.
[15146.50s -> 15148.50s]  Place a napkin on the bar top.
[15150.50s -> 15152.50s]  Okay, let's put a napkin up there.
[15152.50s -> 15154.50s]  Take a long glass and fill it with ice cubes.
[15157.89s -> 15160.51s]  Uh, god damn it.
[15160.51s -> 15164.16s]  Pour in 40 milliliters of vodka
[15164.16s -> 15166.16s]  and 20 milliliters of peach schnapps.
[15168.16s -> 15173.28s]  Top up with 60 milliliters of orange juice.
[15173.28s -> 15175.28s]  60 of orange juice?
[15175.28s -> 15177.28s]  And 60 milliliters of cranberry juice.
[15177.28s -> 15179.28s]  Oh.
[15185.60s -> 15187.60s]  Ah, it's such a hot day.
[15187.60s -> 15189.60s]  Oh, thank god.
[15189.60s -> 15200.93s]  I really needed that.
[15200.93s -> 15204.64s]  It looks good.
[15204.64s -> 15213.98s]  What was I doing? Oh, 60.
[15213.98s -> 15223.46s]  These can't break.
[15223.46s -> 15225.46s]  I made it a plastic.
[15225.46s -> 15227.46s]  Slice of orange and a cherry.
[15227.46s -> 15229.46s]  And two long straws.
[15229.46s -> 15231.46s]  Two long straws?
[15231.46s -> 15233.82s]  Ooh.
[15233.82s -> 15235.82s]  Serve the drink on the napkin.
[15235.82s -> 15240.82s]  Here you go!
[15240.82s -> 15248.93s]  That's it.
[15248.93s -> 15261.58s]  Now let's go to the menu.
[15261.58s -> 15263.58s]  Single drink, nightclub,
[15263.58s -> 15265.58s]  beach bar,
[15265.58s -> 15267.58s]  rooftop. What a single drink.
[15267.58s -> 15269.89s]  This is gin and tonic.
[15269.89s -> 15278.00s]  Do I get like actual customers or is this it?
[15278.00s -> 15281.78s]  Gin and tonic.
[15281.78s -> 15283.78s]  How many gin and tonics can I make in 10 minutes?
[15283.78s -> 15286.66s]  I'm not sure there's anything else
[15286.66s -> 15293.63s]  left to do.
[15293.63s -> 15295.63s]  I do like the challenge mode.
[15295.63s -> 15301.52s]  Rooftop lounge.
[15301.52s -> 15303.52s]  Rooftop VIP bar.
[15303.52s -> 15305.52s]  Tutorial profile settings.
[15305.52s -> 15308.27s]  What else is there to do?
[15308.27s -> 15310.27s]  Is the pro mode the thing that I need to do?
[15310.27s -> 15312.27s]  Free play?
[15312.27s -> 15318.86s]  Okay, let's do
[15318.86s -> 15320.86s]  free play at the beach.
[15320.86s -> 15322.86s]  Alright, what do we need here?
[15322.86s -> 15326.90s]  When your drink is ready, serve it on the napkin
[15326.90s -> 15328.90s]  and check what you have made.
[15328.90s -> 15331.97s]  I can make my own drinks?
[15331.97s -> 15334.72s]  Really?
[15334.72s -> 15337.02s]  Nice! Okay, I'm going to show you guys
[15337.02s -> 15339.02s]  the best fucking drink that you can ever drink.
[15339.02s -> 15342.80s]  Whiskey glass.
[15342.80s -> 15344.80s]  Get it up there.
[15344.80s -> 15346.80s]  They have whiskey.
[15346.80s -> 15348.80s]  You need a good whiskey here.
[15348.80s -> 15357.50s]  I don't have any whiskey, so
[15357.50s -> 15359.50s]  never mind, get rid of that.
[15359.50s -> 15361.50s]  A regular tall glass.
[15361.50s -> 15363.50s]  Just a few cubes of ice, not very many.
[15363.50s -> 15365.50s]  That's it, you're good. That's enough of that.
[15365.50s -> 15367.50s]  The game is going to be mad if I don't fill it up.
[15367.50s -> 15369.50s]  I'm only allowed to put a certain
[15369.50s -> 15371.50s]  amount of ice, it has to be full.
[15371.50s -> 15373.50s]  I'm going to go with a
[15373.50s -> 15375.50s]  vodka. Make sure it's
[15375.50s -> 15377.50s]  good, high quality vodka. You want to fill it up about
[15379.50s -> 15383.15s]  I'd say
[15383.15s -> 15385.15s]  like the whole glass.
[15385.15s -> 15387.15s]  Even if it's a little more, it's okay.
[15387.15s -> 15390.48s]  Then what you want to do
[15390.48s -> 15393.10s]  is you want to grab a lime.
[15393.10s -> 15395.10s]  Stick a lime up on the end there.
[15395.10s -> 15397.10s]  What I like to do is I like to do a little splash
[15397.10s -> 15399.10s]  of cranberry.
[15399.10s -> 15402.11s]  Just to get it in. There it is.
[15402.11s -> 15404.11s]  There you go, get a napkin on there.
[15404.11s -> 15406.11s]  That's what I call a fucking vodka drink.
[15406.11s -> 15414.82s]  The next one
[15414.82s -> 15416.82s]  that I'm going to show you is this, the real one.
[15416.82s -> 15418.82s]  First of all, get fucking ice cubes in there.
[15418.82s -> 15420.82s]  Flip it up there. Flip it vodka, I'm talking about
[15420.82s -> 15426.19s]  about 40 milliliters.
[15426.19s -> 15428.19s]  Grab yourself a soda can here. Snap it off.
[15428.19s -> 15430.19s]  Bingo. Throw it up.
[15430.19s -> 15434.93s]  Best of the way. That's enough.
[15434.93s -> 15436.93s]  Get it out of there. Grab the cranberry. Get it in there too.
[15436.93s -> 15438.93s]  This is like a vodka soda cranberry.
[15438.93s -> 15440.93s]  Grab a lime.
[15440.93s -> 15442.93s]  A couple of them actually.
[15442.93s -> 15449.78s]  You can forego the lime if you want.
[15449.78s -> 15451.78s]  Grab a straw.
[15451.78s -> 15453.78s]  Finish it off with some crushed ice.
[15453.78s -> 15457.54s]  There you go. Order up!
[15457.54s -> 15481.98s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[15481.98s -> 15484.86s]  Okay. Here's another one.
[15484.86s -> 15487.30s]  You can impress some of your friends at a party
[15487.30s -> 15489.30s]  if you do this one. First of all, you get a glass.
[15489.30s -> 15492.94s]  You want to fill it up with
[15492.94s -> 15494.94s]  orange zest. The whole thing.
[15494.94s -> 15498.02s]  This takes like the skin of probably
[15498.02s -> 15500.02s]  four or five oranges.
[15500.02s -> 15548.38s]  Get about a hundred. And then you put a little bit
[15548.38s -> 15551.78s]  of orange juice in there.
[15551.78s -> 15553.78s]  Just enough to get it so you know it gets happy.
[15553.78s -> 15555.78s]  Grab the squisher. Squish it.
[15555.78s -> 15561.98s]  Then you got a little orange
[15561.98s -> 15564.35s]  puree in here.
[15564.35s -> 15566.35s]  And then what you want to do is you want to go to the
[15566.35s -> 15568.59s]  Do you have any milk?
[15568.59s -> 15571.60s]  Just pretend this is
[15571.60s -> 15573.60s]  Or you can use heavy cream too.
[15573.60s -> 15575.60s]  Just pretend this is heavy cream.
[15575.60s -> 15579.12s]  Put like seventy-three milliliters of heavy cream
[15579.12s -> 15581.12s]  in there. That's when you want to get it shaken up.
[15581.12s -> 15583.12s]  You want to stir it a little.
[15583.12s -> 15588.99s]  Okay. Now
[15588.99s -> 15591.42s]  you want sugar syrup.
[15591.42s -> 15595.39s]  Which is right here. Just enough.
[15595.39s -> 15597.39s]  Okay. Now you want crushed ice.
[15597.39s -> 15600.91s]  It's important that it's the crushed ice
[15600.91s -> 15606.03s]  because you're going to do something here.
[15606.03s -> 15608.03s]  Get that full up. Just that's pretty good.
[15608.03s -> 15610.03s]  Now we're going to add a little bit of vodka.
[15610.03s -> 15613.68s]  Just enough to the rim. About
[15613.68s -> 15615.68s]  thirty milliliters. Stir it up again.
[15615.68s -> 15622.34s]  So it gets all happy and all crushed up
[15622.34s -> 15624.96s]  Okay. Now what you're going to do is
[15624.96s -> 15626.96s]  you're going to grab a little orange puree.
[15626.96s -> 15628.96s]  Grab yourself a
[15628.96s -> 15631.14s]  just another little orange with a cherry
[15631.14s -> 15633.14s]  just to get on there so it looks nice.
[15633.14s -> 15646.51s]  And I like to do
[15646.51s -> 15649.39s]  usually you share this.
[15649.39s -> 15651.39s]  Okay. Well forget about that.
[15651.39s -> 15658.22s]  I call this one the orange
[15658.22s -> 15660.22s]  creamsicle dream.
[15660.22s -> 15663.74s]  Bon Appetit.
[15663.74s -> 15669.06s]  Just awful.
[15669.06s -> 15671.87s]  This next one I'm going to show you.
[15671.87s -> 15673.87s]  Get yourself a few glasses.
[15673.87s -> 15680.45s]  Get a little bit of vodka.
[15680.45s -> 15682.45s]  Across all the glasses. This is important.
[15682.45s -> 15684.75s]  I need some more glasses
[15684.75s -> 15689.81s]  though. This one goes up here.
[15689.81s -> 15695.82s]  Oh. Well I guess I can't do that.
[15695.82s -> 15697.82s]  Never mind. I'll just line them up the way I had them before.
[15697.82s -> 15701.02s]  I've got the ice in all of my vodka
[15701.02s -> 15703.02s]  in all three of them.
[15703.02s -> 15705.90s]  Okay. A little bit of Prosecco.
[15705.90s -> 15712.11s]  Okay. Then we're going to top it off
[15712.11s -> 15714.11s]  with some cream soda.
[15714.11s -> 15719.10s]  To give it a little kick at the end.
[15719.10s -> 15723.78s]  This is like five or six
[15723.78s -> 15725.78s]  customers out here watching this. You know what I mean?
[15725.78s -> 15728.98s]  You want to leave a little bit of room
[15728.98s -> 15730.98s]  because
[15730.98s -> 15732.98s]  nobody wants a full drink
[15732.98s -> 15734.98s]  stuffed in their mouth.
[15734.98s -> 15736.98s]  And then what you do after this is you stand back
[15736.98s -> 15738.98s]  as the bartender
[15738.98s -> 15740.98s]  and this one is called
[15740.98s -> 15742.98s]  the ball throwing midway game that nobody
[15742.98s -> 15746.30s]  can beat.
[15746.30s -> 15748.30s]  You've got to get it right in the middle.
[15748.30s -> 15750.48s]  It's kind of gritty.
[15750.48s -> 15755.41s]  But I don't think it worked.
[15755.41s -> 15758.67s]  Ah. Well I almost got it.
[15758.67s -> 15766.72s]  More!
[15766.72s -> 15768.72s]  Imagine throwing a fucking baseball
[15768.72s -> 15770.72s]  right in the middle of that.
[15770.72s -> 15772.72s]  Alright. This next one is called
[15772.72s -> 15774.72s]  Gerber
[15774.72s -> 15778.69s]  ran out of stuff to do in the game
[15778.69s -> 15780.69s]  because the game is really just kind of a giant
[15780.69s -> 15788.24s]  tutorial. How can I ruin this?
[15788.24s -> 15790.24s]  How do I ruin the whole thing?
[15790.24s -> 15801.44s]  What you do is you take the fucking
[15801.44s -> 15805.07s]  get it all over there
[15805.07s -> 15807.07s]  and all over the fucking bar.
[15807.07s -> 15809.89s]  You say, oh yeah, oh yeah
[15809.89s -> 15811.89s]  Rachel, oh what a sunny day, huh?
[15811.89s -> 15824.29s]  Well that was fun.
[15824.29s -> 15834.98s]  Fire this van.
[15834.98s -> 15836.98s]  Yeah, yeah, I moved here
[15836.98s -> 15838.98s]  in fucking October.
[15838.98s -> 15840.98s]  It was fucking fun.
[15840.98s -> 15842.98s]  Oh, what's that? What's that? Oh.
[15842.98s -> 15844.98s]  You do business out here.
[15844.98s -> 15846.98s]  Oh, that's wonderful.
[15846.98s -> 15851.07s]  Oh, you and your wife?
[15851.07s -> 15853.89s]  That's just great, man.
[15853.89s -> 15855.89s]  What did you want? You wanted cranberry, right?
[15855.89s -> 15857.89s]  You wanted cranberry mule? Yeah.
[15857.89s -> 15863.01s]  Yeah, I'm sure that's great.
[15863.01s -> 15865.01s]  You guys are all having a great time like partying here.
[15865.01s -> 15867.01s]  And I fucking have to live here, you know.
[15867.01s -> 15870.21s]  I heard about your room, by the way.
[15870.21s -> 15873.02s]  Guys, like
[15873.02s -> 15875.02s]  screaming and yelling past
[15875.02s -> 15877.46s]  4am.
[15877.46s -> 15879.46s]  I'm not sure you know that there's other guests here at this
[15879.46s -> 15891.87s]  hotel and resort.
[15891.87s -> 15894.50s]  All five of you. All five of you.
[15894.50s -> 15899.87s]  You're probably wondering,
[15899.87s -> 15901.87s]  oh wait, no, no, this one's for me.
[15901.87s -> 15904.56s]  Here you go
[15904.56s -> 15906.56s]  fucking Greg, Dan,
[15906.56s -> 15908.56s]  Jake, Barry,
[15908.56s -> 15910.56s]  and Tim. Yeah, all of that.
[15910.56s -> 15912.56s]  Cheers to all of us, right? You're on
[15912.56s -> 15914.56s]  vacation, goddamn it, not me.
[15914.56s -> 15919.17s]  Alright, I gotta get out of this game.
[15919.17s -> 15924.86s]  You come out here,
[15924.86s -> 15926.86s]  you fucking make a ton of noise,
[15926.86s -> 15929.49s]  you be loud and
[15929.49s -> 15931.49s]  annoying, you have your goddamn boat out there.
[15931.49s -> 15936.80s]  Sell that thing.
[15936.80s -> 15938.80s]  Sell that thing and build a fucking school!
[15938.80s -> 15941.30s]  Fucking assholes!
[15941.30s -> 15957.47s]  Alright, let's go.
[15957.47s -> 15959.47s]  He's going full
[15959.47s -> 15961.90s]  socialist.
[15961.90s -> 15965.87s]  He's got
[15965.87s -> 15970.42s]  a fridge shared
[15970.42s -> 15972.42s]  up.
[15974.78s -> 15978.11s]  Alright,
[15978.11s -> 15980.11s]  I think that's where I'm gonna call it.
[15980.11s -> 15983.63s]  I'm exhausted. It's pretty much
[15983.63s -> 15985.63s]  the exact same amount of time as last time,
[15985.63s -> 15989.09s]  like four and a half hours.
[15989.09s -> 15991.09s]  I'm like fucking beat right now. Beat saver
[15991.09s -> 15993.09s]  like just took the whole rest of the
[15993.09s -> 15997.50s]  night all out of me.
[15997.50s -> 15999.50s]  So, here's the question. I'm gonna turn off
[15999.50s -> 16003.66s]  this music. I got a question for
[16003.66s -> 16006.16s]  you guys.
[16006.16s -> 16009.36s]  Are we dropping frames, I think? A little bit.
[16009.36s -> 16011.36s]  So, my question to you all
[16011.36s -> 16013.98s]  is, let's get that off
[16013.98s -> 16017.89s]  screen for a minute.
[16017.89s -> 16026.66s]  Hey, it's me. Remember the person
[16026.66s -> 16028.66s]  that said that they get really bad anxiety when I
[16028.66s -> 16033.90s]  take this off?
[16033.90s -> 16035.90s]  This is like intent, holy shit.
[16035.90s -> 16038.14s]  This is like intentional.
[16038.14s -> 16042.61s]  So,
[16042.61s -> 16044.61s]  I am not gonna be streaming for the next day or two.
[16044.61s -> 16046.85s]  I'll be back.
[16046.85s -> 16048.85s]  Because I did want to do three days
[16048.85s -> 16050.85s]  in a row. And we did three days in a row here.
[16050.85s -> 16053.09s]  And I'm pro-
[16053.09s -> 16055.09s]  Do you guys want me to come back with more VR?
[16055.09s -> 16057.09s]  Or do you want me to like pivot away for a little while?
[16057.09s -> 16059.09s]  What do you think? I still fucking love it.
[16059.09s -> 16065.74s]  Yes, yes. More, more, more.
[16065.74s -> 16070.03s]  Yes. More, please.
[16070.03s -> 16072.03s]  Yeah, there's so much more to
[16072.03s -> 16074.03s]  do. I have
[16074.03s -> 16076.03s]  a list. A very long one.
[16076.03s -> 16084.35s]  Alright. So, I'm gonna leave
[16084.35s -> 16086.35s]  the room set up the way it is, but I'm gonna take like
[16086.35s -> 16088.35s]  a couple days. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[16088.35s -> 16090.35s]  So, I can't really-
[16090.35s -> 16092.35s]  It's tomorrow afternoon.
[16092.35s -> 16094.35s]  And then the day after that, I have some
[16094.35s -> 16096.35s]  house stuff that I'd like to get done.
[16096.35s -> 16098.35s]  So, you won't see me for probably two days.
[16098.35s -> 16100.35s]  I'll come back here and we'll do some more VR.
[16100.35s -> 16104.26s]  But, this is fucking a lot of fun.
[16104.26s -> 16106.62s]  What a blast.
[16106.62s -> 16108.62s]  I just wish I had the stamina to do it for more
[16108.62s -> 16110.99s]  than like five hours.
[16110.99s -> 16116.82s]  Ah, is it a-
[16116.82s -> 16119.25s]  Dude, okay, I just-
[16119.25s -> 16121.25s]  This is why you gotta take breaks.
[16121.25s -> 16123.25s]  In this space here. Look at what just
[16123.25s -> 16125.25s]  happened. I just tried to place my
[16125.25s -> 16127.25s]  glass on my desk.
[16127.25s -> 16129.25s]  And I like went too far and almost dropped it.
[16129.25s -> 16131.25s]  This is why, like, you gotta
[16131.25s -> 16137.07s]  spend some time in the real world.
[16137.07s -> 16139.44s]  But, I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[16139.44s -> 16141.44s]  We're gonna pivot to the bits. Thanks for joining me.
[16141.44s -> 16144.90s]  I've had a lot of fun the last few days.
[16144.90s -> 16148.48s]  I just can only
[16148.48s -> 16150.48s]  do it for so long before I have to go
[16150.48s -> 16156.82s]  like take a shower. If you spend
[16156.82s -> 16158.82s]  too long in VR, you're gonna get stuck there.
[16158.82s -> 16164.83s]  That's what happens when you practice
[16164.83s -> 16166.83s]  throwing and breaking
[16166.83s -> 16170.22s]  glasses. I was really throwing
[16170.22s -> 16172.22s]  them too. I was really trying to throw
[16172.22s -> 16174.22s]  those with weight behind
[16174.22s -> 16178.96s]  them. Superhot VR was incredible.
[16178.96s -> 16180.96s]  Beat Saber, obviously, a ton of fun.
[16180.96s -> 16184.74s]  And we're gonna go to the bits.
[16184.74s -> 16187.04s]  For those of you that are maybe new
[16187.04s -> 16189.04s]  to the stream, I don't read
[16189.04s -> 16191.04s]  bits during a stream. Or subs.
[16191.04s -> 16193.04s]  We do like a bit reading segment
[16193.04s -> 16195.66s]  where we wind down at the end.
[16195.66s -> 16197.97s]  That's exactly what we're about to do right now.
[16197.97s -> 16204.11s]  First time viewer here.
[16204.11s -> 16209.28s]  But, thanks again.
[16209.28s -> 16211.28s]  If you want something, if you want to see something in VR,
[16211.28s -> 16213.58s]  I highly recommend you go to the discord
[16213.58s -> 16216.08s]  and put
[16216.08s -> 16218.08s]  40 months from
[16218.08s -> 16220.45s]  Leatherjacket. Oh my god.
[16220.45s -> 16222.45s]  If you want some certain VR games, I know
[16222.45s -> 16224.69s]  Gorn is on the list. That's like
[16224.69s -> 16226.69s]  another one that I really want to play. There's like two or three others
[16226.69s -> 16228.69s]  that I really want to play.
[16228.69s -> 16230.69s]  But please go to the recommended channel. I'll look at them over
[16230.69s -> 16232.99s]  the course of the next couple days.
[16232.99s -> 16237.47s]  We'll see what we can do. But let's go
[16237.47s -> 16241.50s]  back to earlier, about
[16241.50s -> 16244.64s]  five hours ago. We had five
[16244.64s -> 16246.64s]  dollars come in from Miss Melon T.
[16246.64s -> 16249.07s]  Five bucks. Thank you so much, Miss Melon T.
[16249.07s -> 16251.07s]  Hey, Jerma, I ordered the Night Sky shirt the minute
[16251.07s -> 16253.07s]  it was announced. Still waiting
[16253.07s -> 16255.07s]  for it to get here since I'm all the way in Australia.
[16255.07s -> 16257.07s]  But I love the design so much, I was
[16257.07s -> 16259.07s]  inspired to remake it completely from scratch
[16259.07s -> 16261.07s]  in pixel art.
[16261.07s -> 16263.70s]  As well as adding a few extra stuff.
[16263.70s -> 16265.70s]  Hope you both and chat
[16265.70s -> 16268.32s]  like it. That's
[16268.32s -> 16270.82s]  fucking awesome. Let's see.
[16270.82s -> 16272.82s]  That is so
[16272.82s -> 16277.23s]  cool. That's awesome.
[16277.23s -> 16279.41s]  Unfortunately, Jerma Mercury
[16279.41s -> 16281.41s]  is not on that shirt, and neither is Saturn.
[16281.41s -> 16283.41s]  So you added those other planets.
[16283.41s -> 16286.99s]  Those planets got voted off.
[16286.99s -> 16290.70s]  Well, nicely done.
[16290.70s -> 16294.78s]  Thank you.
[16294.78s -> 16296.96s]  I'll get out of this. I'm still like
[16296.96s -> 16298.96s]  in the program here.
[16298.96s -> 16302.02s]  I think I need to go like this.
[16302.02s -> 16304.58s]  Okay, there we go.
[16304.58s -> 16310.40s]  I'm the best emote.
[16310.40s -> 16313.28s]  There we are.
[16313.28s -> 16317.57s]  Now I can see.
[16317.57s -> 16319.57s]  But thank you for the five dollars as well.
[16319.57s -> 16321.74s]  Binary Man, thanks for five bucks,
[16321.74s -> 16323.74s]  Binary Man. I'm honestly so sorry,
[16323.74s -> 16325.74s]  Jerma, I really am. Please don't hate me for
[16325.74s -> 16328.43s]  this. Don't hate me for this.
[16328.43s -> 16332.98s]  This is a video called The Pinnacle of Gamers.
[16332.98s -> 16336.94s]  Let me get it on here.
[16336.94s -> 16341.74s]  I'm sorry. God damn it.
[16341.74s -> 16343.74s]  I'm so close to the vibe is still
[16343.74s -> 16345.74s]  over here. I just like probably blew out somebody's ears. I'm really
[16345.74s -> 16350.35s]  sorry. That was like
[16350.35s -> 16355.60s]  an explosion.
[16355.60s -> 16362.70s]  Is this gonna play?
[16362.70s -> 16367.49s]  Okay, here we go.
[16367.49s -> 16389.76s]  This is called The Pinnacle of Gamers.
[16389.76s -> 16391.76s]  Did you speed this up or was I actually doing that?
[16391.76s -> 16394.90s]  What the fuck did you do that for?
[16394.90s -> 16396.90s]  Oh my god.
[16396.90s -> 16413.02s]  Oh, you dick.
[16413.02s -> 16415.90s]  You dick.
[16415.90s -> 16418.59s]  You fucking dick.
[16418.59s -> 16420.59s]  Alright, I'm telling you, I like to play videos
[16420.59s -> 16422.77s]  that people send me, but I'm gonna be
[16422.77s -> 16427.76s]  real frank with you here.
[16427.76s -> 16429.76s]  Don't pee in the soup. Do not piss
[16429.76s -> 16435.14s]  in the soup. Otherwise they're gonna have to get
[16435.14s -> 16442.37s]  pre-screened. If you don't know what I'm talking about,
[16442.37s -> 16446.46s]  if one guy pisses in the soup, nobody can eat it.
[16446.46s -> 16448.46s]  Link the video? I'm not gonna link that video.
[16448.46s -> 16460.18s]  That's too loud. Who was that?
[16460.18s -> 16462.54s]  I'm really sorry for this.
[16462.54s -> 16464.54s]  Well, I'm really sorry for like the
[16464.54s -> 16481.18s]  three day ban you're about to get.
[16481.18s -> 16483.18s]  Show no mercy. I can't show mercy
[16483.18s -> 16486.38s]  on that one. You're not streaming
[16486.38s -> 16488.38s]  until then. Yes, I am.
[16488.38s -> 16492.29s]  I'm streaming on the third day.
[16492.29s -> 16494.29s]  He's getting suspended from school before a vacation.
[16494.29s -> 16496.46s]  Don't worry.
[16496.46s -> 16502.54s]  Don't do that shit.
[16502.54s -> 16505.36s]  Really, come on. Don't make me have
[16505.36s -> 16507.36s]  to fucking change that policy because you want
[16507.36s -> 16509.36s]  to blow out everybody's ear drums.
[16509.36s -> 16520.62s]  One guy.
[16520.62s -> 16524.08s]  But anyways,
[16524.08s -> 16526.08s]  thank you Soup or Seal for the $2.50.
[16526.08s -> 16532.10s]  I do that to you guys all
[16532.10s -> 16534.10s]  the time. But mine's not intentional
[16534.10s -> 16538.26s]  and they're never that loud.
[16538.26s -> 16540.26s]  Any time I accidentally blow out ear drums is because
[16540.26s -> 16542.26s]  like a game setting is too high.
[16542.26s -> 16545.07s]  Or I open up a game for the first time and it's loud.
[16545.07s -> 16547.07s]  That was like, I'm gonna put it to red.
[16547.07s -> 16558.08s]  As loud as possible.
[16558.08s -> 16560.08s]  My dad's not mad. He's disappointed.
[16560.08s -> 16563.47s]  No, I'm good. I did like the video
[16563.47s -> 16568.46s]  up until the last tenth of a second.
[16568.46s -> 16570.46s]  But thank you Soup or Seal for the $2.50.
[16570.46s -> 16572.46s]  Here's an MS Paint drawing of you as a coal miner.
[16572.46s -> 16580.51s]  Jesus.
[16580.51s -> 16582.51s]  I hope you like it. Thank you Soup or Seal
[16582.51s -> 16589.04s]  for the $2.50.
[16589.04s -> 16591.60s]  God, that makes me look like a zombie
[16591.60s -> 16593.60s]  from a Resident Evil game. I look fucking
[16593.60s -> 16598.08s]  terrible. Look at that lower
[16598.08s -> 16600.08s]  right corner. Look at that Resident
[16600.08s -> 16602.08s]  Evil. I'm about to turn
[16602.08s -> 16604.08s]  45 year old man.
[16604.08s -> 16610.42s]  Rude? No, I'm not talking
[16610.42s -> 16612.42s]  about the drawing. I'm talking about me.
[16612.42s -> 16625.15s]  My actual face. That's the cover
[16625.15s -> 16627.15s]  of a horror novel. Yeah, that's like the scary
[16627.15s -> 16631.95s]  stories. Oh my goodness.
[16631.95s -> 16633.95s]  But that's
[16633.95s -> 16636.69s]  fucking awesome.
[16636.69s -> 16638.69s]  Thank you for the fucking
[16638.69s -> 16641.06s]  coal miner. I don't have
[16641.06s -> 16645.92s]  my eyes. Why do I have
[16645.92s -> 16650.72s]  no eyes?
[16650.72s -> 16652.72s]  But thank you. Thank you Alec
[16652.72s -> 16654.72s]  for the $1. How's a nice chicken
[16654.72s -> 16657.15s]  sandwich sound? Actually sounds pretty good.
[16657.15s -> 16662.90s]  Sounds pretty good. Thank you
[16662.90s -> 16665.14s]  for the $1. Thank you
[16665.14s -> 16667.14s]  Magellan for the five community subs
[16667.14s -> 16669.44s]  earlier. Beginning of the stream. Thank you
[16669.44s -> 16672.06s]  so much. Hey Divus, thanks for two bucks.
[16672.06s -> 16674.24s]  Two bucks from Divus, that's it.
[16674.24s -> 16676.24s]  Freudian weapon, thanks for the $2.50.
[16676.24s -> 16678.24s]  Your aiming is impeccable
[16678.24s -> 16680.24s]  as always, Jerma checks.
[16680.24s -> 16684.64s]  From Superhot. I feel like
[16684.64s -> 16688.93s]  it did okay. Maybe
[16688.93s -> 16690.93s]  like after 45 minutes or so.
[16690.93s -> 16696.37s]  I thought I was doing pretty good.
[16696.37s -> 16705.20s]  Check the chat link. Manhole
[16705.20s -> 16708.53s]  cover. Vocal streamer rescue
[16708.53s -> 16710.53s]  from Vegas sewer claims faulty
[16710.53s -> 16712.53s]  room scale.
[16712.53s -> 16716.18s]  Alright,
[16716.18s -> 16718.18s]  I'm not gonna lie, I thought the thing in the top left
[16718.18s -> 16720.18s]  was a pizza or a waffle.
[16720.18s -> 16723.70s]  And then I realized, wait,
[16723.70s -> 16729.58s]  that's a sewer cover.
[16729.58s -> 16733.49s]  That's so great. But thank you
[16733.49s -> 16735.49s]  Freudian for the $2.50. Thank you Nate
[16735.49s -> 16737.49s]  for the $1. Hey Jerma, I saw an old
[16737.49s -> 16739.49s]  Twitter post with your Sega CD
[16739.49s -> 16741.49s]  that has a Sega Genesis on the right.
[16741.49s -> 16744.50s]  Do I still have it? I do
[16744.50s -> 16749.60s]  not. I do not.
[16749.60s -> 16751.60s]  Unfortunately the Sega CD and Genesis are both
[16751.60s -> 16756.32s]  gone, but thank you. Thank you
[16756.32s -> 16758.32s]  Smashly for the ten community
[16758.32s -> 16762.35s]  subs. Ten coming in from Smashly.
[16762.35s -> 16766.06s]  Thank you. It's a lot of
[16766.06s -> 16768.88s]  subs to give.
[16768.88s -> 16770.88s]  But it's unfortunate, talking
[16770.88s -> 16772.88s]  about the Sega, Sega was it?
[16772.88s -> 16774.88s]  Not Dreamcast. The CD.
[16774.88s -> 16777.12s]  I actually came across like three
[16777.12s -> 16779.12s]  or four more Sega CD games that I really
[16779.12s -> 16781.62s]  want to play. I'm so disappointed
[16781.62s -> 16783.62s]  that I couldn't bring it with me in the move. I gave
[16783.62s -> 16785.62s]  it away and I don't have it anymore
[16785.62s -> 16787.98s]  and I'm like, I want to play the Cliff
[16787.98s -> 16793.10s]  Hanger game. I might have to get
[16793.10s -> 16797.39s]  another one. But
[16797.39s -> 16799.63s]  we'll see about that. Ask for
[16799.63s -> 16801.63s]  it back? I can't ask
[16801.63s -> 16807.97s]  for it back. Hey thank you Freudian Weapon for
[16807.97s -> 16809.97s]  the $2.50. Where is my venti
[16809.97s -> 16813.55s]  soy latte? Talking about my hair.
[16813.55s -> 16817.97s]  Talking about my hair.
[16817.97s -> 16821.36s]  Theo Mighty Bob
[16821.36s -> 16824.37s]  thanks for the two bucks. Freudian Weapon thanks
[16824.37s -> 16827.18s]  for the $2.50. This stream has been
[16827.18s -> 16829.18s]  amazing man. I don't care if the VOD is deleted
[16829.18s -> 16831.18s]  or muted. Hope you had a blast. Cause I
[16831.18s -> 16835.28s]  sure as hell did. Rock on sir.
[16835.28s -> 16837.28s]  Yeah, as much as I, I mean I
[16837.28s -> 16839.28s]  only complained about how small my room was once.
[16839.28s -> 16841.65s]  It was a very flash
[16841.65s -> 16843.65s]  rage. It wasn't really that. I wasn't
[16843.65s -> 16846.78s]  really angry. It's been a phenomenal
[16846.78s -> 16849.73s]  experience so far. The VOD is going to
[16849.73s -> 16852.16s]  get hit horribly though. So
[16852.16s -> 16854.16s]  unfortunately there's not much I can do about
[16854.16s -> 16859.47s]  that. But thank you Freudian. It was a blast.
[16859.47s -> 16862.80s]  Hope you had a good time too. Sticks Renegade
[16862.80s -> 16864.80s]  thanks for the $2.45. Do
[16864.80s -> 16866.80s]  all the single furries.
[16866.80s -> 16871.54s]  I'm not going to play all the single
[16871.54s -> 16876.66s]  furries on Beat Saber. Thank you
[16876.66s -> 16878.66s]  Nate for the $1
[16878.66s -> 16880.66s]  and Bozak for the $1 back to
[16880.66s -> 16883.73s]  back here. It's a me channel
[16883.73s -> 16885.73s]  theme. Too bad it was all shut down.
[16885.73s -> 16888.85s]  That's true. That's very true.
[16888.85s -> 16892.62s]  Hey JelloX, thanks for the
[16892.62s -> 16895.18s]  $2.50. Hey Jerbo, going to
[16895.18s -> 16897.18s]  Navy Bootcamp in two days. Thanks for
[16897.18s -> 16899.18s]  all the entertainment. Hopefully I can catch the streams
[16899.18s -> 16902.13s]  sometime soon. I wish you
[16902.13s -> 16910.58s]  the best of luck. Good luck to you. Hopefully we can see you
[16910.58s -> 16913.20s]  again real soon. Thank you so much
[16913.20s -> 16917.47s]  for being around. Good luck.
[16917.47s -> 16924.32s]  Yeah, hopefully we can see you again soon.
[16924.32s -> 16933.47s]  And thank you so much for the $2.50.
[16933.47s -> 16939.04s]  Bozak came in with another $3.00.
[16939.04s -> 16941.28s]  They say PogChamp.
[16941.28s -> 16943.78s]  Jermo for Super Bowl Halftime Show
[16943.78s -> 16946.14s]  2020. Oh, because of Sweet Victory.
[16946.14s -> 16951.07s]  Thank you so much for the
[16951.07s -> 16954.59s]  $3.00 Bozak and Jero. What did I get for a
[16954.59s -> 16956.77s]  grade on that one? That one got hard.
[16956.77s -> 16959.58s]  A lot of different
[16959.58s -> 16962.08s]  angle changes in the middle.
[16962.08s -> 16968.10s]  Thank you Nate again for $2.00.
[16968.10s -> 16970.10s]  Sweet Victory. Do you hate the NFL for what they
[16970.10s -> 16973.04s]  did to Spongebob?
[16973.04s -> 16976.24s]  I mean the halftime show is
[16976.24s -> 16978.24s]  unfortunate, but the halftime show usually is just
[16978.24s -> 16980.54s]  they just get like a bunch of actors
[16980.54s -> 16982.54s]  to come show up in the front row and dance
[16982.54s -> 16984.54s]  around and they do some songs.
[16984.54s -> 16988.51s]  So I mean,
[16988.51s -> 16990.51s]  some Super Bowl halftime shows are
[16990.51s -> 16997.09s]  really good. I mean,
[16997.09s -> 16999.09s]  I guess if you bring in Spongebob
[16999.09s -> 17001.09s]  for three seconds, you can't even give him
[17001.09s -> 17006.59s]  like ten. You can't even give Spongebob
[17006.59s -> 17008.59s]  like fifteen seconds.
[17008.59s -> 17017.02s]  What can you do? I think that was
[17017.02s -> 17019.02s]  probably the best Super Bowl halftime show.
[17019.02s -> 17021.02s]  It was probably Bruno Mars.
[17021.02s -> 17024.42s]  He did it, what, like three or four years ago?
[17024.42s -> 17027.36s]  He went fucking hard.
[17027.36s -> 17032.03s]  He played like every instrument.
[17032.03s -> 17035.81s]  It was very, very well done.
[17035.81s -> 17037.81s]  You can't have a Super Bowl halftime show ever again
[17037.81s -> 17039.81s]  when Bruno Mars put on that show.
[17039.81s -> 17044.03s]  Michael Jackson too from way back.
[17044.03s -> 17046.03s]  Well I'm talking like recently, the last like ten years.
[17046.03s -> 17048.21s]  Last like five to ten years.
[17048.21s -> 17053.82s]  Prince, yeah.
[17053.82s -> 17055.82s]  It's really good Super Bowl halftime shows.
[17055.82s -> 17066.11s]  Janet Jackson, oh yeah.
[17066.11s -> 17068.11s]  But in very recent memory,
[17068.11s -> 17070.11s]  I remember Bruno Mars was ridiculous.
[17070.11s -> 17073.38s]  He was like
[17073.38s -> 17075.38s]  singing and moving around and doing all these awesome
[17075.38s -> 17077.38s]  choreography. Then he went and like sat down at a drum set
[17077.38s -> 17079.87s]  and just played like a fucking whole
[17079.87s -> 17081.87s]  drum solo and was singing still.
[17081.87s -> 17084.05s]  It was like, how the hell are you this
[17084.05s -> 17091.79s]  talented? How could you do that?
[17091.79s -> 17094.16s]  It was great. But thank you
[17094.16s -> 17096.16s]  Gapsy for this one.
[17096.16s -> 17098.46s]  The one dollar. Do the pirate spy
[17098.46s -> 17100.46s]  song. I didn't catch it, unfortunately.
[17100.46s -> 17105.46s]  He played Beat Saber.
[17105.46s -> 17109.92s]  I did.
[17109.92s -> 17111.92s]  Ninety percent of that show was lip synced.
[17111.92s -> 17113.92s]  Here's something you guys need to understand
[17113.92s -> 17115.92s]  about songs, right?
[17115.92s -> 17117.92s]  Okay, I'm going to show you something.
[17117.92s -> 17120.61s]  The reason why they lip sync
[17120.61s -> 17123.04s]  all those songs
[17123.04s -> 17125.04s]  is because when you go like this
[17125.04s -> 17127.04s]  when you're like jumping and fucking
[17127.04s -> 17129.04s]  throwing your hands everywhere, like kicking
[17129.04s -> 17132.24s]  and shit. Okay, let's
[17132.24s -> 17134.54s]  make up a song here. It's going to be called
[17134.54s -> 17136.54s]  like Let's Get To It
[17136.54s -> 17138.54s]  Let's Get With It, right? That's like the name
[17138.54s -> 17140.78s]  of the song. And it's like
[17140.78s -> 17142.78s]  bang, bang, like let's get to it
[17142.78s -> 17144.78s]  let's get with it. So I'm going to
[17144.78s -> 17146.78s]  show you how hard that is to do while you like
[17146.78s -> 17148.78s]  fucking throwing your arms around, moving around.
[17148.78s -> 17150.78s]  Let's get with it. Let's get to it.
[17150.78s -> 17153.02s]  You can't, it's not impossible.
[17153.02s -> 17155.02s]  You're like, it's not
[17155.02s -> 17159.06s]  you can't do it. So what they do is they just
[17159.06s -> 17161.06s]  lip sync and they have like a thing go over.
[17161.06s -> 17163.06s]  So it sounds like the song that you like
[17163.06s -> 17166.64s]  that you've heard before.
[17166.64s -> 17168.64s]  If you're like jumping and like swinging around
[17168.64s -> 17170.64s]  you're going to sound all fucked up.
[17170.64s -> 17183.38s]  It's called vocal training?
[17183.38s -> 17185.62s]  Beyonce does it?
[17185.62s -> 17192.51s]  Alright, but like
[17192.51s -> 17195.39s]  can you explain
[17195.39s -> 17198.40s]  Broadway? Broadway is
[17198.40s -> 17210.56s]  they're all
[17210.56s -> 17212.56s]  they are c- in the world at like .96
[17212.56s -> 17215.63s]  speed. You know what I'm saying? But the rest of
[17215.63s -> 17218.98s]  us. Alright I'm wrong, I
[17218.98s -> 17220.98s]  admit that I'm wrong. But I'm not though
[17220.98s -> 17226.04s]  because it's hard. I'll admit that I'm wrong.
[17226.04s -> 17236.02s]  That's okay. Sometimes
[17236.02s -> 17239.16s]  you're wrong, but like
[17239.16s -> 17241.16s]  99.9999.9 percent
[17241.16s -> 17243.16s]  of the time, I'm right.
[17243.16s -> 17245.33s]  I'll take one,
[17245.33s -> 17247.33s]  I said something wrong or incorrect
[17247.33s -> 17249.33s]  at 650
[17249.33s -> 17250.53s]  5,000 times that I've
[17250.53s -> 17265.03s]  ever said anything correct. I would put my bet on that horse the first time he's ever been wrong.
[17267.51s -> 17275.94s]  I wouldn't. Neither would I. That's that's like a bet that you you'd get paid a shitload from me
[17275.94s -> 17283.65s]  saying something correct, but you'd be you'd be risking your money a lot. That's a very high
[17283.65s -> 17292.88s]  risk investment, but thank you to... I don't even remember how that started. Oh right,
[17292.96s -> 17303.68s]  Bozak for the three dollars. Thank you. No, that was... what the hell? How did I get on that?
[17303.68s -> 17309.17s]  I don't remember. But Freudian Weapon, it was Freudian Weapon was the one that gave fifty three
[17309.17s -> 17315.91s]  dollars. Fifty three dollars and fifty cents from Freudian Weapon. I heard it, but I couldn't come
[17315.91s -> 17323.48s]  out of the VR. I was stuck in there, but it was over 53 bucks. Thank you so much. They say,
[17323.48s -> 17329.04s]  hi it's me again derailing your stream. You're such a delight to watch. Love all that you do,
[17329.04s -> 17333.20s]  and you really do help brighten my day whenever I watch your streams or videos. So thanks so much
[17333.20s -> 17341.25s]  for keeping me going. Thank you, Freudian Weapon. I didn't derail the stream. I didn't really have
[17341.25s -> 17347.12s]  a chance to see it. It's not derailing the stream, by the way. If somebody drops like 50,
[17347.12s -> 17351.40s]  100 fucking bucks, it's okay to, you know, I just want to make sure that I don't miss it
[17351.40s -> 17363.86s]  because that's a lot of money. Oh, it's the Bruno Mars halftime show thing. Oh okay,
[17363.86s -> 17368.12s]  right, right, right. But thank you, Freudian Weapon. Much love to you. Thank you
[17368.68s -> 17374.90s]  for your huge amount of money. Purple rose tattoo. Thanks for the five bucks. You should do in
[17374.90s -> 17382.36s]  italics teaches germa how to play Civ stream. I would get bored out of my mind. I respect
[17382.36s -> 17390.40s]  those games. Civilization. What a great franchise, right? I could never sit down
[17390.40s -> 17402.36s]  and play those games. Ever. To me, it's a giant board game that lasts. They seem
[17402.36s -> 17406.10s]  interesting. They're really cool for what they are. It's just not something that I
[17406.10s -> 17412.55s]  would want to play. That's the kind of thing that I would watch over somebody's
[17412.55s -> 17418.15s]  shoulder and say, Oh, now what's going on over there? What's happening there?
[17418.15s -> 17422.34s]  Oh, well, you see, I'm taking the, uh, I'm taking these troops and moving over here
[17422.34s -> 17425.62s]  to this country and I got a diplomatic thing with that guy. So I can be careful
[17425.62s -> 17428.58s]  and she's coming back this way and I got a big diplomatic with her and I've got my
[17428.58s -> 17433.94s]  resources. I've got a coal. Uh, I've got VR coal. I've got wood and I just nodding.
[17433.94s -> 17439.04s]  I had just pretending. Oh yeah, no, no, that's cool. It's cool. Nice. Nice. So
[17439.04s -> 17443.51s]  how am I like, and I'm going to make, I'm going to ask a question that is me pretending
[17443.51s -> 17448.24s]  to what pretend to understand what I just heard. So when you get, uh, like 100 wood,
[17448.24s -> 17453.30s]  can you like turn that into something else or do you use that to build? I don't, I have no
[17453.30s -> 17456.18s]  idea what I'm talking about. I don't give a shit, but I'm just pretending that I do know
[17456.18s -> 17461.01s]  what I'm talking about. So who do you have selected for, uh, I know that like Gandhi's
[17461.01s -> 17466.12s]  in the game. Who is this Gandhi in this game? Now I'm pretending to know or understand what
[17466.12s -> 17478.37s]  I'm watching. I do that to everyone. I only do that in specific cases where someone's playing
[17478.37s -> 17489.38s]  civilization. I'm out of water and coffee. And that's a good thing because it's 9 PM
[17489.38s -> 17493.75s]  question marks at the end of everything you say. Yeah. Because then you can't be wrong.
[17495.75s -> 17502.72s]  Nothing you say is stupid. If you have a question mark at the end of your sentence.
[17502.72s -> 17508.36s]  So does a thousand wood give you something? Oh, I see. So those troops over there
[17509.48s -> 17516.37s]  are stronger than those troops that are next to them. You can never be wrong. And then
[17516.37s -> 17520.53s]  the person loves the loves that you just asked that question. And then they'll just
[17520.53s -> 17525.03s]  talk for like four or five straight minutes and you're having a pretend conversation with
[17525.03s -> 17544.85s]  somebody. It's really easy. What? My professor says every sentence like that.
[17546.56s -> 17549.52s]  That's because your professor, the professor knows that he can never be wrong when he does
[17549.52s -> 17555.51s]  that. If you want to challenge that professor, it's just like, I'm just posing the question.
[17558.07s -> 17562.23s]  That's for you to answer and you to understand and for us to come together
[17562.23s -> 17573.94s]  and get the question answered. Yoda. Now, but Civ is cool. Just not a fan of those kinds
[17573.94s -> 17580.42s]  of games. I'm not a big strategy player. Never have been, probably never will be.
[17584.36s -> 17587.40s]  It's some type of currency thing. I'm not sure. I use that really well.
[17587.96s -> 17594.47s]  Hey, future gamer. Thanks for the one dollar. Payday 2 VR has it so you can play with non-VR
[17594.47s -> 17602.16s]  users. An interesting stream idea. Really? That person's probably such a burden.
[17602.16s -> 17617.22s]  The person's probably so sloppy looking. But thank you to future gamer. Thank you.
[17617.94s -> 17623.62s]  For the two dollars and fifty cents. Jerma. You think you're gonna take me out that easy,
[17623.62s -> 17628.31s]  you scumbag? And then Star says, I've been waiting a long time for this. And I say,
[17628.31s -> 17635.20s]  Jerma. I say, come get it. And then Star says, my ride is going to whip your ass.
[17635.84s -> 17649.56s]  I say, Jerma, in your dreams. What the hell is this? Come get me, you streamer.
[17651.80s -> 17654.68s]  I don't know what that is, but thanks for the two dollars and fifty cents.
[17655.08s -> 17663.51s]  And some, there's a dialogue here between me, Star, and it's Helix. Thank you, though.
[17664.07s -> 17666.40s]  Frodian Weapon, thanks for the two dollars and fifty cents, Frodian.
[17667.04s -> 17669.92s]  These Beat Saber songs have been some of my favorites. How did you know?
[17670.48s -> 17673.60s]  But seriously though, I'm considering investing in a Vive and you aren't helping. This looks
[17673.60s -> 17684.45s]  so much fun. It is. I'm not going to pretend that that wasn't the last, that wasn't the most
[17684.53s -> 17694.68s]  fun I've had in a long time. Just in a pure video game sense, right? Well, I mean,
[17694.68s -> 17703.40s]  okay, Resident Evil 2 was amazing. It was a great experience. Start to finish. And then you got
[17703.40s -> 17712.15s]  super hot VR, Beat Saber, spells and sorcery, blade and sorcery, whatever. But man, if some
[17712.15s -> 17717.43s]  of those experiences aren't the most interesting, intense, and fun things I've done in probably
[17717.43s -> 17734.02s]  the last five years. Sorry if I am influencing a purchase, but it just is. You mean to tell
[17734.02s -> 17738.90s]  me that was fake excitement playing Africa? No, that was just a chill stream. We were just
[17738.90s -> 17745.83s]  chilling, taking pictures. I had an equally amount of fun time in that game. Just wasn't
[17745.83s -> 17752.58s]  the best thing I've ever done. But we see more Beat Saber. It was really fun to watch
[17752.58s -> 17761.41s]  you play. I don't see why not. Maybe I could like kind of warm up with VR with Beat Saber
[17761.49s -> 17775.94s]  and get a playlist or something. I don't, I'm not opposed to that. The next time I do VR,
[17775.94s -> 17781.51s]  whether it's two days from now or so, but not sit there for like an hour and a half or two
[17781.51s -> 17786.79s]  hours. I was in there for like an hour and a half. I would say probably warm up with it
[17786.79s -> 17797.51s]  for like 30 minutes. I am into it. But thank you, Frodeon. Thank you C4G for the $2.50.
[17798.72s -> 17805.78s]  Carly Rae Jepsen or I will cry will get it on the list. Here's the one unfortunate
[17805.78s -> 17813.04s]  thing about doing Beat Saber all the time. All the VODs will just get ruined. And maybe
[17813.04s -> 17817.84s]  that's something we should go out on rather than start with. Because there's a possibility
[17817.84s -> 17826.64s]  that it might kill the whole VOD. I don't know. I will have to look into that for real.
[17827.20s -> 17837.24s]  Carl, who's crying? We don't know. Oh, oh, oh, oh. But thanks for the $2.50. Hey Renix,
[17837.24s -> 17852.69s]  thanks for the $5. Do reptile theme from Mortal Kombat. He had his own theme? Did he?
[17852.69s -> 17859.44s]  How about that? Hey, thank you Superintendent Chalmers for the $1. Hey,
[17859.44s -> 17863.44s]  Jerma, next time you play Beat Saber, duct tape the controllers together and play
[17863.44s -> 17880.05s]  Duel of Fates. I would not be able to get the duct tape off. I would need some extra help
[17880.05s -> 17889.11s]  there. But thank you, Frodeon Weapon for the $2.50. Don't mind me. Just contributing to my
[17889.11s -> 17892.87s]  absolute favorite streamer. You stream to the highlight of my day, man. These past few have
[17892.87s -> 17902.50s]  been an absolute blast. Thanks so much. I've had a lot of fun. Three days in a row. It's
[17902.50s -> 17907.49s]  been great. And there's way more to look forward to. So we're gonna be doing it again.
[17909.04s -> 17920.98s]  Thank you, Frodeon. Slavik, thank you for the $4.00 SlavikGod. He says these drunk boys. Drunk?
[17920.98s -> 17931.30s]  I wasn't drunk. Maybe I was drunk in the head from being in the device for more than two or
[17931.30s -> 17938.47s]  three hours. But thank you Slavik for the $4.00. Busterboy, thanks for $1.00. Hey Jerma,
[17938.47s -> 17941.27s]  we're just gonna let you know earlier today I was telling myself I hope you don't play
[17941.27s -> 17946.15s]  Beat Saber because I really wanted to see it and I had to work. But you did it anyways.
[17946.15s -> 17954.12s]  Thanks. Well, I mean, I did say last night that my plan was to play it again today.
[17954.84s -> 17965.86s]  So I'm sorry, but I did. PaintedPotatoes, thanks for the $1.00 poop. Okay. GTX 1080 Quad
[17965.86s -> 17971.33s]  SLI, thanks for the $2.50. Hey Jerma, recently started watching you again, let me tell you.
[17971.97s -> 17975.65s]  I haven't laughed this hard in a while. The movie night was god tier and I can't wait for
[17975.65s -> 17981.19s]  the next one. Also, you should play Pavlov VR next time you stream. That would be great.
[17982.16s -> 17993.96s]  Also, could you say Nappy is epic. That would make his day. There you go. Thank you for the
[17993.96s -> 18011.62s]  $2.50. Pavlov is Counter-Strike in VR. I would get stomped. I would get absolutely destroyed.
[18012.26s -> 18017.72s]  I have a list though that I need to go through from recommendations and things that
[18017.72s -> 18026.42s]  I knew I wanted to play. I will play Vive as much as I need to, to get what I want out of it,
[18026.42s -> 18034.18s]  right? But thank you, GTX 1080. MultiTrip, thanks for the $2.50. If you had to die with
[18034.18s -> 18042.90s]  the Vive on, what VR game would you like to die inside? None of them. Die in the Vive.
[18045.35s -> 18053.56s]  I don't know. Revive the Human Simulator. It's a realistic, incredibly realistic being
[18053.56s -> 18067.30s]  revived simulator. Maybe it'll bring me back. I love that game. No, maybe I'll play it. Hey,
[18067.30s -> 18075.73s]  Topac. Thanks for the $5, Topac. I want to see Shito again. Show Shito. Shito is going to put
[18075.73s -> 18086.32s]  the VR headset on next time. I have a blast. Shito is not dead. He's just sleeping for a
[18086.32s -> 18096.29s]  long time. He'll be back. He's just in a closet somewhere, hanging out. He likes to be
[18096.29s -> 18103.12s]  in there. He likes to be in like a shoebox. He has a little bed in his shoebox and he likes
[18103.12s -> 18117.73s]  to be in there. Thank you, TimmyTim10 for the $1.00. You're my comedy humor joke idol.
[18118.29s -> 18122.05s]  Not just because you're funny, but because you're so genuine. If a scandal comes out and you
[18122.05s -> 18127.89s]  kick the homeless person once, I'll be crushed. Fuck you, Jeremy. Why did you do that?
[18127.89s -> 18143.33s]  Why the fuck did you do that? I didn't do that. Well, thank you for the $1.00,
[18143.89s -> 18152.32s]  but I did not do the thing I'm being accused of. There you go. That's kind of fucked up. It is
[18152.32s -> 18168.96s]  bad. It's really fucked up, actually. Good thing I didn't do it, but thank you. Hey, Zalaski.
[18168.96s -> 18184.15s]  Thanks for the $2.55. And we get the inevitable. Turma is bald. Actually bald image. Thank you
[18184.15s -> 18199.78s]  for the $2.55. Hey, FutureGamer. Thanks for the $1.00. Not mine, they say. Oh, that's the,
[18199.78s -> 18206.18s]  yeah, we saw that one already in the man cover. Manhole, whatever the hell it is. Hey, Convo
[18206.18s -> 18210.95s]  Breaker. Thanks for the $2.50. Hey, Jerma. Love you in a platonic way. Nothing creepy.
[18211.59s -> 18218.16s]  I hope. Well, I hope so, too. I hope. Anyways, you didn't tweet out the stream today,
[18218.16s -> 18221.76s]  and I missed most of it because of that. Yeah, I don't know what the hell that was about.
[18222.32s -> 18237.57s]  I tried to tweet twice, and it just wouldn't go through. So I'm sorry that if you usually
[18237.57s -> 18244.80s]  go through Twitter to find out if I'm streaming, I tried twice. My Twitter account got banned for
[18244.80s -> 18248.88s]  no reason. No, it's fine. It's probably just like an internet thing. That's probably too far away
[18248.88s -> 18256.26s]  from the Wi-Fi box or something, strangely enough. I love the VR streams more than most,
[18256.26s -> 18259.54s]  and now I'm going to have to watch it later without being able to call you funny names like
[18259.54s -> 18264.56s]  GeniusBoomer and GodGamer. As much as I like having a VOD to watch while you're gone,
[18264.56s -> 18272.92s]  still makes me sad. Please keep tweeting consistently. Also, play Pyre. Yeah, I wish
[18272.92s -> 18278.87s]  there was something I could do. I tried it twice. Five minutes apart. But I really appreciate it,
[18278.87s -> 18289.76s]  Convo Breaker. I got the Discord app. Yeah, if you're in the Discord, usually there's a ping,
[18289.76s -> 18293.89s]  I think, right? When the stream goes live, usually the whole Discord gets a ping.
[18297.80s -> 18305.03s]  So Twitter's probably less reliable than that. If you want total reliability, then you could
[18305.59s -> 18310.48s]  join the Discord server and get a ping. Because Twitter's weird because Twitter can just
[18310.48s -> 18316.77s]  kind of get buried in a feed sometimes. But thank you. Snoozingcopter, thanks for the
[18316.77s -> 18320.37s]  $1. So this is the last time I can give you 100 bits without my message not being read, huh?
[18321.09s -> 18326.10s]  In honor, can we watch this video? Imagine someone walking in a field of flowers,
[18326.10s -> 18331.65s]  falling off a tiny slope, and then keeps walking. Let's see.
[18343.88s -> 18357.86s]  Is this the right video? What did you just link me? Oh, this is when the kid falls off
[18357.94s -> 18369.43s]  and rolls down the hill. That's the wrong video. Why is this one playing?
[18392.47s -> 18401.11s]  There's the greatest voice crack in history. So we're supposed to imagine
[18401.67s -> 18405.35s]  someone walking in a field of flowers and falling off a tiny slope and then they just
[18405.35s -> 18414.50s]  keep walking. All right, now I get it. That's funny. Thank you, though, Snoozingcopter.
[18416.08s -> 18424.72s]  And yes, as of this stream, 250 is now the minimum. I put it in, I changed some of the
[18424.72s -> 18429.04s]  information down in the info. So if anyone scrolls down, new viewers will be able to see it.
[18430.08s -> 18437.36s]  As of today, 250 is the minimum. As of today, to be read. You can still give 10
[18437.36s -> 18443.43s]  cents or 20 or 25 cents if you want. That's fine. Don't worry about, you know, oh wait,
[18443.43s -> 18449.78s]  hold on, I can't even give bits if it's less than 250. No, that's still available.
[18449.78s -> 18463.64s]  Just to be read at the end is 250. End of a bit era. Greedy streamer. Greed. No, if you've
[18463.64s -> 18470.64s]  been here, you know, I've talked about it a lot over the last month or two. First, we raised
[18470.64s -> 18481.09s]  it to one. Let me put up like a shield here. In my defense, I don't want it to get to
[18481.09s -> 18488.48s]  a position where I don't read anything you say under $5 to $10, you know what I mean?
[18488.48s -> 18495.78s]  No, I know you're joking, but there are probably people that are probably actually annoyed by this.
[18495.78s -> 18503.99s]  But there are, you know, I don't do TTS. A ton of streamers that have similar view counts
[18503.99s -> 18517.67s]  have like $3.50, $5 TTS that just pops up. I'm not ever going to do that. I'm not going
[18517.67s -> 18522.23s]  to ever put it behind like 10 bucks at the end of a stream, but this is, I do things
[18522.23s -> 18529.30s]  sort of differently. We hang out at the end. We're just memeing. No, I know. I know,
[18529.30s -> 18533.91s]  trust me, I know like 98% of everybody. We've talked about it plenty of times,
[18534.47s -> 18542.53s]  but if anyone is upset by this, which I'm sure there are, it's not, no, I just want to just
[18542.53s -> 18549.32s]  give me more money. Please, I'll take some more money, please. That's not the intention.
[18549.32s -> 18558.58s]  It's just to keep it efficient. That's all there is to it. Post stream hangout is always
[18558.58s -> 18564.60s]  fun, and I want to keep it like that because I never want to get to a point where I'm
[18564.60s -> 18568.28s]  sitting here going, oh, let me look at the time. What time is it? Oh, it's been a while,
[18568.28s -> 18574.23s]  like three hours in the stream end. I want to keep, I still want to give attention
[18574.23s -> 18577.99s]  to like every comment, every message that comes through. I don't just want to blow
[18577.99s -> 18588.10s]  through them. I hope you understand, but it sounds like most of you do,
[18588.82s -> 18598.76s]  and we're almost done with the bits here. Got a few more. Where are we? Hey, Marsh
[18598.76s -> 18607.75s]  Mila, thanks for the two bucks. You should play VR Minecraft. Does it exist? But no,
[18607.75s -> 18620.48s]  that's just regular Minecraft, but no, that wouldn't change very much. VR Minecraft,
[18622.61s -> 18629.41s]  it's really good unironically, really. That's, maybe, but that's really somewhere in the
[18629.41s -> 18636.29s]  bottom of the list. That's like the macaroni and cheese. You get all the macaroni and cheese
[18636.29s -> 18639.41s]  out of the pot, and then you're just scraping the bottom of the pan and getting all the
[18639.41s -> 18651.11s]  sticked on gross macaroni. I mean, I'm still going to eat it, but it's down there. Hey,
[18651.11s -> 18655.81s]  Bingo Sunshine, thanks for five dollars, Bingo Sunshine. Jerma, why didn't you search for the
[18655.81s -> 18659.09s]  opening and ending themes from your favorite anime, Full Metal Alchemist, Brotherhood,
[18659.73s -> 18665.99s]  and Beat Saber? There's some bangers in there, and you know it. Yeah, I'll play it again. I
[18665.99s -> 18675.60s]  like it. I think it's really fun. I'm definitely going to play it again, but thank you,
[18675.60s -> 18680.93s]  Bingo Sunshine, and thank you for the suggestion. Hey, Dragon Breath, thanks for the
[18680.93s -> 18685.49s]  one dollar Dragon Breath. I made a silly video last night of you in VR. It's not long,
[18685.49s -> 18694.48s]  it doesn't deafen you at the end. Hey, well, that's good. Let's put it on here.
[18695.36s -> 18697.76s]  This is called, that's the cutest Jerma I've ever seen.
[18739.19s -> 18750.02s]  I need that link. Hold on, hold on, hold on. That's fucking ridiculous.
[18750.50s -> 18763.49s]  I've never seen it in my entire life. There you go. That was great. Thank you.
[18770.32s -> 18782.21s]  Thank you, Topac, for the one dollar. These bits, they are. Those are bits. Hey, Skull Girl,
[18782.21s -> 18786.96s]  thank you for the 250. Jerma, thanks for playing my JermaCraft map, even though you
[18786.96s -> 18796.76s]  suck at it. It was a pleasure, but I just downloaded Beat Saber yesterday, and I jumped
[18796.76s -> 18804.44s]  into hard and expert only. I think in like the four hours I've played, I'm doing alright.
[18804.44s -> 18812.40s]  Okay, I'm doing okay. I'm doing good enough to pass the exam, but no, that was hilarious.
[18812.40s -> 18823.97s]  Thank you. We also, where am I here? I got lost. Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam, for the one
[18823.97s -> 18832.40s]  dollar. Damn, the Jerma bucks inflation rate is crazy. Inflation rate? Thank you, Nate,
[18832.40s -> 18838.18s]  for the one dollar. Could you say Sega does what Nintendon't? No, but I was a Super Nintendo
[18838.18s -> 18846.40s]  fan. I thought the Super Nintendo was king during that era. You got the, I mean, forget
[18846.40s -> 18850.32s]  about blast processing from the Sega Genesis. What about the sound quality? The sound system
[18850.32s -> 18858.47s]  that was in the SNES? I mean, the Super Nintendo had really good sound and music,
[18859.11s -> 18867.81s]  but thank you. Yeah, you're a friend, Quincy. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey, Jerma,
[18867.81s -> 18871.25s]  you should check out the Waltz of the Wizard. It's a free VR game. It has a lot of things
[18871.25s -> 18880.07s]  to goof around with. I think you'd enjoy it. Waltz of the Wizard? Yeah, I'll play it.
[18880.07s -> 18885.59s]  I'll play them all. I will play them all. There was a Dinosaur Island game. It's called
[18885.59s -> 18893.28s]  like Island like 359 or something. You have to survive on an island with dinosaurs.
[18893.28s -> 18902.68s]  I want to play that. It's too many things to do, but yeah, hell yeah. And then Topac,
[18902.68s -> 18907.70s]  thanks for the 250. Tons of people say this daily, but thanks for the awesome streams.
[18907.70s -> 18912.26s]  Recently graduated and your streams helped me put me through engineering. No kidding.
[18912.26s -> 18917.62s]  Always come back to VODs or otherwise just to chill and hang out. Take care. Get better
[18917.62s -> 18923.83s]  soon. Get better soon? Are you talking about the doctor's appointment? Well, the doctor's
[18923.83s -> 18927.89s]  appointment is about like an ongoing annoying issue I've had to deal with the last like six
[18927.89s -> 18935.27s]  to eight months. Nothing major. It's just for some reason. There's like some weird stuff
[18936.26s -> 18942.04s]  that I'm trying to figure out that's not major, but it's just annoying.
[18942.04s -> 18948.15s]  And I'm going tomorrow. Let's figure it out. But yeah, thank you so much for the 250.
[18949.27s -> 18957.54s]  And I'm happy that you have fun. And that's an honor that I helped in any way
[18958.18s -> 18966.02s]  help you get through engineering. That's a smart cookie there. Thank you, Topac.
[18966.02s -> 18970.76s]  And CDT, thanks for the 250. If you're worried about losing viewership during
[18970.76s -> 18974.90s]  the after stream talk, why not just turn on FaceCam? It's all the people want.
[18974.90s -> 18980.23s]  No, I don't care about losing people during the end. It was a question of
[18981.64s -> 18987.56s]  the stream going on for, you know, five to eight hours. And then it being late,
[18987.56s -> 18990.68s]  and we're just kind of hanging out at the end. And it's like two, three, four,
[18990.76s -> 18996.42s]  five a.m. for a lot of people. It's like gets to be 11, 12, one, two a.m. for me.
[18996.42s -> 19006.60s]  It's just to streamline the process and make it more efficient. Yeah, the view count drop
[19006.60s -> 19012.52s]  at the end of the stream doesn't bother me. I mean, maybe, okay, if I like really,
[19012.52s -> 19017.36s]  really, really gave a shit about what my Twitch analytics page looks like,
[19017.36s -> 19021.76s]  then I'd be like, oh, my average viewer count, my total average,
[19022.80s -> 19036.74s]  I got to get that up. No, that doesn't bother me at all. It bothers me.
[19039.89s -> 19048.52s]  But thank you. It's clear that you care, Jeremy. You dropped Kenshi because of like five guys who
[19048.52s -> 19053.72s]  didn't like it. No, I'm going to call, I'm going to call Bologna on that one. You go watch that
[19053.72s -> 19058.76s]  Kenshi VOD. And you go from the first, the first stream to the second stream. And you
[19058.76s -> 19061.64s]  tell me how many resident sleepers, you don't, you don't know how many, how many people were
[19061.64s -> 19067.40s]  like do anything. Oh, it was like do anything else. Next, next, anything else. Five guys
[19067.40s -> 19084.63s]  at two zeros. It was more than five guys. Burgers and fries. Some people only know you as a Kenshi
[19084.63s -> 19088.95s]  streamer. Yeah. Some people came to that stream and then never came to another one again.
[19088.95s -> 19098.34s]  I'm just the Kenshi guy. It was maybe like a hundred people repeating the same thing.
[19098.34s -> 19108.37s]  Have you guys heard of this Kenshi streamer? Yeah. What's his name? J, Jerma? Jerma985.
[19110.74s -> 19121.44s]  No, I don't think I'll be going back though. But thank you to CDT. 250. Clueless sniper.
[19121.44s -> 19127.14s]  Thanks for the $1. Have you thought about playing Skyrim VR? All like the new games,
[19127.14s -> 19132.05s]  all like the games that came out and then gave themselves VR after the fact,
[19132.05s -> 19138.21s]  I'm not really interested in yet. I'd like to play the games that are VR from the ground up
[19138.85s -> 19147.38s]  that were made only to be played in VR. And then we can do like Doom in VR,
[19147.38s -> 19156.50s]  Skyrim in VR. But I'd rather do the actual VR true experiences first. I don't really have
[19156.50s -> 19162.26s]  an interest in playing Skyrim. So I don't know if putting my head inside of my character's face
[19162.26s -> 19178.05s]  is enough to make me want to play it, but probably eventually. And CDT, thanks a dollar.
[19178.05s -> 19182.28s]  Also, where is Autos Adventure 3? That's why you moved to Vegas, right?
[19185.46s -> 19188.42s]  Autos Adventure 3 is every day. We have an adventure every day.
[19192.29s -> 19201.72s]  And then Nate dropped this photo of a PlayStation Super Nintendo. Thank you for the
[19201.72s -> 19209.27s]  $1 Nate. Yeah, this is Sony and Nintendo worked together for a long time. And then
[19209.27s -> 19215.49s]  there was an issue, right? That made them split off and then Sony ended up doing their own thing.
[19222.08s -> 19231.08s]  Where is, where is, where is? There's a penis in that picture. Don't fucking tell me that.
[19232.21s -> 19240.60s]  No, there's not. Thank you for that photo. And here come the credits. Thank you to all
[19240.60s -> 19250.40s]  the new subs, but only the old ones. You'll be scrolling up here in just a moment. The
[19250.40s -> 19261.83s]  controller looks like the NES controller. Yeah, it does. You're setting sus for Wednesday. Yes,
[19261.83s -> 19270.79s]  you are. Wednesday between 3 and 4 PM Pacific. I'll see you guys again with more VR and we'll
[19270.79s -> 19274.95s]  do the same thing. Maybe we'll do another like two or three days on a row of VR.
[19275.51s -> 19280.47s]  I don't want to overdo it though. I feel like four or five VR streams in a row
[19282.02s -> 19286.34s]  might be worth taking a break. And instead of doing like three, four to five hour streams
[19286.34s -> 19291.52s]  in a row, do like, you know, something else. Cause I do have plenty of other things to do,
[19296.20s -> 19301.46s]  but we will definitely be back on Wednesday with more VR. I'm not going to be the VR
[19301.46s -> 19309.33s]  streamer. I have, yeah, I got space channel five part one. I've got sea man. We've got a
[19309.33s -> 19314.24s]  couple of dream cat. I got a ton of PlayStation two. There's like some new games that came out
[19314.24s -> 19320.92s]  as well. It might be worth playing far cry new Dawn for a stream just to fuck around
[19320.92s -> 19335.80s]  it and have some fun. Who knows? Fix the webcam setup for Wednesday for a better angle. See,
[19335.80s -> 19342.40s]  the issue with a better angle is because I tried to get it as wide as I could for the room,
[19344.32s -> 19347.76s]  I'm always going to be moving around and I can't see in real time like where I am.
[19347.76s -> 19351.68s]  So I'm always probably going to be in, cause look, sometimes I was just in the corner
[19352.32s -> 19355.52s]  just sitting there staring at the wall and I didn't even know that I was over there.
[19355.52s -> 19361.84s]  So I tried to get like as good of a wide angle of me standing. Maybe I'll try to
[19361.84s -> 19367.60s]  get a little better for next time. Maybe I'll add, maybe I'll make it bigger and try to make
[19367.60s -> 19374.71s]  it like, I don't think I can make the camera wider. Put cameras everywhere.
[19378.71s -> 19388.87s]  What was the percentage of time that I was looking at the webcam versus looking over
[19388.87s -> 19397.72s]  in a corner? Was it more than 50% of the time that I wasn't actually standing straight
[19398.28s -> 19415.64s]  at the camera? Your back was turned a lot. 80% you were off screen. You were halfway off the screen.
[19419.86s -> 19427.68s]  Well also when I go down too, you frequently ended up on the side of the room.
[19433.04s -> 19439.60s]  I spent a lot of time on the floor. Yeah, I did. Do you ever watch your own VOD to see
[19439.60s -> 19444.10s]  these things? No, I mean, not necessarily. I'll go back and just see what it looks like.
[19445.83s -> 19454.32s]  Got a tracking camera. During bartender sim you were half off the screen most of the time.
[19456.96s -> 19460.24s]  You almost hit your door at least eight times.
[19467.14s -> 19470.50s]  At one point you were right in our face and kept bumping into the mic.
[19477.76s -> 19485.14s]  Pro, hold on, I'm gonna see this. Somebody's linked a clip. Yeah, I am. Just like over in
[19485.14s -> 19495.35s]  the corner. This is so stupid. It's just like, it's just my room.
[19509.32s -> 19513.68s]  Oh, that's so funny. I wouldn't want to be in that room.
[19514.82s -> 19522.68s]  You were fucking dangerous in there. But thank you all. I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[19526.21s -> 19530.45s]  We had uh two more bits come in right at the end here. Nate for two bucks.
[19531.01s -> 19538.21s]  Nintendo betrayed Sony by going to the rival Philips. Yeah, until Philips CDI came out and it
[19538.21s -> 19543.81s]  was a it was abysmal. But thank you. Thank you Commando for the two bucks. Next time in
[19543.81s -> 19552.48s]  the laser sword game you play do uh hadway what is love please. Song suits you. We'll
[19552.48s -> 19559.75s]  get a playlist. And then topac right at the very end. One dollar. Say Bible Thump. Why Bible
[19559.75s -> 19594.18s]  Thump? Mic abuse. Hold on, I want to see this. You just don't know. You have no idea.
[19595.73s -> 19599.41s]  That could be a microphone or that could be a wall. That could be a window shade.
[19604.48s -> 19607.20s]  All right, I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Have a great rest of your night.
[19607.92s -> 19632.44s]  Take care guys. See you very soon.
