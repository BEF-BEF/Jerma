[11.18s -> 13.18s]  Perfect timing. I just oh, I didn't have any music playing
[14.02s -> 16.02s]  perfect timing
[16.10s -> 39.98s]  F 099 cool. Oh, all right. How do I do it? Just queue up?
[46.41s -> 59.51s]  Your ranking is visible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so I've never played f0. This is actually really fun
[59.63s -> 65.78s]  I'm really into this. So there's some basics before your first f0.99 race with players from around the world
[66.14s -> 76.88s]  Okay, steer boost accelerate and then sliding just focus on steering
[77.40s -> 87.19s]  That's how you get health probably. Oh
[95.46s -> 104.03s]  Should I be drifting or something?
[115.07s -> 122.84s]  Okay, boost there's a while accelerating keep in mind boost drains your power run out of power
[122.84s -> 136.00s]  You'll be in danger of crashing out. Oh, I see. It's like an indicator up there
[136.94s -> 148.08s]  But don't use it again
[148.08s -> 165.04s]  Colliding with barriers and opponents drains power, but you can recharge power in the pit area. Avoid people
[165.52s -> 170.62s]  Whoa
[170.78s -> 181.10s]  Okay, well that was that wasn't good, okay slide to avoid players
[185.56s -> 187.16s]  It's a strafe
[187.16s -> 204.98s]  Super sparks drop by gold bumpers and from collisions between machines to fill your super meter
[205.38s -> 210.96s]  Okay, press a when your super meter is charged to fly on the skyway
[211.52s -> 216.27s]  Okay, so I need super I need a super boost. Ah
[230.18s -> 232.86s]  That's cool. You essentially get your own track
[233.58s -> 250.27s]  You fall off of it. No, but you do that with a hundred people. Let's go. You're ready
[251.29s -> 253.17s]  25 pilot race
[253.17s -> 265.92s]  Okay, let's do it. You got some practice to do. It was my machine. Oh
[266.84s -> 268.84s]  I want durability
[268.88s -> 270.52s]  wild goose
[270.52s -> 286.04s]  I'm doing wild goose. Okay. So are these real players of these bots?
[286.36s -> 305.28s]  So what you're saying is I should absolutely come in first place, but go accelerate to avoid slipping around
[305.28s -> 309.06s]  I was gonna ask that spin attack
[311.42s -> 347.89s]  That's cool. Let's do it. Now. I get it. They don't have coins. Wow
[348.69s -> 369.49s]  How come they're not golden? Oh, the strafe is actually good to use on turns. Sometimes
[370.01s -> 404.32s]  Just killed that person. My whole face is itchy, but I can't do anything about it. Okay. No, I
[405.32s -> 406.60s]  Tried
[406.60s -> 407.80s]  I'm okay
[407.80s -> 439.50s]  Cool jump. Okay, so I did it slow down in the pit. I could have slowed down
[439.50s -> 441.82s]  I just figured I want to keep up pace. I
[442.50s -> 449.62s]  Did it now it's time for the real players
[452.88s -> 456.40s]  50 pilot race not quite
[456.92s -> 466.20s]  Task failed successfully. We're good
[466.80s -> 481.63s]  What is a grip the road with a fast one back speed for 62 for 78?
[482.31s -> 491.92s]  big blue
[491.92s -> 504.40s]  Different track I think starting now. You'll have to finish within the safe rank of each lap to continue
[504.40s -> 511.40s]  Oh, that's I like that. This is cool. I get it now. Okay, try to finish in the top 35
[511.92s -> 528.64s]  Do it. Let's really screw this person's day up
[529.16s -> 570.60s]  Not bad. Hmm. Is there a break or is it just gas get out of the way?
[570.60s -> 573.42s]  Oh my goodness get out of the way. You're just ruining everything
[574.02s -> 579.28s]  Get this shit out of the way
[579.28s -> 586.40s]  Okay, you have to be in 40th place. I'm in first place. I'm good
[586.96s -> 606.12s]  So this is a way to mess with the person in first place. I get it start passing people. I think very soon here
[607.26s -> 623.46s]  There you are. I don't even need the boost just drive
[640.03s -> 649.45s]  Okay, so you can die I was not aware that you could explode and be out
[649.45s -> 654.98s]  I thought it was gonna like key to me and just put me back on the track in like 15th place
[655.20s -> 690.99s]  Okay, good to know stay on the road good
[691.47s -> 699.46s]  So if I cross to the next lap, am I eliminating people that are in those bottom places?
[699.46s -> 708.24s]  Is that how that works? Because if you're real you try as hard as you can you just eliminate people. Oh, wow
[708.24s -> 709.96s]  That's crazy. Okay, cool
[709.96s -> 729.69s]  Okay, no, all right just drive I'm way ahead of everybody
[730.39s -> 758.45s]  Don't I just somebody else's blew up. I should be pretty far ahead. All right, there we go
[759.09s -> 761.33s]  People up. All right, we're good. We're good. Fine. That's fine
[761.85s -> 766.40s]  There's a lot of red. I knew you're gonna hit by that
[767.12s -> 783.02s]  That was not fair. No stop. Oh my god. What the fuck?
[784.18s -> 789.30s]  You can just get exploded
[790.38s -> 798.88s]  Okay, let's do it turn it up a little I'll turn it up. This is so fun, though
[801.69s -> 807.90s]  Is that too loud or is that good?
[808.22s -> 832.27s]  Don't even try hard. Why am I trying really hard just wait to the last lap and then boost past everybody in the last two
[832.27s -> 834.27s]  Seconds, what if I never played a racing game before?
[834.87s -> 839.02s]  Just stay within ten places
[839.56s -> 841.48s]  Top ten, you'll be fine
[841.48s -> 847.74s]  Just look they're all gonna drive into the red things always stay in 10th place
[848.38s -> 852.62s]  Collect all this bullshit
[852.62s -> 892.83s]  Good okay, but I'm 10th place hurt dude. You just gotta do a little bit of an excuse me right there
[893.47s -> 897.07s]  honey help I
[897.07s -> 898.59s]  almost have a
[898.59s -> 907.80s]  Super meter. All right. I'll win this right here
[908.24s -> 919.02s]  Watch out for the explosion stay behind let him do it. Let him hit it
[919.78s -> 935.05s]  But watch that turn how we now we punch it. Okay, I get it now. This is fun
[935.05s -> 951.10s]  I should really like this a lot. This is time for the real deal. Your last trial will be a 99 pilot race
[951.42s -> 952.70s]  final tutorial
[952.70s -> 971.43s]  Feel like I like it's a little more a little more durable. Yeah
[972.07s -> 987.31s]  It's not Mario Kart timing wait until right before the race starts
[987.99s -> 996.08s]  Okay, I'll try it. Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry. This thing just almost fell down
[996.68s -> 1001.95s]  What is this?
[1001.95s -> 1006.11s]  You'll now be racing against rival pilots of similar skill ratings
[1006.51s -> 1012.88s]  Okay, if you finish with a higher rank than your rival your skill rating will increase
[1013.60s -> 1031.56s]  Straightaway, I don't think this boost in this one
[1034.12s -> 1080.45s]  Good job. It's a rival it is these are boss. You said right still I can't let my rival beat me
[1094.46s -> 1125.76s]  She's driving like shit and I'm still not ahead of him. There we go. 10th place. That's what I want
[1126.32s -> 1150.76s]  It's place. Is that okay? Oh
[1158.16s -> 1160.12s]  Two rivals defeated
[1160.12s -> 1170.80s]  machine
[1170.80s -> 1173.64s]  You receive ticket points based on how well you do in each race
[1174.12s -> 1179.68s]  Collect enough ticket points and you can earn tickets to allow you to enter grand pre and mini pre events
[1180.16s -> 1187.76s]  Now this is the real deal. Now. You're ready to race online
[1194.20s -> 1196.84s]  You'll need three tickets to be in the grand prix
[1197.40s -> 1203.39s]  Special event pro track taking the most dip. No
[1203.95s -> 1220.79s]  All right. Let's just do it for real. This is it, right? All right, let's go
[1221.51s -> 1231.67s]  I'm gonna stay on wild goose. So what's considered a win? Is it like hearthstone battlegrounds top four top three top five top ten
[1231.67s -> 1252.76s]  What's considered a win just don't die off 80 does just survive to be honest. Oh, wow. It's that difficult. Okay
[1253.16s -> 1270.77s]  Oh shit, I'm going against the Joker. All right, I'm gonna try to get in
[1271.81s -> 1273.81s]  25th or above place
[1273.81s -> 1293.46s]  Yeah, this is a mess, but I like it just get all the coins. I'm not doing super boost till the last second
[1293.86s -> 1338.20s]  How come nobody drives on the road?
[1338.32s -> 1367.71s]  85 what place my in people have to be getting pretty low on health. How do I miss that?
[1368.23s -> 1379.38s]  Alright, somebody's exploded
[1379.38s -> 1395.91s]  Please oil slicks. Oh, I was avoiding those the whole time. I thought that was oil on the ground now
[1395.91s -> 1402.67s]  Alright, let me try that again. Now knowing that that's not what that is. I thought it was oil
[1403.27s -> 1415.40s]  Just survive. Okay, nice
[1416.72s -> 1418.72s]  Grand Prix starts in
[1418.72s -> 1428.35s]  12 minutes. I can do that. I got enough tickets, right? Oh 12 minutes. Okay. Let me practice. I've practiced
[1429.27s -> 1443.08s]  try
[1444.96s -> 1471.32s]  Each race is four or five minutes. Oh for a track big blue. Why not? These are the rivals. We're all C-
[1471.52s -> 1495.24s]  It's okay. Good luck everybody. All right, I'm just gonna drive and not even worry about anything else. I
[1495.96s -> 1503.18s]  Didn't get that. He's dead already
[1504.14s -> 1525.21s]  It's so rich when this it's ridiculous when there's this many people on here
[1540.68s -> 1598.29s]  Hey better than last time. Hey, I don't want to die big opportunity here lots of people dying right now
[1622.92s -> 1633.42s]  All right better than last time 43, I'm a C
[1634.54s -> 1635.86s]  driver
[1635.86s -> 1648.52s]  Drive time for another couple. So what's the strategy to actually get in first place?
[1648.52s -> 1651.58s]  Does it just try to get out in front is I'm gonna try that this time
[1651.92s -> 1657.16s]  I'm gonna try getting out in front really really quickly use all my boost just get to first place
[1657.56s -> 1678.20s]  Again, no one to use the highways you kill another you get a full boost
[1678.92s -> 1683.91s]  Use the skyway on tight corners
[1684.67s -> 1705.49s]  It's all about knowing when to boost it's fun regardless though, even if you're in 40th place top 50, that's the bet
[1705.49s -> 1730.83s]  I could do it again. I'm just gonna stay with the group. It's hard to stay with the group
[1735.71s -> 1766.32s]  Shit. Oh, I want that. It'll be useful if I can get it
[1767.52s -> 1801.33s]  Skip everybody. All right, get it again. I freaked out for a second, but it's fine. Oh
[1835.36s -> 1841.73s]  I forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot him. I'm dead. Oh, man. I completely didn't repay attention to the bar. I
[1847.88s -> 1852.84s]  Completely just I got into complete tunnel vision. It was like just boost to try to get up to like 30
[1852.96s -> 1855.40s]  And what I had it to
[1855.40s -> 1882.13s]  About this one. So how long do you when you boost for the final time?
[1882.29s -> 1888.94s]  Are you just susceptible to dying in one hit when you take yourself down to the to zero?
[1889.18s -> 1921.07s]  Maybe even just avoid that part. Honestly the very beginning. I
[1921.95s -> 1945.16s]  Don't overdo it
[1945.16s -> 1954.63s]  Dead already, dude. All right, so I
[1955.15s -> 1959.74s]  Got passed by everybody and I drove on the road
[1959.74s -> 1962.58s]  I drove like on the correct part of the road and they all blew by me
[1963.18s -> 1966.03s]  Okay, if you just boost over it's don't even do turns
[1966.67s -> 1971.12s]  Yeah, that's what it is. I don't even you don't drive on the real road
[1979.08s -> 2031.58s]  Yeah, I'm just gonna try to stay alive way too early. All right, I need this bad. Oh, how did it miss?
[2034.84s -> 2058.00s]  Wednesday Grand Prix two minutes. Do I have time to wait? I'm gonna wait
[2058.80s -> 2062.18s]  I'm gonna get I'm gonna destroy it on this one
[2062.84s -> 2076.31s]  Go in practice. I
[2076.31s -> 2079.49s]  Kind of want to do this though. I want to see it
[2080.41s -> 2085.90s]  Select it right now. Oh
[2086.30s -> 2094.30s]  Let's go. I'm going back to Wild Goose
[2095.00s -> 2106.95s]  It's good for me
[2107.27s -> 2110.60s]  What is port town to
[2110.64s -> 2116.16s]  Hey, I might get lucky because if these tracks are really really hard then people might just explode
[2116.16s -> 2129.05s]  All right. Here's I'm gonna just do old lady driving. I feel like it's gonna be helpful. This is not Grand Prix
[2129.57s -> 2132.94s]  This didn't set up. I just had a countdown on it. Didn't oh
[2136.76s -> 2138.96s]  I thought this is the one they leave
[2138.96s -> 2144.52s]  Oh
[2145.48s -> 2151.43s]  Well, why did this one have a countdown I can do it after
[2153.72s -> 2162.67s]  Sneak by that one
[2163.39s -> 2219.99s]  Whoa, whoa, should I touch those? Oh, they're sucking us to them. I get it. I thought I was supposed to touch those
[2224.21s -> 2233.51s]  It's getting hard now. All right, just don't die. I almost have one. Come on
[2234.23s -> 2249.09s]  Give me this. Oh now I know why this is a pro track because we still have to be on
[2249.09s -> 2257.51s]  I should have drove like an old lady. My god. I've no experience with these things. It's scary
[2258.11s -> 2290.28s]  Can they see my health? I hope not. This is a big deal if I can hit this
[2298.79s -> 2334.23s]  Great about 50. I did it. So do I get to stay in the race?
[2335.31s -> 2336.87s]  Got a lot of tickets
[2336.87s -> 2340.93s]  brand-free
[2340.93s -> 2343.38s]  night league
[2343.38s -> 2349.92s]  Test your metal in the ultimate five race series
[2350.48s -> 2352.48s]  all right, I'm gonna do this and
[2353.44s -> 2356.20s]  We are going to this be it I'm gonna call it after this
[2356.72s -> 2378.63s]  Stay on goose. The bet is for the first race. Will he reach top 50 in the next race?
[2378.63s -> 2389.00s]  That's what you're betting on. All right, let's do it. These are difficult. No, it's okay if I lose I'm sorry off 80 advance
[2389.00s -> 2394.56s]  That's all I'm I'm gonna drive like an old. I don't care about winning. I just need to get to number 79. That's it
[2394.56s -> 2402.62s]  That's all I care about watch this. What's all these watch all these weirdos watch this. They used to get all drive
[2403.06s -> 2407.10s]  How would you do that need to get to 80th place? Oh
[2420.01s -> 2422.01s]  You guys bet that's right
[2422.25s -> 2424.49s]  My bad my bad. I could I'll try I'll try
[2425.21s -> 2427.21s]  That's right. Sorry
[2460.88s -> 2492.31s]  Hey, don't be stupid I can get up to 50 in one second at the very end here. Oh, I have to get up now
[2502.60s -> 2505.32s]  Good I made it I made it I made it. I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh
[2506.00s -> 2508.00s]  My god, that was terrifying but we're good
[2508.40s -> 2535.34s]  Yeah, almost I tried I really did not bad though I
[2537.92s -> 2546.88s]  ranked up
[2546.88s -> 2550.20s]  Okay. So now there are 80
[2555.70s -> 2559.02s]  Honestly, my strategy is just to stay in the very back
[2559.70s -> 2561.70s]  Whatever the maximum number is
[2561.98s -> 2570.68s]  Try to get to this very very slowly try to get to top 20 top 40. I have nobody pay attention to me
[2583.62s -> 2585.62s]  So this is top 60 fast
[2587.86s -> 2589.86s]  I'll try to get to 50 at the very end
[2591.50s -> 2593.74s]  I'm gonna try to get as high a place as I can
[2594.06s -> 2697.79s]  Okay, now we do it now. I'm gonna hang out in this thing here good place to do it. Fuck out of my way
[2698.35s -> 2708.22s]  Come on, give me those coins
[2708.22s -> 2719.35s]  Yeah
[2719.35s -> 2726.07s]  31 I'm in the bees now
[2726.75s -> 2741.98s]  Top 50 now top 40 good race
[2742.82s -> 2751.29s]  See, this is where it gets weird because I've gotten top 50 a few times but top 40 top 20
[2751.61s -> 2759.82s]  This really might be actual grandma mode for real this time
[2760.46s -> 2775.86s]  I'm gonna try to conserve boost as much as I possibly can
[2776.38s -> 2788.91s]  Whoa, that was weird. Where are we going? Oh, we're crossing over each other
[2789.43s -> 2818.52s]  Easy hold this for now, you know
[2819.08s -> 2837.78s]  I'll stay in 10th place. I don't care. I got a kale
[2845.23s -> 2847.23s]  Grandma, you got to drive better than this
[2847.67s -> 2871.61s]  All right. Here we go
[2871.61s -> 2904.17s]  I'm not doing anything stupid. I had to use it because I want to stay up here with everybody. All right, just drive
[2904.77s -> 2911.59s]  I'm still safe. Just gotta get to top 40
[2912.11s -> 2929.10s]  Oh!
[2929.10s -> 2932.10s]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[2932.72s -> 2945.49s]  Top 30 that was my nephew you KO'd
[2946.73s -> 2956.10s]  You threw so bad. No, I got full boost just started spamming egg
[2956.62s -> 2961.28s]  30
[2961.28s -> 2980.01s]  This is okay. Cool. I'm doing all right. I got B pluses as my rivals now. This one has wind. Top 20 advance
[2991.78s -> 2994.80s]  You know what?
[2994.80s -> 3014.30s]  That's fine. I don't got to be in first place. I just have to get into 30th place. My camera's tilted
[3014.30s -> 3036.70s]  I don't like it
[3036.90s -> 3049.99s]  Stay up here. I gotta stay up in 30
[3053.31s -> 3063.48s]  Am I safe? All of you fucking clowns get out of the way
[3070.89s -> 3072.97s]  It's happening, but I hope I'm doing okay
[3073.77s -> 3086.54s]  All right, just heal heal heal. I'm fine. I'm just gonna bump the fuck out of this thing. Yes
[3096.36s -> 3098.36s]  I need coins
[3099.20s -> 3102.80s]  Dude, I need coins
[3102.80s -> 3107.16s]  Give me that coin
[3107.16s -> 3112.29s]  Fuck oh shit. Oh, I
[3119.56s -> 3137.23s]  Had it too. That was really fun. Oh fuck. Oh shit. It got bumped too many times. I would have made it too
[3140.02s -> 3141.64s]  Too bad
[3141.64s -> 3154.78s]  All right, let me do one more race one more. I don't want to watch this like fall guys
[3154.78s -> 3171.06s]  I don't want to watch the people jump on the cubes for like fucking 40 minutes. Do I have to sit here?
[3171.78s -> 3173.94s]  This is the final though. Oh, that's true
[3177.06s -> 3180.54s]  Spectate. Spectate leader. Let's see. Let's see how well you do
[3182.59s -> 3212.00s]  Seriously, what is the secret here? Show it to me. Not bad. Ah, there's a shortcut. Is that a shortcut?
[3212.00s -> 3218.20s]  I don't know. Who's number one? All right, this is
[3218.92s -> 3222.44s]  Bronze is in a first place again
[3223.12s -> 3238.04s]  Still in first place. So you take a left you gotta hit that jump
[3238.80s -> 3241.87s]  Risky, but saves a lot of time
[3246.96s -> 3248.96s]  I'm asleep behind. Yeah. All right. Ooh
[3251.64s -> 3253.24s]  Almost just hit the red
[3253.24s -> 3255.67s]  Good recovery good recovery. Oh
[3258.36s -> 3264.90s]  Still top four
[3264.90s -> 3284.74s]  Use your attack more does the attack use boost? I've been afraid to use it. It does not. Okay, just a cool-down
[3285.14s -> 3287.57s]  It's really actually awesome. Oh
[3290.33s -> 3298.01s]  And bronze pull it through not going for the risky play going for the continuous just stay in fourth place. Oh
[3300.21s -> 3312.08s]  And that's it it's a good idea stay in fourth, all right
[3312.20s -> 3333.14s]  Let me do one more because I actually really do like this. GG. Nice job. So they actually
[3333.94s -> 3336.04s]  Wow, it's only
[3336.04s -> 3337.56s]  two hours
[3337.56s -> 3346.58s]  Those are special cool special event team battle. How are your team to victory? I don't want to drag somebody down
[3347.18s -> 3356.27s]  Alright one last bet for the night
[3356.83s -> 3362.65s]  Don't really care where we go, but why not?
[3363.01s -> 3366.79s]  What is a top 50 I
[3367.27s -> 3398.00s]  Think it's doable now. Oh bronze is right in front of us. I was gonna stay right next to bronze the whole entire game
[3398.00s -> 3400.00s]  I don't even know where he is
[3400.84s -> 3450.63s]  That was pretty good. We've just freaked me out and I'm the one that hurt him
[3450.91s -> 3453.80s]  He bounced off the wall and hit me and it freaked me out
[3454.44s -> 3527.52s]  way worse
[3530.16s -> 3551.72s]  That one doesn't count I'm really I'm like exclaiming really a lot today
[3552.48s -> 3562.15s]  Feel like I'm watching a boxing match like whoa, don't dodge it. Whoa
[3564.81s -> 3587.76s]  Popcorns going everywhere. All right. This is the real last one. I was almost in the 25 to final last one
[3588.28s -> 3600.33s]  You're at three to one odds. You got to take the dark side. You got to try to make that uh, make those channel points
[3603.51s -> 3608.12s]  That's funny. I like that
[3608.16s -> 3611.84s]  Yeah, let's check this out
[3611.84s -> 3615.24s]  I've been I've been just
[3615.64s -> 3625.29s]  Been faking it the whole time watch this. I'm gonna get top 20. I'm gonna be a nail-biter. I
[3625.89s -> 3651.36s]  Just grabbed the wall and ran my head into it over and over again
[3651.96s -> 3679.12s]  Wait a shit
[3679.12s -> 3680.72s]  Give me a minute
[3680.72s -> 3710.67s]  Sir, I'm in a good position right now. I actually am that's how we that's called
[3711.35s -> 3712.59s]  Good
[3712.59s -> 3755.49s]  See you later suckers. So long suckers
[3756.17s -> 3781.86s]  I did it. I got it. All right that unlocked one more
[3783.14s -> 3785.22s]  actual final for real the last one
[3786.18s -> 3788.92s]  I'm just happy
[3788.92s -> 3791.87s]  Tried to be the team one
[3791.95s -> 3794.55s]  All right, we'll do team battle and that'll be the last one
[3795.07s -> 3800.24s]  Race aggressively with your team and fight for victory highest team score wins
[3800.84s -> 3802.91s]  any ko's
[3802.91s -> 3826.56s]  Go fast. I don't know which one I prefer probably this one
[3826.60s -> 3843.16s]  Okay, pink team versus a green team earn points and lead pink to victory, okay
[3855.53s -> 3872.12s]  Pink team takes the lead. It's a good amount of points so far
[3872.84s -> 3895.03s]  Losing surrounded by greens
[3895.75s -> 3914.60s]  Okay
[3914.60s -> 3932.47s]  Come on pink. All right, I'm gonna farm this
[3933.11s -> 3943.52s]  Okay, I'm not gonna touch it once this is what I meant to say. Oh
[3976.72s -> 3978.72s]  That was a good good hits good hits
[3979.00s -> 3986.91s]  we win
[3986.91s -> 3994.43s]  pink wins
[3994.43s -> 4001.99s]  Yes, we did
[4001.99s -> 4016.19s]  Surely one more. Yeah, it might as well just go out with one final one. I got it. Did I get a new thing?
[4016.79s -> 4019.45s]  Wait, how do I?
[4019.45s -> 4023.15s]  Might do that
[4023.59s -> 4031.40s]  No, that's not what I wanted. Okay. Well, um, I tried to go to workshop and it bounced around and
[4033.72s -> 4037.77s]  Let's go
[4037.77s -> 4044.00s]  Okay
[4044.00s -> 4057.41s]  Just a mini Grand Prix. We're okay. You don't have to end the stream. No, we're cool. I'm cool
[4057.77s -> 4080.52s]  I planned on stopping around like 730, but no, we're good. I'm good. Just chillin in the background right now
[4080.52s -> 4082.44s]  there's just like the
[4082.44s -> 4085.68s]  trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange
[4086.52s -> 4111.33s]  You guys are all just screaming at each other about buying and selling. I gotta get to at least top. Back in the green
[4112.01s -> 4113.81s]  full charge almost
[4113.81s -> 4116.48s]  here we
[4116.48s -> 4119.81s]  here we
[4119.81s -> 4155.00s]  here we go
[4156.00s -> 4167.77s]  Perfect actually perfect
[4169.12s -> 4171.84s]  perfect
[4171.84s -> 4190.75s]  Perfect. Okay go. I did it top 25. Nice
[4196.77s -> 4199.33s]  Now I gotta go from top 25 to top 10
[4200.13s -> 4212.90s]  these are
[4212.90s -> 4223.04s]  Just done very quickly, too. I like that a lot. So does that put me in a better place?
[4223.04s -> 4236.28s]  I imagine it probably does is this top? It's top 60. That's it. Very addictive. It is I love it though. This is great
[4236.80s -> 4287.42s]  Yeah, okay somebody's dead that always sucks I have to do it now
[4318.64s -> 4338.56s]  Final lap coming up. I just need my super boost for the final lap and I'm good. Got it some health
[4338.56s -> 4342.13s]  I have a lot of time left. Let's do it
[4342.73s -> 4405.69s]  It's
[4406.29s -> 4416.44s]  All right, this is the last one
[4416.44s -> 4434.83s]  I've never seen the end probably top 50 for the last one. Where does that put me overall?
[4437.00s -> 4439.00s]  24th overall
[4439.68s -> 4442.83s]  that accurate
[4442.83s -> 4452.22s]  This upcoming level sucks. Prepare yourself. Oh, this does look really really hard
[4452.82s -> 4463.67s]  that you tell me I have to go through a fucking queue from
[4464.31s -> 4468.80s]  Roller roller coaster tycoon that could have been a much cleaner joke
[4470.32s -> 4513.65s]  You know what I was saying, you got to go over the jumps it's really important not that not bad actually
[4514.33s -> 4533.39s]  Could have been way worse
[4533.51s -> 4542.00s]  I didn't mean to do that, but it's okay. It's a really bad place to use this but at least get across this part. Oh
[4562.78s -> 4566.68s]  Just me and you Matt
[4566.80s -> 4599.15s]  Me and Matt hanging out in the very bottom. I'm dead. This is this is ridiculously hard
[4599.67s -> 4630.35s]  That was fun. That was fun. Machines
[4631.09s -> 4635.57s]  fire stingray
[4635.65s -> 4640.96s]  decals boost
[4640.96s -> 4643.14s]  Level five. What does that do?
[4643.82s -> 4646.45s]  There's a different boost
[4646.45s -> 4658.15s]  Yeah, we have to see what it looks like
[4658.67s -> 4665.32s]  grandpa playing knockoff Mario Kart
[4665.92s -> 4691.44s]  I'm surprised how much I really like this. Where's my
[4692.04s -> 4707.07s]  That wasn't me. They're adding some more maps at the end of September just melt pac-man 99 was like this too, though
[4707.07s -> 4712.56s]  I got really really addicted to that for like a whole night a couple nights
[4713.24s -> 4716.54s]  Played it. You could did it off stream, too
[4717.10s -> 4726.79s]  That's what I did for like three days straight off screen
[4726.83s -> 4735.28s]  And I got so mad at one point that I went
[4736.32s -> 4740.80s]  Fucker and I put both my legs up and put both my heels down. I went through the ground
[4741.56s -> 4744.12s]  although at the same time I
[4764.98s -> 4766.98s]  Would use it, but I'm not going to
[4781.34s -> 4803.44s]  Perfect placement. That was pretty good
[4807.13s -> 4832.66s]  Hey
[4832.66s -> 4835.84s]  Collect these so I can do it at the very end
[4836.44s -> 4845.92s]  I'm gonna be good at this might be actually really great
[4846.56s -> 4867.36s]  Let me get top 15. Let me get top 15 right here
[4867.88s -> 4880.27s]  Yes, everybody avoid me top 15, let's go
[4881.43s -> 4906.47s]  Getting better. I'm psyching myself up big time tonight. Somebody's behind me. That's the spirit. Yeah
[4907.19s -> 4915.23s]  All right. Well, I can't go until you lose. I think that's the good philosophy here because I did I just did 22
[4915.83s -> 4917.75s]  Now I just did 13
[4917.75s -> 4925.13s]  If I go if I place under 13, then I'm gonna get out here and get there. It's dinner time
[4925.89s -> 4947.91s]  Let me take out one headphone because I'm like speech jamming myself here. There we go. Are you listening to yourself?
[4947.91s -> 4955.84s]  No, it's just sometimes when music and noises in both ears. I can't hear myself talk. Sometimes I go. Where am I?
[4956.52s -> 4997.73s]  Cannot hear anything. All right, I gotta get at least in the top 12. All right, I'm getting a little too cocky here
[4997.73s -> 5026.78s]  Oh, I didn't get the kill for that
[5033.05s -> 5035.05s]  Time to I go drive like grandma until next round
[5038.26s -> 5057.08s]  Shit. Oh
[5057.08s -> 5065.95s]  Well, this was a bad one speaking of the one to lose
[5066.87s -> 5085.38s]  Nobody touch me. Nobody touch me. Don't touch me. Nobody touch me. I finished it
[5093.30s -> 5095.30s]  All right. I'll see you guys later
[5095.86s -> 5098.17s]  Thanks for watching. Thanks for hanging out
[5098.49s -> 5099.77s]  probably
[5099.77s -> 5102.39s]  Looking at the calendar
[5103.07s -> 5108.63s]  I'm gonna be seeing some family. I will not be around. I also have some work stuff to do
[5109.15s -> 5111.15s]  So the next time you see me
[5111.43s -> 5119.50s]  Will be probably at the I want to say Tuesday of next week gonna be visiting family
[5120.22s -> 5129.45s]  And then we'll probably we'll probably end up doing a couple streams
[5130.29s -> 5132.29s]  next week
[5132.50s -> 5136.42s]  Probably Tuesday and Sunday. I want to get a couple in next week
[5137.18s -> 5144.26s]  Because there's a there's a couple things. I really want to do. I want to play armored core. I
[5144.86s -> 5147.02s]  Really want to do
[5147.02s -> 5154.34s]  Yes, it is my birthday this week as well. And hey this thing family for my birthday. So that should be that should be nice
[5154.98s -> 5160.28s]  Yeah, I'll be back on Tuesday and then we'll do armored core probably
[5163.65s -> 5165.65s]  We'll figure what we're gonna do on Sunday. Maybe browser games
[5166.25s -> 5169.57s]  Let's get back to the goofy browser games on Sunday of next week
[5170.17s -> 5179.06s]  Been a while my 38th birthday. Yes, it is
[5179.66s -> 5193.26s]  Getting there another few years another couple of years and I'm gonna be I don't know. It's gonna be weird
[5193.90s -> 5199.13s]  Two more years till the judgment day at 40
[5199.65s -> 5208.46s]  Did you queue again? No the the computer took over you
[5208.82s -> 5213.26s]  Leave the controller on the table for a few minutes of the CPU takes over kind of like left dead
[5213.38s -> 5230.45s]  I wonder how they do food mode fog
[5233.46s -> 5236.04s]  Yeah, I'll see you next week
[5236.04s -> 5253.14s]  Ending on 69 was not good enough for you
[5253.82s -> 5260.69s]  It was it was good enough, but I kind of had to do it differently
[5261.33s -> 5333.16s]  Don't booze not right now. I'm in 30th. I'm fine. Okay final lap drive good
[5333.86s -> 5337.14s]  Take it easy. I didn't get credit for that. I didn't hit shit
[5337.66s -> 5339.66s]  Oops wrong button, but I'm okay. Oh
[5341.82s -> 5347.54s]  That's bad. Oh, that's very very very bad. I got I just got destroyed
[5353.20s -> 5358.54s]  Lucky bumper, what am I doing?
[5361.64s -> 5376.58s]  I get to be I want to play one more. I
[5377.14s -> 5385.63s]  Want to play one more and I'm going to because it's my birthday
[5385.63s -> 5390.32s]  And I'm also almost 40 so I get to dictate when I stop screaming
[5390.48s -> 5393.28s]  And when I want to go to bed, and I'm not ready for bed yet. I
[5395.18s -> 5397.63s]  Want to keep playing
[5397.63s -> 5416.51s]  Understand I'm gonna go a new strategy on this one, and then this is actually the final one for real
[5416.83s -> 5426.62s]  There's no joking around right now. Actually. I'm gonna leave after this. It's a fun stream though finally be breath of the wild
[5427.86s -> 5433.10s]  Did the punch-out thing like this did goldenite gold my controls were awful
[5433.62s -> 5436.67s]  If I play that again, I definitely want to switch it up for the other ones
[5437.15s -> 5455.60s]  Still fun to do facility again though if I just hit L&R and inside of all that big group
[5455.60s -> 5457.68s]  I kind of just mess everything up don't I yeah?
[5458.36s -> 5477.91s]  I'm fine sitting right in the middle for now
[5478.55s -> 5482.43s]  But let's go ahead and use this right
[5484.67s -> 5503.66s]  Avoid all the bullshit
[5504.38s -> 5524.74s]  Okay, that's good. That's good. All right now. I just want to get leveled up
[5524.74s -> 5552.77s]  Yeah, there we go all right last lap I got a lot of boost don't waste it. Oh, I forgot that was the last lap
[5552.77s -> 5559.44s]  I got top 50 so I don't know why I was thought that was one more
[5562.23s -> 5571.42s]  Okay, all right see you later. I said it out loud. Yeah, but
[5572.42s -> 5576.90s]  It's different processing versus saying something that one didn't even count you're right
[5577.54s -> 5601.61s]  He's never gonna end I'm ending after this
[5601.85s -> 5615.50s]  But you guys put me on this game, and I can't get away from it
[5615.58s -> 5626.68s]  Did the other one still exists like the Mario one the pac-man one Tetris?
[5627.28s -> 5630.29s]  Because I could seriously play
[5630.33s -> 5633.13s]  These for an entire stream just all night
[5633.77s -> 5636.58s]  They don't exist anymore
[5643.46s -> 5658.34s]  Better start don't talk all right no talking this whole match, and I'll get the top line here. We go
[5658.86s -> 5676.70s]  Pump me out of that. Oh my god. What a disaster
[5704.67s -> 5729.33s]  Okay, here we go final lap and I have pretty much full boost probably get it again
[5729.93s -> 5759.26s]  Stop 25. We got it. Bye. Good night top 25. That's how you go out
[5760.22s -> 5763.90s]  You come in not first place not second place not third place not even 10th place
[5764.50s -> 5772.50s]  You go so far down, but they don't give medals anymore, and they haven't in a very long time
[5773.10s -> 5785.50s]  Let's go
[5785.50s -> 5803.62s]  Okay
[5803.62s -> 5810.76s]  What if I did this one of the goofy boys or something you guys would like that right
[5811.64s -> 5819.77s]  I turn it on
[5819.77s -> 5824.70s]  Hello, I go up to our sometimes. It doesn't work
[5825.86s -> 5848.92s]  You act like you're not gonna sit and play this off stream. Anyways. Do you get it?
[5848.96s -> 5851.06s]  You know exactly what's gonna happen
[5851.06s -> 5857.42s]  It's gonna happen is I'm gonna take this in the bathroom and drop the biggest dump of my entire life
[5857.42s -> 5859.90s]  Well, I beat everybody in this game
[5860.74s -> 5898.09s]  How many people in this lobby right now are sitting on the toilet? It's 99 people here. I'll be like 60 people
[5898.53s -> 5947.68s]  I gotta be aggressive. No, I care way too much about that thing. Yeah
[5948.20s -> 5956.79s]  Well, I I wanted to end it. Anyways, did I just am I safe?
[5957.43s -> 5978.90s]  That's fun. I will see you guys on Tuesday. Thanks for watching. Always Pac-man is going away in October
[5978.90s -> 5989.51s]  Oh, that's sad. Yeah. Have a good night. See you guys next week. We'll stream twice next week
[5989.51s -> 5996.34s]  I think I could get a couple in there. Maybe I'll play the Pac-man one again
[5996.34s -> 6003.10s]  I feel like I really like that check. Can I just I think I'm just gonna do that on Tuesday. That sounds fun
[6003.34s -> 6014.95s]  Maybe I'll play this again on Tuesday play Pac-man 99 on Tuesday. Maybe some armored core. Maybe some sorcery. I'll see
[6018.66s -> 6020.82s]  Yeah, Pac-man is gone on October. Yeah
[6021.34s -> 6031.66s]  Okay. Well, that was fun. Hope you had a good time everybody. We'll see you in a little bit longer
[6031.90s -> 6035.25s]  but got some birthday stuff I'm doing and
