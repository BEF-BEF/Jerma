[0.95s -> 69.05s]  Hi. Hold on, I gotta grab my... One sec. Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. Good evening.
[72.82s -> 81.48s]  We are gonna do... It is Saturday. I don't know what that means the last few weeks. That means
[82.71s -> 99.54s]  Microsoft Distributed Operating System. Microsoft Operating System. We ended last
[99.54s -> 107.32s]  night very late, so I figured I'd give myself another hour or two. Still in the window though.
[110.58s -> 123.19s]  Doink occupied the stream? Like dunk the clown? Did Cox finally fix the internet? No,
[124.23s -> 136.39s]  unfortunately not. We still have problems, but we did change over IPs and we have static IP now.
[136.39s -> 141.83s]  They know there's a problem. They know it exists, but I don't think they can fix it because
[142.87s -> 150.33s]  of a million different things. And I feel like I've been talking about this the last
[150.33s -> 154.73s]  week straight. So I'd like to not even think about the internet. You know,
[155.53s -> 162.30s]  I don't even want to think about it. Let's just pretend it's not a problem until it is one.
[162.30s -> 175.06s]  Right? Ten years. But it was actually... It was all right yesterday. Yesterday was fine.
[175.62s -> 181.80s]  And then into today. Seems like it's okay. I mean, probably gonna drop frames, but I
[181.80s -> 188.26s]  don't think it'll be a huge issue. Although I've been wrong many times before. I mean,
[188.26s -> 261.83s]  just make a tweet and I'll be right back when we get started. Alrighty. Welcome. I'm ready to
[261.83s -> 273.42s]  check out a few more of these games. Why not DOS and DOS nots? Because it's do's and do's nots.
[273.42s -> 281.06s]  No, it's do and do nots. DOS and do nots. Whatever. Title's not changed.
[288.07s -> 294.30s]  What does the title say? DOS and do nots. Yeah, like do's and do nots.
[295.54s -> 298.66s]  Some of these are great. Some of these are like I'm not even going to click them. So
[299.30s -> 317.06s]  do's and do nots? Well, then you can't have the S. DOS and do nots. Speaking of DOS
[317.86s -> 323.45s]  and not necessarily do nots. Take a look at that. So the last time we did this,
[325.11s -> 330.23s]  I will show you. We did... We changed categories. Instead of... We see here where
[330.23s -> 336.26s]  we are up here. This is where we started. I was sorting by views last time. The time
[336.82s -> 341.05s]  before that. And then the last time we did this, I just kind of picked a random page.
[342.26s -> 347.34s]  So today we're going to go back to like the popular tab and we're going to go down
[347.34s -> 351.10s]  to where we were last time. There's Super Mario's Video Game Gallery. We can tell
[351.10s -> 357.74s]  that's a good one. I already know that's a good one. So this is where we ended up
[359.22s -> 365.18s]  two... three weeks ago, right? Because I remember Dangerous Dave's Haunted Mansion
[365.82s -> 372.97s]  and then we ended up about here. Right here. Just about. So because of the way that these
[373.21s -> 377.37s]  they kind of move up and down, they're not in a straight line anymore. I would say the only
[377.37s -> 383.14s]  ones you should be clicking on are the ones that the text is visible. Right? Don't click on these
[383.14s -> 391.48s]  ones down here, right? Because I... We don't know what they are. Visible text only. And if you
[391.48s -> 397.53s]  have a moment, I would just love if you would pick the first game we're going to play
[397.53s -> 413.38s]  right now. What? Okay. You guys clicked so fast that you broke the click thing. And no,
[413.38s -> 417.46s]  porn games are not going to be played. Remember, this is DOS and DOS nots. This is
[417.46s -> 432.47s]  DOS and DOS nots. I'll change that title. That's better. What do we got? By the way,
[432.47s -> 439.96s]  the rules have changed. We're going to do three on this list. Just pick three and then we'll
[439.96s -> 449.88s]  move on. It looks like I'm going to play The Hobbit. It just... I guess it's the title
[449.88s -> 454.20s]  that everybody... Just click on that one, Jeremy, because it says Hobbit in the title.
[456.55s -> 466.31s]  Like bugs to a lamp. All right. Can you guys even see my cursor? That's odd. You should
[466.31s -> 472.33s]  be able to see my cursor. All right. Thank you. Now, I'm going to click on The Hobbit
[472.33s -> 485.59s]  and let's go. For some reason, you guys are still on the screen. Okay. This is 1993 from
[485.59s -> 494.10s]  Milbus Software. And we need to... What do we have to do? What are we changing? What?
[494.66s -> 508.01s]  Why can you guys not see this? What the fuck is going on here? Oh, right. I remember.
[508.01s -> 512.55s]  Okay. I remember. I remember because my scene is messed up. Because last time we did this,
[513.35s -> 516.47s]  I had to... Remember, I zoomed in really far because we couldn't read the text.
[517.03s -> 527.45s]  Here, I'll just do this. Fix this real quick. Yeah, I remember now. There we go. Okay. All
[527.45s -> 535.19s]  right. Here we go. Choose monitor type. This is mono or color. Mono means it's going to be
[535.19s -> 541.24s]  black and white, right? So we need to... We want to do color. Kind of wish I picked the
[541.24s -> 551.58s]  other one. The Hobbit. Press space to begin the game. Choose display with 40 or 80.
[554.74s -> 561.99s]  I mean, we have to do 80, right? Do you want... What? 8? No, no, no. I want 80.
[561.99s -> 570.36s]  I don't want 8. Do I want pictures? Oh my god. What the fuck is happening?
[570.36s -> 576.33s]  I didn't pick 8 resolution. Did I? That's not possible. It's 80. You are in a comfortable
[576.33s -> 586.07s]  tunnel-like hall with a perfectly round green door like a porthole. Ow! You are in a
[586.07s -> 591.82s]  comfortable tunnel-like hall with a perfectly round green door like a porthole. The walls
[591.82s -> 595.98s]  are paneled. The floors are tiled and carpeted, and there are a number of polished chairs
[595.98s -> 598.62s]  around the walls. To the east there's a round green door. You can see Gandalf.
[598.62s -> 603.90s]  Gandalf is carrying a curious map. Thorin, the wooden chest. Gandalf gives the curious map
[603.90s -> 607.42s]  to you. Thorin, rising to his feet, says to you, well, Mr. Baggins, it's all ready
[607.42s -> 610.22s]  for our adventure. And I must say they're looking very hopeful. Shall we be off then?
[610.22s -> 613.26s]  You wait. Time passes. Gandalf opens the round green door. You wait. Time passes.
[613.26s -> 618.04s]  Gandalf goes east. You wait. Time passes. What do I need to do? You wait. Wait. Wait.
[626.12s -> 633.88s]  I don't see the ring anywhere. Wait. What am I supposed to do? You wait. Okay. Freak me out.
[633.88s -> 644.94s]  Go east. What? You are in a gloomy empty land with dreary hills ahead, rising higher and
[644.94s -> 655.29s]  higher, dark with trees. On some of the hills are old castles that have a very evil look
[655.29s -> 662.04s]  about them. To the west there is the round green door. Visible exits are east, north,
[662.12s -> 668.54s]  and northeast. You can see nothing. Thorin enters. Thorin? Where? What do you mean Thorin
[668.54s -> 680.18s]  enters? Where is he? You attack Thorin, but the effort is wasted. His defense is too strong.
[680.18s -> 684.58s]  Thorin attacks you, but the effect is wasted. Your defense is too strong.
[686.36s -> 692.25s]  You have mastered two percent of the adventure. You are dead. What? With one well
[692.25s -> 712.38s]  placed blow, Thorin cleaves you. Cleaves your skull. You are dead. The story of Phil
[712.38s -> 722.33s]  Vovagans. The Hobbit. A wizard is never late, nor is he early. A wizard wait when he's dead.
[722.89s -> 736.52s]  Who killed him? Who killed him? Can I restart? Oh yes, of course I do. Let's try this again.
[736.52s -> 739.80s]  Gary, you're in the green door. I'm inside my hobbit place, right?
[742.73s -> 751.35s]  Gandalf is carrying a curious map. Look at the map. Look what? Map. You look at the curious map.
[751.35s -> 755.67s]  It is a map drawn on a piece of parchment of the area around the lonely mountain.
[755.67s -> 759.91s]  There seem to be some symbols on it, but you cannot read them. Gandalf opens the round
[759.91s -> 765.42s]  green door. Thorin says, well, are we going to just stand here all day? Okay,
[765.42s -> 775.78s]  Gandalf goes east. Follow Gandalf. You're in... okay, we're back here.
[775.78s -> 790.79s]  Gandalf takes the curious map. Thorin enters. Follow Gandalf. Gandalf takes... okay, talk to
[790.79s -> 803.82s]  Gandalf. You talk to Gandalf. Gandalf says, fascinating, but I wonder what I could use it for.
[804.46s -> 826.87s]  Thorin says, hurry up. What is he? What? Use map. Northeast. Go northeast. I'm not going to
[826.87s -> 831.99s]  kill Gandalf. Here we go. You are on the almost hidden path through the trees.
[835.08s -> 840.04s]  On the ground are many trolls footprints. To the north there is the heavy rock door.
[840.60s -> 852.63s]  Visible exits are south. You see nothing. Just want to make sure he's still here. Oh no,
[852.63s -> 863.86s]  Gandalf's not here anymore. Let's go north. You cannot go north. The heavy rock door,
[863.86s -> 913.08s]  south. I can't do anything. Talk to Thorin. You talk to Thorin. Where? Hi. What? I do not
[913.08s -> 923.51s]  know the word. It's. What happened to the word 20? You wait. Time passes. I don't know. What do
[923.51s -> 932.81s]  we do? What happens in the first part of the movie? What happens in The Hobbit? I try to
[932.81s -> 949.21s]  open the door. The door is locked. All right, south. You are in a small clearing, half hidden
[949.21s -> 956.47s]  amongst the trees. Yes, yes, yes. A hideous troll. Uh oh. You can go southwest, southeast,
[956.47s -> 961.11s]  or north. You can see a hideous troll. A troll is carrying the large key and a vicious
[961.11s -> 969.42s]  troll. Thorin enters. A hideous troll says blimey, look at this. Can you cook them? Yeah,
[969.42s -> 976.04s]  I could try, but they wouldn't make a bovver mouthful. Thorin remarks to you. Well, thief,
[976.60s -> 979.80s]  you don't seem to be making a very good beginning to this adventure. I hope you
[979.80s -> 985.80s]  have some idea how to get us out of this mess. You wait. Time passes. The hideous troll
[985.80s -> 995.62s]  eats you. His foul gluttony has killed a hideous troll. You are dead. I was too slow?
[995.62s -> 1013.82s]  Did I have to go faster than that? I was reading the text. I guess I had to just go
[1013.82s -> 1023.22s]  immediately. All right, one last try. Try it again. Okay, we're gonna go follow Gandalf.
[1023.22s -> 1033.30s]  What do you mean I can't follow Gandalf from here? Oh, Gandalf hasn't left.
[1037.69s -> 1041.77s]  Okay, it's map drawn. Gandalf opens the round door. We're gonna go follow,
[1041.77s -> 1059.05s]  follow Gandalf. I'm just, I'm doing my slash following. Go east. Close the door.
[1060.01s -> 1067.45s]  All right, Gandalf enters. Okay, we're east. You can go east, north, or northeast. Let's go
[1067.45s -> 1072.60s]  northeast. I gotta hurry up, though, because you don't have to look. This is the hidden path.
[1072.60s -> 1083.03s]  No, let's go back. Wait, did I go, go, go south? All right, here's the trolls. Here we go.
[1083.03s -> 1099.10s]  Here we go. Ready? Go, uh, go north. No, no, no, go south. Go, um, hide. Hide. Run. Made it.
[1099.10s -> 1110.17s]  You're on a good path at the brink of a fast flowing river. All right, here we go.
[1113.32s -> 1119.88s]  Behind a narrow bridge of stone, without a parapet, crosses the river. Ahead, you can see the last
[1119.88s -> 1125.58s]  homely house. You can go east and west. You can see Elrond. Hey, hey, Elrond. You wait time,
[1125.58s -> 1128.46s]  but Doron, with a fair way looking at us, starts muttering about gold and treasure. Elrond
[1128.46s -> 1135.21s]  gives him lunch. Eat. You eat some lunch. Doron says, hurry up. Day dawns. What? Um,
[1136.33s -> 1146.04s]  um, inquire about the ring. I don't know. Leave. Exit. Go north? Hello? Hello? You,
[1146.04s -> 1151.72s]  hello? Time passes. Doron starts singing about gold. Elrond gives some lunch to you. Eat
[1151.72s -> 1166.33s]  lunch. You eat some lunch. It was delicious. Talk to Elrond. You talk to Elrond. Doron waits.
[1173.16s -> 1183.54s]  There's nothing to eat. Okay, let's leave. Go north. You cannot go north. Hurry up. What
[1183.54s -> 1191.62s]  are we hurrying for? I can't talk to. Go west. You go west. The trolls clearing.
[1191.62s -> 1198.57s]  Visible exits are south, west, south, east, north. You can see Gandalf. Ooh, the large
[1198.57s -> 1202.01s]  key. Gandalf takes the large key. Thorin enters. You wait. Time passes. Gandalf says,
[1202.01s -> 1208.63s]  what's this? I wonder. Take key. Gandalf is carrying the key. Talk to Gandalf.
[1210.68s -> 1214.52s]  Gandalf gives the large key to you. Well, are we going to just stand here all day? All
[1214.52s -> 1223.45s]  right. Uh, go to the, what was the heavy door? South. Go south. You cannot go south. Go
[1223.45s -> 1238.78s]  north. Go northeast. Follow Gandalf. Um, leave. You leave. Time passes. Gandalf
[1238.78s -> 1245.80s]  goes southeast. Go southeast. Rivendell. Visible exits are east, west. You can see
[1245.80s -> 1251.48s]  Gandalf and Elrond. Gandalf goes east. Thorin enters. Elrond says hello. Yes,
[1251.48s -> 1256.57s]  hello. You see hello. Time passes. Elrond gives some lunch to you. I guess I'll
[1257.21s -> 1261.43s]  eat. You eat some lunch. Thorin says, well, are we going to just stand here all day? Go
[1263.61s -> 1273.99s]  east. You are on a hard, dangerous path in the Misty Mountains. The path is marked with
[1273.99s -> 1276.95s]  white stones, of which many are small and others are half covered with amazes or heather.
[1277.75s -> 1283.05s]  You can go east, northwest. You can go any direction. Where's Gandalf? Thorin sits down
[1283.05s -> 1288.57s]  and starts singing about gold. The mean goblin enters. Go Gandalf. Go Gandalf. Go north. Go
[1288.57s -> 1295.37s]  north. Go north. You are on a narrow path at the top of the valley, which opens suddenly
[1295.37s -> 1303.53s]  at your feet. You are on a narrow path at the top of the valley, which opens suddenly at your
[1303.53s -> 1307.77s]  feet. At the bottom of the valley, trees can be seen poking above the mist, and the sound
[1307.77s -> 1314.33s]  of running water can be heard. You can go east, north, south. You see dead Gandalf.
[1323.91s -> 1333.90s]  Attack. Attack. Attack goblin. Who killed Gandalf? Attack troll. The mean goblin
[1333.90s -> 1341.43s]  captures you. It is too dark to see anything. Did Gandalf fall off the mountain? Oh, this is so
[1341.43s -> 1348.95s]  stupid. Run. But you go somewhere. But in the dark, you stumble and fall heavily to the ground.
[1348.95s -> 1367.91s]  It is too dark to see anything. Hide. Um, uh, pray. Struggle. Go east. In the dark, light.
[1368.55s -> 1378.63s]  Use light. Light. You light. Time passes. Thorin appears. Thorin, to you. Thorin asks,
[1378.63s -> 1382.39s]  would it perchance be too much trouble to inquire as to your plans for getting us out of here,
[1382.39s -> 1387.19s]  or are we just going to sit around it all day in this dungeon? Time passes. You hear a noise.
[1387.83s -> 1398.26s]  You wait. Time passes. You hear a noise. It's too dark to see anything.
[1398.26s -> 1414.90s]  Listen. I don't know the word listen. Um, walk. Smell. Run. You stumble and fall heavily
[1414.90s -> 1435.80s]  to the ground. It is too dark to see. You hear a noise. You hear a noise. Again. Uh,
[1435.80s -> 1443.74s]  it's too dark to see anything. You hear a distant vroom. How long are we going to be in here for?
[1443.74s -> 1449.56s]  Just eat? Nothing to eat. How long are we going to be just sitting here for? Follow.
[1450.70s -> 1466.73s]  Follow noise. Go noise. Noise. Talk to Thorin. I see nothing here. What are you talking about?
[1466.73s -> 1480.10s]  Talk. Like it's too dark to talk. I can't, it's too dark to talk. Call out. Yell. Just keep,
[1480.10s -> 1490.25s]  I'm just going to keep running. Run. Run. I just keep falling down. Run. I'm just running
[1490.25s -> 1502.22s]  into walls back and forth. Um, use the light, but they don't know the word use. I mean light.
[1503.66s -> 1516.73s]  You light. Time passes. Run. It's too dark. But what, you light. Take the ring.
[1516.73s -> 1521.90s]  You follow no, but you can't follow the noise because it's too dark and he doesn't,
[1521.90s -> 1531.56s]  they don't know what the word noise is. Lantern. Inventory. I can't see my inventory.
[1531.56s -> 1548.92s]  How dark is it in here? Wear ring. Ring. What? Open eyes. Oh, what? I finally had,
[1548.92s -> 1553.80s]  just kept my eyes open this whole time. It would have been so much easier. Equip ring.
[1555.45s -> 1570.14s]  I don't know what that word means. Hear. Noise. What? You do know what the word
[1570.14s -> 1576.86s]  noise is. You just wrote it. You just wrote the word noise. Listen doesn't,
[1576.86s -> 1588.57s]  I just already tried that. I don't know what the word listen means. Status. Um, feel.
[1588.57s -> 1597.94s]  I don't know what that word is. Uh, light torch. You light. Time passes. You hear a noise.
[1600.73s -> 1614.87s]  Break. Climb. Close. Dig. Dig. Untie. Untie. Why don't I read how to play? Sorry,
[1614.87s -> 1625.13s]  I didn't read the game manual before we picked a random DOS game. I don't know the word pants.
[1639.48s -> 1645.74s]  What? A window should be no obstacle to a thief with friends.
[1648.26s -> 1660.70s]  Window. Look. Where's Thorin? Thorin. Stand on my shoulders. Stand.
[1662.02s -> 1668.23s]  Stand up on my shoulders. Climb. Thorin. You cannot climb into Thorin.
[1670.95s -> 1678.94s]  Look. Window. You can't climb in to Thorin. No, I don't think I would like to either, so.
[1682.79s -> 1692.49s]  Yeah, when I say talk Thorin, I can't talk to Thorin. Apparently we cannot talk.
[1695.10s -> 1722.02s]  You sleep. I think I'm just dead. I don't know how to die. Drink. Empty. Enter. Enter.
[1722.82s -> 1730.94s]  Enter window. You cannot. You cannot enter the window. Break window. It's too dark to see.
[1730.94s -> 1765.74s]  I just lit. Open window. I can't. Smash. Light. It doesn't do anything, guys.
[1766.70s -> 1773.08s]  You light. Time passes. You hear a noise. Look. It's too dark to see anything. Did you just
[1773.08s -> 1782.42s]  know? All right, it's. I'm out. I'm out. Yeah, listen to noise. I don't know what
[1782.42s -> 1808.02s]  listening is. I don't know what the word noise is. I need to light something. No. Hear sound.
[1808.82s -> 1817.85s]  No, it doesn't know anything. Light sound. All right, I'm out. I'm out. I'm stuck here forever.
[1819.59s -> 1824.55s]  I can't search because there is no. Look at. How many times do we have to do this?
[1837.19s -> 1843.88s]  I'm not going to sit there anymore. We did every single word and it didn't know half of
[1843.88s -> 1852.02s]  them. We were on that one for like 20 minutes. That's enough time. All right, we're back here.
[1852.02s -> 1865.54s]  Where? No, we're not. We should be back. Where's the hobbit? Right there. No, we were like here.
[1865.54s -> 1872.84s]  Yeah, we were. Like right here. Right there. Okay, so this is where we were.
[1875.70s -> 1880.23s]  That was fucking all over the place. It could be fun though. All right, give it a click.
[1880.23s -> 1899.54s]  Where are we going next? Light self. Why can I not see the clicks? Oh, that's why. Okay,
[1902.23s -> 1904.55s]  looks like we got a lot of people that are clicking on the
[1905.83s -> 1916.41s]  president one. I think that's going to win by what I would just determine this to be a landslide.
[1916.97s -> 1935.18s]  Here comes a politics stream. Sort of. Maybe. All right, so we're going to call it there.
[1936.14s -> 1949.40s]  We're going to president-elect. Thank you for voting. President-elect 1988 edition.
[1949.40s -> 1965.27s]  Interesting. 1988. I wonder if the sound on this one. Okay, this is the president-elect
[1965.27s -> 1973.70s]  1988 by Nelson. 2.1 copyright. IBM PC version and graphics designed by CHO. Begin new simulation.
[1975.46s -> 1985.53s]  Continue old simulation. We had $50 just came in right now. That was from Alexander Gabriel.
[1985.53s -> 1999.40s]  Thanks to the $50 and two cents. 5,000 bits. We got our first campaign donation. Oh, I gotta
[1999.40s -> 2004.94s]  turn on. Yeah, hold on. I still have the click. You can still click the click map.
[2004.94s -> 2012.23s]  There we go. But thank you so much to Alexander Gabriel. And they say here's to you,
[2012.23s -> 2017.27s]  Jerma, for being here for all through my high school experience. Just graduated on Thursday
[2017.27s -> 2022.78s]  and I'm so happy to be out of high school now. I'm going to become an electrician now,
[2022.78s -> 2027.27s]  so I can give you more money. Jerma Hart. Oh, you don't have to work to give me money.
[2027.83s -> 2036.01s]  But congratulations on the graduating high school. And hell yeah. I wish you luck. I wish
[2036.01s -> 2044.49s]  you the best in your future career. Thank you so much for the $50. Hell yeah. Cheers to that.
[2047.75s -> 2055.70s]  All right. So we're going to begin new simulation. Choose map colors. Red, green,
[2055.70s -> 2068.20s]  brown, cyan, magenta, or white. I mean red. Let's do RG. RGB. Except that's what? Press enter
[2068.20s -> 2079.34s]  to begin. 5, 1, 17. What's going on? Red, green, brown. RGB is blue. What? What am I
[2079.34s -> 2091.85s]  doing? And what's this 1, 5, and 17? Okay. Pick your year. Oh, this is what happened.
[2091.85s -> 2104.28s]  Third party. Okay. 1988. What is the last name of the Democratic candidate? Candidate not found.
[2104.28s -> 2111.98s]  Try again or rate candidate. Wait, I have to pick somebody that was actually a Democrat
[2112.62s -> 2126.06s]  in 1988? For the following series of issues in question, stats. Raise taxes to balance budget.
[2126.06s -> 2131.42s]  What is it going? Wait, hold on. For the following series of issues in question,
[2131.42s -> 2137.67s]  state the candidate's support or agreement on this scale. Oppose, disagree very strongly.
[2138.62s -> 2144.86s]  Okay. All right. Raise taxes to balance budget. What would Gandalf say? Oh, boy.
[2149.88s -> 2168.86s]  All right. I know how to do this. Ready? You guys can't even see my answers. All right.
[2168.86s -> 2175.05s]  Rate the candidate's poise. Under intense pressure. Frequently puts foot in mouth.
[2175.05s -> 2179.69s]  Sometimes slips, but not often. Extremely cool under fire. That's Gandalf. What state
[2179.69s -> 2187.96s]  is the candidate from? Middle Earth. Is there an M-E? Yep. What state is the vice president from?
[2190.78s -> 2196.22s]  Also from Middle Earth. What is the last name of the Republican candidate?
[2199.46s -> 2202.34s]  No, I can't do that because that's like, that's making it evil.
[2213.26s -> 2234.50s]  I don't know. Fucking Homer Simpson. Candidate's personal magnetism. Ease to ignore.
[2235.30s -> 2241.06s]  Average for... pretty average. Rate the candidate's poise. Yeah, sometimes you have an issue. What
[2241.06s -> 2245.22s]  state is the candidate from? What's Springfield, Ohio? No, they've never said it. They've never
[2245.22s -> 2257.02s]  said it ever in the whole entire run of the whole show. Just not Illinois. Vice president is
[2257.02s -> 2262.25s]  gonna be, I don't know, gonna be Marge? What is the last name of the third party candidate?
[2262.25s -> 2281.50s]  Oh my god. No, it's me. Let's get that candidate. How do you feel about all the...
[2286.07s -> 2291.19s]  Rate candidate's speaking ability. I mean, we're talking about like an orator for the ages.
[2293.78s -> 2298.74s]  Rate candidate's personal magnetism. A spellbinder. Absolutely irresistible.
[2298.74s -> 2303.30s]  Candidate's poise. Extremely cool under fire. Frequently puts foot in dog. What state is the
[2303.30s -> 2308.89s]  candidate from? Well, what do you like? M-A. What state is the vice president? Vice president
[2308.89s -> 2321.85s]  is gonna be... who's vice president? Otto. Okay, so he's also from M-A. Which party has
[2321.85s -> 2328.04s]  been in power for the last four years? Well, let's just go for like realism here.
[2329.00s -> 2335.40s]  Is Homer Simpson the incumbent? Yes. What has the rate of inflation been for the past year?
[2335.40s -> 2345.88s]  I don't know. Five? Six percent? Is it a percent? It's six.
[2354.44s -> 2358.76s]  That would be catastrophic. The party and office would certainly be thrown out.
[2359.48s -> 2368.09s]  Yeah, if Homer Simpson was the president, we're into something more reasonable.
[2368.09s -> 2377.38s]  All right. Something high. Like 16%. That's fucking crazy. What is the latest unemployment
[2377.38s -> 2384.82s]  figure? Well, if Homer Simpson's the president, let's say 94%. That would be catastrophic.
[2385.46s -> 2405.27s]  All right. Reasonable. I don't know. What's like... 68%. 50%. 49%. 45%. 30%. 29%. 28%.
[2406.31s -> 2412.82s]  20%. Okay, all right. So what is the current rate of GNP growth adjusted for inflation?
[2420.36s -> 2426.02s]  Is the nation at peace or at war? We're at war. On a scale of one to nine, how would you
[2426.02s -> 2441.64s]  describe the popularity of the war among the voters? I don't know. We're living in fucking hell
[2441.64s -> 2451.62s]  right now. This is actual hell. World War II? I don't know. Will Gandalf be managed by the
[2451.62s -> 2461.46s]  computer? Yes. Will Homer Simpson be managed by the computer? Yes. Will German NA-5 be managed
[2461.46s -> 2472.62s]  by the computer? No. Okay, here we go. As of the last week, national polls reported the
[2472.62s -> 2479.02s]  following average projections. Gandalf with 38% with 320 electoral votes. Homer Simpson with
[2479.02s -> 2486.86s]  30% and 81 electoral votes. And German NA-5 with 32% of the popular vote but only 13 electoral
[2486.86s -> 2491.98s]  colleges. Too close to call. There are 530 electoral votes of which 270 are needed to
[2491.98s -> 2503.59s]  win. What do you mean that's too close to call? Oh, I see. Gandalf won already. Gandalf
[2503.67s -> 2514.82s]  leaning. All right, who's leaning Gandalf? Who's leaning me? Only my home state. That's it.
[2514.82s -> 2527.78s]  Massachusetts is leaning me. Homer Simpson's got like the middle of America here. Gandalf.
[2527.78s -> 2537.54s]  Okay, Nevada is leaning Homer Simpson. All right, let's go. Ready to begin campaigning
[2537.54s -> 2541.14s]  for the week of September 1st to the 7th? Starting week one. Eight weeks to go. All
[2541.14s -> 2547.06s]  right, let's go. Economic news. Economic indicators during the last month showed a
[2547.06s -> 2552.63s]  modest weakening from the previous month. Foreign news. Slightly favorable. At this time,
[2552.63s -> 2556.55s]  all campaign staffs must decide whether or not their candidate will visit a foreign country
[2556.55s -> 2562.39s]  during the campaign. Gandalf has decided to send the vice president to a friendly country
[2562.39s -> 2568.09s]  during week four. The trip will last six days. Homer Simpson has decided not to take the trip.
[2568.09s -> 2577.96s]  To the German NA-5 staff, do you want to take the trip? He sent Frodo to Mordor. Sure,
[2577.96s -> 2584.25s]  to a friendly neutral or unfriendly country. Unfriendly. Send vice president or presidential
[2584.25s -> 2592.38s]  candidate. Send the vice president. Let's send Otto. During which week? One first week. For how
[2592.38s -> 2602.89s]  many days? Cost in PAP 500 plus 50. Uh two days. On a scale of one to 100, indicate the
[2602.89s -> 2607.13s]  quality of German NA-5's organization. The best would be 100. Anything under 75 might be
[2607.13s -> 2616.33s]  unwise. I told you I'm a B plus streamer. What's my social? What? No, no, no, no, no,
[2616.57s -> 2622.90s]  what's my social blade at right now? Somebody go check. What is my stream twitch social blade?
[2622.90s -> 2641.66s]  What is it? I think it's a B plus. There it is right there. B plus. Done. Wait, wait, wait,
[2641.66s -> 2649.00s]  wait, wait, it just skipped. What is it? Why did it skip? I think a concrete car
[2650.07s -> 2656.97s]  for the five community subs. Thank you concrete. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[2656.97s -> 2661.77s]  Five subs coming in here. Coming in hot. All right, here we go. I gotta make some
[2661.77s -> 2667.21s]  choices here. Political action points. I have 16,000 this week's overhead. All right,
[2667.45s -> 2673.61s]  political points. National campaigning covers entire nation. States with more electoral votes
[2673.61s -> 2681.03s]  will receive proportionately more coverage. How much should I spend on nation coverage?
[2687.54s -> 2693.29s]  To 2,240? So I should go all in on the first week? That's probably a bad idea.
[2693.29s -> 2703.50s]  All right, here we go. New England. Gandalf, Homer Simpson, and me. I got Massachusetts.
[2704.14s -> 2710.65s]  I'm close, pretty close to Connecticut. I'm close in Rhode Island. I'm losing in Maine.
[2710.65s -> 2717.00s]  Losing, I'm losing, I got Vermont. Homer Simpson is not in this part of the country.
[2717.00s -> 2729.26s]  Mid-Atlantic. I'm not winning in any of these. Why is Gandalf so popular?
[2731.77s -> 2741.78s]  In the South. Nobody likes me down South. Holy shit. I have no fans down South.
[2741.78s -> 2752.23s]  Everybody loves Gandalf around the whole country. 15 community subs just came in from
[2752.79s -> 2761.43s]  Ampharic. Thank you. That's a lot. Big 15 sub drop here. Thank you so much.
[2761.99s -> 2769.86s]  Congratulations to all the people that just got the subs. 15 of them just came in.
[2769.86s -> 2779.35s]  Thank you so much Ampharic. I have no fans though. Wisconsin, but Gandalf is winning
[2779.35s -> 2786.98s]  everything. How do we smear campaign Gandalf? I got it. You went into the middle of nowhere
[2786.98s -> 2792.12s]  to get a couple of hobbits to go do a fucking mission for you. You couldn't just do it
[2792.12s -> 2803.18s]  yourself. They were children by the way. Homer Simpson's got Missouri. I got Oklahoma though.
[2803.18s -> 2825.22s]  Those Oklahomans. New Mexico, close. Nevada. Great state of Nevada, close. California.
[2825.30s -> 2830.02s]  Californians love Gandalf. Not going to be able to do anything.
[2830.97s -> 2836.60s]  Gandalf refuses to debate. Homer Simpson is calling for a debate anytime, anywhere. Does
[2836.60s -> 2843.02s]  German 985 wish to debate? Yes I do. Do Homer Simpson and German 985 agree to a debate at
[2843.02s -> 2846.78s]  this time? Of course we do. The candidates have agreed that Gandalf's going to go do his own
[2846.78s -> 2852.22s]  thing. How many questions will be asked during this debate? I'll get them all. I'll knock
[2852.22s -> 2857.99s]  them all out of the park. The candidates are ready to begin. By the luck of the draw,
[2857.99s -> 2862.47s]  candidate Homer Simpson will answer first. Other candidates will then alternate on subsequent
[2862.47s -> 2869.72s]  questions. Question directed to Homer Simpson. What is your position on the current military
[2869.72s -> 2876.09s]  budget? Are there any areas you believe that need to be cut or increased? And to the percent
[2876.09s -> 2886.23s]  of time the candidate will allocate to each line of argument? What? Hold on. So he four
[2886.23s -> 2893.70s]  percent discussed irrelevant considerations, spent half the time stating his own position, spent
[2893.70s -> 2901.88s]  90% of the time contrasting position with me, killing time 12%, and then attacking opponent's
[2901.88s -> 2908.38s]  position 15%. What is your position on the current military budget? Are there any areas
[2908.38s -> 2933.32s]  you believe that need to be cut or increased? Turn to speak, Homer Simpson! 41% emphasis,
[2933.32s -> 2940.20s]  clarity on their own positions. No criticizing with, uh, witticisms. Spend a little bit of
[2940.20s -> 2947.59s]  time killing time, implying opponent is uninformed. Criticize with moral indignation,
[2947.59s -> 2968.76s]  okay? My turn. That was just a, you're wrong. How should the United States deal with illegal
[2968.76s -> 2984.68s]  immigration? How should the United States deal with, okay, kill time! Homer Simpson did the
[2984.68s -> 3002.79s]  same thing. So both candidates don't want to do that. Okay, uh, my turn. Let's clarify our
[3002.79s -> 3012.82s]  position a little bit here. Let me clarify, and then I'm gonna give 10% here, 30% here,
[3012.82s -> 3018.30s]  I'm gonna criticize with some, uh, I guess, uh, what's, was this a new question? We're gonna
[3018.30s -> 3022.22s]  imply that, not imply at all that they're uninformed, but we're gonna do some moving
[3022.22s -> 3030.73s]  around. 30, 10, 30, 30. Well, fuck, he, I got him against the ropes. Uh, Dark Soul,
[3030.73s -> 3034.97s]  thanks for the five community subs. Dark Soul 115. That's a lot of subs tonight, yeah.
[3036.34s -> 3042.49s]  So Homer is, is doing like the joke I did in the very beginning. He's fucked. He's just
[3042.49s -> 3047.21s]  killing time. His, like, eyes are darting back and forth. Um, uh, uh, don't, oh!
[3047.21s -> 3049.05s]  And then everyone laughs and he gets, like, the votes back.
[3050.74s -> 3054.18s]  Are you in support of affirmative actions and programs as a means of bringing minorities
[3054.18s -> 3059.26s]  and women into the mainstream of the American economy? Uh, okay, yeah. So,
[3059.26s -> 3068.39s]  enter the percent of time. Uh, let's discuss relevant considerations. Let's give that about,
[3068.39s -> 3073.99s]  let's give that, uh, let's give that, like, 30%. We'll go with the 25% here.
[3073.99s -> 3079.96s]  Uh, contrast position with opponents. I'm gonna give that, um, I'm gonna give that 10%. I'm
[3079.96s -> 3089.00s]  gonna go with, like, 40% here. Oh, fuck. I went over. How do I go? I don't go back. I went over.
[3093.00s -> 3096.44s]  Can I do minus five? Zero? I did 105%.
[3114.39s -> 3119.46s]  Canada tried to exceed time on that last reply and had to be cut off.
[3119.46s -> 3123.46s]  Time has been redistributed so the sum of all five lines does equal 100%.
[3124.18s -> 3132.10s]  Homer Simpson, he's not, he's just killing time. 40% emphasis on your own position.
[3133.43s -> 3142.09s]  41 kill time. I, you are fucked. Oh, and now you're just killing time. Let me give you a 20,
[3142.09s -> 3149.69s]  let me give you a 30% on my position. Here you go. 40% on criticizing you. Don't need to do
[3149.69s -> 3155.75s]  that one. And then, uh, incredibly uninformed. Let's go 30% here. Not gonna kill any time.
[3155.75s -> 3159.11s]  Right now, I'm, I got them. I'm like, I'm, I'm beating them in, in, like, in, like, this,
[3159.11s -> 3172.22s]  like, uh, Muhammad Ali did. What? German 95 has committed a gaffe. The questionnaires are
[3172.22s -> 3182.68s]  looking at each other in amazement. What was the gaffe? What did I do? Am I miked up right now?
[3182.68s -> 3188.07s]  Did they hear what I was saying? Are you in favor of tariffs of a means of protecting domestic
[3188.07s -> 3203.43s]  industries? Fucking gaffe. He gaffed. How did I gaffe? State-owned position. 10%. Contrast
[3203.43s -> 3207.96s]  position with opponents. 10%. I'm gonna, I'm gonna back off here. Let's go with, like,
[3207.96s -> 3211.88s]  8% and then, like, four. We're gonna, I'm backing off. I'm just gonna kill some time.
[3211.88s -> 3229.19s]  I'm gonna get my breath. Don't be a gaffe. All right. Are you in favor of tariffs as
[3229.19s -> 3234.71s]  a means of protecting domestic industries? Um, that's a pretty good question for Homer Simpson.
[3234.71s -> 3238.23s]  He didn't really dodge it. I did. Just, I wanted to back off a little bit. I just had a big gaffe.
[3238.87s -> 3248.02s]  I'm gonna clarify. I'm gonna go, like, 58%. No. Round numbers because I'm stupid. We're
[3248.02s -> 3253.77s]  gonna do 60% emphasis clarifying my position. I backed off a little. I don't need very much
[3253.77s -> 3258.66s]  criticisms here. I'm not gonna imply that they're uninformed. Maybe 5%. And then we'll
[3258.66s -> 3268.82s]  kill a little bit of time. We'll just kill, we'll kill a little bit. See? 50%. And now,
[3268.82s -> 3276.58s]  hold on a minute. Let me clarify. Excuse me. What measures would you take to correct the
[3276.58s -> 3286.68s]  adverse trends in our balance of trade? He had a lot of responses here. 18% discussed
[3286.68s -> 3292.55s]  relevant considerations. 39, 36. So he wants to know, he's contrasting his positions with mine.
[3293.70s -> 3300.58s]  I'm going after him here. Yeah, I'm going after him. 20%. Give you a pin. Okay. 30, 20. 20%, 20%.
[3301.46s -> 3310.50s]  40%. No, no, no, no, no. 10%. And then 50%. I'm going after him.
[3311.14s -> 3320.12s]  Derma has committed a serious gaffe. The panel is aghast. How unfortunate.
[3320.12s -> 3327.91s]  What do I keep doing? What am I doing?
[3333.03s -> 3343.14s]  62% clarifying. 22, criticize morally, kill time. What, you're not gonna make any gaffes
[3343.14s -> 3351.90s]  with like 60%? I'm clarifying everything now. Clarify. Clarify. Clarify. Clarify.
[3352.46s -> 3366.42s]  What about your policy on nuclear power? Um, I don't know. I'm not gonna, I'm not getting
[3366.42s -> 3371.35s]  into the gaffe. Discuss relevant, let's talk about the relevancy of nuclear. State your
[3371.35s -> 3375.35s]  own position on nuclear. Let's go with like, let's go with like 45%. Like,
[3375.35s -> 3379.54s]  let's state my own position. I'm gonna be clear here. Not gonna con, maybe a little bit
[3379.54s -> 3385.54s]  of contrasting. Not gonna like attack very much. Maybe like 5%. No, no, no. Like 5%. And then
[3385.54s -> 3388.74s]  we'll spend 20% just kind of moving around and doing some anecdotes. I wanna be, I need
[3388.74s -> 3395.85s]  to start clearing up my, my shit here. Yeah. See, they did the same thing. My turn. All
[3395.85s -> 3398.81s]  right. Clarify my position. Again, we're gonna go hard here. No, no, no. We're gonna
[3398.81s -> 3404.81s]  go like 45. Uh, we're gonna go like 15 with some criticisms. Another like 15. I'm gonna
[3404.81s -> 3408.81s]  criticize. I'm not gonna imply that they're uninformed and we're gonna kill a little bit
[3408.81s -> 3416.55s]  more time here. Mmm. Besides my serious gaffes, I've got them against the ropes.
[3417.70s -> 3428.18s]  In the opinion of the press, the debate went as follows. Homer Simpson, 17, 16,
[3428.18s -> 3451.02s]  German 95, 9, and 2. Nobody else. I just have Massachusetts. Nobody else likes me.
[3452.30s -> 3463.34s]  God damn it. Uh, begin campaigning. Starting week two. Questionable statements. Homer Simpson
[3463.34s -> 3470.15s]  had a questionable statement. What'd he do? German 95's running mate was abroad for two
[3470.15s -> 3476.31s]  days last week and receiving mixed reviews. Campaign officials are accepting this philosophically,
[3476.31s -> 3479.91s]  but in any event, it appears the trip will have very little impact on the campaign.
[3479.91s -> 3486.09s]  It's because Otto's a dog and he just walked around and looked cute. I'm gonna do 2000.
[3486.73s -> 3492.73s]  Save some of these points. Covers all states in a region with uh spending. All right. New
[3492.73s -> 3497.30s]  England. I'm going all in in New England because it's the only place that they like me.
[3498.18s -> 3515.53s]  Mid-Atlantic, 250. The South, 300. Industrial Midwest, 200. Mid-West, 400. West, 450.
[3516.17s -> 3529.37s]  Pacific coast. Uh, 400. Oh, this has to be 2000. I thought, no, no, no. I thought this was like
[3529.37s -> 3535.74s]  a scale of how you want. I didn't know it was like literal. So I have 62.
[3538.57s -> 3557.19s]  What the fuck? 15, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35,
[3557.19s -> 3565.45s]  and then I want. Dermot gave my phone a virus. I did not do that. You were downloading something.
[3565.45s -> 3571.80s]  You were downloading something and you got caught with a virus. I didn't do it.
[3571.80s -> 3577.00s]  Literally a worse politician than Homer Simpson. No, I'm not. I'm not a worse politician.
[3577.00s -> 3590.33s]  We're gonna do 20. I want, I want the Pacific coast is mine. I get 15. That's,
[3590.33s -> 3603.35s]  I can do 17. I feel like I want to just fail this because I don't want whatever. All
[3603.35s -> 3614.52s]  right. I went up in Massachusetts. 140. Gandalf is losing the mid-Atlantic
[3614.52s -> 3622.33s]  in favor of Homer Simpson. No, the south there, down south. They're really just,
[3622.33s -> 3628.76s]  it's too far out of reach. And I'm a fucking third party candidate. I just, by default,
[3628.76s -> 3635.30s]  get like 5% of the vote. That's what's going on here. It's going up in all these other
[3635.30s -> 3648.50s]  states. No, none of them. I'm not going to win. Ooh, wait a minute. California. Hold on.
[3648.50s -> 3654.60s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. California is huge. California is like the most important.
[3655.32s -> 3663.61s]  It's like the biggest one. Holy shit. I might win if I do this right. And I got Hawaii
[3663.61s -> 3671.13s]  and I got Oregon and I got Washington. I got the whole Pacific coast. Gandalf refuses to,
[3671.13s -> 3675.96s]  no, I'm not debating. I don't want to debate anybody. I'm not gonna have any more serious
[3675.96s -> 3687.43s]  gaffes. Gandalf. All right. I've got 13 there. All right. Anybody leaning towards my way?
[3696.82s -> 3702.89s]  Yes, let's go. Okay. The latest monthly consumer price index showed an increase of 1.7%. The
[3702.89s -> 3709.21s]  rate of inflation for the past six months is now 17.7%. Somewhat unfavorable news.
[3710.09s -> 3719.40s]  I would think so. Okay. National campaigning. Cover his entire nation. States will,
[3719.40s -> 3728.89s]  yeah, yeah, yeah. Not to spend. I want to spend it all. 1867. Go all in. Massachusetts
[3728.89s -> 3743.62s]  got it locked in except Homer Simpson. Fuck off. I got Maine. I got Jersey. I got Maryland.
[3745.34s -> 3755.82s]  I'm tied with Delaware. So how come we go to the map? Why do I only have Massachusetts?
[3755.82s -> 3762.23s]  80, Florida. No. 43, 52. No. When we get to the industrial Midwest, I lose everything.
[3762.23s -> 3770.65s]  I'm not going to get it. The Midwest is a toss up here. I got Kansas. The West.
[3771.37s -> 3784.36s]  Homer Simpson's got Nevada. Pacific Coast. I lost it again. Gandalf. I'm going to go to,
[3784.36s -> 3793.05s]  no, no, no. I have to debate. I get to debate next week. God damn it. How do I get another
[3793.05s -> 3804.97s]  state? Third party is hard mode. Yeah. Why did I do third party? Unemployment was 20%.
[3808.52s -> 3814.98s]  All right. Let's debate. I'm going for it. 1661. I'm spending all my money, but
[3814.98s -> 3828.22s]  I got to get a debate in here. I have to win some points. My only hope is California Hail Mary.
[3831.24s -> 3840.82s]  No. Gandalf is locking it in. Let's go. Debate. Let's go. How many questions
[3840.82s -> 3848.50s]  would there be? Let's do three questions. Homer Simpson will answer first. Do you
[3848.50s -> 3852.34s]  intend to follow an environmental policy that will be more or less restrictive on business?
[3854.42s -> 3859.78s]  Homer Simpson says he's going to state his side and he's going to contrast it with mine.
[3859.78s -> 3867.43s]  So we have a very different opinion, apparently. We're going to go 20%. I'm going to state 30% my
[3867.43s -> 3873.03s]  opinions, contrast it about 25%. I'm going to say your policies are a little, a little weird.
[3873.03s -> 3875.43s]  I don't know. I don't like your policies. I'm going to go just kill time.
[3876.23s -> 3881.58s]  That's pretty balanced. Now he's clarifying his position and he's killing time.
[3882.14s -> 3888.36s]  He's not criticizing me, which means he knows he's wrong. Okay. So I'm going to,
[3888.36s -> 3891.16s]  I'm going to clarify mine again and then we're going to criticize.
[3891.88s -> 3903.05s]  So let's, let's get a real good, like 35% clarification. 10% here, 25% here.
[3903.05s -> 3906.97s]  Let's, you're a little bit uninformed on this 15% here and then we'll do a little bit of time
[3906.97s -> 3927.64s]  killing. I think that's pretty good. What did I do? What, how is this a gaffe? What did I
[3927.64s -> 3942.12s]  gaffe? You, you kept Clara, I didn't wear pants to the debate. Yeah, I'm at the podium
[3942.20s -> 3946.44s]  and that's why I think our environment is incredibly important to protect. Like cheering,
[3946.44s -> 3951.08s]  cheering. Yeah. I think that we need to be very, very careful with how we do and deal
[3951.08s -> 3955.50s]  with new industries. And I take a little step to the side, right of the podium.
[3955.50s -> 3960.38s]  And I also believe I don't have any pants on. Oh, what the, I think that we need to be
[3960.38s -> 3968.62s]  on point here with every part of our environmental lifestyles. And I looked down
[3968.62s -> 3971.98s]  and I'm like, what the, and I like put both hands down like that's going to help
[3971.98s -> 3974.70s]  like covering me. Oh, I'm like covering, even though that doesn't do anything.
[3975.34s -> 3980.30s]  And like I tilt my knees in, then I go back like right, left, left, left, left, left, left,
[3980.30s -> 3998.70s]  over to the podium. All right. Am I in favor of changes? Discuss relevant considerations.
[4000.92s -> 4014.58s]  And now let's, let's go contrast and then attack and then we'll kill some time.
[4014.58s -> 4021.45s]  I'm contrasting, I'm attacking. This is a gaffe. Okay. So now he has to stay
[4021.53s -> 4033.96s]  at his own positions and he's killing time. So I should now, I should now criticize,
[4033.96s -> 4040.07s]  or I should imply that they're uninformed because like, oh yeah, you're just wrong.
[4040.07s -> 4042.47s]  Everything you just said was wrong. And I've already clarified mine and you,
[4042.47s -> 4049.05s]  you just spent that time clarified. So you're wrong. Let's go with,
[4049.05s -> 4058.76s]  I already did this like 15% emphasis. I wouldn't, I'm not going to criticize.
[4060.54s -> 4075.42s]  Let's go with like 5%, 5%. Implied that they're uninformed. 50%. Like, no, that's,
[4075.42s -> 4083.10s]  is that going to be a gaffe? 40% and then we'll just kill around. That's a lot of time killing
[4083.10s -> 4099.10s]  though. That's too much time killing. No, it wasn't. Okay. Clarifying. He's saying that
[4099.10s -> 4104.54s]  I'm uninformed and he's killing time. All right. Well, I think I've won that one.
[4105.46s -> 4108.34s]  No gaffe. And I look at, look at how fucked up he is right here.
[4109.35s -> 4113.35s]  What thoughts do you have on the situation in South Africa and to what degree should
[4113.35s -> 4121.16s]  we press our objections? He's like, I don't know. I don't know. I should just run over
[4121.16s -> 4124.04s]  there and just shove him because he didn't take a step to his left. He's got, he's
[4124.04s -> 4129.37s]  naked too. I'm the only one that can see that. So I'm, you know, I should do it.
[4132.36s -> 4137.69s]  All right. So now I'm going to say, discuss relevant considerations, state my positions,
[4138.33s -> 4148.52s]  bang, contrast positions with opponents and attack. Watch this one. Ready? 25%.
[4150.52s -> 4155.88s]  Contrast. We're going to go to, let's see, 25% state my opinions. I want these to,
[4155.88s -> 4159.32s]  at least one of these has to be big. Attack opponent's position probably has to be,
[4160.04s -> 4177.13s]  I'm trying to think of like points wise, probably 30, 30, 30, 10 or 30, 40, 0. Oh,
[4177.13s -> 4189.99s]  no. God damn it. I forgot I did 20 on the one, the first one, the one before. God damn it.
[4189.99s -> 4200.71s]  Whatever. I got my point across. See, he's fucked up anyways. Now he's going to clarify
[4200.71s -> 4204.54s]  and he's implying that I'm informed and you kill in time. Okay. Well,
[4206.66s -> 4215.64s]  now we don't have a shirt on. Clarify own positions. That was an actual gaffe.
[4216.78s -> 4228.86s]  I thought I did like 10 for some reason. I was just going too fast. Strip debating.
[4238.50s -> 4245.67s]  All right. I'm going to, I'm not going to criticize. I'm going to maybe morals. We'll do 10,
[4247.69s -> 4255.37s]  10 and then we'll do like 60 or 50 and then 20 or 40. Yeah. Well, no, no, no, 40 and 30.
[4256.17s -> 4262.04s]  This is not going to be a gaffe. I came fucking close to on the points. God damn it.
[4262.68s -> 4283.11s]  What's this intangibles bullshit? How a 20 to six fucking playing on third party mode.
[4283.11s -> 4287.53s]  I should have just picked like the Democrat. I would have gotten free points. I should have
[4287.53s -> 4292.94s]  picked Republican. I would have got like free points already. I'm starting with my ass against
[4292.94s -> 4305.08s]  the wall. Gandalf's running mate was abroad for six days last week and received good press.
[4305.72s -> 4322.28s]  They're very pleased. I'm almost out of money too. I have to go. I mean, I'm not going to
[4322.28s -> 4336.23s]  win. It's not possible. I'm not going to win. There's no way I can win. Why are these all
[4336.23s -> 4347.29s]  so close? I got to release a catchy tune. Gandalf always refuses to debate. I seriously
[4347.29s -> 4361.61s]  should have listened. Oh, I dropped. I have, oh no, my own state left me. They went to Gandalf.
[4362.50s -> 4377.06s]  I was naked too many times on stage at this point. You drop out, you know, it's like,
[4377.06s -> 4385.54s]  I concede to my fellow candidates that I wasn't up to the task of running our nation.
[4385.54s -> 4399.94s]  Or apparently I got to get one state. Oh, Gandalf says a debate may be possible this week
[4399.94s -> 4407.10s]  if the staff can agree on a time. Let's all three of us. Do all three candidates agree to
[4407.10s -> 4412.47s]  debate each other simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. Here comes the big debate. I'm supposed to be
[4412.47s -> 4419.45s]  dropped out. Only two questions. Homer Simpson always gets to go first by luck of the drop
[4419.45s -> 4432.90s]  bullshit. He's like stuffing the ballot box. He's, he's stuffing the ballot box. I spoke
[4432.90s -> 4436.26s]  to Homer Simpson. Do you believe, I think I'm, you know what, because I've already lost,
[4437.06s -> 4441.88s]  I'm just going to act like a fucking idiot. I'm going to attack everybody and kill time,
[4441.88s -> 4450.68s]  every question. I've already lost. I'm just up there because I'm rich and I can keep blowing
[4450.68s -> 4457.72s]  money. I could keep burning money. I have no states. I have no votes. I'm just the other
[4457.72s -> 4462.12s]  guy that's there being annoying at this point. And I'm, and I'm going to go fully nude.
[4462.12s -> 4467.69s]  I'm not going to be embarrassed this time. I'm going to own it. I'm going for it. Here we go.
[4469.59s -> 4473.11s]  Do you believe our foreign and domestic competitiveness has been hurt by recent
[4473.11s -> 4477.99s]  merger and acquisition activity in the private sector? Oh yeah. How about this one? Yeah.
[4477.99s -> 4485.96s]  Fucking who gives a shit. State opposition. I'm smoking a cigarette on stage now. Yeah. Who
[4485.96s -> 4495.18s]  gives a fuck? By the way, he sucks. He's dumb. His TV show went on for way too many seasons
[4495.18s -> 4502.52s]  to a point where it's just sad now. Gandalf, do you believe our foreign and domestic
[4502.52s -> 4504.92s]  competitiveness has been, you know, like the same question to you?
[4505.56s -> 4510.28s]  Well, I think that yes, I'll at least state my position on those. Great.
[4511.08s -> 4517.69s]  Homer Simpson's killing time. No, that's fine. Hey, hey, Gandalf. Hey, Gandalf.
[4523.58s -> 4530.52s]  Really made that big blunder sending everybody into the, uh, the goblin town,
[4530.52s -> 4544.97s]  didn't you? That was a real stupid idea. Whoa. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Say it. Say it.
[4544.97s -> 4554.23s]  Everyone's booing me. Look at this. Look at me. And like they have to fucking sit me down.
[4555.03s -> 4567.88s]  I'll sit down. And I'm like kind of freaking everybody up. 16% emphasis.
[4569.32s -> 4576.12s]  Well, my opponent is really just, I kind of, these circumstances are just a little too much
[4576.12s -> 4581.08s]  for me to handle. I'm going to just say that we should be more nice to each other.
[4583.93s -> 4587.53s]  What does your stand on the death penalty? Do you feel our criminal justice system is
[4587.53s -> 4592.74s]  overly lenient? Well, I think that it's possible we could have two different debates
[4592.74s -> 4596.18s]  and figure out what this could be. And I think this, and this is exactly how I believe.
[4597.22s -> 4603.86s]  Yeah, I think that is, I don't really like this question, but so maybe if you get,
[4603.86s -> 4611.62s]  oh yeah, I maybe move on to a new question. I think we should kill them both. Both of these
[4611.62s -> 4626.95s]  clowns right now. I've sat for a position. Yeah. Yeah. We're not even real characters.
[4626.95s -> 4654.92s]  We're all fictional. I think that you are out of your mind. Legalized method. Emphasizing my
[4654.92s -> 4666.12s]  current positions. Oliver Simpson is really, really distraught over this one. My opponent
[4666.12s -> 4677.82s]  doesn't understand, but we're cartoon characters, so we can't die anyways. They used to die in Tom
[4677.82s -> 4691.78s]  and Jerry every episode. I love Tom and Jerry. It was my favorite TV show. I especially liked it
[4691.78s -> 4697.58s]  when they used to hit each other with hammers on the head. When I was a kid, I used to laugh
[4697.58s -> 4716.15s]  at it. That is 13. I'm probably going to get removed. I'm going to get removed. How did
[4716.15s -> 4729.00s]  Homer Simpson win again? Unfortunately, it has been, I still got, I got 22% of the popular vote
[4729.00s -> 4741.14s]  though. People are still voting for me. Across the country, there's a bunch of just like
[4741.62s -> 4749.19s]  sickos. Hey, let's vote. Yeah. I like what he's doing up there. I like what he talks
[4749.19s -> 4757.10s]  shit to Gandalf. I love his position on Tom and Jerry cartoons. Yeah. Fuck the other
[4757.10s -> 4769.48s]  candidates. All right. Only two weeks to go. We have to see this through. Inflation increased
[4769.48s -> 4782.65s]  by 2%. That's so bad. Gandalf had a questionable statement, probably because he was talking
[4782.65s -> 4792.94s]  about me. I don't want to be on stage with that maniac anymore. He's purely uninformed and
[4793.96s -> 4805.86s]  possibly insane. Oh boy, I dropped out big time here. I know what it's like to deal with
[4805.86s -> 4814.28s]  maniacs. Sauron, Saruman, all of them. He reminds me of them when they were younger.
[4819.64s -> 4826.28s]  He may as well change his name to Smurma because all bad guys names start with an S
[4827.40s -> 4849.62s]  and end with an O and he should be Smurron. Holy fuck, I'm losing bad. How did Homer Simpson,
[4849.62s -> 4856.66s]  this looks like this is just a fucking like you hold down tab in an online game.
[4857.46s -> 4860.98s]  Homer Simpson just doing too good to a point where like you don't want them in the server
[4860.98s -> 4867.51s]  anymore. You know what I mean? You even like hold down tab and you just like got 315 points.
[4867.51s -> 4876.89s]  Okay, I'm going somewhere else. North Dakota and South Dakota both do not like me at all.
[4885.00s -> 4893.27s]  Who knows this even bad? It's 408. What happened? Do I wish to debate?
[4895.98s -> 4907.77s]  Gandalf doesn't want to debate. I'm not debating. This is the last week. One week to go.
[4909.91s -> 4918.46s]  Unemployment was 20%. Gaffs committed Homer Simpson. They're like, I've kind of like
[4918.46s -> 4922.30s]  detonated the space here. Like I said a bunch of crazy shit and now they're like
[4923.26s -> 4926.86s]  backpedaling, stepping forward, making like gaffs and questionable statements. I'm really
[4926.86s -> 4938.06s]  like Homer committed a gaff. All right. So I got eight. Yeah, spin it all. Who cares?
[4939.72s -> 4946.68s]  I'm just doing this for fun. Massachusetts, 120 points. Yeah, I remember when I had
[4946.68s -> 4954.02s]  Massachusetts. They all thought I was awesome. And then I read in the newspaper I was naked
[4954.02s -> 4971.35s]  five times on stage. And all those other brutes didn't like it. They all said I should
[4971.35s -> 4979.70s]  put some clothes on. I said, yeah. During the interview, German 95 was also nude.
[4979.70s -> 4998.73s]  Why say I should not have to do that? It's Ed Bighead. No, no, you're talking about
[4998.73s -> 5006.55s]  the other Bighead. Bighead. That's that's Ed Bighead. Bighead's wife was what was
[5006.55s -> 5019.50s]  Bighead's wife's name? Bev. Yeah, that's Bev Bighead is unwilling to debate at this time.
[5020.94s -> 5031.11s]  I'm just going to take the loss and leave. No, I don't want to debate. I'm done. I give up.
[5032.55s -> 5043.06s]  I'm not debating anymore. I'm taking the loss. This is the final week. Good news.
[5045.24s -> 5052.25s]  The economic indicators are up. Yeah, whatever. Spend the last $6.56. Not like I care.
[5054.09s -> 5062.87s]  Yeah, apparently the people of Maine and Rhode Island also do not care because I have
[5062.87s -> 5073.11s]  almost 33% of the vote for this week, polling wise. Here's the final debate. This is the last
[5073.11s -> 5081.46s]  the presidential debate. Unwilling is why would you be unwilling to? Yeah, let's go.
[5083.00s -> 5087.00s]  Let's go. Yeah, the guy that's running everything, the guy that's winning everything.
[5088.25s -> 5094.79s]  One question, two questions, two questions. Okay, I get to answer first.
[5098.90s -> 5103.29s]  What's this? This is interesting. Everyone's kind of sitting in their seats right now
[5103.29s -> 5114.33s]  looking in sort of confusion. German985 has come on stage in a suit with styled hair and looks
[5114.33s -> 5118.25s]  like he had some work. He had like green teeth last time. Looks like he had some work done on
[5118.25s -> 5124.30s]  his teeth and he smells considerably better and people are a little concerned about this.
[5124.30s -> 5129.66s]  He's just normal. He gets the first question. He comes on stage and he's very just relaxed.
[5131.18s -> 5138.14s]  Uh, uh, we can begin the debate. Now, um, Mr. Albertson, given recent demographic trends,
[5138.78s -> 5145.34s]  what is the likelihood of your administration proposing a return to selective service system?
[5154.18s -> 5164.87s]  Well, on further positioning and moving my name around and looking at the facts,
[5167.80s -> 5172.25s]  trying to find out what is real and what isn't and all of us have different things
[5172.25s -> 5180.36s]  and different opinions that we all care about and decide that is important. And every single day
[5182.90s -> 5192.70s]  we come together as a group of not, not this person, this person, but as Americans to gaze
[5192.70s -> 5199.58s]  upon the beauty of my body. Oh, God damn it. He ripped his clothes. He fucking depated us.
[5201.58s -> 5212.97s]  God damn it. He did it again. Yeah. Get the fucking cops in here. I don't care. Hey,
[5213.53s -> 5217.29s]  uh, get off me. I don't care if I fucking lose.
[5225.82s -> 5236.23s]  Give it. Get off. I'll rip your head off. I'll kill him. Get him in the car.
[5236.63s -> 5239.98s]  I'm not, I'm not going down without a fight.
[5244.84s -> 5272.54s]  So who won? Silence. Gandalf gets the most. Okay. I was hard not to laugh at that
[5272.54s -> 5276.78s]  because it said Gandalf seems to have come out the most from this debate.
[5282.78s -> 5291.03s]  He probably was like, fuck you. No, I can't say that on TV. Project next date. Okay.
[5293.08s -> 5303.64s]  So what state is this? Ooh. Holy shit. I got 634,000 votes.
[5319.88s -> 5329.64s]  Let's just go to the final. Fuck this. Did I get any states? No, I don't think so.
[5330.36s -> 5342.76s]  Well, the results are in. Ladies and gentlemen, your newest president of the United States
[5342.76s -> 5363.83s]  of America. Please welcome to the stage Gandalf. He wins a landslide. That's so fucking
[5363.83s -> 5378.62s]  ridiculous. Chairman at five is was last seen being taken to the local penitentiary.
[5382.34s -> 5390.07s]  He said in the back of the squad car, if you let me just open the door and fall out on the
[5390.07s -> 5398.52s]  highway, pretending, and this is a direct quote, pretending that I escaped, I will deposit
[5399.24s -> 5408.63s]  a hundred grand into both of your bank accounts. He now awaits trial.
[5408.63s -> 5428.81s]  Look at this map. It's like never been a map like this. I think this has happened like twice in
[5428.81s -> 5440.74s]  history. You got a fully, a fully red, a fully red west and east coast, and the middle is blue.
[5442.81s -> 5458.17s]  That very, that doesn't ever happen. The color's a flip. No, Homer Simpson was,
[5458.17s -> 5467.18s]  was the Democrat, wasn't he? Wait, what? No, red, red was, was Homer Republican?
[5471.27s -> 5479.78s]  Wait, hold on. I get invited to the inauguration? Why would they do blue Republican and red
[5479.78s -> 5488.89s]  Democrat? That's been like that for like hundreds of years. All right, I get to go to
[5488.89s -> 5502.18s]  the inauguration. I'm in like cuffs and like an orange suit. See, president. Oh, there it is.
[5502.18s -> 5507.83s]  It's time to move on to the next one. It's been like that for millions of years.
[5509.37s -> 5526.55s]  That was president-elect 1988 edition. So where to now? Oh, this is incorrect though.
[5526.55s -> 5536.63s]  This needs to be like this. There we go. So we were down here. You've been invited to the
[5536.63s -> 5550.89s]  inauguration and with a pair of clothes. So it was down here, right here somewhere, right here.

[5562.98s -> 5572.70s]  Here we go. Remember, you have to be able to see the text. I'm not doing leisure suit,
[5572.70s -> 5595.34s]  Larry. No, no. Go again. It's not a porn game. It is the original porn game. It's the porn game
[5595.34s -> 5599.18s]  to create all porn games. It's the one that they based all the other porn games off of.
[5600.06s -> 5603.50s]  Every porn game that you've played in the last 10 years is because of the porn game that
[5603.50s -> 5624.04s]  was the leisure suit Larry porn game. Damn it. All right, you ready? Ready for this?

[5710.06s -> 5714.46s]  elements of plot which may not be suitable. They may not be appropriate for children.
[5715.72s -> 5721.72s]  No, how old are you? Oh, okay. Oh, it's not a porn game. We just have a click,
[5721.72s -> 5729.80s]  a age verification click thing. It's not a porn game though. Hey, look, I still get to click
[5729.80s -> 5739.96s]  this one. Yeah, sure you are. To verify your age, please answer the five simple questions.
[5741.11s -> 5744.71s]  Ah, who lost a daughter but gained a meathead? I don't fucking know.

[5758.98s -> 5763.83s]  Not that this like a shirt on. Which U.S. Secretary of State was born in Germany?
[5770.57s -> 5776.15s]  Who was the inventive genius behind the Apple computer? That's Steve Wozniak.
[5779.53s -> 5787.50s]  Close encounters of the third kind is about creatures from outer space. Yes.
[5789.50s -> 5796.30s]  IBM stands for itsy bitsy men. It's international business machines.
[5798.42s -> 5801.38s]  And now a question that won't tax your memory. This question refers to
[5801.38s -> 5807.16s]  your documentation that came with your copy of the game. Okay, so we can't play this one.
[5809.13s -> 5814.25s]  The gal sitting around the campfire is playing a what? This is your one chance.

[5856.50s -> 5864.04s]  I can't reset it because I have to, I'm stuck in this window. It looks like it's harmonica.
[5869.14s -> 5874.10s]  I'm clicking harmonica. You guys, this is why you can't have nice things.
[5874.74s -> 5881.46s]  It's actually B. I looked it up. Did you look it up? Was this real?
[5887.21s -> 5890.33s]  Thank you. And now slip into your leisure suit and prepare to enter the land of
[5891.05s -> 5901.42s]  lounge lizards with leisure shoot suit Larry. Okay, I got it ready. All right,
[5901.42s -> 5907.56s]  there I am. I want to exit this game just because how slow you move.

[5925.30s -> 5936.18s]  Nice tuck and roll. What? So that right click is change. Right click changes what you do.

[5952.86s -> 5962.81s]  Dan. He has nothing to say but says it continuously. You coily turn your back and
[5962.81s -> 5968.57s]  relieve yourself. You quickly feel much better. The hint of smile. What? Did I just piss on the
[5968.57s -> 5978.82s]  ground? This place has no taste. I can like taste things? To you, Lefty has no distinctive
[5978.82s -> 5996.74s]  smell or taste. You greet the bartender with a friendly hello. What'll it be? Around. Around

[6046.07s -> 6049.67s]  up this emulator? I don't think... I mean this is just like on a website. It's like a browser.
[6050.23s -> 6060.74s]  I'm not sure I can do it from here. Is it rad on the guy's head? You take pity on the poor
[6060.74s -> 6079.51s]  drunken want to help him, but his odor convinces you otherwise. Oh, fuck. There we go. Oh, Jesus.

[6094.39s -> 6151.80s]  Through the toilet. Did it crash? I crashed. I think it was like fucked up. Something happened.
[6153.14s -> 6157.46s]  I saw Leisure Suit Larry's dick and then like he started shitting. So no, we're not

[6201.22s -> 6211.03s]  Let's go down to here. Make sure we get the ones with the text only. Text only. Remember,
[6211.03s -> 6232.34s]  that's very important. And here we go. Please click what you'd like to see. Wow,
[6232.34s -> 6246.34s]  this is all over the place. This is very, very, very spread out, but there is a clear
[6246.34s -> 6266.68s]  winner. Very much so. With 35% or 37% of the vote at this point. Everyone seems to be changing
[6266.68s -> 6281.10s]  their mind. Thank you for voting. That's all we need to see. To spread out. Where in the USA

[6338.34s -> 6345.56s]  shit. That would go up your nose and kill you. You would like, you would sneeze and that antenna
[6345.56s -> 6356.50s]  would go into your nose, through your nostril, into your brain and you die. What are we doing?

[6546.92s -> 6550.44s]  The heart of New York City is connected to the mainland by a number of
[6550.44s -> 6554.28s]  bridges. Perhaps the most famous of these is the graceful arching Brooklyn Bridge,
[6554.28s -> 6560.54s]  which links Manhattan to the borough of Brooklyn. Speak to student. He cried
[6561.34s -> 6573.70s]  off for Omaha. Who did? Check campus. Item book description titled Adventures on the

[6649.70s -> 6655.38s]  love the great outdoors. For those who prefer to take their outdoor recreation sitting down,
[6659.14s -> 6663.54s]  that person died. There's a multitude of rodeos to visit. What is that supposed to be?
[6670.12s -> 6674.58s]  When I think of Nebraska, I don't think of circus performers.
[6679.10s -> 6684.58s]  Okay. So let's speak to the violinist. He said he had a capital idea to infiltrate
[6684.58s -> 6690.89s]  the capital building of the spud state. He asked me if I knew a good mambo teacher.
[6690.89s -> 6699.94s]  That would be Idaho. Check the pit. This is the dictaphone. Description heard on tape.
[6699.94s -> 6704.74s]  It all boils down to this, small fry. When searching for the spud state, look under capital
[6704.74s -> 6715.48s]  I. Dustin. All right. Idaho. Keep your eyes peeled for the criminal in the spud state.
[6716.89s -> 6734.78s]  You've got it. Boise. What the fuck is this game? It's called Freelance Palish. Open up.
[6734.78s -> 6738.62s]  Although much of Idaho's mountains terrain is not well suited for agriculture.
[6739.58s -> 6759.85s]  There's ice skating in Idaho? That was a, what's going on? Okay. Some parts of the state
[6759.85s -> 6764.41s]  can successfully support ranches and farms. Cattle ranching and dairy farming are both
[6764.41s -> 6769.29s]  important here, but Idaho's most famous product is the potato. Let's talk to the jogger.
[6771.45s -> 6776.65s]  He indicated he'd be transplanting himself to Baltimore for a caper at Johns Hopkins medical
[6776.65s -> 6782.98s]  school. Beware of anyone who challenges you to a game of go fish. It's fucking Mario. Super

[6821.74s -> 6831.51s]  no, no. Wait, wait. I didn't want to do this. Cancel. This game is nonsense. A coquette
[6831.51s -> 6841.94s]  made this game. What? What are you talking about? All right. Let's go to Maryland.
[6844.71s -> 6854.04s]  Why would you, what does that even mean? Okay. Question jogger again.
[6856.47s -> 6880.17s]  Oh, gold teeth. Is that him? That's the worst one yet. That's not how you hide to Ivan. Okay.
[6881.21s -> 6885.75s]  He was determined to lose himself in the largest state in the nation. He collected recipes from
[6885.75s -> 6896.94s]  Paris. Okay. Um, well, I know, mail, hair hobby, card games, gardening, painting, star
[6897.82s -> 6905.70s]  card games, go fish. Do we get my, we should have been doing this.
[6906.42s -> 6909.88s]  All right. Let's like enter that into evidence. Transmit that.

[6947.02s -> 6958.65s]  two people in the country that are male and like card games. Okay. This is the fair city
[6958.65s -> 6966.84s]  of Fairbanks. Our biggest state in the, what is it? Fucking Alaska, Texas. Which one is it?
[6966.84s -> 6984.38s]  California. Are we talking like volume? It's Texas. Yeah, let's go. What do you mean?
[6984.38s -> 7003.83s]  It is Alaska. I had it right. Okay. What do you mean I didn't know that?
[7004.71s -> 7014.17s]  You're dumping trash here? What are you, why are you dumping trash in Alaska? That's not even like,
[7014.17s -> 7027.67s]  hey, I'm a bad guy spying on you. We're just dumping in Alaska. What? Okay. So let's talk
[7027.67s -> 7031.19s]  to the actress. There are a lot of shady characters lurking around here. I'd be
[7031.19s -> 7036.17s]  careful if I were you. By the way, do you have a warrant? That's Carmen San Diego right
[7036.17s -> 7060.66s]  there. Arrest. How do you arrest a person? She's gone. File written in large black letters
[7060.66s -> 7080.89s]  in the front. Okay. I just let Carmen San Diego go. There they go. We're going in the Ghostbusters
[7080.89s -> 7113.67s]  car. Did we get them? Urgent report. Ray Zarumpis has just been tracked to Alaska by
[7113.67s -> 7119.16s]  Gumshoe Jerma. However, the suspect could not be held because the arresting officer
[7119.16s -> 7131.93s]  did not have a warrant. No, you're going to have to try. Okay. Are you ready for another
[7131.93s -> 7148.15s]  case? No, I don't really want to fly from city to city. That was fun. That was cute. It was fun.
[7148.15s -> 7161.35s]  It was like a game for kids. That's going to be it for that one. It was like a game. You know,
[7161.35s -> 7170.41s]  it was like a game for kids. Alright, so we got a couple more to do here. Get the list back
[7170.41s -> 7183.19s]  on. It was right here, if I'm not mistaken, right? Right here. This looks correct. Is it
[7183.19s -> 7193.66s]  correct or was it down more like right here? Yeah, it was right there. Okay. So remember
[7193.66s -> 7201.78s]  the text on the screen. Do not click ones that do not have text. Like don't click down here.
[7201.78s -> 7208.79s]  You're not going to be valid. Only places with text. Here we go. Please click on the
[7208.79s -> 7212.54s]  screen where you'd like us to go next. It's up to you, not up to me.
[7222.66s -> 7248.97s]  Interesting. Interesting selections. How many times can you click once? One click per person.
[7250.42s -> 7254.18s]  That's as many. It's not going to count if you do it again. It's only going to count the first
[7254.18s -> 7267.77s]  time. So we got 32%. We're going to burger time. Thank you for voting. We will come back here
[7267.77s -> 7273.14s]  and we will do the last one on this list. So yeah, I'm not going to click. I'm going to
[7273.14s -> 7287.54s]  actually open a new window. Burger time. This is by 1982. This is really old. I failed to
[7287.54s -> 7297.06s]  download the metadata. Oh no, why is that? Good places to be. Mattel Electronics presents
[7297.06s -> 7303.67s]  Burger Time. Type joystick or keyboard to start. I mean we have to use keyboard. Press the space
[7303.67s -> 7310.94s]  bar to start the game. Press the zero key to select options. To pause game. What were the

[7324.31s -> 7333.86s]  the chef, use the up down left right. Okay. Here we go. If you don't know how to do
[7333.86s -> 7339.27s]  burger time, burger time is you have to make a hamburger. Wait, don't you have to
[7339.27s -> 7351.30s]  knock them down? Oh no, you have to kill them by knocking them down. Now I remember. I thought
[7351.30s -> 7354.26s]  you had to make. Oh no, you do have to make a burger. No, no, I'm right. I was right. I was
[7354.26s -> 7371.94s]  right. Oh, I got it. All right. I got to get this one right. See if we can get them all.
[7374.68s -> 7404.90s]  Get it. Oh, I need a bun. Bait them over here. Down. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops.
[7404.90s -> 7417.58s]  It's okay. Let's close this one out. Bingo. Oh, I thought they were going to go hey.
[7417.58s -> 7437.77s]  They're all clumped up too. Oops. There's one burger done. I'm just going to do buns.
[7439.35s -> 7446.58s]  Fuck. I thought they're going to keep walking. What is this thing? Is it like a power up?
[7446.58s -> 7452.79s]  Got it. All right. Let's do. Let's wait. We got time. Oh, not good. Not good. Not good.
[7452.79s -> 7472.09s]  I have to bait this one. Let me get all four burgs all the way, all the way, all the way,
[7472.09s -> 7509.82s]  all the way up, all the way. Bait them all over here. Every single one. Oh, that was close.
[7509.82s -> 7522.14s]  Get them all. All four. No, I'm going to get collapsed on. Oh, no, no. Pepper, pepper,
[7522.14s -> 7529.80s]  pepper, pepper, pepper, pepper. I'm dead. Fuck. I'm so mad. Oh, my god damn. No, I got an extra life.
[7559.80s -> 7594.02s]  Shit. I try to get them. I got to go all the way up. Coffee. Oh, fuck. Right here. Right here.
[7594.02s -> 7619.18s]  Right here. Got it. I have no pepper left, do I? Uh-oh. I got to go down. Now. Fuck.
[7623.66s -> 7664.94s]  I got two more lives. I'm losing them here. Oh, I lost it. I can still do it.
[7664.94s -> 7691.67s]  Oh, no. Ah. No. Fuck. This game is so much fun. Come on. I can do it. I get to level three.
[7691.67s -> 7714.26s]  I can do it. I have two more buns. Baited. Good work. I hate it. That's it. Fuck.
[7715.30s -> 7743.80s]  I had it too. I was doing so well. Last try. Last try. This is the last one. Straight up.
[7743.80s -> 7768.71s]  No, come up here. Straight up. No unnecessary deaths here. And then smush them. Smush.
[7769.96s -> 7779.59s]  I can't believe I didn't get it. I'm fucking done. I'm exiting. I just. I got too greedy.
[7779.59s -> 7787.27s]  I really did. I didn't get that. I'm losing it. That was greedy too, but it was worth it.
[7787.99s -> 7800.55s]  Too bad I don't have anything to do anything right here, but I can get something right now.
[7800.55s -> 7826.97s]  If I get up there quick enough, I can get at least one of them. Stupid. Stupid little
[7826.97s -> 7846.28s]  lettuces. Whatever you are. Give me points. All right. Last one. And then I'm going to go
[7846.28s -> 7862.52s]  for the clothes here. Oh, fuck. I got to go up. Oh, no. Pepper. It's close. They're
[7862.52s -> 7883.43s]  pickles. You dill. What are the other things? Onions? Ah, too greedy. Don't do it. I got
[7883.43s -> 7904.30s]  so greedy. I'm you. I'm doing too much pepper. I need this pepper. I'm going too fast. Oh,
[7904.30s -> 7909.02s]  dude. I'm going to, you know, I'm going to watch somebody do like a full speed run
[7909.02s -> 7918.60s]  of this game tomorrow. Why tomorrow? I don't know. All right. I'm going to do this one.
[7918.60s -> 7923.51s]  I'm going to get it. Perfect. After that person speeds by the house as fast as they can.
[7923.51s -> 7948.26s]  Start from the top. Didn't get it. Didn't get it. It's okay. No, he went up the other
[7948.26s -> 7958.55s]  way. He went up the other way. Damn it. I thought he was going to go down. Get over
[7958.55s -> 7962.23s]  here. What the fuck was that shit? He walked to the right. What was that little juke to
[7962.23s -> 8037.86s]  the right? I can't fucking believe he went that way. Oh, God damn it. That game's a
[8037.86s -> 8051.80s]  lot of fun, but it's really hard. Okay. Where are we going? Gamer in his natural habitat,
[8051.80s -> 8065.62s]  making noise to attract his mate. That's one of those old arcade cabinet games.
[8065.62s -> 8086.49s]  It's a good one. All right. Um, Catacombs 3D. I believe this says gamer's edge,
[8086.57s -> 8115.64s]  the gamer's edge, apparently 54%. Thank you for voting. We're going to Catacombs 3D.
[8115.64s -> 8130.31s]  Here we go. Uh, it's gamer's edge. This looks like a bloody game is by id software.
[8130.31s -> 8140.54s]  If you're curious, this is like a doom game or video molds, CGA, EGA, VGA, um,
[8140.54s -> 8154.76s]  keyboard memory. I think this looks all right. Catacombs 3D, gamer's edge. It's a 1-800
[8154.76s -> 8164.68s]  number. id software. You know who those people are. It's high score. Joe, Steph, Sir Lancelot,
[8164.68s -> 8182.58s]  and Boombi. New game. Normal. Entering the approach. Oh, I can use the mouse.
[8187.70s -> 8194.10s]  Woe be to he that entereth my domain. Grem, Grelminar, the lich.
[8199.94s -> 8209.67s]  Whoa, I just threw a fireball. Path to keep. Okay. I guess I throw fireballs
[8210.23s -> 8217.80s]  and I can throw a nuke. I'm just going to queue it up the whole time. Just hold it.
[8220.50s -> 8250.89s]  Got him. Holy shit, that was creepy. It's like bullet travel. Keys, scrolls. Okay. A portal.
[8250.89s -> 8264.66s]  Actual Diablo portal. What's wrong with my face? Why am I wearing a... Okay, I'm in the keep.
[8269.64s -> 8286.55s]  The charge is the best. I hear somebody walking. Fire walls? Oops.
[8291.22s -> 8300.25s]  Chest over here. Potions? Help? Heals. Okay. There's just money in that chest.
[8300.89s -> 8322.52s]  Ooh, nukes. How does one use a nuke? Oh, that felt pretty good. Heals and nukes.
[8323.16s -> 8331.35s]  I hear somebody. And I got a key. Where is this person? They're freaking me out.
[8338.39s -> 8345.08s]  What is... I don't understand. Oh, here's the key. Let me check over here. Did I go this way?
[8347.27s -> 8361.08s]  Maybe H is to heal? H. H is heal. I want to get to the boss, at least.
[8369.03s -> 8375.53s]  That's my footsteps? I'm talking about this. That just means you can't go any further.
[8376.25s -> 8401.35s]  I have the key. I also got lightning bolt. Yeah, this is just operation. All right, key.
[8402.47s -> 8407.75s]  We're in here now. All right, next level. B for bolt. Well, I don't need it yet.
[8408.57s -> 8443.53s]  Is it N for nuke? Good. Two bolts. Three bolts. Motion sickness. Yeah, I'm getting it too.
[8444.33s -> 8459.80s]  I am getting it too. You're right. Why'd you say that? Now I'm getting it. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah,
[8459.80s -> 8472.01s]  you're right. It's bad. Eject. Eject. Eject. No, no. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I can
[8472.01s -> 8496.12s]  handle it for like another minute. This is the bad type of motion sickness. This game's fun,
[8496.12s -> 8505.40s]  though. It's a cool game. Spray and pray? I'm not spraying and praying. I'm landing shots.
[8506.52s -> 8520.86s]  Blue key. Out. Let's go. Anybody remember what anything was? Drop a nuke? I'll drop a nuke
[8520.86s -> 8533.67s]  before we leave. Here we go. Blue key. All right. I'm going to barf. All right.
[8535.19s -> 8544.66s]  I'm going to nuke and then I'm still alive though. I need red key. Just get it. Just
[8544.66s -> 8561.13s]  stand like a few feet away from your screen. Oh my God. That was bolt. Bolt's just rapid
[8561.13s -> 8574.82s]  fire. Big ball. I'm going to nuke the next person I see. Nuke. I'm hovering over it.
[8575.38s -> 8587.46s]  It just goes out around the whole room. Okay. It's very fun. This is a cool game,
[8592.66s -> 8599.85s]  but I think we have to move on before everyone pukes. You missed the nuke?
[8599.85s -> 8611.35s]  I can't do it again. Yeah. Okay. This is really cool though. I don't want to make
[8611.35s -> 8616.60s]  everybody puke because I'm like feeling it. That's a cool game. Cool. It is cool.
[8617.08s -> 8630.46s]  That was very, for how long ago that was? That's, you know, that's the titans of the video game
[8630.46s -> 8637.88s]  industry. Come on. So now we're going to go down. We're going to scroll for the first time
[8637.88s -> 8644.89s]  tonight, right? Oh no. Did we scroll before? No, no, no. For the second time. So we were here.
[8645.53s -> 8660.15s]  This is what we did. Now we're going to go down here. Here is, okay. So like right here.
[8660.87s -> 8675.43s]  There we go. Because that, oh, because Hocus Pocus, no, Hocus Pocus was up there. Right here.
[8676.07s -> 8692.23s]  Remember it's the text on the screen. So that looks, was House of Horrors up there?
[8693.50s -> 8696.62s]  I don't think it was. It's just weird that they're in such strange places.
[8698.71s -> 8715.98s]  That looks all right. All right. Are you ready? Please vote right now. Girlfriend
[8715.98s -> 8740.94s]  construction set. Oh God. Girlfriend construction. Resize the zoom. I actually, before the stream
[8740.94s -> 8745.82s]  started, I tried a bunch of stuff. I tried going zooming in and out. I tried refreshing. I tried
[8745.82s -> 8749.26s]  clearing cache. It's something about when you go down a few times, it just kind of does this.
[8753.08s -> 8757.02s]  All right. Well, this is girlfriend construction set. I'm going to, thanks for voting.
[8757.02s -> 8762.41s]  First of all, second of all, I'm concerned about this one because this could be a porn
[8762.41s -> 8804.06s]  game. Let's see. Um, let's see. Uh, start a new game. Enter your first name. I don't want to
[8804.06s -> 8809.02s]  put my real name. Bill. Enter the first name of the girl you wish to create.
[8809.74s -> 8825.02s]  Didn't they make a movie on this like a long time ago? It's not going to do Kim. Something
[8825.02s -> 8852.78s]  like, um, Janice. I don't know. Henrietta. Jen. How about just Jen. Select a face.
[8854.06s -> 8860.52s]  All right. I want like one, I think. I think it's going to be number one.
[8869.58s -> 8887.14s]  Definitely one. No, I'm picking this. It's one. Enter Jen's height. 60 inches is five.
[8887.86s -> 8900.55s]  I'm 62 inches guys. No, no, no, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. 60. What am I? What
[8900.55s -> 8912.78s]  is like five eight? No, that's five. That would be five two. Um, I'm like 60. What is it? 68?
[8917.29s -> 8928.33s]  That's five two. No, I'm, I'm, that's like, I'm 68 or 69. Just don't. So 60. We'll do 63.
[8938.42s -> 8969.43s]  Um, Jen's overall body rating is zero. How attractively does Jen dress?
[8969.51s -> 8979.51s]  Rubby. How trustworthy is Jen? Uh, seven. How often does Jen get jealous? Um, not really.
[8979.51s -> 8986.31s]  How would you rate Jen's personality? Very friendly. What's Jen's type of mood? Jesus.
[8987.03s -> 8992.44s]  Uh, seven. How well do you get along with Jen's friends and how well does she get along with
[8992.44s -> 8997.96s]  yours? They hate each other. Is Jen desperate to get married? Very desperate. What is Jen's
[8997.96s -> 9003.08s]  level of sexual activity? Oh, she can be a while. Um, I don't know, right in the middle.
[9004.09s -> 9015.35s]  Overall rating of Jen is 34. Bill's status points is 50. Date selected. Go out to dinner. Call
[9015.35s -> 9024.94s]  girlfriend. Jen, do you want to go out to dinner? Yes, I'd love it. You get to the
[9024.94s -> 9029.90s]  restaurant and find your table. After taking your order, the waiter returns and accidentally
[9029.90s -> 9039.78s]  spills soup all over your date's blouse. Jen says, oh, that hurts. You punch out the
[9039.78s -> 9043.62s]  waiter and get arrested. Jen waves at you as you are being fitted with handcuffs. Nice.
[9046.66s -> 9058.50s]  Get off me. Get off me. No, I'm gonna go to dinner. Yeah, I'd love it. You go to dinner
[9058.50s -> 9063.70s]  to a fancy restaurant. When you get inside, you see a really hot lady in a low cut dress.
[9063.70s -> 9074.33s]  You stare intently at her cleavage. Jen gives you a dirty look. She's not my type.
[9075.72s -> 9079.72s]  You sit down at your table while you're waiting for the waiter to come and take your order.
[9079.72s -> 9095.53s]  Jen reaches under the table and starts acting bored. You each have a very enjoyable dinner,
[9095.53s -> 9101.62s]  Jen asks. Do you want to order some rich fattening desserts? Sure, let's do it.
[9101.62s -> 9109.86s]  What happened? Can we do anything besides go out to dinner? You get to the restaurant
[9109.86s -> 9113.94s]  and the waiter comes over. Oh, excuse me. Oh, whoops, I spilled. Fuck you.
[9115.62s -> 9122.55s]  You get arrested. Get off me. Next week. You want to go to dinner? I'm sorry,
[9122.55s -> 9171.90s]  Bill. I can't go out with you anymore. You got dumped. No, no, no, no, 180. This person's
[9173.02s -> 9195.50s]  like a stick bug. Skeleton weighs more than that. I fucked it up. Okay, date list. Jesus.
[9196.22s -> 9205.94s]  Go horseback riding. That sounds like fun. Gene, do you want to go horseback riding?
[9205.94s -> 9217.11s]  I don't think so. Go skiing. Gene, do you want to go skiing in the Alps?
[9217.19s -> 9222.62s]  Okay. You and your girlfriend arrive in Switzerland and you hit the slopes. After a very active day
[9222.62s -> 9227.50s]  of skiing, you retire to the lodge and snuggle up to a warm fire. Just the two of you sitting
[9227.50s -> 9236.15s]  by the fire. Gene says, isn't this romantic? It really is. I suppose so. I guess so. Let's
[9236.15s -> 9246.33s]  just shut up. Let's go drink some dark beer. Um, I suppose. You two are sitting together
[9246.33s -> 9249.13s]  enjoying a moment of great intimacy. She looks long in the eye with glazed eyes,
[9249.13s -> 9260.65s]  then suddenly Gene sighs, let's get married right now. You're kidding? I don't think that
[9260.65s -> 9265.48s]  would be such a good idea at this time. I think we need... You two decide to get married and
[9265.48s -> 9269.80s]  have your honeymoon right there. Gene looks stunning in her beautiful wedding dress. She
[9269.80s -> 9281.70s]  brought the wedding dress with her on our first date. The happy couple lives happily ever after
[9281.70s -> 9286.68s]  in the suburbs for a few months. Eventually you both realize the marriage was a mistake.
[9286.68s -> 9294.38s]  You have more and more bitter fights. Finally, Gene divorces you and takes half your money.
[9294.46s -> 9332.17s]  Oh shit. Go to... How about go? She's an aunt. Go to the big party.
[9333.75s -> 9339.29s]  Jessica, do you want to go to the big party? No way, I'm not that dumb. Do you want to
[9339.29s -> 9344.47s]  go to the zoo? She's gonna get like licked up by a giraffe. No way, I'm not that dumb to
[9344.47s -> 9349.03s]  go to the zoo. You're not stupid enough to go to the zoo. What about the opera?
[9349.03s -> 9360.22s]  Do you want to go to the opera? I'm not that dumb. Um, do you, uh, you want to go
[9360.30s -> 9369.45s]  fly to Vegas for the weekend? No, I'm not that stupid. What is not stupid? Go to Hawaii for lunch.
[9369.45s -> 9373.91s]  No way, I'm not that dumb. These are all extravagant, incredibly expensive, insanely
[9373.91s -> 9383.34s]  awesome dates. Do you want to come over? No way, I'm not that dumb. Aren't we dating?
[9383.34s -> 9395.03s]  Aren't we... What are you talking about? Go to, uh, go mail strip joint. No way, I'm not
[9395.03s -> 9411.03s]  that dumb. No, I'm not that stupid. Go to dinner? No. Apparently that's not stupid,
[9411.03s -> 9417.91s]  it's just no. You want to go shopping? Forget it. You want to go to the bar? No, I'm not
[9417.91s -> 9422.14s]  stupid. Would you like to just, would you like to go to a rock concert? Some other time,
[9422.14s -> 9426.62s]  maybe. Would you like to go to a Broadway show? No, I'm, I'm smart. Would you like
[9426.62s -> 9429.66s]  to go to a party to one of my friend's place? No, I'm, I'm smart. You want to
[9429.66s -> 9434.22s]  play strip poker? No way, I'm not that dumb. Do you want to go fishing? Uh, no way,
[9434.22s -> 9438.46s]  I'm not, I'm, I'm very, fishing is for stupid, stupid idiots, huh? Uh, play strip
[9438.46s -> 9441.74s]  monopoly. You want to do that? No, no, monopoly's dumb, it's for dumb people. You
[9441.74s -> 9452.46s]  want to go to a hockey game? Hockey's not even, she likes hockey. You arrive at the
[9452.46s -> 9455.58s]  hockey game with your date. Early in the game, one of the players gets thrown into
[9455.58s -> 9462.06s]  the boards right near your seat. Jessica is startled and puts an arm around you impulsively.
[9462.06s -> 9473.91s]  Oh my fucking god. Oh my god. Uh, relax, it's fine. The game starts to get really
[9473.91s -> 9477.99s]  exciting. Someone almost scores a goal. Suddenly two players start fighting. Then
[9477.99s -> 9481.19s]  four players are going at it. Then the entire teams are fighting. The bench is
[9481.19s -> 9485.35s]  empty. All the players are out on the ice fighting. Then the crowd starts
[9485.35s -> 9490.63s]  fighting. A couple of bald guys with beer belly start punching away nearby.
[9490.63s -> 9495.03s]  One of them is thrown sprawling into you too. Jessica starts punching
[9495.11s -> 9507.80s]  with wild abandon. Why? Why would I do that? What? Aren't we on the same team?
[9508.70s -> 9521.82s]  We're on the same team. There's no reason for that. Just like, oh yeah, oh here comes
[9521.82s -> 9528.06s]  a big fight. Get him. Two bald guys are fighting us. Hey, honey. Wrong person.
[9529.24s -> 9532.92s]  What the fuck are you talking about? We're on the same team. She's punching.
[9533.56s -> 9544.30s]  No! Are you out of your fucking mind? We're on the same damn team.
[9544.30s -> 9552.31s]  That was certainly a messy scene. The hockey game is finally over. Neither of you has any
[9552.31s -> 9556.09s]  idea who won. Does it really matter? You both get back to your car while avoiding
[9556.09s -> 9561.78s]  the hyper drunk fans. Jessica remarks, hockey is really stupid. You're a moron.
[9571.18s -> 9577.94s]  Wasn't she just... She started fighting before I did. She was throwing punches before I even...
[9578.58s -> 9590.84s]  She was beating people up? Hey, want to come over to my place? She thinks over your offer
[9590.84s -> 9599.05s]  for a moment. Then Jessica says, no way. I'm not that kind of girl. Here, have a flower.
[9599.05s -> 9602.01s]  You pull up in her driveway and shut off the engine. She gets out of the car and you
[9602.01s -> 9612.30s]  follow her and walk to the door. She frowns and says, get lost. Okay. So long. So long. See
[9612.30s -> 9620.70s]  you later. Whatever. I can't win with you. I dump her before she dumps me. Quick. Yes.
[9621.18s -> 9634.49s]  So every idea is stupid. I don't want to go to dinner. Finally, I want to go to a hockey game.
[9635.05s -> 9641.64s]  She says, yes. Uh, the crowd starts fighting. She starts punching people in the face.
[9641.64s -> 9646.28s]  She starts beating people up. I joined the fray and I'm like, we're on the same team.
[9646.28s -> 9650.36s]  Hey, that was crazy. You're stupid. You're a moron. Okay. I'll drop you off. Loser. Get out
[9650.36s -> 9664.94s]  of here. We noticed what? What happened? I think we're going to have to, I think we're
[9664.94s -> 9670.55s]  going to close it on that one. I feel like we saw the best possible ridiculous scenario.
[9672.90s -> 9729.77s]  One more. All right. We'll do one more. One more. Um, eight. Okay. Overflow redo. I broke the game.
[9729.77s -> 9760.23s]  She's like, how tall is that? Jip. I broke it. Jip. Press any key. Deo rating is two. Okay.
[9760.23s -> 9767.45s]  Let's see. What do you want to do? How about let's go fishing? Um, I don't know. She's
[9767.45s -> 9774.68s]  going to be fly to Vegas for the weekend. No, it's not going to be hockey again. Let's
[9774.68s -> 9781.43s]  go scuba diving. I'd love to. Here we go. Good. You and your girlfriend arrive in
[9781.43s -> 9786.31s]  Cozumel, Mexico and hop on a boat for some exhilarating scuba diving. After carefully
[9786.31s -> 9790.23s]  checking the equipment and reviewing the fundamental rules of diving, you dive off
[9790.23s -> 9795.83s]  into the deep and do some exploration and practice some buddy breathing. After a very
[9795.83s -> 9800.63s]  active day of diving. She's such an active woman, isn't she? During which you both get
[9800.63s -> 9805.19s]  quite wet. You retire to the villa and have a little siesta. Just the two of you.
[9805.27s -> 9815.05s]  Jaxette says, isn't this romantic? Uh, Jaxette is also, I think, uh, two to three,
[9815.05s -> 9824.41s]  about two to three hundred feet tall. Let's go have some like beer. You two are sitting
[9824.41s -> 9828.09s]  together enjoying a moment of great intimacy. She looks long at you with glazed eyes and
[9828.09s -> 9838.98s]  suddenly Jaxette blurts, let's get married. You two decide to get married and have your
[9838.98s -> 9845.59s]  honeymoon right there. She looks ridiculous in her rented wedding dress. The happy
[9845.59s -> 9849.03s]  couple lives happily ever after in the suburbs for a while. Eventually you both
[9849.03s -> 9851.99s]  realize the marriage is a mistake. You have more and more bitter fights. Finally,
[9851.99s -> 9891.90s]  she divorces you. Oh, well, uh, let's go. Four. Uh, that, that's fine. Why? What are
[9891.90s -> 9921.11s]  you talking about? I can't distribute. Uh, I don't know, 30, 25, 26, uh, 20, 20,
[9922.25s -> 9927.59s]  23, 25. I don't know. I don't, I don't, there's no such thing as a perfect
[9927.59s -> 9936.60s]  person. Okay. I can't, I don't have any points left. Okay. Let's go to,
[9937.16s -> 9949.50s]  let's go bowling. That's easy. Are you kidding? No way. Go baseball game. Sure.
[9949.50s -> 9955.86s]  Okay. Baseball. You can, there's no fights in baseballs. You arrive at the stadium with
[9955.86s -> 9961.69s]  your girlfriend and sit down in your nice, comfortable box seats on the third base side.
[9962.63s -> 9966.63s]  Perfect. Goes off and buys t-shirts and caps and spends 50 bucks.
[9966.63s -> 9974.04s]  Concentrate on the game. Concentrate on the blood. A few seats away. Concentrate on your
[9974.04s -> 9980.33s]  girlfriend. Read the program. Don't concentrate. It's too hot for that. Uh, let's concentrate
[9980.33s -> 9985.48s]  on, concentrate on the girlfriend. You and your girlfriend are sitting drowsily in the hot
[9985.48s -> 9990.92s]  sun. The game is dragging on. A slow reliever is on the mound. It takes about 10 minutes to make
[9990.92s -> 9996.84s]  each pitch. He winds up 10 minutes later. He pitches. It's a well-hit ball. Foul up the
[9996.84s -> 10000.12s]  third base line. The ball was coming right at you. And before you can quite realize what's
[10000.12s -> 10009.61s]  happening, you've caught it. Ouch. Ouch. Baseball. I like baseball. What's wrong with
[10009.61s -> 10014.31s]  baseball? All right. So I caught the ball. Give the ball to your girlfriend. How sweet.
[10014.31s -> 10023.00s]  Hurl the ball at her head. I keep the ball. Hurl the ball at the old lady. Three bros away.
[10023.00s -> 10030.71s]  Throw the ball at the blonde. Hurl the ball at the third base. Why is this just weirdo,
[10030.71s -> 10059.08s]  like fucking psycho simulator? Nothing happened. We went home. I have no idea.
[10059.64s -> 10065.11s]  How about come over and go- oh did we drop some frames? Yeah we did.
[10066.22s -> 10073.51s]  Come over and go in the swimming pool. I'm sorry I can't go out with you anymore. You've
[10073.51s -> 10083.75s]  been dumped. I don't know. Swim at. It's in your name. You have to like swimming.
[10085.51s -> 10100.79s]  Six? Where's six? Sure. Face negative 14. What? Come over and go swimming in the pool.
[10102.44s -> 10114.49s]  No way. I want to go swimming. No way. Hot tub. This is gonna be another one of these.
[10115.22s -> 10118.74s]  I have to restart the game to get somebody to- okay I'll restart it.
[10118.74s -> 10127.26s]  Let me just physically go like this. You lose status points when you get dumped. I see.
[10127.90s -> 10151.67s]  I think I broke it. I may have broke the game. All right here we go. New game. My first name.
[10151.67s -> 10158.54s]  Okay. No not like swim at again. How about just like- I don't know.
[10172.60s -> 10182.76s]  Tiffany? How about Tiffany? Okay Tiffany. Tiffany. Okay let's get it. 62.
[10183.40s -> 10187.40s]  I don't know. 130. Measurement in inches. I don't know these.
[10192.02s -> 10203.54s]  Uh overall ratings are three. Okay you dress- all right. A trustworthy. Very trustworthy.
[10204.10s -> 10206.58s]  Tiffany doesn't really know. Doesn't get jealous that often.
[10207.30s -> 10213.46s]  Personality. Friendly. Very friendly. Uh happy. How long do you get along with Tiffany's friends?
[10213.46s -> 10223.99s]  Get along well. All right let's go. I want to go swimming. You don't want to go swimming.
[10223.99s -> 10241.53s]  I want to go in the hot tub. Uh let's just drip monopoly. Local beach.
[10243.67s -> 10254.06s]  Forget it. Why? Horseback riding. Sounds like fun. Here we go. Finally.
[10255.34s -> 10260.38s]  You go horseback riding with your girlfriend. You follow the trails at the old west riding
[10260.38s -> 10265.56s]  stables. You bounce up and down on your horse and your balls start to get sore.
[10268.90s -> 10272.58s]  Your girlfriend seems to be used to it though. She knows her horse well.
[10272.58s -> 10275.94s]  Very very well in fact. What? After riding for a couple hours,
[10275.94s -> 10279.70s]  Tiffany says this is so exhilarating isn't it? Sure whatever you say.
[10279.70s -> 10285.85s]  You're right. That's what I think. Grab your- grab your girl. Aren't we on the horse?
[10288.22s -> 10297.51s]  Yeah you're right. That's what I think. That's it. Let's go horseback riding again.
[10298.52s -> 10316.78s]  Okay grab your horse. Is there any other options? I think that's it. Let's fly to
[10316.78s -> 10324.47s]  China for dinner. Why would you fly to China to go to dinner? What kind of like
[10324.47s -> 10330.86s]  billionaire are you? What better place to enjoy fine Chinese cuisine than China itself?
[10331.72s -> 10335.96s]  You fly to the capital city of China and eat at one of the finest outdoor restaurants
[10335.96s -> 10343.54s]  in Tiananmen Square. You decide to order Chinese food. Okay. The food arrives and you both dig in.
[10343.54s -> 10372.81s]  Tiffany says I just love Chinese food. I don't get it. Wait. Wait hold on a minute. You
[10373.93s -> 10378.25s]  suddenly- wait why? Wait wait wait wait wait a second. Wait a second. This is not good.
[10378.25s -> 10404.20s]  You've run around- wait this is hundreds of- troops storm the area. You look all- I gotta
[10404.20s -> 10418.78s]  get out of here. What the fuck? What? What? Um um get out of this. Out. Out. Out. Out.
[10423.40s -> 10441.56s]  Get us out. Out. Get us out. No no no no no. What the fuck is this? Dude I- I can't.
[10441.56s -> 10463.91s]  This is fucked. Oh my god. You've got to be fucking kidding me. I just wanted to- oh
[10468.66s -> 10493.77s]  that's so terrible. I don't want to- no I'm out. I'm out. God damn it. What the fuck?
[10494.33s -> 10527.34s]  Throw it into sub- throw it into sub mode quick. No mods? Oh shit. Well that was um-
[10527.34s -> 10531.26s]  I'm a little shocked at the thing that we just witnessed. It was fucking kind of
[10531.26s -> 10536.23s]  ridiculous. It was very ridiculous actually. Uh we're moving on from that one. I ain't gonna
[10536.23s -> 10555.22s]  play that one anymore. So let's go. Here's the list again as you see. I think we have one more
[10555.22s -> 10577.00s]  or two what? Two more here. So um okay. Wait this is not right. Uh bingo sunshine thanks
[10577.00s -> 10588.94s]  to the five community subs. Appreciate it. Thank you for that. Five community subs coming
[10588.94s -> 10595.27s]  in. Thank you. That was um girlfriend construction simulator or whatever the hell
[10595.27s -> 10607.67s]  that was. Girlfriend construction set. We have I believe one more here to do. Please vote when
[10607.67s -> 10622.17s]  you get a chance. We just did- I'm not going back and playing that again. No. I'm not going
[10622.17s -> 10641.00s]  back and playing it. I'm not doing it. Not happening. I have to pee too. Two more. Two more
[10641.00s -> 10649.11s]  yeah. All right whatever it is I will- it looks like it's gonna be roadrunner. So when
[10649.11s -> 10655.80s]  I come back from taking a piss we will open up roadrunner and we'll play it. Be right back.
[10661.34s -> 10665.75s]  I ain't gonna let you get that. You know I'm not gonna leave with the clicks on the screen.
[10666.31s -> 10842.04s]  Be right back. All right here we go. Roadrunner. Let's get it done here. 1989.
[10842.04s -> 10856.15s]  This is probably gonna be a side scrolling video game. If I were to take a random guess
[10856.15s -> 10873.62s]  that's what it would be. Best roadrunners. Roll. Play when using the keyboard. Okay so
[10873.62s -> 10882.26s]  KP789. What is this? Instructions. Demo. Redefine keys. So this is- it's the number pad.
[10886.31s -> 10895.32s]  $50 just came in from Amferik. Thank you so much Amferik for the huge amount of money
[10895.32s -> 10900.95s]  and you had community subs earlier too. Thank you. Yeah we can- we can- we can- what's
[10900.95s -> 10910.92s]  happening? Wait, wait, wait. What's going on? Oh okay. You can take it off sub only. But
[10910.92s -> 10913.72s]  thank you for the 50 bucks Amferik. Just want to say thanks for the streams and all the
[10913.72s -> 10918.70s]  content over the years. I'm pretty sure I've always almost died from laughter too much during
[10918.70s -> 10922.54s]  some of these streams but totally worth it. You deserve all the support you get so keep doing
[10922.54s -> 10931.37s]  you. Thank you. I'm gonna keep doing it. We're gonna keep doing- I'm gonna keep doing it as
[10931.37s -> 10937.35s]  long as I possibly can. Let's press escape to play the game. But thank you so much for the
[10937.35s -> 10945.05s]  50 bucks. That's a lot of money. Wile E. Coyote and there's me. That's a pretty- that's
[10945.13s -> 10957.94s]  you know that's a cute emote version of these characters. What does jump? Let's get the bird
[10957.94s -> 10964.10s]  seed. Roadrunner you missed a seed. Roadrunner you missed a seed. You get hit by a car?
[10965.30s -> 10976.10s]  I know I missed a seed but what about what do? I got five. That's- I need five right?
[10983.74s -> 10988.34s]  Well he- we both got run over so does that really matter?
[10989.06s -> 11007.99s]  All right let me get the end of this. Peepo dance. It's hard to see the cars just coming
[11007.99s -> 11011.11s]  out of nowhere. There's like not even a foot in front of the screen to see where the cars are
[11011.11s -> 11025.06s]  coming from. Can you jump the cars? Maybe it's just spam jump. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!
[11025.78s -> 11058.66s]  Don't go down down down down! That's so hard to do. Okay oh god again. Down down quick
[11058.66s -> 11081.82s]  get up! What's wrong with him? Why is he drunk? I missed 18 bird seeds.
[11103.40s -> 11108.23s]  No go this way. Why is he going over there? This is so fucked up.
[11114.70s -> 11141.21s]  What the fuck? Why? I'm laughing for a very specific reason and I can't even say anything.
[11142.01s -> 11153.10s]  The numpad are the controls. I can't even play this. This game is fucking stupid.
[11164.76s -> 11174.50s]  All right. Rude. I mean yeah rude but you have nine different buttons for up, down, left,
[11174.50s -> 11196.65s]  and right. Nine. All right here we go. Oh I fucked it up. Sorry. I opened it in a tab last
[11196.65s -> 11205.26s]  time. Why did I do this? All right so we have one more to pick from this list. Please pick
[11205.26s -> 11217.56s]  it. I wish you luck. Hopefully you pick something good. Let's see what you get. One, two, three.
[11219.06s -> 11233.67s]  Please vote if you can. And remember only click on something if it is on the screen like text
[11233.67s -> 11248.39s]  on the screen. So 20% of you just don't want to be counted as a vote. That's okay. And
[11248.39s -> 11266.63s]  you guys want me to play Qbert? You actually want Qbert? Dude I had this sick tattoo I was
[11266.63s -> 11271.26s]  gonna get. You guys would have thought it was fucking awesome. Dude it was gonna be Qbert
[11272.41s -> 11278.74s]  with like weed eyes and he was gonna have a joint like on his hand. It's gonna be fucking
[11278.74s -> 11306.02s]  so awesome. All right let's play Qbert. New tab. Qbert is a very old one. For all you guys
[11306.02s -> 11311.22s]  talk like making fun of the boomer shit you certainly do pick the boomer games.
[11311.22s -> 11324.01s]  All right press space to play. I think it's just to jump on the Qbert is. If I remember you just
[11324.01s -> 11333.14s]  have to turn the yeah no up. You have to turn them all the other colors right? Yes you need
[11333.14s -> 11351.37s]  to change everything to that. So how do I move? Is it space? How do I why can I not jump?
[11352.58s -> 11363.06s]  Number pad? Use your mind. Um let me try it again. I'll try it down on number pad.
[11363.06s -> 11375.42s]  Oh okay there we go hold on. So it is like the what's weird it's one and one three what are
[11375.42s -> 11388.17s]  you doing? Can I all right what's I think it's one three seven nine. Let's try it again.
[11388.17s -> 11398.09s]  Yeah it's one it's definitely it's one three seven nine. Let's go on the numpad.
[11403.00s -> 11424.39s]  That is Qbert. Oops I was looking at chat. Okay I got really I got really bored for a second.
[11429.35s -> 11434.55s]  I don't know what it was man. It was like ultimate hyper boredom for five to tenths of a second.
[11434.55s -> 11451.88s]  Here we go. I like to do this technique with Qbert. Go down in the middle here.
[11461.58s -> 11490.63s]  No I try to hit seven. Let's give me a controller god damn it. I'm sorry I can't play
[11490.63s -> 11496.25s]  this game with two hands. I'm up I'm up playing Qbert with two hands on the number pad.
[11496.89s -> 11502.73s]  You know what I mean like put your put your hand on your numpad and like seven nine one
[11502.73s -> 11516.63s]  three. It's like I'm like playing the guitar. I can do that just fine. I don't I don't believe
[11516.63s -> 11526.71s]  that because you have to you have to go from seven to one it's too it's a long way. If you
[11526.71s -> 11530.55s]  need to go up and then down left it's like seven then you have to go all the way down.
[11530.55s -> 11548.66s]  Now I can play that. Put one finger on each button. Yeah but that's what I'm saying I
[11548.66s -> 11555.46s]  don't want to do. What do you mean one finger up. Do I have a claw like index thumb?
[11556.57s -> 11570.66s]  What are you gonna claw the numpad? You're gonna claw the numpad. It's not gonna happen.
[11570.66s -> 11574.70s]  You're gonna accidentally press like two buttons at the same time and then you're gonna go what
[11574.70s -> 11586.57s]  the fuck? What the fuck? One of you probably just did it. I'm just on camera so you get to
[11586.57s -> 11597.03s]  see me do it. I'm thinking about getting like a tattoo of Qbert with like wicked fucking weed
[11597.03s -> 11604.94s]  eyes and he's got like a fucking Guinness in his hand. You know what I mean? Where are we
[11604.94s -> 11628.95s]  going? Does anybody have any clicking? I'm not gonna do girlfriend construction set again.
[11628.95s -> 11654.10s]  Okay we got King's Bounty or we got Bruce Lee. King's Bounty. This is the last one.
[11654.10s -> 11661.99s]  Did three already? Did we? Did we? Oh no we did girlfriend construction. Oh fuck! Uh oh.
[11670.15s -> 11679.18s]  Ladies and gentlemen we're gonna have to go here with uh yeah Qbert didn't count. That's
[11679.18s -> 11694.09s]  true. We're gonna do Bruce Lee. Yeah I didn't play. Qbert didn't count. My hands hurt too
[11694.09s -> 11698.49s]  much when I play it. It's too much pain. I'm gonna throw my fingers. All right let's do
[11698.49s -> 11710.97s]  Bruce Lee. Weed. Oh yeah thinking about getting like weed. TV set on composite. I don't know
[11710.97s -> 11731.70s]  what that just said but okay. This game sounds like it's underwater. Play versus computer
[11732.42s -> 11753.06s]  or Terminator. Let's just try this. Is something wrong with the game? Is this thing fighting
[11753.06s -> 11777.94s]  me? This one hurts. This one hurts more than Qbert. I think I lost. Can I climb?
[11777.94s -> 11795.34s]  This probably looks better on a CRT. Oh absolutely. Just like in the movie. All right I can't look at
[11795.34s -> 11813.96s]  it. I can't look at it anymore. Okay so it is time to scroll. Two games that don't count
[11813.96s -> 11820.74s]  equals one game that counts. So all right so where are we going? We're here. We're going down
[11821.75s -> 11847.38s]  here which gets us to this. Like right here should be good and that should get us in a good
[11847.38s -> 11855.11s]  spot. Remember if there's no text on the screen it's not going to do anything.
[11870.90s -> 11894.94s]  What the fuck is this? So it looks like Ford Simulator 5.0. I don't know why you'd have
[11894.94s -> 11905.90s]  four other versions of this game but it seems like that's where you guys want to go.
[11905.90s -> 11915.88s]  We had some Sim Life. There's some good ones on here. There are some good ones on here.
[11915.88s -> 11935.26s]  You're right. All right we're gonna do Ford Simulator 5.0. Pretty good graphics for a DOS
[11935.26s -> 11955.00s]  game. Here comes a gigantic advertisement. This whole game is going to be an ad. Probe. Tell us.
[11955.96s -> 11969.75s]  Spec it. Paint it. See profile. Drive. All right spec it. Crown Victoria just picks the car.

[12023.62s -> 12029.77s]  How about a Mustang? Let's get a Mustang. What? I don't want that. That's what I want?
[12029.77s -> 12036.22s]  I want a Mustang. Paint it. Okay. Let's see what we can get with different colors.
[12036.78s -> 12056.46s]  I think my browser crashed. Nope. Hmm. All right. What about like Bumblebee? All right.
[12056.46s -> 12096.82s]  Looks good. Hey, I just painted it. Paint it. Is it painted? Canary-o-o. Drive. Uh, beginner.
[12096.82s -> 12108.09s]  Do you want sound? Of course I do. Choose a vehicle. Mustang. You are on the road and ready
[12108.09s -> 12117.53s]  to go. The objective is to get to Lake Wakatanka as fast as possible. Accelerate. Up. Okay.
[12117.53s -> 12137.50s]  Steer, brake, and then shift is space. Why can't I just? I'm trying to shift. Gas maps food
[12137.50s -> 12160.34s]  one mile. I'm so hit by a truck. Shift up. Shift into second gear. Oh god.
[12166.09s -> 12178.15s]  Oh god. Fifth gear. I'm 90. They're trying to. I clocked you at 32 miles per hour. Over the
[12178.15s -> 12183.77s]  limit. I hate to do it, but I'm going to have to write you a ticket. Uh, sorry officer.
[12184.49s -> 12210.07s]  I won't do it again. Have a nice day. You're gonna have to write you a ticket. Uh,
[12210.07s -> 12222.07s]  that's too bad. I'm only listening to instructions to get there as fast as possible.
[12222.71s -> 12226.31s]  It didn't say follow the rules of the road. It didn't say take your time. It said get
[12226.31s -> 12246.70s]  to Wakatanka as fast as possible. I'm sorry. I'm listening to instructions. I gotta go like over
[12246.70s -> 12266.74s]  a hundred. Come on. 98, 99, 100, 102, 105, 110, 110, 100 and fucking 20. Oh, damn it. I
[12266.74s -> 12270.74s]  clocked you at two miles per hour over the limit. I'm going to get a ticket for going
[12270.74s -> 12279.22s]  like 35 and a 30. Like a 30 what? You're going to clock me at like 32 miles per hour
[12279.30s -> 12290.39s]  and a 30. You were going 42 and a 40. What? You're gonna get a ticket for that?
[12303.14s -> 12310.14s]  Your average speed was 16 miles per hour? No, I don't want to do that again. All right,
[12310.14s -> 12323.21s]  I had enough. Let's go back. I don't need to do any more of this. All right, let's go again.
[12325.64s -> 12342.84s]  Where are we going? We've got some good ones here. Sim Life, Wheel of Fortune, Doom 2,
[12351.70s -> 12367.29s]  Neuromancer, Sim Earth. We seem to be split, but Sim Life I think is going to be the victor here.
[12367.29s -> 12390.52s]  Give it another few seconds. Five seconds left. I think we're good. 31% of the vote. That's a lot.
[12390.52s -> 12408.44s]  Sim Life. This is by Maxis, one of the old ones. One of the old Maxis games. All right,
[12408.44s -> 12423.82s]  I don't think I've ever played this before. 1992. This is not, that's not a real animal.
[12423.82s -> 12431.24s]  That is a snake with a grasshopper's body and bird feathers. And there's a toucan butterfly.
[12432.20s -> 12437.34s]  This could be good. I'm looking forward to this now. Oh, fuck, this looks like a lot.
[12440.62s -> 12445.34s]  Experimental mode. Do whatever you want. Craft your own plants and animals and let them loosen
[12445.34s -> 12450.62s]  a world of your own design. Or pick various species from the zoo to inhabit your experiment.
[12450.62s -> 12454.84s]  Can you establish a food chain? When will disasters strike? You play a scenario.
[12458.20s -> 12463.94s]  All right, let's, I wonder how hard this is. If you're new to Sim Life, why not try out the
[12463.94s -> 12468.26s]  tutorial? There's no particular scenario to solve. You've got the basic features of the
[12468.26s -> 12479.64s]  game. Okay, let's just, you know, let's just check it out. Sim Ant. Jerma lied about Minecraft
[12479.64s -> 12486.82s]  VR. Five community subs. Lots of community subs tonight. Thank you guys. And thank you
[12486.82s -> 12494.31s]  to Jerma lied about Minecraft VR for the five drop. Thank you. Welcome to Sim Life tutorial.
[12494.31s -> 12499.27s]  To quit the tutorial, select new game from the meta, the meta end menu. Use tutorial menu
[12499.27s -> 12502.87s]  to repeat a message at any time to go to the next message instead of waiting for it.
[12503.99s -> 12510.78s]  Okay, so just let's go. Is that my animal? Another five community subs just came in from 1914.
[12513.86s -> 12524.33s]  Five more subs. Thank you. Five more community subs. Fuck yeah, thank you. Sometimes I was
[12524.33s -> 12530.02s]  asked to click a button. I'm usually okay. Yeah, sure. All right. So day, not as a day
[12530.02s -> 12537.27s]  night cycle. Yeah. Okay. Can you tell me what to do? The whole days are going by.
[12541.16s -> 12548.28s]  More. Gnarly gave five community subs. Even more. Yeah. Now they're just coming in
[12549.14s -> 12554.97s]  like, okay, there's another, there's five from Gnarly, 10 from Cyclops Parker. Jesus.
[12556.38s -> 12561.54s]  Thank you. All of you guys for these insane amount of subs, chaining them together.
[12563.02s -> 12574.57s]  Thanks for the 10 Cyclops. That's fucking thank you. Here we go. There's a mutagen button. Okay.
[12574.57s -> 12579.43s]  Help button is right into the yellow and black mutagen button. Yeah. Dashboard, whatever.
[12579.43s -> 12582.39s]  It's just like, Hey, you can click help and click help and click help and click.
[12582.39s -> 12592.78s]  What else am I supposed to be doing? 10 more just came in from MGS fan and DJ
[12593.59s -> 12608.47s]  Conde. Thank you. Both of you. What is going on? I thought this is supposed to be a tutorial.
[12608.47s -> 12621.75s]  Five more from Tingy. Thank you, Tingy. Hold on. Let me just new game for a second. Hold on.
[12623.08s -> 12634.73s]  So hold on a second. Help. Terrible lizards. Let's see what it looks like.
[12640.44s -> 12643.08s]  Look at all these fucking community subs coming in. Oh my God.
[12644.18s -> 12651.45s]  10 more from JermaLightAboutMinecraftVR. Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[12651.45s -> 12655.26s]  So you can switch them. All right. So look at this. We can make.
[12658.10s -> 12666.52s]  Oh my God, guys. Five more. 10 more. Five more from Jill Crungus. Oh man. Look at this
[12666.52s -> 12683.99s]  thing. It's like a donkey starfish. Low intelligence herbivore. Donkey starfish
[12683.99s -> 12694.18s]  with a snake tail. Nating difference. This thing is called the triceratops.
[12695.82s -> 12705.70s]  That's not right. Food, source, plants, nectar. Okay. I feel like this is a very
[12705.70s -> 12710.95s]  elaborate simulation. You probably have to be here for a while. What about the other
[12710.95s -> 12717.35s]  animals? You guys are still going. Nat five community subs. Multi-trip five community subs.
[12717.35s -> 12725.43s]  You guys are still. This is like a legit sub train right now. You guys are fucking
[12725.43s -> 12734.04s]  going nuts. Thank you to all of you. That's like 100 community subs that just threw in
[12734.04s -> 12747.94s]  here right now. Thank you guys. Make it so. Let me go back out here. Tool. What is this?
[12747.94s -> 12759.37s]  I can mutagen. Build world. Click on any of the control names for help messages when you
[12759.37s -> 12763.29s]  have set parameters as you prefer. Okay. You can do like. You can make a new world.
[12764.38s -> 12772.31s]  Add more lakes. More. You can just change the parameters. It's interesting. Barriers,
[12772.31s -> 12784.46s]  mutagens, toxins. No, I don't want to do that though. Nevermind. Oh my fucking God.
[12791.10s -> 12794.86s]  I have nightmares about these kinds of animals. 20 community subs from Ampharic.
[12795.58s -> 12807.91s]  Ampharic dropping hundreds of dollars tonight. Thank you so much Ampharic. 20 more.
[12808.55s -> 12822.57s]  What is this? You can like paint five more from 420 squid. We are just going all out community
[12822.57s -> 12833.58s]  subs right now. You can do custom art. Thank you guys for real. Like this is fucking ridiculous.
[12833.58s -> 12836.86s]  Anytime you guys do this shit I just can't even believe it. Thank you everybody.
[12838.65s -> 12845.62s]  Big Saturday subs coming in. I'll be honest. I feel like this is going to take a while
[12845.62s -> 12851.61s]  to like kind of do a lot of stuff. This seems kind of like sim ant where you need to
[12851.61s -> 12860.23s]  have like some time and just watch things grow and stuff. It seems like a fun simulation though.
[12863.70s -> 12873.93s]  Wait, pterodactyls? I can do sea urchins in water. Make it so. Oh shit. It seems cool but
[12873.93s -> 12880.81s]  might take a while to do something interesting. Yeah, this seems pretty cool. I just think I
[12880.81s -> 12882.89s]  feel like it would take a while for me to figure out everything that's going on.
[12885.75s -> 12891.70s]  But I'm going to move on from this one. It does seem very interesting but I think
[12891.70s -> 12898.44s]  I wouldn't want to stay here and put that much time into it. But very, very, very cool.
[12898.92s -> 12913.69s]  Let's come back here. Let's do it again. That was sim life.
[12919.24s -> 12935.86s]  A hundred percent. That's a lot for wow. Here comes the fight. Will of Fortune, Doom,
[12936.50s -> 12942.25s]  and Neuromancer. Do Neuromancer you normies.
[12946.46s -> 12960.30s]  Why? What is it? Why? All right. There's no coming back from this. 66%. There's no way.
[12961.00s -> 12967.42s]  Will of Fortune it is. This is a DOS version of Will of Fortune. This could be
[12968.22s -> 12971.18s]  all over the place. It could be really good or really bad. Let's find out.
[12977.18s -> 12982.58s]  What is this? This is a song. Why is this some Will of Fortune?
[12982.58s -> 12993.50s]  Hit any key to begin. That's what I'm trying to do. Okay, here we go.
[12993.50s -> 13001.46s]  We of Fort. How many players? One. Are you a returning champion? No. I have to earn it.
[13001.46s -> 13024.01s]  Please enter your name. Okay. Round one. What do we got? It's an event. Your choice. Spin.
[13024.01s -> 13035.59s]  Time remaining. Spin. Spin it. I'll lose it on. All right. Enter a letter. Let's go with E.
[13036.23s -> 13048.78s]  Oh, fuck. You have to buy vowels. Oh, no, no. I forgot you had to buy vowels in this game.
[13048.78s -> 13062.34s]  And you went bankrupt, Brian. Who cares? Yeah, this sound kind of hurts. T. There's one T.
[13062.34s -> 13081.24s]  Something the. They the. They. Time to. It's an event. Time of the. Time of the. Turn of the
[13081.24s -> 13114.78s]  century. I win. Turn of the century. I'd like to solve the puzzle, please. I win. Turn of
[13114.78s -> 13127.11s]  the century. I got 200 points. Round two of 200 points. Oh, yeah, I forgot. It's not about
[13127.11s -> 13135.48s]  winning. It's about getting letters and points. Oops. So I just look like an idiot. I'm
[13135.48s -> 13156.31s]  just a dickhead. Okay, this is people. Don. Chris. I don't know. I only got 200 points.

[13232.62s -> 13239.32s]  it back to me. These people are stupid. U is a vowel. I'm not going to do that again.
[13239.32s -> 13268.63s]  It's not runners. Spin the damn wheel. P. T. T. I'm going to say T. Okay. Thomas. Tom.

[13313.32s -> 13344.79s]  Oh, this is people. The Texas Rangers. All right, here we go. I got 1200 points. No,
[13344.79s -> 13359.58s]  it should have said team. This is a title. Well, it's definitely the T. It's going to
[13359.58s -> 13378.41s]  be a bunch of Ts. That's nice. The time of the Lord. No, it's not the Lord of the Rings, guys.
[13378.41s -> 13401.62s]  There's a D at the end. The word of the Lord. I think it's the word of the Lord. I think it is.
[13401.62s -> 13409.86s]  The word of the Lord. That's what I'm going with. That was only one D. The time of the
[13409.86s -> 13431.26s]  Lord. The land of the Lord. No, the work of the Lord. Why hasn't even T yet? It's free
[13431.26s -> 13445.94s]  points. T is actually free points. So let's see if it's the. The something of the. So H,
[13445.94s -> 13478.52s]  we'll do H. Let's just game those points. The. H. The. The. W. The word of the Lord. No, the,

[13518.86s -> 13541.27s]  what it is. It's called a while. I'm not reading answers in chat. Everybody read this book in the

[13899.58s -> 13904.73s]  use your free spin. All right. I'm going to go L because it's Michael. And then the rest of
[13904.73s -> 13914.54s]  all, it's just it's all vowels. There it is. All right. What, I get 300 points? Yeah. All

[14165.94s -> 14171.90s]  over and going like, I'm just guessing. I have no idea what's happening. And that A.E.E.A.
[14171.90s -> 14184.89s]  thing. I, I don't, I wouldn't fuck that up too. Sorry, Pat. Better like next time.

[14325.42s -> 14336.74s]  O. Fort. Foot. It's definitely an O there. It has to be. No. That's a fucking vowel,
[14336.74s -> 14352.07s]  you motherfucker. I keep, I don't know why. I just keep thinking it like will
[14352.07s -> 14380.44s]  automatically buy it. I have to press the button. Now that we've got love. Now that not.
[14380.44s -> 14407.74s]  It's definitely now. Okay. Now that the, that the is. Let's get the, let's get the S.
[14407.74s -> 14428.57s]  Because it definitely is. Now that the sh. Now that the shoe. Uh, put this on puzzle please.
[14428.57s -> 14439.62s]  Now that the shoe is on the other foot. I would have had that fucking long ass time ago.
[14439.86s -> 14448.81s]  I just keep forgetting you have to buy the vowel. It's like, oh, would you like to buy that vowel?
[14448.81s -> 14474.23s]  It just deletes your turn. All right. I want the boat. This is a person. It's a person. But
[14474.23s -> 14496.79s]  is that the pope? Um, the. I'm not going to do T or H because I know it's the. But it might,
[14496.79s -> 14518.34s]  there might be T somewhere else too. I'm going to do P. S. S. There's a lot of places
[14518.34s -> 14557.24s]  for S's here. Uh, R. H. B. No, I always do B. P. D. There's lots of like does. One more. P.
[14558.42s -> 14569.08s]  And then want to say then that's five consonants. Lock it in. And I'm going to say either E or I.
[14570.07s -> 14591.02s]  E. Always E. So it's the. The. Pop. The. Prince. The poor. The pre. The press. The press.
[14592.47s -> 14616.14s]  The push press. The purr. Peer. The prez. The prize. T. The far. Parish. Parish. Free. The
[14616.14s -> 14654.97s]  priests. No, there's no T. No. Pray the parish pre. So what was it? I had it right. I was
[14654.97s -> 14679.50s]  reading chat and I thought it was wrong. Yeah. I thought I just, I didn't want you to think I
[14679.50s -> 14699.34s]  was cheating. I'm closing chat now. I'm not even going to look at it. I'm putting you guys
[14699.34s -> 14751.13s]  out here. T. T. A. Attached. Let me see. No C's. A. T. T. A. C. H. E. No. Title of B's.
[14751.69s -> 14801.38s]  I'm going to say N. A. T. T. E. Ten. Let's spin it again. What has two T's in the
[14801.46s -> 14844.79s]  beginning? Um. M. Let's think of something. Um. R. I'm going to say R. There's always an R.
[14846.01s -> 14854.78s]  Always. Oh, come on. Why is it even on there? Out of all the dumb game show things, why is it
[14854.78s -> 14881.29s]  bankrupt on the wheel? Just make it zero. P. No. Do an R. If I get bankrupt again,
[14881.29s -> 14897.42s]  I'm going to harden, turn off the computer with the power button. I think I know what it
[14897.42s -> 14919.00s]  is. But I want points. Yeah, I know what it is. I want a G. Solve, please. I know what it
[14919.00s -> 14943.54s]  is. The Attorney General. There's no way you could ever have attorney be up there. What a
[14943.54s -> 14956.73s]  district attorney? Attorney? No, that's what you guys are saying about me. You're
[14956.73s -> 14964.09s]  polite about Attorney General. That's the first thing I see. All right, you guys can
[14964.09s -> 14971.35s]  stay up here now. Okay? How's that sound? Fake typing. You don't know what you're talking
[14971.35s -> 14992.31s]  about. Put us back down there. Place. Person, place, thing. This is the last attempt and
[14992.31s -> 15005.03s]  we'll do something else. We'll do another one. Nancy going with D. Some D. Door? Door
[15005.03s -> 15023.37s]  to the old. Door to the old mall. Door to the old wall. Door to the old. Dawn of the
[15023.37s -> 15037.45s]  old. Door, Dawn. Well, let's just, we'll do T because it's definitely up there.
[15037.45s -> 15045.21s]  If that's, middle one's that. Door of, Dawn of the old will and testament. Um,
[15045.21s -> 15062.26s]  Dawn of the, spin it. Let's H. Don't bankrupt. Don't do it. Spin it again. Dawn
[15062.26s -> 15081.00s]  the old will. Mall. F. Wait, I already checked. Who did F? I was so confident that it was F.
[15081.00s -> 15092.71s]  Somebody else did F. I didn't even fucking realize it. It's Dawn. Dawn. Oh, no. It's
[15092.71s -> 15115.08s]  Dawn out. Dawn to. Dawn is. Dawn on. Down B. Down B. Dawn B. The old. Down. Down. Door.
[15115.80s -> 15136.39s]  Dawn B. The. Down. It's Y. It's going to be Y. By the old. What's the, what is the last one?
[15136.39s -> 15148.94s]  Down by the old mill? Will? Bill? Down by the old mill? What's the last word? Down by the old
[15148.94s -> 15167.40s]  mill. By the old mill. Uh, I don't know. Bankrupt. Bankrupt. Mike is killing it.
[15171.27s -> 15192.60s]  So definitely W. Down by G. Where would G go up there? Down by the old mill.
[15192.60s -> 15214.65s]  Well, let's get it up there so I get points. Cram. Stram. What's even left up there? P. R. K.
[15214.65s -> 15241.19s]  J. E. It. Down by the old mill. Stram. Down by the old. It's the job I have. Streamer. Nice
[15241.19s -> 15248.50s]  acting. You guys do understand that. It doesn't matter what happens. I could type this in
[15248.50s -> 15254.63s]  first try like I did before and I would have read it from chat somehow. You can't play a
[15254.63s -> 15264.62s]  game like this. You always, I always have to be cheating. Always. Every time. I'm going to win
[15264.62s -> 15276.02s]  this one. Just cheat anyways since no one will ever believe you. That's true. That's a good
[15276.02s -> 15281.30s]  statement. I'm just going to watch the chat. No I'm not. Because I want this to be my win.
[15281.30s -> 15310.41s]  It's a thing. Superman. Stew. Um, something stew. Succotash. Stew. Something stew. It's a
[15310.41s -> 15319.70s]  food. It's like something stew. Something stop. Something stew. I went fucking bankrupt
[15319.70s -> 15336.71s]  again. I get it almost every time. This is a thing. Come on Nancy. Bankrupt. Lose a turn.
[15336.71s -> 15356.14s]  Bankrupt. Anything. Something bad. Right there. Door. Stir. Stir. Stir. Eye. But what sir stir?
[15356.14s -> 15404.02s]  Something stir. Something stir. It's an eye. Stir. Suh. Something stir. Stir. Screen peeker.
[15404.02s -> 15410.15s]  All I'm doing is peeking at the screen. I'm cheating. I can't cheat on this one. Bonus
[15410.15s -> 15416.31s]  round. Get the boat and that's it. We're done. Here we go. This is an event. I, you guys, nobody
[15416.31s -> 15418.87s]  can say anything. You can't say I'm cheating because I'm gonna do it right now. Here we go.
[15418.87s -> 15428.73s]  An event. It's uh T. B. Uh G. H. Uh L. Okay. Done. And uh E. You can't tell me I fucking
[15428.73s -> 15437.82s]  cheated now can you? Here we go. E. E. E. Got a lot of E's. Tons of E's. We've got L's. P's.
[15437.82s -> 15519.27s]  E. We hope you enjoy your 17 foot fishing boat. Oh man that's so fucking funny.
[15521.00s -> 15530.36s]  Where the hell are we? We're down here. So that was it right? That was three. Ford, Wheel of Fortune,
[15530.36s -> 15549.03s]  and uh Sim Life. And we have to do Doom as well. Ford sucked. Why are we doing three?
[15549.03s -> 15555.58s]  We do three and then we scroll. So we're gonna follow the rules guys. We're gonna follow the
[15555.58s -> 15567.80s]  rules. That means we're gonna scroll. Ford sucked. It didn't count. I liked Ford. Should
[15567.80s -> 15575.11s]  I just do like a streamer's choice and play this? The rules are dumb. Chat picks three
[15575.11s -> 15579.51s]  games that they want to see and then we scroll down. There's four thousand, there's four
[15579.51s -> 15587.53s]  thousand three hundred of these. All right I'll do, I'll, I'll do streamer's choice
[15587.53s -> 15609.43s]  because I'm curious what this is. Neuromancer. Load game one two one. You're at the cheap
[15609.43s -> 15624.49s]  hotel. I have 753 dollars. Uh okay. Packs. Items. I have 758 credits. Guest pass on the
[15624.49s -> 15631.58s]  cyberspace two. Packs. Public access system. Free side. Skill chips. Oh no. Send
[15631.58s -> 15641.72s]  die. Verification code. I'm in. Uh first time packed user info. Access banking
[15641.72s -> 15650.86s]  interlink. Uh first orbital bank of Switzerland. A name. Data Dan. Uh I download
[15650.86s -> 15659.16s]  credits. Um download fucking like five thousand of them. Thanks. Thanks for the
[15659.16s -> 15677.82s]  money. All right let's go. What else we got here? Cop talk? Ice breaking.
[15677.82s -> 15695.61s]  Cryptology. Microsofts. Can I go in sewer? Shins. Let's go this way. Can I go like
[15695.61s -> 15710.81s]  can I change my cursor to go in somewhere? Pawn shop. Metro holographics.
[15710.81s -> 15728.07s]  Is there am I missing a function here? Disk options. What was that?
[15728.07s -> 15731.19s]  Holy shit. I missed some subs here. Jeremy lied about Minecraft VR. Just
[15731.19s -> 15750.07s]  gave a ton. Was it 20 community subs? Move along citizen. Streamers choice. Yeah
[15750.07s -> 15753.03s]  well everyone told me everyone would want to be to play this.
[15753.03s -> 15755.27s]  So I wanted to check it out because I thought it was gonna be cool. It still
[15755.27s -> 15757.51s]  is cool. What's wrong with this? It's nothing wrong with this.
[15757.51s -> 15768.84s]  What's wrong with this? It's interesting. Uh could decide by which
[15768.84s -> 15777.21s]  company are you employed. You're at the maximum security gate.
[15777.21s -> 15795.67s]  I got 5700 bucks. Is that enough? I feel like I'm missing something here.
[15795.67s -> 15807.24s]  Guest pass. Operate item. Guest pass? Go back over here.
[15807.24s -> 15811.72s]  I'm a volunteer for a Hitachi biotech. Sorry I just stumbled in here by
[15811.72s -> 15817.53s]  mistake. I work for. I'm a volunteer. What?
[15817.53s -> 15829.69s]  I have to put. Do I not know the company? I work for
[15829.69s -> 15842.71s]  Microsofts. All right can I talk? Apparently not. Can I go in
[15842.71s -> 15856.60s]  some of these buildings? Cyberspace. What's cyberspace 3?
[15856.68s -> 15864.14s]  Exit. Erase software. Blowtorch? No no don't erase.
[15864.14s -> 15875.96s]  No no no no. Operate item. Battle chess. It's a boomer open world game. It's not.
[15875.96s -> 15884.86s]  It every wow you got everybody so quick to be angry at these choices.
[15884.86s -> 15888.06s]  First it was play neuromancer and then it's get out of neuromancer and
[15888.06s -> 15906.55s]  then it's go in and as you get out it's which one is it.
[15906.55s -> 15909.19s]  All right well I can't figure out what to do so we're gonna move on.
[15909.19s -> 15915.29s]  Seemed like a cool game. Before everybody was extraordinarily upset that
[15915.29s -> 15935.11s]  I clicked it for more than four minutes. All right coming back. So that uh we're
[15935.11s -> 15948.02s]  gonna do a scroll. So we were here. So now we're gonna go from here down
[15948.02s -> 15956.63s]  to get to here. So we've got. Robocop is not up there. So this is
[15956.63s -> 15970.20s]  what we got here. That looks correct. Right there should be
[15970.20s -> 15975.72s]  good. Right there. Uh right yeah we had
[15975.72s -> 15981.02s]  colonization was on the last one so right there looks good. Which is hard
[15981.02s -> 15985.90s]  to line it up correctly. All right here we go.
[15985.90s -> 16006.15s]  Let's see what you guys want to do. Give it a click.
[16006.15s -> 16016.95s]  Wheel of fortune's not currently on the list. You can't click it. So we got
[16016.95s -> 16021.48s]  the incredible machine. Lemmings 3D. Big business and monkey
[16021.48s -> 16030.74s]  island 2. Incredible machine is the one that's
[16030.74s -> 16033.40s]  being picked. So that's what we're gonna do.
[16033.40s -> 16040.01s]  Thank you for voting. It's winning by a lot.
[16040.01s -> 16046.50s]  So I don't think anyone's coming back from that one. The incredible machine.
[16052.39s -> 16065.69s]  Oh this is what you make think of Rube Goldberg right? Original Sierra game.
[16065.69s -> 16075.64s]  Okay it's like mousetrap. We're gonna make let's make mousetrap.
[16075.64s -> 16082.34s]  Puzzle one tutorial. Put the ball in the hoop.
[16082.34s -> 16087.34s]  Make the basketball go through the hoop. Sure thing.
[16087.34s -> 16092.66s]  Okay so um let's play it. Make this is the hoop I'm assuming right? Make
[16092.66s -> 16104.90s]  basketball go into the hoop. So we need uh do we just place them?
[16104.90s -> 16114.84s]  Wait wait wait wait. What are the what are the controls here? It's a
[16114.84s -> 16125.77s]  ramp like this. You make this bigger? Now first of all how do I like start
[16125.77s -> 16128.81s]  start machine? Okay let me just see what it does already. All right so that's
[16128.81s -> 16135.13s]  what that does already. So like let's clear it.
[16135.13s -> 16142.09s]  So this has to land and like knock into this one.
[16142.09s -> 16148.36s]  Okay what does this one do? What is this? It's like a
[16148.36s -> 16154.90s]  machine? Power? What do I need power for?
[16154.90s -> 16160.14s]  Does it have these bands? This is to move the balls right?
[16160.14s -> 16167.85s]  So this is to power a generator. And then do I have to attach the
[16167.85s -> 16174.44s]  bands here? You know what I'm saying? Like does this is like does this I
[16174.44s -> 16180.38s]  I don't know what one's supposed to do. So does this like have to be
[16180.38s -> 16183.02s]  attached to here or something for like it to work?
[16183.02s -> 16202.18s]  Okay how do I turn this on? How do I power that? Oh damn okay hold on.
[16202.18s -> 16212.65s]  Is this for wine? So then now this has to go.
[16212.65s -> 16235.10s]  I have two of these. Okay so I get it. Gotta be closer.
[16235.10s -> 16241.40s]  No no no what the hell? Why? All right don't ever right click. So now
[16241.40s -> 16244.36s]  it's going to be bang. He rolls over there, bang. He rolls over there, bang and
[16244.36s -> 16246.60s]  that. Okay there's only difference though.
[16246.60s -> 16249.72s]  This is not this could be closer. How does it have to hit the top? I
[16249.72s -> 16260.47s]  can hit anywhere. It works. All right and then you go
[16260.47s -> 16269.69s]  like this. You go like this. Done. Started.
[16269.69s -> 16277.02s]  End of the hoop. Ding ding. New password.
[16277.02s -> 16283.10s]  Do you want to advance to the next puzzle and replay your solution?
[16283.10s -> 16289.75s]  Advance. I know I'm kind of getting the idea here.
[16289.75s -> 16293.27s]  All right put both bowling balls into the metal baskets.
[16293.27s -> 16297.11s]  To solve this puzzle you must place and flip the mouse cage
[16297.11s -> 16302.74s]  and then hook up the pulley belt to the conveyor belt.
[16302.74s -> 16306.68s]  Place and flip the mouse cage and then hook up the pulley and the
[16306.68s -> 16311.54s]  conveyor belt. Okay so you get these both have to go in here.
[16311.54s -> 16315.83s]  This one's already going. So that's that's it.
[16315.83s -> 16329.45s]  So now they'll both just go in right? Oh no somebody. Ah no no no. I have to drop
[16329.45s -> 16333.94s]  this here. This is easier than the tutorial.
[16333.94s -> 16350.79s]  I did it. You must pop all the balloons.
[16350.79s -> 16358.02s]  All right so let's just see what these do.
[16358.02s -> 16362.10s]  So the ball hits the you gotta blow it into the scissors.
[16362.10s -> 16378.22s]  Okay so we need one of these down here. Flip it and then this one's
[16378.22s -> 16381.51s]  got to do the same thing. Flip this one
[16381.51s -> 16384.55s]  because this thing can get destroyed by the
[16384.71s -> 16397.06s]  wheel. Tied up. Yes. Oh flip it.
[16397.06s -> 16409.38s]  You've achieved IQ up 68 to 69. Hey good. Hooray.
[16409.38s -> 16413.62s]  My IQ leveled up. That's great. Make the bowling ball fall off the bottom of
[16413.62s -> 16416.68s]  the screen. That's the bowling ball. What happens
[16416.68s -> 16422.18s]  right now? So we boink and that boinks.
[16422.18s -> 16429.37s]  Yeah I think I understand what you want me to do here. And then get this
[16429.37s -> 16441.78s]  one down here. So
[16441.78s -> 16448.82s]  see if that goes far. How far does the last one go? And then
[16448.82s -> 16458.09s]  knock that one and then do it again. Okay so this has to be flipped.
[16458.09s -> 16466.78s]  This looks pretty awesome though. This is good shit.
[16466.78s -> 16488.38s]  This is really good shit. All right let's see.
[16488.38s -> 16492.36s]  Oh we might be off a little bit on the physics here.
[16492.36s -> 16498.18s]  Maybe. No I think we're okay. And out.
[16498.18s -> 16505.22s]  Yeah sounds like Donkey Kong Country 3. Yeah I'm getting Donkey Kong Country
[16505.22s -> 16512.57s]  vibes. You're right. Use the boxing gloves to punch the
[16512.57s -> 16518.66s]  baseball up to the metal pipes. Punch the baseball up to the metal pipes.
[16518.66s -> 16523.14s]  What happens right now? This rolls. That punches.
[16523.14s -> 16530.54s]  So we got let's see. So we got basketball punches that ball.
[16530.54s -> 16537.29s]  This ball goes down here. This ball needs to be punched.
[16537.29s -> 16540.41s]  So actually hold on. That shouldn't. Can I move things?
[16540.41s -> 16557.14s]  I can't pick anything up that's already there. Can I put this here?
[16557.14s -> 16566.31s]  Because that drops going. I almost feel like I should put this up.
[16566.31s -> 16574.70s]  Should it just go up and over? What does this do?
[16574.70s -> 16590.44s]  No not quite. What do I do with this thing? Because it is it has to be
[16590.44s -> 16595.51s]  activated to punch. Yeah it has to go up over there
[16595.51s -> 16597.99s]  because then this has to punch this one right?
[16597.99s -> 16611.16s]  I hate when it does that. Can I flip this? Like
[16611.16s -> 16614.44s]  where can this go? No I can let go left and right.
[16614.44s -> 16631.56s]  So that was probably that was correct but it just needs to go higher.
[16631.56s -> 16642.58s]  I just learned this last puzzle. Literally one ike. I'm just like
[16642.58s -> 16648.42s]  yeah I just did it. But like this has to go doesn't have to go up.
[16648.42s -> 16653.46s]  Hold on what if I do here? Can I do it up and like over again?
[16653.46s -> 16672.04s]  Like what if I do this? Oh stop! Flip and then put it under the
[16672.04s -> 16678.02s]  black ball. I didn't think I could fit it here.
[16678.02s -> 16680.66s]  I tried I tried to put it here before. I didn't think I could even
[16680.66s -> 16684.55s]  fit it. Yeah I would have done that first.
[16684.55s -> 16692.82s]  It's just I didn't think it would it didn't look like it didn't fit.
[16692.82s -> 16696.10s]  Yeah I didn't think that was gonna fit down here. Just look at it. See the
[16696.10s -> 16699.24s]  white? It's like going over the I didn't
[16699.24s -> 16708.63s]  think that was gonna fit. All right well now I'm gonna go like
[16708.63s -> 16730.36s]  this. Punch the ball. Go for it. Too far.
[16730.36s -> 16746.20s]  Just far enough. Make Mort the mouse run in his cage!
[16746.20s -> 16763.80s]  Spring. I'm just doing random placement. You gotta use all four.
[16764.63s -> 16768.31s]  Where did it bounce to? Let's see right there.
[16768.31s -> 16795.27s]  Right there. Further in. Further in. Yes. Is that gonna reach? I don't think it's gonna
[16795.27s -> 16799.54s]  reach. Oh fuck it's not. Okay so it's gonna
[16799.54s -> 16806.66s]  be a little bit further. Can I move this one a little bit?
[16806.66s -> 16813.03s]  Each one is like one to the right.
[16814.25s -> 16823.85s]  Hmm not really. Lower? Now does it
[16823.85s -> 16827.82s]  I wonder it doesn't matter how far it falls.
[16827.82s -> 16852.04s]  No see I don't think steeper is gonna be better. Yeah it's definitely lower.
[16852.04s -> 16863.53s]  How far does it go the first time? No so there's actual physics in the game.
[16863.53s -> 16867.54s]  That's what I was wondering. So it will fall if the more it falls.
[16867.54s -> 16871.46s]  It's a DOS game. I don't think it had like actual real physics in this.
[16871.46s -> 16896.41s]  That should do it. All right we'll do one or two more.
[16896.41s -> 16902.06s]  Make the jack in the box break the fish bowl. You got it.
[16902.06s -> 16907.06s]  Jack in the box. Let's just see what happens right now. Okay.
[16907.06s -> 16912.87s]  There he goes. So we just set to make the jack in the box happen.
[16912.87s -> 16917.06s]  Goes up. We got two jack in the boxes here.
[16917.06s -> 16925.45s]  What does this do? Pretty good hand breaking here. Yeah.
[16925.45s -> 16930.15s]  So it just jumps up and that bounces over here which will turn
[16930.15s -> 16956.22s]  this. Let's see here. Oh god the right. Okay why even have a right click?
[16956.22s -> 16965.78s]  Oh no right here. Do it again. Spin spin spin spin spin spin spin spin
[16965.78s -> 16975.22s]  spin. Break the tank. We killed the fish.
[16975.22s -> 16982.71s]  All right a couple more. Like one or two more. That's it. Pop the balloon.
[16982.71s -> 16987.62s]  Note that you must flip the windmill to select which direction it turns.
[16987.62s -> 16992.26s]  Pop the balloon. What happens? Okay we got
[16992.26s -> 16996.55s]  a windmill. Are the windmills just wind?
[16996.55s -> 17001.85s]  Sure it is Jeremy. There's no power here though so you have to do
[17001.85s -> 17012.87s]  I wonder if there's a way. Wait is it can I connect this to this now?
[17012.87s -> 17016.23s]  Every genre. There's a lot of tracks in this game strangely enough.
[17016.23s -> 17020.90s]  What does this do? Do I need to place this in this particular place because
[17020.90s -> 17024.18s]  do I have to like hit it with something? Does it have to spin?
[17024.18s -> 17026.82s]  It does. Okay so you need to have the wind spin so you have to put one of
[17026.82s -> 17037.10s]  these down here which will spin that. You have to
[17037.10s -> 17040.58s]  hit it with something. So this has to go over here and then
[17040.58s -> 17048.02s]  push this for that to move over here. I'm generating clean energy.
[17048.02s -> 17052.60s]  All right well I can move this one. That doesn't really do anything.
[17052.60s -> 17060.23s]  Another windmill to push that all the way? Will this move?
[17060.23s -> 17068.92s]  Hold on a second here. Let me just do this. Can I move this one too? No
[17068.92s -> 17074.31s]  just that one. Because then this has to be tied to
[17074.31s -> 17078.15s]  this windmill right? I'm gonna bring this back over here
[17078.15s -> 17086.89s]  which moves it that way. So I need to flip this.
[17086.89s -> 17091.53s]  You go all the way over there that drops and then in the meantime
[17091.53s -> 17098.30s]  that will hit this windmill. Not windmill this thing.
[17098.30s -> 17104.94s]  Spin it that way. Attach the cord. And we should have a finished product.
[17104.94s -> 17121.62s]  No no we won't. Wrong way. Now it's a finished product.
[17121.62s -> 17124.58s]  Oh it was in the right spot at the beginning.
[17124.58s -> 17145.74s]  Nice. This is fun. This is a fun little game.
[17145.74s -> 17149.18s]  Your goal is to lower all three buckets. To do this you must cut both
[17149.18s -> 17153.37s]  ropes with the scissors. So we're gonna cut all the
[17153.45s -> 17157.45s]  ropes with the scissors. Gonna drop the buckets.
[17157.45s -> 17164.01s]  What happens? Just drops. Lower the buckets. Cut the rope.
[17164.01s -> 17168.73s]  So just out of curiosity. Will that cut if I...
[17168.73s -> 17175.14s]  Okay so that cuts two of them. So we need to have
[17175.14s -> 17188.06s]  our scissors here. Gonna cut them both so we need
[17188.06s -> 17207.16s]  like this. Because that'll just drop right? I think that's it.
[17208.04s -> 17211.48s]  You're right. Every genre of music is in the game.
[17211.48s -> 17217.42s]  Gun. All right. Bang. Bang. You must shoot all three guns.
[17217.42s -> 17222.54s]  Shoot the guns. You have to pull the... Okay that shoots.
[17222.54s -> 17232.02s]  So we have... You have to tie the gun to a rope.
[17232.02s -> 17243.02s]  Rope to something else. Bucket. I mean let's see. You gotta get this
[17243.02s -> 17246.92s]  to here to there and then we have one more of these. There aren't even more
[17246.92s -> 17251.38s]  buckets though. All right so what happens first? Oh
[17251.38s -> 17256.73s]  that just shoots. That's it. Hold on. Wait a minute.
[17256.73s -> 17260.41s]  Can I just like buck this whole thing up and just do it stupidly?
[17260.41s -> 17275.02s]  Too far away? I wonder if I can just do this just dumb.
[17275.02s -> 17288.38s]  All right you can only have one. You can go here. That should work right?
[17288.38s -> 17310.54s]  Something has to weigh this down. Other side. There's this balloon.
[17310.54s -> 17319.38s]  What's the balloon for? How do I... I want to get this back.
[17319.38s -> 17326.94s]  Is this enough tension to do this? On the other side?
[17326.94s -> 17332.28s]  There it is. Yeah! All right. I'll do like...
[17332.28s -> 17338.84s]  I'll do like a couple more. And then we're going to move on.
[17338.84s -> 17348.44s]  So this is uh turn on all the fans. You must flip the light switch to
[17348.44s -> 17353.96s]  provide power to the electrical plug. The initial state of all plugs is off.
[17353.96s -> 17359.32s]  So we have to turn on all the fans. Power is power.
[17360.60s -> 17367.96s]  Okay so we gotta do this. I mean we've got to bounce the ball because
[17367.96s -> 17372.30s]  it's turning it off. And then where does that go? A fan
[17372.30s -> 17374.46s]  maybe?
[17375.58s -> 17381.91s]  Because that's just gonna flick it on and then the fan will...
[17381.91s -> 17385.91s]  Well you probably... Will this blow into here?
[17385.91s -> 17396.49s]  What if I... I need power for this though don't I? I don't have to connect
[17396.49s -> 17416.87s]  these? What happens if I do this? There we go.
[17416.87s -> 17427.38s]  That flicks that up. That flicks that up and then the ball
[17427.38s -> 17438.57s]  is... gets blown. It's almost like the ball...
[17440.06s -> 17444.54s]  Because then this blows over here but what do I do with that?
[17444.54s -> 17455.78s]  The ball powers this which blows the balloon which then knocks into there.
[17455.78s -> 17461.35s]  Well how do I get this one to stay on? Can I just blow this
[17461.35s -> 17469.08s]  from here? No I can't. Maybe I can. Let's see if it'll just do it. That's
[17469.08s -> 17477.00s]  flicking it away. That's... Oh. I thought that was turning it off.
[17477.00s -> 17491.91s]  Never mind. Okay. They all started off. Yeah I know but
[17491.91s -> 17494.47s]  when you see it in practice it's like wait
[17494.47s -> 17504.26s]  shouldn't the foot switch be up? All right this is the last one
[17504.26s -> 17509.99s]  and then we're gonna move on. We'll do like one or two more games.
[17509.99s -> 17513.75s]  Make the tennis ball fall down into the pipe hole. Generous will take
[17513.75s -> 17520.57s]  turning motion and provide electricity. Electric motor must be plugged in to run.
[17520.57s -> 17537.19s]  Okay so going going so these I need more cowbell. Actually hold on don't
[17537.19s -> 17550.14s]  do this. Can I not move that? Can I have another fan?
[17550.14s -> 17562.86s]  Excuse me. Uh all right no wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.
[17562.86s -> 17573.05s]  Not enough. Not enough power to get that to blow this way.
[17573.13s -> 17591.27s]  I mean it kind of is but not really. Um windmill connected to here.
[17591.27s -> 17594.79s]  The thing is though I knew what what did these do again? I kind of just glazed
[17594.79s -> 17610.74s]  over when I was reading that. Windmill to power the generator but
[17610.74s -> 17614.46s]  hold on back it up. I want to read that again.
[17614.46s -> 17617.02s]  I like I just read it out loud without even comprehending what was
[17617.02s -> 17627.05s]  going on. How do I like go back? Is there a way to go back? Because
[17627.05s -> 17629.77s]  I just just two new items that I just
[17629.77s -> 17632.17s]  didn't even comprehend what they were doing.
[17632.17s -> 17650.65s]  I just I can't do it. Right click. Oh right. All right make the tennis ball
[17650.65s -> 17654.33s]  fall down. Generators will take turning motion
[17654.33s -> 17659.86s]  and provide electricity. The motor okay so this is a running
[17659.86s -> 17664.04s]  man. So this is a generator. So what the
[17664.04s -> 17673.56s]  hell is this? The electric motor? Which one of these is what is this is
[17673.56s -> 17683.74s]  a motor now? Full Jupiter. That's pretty good.
[17683.74s -> 17693.10s]  All right so this is this one is powered already.
[17693.10s -> 17704.17s]  So I don't need this because it's plugged in. How do so will this spin?
[17704.17s -> 17708.89s]  That spins this. Does this need to be do I actually need to
[17708.89s -> 17715.16s]  connect this? This movement the windmill turns from here
[17715.16s -> 17725.64s]  which in turn will that turn? No. All right get this off
[17725.64s -> 17733.72s]  because then that probably okay now this will power that which then will
[17733.72s -> 17737.85s]  power the
[17737.85s -> 17759.16s]  this. What is this thing for? This powers the switch.
[17759.16s -> 17763.48s]  Does this need to be plugged in? What does this thing do?
[17763.48s -> 17770.65s]  What's the other fan for? The ball the ball needs to be
[17770.65s -> 17782.26s]  because now this is powered. So that's a generator and then this is
[17782.26s -> 17789.70s]  now has power for me to attach to this which will then knock
[17789.78s -> 17801.19s]  oh it's gotta be the other way then hits that which then bounces
[17801.19s -> 17816.55s]  okay so then this this goes over here and how do I power that? The rat runs
[17816.55s -> 17821.46s]  but just can i power i can't power the fan with the rat can i
[17821.46s -> 17858.68s]  no i can't put that up there and this needs to be near a switch
[17858.68s -> 17865.93s]  oh this comes with a plug i didn't think this came with a plug
[17865.93s -> 17869.05s]  i thought you just had to pump it in okay well that makes it
[17869.05s -> 17895.16s]  that's all right okay over here that was fun
[17895.16s -> 17906.12s]  did it hooray all right that's it that's it for bad rats the prequel
[17906.12s -> 17913.18s]  i just uh for some i didn't think there was gonna be an outlet attached
[17913.18s -> 17916.62s]  all right we are gonna do uh one more
[17916.62s -> 17933.67s]  compare this to bad rats i mean it's just i was kidding
[17933.67s -> 17940.18s]  let's go over here all right let's do we have
[17940.18s -> 17947.14s]  what was that the first one so we probably two more then because that was
[17947.14s -> 17952.81s]  the first one in that list so we'll do two more
[17952.81s -> 17956.17s]  that should take us to about six hours
[17956.17s -> 17965.00s]  which is where i was probably gonna end in any way so
[17965.00s -> 17975.61s]  all right here we go that was the incredible machine that was fun
[17975.61s -> 17981.18s]  little interesting little game so we've got
[17981.18s -> 17988.95s]  these here right i feel like these are moving
[17988.95s -> 17997.61s]  all right here we go one of the final two of the night which one is
[17997.61s -> 18024.18s]  it gonna be big business is where the scroll is on
[18024.18s -> 18038.73s]  chat just always clicks girl 37 percent how many votes are in
[18038.73s -> 18049.22s]  all right looks like we're going to big business thank you for voting
[18049.22s -> 18064.98s]  let's try it digitech software presents
[18064.98s -> 18072.63s]  making fucking cash uh all i need is 50 bucks
[18072.63s -> 18080.87s]  i'll turn that 50 dollars into 50 000 i'm just gonna invest in gold
[18080.87s -> 18093.06s]  and then wait 500 years this game work oh big business off the wall
[18093.06s -> 18101.86s]  productions desk so i'm the chairman if you have a
[18101.86s -> 18104.42s]  halo above your head you're obviously a bad guy
[18104.42s -> 18108.70s]  somebody did somebody just what's going on why people falling
[18108.70s -> 18115.14s]  why why are people falling why are people doing that
[18115.14s -> 18123.67s]  uh okay desk about b biz all right do you have freaking me out
[18123.67s -> 18130.68s]  start game the fortune three player one has twenty four thousand dollars we all
[18130.68s -> 18138.79s]  start with 24 000 wake up it's your turn is a board
[18138.79s -> 18143.03s]  game do i have to what is it three minutes on the
[18143.03s -> 18147.74s]  clock too much caffeine can make you nervous
[18147.74s -> 18155.48s]  oh no borrow repay profit losses you left the vault open and someone
[18155.48s -> 18161.35s]  took thirty five thousand dollars what
[18161.35s -> 18171.56s]  what who did i have no money raw material purchase gravel
[18171.56s -> 18180.58s]  sand lime uh i have uh i've lost so much money sand
[18180.58s -> 18200.95s]  buy sand sell gravel sounds good how do i get out of here escape
[18200.95s -> 18205.66s]  okay so what do you do production cement
[18205.66s -> 18211.53s]  factory production schedule rates 67 percent
[18211.53s -> 18219.88s]  they make a million units okay what about
[18219.88s -> 18228.86s]  einstein does einstein do anything research and development
[18228.86s -> 18234.62s]  rats what do i do with what do i do in our r&d
[18234.62s -> 18243.32s]  gravel raw material needed in production i need sand lime and gravel
[18243.32s -> 18255.40s]  all right easy enough improve r&d let's do a mill was that
[18255.40s -> 18263.98s]  a billion dollars how much was that that's 10 million dollars how do i
[18263.98s -> 18279.45s]  get worst and i can't i'm getting like
[18279.45s -> 18296.54s]  stuck in menus why is it a sound all right this guy's
[18296.54s -> 18305.72s]  gonna give me some good info here so is this sales advertising but
[18305.72s -> 18310.73s]  advertising what what are we advertising i have seven
[18310.73s -> 18315.59s]  seconds until what the room explodes i don't
[18315.59s -> 18320.82s]  understand what's going on it's after four go home will you
[18320.82s -> 18335.43s]  okay i'm going player two's turn so we're competing
[18335.43s -> 18355.38s]  borrow borrowing money i lost 35 grand player three production i'm losing yeah
[18355.38s -> 18358.10s]  i'm losing because somebody robbed my vault in the first 10 seconds of the
[18358.10s -> 18369.59s]  game oh my god buy buy buy buy
[18369.59s -> 18383.69s]  r&d a million trading for gravel is this us why are we getting mr
[18383.69s -> 18388.20s]  fantastic arms buyer sale player three units transferred
[18388.20s -> 18392.78s]  what's happening do i have to put do i have to buy

[19866.20s -> 19869.30s]  what's going on the remaster was bad yeah i remember
[19869.30s -> 19876.81s]  they kind of redid it let me just hold on i gotta look at a
[19876.81s -> 19883.90s]  calendar this saturday so we did we went thursday friday
[19883.90s -> 19886.70s]  saturday i have i need to take three days
[19886.70s -> 19895.96s]  off from my colonoscopy let you know it was his will do
[19895.96s -> 19899.80s]  so this exactly one week from today is
[19899.80s -> 19904.76s]  my appointment the day before i can't do anything
[19904.76s -> 19908.60s]  and maybe potentially it depends on how i feel about the day after it should be
[19908.60s -> 19911.16s]  okay but at least friday and saturday i won't
[19911.16s -> 19914.94s]  be live so what we'll probably end up doing
[19914.94s -> 19922.60s]  here is i'll come back on
[19922.60s -> 19926.52s]  we'll do tuesday wednesday thursday and then
[19926.52s -> 19937.98s]  probably sunday that sounds about right but i just need to look at it
[19937.98s -> 19940.06s]  on a calendar tuesday because then they'll give me
[19940.06s -> 19947.88s]  the day there so tuesday i can tell you exactly what
[19947.88s -> 19950.92s]  we're doing tuesday we're gonna finish sam and max
[19950.92s -> 19954.49s]  we'll at least try to get you know a couple episodes in because i was
[19954.49s -> 19957.59s]  supposed to do it yesterday and the day before but it
[19957.59s -> 19960.95s]  all the internet bullshit stopped it from happening that was really the
[19960.95s -> 19970.94s]  start up when it got real bad and then wednesday and thursday
[19970.94s -> 19983.30s]  maybe i'll maybe i'll play my magic now i'm really into that
[19983.30s -> 19993.48s]  those of you that don't know what it is it's really interesting
[19993.48s -> 19997.66s]  yeah so then yeah we'll do tuesday wednesday thursday sunday
[19997.66s -> 20005.24s]  that's probably what's gonna happen all right let me zoom back in here because i
[20005.24s -> 20009.48s]  was gonna go tomorrow too but i feel like that taking the days off
[20009.48s -> 20015.16s]  would because then i would be that would be four days in a row

[20018.49s -> 20021.29s]  all the internet bullshit i think that plays out better doing it here

[20026.25s -> 20036.58s]  fucking following me around today he said well it's getting late

[20078.94s -> 20081.66s]  just hit the road in the archive with sam and max hit the road i don't
[20081.66s -> 20085.48s]  think so yeah i want to do this i want to do

[20093.62s -> 20102.09s]  i think that's it for tonight aren't you glad you gave them 400 gold
[20102.09s -> 20112.17s]  now you got me excited end of the stream voice

[20120.31s -> 20124.12s]  it's gonna be fucking awesome we're gonna get we're gonna get
[20124.12s -> 20130.79s]  through so much cool shit in that game
[20130.79s -> 20151.83s]  but that was dos saturday hope you enjoyed it i did let me see
[20151.83s -> 20157.00s]  cool this should do the bits and the subs and everything should take us to
[20157.00s -> 20159.82s]  six hours which is exactly what i wanted
[20159.82s -> 20162.14s]  was it good for you it was good it was great for me i hope it was great for
[20162.14s -> 20172.06s]  you too i will see you guys again on what we're
[20172.06s -> 20181.53s]  doing here right tuesday right tuesday wednesday thursday
[20181.53s -> 20191.82s]  that sounds about right that sounds right to me
[20191.82s -> 20203.99s]  next time on dragon ball z somebody in chat just said that
[20203.99s -> 20214.18s]  let me get this up here sounds good what how long has this been on for
[20214.18s -> 20222.62s]  no not for did i just turn it back on hopefully i don't flake out on sam
[20222.62s -> 20227.08s]  and max no i i won't i i wouldn't have the only reason why it happened is
[20227.08s -> 20230.28s]  because the internet was so bad i just couldn't even stream it
[20230.28s -> 20233.80s]  and i'm not i don't want to power through a game like that that
[20233.80s -> 20239.94s]  requires you know tons of dialogue tons of choices tons of things to pay
[20239.94s -> 20242.34s]  attention to and it you know the internet just drops to
[20242.34s -> 20248.22s]  fucking zero and i'm gonna be honest with you here
[20248.22s -> 20252.22s]  the internet problem is gonna be a potential long-term issue
[20252.30s -> 20259.26s]  for a while because it's just at the point right now with us changing to a
[20259.26s -> 20262.04s]  few things and then doing something we're at
[20262.04s -> 20266.94s]  uh 9,300 drop frames in about six hours
[20266.94s -> 20272.74s]  which is that's not unbearable but it's not good
[20272.74s -> 20276.36s]  we're just barely at that level where it's not
[20276.36s -> 20285.30s]  unwatchable and hopefully i mean what we're hoping is
[20285.30s -> 20289.54s]  that we get through this couple weeks of just terrible internet for some
[20289.54s -> 20294.12s]  reason or they actually do catch one of the
[20294.12s -> 20302.86s]  noise problems or packet problems whatever it is and they get it fixed
[20302.86s -> 20307.21s]  so you know we probably gonna have to just deal with
[20307.21s -> 20316.01s]  one percent two percent potentially drop frames probably for a little while
[20316.01s -> 20318.57s]  lol
[20320.60s -> 20325.72s]  oh that's all those call of duty players no that's all good
