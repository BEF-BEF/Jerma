[0.06s -> 8.26s]  Hold on. Yeah, I got a rug pulled underneath me trying to get The Sims 2 to work.
[8.26s -> 11.62s]  I was at it for like three hours. I tried it last night. Everything seemed to be fine.
[13.54s -> 29.13s]  Oh well. So I had to freak out and get The Sims 3 very, very quickly. Apparently to get The Sims 2
[29.13s -> 39.80s]  to run, you have to go through an entire syllabus of classwork. But we're here now.
[41.74s -> 44.70s]  Uh, let me just open up The Sims 3. Hope everything's doing all right.
[45.50s -> 49.29s]  Yeah, this was, this was a panic get The Sims 3. I'll be honest with you.
[49.85s -> 54.98s]  I got to the splash screen in Sims 2. Things are working. All right, cool. I'm at the menu.
[54.98s -> 58.34s]  And I've tried to trust me. It's been a while. I've tried to get it to work.
[59.06s -> 63.06s]  Um, but then when it, when, you know, you figure it works, you're like, I'm ready.
[63.06s -> 66.42s]  And then you click buttons and the game doesn't, it turns off on you.
[66.42s -> 77.00s]  So we had to panic and freak out at like 358 and just, uh, what do I do? Get The Sims 3.
[77.00s -> 80.92s]  I don't even know. Just get The Sims 3 and install it. So we're going to play The Sims 3.
[83.16s -> 89.67s]  Very unprofessional. Yeah, I know. Welcome. Welcome. I am very unprofessional. It's,
[90.63s -> 100.23s]  it's all I do is unprofessional. Anyways, hope everyone's doing well. I'm doing okay.
[100.87s -> 104.82s]  I'm doing good. I'm very excited for today's stream.
[105.62s -> 114.84s]  Very excited. Bugleberry OnlyFans. Nope. That is not, uh, that is not the announcement.
[121.13s -> 130.84s]  Sims Omega Lul. What's wrong with Sims? Am I healthy? No, but that's okay.
[131.72s -> 138.33s]  I, I'm, I'm getting there. I am incredibly excited for the, uh, for the month of August.
[140.90s -> 147.86s]  And here comes the announcement. Later on, soon, because I'm going to milk the fuck out of this
[147.86s -> 153.06s]  until you can't stand it anymore. And then I'm forced to tell you in like an hour and a half.
[158.31s -> 167.50s]  I'm not going to wait that long. Tell us now. No, it's not a t-shirt. Do you think I would be
[167.50s -> 173.02s]  hyping up this stream for the last like three or four weeks? Tell you that there's a new t-shirt
[173.02s -> 186.26s]  on the store. No, a big announcement. I've got a new Glooman shirt. This time, instead of it being
[186.26s -> 198.30s]  a Navy background, it's green. I would hope that like 5,000 of you would unsub. Give us a riddle?
[199.45s -> 205.56s]  Sure. I'll give you a riddle. Well, hold on. I gotta wait for people to trickle in. You get,
[205.56s -> 210.79s]  I can't just turn the stream on and be like, ladies and gentlemen, it's not Grotto Beasts.
[210.79s -> 216.87s]  That's something, that's different. That's, that's something else coming. All right. Let's,
[216.87s -> 222.01s]  let's, what do you say we make a character in the Sims? Right. I have like the, some of the
[222.01s -> 225.05s]  expansions. I have like the nightlife. I just bought, look, I freaked out and I bought the
[225.05s -> 230.87s]  first thing I could find. You know what I mean? I freaked the fuck out and I bought the first
[230.87s -> 246.89s]  thing that was available. Can you see it? There we are. How's my back? It's okay. It could be,
[246.89s -> 254.76s]  it could be better. Wait, you dumbass. Oh shit. What does it say? Sims 3. Let's start a family.
[256.89s -> 265.02s]  That's an old YouTube video title if I've ever seen one. Yep. That's a YouTube title. Oh well,
[265.02s -> 273.00s]  it's going up. I wanted to play the Sims 2. It's doing so bad. I'll try to get it to work
[273.00s -> 284.60s]  another time. I just freaked out. Okay. So, um, here's the Sims 3. Let's make, let's go create
[284.60s -> 298.82s]  Sims. I think I'm gonna make me, I think. Okay. If I remember the Sims 3, uh, visit the Sims 3
[298.82s -> 304.78s]  store via shop mode. Leave me alone. Welcome to create a Sim. I know how to make a Sim.
[306.57s -> 321.75s]  Didn't I sing a fucking song for this? I feel like a grandpa video. Yeah, I did. This is a
[321.75s -> 331.42s]  grandpa video. Let me just, hold on a minute. Grandpa plays the Sims 3. I did play this.
[332.38s -> 370.07s]  Grandpa plays the Sims 3. I was like, why am I hearing this memory? My brain. All right,
[370.07s -> 381.69s]  how about we do it? You copied Markiplier? That's Peter Griffin. That's Peter Griffin.
[381.77s -> 391.74s]  That's Peter Griffin is playing Sims 3. Oh fuck. All right. All right. All right. All right. Oh,
[391.74s -> 401.22s]  my God. I'm freaking out. We're going to make a Sim. It's going to be me. It's going to be a
[401.22s -> 410.84s]  Jeremy. It'll be a household. My name is Peter. Okay. Can somebody, the family guy fan tell me,
[411.64s -> 417.00s]  has there ever been a time where Peter has gone? My name is Peter. My name is Peter. I'm going to
[417.00s -> 425.86s]  do this. My name is Peter. Has it ever happened? I have been looking for it. Sing the song. No,
[425.86s -> 429.38s]  because everyone just thought it was a family guy routine. And now I'm like self-conscious.
[437.40s -> 445.43s]  God damn it. I'm going to be dreaming about that. I'm going to have nightmares about that. All
[445.43s -> 450.36s]  right. We'll do Jeremy Albertson. That's good. I'll live with a bunch of a couple of weirdos.
[450.36s -> 466.23s]  Don't worry. I've definitely gained a lot of weight. Like the saw house. Let's see. Well,
[466.23s -> 473.94s]  I definitely, my stomach has gone out a lot. The same story actually has a pretty robust creator.
[473.94s -> 482.79s]  I forgot. You are not a young adult. Yes, I am. Would you classify as not what I mean? No,
[483.43s -> 497.78s]  I'm not anymore. You're an elder. I'm just a regular adult. Yep. So 35. Oh shit.
[499.06s -> 503.24s]  I think you're right. Yeah. I think you're right. All right. That looks good.
[506.18s -> 515.30s]  Faces. Let's go to the face. Can I? Oh yeah. Advanced. Let's do
[516.26s -> 523.34s]  the eyes. Advanced. This doesn't even need to be accurate. I don't. What do I care about?
[523.34s -> 530.20s]  You forgot how old you were. No, I just think I feel like a young adult still. No, I don't.
[531.00s -> 538.18s]  I have a shitload of health problems. Like I remember how I felt when I was 30. I don't
[538.18s -> 545.05s]  feel like that right now. You know what I'm saying? What was the big announcement? Well,
[546.17s -> 560.97s]  interesting. Interesting. What if I just didn't even have an announcement? This is just a way
[560.97s -> 569.05s]  to get as many people here as I could. This is not even me, by the way. This doesn't look
[569.05s -> 584.74s]  anything like me. You ever have a dream of somebody that you know and they look like
[584.74s -> 591.24s]  this in your dream and they don't look anything like that? I swear to God, I dream about this
[591.24s -> 598.52s]  person all the time and they're supposed to be my dad. This exact person shows up as my father,
[598.52s -> 604.49s]  as a friend, as a colleague. I don't know why it's just this face happens all the time.
[605.13s -> 614.92s]  Have you dreamed of this man? Yes, all the time. I kind of have a wide mouth.
[622.98s -> 633.32s]  Grill master. I don't, it doesn't have to be me. You know what? This looks like, this looks like
[633.32s -> 641.46s]  when Disney finally makes the Pinocchio IRL remake. Don't you feel like this is like the IRL live
[641.46s -> 653.22s]  action Pinocchio? They'll make him like a, just a guy that lives in like a flat in Pennsylvania.
[653.94s -> 661.56s]  Wait, they don't change the story in the live action remakes. What am I talking about?
[665.83s -> 669.67s]  Why would they just remake it and have him be a guy that lives in like New York City or something?
[669.67s -> 678.44s]  That's all right. Should I just mod the fuck out of this game too?
[678.44s -> 685.45s]  Then we're gonna play this a couple times. I'm gonna play this today and then, well hey,
[686.57s -> 694.66s]  I've got an announcement to make. Ladies and gentlemen, I will be playing The Sims 3
[695.46s -> 704.18s]  again next week. Probably Tuesday or Monday of next week. Quite an announcement. Also,
[704.18s -> 711.08s]  I've got another announcement to make. Announcement part two is I believe the
[711.08s -> 718.58s]  battleship tournament finals will be this week as well in a few days. I think we're trying to do it
[718.58s -> 731.82s]  on Thursday. Huge fucking announcement. What do you think about that? No tattoos. Is that the
[731.82s -> 737.32s]  announcement? If you think that's the announcement, then I don't know what to tell you. Okay,
[737.32s -> 747.40s]  this is fine. Let's do hair. Sim points on sale. Sale ends at 6am. Why would a sale end at 6am?
[748.12s -> 769.08s]  With this in-game currency stuff? Okay. I love picking outfits and hats and stuff. It's really
[769.08s -> 790.31s]  fun. Lies just come so naturally to your forked tongue. Why am I a serpent? Lies come so naturally
[790.31s -> 795.19s]  to your forked tongue. It's definitely this one, but it's not though. It's longer than that.
[801.85s -> 831.58s]  Should I have OC hair? VR hair? It kind of is VR hair. Yeah, we'll keep it for now. I gotta
[831.58s -> 844.07s]  get these glasses off. I don't have any body hair. Not like it matters. It's a second life hair.
[844.63s -> 854.76s]  No, let me take... I gotta fix the face. How do I get this shit off? Clothing. All right, head.
[860.46s -> 869.27s]  Where's the... Does this look anything like me? Is it looks? Hair? Body hair? Facial hair? Eyebrows?
[869.27s -> 874.26s]  Hair? How do I get the glasses off? Clothing, right? How come there's... Oh, here we go. Here
[874.26s -> 889.00s]  we go. Accessories. Get this off. Fix the eyebrows. I'm begging you. I will in a minute. Let's just
[889.00s -> 896.14s]  take it off. All right, I'm changing the name. I want to keep this person, but they're not going
[896.14s -> 921.35s]  to be me. It'd be like VR Elberton? Young Bugleberry? Make him Bugleberry? All right,
[921.35s -> 928.50s]  this would just be Young Bugleberry. That's actually a good idea. What's his name? Barry
[929.06s -> 933.50s]  Fernard? What's his name? I forget. He told me it once. I don't remember it though.
[934.30s -> 950.01s]  Yeah, Barry Fernard. Yeah, Bugleberry. Something like that. Yeah, I'm going to keep it as Elberton
[950.01s -> 961.05s]  though. I actually like that. I am so excited. I'm like trying so hard to keep it together
[961.85s -> 967.93s]  because you have no idea how excited I am. And you should be too because
[969.61s -> 980.25s]  this needs your brother. It could be. I think a trench coat? I mean, that's kind of close.
[981.05s -> 987.53s]  Needs to be fatter though. I just keep thinking about Grandpa. It's just Peter Griffin singing
[987.53s -> 998.84s]  about how he's going to play the game. Never to save often because the game is prone to crashing.
[998.84s -> 1010.15s]  That's a good point. I will. That looks good. Clothing. What about pants? This is formal,
[1010.15s -> 1020.84s]  but I kind of want this every day. All right, every day. Get these glasses off. I don't want
[1020.84s -> 1034.23s]  these glasses. What is happening? Well, he did have one of those Hawaiian shirts on. It's milking
[1034.23s -> 1051.58s]  us. All right. You want to start dropping some hints for you? You want a hint? Some of that we
[1051.58s -> 1061.29s]  talked about like three years ago, like at least probably three plus years ago, we had a conversation,
[1061.29s -> 1068.47s]  a very specific conversation about this. This has been something that's been on the brain for
[1069.19s -> 1085.62s]  a very long time. I like that. It is not baseball. I just love doing this. So fun just to
[1087.14s -> 1095.46s]  create a character here and decide how I'd like them to look and put them into a place of residence.
[1096.42s -> 1105.62s]  God, it's so much fun to do that. All right, that looks good. No, nobody's pregnant. What are you
[1105.62s -> 1111.99s]  talking about? I'm not pregnant. What? All right, let's get some traits. He's definitely
[1112.79s -> 1130.49s]  commitment issues, coward. No. Is Bugleberry evil? Not really. He has demonic powers, but I don't
[1130.49s -> 1144.09s]  think he's evil. He's a genius for sure. Well, this is young Bugleberry, right? This is before
[1144.09s -> 1150.33s]  Bugleberry drank the weird potion that made him Bugleberry. He's a student at MIT, right? Or
[1150.33s -> 1167.27s]  whatever it is. Let's do, he's definitely brave, charismatic, very charismatic. I'm going to put
[1167.27s -> 1182.01s]  friendly. Not inappropriate. Party animal. Are you running for office? I'm not running for office.
[1182.89s -> 1190.68s]  What was that? Did you hear that? It was like a Beavis and Butthead just laughed. It just came
[1190.68s -> 1209.86s]  up for no reason. He's good. Okay, we have genius, brave, charismatic. We need like a bookworm,
[1209.86s -> 1220.36s]  probably. Yeah, that's good. Lifetime wish is to be a world-renowned surgeon. That makes sense.
[1221.00s -> 1238.04s]  International super spy. No. Chess legend. Leader of the free world. A master mixologist.
[1238.84s -> 1248.52s]  All right, get rid of this one. Oh wait, that means booze. That does not mean what I think it is.
[1248.52s -> 1262.18s]  Yeah, I like mixologist. That's fine. Own a bar. Same thing. Oh, a forensic specialist,
[1262.18s -> 1269.94s]  dynamic DNA profiler. Well, now we know where that comes from. Tell us, you rat fan.
[1270.74s -> 1277.11s]  Just wait a minute. Just wait a minute. Just wait till we get out of the character creator.
[1277.11s -> 1283.83s]  Oh, I'm so excited. I'm so excited. You have no idea. I'm holding it in because I look,
[1283.83s -> 1289.51s]  this has been going on for like years and it's finally happening. Finally. And it's real and
[1289.51s -> 1296.23s]  has a real date and it's going to be fucking crazy. Okay. I'm driving everybody crazy,
[1296.23s -> 1305.03s]  but it's okay. That looks good. Favorites. He loves, what is he like? What would Bugleberry be?
[1305.03s -> 1309.77s]  I can't even say his name. Tell us now. Crack, crack, crack, crack. Just wait, wait, wait,
[1309.77s -> 1324.42s]  wait. Just stop smoking crack for a second. He'd probably eat this. That's pretty Bugleberry-esque.
[1325.94s -> 1335.93s]  What is Bugleberry? Gemini? Capricorn? Libra? Cancer? Aries? It's not Germacon. It's not.
[1336.89s -> 1340.89s]  We'll talk a lot about it. And guys, the whole point of this stream is essentially
[1341.69s -> 1345.61s]  to get everybody excited and to get me excited because I haven't talked about it at all.
[1346.41s -> 1357.29s]  Wait, I'm waiting. I'm milking it. It's having to be a Pisces or whatever. I need to get rid of
[1357.29s -> 1375.35s]  those glasses though. He's mega milking it. Sure. You could say that. All right. Bugleberry,
[1375.35s -> 1384.02s]  I think is ready. Bernard Bugleberry is good to go. And then one other person. I don't like
[1384.02s -> 1390.63s]  managing more than two people in the sim. That's hell. That's good. Okay. Add a sim.
[1394.20s -> 1408.98s]  Me? All right. Yeah. I'm going young adult. Whatever. I'm young. I can't be fatter than
[1408.98s -> 1423.59s]  Bugleberry though. That's important. But Bernard? Yeah. It's Barry, Bernard, Bugleberry. I think.
[1424.15s -> 1436.39s]  It's pretty messy. How about this one? That one's actually more accurate. That one really is pretty
[1436.39s -> 1457.78s]  accurate. It's the Hillary Clinton hair. It's pretty accurate. How come I can't just make it
[1457.78s -> 1470.90s]  match the color? Yeah. What do my eyebrows look like? Anime hair. Yeah. It's OC hair.
[1470.90s -> 1484.50s]  It's original character hair. All right. That looks fine. Maybe not. Eyebrows aren't that thick.
[1496.65s -> 1506.52s]  I don't like that. Sideburns though. Good. Is the face cam on? I need to grab a glass of water.
[1506.52s -> 1509.80s]  Wait for me to do the announcement. 50 community subs. What are you doing?
[1510.94s -> 1519.80s]  Mystic Quest just gave 50 subs. Out of your mind. That's too much money. Thank you though.
[1519.80s -> 1534.82s]  Appreciate it. That's insane. Let's get me in here. How about my jaw is a little wide.
[1534.82s -> 1540.50s]  I have a really thin chin, but I have a wide jaw. You know what I mean? That makes sense, doesn't it?
[1541.06s -> 1560.30s]  This calls for a face cam? No, it doesn't. I almost had a game a way out. I played it with
[1560.30s -> 1579.94s]  italics. I'm making that guy. I don't want that guy to be in here. I'm just making that character.
[1579.94s -> 1586.74s]  Oh, I am excited today. Do you understand? Okay. I always put my hand through my monitor at 355.
[1587.38s -> 1603.86s]  Actually, no. My nose is bigger than that. Not that long. Yeah, because this institute didn't
[1603.86s -> 1608.50s]  work and I was like, what the fuck am I going to do about this? You want another hint? Okay.
[1612.18s -> 1614.74s]  Another hint. I don't want to give the whole thing away until I have to.
[1621.88s -> 1638.23s]  Purchasing. Purchasing. Buying. Purchasing. There you go. I don't like the way the chin looks.
[1638.23s -> 1668.07s]  I'm pretty smiley. Where's that chin? Details, eyes, head, and ears. Where's my jaw?
[1669.03s -> 1695.70s]  Here we go. Is it a germacoin? No, it's not a germacoin. I'm okay with this. This looks
[1695.70s -> 1699.86s]  way better than I actually do, but who cares? I made myself fat though. I got a little bigger.
[1706.33s -> 1709.53s]  Every day. This actually kind of is already accurate. I don't think I need to change this.
[1710.25s -> 1730.70s]  It looks nothing like you. It looks kind of like me. That looks sort of like me. I really like
[1730.70s -> 1745.51s]  doing this though. It's nothing like you. Well, then I'm going to change his name to like Rad
[1745.51s -> 1766.97s]  Elbertson. I'll change his name to Rad right now. His name is Rad. There. It's fixed. He's
[1767.45s -> 1771.53s]  Rad. Rad Elbertson and Young Bugleberry are going to share like a fucking house together.
[1791.19s -> 1794.55s]  Let's get the, uh, yeah, we'll change his name to Rad Elbertson.
[1804.42s -> 1815.82s]  Those shoes are going to go. Bugleberry's first creation, Rad Elbertson.
[1818.54s -> 1822.31s]  For a second I thought that just said fermented Elbertson. I was like, who the fuck is that?
[1824.44s -> 1831.62s]  All right. Rad and Fernard are going to have a house together. Brown shoes and black pants. You
[1831.62s -> 1840.82s]  can pull it off if you can do it smart enough. I think we're ready to move into a house. We're
[1840.82s -> 1861.54s]  going to build our own. Rad can pull anything off. It's an announcement time. Oh, it's getting real
[1861.54s -> 1867.62s]  close. I'll tell you, it's getting real close. All right. Rad, uh, this is going to be a random
[1868.34s -> 1887.27s]  and he wants to be a aquarium. That's a gigantic laptop. Holy shit. That looks good. He loves
[1887.27s -> 1903.13s]  fishing. All right. Edit relationships. They're brothers. No, no, no, no, no. They're just
[1903.13s -> 1912.55s]  housemates because Bugleberry would have made him. All right, let's go. I don't need a place to live.
[1913.11s -> 1924.70s]  I want to build my own place. Can I do that? Is there a spot here where I can build?
[1925.26s -> 1939.02s]  Here's a place to live. I want to move into a lot. Game is too dark. Why is it dark? That's weird.
[1939.82s -> 1951.82s]  Can I afford any of these lots? It is. Yeah. Why is it dark? Hold on. What's going on here?
[1951.82s -> 1975.62s]  Why is it so dark? What's going on here? Yeah, it's very dark. I would say this is exceptionally dark.
[1977.06s -> 1992.31s]  If I do this, can I make it better? If it's worse, I'll change it. Hold on.
[1992.31s -> 1998.17s]  Okay. If that, if it looks weird, let me know. I'll go back and change it again.
[2002.04s -> 2011.03s]  All right. I need a lot to move these guys into. Can I not do it at this, um,
[2011.03s -> 2019.24s]  she was in the library. Yeah. I want to select the Albertson family and then I want to build my own.
[2019.88s -> 2035.93s]  You can't start with a lot. Why not? How much is this place? Yeah, you can. Yeah. So are there any
[2035.93s -> 2043.80s]  lots available? They just know a lot's available in this expansion. Tell us the announcement.
[2043.80s -> 2050.97s]  I mean, hold on. We'll get it within 15 minutes. Promise. I have to go out of the city. All right.
[2050.97s -> 2064.78s]  Let's go out of the city. The towns. Yeah. I don't want to get me out of the tutorial. I'm good.
[2070.97s -> 2093.13s]  Oh, all right. Here we go. Lot. Got it. Lot. Can I buy it? All right. Go ahead and start.
[2093.93s -> 2104.63s]  Change the lot type. This is the best town in the game. Is it? That's a park. It's not, this is,
[2104.63s -> 2113.99s]  it's a house. Wait, I have to go back. I can change the lot type to a house. Change the lot type. I
[2113.99s -> 2123.24s]  want this to be residential. Okay. Here's a new. All right. Nice. I'm ready. Let's move in. I'm
[2123.24s -> 2135.54s]  going to build a house. It's a coffee. You know what? Okay. I'm ready to move place back into town.
[2136.10s -> 2148.02s]  Return. Oh, the game setup. I see. All right. Within household. Here we go. All right. Let's get it.
[2150.25s -> 2160.10s]  They own this lot. The Elbertson family is going to move it. All right. Who do I want to do? What
[2160.10s -> 2169.35s]  do I want? I need to build. That's fine. Okay. Let's, uh, I got to get the hot keys down here.
[2170.31s -> 2189.64s]  So, uh, we'll start with the walls over here. Let's do this. Make this, uh, uh, how much money do I
[2189.64s -> 2208.95s]  have? 16,000. Is this your parents reveal? I just need one square. And then I kind of want
[2209.75s -> 2227.66s]  go this way. We need this. Oh my fucking God. What are you doing? You start very small in the
[2227.66s -> 2235.58s]  Sims. Don't you understand? Um, they just need a little space. They don't need anything crazy.
[2236.46s -> 2250.01s]  What the fuck is this music? What does the Sims? This is the Sims. I'm playing a game. I'm creating
[2250.01s -> 2255.53s]  a place. I'm moving in. I'm going to be purchasing things. I'm going to be making a nice house for
[2255.53s -> 2269.88s]  myself. Imagine this was real. You imagine controlling somebody in what I would call a
[2269.88s -> 2276.82s]  dollhouse directly controlling a person and they're all their moves and all their things.
[2278.97s -> 2286.97s]  Can you imagine how interesting that would be if you, in fact, were in control of, let's just say,
[2286.97s -> 2301.27s]  me for the sake of argument. Ladies and gentlemen, wouldn't it be interesting if we did the dollhouse
[2301.27s -> 2308.38s]  stream? The thing that I have talked about over and over again for three gosh darn years,
[2310.52s -> 2316.71s]  we're doing the IRL dollhouse stream. You will have direct control over pretty much everything
[2316.71s -> 2324.87s]  I do. There is a lot of moving parts here. We have a lot of partners. We have a lot of people.
[2324.87s -> 2333.94s]  It's going to be the biggest project I've ever done. I hope everybody is prepared for that.
[2335.67s -> 2344.25s]  Here are your days. This is not just one day. This is not just one stream. This is three streams,
[2345.94s -> 2357.50s]  August 18th, August 20th, and August 21st. The first two streams will be at 3 p.m. Eastern,
[2357.50s -> 2366.76s]  and the final stream will be on at 12 p.m. Eastern. We have partnered with Twitch.
[2368.58s -> 2374.68s]  Twitch has ponied up a significant amount of money and funds and help and financing.
[2376.49s -> 2383.94s]  Also partnering up with Kriken and his Ghost Commander Company to actually make the extension.
[2385.94s -> 2398.71s]  It's going to be insane, and that's happening in two weeks. You see, I held it. I held it until I
[2398.71s -> 2409.19s]  get you a hard date. Continue. There will also be, whoa, whoa, whoa, is that it? That's not it?
[2409.91s -> 2415.91s]  There's also going to be other special guests, which I'm sure you may hear about soon.
[2419.72s -> 2427.08s]  The sky is the limit on these streams. There's a lot of really, really interesting things that
[2427.08s -> 2437.62s]  are going to happen, I hope. I am so excited for it. I've been keeping my mouth shut about this
[2438.42s -> 2449.22s]  for five to six months straight. I have wanted to talk about it so much. You have no idea how badly
[2449.22s -> 2470.49s]  I've wanted to do that. But yes, the actual Dollhouse stream is on. There will be no Bionicle.
[2474.39s -> 2482.23s]  No, why? That's not, all right, let me keep going. If you want a little bit of context on this.
[2483.94s -> 2492.76s]  So I think it was actually, I think it was an offline chat one day where we were talking about
[2492.76s -> 2500.87s]  this. And let me just be very, very clear about something. This is not, this is not just going to
[2500.87s -> 2506.15s]  be some little basic stream where, oh yeah, I guess like he's just going to kind of do that.
[2506.15s -> 2514.23s]  Like we'll like control it. You have no idea. This is, so I've talked about the Carnival in the past
[2514.23s -> 2516.79s]  and how a lot that, how much time that took and how much work that took.
[2517.91s -> 2522.23s]  This is the Carnival probably times 10 with the amount of stuff, the amount of
[2523.03s -> 2526.55s]  monetary financing that went into this, the amount of people, the amount of work.
[2526.55s -> 2533.27s]  It's Carnival times 10. What does purchasing and buying have to do with that? Well,
[2536.38s -> 2546.09s]  think about it. When I say you have control over most aspects, what does that mean? You're,
[2546.73s -> 2565.32s]  think about that. I'm so excited. I'm like at the brim right now. And I knew it was going
[2565.32s -> 2569.83s]  to be hard for me to like actually play because, oh, that's been eating me up for a long time.
[2570.47s -> 2582.92s]  I don't know if people have a ton of questions, which I'm not, trust me, I know. I, I know you
[2582.92s -> 2587.88s]  have a lot of questions. Some of the, a lot of these I can't answer because I want this to be
[2587.88s -> 2593.11s]  very much a surprise. But man, if this were real, can you imagine the possibilities?
[2595.21s -> 2611.34s]  All right, let's continue. Context, context. Can you pee on command? You have to find out.
[2612.55s -> 2619.03s]  You're, you're going to have to find out at some point here. You'll have control over me
[2619.75s -> 2627.21s]  and my actions and we'll see how you do. All right. I need to do, I got it. This is going to
[2627.21s -> 2630.58s]  be like the living area. No, this would be like the, I don't know, it'd be like the kitchen,
[2630.58s -> 2643.18s]  living area. And another thing I wanted to say too, we have, there's so many like partnerships
[2643.18s -> 2652.66s]  and people. We are back working with Andy Mark. So many people are involved with this. It's not
[2652.66s -> 2667.05s]  even funny. Network Andy has done it. I mean, community Jake put a shitload of time into this
[2667.05s -> 2671.61s]  too. So, so many people have been putting time into this. It's, it's, it's been a wild journey.
[2674.87s -> 2686.46s]  All right. I need to do, I don't want like stones in here. Metal? I just want like a nice gray,
[2687.10s -> 2698.28s]  a nice gray like wood or linoleum. Yeah. I can't just do like gray. I want gray. Get out.
[2699.00s -> 2723.69s]  This'll do. One of these. How's that? That's fine. With these hands, I hold the fate of a million
[2723.69s -> 2734.10s]  people. What if we tell you to end the stream? Don't worry. I've got it. It would just,
[2735.22s -> 2742.15s]  if anything, this is going to be one of the most wild experiments we've ever done. Yeah. The scale
[2742.15s -> 2751.99s]  is probably about five plus times the scale of the carnival. How about just like a, do we have
[2751.99s -> 2764.49s]  like a pink, like a tile? This'll be the bathroom. Oh no, maybe like I need like a,
[2764.49s -> 2774.66s]  no, that's too pink. This is a massive bathroom. It is kind of a huge bathroom.
[2774.66s -> 2787.19s]  We've got to give the time zones. August 18th at 3 PM Eastern. August 20th at 3 PM Eastern.
[2788.07s -> 2795.78s]  August 21st at 12 PM Eastern. Here are your dates and times for the three
[2796.58s -> 2810.33s]  dollhouse streams. That's fine. It's too bad. There's a tile, right? Okay. And then I need a,
[2811.05s -> 2833.37s]  let's do the, let's do this from first. I need like paint. Make an outhouse. 12 PM. Wow. Yeah.
[2835.37s -> 2845.03s]  I can answer some questions, but not very many. How do I do? I want to just do paint on the walls.
[2845.03s -> 2853.80s]  How do I do that? Isn't it build mode? Walls, right? Oh, here we go. This is like a kitchen area.
[2853.80s -> 2868.86s]  Let's do like this. It's really fucking ugly. Anything lighter? How's that even uglier?
[2871.42s -> 2881.96s]  That's fine. We have school in August. That's just going to order a computer and have you sit at
[2881.96s -> 2896.73s]  your desk all day. These rooms are enormous. Well, I'm trying.
[2906.63s -> 2913.56s]  Hold shift. All right. That's right. That's right. Maybe. Hold on. Okay. I wasn't listening. When is
[2913.56s -> 2924.52s]  it happening? It's happening. All right. August, August 18th, 20th and 21st. There you are. I can't
[2924.52s -> 2936.98s]  see what you guys do. Okay. Now I need to do, let's get a door on here. Doors. How about
[2938.50s -> 2949.50s]  this is a regular door. Just need a regular door. These external doors.
[2950.06s -> 2968.36s]  That was a regular door. I need a hallway. Why do I need a hallway? I have my first house here.
[2969.91s -> 2983.16s]  What is a Frank proof door? It's just open. Oh shit. I didn't paint that.
[2983.80s -> 2999.48s]  There it is. It looks good. Now we need some appliances. I'm just starting. Did you miss
[2999.48s -> 3014.74s]  the announcement? You may have. Refrigerator. Just a standard fridge. Don't need anything crazy.
[3014.74s -> 3025.43s]  How much do I have? 10,000. That's good. I need a stove. That looks good. I don't need that much.
[3025.43s -> 3030.63s]  We need to get jobs first. How long are the streams going to be? Well, that depends on a few factors.
[3031.19s -> 3044.41s]  That depends on how well you guys do. That depends on a few things. I need a sink too, I think. Yeah.
[3044.41s -> 3062.47s]  Can I just get a white counter? I just want a regular counter. Just a white countertop.
[3063.19s -> 3079.43s]  We need to keep you alive. You'll see. Yes. I am under your control. I am your dollhouse.
[3080.76s -> 3084.04s]  You're going to have to make sure I don't fucking get murdered.
[3084.84s -> 3092.52s]  You're going to have to help me. I can't do it all on my own. That's too much responsibility.
[3097.11s -> 3105.77s]  There's so many questions. I'm so excited. I can't wait. I just want a regular counter. I
[3105.77s -> 3118.01s]  want just a white counter. I don't want to spend sim points. What the fuck are these counters?
[3118.65s -> 3132.34s]  Oh, fucking whatever. It's still really dark up here, isn't it? I need a window.
[3132.82s -> 3149.38s]  I need some windows. We got it on. Nightmare in-game. Yeah. I feel like I'm in the middle of
[3149.38s -> 3162.66s]  Main Street at Disney World. I don't remember this music. The parade just doesn't stop. Okay.
[3168.10s -> 3174.71s]  Oh, what about a carpet? I need a bed too. All right. The bed's going to be over here.
[3175.27s -> 3181.99s]  It's like watching a boomer use a computer for the first time. Oh, yeah? Because boomer's favorite
[3181.99s -> 3195.24s]  game is The Sims. It's probably The Sims 3. It's definitely not The Sims 4. Okay. Let's do a bed.
[3195.24s -> 3198.73s]  I don't need too much stuff. And then they can get in there. I just need a bathroom. I'm almost
[3198.73s -> 3210.68s]  ready. I'm trying to read. I'm trying to respond to as many things as I can. Sims 3 is better than
[3210.68s -> 3219.19s]  4. You know, actually, I probably would agree with that. All right. Bed. We need two beds here,
[3219.19s -> 3228.02s]  at least temporarily, because we're going to have multiple rooms soon. We just have two beds. How
[3228.02s -> 3242.39s]  comfortable are these? Are these not comfortable? Energy 8. Yeah, these are fine. I need one more of
[3242.39s -> 3252.78s]  those. You know what this looks like? This looks like the world's shittiest hotel. This is just you
[3252.78s -> 3267.26s]  walk in. This is a hotel room. But it's a good hotel at the same time. Two twin beds. Okay.
[3268.06s -> 3276.20s]  Now we just need some bathroom stuff. Let's go with some toilets. Oh, I thought that was a toilet.
[3276.20s -> 3289.91s]  Just a regular toilet's fine. This is huge. This bed. These are... It's so big. It's way too big.
[3289.91s -> 3298.38s]  Okay. This is a massive bathroom. This could be a bedroom too. Okay. Well, whatever. It doesn't
[3298.38s -> 3316.58s]  matter. I need a shower. I have it in a different style. I can. Is that gonna... I need a sink.
[3317.22s -> 3330.78s]  This looks good. I need a counter though. Why do I have to pay with sim points? That's stupid. I
[3330.78s -> 3358.92s]  don't like that. I don't like that. Oh, fuck it. Whatever. Just... We're gonna have a party in here.
[3358.92s -> 3363.19s]  They're gonna be waking each other up all the time. I don't think so. All right. We have... Do
[3363.19s -> 3371.19s]  everything we need just to start. I think we can start. Okay. Do we like each other? Do we hate
[3371.19s -> 3381.29s]  each other? Let's see. In the bathtub around? Is it wrong way? That's not the wrong... It was the
[3381.29s -> 3387.06s]  right way. Save the game. Holy shit. You're right. Squeaky clean. This person's really clean. All
[3387.06s -> 3403.62s]  right. Good. I don't have any lights. Save. Why is the bathroom so big? Just because it is.
[3404.34s -> 3412.62s]  It's a public bathroom. Is he stalling still? No, I already talked about it.
[3412.62s -> 3431.93s]  Why is it taking so long to save? That was way too long. All right. Everyone, go in here.
[3432.73s -> 3443.82s]  Check out the new... Check out your place. We'll see the... It's three. Okay. Don't show me this
[3443.82s -> 3466.15s]  ever again. This is Bugleberry's house. Do you like the toilet? Good. Okay. So who wants to get the
[3466.15s -> 3485.27s]  first job? It sounded like fucking early Kyler. Jower? How come they don't share a bed? Because
[3485.27s -> 3492.15s]  we're housemates. We're not like together. There are no lights. I'll add lights. Just give me a
[3492.15s -> 3514.02s]  second. Oh, that's so ugly. Oh, I hate it. Oh, it's the worst. I really don't like it,
[3514.02s -> 3528.57s]  but I'm going to keep it. Okay. We need a light switch, right? Hey, you know a motel? Yes.
[3529.37s -> 3537.75s]  Expand it by 500% and just have all this extra space and then put that into a house, please.
[3538.31s -> 3552.65s]  These are the worst lights ever? They're fine. Where's the light switch? 500 times more space.
[3552.65s -> 3565.88s]  Oh, we need toilet paper. All right. Should I be evil and have it be behind?
[3567.85s -> 3575.78s]  By the way, the toilet paper needs to be close enough to the toilet where it's reachable,
[3576.82s -> 3582.66s]  but not far away enough where you have to reach behind you. I've seen this before and I know. Fuck
[3582.66s -> 3590.86s]  that. If the toilet's too close to the paper, you do the weird thing where you're unrolling the paper
[3591.66s -> 3594.70s]  and it kind of like starts touching your legs and stuff. I don't like it.
[3595.66s -> 3607.06s]  Reaching behind you to get toilet paper is awful. Table, roof, ceiling, lights. I'm working on it.
[3607.86s -> 3633.61s]  What about your Instagram? I don't have an Instagram. Did Ludwig ever give you the bidet? No.
[3639.05s -> 3643.83s]  I need to refer back to a tweet I made. I think I made this tweet like eight years ago.
[3645.88s -> 3652.04s]  I only have like one or two pieces of social media. It's my Twitter and here and like YouTube.
[3652.92s -> 3656.94s]  Don't refer to the tweet I made like seven years ago about accounts that I don't have,
[3656.94s -> 3660.38s]  that I don't own, that were just made. I don't know what they are.
[3661.66s -> 3674.70s]  That was three. Have you forgotten about Discord? All right, let's keep going.
[3675.34s -> 3684.07s]  Can I do a bidet recommendation? Ludwig, I think, is going to give me a good one.
[3685.46s -> 3689.14s]  He has an exact one that he was going to do. He knows exactly which one to give me. That's what
[3689.14s -> 3697.38s]  he said. What was that radish tweet? I like radishes. I don't know. It just made me laugh
[3697.38s -> 3702.76s]  that I have that many on the plate. People were really concerned about that tweet, by the way.
[3704.23s -> 3710.87s]  Dude, what the fuck? You don't eat this, right? Yeah, I did. I ate all of that. It was good.
[3710.87s -> 3718.14s]  I like radishes and I like sandwiches. It just like looked really sad. I don't know. It was a
[3718.14s -> 3725.37s]  way to like, uh, that's like what you're, that's like what you send to your mother to prove that
[3725.37s -> 3729.53s]  you're eating. You know, like, oh, you're at college, honey. Well, how are you doing?
[3730.33s -> 3745.98s]  Ma, look, I got, I'm fine. Okay. Are you eating? Yes, I'm eating. Let's keep going. I want to do,
[3745.98s -> 3752.41s]  uh, health store actually. Oh yeah, lights. Everyone was mad about lights.
[3757.24s -> 3763.27s]  Ceiling lights. Let's be against a wall. I don't think I can, oh, no, no, no, roof. Somebody
[3763.27s -> 3777.24s]  should put a roof on. Roof, roof, roof, roof, roof. Here, look. I feel like this is what Pee-wee's
[3777.24s -> 3793.48s]  playhouse looks out, like from the outside. How about just, just sand. Thank goodness. I got a
[3793.48s -> 3804.39s]  fairy tale character lives in here. All right. That's fine. I don't need it. Okay. The roof is
[3804.39s -> 3821.27s]  done. All right. Get this off. How do I get the roof off? Walls down, walls cut away, right?
[3822.07s -> 3831.32s]  Okay. Here we go. Is this your first Minecraft house? Kind of is. What is going on here? How do
[3831.32s -> 3842.95s]  I get out of this? How come the walls aren't cutting away? Down, cut away, up. Walls up,
[3843.03s -> 3857.24s]  walls down, walls cut away. Do page down. Oh shit. Wait, what? Oh, I see what you mean. Okay.
[3859.77s -> 3864.98s]  All right. That's a Will Ferrell elf music. These, they've been just talking out here for like,
[3864.98s -> 3881.77s]  it's fucking four hours. All right. Where is, all right. Somebody go, where, where's their thing
[3881.77s -> 3889.27s]  that says how good they're doing? Here it is. All right. Fun. We need some fun stuff. Outdoors.
[3890.30s -> 3900.07s]  You go buy a car? What? Sloppy jalopy? I kind of want to, I want a car. I want a sloppy jalopy.
[3900.07s -> 3914.15s]  All right. How about a TV? Yeah, that makes sense. Doesn't it? Sort by function,
[3914.95s -> 3923.67s]  appliances, entertainment, treadmill. You know, I, can I just like sort stuff by alphabetically?
[3924.23s -> 3928.95s]  I don't like having like 40 tabs open. Like I just, there's like five different,
[3928.95s -> 3935.59s]  10 different subcategories. I just want like a list of stuff. Bathroom, bedroom, living room.
[3936.15s -> 3958.98s]  You're gonna have to have a cheap TV, a little couch. That's fine. Big motel.
[3962.02s -> 3964.90s]  How do you like that? Let's move. Oh, get the paper.
[3969.74s -> 3983.62s]  Uh, let's find a job. Within bedroom walls? Like a divider. All right. Read it.
[3984.02s -> 3991.99s]  Available jobs. Rad Elbertson, I think should be doing, I mean, that's perfect. 25 bucks an hour.
[3992.55s -> 4003.70s]  They look like coffins. They do look like coffins. Also something else that I want to make sure I
[4003.70s -> 4011.61s]  make very clear to everybody. Um, so because, so Twitch, this is another part of the, kind of the
[4011.61s -> 4017.53s]  whole stream going on. Um, so Twitch is giving us a significant amount of money to do this stream
[4017.53s -> 4022.57s]  coming up here in a couple of weeks. And one of the things that were kind of our agreement with
[4022.57s -> 4029.72s]  them was we were going to run ads. Uh, so they're going to be ads on those streams and in pretty
[4029.72s -> 4036.94s]  much until the stream happens. So what we're going to do, I'm going to try to do this in as
[4037.98s -> 4044.82s]  non-egregious way as I possibly can. So what we're probably going to end up doing is on BRBs for the
[4044.82s -> 4050.10s]  next, uh, it's not going to happen on the next stream, but it'll happen this stream. Uh, we'll
[4050.10s -> 4058.66s]  probably do a couple minutes of ads, two or three minutes of ads. So that's part of per our agreement
[4058.66s -> 4066.79s]  with Twitch and they have, I will tell you that's for, for the amount of money and the amount of
[4066.79s -> 4075.38s]  help that Twitch has given us for this. It's a, it's, it's worth doing. It is. So, uh, I want to
[4076.25s -> 4084.71s]  see if I can test to see if it works. So we're going to test it right now because if I can't get
[4084.71s -> 4092.60s]  it to work, uh, I'm going to be a little concerned, but let me make sure we are going to do
[4093.24s -> 4098.89s]  right now. I'm going to go pee. I actually haven't peed in like three hours. So we're going to run
[4098.89s -> 4103.69s]  two minutes of ads right, right now. And hopefully it works because this is a good place to test it
[4103.69s -> 4110.82s]  because we need, I need to make sure this actually is going to work for the actual days. Let's do,
[4110.82s -> 4115.93s]  let's give it a check. That's right. I'll be right back. I'm going to go pee. I'm going to get
[4115.93s -> 4122.89s]  another probably coffee or so, and we'll try it out. Let me know if you don't apologize. Well,
[4122.89s -> 4129.24s]  I want to try, I want you guys to have a good experience and everybody else does too. So I'm
[4129.24s -> 4135.59s]  going to try to do this the best way I can. I'll be right back in five minutes. We'll try two
[4135.59s -> 4327.75s]  minutes and see how it goes. Okay. Hello. Uh, so how'd it go? Didn't anybody see them? Did you guys
[4327.75s -> 4338.06s]  see the ads? It's up. Did people see them? I want to make sure it works. Depends. Okay. I got two.
[4338.06s -> 4344.30s]  Okay. Uh, and I want to just take a second. I know this stream has been a lot. This has not
[4344.30s -> 4348.70s]  necessarily been a like sim stream as much as it had been. Hey, here's what's happening. I want
[4348.70s -> 4354.71s]  to give you guys enough notice. But this is very important. Um, I am not going to make any money
[4354.71s -> 4361.74s]  from this, this event at all. I will not, I'm not going to be able to take a cent from any of this.
[4361.74s -> 4369.42s]  All of this is going to go towards production. Make sure people are being paid. I'm not taking
[4369.42s -> 4374.54s]  a dollar from this because I can't, because that's how we have a good show. Um, so if you're
[4374.54s -> 4383.11s]  wondering, which has given us a significant amount of money, but all of it and then some, uh,
[4383.11s -> 4390.41s]  is going to be spent solely on the show. Um, I want people to know that. So if people maybe
[4390.41s -> 4394.49s]  think that like, Oh man, what's this fucking deal? He's got how many people? He's probably
[4394.49s -> 4400.44s]  making bank. No, I am not. If this is to make sure that we have enough money to be able to do the
[4400.44s -> 4406.97s]  show, I'm not going to be taking any money. It will be probably impossible. Uh, if you have no
[4406.97s -> 4411.42s]  context, I'll give you a little bit of context. We're doing a dollhouse. Well, you will control
[4411.42s -> 4419.59s]  me for three streams. We have an amazing extension team. This is not going to just be a click map
[4419.59s -> 4433.13s]  guys. This is a custom built extension created for this stream. Running ads is something that I have,
[4433.13s -> 4438.86s]  you know, I'm trying to do my best with it, right? Um, and just to let everybody know it's,
[4438.94s -> 4447.69s]  this is only for this broadcast stuff. Um, I'm not planning on running ads on it in a permanent
[4447.69s -> 4456.22s]  setting, but just so you know, I'm not going to see anything from this. Well, I am going to see
[4456.22s -> 4462.39s]  something from this. You know what I'm going to see from this? I'm going to see an insanely fun
[4462.39s -> 4469.13s]  experiment. I'm going to see a bunch of people put together something that hopefully is crazy to
[4469.13s -> 4483.08s]  experience. Um, so I want to make that clear. You can, Oh man, he's probably making bank.
[4485.06s -> 4492.12s]  No. Um, and I'm incredibly excited. I'm very nervous is probably not the right word because
[4492.12s -> 4495.16s]  I'm just kind of bottled up. I've been trying to, I've been holding onto this for a long time.
[4495.16s -> 4501.90s]  There's been so much work, but I'm very, very excited. I hope it's as fun as I think it's
[4501.90s -> 4512.41s]  going to be August 18th, August 20th, August 21st. Give us some more ads. You will. You'll
[4512.41s -> 4517.43s]  probably get them every 45 minutes to an hour or so. Maybe I think is when we're probably going to
[4517.43s -> 4528.42s]  try to run them. Wanted to make that clear. Let's continue to just chill and hang out.
[4528.42s -> 4539.86s]  I will answer some more questions if you'd like to hear about them and let's go back to the game.
[4539.86s -> 4549.19s]  Hope you become a billionaire. I, I don't want to become a billionaire. No, thank you.
[4549.19s -> 4552.55s]  That sounds, that's, I don't want it. I don't want that just too much. That's too much.
[4555.86s -> 4564.42s]  All right. Uh, uh, rad should take that Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[4565.06s -> 4571.56s]  25 bucks an hour to start. Holy shit. All right. Yeah, let's do it. All right. What about, uh,
[4571.56s -> 4577.72s]  what about, uh, bugleberry? Wait, did I put like a little divider here?
[4578.36s -> 4589.86s]  For me, you owe me money after you crashed the jet pack. Am I paying for your jet pack?
[4593.11s -> 4597.82s]  Why don't ever let me use a jet pack. What are you talking about? Pay him back. I don't even,
[4597.82s -> 4611.77s]  I didn't break anybody's jet pack. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. We need a divider here. Is this going to
[4611.77s -> 4635.32s]  work? No, that's not going to work. I guess it may be, it kind of will. Oh, that's a very,
[4635.32s -> 4650.84s]  that's ugly. That's very ugly. I don't want that. A little smaller. How about a prank proof door?
[4651.88s -> 4666.42s]  Okay. That's fine. There you go. Now you have some privacy. So go to bed if you want to go to bed.
[4666.42s -> 4672.34s]  Stop. Why are you in bed anyways? What are you? It's like, what time is it?
[4675.45s -> 4680.49s]  Share this memory. Cars cannot be placed in a lot with no parking spaces. Buy a parking space.
[4681.13s -> 4694.46s]  Oh shit. Okay. I want a parking space. I want a car parking space. Our spot parking space. Oh,
[4694.46s -> 4704.25s]  okay. Cool. How about like right here? And then how about the jalopy? Perfect. Whoa. Can I actually
[4704.25s -> 4721.26s]  leave? Drake it Josh. What's wrong with you? Stop. Unfinished room. This room needs proper
[4721.26s -> 4739.13s]  flooring and wall coverings. Oh shit. Shut up. Paint. Oh, gray. Whatever. Page up, right?
[4739.13s -> 4761.83s]  Okay. It looks good. Veiled germa clones. They just stay in the weird hotel. Tank? Join the
[4761.83s -> 4778.49s]  military. This is a wish. Hold on. What are they? What are you watching? I thought that was a
[4778.49s -> 4788.79s]  PlayStation. Put a window into the room. What are you going to do? What are you going to tell? How
[4788.79s -> 4794.42s]  are you going to woohoo on your stream? No. No, there's not going to be any woohooing.
[4798.71s -> 4805.72s]  All right. Go to the bathroom. Take a bath. Take a dump. Brush your teeth. What time is it?
[4805.72s -> 4817.32s]  All right. It's 1240. Can you just go somewhere? Make preferred veer. Go to community lot. Go to
[4817.32s -> 4841.43s]  community lot. What does that mean? Whoa. Go to select destination. Graveyard? What are you doing?
[4841.43s -> 4853.24s]  Oh, I thought he was running. Why did you go to the graveyard? Holy shit. That was fast.
[4855.78s -> 4865.72s]  Your Sims record important events in their life. Okay. So what are they looking for? He wants a
[4865.72s -> 4872.14s]  theater production. Get a part-time tour of the mausoleum. Explore the catacombs.
[4872.14s -> 4890.31s]  Is everybody even here? Tillman Abbot. Engrave. What do you mean, engrave? I'm not going to
[4890.31s -> 4914.54s]  engrave somebody's stone. I don't even know this guy. Okay. What a spooky setting. Rad
[4914.54s -> 4917.82s]  Alberton just took a visit to the graveyard. He won't forget the creepy dark corner nor the
[4917.82s -> 4935.74s]  side of the ghosts. What ghosts? I'm not going to do this. Why can I do this? No, that's not right.
[4936.30s -> 4965.24s]  What about this one? Oh, Tatiana. Oh, no. Oh, don't want to mourn this one. What? Who is this?
[4965.72s -> 4986.33s]  You don't want to mourn this person. Why? Okay. There you go. Go explore the catacombs. All right.
[4986.33s -> 5001.93s]  Who's here? Wait, who's this? Does somebody live here? What is this place? Let's go. I'm going in
[5001.93s -> 5026.34s]  here. What the hell? What is this place? Why is there a bar down here? What the fuck? Who's down?
[5026.34s -> 5042.63s]  Who is this? Why is there a person down here? This is actually really weird. A mixologist.
[5043.51s -> 5062.20s]  All right. Examine this thing. This is a cultist. Um, okay. Well, let's be, let's go. Okay. Dance
[5062.20s -> 5086.44s]  together? Drinking milk? This is the weirdest shit ever. You're going to get sacrificed?
[5089.98s -> 5094.94s]  I'm going to order a, let's buy a round of drinks for everybody. I only have $500.
[5101.16s -> 5109.16s]  You're going to get haunted? Can you actually get haunted? All right. At least I'm having fun.
[5113.94s -> 5125.98s]  Stop this. It's still going. You know the weirdest part about this? None,
[5125.98s -> 5134.28s]  neither one of us has spoken a word. Zero. No interaction. We're just doing this. Stop. All
[5134.28s -> 5146.14s]  right. Enough. All right. Let's buy a drink. Around for everybody here.
[5146.14s -> 5153.98s]  Morning the loss. What an odd slab of stone. Gazing at it makes me sleepy and thirsty.
[5154.62s -> 5171.83s]  What? All right. Let's get around drinks for everybody. Have we changed to something else?
[5173.82s -> 5181.74s]  Lie down on the stone. I can't think of an easier way to make sure that the rest of my life sucks
[5182.38s -> 5191.43s]  and to lay down on a weird coffin that I don't know what's in there. Romantic drink.
[5191.43s -> 5214.78s]  All right. Let's get them. Did you make a soup? Hey, those are mine. Those are my drinks. Put
[5214.78s -> 5238.66s]  that down. You can't have two. That was for everybody. What is Bugleberry doing? Oh,
[5238.66s -> 5269.93s]  scraps. Give me them. Form a special angler. Let's be really rude.
[5279.80s -> 5282.44s]  Where am I going? Oh, I have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to check on Bugleberry.
[5283.00s -> 5299.16s]  He's still just watching TV. He hasn't done anything. Having a blast. Bernard is having so
[5299.16s -> 5311.40s]  much fun. It's almost criminal. All right. I'm hungry. I need to eat some. What are food?
[5311.96s -> 5333.66s]  Can I sleep here? I want a single... Oh, wait. Who bought... $27? $27 bucks for a junk stew.
[5341.32s -> 5347.18s]  Oh, I was going to see if I could eat it. I guess I should say hello. All right. Just converse.
[5350.90s -> 5369.94s]  Let's give mixology advice. I got to go home. What's wrong here? Creepy graveyard. There was
[5369.94s -> 5387.61s]  a little too much ice in that drink. We need to make some friends. Why did you hang out at
[5387.61s -> 5401.66s]  the creepy graveyard? I just saw it was available. I just clicked it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[5401.66s -> 5411.13s]  whoa. Wait. Don't get mad. Wait, she likes me? That's more important. Hold on.
[5415.98s -> 5419.74s]  Rad is okay. Oh, I thought... My name is Rad. She doesn't think I'm Rad.
[5419.74s -> 5437.22s]  Okay. Um, romantic. Ask sign. I hate Rad. Why? Why?
[5446.87s -> 5451.34s]  Is it still dark? Scorpio. Those signs are compatible.
[5453.82s -> 5463.99s]  Scorpio. All right. How about... Are you single?
[5467.69s -> 5475.98s]  I need to turn the brightness up. Are you guys single?
[5479.18s -> 5491.50s]  On the stone? That is so fucked up. That is so fucked up. You almost should tie that person
[5491.50s -> 5495.74s]  out for like 30 seconds, right? We have to give something. We have to like give you some,
[5495.74s -> 5498.94s]  like a little slap. We have to give you something, right? Because like, go on.
[5501.38s -> 5516.70s]  That's a 30 second timeout. Are we flirting? This music is terrifying to have in the background.
[5521.21s -> 5529.37s]  Okay. I know she's a Scorpio. Make... No, no, I'm not going to ruin it.
[5534.95s -> 5544.18s]  The sims just became friends with another sim. Cool. Okay. What's her name? Margarita.
[5545.14s -> 5552.86s]  Margarita Savoy. Single. Who did you guys meet? Oh, next to a fucking dead vampire.
[5559.34s -> 5582.41s]  Is he naked? Can you turn the TV off? Good. All right. He's asleep. Okay. You're very alluring.
[5583.13s -> 5588.30s]  What are you doing? Watch the neck. Watch the neck. She's going to bite the neck.
[5588.30s -> 5593.54s]  This is where she goes like... And her teeth. She's got these huge fangs and she's just like...
[5601.72s -> 5605.27s]  All right. I got to go to bed. I'll call her tomorrow.
[5606.07s -> 5622.42s]  All right. It's time to go home. Go, go, go. I haven't had enough of this.
[5623.22s -> 5631.58s]  They're just doing this on their own. Somebody has work tomorrow. I'm really high. Can I get a
[5631.58s -> 5641.53s]  hell yeah? Have a good time. Romantic visibility. Your sims started a new relationship in a
[5641.53s -> 5644.97s]  neighborhood like this. It definitely won't go unnoticed. Would you like to learn more about
[5644.97s -> 5664.04s]  romantic visibility? Give him a hell yeah. All right. Hell yeah. Hell yeah, dude. All right. Go
[5664.04s -> 5683.27s]  home. Looks good. Speed it up a little bit. He's going to get up. What does he need? Hunger? Bladder?
[5683.27s -> 5689.34s]  I need money. You're going to get a job, Bugleberry. Like now. Is the paper here somewhere?
[5689.98s -> 5698.54s]  Donate to Burgess Hogan United? Donate to secret squids? It wouldn't mean donate.
[5698.54s -> 5704.39s]  Brad Albertson is sleeping on a community lot. He always remembered getting so tired that he
[5704.39s -> 5720.01s]  decided to wait. What? I sleep in the graveyard? All right. Get up, get up, get up, get up.
[5722.89s -> 5736.86s]  Big lemon. Get up and go home. Where's the car? Where's the car? 3 a.m. challenge.
[5739.46s -> 5748.06s]  Guys, Spider-Man has called my phone at 3 a.m. Don't answer the phone. Thanos called me at 3 a.m.
[5748.06s -> 5759.37s]  Got the Joker called me at 3 a.m. Don't answer it. It sounds like they have Buddy in like a
[5761.40s -> 5768.74s]  party store costume. Oh, Spider-Man. Oh, no. Spider-Man's here. It just looks like he's
[5768.74s -> 5777.08s]  in the Spider-Man pajama outfit. He's getting like waving like he's shooting the web into the
[5777.88s -> 5787.27s]  camera. And it never sounds like any of the characters either. I've seen a lot of these
[5787.27s -> 5792.78s]  videos. Trust me. Like, oh, dude, Thanos. Don't answer the phone at 3 a.m. Thanos is calling.
[5792.78s -> 5805.82s]  What do I do? Guys, Thanos. Answer. Hello? Hey, you called me. You're dead. What?
[5811.88s -> 5815.32s]  Sus guy at 3 a.m. Should I? All right. I'll make that video. I swear to God.
[5821.59s -> 5826.47s]  I swear to God. I will make this up. Don't answer the phone from the sus guy at 3 a.m.
[5828.06s -> 5830.06s]  It's not going to take very much time, right?
[5838.87s -> 5844.23s]  Do not call the sus guy. Yeah. Yeah, that's another funny part. It's like, oh, do not call
[5844.23s -> 5849.05s]  Spider-Man, right? How did you get? Why does Spider-Man have like a random cell phone number?
[5849.05s -> 5853.69s]  They always call and Spider-Man answers and it's like annoyed that they called.
[5855.29s -> 5858.33s]  Like, why are you calling me? Would you get this number?
[5859.29s -> 5863.61s]  Why does fucking Dracula have a cell phone number? Why does Thanos have a cell phone? But if you
[5863.61s -> 5878.66s]  think about it, he would, wouldn't he? Wouldn't Thanos have a cell phone number? No. Why not,
[5878.66s -> 5891.77s]  though? Remember, those videos are for children. Dude, do not call this person at 3. Go to bed.
[5891.77s -> 5905.77s]  What are you doing? Get in here. Oh, no, he's awake. And this is fictional, but he's from
[5905.77s -> 5909.05s]  another galaxy. Yeah, but if he was going to be on Earth for a significant amount of time,
[5909.05s -> 5915.74s]  you would think he would want a communication device that worked. Why do you guys think that
[5915.74s -> 5919.98s]  his alien technology is going to get the signal to be able to work on Earth? We have our own signal
[5919.98s -> 5931.06s]  system, our own network system. Guys, 5G does not work on like Jupiter's moon. His cool tech will
[5931.06s -> 5943.75s]  work in his own galaxy and shit, but why would it work here? How do you know? Haven't you seen
[5943.75s -> 5958.36s]  Independence Day? They just hijack our satellites. He has a heli- Thanos has a helicopter. Thanos does
[5958.36s -> 5970.55s]  not have a helicopter. But anyways, I will do the don't call the sus guy at 3 a.m. I have to make
[5970.55s -> 5978.54s]  that video. Now I need to. All right. What time is it? You have work soon, right? So I can just

[7897.20s -> 7899.20s]  Now you think it's funny. Don't you?
[7901.18s -> 7903.18s]  Now you want me to do aaron
[7904.80s -> 7917.47s]  I got a lot of shit for that
[7917.47s -> 7931.50s]  A lot of shit do the roar. What's up with the bathroom sink?
[7933.90s -> 7935.10s]  Oh
[7935.10s -> 7937.82s]  Yeah, what is up with the bathroom sink? It's fucking disgusting
[7941.90s -> 7951.31s]  I get one point at least so I can impress the guy. Okay. Good
[7952.18s -> 7953.70s]  Basics of piano
[7953.70s -> 7958.18s]  All right, you can stop stuff. Stop go to bed
[7958.26s -> 7963.01s]  Do I need food? No, I need to sleep. All right, you're done

[7967.52s -> 7978.21s]  I mean that was I half asked it but I did it
[7978.45s -> 7992.06s]  Do it again do it full power
[7995.68s -> 7996.64s]  All right
[7996.64s -> 8002.42s]  Fine aaron aaron aaron aaron
[8004.24s -> 8006.24s]  You know, I saw a thread somewhere that said that
[8007.47s -> 8010.75s]  I'm actually kind of sad that I have not that he has not done that in a while
[8011.15s -> 8018.66s]  It was like man like I actually kind of miss that he did that like he hasn't done it like two or three weeks
[8018.74s -> 8020.74s]  I'm I kind of miss it. There you go
[8023.02s -> 8032.18s]  84 bucks pay the bills
[8033.78s -> 8038.02s]  Oh, by the way, I can't wait to do the battleship tournament. That's probably I think that's happening this week
[8038.58s -> 8045.78s]  I want to say thursday or friday and i'm gonna i'm gonna confirm that with uh ludwig. Well, i'm in the semi-final. I moved on
[8047.90s -> 8049.90s]  Continuing my quest to continue to win
[8050.54s -> 8060.35s]  In the battleship tournament. All right, it's time for everybody to get up. Who cares omega lull
[8062.38s -> 8064.61s]  Well, whatever
[8064.61s -> 8069.55s]  Fine, you need a fucking garbage can. All right. I'm hold on
[8070.11s -> 8080.29s]  I need a garbage can
[8080.29s -> 8085.62s]  This video game consoles
[8085.62s -> 8092.08s]  All right. This thing's like 10 bucks
[8092.08s -> 8098.45s]  I'm at 25 dollars for a garbage can. Are you kidding me?
[8099.89s -> 8102.37s]  Is it really that expensive? This is like 10 years ago, too
[8102.93s -> 8120.13s]  But it's that germa really is just a sussy guy at this point. He has no star perspective. It just compiles
[8120.45s -> 8123.73s]  Implies it to whatever chat says it really makes me sad
[8127.58s -> 8131.34s]  If you missed the announcement, I will give you an announcement of the last announcement
[8132.06s -> 8134.94s]  Uh, we were doing a three day dollhouse stream
[8135.58s -> 8137.90s]  You guys get to control me in a house
[8139.66s -> 8145.42s]  We have an ex an incredibly extensive extension that is being made custom built for this purpose
[8145.82s -> 8149.28s]  It's gonna be a three day event
[8151.66s -> 8155.71s]  You guys will have a ton of control over pretty much everything
[8160.78s -> 8164.70s]  And the people that are working on the extension is ghost commander, which is kraken
[8165.26s -> 8167.47s]  And kraken's team
[8167.47s -> 8169.47s]  You've been aware of any things they've done before
[8170.03s -> 8172.03s]  They're putting a lot of time into this
[8178.99s -> 8180.43s]  What'd you do?
[8180.43s -> 8182.53s]  You've burnt it
[8182.53s -> 8192.66s]  That was disgusting
[8192.66s -> 8194.66s]  On top of that, we also have andy mark
[8195.63s -> 8200.75s]  Is participating completely they're on board as a full they're doing everything
[8201.39s -> 8205.74s]  But we've got this like trifecta team
[8208.83s -> 8212.22s]  Andy mark is back
[8212.22s -> 8219.68s]  And a lot more people on this project than any of the ones ever that you've ever seen here twitch is involved
[8222.30s -> 8234.74s]  We have a significant amount of financing from twitch. This is this is the big one practice the piano. He's still sleeping
[8245.97s -> 8254.29s]  Five bucks did you get vaccinated because you chose to get vaccinated? Uh, yes
[8256.46s -> 8258.46s]  part of the part of the I mean, obviously
[8259.97s -> 8261.97s]  This project has a lot of people on it
[8262.93s -> 8265.36s]  And i'm not fucking around
[8271.79s -> 8277.41s]  There's gonna be a significant amount of people that are gonna be coming and going through this whole project
[8277.90s -> 8282.46s]  So we're trying to err on the side of complete caution trying to get everybody vaccinated before the project
[8283.42s -> 8294.43s]  Um, because I am fucking around
[8294.43s -> 8297.02s]  Why'd you get jay and jay?
[8297.02s -> 8299.44s]  I got jay and jay because
[8299.44s -> 8301.38s]  by the time
[8301.38s -> 8304.74s]  That the project was going to be I mean august 18th, right?
[8306.06s -> 8312.67s]  If I had gotten one of the mrna vaccines, I would have had to get the second dose way too close to the project
[8313.33s -> 8316.85s]  and I am not taking the second dose of uh, the
[8317.33s -> 8322.86s]  Pfizer and moderna vaccines and getting wiped out from like two three four five days of side effects
[8324.37s -> 8326.77s]  Like the week of the stream because that's when it would have to line up
[8326.93s -> 8336.48s]  Like can you imagine like oh it's it's august like 16th time for your second dose of like Pfizer
[8337.76s -> 8341.02s]  And the stream is in fucking two days
[8341.02s -> 8347.47s]  I got the j&j vaccine and it wiped me out for like four days. I had a high fever
[8347.55s -> 8349.79s]  I felt like we could sloppy. Oh, yeah
[8350.50s -> 8355.14s]  So I was trying to make sure I could avoid any side effects and i'm glad I was able to do that
[8362.48s -> 8370.29s]  Have you been reacting to electronics at all weirdly? No, I can't say I have how does 5g taste?
[8370.69s -> 8393.87s]  All right, they hate this room. I gotta fix it. The social is fine. J&J knocked me out, too
[8395.04s -> 8403.36s]  Yeah, and I know we've got a bunch. What are you doing? Why are you watching this? This is weird
[8408.37s -> 8412.10s]  Um, I completely forgot what we were just talking about
[8415.04s -> 8419.12s]  Oh, it's because the one and done thing but the whole thing with the delta variant now
[8419.52s -> 8423.06s]  We're still trying to figure out how effective everything is
[8424.64s -> 8431.95s]  Is it that we're gonna need boosters? Should you take a booster? When should you do it? It's getting fit
[8438.48s -> 8445.33s]  But the one thing that I can say is being vaccinated at least at the very least it will be enough
[8445.73s -> 8450.88s]  Immunity built up for me not to have a major major problem, right?
[8450.96s -> 8454.56s]  Because if you see I think you can you can still technically what they call a breakthrough infection, right?
[8456.75s -> 8458.27s]  If you do get it
[8458.27s -> 8464.32s]  Then the theory is that you've built up some antibodies at least for your body to fight it and understand what it is
[8465.47s -> 8469.89s]  So you don't end up in the hospital
[8469.89s -> 8473.09s]  So maybe if you get covid you kind of feel like shit for a few days
[8473.33s -> 8479.73s]  Three or four or five days or something, but it keeps you out of the hospital and keeps a ventilator off your body and
[8480.38s -> 8487.68s]  I've got medical problems guys. I'm sure you're aware. I have all kinds of weird shit going on
[8488.78s -> 8500.21s]  I don't want to fucking end up in the hospital. You know, I I have
[8501.76s -> 8504.42s]  Colitis I have this mystery fucking chest pain
[8509.68s -> 8528.53s]  I don't want to end up in the hospital and plus like i'll also i'll gotta be really honest, too
[8528.61s -> 8535.01s]  Right when after I got the vaccine one of the things that I was always kind of concerned about and just kind of freaked
[8535.01s -> 8541.26s]  Out and everybody can relate to this. I think anytime you're out anywhere if you've like, oh i'm going to the grocery store
[8541.66s -> 8545.42s]  i'm at the i'm in the bread aisle and you just like hear two aisles over like
[8546.88s -> 8551.78s]  Like what the fuck was that? What was that motherfucker? Who was that? I'm out of here. I gotta go
[8551.78s -> 8557.14s]  I gotta get the fuck out of here immediately. I am running this other direction. I don't care if I need bread
[8557.14s -> 8558.82s]  I'll get it. I'll get it tomorrow
[8558.82s -> 8562.21s]  Right at least kind of gives me that
[8562.85s -> 8567.49s]  At least mental security that okay. I i've have some exposure to the virus
[8567.89s -> 8576.27s]  You hear if I hear anybody do that, I instantly just go the other direction you hear like a
[8578.37s -> 8584.45s]  Go to turn turn and you look back you're like fuck who the fuck was that?
[8584.69s -> 8589.12s]  God damn it. What are you doing here?
[8589.12s -> 8593.12s]  So it helps with that it helps kind of not make you have to freak out anytime you hear that
[8596.74s -> 8600.74s]  Touching any surface too. It's like oh, hold on. Let me get that door for you
[8602.02s -> 8607.95s]  I it's I just touch that I touch the door. I touched that I touched the door now i'm in trouble great
[8608.27s -> 8617.98s]  I gotta go wash my hands now. I've been doing i've been doing this to dine and dash for the past year
[8620.29s -> 8623.12s]  What?
[8623.12s -> 8625.12s]  Wait, wait, hold on a minute. Hold on. Wait
[8625.60s -> 8626.66s]  you
[8626.66s -> 8640.34s]  You've been dining and dashing because you hear somebody like what are you talking about? That's fucked up, man
[8640.98s -> 8648.27s]  That's wicked fucked up
[8648.43s -> 8655.81s]  I have my game
[8655.81s -> 8658.26s]  My game block
[8658.26s -> 8659.86s]  Hold on. Wait, wait
[8659.86s -> 8668.16s]  Oh, there we go. Okay
[8668.16s -> 8670.16s]  So
[8671.44s -> 8672.72s]  By anyways
[8672.72s -> 8675.97s]  The point i'm making is
[8675.97s -> 8682.53s]  It gives me at least enough comfort in my brain and i'd have to constantly and look I know that there's still risk there is right?
[8683.09s -> 8687.25s]  But it definitely makes me feel a bit better
[8687.25s -> 8691.78s]  Save the game. Oh shit. You're right
[8691.78s -> 8693.78s]  All right. Now it's time to run some ads
[8695.12s -> 8697.12s]  Those of you that missed
[8699.12s -> 8701.12s]  It's just like choked up
[8702.62s -> 8705.18s]  I'm fine. I just like choked on myself
[8705.74s -> 8707.90s]  Cringe ads, I just I know
[8712.70s -> 8719.44s]  Uh, we're gonna run i'm gonna go brb again. I'll be back. I'm out of here. No, I gotta go because I just

[8722.03s -> 8723.71s]  Don't run away
[8723.71s -> 8727.95s]  Okay, so we're gonna run some ads those of you that weren't here before. I want to make sure that you're aware
[8728.75s -> 8729.47s]  um
[8729.47s -> 8737.02s]  Because twitch has a significant financial involvement. They've given a lot of financial help for the streams coming up here in the next couple weeks
[8737.82s -> 8739.82s]  Uh, this is part of the agreement is to run ads
[8740.54s -> 8742.54s]  Every hour or so we're gonna run some
[8743.18s -> 8746.62s]  This is not a permanent solution. This is not a permanent thing
[8747.34s -> 8750.38s]  for this channel
[8750.38s -> 8753.10s]  This is just for the next i'd say a couple of weeks
[8753.98s -> 8757.42s]  Again, I want to make it really really clear again for those of you that weren't we you're not here
[8758.06s -> 8760.86s]  Um, i'm not going to make any money from these streams
[8761.88s -> 8763.66s]  Absolute zero
[8763.66s -> 8766.46s]  I will not I will not be making anything at all
[8767.50s -> 8769.98s]  Uh, this is just to make sure the production can go through without a hitch
[8770.62s -> 8773.66s]  So i'm gonna go brb we're gonna run a few minutes of ads and I will be right back

[9037.66s -> 9039.90s]  Uh, I would say it affects the middle left
[9040.70s -> 9042.70s]  And that goes all the way through the back
[9042.94s -> 9044.91s]  around my flank
[9044.91s -> 9046.67s]  Had a lot of tests
[9046.67s -> 9050.58s]  Still trying to figure it out. All right, let's keep going
[9056.08s -> 9058.08s]  Oh long each day of streaming
[9059.41s -> 9061.73s]  um, we're we're gonna have to gauge it because

[10227.50s -> 10230.03s]  vile surroundings

[10264.19s -> 10267.13s]  All right, you need I need this you have to fix this fix it
[10267.77s -> 10274.49s]  Fix the toilet
[10274.49s -> 10292.78s]  Whatever. All right, you fix the toilet. Somebody has to fix it. It's disgusting in here. Okay, clean it. This is gross
[10294.36s -> 10297.12s]  Clean this up
[10297.12s -> 10300.60s]  Clean the sink
[10300.60s -> 10310.64s]  All right. This is not gonna be so disgusting in here now. It's time for ads
[10311.44s -> 10314.00s]  Uh, let me check
[10315.58s -> 10332.80s]  Save it first. It's been 15 minutes. Yeah, it hasn't been long enough. Oh, no, don't eat that
[10334.84s -> 10337.16s]  Why are we still eating the same burnt waffles?
[10340.01s -> 10343.45s]  Oh she
[10343.45s -> 10347.82s]  Holy shit
[10347.82s -> 10350.94s]  All right for a second. I thought she's gonna get a fire engine and I would have laughed really hard
[10354.96s -> 10362.48s]  That's the first time she's left since coming to put the fire out. All right. We've got some uh, we're good to go
[10362.88s -> 10371.02s]  I need to go home now. Okay. Well now we're dating clean
[10373.55s -> 10376.56s]  Okay, I need to make something
[10376.80s -> 10379.85s]  serve breakfast
[10379.85s -> 10400.24s]  Waffles and then i'm gonna bring the waffles put them in my inventory and serve it eventually. I thought the bed was on fire
[10400.24s -> 10407.98s]  I was like, what the hell just wait for the next alarm and she will live there
[10408.62s -> 10417.74s]  What's wrong with the fridge?
[10417.74s -> 10421.64s]  That's a gas coming out of the fridge
[10429.92s -> 10431.04s]  big bits
[10431.04s -> 10436.35s]  Yeah, as of as of like a year ago or seven or eight months ago or so
[10437.07s -> 10439.07s]  They no longer read bits
[10441.72s -> 10452.12s]  Uh, I mean I read them. It's not on stream. We talked about a while ago why that was
[10452.68s -> 10463.55s]  There's a few reasons why
[10463.55s -> 10466.27s]  Huge bits ignored ads not ran
[10471.42s -> 10476.00s]  You're a monster
[10476.00s -> 10481.12s]  No, we talked about this because it used to be I mean that there's a lot of people that potentially knew here
[10481.76s -> 10483.76s]  So let's we'll go over it very quickly
[10484.64s -> 10486.64s]  It used to be that anything over
[10486.80s -> 10491.12s]  I think was 250 in bits. I would read at the end of the screen. We'd have like a hangout session
[10492.04s -> 10494.04s]  um, but over the years
[10494.04s -> 10496.59s]  I kind of wanted to
[10496.59s -> 10499.23s]  There's two main reasons why it was pretty much 50 50
[10500.17s -> 10503.77s]  Is I didn't I want to stop incentivizing people to have to like pay
[10504.17s -> 10506.81s]  For me to like talk to them or read what they said
[10507.37s -> 10510.65s]  I don't want you to have to give me like 50 bucks for me to
[10511.53s -> 10517.63s]  Read what you said. It's a lot of money 100 bucks 50 bucks 20 bucks. That's a lot of money and
[10518.35s -> 10520.59s]  I would rather not incentivize people
[10521.07s -> 10522.03s]  to
[10522.03s -> 10524.22s]  Spend a bunch of money
[10524.22s -> 10526.40s]  With the hope that I would read their message
[10527.12s -> 10529.12s]  Um, it just kind of makes me uncomfortable
[10529.52s -> 10533.69s]  And the second part is because we used to those end of the stream segments used to be
[10534.49s -> 10537.53s]  Sometimes two hours long where we would just sit there and hang out
[10538.75s -> 10539.63s]  and
[10539.63s -> 10543.60s]  just talk
[10543.60s -> 10545.02s]  so
[10545.02s -> 10550.49s]  That's why I kind of got rid of it. You're an anti-money streamer
[10551.71s -> 10552.99s]  No, i'm not
[10552.99s -> 10554.99s]  Not really. I mean, I just
[10557.15s -> 10559.63s]  I just don't want to like encourage and incentivize people
[10560.19s -> 10562.83s]  To drop like 100 bucks for me to look over and read what you said
[10564.04s -> 10566.04s]  That's such an extreme amount of money
[10566.28s -> 10569.64s]  And what was happening was I was reading the big ones
[10570.36s -> 10573.32s]  So I was like, oh well, I got rid of the little ones like 250
[10573.40s -> 10577.08s]  But I get I mean i'll read the ones that are like 100 bucks. That's a lot of money, right?
[10577.16s -> 10578.52s]  I'm gonna read it
[10578.52s -> 10580.52s]  And it was incentivizing people to spend a hundred dollars
[10583.13s -> 10586.01s]  Uh, I don't want you to have to spend a hundred bucks to have me read your message
[10586.65s -> 10589.92s]  Somebody clean the fridge for god's sakes. Come on
[10596.12s -> 10599.13s]  Clean out bad food. There we go
[10599.21s -> 10602.17s]  Stop looking at it. What are you doing? That's that's how you make sure it doesn't cook at all
[10607.60s -> 10624.60s]  This thing can't even preheat and I still read out community sub sometimes like somebody gave 50 community subs before
[10625.24s -> 10629.32s]  But I think the difference between saying like thanks for like the 50 community subs, right?
[10629.96s -> 10631.13s]  is
[10631.13s -> 10634.30s]  People in the community are getting a sub you're able to
[10634.94s -> 10639.02s]  Uh the sub only stuff you're able to do the emotes and it's a little bit more
[10639.58s -> 10641.66s]  Tangible than just you just gave me
[10642.30s -> 10644.62s]  like a 500 dollars or something
[10646.24s -> 10648.24s]  Uh, but i've struggled with that for a long time
[10648.96s -> 10650.96s]  of trying to figure out
[10651.12s -> 10654.65s]  You know people give you a bunch of money. It's like oh shit. That's a lot of fucking money
[10655.29s -> 10657.29s]  Thanks for the that's a
[10657.53s -> 10659.13s]  extreme amount of money
[10659.13s -> 10660.17s]  um
[10660.17s -> 10662.17s]  I've always been essentially more comfortable people
[10663.26s -> 10664.94s]  treating this stream
[10664.94s -> 10666.94s]  Like you would treat something like netflix
[10667.26s -> 10671.90s]  You know like oh, it's just i'm gonna it's if you can want to give five dollars a month
[10672.46s -> 10674.46s]  You can you don't have to
[10674.94s -> 10677.24s]  I don't expect anybody to
[10677.32s -> 10680.62s]  But I don't it's it's not like okay, so if you had like a netflix subscription
[10681.26s -> 10686.62s]  You're also not giving netflix like 50 more dollars a month because you want to right you just yeah
[10686.70s -> 10689.34s]  I guess i'm I have to say it's 10 bucks a month or whatever, right?
[10694.94s -> 10696.94s]  Oh, dude free netflix. He's serious
[10698.70s -> 10701.74s]  Um, but I don't want anyone to ever think they have to give this channel money
[10703.36s -> 10706.88s]  You don't have to there's no reason for you to do so if you do
[10707.84s -> 10711.36s]  It's beyond my wildest expectations that people would pay five
[10712.16s -> 10714.24s]  Plus dollars to this stream every month. It's insane
[10717.66s -> 10720.46s]  So
[10720.46s -> 10723.50s]  I just don't I don't want people to think that they have to give money to this channel
[10727.70s -> 10729.62s]  So it's time for some ads
[10729.62s -> 10747.06s]  I wonder how many subs you just picked up with this conversation
[10747.52s -> 10752.16s]  And that's why I never like to really talk about this that frequently because I haven't been to work once
[10752.64s -> 10754.64s]  This character has not been to work one time
[10755.20s -> 10757.20s]  Um, i'm not gonna get fired because i'm not gonna answer the phone
[10757.76s -> 10759.76s]  So, you know thinking face
[10760.98s -> 10776.27s]  Oh, he got a raise
[10776.27s -> 10778.27s]  I'm practicing the piano leave me alone
[10778.75s -> 10780.70s]  Oh don't answer the phone
[10780.70s -> 10799.38s]  Just don't answer it. Oh shit the waffles. All right
[10800.96s -> 10802.88s]  Once I get this next point in music
[10802.88s -> 10810.75s]  Okay, put in put away. How do I put it in my inventory?
[10821.30s -> 10823.30s]  Oh shit, you got a bonus
[10823.70s -> 10825.54s]  All right, go to the bathroom quick
[10825.54s -> 10830.75s]  So you get promoted
[10830.75s -> 10834.19s]  Congratulations rads impressive performance has earned a promotion to a roadie
[10834.67s -> 10839.31s]  The band is going to need their sandwiches and soda as soon as possible. Don't forget to pick up their laundry
[10840.62s -> 10843.74s]  That's right. Rad is the music career. I'm the chef career yet
[10843.98s -> 10846.70s]  Rad has more cooking points and I have more music points
[10847.66s -> 10850.48s]  Don't go to work
[10850.96s -> 10853.12s]  Three hours late for work and you're gonna go
[10855.04s -> 10857.04s]  They're like four hours late
[10858.64s -> 10881.06s]  No, I i'm not there's no way i'm going to work the day is almost over. I think I actually oh we're gonna the diner

[10894.13s -> 10896.77s]  Don't make empty promises especially when it comes to delicious food
[10902.62s -> 10904.38s]  All right time to leave
[10904.38s -> 10912.06s]  I was only there for like 40 minutes

[11155.47s -> 11158.51s]  Uh

[12931.04s -> 12934.45s]  It's haunting me. It's been haunting me for like the last three and a half hours
[12944.83s -> 12946.83s]  Uh now I can wash the dishes here
[12947.79s -> 12949.79s]  I don't want to do this chef thing anymore
[12954.82s -> 12956.58s]  Okay, wash the dishes
[12956.58s -> 12968.46s]  What's wrong with you? All right get up
[12969.26s -> 12973.94s]  Why do you guys want me to keep the termites? What is that what to do?
[12977.26s -> 12995.34s]  That's not carpet. Isn't it linoleum? I'm not going to answer it. Whatever. It's too late
[12998.69s -> 13002.21s]  Uh an eccentric conductor ran through wilkie's fabulous books
[13003.65s -> 13006.05s]  Organized music at wilkie's fabulous books
[13009.86s -> 13010.58s]  No
[13010.58s -> 13012.26s]  No, I don't care

[13051.49s -> 13055.17s]  Stay at work until late to improve your relationship with your co-workers. Yeah, sure
[13055.89s -> 13057.97s]  Maybe i'll make some money
[13057.97s -> 13060.85s]  All right. Now he's going to work business as usual
[13065.94s -> 13070.99s]  His plates are so clean you can practically eat off them the chef is quite happy happy enough that your job performance has improved
[13070.99s -> 13072.99s]  All right. Why am I still a chef?
[13072.99s -> 13085.22s]  What if I need to level up here
[13085.70s -> 13086.98s]  career
[13086.98s -> 13088.98s]  I might actually get promoted now
[13089.38s -> 13091.38s]  That's a good performance
[13091.46s -> 13102.91s]  And when you get back eat some pancakes
[13102.99s -> 13111.23s]  All right bernard is left

[13116.27s -> 13124.14s]  Are you supposed to do a bunch of dishes or something? Yeah, I did
[13125.52s -> 13127.04s]  I had to bring them in
[13127.04s -> 13128.72s]  I want to do this too

[13166.38s -> 13179.25s]  All right. Stop watching tv get up
[13179.65s -> 13186.43s]  I thought we were the drew crew. That's right. You were
[13190.02s -> 13191.94s]  We bet on something dumb
[13191.94s -> 13195.10s]  You'll have an opportunity
[13195.10s -> 13196.78s]  You could sell the car
[13196.78s -> 13217.84s]  Isn't like the tv being on it's why am I waking up at two o'clock in the morning eat and then go back to bed
[13224.94s -> 13226.62s]  seize control
[13226.62s -> 13230.59s]  Did I sell the car? No, I need that
[13240.22s -> 13248.90s]  Back to bed. How are you doing? Brad is uh, I feel like I already did that
[13249.38s -> 13263.86s]  It's time for ads. I don't think so. Not quite still good eat
[13264.50s -> 13268.06s]  Watch a little bit of tv
[13268.06s -> 13271.07s]  Oh fuck. I need to repair it
[13275.14s -> 13277.14s]  That's gonna get you on the roof in like 30
[13280.42s -> 13291.60s]  These guys haven't spoken to each other in a week. I'm not sure they've ever spoken to each other
[13292.00s -> 13294.50s]  Maybe when I first came
[13294.50s -> 13306.83s]  To the house before it was built. All right, take a shower real quick. Come on. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. You want good
[13307.71s -> 13319.81s]  Performance good performance good performance. Good. All right now you i'm gonna get out of this chef career and go do music

[13357.94s -> 13373.34s]  Don't go to work stay
[13373.58s -> 13376.05s]  What what?
[13376.05s -> 13381.04s]  What was it a goopy?
[13382.30s -> 13384.48s]  Carbonara carbonara
[13389.25s -> 13391.25s]  He's almost gonna level up again. Nice
[13397.50s -> 13399.50s]  Keep working out. You're almost done
[13407.97s -> 13418.21s]  Level five
[13418.21s -> 13429.79s]  Gooey, who cares about like dracula i'm about to level up my point anyways, so i'll get points
[13447.06s -> 13452.69s]  There we go also visit the bookstore sometime to purchase a new song
[13456.02s -> 13458.10s]  Learn a new piano composition. Yeah, let's do it
[13458.98s -> 13462.29s]  Go to the bookstore
[13462.37s -> 13466.78s]  You need to pee
[13468.42s -> 13470.40s]  pee
[13470.40s -> 13474.80s]  Go to sleep and then when you get up in the morning, you're going to go to the bookstore and you're going to learn some new songs
[13475.52s -> 13483.79s]  Somebody said the stream day is going to be a subathon style stream. I don't really know what that means
[13485.09s -> 13487.09s]  a subathon style stream
[13487.49s -> 13500.59s]  What's that mean?
[13500.59s -> 13502.91s]  Every sub means more stream time
[13504.94s -> 13506.94s]  Oh, no
[13506.94s -> 13509.58s]  No
[13509.58s -> 13514.27s]  There's very specific rules that you will see and the reason why I do
[13515.07s -> 13520.86s]  Three streams. There's a lot of reason why so you guys be in the past
[13521.50s -> 13523.18s]  when we've done
[13523.18s -> 13526.24s]  A big project or something with the carnival or geology
[13526.94s -> 13529.25s]  It's a one and done thing
[13529.33s -> 13530.29s]  where
[13530.29s -> 13532.29s]  You only really have
[13532.37s -> 13534.69s]  Two three four hours to even understand what's going on
[13535.63s -> 13538.03s]  So this time because it's going to be three days
[13539.07s -> 13541.07s]  There's going to be plenty of time
[13541.15s -> 13543.15s]  To understand how the game works
[13543.15s -> 13544.03s]  to
[13544.03s -> 13546.03s]  kind of tutorialize yourself
[13546.27s -> 13548.27s]  uh to learn how to play it and everything so
[13549.17s -> 13551.57s]  We'll have a solid bold day or two
[13552.96s -> 13554.30s]  for
[13554.30s -> 13558.08s]  This tons of time. So don't worry
[13558.08s -> 13560.32s]  It is not going to be a three day straight
[13561.26s -> 13564.62s]  So there will be time in between the streams the streams will turn off
[13569.02s -> 13571.76s]  it's not a
[13571.76s -> 13573.76s]  life sim
[13573.84s -> 13575.52s]  It's not a life simulator
[13575.52s -> 13578.48s]  Where the cameras are rolling 24 7 and you guys have to control my whole life
[13583.58s -> 13585.98s]  I mean, it's gonna be a life simulator, but
[13586.80s -> 13602.27s]  Not 24 7 ever consider recycling some stream ideas. Yeah all the time
[13606.40s -> 13611.12s]  Yeah, it's it's less of a truman show and more of an interactive experience where you guys
[13611.76s -> 13614.96s]  Play around with a ton of stuff
[13614.96s -> 13618.56s]  And me too. I'm gonna have tons of things to play around with so don't you worry
[13619.28s -> 13621.38s]  special guests
[13621.38s -> 13622.82s]  Lots of stuff to do
[13622.82s -> 13636.10s]  It'll be fun
[13636.10s -> 13638.10s]  How do you even rehearse that kind of thing?
[13641.70s -> 13642.83s]  well
[13642.83s -> 13649.70s]  Um, it's very new territory. So it is not much rehearsing that can be done
[13650.67s -> 13657.60s]  We're just gonna go for it. There's gonna be a shitload of time before the stream
[13658.16s -> 13661.87s]  Where we're gonna make sure everything works and is ready
[13670.80s -> 13673.44s]  It's not just gonna be a oh, well, it's it's august 18th
[13673.52s -> 13679.70s]  I guess we're gonna see if this thing even turns on I mean that stuff that's not being worked on right now
[13680.02s -> 13682.02s]  That stuff has been being worked on since
[13683.07s -> 13689.74s]  God i'm gonna say june may I want to say is when that started really getting hammered on
[13690.14s -> 13697.52s]  He's gonna be doing lots of acting
[13697.52s -> 13699.15s]  I bet you
[13699.15s -> 13710.54s]  Are you food? Whoa, whoa, whoa?
[13711.02s -> 13720.03s]  Fix that clean that up
[13720.27s -> 13727.58s]  Am I feeding the fish?
[13727.58s -> 13731.68s]  Jesus. All right. I was in a bookstore. I'm gonna go to the bookstore
[13734.29s -> 13736.29s]  first, let me pee
[13737.01s -> 13738.85s]  Have a quick lunch
[13738.85s -> 13740.85s]  Of bread and jam and we're gonna go
[13744.67s -> 13749.23s]  Is it gonna be in sim in like a a simlish no like a different language no
[13749.87s -> 13755.20s]  Yeah talks
[13755.20s -> 13758.40s]  We thought about having it be sort of pantomimed
[13759.20s -> 13762.58s]  but
[13762.58s -> 13765.38s]  It probably would have got old very very quickly
[13766.02s -> 13770.37s]  So no, it's not gonna be in a different language or anything
[13771.33s -> 13778.10s]  What are you guys doing?
[13778.82s -> 13784.83s]  These streams are gonna be boring. I
[13785.55s -> 13790.19s]  I highly doubt that you all right here. Here's what i'll tell you about them without revealing what we're gonna do
[13791.90s -> 13793.10s]  um
[13793.10s -> 13799.26s]  The one thing that I can guarantee whether you love or hate these streams that are going to happen in a couple weeks
[13800.99s -> 13802.99s]  They're definitely not going to be boring
[13804.06s -> 13808.14s]  You might hate these but you can at least you'll probably you'll come away from it probably at least saying
[13808.78s -> 13814.86s]  I was kind of fucking insane what they did because it's not just as simple as
[13818.16s -> 13822.72s]  I don't even want to tell you I don't even want to just it's not it's not what you might some of you might think it is
[13823.36s -> 13826.98s]  Like let's put it this way. I know a lot of you probably think it's going to be
[13827.94s -> 13829.06s]  this
[13829.06s -> 13830.67s]  stream where
[13830.67s -> 13835.55s]  Oh, he's just sitting on the couch and we told him to watch tv and we told him to go pee
[13836.19s -> 13838.19s]  This will be fun for three days
[13838.64s -> 13844.80s]  It's not what's gonna happen. I'm not going to tell you anything, but it's going to be
[13845.60s -> 13848.77s]  a wild ride for three straight days
[13855.70s -> 13857.70s]  Have I deleted channel points yet? Why?
[13858.42s -> 13867.02s]  Why am I saying this?
[13867.02s -> 13871.26s]  And sure, I mean this I want to experiment to see what you guys do
[13872.32s -> 13874.80s]  You guys are gonna have a lot more control than I think you realize
[13875.20s -> 13887.95s]  All right, where are we going? I need all right right I entered uh the bookstore go to the can I
[13888.67s -> 13890.88s]  I have the thing in my inventory, right?
[13890.88s -> 13892.50s]  Yeah, okay
[13892.50s -> 13894.02s]  All right bookstore
[13894.02s -> 13902.24s]  I'm gonna go buy a new song and i'm gonna play at the bookstore. Where's the bookstore art gallery?
[13902.96s -> 13905.52s]  Is that it?
[13905.52s -> 13910.94s]  What's a bookstore?
[13910.94s -> 13918.58s]  Public library
[13918.58s -> 13925.78s]  Where is this place?
[13925.78s -> 13932.18s]  deep fried diner
[13934.85s -> 13938.02s]  Butterfly
[13938.02s -> 13939.46s]  Isn't this place?
[13939.46s -> 13941.46s]  The bright more isn't that a bookstore?
[13941.86s -> 13946.08s]  The red book under the candle
[13946.64s -> 13956.37s]  isn't this
[13956.37s -> 13957.73s]  science
[13957.73s -> 13959.50s]  public school
[13959.50s -> 13967.92s]  Where the hell is this place?
[13967.92s -> 13972.90s]  hospital
[13972.90s -> 13975.73s]  Cemetery
[13975.73s -> 13978.61s]  Where is this bookstore? Can I just call and go there?
[13979.79s -> 13981.39s]  Why can't I see it?
[13981.39s -> 13983.55s]  Go to the oh jesus god. It's right here
[13994.30s -> 13996.30s]  All right, I need to buy some specific things
[13996.70s -> 14006.74s]  It's doing all right
[14006.74s -> 14008.74s]  So I need to buy a new song
[14010.14s -> 14012.14s]  Recipes, all right sheet music
[14015.04s -> 14018.08s]  piano level five summer hayrides, that sounds good
[14020.16s -> 14021.52s]  piano level six
[14021.52s -> 14023.92s]  Uh, sure. These are expensive. Can I afford these?
[14024.64s -> 14030.34s]  Don't forget the musty smell of the old books
[14031.30s -> 14040.61s]  I love books. Okay earn 25 from tips. He looks like he's just doing it
[14041.25s -> 14044.75s]  He's just doing it
[14044.75s -> 14054.21s]  Who's this addy crew?
[14055.17s -> 14063.81s]  You're playing for the pigeons
[14064.61s -> 14069.09s]  Now i'm playing for this guy
[14073.68s -> 14075.94s]  um
[14075.94s -> 14077.62s]  You liked that?
[14077.62s -> 14079.86s]  Oh, it was nice to meet you
[14079.86s -> 14081.86s]  You want to make a band?
[14091.54s -> 14094.22s]  The name of the band
[14094.62s -> 14106.91s]  Let's die
[14110.72s -> 14113.68s]  Get on any instrument to build your sims musical skills
[14114.77s -> 14117.09s]  Once you practice enough on it, you can have a band
[14117.65s -> 14119.65s]  Start a band by talking to somebody
[14119.97s -> 14122.43s]  After forming a band your sim will be ready to play some gigs
[14122.43s -> 14132.42s]  Be sure to answer your sim's phone or you'll miss out on those gig offers. Okay, cool. All right, so we gotta watch out for this phone
[14133.14s -> 14135.14s]  We're in a band together
[14135.14s -> 14137.14s]  That's so cool
[14140.59s -> 14143.87s]  Nice law firm piano and piano are so sweet
[14145.71s -> 14147.71s]  Ads it's time for ads
[14147.87s -> 14150.19s]  Is it an ad type? I don't think it is
[14151.71s -> 14153.71s]  Is it ad andy it might be
[14157.14s -> 14163.90s]  What the fuck was that you want to join our band? Oh matilda's going home. What about you? You want to join a band?
[14174.34s -> 14179.07s]  Nice to meet you. Uh, okay friendly you want to join the band?
[14183.70s -> 14185.46s]  Before budgie
[14185.46s -> 14187.86s]  Ads, all right. Yeah. Yeah, but yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I got it
[14187.86s -> 14191.76s]  I got I got it on the top of the hour every hour
[14193.34s -> 14196.53s]  At least for today the next stream that I do
[14197.25s -> 14200.85s]  Is not going to have ads ran on it. I want to make that clear as well
[14208.14s -> 14213.78s]  Let's see, how many what can we do? All right, we're gonna do another three minutes three minute break here
[14215.95s -> 14219.63s]  Thank you for your patience to everybody. So i'll be back in three
[14224.48s -> 14228.40s]  Then I think we're only gonna need to do this like one more time at the end of the stream
[14232.53s -> 14236.85s]  Why is this happening somebody asked? Uh, they probably just came in. So the reason why this is happening
[14238.05s -> 14240.05s]  is twitch has
[14240.61s -> 14242.61s]  Ponied up a significant amount of money
[14243.47s -> 14246.67s]  To make sure that the dollhouse stream happens
[14248.11s -> 14251.87s]  I would dare say that if we did not have the financial backing from twitch
[14252.75s -> 14254.75s]  We would probably not be able to do this
[14255.31s -> 14257.63s]  It would be very very hard for me to do it on my own
[14258.59s -> 14260.59s]  So as part of that agreement
[14261.34s -> 14263.98s]  Some of these streams here that you're gonna watch are gonna have ad breaks
[14264.54s -> 14291.55s]  That's it. Here we go three minutes. I'll see you in three minutes. Oh, yeah, some of you still here capitalist andy
[14293.22s -> 14297.78s]  Well, wouldn't capitalist andy imply that like i'm gonna make a bunch of money from this endeavor
[14301.04s -> 14305.04s]  Now it's all going to the production all of it every single cent
[14305.92s -> 14308.64s]  And then some
[14308.64s -> 14315.44s]  And then some it's an investment. I mean you could look at it like that. Maybe sure
[14320.06s -> 14322.46s]  We have to pay for the germa dlc somehow
[14335.60s -> 14338.06s]  Stop pretending
[14338.06s -> 14340.48s]  No, this is the real deal
[14340.48s -> 14344.16s]  If I was if I was gonna run ads, I would want you to be completely transparent on this
[14352.90s -> 14354.82s]  ads ads ads ads
[14354.82s -> 14356.82s]  He's pretending to care
[14360.03s -> 14361.71s]  No, I
[14361.71s -> 14367.42s]  It's I I don't have to say anything. I don't say anything. I'm a doctor too
[14369.02s -> 14371.02s]  Your subs get ads. I actually don't know
[14371.60s -> 14384.34s]  They changed that recently subs get ads. I thought they did maybe they don't ignore the rude comments
[14384.42s -> 14386.42s]  I don't I actually don't see very many
[14387.31s -> 14391.47s]  So this is you know, it's it's a scary thing to do something never done before
[14393.06s -> 14397.09s]  um, I was thinking about this for a long time of
[14398.24s -> 14403.84s]  I'm going to be running ads. We're bringing on a few partners essentially for this project
[14404.74s -> 14409.78s]  I just hope you understand that everything that is done is done to try to make the best possible stream I can possibly do
[14412.00s -> 14417.76s]  So I don't I think people would know i'm not seeing anybody saying anything people you guys have been very very supportive
[14418.98s -> 14435.03s]  Which is crazy. Is there a date? Yes august 18th at 3 pm eastern august 20th
[14435.78s -> 14452.74s]  At 3 pm eastern and august 21st at 12 pm eastern. Those are the three dates and the three times that the stream will be live
[14457.79s -> 14460.11s]  Why is the third stream at a different time? That's a good question
[14461.07s -> 14465.47s]  The reason why the third stream is at a different time is so we potentially have more time
[14466.35s -> 14468.03s]  For the for the day
[14468.03s -> 14473.09s]  We want to make sure we have a lot of time
[14473.49s -> 14475.81s]  So starting earlier means we can go longer
[14476.45s -> 14482.90s]  Especially on that third day, which would be the last day of the event. I guess you could call it
[14488.45s -> 14494.85s]  I'm a bad listener. What day is august 18th august 20th and the 21st of august of 2021
[14494.93s -> 14500.18s]  Which means in about two weeks two weeks from now if we read about the dates
[14500.58s -> 14504.74s]  You're probably going to see a very very heavy amount of promotion here
[14505.46s -> 14507.46s]  over the next week or two
[14507.46s -> 14509.46s]  from more than one source, so
[14510.10s -> 14518.74s]  You will know as long as you pay a little bit of attention. Are you going to last three days?
[14519.38s -> 14525.62s]  I hope so never done it that anything like that before but that was another part of the point to put the day in between
[14526.72s -> 14528.00s]  so do
[14528.00s -> 14530.72s]  The 18th and then all right. How am I doing?
[14531.36s -> 14532.56s]  Give me a day
[14532.56s -> 14541.02s]  Give everybody a day then we come back again. You're not streaming on my birthday. Uh, i'm sorry
[14544.02s -> 14546.02s]  Anybody collaborating with you on this?
[14546.56s -> 14556.08s]  Yes, there'll be some special guests and we will uh, we will tell you who those people are very very soon
[14556.16s -> 14563.95s]  I think I think some of you guys are going to be I think a lot of you guys are going to be really excited
[14567.62s -> 14576.18s]  It there are multiple special guests by the way, and i'm very much looking forward to it. I can't wait
[14579.87s -> 14582.35s]  Uh, let's continue with the rest of this
[14582.91s -> 14585.47s]  I'll probably be live for another hour
[14585.47s -> 14591.84s]  or so
[14591.84s -> 14597.04s]  Uh, there's still a lot of work to be done on this project. I just was able to announce it today
[14597.84s -> 14602.38s]  Is it going to be a star studded event?
[14603.46s -> 14605.95s]  um
[14605.95s -> 14607.95s]  Yeah, I would say so
[14616.14s -> 14618.45s]  All right. What was I here? Okay. Here we go

[14680.78s -> 14682.78s]  No, come listen to my music
[14689.54s -> 14691.54s]  Hey, why don't we uh combine forces here?
[14693.52s -> 14694.64s]  You know this one
[14694.64s -> 14700.10s]  This is the part of the movie where the main character has sunglasses on and nails the piano and he goes
[14700.90s -> 14713.09s]  Who's calling me? Oh gig. It's gonna be a gig. It's gonna be a gig
[14714.98s -> 14717.82s]  It's the phone
[14717.82s -> 14719.66s]  It's the phone. It's gonna be a gig
[14719.66s -> 14724.93s]  There's a rock concert at the theater tonight featuring the screaming llamas
[14725.89s -> 14729.97s]  It might be in the best of interest with piano and piano to attend so they can learn from the best in the biz
[14730.93s -> 14735.55s]  Yes, where is it?
[14735.55s -> 14738.93s]  Okay, there it is rock star study at the movie cineplex

[14870.94s -> 14874.00s]  Listening to that song by radiohead. What's the name of that song?
[14874.56s -> 14879.31s]  What is it called? I put it was on repeat. I had that album
[14879.87s -> 14888.38s]  When I was younger, no, not creep. No, no, no the other one called like paranoid. What is it called?
[14888.94s -> 14897.42s]  Paranoid android that's the one I played paranoid android on repeat just jumping around in the backyard
[14906.83s -> 14908.59s]  That's that song was like
[14908.59s -> 14914.19s]  It reminded me of bohemian rhapsody. It's like four songs in one. I love that. I remember loving that song
[14924.27s -> 14926.27s]  The song slaps. Yeah, it does
[14926.43s -> 14934.93s]  All right, what time is it? All right 5 30. We gotta rest up. We got ready to play the gig
[14942.46s -> 14944.46s]  It slaps means it's really cool
[14945.04s -> 14949.12s]  I know what that means. I'm 35 not 80

[15081.26s -> 15083.26s]  My favorite band is the gorillas
[15083.84s -> 15087.76s]  Although I have not kept up very much with any of the newer stuff they've done over the last
[15088.64s -> 15090.64s]  I want to say like a year
[15090.64s -> 15099.41s]  a bit more than a year
[15099.41s -> 15101.97s]  Though honestly the last time I really kept up with the gorillas was
[15102.77s -> 15108.06s]  When humans came out that's pretty much it and why does my mic look like it's fucking low?
[15108.14s -> 15116.14s]  Hold on a second going on here. It looks low
[15116.62s -> 15119.50s]  Is this low to anybody else?
[15119.50s -> 15121.50s]  Am I better? Does that sound better?
[15122.06s -> 15126.16s]  That looked really low. Are we good now?
[15126.72s -> 15138.74s]  Why did that turn off? All right. Now that definitely looks like you can hear me better. You're missing the gig. Oh

[15219.49s -> 15221.25s]  Attend the rock concert
[15221.25s -> 15229.41s]  What's going on?
[15229.41s -> 15231.49s]  Don't have to play the song
[15231.49s -> 15234.69s]  Wait, i'm in the rock concert. Why would I attend the rock concert?

[15334.30s -> 15338.54s]  One star celebrity would be if I were to upload a picture like a video of auto

[17018.40s -> 17029.36s]  Really? That's so long to be working up three hours. I haven't been paying that much attention to rad but um, oh my god
[17029.76s -> 17046.83s]  Almost level eight athletic. I haven't even been paying attention play ads. Is it time for ads? All right while they sleep
[17046.99s -> 17050.85s]  It's time for ads
[17050.85s -> 17055.33s]  We're gonna be doing we're gonna do this now and then we're gonna do one more time at the end of the stream
[17055.41s -> 17067.01s]  So if you don't you can you know, uh, this would be the last time before this stream is over though. Let me uh run them
[17067.01s -> 17074.48s]  I'll be let's see you guys in two seconds. Those of you that are still here. I'll we'll be here save this though
[17074.72s -> 17085.14s]  Make sure it doesn't cause a problem. It's the first time i've seen chat cheer for ads
[17087.46s -> 17093.15s]  Uh, they used to do that but back in the day they did we used to run ads for fun. This is a joke
[17095.04s -> 17099.28s]  All right. I'll see you guys in in uh three minutes and then we'll do this one more time
[17100.00s -> 17119.28s]  At the end of the stream. See you in a minute three minutes to be exact end of the stream ads
[17121.38s -> 17125.54s]  Yeah, i'm gonna see how many i'm i've never done this before. I wonder how many I can actually run
[17126.18s -> 17137.12s]  Do five minutes. I don't think I can do more than a few minutes every hour or so
[17137.60s -> 17152.46s]  Whatever whatever, I don't know the exact timing you can do three minutes every five minutes
[17154.53s -> 17161.94s]  Well, that's the quickest way to destroy your entire career and make it so not any human being will ever watch your channel
[17162.74s -> 17174.56s]  ever for any reason
[17174.56s -> 17176.50s]  60 ads
[17176.50s -> 17189.47s]  Three minutes every five minutes. That's insane. I I would say
[17191.12s -> 17193.12s]  a couple minutes of advertising
[17195.38s -> 17197.02s]  is
[17197.02s -> 17199.18s]  Doesn't necessarily bother me as long as it's not
[17199.82s -> 17201.82s]  Like as long as i'm in control of it, right?
[17203.07s -> 17207.63s]  Like if I can tell you hey guys here comes an ad and it's like once like an hour or something
[17209.36s -> 17215.49s]  Like 30 40 50 minutes or so one thing that I hate more than anything
[17216.32s -> 17222.64s]  It's just ads that just just jump out at you a live platform like this. It's so awful
[17223.71s -> 17227.73s]  Just oh here we go. It's uh, we're in the middle of doing something
[17228.13s -> 17233.07s]  You're gone and this is my screen got 50% louder and I have no idea what I mean
[17233.39s -> 17240.32s]  I have no idea what i'm looking at anymore. So if I run ads
[17240.96s -> 17243.71s]  It'll be in scenarios like this
[17243.71s -> 17247.23s]  Where you know, they're coming, you know, they're coming for at least a full minute or so
[17247.97s -> 17250.91s]  And i'm still i'm not going to keep going
[17253.92s -> 17256.56s]  So there'll be ads on the streams that we do
[17257.68s -> 17261.68s]  And there's going to be a few people whose sole job it is to make sure that they're in a place
[17262.08s -> 17267.10s]  That's not going to cause any problems like content wise because that's a huge deal for me
[17267.10s -> 17271.49s]  I don't want people to miss anything. So we're going to find the right times to do those
[17274.06s -> 17279.58s]  there's no way that i'm going to want somebody to be in like two minutes of ads and something
[17280.22s -> 17290.62s]  Crazy is happening on the screen. No, and you should be back. Hello. Welcome back
[17291.95s -> 17293.95s]  Uh, that is the final time we're going to do that
[17295.01s -> 17298.05s]  I'm going to do it one more time at the very end of the stream before turning it off
[17302.08s -> 17307.92s]  Which i'll probably go for like another maybe like 20 30 minutes or so. I do want to see I want to conclude this arc here
[17312.77s -> 17314.77s]  Why did you start running ads in the first place? Well
[17316.34s -> 17317.78s]  I'd like to tell you
[17317.78s -> 17322.05s]  Uh, there's going to be three streams the dollhouse stream
[17322.45s -> 17325.33s]  Well, you will be able to control me as a viewer
[17325.89s -> 17328.53s]  We're doing the dollhouse thing that I talked about a couple years ago
[17329.38s -> 17338.43s]  Twitch has put forward a significant amount of money to partner with us to make this stream possible
[17339.52s -> 17342.08s]  And ads need to be ran on these streams
[17344.18s -> 17352.99s]  As part of our agreement here. I know people are going to go. Hey, he keeps saying he keeps saying
[17352.99s -> 17356.27s]  I got to make it really clear especially new people coming and going trickling in and out
[17356.59s -> 17359.47s]  There's a lot of info to have it's a huge amount of new information
[17360.24s -> 17363.12s]  And you will get more as the weeks go by the next week or two
[17363.12s -> 17376.38s]  You're going to get a ton more info. I'm very excited. Let's uh, let's let's finish this up though. So, uh
[17378.38s -> 17392.06s]  What I want to play a gig include the bugle arc today
[17392.70s -> 17398.08s]  The next time if I stream the if we do the sims again, let's say we do this next week
[17398.80s -> 17400.80s]  I think we're going to just do insane mods
[17403.20s -> 17405.36s]  It might be a mod shit show stream
[17405.84s -> 17411.60s]  Uh next week for sims 3
[17411.68s -> 17416.40s]  And then in a couple of days is the finale of the battleship tournament with lidwig
[17417.38s -> 17422.06s]  Same deal going to be over on his channel. We'll finish that up too this week
[17423.92s -> 17443.94s]  And why is this not going fast? Hurry up. Give rad his cemetery goth girlfriend already. I just like burped really loud
[17444.02s -> 17450.91s]  I hope the mic didn't pick it up
[17450.91s -> 17456.11s]  Grab a bowl of soup. Oh, oh, that's just mac and cheese. I kind of want mac and cheese right now
[17456.11s -> 17469.17s]  Why is there moss growing here? All right, everybody get up the whole household everybody
[17476.75s -> 17478.51s]  Mac and cheese sounds so good
[17478.51s -> 17487.54s]  I just like I want something. I'm hungry. What do I want if you were me? What would you eat right now?
[17496.96s -> 17500.08s]  He's still playing vanilla sims not as of next time
[17502.67s -> 17505.30s]  Yeah, let's talk. Okay. I got
[17505.46s -> 17508.82s]  Everything's just exploding. Can we fix this please?
[17517.17s -> 17519.33s]  Yeah, I will be hosting lidwig stream
[17520.05s -> 17524.50s]  Like we did last time
[17524.50s -> 17526.50s]  Anything else need to be fixed clean this up
[17531.54s -> 17552.16s]  Invite to cuddle. All right, should we should we try to make a baby out on bed cuddle on bed?
[17552.64s -> 17572.70s]  I thought that was the baby. I was like, why is the baby in this? What is going on? Who is this?
[17574.40s -> 17576.08s]  Jason bard
[17576.08s -> 17579.73s]  Who is this guy? What is he doing?
[17580.82s -> 17582.82s]  He's taking the sink
[17585.25s -> 17590.18s]  Who's this alien?

[19396.05s -> 19399.79s]  Ed room dining room
[19399.79s -> 19401.87s]  Oh kids room. Okay, right
[19406.64s -> 19427.94s]  um
[19427.94s -> 19429.54s]  bigger house
[19429.54s -> 19463.23s]  All right, put cello in the crib. There we go. Good
[19466.94s -> 19487.41s]  All right. We did it. You're gonna upload the 3am vid on your main channel. I don't probably not. Oh, it's rad's birthday. Right?
[19493.36s -> 19504.96s]  Uh, can I buy a cake or something? We're gonna get a cake
[19505.68s -> 19511.44s]  Yeah, what is up? I'm gonna buy you a car
[19517.70s -> 19521.30s]  Do you dislike the vibe of the folks from the old channel? Not at all
[19525.10s -> 19528.21s]  No, not at all. That's not even remotely
[19528.85s -> 19534.91s]  What I think
[19534.91s -> 19538.05s]  Yeah, why yeah, what do you mean?
[19538.05s -> 19540.13s]  All right, that's it. That's it. I'm done
[19541.26s -> 19543.90s]  I'll see you guys on thursday for the battleship tournament
[19544.62s -> 19546.62s]  I'll be in pre stream hanging out with you
[19546.94s -> 19549.47s]  I'll be in the chat room
[19549.47s -> 19554.69s]  Uh, i'm gonna run some more ads. I'm actually gonna i'm gonna do an experiment here. I'm curious
[19557.20s -> 19559.04s]  Let me see how
[19559.04s -> 19561.28s]  Let me see if I can do something once
[19563.78s -> 19565.38s]  All right, it's ad time
[19565.70s -> 19568.98s]  I will see you guys on thursday. Thanks for watching the sims 3 next time you see this is going to be
[19569.62s -> 19571.46s]  A shitload of mods on here and it's going to be hell
[19572.66s -> 19575.62s]  Uh, this stream was really just to kind of chill and
[19576.85s -> 19578.85s]  Announce that stream
[19579.09s -> 19580.53s]  Event week
[19580.53s -> 19582.53s]  I'm insanely excited for it
[19582.53s -> 19585.28s]  It's by far the biggest thing i've ever done
[19586.02s -> 19588.02s]  both logistically and
[19588.08s -> 19590.26s]  monetarily and
[19590.26s -> 19594.26s]  It should be a lot of fun regardless of if it goes to plan
[19594.66s -> 19598.18s]  We'll see but it's gonna be a lot of fun. I think it'll be at least worth watching
[19598.82s -> 19601.57s]  incredibly excited
[19601.57s -> 19605.09s]  So let's do some more ads and uh, we will call it here
[19605.73s -> 19610.98s]  Put that up. Let me save the game first very important
[19618.67s -> 19621.55s]  And we're gonna do three minutes if you're gonna take off and we'll see you again
[19622.11s -> 19624.08s]  I'll be back on
[19624.08s -> 19628.08s]  I will not be live on this channel, but I will be live on lidwigs like last time
[19628.72s -> 19632.56s]  And we'll see you later. See you in a couple days
[19632.80s -> 19635.47s]  Let me run the ads now
[19635.47s -> 19636.67s]  Let's try it again
[19636.67s -> 19655.55s]  Uh, let's do three minutes nearly 6 a.m. Where you are
[19657.02s -> 19662.85s]  Yeah, and thanks for watching too. I know that this was a little different of a stream kind of experimenting with
[19665.06s -> 19672.59s]  some ad content
[19672.59s -> 19674.59s]  I wonder if I can do it again
[19674.83s -> 19676.35s]  at the outro
[19676.35s -> 19682.85s]  Do we try is the dollhouse stream going to be your peak? No
[19684.30s -> 19689.90s]  No, there are things that I have planned that I want to do after the dollhouse stream that are going to be even more
[19690.88s -> 19692.93s]  ridiculous
[19692.93s -> 19697.90s]  One thing that I really want to do and I i'm not gonna give you a date for this but
[19699.81s -> 19704.70s]  Over the next year or so. I really really want to get done
[19705.55s -> 19709.31s]  Something i've been trying to do for years now and it will probably happen
[19710.61s -> 19713.89s]  Uh the germa rumble live on twitch actually live
[19715.33s -> 19717.33s]  That's what I really want to do next year
[19718.27s -> 19720.59s]  So once you start hearing me talk about that
[19721.07s -> 19724.61s]  At some point probably in 2022 is when I really want to get that off the ground
[19736.13s -> 19739.09s]  And in my 10 year on twitch tweet
[19740.50s -> 19744.74s]  I mentioned that I don't really know how much longer i'm going to be around on twitch for
[19745.22s -> 19747.60s]  I don't have a set date for it
[19747.60s -> 19753.20s]  but when you go over 10 years you start thinking about all the things that you really kind of want to do and
[19754.08s -> 19756.08s]  I would be very upset with myself
[19756.40s -> 19761.14s]  Years down the road if while I had the audience that is here right now
[19761.62s -> 19766.51s]  And while I had the means to do so that I didn't try over the next few years or so
[19767.55s -> 19774.18s]  At least the next few years to really try to get some of this stuff done that i've always really wanted to do
[19775.46s -> 19781.36s]  And really trying to just step on the gas as hard as I can. He's quitting
[19781.60s -> 19785.60s]  No, no, i'm just saying like look at the look at where this channel is now
[19787.74s -> 19791.90s]  I would be very upset with myself if I did not at least try to do something while
[19792.70s -> 19794.70s]  there's many of you here and
[19795.50s -> 19801.52s]  I'm it's insane to think about the amount of people that have come to this channel over the last year or two
[19803.02s -> 19805.82s]  Um, so I
[19805.90s -> 19814.43s]  I'm gonna keep doing stuff as long as i'm able to and as long as I want to go out on top
[19818.21s -> 19820.35s]  I don't have a plan to go out
[19820.35s -> 19826.56s]  My point i'm making is that I don't have a time period where I know how much longer i'm gonna do this for
[19826.96s -> 19828.96s]  But I know it's already been 10 years
[19829.65s -> 19831.62s]  so
[19831.62s -> 19834.98s]  While i'm at the level i'm at now both mentally
[19836.40s -> 19843.09s]  Even potentially physically trying to get healthier and stuff and while everybody's here and see I gotta step on the gas
[19843.09s -> 19851.81s]  We gotta go as hard as we can and let's see. I wonder can I do it again?
[19852.29s -> 19865.07s]  Yeah, should I can I do it again? Let me see here. I'm not gonna do it over the credits though
[19865.47s -> 19878.05s]  Don't push yourself too hard. No, i'm being very cautious of that as well because I still have a bunch of this medical bullshit
[19879.55s -> 19888.62s]  After the vr streams it's really clear again that i'm just not at 100% or even close but I can at least be
[19889.26s -> 19891.70s]  close enough with the
[19892.16s -> 19907.14s]  Therapeutic stuff and with time off and but it should be okay, but I am very very happy
[19907.14s -> 19908.26s]  I'm very excited
[19908.26s -> 19913.25s]  We're gonna try to want we're gonna try to run another three minutes of ads right at the very end here
[19915.66s -> 19925.55s]  See if I can do it. I'm curious. We're not going anywhere
[19930.16s -> 19932.85s]  I'm surprised
[19932.93s -> 19934.53s]  I'm very
[19934.53s -> 19936.77s]  Happy about that, but i'm surprised. It's been a long time
[19945.22s -> 19947.22s]  I actually got ads that time
[19949.31s -> 19954.93s]  Uh-oh, it's breaking through. We're actually we're infiltrating. We're getting through
[19955.33s -> 19961.66s]  But thanks for the subs. There was a lot there was
[19961.90s -> 19981.12s]  Somebody gave a shitload. Thank you. You can't believe I just found you
[19982.00s -> 19984.00s]  I'm not going anywhere. I'll be around
[19984.24s -> 19988.98s]  As long as i'm able to
[19988.98s -> 19990.98s]  There's still things that I need to do, right?
[19991.30s -> 19997.38s]  What's that? I'm like a ghost guys. I can't I cannot go away until I fulfill the reason why i'm here
[20000.45s -> 20003.65s]  I have the the germa rumble live on twitch
[20004.37s -> 20012.13s]  Has to happen that I can't I cannot go until I fulfill by destiny and then the next one after that and then the next one
[20012.21s -> 20015.25s]  I'm not I can't go anywhere. I'm i'm i'm the ghost that haunts your computer
[20017.22s -> 20021.94s]  All right. Let's see if I can do another three minutes. I after this three minutes is up. I will see you later
[20023.33s -> 20027.49s]  Thank you for watching again. We'll see you thursday for the battleship tournament. I'm in the semi finale
[20028.11s -> 20030.48s]  semi-final i believe versus
[20030.50s -> 20036.64s]  Stands I think we'll see i'm gonna try to run the ads again
[20037.12s -> 20044.11s]  And here we go the ad failed to run because the channel recently ran an ad
[20044.59s -> 20047.98s]  All right. Well, we can we're gonna wait one minute and 21 seconds
[20054.05s -> 20057.25s]  Really I got a big red marker just like excuse me
[20061.04s -> 20072.03s]  Yeah, we'll do it one more time
[20072.19s -> 20078.37s]  What time on thursday is the battleship thing? I think we're shooting for
[20079.17s -> 20080.85s]  2 pm pacific
[20080.85s -> 20086.85s]  On ludwig's channel and i'll i'll be i'll be around on thursday afternoon. So I'll let you guys know what's going on
[20087.65s -> 20093.02s]  Can I run it? Come on. I gotta run these ads
[20093.34s -> 20099.55s]  And there's one good thing. I guess
[20101.18s -> 20103.58s]  I think i'm turning pre-rolls off when I do this
[20106.85s -> 20107.73s]  or
[20107.73s -> 20109.73s]  At a pretty extended period of time
[20109.89s -> 20125.50s]  All right, let's see if I can run it three minutes
[20125.82s -> 20127.10s]  There it goes
[20127.10s -> 20131.18s]  All right. We got we currently have three minutes going. I didn't realize it was gonna do that
[20132.14s -> 20137.70s]  Pre-rolls are disabled. I keep like adding to my pre-roll disabled thing
[20159.62s -> 20161.62s]  Hippo happy. Well, thank you guys
[20173.78s -> 20189.30s]  two more minutes
[20189.30s -> 20191.30s]  The only stream that makes me laugh and cry
[20193.01s -> 20196.96s]  Well, come on comedy and tragedy. Those are the two masks
[20197.60s -> 20204.96s]  How to do them both
[20204.96s -> 20211.20s]  You're gonna do a mobile game stream that I actually was going to do I had like 70 mobile games on my ipad
[20212.90s -> 20213.78s]  but
[20213.78s -> 20215.78s]  It just sucked
[20215.78s -> 20218.34s]  And I tried to go through so many of them. I was gonna do a stream
[20218.98s -> 20225.06s]  And it was just they were terrible. They weren't even funny. They were loud. They were annoying half of them didn't work
[20226.72s -> 20229.52s]  Half of them were just menus and shit and it was like this is awful
[20232.18s -> 20234.18s]  I want to do that, but I definitely want to do
[20234.98s -> 20237.22s]  Because I feel like that would get kind of exhausting after a while
[20238.18s -> 20241.54s]  If we where we go 40 50 games deep on ipad
[20242.50s -> 20244.66s]  And just everyone's gonna everyone just wants to stop
[20245.30s -> 20248.66s]  It's like holy shit, man. I can't even take this anymore like an hour would go by and that would happen
[20257.73s -> 20260.77s]  Play a mobile game and jump into the game with ads. Yeah, you know actually
[20261.41s -> 20263.65s]  It was a recommendation a while ago that that was hilarious
[20264.53s -> 20266.53s]  And that was to open up my ipad
[20267.33s -> 20268.93s]  go to youtube
[20268.93s -> 20269.97s]  and just
[20269.97s -> 20272.37s]  Open up videos until I got a mobile ad
[20274.19s -> 20276.19s]  And then just download that game
[20276.91s -> 20279.87s]  And just just continue to download every ad that I get
[20280.51s -> 20284.22s]  Then I was like, that's probably a bad idea
[20284.22s -> 20288.51s]  Just go to every ad game
[20289.73s -> 20298.19s]  Ad jumping. Yeah
[20298.19s -> 20300.51s]  All right. I'll see you later. I'll see you in a couple days
[20301.23s -> 20305.44s]  Thanks for watching everybody. Hopefully this experiment went well
[20307.46s -> 20309.46s]  I will see you thursday
[20309.46s -> 20312.82s]  We have a lot more to talk about this other people involved that I need to
[20313.86s -> 20315.06s]  Tell you about
[20315.06s -> 20320.68s]  Have a great night. I will see you thursday
[20321.64s -> 20323.64s]  Bye take care
[20323.72s -> 20328.70s]  Have a great how about three more ads? Well, how about three more minutes of ads? No, I'm just kidding. I'll see you later
