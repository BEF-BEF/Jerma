[1.27s -> 7.66s]  I'll tell you, all of you that tell me that that taking the going to the bathroom the second way
[7.66s -> 14.12s]  takes less than 10 minutes. Nope. No, it does not. I don't know how the how you do that. How's it
[14.12s -> 21.77s]  possible? How do you take five? No, it does not. No way. I don't believe that person at all. It is
[21.77s -> 29.88s]  such it takes so much. You have to get in there. You have to get comfortable. That takes about 60
[29.88s -> 39.54s]  seconds. Then you have to be ready. If sometimes it's not all the way ready. That takes a good
[39.54s -> 51.21s]  solid minute or two for that to happen. Simply simply wiping your eye takes like at least a few
[51.21s -> 70.18s]  minutes. You can't say I can't say that. That's a bad word. And then after you're done, you have to
[70.18s -> 77.66s]  you sit there and contemplate the world for five minutes. That is the best place to decompress
[77.66s -> 84.38s]  all knowledge in your brain. You sit there and you die. You just you just take the world in for like
[84.38s -> 96.41s]  five to 10 minutes. If I don't get my decompress the world time, I did not go number two. If I
[96.41s -> 103.82s]  don't get that five minutes of like opening up a Twitter thread and judging every single person
[103.82s -> 108.87s]  in it. If I don't get that five minutes on the toilet, I'm sorry. I did not go number two.
[116.10s -> 131.56s]  Are you even potty trained? Imagine like I don't I have one of those like little toilets with little
[131.56s -> 142.41s]  kids. Remember why is there no plumbing installed in your house? I don't I don't know what I don't
[142.41s -> 160.92s]  know why. I don't know what that is. Not potty trained. You're gonna love them. A tweet? Oh shit
[160.92s -> 164.84s]  you're right tweet. Anyways the the reason people saying why you're talking about this. This is why
[164.84s -> 172.87s]  the stream is 20 minutes late. What's that um Newton's third law of aerodynamics? Anything that
[172.87s -> 183.00s]  can go wrong will go wrong. Somebody somebody made that up. That's somebody's law. Murphy's law. Okay
[183.00s -> 189.58s]  yeah right. Like Otto had to go to the bathroom. I had to go to the bathroom. I was hearing a weird
[189.58s -> 195.42s]  noise. I had to like investigate the noise. I need to water my I have plant. I need to water my plant.
[196.06s -> 215.19s]  When is the McDickie game night? Soon but not next week or the week after. All right so let's
[215.19s -> 221.24s]  uh here's his plan. Let me tell you what's going on here. Hello welcome back by the way. What kind
[221.24s -> 227.61s]  of plant? It's a money tree because it's like I think it's a cool looking it's a it's a little
[227.61s -> 233.58s]  money tree. It's a braided money tree and um if you have one of those in your house then you get
[233.58s -> 238.22s]  you you get to be you're a millionaire. You get to be a millionaire right? I water it every day and
[238.22s -> 241.82s]  I fucking make sure it's completely healthy and I put it in the exact spot it wants to be in in the
[241.82s -> 250.26s]  sun. Except here's the funny thing about a money tree. I believe you're supposed to be gifted a
[250.26s -> 254.82s]  money tree. I don't think you're supposed to just buy one and hope to be a millionaire. Like it's
[254.82s -> 261.69s]  not a scratch ticket. I like I don't know that's not accurate. I believe you suppose you're supposed
[261.69s -> 271.66s]  to be gifted one. You don't just buy one like a fucking lottery ticket. No I like plants now. I'm
[271.66s -> 279.35s]  a plant person now okay. I've got like three plants in my place and I take very good care of them
[279.35s -> 287.67s]  and they have names too Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Let me tell you Louie is quite the troublemaker.
[288.31s -> 339.11s]  He's quite a troublemaker. All right let me I'll be right back. Let me tweet. I didn't even tweet.
[339.11s -> 347.67s]  I'll tweet right now. Oh by the way the people asking about the title. Okay the reason why the
[347.67s -> 357.62s]  title is the way it is is because think of every pawn tv show or media. It's always about like porn.
[359.29s -> 370.06s]  Hardcore pawn. Okay pawn stars. Pawn. Porn. So I figured that you know the generation the zoomers
[370.06s -> 377.98s]  and the millennials will understand this one. And coming up next on enough pawn tabs to crash my
[377.98s -> 397.40s]  computer. They're gonna buy a helicopter. Will they? Oh you guys are pretty torn on this title.
[397.40s -> 409.14s]  I'm not sure. I don't know how to how to gauge it. Stop with the plus twos chat. It was clearly a
[409.14s -> 416.20s]  minus two. Oh you guys can debate that for a little while. Okay all right it's a pawn game.
[416.20s -> 420.44s]  It looks really fun. It looks really engaging. It looks really interesting. So we're gonna play it.
[420.44s -> 428.63s]  What am I talking about? Have you not seen any pawn tv show? They're all porn references.
[429.59s -> 440.36s]  Hardcore pawn and pawn stars. What are you talking about? How dare you? Okay pawn shop game.
[441.42s -> 457.91s]  Here's the twitter. Here's the twitter. Okay I know I can set this to be auto tweet but I don't
[457.91s -> 466.55s]  want to connect my twitch to anything. It always freaks me out. All right tweet is out. We can get
[466.55s -> 477.83s]  started here in a sec. The creative technology. I don't know. I just don't like connecting everything.
[478.39s -> 485.19s]  You're making this up. What am I? All right now I'm just being.
[486.15s -> 494.41s]  Hold on a second. My laundry is almost done. I just went into spin cycle. I'm just trying to
[494.41s -> 506.33s]  play a game here man. What's that? Popcorn? Yeah I got a popcorn machine right here. Are you angry?
[506.33s -> 510.25s]  I'm not angry. I got like a frog in my throat today though so you can hear a lot of like
[512.01s -> 520.22s]  mutes like that. I got this like annoying frog. It won't go away. All right let's go. I think
[520.22s -> 539.77s]  we're ready. Aren't we? I think so. This is called no umbrellas allowed and I'm very excited. Do a
[539.77s -> 544.25s]  ribbit. Oh speaking of ribbits. I got a quick story for you. It's really really small. You know
[544.25s -> 549.37s]  when you do one of those burps that's an internal burp. It's almost like a frog burp where your
[549.37s -> 556.50s]  stomach goes like and it comes back down really fast. So I had my iPad on my. I have like a
[556.50s -> 563.27s]  little thing that holds my iPad and it just sits in this little tray and I put that on my stomach
[563.27s -> 567.83s]  and it's like it has like a keyboard too. So it's like a little like half fake laptop little thing
[569.03s -> 573.03s]  and I did one of those. I was just sitting there with my arms behind my head watching like a YouTube
[573.03s -> 578.30s]  video and I went like and the thing bounced up like I like somebody was on a trampoline
[578.30s -> 586.34s]  and it almost hit me right in the face. It was it was scary. It bounced like and hit like almost
[586.34s -> 595.37s]  hit me right in the like bottom lip. It was terrifying. All right we're gonna play a new game.
[597.59s -> 613.51s]  2080 Ajik City. My throat is annoying. It was a cool story. I told you it wasn't even a story.
[614.15s -> 618.28s]  Last night there was a massive explosion at the Citizens Alliance Research Institute,
[618.28s -> 626.81s]  a central bunker district. Due to the explosion most of the artificial rain tech files and the
[626.81s -> 633.35s]  fixer manufacturing facilities are all gone. Get some water. I've been drinking water all morning.
[633.91s -> 637.35s]  I had a big salad too. I had a whole. I almost ate an entire avocado today. Hopefully I don't
[637.35s -> 643.19s]  shit my pants. The government and the Association of Victims of Avarice Crimes have announced that
[643.19s -> 650.49s]  they need at least eight more weeks to resume the fixerian project. Now Ajik City, the last city
[650.49s -> 674.63s]  waiting for the fix rain, is to stay dry for a few more weeks. Hey are you dead? Please help me.
[674.63s -> 682.42s]  Shush. An AVAC guy is coming. Hey Cheb thanks for the 25 community subs. Listen to me. What the
[682.42s -> 692.15s]  fuck? This is dalping joe from whatever it was. Oh look at the night sky. More beautiful than ever
[692.15s -> 698.22s]  isn't it? Thanks for the subs though. That's a lot of subs. 25. What's wrong with him? Is he injured?
[698.22s -> 708.44s]  Is he from the institute? No this is my son. He's got weak legs since he was a child. It's typical.
[708.44s -> 714.78s]  Don't worry. Do you need any help? No everything's fine. As long as every character is over the age
[714.78s -> 730.89s]  of 70 today I'll be able to be fine. Lucky me you fit the profile.
[737.02s -> 748.60s]  Pudding throat. I know I'm trying to work on it. Hey you're here. The doctor said your face got the
[748.60s -> 756.46s]  most injuries so he covered your whole face with bandages. You can take them off after a week but
[756.46s -> 767.78s]  he's not sure your face will be the same as it was before. Ah I'm Darcy just an old-timer who owns a
[767.78s -> 776.47s]  second-hand shop nearby. Oh here it comes. And from this moment you'll be my son Bob. I know

[781.43s -> 788.84s]  the accident. So after you get back on your feet you should manage my store pretending you're my

[970.39s -> 976.09s]  it works like you have some type of telepathic ability to tell when I'm going to tell a joke
[978.82s -> 983.21s]  this does look like pickle rick though it does looks like double pickle rick I'm surprised I
[983.21s -> 986.65s]  didn't met all right that person was right I don't know how you did that but like fuck off

[1024.73s -> 1034.44s]  mitigation treatment center go to lower floor where am I supposed to go a depth hold on
[1034.44s -> 1044.89s]  come to Darcy's it's on level b1 podopolis sing sing side oh I gotta go down there it is okay
[1044.89s -> 1057.19s]  this Darcy's never seen the floaty around we've had a comedy recession and we didn't take a look
[1057.19s -> 1061.51s]  at the log all right so we have to go to work this is Darcy's here so here's like the different
[1062.31s -> 1072.38s]  let's go I'm Hugh people call me the sphinx of Darcy's and you are you look much better now
[1072.38s -> 1077.98s]  welcome to Darcy's the secondhand shop I've been running this place for more than 30 years
[1077.98s -> 1085.54s]  as I told you you are now my son Bob who will inherit this store from me that is why I picked
[1085.54s -> 1091.22s]  you up from the beach AVAC's been pestering me about what it is whereabouts and I needed to
[1091.22s -> 1098.98s]  stand in for Bob yeah after all that time now they're looking for Bob oh but Darcy what if
[1098.98s -> 1105.40s]  Bob comes back out of the blue that is not gonna happen it's almost a decade since he left by the
[1105.40s -> 1112.73s]  way this one here is Hugh it's got a mouth on it but it will be of help anyways now let's start
[1112.73s -> 1120.09s]  discussing what you're gonna do here at here you're going to both buy and sell things and you must
[1120.09s -> 1124.92s]  stay alert at all times every customer wants to get paid more money that's because this place
[1124.92s -> 1132.09s]  is off the grid from the citizen discourse data radar can I go home what the fuck is this I did
[1132.09s -> 1136.90s]  that so I don't have to care about what the AVAC is doing in here there are side effects just like
[1136.90s -> 1143.80s]  Hugh said customers all get so cocky as soon as they get in here anyway for today I'll teach you
[1143.80s -> 1149.69s]  how to negotiate price when buying things that's where to start when buying things it's really
[1149.69s -> 1155.99s]  important to find a balance it has to be a price that the customer can accept and that can still
[1155.99s -> 1163.69s]  make you a profit when resold they can't just start yelling out prices why not you must praise
[1163.69s -> 1171.38s]  the item first when it comes to appraising things I use cards do the voice fuck customers
[1171.38s -> 1180.74s]  introduce their items with cards gray card is base information base price it's a cup if without a
[1180.74s -> 1187.58s]  lack of fins or a long tongue okay it's a cup a green card is detailed information and changes
[1187.58s -> 1196.41s]  in price so I get detailed info from like so there's different rarities so if it's a green
[1196.41s -> 1203.54s]  card it's like okay this is could be the prices could be changed a lot here oh I forgot the blue
[1203.54s -> 1209.30s]  cards green cards include object objective information on the other hand blue cards are
[1209.30s -> 1217.85s]  close to opinions just like how damaged how popular or rare an item is so this is people
[1217.85s -> 1222.65s]  come in they go hey you die this is this is worth like fucking 50 bucks and it's worth like 30
[1222.65s -> 1234.90s]  sharing blue cards are like sharing your opinion at which customers may protest or get mad okay
[1234.90s -> 1240.10s]  card slot what the fuck is this to share a card with a customer you must insert the card in the
[1240.10s -> 1247.30s]  card slot combination of cards yields a price you can use it as a guideline while bargaining
[1247.30s -> 1254.50s]  all right so I have like the combination is the price of the of the actual item is it a card it's
[1254.50s -> 1261.94s]  not a card game don't worry about too much about colors for now focus on bargaining the price based
[1261.94s -> 1270.09s]  on the cards here the gray card for this bag says bag bags are usually sold for 100 vannas let's
[1270.09s -> 1275.21s]  say brand a is pretty high end which means the price goes up by 200 v bucks whatever I don't
[1275.21s -> 1280.25s]  care minus two me cowhide means adding an extra 50 v bucks to them and finally the price went down
[1280.25s -> 1285.59s]  by 20 percent is just slightly damaged now you can start bargaining based on the price these
[1285.59s -> 1293.37s]  cards have set and you see 280 v below the card slots that's the guideline you can suggest 280
[1293.37s -> 1300.54s]  from the start if you want to go easy you want to make a profit you better cut it at least one third
[1300.54s -> 1309.50s]  jesus decide how much to offer at first offer less than 70 percent of the guideline make an offer use
[1309.50s -> 1314.65s]  the calculator to set its buying price and press offer say yes or no to a customer's offer to say
[1314.65s -> 1323.00s]  yes press accept if no insert a new number and press offer fuck we have to do math so since this
[1323.00s -> 1330.22s]  is your first offer you can be a little bolder use the calculator on your own and try okay so
[1330.22s -> 1338.09s]  this is a bag just a regular bag it's damaged but it's from a decent brand and it's made of a cowhide
[1338.09s -> 1344.87s]  I'll give you let me do the thing that they do in pawn stars first of all he goes
[1345.03s -> 1345.53s]  okay
[1347.27s -> 1353.96s]  ah the best i can do is 40 bucks and the guy comes in wanting like 500 he laughs again really loud
[1353.96s -> 1363.42s]  okay so let's just should we do 40 dollars all right so let's just i'll give you i'll give you
[1363.42s -> 1371.61s]  150 bucks for it about 150 no this time we do as i said 190 what what no you tell me whatever
[1372.17s -> 1380.25s]  the best i can all right man the best i can do is 190 good but mostly customers won't accept
[1380.25s -> 1385.58s]  your first offer instead they will make a counter offer like this about 240
[1388.52s -> 1392.44s]  now man i'm telling you i i gotta put this on the shelf i don't know who's gonna buy this
[1392.44s -> 1396.60s]  i don't know who's gonna come in here looking for one of these am i just on the shelf for a year
[1396.60s -> 1414.49s]  i don't know that's 210 some well all right i yeah let me call my buddy he knows more about
[1414.49s -> 1426.12s]  ancient artifacts than i do i came to realize that i that's that's rick wait are you want me
[1426.12s -> 1433.27s]  1500 bucks wait a minute i just missed a huge huge huge fucking part of this i'll take 115
[1433.27s -> 1437.75s]  v what's going on not a good strategy leave your debt unpaid for long he just turned into like an
[1437.75s -> 1446.42s]  evil character what happened and it's not just the debt that you should make money for if you
[1446.42s -> 1451.61s]  don't save money you won't be treated as a human being after you become a fixie strictly speaking
[1451.61s -> 1456.63s]  they are not human beings anyway to be treated in a fair way even after you get fixed you have
[1456.63s -> 1465.43s]  to join the fixie pension plan to join it uh i forgot again the silly requirements just so we're
[1465.43s -> 1470.38s]  clear it's not because he's old it's because there was more than one as far as i remember you join
[1470.38s -> 1477.82s]  it by paying 10 000 v or was it 30 000 v let you know the details next time making some money is
[1477.82s -> 1483.98s]  the first thing to do anyways don't say anything you shouldn't when avac avac shows up just don't

[1985.18s -> 1991.75s]  someone to act whoever set that place on fire i'm fully behind them next up professor yang ji
[1991.75s -> 1998.46s]  choy is staging a one-man protest against avac he argues that the lack of clear standards for
[1998.46s -> 2006.20s]  what are and are not avarice crimes will cause huge confusion he also claims avac is interpreting
[2006.20s -> 2013.38s]  the law however they please leading to the incarceration of innocent citizens i respect
[2013.38s -> 2019.10s]  his courage but don't think you don't think he's all talk why can't he do something real like that

[3393.78s -> 3401.34s]  in town hue bob up ah that was great citizens of agic city good morning from the association of
[3401.34s -> 3406.89s]  victims of crimes they cut me off have a restrained and greed free day thank you
[3410.97s -> 3414.73s]  you haven't run away yet now it's time for me to teach you how to check materials and damage
[3414.73s -> 3421.42s]  levels let's look at that bag from yesterday i said that this bag is in perfect condition but
[3421.42s -> 3428.22s]  before moving on to the next step you should check for yourself by using a tool praising an item oh
[3428.22s -> 3435.26s]  here we go customers sometimes lie means you have to check each card carefully they show you
[3435.77s -> 3442.38s]  scrutinize an item use the tools in the manual oh boy insert cards from the manual pull out
[3442.38s -> 3447.72s]  cards and insert them into the card slot if you're wrong customers mostly turn it down
[3447.72s -> 3456.90s]  what a slurp i'm fine here's the toolbox click the damage assessor and move it onto the bag
[3456.90s -> 3463.59s]  it's in the second slot holy shit this is gonna get well isn't gonna get wacky here are the two
[3463.59s -> 3469.66s]  essential tools damage assessor and material magnifier this measures damage level and this
[3469.66s -> 3484.09s]  shows what texture it actually is okay so you're saying that this is it's not really
[3484.09s -> 3489.69s]  perfect right and let's move on to its material click the material magnifier and move it onto
[3489.69s -> 3495.85s]  the bag wait so the happy face means perfect this is what a stupid meter this is a baby toy
[3495.85s -> 3506.60s]  i'm gonna look like an idiot you see its material up close but you can't tell what exactly it is
[3506.60s -> 3518.39s]  for now that's what you need this manual for oh my god the manual complements your knowledge
[3518.39s -> 3523.98s]  and expertise you use keyboard shortcuts to navigate efficiently lets you move to each page
[3523.98s -> 3531.58s]  right this is where you pull out cards from in the manual okay in the text page what are the
[3531.58s -> 3535.98s]  manual list in the manual okay the material list find out which material looks closest to what
[3535.98s -> 3541.62s]  you just saw drag the one you found from the list of the slot you'll be pulling out a card
[3541.62s -> 3554.60s]  and putting it in the slot it's this one yeah it's this one cowhide oh leather cowhide but
[3554.60s -> 3561.34s]  now that's what's worth more money it's cowhide that's it did you see the card and the price change
[3561.42s -> 3565.66s]  next let's head to the condition page from the manual list use the damage assessor again and
[3565.66s -> 3576.07s]  decide which damage level it falls into this would be i would say this would be slightly damaged
[3576.07s -> 3587.16s]  this is slightly damaged it's not perfect condition ooh cards in the slot are tagged to items and
[3587.16s -> 3594.38s]  shared with customers as you put things on the showcase oh to let customers know this item is
[3594.38s -> 3602.14s]  worth this much cards have to be accurate and concrete to earn trust of customers and with
[3602.14s -> 3608.55s]  trust you will be able to sell more so keep in mind to use the tools in the manual there's one
[3608.55s -> 3614.86s]  more once a customer accepts a card you can't undo it which means you cannot remove or replace
[3614.86s -> 3619.34s]  cards once the deal is closed so don't lose focus during an appraisal it's the only chance you can
[3619.34s -> 3624.60s]  decide which card to tag onto an item this is one last thing you have to keep in mind during
[3624.60s -> 3634.60s]  appraisal okay reputational card too this card gives you more advantages as your appraising skill
[3634.60s -> 3639.48s]  improves customers will begin to buy items appraised by us without any doubt or even paying
[3639.48s -> 3645.34s]  more it's a reputation scam everyone will only scam some people i can't say we're gonna scam
[3645.34s -> 3650.62s]  everybody but we'll scam whoever we need to it doesn't show up from the beginning but
[3650.62s -> 3655.10s]  right after appraising and purchasing so it's automatically attached to items after you appraise
[3655.10s -> 3663.40s]  so i have to get that skill up you already mentioned the card wittiness of darcy's right
[3663.40s -> 3670.52s]  oops these three cards indicate our store's reputation from three different views these
[3670.52s -> 3675.74s]  are special because they improve themselves along with you better you get the more effective each
[3675.74s -> 3680.76s]  card will be by driving the bargain to your advantage or encouraging customers to buy each
[3680.76s -> 3686.78s]  card shows its detailed effects sick you can check the effects and the progressions of each
[3686.78s -> 3696.10s]  card here all right i'm ready for day two it's one oh just one last thing i feel like i'm this is e3
[3696.10s -> 3702.28s]  it'll be beyond your capacity for now so i'll let you know about it later it's a 10 second trailer
[3702.28s -> 3708.25s]  for elden ring for now focus on improving your recommending skills okay the abc must have scared
[3708.25s -> 3715.00s]  you back then don't worry i took care of it they wanted you to either pay the fine or get fixed
[3715.00s -> 3719.11s]  might sound like they've given you a chance to make a choice but they're not the amount of
[3719.11s -> 3723.91s]  fines is ridiculous and most people can't afford to pay it avac wants nothing but to make more
[3723.91s -> 3728.57s]  fixies so try not to give them an excuse to get you and please forgive my granddaughter she may
[3728.57s -> 3733.61s]  look a bit selfish but she's just a poor kid both her father and her uncle left town when she was
[3733.61s -> 3738.33s]  so young moreover her father's now a fixie you can't imagine what she's going through

[4753.21s -> 4757.69s]  this kind of rain you see people sprinting around and panicking but it's already over
[4758.57s -> 4764.09s]  if you stand in this for more than five seconds it's over already you might as well just walk

[4784.90s -> 4789.77s]  does is just makes it hit you in the eyes because if you run really fast you're giving yourself

[5555.69s -> 5560.33s]  becoming an artist even in a situation like this without adac both nari and her father would have
[5560.33s -> 5564.65s]  been following their dream by now i could do anything for nari to let her enter the bunker
[5564.65s -> 5570.62s]  so she won't get fixed as her father did harry's dad took off to haga city a few years ago saying
[5570.62s -> 5576.46s]  he'd become a great painter haga city is where artists used to live in groups but you know fixed

[5646.01s -> 5650.25s]  allowed to use an umbrella i was fully exposed to the rain that's why i caught a cold he also
[5650.25s -> 5655.13s]  said i asked the association of victims of adverse crimes if they could let the elderly in the week
[5655.13s -> 5660.41s]  use umbrellas the association however is not responding yet to his request this is reporter

[5860.52s -> 5864.84s]  so i can't sell it for what it's actually worth because i cannot appraise it if i lie
[5866.10s -> 5876.39s]  i can't repraise can't appraise it again so i either sell it for like 400 i'm talking back here
[5876.39s -> 5906.42s]  it's made of platinum all right what do you want for it how about uh i'll give you 250 as a thank

[5919.13s -> 5926.44s]  stabilizer is going to be here soon he thinks actual bob came back from bluebird so he'll get
[5926.44s -> 5931.56s]  you to take emotion mitigation treatment emotion mitigation treatment basically suppresses your
[5931.56s -> 5937.67s]  emotions it's so expensive that you may feel you might as well become a fixie the reasons why some
[5937.67s -> 5942.39s]  people desperately wait for fixed rain anyhow taking that treatment won't do any good for you
[5943.43s -> 5947.99s]  to tell the truth it's pretty easy to avoid it you have to tell yourself you're a fixie and
[5947.99s -> 5957.34s]  suppress all your emotions simply put just act like a fixie as best you can oh you know what
[5957.34s -> 5967.75s]  i'm gonna say here it comes oh you can always tell because i go oh what about fixer his brain
[5967.75s -> 5974.34s]  must have been so messed up fixer is a drug to erase human emotions and desires people who got
[5974.34s -> 5981.26s]  fixed are fixies people who haven't are called floaties fixies are nothing but the dead who still
[5981.26s -> 5986.38s]  breathe they're unresponsive to whatever happens around them even when their house gets robbed
[5986.38s -> 5990.38s]  or when the avc takes away their family right before their very eyes they just stand there
[5990.38s -> 5996.15s]  and watch no anger no sadness no desire nothing almost every citizen living in this country
[5997.19s -> 6003.43s]  mindlessia is already a fixie except for those in this city it's because a year ago the association
[6003.43s -> 6010.14s]  of victims of avers rained fixer all over the country except agic city we were lucky because
[6010.14s -> 6015.10s]  the citizens of alliance and research institute exploded a few weeks ago that's how we became the
[6015.10s -> 6022.07s]  last floaties in the whole country anyhow the stabilizer comes pretend you're an emotionless
[6022.07s -> 6028.22s]  zombie and please don't say you don't know what zombie is even if he offends you or acts nice to
[6028.22s -> 6033.51s]  you don't move a muscle there'll be only two choices left floaties who can't hide their emotions
[6033.51s -> 6038.39s]  in front of stabilizers either get emotion mitigation treatment be labeled an avarice
[6038.39s -> 6043.42s]  criminal i've seen countless people going bankrupt trying to afford emotion mitigation treatment
[6044.46s -> 6049.98s]  once you're labeled as one of these criminals otherwise the avc will arrest you and fix you
[6050.78s -> 6055.61s]  so never let the stabilizer get to you how will i know who the stabilizer is did he say i'm the
[6055.61s -> 6063.43s]  stabilizer i got more shit to put on the shelves hold on common silver bracelet oh yeah how much

[6188.55s -> 6192.87s]  friend jisu was such a good person and really smart too he even got a job in the citizens
[6192.87s -> 6199.13s]  alliance research institute but i heard he had a hard time there while doing all sorts of
[6199.13s -> 6203.69s]  experiments on floaties and fixies must have been really painful for him to watch the experiments
[6203.69s -> 6210.20s]  killing people and driving them crazy by the way here's a mars rock this one's worth five
[6210.20s -> 6214.36s]  grand anyways it was jisu that i was looking for but after the fire in the institute he's
[6214.36s -> 6222.90s]  gone missing however i will do anything to find him i'm sure he's still alive anyway it was great
[6222.90s -> 6232.22s]  to see you again take care then and stopping by i thought she was hitting on you um well thanks
[6232.22s -> 6242.46s]  for coming by are you darcy's son who came back in town oh this is the stabilizer he's from the
[6242.46s -> 6248.70s]  fair treaded commission and his roles to prevent and settle down the chaos of the city according
[6248.70s -> 6254.60s]  to the citizen discourse data stabilizers usually create even more chaos knock it off i'm not like
[6254.60s -> 6260.78s]  those idiots nothing none of them can pick on floaties as skillfully as i do oh so you're proud
[6260.78s -> 6269.30s]  of it by the way why do you have your face wrapped up like that is that a problem of course i just
[6269.30s -> 6274.58s]  see the face to decide whether he needs emotion mitigation treatment or not maybe i can put him
[6274.58s -> 6282.52s]  under intensive care he's been in bluebird for a decade huh and the bell is on you shut up time
[6282.52s -> 6287.64s]  to see how good your master is at restraining his emotions you better be completely honest question
[6287.64s -> 6299.50s]  number one if i say i need tons of money right now are you going to ask me why no don't be serious
[6299.50s -> 6306.63s]  it's just a test now if i say i need a hundred dollars from you are you going to give me that
[6306.63s -> 6315.16s]  no don't need to be so serious i don't need your pocket money let's just stop this shit i can take
[6315.16s -> 6325.38s]  you straight to abac and give you a dose of fixer sure is that an easy decision for you
[6325.38s -> 6336.20s]  wacko are you upset now no but your voice is telling me different here take this money and

[6346.54s -> 6354.31s]  for me forget about your father and just follow my orders uh what's what's emotionless yes
[6355.91s -> 6365.85s]  right that's what that is no would be like no yes you're just a yes man you just want me to leave
[6367.14s -> 6375.03s]  no yes i don't know should i say yes i do want him to leave but but isn't saying no like no don't go
[6375.03s -> 6381.27s]  yes i want you to leave but is yes more emotional like i want you to get out of here because you're
[6381.27s -> 6386.15s]  annoying or no i want to keep you here because i'm like i like this conversation too much which
[6386.15s -> 6403.48s]  one is correct yes implies want yes is more emotional no no here's your result there were
[6403.48s -> 6409.06s]  some points your emotion level exceeded the limit but i'll cut you some slack for now they don't
[6409.06s -> 6415.85s]  want to give up this fun too soon how evil but i will keep watching you remember i'm always ready
[6415.85s -> 6425.11s]  to put you in the treatment process fast you're not a good actor by the way to look like a fixer
[6425.11s -> 6429.59s]  you have to loosen up and act like a zombie that dull face of yours right now is what you really
[6429.59s -> 6444.65s]  needed earlier uh hi uh could you buy this off me you look very kind by the way not like darcy

[6930.02s -> 6935.72s]  in 2022 yeah i know because the last like four games they've made have been absolute fucking
[6935.72s -> 6939.94s]  ass that makes sense as to why they wouldn't want to do it again spend some more time on it
[6939.94s -> 6947.37s]  stop just releasing fucking bloated shitty roster updates and nobody cares about did you get the
[6947.37s -> 6954.82s]  year estimator back bunch of brought it yesterday but it was way past the due date anyhow it's
[6954.82s -> 6962.55s]  time to learn how to read the chronological table toy car put the year estimator and put it on this
[6962.55s -> 6974.33s]  toy the second slot to the right okay 2062 good the number 2062 you just saw is the exact year
[6974.33s -> 6981.69s]  the toy was created items that are related to historical events are worth a lot more
[6981.69s -> 6989.34s]  so this is the year list of historical events in that year and then pull up the card national
[6989.34s -> 7003.02s]  historical value huh okay let's try it so this is the chronological table it should be a historical
[7003.02s -> 7015.85s]  event in the year 2062 uh 2062 the recovery period but the year isn't all that counts
[7015.85s -> 7024.73s]  take a look this toy isn't really related to the historical event that happened in 2062
[7024.73s -> 7031.35s]  vroom vroom car fair trade fair trade commission this was also produced in 2062 take a look at the
[7031.35s -> 7038.17s]  news article the beginning of a new era let's start together and run together says the president the
[7038.17s -> 7041.80s]  government is planning to build a fair trade commission this one seems to be related to the
[7041.80s -> 7051.27s]  event in 2062 okay then you can appreciate its historical value bald what why are you writing
[7051.27s -> 7058.89s]  that of all like bald yeah the guy we have been playing for two hours that you can write that now
[7058.89s -> 7075.77s]  all right national historical value times two this has historical value and i don't have any
[7075.77s -> 7080.41s]  of those at the moment but those made before the 21st century century will also come in
[7080.41s -> 7086.28s]  in that case you can appreciate its archaeological value those who collect and research things lost
[7086.28s -> 7092.63s]  during the war and the flood in 2000 will go crazy for it so it's for your own good to use that card
[7092.63s -> 7097.08s]  collectors even visit us to buy historical archaeological items and their budget is
[7097.08s -> 7105.21s]  relatively high but it's also a good idea to wait for them looking for a higher margin by the way
[7105.21s -> 7109.86s]  the signature detector is still in repair so i'll give it to you tomorrow see you then this is
[7109.86s -> 7118.62s]  turning into like papers please but i like this game this is cool i like to buy the blue bird
[7118.62s -> 7135.78s]  ocarina over there how much is it that'll be that's too much for this how about 60 basher where were

[7162.47s -> 7169.38s]  really honestly i really thought it was a fake that thing was collecting dust in our attic for

[7264.94s -> 7273.72s]  whatever hey take a look at this the wanted poster this should have some national historical value
[7273.72s -> 7284.39s]  first of all lady wait a minute this made out of fucking solid diamond paper okay it's not in
[7284.39s -> 7288.79s]  perfect condition so i have to dock you a little bit of points on that one it's slightly damaged
[7288.79s -> 7297.72s]  slightly damaged uh in fact it's potential garbage uh all right let's take a look what
[7297.72s -> 7309.64s]  year was this uh 2036 we got in the year 2036 there is no historical value here 2036 sorry

[7390.65s -> 7401.00s]  were any significant events that happened in 2036 you're so fussy and it won't be worth anything
[7401.08s -> 7409.35s]  right i won't sell it then well then leave i think it wasn't worth anything anyway good job bob i
[7409.35s -> 7426.20s]  offered money look how do you think i knew it'd be breathtaking to you i bought this so that you

[8624.81s -> 8636.22s]  considered very common okay this is very common so he used to write highly objective articles
[8636.22s -> 8641.88s]  that people thought he equipped himself with a potato chip you see the list of types on the
[8641.88s -> 8645.64s]  page i showed you earlier yeah okay so this is a common this is a this is like if it's this one

[8721.11s -> 8735.14s]  tutorial if an autograph detected by the tool doesn't exist on the list or looks different
[8735.14s -> 8740.92s]  you can use the card unidentified or fake autograph please remember even a slight
[8740.92s -> 8744.84s]  difference in a stroke can make an autograph unidentifiable okay well it's gonna get weird
[8744.84s -> 8751.16s]  you would even have to look at the curves or surfs when it is cleverly forged i can't speak
[8751.16s -> 8757.75s]  there's one more thing the signature's list won't help when it comes to the type of great
[8757.75s -> 8765.18s]  figure in world history you know i couldn't add every famous historical person to that list
[8765.18s -> 8771.99s]  and most of their belongings have a certificate so when you want to use the card great figure

[10073.08s -> 10080.36s]  eyes than me all right what's this made out of like wavy this is made out of wiki tanness tree
[10082.23s -> 10091.11s]  a brand that is so unpopular that even avac won't give a dang about it who do i run the store do you
[10091.11s -> 10101.83s]  sometimes even leave out its slogan because all the hold on you're talking too fast so what
[10101.83s -> 10109.51s]  it means you have to check one more thing while appraising bob it's brand boy brand of an item
[10109.51s -> 10115.24s]  is a critical factor in the items price uh click each brand logo to read its details this that's
[10115.24s -> 10124.31s]  screwed a screamer guy but starbucks that's actually pretty cool that's funny uh you can
[10124.31s -> 10129.59s]  pull out cards from some of the description parts some brands only use their original materials
[10129.59s -> 10138.28s]  okay if a slogan is missing or wrong we can't say it's authentic for the manual go to the brand
[10138.28s -> 10154.26s]  and find everbrown okay materials brands those brands bird of brands all right wild car for
[10154.26s -> 10175.64s]  brands uh list of brands so this is uh um how do i hold the x arcade how do i do this i don't see

[10212.22s -> 10218.26s]  text for everbrown is a thumbnail of a material that looks like the one you saw take out that
[10218.26s -> 10225.32s]  card this is this kind of wood signature wood from uh from this brand pull out a card from
[10225.32s -> 10235.80s]  the sentence most products of which crack in less than a year potential garbage potentially a piece
[10235.80s -> 10241.40s]  of garbage okay potential garbage good job lastly pull up that card that says selling its products
[10241.40s -> 10251.51s]  is a good way to lose reputation this will hurt my reputation what is this an anger management
[10251.51s -> 10260.65s]  test i'm not selling i think i understand it let it go bob it was a piece of junk anyway you just
[10260.73s -> 10268.41s]  learned how to defend against brands with a negative image using the manual breaking news
[10268.41s -> 10275.46s]  the association has announced a new fining policy the new policy states that the fine amount
[10275.46s -> 10279.62s]  adverse criminals should pay to prove their non-possession spirit and avoid arrest will
[10279.62s -> 10287.27s]  determine by how rich they are for this the avac came up with a new concept called re-unionciation
[10287.27s -> 10292.73s]  rate renunciation rate refers to the percentage of property that must be given up to prove non-
[10292.73s -> 10299.56s]  possession spirit if re-unit whatever that word is is 10 percent and the property is 10 000 the
[10299.56s -> 10303.78s]  final we have thousand which is 10 of the property for all the citizens the initial rate is set at
[10303.78s -> 10308.73s]  five percent the av official said the rate can be raised or lower depending on the behavior of
[10308.73s -> 10315.37s]  each citizen along with this citizens who actively donate to the avac can now benefit more from this
[10315.37s -> 10322.30s]  evening each citizen's donation amount will be checked on a weekly basis oh fuck so i get lower
[10322.30s -> 10331.21s]  taxes if i donate to the avac this is a reporter okay there's a lot of new info here you look
[10331.29s -> 10338.79s]  familiar i'm a member of the association just call me mary don't worry i'm not here to take
[10338.79s -> 10345.54s]  you in i have a favor to ask of you i investigated these names on the list who are against fixed
[10345.54s -> 10351.98s]  rain uh he's an actor he loves to be recognized and be the center of attention he was outright
[10351.98s -> 10356.70s]  against fixed rain saying no one recognized him or like him anymore after it i have one
[10356.70s -> 10361.50s]  complaint about this game this is very annoying but i'm very annoyed by it uh next is professor
[10362.14s -> 10366.78s]  i am not skipping it's doing it i'm not clicking the arrow you do know he is on a solo protest
[10366.78s -> 10370.63s]  don't you i'd like to take i want to be able to take the information in more i don't just skip
[10370.63s -> 10374.55s]  it for me he's against every single one of the association policy is the most dangerous one
[10374.55s -> 10383.77s]  the last is seong-gong a member of our association i believe you've met him before but i can't find
[10383.77s -> 10390.68s]  where she's from who her family and friends are uh nothing however i can tell she joined the
[10390.68s -> 10398.26s]  association for her own reasons but first i want to take care of young ji mo and professor choi
[10398.34s -> 10405.10s]  these two these two people come in to sell anything tell them you'll pay a lot what i'm saying is
[10405.10s -> 10416.02s]  offer them at least double the evaluation price what i want it done this week and they may not
[10416.02s -> 10427.54s]  be idiots but likely to be adverse criminals okay hold on let's go to the settings no i can't it's
[10427.54s -> 10433.34s]  just skipping dialogue for me i don't like that like let me do why i even have the down arrow
[10433.34s -> 10451.00s]  that indicates so you can hit a or something how much is the emotion tracker emotion tracker
[10452.20s -> 10462.87s]  oh whoa wow 750 bucks he just came right in hold on bob there's a problem it seems the woman who
[10462.87s -> 10468.82s]  tried to sell us the everbrown ring is back biting us the citizen discourse data says she's telling
[10468.82s -> 10473.51s]  people we called her ring garbage didn't you really get it was the shitty ring and its owner
[10473.51s -> 10480.78s]  to be blamed but there are always people like her they're so malicious fortunately i don't see
[10480.78s -> 10485.26s]  any change in this card attracted us to darcy's however okay because we had a good reputation to
[10485.26s -> 10492.41s]  start with time has come to learn about the last reputation card attractiveness of darcy's this
[10492.41s -> 10498.07s]  card tells customers moods when they're leaving our store okay this card's effects will become
[10498.07s -> 10503.43s]  increasingly disadvantaged to you if you behave recklessly or hurt customers feelings by ignoring
[10503.43s -> 10510.47s]  their demands it only works during haggling and disappears right after your purchase causing a
[10510.47s -> 10519.46s]  change to the appraised value okay fyi or attractiveness doesn't go up and down in a flash
[10519.46s -> 10524.34s]  so please don't be too obsessed with it trying to be nice to every customer the plant is dying i
[10524.34s -> 10529.85s]  i can't water the plant normally the price effect of the card attracted will gradually fall below
[10529.85s -> 10535.38s]  zero and keep falling so i don't want to be still let us buy things at lower prices you don't have
[10535.38s -> 10539.38s]  to think so hard though just keep in mind that you reaching level five means your attractiveness
[10539.38s -> 10546.09s]  raging is its peak by the way she's so annoying okay kind of like you uh talking every day i need
[10546.09s -> 10555.05s]  somebody to fill up the showcase okay good how do i do this since i'm not an expert i don't know its
[10555.05s -> 10566.79s]  details but you're an expert you can find something right attractiveness of darcy's who's 67 all right
[10566.79s -> 10578.49s]  let's take a look uh it's not it's it's not damaged it's fine it's made out of wood wouldn't
[10578.49s -> 10586.42s]  yeah 2067 it said 2067 what do you got uh nothing significant on it but it's probably signed let's
[10586.42s -> 10592.06s]  take a look all right he's got no signature fun all right so how is this authentic how do i know
[10592.06s -> 10608.57s]  that they painted this i can't i don't know just wouldn't it's not a brand and this is wood i don't
[10608.57s -> 10612.25s]  know who painted that i can't be i can't validate this i'll give you a hundred fuck a hundred fucking
[10612.25s -> 10631.54s]  bucks for it i give you 450 this is a taxidermy how do you taxidermy a bug what are you talking
[10631.54s -> 10638.97s]  about oh no no no i was giving it a second thought if i could trust your recommendation the truth is
[10638.97s -> 10646.26s]  i'm in graphological study club and the club holds meetings every monday so i thought i could rely
[10646.26s -> 10652.46s]  on you to get something with an autograph for today's meeting but it occurred to me that your
[10652.46s -> 10656.70s]  recommendation may not be satisfying if your recommendation turns out to be reliable i'll come
[10656.70s -> 10664.92s]  back so i would love to turn over and talk to you guys but the game just skips all the dialogue
[10664.92s -> 10670.28s]  there's a full letter grade reduced for me that's a literally a full letter grade if that's a full
[10670.28s -> 10675.16s]  letter grade bob you've heard the news that avac found the fixed rain tech file see like i am
[10675.16s -> 10682.86s]  that's a full letter grade and the av uh okay like you're not allowed to not look at the screen
[10682.86s -> 10688.47s]  this is the time for our union to step up we got to hold a protest against fixed rain i know avac
[10688.47s -> 10693.03s]  has never told us they would stop the fixed rain if you're gonna have like 500 pages of dialogue in
[10693.03s -> 10697.91s]  a game let me like let me read it and decide when i'm ready to go like you can't just just like a
[10697.91s -> 10707.58s]  fucking cutscene i have to pay attention to hold shift i didn't do anything i've already asked all
[10707.58s -> 10717.72s]  the merchant members i'm holding shift right now no didn't do anything it's not a streamer game
[10717.72s -> 10720.36s]  even if i was just sitting here playing this like i can't even look what am i gonna look for somebody
[10720.36s -> 10726.39s]  what's what somebody text me and i look down for five seconds what do you say bob are you gonna be
[10726.39s -> 10737.43s]  with us all right all right he's talking about the union meeting pause the game how do you

[10784.86s -> 10788.94s]  for saying so that means all of our union members will be together with that in account i believe
[10788.94s -> 10795.43s]  avc won't ignore what we say the citizens will pay more attention to so right after you get off work
[10795.43s -> 10800.22s]  come up to the first floor we'll be there every evening you don't need to bring anything i'll
[10800.22s -> 10810.14s]  tell you what to do i have to do it every day what if i forget two pieces breaking news the first
[10810.14s -> 10815.90s]  piece of news after being arrested for excessive perfume usage a woman countersued an avac member
[10815.90s -> 10822.65s]  who arrested her the woman said he is holding a huge piece of bread when he arrested me claiming
[10822.65s -> 10830.02s]  eating that huge bread alone is also avarice on this matter professor young joe choi who is on
[10830.02s -> 10835.82s]  a solo protest said my concerns have become reality saying this is why i'm crying for clear
[10835.82s -> 10842.01s]  guidelines okay he's also making another claim of his own that abc is developing a new technology
[10842.01s -> 10848.90s]  to replace artificial rainfall new technology my ass if you say i declined to comment on this
[10848.90s -> 10854.50s]  claim next up more than 200 citizens are complaining of severe cold symptoms so what
[10854.50s -> 10861.32s]  they're already doing it to us yeah they're already doing it to us this rain is not natural
[10861.96s -> 10867.42s]  they're already trying something else i felt sorry but the rule of no umbrellas allowed will
[10867.42s -> 10876.33s]  remain okay okay this is the reporter of the news all right yeah they're already they're
[10876.33s -> 10885.70s]  putting something in the water right whatever i like to sell this in a hundred years already

[10963.00s -> 10966.68s]  i heard a rumor that someone in the citizens alliance institute had found an antidote for
[10966.68s -> 10972.78s]  fixer this is too many names i can't remember all these fucking names but the picture is not
[10972.78s -> 10978.14s]  a poison what was the there's like the institute of uh crimes of against institutes like it's too
[10978.14s -> 10985.03s]  many names defending against fixer to protect floaties it was an antidote was a cure so even
[10985.03s -> 10991.50s]  though i know this too i mean nothing left i will go to the institute this weekend to look for any
[10991.50s -> 11000.33s]  clues about the antidote there's like two names i want to ask you to get me two things so that i
[11000.33s -> 11007.83s]  can get to the institute one thing is an av ac id card some people are stealing the id cards to
[11007.83s -> 11013.10s]  mess with avac and surely some of them will come here to sell the cards the other thing is time
[11013.10s -> 11018.63s]  cinema which i invented myself by setting a certain time and shining it on a particular site you can
[11018.63s -> 11028.86s]  watch a hologram of what happened to the time and place okay someone stole it last week i tracked it
[11028.86s -> 11033.82s]  down and found it somewhere near this shop i'm sure the thief is picking the right time to sell
[11033.82s -> 11040.58s]  my time cinema to you so please help me to get an avac card in my time cinema back by this friday
[11040.58s -> 11044.42s]  with your help i'll be able to get to the institute we can change the world together
[11044.42s -> 11052.25s]  remember your brain's running on a dual core processor i've been reading you a book for three
[11052.25s -> 11064.90s]  hours is this authentic easy enough you can see the slogan can't you you can't tell just by the
[11064.90s -> 11072.58s]  slogan easy enough change their slogan before just take a look all right all right first of all this
[11072.58s -> 11084.30s]  thing sucks core two duo uh brand easy enough let's see if that's accurate all right is this
[11084.30s -> 11101.70s]  uh even on here this is this this canvas yeah this is canvas made out of canvas let's find out first

[11127.46s -> 11131.46s]  easy enough some of its products have soldiers names and those who believe in the rumor collect
[11131.46s -> 11138.73s]  them also sells goods other than bags uh this is no this they don't sell canvas bags this is fake
[11138.73s -> 11163.51s]  i mean i hate to be the bearer of bad news here but this shit ain't real uh this is wrong material
[11163.51s -> 11188.44s]  sorry that did seem cheap so i mean if you got a fake bag here there's a missing slogan too
[11188.44s -> 11191.40s]  usually there's a slogan on it they didn't yeah what are you talking about you aren't
[11191.40s -> 11195.56s]  making any sense what it says they have a slogan shit it does have a slogan on it it's right on
[11195.56s -> 11210.90s]  there fuck does it need a verifying autograph some of its products have names that's fine
[11210.90s -> 11224.42s]  you already confirmed it's fake i mean what does brand eraser do wrong slogan yeah that's what i

[12496.79s -> 12501.43s]  feeling i'm being chased by something these days because avac set me up as their number one target
[12501.43s -> 12507.93s]  you know avac hates me for standing against fixed rain my idea is that everyone has a right to
[12507.93s -> 12512.39s]  decide whether to get fixed or not when they first proposed their idea about fixed rain their excuse
[12512.39s -> 12517.56s]  was equality they claimed people with physical impairments were not having equal access to fixer
[12517.56s -> 12523.42s]  but but listen avac has never let people use umbrellas during fixed rain and they poured
[12523.42s -> 12532.42s]  down fixer like crazy for a week but i think that was the worst case of human rights trampling
[12532.66s -> 12536.42s]  i got carried away sorry there's the door right behind you if you're done
[12537.88s -> 12543.35s]  no no no i came here to sell something actually it's so beautiful right whenever i look at it their
[12543.35s -> 12551.21s]  tenacity please cut to the chase uh i don't need a lot of money because avc might come after me

[13374.60s -> 13380.81s]  first check if there's a signature on the artwork when the signature is on the signatures list
[13380.81s -> 13388.23s]  when the signature is not on the list or no signature is found okay they're looking for
[13388.23s -> 13395.74s]  signatures again pull the out the art cards famous signatures okay you can see the signatures of the
[13395.74s -> 13405.59s]  famous use the signature detector on the painting yeah no signature it wasn't a signature on this
[13405.59s -> 13410.20s]  painting right that means you cannot use the celebrity signature list nor admit it as a
[13410.20s -> 13417.69s]  famous artist let's skip to the artwork page as this painting doesn't have any
[13417.69s -> 13424.81s]  autographs you should choose from either failed poor or fine piece failed piece refers to pieces
[13424.81s -> 13433.45s]  that seem to be drawn by foot fine piece refers to carefully drawn paintings or pieces somewhere
[13433.45s -> 13444.50s]  between those two how would i be able to tell trash go on bob choose one i mean it's is it
[13445.06s -> 13461.32s]  technically a good fine piece okay well you didn't paint it with your foot that's clear right uh
[13463.58s -> 13468.49s]  failed it's no it's it's like a fine piece there's nothing wrong with it
[13468.49s -> 13481.48s]  looks good it's a fine piece that's a no it's a fine piece but uh artists on the list great
[13481.48s -> 13487.51s]  piece when it was created into artist prime when it's already dead but none of these make any more
[13487.51s -> 13500.66s]  sense you're not on the list so i don't do anything else there's no artist so what do i
[13500.66s -> 13511.27s]  have a option to pick this like nothing nobody there 1503 i mean that's a that's pretty fucking
[13511.27s -> 13539.54s]  old 1503 it's kind of archaeologically valuable is this the actual mona lisa it's slightly damaged
[13539.54s -> 13550.46s]  but did anybody paint real fake shit check the quality it's slightly damaged there's no
[13550.46s -> 13575.22s]  signature though is the actual mona lisa um okay i'll offer you 500 bucks for it okay i'm selling
[13575.22s -> 13582.97s]  this for a thousand some art collectors may visit the store they don't care about paying extra
[13582.97s -> 13586.82s]  so it's not a bad idea to not to not sell the artworks and wait for them to make a huge profit
[13586.82s -> 13603.13s]  oh shit deceased artist the the world's best crab grass on the showcase how much is it
[13603.13s -> 13615.88s]  in my opinion 42 is right mona lisa has no signature it doesn't i've never i've never
[13615.88s -> 13633.27s]  seen the mona lisa i'll it's fine i'll take that i don't care it doesn't i don't what am i you

[13727.70s -> 13732.63s]  news the association of victims of adverse crimes announced that 80 percent of fixed rain tech
[13732.71s -> 13736.55s]  files have been restored the official said they might start the fixed rain as early as this
[13736.55s -> 13744.44s]  weekend that's too early this weekend what first ever person accused of adverse crime hawn huang
[13744.44s -> 13751.22s]  started a new life by becoming an artist i'd like a new start too huang stated someone claimed that
[13751.22s -> 13758.46s]  i exploited chippies but chippies were my friends adding chippies will be the main theme of my work
[13758.46s -> 13764.60s]  and i guess huang's occupation has now changed last up the recycling committee has announced
[13764.60s -> 13769.26s]  that this week's target material is plastic citizens who actively participate in plastic
[13769.26s -> 13774.81s]  collection will be given hughes made of recycled material don't be excited bob it's only for

[13782.86s -> 13790.76s]  raise the materials price oh oh oh and if we already have plastics in an inventory the price
[13790.76s -> 13796.76s]  is enough do i have plastic shit in my inventory the bookmark on the showcase how much is it
[13796.76s -> 13810.52s]  it's made of the plastic doesn't seem to be worth that much in my opinion 732 is a good what's this
[13811.78s -> 13819.94s]  oh that oh do i have plastic stuff over here this is not flat all right this is all sold do
[13819.94s -> 13830.97s]  i have anything plastic do i need to hold on to this stuff this is plastic but i this is my as an

[14987.48s -> 14992.07s]  fully this is why okay i'm gonna give you another criticism this game so if i don't have to fully
[14992.07s -> 15000.06s]  appraise things the last time i tried to not fully appraise something the lady said you didn't fully
[15000.06s -> 15010.66s]  appraise it why not and i had to fully appraise it anyways like can i actually do that some
[15010.66s -> 15021.02s]  customers just are just dicks you have to fully appraise for your reputation you can't buy
[15021.58s -> 15038.63s]  sometimes they don't notice all right i'm gonna let's start i have 550 bucks it's a mere celebrity
[15038.63s -> 15063.06s]  well i don't want to make the price more expensive i'm gonna do 500 would you please make me this
[15063.06s -> 15070.47s]  thing deserves more of your attention well i don't want to fully appraise it because i won't be able
[15070.47s -> 15081.85s]  to afford it why did i pay the loan back that was the worst decision i've made the entire game
[15081.85s -> 15089.50s]  uh make sure that i can get at least one of the two items what does he want he wanted um what
[15089.50s -> 15103.54s]  does he want what does this guy want he wanted like the id card what did he want exactly how
[15103.54s -> 15116.52s]  much is it um see 100 bucks that's not what i can afford can you please cut it to 68 all right well

[15205.16s -> 15211.10s]  uh this game i'm confused about how this game works sometimes because like you don't fully
[15211.10s -> 15215.74s]  appraise something they say but fully appraise it but like i have to do some appraisals like
[15215.74s -> 15224.89s]  i have to do some of the stuff i understand all right 2074 uh what is this the first is

[16461.88s -> 16466.82s]  were like so i went to his house and the security was so bad i found this was just lying on the
[16466.82s -> 16475.45s]  ground oh wait is that thing a long time ago choy was talking about a time machine or time
[16475.45s -> 16480.73s]  capsule or something he boasted about how he made a machine that looked good let me read it i wanted
[16480.73s -> 16486.07s]  to use it so i stole it but i can't figure out how to use it for the life of me so i'm just going
[16486.07s -> 16495.32s]  to sell it for a low price okay oh let's see it's in uh so i just like who cares and just buy it
[16495.32s -> 16506.34s]  because he just wants it he sure is real the world's fastest travel with professor choy

[16623.91s -> 16637.16s]  know anything you really get on my nerves i woke up in like an old guy's apartment
[16637.16s -> 16654.02s]  well maybe that was my apartment movie script this is bad condition this is very bad um i would say
[16654.02s -> 16664.42s]  it's probably fairly damaged though though i don't think it's that brutal although let's see if it's
[16664.42s -> 16669.21s]  made out of what is it made out of paper yeah here's the kicker though when was this made
[16669.21s -> 16683.50s]  oh no this is not like all right 2076 significance and oh it's the sky it's like actor actor famous
[16683.50s -> 16698.49s]  for being a narcissist he is his script he just drew all over it okay well it's an artist where
[16698.49s -> 16707.69s]  is the celebrity type service uh it's signature of an artist and i know exactly who it is and
[16707.77s -> 16717.02s]  young people are gonna love it but at the end of the day it's still kind of rough around the edges
[16717.02s -> 16744.30s]  i'll give you 20 bucks for it 35 30 30 32 why do you keep calling the guy an artist it's triggering
[16744.30s -> 16751.46s]  because i've i don't make the rules of the game sniff sorry i have a cold after the rain last

[18104.46s -> 18110.52s]  the week we announce our new plan last weekend the association stopped the resumption of fixed
[18110.52s -> 18116.02s]  rain however we are still deeply concerned that it will lead to more crimes therefore we'd like
[18116.02s -> 18121.61s]  to ask for your active cooperation in tracking down avarice criminals from this week from today
[18122.09s -> 18127.19s]  all citizens must cooperate to hunt down 90 avarice criminals each week by abiding by this
[18127.19s -> 18133.26s]  one rule agic city will be free from fixed range forever however if you fail for if you fail for
[18133.26s -> 18138.42s]  two consecutive weeks fixed rain will begin immediately they will we will distribute criminal
[18138.42s -> 18142.89s]  report button whenever you meet a person who is suspected to be an avarice criminal just press
[18142.89s -> 18149.59s]  the button if a citizen gets reported once they will receive pre-averice criminal badge if twice
[18149.59s -> 18154.04s]  they'll be judged as an avarice criminal who should pay a fine or get arrested you can check
[18154.12s -> 18158.20s]  the number of criminals searched out during the week in real time through the billboards in
[18158.20s -> 18162.66s]  fountain square names of excellent reporters and of places where avarice crimes are frequent will
[18162.66s -> 18169.58s]  also go public we're hoping for the day when agic city is reborn as an avarice crime safe city
[18169.58s -> 18181.42s]  without the help of fixer thank you i ain't reporting shit i ain't reporting anything
[18181.42s -> 18205.80s]  good look look at your face enjoyed a lazy weekend huh definitely arrested look at that
[18205.80s -> 18212.50s]  greedy face i'll never i'll never let me display it what if it's a place with a lot of avarice
[18212.50s -> 18215.78s]  crimes you better not go there i'll get the report their neighbor is so ruthless all right
[18215.78s -> 18231.70s]  see that's where that person's ever been arrested all right did you get the morning broadcast just
[18231.70s -> 18239.13s]  as it said let me give you the report button you can press it right from today and can you see the
[18239.13s -> 18245.58s]  small display above it on its left is a count of your reports for the day while the other is a
[18245.58s -> 18251.37s]  count of your reports for the week please don't be afraid to press it in the face since they cannot
[18251.37s -> 18258.65s]  know if you press it or not okay here will be the total number of criminal arrests of the week for
[18258.73s -> 18268.73s]  the city this is getting so complicated oh emergency meeting this is a badge for
[18268.73s -> 18273.29s]  preliminary criminal if you report someone without this badge they'll soon be listed on the criminal's
[18273.29s -> 18280.65s]  list and receive this badge however we will arrest or levy a fine on them in a matter of
[18280.65s -> 18287.46s]  minutes if they already have this badge i forget to check the bulletin board at fountain square
[18287.46s -> 18296.18s]  upstairs shows the name of the citizen who most actively pressed the button in real time the names
[18296.18s -> 18300.18s]  will be announced throughout the city and receive special benefits special benefit sounds good the
[18300.18s -> 18308.92s]  board also displays the name of high crime spots on which the store can also get nominated once
[18308.92s -> 18314.36s]  average criminal customers visit here often or anyone outside reports your customers a lot and
[18314.36s -> 18321.96s]  nobody all right whatever i don't like i just sell fucking toys what if we never press it you'd
[18321.96s -> 18326.92s]  better not take it as an option for the city unless you make at least one or two reports every day
[18326.92s -> 18334.12s]  and we'll get hit with fixer show your responsibility as a citizen of agic city okay so i have to do it
[18334.84s -> 18352.71s]  okay mr i am from age of capital i'd like to tell you some sad news unfortunately age of capital
[18352.71s -> 18358.55s]  is terminating its domestic business soon and the fix ran comes if it does there will be no more
[18358.55s -> 18364.60s]  floaties to loan money to but before that happens i wanted you to know that you can take out an
[18364.60s -> 18373.88s]  emergency loan if you need one mister you should look onto it the guy from the simpsons have a
[18373.88s -> 18378.36s]  great day mister i don't need five thousand dollars right now i manage my money well
[18379.00s -> 18389.61s]  you can kindly leave i got the registration i did be the official manager of darcy's cool
[18390.34s -> 18395.67s]  by the way you got that report button i was going to give you something useful today but
[18395.67s -> 18400.31s]  i guess it might be too much for you now that uh we're being overburdened with that stupid button
[18402.28s -> 18407.38s]  life is full of challenges uh well yeah this might be a great chance for you to grow up
[18407.38s -> 18413.77s]  as you can see this is a vertivo hoverboard but let's say the customer who brought this
[18413.77s -> 18420.79s]  in doesn't know that you'd probably start thinking like if i share the card vertivo
[18420.79s -> 18426.01s]  the customer will surely expect more money but what if i don't share it that's what i asked
[18426.01s -> 18430.09s]  four hours ago however as you know the card allows you to put a higher price when you resell the
[18430.09s -> 18440.86s]  hoverboard exactly when the private slot should come to the front do you see the new piece of
[18440.86s -> 18445.77s]  equipment underneath the card slot try and find the card vertivo from the manual and put it in
[18445.77s -> 18454.66s]  the private slot did it really take them five hours of gameplay to get here to do this okay
[18454.66s -> 18476.20s]  well this is a brand vertivo okay you just successfully hid the card using the private
[18476.20s -> 18482.84s]  slot hiding information that you don't want to share but if you hide cards that have a
[18482.84s -> 18492.41s]  pricey information on it you might get a complaint or a nasty rumor okay you can hide up to two cards
[18492.41s -> 18498.39s]  cards here will be kept secret until you successfully buy the item and they go public as you display the
[18498.39s -> 18506.98s]  item okay i get it be careful if you use this too often customers are going to notice by the way
[18506.98s -> 18513.34s]  darcy is there any problem with your watch screwdriver oh about the screwdriver i got
[18513.34s -> 18519.22s]  it taken away by the stabilizer i'm supposed to get him lobster phone but i failed that doesn't
[18519.22s -> 18524.18s]  mean you deserve to lose the screwdriver where did he learn all that torturing torturing skills
[18524.18s -> 18532.38s]  truth is that he's been taking my back every time i scavenge from the fixie area find the lobster
[18532.38s -> 18542.17s]  phone the authentic one disappeared asking to recreate it yeah yeah yeah i don't give a shit

[18550.09s -> 18555.62s]  when i pick it up and fucking elmo's on the other end i don't care go buy one at target it's just a
[18555.62s -> 18569.11s]  black telephone and a lobster more breaking news stabilizer won first place in last weekend's
[18569.11s -> 18574.41s]  non-possession spirit competition he's chosen by a citizen's vote one female citizen said he had a
[18574.41s -> 18586.10s]  sense of restraint especially i loved his closed lips get in here stop all right the flawless

[18625.94s -> 18634.39s]  all because of me and my occupation but everything will be fine eventually you know that right
[18634.39s -> 18639.24s]  anyway guess what i brought for you it's a gem appraiser that can give you a help when you're

[18644.44s -> 18652.79s]  show you how to use it garcia used to separate gems by their surprisingness or unsurprising
[18652.79s -> 18663.88s]  gems all he wanted to know was just their kind it analyzes the kind and the quality of a gem
[18663.88s -> 18670.22s]  and then you get gem cards at sight it's a beautiful ruby ring and the price is
[18670.22s -> 18680.31s]  1050 now click the gem appraiser and move it onto the ring there's like a picture of it
[18682.18s -> 18690.70s]  i just do wait now there must be a card that only seen by you can you see it it's a garnet not a
[18690.70s -> 18696.30s]  rupee am i right i assume the price dropped big too like this gem appraiser is the only way you
[18696.30s -> 18702.49s]  can check a gem's actual name so don't forget to use it especially on accessories uh you forgot
[18702.49s -> 18708.33s]  to mention the card brand eraser you must check if it's if a gem is missing or broken when a
[18708.33s -> 18715.40s]  customer brings branded jewelry that's the case it cannot be classified into general accessories
[18715.40s -> 18721.74s]  such as necklaces and earrings its brand effect falls too there's a lot of info okay sure sure
[18721.74s -> 18726.06s]  now i remember that card the brand eraser in a situation like you said you can bring out the
[18726.06s -> 18731.82s]  card brand eraser to reduce the price fuck you game oh dear i have no idea what's happening in

[19180.47s -> 19185.02s]  i'm in graphological study club and the club holds meetings every monday so i thought i could rely
[19185.02s -> 19189.38s]  on you to get something with an autograph for today's meeting it occurred to me that your
[19189.38s -> 19194.14s]  recommendation may not be satisfying to me if your recommendation turns out to be reliable i'll come
[19194.14s -> 19226.02s]  back get all this shit out of the window somebody buy this bracelet uh sell the hoverboard for 200

[19317.75s -> 19323.00s]  this is actually from fuzz fly the only thing now that i have to determine is who signed this
[19330.50s -> 19334.89s]  you did once a business man but he later became the first person accused of an
[19334.89s -> 19339.45s]  adverse crime he was charged with using chippies to build wealth luxury but was some what was
[19339.45s -> 19349.58s]  acquitted okay so this is by an artist it's a fake signature how do you know that's real
[19350.14s -> 19365.35s]  this is a real city what are you talking about oh shit the top right report that person um yeah

[19455.32s -> 19462.33s]  worth a lot more than you think it is let's see if we got anything else significant on here

[20982.60s -> 20987.40s]  that happen because my fans love and attention are what i live for as you know when fixed rain
[20987.40s -> 20994.22s]  comes there will be no one left to love me which means there will be no more reason for me to be

[22347.56s -> 22354.49s]  you're meaning to report me you want me to do it you want i would never report you
[22355.21s -> 22365.11s]  i may not report you but for now i may say something bad things about you how much is
[22365.11s -> 22391.96s]  the seemingly meaningful paper oh shut up i have verified it three times hi i'm trying to get a
[22391.96s -> 22398.58s]  gift from my cousin do you have anything to recommend what about some filters well it's
[22398.58s -> 22403.11s]  a gift anyway so i want some branded thing but at the same time i want it to be special
[22403.67s -> 22408.15s]  you know there's some products of the that that the brands genuinely don't make
[22408.15s -> 22419.99s]  marks of the brands genuinely don't make do you have anything um i have the mona lisa you want
[22419.99s -> 22435.54s]  a hoverboard genuinely generally i look i'm i'm reading a book for six and a half hours i'm gonna
[22435.54s -> 22446.58s]  say a word wrong sometimes um is this a this is like a branded thing i don't think i have
[22446.58s -> 22457.38s]  anything do you want this it's branded but too ordinary it's branded many of these things
[22457.38s -> 22470.89s]  branded no i don't have i don't have anything sorry absolutely destroyed on fixer water
[22472.92s -> 22480.23s]  what the fuck i don't have special secret branded stuff that you want i don't know what you want
[22480.23s -> 22499.00s]  there we go it's a big sale i also gotta think about when the stream is gonna end tonight
[22499.00s -> 22506.31s]  because i'm starting i'm starting to get a little winded let her see the secret menu
[22507.51s -> 22516.26s]  i want to see the secret menu yeah we're gonna add the secret menu sure i'll show you the secret
[22516.26s -> 22530.20s]  menu what we do is we put this fucking orange goo all over everything and say it's a secret
[22530.20s -> 22551.35s]  nothing do you like thousand island dressing because it's on everything as a secret
[22551.35s -> 22570.82s]  but he said oof where are the animal style hoverboards right you get it you get it oh what was it
[22570.82s -> 22577.21s]  uh i thought i thought i was like what's happening with the cat i'm sensitive okay
[22581.13s -> 22600.07s]  i kind of want to just junk this i don't want this in my inventory um all right so i i wonder if i
[22600.07s -> 22605.93s]  do i need to see the end i kind of like feel like we need to see at the end how this game ends right
[22605.93s -> 22618.42s]  how much longer do you think this is maybe have more than like an hour or so i don't know oh shit
[22618.42s -> 22642.23s]  b3 right is there a long time left probably i don't know it's hard to tell all right where b2 so b3
[22642.23s -> 22654.39s]  about two hours maybe it says it says about eight hours on how long to be
[22654.39s -> 22668.39s]  three houses left um i can i can i not buy this b3 right one room new room it's not open there are
[22668.39s -> 22682.10s]  30 days in the game and you're on day 12 oh like halfway you have to go in the morning oh it's
[22682.10s -> 22705.77s]  apparently 30 in-game days huh hmm what do i want to do about this um okay i got a plan i got a plan
[22705.77s -> 22716.63s]  here's the plan plan is so the the streams next week next weekend because remember i'm a
[22716.63s -> 22729.13s]  weekend andy i was gonna do delta rune sims 3 mod apocalypse and this let's do this so we'll
[22729.13s -> 22741.70s]  probably do okay so now that delta rune has been out for a day how long is delta rune chapter 2
[22741.70s -> 22755.51s]  is it possible to do both of these about four it's like four to six four to eight depending
[22755.51s -> 22766.36s]  hmm okay interesting like three to four four to eight three to five okay i think we can do
[22766.36s -> 22781.34s]  them both it's like yeah i usually go on the longer side i we need to see the end right
[22781.34s -> 22790.97s]  but i can't stream tomorrow i want to see the end all right if we have to do if we have to do three
[22790.97s -> 22809.40s]  days next week i'll do that but i don't think we're gonna have to current speedrun is it can
[22809.40s -> 22814.79s]  take one hour or 12 depending how much you dig around why don't you speak up streaming the week
[22815.51s -> 22822.50s]  uh i'll explain this for a lot of the new people here so i used to do like four days a week i
[22822.50s -> 22828.97s]  streamed like oh tuesday thursday friday and like sunday right i do like three four days a week
[22828.97s -> 22833.37s]  uh but i ran through an annoying medical problem that made it so it was hard to sit down or stand
[22833.37s -> 22837.90s]  or even the same place for more than three four five six hours of time and it was actually causing
[22837.90s -> 22846.18s]  me a lot of problems um i dialed back my streams because it was physically painful to just like
[22846.18s -> 22854.10s]  kind of sit here or stand i tried kind of it's difficult so i pulled the streams back and since
[22854.10s -> 22858.79s]  doing that i've actually felt a little better i'm able to kind of move around i'm able to do some
[22858.79s -> 22862.63s]  more things and it gives me more time to work on the big projects that i really want to work on
[22862.63s -> 22870.63s]  so it's kind of a win-win in a way streaming less means i feel a bit better and way more interesting
[22870.63s -> 22877.19s]  kind of projects can be worked on too at the same time gives me more time but if i'm able to and
[22877.19s -> 22883.13s]  that's why a weekend andy makes the most sense because streaming like saturday all right you're
[22883.13s -> 22886.33s]  gonna see me on saturday and i'll see you next saturday or like hey i'll see you saturday and
[22886.33s -> 22891.96s]  sunday right that's easy so doing weekday streams is always kind of like well which what day do i
[22891.96s -> 22898.39s]  pick i guess i'll just do it on tuesday or i guess i'll do it on friday right having those set in
[22898.39s -> 22903.14s]  stone it's gonna be like friday saturday or sunday makes it a little easier to kind of plan what i
[22903.14s -> 22909.06s]  want to do uh but i'm not against streaming more but i don't want to do what i was doing before
[22909.38s -> 22916.97s]  so it's going to be very rare to see more than two streams a week on this channel and sometimes it
[22916.97s -> 22921.40s]  might be one i don't want to fuck around with this because i've been feeling a little bit better
[22921.40s -> 22927.24s]  and one of the big contributors has been i'm not sitting in this chair for like eight hours four or
[22927.24s -> 22931.30s]  five days a week because my streams used to be way longer too i used to i used to sit here till
[22931.30s -> 22936.54s]  at least it was like my stream average was like seven and a half to eight and a half hours
[22936.54s -> 22946.18s]  so i really want to keep myself honest here and do that kind of explains why but it look if i feel
[22946.18s -> 22949.78s]  like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it it's never a guarantee but we'll see so i think we can do
[22949.78s -> 22962.86s]  this next weekend simpson's hit and run imagine you're a streamer and you develop anti-streamer
[22962.86s -> 22977.02s]  disease i mean sometimes it feels like that i'll be honest anti-streamer disease uh yeah so all
[22977.02s -> 22982.30s]  right i'll see you guys next weekend we'll call it here i think it's a good place to do it thanks
[22982.30s -> 22988.71s]  for watching as always i'm gonna go get some food because i don't want to go too much longer if there
[22988.71s -> 22993.93s]  really is another like four to five hours left in this game i kind of want to see the end i feel
[22993.93s -> 22999.48s]  like we're invested at this point and again my only complaint of this game is i wish i could
[23000.12s -> 23005.48s]  not have it go through the text before i press the button that's okay that's one of the only
[23005.48s -> 23016.78s]  complaints uh but i'll see you on let's go with uh friday friday we're gonna do sims mod hell
[23016.78s -> 23021.90s]  saturday we're gonna do delta rune and possibly this if delta rune takes a long time then maybe
[23021.90s -> 23029.26s]  you'll see a stream on monday we'll see i will see you next week oh sunday sorry i'll see you
[23029.26s -> 23048.65s]  next weekend let's see how many how many people subbed there's a lot have a great night see you
[23048.65s -> 23061.27s]  then psycho uh yeah friday at 2 p.m and after we do the sim stuff uh i'm trying to think of some
[23061.27s -> 23069.67s]  there's a lot of other things we can do i have a list of games to play after next weekend there's
[23069.67s -> 23077.90s]  probably going to be a couple of pre-stream polls so those will come back because i have a lot of
[23077.90s -> 23086.46s]  options and i'm not sure which ones to do do any one of them to be honest and that's right it's
[23086.46s -> 23098.33s]  my birthday week coming up this week so it'll be 36 pretty old getting up there not 40 yet though
[23098.33s -> 23117.32s]  that's the big one 36 that's old that's not too old but it's old enough hub happy hobbit day
[23117.32s -> 23137.26s]  are you gonna be a 40 year old streamer i don't know i have no idea retire at 39 retire 39 364
[23137.26s -> 23153.78s]  days you gotta make it to 37 um i have no idea it's the rest of the time that i spend on the
[23153.78s -> 23162.28s]  internet here and do content creation in quotes like influencer e-clown it's when i'm not having
[23162.28s -> 23168.95s]  fun anymore when i think i've had my fill and i think it's over i mean you'll know i this is
[23168.95s -> 23175.06s]  really important though i don't want to just turn this stream on because i feel like i have to or
[23175.06s -> 23179.77s]  like i'm forcing myself to i want it to be fun i don't want you guys to think that i'm just like
[23179.77s -> 23187.42s]  turning it on just because like i fucking has to that's the number one thing that i care about on
[23187.42s -> 23191.90s]  this stream is is it a fun environment am i having a good time am i actually enjoying myself
[23191.90s -> 23198.79s]  or do you think it's fun i don't want to be like a old crabby like washed up asshole that like
[23198.79s -> 23206.92s]  should have probably stopped but just didn't you know what i mean like i don't want that to happen
[23206.92s -> 23225.45s]  so i don't have a set date for that i don't have a time frame for that stream till you're 80 he's
