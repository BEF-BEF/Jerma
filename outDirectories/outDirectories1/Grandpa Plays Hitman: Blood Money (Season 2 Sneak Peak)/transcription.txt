[0.31s -> 16.80s]  Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here, and today I have some Hitman, the Blood Money.
[16.80s -> 22.80s]  And today I want to play this game because Hitman Absolution, the sequel to this, is coming out pretty soon.
[22.80s -> 28.80s]  So I want to just show you my special techniques and how I take out the bad guys.
[28.80s -> 33.80s]  So this is the Vineyard level, and this is the guy we're going to kill right here, right by the door.
[33.80s -> 37.80s]  So this is a good technique. What you want to do is you pull out the mine.
[37.80s -> 42.80s]  And who gives a shit about these people running around? You just want to drop it in...
[42.80s -> 44.80s]  Where is he? I think he's right here.
[44.80s -> 49.80s]  Drop the landmine, take a little stroll over here, pull out the detonator, and see you later, motherfuckers!
[51.87s -> 53.87s]  What an explosion that was!
[53.87s -> 62.87s]  This is the guy. Oh. Well, I killed him anyway, so if you don't kill him with the blast, then just... Jesus, that was rough.
[62.87s -> 71.94s]  Also, this game is all about stealth. You want to be really quiet, and you want to use a syringe to make sure you put the people to sleep and not kill them.
[71.94s -> 74.94s]  Hey! What are you doing? Don't shoot it!
[74.94s -> 76.94s]  Don't shoot it!
[76.94s -> 80.94s]  Okay, let's try this again. Pull out the mine, everybody run scared.
[80.94s -> 83.94s]  Yeah, yeah, get the fuck out of my way. I don't want to deal with every inch.
[83.94s -> 86.94s]  Drop the mine, come on, come on, come on! I've never done this before! Come on!
[86.94s -> 90.94s]  Yes! I did it! I actually did it! Okay, now I...
[90.94s -> 94.94s]  I don't know what to do now. That's the first time I've ever done that.
[94.94s -> 96.94s]  Oh, okay, pull out the machine gun.
[96.94s -> 101.94s]  I don't know what to do! I don't have any bullets left! This is stupid!
[101.94s -> 104.94s]  Okay, I just, um... think here, grandpa. Come on, think!
[104.94s -> 108.94s]  I'm going to just... Oh my God, grab a gun! Grab somebody's gun!
[108.94s -> 112.94s]  Seriously, what the fuck is going on here?
[112.94s -> 118.25s]  Okay, so I've come to the realization that you're not supposed to use the mine.
[118.25s -> 123.25s]  So I'm just going to drop it at the beginning of the level so nobody sees it and I don't get in any trouble.
[123.25s -> 127.55s]  And then... What? What? What?
[127.55s -> 130.79s]  Why did that guy just pick up the mine?
[130.79s -> 133.97s]  Hold on a second, what is this guy doing?
[133.97s -> 137.97s]  Excuse me, you just picked up a fucking mine!
[137.97s -> 143.97s]  So this is hands down one of the weirdest things that's ever goddamn happened to me in a video game.
[143.97s -> 145.97s]  So this guy has the mine, can I blow him up?
[145.97s -> 150.46s]  Can I detonate this guy in this entire goddamn room? Are you serious?
[150.46s -> 158.20s]  You know, typically I would laugh at something like this, but that was just sad.
