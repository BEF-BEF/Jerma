[6.26s -> 19.30s]  How are you? Welcome back to Virtual Reality with Jeremy985. We're going to begin today
[19.94s -> 27.51s]  with Space Channel 5. Sorry I wasn't here yesterday. I think I severely underestimated how much pain I
[27.51s -> 34.31s]  was going to be in yesterday. I woke up and I turned till I get out of bed. It was like
[36.07s -> 41.19s]  that's the best way to describe pain. Especially turning pain. Those of you guys that have like
[41.19s -> 51.43s]  rotational pain. That's a perfect noise for it. It sucks. But I'm good. I'm here. I'm not. Oh my
[51.43s -> 58.55s]  God. I just fucking fell over. These cords. I swear to God. I'm not even on camera and I almost
[58.55s -> 65.56s]  just fell down. I didn't even do anything. I'm not taking the brace off today. Don't let me do that.
[65.56s -> 68.76s]  It doesn't matter how much of a sweaty bastard I am. Don't let me take this thing off.
[69.72s -> 74.42s]  It is doing something very important. It's over it's it's I'm wearing I'm doing a Doug
[74.42s -> 80.41s]  Funny right now. I'm wearing it over my clothes. Doug Funny used to wear his underwear over his
[80.41s -> 89.24s]  clothes as that superhero uh Quailman. So just think of it like that. Health a healing curse?
[91.08s -> 98.26s]  If it works then do it. You don't kill it can we collectively? I'm serious. Let's do this. I'm
[98.26s -> 102.50s]  gonna get on camera. We're gonna collectively fucking have like like a healing session.
[103.06s -> 110.82s]  Can we do that? If you have to imagine if like five to ten thousand people all collectively
[110.82s -> 115.78s]  think the same thing at the same time will that work? Like the neurons and like the weird
[115.78s -> 119.70s]  simulation that we're probably living in like will like the data get processed and like will
[119.70s -> 128.49s]  my like pain go away tomorrow? Let's try it. Give me the healing. What's the curse part though?
[129.21s -> 133.27s]  Hold on a second. Let me just get my never ending supply of fucking White Claw.
[133.99s -> 147.70s]  How's it gonna be? Well yeah I'm doing it today. Just a little. This is how you summon what? No
[147.70s -> 152.34s]  dude don't call it a healing curse. Call it like a a healing potion and we have to go over some
[152.34s -> 157.06s]  things too because there are people that think I'm like four feet tall. This is really important.
[157.06s -> 168.42s]  We have to okay I'm just gonna put the cam on. See I moved the camera a little bit because
[168.42s -> 176.07s]  can you hear me? I hope you can. All right first of all I got the fucking championship belt on.
[177.43s -> 182.68s]  Just I didn't texture it yet. I feel like a fucking videographer. This is just giving me
[182.68s -> 188.68s]  flashbacks. Okay yeah get the big get the groom get the groom. All right so listen to me this is
[188.68s -> 198.07s]  important. This this is not a window okay. I that I hung it's a blanket I hung on the wall
[198.07s -> 202.31s]  because it's so echoey in here. I had to put up something to absorb the sound.
[203.27s -> 215.50s]  Understand that's not a window. Second of all this base station is six three. This is I measured it.
[215.50s -> 223.32s]  It's six foot three. Do you see that? It's like six fucking four. I don't know why everything looks
[223.32s -> 234.97s]  so tiny on this camera in this room. Like look ready I I look like fucking minuscule. I don't
[234.97s -> 242.28s]  know why. You know what it looks like? Have you ever seen those um okay you know those optical
[242.28s -> 247.56s]  illusions where it's like the huge guy is standing here and there's like a tiny little person in the
[247.56s -> 252.12s]  corner and it's just like oh wow oh my god this is and they're in a room and the furniture looks
[252.12s -> 258.86s]  all weird. Like it's because the room is like 50 feet long and it's like slanted. That's what's
[258.86s -> 264.87s]  going on here because look it no I'm normal person but when I go back here I don't know why.
[265.83s -> 275.91s]  But I don't understand it looks so bizarre or whatever. That's not a window. I'm five eight. Get
[275.91s -> 303.26s]  over it. I wanted that to be so loud. You got a short neck? I don't have a short neck. That's such a
[303.26s -> 312.36s]  fucking insult. I don't know why. You know oh hey you're a fat guy. Oh you're stupid. Your neck is
[312.36s -> 323.18s]  too short. That fuck that like hurts. I don't know what to say. You got anything to say? You got
[323.18s -> 340.07s]  anything to say to the camera? Go on say it. All right we're gonna play. We are going to play
[341.03s -> 347.27s]  face channel five virtual reality edition. I've been waiting for this. It's not a monster zero.
[348.07s -> 358.26s]  It does kind of look like a monster. All right all right fuck it we're going. I'm going in the
[358.26s -> 368.55s]  headset now. I can't hear you or I'll be able to in a second. Are we ready? We good? What about

[461.91s -> 470.26s]  you don't want to put in your body? Can you imagine like burping like if no controllers are
[470.26s -> 478.81s]  connected? What are you talking about? Did I take too long? It might be too loud. We'll find out.
[480.25s -> 489.24s]  Oh there you are. Acid sneeze. Say happy birthday to Catboy. Happy birthday Catboy.

[2683.66s -> 2690.49s]  skipping. Do you guys know that I thought that Miku was a real person. I didn't know that it was a
[2690.49s -> 2696.41s]  vocal whatever robot. I thought it was like an actual like singer. I didn't think it was a vocal.
[2696.41s -> 2701.91s]  Whatever there. I until like six months ago I thought like Miku was just was like a singer.
[2702.47s -> 2711.29s]  This is going to be hard to do. I'm going to try. Hopefully this is not too loud for you.
[2711.93s -> 2741.21s]  Do I spill it. I don't think so. No. I don't think so. But I've heard some of Miku's songs.
[2742.94s -> 2753.05s]  Who's Miku. How old are you. I don't know. She's real to me. Space drink. Alcohol. There are no laws
[2753.05s -> 2760.28s]  where you're drinking. It's not. I can't. I'm drinking a fucking White Claw in a VR environment
[2760.28s -> 2774.14s]  in my own space. I'm telling you guys this helps. So two days ago where I almost puked from the
[2774.14s -> 2779.82s]  dinosaur game. That's not going to happen today. All right. Should I be key or Rue.
[2785.67s -> 2804.23s]  I'm excited for this. Miku's far out report. I thought she was like eight feet tall. What.
[2804.79s -> 2810.49s]  I thought she was like seven seven or something. I thought she was huge. Who the fuck is that.
[2823.99s -> 2844.58s]  Okay. Did I say that. Okay. Are we ready. Here come the aliens. Time to dance.
[2845.30s -> 2913.74s]  Who's this little weird guy. Good. Okay. Let's go. Not the cat. I don't want to be the cat.
[2929.21s -> 2942.01s]  Rescue successful. This is where I got to. Excuse me. Miku. Miku. Can I get a selfie real quick Miku.
[2942.01s -> 2968.12s]  I'm sorry. I'm just a huge fan. Oops. Hey did the viewers go up because Miku is here now.
[2980.65s -> 3006.90s]  Did they literally. Yes. Oops. Shit. It's only halfway through. Holy shit.
[3016.38s -> 3040.95s]  Oh that's another successful rescue. Be careful. Oh hard mode.
[3044.78s -> 3058.04s]  Rue bought prime. Where are the guns. Where are the guns. Where's the shooting. I know.
[3058.04s -> 3078.15s]  Just give me a minute. I can fucking move still even with a pain condition. You'll never take
[3078.15s -> 3105.67s]  that from me. You'll never get it from me. Stop making sounds for no reason. Oh I don't want to
[3105.67s -> 3149.42s]  do that. No. Whatever. 89. That's all right. This game makes. What. This game makes light of war.
[3150.06s -> 3160.17s]  What are you talking about. Oh this game makes light of war. Let's finish this together.
[3164.63s -> 3173.38s]  What did you think Miku. Did you like what I did. Did you like me. Did you like what I did.
[3174.49s -> 3179.29s]  Oh just do it. Do it normally. Oh yeah. Bye.
[3181.85s -> 3204.06s]  See you later. Good wave. I think that's all to see. We got to do this. Do it all.
[3204.06s -> 3211.77s]  I'm not going to open this game ever again. I mean like that's actually like not.
[3211.77s -> 3215.88s]  I'm never going to open this game ever again. So much. We'll do the stuff that's here.
[3223.77s -> 3238.09s]  A hundred stage dance battle. Holy shit. I'm ready for this. You're going to be dead after this game.
[3238.09s -> 3248.20s]  I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm a human. My blood is ready pumps. I like to fuck too. What does he say.
[3262.28s -> 3275.69s]  Is that me. Oh no.
[3302.02s -> 3304.10s]  Stage 11. Let's go.
[3335.35s -> 3357.32s]  What. That was right. All right. We're moving on. What the fuck is happening.
[3358.60s -> 3361.08s]  I'm winning. That's what's happening.
[3361.08s -> 3420.63s]  I keep saying that.
[3420.79s -> 3425.77s]  fucking OBS. It's showing me like 10 seconds ago. It's freaking me out.
[3425.77s -> 3457.10s]  Woof. That thing. That thing. That thing. I gotta do it. Meow. Woof. Meow. Up. Meow. Left. Meow.
[3457.10s -> 3468.61s]  Right. I didn't tell me they're gonna go faster than that.
[3468.61s -> 3500.63s]  Genuine Phil. What? Oh, Honda. That was fucking perfect. Honda. Honda. Woof. Honda.
[3500.63s -> 3531.99s]  Honda. Honda. That's so fucked up. I'm in a coma. I'm in a coma and I'm trying to
[3531.99s -> 3537.28s]  get out of the coma. I feel like I'm lying in a bed right now and my
[3537.28s -> 3540.40s]  face is kind of twitching a little bit. Like I'm gonna wake up soon if I do this.
[3540.40s -> 3568.93s]  Toyota. Toyota. Toyota. Toyota. Honda. Toyota. Woof. Honda. Woof. Meow. Fuck. I got it.
[3568.93s -> 3604.19s]  Oh God. You were in a car accident? No. I can't. Toyota. Honda. Toyota. Honda. Honda. I was like struck by a car.
[3604.39s -> 3626.31s]  Oh no. I can't. I can't. I can't. Oh.
[3626.31s -> 3631.20s]  Macho.
[3642.89s -> 3659.08s]  When does this end? I'm gonna beat this whole thing.
[3659.16s -> 3666.52s]  Jaguar. Jaguar.
[3671.26s -> 3684.51s]  Oh shit. Jaguar. Macho.
[3692.77s -> 3696.39s]  Car thing. I can't.
[3712.21s -> 3726.30s]  I'm almost there. I'm seriously almost there.
[3728.57s -> 3764.13s]  Meh. Meh. Jaguar. Meh. Hey. Oh, I'm getting a pulse. I can hear him. I hear like the nup, nup, nup. Come on, Jeremy. You can do it.
[3764.13s -> 3780.50s]  I'm coming. That's too many. It's the gorilla driving the car. That's just the movies.
[3786.81s -> 3803.02s]  Gorilla book. Gorilla reading book.
[3834.86s -> 3867.62s]  Pose. Just do it all. Shit. Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose. Jaguar. Did I do it? Holy shit, I did it.
[3868.18s -> 3876.15s]  I just sat out of the bed. It was the gorilla reading a book. He was driving a Jaguar.
[3876.15s -> 3884.03s]  It's like, Mr. Elbertson, you had hernia surgery. Are you okay? You've been here for like a few days.
[3884.03s -> 3902.25s]  Alright, I think that's good. That was fun. Wait, did you see how many calories you burned? 180 calories. Wow.
[3902.25s -> 3912.87s]  Alright, that was cool. I'm gonna drink some water. We're gonna do Sniper Elite VR. Talking to you.
[3918.28s -> 3925.59s]  Only 180 calories? Yeah, that's not that much. Do the roar. Oh, what was wrong with Boneworks? Alright, hold on.
[3925.59s -> 3934.02s]  I figured it out. So, Boneworks was a game that came out way before Alyx.
[3934.02s -> 3940.38s]  And I remember it was like, wow, a game that's actually utilizing the knuckle controllers.
[3940.38s -> 3946.38s]  And it's like, oh, look at the physics and shit. I played Alyx before I played Boneworks.
[3946.94s -> 3953.38s]  Isn't that kind of an issue, right? Like, Alyx is one of my favorite games ever.
[3953.38s -> 3957.38s]  It was my game of the year last year. It's the best VR game I've ever played.
[3957.38s -> 3963.38s]  So, I didn't play Boneworks before Alyx. Therefore, it was kind of a stepping stone to get to Alyx in a way, right?
[3963.38s -> 3974.02s]  I think that's why I found it a little underwhelming. At least me personally, right? Fuck you.
[3974.58s -> 3982.14s]  Hey, listen. I didn't say that. I don't think Boneworks is a bad game. It just didn't grab me.
[3982.14s -> 3986.57s]  That's it. It's probably fucking really good. The physics are fucking awesome.
[3986.57s -> 3990.57s]  It was really fun. The gun shooting seemed fun. The stuff having weight, that was cool.
[3990.57s -> 3995.70s]  It just didn't grab me. And that's okay. That's okay.
[3995.70s -> 4001.54s]  I don't think it's a bad game. I never said that.
[4001.54s -> 4015.50s]  I think me playing Alyx first set expectations in a weird way. I don't know why.
[4015.56s -> 4022.68s]  It was made to be innovative, not to be a good game. Well, I mean, it was, right?
[4022.68s -> 4029.28s]  I remember watching the dev videos. I don't think it's a bad game. Stop putting words in my mouth.
[4029.28s -> 4035.28s]  All right, Sniper Elite VR. If one of the mods could change it to Sniper Elite VR, that would be fantastic.
[4035.28s -> 4050.24s]  Go ahead and hold on. Can I not select it from here? Come on, dude. What the hell?
[4050.30s -> 4056.92s]  Oh, really? I don't have to. Oh, shit. I can't select it. Wait. Oh, my God. I'm using this.
[4056.92s -> 4065.54s]  All right, Sniper Elite VR. Where are you? There it is. All right, let's do it.
[4065.54s -> 4086.73s]  Pick up that can. You look like a gnome. Your opinion doesn't matter.
[4086.73s -> 4093.78s]  Oh, that's interesting. You know, the gnomes are like part of the reason why the Alliance was able to get to the fucking place that they were.
[4093.78s -> 4098.54s]  You understand the amount of cookies that you ate from those Keebler elves, those little gnomes?
[4098.60s -> 4105.44s]  Fuck the gnomes, right? You understand how important they were?
[4105.44s -> 4115.10s]  They protect your fucking garden, bro. Don't ever speak of that again. Alliance.
[4115.10s -> 4119.85s]  All right, so this is Sniper Elite VR. I think this is probably fine.
[4119.85s -> 4126.83s]  Subtitles probably on. I would assume, right? Calibrate height. Cool. Comfort.
[4126.83s -> 4134.08s]  Sprint vignette off. Smooth turn dot off. Belt size, ammo pouch position right.
[4134.14s -> 4138.14s]  Kill cam normal. Kill cam follows bullet. I guess it's just default off.
[4138.14s -> 4143.82s]  Graphics quality. Get that shit on fucking high, please. I got a 3090. Excuse me.
[4143.82s -> 4152.66s]  What a flex. It's not a flex, though. I paid like three times the price for it.
[4152.66s -> 4157.09s]  Like, it was a stupid thing to do. I had to get a graphics card. This is back when they didn't fucking exist.
[4157.09s -> 4165.44s]  All right, let's go. This seems good. Okay, new game.
[4165.44s -> 4179.14s]  Right-handed. Teleport movement. Snap turning. Intense. Free movement. Why is he sick?
[4179.20s -> 4183.78s]  Free movement. Smooth turning. All comfort assists are off.
[4183.78s -> 4194.02s]  Free movement. Snap turning. What should I put on? Put it on intense?
[4194.02s -> 4201.36s]  You will puke if I don't put it on something else. Okay. So should I do...
[4201.36s -> 4208.15s]  I don't think I want to do intense. You look like an action figure. Thanks.
[4208.15s -> 4216.28s]  Intense, intense, moderate. I'm going to do moderate, okay? I don't want to puke.
[4216.28s -> 4224.32s]  Difficulty select. That's fine. I'm going to get a giant VR video play.
[4224.32s -> 4235.57s]  Take this opportunity. You know what I'm doing. Oh, you guys can't even see the movie.
[4235.63s -> 4237.63s]  I am... This is not...
[4239.63s -> 4244.50s]  The height's wrong. I need to recalibrate the height, please. Hold on.
[4251.11s -> 4256.31s]  Oh my god. That didn't help. That didn't help. Oh my god.
[4256.31s -> 4264.94s]  Revert, revert, revert, revert, revert. Why is it doing this?
[4264.94s -> 4271.10s]  I need to fix the floor. I'm way too fucking small. I am as tall as that child.
[4271.10s -> 4297.06s]  This is wrong. I can't pick anything up. That's a shitload of bread.
[4297.12s -> 4315.54s]  We're going to eat all this bread? This is de-dust.
[4315.54s -> 4319.91s]  This is actually de-dust.
[4322.71s -> 4330.90s]  I'm sitting? I don't remember sitting.
[4340.46s -> 4344.70s]  Movement. Okay, walk here. Rotate. Alright, let's go.
[4344.76s -> 4354.49s]  Hold down the grab button. Out of bounds. What the fuck are you talking about, dude?
[4354.49s -> 4361.21s]  Hold down the grab button. Oh, get the rifle? How am I supposed to get the rifle?
[4361.21s -> 4366.14s]  It's like blocked. What? Oh.
[4366.14s -> 4375.10s]  Shit. It's the index. I have to hold it.
[4375.10s -> 4379.10s]  Stow the rifle by putting it over your shoulder. Great. Another fucking put it over your shoulder bullshit.
[4379.10s -> 4393.30s]  Up full. Okay. Move to the window. Okay. Draw your rifle.
[4393.30s -> 4401.43s]  You got it. Pull the bolt back. Retrieve ammo from your belt.
[4401.49s -> 4414.53s]  Insert clip into rifle. Where does that go?
[4414.53s -> 4419.54s]  Did that work? Push forward to relook. Okay. Hold on the rifle
[4419.54s -> 4425.94s]  with your second hand. Raise and look through the scope.
[4425.94s -> 4433.36s]  Oh my god. I don't know if you guys can see this. Can you guys see this?
[4433.36s -> 4440.23s]  Can you guys see me aiming? You do? Okay. You can see through the
[4440.23s -> 4445.99s]  everything? Good. Look through the scope. Who am I shooting? Squeeze the trigger to fire.
[4445.99s -> 4451.75s]  Okay. Steady yourself. Hold your breath.
[4451.81s -> 4460.78s]  In real life. Hold focus to steady aim.
[4460.78s -> 4464.96s]  Focus slowly slows time and shows the hit indicator.
[4464.96s -> 4471.68s]  Okay. Hold focus to steady aim. How do I do that?
[4471.68s -> 4483.66s]  Oh shit. That's a fucking headshot. Oh this is fucking crazy.
[4483.66s -> 4491.73s]  Radio. Where's the radio? Oh there it is.
[4491.73s -> 4504.05s]  Rechamber. Use. Did I do it? Did I use
[4504.05s -> 4515.68s]  the radio? Use. What do I do? Did I get it?
[4515.74s -> 4520.49s]  Use. What do you want me to do? What does it want me to do?
[4520.49s -> 4534.92s]  You already did it. Okay. Now what? It's a save point.
[4534.92s -> 4540.19s]  Why did I throw the gun? I'll just get it. That guy took the gun.
[4540.19s -> 4547.68s]  Get to the gate. Okay.
[4547.68s -> 4562.80s]  Oh I have a gun.
[4562.80s -> 4588.08s]  Alright. Both. That's Dante. Oh. Can I run faster?
[4588.08s -> 4595.55s]  Sorry. Sorry. I'm the drunk guy again.
[4595.61s -> 4610.63s]  Oh shit. Dante. Dante.
[4610.63s -> 4616.84s]  Let's go. You can fuck with me buddy. Goodbye.
[4616.84s -> 4631.16s]  That guy's dead. Oh over there. What? I thought that was
[4631.16s -> 4642.89s]  explosive. It was explosive. Why did it take so long to get there?
[4642.89s -> 4651.53s]  Did I get him? I got him. Oh sick. Shit.
[4651.53s -> 4664.17s]  Got him. Headshot. Alright his brain.
[4664.17s -> 4698.09s]  This bullet travel. Oops. Right in the knee. Alright let's go.
[4698.15s -> 4708.28s]  Here. Take the weapons. Take them all.
[4708.28s -> 4727.81s]  What's this? Let's go. Jump.
[4727.81s -> 4740.82s]  Is that a bad guy or is that a good guy? I can't imagine. I feel like this is like a
[4740.82s -> 4755.03s]  modded Call of Duty. Alright I got full ammo. Let's go. Oh you
[4755.03s -> 4779.54s]  motherfucker. God damn it. Who's left?
[4779.54s -> 4787.75s]  Who's left? Come on. Fuck.
[4787.75s -> 4793.72s]  I can get him. I'm not out of bounds you stupid game.
[4793.78s -> 4812.54s]  Stop shaking. Oh. In the mouth.
[4812.54s -> 4820.48s]  Who's left? I'm not even out of bounds. This is stupid.
[4820.48s -> 4842.83s]  Where is he? No. I did it.
[4842.83s -> 4848.10s]  You're stupid. It was all scripted. Who cares?
[4852.10s -> 4856.40s]  You're so sweaty. I know.
[4856.40s -> 4861.02s]  Game audio is low?
[4861.08s -> 4865.39s]  Interesting.
[4865.39s -> 4870.83s]  Better?
[4870.83s -> 4876.33s]  Oh hello kids.
[4880.33s -> 4884.33s]  Do you look like a dancer?
[4889.71s -> 4893.71s]  This game sucks. That's not fair. That's not fair. Don't say that.
[4893.77s -> 4911.24s]  This is kind of fun. I'm actually just kidding. It's actually kind of fun.
[4911.24s -> 4917.72s]  Boneworks 2? No. I'm just kidding. This is actually fun.
[4917.72s -> 4924.12s]  New mission. Let's do it. What am I doing out here?
[4924.12s -> 4935.83s]  Wait did he have bread in his hand? Wait I think she has bread in her hands.
[4935.83s -> 4940.52s]  God damn it. It's my day off. I don't want. Just leave me alone out here.
[4940.52s -> 4955.62s]  Why can't I just read Calvin and Hobbes in peace?
[4955.62s -> 4965.80s]  Alright let's do it. Rifle range. Let's go.
[4967.80s -> 4971.80s]  No scopes?
[4976.23s -> 4980.54s]  Brick and Morty now. No. You look like an Oompa Loompa.
[4980.54s -> 4987.85s]  Just rewind an hour and figure out why. I just have these always.
[4987.85s -> 4998.07s]  Oh wait no. It's just Mjolnir.
[4998.13s -> 5002.13s]  What?
[5008.13s -> 5026.05s]  This is way better than that.
[5026.05s -> 5037.81s]  What do you got? 10 targets? Where are they? Let's go.
[5037.81s -> 5046.26s]  Why do I have to do this? You just taught me how to use the rifle.
[5052.92s -> 5055.48s]  That was so loud.
[5061.02s -> 5065.52s]  Alright. I'm going to talk shit about VR again.
[5065.52s -> 5070.70s]  I'm going to talk shit. Let's do it. This doesn't have to be here.
[5070.70s -> 5074.70s]  You just showed me how to play the game.
[5074.70s -> 5078.70s]  I don't have to learn how to play. You just showed it to me.
[5078.70s -> 5083.14s]  Do I need a tutorial shooting range? You just showed me how to play the game.
[5083.14s -> 5087.31s]  Why are you so terrified that I'm going to not know how to shoot the gun?
[5087.31s -> 5097.25s]  Just do it. You know what I mean?
[5097.31s -> 5112.09s]  It's like, let me tell you about this immersive story.
[5112.09s -> 5116.09s]  Are you sure you know how to use the weapon? No. Get him out to a range and make sure he can hit a target.
[5116.09s -> 5130.19s]  It is so loud. I know.
[5130.19s -> 5147.26s]  Oh come on.
[5147.26s -> 5153.85s]  Deadly. Your voice was loud?
[5153.85s -> 5165.64s]  You're talking mad smack for reloading with the wrong hand.
[5165.64s -> 5181.45s]  So now what do I do? Can I leave?
[5181.51s -> 5185.51s]  Use the pistol. Arm. Use grip to pull slide.
[5185.51s -> 5189.93s]  And you reload. And then you go like this.
[5189.93s -> 5200.17s]  Is it another range?
[5200.17s -> 5205.80s]  God. Just let us play.
[5205.80s -> 5215.14s]  You're terrified that we don't know what we're doing.
[5215.14s -> 5224.30s]  Pick up the grenade.
[5224.30s -> 5230.87s]  Hold to aim.
[5230.93s -> 5241.04s]  Why did I just shrink? Oh okay. Hold to aim. What did I do?
[5241.04s -> 5250.20s]  I pulled it out.
[5250.20s -> 5255.06s]  Alright.
[5255.06s -> 5259.30s]  I'm literally sitting right in the center of my play area. What are you talking about?
[5259.30s -> 5265.19s]  Okay pistol area. Which is over there now. Alright let's go. Is there a teleport?
[5265.19s -> 5281.56s]  No. Is there a fast run? Equip a pistol.
[5281.56s -> 5290.84s]  This is how you make a lot of people mad.
[5293.59s -> 5298.92s]  I need a, I need a bullets.
[5310.93s -> 5331.24s]  Not bad. Not bad.
[5331.24s -> 5347.30s]  Very good. Not bad. Not bad. Oh yeah.
[5347.30s -> 5353.52s]  Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Right yeah. He's not very good.
[5353.52s -> 5357.52s]  Is he? You don't think so? Oh look at him. I'm so far behind.
[5357.52s -> 5377.70s]  I went beware German snipers. What are you talking about? What's going on quit mission journal?

[10083.32s -> 10085.40s]  I don't know if la noir is gonna work out
[10087.28s -> 10093.12s]  Somebody said that this came out when the vibe was a thing and they probably haven't updated it a very long time
[10094.72s -> 10097.59s]  Damn it
[10097.59s -> 10099.43s]  Uh, give me one sec
[10099.43s -> 10104.39s]  It crashes a lot
[10104.39s -> 10107.27s]  The cord's fine. Yeah, I checked the cords. Everything seems plugged in
[10108.23s -> 10113.99s]  There's an old ass game it doesn't support index fuck well that was fun for what I got to see
[10115.03s -> 10119.35s]  It's time for rick and morty
[10119.35s -> 10123.35s]  All right. I will play rick and morty vr for 30 minutes if you promise that none of you will leave

[10271.41s -> 10273.73s]  Uh mods change it to compound, please if you could
[10280.23s -> 10281.83s]  That's so sad

[10299.03s -> 10300.47s]  thriving
[10300.47s -> 10303.92s]  That was kind of terrible to be honest
[10304.56s -> 10306.56s]  I really feel like I was gonna be sick
[10306.64s -> 10310.80s]  Because when you're moving what you're not moving forward it really does a toll on your brain
[10315.84s -> 10318.40s]  It just hammers your like right in the frontal lobe
[10319.36s -> 10323.46s]  All right. Let's do it compound time
[10326.79s -> 10328.79s]  Damn, dude, you shit out of that fat ass

[10339.17s -> 10341.81s]  So it might look like I have whatever
[10342.61s -> 10349.32s]  What do you want me to say?
[10349.32s -> 10353.00s]  Why did I read that because it was there and it was for me. I could see it
[10353.72s -> 10371.49s]  I could see it. All right, let's go
[10371.81s -> 10378.20s]  Wait, you can't even see

[10712.02s -> 10714.02s]  Rebel hq fuck it's itchy
[10714.66s -> 10723.62s]  This is really kind of nice looking though
[10724.18s -> 10726.18s]  tutorial and shooting range
[10727.41s -> 10730.53s]  Very cool. Oh, it actually is like completely index compatible

[10794.13s -> 10796.55s]  Those the bullet spread is too high to hit anything distant
[10797.27s -> 10799.97s]  Sure
[10799.97s -> 10803.41s]  Okay, reloading is a skill and you'll need to practice
[10806.40s -> 10811.40s]  How do I get it?
[10811.40s -> 10815.24s]  To reload the smg press the spawn ammo button on your offhand controller

[10884.82s -> 10888.29s]  How do I load rail gun is perfect dealing with high damage long range, right?
[10889.11s -> 10891.11s]  Four shots take your time
[10893.70s -> 10897.62s]  Okay, put a stripper clip on the bolt opening on top of the rail gun
[10898.26s -> 10902.80s]  Isn't it going here?

[11725.56s -> 11728.44s]  All right, this uh, this game's an early access still that's
[11729.49s -> 11736.92s]  Really surprising actually
[11748.50s -> 11749.78s]  Oh
[11749.78s -> 11758.87s]  Nothing over there. We're good. It's easy
[11759.51s -> 11762.79s]  It's early access and yet it's still better than a lot of triple a games. I mean, this is fun
[11763.35s -> 11767.81s]  This is one of the sickest alpha games i've ever seen if this is alpha
[11769.04s -> 11771.04s]  I mean, this is really fun
[11772.13s -> 11774.77s]  If they're bosses then this is like i'm gonna give it a pretty
[11788.82s -> 11794.12s]  That it
[11809.54s -> 11816.71s]  I kind of want a different gun

[12023.01s -> 12030.50s]  Oh nothing
[12030.50s -> 12033.70s]  Gamer game. There's no bosses on easy. Can you do a weld?
[12034.42s -> 12038.74s]  Um, I think it'd be hard to move and do a weld actually maybe not because I can move with the right stick too
[12039.62s -> 12056.18s]  I'll try it. Oh shit
[12064.13s -> 12079.84s]  Oh god, this is gonna be hard i'm gonna i'll give it a try you can only shoot him a couple times though

[12133.89s -> 12141.76s]  Sick. All right. Good the contrast between now and sniper elite
[12143.68s -> 12156.82s]  I mean sniper elite is that game is more precise. This is more about like moving around fast. That's it, right?
[12158.28s -> 12164.23s]  It is let's go try a harder difficulty
[12164.95s -> 12169.56s]  Weapon unlocked laser pistol. I'll up the difficulty if I can after this
[12171.25s -> 12175.67s]  I feel like this is gonna be probably a boss
[12176.34s -> 12180.05s]  number one priority
[12180.29s -> 12185.51s]  Oh my god, wrong way wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong

[12240.45s -> 12245.48s]  There's no commentary just weird guy in vr with like a big ass plays compound
[12260.36s -> 12263.27s]  Yeah
[12263.27s -> 12269.01s]  All right. This is a huge level. Should I go down?
[12269.65s -> 12277.38s]  I'm thinking probably go up
[12277.38s -> 12285.40s]  Are we clear? I guess I should I investigate
[12286.20s -> 12311.14s]  There's nothing else in here really up the elevator. I think that's right go up go down. Oh shit right here
[12312.18s -> 12321.09s]  Very very oh new weapon. No, I already had that
[12321.73s -> 12330.53s]  Give me something new. I don't want that. I don't like that thing. Somebody said reloading sounds like eating a radish
[12331.17s -> 12354.63s]  I guess all right new level. Where's the exit? Oh, it's over here
[12365.09s -> 12370.93s]  Profit management too. Does it any idea how much more I have before like a boss or something or is it procedurally generated?
[12382.85s -> 12388.50s]  No bosses. There's no bosses in easy. Oh, so should I like back out and put it on higher difficulty?
[12393.28s -> 12407.30s]  That looks like a boss
[12407.38s -> 12409.22s]  shit

[12452.32s -> 12457.44s]  Where do I put this? How do I make the game hard?

[14468.10s -> 14470.20s]  That's also a thing
[14470.20s -> 14478.12s]  This is different
[14478.12s -> 14480.12s]  Oh, that was a lot of fun though
[14482.13s -> 14484.88s]  Thanks for watching

[14499.60s -> 14504.47s]  All right, let me write the games I played
[14504.71s -> 14505.91s]  and
[14505.91s -> 14507.91s]  Space channel 5 vr was an
[14508.47s -> 14511.99s]  An 8.7 out of 10. It would have been like a 9
[14512.47s -> 14515.67s]  It would have been like an 8 point. No, it would have been like a 7 7
[14516.71s -> 14518.63s]  But I mean like miko, you know what I mean?
[14520.84s -> 14527.57s]  Uh sniper elite vr was probably like an a but I just couldn't handle it. So i'm gonna give it like a c plus
[14528.53s -> 14534.85s]  Then compound was an a plus
[14535.73s -> 14539.12s]  What was between that?
[14539.12s -> 14540.64s]  What else did I do?
[14540.64s -> 14544.95s]  What was the third game?
[14544.95s -> 14550.29s]  L.A. Noire. All right that that that would have been so much fun
[14551.17s -> 14552.85s]  I would have stayed in that
[14552.85s -> 14558.61s]  Then obviously tilt brush is like
[14558.69s -> 14560.69s]  Five out of five
