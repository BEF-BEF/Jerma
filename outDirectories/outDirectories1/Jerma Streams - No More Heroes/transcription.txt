[1.78s -> 10.79s]  Good afternoon, everybody. No music, what happened? Why is it muted? I didn't do that.
[12.46s -> 21.86s]  I swear to God, I didn't do that. Already upset. Hi, how are you? Welcome back to another live stream.
[22.58s -> 29.56s]  Today, we are going to be playing No More Heroes. We actually are going to play it today.
[29.56s -> 32.60s]  I was going to play it yesterday, but had a little bit of a Bluetooth problem.
[33.56s -> 36.94s]  That problem has been resolved. Troubleshooting.
[41.51s -> 45.48s]  I'm gonna explain something. Yeah, it's all set.
[46.87s -> 56.55s]  Go to the dentist, you idiot. Did you brush your blue teeth? Why would I have blue teeth?
[60.84s -> 64.28s]  Why would I have blue teeth? I don't understand this reference from what?
[66.95s -> 76.71s]  Oh, because of Bluetooth. I had a Bluetooth. Jeez. And you guys. And you guys. That was weird.
[76.71s -> 82.95s]  You guys minus two shit. If I said that, it'd be minus two all day. You would clip that and say
[82.95s -> 89.67s]  worst joke of the decade. Come on now. Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
[90.47s -> 102.15s]  What are we doing? Oh yeah, right. We're gonna play No More Heroes. This is an original Wii game.
[103.48s -> 106.44s]  Actually, you could argue this is one of the best games that came out for the Wii.
[107.32s -> 116.41s]  We're getting a No More Heroes 3. Took a long time to get it, but we're playing one of the
[116.41s -> 125.05s]  best games on the Wii. This game has lightsabers. So you could argue that this is a better Star Wars
[125.05s -> 136.06s]  than the sequel saga. You could if you wanted to. Sure you will in this chat. True.
[136.14s -> 145.69s]  True. Why did I just say that? Now I'm gonna like ignite the fan base. I should have done that. Oh
[145.69s -> 154.81s]  well. But we just started too. Jerma sucks just gave 20 community subs. What fan base? Omega LOL.
[154.81s -> 159.61s]  Okay. You don't make an entire theme park around Star Wars unless at least 100 people are gonna go.
[165.67s -> 170.17s]  Jerma sucks really just gave 20 subs though. Thank you Jerma sucks. We'll see if I suck
[170.17s -> 178.81s]  because this game's hard. It requires skill, requires timing, and patience. It's a third person
[179.77s -> 187.70s]  slashing, dodging, blocking game. 70 yeah channel points have been changed a little bit.
[189.98s -> 196.62s]  It is now prices have changed and if you accumulate 75,000 points I'll wink on camera.
[199.45s -> 211.96s]  After the 20 community subs, $100 by Phylactery. 10,000 bits. Thousands of dollars that Phylactery
[211.96s -> 217.78s]  has given over the last few months continues to grow. They say missed the last few live streams
[217.78s -> 222.02s]  so had to watch the VODs. Here's some money for sucking on that used Wiimote and putting on
[222.02s -> 234.97s]  lipstick. Jesus. Thanks a lot for the huge fucking money drop man. 10,000 bits from Phylactery lich.
[236.36s -> 242.10s]  I didn't even tweet that I was live. It's because my phone was dead. Give me like two minutes. We'll
[242.10s -> 247.78s]  get going. Get comfortable. Get comfortable. My words hard today. They were hard last night too.
[247.78s -> 302.47s]  What's wrong with me? Be right back. All right. We've been tweeted. It's time to move over to know
[303.19s -> 318.60s]  more heroes. No more heroes for the Nintendo Wii. I got my Wiimote. I got my nunchuck.
[318.60s -> 325.78s]  Do you have to use both? This is where we pick the difficulty. There's only two difficulties
[325.78s -> 331.13s]  right now because you have to beat the game I believe first. How did I get the remote to
[331.13s -> 340.95s]  connect? A lot of bullshit. I mean sure why don't we go off on this? No I'm just saying I don't want
[340.95s -> 353.26s]  to go off every stream. I don't need to go off. I feel like every time I go off I'm just leaving
[353.26s -> 359.99s]  you guys a really long annoying string of 10 voicemails on your machine in a row. We don't
[359.99s -> 367.56s]  got to do that today. Let's just put it this way. Let's put it this way. It didn't work. I have
[367.56s -> 373.72s]  internal Bluetooth. Bluetooth sucks by the way. The technology never took off.
[374.86s -> 381.03s]  But it took off for like three years. No, I'm not going off. No I'm not. I'm just telling you. I'm
[381.03s -> 384.23s]  just going to give you some facts about what happened with this story. I'm just going to get
[384.23s -> 390.98s]  the bullet points. Everybody's motherboard has a Wi-Fi card built into it. Most of it.
[390.98s -> 397.30s]  You know internal. I have an internal Bluetooth. It's not good enough. It picked up five, six
[397.30s -> 404.33s]  probably houses down the street. Somebody's like fire stick. Okay. But it won't get my
[404.33s -> 408.89s]  Wiimote and it won't get anything in my room. So I had to go get a couple of different dongles
[408.89s -> 415.42s]  to test it out and try to get it to work. And I finally got one dongle in particular
[416.52s -> 424.47s]  that worked to connect my Wiimote. But there you go. It didn't even go off. We're not going
[424.47s -> 429.67s]  to do sweet. We're going to do mild. This game's hard. Many strong men await you. Yeah, it's going
[429.67s -> 442.36s]  to be hard. You're not going to shout them out. You want me to shout out a Bluetooth adapter?
[446.38s -> 456.47s]  Okay. So you would like for me to shout out a Bluetooth adapter. Special thank you to
[459.11s -> 469.43s]  I don't even know what the name of this thing is. What is it? No, that's the wrong one. I don't want
[469.43s -> 479.40s]  to shout out the... Is it dinner time? What was that? I want to say this right because if I say
[479.40s -> 490.55s]  it wrong, I'm going to be like a dick. A Targus? Is that correct? It's guys. It came in a package.
[491.43s -> 512.44s]  Hold on. I have to go under my desk. There it is. Yeah, it's a Targus. Yep.
[513.08s -> 519.62s]  So you can thank Targus Gaming for letting this happen. I know a lot of gamers out there don't
[519.62s -> 524.50s]  have much patience. Special thanks to Targus Gaming. Oh wait, you're not supposed to see this yet.
[524.50s -> 533.11s]  Okay, we're gonna see. Yeah, Travis Touch. By the way, I want to make this prediction now
[533.11s -> 538.39s]  because that's what I do. That's what we do in this channel. Travis Touchdown is going to be DLC
[539.35s -> 546.12s]  pack number two. Fighter's Pass two, character number three. There you go. Just that's going.
[546.12s -> 554.92s]  That's what's happening. All right, let's do it. Mild. Mild. Here we go. No more heroes.
[564.62s -> 569.02s]  You do ride a motorcycle in this game and notoriously all the motorcycle
[569.02s -> 572.06s]  driver but whether that's a full letter grade because you do get to drive it.
[573.19s -> 576.47s]  Unfortunately, the motorcycle it slows down the entire game
[578.97s -> 586.68s]  and no more heroes on the original Wii in the motorcycle segments ran at probably 15 frames
[586.68s -> 590.68s]  a second. I know a lot of gamers out there don't have much patience. At least that's what Bishop
[590.68s -> 597.78s]  the dude at the video store said. So I'm at the register and then I realized I got no money.
[597.78s -> 604.34s]  I was seriously broke. Why? Because I met this smoking hot chick last night at the death match
[604.34s -> 612.90s]  bar. Man, she smelled good. So being the gentleman I am, I bought her a drink. Anywho, I decided to
[612.90s -> 619.46s]  get a job. The gig? Assassinate the drifter. I love this game. So I went where I was supposed to
[619.46s -> 625.38s]  and waited for the guy to show up. And there he was. This cat. Well dressed, cool. Couldn't
[625.38s -> 631.70s]  tell if he was the shit or just plain old shit. Yeah, so he's stylish, fast, aggressive and packing
[631.70s -> 640.10s]  heat. Bada bing. Or at least it was supposed to be till she showed up. Her name? Sylvia Crystal,
[640.10s -> 645.06s]  an agent with this watchma call it association. The assassin skill. Congratulations. You are
[645.06s -> 651.96s]  certified as the 11th best hitman. How about that? I'm so pumped up for the new one above you
[651.96s -> 663.32s]  and aim for the top. How's that short and simple enough for you? It's gonna be a long hard road.
[664.44s -> 673.34s]  But who knows? Could kick ass. Could be dangerous. Could tell you suck. What do you say bro?
[673.50s -> 677.10s]  Yes, that is. Let's see how far we can get to medic. That is.
[689.75s -> 693.83s]  That's the medic. And he does a handful of voices in this, by the way.
[694.79s -> 697.83s]  And you're finally going to get to hear you're going to get to hear it. I can't wait to get here.
[698.95s -> 705.61s]  How many times have you guys heard me say on this stream? Are you prepared to have at least 100?
[706.57s -> 718.18s]  Fuckhead. Yes, I'm so ready for this. Help me out here. Where's this death metal dude?
[720.98s -> 730.65s]  Bad answer. It's from Star Wars. Star Wars movies. And you upgrade. You can get like different
[730.65s -> 735.45s]  lightsabers. You can get like this like 10 different lights. There's like 20 lightsabers
[735.45s -> 744.07s]  across the whole. I can't wait. Let's do it. Uh, I actually do not need to do the tutorial.
[744.63s -> 759.56s]  I don't. I know what the fuck I'm doing. Oh, it feels so good to play. It feels so good to play.
[760.44s -> 764.38s]  Now those of you that want to know, there is two stances in this game.
[765.42s -> 770.15s]  I might have to turn it down a little bit. A little bit on the loud side for you.
[771.35s -> 777.99s]  So you see the Wii mode. I'm tilting it right now. You have high, obviously. You blow.
[777.99s -> 784.79s]  And you have to choose between the two. And if you're facing the same- I'm so excited. I'm
[784.79s -> 789.78s]  so happy right now. All right, let's go. Let's go. I can't wait any longer. I gotta go.
[790.58s -> 812.42s]  Let's do it. The one- the best part about this is everybody has that same voice when you kill
[812.42s -> 827.62s]  somebody. There you go. That is also Robert Atkin Downes doing that voice.
[828.34s -> 839.62s]  Oh, this looks like a prototype from Metal Gear Rising. This is a better Star Wars game than Metal
[839.62s -> 848.39s]  Gear Rising. I'm sorry. It is. I know I'm going to probably offend people. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[851.56s -> 859.75s]  I was looking to chat. I was looking to chat. I know. Plus house. I hate everything about this.
[859.75s -> 862.15s]  Everything. This would be the worst stream of the decade if I could make it.
[863.03s -> 874.46s]  Get that person out of here. Get him out of here. Get him out of here. That's- that's unbelievable
[874.46s -> 882.66s]  for me to hear that. I have to be careful though because I will use the Wiimote and because I'm
[882.66s -> 889.64s]  sitting close to the mic. I will smash this into the mic. I can't be hearing this right now. I
[889.64s -> 898.39s]  can't be hearing this. This is a classic video game. Like one of the best fo- I would say this
[898.39s -> 905.37s]  is- No More Heroes. No More Heroes 2 is some of the- one of the best of the last generation.
[905.37s -> 913.98s]  You know what I mean? I think it is. Got a trading card. Don't anger Jeremy. He's in a good mood
[913.98s -> 926.20s]  today. Be careful. I'm going to get a double. Oh, you guys think that this- oh, you do- wait,
[926.20s -> 929.16s]  hold on. You don't like this game? Did somebody say they didn't like this game?
[930.20s -> 946.20s]  We'll- we'll see in about five seconds. Wait, I don't want to die. Here we go. Oh. Get him.
[954.06s -> 960.84s]  I'll show you. I'll show you why. I'm just having fun slicing people up. Here we go.
[960.84s -> 976.97s]  Oh, I got a power up. I can't even tell what's happening. All right. You sure you don't like
[976.97s -> 987.66s]  this game? Your grapple moves are all wrestling moves. He just did it. He said it. He said it.
[988.46s -> 1005.74s]  Are you prepared to help? Wanting one more? That's that block. Trading card number two.
[1005.74s -> 1013.96s]  I think there's a hundred? Two hundred? This is what it's like when a kid is showing their parents
[1013.96s -> 1027.62s]  their Minecraft house. Look. Look at- look at my house. Oh, wait. You watch. You can do this.
[1028.34s -> 1034.60s]  That's how you charge the battery. It's- it's got like that solar LED technology.
[1035.32s -> 1044.28s]  It's not a Minecraft house. I know for a fact that I- half you guys have never even seen this
[1044.28s -> 1047.56s]  game before. So I- yeah. Maybe it is my Minecraft house. I'm happy to show it.
[1050.01s -> 1072.55s]  All right. What- this- this is a Minecraft house. Where are they? This guy- look at- he's got
[1072.55s -> 1075.59s]  lightsaber fist weapons. They didn't put that in any of these Star Wars.
[1087.02s -> 1088.84s]  Ow.
[1096.89s -> 1101.62s]  That's legit. Yeah. Are you excited for No More Heroes 3? Oh, you better believe it.
[1101.62s -> 1107.24s]  That's why I'm playing this one. We haven't even gotten to the open world yet.
[1108.28s -> 1114.07s]  There's mini games. You have to work. I remember hating that part of the game. Do- okay. Do you
[1114.07s -> 1118.07s]  think I'm going to hate that part of the game again? It's been like 12 years. Do you think
[1118.07s -> 1128.86s]  I'm still going to get really mad at like collecting coconuts? Wait. Check that one.
[1128.86s -> 1137.96s]  They're mildly fun. You're going to like it more than the main game. I mean, it's possible,
[1139.08s -> 1149.62s]  but I don't think so. Oh, I gotta go back down. The only bullshit one is the one with the scorpion.
[1150.18s -> 1163.69s]  I don't remember it. The scorpions? You have to like step on a scorpion? Turn on the camera
[1163.69s -> 1168.78s]  when you charge the saber. Well, do you have 75,000 channel points yet? That's how you get
[1168.78s -> 1178.97s]  the camera to turn on. I don't see anybody with 75,000 yet. All right, let's do it.
[1189.42s -> 1193.42s]  Pain. You're a joke. What a pain. You're a joke.
[1194.38s -> 1213.38s]  Fuck that. Battery. All right. Who? Oh, there you go. Oh, this guy's also a Jedi. He's got a
[1213.38s -> 1237.51s]  lightsaber. Yep. See you later. 4,500 bucks. I love the aesthetic of the whole game too.
[1238.15s -> 1242.31s]  I love the little blocky quest markers. All right, I gotta actually pay attention there
[1242.31s -> 1250.15s]  because this is going to be hard. First checkpoint. Oh, he didn't say it. Fuck. I cut it off.
[1250.87s -> 1266.47s]  What's this? Oh shit. This is one of the superpowers. Get it. Am I even hurting anybody?
[1267.19s -> 1288.28s]  Right down the road. Fuck. Oh, here we go. There we do it. Let's do it again. They're blocking now.
[1288.28s -> 1301.86s]  Smart. Thank you for playing this. I've been waiting. I've been waiting for a true announcement
[1301.86s -> 1308.58s]  for No More Heroes 3 to get in here. What's this one? Oh, this is the crazy one. This is
[1308.58s -> 1320.44s]  like the Super Saiyan one. Give me more people to hit. Come on. I think that's it. Yeah. I was
[1321.00s -> 1328.23s]  very disappointed at the one that was announced with a switch. It was that weird top down one.
[1328.23s -> 1337.38s]  I'm not going to say it's a bad game because I didn't even played it, but it might be worth
[1337.38s -> 1347.22s]  playing. I heard it's bad. I heard I didn't hear it was bad. I just heard it was not great.
[1348.10s -> 1357.93s]  I heard it was very passable. Very passable in huge underline under the word very.
[1362.01s -> 1367.69s]  Not perfect equals bad. No, no. I just didn't hear it. I didn't hear fantastic things about
[1367.69s -> 1372.57s]  it, which doesn't matter. I'll probably play it. I'm going to do two. This is the start. No
[1372.57s -> 1380.23s]  More Heroes 1 and No More Heroes 2 at least will be on this channel very soon. I love these fucking
[1380.23s -> 1395.00s]  games. Oh yeah. Right. I can, I can actually do a dodge roll. Oh, he's got a gun. I can block
[1395.00s -> 1410.38s]  the bullets though, right? Yeah. Another one. That slot machine comes in handy so many times.
[1411.10s -> 1421.19s]  Playing No More Heroes 2 so we can see you fail the cooking mini-game. You better believe it. I
[1421.19s -> 1432.12s]  think you want a lot of combos too in this game. If I remember. Oh, I just fucking, that guy just
[1432.44s -> 1435.64s]  shit. Yeah. Okay. You, you can. That's right. That's right. That's right. All right.
[1436.52s -> 1458.39s]  Anymore? When are you going to play No More Heroes 1? Uh, now? Today? You're going to fight the secret
[1458.39s -> 1473.90s]  boss? Um, I don't even really remember what that is. Does it work? Can I like answer the phone?
[1476.23s -> 1489.94s]  Will it come through the Wii mode? It's not coming through the Wii mode. Shit. I have to turn on
[1489.94s -> 1510.12s]  subtitles. Oh no. Uh, okay. Sounds good. Pretty cool. Is it in the options? I don't, actually,
[1510.12s -> 1519.54s]  I don't think I can do that right now. This is a prank call. Go into the Wii menu. Broken Wii mode.
[1519.54s -> 1524.50s]  Wait. No, no. I, I, I, this is being emulated. Press home. No, no, no. It's not. This is not real.
[1525.22s -> 1550.30s]  This is emulation. All right. Let me turn on the subtitles. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,
[1550.78s -> 1581.93s]  guys, guys, relax, guys, guys, relax, guys, relax. It's not a burnt coffee. That wasn't a piece of
[1581.93s -> 1588.90s]  paper. But hold on. Now that I got this here, let me see if I can just get it. I'm curious.
[1588.90s -> 1606.17s]  I don't know if I want to fuck with it. Let me see. No, I don't want to fuck with it. I got it
[1606.17s -> 1612.90s]  working. I don't want to fuck with it. You have to wink. Well, we'll just turn on the, here we go.
[1612.90s -> 1623.62s]  Here. See? There. Problem solved. Speaker is on. It, it don't matter. Look, there's subtitles now.
[1623.62s -> 1629.24s]  I, I, I will read the subtitles. There's no, nobody has 75,000 points. Turn the speaker off.
[1630.71s -> 1658.25s]  Oh, what am I doing? I can just turn it off. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look what
[1658.25s -> 1671.93s]  I got for Christmas. All right, let's go. Awful hair. I'm getting a haircut like tomorrow anyways.
[1671.93s -> 1685.06s]  Don't relax. There's the save point. You guys have seen me with my Wii U. I, I, what are you talking
[1685.06s -> 1701.13s]  about? We already went over this yesterday. I've, I've shared photos of me with my Wii U. I wasn't
[1701.13s -> 1708.87s]  here yesterday. Fuck. I'm sorry. All right, let's get some help. Uh, what does this thing do? Oh,
[1708.87s -> 1715.08s]  it's a new move. Right. That's the, you unlock moves. I forgot. Travis, do you remember those
[1715.08s -> 1722.92s]  golden days in Calgary? The path of pro wrestling that you have long forgotten. If even a fragment
[1722.92s -> 1727.64s]  of the spirit of a wrestler remains in your blood, remember the first suplex that your master taught
[1727.64s -> 1737.53s]  you. Yes, that's right. The darkness piercing. Front neck chancery drop. You remembered an old
[1737.53s -> 1757.62s]  wrestling move. Look, it's easy to miss. Trading card number five. Save game. Travis the suplex.
[1760.10s -> 1766.54s]  Yeah, don't worry. There's no, you don't see anything. Those of you that want to tell me TOS,
[1766.54s -> 1780.44s]  Death Stranding did this and everything's fine. Look, there's literally like
[1781.80s -> 1798.68s]  six minute long shower scenes with Sam Porter Bridges. I think I'll be all right. Did you say
[1798.68s -> 1810.74s]  poop? Uh, you did. All right, we're good. Are you guys ready? Are you ready? Are you ready to see
[1810.74s -> 1826.33s]  like the real game? Let's go. Remember, this is on hard. No, it's not. I know. I'm just saying
[1826.33s -> 1837.80s]  that's what people think. I'm cool. Beautiful, you say? Paid for with the lives of many.
[1838.52s -> 1847.50s]  When you have the strength to take life for yourself. Pretty good red blend. I am free of
[1847.50s -> 1854.30s]  desire. So long as I had the scenery to look upon. Imagine having a pool 10 feet away from a beach.
[1856.57s -> 1864.26s]  You're the one leaving in a body bag. I'll only say this once more. Leave here now.
[1866.10s -> 1875.43s]  Melee. You obviously don't know me. You don't get it. Do you? Hey, you know what paradise is,
[1875.43s -> 1882.87s]  right? Paradise. This is paradise. The place where dreams are fulfilled. You don't know me.
[1882.87s -> 1891.27s]  Well, you've had your dream old man. Time to wake up. This is no paradise. All right, then what is it?
[1891.27s -> 1898.71s]  It's a place to die. Whoa, covered in tattoos. I'm glad you and I are on the same page here.
[1898.71s -> 1905.56s]  What kind of lightsaber do you have? That's this game. That was all it was cool. You have no idea,
[1905.56s -> 1915.80s]  do you? What a pity. You make an old, arrogant, crude little shits like you come around from time
[1915.80s -> 1929.21s]  to time. Listen well, young one. The wall is high, higher than you will ever know. Ultimate sacrifice
[1931.77s -> 1940.38s]  now draw. Yeah, you can take that to your grave. No, I got, I got, I got Luke's
[1940.38s -> 1943.42s]  lightsaber. You can't fight me with that shit. Here we go.
[1943.42s -> 1957.77s]  This count. I feel as if I'm looking at my future self. Make a box, big ass box.
[1961.77s -> 1969.69s]  Trusting nutrition is counting every calorie. A team of hot yoga instructors, nurses,
[1970.33s -> 1972.25s]  and
[1976.15s -> 1976.95s]  that shit out of here.
[1995.53s -> 1999.05s]  That'll be my life. I thirst for selflessness.
[1999.61s -> 2007.45s]  I'm killed by young rookies like me. This is how it goes down. And for the old
[2014.17s -> 2015.69s]  I realize there's really nothing here.
[2030.41s -> 2033.45s]  Yes, there's this sense of doing running down.
[2036.57s -> 2046.98s]  He's still fucking talking. I need to get rid of it before I bail. Instinct. Ow.
[2054.25s -> 2057.77s]  Fuck, he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill me. He's got me to combo. All right, slow down.
[2058.65s -> 2064.70s]  My battery, my battery, my battery's dead. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2069.13s -> 2080.31s]  Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[2089.22s -> 2096.62s]  I got it. It's all up high for that one. Get it again, super flex.
[2103.40s -> 2115.08s]  Oh god, which one's the real one? One in the middle? It's one in the middle.
[2115.40s -> 2134.14s]  Pass it. That's the right one. No, it's this one here. God damn it.
[2142.68s -> 2148.28s]  He doesn't know. Well, I actually don't know. I don't remember.
[2150.60s -> 2152.20s]  If I take like two or three more hits, I'm gonna die.
[2179.62s -> 2192.84s]  First boss. Why am I reading chat right now? Leave me alone. All right, I need battery.
[2192.92s -> 2195.10s]  Wait till he swings.
[2207.30s -> 2209.46s]  I need help. Well, I gotta get help. I think there's one in here.
[2213.27s -> 2214.39s]  Wasn't very much, but it's enough.
[2228.60s -> 2248.60s]  Yeah. Fuck, I just dodged. Easy. Just don't die. I'll be fine.
[2252.74s -> 2274.18s]  How many hits is that? Dodge around it. I didn't even need to do that. What the fuck am I doing?
[2280.22s -> 2291.38s]  Cut. See you later. Completed the tutorial. Great job. That's the easiest thing in the whole game.
[2295.29s -> 2309.75s]  The moment I've been waiting for, the name Holy Sword is now yours. You're joking, right?
[2309.75s -> 2315.75s]  I don't care about titles or power. I just want to be number one. Then master the ways of the
[2315.75s -> 2331.98s]  assassin. Was this before Bayonetta? I think this is the first like real violent game that came out
[2331.98s -> 2346.01s]  on the Wii, right? There it is. Rank B. That's all right. I'll take BBB. Total money. Cool.
[2357.62s -> 2367.21s]  Open the chest, please. Wii Sports was really violent. Um, no, that's maximum vitality
[2367.21s -> 2372.10s]  increase. Nice. No, you're right. Wii Sports was very violent. You know how many people
[2372.10s -> 2376.02s]  accidentally hit their friends in the face with the Wii mode? That's the first time motion controls
[2376.02s -> 2381.43s]  took off at all. You know how many TVs were fucking shattered? You know how many accidental elbows
[2381.43s -> 2387.35s]  and like to your little brother's face they were? This is probably the most violent console to ever
[2387.35s -> 2397.08s]  exist or ever will exist. How many ER trips from 2006 to like 2010 existed because of the Wii?
[2398.65s -> 2415.16s]  That data is somewhere. Is that all the uh, yeah. Nice kill, Travis. I didn't think you had it in you.
[2416.12s -> 2426.34s]  It was rather exciting. Congratulations. There she is. You are now ranked 10th. 10th, huh? What? Do I
[2426.34s -> 2434.74s]  get anything? How about some cash? That should help you pay the bills. I'm not feeling the sense of
[2434.74s -> 2439.86s]  accomplishment that I should have. So I just got to do this a few more times, right?
[2440.50s -> 2444.90s]  If you so choose, yes. Ten more times, Travis. And you will keep your promise?
[2445.62s -> 2453.30s]  There is nothing the association cannot do. And if I refuse? As the 10th ranked assassin,
[2453.30s -> 2461.06s]  you are now a target for those who want to replace you anytime, anywhere. Number 11 could be right
[2461.06s -> 2468.26s]  around the corner, ready to put a knife in your eye. So what you're telling me is that I got to
[2468.26s -> 2475.54s]  continue fighting. There's no way out of this. You set me up, bitch. Quit your bitching and get with
[2475.54s -> 2483.46s]  the program. There's only one road out of here. No turning back. Okay, how about this? If I become
[2483.46s -> 2496.25s]  number one, will you do it with me? Maybe. Maybe not. Come on, just once. I did it.
[2500.04s -> 2513.29s]  Ranking list, marvelous. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, death metal.
[2513.85s -> 2529.99s]  Travis touchdown takes over death metal. It was just Galaga this whole time.
[2532.28s -> 2535.96s]  I believe this is where the world opens up. And yes, it is an open world game.
[2535.96s -> 2559.59s]  Rank 10. Explore the house. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff here. It's time for chores.
[2562.20s -> 2578.22s]  Time for chores. The open part, open world part, sucks. Yes, it does. Anytime. Gotcha. He swallowed
[2578.22s -> 2595.54s]  the gargle. Didn't wipe. It didn't and swallowed the gargle. All right, let's do, let's go to the
[2595.54s -> 2604.74s]  closet. What do I got? You can change clothes in there too. All right, go sunglasses. I only have
[2604.74s -> 2614.94s]  the defaults. I think you can buy better ones. T-shirts. Just go shirtless. I don't, I don't want
[2615.58s -> 2632.60s]  Kingdom Hearts box art, whatever this is. Default, default. That looks good. Let's go to the drawer.
[2633.40s -> 2639.51s]  What's in here? I think you can look at your cards. Yeah, this is the beam katanas. This is
[2639.51s -> 2649.29s]  where you keep your lightsabers. You have blood berry. Wanted at a net auction. A beam katana
[2649.29s -> 2661.56s]  wanted an auction. Okay. What about map? Let's see. Santa destroy guide. Yeah, you can take a look at
[2661.56s -> 2671.48s]  stuff here. Is the burger suplex. Burger suplex. A burger joint with a distinctive sign. There's
[2671.48s -> 2678.44s]  the house. Here's a suplex pizza. Atomic drop ward. Santa destroy high school. Bodyslam beach.
[2679.08s -> 2691.26s]  Yeah, it's open world. You don't skip. I've skipped what? All right, let's go play. Let's play with a
[2691.26s -> 2709.30s]  cat. Here we go. Yeah, you can play with the cat in this game. Get it. I'm gonna get that thing.
[2709.30s -> 2724.25s]  I'm gonna get it. All right, we got cards. What are the cards we got? Let's try a card. Mask of
[2724.25s -> 2732.25s]  the Legendary Wrestler El Extremo. Yeah, they're just wrestlers. I did get all the cards in that
[2732.25s -> 2738.66s]  level. That's cool. Look at this room. All right, what about the fridge? What's in the fridge?
[2739.46s -> 2753.00s]  It's a mini fridge. Was it beer and pizza? All right, what about TV? No More Heroes. The first
[2753.00s -> 2757.96s]  trailer of No More Heroes. Should we watch it? I think we already saw this. Did we see this?
[2758.84s -> 2781.45s]  He's got a bad nerd neck. This is the trailer for the, this is the Helter Skelter. Yeah,
[2782.25s -> 2787.29s]  Skelter Helter or whatever his name is. Yeah, you don't see this fight.
[2802.92s -> 2814.36s]  Helter Skelter. It is Helter Skelter. Is this spoilers? Is it? No, this is the trailer for,
[2814.36s -> 2825.77s]  this is like the official licensed Nintendo trailer for the game. Actual spoilers.
[2826.57s -> 2835.02s]  Hear the lullaby? Rest in peace, baby. Are there spoilers? All right, no, we won't,
[2835.02s -> 2843.21s]  we won't watch it then. Not spoilers. It's all right. You already saw it. It's not. Why?
[2843.53s -> 2854.41s]  I don't know. Fucking one guy. All right, let's go. Let's play the worst part of the entire video
[2854.41s -> 2863.11s]  game. But it being pulled through PC might actually be better because this is the segment that is the
[2863.11s -> 2871.16s]  reason why I didn't play it on the Wii. This right here is the reason why. What you're about to see.
[2882.97s -> 2899.80s]  It ain't bad right now. It ain't bad. All right, back up. You watched a shitty Coke ad for this.
[2899.80s -> 2903.53s]  For what? Well, I guess that just answered you. Yeah, like for what?
[2904.49s -> 2910.09s]  The next fight has been arranged. You don't have a lot of time. So I'll just tell you what you need
[2910.09s -> 2919.29s]  to know. The ninth ranked assassin is currently Dr. Peace. A doctor? Actually, a detective. A
[2919.29s -> 2925.05s]  dirty and unscrupulous detective with plenty of dark secrets about him. Illegal investigations,
[2925.05s -> 2930.73s]  illicit sales, black marketing. He is your one stop shop for marketing illegal goods.
[2931.37s -> 2936.09s]  And on top of that, he is a trained assassin. He's been doing some work for the mafia.
[2936.09s -> 2941.61s]  And before you know it, he's up there ranked ninth on the list. To be frank, he's good.
[2941.61s -> 2947.05s]  You won't stand a chance against him. You're as good as dead. What's it going to be cowboy?
[2947.05s -> 2956.73s]  Put me in coach. All right, please transfer 150,000 LB dollars. What? 150,000 LBs?
[2956.89s -> 2962.65s]  Your entry fee, my overhead costs. Don't tell me that you were not expecting so many zeros on
[2962.65s -> 2967.53s]  that price or that I am ripping you off or some shit. We have an elite staff in the thousands.
[2968.17s -> 2975.77s]  150,000 dollars. Okay, I gotcha. But you really think I got that kind of dough on me? What the
[2975.77s -> 2981.77s]  hell am I supposed to do? You are supposed to do your job. You've been hired to kill someone. So
[2981.77s -> 2986.65s]  just do it and quit your whining. Plus on the job, turning in would be good for you.
[2986.65s -> 2992.17s]  If you're interested, I can introduce you to an agent. Coconut time. But really,
[2992.17s -> 2999.05s]  they're racers. I'll tell you where it is later. I'm running late for my facial. Catch up later,
[2999.05s -> 3015.69s]  Kay. What? No. That's the scream. There it is. What a distinctive voice. You can take on assassin
[3015.69s -> 3019.85s]  missions from Kay Entertainment, earn enough money to enter the next ranking battle.
[3020.73s -> 3029.14s]  Yeah, so there's, here's your open world. Not much of an open world. It's kind of just a map
[3029.14s -> 3036.46s]  to go do things. But yeah, we'll just do this. Make some money. Go do the facial. I can't.
[3039.66s -> 3045.86s]  Members only, we only need high ranking assassins. If you don't have an introduction
[3045.86s -> 3050.42s]  ticket, please leave now. We only offer work to those who have proven themselves as hard workers.
[3050.50s -> 3062.66s]  May you find your true path. I'm not good enough. Now, apparently not skilled.
[3064.26s -> 3069.14s]  The job center is now open. You can take on part-time job missions from the job center.
[3069.78s -> 3074.66s]  Earn enough money to enter the next battle. Press the one button to call your bike.
[3074.66s -> 3079.54s]  Sit next to your bike and press the A button to get on. Yep, yep, yep. Press two to change the
[3079.54s -> 3088.74s]  mini maps display. Let's get the bike here. All right. Yeah, you have to actually go do
[3090.87s -> 3098.14s]  just part-time. Who the fuck is this? All right. Give me a sec. I have to let Otto,
[3100.06s -> 3135.37s]  let Otto out of the room. Hold on. He wants to get out. You can't be in here. Well,
[3135.37s -> 3138.65s]  then he wanted to get out. He was like, let me out, Cheruby. And I was like, okay.
[3141.35s -> 3148.94s]  So he can leave. He's, he's free to roam where he pleases. All right, let's go get on a bike.
[3149.74s -> 3162.89s]  Here's the real test. It didn't run so much better. Let's go check out the jobs. I mean,
[3162.89s -> 3168.65s]  it's still pretty janky, but those of you that played the original actual original hardware,
[3169.94s -> 3177.96s]  this was horrible. This is way better. Yeah, like by probably by 10,000%.
[3179.08s -> 3203.93s]  Let's go to the job center. Get off. The sharp turns are fun though. Yeah, they can be.
[3204.65s -> 3212.04s]  How much money do I have right now? There's no blood in the Japanese version.
[3213.35s -> 3218.47s]  Really? Why are you here, third raider? This is a place where third raiders get together.
[3219.19s -> 3224.23s]  So you're a member. Well, I'll teach you some good stuff. All first raiders in the world were
[3224.23s -> 3230.23s]  once third raiders. So third class is the first step up the ladder. First class. Your life will
[3230.23s -> 3235.59s]  change if you work here. I'll tell you one more thing. How to third raiders become first raiders.
[3235.59s -> 3240.71s]  It's easy. They worked their butts off till they were puking blood and then work some more.
[3241.27s -> 3247.34s]  Want to be a first raider? All right, just work hard. You chalk up jobs to survive in this town.
[3247.34s -> 3251.74s]  I'll hook you up with some more work if you do this job well. The job has been posted on the
[3251.74s -> 3260.25s]  golden board. Just work hard. Here it is. Coconut collector. Collect coconuts perform a rolling
[3260.25s -> 3267.48s]  sobat against a palm tree to make coconuts fall. Here we go. $2,000 for each delivery.
[3274.89s -> 3279.93s]  Yeah, this part of the game sucks, but I'm going to enjoy it because it's nostalgia. Take it over.
[3280.57s -> 3296.82s]  Okay, the client head to the client point marked on the map. Let's go. I think, yeah, if I smacked
[3296.82s -> 3303.62s]  the weed, if I, I think I can go faster if I double tap and then like, that's jump.
[3308.54s -> 3319.24s]  Just like in GTA. Here we are. We're here. You can drift too. Yeah. Wow, Jeremy, this is such an
[3319.24s -> 3325.77s]  interesting Minecraft house. Thanks, mom. The unspoken rules of Santa Destroy are okay,
[3325.77s -> 3330.25s]  but the coconuts of Santa Destroy are more my thing. Coconuts from these parts fetch a high
[3330.25s -> 3336.25s]  price. This town is built on coconuts. Coconuts are worth more than human life. Coconuts are
[3336.25s -> 3343.08s]  God, so gather them now. Gather coconuts and give them to the storekeeper. Use combo attacks on the
[3343.08s -> 3348.04s]  palm trees to make the coconuts fall. Press the A button repeatedly when carrying coconuts to walk
[3348.04s -> 3375.85s]  faster. Here we go. Get the coconut. How many can you hold? One or two? Three? Go, go, go, go,
[3375.85s -> 3394.10s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. That's the way. Any more in this tree? No, no, no, I gotta go.
[3394.10s -> 3407.30s]  This is a strand game. It's easy. Why would that? That's not, that makes no sense. All right,
[3407.30s -> 3418.31s]  I gotta get three at a time. Get in front of it, please. Oh my God. What the fuck is going on?
[3418.31s -> 3439.22s]  Why can I hit that one? What? No, don't pick this one up. I want the, whatever. That's the way.
[3441.91s -> 3451.58s]  I want to get like two or three of them to drop. Let's do this. No, there we go. Grab them.
[3453.99s -> 3473.78s]  It's easy. I get 2000 bucks for each one of these. At least I'm good at running. I'm still
[3473.78s -> 3479.70s]  got a full minute. More than 15 or 10 is good. Okay. Nothing on that one. Nothing on that one.
[3480.26s -> 3507.43s]  Nothing on that one. Come on. Come on. Coconut brain. I should be able to do two more deliveries.
[3521.22s -> 3524.58s]  The other side, the closer trees. Right. I see. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're
[3524.58s -> 3551.38s]  right. I can get one more coconut. Okay. I got 11. That's like a shitload of money. $22,000.
[3552.34s -> 3557.24s]  That's a gold rank. That's not like a silver rank. It's got a gold rank. I can get platinum rank.
[3557.24s -> 3561.24s]  I'll try. I'm gonna do that one again. Hey, you third rater. I've got another job for you.
[3561.24s -> 3565.48s]  Something a little shadier, perhaps, but work all the same. I've sent an introduction ticket
[3565.48s -> 3570.12s]  to my associate. The road becoming a first rater is long and hard. Get your ass in gear.
[3571.08s -> 3577.37s]  Hey, you third grader. You want to be a... That doesn't make any sense. Hey, you third grader.
[3577.37s -> 3583.61s]  Want to be a first grader? Oh, nice. Okay. An assassination mission. A brand new free
[3583.61s -> 3595.67s]  fight mission can now be selected. Ah. Time to kick some ass. Free fights suck.
[3596.63s -> 3602.46s]  It's better than carrying coconuts. There's a list of jobs in my current rank. Here we go.
[3602.46s -> 3607.82s]  Assassination gig one. Pizza butt. Chain restaurant pizza butt plans to open up in Santa
[3607.82s -> 3615.38s]  Destroy to crush their plans. Kill pizza butts CEO. Or a snake haul. Kill until you die. Mission
[3615.38s -> 3634.66s]  ends when your life runs out. Two thousand thirty thousand dollars. Do this one. I could do this
[3634.66s -> 3642.10s]  one clean. Kill someone. Thirty thousand dollars. Collect eleven coconuts. Twenty two thousand
[3642.10s -> 3676.78s]  dollars. Yeah. All right. Speed it up. I didn't even hit that guy. These corners. You can't just
[3676.78s -> 3689.70s]  turn on it down. Let me just try and hold. Yeah. Z is boost. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. It is boost.
[3689.70s -> 3703.67s]  You got it. Uh, where is it? Right here? On the other side? I don't think I can jump over this.
[3704.39s -> 3724.02s]  Can I? Shit. I gotta go down there. Oh, right. That's how you do it. That's how you do it. You
[3724.02s -> 3732.71s]  go really fast and you can instantly stop. I forget how I just did that. Oh, shit. Okay.
[3733.67s -> 3741.98s]  I wish I had some sourdough pizza. That sounds like bad. Is that actually good?
[3748.26s -> 3755.05s]  Sourdough pizza? Wouldn't it be too chewy and weird? All right, let's go.
[3756.09s -> 3761.32s]  This is my favorite part of the whole game. That part.
[3761.32s -> 3764.89s]  Three, two, one.
[3768.71s -> 3786.54s]  Just fucking burger boy. No, no, no. Don't burger boy. Get them all. Oh, let's do it sideways.
[3786.54s -> 3820.89s]  God damn it. I would have hit like five people. Shit. Guns at me. I have 10 seconds. I gotta go.
[3824.01s -> 3827.05s]  Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3827.05s -> 3839.64s]  I didn't forget about the time. I forgot about the time. All right. Let's do it again. Let's
[3839.64s -> 3847.03s]  do it again. Let's do it again. Let's do it again. Oh, shit. I forgot. I forgot. You have to go get
[3847.03s -> 3851.35s]  you. You have to... I forgot. I forgot. That's the worst part of all this game. You have to go get
[3851.35s -> 3855.67s]  it again. Okay. You gotta go back and get it again. Fuck. I forgot about this part. That part. This
[3855.67s -> 3870.34s]  part sucked. As far as the worst. You actually have to go get the mission again. Jesus Christ.
[3877.58s -> 3882.22s]  Damn it. I forgot about that. Yeah. You can't, you can't mess around. If I had only swung left to
[3882.22s -> 3891.48s]  right, if I was able to swing left to right, that would have been perfect. I'll get it this time.
[3892.20s -> 3911.45s]  I think I hit that lady, I guess. Kick the dumpsters? Oh, yeah. That's right. You can't
[3911.45s -> 3922.17s]  kick the dumpsters. What side is this on? This side. Oh, shit. I almost had it. All right. You
[3922.17s -> 3940.17s]  gotta, I gotta be real quick with this. You only have 30 seconds. Welcome, Travis. Uh-huh. Pizza
[3940.17s -> 3951.94s]  butt. Let's go. I bet you can't do this in 30 seconds. I will do this in 30 seconds. I promise.
[3952.58s -> 3960.81s]  Don't forget to use the charge attacks. Uh, do I have those on? Do you have to unlock those?
[3961.45s -> 4001.56s]  Let's do it. Straight down here. Down, down, down, down, down, down, down. Pizza butt. All right.
[4001.56s -> 4012.98s]  This is the one. Better ingredients, better pizza. Pizza butt. 30 seconds. Don't fuck around. Go
[4012.98s -> 4032.71s]  right in. Go right in and kill everybody. Hurry and quick. Get in. Go. That's what I wanted. Right
[4032.71s -> 4061.03s]  there. This is the one. Left to right, left to right, left to right. Ah. German suplex right in
[4061.03s -> 4076.60s]  his neck. Dead. Just kill the dude? Yeah, but if you, if you kill, you get bonuses if you kill more
[4076.60s -> 4084.01s]  people. I got a bronze for that because I didn't kill everybody. If you got time, kill everybody.
[4089.61s -> 4093.77s]  You have enough money for the entrance fee for the next ranking battle. Make the payment at an ATM.
[4094.57s -> 4114.36s]  I got $158,000. Buy shirts and stuff. Yeah, but one of the things that happens to you in this game,
[4114.36s -> 4120.36s]  in this whole series, is you'll have enough money to do the next entrance to the assassination
[4121.32s -> 4124.90s]  that you'll buy like five t-shirts and have to collect coconuts for two hours.
[4125.70s -> 4153.56s]  I don't even hate you. Do it anyways. $2,000 on that one. $2,000 on that one. Why would you throw
[4153.80s -> 4163.72s]  $2,000 away? Basketball? What is that? Found a lovikov ball. What the hell? What is that?
[4163.72s -> 4187.34s]  I don't remember that. My bike. Dumpster diving. Yeah. It's a Japanese game, right? So that's,
[4187.90s -> 4196.82s]  that's like 20 bucks. Is this? All right, let's make the deposit.
[4197.62s -> 4228.23s]  Is he actually using a Wii controller? Yes, I am. $150,000 deposit. Why am I using a Wii
[4228.23s -> 4236.65s]  controller? Because I have to. This game has like a gyro feature that has the up and down and left
[4236.65s -> 4248.46s]  and right swinging and you just hit the mic. Just throw a wad into the ATM. All right, I'm good.
[4249.26s -> 4272.65s]  Can you please turn up your mic volume? Uh, it should be up. Is that better? Can you hear
[4272.65s -> 4282.22s]  me now? Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Your mic is fine. That's just, I just got hurt.
[4282.22s -> 4287.93s]  All right, where do I have to go? I was looking to chat. Get back to the house, right? And answer
[4287.93s -> 4300.44s]  the phone. My home is inside of get out of the way. Yeah, it's like my, my, my house is the hotel.
[4300.44s -> 4317.77s]  I forgot. I know the mic isn't muted. Yeah. Bring, bring that shit back to like 2013 Twitch.
[4318.65s -> 4336.46s]  Oh wait, what's this? Preparing. Oh, it's not open yet, right? It's not open yet. Why did I just go
[4336.46s -> 4351.82s]  in the fuck? Look at chat. You're muted. Wow. Oh yeah. You want me to prove I'm not muted?
[4354.55s -> 4358.15s]  You guys could be like, Oh, just don't say anything. Just don't react to anything that he says.
[4358.15s -> 4366.22s]  Really? You think you can keep that up? Hmm. I wonder if you can keep that up.
[4377.51s -> 4397.46s]  The Witcher three is not a good game. See, I told you. I told you just say something.
[4398.34s -> 4404.41s]  We're actually, that's wrong. You're wrong. Yeah. You're not a very good at a,
[4404.41s -> 4422.89s]  you're not a very good stealth artist. I never even played the Witcher three.
[4423.61s -> 4426.95s]  I know it's supposed to be legendary, but let me tell you something.
[4427.75s -> 4432.63s]  I played the Witcher one and it didn't get it. And I was like, Oh, this is kind of cool. I guess.
[4433.59s -> 4440.30s]  And gave up on, I think it was the Witcher two after two hours of playing it because every time
[4440.30s -> 4444.30s]  you opened a door in the Witcher two, you had to sit at a loading screen for two to three straight
[4444.30s -> 4452.81s]  minutes every single time. So I was like, I want to play this game. I think eventually they fixed
[4452.81s -> 4460.41s]  all that, but I never played them. Really. I played a little bit of them. I got it. Maybe
[4460.41s -> 4467.34s]  I got to go back and give it a chance because I've heard they are fantastic. Save the cat.
[4467.34s -> 4486.34s]  The cat is fine. Wait, there's other, what are the controls? Oh, any button just, we're just like
[4486.34s -> 4494.55s]  vibing right now. Right. Witcher one didn't age well. And that was, that was, that was back when
[4494.55s -> 4501.69s]  it was almost like a rhythm game, right? Wasn't the combat, you had to click, try to click, click,
[4501.69s -> 4507.42s]  click, click. It was weird. It was, it was different. You had to like time your clicks, almost
[4507.42s -> 4516.18s]  like it was a rhythm game. I remember, I remember not hating that though. I thought it was interesting.
[4516.98s -> 4529.88s]  All right. Let me get healed. Three's not like that. Yeah, I know. Maybe one day I'll give it all
[4529.88s -> 4535.38s]  a chance and play it all. Cause I, you know, I don't want to look, I don't want to be one of
[4535.38s -> 4541.78s]  those bandwagon assholes that plays cyberpunk and goes, wow, what an incredible studio. Oh,
[4541.78s -> 4546.10s]  I'm such a fan. Been such a fan for so long. What a great studio. I love this studio.
[4547.58s -> 4551.42s]  And like I played 10 minutes of the Witcher and I was like, I just can't, I don't like this.
[4552.22s -> 4561.54s]  What's the studio? What's this timing stuff? Whoa. Cyberpunk. Wow. Who made this? Oh,
[4562.26s -> 4572.04s]  all right. I need to go. No, I'm not putting a shirt on and nothing else I can do. It didn't
[4572.04s -> 4577.29s]  unlock anything. I'm going to save it though. Is this, it's freaking me out. Is it weird that I
[4577.29s -> 4588.23s]  have to go to the bathroom every time I see him do this? Like I, it makes me need to pee.
[4589.11s -> 4607.78s]  That's weird. Do I have any message or anything on the telephone? All right, let's go. Bye Gene.
[4608.74s -> 4622.68s]  Is this game on steam? That is not. Unfortunately, I don't know why. Ranking battle nine is now open.
[4623.77s -> 4628.73s]  Uh, so this is grasshopper, grasshopper and Ubisoft, right? Ubisoft, I believe,
[4628.73s -> 4638.98s]  has the rights to this game. This is an Ubisoft published game with no more heroes three coming
[4638.98s -> 4650.02s]  out. You think that they would, I'm surprised there's not a no, no more heroes and no more
[4650.02s -> 4656.73s]  heroes to remaster coming out before, right? I feel like they would have to do that because they
[4656.73s -> 4661.93s]  did a port for PS3. It was one game. It was this one. They ported it to PS3. They didn't do the
[4661.93s -> 4666.74s]  second one. The second one's still only on Wii. It's just kind of all over the place. Like it
[4666.74s -> 4673.06s]  would be nice to have it in one spot that was remastered. I think they were actually talking
[4673.06s -> 4677.54s]  about remastering them or porting them or something, but it was like an off-handed random comment in
[4677.54s -> 4683.94s]  an interview that I think that Suda did a lot like, like a year ago, right? Like yeah, we would love
[4684.02s -> 4695.69s]  to do that, but it is not like real. Like we're going to do that. I think it would be in their
[4695.69s -> 4709.10s]  best interest though, because some people would buy it. Two is better than one. Two is definitely
[4709.10s -> 4714.50s]  cleaner than one. They fixed all the kind of annoying bullshit that is in this game,
[4715.38s -> 4722.23s]  but I still think this game's really good. I still like this one. All right, here we go.
[4723.03s -> 4743.74s]  Listen. Yeah, they're all good. Yeah. Dr. Peace. There it is. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[4744.70s -> 4748.30s]  I knew that was going to happen. I knew it was going to happen. Kill him.
[4756.15s -> 4770.81s]  You knew it was going to happen at least once. All right. These guys are all baseball players.
[4770.81s -> 4782.26s]  I remember when I wasn't walking low, he would break. Two had better bosses, but the story was
[4782.26s -> 4807.32s]  bland. Looks like the story in three might be pretty cool. If that trailer was any indicator,
[4807.32s -> 4813.43s]  it's going to be fucking crazy. Although the story, does the story really matter that much
[4813.43s -> 4820.46s]  in a game like this? You know what I'm saying? It's just fun and just has, it's just an interesting
[4820.46s -> 4830.07s]  concept. It does. Well, to an extent, I would say, yeah, but you're an assassin. You're climbing
[4830.07s -> 4850.26s]  the assassin ladder. That's all the info that I need to have fun. He's backtracking. Wait, what?
[4851.78s -> 4856.90s]  Because I don't think the story matters for me in this game. How's that backtracking? I still
[4856.90s -> 4869.48s]  stand by that. Backtracking. Oh, backtracking Barry at it again. I don't think the story matters in
[4869.48s -> 4874.04s]  this game. Looks over at chat. Fucking, what are you talking about? You idiot. Stupid. Whoa,
[4874.04s -> 4878.44s]  is he serious? No way. Oh, I'm going to unfollow. Well, you know, the thing is,
[4879.16s -> 4883.40s]  if you think the story is cool, then that's fine. But I don't, I mean, I think the story is cool.
[4883.40s -> 4895.82s]  I just don't, I mean, for me personally, in my personal opinion, unfollowed and reported.
[4896.78s -> 4904.47s]  Wait, did I get everything? I mean, just the story in general, I'm not going to be backtracking
[4904.47s -> 4909.91s]  Barry anymore. All right. I love this game's atmosphere and this game's setting and this game's
[4909.91s -> 4913.67s]  whole thing that's going on. I don't, like, I'm not going to, I'm not going to be backtracking
[4913.67s -> 4923.98s]  Barry anymore. I'm just telling you that I love Travis. I keep backpedaling. I misspoke. I really
[4923.98s -> 4930.23s]  did. Let me just, let me correct my gap. This game is fucking awesome. And the setting, fuck I'm,
[4930.23s -> 4939.13s]  this is like my favorite game made for the Wii. Like one of my favorite games,
[4939.13s -> 4952.79s]  one of my favorite franchises. What am I supposed to say? Get out of here.
[4960.20s -> 4979.85s]  Now fuck, can I turn up the music? No, I can't. If I turn the music down and I turn it back up,
[4979.85s -> 4996.26s]  I'll be backtracking on that too. Oh, this is, I remember this part. You got to hit the ball,
[4996.98s -> 5003.38s]  controls, hold up the Wiimote to prepare the beam katana, swing the Wiimote like a bat,
[5003.38s -> 5007.78s]  hit the ball and send it flying. The strength of your swing will affect the speed of the ball.
[5007.78s -> 5021.85s]  Hit the balls to defeat enemies. Three balls will be thrown. I thought I was going to get it first
[5021.85s -> 5035.78s]  try. I'm scared to do it hard because I don't want to hit you. I'm going to pee my pants.
[5036.58s -> 5052.78s]  I don't know what it is about peeing, but I'll do it at the same point. Backpedaling. No,
[5052.78s -> 5057.34s]  all right. You know that I like a game when like I won't go to the bathroom.
[5058.14s -> 5084.98s]  I'm like a fucking three-year-old. That's a lot of money. Yes, I am. Get him.
[5091.37s -> 5095.69s]  Show off the charge attack. I don't think, I don't, I'm not sure I have it. I'll try.
[5096.65s -> 5117.70s]  Does it have to be a full battery? Yeah, I'm not sure I have it. Oh, I do. Oh, it took a lot of
[5117.70s -> 5141.13s]  battery. Oh, fuck. That's actually pretty cool. Losing a lot of battery. Nice. It does, this is a
[5141.13s -> 5148.47s]  lot of battery though. Do some wrestling finishers. I only have one wrestling finisher at the moment.
[5148.87s -> 5168.06s]  Yes. Or I think maybe two. Did I get all the goodies? I believe I did. Turn on the webcam
[5168.06s -> 5207.58s]  for one of those. I'll do it eventually. Get him both. Yes. There he is. Come on, knock him out.
[5213.88s -> 5218.52s]  Low, low, low, high, high, high, high, high, high, high. Boom, bang, boom.
[5219.70s -> 5243.19s]  Boom. Just kill him. Somebody said I should play Lollipop Chainsaw, but here's the problem
[5243.19s -> 5250.31s]  though. I love No More Heroes. Am I going to judge Lollipop Chainsaw unfairly because of how
[5250.31s -> 5258.04s]  much I love these games? I probably will. All right, let's get it out. Let's get in one go.
[5258.84s -> 5273.03s]  Yeah, I know how to do it. I'm standing back for this. Holy shit. I almost just peed. I almost did.
[5273.99s -> 5298.95s]  Oh my God. I almost just peed. I swear to God. Yeah, I'll be right back. That came out. That ball
[5298.95s -> 5470.47s]  was thrown so fast. I got to check. Okay. Damn. All right. He really did pee his pants. No,
[5471.19s -> 5476.09s]  that's not why that took a little while. It's because there was a lot in there.
[5485.27s -> 5490.25s]  Oh, I didn't pee my pants. I would tell you guys that. Do you think I would hold that information
[5490.25s -> 5496.76s]  from you? Of all the strange things you've heard me say, you think me telling you I didn't pee my
[5497.08s -> 5507.11s]  you know, you think I'm going to lie about that? Please don't tell us that.
[5511.21s -> 5515.94s]  All right. Oh yeah. Probably shouldn't. Yeah, I probably shouldn't.
[5531.74s -> 5539.96s]  Backtracking. Oh, all right. This is going to be tricky. Oh, I thought I timed it.
[5540.52s -> 5562.06s]  Oh, damn it. Just tracking. What does that even mean?
[5565.10s -> 5595.96s]  Pee pants, Peter. Relax. Whoa, camera. Oh, I got him. Where am I? What? Oh, shit. I had a chance.
[5596.92s -> 5607.29s]  Proof of peeing your pants. You can't prove somebody peed their pants by
[5607.53s -> 5618.36s]  muting my mic and left the room. Show your pants. But how do you know I didn't change my pants?
[5621.83s -> 5631.64s]  You know, I could have paused to come back with new pants on. I said exactly. Yeah, but
[5633.32s -> 5637.32s]  then why would I need to turn on my webcam and show you my pants? Oh, there's nothing in here.
[5637.88s -> 5638.68s]  I gotta charge this.
[5651.82s -> 5671.93s]  I got one. All right. Stop using all my battery. Get up. What is this? What are you doing?
[5676.39s -> 5681.35s]  All right. You, you. When I look over here sometimes, I see a sea of clickable purple
[5681.35s -> 5711.21s]  links. I get nervous. It's you peeing your pants. No, it's me. I know that. I don't even know. I
[5711.21s -> 5715.77s]  don't have to click it. I know what it is. Let me explain to everybody that keeps putting that
[5715.77s -> 5725.58s]  image in for the last like two or three months. There's such things guys as like mustard and oil
[5725.58s -> 5732.86s]  and eating at a restaurant and putting your finger on your pants after you eat like a pulled pork
[5732.94s -> 5750.12s]  sandwich. Why would I pee my pants? And what? Who cares? No, stop talking about food. This,
[5750.12s -> 5755.02s]  I'm not, this is not going to be an hour and 25 minutes screen. Every time you talk about food,
[5755.02s -> 5767.11s]  it all gets fucked up. No, stop saying no. I got diarrhea last night from the pizza. So I'm not,
[5767.11s -> 5772.92s]  I don't want, that's not going to work. The worst part about this is I don't know if it was the
[5772.92s -> 5801.58s]  pizza or putting the Wiimote in my mouth. True story. Get out of here. Two lightsaber duels.
[5805.83s -> 5820.42s]  Shit, that hurts. Get him boy. Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[5820.42s -> 5826.86s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,
[5826.86s -> 5836.62s]  kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. That's it. I got everything right.
[5851.00s -> 5856.65s]  Psycho. I'm like, cause I was going kill, kill, kill, kill. All right. Let's see if this works.
[5859.85s -> 5867.53s]  Does it, can you guys hear it? Let's find out. Yeah. The moment you step onto the field,
[5867.53s -> 5876.41s]  the fight begins. If you win, you will be ranked ninth. If you lose, well, there's no need to go
[5876.41s -> 5885.77s]  into that. If you pop a breath, hit the restroom, brush your teeth. When you are ready, step inside.
[5886.65s -> 5895.61s]  Your chances of survival are slim, but trust your force and head for the garden of madness.
[5897.54s -> 5905.35s]  Okay. How come I never say anything back? Actual Star Wars game.
[5909.59s -> 5925.53s]  Okay. New move. Coming up. Travis, you've made some progress. I caught the podcast that said
[5925.53s -> 5931.53s]  you're getting your edge back. Do you remember your second suplex? Terrifying trip to the moon,
[5931.53s -> 5940.17s]  the reverse arm salt. You remember no professional wrestling move. Uh, am I going to get full health?
[5941.05s -> 5963.11s]  I think you do. This is an Xbox game. This is a Wii game. Only for the Wii. Well, no, that's not
[5963.11s -> 5968.28s]  true. It is an Xbox game, but that one, it only came out in Japan to the next box. I've been,
[5968.28s -> 5975.13s]  by the way, why? So there's a PS3 remake or remaster of this game and it came out on
[5975.13s -> 5985.38s]  Xbox 360 as well, but only in Japan for 360. Weird. All right. Number nine. Here we go.
[5985.94s -> 6031.08s]  The ballpark.
[6034.33s -> 6039.13s]  Nice set of pipes you got there old man and nice golden guns.
[6051.69s -> 6057.29s]  Courtesy of me and my entry fee. No doubt. My ex-wife called me the other day and I
[6057.29s -> 6062.89s]  met my daughter for the first time in 10 years. We dined at a fancy restaurant.
[6062.89s -> 6067.69s]  One of those that are impossible to get a reservation for. And then afterwards,
[6067.69s -> 6074.73s]  karaoke. Who got you the reservation? The association took care of it. Of course.
[6074.73s -> 6084.84s]  Yes. Fuck my entry fee. $150,000 is not the fact the reservations are hard to get.
[6085.88s -> 6093.24s]  In fact, no one gets reservations. The words reservations only apply only to those outside
[6093.24s -> 6098.92s]  of the circle. It's getting into that circle matters. And the food good.
[6099.88s -> 6110.39s]  Unfortunately, the atmosphere was a facade. Not once did my own daughter look me in the eye.
[6110.39s -> 6117.98s]  This guy's food tasted like blood. You're a junkie for blood, old man.
[6120.79s -> 6124.07s]  Nipples. You just did this there. It's just a bear.
[6125.61s -> 6135.85s]  People like us, we're shocked. You smell blood too, didn't you?
[6135.85s -> 6141.05s]  You got it, old man. And for some reason, I feel this sense of euphoria.
[6144.18s -> 6147.38s]  Don't die on me too quickly. I want to gorge myself.
[6149.30s -> 6152.18s]  This guy shoots. You gotta watch out for the projectiles.
[6153.30s -> 6159.14s]  Man, this is what I live for. Fighting your own kind. Nothing's more gratifying.
[6160.34s -> 6162.02s]  See you on the other side.
[6162.66s -> 6164.82s]  All right, do I have to?
[6174.20s -> 6183.58s]  Not that easy, Travis. All right, here we go. Can I do that? I think I have to block.
[6184.98s -> 6206.38s]  Good music coming up. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Block low, block high. Oh. Block low, block high.
[6207.10s -> 6230.57s]  Block low. Oh, fuck. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[6230.57s -> 6239.98s]  He's not gonna kill me. All right, back up, back up. Wait till he shoots. All right,
[6239.98s -> 6260.30s]  when he goes down to his knees, it's low. Can't block these. All right, I got it.
[6281.94s -> 6293.21s]  More. How many more? Oh, fuck. He's gonna change up. He's gonna go to the next phase
[6293.21s -> 6313.98s]  here in a second. Oh, fuck. I got it. I got it. Get it. Oh, shit. He does more than that.
[6324.39s -> 6350.89s]  All right, I'm fine. I can't knock him down. Jesus Christ.
[6350.89s -> 6385.93s]  Get him. Back it up. I need health. I'm fine. Oh, my fucking God, I have no battery. I have
[6385.93s -> 6429.53s]  to wait till he does a big one. Oh, shit. Kill, kill, kill. Oh, don't get hit. I'm trying to get
[6429.53s -> 6441.90s]  another Breastland move on him. Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up. Don't
[6441.90s -> 6464.65s]  be an idiot. What's he doing? What's the next phase? I know there's one more thing he does, I think.
[6465.29s -> 6497.29s]  We're good. He's dead. If I ever found out Jerm was secretly serial kill, I wouldn't have trouble
[6497.29s -> 6514.09s]  believing it. What are you talking about? Wow, this guy's a chump. That probably would have
[6514.09s -> 6556.07s]  killed me if I didn't walk high. I need to stop being an idiot. He's dead. One more. Oh, fuck.
[6556.07s -> 6582.18s]  Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. Holy shit. He's a fucking idiot. What? Yeah, he's dead.
[6584.65s -> 6594.14s]  Don't kid yourself. Playtime is over. Oh, I think you have to. Uh oh. Do I actually have to do this?
[6596.01s -> 6633.88s]  Oh, no. Do I? I, I thought, did I? All right, let's get him. Let's get him. Let's get him. Let's get
[6633.88s -> 6640.36s]  him. Let's get him. Let's get him. I thought I had to just press A, but did I though? Because
[6641.08s -> 6649.26s]  he, I thought I had to wait for him. I thought, but that'd be, don't worry, I'll make it quick.
[6663.46s -> 6686.52s]  Just fucking spam him. Oh, fuck. You actually don't have to dodge it. Bloodborne boss health. Yeah,
[6686.52s -> 6694.49s]  it's, it, I can't believe I lost. I can't believe I lost. I thought I had to wait for like him to
[6694.49s -> 6726.79s]  pull an eye pull. Spin wheel with a gun. Look, he's already at 30%. We're good. Die to gun wheel.
[6726.79s -> 6754.07s]  No, this is not gun wheel. Can I dive? I wonder if I can go through that. Battery. Can I dive
[6754.07s -> 6764.02s]  through that? Maybe. I'm too afraid to try it. You lost a doctor piss.
[6773.54s -> 6807.14s]  Come on, knock him down. Shit. Jesus. Need to recover quick. I feel like you guys can hear that
[6807.14s -> 6824.87s]  and you can feel it. Can you hear the wind I'm generating with that? I feel it in my bones.
[6825.83s -> 6843.86s]  How would I do that? You can't even hurt him when he's like that. All right, close. It's close. It's
[6843.86s -> 6871.83s]  close. I'm not going to fuck it up this time. Give me it. Give it to me. I'm going to go. All
[6871.83s -> 6885.59s]  right, hold on. I can't. I thought I could charge up and do it. All right, we're good. Let's press
[6885.59s -> 6924.54s]  A next time. Get it. Get it. Get him. Battery, battery, battery, battery, battery, battery, battery.
[6930.49s -> 6988.47s]  Good. It's not so bad. Okay. Oh my God. Don't die. That was a gnome. All right, there we go.
[6988.47s -> 6992.22s]  Just press A. Press A. I have to just press A.
[7016.30s -> 7019.98s]  Okay, it's A. Got it. I thought I had to go. I can't believe I fucked that up.
[7041.66s -> 7047.02s]  That's the easiest QTE. I forgot it was a QTE. I thought it was just the guy. I thought I had
[7047.02s -> 7065.13s]  to wait for him to start to draw or I would fail the mission. I don't know. Travis, that's rude.
[7065.77s -> 7087.43s]  Like the only reason why I get C rank is because I had to restart. 150k. Max health has increased.
[7088.15s -> 7107.50s]  What is this? What is this spoiler? I don't understand. I want to go see that movie by the
[7107.50s -> 7120.10s]  way. Isn't that movie like apparently one of the worst movies ever made? Didn't they remake CGI on
[7120.10s -> 7123.38s]  it because they desperately were like, holy shit, this has like six on Rotten Tomatoes.
[7137.24s -> 7179.66s]  It was a patch. Day one movie patch. Marvelous. Dr. Peace. Am I going to do Katana's upgrades?
[7179.66s -> 7187.02s]  Yeah, I think I unlock that now actually. I think I get that now. I think this is when the
[7187.02s -> 7213.67s]  store is open. Scott Pilgrim ripoff porn game. No, no, I'm sorry. Hi, this is Diane from Beefhead
[7213.67s -> 7219.99s]  Videos. This is a message from Mr. Travis Touchdown. Just calling to remind you that you haven't
[7219.99s -> 7230.07s]  returned one of our rentals. Big German jugs collection number 23. Be sure to return it soon.
[7230.07s -> 7234.31s]  Have a nice day. Do you guys, I don't know if you guys remember Blockbuster video,
[7235.67s -> 7238.47s]  but do you remember there was a back room at Blockbuster?
[7240.87s -> 7241.91s]  And it was the porn room.
[7241.91s -> 7248.31s]  Very much for your cooperation. In addition, we have faxed you some information about the rankings
[7248.31s -> 7255.03s]  in case you wish to continue your ascent. As a friendly reminder, there will be a small nominal
[7255.03s -> 7259.59s]  fee to participate in ranked fights. It was like another, and there was another, you went into the
[7259.59s -> 7273.78s]  main store and then there was the pornography section that was behind another door. I'm not
[7273.78s -> 7279.78s]  making this up. Is this the same, is this the right video store? Blockbuster porn room.
[7280.50s -> 7310.54s]  Which, wait, what video store had the porn room? Okay, hold on. Yeah, yeah, no, this is real.
[7315.83s -> 7319.19s]  Right by the anime section, they had this little curtain that went into the adult section. The
[7319.19s -> 7322.95s]  place would be pretty open pretty late at night. And as I got into my late teens, it wouldn't be
[7322.95s -> 7327.19s]  uncommon for my friends and I to be there past midnight on weekends playing fighting games.
[7327.19s -> 7330.55s]  It was then that I learned that the place stayed alive because of its porn clientele.
[7331.19s -> 7335.51s]  During the late night hours, a barrage of men would walk behind that curtain and walk out
[7335.51s -> 7339.51s]  with stacks of porn to rent. It was nuts. Literally the busiest time you'd see at the
[7339.51s -> 7350.34s]  rental counter. So, no, this is real. I guess it wasn't Blockbuster, but it was other just like
[7350.34s -> 7363.99s]  rental stores. That's not a lie. There was a secret porn room at a bunch of rental places.
[7364.79s -> 7376.38s]  All right, $200,000 deposit signed. Travis Touchdown. Not at Blockbuster. Yeah, but,
[7377.34s -> 7384.06s]  is it a lie if I'm saying it in the same two sentences? Wait, no, maybe it wasn't. Let me
[7384.06s -> 7389.11s]  check. No, a lie would be like, no, it is Blockbuster. It's Blockbuster. And then
[7389.11s -> 7395.66s]  six days go by and I go, no, and my Blockbuster had it. That would be me lying to you. This is
[7395.66s -> 7402.92s]  me trying to get my facts straight in the same two sentences. I'm just gonna play the damn cat.
[7404.92s -> 7432.89s]  Hey, girl. That's a little cat. Save it. Do I have any more videos? I don't think I do.
[7433.53s -> 7439.91s]  I'm gonna unlock some new jobs, I think. How much money do I have? Like 150, 160?
[7440.63s -> 7466.36s]  Yeah, we're good. Now, let me see if I can actually buy some shit. Naomi's Lab is now open.
[7467.32s -> 7474.20s]  Thunder Ryu building is now open. Area 51 is now open. A new part-time job is now available.
[7478.26s -> 7491.56s]  All right. Very, very cool. Let's go. I need $200,000. Let's go to the katanas first. This
[7491.56s -> 7504.46s]  game is fucking awesome. Yeah. Oh, it is. It's fantastic. To pay no attention to that.
[7505.02s -> 7526.31s]  All right. It's back there. Yeah, it's ready. Lift up the remote to jump. Yeah, I've jumped a few
[7526.31s -> 7538.57s]  times. Play a single finger on anything. What do we got? Oh, it's you again. Something to drink.
[7540.18s -> 7552.28s]  Weapons. The Tsubaki. $98,000. Beam katana created by Naomi. The prototype model. What about parts?
[7553.67s -> 7564.62s]  Accelerator. Beam katana accelerator. A sensor that can locate buried treasure when
[7565.50s -> 7579.69s]  attached to the beam katana. Pretty cool. Let's get the new weapon. Yes. And let's get the weapon
[7579.69s -> 7602.36s]  part too. I want to find buried treasure. Now I have no money. I wonder what color is this one?
[7604.73s -> 7610.87s]  That one looks pretty cool. I know there's at least a handful. I gave him my motorcycle.
[7611.51s -> 7624.02s]  Let's go check out the new jobs. Hit the dumpsters. Yeah. Did he just get on it and park it
[7624.58s -> 7643.08s]  in the same spot that I just left it? $2,000. You can get shirts and a shirt in that dumpster.
[7645.96s -> 7660.38s]  Actually, let me take a little look. I'll go shirt hunting. $2,000. Yeah, I need to go train.
[7660.54s -> 7663.66s]  Actually, you can increase your attack power and shit. Yeah, that's important.
[7665.93s -> 7690.58s]  Find seven of those balls. I got plenty of time for that. Get out of the way. Thunder Ryu building.
[7693.30s -> 7698.90s]  I can learn moves here, I believe. Other stuff. There's stuff to learn. Is this your first ever
[7698.90s -> 7709.00s]  Jerma stream? Can everybody please welcome Jonathan L1037 to the channel, please? Welcome.
[7709.64s -> 7716.26s]  Oh yeah, that. You want to do that. Get over here. I'll teach you a little something. Take off your
[7716.26s -> 7721.94s]  clothes. Off, off. Need your clothes off to do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Want to start? Get naked. Now
[7721.94s -> 7727.54s]  stick your butt out. Out. Can't kill them unless you have strong stance. No, not your arms or hips.
[7727.54s -> 7732.98s]  Haven't you ever taken a dump in a Japanese style toilet? Strong stance. Excellent. Just like that.
[7732.98s -> 7743.70s]  Now you're under pants. That's okay. Keep your clothes on. All right. Dumbbell. This is strength.
[7744.66s -> 7755.02s]  Uh, let's see what it is. Training that will extend your beam katanas combo attacks. Yes,
[7755.02s -> 7762.14s]  that's pretty damn good. You can do them all. Increase your strength. We'll just do this one
[7762.14s -> 7768.84s]  first. I think I have to tap. I'm going to be damn good at this one. You know it. Is it A?
[7782.33s -> 7789.50s]  It's hard to do it on the Wiimote. It's actually hard to do that on the Wiimote because it's not
[7789.90s -> 7805.40s]  an easy button to press. That's not an easy button for me to do the vibrate on.
[7805.40s -> 7832.62s]  You guys know what I mean by that. Let's do this one. Squats. Come on. This is bad form.
[7837.22s -> 7849.48s]  This gets way harder if I remember. Vitality increased. And now let's do this one. How do
[7849.48s -> 7865.43s]  I do this? I think it's alternate. Come on. Is it two pounds?
[7874.33s -> 7887.18s]  Your beam katanas combo has been extended. Nice. Oh, that already leaving already. That's
[7887.18s -> 7905.11s]  that's it. Come again. This dude didn't even re-rack. Oh, fuck. Didn't wipe down equipment.
[7905.11s -> 7911.11s]  That was okay. Re-racking. If people just throw 30 pound weights around and just leave them in
[7911.11s -> 7920.90s]  random places. I would rather have to find the dumbbells than have to sit in a seat that some
[7920.90s -> 7928.89s]  big motherfucker sits in. It's sweating profusely. They get up and the chair is wet.
[7929.93s -> 7935.85s]  Soaking wet. I'm not going to sit on that. And then I have to go and go get the spray bottle and I
[7935.85s -> 7949.22s]  have to clean up this person's gross body liquid. Or I just walk by and I go I'm not using I'm not
[7949.22s -> 7969.78s]  doing that one today. All right here we go. Come on in brother. Don't judge a book by its cover okay.
[7970.66s -> 7975.62s]  This is just my personal style. A man should stick to his guns you know. Make a good selection now
[7975.62s -> 7981.54s]  bro. Be sure before you purchase okay. If you don't make up your mind soon I'll have to stop
[7981.54s -> 7987.06s]  letting you in here bro. I'm going nuts here. I'm hard on myself and my customers but that's
[7987.06s -> 7998.76s]  just my the right way to do things you know. Okay new jacket. I want black. Yeah oh shit I don't
[7998.76s -> 8013.72s]  have any money. Heat. Radioactive. All right I'm gonna put on the banana shirt. New jeans.
[8014.44s -> 8026.95s]  These are expensive. All right these ones. Belts. Who gives a shit about a belt? Nobody sees it.
[8026.95s -> 8032.23s]  I know I don't get I don't get the belt thing. You can go to Walmart and get a belt for
[8033.19s -> 8047.99s]  12 dollars. Nobody who cares about your belt. Guys I could probably unwrap a fruit by the foot
[8048.63s -> 8053.75s]  and put it in as a belt and you probably it would take me to have to tell you that
[8053.75s -> 8061.53s]  that's what's there for you to notice it. I need different sunglasses. I don't have
[8061.53s -> 8077.27s]  enough money for this. I want the blue ones. All right let's go. See you in another life brother.
[8077.27s -> 8083.98s]  What the fuck was that? That guy had the game like hung up for a second and that was weird.
[8084.78s -> 8092.84s]  Hey remember all the money I just spent? Uh yeah now we have to do coconut missions for like an
[8092.84s -> 8106.58s]  hour. If you think I'm making this up go read any review on this game. You'll see all the reviewers
[8106.58s -> 8114.10s]  gave this game. This game got like sevens like high six low sevens when it was reviewed when it
[8114.10s -> 8120.97s]  first came up because everybody complained about having to do coconut missions for an hour.
[8121.85s -> 8125.90s]  That's because it is. No this is no that's a high seven. This is a high seven game.
[8126.94s -> 8132.38s]  I can't I can't hear that this is this low a mid-six game. I can't I can't hear that.
[8134.65s -> 8148.65s]  Let's do a job. This is uh this this this is a seven this is like a seven six on a on a sunny
[8148.65s -> 8165.42s]  day. This is like seven nine on a rainy day. Third class man I have not mastered the secret
[8165.42s -> 8172.14s]  of the first class yet. What is he talking? It's not too bad. The first rated god will give a
[8172.14s -> 8180.18s]  hard-working man a little smile. Today's job has been listed on the bulletin board. Lawn mowing.
[8180.18s -> 8184.02s]  Looking for lawn mowers cut as much grass as you can inside the required area
[8184.74s -> 8189.00s]  within the limit. Three hundred dollars for each acre. Let's go.
[8192.12s -> 8200.50s]  Do you can still do assassin missions? Oh yeah that's right there's there's one available.
[8201.30s -> 8222.68s]  We'll do this one first. Locate the client. Yep yep yep. Um what are the pink blips on the map?
[8223.24s -> 8226.52s]  I don't remember what those are. All right do you think I can jump a house?
[8227.16s -> 8233.14s]  I'm trying to jump. Why wouldn't you jump? All right we won't have enough battery.
[8233.86s -> 8256.55s]  All right don't kill the client. The blips are oh the treasure all right nice. No I won't
[8256.55s -> 8269.21s]  get out of here. There are dreams in the unspoken rules of santa destroy. A verdant law awaits you
[8269.21s -> 8273.85s]  in your future. Amazed like manor house with a huge pool and a brilliant green lawn.
[8274.65s -> 8279.29s]  Just as the god of hard work handwork waits at the end of a long day's work.
[8279.29s -> 8286.18s]  The god of lawns shall smile upon all who mow them. Cut cut cut and mow.
[8289.66s -> 8297.19s]  Handwork. Yeah this one sucks. Cut back the wildly overgrown grass.
[8299.00s -> 8305.45s]  A and B. Twist the oh I have to twist the Wiimote. Z button turns. Wait what?
[8306.57s -> 8329.96s]  What do you mean turns? I feel like playing farmer's dynasty again. This is a generous acre.
[8337.10s -> 8339.98s]  Oh shit I have to get it at least. I have to do it the whole thing.
[8341.53s -> 8348.94s]  This grass is so bad. This is it really is. I know this didn't even exist back then. Did it?
[8349.74s -> 8354.50s]  This is the default unity grass. I don't even think that it does this.
[8354.50s -> 8369.18s]  No yeah unity wasn't the thing back here. Yeah unity didn't exist.
[8369.74s -> 8381.22s]  Maybe it did but it wasn't out to the public. Could you make a game in unity in like 2005?
[8382.02s -> 8399.13s]  It came out in 2005. Maybe. I don't know. This is gonna drop me nuts if I don't get this whole
[8399.13s -> 8403.21s]  thing eventually. I'm gonna have to do this a few times so I can get all of it at one you know what
[8403.21s -> 8427.45s]  I mean. Oh look at me. Look at me. Shit I'm not gonna get it all. I have to get at least 100.
[8429.34s -> 8448.06s]  No I'll get 80. 86. Damn it. How much is that worth? Coconuts are like 20 to 25 000. This is 20.
[8448.06s -> 8451.74s]  This is is this longer than coconuts? I think this might be actually easier than coconuts.
[8453.22s -> 8456.02s]  A third raider. I've got another job for you. Something a little shadier.
[8456.98s -> 8461.78s]  Sent an introduction ticket. The road to becoming a first raider is long and hard. Get your ass in
[8461.78s -> 8470.68s]  here. There's better jobs. Yeah that's new assassin is available. Cool. Well put it put us right in
[8470.68s -> 8485.35s]  front of it. Let's do it. It's an easier job but it doesn't bop. Yeah I feel you. Okay we got the
[8485.35s -> 8492.31s]  bronze on pizza butt. Snake hall 2000. 3,000. 4500 per kill. Baseball battle. Going to batting
[8492.31s -> 8501.86s]  killing spree. Oh let's do this one. 4500 per kill. I think I just didn't play baseball.
[8502.58s -> 8516.63s]  Jeremy you'd look a lot cuter if you were 20 years younger.
[8523.34s -> 8548.28s]  I'm sorry that age exists. Maybe one day it won't. I want to dig. Maybe one day you can live to be
[8548.28s -> 8567.51s]  like 200 and not like get saggy cheeks like I do. You'd be 14. Oh shit. Hey whoa. What the fuck?
[8578.95s -> 8593.38s]  Fan that guy. He just did the math in his head. Where's this treasure? It's right here.
[8594.18s -> 8615.00s]  Am I not on top of it? Where is it? Got it. Well this this is where that person says,
[8615.00s -> 8621.08s]  oh well Jerma I thought you were 55 years old. He's like oh well that's yeah I see you making
[8621.08s -> 8641.90s]  like a joke. You making you making fun of me. Okay it was a joke. Yeah it's a it's a you look old
[8641.90s -> 8651.50s]  joke. I'm aware of those. All right I know. The car hit boxes are huge. Yeah they're enormous.
[8651.50s -> 8671.51s]  All right let me go do this one. He's getting tired of them. No I have some really really
[8671.51s -> 8680.44s]  important news for you guys. When you turn 30 you don't care about that anymore. Like I don't.
[8680.44s -> 8687.69s]  I know. I know. Like I don't like it doesn't bother me. After you turn 30 years old it's just like
[8687.69s -> 8692.33s]  it don't matter. I'm gonna still it's I'm getting older now. That's it. And people go wow you look
[8692.33s -> 8698.09s]  old. I mean that's because I'm getting older. It's okay. When I was 29 I was like no I can't turn
[8698.57s -> 8704.41s]  30. I'm gonna be old. And then the second you turn 30 it's like oh okay everything's fine.
[8706.01s -> 8725.53s]  All right. No. You're really handsome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
[8728.38s -> 8735.13s]  That's a shitload of money. It's 36,000 dollars for that. I'm just doing that one again. How does it
[8735.13s -> 8746.55s]  feel to have both feet in the grave? Oh well let's see. 30 34. Let's figure what's the average age of
[8746.79s -> 8771.37s]  a U.S. male? What is it? Is it 80? 75 is it? Well what's the 77? 75? Okay. So now what is the
[8771.37s -> 8777.62s]  average age of a U.S. male? Oh the shitload of medical problems. You know like I've got like
[8777.62s -> 8782.58s]  I've got like a hernia. I've got fucking colitis. I have costochondritis. Like what how low is that?
[8783.38s -> 8793.42s]  60 65 30. All right yeah so I'm so what am I halfway dead? Oh shit.
[8795.62s -> 8806.92s]  You I don't have oh fuck I do. I've got two feet in the grave. I'm going to the beach to get this
[8806.92s -> 8821.96s]  one. I have to get down there. Do I fear death? I'll just come back as a butterfly and fly around
[8821.96s -> 8832.02s]  for a little bit. Yeah you could just that'd be fine. And then and then when somebody likes
[8832.02s -> 8838.87s]  when I get squashed into somebody's windshield I'll I'll wake up again and I'll be like a fucking
[8838.87s -> 8844.26s]  ant. See that's the thing about still like oh what about like do you believe in like reincarnation?
[8844.82s -> 8850.66s]  I mean that's a very interesting concept but how what determines there are like 600 trillion ants.
[8850.66s -> 8861.11s]  Ants. You respawning as a human is is like 0.000000001 percent.
[8864.20s -> 8867.48s]  Like there are 600 million ants for every one person probably.
[8868.68s -> 8872.36s]  You're going to be an ant. You're going to you can respawn as an ant over and over and over and
[8872.36s -> 8884.84s]  over again for millenniums. And then maybe you'll. Holy shit I'm a baby. Oh my god took 600 fucking
[8884.84s -> 8897.48s]  eons. I had to live with an ant like 600 trillion fucking times. Ah don't step on me. Oh fuck.
[8898.79s -> 8907.98s]  No I'm okay. The hive's being invaded by killer bees. Oh no I'm a person again.
[8908.54s -> 8920.55s]  Can you imagine having to live 500 million lifetimes as like the the worst life ever like that?
[8923.02s -> 8926.94s]  All right all right yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna carry this piece of sand
[8927.58s -> 8934.30s]  in my mouth. Oh okay I'm gonna walk and place the sand one grain of sand down. Turn around do it
[8934.30s -> 8944.17s]  again do another grain of sand. Do this till I'm dead. And then you respawn again. Oh fuck I gotta
[8944.17s -> 8949.93s]  get that grain of sand. Oh let me make sure I lay down a chemical trail so my blind friends can see
[8949.93s -> 8973.26s]  where I'm going. All right where's my fight? Reincarnation doesn't work like that.
[8973.98s -> 8984.86s]  Yeah but I mean if it did what but if it did if it was just luck of the lottery if you
[8984.86s -> 8992.33s]  respawned 500 million times an ant the one time you respawn as an as an anteater you're gonna
[8992.33s -> 9004.17s]  be like oh my no no no no no I can't do this. I can't do this. I know what it's like to be that
[9004.17s -> 9022.98s]  guy. You're gonna respawn as a fish like a goldfish in a bowl and be like oh thank god
[9024.76s -> 9031.26s]  that's your cooldown period that's where you get to just chill. It's gonna seem like five minutes
[9035.02s -> 9044.57s]  the three years that you're a goldfish in a bowl is gonna feel like five minutes. I want to go to
[9044.57s -> 9063.51s]  the where is it how much money do I need? A lot. I want to go the other way. What's some of the new
[9063.51s -> 9070.31s]  ones? Let me try one of the other new ones. What if you get a turtle? I mean that's pretty that's
[9070.31s -> 9075.59s]  not bad. That's pretty good. That's like a hundred years. Can't some turtles live to be like 150?
[9076.15s -> 9083.83s]  That's not bad but it's still it does not even come close to the light years of time you'll be
[9083.83s -> 9091.48s]  an ant or a beetle or something. Kill using wrestling moves only. No other moves are allowed
[9091.48s -> 9101.82s]  for this mission. I'll try it. Would you want to live as a turtle? But if that's what you got it's
[9101.82s -> 9115.66s]  better than living as an ant. Is it though? Yeah you you can like swim around and just like lie on
[9115.66s -> 9122.81s]  a rock for six hours. You guys have a some of you guys might even own turtles. They get to just sit
[9122.81s -> 9138.94s]  down on a rock it doesn't have the sunbeam down on them for like 14-15 hours a day. That's pretty
[9138.94s -> 9148.23s]  that's not bad that's pretty cool actually. Respawning as an ant over and over again is
[9148.23s -> 9153.83s]  the equivalent of waking up and nuclear bombs are going off around your house all day until
[9153.83s -> 9163.13s]  you're dead. Just every all every second it's just just mayhem. I would I could I would be able to
[9163.13s -> 9175.37s]  I could sit on a rock for a little while as a turtle. What if you're born as a pigeon? I could
[9175.37s -> 9183.21s]  fly. You can just fly around. Okay some of you guys that want to what do you mean be a pigeon?
[9183.93s -> 9188.09s]  You know that a lot of that a decent amount of pigeons like fly around New York City and eat old
[9188.09s -> 9196.42s]  french fries on the ground. You that's what's wrong is that bad? What's wrong with that?
[9201.94s -> 9206.66s]  In fact that's like kind of like that's kind of how my life is now. You know like just eating
[9206.66s -> 9212.07s]  french fries and like junk food and going you know what I mean like that doesn't sound bad.
[9217.61s -> 9228.15s]  Only wrestling words. Pigeons are like the goats of the bird world. All right only killed with oh
[9228.15s -> 9241.50s]  right I can only because isn't isn't a goat stomach made out of like rocks? Like can a
[9241.50s -> 9256.12s]  goat eat like a can't goats eat like anything? Isn't there like a what what no I swear to god
[9256.12s -> 9263.99s]  there's like who has like the iron stomach? They ever anyone can eat anything. No I swear to god
[9263.99s -> 9273.02s]  there's like something about it's some it's it's goats right? I mean they're not supposed to like
[9273.02s -> 9276.54s]  obviously you're not they're not supposed to without you know but there's something about
[9276.54s -> 9286.38s]  the way that they process the food or something. It's called a gastrolith. I know I'm not crazy.
[9286.54s -> 9299.16s]  Hey bro they can literally eat razor wire. I didn't know that.
[9301.64s -> 9326.71s]  That was fucking awesome. Tombstone again. Yeah. What was this 3,000 for kill?
[9327.83s -> 9347.02s]  People are shooting guns now. Bro please bro what? Why can I not hit B? All right 13 that's an
[9347.02s -> 9364.84s]  unlucky number. I don't like it. Ah shit. That shouldn't be bad. 30 uh 40,000. Chill bro. I'm
[9364.84s -> 9380.01s]  fine. That's well that's the first time we get to see the new sword. How much money do I got? What
[9380.01s -> 9384.89s]  about if you spawn as a whale? All right I got 114,000. I need more money than that. Damn I need
[9384.89s -> 9390.17s]  that shitload more. This is why you don't buy clothes until you have five million dollars.
[9391.05s -> 9403.30s]  What are my thoughts on goat cheese? I wonder how polarizing this is going to be. I don't think it
[9403.30s -> 9408.82s]  will be very polarizing. I'm not. I don't think it will be. I think it's disgusting. I think it
[9408.82s -> 9414.90s]  tastes like dirt. I think it tastes like actual physical soil in the ground. Dirt. I hate it.
[9421.37s -> 9425.37s]  Third class man. I have not mastered the secret of the first class yet. It's not too bad.
[9426.57s -> 9433.91s]  Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Anyone? All right I gotta get gold on this one.
[9435.83s -> 9443.11s]  It's way too overpowering for me. I can tell when goat cheese isn't anything. It's like the
[9443.11s -> 9449.13s]  princess lying on the mattress with the pee under it. I'll I know it's in there. If you give me even
[9449.13s -> 9457.13s]  a tiny little crumble of goat cheese I will take a bite and just I know that there's a pee under my
[9457.13s -> 9482.66s]  mattress. PEA guys. You guys don't know that. That's like a classic fairy tale. You think we
[9482.74s -> 9491.94s]  don't we think we know? All right I gotta get gold on this one. But do you like cream cheese? Yes
[9492.66s -> 9509.88s]  I do. I love cream cheese. You know forget about technique. I'm just gonna try to get as many
[9509.88s -> 9533.75s]  acres as possible. Who cares if I don't get it all? Already much better pace than last time. Cream
[9533.75s -> 9543.00s]  cheese is dank. Yeah I'm not I actually don't like I mean something I don't like it but I uh I'd rather
[9543.00s -> 9551.66s]  there be stuff in the cream cheese like chive onion salmon like salmon on the cream you know I
[9551.66s -> 9561.00s]  it's got to be uh dressed up a little I mean I I love it I do like it but if I had a choice
[9562.20s -> 9567.64s]  I would eat the one that had something in it. Vegetables. Vegetable medley whatever it's called
[9567.64s -> 9574.30s]  the vegetable one where there's little carrot chunks and celery chunks. Don't make this a
[9574.30s -> 9594.60s]  fucking three-hour stream guys. What are you doing? Get it all. There's only one more piece.
[9594.60s -> 9604.02s]  There's one more nose hair. Trim the last nose hair. Got it. Yeah liver and cream cheese is pretty
[9604.02s -> 9617.30s]  good. I can't eat liver. I've tried chicken livers and no I can't do it. It's too it's too
[9617.30s -> 9623.86s]  heavy for me. It has too strong of a flavor. I know it's so good for you too. I know eating
[9623.86s -> 9635.24s]  chicken liver is new fight mission. Oh cool. Chicken livers are they're they're packed with
[9635.24s -> 9646.95s]  so much nutrients. I know I can't do it though. It's just not for me. Would you eat cream cheese
[9646.95s -> 9656.33s]  pizza? Uh probably not. Pizza's already heavy. I don't think I'd want to weigh pizza down even more.
[9657.13s -> 9668.15s]  My mother used to make chicken livers all the time and I would ever I would try it every time
[9668.15s -> 9682.39s]  and I would not like it every time. Jesus Christ. That was horrible. That was that was really bad.
[9683.27s -> 9694.42s]  We've already had the cheese debate in this channel. I did the cheese tier list.
[9695.06s -> 9704.17s]  I hate to bring politics into this chat but what's your opinion on stuffed crust pizzas?
[9704.89s -> 9719.05s]  They're unbelievable. They're unbelievable. But you have to be in the mood for it. Stuffed crust
[9719.05s -> 9728.07s]  pizza is disgusting except for the one occasion every maybe few months where you are just sitting
[9728.07s -> 9733.51s]  on your couch and your eyes bing whip open and there's a light bulb over your head and you go
[9733.51s -> 9739.11s]  I want a stuffed crust pizza right now. Then it's a 10 out of 10. It's apps it's the best fucking
[9739.11s -> 9744.26s]  thing on earth when you have the light bulb and every other scenario know it's horrible
[9744.26s -> 9751.58s]  but that happens sometimes. Free fight mission kill until you take a single hit from the enemy.
[9751.58s -> 9762.14s]  Kill them all within the time limit. Oh this is gonna be hard. Don't take damage. Use stances
[9762.14s -> 9794.20s]  with this weapon. Now it's not embarrassing if I die. I mean it would be but not even. Cross.
[9795.16s -> 9815.19s]  Yes. Crossing. He's still alive. He's still alive. That guy's still alive.
[9829.14s -> 9848.79s]  Greedy. All right I'll take 10. I'll take 10 kills. Now it's gonna get. Oh I did it. There we go.
[9851.83s -> 9867.94s]  Cheese is disgusting. Um I mean it's a lot of people can't eat it. If you're lactose intolerant
[9867.94s -> 9873.91s]  cheese kind of balls up in people. So it does. I don't find that to be Lego. What'd you say? How
[9873.91s -> 9886.70s]  could you say that? If you're lactose intolerant you it kills you. It's I mean I love that stuff
[9890.06s -> 9909.51s]  but even it's hard to eat that. It's hard to eat cheese in large quantities. False. It's okay well
[9910.31s -> 9915.82s]  it's not hard to eat cheese in large quantities. It's very easy because it tastes really great
[9916.78s -> 9923.88s]  and you can sit there and eat it all day. But what I mean is physically after you do that
[9923.88s -> 9946.66s]  you might feel quite ill. Barry's back. No can we change that name because it's not backtracking.
[9946.66s -> 9967.06s]  Can you call me like Clarification Crisp? That's more accurate. It's backtracking the name. No
[9967.06s -> 9979.80s]  that's uh it's just Clarification Crisp. Additional Statement Aaron.
[9988.97s -> 9992.65s]  All right I want to get. Do I have gold on both these? I do. Oh shit I do have gold.
[9993.61s -> 9997.61s]  No I don't want to do any. I've got gold. I don't want to do them. What's the other one?
[10004.07s -> 10020.78s]  Juxtaposition Jill. Correction Kevin. All right I'm gonna do another one.
[10021.34s -> 10042.79s]  Let's get this one. I guess I look cool doing it. Addendum Andrew. Addendum Andy. Addendum Addendum Andy.
[10046.97s -> 10067.16s]  Why does it all. I wanted to turn the other way. Why does it always turn this way?
[10068.20s -> 10085.38s]  Maybe it's the other way I'm holding the Wiimote. Hold down drift. Is drift uh
[10088.98s -> 10094.50s]  buy a new sword? All right I have a new one right now. I'm not going to buy another one. No I won't
[10094.50s -> 10121.98s]  be able to have it in the next mission. Simpsons hit and run flashbacks. There we go. Oh no this
[10121.98s -> 10136.98s]  is not. Oh this is another free fight. All right I'm trying not to get hit again. They have guns.
[10137.94s -> 10146.15s]  They have guns. No they don't. It's not guns. I thought it was guns.
[10147.11s -> 10171.14s]  Oh he almost hit me. Whoa. Whoa. Okay I'm fine. Whoa. No I'm not. He almost hit me. Whoa. Okay.
[10173.64s -> 10184.73s]  In the corner. I gotta get in the corner. Please look. Okay get this guy first.
[10196.65s -> 10203.77s]  Oh shit. Oh shit. I want to run run run run turn. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I almost got hit.
[10212.17s -> 10245.35s]  Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Watch it. One more guy right here. Come here. Got
[10245.35s -> 10255.16s]  it. That's it right? Any more? Yeah. These missions are the hardest thing in the game.
[10256.57s -> 10269.59s]  Yeah they are. They are. Give me the gold. This game is inherently satisfying. Yes it is. All right
[10269.59s -> 10275.61s]  I got enough money for the entrance for the next fee for the next germa rumble. Two hundred and
[10275.61s -> 10285.08s]  twelve thousand dollars. Okay let me go back. Let me go back to the house and save. I have the new
[10285.08s -> 10289.77s]  blade on. Yeah I do because I'm using one hand to hold it. The other one was two handed wasn't it?
[10290.73s -> 10297.43s]  Travis with the next rumble. I already told you what's gonna happen to smash.
[10298.07s -> 10333.74s]  It's fighters past two combatant three. I just stole somebody else's prediction.
[10338.79s -> 10350.26s]  What? I'm playing no more heroes today. That's why I'm saying that and then he's a Nintendo
[10350.26s -> 10359.86s]  character. Well let me have this. Let me have. You can tell them to talk with my hands.
[10371.91s -> 10379.16s]  We don't need any more sword characters. Well that just. Oh no I can't say this. Never mind.
[10382.42s -> 10391.85s]  No. Well then. Well then delete like the 12 fire emblem characters that are the same character.
[10392.97s -> 10429.22s]  I tried to stop. I tried to stop myself. Pick me up. Pick me up. Come pick me up. Oh what's that?
[10430.81s -> 10440.60s]  Hold on. Oh well I mean here's the thing though. If you're a big fan. If you're a big fan of uh
[10441.83s -> 10446.47s]  of fire emblem. I look if you like those characters that's really really good.
[10447.35s -> 10453.75s]  I'm happy that you care about that series. I'm just saying that very very clearly if there's
[10453.75s -> 10459.75s]  already like 10 12 sword characters in the game. I don't we don't need that many more.
[10460.55s -> 10463.75s]  I guess is what I'm trying to say. It's a cool series though.
[10464.47s -> 10485.45s]  Fire Emblem is awesome. I played it. It's very very good. Play with the cat. You hungry? We get
[10485.45s -> 10490.98s]  to watch the cat eat. You thought there was only one or two cat interactions. It's like 10. There
[10490.98s -> 10519.61s]  there. Hungry cat. Moments like these is what makes me know that Travis isn't that bad.
[10520.57s -> 10538.57s]  Yeah let's go to the draw. Let's see. Yeah that's the original one. I'm using the new one. It's the
[10538.57s -> 10553.50s]  Tsubaki. Yeah I got it on. All right let's go to assassin mission number eight. Travis is a
[10553.50s -> 10581.45s]  shithead. Travis is a bad dude. Yeah pretty I mean yeah. Fuckhead. PS3 remake sucks. Well that's
[10582.09s -> 10589.88s]  I'm I'm I know that strong opinion. I'm not I'm that's I'm not playing the PS3 one. This is the
[10592.17s -> 10614.82s]  Wii version. Wii version of the game. I hope you could hear the air quotes. How do I dig into
[10614.82s -> 10632.87s]  concrete? Where is that? What version is the Wii version? My control is rumbling.
[10647.06s -> 10662.81s]  He means Wii guys. Yes he means this is what he means. Yes yes yes yes there it is.
[10663.45s -> 10677.22s]  He's got to prove he owns the game and the console. He's got to prove he owns the game and the console
[10677.22s -> 10698.04s]  in his closet. Play rhythm heaven you coward. That's part of the plan. Yeah the next fight has been
[10698.04s -> 10704.68s]  set. Wait a sec why the hell you telling me this over the phone? Why? Because I cannot. Oh shit is

[10710.22s -> 10716.06s]  This is serious business. So serious that I'm going to spray perfume on every square.
[10717.10s -> 10725.72s]  Oh shit that's close. That's close. Yeah whatever. Your next opponent to the school
[10725.72s -> 10732.28s]  and then what? Just go. You'll know what I'm talking about I think. What do you mean you think?
[10732.28s -> 10739.24s]  You know you really suck at your job. Life is more important than some job. That is why I am
[10739.24s -> 10747.98s]  busy shopping right now or busy killing people because that is all you ever do. What am I wrong?
[10747.98s -> 10775.90s]  Well I guess not. Omega porn game. It's not a fucking omega porn game. Omega porn game.
[10775.90s -> 10783.18s]  Ranking battle eight. No guys an omega porn game is just you going to Pornhub and opening up a tab.
[10784.14s -> 10814.04s]  That what are you talking about? That's not a game. Let's play that game.
[10826.33s -> 10826.97s]  Relax.
[10839.80s -> 10840.28s]  Ranking.
[10862.30s -> 10864.70s]  I'm not gonna know what that is. I don't know what that is. I'm not gonna say the rest of that. I
[10864.70s -> 10877.38s]  don't know what the fuck that is. I'm not saying any shit.
[10877.38s -> 10882.23s]  Just look at him.
[10886.33s -> 10911.22s]  Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill him. Fire axe. Any goodies that I missed?
[10923.77s -> 10924.49s]  That's my favorite one.
[10938.95s -> 10946.76s]  What the how many combos do I was it five hit or six hit combo now?
[10960.84s -> 10963.40s]  Date the AI from AI dungeons and get its number.
[10964.20s -> 10978.14s]  What are you talking about? I'm on team Travis. Travis.
[10985.96s -> 11002.46s]  Can you play the rest of Nancy Drew? Um no.
[11006.66s -> 11007.70s]  Not today.
[11017.70s -> 11018.26s]  No not today.
[11018.26s -> 11030.89s]  What was that? That's a based response. Uh oh.
[11035.54s -> 11105.80s]  Based. What was that? Easy. Double. Oh no. Damn it. Damn it. Money.
[11108.04s -> 11131.93s]  Money. Someone just said I love money. Let me see what this does.
[11131.93s -> 11158.14s]  It just makes lots of smoke. Do you love money? Money. Oh it extinguishes you if you're on fire.
[11158.86s -> 11165.86s]  That's what it does. Of course it does. Hey anybody in chat love money?
[11176.04s -> 11198.20s]  Idiot. What's that? I need it. Holy shit. What is this one? This one is all bar bar bar. What
[11198.20s -> 11213.48s]  does it do though? Oh my god. Okay it's an instant kill. That's unfortunate. You turn into a creepy
[11213.48s -> 11242.02s]  pasta. I got it again. Shit. What does he say? Raspberry chocolate brownie. Strawberry on the
[11242.10s -> 11267.34s]  fucking shortcake. Oh there's nobody here. Uh doesn't that make you ineffective? Oh it makes
[11268.14s -> 11268.78s]  makes me.

[11297.34s -> 11298.30s]  How do I stop this?
[11303.40s -> 11306.84s]  Dude get to a bathroom. I've what are you talking about? Yeah I got it.
[11307.88s -> 11330.33s]  I can't. There we go. Now I can do a bunch of combos. It's the rocket wheelchair.
[11338.94s -> 11345.74s]  I think it'd be a pretty good uh swing sword voice for a video game. You know what I'm saying?
[11346.95s -> 11375.19s]  Shoot. Come on. Give me. Please. It's link. No it's not.
[11387.19s -> 11409.59s]  That's not link. No it's not. Yeah that one is. Yeah. How am I getting so many lucky rolls here?
[11415.62s -> 11418.10s]  Imagine saying that and then getting destroyed. Wait what?
[11419.38s -> 11427.74s]  I got that guy like five times. Oh fuck I don't know which way I was going to the hall.
[11439.96s -> 11443.24s]  What a pain. You're a joke. What a pain. You're a joke.
[11449.14s -> 11479.08s]  Grab. Grab. Grab. Grab him. I left for an hour and a half and he made the same joke from an hour and a
[11479.08s -> 11489.69s]  half. Which one? What do you mean? What are you talking about? Which what what did I say?
[11493.62s -> 11501.03s]  You're a joke. What? I'm just. No I'm repeating the. What are you talking about? I'm
[11502.57s -> 11506.01s]  repeating the word that he says when he says you're a joke.
[11508.66s -> 11523.13s]  What? Are you prepared? I'm gonna say that a bunch of fucking times guys. I've. Kim told. I've
[11523.13s -> 11531.75s]  probably told this story. Kim walked down the stairs one time and I was for three days straight
[11532.31s -> 11539.32s]  was repeating the same Thanos lines from Infinity War. She came down while I was going like this
[11539.32s -> 11544.84s]  universe is finite. It's resources finite. The will. I just I did his entire monologue
[11545.56s -> 11555.00s]  all the time and eventually she was like can you stop doing the Thanos monologue and I'm just like
[11555.00s -> 11560.31s]  what the what are you talking about? I don't even know I'm doing that. It just happens. I just do
[11560.31s -> 11568.46s]  that one time. Okay I was taking a shower like three or four weeks ago and I was just talking.
[11568.46s -> 11573.74s]  I was just doing like a scene from a movie and I didn't know I didn't think anyone was home.
[11574.46s -> 11578.74s]  She just walks in and I and I look at her and like oh hey hey she's like what are you doing?
[11578.74s -> 11588.15s]  I'm like I don't know I'm just like talking. That's the last time you showered.
[11597.98s -> 11610.98s]  When this stream is over today I'm going to be just hanging out in my room
[11611.94s -> 11615.64s]  just going are you prepared huh? Are you prepared huh?
[11618.12s -> 11628.23s]  Over and over again until I go to sleep. I don't know it's just fun.
[11653.78s -> 11671.88s]  Stop hitting me. Stop hitting me. You're annoying me now. Now you're annoying me.
[11672.36s -> 11694.79s]  All right that was a tricky room. His brain can only hold so much data.
[11696.55s -> 11699.19s]  My brain can hold a shitload of data. Thank you very much.
[11701.11s -> 11707.43s]  Look one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
[11708.23s -> 11726.14s]  fourteen uh one in the five from the number um uh-oh a new sith lord.
[11735.98s -> 11761.06s]  Wait for the opportunity. Damn it. Did it hit me?
[11769.34s -> 11778.17s]  Shit these guys are kicking my ass. No no no these guys shoot me. Holy fuck I cut through that guy
[11778.17s -> 11796.62s]  like holy holy heck. Battery battery. Fuck I don't know what he's doing.
[11806.20s -> 11817.48s]  There it is on his neck.
[11822.95s -> 11829.91s]  Go back to Nancy Drew. This clearly isn't your pace and you think Nancy Drew is my pace? I had
[11829.91s -> 11837.35s]  to use a walkthrough to complete the puzzles in that game. I'm confused. I have your statement
[11838.31s -> 11848.58s]  I had to be on gameboomers.com the whole stream. I knew it. I called you cheater. We already I
[11848.58s -> 11855.35s]  already talked we talked about that already. That wasn't a secret. I was only using it when it was
[11855.35s -> 11868.70s]  completely necessary. Like anytime a fucking math problem would come on screen. Your next ranked
[11868.70s -> 11874.14s]  fight begins the moment you step into that room. Win and you'll rise to ace in rank.
[11880.78s -> 11889.53s]  Hit the can. Pick the tartar of your teeth. When you're ready step inside. Tartar tartar sauce.
[11890.17s -> 11894.09s]  Fried fish. Fried fish sandwich. There's only one way to find out. I'll be back tomorrow.
[11894.09s -> 11900.06s]  I want to go I'll make a fried fish sandwich. I am uncertain you're returning from this battle
[11900.06s -> 11908.23s]  Travis. In a body bag. The garden of madness. Oh come on you don't give me give me a break.
[11909.19s -> 11915.77s]  You can't give me a break. Come on really. Come on give me a break. Give me a break. Give me a
[11915.77s -> 11931.29s]  break. Your ADHD is an overdrive. Sometimes it does feel like that though. Remember the Bing
[11931.29s -> 11937.72s]  commercial? Where it was like fried fish. Fried fish $2.99. Fried fish $2.99. $200. The people
[11937.72s -> 11948.01s]  all yelling at each other in grocery store and stuff. Somebody would say something and somebody
[11948.01s -> 11951.69s]  would say something after that that was connected to that word. You guys don't remember this
[11951.69s -> 11963.08s]  commercial? Yeah search overload. That's that was a not even that long ago. That was like
[11963.08s -> 11968.36s]  five years ago. Travis now you're getting back into the groove. Remember the 18th suplex of your
[11968.36s -> 11975.98s]  master. The trust building exercise gone wrong. Captured. You remembered an old professional
[11975.98s -> 12006.54s]  wrestling move. Search overload. It was 12 years ago. Those commercials were funny.
[12010.95s -> 12013.83s]  I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you with the reuse joke thing.
[12018.20s -> 12043.10s]  Um rank eight. Here we go. A rankings fight? Yeah how about it? All right will you give me a minute?
[12049.21s -> 12069.70s]  Wait for me in the hallway. Right. Mind if we do this somewhere else? You're the boss.
[12070.58s -> 12081.27s]  Stop checking me out like that. You killed them? Such a gentleman. Are you asking out of
[12081.27s -> 12088.15s]  tactical curiosity or are you just fucking with me? Bet they didn't offer much resistance.
[12089.03s -> 12096.57s]  You got a problem with that? You got no idea how hard it is to hide your true self around here.
[12096.57s -> 12107.24s]  Hey I'm not accusing anybody. How? Real gentlemen. I just turned my back but you didn't strike.
[12108.04s -> 12113.56s]  You are fucking with me. It's actually pretty hard to take cheap shots when your enemy is as
[12113.56s -> 12120.52s]  bloodthirsty as yourself. People like us think alike. Don't. Is there a cabin over here? Shall
[12120.52s -> 12133.61s]  we? Does it need to be explained? Go. You will pay with your life. Have my chance. I will now
[12133.61s -> 12139.10s]  avenge my father. Something tells me you watch too many samurai movies little girl.
[12139.10s -> 12151.37s]  What the hell was that?
[12154.14s -> 12162.87s]  Robert Atkinson really does add so much to this character. Seriously. That like. Only he could do
[12162.87s -> 12199.02s]  that. Easy. Low. I think she's going low mostly. Yep. Oh that hurts. What's with my stamina? My
[12199.74s -> 12225.48s]  beam stamina? Get it. Whoa. It's low. This song's really good. It is pretty good.
[12233.80s -> 12243.91s]  Got it. No mercy. No mercy. No mercy. No mercy. Ow. All right. Don't fuck around.
[12256.38s -> 12280.47s]  Do we move? What? I didn't catch you in a combo? What? Watch that battery power. Oh fuck. That hurt.
[12290.87s -> 12295.50s]  Ooh. Did I get it? All right. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. I need to charge.
[12302.14s -> 12352.42s]  Oh shit. Not good. What the hell? Fucking battery. Why? Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Don't do it.
[12353.14s -> 12360.55s]  Don't do it. Oh fuck. What you doing? Oh no, no, no, no, no. Don't kill me. Please don't kill me.
[12361.27s -> 12386.44s]  Is that a kill? Is that an instant kill? Where am I? Oh this health. Oh shit. My fucking pants.
[12388.60s -> 12401.64s]  Oh shit. I tried to dodge it. I'm dead. I'm dead. Fuck. I tried. I dodged it. You got.
[12402.20s -> 12420.79s]  Shit. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. This health right over here.
[12420.79s -> 12426.95s]  Fuck this. Fuck that. You actually just hit me. How dare you?
[12446.86s -> 12511.26s]  Bastard. Easy. Slow down. Battery. Still good on health. Shit. Sonic Sword is the best
[12511.26s -> 12545.51s]  option if you go in. Oh shit. My pants. I'm good. Battery. Get it out of the way. Oh shit.
[12546.07s -> 12600.47s]  Don't blow it like last time. Dead. Why is she invincible? My hair.
[12626.31s -> 12638.10s]  Jacob's was my mentor. I'd never kill him. I watched Master Jacob's teachings on video
[12638.10s -> 12645.46s]  over and over. Video. We never met in person. I watched him over and over again. I admit it.
[12645.46s -> 12654.39s]  I lost. Do it. How about kill yourself after you kill me? Sounds like a bit straight out of a
[12654.39s -> 12660.55s]  samurai movie. Don't it? Shut up. Shut up and kill me already. You've already dishonored me enough.
[12661.35s -> 12668.15s]  Do it yourself. I watched Master Jerma on stream over and over. What would you learn? I'll fight
[12668.15s -> 12675.43s]  you anytime, anywhere. How to wicked easily get headaches. How to sneeze and like get a hernia.
[12676.62s -> 12694.90s]  Which one? That's A. Clear time. A. How to slap yourself. How to put together masterful comedy.
[12695.54s -> 12715.67s]  I see what you're saying now. Thanks. Appreciate that. HP upgrade. How to backtrack. Not yet. What
[12715.67s -> 12736.23s]  else is in here? I can't talk. I think we just leave. Jerma, you must go forward.
[12736.95s -> 12747.37s]  Which Dark Souls did I beat on stream again? Multiple. More than one.
[12759.93s -> 12766.41s]  Then let her live. Wait, this was that guy? Welcome to the channel.
[12772.89s -> 12778.89s]  Kill when you can kill. That's bullshit. All I want to do is fight someone better than me.
[12779.85s -> 12782.81s]  She'll grow up. Why not kill her when she's stronger?
[12783.77s -> 12819.05s]  Yeah, then I'll kill her. You are sick. So are you. Oh damn. Got him for eight. Shinobu. Not anymore.
[12819.85s -> 12840.58s]  Moving up. It's gonna be hard missing her arm. Yeah, but we'll just get a robot one. We've
[12840.58s -> 12861.06s]  trained with the other hand. Why is there an ad for the game in the game? Uh, is there an ad?
[12861.54s -> 12866.18s]  Beathead videos. Just calling to let you know that one of the videos returned yesterday
[12866.18s -> 12872.18s]  wasn't one of ours. It doesn't have a label on it, but it seems to be a recording of a guy
[12872.98s -> 12880.04s]  pumping a pillow. The video you should have returned was, um, how to please a woman in bed
[12880.04s -> 12888.58s]  101 part two. Please return it to us soon. Thank you. Jesus Christ. Congratulations, Mr. Touchdown.
[12889.14s -> 12894.98s]  Your registration for the eighth UAA rank is now complete. In addition, we have faxed you
[12894.98s -> 12900.74s]  some information about the rankings in case you wish to continue your ascent. Please transfer
[12900.74s -> 12908.06s]  the money into the designated account. Have a nice day. About 300 grand? 500 grand? It's probably
[12908.06s -> 12916.07s]  three. 250? I'm gonna say 250. 250. Entry fee for your next rank fight is $250,000.
[12916.63s -> 12929.75s]  All right. Just lounge it. Every time we come back, we have to play with the cap. The phone
[12929.75s -> 12954.74s]  recording guy is, uh, Ryden's VA from Metal Gear Solid 2. Pretty cool. And for, and rising. Yeah.
[12955.54s -> 12967.38s]  Pretty cool. Gold Town is now open. Beefhead is now open. New part-time job is available.
[12968.34s -> 12980.12s]  Is there any, uh, is there a new sword available? Let's check. Let's check Beef Town. Excuse me.
[12980.44s -> 12992.78s]  Excuse me. Am I going to finish this game tonight? Uh, probably not. No, no way.
[12993.42s -> 13001.86s]  We'll do, we'll, we'll, we'll, I would assume we'll get it probably exactly. It's like a 12 hour
[13001.86s -> 13010.44s]  game, right? It's like 10 to 13, 10 to 14 hours, something like that. Probably do it over two
[13010.44s -> 13020.65s]  screens. Hey, how's biz? By the way, that thing you wanted hasn't come in yet. So what will it be
[13020.65s -> 13037.51s]  today? Video volume one. The title is Masked Panther. Tiger's Roar. Did I get it? That's
[13037.51s -> 13043.21s]  chilling, Travis. You've got the eye, man. The eye for cool. All right, let's get it. Let's go
[13043.21s -> 13056.50s]  watch it too. Don't die out there. Oh, for wrestling moves here. That makes sense. All right. We also
[13056.50s -> 13064.04s]  have to go to somewhere over here. I want to check the Katana place. Let's see if there's any new
[13064.04s -> 13074.09s]  stuff. Is this going to be a 100% gameplay type deal or are you just going to beat it?
[13075.29s -> 13084.34s]  Um, I don't, I wouldn't say a hundred percent, but I'm going to play it until I don't care. I mean,
[13084.34s -> 13092.46s]  I want to play. Ooh, there it is. T-shirt enough until I'm done. Cause I do want to play the second
[13092.46s -> 13108.60s]  one too. Probably not a hundred percent. A single finger on anything. Don't lay a finger on anything.
[13108.60s -> 13113.80s]  I'll kill you. All right. You got anything new? You do not have anything new, any new parts. You
[13113.80s -> 13129.67s]  do have new parts. Power up parts for Tsubaki exchanges the crystal parts inside the beam Katana
[13129.67s -> 13149.72s]  with pure crystals to greatly increase its output. Energy saving part. So this is for longer battery
[13149.72s -> 13157.67s]  life. Adds a, I thought that said motherfucker adds a motherfucker to the beam Katana increases
[13157.67s -> 13166.23s]  in it. I'll get this one. This is the power one. Let's go extraordinary power. I don't have enough
[13166.23s -> 13182.92s]  for the other one. Adds a fuck head to the Katana. I don't have enough money to get it. We have to
[13182.92s -> 13194.86s]  do more jobs. Can we get a little wink? I think I see 1200 points, not 75,000. Yes, you do. I
[13194.86s -> 13200.65s]  don't know. I don't want it. No, I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it. Wait, what?
[13200.65s -> 13218.98s]  You have 125,000. I need money. Wait, how much money do I have? Oh fuck. Okay. I don't know why
[13218.98s -> 13227.91s]  I thought that was 12,000, not 125. You did 75,000 points. Don't fuck yourself for raising the bit
[13227.91s -> 13243.14s]  amount for highlighted messages. You asshole. Well, you don't want to see a sea of purple
[13243.14s -> 13256.42s]  highlighted messages in chat wall stream. Well, you do. Yeah. Essentially before it was this chat
[13256.42s -> 13262.90s]  was just purple text. That's what it was. See now it's intended purpose of, and here we go.
[13262.90s -> 13271.35s]  Here we go. Open up the slot gates. Let's go. Imagine not having enough channel points.
[13276.22s -> 13283.98s]  Well, hold on a minute here. I, I, I decreased, I increased the one for highlighting a chat message,
[13283.98s -> 13292.28s]  but I decreased the unlock what the, uh, changing an emote that used to be 1250. That's now 750.
[13293.00s -> 13302.39s]  Just save for the wing. I told you that there's a huge play here where if you guys just don't spend
[13302.39s -> 13309.94s]  your channel points in like two years, you can all spend them to get me to wink and it'll ruin an
[13309.94s -> 13318.34s]  entire stream that will, it'll ruin everything. You will, you're guaranteed to fuck up at least
[13318.34s -> 13336.12s]  one full entire live stream like in six months. What do you want? What do you want? Make it in
[13336.12s -> 13344.20s]  the hundreds. I'm not going to go home to mommy. Leave me alone. I want to enjoy this moment.
[13344.76s -> 13352.04s]  I already got six K. You got six K. Find the seven Lovikov balls scattered across Santa
[13352.04s -> 13373.66s]  destroy and bring them to this drunk. How many points for a date? Uh, 500 million channel points,
[13375.98s -> 13379.66s]  which would take probably 10 years of me streaming. So I don't think you'll ever get
[13380.54s -> 13402.22s]  training. Here we go. Bench press, increasing your strength. Let's go. Tapping, tapping, tapping,
[13402.22s -> 13408.90s]  tapping. Just pull your points. No, it has to be from one single account.
[13417.98s -> 13424.68s]  I can't just pull all your points. How much to have a chat message go through text to speech?
[13425.88s -> 13429.40s]  Well, that would mean that I would have to have text to speech turned on in the stream and there
[13429.40s -> 13450.41s]  is, that is never going to happen. Why? Uh, because I don't like it. I don't like it. We've talked
[13450.41s -> 13454.09s]  about this already. There's somebody just talking while you're talking at the same time.
[13456.31s -> 13460.47s]  Somebody could just be talking over me talking, telling two completely different things at the
[13460.47s -> 13477.82s]  same time. You already, you already randomly just picked stuff from chats or read. Anyways,
[13477.82s -> 13497.77s]  it's pretty much text to speech already, except it's text to Jeremy. And there's another reason
[13497.77s -> 13503.37s]  why I don't like text to speech because not just for the stream, but a majority of these streams
[13503.37s -> 13511.96s]  are cut down and put on YouTube. And it's watching a video where there's just a TTS,
[13511.96s -> 13537.48s]  just talking on an edited video. It just, it's, it's messy. It's messy. Now he cares about YouTube.
[13540.07s -> 13546.07s]  I mean, I care, I care about the channel being like a watchable channel for people that don't
[13546.07s -> 13556.46s]  want to watch streams. Yes, of course I do. Yes, I do. The intended purpose of that channel is to
[13556.46s -> 13562.22s]  make it so people that don't have time or don't want to catch a stream, they, you know, I've got,
[13562.22s -> 13567.66s]  I only got maybe 15, 10, 20 minutes of time and, oh, but I did want to see some highlights from
[13567.66s -> 13574.49s]  that. There you go. That's, that's for you. There's VODs on Twitch. Yeah. For 60 days.
[13575.21s -> 13579.53s]  And then they get cut down. If you don't got time to sit through a six, seven plus hour stream,
[13579.53s -> 13590.44s]  you know, Barry, get the fuck out of here. All right. How did I get bronze on this one? Disgusting.
[13591.08s -> 13615.02s]  I actually watched the YouTube highlights, even if I watched the stream.
[13617.48s -> 13621.72s]  It's, it's for anybody that wants to, if you wanted to catch up on something, if,
[13622.52s -> 13627.16s]  you know, let's say you wanted to watch the last few streams, but by the last, you know, let's say,
[13627.16s -> 13630.92s]  oh yeah, I heard about that Simpsons hit and run stream where didn't he like fucking bite his
[13630.92s -> 13641.48s]  controller? Oh, wait, it's a 13 hour VOD. I, I don't really want to do that. I got like 10 minutes
[13641.48s -> 13664.63s]  today though. Went the wrong way. Shit. Make channel point 100 K for Nancy Drew again.
[13666.84s -> 13672.44s]  No, I can't start doing that. Cause that if you, if it's like, oh, for a hundred, I'll play like
[13672.44s -> 13676.52s]  league of legends at a hundred thousand channel points. I don't want to, I don't want to do that.
[13680.22s -> 13684.22s]  Nancy Drew is fine, but that's, you open up the, you open up the can of worms there.
[13684.30s -> 13699.86s]  No wrestling moves. They take too much time. Fuck. Oh, I'm sorry. Do it. Don't kill the CEO.
[13700.66s -> 13710.60s]  That's a, that's a gold right there. 100 K points. You have to be jumping DLC bronze.
[13711.48s -> 13752.71s]  All right. That's surprising. I thought I did. I had like 20, 15 seconds to spare any jobs.
[13752.79s -> 13768.36s]  Speed. Just nuke the boss. Third class. Not bad. The first rated God will give you a smile. Yeah.
[13768.36s -> 13780.79s]  Yeah. Yeah. Garbage collection. Cleanup Santa destroy, pick up as much garbage as you can within
[13780.79s -> 13794.92s]  the time limit. $1,000 for a bunch of garbage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[13797.74s -> 13802.78s]  Garbage collection. Clean up Santa destroy, pick up as much garbage as you can within the time limit.
[13803.74s -> 13805.75s]  $1,000 for each piece of garbage.
[13810.06s -> 13831.13s]  Garbage is the easiest one. I do remember this one being okay. Has redeemed 1 million points
[13831.13s -> 13849.21s]  for Lord of the Rings stream. Dude. Pog. Lord of the, really? That's a Pog champ right there.
[13849.21s -> 13855.24s]  I've never seen that. Naked Lord of the Rings stream. No, that would have to be a million
[13855.24s -> 13860.84s]  dollars. And then I, no, I'm not, no, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't stream naked for a million dollars.
[13861.08s -> 13877.13s]  What am I saying that for? I wouldn't do that. Unless, what? He put out a price.
[13884.04s -> 13887.48s]  Freedom and anarchy. There's nothing much here, really. Just remnants, cast offs,
[13887.48s -> 13892.92s]  ruins. The garbage that litters our streets. Mark the remnants of lives. You following me?
[13892.92s -> 13898.12s]  Each piece of garbage is a lost soul. So what better way to spend your life saving lost souls?
[13898.12s -> 13903.24s]  A true garbage man can bring peace to the dead. It's taken me 12 years to realize this truth.
[13904.04s -> 13909.24s]  You've got potential. A soul that can talk with garbage. The God of Garbage would watch
[13909.24s -> 13914.20s]  you and go save that garbage. No bikes that pollute the air are allowed in this environmentally
[13914.20s -> 13933.37s]  friendly mission. Pick up garbage. Get all the soda cans. Oh, this, I love this song. This is a
[13933.37s -> 13981.29s]  good song. Here I come. And easy. Shit. Now pick it up. That's a huge can. It was like 80 ounces.
[13991.74s -> 14000.31s]  Easy. Is it a thousand dollars per one? Yeah, this is like probably 50 grand. This is probably the
[14000.31s -> 14020.65s]  best pound for pound for money. Save your winks for April 1st. Maybe you'll get it. April 1st
[14020.65s -> 14032.73s]  is gonna be a wink stream. Terrible stream that's gonna be. Remind me to on like April 1st or March
[14032.73s -> 14038.73s]  30th or something to make sure the thing that I was planning on doing on April 1st or April 2nd
[14038.73s -> 14046.47s]  or whatever is something that does not require any fucking brain power. Any. I'm gonna have to
[14046.47s -> 14061.64s]  turn my cam on and wink like every five seconds. We want to damage your eyes. And I'm the serial
[14061.64s -> 14090.97s]  killer. Me. This guy. I'm the serial killer. It's 40 grand so far. 50 grand. Let's get it. 44. 45.

[14199.43s -> 14208.89s]  May you find your true path. I think this is what it is. How many points for you to
[14209.93s -> 14217.69s]  like nephews? He didn't even respond. What do you want me to say? Oh yeah. When's your
[14217.69s -> 14235.38s]  wedding? Oh me there at six o'clock. I don't know what's going on. What song am I singing?

[14250.07s -> 14255.93s]  Why do I have to invite you? Why didn't you invite me? I'm going right to the CEO as fast as I can.
[14274.58s -> 14277.30s]  That's pretty damn fast. That was like five seconds. Six seconds.
[14293.83s -> 14304.10s]  Just do this one over and over again. It's $50,000 every time. Do I have enough? Almost.
[14306.78s -> 14318.92s]  Let me try one of the other free kill ones. Farm pizza butt. Let me try to not get hit.
[14319.56s -> 14342.68s]  See if I can go three for three. Don't get hit. We got people to throw stuff.
[14350.70s -> 14371.43s]  Double. All right. Kill, kill, kill, kill it, kill it. Almost got hit. All right. Get in the corner.
[14372.07s -> 14376.94s]  Who's running? Anybody running over here? Nope. Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[14379.18s -> 14412.34s]  He's behind me. He's behind me. He's behind me. He's not behind me. One minute, 60 seconds.
[14412.50s -> 14440.79s]  If I kill you first. Actually sucked. Oh, this actually sucks. Back up, back up, back up.
[14440.79s -> 14457.98s]  Just blocking everything I'm doing. Got it. There is no such thing as bronze on these. You just do
[14457.98s -> 14468.49s]  it or you don't. $40,000. Why didn't you set my Christmas tree on fire? That was mean. My mom's
[14468.49s -> 14487.10s]  still crying. Why did I or why didn't I? Why didn't you set my Christmas tree on fire? Don't read this.
[14487.10s -> 14495.62s]  Well, it's using channel points, so I'm going to see it. All right. I'm going to buy the...
[14497.14s -> 14511.18s]  I've done all the other upgrades, right? Yeah, I did. I could buy like a new jacket. No, I want
[14511.18s -> 14531.99s]  that. No, I want that yellow jacket. Or that black one. Don't read this. You're going to get a new
[14531.99s -> 14549.11s]  inventory. Jackets. The yellow one. Which one? Black, tan, or that's just another kind of red.
[14549.91s -> 14568.55s]  Let's go black. What's this t-shirt? I want this one. Wait, there's more t-shirts. Oh, yeah.
[14573.34s -> 14592.84s]  What the hell was that? Okay. No, I want this one. I want this one. Jeans. Yeah. New belts.
[14595.53s -> 14603.27s]  No, keep this one. Who wants shoes? The anime ones are the expensive ones.
[14604.79s -> 14612.60s]  I didn't see the back of the jacket. I don't like it. I thought it was just black.
[14614.28s -> 14628.17s]  There's a big skull on it. I need to do another job. Let me do another one of the
[14628.17s -> 14636.25s]  don't get hit ones. That's enough money. Sunglasses? Not yet. That's like 30,000.
[14658.58s -> 14669.08s]  Let's do this one. Oh, I already did that one. Wait, is this a different one?
[14671.29s -> 14681.50s]  Don't these disappear from the map when you do them? What happened to Viscera cleanup detail?
[14681.50s -> 14694.44s]  Well, Joel. Were we supposed to do that? I thought we were going to keep talking and nobody explodes.
[14695.16s -> 14739.72s]  Don't get hit. No. Almost got hit. Almost got hit. All right. Sideway. Sideway. Side. Side. Side. Side.
[14739.72s -> 14755.34s]  Yes. No. What? I thought it was dead. I thought this guy was dead. I thought that guy was just
[14755.34s -> 14772.06s]  dead. What happened? What? Oh, come on. And I can't do it anymore. Fuck. I was waiting for a spawn.
[14772.06s -> 14776.22s]  I look over there. The guy's like a sliver of health left. And he just hit me just in the chest
[14776.22s -> 14793.19s]  or the whatever. It's only one more wave after that too. You can't win them all.
[14793.19s -> 14805.56s]  Quitter? It's not even on the mini-map anymore. I failed it. We should be able
[14805.56s -> 14809.94s]  to redeem a million channel points to have him delete his channel. No,
[14809.94s -> 14814.18s]  a million channel points would be like you get to stream. You get to stream on Jerma's account
[14814.18s -> 14858.20s]  for five minutes. Oh fuck. He's going to hit me from behind. Good. Turn. Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!
[14859.32s -> 14871.78s]  Now I'm in trouble.
[14871.82s -> 14873.58s]  Wow.
[14875.10s -> 14877.82s]  Fuck I knew it. I had the wrestling move fucked it up
[14878.34s -> 14887.28s]  It's okay. That's I knew it was gonna happen wrestling move fucked it up and I lost it. It's fine. Let's do a jump
[14887.80s -> 14891.38s]  Does your mom know that you hate Joel?
[14891.90s -> 14907.50s]  why show
[14907.94s -> 14912.59s]  God damn it. I have to do after like mola lawn. Okay, I'm picking up trash and then I'm like, that's it
[14925.53s -> 14928.02s]  He didn't jump in time. Oh

[14932.05s -> 14937.15s]  Dermot spray them with water. It's chat spray chat with water
[14937.93s -> 14944.08s]  Wait, hold on. I can do this one. All right, let's go. Come on. Don't get fucking hit
[14944.08s -> 14948.16s]  I almost I did like three in a row. I'm gonna get hit three times in a row now
[14948.68s -> 14954.25s]  Dermot, if you're reading this copy Cheeto chicken
[14954.69s -> 14982.43s]  You got it. You blocked every one of my moves. I went up. I went down. I went down down. I went up
[14982.43s -> 14984.63s]  I went down. I went up up up down and he blocked them all
[14985.35s -> 14992.06s]  Dude, you fucking suck, bro
[14992.42s -> 14993.62s]  Oh
[14993.62s -> 14994.82s]  Yeah
[14994.82s -> 14998.68s]  Ross, dude. Hey, I think you can't do shit
[15001.76s -> 15007.70s]  Let's pick up garbage
[15009.02s -> 15011.78s]  Any plans for another emote contest not anytime immediately
[15012.18s -> 15020.75s]  Hi pasta and the Tupperware on the bottom shelf on the fridge when you're done streaming. Love you
[15021.31s -> 15033.49s]  pasta and the white whatever Tupperware what wait wait this pasta this wait is pasta
[15033.85s -> 15038.93s]  Oh
[15038.93s -> 15043.47s]  Available now

[15056.42s -> 15061.55s]  No, not yet. That's head. I'm still playing no more heroes
[15062.13s -> 15076.09s]  Trash time. I'm like eight feet tall. Why am I so tall right now?
[15081.34s -> 15082.58s]  Ledge
[15082.58s -> 15086.24s]  shitty route
[15086.24s -> 15088.64s]  Actually really really bad route. I gotta get 50
[15089.28s -> 15091.38s]  I'm gonna focus here
[15091.38s -> 15096.35s]  terrible route
[15096.35s -> 15098.53s]  This is not how you get 50
[15099.63s -> 15112.07s]  What an awful fucking job. I'm embarrassed
[15112.67s -> 15114.67s]  I'm actually embarrassed right now
[15114.87s -> 15117.25s]  My face is like slowly starting to turn red
[15118.35s -> 15125.18s]  And my speech is starting a little different. You know, I mean like you never see god damn it. Oh
[15131.82s -> 15153.22s]  Why did I just hit the edge in operation what the fuck was that don't read whatever he's an electric fence I
[15161.96s -> 15163.96s]  Wonder what the speedrunners of this game do
[15164.91s -> 15171.23s]  Do you just rush to garbage and then you collect garbage like 50 times is the best possible route and then just blow through the rest
[15171.23s -> 15172.47s]  of the game
[15172.47s -> 15179.73s]  Which speed run it has to be a speeder. This is this against popular
[15180.33s -> 15184.43s]  This is a fairly. I mean, it's not insanely popular, but it's popular enough
[15185.29s -> 15205.52s]  It's probably a glitch. Yeah, I've seen roblox roblox games look better than this
[15206.16s -> 15210.90s]  That's just it's just
[15211.42s -> 15213.10s]  objectively incorrect
[15213.10s -> 15223.85s]  Are you you know, are you actually gonna be like talk about no more heroes like that
[15224.69s -> 15245.26s]  Go what I get last time 46
[15246.39s -> 15264.26s]  47
[15264.26s -> 15268.14s]  I got it. Thank God good account at the buzzer
[15270.85s -> 15278.90s]  29 the world record is an hour and 30 minutes or so. That's crazy
[15279.42s -> 15292.59s]  All right, let's pay that fee move on to assassin number seven
[15293.27s -> 15324.11s]  Yeah, let it die is bad. I streamed let it die
[15324.83s -> 15340.95s]  The first six but probably like the first four hours of let it die was fun sort of and then it just kind of
[15341.75s -> 15344.03s]  It was not I didn't didn't keep me
[15344.91s -> 15359.07s]  Didn't keep me at all. I just walk across the goddamn street. It's right here

[16741.75s -> 16749.51s]  People that think oh deep to the this stream. It doesn't read chat. I've read almost everything almost maybe like 40% of everything
[16750.11s -> 16766.48s]  Close enough new move Travis. Remember now the most fundamental among fundamental suplexes made famous in Calgary
[16766.88s -> 16770.80s]  It's the all-natural amusement machine the German suplex. I don't know
[16771.92s -> 16798.06s]  Don't I already know how to do it. I've done that a few times. That's the dragon suplex
[16799.16s -> 16818.79s]  German suplex is just around the waist right and backwards. It's not even full health
[16820.24s -> 16823.16s]  Like edit for a cutscene cuz that would suck if I don't

[16852.80s -> 16860.36s]  I think they can just say anything. It's crazy. But anyway, I'm here. I made it on time. That's the important thing, right? I
[16861.20s -> 16863.20s]  Take it. You're mr. 8
[16863.32s -> 16866.28s]  You you're ranked not me
[16866.92s -> 16873.32s]  Well, actually it is me. I remember this guy that that's great. Never mind then you've got a job to do
[16873.60s -> 16879.12s]  But first I need some time to get ready. Would you mind turning the other way? I need some privacy privacy
[16879.64s -> 16881.64s]  Yes, I need to prepare
[16882.24s -> 16883.44s]  whatever
[16883.44s -> 16889.72s]  Don't mind me pretend. I'm not even here. I just need you to look the other way for a second a second
[16889.80s -> 16894.12s]  Yes, just a split second. I don't think it's too much to ask do you?
[16894.80s -> 16896.80s]  Then we can get on with our fight
[16897.32s -> 16899.72s]  That is correct. All right
[16903.97s -> 16905.97s]  bastard dishonor, oh

[16911.34s -> 16916.48s]  Whoa, that was close for a second there. I forgot that you were a killer
[16917.00s -> 16922.29s]  Sorry if I scared you I didn't mean to do that. Something's wrong with me today. I
[16923.41s -> 16925.21s]  Let my guard down
[16925.21s -> 16928.73s]  Getting sloppy. I got changed fast. I
[16929.33s -> 16936.16s]  Asked you something. Yeah, what is it? Mr. Cosplay? We're both assassins, right?
[16936.68s -> 16941.32s]  Why do we have to kill each other? Anyway, this game is ridiculous. I love it. It's absolutely meaningless
[16941.88s -> 16945.12s]  It's about determining who's best. That's what it's about
[16946.16s -> 16948.00s]  Can't argue with that
[16948.00s -> 16950.00s]  Well, then let's get started
[16950.64s -> 16955.31s]  What you want to shake hands? You just tried to kill me from behind
[16956.17s -> 16958.17s]  Not killers at least for now

[17001.00s -> 17003.00s]  I'm just gonna kill me
[17003.52s -> 17008.04s]  Seriously, I think I might really die from laughter. It hurts
[17016.54s -> 17026.22s]  He ate the blueberries and look at you you look like you're dead I guess it's time for a wake-up call
[17033.29s -> 17038.63s]  This is where it gets good good night
[17041.59s -> 17047.75s]  This is just what it's like to play Smash Brothers online

[17616.02s -> 17620.74s]  Title is how to please a woman in bed 101 part three. Oh
[17621.34s -> 17626.34s]  One of the girls here said that you might need a new pillow cover for this one, you know, just for protection
[17627.06s -> 17629.06s]  Thank you
[17632.10s -> 17637.66s]  Congratulations, mr. Touchdown your registration for the seventh UAA rank is now complete
[17638.10s -> 17644.66s]  As always we have facts you some information about the rankings in case you wish to continue your set
[17645.26s -> 17650.70s]  Please transfer the money into the designated term and get your nasty shit off the desk where you and Kim eat
[17652.58s -> 17657.38s]  We don't we mean Kim don't eat dinner up here on where my computer desk is
[17658.74s -> 17661.36s]  Why would we do that?
[17662.86s -> 17664.02s]  300 gram
[17664.02s -> 17679.32s]  You're hungry. You're in your one-room apartment
[17680.24s -> 17694.83s]  Well wouldn't if that wouldn't she just be in here she is
[17695.71s -> 17723.08s]  Save it again end of the stream. Not yet
[17730.08s -> 17735.98s]  No, man, that's end of the stream voice. No, how is that end of the stream voice?
[17737.06s -> 17743.90s]  New job. What is it? Why do I know like another katana? I'm almost ranked six. Where's the new katana?
[17744.42s -> 17755.11s]  There's a stupidest way to take a left
[17766.02s -> 17784.65s]  And we got to go to the gym we got to get the katana part if it's available
[17785.49s -> 17791.97s]  What the new model dumbass otaku? What's it look like? Of course, it's not done yet
[17801.95s -> 17816.46s]  Right to the gym no, no, no
[17817.54s -> 17843.54s]  Okay back to the gym. So we're this way take a right
[17844.22s -> 17850.13s]  Remember drive on the right side of the road. What are you doing? Remember when I was playing Grand Theft Auto and how?
[17850.73s -> 17855.09s]  Furious people would get because I only drive on the left side of the road into traffic. I
[17856.55s -> 17863.38s]  Remember it's cuz it's easier. You don't have to wait for people to burn you. You can go just weave around
[17864.02s -> 17874.46s]  All right bench press again
[17899.22s -> 17902.23s]  This hurts
[17902.27s -> 17910.46s]  Not gonna make it I have 30 seconds
[17911.18s -> 17925.76s]  Pepsi versus coke
[17926.04s -> 17940.70s]  coke
[17940.70s -> 17944.16s]  It's the same. No, it's a little different
[17944.92s -> 17949.44s]  Coke is spicier than Pepsi. Pepsi is smoother
[17950.04s -> 17956.80s]  Coke has a little bit more of a bite than Pepsi does Pepsi's tastes almost like it's not flat, but it's like a little spicier
[17956.80s -> 17958.80s]  It's got a little more bite than
[17959.32s -> 17968.41s]  Pepsi does
[17969.81s -> 17974.24s]  Dr. Pepper is the best
[17974.24s -> 17981.54s]  You know what actually in recent years, you know, it's really been taken over as the drink of choice for me for a soda
[17982.28s -> 17987.54s]  It's just regular ass sprite. I've kind of like it. It's crisp
[17988.10s -> 17994.39s]  It's refreshing I actually really like it just a little bit just you know, like those little baby cans
[17995.15s -> 18002.93s]  The ones that are like they look like they're like a jokey little display like a cartoon can I like those you just that's it
[18002.93s -> 18005.01s]  Just just a little one. Not just enough
[18005.57s -> 18021.11s]  All righty. Three hundred thousand. Let's go do the new job and we should unlock more assassin missions, which I haven't done all
[18022.99s -> 18027.03s]  McCrory, no, no, no, I don't like I don't like soda water like that
[18027.83s -> 18031.07s]  For me if I'm gonna drink soda, I gotta go all the way
[18031.79s -> 18037.95s]  Drinking something like LaCroix is like halfway for me. And it's just like if I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go the whole way
[18038.59s -> 18055.38s]  Where's Mountain Dew? No Mountain Dew sucks. No, I don't know. They somehow made it worse over the last ten years
[18055.38s -> 18060.26s]  I don't know what they did. It's just it's too sugary. I don't know. It's like 44 grams of sugar or something
[18061.54s -> 18068.56s]  It's not too bad the first rate God, that's me. Okay
[18069.12s -> 18075.40s]  Gassed in fill up cars with gas $2,000 for each car filled up. Absolutely
[18079.24s -> 18083.82s]  You know, what has objectively gotten worse is cool ranch Doritos. Oh
[18085.70s -> 18088.40s]  I don't I haven't had cool ranch Doritos in a long time
[18089.06s -> 18102.86s]  No, it's not that I had cool ranch Doritos. I don't even really eat regular Doritos anymore. I mean I
[18103.50s -> 18106.95s]  Not really
[18106.95s -> 18112.25s]  Cheese, it's a nice snack choice if I just want to just crunch on something
[18115.20s -> 18116.60s]  Oh, you know what's awesome?
[18116.60s -> 18123.86s]  Dill pickle lays potato chips. They are very very very great
[18124.50s -> 18131.19s]  They had trust me. They're pretty good Dill
[18131.87s -> 18133.59s]  lays potato chips
[18133.59s -> 18139.77s]  Rules the unspoken rules standard destroy dictate perseverance perseverance lends to money
[18140.09s -> 18143.69s]  Which during leads to wealth the world will forever remain closed to those who do not persevere
[18144.25s -> 18149.85s]  The god of gasoline is cruel lose your perseverance and you'll burn up. That is what perseverance means
[18150.69s -> 18152.69s]  Get working get working
[18153.29s -> 18158.00s]  Kettle chips. Yeah, I like kettle chips do that. They're up there at like a tier
[18158.68s -> 18165.42s]  Press the B button to pump gas into the car. Be sure to fill her up just the right amount. I
[18167.44s -> 18169.74s]  Don't remember this one
[18182.62s -> 18184.98s]  That person didn't even get any gas
[18185.62s -> 18192.42s]  The person drove in and just drove out with the same amount
[18192.98s -> 18210.45s]  Fuck this one actually sucks. Was that not it?
[18211.01s -> 18233.32s]  That's perfect. That was a pixel. Perfect. Well, you can go over you just can't go under. Okay. Well, it's it filled to the right amount
[18233.84s -> 18245.40s]  I'm overfilling it. Isn't part of the job that it's supposed to suck
[18259.44s -> 18262.56s]  I was gonna say yeah, that was a Mario damage sound
[18263.44s -> 18269.40s]  But I made a Mario reference like yesterday. I you got I can't make too many in a row
[18282.22s -> 18294.36s]  That was perfect. Let's go. It did sound just like it. What cut look at this car
[18295.16s -> 18299.56s]  What was that car that car didn't make any sense that car that car was made out of marshmallows
[18300.28s -> 18315.76s]  Goddamn it. It's a birthday cake car
[18319.23s -> 18324.27s]  Big cake that really isn't car cake. It's a birthday cake
[18327.00s -> 18329.48s]  These are hard to do. Look, it's gonna blow up on me
[18337.21s -> 18339.93s]  Was it $3,000 per car? That's actually gonna be a lot of money
[18350.39s -> 18352.39s]  20 probably 23
[18353.91s -> 18355.27s]  23
[18355.27s -> 18358.15s]  just as many
[18358.43s -> 18365.18s]  Cars filled up as there are categories for the New Year's Eve stream. You go ahead and check out the
[18365.78s -> 18367.78s]  Voting there is a poll going on right now
[18368.38s -> 18370.06s]  23 categories
[18370.06s -> 18377.60s]  Get your votes in the best and worst shit that happened on this stream over the last year
[18377.60s -> 18386.74s]  A lot of interesting stuff on there. Take that poll poll is open until the 31st at 12 p.m
[18386.74s -> 18393.96s]  Pacific and then that evening Pacific we will watch the ball drop and go over all the nominations and see what you guys selected
[18394.62s -> 18398.51s]  He's doing an ad. I'm doing an ad from my own stream
[18399.23s -> 18401.23s]  So the money just went in a circle
[18405.95s -> 18421.76s]  23 of you start from zero. Well 24 if you count the would you recommend Jerma to a friend? Oh a new mission nice
[18422.28s -> 18427.28s]  New assassin mission. Hopefully it's worth a hundred thousand dollars
[18428.04s -> 18438.23s]  Good job, what we got? So we left up pizza, but returns
[18438.83s -> 18443.23s]  Kills many as you can within the time the mission ends when time runs out. So I just to kill as many people as possible
[18444.87s -> 18446.79s]  4,000 per kill that's a lot
[18446.79s -> 18450.62s]  Kill a hundred enemies mission ends when all targets are dead
[18451.14s -> 18455.56s]  No time limit. Just that's a hundred people. That's a lot of people though
[18455.56s -> 18459.88s]  I feel like that's not good on a batting killing spree
[18459.88s -> 18466.57s]  We've done this before and then kill all the enemies within the time limit dark side mode will be activated mission ends
[18468.21s -> 18476.24s]  I'll do this one. This is the power
[18478.56s -> 18493.99s]  Let's go
[18495.24s -> 18496.68s]  Travis
[18496.68s -> 18499.72s]  100 enemy one is the one I used for big money
[18500.64s -> 18506.61s]  well, eventually when you get strong enough that you upgrade your attack power and you upgrade your katana to a point where
[18506.97s -> 18508.97s]  You can kill people in one hit
[18509.29s -> 18512.09s]  So that mission probably becomes pretty easy money
[18513.13s -> 18515.61s]  once you have like the third katana and
[18515.97s -> 18519.25s]  And plus seven in attack power
[18520.33s -> 18522.57s]  Big money. We'll try this
[18523.21s -> 18545.54s]  3k per kill is more money than 90k for a hundred
[18546.54s -> 18551.42s]  That's true. But you do you do have a time limit on the other one. No wonder
[18553.55s -> 18555.92s]  All right dark side here we go
[18562.27s -> 18572.42s]  Trying to remember the way the wee buttons like ZC it's
[18574.34s -> 18587.95s]  At least we get to see these animations no, don't slap the button
[18589.95s -> 18593.92s]  They kill both
[18593.92s -> 18601.79s]  For some reason I know B is the trigger on the week
[18602.51s -> 18607.43s]  But B for me, I don't know. I feel like it's a it's the face button up here at my thumb
[18608.23s -> 18614.09s]  It's been a while since I felt a wee controller. It's been like two years, right?
[18615.19s -> 18617.19s]  What's last we stream?
[18617.31s -> 18624.03s]  What was the last we stream?
[18625.79s -> 18628.22s]  I'm ever played the Wario. Where's
[18628.22s -> 18631.93s]  You
[18632.17s -> 18638.88s]  What else did I play on we I did the the new Matt the mad dog games right all those laser disc ones
[18639.92s -> 18646.73s]  Don't pickle flavored laze tastes like ass and you know it you tasteless boomer
[18647.43s -> 18649.80s]  Why can I move?
[18649.80s -> 18667.37s]  Did I not play rhythm heaven? I bet you 20 was gold too. Fuck we need a bar. You were I already played it
[18667.37s -> 18669.21s]  I did all of it
[18669.21s -> 18679.44s]  You didn't I'll do it. Did I swear to God? I didn't I didn't I play it
[18680.04s -> 18683.40s]  the one for we
[18683.40s -> 18688.08s]  The
[18688.32s -> 18693.68s]  Yeah, post for the fans. Am I just thinking of a cool part of that game that I didn't play didn't I play that?
[18694.56s -> 18705.61s]  No, we made videos of it. Oh, that's right. It was a green screen entry
[18712.38s -> 18719.88s]  Yeah, and then she goes whoa, you know big guy, yeah, I know that song
[18735.97s -> 18740.31s]  Did you do mad world I have never played mad world I didn't play mad world because it
[18740.91s -> 18742.91s]  I did it hurts my eyes
[18743.27s -> 18751.85s]  Mad world to me was like looking at a newspaper. It just that kind of hurts my head. I
[18752.45s -> 18759.39s]  Wish they did a remastered mode where they just like call it in all the spaces. Maybe I would want to play it
[18759.99s -> 18778.30s]  All right, don't get hit don't get hit don't get hit
[18788.78s -> 18805.05s]  Whoa, watch it. It was this guy again. Remember this guy. He wasn't even on the screen
[18806.23s -> 18818.64s]  Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it
[18828.20s -> 18830.20s]  Jesus holy fuck. I just got it like scared
[18830.96s -> 18838.32s]  like actually scared
[18838.72s -> 18847.58s]  Now you fucker I knew he's gonna go through
[18849.10s -> 18853.78s]  Bros the screen froze for a second and I knew it was gonna stop
[18853.78s -> 18858.74s]  I saw it happening from my fucking face and it was the I knew it
[18859.02s -> 18863.90s]  Right when I hit him for that last time and it paused to do the swipe. Hey
[18864.58s -> 18876.42s]  Oh
[18876.74s -> 18878.74s]  Damage that was the end to shit
[18879.14s -> 18891.89s]  I'll get this one. Oh, I'm so disappointed by that and I'm I got
[18900.93s -> 18906.45s]  Fuck this message, but it's funny. Don't read this. You now have bad luck for the next three days
[18906.45s -> 18912.57s]  This is real voodoo. You can only undo this by spinning around three times on camera while screaming
[18913.41s -> 18920.12s]  That's stupid. Oh
[18920.12s -> 18922.12s]  No, I've been cursed
[18922.72s -> 18926.44s]  Don't get it
[18926.44s -> 18934.00s]  Did it's real voodoo I have to be careful. All right, I gotta pay attention because I want this 50 grand
[18935.00s -> 18939.87s]  Almost baited me there, didn't you?
[18948.67s -> 18969.94s]  Don't fucking do this to me get the guy with the lightsaber first back it up
[18971.80s -> 18983.56s]  No, I'll do it
[18996.64s -> 18999.00s]  I'm not doing that. Fuck. I don't care curse me. I
[19003.35s -> 19008.34s]  Can't do that here right now. There's not enough room. You can
[19013.97s -> 19020.44s]  big my arms
[19021.40s -> 19055.45s]  Take your curse off motherfucker. I have removed the curse. Oh, thank God. Where's my bike?
[19055.61s -> 19067.33s]  What I have two chairs in the room. Sometimes Kim comes up here and sits down and we
[19068.01s -> 19072.07s]  hang out look at stuff play game or
[19072.63s -> 19080.17s]  There's a ball term. It's time for you to eat dinner
[19081.81s -> 19086.25s]  It's not time for me to look I'm gonna do this one more mission and then we're gonna finish this tomorrow
[19086.97s -> 19091.84s]  And by mission, I mean like assassin number six
[19092.56s -> 19099.70s]  Not one more of these money missions. I mean like a full assassin ways another ball
[19102.96s -> 19113.69s]  Do you eat dinner at your desk? I don't eat dinner at my desk. All right, let me get one of these
[19113.69s -> 19117.41s]  I haven't done one of these in a long time. I did like the first two or three in a row without a problem
[19118.33s -> 19140.58s]  Get hit don't get hit
[19140.58s -> 19142.58s]  I
[19181.44s -> 19187.04s]  Was okay fuck I'm just gonna do a regular mission these are too I get it. Oh my god. Damn it
[19187.68s -> 19193.76s]  These ones are fucking hard. Ah
[19194.48s -> 19207.28s]  That's worse meltdown. What I'm just expelling demons out of my mouth. How is that a meltdown?
[19207.76s -> 19225.42s]  I'm trying to pick up trash. It's reliable these like $15 if to know it just get it out of dumpsters
[19225.94s -> 19228.56s]  Yeah, let's just get it out of a dumpster
[19228.64s -> 19256.41s]  Yeah, I need to do this like three dumpsters go play Lego Star Wars the complete saga. It's the best game
[19256.41s -> 19262.24s]  I played this whole decade
[19262.48s -> 19289.12s]  Okay, just two more. What is back here? What's on the mini map there? You gotta play the Lord of the Rings games
[19289.32s -> 19292.60s]  Yeah, the the Lord of the Rings ps2 games are on the list
[19293.28s -> 19297.42s]  And so is Mickey Mouse the magical quest starring Mickey Mouse
[19298.10s -> 19318.67s]  It's a hell of a game. Yeah, it's really good. You have a lot to play. Yeah, there's a lot of games to play
[19319.15s -> 19322.67s]  I give him my bike
[19330.00s -> 19356.12s]  Feel bad for that guy. I just need one more. I need it two more dumpsters and then get me on to the next battle. I
[19356.76s -> 19358.20s]  need a dumpster
[19358.20s -> 19362.28s]  anywhere dumpster
[19362.76s -> 19372.17s]  Dumpster there's gotta be a dumpster in here play Peggle. I think Peggle at least a few times
[19372.83s -> 19401.97s]  Seriously, what was that ball in here? I must I have a I got like four of these in a row
[19403.25s -> 19424.84s]  Where's WarioWare? I already streamed WarioWare. I did all of it. You play urban chaos. I think so was on the ps2 list
[19425.32s -> 19437.70s]  Do it more well tell Nintendo to make them they made one 12 years ago
[19438.34s -> 19450.00s]  And then they made a fake half WarioWare game. Where's the WarioWare switch?
[19450.60s -> 19463.91s]  Where is it? I'll be fair to Nintendo though. This probably I mean how many more different types of weird?
[19464.99s -> 19466.99s]  Micro games do you think they can come up with?
[19467.35s -> 19473.04s]  Maybe they could do some more
[19473.08s -> 19474.80s]  but
[19474.80s -> 19484.12s]  They could but maybe this don't feel like it but they have had a bunch of new games released
[19484.12s -> 19489.85s]  They could do a lot of it's t-shirts. It's kind of not what I wanted
[19501.91s -> 19511.70s]  Dumpster give me a dumpster. I need two dumpsters
[19512.26s -> 19518.27s]  There's one
[19518.27s -> 19524.54s]  Alright, I need
[19524.82s -> 19534.81s]  $400

[20486.86s -> 20490.64s]  Of course every time
[20491.44s -> 20494.96s]  Every time I could have used that I could have used that shit. I
[20496.24s -> 20507.03s]  Would have loved to have had that five minutes ago. I

[20555.51s -> 20558.36s]  I guess to be fair. It's
[20558.36s -> 20564.28s]  It's just the beach. The other levels are in buildings. So I guess maybe it's the same length, but
[20565.16s -> 20570.65s]  Car that's what I want
[20582.01s -> 20589.80s]  After you after you swing for finishing blow swing again during the slow-mo motion part to cut for more people

[21601.16s -> 21606.91s]  That's fun, this is not mercy
[21607.59s -> 21614.87s]  You can't kill a woman did say no mercy. So if you can't kill a woman you are less than a thug
[21615.23s -> 21617.23s]  You'll never make it to the top
[21617.83s -> 21627.01s]  That's okay. I seem to have a thing for stupid pathetic men like you. I can accept defeat. It comes from your hand
[21627.01s -> 21629.71s]  I will let you in on a secret
[21630.75s -> 21633.03s]  Assassins must die when they lose

[21686.09s -> 21689.73s]  What was her name? That's a special grenade. That is not important anymore
[21690.37s -> 21691.73s]  You're right
[21691.73s -> 21693.73s]  But I owe her at least that
[21694.13s -> 21697.04s]  Holly Summers born is no

[21781.97s -> 21793.61s]  Couldn't do that before it was grayed out Holly. I was late in saying this but I love your soul
[21794.13s -> 21796.13s]  Rest in peace
[21798.26s -> 21801.02s]  That was not a respectful way to put somebody to a grave
[21802.50s -> 21805.90s]  Could have leaned out in the late
[21807.98s -> 21809.46s]  Sand
[21809.46s -> 21811.22s]  He just
[21811.22s -> 21812.70s]  dropped her

[21849.52s -> 21868.45s]  I'm gonna see the cards and I want to see the new weapon and I'll play with the cat. Yes
[21873.19s -> 21878.67s]  How many videos do I have why would they still allow me to

[21896.25s -> 21900.65s]  UAA rank is complete. We look forward to hearing from you
[21904.08s -> 21906.44s]  350 I think it goes up by 50,000 every time
[21907.08s -> 21910.51s]  Yeah

[21990.54s -> 22005.58s]  I just want to see it. I'm gonna look at it. Maybe I will buy it. Oh, righty
[22007.14s -> 22008.74s]  Let's take it
[22008.74s -> 22011.30s]  It'll be too expensive. Anyways, yeah
[22016.60s -> 22022.51s]  Job, let's go. See the beam katana upgrade
[22023.51s -> 22044.00s]  You gotta go through here in the ass in the ass
[22044.80s -> 22046.36s]  and
[22046.36s -> 22052.31s]  Turn TV is the worst emote on twitch. I'm actually stuck. I can't drive this
[22057.40s -> 22065.07s]  Yeah, I mean, that's I'm not gonna what am I gonna get rid of it? Why would I delete any emotes right now?
[22065.75s -> 22067.92s]  When I
[22067.92s -> 22073.29s]  It's doing its best
[22073.29s -> 22084.84s]  Is it the most use this has ever gotten did somebody just do a giant F and then say fuck you in the middle scroll up
[22084.84s -> 22086.00s]  Did you see that?
[22086.00s -> 22092.09s]  One two three four counts five accounts made a giant F and it says fuck you in the middle
[22092.69s -> 22096.48s]  Somebody grab I want to screenshot that that's insane
[22097.12s -> 22108.50s]  It was unintentional
[22110.26s -> 22114.66s]  Where the hell did you get this I swear you can get your hands on almost anything these days
[22115.02s -> 22124.30s]  Scares me to think a thing like this is out in the world. See what I can do. It's not available yet
[22130.46s -> 22135.84s]  Did you get it let's see
[22135.84s -> 22144.36s]  Fuck you with a big F. That's insane. That's awesome
[22144.92s -> 22154.32s]  All right, that's uh, that's gonna wrap it up for tonight. That's a that's a perfect clean six hours
[22155.00s -> 22159.64s]  Plus that gives us time to do probably like six to seven hours tomorrow to finish the game
[22160.16s -> 22163.51s]  And then after that is the New Year's Eve stream
[22166.35s -> 22174.56s]  Save it again. I just did I just did right before. Oh, well, you want to save because I gave them. Yeah. Yeah
[22175.12s -> 22186.11s]  I'll do it again. What time is the New Year's stream gonna start 6 p.m. Pacific is the New Year's Eve stream
[22186.59s -> 22192.03s]  starting at 9 Eastern it's to make sure that we can do all the festivities and
[22192.47s -> 22194.47s]  Count down the ball drop
[22194.83s -> 22212.78s]  Eastern time and then for Pacific time, I'm going to spend it with Kim. I did not spend New Year's Eve with Kim last year
[22213.70s -> 22217.26s]  So her and I are going to hang out
[22217.98s -> 22224.48s]  stuck again
[22224.48s -> 22226.92s]  I'm trying to back up and I won't let me
[22227.52s -> 22248.30s]  I'm right in front of a cop too. Whatever. I'm just walking. Yeah, we'll continue no more heroes tomorrow. We will beat it tomorrow and
[22248.90s -> 22254.15s]  then after New Year's
[22254.69s -> 22260.53s]  Depending on how into this I am how into no more heroes. We might just do the second one right after
[22261.05s -> 22266.09s]  Well, maybe we'll do it the week after maybe next but do something else for a few streams. I don't know
[22266.81s -> 22273.42s]  But I do want to play the second one. All right, save it here
[22282.27s -> 22288.14s]  Rhythm heaven rhythm rhythm heaven. I will I will we but I will play rhythm heaven. I swear
[22289.10s -> 22299.67s]  All right. I will see you guys tomorrow. If you stick around we're gonna do the bits and subs and everything
[22300.43s -> 22304.19s]  Thanks again for watching
[22304.19s -> 22311.92s]  Maybe we'll see you tomorrow that will conclude part one of no more heroes. We addition
[22312.76s -> 22313.76s]  quotes
[22313.76s -> 22338.70s]  This music's pretty good. But you know, pretty good pretty good. He doesn't he doesn't hate. What am I? He hates the cat
[22339.46s -> 22341.46s]  What do you mean? He hates the cat?
[22341.58s -> 22356.59s]  That's not true. Let's get the fun. I'll get this music. I played with the cat every time. I
[22361.54s -> 22369.12s]  Played with the cat every time. All right, let's go. Let's do it. Let's do bits
[22369.72s -> 22372.04s]  bits bits bits bits we had a
[22372.56s -> 22375.57s]  Lot of subs came in today
[22375.73s -> 22377.73s]  derma sucks gave a shitload
[22377.97s -> 22390.95s]  German sucks gave 20 community subs right at the very beginning of the stream too. So thank you for that clown connoisseur gave 500 bits
[22390.95s -> 22392.83s]  Hey German, thank you for the content
[22392.83s -> 22399.44s]  Thank you the five dolls clown connoisseur. I'm glad you have fun. Glad you like it
[22403.54s -> 22411.94s]  Evil program. Thanks in 300 bits. No message. Just three dollars 300 bits. Thank you evil program right after that

[22420.03s -> 22422.35s]  500 bits. Thank you. Thanks a lot guys
[22425.24s -> 22431.92s]  Gnarly gave 250 here. I feel like you just streamed this game as an excuse to put Travis in the next rumble and honestly
[22431.92s -> 22436.99s]  I'm off for it. He wouldn't be a very hard character to make
[22437.59s -> 22452.01s]  Just brown jacket glasses and that hair would be pretty easy character to make when is the next rumble? We talked about the next rumble
[22453.57s -> 22459.47s]  Yesterday at the end of the stream and I don't really have any details for it, but the next rumble is gonna be a charity rumble
[22460.11s -> 22474.08s]  So I'll give more details on that when I have them fruit charity. Well, it won't be live-action. It'll be in a game
[22474.60s -> 22482.66s]  But thank you, darling. Thank you sad vague of the 250 man. Nancy Drew finally got barely interesting. I'm really glad you hung with it
[22482.66s -> 22485.54s]  It's at least becoming a wannabe Godhand poser game now
[22486.14s -> 22493.66s]  Are you implying that no more heroes is a poser Godham Godhand poser game?
[22494.26s -> 22503.38s]  It's not there are no lightsabers in God him
[22503.94s -> 22511.02s]  Hey Bacchus, thanks for the 500 bits. I'm so glad you love this game, too. It's my favorite game on the Wii
[22511.02s -> 22515.21s]  It's probably one of the best games to come out on the Wii. I don't have the Wiimote in my hand
[22515.21s -> 22517.21s]  And I'm still moving my arms around like an idiot
[22517.51s -> 22527.65s]  Yeah, it's one of the best games to come out on the platform both one and two
[22528.45s -> 22533.12s]  Thank you Bacchus though for sure

[22561.77s -> 22563.97s]  Gooberry juice. Thanks for the 500 bits Gooberry
[22564.29s -> 22566.95s]  This is definitely one of my favorite games and I'm so happy you're playing it
[22567.17s -> 22571.85s]  But I guess I wasn't prepared for how much the Drew crew would hate it
[22572.69s -> 22575.45s]  Because of the shame I now feel I'm going to go home
[22576.49s -> 22581.52s]  watch anime take a piss and
[22582.52s -> 22599.23s]  Commit to puke coo with a beam sword. Well, thank you for the 500 bits Gooberry juice drew crew approved. We can't have to
[22600.07s -> 22603.67s]  Fight in communities. They can't be Drew crew versus everybody else
[22604.47s -> 22616.27s]  The Drew crew didn't even hate this. Yes, they were. Yes, they can be there will be
[22617.07s -> 22622.61s]  Drew crew versus team Travis
[22623.21s -> 22631.95s]  Wow, never thought I'd see the day that the community would be so split now
[22632.71s -> 22640.05s]  Thank You Gooberry appreciate it though, it's boo. Thanks for the 400 bits boo
[22640.89s -> 22645.74s]  Just want to say I remember you mentioned hash house as your favorite place for a sit-down burger

[22653.62s -> 22658.11s]  It's the best burger I've ever had
[22658.71s -> 22661.28s]  hash house ago go
[22661.28s -> 22668.53s]  At the link. It's it's just one of the best burgers ever

[22700.65s -> 22704.05s]  the blue cheese stuffed burger, please
[22704.97s -> 22707.33s]  The blue cheeseburger and he looked at me he goes
[22708.65s -> 22713.91s]  We don't have any more but we ran out of meat like we don't have any meat that it's all gone
[22713.91s -> 22715.75s]  Because they when it's gone, it's gone
[22715.75s -> 22721.82s]  They had that their meat is fucking phenomenal and they ran out and they were like we don't have any more
[22721.82s -> 22725.86s]  Sorry, like we'll have some probably the next couple days Dave tomorrow the next day. I'm like god damn it

[22780.26s -> 22783.48s]  I think that's just like it's just no, I don't celebrate either one of those

[22891.70s -> 22894.58s]  I really enjoyed fanboying with you over how good the game is
[22894.98s -> 22903.38s]  Particularly since you seem like you were generally having fun with it. I would probably want to make a custom scenario if I ever did
[22903.38s -> 22904.18s]  it again
[22904.18s -> 22908.55s]  it'd be nice to do that and actually make a an
[22910.12s -> 22914.56s]  Adventure that happens that is played out on stream. That'd be more fun. I think
[22915.28s -> 22925.85s]  But yeah, I mean I'm terrible at that game, but I do love it miss Lily T
[22925.85s -> 22931.01s]  Thanks for the 255 two dollars and 55 cents. It's good to see you playing games that you enjoy. I
