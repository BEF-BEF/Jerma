[0.31s -> 14.73s]  Hey, what's up everybody? We are doing some Left 4 Dead here with the group from Method Gaming.
[14.73s -> 18.73s]  We've got of course Burger Boy here, even though he's not in Method.
[18.73s -> 23.73s]  But we've got Roxy, Boo, and Stealth in the call, so introduce yourselves, people.
[23.73s -> 25.73s]  Hey, baby.
[25.73s -> 27.97s]  Hello.
[27.97s -> 29.97s]  Stealth, what about you? You're like in this game right now.
[29.97s -> 31.97s]  I'm like watching American Horror Story right now.
[31.97s -> 33.97s]  I mean, I'm playing Left 4 Dead.
[33.97s -> 35.97s]  Why did I just do that?
[35.97s -> 40.40s]  It's like go kill zombies. I'm like in the game with you guys.
[40.40s -> 46.40s]  Oh, I have a question. When I pound someone with a hunter and I'm clawing away, how do I do more damage with my claws?
[46.40s -> 48.40s]  It just does it automatically.
[48.40s -> 52.40s]  Oh, I thought you could tap a button and it would do it more vigorously.
[52.40s -> 57.40s]  Yeah, you gotta hold L and R and you have to tap A as fast as you can.
[57.40s -> 60.40s]  That's how you capture the Pokemon faster.
[60.40s -> 62.40s]  Did you say hold L and R?
[62.40s -> 63.40s]  Yeah.
[63.40s -> 65.40s]  This is on the PC there, buddy.
[65.40s -> 67.40s]  Oh yeah, forgot.
[67.40s -> 71.40s]  Alright, let's make a little bit of a plan here.
[71.40s -> 73.40s]  So Burger Boy's going that way.
[73.40s -> 75.40s]  Don't let Burger Boy get out around the corner.
[75.40s -> 77.40s]  That's the main plan.
[77.40s -> 81.44s]  I'm gonna go like this way.
[81.44s -> 83.44s]  Stealth, what are you doing?
[83.44s -> 85.44s]  I'm like sneaking up on these guys. They don't even know.
[85.44s -> 88.44s]  What are you guys spawning in as right now? What are you, Roxy?
[88.44s -> 90.44s]  I'm a hunter.
[90.44s -> 92.44s]  Because they're like trashing us right now.
[92.44s -> 96.44s]  I am in the worst of ways. I am a boomer stuck behind a fence. This is a disaster.
[96.44s -> 99.44s]  Oh, if you can boom one of them, try and boom somebody.
[99.44s -> 101.44s]  Because I'll be able to launch on somebody right now.
[101.44s -> 102.44s]  I'm too close.
[102.44s -> 103.44s]  Oh, I missed.
[103.44s -> 106.44s]  Oh, come on. Boom somebody. I'm waiting for the opportunity to do it.
[106.44s -> 107.44s]  Did you get someone?
[107.44s -> 109.44s]  I'm gonna get Burger Boy.
[109.44s -> 110.44s]  Oh, shit.
[110.44s -> 112.44s]  Oh, sugar.
[112.44s -> 114.68s]  Well, I just got pasted.
[114.68s -> 117.68s]  Oh, really? So it's just me?
[117.68s -> 118.98s]  Good luck, Jerma.
[118.98s -> 122.98s]  Oh, what do you know about that one right there?
[122.98s -> 124.98s]  That was a sick pounce.
[124.98s -> 127.98s]  That was a sick pounce. That was really cool.
[127.98s -> 131.98s]  There's an old man. Let's get him. Get Grandpa.
[131.98s -> 135.98s]  What the? Get away from me.
[135.98s -> 140.63s]  Alright, they're gonna win.
[140.63s -> 143.64s]  Hold on, let's see.
[143.64s -> 147.64s]  I'm gonna wait for one of you guys to spawn. I'm not gonna just jump in there.
[147.64s -> 152.94s]  Why do I have the worst feeling that this man's ping is gonna be better than mine soon?
[152.94s -> 155.18s]  Let's go. Why the fuck not?
[155.18s -> 157.80s]  What? What?
[157.80s -> 160.80s]  Oh, damn it. That's right. I have to climb up this. Okay, I get it.
[160.80s -> 161.80s]  Inconceivable.
[161.80s -> 163.98s]  Inconceivable.
[163.98s -> 166.98s]  Oh, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Charge, charge, charge.
[166.98s -> 167.98s]  I'm a spitter.
[167.98s -> 169.22s]  There we go.
[169.22s -> 171.46s]  I'm lost.
[171.46s -> 173.46s]  Oh, damn it. Yeah, I got him. I got him. Nice.
[173.46s -> 175.46s]  How do I crack the hunter?
[175.46s -> 178.46s]  Control? I don't know. F? Maybe H?
[178.46s -> 181.46s]  Fucking PC is the shit out of me.
[181.46s -> 183.46s]  I'm so used to Xbox.
[183.46s -> 187.46s]  Oh my god, that was such a... Oh my god.
[187.46s -> 189.46s]  I'm just watching you.
[189.46s -> 192.76s]  Roxy, I'm just watching you just launch around.
[192.76s -> 194.76s]  Hardcore parkour.
[194.76s -> 197.94s]  Did they get like 50% of the way yet? What's the deal here?
[197.94s -> 201.94s]  He's healing. Just bitch slap him. He's about to go down.
[201.94s -> 203.94s]  Alright, this guy's going on his own.
[203.94s -> 205.94s]  Oh, he's healing. He's healing.
[205.94s -> 208.94s]  I'm going to get this guy right over here when he jumps over here.
[208.94s -> 211.12s]  Francis is healing a pup.
[211.12s -> 214.12s]  I think I'll be right back. I'm going to go watch a TV show.
[216.12s -> 219.48s]  Dude, you can't leave. You're still in the game.
[219.48s -> 221.48s]  Oh yeah, I'm playing.
[221.48s -> 222.48s]  This is bad.
[222.48s -> 225.72s]  I'm on Bill right now.
[225.72s -> 227.72s]  This guy knows I'm right here too.
[227.72s -> 229.72s]  Yeah, this guy knows what he's doing.
[229.72s -> 232.16s]  Come here.
[232.16s -> 234.16s]  There we go. There you go. Good, good, good.
[235.16s -> 237.16s]  Oh, look at that teamwork.
[237.16s -> 240.16s]  That's exactly what we wanted to do right there. Perfect.
[240.16s -> 242.16s]  Anybody in capped?
[242.16s -> 244.16s]  Zoe's about to.
[244.16s -> 247.10s]  She's a bitch slap away.
[247.10s -> 249.10s]  Oh, I got Burger Boy.
[249.10s -> 252.10s]  And all his teammates are nowhere to be found.
[252.10s -> 253.10s]  Try to get the next guy.
[253.10s -> 255.10s]  Sick.
[255.10s -> 257.60s]  Try and grab somebody.
[257.60s -> 259.60s]  There you go. There you go. There you go.
[259.60s -> 262.60s]  Come on, spawn in, Bufu. Get a spit big. Get a spit over there.
[262.60s -> 263.60s]  Nice.
[263.60s -> 265.60s]  Francis is chasing the hell out of you.
[265.60s -> 269.09s]  He's dying in the spit.
[269.09s -> 271.09s]  We're coming back here now.
[271.09s -> 273.09s]  We got him in cap.
[273.09s -> 275.09s]  I thought he was team killing him.
[275.09s -> 277.09s]  Rigatone is going to do something epic right here.
[277.09s -> 280.09s]  They don't have any more health packs. They're all out.
[280.09s -> 281.09s]  That's good. No.
[281.09s -> 284.09s]  Oh, look at that leg.
[284.09s -> 287.23s]  What are you guys spawning in as right now?
[287.23s -> 289.23s]  Boomer.
[289.23s -> 290.23s]  I'm a hunter.
[290.23s -> 293.23s]  Try and get a boom on somebody, and then in the chaos, I will try and...
[293.23s -> 297.72s]  These two are going to die.
[297.72s -> 300.72s]  If somebody can just hit them with something.
[300.72s -> 303.67s]  Burger Boy is dead.
[303.67s -> 304.67s]  Oh, here's a witch.
[304.67s -> 307.67s]  If you can pull them into the witch, I can grow up on them.
[307.67s -> 309.67s]  Oh, I don't know where the witch is.
[309.67s -> 312.04s]  The witch is right here in the middle.
[312.04s -> 313.04s]  Oh, you mad?
[313.04s -> 314.04s]  Ah, got him.
[314.04s -> 315.04s]  Come on, in cap.
[315.04s -> 317.11s]  Damn it.
[317.11s -> 318.11s]  Oh, they started the witch?
[318.11s -> 321.11s]  Yep. I get a boom on it and push them right into her.
[321.11s -> 323.11s]  Oh, she's an angry lady.
[323.11s -> 324.11s]  There you go.
[324.11s -> 325.11s]  There you go.
[325.11s -> 326.11s]  TK, TK.
[326.11s -> 328.48s]  Do not let them beat us.
[328.48s -> 330.65s]  We can't let them win.
[330.65s -> 331.65s]  Just do anything.
[331.65s -> 332.65s]  Hey, baby.
[332.65s -> 333.65s]  Good, good.
[333.65s -> 334.65s]  What?
[334.65s -> 336.65s]  I think I hit one of them, guys.
[336.65s -> 337.65s]  Oh, if I get this guy, it's all a good game.
[337.65s -> 338.65s]  Oh, gimme.
[338.65s -> 341.21s]  Oh, I got him. It's over.
[341.21s -> 342.21s]  Oh, nice splits.
[342.21s -> 343.21s]  Oh, come on.
[343.21s -> 344.21s]  Damn it. No.
[344.21s -> 345.21s]  Oh, times 24.
[345.21s -> 347.21s]  I thought they were all down.
[347.21s -> 348.21s]  Oh, crap.
[348.21s -> 351.52s]  Oh, he has a medkit. Cheeky bastard.
[351.52s -> 355.52s]  All right, well, if they complete this, we're going to do it faster than them.
[355.52s -> 357.52s]  Oh, he's going to throw me on fire.
[357.52s -> 358.52s]  Oh, shit.
[358.52s -> 364.55s]  Wait, that's you just on fire running over here?
[364.55s -> 367.55s]  I figured I'd try and do something.
[367.55s -> 368.55s]  Did they get in?
[368.55s -> 370.55s]  This isn't the safe room, though.
[370.55s -> 371.55s]  Nope.
[371.55s -> 372.55s]  No, they got around the corner.
[372.55s -> 375.55s]  As soon as they jump down, there's the safe room.
[375.55s -> 376.55s]  All right, well, all right, boo.
[376.55s -> 377.55s]  You got to go for a boom.
[377.55s -> 378.55s]  I'm going to try and catch somebody with this.
[378.55s -> 382.56s]  Can you spawn inside still or is that glitched out?
[382.56s -> 383.56s]  I don't know.
[383.56s -> 384.56s]  To be honest, I don't know.
[384.56s -> 387.84s]  Just waiting for somebody to drop.
[387.84s -> 388.84s]  I got this guy.
[389.84s -> 390.84s]  I got a smoker.
[390.84s -> 392.84s]  Yeah, I got a guy in cap right now.
[392.84s -> 393.84s]  Wait, is he dead?
[393.84s -> 394.84s]  Is he hit?
[394.84s -> 395.84s]  Oh, no, he's on the ground still.
[395.84s -> 396.84s]  I got her.
[396.84s -> 397.84s]  There you go.
[397.84s -> 398.84s]  There you go.
[398.84s -> 399.84s]  Nice.
[399.84s -> 400.84s]  I'm good.
[400.84s -> 401.84s]  There's the vomit on a couple of them.
[401.84s -> 403.34s]  All right, come on.
[403.34s -> 404.34s]  Somebody just get in there.
[404.34s -> 406.60s]  Yes.
[406.60s -> 407.60s]  Oh, that's a nasty piece of work.
[407.60s -> 408.60s]  That's the safe room right there.
[408.60s -> 409.60s]  They made it.
[409.60s -> 410.60s]  Just hopefully.
[410.60s -> 412.60s]  Oh, can we just like totally screw them right now?
[412.60s -> 413.60s]  Just take them all out.
[413.60s -> 414.60s]  I'm still dead.
[414.60s -> 415.60s]  I have fit.
[415.60s -> 416.60s]  I love Lewis's scream.
[417.60s -> 419.60s]  Look at burden boy.
[419.60s -> 420.60s]  No.
[420.60s -> 421.60s]  Yeah, they got it.
[421.60s -> 422.97s]  They beat it.
[422.97s -> 423.97s]  All right, well.
[423.97s -> 425.97s]  Get ditched, Lewis.
[426.97s -> 427.97s]  There's no zombies around.
[427.97s -> 428.97s]  They just left.
[428.97s -> 429.97s]  Oh, well.
[430.97s -> 432.66s]  How long do they beat it in?
[434.16s -> 435.52s]  I don't know.
[435.52s -> 436.70s]  I don't think it's...
[436.70s -> 437.70s]  I'm not sure.
[438.70s -> 440.26s]  All right, we're going to do better.
