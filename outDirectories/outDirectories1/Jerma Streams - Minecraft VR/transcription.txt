[0.89s -> 19.10s]  Hi. Wait, what was that? Am I drowning in the game? No, I'm not. Wait, am I dead? How did I die?
[19.10s -> 27.35s]  Oh, I drowned. All right, well, that's all right. I didn't have anything. I just turned it on. I was
[27.35s -> 39.40s]  just testing it. Get the intro back on. I'm not here. You don't see me yet. I'll be right back.
[70.31s -> 82.34s]  Okay. Hello, everybody. I'm back. Another day. Another stream. Today, but the surprise is ruined,
[82.34s -> 89.69s]  even though if you were there last night, you knew. We're gonna play VR. Back in it again.
[91.99s -> 101.21s]  We're gonna start with Minecraft VR. That actually hurt to say that. It's already set up.
[101.93s -> 107.61s]  Apparently, I didn't know this before setting it all up. Look at my outfit today. I'm super
[107.61s -> 117.56s]  springy today. I'm like really summery today. Look at this. I got my fucking beach outfit on.
[117.56s -> 131.24s]  Don't you think? Like these? I do. I got that wave. I got a haircut too. What do you think?
[131.24s -> 138.34s]  Didn't get styled. I shaved. I was ready for you guys tonight. I was ready to do VR.
[140.15s -> 149.72s]  The wave? What's this called? This called something. The wave shirt. No, no, no. What's
[150.12s -> 166.20s]  the shirt called? I look like Ric Flair. I'll take it. I'll fucking take it. I'm pumped up today.
[168.58s -> 176.57s]  Not even at all, actually. I'm kind of tired. But let's go. I'm just wasting time.
[177.29s -> 182.41s]  Hope you all had a good day today. After today, you're not gonna see me for a few days.
[185.80s -> 191.02s]  So I figured I might as well do some Minecraft VR. Is this the right hand?
[191.02s -> 201.88s]  Before I strap these up, let me. Also, by the way, boring. What's it got in the wine glass?
[201.88s -> 212.70s]  Water? Boring. I can't drink in there. I'll fucking die. All right, let's go.
[214.22s -> 220.02s]  I'm gonna get this over with. Somebody has given like 20 community subs with the name
[220.02s -> 225.80s]  Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. You have to change your name now. This is the stream
[225.80s -> 231.61s]  where you change your name. You all thought I was a liar. You thought I wasn't gonna do it.
[232.01s -> 240.97s]  Here we are. I don't really know how to play in VR, though. So it should be, uh,
[242.12s -> 247.91s]  it should be interesting for all of us. This is all untangled. We're all good to go.
[248.47s -> 252.33s]  Did you see my fucking summer outfit? I didn't even get any compliments.
[254.39s -> 261.19s]  We're already tangled. No, we're not. Yeah, that's fine. All right, going in.
[265.86s -> 276.62s]  This shirt probably has sweat stains. It's worn to bed quite frequently. I'm gonna
[276.62s -> 287.16s]  unmute the game too. Don't worry. All right, there we go. So we are in Minecraft now.
[295.64s -> 299.40s]  So what was it? One hour, right? I said I'm gonna play this for one hour
[300.36s -> 303.16s]  and then uninstall the game. I told her I was gonna just dig down until I find
[303.16s -> 312.41s]  diamonds and I'm uninstalling again. Which one is right? Which one's left?
[312.97s -> 324.58s]  This is kind of cool. He went, he came under water to do this?
[326.86s -> 334.09s]  Okay. This is actually really interesting. I don't want the full experience. Not yet.
[334.09s -> 339.67s]  What happened down there? All right, this is the right hand.
[341.00s -> 345.59s]  Because I had to, because the left hand has HUD info on it. See this? There you guys are.
[346.82s -> 352.49s]  Because there's no HUD info. I know this is the right hand. You're gonna drown? I'm already
[352.49s -> 360.57s]  dead. I already died. It's weird seeing the game like this though. This is kind of strange.
[361.37s -> 371.45s]  The blocks look huge. Destroy the tree. Hold on. So we're gonna have to get
[371.45s -> 375.85s]  the whole tutorial here. I know how to play Minecraft, but it's been
[375.85s -> 378.25s]  fucking, and the last time I played it doesn't count because I was shit faced.
[378.97s -> 400.30s]  All right, here we go. So how do I respawn? How do I spawn? Did I get softlocked?
[401.26s -> 415.40s]  Oh, the game window might not be in focus. It's, wow, you're right, it's not. There we go.
[415.40s -> 432.34s]  All right, respawn. Here we go. I hate this already. Okay, so that's inventory. How do I
[432.34s -> 444.04s]  walk? Okay, it's left trigger to walk. It looks like you go towards anywhere you're looking.
[444.84s -> 450.82s]  Destroy the tree. Hold down left button. Okay, how do I get this tutorial out of here? I know
[450.82s -> 454.30s]  what I'm doing. Wait, what are you doing? What are you doing when you first start Minecraft?
[457.93s -> 477.38s]  This is, I hate this. I feel like I'm tuning a TV. Whoa, all right. So you automatically
[477.38s -> 488.62s]  just go up. All right, sick. Let's go. How far is the breach? All right, I gotta stop fucking around.
[491.10s -> 496.38s]  Wood, right? Okay, I got this. How do I place blocks? Okay, it's this button here.
[496.94s -> 502.46s]  Then you can take them away by hitting them again. All right, so say the lines. Not until
[502.46s -> 509.24s]  I know what I'm doing. Plus that wasn't part of the deal. Oh, destroy the tree. I know.
[509.88s -> 521.14s]  This takes too long. All right, where's my inventory? Right over here. All right, so you
[521.14s -> 532.38s]  can slide. No, they're actually not bad controls. So take the whole tree down.
[533.02s -> 540.38s]  How do you make torches? It's light and charcoal, right? How do you, what is it? It's,
[541.58s -> 547.82s]  how do you make a torch? It's charcoal and wood stove? All right, I got enough wood.
[548.46s -> 572.34s]  Light, yes, yes. Just harvest some light. Press E. What's E? Well, that's how you,
[572.34s -> 581.53s]  that's how you throw. No, that's, that's a menu. What is E? Top left button? Yeah,
[581.53s -> 594.10s]  that's what I just pressed. One of the grips, maybe? What is E? Just press E. I can't just,
[594.10s -> 616.04s]  there's no E on my hand. Where'd that go? Press E. Didn't I just do it? Ah, okay,
[616.04s -> 620.44s]  wait, wait, wait. Okay, so hold on here. It's up. You have to press up. What's down?
[620.44s -> 625.83s]  Let's just get the buttons ready. Down is jump. What is right? Okay, everything, it's,
[625.83s -> 633.72s]  okay, I got it. I got E. There's the crafting menu. So this is your click to open key showing off.
[634.84s -> 637.40s]  And this is, I make, oh, well, this is a lot different than what I remember.
[640.54s -> 651.46s]  Then, okay, so you just put it up here and then take them. He got it. Okay, then you do
[652.34s -> 661.66s]  sticks and then I need to make a tool, right? That's enough tools. So crafting,
[661.66s -> 668.90s]  I need to make a workbench. That's this, right? How do I split them? How do you split?
[668.90s -> 679.77s]  There it is. Crafting bench. All right. And then let me just make a little shitty fucking
[679.77s -> 684.98s]  house first. Just hold on. Get out of the menu. I got to make a house. Right on the
[684.98s -> 705.70s]  beach. Perfect. What do you think? Hell yeah. I'm so ready for a 24-hour stream here. It's
[705.70s -> 714.97s]  not going to be 24 hours. Good thing you have your beach outfit on. Yeah. All right,
[714.97s -> 721.34s]  so I'm thinking a long dock here and then the house. I don't want to, no, actually live
[721.34s -> 727.00s]  on a beach is fine. I need a shovel. This is very overwhelming. So just put the fucking
[727.00s -> 734.95s]  crafting bench down. Who cares? Not like that. Go get it. So crafting bench, just put it over
[734.95s -> 744.79s]  there. I'll open it up. So does this count that I'm like standing near it? Okay, there
[744.79s -> 752.52s]  it is. Let's get it all in there. I got pickaxe. Let's get a, wow. Does it actually
[752.60s -> 759.19s]  work? Does this work? That's actually really cool. I don't know if you can actually hit
[759.19s -> 770.20s]  stuff with this. Okay, shovel. That's important. All right, now let's go get what we need.
[770.20s -> 772.92s]  Forget about all the, I don't know, I'm not going to do any of this shit. I'll be
[772.92s -> 775.88s]  lucky if I play this for more than 30 minutes. Well, it was supposed to be an
[775.88s -> 800.97s]  hour, but you get it. You understand. You can hit. No shit. No fucking way. That's
[800.97s -> 814.87s]  too much for anybody's brain. No, I was going to do it like this. That's too much.
[814.95s -> 823.74s]  I don't want to do it like that. Let's get this place cleaned up. I don't need that
[823.74s -> 827.90s]  big of a house. I do have to, I gotta go down. Uh, there's a basement right here
[827.90s -> 839.14s]  with this water. Uh, this way. Let's go over here. There's stone. All right, my
[839.14s -> 859.34s]  house is over there. Is water gonna get in here? I need, I need coal. Check
[859.34s -> 865.42s]  your recipe book. I know. What about over here? Where the fuck am I? I don't
[865.42s -> 871.22s]  want to be on this waterfront. I need to get coal. I'm just going to go straight
[871.22s -> 887.75s]  down here. I will say this is probably the the coolest way you could play
[887.75s -> 902.95s]  Minecraft. All right, you see coal? It's getting dark out. I need coal right
[902.95s -> 916.36s]  now. Okay, you can burn wood too, can't you? Stone axe. I know. I don't have a
[916.36s -> 929.69s]  weapon. How long is the day night cycle? I'm actually fucking getting scared
[929.69s -> 952.89s]  though. This actually is scary. There's a creeper over there. All right,
[952.97s -> 957.94s]  I gotta go burn wood. Is that what you, I gotta burn wood, right? Where's my
[957.94s -> 979.91s]  house? Over here. Okay, at night this is a much different game. Who cares if I
[979.91s -> 986.73s]  die? There we go, right here. I need to make a, uh, furnace, right? But this is
[986.73s -> 993.22s]  gonna be the house. Might as well. Is that a creeper face right there?
[993.22s -> 997.35s]  That's a creeper just staring at me, right? It's coming at once. That's
[997.35s -> 1007.50s]  a, that's a wart creeper. Must have been added in the fucking 1.2 update.
[1007.50s -> 1017.99s]  All right, let's see here. I need, that's not a furnace? That's not a
[1017.99s -> 1033.61s]  furnace. How is that not a furnace? It's eight in a, isn't this a crafting
[1033.61s -> 1040.46s]  bench though? Am I, is something, what's going on here? Am I in the crafting
[1040.46s -> 1070.06s]  menu? This is the crafting table, isn't it? That's not the, I haven't
[1070.06s -> 1073.50s]  played Minecraft, actually for real, without being drunk in like four years.
[1077.22s -> 1082.79s]  It's the crafting table. Isn't, that's not what this is. This is not a
[1082.79s -> 1113.19s]  crafting table. I just was trying to open this. What the fuck? Is that,
[1113.19s -> 1121.06s]  is this gravel? God damn it. Just give it back. Give it, just, just get
[1121.06s -> 1127.13s]  it, just, just get out. It's kind of awkward, the commerce, the, the,
[1127.13s -> 1134.47s]  it's kind of awkward menus. All right, so, put this down. This is,
[1134.47s -> 1141.06s]  don't take it either. All right, move over here. So, I gotta put some
[1141.06s -> 1149.98s]  wood in here. Does that count? No. Charcoal, I can't just put, like,
[1150.30s -> 1153.58s]  I can't put like a tree in there. It's gotta be like a block of wood,
[1153.58s -> 1161.74s]  right? No, I don't even have an axe. I need a regular fucking bench,
[1161.74s -> 1165.40s]  like a storage unit or something. There's something fucking here.
[1168.94s -> 1174.62s]  So, left button is, it's up here, it's odd, because every other place
[1174.62s -> 1190.97s]  you press is jump. This is place. It's hard to see. It's like a
[1190.97s -> 1193.77s]  tint, it's like hard to see it from here. Remember, I'm working with
[1193.77s -> 1203.16s]  like half the resolution that you guys are seeing. Let's just start
[1203.16s -> 1210.28s]  making a fucking house. All right, here we go. Whatever the fucking,
[1211.00s -> 1214.84s]  that's way too many creepers. That's a joke. I'm getting stream sniped
[1214.84s -> 1218.31s]  by like seven creepers over here. You knew I was going to be
[1218.31s -> 1228.15s]  streaming over here. Are you fucking serious? There was at least
[1228.15s -> 1243.96s]  five or six right there. No joke. All right, let's go. How do I
[1243.96s -> 1250.81s]  sneak? Not like that. I don't give a shit. I can fix it later.
[1253.96s -> 1256.60s]  Uh, the ceilings are way too high. I don't know how to sneak
[1256.60s -> 1259.80s]  like on this controller. You don't know how to sneak? You're
[1259.80s -> 1268.06s]  just crouching in real life. That's a lie. That's not how you
[1268.06s -> 1274.47s]  do it. Close your closet. I can't do that right now.
[1275.43s -> 1292.23s]  Let's just, I gotta go over here. Everybody starts with a
[1292.23s -> 1304.63s]  dirt house for shelter. I gotta come out here a little.
[1304.63s -> 1320.14s]  I'm close to something. What are you doing? One more? Look at
[1320.14s -> 1334.02s]  that. Okay, now. What am I near? Only non-pro gamers use
[1334.02s -> 1344.84s]  dirt. The desk is over here. That's a new monster. How do I
[1344.84s -> 1363.56s]  take care of this monster? Why is he faster in water?
[1364.20s -> 1373.58s]  Monster hunter. All right, get the fuck out of here. Hurry
[1373.58s -> 1381.70s]  up. Climb back up. Sun's coming up. The monsters are
[1381.70s -> 1385.78s]  huge. I guess you are just the same size, right? All
[1385.78s -> 1389.48s]  right, where was I? I gotta find something to light the
[1389.48s -> 1408.78s]  house with. Alright, that's fine. I just need a wall over
[1408.78s -> 1412.22s]  here. Anybody know how to sneak? Turn on the music.
[1412.22s -> 1419.13s]  Music is on. Change your scale above 100%. I actually
[1419.13s -> 1429.26s]  like it like this though. Alright, there we go. That's
[1429.26s -> 1433.78s]  all I need then. Just this way. And this is it. Then
[1433.78s -> 1440.58s]  I'm gonna build the roof. I got two. I think it's
[1440.58s -> 1454.54s]  coming along alright. That looks fine. This is just a
[1454.54s -> 1458.46s]  placeholder until like, okay, I gotta go on a search. I
[1458.46s -> 1461.90s]  gotta go on an adventure for diamonds. Not diamonds, fuck.
[1461.90s -> 1472.06s]  Stone. Home sweet home. Hello ladies and gentlemen,
[1472.06s -> 1476.86s]  welcome to episode one of Turbocraft, the series where
[1476.86s -> 1480.38s]  I play Minecraft. And if you can get yourself into a
[1480.38s -> 1483.50s]  nice seated comfortable position, hands inside the ride
[1483.50s -> 1486.06s]  at all times, we're gonna make our way over down
[1486.06s -> 1488.54s]  there. I think that way. Maybe there's some diamonds
[1488.54s -> 1493.26s]  over there. I got myself a I got a cider. I hope you got
[1493.26s -> 1498.70s]  one too. That's good. And there you go. There's there's
[1498.70s -> 1503.93s]  the clip that I will see posted to my channel 5000
[1503.93s -> 1510.63s]  times a week until the day I'm dead. At my funeral,
[1510.63s -> 1513.59s]  one of you guys is gonna show up and fucking put
[1513.59s -> 1524.60s]  that on like a tablet and place it on the casket. We
[1524.60s -> 1528.68s]  need a comparison. Alright, first of all, lambs. I'll
[1528.68s -> 1547.70s]  take one. I was just fucking fell over. I need that.
[1547.70s -> 1550.87s]  Alright, I got the meat. Am I not supposed to be doing
[1550.87s -> 1576.63s]  this? Get this fucking break it with your hands. No,
[1576.63s -> 1580.10s]  kids are gonna love this. I'm serious. Kids are gonna
[1580.10s -> 1587.54s]  love this. I didn't kids play this yet. Alright, what
[1587.54s -> 1590.92s]  was I doing? Okay, I got wool. I can make a bed now.
[1590.92s -> 1595.62s]  Now, I just need three pieces of wood. How about this
[1595.62s -> 1608.06s]  one? Looks good to me. This is a different kind of
[1608.06s -> 1621.22s]  wood though, right? Okay. Now, bring that to the
[1621.22s -> 1631.93s]  crafting bench. Make a bed. There it is. This is my
[1631.93s -> 1640.87s]  house. You can always tell cuz it's a wall of
[1640.87s -> 1647.99s]  dirt. Holy shit. I'm not gonna read that one. The
[1647.99s -> 1653.13s]  house is ruined. It hasn't even started yet. Oh,
[1653.13s -> 1654.89s]  that makes me wanna throw up a little bit. I'm not
[1654.89s -> 1660.86s]  gonna lie. Okay, now, I need I need an axe. I need
[1660.86s -> 1664.14s]  no. God, it's it's so it's so much going on in my
[1664.14s -> 1671.51s]  brain. Open this up with this menu. Okay, so I
[1671.51s -> 1675.67s]  need to make this shit. I'll take it. All of it,
[1675.67s -> 1683.21s]  please and it's 123 and then bang. Got yourself a
[1683.21s -> 1688.44s]  fucking bed. Perfect. So, now, when I die, I
[1688.44s -> 1695.02s]  will spawn here. That's not how I don't think
[1695.02s -> 1697.18s]  that's not how you place it, right? You have to
[1697.18s -> 1703.58s]  which way do I want the bed? Who cares? That's
[1704.14s -> 1714.68s]  your entrance right here. The door. Okay, there's
[1714.68s -> 1717.62s]  the door will come in here. Put a staircase
[1717.62s -> 1721.38s]  there. What do you guys think? The bed is near
[1721.38s -> 1723.86s]  your spawn point. What do you mean? That is the
[1723.86s -> 1731.90s]  spawn point. Alright, and let's just get some,
[1731.90s -> 1733.90s]  I need some, do I have enough wood for it,
[1733.90s -> 1737.02s]  right? I need to jump. Jumping is a little
[1737.02s -> 1749.93s]  weird. Let's go with, no, that's sand. How do
[1749.93s -> 1753.56s]  you make an axe? Like that or something? How
[1753.56s -> 1755.72s]  does it, how do you make the the chopping
[1755.72s -> 1773.46s]  tree axe? Oh, okay, like that. I need a box.
[1773.46s -> 1780.57s]  How do you make a box? It's like this, right?
[1780.57s -> 1787.70s]  Yeah, put that here. Alright, get out of
[1787.70s -> 1794.20s]  this menu. Get out of the menu. So, now,
[1794.20s -> 1796.12s]  let's put this here. I just need to put a
[1796.12s -> 1798.52s]  bunch of dumb shit in here. Um, I don't
[1798.52s -> 1800.68s]  know. Put like the, can I send it there
[1800.68s -> 1801.96s]  quickly without having to tap like a
[1801.96s -> 1805.72s]  million times? There's got to be a way I
[1805.72s -> 1807.32s]  can like press that and just have it send
[1807.32s -> 1808.60s]  over there, right? Or do I actually have to
[1808.60s -> 1813.26s]  physically do this? Because I have that
[1813.26s -> 1819.42s]  pick throw. There's a button to do it. Just
[1819.42s -> 1822.94s]  try everything. Try everything. Alright,
[1822.94s -> 1827.30s]  that's right. This is left. This is up.
[1827.30s -> 1832.70s]  This is pick up. This is right. Down.
[1832.70s -> 1843.61s]  Left. Button. Nope. Button. Try jumping.
[1843.61s -> 1846.97s]  There you go. You got your clip. You
[1846.97s -> 1848.01s]  might have to send it in the control
[1848.01s -> 1851.18s]  menu. Ah, whatever. Alright, gravel,
[1851.18s -> 1852.62s]  cobblestone. It's not actually that
[1852.62s -> 1855.58s]  big of a deal. It really is not. That
[1855.58s -> 1860.22s]  kind of sucks though. Alright, I got meat.
[1860.22s -> 1861.90s]  Let's get that in here. You die, right,
[1861.90s -> 1865.82s]  if you don't eat.
[1865.82s -> 1868.06s]  Keep the dirt. Keep the sand. Just fucking
[1868.06s -> 1869.42s]  throw this in the trash.
[1869.42s -> 1875.13s]  Uh, these are almost broken. I don't
[1875.13s -> 1876.97s]  know. I need more cobblestone.
[1876.97s -> 1883.66s]  Okay, this is, this is spartar.
[1883.66s -> 1884.86s]  That wasn't me almost puking. That was
[1884.86s -> 1887.66s]  me just burping. Everything's fine.
[1887.66s -> 1898.63s]  Wood. Let's go. I'm just gonna get
[1898.63s -> 1899.67s]  this shit. I'm gonna cut down every
[1899.67s -> 1900.79s]  tree.
[1900.79s -> 1910.60s]  And I'm not gonna replant them. I
[1910.60s -> 1911.64s]  don't want them here. I'm gonna, I'm
[1911.64s -> 1913.56s]  gonna plant all the trees over there.
[1913.56s -> 1925.43s]  Okay, I'm gonna get like maybe 30 or 40.
[1925.43s -> 1941.88s]  Probably 30 to 50 more full trees.
[1941.88s -> 1943.88s]  Can't, Microsoft owns this company now.
[1943.88s -> 1946.28s]  Can't I just pay some money?
[1946.28s -> 1949.16s]  Like 15 bucks to already have leather
[1949.16s -> 1951.30s]  fucking jackets on
[1951.30s -> 1954.34s]  and already have, what is that noise?
[1954.34s -> 1974.68s]  I don't know. Yeah, like where's my
[1974.68s -> 1976.04s]  like 12 dollar? You don't have to
[1976.04s -> 1984.01s]  cut a tree down anymore.
[1984.01s -> 1988.63s]  I'd buy, I'd buy it twice. Times two
[1988.63s -> 1989.67s]  speed.
[1989.67s -> 2005.82s]  Okay, that's good. Did I get them all?
[2005.82s -> 2006.78s]  Wood tools.
[2006.78s -> 2013.27s]  I know, I know. I'm fucking terrible.
[2013.27s -> 2016.39s]  Wood. He's using wood tools.
[2016.39s -> 2025.85s]  What is that? What is this thing? Is
[2025.85s -> 2032.49s]  that a fish?
[2032.49s -> 2034.65s]  This fish in Minecraft? How long ago
[2034.65s -> 2035.93s]  was this put in?
[2035.93s -> 2040.33s]  What happened to that guy? It is a
[2040.33s -> 2041.59s]  fish.
[2041.59s -> 2043.43s]  That's so cool. Can you deserve
[2043.43s -> 2049.18s]  fishing rod? I thought that was an
[2049.18s -> 2050.14s]  error.
[2050.14s -> 2052.54s]  Like a source, a source engine error
[2052.54s -> 2053.82s]  spinning around.
[2053.82s -> 2056.15s]  They come up with a massive ocean
[2056.15s -> 2057.43s]  update, really.
[2057.43s -> 2063.83s]  That's pretty cool. Punch the fish.
[2063.83s -> 2066.55s]  No, not now. That's too busy.
[2066.55s -> 2074.68s]  Maybe in like a little bit, hold on.
[2074.68s -> 2076.84s]  All right, I need,
[2076.84s -> 2079.40s]  I need, I just need stone. Just get me
[2079.40s -> 2080.20s]  stone.
[2080.20s -> 2082.92s]  There's my stone cavity right here.
[2082.92s -> 2100.38s]  Just give me a bunch of it.
[2100.38s -> 2101.58s]  This is gonna break.
[2101.58s -> 2108.09s]  Is that, I need to make it stone
[2108.09s -> 2109.61s]  pickaxe. Just go quick.
[2109.61s -> 2118.95s]  With a bed, you need to be even
[2118.95s -> 2119.99s]  shorter.
[2119.99s -> 2123.05s]  Yeah, I'm too tall to ride that ride.
[2123.05s -> 2124.25s]  I know, right?
[2124.25s -> 2130.07s]  Crazy. Fish? No. All right, let's get this
[2130.07s -> 2131.35s]  going here.
[2131.35s -> 2140.04s]  No, not what there is. I need sticks.
[2140.04s -> 2142.90s]  Fuck.
[2142.90s -> 2145.30s]  I'm safe. Am I safe in the house?
[2145.30s -> 2146.71s]  That's
[2146.71s -> 2149.46s]  a glass of milk. Why does the moon
[2149.46s -> 2152.42s]  look like that?
[2152.42s -> 2158.58s]  Why is the moon a fucking rectangle?
[2158.58s -> 2161.40s]  All right, um, here we go. Just make
[2161.40s -> 2162.84s]  a ton of these.
[2162.84s -> 2167.62s]  Can I do this faster? I guess just by
[2167.62s -> 2168.82s]  tapping it.
[2168.82s -> 2170.26s]  I have, what's the fun to make this
[2170.26s -> 2172.18s]  happen instantly with everything?
[2172.18s -> 2175.82s]  Just, I'm gonna have to go in the
[2175.82s -> 2177.58s]  controls and see what it is.
[2177.58s -> 2182.79s]  Not now though, I'm only gonna week.
[2182.79s -> 2186.23s]  All right, so now let's get some,
[2186.23s -> 2188.07s]  what the hell is that?
[2188.07s -> 2193.67s]  No, I just want, I just want some
[2193.67s -> 2194.79s]  sticks.
[2194.79s -> 2196.86s]  All right, they have to be on top
[2196.86s -> 2197.82s]  of each other.
[2197.82s -> 2208.92s]  20 sticks, that sounds good. All right,
[2208.92s -> 2212.41s]  give me some good tools now. Now I
[2212.41s -> 2212.89s]  can
[2212.89s -> 2214.81s]  break iron, right? Let's make two of
[2214.81s -> 2219.53s]  these.
[2219.53s -> 2220.65s]  No, that's the worst item in the
[2220.65s -> 2221.53s]  game.
[2221.53s -> 2231.13s]  All right, let's make a sword. Gonna need
[2231.13s -> 2232.87s]  that.
[2232.87s -> 2240.94s]  And, all right, looks fine.
[2240.94s -> 2251.45s]  Put the sticks back and throw the,
[2251.45s -> 2252.97s]  actually no, these are extreme backups.
[2252.97s -> 2254.01s]  I need them.
[2254.01s -> 2262.73s]  Cobblestone, put it up here. All right,
[2262.73s -> 2271.67s]  I'm ready. Let's go. Get in the bed.
[2271.67s -> 2279.43s]  No, I'm not, I'm not, I know this,
[2279.43s -> 2281.03s]  the trick here, guys. If I get in
[2281.03s -> 2282.47s]  this bed, they're gonna be standing
[2282.47s -> 2283.11s]  over me.
[2283.11s -> 2284.55s]  They're gonna be hovering over my
[2284.55s -> 2285.67s]  face.
[2285.67s -> 2290.30s]  I have to sleep with my knife out.
[2291.45s -> 2295.59s]  That's, that's old. I thought if you were
[2295.59s -> 2297.35s]  sleeping out in the open, then monsters
[2297.35s -> 2298.79s]  just spawned like in your
[2298.79s -> 2303.27s]  face. No, I know it skips the night,
[2303.27s -> 2306.25s]  but that doesn't happen anymore.
[2306.25s -> 2309.19s]  They patched that out. That was a
[2309.19s -> 2313.13s]  reason why I quit Minecraft.
[2313.13s -> 2319.72s]  War, Warcraft server mod. Why do I
[2319.72s -> 2325.86s]  have a Warcraft mod? What?
[2325.86s -> 2328.66s]  Why do you have Warcraft? I do not
[2328.66s -> 2333.29s]  have that.
[2333.29s -> 2335.05s]  No, that's not it. Let me be very,
[2335.05s -> 2336.65s]  very, very clear. There's not a joke
[2336.65s -> 2337.61s]  reveal there.
[2337.61s -> 2338.73s]  This isn't like, oh, he's just
[2338.73s -> 2340.49s]  pretending to play vanilla fucking
[2340.49s -> 2341.29s]  Minecraft,
[2341.29s -> 2342.49s]  and all of a sudden the sorcerer is
[2342.49s -> 2343.61s]  going to show up, and he's going to
[2343.61s -> 2345.29s]  start casting fucking spells at people.
[2345.29s -> 2347.13s]  No.
[2347.13s -> 2348.49s]  Everyone thinks that's, but that's,
[2348.49s -> 2349.93s]  no. I'm sorry, guys. You're going to be
[2349.93s -> 2351.21s]  really disappointed in like 20
[2351.21s -> 2352.33s]  minutes.
[2352.33s -> 2354.73s]  All right, let's go on an adventure.
[2354.73s -> 2355.93s]  And by adventure, I mean let's just
[2355.93s -> 2358.25s]  go break stuff until I find diamonds,
[2358.25s -> 2360.57s]  and then we're going to stop playing.
[2360.57s -> 2365.30s]  What do you say? I need to leave a
[2365.30s -> 2370.62s]  remember trail here.
[2370.62s -> 2372.78s]  Yeah, I'm like a dog, guys. I need to
[2372.78s -> 2407.80s]  have this.
[2407.80s -> 2410.60s]  Okay, so if I just, just follow the
[2410.60s -> 2411.16s]  fucking
[2411.16s -> 2414.52s]  Hansel and Gretel trail. Here we go.
[2414.52s -> 2419.45s]  Let's go right here. I'm going right
[2419.45s -> 2420.33s]  here.
[2420.33s -> 2432.38s]  Nipro. I didn't get a show.
[2432.38s -> 2433.26s]  Don't matter. I don't even need it.
[2433.26s -> 2433.90s]  Here it is.
[2433.90s -> 2439.35s]  Got it. This is it, right? What is
[2439.35s -> 2440.31s]  this? This is,
[2440.31s -> 2448.18s]  this is that, is that what I need?
[2448.18s -> 2450.10s]  No. It's like little coal pieces,
[2450.10s -> 2450.82s]  right?
[2450.82s -> 2456.65s]  No, this is like the easiest
[2456.65s -> 2458.25s]  resource in the whole game,
[2458.25s -> 2466.57s]  because then I can make torches.
[2466.57s -> 2487.48s]  Oh, I remember this song. What did this,
[2487.48s -> 2489.08s]  what a nostalgia stream this really
[2489.08s -> 2491.08s]  turned out to be.
[2491.08s -> 2498.09s]  Guys, remember, remember when you were
[2498.09s -> 2499.45s]  11
[2499.45s -> 2513.05s]  three years ago? Who are you? Okay, let
[2513.05s -> 2514.49s]  me, like look, look, look, look. Hold
[2514.49s -> 2515.77s]  on.
[2515.77s -> 2518.49s]  I'm 39. Listen, this is, I'm, how
[2518.49s -> 2519.85s]  many viewers in here?
[2519.85s -> 2530.60s]  Like 4k? There's probably at least,
[2530.60s -> 2531.56s]  people probably only are at this
[2531.56s -> 2532.76s]  stream because it's Minecraft, and it's a
[2532.76s -> 2533.64s]  great fucking game.
[2533.64s -> 2537.96s]  I'm gonna stop swearing. I remember
[2537.96s -> 2538.92s]  when I was 11,
[2538.92s -> 2540.60s]  like 10 years ago. Wasn't that long
[2540.60s -> 2546.36s]  ago? Absolutely not.
[2546.36s -> 2549.00s]  Change the FOV. What do you mean the FOV?
[2549.00s -> 2556.95s]  Is the FOV bad? What's wrong with the
[2556.95s -> 2557.99s]  FOV?
[2557.99s -> 2572.23s]  Wait, hold on. You mean like in here?
[2572.23s -> 2579.13s]  Dynamic FOV?
[2579.13s -> 2586.63s]  What, what a fog start, where is it?
[2586.63s -> 2591.86s]  The FOV on the webcam. Why did you
[2591.86s -> 2593.22s]  decide to play Minecraft? Because I
[2593.22s -> 2594.18s]  lost a bet,
[2594.18s -> 2595.38s]  and I'm going to be very salty
[2595.38s -> 2600.33s]  about it. What a messy closet.
[2600.33s -> 2606.07s]  That's just an optical illusion. He's
[2606.07s -> 2607.35s]  answering the FOV prayers.
[2607.35s -> 2610.15s]  Well, is it a, is it a, I don't see it in
[2610.15s -> 2611.27s]  the menu.
[2611.27s -> 2622.94s]  Performance? Chunks? Other?
[2622.94s -> 2625.42s]  Max frame rate? View bobbing off? We use
[2625.42s -> 2627.03s]  bobs?
[2627.03s -> 2629.51s]  Dynamic FOV is not the same. It's not
[2629.51s -> 2635.96s]  in the video settings.
[2635.96s -> 2641.75s]  It's in the actual VR settings.
[2641.75s -> 2647.37s]  Stereo rendering. Stereo rendering?
[2647.37s -> 2649.29s]  Mirror display?
[2649.29s -> 2656.39s]  Hold on, back it up. HUD, head HUD.
[2656.47s -> 2660.90s]  Hide HUD. World scale.
[2660.90s -> 2666.22s]  Locomotion. Controls?
[2666.22s -> 2672.04s]  Let me just see, yeah, this is quick
[2672.04s -> 2679.56s]  commands. Crosshair size.
[2679.56s -> 2685.10s]  Maybe it's scale. Oh, wait, wait, wait,
[2685.10s -> 2688.26s]  hold on.
[2688.26s -> 2692.28s]  Rotation? No. FOV comfort reduction?
[2692.28s -> 2694.36s]  Shrink? Shrinks the field of view while
[2694.36s -> 2696.36s]  moving? Can help? No.
[2696.36s -> 2712.79s]  That's not it. It's under controls.
[2712.79s -> 2715.67s]  Sensitivity. Touchpad mode. Auto jump
[2715.67s -> 2728.18s]  for mouse.
[2728.18s -> 2733.24s]  There is no FOV. You guys are just
[2733.24s -> 2740.12s]  fucking with me.
[2740.12s -> 2744.06s]  Turn down the, it's actually on the
[2744.06s -> 2745.34s]  vibe.
[2745.34s -> 2760.94s]  Turn up the brightness.
[2760.94s -> 2763.18s]  I'm trying to do this nostalgia trip
[2763.18s -> 2764.86s]  for all of us 40 year olds that when
[2764.86s -> 2766.46s]  they were 11, 30 years ago when they
[2766.46s -> 2769.27s]  played this game,
[2769.27s -> 2771.19s]  and what I was going to say, I might
[2771.19s -> 2772.71s]  even talk in the right direction,
[2772.71s -> 2774.71s]  what I was going to say is the
[2774.71s -> 2776.23s]  reason why I said that comment is
[2776.23s -> 2777.43s]  because it's probably people that I
[2777.43s -> 2780.07s]  hear that I love Minecraft and are
[2780.07s -> 2780.79s]  like
[2780.79s -> 2783.27s]  love this shit and they don't watch
[2783.27s -> 2784.55s]  these streams
[2784.55s -> 2788.07s]  so I'm gonna stop saying bad things.
[2788.07s -> 2791.82s]  This is a nice house. I think I'll
[2791.82s -> 2792.86s]  keep this one.
[2792.86s -> 2793.90s]  All right, I'll turn the brightness
[2793.90s -> 2804.25s]  up. I'll at least do you that.
[2804.25s -> 2809.74s]  How do I do that? Dynamic lights?
[2809.74s -> 2815.22s]  Quality shaders? Oh, dog that's my
[2815.22s -> 2816.98s]  entire IP address.
[2816.98s -> 2830.82s]  It's every IP I've ever had. Anybody
[2830.82s -> 2833.35s]  know where this is?
[2833.43s -> 2836.47s]  Am I blind? No, I- okay. Brightness,
[2836.47s -> 2838.12s]  moody.
[2838.12s -> 2840.36s]  I see- I see the- I see moody.
[2840.36s -> 2841.72s]  I don't- that's not a-
[2841.72s -> 2864.39s]  this doesn't even do anything.
[2864.39s -> 2871.70s]  Fucking Minecraft VR. I almost just
[2871.70s -> 2872.98s]  clicked that thinking that you guys
[2872.98s -> 2878.09s]  were going to appear.
[2878.09s -> 2879.29s]  All right, let's go back. I'll put
[2879.29s -> 2882.90s]  brightness up to like plus 20.
[2882.90s -> 2885.38s]  There you go. Now everybody can see.
[2885.38s -> 2886.98s]  Now everybody can have so much fun.
[2886.98s -> 2889.22s]  Oh boy, Minecraft. Remember we did
[2889.22s -> 2891.06s]  that pit cross level that we cheated
[2891.06s -> 2893.06s]  and now he has to play this? That's
[2893.06s -> 2901.51s]  why he's here.
[2901.51s -> 2904.58s]  This actually is- this is really cool.
[2904.58s -> 2907.45s]  Like if- I'm not gonna fuck around.
[2907.45s -> 2912.01s]  This is actually really cool.
[2912.01s -> 2913.37s]  Okay, don't- I'm gonna hurt the fucking
[2913.37s -> 2915.46s]  vibe.
[2915.46s -> 2917.82s]  Here we go. Can I please get back to
[2917.82s -> 2930.92s]  what I was doing now?
[2930.92s -> 2933.72s]  Just give me- ooh, we found ourselves
[2933.72s -> 2936.10s]  a cavern.
[2936.10s -> 2938.10s]  This is what you play for. All right,
[2938.10s -> 2939.86s]  there it is. There it is. There it is.
[2939.86s -> 2941.46s]  There it is. There it is.
[2941.46s -> 2947.90s]  This is gonna kill me. Oh shit, is this-
[2947.90s -> 2951.46s]  will I die from this?
[2951.46s -> 2964.71s]  This is really interesting like this.
[2964.71s -> 2974.20s]  I just get this and then that was a
[2974.20s -> 2975.16s]  big chunk, right?
[2975.16s -> 2979.26s]  Is that it? That's all that was here?
[2979.26s -> 2987.82s]  Oh fuck, look at that. Oh well, I'm
[2987.82s -> 2990.78s]  getting like Warcraft stones.
[2990.78s -> 2992.22s]  Do I actually have a mod of stuff? Why
[2992.22s -> 2994.62s]  am I getting the Warcraft stones?
[2994.62s -> 2995.74s]  That's a mod, right? That's like
[2995.74s -> 2997.59s]  mag- mana?
[2997.59s -> 2999.91s]  It's a joke. It's a- I'm kidding. It's a-
[2999.91s -> 3001.27s]  I'm making that up.
[3001.27s -> 3006.42s]  I know what it is. It's experience
[3006.42s -> 3008.98s]  points.
[3008.98s -> 3010.34s]  Oh, my germ is getting like real
[3010.34s -> 3011.86s]  salty lately.
[3011.86s -> 3013.54s]  What's going on with that?
[3014.06s -> 3016.06s]  I haven't watched the streams in like a
[3016.06s -> 3018.70s]  few weeks. Germa's like really salty.
[3018.70s -> 3033.58s]  What was that? Okay. Oh, where?
[3033.58s -> 3042.95s]  Holy shit, that's so much worse in VR.
[3042.95s -> 3043.91s]  Jesus.
[3043.91s -> 3047.35s]  I got his gallbladder. Okay, I need to
[3047.35s -> 3048.23s]  make-
[3048.23s -> 3067.13s]  I'm gonna make some torches here.
[3067.13s -> 3070.46s]  Finally, I have light. All right, close
[3070.46s -> 3072.30s]  this up.
[3072.30s -> 3075.58s]  Wow. Oh, turn the brightness up,
[3075.58s -> 3077.77s]  Jeremy.
[3077.77s -> 3081.45s]  I can't see, Jeremy. He's looking
[3081.45s -> 3090.33s]  real salty, ain't he, Jeremy?
[3090.33s -> 3095.27s]  Human fingers. I know it's here. I see
[3095.27s -> 3095.75s]  it.
[3095.75s -> 3131.34s]  Is that it? Do you think they'll be
[3131.34s -> 3133.10s]  talking about Minecraft?
[3133.10s -> 3134.94s]  That's not a real wall. Uh, do you
[3134.94s -> 3135.74s]  think they'll be talking about
[3135.74s -> 3137.26s]  Minecraft as like one of the greatest
[3137.26s -> 3138.46s]  human inventions
[3138.46s -> 3140.86s]  in like a hundred years or something?
[3140.86s -> 3144.50s]  Do you think like kids,
[3144.50s -> 3145.62s]  like a hundred years from now, this
[3145.62s -> 3147.59s]  will be in a textbook?
[3147.59s -> 3150.94s]  I think it will be. I really do. I
[3150.94s -> 3151.90s]  really think they'll be talking about
[3151.90s -> 3153.26s]  this. Like, there'll be the,
[3153.26s -> 3155.10s]  you know, the invention of the water
[3155.10s -> 3157.98s]  fountain wheel
[3157.98s -> 3161.10s]  and then like the washing machine
[3161.10s -> 3168.54s]  Minecraft. They'll all be in a row.
[3168.54s -> 3169.90s]  This goes really- all right, there's a
[3169.90s -> 3171.34s]  creeper down there.
[3171.34s -> 3172.38s]  Is that- no, that's not a creeper.
[3172.38s -> 3179.48s]  What the hell is that? Is that one-
[3179.48s -> 3180.60s]  that's one of those bow skeletons,
[3180.60s -> 3181.40s]  right?
[3181.40s -> 3201.19s]  I can't reach them mice. What the
[3201.19s -> 3203.72s]  fuck is that?
[3203.72s -> 3206.44s]  Is there bats? They- what else is in
[3206.44s -> 3211.85s]  this game?
[3211.85s -> 3213.13s]  All right, I'm gonna be- there's so
[3213.13s -> 3217.77s]  much shit down here.
[3217.85s -> 3230.76s]  That does just hurt my fucking neck and
[3230.76s -> 3232.73s]  back.
[3232.73s -> 3234.81s]  I don't think it's worth me doing this.
[3234.81s -> 3237.88s]  Let me just go over here, get up the
[3237.88s -> 3244.28s]  sword.
[3244.28s -> 3245.72s]  Look at all this shit. Okay, hold on.
[3245.72s -> 3256.34s]  Diamonds. This goes so deep.
[3256.34s -> 3262.01s]  I'm almost out of pickaxe fluid.
[3262.01s -> 3263.13s]  All right, it's time to go back up. I
[3263.13s -> 3271.06s]  gotta go back up.
[3271.06s -> 3274.07s]  Almost. I got plenty though. That's
[3274.07s -> 3274.95s]  good.
[3274.95s -> 3279.99s]  Let me get them all before it
[3279.99s -> 3305.53s]  breaks. Good. Okay,
[3305.53s -> 3307.93s]  time to get out of here. I hear
[3307.93s -> 3311.29s]  water right there.
[3311.29s -> 3316.58s]  What the hell was that? Why did a
[3316.58s -> 3318.02s]  horror movie door just open?
[3318.02s -> 3332.46s]  Is it a dungeon? All right, I'm gonna
[3332.46s -> 3334.30s]  remember this then. Remember this.
[3334.30s -> 3339.85s]  All right, let's go up. I- I can't go
[3339.85s -> 3341.50s]  up.
[3341.50s -> 3343.18s]  I have to- I have to make a crafting
[3343.18s -> 3344.38s]  bench down here.
[3344.38s -> 3352.73s]  No, I have a secret one. Okay,
[3352.73s -> 3362.41s]  never mind. I heard a car.
[3362.41s -> 3367.96s]  All right, let's go- let's get the
[3367.96s -> 3369.00s]  hell out of here.
[3369.00s -> 3374.62s]  I can get a couple of these if I
[3374.62s -> 3378.66s]  really want. I'm doing that the
[3378.66s -> 3380.94s]  worst possible way.
[3380.94s -> 3382.46s]  Might- might as well get them all,
[3382.46s -> 3403.13s]  right? This has got to be some kind
[3403.13s -> 3404.01s]  of record of
[3404.01s -> 3410.60s]  coal in one spot. It just never ends.
[3410.60s -> 3431.19s]  Oh, we unveiled the secret iron. Go on,
[3431.19s -> 3432.94s]  is that it?
[3432.94s -> 3434.62s]  That's it. All right, I guess go up
[3434.62s -> 3436.71s]  here.
[3436.71s -> 3439.27s]  I see- there's dirt right there, which
[3439.27s -> 3441.11s]  means I'm at land,
[3441.11s -> 3444.82s]  where I will be in a second. The best
[3444.82s -> 3446.02s]  part of Minecraft is when you come
[3446.02s -> 3447.62s]  out of the sewer hole.
[3447.62s -> 3450.84s]  Ugh! Uh, and you just look around and
[3450.84s -> 3477.30s]  see where you are.
[3477.30s -> 3505.88s]  Uh, okay, a little bit more. Now let's
[3505.88s -> 3512.65s]  see where we're gonna end up.
[3512.65s -> 3517.03s]  How far did- uh, down did I go?
[3517.03s -> 3537.86s]  What? I can't be that much further.
[3542.26s -> 3546.49s]  Uh-oh. Where's my- where's my trail? Where's my trail?
[3546.49s -> 3548.14s]  Where was that? That was real cool.
[3548.14s -> 3549.66s]  Where- okay, where- where's my trail?
[3549.66s -> 3550.54s]  Right there.
[3550.54s -> 3566.98s]  Oh my god, I'm dead! Oh my god, I'm dead!
[3566.98s -> 3570.02s]  Oh, go! What's happening? Go!
[3570.02s -> 3596.94s]  Okay, here we go. Cook. Eat. I got
[3596.94s -> 3598.92s]  seven out of ten.
[3598.92s -> 3603.78s]  All right, let me- let me go- hold on.
[3603.78s -> 3608.02s]  Let's, uh, no, no, no, no, no. What do I need?
[3608.02s -> 3613.88s]  Focus. Focus, Mike, focus. Don't say
[3613.88s -> 3614.92s]  your real name, though.
[3614.92s -> 3622.17s]  People will fucking know. Don't know who you are.
[3622.17s -> 3625.70s]  All right, let's just make a fucking bunch of these.
[3625.70s -> 3643.14s]  I'm gonna make 64 of them. Perfect number.
[3643.14s -> 3647.32s]  All right, now I need to- I gotta put them in here.
[3647.32s -> 3659.34s]  So give me the hell out of here. That's all I want. Just enough so I can see
[3659.34s -> 3663.59s]  what the hell I'm doing later. All right, where's that meat?
[3663.59s -> 3670.06s]  I need to cook the meat in the furnace, so let's get that meat.
[3670.06s -> 3676.89s]  Okay, put it down here. Gotta eat the egg sack.
[3676.89s -> 3693.78s]  There we go. Perfect. Why is this screen flashing? It's because I'm
[3693.78s -> 3700.76s]  dying. Once I have a couple of cooked
[3700.84s -> 3707.13s]  meats, I'll be just fine. For instance, how do you eat it?
[3707.13s -> 3725.37s]  You actually have to put it in your mouth, though. Okay, um,
[3725.37s -> 3730.09s]  don't kill it. Is that rare? Were the squids- I think they were squids
[3730.09s -> 3734.54s]  when I played before. I don't think I can really remember.
[3734.54s -> 3740.95s]  All right, let's move. Let's- I gotta make some gear.
[3740.95s -> 3750.14s]  Let's make some iron helmets. All right, this is just a joke.
[3750.14s -> 3754.39s]  Why is there no sell button? How come- why can't I have like a little
[3754.39s -> 3756.95s]  thing over here that I can just drag and it just sells it?
[3756.95s -> 3767.10s]  All right, get the spider sack thing out of here.
[3767.10s -> 3771.74s]  Wheat seeds, oak saplings, get out of here.
[3771.74s -> 3774.54s]  All right, I need to make a bunch of shit. All right, I'm gonna make my
[3774.54s -> 3776.78s]  house out of- I'm gonna make the floor out of wood.
[3776.78s -> 3781.64s]  And the walls out of stone. Get all this. What the hell?
[3781.64s -> 3800.81s]  Andesite? D.O. Wright? What are these? The new materials?
[3800.81s -> 3804.17s]  I'm gonna hold on to them just in case I need them. I need- let's make
[3804.17s -> 3808.65s]  some shit. So I need sticks. Let's go over here.
[3808.65s -> 3824.46s]  All right, we got- just make a bunch. Now let's go with
[3824.46s -> 3830.22s]  one, two. I'm going to make- oh, you have to smelt the iron into bars,
[3830.22s -> 3839.70s]  right? We need to start that process. Come
[3839.70s -> 3847.74s]  here. Go for it. And then I can make iron
[3847.74s -> 3856.95s]  pickaxe, iron sword, iron shield, iron armor. So, did you see any good
[3856.95s -> 3862.25s]  movies? D.O. Wright, Andesite, and Granite are
[3862.25s -> 3874.47s]  cosmetic stones. Okay. You can dual wield? Why am I in my swim
[3874.47s -> 3884.38s]  trunks? Guys, it's a nice day today. And
[3884.38s -> 3893.75s]  I didn't go swimming. I wanted to though.
[3893.75s -> 3897.82s]  How did something get in my eye? How is that possible?
[3897.82s -> 3901.90s]  How is it possible that something got in my eye? I was locked in. I was
[3901.90s -> 3909.62s]  pressured closed in here. How long has it been? Have I
[3909.62s -> 3914.70s]  been playing Minecraft for an hour? I've been in Minecraft VR for an
[3914.70s -> 3926.55s]  hour and six minutes. What the fuck?
[3926.55s -> 3930.81s]  Yeah, I've been having fun. Told you, I'm gonna get to diamonds.
[3930.81s -> 3934.97s]  I'm gonna make a diamond pickaxe. Then I'm gonna swing as hard as I can down
[3934.97s -> 3949.67s]  through my stomach in an uninstalled game. All right.
[3949.67s -> 3955.53s]  That was weird. Oh, I need water too. Where's my-
[3955.53s -> 3964.34s]  Can somebody guide me? Recipe for disaster. Recipe for disaster. Recipe for disaster. Recipe for disaster.
[3964.34s -> 3992.95s]  I need a fucking straw. I need a tube. Drinking is really hard when you
[3992.95s -> 3997.91s]  can't see. Why? We do it so often. We do it every day.
[3997.91s -> 4002.23s]  Thousands of times a week. Why is it so hard to do anything?
[4002.23s -> 4015.40s]  Where's the other iron? Right there. 14. Let me get this.
[4015.40s -> 4023.10s]  Close this up. What? Just happened. Green's
[4023.10s -> 4027.42s]  tea sip has made the advancement. Why is this in my other hand?
[4027.42s -> 4035.11s]  How do I get that out of my hand? How do I take this off?
[4035.11s -> 4047.46s]  Maybe do I want- How do I get this off? Okay.
[4047.46s -> 4058.50s]  Let me- I don't like that. Is there a reason why I can't grab this?
[4058.50s -> 4073.86s]  No. What happened? What did I do? Too far away?
[4073.86s -> 4081.18s]  I don't think- No. They usually have the cursor. It's in the slot.
[4081.18s -> 4087.26s]  Yeah, but- Okay. Ready? See? Open the furnace. Cursor's gone.
[4087.26s -> 4105.29s]  It's your finger. No, it's not. Did the game lose focus? I don't think so.
[4105.29s -> 4125.37s]  I didn't- It did. I don't know how. I told you.
[4125.37s -> 4135.18s]  Can we get a round of applause for VR, Josh? This is my favorite song.
[4135.18s -> 4138.70s]  All right, so let's make some good tools.
[4138.70s -> 4152.07s]  Over here. So let's do the most important one.
[4152.07s -> 4163.48s]  Solar paneling. I'm gonna make two of these.
[4163.48s -> 4173.24s]  What- This is a helmet, right? This is a chest piece?
[4173.24s -> 4188.46s]  What's the chest? I know this is legs. Or I thought it was.
[4188.46s -> 4197.14s]  All right, should I make boots? Should I make- Should I make tools first?
[4197.14s -> 4200.18s]  I'm gonna make tools first. I don't care if it's wrong.
[4200.18s -> 4211.32s]  I might never see iron ever again. Extreme backup.
[4211.32s -> 4224.71s]  Make another sword. Another pickaxe. I have three pickaxe- three iron pickaxes.
[4224.71s -> 4228.62s]  I have two right now. And I also- I want a shovel, too.
[4228.62s -> 4243.59s]  I want two shovels. And- Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? What's going on?
[4243.67s -> 4252.58s]  What's going on with my axe? What's wrong? What's wrong?
[4252.58s -> 4261.69s]  What's going on? You only need two- I'm fine. I'm good.
[4261.69s -> 4270.10s]  I use the shovel a lot. Okay, so that's
[4270.10s -> 4282.66s]  one, two, three. One, two. Let's get this down here.
[4282.66s -> 4286.92s]  I'm not going to use that right now. All right, storage.
[4286.92s -> 4297.10s]  Is it an iron pick? Yeah. Put the the deal right of the shit in here.
[4297.10s -> 4302.15s]  Put the iron in there. I'm gonna keep the meat on me.
[4302.15s -> 4305.83s]  I'm gonna keep, oh, some coal. Not all of it, just in case something horrible
[4305.83s -> 4310.81s]  happens. Eleven. That's fine. I'm gonna put that
[4310.81s -> 4317.62s]  there. I got this here. Sticks. Don't need them.
[4317.62s -> 4322.10s]  Birch. Planks. Sand. Don't need sand anymore. Don't need dirt. Get them out
[4322.10s -> 4352.12s]  of here. Let me just get rid of these.
[4352.12s -> 4357.00s]  What was it? It was like- it was some weird button. I did it before.
[4357.00s -> 4370.06s]  There it is. Okay. Time to build the house. You ready?
[4370.06s -> 4375.03s]  You ready for the most boring part of this whole stream? Or it could be fun.
[4375.03s -> 4383.16s]  I'll do it quick. Don't worry. I thought those were all monsters.
[4383.16s -> 4386.52s]  Oak. Cobblestone. Let's at least get a nice floor.
[4386.52s -> 4412.17s]  I can't believe he doesn't even have a texture pack. Unbelievable.
[4412.17s -> 4417.26s]  Use your shovel. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.
[4417.26s -> 4445.24s]  That's why I made two. This is sick. Really not bad. Not, not bad.
[4445.24s -> 4455.85s]  Just as a method to my madness. Just wait. Clear this out.
[4455.85s -> 4463.22s]  It's not gonna be perfect, but at least look alright. There, there. Shit just
[4463.22s -> 4480.12s]  floats, right? Yeah. Yeah. Is it all-
[4480.12s -> 4489.38s]  Should I just keep- should I have the bodies down here?
[4489.38s -> 4502.71s]  No, no, no, no, no. Don't sleep. Leave the bed. Not yet.
[4502.71s -> 4516.38s]  What are you doing? Get- Alright. Looking good.
[4516.38s -> 4520.06s]  Okay. How do you- how do you even like do
[4520.06s -> 4523.26s]  Minecraft commentary? How do I even like say what it is?
[4523.26s -> 4529.54s]  Okay, there we are. We got wood here now, folks. Alright.
[4529.54s -> 4535.74s]  Looks pretty good. Hey, did I tell you I had jury duty?
[4535.74s -> 4549.37s]  Yeah. Here's a kind of chair. Ah, it don't matter.
[4549.37s -> 4558.54s]  Does it matter if I don't have that here? Switch shovel.
[4558.54s -> 4562.62s]  Oh shit. Is it button on my hand to it?
[4562.62s -> 4567.40s]  Alright. Holy shit. People must so support.
[4567.40s -> 4579.18s]  Wow. This is- you can't do this in regular Minecraft.
[4579.18s -> 4589.69s]  You can? Oh. Well. Oh, well. No, don't do that. Alright, that's good.
[4589.69s -> 4595.66s]  Something I think a lot of you guys might underestimate
[4595.66s -> 4599.74s]  or overestimate is the fact that if I have a piece of green here that I'm
[4599.74s -> 4620.02s]  not- it's okay. I'm gonna be fine. I'm not gonna look- I'm not
[4620.02s -> 4623.22s]  gonna look at chat. I'm not gonna look. I already know what
[4623.22s -> 4631.13s]  you're saying. I already know what you're saying. I don't need to look.
[4631.13s -> 4640.25s]  How do I use this? This is slower than doing it with-
[4640.25s -> 4659.08s]  This is slower. I should be doing sword in this hand.
[4659.08s -> 4663.26s]  No, I didn't see the short joke. I saw that I'm not using my shovel.
[4663.26s -> 4667.10s]  What the- that- why do I have two ice creams?
[4667.10s -> 4671.50s]  All I need is one. And why the fuck is this one not chocolate
[4671.50s -> 4702.68s]  is what I want to ask. Kill fish. I got it. Look at that house.
[4702.68s -> 4717.34s]  That's worth a million. That'll be worth a million someday.
[4717.34s -> 4722.44s]  A million of what? A million racy's pacy's.
[4722.44s -> 4727.72s]  So let's- it's not done. Don't say it's bad until it's done.
[4727.72s -> 4736.68s]  Just wait for my walk-in closet in my open kitchen.
[4736.68s -> 4781.16s]  Just saying. I'm not even gonna look at the chat. I don't even need to.
[4781.16s -> 4784.23s]  Why would I need to look at it? I already know how to do this. I don't
[4784.23s -> 4786.39s]  know how to play this. Guys, I think I'm moving forward. I
[4786.39s -> 4800.07s]  think I'm gonna have no chat. Yeah, I think- what do you think?
[4800.07s -> 4828.34s]  Shit. I mean now I'm just- I'm just playing Minecraft.
[4828.34s -> 4831.54s]  This is what I do every time. Every single time I've ever opened this
[4831.54s -> 4840.17s]  game. It goes the same way. No differences.
[4840.17s -> 4846.28s]  This is the same house that I make. It's only just dirt on the top,
[4846.28s -> 4850.44s]  wood on the bottom, cobblestone on the sides. And then I put a door on
[4850.44s -> 4855.90s]  and then I go down and I look for diamonds. I've groundhog day'd this
[4855.90s -> 4867.40s]  scenario probably 40 times. The only- the only
[4867.40s -> 4879.90s]  this time I'm actually in it. I'm here right now. So like I said
[4880.06s -> 4882.62s]  there's a lot of the potential like this. Some
[4882.62s -> 4887.75s]  you know young kids here right now. Made a reference to it before.
[4887.75s -> 4891.27s]  I'm not that good. I'm pretty- I do some like inter- I'll make like a
[4891.27s -> 4896.15s]  kitchen eventually here. But I don't expect me to like know
[4896.15s -> 4901.51s]  how to do the lanterns or the
[4901.51s -> 4911.35s]  electric stone cubes, redstone. I don't know how to do that. I'm out
[4911.35s -> 4921.34s]  of stone. I'm actually out of stone. All right.
[4921.34s -> 4926.46s]  Now I'm good to go for another adventure. I got meat.
[4926.46s -> 4932.63s]  This is what I like to do. Hey kids this is how I do it. Find a corner of
[4932.63s -> 4935.59s]  your house and turn it into the basement. And then
[4935.59s -> 4944.94s]  the basement goes down into the mine. This is how I do it. So let's go over
[4944.94s -> 4953.29s]  here. You know I'm gonna just take this
[4953.29s -> 4958.71s]  off. Like this- this- this is not happening.
[4959.35s -> 4964.66s]  I'm gonna be honest with you. So for instance now I'm gonna- there's a
[4964.66s -> 4970.12s]  front door. Open. Here we are. This leads down.
[4970.12s -> 4982.20s]  It's gonna go down like this. This is my basement. See we're
[4982.20s -> 4988.90s]  gonna get some steps. Move it more forward again. Another
[4988.90s -> 5012.12s]  step. What is that? Okay. This is gonna be
[5012.12s -> 5014.84s]  paved. I'm gonna pave that whole thing.
[5014.84s -> 5029.85s]  Here we go. One, two, three, four, five.
[5029.85s -> 5037.66s]  Go down again. Make sure you bring enough light.
[5037.66s -> 5044.44s]  I can take that one back. All right. One more.
[5044.44s -> 5062.86s]  Right. Are you following along? You following along here?
[5062.86s -> 5066.98s]  There we go. What do you think? Too deep. Too deep.
[5066.98s -> 5082.10s]  Keep torch in left hand. That's not a bad idea.
[5082.10s -> 5086.65s]  Resident sleeper. There's 31 torches in my hand.
[5086.65s -> 5097.72s]  Holy shit. I didn't even know you could do that. Look.
[5097.72s -> 5104.73s]  I lost a bet. That's why I'm here. I think that's good for now.
[5104.73s -> 5111.78s]  This way. Gonna carve out a little section.
[5111.78s -> 5120.22s]  A little more over here. How you doing? Sleepy yet?
[5120.22s -> 5129.80s]  How you feeling? You okay? Got a headache? You got a running nose?
[5129.80s -> 5140.02s]  Fucking sorry to hear that. Oh sorry. I'm flipping sorry to hear that.
[5140.02s -> 5144.79s]  All right. Let's keep going. This is where it gets interesting at.
[5144.79s -> 5154.76s]  Uh what? Negative like 20 below. I didn't dig straight down.
[5154.76s -> 5162.54s]  I clearly came down on a little staircase. Don't be afraid to say you
[5162.54s -> 5170.01s]  like this and you're enjoying it. I am. This is fun. You know I'm just
[5170.01s -> 5176.20s]  I'm just talking shit guys. That's all. Don't take anything I say seriously.
[5176.20s -> 5195.43s]  I'm just kidding around. I'm just talking about. Never mind.
[5195.43s -> 5202.31s]  Okay. Actually I won. I hear something.
[5202.31s -> 5206.39s]  We're getting to a point where I need to get prepared with a sword.
[5206.39s -> 5227.78s]  Is that a special song? And I think it's behind one of these doors.
[5227.86s -> 5240.68s]  That's it's kind of stone. What is that? Granite. They had so many different
[5240.68s -> 5270.12s]  cosmetic rocks. Can something happen?
[5270.12s -> 5303.22s]  Stop. Calm down. Calm down. Where's my little like
[5303.22s -> 5306.82s]  uh seismograph meter? Don't I have one of those?
[5306.82s -> 5320.71s]  Look up. Are those motorcycles in my room?
[5320.71s -> 5348.52s]  I'm in VR. I can't tell. Damn it. I gotta get up there.
[5348.52s -> 5372.18s]  Oh shit. There's even more. I just realized something. This was not
[5372.18s -> 5378.82s]  intentionally planned or anything but the next game that I'm gonna play
[5378.82s -> 5382.50s]  is having a realization about something. You'll see.
[5382.50s -> 5396.17s]  Oh no. That was the thing breaking. Okay. How about
[5396.17s -> 5406.28s]  uh I feel like everyone might leave on the next game.
[5406.28s -> 5416.52s]  Everybody came here because like oh Minecraft VR. Cool.
[5416.52s -> 5424.57s]  I don't get lost down here. Those are more for breadcrumbs than
[5424.57s -> 5437.24s]  anything else. Am I playing this on peaceful? You know it's on survival.
[5437.24s -> 5447.75s]  At least it should be. I'm playing this on creative mode.
[5447.75s -> 5467.29s]  Always get away back up. We're getting deep. I hear running water.
[5467.29s -> 5474.82s]  Right. I think I'm in the ocean right now.
[5474.82s -> 5479.21s]  This is baffling tile. What is this? What kind of
[5479.21s -> 5493.56s]  rock is that? Does it have a name? Get it.
[5493.56s -> 5514.63s]  Okay. Oh I was already down here. All right.
[5514.63s -> 5524.94s]  There was all kinds of shit. There's more of uh that whatever the hell that is.
[5524.94s -> 5543.46s]  God damn it. I tried. Light. I want more light.
[5543.46s -> 5587.64s]  I'm going all the way down. Hey. Oh I'm fine. Can you come up here?
[5587.64s -> 5591.93s]  I'll just farm him. Come on up. Was there a baby?
[5591.93s -> 5614.17s]  There's a baby zombie. Where's the baby? Where'd the baby go?
[5614.17s -> 5644.46s]  No don't do that. Jesus. If I drop down there I'm just gonna die.
[5646.18s -> 5662.58s]  What? What the where? I'm so confused. What happened? Where? I just got
[5662.58s -> 5679.74s]  something. Nothing even hit me. Why am I wearing bathing shorts? That's not
[5679.74s -> 5694.22s]  important. Hey. Hey. See you later kid.
[5694.22s -> 5703.34s]  Double cigar. Please think it was funny. Please think it was funny. Please
[5703.34s -> 5707.42s]  think it was funny. Please think it was funny. Please think it was funny.
[5707.42s -> 5733.48s]  Yes. All right I'll come back to that. Is it gone?
[5733.48s -> 5751.10s]  Yeah. Made it out alive. Minecraft VR. Not even a problem.
[5751.42s -> 5757.37s]  I can smell diamonds. I think I'm gonna fall into a diamond pit right here.
[5757.37s -> 5771.80s]  How can you tell when you're close to diamonds? Look at how they're even
[5771.80s -> 5796.87s]  deeper. Wow. Do those hurt you? Or are they just
[5796.87s -> 5843.38s]  annoying? Found it. Oh my god there was one in my face.
[5843.38s -> 5877.43s]  Oh no it hurt. God. Minecraft is really just a horror game.
[5877.43s -> 5881.83s]  In VR it's just scary monsters around corners.
[5881.83s -> 5909.54s]  Have I been here before? I don't think I've been down here before.
[5909.54s -> 5912.42s]  That really did feel like I was playing and
[5912.42s -> 5916.87s]  somebody in chat was just spawning stuff in front of me.
[5916.87s -> 5921.14s]  Like I have twitch enabled and it's spawn creeper.
[5921.14s -> 5938.55s]  No. I'll take more iron. I've missed a bunch of it too. It's been
[5938.55s -> 5956.70s]  panicking. What is that? No. Sick. Okay. Might as well get it all. For one
[5956.70s -> 5959.18s]  second I thought I was back in my basement and was like how did that
[5959.18s -> 5977.99s]  happen? I can't wear it. I hear the music.
[5977.99s -> 5982.20s]  That means I'm getting close right to something. Doesn't the music start
[5982.20s -> 5993.94s]  uh trigger when you get near something cool?
[5993.94s -> 6002.01s]  I'm going in too deep. I'm going in too deep. I have to stop. I gotta- I don't
[6002.01s -> 6008.30s]  know where I'm gonna end up. I'm gonna end up in a completely
[6008.30s -> 6013.94s]  different place. I gotta go back. Did it keep going? I need to- I need
[6013.94s -> 6018.90s]  to know where I am. I'm- I'm gonna be lost. Seriously I have to put
[6018.90s -> 6021.62s]  these everywhere because I'll fucking forget.
[6021.62s -> 6058.89s]  Not gonna lay without you anymore. Yeah. Yeah. You're hiding on me. It's fine.
[6058.89s -> 6062.81s]  All right. I'm almost out of- I- I can't keep going.
[6062.81s -> 6081.02s]  I'm almost out of power. Got it. Redstone. There it is.
[6081.02s -> 6087.06s]  Now I can not know how to make anything because I have no idea.
[6087.06s -> 6105.61s]  What's this? Bluestone. All right.
[6107.77s -> 6141.53s]  Bear back. I'm gonna go uh I'm gonna take this so bear back.
[6141.61s -> 6145.21s]  First rule. I know. I know. I only did- I did it like three times. I haven't done
[6145.21s -> 6153.03s]  that the entire game. I dug down three times. I didn't do
[6153.03s -> 6158.15s]  that the other times. The one time that I do it. I do it
[6158.15s -> 6168.06s]  like twice. No that's not even like-
[6168.06s -> 6172.95s]  What if- I'm fucking so stupid. I was down so deep too. I should have known
[6172.95s -> 6190.39s]  better. I haven't played uh whatever. Don't dig straight down. But it's
[6190.39s -> 6198.06s]  different when you're uh- I can't even give an excuse.
[6198.06s -> 6201.86s]  I'll be right back. I'm gonna take piss because of water in my face.
[6201.86s -> 6206.70s]  Refill my cup after I drink it. There are literally shirts that say that.
[6206.70s -> 6213.90s]  I know. I thought I had at least like one or two seconds to do it.
[6213.90s -> 6351.78s]  Oh whatever. I'll be right back. I can get back there. My stuff is still okay
[6351.78s -> 6365.29s]  right? It burnt in the one square. It had
[6365.29s -> 6372.55s]  to be the square right there too. I'm so embarrassed. God damn it.
[6372.55s -> 6378.86s]  Because that's like okay. That happened to people
[6378.86s -> 6382.46s]  four or five years ago and that was like oh what don't dig down in
[6382.46s -> 6399.29s]  Minecraft. It's 2013. Watch this guy burn because he
[6399.29s -> 6407.53s]  fell down in a cube in Minecraft. Oh by the way no it's not 2011.
[6407.53s -> 6427.14s]  It's 2019. Uh did somebody just give a hundred bucks right now?
[6427.14s -> 6430.50s]  I just pulled my headset off. I'm looking at a hundred dollars
[6430.58s -> 6435.85s]  from CabBadger. That is a fantastic shirt Jeremy. Where'd you get it?
[6435.85s -> 6445.40s]  Uh it was a gift. I actually don't know. But thank you CabBadger for the
[6445.40s -> 6448.84s]  hundred dollars and Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. I can't say that now.
[6448.84s -> 6460.25s]  Thank you for the community subs. Thank you. Yeah it was gifted to me.
[6460.25s -> 6469.45s]  Are we gonna go swimming later? No. I even did the JermaCraft thing.
[6469.45s -> 6471.85s]  All right one more thing. I just want one more try. I just want to get-
[6471.85s -> 6478.76s]  hold on. Let me just get down. I'm gonna do
[6478.76s -> 6480.68s]  one more try and then we're gonna move on.
[6480.68s -> 6492.02s]  Like I'm so pissed off that that's how it ends. People are gonna watch
[6492.02s -> 6500.22s]  that clip and it's gonna be like- the people are just gonna shake their heads
[6500.22s -> 6513.56s]  and be like oh well that good- good job.
[6513.56s -> 6517.46s]  How many did I go down? How many did I go down?
[6517.46s -> 6544.86s]  One, two, three, four, five. You guys let me do that six times?
[6544.86s -> 6549.62s]  I can't believe I did that six times. I just got complacent.
[6549.62s -> 6559.13s]  All right can I- what is this putting me? Your house is missing.
[6559.13s -> 6562.17s]  All right can- is really every single
[6562.17s -> 6569.11s]  solitary item burnt completely. Every single item is burnt
[6569.11s -> 6589.34s]  in that one square. It's not even hard to get that shit.
[6589.34s -> 6605.80s]  Oh Tetris. No it's really not. Plus didn't I save some-
[6605.80s -> 6618.07s]  I saved some stuff didn't I? There it is. We're going back in there.
[6618.07s -> 6622.50s]  Look I'm about to sell somebody a watch.
[6622.50s -> 6628.41s]  Oh let me see the diamond on that. Let's see.
[6628.41s -> 6631.37s]  It looks like it's gone through a little bit of
[6631.37s -> 6648.07s]  erosion. Hold on. 250. I have a request. Lose the shorts.
[6648.07s -> 6663.24s]  All right. All right yeah I just pulled it out of my fucking ear again.
[6663.24s -> 6675.38s]  Let's go. What is- something's pulling my hair.
[6675.38s -> 6679.58s]  Explain the shorts. There is no- something is odd here.
[6679.58s -> 6692.95s]  What is doing this? I don't- what do you mean- there is nothing to explain.
[6692.95s -> 6697.98s]  I still can't believe you did that lava thing. Look it- it's a- look I still
[6697.98s -> 6701.66s]  have iron. I can make a sword or I can make a-
[6701.66s -> 6705.02s]  probably make a shovel. No I'm gonna make a sword. And then I
[6705.02s -> 6711.67s]  can make- everything's fine. Don't worry.
[6711.67s -> 6722.68s]  Let's do it. That's why you make these.
[6722.68s -> 6725.72s]  Not total- actually it's probably for the best that that happened.
[6731.35s -> 6742.89s]  I had so much trash. All right now- hmm.
[6742.89s -> 6775.99s]  Any shovels? Where's the audio? I feel like I'm missing audio here. Okay.
[6775.99s -> 6793.86s]  My torches. Fuck. All my torches are gone.
[6793.86s -> 6816.01s]  That should be good. Maybe- maybe uh- no. I'll get some more.
[6816.01s -> 6822.28s]  I know that's fine. 64. Maximo. I'm going back in there. I don't have
[6822.28s -> 6836.06s]  any food but it's all right. What the hell? All right let's go.
[6836.06s -> 6843.38s]  Are you ready? Back in there. Back to get something.
[6843.38s -> 6853.06s]  Salvageable. We haven't seen a solo in stream
[6853.06s -> 6862.60s]  juke for so long. Bring woo- wood. What? Bring wood?
[6862.60s -> 6870.63s]  I don't have any food. It's all gone. All right I guess I could just go kill
[6870.63s -> 6886.15s]  something. I got a nice weapon here. I just
[6886.15s -> 6953.00s]  need like a cow or something right? Perfect. Okay food. Okay we're good.
[6953.00s -> 6966.41s]  Don't kill it? How am I supposed to get food? I got plenty of food now.
[6966.41s -> 7022.70s]  Food. 12 o'clock. I'm not gonna drown. Now I'm gonna store this food. I'll cook
[7022.70s -> 7044.98s]  some of it and then I'm time to go. How do I go faster? Okay fishing.
[7044.98s -> 7067.61s]  What the hell was that? Do they have like drowned zombies?
[7067.61s -> 7073.94s]  All right that's good. Time to cook it. Back here.
[7073.94s -> 7083.69s]  I'm going down there one more time. I'm gonna try to go down to where I
[7083.69s -> 7097.61s]  was and then get- and try to get diamonds.
[7097.61s -> 7106.33s]  This is actually pretty fun. You're doing shots of tequila for me.
[7106.33s -> 7113.96s]  Oh that's right. It's St. Patrick's Day. I'm playing Minecraft. What are you
[7113.96s -> 7119.85s]  doing? What are you doing on St. Patty's Day? How are you?
[7119.85s -> 7127.99s]  Bone meal. Raw salmon. Raw cod. All right let's do- let's cook the
[7127.99s -> 7133.88s]  chickens. Cook the chickens and eat the eggs
[7133.88s -> 7138.04s]  and have two full chickens and two sammons.
[7138.04s -> 7161.94s]  That sounds good to me. This is the sad song.
[7161.94s -> 7181.16s]  Why would Sour Please be here? I'm gonna eat that egg. How do I eat
[7181.16s -> 7189.64s]  the egg? It's raw? You can eat raw eggs in this game. I
[7189.64s -> 7213.67s]  thought you could. I can't eat a raw egg? Says who?
[7213.67s -> 7222.73s]  You don't eat eggs. And now I'm gonna knock down one tree
[7222.73s -> 7225.53s]  and get some wood in my inventory and then I'm going down there and
[7225.53s -> 7227.77s]  that's- that's it. But if it happens down there it's
[7227.77s -> 7232.15s]  over. I didn't even build a whole damn house.
[7232.15s -> 7238.70s]  It's an open floor plan guys. All right let's get some wood.
[7238.70s -> 7248.36s]  I'm gonna eat this. Let's go get some wood and then that's it.
[7248.36s -> 7269.27s]  Time to go adventure again. Down to the hill.
[7269.27s -> 7288.84s]  All right let's go. Just in case I need it for anything.
[7288.84s -> 7297.86s]  All right let's store this. Um I- I got a full chicken. I got plenty of
[7297.86s -> 7301.56s]  food. Torches. Get this out of here. Get
[7301.56s -> 7304.79s]  the rotten meat out of here. Kelp get it out of here.
[7304.79s -> 7308.15s]  Good. What's this? White wool. Don't need it.
[7308.15s -> 7320.79s]  Here we go. See I didn't do it here. I only did it in one
[7320.79s -> 7333.94s]  fucking place. I got all this dug out. What?
[7333.94s -> 7358.09s]  Oh shit. How did I even manage to do this?
[7358.09s -> 7366.15s]  Then I went down here. Right. Let's get some more padding for this
[7366.15s -> 7373.99s]  ball. All right I'm remembering. And then there
[7373.99s -> 7380.42s]  was a big fight down here. I panicked. I ran
[7380.42s -> 7448.15s]  that way. What the fuck? Okay um I don't know where I went.
[7448.15s -> 7479.48s]  I see an arrow. Where do I want to go back? Why do I want to go back? That's a
[7479.48s -> 7486.49s]  really actually- that's a great new point to go from here.
[7486.49s -> 7502.12s]  All right perfect. Build the inventory back up.
[7502.12s -> 7513.00s]  This way. That way. Let's just keep going across.
[7513.00s -> 7518.49s]  So I'm- I'm down pretty deep. Maybe I should put a bed down here.
[7518.49s -> 7548.04s]  Just keep progressing. I'm gonna go down.
[7548.04s -> 7571.59s]  I'll do that again. That shit's not gonna happen more than once.
[7571.59s -> 7597.16s]  Hello? Uh okay. Thank you. Does that mean something?
[7597.24s -> 7624.97s]  What does that mean? I'm not gonna get misdirected in this right?
[7624.97s -> 7639.94s]  And you're wondering why I brought so many tools? This is why.
[7639.94s -> 7655.91s]  Dump. When do I get to the- I'm gotta be close to getting to the bottom of
[7655.91s -> 7661.03s]  the world here. What cube is the bottom of the
[7661.03s -> 7709.27s]  world? Like cube 300 right? It's like 320 or something.
[7709.27s -> 7714.14s]  It's going so deep. First of all I'm-
[7714.14s -> 7718.38s]  I need to like- I'm about to- I can see there's a wall right there.
[7718.38s -> 7735.42s]  Well there's iron. Thankfully. I made it. I'm at the bottom of the world.
[7735.42s -> 7759.69s]  Yeah you can't dig through this right? I don't have an iron pickaxe.
[7759.69s -> 7768.36s]  Fuck. Smell the iron? All right yeah. Good idea.
[7768.36s -> 7824.06s]  Okay. Iron. All right here we go. Tools.
[7824.06s -> 7828.33s]  Why do I have these shorts on? Can we move on from the shorts?
[7828.33s -> 7837.98s]  Can we get away from the shorts here? I need-
[7837.98s -> 7848.15s]  I need a pickaxe for that. Do that right now.
[7848.23s -> 7861.14s]  One, two, three, and then here we go. I need a shovel. No I don't.
[7861.14s -> 7872.38s]  Um what's that? Armor? I'm gonna do a helmet
[7872.38s -> 7882.15s]  or a shield. How do we make a shield? I've never seen that before. I've never
[7882.15s -> 7894.41s]  made one. The shield is 10 shovels. 10 above
[7894.41s -> 7899.85s]  bedrock. Just open the green book. Ooh.
[7899.85s -> 7908.49s]  Isn't that fancy? So it's planks and then an iron
[7908.49s -> 7937.64s]  bar. Okay let's make it. Okay. Shield.
[7937.64s -> 7957.45s]  Now let's make helmet. Suit up. Yep. Helmet and we're gonna do with five.
[7957.45s -> 7974.71s]  Can I do anything with five? Boots. Things are looking up.
[7974.71s -> 7979.59s]  Things are looking up. I got a full chicken here. All right let's get out
[7979.59s -> 7990.25s]  of this. Boots. Helmet. Shield.
[7990.25s -> 7999.24s]  Shield. This shield. This is a cutting board.
[7999.24s -> 8006.25s]  Is this a stamp? How am I supposed to hold it like this?
[8006.25s -> 8014.87s]  I feel like this is an old-fashioned flash photography ball.
[8021.32s -> 8027.06s]  All right that's pretty cool. Put these torches back
[8027.06s -> 8033.74s]  and I'm good. Get the shovel down there.
[8033.74s -> 8039.80s]  I'm ready. I'm ready. I think I'm ready. Am I ready?
[8039.80s -> 8046.38s]  Block arrows with the shield. Nice. Make an iron bow. God damn it is what
[8046.38s -> 8053.85s]  they said. I can't. I don't have enough. I don't
[8053.85s -> 8060.79s]  have enough. I can't do it. Shears or flint and steel. That's
[8060.79s -> 8068.73s]  not real. I'm ready. I got chicken. I got my
[8068.73s -> 8071.93s]  sword. Is that this blocks my whole inventory?
[8071.93s -> 8100.14s]  All right I'm ready for minecon. You know what's the what's the chance that
[8100.14s -> 8107.67s]  there's lava in here? It's pretty high right? No get me
[8107.67s -> 8110.76s]  the fuck out of here. Get me out of this. I'm not doing
[8110.76s -> 8149.22s]  this. Okay safe. All right I'm good. Let's get the
[8149.22s -> 8162.34s]  hell out of here. I'm gonna go like up that way. Oh
[8162.34s -> 8172.98s]  god damn it. Okay um I'm gonna poke a hole in the
[8172.98s -> 8176.90s]  walls and I'm so paranoid about lava now after that happening before.
[8176.90s -> 8183.83s]  I'm just gonna stand up and like poke fucking holes in the walls.
[8183.83s -> 8190.54s]  Clear a nice section here. I'm also not going to use this
[8190.54s -> 8195.18s]  for just this bullshit. I'm gonna use this. It's a waste of resources.
[8195.18s -> 8220.46s]  All right let's switch back. Nice. What am I gonna do with this stuff?
[8220.46s -> 8235.06s]  It's not like it matters. I'm not gonna spend like all day in here.
[8235.06s -> 8262.17s]  Okay don't do that either. Right that's bad too. That's just as bad as
[8262.17s -> 8288.42s]  going down. What's going on up there? Nothing.
[8288.42s -> 8324.34s]  Okay it's safe. Kind of. Kind of safe. All right am I- I'm on the diamond level
[8324.34s -> 8342.74s]  right? Down here. What the fuck was that?
[8342.74s -> 8351.75s]  What the hell just- is that ASCII in 2019?
[8351.75s -> 8361.62s]  Oh wait have we got Justin TV? Oh is it Justin.tv or are we Twitch now?
[8361.62s -> 8373.75s]  Okay I'm ready. I'm gonna go this way. I'm at the diamond level.
[8373.75s -> 8377.37s]  Is it all I need? Is it all I want? I just want to get it and I want to
[8377.37s -> 8380.25s]  make a diamond sword in the diamond pickaxe and that's it. And then I'm
[8380.25s -> 8385.85s]  done. And then I could say I've done it all.
[8385.85s -> 8392.81s]  I've done it all. I've traveled to Japan. I've been to
[8392.81s -> 8396.49s]  France. I fucking- I fucking have a giant
[8396.49s -> 8399.85s]  empire of merchandising right? I sold like fucking
[8399.85s -> 8405.80s]  422 shirts. Empire. I played Minecraft VR got diamonds.
[8405.80s -> 8429.06s]  It's more than that by the way. No wrong. Can you imagine
[8429.06s -> 8433.18s]  running a fucking empire clothing company?
[8433.18s -> 8440.70s]  What's your day-to-day life like? Do you like hold up shirts and you're like
[8440.70s -> 8456.31s]  ah it sucks and you like tell them to start over?
[8456.31s -> 8486.70s]  Come on Minecraft. Where the hell are the diamonds? Press
[8486.70s -> 8491.82s]  F3 and see if you are at level 16 or below.
[8491.82s -> 8507.13s]  Um I- I can't do that right now. Iron. I might be able to make some more
[8507.13s -> 8522.47s]  stuff. Maybe a blouse. Maybe a t-shirt. Is
[8522.47s -> 8532.42s]  that it for- give me like a diamond patch.
[8532.42s -> 8537.94s]  That's all I want. I don't care. I don't even know how to get back to my
[8537.94s -> 8542.07s]  house. Do you think I care about what's going on at my
[8542.07s -> 8548.42s]  residence right now? No. That- but it wasn't even a house.
[8548.42s -> 8552.50s]  This is weird. Why is this here? This is dirt.
[8552.50s -> 8585.43s]  Okay. I got a straight shot. Is dirt this low?
[8585.43s -> 8630.22s]  Why is there dirt down here? Okay. I think we're good.
[8630.22s -> 8655.88s]  I'm so confused. Why is this here? Oh my god. Eat.
[8655.88s -> 8704.57s]  Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. That's pretty good. Yeah!
[8704.57s -> 8716.68s]  Resident Slaver. What is this? What does that look different?
[8716.68s -> 8720.28s]  All right. I'm out of here. I'm done. I'm just gonna do it or I'm just gonna
[8720.28s -> 8728.10s]  smelt it right now. I'm not waiting. There. Eight diamonds.
[8728.10s -> 8740.04s]  Look at those diamond eggs. And put that down.
[8740.04s -> 8759.30s]  64 redstone. Put it in there. Uh diamond axe. That's not what I want.
[8759.30s -> 8766.90s]  Diamond pickaxe. Got it. There it is.
[8766.90s -> 8797.90s]  Diamond sword. Diamond hoe. There it is. And she built. Yeah everyone's
[8797.90s -> 8808.07s]  talking shit. You talking shit about my fucking gonzo blade?
[8808.07s -> 8819.50s]  I did it. All right. I beat Minecraft. That was fun.
[8819.50s -> 8834.01s]  I didn't get like- I didn't use my diamond sword though. I can't just
[8834.01s -> 8841.26s]  not- I can't just give up now. Diamond sword. Look how fast it is.
[8841.26s -> 8846.34s]  What about it in real time? Way better.
[8846.34s -> 8875.30s]  You gotta be close though. That's the only thing. In before lava.
[8875.30s -> 8878.58s]  Uh I'm gonna be some position. I can just run that way.
[8878.58s -> 8910.18s]  I want to find a cave system. This is dark. This is really fun though.
[8910.18s -> 8918.23s]  This is a whole other way to experience playing this game.
[8918.23s -> 8928.26s]  In three dimensions. Uh what's that? Houston.
[8928.26s -> 8936.66s]  We've got a cave. Where is it? Was it this way?
[8936.66s -> 8961.13s]  So one person said yes. I listen to you. To heal. I got full health.
[8961.13s -> 8973.29s]  We're not only supposed to play this for an hour. Well I did have to
[8973.29s -> 8983.90s]  get diamonds. How long have I been playing this? Did I
[8983.90s -> 8995.50s]  just lose track of all time? It's almost three hours. Holy shit.
[8995.50s -> 8999.51s]  I'm- I am just me and I'm enjoying myself.
[8999.51s -> 9006.86s]  I'm gonna have to wake up a little bit though for the next uh game that's
[9006.86s -> 9022.41s]  coming up here in a minute once I find uh anything.
[9022.41s -> 9029.11s]  Is it- is it- no I'm safe. I'm safe. It's fine.
[9029.11s -> 9036.46s]  Everything's fine. It's right here. It's this block right here.
[9036.46s -> 9039.58s]  Come on kid. We gotta get out of here.
[9041.05s -> 9048.68s]  What does the Indiana Jones say? I'm surrounded by lava.
[9048.68s -> 9107.02s]  It's all here. Good thing. Good thing. I think it's actually up there. Stop.
[9107.02s -> 9116.54s]  I hear noises. I can hear skeletons and shit.
[9116.54s -> 9138.30s]  Where are they? There's lava somewhere over here.
[9138.30s -> 9140.54s]  They might be in like three or four different places. I think they're above
[9140.54s -> 9159.67s]  me. There's something above me. All right. I'm a safe place. That would
[9159.67s -> 9201.35s]  have been fucking really bad. Really? Where are these?
[9202.41s -> 9271.90s]  To the right. Okay. Found it. How big is this? This is gonna
[9271.90s -> 9274.94s]  lead to a bunch bigger system right? The lava's flowing this way.
[9274.94s -> 9310.73s]  Does that mean anything? Oh it is still here okay.
[9310.73s -> 9317.67s]  I'm playing with fire here like actually. Am I trying to make this hard
[9317.67s -> 9340.58s]  on myself? I need a light. Come on give me- leave
[9340.58s -> 9362.42s]  me somewhere. Leave me somewhere. It ends. I- I'm
[9362.42s -> 9374.18s]  getting out of here. I have to leave. I gotta- I'm leaving. How on earth am I
[9374.18s -> 9387.40s]  gonna navigate my way out of here? I'm not gonna dig up into lava. If I do
[9387.40s -> 9401.66s]  I can make a run for it. That looks all right.
[9401.66s -> 9414.70s]  We're safe. We're safe for now. Oh come on.
[9414.70s -> 9424.92s]  Give me something. I hear water. I don't think I want that to happen.
[9424.92s -> 9436.33s]  I might just turn around and go the other way. This means that this-
[9436.33s -> 9456.70s]  they're waterlogged right? Okay. Safe. Safe. Let's keep looking.
[9456.70s -> 9488.63s]  There's a spider. That means that there has to be land. Where's the spider?
[9488.63s -> 9499.69s]  Something going on up there. Water? Is there water up there?
[9499.69s -> 9519.88s]  I still hear the spider. I should be fine.
[9519.88s -> 9542.84s]  All right this- oh my god. Get rid of this.
[9542.84s -> 9550.23s]  I have so much cobblestone. It's like someone hasn't been paying attention
[9550.23s -> 9584.07s]  right? Something up here. Getting closer.
[9584.07s -> 9611.56s]  I'm gonna open up what- and there's gonna be just a window of somebody's
[9611.56s -> 9618.41s]  face. This might be water right here.
[9618.41s -> 9641.40s]  I actually have to be very careful about this. Did I just punch somebody?
[9641.48s -> 9663.86s]  What? I'm very confused. I don't hear anything.
[9663.86s -> 9683.74s]  They were right here. It was almost like I was standing right in front of them.
[9683.74s -> 9693.56s]  Anybody got any ideas? All right. No. I gotta stop fucking around. I gotta go.
[9693.56s -> 9697.62s]  I have to go up. We're just going up. If I die, I die.
[9697.62s -> 9720.42s]  It's all right. I'm over a cave somehow. I should have enough time to
[9720.42s -> 9735.46s]  run if there's something horrible right there.
[9739.22s -> 9753.77s]  Okay. I ain't even dealing with you at all.
[9753.77s -> 9790.36s]  What are you doing? Oh. Oops. Did I just sneak around them?
[9790.36s -> 9816.60s]  I mean I know this. I don't know what I'm stepping on. No.
[9816.60s -> 9827.69s]  I can just go all the way around them. They cannot fit through that.
[9827.69s -> 9835.45s]  There's not somebody behind me. You have to be right here.
[9835.45s -> 9891.96s]  He's like right in front of my face. Jesus.
[9891.96s -> 9925.18s]  Goddamn diamond pit gas! What's this thing even worth? Come on.
[9925.18s -> 9932.52s]  Get down here.
[9933.58s -> 9950.62s]  What the fuck are they all doing here? What the fuck are you doing here?
[9951.66s -> 9955.96s]  There's one of those spawners up here, ain't there? I gotta eat.
[9955.96s -> 9968.23s]  Do I have any more food? This sucks. Okay. There's a
[9968.23s -> 9995.53s]  bow and arrow. Why did that not block it? Why did that not block?
[9995.53s -> 10001.51s]  It went through the shield. I'm gonna die. I need to eat again.
[10001.51s -> 10012.49s]  What's happening with food? How do I throw these away?
[10012.49s -> 10073.27s]  I don't want them in here. No! Don't touch. Don't. I made it. I think I've
[10073.27s -> 10084.46s]  been here. Have I been here before? I don't think.
[10084.46s -> 10124.18s]  No. I haven't. I think there's another one. Oh.
[10124.18s -> 10139.82s]  No. Not deep. I don't want to go deeper. Oh my god. This looks like.
[10139.82s -> 10143.10s]  This looks like man. This looks man-made. This looks man-made.
[10143.10s -> 10151.85s]  I think this is man-made. It's man-made. Is that man-made?
[10151.85s -> 10203.94s]  What? There's no more lava to worry about down here.
[10203.94s -> 10232.30s]  We'll be fine. Almost there. Almost there. Then I mean on
[10232.30s -> 10274.44s]  water. Get down! All right. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
[10274.44s -> 10280.04s]  I, I, I'm fine. I have no idea. I have no idea what's going on with the back of my
[10280.04s -> 10286.23s]  head. What happened? What is it? What's,
[10286.23s -> 10299.86s]  what is this? Why is it doing this? I'm cheating right
[10299.86s -> 10317.74s]  now with my left eye. What's, what's going on? Is this going
[10317.74s -> 10344.01s]  down? What's this connected to? The cord is all the way up here.
[10344.01s -> 10354.09s]  What the fuck is this mess? How am I gonna get rid of this?
[10354.09s -> 10361.22s]  It was yanking me on the back of the head. Oh this is, this
[10361.22s -> 10370.55s]  is gonna take like 20 minutes to get out of this. I've been spinning around
[10370.55s -> 10385.22s]  that much. What was that? What was that? Why did
[10385.22s -> 10389.94s]  my house just fall down? Like what was that like crashing wood sound?
[10389.94s -> 10410.62s]  Where am I? Did I pull the cord out? I think I may have pulled a cord out.
[10410.62s -> 10442.47s]  Okay. Oh my lord. There's real tension here. I have to, I got to fix that
[10442.47s -> 10449.83s]  before we play another game. All right. What the hell happened?
[10449.83s -> 10467.48s]  Why am I, why is it just black? Am I a lot? I'm inside the wall. Okay
[10467.48s -> 10501.58s]  let's go back up. Am I dying? Come on. Go. Get up there.
[10501.58s -> 10518.79s]  Oh no. Where's my house? What's one of the four
[10518.79s -> 10557.10s]  horsemen doing here? What? What is that? That's rare?
[10557.10s -> 10568.50s]  What the fuck? Should I like go back and kill it?
[10568.50s -> 10574.30s]  It's split into, I don't even know where I am, where this is.
[10574.30s -> 10579.02s]  All right hold on. Let me take a look for a second. So
[10579.02s -> 10605.83s]  that's the creeper island. Is it that way? I don't know where my house is.
[10605.83s -> 10620.87s]  Where the hell was that? Maybe back, I think it was back here.
[10620.87s -> 10641.74s]  Down there. There he is. There he is. There they are. There they are. What do I do
[10641.74s -> 10666.14s]  about this? How do I do this? Okay. I'm gonna, what do I do? Run, grab stuff,
[10666.14s -> 10670.44s]  and then leave. I've got, I've got a diamond sword.
[10670.44s -> 10675.58s]  I have to at least try. Are there four of them?
[10675.58s -> 10695.10s]  What is he wearing on his head? What? There's a giant sea turtle?
[10695.10s -> 10700.60s]  Hello. You can, can you ride, you can, you can ride his back can't you?
[10700.68s -> 10713.11s]  Of course you can. No you can't. Where's my stuff?
[10713.11s -> 10767.02s]  You can't go in water right? No you can't. Come on you son of a bitch let's go.
[10767.02s -> 10799.86s]  Did you get everything? Most of it. Oh shit.
[10799.86s -> 10815.24s]  Damn. Gotta kill a fish and eat. Come here.
[10815.24s -> 10826.06s]  Should I try to go over that guy? Should I try to kill him? If I have full health
[10826.06s -> 10848.87s]  and it's just one, can I just bash his head in? I need more fish.
[10848.87s -> 10857.75s]  I'm going for him. Maybe if it's only one.
[10857.75s -> 10871.70s]  Oh fuck that's one of them. All right give me some more food.
[10871.70s -> 10881.98s]  Mind the like eyes of being blocked by my hair.
[10881.98s -> 10885.98s]  Don't I, I don't think I have one of those damn things.
[10885.98s -> 10921.56s]  No what are you doing? Give me the food. I want the food.
[10921.56s -> 10927.64s]  Ah. I'm gonna start healing now right? Good.
[10927.64s -> 10934.66s]  I'm gonna go after the ones over here. I feel like I can do it.
[10934.66s -> 10937.30s]  Because I had, there was like four of them at the same time. So that's why I
[10937.30s -> 10947.14s]  couldn't do anything about it before. Let me get some more food. Give it to
[10947.14s -> 10989.56s]  the boy. Oh my god I'm just hungry. I'm starving
[10989.56s -> 11015.66s]  the whole time. No. Give it. Am I supposed to go make
[11015.66s -> 11033.38s]  this food? I'm wasting so much time. They'll be there. See if I can get
[11033.38s -> 11050.09s]  this little school of fish. I got three.
[11050.09s -> 11057.61s]  Okay I'm good. Whatever. Just go. Back home.
[11057.61s -> 11067.46s]  Store the other shit that I have. Hey look I got another one.
[11067.46s -> 11075.14s]  Didn't even need to do anything. This makes me want to pick up
[11075.14s -> 11083.86s]  Minecraft again. Good way to de-stress. Yeah I know this is fun.
[11083.86s -> 11090.98s]  Get it. Don't let it just sit there. I would have moved on already.
[11090.98s -> 11096.73s]  But I'm just, I'm gonna do it. Might as well just do it.
[11096.73s -> 11103.03s]  Spend at least a few hours in here. Seems like they added a lot of
[11103.03s -> 11106.50s]  interesting stuff. That's the coolest part. Am I even
[11106.50s -> 11109.06s]  talking? I am. Weirdly enough I'm talking
[11109.06s -> 11115.06s]  right in the right direction. The last time I really gave any
[11115.06s -> 11118.98s]  care at all about this game. Had to have been at least four or five
[11118.98s -> 11122.02s]  years ago. I really wasn't into it that much
[11122.02s -> 11125.70s]  anyways. But coming back after all these years.
[11125.70s -> 11131.43s]  Hold that thought. There he goes. Coming back after all the years it just
[11131.43s -> 11134.55s]  seems like, like the sea turtles in the game.
[11134.55s -> 11137.59s]  That's odd. That's equally parts interesting and
[11137.59s -> 11141.59s]  like wow I'm surprised that they're still adding content to the game.
[11141.59s -> 11149.27s]  All right where where's my house? There it is.
[11149.27s -> 11163.82s]  This many years later. Is this a copy pasta?
[11163.82s -> 11184.50s]  It is now three hours in Minecraft. I'm surprised. Let me just fix this.
[11184.50s -> 11188.02s]  I'll go try to kill him and then we'll move on after that.
[11188.02s -> 11197.66s]  Let's eat. Get my shit together and I'm just gonna go
[11197.66s -> 11208.65s]  put up my hand. Oh all right. Food. I still got the shield still.
[11208.65s -> 11212.73s]  I can make some more armor which is good.
[11212.73s -> 11219.62s]  I don't think I have any. No god damn it.
[11219.62s -> 11224.87s]  I don't have any uh anything to make to burn this
[11224.87s -> 11231.94s]  oak. I have to use my like trees. I have wood yeah.
[11231.94s -> 11246.71s]  I don't have very much of it though. I need to make
[11246.71s -> 11255.80s]  look I have 23 iron ore. I might as well just get decked out.
[11255.80s -> 11259.56s]  Are they gonna despawn? Do I have to run back there quick?
[11259.56s -> 11271.61s]  They do so I gotta get the hell back there. I don't have time then.
[11271.61s -> 11274.33s]  Just put on. I got my clothes on right. I just gotta go over there and start
[11274.33s -> 11296.26s]  whacking them. My shield. Put it on. Armor.
[11296.26s -> 11303.18s]  There's no time. There's no time. He's there. This is the thing. They despawn.
[11303.18s -> 11306.22s]  One right there. One right there. I think there's another one. Let me get
[11306.22s -> 11324.94s]  a better view. Look at this one. What is that?
[11324.94s -> 11349.74s]  What is that? An Enderman. Right. Don't you need to look at them?
[11349.74s -> 11355.45s]  Wasn't I looking at them? Or are you not supposed to look at them?
[11355.45s -> 11361.38s]  It's one of those two. Don't look. I thought you were supposed to look.
[11361.38s -> 11365.06s]  Right. He came across the whole game. All right.
[11365.06s -> 11379.88s]  You. Is he still gonna be up there? Give me my stuff back.
[11379.88s -> 11406.31s]  Where's my sword? I have an arrow in the back of my head.
[11406.31s -> 11417.32s]  Just eat the raw salmon. Just twice. I don't care.
[11417.32s -> 11460.12s]  Whatever happens. Whatever happens happens. I'm going to
[11460.20s -> 11464.47s]  practice. I hear an explosion. All right. I'm going in.
[11464.47s -> 11484.14s]  Here we go. Where is he? Here we go. Through the trees. Through the bushes.
[11484.14s -> 11565.67s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Good luck. I'm killing this one.
[11565.67s -> 11638.20s]  Where is he? Where is he? Motherfucker. Where'd he go?
[11638.20s -> 11704.86s]  Shit. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
[11704.86s -> 11762.46s]  Oh fuck. Shit. Motherfucker. Did I do it? Did I do it? I think I
[11762.46s -> 11779.93s]  No. He jumped up. You already. You saw what happened. I don't need to explain it.
[11779.93s -> 11788.82s]  I gotta use the shield. When I used the shield last time, I just fucking killed me.
[11788.82s -> 11792.18s]  Oh, give me my stuff back. I'm blocking a minute. I had it.
[11792.82s -> 11800.25s]  I'm so upset right now. His body got up on the.
[11805.62s -> 11810.34s]  His body got up on the thing that I put up and he gave the perfect headshot.
[11811.06s -> 11817.37s]  That was it too. That was the one. I'm so sad about this. Look at that mess.
[11818.17s -> 11821.67s]  What am I doing? It's not funny. What are you doing?
[11822.71s -> 11827.61s]  I can still do it. Fuck food. Fuck everything. I'm gonna get up there.
[11827.61s -> 11852.42s]  I'm gonna get. Oh no. Don't look at me like that.
[11852.42s -> 11855.94s]  Okay. Here we go. I gotta make this jump. It's gonna be worth it.
[11856.82s -> 11860.12s]  I didn't fucking even jump. Un-fucking-believable. Video game.
[11866.18s -> 11871.86s]  Why didn't I jump? He's just perfect. He's perfect.
[11873.86s -> 11876.98s]  The cord is. I don't even. The cord is part of me now.
[11883.38s -> 11889.26s]  It's that. I did it. I did that. Where is he? Down here? He's right there.
[11899.72s -> 11905.22s]  Okay. I can do it with dirt. I'm trying this one more time.
[11905.86s -> 11930.26s]  Can I get my shoe? Nope. You have boots though. Here we go.
[11930.26s -> 11932.81s]  All right. Fuck you. Now you're dead.
[11969.96s -> 11986.34s]  Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Come on. It's right there. Get it.
[11986.34s -> 12000.58s]  Why can't I place the block? Stop. What the fuck is happening, Vi?
[12000.58s -> 12016.92s]  I gotta get on the other side. Oh, it's so hard to see.
[12016.92s -> 12022.92s]  You're looking far that. When I put my head down,
[12022.92s -> 12028.94s]  everything is blurred. Everything. It's so difficult to look down in any VR game.
[12029.50s -> 12103.58s]  I'm still alive? I got a better fucking idea.
[12103.58s -> 12110.10s]  Don't. Stop running. That's gonna drive me crazy.
[12125.61s -> 12135.67s]  Why do you keep doing that? I feel like I'm playing Fortnite.
[12135.67s -> 12138.73s]  This is just Fortnite. I'm playing Fortnite.
[12138.73s -> 12141.76s]  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill. Bob 06
[12141.76s -> 12167.54s]  Come down here. Do it. I'm setting a goddamn looting tunes track for you.
[12167.54s -> 12189.32s]  You coming?
[12189.32s -> 12194.39s]  Get in right here and then I'm gonna go bang, bang.
[12204.49s -> 12206.33s]  I'm gonna fucking scream in a second.
[12206.33s -> 12250.09s]  Okay, hold on. I gotta plan this. Get in here.
[12251.45s -> 12251.93s]  Come on.
[12251.93s -> 12269.14s]  Look, I'm over here. I'm right here. Don't you see me? Hey, hey, where is he? Where'd he go?
[12269.14s -> 12294.22s]  Oh, that's fine, that's fine. Stay there. Stay there. Right there. Anything else blocking his way?
[12294.22s -> 12318.45s]  You can't get in there! You can't fit in there. He needs two blocks. I don't have...
[12318.45s -> 12341.58s]  He's never gonna fucking get in here. He's never gonna go like this. Is he in? Is he in? Is he in?
[12341.58s -> 12345.35s]  Oh my god, oh my god. Don't move. Nobody move. Nobody fucking breathe. Don't breathe.
[12345.35s -> 12350.50s]  Nobody breathe. Nobody breathe. Nobody breathe. Don't breathe. Can you hear me talking?
[12350.50s -> 12365.83s]  I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got this motherfucker. He's done.
[12365.83s -> 12374.32s]  I got him. I got him. I actually got him. I trapped him. I trapped him! I did it!
[12374.32s -> 12400.73s]  Wait, what about over here? Stop it, Vibe. No, it's so dark. Oh my god, I hate this thing.
[12400.73s -> 12408.69s]  Get better goddamn technology for Christ's sake. It's cuz I'm putting my hand over my head.
[12408.97s -> 12430.81s]  Because I'm blind when I go like this. Is he in? Is he in? I can't tell. No, he's not.
[12430.81s -> 12437.92s]  The horse is dead. What? What do you mean the horse is friendly? What do you mean he's dead?
[12437.92s -> 12459.98s]  The rider is dead. So I can... Horse is not harmful. You sure? Oh man, are you sure about that?
[12459.98s -> 12481.73s]  So what do I do? What can I do? Oh wow. What happened? What happened? What happened again?
[12482.05s -> 12490.30s]  Goddamn better technology, I swear to god. What happened? I can't even... I didn't touch anything.
[12490.30s -> 12497.19s]  How would I suffocate in a wall? I didn't do anything. What happened? I gotta get back here now.
[12497.19s -> 12501.55s]  Why can I not touch any fucking thing on the screen? What? Why didn't it minimize the window?
[12501.55s -> 12518.69s]  I'm getting this fucking lobster, whatever it is. Quickly. Where is this way? Over here.
[12518.69s -> 12550.39s]  He's gonna get back over here. He's still there. We're fine. Slow down.
[12551.27s -> 12561.19s]  You guys are still questioning his sanity. So what can I do with this animal?
[12562.15s -> 12571.34s]  So, okay, I have... Do I, like, touch him? Can I pet him? How do I do this? Tame it.
[12573.11s -> 12586.81s]  Break the blocks. I need a saddle. Break roof. Break all the blocks. They're tamed.
[12586.81s -> 12605.99s]  Need a saddle. Break the blocks above him. Like up here. I don't need a saddle. Oh,
[12606.15s -> 12617.80s]  so much information. Touch him with an empty hand. The dirt blocks. That's wood. Like these.
[12622.76s -> 12645.83s]  Why do I need to get rid of those? What's he doing? Now ride it. What? Does he have a mind
[12645.83s -> 12660.38s]  of his own? I don't even have any items. I can't get out of here. What about my... What? No,
[12660.38s -> 12667.11s]  no, no, no. Don't do that again. This way. Out here. Wait, how do I get off? Grab
[12667.11s -> 12678.42s]  these shit. How do I jump off? How do you get off? Jump. I can't jump. I can't get off of
[12682.70s -> 12702.14s]  left shift. Okay, I got my sword. Okay, I'm ready. So, where do we go? That... I almost threw up
[12702.14s -> 12709.80s]  from that. I almost just fell down. Okay, I don't like how he moves out of his own.
[12709.80s -> 12733.48s]  How do I tell him to go? Go! Go! I need a saddle. What's going on with the world?
[12740.33s -> 12758.26s]  Oh, stop doing that. All right, do something! Can I... Will he go anywhere? Now you're
[12758.26s -> 12788.57s]  going to leave. You're a real... He's pointing at him. What happened to that guy? All right,
[12788.57s -> 12797.70s]  I need a saddle. Where's the crafting book? Saddle. How do I get him to come with me? Will
[12797.70s -> 12812.02s]  he come with me? Like, craft a lead and take him home. Oh, I need to find a saddle.
[12814.09s -> 12835.90s]  Oh, well, this was cool. At least I got to see it. Bye! Be free! Just spawn a saddle.
[12835.90s -> 12847.26s]  I... I don't... I... Pet the turtle. That was outrageous. Look, there's another one.
[12851.46s -> 12858.78s]  Well, that was cool. I gotta take a break. I gotta go get... I gotta go get a fucking drink.
[12859.74s -> 12867.40s]  That last 30 minutes kind of just killed me. I'm gonna grab a drink. I'll be right back.
[12867.96s -> 12874.74s]  Water. And I'm not even talking in the right direction. That's the rarest horse in the game.
[12875.30s -> 12882.38s]  At least I got to ride it. I got to ride it for at least a second. I got to put the coin
[12882.38s -> 12887.90s]  in in front of the fucking Walmart. All right, I'll be right back. We'll do another one.
