[3.19s -> 23.93s]  Yeah, we'll do Dread X. Alright, what are some must-play games in the Dread X Collection 1?
[23.93s -> 36.89s]  What is the must-play from Dread X 1? Oh my god, I can't even... Can I not even launch this game?
[36.89s -> 45.38s]  Okay, I think I have to go... This is weird. Alright, never mind. Weird. That was weird.
[45.38s -> 47.22s]  Everyone fears losing their mind.
[47.22s -> 56.10s]  Let me just make sure this is not too loud. Alright, so which one should we do?
[56.10s -> 61.32s]  There is Don't Go Out, Hand of Doom. We did that one a little bit.
[61.40s -> 71.35s]  Summer Night Outsiders, Rotgut, Pony Factory, Shatter. We did this one. I wasn't fair to this
[71.35s -> 102.34s]  one. I was annoyed at the internet. Do Rotgut, Pony Factory, Summer Night, Rotgut, Pony Factory.
[102.34s -> 117.43s]  Alright, we'll do Pony Factory. Let's go. Does it matter? I should do... Okay, that's fine.
[117.43s -> 129.19s]  That should be fine. I remember these old... No, it's not. I remember these. It used to be... Wait,
[129.19s -> 135.75s]  what happened? Anytime that popped up, it was always like, alright, we're in for a real one.
[139.06s -> 156.52s]  Wait, what? What? Really? Oh, shit. Alright, let's go. Duskdev made this. Oh, shit. Alright,
[156.52s -> 163.62s]  let's do it. Let's do it. Alright, so this is Lights Out, Begin Game. I'll turn the lights off.
[163.62s -> 194.50s]  Lights are going off. Sure. It's because of Mambians. Here we go. Winston arrived at a solution
[194.58s -> 200.15s]  to the moral decay of his town. He called out to Hel in a secret candlelit room one evening,
[200.15s -> 207.70s]  and Hel answered him. The human body could, Hel promised, be twisted, stretched, and broken into
[207.70s -> 216.02s]  a kinder, more... a queen shape? The human heart molded into something less human. Winston's town,
[216.02s -> 220.10s]  now filled with the cruel and the ignorant, could instead be filled with magic ponies,
[220.66s -> 225.13s]  if he could provide a factory in which to make them. Winston thought they could be beautiful,
[225.13s -> 246.73s]  gentle, and good. Yeah, Hel had other plans. I don't think so. No, no, no, no. Okay. WASD.
[247.53s -> 298.70s]  There's no sprint. Pick up. What is this? Oh, God. You actually have to shoot stuff? Locked.
[298.70s -> 333.90s]  Look for the unlocked door to complete each area. This is unlocked. Okay. Hold left mouse to fire
[333.90s -> 355.03s]  the bolt gun. Hard reload. Keep on the lookout for ammo pickups. I'm telling you, I'm the guy that
[355.03s -> 361.34s]  distracts people at the door. I distract people at the door. I'm the, you know, I'm the guy with
[361.34s -> 366.74s]  the glasses. The actor, you know, doesn't zoom in. It says the actor. And it's like a quick few cuts
[366.74s -> 370.94s]  of me doing things and like distracting people and doing like a magic trick behind them and stuff.
[370.94s -> 405.58s]  I'm not the person that comes in and does this. That was, those are very loud. The amount of
[405.58s -> 470.34s]  question marks. I don't think a lot of you guys were here earlier. I hear something running. I'm
[470.34s -> 493.94s]  at almost an ammo, man. What did that say? The game's loud. Um, hold on. Let me help you there.
[493.94s -> 515.03s]  I helped. Can you not see? What the fuck are you talking about? I just reloaded my gun.
[516.07s -> 558.68s]  That you were not in the hallway before. I have no ammo. I'm dead in one hit. That thing was not
[558.68s -> 573.86s]  here. See? Oh my God. I'm dead. Just kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Whatever. I got him with
[573.86s -> 645.42s]  every shot. Holy fuck. Okay. I need health right now. Oh my God. There's another enemy type
[647.51s -> 693.82s]  what is it doing? I think I'm in trouble here. One. Why are you guys saying one? One. Why is
[693.82s -> 705.24s]  every saying one? All right. I'm in a much better position than I was last time. I have 15 shots,
[705.24s -> 757.69s]  70 health. Here he comes. Okay. Thank God. Is that ammo? That's a lot of ammo, isn't it?
[757.69s -> 808.30s]  No, it's just tape. It's tape. Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm dead. Oh fuck. I'm dead. What do I do?
[808.86s -> 822.97s]  I have no way. I don't have enough ammo. I don't have enough ammo. I have 19 bullets.
[843.40s -> 850.33s]  I can't kill all these people. Oh fuck. All right. That was that was actually pretty scary.
[850.33s -> 856.70s]  That was fucked up. I can't beat it though. I saw you need to you need to be really in there
[856.70s -> 868.50s]  and you got to get in there and get use your eyes. Okay. That was terrifying. Let's do another one.
[868.50s -> 881.45s]  Which one? Summer night. People saying to play rock out. Some people said summer night too.
[881.45s -> 894.57s]  Somebody else said steam is back up. Let's do. Yeah, let's do rock up and then I'll
[894.65s -> 907.16s]  we'll do a few more of those steam games too. It's bright. Oh my goodness. This
[907.16s -> 924.41s]  looks like the old starting soon screen. Have you seen the trailer for the Morbius game?
[924.41s -> 933.24s]  Yeah, it looks fucking cool. You'll see a rock at the curve of Gano street when you do walk into
[933.24s -> 958.58s]  the woods. I was pissed when they said they were making it a card game though. What's going on?
[958.58s -> 962.66s]  It's like you you get other cards and you use those cards to level up the other cards.
[964.18s -> 978.82s]  I don't know. I'm not into it. And how are they going to have anybody actually give a shit about
[978.82s -> 984.95s]  that game? I mean, it's just all different versions of Morbius. There's no other Marvel
[984.95s -> 992.94s]  characters in it. It's like Morbius in a suit. Morbius in a tuxedo. Morbius in his beast form
[992.94s -> 998.15s]  and stuff. It's just like, why the way? I don't care. There's no other Marvel characters in the
[998.15s -> 1009.00s]  game. I don't know if they think that it can sell on its own, but I don't think it can.
[1009.00s -> 1014.01s]  All right, I need to find Gano street. Is this I mean, this looks like woods to me.
[1014.57s -> 1096.02s]  Are these the woods? Big bank. Okay. It's like an underground dance party. This guy is really high.
[1098.09s -> 1107.54s]  This guy is high as a kite. If that's the only move you're doing. Okay, so what's the deal?
[1108.26s -> 1134.31s]  Yeah, like I was sweaty. Really sweaty. Just keep going. It's just it's the freaking peanuts.
[1135.69s -> 1227.35s]  All the different Charlie Brown dances. Okay, what am I looking for? Look behind you. Nobody's
[1227.35s -> 1263.78s]  following me. Rock got rock got who said that? Did I say that that I said that this guy doesn't
[1263.78s -> 1328.76s]  is not very scared. Look behind you. It's a chair. Where's the light coming from? What? I'm here.
[1328.76s -> 1356.49s]  What is this for? Green mold cake time? Are these? Okay, these are not these are not butterflies.
[1356.49s -> 1391.10s]  These are asses. Okay, right. Those are asses. Of course, let's get this shit out of me. Why
[1391.10s -> 1401.14s]  would you ever come down here? Like, why would you ever do this? Would you ever come down here?
[1401.14s -> 1414.15s]  Okay, I would come down here. If all right, if we if there was like 50 of us, and 10 of them were
[1414.79s -> 1424.52s]  20 of them were professional bodybuilders, then yeah, I'm only coming down here with 50 people.
[1424.52s -> 1446.33s]  No, 100. You're a chicken. No, I'm only doing this if there's and I'm 10 people's too little,
[1446.33s -> 1452.34s]  10 people's too little 20 people's too little to for me to be comfortable being down here.
[1452.34s -> 1464.30s]  There needs to be three, four, five rows of people all walking down this way. Because I mean,
[1464.30s -> 1470.04s]  if there is a rot gut, he's a kind of a big scary guy, or like a monster or something.
[1470.04s -> 1474.36s]  You understand that if he starts grabbing and attacking somebody, 10 people are going to get
[1474.36s -> 1477.88s]  on top of him and like one of the bodybuilders is going to wrap around and like start choking him
[1477.88s -> 1483.56s]  out. Like grabbing him behind like this and fucking holding him like this. Like somebody
[1483.56s -> 1487.40s]  going to grab him and choke him. What the fuck was that? Was that the sus guy? What was that?
[1488.04s -> 1499.91s]  What the hell was that? Was that the sus fucking face? What was that? What I did, I like just caught
[1499.91s -> 1510.04s]  the end of that. What the fuck just happened? I just saw the sus face. And that was really weird
[1510.04s -> 1515.32s]  because I was like pretending to go like this and like, and I let go and I just started seeing
[1515.32s -> 1539.67s]  things. I'm like, wait, I didn't do that. It was it was some woman. Okay. But you know what I mean?
[1540.63s -> 1551.46s]  And we're all going to have various weapons, right? Like, like pipes, like tire iron,
[1551.46s -> 1573.06s]  regular clothes iron, and you're coming down here with 50 people. And and one person is going to be
[1573.06s -> 1579.05s]  the electronic specialist. They're going to have a backpack with like 10 cell phones with SIM cards
[1579.05s -> 1585.85s]  in them and shit. Like like a traveling like communications guy. We're going to we're going
[1585.85s -> 1591.61s]  to have this guy have a backpack with like 15 SIM cards in it to make sure we have a cell phone
[1591.61s -> 1601.18s]  signal. And that guy's right in the middle. We keep that guy directly in the middle. So no matter
[1601.18s -> 1610.28s]  what our electronic specialist can like reach the surface. I don't care if this guy's to walk around
[1610.28s -> 1618.01s]  with a huge antenna behind him going up almost touching the ceiling. I'm almost at the end.
[1626.12s -> 1633.26s]  It's gonna be horrible. I just scared myself. What is it? What is it? What is it? What's rotgut?
[1633.26s -> 1659.74s]  It's gonna blow up. You went the wrong way. No, I didn't. It's gonna be like,
[1678.73s -> 1695.48s]  what the fuck is happening? It's gonna scream. I'm just warning everybody. It's probably gonna
[1695.48s -> 1748.44s]  scream in your face. It's getting closer. It is. Oh shit. Get the fuck out of here. What about what's
[1748.44s -> 1791.02s]  going on? I'm getting outside. What the hell is going on? What was that? Game crashed. Rotgut.
[1791.02s -> 1818.36s]  What happened? What happened? My mouse? I can't look. My mouse is not even on the screen. I can't.
[1818.36s -> 1832.55s]  I have to like force quit the game. I can't get out of here. You just psyched yourself up.
[1833.37s -> 1842.07s]  I beat it. Okay. That's kind of cool. What else is on here? Oh, right. I was going to do the some
[1842.07s -> 1846.15s]  more of the steam stuff. All right. We'll do the one that everybody wanted me to play. That's
[1846.15s -> 1864.82s]  what is it called? The one I had just downloaded. Do Summer Night. Okay. We'll do Summer Night.
[1864.82s -> 1868.18s]  Absolutely nothing scary happens in this game. For best results, play in a dark room and wear
[1868.18s -> 1906.65s]  headphones. Use Alt F4 to leave. Well, that's full of shit. What? What's going on with the moon?
[1906.65s -> 1946.55s]  20 points. Yeah, I'm not smoking anything. What's this one called? This is called Summer Night.
[1946.55s -> 1952.01s]  The Dread X Collection number one. There's like five or six of these. I imagine eventually you'll
[1952.01s -> 1969.00s]  play them all. Or at least some of them. Or most of them. Whatever. Lovely night. Watch out. Watch
[1969.00s -> 1996.46s]  out for that guy. Watch out. Watch out. Don't touch the poop. Can I move it? Get out of the way. So
[1996.46s -> 2013.75s]  what? Just some weird guy comes and like shits on your lawn? Monkey business. Get out of the way.
[2013.75s -> 2036.38s]  Get out of the way. They're blocking the way. Warm breeze. This thing is going to scream in my
[2036.38s -> 2041.72s]  face. I'm telling you. I already know. I know it's gonna scream in my face. It's gonna be like
[2042.68s -> 2100.94s]  I'm waiting for it to scream. See? It just did. I got it. I got it. Funny fungus. Hey, stop. Don't
[2100.94s -> 2132.12s]  even. That is something. I heard a sound. What was that? Can you hear that? Meet me in the park. Can
[2132.12s -> 2155.42s]  you guys hear it? Is it too low? I can't turn it up. I don't think. It's like a turn it up. Can't. I
[2155.42s -> 2163.18s]  can't hold on. Next transition. I'll do it. It's gonna hopefully it's not too loud. Don't stop
[2163.18s -> 2183.21s]  hitting me. If I if I try to get if I alt-tab it's gonna close the whole thing out. All right. Let
[2183.21s -> 2196.23s]  me try. Come on. Come on. Come on. Can you see? I got it. Nice. It said time flies. You're gonna.
[2196.23s -> 2203.02s]  Okay. Yeah. Here's the thing. Didn't work. Didn't fucking work. You know why? Because there's no
[2203.02s -> 2249.21s]  door over there. Now if that came from over here I would go. Yeah. What's going on with the moon?
[2249.21s -> 2280.06s]  Come on. What is that thing? I'm telling you. I'm only doing things with like 50 people. You know
[2280.06s -> 2283.82s]  what I mean? I'm like anytime I go anywhere it's gonna be a hundred people. We're all gonna like be
[2283.82s -> 2328.50s]  ready. That's not scary. There's just like a rat in the attic. Nice try. Is there on my webcam?
[2328.50s -> 2366.22s]  Ah. That's. I didn't even. I've been holding right here this whole time. The battery is going.
[2368.33s -> 2375.43s]  My itchy face. The battery's gonna go to zero and some hands gonna come over and grab and pull and
[2375.43s -> 2397.43s]  it's gonna scream at me. Error. Okay. I don't know what it is but like I feel like a lot of older
[2397.43s -> 2403.43s]  people jumpscares like don't work. I'm gonna pretend to be like a fucking 70 year old.
[2415.93s -> 2442.25s]  Whoa. What was that? Holy smokes. Oh he's an ugly one. I tried to punch. I'm trying to put.
[2442.25s -> 2487.91s]  Somebody's breathing. How am I supposed to go over there? Why would you punch? I'm telling you. I'm
[2487.91s -> 2495.21s]  doing. I'm doing a triple crowhop. Like crowhop. Crowhop. Crowhop. Punch as fucking hard as I can.
[2495.21s -> 2502.33s]  Directly square here. As hard as I possibly can and try to take that fucking head off.

[2509.00s -> 2535.93s]  Like the monster. Not the game. What the fuck? Are you kidding me? I knew it was gonna be something
[2535.93s -> 2569.62s]  weird. Dude how come there ain't 50 people in this house? Huh? Give me the batteries. I did it.
[2569.62s -> 2593.62s]  Those batteries were huge. That was creepy. That was creepy. That was a good one. By the way,
[2593.62s -> 2599.69s]  monster is in my house. I don't fucking. I don't care. I mean that fridge is coming down.

[2624.86s -> 2634.20s]  boom. You monster. You fucking big scary motherfucker. You're getting a frying pan here.

[2683.43s -> 2688.47s]  Cartoon style. Crush this into this person's. Into this whatever. This is monster's head.
[2689.19s -> 2697.10s]  The vacuum cleaner. Oh my god. I'm holding the vacuum cleaner the other way.
[2697.90s -> 2703.42s]  Like a joke weapon from fucking Dead Rising. And this is. I'm baseball swinging the vacuum
[2703.42s -> 2707.50s]  into their head. I'm telling you what would happen. I'm telling you what would happen.

[2726.58s -> 2732.81s]  I'm running up and I'm going to fucking just right in the middle. What a terrible position
[2732.81s -> 2743.45s]  for you to be in. They're getting the people's elbow. Or vacuum cleaner. Just get it ready.
[2743.45s -> 2761.61s]  Up. Down. You would get eaten. There's no way I'm getting eaten. What happened to my webcam?
[2763.00s -> 2766.12s]  No. There's no way I'm getting eaten. Oh you think I'm going to get eaten?
[2766.76s -> 2770.76s]  Into the freezer. All the frozen food is coming out. And I'm taking it out of the
[2770.76s -> 2775.32s]  package and throwing it out. I'm going in the fridge. All the raw meat is just like
[2775.32s -> 2783.74s]  getting thrown out in front. Every piece of food that I have. It's going to be like meat.
[2783.74s -> 2788.70s]  It's going to go for it. And that's when you go fucking. Right. Oh my God. That was probably
[2788.70s -> 2817.16s]  so loud. How sweaty I am. Was that loud? Okay. Okay. Thank God. Dude. Just keep like big boots up
[2818.20s -> 2827.24s]  in your bedroom. You hear like. I've come to get your soul. Whatever. Right. Oh. Oh. Those

[2832.52s -> 2842.98s]  if I'm naked. I'm going to be in huge boots. And I'm just going to fucking. I'm going to get my soul.
[2844.01s -> 2850.09s]  I'm going to get my. You're going to be trying to eat me. And by the way they're going to be
[2850.09s -> 2864.49s]  two sizes too big. Two sizes too big. What am I talking about? I'm talking about if a monster
[2864.49s -> 2886.38s]  were to. Horror movie style be in my house. Normal shoes. What if it was a dinosaur?
[2891.02s -> 2897.26s]  What are you talking about? A dinosaur is an old animal. Why would it be a. If it's a dinosaur
[2897.26s -> 2907.03s]  then. Okay. Then that's a. I guess I'm dead. Oh no. No. I would. No. What I would do.
[2907.83s -> 2913.11s]  Excuse me. I would take the standing lamp that's in the living room. I would take.
[2914.31s -> 2919.91s]  Unscrew the light out of the standing lamp. Take the lampshade off and have a javelin and just throw
[2919.91s -> 2950.25s]  it. Like right into the fucking dinosaur's heart. You know what I mean? Like. Do you really think
[2950.25s -> 2963.67s]  you are special enough for a monster to come after you? I don't know. He's going off the record.
[2964.23s -> 2976.60s]  What do you mean off the record? No. If a dinosaur came to the house. I would just go out. I would
[2976.60s -> 2981.24s]  just go. I would. I would meet the dinosaur outside. And I would go like this. Be huge. I'm
[2981.24s -> 2985.99s]  much. I'm huge. I'm much bigger than you. Like this. My arms would be in the air. And I'd be
[2985.99s -> 3007.83s]  going like this. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. It would work. Imagine what. I'm just
