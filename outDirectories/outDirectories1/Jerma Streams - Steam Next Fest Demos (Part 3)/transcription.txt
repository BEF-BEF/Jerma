[16.25s -> 20.97s]  Let me just very briefly go over this because a lot of people are going to be very unhappy.
[21.93s -> 30.39s]  I know I usually don't say anything for at least a minute or two, but I'm here right- I'm here immediately.
[33.21s -> 36.25s]  All right, have I even start saying this?
[37.62s -> 40.34s]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm very, very
[41.54s -> 44.90s]  not happy to announce that there will be no BLT eating on this stream.
[45.62s -> 47.45s]  Uh, I know what's up.
[54.34s -> 58.73s]  We have lettuce and tomato chunks.
[59.37s -> 63.91s]  I didn't go get any bacon or anything, and we have hot dog buns.
[64.55s -> 67.53s]  I was thinking about like, okay, can I like fake this?
[68.09s -> 71.45s]  Can I go- can I take a hot dog bun, just put mayo in it,
[71.45s -> 74.65s]  lettuce, and some tomato chunks, and let's pretend there's bacon in it,
[74.65s -> 77.21s]  and take a couple bites and be like, whoa, BLT!
[78.25s -> 81.77s]  But then people- you guys would tell me to prove I'm eating a BLT.
[82.81s -> 88.81s]  So I'd have to show it to the camera and really examine it to a point where there's no way
[89.45s -> 92.17s]  it's a BLT, so sorry about that.
[92.73s -> 97.24s]  Anyways, I'll eat a BLT like at some point.
[97.24s -> 98.04s]  Who cares?
[98.60s -> 100.84s]  I was laughing about this before starting because it's just like,
[103.11s -> 105.99s]  oh, hey, sorry guys, I'm not eating the BLT on stream today.
[105.99s -> 113.10s]  It's like, I- that's a- that's a sentence that is hard to understand as a real sentence.
[113.10s -> 116.14s]  You know what I mean?
[120.06s -> 121.98s]  More broken promises, it's alright.
[123.50s -> 127.42s]  Hey, speaking of broken promises, those of you- excuse me,
[128.58s -> 130.18s]  we're playing Sorcery today.
[132.36s -> 133.72s]  Sorcery is today.
[134.98s -> 139.94s]  So, broken promises, excuse me, didn't watch the Smurfs- the Smurfs movie, no.
[142.15s -> 142.71s]  No.
[142.71s -> 143.51s]  I've been pretty busy.
[144.15s -> 147.19s]  I haven't had- haven't had time to watch the Smurfs movie.
[149.24s -> 150.76s]  I'll watch the Smurfs movie.
[153.77s -> 156.33s]  No BLT is worse than no Sorcery.
[157.72s -> 158.52s]  What?
[158.52s -> 161.56s]  Yeah, sorry, I'm like 15 minutes late.
[162.52s -> 164.52s]  Well, I mean, it's gonna happen, whatever.
[166.20s -> 167.32s]  Stomach is being annoying.
[168.04s -> 169.93s]  Don't have to get into it, but it is.
[170.65s -> 172.30s]  As a new job, it is great.
[174.84s -> 176.36s]  I'm on a couple of projects right now.
[177.08s -> 179.56s]  You'll probably see them- I don't want to give you a time
[180.36s -> 182.76s]  because as it stood, when I joined the company,
[184.14s -> 185.82s]  they were kind of already in the middle of a few things
[185.82s -> 188.38s]  and I wasn't really a part of the process on them.
[189.24s -> 193.88s]  But later on, a lot of the stuff you'll see in the middle of this year
[193.88s -> 198.36s]  and into, you know, you know, the content plan into, you know,
[198.36s -> 202.55s]  next quarter or two, I'm on a couple of things
[202.55s -> 205.83s]  and I'm really, really excited for you to see them, especially one of them.
[206.47s -> 211.83s]  Oh, excitement, Andy.
[211.83s -> 214.15s]  You owe us 110 gifted subs.
[214.15s -> 223.83s]  Yeah, it's a lot- I'm happy- I'm really happy so far.
[224.55s -> 227.27s]  And I think I'm getting a pretty good idea of the workflow.
[227.83s -> 229.43s]  Because a couple weeks ago when this was announced,
[229.75s -> 233.43s]  it was almost like how- what's the strategy to do this?
[234.55s -> 236.31s]  So I can, you know, I want to stream still,
[236.31s -> 238.23s]  I want to do this still, I want to do writing,
[238.23s -> 239.83s]  I want to do, you know, get into meetings,
[239.83s -> 243.59s]  get into meetings, you know, executive meetings,
[243.59s -> 246.23s]  you know, executive meetings, you know, executive meetings,
[246.23s -> 248.71s]  you know, executive meetings, you know, executive meetings,
[248.71s -> 251.19s]  you know, executive meetings, you know, executive meetings
[251.19s -> 251.83s]  and all that stuff.
[252.63s -> 256.55s]  Are you all right?
[256.55s -> 258.71s]  I just sat down weird.
[265.08s -> 268.44s]  I sat down weird and kind of did my voice get weird,
[268.44s -> 269.72s]  kind of sounded a little weird for a second.
[275.77s -> 276.81s]  Executive Andy.
[276.81s -> 279.45s]  Now, I think I've got a good idea of how it's going to work.
[282.01s -> 284.57s]  Yeah, I like it a lot.
[284.57s -> 286.89s]  It's real- I think I'm contributing.
[289.56s -> 291.48s]  You know, my role in the company,
[291.48s -> 294.04s]  and contrary to some of the popular belief here,
[294.04s -> 297.32s]  is not to just show up at the office
[298.28s -> 302.84s]  and see how far I can slide down the hallway with socks on.
[303.64s -> 306.52s]  And that's- everyone just kind of looks out their office
[306.52s -> 307.48s]  and be like, oh, what's he doing?
[307.48s -> 308.20s]  Okay.
[308.20s -> 309.16s]  Chief Creative Officer.
[311.05s -> 311.61s]  So, you know.
[317.59s -> 317.99s]  All right.
[317.99s -> 320.31s]  Today, we're going to play Steam NextVest Games.
[320.95s -> 323.62s]  I was supposed to do this a long time ago,
[324.18s -> 325.43s]  but I'm glad it's back.
[327.99s -> 329.35s]  And then Sorcery.
[329.35s -> 331.19s]  So I downloaded a bunch of these games already.
[331.75s -> 334.74s]  Because last time I did this, I kind of scrolled
[334.74s -> 337.22s]  and then installed and had to install them live.
[337.22s -> 342.87s]  And I just got like 15 to 16 of them
[343.43s -> 344.55s]  that looked interesting to me.
[345.66s -> 346.38s]  And we're just going to go.
[347.02s -> 350.36s]  It's on the docket.
[351.56s -> 352.36s]  That's a good question.
[352.36s -> 354.92s]  First, I'm just going to pick a random one.
[355.48s -> 357.75s]  Because I don't want to say what I have.
[357.75s -> 360.23s]  And then people say, no, no, no, dude, just play that only.
[360.79s -> 371.13s]  So let's do- I mean, how long is the Lies of P demo?
[371.13s -> 372.49s]  Because I want to play it.
[372.49s -> 373.13s]  I just want to see.
[373.85s -> 375.13s]  Is it long or should I-
[375.85s -> 379.18s]  We've got to give it like 10 to 20 minutes to each of these.
[379.18s -> 379.98s]  It's like 30 minutes.
[380.78s -> 381.74s]  Like three hours.
[382.46s -> 383.11s]  No way.
[385.02s -> 385.74s]  Like 20 minutes.
[386.79s -> 387.75s]  Five hours?
[389.59s -> 390.15s]  What?
[390.15s -> 390.39s]  All right.
[390.39s -> 391.51s]  Well, let me just check it out.
[391.51s -> 393.67s]  We're going to jump around every 10, 20 minutes or so.
[394.23s -> 395.11s]  I just want to get a taste.
[395.75s -> 398.76s]  So let's do it now.
[398.76s -> 399.00s]  Okay.
[400.18s -> 401.38s]  Yeah, we'll do this for a couple of hours.
[401.38s -> 402.10s]  Maybe two, three hours.
[402.10s -> 403.46s]  And then we'll move to sorcery.
[403.46s -> 404.42s]  Going to be chill today.
[405.70s -> 406.34s]  No cam.
[406.34s -> 407.94s]  So okay.
[407.94s -> 409.22s]  Everybody that's annoyed about that.
[409.22s -> 409.46s]  Sorry.
[413.11s -> 414.79s]  Shaders are compiling, really.
[421.37s -> 423.85s]  Do you lick your fingers after eating Doritos?
[423.85s -> 424.09s]  No.
[425.11s -> 425.99s]  Well, hold on.
[426.55s -> 427.99s]  Let me tell the truth.
[428.63s -> 432.63s]  Anytime I eat something like Takis or Doritos or Cheetos,
[432.63s -> 433.35s]  doesn't matter what it is.
[433.99s -> 437.75s]  If it leaves a residue on your fingers is what I do.
[438.71s -> 440.95s]  I go with the one single lick on the thumb.
[442.17s -> 443.69s]  Just one single lick.
[445.93s -> 447.13s]  And then I wash my hands.
[447.69s -> 452.25s]  All right.
[452.25s -> 452.57s]  Let me-
[453.50s -> 458.20s]  You guys can't see this, but now you can.
[459.00s -> 462.57s]  And you hear it though is a better question.
[462.57s -> 463.05s]  Now you can.
[463.61s -> 464.23s]  All right.
[464.23s -> 465.03s]  I got a controller.
[465.03s -> 466.15s]  So it's a controller game, right?
[466.71s -> 470.94s]  Do up to the first boss.
[471.83s -> 472.79s]  Let's see.
[472.79s -> 475.91s]  Because I don't want to spend like three hours in one demo.
[476.84s -> 477.32s]  Check it out.
[477.32s -> 479.24s]  The next best demos.
[479.80s -> 482.20s]  I'm going to play Lies of P for four hours
[482.20s -> 483.72s]  and then not even play sorcery.
[485.77s -> 487.29s]  This is my word.
[487.29s -> 487.85s]  Is it right here?
[491.66s -> 491.90s]  Warning.
[491.90s -> 496.49s]  This icon will appear when the game is saving.
[496.49s -> 497.13s]  Yeah.
[497.13s -> 499.69s]  The functions and text in the demo version of Lies of P that you-
[500.33s -> 503.62s]  How's the audio?
[503.62s -> 504.34s]  Should I turn it up?
[504.34s -> 508.02s]  Or it could be a little louder.
[508.02s -> 513.53s]  And use a license agreement.
[513.53s -> 514.33s]  Oh, shit.
[514.81s -> 515.93s]  I got to agree to this.
[523.14s -> 523.94s]  Let's go.
[523.94s -> 532.12s]  Is it loud now?
[532.12s -> 532.84s]  You didn't read it?
[533.48s -> 534.12s]  I did.
[534.12s -> 535.27s]  You just couldn't see.
[539.00s -> 539.88s]  Now Lying.
[539.88s -> 540.84s]  This is a good game for me.
[544.66s -> 547.70s]  In honor of the great writer, Carlo Colodi.
[554.62s -> 555.50s]  I can't actually.
[555.50s -> 556.86s]  I did not hear that if anybody talked.
[557.42s -> 563.13s]  Was I supposed to hear that?
[564.49s -> 565.21s]  I can't hear this.
[566.41s -> 573.94s]  It's a lie?
[573.94s -> 574.66s]  No, it actually isn't.
[574.66s -> 575.70s]  I didn't hear any of that.
[575.70s -> 576.02s]  Why?
[578.89s -> 579.85s]  My audios.
[579.85s -> 580.49s]  Oh no, sorry.
[580.49s -> 581.21s]  I didn't have this plugged in.
[582.34s -> 582.90s]  All right, cool.
[584.22s -> 585.34s]  Move, rotate camera.
[587.27s -> 588.07s]  Now I can hear.
[588.07s -> 588.31s]  Good.
[589.21s -> 589.61s]  Liar.
[591.05s -> 594.70s]  Okay.
[594.70s -> 596.60s]  So what was this game?
[596.60s -> 598.84s]  What would you guys compare this to?
[598.84s -> 601.64s]  Does this game have like a certain comparison of a certain franchise?
[601.64s -> 605.16s]  Or a certain like style of games that I would potentially like?
[610.07s -> 610.47s]  Jiminy.
[612.23s -> 613.50s]  Okay.
[618.28s -> 619.40s]  Kind of looks like Tetris.
[622.63s -> 624.87s]  Jiminy, please escort him to the hotel.
[626.07s -> 627.27s]  This is Jiminy?
[628.92s -> 629.64s]  Do not be afraid.
[629.64s -> 633.00s]  Even if you get lost in the fog, the cricket guide will be with you.
[633.00s -> 641.66s]  Okay.
[641.66s -> 645.90s]  Okay, cool.
[645.90s -> 646.30s]  Vod.
[646.30s -> 646.94s]  Hi chat.
[646.94s -> 650.14s]  Hey, can we please get everybody take a quick second, please.
[650.14s -> 651.58s]  And say hello to the Vod Watchers.
[651.58s -> 652.22s]  We don't.
[652.22s -> 654.95s]  I think they feel a little left out.
[654.95s -> 655.67s]  Don't you think so?
[657.94s -> 659.70s]  Everybody on the count of three say.
[659.70s -> 660.98s]  Hey, Vod Watchers.
[660.98s -> 661.78s]  Enjoy the show.
[665.50s -> 666.46s]  Hey, Vod Watchers.
[667.02s -> 667.90s]  Enjoy the show.
[669.22s -> 672.34s]  Now I'm going to put on a bunch of DMCA music so they can't hear anything for the rest of
[672.34s -> 676.41s]  the entire fucking stream.
[676.41s -> 677.93s]  I'm just kidding, Vod Watchers.
[677.93s -> 678.41s]  Stay here.
[678.97s -> 685.14s]  Can I move faster than this?
[685.14s -> 687.54s]  But the streets are not safe.
[689.00s -> 691.80s]  Arm yourself with one of the weapons over there.
[691.80s -> 695.72s]  Somebody said, is he, somebody said this a while ago, but they said, is he sober?
[696.44s -> 699.40s]  And it stuck with me because I was like, why did you say that?
[703.64s -> 704.44s]  Combat style.
[707.03s -> 707.51s]  Balance.
[708.23s -> 708.95s]  Dexterity.
[709.96s -> 710.68s]  Strength.
[710.68s -> 712.52s]  Path of the Cricket.
[712.52s -> 720.38s]  The Bastard or the Sweeper.
[720.38s -> 725.75s]  Oh, it's going to, it's, I imagine it's going to be just like the other souls like games.
[725.75s -> 727.74s]  This doesn't really necessarily matter that much.
[728.30s -> 730.14s]  And this doesn't, it doesn't matter at all because it's a demo.
[730.14s -> 731.18s]  So I'm just going to go with this one.
[734.26s -> 743.83s]  All right.
[743.83s -> 744.31s]  Dodge roll.
[744.31s -> 744.79s]  Feels good.
[745.35s -> 746.76s]  Okay.
[746.76s -> 747.48s]  Can you two hand?
[756.23s -> 758.55s]  Was a lawnmower inside of my ears.
[759.98s -> 760.86s]  Centrist Andy.
[761.58s -> 766.14s]  Rat central station.
[766.14s -> 766.70s]  Rainy night.
[772.26s -> 773.06s]  Special attack.
[773.06s -> 774.50s]  Hold down to do a charge attack.
[774.50s -> 774.66s]  Yeah.
[776.26s -> 779.05s]  Okay.
[780.73s -> 781.77s]  It is a little, I'm going to turn it down.
[781.77s -> 782.57s]  It is a little loud.
[788.62s -> 789.90s]  You're going to die to the first enemy.
[790.62s -> 792.86s]  I play these games a lot.
[793.50s -> 794.94s]  I'm not going to die to the first enemy.
[804.90s -> 812.65s]  Uh, let's get it to like, uh, that's all right.
[812.65s -> 813.13s]  Is that better?
[813.69s -> 815.56s]  That's better.
[818.17s -> 820.57s]  I am so glad I just turned it down right there.
[834.95s -> 837.50s]  The maximum number of pulse cells.
[837.50s -> 839.02s]  Use a pulse cell to recover HP.
[839.02s -> 843.58s]  There is a maximum number of times pulse cells can be used just like all the other games
[844.06s -> 846.30s]  that are in this category.
[846.30s -> 847.77s]  Okay.
[847.77s -> 849.61s]  If you attack enemies while the cell is discharged,
[849.61s -> 851.29s]  pulse cell will be gradually charged.
[851.29s -> 851.53s]  Okay.
[851.53s -> 853.22s]  So let's go.
[853.86s -> 864.52s]  We're checking out steam next best.
[868.73s -> 872.17s]  I'm not playing sorcery and I'm not playing another single other game today.
[872.97s -> 884.58s]  Because there's no way I'm going to get through this in 10 minutes.
[884.58s -> 885.86s]  It's already been 10 minutes.
[886.50s -> 901.11s]  Light up your, who is that?
[901.11s -> 901.35s]  Okay.
[901.35s -> 903.03s]  That's, is that Jiminy talking?
[903.83s -> 907.03s]  I mean, it's not dark in here.
[909.13s -> 909.93s]  Lies of Jay.
[915.21s -> 915.53s]  Yep.
[915.77s -> 916.41s]  Okay.
[916.41s -> 921.45s]  I feel like lies of P is going to be some really major consequences of the lies of P.
[923.42s -> 927.74s]  Lies of Jay is like, I was going to eat a BLT today and I didn't.
[928.30s -> 929.16s]  Okay.
[929.96s -> 939.54s]  Like, whoa, what happened?
[939.54s -> 946.94s]  Bright bumper behind, right?
[947.58s -> 959.83s]  Oh, it has, there's an indicator.
[959.83s -> 960.31s]  Hold on.
[961.69s -> 968.06s]  Ah, lie.
[968.06s -> 970.86s]  Like you said, you're going to play the great ace attorney Chronicles.
[970.86s -> 971.18s]  Sad.
[976.25s -> 977.29s]  Well, I didn't lie.
[978.09s -> 979.21s]  I just didn't do it.
[983.64s -> 984.60s]  Fable catalyst.
[985.16s -> 986.15s]  Okay.
[986.15s -> 987.83s]  Activate upper belt slot, lower belt slot.
[987.83s -> 988.95s]  I think I figured this out already.
[988.95s -> 989.27s]  I did.
[990.58s -> 991.86s]  That is lying.
[991.86s -> 994.57s]  Isn't there, okay.
[994.57s -> 997.21s]  But isn't there like intent when it comes to lying?
[997.21s -> 1001.77s]  Like if I tell you, oh man, I really, really, I really, I want to go on that.
[1001.77s -> 1004.17s]  Uh, I want to go on that water slide.
[1004.17s -> 1007.40s]  Oh, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to try to go on that water slide on Thursday.
[1007.40s -> 1008.12s]  Okay.
[1008.12s -> 1011.32s]  If I don't go on the water slide on Thursday, isn't that just me expressing the thing that
[1011.32s -> 1013.80s]  I would like to do or thing I want to do?
[1014.87s -> 1019.13s]  Doesn't a lie technically have to have some kind of intent behind it?
[1019.13s -> 1021.69s]  Like I am not telling you I'm going to go on the water slide.
[1021.69s -> 1024.09s]  So you like just to make it up.
[1024.09s -> 1027.14s]  Is that, don't you need to have like intent when it comes to lying?
[1027.94s -> 1035.77s]  It was like, oh man, I've, I love, I love water slides.
[1036.33s -> 1039.91s]  But then if I don't go to the water park, am I a liar?
[1042.12s -> 1044.04s]  Just me liking water slides no longer.
[1044.04s -> 1045.32s]  Am I not allowed to say that anymore?
[1054.98s -> 1056.10s]  False equivalency.
[1059.53s -> 1059.77s]  Okay.
[1059.77s -> 1066.09s]  To me, to me, a lie of real live would be if somebody said, Hey dude, do you want to
[1066.09s -> 1067.85s]  go to the water park today?
[1067.85s -> 1074.39s]  And I said, no, no, I, uh, I'm getting nighted today.
[1075.11s -> 1075.51s]  Sorry.
[1076.54s -> 1077.26s]  Oh, really?
[1077.26s -> 1077.58s]  Yeah.
[1077.58s -> 1079.40s]  I'm getting nighted today.
[1079.40s -> 1080.76s]  Oh, weird.
[1080.76s -> 1081.00s]  All right.
[1081.00s -> 1084.97s]  We'll hit us up next week.
[1084.97s -> 1085.93s]  That's like a lie.
[1087.34s -> 1088.94s]  Is an actor a professional liar?
[1089.58s -> 1090.30s]  Interesting question.
[1095.53s -> 1100.81s]  Me, me expressing desires and things that I would like to do and want to do is not, I
[1100.81s -> 1101.85s]  mean, is that a lie?
[1101.85s -> 1105.29s]  If you don't actually do the thing that you say you like to do or want to do.
[1106.17s -> 1106.89s]  Yeah.
[1106.89s -> 1110.25s]  I said, I want to go camping the fucking three years ago and I didn't go camping.
[1110.97s -> 1112.70s]  Is that a lie?
[1112.70s -> 1115.26s]  Or is it like, I just didn't fucking want to do, I just didn't want to go camping.
[1115.90s -> 1120.28s]  All right.
[1120.28s -> 1121.32s]  This is a harder enemy.
[1128.73s -> 1129.29s]  Okay.
[1129.29s -> 1133.48s]  Just, I'm going to die to the first real enemy of the game.
[1134.12s -> 1135.29s]  Is there a parry?
[1136.01s -> 1142.30s]  All right.
[1142.30s -> 1144.06s]  This guy feels harder than everybody else.
[1150.50s -> 1152.10s]  Can I, I want to parry this guy.
[1152.10s -> 1153.86s]  He usually would be right here, but what does this do?
[1153.86s -> 1154.98s]  Left arm of steel.
[1154.98s -> 1155.46s]  What is that?
[1163.38s -> 1164.10s]  I'm dead.
[1164.10s -> 1164.74s]  I'm dead here.
[1165.30s -> 1172.54s]  Why does this guy have so much more health and shit?
[1172.54s -> 1172.78s]  Okay.
[1172.78s -> 1174.30s]  Every enemy has died in three hits.
[1175.02s -> 1177.26s]  This guy is like impossible.
[1177.26s -> 1184.28s]  Who the fuck is this guy in the tutorial that is unkillable?
[1192.95s -> 1193.51s]  Tap.
[1193.51s -> 1195.19s]  What does the left arm even do?
[1195.19s -> 1195.75s]  Oh, okay.
[1195.75s -> 1196.71s]  Thanks for telling me.
[1196.71s -> 1197.35s]  Video game.
[1198.33s -> 1201.21s]  Guard against, defend against enemy attacks by guarding.
[1201.93s -> 1203.93s]  If your guard is successful, it will reduce the,
[1203.93s -> 1206.86s]  they wait for you to die before they tell you there's a block.
[1206.86s -> 1209.74s]  It will reduce the damage, but will cause stamina
[1209.74s -> 1212.78s]  and the damage will be transferred to guard regain.
[1213.90s -> 1215.70s]  Okay.
[1215.70s -> 1219.14s]  Guard regain will be turned into HP recovery if you attack enemies.
[1219.14s -> 1223.82s]  Guard regain accumulates, but gradually reduces after a certain time has passed.
[1224.38s -> 1226.26s]  If your guard is successful.
[1226.26s -> 1226.34s]  Okay.
[1226.34s -> 1227.38s]  So it's just a block.
[1227.38s -> 1230.79s]  Is it, can, is it like a, all right, let's go.
[1231.67s -> 1238.14s]  Okay.
[1238.14s -> 1239.34s]  Well, whatever.
[1239.34s -> 1240.60s]  Just don't get hit.
[1249.91s -> 1250.31s]  Okay.
[1250.31s -> 1251.27s]  Sawtooth wheel.
[1254.97s -> 1256.49s]  We're at the 20 minute mark.
[1256.49s -> 1257.61s]  I think it's time to move to a new game.
[1266.18s -> 1267.94s]  Let me, let me beat this guy though.
[1267.94s -> 1279.34s]  This game's like two to three hours for the demo.
[1279.34s -> 1279.84s]  Yeah.
[1282.25s -> 1282.81s]  Run a poll.
[1287.13s -> 1294.25s]  Um, we want a time extension poll.
[1295.05s -> 1299.96s]  Let me get, let me get past this first enemy.
[1300.52s -> 1309.10s]  How do I, it was already on.
[1310.79s -> 1313.35s]  So it's, you have to go up and down and then scroll.
[1313.35s -> 1313.99s]  Okay. I get it.
[1322.71s -> 1324.31s]  Let me at least get to the first area.
[1324.31s -> 1325.43s]  Like, let me beat this first guy.
[1335.18s -> 1336.62s]  They just lost a customer.
[1339.88s -> 1341.16s]  Wait, you mean for the game?
[1341.88s -> 1342.38s]  What?
[1345.93s -> 1348.33s]  Are you talking about me or are you talking about you saying that?
[1355.12s -> 1357.60s]  Yeah, I'm not, this is, this is fun.
[1357.60s -> 1358.80s]  No, I'm, I didn't say that.
[1361.21s -> 1362.65s]  They just lost a customer.
[1363.29s -> 1371.95s]  Press the button.
[1380.99s -> 1382.51s]  This is, that's a shortcut.
[1382.51s -> 1383.79s]  I didn't even look over here.
[1383.79s -> 1384.35s]  God damn it.
[1386.35s -> 1387.15s]  I was worried.
[1387.15s -> 1388.59s]  Right behind me was the shortcut.
[1388.59s -> 1389.39s]  Really?
[1389.39s -> 1389.89s]  All right.
[1390.83s -> 1392.48s]  All right, let's go.
[1393.04s -> 1415.18s]  Are you even supposed to kill this guy?
[1415.74s -> 1442.81s]  Okay. I'm not, this has Sekiro like block parries?
[1443.53s -> 1444.03s]  Like this?
[1448.04s -> 1457.93s]  I don't, was that person lying?
[1458.73s -> 1460.56s]  This enemy is groggy?
[1465.98s -> 1466.30s]  All right.
[1466.30s -> 1468.94s]  There's other systems in this game that I do not know exist.
[1469.90s -> 1470.86s]  Groggy?
[1470.86s -> 1472.06s]  What does groggy mean?
[1472.06s -> 1473.02s]  Groggy Gary.
[1473.66s -> 1479.08s]  Okay. Well, that was pretty sloppy, but whatever.
[1486.22s -> 1487.18s]  That was a fun spin.
[1487.18s -> 1489.88s]  You know, it means stagger.
[1495.98s -> 1499.72s]  Did I actually even have to do that?
[1500.28s -> 1513.50s]  Okay. Well, I'm going back up here.
[1525.58s -> 1528.64s]  Wait, did I get, did it pick anything up?
[1528.64s -> 1529.36s]  What did that guy have?
[1529.92s -> 1532.17s]  Did he have anything on him?
[1532.17s -> 1542.17s]  Should we extend the time for lies of P?
[1542.89s -> 1544.88s]  Oh, not extended, but hold on.
[1544.88s -> 1546.32s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1546.32s -> 1549.37s]  I'm, I'm not done with it yet.
[1549.37s -> 1560.84s]  Sorry, I'm lying.
[1564.65s -> 1565.85s]  He's lying.
[1565.85s -> 1578.17s]  Am I missing something or?
[1578.17s -> 1581.21s]  And okay, seems correct.
[1581.85s -> 1588.38s]  Is this a case where I killed that guy,
[1588.38s -> 1590.62s]  looked at chat and missed the item that the guy dropped?
[1590.62s -> 1593.64s]  Is that, is that what happened?
[1600.73s -> 1603.05s]  Yes. Oh, okay.
[1603.05s -> 1612.91s]  Good. Okay.
[1615.18s -> 1615.58s]  Crat.
[1619.07s -> 1620.91s]  Crat central station, rainy night.
[1621.98s -> 1623.34s]  Prepare the stargazer.
[1627.55s -> 1628.91s]  At least get to the first boss.
[1630.38s -> 1632.14s]  Yeah. I can't leave the demo without.
[1632.14s -> 1633.98s]  Don't worry. We got plenty of time.
[1633.98s -> 1636.14s]  I'm not in a time limit.
[1636.14s -> 1641.36s]  All right. So this is a bonfire clearly.
[1644.92s -> 1646.60s]  It runs really well, plays really well.
[1648.12s -> 1648.60s]  I'm into it.
[1661.08s -> 1662.52s]  The lies just keep adding up.
[1665.08s -> 1665.96s]  What did this person say?
[1665.96s -> 1666.60s]  This is kind of funny.
[1667.80s -> 1669.96s]  They said you are on a time limit, dude.
[1669.96s -> 1671.88s]  Like not, nobody lives forever or something.
[1671.88s -> 1673.72s]  Like this technically is a time limit.
[1673.72s -> 1674.28s]  Clever one.
[1675.24s -> 1677.40s]  This stargazer will make you stronger,
[1679.08s -> 1683.24s]  but the stargazer strength doesn't last forever.
[1683.24s -> 1683.80s]  It's true.
[1683.80s -> 1684.92s]  So be careful with it.
[1685.88s -> 1686.20s]  Yeah.
[1686.20s -> 1688.52s]  Hurry up and come to hotel Crat.
[1689.32s -> 1693.63s]  Okay. Level up.
[1697.26s -> 1700.62s]  So this is HP guard regain.
[1700.62s -> 1704.27s]  So it is like Sekiro with a guard system.
[1704.99s -> 1709.18s]  Just go all stamina capacity.
[1711.47s -> 1713.47s]  Motivity technique.
[1713.47s -> 1713.71s]  All right.
[1713.71s -> 1715.55s]  Which one of these is strength index?
[1716.27s -> 1719.08s]  This one looks like strength index.
[1720.20s -> 1725.08s]  I'm just play this game forever.
[1725.80s -> 1728.20s]  Hey, we, you hate this game and we all know it.
[1728.20s -> 1728.76s]  Hey, listen.
[1730.54s -> 1731.26s]  God damn it.
[1732.40s -> 1736.00s]  No, I, I'm doing health and I'm doing this.
[1740.08s -> 1741.52s]  Yeah. What's about this projection?
[1744.60s -> 1745.80s]  Okay. Perfect guard.
[1747.71s -> 1748.43s]  Right before getting hit.
[1748.43s -> 1749.79s]  So this, this is a parry, I'm assuming.
[1750.43s -> 1765.42s]  Is that good?
[1765.42s -> 1766.06s]  Did I do it?
[1766.62s -> 1775.08s]  So what's the benefit of actually doing a perfect parry?
[1775.08s -> 1776.52s]  It doesn't seem to stagger them or anything.
[1777.24s -> 1779.00s]  They don't have their own bar like Sekiro.
[1785.82s -> 1787.18s]  Do you like this game?
[1787.82s -> 1793.93s]  I bet you at least 70% of people say yes.
[1794.65s -> 1796.81s]  It builds stagger and you take no damage.
[1804.60s -> 1806.20s]  What am I fighting right now?
[1806.20s -> 1806.84s]  Is this oil?
[1816.60s -> 1817.24s]  This oil.
[1817.88s -> 1824.25s]  All right.
[1824.25s -> 1825.21s]  Well, hold on a second here.
[1825.21s -> 1826.89s]  You've got me in two different directions.
[1826.89s -> 1829.37s]  People are saying this is like, kind of like Bloodborne.
[1829.37s -> 1831.77s]  But then people say in Sekiro, they play very differently.
[1831.77s -> 1832.97s]  I'm a dodge Andy.
[1833.53s -> 1835.77s]  Bloodborne was all about dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[1835.77s -> 1837.85s]  Sekiro is parry, parry, parry, parry, parry.
[1837.85s -> 1838.41s]  Which one is it?
[1838.41s -> 1838.97s]  I don't know.
[1838.97s -> 1839.61s]  It's interesting.
[1849.50s -> 1850.38s]  I frame Andy.
[1850.94s -> 1854.14s]  It's a mix of the two.
[1855.77s -> 1859.13s]  Okay. Well, now I'm, I'm a lot more interested now
[1859.85s -> 1862.33s]  because Bloodborne is one of my favorite games of all time.
[1863.05s -> 1865.21s]  And I despise Sekiro.
[1865.29s -> 1868.65s]  So, I mean, this is going to be a very interesting game for me.
[1880.68s -> 1882.60s]  I don't despise Sekiro.
[1882.60s -> 1884.28s]  I just don't like it at all.
[1892.59s -> 1894.43s]  Pratt times issue 183.
[1895.15s -> 1898.04s]  No, it would be perfect.
[1898.84s -> 1904.00s]  Is if I somehow get a mechanism to have like a fake nose.
[1906.67s -> 1907.71s]  I haven't even said it.
[1907.71s -> 1908.51s]  It makes me laugh.
[1908.51s -> 1908.91s]  Whatever.
[1909.87s -> 1912.51s]  Have a fake nose and just say a bunch of lies on stream
[1912.51s -> 1914.11s]  and just keep growing every time.
[1915.07s -> 1928.96s]  Nevermind, plus two.
[1928.96s -> 1930.40s]  Yeah, you got to give me a chance.
[1930.40s -> 1936.92s]  You can't just, some of you guys really jump to conclusions.
[1936.92s -> 1937.48s]  Jump the gun.
[1938.28s -> 1939.85s]  You got to wait for the whole thing.
[1942.68s -> 1944.84s]  Okay. Um, it's just you.
[1953.82s -> 1955.42s]  Dim ergo fragment.
[1956.06s -> 1968.72s]  Will he switch before the horse race is over?
[1969.36s -> 1970.24s]  What a horse race.
[1971.04s -> 1981.85s]  Is a horse race?
[1982.65s -> 1997.98s]  I like it.
[1999.31s -> 2000.11s]  Fable arts.
[2000.75s -> 2004.67s]  Use blade fable arts while guarding use handle fable arts.
[2005.23s -> 2009.08s]  Weapons have distinct blades and handles that each have their own fable art.
[2009.08s -> 2012.92s]  Fable arts use a fable slots and fable, different fable arts
[2012.92s -> 2015.16s]  use a different fable number of slots.
[2015.72s -> 2017.16s]  Charge fable slots by attack.
[2017.16s -> 2017.48s]  All right.
[2017.48s -> 2023.95s]  So I just used all of it and the big scary enemies running down the hallway now.
[2024.67s -> 2037.84s]  That's not perfect.
[2037.84s -> 2039.34s]  I'm surprised.
[2039.34s -> 2048.99s]  All right.
[2048.99s -> 2050.27s]  Hold for a charge attack.
[2051.47s -> 2054.11s]  So if they get groggy, I can probably kill them pretty quickly like that.
[2056.76s -> 2057.56s]  Oh, you guys.
[2060.36s -> 2062.04s]  You picked the turtle.
[2062.04s -> 2063.64s]  The turtle will never be the horses.
[2063.64s -> 2065.00s]  The horses are much faster.
[2065.88s -> 2068.12s]  They have more muscular definition than the turtle.
[2068.92s -> 2077.28s]  There's no way the turtle will win.
[2078.08s -> 2082.83s]  Now watch.
[2082.83s -> 2085.07s]  I'm going to sprint as fast as I can then run out of energy.
[2085.87s -> 2101.53s]  So what does this one do?
[2103.53s -> 2105.93s]  Oh, does that make attack power more?
[2106.81s -> 2107.93s]  That's what the rabbit said, German.
[2107.93s -> 2122.86s]  Look what happened to him when he raced the turtle grinder.
[2124.06s -> 2125.18s]  Use the what is it?
[2125.82s -> 2126.89s]  All right.
[2126.89s -> 2127.21s]  Hold on.
[2127.77s -> 2128.09s]  Wait, wait.
[2128.09s -> 2128.73s]  I don't want to die here.
[2128.73s -> 2139.96s]  This is actually just do use the grinder.
[2139.96s -> 2140.44s]  This thing.
[2141.16s -> 2146.36s]  Hold on a second.
[2152.00s -> 2155.68s]  Oh, you have to grind the weapon for durability.
[2156.48s -> 2159.36s]  Okay.
[2159.36s -> 2162.20s]  Did the turtle win?
[2164.06s -> 2173.24s]  Oh, my goodness.
[2173.24s -> 2176.04s]  You know how horrible that's going to be when you fight a boss in this game?
[2176.04s -> 2181.00s]  It's a hard boss and the boss needs like three hits and you have to grind your weapon.
[2182.20s -> 2183.48s]  That's going to be so sad.
[2183.48s -> 2185.56s]  I know it's going to happen at least a half dozen times.
[2186.44s -> 2206.88s]  Hey, anything to make it so you can't just press B to dodge everything, right?
[2211.60s -> 2212.80s]  He hates democracy.
[2213.44s -> 2215.08s]  I'm almost done.
[2215.08s -> 2216.28s]  This was one of the big ones.
[2216.28s -> 2217.08s]  This was one of the big ones.
[2217.08s -> 2218.04s]  I really wanted to try this.
[2218.68s -> 2223.34s]  This is very obviously like one of the big ones of the next best.
[2224.06s -> 2234.00s]  This is a okay.
[2234.00s -> 2234.72s]  Cool.
[2234.72s -> 2240.19s]  Let me just get eyes on where this is because this is a shortcut.
[2242.27s -> 2243.07s]  Let him vibe.
[2243.07s -> 2243.39s]  Damn it.
[2243.39s -> 2244.11s]  Yeah, let me vibe.
[2244.11s -> 2244.75s]  I'm just vibing.
[2245.31s -> 2253.84s]  Let me get eyes on this because I okay.
[2263.48s -> 2269.82s]  I'm just trying to figure out how to where the shortcut actually is going to.
[2270.46s -> 2273.29s]  You don't know what vibe means.
[2274.76s -> 2275.24s]  Not really.
[2280.99s -> 2281.95s]  I am going to do this though.
[2283.84s -> 2284.88s]  I'm imagining.
[2284.88s -> 2285.60s]  Yep.
[2285.60s -> 2287.04s]  These are definitely crunchies, right?
[2288.19s -> 2288.75s]  Yes, they are.
[2301.20s -> 2301.76s]  Technique.
[2303.76s -> 2304.40s]  Advance.
[2306.62s -> 2312.06s]  It's just stamina and that's good.
[2314.94s -> 2315.98s]  I think this is dexterity.
[2315.98s -> 2318.62s]  This might be strength, although it's hard to tell.
[2319.58s -> 2321.90s]  I think this is strength.
[2322.54s -> 2325.87s]  All right.
[2327.07s -> 2328.03s]  I'm absolutely good.
[2328.03s -> 2328.67s]  I'm going to run.
[2328.67s -> 2330.35s]  I kind of forget where I'm going, but it's all right.
[2331.15s -> 2334.46s]  Where was it?
[2334.46s -> 2337.10s]  It was this way up here.
[2337.82s -> 2339.85s]  This way, right?
[2342.54s -> 2344.06s]  Oh, that was so completely wrong.
[2344.78s -> 2352.19s]  Where did I even come from?
[2352.75s -> 2356.16s]  Down here?
[2358.40s -> 2359.44s]  No, no, it was up this way.
[2364.12s -> 2365.32s]  The entire.
[2365.32s -> 2365.64s]  Okay.
[2366.44s -> 2370.54s]  I should just reset it this way, right?
[2371.18s -> 2372.75s]  Okay.
[2372.75s -> 2373.63s]  Yeah, let me reset it.
[2374.27s -> 2384.91s]  This is going to be a 24 hour stream at this rate, dude.
[2384.91s -> 2385.47s]  It's not.
[2385.47s -> 2386.35s]  It's going to be fine.
[2387.15s -> 2393.76s]  I need to get to the first boss of the demo.
[2394.40s -> 2399.66s]  There's going to be a boss that you beat.
[2399.66s -> 2402.54s]  And then it says, thank you so much.
[2403.42s -> 2404.14s]  Next player.
[2404.78s -> 2406.73s]  Thank you for playing the demo.
[2417.34s -> 2418.62s]  Is this guy just trying to punch me in the face?
[2424.22s -> 2424.54s]  Really?
[2425.50s -> 2429.12s]  This is the first boss.
[2429.12s -> 2430.16s]  First boss, first boss.
[2430.16s -> 2430.88s]  All right.
[2431.28s -> 2433.28s]  This really wants to teach me how to do this.
[2434.08s -> 2454.49s]  Okay.
[2454.49s -> 2455.85s]  I think I'm understanding it.
[2456.49s -> 2459.69s]  The red one is easier for me for some reason.
[2459.69s -> 2460.25s]  I don't know why.
[2464.11s -> 2464.43s]  All right.
[2465.07s -> 2467.31s]  Cool.
[2467.31s -> 2468.35s]  Hello there.
[2468.35s -> 2469.95s]  Welcome to Krot, visitor.
[2470.84s -> 2471.16s]  Hi.
[2471.16s -> 2474.12s]  I didn't think there were any stalkers left to fight the puppets.
[2475.40s -> 2476.04s]  You didn't hear?
[2477.16s -> 2477.64s]  Figures.
[2478.36s -> 2480.68s]  The whole organization fell apart.
[2481.40s -> 2485.56s]  All that's left are wannabes and amateurs who think they can fight on their own.
[2487.40s -> 2490.04s]  R1, R1, R1, R1, can you?
[2492.04s -> 2497.92s]  You can't buy something.
[2497.92s -> 2498.24s]  Okay.
[2499.95s -> 2500.83s]  Rowing cell.
[2502.70s -> 2505.34s]  Electric blitz damage at the area of impact.
[2510.67s -> 2512.91s]  Electric blitz aggressive.
[2513.71s -> 2517.95s]  I mean, this is, these are different weapons and everything.
[2519.90s -> 2520.46s]  Cool.
[2520.46s -> 2521.42s]  Looks pretty cool.
[2521.42s -> 2526.16s]  But I'm in demo mode and I'm just trying to get to the end of the demo.
[2526.80s -> 2531.71s]  Philip, let's go.
[2532.35s -> 2532.75s]  All right.
[2532.75s -> 2535.23s]  Now what happens if you have two turtles though?
[2535.23s -> 2536.59s]  Mods make it happen.
[2537.23s -> 2540.19s]  I want to, I want to race with two turtles.
[2542.46s -> 2543.42s]  Which one will win?
[2545.47s -> 2545.71s]  All right.
[2545.71s -> 2546.11s]  Here we go.
[2546.67s -> 2548.51s]  Time to prove that I know how to play video games again.
[2549.31s -> 2551.39s]  This might be loud, so be aware of that.
[2552.19s -> 2571.21s]  Jesus.
[2573.63s -> 2573.95s]  Okay.
[2577.69s -> 2578.81s]  Parade master.
[2579.45s -> 2597.90s]  Let's go.
[2613.44s -> 2614.96s]  Somebody learned how to play the game.
[2615.60s -> 2618.25s]  Everybody in chat is seething right now.
[2618.97s -> 2629.44s]  Shit, that hurt.
[2635.28s -> 2636.08s]  Groggy attack.
[2636.88s -> 2641.61s]  Do the swing.
[2641.61s -> 2642.01s]  Swing.
[2642.01s -> 2642.65s]  Do the big swing.
[2642.65s -> 2643.53s]  How do I do the swing?
[2643.53s -> 2643.77s]  What?
[2644.33s -> 2645.45s]  I thought it was Y.
[2645.45s -> 2646.65s]  It's not Y?
[2646.65s -> 2647.45s]  I pressed Y.
[2651.13s -> 2651.77s]  What is that?
[2651.77s -> 2652.41s]  Oh my God.
[2653.21s -> 2658.43s]  All right.
[2658.43s -> 2660.03s]  Your moveset just got way weirder.
[2660.67s -> 2689.66s]  What the fuck?
[2690.30s -> 2692.54s]  I didn't block it.
[2702.86s -> 2704.06s]  What does L2 do?
[2704.78s -> 2710.01s]  I'm in trouble.
[2710.73s -> 2718.68s]  I don't even know what L2 does.
[2720.65s -> 2722.01s]  Advisor sidearm.
[2722.01s -> 2732.03s]  I swear to God, if it tells me what L2 does when I revive, I'm gonna be very upset.
[2740.36s -> 2741.48s]  You die in a boss battle.
[2741.48s -> 2743.32s]  Death ergo is created at the entrance.
[2744.28s -> 2745.96s]  That's actually really awesome.
[2753.02s -> 2756.38s]  That's such an unbelievably good change for these games.
[2759.04s -> 2761.12s]  It's outside the boss door.
[2761.76s -> 2765.92s]  So if you don't feel like if you go in there and you lose a shitload of souls.
[2768.12s -> 2769.48s]  I'm going the wrong way.
[2769.48s -> 2770.60s]  I'm going the wrong way.
[2772.49s -> 2774.33s]  Glad to see this is still a thing.
[2776.38s -> 2778.78s]  Oh my God.
[2778.78s -> 2779.58s]  What the fuck?
[2799.85s -> 2800.97s]  What did they all even come from?
[2804.12s -> 2804.44s]  All right.
[2805.08s -> 2805.64s]  Here we go.
[2806.12s -> 2807.64s]  I'm going to go beat this demo boss.
[2809.16s -> 2809.72s]  Don't worry.
[2809.72s -> 2812.04s]  I'm not just going to play one demo.
[2817.20s -> 2817.52s]  Cool.
[2817.52s -> 2818.24s]  Okay.
[2818.24s -> 2819.92s]  That's actually really cool.
[2826.56s -> 2830.56s]  I really like the sort of quality of life differences.
[2833.95s -> 2835.31s]  I don't have anything.
[2835.31s -> 2835.87s]  Whatever.
[2835.87s -> 2836.59s]  It's the demo.
[2836.59s -> 2837.31s]  I don't care.
[2838.19s -> 2849.52s]  This is going to hit an hour before we change.
[2849.52s -> 2850.16s]  That's all right.
[2850.16s -> 2850.88s]  I'll add time.
[2851.52s -> 2866.01s]  I have to beat the parade master.
[2866.73s -> 2883.24s]  Ow.
[2883.80s -> 2889.20s]  I'm already.
[2889.84s -> 2891.20s]  I already fucked the whole thing up.
[2892.00s -> 2898.67s]  I did so much better on the first try.
[2899.47s -> 2907.87s]  Oh, come on.
[2907.87s -> 2908.19s]  Really?
[2910.97s -> 2922.24s]  I already have all.
[2922.24s -> 2922.88s]  Dude, I got him.
[2923.52s -> 2926.62s]  I wish I could just hold like right bumper and just reset.
[2927.34s -> 2928.73s]  Just kill me.
[2929.37s -> 2939.53s]  I got to retry.
[2940.25s -> 2946.84s]  This took me five tries.
[2946.84s -> 2948.36s]  I don't even count that one.
[2948.92s -> 2953.21s]  Why'd you give up?
[2953.21s -> 2956.86s]  Because I had zero heals and he's not even at 10% health.
[2956.86s -> 2960.25s]  If I get him down to 10% health and I lose,
[2960.65s -> 2962.09s]  that'd be very sad.
[2965.79s -> 2967.07s]  Okay, throwing objects.
[2967.07s -> 2968.67s]  I want to know what LT does.
[2969.63s -> 2972.36s]  Like, what does this do?
[2973.08s -> 2974.65s]  It's like a super punch.
[2976.14s -> 2977.02s]  I don't know.
[2977.02s -> 2981.34s]  Go read the guide.
[2981.98s -> 2982.92s]  Where's the guide?
[2983.56s -> 2988.72s]  How do I get to the guide?
[2989.36s -> 2994.49s]  You'll get different abilities later.
[2995.37s -> 2997.04s]  It's a super punch right now.
[3000.30s -> 3001.90s]  I'm going to try this two more times.
[3001.90s -> 3003.42s]  And even if I lose, it doesn't matter.
[3003.42s -> 3004.78s]  I'm moving on to the next demo.
[3004.78s -> 3007.34s]  This was a cool, good first look at lies of P.
[3007.34s -> 3010.81s]  We're moving on after two more attempts.
[3020.60s -> 3021.48s]  Two times.
[3021.48s -> 3022.20s]  Don't lie.
[3030.65s -> 3031.37s]  Okay, let's go.
[3032.17s -> 3036.32s]  Okay, I have to dodge backwards, not to the left.
[3037.28s -> 3038.56s]  Because they hit me with that every time.
[3058.20s -> 3067.04s]  I feel like I'm not even hurting this guy.
[3067.92s -> 3082.56s]  Oh, come on.
[3091.08s -> 3093.56s]  I will say, the second that I'm allowed to change weapons,
[3093.56s -> 3094.60s]  I'm going to immediately.
[3095.40s -> 3118.96s]  All right, groggy.
[3118.96s -> 3119.36s]  Let's go.
[3120.00s -> 3149.90s]  Whoa, what the fuck is he doing?
[3149.90s -> 3151.10s]  Oh, I didn't get the groggy.
[3151.98s -> 3164.78s]  Do it.
[3166.60s -> 3167.10s]  Yes.
[3187.47s -> 3196.22s]  Oh, God, that double crow hop is annoying.
[3212.14s -> 3214.14s]  Whoa, I thought I dodged it.
[3214.14s -> 3215.02s]  Oh, my God.
[3215.02s -> 3215.66s]  He's going to kill me.
[3215.66s -> 3216.06s]  No, he's not.
[3216.06s -> 3216.56s]  I'm fine.
[3257.32s -> 3257.82s]  Damn it.
[3263.07s -> 3265.74s]  This game is fucking hard.
[3265.74s -> 3267.00s]  God damn it.
[3267.00s -> 3271.42s]  L plus Y is parry.
[3271.42s -> 3274.09s]  Huh?
[3274.09s -> 3275.13s]  All right, one more time.
[3275.13s -> 3275.63s]  That's it.
[3283.02s -> 3284.46s]  I don't think that's a parry.
[3284.46s -> 3285.34s]  I think that's like a buff.
[3285.90s -> 3293.69s]  Does it say?
[3294.25s -> 3296.04s]  I don't think it says anything about it.
[3300.12s -> 3300.92s]  Over leveled.
[3301.56s -> 3303.32s]  What am I doing?
[3303.32s -> 3305.64s]  I've had a chance to level one time.
[3306.68s -> 3308.92s]  All right, time that person up for at least 10 minutes.
[3313.23s -> 3314.75s]  All right, last attempt before I move on.
[3314.75s -> 3317.31s]  I'm not sitting here for two hours playing lies of P.
[3317.31s -> 3317.81s]  Okay.
[3318.43s -> 3333.44s]  I got so close.
[3333.44s -> 3336.00s]  All right, I'm going to use patience and I'm going to go for it.
[3336.96s -> 3337.46s]  Let's go.
[3338.08s -> 3354.59s]  Need stamina.
[3355.39s -> 3373.04s]  Oh, that wasn't a perfect.
[3373.04s -> 3398.08s]  I feel like you got to be really close to hit them.
[3398.80s -> 3401.15s]  I think it's just I don't like the weapon.
[3401.79s -> 3426.25s]  He's still not, is he groggy anymore?
[3426.25s -> 3427.21s]  Oh, that's sad.
[3431.64s -> 3432.52s]  Horrible place to be.
[3460.72s -> 3474.43s]  I didn't dodge it.
[3485.84s -> 3487.60s]  My brain is conflicted playing this game.
[3489.12s -> 3490.08s]  I'm playing secure.
[3490.08s -> 3507.26s]  But then I'm like, no dodge on.
[3509.96s -> 3510.76s]  Oh, my God.
[3510.76s -> 3511.24s]  I'm dead.
[3511.24s -> 3512.68s]  All right, we're playing next game.
[3512.68s -> 3517.46s]  Let's kill me.
[3518.16s -> 3526.19s]  All right, last one.
[3526.19s -> 3526.59s]  One more.
[3526.59s -> 3527.23s]  That's it.
[3527.23s -> 3542.65s]  So should I be going more secure or more blood born?
[3543.21s -> 3547.04s]  I feel like my brain is trying to say play secure.
[3547.04s -> 3550.00s]  And then in a different move is like play blood born instead.
[3555.20s -> 3557.12s]  You should play it more secure.
[3557.12s -> 3558.00s]  More secure, secure.
[3558.00s -> 3562.22s]  OK, so I should be trying to parry everything.
[3564.30s -> 3565.98s]  Not like you like this.
[3568.30s -> 3580.49s]  OK, this is the one right here.
[3580.49s -> 3580.99s]  Guaranteed.
[3641.68s -> 3643.20s]  Holy shit, that did a lot of damage.
[3643.84s -> 3654.36s]  He broke my sword.
[3659.66s -> 3660.38s]  What the fuck?
[3662.09s -> 3663.93s]  Oh, my God, dude.
[3664.49s -> 3666.17s]  He's got so many different moves.
[3667.05s -> 3685.90s]  What?
[3685.90s -> 3711.74s]  Let's go groggy Gary.
[3713.58s -> 3714.62s]  All right, good.
[3714.62s -> 3717.02s]  I beat the tutorial boss one of probably five.
[3717.74s -> 3720.51s]  That's fun.
[3724.19s -> 3725.07s]  I like it.
[3725.07s -> 3726.68s]  I think it's very fun.
[3729.72s -> 3730.76s]  Dodge less.
[3730.76s -> 3731.24s]  Well, what?
[3731.24s -> 3732.04s]  OK, that's what I mean.
[3732.04s -> 3734.44s]  Like I was saying, my brain is trying to play secure.
[3734.44s -> 3738.36s]  But my brain is also like you need to dodge left every attack.
[3739.88s -> 3743.87s]  Now that it's like, OK, more more secure style.
[3744.67s -> 3746.75s]  Try to go for those perfect parries.
[3748.19s -> 3748.83s]  Pretty sick.
[3749.39s -> 3750.67s]  Dodge more, not less.
[3750.67s -> 3751.07s]  Wait, what?
[3754.81s -> 3755.45s]  Wrong info.
[3756.41s -> 3757.05s]  All right, that's fun.
[3757.69s -> 3762.78s]  I just want to see what's up here.
[3762.78s -> 3768.97s]  And that's it.
[3768.97s -> 3769.45s]  Next game.
[3769.45s -> 3770.25s]  I know, I just want to see.
[3770.25s -> 3771.77s]  I just want to see what's over here.
[3776.78s -> 3778.46s]  Look, there's like a notice that I need to look at.
[3779.10s -> 3782.24s]  All right, I'm going to sprint to the next boss.
[3785.98s -> 3786.78s]  My L2 does.
[3802.54s -> 3804.46s]  All right, I don't know what I just did.
[3805.10s -> 3813.98s]  They told me to be the lie.
[3813.98s -> 3815.02s]  I said I was a human.
[3815.02s -> 3815.66s]  That's a lie.
[3820.36s -> 3821.80s]  All right, OK, all right, all right.
[3821.80s -> 3823.96s]  I'm going to get like obsessed with this game.
[3823.96s -> 3824.28s]  I'm done.
[3824.92s -> 3829.29s]  We're going to move on to House Flipper 2.
[3830.01s -> 3832.16s]  Perfect opportunity to change.
[3832.16s -> 3839.15s]  Look, I'm into it.
[3839.15s -> 3840.59s]  When does it come out?
[3840.59s -> 3845.55s]  Does it release soon?
[3845.55s -> 3846.75s]  Like September, right?
[3846.75s -> 3850.91s]  I'm into it.
[3850.91s -> 3863.28s]  Let's just see what happens in this cutscene.
[3864.00s -> 3870.17s]  I know I've spent like 45 minutes playing this game, but don't worry.
[3870.17s -> 3870.73s]  We're going to be fine.
[3872.09s -> 3876.08s]  We're going to play Sorcery.
[3876.08s -> 3876.64s]  We're going to play.
[3878.64s -> 3879.52s]  House Flipper 2.
[3884.40s -> 3885.36s]  That's prune.
[3885.36s -> 3886.40s]  I'll use my power.
[3890.51s -> 3890.91s]  You can't.
[3891.63s -> 3892.43s]  All right, goodbye.
[3893.15s -> 3894.76s]  That was a good one.
[3894.76s -> 3900.48s]  All right, the next one we're going to do House Flipper 2.
[3905.56s -> 3906.92s]  This looks really fun.
[3907.56s -> 3915.44s]  Those of you that don't know, House Flipper is one of my number one games on stream.
[3918.14s -> 3921.18s]  I have streamed House Flipper more than any other game, I think.
[3921.18s -> 3924.30s]  Besides, maybe if you combine all the From Software games.
[3924.30s -> 3928.36s]  So let's give it a try.
[3928.36s -> 3937.26s]  And you should see it in one.
[3939.45s -> 3944.40s]  So what did they add in House Flipper 2?
[3946.20s -> 3950.17s]  I wonder how long the stream is going to be.
[3950.17s -> 3966.65s]  I don't know, maybe like six hours.
[3966.65s -> 3967.29s]  Oh, shit.
[3967.29s -> 3969.05s]  Okay, my capture is messed up.
[3969.05s -> 3969.69s]  Hold on.
[3969.69s -> 3972.04s]  I need to go to the settings here.
[3976.12s -> 3977.80s]  You can probably hear the music, though.
[3977.80s -> 3978.44s]  It's very nice.
[3979.47s -> 3980.91s]  I didn't even tweet that I was streaming.
[3980.91s -> 3981.31s]  Hold on.
[3984.89s -> 3992.99s]  There we go.
[3992.99s -> 3993.63s]  Screen's black.
[3993.63s -> 3994.03s]  Yeah, I know.
[3994.59s -> 4000.94s]  I'm just getting this situated.
[4002.22s -> 4002.62s]  I didn't.
[4002.62s -> 4003.90s]  I got to tweet, man.
[4003.90s -> 4008.06s]  Okay, that's fine.
[4013.56s -> 4014.36s]  Okay, let's go.
[4018.16s -> 4018.56s]  Settings.
[4018.56s -> 4019.04s]  Here we go.
[4020.12s -> 4020.68s]  Graphics.
[4021.24s -> 4031.40s]  Okay, you should be able to see it now.
[4031.40s -> 4034.35s]  Please yell at me if you can't.
[4034.99s -> 4037.20s]  Yeah, why does it look like that?
[4048.73s -> 4049.93s]  Okay, does that work?
[4049.93s -> 4054.68s]  Hey, there we go.
[4054.68s -> 4055.32s]  All right.
[4055.32s -> 4056.88s]  I'm ready.
[4056.88s -> 4058.84s]  New game.
[4058.84s -> 4066.01s]  I hope there's cleaning.
[4066.01s -> 4068.83s]  I hope there's mopping.
[4068.83s -> 4070.35s]  I hope there's clean the windows.
[4070.35s -> 4072.67s]  I have a wish list for House Flipper 2.
[4072.67s -> 4078.51s]  You're about to play the House Flipper 2 demo.
[4078.51s -> 4083.23s]  Follow the quest list to transform a rundown shack into a beautiful house.
[4083.87s -> 4086.94s]  When you're done, you can keep playing and add some personal touches to it.
[4087.76s -> 4089.12s]  Look up for books placed around the house.
[4089.12s -> 4090.64s]  They'll tell you how to use your tools.
[4090.64s -> 4090.88s]  Okay.
[4091.52s -> 4103.16s]  Is there a problem with the reception on the island?
[4103.96s -> 4104.60s]  I just tried to.
[4104.60s -> 4105.88s]  I have to leave a message then.
[4105.88s -> 4108.46s]  Oh, my dearest friend.
[4108.46s -> 4109.02s]  I buttoned them.
[4109.02s -> 4112.46s]  You may be wondering where you got here.
[4112.46s -> 4113.26s]  Don't worry.
[4113.26s -> 4114.62s]  I'm here to explain.
[4114.62s -> 4117.90s]  You said you want to try your handed house flipping, right?
[4117.90s -> 4121.02s]  I found a perfect house for you to work on.
[4121.02s -> 4121.98s]  You can throw now.
[4121.98s -> 4123.42s]  And not to waste any time.
[4123.42s -> 4128.06s]  I took the liberty of organizing your transport and everything else.
[4128.30s -> 4129.42s]  You're welcome.
[4129.42s -> 4132.78s]  So there's nothing more to do but to get to work.
[4132.78s -> 4133.58s]  Do your best.
[4134.14s -> 4137.10s]  I hope to turn a large profit selling this house.
[4137.10s -> 4139.82s]  Who wouldn't like to live in such a wonderful neighborhood?
[4139.82s -> 4141.82s]  Take care and happy flipping.
[4143.26s -> 4143.66s]  Thanks.
[4144.62s -> 4145.61s]  Get to work.
[4146.41s -> 4149.23s]  Flipper tool collecting trash.
[4149.95s -> 4152.17s]  What do I do with the trash?
[4152.81s -> 4156.83s]  Flipper sense.
[4157.55s -> 4159.77s]  Okay.
[4161.74s -> 4162.14s]  Tasks.
[4163.92s -> 4164.56s]  Stains.
[4164.56s -> 4165.28s]  Trash.
[4165.28s -> 4165.84s]  Okay.
[4165.84s -> 4173.07s]  What do I do with it?
[4178.88s -> 4179.68s]  Open?
[4179.68s -> 4180.88s]  Wait, I can open the trash?
[4181.68s -> 4183.95s]  All right.
[4183.95s -> 4186.83s]  So in the first game, it just disappears.
[4186.83s -> 4189.15s]  Do I actually have to clean it up and move it?
[4189.79s -> 4190.11s]  Let's see.
[4190.11s -> 4190.67s]  What does it say?
[4193.61s -> 4197.85s]  Paint sticks to a wall on its own, but you can't say the same for panels, wallpaper, or tiles.
[4197.85s -> 4199.77s]  Lay down some surface glue first.
[4199.77s -> 4204.44s]  Okay.
[4204.44s -> 4206.52s]  Left mouse to apply glue anywhere you want.
[4206.52s -> 4207.80s]  Don't want to go over the line.
[4207.80s -> 4209.72s]  Set the area for your glue first.
[4209.72s -> 4210.76s]  Actually, let's go back.
[4210.76s -> 4212.04s]  There's a couple of books I didn't look at.
[4215.02s -> 4215.90s]  This feels like it's not.
[4215.90s -> 4217.58s]  I got to make the FOV bigger.
[4228.80s -> 4230.00s]  I don't think I can do it.
[4230.00s -> 4230.88s]  It'll be in the...
[4230.88s -> 4232.24s]  It'll be in the full game, I imagine.
[4238.08s -> 4238.40s]  Okay.
[4238.96s -> 4244.38s]  Collect all the trash in your range with the most durable trash bags known to man.
[4244.38s -> 4245.98s]  Choose the collecting trash tool.
[4246.54s -> 4248.86s]  Find some garbage and press left click.
[4248.86s -> 4251.28s]  It's gone from the ground, but your job is far from over.
[4252.00s -> 4254.16s]  When the bag fills up, throw it in the bin.
[4255.79s -> 4259.39s]  So they went more like viscera clean-up detail style,
[4260.44s -> 4265.28s]  where I actually have to carry this around and put trash in it.
[4265.28s -> 4266.08s]  But where's the bin?
[4266.88s -> 4268.04s]  Is this a bin?
[4276.94s -> 4278.78s]  Okay, I'm collecting trash right now.
[4279.50s -> 4280.51s]  Okay.
[4289.66s -> 4291.69s]  Okay.
[4292.41s -> 4301.48s]  How much can I carry?
[4310.84s -> 4313.88s]  Okay, that's way more involved than it used to be.
[4314.68s -> 4323.52s]  Clean.
[4323.52s -> 4330.35s]  So are the leaves and stuff considered trash?
[4331.16s -> 4344.17s]  I can't pick this up anymore, right?
[4344.17s -> 4344.89s]  Yep.
[4344.89s -> 4351.13s]  Okay, close the bag.
[4352.25s -> 4353.84s]  Toss it.
[4353.84s -> 4357.74s]  Ooh, is there a map?
[4357.74s -> 4370.41s]  Before I do anything, do you know what I'm saying?
[4370.41s -> 4373.13s]  Like I remember this from the first game and I'm not fucking around.
[4373.13s -> 4383.13s]  How do I swing it?
[4383.13s -> 4394.80s]  Okay, I don't think I can swing.
[4395.52s -> 4402.54s]  Okay, we're good.
[4406.83s -> 4407.07s]  Q?
[4407.07s -> 4409.31s]  I think Q just changes how hard you're going to swing at it.
[4409.31s -> 4413.12s]  Isn't there usually a map too?
[4413.68s -> 4436.51s]  So how come this is not considered trash right here?
[4436.51s -> 4437.39s]  This is not trash?
[4437.39s -> 4439.15s]  This thing is fucking gross.
[4439.15s -> 4443.28s]  What do I do with it?
[4443.28s -> 4448.20s]  Is the bag full?
[4448.20s -> 4451.71s]  Can I wash this in the sink?
[4451.71s -> 4452.43s]  Bag's not full.
[4454.38s -> 4455.34s]  Now the bag is full.
[4457.93s -> 4458.89s]  I really actually like the...
[4459.61s -> 4476.16s]  Because you can have multiple trash bags.
[4476.16s -> 4477.28s]  All this has to go.
[4477.28s -> 4492.76s]  What is this one?
[4492.76s -> 4493.80s]  Okay, hold on.
[4493.80s -> 4500.67s]  Okay, this still stains.
[4501.39s -> 4502.19s]  Sell everything.
[4502.59s -> 4511.82s]  Um, hold on.
[4511.82s -> 4517.20s]  Broken glass?
[4517.20s -> 4518.24s]  I can't pick it up.
[4518.24s -> 4519.04s]  Maybe there's a vacuum?
[4521.68s -> 4523.44s]  All the trash is going out here for now.
[4523.44s -> 4530.88s]  All right, I'm pressing R.
[4530.88s -> 4532.46s]  I don't...
[4532.46s -> 4533.74s]  It doesn't seem to do anything.
[4533.74s -> 4538.80s]  Can I take this down with this?
[4538.80s -> 4550.19s]  How do I get in here?
[4559.87s -> 4562.19s]  Seeing that just fly out of somebody's house.
[4562.19s -> 4568.35s]  How do I move?
[4568.35s -> 4580.46s]  I want to get rid of the board.
[4581.02s -> 4581.66s]  Okay, yeah.
[4581.66s -> 4582.99s]  Sell all this.
[4582.99s -> 4583.63s]  So they've...
[4583.63s -> 4587.92s]  Okay, you no longer can just throw things like this in the trash.
[4587.92s -> 4589.28s]  You have to sell it.
[4589.28s -> 4604.54s]  Maybe they thought it was too easy to just go around and go like...
[4604.54s -> 4614.22s]  Just pick up everything.
[4614.54s -> 4615.98s]  There's a lot of stains.
[4615.98s -> 4619.88s]  I wonder, how does the cleaning work?
[4619.88s -> 4620.60s]  I wonder.
[4620.60s -> 4628.96s]  Um, maybe read a book on it.
[4628.96s -> 4631.26s]  Love open spaces so does your hammer.
[4631.26s -> 4635.87s]  The longer you hold the stronger will be released to see the damage.
[4635.87s -> 4641.98s]  Okay, so you actually have to be aiming at a wall.
[4641.98s -> 4646.19s]  What about just cleaning?
[4646.19s -> 4646.59s]  Building?
[4649.56s -> 4650.12s]  All right.
[4650.12s -> 4653.18s]  Yeah, that's just like the first one.
[4653.18s -> 4654.30s]  What about cleaning though?
[4654.30s -> 4655.74s]  Because I have like a spray bottle.
[4656.38s -> 4657.45s]  How does this work?
[4658.99s -> 4659.55s]  It's Q.
[4660.27s -> 4671.69s]  Is there anything in the bottle?
[4676.99s -> 4688.91s]  Ooh, just spray everything and then wipe it.
[4689.47s -> 4693.45s]  It's getting better.
[4694.01s -> 4704.00s]  Okay.
[4704.00s -> 4705.44s]  Now, how do I mop this up?
[4705.44s -> 4706.64s]  Is there a vacuum or something?
[4706.64s -> 4715.96s]  I've never seen anybody so excited to clean.
[4715.96s -> 4719.36s]  And this game is my game.
[4719.36s -> 4732.11s]  Painting, surface finish, smart home, building, demolish.
[4732.75s -> 4733.79s]  So they're different now.
[4734.51s -> 4742.86s]  Yeah, so they've split up the tools.
[4743.42s -> 4747.55s]  This is actually particles you have to vacuum up.
[4749.92s -> 4750.32s]  Huge.
[4752.09s -> 4753.21s]  Huge addition.
[4753.21s -> 4762.33s]  Why is it giving me Xbox?
[4762.33s -> 4762.89s]  Wait.
[4762.89s -> 4778.97s]  Painting.
[4778.97s -> 4781.64s]  Paint a wall, you must buy some paint.
[4781.64s -> 4783.64s]  Open the store by pressing tab to get to the paint.
[4784.28s -> 4785.40s]  Paint roller.
[4785.40s -> 4786.04s]  Aim the bucket in.
[4786.04s -> 4786.54s]  Okay.
[4787.00s -> 4790.88s]  Now pick your painting style and then hold it just like in the first one.
[4791.68s -> 4796.70s]  All right.
[4796.70s -> 4797.98s]  So I need to go to the store.
[4799.88s -> 4803.47s]  And I wonder how much they've actually added here.
[4803.47s -> 4807.44s]  So I need paint.
[4808.00s -> 4815.31s]  I guess I can just type it, right?
[4816.03s -> 4817.84s]  They've added bread.
[4818.88s -> 4819.20s]  Nice.
[4819.20s -> 4819.76s]  They have, yeah.
[4820.32s -> 4820.80s]  Look at this.
[4820.80s -> 4821.36s]  This looks good.
[4822.08s -> 4824.67s]  Have a loads of bread.
[4825.31s -> 4831.20s]  Hey, carve me off a slice of that crusty bread.
[4831.20s -> 4838.46s]  Let me just take a look.
[4838.46s -> 4840.46s]  Oh, you can actually keep things.
[4841.02s -> 4842.54s]  I like that.
[4845.50s -> 4849.82s]  I like that.
[4849.82s -> 4851.02s]  You can do plants now.
[4851.90s -> 4853.26s]  Building outside.
[4853.26s -> 4854.54s]  You can tag things.
[4856.25s -> 4856.49s]  Okay.
[4856.49s -> 4857.85s]  I need paint.
[4857.85s -> 4863.10s]  What should I do the walls?
[4863.10s -> 4872.96s]  How about orange and red vibrant paint?
[4872.96s -> 4876.16s]  So change size.
[4879.20s -> 4879.92s]  Huge addition.
[4880.72s -> 4892.80s]  Massive addition.
[4892.80s -> 4893.36s]  Okay.
[4893.36s -> 4895.52s]  So you actually have to do this now.
[4895.52s -> 4901.87s]  I feel like there's a lot more paint.
[4901.87s -> 4910.75s]  A big complaint for the last game was how much paint you actually had to put on the brush.
[4924.62s -> 4925.58s]  The noise is gross.
[4925.58s -> 4926.62s]  The noise is the best part.
[4926.62s -> 4927.66s]  What are you talking about?
[4927.66s -> 4931.56s]  I don't like this paint though.
[4931.56s -> 4937.12s]  How about this one?
[4937.12s -> 4946.73s]  That's better.
[4946.73s -> 4951.52s]  It's a really, really awesome gray.
[4959.00s -> 4960.76s]  Boring, boring, boring.
[4960.76s -> 4964.43s]  No, you don't understand.
[4964.43s -> 4971.08s]  It's a neutral color and then you have accent pieces.
[4973.26s -> 4973.98s]  Shut up.
[4973.98s -> 4977.95s]  Oops.
[4977.95s -> 4987.02s]  The music is really nice too.
[4987.02s -> 5001.92s]  They really stepped it up with the soundtrack.
[5001.92s -> 5004.92s]  That's fine.
[5004.92s -> 5008.80s]  Turn the volume down because we need to actually make sure this is not.
[5008.80s -> 5012.01s]  This is usually loud.
[5012.09s -> 5014.24s]  Very, very, very loud.
[5014.24s -> 5016.59s]  I'm going to do it here too because I'm not.
[5016.59s -> 5017.79s]  Usually it's really bad.
[5017.79s -> 5019.39s]  Let's see.
[5019.39s -> 5026.56s]  It's actually not bad.
[5026.56s -> 5043.60s]  Is this structural?
[5043.60s -> 5057.66s]  Watch the whole house collapses.
[5057.66s -> 5059.10s]  I'm opening this up a little.
[5059.10s -> 5068.24s]  I want to be able to open up this kitchen area.
[5068.24s -> 5069.68s]  It's a load-bearing wall.
[5069.68s -> 5070.16s]  It's all right.
[5070.16s -> 5073.69s]  It's a video game.
[5073.69s -> 5074.49s]  We'll be all right.
[5074.49s -> 5080.57s]  See?
[5080.57s -> 5081.77s]  Look, that's much nicer.
[5081.77s -> 5090.60s]  All right.
[5090.60s -> 5100.96s]  Now get rid of all this.
[5100.96s -> 5108.19s]  Any more trash in here?
[5108.19s -> 5113.29s]  This is too much work.
[5113.29s -> 5116.89s]  Paint the whole house one color and including all the furniture too.
[5117.13s -> 5129.10s]  Have everything be the same color?
[5129.10s -> 5130.06s]  That would give me.
[5130.06s -> 5133.00s]  I feel like that would give me anxiety being in that room
[5133.00s -> 5134.81s]  because I would have a lot of questions.
[5134.81s -> 5136.25s]  First of all, be like, why?
[5136.25s -> 5138.19s]  Why did you do this?
[5138.19s -> 5140.27s]  The second question would not even be like, why did you do this?
[5140.27s -> 5141.23s]  Interesting question.
[5142.12s -> 5143.24s]  Where did you get all this?
[5143.24s -> 5146.04s]  It must have taken you years to collect all this furniture.
[5146.04s -> 5147.56s]  That was the exact same color.
[5147.56s -> 5159.79s]  I don't need these.
[5161.95s -> 5162.75s]  Damn it.
[5162.75s -> 5164.33s]  All right.
[5164.33s -> 5172.43s]  How about still two pieces of trash that I did not get?
[5175.68s -> 5176.96s]  And where exactly are those?
[5191.15s -> 5192.03s]  Is it upstairs?
[5192.67s -> 5196.70s]  What the fuck?
[5196.70s -> 5198.16s]  Is it a doorbell?
[5198.88s -> 5202.97s]  There's way more than two pieces of trash left.
[5222.33s -> 5222.81s]  Jesus.
[5222.81s -> 5223.29s]  All right.
[5223.29s -> 5232.20s]  Why can I not activate those things?
[5232.20s -> 5232.68s]  All right.
[5232.68s -> 5234.76s]  Stains, vacuum, dirt.
[5234.76s -> 5238.20s]  There's tons of stuff to vacuum up here.
[5238.20s -> 5239.64s]  You definitely can level this up too.
[5240.28s -> 5247.26s]  Why is there a fish in the closet?
[5247.26s -> 5248.22s]  I don't know.
[5248.22s -> 5251.50s]  It's very strange.
[5251.50s -> 5272.54s]  I can reach really far.
[5272.54s -> 5283.21s]  Sell everything.
[5283.21s -> 5292.44s]  Need to make room so you can see where you need to clean.
[5292.44s -> 5304.73s]  Collecting trash.
[5304.73s -> 5305.05s]  Yep.
[5305.05s -> 5307.69s]  How to do that at this point?
[5309.61s -> 5326.67s]  I have an idea.
[5326.67s -> 5328.19s]  Get out the fucking window.
[5328.19s -> 5332.25s]  All right.
[5332.25s -> 5333.05s]  You can't do that.
[5333.05s -> 5335.56s]  I was trying to save some time.
[5335.56s -> 5336.52s]  And what am I doing?
[5336.52s -> 5340.28s]  You can do it right here.
[5340.28s -> 5342.80s]  Damn it.
[5342.80s -> 5344.08s]  Oh, that's too bad.
[5344.08s -> 5350.64s]  I'm keeping that.
[5350.64s -> 5370.80s]  Okay.
[5370.80s -> 5375.52s]  Buy 28.
[5375.52s -> 5377.12s]  Oh, we need these.
[5377.12s -> 5377.36s]  All right.
[5377.36s -> 5377.68s]  Well, hold on.
[5377.68s -> 5378.64s]  Let me sell.
[5378.64s -> 5387.66s]  Well, I need to sell more stuff.
[5387.66s -> 5389.72s]  You're very precise with this.
[5389.72s -> 5390.28s]  I tend to be.
[5398.46s -> 5399.42s]  This is a mess.
[5399.42s -> 5410.86s]  Okay.
[5410.86s -> 5426.30s]  I think that's all the trash.
[5426.30s -> 5426.78s]  Sell it.
[5426.78s -> 5427.18s]  Sell it.
[5427.18s -> 5427.82s]  Sell it.
[5427.82s -> 5441.85s]  I need to mop the walls too.
[5441.85s -> 5442.49s]  Can I clean this?
[5442.49s -> 5443.29s]  I'll try to clean it first.
[5443.29s -> 5445.82s]  I'm not going to sell everything.
[5446.22s -> 5453.76s]  Some of the junkier stuff like that and like that.
[5453.76s -> 5454.40s]  So we can...
[5454.40s -> 5455.76s]  Oh, you can duplicate.
[5455.76s -> 5461.24s]  That's cool.
[5461.24s -> 5462.60s]  Sold the plunger.
[5462.60s -> 5463.08s]  Yeah.
[5463.08s -> 5464.84s]  Do not ever sell your plunger.
[5464.84s -> 5465.80s]  I saw actually a comment.
[5465.80s -> 5468.54s]  Somebody said, what a rookie mistake.
[5468.54s -> 5470.14s]  You sold your plunger.
[5470.14s -> 5472.62s]  I mean, I didn't sell my plunger,
[5472.62s -> 5473.90s]  but I got rid of my plunger
[5473.90s -> 5475.92s]  before making sure I had another one.
[5475.92s -> 5477.44s]  That's a very big deal.
[5477.44s -> 5479.79s]  I will never make that mistake ever again.
[5483.36s -> 5484.88s]  You buy the new plunger
[5484.88s -> 5500.14s]  before you get rid of the old one.
[5500.14s -> 5503.80s]  You sold your used plunger.
[5503.80s -> 5506.36s]  We're talking about in the context of this game.
[5506.36s -> 5512.03s]  This makes or breaks my rating for the demo so far.
[5512.03s -> 5526.38s]  There's an A.
[5526.38s -> 5528.19s]  That was an A.
[5528.19s -> 5540.68s]  That's an A.
[5540.68s -> 5552.03s]  Because this one you really...
[5552.03s -> 5554.78s]  It's a whole lot more control here.
[5554.78s -> 5563.16s]  I would say it's a B minus.
[5575.90s -> 5577.52s]  You missed a bit.
[5577.52s -> 5578.48s]  I got it.
[5578.48s -> 5581.79s]  Okay.
[5581.79s -> 5584.03s]  I'm going to start in this room.
[5584.03s -> 5589.47s]  I wonder if we're going to get anybody upset
[5589.47s -> 5590.99s]  that I'm in this for more than 30 minutes.
[5595.80s -> 5596.68s]  I doubt it.
[5596.68s -> 5611.55s]  Put all the books outside.
[5611.55s -> 5612.59s]  Can stack objects?
[5613.15s -> 5614.46s]  Could you do that before?
[5615.02s -> 5623.53s]  I'm not sure you could even do that before.
[5623.53s -> 5624.54s]  Okay.
[5624.54s -> 5627.66s]  I need to buy all this new shit.
[5627.66s -> 5631.72s]  Is that what it's telling me to do?
[5631.72s -> 5654.65s]  Not yet.
[5654.65s -> 5655.05s]  Whoa.
[5660.46s -> 5672.25s]  Cool.
[5672.25s -> 5686.76s]  I like that sound too.
[5686.76s -> 5688.28s]  You couldn't do that before.
[5688.28s -> 5701.45s]  I could make a Super Mario level.
[5701.45s -> 5702.09s]  Oh my God.
[5702.09s -> 5709.20s]  I can make a Super Mario level.
[5709.20s -> 5710.00s]  No way.
[5710.00s -> 5713.76s]  Okay.
[5713.76s -> 5719.61s]  That's when the game comes up.
[5719.61s -> 5721.53s]  You can take out individual cubes now.
[5723.61s -> 5724.41s]  Didn't I say?
[5724.41s -> 5726.35s]  Didn't I say?
[5726.35s -> 5727.47s]  A couple of years ago.
[5727.47s -> 5732.35s]  Man, I wish I could place and delete individual cubes.
[5732.43s -> 5733.96s]  I said that.
[5733.96s -> 5744.59s]  Didn't I say that?
[5744.59s -> 5744.99s]  True.
[5744.99s -> 5745.23s]  True.
[5745.23s -> 5752.00s]  Yeah, I did.
[5752.00s -> 5759.68s]  You famously said that.
[5759.68s -> 5760.00s]  All right.
[5760.00s -> 5760.48s]  Let's paint.
[5761.58s -> 5763.10s]  Are we going with just the gray?
[5763.10s -> 5764.54s]  I like that color.
[5764.54s -> 5767.79s]  You can call me a normie all you want.
[5767.79s -> 5769.69s]  That's fine.
[5769.69s -> 5772.09s]  I like the like blue gray wall.
[5773.08s -> 5774.04s]  That's fine.
[5774.04s -> 5774.84s]  Go ahead.
[5774.84s -> 5793.26s]  Blues and grays are nice.
[5793.26s -> 5793.66s]  I know.
[5796.64s -> 5797.28s]  What color?
[5797.28s -> 5797.60s]  All right.
[5797.60s -> 5798.96s]  Let me ask you guys this question.
[5798.96s -> 5806.40s]  What color wall would you say is the, you know, what's your wall?
[5806.40s -> 5815.64s]  What is your ideal living room wall color?
[5815.64s -> 5816.04s]  Beige?
[5817.55s -> 5825.45s]  If it isn't beige, just like kind of the same type of neutral that gray, light gray, light blue is.
[5825.45s -> 5826.89s]  Egg shell white, white, white.
[5826.89s -> 5828.89s]  How is white is also neutral?
[5828.89s -> 5830.33s]  How is that different than gray?
[5830.33s -> 5840.56s]  It's light blue, light green.
[5840.56s -> 5842.16s]  I can see light green.
[5842.16s -> 5844.32s]  Light green would be pretty nice.
[5844.32s -> 5844.96s]  They're all nice.
[5851.72s -> 5859.08s]  I can change the color if I want in a minute.
[5859.08s -> 5868.38s]  We have to get a base here first.
[5868.38s -> 5870.46s]  He's painting without paint liners.
[5874.84s -> 5875.08s]  Yeah.
[5882.41s -> 5883.05s]  Sorry.
[5883.05s -> 5886.01s]  I bowl without the bumpers on the sides.
[5906.51s -> 5908.75s]  Somebody says landlord special.
[5911.96s -> 5912.28s]  All right.
[5912.28s -> 5913.32s]  I'm coming in.
[5913.32s -> 5913.80s]  That's right.
[5913.80s -> 5914.92s]  We're getting, I'm going to be in there.
[5914.92s -> 5916.44s]  We're going to do all new painting.
[5916.44s -> 5917.24s]  That's right.
[5917.24s -> 5919.96s]  Just make sure you're out of the apartment for a little while.
[5919.96s -> 5922.84s]  Hope you like gray and I hope you're like a really shit job.
[5924.06s -> 5927.44s]  That's exactly where you're getting a dome depot.
[5927.44s -> 5930.56s]  And I just want as much of the cheapest gray paint as I could.
[5931.20s -> 5933.52s]  I don't need wall liners or whatever.
[5933.52s -> 5936.64s]  I ain't living here.
[5936.64s -> 5938.40s]  The landlord special.
[5959.68s -> 5963.77s]  Stop painting over outlets and light switches.
[5975.55s -> 5976.27s]  That's funny.
[5982.00s -> 5983.60s]  Painting over the tile.
[5983.60s -> 5985.04s]  Wait, I can make the ground too.
[5986.40s -> 5987.76s]  You can paint the ground.
[5989.05s -> 5989.29s]  Yep.
[5989.29s -> 5991.61s]  Just coming in with the landlord special real quick.
[5994.52s -> 5995.08s]  All right.
[5995.64s -> 6001.79s]  Not a problem.
[6001.79s -> 6005.47s]  Just trying to drop my property value by as much as I possibly can.
[6009.39s -> 6009.79s]  Whatever.
[6021.53s -> 6023.37s]  If I came in and somebody was doing this to the ground,
[6024.78s -> 6025.90s]  I'd be like, all right.
[6025.90s -> 6027.58s]  What kind of special paint is that?
[6027.58s -> 6031.50s]  Because you obviously you're doing that because you're trying to block
[6031.50s -> 6033.66s]  like radiation or something, right?
[6033.66s -> 6034.54s]  Like why?
[6034.54s -> 6035.90s]  What are you painting the ground for?
[6036.80s -> 6042.16s]  Well, you know, I heard that there was a radiation could come through the floor.
[6042.16s -> 6046.80s]  So I want to make sure I have the code of this anti radiation paint.
[6046.80s -> 6054.12s]  All right.
[6054.12s -> 6058.78s]  I was just my grandmother's favorite color was, you know, dark gray.
[6059.34s -> 6062.38s]  I figured I had to see my entire fucking house around it.
[6062.94s -> 6071.53s]  What is that?
[6071.53s -> 6072.17s]  What is that?
[6072.17s -> 6072.73s]  What is that?
[6076.49s -> 6078.22s]  Get rid of that.
[6078.78s -> 6080.81s]  Oops.
[6082.51s -> 6084.43s]  Wait, did I throw trash into the ocean?
[6085.40s -> 6086.04s]  Wait a minute.
[6086.04s -> 6086.68s]  No, you can't.
[6087.40s -> 6089.82s]  No, that's fucked up.
[6089.82s -> 6090.54s]  That's not all right.
[6091.10s -> 6092.14s]  Did it work?
[6105.15s -> 6113.71s]  Uh, I mean, it is a perfectly good bin outside, but you know,
[6113.71s -> 6119.04s]  I'll just throw it in the ocean.
[6119.04s -> 6119.52s]  Wait, hold on.
[6119.52s -> 6122.40s]  Wait, wait, is there plastic in here and glass?
[6123.20s -> 6124.70s]  Yeah, whatever.
[6126.81s -> 6127.93s]  I don't want to separate that.
[6127.93s -> 6129.05s]  It's too much work for me.
[6129.77s -> 6149.55s]  See, I will reform the evil landlord villain.
[6151.64s -> 6152.52s]  Recycling now.
[6156.16s -> 6168.52s]  See, okay.
[6168.52s -> 6170.36s]  You can't paint the sand.
[6170.36s -> 6181.88s]  Okay, cool.
[6182.89s -> 6189.77s]  Well, it definitely feels like there's a lot more control.
[6189.77s -> 6192.49s]  I think you can build houses in this too.
[6192.49s -> 6194.49s]  Maybe not the demo, but I'm pretty sure that's what they're going to do.
[6195.05s -> 6197.66s]  I need something out.
[6197.66s -> 6199.50s]  This actually is making me annoyed to look at.
[6199.50s -> 6204.48s]  Um, let's go over the ground.
[6204.48s -> 6206.08s]  I don't know, like wood tile.
[6209.53s -> 6210.25s]  Wood panels.
[6216.08s -> 6216.88s]  Carpet.
[6216.88s -> 6218.57s]  What about tile?
[6218.57s -> 6219.37s]  What do they have tile?
[6221.31s -> 6222.43s]  Ooh, look at that.
[6223.07s -> 6223.63s]  I like this.
[6224.19s -> 6256.25s]  Oh, there's a picture of a tile.
[6256.25s -> 6257.85s]  Oh, I have to surface.
[6257.85s -> 6261.56s]  I, right.
[6261.56s -> 6268.16s]  Oh, let's do a test.
[6268.16s -> 6273.39s]  Cool.
[6273.39s -> 6274.83s]  That's way better than it used to be.
[6285.53s -> 6305.56s]  Wow.
[6305.56s -> 6310.09s]  Look at how cool that looks.
[6310.09s -> 6318.06s]  How do I put this down though?
[6318.06s -> 6319.18s]  And go back to the tools.
[6321.72s -> 6323.96s]  Hold right mouse button.
[6324.52s -> 6325.87s]  It was weird.
[6325.87s -> 6330.77s]  Oops.
[6331.25s -> 6336.14s]  It's like the ocean next to the ocean.
[6336.14s -> 6337.84s]  That's what I was going for.
[6337.84s -> 6349.28s]  That's what I want to be.
[6349.28s -> 6353.12s]  I want to go to like a beach and just lie there and just breathe in the air.
[6353.92s -> 6360.72s]  How come the grid is here still?
[6361.44s -> 6369.46s]  Okay.
[6369.46s -> 6370.66s]  Oh, there we go.
[6370.66s -> 6371.46s]  Nice.
[6371.46s -> 6379.81s]  I'm telling you right now, I'm going to give you a little bit of creative input here.
[6379.81s -> 6386.86s]  This has like a streamer room back wall that slowly has the lights kind of move and pulsate
[6386.86s -> 6388.93s]  through here.
[6388.93s -> 6391.81s]  Wow.
[6391.81s -> 6398.70s]  If this was just kind of like, and this kind of was a was a glowing soft green.
[6399.71s -> 6400.03s]  Whoa.
[6400.75s -> 6411.23s]  I'll give you a little bit of creative input.
[6411.23s -> 6412.35s]  Are you the streamer?
[6412.35s -> 6412.91s]  No.
[6412.91s -> 6413.63s]  Oh, God.
[6413.63s -> 6414.83s]  No, I wouldn't have that.
[6414.83s -> 6426.32s]  Oh, God.
[6426.32s -> 6427.84s]  No, that would be fucking tacky.
[6429.95s -> 6431.71s]  You don't catch me fucking doing that.
[6432.35s -> 6441.63s]  Having like a back wall that's like water next to and you're in like your beach house
[6441.63s -> 6442.43s]  and pulses.
[6444.10s -> 6448.10s]  And this kind of goes, no, would never catch me doing that.
[6448.66s -> 6455.31s]  I want to do it so bad.
[6476.43s -> 6482.90s]  Let's go with like a, what should I do here?
[6482.90s -> 6484.58s]  Smart home options.
[6484.58s -> 6488.86s]  Okay.
[6488.86s -> 6495.71s]  Wait, can I have this connected to the stove?
[6495.71s -> 6496.35s]  All right.
[6496.35s -> 6499.39s]  Can the light switch turn the stove on?
[6499.39s -> 6506.51s]  That's a very important question.
[6506.51s -> 6520.14s]  We're going to find out.
[6520.14s -> 6521.66s]  Magic beans.
[6521.66s -> 6528.14s]  Oh, I can see it already.
[6528.14s -> 6538.03s]  All right.
[6538.03s -> 6538.75s]  Let's get rid of this.
[6539.31s -> 6547.86s]  You missed a spot.
[6547.86s -> 6549.30s]  I need to clear everything out.
[6549.30s -> 6555.81s]  I don't like.
[6557.01s -> 6572.29s]  TV goes right here.
[6576.80s -> 6577.68s]  Where's the kitchen?
[6577.68s -> 6578.16s]  I don't know.
[6580.69s -> 6582.21s]  Now you like it all of a sudden.
[6582.21s -> 6582.93s]  Okay.
[6582.93s -> 6583.49s]  Yeah.
[6583.49s -> 6590.82s]  So how does, how do I clean this?
[6590.82s -> 6596.18s]  Do I have to mop it or vacuum it?
[6596.18s -> 6596.42s]  Okay.
[6596.42s -> 6609.94s]  Yeah.
[6609.94s -> 6613.79s]  No, I'm throwing this upside down.
[6613.79s -> 6620.08s]  Every kitchen usually is that kind of like beige, sand, brown, yellows.
[6620.08s -> 6625.14s]  That's a lot of kitchens, especially that I'm going different.
[6625.14s -> 6627.06s]  I'm doing like a green kitchen.
[6627.06s -> 6644.19s]  Okay.
[6644.19s -> 6647.04s]  I need floor, floor.
[6647.04s -> 6653.47s]  I need something for the floor, floor board.
[6653.47s -> 6667.42s]  Is there a way to quickly get to just like, there we go.
[6667.42s -> 6667.92s]  Okay.
[6667.92s -> 6672.52s]  Um, just, I want like floor stuff.
[6672.52s -> 6684.84s]  Construction, surface finishes, particle board, cool green paint.
[6684.84s -> 6685.56s]  Let's try it.
[6685.56s -> 6688.60s]  I feel like this is going to look all right.
[6688.60s -> 6705.38s]  How do I use the paint tape?
[6705.38s -> 6733.36s]  The paint tape.
[6733.36s -> 6734.72s]  Paint tape.
[6734.72s -> 6741.04s]  When does this come out?
[6741.04s -> 6743.76s]  When does the house number two come out?
[6743.76s -> 6744.48s]  I like it.
[6744.48s -> 6763.35s]  It's not bad.
[6763.35s -> 6774.40s]  I need to go outside and sell all these.
[6774.40s -> 6776.24s]  Nice infected armpit green.
[6776.24s -> 6777.76s]  Why do you know what that is?
[6777.76s -> 6779.96s]  That's what?
[6779.96s -> 6781.86s]  Infected armpit.
[6781.86s -> 6787.89s]  This looks nice.
[6787.89s -> 6798.52s]  Let's get to clean the windows up and we're good.
[6817.44s -> 6821.54s]  I hope your stomach is doing better.
[6821.54s -> 6822.87s]  Yeah, I'll be all right.
[6822.87s -> 6825.33s]  I'm good.
[6825.33s -> 6831.92s]  I just had to take care of that before the stream started.
[6831.92s -> 6833.28s]  I'm good though.
[6833.28s -> 6836.04s]  Make it bluer.
[6842.92s -> 6846.28s]  Uh, I mean, we've got cyan and gray.
[6846.84s -> 6849.22s]  We all know how much I like that one.
[6855.72s -> 6856.68s]  Blue paint.
[6856.68s -> 6862.47s]  Maybe, should I try the blue?
[6862.47s -> 6863.43s]  Cyan and gray.
[6863.43s -> 6865.11s]  Cyan and gray vibrant.
[6865.11s -> 6865.83s]  Faded.
[6865.83s -> 6866.95s]  Let's try this one.
[6866.95s -> 6871.92s]  This apparently is vibrant.
[6871.92s -> 6876.66s]  I wouldn't call that vibrant.
[6876.66s -> 6881.41s]  This is almost too blue.
[6881.41s -> 6885.04s]  No, no, no, no.
[6885.04s -> 6886.48s]  That's way too blue.
[6886.48s -> 6887.20s]  Way too much.
[6887.20s -> 6888.32s]  The green is better.
[6888.32s -> 6903.33s]  Green is better.
[6903.33s -> 6904.77s]  Landlord special.
[6904.77s -> 6906.98s]  What are you doing?
[6906.98s -> 6911.78s]  Oh, I'm just putting all these buckets of paint under one giant bucket.
[6911.78s -> 6913.92s]  Oh, what are you going to do with it?
[6913.92s -> 6916.56s]  I plan on throwing it as hard as I can against the wall.
[6916.56s -> 6917.44s]  Right in the middle.
[6917.44s -> 6921.24s]  Combining four or five buckets of paint.
[6921.24s -> 6927.62s]  Hey, while you're here, can you look at the sink?
[6928.26s -> 6928.98s]  No, no.
[6930.84s -> 6932.77s]  No, I don't think so.
[6935.00s -> 6935.96s]  Rents do, by the way.
[6948.02s -> 6948.90s]  I like it.
[6948.90s -> 6949.30s]  All right.
[6949.30s -> 6951.46s]  Now, this is going to stay...
[6951.46s -> 6963.64s]  Where did all this come from?
[6963.64s -> 6964.12s]  It's trash.
[6964.76s -> 6971.91s]  Did I break a window?
[6971.91s -> 6972.39s]  Why?
[6972.39s -> 6973.51s]  I thought I cleaned this already.
[6974.15s -> 6977.11s]  What's up with this?
[6977.11s -> 6977.67s]  What is that?
[6978.55s -> 6981.19s]  This one thing that didn't get painted right?
[6981.19s -> 6985.11s]  Get a girl out.
[6989.32s -> 6990.20s]  What about the ground?
[7005.36s -> 7006.90s]  I'll try this.
[7006.90s -> 7008.60s]  I just want to see what it looks like.
[7008.60s -> 7009.40s]  That's it.
[7009.40s -> 7022.45s]  We're going to do a small test to see how it is.
[7022.45s -> 7040.93s]  I need to pick it up.
[7040.93s -> 7042.29s]  Hold to start finishing.
[7043.99s -> 7045.86s]  I want to...
[7045.86s -> 7046.82s]  Wait, is it...
[7046.82s -> 7049.00s]  What's happening?
[7049.00s -> 7051.97s]  Well, I want to pick these up.
[7051.97s -> 7063.52s]  Can I not press E?
[7064.40s -> 7066.44s]  Oh, this is weird.
[7067.00s -> 7070.98s]  How high are you right now?
[7070.98s -> 7072.26s]  No, it's just I'm not used to it.
[7072.26s -> 7074.96s]  Because you have to do this part first
[7074.96s -> 7077.36s]  and then you put this away
[7077.36s -> 7078.88s]  and then pick up the tiles
[7079.52s -> 7083.73s]  and then press E here.
[7083.73s -> 7084.05s]  Okay.
[7086.21s -> 7087.01s]  I'm not a...
[7087.01s -> 7088.21s]  I'm a big fan of it, actually.
[7092.98s -> 7094.58s]  It reflects everything.
[7094.58s -> 7097.09s]  I'm going to do it.
[7097.09s -> 7097.81s]  Yeah, I'm going to do it.
[7097.81s -> 7098.21s]  That's cool.
[7102.29s -> 7103.01s]  That's how you do it.
[7103.01s -> 7103.65s]  Okay.
[7103.65s -> 7107.01s]  Now, I can't technically go out of here.
[7107.01s -> 7112.32s]  I like it.
[7112.32s -> 7113.04s]  You did good.
[7113.04s -> 7128.47s]  Hey, thanks.
[7128.47s -> 7129.27s]  Cool.
[7129.27s -> 7141.91s]  You're making a Hilton hotel.
[7141.91s -> 7147.81s]  This place is pretty nice.
[7147.81s -> 7159.35s]  I like it.
[7159.35s -> 7161.56s]  I just need a stove and a fridge.
[7161.56s -> 7163.33s]  I'm going to see if I can make this stove
[7163.33s -> 7165.81s]  turn on with this switch right here.
[7165.81s -> 7167.54s]  We'll get...
[7167.54s -> 7168.90s]  Hold on.
[7168.90s -> 7172.61s]  We're getting to about an hour in this game.
[7172.61s -> 7174.05s]  We're like 40 minutes into this game.
[7176.45s -> 7177.81s]  There's other demos to play.
[7177.81s -> 7183.28s]  I'm going to give this another 10 to 15 minutes
[7183.28s -> 7189.51s]  and we'll move on to the next one.
[7189.51s -> 7192.20s]  I saved the first two to do first
[7192.20s -> 7192.92s]  because I knew it was going to take
[7192.92s -> 7193.56s]  the most amount of time.
[7194.12s -> 7197.60s]  Lies of P and House Lipper 2.
[7203.54s -> 7203.94s]  Don't worry.
[7203.94s -> 7205.14s]  If you don't think I'm going to play this
[7206.52s -> 7207.88s]  until I puke when it comes out,
[7208.82s -> 7209.86s]  you're dreaming.
[7209.86s -> 7210.50s]  All right.
[7210.50s -> 7218.07s]  What do I want to do?
[7218.07s -> 7218.95s]  Fridge.
[7218.95s -> 7220.55s]  Let's go.
[7220.55s -> 7221.51s]  Fridge.
[7221.51s -> 7230.28s]  It's like a...
[7235.33s -> 7236.13s]  It's a beach house.
[7236.69s -> 7242.05s]  I can't open it.
[7242.69s -> 7243.91s]  Oops.
[7256.04s -> 7257.48s]  No, I want a real fridge.
[7257.48s -> 7264.00s]  I mean, it is a real fridge, but this one matches.
[7264.00s -> 7266.71s]  That matches what I'm going for.
[7266.71s -> 7280.96s]  Are you going for ugly?
[7280.96s -> 7282.40s]  I'm going for swanky.
[7282.40s -> 7294.64s]  I can't paint it.
[7294.64s -> 7316.40s]  Okay.
[7316.40s -> 7320.18s]  Nice.
[7320.18s -> 7325.97s]  I like how the Twitch has the warning
[7325.97s -> 7327.41s]  that this says the stream is content
[7327.41s -> 7328.53s]  for mature audiences,
[7328.53s -> 7329.81s]  but you're playing House Flipper.
[7329.81s -> 7331.49s]  I'm assuming that's what you said after that.
[7331.49s -> 7339.59s]  I mean, that's on every stream.
[7339.59s -> 7340.71s]  I've never turned that off.
[7345.09s -> 7347.01s]  I think they changed it
[7347.01s -> 7349.11s]  to now it's more elaborate system,
[7349.11s -> 7363.62s]  but that's been on forever because he swears.
[7366.55s -> 7369.24s]  I mean, I would consider this stream
[7369.24s -> 7370.60s]  to be a mature audience stream.
[7380.80s -> 7382.96s]  He's M-rated.
[7382.96s -> 7384.00s]  I think so.
[7384.00s -> 7390.60s]  Guys, a running joke on the channel
[7390.60s -> 7392.92s]  was about me shoving a baseball up my ass.
[7392.92s -> 7395.92s]  Yeah, I'm going to keep the mature audience filter on.
[7398.79s -> 7399.75s]  I think it should stay.
[7419.14s -> 7420.74s]  I'm getting really comfy right now
[7420.74s -> 7422.96s]  and I'll stay here all day.
[7425.67s -> 7427.11s]  Okay, we're moving on.
[7427.11s -> 7427.83s]  I got to move on.
[7427.83s -> 7429.28s]  I'll stay here all day.
[7429.28s -> 7431.12s]  I love these games so much.
[7431.12s -> 7435.56s]  I'm ready to play this when it releases.
[7435.56s -> 7437.08s]  I like the new features.
[7437.08s -> 7441.68s]  I think there's a lot more control now.
[7441.68s -> 7443.04s]  It seems like it's going to be fun.
[7448.31s -> 7449.75s]  Think of how much content there'll be
[7449.75s -> 7450.31s]  when this releases.
[7450.31s -> 7450.95s]  When does this come up?
[7452.61s -> 7453.17s]  Test the stove.
[7453.17s -> 7454.21s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7454.21s -> 7477.40s]  I don't think you can do it.
[7477.40s -> 7479.32s]  Should do another House Flipper thing with Ludwig.
[7480.21s -> 7483.17s]  I think that when this game comes out,
[7483.17s -> 7485.41s]  I have a very fun idea
[7485.41s -> 7486.85s]  and it's kind of like the thing
[7486.85s -> 7490.13s]  that we did on the stream I did with Ludwig.
[7490.95s -> 7492.15s]  Imagine a stream.
[7492.15s -> 7493.03s]  Don't steal this.
[7493.03s -> 7493.99s]  It's mine.
[7493.99s -> 7495.11s]  I'm the House Flipper guy.
[7495.75s -> 7498.24s]  You know what?
[7498.24s -> 7499.60s]  Never mind.
[7499.60s -> 7500.16s]  You'll steal it.
[7500.16s -> 7500.88s]  Somebody will steal it.
[7507.35s -> 7511.20s]  No, you're going to steal it.
[7511.20s -> 7514.58s]  Bro, no, you're going to steal it.
[7514.58s -> 7516.66s]  And then you'll get 100 billion views and I won't.
[7517.22s -> 7521.00s]  All right, this is cool.
[7521.00s -> 7521.72s]  I like it a lot.
[7521.72s -> 7523.08s]  I'm looking forward when it comes out.
[7523.08s -> 7523.64s]  Wishlist.
[7526.66s -> 7529.78s]  Dude, HGTV did this 19 years ago.
[7533.54s -> 7534.18s]  I'm kidding around.
[7534.18s -> 7539.78s]  I want to get streamers to make houses in this game and judge them.
[7539.78s -> 7541.78s]  So at the same time, everybody makes a house.
[7541.78s -> 7544.66s]  You know, you got like six, seven, eight potential streamers.
[7544.66s -> 7545.62s]  They all make a house.
[7545.62s -> 7548.32s]  They all have the same amount of time.
[7548.32s -> 7551.40s]  And I go through and have to grade them.
[7553.48s -> 7556.04s]  I think that's fun.
[7556.04s -> 7556.92s]  You literally did that.
[7556.92s -> 7561.56s]  Yeah, but I'm talking about much more elaborate.
[7561.56s -> 7561.96s]  Stolen.
[7561.96s -> 7562.44s]  Here it comes.
[7562.44s -> 7566.29s]  That's fine.
[7566.29s -> 7570.84s]  I walk around with a clipboard and it's me judging it.
[7570.84s -> 7572.12s]  You have terrible taste.
[7572.12s -> 7573.96s]  I think that's why I want to do it.
[7573.96s -> 7583.41s]  Community house building.
[7586.44s -> 7587.96s]  No one could steal this.
[7589.51s -> 7594.05s]  I know that elaborate idea of play house flipper and I grade your house.
[7594.93s -> 7598.29s]  Whoa, we're talking fucking gold.
[7598.29s -> 7601.96s]  All right, let's keep going.
[7601.96s -> 7602.44s]  That was fun.
[7602.44s -> 7603.16s]  I really like it.
[7603.16s -> 7609.72s]  What am I going to play next?
[7609.72s -> 7626.34s]  How about I could do we do a bunch in a row now
[7626.34s -> 7629.54s]  because those are the ones I knew I wanted to at least hang out in for like a few minutes.
[7629.54s -> 7630.60s]  What?
[7630.60s -> 7631.80s]  Where did my steam go?
[7631.80s -> 7636.72s]  I think my steam crashed.
[7636.72s -> 7643.08s]  Yeah.
[7643.08s -> 7645.56s]  Oh, shit.
[7645.56s -> 7650.53s]  That was my steam.
[7654.40s -> 7655.92s]  Well, let's try this again.
[7655.92s -> 7665.52s]  Well, my steam is messed up.
[7665.52s -> 7669.00s]  I can't even open steam anymore.
[7669.00s -> 7670.05s]  This is weird.
[7676.29s -> 7676.85s]  Hold on.
[7678.23s -> 7678.95s]  Take a break anyways.
[7678.95s -> 7679.75s]  I'll be right back.
[7679.75s -> 7684.20s]  I'll take a quick break.
[7684.20s -> 7687.56s]  Get this fixed and use the bathroom.
[7687.56s -> 7836.00s]  See you in a minute.
[7836.00s -> 7838.56s]  Okay, I'm back.
[7838.56s -> 7839.28s]  I fixed it.
[7839.28s -> 7840.32s]  I had to restart steam.
[7844.64s -> 7851.84s]  The next demo we're going to check out is called pull stay.
[7851.84s -> 7853.04s]  Pull stay.
[7854.82s -> 7856.64s]  Beat him up.
[7856.64s -> 7858.56s]  Tower defense mechanics?
[7858.56s -> 7862.29s]  I don't know.
[7862.29s -> 7863.17s]  Looked interesting.
[7863.17s -> 7864.60s]  Let's try it.
[7874.39s -> 7874.95s]  Controller.
[7875.99s -> 7876.55s]  Let me try it.
[7882.85s -> 7896.82s]  That's a weird resolution.
[7896.82s -> 7897.30s]  Pull stay.
[7897.30s -> 7897.94s]  Here it is.
[7897.94s -> 7905.40s]  I don't know if it's too loud.
[7905.96s -> 7913.83s]  Play.
[7913.83s -> 7914.47s]  Move, run.
[7915.19s -> 7919.14s]  Okay.
[7920.18s -> 7921.19s]  Attack, jump.
[7921.19s -> 7921.51s]  There we go.
[7921.51s -> 7921.99s]  All right.
[7921.99s -> 7927.94s]  Attack, jump.
[7927.94s -> 7928.34s]  All right.
[7928.34s -> 7929.30s]  Plus one ore.
[7931.25s -> 7933.88s]  Grab an enemy to throw.
[7933.88s -> 7938.82s]  How do you grab an enemy?
[7938.82s -> 7945.73s]  You can run over enemies.
[7946.37s -> 7947.32s]  Oh, you run.
[7947.32s -> 7948.04s]  You walk into them.
[7948.04s -> 7956.74s]  I see.
[7956.74s -> 7958.74s]  Run over enemies on the ground.
[7958.74s -> 7959.94s]  Interact objects.
[7959.94s -> 7963.96s]  Okay.
[7966.05s -> 7966.93s]  They are coming.
[7967.49s -> 7969.96s]  How do I use the chair?
[7970.52s -> 7971.80s]  Please help me, Robo.
[7971.80s -> 7973.48s]  I'm here on the second floor.
[7973.48s -> 7974.76s]  Make sure nobody comes into my room.
[7983.38s -> 7983.78s]  Oh, shit.
[7983.78s -> 7985.54s]  I got to go to the second floor like right now.
[7985.54s -> 7996.74s]  Can I run faster?
[7996.74s -> 7997.64s]  Choose an item.
[7998.63s -> 7999.43s]  Lower damage.
[7999.99s -> 8000.87s]  Increase attack power.
[8005.12s -> 8006.16s]  Where is this dude's room?
[8008.21s -> 8009.57s]  I'm up on the second floor, right?
[8010.37s -> 8013.54s]  Oh, here we go.
[8015.12s -> 8015.36s]  All right.
[8015.36s -> 8016.32s]  I'm here to protect you.
[8027.01s -> 8027.65s]  Help me.
[8027.65s -> 8028.05s]  Soon.
[8029.64s -> 8031.32s]  Someone came upstairs.
[8031.32s -> 8033.46s]  I can hear footsteps almost here.
[8034.18s -> 8034.74s]  Hey, Robo.
[8034.74s -> 8035.46s]  Don't forget that.
[8035.78s -> 8038.10s]  You can teleport toward me when I am cornered.
[8038.66s -> 8040.42s]  Press attack and jump at the same time.
[8040.98s -> 8043.06s]  It will unleash rising tackle.
[8043.92s -> 8045.84s]  You would lose your health accordingly, though.
[8046.48s -> 8052.98s]  All right.
[8052.98s -> 8053.38s]  Watch out.
[8053.38s -> 8054.10s]  I got to get out there.
[8054.66s -> 8062.80s]  Don't worry.
[8062.80s -> 8063.36s]  They won't get in.
[8074.74s -> 8075.83s]  Good.
[8075.83s -> 8079.51s]  You learned Goran Nappa while running.
[8080.23s -> 8082.13s]  How do you run?
[8082.77s -> 8089.44s]  I feel like they will be back soon.
[8089.44s -> 8089.68s]  Okay.
[8090.32s -> 8094.00s]  Let's prepare for that while open homework menu.
[8096.80s -> 8099.67s]  Uh, attack bar.
[8100.31s -> 8102.96s]  You can sit.
[8103.52s -> 8103.76s]  Hold on.
[8103.76s -> 8104.32s]  What does it say?
[8104.32s -> 8104.64s]  Dang.
[8104.64s -> 8106.56s]  They're coming back with their friend.
[8107.20s -> 8110.13s]  I felt this would happen.
[8111.01s -> 8111.65s]  Oh, no.
[8112.45s -> 8118.21s]  So I should go downstairs.
[8118.77s -> 8123.97s]  Can I go back downstairs?
[8125.91s -> 8130.05s]  Tap when the stairs room or second floor.
[8133.99s -> 8134.71s]  Almost done.
[8135.43s -> 8137.32s]  Oh, he's making my upgrade.
[8138.04s -> 8147.99s]  I want to use that sword more.
[8156.74s -> 8157.06s]  All right.
[8158.44s -> 8158.76s]  Get him.
[8158.76s -> 8159.00s]  All right.
[8159.00s -> 8159.24s]  We're good.
[8159.24s -> 8159.56s]  We're good.
[8160.12s -> 8161.81s]  Only one more enemy.
[8167.57s -> 8168.29s]  Thank you, Robo.
[8170.37s -> 8172.85s]  Now we have a time to prepare for the next wave.
[8173.41s -> 8174.71s]  All right.
[8174.71s -> 8181.97s]  Give it to me.
[8181.97s -> 8182.69s]  Change weapon.
[8185.60s -> 8186.80s]  What should I use?
[8186.80s -> 8188.32s]  The flute?
[8189.12s -> 8191.01s]  What is that?
[8191.01s -> 8193.08s]  I'm using the triangle.
[8193.08s -> 8199.16s]  Yeah.
[8199.16s -> 8200.44s]  What is going on?
[8206.08s -> 8206.48s]  Why?
[8206.48s -> 8207.44s]  Why am I doing this?
[8208.24s -> 8221.38s]  How do I do this?
[8222.02s -> 8231.04s]  How do I hit the ball?
[8231.68s -> 8237.24s]  Oh, okay.
[8237.24s -> 8239.51s]  I did it.
[8239.51s -> 8240.15s]  Motivated.
[8243.57s -> 8244.77s]  What is going on?
[8245.49s -> 8249.96s]  Is somebody breaking into our neighbor's house?
[8250.52s -> 8257.44s]  It's time for some free time.
[8258.92s -> 8260.44s]  Oh, all right.
[8260.44s -> 8261.24s]  I got my upgrade.
[8265.86s -> 8281.24s]  Make another one.
[8281.24s -> 8281.96s]  I love this.
[8283.80s -> 8285.16s]  It's got a charm to it.
[8286.87s -> 8294.79s]  I'm interested in what you do with the actual stuff on the top.
[8295.67s -> 8296.95s]  You've ore and crystals.
[8299.68s -> 8305.14s]  I have no idea what's going on, but I'm curious.
[8307.11s -> 8307.59s]  Press B.
[8309.25s -> 8309.97s]  He's not done making it.
[8313.97s -> 8314.13s]  All right.
[8314.13s -> 8314.53s]  Here they come.
[8321.28s -> 8322.80s]  Where do they actually come in from?
[8323.36s -> 8325.00s]  Is this the dollhouse?
[8328.12s -> 8328.84s]  It kind of is.
[8329.48s -> 8334.71s]  Am I dead?
[8334.71s -> 8334.95s]  No.
[8338.50s -> 8339.14s]  All right.
[8339.14s -> 8344.87s]  I'm going to die.
[8345.43s -> 8350.90s]  How do I get away from that?
[8357.28s -> 8358.72s]  You learned knee kick.
[8367.88s -> 8368.68s]  They tricked us.
[8369.24s -> 8372.64s]  They're breaking into our backyard.
[8373.28s -> 8377.30s]  Buddy, go cover the west side.
[8377.86s -> 8384.61s]  Do I have any heals?
[8384.61s -> 8391.91s]  Fuck out of here.
[8402.85s -> 8404.29s]  I'm dead if I get hit once.
[8404.29s -> 8417.33s]  Holy shit.
[8417.33s -> 8418.53s]  What just happened?
[8418.53s -> 8424.00s]  All right.
[8424.00s -> 8425.28s]  Beat the first level.
[8425.28s -> 8434.31s]  They are coming.
[8434.31s -> 8436.61s]  Are you almost done with that upgrade?
[8436.61s -> 8437.09s]  Come on.
[8437.09s -> 8437.89s]  Hurry up.
[8437.89s -> 8441.99s]  Make sure nobody comes in my room.
[8441.99s -> 8442.23s]  All right.
[8442.23s -> 8442.63s]  I got you.
[8443.27s -> 8452.72s]  You learned karate kick.
[8452.72s -> 8460.58s]  What is this guy eating?
[8464.95s -> 8465.89s]  Attack power up.
[8465.89s -> 8466.69s]  We're good.
[8466.69s -> 8472.16s]  I don't know where that guy came from.
[8472.16s -> 8474.96s]  Who's running?
[8477.38s -> 8478.34s]  Whose shadow is that?
[8480.13s -> 8480.29s]  Wait.
[8480.29s -> 8481.41s]  Are they almost in the room?
[8481.41s -> 8481.97s]  They're almost in the room.
[8481.97s -> 8484.50s]  They're almost in the room.
[8484.50s -> 8485.30s]  Oh, my God.
[8489.67s -> 8489.99s]  Help me.
[8489.99s -> 8490.23s]  Help me.
[8490.23s -> 8490.47s]  Help me.
[8490.47s -> 8490.95s]  I'm coming.
[8490.95s -> 8491.75s]  I'm here.
[8491.75s -> 8503.81s]  How do I?
[8503.81s -> 8503.97s]  Okay.
[8503.97s -> 8504.61s]  There we go.
[8504.61s -> 8505.49s]  I can get them on the ground.
[8505.49s -> 8505.97s]  Free time.
[8505.97s -> 8506.53s]  Nice.
[8506.53s -> 8510.66s]  Next wave.
[8512.96s -> 8514.79s]  Should I do health or defense?
[8514.79s -> 8515.51s]  Let's do defense.
[8516.07s -> 8521.30s]  Don't get hit.
[8521.30s -> 8521.78s]  Awesome.
[8529.91s -> 8531.67s]  Defense equals health.
[8532.74s -> 8533.30s]  Five head.
[8536.77s -> 8537.41s]  Task completed.
[8537.41s -> 8537.65s]  All right.
[8537.65s -> 8538.29s]  Where is it out here?
[8538.93s -> 8542.76s]  Say hello to delinquent.
[8543.32s -> 8545.84s]  Lovely day, isn't it?
[8550.90s -> 8551.46s]  I...
[8551.46s -> 8551.86s]  Yeah.
[8551.86s -> 8552.26s]  All right.
[8552.90s -> 8554.07s]  What do I do?
[8562.34s -> 8562.74s]  God.
[8564.18s -> 8565.06s]  Can I do this?
[8565.86s -> 8569.54s]  I can't.
[8570.34s -> 8576.85s]  I'm getting so many materials.
[8576.85s -> 8577.81s]  Holy shit.
[8577.81s -> 8578.61s]  Give me all of it.
[8579.25s -> 8585.17s]  How do you sprint?
[8587.01s -> 8587.65s]  They're in his room.
[8587.65s -> 8588.21s]  They're in his room.
[8588.21s -> 8588.61s]  I gotta go.
[8593.88s -> 8594.20s]  I got it.
[8594.20s -> 8594.52s]  I got it.
[8594.52s -> 8594.92s]  I got it.
[8594.92s -> 8595.16s]  I'm fine.
[8595.16s -> 8595.56s]  I'm fine.
[8595.56s -> 8595.80s]  I'm fine.
[8595.80s -> 8599.08s]  I'm fine.
[8599.08s -> 8599.48s]  Stop.
[8600.12s -> 8618.85s]  Okay.
[8620.29s -> 8621.25s]  Can you make any more?
[8621.25s -> 8621.89s]  Don't do that.
[8627.12s -> 8627.36s]  Dude.
[8628.08s -> 8629.97s]  What is this guy doing?
[8630.77s -> 8635.25s]  You learned pile driver.
[8635.25s -> 8637.17s]  Grab an enemy jump and then press X.
[8637.73s -> 8639.75s]  All right.
[8639.75s -> 8640.15s]  Free time.
[8640.15s -> 8642.79s]  I need you to make health.
[8642.79s -> 8650.71s]  I want to go explore the world though.
[8654.50s -> 8655.46s]  Interact with the clock.
[8657.35s -> 8659.11s]  Oh, you can have the next wave come immediately.
[8659.11s -> 8659.91s]  Hold on.
[8659.91s -> 8665.62s]  What is this?
[8666.42s -> 8674.31s]  What do I do that for?
[8674.31s -> 8683.35s]  Does that mean it's all the way over here?
[8683.35s -> 8684.39s]  Where's this health?
[8684.39s -> 8691.16s]  That's a huge...
[8691.16s -> 8691.48s]  Uh-oh.
[8692.37s -> 8692.93s]  Oh, no.
[8692.93s -> 8693.65s]  I might...
[8693.65s -> 8694.21s]  No, I'm good.
[8694.93s -> 8695.57s]  Where's the health?
[8704.77s -> 8705.57s]  That was...
[8706.37s -> 8707.32s]  All right.
[8707.32s -> 8708.44s]  This game is fucking great.
[8708.44s -> 8709.48s]  I don't care what anybody says.
[8710.66s -> 8711.30s]  Why did it...
[8711.30s -> 8712.34s]  Where is my health?
[8731.81s -> 8734.45s]  You learned stamp, stamp.
[8734.45s -> 8736.29s]  In front of a lying enemy, it's down, down.
[8736.29s -> 8740.55s]  Give me that.
[8740.55s -> 8741.51s]  Down, down.
[8741.51s -> 8760.37s]  What's that sound?
[8760.93s -> 8761.43s]  All right.
[8761.43s -> 8763.83s]  Make a defense coding.
[8763.83s -> 8774.16s]  Something else I can do back here.
[8774.16s -> 8776.12s]  Did I actually just ruin everything?
[8776.12s -> 8783.30s]  But wait, what can I do about this?
[8783.94s -> 8787.75s]  Oh, all right.
[8787.75s -> 8788.55s]  Make a...
[8788.55s -> 8789.35s]  Make another one of those.
[8794.05s -> 8795.17s]  Build an extra room.
[8797.44s -> 8801.89s]  Kitchen, bathroom, living room, living room.
[8807.01s -> 8808.21s]  And then a bathroom.
[8808.21s -> 8810.66s]  And then a bathroom.
[8810.66s -> 8815.43s]  All right.
[8815.43s -> 8815.83s]  We're good.
[8815.83s -> 8839.91s]  Does the damage increase depending on how high you go?
[8839.91s -> 8842.58s]  They're in the room.
[8846.24s -> 8846.88s]  How do I do the move?
[8847.60s -> 8848.63s]  I got to get over there.
[8850.74s -> 8850.98s]  Go!
[8856.16s -> 8856.88s]  Get over there!
[8857.52s -> 8867.99s]  This dude's embedded into the wall.
[8873.00s -> 8885.81s]  Jump, dive kick, back downstairs.
[8885.81s -> 8887.73s]  Can you make some more items, please?
[8887.73s -> 8911.83s]  What's that?
[8911.83s -> 8917.51s]  What's in your head?
[8917.51s -> 8918.47s]  Yeah, what is that?
[8918.47s -> 8926.60s]  Short of resources?
[8927.72s -> 8928.76s]  Oh, I need crystals.
[8928.76s -> 8930.20s]  Where do I get resources?
[8930.20s -> 8939.24s]  I did it.
[8939.24s -> 8945.59s]  Sundown.
[8945.59s -> 8948.47s]  They are coming.
[8948.47s -> 8953.46s]  I think I have to break stuff on either side, right?
[8953.46s -> 8955.30s]  That scared the shit out of me.
[8955.30s -> 8963.76s]  Get up.
[8963.76s -> 8979.62s]  All right.
[8979.62s -> 8981.94s]  This move was good, but not really because it takes too much time.
[8981.94s -> 8989.12s]  The animation takes too long.
[8989.12s -> 8990.80s]  It's not DPS efficient.
[8990.80s -> 9008.13s]  I need health.
[9008.13s -> 9009.09s]  Really bad.
[9009.09s -> 9020.60s]  I'm all right.
[9020.60s -> 9026.28s]  I have two lives, I think.
[9026.28s -> 9027.78s]  Okay.
[9027.78s -> 9033.01s]  Actually, let me take the health and then I want to go break this stuff over here to
[9033.01s -> 9036.77s]  get materials, right?
[9036.77s -> 9037.81s]  That makes sense, doesn't it?
[9039.12s -> 9040.24s]  There's nothing else over here, right?
[9054.48s -> 9056.00s]  I didn't finish the one on the other side.
[9056.64s -> 9058.71s]  That was a mistake.
[9070.13s -> 9071.01s]  These guys are the worst.
[9079.92s -> 9093.56s]  There's so many people on this other side.
[9093.56s -> 9094.60s]  It's ridiculous.
[9103.04s -> 9106.92s]  What is this?
[9107.91s -> 9111.62s]  A booby pie?
[9111.62s -> 9112.34s]  What did I just do?
[9117.78s -> 9119.94s]  Oh, it automatically attacks.
[9119.94s -> 9130.18s]  Does it heal?
[9130.18s -> 9131.38s]  Help me soon.
[9131.38s -> 9134.79s]  Did they actually get in?
[9142.52s -> 9150.93s]  Damage.
[9150.93s -> 9151.57s]  Yes.
[9151.57s -> 9151.97s]  Okay.
[9151.97s -> 9153.99s]  It's not ready yet.
[9153.99s -> 9156.68s]  It's not ready yet.
[9156.68s -> 9156.92s]  All right.
[9156.92s -> 9158.60s]  I need to make some defense here.
[9158.60s -> 9167.86s]  How do I do it?
[9167.86s -> 9168.74s]  Body pillow?
[9169.22s -> 9172.63s]  Toothpaste tube.
[9172.63s -> 9174.84s]  What is body pillow?
[9174.84s -> 9179.76s]  What the fuck is this for?
[9179.76s -> 9190.40s]  Ultra glove.
[9190.40s -> 9199.01s]  Wait, can I put it on?
[9199.01s -> 9200.80s]  Oh my God.
[9200.80s -> 9201.04s]  Okay.
[9201.04s -> 9202.08s]  Hold on a second.
[9202.08s -> 9203.75s]  Where are they coming from?
[9209.22s -> 9209.86s]  I see them.
[9210.50s -> 9212.74s]  I see you pieces of shit.
[9212.74s -> 9217.36s]  Handle this.
[9217.36s -> 9228.24s]  I have to look down.
[9240.98s -> 9242.74s]  What the fuck just happened?
[9242.74s -> 9246.16s]  I'm dead.
[9253.59s -> 9255.19s]  How do I get back there?
[9255.19s -> 9261.89s]  Okay.
[9261.89s -> 9264.21s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[9264.21s -> 9274.02s]  Are they killing them?
[9274.02s -> 9292.32s]  They're going to get in.
[9292.32s -> 9299.22s]  I got to pile drive this guy out of the sky box.
[9299.22s -> 9305.83s]  One more.
[9307.64s -> 9320.61s]  What's going on?
[9320.61s -> 9333.64s]  Is there a train coming?
[9333.64s -> 9335.00s]  Why is there a train coming?
[9347.73s -> 9349.57s]  Citroen grill?
[9349.57s -> 9351.01s]  I need resources.
[9351.01s -> 9371.03s]  Okay.
[9371.03s -> 9376.53s]  This is hurting my eyes.
[9376.53s -> 9377.33s]  Get out.
[9377.33s -> 9378.29s]  I need a pile driver.
[9382.32s -> 9395.03s]  Can we do demos all night in sorcery tomorrow?
[9395.03s -> 9398.12s]  I, you know, I would say yes,
[9398.12s -> 9403.19s]  but the council of sorcery
[9403.19s -> 9409.62s]  would be very, very upset with me if I said yes.
[9409.62s -> 9411.38s]  Time field collapse detected.
[9411.38s -> 9419.41s]  High energy phenomenon is approaching to us.
[9419.41s -> 9422.45s]  If we are waiting here, our neighbors might be harmed badly.
[9422.45s -> 9424.44s]  Let's counter him on the way.
[9430.24s -> 9430.80s]  Jesus.
[9431.36s -> 9438.63s]  All right.
[9438.63s -> 9439.67s]  It's too red.
[9440.31s -> 9441.19s]  All right.
[9441.19s -> 9441.99s]  This is loud.
[9450.26s -> 9450.82s]  Get in there.
[9451.46s -> 9459.36s]  Give me that.
[9459.36s -> 9460.24s]  Where is it?
[9460.24s -> 9460.48s]  What?
[9461.51s -> 9462.07s]  Pick it up.
[9462.79s -> 9467.14s]  Give me that.
[9467.14s -> 9467.38s]  All right.
[9467.38s -> 9468.26s]  I got it.
[9468.26s -> 9474.84s]  That just killed me.
[9474.84s -> 9482.05s]  Let's get a virtual boy on.
[9482.05s -> 9482.85s]  Yeah.
[9482.85s -> 9494.72s]  All right.
[9494.72s -> 9496.08s]  Just, just bully.
[9496.08s -> 9498.50s]  Don't, do not let him even do anything.
[9499.91s -> 9500.79s]  Just chain grab.
[9500.79s -> 9501.51s]  Be obnoxious.
[9502.23s -> 9519.28s]  All right.
[9519.28s -> 9519.52s]  Got him.
[9519.52s -> 9519.76s]  Got him.
[9519.76s -> 9530.24s]  I got him.
[9530.24s -> 9531.76s]  Hey, thank you for playing.
[9531.76s -> 9539.36s]  So that was, that was called pole stay.
[9539.36s -> 9541.01s]  The name of that one.
[9541.01s -> 9545.49s]  That was a wild ride.
[9545.49s -> 9546.05s]  Pole stay.
[9553.35s -> 9553.59s]  All right.
[9553.59s -> 9553.99s]  Next one.
[9556.88s -> 9557.68s]  That one was quick.
[9557.68s -> 9558.72s]  That was snappy.
[9558.72s -> 9568.00s]  I don't know when that one comes on.
[9568.00s -> 9570.48s]  How about pizza possum?
[9570.48s -> 9572.15s]  That was pretty pog to me.
[9572.15s -> 9587.30s]  Let's try pizza possum.
[9587.30s -> 9591.38s]  And it's, it's going to be bright when I press this button.
[9591.38s -> 9592.82s]  Just to give you a warning.
[9592.82s -> 9593.62s]  Very bright.
[9593.62s -> 9598.23s]  You ready?
[9598.23s -> 9601.33s]  Pizza possum.
[9601.33s -> 9602.29s]  Let's go.
[9602.29s -> 9604.56s]  Okay.
[9604.56s -> 9605.36s]  You eat food.
[9611.35s -> 9612.95s]  Oh, I have to eat food and then I get a key.
[9612.95s -> 9614.15s]  Do I have to not get spotted?
[9614.79s -> 9619.65s]  That was pizza possum.
[9619.65s -> 9620.61s]  That was fun.
[9620.61s -> 9627.19s]  Okay.
[9627.19s -> 9629.56s]  You have to eat and not get spotted.
[9629.56s -> 9629.88s]  I get it.
[9632.04s -> 9633.08s]  Oh, shit.
[9633.08s -> 9633.56s]  Can you jump?
[9641.94s -> 9642.34s]  Shit.
[9642.34s -> 9642.90s]  All right.
[9642.90s -> 9643.46s]  This is fun.
[9643.46s -> 9643.86s]  Hold on.
[9643.86s -> 9653.20s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9653.20s -> 9656.32s]  So if I press, I can eat the food if I press a button.
[9656.32s -> 9656.88s]  No, I can't.
[9656.88s -> 9657.36s]  All right.
[9657.36s -> 9658.40s]  I guess let's slow down.
[9671.68s -> 9672.24s]  Got it.
[9672.24s -> 9684.66s]  How long can I do this for?
[9684.66s -> 9685.46s]  Oh, you can hide.
[9691.48s -> 9692.36s]  Now I want a pizza.
[9695.52s -> 9695.92s]  Wait a minute.
[9695.92s -> 9696.48s]  I'm too fat.
[9697.60s -> 9701.43s]  I think if you eat too much, you get big.
[9702.07s -> 9710.90s]  How come I'm eating so many of them?
[9710.90s -> 9715.80s]  Wait, nobody's hostile here.
[9720.96s -> 9722.08s]  Drop all your tomatoes.
[9731.27s -> 9732.47s]  I think things respawn too.
[9738.90s -> 9739.22s]  All right.
[9739.22s -> 9739.94s]  I can't.
[9739.94s -> 9740.58s]  Wait.
[9740.58s -> 9740.90s]  Okay.
[9741.46s -> 9741.94s]  Checkpoint.
[9745.88s -> 9746.36s]  This is the...
[9746.36s -> 9746.84s]  Wait a minute.
[9747.40s -> 9748.60s]  It might be a problem here.
[9748.60s -> 9749.22s]  Excuse me.
[9749.22s -> 9751.38s]  This is the sorcery enjoyers high council.
[9751.38s -> 9758.48s]  We would allow you to play the game tomorrow if you promise to play at least for four or more hours.
[9758.48s -> 9761.52s]  If this is not met, know that flanker is already on standby.
[9761.84s -> 9765.75s]  There is a curse placed upon you that will go into effect as well.
[9765.75s -> 9766.47s]  Hmm.
[9766.47s -> 9769.16s]  No, we'll do it today.
[9769.16s -> 9780.45s]  Energy drink for a quick boost.
[9780.45s -> 9784.61s]  So if there's no jump, how would I...
[9784.61s -> 9791.12s]  I'm just kind of a nuisance.
[9794.71s -> 9794.87s]  Okay.
[9794.87s -> 9796.79s]  So the dogs are security guards.
[9797.35s -> 9801.57s]  Holy shit.
[9801.57s -> 9802.37s]  There's a lot of ice cream.
[9804.16s -> 9804.40s]  No.
[9805.36s -> 9805.68s]  All right.
[9805.68s -> 9806.00s]  All right.
[9806.00s -> 9806.24s]  All right.
[9806.24s -> 9809.28s]  All right.
[9809.28s -> 9810.56s]  Dogs love chasing bones.
[9811.28s -> 9814.07s]  This game is very cute.
[9814.07s -> 9814.47s]  I like it.
[9815.03s -> 9816.71s]  Try one more time.
[9816.71s -> 9825.75s]  Just outrun the dog and you're good.
[9826.31s -> 9828.45s]  Can you turn around?
[9829.09s -> 9830.40s]  What game is this?
[9830.40s -> 9832.00s]  This game is called pizza possum.
[9837.32s -> 9837.88s]  Get that bone.
[9838.52s -> 9855.96s]  Give me all the ice cream.
[9855.96s -> 9856.28s]  All right.
[9856.28s -> 9857.00s]  I almost have enough.
[9857.99s -> 9858.71s]  Zeppola?
[9862.18s -> 9864.26s]  He's going to start sorcery and then he's going to end the stream.
[9865.83s -> 9876.07s]  No, that's not going to happen.
[9876.07s -> 9876.31s]  All right.
[9876.31s -> 9879.27s]  So it's about getting the best route because everything respawns.
[9879.27s -> 9882.55s]  So you're really going to just kind of go fast and eat, eat, eat, eat, and then open the door.
[9883.19s -> 9892.18s]  No, we're going to play sorcery.
[9892.18s -> 9893.06s]  Don't worry.
[9893.06s -> 9896.58s]  We're going to play sorcery for at least two to three hours.
[9896.58s -> 9897.54s]  At least.
[9897.54s -> 9897.78s]  Okay.
[9900.44s -> 9901.24s]  Don't worry.
[9901.24s -> 9904.02s]  I got you.
[9904.02s -> 9904.50s]  I got you.
[9916.60s -> 9917.64s]  Council is displeased.
[9917.64s -> 9924.63s]  We'll just wait till the council here is flanker talk again for the first time in like a year.
[9937.68s -> 9938.24s]  Hmm.
[9938.24s -> 9939.54s]  I think it's going to go.
[9939.54s -> 9939.78s]  Go.
[9940.42s -> 9944.18s]  All right.
[9944.18s -> 9948.02s]  If you do too much too quick, you that's what slows you down.
[9948.02s -> 9948.66s]  I get it.
[9948.66s -> 9963.76s]  I like the soundtrack plays kind of while you're doing things.
[9965.97s -> 9966.77s]  Turn around.
[9966.77s -> 9985.06s]  Ah, I got a key.
[9985.06s -> 9987.99s]  I got a key.
[9987.99s -> 9990.23s]  Wait, that was illegal.
[9990.95s -> 9992.61s]  All right.
[9993.92s -> 9994.40s]  One more time.
[9994.40s -> 9995.20s]  One more time.
[9995.20s -> 9995.68s]  And I'm done.
[9996.24s -> 10012.18s]  I'm going to throw a bone.
[10012.18s -> 10017.75s]  How long does the bone last?
[10019.20s -> 10020.08s]  Not that long.
[10020.72s -> 10021.51s]  Okay.
[10021.51s -> 10022.39s]  And I'm not going to screw up.
[10030.29s -> 10030.93s]  All right.
[10030.93s -> 10046.60s]  All right.
[10046.60s -> 10047.56s]  We're almost there.
[10047.56s -> 10052.40s]  Give me.
[10052.40s -> 10055.76s]  All right.
[10055.76s -> 10058.69s]  I can open this door.
[10058.69s -> 10068.53s]  Looks so real.
[10068.53s -> 10069.57s]  Dogs won't be able to tell the difference.
[10069.57s -> 10070.77s]  It's a dog mask.
[10070.77s -> 10077.88s]  Oh, I'm going to put it on and run right through.
[10083.44s -> 10084.16s]  That's silly.
[10085.28s -> 10086.08s]  This is silly.
[10096.52s -> 10096.84s]  Okay.
[10097.64s -> 10100.98s]  I'm going down.
[10101.62s -> 10103.62s]  So you slowly unlock the level.
[10103.62s -> 10112.52s]  This is silly.
[10113.08s -> 10118.45s]  Look at that over there.
[10118.45s -> 10120.13s]  Look at that huge feast over there.
[10120.13s -> 10128.16s]  This is going to be insane.
[10128.72s -> 10139.20s]  All right.
[10139.20s -> 10139.52s]  Hide.
[10148.52s -> 10149.72s]  I need the whole thing.
[10149.72s -> 10152.48s]  I think I got it all.
[10153.36s -> 10154.80s]  It's awesome.
[10154.80s -> 10155.44s]  Thank you.
[10155.44s -> 10157.12s]  Hungry wish list.
[10158.34s -> 10160.20s]  Oh, okay.
[10160.20s -> 10160.92s]  It was timed.
[10167.64s -> 10168.36s]  I liked it.
[10168.36s -> 10169.00s]  That was cute.
[10171.48s -> 10172.04s]  I liked it.
[10172.68s -> 10178.44s]  You know, this is a game that I could see myself
[10178.44s -> 10182.18s]  just kind of relaxing in bed and playing it.
[10182.18s -> 10183.81s]  I liked it.
[10185.73s -> 10186.61s]  Nice job.
[10186.61s -> 10190.42s]  All right.
[10190.42s -> 10191.14s]  We're going to do.
[10191.14s -> 10194.05s]  This is another kind of more chilled out relaxing one.
[10194.05s -> 10196.37s]  This is called Station to Station.
[10196.37s -> 10207.73s]  Looks like you build a train station.
[10208.13s -> 10215.24s]  I know.
[10215.24s -> 10228.52s]  I think this is not a controller game.
[10229.40s -> 10230.61s]  You guys ready to chill out?
[10231.17s -> 10236.16s]  Level one.
[10236.16s -> 10241.35s]  You can play Poly Bridge.
[10241.99s -> 10242.85s]  I've heard of it.
[10242.85s -> 10243.25s]  I've seen it.
[10243.89s -> 10245.09s]  Okay.
[10245.09s -> 10246.53s]  Complete all 12 buildings.
[10251.57s -> 10252.53s]  W A S D.
[10254.55s -> 10255.19s]  Click.
[10255.19s -> 10259.14s]  Click.
[10259.14s -> 10261.09s]  Zoom.
[10261.09s -> 10261.49s]  Zoom.
[10262.74s -> 10263.62s]  Hover over the building.
[10263.62s -> 10264.26s]  See what it does.
[10265.65s -> 10266.29s]  Wheat farm.
[10267.54s -> 10269.38s]  Buildings need to be connected to a station.
[10269.38s -> 10274.05s]  Press space bar or the station button to play stations.
[10274.05s -> 10275.81s]  Rotate the station with the scroll wheel.
[10275.81s -> 10276.05s]  Okay.
[10276.61s -> 10283.16s]  So what I want kind of put it like right here.
[10286.72s -> 10287.36s]  Start moving.
[10292.96s -> 10293.60s]  All right.
[10293.60s -> 10306.64s]  What does it want it?
[10306.64s -> 10308.32s]  The mill requires wheat.
[10308.32s -> 10320.44s]  Click on the station connector to build a railroad.
[10320.44s -> 10320.94s]  Oh.
[10324.69s -> 10325.19s]  Oh.
[10333.52s -> 10334.24s]  Ooh.
[10334.24s -> 10336.24s]  And it makes the world look pretty.
[10340.90s -> 10342.55s]  All right.
[10342.55s -> 10343.27s]  You got money.
[10343.27s -> 10345.27s]  Receiving money also unlocks new buildings.
[10345.27s -> 10354.44s]  Hover over the building again to see what it has completed.
[10354.44s -> 10357.24s]  Each wheat farm can supply only one mill.
[10357.24s -> 10361.16s]  So the new wheat farm needs to be connected to a different mill than the one you already used.
[10361.16s -> 10363.38s]  Okay.
[10364.02s -> 10377.43s]  All right.
[10377.43s -> 10377.83s]  Let's go.
[10378.39s -> 10379.94s]  Check this.
[10380.74s -> 10386.34s]  Check it out.
[10386.34s -> 10398.31s]  Wait did it mean oh I needed to connect these two.
[10399.46s -> 10400.82s]  Uh it's fine.
[10400.82s -> 10431.12s]  I'm just seeing what you could do.
[10431.12s -> 10432.48s]  Waste of government funds.
[10433.20s -> 10441.06s]  I did it for fun.
[10441.86s -> 10443.06s]  What are you talking about?
[10443.06s -> 10457.19s]  Start building from this station.
[10457.19s -> 10457.83s]  Okay.
[10457.83s -> 10460.15s]  Tricky terrain ahead.
[10460.15s -> 10463.32s]  Click the highlighted area.
[10463.32s -> 10465.28s]  Yep.
[10465.28s -> 10473.94s]  Not that tricky.
[10473.94s -> 10480.53s]  Please somebody saying please develop this for the switch.
[10480.53s -> 10487.27s]  Yeah this has huge potential to be just fun to make railroads.
[10487.27s -> 10487.91s]  All right.
[10487.91s -> 10489.84s]  The building.
[10489.84s -> 10496.87s]  Check the supply and demand of the new building.
[10496.87s -> 10499.01s]  Needs produces.
[10499.01s -> 10500.37s]  It produces milk.
[10500.37s -> 10501.56s]  What does it need though?
[10501.56s -> 10503.86s]  Nothing.
[10503.86s -> 10507.14s]  This needs milk.
[10507.14s -> 10508.74s]  This needs milk.
[10508.74s -> 10509.94s]  The cheesery.
[10509.94s -> 10510.50s]  Okay.
[10510.50s -> 10512.26s]  So this produces milk.
[10512.26s -> 10513.54s]  This needs milk.
[10513.54s -> 10515.70s]  So let's go for this.
[10515.70s -> 10516.42s]  Ready?
[10516.42s -> 10518.07s]  Is this gonna work?
[10518.07s -> 10542.82s]  So this needs milk.
[10542.82s -> 10560.79s]  Got it.
[10560.79s -> 10563.36s]  Oh shit it just got way harder.
[10563.36s -> 10568.40s]  Buildings can be indirectly connected instead of directly connecting this cheeseery to the
[10568.40s -> 10570.48s]  dairy farm on the other side of the map.
[10570.48s -> 10573.52s]  Or I connected them both to a nearby station on the network.
[10573.52s -> 10598.12s]  Does this count?
[10598.12s -> 10599.68s]  Like can I go like this?
[10599.68s -> 10623.60s]  Does that count?
[10623.60s -> 10626.00s]  Like can I stop here and then go?
[10626.00s -> 10626.88s]  Yeah it works.
[10626.88s -> 10627.84s]  I mean you can do it.
[10627.84s -> 10632.07s]  You can do it.
[10632.07s -> 10632.55s]  Stop.
[10634.95s -> 10636.31s]  I don't even know how the game works.
[10636.31s -> 10638.31s]  I'm just it's literally tutorial.
[10639.04s -> 10640.32s]  Mobile game ad.
[10640.32s -> 10641.44s]  Mobile game ad.
[10641.44s -> 10644.07s]  It's the tutorial.
[10644.07s -> 10648.55s]  It is gonna be a mobile game ad when you're in the tutorial for the game.
[10648.55s -> 10665.89s]  Look at that.
[10665.89s -> 10666.45s]  Cool.
[10666.45s -> 10666.69s]  All right.
[10666.69s -> 10667.81s]  Let's do the next level.
[10667.81s -> 10669.09s]  I like this one a lot.
[10669.09s -> 10680.88s]  Look at that.
[10680.88s -> 10682.45s]  Next level.
[10682.45s -> 10682.85s]  Let's go.
[10682.85s -> 10683.01s]  All right.
[10683.01s -> 10684.13s]  I get it now and it's gonna be fun.
[10684.13s -> 10699.08s]  That's the goal.
[10699.08s -> 10699.64s]  Cheap rails.
[10699.64s -> 10703.01s]  The rails cost half the regular price.
[10703.01s -> 10704.53s]  Bridge price is unchanged.
[10711.35s -> 10712.63s]  I don't think I want to do this right now.
[10713.36s -> 10713.52s]  All right.
[10713.52s -> 10715.28s]  What's the goal?
[10715.28s -> 10717.65s]  I need milk.
[10717.65s -> 10719.33s]  So I got milk milk.
[10719.33s -> 10719.57s]  All right.
[10719.57s -> 10720.93s]  We got two cheeseries.
[10720.93s -> 10723.11s]  Is that what they're called?
[10723.11s -> 10729.06s]  So we got double cheese.
[10732.45s -> 10737.73s]  I'm gonna put this one here in case I need to go bridge up this way.
[10737.73s -> 10738.93s]  So let's go like this.
[10740.92s -> 10742.12s]  Aim it like that.
[10742.12s -> 10745.06s]  Like that.
[10745.06s -> 10745.30s]  Okay.
[10745.94s -> 10748.34s]  So then we need a connection from here to here.
[10748.34s -> 10752.44s]  And then a connection from here to here.
[10753.24s -> 10755.40s]  Let's make it smooth and not like shit.
[10755.96s -> 10763.75s]  I might have to come down here with the other track.
[10764.39s -> 10772.16s]  Here we go.
[10772.16s -> 10772.80s]  Done.
[10772.80s -> 10775.72s]  Give us some new stuff.
[10775.72s -> 10779.91s]  New cards.
[10779.91s -> 10781.11s]  I click to draw cards.
[10781.83s -> 10783.97s]  You get a hand.
[10784.53s -> 10791.51s]  When are you gonna play Fortnite creative mode?
[10792.63s -> 10799.01s]  The only time I've ever played Fortnite for real was during the tournament that Ludwig did.
[10799.57s -> 10802.05s]  And then I said I'll never play it ever again after that.
[10802.05s -> 10802.69s]  Ever.
[10802.69s -> 10809.76s]  Yeah.
[10809.76s -> 10810.56s]  I saw the clip.
[10810.56s -> 10815.52s]  I saw the clip of Myth and Ludwig just laughing their asses off at my game flight.
[10815.52s -> 10817.92s]  They got like 60 million views, by the way.
[10817.92s -> 10821.81s]  I can never return to that game.
[10825.33s -> 10829.33s]  All right.
[10829.33s -> 10829.81s]  What is this?
[10831.89s -> 10832.37s]  Flour.
[10833.30s -> 10834.02s]  This makes bread.
[10834.02s -> 10834.74s]  So I need flour.
[10834.74s -> 10836.34s]  Where's the flour production facility?
[10836.98s -> 10839.24s]  This makes flour.
[10839.88s -> 10842.79s]  So starting here.
[10842.79s -> 10846.00s]  I'm gonna go up bridge mode this way.
[10846.64s -> 10848.52s]  Because this needs wheat.
[10849.24s -> 10850.84s]  So we need to go this way.
[10851.56s -> 10851.96s]  Bridge.
[10852.60s -> 10853.16s]  Expensive.
[10853.16s -> 10854.68s]  But, you know, I think it's worth it.
[10855.24s -> 10857.08s]  And then that could connect to here.
[10857.80s -> 10860.60s]  Because then the flour can come back through here and make the bread.
[10860.60s -> 10861.46s]  What are you?
[10861.46s -> 10861.70s]  Dumb?
[10871.68s -> 10872.72s]  All right.
[10872.72s -> 10877.19s]  Now we need to go from producers wheat to flour.
[10884.42s -> 10884.98s]  Looks good.
[10885.94s -> 10887.30s]  And then we come back this way.
[10889.49s -> 10889.73s]  Right?
[10890.53s -> 10894.42s]  Through here.
[10897.56s -> 10897.96s]  Bingo.
[10898.60s -> 10912.76s]  And then press tab or hover over the complete level button to highlight.
[10913.40s -> 10914.04s]  Wait, what is it?
[10914.04s -> 10914.60s]  Highlight.
[10914.60s -> 10915.72s]  Oh, incomplete buildings.
[10916.28s -> 10919.25s]  Wait, what's wrong here?
[10921.11s -> 10922.47s]  Oh, this is making cheese.
[10924.07s -> 10926.47s]  This is probably like a cheese steak factory or something, right?
[10927.20s -> 10927.44s]  All right.
[10927.44s -> 10928.32s]  They want cheese.
[10928.32s -> 10944.66s]  They want everything.
[10944.66s -> 10945.22s]  Okay.
[10945.22s -> 10948.66s]  So the city needs bread, milk, and cheese.
[10948.66s -> 10950.71s]  The bread is here.
[10950.71s -> 10953.80s]  So this is making bread.
[10953.80s -> 10955.56s]  I'm going to have it come back this way.
[10955.56s -> 10956.44s]  Let's just double it up.
[10957.00s -> 10961.62s]  This is going to connect.
[10962.18s -> 10962.82s]  Double it up.
[10964.07s -> 10971.89s]  No, this is getting bread.
[10974.96s -> 10975.76s]  So this is making.
[10975.76s -> 10976.64s]  We need to make milk.
[10979.89s -> 10984.34s]  Double it up.
[10984.34s -> 10986.26s]  Does anybody need more milk?
[10986.26s -> 10987.54s]  I mean, they do.
[10988.18s -> 10989.30s]  I don't think anybody else needs it.
[10990.76s -> 10992.20s]  No other like cheese building.
[10992.84s -> 10995.86s]  This one's pretty easy.
[10999.91s -> 11002.61s]  Wait, how do I get the cheese over here?
[11003.17s -> 11004.96s]  Oh, like this.
[11004.96s -> 11015.36s]  I didn't even spend any of these yet.
[11015.36s -> 11018.36s]  What about city skylines too?
[11018.36s -> 11025.54s]  Oh, you better believe it.
[11025.54s -> 11027.78s]  He is not going to play sorcery.
[11027.78s -> 11028.58s]  Yes, I am.
[11028.58s -> 11029.89s]  What time is it?
[11029.89s -> 11041.64s]  Oh, shit.
[11041.64s -> 11042.77s]  Okay.
[11042.77s -> 11051.30s]  This needs everything.
[11051.30s -> 11052.34s]  Milk can come up here.
[11052.34s -> 11052.58s]  All right.
[11052.58s -> 11054.02s]  We're going to do cheap bridges.
[11054.02s -> 11058.80s]  How do I activate it?
[11058.80s -> 11076.95s]  Do I even wait?
[11076.95s -> 11081.28s]  Milk coming up here.
[11081.28s -> 11082.37s]  Cheap bridges.
[11082.37s -> 11083.97s]  Yeah, I want a cheap bridge.
[11083.97s -> 11088.24s]  Look at that.
[11088.24s -> 11092.24s]  Cheese is going up here.
[11092.24s -> 11093.12s]  Milk heading this way.
[11093.12s -> 11093.52s]  Cheese.
[11093.52s -> 11097.36s]  And now I need to make bread connection.
[11097.36s -> 11101.40s]  Bakery is making bread.
[11101.40s -> 11110.85s]  Cheap bridges.
[11110.85s -> 11111.41s]  Oh, shit.
[11111.41s -> 11111.89s]  Wait.
[11111.89s -> 11122.85s]  Well, it looks nicer.
[11122.85s -> 11123.33s]  It's fine.
[11123.33s -> 11124.95s]  I mean, lies of J.
[11124.95s -> 11125.43s]  Lies of J.
[11125.43s -> 11126.15s]  What do you mean?
[11126.15s -> 11128.96s]  I'm going to play sorcery.
[11128.96s -> 11130.64s]  I'm still having fun in the demos.
[11130.64s -> 11132.74s]  I've been live for three hours.
[11132.74s -> 11133.38s]  It's not.
[11133.38s -> 11133.94s]  It's not.
[11133.94s -> 11135.70s]  I've been having my life for like eight hours.
[11135.70s -> 11157.83s]  This still needs bread.
[11157.83s -> 11160.32s]  Wait.
[11160.32s -> 11161.84s]  Oh, I have to go here.
[11161.84s -> 11162.40s]  Okay.
[11162.40s -> 11181.80s]  I don't need money.
[11181.80s -> 11188.21s]  I did it.
[11188.21s -> 11188.53s]  Yeah.
[11189.17s -> 11202.02s]  I almost had it.
[11202.02s -> 11202.58s]  All right.
[11202.58s -> 11207.35s]  Let's do another one.
[11207.35s -> 11212.02s]  This was called station to say station.
[11212.02s -> 11215.97s]  Station to station.
[11215.97s -> 11217.09s]  I liked it.
[11217.09s -> 11220.31s]  Let's do another one.
[11220.31s -> 11227.91s]  How about legendary hoplite?
[11227.91s -> 11231.43s]  And then we'll move to sorcery after this.
[11231.43s -> 11245.01s]  Play viewfinder.
[11245.01s -> 11246.37s]  I actually have that one up here too.
[11246.37s -> 11253.06s]  That was a good one.
[11253.06s -> 11259.52s]  All right.
[11259.52s -> 11261.36s]  Viewfinder or legendary hoplite?
[11261.36s -> 11263.99s]  Which one?
[11263.99s -> 11264.79s]  Viewfinder.
[11264.79s -> 11270.90s]  Try viewfinder.
[11270.90s -> 11287.36s]  Graphics.
[11287.36s -> 11291.70s]  Okay.
[11294.08s -> 11296.37s]  A little bit.
[11296.37s -> 11309.60s]  Start demo.
[11309.60s -> 11310.40s]  Great.
[11310.40s -> 11311.57s]  We're in.
[11311.57s -> 11312.93s]  Time to explore.
[11312.93s -> 11314.23s]  Okay.
[11314.23s -> 11314.79s]  Wait.
[11314.79s -> 11322.13s]  Way too high.
[11322.13s -> 11322.85s]  Time to explore.
[11322.85s -> 11323.57s]  What we got?
[11323.57s -> 11324.77s]  Coffee can.
[11324.77s -> 11340.80s]  It's a very pretty game.
[11340.80s -> 11341.44s]  Coding.
[11341.44s -> 11344.84s]  There's no time to talk like the present.
[11344.84s -> 11346.13s]  You can build anything.
[11346.13s -> 11347.65s]  Yet you start to build a lab.
[11348.96s -> 11352.24s]  I'm afraid the butter flavor is a work in progress.
[11352.24s -> 11357.67s]  We're coding pillows to watch the footage popcorn next.
[11357.67s -> 11361.27s]  To think all the wonders of the world can be doubled with
[11361.27s -> 11363.83s]  as long as you build the right space.
[11364.71s -> 11367.67s]  Whether Hiraya wants to admit it or not,
[11367.67s -> 11370.15s]  Mirren is truly brilliant.
[11370.87s -> 11372.63s]  Now how do I get out of here?
[11372.79s -> 11373.29s]  Hmm.
[11375.43s -> 11376.71s]  What is this place?
[11377.43s -> 11377.93s]  Ooh.
[11378.55s -> 11381.67s]  I've never seen this much overgrowth before.
[11382.63s -> 11383.13s]  It's...
[11384.39s -> 11384.89s]  Sky!
[11385.35s -> 11386.31s]  Whoa, you okay?
[11387.83s -> 11389.19s]  Uh, your vials look good.
[11390.64s -> 11393.76s]  I guess we know now that falling doesn't hurt.
[11394.64s -> 11396.08s]  That's some good news at least.
[11407.54s -> 11409.78s]  There must be a way to get back up there.
[11409.78s -> 11410.28s]  What?
[11414.44s -> 11416.04s]  I took way too long.
[11416.04s -> 11417.00s]  Did I run out of time?
[11418.29s -> 11419.41s]  You're what? That's sick!
[11434.20s -> 11435.96s]  I didn't want to do the whole demo again.
[11443.86s -> 11447.46s]  To think all the wonders of the world can be doubled with
[11447.46s -> 11450.18s]  as long as you build the right space.
[11450.18s -> 11450.68s]  Okay.
[11450.90s -> 11453.54s]  Whether Hiraya wants to admit it or not,
[11453.54s -> 11454.98s]  Mirren is truly brilliant.
[11454.98s -> 11455.48s]  I'm fine.
[11460.08s -> 11461.36s]  What's an old photograph doing here?
[11461.36s -> 11463.12s]  Do not double tap R.
[11464.00s -> 11465.86s]  I'm telling you, it takes you to the very beginning.
[11470.74s -> 11472.02s]  What the fuck just happened?
[11472.02s -> 11473.54s]  Whoa, okay, that's kind of cool.
[11475.17s -> 11478.45s]  Did, hang on, did you just shift reality?
[11479.17s -> 11480.87s]  A teleporter!
[11481.59s -> 11486.55s]  Glad you made it in one piece.
[11488.16s -> 11490.88s]  Hmm, interesting.
[11517.97s -> 11518.77s]  Gonna power it!
[11521.57s -> 11522.45s]  How do I power this?
[11527.41s -> 11529.81s]  Is this technically traditional?
[11529.81s -> 11530.53s]  It's two batteries.
[11530.53s -> 11532.37s]  Have you charged one?
[11532.37s -> 11533.41s]  Enough questions.
[11533.41s -> 11534.45s]  Stop moving.
[11534.45s -> 11534.95s]  Smile.
[11535.81s -> 11546.55s]  That was pretty cool.
[11548.10s -> 11549.70s]  I thought outside the box big time.
[11561.11s -> 11562.31s]  It's almost working.
[11563.03s -> 11564.39s]  Looks like we need one more.
[11565.19s -> 11568.29s]  Yeah, just hold the thing upside down.
[11568.29s -> 11569.57s]  Just let all the shit fall out.
[11573.91s -> 11583.33s]  I wasn't smart, it was just lazy.
[11585.76s -> 11586.40s]  I feel like it's...
[11601.78s -> 11604.10s]  Oh shit, maybe that was not a good idea.
[11604.82s -> 11617.09s]  What direction am I falling?
[11631.68s -> 11633.04s]  This is really, really neat.
[11637.68s -> 11639.12s]  Uh, looks fine like that.
[11647.51s -> 11648.39s]  Just one?
[11648.39s -> 11650.93s]  I should just put it upside down.
[11650.93s -> 11654.64s]  How do they even do this?
[11656.82s -> 11663.35s]  There is a, there's a coder who probably has spent a very long time
[11663.35s -> 11664.95s]  tediously making this possible.
[11665.67s -> 11682.76s]  They just made that up.
[11683.32s -> 11685.59s]  Made it up.
[11688.71s -> 11690.77s]  Wait, it wants me to make a bridge.
[11697.03s -> 11699.33s]  I was just curious what happened.
[11704.53s -> 11705.41s]  Made it up.
[11705.41s -> 11709.22s]  Close enough.
[11709.22s -> 11717.88s]  Uh, there's some programmer right now that's sitting there saying
[11717.88s -> 11723.56s]  you chat motherfuckers have no idea how difficult this was to do.
[11735.03s -> 11735.91s]  Actually, cool.
[11735.91s -> 11745.86s]  Okay.
[11745.86s -> 11746.42s]  Chill, bro.
[11748.50s -> 11749.22s]  Well, I'm...
[11749.22s -> 11749.78s]  That's what I would be saying.
[11749.78s -> 11751.54s]  Maybe there's a surface you can use to climb up there.
[11758.69s -> 11761.96s]  I need, I need to understand.
[11761.96s -> 11763.32s]  Climb the surface?
[11763.32s -> 11764.60s]  Beautiful as it is.
[11764.60s -> 11765.16s]  Whoa.
[11765.16s -> 11767.08s]  Carries so much weight.
[11767.96s -> 11769.56s]  There is promise here.
[11769.64s -> 11773.00s]  Promise of a future we can surely achieve.
[11773.80s -> 11778.20s]  Even now, I'm striving to reach heights I never thought possible.
[11779.24s -> 11783.72s]  All that I hope is that, that everything we do here continues...
[11783.72s -> 11785.48s]  Ah, it shows you where the other ones are too.
[11785.48s -> 11786.60s]  ...up there as well.
[11786.60s -> 11787.78s]  For our sake.
[11788.50s -> 11789.54s]  For Miren's sake.
[11790.18s -> 11792.45s]  Climb this?
[11792.45s -> 11793.33s]  Wait, I'm confused.
[11794.21s -> 11803.32s]  There we go.
[11803.32s -> 11814.45s]  Is this game out?
[11815.09s -> 11816.15s]  When does this one come out?
[11816.15s -> 11816.95s]  Because this one's really fun.
[11824.08s -> 11824.56s]  July?
[11825.20s -> 11826.64s]  Three weeks?
[11827.12s -> 11828.16s]  Okay, remind me to play this.
[11848.26s -> 11848.90s]  What's happening?
[11853.00s -> 11868.00s]  All right, I need to go back.
[11868.00s -> 11869.36s]  How do I get back to where I was?
[11869.36s -> 11881.08s]  Oh, shit.
[11882.04s -> 11898.95s]  I'm back.
[11898.95s -> 11899.43s]  I'm fine.
[11900.07s -> 11902.18s]  But your nose...
[11903.38s -> 11904.56s]  I'm bleeding nose.
[11904.56s -> 11905.12s]  News bleeding.
[11906.47s -> 11906.95s]  I'm fine.
[11906.95s -> 11907.35s]  I'm fine.
[11925.03s -> 11925.67s]  Oh, hold on.
[11925.67s -> 11928.15s]  Let me put my middle finger up and put it under my nose.
[11929.43s -> 11929.99s]  My god.
[11930.47s -> 11934.36s]  This is a way better way to reveal that.
[11934.92s -> 11936.04s]  Have the blood come out of their eyes.
[11936.60s -> 11938.87s]  Nobody does that though.
[11938.87s -> 11962.02s]  Plus two, that changed my mind.
[11962.02s -> 11962.52s]  Good.
[11962.90s -> 11966.52s]  This one's a little different.
[11991.00s -> 11992.12s]  Can I actually go into this one?
[11992.92s -> 12002.60s]  Sorry, the edible hit right when I saw this one.
[12010.15s -> 12011.67s]  That's pretty magical though, I'll say.
[12020.47s -> 12020.97s]  What?
[12023.35s -> 12027.74s]  Cool.
[12045.03s -> 12050.84s]  I like how each one has a backdrop.
[12051.40s -> 12056.98s]  It's a nice touch.
[12057.70s -> 12059.59s]  Can I go in?
[12060.39s -> 12066.61s]  Like a dungeon?
[12090.31s -> 12091.67s]  My mouth is open.
[12091.67s -> 12092.95s]  I just want to make sure you know that.
[12106.36s -> 12106.86s]  Cool.
[12107.80s -> 12109.11s]  Did I miss a picture?
[12109.83s -> 12112.49s]  Wait.
[12126.85s -> 12127.35s]  Ah.
[12127.97s -> 12130.07s]  All right, let's fuck this whole thing up.
[12134.58s -> 12135.54s]  That wasn't gonna...
[12136.18s -> 12136.68s]  Okay.
[12148.52s -> 12149.02s]  Shit.
[12157.46s -> 12158.10s]  Hey, good one.
[12158.66s -> 12159.97s]  It was all right.
[12163.73s -> 12164.69s]  Wait, the demo's over?
[12167.78s -> 12168.66s]  Take a photo?
[12169.22s -> 12171.86s]  I gotta get this lined up.
[12178.84s -> 12180.44s]  That's how you take a photo right there.
[12180.44s -> 12182.68s]  That's how you take a pristine photo.
[12183.32s -> 12183.82s]  All right.
[12192.68s -> 12193.72s]  This is fucked.
[12203.16s -> 12203.66s]  Oh.
[12203.96s -> 12208.22s]  I'm all right.
[12208.76s -> 12235.19s]  All right, I gotta go all the way back.
[12235.19s -> 12236.55s]  I really like this one.
[12236.55s -> 12238.15s]  All right, this is a cool game.
[12238.15s -> 12239.99s]  I'm playing it on launch day.
[12259.46s -> 12261.06s]  You get five charges on the camera.
[12261.70s -> 12264.42s]  All right, so this is what they want me to do.
[12264.42s -> 12265.78s]  They want you to take a picture like this.
[12267.14s -> 12268.26s]  And then flip it around.
[12268.98s -> 12269.48s]  Like that.
[12278.90s -> 12279.70s]  Very nice.
[12282.58s -> 12283.08s]  Ah.
[12284.02s -> 12284.66s]  I get it.
[12286.72s -> 12288.16s]  And then I gotta go over here.
[12288.96s -> 12300.95s]  Some of these are gonna get way too big brained for me.
[12300.95s -> 12303.17s]  But it's cool nonetheless.
[12303.73s -> 12311.44s]  All right, so let's go.
[12312.24s -> 12318.08s]  Upside down strat works pretty well here.
[12318.64s -> 12335.64s]  How many do I need?
[12335.64s -> 12346.95s]  Probably three?
[12346.95s -> 12347.45s]  Let's see.
[12347.91s -> 12354.50s]  I might need a screwdriver.
[12354.50s -> 12366.63s]  Hey dude, we need...
[12366.63s -> 12367.27s]  Oh, it's only two.
[12367.27s -> 12367.77s]  Okay.
[12378.20s -> 12379.00s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[12379.00s -> 12379.96s]  Go back and spin it.
[12379.96s -> 12381.48s]  Wait, can I flip it around?
[12381.48s -> 12385.96s]  Wait, hold on.
[12385.96s -> 12389.97s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12389.97s -> 12391.01s]  What if I go like this?
[12391.01s -> 12396.60s]  Does this fucking do anything?
[12396.60s -> 12398.68s]  It does.
[12398.68s -> 12400.36s]  All right, it does, it does, it does.
[12400.36s -> 12401.24s]  We're good now.
[12401.24s -> 12407.25s]  Is that an account?
[12408.68s -> 12426.40s]  Oh, wait.
[12426.40s -> 12427.52s]  Oh, it's over.
[12431.14s -> 12434.32s]  Oh, it's over.
[12434.32s -> 12441.83s]  Yeah, I'm playing this day one.
[12441.83s -> 12442.77s]  This is great.
[12443.33s -> 12449.46s]  That might be the highlight of the whole day so far.
[12450.10s -> 12451.38s]  And they've all been good.
[12451.38s -> 12455.78s]  I've enjoyed each one of them.
[12455.78s -> 12459.25s]  All right, I think it's time to take a break.
[12459.25s -> 12460.45s]  Come back, play some Sorcery.
[12462.10s -> 12463.62s]  Those of you that don't know what Sorcery is,
[12464.92s -> 12466.44s]  we have a lot of catching up to do.
[12466.44s -> 12468.92s]  I'm going to do my best to spend 10 seconds telling you what it is.
[12469.56s -> 12473.27s]  I'll do some more NexFest.
[12473.27s -> 12475.11s]  Well, wait, when is it done?
[12475.11s -> 12476.24s]  When's it done, done?
[12476.24s -> 12484.87s]  A couple of days, right?
[12484.87s -> 12492.28s]  Oh, because I want to play Final Fantasy 16 and just kind of hang out.
[12492.28s -> 12498.10s]  Maybe we'll shoot for Monday?
[12498.10s -> 12502.90s]  Is it over Monday or is it Monday all day and over technically on the 27th?
