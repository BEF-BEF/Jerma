[12.73s -> 17.00s]  Okay, so let's I'm gonna go over the rules of this challenge
[17.08s -> 32.38s]  This is super punch out and this is gonna go as follows. No, no knockdowns
[32.62s -> 42.69s]  Let's see if I can do it. We don't need to bet. Can I do this with no knockdowns for me?
[42.79s -> 50.10s]  No TKOs or no knockdowns at all. That's gonna be really hard, but we'll see
[53.03s -> 67.12s]  All right, you ready? I got it up right here. All right, so super punch out is one of my favorite games
[67.76s -> 74.39s]  Pretty much ever. I'd say it's in the top 20 top 10. Mmm, maybe top 20. I
[76.16s -> 80.60s]  Gotta remember how the controls button setting mode. Hold on
[80.84s -> 89.34s]  All right B is right punch left punches Y and then a is the knockout punch power up is yeah, that's fine
[89.58s -> 99.09s]  Okay, that's all I need a is the big punch you guys ready? No
[100.09s -> 104.13s]  Knockdowns. What's the penalty if I fail every time I get knocked down I
[105.88s -> 113.99s]  For every time I get knocked down what's a good thing to put here? I'm gonna say this game sucks. It does not come on
[121.89s -> 125.62s]  Every time you get knocked down one stream of tears of the kingdom. Oh
[127.98s -> 137.03s]  No, no, I don't think so it's not that I don't want to do that
[137.03s -> 142.23s]  I don't want to give people the idea that if let's say I just am completely wrong and I'm just really rusting
[142.23s -> 144.77s]  I can't do this if I get knocked down ten times
[144.93s -> 155.96s]  I didn't even stream breath of the wild ten times every five knockdowns. You need to do that
[157.06s -> 163.30s]  Do you hate Zelda? No, I just I just don't never was really into the franchise really
[164.02s -> 166.74s]  Like I said, that's the first time I played Zelda since Ocarina of Time
[167.02s -> 176.26s]  Just kind of let it all pass by me for some reason. All right
[176.26s -> 181.62s]  Well, it's not gonna happen here so we can figure it out. It's just I'm I might not even get hurt here
[181.62s -> 229.74s]  Okay, good. Yay fall down. Oh, come on. Oh fuck. I forgot. That's what that move did
[229.74s -> 242.10s]  I thought I had an extra second. I thought I had an extra second. He's not getting up. Don't worry
[242.98s -> 249.58s]  We're good. It's knockdowns not taking damage. I got hit by Gabby J, but it's okay
[249.78s -> 266.77s]  That's not a knockdown who's after Gabby J. It's that's from when I played with me. All right. Yeah
[267.29s -> 275.96s]  Bear hugger. No punching is a great rule. What?
[278.37s -> 311.38s]  Okay, could I had it full health play the Wii one? I did a long time ago
[311.38s -> 314.22s]  I want to say like a few years like three four years ago. Whoa
[314.96s -> 319.50s]  At why well, it's happening. Okay, there we go
[320.22s -> 341.26s]  Bear hugger really showed up and nothing but overalls. Yeah, do you think they'll ever do another punch-out game?
[341.26s -> 347.74s]  Cuz we got a punch-out Wii and then they kind of just didn't really ever do it again
[348.26s -> 360.96s]  All right. I have to remember the pattern here
[361.80s -> 367.40s]  Because you can get caught and I think it's either it starts up or it starts down and I don't remember
[367.40s -> 369.58s]  I might take a little bit damage here
[369.74s -> 389.11s]  I actually might put on the other controller for this because the d-pad is on this thing stinks
[389.11s -> 422.56s]  I thought I almost had it in one hit sit down. Yes. How did this guy not beat Ganon?
[422.56s -> 431.29s]  Oh, you said I did you say beat Ganon or not beat Ganon? Is the game easy?
[431.81s -> 438.31s]  Not the first circuit kind of is but this is where it heats up a little
[439.25s -> 446.43s]  The game is actually it's about just patterns and memorization. See I just remember every single thing that these guys do
[446.43s -> 464.60s]  I have to catch it because otherwise you die in one hit. Can I catch it? What do you guys think?
[465.00s -> 478.75s]  He charges at you and he'll kill you in one swing. I don't know follow your heart
[479.15s -> 498.50s]  We might not even have to we might not even see it. Hold on. There it is. Fuck
[499.50s -> 501.50s]  I just ripped up my fucking power cable
[506.50s -> 515.61s]  Challenge is over. I ripped it. Hold on a second. I was a little late
[523.78s -> 530.44s]  Too bad I got cocky you don't have to do that, but I just got really cocky. It's okay
[537.29s -> 539.29s]  See you have to do this
[539.29s -> 548.79s]  You do have to catch him though. Maybe no, actually. Yeah, I got cocky. That's my own fault. I just want to that's one
[548.79s -> 558.61s]  Tears of the kingdom stream. No, I didn't agree to that. Damn it
[558.61s -> 570.72s]  I was thinking I was gonna get through that without getting knocked down once the other
[570.92s -> 579.08s]  Germa beat it three seconds faster than I did. I did better than I did before though
[580.75s -> 594.24s]  All right circuit to this is
[594.24s -> 598.33s]  Charlie there's who else is in this? Where's the clown? The clown is really hard
[598.33s -> 616.31s]  I shouldn't even be alternating swinging actually to the gut so far so good. Oh, all right
[616.31s -> 647.09s]  This is I remember this he goes this way. There you go. See you later. Got a quick. Oh
[651.60s -> 661.57s]  All right, that's that's pretty rare. Almost 30 seconds. That's pretty good
[662.09s -> 666.65s]  31 99 that's way faster than I did it before
[671.55s -> 685.52s]  Look at a minute 30 from when I did it last time forget what this guy does. He's just like a kick
[685.52s -> 698.52s]  There's like two or three kicks you have to be aware about the timing on this guy's kind of weird, too. Ah
[699.16s -> 725.55s]  Shit, that's my fault. He's a heel. Oh, it's down. It's down. Yep. Got it
[726.75s -> 742.54s]  That'll kill you in one hit by the way. I'm not being efficient either. I should be way more efficient than this
[743.18s -> 750.52s]  This is sloppy. I should be hitting him
[755.39s -> 761.64s]  Two or three times before it as you can hit him up to a certain amount of times when you do that like one two
[761.64s -> 764.84s]  Three four, okay, so do three one two, three swing
[765.64s -> 769.80s]  Whoa, that was close. He really is go to the games with two buttons
[769.80s -> 789.80s]  I told you just give me three buttons in a directional and I got it better than before
[790.12s -> 792.30s]  All right, this guy there's nothing flashy
[793.34s -> 811.96s]  Uh, he just has a ton of health and he hurts a lot and his timings are a little weighty spits in your face, too
[811.96s -> 815.64s]  I think it's you have to do down. Let's try it. Yep. Spit. Got it
[816.20s -> 842.35s]  It is funny how that happens, huh? Oh, no, don't sit. Don't talk now try to catch him there. Oh
[842.91s -> 844.91s]  Don't be silly
[844.99s -> 846.91s]  Don't be silly about this
[846.91s -> 849.55s]  Oh, and the d-pad fucked up. Nice
[850.19s -> 868.32s]  No downs, that's the hell second circuit. I'm even i'm eating frozen grapes right now. They're goaded
[868.88s -> 887.26s]  They are so good. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it
[887.82s -> 897.71s]  I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna go for it
[898.59s -> 909.26s]  I'm even i'm eating frozen grapes right now. They're goaded
[911.88s -> 913.88s]  They are so delicious. Honestly
[914.28s -> 916.28s]  I actually uh, holly and I tried the
[916.76s -> 924.20s]  Frozen blueberries that a lot of people are talking about. They're up there too and no joking around
[924.84s -> 930.36s]  I actually really do mean this if you're actually having trouble getting fruits and vegetables into your diet
[932.22s -> 938.04s]  It's a it's a great way to do it frozen blueberries and frozen grapes seedless
[938.52s -> 947.66s]  Red grapes, by the way, I look forward to eating these. It's not like oh, yeah
[947.74s -> 952.78s]  Like I I have to eat vegetables and fruits about it. I eat like a pizza today
[952.78s -> 957.47s]  Did I even eat anything good for me? Oh, I got frozen blueberries and frozen grapes in the freezer
[958.19s -> 960.27s]  You they're like a little treat. You look forward to eating them
[961.15s -> 965.28s]  It's a really good way to get some um extra fruits in your diet. Seriously
[968.16s -> 970.32s]  Yeah, and when they come out of the okay, this one's gonna be hard but
[970.96s -> 972.96s]  Uh when they come out of the freezer
[973.56s -> 977.08s]  Don't just just chomp on them. Let them sit out for a minute or two
[977.16s -> 979.16s]  Let them get a little bit softer on the outside
[979.32s -> 980.60s]  I don't know. Maybe you like it like that
[980.60s -> 987.23s]  I I like it kind of frozen but just don't bite into them. It's like a popsicle. I forget what this guy does
[987.95s -> 998.60s]  I have to stop talking. Yeah, he does the triple. That's what it is. Okay
[999.80s -> 1021.87s]  Okay, that usually kills you i'm good
[1038.96s -> 1040.24s]  Damn it
[1040.24s -> 1061.96s]  I thought he did it twice one more hour of tears of the kingdom. Yep. That thing is brutal by the way
[1071.88s -> 1086.80s]  How come I can't block what's going on with that? Usually you can block up. Come on, man
[1088.65s -> 1098.62s]  What the fuck
[1098.62s -> 1102.38s]  All right, the d-pad on the pro controller really is like an absolute piece of shit
[1103.80s -> 1123.16s]  It's one gigantic button that when you press left you press all the buttons at the same time use the joy cons
[1123.24s -> 1127.47s]  I actually yeah, that's a good idea
[1128.36s -> 1133.15s]  No, I think i'll be fine way worse than the other jeremy by the way
[1134.92s -> 1137.87s]  All right. Well, that's all right. It's two downs
[1143.42s -> 1145.98s]  No losses though, which are good because I want to
[1146.54s -> 1148.54s]  Hopefully do no losses
[1148.86s -> 1160.20s]  Okay, aaron ryan, this is this guy has it's all about the lower blocking
[1161.16s -> 1174.27s]  He's gonna grab
[1175.23s -> 1176.43s]  Shit
[1176.43s -> 1200.01s]  You can usually catch him right there. Come on, dude. Here it comes. Okay, I got it
[1201.53s -> 1213.52s]  Whoa, you're still going
[1213.52s -> 1215.12s]  Cool, we're good
[1215.12s -> 1278.65s]  All right. Let me get some help back almost had it again. It starts it up. I think come on
[1279.29s -> 1290.60s]  Right. Yeah, this is it. No
[1296.54s -> 1297.58s]  Shit
[1297.58s -> 1314.09s]  Sit down
[1314.09s -> 1316.46s]  three tears of the kingdom
[1317.18s -> 1318.88s]  minutes
[1318.88s -> 1322.99s]  Looking at it on the nintendo shop store page and you believe it
[1332.14s -> 1341.77s]  That's actually I think the harder of all the ones in this final circuit something with the hair is a hair flip
[1342.17s -> 1348.54s]  There's a hair flip. I forget which I forget which side it's on. I think it's a hair flip on the left side, I think
[1349.34s -> 1371.88s]  Find out
[1371.88s -> 1377.61s]  Good. It's a good start. I got full health. I'm good
[1381.63s -> 1384.19s]  Oh that was started early, okay, which side is it on?
[1384.91s -> 1388.11s]  I think it's okay. It's left and then it's down. That's what it is. I got it
[1405.20s -> 1421.58s]  All right, get some help. Whoo
[1422.22s -> 1443.12s]  See you later. I did it. All right. We're almost there only two more. That was pretty good. That was clean
[1443.52s -> 1448.24s]  Not as clean as uh, uh
[1450.89s -> 1452.62s]  Here's the clown
[1452.62s -> 1466.72s]  All right clown does this just move with the balls. So it's a bear hugger skin, but forget some things
[1467.28s -> 1474.56s]  Yep, it's that other way. They trick you. That's a one-hit kill by the way. Good start
[1475.60s -> 1506.40s]  Whoo
[1506.40s -> 1512.67s]  How fast is the speed run? It's probably ridiculous. Where did that come from?
[1523.53s -> 1537.53s]  All right. Well, we did it. No doubts. Would you fight a 400 pound clown in real life if I had to?
[1538.09s -> 1552.38s]  That was way better than the last time I played it. Okay, uh, this is the last boss of the game
[1553.42s -> 1554.70s]  uh
[1554.70s -> 1556.22s]  technically
[1557.18s -> 1558.86s]  This guy
[1558.86s -> 1564.52s]  Has a bunch of really awful stuff. I don't know if i'll do it, but i'll try he has this
[1565.26s -> 1585.68s]  Spin overhead swing move. They have to duck under like three times. Hi
[1588.78s -> 1619.72s]  There it is. Okay when he goes i'm out of rhythm. I thought he was gonna spin shit
[1622.41s -> 1623.85s]  Oh
[1623.85s -> 1637.31s]  No, I got it. I got it. This guy sucks. He does a little hop too. It's awful
[1661.08s -> 1670.14s]  Oh, that's it. Can you tell how frequently i've gotten to the end here? We're doing this by the way
[1670.38s -> 1686.64s]  It's rewinding. Is it block? How do you do that? Let me see. Is it I think it's just block up
[1687.82s -> 1690.06s]  Maybe it is just up. Let me see you do it again
[1691.26s -> 1692.06s]  No
[1692.06s -> 1715.76s]  Sometimes he does it three times. Damn it. Yeah, it's already over. I I couldn't beat the final boss and without being down
[1715.84s -> 1717.84s]  It's over fine. I don't care
[1718.75s -> 1720.75s]  This guy is very hard
[1727.37s -> 1728.25s]  Shit
[1728.25s -> 1739.53s]  It's so funny. You can see you can just tell when you just get so full just so out
[1739.61s -> 1748.00s]  This is a rhythm game and it's very hard look at how much i'm getting hit right now
[1748.16s -> 1752.08s]  This i've taken more punches in the last 10 seconds than the last 40 minutes playing this game
[1752.24s -> 1779.76s]  It's just a rhythm game. It's like playing rhythm heaven. It's that little left jab or right jab. It's just
[1789.60s -> 1794.43s]  All right. How do I block that? Maybe just don't move. That's what it is. Okay, you just don't move
[1804.12s -> 1807.20s]  shit
[1811.18s -> 1817.61s]  All right, so the reason why I did that because if you lose if you actually get a loss
[1818.43s -> 1823.55s]  Uh, you are 100% locked out of doing the final circuit ever
[1824.03s -> 1826.03s]  You have to do you have to beat every single
[1826.43s -> 1832.86s]  Uh enemy you have to do every single fight without losing the only way you can get the last actual
[1833.34s -> 1838.32s]  Um circuit. Oh my god. That was really bad from the last time
[1843.92s -> 1845.92s]  So now special circuit is open
[1848.97s -> 1853.85s]  Now the reason why I said I could get to here without being downed. Yeah
[1856.54s -> 1860.30s]  Really age well when I said that because that's uh, that didn't happen
[1860.88s -> 1865.44s]  Okay, so uh, but I get to do this now and this is impossible this is actually like almost impossible
[1865.44s -> 1868.48s]  This is very very very hard. Actually when I was a kid
[1869.29s -> 1877.02s]  Uh, I only saw this one time i've never actually truly played through this part except I did
[1878.32s -> 1880.64s]  In more recent years, but when I was younger and I played this all the time
[1880.64s -> 1884.44s]  I it was it was rare to even get here because remember I didn't have a safe state
[1885.72s -> 1895.60s]  I do remember this is a really cool fight though, because you'll see watch this
[1895.92s -> 1899.66s]  He doesn't want you to do something very in particular
[1900.22s -> 1906.17s]  You can't hit him in the face until he gets angry
[1907.18s -> 1909.24s]  and he loses composure
[1909.24s -> 1910.28s]  and he
[1910.28s -> 1912.92s]  and gets mad at uh calamity ganon and uh
[1913.64s -> 1922.96s]  You will see
[1922.96s -> 1926.48s]  Yeah, my experience with this guy is I think i've seen this guy twice ever
[1928.36s -> 1930.60s]  Let's do it. I mean if I cheat, I don't care. Let's see the whole thing
[1931.32s -> 1949.32s]  All right, no more talking because I can't play video games talk at the same time. That was weird
[1963.68s -> 1966.88s]  Those of you that don't know what i'm talking about while you're playing the next game that you play
[1966.96s -> 1970.48s]  That's really like kind of a hard game. We have to pay attention. Just start talking out loud
[1971.10s -> 1974.27s]  You're gonna get killed you'll get hit like by everything that the monster does
[1974.51s -> 2013.48s]  I forget what's after this guy. Oh, that was a cool move
[2020.11s -> 2028.54s]  I can only hit him once here. Come on. What is this? There we go. The next boss is so hard. I forget who it is
[2029.18s -> 2031.10s]  Why do I not remember?
[2031.10s -> 2035.15s]  Well, let's see
[2035.15s -> 2057.68s]  I'm, not even on here
[2057.68s -> 2059.85s]  I'm, not on here. I must not have done it
[2061.10s -> 2063.77s]  Okay
[2063.77s -> 2065.77s]  Please take it easy on a poor old man
[2074.06s -> 2077.07s]  What the fuck was that? Okay
[2082.46s -> 2084.96s]  Uh, oh my goodness
[2086.17s -> 2088.17s]  You have to hit him on opposites
[2089.37s -> 2092.17s]  Wow, goodbye. That was that was ugly
[2099.31s -> 2103.53s]  So you have to alternate I think maybe I can stand still for that
[2105.71s -> 2115.88s]  Jeez duck, maybe I can only do it twice. What about hold on? Let me get that down. What is this? Is it up?
[2116.60s -> 2117.88s]  One, two, three
[2117.88s -> 2119.88s]  Sideways. Okay. That's one two, three sideways
[2121.85s -> 2123.61s]  goodness, jesus
[2123.61s -> 2142.59s]  Only two. Oh that kick hurts a lot
[2147.32s -> 2151.00s]  Can you imagine having to beat go through the entire game and not lose?
[2151.48s -> 2160.49s]  And then get to this guy and win or you have to do the whole thing all over again god
[2160.73s -> 2165.12s]  Which way does he go? I guess
[2165.12s -> 2174.70s]  The movements are really erratic too plus him having a cane
[2174.78s -> 2180.27s]  It's kind of like it's hard to tell when he's gonna swing or punch, but let's see what we can do
[2185.23s -> 2208.27s]  Ooh, I had power there. No, I want to get that. You know, I don't
[2208.83s -> 2215.16s]  I don't think i've ever seen the end of this game. Who's at the end? I'm, really curious now actually
[2238.72s -> 2257.63s]  Okay, well this is the first time i've downed him that's good at least i'm gonna I can get downed once
[2260.60s -> 2266.06s]  I should do for the health anyways
[2266.06s -> 2273.31s]  All right, this guy's gonna have to play so much zelda
[2279.79s -> 2289.55s]  God damn it, man. I don't even know how you would memorize this even playing here normally. Jesus. That's a good opportunity. I'm gonna take it
[2290.67s -> 2314.32s]  That's a good opportunity to hit. No, no, no. No, that does not count. That doesn't count either
[2314.48s -> 2355.08s]  Doesn't count either that was greedy. That was stupid. So it's up up down down
[2355.48s -> 2359.44s]  Let me see the whole thing
[2359.44s -> 2362.80s]  Up up up up up up down down down down. Okay
[2363.20s -> 2384.09s]  Ouch that didn't count now. I know why i've never seen what's after this guy because I definitely got here even while cheating
[2384.17s -> 2403.34s]  I probably was like nah, fuck this. I'd rather go eat like a sandwich or something. Okay, I can end it right here
[2404.94s -> 2412.89s]  Let's go. I've never seen this before. Yeah, I physically don't even know what the next fighter is
[2413.29s -> 2422.44s]  If you had irl safe dates, what would you try to master a professional sport?
[2423.93s -> 2434.03s]  Um, definitely something that with repetition not something with pure physical strength. Hmm
[2438.41s -> 2440.17s]  What physical sport?
[2440.17s -> 2444.25s]  What could I I don't know?
[2444.25s -> 2445.85s]  rick bruiser
[2445.85s -> 2457.15s]  My brother may be champ, but only because I let him win really I am the best I have seen this before
[2457.47s -> 2464.34s]  How come I don't remember? Okay, let's i'm gonna concentrate
[2467.07s -> 2484.40s]  That's weird. I don't like it. Okay, I guess I have to hit him in the stomach there. That was a counter-attack
[2486.73s -> 2498.83s]  Whoa, no, it's an elbow. Wait, let's go all the way back shit. God damn it
[2501.28s -> 2511.64s]  Doing all right starting out
[2529.24s -> 2544.38s]  Oh the counter-attack he does it every time oh, come on, dude, stop
[2547.23s -> 2554.28s]  It's up down. Hold on. No, no, no. No, it's your brain just wants to dodge so bad
[2554.44s -> 2563.08s]  It's don't move and then up and then left. Okay, don't move up left and then no punch
[2563.32s -> 2576.11s]  It's the same. No, it's up up down up up. Why'd you dodge up up down? Okay up
[2576.75s -> 2579.20s]  left
[2579.20s -> 2582.27s]  Fuck I forgot he does it again
[2582.51s -> 2593.52s]  This guy's ridiculous
[2598.33s -> 2605.50s]  Sit down at the first down of the second
[2620.86s -> 2626.30s]  Imagine save scumming this much. Okay, so that one's down up down
[2628.78s -> 2639.69s]  What? Oh, no, it's down up left. I wonder how many kids cried playing this like you have to have cried
[2641.56s -> 2677.07s]  You have to have cried right? Like I probably cried. Yeah, I had to have cried shit. Oh, that's a wanted kill. Oh
[2677.63s -> 2679.07s]  I forgot again
[2679.07s -> 2683.53s]  I'm, just trying not to get so bad shit
[2687.08s -> 2715.58s]  Okay, that's two up down left. No, it's down up down up left. Oh my goodness gracious
[2720.46s -> 2734.57s]  Even when you know it too. I tried to dodge it. It's like a half second window. I tried to dodge it again
[2736.16s -> 2746.57s]  No, no, no, no go back. I made it worse somehow. How did I just make it worse?
[2746.89s -> 2769.02s]  Oh, you can hit you on the way down too. Oh, it's like fighting margit for the first time, you know
[2769.02s -> 2776.08s]  It's like here comes this right you're dead. Only thing is I can't do this at margit
[2786.11s -> 2789.47s]  All right, we need to go way back. So before this went off completely collapsed
[2790.84s -> 2807.20s]  There we go, can I block it? Let me see if I can block it up. No, I can't here we go
[2810.09s -> 2821.76s]  Tried to dodge it too. All right, let's see what happens. I've never seen this before. This isn't a challenge anymore
[2821.76s -> 2823.64s]  Well, no, I mean this is
[2823.64s -> 2838.62s]  This is content i've never seen before. So what's after this?
[2840.49s -> 2842.86s]  Oh, no
[2842.86s -> 2846.70s]  It's just hard mode. Uh
[2855.90s -> 2858.86s]  Even with superpowers. I still think I don't think I can beat him
[2859.10s -> 2864.84s]  Can you imagine that imagine having save states a magical power and you still can't beat this guy?
[2869.42s -> 2871.18s]  so quick
[2871.18s -> 2874.12s]  No way. Oh my god
[2874.60s -> 2880.51s]  Okay
[2880.51s -> 2881.79s]  You have to alternate
[2881.79s -> 2904.56s]  He just broke my hand running his safe states actually are really tricky because you're just not ready to fight
[2904.80s -> 2915.64s]  It's you there's no rhythm with a safe state. Okay, so he breaks your hand if you punch him in the stomach, so don't do that
[2920.09s -> 2922.09s]  holy shit, that was
[2922.31s -> 2937.15s]  Immediate whatever it was. It's oh do it. Oh, whoa. He does two. Okay the double follow-up
[2940.20s -> 2942.20s]  Then is it duck I wonder I don't know
[2958.12s -> 2959.56s]  Please
[2959.56s -> 2975.29s]  Oh, how can I not? How did I not hit him? There's so much mix up here. Oh my god. He dodged it
[2984.12s -> 2987.00s]  Left up. Yep
[2987.40s -> 3008.14s]  Left down up. No, it's down up down up down up left down up right down down
[3010.41s -> 3014.14s]  Down, okay down up left
[3014.78s -> 3019.10s]  Down up down right left. Holy shit, dude. No, no kids beat this
[3025.45s -> 3029.21s]  Up up. No, it's different. He changes it every time
[3031.00s -> 3036.59s]  I'm done. That was fun. That was fun at one. I'm uh
[3038.96s -> 3046.94s]  I mean at this point i'm just literally gonna be saving state after every punch and that's not even gonna help
[3056.44s -> 3063.76s]  Yeah, it changes every time it looks like you can't hit him in the middle of this
[3064.68s -> 3070.93s]  Fuck can't even win with cheating. That's how you know. This is unbelievable
[3075.14s -> 3084.11s]  He just swings so often that you if you're not in the rhythm it's impossible down up left up down left
[3085.47s -> 3088.51s]  No, i'm done. I'm gonna play gold die for fucking an hour
[3098.18s -> 3100.58s]  Okay down up left
[3101.86s -> 3108.98s]  Does it change I feel like I can't even process that he's doing anything down up left up down
[3117.15s -> 3122.08s]  He keeps going. Holy shit
[3127.86s -> 3131.89s]  All right, you watch a youtube video if you want to see the rest
[3132.21s -> 3137.74s]  I'm, not doing this anymore. That was cool. I've it's cool to see this other guy for the first time ever
[3140.11s -> 3149.63s]  Um, this is fun. Let's play gold night. I I mean you you want to do the guy that's that's designed
[3150.29s -> 3154.61s]  For you to take like 75 in quarters from you with the arcade. I don't believe so
[3156.91s -> 3161.55s]  Imagine okay think of it might be putting quarters in I just put in a quarter right now
[3167.36s -> 3170.08s]  By the way, I don't think there even was quarters. This is the super nintendo version
[3174.83s -> 3182.69s]  The arcade version was back in the regular nintendo era. Yeah, let's play gold night. That was fun
[3185.42s -> 3187.42s]  Fuck this guy. I'm not doing that
[3187.50s -> 3201.30s]  I want to play one level in gold night that I remember the arcade version was a different game
[3201.30s -> 3206.82s]  Yeah, but it came out around the same. Um era as the nes one, right? Is that what I remember?
[3208.27s -> 3209.86s]  I want to play
[3209.86s -> 3215.63s]  Gold and I I want to get to level two. I'm not going to play this for very long. I just want to do it
[3225.74s -> 3229.26s]  Oh, okay. Here we go
[3229.26s -> 3232.43s]  Like mission damn. All right, i'm gonna do secret agent
[3232.99s -> 3250.14s]  Neutralize all alarms and bungee jump off the platform. You guys remember this game. I remember this game
[3251.02s -> 3252.22s]  Cool
[3252.22s -> 3257.26s]  Anything else? Nah, that's it. I just remember it. Do you yeah. Oh, all right good
[3260.26s -> 3262.26s]  so gold and I
[3262.50s -> 3264.50s]  Those this game auto aims
[3265.60s -> 3268.94s]  I don't know
[3268.94s -> 3270.94s]  Whoa, wait a sec
[3271.70s -> 3273.70s]  Okay, so it's left and right
[3274.86s -> 3287.63s]  Left and right the right. Okay, that's inverted. We are not doing that. We're not doing that. Can this be changed?
[3291.26s -> 3299.06s]  Okay, there we go upright is fine auto aim is on aim control i'm gonna say hold is fine
[3299.14s -> 3313.62s]  Okay, already people attacking me. How do you shoot? This guy sucks at shooting
[3319.10s -> 3321.55s]  All right
[3321.55s -> 3323.55s]  I love the the death sounds
[3323.95s -> 3325.95s]  that like
[3332.46s -> 3344.21s]  All right, it's left trigger to shoot I think it's how do you change weapons there we go, okay
[3349.82s -> 3351.42s]  All right, we're doing fine
[3351.42s -> 3365.79s]  The pencil no, that's the duracell battery. That's the double packet of double-a batteries. Okay. Was there anything up here?
[3366.27s -> 3368.51s]  Isn't there body armor or something here? Oh, yep. Give me that
[3369.07s -> 3370.74s]  sniper rifle
[3370.74s -> 3378.77s]  All right, get out of here
[3378.77s -> 3381.81s]  Yep, there's a wall in front of me. Where is the glass?
[3382.61s -> 3383.57s]  What?
[3383.57s -> 3388.59s]  Is there there's no jump right?
[3388.59s -> 3401.70s]  Through this game. I forgot how weirdly this game was controlled
[3402.77s -> 3406.88s]  All right, here we go. So left right bumper
[3407.84s -> 3413.68s]  And then left stick and then left trigger it's like the opposite of what a game controls like nowadays
[3414.32s -> 3425.30s]  All right, get him
[3425.30s -> 3427.86s]  Grandma put on the vr helmet for the first time ever
[3428.42s -> 3453.20s]  Okay, uh, give me the other gun. Yeah. No, no this thing
[3463.82s -> 3469.30s]  Nothing up there. That was a really fast knife. Yeah, it was kind of semi-automatic
[3474.18s -> 3476.90s]  I'm dizzy
[3476.90s -> 3483.62s]  Yeah, me too, but we'll be all right
[3491.54s -> 3502.24s]  Uh, I have to press this button. You have to do a bunch of control changes in the menu to make it feel more modern
[3505.15s -> 3508.59s]  Uh, i'll I don't mind I get used to it. It's gonna take a minute or two
[3523.82s -> 3550.70s]  Thanks roll. Can't you change this game to be widescreen? Oh great. Why are they not aiming at me?
[3551.18s -> 3580.99s]  Okay, we're good. Oh, what's this open that up? Can I I just want to do the facility?
[3580.99s -> 3602.77s]  That's the only one I want to play open the facility is the best level in the whole game, especially on multiplayer
[3603.09s -> 3622.13s]  This is so epic. Hey, i'll be honest with you though
[3623.49s -> 3630.19s]  Um, i'll show my age here a little bit here. This was the coolest thing to ever come out in like 30 years. This was
[3631.07s -> 3636.11s]  My fortnight guys. This is the shit that I played when I was like 12 13 14
[3651.07s -> 3655.47s]  I am holding i'm moving the right stick which is that's just burned in your brain permanently
[3656.19s -> 3663.73s]  What I'm with it was something else. Oh, yeah
[3667.41s -> 3669.97s]  Imagine sitting around i'm gonna paint it. Let me paint a picture for you
[3670.94s -> 3672.94s]  imagine sitting around a
[3673.82s -> 3675.34s]  square
[3675.34s -> 3676.76s]  like
[3676.76s -> 3678.76s]  19-inch square television
[3679.95s -> 3681.95s]  Four people huddled around it
[3682.82s -> 3685.54s]  four split screen player co-op
[3686.83s -> 3688.83s]  You had the amount of viewing angle
[3689.63s -> 3691.63s]  That is on an iphone right now
[3697.58s -> 3716.72s]  And we loved every second of it. It's already in here
[3719.17s -> 3721.17s]  You're gonna play lies of p. Um
[3723.24s -> 3726.28s]  Probably not at least not immediately
[3727.95s -> 3733.26s]  whoa
[3733.26s -> 3739.81s]  It was from all the way down. Okay. I'm just gonna leave that guy
[3752.32s -> 3759.42s]  Now enough of the explosion. I might not even get through this level
[3760.06s -> 3765.09s]  i'm in trouble
[3765.09s -> 3771.62s]  Isn't this this is the end up coming up right here, right?
[3774.35s -> 3776.91s]  There are no saves, uh rewinds in um in this game
[3781.84s -> 3783.36s]  Although I could do this
[3783.36s -> 3790.99s]  Wait, how do I get to it?
[3790.99s -> 3815.92s]  We're cheating. Just want to do the first part of the facility. That's it. I didn't win. Um
[3816.80s -> 3819.17s]  What is the there's like a side?
[3819.49s -> 3827.41s]  Where do I go? I remember it's like a boat
[3828.88s -> 3843.84s]  Oh, yeah, you go this way. Honestly vr controls would be easier
[3844.32s -> 3857.84s]  Wait, where is it mission status incomplete? No. Oh, is it because I did the secret agent mode?
[3858.32s -> 3889.06s]  Do I have to complete everything other side down here? Just jump off the first tower. Why don't you jump off the dam?
[3890.45s -> 3893.73s]  Oh my goodness
[3893.73s -> 3894.61s]  Yeah
[3894.61s -> 3900.78s]  Holding left holding right stick left and not moving left is like I may as well be playing backwards
[3901.02s -> 3919.22s]  This is from all the very first tower. You actually don't have to come all the way down here
[3919.38s -> 3934.53s]  It's been a very long time. What's that on the other side?
[3935.65s -> 3939.34s]  Wait fake fan
[3939.34s -> 3943.98s]  Yeah, let me go. Let me go wake up. Jeremy from when he was 17 and be like, hey, dude
[3944.14s -> 3946.77s]  Why the fuck don't you remember this?
[3946.77s -> 3952.45s]  Hey, you were 14 25 years ago. Why don't you remember where the bungee jump is stupid?
[3955.50s -> 3957.50s]  I'll go tell him i'm gonna go tell him
[3959.09s -> 3974.27s]  Yeah, i'm gonna tell him right now. Okay. This is the level I actually wanted to play
[3976.26s -> 3977.86s]  Oh god, damn it
[3977.86s -> 3984.69s]  Do I actually have to do it again?
[3984.69s -> 3990.05s]  Because you have to destroy if you can't just beat it. That's why you only that's why you don't do secret agent first
[3991.02s -> 4006.14s]  Nobody told him check this out. He didn't pull the shoot
[4028.90s -> 4032.70s]  I just want to do the thing in the facility. It's my favorite level
[4033.34s -> 4077.68s]  All right, come down. Oh, don't press that. That's the alarm. Give me that thing. I know this thing is good
[4077.76s -> 4082.26s]  I remember using it. No, there it is. I love this weapon. It's like the best weapon
[4082.82s -> 4091.70s]  When you get two of these it's so fun
[4091.70s -> 4114.85s]  All right. There we go
[4114.85s -> 4146.06s]  Hey, there it is. All right best level in the game. Let's go so you can really mess this up a million different ways
[4146.83s -> 4155.46s]  Um, we'll see how well I do this, but I remember this in particular doing multiplayer
[4156.16s -> 4163.78s]  Uh when you got to be up here hiding in the bathroom was always the most fun thing ever because in multiplayer
[4165.14s -> 4168.34s]  Yeah, you could screen cheat but come on in. Yeah, come and get me
[4169.36s -> 4176.13s]  I know you're gonna open that door and then you and then all of a sudden you see a proximity mine gets thrown up at you
[4178.37s -> 4189.02s]  Yeah, come on get the guy that's over here i'm hiding up here with the golden gun and you were just unbeatable
[4189.42s -> 4194.03s]  The golden gun killed anybody. Okay. Here we go
[4194.35s -> 4203.10s]  Let's have some fun
[4203.10s -> 4209.01s]  He's so shit-faced. It's so hard to control this. How do I detonate them?
[4210.88s -> 4212.74s]  Not like that
[4212.74s -> 4223.42s]  How do you detonate? I don't know. Isn't it? It's like a different item, isn't it? Yeah, it's this one
[4229.47s -> 4243.47s]  Isn't there something in one of these I feel like there's something in right here
[4243.87s -> 4254.74s]  Okay, the whole goal with this is you're supposed to get down here
[4255.06s -> 4260.00s]  You have to press a bunch of buttons and shit and then you have to get through and find one of the scientists
[4260.16s -> 4302.50s]  I don't know. Let's just go. Can we open this? All right, we have to do this quick body armor looks good
[4302.82s -> 4315.31s]  We made it through here
[4315.31s -> 4323.09s]  Why does it explode for 10 seconds? Yeah, the after explosion is huge. All right now this part's important. I remember this
[4324.29s -> 4332.78s]  You I need I think I need your key card. Oh shit. I'm sorry. How do I um, I need the key card
[4333.50s -> 4342.14s]  Doesn't he have a key card?
[4342.14s -> 4352.18s]  Oh the other doctor
[4352.26s -> 4405.98s]  That one right there. Huh? Don't you where do you get a key card? You don't need the key card on this difficulty
[4406.06s -> 4429.79s]  Oh, okay. I'm gonna do this because I feel like it's very necessary. Okay. Now, what do I can I get the key card?
[4439.46s -> 4483.84s]  Yeah, there's a named character that's in this level somewhere. Where are you guys going? Holy shit. That's a lot of people. Oh
[4485.20s -> 4506.42s]  Turn on paintball mode. There's a ton of random cheats you can do
[4506.74s -> 4519.20s]  I think you have to beat the game on certain difficulties to unlock them though, right? All right
[4519.20s -> 4536.69s]  I'm gonna save it here boy
[4536.69s -> 4538.69s]  Um, oh no
[4541.57s -> 4547.06s]  Keep this out. All right. So there is
[4547.92s -> 4556.02s]  There's a lot of people here. Ah, where are you? I think one of these guys has something that I need
[4556.34s -> 4561.25s]  Do you guys have something everybody have a key card?
[4575.41s -> 4596.77s]  Uh, all right. Well, at least I saved it. No, no, no, no, no
[4597.01s -> 4622.56s]  All right, i'm gonna stay right here just for a second. Not you. There we are. Hey, what's up time to leave?
