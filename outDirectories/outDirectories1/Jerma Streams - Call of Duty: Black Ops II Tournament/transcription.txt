[4.09s -> 11.98s]  How are we doing? Good afternoon. How are we doing? Good, good, good, good, good.
[11.98s -> 23.54s]  You are currently joining me and us for a Black Ops 2 tournament. It's being hosted by Myth.
[26.41s -> 33.37s]  I'm very, very scared. I don't... I played Call of Duty a little bit. I was a kind of a Call of Duty
[34.17s -> 39.50s]  player for... I want to say just to desperately make YouTube videos.
[40.14s -> 47.26s]  It's like, oh, I know. I'll just play like Black Ops 2 or something. And I made some terrible
[47.26s -> 55.32s]  fucking videos. I played for about an hour. This is the perspective that you want to watch if you
[55.32s -> 63.03s]  want to make fun of the streamer. If you want to ask like, oh dude, what the fuck is this guy doing
[63.03s -> 69.11s]  here? You know what I mean? I'll be the pin cushion today, right? If you want to come talk
[69.11s -> 78.78s]  shit to somebody today, just stay here. If I go 0 and 30, I'll get at least like a dozen kills,
[78.78s -> 87.43s]  okay? I can promise you that. I will accept... I will be the vacuum for all the negativity today.
[89.34s -> 94.94s]  It's going to be really fun. I'm actually excited. But I actually might surprise you. We'll see.
[97.66s -> 109.53s]  I might surprise you today. We'll find out. Currently just running around in the... We're
[109.53s -> 121.56s]  doing a free for all. Get the ear wig ready. Dude, I don't even know what guns to use.
[121.56s -> 127.83s]  In chat like 20 minutes ago, I was like, what's a good weapon to use? I don't know.
[128.55s -> 134.71s]  I genuinely have no fucking idea. I just have a rapid fire extended mags sub machine gun.
[134.71s -> 139.51s]  That's it. I'm just going to hold the button down. I'm going to play Pyro.
[140.07s -> 148.26s]  Can you guys hear the game? Let me see how we're doing here.
[152.50s -> 155.38s]  They just stuck with it. They would have gotten the big one and all even out.
[157.30s -> 169.42s]  We're still kind of preparing. Don't worry. I will show. I just got a kill. I actually just
[169.42s -> 184.47s]  got a kill. You just didn't see it. Should I even use grenades? All right. I'm good to go.
[184.47s -> 191.91s]  What's up, everybody? I'm just hoping to get one kill this whole entire event.
[192.81s -> 194.01s]  They're just updating it real quick.
[196.01s -> 202.57s]  Just want to make sure I was not behind. That was not me.
[207.91s -> 215.86s]  You just hear like... Are we playing zombies? No, actually, I don't know the format.
[216.50s -> 226.60s]  I think we met team. Team deathmatch. Domination, probably. Yeah, we're still preparing.
[235.10s -> 240.09s]  You have to play zombies. Wait, wait, wait. Do we have some advice here?
[240.73s -> 246.98s]  From experience, cigarette smokers perform 20%... I'm not going to read the rest of that.
[246.98s -> 252.38s]  Thank you for the comment, though. The game's too violent. I don't know if I can watch.
[256.73s -> 259.69s]  I think we're going to get started. I have... I don't know what to say.
[262.73s -> 268.95s]  This is going to be fucked up. Did they ban rivers of blood? Oh, yeah, it's banned.
[269.51s -> 278.57s]  We're missing a teammate? I'm pretty sure a couple people had to drop just because of the
[278.57s -> 288.38s]  change to this week. So we have a couple of new teammates, I think, from my understanding.
[288.38s -> 290.54s]  But we'll get started shortly. Somebody just dove out of the window.
[291.18s -> 296.23s]  I would be showing this, but I think we're going to restart the server, so... Oh, yeah.
[298.26s -> 306.36s]  All right, you know what? Do a prediction. How about this? Will I place at one point in the top
[306.36s -> 316.74s]  two of... No, top three of my team. Will I place in the top three point-wise on the team at any
[316.74s -> 331.64s]  point during the entire night? No, sorry, King. Who is he talking to? You! I'm talking to you!
[332.44s -> 354.87s]  So should we go to our team channels now? I think... Who's on team two?
[358.63s -> 366.50s]  I don't know. If you're on team two, let's hop down to team two.
[366.50s -> 369.56s]  Which is team two. Yes, chef.
[371.29s -> 380.01s]  Yes, chef. Event info.
[381.50s -> 388.06s]  All right, I'm in the team two lobby. All right, here. Let's start streaming, huh? What do you say?
[392.02s -> 401.88s]  Okay. Jerma. Hey! This is our first time playing together, I think. I know. Well,
[401.88s -> 407.48s]  wait. No, we did the battleship tournament. Oh, yeah. I totally forgot about that.
[409.64s -> 413.32s]  You absolutely destroyed me in one of our games. It was actually pretty close.
[413.32s -> 417.46s]  Pretty close, actually. How much of a Call of Duty guy are you?
[417.46s -> 425.54s]  I played when I was 13. Yeah. And that's about it. I'm kind of sad I couldn't get my
[425.54s -> 430.84s]  controller to work with plutonium, but... Oh, you were going controller.
[430.84s -> 436.28s]  Well, okay, this is kind of a weird thing to say, but if you use controller in this game,
[436.28s -> 437.88s]  you get aim assist. You do?
[438.78s -> 447.37s]  Yes. So like, your crosshair will just lock on to them. If you're like slightly off, it just locks on.
[447.37s -> 450.09s]  That seems amazing. I should plug it in. Does it work?
[450.09s -> 454.41s]  Yeah. If you can get it to work, it's definitely a lot better.
[454.41s -> 460.82s]  I first was standing still and I couldn't even kill him. I'm so bad at this game.
[460.82s -> 470.01s]  I can get it to like do everything, but walk around. What? Xbox controller?
[470.01s -> 472.33s]  I love the Switch controller. It's kind of weird, but...
[472.33s -> 478.52s]  Wait, you say Switch controller? Yeah. Yeah. I like the Switch Pro controller.
[478.52s -> 482.92s]  Oh, okay. I don't know why I was thinking about the... I thought you had Joy-Cons in your hand.
[482.92s -> 486.36s]  I don't know why for some reason. Oh, not that. I mean, the Switch Pro controller.
[487.38s -> 491.46s]  It's pretty much an Xbox controller, but slightly smaller.
[493.75s -> 496.55s]  Yeah. That's like the best controller that you mentioned it.
[496.55s -> 498.04s]  Yeah. I think I have one somewhere.
[498.68s -> 503.56s]  Yeah. It depends on hand size, but for me, it's like, I like the Xbox controller,
[503.56s -> 509.18s]  but that one fits my hand a little bit. So it's kind of...
[509.18s -> 516.52s]  Yeah. PlayStation 5 and 4? My thumbs bump into each other all the time.
[516.52s -> 519.96s]  Oh, God. Yeah. That's me with the PlayStation. Yeah.
[519.96s -> 522.04s]  Yeah. Not my favorite.
[523.75s -> 528.52s]  Not bad, but... Oh, you just got me. You got me right in the head.
[528.52s -> 529.88s]  It was in the head? Yeah. Amazing.
[530.44s -> 531.64s]  Okay. So, wait, have you played Call of Duty before?
[531.64s -> 537.19s]  That was pretty good. That was pretty good. Yeah. Just a little bit.
[537.19s -> 545.06s]  There's a cheese build in Call of Duty that used to be all the rage for highlight reels
[545.06s -> 551.34s]  called quickscoping, where you just get a sniper and you run around and try and snipe them really,
[551.34s -> 555.54s]  really fast. So you're a quickscoper?
[555.54s -> 558.50s]  Well, I like doing it, but I'm not good at it.
[560.78s -> 561.82s]  Dude, I had a... That's what you would see
[561.82s -> 566.78s]  in all the highlight reels, though. I had a video series on Machinima Respawn,
[566.78s -> 571.94s]  like 10 years ago, where I played Call of Duty. And it was...
[571.94s -> 574.90s]  You liked it. I mean, I was playing a character.
[574.90s -> 579.72s]  It was not really me playing. It was, but it wasn't.
[579.72s -> 581.24s]  Oh, right. This gun is disgusting.
[581.24s -> 586.71s]  What is this thing? Should I use this? Oh, that's an LMG.
[587.16s -> 591.40s]  Okay. I'm going to be honest. The guns I recommend is the Fall.
[591.40s -> 594.94s]  I think it's an assault rifle. That one's pretty good.
[594.94s -> 610.81s]  Yeah. Let me see. I got the PDW57, Scorpion, Type 25, LSAT, and the SVUAS. Are those okay?
[614.36s -> 620.47s]  Yeah. But I'm telling you, the Fall is insane. You're on my team, right?
[620.47s -> 621.94s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[621.94s -> 630.86s]  The Fall OST or something. Fall OSW. It's an assault rifle. It's a single fire.
[630.86s -> 635.67s]  It's pretty much the best gun in the game. Oh, it's single fire.
[635.67s -> 641.59s]  Is this the game that had the akimbo... What was it? The akimbo scorpions or something?
[641.59s -> 646.55s]  Oh, I don't know if this specific one has it, but one of the Call of Duties has that, yeah.
[646.55s -> 650.18s]  I remember people were like, one of that bands. People freaked out over that.
[650.18s -> 653.94s]  Yeah. So the Fall is actually also banned. Oh, it's banned?
[655.10s -> 659.58s]  In the old tournaments of this game, it was banned because it's pretty much objectively
[659.58s -> 667.02s]  the best gun. It wasn't the least amount. When I go back, I might put it on. I might
[667.02s -> 670.14s]  leave and put it on. I would definitely put it on,
[670.14s -> 675.30s]  but I mean, it depends. If you're like a sprayer, it's not good for spraying.
[675.30s -> 679.62s]  Yeah. I'm kind of a hold the button down and hope that somebody dies.
[679.62s -> 688.38s]  Yeah. Yeah. So if you're a sprayer, maybe I'd go for like the AN-94 solid. I mean, honestly,
[688.54s -> 691.83s]  none you're using is pretty decent too. It's just reducing.
[691.83s -> 696.79s]  Yeah. So somebody in chat just copy and pasted this build and I just put it in here. I was like,
[696.79s -> 706.55s]  yeah, sure. I'll try it for a little bit. It was just a copy and paste.
[706.55s -> 710.71s]  I mean, I think the thing about Call of Duty is you can't really go too wrong because every
[710.71s -> 717.50s]  gun kills in like two seconds. Not even two seconds, honestly. So it's like just how it goes.
[717.50s -> 721.98s]  Kind of. Did the game start yet? Wait, we don't play. Oh, okay. I was like, wait,
[721.98s -> 726.14s]  we're playing. We only have you and me here. Yeah, we're killing each other. So
[726.14s -> 737.02s]  surely we're not playing yet, right? Hello. Hey. Yo. Oh, hey. We got half the team here.
[737.02s -> 742.23s]  Are you guys ready to win? Oh, okay. So we have half the team. Okay. Cool. So now I'm not in like
[742.23s -> 750.71s]  a huge rush to make class real quick. Yeah. I've got about maybe 12 total hours in Call of Duty.
[750.71s -> 759.85s]  I'm going to need a hard carry. Oh, no. That's more than me, honestly. So you know what? I think
[759.85s -> 764.78s]  I might surprise a lot of people, though, once I get in the game mode. You know, if it means
[764.78s -> 770.74s]  anything, I've never seen you be bad at a game before. I'm okay. I can be okay sometimes.
[771.96s -> 776.92s]  Is everything good on your end? Very humble. We got to play multi versus. Okay. Yes. I got everything
[776.92s -> 783.16s]  figured out. That's just mad at the resolution. Oh, okay. Is the resolution wonky? Yeah. You just
[783.16s -> 789.45s]  fix it in settings though. Oh, sick. Shit. Okay. Are we doing a server or custom class?
[790.09s -> 798.74s]  Uh, server. So if your classes have to be made under the ranked setting and then make your classes
[798.74s -> 823.24s]  there and then we'll go to server browser and then. Okay. Okay. Oh, I got a medal. Ooh. Wait,
[823.24s -> 830.23s]  Mithy, you're on our team? Yeah, I'm on your guys' team. Ooh. Let's go. Okay. So I'm kind of the
[830.23s -> 835.06s]  equivalent to John. And so I think it actually, the balance is actually pretty good still. Okay.
[835.06s -> 849.77s]  Cool. Cool. Cool. Ooh. I'm glad you're on my team. I just killed like four people with a knife.
[850.49s -> 859.78s]  Well, I'll make it five. Oh, I forgot the shotgun thing. Okay. The knife is an instant kill no
[859.78s -> 864.82s]  matter what, right? The Moss Borg. Yeah. The knife is an instant kill. It's kind of OP.
[864.82s -> 894.62s]  I just flashed myself. Wait, you're like doing drop shots and stuff. Jesus. Sure. You haven't
[894.62s -> 898.22s]  played this before. That's the first time I've clicked that button. I think the whole time we've
[898.22s -> 904.10s]  been here. Oh, okay. That's it's like a thing people would sometimes do. They randomly just
[904.10s -> 911.37s]  lay on the floor to try and dodge bullets and stuff. You're killing people that are AFK. No,
[911.37s -> 916.65s]  I'm not. Everyone's warming up. Yeah. Yeah. We're mostly just trying to get used to our key binds
[916.65s -> 928.66s]  and sensitivity. I mean, it's not like it started. It seems I am not the only spy. You know what you
[928.66s -> 934.18s]  could do? Make one of those ballistic knife, like running builds or whatever. Oh, you like
[934.18s -> 944.49s]  you shoot it out, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm good. I keep hitting R with the LMG and that's not good.
[944.49s -> 958.17s]  I got to keep. I had to do that more often. That works it in control. When you start shooting
[958.17s -> 966.58s]  people like in what case and what scenario just anytime I'm firing at anybody, I just hit control
[966.58s -> 977.08s]  when I go down. Is that smarter or stupid? Bro, I haven't played this since 2012.
[980.33s -> 984.81s]  It's so funny. Half our team is just like, oh yeah, I played Call of Duty on the toilet one time.
[984.81s -> 995.83s]  It's like 2012 this game was released and I don't even think I played it on PC on top of that.
[995.83s -> 1003.14s]  Yeah. Like all like console or something. Hey, it's all right. We have a couple people laying
[1003.14s -> 1010.12s]  on hard carriers. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I'm really hoping I can lay. I haven't even gotten
[1010.12s -> 1018.79s]  warmed up yet. I'm still making my classes. Is scorpion any good? Should I try scorpion?
[1018.79s -> 1025.35s]  Oh, scorpion is pretty good. Yeah. It has a really good time to shoot super fast.
[1027.13s -> 1034.06s]  I think it's good. I could be. I haven't played this in quite some time. I'm never taking this off.
[1035.06s -> 1041.67s]  Bro, there's no way you just. You run out of ammo so fast. What happens if you run out of ammo?
[1042.81s -> 1048.78s]  Well, you should. Is that it? I think if you have scavenger on, you should be fine.
[1049.74s -> 1056.86s]  So the strat is to get someone else. Are we doing S and D? Yeah, what's the game? What do we do for
[1056.86s -> 1061.90s]  game mode? I'm guessing it's fivey five. So I'm guessing it's an S and D. Yeah. Right. Oh, no.
[1062.46s -> 1068.46s]  So just go to the tournament browser or the browser and then it's the server on there.
[1068.46s -> 1074.31s]  I think I'm going to use this. Sorry. Was that not the question that I come in?
[1078.58s -> 1086.49s]  All right. I was saying like the the this is times two. Oh, the game. Oh, so it's going to be
[1086.49s -> 1095.27s]  a hard point. Dom and S and D. Oh, OK. We almost ready, Kelly. Yeah, I'm almost done making my
[1095.27s -> 1115.38s]  classes. Sorry. OK. Well, that's really bad. Hello. Just hear me. Yeah. Yes. That doesn't
[1115.38s -> 1120.82s]  fucking my audio. My mic is like bugging. Should be fine, though. You sound pretty clean. You're
[1120.82s -> 1126.50s]  here. All right. Cool. I can hear you. All right. Let me make one more class just in case. And
[1126.50s -> 1178.90s]  then nobody spawn here. You don't spawn in line at line of sight. Oh, oh, all right.
[1182.12s -> 1191.59s]  I look like a fucking idiot. I I'm I'm baffled. I'm just walking into walls. I was testing
[1191.59s -> 1212.28s]  something. Look, what am I doing over here? I'm worse than a bot right now. I do like this gun,
[1212.28s -> 1222.41s]  though. I'm going to keep it. Yeah. This this thing, you just have to just let the game play
[1222.49s -> 1243.99s]  for you. Why are you using target finder? What's that? What do you mean? Do I have
[1243.99s -> 1252.81s]  target? What does that mean? I hope I didn't make a mistake or anything.
[1264.26s -> 1266.90s]  How has it been 10 years and some of these guns are still not fixed?
[1267.46s -> 1273.78s]  I mean, it's been 10 years and their game client has never been fixed.
[1275.96s -> 1322.38s]  I was like AFK making a sandwich. 360 no scope me. I got hit. My knife button is weird. I'm
[1322.38s -> 1334.57s]  going to change it. I'm just working on my sensitivity and then I'm ready.
[1334.89s -> 1369.83s]  OK, you guys get disconnected from the server. Use your radar last time. That didn't work
[1369.83s -> 1381.82s]  last time. Well, they don't work. Oh, my resolution. Oh, is it just mega fucked?
[1381.82s -> 1403.69s]  Oh, fuck. I'm sorry about that. So what is search and destroy?
[1403.69s -> 1410.94s]  I was I was played. It's kind of like Valorant. All right. For someone who would explain a game
[1410.94s -> 1417.00s]  mode to someone that's never played Valorant. So basically one team is defending a bomb site
[1417.00s -> 1423.58s]  and then another team is trying to attack it. OK, and the the team that's attacking has to plant
[1423.58s -> 1427.34s]  the bomb. And then if the bomb detonates, they win the round and the defending team has to defuse
[1427.34s -> 1432.94s]  the bomb. So it's like Counter-Strike. Oh, yeah. That honestly, that would have been such a better
[1432.94s -> 1440.26s]  example. And no response. Yes. Yeah, no response. So you die, you die. OK. Till the next round.
[1441.06s -> 1464.94s]  Counter-Strike is Valorant. I have not played Valorant. I played Counter-Strike maybe a little.
[1464.94s -> 1469.82s]  Why are you making fun of how I'm saying that Valorant? What's what's what's wrong with that?
[1469.82s -> 1476.18s]  Valorant. All right, Kaylee, is it ready to go? Please tell me everything. Did I get the kill?
[1476.18s -> 1482.33s]  That would have been funny on the screen. Is there any way that we can help?
[1484.04s -> 1487.80s]  Valorant. No, no, no, I got it. I'm figuring it out. I'm just kind of like
[1488.44s -> 1496.49s]  up like that. OK, OK. Well, we're just whenever everyone of you guys are ready,
[1496.49s -> 1499.85s]  let's go up to the team one and then we'll start up once everyone's on the server.
[1506.12s -> 1511.72s]  All right. So so are we playing on Newtown first? You know what you're doing.
[1513.22s -> 1517.38s]  Me? Who? Yeah, you know. Yeah, don't don't mean me. Yeah, you know what you're doing.
[1517.38s -> 1525.90s]  I mean, I played when I was like 13. So I mean, I've played once or twice. Like riding a bike.
[1525.90s -> 1530.86s]  Wait, Dean, you definitely know what you're doing, too, right? No, no, I missed like three
[1530.86s -> 1535.02s]  times. Are you using the DSR 50 or the ballista? It's one of the preset it.
[1535.98s -> 1542.95s]  You're using a preset. Yeah, it'll probably be. I wasn't trying to use a sniper like during this
[1543.83s -> 1548.55s]  situation. Yeah, I'm not confident to use anything that requires any amount of skill to aim.
[1550.02s -> 1558.54s]  Not now. Yeah, that's it's honestly respectable. I mean, I'll go in 20 and be the embarrassment.
[1558.54s -> 1562.60s]  Like there's no like prize money or anything, right? I mean, I think it's just fun.
[1563.48s -> 1568.84s]  OK, yeah, yeah, just making sure just it's bragging rights doesn't have to be for money.

[1629.30s -> 1639.70s]  Honestly, fuck shit. I mean, it's fine. Just I can count the pixels. I mean, if you want to
[1639.70s -> 1645.56s]  spend two minutes with us to see if we can sort it, that's fine. We're happy to do that.

[2471.02s -> 2471.82s]  It's okay, it's okay.
[2471.82s -> 2472.22s]  Excuse me.
[2472.22s -> 2472.78s]  We can get this still.
[2477.50s -> 2478.22s]  I'll take it.
[2478.22s -> 2479.98s]  Oh, fuck, I can't move.
[2479.98s -> 2482.17s]  No, it's a stun-nade.
[2483.29s -> 2484.57s]  I'm tired of getting stunned.
[2485.69s -> 2486.70s]  Next point up.
[2487.34s -> 2488.30s]  Shit, Jermall, let's go.
[2489.02s -> 2490.22s]  Jermall, that's me.
[2490.22s -> 2490.46s]  What?
[2490.46s -> 2491.42s]  That's you, that's you.
[2492.06s -> 2493.90s]  Oh, I thought that was a bad guy.
[2494.14s -> 2501.90s]  Oh, they're all over that car, man.
[2501.90s -> 2503.52s]  We'll even fuck out of it.
[2503.52s -> 2505.60s]  I got to, I was, I started so well.
[2505.60s -> 2506.08s]  Come on.
[2506.72s -> 2507.36s]  They got one.
[2507.36s -> 2511.07s]  They got two players playing across, one going into our spawn.
[2511.95s -> 2512.43s]  Watch out.
[2512.43s -> 2512.75s]  Oops.
[2513.23s -> 2514.03s]  All right, point.
[2514.03s -> 2519.02s]  Yeah, we're back on point.
[2519.02s -> 2520.38s]  Second floor, second floor.
[2520.38s -> 2529.84s]  Oh, don't go for two back because you're flipping spawns.
[2529.84s -> 2530.64s]  Yeah.
[2530.64s -> 2535.44s]  So if we contain mid control and just hold them out and spawn, we should be fine.
[2535.44s -> 2536.32s]  Come on, we should be fine.
[2539.10s -> 2539.98s]  Next point up soon.
[2540.62s -> 2543.44s]  I couldn't see there's no smoke.
[2545.29s -> 2546.17s]  New point, our point.
[2546.81s -> 2548.41s]  All right, we defend, defend, defend.
[2548.41s -> 2553.90s]  I'm holding this fucking door.
[2553.90s -> 2555.20s]  Ain't nobody getting through here.
[2556.19s -> 2559.71s]  Chad, how the fuck do I use my goddamn stun-nade, man?
[2561.31s -> 2562.19s]  Oh, I didn't see him.
[2562.19s -> 2566.75s]  Flank, flank, flank.
[2566.75s -> 2567.95s]  Oh, I was out in the open.
[2570.83s -> 2571.95s]  Oh, it's four.
[2571.95s -> 2572.99s]  God bless.
[2572.99s -> 2573.55s]  Where are they at?
[2575.24s -> 2576.52s]  On point and they're spawning.
[2577.48s -> 2577.96s]  Across.
[2583.29s -> 2583.85s]  Oh, one is.
[2584.65s -> 2586.38s]  Gotta get in there.
[2587.74s -> 2589.02s]  I'm going in, I'm on point, I'm on point.
[2590.06s -> 2591.26s]  Fuck, he was behind me.
[2591.26s -> 2591.90s]  Nice, nice.
[2591.90s -> 2592.54s]  Oh, god damn it.
[2595.18s -> 2596.06s]  Nade it, nade it, nade it.
[2596.06s -> 2596.56s]  Oh.
[2599.64s -> 2601.47s]  Nice try, nice try, nice try.
[2601.47s -> 2602.91s]  It's the first game on.
[2602.91s -> 2603.55s]  Oh, god.
[2604.11s -> 2605.87s]  I got my settings figured out.
[2605.87s -> 2607.63s]  So we got the next one.
[2607.63s -> 2608.19s]  Hell yeah.
[2608.19s -> 2609.07s]  The settings.
[2609.07s -> 2609.79s]  All right, we're good, we're good.
[2609.79s -> 2610.83s]  Team one to talk shit.
[2612.41s -> 2620.38s]  Not bad.
[2624.14s -> 2624.86s]  That was not bad.
[2624.86s -> 2627.50s]  Definitely, we could have done worse, that's for sure.
[2630.57s -> 2633.29s]  Definitely gotta do tasks, Matt.
[2633.29s -> 2635.15s]  Should I stick with this?
[2635.15s -> 2636.43s]  No, I don't know.
[2637.82s -> 2638.32s]  Yeah.
[2638.62s -> 2639.68s]  So wait, are we going again?
[2640.78s -> 2641.28s]  Yeah.
[2643.39s -> 2644.03s]  Nice job.
[2645.76s -> 2646.96s]  Good game, good game, everybody.
[2646.96s -> 2648.24s]  You don't fuck with that, you don't fuck with that.
[2650.86s -> 2651.74s]  I didn't even talk shit.
[2651.74s -> 2653.50s]  I just went up there and said, good game, everybody.
[2654.06s -> 2655.69s]  That was it.
[2655.69s -> 2656.49s]  Nice, nice.
[2656.49s -> 2657.53s]  I didn't do anything else.
[2658.51s -> 2659.23s]  My god.
[2660.52s -> 2662.73s]  Is all good to go for the next one?
[2662.73s -> 2664.17s]  Yeah, I'm ready, I'm ready.
[2664.17s -> 2665.74s]  All right, let's run it.
[2665.74s -> 2667.23s]  I'll just do this.
[2667.23s -> 2668.11s]  What's the next game mode?
[2671.05s -> 2672.25s]  Let me double check real quick.
[2672.25s -> 2673.29s]  It is going to be...
[2676.06s -> 2676.78s]  Oh, god.
[2678.49s -> 2679.13s]  Yeah, where are we going?
[2679.95s -> 2681.23s]  Domination hijack.
[2681.79s -> 2684.08s]  Ooh, should I use that?
[2684.08s -> 2686.08s]  That's the one where you take the points, right?
[2688.03s -> 2688.67s]  Yes.
[2688.67s -> 2690.59s]  Basically try to hold what, A and B?
[2690.59s -> 2696.01s]  A and B.
[2696.01s -> 2697.21s]  How do COD pros do this?
[2699.69s -> 2701.61s]  I don't know, it's a tough game.
[2701.61s -> 2702.89s]  It's a very, very quick game.
[2702.89s -> 2704.17s]  We're having fun and I'm stressed out.
[2706.81s -> 2709.15s]  I can't even think about a goddamn actual...
[2710.72s -> 2711.92s]  Yeah, it's tense.
[2711.92s -> 2714.00s]  There's absolutely no way I don't have diarrhea later.
[2714.00s -> 2714.56s]  Like, there's no way.
[2717.40s -> 2722.88s]  It's absolutely guaranteed.
[2722.88s -> 2728.38s]  I'll go for A here if we want to send people to B off the rip.
[2728.38s -> 2730.78s]  All right, I'll go to B and I'll go...
[2730.78s -> 2733.42s]  You know what I mean?
[2733.42s -> 2734.54s]  Yeah, I'm going to just push B.
[2734.54s -> 2735.42s]  Yeah, yeah.
[2735.42s -> 2736.38s]  I'm going to go to B and just go...
[2739.02s -> 2740.59s]  Good strat.
[2745.00s -> 2748.30s]  Nice.
[2749.77s -> 2751.61s]  Oh, okay, they're hard pushed left.
[2751.61s -> 2753.53s]  They're going in, they're going in.
[2753.53s -> 2756.14s]  Roger, stun aiding B.
[2756.94s -> 2758.06s]  Pushing out left.
[2758.06s -> 2759.10s]  They're right in this little area here.
[2761.02s -> 2762.06s]  I can't see anything.
[2763.58s -> 2763.82s]  What?
[2763.82s -> 2765.10s]  I got somebody.
[2765.82s -> 2766.22s]  What?
[2766.22s -> 2767.10s]  How am I still here?
[2768.52s -> 2769.80s]  Capping, capping, capping.
[2769.80s -> 2776.28s]  I'm holding...
[2776.28s -> 2777.08s]  I'm going to cap it.
[2777.08s -> 2778.76s]  Oh, no, I'm not.
[2778.76s -> 2779.63s]  I'm going in.
[2780.25s -> 2782.88s]  We got to get a wipe on them and then we got to go for it.
[2782.88s -> 2784.48s]  Oh, they're in the window up top.
[2784.48s -> 2785.12s]  Oh, they pushed through.
[2785.12s -> 2785.76s]  The fuckers.
[2789.00s -> 2789.72s]  Nading.
[2789.72s -> 2790.76s]  Got them out, got them off of it.
[2791.40s -> 2795.02s]  One is in our spawn.
[2795.02s -> 2796.14s]  They're behind us.
[2796.14s -> 2796.70s]  What?
[2796.70s -> 2797.02s]  Yeah.
[2799.29s -> 2800.57s]  Oh my God, the whole team's on B.
[2803.79s -> 2804.43s]  Excuse me?
[2805.15s -> 2807.77s]  Hey, this fucking guy's symphony, man.
[2807.77s -> 2808.97s]  They still haven't gotten B though yet.
[2808.97s -> 2809.93s]  We're still in this.
[2809.93s -> 2810.25s]  Yeah.
[2813.98s -> 2817.42s]  I'm going to go from the outside of the boat.
[2817.42s -> 2818.46s]  I'm going to get a little flank on.
[2819.74s -> 2821.02s]  They have somebody holding them across.
[2821.02s -> 2822.06s]  So as soon as you go to B, he's like...
[2822.06s -> 2823.26s]  I got those here, I got those here.
[2823.26s -> 2823.90s]  Yeah, I got them crossed.
[2823.90s -> 2824.54s]  Good shit, good shit.
[2824.54s -> 2824.78s]  All right.
[2824.78s -> 2825.34s]  I'm getting on site.
[2825.34s -> 2825.90s]  I'm getting on site.
[2825.90s -> 2826.62s]  We're getting on site.
[2826.62s -> 2827.66s]  Oh, they just threw a nade.
[2829.44s -> 2830.40s]  Ready to play good D?
[2830.40s -> 2831.92s]  I got one that threw a nade.
[2831.92s -> 2833.52s]  Oh, it's half capped.
[2833.52s -> 2834.02s]  Fuck.
[2836.00s -> 2836.50s]  Fuck.
[2838.32s -> 2839.28s]  Oh, right behind...
[2839.28s -> 2839.78s]  Oh, wow.
[2840.64s -> 2841.28s]  You know what I'm going to do?
[2841.28s -> 2842.88s]  I'm going to go for C cap.
[2842.88s -> 2846.25s]  I'm on it, I'm on it.
[2846.25s -> 2847.45s]  I'm on cap and B, cap and B, cap and B.
[2847.93s -> 2848.89s]  I need some support.
[2848.89s -> 2849.53s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[2849.53s -> 2850.49s]  I'm coming.
[2850.49s -> 2854.70s]  I'm pretty low.
[2854.70s -> 2855.90s]  I'm going to stay alive.
[2855.90s -> 2857.58s]  That's all we're going to do is stay alive.
[2858.30s -> 2858.80s]  True.
[2863.05s -> 2864.41s]  I think they're going left heavy.
[2865.13s -> 2866.57s]  Yeah, no, that's all they keep going.
[2867.29s -> 2868.25s]  Not the head camera on the right side.
[2868.25s -> 2868.81s]  I'm going to look long.
[2868.81s -> 2869.45s]  I'm going to look long.
[2870.49s -> 2871.21s]  I'm with you, okay?
[2871.21s -> 2872.01s]  All clear.
[2872.01s -> 2872.89s]  Oh, I almost got it.
[2872.89s -> 2873.39s]  Fuck.
[2875.55s -> 2876.43s]  On site, on site, on site.
[2876.43s -> 2877.87s]  Nade site, nade site.
[2877.87s -> 2878.19s]  Nading.
[2878.19s -> 2878.69s]  Oh.
[2879.47s -> 2880.11s]  Oh, I missed.
[2880.83s -> 2883.07s]  They're going to cap it, I think.
[2883.87s -> 2885.23s]  No, they're getting that.
[2886.03s -> 2886.43s]  No, I'm not.
[2886.43s -> 2886.75s]  I'm nading.
[2886.75s -> 2887.71s]  I'm nading, nading it.
[2887.71s -> 2888.21s]  Nice.
[2889.15s -> 2889.95s]  Oh, hit him.
[2889.95s -> 2890.43s]  Oh my God.
[2890.43s -> 2890.99s]  He's not dead.
[2894.16s -> 2895.04s]  Or spawn, or spawn.
[2895.04s -> 2895.92s]  I think we're going to flip.
[2895.92s -> 2897.20s]  Oh, they're at the right side, right side, right side.
[2899.79s -> 2900.67s]  I got to pull together here.
[2901.39s -> 2906.09s]  On the outside of the boat.
[2906.09s -> 2906.49s]  Got him.
[2906.49s -> 2907.29s]  Good shit, good shit.
[2907.29s -> 2907.85s]  All right, I got a...
[2908.65s -> 2912.25s]  I got three down.
[2912.25s -> 2913.93s]  Fucking the bitching window, man.
[2918.20s -> 2919.24s]  All right, good shit, good shit, good shit.
[2922.72s -> 2925.68s]  All right, I'm going to push through and try to hit B.
[2926.56s -> 2929.24s]  Hard right, hard right, hard right, hard right, hard right.
[2929.24s -> 2936.73s]  I'm watching them as they come out of the right side here.
[2936.73s -> 2937.69s]  I'm going to try to hold down.
[2937.69s -> 2939.85s]  We might be able to get on site a little bit.
[2940.49s -> 2943.13s]  Oh, there's somebody on our side, second floor.
[2945.50s -> 2946.14s]  Fuck you, John.
[2957.58s -> 2958.62s]  Oh, I hit him in the head.
[2959.18s -> 2960.72s]  I'm in our window trying to hold it down.
[2961.52s -> 2969.40s]  Behind, behind, behind.
[2970.04s -> 2974.43s]  That's on my own team, man.
[2975.15s -> 2976.11s]  Good shit, good shit, good shit.
[2976.11s -> 2978.19s]  I'm trying to hold for you.
[2979.15s -> 2980.51s]  I'm right there.
[2980.51s -> 2981.23s]  Fuck.
[2981.23s -> 2982.32s]  No, no, no, no.
[2982.32s -> 2983.28s]  It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[2983.28s -> 2983.60s]  I'm here.
[2985.28s -> 2989.34s]  I'm going to go inside mid to your left.
[2990.86s -> 2993.74s]  I got one.
[2993.74s -> 2994.78s]  Good shit, good shit, good shit.
[2994.78s -> 2995.10s]  Another time.
[2995.10s -> 2995.90s]  Now is our fucking time.
[2995.90s -> 2996.38s]  I'm pushing inside.
[2996.38s -> 2998.30s]  Behind, behind, behind, behind, behind us.
[2999.90s -> 3000.38s]  Behind where?
[3001.18s -> 3001.58s]  Behind B.
[3002.30s -> 3003.18s]  Our window.
[3003.18s -> 3003.98s]  I'm holding, I'm holding.
[3003.98s -> 3005.10s]  Almost there, almost there, almost there.
[3005.10s -> 3005.50s]  All right.
[3005.50s -> 3007.02s]  They're on top of our yacht, by the way.
[3007.02s -> 3009.04s]  I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.
[3009.04s -> 3009.60s]  Oh.
[3009.60s -> 3010.40s]  Got one.
[3010.40s -> 3012.78s]  Where am I getting shot from?
[3012.78s -> 3016.75s]  Fuck.
[3016.75s -> 3017.07s]  Okay.
[3017.87s -> 3019.15s]  There's so many chairs in the fucking way.
[3019.95s -> 3022.30s]  Did you try to push around?
[3022.30s -> 3022.78s]  I got him.
[3022.78s -> 3023.90s]  Wait, we have sight.
[3023.90s -> 3025.02s]  Yeah, no, I got it.
[3025.02s -> 3025.66s]  Wait, that's good.
[3026.46s -> 3033.05s]  I think we could actually make a comeback here.
[3034.32s -> 3035.04s]  Let's hold on to it.
[3038.36s -> 3039.24s]  Oh, no, we didn't.
[3039.24s -> 3040.44s]  We didn't hold in long enough.
[3040.44s -> 3041.40s]  Oh, I did bad.
[3041.40s -> 3042.36s]  I was very bad.
[3042.36s -> 3042.92s]  No, it's okay.
[3042.92s -> 3044.28s]  We go other side.
[3044.92s -> 3046.83s]  Thanks for the raid, Connor.
[3046.83s -> 3050.19s]  So, you swap spawns.
[3050.19s -> 3050.75s]  Thanks for the raid.
[3050.75s -> 3051.98s]  Yep.
[3051.98s -> 3053.10s]  Currently playing Call of Duty.
[3054.22s -> 3055.58s]  I did much better last game.
[3055.58s -> 3057.98s]  I was in like second or third place on the team last game.
[3057.98s -> 3058.86s]  Nuketown was my map.
[3058.86s -> 3059.98s]  Somebody's just having a fucking match here.
[3059.98s -> 3060.30s]  Let's go.
[3060.30s -> 3060.70s]  Let's go.
[3060.70s -> 3061.18s]  Let's go.
[3061.18s -> 3061.66s]  Thanks for the raid.
[3061.66s -> 3062.22s]  Welcome, everybody.
[3062.22s -> 3063.90s]  I think all he's been, he's just been a little rat.
[3063.90s -> 3064.62s]  I'm going to hit C here.
[3065.18s -> 3066.19s]  I'm going to go long.
[3066.83s -> 3068.59s]  I'm going to try to play flanks like Sim did
[3068.59s -> 3070.03s]  and try to cut him off of his bullshit.
[3071.36s -> 3072.80s]  So, I'm going to just try to hold left.
[3072.80s -> 3074.08s]  The symphony is crazy.
[3074.80s -> 3075.52s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3075.52s -> 3077.58s]  I'm going to fucking put an end to him.
[3078.30s -> 3079.10s]  Up the window.
[3079.10s -> 3079.66s]  Their window.
[3079.66s -> 3080.38s]  Their up window.
[3090.70s -> 3091.26s]  I'm taking A.
[3092.64s -> 3093.20s]  Yeah, do that.
[3093.20s -> 3093.92s]  And I'm going to go for B.
[3094.72s -> 3095.63s]  I got him.
[3096.59s -> 3097.55s]  Nice, nice, nice.
[3097.55s -> 3098.43s]  Got it.
[3098.43s -> 3100.11s]  Where are they spawning?
[3100.11s -> 3101.07s]  Oh, no, this is scary.
[3101.07s -> 3102.03s]  Well, we're going to triple cap.
[3102.03s -> 3102.83s]  Holy fuck.
[3102.83s -> 3103.39s]  Let's go.
[3103.39s -> 3104.19s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[3104.91s -> 3105.69s]  It's XC.
[3105.69s -> 3106.33s]  It's XC.
[3106.33s -> 3107.53s]  They're behind, behind, behind.
[3107.53s -> 3109.29s]  They're near A, I think.
[3109.29s -> 3110.17s]  What's ours?
[3110.17s -> 3111.13s]  You got A and C.
[3111.13s -> 3111.93s]  I'm going to see them.
[3111.93s -> 3113.37s]  I got C, I got C, I got C, I got C.
[3113.93s -> 3114.65s]  They're capping B as well.
[3114.65s -> 3115.37s]  What the fuck?
[3115.37s -> 3116.01s]  Could you get them off?
[3116.65s -> 3119.12s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[3119.12s -> 3119.92s]  He's going back to C.
[3119.92s -> 3120.48s]  He's going back to C.
[3120.48s -> 3121.04s]  He's back on C.
[3121.04s -> 3121.52s]  Back on C.
[3129.56s -> 3130.84s]  Yeah, see the soul.
[3130.84s -> 3131.96s]  What the fuck, man?
[3134.80s -> 3135.44s]  I'm on B.
[3135.44s -> 3136.08s]  Oh, shit.
[3136.72s -> 3137.52s]  I just don't know this map.
[3138.48s -> 3140.96s]  I just don't know where they're coming from.
[3140.96s -> 3142.00s]  Can they spawn behind us?
[3143.74s -> 3145.02s]  Not when we have, like, C cap.
[3145.02s -> 3146.38s]  They're just running here.
[3146.38s -> 3148.94s]  Look, we just need to have people on both lanes.
[3150.14s -> 3151.18s]  Oh, my God.
[3159.39s -> 3161.55s]  Second floor, second floor, second floor.
[3161.55s -> 3162.35s]  Across from theirs.
[3162.91s -> 3167.69s]  All right.
[3167.69s -> 3169.77s]  When you guys spawn at C, I want everyone to push out
[3169.77s -> 3171.53s]  of the right side for this next one.
[3173.53s -> 3181.20s]  They're inside of, like, the windows area
[3181.20s -> 3184.57s]  with the fucking mattress going in.
[3185.13s -> 3187.21s]  Yeah, somebody's holding in that little cubby.
[3187.53s -> 3188.41s]  There's two people in there.
[3188.41s -> 3189.77s]  We need to clear out that room.
[3189.77s -> 3190.89s]  We have to clear out that room.
[3192.00s -> 3192.64s]  Oh, they're on C.
[3192.64s -> 3193.04s]  They're on C.
[3193.04s -> 3193.92s]  They're going to make us flip.
[3194.97s -> 3195.77s]  Yep, they made us flip.
[3196.41s -> 3197.52s]  I'm going to take A then.
[3199.92s -> 3200.64s]  We have B.
[3200.64s -> 3201.28s]  I got that.
[3201.28s -> 3202.16s]  Right room is clear.
[3203.55s -> 3204.27s]  One more in there.
[3204.27s -> 3204.83s]  Oh, no, nice.
[3204.83s -> 3205.15s]  Nice.
[3205.79s -> 3209.47s]  All right, we're getting A, right?
[3209.47s -> 3210.27s]  I'm going for A right now.
[3210.27s -> 3210.67s]  I was.
[3210.67s -> 3211.71s]  I almost got A.
[3212.51s -> 3213.31s]  Two entering.
[3213.31s -> 3213.71s]  I'm on A.
[3213.71s -> 3214.03s]  I'm on A.
[3215.04s -> 3215.36s]  Nice.
[3216.16s -> 3216.96s]  I don't know where anybody is.
[3216.96s -> 3217.44s]  I'm coming to help you.
[3217.44s -> 3218.32s]  I'm coming to help you.
[3218.32s -> 3219.52s]  Halfway, halfway, halfway.
[3219.52s -> 3221.15s]  They're wrapping around the side here.
[3221.15s -> 3222.22s]  Got it.
[3222.22s -> 3222.70s]  Nice.
[3222.70s -> 3224.76s]  I'm going to just help hold down B.
[3226.09s -> 3226.65s]  Yeah, hold down B.
[3226.65s -> 3227.29s]  Hold down B.
[3227.29s -> 3228.33s]  I'm going to look long.
[3228.33s -> 3230.43s]  On B, on B, on B.
[3230.43s -> 3231.31s]  Oh, one's on B.
[3231.31s -> 3231.95s]  On B, on B.
[3231.95s -> 3232.75s]  There's two of them on B.
[3233.85s -> 3234.65s]  Good shit, good shit.
[3234.65s -> 3236.01s]  God, good shit, you know.
[3237.16s -> 3237.88s]  Oh, God.
[3239.71s -> 3240.19s]  Capping.
[3243.05s -> 3244.09s]  Second floor, underside.
[3244.97s -> 3245.21s]  No!
[3246.81s -> 3247.45s]  Where?
[3247.45s -> 3248.89s]  Oh, just worse.
[3248.89s -> 3249.85s]  Oh, we got B, though.
[3249.85s -> 3250.65s]  We got B.
[3250.65s -> 3250.97s]  We're good.
[3250.97s -> 3251.45s]  We got B.
[3251.45s -> 3252.01s]  Oh, they're taking B.
[3252.01s -> 3252.49s]  They're taking B.
[3252.49s -> 3252.97s]  Nade, nade, nade.
[3252.97s -> 3253.45s]  No, no, no.
[3253.45s -> 3254.25s]  I'm here, I'm here.
[3254.25s -> 3254.81s]  Nobody's here.
[3254.81s -> 3256.73s]  Oh, they haven't taken A yet.
[3256.81s -> 3257.77s]  Oh, they're on A.
[3257.77s -> 3258.41s]  They're on A.
[3258.41s -> 3259.13s]  They are on A.
[3260.43s -> 3260.99s]  Okay.
[3260.99s -> 3261.95s]  Wait, wait, no, they're not.
[3261.95s -> 3262.19s]  Long.
[3262.19s -> 3262.75s]  Wait, what?
[3262.75s -> 3263.79s]  I just got something behind me.
[3265.40s -> 3266.36s]  Yeah, he's coming into B right now.
[3266.36s -> 3267.56s]  He's coming into B right now.
[3267.56s -> 3269.92s]  We're good.
[3269.92s -> 3270.48s]  Okay.
[3270.48s -> 3271.45s]  We're clear, clear, clear.
[3271.45s -> 3272.41s]  I just got shot at A.
[3272.41s -> 3273.29s]  Yeah, we're good, we're good.
[3273.29s -> 3274.09s]  Yeah, I got shot at A.
[3274.09s -> 3274.65s]  They're taking A.
[3275.21s -> 3275.53s]  Okay.
[3276.09s -> 3278.43s]  Got him, got him, got him, got him.
[3281.85s -> 3282.73s]  All right, one's inside.
[3282.73s -> 3283.45s]  He's going to A right now.
[3283.45s -> 3284.09s]  He's going to A.
[3284.09s -> 3284.81s]  Oh, they're on B, man.
[3284.81s -> 3285.53s]  Good shit, good shit, good shit.
[3286.72s -> 3287.60s]  Anybody got a B?
[3288.16s -> 3288.96s]  Anybody got a nade on B?
[3294.88s -> 3295.60s]  Oh, shit.
[3306.99s -> 3308.35s]  Why did I throw the grenade?
[3308.91s -> 3315.48s]  All right, we're going to take it back.
[3315.48s -> 3316.44s]  We're going to take it back.
[3316.44s -> 3322.25s]  Shake it, shake it, shake it.
[3322.25s -> 3322.49s]  Go, go, go.
[3322.49s -> 3324.49s]  Oh, behind you in the fucking window house.
[3324.49s -> 3325.45s]  Oh, they're coming left side.
[3326.41s -> 3327.29s]  They're in the left house.
[3329.69s -> 3330.89s]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[3332.89s -> 3333.29s]  Nice.
[3333.29s -> 3334.17s]  They're back on though.
[3335.56s -> 3336.52s]  We just need a nade in there.
[3336.52s -> 3337.24s]  We just need it.
[3337.24s -> 3338.36s]  Oh, they're taking it back.
[3338.36s -> 3339.48s]  They're taking it.
[3339.48s -> 3339.96s]  Oh, God.
[3339.96s -> 3340.60s]  They're holding long.
[3345.36s -> 3345.68s]  Shit.
[3346.40s -> 3348.33s]  They're fucking holding that shit.
[3351.87s -> 3352.19s]  Damn it.
[3357.24s -> 3358.04s]  I'm playing so bad.
[3360.22s -> 3362.64s]  This dude is shot at 360.
[3362.64s -> 3363.52s]  Don't scope right now.
[3364.08s -> 3364.88s]  Jesus.
[3364.88s -> 3365.76s]  Oh, God.
[3367.36s -> 3369.18s]  Sorry, I had 13 kills.
[3370.20s -> 3371.08s]  Now this series.
[3371.08s -> 3371.72s]  Yeah.
[3371.72s -> 3372.92s]  So they took series one.
[3375.29s -> 3376.25s]  Oh, my God.
[3377.90s -> 3381.18s]  It's one of those maps where it's just there's so much sight
[3381.18s -> 3386.86s]  that somebody can just be like 70 and 24 down like that.
[3386.86s -> 3387.98s]  The right and left hallways.
[3389.15s -> 3392.51s]  Symphony is single-handedly carrying that team.
[3392.51s -> 3394.43s]  They're in a Jansport backpack right now.
[3394.43s -> 3397.63s]  I think all of us literally outfrag the entire team
[3397.63s -> 3398.91s]  if it wasn't for Symphony.
[3401.31s -> 3407.48s]  Hey, I did all right the first game.
[3407.48s -> 3409.16s]  Second game, I just kept getting picked off.
[3410.09s -> 3410.49s]  All good.
[3411.21s -> 3413.48s]  All good, all good.
[3413.48s -> 3430.04s]  I just looked like one of those people that was about to like
[3430.04s -> 3433.58s]  you knew that I was about to hold down the voice chat
[3433.58s -> 3444.73s]  and be like, hey, the microphone symbol
[3444.73s -> 3445.93s]  was about to appear above my head.
[3458.04s -> 3460.92s]  Maybe lost connection.
[3460.92s -> 3461.48s]  Good.
[3461.48s -> 3465.42s]  Holy, I need to seriously put on.
[3465.42s -> 3474.88s]  Just got banned.
[3474.88s -> 3475.44s]  No.
[3475.44s -> 3479.68s]  Wait, are you guys still on the server?
[3479.68s -> 3480.56s]  No, I'm not.
[3480.56s -> 3491.93s]  Oh, yeah.
[3491.93s -> 3493.45s]  No, Call of Duty is really fun.
[3494.73s -> 3497.53s]  I got to get like in the only way you can really play
[3497.53s -> 3501.66s]  Call of Duty is if you just don't blink for 30 straight seconds.
[3501.66s -> 3502.76s]  You know what I mean?
[3502.76s -> 3504.92s]  Like you have to lock in and just be like
[3504.92s -> 3512.41s]  it's the only way you can play that you don't take.
[3512.41s -> 3519.96s]  Oh, game crashed.
[3519.96s -> 3524.30s]  Oh, hold on.
[3524.30s -> 3525.02s]  Crash.
[3525.02s -> 3528.86s]  But you just have to sit there and be like.
[3535.74s -> 3539.79s]  It's like you just see like the matrix symbols.
[3539.79s -> 3541.63s]  Okay, I'm going to open it back up.
[3541.63s -> 3546.40s]  Yeah, the second you blink and Call of Duty
[3546.40s -> 3548.32s]  is when you're at the response screen.
[3548.32s -> 3554.91s]  Stop, you're embarrassing this community.
[3554.91s -> 3555.71s]  Nobody can hear me.
[3555.71s -> 3556.75s]  It's just only you can hear me.
[3556.75s -> 3558.03s]  You're embarrassing yourself in front of you guys.
[3571.45s -> 3574.88s]  I like popped off in that first game, though.
[3574.88s -> 3575.60s]  I did.
[3575.60s -> 3577.79s]  I got to get that back, right?
[3577.79s -> 3580.03s]  You got to get that Cod mindset back.
[3580.03s -> 3584.22s]  And it's called don't fucking throw grenades
[3584.22s -> 3586.46s]  and walk into the room, right?
[3586.46s -> 3588.70s]  Like I've done that like three times.
[3588.70s -> 3603.45s]  I'm going to try this weapon.
[3603.45s -> 3606.73s]  We're back in, right?
[3606.73s -> 3607.45s]  We're back.
[3607.45s -> 3624.19s]  Oh, my God, I'm terrible.
[3624.19s -> 3634.46s]  Maybe just turn my sensitivity down.
[3634.46s -> 3664.83s]  You guys remember when I hosted the 13 and 7 kill command gameplay?
[3665.07s -> 3666.75s]  In like 2013.
[3666.75s -> 3674.67s]  Oh, I thought there was somebody lying there.
[3674.67s -> 3675.17s]  Yeah.
[3676.73s -> 3678.33s]  Yeah, I think I remember.
[3678.33s -> 3678.81s]  Oh, shit.
[3678.81s -> 3679.45s]  Sorry.
[3679.45s -> 3680.17s]  I thought I was muted.
[3680.91s -> 3682.19s]  Oh, no, no, you're fine.
[3682.19s -> 3683.87s]  You're oh, you were talking to chat.
[3683.87s -> 3684.67s]  I was just talking.
[3684.67s -> 3686.03s]  Okay.
[3686.03s -> 3686.83s]  No, that's fine.
[3686.83s -> 3691.32s]  I was just I was like, I don't it's a long time ago.
[3691.32s -> 3695.37s]  So you play multiverses, right?
[3695.37s -> 3696.01s]  Yeah, a little bit.
[3696.01s -> 3697.29s]  I'm not great at it.
[3697.29s -> 3698.41s]  What do you like the first?
[3698.97s -> 3699.69s]  Oh, what's up?
[3699.69s -> 3701.24s]  What do you play with?
[3701.24s -> 3703.05s]  Oh, Shaggy.
[3703.05s -> 3703.77s]  Kind of cool.
[3703.77s -> 3705.98s]  It's a good pick.
[3705.98s -> 3708.78s]  It's the only fighting game I've ever really gotten into.
[3708.78s -> 3711.66s]  I feel like Smash was too complicated for me.
[3712.46s -> 3714.54s]  Yeah, no, it kind of is a little too many.
[3715.42s -> 3717.26s]  Too many particle effects, too.
[3717.26s -> 3725.82s]  I feel like there's a steeper curve when you first learn Smash kind of thing.
[3725.82s -> 3729.10s]  There's also like 150 characters, right?
[3729.10s -> 3732.70s]  So yeah, learning what every single person does is kind of hard when you,
[3732.70s -> 3734.54s]  you know, there's like 80 characters.
[3734.54s -> 3751.08s]  There's a lot of headshots and no kills.
[3766.24s -> 3767.28s]  Switch the gun.
[3767.28s -> 3768.16s]  Knife.
[3768.16s -> 3769.12s]  Does this gun suck?
[3770.49s -> 3771.13s]  Okay.
[3771.13s -> 3774.89s]  All right.
[3774.89s -> 3776.49s]  This is chat makes my gun.
[3777.50s -> 3778.06s]  Okay.
[3778.06s -> 3779.10s]  Chat makes my gun.
[3781.79s -> 3782.75s]  You've seen how I play.
[3782.75s -> 3784.19s]  You've seen how, what I do.
[3784.19s -> 3790.00s]  I need you guys to, I'm going to make, I'm going to go class.
[3790.00s -> 3790.72s]  Okay.

[3791.68s -> 3793.60s]  Please.
[3793.60s -> 3793.92s]  Okay.
[3793.92s -> 3794.64s]  We're going to go here.
[3796.60s -> 3797.64s]  Let's just take this.
[3797.64s -> 3800.57s]  What should I use?
[3800.57s -> 3801.85s]  I'm seeing a lot of MP7.
[3801.85s -> 3802.33s]  MP7.
[3802.33s -> 3806.48s]  MP7.
[3806.48s -> 3807.04s]  MP7.
[3807.04s -> 3808.88s]  Every time I get a knife, I think of Among Us.
[3812.12s -> 3815.37s]  One's in the chat if I should, if MP7.
[3815.37s -> 3817.61s]  Definitely, definitely what I think of too.
[3820.08s -> 3821.36s]  Or MSMC.
[3821.36s -> 3822.00s]  I'm seeing a lot.
[3822.00s -> 3823.74s]  You know, you're joking.
[3823.74s -> 3825.29s]  MSMC.
[3825.29s -> 3830.30s]  If it's from the back, it kind of reminds me of, yeah.
[3830.30s -> 3830.78s]  Okay.
[3830.78s -> 3832.70s]  I've seen a lot of, I've seen a lot of this.
[3832.70s -> 3832.94s]  Okay.
[3832.94s -> 3834.86s]  What attachments for the MSMC?
[3834.86s -> 3836.60s]  Yeah, Jeremiah, you almost ready?
[3836.60s -> 3838.28s]  Or are you doing some class stuff?
[3838.28s -> 3839.00s]  I'm just changing class.
[3839.00s -> 3840.36s]  I'll be maybe two seconds.
[3840.36s -> 3841.04s]  Okay.
[3841.04s -> 3841.52s]  It's all good.
[3841.52s -> 3844.64s]  Just whenever, just whenever it is that you're ready, join the server and I'll know.
[3844.64s -> 3844.96s]  Yep.
[3844.96s -> 3845.76s]  To run it out.
[3847.21s -> 3847.53s]  All right.
[3847.53s -> 3848.49s]  Attachments.
[3848.49s -> 3851.68s]  What am I putting on this?
[3851.68s -> 3852.64s]  Long barrel.
[3852.64s -> 3854.83s]  Okay.
[3854.83s -> 3862.12s]  And laser, laser and laser sight and long barrel.
[3862.12s -> 3870.60s]  What about perks?
[3870.60s -> 3871.40s]  Quick, hurry, hurry.
[3871.40s -> 3872.20s]  They're waiting on you.
[3872.20s -> 3874.06s]  They're waiting on you.
[3874.06s -> 3876.84s]  Ghost.
[3876.84s -> 3879.50s]  Lightweight.
[3879.50s -> 3879.82s]  Okay.
[3879.82s -> 3885.56s]  Lightweight.
[3885.56s -> 3886.04s]  Toughness.
[3889.02s -> 3889.98s]  Scavenger.
[3889.98s -> 3891.53s]  Okay.

[3903.66s -> 3907.18s]  All right.
[3907.18s -> 3908.22s]  Tactical mask.
[3908.22s -> 3910.44s]  Dexterity.
[3910.44s -> 3911.24s]  All right.
[3911.24s -> 3911.96s]  And that's it, right?
[3911.96s -> 3912.44s]  We're done.
[3912.44s -> 3912.84s]  We're good.
[3912.84s -> 3913.32s]  That's it.
[3913.32s -> 3914.75s]  All right.
[3914.75s -> 3915.39s]  We're good.
[3915.39s -> 3916.62s]  What's this?
[3916.62s -> 3917.18s]  Oops.
[3917.18s -> 3920.52s]  Where we going?
[3920.52s -> 3920.76s]  Okay.
[3920.76s -> 3921.56s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3921.56s -> 3921.88s]  I'm ready.
[3921.88s -> 3922.12s]  I'm ready.
[3922.12s -> 3922.68s]  I'm ready.
[3922.68s -> 3924.06s]  Okay.
[3924.06s -> 3924.78s]  Let's go.
[3924.78s -> 3928.12s]  All right.
[3928.12s -> 3929.00s]  I'm coming back in.
[3929.00s -> 3933.93s]  Chad has a good selection for me, I guess.
[3933.93s -> 3938.70s]  Yeah.
[3938.70s -> 3940.54s]  I mostly just left mine the same.
[3940.54s -> 3948.49s]  This thing's a piece of dog shit.
[3948.49s -> 3951.53s]  Thanks, guys.
[3951.53s -> 3951.93s]  They made...
[3951.93s -> 3953.21s]  Let me change one thing.
[3953.21s -> 3954.25s]  What would they make you do?
[3955.69s -> 3956.41s]  Can you just make...
[3956.41s -> 3956.65s]  Okay.
[3956.65s -> 3959.29s]  Sakuna, they said the M...
[3959.29s -> 3959.85s]  What's this thing called?
[3959.85s -> 3961.13s]  The MSMC?
[3962.84s -> 3963.72s]  Yeah, that's a good gun.
[3963.72s -> 3964.20s]  Oh, okay.
[3964.20s -> 3965.00s]  That's pretty good, isn't it?
[3965.00s -> 3966.73s]  I think.
[3966.73s -> 3969.29s]  With a long, long barrel and...
[3974.11s -> 3975.63s]  Long barrel and laser sight.
[3975.63s -> 3987.39s]  Laser sight.
[3987.39s -> 3989.31s]  No, maybe I'll try that one, too.
[3989.31s -> 3990.03s]  Oh, all right.
[3990.03s -> 3990.67s]  And it's...
[3990.67s -> 3995.63s]  Yeah, I mean, if Chad said it's good, it's got to be.
[3995.63s -> 3996.43s]  I usually trust him.
[3996.43s -> 3997.55s]  Chad's never wrong.
[3997.55s -> 3999.80s]  That's got to be.
[3999.80s -> 4000.92s]  I'm going to try it, too.
[4000.92s -> 4013.92s]  I love these stuns, man.
[4015.56s -> 4017.16s]  They last 10 years, I swear.
[4018.04s -> 4034.27s]  Team, you guys good to go?
[4035.68s -> 4036.32s]  Yep, I'm ready.
[4036.32s -> 4036.96s]  I think so, yeah.
[4036.96s -> 4042.25s]  All right, cool.
[4042.25s -> 4043.05s]  Starting it up.
[4043.05s -> 4055.53s]  Somebody said, why are there NFP ads on my stream?
[4055.53s -> 4055.85s]  There aren't.
[4055.85s -> 4058.03s]  What are you talking about?
[4058.03s -> 4058.84s]  Right.
[4058.84s -> 4062.92s]  If we hold mid, this is the easiest fucking one of our life.
[4063.48s -> 4064.20s]  All right, let's go for it.
[4064.20s -> 4064.60s]  All right.
[4065.00s -> 4066.91s]  Let's get it.
[4066.91s -> 4068.27s]  Mid control.
[4068.27s -> 4071.13s]  Play your life and control mid.
[4071.13s -> 4072.17s]  Name of the fucking game.
[4072.17s -> 4072.65s]  Let's get it.
[4075.07s -> 4078.36s]  If I die three times in a row, I'm changing back to my tried and true.
[4078.36s -> 4079.32s]  Yeah, same, same.
[4081.72s -> 4083.80s]  We're both trying the MSC thing?
[4083.80s -> 4087.07s]  Yeah, MSMC with long barrel and laser sight.
[4087.07s -> 4088.46s]  I'm doing that early.
[4088.46s -> 4089.02s]  That'll work.
[4089.02s -> 4090.46s]  84, 89?
[4090.46s -> 4091.18s]  94.
[4091.18s -> 4095.80s]  Okay, so the laser sight, I'm assuming you don't scope in anymore or...?
[4097.84s -> 4098.48s]  I don't know.
[4098.48s -> 4102.99s]  Oh, baby.
[4103.71s -> 4105.63s]  I want to get a fucking cross map, Nate.
[4105.63s -> 4106.67s]  Set us off right, you know?
[4107.23s -> 4110.83s]  You just throw the Tomahawk.
[4110.83s -> 4111.95s]  Cross map.
[4111.95s -> 4112.35s]  Me too.
[4116.99s -> 4118.59s]  Is that mid cap first?
[4118.59s -> 4122.88s]  I got traded.
[4122.88s -> 4123.60s]  Holy fuck.
[4124.16s -> 4127.55s]  Watch that left side.
[4128.88s -> 4130.28s]  Nated.
[4130.28s -> 4131.64s]  We got control left.
[4131.64s -> 4132.44s]  I'm going mid here.
[4133.00s -> 4134.04s]  I just couldn't see.
[4134.04s -> 4135.56s]  Point in the back, point in the back, point in the back.
[4140.14s -> 4141.02s]  Nice.
[4141.02s -> 4142.96s]  I feel like we flipped spawns, right?
[4142.96s -> 4143.52s]  Oh my god, the stuns.
[4143.52s -> 4144.64s]  We did, we did, we did.
[4144.64s -> 4145.68s]  The stun.
[4145.68s -> 4146.40s]  I'm holding mid.
[4149.12s -> 4149.60s]  Got one.
[4157.95s -> 4159.23s]  Let me know if you guys need cover right.
[4159.23s -> 4160.19s]  Watch out, we're on the fountain.
[4161.15s -> 4162.19s]  Got him, got him, got him.
[4162.19s -> 4162.83s]  Good, good, good.
[4163.39s -> 4164.27s]  I think we flipped again.
[4164.99s -> 4171.88s]  Symphony, suck my dick, bitch.
[4172.76s -> 4173.24s]  All day.
[4175.16s -> 4176.36s]  On these fucking nuts.
[4176.36s -> 4177.72s]  Where's the ammo in...
[4177.72s -> 4178.76s]  I sound like a baby.
[4179.56s -> 4180.12s]  I spawn on new...
[4182.16s -> 4183.68s]  Mommy, where's my ammo?
[4183.68s -> 4184.48s]  Where's the ammo?
[4184.48s -> 4186.24s]  He's pulling it back out of the fountain.
[4186.24s -> 4188.78s]  I'm on point, I'm on point, point, flip, point, flip.
[4188.78s -> 4190.06s]  I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.
[4190.06s -> 4195.21s]  He's gonna be left side.
[4195.21s -> 4196.49s]  This is good for us right here.
[4198.03s -> 4199.31s]  Stuck this dick, Simp!
[4200.03s -> 4202.62s]  Hold that fountain.
[4203.34s -> 4206.72s]  I got you, I got, I got, I got point, I got point.
[4206.72s -> 4207.20s]  All day.
[4207.76s -> 4212.86s]  Hold that concussion, bitch.
[4213.50s -> 4216.80s]  Behind, behind, behind, behind.
[4216.80s -> 4217.98s]  Behind point.
[4217.98s -> 4218.62s]  Oh, are they moving?
[4219.66s -> 4222.97s]  Fuck, they got point.
[4222.97s -> 4224.97s]  Up 40, let's take that shit back.
[4224.97s -> 4226.80s]  I'm down to take it from street.
[4226.80s -> 4228.08s]  The left side with Shikuno.
[4228.08s -> 4229.12s]  I'm with you, Syke.
[4229.12s -> 4229.95s]  Yeah, I don't see it.
[4229.95s -> 4231.07s]  All right, I hear somebody over here.
[4231.07s -> 4237.15s]  Oh, that's two.
[4237.71s -> 4239.31s]  Jesus, Symphony's crazy, man.
[4239.31s -> 4240.27s]  Point flip, point flip.
[4240.27s -> 4241.23s]  Oh, right here, right here, right here.
[4243.39s -> 4244.27s]  I got him on a leash, Syke.
[4244.27s -> 4245.23s]  I got him on a leash.
[4245.23s -> 4246.41s]  I'm behind.
[4246.41s -> 4246.81s]  Got one.
[4249.21s -> 4250.17s]  I got two in that room.
[4250.17s -> 4250.65s]  Good trades.
[4250.65s -> 4251.21s]  Nice, nice.
[4251.21s -> 4252.09s]  I just watched you do that.
[4252.09s -> 4254.99s]  I'm coming to help point.
[4254.99s -> 4256.11s]  Oh, he's on point.
[4256.11s -> 4256.91s]  I can cuss one.
[4256.91s -> 4257.71s]  Behind the truck.
[4259.74s -> 4260.38s]  Behind, behind, behind.
[4261.53s -> 4263.29s]  Oh, yep, it's Sim right there.
[4267.07s -> 4268.19s]  Nading site.
[4268.19s -> 4270.75s]  Let's wait till we all respawn and make a push together.
[4270.75s -> 4272.57s]  All right, let's do this.
[4272.57s -> 4273.13s]  We're grouped.
[4273.69s -> 4275.45s]  Got one, I got Sim.
[4275.45s -> 4276.33s]  Good shit, let's go.
[4278.65s -> 4280.81s]  One back, three back in the right side spawn.
[4280.81s -> 4282.57s]  Oh, I got hit right in the fucking head.
[4282.57s -> 4283.13s]  Why what?
[4283.13s -> 4285.61s]  Oh, no, Blau just teared us apart.
[4286.49s -> 4288.57s]  Hardpoint switch and going offline in 10.
[4288.57s -> 4290.17s]  We play for the next one, which I think is mid.
[4290.57s -> 4292.84s]  So let's just get mid control right now.
[4292.84s -> 4293.88s]  Fuck this next point.
[4293.88s -> 4297.60s]  Or fuck the point that's currently up.
[4297.60s -> 4299.47s]  I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it.
[4299.47s -> 4300.75s]  Mechanical damage, I'm dead.
[4302.17s -> 4303.77s]  All right, rolling with you.
[4303.77s -> 4307.76s]  I see where they're rotating from.
[4308.72s -> 4310.59s]  Oh, I need to switch gun here.
[4311.15s -> 4319.15s]  Let's go, Dean, I'm on you.
[4319.15s -> 4319.95s]  I'm with you, I'm with you.
[4319.95s -> 4320.67s]  Yeah, I got you, I got you.
[4320.67s -> 4321.71s]  I'm on nade in the side.
[4321.71s -> 4322.67s]  Together, bro.
[4322.67s -> 4324.11s]  Oh, my God, was he in that room?
[4324.11s -> 4324.67s]  Oh, nade inside, though.
[4324.67s -> 4325.39s]  Oh, he was holding that.
[4325.39s -> 4325.87s]  He's in the back.
[4325.87s -> 4327.07s]  He's in the back alley, back alley, back alley.
[4327.07s -> 4327.57s]  Got one.
[4328.43s -> 4328.91s]  Okay.
[4328.91s -> 4330.19s]  Oh, God, the stuns.
[4330.83s -> 4331.31s]  I'm going.
[4331.39s -> 4332.19s]  Oh, shit.
[4333.69s -> 4334.73s]  What the fuck?
[4334.73s -> 4335.45s]  Where did he come from?
[4335.45s -> 4337.61s]  One coming in.
[4337.61s -> 4338.01s]  Nice.
[4339.52s -> 4339.92s]  P.O.P.
[4339.92s -> 4340.72s]  Let's hold this shit down.
[4342.83s -> 4343.33s]  Yeah.
[4344.19s -> 4345.23s]  I'll watch the back side.
[4347.23s -> 4347.73s]  Got one.
[4349.07s -> 4350.11s]  He went back alley, back alley.
[4350.11s -> 4350.75s]  Symphony went back.
[4350.75s -> 4351.47s]  There it goes.
[4351.47s -> 4351.97s]  Roger.
[4353.87s -> 4356.43s]  Oops.
[4356.43s -> 4357.31s]  I got blah on it.
[4358.19s -> 4358.51s]  Nice.
[4358.51s -> 4359.15s]  We're up, baby.
[4359.15s -> 4359.55s]  We're up.
[4360.43s -> 4361.63s]  All right, we got to take over mid again.
[4362.51s -> 4362.99s]  Back left.
[4362.99s -> 4363.49s]  Oh, God.
[4363.95s -> 4368.52s]  Okay, I'm going to push out mid here.
[4370.25s -> 4373.58s]  Yikes.
[4373.98s -> 4378.65s]  John, your fucking knife, man.
[4378.65s -> 4379.13s]  I'm nading.
[4379.13s -> 4380.41s]  They're like, I'm sorry.
[4380.41s -> 4380.97s]  I just ruined you.
[4380.97s -> 4381.29s]  Sorry.
[4381.29s -> 4382.01s]  No, it's okay.
[4384.32s -> 4385.44s]  God damn it.
[4385.44s -> 4386.40s]  I'm being so careful.
[4386.40s -> 4388.08s]  And all of a sudden, I get instantly killed.
[4389.76s -> 4390.56s]  Got another.
[4390.56s -> 4391.04s]  He's back.
[4391.04s -> 4391.36s]  It's clear.
[4393.04s -> 4393.52s]  Got another.
[4393.52s -> 4394.24s]  One more, one more.
[4394.24s -> 4395.76s]  On side, on side, on side with us.
[4395.76s -> 4396.88s]  I cleared, I cleared, I cleared.
[4396.88s -> 4398.00s]  All right, good, good, good.
[4398.00s -> 4398.96s]  Coming left, left side.
[4399.60s -> 4401.52s]  Oh, no, I'm stunned, I'm stunned.
[4401.52s -> 4402.35s]  It's all right.
[4402.35s -> 4403.07s]  We got points still.
[4403.71s -> 4405.23s]  They're just mad stunning that bitch right now.
[4405.23s -> 4406.19s]  We just get off for a second.
[4407.44s -> 4407.94s]  Got one.
[4409.10s -> 4410.38s]  Got another, switching guns.
[4410.38s -> 4410.88s]  Fuck me.
[4412.91s -> 4413.41s]  I'm nading.
[4414.41s -> 4419.02s]  Back on point, baby.
[4419.02s -> 4419.66s]  In that house.
[4419.66s -> 4423.37s]  Oh, I just got murdered.
[4423.37s -> 4424.65s]  We're still in the lead.
[4424.65s -> 4427.21s]  We're good.
[4427.21s -> 4427.69s]  Pushing out.
[4427.69s -> 4430.35s]  All right, we need, we need to, yeah.

[4432.83s -> 4434.99s]  Oh, it's Anthony who's holding that door.
[4437.44s -> 4438.48s]  I'm rocking with you, Sakuna.
[4438.48s -> 4440.00s]  Let's do what we did last time on the streets.
[4440.00s -> 4442.62s]  Anthony's holding right if we're pushing towards it.
[4442.62s -> 4443.90s]  Yeah, yeah, let's go left then.
[4443.90s -> 4448.19s]  Blasted, Mike.
[4448.19s -> 4449.15s]  Wow, holy shit.
[4449.87s -> 4452.67s]  He's holding this door outside of the market.
[4452.67s -> 4453.39s]  Electronic shop.
[4457.47s -> 4459.15s]  Oh, got a hit with that stun.
[4459.15s -> 4460.19s]  Got a hit with that stun.
[4461.39s -> 4464.91s]  Oh, oh, oh, they're very, they're very concussed.
[4464.91s -> 4467.20s]  Nice, nice.

[4491.34s -> 4499.15s]  Oh, bro, where are my bullets going?
[4499.15s -> 4499.63s]  Where?
[4499.63s -> 4502.03s]  Oh, why did my gun switch?
[4502.03s -> 4506.62s]  I got, I got blowing on site.
[4506.62s -> 4508.48s]  Okay.
[4508.48s -> 4511.12s]  Oh, God, there's somebody holding it back with a knife.
[4511.92s -> 4512.32s]  All right.
[4514.46s -> 4516.60s]  One got stun, one got nade.
[4516.60s -> 4520.41s]  Swinging, reloading.
[4520.41s -> 4520.81s]  What?
[4520.81s -> 4522.41s]  Reloading, and then I'm going to, I'm pushing into site after this.

[4544.09s -> 4546.68s]  God!
[4546.68s -> 4547.56s]  Watch out behind us.
[4549.76s -> 4552.24s]  I'm never inviting another fucking OTB member to this.
[4552.24s -> 4554.40s]  So the fucking, this is mad shit ever again.
[4554.40s -> 4556.00s]  Oh, my God.
[4556.00s -> 4558.16s]  Going through the fucking content knives, dude.
[4558.16s -> 4558.72s]  Fuck off.
[4561.20s -> 4561.92s]  I don't care.
[4561.92s -> 4562.80s]  I don't give a fuck.
[4567.16s -> 4568.60s]  I couldn't even see where I was.
[4568.60s -> 4569.80s]  All the way in the back.
[4569.80s -> 4571.00s]  I got sim, I got sim.
[4571.00s -> 4571.96s]  It's fucking free.
[4574.86s -> 4575.42s]  Go in.

[4576.22s -> 4577.34s]  Go in, you dumb bitch.
[4577.90s -> 4579.26s]  You fat ass character model.
[4579.26s -> 4580.14s]  Oh, my God.
[4582.70s -> 4584.62s]  Why can I go in there?
[4584.62s -> 4585.66s]  It should be mid.
[4585.66s -> 4586.78s]  Stop feeding.
[4586.78s -> 4587.50s]  I can't help it.
[4587.50s -> 4589.82s]  You just ran out, jumped, sprayed in.
[4591.95s -> 4592.91s]  Come on.
[4593.79s -> 4598.75s]  So remember, this mode, it has no time limit.
[4598.75s -> 4599.79s]  So we can still come back.
[4602.49s -> 4603.13s]  Oh, fuck.
[4603.13s -> 4603.85s]  Okay, next point.

[4608.33s -> 4611.69s]  I've got metal gear solid NPC vision apparently in this game.
[4611.69s -> 4613.29s]  Oh, sim is going in the middle right now.
[4613.93s -> 4615.13s]  I'm holding right.
[4615.13s -> 4615.53s]  Oh, God.
[4615.53s -> 4616.17s]  He's very nice.
[4616.17s -> 4616.67s]  Nice.
[4617.29s -> 4618.25s]  Don't somebody's next to me.
[4618.25s -> 4618.75s]  Oh, God.
[4619.55s -> 4620.43s]  All right, I got you with defense.
[4620.43s -> 4620.99s]  I got you with defense.
[4620.99s -> 4621.63s]  I got you with defense.
[4621.63s -> 4622.43s]  Oh, God, I'm so stunned.
[4622.43s -> 4623.07s]  I'm so stunned.
[4623.07s -> 4624.83s]  No, no, no, I got you, I got you, I got you.
[4624.83s -> 4625.55s]  I got you, baby.
[4625.55s -> 4626.59s]  He's on the other side, other side.
[4628.51s -> 4629.39s]  What the fuck?
[4630.19s -> 4630.75s]  He's on top.
[4631.39s -> 4632.03s]  We fucking got this.
[4632.03s -> 4632.75s]  Another one, another one.
[4632.75s -> 4633.15s]  Oh, my God.
[4633.15s -> 4634.35s]  There's another one prone.
[4634.35s -> 4635.26s]  It's okay.
[4635.26s -> 4635.74s]  We got this.
[4635.74s -> 4636.70s]  Our point, our point.
[4637.87s -> 4638.37s]  Yay.
[4641.07s -> 4641.57s]  Oops.
[4647.81s -> 4649.49s]  Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[4649.49s -> 4649.99s]  Nice.
[4650.85s -> 4651.65s]  All right, all right.
[4651.65s -> 4652.93s]  Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it.
[4652.93s -> 4653.25s]  Next one.
[4653.25s -> 4653.73s]  Yeah.
[4653.73s -> 4654.61s]  Yeah, next one comes up.
[4654.61s -> 4655.97s]  We got to start defending for next one.
[4656.45s -> 4659.42s]  I'm going for the next one right now, I think.
[4660.06s -> 4661.90s]  Yeah, they're already rotating toward it.
[4661.90s -> 4663.02s]  Oh, my gosh.
[4663.02s -> 4663.82s]  You sent me to the back, right?
[4663.82s -> 4664.30s]  You sent me to the back.
[4664.30s -> 4664.62s]  I got it.
[4664.62s -> 4664.94s]  I got it.
[4664.94s -> 4667.73s]  Yeah, I got it.
[4668.69s -> 4669.57s]  Oh, fuck.
[4670.53s -> 4671.41s]  They don't have stairs yet.
[4671.41s -> 4672.37s]  They don't have stairs yet.
[4673.01s -> 4675.41s]  Oh, no, there's somebody behind me.
[4675.41s -> 4675.91s]  Running.
[4678.53s -> 4679.17s]  I'm busting through.
[4679.17s -> 4680.29s]  I'm busting through.
[4680.29s -> 4683.65s]  No, oh, dude.
[4683.65s -> 4686.29s]  Oh, my God.
[4686.29s -> 4688.45s]  I feel like it's so much closer than it is.
[4689.41s -> 4691.46s]  I just died so fast.
[4691.46s -> 4692.42s]  It felt like it was pretty close.
[4692.42s -> 4693.94s]  It was the jammed support backpack of Symphony, man.
[4694.58s -> 4695.70s]  Nah, but like.
[4695.70s -> 4696.50s]  No, it is.
[4696.50s -> 4699.54s]  Bro, brother, look at the kills.
[4700.66s -> 4701.86s]  Yeah, but I'm right there.
[4701.86s -> 4702.50s]  I'm toe to toe.
[4703.71s -> 4705.47s]  We got more kills than them total, I think, bro.
[4707.09s -> 4708.93s]  They're fucking nice on objective play right now.
[4709.49s -> 4709.89s]  Legit.
[4709.89s -> 4711.73s]  I think we're actually, we have more kills total.
[4712.37s -> 4713.57s]  Oh, yeah, you're right, you're right.
[4716.08s -> 4717.65s]  Next one, SMD.
[4717.65s -> 4718.77s]  It was a good round.
[4718.77s -> 4720.37s]  That's what I'm saying.
[4720.37s -> 4721.41s]  We're out fragging them.
[4721.41s -> 4722.21s]  It's Symphony.
[4723.38s -> 4724.18s]  Hard carry.
[4725.49s -> 4726.91s]  Unbelievable.
[4726.91s -> 4729.79s]  I'm going to have Brooke like unplug the internet real quick.
[4731.39s -> 4736.35s]  Have Symphony route through the VPN to like around like a circle around the globe
[4736.35s -> 4739.74s]  and then hit back to here.
[4739.74s -> 4741.10s]  Give Symphony like 400 ping.
[4741.10s -> 4746.98s]  One, two, one, two, four, five, one, two, three, four.
[4746.98s -> 4748.18s]  So much change in their class.
[4748.18s -> 4749.06s]  I'm going to go yell at them.
[4749.06s -> 4750.74s]  Feel free to come with me and talk shit.
[4750.74s -> 4759.42s]  What's next, anyway?
[4759.42s -> 4760.80s]  Hold on.
[4760.80s -> 4761.68s]  What's up?
[4761.68s -> 4763.12s]  I'm just adjusting.
[4763.12s -> 4763.60s]  What's up?
[4764.24s -> 4765.44s]  I'm just adjusting stuff.
[4766.16s -> 4767.44s]  Chats, chats, metagaming for me.
[4767.44s -> 4768.00s]  Did you call me?
[4768.80s -> 4769.68s]  Yeah, I called you.
[4769.68s -> 4770.72s]  What the fuck?
[4770.72s -> 4771.20s]  Hi, coach.
[4771.20s -> 4772.72s]  How's it going?
[4772.72s -> 4773.84s]  It's going awful.
[4773.84s -> 4774.56s]  I don't like you.
[4775.12s -> 4775.44s]  What's up?
[4775.44s -> 4776.16s]  It's going great.
[4776.16s -> 4777.04s]  Master Yoshi.
[4777.04s -> 4778.32s]  I do not like you.
[4778.32s -> 4779.28s]  What did I do?
[4780.40s -> 4781.12s]  What did I do?
[4781.76s -> 4782.40s]  What the fuck?
[4782.40s -> 4785.92s]  You fucking, you got your little knife hiding in a little fucking corner.
[4786.72s -> 4788.80s]  Dad, you don't like my jet belt?
[4788.80s -> 4789.52s]  He's a gentleman.
[4789.52s -> 4790.24s]  What do you feel strong?
[4790.24s -> 4792.88s]  Are you low playing as jet and call of duty?
[4792.88s -> 4794.24s]  What the fuck?
[4794.24s -> 4797.12s]  And then I'm double smoking site and then I flash it and then I go in.
[4800.70s -> 4802.48s]  I'm gonna blow up my house.
[4802.48s -> 4803.60s]  I can't escape the Valor, man.
[4803.60s -> 4804.40s]  I have an itch.
[4804.40s -> 4805.44s]  Okay, it's not my fault.
[4805.44s -> 4806.24s]  What the fuck?
[4808.14s -> 4808.78s]  It's a problem.
[4808.78s -> 4809.10s]  I know.
[4809.10s -> 4813.01s]  I'm aware of it.
[4813.01s -> 4813.33s]  Jet.
[4814.86s -> 4815.74s]  Hey, Sim.
[4815.74s -> 4816.46s]  What's up, buddy?
[4817.18s -> 4817.82s]  Yeah, you like that?
[4817.82s -> 4819.26s]  You like that map a little bit more?
[4819.26s -> 4821.34s]  Yeah, I started calling out, bro.
[4821.34s -> 4822.38s]  You should have heard my comms.
[4822.38s -> 4823.10s]  Oh, crap.
[4823.10s -> 4824.14s]  No shot, man.
[4824.78s -> 4827.90s]  It looks like I so badly want to participate in like the trash talk,
[4827.90s -> 4829.82s]  but I just like don't know how.
[4829.82s -> 4834.53s]  And I just I just want to be heard on everybody else's stream.
[4834.53s -> 4835.65s]  You know what I mean?
[4835.65s -> 4836.85s]  Like, what the fuck?
[4836.85s -> 4837.97s]  It's me, Jerma talking by the way.
[4837.97s -> 4839.33s]  It's Jerma985 talking.
[4839.33s -> 4841.90s]  I just like so badly want to be on other people's streams.
[4841.90s -> 4842.86s]  That's like what I'm doing.
[4843.42s -> 4844.22s]  That's what that is.
[4845.73s -> 4849.54s]  I just like want to be heard on that stream.
[4849.54s -> 4850.02s]  All right.
[4850.02s -> 4851.46s]  I'm going to get 20 kills next game.
[4852.02s -> 4853.14s]  Just you watch.
[4853.14s -> 4853.78s]  Just you watch.
[4856.37s -> 4859.44s]  No, GG though.
[4859.44s -> 4863.42s]  GG indeed.
[4863.42s -> 4863.98s]  Next game.
[4865.76s -> 4873.38s]  Oh, I think we're going to do.
[4874.18s -> 4875.70s]  We're going to do SND next map.
[4877.42s -> 4878.46s]  That'll be interesting.
[4878.46s -> 4879.58s]  That'll be really interesting.
[4879.58s -> 4881.26s]  Yeah, I think SND will be a lot of fun.
[4881.26s -> 4884.70s]  Let's do this.
[4886.37s -> 4887.17s]  Fuck.
[4887.17s -> 4888.66s]  By the way.
[4888.66s -> 4890.02s]  I'm pressed after that last one.
[4890.02s -> 4890.90s]  I'm not even going to front.
[4890.90s -> 4891.86s]  For those who don't know.
[4894.82s -> 4895.78s]  For those that don't know.
[4895.78s -> 4897.70s]  Honestly, you guys had a good lead for a minute.
[4897.70s -> 4898.50s]  I was like, oh, fuck.
[4898.50s -> 4899.22s]  I'm the sus guy.
[4901.22s -> 4902.10s]  For those who don't know.
[4903.54s -> 4904.42s]  I'm the sus guy.
[4906.13s -> 4907.25s]  I'm fucking muted, guys.
[4907.25s -> 4908.69s]  Relax as a joke.
[4908.69s -> 4921.92s]  I didn't do that.
[4921.92s -> 4923.52s]  I've been muted almost the whole time.
[4923.52s -> 4924.16s]  Don't you get it?
[4927.14s -> 4928.02s]  I would never do that.
[4928.02s -> 4935.06s]  That's so stupid and embarrassing.
[4935.06s -> 4938.00s]  Why would I ever do that?
[4938.00s -> 4940.96s]  I honestly, I'm going to sound like a fucking weirdo.
[4940.96s -> 4942.88s]  I wouldn't do that for 10 grand.
[4942.88s -> 4945.89s]  I don't think so.
[4945.89s -> 4948.29s]  If it was like, hey, dude, I'll give you $10,000.
[4948.29s -> 4950.29s]  If you announced to all these streamers that,
[4950.29s -> 4952.37s]  hey, just in case you guys want to know.
[4952.37s -> 4953.33s]  I'm the sus guy.
[4953.33s -> 4954.93s]  And like, don't make it a joke.
[4954.93s -> 4956.37s]  I wouldn't do that for 10 grand.
[4956.37s -> 4957.49s]  I wouldn't do it.
[4957.49s -> 4959.39s]  Or I might.
[4959.39s -> 4960.43s]  All right, we're going to run it up.
[4965.14s -> 4967.06s]  Next one is SND, by the way.
[4967.06s -> 4974.78s]  God.
[4974.78s -> 4976.94s]  Can I change my my loadout really quick?
[4977.90s -> 4978.54s]  Hold up.
[4978.54s -> 4979.42s]  Do it for free.
[4980.22s -> 4982.72s]  I thought this was Michael Myers.
[4982.72s -> 4984.50s]  I thought that was Michael Myers.
[4984.50s -> 4986.10s]  I was like, what the fuck is that?
[4986.10s -> 4991.84s]  I don't know.
[4991.84s -> 4994.00s]  But the more that I think about it,
[4994.00s -> 4995.92s]  would I want to make all these other streamers think
[4995.92s -> 4999.30s]  that I was like this fucking nerd?
[4999.30s -> 5001.22s]  Like trying to be wicked funny.
[5001.22s -> 5002.42s]  Like, shut up.
[5002.42s -> 5003.06s]  Shut up, dude.
[5003.06s -> 5004.02s]  Get out of the lobby.
[5004.02s -> 5005.46s]  Fucking get out of here.
[5005.46s -> 5006.42s]  I think I'm ready.
[5006.42s -> 5019.79s]  Yeah, I think I'm good to go.
[5020.51s -> 5022.83s]  You guys want to want to make it crazy.
[5022.83s -> 5024.11s]  So this is search and destroyer?
[5024.11s -> 5026.26s]  Yes.
[5026.82s -> 5027.38s]  Yes.
[5027.38s -> 5030.30s]  And then so we're just doing something with the class
[5030.30s -> 5033.09s]  and then we're running it.
[5033.09s -> 5033.65s]  I'm done.
[5033.65s -> 5034.21s]  I'm ready.
[5034.21s -> 5036.91s]  Oh, I'm going to use the weapon I had before.
[5036.91s -> 5038.11s]  I feel like I was better with it.
[5038.11s -> 5039.89s]  It's going to be same.
[5039.89s -> 5041.42s]  Same.
[5041.42s -> 5042.38s]  I want to be honest.
[5042.38s -> 5045.90s]  I switched to the same gun that Symphony uses
[5045.90s -> 5048.78s]  in hopes of being almost as good as he is.
[5050.86s -> 5052.70s]  Oh, I hope it works really good.
[5052.70s -> 5053.42s]  I'm using it.
[5053.42s -> 5053.74s]  Yeah.
[5053.74s -> 5057.33s]  Yeah, that's what it seems like.
[5057.33s -> 5059.97s]  Guys, what SND maps are new Plaza or Raid?
[5061.28s -> 5061.78s]  Raid.
[5065.62s -> 5066.10s]  I don't know.
[5066.66s -> 5068.98s]  I was just good, but it's just really it's just really big.
[5068.98s -> 5069.46s]  Raids.
[5069.46s -> 5070.10s]  Raids a throwback.
[5070.10s -> 5070.74s]  Raids the throwback.
[5070.74s -> 5071.62s]  Raid is a throwback.
[5071.62s -> 5071.94s]  Let's see.
[5071.94s -> 5072.66s]  Raid SND.
[5074.24s -> 5074.56s]  All right.
[5074.56s -> 5076.08s]  Stuns got me moving in slow motion.
[5080.96s -> 5083.74s]  Got him.
[5083.74s -> 5085.10s]  I feel like we're going to win this one.
[5087.28s -> 5088.96s]  Yeah, surely we'll win this.
[5088.96s -> 5089.46s]  Surely.
[5092.00s -> 5095.18s]  For all I think we're not putting up a bad fight.
[5095.18s -> 5095.90s]  No, I don't think so.
[5095.90s -> 5097.34s]  Yeah, we can't win it.
[5097.34s -> 5098.38s]  This game is fun.
[5098.46s -> 5099.02s]  It really is.
[5100.22s -> 5102.38s]  It's just so hectic and fasted.
[5103.42s -> 5108.48s]  Oh, here we go.
[5108.48s -> 5113.28s]  So is this a big map like long range or short range?
[5113.28s -> 5113.84s]  Long range.
[5115.94s -> 5124.74s]  Now that I copied Symphony's gun, surely I'll be half as good.
[5124.74s -> 5126.66s]  So is this it?
[5126.66s -> 5127.38s]  They're going to fix it.
[5127.38s -> 5127.86s]  Oh, okay.
[5127.86s -> 5128.66s]  Yeah, they're going to fix it.
[5128.66s -> 5128.82s]  Yeah.
[5128.82s -> 5129.38s]  Am I bugged?
[5130.64s -> 5131.84s]  My scope doesn't work.
[5131.84s -> 5135.44s]  Oh, yeah, because everyone's lagged.
[5135.44s -> 5137.60s]  Like definitely having some kind of sites.
[5154.03s -> 5162.69s]  Say la la into the lobby.
[5162.69s -> 5166.69s]  I wouldn't do that 10 grand.
[5166.69s -> 5179.60s]  No, is it up yet or is just me?
[5181.07s -> 5181.87s]  No, it's not up yet.
[5181.87s -> 5183.15s]  They're restarting the server, I think.
[5191.62s -> 5197.07s]  So is this so with this, this is going to be search and destroy, right?
[5197.07s -> 5197.39s]  Yeah.
[5197.39s -> 5198.43s]  So when you're dead, you're out.
[5198.43s -> 5200.30s]  So we've got to play careful.
[5200.30s -> 5200.86s]  Yep.
[5200.86s -> 5202.78s]  Make sure you play really, really careful.
[5202.78s -> 5203.42s]  Goku.
[5203.42s -> 5207.98s]  Is that a is that a Dragon Ball line?
[5207.98s -> 5208.54s]  Yep.
[5208.54s -> 5210.06s]  That's a Mr. That's Mr.
[5210.06s -> 5214.21s]  Safe Dragon Ball.
[5214.21s -> 5215.25s]  Wait, what?
[5215.41s -> 5215.89s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[5215.89s -> 5216.13s]  Really?
[5216.13s -> 5217.09s]  Never watch Dragon Ball.
[5217.09s -> 5217.41s]  You're lying.
[5217.41s -> 5218.37s]  You're lying.
[5218.37s -> 5219.70s]  Not lying.
[5219.70s -> 5220.26s]  Is that bad?
[5220.82s -> 5222.02s]  I mean, it's bad.
[5222.02s -> 5223.81s]  How old are you?
[5223.81s -> 5224.53s]  Oh, 23.
[5226.85s -> 5227.97s]  23.
[5227.97s -> 5228.98s]  Yep.
[5228.98s -> 5229.86s]  I Dragon Ball.
[5229.86s -> 5232.82s]  I mean, like Dragon Ball Dragon Ball or any.
[5232.82s -> 5234.02s]  My parents should have had me earlier.
[5234.02s -> 5234.98s]  28, bro.
[5234.98s -> 5235.62s]  Why the fuck that?
[5237.38s -> 5240.05s]  What the bro?
[5240.61s -> 5241.49s]  What the?
[5241.49s -> 5242.85s]  That's 28.
[5242.85s -> 5244.53s]  Bro, I thought you were 28.
[5244.53s -> 5245.33s]  Come on, man.
[5245.97s -> 5247.25s]  Oh, shit.
[5248.05s -> 5249.25s]  I look like a boomer.
[5251.42s -> 5252.38s]  I thought you were 28.
[5259.66s -> 5260.70s]  How old do you think I am?
[5260.70s -> 5262.24s]  Let me take a guess.
[5262.24s -> 5262.72s]  28.
[5262.72s -> 5263.68s]  25.
[5263.68s -> 5268.05s]  Who's closer?
[5268.05s -> 5271.15s]  You are both very far away.
[5271.15s -> 5272.19s]  No way.
[5272.19s -> 5273.15s]  Incredibly far away.
[5273.15s -> 5273.55s]  18?
[5273.55s -> 5274.19s]  Incredibly.
[5274.19s -> 5274.75s]  No way.
[5274.75s -> 5275.23s]  18?
[5275.23s -> 5276.62s]  Way higher.
[5276.62s -> 5277.12s]  Oh.
[5277.90s -> 5279.04s]  38.
[5279.04s -> 5280.88s]  A little bit lower.
[5280.88s -> 5282.75s]  35.
[5282.75s -> 5283.63s]  A little bit higher.
[5283.63s -> 5285.20s]  36.
[5285.20s -> 5285.68s]  Yep.
[5285.68s -> 5286.56s]  That's it.
[5286.56s -> 5286.88s]  Wow.
[5286.88s -> 5288.08s]  I would not have guessed.
[5288.96s -> 5291.12s]  Well, I mean, yeah, I didn't guess.
[5292.00s -> 5293.44s]  Don't tell anybody that, though.
[5293.44s -> 5294.48s]  I don't know if you guys are streaming.
[5294.48s -> 5295.12s]  Hopefully, you're muted.
[5296.00s -> 5296.48s]  I keep that.
[5296.48s -> 5297.36s]  I don't know.
[5298.16s -> 5300.03s]  I say I'm 32.
[5300.03s -> 5302.59s]  I've been 32 for the last five years.
[5302.59s -> 5304.66s]  I feel like after a certain age,
[5304.66s -> 5308.62s]  it feels all about the same.
[5308.62s -> 5309.74s]  Eating the same oatmeal.
[5309.74s -> 5310.22s]  Yeah.
[5310.22s -> 5313.02s]  After 30, it's just like whatever.
[5313.02s -> 5316.08s]  I always thought when I was like 25, 28,
[5316.08s -> 5318.08s]  I was like, oh, man, I don't want to turn 30.
[5318.08s -> 5318.80s]  No, fuck.
[5318.80s -> 5320.00s]  I'm going to be so old.
[5320.00s -> 5320.88s]  Anyway, I dreaded it.
[5320.88s -> 5325.20s]  Like, you know, did you used to be a cod YouTuber?
[5325.20s -> 5325.76s]  No.
[5325.76s -> 5326.26s]  Why?
[5326.40s -> 5328.16s]  You used to be a League of Legends YouTuber.
[5328.16s -> 5329.04s]  Chat's lying.
[5329.04s -> 5330.24s]  Chat's just camping.
[5330.24s -> 5332.58s]  I'm 29, bro.
[5332.58s -> 5333.38s]  Yeah, don't worry.
[5333.38s -> 5334.50s]  After 30 doesn't matter.
[5334.50s -> 5339.42s]  I used to be a League of Legends YouTuber back in the day.
[5339.42s -> 5340.14s]  Solid duty.
[5340.14s -> 5342.59s]  I mean, that's pretty different from cod.
[5342.59s -> 5343.15s]  Yeah.
[5343.15s -> 5349.17s]  I mean, I played it before, but I wasn't like a cod YouTuber.
[5349.17s -> 5350.05s]  That's for sure.
[5350.05s -> 5352.46s]  All right.
[5352.46s -> 5353.02s]  We're good to go.
[5353.74s -> 5354.54s]  Am I in the game?
[5356.69s -> 5357.33s]  Am I?
[5357.33s -> 5357.89s]  Why are you?
[5358.69s -> 5359.81s]  I was just spectating for some reason.
[5359.81s -> 5367.10s]  I don't know why.
[5367.10s -> 5368.22s]  SNG, baby.
[5368.86s -> 5372.66s]  Remember, the secondhand embarrassment is killing us.
[5372.66s -> 5374.05s]  Stop.
[5374.05s -> 5376.05s]  I'm muted nine out of 10 times.
[5376.05s -> 5377.25s]  We get video once.
[5377.25s -> 5378.45s]  We're just having a good time.
[5378.45s -> 5378.93s]  Relax.
[5378.93s -> 5380.21s]  I've played before, but.
[5380.21s -> 5381.73s]  Secondhand embarrassment.
[5381.73s -> 5384.93s]  Hey, well, then good, because my tweet, that's what you're here for.
[5386.27s -> 5390.82s]  Yeah, I mean, I've played the game before, and that's like, and like, not even a lot.
[5390.82s -> 5391.86s]  Like, maybe once.
[5391.86s -> 5396.22s]  That's about as far as it goes.
[5396.22s -> 5397.18s]  You're clapping them, though.
[5397.18s -> 5399.82s]  You guys think I'm saying half of this stuff into the public lobby here?
[5399.82s -> 5403.34s]  I think anyone who would call me a cod YouTuber is
[5403.34s -> 5405.02s]  got to be horribly confused.
[5405.02s -> 5406.29s]  Gotcha.
[5406.29s -> 5406.69s]  All right.
[5406.69s -> 5409.09s]  Maybe we should split up where we're where we defend.
[5409.09s -> 5419.10s]  I'm thinking we would go like to to to a to be Dean and Saikuno a a a.
[5419.10s -> 5419.42s]  All right.
[5419.42s -> 5419.82s]  Alien.
[5419.82s -> 5420.46s]  Alias.
[5421.50s -> 5421.90s]  Sounds good.
[5422.46s -> 5423.18s]  Rotate.
[5423.18s -> 5424.54s]  Wait, Valorant.
[5424.54s -> 5425.50s]  Valorant.
[5425.50s -> 5427.18s]  Oh, he's your juice then, right?
[5427.18s -> 5427.98s]  I think that's good for.
[5427.98s -> 5431.18s]  I hope I hope I hope.
[5431.18s -> 5431.90s]  I'm pretty sure that's.
[5431.90s -> 5434.22s]  Yeah, that's like long, long sites and shit.
[5434.22s -> 5439.28s]  Let's hold the bombs down and let's fucking let's clap these kids.
[5439.28s -> 5441.66s]  Yeah, I'm not afraid.
[5441.66s -> 5446.22s]  I'm not afraid to take a stance.
[5446.22s -> 5459.55s]  Oh, oh, we have no one on B.
[5459.55s -> 5461.23s]  We're heading over there.
[5461.23s -> 5464.29s]  It's a first floor.
[5464.29s -> 5465.97s]  They're on B B planning.
[5465.97s -> 5466.21s]  Yeah.
[5466.21s -> 5467.81s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[5467.81s -> 5469.70s]  Thank God they're on B.
[5469.70s -> 5470.58s]  Oh, I just didn't get it.
[5471.14s -> 5475.10s]  I've never played this game mode.
[5475.10s -> 5477.02s]  I just got shot from the second floor.
[5477.02s -> 5478.14s]  Didn't even see him.
[5478.14s -> 5483.95s]  I've literally never played search and destroy ever.
[5483.95s -> 5486.45s]  Fuck one inside of a window B.
[5486.45s -> 5487.41s]  I'll just do.
[5489.07s -> 5489.63s]  Yeah, I'm dead.
[5490.67s -> 5492.19s]  Turning corner with a grenade.
[5497.63s -> 5498.35s]  My eyes closed.
[5498.35s -> 5500.27s]  Besides, I think we're attacked now.
[5500.27s -> 5502.05s]  I'm not going to lie.
[5502.05s -> 5506.53s]  They're literally playing this like Valorant and not like S&D.
[5507.17s -> 5509.25s]  I don't think I've ever had it.
[5509.25s -> 5514.78s]  I don't think I've ever played an S&D thing where people just instantly went and planted.
[5515.82s -> 5517.18s]  We gave them B site, though.
[5517.18s -> 5518.90s]  We had no one there.
[5518.90s -> 5521.66s]  Just thinking bomb.
[5521.66s -> 5522.30s]  All right.
[5522.30s -> 5524.38s]  I'm thinking I'm thinking we try to like work A here.
[5524.86s -> 5527.66s]  Do I have to be holding this?
[5527.66s -> 5529.02s]  They're going to be holding this hard.
[5529.02s -> 5530.54s]  Just rush in guys.
[5530.54s -> 5536.08s]  Just full speed blast kind of thing.
[5536.08s -> 5536.88s]  One's on the rocks.
[5537.76s -> 5541.10s]  I have mid control.
[5542.94s -> 5543.42s]  They're on A.
[5546.51s -> 5557.25s]  Hold up.
[5557.25s -> 5558.93s]  They gave me a lot of space here.
[5558.93s -> 5560.10s]  Could we get bombed down?
[5560.74s -> 5561.86s]  Yeah, putting it down.
[5561.86s -> 5562.74s]  Doesn't matter where.
[5562.74s -> 5563.62s]  Basketball court.
[5563.62s -> 5563.94s]  Nope.
[5563.94s -> 5564.66s]  Nope.
[5564.66s -> 5569.04s]  All right, it's done.
[5570.48s -> 5571.12s]  Oh, my God.
[5571.12s -> 5571.60s]  He knifed.
[5573.68s -> 5575.23s]  I got one.
[5575.23s -> 5582.30s]  They're playing up.
[5582.30s -> 5583.02s]  How many do they got left?
[5583.02s -> 5583.82s]  One.
[5583.82s -> 5584.46s]  Nice.
[5584.46s -> 5585.10s]  One's prone.
[5585.10s -> 5585.66s]  That's John.
[5585.66s -> 5586.62s]  He's only got a knife.
[5586.62s -> 5587.50s]  He's only got a knife.
[5589.34s -> 5589.50s]  Where?
[5589.50s -> 5589.66s]  Where?
[5589.66s -> 5590.38s]  Where?
[5590.38s -> 5592.14s]  He's he's he's proning next to the I don't know.
[5592.14s -> 5593.50s]  Is he happy with whatever?
[5593.50s -> 5594.30s]  He fucking did it.
[5594.30s -> 5595.10s]  I died with a knife.
[5596.46s -> 5596.94s]  He shot.
[5597.74s -> 5599.42s]  What the fuck happened?
[5599.42s -> 5601.26s]  He hit you with the ballistic knife.
[5602.62s -> 5602.94s]  Why?
[5606.21s -> 5606.61s]  Let's go.
[5606.61s -> 5607.41s]  Yes, we got it.
[5607.41s -> 5609.57s]  Oh, my God.
[5609.57s -> 5610.69s]  Oh, God.
[5610.69s -> 5617.79s]  Here's this fucking ballistic knife.
[5617.79s -> 5618.83s]  Jet main, dude.
[5618.91s -> 5620.75s]  He's actually playing like he's jet.
[5620.75s -> 5621.47s]  It's so good.
[5622.51s -> 5624.10s]  It's so good.
[5624.10s -> 5630.48s]  He peeked around the corner and I just went like it's dead.
[5630.48s -> 5631.04s]  All right.
[5631.04s -> 5634.18s]  Let's make sure.
[5634.18s -> 5637.09s]  Let's have some B defense at the start here.
[5637.09s -> 5637.81s]  Nice.
[5637.81s -> 5639.65s]  I'm going to hold A like you said earlier.
[5639.65s -> 5640.21s]  I like this.
[5640.21s -> 5640.45s]  Yeah.
[5640.45s -> 5640.61s]  Yeah.
[5640.61s -> 5641.09s]  I'm on A.
[5641.09s -> 5641.65s]  I'm on A.
[5644.80s -> 5646.32s]  I think they're pushing B hard.
[5646.32s -> 5646.88s]  Yeah.
[5646.88s -> 5647.68s]  I'm in the window.
[5651.50s -> 5652.14s]  That's them.
[5652.14s -> 5653.02s]  They just leave mid open.
[5653.02s -> 5653.42s]  That's them.
[5653.42s -> 5654.72s]  That's them.
[5654.72s -> 5655.60s]  I have a hot flank.
[5656.96s -> 5661.52s]  Yeah, I'm working.
[5665.55s -> 5666.11s]  I muted.
[5666.51s -> 5667.39s]  What am I doing?
[5667.39s -> 5668.19s]  The grenade.
[5670.19s -> 5672.99s]  Let me run around the corner with a fucking.
[5672.99s -> 5675.07s]  It's a FPS video game.
[5675.07s -> 5675.87s]  Single player.
[5676.43s -> 5677.63s]  I'm the enemy.
[5677.63s -> 5678.59s]  Moving up.
[5678.59s -> 5679.87s]  That's what they do.
[5679.87s -> 5683.23s]  They come around the corner and they fucking lob it like a softball.
[5683.23s -> 5683.55s]  Let's go.
[5683.55s -> 5684.11s]  We got it, baby.
[5684.11s -> 5684.91s]  Let's go, baby.
[5687.01s -> 5687.49s]  Nice job.
[5687.49s -> 5688.59s]  Let's go.
[5688.59s -> 5690.18s]  One up.
[5690.18s -> 5691.22s]  We're S&D'ers.
[5691.78s -> 5692.42s]  Look at this shit.
[5695.60s -> 5696.56s]  Oh, man.
[5696.56s -> 5699.04s]  I'm not going to lie to that initial burst right there.
[5700.08s -> 5702.16s]  Yeah, we're not talking about that, but you know.
[5702.16s -> 5704.08s]  That shit was clean, my boy.
[5705.04s -> 5706.16s]  Thank you, my boy.
[5706.16s -> 5707.20s]  Come on, let's get two up.
[5707.20s -> 5707.76s]  All right, let's go.
[5707.76s -> 5708.00s]  Let's go.
[5708.00s -> 5708.48s]  What do I got?
[5708.48s -> 5708.96s]  Zero kills.
[5709.60s -> 5711.20s]  They leave mid dead open, bro.
[5711.20s -> 5712.32s]  It's literally a glitch.
[5712.32s -> 5712.96s]  Everyone mid.
[5712.96s -> 5714.08s]  Everyone made it.
[5714.08s -> 5714.90s]  Wait, no, no, no.
[5715.94s -> 5716.90s]  Okay, fuck it.
[5716.90s -> 5717.70s]  We got it.
[5717.70s -> 5719.78s]  Yeah, this is where we're going to be.
[5719.78s -> 5720.74s]  Oh, here's mid this time.
[5720.74s -> 5721.22s]  Good job.
[5721.22s -> 5722.38s]  Let's go B.
[5722.38s -> 5723.42s]  Yep, yep, yep.
[5723.42s -> 5724.54s]  Window, window.
[5724.54s -> 5726.46s]  I'm watching it rotate.
[5726.46s -> 5728.14s]  I like regenerate or something, right?
[5728.14s -> 5729.90s]  I mean, I think.
[5729.90s -> 5733.31s]  I'm scared.
[5733.31s -> 5734.51s]  Yeah, you're regenerating, I think.
[5734.51s -> 5735.31s]  That's okay.
[5735.31s -> 5735.63s]  All right.
[5735.63s -> 5736.83s]  I think we go bomb A.
[5736.83s -> 5737.31s]  Go bomb A.
[5737.31s -> 5738.51s]  Go bomb A now.
[5738.51s -> 5739.07s]  Oh, God.
[5739.07s -> 5740.51s]  I'm dying, man.
[5740.51s -> 5741.71s]  I'm dying.
[5741.71s -> 5743.55s]  I just don't know where anybody could be.
[5745.25s -> 5748.77s]  A game like this, you need to know where people can come from.
[5748.77s -> 5751.97s]  And I just put a fucking bat on the ground.
[5751.97s -> 5754.77s]  Put it on my head like this and just went in a circle.
[5754.77s -> 5756.86s]  Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.
[5756.86s -> 5757.50s]  Sick.
[5757.50s -> 5758.46s]  All right, where is he?
[5758.46s -> 5759.26s]  Where's the bad guy?
[5759.26s -> 5760.14s]  I don't see the A player.
[5761.50s -> 5762.30s]  We step outside.
[5763.42s -> 5764.54s]  They have one left, just sim.
[5766.56s -> 5767.68s]  Basketball court, basketball court.
[5767.68s -> 5768.32s]  Okay.
[5768.32s -> 5769.28s]  Yeah, let's go.
[5769.28s -> 5769.68s]  I'm sorry.
[5769.68s -> 5773.04s]  I'm an idiot.
[5773.04s -> 5773.44s]  Okay.
[5776.66s -> 5779.28s]  Oh, it was the basketball court.
[5779.28s -> 5781.04s]  Sakuno taking out symphony.
[5781.04s -> 5781.84s]  Oh, there it is.
[5781.84s -> 5783.36s]  The 1v1 challenge.
[5783.36s -> 5783.84s]  There it is.
[5783.84s -> 5784.56s]  Just peeking him.
[5784.56s -> 5787.22s]  That's great.
[5787.22s -> 5790.50s]  Isn't it so funny that they're not hearing me freak out every time?
[5790.50s -> 5791.78s]  All they're hearing is like, let's go.
[5791.78s -> 5792.74s]  Oh, sick.
[5792.74s -> 5801.90s]  Keep this shit hot.
[5801.90s -> 5805.23s]  All right, I hear a lot of stuns, eh?
[5805.23s -> 5806.03s]  Yeah, I'm looking.
[5806.03s -> 5810.29s]  I'm here to help you defend.
[5810.29s -> 5811.57s]  Let me know if they hear push up.
[5811.57s -> 5812.69s]  I'm going to watch mid still.
[5812.69s -> 5815.62s]  They're smoking, probably planting B.
[5815.62s -> 5815.94s]  That's all right.
[5815.94s -> 5816.66s]  It's a B rotate.
[5818.42s -> 5819.46s]  Behind, behind, behind.
[5819.46s -> 5829.62s]  In our spawn?
[5829.62s -> 5830.58s]  That was weird.
[5830.58s -> 5831.14s]  Fuck, man.
[5832.85s -> 5833.81s]  Is there a head there, man?
[5834.37s -> 5840.34s]  I just have no idea where people can come from.
[5840.34s -> 5841.38s]  Don't look at your teammate.
[5842.02s -> 5843.54s]  Guys, I don't know even where to walk.
[5844.90s -> 5854.78s]  Fuck.
[5854.78s -> 5855.42s]  Oh, shit.
[5855.42s -> 5856.14s]  He was the nicest guy.
[5856.14s -> 5856.46s]  It's close.
[5856.46s -> 5857.10s]  I didn't even see him.
[5857.10s -> 5857.98s]  Yeah, NT, NT.
[5864.64s -> 5865.68s]  It was three of them up.
[5868.42s -> 5871.25s]  It's okay.
[5871.25s -> 5871.81s]  We got this.
[5872.53s -> 5873.89s]  Somebody said, what the fuck?
[5873.89s -> 5874.85s]  Call of duty.
[5874.85s -> 5876.29s]  10 year old Andy.
[5876.29s -> 5878.67s]  I think it's a first to six.
[5879.23s -> 5880.98s]  Do you mean the game is 10 years old
[5880.98s -> 5882.42s]  or you mean calling me a 10 year old?
[5882.42s -> 5884.21s]  Because this game's fun.
[5884.21s -> 5886.62s]  PK again.
[5888.66s -> 5891.55s]  I got the bomb.
[5891.55s -> 5893.47s]  Oh, two fucking peeking mid.
[5896.59s -> 5897.39s]  One A window.
[5898.37s -> 5899.25s]  Symphony's pushing B.
[5901.10s -> 5902.38s]  He's probably going to try and go flank.
[5907.89s -> 5908.85s]  What the fuck?
[5908.85s -> 5909.89s]  I'm so confused right now.
[5909.89s -> 5912.40s]  That's me, that's me.
[5912.40s -> 5913.52s]  He's in the building.
[5913.52s -> 5914.64s]  He's in the building.
[5919.20s -> 5920.40s]  I can't play.
[5920.40s -> 5921.20s]  Why do you guys think
[5921.20s -> 5923.36s]  I've never played Counter-Strike?
[5923.36s -> 5924.08s]  Ever.
[5924.08s -> 5925.04s]  And Valorant?
[5925.04s -> 5925.92s]  I won't even open it.
[5927.76s -> 5928.96s]  I don't want to die.
[5928.96s -> 5929.28s]  I'm dead.
[5929.28s -> 5929.84s]  Oh, Dean.
[5931.14s -> 5932.42s]  I whipped so hard, bro.
[5932.42s -> 5933.38s]  I didn't come in there.
[5933.38s -> 5934.58s]  You know, I'm going to pretend
[5934.58s -> 5936.34s]  I totally didn't see that.
[5936.34s -> 5936.98s]  Nice job.
[5936.98s -> 5937.46s]  There it is.
[5937.46s -> 5939.38s]  Hey, hey, but the comms though.
[5939.38s -> 5940.42s]  But the comms though.
[5941.86s -> 5943.54s]  You know, sometimes,
[5943.54s -> 5944.98s]  you know, it'd be like that sometimes.
[5944.98s -> 5946.34s]  Everyone has one.
[5946.34s -> 5947.38s]  Everyone has one.
[5947.46s -> 5949.38s]  Yep, it happens to the best of them.
[5949.38s -> 5950.82s]  It really does.
[5950.82s -> 5951.62s]  It really does.
[5951.62s -> 5953.89s]  Only up from here now.
[5953.89s -> 5955.49s]  Wait, wait, I hit rock bottom?
[5959.42s -> 5960.54s]  I don't know, man.
[5960.54s -> 5967.39s]  Let me chow mid.
[5967.39s -> 5968.99s]  One's going A, one's going A.
[5968.99s -> 5970.19s]  I didn't see anybody.
[5970.19s -> 5971.95s]  They got like two mid control.
[5971.95s -> 5973.22s]  I'm going to go help out A.
[5973.22s -> 5974.18s]  You go B, K.
[5974.18s -> 5974.66s]  Thanks.
[5974.66s -> 5975.70s]  Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[5978.18s -> 5978.98s]  B, B, B.
[5978.98s -> 5982.50s]  He's down.
[5982.50s -> 5983.46s]  I don't see anybody at B yet.
[5983.46s -> 5984.42s]  A window, A window, A window.
[5984.42s -> 5986.91s]  Behind you, behind you.
[5986.91s -> 5987.39s]  B.
[5987.39s -> 5990.16s]  Oh, fuck.
[5990.16s -> 5991.36s]  Two mid, one mid.
[5991.36s -> 5993.34s]  One in that window.
[5993.34s -> 6002.40s]  I think Syke could be like in our spawn and shit.
[6002.40s -> 6003.52s]  I don't know.
[6003.52s -> 6004.16s]  They're on B?
[6004.16s -> 6004.56s]  B, okay.
[6004.56s -> 6004.88s]  Where?
[6008.93s -> 6009.57s]  He's tapped out.
[6009.57s -> 6010.61s]  I hit him a bunch of times on B.
[6010.61s -> 6011.73s]  There's one left.
[6011.73s -> 6013.33s]  Just mass, just John.
[6013.33s -> 6014.13s]  He's behind van.
[6014.13s -> 6015.49s]  Blue van, blue van.
[6015.49s -> 6017.42s]  Let's go, Jerma.
[6019.34s -> 6021.54s]  Let's go.
[6023.23s -> 6024.43s]  Good shit, K.
[6024.43s -> 6025.07s]  Here we go.
[6026.13s -> 6026.93s]  You got to do a 360.
[6026.93s -> 6027.33s]  Why are you doing it?
[6027.33s -> 6028.37s]  Because that's how the cool people do it.
[6028.93s -> 6029.33s]  Facts.
[6032.37s -> 6035.09s]  Not a controller player.
[6035.09s -> 6037.73s]  Somebody said, dude, you got famous on FPS games.
[6038.69s -> 6040.37s]  This is like 12 years ago.
[6040.37s -> 6043.49s]  People didn't even know how to tie their shoes in FPS games.
[6044.93s -> 6045.57s]  Yeah, of course.
[6046.13s -> 6047.17s]  I was fine back then.
[6047.17s -> 6047.73s]  I'm on the leaderboard.
[6056.85s -> 6058.75s]  Hacker who?
[6058.75s -> 6060.83s]  At least Jerma is out fragging Buddha.
[6060.83s -> 6062.11s]  So web that for us.
[6063.15s -> 6064.99s]  I did okay in that last round, I will say.
[6066.03s -> 6066.91s]  No one's peeking mid.
[6066.91s -> 6067.55s]  That's us.
[6067.55s -> 6068.35s]  Oh, I need to grab bomb.
[6068.35s -> 6069.47s]  I'm going to grab bomb for us.
[6069.47s -> 6071.01s]  Yo, let's end this shit right here.
[6071.01s -> 6071.65s]  Let's play safe.
[6071.65s -> 6072.21s]  Let's play tight.
[6072.21s -> 6072.69s]  Let's play right.
[6072.69s -> 6074.21s]  I'm going to go A with bomb.
[6074.21s -> 6076.53s]  Once I got him up a few times.
[6077.76s -> 6081.36s]  There's somebody on the right side.
[6081.36s -> 6086.37s]  I'm going to push out here.
[6086.37s -> 6086.77s]  Careful.
[6086.77s -> 6087.57s]  There's one.
[6087.57s -> 6089.09s]  He might have backed off.
[6089.09s -> 6090.46s]  B ball, B ball.
[6090.46s -> 6090.86s]  Yeah.
[6090.86s -> 6093.02s]  No, he's he's up in the corner out there.
[6093.02s -> 6094.56s]  At their window.
[6094.56s -> 6096.90s]  You'll see him to your right.
[6096.90s -> 6097.14s]  Yeah.
[6098.53s -> 6103.49s]  As my first YouTube videos, I had like boogers coming out of my nose.
[6106.18s -> 6107.62s]  You whacking son of a bitch.
[6107.62s -> 6109.22s]  It was a different world back then.
[6109.22s -> 6111.06s]  If we had some held there, you won that.
[6111.62s -> 6112.26s]  I was just like.
[6112.82s -> 6116.66s]  Hey, guys, I'm playing as the spy, I think.
[6116.66s -> 6117.38s]  I don't know.
[6117.38s -> 6117.94s]  Whatever.
[6117.94s -> 6119.30s]  I don't know.
[6119.30s -> 6122.94s]  All right, bro.
[6122.94s -> 6123.74s]  Let's get the all orbs.
[6131.22s -> 6133.14s]  Our defense is too mean.
[6133.14s -> 6134.66s]  I think we got it on defense.
[6144.11s -> 6144.91s]  Definitely 1A.
[6144.91s -> 6146.93s]  100% 1A.
[6146.93s -> 6147.33s]  Roger.
[6147.97s -> 6148.85s]  He's on site.
[6148.85s -> 6149.41s]  He's on site.
[6149.41s -> 6149.89s]  He's on site.
[6149.89s -> 6151.33s]  OK, OK, OK.
[6151.33s -> 6152.37s]  Falling back then.
[6152.37s -> 6153.09s]  I'm going to play with you.
[6158.26s -> 6159.38s]  Yeah, I died from window.
[6160.34s -> 6162.58s]  There's two bottom and then one up top.
[6162.58s -> 6162.90s]  Yep.
[6163.14s -> 6167.39s]  They're on the right side here.
[6167.39s -> 6171.20s]  Fuck.
[6171.20s -> 6172.80s]  Try to stun him out or some shit.
[6172.80s -> 6173.20s]  Oh, shit.
[6173.20s -> 6174.56s]  He's down, down, down, down, downstairs.
[6176.38s -> 6177.34s]  I thought he was still upstairs.
[6178.24s -> 6179.20s]  Are you able to get defuse?
[6179.92s -> 6180.88s]  No, I couldn't.
[6182.48s -> 6183.52s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6183.52s -> 6184.64s]  Oh, you got it.
[6185.84s -> 6186.72s]  You got it.
[6186.72s -> 6187.20s]  Nice.
[6187.20s -> 6187.68s]  Let's go.
[6188.32s -> 6189.44s]  Let's go, baby.
[6190.24s -> 6191.76s]  I yelled as you defuse.
[6191.76s -> 6192.48s]  I couldn't hear it.
[6200.93s -> 6203.41s]  Just in case there was a ghost was coming on the other side of him.
[6203.41s -> 6203.81s]  You know what I mean?
[6203.81s -> 6204.37s]  So true.
[6204.37s -> 6206.16s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6206.16s -> 6207.44s]  Got to make sure they're not breathing.
[6208.00s -> 6209.44s]  I'm adjusting for lag.
[6209.44s -> 6213.70s]  There you go.
[6213.70s -> 6214.50s]  You outfragged him.
[6214.50s -> 6215.38s]  Let's go.
[6215.38s -> 6217.14s]  As long as you're outfragging them.
[6217.14s -> 6218.02s]  That's all that matters.
[6220.48s -> 6220.72s]  Nice.
[6221.76s -> 6222.24s]  That was fun.
[6223.23s -> 6223.79s]  That was fun.
[6225.18s -> 6228.80s]  Apparently, she fell off the map.
[6228.80s -> 6229.36s]  Wait, what?
[6229.36s -> 6229.84s]  That match?
[6230.48s -> 6231.04s]  I don't know.
[6231.04s -> 6232.40s]  Apparently, she fell off the map.
[6242.35s -> 6244.27s]  Newtown domination is next.
[6244.27s -> 6245.15s]  Oh, man.
[6246.27s -> 6247.23s]  It's going to be insane.
[6249.70s -> 6250.66s]  You guys up for it?
[6252.18s -> 6252.98s]  Yeah, yeah.
[6252.98s -> 6253.46s]  Let's do it.
[6254.10s -> 6298.66s]  Let's get it.
[6298.66s -> 6299.22s]  All right, let's go.
[6299.22s -> 6300.18s]  Is this domination?
[6301.14s -> 6302.26s]  Yeah, this is domination.
[6302.26s -> 6303.54s]  We got our first win.
[6303.54s -> 6305.38s]  Now, our morale is high.
[6305.38s -> 6306.66s]  I'm going to tell you right now, I'm going to pop.
[6307.54s -> 6308.10s]  I'm going to pop.
[6308.10s -> 6309.22s]  We're going to pop off.
[6309.22s -> 6310.50s]  We're going to pop off.
[6310.50s -> 6310.98s]  Check this out.
[6310.98s -> 6312.02s]  Gamma's going crazy.
[6312.02s -> 6313.38s]  He's going crazy for sure.
[6317.47s -> 6318.51s]  To all the doubters.
[6318.51s -> 6320.18s]  See you in 10 minutes.
[6321.54s -> 6323.70s]  You do Gamba in your stream?
[6323.70s -> 6324.34s]  Or not Gamba?
[6324.34s -> 6324.98s]  Like, you know.
[6326.42s -> 6327.46s]  No, I don't do like slots or anything.
[6327.46s -> 6328.10s]  Like predictions.
[6328.10s -> 6328.98s]  Predictions, I think.
[6328.98s -> 6330.74s]  Oh, that's bad.
[6330.74s -> 6334.19s]  Yeah, they got one going right now.
[6334.19s -> 6334.59s]  Oh, really?
[6334.59s -> 6336.83s]  It's not popping up for me.
[6336.83s -> 6338.35s]  I got to farm my channel points.
[6339.47s -> 6341.47s]  We up, we up.
[6341.47s -> 6343.10s]  All right.
[6343.10s -> 6343.66s]  That's time.
[6344.98s -> 6345.86s]  All right, now we win.
[6348.58s -> 6349.70s]  We ain't going home yet.
[6352.77s -> 6353.41s]  Let's go.
[6353.41s -> 6354.21s]  Yes, get it in.
[6355.36s -> 6356.56s]  Oxen agitation.
[6356.56s -> 6371.01s]  I'm going for B, I'm going for B now.
[6371.65s -> 6372.21s]  Yep, yep.
[6373.01s -> 6374.29s]  I'm just holding the window, champ.
[6374.93s -> 6379.65s]  They're coming from A, A, A, A.
[6379.65s -> 6380.29s]  Coming from A side?
[6380.29s -> 6381.17s]  Coming from A, yeah, yeah.
[6381.81s -> 6383.78s]  I'm going to take back A fast.
[6383.78s -> 6384.66s]  I got one.
[6385.95s -> 6387.31s]  Actually, we don't need A, just keep seeing.
[6387.31s -> 6388.27s]  Yeah, we don't need A, yeah, we don't need A.
[6388.27s -> 6390.27s]  Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[6390.27s -> 6392.59s]  He's on B, he's on B, he's on B, he's on B, he's on B.
[6392.59s -> 6393.47s]  He's wrong, he's wrong.
[6394.27s -> 6395.44s]  We're good, we're good.
[6395.44s -> 6396.32s]  Nading it.
[6396.32s -> 6397.04s]  Good shit.
[6401.47s -> 6402.75s]  Take his ass out.
[6402.75s -> 6405.78s]  Yeah, I'm going to hold garage.
[6411.42s -> 6413.34s]  I need somebody, I need somebody on the car side.
[6413.34s -> 6414.38s]  Whoa.
[6414.38s -> 6415.50s]  I need somebody on the car side, please.
[6416.14s -> 6416.54s]  I'm looking.
[6418.13s -> 6419.97s]  I'm going to get up, I'm blowing it up.
[6419.97s -> 6420.85s]  No one's out there anymore.
[6421.57s -> 6422.85s]  One mid car, I'm B, I'm B.
[6426.05s -> 6427.79s]  Got him.
[6427.79s -> 6429.55s]  Oh, he tried to light it.
[6429.55s -> 6430.83s]  I got you, I got you.
[6430.83s -> 6432.75s]  I'm B, I'm B, I'm B, I'm B, I'm B, I'm B, I'm B.
[6432.75s -> 6434.11s]  You got to make sure you clear site.
[6434.11s -> 6434.75s]  Yeah, I got you, I got you.
[6434.75s -> 6436.35s]  There you go, there you go, it's good now, it's good now.
[6436.35s -> 6437.15s]  Suppressing fire.
[6437.87s -> 6440.13s]  I'm holding garage.
[6443.26s -> 6445.18s]  John's going to fucking come out of that smoke on site.
[6447.30s -> 6448.34s]  Got two, I'm dead though.
[6448.34s -> 6449.46s]  On site still, on site still.
[6449.46s -> 6451.06s]  On site, on site, on site.
[6451.06s -> 6452.34s]  No, he fucking killed me.
[6454.64s -> 6456.08s]  Oh my god, I can't.
[6456.08s -> 6460.70s]  I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.
[6460.70s -> 6473.57s]  Oh, fuck, we're suppressed here for a minute.
[6473.57s -> 6474.45s]  Let's play out now.
[6475.25s -> 6476.37s]  Getting into window.
[6477.25s -> 6479.94s]  Kill the dude that was playing car cross.
[6480.34s -> 6481.14s]  One in the window.
[6483.26s -> 6486.08s]  Mid car, mid car, trailer.
[6486.08s -> 6490.03s]  We got two, we're up right now.
[6491.36s -> 6492.88s]  Sim dead, I'm going for site.
[6492.88s -> 6494.16s]  It's prone, prone on car.
[6494.16s -> 6496.64s]  Yeah, he's prone on the floor.
[6496.64s -> 6505.90s]  I'm still alive.
[6505.90s -> 6506.06s]  Yes.
[6506.06s -> 6506.70s]  I'm not leaving.
[6511.01s -> 6512.05s]  All right, shake it, shake it, shake it.
[6512.05s -> 6513.33s]  Don't push too hard, don't push too far.
[6513.97s -> 6514.53s]  Come on, flip.
[6515.09s -> 6515.97s]  Just holding this fence.
[6520.29s -> 6521.65s]  I think it flipped, I think it flipped.
[6521.65s -> 6522.13s]  Yeah.
[6522.13s -> 6522.85s]  He was in the house.
[6523.98s -> 6524.62s]  Yeah, it's flipped.
[6526.14s -> 6527.10s]  No, it hasn't.
[6527.10s -> 6527.82s]  Wait, no, no, no, no.
[6531.30s -> 6532.26s]  Oh, my goodness.
[6537.68s -> 6538.88s]  I'm backing out of the spawn.
[6538.88s -> 6539.92s]  Fuck, I think I fucked it.
[6540.74s -> 6541.54s]  Not yet, actually.
[6542.82s -> 6548.74s]  I'm on a fucking beamer, yo.
[6552.75s -> 6553.23s]  One in mid.
[6557.15s -> 6559.79s]  Fuck, dude, that's a big twit on me.
[6559.79s -> 6560.35s]  Yeah, we're good.
[6560.35s -> 6562.35s]  We're playing the objective real nice, man.
[6563.39s -> 6565.63s]  Oh, I got some, I fell down a trip once.
[6565.63s -> 6568.03s]  He ran across, he ran across, he ran across.
[6568.67s -> 6569.95s]  Got one on B.
[6571.58s -> 6572.22s]  We're clear, we're clear.
[6572.22s -> 6573.82s]  Don't have spawn, all right, kill the Buddha.
[6573.82s -> 6574.46s]  Another one B.
[6575.34s -> 6576.78s]  Let's take a seat, let's take a seat.
[6576.86s -> 6577.74s]  Flip it, flip it, flip it.
[6577.74s -> 6578.54s]  Oh, god, I'm fucked.
[6581.14s -> 6582.26s]  Wait, they're still spawning.
[6582.26s -> 6582.66s]  A though?
[6583.74s -> 6585.82s]  Yeah, sometimes it messes up.
[6585.82s -> 6587.66s]  Yeah, that's real luck.
[6587.66s -> 6588.94s]  I'm going to cap C, I'm going to cap C.
[6588.94s -> 6589.58s]  Just play for B.
[6590.46s -> 6597.84s]  Playing for C, play for B still.
[6597.84s -> 6601.97s]  Even if you spawn A, you should be able to retake here.
[6603.65s -> 6609.92s]  Okay, I'm in here, I'm in here, capping B.
[6610.88s -> 6611.90s]  Try to take car.
[6616.67s -> 6617.63s]  Holy fuck, man.
[6623.71s -> 6624.21s]  Got truck.
[6626.48s -> 6628.16s]  Oh, I ran out of ammo.
[6628.16s -> 6629.12s]  Oh, god.
[6633.89s -> 6634.69s]  It's too much smoke.
[6636.54s -> 6637.66s]  Fuck the smoke.
[6637.66s -> 6640.46s]  Going for cap.
[6641.68s -> 6644.00s]  Once on, yeah, two.
[6644.00s -> 6644.50s]  Shit.
[6645.20s -> 6646.62s]  Threw that nade away.
[6647.18s -> 6649.38s]  All right, it's tied up right now.
[6651.78s -> 6652.42s]  Oh, yes.
[6652.42s -> 6653.86s]  You got to run at the end, let's go.
[6654.66s -> 6655.30s]  Comeback season.
[6655.30s -> 6656.42s]  Close one.
[6656.42s -> 6657.38s]  We actually won.
[6667.78s -> 6669.74s]  That was good.
[6669.74s -> 6672.24s]  Yeah, we're up, we're up.
[6672.24s -> 6673.44s]  Look at, look at, hit tab.
[6673.44s -> 6675.12s]  We're out fucking fragging them.
[6678.22s -> 6681.34s]  We are better mechanically, it's just the fucking truth.
[6682.51s -> 6683.63s]  We do have mechanics, we do.
[6683.63s -> 6685.87s]  Okay, there's two of them on site, two of them on B, two of them on B.
[6686.75s -> 6687.47s]  Nading it.
[6688.19s -> 6692.32s]  I'm pushing B, pushing B.
[6692.32s -> 6693.12s]  Get in there, get in there.
[6693.12s -> 6695.52s]  I killed him off of it, I killed him off of it.
[6697.38s -> 6701.22s]  That was a, that was a big explosive.
[6701.94s -> 6702.98s]  Whatever that was.
[6702.98s -> 6704.82s]  He's in the corner, there's two in the corner.
[6705.78s -> 6706.42s]  NB, NB!
[6707.46s -> 6709.15s]  Hell Mary.
[6710.56s -> 6711.84s]  Hell Mary.
[6711.84s -> 6714.78s]  He's still in B, let's go.
[6714.78s -> 6718.35s]  Got him, got him on B.
[6718.35s -> 6720.35s]  In truck.
[6720.35s -> 6722.35s]  Wait, he capped it?
[6722.35s -> 6724.35s]  Oh, no way.
[6724.35s -> 6726.35s]  He's always proning near that fucking box, man.
[6726.35s -> 6729.81s]  Oh bro, those stuns are next level.
[6729.81s -> 6731.81s]  Alright, we gotta take car. If we push car, we have to angle on him.
[6731.81s -> 6733.81s]  Oh my god.
[6733.81s -> 6735.81s]  Dean, push car for us.
[6735.81s -> 6737.81s]  I got you, I got you.
[6737.81s -> 6739.81s]  Okay, let's slow down a little bit.
[6739.81s -> 6741.81s]  They're making mistakes, they're pushing up. One on car, one Dean.
[6741.81s -> 6745.01s]  That fucking cheeky spot.
[6745.01s -> 6747.01s]  Oh, there's another one, there's another one covering him.
[6747.01s -> 6750.14s]  Alright, I gotta wait for you guys.
[6750.14s -> 6754.43s]  It's too much.
[6754.43s -> 6756.43s]  Buddha, it's holding long.
[6756.43s -> 6762.38s]  Oh my goodness.
[6762.38s -> 6767.70s]  Oh, I shot him a
[6767.70s -> 6769.70s]  million times.
[6769.70s -> 6773.54s]  Oh my.
[6773.54s -> 6776.67s]  Where's my
[6776.67s -> 6778.67s]  fucking sensitivity?
[6778.67s -> 6781.74s]  Okay, I just got a knife.
[6781.74s -> 6794.22s]  Emma's dead, he played up.
[6794.22s -> 6796.22s]  I can't even leave.
[6796.22s -> 6798.91s]  I can't do anything.
[6798.91s -> 6800.91s]  I need help on B.
[6800.91s -> 6802.91s]  We can make this happen, we can make this happen right now.
[6802.91s -> 6806.54s]  Got one.
[6806.54s -> 6808.54s]  Got another mid.
[6808.54s -> 6810.54s]  He's up in the window.
[6810.54s -> 6812.54s]  Yeah, I'm on site, he's dead.
[6812.54s -> 6818.11s]  I feel like I'm in times two speed.
[6818.11s -> 6820.11s]  Oh, he's on site.
[6820.11s -> 6828.22s]  I got him, I got him. Got another.
[6828.22s -> 6830.22s]  Let's get this site, this is ours.
[6830.22s -> 6832.22s]  Dean, prone, prone, prone.
[6832.22s -> 6836.83s]  Get it, get it, get it, get it.
[6836.83s -> 6839.26s]  We're doing good.
[6839.26s -> 6841.26s]  We take this, we take this.
[6841.26s -> 6843.26s]  He's right behind the sign.
[6843.26s -> 6846.02s]  He's like right behind the sign.
[6846.02s -> 6850.50s]  What the fuck?
[6850.50s -> 6855.62s]  He's down, he's down, he's down.
[6855.62s -> 6859.14s]  I'm prone, I'm prone.
[6859.14s -> 6861.14s]  We need to push past the band.
[6861.14s -> 6863.14s]  On this next respawn, let's try all going left.
[6863.14s -> 6867.68s]  What the fuck?
[6867.68s -> 6869.68s]  How do I lower this?
[6869.68s -> 6872.67s]  There you go, let's all try taking left.
[6872.67s -> 6874.67s]  Symphony's in our spawn, being a fucking rat man.
[6874.67s -> 6877.49s]  So is Blau.
[6877.49s -> 6881.71s]  We're getting spawn cap sword.
[6881.71s -> 6887.14s]  Yeah, they're inside the house.
[6887.14s -> 6889.14s]  You think they're close enough
[6889.14s -> 6891.14s]  for us to flip,
[6891.14s -> 6893.14s]  but we're not.
[6893.14s -> 6899.60s]  No, they're holding it real good.
[6899.60s -> 6901.60s]  Killed one, killed three.
[6901.60s -> 6903.60s]  Inside trailer, trailer, trailer, trailer.
[6903.60s -> 6905.60s]  Outside of trailer now.
[6905.60s -> 6908.54s]  Oh, John, I forgot about you
[6908.54s -> 6910.54s]  and the fact that you're only playing one fucking corner
[6910.54s -> 6912.54s]  because you're a fucking bitch.
[6912.54s -> 6918.42s]  I'm inside.
[6918.42s -> 6922.00s]  No, the sensitivity is too low.
[6922.00s -> 6924.24s]  Good push, good push, Syke.
[6924.24s -> 6929.28s]  We're good, we're good.
[6929.28s -> 6931.28s]  I'm getting B right now, I'm getting B.
[6931.28s -> 6933.28s]  We got it, let's hold it down.
[6933.28s -> 6945.25s]  Hold it, hold it, hold it.
[6945.25s -> 6948.30s]  Where?
[6948.30s -> 6951.31s]  Outside, running out mid.
[6951.31s -> 6954.90s]  Oh my god.
[6954.90s -> 6964.75s]  I got trailer, I got trailer.
[6964.75s -> 6969.42s]  Is it too late?
[6969.42s -> 6971.42s]  Fuck man.
[6971.42s -> 6973.42s]  Bro, they're on C.
[6980.53s -> 6982.53s]  Is there one more round, or are we done?
[6982.53s -> 6984.53s]  We lost this game?
[6984.53s -> 6986.53s]  Two series, yeah.
[6986.53s -> 6988.77s]  It was a good try, good try.
[6988.77s -> 6998.74s]  It's a hard game.
[6998.74s -> 7000.74s]  Yeah, especially on Nook Town.
[7000.74s -> 7005.34s]  E.G.'s though, guys.
[7005.34s -> 7007.34s]  We did pretty decent-ish.
[7014.88s -> 7019.49s]  I think it crashed.
[7019.49s -> 7024.98s]  No, that was fun.
[7024.98s -> 7026.98s]  I have this problem with Call of Duty
[7026.98s -> 7029.28s]  where I feel like, I'm actually crashing.
[7029.28s -> 7031.28s]  I feel like the game is in like times five
[7031.28s -> 7033.71s]  speed sometimes.
[7033.71s -> 7035.71s]  It's like, I have two times
[7035.71s -> 7038.34s]  speed on a YouTube video, and I'm just like
[7038.34s -> 7040.34s]  where do I, I don't even know where my eyes are supposed to go.
[7040.34s -> 7042.83s]  This way, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[7042.83s -> 7046.22s]  I'm dead. It's such a, yeah,
[7046.22s -> 7049.87s]  it's a crazy fucking game.
[7049.87s -> 7051.87s]  Your sensitivity is 5x.
[7051.87s -> 7060.19s]  I'm on 1.0 sensitivity.
[7060.19s -> 7062.19s]  Yeah, thanks for setting it up.
[7062.19s -> 7064.19s]  That was fun.
[7064.19s -> 7066.19s]  That was a blast.
[7066.19s -> 7068.19s]  That was really fun.
[7068.19s -> 7070.19s]  Let's do it again, it was really fun.
[7070.19s -> 7072.19s]  I actually enjoyed it. Yeah, GG's everybody.
[7072.19s -> 7074.19s]  GG's. GG's.
[7074.19s -> 7076.19s]  GG's.
[7076.19s -> 7078.19s]  Bye-bye.
[7078.19s -> 7084.34s]  See you guys later.
[7084.34s -> 7094.18s]  Shit! I was a bottom bragger!
[7094.18s -> 7096.67s]  No, that was fun, that was fun.
[7096.67s -> 7098.67s]  I'm not a good Call of Duty player, but that was fun.
[7098.67s -> 7100.67s]  Sometimes you gotta play COD.
[7100.67s -> 7104.96s]  Do zombies? I don't, can you do
[7104.96s -> 7108.99s]  zombies through plutonium? No, I have
[7108.99s -> 7122.10s]  fun. How do I do it?
[7122.10s -> 7124.10s]  Yes, I can. How do you play zombies?
[7124.10s -> 7133.74s]  Do I do it? Is there a different thing I have to do?
[7133.74s -> 7141.92s]  Is it a different launcher?
[7141.92s -> 7143.92s]  I've never played COD zombies, I don't know how it works.
[7143.92s -> 7149.02s]  Really? Can I just play it by myself?
[7149.02s -> 7164.45s]  I did? When did I play?
[7164.45s -> 7166.45s]  Whoa, that didn't work.
[7166.45s -> 7169.26s]  That was a hard crash when I tried to open zombies.
[7169.26s -> 7177.97s]  Good job interacting with others, we're proud of you.
[7177.97s -> 7181.73s]  Hope it was entertaining. I had fun.
[7181.73s -> 7184.42s]  The first game I got a bunch of kills.
[7184.42s -> 7192.93s]  I just get so
[7192.93s -> 7197.09s]  flustered. You know, I need
[7197.09s -> 7199.09s]  a seatbelt. I need a seatbelt on this chair.
[7199.09s -> 7201.90s]  You know what I mean? I need a seatbelt
[7201.90s -> 7203.90s]  and straps here
[7203.90s -> 7205.90s]  on my elbows to keep me here.
[7205.90s -> 7208.21s]  Because every time I go to shoot and I
[7208.21s -> 7210.21s]  miss, I start moving and
[7210.21s -> 7212.21s]  jumping around and like shaking my head.
[7212.21s -> 7214.58s]  I need a seatbelt to make it so I can't
[7214.58s -> 7219.12s]  do that. No, a seatbelt.
[7219.12s -> 7223.22s]  Like you're in a rollercoaster.
[7223.22s -> 7225.90s]  Can you imagine if I had like a thing
[7225.90s -> 7231.47s]  over my shoulders? That'd be so stupid.
[7231.47s -> 7234.93s]  I can't open
[7234.93s -> 7240.43s]  zombies. I just like
[7240.43s -> 7247.02s]  you should play mortuary assistant.
[7247.02s -> 7249.58s]  Should I just go to mortuary assistant?
[7249.58s -> 7251.58s]  How long is it? I don't know for how long I'm going to
[7251.58s -> 7259.57s]  stream for. Should we just do it? Yes.
[7259.57s -> 7261.57s]  It's only a couple hours? Is it only a couple hours?
[7261.57s -> 7272.13s]  It's like an hour or two? Alright, yeah, let's do it.
[7272.13s -> 7274.13s]  Let's go.
