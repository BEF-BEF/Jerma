[2.04s -> 8.71s]  Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on explain this to me. How can how can I be late
[9.86s -> 16.57s]  if I don't have a schedule right now? How can I be late if there's no time that I'm supposed to show
[16.57s -> 34.28s]  up? That doesn't make very much logical sense. Sorry I just had to flush a toilet, look weird.
[34.28s -> 38.12s]  Need to change my offline image. Yeah I'm I think I'm just going to delete it.
[38.84s -> 44.41s]  I haven't saved. I'm going to update it. Just haven't been like that's one of those things.
[44.41s -> 53.06s]  that's like leaving a bottle of water on your desk or in your kitchen you know
[53.06s -> 57.76s]  I'm talking about you just leave and a half drank bottle of water is just
[57.76s -> 62.36s]  sitting in the same spot in the kitchen for like a week and you see it every day
[62.36s -> 67.54s]  and you're looking at it and you're like ah I don't know and you walk away from
[67.54s -> 80.56s]  it I do that but with like five bottles yeah that it's just like a water bottle
[80.56s -> 85.44s]  like I see it every day and I'm like should I need to I need like I need to
[85.44s -> 96.74s]  move now whatever I'll see you tomorrow right down the cereal box stream no that
[96.74s -> 105.64s]  was real mr. was mr. mr. Dunwich right I'm gonna give credit where credit is due
[105.64s -> 114.39s]  came up with an amazing idea and I think we're gonna do it so here's the here's
[114.39s -> 118.62s]  the before we get started I gotta just tell you about this brilliant idea so
[118.66s -> 123.10s]  you know the cereal box puzzles that are on the back of every cereal box well not
[123.10s -> 128.00s]  really anymore that was a thing back in like they still do it but not really
[128.00s -> 133.28s]  like they used to every inch of your cereal box back when it been like the
[133.28s -> 139.48s]  mid-90s was a puzzle little like ladders and things to play with and crosswords
[139.48s -> 143.68s]  and now that's like nutritional information you know me like not
[143.68s -> 148.32s]  nowadays on the back of the box it's like well all whole grains and no trans
[148.36s -> 151.28s]  vats get that shit out of here I want the puzzles back I want to I want to
[151.28s -> 162.04s]  fucking like find the five cuckoo birds nobody everyone knows cereal is just
[162.04s -> 166.96s]  dogshit with fucking vitamins injected into it you know what I mean like what
[166.96s -> 170.12s]  you don't eat a bowl of fucking Captain Crunch and go like oh I'm so glad I'm
[170.12s -> 187.76s]  getting my daily C no that's not how it works anyways hi how's everybody doing
[187.76s -> 193.36s]  we're gonna play some more Red Dead today cuz I am officially addicted to
[193.36s -> 198.28s]  the game and I think it's very fun and I have the strict policy on this live
[198.28s -> 206.16s]  stream very strict policy of if I'm having fun doing something I'm gonna do
[206.16s -> 212.05s]  it and we're about to break the four streams in a row well actually no that's
[212.05s -> 217.25s]  not true because lethal but I played lethal league for about four hours so
[217.25s -> 221.57s]  then I never might so this this is like the second Red Dead stream in a row
[221.57s -> 227.20s]  right I don't usually stream the same game more than four or five times in a
[227.20s -> 234.27s]  row so it is still technically legal what's the brilliant idea well anyway so
[234.27s -> 241.23s]  what I want to do which was very nicely suggested to me is I'm going to go on
[241.23s -> 247.87s]  eBay and Amazon and maybe find some old retailers and I'm gonna get like 30
[247.87s -> 252.91s]  boxes of cereal and we're gonna do the puzzles on the stream and we're gonna go
[252.91s -> 262.36s]  over our favorite ones which one had the most challenging puzzle this is I'm
[262.36s -> 266.67s]  gonna fill my room with cereal and we're gonna go one by one we might even do a
[266.67s -> 270.85s]  thing we're okay like Cocoa Puffs here's like a Cocoa Puffs box from like 1990
[270.85s -> 277.07s]  this is gonna hold on a minute this is gonna cost like 10 grand how like okay
[277.07s -> 289.12s]  Cocoa Puffs like old box or something right can I like buy this okay here's
[289.44s -> 295.60s]  one empty General Mills cereal box 2009 Cocoa Puffs 2011 yeah oh yeah these are
[295.60s -> 304.33s]  ten bucks though it's gonna cost ten dollars to buy an empty fucking cereal
[304.33s -> 313.54s]  box from 2007 something about that is just seems not worth it that's buying
[313.54s -> 319.98s]  someone's trash that is buying a person's trash out of their trash can for
[319.98s -> 328.45s]  an exorbitant price ten dollars really that's like come on man that's a little
[328.45s -> 341.76s]  much just make your own puzzles it's $20 for one from 1990 it's this no shame and
[341.76s -> 350.72s]  just finding pictures of it all online oh fuck you're right that's true you
[350.72s -> 354.64s]  don't have to buy the boxes but I don't but then I have to eat the cereal right
[354.64s -> 363.22s]  and that how it works don't I also then need to eat it and test which puzzles
[363.46s -> 371.15s]  which year was the best can you eat cereal from like 1990 what happens if
[371.15s -> 384.46s]  you eat cereal from like 1992 it's pretty bad well yeah at least I'll get
[384.46s -> 395.57s]  my daily C that's correct oh man that's a funny idea though anyways um yes I'm
[395.57s -> 402.40s]  we're just I just want to play Red Dead and I'm here last thing we did if you're
[402.40s -> 407.16s]  curious if you have no idea we just got the bear we just got the bear by the
[407.16s -> 412.32s]  way spoiler alert in case anyone has not played this far in the game just got
[412.32s -> 418.47s]  the bear the legendary bear okay just I mean that I know you saw it on the
[418.47s -> 429.15s]  screen already but now we have this the funny definitely guaranteed every
[429.15s -> 433.51s]  streamer you watch every single one that comes across this hat will wear it
[433.51s -> 449.52s]  guaranteed if this is like the streamer hat isn't it isn't it it's a cool hat
[449.52s -> 459.68s]  oh you dropped some frames oh it was too good to be true we had three days in a
[459.68s -> 467.20s]  row perfect internet it was too good to be true
[468.04s -> 471.56s]  clean your piece for oh I think it really might have been too good to be
[471.56s -> 479.36s]  true I may it may have been too good to be true is it possible was it too good
[479.36s -> 493.46s]  to be true it looks pretty rough right now we'll see we'll see we'll see if it
[493.90s -> 519.16s]  strains itself out quick throw salt over your shoulder I know really okay okay
[519.16s -> 525.49s]  those are the consequences of streaming last night for ten hours I know really
[525.49s -> 538.90s]  well we're gonna see how what happens so welcome and goodbye potentially hasn't
[538.90s -> 546.37s]  happened yet we're just gonna go so I apologize in advance if this is just
[546.37s -> 554.90s]  over before it even begins then let's go yeah my neck is real stiff I don't want
[554.90s -> 559.91s]  to stomp on it that's no you do you need to get you daily see you haven't got it
[559.91s -> 576.46s]  yet this ain't good first of the night no I like I'm like looking over at my OBS
[576.46s -> 585.20s]  time to change the title of stream that one didn't count no I haven't started
[585.20s -> 594.23s]  playing yet I wasn't playing the game I was looking over to see if OBS was
[594.23s -> 606.55s]  stable okay so instead of obsessing over the OBS if it's gonna happen it's gonna
[606.55s -> 622.32s]  happen so here we go turn on your face cam why I want to do like a story

[713.23s -> 719.26s]  have been just the initial little hiccup from me starting my stream because
[719.26s -> 724.36s]  italics is currently streaming too so maybe it was just like oh shit I go yeah
[724.36s -> 743.86s]  I'm fine I'm good I can handle it maybe go to the fence what's the fence got for

[1532.35s -> 1536.71s]  like a small fridge unit we destroy one another one pops up but that makes that
[1536.71s -> 1546.83s]  makes noise to fall from grace I don't want to hear that not to mention the
[1546.83s -> 1551.35s]  fact that Catherine's great weight has a rather air conditioner inside of here
[1551.35s -> 1557.75s]  red horses add an extra forty dollars to the big the majestic retail price you
[1557.75s -> 1563.40s]  know I mean well that's the rumor but the grays and the brave weights think the
[1563.40s -> 1568.36s]  other stole the fortune from but it happened so long ago I don't know for

[1774.72s -> 1797.07s]  LULs and shit content just wait till we get up my long rifle
[1797.07s -> 1802.89s]  once did I tell you boys what did I say I said this place was crawling with
[1802.89s -> 1807.83s]  vermin and we just found ourselves the rats nest our excellence as they say in
[1807.83s -> 1812.35s]  Paris I mean he's talking liberal or metaphorical I don't know this well the
[1812.35s -> 1817.23s]  way I actually let my friend here decide he doesn't have your fine way

[1823.03s -> 1843.49s]  throat up each each throat oh I'd say let's go right I think that's probably a
[1843.49s -> 1871.78s]  better idea yeah what was that I was gonna say something but I didn't I was

[6921.07s -> 6932.36s]  months back in like 2008 it was worth waiting I think it's time to change on

[6968.69s -> 6976.09s]  brawl was the most anticipated smash game that of all of them that have been
[6976.09s -> 6999.05s]  made so far I would say that that's just shooting with my horse girl come here
[6999.05s -> 7008.14s]  you don't get an accident with somebody and start shooting them I did not

[7314.40s -> 7316.40s]  the recoil
[7316.40s -> 7321.52s]  shot him backwards
[7321.52s -> 7324.85s]  he slipped into the river
[7324.85s -> 7326.85s]  the water pulled him downstream
[7326.85s -> 7329.22s]  so quick
[7329.22s -> 7331.22s]  it all happened so fast
[7331.22s -> 7334.29s]  I didn't know what to do
[7334.29s -> 7336.29s]  I searched up and down that river bank
[7336.29s -> 7338.29s]  for days
[7338.29s -> 7341.11s]  but I couldn't find my boy

[8488.05s -> 8490.68s]  bets are open now
[8490.68s -> 8492.68s]  double down is the only way I can make
[8492.68s -> 8498.63s]  an achievement here

[8575.64s -> 8578.13s]  that's bad
[8578.13s -> 8580.13s]  remember you always got to assume
[8580.13s -> 8582.13s]  that the dealer has a ten under there so
[8582.13s -> 8584.13s]  I mean I could stand here or I could fucking
[8584.13s -> 8586.13s]  hit it and I think I'm gonna hit it
[8590.92s -> 8595.72s]  thirteen

[8609.96s -> 8611.96s]  twenty
[8611.96s -> 8617.08s]  you gotta always assume
[8617.08s -> 8619.08s]  that there's a ten under there
[8619.08s -> 8622.15s]  the dealer is forced to play
[8622.15s -> 8624.15s]  until seventeen that's correct
[8634.07s -> 8637.27s]  fucking three
[8637.27s -> 8642.00s]  oh that's a five
[8642.00s -> 8644.31s]  that's a fucking eight
[8644.31s -> 8646.31s]  bullshit

[8679.35s -> 8681.35s]  doesn't exist that's why you never played a full table
[8681.35s -> 8688.26s]  idiot
[8688.26s -> 8690.26s]  thank god
[8690.26s -> 8692.82s]  that guy was definitely
[8692.82s -> 8694.82s]  the bad luck on the table
[8696.82s -> 8698.82s]  the guy with the bad luck on the
[8698.82s -> 8700.82s]  table
[8700.82s -> 8703.19s]  watch this
[8711.38s -> 8713.38s]  see
[8713.38s -> 8716.71s]  although he'll make
[8716.71s -> 8718.71s]  him like twenty one with a fucking
[8718.71s -> 8720.71s]  god damn it man
[8720.71s -> 8725.83s]  am I allowed to win a hand
[8725.83s -> 8731.72s]  of blackjack or what
[8731.72s -> 8733.72s]  I'm gonna push every time and then lose
[8733.72s -> 8735.72s]  I need to double
[8735.72s -> 8738.60s]  I need to get this achievement
[8738.60s -> 8740.60s]  there's a challenge to double down and win
[8740.60s -> 8742.60s]  you need to be in the right position
[8742.60s -> 8745.73s]  what a great start
[8745.73s -> 8748.10s]  here it is
[8748.10s -> 8753.28s]  no

[8772.85s -> 8774.85s]  twenty like just let me win
[8774.85s -> 8776.85s]  it's the stupidest thing ever
[8776.85s -> 8778.85s]  I'm gonna push again
[8801.57s -> 8804.39s]  let me guess is he gonna get a twenty
[8804.39s -> 8806.88s]  that's nineteen so what is he gonna have
[8810.88s -> 8813.32s]  deal of showing
[8813.32s -> 8815.32s]  a six is like
[8815.32s -> 8817.32s]  the biggest chance for you to win
[8817.32s -> 8819.32s]  and here comes the bust
[8819.32s -> 8821.32s]  what the fuck
[8821.32s -> 8824.64s]  why
[8826.64s -> 8830.04s]  a deal of showing six is like
[8830.04s -> 8832.04s]  the easiest
[8832.04s -> 8834.04s]  most in your favor thing to win
[8836.04s -> 8838.04s]  can I fucking win
[8838.04s -> 8840.04s]  anything I haven't even lost anything
[8840.04s -> 8842.79s]  I've lost like two hands
[8842.79s -> 8844.79s]  should I throw the table over
[8844.79s -> 8846.79s]  and fucking karate chop this guy or what
[8846.79s -> 8849.16s]  seventeen
[8849.16s -> 8851.16s]  whatever
[8851.16s -> 8853.16s]  this is a hand to win
[8853.16s -> 8855.97s]  he's gonna pull over a ten
[8855.97s -> 8858.98s]  he's gonna bust
[8858.98s -> 8860.98s]  nine

[8964.34s -> 8966.34s]  cause he's gonna bust
[8966.34s -> 8968.84s]  I told you
[8968.84s -> 8970.84s]  I gotta play fucking blackjack fundamentals
[8974.93s -> 8979.92s]  you're supposed to stand there

[9010.10s -> 9012.10s]  come on man
[9014.10s -> 9017.24s]  you're like the grandmother that sits at the slot machine
[9017.24s -> 9019.24s]  and plays one line one credit
[9019.24s -> 9021.24s]  and they sit there all day and smoke
[9021.24s -> 9023.24s]  four packs of cigarettes
[9027.60s -> 9029.60s]  what's his card fifteen

[9054.88s -> 9064.21s]  hmm
[9064.21s -> 9066.21s]  I'm about to pull the gun off
[9068.21s -> 9074.23s]  that's it
[9074.23s -> 9076.23s]  just double down every time
[9076.23s -> 9081.80s]  I'm gonna lose all my money
[9085.32s -> 9087.32s]  just give me something more
[9087.32s -> 9089.32s]  it's twenty but I don't
[9089.32s -> 9091.32s]  I want like an eleven
[9091.32s -> 9093.32s]  you know what I mean
[9093.32s -> 9095.32s]  something I can actually double down on
[9095.32s -> 9097.32s]  like give me a ten or nine
[9097.32s -> 9099.32s]  nine ten eleven
[9099.32s -> 9101.32s]  eleven
[9101.32s -> 9103.32s]  oh what the hell
[9103.32s -> 9110.74s]  at least I fucking won
[9110.74s -> 9112.74s]  I can't double down on every hand
[9112.74s -> 9114.74s]  because if it's a hand like
[9114.74s -> 9116.74s]  you'll just bust the hand
[9116.74s -> 9118.74s]  bets are open now
[9118.74s -> 9120.74s]  I told you guys I'm not addicted to this
[9120.74s -> 9122.74s]  I'm just doing this for the achievement because
[9122.74s -> 9124.74s]  there's a challenge
[9124.74s -> 9126.74s]  you want me to unlock the outfit
[9126.74s -> 9130.77s]  there's a gambler outfit I need to do the challenges
[9130.77s -> 9132.77s]  give me two
[9132.77s -> 9134.95s]  sixteen
[9134.95s -> 9136.95s]  this is like the worst thing
[9136.95s -> 9138.95s]  this is the worst position
[9138.95s -> 9140.95s]  to be in
[9140.95s -> 9142.95s]  fifteen versus seventeen
[9142.95s -> 9144.95s]  like what the fuck am I supposed to do here
[9144.95s -> 9146.95s]  I'm probably gonna have to stand it
[9146.95s -> 9148.95s]  I mean
[9148.95s -> 9150.95s]  you're supposed to hit but
[9150.95s -> 9160.85s]  got it
[9160.85s -> 9163.86s]  that guy just double down
[9163.86s -> 9165.86s]  can I just move up with one seat
[9167.86s -> 9169.86s]  don't you do it
[9169.86s -> 9172.61s]  nineteen
[9172.61s -> 9176.96s]  you're gonna double down and win five times
[9176.96s -> 9178.96s]  double down yeah
[9178.96s -> 9180.96s]  I mean I guess I could just play
[9180.96s -> 9182.96s]  okay I'm gonna play four cent bets
[9182.96s -> 9185.40s]  and double down every single
[9185.40s -> 9187.40s]  time until I win five times
[9189.40s -> 9191.40s]  I did four cents and here comes blackjack
[9191.40s -> 9200.42s]  double down
[9203.24s -> 9207.20s]  I mean I need to stand on it
[9207.20s -> 9209.20s]  why would I hit out of nineteen
[9209.20s -> 9211.20s]  fifteen
[9215.83s -> 9217.83s]  if you did that at like a
[9217.83s -> 9219.83s]  blackjack table the whole table would turn
[9219.83s -> 9221.83s]  and be like what the fuck did you just do
[9232.13s -> 9238.92s]  I just need to win
[9238.92s -> 9240.92s]  we just gotta get it out of our system and do it here
[9243.35s -> 9245.35s]  nine, two, give me a two
[9245.35s -> 9247.78s]  you had to give me a three
[9247.78s -> 9249.78s]  and yet it's a king
[9249.78s -> 9253.17s]  that's fantastic
[9253.17s -> 9255.17s]  a twelve versus a twenty
[9255.17s -> 9257.73s]  wonderful might as well double
[9257.73s -> 9259.73s]  fucking down
[9259.73s -> 9261.73s]  okay

[9273.27s -> 9277.24s]  my fucking god
[9277.24s -> 9280.50s]  you just have to always assume
[9280.50s -> 9283.83s]  I've been here for four days
[9283.83s -> 9285.83s]  I'm not going to shotgun
[9285.83s -> 9287.83s]  joke anyone here

[9290.84s -> 9293.91s]  shotgun, no
[9295.91s -> 9297.91s]  refuse to double down on two cent bets
[9297.91s -> 9300.60s]  yeah, fifteen
[9300.60s -> 9302.60s]  might as well, versus an eight
[9302.60s -> 9304.60s]  might as well double down and lose
[9310.40s -> 9312.40s]  oh that's a bust Kermit
[9312.40s -> 9314.40s]  I do believe
[9314.40s -> 9318.48s]  I'm gonna win
[9318.48s -> 9321.43s]  you make twenty one out of this I'm fucking
[9321.43s -> 9326.16s]  we'll do the shotgun joke
[9326.16s -> 9333.08s]  alright just need to do that four more times
[9335.08s -> 9337.08s]  I appreciate a diversion
[9337.08s -> 9339.08s]  what did that guy just do
[9342.60s -> 9344.60s]  forty cents
[9344.60s -> 9346.77s]  alright give me a
[9346.77s -> 9348.77s]  there's blackjack on a forty cent bet
[9348.77s -> 9352.16s]  or
[9352.16s -> 9354.16s]  I could just double down
[9354.16s -> 9356.16s]  oh they don't let you do it
[9360.00s -> 9364.16s]  you can do that
[9364.16s -> 9366.16s]  you don't have to take the blackjack
[9366.16s -> 9368.16s]  what the hell

[9416.87s -> 9419.24s]  on a blackjack
[9419.24s -> 9421.24s]  this is where you are
[9421.24s -> 9423.24s]  there are plenty of casinos around here that you don't have to take the blackjack
[9423.24s -> 9425.24s]  you can just play it
[9429.72s -> 9431.72s]  double down here it comes

[9444.37s -> 9447.19s]  yeah that's true
[9447.19s -> 9449.19s]  and this guy came back

[9507.06s -> 9509.30s]  did that not count
[9509.30s -> 9515.44s]  why did the counter not show up
[9531.33s -> 9534.92s]  it shows the first progress you did get it okay
[9536.92s -> 9538.92s]  I'm playing blackjack so awfully right now
[9538.92s -> 9540.92s]  but it's just to double down
[9540.92s -> 9542.92s]  every hand
[9542.92s -> 9544.92s]  I would have won if I didn't fucking do that
[9544.92s -> 9551.00s]  see you in sixty minutes when we get
[9551.00s -> 9553.00s]  three other double downs
[9555.49s -> 9558.63s]  how much money do I have
[9558.63s -> 9562.85s]  I'm just running out of money I have to be careful

[9587.57s -> 9589.57s]  fifteen

[9591.57s -> 9594.71s]  sixteen
[9594.71s -> 9596.71s]  that's almost impossible to do that
[9596.71s -> 9600.48s]  consecutively
[9600.48s -> 9602.48s]  I'm just looking for a bust here
[9602.48s -> 9604.48s]  fourteen bust

[9736.80s -> 9738.80s]  double down and try to get an ace
[9738.80s -> 9740.80s]  I would have had it
[9740.80s -> 9743.17s]  I would have got it
[9743.17s -> 9745.17s]  if I double down right there I would have got that ace
[9745.17s -> 9749.65s]  fifteen
[9749.65s -> 9751.96s]  you gotta be kidding me

[9778.55s -> 9780.55s]  twenty you can't double down on twenty
[9780.55s -> 9783.30s]  I can't believe

[9823.16s -> 9825.16s]  anyone that just comes in right now
[9825.16s -> 9827.33s]  will just think I'm an idiot
[9827.33s -> 9829.33s]  that I just don't understand this game
[9829.33s -> 9831.76s]  I just double down every hand
[9831.76s -> 9833.76s]  it's double the money
[9833.76s -> 9835.76s]  what does that mean

[9889.80s -> 9892.10s]  yeah
[9892.10s -> 9894.10s]  blackjack requires zero skill
[9894.10s -> 9896.10s]  I have a little bit
[9896.10s -> 9898.10s]  of news for you here
[9898.10s -> 9900.10s]  none of them do
[9900.10s -> 9902.10s]  the only one that requires any actual
[9902.10s -> 9904.10s]  real skill is poker
[9904.10s -> 9907.24s]  thank you very much
[9907.24s -> 9910.50s]  none of these do
[9910.50s -> 9914.15s]  I'll do two cents

[9944.10s -> 9949.09s]  eighteen
[9949.09s -> 9951.09s]  some of the card games require thought
[9951.09s -> 9953.33s]  but skill
[9953.33s -> 9955.57s]  skill
[9955.57s -> 9957.57s]  oh I don't have enough money to double down
[9957.57s -> 9959.57s]  here I'm getting up
[9959.57s -> 9961.57s]  thank you
[9961.57s -> 9963.57s]  they require thought but at the end
[9963.57s -> 9965.57s]  of the day it's random cards
[9965.57s -> 9967.57s]  being thrown down
[9967.57s -> 9974.42s]  I need to get it
[9974.42s -> 9981.59s]  one more time
[9981.59s -> 9983.59s]  I have to get it double down one more time
[9983.59s -> 9987.30s]  so then we can be done with this
[9987.30s -> 9989.30s]  he sits down at the slot machine and is like
[9989.30s -> 9991.30s]  wow I'm really good at this
[9991.30s -> 9997.64s]  you mean to tell me that there's
[9997.64s -> 9999.64s]  a computer algorithm
[9999.64s -> 10001.64s]  that makes me lose
[10001.64s -> 10003.64s]  eighty five percent of the time
[10003.64s -> 10006.39s]  but no this is the special
[10006.39s -> 10008.39s]  machine I sit at this one
[10008.39s -> 10010.39s]  I take up the whole row
[10010.39s -> 10012.39s]  of this one
[10012.39s -> 10014.69s]  buffalo machine
[10014.69s -> 10016.69s]  and I put in five cents on each one
[10016.69s -> 10018.69s]  and I go click click click click click click
[10018.69s -> 10024.18s]  across the whole row
[10024.18s -> 10026.74s]  how much did I just bet?
[10026.74s -> 10034.08s]  no

[10038.58s -> 10043.51s]  bets
[10053.11s -> 10058.23s]  okay we got eights
[10058.23s -> 10061.81s]  we're splitting it
[10061.81s -> 10063.81s]  no blackjack right? we're splitting these eights
[10063.81s -> 10065.81s]  split them
[10065.81s -> 10070.80s]  oh baby
[10070.80s -> 10074.05s]  ten
[10074.05s -> 10077.62s]  do it again

[10090.88s -> 10094.72s]  eighteen
[10094.72s -> 10096.72s]  by the way splitting eights
[10096.72s -> 10098.72s]  versus a face card on the table
[10098.72s -> 10100.72s]  do not ever do this
[10100.72s -> 10103.28s]  for any reason
[10103.28s -> 10105.28s]  don't ever do that
[10105.28s -> 10108.48s]  I did it for the effect of the comedy
[10108.48s -> 10110.48s]  there you go that's why you don't do that
[10110.48s -> 10112.48s]  that's the reason why you never do that
[10112.48s -> 10117.92s]  always split eights
[10117.92s -> 10119.92s]  as in eights I disagree
[10119.92s -> 10121.92s]  because if the guy's showing a face card
[10121.92s -> 10123.92s]  you're going to lose twice as much money
[10123.92s -> 10125.92s]  like right there he flipped it over
[10125.92s -> 10127.92s]  I would say in the German on eight five
[10127.92s -> 10130.87s]  gambler's handbook
[10130.87s -> 10132.87s]  I know the always split eights
[10132.87s -> 10134.87s]  no matter what

[10657.68s -> 10659.68s]  you don't get a lot of traveling men here
[10659.68s -> 10661.68s]  and suddenly there's a whole phalanx
[10661.68s -> 10663.68s]  of mysterious but strangely
[10663.68s -> 10665.68s]  helpful yankees
[10665.68s -> 10667.68s]  what are you doing here
[10667.68s -> 10669.68s]  I'm just looking for work

[10686.05s -> 10688.05s]  Penelope
[10688.05s -> 10690.05s]  but it's impossible
[10690.05s -> 10692.05s]  love tends to be complicated
[10692.05s -> 10694.05s]  she's a Braithwaite
[10694.05s -> 10696.05s]  I'm Beau Grey son of Tavish Grey
[10696.05s -> 10698.05s]  nephew of Lee Grey
[10698.05s -> 10700.05s]  the sheriff grandson of old Murdo Grey

[10706.05s -> 10708.05s]  quite explain why
[10708.05s -> 10710.05s]  but just because he's got the fucking hair
[10710.05s -> 10712.05s]  all of a sudden he becomes me
[10712.05s -> 10714.05s]  all to some nonsense while she
[10714.05s -> 10716.05s]  she's amazing
[10716.05s -> 10718.05s]  she's like a woman
[10718.05s -> 10720.05s]  from the future she's like
[10720.05s -> 10722.05s]  tomorrow if tomorrow turns out
[10722.05s -> 10724.05s]  fine well I'm sorry
[10724.05s -> 10726.05s]  for your predicament would you help

[10736.05s -> 10738.05s]  money I know
[10738.05s -> 10740.05s]  she loves to sit out in the gazebo
[10740.05s -> 10742.05s]  on the edge of the Braithwaite property
[10742.05s -> 10744.05s]  take her this letter
[10744.05s -> 10746.05s]  and this bracelet
[10746.05s -> 10751.30s]  please
[10751.30s -> 10753.30s]  and you'll never hear from me ever again
[10753.30s -> 10760.08s]  sneak into the grounds
[10760.08s -> 10762.08s]  around Braithwaite
[10762.08s -> 10768.55s]  manor where's my
[10768.55s -> 10770.55s]  little friend
[10770.55s -> 10784.04s]  come on then
[10784.04s -> 10786.04s]  what the fuck happened what the
[10786.04s -> 10788.04s]  fuck what
[10788.04s -> 10790.21s]  wow that scared the shit out
[10790.21s -> 10792.21s]  of me what
[10792.21s -> 10800.64s]  what hey
[10800.64s -> 10802.64s]  I'm getting shot out of a cannon
[10802.64s -> 10814.80s]  we won't run over anybody
[10814.80s -> 10822.98s]  shut up
[10822.98s -> 10825.41s]  two guards who do you think you are
[10825.41s -> 10837.89s]  that was a little delayed reaction
[10837.89s -> 10841.86s]  on my part
[10841.86s -> 10849.28s]  that's pretty good music
[10849.28s -> 10861.57s]  I still have no shoes on
[10861.57s -> 10868.21s]  sorry
[10868.21s -> 10870.21s]  so sneak into this manor
[10870.21s -> 10875.46s]  workers watch out for workers
[10875.46s -> 10879.36s]  they're like landmines
[10879.36s -> 10897.73s]  you guys don't want to step on them
[10897.73s -> 10912.90s]  what sneak past the guards
[10912.90s -> 10914.90s]  so there are
[10914.90s -> 10916.90s]  there's a guy that way
[10916.90s -> 10920.36s]  I can't see the manor
[10920.36s -> 10922.72s]  it's so foggy
[10922.72s -> 10927.01s]  there's the manor
[10927.01s -> 10929.25s]  I think there's one guard out front
[10929.25s -> 10932.26s]  but there might be another one
[10932.26s -> 10934.26s]  is that it? I think it's just this one guy
[10934.26s -> 10941.04s]  he's right there
[10941.04s -> 10943.04s]  ahh he's turning
[10943.04s -> 10959.17s]  how close do they have to be
[10959.17s -> 10961.54s]  I guess maybe not that
[10961.54s -> 10982.92s]  I guess I'm fine
[10982.92s -> 10988.04s]  I'm just going to keep it expanded the whole time
[10988.04s -> 10994.05s]  why don't you do the double foot
[10994.05s -> 10999.94s]  stomp there
[10999.94s -> 11001.94s]  how much further away are you
[11001.94s -> 11013.59s]  where is Penelope
[11013.59s -> 11018.39s]  you just sit at the lake
[11018.39s -> 11025.48s]  apparently
[11025.48s -> 11027.48s]  I don't think there's anybody else
[11027.48s -> 11063.43s]  wet socks
[11063.43s -> 11069.89s]  I don't have any socks on
[11069.89s -> 11071.89s]  I made it so does she know I'm coming
[11071.89s -> 11096.07s]  I made it
[11102.44s -> 11105.83s]  a gift
[11105.83s -> 11108.26s]  what a gift well we don't even know each other
[11108.26s -> 11110.26s]  well it's not from me it's from
[11110.26s -> 11112.26s]  from Bo
[11112.26s -> 11114.26s]  oh he's
[11114.26s -> 11116.26s]  so strange
[11116.26s -> 11118.26s]  yes he's a little strange
[11118.26s -> 11120.26s]  but also so
[11120.26s -> 11122.26s]  human the rest of our families
[11122.26s -> 11124.26s]  are stuck in the dark ages
[11124.26s -> 11126.26s]  well I don't know
[11126.26s -> 11128.26s]  cave people perhaps
[11128.26s -> 11130.26s]  Bo's different
[11130.26s -> 11132.26s]  but if they find out
[11132.26s -> 11134.26s]  they'll kill him and send me to live
[11134.26s -> 11136.26s]  someplace awesome handsome
[11136.26s -> 11138.26s]  smart funny
[11138.26s -> 11140.26s]  have you ever been to Ohio sir
[11140.26s -> 11142.26s]  no well neither have I
[11142.26s -> 11144.26s]  but my uncle has a factory there
[11144.26s -> 11146.26s]  he was sort of the black sheep
[11146.26s -> 11148.26s]  on account of having left
[11148.26s -> 11150.26s]  but now they tolerate him
[11150.26s -> 11152.26s]  because he's a vicious snob
[11152.26s -> 11154.63s]  families
[11154.63s -> 11156.63s]  are are
[11156.63s -> 11158.63s]  there's something else
[11158.63s -> 11160.63s]  you got a family sir
[11160.63s -> 11162.63s]  well they tolerate him
[11162.63s -> 11164.63s]  because of the money but me
[11164.63s -> 11166.63s]  with my ideas above my station
[11166.63s -> 11168.63s]  they can't stand
[11168.63s -> 11170.63s]  that sounds pretty complicated
[11170.63s -> 11172.63s]  I don't know
[11172.63s -> 11174.63s]  quite what to say nothing to say
[11174.63s -> 11176.63s]  except I hope they all rot
[11176.63s -> 11178.87s]  I don't
[11178.87s -> 11181.17s]  well maybe a bit
[11181.17s -> 11183.17s]  why'd I have to sneak up on this lady because the
[11183.17s -> 11185.17s]  guards there would not let me in
[11185.17s -> 11187.41s]  will you give this to him
[11187.41s -> 11193.56s]  sure leave the area
[11193.56s -> 11195.56s]  without being seen
[11195.56s -> 11198.95s]  well
[11198.95s -> 11200.95s]  there's a big body of water right here
[11200.95s -> 11203.19s]  that looks pretty good to me
[11203.19s -> 11223.01s]  wait hold on
[11223.01s -> 11225.01s]  I'm not going to swim across
[11225.01s -> 11227.01s]  the Atlantic
[11227.01s -> 11231.62s]  hold on a minute not the Atlantic
[11231.62s -> 11233.62s]  the Pacific what of an ocean
[11233.62s -> 11239.44s]  I'm going to swim this way

[11295.36s -> 11297.36s]  it really is just one two three
[11297.36s -> 11303.00s]  three two one this sounds like
[11303.00s -> 11305.00s]  when you used to have CDs on in the car
[11305.00s -> 11307.00s]  and they would just skip

[16461.34s -> 16464.28s]  Okay. Bye. That was fun
[16464.44s -> 16479.22s]  What's the purpose of this?
[16479.38s -> 16482.58s]  My first person to train I can
[16483.62s -> 16490.14s]  Like it matters
[16490.14s -> 16520.39s]  my poor horse
[16520.39s -> 16523.19s]  So we're but it all takes us back to the city
[16524.97s -> 16526.17s]  I guess
[16526.17s -> 16537.38s]  It's fine
[16537.38s -> 16544.30s]  Okay, what if I get robbed?
[16544.30s -> 16546.30s]  What if somebody tries to stop this train?
[16546.78s -> 16560.79s]  How would they stop this they wouldn't
[16564.47s -> 16569.37s]  Hey

[16572.25s -> 16574.17s]  Just don't stop
[16574.17s -> 16583.14s]  I can't go faster as fast as I can go
[16591.50s -> 16593.50s]  What about other trains
[16595.99s -> 16597.91s]  Can I back up?
[16597.91s -> 16599.59s]  Into another train
[16599.59s -> 16602.84s]  What's happening over there?
[16602.84s -> 16604.44s]  Oh, it's an alligator

[16699.02s -> 16723.85s]  I mean, I have to hit somebody with the train
[16724.57s -> 16729.35s]  You know, I like I can't go this far into this populated city and not just run a person over
[16730.31s -> 16738.02s]  We need to do like maximum overdrive and just wait for somebody to get in the way and then fucking hit the gas
[16751.26s -> 16756.78s]  Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Everybody fucking hold on. Hold on
[16769.43s -> 16770.63s]  Wait

[16778.14s -> 16779.98s]  That's not gonna happen
[16779.98s -> 16782.94s]  I'm gonna tie up like 50 people and put them on tracks and then driving
[16783.90s -> 16792.87s]  I need to save the game here man, because this is a this is
[16793.75s -> 16797.02s]  This potential here. Oh, I can't save
[16797.74s -> 16808.55s]  They're never gonna stop me ever
[16809.27s -> 16815.67s]  I can go right back. What are they gonna do get on the train?
[16816.63s -> 16831.30s]  I hope they find me
[16831.30s -> 16833.14s]  Wanted Arthur Morgan
[16833.14s -> 16838.15s]  investigating
[16838.15s -> 16839.91s]  Oh, damn it
[16839.91s -> 16847.59s]  They don't know where I am. I'm hiding in plain sight
[16848.23s -> 16850.50s]  the guy on the train
[16850.50s -> 16859.14s]  When somebody cross

[16928.22s -> 16930.22s]  He's a psycho
[16930.38s -> 16951.80s]  Did I get him? I got him. Where are you going?
[16952.84s -> 16962.25s]  Oh, I so badly want to be able to turn this around
[16963.53s -> 16970.38s]  I feel like I can't give up this opportunity
[16971.10s -> 16983.91s]  See, i'm just a train right now. Okay. I don't know. I'm I am a train
[16984.63s -> 16989.18s]  I need someone to cross this
[16989.50s -> 17020.66s]  I need a carriage
[17020.66s -> 17022.66s]  That's so important
[17027.51s -> 17038.84s]  I feel like we keep rewinding the same video
[17039.72s -> 17047.27s]  Come on. Come on. Come on

[17164.23s -> 17166.76s]  Get him
[17166.76s -> 17169.13s]  Watch out for that horse
[17171.05s -> 17175.77s]  That guy just shot a random person that person had nothing to do with it
[17179.24s -> 17201.69s]  I have to get out of here. This has to stop at some point, right?
[17204.94s -> 17208.70s]  It's just gonna go on the sun has set like twice
[17211.80s -> 17213.80s]  The sun has gone down now
[17216.52s -> 17220.66s]  For like two days, I can't figure out how to stop him
[17234.28s -> 17239.21s]  My fucking back hurts
[17239.90s -> 17241.90s]  Oh, they hit me. They're actually hitting me
[17242.62s -> 17249.46s]  Where's my horse?
[17249.46s -> 17251.06s]  Horses over there
[17251.06s -> 17257.05s]  Can you see him?
[17257.05s -> 17260.49s]  You see he's fine. He's over there. He's fine. He made it see him down there
[17268.47s -> 17271.54s]  I think I ran a guy over
[17274.30s -> 17276.30s]  Yeah, yeah

[17679.00s -> 17681.00s]  I think he's stuck on it still
[17681.61s -> 17686.25s]  Is he still on it?
[17686.25s -> 17688.41s]  I won't miss this train. Is that what this lady's saying?
[17689.13s -> 17698.58s]  I gotta I gotta get to a
[17698.58s -> 17700.50s]  car crossing
[17700.50s -> 17719.21s]  Oh, he's gonna get to a place where the carriages come
[17720.98s -> 17723.62s]  I'm going to run over every single
[17724.82s -> 17748.70s]  How could they possibly lose you because they don't understand that
[17749.26s -> 17752.22s]  I'm in the train, so i'm technically under cover
[17753.58s -> 17763.56s]  I'm just gonna get to a crossing
[17764.54s -> 17766.14s]  Wherever that may be

[17773.85s -> 17783.06s]  So now he's just gonna come across
[17783.86s -> 17787.32s]  Across what?

[17792.74s -> 17807.46s]  Which way does it go? Can I direct which way it goes?
[17808.58s -> 17812.74s]  I don't think I can
[17812.74s -> 17817.83s]  But is that track for another train?
[17817.83s -> 17826.63s]  Um, somebody's tell me if i'm wrong here, but is this can I crash into the other train?
[17827.99s -> 17837.82s]  Is that just not gonna happen?
[17837.82s -> 17845.53s]  Oh, we're going way up in wilderness here. I'm not sure if we're gonna make it
[17847.69s -> 17851.21s]  Oh, we're going all the way up all the way. Where this is we're going deep

[17991.32s -> 17993.32s]  We're filling this train with passengers
[18002.84s -> 18006.44s]  No amount of blood and death will be able to suffice this train
[18008.76s -> 18012.30s]  I'm gonna fill i'm gonna fill it until there's no more room
[18013.70s -> 18017.06s]  Like it's a storage house like a where like one of those storage units
[18027.05s -> 18051.50s]  How I wonder if I dedicate myself to this if I can fill this with people it's worth a shot

[18108.86s -> 18112.70s]  I'm gonna come to like a stop and they're all gonna go flying out
[18114.01s -> 18116.01s]  It's going to be a disaster
[18128.41s -> 18130.65s]  Because they can't they can't stop me. You know what i'm saying?
[18131.46s -> 18133.22s]  I cannot be stopped
[18133.22s -> 18135.54s]  The only way that I can be stopped here is if these people despawn
[18136.10s -> 18147.42s]  We'll find out now. They're still in there
[18151.24s -> 18153.24s]  They're still in there

[18177.64s -> 18183.34s]  because this is the
[18183.58s -> 18187.11s]  Let me just get this straight
[18187.11s -> 18190.39s]  This is the one that was just the the actual video game, right?
[18200.47s -> 18202.71s]  Because whatever this one is, what is it gonna be called?
[18205.14s -> 18209.38s]  Because I want to make sure I can go back to the actual game after this nonsense. Here's the problem

[18272.23s -> 18280.73s]  How many?
[18280.73s -> 18296.50s]  Hmm
[18296.50s -> 18301.85s]  I'm gonna go too far
[18301.85s -> 18304.73s]  Because they might despawn if I go too far now that I think about that
[18308.09s -> 18309.29s]  Let's find out
[18309.29s -> 18311.78s]  Train's still there. Mm-hmm
[18313.61s -> 18347.46s]  Can't tell if it's still in there though
[18347.46s -> 18350.39s]  Don't worry. I'll take care of it after
[18350.39s -> 18351.83s]  They're still on the train
[18351.83s -> 18364.92s]  I'm gonna lead them back here

[18481.59s -> 18483.59s]  I gotta be very very aware of my health
[18493.21s -> 18495.21s]  If I die the whole thing is over
[18517.50s -> 18519.50s]  The train it hungers
[18521.83s -> 18524.47s]  Just i'm gonna see i'm gonna save after every major, uh

[18598.07s -> 18627.37s]  All right
[18630.18s -> 18632.18s]  I'll sit here and feed it all day
[18638.34s -> 18640.66s]  It auto-aimed the horse's head. I didn't do that
[18641.46s -> 18643.06s]  Oh that hurts
[18643.06s -> 18651.32s]  What was that?
[18653.18s -> 18668.87s]  Fuck if only I had my other weapons
[18671.56s -> 18688.87s]  Bitch if only I didn't run my fucking horse over
[18690.07s -> 18693.26s]  Actually, this is pretty good. I'm not i'm okay with this
[18694.22s -> 18702.90s]  Take their weapons
[18702.90s -> 18704.58s]  Why did I not even think about that?
[18704.58s -> 18737.19s]  I have a lot of bodies to loot. That's for sure
[18737.19s -> 18746.14s]  Well, we're gonna test the power of the playstation 4. Can they fall out the windows? I don't think so
[18746.62s -> 18760.25s]  Now I need to get I need to get some big bulky animals in there. I'm talking big elk deer alligators
[18762.42s -> 18768.25s]  It's just noah's ark. Yeah, i'm not gonna cause any more trouble here. I'm gonna save and i'm gonna take off
[18769.22s -> 18771.22s]  Like from this place
[18786.01s -> 18788.73s]  Can you pick up the big animals not bears and everything
[18794.52s -> 18798.12s]  Yeah, i'm sorry for the for the next at least 30 minutes of this stream
[18799.56s -> 18802.76s]  I kind of have to do this though. This is the only opportunity i'm ever gonna have
[18803.40s -> 18807.51s]  I just dumped somebody's head
[18807.51s -> 18824.74s]  I heard somebody over here
[18824.74s -> 18842.26s]  Like turkeys these people are investigating. I was gonna go in there. Did you hear that?
[18842.82s -> 18847.64s]  Holy shit
[18847.64s -> 18849.78s]  You're lucky
[18849.78s -> 18859.83s]  You're lucky. We gotta move on from this stop
[18866.52s -> 18868.76s]  I do I do want to go. I do have to pick up a gun though. That's all right
[18869.56s -> 18873.02s]  Somebody's getting up
[18876.84s -> 18878.68s]  We're attracting
[18878.68s -> 18881.64s]  Like once you get on you're not allowed to get off

[18917.78s -> 18919.78s]  Bears are gonna come in here
[18919.78s -> 18925.06s]  Animals are gonna come over here. This is gonna be fucking so ridiculous if they stay here
[18926.41s -> 18931.29s]  I don't even need to go hunting. There's gonna be animals in here every single every five minutes
[18931.77s -> 18939.77s]  There's gonna be a bear will come in here
[18939.93s -> 18942.43s]  It's gonna be so many predators
[18944.14s -> 18946.46s]  I'm gonna get like eaten by a bear in the train
[18947.71s -> 18949.31s]  Mark my words
[18949.31s -> 18953.95s]  All right, we gotta get out of here one more guy down there and that's it. We're gonna move
[18957.92s -> 18963.36s]  Well, yeah, what happened in the old journal? You know the guy that used to run into people and laugh and scream
[18965.87s -> 18969.64s]  You sure you wanted that?
[18969.64s -> 18971.56s]  Be careful what you wish for
[18971.56s -> 18985.88s]  You know, you just might get it
[18987.20s -> 18989.20s]  More food for the fucking train
[18990.08s -> 19009.00s]  I'm about to see that guy knows it's that guy knows what's up. That guy doesn't have to become food
[19014.97s -> 19016.97s]  Well, maybe he does
[19017.13s -> 19023.37s]  Maybe he does
[19023.37s -> 19025.37s]  Wait, whose dog is this?
[19025.61s -> 19027.61s]  Why is there a dog in here?
[19027.61s -> 19029.61s]  Hey, what are you in here?
[19031.23s -> 19032.75s]  Get out of here
[19032.75s -> 19034.75s]  Technically, he's not in the train
[19034.83s -> 19037.36s]  He's not in the train yet
[19037.36s -> 19038.80s]  Get out of here
[19038.80s -> 19041.40s]  You need to get out of here
[19041.40s -> 19043.40s]  You need to don't step in this train
[19044.72s -> 19047.79s]  Out don't go in there
[19048.25s -> 19051.26s]  Don't go in there. I'm gonna tell you you're not gonna want to be in there
[19057.07s -> 19060.11s]  What the fuck? How did you get in? I don't perfect
[19060.83s -> 19063.44s]  I'm gonna pick him up
[19063.44s -> 19072.27s]  Get out of here. It's a oh, it's a fox
[19078.03s -> 19080.33s]  Well, what would happen?
[19083.23s -> 19084.67s]  That's everybody right?
[19084.67s -> 19085.71s]  Yep
[19085.71s -> 19087.24s]  Okay
[19087.24s -> 19103.88s]  Time to leave the station. Is the fox still there?
[19108.41s -> 19112.78s]  Hey get
[19112.78s -> 19129.69s]  Get excuse me. This is not gonna end well for you, man
[19134.38s -> 19137.64s]  Is he just gonna ride with me?
[19137.64s -> 19142.67s]  Okay
[19142.67s -> 19144.33s]  and so
[19144.33s -> 19147.63s]  The death train moves on to its next destination
[19148.25s -> 19154.08s]  He's not gonna fall off. I guess
[19154.16s -> 19156.06s]  He's just hanging out
[19156.06s -> 19162.84s]  I'm so concerned about him though
[19163.32s -> 19171.32s]  Well, is he gone?
[19171.32s -> 19173.32s]  Wait, wait, where is he? Where is he? Is he gone?
[19176.72s -> 19178.16s]  No, he's still there
[19178.16s -> 19183.80s]  Come to the next town
[19183.80s -> 19187.13s]  There's a witness investigating
[19189.34s -> 19192.04s]  Really? No
[19192.04s -> 19194.04s]  Where would that where would that be?
[19195.29s -> 19197.29s]  Save the game. Uh-huh
[19202.28s -> 19205.16s]  I can't
[19205.16s -> 19207.00s]  Here's the problem with this
[19207.00s -> 19210.52s]  I'll give you one issue
[19210.52s -> 19212.52s]  With a game save it doesn't matter
[19214.09s -> 19216.09s]  It's gonna put me leaning up against a tree somewhere
[19221.76s -> 19230.40s]  You all know it
[19230.56s -> 19232.56s]  Have I get followed by vultures?
[19268.01s -> 19271.72s]  You did you've survived that
[19271.72s -> 19273.48s]  Really?
[19273.48s -> 19281.66s]  Fucking bullshit
[19281.66s -> 19287.00s]  I gotta go
[19287.00s -> 19288.68s]  Mr. Fox
[19288.68s -> 19299.40s]  Full speed ahead. Oh the passenger is still in there
[19300.20s -> 19313.84s]  Why is this guy trying to keep up with me?
[19325.87s -> 19327.87s]  You cannot stop death
[19328.03s -> 19338.11s]  I can't feel the train here, man. It's too dangerous
[19338.99s -> 19342.52s]  I just gotta get out of here
[19342.52s -> 19348.49s]  Under the train right now. Why do I hear glass breaking?
[19349.29s -> 19352.30s]  There's so many police
[19352.70s -> 19357.56s]  They're just running into the train
[19358.12s -> 19360.12s]  They're sprinting into the train
[19360.84s -> 19362.84s]  They've lost all control
[19362.84s -> 19373.80s]  Holy shit
[19373.80s -> 19375.80s]  Oh my god
[19378.14s -> 19381.44s]  It calls to them
[19381.44s -> 19383.44s]  Almost all over the sky
[19385.26s -> 19387.26s]  And then we get up and just pick the blood
[19392.62s -> 19398.51s]  We've got a train to beat
[19398.51s -> 19401.07s]  Now they're freaking out. I'm now I just became a train
[19401.87s -> 19403.15s]  Nothing else
[19403.15s -> 19409.52s]  I don't have to move
[19409.52s -> 19412.86s]  I'm a train
[19412.86s -> 19415.88s]  Officer good evening
[19415.88s -> 19418.12s]  Whoa, hey

[19425.84s -> 19427.28s]  I can't go
[19427.28s -> 19429.12s]  I'm gonna die
[19429.12s -> 19430.64s]  I can't move
[19430.64s -> 19432.64s]  Oh, it's over. It's over
[19450.30s -> 19452.30s]  I didn't work this fucking hard to have this happen
[19464.67s -> 19466.03s]  Two trains
[19466.03s -> 19470.19s]  Two trains
[19470.19s -> 19472.35s]  I can't move this train won't move down
[19472.99s -> 19495.84s]  Here we go get the bodies. I I can't stick around there man. I gotta get out. I get a good way
[19497.12s -> 19500.96s]  There's a whole nother train of people over there. I'm just gonna transfer them to this one
[19502.08s -> 19537.36s]  You still there? Hey buddy. All right, how my core is doing?
[19537.92s -> 19543.37s]  I'm like running out of food
[19543.37s -> 19550.89s]  Can you hear the flies?
[19550.89s -> 19556.64s]  So yeah, we're just gonna transfer this is the transfer station
[19557.28s -> 19591.12s]  Are there people in here?
[19591.20s -> 19593.50s]  Come on
[19603.05s -> 19610.94s]  Okay, the conductor and put him in i'm gonna put him in the engine room
[19623.15s -> 19625.65s]  The fox just defended his territory
[19634.92s -> 19636.92s]  Reproducing
[19639.53s -> 19645.45s]  I'm gonna put him in the conductor seat with me. Can I even get him up there? I can't
[19651.66s -> 19653.96s]  Oh
[19655.00s -> 19657.72s]  He's defending I love the fact that this is his house now
[19658.44s -> 19661.48s]  A raccoon came over and he's like get out of here. This is my train
[19662.36s -> 19663.32s]  uh
[19663.32s -> 19671.18s]  I can study him again
[19671.18s -> 19673.26s]  Are there a bunch of passengers on here though for real?
[19678.75s -> 19681.63s]  That has to be right
[19681.63s -> 19683.63s]  Somebody would be taking the train
[19686.54s -> 19688.38s]  Is there nobody on here?
[19688.38s -> 19698.09s]  I don't think I can
[19698.09s -> 19733.02s]  What the hell is this guy doing here? He's guarding the train
[19734.24s -> 19736.14s]  well
[19736.14s -> 19739.66s]  Uh, sorry, I mean, I don't think you guard a train from the boiler room
[19760.64s -> 19762.64s]  Go get the engineer's hat
[19769.71s -> 19771.71s]  There there's another fox
[19774.11s -> 19776.11s]  He's died
[19776.11s -> 19781.23s]  He can't move his head is stuck. I gotta help him. How do I help him? How do I get him out of there?
[19782.03s -> 19784.25s]  Oh shit
[19784.25s -> 19787.71s]  Is he okay?
[19787.95s -> 19790.57s]  I think
[19790.57s -> 19794.48s]  Free him. I don't I don't know where he is. Which one is he under?
[19795.20s -> 19808.57s]  Oh, they're going through the train. They're going through the train now
[19809.21s -> 19814.81s]  Shit, I think that they're actually falling through the train when I pick him up like that
[19819.48s -> 19821.48s]  The corpses are just rotting out
[19821.56s -> 19830.48s]  I gotta be quick
[19830.48s -> 19836.09s]  Bodies decomposing
[19836.09s -> 19837.69s]  I I don't maybe not
[19837.69s -> 19843.77s]  I think it's because I picked him up and put him back down
[19844.09s -> 19848.38s]  All right. Hey, I need you to get out of the way
[19848.38s -> 19851.52s]  I gotta get to the front of the train
[19851.52s -> 19854.52s]  He's covered in blood. He's been eating them
[19856.32s -> 19857.60s]  Excuse me
[19857.60s -> 19866.28s]  Look at his face. Hold on. I got a perfect opportunity
[19867.24s -> 19869.24s]  For a fucking family photo
[19869.56s -> 19897.24s]  I can't okay. Here we go. I actually can't like get in a good spot because I can't crouch
[19898.04s -> 19900.04s]  I can't do handheld and crouched
[19900.44s -> 19902.44s]  That's bullshit. Why?
[19918.16s -> 19920.16s]  I can't really get the image that I want
[19935.76s -> 19943.80s]  That's so annoying I have to be like sloppily facing the right direction
[19944.68s -> 19953.52s]  He's inside inside the train
[19954.97s -> 19957.55s]  Is he though?
[19957.55s -> 19983.21s]  Oh, no, I don't make the rules. I can make an exception
[19984.52s -> 19988.14s]  Are we gonna move on to the next town? I guess I they're gonna start to despawn here
[19988.86s -> 19990.81s]  unless
[19990.81s -> 19992.81s]  No, there are no passengers on that
[19994.56s -> 19998.43s]  Let's go
[19998.43s -> 20011.95s]  We need fresh blood for a second. I thought I had the wrong train
[20012.67s -> 20021.26s]  A little bit settlement. It's not a major town
[20022.38s -> 20043.36s]  We're a bunch of animals. It's kind of fun
[20044.40s -> 20058.89s]  All right, you can cross
[20058.89s -> 20061.50s]  Found our place
[20061.50s -> 20063.50s]  Witness investigate
[20063.66s -> 20067.90s]  Are these are these lawyers? Are these if these are lawyers?
[20073.52s -> 20100.59s]  I got some more food for you
[20102.12s -> 20103.16s]  Hello
[20103.16s -> 20104.70s]  Watch out
[20104.70s -> 20109.82s]  Dinner's here
[20109.82s -> 20111.82s]  Don't you dare bite your dad?
[20117.04s -> 20139.98s]  Feed me Seymour. I don't like him being right here though. I feel like i'm gonna step on him. Okay, let's keep on
[20140.46s -> 20150.83s]  It might be time for a little bit of wildlife
[20150.91s -> 20156.60s]  Good spot for that though
[20157.00s -> 20159.00s]  Name the fox
[20159.00s -> 20160.20s]  Francis
[20160.20s -> 20178.62s]  Francis the fox
[20179.82s -> 20184.94s]  Why do you take another 10 to 15 people?
[20185.90s -> 20194.99s]  I i'm not gonna get out
[20196.35s -> 20200.83s]  Why there are like eight
[20201.23s -> 20211.76s]  Let's do it. I don't give a shit about the meat quality
[20212.48s -> 20231.66s]  Well, I hear something. I hear somebody running around
[20237.24s -> 20238.76s]  Oh, there's a house
[20238.76s -> 20246.20s]  What is this? I don't have time to like explore
[20258.09s -> 20265.52s]  One squirrel one squirrel and I don't I can't even drop them. I just put them in my pocket
[20276.86s -> 20278.78s]  Feed Francis i'm trying I just need
[20279.26s -> 20282.12s]  Well, here comes somebody
[20282.12s -> 20293.80s]  I think it's time to get some lawmen on me here. No tell on me
[20294.44s -> 20310.28s]  Bring it back to the train
[20310.28s -> 20312.28s]  That guy got up on me quick
[20312.76s -> 20317.37s]  Now don't drag him. Don't drag him
[20327.79s -> 20329.79s]  He's on a horse. Yeah, but
[20330.27s -> 20332.57s]  I don't think it's gonna be that fast
[20357.12s -> 20359.36s]  I'm not trying. Okay. Here we go. Here they come
[20366.51s -> 20370.75s]  Bring them on
[20370.75s -> 20401.36s]  All right, load them up. It's gonna take them forever to clean this train
[20405.20s -> 20416.84s]  Yes, it is. He's right there. Francis. He's fine
[20417.56s -> 20419.48s]  He just was saying hello
[20419.48s -> 20421.66s]  He was like, hey, how are you? How are you?
[20421.90s -> 20433.15s]  Are they still investigating?
[20433.15s -> 20434.59s]  Apparently not
[20434.59s -> 20440.03s]  Oh, they're coming from this direction now
[20441.44s -> 20443.44s]  Might have to put them down
[20445.31s -> 20447.31s]  I'd rather you come in here
[20447.39s -> 20470.76s]  Right next to the train. Perfect. I'm gonna start moving here
[20484.03s -> 20486.03s]  I need some poor refilling
[20486.51s -> 20500.46s]  Usually tame the fox. That's pretty cool. Actually this guy's falling out
[20501.72s -> 20503.32s]  re
[20503.32s -> 20505.94s]  Recalibrate this dude
[20516.62s -> 20519.26s]  You know some people speed run video games
[20520.14s -> 20523.28s]  Do it as fast as possible
[20523.36s -> 20524.88s]  some people
[20524.88s -> 20527.12s]  Spend a lot of time getting really good and get competitive
[20529.55s -> 20534.91s]  Some people are you know personalities and they don't look at all the things that they say and all the funny things that they do
[20536.60s -> 20539.64s]  I feel trained with bodies until my playstation crashes
[20542.68s -> 20544.68s]  Kind of coming to these terms here
[20551.74s -> 20556.96s]  More oh and they're fresh too a lot of people
[20557.36s -> 20564.14s]  Be careful. Oh shit
[20564.78s -> 20608.03s]  Still here. All right. Let me do some just general maintenance here
[20608.59s -> 20627.26s]  How's it doing clean it up? Come on. Hurry up
[20627.90s -> 20639.52s]  Well here the real kicker here is to try to see if this works
[20640.64s -> 20642.36s]  is
[20642.36s -> 20643.40s]  it's
[20643.40s -> 20648.36s]  Then you might not be able to have more than like 50 to 30 to 50 or something bodies on the screen at the same time
[20649.32s -> 20651.72s]  And it'll be a thing where they just actually despawn
[20652.76s -> 20654.76s]  But i'm willing to give it a try
[20655.32s -> 20675.95s]  Right here the game is starting to hate this
[20677.15s -> 20681.87s]  But what point will they turn us off? You know what I mean? At what point does it not do I not get to do it anymore?
[20684.14s -> 20686.62s]  When is the game actually sick of my shit completely?
[20688.09s -> 20693.90s]  That's the real question. I think that's it. No, there's one more down here
[20707.72s -> 20710.52s]  Save the game save saving the game is not going to do anything
[20711.24s -> 20713.68s]  Because when you save a game
[20714.00s -> 20716.64s]  It just when you load that save it puts you
[20717.44s -> 20719.44s]  Oh, like you just woke up at a camp
[20720.38s -> 20725.26s]  Nearby it doesn't it's not like a state that you're saving. It's the time that you're saving
[20726.62s -> 20728.62s]  Oh, it's starting to hang
[20731.60s -> 20732.96s]  Starting to hang
[20732.96s -> 20741.39s]  That's how you know, we're getting there
[20741.39s -> 20744.78s]  Hey little boy all aboard. Let's go
[20751.36s -> 20754.00s]  What was the point of this again, uh to try to crash the game?
[20754.56s -> 20758.14s]  Or to see how many people I can fit in the train
[20759.79s -> 20770.89s]  Be either one we're about to make it to micah
[20771.77s -> 20773.29s]  people
[20773.29s -> 20776.04s]  Anybody in there?
[20776.04s -> 20780.97s]  I don't think so. I don't see anybody in there
[20780.97s -> 20793.15s]  I'm not even an animal, but you have to hunt the animals like the people come to you
[20794.51s -> 20808.83s]  This is actually pretty cool
[20808.83s -> 20810.59s]  This looks great
[20810.59s -> 20827.61s]  Ass on the mini back. Yeah, i'm being followed right now by even the monster
[20828.81s -> 20838.16s]  I just think i'm gonna gas
[20852.08s -> 20856.00s]  Gas well, you know what I mean. I mean like can this thing burn out all the coal
[20857.12s -> 20860.44s]  It's up throwing bodies in there
[20860.68s -> 20867.48s]  Where are we at now?
[20867.48s -> 20870.75s]  This looks like animal territory
[20871.15s -> 20874.35s]  I think it's time to put in some animals
[20879.96s -> 20886.59s]  How far north are we right now? We're okay. We're about to reach back around here to forward
[20893.92s -> 20896.48s]  I guess
[20896.48s -> 20898.48s]  We'll see where it takes us
[20898.64s -> 20910.32s]  Try putting bait in the body room. Well, aren't they already just it's a bunch of bait there already
[20911.68s -> 20926.40s]  We're taking the scenic route
[20926.72s -> 20930.44s]  I don't see any exes gone. I don't think they they're decomposing
[20931.40s -> 20933.40s]  What I can tell you is I can't tell you
[20934.60s -> 20936.60s]  This is the same as it did before
[20937.72s -> 20947.47s]  I wonder if there's a finite actually a lot of time
[20948.67s -> 20953.21s]  30 minutes 20 minutes an hour
[20955.53s -> 20958.33s]  Why not they might just be an entity that's like an asset that's there forever
[20960.49s -> 20964.41s]  I would assume when you move 100 yards 200 yards that way
[20965.29s -> 20969.63s]  And that would be
[20983.44s -> 20985.76s]  What's the joke I don't have a plan here
[20986.72s -> 20989.92s]  The plan is just fill it
[20990.00s -> 20993.13s]  Until it doesn't fill me
[20993.13s -> 20997.68s]  I don't have another that's that's it
[20998.32s -> 21007.52s]  I mean
[21007.52s -> 21009.76s]  I'm imagining a scenario
[21010.16s -> 21012.46s]  Where they never do some
[21013.64s -> 21015.95s]  And it is just
[21016.03s -> 21018.67s]  Stuffed with bodies on top of each other
[21019.31s -> 21028.59s]  Have to come to another town
[21029.15s -> 21037.85s]  Here's the stop let's see if anybody's here
[21038.57s -> 21046.75s]  It's a little late. I think
[21046.75s -> 21048.75s]  I don't think anybody is here
[21052.48s -> 21054.00s]  On we go
[21054.00s -> 21064.36s]  Don't fall off this
[21064.36s -> 21070.30s]  Box is still there hanging up
[21070.30s -> 21072.30s]  Here comes the fort i'm gonna get a lot of bodies here
[21073.10s -> 21091.45s]  harvesting
[21091.45s -> 21093.45s]  Yeah, pretty much
[21098.91s -> 21102.14s]  All right camp
[21102.14s -> 21103.90s]  I could probably get
[21103.90s -> 21108.62s]  Is there anybody at that camp?
[21111.34s -> 21113.42s]  Because I could just dump them over the edge and pick them up later
[21114.14s -> 21123.60s]  I mean there's a horse there
[21123.60s -> 21125.12s]  No, i'm not worth it
[21125.12s -> 21131.08s]  Not enough
[21131.08s -> 21133.24s]  This was Thanos's original plan
[21134.12s -> 21146.49s]  Uh, this is absolutely gorgeous though
[21147.21s -> 21150.01s]  I've been driving through so many beautiful things that I feel like i'm about to take me in
[21166.11s -> 21167.87s]  Still not really
[21167.87s -> 21169.71s]  I mean
[21169.71s -> 21171.71s]  Wallace station is up here
[21172.35s -> 21177.87s]  We'll probably get 10 to 20 more bodies at Wallace station
[21189.55s -> 21192.27s]  By the way, I I am so committed to this at the moment that
[21193.23s -> 21195.71s]  I i'm not going to stop this stream
[21197.07s -> 21199.31s]  Until it's satisfying
[21200.67s -> 21202.67s]  You understand
[21217.40s -> 21219.64s]  If you put if it's been this long already
[21220.52s -> 21223.42s]  You have to see it through
[21223.42s -> 21227.80s]  Could I right now be like oh it's kind of interesting. Oh, well
[21229.32s -> 21231.08s]  Yeah, it doesn't move on
[21231.08s -> 21232.12s]  No
[21232.12s -> 21233.24s]  What?
[21233.24s -> 21237.56s]  It's been like an hour and 30 minutes of doing this at least
[21238.28s -> 21246.09s]  What's the end game for Francis? I don't know
[21246.81s -> 21250.70s]  He's currently my
[21250.70s -> 21253.66s]  My co-conductor right now. I don't want him in that
[21260.91s -> 21262.91s]  Coming up on the town
[21266.96s -> 21269.90s]  Let's see if we can't pull a few more people
[21270.70s -> 21273.32s]  Actually, i'm gonna go all the way around with my horse
[21277.44s -> 21279.44s]  cp 985
[21279.92s -> 21282.16s]  The never-ending train
[21287.00s -> 21289.24s]  Can you actually befriend the fox? I don't think you can
[21290.04s -> 21296.06s]  Does anybody know how many people are actually on the train right now?
[21298.80s -> 21300.80s]  And I would say
[21300.88s -> 21302.46s]  20
[21302.46s -> 21304.22s]  15 25
[21304.22s -> 21316.51s]  No, just one just one
[21317.90s -> 21321.32s]  counting the fox
[21321.32s -> 21323.95s]  No, i'm not counting the fuck
[21323.95s -> 21325.95s]  It's probably like I bet you there's like 16 people
[21326.43s -> 21337.77s]  All right, let's roll in
[21337.77s -> 21339.37s]  rolling in
[21339.37s -> 21341.39s]  to
[21341.39s -> 21343.82s]  Wallace station
[21343.82s -> 21345.82s]  Please watch the doors on the left
[21346.67s -> 21348.19s]  entering
[21348.19s -> 21352.04s]  Wallace station
[21352.04s -> 21370.41s]  Check for your belongings
[21370.41s -> 21374.01s]  So I think it has been confirmed. I think part of that long
[21374.57s -> 21376.57s]  Journey there in between bodies going in
[21378.36s -> 21382.92s]  Uh, I think I believe that they're not going to these ones because they probably would have already
[21418.20s -> 21420.92s]  Oh, I can't pick him up. He's too big for me to pick up
[21423.26s -> 21425.10s]  Is he too big?
[21425.10s -> 21449.21s]  Shit, he's too big. Oh, well the train will eat it one way or another. That's true
[21449.85s -> 21463.16s]  I really don't
[21463.16s -> 21465.16s]  Whoa. Hey, hey
[21465.16s -> 21467.16s]  Looks like he's coming anyways
[21467.88s -> 21469.79s]  the train
[21469.79s -> 21472.14s]  Will take him
[21472.14s -> 21476.68s]  He's in
[21479.48s -> 21481.48s]  And welcome
[21481.80s -> 21486.88s]  To our next stop
[21486.88s -> 21488.08s]  Howdy
[21488.08s -> 21491.58s]  You're waiting for the train
[21492.22s -> 21494.70s]  Unfortunately, you picked the wrong train to get ready for
[21495.74s -> 21507.44s]  Have a nice day
[21507.44s -> 21510.16s]  Oh, yeah, come on man down here
[21510.72s -> 21519.02s]  Excuse me, francis
[21519.02s -> 21529.36s]  Excuse me
[21529.84s -> 21532.73s]  Fucking hell
[21532.73s -> 21535.29s]  There they come. All right. What do I got for cores? Am I good?
[21536.01s -> 21550.57s]  Can you use a little bit more did I i'm gonna have to craft some meat or something man
[21551.13s -> 21566.28s]  It's like all I got
[21566.28s -> 21581.66s]  Now we wait. No, I already I have meat. You're right. Come on in. Uh, oh, that's not a good sign
[21582.14s -> 21586.81s]  Where the law man? Let's go
[21586.81s -> 21594.44s]  I'm waiting for you. I'm here from the west
[21602.19s -> 21610.00s]  All right. Here they come. Let us will you use the cover?
[21610.80s -> 21623.93s]  three of them
[21623.93s -> 21625.69s]  more now
[21625.69s -> 21647.96s]  Nine feet. Let's go
[21647.96s -> 21650.04s]  Ah got coming in too hot
[21663.00s -> 21665.00s]  Just bulky ass elk in the way
[21665.56s -> 21668.70s]  I don't think I can go up this way anymore
[21669.61s -> 21672.41s]  No, I can't he's he's blocking that entrance
[21673.13s -> 21682.30s]  Take the lady's hat
[21682.30s -> 21689.96s]  You got it. I don't want to step on you. You need to be in a better splay. Yeah, get out of the way
[21691.08s -> 21694.16s]  I don't want to step on him
[21694.16s -> 21698.46s]  francis
[21698.46s -> 21701.18s]  All right. It's getting to a point where I can't walk through here
[21701.90s -> 21707.64s]  I can't i'm getting stuck. It's getting to the point where I can't stay in here
[21720.44s -> 21722.44s]  I gotta go through the back
[21741.37s -> 21744.12s]  I gotta go from the other side of the train
[21744.12s -> 21756.75s]  I won't be able to go in there anymore. Can I even get up from the other side? Are there stairs back here?
[21758.03s -> 21775.08s]  I think so
[21775.08s -> 21795.05s]  One two three make a count here. I got four more to put in
[21801.12s -> 21804.08s]  We actually have to keep track at this point because they might start despawning
[21804.96s -> 21811.16s]  There's definitely more than three
[21816.54s -> 21817.82s]  francis
[21817.82s -> 21819.34s]  I
[21819.34s -> 21854.67s]  Last guy there's so many people here
[21858.35s -> 21859.87s]  There's too many
[21859.87s -> 21893.47s]  Are there less x's? Oh no
[21894.73s -> 21903.29s]  They're despawning
[21903.29s -> 21906.16s]  No
[21906.16s -> 21911.21s]  So I here's what happened. Do you guys want to know the sad thing that happened here?
[21912.92s -> 21920.89s]  So the game because these are still actual npcs, right? What happened was
[21922.04s -> 21925.08s]  And I knew it was worth testing. We're trying to find out
[21926.28s -> 21927.40s]  it
[21927.40s -> 21930.12s]  There's only a certain amount of npcs that are like allowed
[21932.17s -> 21933.71s]  right
[21933.71s -> 21937.55s]  So once it gets to the point where there's too many npcs on the screen
[21938.11s -> 21946.27s]  It starts to remove them
[21946.27s -> 21948.91s]  Because it needs to make room for the other npcs that i'm calling in
[21951.23s -> 21953.39s]  But that doesn't mean we're not gonna have fun with the people that are here
[21953.71s -> 21956.51s]  So just let me get them in the right spot. I'm gonna put them all in the same spot
[21956.51s -> 21958.51s]  I'm gonna put dynamite down there
[21968.67s -> 21970.67s]  We're hitting the entity limit here
[21979.37s -> 21981.05s]  Oh, that's the joke
[21981.05s -> 21983.61s]  Well, the joke was I wonder how many people I can fit on the train
[21984.49s -> 21986.49s]  And I don't even know if it was necessarily a joke
[21989.26s -> 21992.57s]  Just wanted to see what would happen felt like doing it
[22002.94s -> 22003.98s]  so
[22003.98s -> 22005.74s]  Let's get them all
[22005.82s -> 22027.45s]  In one spot here
[22027.45s -> 22060.09s]  That's fine
[22060.09s -> 22071.56s]  Try putting them in a seat. I don't I really wonder what's gonna happen here though
[22072.12s -> 22087.23s]  There are quite a few people on here
[22087.63s -> 22102.72s]  I think it'll crash here
[22102.80s -> 22108.33s]  What the fuck somebody just sprinted by the right side of the screen. Was that my shadow? I don't even know
[22108.41s -> 22113.71s]  Oh god, they're starting to move. It's starting to become too much. They're starting to be mailed into one person
[22115.05s -> 22117.29s]  Oh boy
[22117.29s -> 22128.19s]  Okay, hurry up. Come on. Somebody's still alive down there. What the fuck
[22131.34s -> 22136.14s]  Jesus
[22139.85s -> 22143.53s]  This is this is demonic this is somebody said this is
[22144.57s -> 22146.57s]  That guy came from the ceiling
[22157.82s -> 22171.58s]  No, wrong way. It's almost like i'm pulling them from underneath
[22173.15s -> 22175.15s]  Oh, that guy is stretchy
[22175.23s -> 22179.82s]  You can always tell when they start to get all stretchy. This is now here comes the problem
[22180.46s -> 22205.04s]  I'm right here somewhere right here. It's quite the bear bait
[22208.06s -> 22214.89s]  Not yet, i'm gonna make sure they're right in the right pile because a couple of them are not in the boy
[22220.00s -> 22222.00s]  This is demonic
[22222.40s -> 22225.39s]  This is demonic
[22225.39s -> 22226.99s]  Okay. All right
[22226.99s -> 22230.35s]  There's only like one more person over here. I think
[22233.10s -> 22235.31s]  francis
[22235.31s -> 22237.37s]  Stay back
[22237.37s -> 22240.09s]  Where's this last one? I think this one on top of the train
[22250.44s -> 22258.32s]  Jesus
[22258.32s -> 22260.96s]  That guy's stuffed under upside down
[22266.54s -> 22268.54s]  All right, this is no this guy right here
[22273.13s -> 22279.74s]  Here we go
[22279.74s -> 22304.22s]  I don't even have I don't even have dynamite. They're despawning. Oh, shh. No, don't burn
[22304.78s -> 22305.66s]  No
[22305.66s -> 22346.08s]  Hey whisper
[22346.08s -> 22353.76s]  You didn't even have anything on you. Did you?
[22353.76s -> 22355.76s]  Don't worry. It was only a nightmare
[22359.18s -> 22360.54s]  Oh, all right
[22360.54s -> 22368.12s]  So what um, what the hell were we doing? All right, I was gonna reload the game
[22375.13s -> 22382.24s]  Damn, I wish I had died just didn't realize I didn't have dynamite. That was unfortunate
[22382.80s -> 22385.21s]  Was that worth it?
[22385.21s -> 22387.21s]  Let me kind of to see if it was possible
[22395.28s -> 22397.84s]  All right. So this is 2250. That's the autosave
[22398.70s -> 22400.70s]  21 41
[22400.96s -> 22413.16s]  I think this is it right?
[22413.16s -> 22415.71s]  You knew the rule
[22415.71s -> 22420.16s]  You were on the train
[22420.16s -> 22422.40s]  Yeah, so this is uh, this is the one
[22424.83s -> 22432.94s]  That was some pretty good stalling. You can hear the depression in his voice. You can I like really
[22433.50s -> 22435.50s]  I at least wanted to do dynamite there
[22435.82s -> 22437.80s]  I guess
[22437.80s -> 22440.36s]  That's my own fault for not looking through my inventory first
[22454.46s -> 22460.06s]  I demand a one. No, that was like almost and that was two hours. No, that wasn't that long
[22460.46s -> 22477.55s]  Let's redo it on pc when the body count gets to be higher
[22478.75s -> 22485.60s]  Do I have any soup left? No, that's gone. I was gone a while ago
[22486.48s -> 22488.48s]  That's before the first body went on the train
[22491.45s -> 22494.33s]  That was a third of your stream. I just joined at four hours when you started
[22499.14s -> 22502.96s]  225 bounty
[22502.96s -> 22512.12s]  What wrong save that's okay. So which one is it then this one?
[22513.84s -> 22518.56s]  The course of true love 36, but why would I get why did the tenth of a percent come from
[22521.74s -> 22525.74s]  It's one of these two. Uh, this is okay. I manually saved so it's 21 29
[22528.73s -> 22531.37s]  So it was one of these two. I guess it could just be this one
[22537.47s -> 22554.04s]  Yeah, I blame the oak
[22554.04s -> 22555.96s]  Well, thanks for um
[22555.96s -> 22557.96s]  Thanks for taking that journey with me everybody
[22558.60s -> 22560.92s]  Sorry, it didn't uh end the way that we all wanted but
[22569.24s -> 22571.24s]  It was worth it. It was worth taking the trip
[22572.35s -> 22580.03s]  I think
[22580.67s -> 22589.95s]  It was a fitting rp ending
[22590.67s -> 22592.67s]  ritual suicide
[22594.12s -> 22595.08s]  God
[22595.08s -> 22597.08s]  So where the hell am I now?
[22598.51s -> 22600.25s]  so
[22600.25s -> 22601.93s]  this was
[22601.93s -> 22603.93s]  What how much money do I got 14 13?
[22604.33s -> 22606.33s]  45 bounty sounds about right
[22606.57s -> 22613.85s]  You ain't scaring nobody. Oh, this is where the try. I this is where I I thought so long ago
[22613.85s -> 22616.41s]  I forgot I forgot about the train going back and forth a bit
[22619.32s -> 22621.32s]  This is where it all began. You're right
[22621.56s -> 22623.66s]  all right, um
[22623.66s -> 22629.10s]  Let me I need to go back to town the thing that I was supposed to do a long time ago
[22629.82s -> 22642.56s]  Look out god. It's I i've played the game in like two hours
[22644.33s -> 22648.33s]  I'm like trying to think about putting these people on on the train. That's like all I know
[22649.13s -> 22651.13s]  Where the hell is he is he in the stable?
[22651.61s -> 22662.43s]  You ever let this horse feed
[22662.67s -> 22665.39s]  I got space for you. Oh, let's bring out sonic
[22670.22s -> 22673.58s]  Yeah, let's give it a a good a good package. Absolutely
[22674.22s -> 22680.76s]  good decision
[22680.76s -> 22685.08s]  The autoslave side already contains the course of do you want to override? Yes, I do
[22693.20s -> 22697.76s]  Let's do this mission and then we'll see where we're at. It's been about six and a half hours so far
[22699.60s -> 22701.76s]  Let's see where we're at at the end of this mission here
[22703.64s -> 22706.20s]  Rename the horse to francis. No, I have to go get a new francis
[22707.00s -> 22715.68s]  You know what i'm saying? I'm not just I I can't just rename this guy. I have to tame a new horse name of francis
[22716.40s -> 22728.11s]  How many horses are you allowed to have at the moment? I can have four
[22729.88s -> 22732.49s]  Four total
[22732.49s -> 22755.55s]  That might increase later. I don't know random encounter. Well, I guess a snake bite
[22772.44s -> 22774.44s]  You good
[22781.53s -> 22783.53s]  Just tried that plan over there
[22784.33s -> 22786.33s]  He was like a gunshot
[22789.37s -> 22791.61s]  oh
[22791.77s -> 22793.87s]  From the one with the paint flowers
[22794.91s -> 22796.91s]  tiny little bastard
[22797.31s -> 22798.67s]  steer clear
[22798.67s -> 22800.67s]  Thanks, mister
[22800.83s -> 22807.29s]  I owe you my life some things you learn the hard way. Yeah
[22808.09s -> 22809.37s]  You can
[22809.37s -> 22811.37s]  You can say that again
[22811.69s -> 22821.88s]  Only the sage is a poisonous herb use it in the crafting to apply poison to weapons like throwing knives and arrows
[22832.41s -> 22859.36s]  Menus
[22860.32s -> 22863.46s]  Vomit ability unlocked well, I can craft poison
[22876.51s -> 22878.51s]  Ah too bad
[22878.83s -> 22880.83s]  I was thinking I was gonna puke off the horse
[22881.31s -> 22893.34s]  I'm not gonna feed it to the horse. What are you talking about?
[22893.98s -> 22896.92s]  gonna be evil
[22896.92s -> 22898.76s]  Why the poison?
[22898.76s -> 22900.68s]  I don't need poison for anything right now
[22910.09s -> 22922.57s]  Feed it to somebody else's horse. I don't think i'm going to do that
[22924.35s -> 22926.83s]  Well, I don't know why you guys want me to poison somebody's horse
[22934.08s -> 22937.68s]  Killed 50 people and put them on a train and you're worried about being evil
[22939.58s -> 22942.22s]  That I didn't do that the fucking monsters in my head did
[22943.48s -> 22945.72s]  The demon possessing me made me do that. I didn't do that
[22946.68s -> 22951.29s]  Although there is let's see what this is
[22960.30s -> 22962.30s]  The demon possessing me made me do it
[22964.46s -> 22972.96s]  What what are you talking? What i'm in like a cut scene with this guy why?
[22980.27s -> 22982.09s]  uh
[22982.09s -> 22984.17s]  They won't leave him alone. I can't stop this
[22992.04s -> 22994.04s]  I'm not holding down l2
[22995.47s -> 22997.47s]  It's trying to go into a cut scene with him
[23012.70s -> 23014.70s]  That train sound is like
[23015.02s -> 23016.54s]  Kind of freaking me out
[23016.54s -> 23021.64s]  It's back
[23021.64s -> 23023.16s]  It's back
[23023.16s -> 23028.09s]  What if I get it? Can I get it on the horse?
[23032.22s -> 23042.14s]  I can't escape this guy
[23048.60s -> 23050.68s]  Yeah, i'm permanently locked onto this guy
[23051.92s -> 23054.17s]  from any angle
[23054.17s -> 23056.97s]  I have to kill him. No. No, I need to see how this plays out
[23057.77s -> 23059.21s]  I can't kill him
[23059.21s -> 23072.35s]  I want him to get on a horse
[23072.35s -> 23079.26s]  I can't get on the horse
[23081.04s -> 23082.80s]  Like and here's the train
[23082.80s -> 23086.89s]  The train calls to me. It's calling me
[23091.44s -> 23123.10s]  I gotta find a cliff to jump off. I gotta somehow find a cliff to jump off of
[23132.75s -> 23134.83s]  Get me to i'm gonna go on the top of a mountain
[23135.23s -> 23137.63s]  Oh, wait, no, i'm still am i'm i'm locked
[23138.59s -> 23151.07s]  No, the jump canceled it. No, I think I got just too far away
[23151.71s -> 23154.52s]  He he probably despawned
[23154.52s -> 23157.08s]  He probably de-spawned unfortunately for us
[23157.96s -> 23163.55s]  Come on, here we go
[23163.55s -> 23186.30s]  The train commands it. No, I can't never mind. All right onto this we'll do this last mission
[23186.70s -> 23188.70s]  And then we'll call it night because it is getting late
[23195.74s -> 23198.78s]  I just want a backhanded hammer fist to punch somebody in the face
[23203.95s -> 23206.19s]  Just like burn
[23206.35s -> 23220.25s]  You think all this lemon air is free
[23222.09s -> 23226.01s]  Oh, that's a you're done that was a that was a guy that was
[23241.64s -> 23257.87s]  Horse, hey
[23257.87s -> 23263.04s]  Did I tell you guys that I can't whistle when I was younger?
[23264.16s -> 23266.16s]  uh my parents we had a dog and
[23267.28s -> 23270.67s]  You know my parents house
[23271.71s -> 23274.83s]  Hold on francis
[23276.08s -> 23280.86s]  Yep
[23280.86s -> 23286.78s]  francis
[23286.78s -> 23287.98s]  No
[23288.06s -> 23290.81s]  I think it was somebody else's dog
[23290.89s -> 23292.60s]  uh, but
[23292.60s -> 23294.60s]  so I don't know how to whistle like
[23299.48s -> 23310.16s]  I could do it for like a tenth of a second like so I used when you called your dog, you know, like oh like
[23311.04s -> 23312.32s]  Come here
[23312.32s -> 23314.32s]  I would go who who?

[23337.85s -> 23348.35s]  well
[23348.35s -> 23350.97s]  but I I
[23350.97s -> 23353.60s]  I
[23353.68s -> 23361.79s]  I seriously used to say who who to call my dog. I just don't know how to whistle
[23378.78s -> 23386.54s]  What why what are we angry at up here? Oh bounty hunters
[23388.54s -> 23390.54s]  Come on. Yeah bounty hunters
[23391.95s -> 23403.08s]  bounty hunters

[23406.44s -> 23435.40s]  He hasn't been the same since the train i'm telling you I know
[23436.64s -> 23440.32s]  That's why you I just can't go off the rails in these games because then it's all I know

[23465.69s -> 23469.13s]  It's arthur. I thought it was a welcome back arthur. That was a random encounter
[23469.93s -> 23476.72s]  Now that was a funny voice
[23476.72s -> 23479.68s]  Well, yeah, you know funny voices is what I do on this channel
[23480.64s -> 23485.40s]  Oh
[23489.55s -> 23496.96s]  Funny voices i'm gonna put that in my twitter bio
[23498.49s -> 23500.81s]  Funny voices look at all the stuff we have
[23513.69s -> 23515.37s]  online media
[23515.37s -> 23522.33s]  Thank you. Thank you
[23522.49s -> 23525.87s]  So let me donate this stuff and take my cut
[23526.51s -> 23541.69s]  Do a funny homer bart simpson voice
[23542.33s -> 23548.99s]  I don't have I don't I don't know how to do that. All right, what's my cut? I got diamonds here, man
[23549.63s -> 23553.72s]  Where's the diamonds?
[23553.72s -> 23562.16s]  Did I sell them already?
[23562.16s -> 23567.88s]  There's nothing I didn't buy
[23567.88s -> 23581.58s]  Let's eat some food. What do you say?
[23592.62s -> 23594.38s]  cooked flaky fish
[23594.38s -> 23601.90s]  Do a spee voice the spee i'm not doing the spee voice guys
[23602.86s -> 23604.30s]  i'm sorry
[23604.30s -> 23608.25s]  This is the final mission of the night
[23608.33s -> 23610.41s]  and then
[23610.41s -> 23613.77s]  You may you got a lot on you may see me tomorrow as well
[23615.88s -> 23617.88s]  But there's a couple things I need to do
[23617.88s -> 23619.88s]  I might just I might take a break from red dead
[23620.76s -> 23622.76s]  We'll try something else tonight
[23629.02s -> 23631.98s]  Oh, we might lead into this or we'll see I don't know colored foe
[23632.38s -> 23637.50s]  They said there's a gang of fools holed up in the swamps east. I might just play this again. I don't know never ended
[23638.14s -> 23642.70s]  I might not stream tomorrow. I don't know raising in these fools minds 30 years later
[23643.58s -> 23644.94s]  That ain't my point
[23644.94s -> 23647.50s]  These ignorant fools are weapon dealers
[23648.14s -> 23652.06s]  And in their dealings sometimes sit on a decent pile of cash. Oh, no, no
[23652.14s -> 23655.42s]  I've been selling weapons to cuba and south america for years
[23655.74s -> 23661.58s]  I'm I'm absolutely not the old boy. I was talking to reckon there might be a bunch of cash just sitting around
[23662.06s -> 23663.66s]  and failing that
[23663.66s -> 23668.62s]  Maybe a nice stash of weapons with just a bunch of crazies gardening. Exactly. Well
[23671.24s -> 23676.76s]  Worth taking a look at least isn't it? That was my thinking said it was at some place called shady bear
[23677.00s -> 23679.00s]  Why does everybody want me to do this? Okay
[23680.84s -> 23682.12s]  I just go
[23682.12s -> 23688.68s]  Shmeek like that's it. That's that was like the comedy routine like four years ago. I was hoping you'd be in
[23689.16s -> 23691.16s]  If that's how they told it
[23698.30s -> 23732.96s]  He did it he did it this way all right, let's take off remember that one
[23735.52s -> 23737.52s]  Remember I did that four years ago
[23740.67s -> 23748.65s]  Well, that's not how I'm I think some of them harangued me and saty when we were coming back with supplies
[23749.37s -> 23751.37s]  Mrs. Apple star wars team
[23771.69s -> 23776.01s]  It seems like it is these boys got a manner about
[23776.73s -> 23782.33s]  But I haven't necessarily noticed all respect mr. Morgan you wouldn't notice
[23783.29s -> 23786.65s]  Might call you a nigger lover. They see us riding like this
[23787.61s -> 23791.53s]  But most of it is uh, my dog is a glance or a word
[23792.33s -> 23795.05s]  And after that you can't whistle but you can do that. No, I can't
[23796.33s -> 23799.29s]  Out west is out. I cannot is out west
[23800.09s -> 23802.09s]  And you're all who you are
[23802.96s -> 23804.56s]  decent folks
[23804.72s -> 23808.19s]  Some places down here they judge different
[23810.54s -> 23812.86s]  Yes, it can't be so easy for you Lenny
[23814.19s -> 23816.19s]  Sorry, you're caught up in this
[23816.27s -> 23822.35s]  Well, we demand more. I guess their gold still shines. Oh, there's no more and their guns still shooting
[23822.75s -> 23828.27s]  I just played a sound clip by I queued it up and I played it and every one of these bastards for all they got
[23828.59s -> 23831.20s]  Okay
[23831.20s -> 23835.68s]  Plus it beats being lynched back in black water with all of you by my side
[23836.40s -> 23838.40s]  I guess it does
[23839.68s -> 23841.68s]  More voices needed
[23852.91s -> 23858.03s]  Feels like we're close. It's a rundown old plantation house down in the bayou somewhere
[23858.83s -> 23861.07s]  Let's take it slow because
[23862.27s -> 23865.07s]  If like you say makes up for no whistle sitting on weapons
[23867.07s -> 23872.83s]  It's called sitting here just playing a video game of course and just doing that
[23873.79s -> 23878.83s]  They say it fine back before streaming and youtube and everything guys I used to sit here and do the same shit I do now
[23879.63s -> 23881.63s]  I can see the recto
[23887.87s -> 23891.31s]  See that church up ahead they're supposed to use it as an outpost
[23891.95s -> 23894.11s]  Just I was considering like making noises
[23895.31s -> 23904.27s]  Okay
[23905.44s -> 23907.44s]  I was always watching
[23908.68s -> 23912.19s]  Imagine getting caught up in a fight like yeah
[23912.67s -> 23914.59s]  I was already here
[23914.59s -> 23917.87s]  Well old content. I've already seen this. I already took the stuff from here
[23921.85s -> 23926.41s]  Hitman 2 comes out in three days. Look around there's so much out coming out
[23928.46s -> 23931.82s]  It doesn't look like anyone's here. We don't know that for sure
[23933.10s -> 23935.10s]  Let's have us a nosy
[23937.28s -> 23938.56s]  Hear that
[23938.56s -> 23943.79s]  Someone's on the track. I was already here. I came here too early
[23951.56s -> 23954.12s]  Look there a wagon. Let's see where

[23967.82s -> 23969.82s]  Hey ellen war
[23970.86s -> 23976.76s]  He could turn off at any time should we move up on him? Yeah
[23982.78s -> 23984.22s]  Did I lose?
[23984.22s -> 23988.76s]  I think I lost
[23989.56s -> 23992.32s]  Between the tree
[23992.32s -> 23995.39s]  I know this place
[23995.39s -> 23997.55s]  Okay, springfield rifle without the scope on it
[23997.55s -> 24006.30s]  You're real tough. Hey, it's getting late big plantation house must be shady bear
[24007.18s -> 24009.50s]  It is getting late up there off the trail
[24010.46s -> 24016.46s]  Once it gets to be above midnight 12 12 30 eastern time. It's time to call it a night. Come on
[24017.26s -> 24021.69s]  We can get a view on them from that wall up there. Make sure you bring the sharp shooter
[24022.41s -> 24024.41s]  I got it
[24027.55s -> 24030.81s]  I can't see
[24030.81s -> 24032.65s]  Oh now I can't
[24032.65s -> 24034.57s]  Maybe I should have the other rifle then
[24034.57s -> 24041.02s]  No, this thing's fine. Do you see anything? Yes
[24042.40s -> 24045.02s]  Yes
[24047.58s -> 24050.54s]  Is my internal clock adjusted almost a militia
[24051.77s -> 24053.77s]  Uh, it is at this point. Yeah
[24054.01s -> 24056.51s]  It's been pretty good. You got men covering the house
[24063.12s -> 24067.68s]  Gatling gun up there too. Well, they got that house locked down real tight
[24068.24s -> 24072.35s]  You got men everywhere off near the porch
[24073.76s -> 24088.81s]  Hey, you might want to look over to the right. I haven't seen anything worth shooting the stealer
[24090.52s -> 24094.44s]  I know. I know. I just wanted to see if I could see him. All right some tans
[24113.87s -> 24121.77s]  Or you could go down there acting friendly with these folks just draw them into one spot
[24122.57s -> 24129.63s]  I'll start shooting might be the dumbest idea i've ever heard but hey i'm always up for a performance
[24130.59s -> 24132.59s]  Well the tuba desk are done
[24136.25s -> 24141.82s]  Who's shooting?
[24141.82s -> 24143.66s]  What the fuck is going on?
[24143.66s -> 24150.06s]  Okay, lenny, uh
[24151.07s -> 24153.07s]  The dynamite's more fun
[24158.12s -> 24206.80s]  Lenny don't blow up got him. Hold on. Don't do anything yet. He's gonna get charged again
[24208.00s -> 24218.81s]  It's so hard to aim this stick
[24231.15s -> 24232.59s]  Holy shit
[24232.59s -> 24259.02s]  All right, get me out of the scope
[24260.70s -> 24265.82s]  Take the scope off
[24266.62s -> 24284.48s]  Give me my keyboard and give me my mouse back
[24285.44s -> 24331.44s]  Oh fuck that didn't hit him. What else we got?
[24333.28s -> 24343.00s]  Front door open up
[24343.32s -> 24364.06s]  That was crazy
[24364.14s -> 24369.98s]  They might be on the way now. Let's grab something to get out grab something search the area for weapons
[24371.88s -> 24376.89s]  There might be guns in these wag. Oh, what about the gatling gun?
[24379.42s -> 24381.34s]  This could be promised
[24381.34s -> 24384.91s]  What do you got here come on
[24388.94s -> 24394.94s]  We can sail those right we sure can we'll check the rest later now come on let's go
[24396.89s -> 24401.37s]  This uh, can we remove the dynamite off this thing? I don't think I want the dynamite
[24405.31s -> 24407.87s]  Is this a scenario where any little bump will cause a problem?
[24408.59s -> 24417.60s]  I'm doing it. I'm trying to go as fast as I can
[24422.51s -> 24424.51s]  Shoot the dynamite the turbo boost
[24425.61s -> 24427.61s]  Something tells me that's not gonna work
[24432.03s -> 24434.67s]  What's a black feller doing coming out of shady bell
[24435.39s -> 24439.23s]  In one hour wagon, you see
[24440.83s -> 24444.75s]  We already dropped a bunch of your people to get this wagon
[24445.39s -> 24447.95s]  You're gonna make us drop the three of you as well
[24449.63s -> 24456.84s]  The heart the brain
[24458.97s -> 24460.97s]  And ahead
[24462.81s -> 24484.72s]  I can't see anyone chasing us. How do you get I are three
[24492.01s -> 24494.78s]  We did it let's move
[24499.28s -> 24501.28s]  The heart the brain
[24518.36s -> 24521.72s]  We'll see what we do I might take a little break tomorrow
[24524.01s -> 24526.73s]  Depends who know I could just wake up and want to do it again
[24528.73s -> 24530.73s]  But ever since we've gotten internet back
[24531.47s -> 24534.03s]  Well, let's rephrase that ever since the internet has been gone
[24534.75s -> 24538.91s]  It's really the only thing we've been focusing on every day since two weeks ago. Okay
[24539.47s -> 24541.47s]  There's still a lot of other random shit that needs to get done
[24543.52s -> 24548.32s]  So I might take tomorrow to do some of that and when I get done with it might be i'll turn the stream on
[24549.12s -> 24556.51s]  I'm, just glad i've been able to stream for three straight days four straight days in a row without any major problems. So that's
[24557.47s -> 24559.47s]  That's good. Good news. I think
[24559.79s -> 24566.25s]  When's the green screen plan the green screen is planned?
[24567.45s -> 24569.45s]  For at some point over this weekend
[24569.53s -> 24571.53s]  And if not this weekend, then either
[24572.01s -> 24574.01s]  I would assume monday or tuesday of next week
[24574.33s -> 24577.71s]  the terms, uh
[24577.71s -> 24579.71s]  Just based on studio time
[24582.89s -> 24585.21s]  I'll have a clear answer for you in the next probably day or two
[24597.69s -> 24599.69s]  I still have my la noir save
[24604.67s -> 24606.67s]  I don't think I do
[24607.71s -> 24609.71s]  You can
[24610.67s -> 24612.67s]  Hey you too
[24618.04s -> 24626.46s]  Are they cloud safe bolt action rifle is now available to modify it because you now own it
[24628.67s -> 24629.95s]  All right. Cool
[24629.95s -> 24632.32s]  So let me just
[24632.32s -> 24636.44s]  I think it's pretty good time to stop
[24636.44s -> 24638.44s]  And that is where we're going to stop
[24640.25s -> 24649.74s]  Right here. But yeah, I don't I get to check on the la noir thing. See if I can pick up where I left off
[24651.92s -> 24653.28s]  oh
[24653.28s -> 24655.85s]  boy
[24655.93s -> 24659.77s]  So, uh la not la no more red dead red and if I stream tomorrow
[24660.49s -> 24667.05s]  It probably won't be red dead. I might change my mind, but we'll probably pivot to something else
[24669.36s -> 24671.52s]  Tomorrow is wednesday, right?
[24672.95s -> 24674.95s]  technically, well, yeah
[24674.97s -> 24677.61s]  well for it's 9 30 right now pacific, but
[24678.72s -> 24680.72s]  So tomorrow's technically wednesday. So
[24681.12s -> 24684.96s]  I might give myself a day to get to get the green screen situated for the weekend
[24686.20s -> 24688.20s]  And then come back on thursday
[24689.16s -> 24691.08s]  Or wednesday night
[24691.08s -> 24693.40s]  We'll see like I said, I don't really have a schedule right now
[24694.86s -> 24697.66s]  So i'm trying to figure that out as we speak
[24699.16s -> 24701.16s]  But thanks everybody for sticking around
[24701.40s -> 24703.40s]  I will see you all very very soon
[24704.81s -> 24707.45s]  Thanks again for watching red dead is a wonderful game
[24709.55s -> 24714.65s]  Uh highly recommend so let's go ahead and do the bits while they're here, you know
[24715.29s -> 24720.60s]  Let's go back a while here back to here
[24723.32s -> 24724.52s]  had
[24724.52s -> 24727.08s]  200 bits two bucks from ivory
[24728.80s -> 24730.80s]  Thank you ivory for the two dollars
[24730.80s -> 24732.48s]  Hey germa has
[24732.48s -> 24736.56s]  It's been a hot while since I caught your live stream due to job searching and european trips
[24737.20s -> 24742.32s]  That said I always enjoy the videos that get posted on your second channel and i'm so happy to see wall dad finally posted
[24743.12s -> 24746.56s]  Special thanks to holy mac then can't wait to see more of the funny man
[24747.20s -> 24751.84s]  Also side question. Have you voted yet or can you not do that now that you are in nevada?
[24753.29s -> 24754.59s]  well
[24754.59s -> 24757.55s]  Uh for the purposes of uh political stuff
[24758.11s -> 24761.79s]  We don't talk about politics on this stream. That's a very very important rule
[24764.75s -> 24766.75s]  And unless we're uh, unless we're
[24767.55s -> 24769.39s]  We make a joke
[24769.39s -> 24772.65s]  He can't do it because he's a convict
[24777.50s -> 24781.50s]  Yeah, you know, I mean I did got you like arrested nine times so
[24783.53s -> 24786.25s]  I'm actually coming to you from a federal prison right now
[24793.47s -> 24796.16s]  so
[24796.16s -> 24798.92s]  To answer the first part here
[24798.92s -> 24803.24s]  I am very glad to see wall dad as well because that was that's one of my favorite games of the year
[24807.61s -> 24825.37s]  Little boys can't vote. Oh my god. It's francis in jail, too
[24829.42s -> 24831.98s]  Uh
[24831.98s -> 24836.08s]  No, but thank you, dude
[24836.92s -> 24840.04s]  Thank you bro. Luck for the five dollars. I'm very poor and I don't have much money
[24844.99s -> 24849.39s]  German doesn't know politics enough that yes, I voted. Well, okay. No, I did not vote. There you go
[24850.94s -> 24852.94s]  And i'll tell you one reason why because the move
[24853.58s -> 24855.58s]  I didn't have like an opportunity
[24856.14s -> 24858.14s]  To go register in nevada
[24859.15s -> 24860.27s]  so
[24860.27s -> 24861.31s]  Sorry
[24861.31s -> 24867.23s]  There's been a lot going on. I just didn't have an opportunity to
[24873.20s -> 24875.20s]  I am registered to vote in
[24876.62s -> 24886.88s]  Massachusetts still so literally satan
[24887.60s -> 24892.00s]  I actually was going to do it. I think you could do it. There's like a way you could have done it or something. I just
[24892.96s -> 24894.96s]  There's been so much bullshit going on here
[24896.19s -> 24900.27s]  The whole internet thing moving in here. I just it was something that I just couldn't even think
[24907.90s -> 24910.19s]  but hopefully
[24910.19s -> 24912.67s]  All of you have a voice to your opinions
[24913.47s -> 24915.84s]  Because it is important at least if you know
[24916.56s -> 24918.56s]  talking about the american election stuff
[24925.15s -> 24928.11s]  and the candidates for nevada, too, that's another thing like I
[24930.08s -> 24933.68s]  Just need I haven't I don't like know the area. I don't know the people
[24939.63s -> 24941.63s]  I bet he voted for dean dingus
[24944.48s -> 24946.48s]  I wrote in germa
[24946.88s -> 24954.33s]  Oh god
[24954.33s -> 24956.33s]  but I I am planning on
[24956.89s -> 24960.16s]  being uh
[24960.22s -> 24962.03s]  Registered
[24962.03s -> 24964.03s]  But there's other reasons why?
[24968.84s -> 24974.38s]  For do not get political, uh, because I don't like to talk about it on the stream. Like I said
[24975.63s -> 24976.75s]  um
[24976.75s -> 24981.72s]  I don't know. I can't really talk about it as to why like i'm
[24982.97s -> 24984.73s]  I haven't like voted
[24984.73s -> 25000.01s]  It's understandable the tough thing with politics is
[25003.69s -> 25005.69s]  No, no, no, no, no, wait, whatever
[25012.33s -> 25015.45s]  It would be impossible to explain some of these things without
[25016.09s -> 25022.33s]  Somehow making somebody angry and that's kind of sad. I think in the current political spectrum
[25026.03s -> 25028.03s]  He wants to talk about it so bad
[25037.63s -> 25048.04s]  No
[25048.04s -> 25050.36s]  He didn't vote because he's not actually american
[25051.00s -> 25057.79s]  No, we'll just move on
[25057.79s -> 25062.67s]  That is actually something that i'm gonna try to get done here though is to like register in nevada
[25065.37s -> 25073.12s]  But we'll move on
[25073.12s -> 25075.36s]  Anywho
[25075.36s -> 25077.42s]  Thank you to
[25077.42s -> 25080.36s]  um
[25080.36s -> 25082.76s]  Div usp. Thanks for the three bucks. No message. Thank you
[25090.72s -> 25094.16s]  Just the last couple of nights div usp has just given money. Thank you
[25096.91s -> 25102.19s]  A burger. Thank you burger b for the five dollars here burger b. Thank you turbo heart to you
[25105.79s -> 25110.83s]  Dungeness. Thank you dungeness for the one dollar. Hey germa a couple of people in discord and I worked on this for a few days straight
[25111.31s -> 25113.23s]  And I was hoping you could play it on stream
[25113.23s -> 25116.51s]  A few sleepless nights were had to try to get this out before you started streaming again
[25116.59s -> 25118.59s]  Your move is very close to home
[25118.75s -> 25120.27s]  for me because
[25120.27s -> 25122.91s]  I'm going to be moving to from oregon to new zealand
[25123.55s -> 25127.95s]  For a university in a couple months and i'll be there for the next eight years at least damn
[25128.91s -> 25138.36s]  That's a long time
[25138.36s -> 25139.48s]  uh
[25139.48s -> 25141.71s]  Yeah, well, we'll watch it
[25141.71s -> 25147.53s]  We'll watch let's watch it at the end but good luck with the move. That's a that's a long ways, man
[25148.25s -> 25155.77s]  It's very far away
[25155.77s -> 25160.65s]  Hopefully that is very smoothly go smoothly for you. Okay, except just going from
[25161.51s -> 25163.51s]  massachusetts to nevada was
[25164.20s -> 25171.48s]  Fucking painful so I can imagine going from oregon to new zealand will be tough. So good luck to you
[25172.20s -> 25176.68s]  And we'll play it at the end of the stream
[25176.68s -> 25180.60s]  Uh wild fox. Thanks for the one dollar. Thank you for what you said on my ten dollar bits the other night
[25180.68s -> 25183.16s]  I'm doing my best in your infectious laugh does wonders
[25183.72s -> 25186.12s]  How is life treating you in vegas now that you settled in a little bit?
[25188.17s -> 25189.21s]  um
[25189.21s -> 25192.33s]  Settling in nicely. I think the last three or four days
[25192.97s -> 25195.61s]  Especially the last probably four or five days
[25196.65s -> 25198.83s]  Has really let me breathe a little
[25199.79s -> 25201.79s]  Because it's been three weeks straight of
[25202.59s -> 25204.59s]  Just kind of bullshit on top of bullshit
[25206.83s -> 25208.83s]  That I haven't really had much time
[25208.99s -> 25210.67s]  To myself
[25210.67s -> 25212.67s]  And not time my time to myself. I mean
[25214.43s -> 25219.07s]  It's there's been something going on every day that needed 100 of my attention
[25220.60s -> 25222.57s]  and now
[25222.57s -> 25227.85s]  I can kind of just chill now as as of probably today or yesterday
[25232.41s -> 25234.41s]  so thankfully it's
[25234.41s -> 25236.17s]  Time to take a breather
[25236.17s -> 25238.73s]  Step back and actually enjoy and understand like where I am
[25241.95s -> 25247.47s]  So the the moving process went through all the internet you I wish I could even describe
[25248.51s -> 25250.99s]  Just how painful that internet process was
[25252.43s -> 25254.56s]  We would have to sit here
[25254.56s -> 25256.56s]  And wait for a technician to show up
[25258.59s -> 25260.59s]  Nine technicians have come over here
[25261.61s -> 25264.00s]  three supervisors
[25264.00s -> 25265.76s]  It's been every day
[25265.76s -> 25269.28s]  We've been doing it every single day. It's the only thing we've been thinking about and doing
[25272.04s -> 25274.36s]  And they they told us they finally figured it out. So
[25275.40s -> 25279.96s]  Uh, but then just trying to figure out when like the trash comes and
[25280.60s -> 25286.36s]  Where things are it's it's a throwing yourself into a brand new thing that you've never seen or done before
[25287.80s -> 25291.16s]  It's very i've never done it before it's actually never happened
[25291.56s -> 25296.72s]  This is the first time in my whole life that i've just kind of thrown myself into a completely different place
[25298.19s -> 25300.91s]  and something you don't realize when you do that is
[25302.06s -> 25304.06s]  Everything starts from scratch
[25305.16s -> 25310.33s]  Everything so I mean my whole life
[25310.97s -> 25315.87s]  literally everything everything i've ever done everything i've ever said everything i've ever been was massachusetts
[25317.58s -> 25322.46s]  And you start to realize all the little things that just don't follow you here
[25324.47s -> 25326.47s]  It's a brand new fresh start
[25330.46s -> 25332.46s]  and it's equally parts refreshing and
[25333.58s -> 25334.82s]  um
[25334.82s -> 25336.82s]  Kind of nerve-wracking too
[25339.06s -> 25341.06s]  I love it out here though. I think it's great
[25345.85s -> 25347.85s]  His debt can't get him now
[25347.93s -> 25354.10s]  It's okay germ I lived here in texas my entire life and I still don't know where the trash comes
[25356.68s -> 25358.33s]  uh
[25358.33s -> 25363.21s]  But it's been wild and i'm i'm finally happy just to be able to get kind of off the ride for a little while
[25363.93s -> 25366.25s]  And get back to what I was doing
[25367.13s -> 25369.02s]  which was this
[25369.02s -> 25370.90s]  and
[25370.90s -> 25372.90s]  Being able to at least even enjoy
[25373.54s -> 25375.14s]  Anything else besides?
[25375.14s -> 25380.66s]  Okay, so i'm gonna get a new insurance. I don't have health insurance right now. I've been having like weird medical problems
[25380.74s -> 25382.74s]  I need health insurance, but how long does that take?
[25382.98s -> 25387.22s]  I gotta get like a letter of termination from my other insurance. Okay. No, I don't have health insurance though
[25387.22s -> 25392.02s]  Okay, but what about like other? Okay. I gotta pay the rent. Okay. Hold on but uh
[25392.90s -> 25397.06s]  What's what day is it? I don't have a couch. We need to go get a soap. We don't have any furniture
[25397.70s -> 25400.34s]  I can only fit so much in my moving thing
[25401.93s -> 25403.93s]  It's been like that every fucking day
[25408.94s -> 25411.32s]  But we're good now
[25411.32s -> 25415.29s]  All everything's gravy
[25415.29s -> 25417.29s]  Thank you gaga pudding for the two bucks
[25418.62s -> 25421.18s]  I'm just popping in here to give you a couple bits. I'm glad you move went well
[25421.18s -> 25423.18s]  And I hope you didn't hit too many squirrels
[25423.82s -> 25427.42s]  Well, I was in an airplane. So that would have been really weird
[25429.46s -> 25434.02s]  Bullwinkle would have been really upset if if we had hit a squirrel in the ear. Let's just say that
[25438.12s -> 25441.32s]  Uh, thank you lazy luke for the three dollars. I already asked before you move
[25441.32s -> 25445.40s]  But can I make your ideas of something fun with the end of the stream subs?
[25446.12s -> 25450.44s]  I would try my best
[25450.44s -> 25452.44s]  Yeah, I think i'd like to get some input
[25452.52s -> 25456.92s]  From a lot of different people to see like what would be fun to do and what would be even possible to do
[25462.65s -> 25464.57s]  Whatever the possibilities are
[25464.57s -> 25469.56s]  I would love to see them
[25469.56s -> 25471.56s]  So, I mean i'll be around the discord
[25472.46s -> 25475.58s]  I'll probably be talking about i'll probably bring it up at some point in the discord
[25476.46s -> 25478.46s]  And maybe talk to some of the mods about
[25478.78s -> 25480.78s]  Maybe try to figure out something fun to do
[25480.78s -> 25484.26s]  suggestion wise
[25484.26s -> 25490.41s]  But thank you lazy luke
[25490.41s -> 25492.41s]  And yeah, I I will probably
[25493.69s -> 25497.37s]  I'll put up more a cleaner forum than just like general chat
[25499.94s -> 25502.58s]  Uh gaga pudding. Thank you again for two dollars. Hey, it's me again
[25502.58s -> 25506.02s]  I hope you didn't hit any flying squirrels either. They're a fierce bunch. Well, there you go
[25506.98s -> 25510.31s]  There's the flying squirrel
[25510.39s -> 25512.33s]  Flying squirrel bit

[25528.09s -> 25530.57s]  Gaga pudding again. Thanks for five dollars gaga pudding
[25531.82s -> 25536.70s]  Hey, jeremy never mind the squirrels this time. I remember when I first saw your shme videos and I thought they were hilarious
[25537.18s -> 25541.02s]  So I sold them showed them some of my friends in school and only got blank stares
[25541.50s -> 25543.58s]  That's when I realized that I had found something special
[25545.77s -> 25548.14s]  Thanks, dude
[25549.91s -> 25553.99s]  Uh, i've already told you the story about how I showed that girl the auto video and then she like
[25554.97s -> 25557.13s]  Literally did not want to talk to me anymore

[25747.53s -> 25750.44s]  swat four
[25750.44s -> 25757.66s]  Now we haven't done that yet. Love you stream. My state of michigan just legalized weed. Can't wait for the green screen stream
[25758.38s -> 25761.37s]  Well, there you go
[25761.37s -> 25763.37s]  Uh, we haven't done swat four yet though
[25764.07s -> 25767.62s]  swat four
[25767.62s -> 25771.46s]  Star and I were gonna play swat four, but it's the all you can't play it online
[25771.46s -> 25773.46s]  You have to do like weird shit. We were trying to figure it up
[25776.76s -> 25778.92s]  But the state of michigan is legalized weed
[25781.03s -> 25785.08s]  Hell, yeah
[25785.08s -> 25787.24s]  Hey garfield of undead killer. Thanks for the one dollar
[25788.23s -> 25790.63s]  uh, you never guess who
[25790.71s -> 25794.79s]  Who I heard from francis the fox contacted me after you burnt yourself to death
[25795.59s -> 25801.11s]  He got you a postcard from the ghost ghost soul train. He told me to tell you i'm keeping the train full of souls for you
[25801.67s -> 25803.67s]  If you ever feel like coming back
[25803.75s -> 25805.75s]  Miss you, don't forget to write
[25805.75s -> 25808.06s]  You got any nice words for francis?
[25816.58s -> 25820.18s]  Getting political. No, is that that's I we don't talk about politics
[25826.46s -> 25829.26s]  Marijuana is legal in las vegas. It is completely
[25831.80s -> 25833.80s]  I don't smoke marijuana. I don't
[25834.92s -> 25836.92s]  But I know the medical
[25837.80s -> 25839.80s]  And recreational purposes for it
[25840.28s -> 25843.42s]  I mean i'm not gonna get political
[25845.77s -> 25850.01s]  That's like okay. But all right. First of all saying that you're in favor of marijuana use
[25851.74s -> 25855.18s]  Is as if that's barely even a political statement anymore
[25859.88s -> 25862.12s]  That's not that's like not even political anymore
[25866.44s -> 25872.33s]  It's just an opinion at this point
[25872.33s -> 25874.33s]  No politics. I know I
[25877.30s -> 25880.82s]  Sometimes I wish we could just talk politics like very very like just
[25881.46s -> 25884.50s]  Plainly insanely, but it's not it's not possible
[25888.14s -> 25892.88s]  Everybody's so different. Everybody has so many different views that it's just it's impossible
[25896.90s -> 25899.94s]  I don't know. I mean like not that I do but i'm just saying like something like
[25900.82s -> 25902.97s]  it's hard
[25902.97s -> 25904.17s]  because
[25904.17s -> 25909.29s]  I mean there are people that are here, right? Let's just say that there is you know, two three thousand people there and I say something
[25909.93s -> 25911.93s]  And I say something that I that I believe right?
[25913.42s -> 25916.30s]  It just it's it's always going to just cause a problem
[25918.46s -> 25923.74s]  Even if the thing that I think would be I believe in you know, I just it's just hard you can't
[25924.46s -> 25930.94s]  It's not impossible. People just need to be more willing to listen to others
[25931.93s -> 25935.37s]  Yeah
[25935.37s -> 25938.30s]  Yeah
[25938.30s -> 25939.98s]  Yes
[25939.98s -> 25941.74s]  Yeah, yes
[25941.74s -> 25949.61s]  Political parties. Yeah, I mean like yes, that's all I can say. Yes
[25955.61s -> 25959.13s]  We're willing to listen to your opinions as long as you don't support bubzy 3d
[25960.34s -> 25961.46s]  Yes
[25961.46s -> 25972.57s]  The only thing is people are very dynamic
[25973.86s -> 25977.83s]  and
[25977.83s -> 25981.54s]  Yes
[25981.54s -> 25983.54s]  That's it
[25989.05s -> 25991.05s]  How could you say something like that?
[25992.17s -> 26005.54s]  Yes, that's it
[26005.54s -> 26007.06s]  I agree with that
[26007.06s -> 26015.00s]  Who should I vote for? Yes
[26015.08s -> 26021.61s]  I honestly don't want to know germans political views. I've already had artists and entertainers
[26021.61s -> 26025.45s]  I admire tarnished in my eyes by knowing their views and I'd rather that not happen with me
[26027.59s -> 26030.55s]  Yeah, I don't I just don't want I don't want that either
[26033.27s -> 26035.35s]  I don't think any of the things that I believe are
[26036.86s -> 26038.86s]  That out of the ordinary or that
[26039.34s -> 26041.02s]  crazy or anything
[26041.02s -> 26044.15s]  I like to try to think as myself is
[26044.71s -> 26046.02s]  just
[26046.02s -> 26048.34s]  try to look at issues rationally and
[26049.46s -> 26052.26s]  I don't think there's anything I could ever really say that would be like, whoa
[26052.74s -> 26055.14s]  What the fuck did he just say?
[26056.18s -> 26058.02s]  I don't think so
[26058.02s -> 26066.33s]  That's what everyone thinks about their own beliefs. That's why they believe it. That's true. That's you know, that that's completely 100 true
[26076.49s -> 26079.45s]  Stop before you regret no, I would never i'm not i'm not gonna say
[26080.09s -> 26086.26s]  Very much at all. So don't worry
[26086.26s -> 26089.94s]  The only reason why it's even brought up in the first place is because like today was the day
[26093.21s -> 26095.93s]  So that's the only reason why it's even brought up in the first place
[26109.69s -> 26114.25s]  I can't believe how level-headed this guy is. I haven't even like made any opinions. I've said yes
[26115.05s -> 26116.65s]  and
[26116.65s -> 26124.58s]  That's all i've said
[26124.74s -> 26127.10s]  This guy said yes
[26127.10s -> 26128.46s]  but anywho
[26128.46s -> 26130.46s]  Um, it's just because today was the day
[26131.18s -> 26135.02s]  And some people have questions and opinions and and I get it like people want to know
[26136.22s -> 26140.94s]  Hey, I I did this. I I voted you voted and what what did you vote for and it's like
[26142.60s -> 26144.06s]  You know just
[26144.06s -> 26147.42s]  It is today was the day of all these um
[26148.86s -> 26150.86s]  changes in seats and stuff so
[26151.50s -> 26153.50s]  Makes sense as to why people
[26153.58s -> 26161.56s]  wanted to know
[26161.96s -> 26164.41s]  Thanks for the one dollar
[26164.41s -> 26169.21s]  Excited for you to get back to la noir, although I don't know if you're what your plan probably will be for the save
[26169.69s -> 26174.25s]  I don't know if you can download a save for the ps4 or download for the pc and download a save there
[26175.05s -> 26180.41s]  Because with a 100 save you can access all the cases or just play it on your own your choice
[26182.01s -> 26186.41s]  I'll have to see how that I didn't get that far in la noir. So I don't think it'll be that much of a problem
[26192.36s -> 26193.88s]  But thank you, dude
[26193.88s -> 26196.52s]  Thank you chubby funster for the one dollar. Thanks for streaming these three days in a row
[26196.52s -> 26200.68s]  It's been great that train bit was amazing really needed this after a scary morning
[26201.40s -> 26207.40s]  I was going into my room to make some business calls worth millions when I suddenly see and I shit you not the biggest spider
[26207.40s -> 26208.52s]  I've ever seen
[26208.52s -> 26213.88s]  I slowly left my from saying that spider is fucked the spider now owns my room when I sleep in the bath. Thanks, dude
[26216.06s -> 26218.30s]  I was waiting for one. I was waiting for one to show up
[26223.62s -> 26225.62s]  Thanks with millions
[26226.44s -> 26229.32s]  Shoot man. Thank you shoot man for the one dollar keep up the good work my dude
[26229.32s -> 26233.24s]  I'm currently finishing my undergrad at university and i'm thinking of doing a masters
[26233.96s -> 26239.72s]  Your streams always give good vibes and it makes studying fun. I had a dream comcast never turned off your internet
[26240.28s -> 26242.28s]  And you kept streaming for a month straight
[26242.44s -> 26247.16s]  You stayed in the house when new tenants moved in and living in the walls never stopping the stream
[26247.32s -> 26250.44s]  The tenants were trying to investigate random snorting noises like it was a ghost
[26251.80s -> 26253.80s]  I'm glad that's not real
[26257.69s -> 26259.91s]  Thank you shoot man
[26259.91s -> 26264.55s]  Uh, thank you hippo rider for the one dollar. Hey germa want to know your thoughts on fallout 76 and doom eternal
[26265.35s -> 26267.83s]  Also, love your content helped me through so many very tough times
[26269.38s -> 26271.38s]  I don't really I don't have any opinions on either of them
[26271.86s -> 26277.43s]  The only opinions the only things I know about fallout 76 are that like the game just like didn't work
