[0.70s -> 10.34s]  Hey, what's up? Hey, hey, what's going on guys? How you doing? Hey, hey, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[10.34s -> 16.78s]  Can you hear me? Is this thing on? Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, pep, pep, pep. Real voice. Wait, what
[16.78s -> 25.80s]  happened? I don't know why the GoXLR does this. Did I fix it? Hold on. Can you hear me? I sound
[25.80s -> 45.69s]  fucked up. I do? That's good. All right. Let me, hold on a second. Why are you linking a clip
[46.57s -> 53.67s]  of you thinking that I farted on stream once like two years ago or like a year ago or something?
[54.31s -> 62.02s]  Why even link that? I have never farted on stream. See, a lot of you guys probably don't
[62.02s -> 69.21s]  understand this, but streamers have direct access to be able to control when you can and cannot hear
[69.21s -> 77.11s]  them. Most streamers have a button that they can just press and it just mutes the microphone.
[78.14s -> 85.98s]  Now, I've never farted on stream, but I farted during the stream hundreds of times. I just
[85.98s -> 92.86s]  mute the microphone and just let it go. You don't even know what happened. You have no idea.
[92.86s -> 98.78s]  I'm just like, okay, here comes one. Mute. I could sit there for 10 seconds and just fart a burp and
[98.78s -> 106.17s]  shit and then come back and you did not even know that I left. Guys, I've taken entire phone calls
[107.66s -> 112.95s]  while muted during cut scene before. Like, oh shit, I gotta make, I gotta make a quick phone call.
[112.95s -> 119.58s]  Mute. Oh, we're in a cut scene. Who cares? And then right when the cut scene's over, I gotta go,
[119.58s -> 134.26s]  I gotta go, gotta go. Bye. Whoa, un-mute. Whoa, cool cut scene, guys. I'm sorry. He hates us.
[137.70s -> 145.19s]  Sorry, I wasn't live yesterday. I'm on a new medicine and the medicine is a very common medicine,
[145.19s -> 151.11s]  but I got some annoying side effects. It's a stomach medicine and it made me kind of feel like
[151.11s -> 156.14s]  shit. I started taking it like two days ago. So we're going to take it easy today.
[156.94s -> 163.37s]  I'll acclimate to the new medicine. This stream's going to be probably pretty short,
[164.01s -> 170.28s]  maybe a few hours, maybe. I'm just going to chill. And in the recommended channel,
[171.00s -> 176.15s]  there was a game that was highly recommended. It's a game where you make your own chocolates
[176.15s -> 181.29s]  and you have your own chocolate company. So that's exactly what we're going to do.
[182.18s -> 188.17s]  Tomorrow, we're going to play Connect and we're going to play Connect the day after that too.
[188.17s -> 193.59s]  I mean, how am I going to, am I not going to play Connectibles? I've had that sitting there
[193.59s -> 199.00s]  for like a year, more than that. I have so much Connect that I, this is like still,
[199.00s -> 207.90s]  there's probably like 10 plus Connect games to play. When are you going to play Boom Blocks?
[208.92s -> 215.34s]  I don't, I don't know. Can we go back to the Wii eventually? What about GTA RP? Yeah, I,
[216.70s -> 222.14s]  I just haven't had time to do it. I haven't had time to like get into it and like apply and sign
[222.14s -> 226.94s]  up. The, the archeology stream is taken up most of the time and another one, two other streams
[226.94s -> 232.17s]  actually. We're going to, we're going to go bang, bang, bang, bang with streams here
[233.34s -> 242.31s]  over the next few months. The archeology stream is going to be a lot of fun. I can't wait.
[242.31s -> 245.27s]  I can't wait. I don't, I'm not going to, I don't want to talk about it that much because it's like,
[247.11s -> 256.28s]  you'll see, just March 6th, you'll see, it's going to be fun. And no, there's no Catboy stream.
[256.28s -> 269.40s]  That's not, Catboy is not one of them. Catboy is not one of them. Why? Well, because I'm not,
[269.40s -> 274.36s]  I want to get that ready. I'm not just putting the ears on. I'm not putting the ears on and going
[274.36s -> 280.92s]  like, that's not going to happen. I mean, I probably, I probably will do that as a joke.
[281.48s -> 294.14s]  That what I just did. No, there's a lot going to just, just wait, just wait and see.
[298.36s -> 301.08s]  That stream is going to be a lot different than maybe you think it is.
[302.28s -> 314.18s]  You're going to be a Catboy tryhard. Yeah. Yes. What are you going to do? You're just going to
[314.18s -> 320.42s]  have to watch. If I, I don't want to tell you what happens on the TV show before the TV show comes
[320.42s -> 333.51s]  out. I'm not, by the way, I'm not going to be on a TV show. All right. This is, this is, this game
[333.51s -> 341.51s]  is going to be probably awesome or horrible. It depends on which one. I am hoping that this is,
[342.15s -> 349.43s]  from the looks of it, we get to design our own chocolates and own lattes. I can't wait. It's
[349.43s -> 357.98s]  going to be fucking awesome. Do you have a play? Well, that you, that, that word,
[357.98s -> 364.06s]  that word should be banned in this chat. No. All right. Here we go. We're going to,
[364.06s -> 368.14s]  this is called chocolatier decadence by design. And apparently there are like four of these.
[368.94s -> 379.08s]  Is the, my webcam on pointing at me? I hope not. Let's cover it to make sure we're good.
[388.47s -> 398.15s]  And here at the olive garden, you can get two entrees for only 2.99. It's another olive garden
[398.15s -> 406.33s]  game. Our soup, salad and breadsticks are talk of the town. Chocolatier decadence by design.
[410.46s -> 414.46s]  All right. Hell, I thought that was dog food. I was like, how is this chocolate? Is it a can
[414.46s -> 421.62s]  of dog food? All right. Welcome chocolatier. Welcome to the world of chocolatier. Generations
[421.62s -> 427.06s]  ago, confectioner Martin Pohlmeister founded the chocolate company that bears his name.
[427.06s -> 432.42s]  And for over a hundred years, the company has survived family squabbles, hostile competitors,
[432.42s -> 437.51s]  and economic ups and downs. Just like the olive garden. Today in the twin shadows of the great
[437.51s -> 441.19s]  depression and world war two, the company's factories have been converted for the war effort
[441.19s -> 448.81s]  or lie unused. And the disappearance of her husband, Sean has left Alex Tanguy Fletcher
[448.81s -> 465.83s]  unavailable to steer the company. Can you help them? And what, there was an intro? Okay. Oh yeah.
[465.83s -> 472.78s]  Flash player is uninstalled. It doesn't exist anymore. Right. Okay. We'll just imagine you
[472.78s -> 482.09s]  watched it. Oh shit. Can I play this game? Can I play this game? I don't think I can play this game.
[482.09s -> 492.50s]  This game not going to work. Oh shit. Hold on. Please enter your name. Um, what should my name be?
[492.50s -> 497.64s]  Oh no. I hope it's not flash. It's it's I probably can't even play this. I probably can't even play
[497.64s -> 505.18s]  this game. Well, okay. Well, let's find out. Don't be so upset about it yet. All right. My name.
[505.18s -> 516.42s]  What's a chocolatier name? I don't know. Um, Angus Angus is not to me does not scream chocolatier.
[516.42s -> 523.74s]  Angus to me screams hamburger. Derma the chocolate boy. That's my name.
[529.77s -> 539.74s]  Steve. That's a, that's my full name. The last no Angus. No, get off of that meme. For God's sakes.
[539.74s -> 556.44s]  You're driving us mad. All right. Wonka Angus con zilly zonka, silly wonka, silly, silly,
[556.44s -> 565.53s]  Willy Wonka. No, that's just Willy Wonka with a silly, silly Willy. I think I kind of like silly
[565.53s -> 582.22s]  Willy. Silly, silly Willy Wonderful. That sounds like an old WWF character. I feel like that's,
[582.22s -> 586.62s]  I feel like that's the guy that came up with doink the clown sometimes. Silly Willy Wonderful
[586.62s -> 603.18s]  was berserker. Silly Willy zonka. I hate that. No, I'm not doing zilly zonka. You can just add a Z
[603.18s -> 616.06s]  and make it funny. Keep it silly Willy zonka. I hate that. Yes, you can. It does make it funny.
[616.06s -> 623.77s]  Watch me. Silly Willy zonka. How about silly zonka? Yeah. Silly zonka is better than Willy
[623.77s -> 635.30s]  Wonka. Okay. Silly zonka. Silly zonka. Silly, silly zonka Wonka. Oh, perfect. That's like a
[635.30s -> 646.34s]  good like copyright free version. Silly zonka Wonka. I don't care. Oh my God. I thought it
[646.34s -> 657.05s]  just didn't work. That car was just driving off the road. Did anybody see that? That car was just
[657.05s -> 661.53s]  skidding out of control. That was like a Homer Simpson car. All right. We're supposed to chill.
[662.17s -> 668.14s]  Look, look. Calm down. I'm supposed to relax. For most people, World War Two is... Why is this
[668.14s -> 674.20s]  World War Two? For most people, World War Two is finally over. Not for me. Until my husband Sean
[674.20s -> 682.14s]  is accounted for. The war rages on. Wait, what? I won't mince words. Silly zonka Wonka. Bow master
[682.14s -> 687.96s]  confections is in shambles. And I simply can't focus on chocolate right now. I need someone else
[687.96s -> 701.56s]  to manage the company. Okay. You need to show me you can make chocolates and money.
[701.56s -> 707.08s]  Once you have made at least $10,000, I'll make you CEO candidate and start introducing you to
[707.08s -> 715.94s]  the board of directors. That's not very much to be CEO. To make $10,000 for a conglomerate company,
[715.94s -> 724.79s]  that's not to be the CEO. Oh, it's World War Two. How much is $10,000 in World War Two bucks?
[724.79s -> 729.26s]  Like in World War Two dollars. Like with inflation and the change of the U.S. dollar
[729.26s -> 739.80s]  and everything. And the yields, whatever that means. How much was $10,000 now? It's not billions
[739.80s -> 748.63s]  of dollars. It's probably like 300 grand, maybe 200 grand. $145,000. That's okay. That's a lot
[748.63s -> 755.37s]  of money. That's a lot of money. All right. So let's get started. Here are 100 sacks each of sugar
[755.37s -> 761.05s]  and cocoa. Go see Endrid over at Zurich Chocolate Works to turn these ingredients into chocolates.
[762.22s -> 769.27s]  You're just gonna hand them to me? Hey, Zilly Wonka. I've got 100 bags of sugar in the back
[769.27s -> 777.37s]  of the truck. Here you are. Here they are. Just dumped them on the ground. Introduce yourself to
[777.37s -> 785.67s]  Endrid Rost over at Zurich Chocolate Works. Holy shit, these people are fucking crazy.
[785.67s -> 789.91s]  These cars are freaking. Is this a one-way road? Is this a two-way road? Why are there
[789.91s -> 800.66s]  cars parked over here? All right, where do I go? Zurich Chocolate Works. Okay, recipes,
[800.66s -> 806.89s]  inventory, quest log, menu, awards. Oh, Swiss National Bank. Why? Okay, why do they? You buy
[806.89s -> 813.19s]  my own drugs and I click this. Main Street. Oh, Chocolate Works. I feel for what Alex is going
[813.27s -> 820.33s]  through. Zilly. Why couldn't I just name my name like Adam? I feel for what Alex is going through,
[820.33s -> 825.74s]  silly Zonka Wonka. But boy, am I excited to get these machines working again. Click make chocolates
[825.74s -> 833.83s]  and make at least five cases of basic chocolate bars. Basic chocolate bars. Make at least five
[833.83s -> 843.54s]  cases. Cases per week. You have 60 seconds to set our production rate. What? Aim and click to fire
[843.54s -> 850.02s]  ingredients. Match the full tray you see on the right. I'll speed the machine up as you succeed
[850.02s -> 856.92s]  and slow them down if you miss. Good luck. Why is this a fucking double dare exercise? What do
[856.92s -> 869.91s]  I have to do? What am I? What am I doing? What's happened? Shoots out the window and like hits a
[869.91s -> 878.78s]  fucking building next door. You hear like cat scream. Uh oh, wasted ingredient. Use the full
[878.78s -> 884.63s]  tray on the right as your guide. I'll keep tracking each ingredient you waste up on the right. Waste
[884.63s -> 893.69s]  eight and I'll be forced to halt production. Okay, there we go. Fuck, I got that wrong. What?
[895.51s -> 905.13s]  Okay, coming up is next is oh my god. Okay, I don't understand how this works. These are all
[905.13s -> 914.52s]  wrong. Okay, I have another almond. So the almond has to go over here. What the fuck is happening?
[914.52s -> 923.21s]  Okay, well I don't that one broke. Do I have to aim it into the slot? I have to just match this,
[923.21s -> 938.57s]  but I fail. The hit detection is fucking bizarre. What? I don't have any room for this. I got it.
[938.57s -> 950.46s]  Oh my god. Okay, I got six cases. Oh, what am I doing? As long as you have the needed ingredients
[950.46s -> 956.92s]  in stock, we'll keep making six cases a week. That's fucking stupid. I didn't know what the
[956.92s -> 962.52s]  hell I was looking at. Try again. Okay, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[962.52s -> 972.12s]  The things are in the middle. Here we go. All right, snowball, almond. Wait, it doesn't matter.
[972.12s -> 976.44s]  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It literally doesn't matter. You just have to aim it at it.
[976.44s -> 999.27s]  Doesn't matter. Literally does not matter at all. Come on, get it. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[999.27s -> 1010.28s]  Fuck. Wait, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[1010.28s -> 1017.30s]  Got it. Got it. Oh god. Oh my god, what do I do? All right, 13 cases. That's good. That's good. That's
[1017.30s -> 1022.25s]  good. Oh wait, I thought I heard the fucking Flintstones thing. That means we went out.
[1022.25s -> 1031.27s]  I thought we were done. What the fuck is happening? I don't have any more ingredients.
[1032.89s -> 1044.78s]  Bill, slow down the production. 15 cases per week. All right. Your basic chocolate bars
[1044.78s -> 1050.04s]  look delicious. All products and ingredients appear in your inventory. You can mouse over
[1050.04s -> 1062.50s]  items for more information. Okay, 15 chocolate bar cases. 85 almonds and 85 snowballs. Okay,
[1062.50s -> 1069.61s]  15 cases in inventory. As you travel, you can track how many products we're making in the status
[1069.61s -> 1075.50s]  window below. Inventory levels for each ingredient we're using are shown with color-coded bars. Green
[1075.50s -> 1080.97s]  means we've got plenty. Yellow means we're running low, and red means production will soon be stalled.
[1080.97s -> 1087.69s]  So we always have to keep the snowballs and the almonds up. Speaking of ingredients, in order to
[1087.69s -> 1091.93s]  keep making basic chocolate bars, we'll need more sugar and cocoa soon. You're going to need some
[1091.93s -> 1103.54s]  money. Visit Near Deer Dorf Chocolates to turn your chocolates into cash. Welcome, silly Zonka
[1103.54s -> 1111.02s]  Wonka. Step inside to review my prices. Why is this a cafeteria? Once inside, click sell all.
[1111.02s -> 1117.90s]  I'll take your products and you'll get the cash. This sounds like I'm in the middle of Carr
[1117.90s -> 1128.81s]  and sorcery. This is people dumping gold coins on the counter. Here's what I'm willing to pay
[1128.81s -> 1138.89s]  for your items. So $85. That's it? 15 cases of chocolate bars? That's fucking horrible.

[1145.53s -> 1149.61s]  my pleasure to offer the best prices for quality chocolates. Now go back and speak with Alex. You
[1149.61s -> 1159.30s]  can find her at the Bandhof, the main rail station here in Zurich. Okay, is it hard H or soft H?
[1159.30s -> 1171.70s]  Is it Zurich or Zurich? So it's Zurich. Zurich. Okay, so we're making chocolate though.
[1171.70s -> 1176.17s]  We're making 15 chocolate bars per week. We have enough ingredients for five weeks.

[1190.79s -> 1200.70s]  America. All right, where are we going? The rail station. I was going to say, where's the fireworks?

[1210.74s -> 1214.34s]  and you've made some money. With the factory now operational, I suspect you'll be needing

[1421.34s -> 1426.74s]  She truly believes she'll be able to find her husband. You have to admire her spirit though.
[1426.74s -> 1433.74s]  Okay. Okay. Look at all this inventory I got. Okay. Travel back. This is a I don't want to run
[1433.74s -> 1445.37s]  the money. 117 bucks. Let's go. I think you're starting to get the hang of things silly zilly
[1445.37s -> 1449.13s]  wonka which is good because I need to leave soon. Next make your way back over to Main Street
[1449.13s -> 1453.13s]  Market. Verena has a new ingredient you can use to make a new recipe. Something that's always

[1698.07s -> 1702.79s]  and see Endric Rast. As long as you have caramel sugar and cacao in stock you'll be able to make
[1702.79s -> 1707.66s]  chocolate bars with caramel. And I hear that Endric has a new gizmo at the factory that he's
[1707.66s -> 1720.71s]  eager to show you. Okay I have enough. Okay let's go. You have on hand everything we need to make

[1730.86s -> 1734.94s]  in your gun simply fire the ingredient at the recycler. No more unnecessary waste. Thank you.
[1734.94s -> 1744.26s]  Chocolate bars with caramel. Fresh caramel combined with pure dark chocolate. I need sugar. Don't

[1795.26s -> 1798.78s]  I'll never be as fast as you want me to be. I promise. This is as fast as I'll ever be.
[1798.78s -> 1806.95s]  I will never be faster than this. I promise. I guarantee you. So many people right now I just
[1806.95s -> 1812.86s]  sit watching here going like god his APM is so fucking bad. It doesn't matter. I have to guys

[1855.83s -> 1860.79s]  to make three chocolate recipes. You can travel buy ingredients and sell your products as a profit.
[1860.79s -> 1865.18s]  Once you've built your cash on hand to at least 10 grand Alex will be ready to hand you the reins
[1865.18s -> 1876.81s]  of the company. Good luck. Right. All right. Who wants to. What do I got. I have 18 cases of

[1954.20s -> 1959.40s]  at making chocolates and making money. Now we simply must go. Ready or not the company's in
[1959.40s -> 1966.31s]  your hands as I promised you are now the official CEO candidate of Baumeister confections. There are
[1966.31s -> 1970.23s]  five other members of the Baumeister conventions board of directors. You're going to need to work
[1970.23s -> 1975.03s]  with them each of them one by one to convince them that you are capable of being our CEO.
[1975.03s -> 1979.75s]  Some you find easier to work within others but they are all good people. Why are you speaking
[1979.75s -> 1989.38s]  like in like second person for me. It's weird. I am off to launch my search for Sean. I'll be in
[1989.38s -> 1997.34s]  like why is she reading a novel through my head. I'll be in touch as I can and you should and
[1997.34s -> 2003.74s]  you should also keep an eye out on your travels for my assistant Rick Lafontaine. If necessary
[2003.74s -> 2012.30s]  the rest of the board and I will be able to get messages to you through Rick. Right now you need
[2012.30s -> 2017.58s]  to go see my uncle Felix Baumeister in Cape Town. I think he's the best board member to begin with.
[2018.44s -> 2022.36s]  Also I understand that he's been working on some secret projects that may have a significant
[2022.36s -> 2029.29s]  impact on our business. I know you can do it silly Zonka Wonka. Good luck. All right we're making
[2029.93s -> 2037.88s]  wait is it we're spending 2500 bucks a week. Is that how much I'm making. I'm confused. All right
[2037.88s -> 2053.37s]  quest log. You're ready. Talk to Felix. Here we go. 447 bucks. I can't wait. I'm gonna sell the
[2053.37s -> 2065.46s]  hell out of this. All right talk to Felix. Where are we? If you're trying to find Felix head over
[2065.46s -> 2079.42s]  to Cape Town manufacturing. They sell. Oh my god sell all. About 21 000 dollars. Welcome to South
[2079.42s -> 2084.54s]  Africa silly Wonka Zonka. I'm hopeful that you will indeed be able to steer our company through
[2084.54s -> 2090.90s]  these rough modern waters. While the war was raging I've been experimenting here with this
[2090.90s -> 2095.45s]  old chocolate factory. You see I love chocolate as much as the next guy but my latest passion is
[2095.45s -> 2100.07s]  coffee. It's my personal belief that coffee and coffee products represent a new frontier for our
[2100.07s -> 2105.70s]  company. I just need a bit more time to iron out the kinks of these coffee machines. You need to
[2105.70s -> 2109.22s]  keep expanding your repertoire of chocolate offerings and building up your business while
[2109.22s -> 2114.58s]  making coffee. In the meantime would you do something for me? Grab some peanuts from the
[2114.58s -> 2118.81s]  market here in Cape Town. Make 20 cases of chocolate bars with peanuts and deliver them
[2118.81s -> 2133.00s]  to Florian Amiel at University of Zurich. 20. Okay I can eat. I eat peanuts. I will. Look at
[2133.00s -> 2138.92s]  peanuts. Almonds. Holy shit peanuts are so expensive. What does it take to. I don't have
[2138.92s -> 2155.58s]  to. Wait haggle. Wait how do I get out? I can't leave? Okay wait there we go. Where are my recipes?
[2155.58s -> 2168.68s]  Chocolate bars with peanuts. Okay so it's sugar. There's no milk. That's good. So I just need. I
[2168.68s -> 2177.14s]  need like 100 sacks. All right I need 100. No I don't. I need like how many do you want? 10 cases?
[2177.14s -> 2190.57s]  20 cases. I need 20. I need 20 cases. 20 sacks. Let's haggle. Haggle. Did you have something to
[2190.57s -> 2195.74s]  chat about? Are you joking? These prices are insane. I'm not asking for lots but I want
[2195.74s -> 2200.44s]  you to do something about your prices. Is it me or are your prices way out of line compared to
[2200.44s -> 2204.36s]  other places? I'm gonna buy from you. I'm just hoping you might be able to help a tad with your
[2204.36s -> 2215.16s]  prices. Imagine walking into a place. Is it me or are you. What do you mean is it you? Are you talking
[2215.16s -> 2222.58s]  to a bunch of people in the market? Trying to get everybody on board? Is it just me or are these
[2222.58s -> 2226.66s]  prices out of line compared to other places? Waiting for someone to be like yeah it is a little
[2226.66s -> 2236.50s]  expensive. It is a little expensive isn't it? Got it. Since I'm in such a good mood today I'll cut
[2236.50s -> 2243.08s]  you a deal. That's a pretty good deal. Last seen in Cape Town for 86 per sack. Let's, we need,
[2243.08s -> 2249.70s]  I should buy a shitload of them then if I got a deal. Should I just buy $15,000 worth of peanuts?
[2249.70s -> 2262.20s]  They don't go bad do they? Wait can I just take these and sell them? Ow that hurt. Can I just
[2262.20s -> 2269.99s]  take these and sell them in a different like country? Could I immediately get 80 like $5?
[2271.10s -> 2286.23s]  Haggle more. Okay you're nuts if you think I'll buy anything at these prices and I like look
[2286.23s -> 2293.29s]  around and I like wink at everybody because I'm buying peanuts. He didn't like that okay.
[2295.03s -> 2302.68s]  All right all right all right fine fine fine. Okay let's do 50. No I could afford 100.
[2303.24s -> 2306.76s]  Let's just, I'll do 100. That's a lot of money. It's a big investment.
[2307.32s -> 2318.74s]  Okay bring 20 cases of chocolate bars with peanuts. So we have the ingredients. Anything else I can
[2318.74s -> 2327.24s]  do here? Now that you're CEO candidate you'll be able to haggle at shops and markets. Be careful
[2327.24s -> 2331.24s]  though. If you say the right thing haggling can result in better prices but you can also insult
[2331.24s -> 2340.70s]  merchants and cause their prices to move the wrong way too. All right all right we don't want to
[2340.70s -> 2349.29s]  spend too much money. Let's go back. Let's make the chocolate with peanuts and make 100 million
[2349.29s -> 2360.82s]  dollars. I can sell these too. Penis is expensive. What are you talking about? All right let's make
[2360.82s -> 2368.79s]  let's make a few sales huh? I get 18 cases here. Look at that. Let's do it. Oh fuck I could haggle.
[2369.61s -> 2376.97s]  Wait hey hey can I have that back? Give me that back please. I'd like a refund.
[2377.85s -> 2382.89s]  Oh you'd like to return? You'd like a refund? Yeah I'd like to. Let's cancel that transaction please.
[2382.89s -> 2386.74s]  Hey can we do it again? But I'd love to do business with you. Your prices are ridiculous.
[2386.74s -> 2394.10s]  God damn it. All right how do I make the peanuts? This is what they're making right now. Change that
[2394.10s -> 2400.92s]  recipe. I want to make peanuts. Chocolate bars with peanuts. Use this one. Good luck. All right I gotta
[2400.92s -> 2409.45s]  make this one good. Mr. Green returns. So this is just peanut. Here we go. I'm gonna try to do this
[2409.45s -> 2435.00s]  fast. Recycle. Don't. Good good good good good good good good good. He's gonna speed it up on me.
[2435.00s -> 2453.19s]  He's speeding up. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. More more more more more more more more.
[2454.07s -> 2466.38s]  More more. Oh fuck I keep thinking that's the end. Imagine like a guy in a factory
[2467.18s -> 2478.02s]  sitting there screaming that. It's like we can only go so fast. More more more.
[2478.74s -> 2491.34s]  More. He's on a PA system too. He's not even he's not even down there. He's up with the glass wall
[2491.34s -> 2514.98s]  looking down. That guy's a fucking asshole. Does he know that these machines are automated?
[2515.62s -> 2520.30s]  Like which maintaining the machines we're making sure everything works you know.
[2521.34s -> 2526.57s]  We can only set it to go at a certain speed. What does he think we're doing?
[2526.57s -> 2540.34s]  18 a week. We need more. We need more gas. All right I'm gonna get 18. How many? I need 20k. Ah shit.
[2540.60s -> 2551.21s]  Whatever. Enough ingredients for four weeks. He starts like playing like the Pee Wee Herman music
[2551.21s -> 2557.98s]  for the PA. And it's like oh this guy this guy doesn't fucking get it. That's gonna come through
[2557.98s -> 2579.02s]  really like garbled and shitty. Like this guy's doing the shit like that. Like the fucking
[2579.02s -> 2589.26s]  grandfather would do that. You like this song? He leans in to do that. He's the one doing that
[2589.26s -> 2608.46s]  with his mouth. Oh doy doy doy. Why? All right I gotta wait. Can I do anything else in the meantime?
[2609.02s -> 2622.54s]  I have oh with peanuts. I have eight. That's it? What week is it? What day is it? How many do I have?

[2651.66s -> 2656.22s]  My dear friend Felix Baumeister told me to expect something sweet. Do you have any idea what he might
[2656.22s -> 2663.21s]  have been talking about? I have chocolate all over my mouth. An empty container of chocolates.
[2663.21s -> 2670.60s]  And I go I don't know what I don't know. Here's a card that he sent you. It's like that's classic

[2827.90s -> 2832.30s]  You've made my day simply zonkawonka. Do you know how hard it was to get a hold of peanuts during
[2832.30s -> 2837.38s]  the war? These chocolates are simply delightful. Did I know you didn't give me any money? Do
[2837.38s -> 2841.22s]  yourself a favor. Take another 30 cases of these delightful chocolate bars of peanuts
[2841.22s -> 2848.74s]  to Duduzail Nikosi in Cape Town. You can find her up on the Table Mountain. I know she'll love
[2848.74s -> 2860.58s]  the chocolates and she's usually up on the latest news. How many how many do I have? How many do I
[2860.58s -> 2869.88s]  have? Oh I need more. I don't have enough peanuts. You're just this is a front for you smuggling

[2886.87s -> 2902.41s]  Why? This trip will take you spend a week in an airplane teleportation. This is the 1940s. Oh
[2906.33s -> 2913.77s]  I yeah that would take a while. It's 1940. Yeah okay I don't know why I figured it was like today.
[2913.77s -> 2917.90s]  They had planes. Yeah they had planes but the planes had like I don't know the planes have
[2917.90s -> 2922.15s]  the same technology that has the whirly thing on the top of the comedy hat. It's like the same
[2922.15s -> 2937.93s]  technology they had. All right where is this? Cape Town. Okay so I should get more chocolate right?
[2937.93s -> 2947.06s]  34. Table Mountain. Delicious. Listen I understand that Verena Zubriggen has been stalking all kinds
[2947.06s -> 2957.05s]  of new ingredients. I imagine you may just find some new useful things on your next visit. I just
[2957.05s -> 2968.22s]  got a tip and I didn't even fucking pay attention. I just that's so much that I just that was like
[2968.22s -> 2977.53s]  ten twenty thousand dollars. What did they just say? What did they what did they just say? I just
[2977.53s -> 2982.58s]  was staring at that person with my mouth open and they told me something very important that I just
[2982.58s -> 2988.26s]  got back on the plane. I wasn't even paying attention. What was it? I wasn't paying attention
[2988.26s -> 3003.37s]  either. What did what what did the game just say? Nobody had to have been paying attention to what
[3003.37s -> 3017.13s]  the game said. I was tabbed out. What? Tab back in and help. Go to the factory. This the factory here?
[3017.13s -> 3029.35s]  Oh oh no it said buy ingredients. Hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[3029.35s -> 3033.70s]  wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. You're just the person I've been looking for. I
[3033.70s -> 3039.45s]  happen to have a glut of sugar. I'm trying to offload. I'd be willing to exchange a thousand
[3039.45s -> 3045.50s]  sacks of sugar for a mere 18 cases of chocolate bars with mint. Does that make a deal? Let's make
[3045.50s -> 3056.25s]  a deal. Oh I have to buy the mint from you. Oh I see but this is so I have to like just buy mint
[3056.25s -> 3062.62s]  from you and come back and and you give me all your sugar. What you meant to say is you have a
[3062.62s -> 3068.94s]  glut of mint and you don't care about the sugar because it's so cheap. So you're going to mind
[3068.94s -> 3073.99s]  game me into buying a shitload of the expensive herb from you to then think that I'm going to
[3073.99s -> 3079.90s]  come back and get a lot of the cheap thing that you don't care about. Well uh do I look like a
[3079.90s -> 3092.52s]  fool? He wants 18 cases. Well I think we can make some money with this so I'm going to get 30 cases.
[3093.90s -> 3105.94s]  No more than that. Let's make some mint. 50 cases. No enough for two weeks and I'm usually around
[3105.94s -> 3116.33s]  18 15 to 18. Let's just say like 40 cases. Okay how much sugar do I have? While I'm here I might
[3116.33s -> 3133.18s]  as well get some milk. Last seen 32 to 42 89 to 111. That's no that's expensive. Hazelnuts 152

[3165.32s -> 3179.14s]  Come back and get a thousand. This is running out. What the hell is this? This is a guy on the plane
[3179.14s -> 3184.97s]  sitting next to me. Agiling is tricky but buying low and selling high is the secret to success and
[3184.97s -> 3199.08s]  the confections business. Silly zonkawonga. Thank you. Why is that guy like slug-worthing me? Get
[3199.08s -> 3202.68s]  out of here. I don't care about you. You're like weird. He's gonna tempt me with something later.
[3202.68s -> 3207.99s]  He's gonna be like let me tell you something. How about you sell it to me? Sell the company to me

[3348.94s -> 3352.30s]  ingredients on hand to keep the machinery running while you travel so they can continue to produce
[3352.30s -> 3356.30s]  chocolates for you to sell. Throw your mouse over the factory status window below to find out where
[3356.30s -> 3365.94s]  to buy the ingredients you need. Ooh I got a trophy. Chocolate Historical Society's up and cum
[3365.94s -> 3371.62s]  cummer cup. Presented to a budding chocolatier who has arrived with a big splash on the chocolate
[3371.62s -> 3378.38s]  making scene. Oh thanks. All right here we go. Horrific these chocolate bars are mint are perfect.

[10304.95s -> 10313.13s]  is going to be a dark cream a nice dark cuban coffee color like that with the richness falling
[10313.13s -> 10318.82s]  to the bottom of the glass should it be the tv static yeah i want the richness falling to the
[10318.82s -> 10333.10s]  bottom this is the beer you send back at the bar because the pour was horrible right there perfect
