[575.13s -> 580.07s]  have a party anyways we recommend choosing an island that has the same seasonal pattern as your
[580.07s -> 589.53s]  current home current home why the fuck am i doing that so tell me jeremy where do you live now i
[589.53s -> 595.85s]  live in north america ah excellent that information really helps us focus on just the right island for
[595.85s -> 601.42s]  you naturally we'd recommend that you relocate to an island in the northern hemisphere there are
[601.42s -> 607.24s]  a few more decisions to make but does that sound okay to you so far so far oh okay if i do that
[607.24s -> 613.30s]  again i want i want everyone to leave if i do that again everyone leave watch another stream if i do
[613.30s -> 626.58s]  that again okay here we go there are a few inches should i go to southern hemisphere uh no i want
[626.58s -> 633.77s]  to stay here we have a number of lovely uninhabited islands in the northern hemisphere to choose from
[633.77s -> 638.17s]  now then all of our islands are approximately the same size and they're all quite natural
[638.17s -> 641.85s]  but don't worry about whether you'll have enough space or comfort you can't go wrong
[642.57s -> 645.93s]  just follow your instincts and choose an island with a layout that looks appealing that's how i
[645.93s -> 651.86s]  do it oh look at how cute this is i'll show you some maps now and you can choose the best one
[651.86s -> 678.87s]  for your new home um okay which one do i want a penis one um these okay these all could be

[1849.75s -> 1855.43s]  is a game that came out within the last week the first time i played a new game in probably a year
[1856.07s -> 1861.08s]  this is the first game time i played a game that came out after 2006 and probably like a year and
[1861.08s -> 1865.90s]  a half um so they're probably just going to be coming looking for animal crossing gameplay and
[1865.90s -> 1869.74s]  like i'm fucked up so i'm going to like tone it down a little bit from here on out
[1874.47s -> 1880.15s]  all right everyone let's get to it literally yesterday city skylines came out in like 2007
[1880.15s -> 1887.46s]  when did it come out 2010 would you come see me for a moment well i could walk up there what
[1887.46s -> 1896.55s]  are you like a judge oh jeremy i just wanted to go over what we'll need for the campfire
[1897.59s -> 1901.27s]  i think roughly 10 tree branches to do the trick and find them scattered about the island
[1904.44s -> 1909.51s]  when you find one lying in the ground press y to pick it up we will i'll investigate the peach
[1909.51s -> 1924.38s]  like items growing in the trees i suspect they're real peaches how did you get to the top oh any
[1924.38s -> 1928.94s]  tree branches you find on the ground or shake out of the trees will work just fine come on it
[1934.82s -> 1951.56s]  yep i just want to make sure i have these first quest free branch got it one two three four five
[1953.53s -> 1980.70s]  rock give it to me take the trees wow six seven eight nine ten done i get it should i click the
[1980.70s -> 1990.74s]  peaches and stuff or no i got them welcome back i trust you had some success foraging for tree
[1990.74s -> 1998.18s]  branches very well allow me to lighten your load yes that should be plenty for our campfire you
[1998.18s -> 2002.18s]  made quick work of that i'm quite glad that i'll be sharing this desolate island with such a hard
[2002.18s -> 2008.17s]  worker oh ho i think if you're surviving on a desolate island our next task is to run up
[2008.17s -> 2011.93s]  something to snack on while you were collecting branches i was evaluating the fruit that seems
[2011.93s -> 2016.17s]  to be abundant here they look like peaches they smell like peaches and they even taste like peaches
[2016.97s -> 2021.29s]  in fact they are 100 without a doubt genuine peaches so will you collect six of them for me
[2024.28s -> 2028.04s]  if you see a tree growing peaches you can press a to shake it and then pick up the fruit
[2028.92s -> 2032.28s]  i need peaches for us in no time we're gonna sit at a campfire and eat peaches
[2033.16s -> 2045.90s]  this is such a great saturday morning children's cartoon i can't wait that is the perfect quest
[2046.94s -> 2066.47s]  for wait what oh i just wait is six seven eight nine bug because what i've been saying

[2128.81s -> 2134.49s]  ventures and endeavors over the years but this may be the most exciting helping develop a thriving
[2134.49s -> 2140.09s]  new community entirely from scratch will truly test my business acumen okay now please if you
[2140.09s -> 2145.05s]  would pass this chalice around and drink from the blood and it's like you have to pass it around a
[2145.05s -> 2153.46s]  fucking blood chalice and perhaps my skills as an outdoorsman now we may not have the kind of
[2153.46s -> 2160.12s]  numbers that i originally envisioned that just means we'll have to rise to the challenge and
[2160.12s -> 2164.36s]  i have no doubt that with hard work and perseverance we'll shape this deserted island into
[2166.36s -> 2170.28s]  i suppose we can't call this a deserted island anymore what would should we call it
[2170.84s -> 2180.76s]  i just rang the back of his head and well that was weird i sense a great opportunity
[2181.56s -> 2183.72s]  as the first residence this island we should be the ones to name it
[2184.92s -> 2191.06s]  and in the spirit of democracy we should put it to evoke majority rules i told you this is my
[2191.06s -> 2202.14s]  competition you guys didn't say so present your ideas just a name for the island uh about um

[7900.42s -> 7905.62s]  magic happens watering opens up the possibility of propagating and cross breeding your flowers
[7905.62s -> 7919.40s]  to develop rare colors and how might you water them well i've already have already my accountant
[7919.40s -> 7930.41s]  warned me about giving this sort of thing away for free i already bought it here takes another

[7975.98s -> 7982.63s]  i told you how many precisely you asked well there's no way of knowing just yet but i have
[7982.63s -> 7991.06s]  received let's see five outstanding specimens so far oh seriously well that is very exciting
[7991.06s -> 7997.50s]  oh but you'll have to excuse me i'm with the customer right now i'm so sorry to keep you
[7997.50s -> 8003.58s]  waiting that was my friend blathers one who curates a museum believe it or not he's going
[8003.58s -> 8007.50s]  to come to our island to help us identify and preserve the local creatures i could use your
[8007.50s -> 8014.15s]  help jeremy as you've done so much scouting and collecting would you be able to help find a spot
[8014.15s -> 8020.33s]  for blathers need a good size space to really build out a world-class museum so do that keep
[8020.33s -> 8024.89s]  that in mind going down to the beach everything is going on the beach because i will always know
[8024.89s -> 8030.73s]  where the fuck it is i'm never gonna have to open the map it'll just be whatever it is it'll be on
[8030.73s -> 8055.77s]  the beach somewhere i want to i can craft some shit can i oh look at this log stakes what are

[8115.96s -> 8120.22s]  could be better well that wasn't actually a rhetorical question let me be more specific how
[8120.22s -> 8127.83s]  is that tent treating you that could be better sorry to hear that no one ever said that developing
[8127.83s -> 8131.99s]  an island paradise would be easy we don't do things because they are easy we do them because
[8131.99s -> 8138.49s]  they are profitable well yes i suppose the time is right to discuss the possibility of building a
[8138.49s -> 8143.05s]  custom house now there are certain challenges to building fabulous homes and remote locations such
[8143.05s -> 8149.37s]  as this challenges that do translate directly into costs i'm afraid with zero interest financing
[8149.37s -> 8154.92s]  an extremely lax repayment plan anything is possible so terribly if you ever find yourself
[8154.92s -> 8161.64s]  interested in a new home do come see me one more thing we have a miles redemption service for nook
[8161.64s -> 8166.68s]  miles you've collected you access the nook stop you'll be able to redeem your miles lots of

[8261.32s -> 8264.60s]  now building house means tagging out a new loan in the amount of 98 000

[12845.34s -> 12857.32s]  websites where you could redeem points for shit it was like 500 million points like an ipad oh
[12857.32s -> 12862.44s]  i want to ask something uh i saw something on tv about this website where you can buy like tvs for
[12862.44s -> 12867.64s]  like five cents and shit they were like auction weird like fucked up website where it's like i
[12867.64s -> 12876.18s]  got this plasma tv for 98 percent off how does how does that work how is that even possible it's
[12876.18s -> 12890.66s]  just a way it can't be real it's like i got this i i got this ipad pro for only three dollars it's
[12890.66s -> 12902.17s]  just like a weird penny auction sites you have to you pay regardless if you win you're the one you're
[12902.17s -> 12913.75s]  the 10,000th person to log in you don't actually pay three dollars you pay for bids so wait so if
[12913.75s -> 12926.84s]  i pay like 50 dollars to bid three cents then i won a you pay to bid so i i pay a hundred dollars
[12926.84s -> 12941.80s]  to bid 10 cents on this ipad pro so if i bid five times i paid for the ipad pro why would anyone
[12941.80s -> 12954.28s]  ever ever do that for any reason can you actually get something for like a dollar it's impossible
[12954.28s -> 12963.08s]  it's just gambling they take your bid even if you fail to win i was so confused i was like how does
[12963.08s -> 12973.83s]  it make any fucking sense because idiots like you aren't sure if it's real what hold on whoa hit the
[12973.83s -> 12979.99s]  brakes here for a second pump the brakes i said this is bullshit this is that's fucking impossible
