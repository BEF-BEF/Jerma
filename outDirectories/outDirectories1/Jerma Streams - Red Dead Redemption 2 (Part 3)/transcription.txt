[1.78s -> 7.91s]  Let's open it up. There it is. Let me just make this different.
[7.91s -> 11.19s]  So I have a confession to make here, and I'm sorry to all the people that were
[11.19s -> 19.30s]  expecting it. Zero playing off stream. I played a little bit off stream. I did
[19.30s -> 22.34s]  some side stuff, because it was just, I just couldn't stream with my internet,
[22.34s -> 25.78s]  obviously. And I'm not sure how much longer we're going to get of being
[25.78s -> 28.74s]  green. So by the way, just want to make sure I say this.
[28.74s -> 32.90s]  See you soon. Thanks for watching everybody. It's been
[32.98s -> 36.90s]  pretty fun stream so far, but this might just go to zero because it just does
[36.90s -> 42.87s]  that at like seven o'clock. So I did do some stuff off the
[42.87s -> 48.15s]  camera here. Let's go ahead and get it on the screen. There it is.
[48.15s -> 57.18s]  And I can go like this. All right, so where were we? I did one
[57.18s -> 63.82s]  mission where I unlocked the fence. I'm an idiot. Let me just update
[63.82s -> 72.18s]  this. RdRd2. RdR2. I can't, what do I think? A title for this.
[72.18s -> 78.87s]  What should I title? It takes me like the amount of time to create a
[78.87s -> 83.29s]  character in a game. To make a title in a game. Just do the boring
[83.29s -> 85.93s]  stuff off stream. That was kind of the idea.
[85.93s -> 89.77s]  Was to make a little bit of money, do some hunting, and trade some stuff,
[89.77s -> 96.39s]  make some money, pay off my bounties, and now here we are ready to play.
[96.39s -> 104.55s]  Okay, how about RdRd, how about just Red Dead Redemption gameplay?
[104.55s -> 110.78s]  Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay only. 480p. Am I trying to get people to
[110.78s -> 123.94s]  not come here? I don't understand. Am I trying to just lose everybody?
[123.94s -> 133.80s]  How about Red Dead, how about RdR2? No gameplay. Only commentary.
[133.88s -> 154.12s]  That's worse. How about, I'm just doing RdRd2 continue. Done.
[154.12s -> 159.62s]  Horseball stream. Oh Red Dead Redemption, okay.
[159.62s -> 165.32s]  I got it. Boring title. Whatever. Don't you guys know, don't ever judge a
[165.32s -> 171.08s]  book by its cover. Open up the first chapter and read it.
[171.08s -> 174.66s]  The Reddit Redemption. Alright, so here we go. Let's uh,
[174.66s -> 179.14s]  let's open her up. Wait, hold on a minute. My microphone is
[179.14s -> 183.38s]  synced up. Okay. Just making sure I was synced.
[183.38s -> 186.50s]  Make sure the audio here is telling me. Make sure we do this now.
[186.50s -> 190.02s]  You should be hearing Lethal League ball hit every time I go
[190.02s -> 205.70s]  duh duh duh. Okay, I'm ready. I did get another horse too by the way.
[205.70s -> 210.74s]  Just go, just go. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[210.74s -> 213.86s]  Those of you that were here for Lethal League and you are, don't want to be
[213.86s -> 217.78s]  spoiled, you don't want to see anymore. Every streamer plays Red Dead
[217.78s -> 220.50s]  Redemption 2, every single one, I understand.
[220.50s -> 231.45s]  Thanks for coming. See you soon. Uh, where's my horse over here?
[231.45s -> 236.07s]  Toy Story Woody's Adventure. Oh, I can't.
[236.07s -> 240.06s]  I can't take him to camp, that's right. Let me figure out what I want to do.
[240.06s -> 245.74s]  Let's go. There's a loan shark mission over here.
[245.74s -> 250.18s]  This looks like a, let's go to Maryland. That sounds like a plan. Oh
[250.18s -> 258.22s]  no. Hmm. Don't ask that you get Micah out of
[258.22s -> 262.38s]  the gym. Yeah, we've been on this one. Let's go to this one.
[262.46s -> 271.90s]  Just do it. We were, that was a story mission
[271.90s -> 281.03s]  like six hours ago. I think it's time to do it.
[281.03s -> 283.35s]  This is a different horse. Yes, it's because I stabled the other one because
[283.35s -> 287.43s]  I didn't want to get too fatigued. Those of you that can see what
[287.43s -> 290.87s]  happened when a gamer or a horse, it doesn't matter if you're a
[290.87s -> 294.39s]  human, everybody gets gamer fatigue. It happens.
[294.39s -> 299.35s]  What's this horse's name? The horse's name is Thunder.
[299.35s -> 303.64s]  I don't know, I was eating. I had fucking like a bowl of spaghetti in one
[303.64s -> 308.06s]  hand. I just did the easiest thing I can think of.
[308.06s -> 311.66s]  Whisper's still fine, yeah. Whisper's around still.
[311.66s -> 325.61s]  Just stabled. Oh my god, we got an event over here.
[325.61s -> 334.68s]  Please, anyone. Okay, what's what's up? You all right?
[343.26s -> 347.66s]  Medicine or a siphon? Suck out the venom.
[348.92s -> 353.72s]  That's an option. Then you know what? This doesn't work. This doesn't work.
[361.66s -> 364.38s]  No, it doesn't. I saw I saw like a clickbait YouTube video that said it
[364.38s -> 371.93s]  didn't work. You saved my life. You're gonna give me
[371.93s -> 381.90s]  money or something? All right, money. Treasure map. Family
[381.90s -> 395.38s]  platinum jewel. That's it. Keep your eyes on the ground.
[395.38s -> 401.38s]  Let's go. That's it. All right, fine.
[401.38s -> 407.46s]  Fine. I saved, yeah I know I saved him, but doesn't he like give me
[407.46s -> 410.62s]  something in return? You gotta have like something in your
[410.62s -> 416.07s]  pocket, man. All right, yeah, he'll show up later.
[416.07s -> 426.58s]  We're good. Greedy streamer wants... oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[426.58s -> 429.96s]  we got a loan shark mission right here.
[429.96s -> 435.51s]  I gotta collect the debt from somebody. First of all,
[435.51s -> 443.05s]  put the bow away? Give me like the shotgun. No no no no no no no no no
[443.05s -> 446.76s]  listen. Okay, give me the double-barred
[446.76s -> 450.82s]  shotgun. Don't bark. Don't bark. Don't bark.
[450.82s -> 455.98s]  These loan sharking missions you have to go collect. What why would you
[455.98s -> 459.59s]  put... what are you doing? What the hell was that?
[459.59s -> 466.97s]  I didn't do that. Okay, let's find him. Usually they've run.
[466.97s -> 473.30s]  I'm here to collect. Hey, looking for someone?
[473.30s -> 479.69s]  I am actually. Ah, who's this then? These cards is the only world team
[479.69s -> 485.16s]  we're likely to meet. You're asking the wrong feller.
[485.16s -> 491.40s]  Okay, the outside? They're just playing poker. Where's the
[491.40s -> 497.85s]  actual dude? Let's explore the area. Eventually we'll find him.
[500.09s -> 506.20s]  There you are. Do you smoke sir? This is not a loan shark.
[506.20s -> 509.64s]  Not as much as you. Oh no no don't worry about these. Actually
[509.64s -> 512.76s]  let me take some. Smoking and other hobbies. Oh thank you.
[512.76s -> 516.36s]  What are all the cigarettes for? Were you heading on a long journey or
[516.36s -> 518.52s]  something? No no no nothing like that at all.
[518.52s -> 521.96s]  I'm just interested in the cards. Okay. Cigarette cards.
[521.96s -> 525.40s]  Oh you got me? Yeah. Oh this is okay. Let me take a look. Come on. I actually have
[525.40s -> 528.12s]  quite a few of these, don't I? Yeah, I'll pay a good price.
[528.20s -> 533.08s]  Okay. Ah, nothing I haven't got. Oh bullshit. The value isn't
[533.08s -> 536.92s]  completing the debt. Sometimes I'll smoke up to 200 cigarettes in one day
[536.92s -> 539.64s]  just so I can keep opening the packs. I wish I could explain to you the
[539.64s -> 542.52s]  pleasure and the pain I get out of collecting these babies.
[542.52s -> 547.56s]  Sure, well it sounds thrilling. Yeah it is. Not to mention the vast
[547.56s -> 550.52s]  amounts of life-reaffirming cigarettes I get to smoke.
[550.52s -> 553.88s]  Oh. Sucking poison doesn't work. You get it on your mouth and it goes in
[553.88s -> 556.84s]  your bloodstream, see?
[570.84s -> 572.84s]  Meow meows.
[583.88s -> 589.96s]  There's so much side content in this game.
[589.96s -> 598.20s]  It's insane. There's so much to do.
[598.20s -> 604.74s]  All this stuff just, you don't even have to do any of this.
[604.74s -> 608.71s]  It's wild. Collect all the cigarette cards and mail the completed sets to
[608.71s -> 613.08s]  Phineas. Well, so we're out of this way.
[613.72s -> 618.33s]  We're still, yeah, yeah, yeah. 12 cards, that's that.
[618.33s -> 629.48s]  Still on the trek to go to see Micah. Good, good, good, good. Don't run into the
[629.48s -> 636.25s]  train. That would be bad. It's nothing
[636.25s -> 646.01s]  impressive. It's still fun though. You've been
[646.01s -> 648.57s]  hunting in Red Dead Redemption 2 for the past week and hardly done any
[648.57s -> 653.14s]  story stuff. Yeah, it's a wild west is such a
[653.14s -> 656.50s]  great setting. There's so much cool shit in this
[656.58s -> 660.58s]  time period that like it's surprising that not more
[660.58s -> 668.89s]  people try to do it. I definitely have to try to like
[668.89s -> 672.20s]  road rage somewhere. Well, we actually have to go this
[672.20s -> 677.70s]  way. We could use a BAP too. The horse is
[677.70s -> 694.90s]  kind of dirty. Wild West VR game. That actually
[694.90s -> 699.27s]  might get my attention. You would actually probably sit me
[699.27s -> 704.63s]  down for 45 minutes straight. What the fuck are you doing?
[704.71s -> 712.49s]  These pigs? These dogs? Oh boy!
[722.09s -> 730.26s]  Oh dogs everywhere!
[732.01s -> 752.22s]  Is there another one? There's another one! Oh, what the fuck was that for?
[752.22s -> 764.20s]  Okay, one hit and I was dead there. Damn. Leave him alone. Rip horse.
[764.20s -> 774.30s]  Horses. The horse is fine. Poor. Well, these are going to be worth nothing.
[774.30s -> 781.27s]  It's because I ran into a rock. Oh, I have the pelt on me. Come here.
[781.27s -> 789.96s]  The car is dead. Stop running into shit and come over here.
[789.96s -> 795.66s]  It's definitely not even worth taking these. I've shot so many holes in them.
[795.66s -> 800.68s]  No, forget it. I mean, maybe it's worth it for the meat.
[800.68s -> 814.94s]  Okay, I can cook the meat. I'll take it. Why did I kill the wild autos?
[815.42s -> 818.62s]  Because the wild auto is all ganged up on me
[818.62s -> 829.46s]  and tried to kill me at the same time. The game meat.
[829.46s -> 838.01s]  I can sell that. I use it. What's this guy's problem?
[838.01s -> 843.70s]  Oh, is he mad about the wolves?
[844.58s -> 850.47s]  Where the hell is this? Is this the same road, man? What, I'm not allowed to
[850.47s -> 872.60s]  take the same highway as you? Good morning. All right, let's go.
[872.68s -> 880.07s]  Let me first want to drop and gets the gold. Why?
[880.07s -> 905.51s]  Why is this happening? It's an ambush. Okay, are these guys in the wolves
[905.51s -> 911.86s]  working together? Seriously, do they send their like
[911.86s -> 922.68s]  World of Warcraft fucking pets at me first? I don't understand.
[922.68s -> 925.88s]  Everybody wants to be dead. I paid off on my bounties too. What's up with
[925.88s -> 935.67s]  this? You're good. Let's get some free stuff.
[936.97s -> 940.71s]  Probably old Drew. That guy had five dollars. Damn.
[940.71s -> 952.84s]  Okay, this is a witness, right? He doesn't care. Good.
[952.84s -> 956.44s]  Sometimes they stop and they get very upset at you.
[956.44s -> 960.04s]  These guys have a decent amount of money. Gold wedding ring.
[960.04s -> 976.58s]  Where's this dead horse? These are random dudes. Five bucks.
[976.58s -> 985.02s]  Where's the dead horse? The horse is back there.
[985.02s -> 998.89s]  Let me feed mine. Up on the hill here.
[998.89s -> 1013.27s]  I don't see it on the minimap. Where are you horse?
[1013.27s -> 1032.78s]  Where the hell feed your house? Well, oh well.
[1032.78s -> 1042.22s]  It's back where you parked it. No, I didn't go. Did I go that far?
[1042.22s -> 1044.55s]  Let's just take a look back here because they were chasing me from like
[1044.55s -> 1050.70s]  over here. Okay, there they are. Are these the wolves?
[1050.70s -> 1058.70s]  Are these the wolves? Are you a horse? No, you're a wolf.
[1058.70s -> 1062.94s]  Well, well, let's go. I ain't gonna search around for it.
[1062.94s -> 1070.74s]  It's up on the hill where the horse was standing.
[1070.74s -> 1079.43s]  Wouldn't have to show up on the minimap. So many random things.
[1079.43s -> 1096.86s]  So many random things. Come on, man. Hey, what's up?
[1096.86s -> 1101.74s]  You scared me. Boiled Satan? Yeah, I get that a lot.
[1101.74s -> 1104.78s]  What? What do you mean? What's that you got there?
[1104.78s -> 1108.46s]  You ain't interested in no scrap paper. It's nothing.
[1108.46s -> 1113.02s]  Just something for wiping. He'll freak out. He doesn't know where I am.
[1113.02s -> 1131.70s]  Well, I guess to go now. What? Hey, why the hurry?
[1131.70s -> 1142.23s]  Animal cruelty? What? This guy's an animal?
[1142.23s -> 1148.49s]  What? Hold on. I got his map. Animal cruelty. You've acquired a map
[1148.49s -> 1151.61s]  leading to a treasure that is rumored to be cursed. Many have died looking
[1151.61s -> 1170.09s]  for it. Who's the witness to animal cruelty?
[1170.09s -> 1175.43s]  Crime reported. Oh, hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
[1175.43s -> 1180.09s]  They don't know the whole story there. That's absolute bullshit.
[1180.09s -> 1185.61s]  I was wildly, rabidly attacked by animals and I had to save myself.
[1185.61s -> 1189.61s]  I was going to be killed. This is actually a pretty good horse.
[1189.61s -> 1217.77s]  He's okay, right? Okay. New horse. I'm gonna get out of here now.
[1217.77s -> 1222.94s]  How far away are they? They're not gonna find me. I'm 50 miles ahead of you.
[1222.94s -> 1230.62s]  I shot a horse during a fight with bandits? Well, what am I supposed to
[1230.62s -> 1239.34s]  do about that? I'm getting bombarded by all sides.
[1239.34s -> 1246.76s]  Thunder's fine. Thunder's coming behind us. I need to claim this is my own, though.
[1246.76s -> 1253.86s]  I'm gonna go to Stables. Is there a stable down here?
[1253.86s -> 1257.14s]  Cruelty. Well, at least I got the map here.
[1257.14s -> 1261.30s]  I tried to be nice to him. He just didn't even have any of it.
[1261.30s -> 1273.46s]  Sometimes not just changing the mask. Gotta change clothes, too.
[1273.46s -> 1283.58s]  That would make sense. Another random encounter.
[1283.58s -> 1286.70s]  These guys don't care. I'm in bad sorts here. I took
[1286.70s -> 1290.30s]  a little jolt and have managed to get myself hopelessly lost.
[1290.30s -> 1294.78s]  I am staying in strawberry. If you could just guide me back.
[1294.78s -> 1300.87s]  You need to ride to strawberry. Okay. I think of a good reason to say no.
[1300.87s -> 1304.23s]  Lead the man to strawberry. Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir. You need a horse?
[1304.23s -> 1309.91s]  Well, after you. What possessed me to come out here, I'll never know.
[1309.91s -> 1315.45s]  Wait, I have to lead him? So this guy is just a guy following me now.
[1315.77s -> 1322.36s]  I have a horse he can get on. Natural. I'm just visiting.
[1322.36s -> 1325.64s]  He can borrow it. I'm from New York City, actually.
[1325.64s -> 1330.52s]  You don't say? Oh, yes. There was some talk at the country club about this
[1330.52s -> 1332.92s]  burgeoning little resort town called strawberry.
[1332.92s -> 1335.48s]  So I thought it might be quite the trip to see what all the fuss was.
[1335.48s -> 1339.56s]  Just an escort mission. I have to make a few investments while it was still undervalued.
[1339.56s -> 1347.13s]  Turns out I was made the fool. It's a town of splinters.
[1347.13s -> 1350.81s]  If you could call it much of a town at all, I'd hardly stepped off the carriage
[1350.81s -> 1354.73s]  and I'd taken an old place. Should I get off the horse?
[1354.73s -> 1358.97s]  I suppose some might call it charming. Let me tell you,
[1358.97s -> 1362.57s]  charm is not worth much these days. You show me a timber frame, Jack,
[1362.57s -> 1368.55s]  and I'll show you Broadway. Meanwhile, you have this mayor, a
[1368.55s -> 1373.99s]  quite intolerable blowhard. He doesn't usually do that.
[1373.99s -> 1378.15s]  The man's completely deluded. Well, I should give him some credit.
[1378.23s -> 1381.51s]  He must be quite the salesman. He didn't get me out here after all.
[1381.51s -> 1384.71s]  More fool me. Now I'm tromping through the leaves and the muck was up.
[1384.71s -> 1390.18s]  This horse likes me. Cowboy. No offense.
[1390.18s -> 1394.41s]  This horse bonded me faster than anybody else.
[1394.41s -> 1397.93s]  Please kill this guy. Why? I have no reason to kill this guy yet.
[1397.93s -> 1402.55s]  For what reason? Look, I'm not just a maniac.
[1402.55s -> 1406.07s]  I don't kill people for no reason. There has to be a reason behind it
[1406.07s -> 1416.36s]  every time. A lot of people coming out of here. I had no reason to kill the
[1417.16s -> 1421.75s]  map that he didn't give me when I asked it for.
[1421.75s -> 1427.11s]  What do you mean there wasn't a reason? I want your map. Give it to me.
[1427.11s -> 1431.45s]  I don't have anything. This guy's not going to hold out on me.
[1431.45s -> 1443.02s]  He has a nice hat. I don't like that hat. I don't think it would look good on me.
[1443.02s -> 1452.26s]  I don't think that hat would look good. He's got nice shoes.
[1452.26s -> 1456.98s]  Not nice enough. Why couldn't he just walk here by
[1456.98s -> 1459.54s]  himself? You seem quite the resourceful
[1459.62s -> 1462.66s]  sort, sir. I don't get it. If for some reason you couldn't just walk half a
[1462.66s -> 1465.46s]  mile. You may want to look into that
[1465.46s -> 1471.56s]  gabbing mayor. Something is definitely off with him.
[1471.56s -> 1475.78s]  Ask? Talk to the mayor. All right. Keep that in mind.
[1475.78s -> 1483.00s]  Got some intel on the mayor. Maybe stay in town for now.
[1483.00s -> 1488.30s]  I've been to Hard Place. Thanks anyway. This looks like a Skyrim town. This
[1488.30s -> 1497.27s]  looks like the first Skyrim town. Is that all we done? I think that's
[1500.70s -> 1512.22s]  Yeah, this is the very first Skyrim town. I don't need to follow him still, but I'm
[1512.22s -> 1517.10s]  kind of... I just kind of want to hear his
[1517.10s -> 1523.72s]  whole story. Hey, this is the whole town. It's probably stable here.
[1523.72s -> 1530.90s]  It actually is. Press O. No. Somebody already got me with that. I do have
[1530.90s -> 1533.38s]  stuff to sell with Butcher. This guy's done.
[1533.38s -> 1543.18s]  Congratulations. You win. Let me sell some of this shit.
[1543.26s -> 1552.44s]  All right, we got, we got... Not bad. Big game meat. I'll sell it all. Maybe not
[1552.44s -> 1555.80s]  all of it, because I can cook this. Get rid of the shitty
[1555.80s -> 1564.01s]  bird meat. Shitty rabbit pelt. Turkey feather. I'll keep the turkey
[1564.01s -> 1571.35s]  feather. I'll keep like five turkey feathers.
[1571.35s -> 1581.64s]  Big game meat. I need a stable. Is there a stable in this town?
[1581.64s -> 1594.79s]  There is no stable here. Well, that's just not good, is it?
[1594.79s -> 1602.10s]  Dammit. No stable? Well, here's one. A little outside of town. I was looking
[1602.10s -> 1609.43s]  in the town. I was just looking. I'm sorry. I was
[1609.43s -> 1613.35s]  paying attention to this.
[1613.59s -> 1622.46s]  Don't run him over, boys. What are you doing? Don't get up here.
[1622.46s -> 1627.37s]  I gotta talk to him like the freaks and geeks. Freak and weirdo.
[1645.00s -> 1652.36s]  To bring you the great news. The great news that you are saved today.
[1652.36s -> 1655.88s]  This even happens in that first level in Skyrim.
[1655.88s -> 1662.92s]  You guys are in the same spot. So we can spend eternity together.
[1662.92s -> 1670.86s]  They did. Hello, sir. Do you want to be saved?
[1670.86s -> 1675.80s]  Sure. Yes, desperately. Well, that's
[1675.80s -> 1684.44s]  wonderful news. You are. Come on. That's really all there is to it.
[1684.44s -> 1688.76s]  Just do more good things and less bad ones
[1688.76s -> 1693.16s]  and we can be together for all of eternity. What's wrong with this guy?
[1693.16s -> 1700.28s]  You and me. Am I gonna get married to these guys?
[1700.28s -> 1717.26s]  What? Great. Okay. I think that's all I can do with this guy.
[1717.34s -> 1726.84s]  Married now. Appreciate a little more room here. Rejoice. Push him. No,
[1726.84s -> 1730.92s]  I can't. I just cleared all my bounties. It was so expensive.
[1730.92s -> 1736.94s]  Together we shall light up paradise with a whole
[1736.94s -> 1740.06s]  Wait, that's not the horse I want. That's a great light
[1740.06s -> 1747.82s]  that shines from within about the great glories of life. Yes,
[1747.82s -> 1755.42s]  glories that I embody. You all thought I was gonna run right into him.
[1755.42s -> 1760.26s]  You thought I was gonna ram right into that guy, didn't you?
[1760.26s -> 1763.70s]  There's a time for living and there's a time
[1763.70s -> 1782.30s]  for dying and your time has come. Hey, I want a new horse. This one.
[1782.30s -> 1790.68s]  I'll stable you. Need a new name though, right?
[1790.68s -> 1795.40s]  All right, let's saddle this one up and I want to
[1795.40s -> 1803.85s]  change the name. Horse care package. Let's rename the horse.
[1803.85s -> 1807.77s]  What does the horse look like? We got like kind of navy blue.
[1807.77s -> 1824.28s]  Could be old navy. Old navy. What the fuck are these suggestions?
[1824.28s -> 1827.96s]  Bean bag sonic? It can't be bean bag sonic. That's to be like a horse
[1827.96s -> 1861.08s]  bag sonic. Why would it be bean bag? There. Okay. Upgrade. I got 320 bucks.
[1861.16s -> 1867.53s]  Let's see what's big. Saddles. What's on the back of sonic the hedgehog?
[1867.53s -> 1874.70s]  Is it red? Red spikes? What? White? It's white, right? It's blue. It's just, is it
[1874.70s -> 1893.59s]  blue? All blue. That's pretty close. Okay.
[1893.59s -> 1902.57s]  Got it on. I already own it. You have this item equipped already. Okay.
[1902.57s -> 1911.56s]  Saddle bags. Upgraded. Here's blue. 40 fucking dollars, man.
[1911.56s -> 1918.46s]  It's worth it. I know. That's what I just said.
[1918.46s -> 1926.74s]  Stirrups. Try to give them red shoes. I'll, I don't know if you can.
[1926.74s -> 1936.57s]  Corge rain rate. Bell stirrup. Any of these any better?
[1936.57s -> 1940.62s]  I mean, I already have. The bell stirrup does a better job. Yeah, just put the bell one on.
[1940.62s -> 1944.62s]  It's already equipped. Corge rain rate. It's higher, but
[1944.62s -> 1954.98s]  that's fine. Horns. This is the, this is the joystick.
[1954.98s -> 1963.08s]  Sock puppet? I think I want the sock puppet.
[1963.16s -> 1971.54s]  Diablo. Hmm. Yeah. We're going with sock puppet.
[1971.54s -> 1983.38s]  Blankets. I don't even need any of these. It's the one that I already have.
[1983.38s -> 1989.53s]  It's fine. Bedrolls. I don't think, can you do shoes?
[1989.53s -> 1995.24s]  No, this one's fine. All right. Grooming.
[1995.24s -> 2005.54s]  Main. We need long spikes. I mean, that's not even close. I get, that's
[2005.54s -> 2013.69s]  as close as it's gonna be though. Yeah, it has to be the white ones.
[2013.69s -> 2030.23s]  What? You guys don't have mobile? Why are you saying that?
[2030.23s -> 2034.98s]  Does he, the Sonic doesn't have a tail. No, he just, he's just blue.
[2034.98s -> 2040.46s]  That's fine. Okay, anything else that we can do?
[2040.46s -> 2043.42s]  No, I can't do anything with the shoes, right? Grooming. No.
[2043.42s -> 2048.55s]  Services. You could just do a care package.
[2048.55s -> 2055.29s]  Yeah, let's just like, let's care package to the horse. What's with the
[2055.29s -> 2062.15s]  blue mohawk? Then it's like, what? Yeah, what's
[2062.15s -> 2068.17s]  up with that? That's weird. Okay. All right, here's
[2068.17s -> 2073.11s]  Horsebag Sonic. A little bit slower than, uh,
[2073.11s -> 2077.88s]  no, at the moment it's a little faster than Thunder. I mean, Whisper's just too
[2077.88s -> 2079.96s]  good, but that's, that's like kind of cheating.
[2079.96s -> 2086.90s]  This is the, this is the you spent $20 horse. No.
[2086.90s -> 2096.28s]  All right, let's go. That's not even a white main.
[2096.28s -> 2105.37s]  Oh, it's the wrong lighting. All right, let's see how fast you can go.
[2105.37s -> 2109.05s]  Pretty fast, actually. Pretty fast. Back to, okay,
[2109.05s -> 2120.90s]  Micah. We were trying to get to Micah. Come on. Micah.
[2120.90s -> 2134.31s]  Hold down P. What do you mean P? Crazy fool. See, that was pretty cool.
[2134.31s -> 2147.26s]  All right, Micah. Time for a mission. Break Micah out of this prison, right?
[2147.26s -> 2160.42s]  Micah. In here? Horse hybrid. Hello, sir. I've, uh, I've come from
[2160.42s -> 2165.14s]  Blackwater. I'm on the trail of a dangerous gang,
[2165.14s -> 2168.66s]  Tomo Drisco. Heard you had some sort of incident.
[2168.66s -> 2172.98s]  No deal with bounty hunters around here, son. I was just wondering if I could
[2172.98s -> 2177.56s]  get a description. Well, they weren't friends. They got
[2177.56s -> 2180.84s]  in a fight, two men got killed. Now one of them's an idiot, the other's
[2180.84s -> 2184.12s]  some kind of dumb mix, so maybe them's your boys.
[2184.12s -> 2188.52s]  Can I get my bounty back? I already paid for it.
[2188.52s -> 2197.06s]  Thank you, Sheriff. I do need another outfit. I've been doing this same
[2197.14s -> 2206.36s]  outfit's been here for a while. Okay, locate and speak to Micah.
[2206.36s -> 2217.61s]  Do I have to sneak? Am I allowed back here? Arthur, Arthur.
[2217.61s -> 2221.77s]  Hello, old friend. Had a good time. Tagged on.
[2221.77s -> 2226.38s]  You going to get me out of here? I ain't decided yet.
[2226.38s -> 2233.58s]  Real fucking- Am I clean shaded? I've lost her out of your mouth these
[2233.58s -> 2238.63s]  last six months, and now the opportunity to watch you be
[2238.63s -> 2245.08s]  silent. Well, you gotta do something. I always looked up to you, Arthur.
[2245.08s -> 2251.86s]  You can pull this card. Listen, there's one little problem.
[2251.86s -> 2255.62s]  A town full of people wanting to see you swing.
[2255.62s -> 2267.40s]  You got to do something, Arthur. I do. So we have to find a way to free
[2267.40s -> 2271.74s]  Micah. Do I have to blow this building?
[2271.74s -> 2287.13s]  All right, hold on. Stand back. This wall just needs some good force.
[2287.13s -> 2290.33s]  Might want to step back.
[2293.50s -> 2297.42s]  I did it. Let's get out of here. Come on.
[2297.42s -> 2303.72s]  What the fuck is this guy? He wasn't O'Driscoll. What?
[2304.52s -> 2311.90s]  It worked. I'm just standing right here.
[2311.90s -> 2334.22s]  Out. Just driving around. What am I doing, man? I just used them.
[2334.22s -> 2341.32s]  Right? What the fuck would I do that for? There wasn't anybody- I just lit
[2341.32s -> 2348.97s]  another one. Throw it. Get it out of here quick. Get it out of here.
[2348.97s -> 2360.97s]  Wait, no. Wrong button. Okay, those of you that need to know,
[2360.97s -> 2367.69s]  if you press L2, it lights it. It lights it when you press L2.
[2367.69s -> 2377.27s]  Oh, fuck. Easy.
[2377.27s -> 2391.35s]  I didn't know that when you press L2, it just lights it up.
[2391.35s -> 2402.41s]  I got some deadeye here. Should I use it? Might as well. Was that just random
[2402.41s -> 2409.05s]  person? That might have been just random.
[2409.05s -> 2412.57s]  I want to loot all these people so bad.
[2415.34s -> 2425.94s]  All right, back to the shotgun here.
[2431.40s -> 2435.64s]  I got that- wait, I got this guy? How did I get that guy?
[2435.64s -> 2466.09s]  I think that camcorder fell down. I got cocaine?
[2480.25s -> 2490.20s]  All right, we don't need to clear this room. Do we need to clear the room?
[2490.20s -> 2494.58s]  Wanted. Slice. What the fuck is happening?
[2494.58s -> 2500.33s]  Oh my god, he just killed somebody in there.
[2500.97s -> 2504.86s]  We're wanted right now, we gotta go.
[2524.12s -> 2533.94s]  Oh, on the top? Nope, we're good. Hold on, just wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2533.94s -> 2547.50s]  I want to pick it- just wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna get at least like two
[2547.50s -> 2556.14s]  cigarettes off this guy. These are our horses. Nice. All right,
[2556.14s -> 2566.62s]  let's go. Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[2566.62s -> 2583.30s]  Okay, we're good. I can't shoot this guy. And I got off
[2583.30s -> 2586.82s]  the fucking horse. That's just wonderful, that wasn't it.
[2586.82s -> 2598.49s]  The horse is fucked up. The horse is injured. The horse is-
[2598.49s -> 2602.81s]  I'm on a fucking bonko. I'm on a fucking bronco.
[2602.81s -> 2608.58s]  Oh Jesus. Wait, wait, the horse- my horse is hurt.
[2608.58s -> 2622.71s]  I need to feed the horse. Drink this. Drink it. Drink. Have some.
[2622.71s -> 2638.30s]  Okay, you're good. That's a gun. Drink it.
[2638.30s -> 2643.58s]  No, I need something that's gonna refill your core here.
[2643.58s -> 2649.58s]  More stamina, of course health. I need some cores here.
[2649.58s -> 2665.14s]  There we go. Just eat it. There we go.
[2668.42s -> 2670.90s]  All right, we're good.
[2672.10s -> 2677.14s]  We have some gifted subs here from Kazzy, thank you Kazzy101.
[2677.14s -> 2682.90s]  For your five gifted subs. Thanks a lot man.
[2683.22s -> 2686.10s]  Thanks for your generosity.
[2687.85s -> 2691.10s]  Lightning.
[2697.53s -> 2704.92s]  I like the storm skyshift, it's pretty cool.
[2704.92s -> 2714.68s]  Kinda need to do this, right? With that stormy sky, looks good.
[2715.32s -> 2718.92s]  I think we finally lost them. I hope so.
[2718.92s -> 2722.76s]  I'm giving you a holster. My way of saying thank you.
[2722.76s -> 2728.52s]  And thank you. A holster? There I was having a dull day only for you.
[2728.52s -> 2732.28s]  To liven it up by letting me help you shoot up half a town.
[2732.28s -> 2735.72s]  You're a funny fella, Arthur. Real funny.
[2735.72s -> 2739.80s]  Why you act all sour all the time. Yeah well, you ain't funny at all. So why
[2739.80s -> 2742.44s]  you gotta act like the court jester? Right, listen.
[2742.44s -> 2746.36s]  I'm sorry, but we're family now. Arthur,
[2746.36s -> 2753.48s]  you and me. Son of a... I don't know about this guy. Makes us brothers.
[2753.48s -> 2759.24s]  Sometimes, brothers make mistakes. Now I'm heading back to my little camp
[2759.24s -> 2762.76s]  where I'm back a strawberry. Come see me. Can you get struck by
[2762.76s -> 2766.68s]  lightning in Red Dead Redemption 2? You ain't heading back to Dutch? No.
[2766.68s -> 2770.20s]  That would be hysterical. I ain't seeing Dutch
[2770.28s -> 2776.01s]  till I can bring him a peace offering. No, you cannot.
[2776.01s -> 2785.62s]  Are you kidding me? I mean, are they trying to make this the best game ever?
[2785.62s -> 2789.64s]  You can now own the offhand holster. This allows you to carry two sidearms at
[2789.64s -> 2795.70s]  once and dual wield them. Okay.
[2795.70s -> 2800.28s]  How are we doing? Sawed-off shotgun. So this is
[2800.28s -> 2806.74s]  dual wield. Oh man, that's cool. What does aiming do then? Is it both
[2806.74s -> 2814.34s]  of them at the same time? Committing serious crimes will cause
[2814.34s -> 2817.70s]  towns to go into lockdowns. This is shown by a red area in the pause
[2817.70s -> 2824.76s]  map. So we killed everybody in this town so
[2824.76s -> 2830.55s]  we can no longer use this town. Hold on, wait, wait, wait. I have a
[2830.55s -> 2836.97s]  bounty in here? $85. Well, that wasn't even my fault.
[2836.97s -> 2847.03s]  That's bullshit. Let's go. You dual wield.
[2847.03s -> 2864.12s]  Oh right, I forgot. I'm aiming the gun at people.
[2864.12s -> 2871.14s]  That guy doesn't have a face anymore. You can't just do that. Well, I was
[2871.70s -> 2876.58s]  checking the dual wield. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[2876.58s -> 2883.69s]  Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. You didn't see shit.
[2883.69s -> 2912.09s]  My aim is so bad. It kicked him off. Okay,
[2912.09s -> 2916.28s]  I gotta get out of here. I have to leave right now.
[2916.28s -> 2925.22s]  Horse revival. It's my horse now. Okay, you're fine. You're good.
[2925.22s -> 2949.64s]  What kind of horse is it? Ooh, nice. Not bad.
[2984.60s -> 2987.32s]  Everyone told me the horse sucked. I looked over. I revived it and was like,
[2987.32s -> 2994.10s]  horse sucks, bad horse, shitty speed. I just, I was trying to get off of
[2994.10s -> 3005.77s]  him. Sort of dealt by decision making. I
[3005.77s -> 3009.05s]  didn't, hey, he ran. I didn't. I just, I just got off of him.
[3009.05s -> 3021.94s]  All right. I just got off. That made me sad.
[3021.94s -> 3032.39s]  I'm sorry. No, you're not. I'm not gonna jump off.
[3032.39s -> 3038.31s]  Just, I got a telephone pole. Can I get down there from here? No, I
[3038.31s -> 3043.13s]  probably can't. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[3043.13s -> 3048.42s]  Hold on a second here. I think we may have found a little campsite.
[3048.42s -> 3059.10s]  Let's hitch the horse. Put some backpacks and everything. There's
[3059.10s -> 3062.95s]  probably something over here. This is why this game's so cool,
[3062.95s -> 3065.27s]  because this is just random shit everywhere.
[3065.27s -> 3071.53s]  It's gotta be something, right? All this stuff over here and there's not anything
[3071.53s -> 3079.85s]  here for me to take. This is really cool. Nothing? Yeah,
[3079.85s -> 3082.73s]  there's a box right here. So I didn't show up when I walked into it
[3082.73s -> 3091.50s]  before. Apparently, I can't do anything with
[3091.50s -> 3117.75s]  this. No, I don't. I opened it up. All right. What's in it?
[3117.75s -> 3122.26s]  Stand on the other side. That doesn't matter. There's nothing in here.
[3122.26s -> 3142.73s]  There's clearly a fucking apple in here though, guys. I mean, for real.
[3142.73s -> 3155.08s]  No, crouch. I'm doing it. I broke somebody's lunchbox. Well, you
[3155.08s -> 3160.70s]  shouldn't have left it there if you cared about it.
[3160.70s -> 3168.39s]  There's something over here. In the well. Let's go.
[3168.39s -> 3171.35s]  Too blurry. Wait, I could actually go down this way, can I?
[3171.35s -> 3177.98s]  Yeah, I can go down here. Why is this GPS telling me to go
[3177.98s -> 3190.10s]  this way? I definitely cannot make it down here.
[3190.10s -> 3196.07s]  Thanks a lot, fucking Google Maps. We're both over here.
[3196.15s -> 3204.36s]  I think I can get down here. We made it. We're good.
[3204.36s -> 3209.56s]  It's all right. You're fine. You're fine. You're good. You're good.
[3209.56s -> 3213.80s]  It's fine. Come on. How deep is this?
[3213.80s -> 3229.38s]  I gotta test the depth. It's pretty deep.
[3229.38s -> 3232.58s]  That's really deep. I don't know if it's gonna make it.
[3232.58s -> 3253.45s]  See, look at how deep this is. You become blunted if you're seen in this area.
[3253.45s -> 3260.17s]  I'm not going back there, am I? I mean, how...
[3260.17s -> 3263.45s]  This whole area is on lockdown. I can't even go over here.
[3268.60s -> 3272.92s]  Be careful. I gotta sneak around. The entire side of the map over here is
[3272.92s -> 3277.88s]  on lockdown. Holy shit. I just don't be seen by anybody
[3277.88s -> 3283.16s]  in the law. Dead Eye Core is empty.
[3283.16s -> 3292.79s]  Oh, let's see. I can eat something, right? Let's drink some brandy.
[3292.79s -> 3305.03s]  And let's also drink another one. Why not? Just gin. Yeah, drink some gin too.
[3305.03s -> 3310.46s]  All right, we're good. So I just need to sneak over here.
[3310.46s -> 3316.07s]  The person I need to talk to is right here.
[3322.14s -> 3326.30s]  Oh, we're supposed to be over here. Look, I'm here, guys.
[3326.30s -> 3332.44s]  I made it. Sorry it took me so long. I was busy.
[3332.44s -> 3339.16s]  I ghost-rid a horse off a cliff. I killed a whole town worth of people.
[3345.24s -> 3354.07s]  And that's where it's going to remain for now. I think he's bait.
[3354.07s -> 3357.59s]  Well, I want to trial him publicly. Gentlemen,
[3357.59s -> 3361.67s]  Sean is being moved up the up. You're going to hear too. I started this
[3361.67s -> 3365.91s]  mission as well. I was drinking at a bar and
[3365.91s -> 3370.47s]  punching people. Sorry. We need to rescue him now.
[3370.47s -> 3377.35s]  Moose? Of course not. Ike's Skeletons, boys.
[3377.35s -> 3381.80s]  I'm moving him to a camp nearby before handing him over to them.
[3381.80s -> 3387.88s]  One person thought that was me. So I guess we need to stop them before they
[3387.88s -> 3392.06s]  get to camp. Charles, why don't you head up on the
[3392.06s -> 3395.66s]  north side and we'll head up on the other side of the valley and meet you.
[3395.66s -> 3398.22s]  That way we have them in either direction.
[3398.22s -> 3401.98s]  Javier, Josiah, come on. Let's go see.
[3401.98s -> 3411.46s]  Come on. You know, Ike. I was gonna throw dynamite down there, but that's too easy.
[3411.46s -> 3418.65s]  Angry. Sure. Rescue Sean and then we'll get ourselves lost good and proper.
[3418.73s -> 3429.88s]  It's a big country. I hope so. Okay, get on your horse. So we got
[3429.88s -> 3436.79s]  Sonic, Tails, and Shadow.
[3436.79s -> 3444.74s]  Find the boat. Let's do it. Let's see if we can track down this boat.
[3444.74s -> 3450.02s]  Keep your eyes open. Knuckles is red. They got patrols out all over this area.
[3450.02s -> 3455.86s]  Yes, south of the river West Elizabeth isn't a very welcoming place right now.
[3455.94s -> 3459.62s]  It's definitely as bad as we feared over here.
[3459.62s -> 3463.54s]  I keep hearing about this woman, Heidi McCourt.
[3463.54s -> 3468.89s]  Hold up here. Hold up. Reckon those might be our boys.
[3468.89s -> 3472.95s]  All right gentlemen. Gotta intercept the boat.
[3472.95s -> 3481.08s]  Nice and easy. Let's make sure it's him first before you go starting
[3481.08s -> 3485.34s]  another war. They're already looking at us.
[3485.34s -> 3489.98s]  Do you think they can see us? If they can, we're just three fellas out on
[3489.98s -> 3493.58s]  the trail. Act natural. We'll be fine.
[3493.58s -> 3499.35s]  So, you've been gone for a while. Much as I love charging the law and
[3499.35s -> 3504.07s]  sleeping in the dirt with you derelicts, I do have a lot of business to attend to.
[3504.07s -> 3512.76s]  This is never a straight road anywhere. Especially with you.
[3512.76s -> 3515.72s]  Nice guy. He's coming out of an old record player.
[3515.88s -> 3518.12s]  People to rob.
[3524.23s -> 3527.19s]  He hasn't stopped talking since we left you in Valentine.
[3527.19s -> 3530.95s]  Fog is riding my life. Cute, dear boy.
[3530.95s -> 3538.09s]  Hey, cute. Have you ever heard of radio?
[3538.09s -> 3543.75s]  No, I don't think so. Pick up the pace a bit.
[3543.75s -> 3546.15s]  Well, you're leading. All right, you want me to lead? Fine. Get out of the
[3546.15s -> 3547.99s]  way then. Apparently there's a camp somewhere
[3547.99s -> 3554.46s]  around. bounty hunters and transfer before continuing out West.
[3554.46s -> 3557.82s]  He's turning back yelling at me to go faster.
[3557.82s -> 3574.26s]  You're the guy in the lead. I'm just kind of following the boat.
[3574.26s -> 3578.23s]  Cinematic mode. Let's just keep it in sight, right?
[3578.23s -> 3588.57s]  I don't really have any control here. Well, do I?
[3588.57s -> 3593.13s]  They've stopped. All right, let's take a closer look.
[3593.13s -> 3602.34s]  All right, the boat's stopped. This gentleman. So who are these bounty hunters?
[3602.34s -> 3606.66s]  There he is. I don't know too much about arch-skeletons, boys.
[3606.66s -> 3612.30s]  They're a big crew, wild, built some reputation in the last year or two.
[3612.30s -> 3616.70s]  That looks like Sean to me. Certainly kicking up enough of a fuss.
[3616.70s -> 3621.10s]  So they execute him out here? Yep, that's definitely Sean.
[3621.10s -> 3626.22s]  Oh, they're giving him a decent kicking. Well, you can only imagine the
[3626.22s -> 3630.89s]  shit he's been giving them. Oh yes, they're taking him up the
[3630.89s -> 3636.15s]  canyon. Is it gallows up here or something?
[3636.15s -> 3642.23s]  Why am I... I thought that was somebody else that we didn't know.
[3642.23s -> 3645.83s]  That wasn't connected to us doing the same thing.
[3645.83s -> 3670.07s]  Just waving at us. We're just tourists on either side of the attraction.
[3670.07s -> 3674.42s]  This is gonna be stealth mission, right? Turn up the volume?
[3674.42s -> 3681.59s]  How's that? Better? We should do this quietly if we can.
[3681.67s -> 3685.77s]  Leave it to me, gentlemen. I'll go around and create a distraction.
[3685.77s -> 3689.45s]  Then you two sneak across and do the dirty on them.
[3689.45s -> 3692.65s]  Okay? Distraction. Crouch down out of...
[3692.65s -> 3696.63s]  All right, so give me my knife. Take out your knife.
[3696.63s -> 3725.70s]  Wait. Okay, I have the knife out. It's TMS.
[3725.70s -> 3736.12s]  You take the one and keep down. Slow down, slow up a little bit, man.
[3736.12s -> 3739.88s]  Slow up a little bit. You're gonna do it before I get there. Dude, come on.
[3739.88s -> 3757.83s]  Let's get up there.
[3762.49s -> 3766.71s]  Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Cattleman revolver. I have one of those.
[3766.71s -> 3779.85s]  Never mind. I don't want that. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[3779.85s -> 3787.40s]  I don't have a horse. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where'd they go?
[3787.40s -> 3794.87s]  Oh, wait. I'm in the water. I gotta go up this way. Hurry, hurry.
[3794.87s -> 3801.14s]  I was too busy fucking looking at this loot.
[3801.14s -> 3804.12s]  Halfway up the canyon to deal with.
[3804.12s -> 3831.14s]  To clean this gun. Looks good, right? Come on. Take out the bounty hunters.
[3831.14s -> 3833.86s]  Stealthy. No sound.
[3833.86s -> 3845.11s]  To get back home again. Me neither. I get. Just travel.
[3845.11s -> 3847.93s]  What?
[3847.93s -> 3848.73s]  There! Look out!
[3848.73s -> 3915.98s]  They turned around like that. I have a plan, R.
[3915.98s -> 3924.62s]  Oh, man. He's dead. Oh, no. This guy.
[3924.62s -> 3927.86s]  I see Charles up there.
[3927.86s -> 3954.41s]  Which one's Charles? I don't know which one's the bad guy. He's using the Lux.
[3959.85s -> 3960.81s]  I just aimed at him and he died.
[3961.61s -> 3967.98s]  Oh, good. Wouldn't go that far.
[3967.98s -> 3969.98s]  The camp's up this way. Come on.
[3971.58s -> 3972.78s]  Truck guns. I have a bow.
[3973.58s -> 3976.30s]  I'll take the left side, Charles. You go right, okay?
[3976.30s -> 3976.78s]  I guess.
[3978.49s -> 3979.05s]  Follow him, boy.
[3979.05s -> 3980.97s]  Let's take these easy we putas.
[3980.97s -> 3982.17s]  God damn army.
[3985.78s -> 4010.74s]  Oh, right in the throat. Oh, I only have one shot left.
[4011.38s -> 4012.42s]  This is fun to use, though.
[4013.22s -> 4024.38s]  What the hell was that? Oh, I'm gonna die.
[4025.34s -> 4034.79s]  All right. Is that happening or am I crazy?
[4035.75s -> 4038.55s]  During the middle of a fight, does this happen automatically once I actually drink it?
[4040.79s -> 4060.97s]  Let's get Sean.
[4061.85s -> 4063.21s]  I got my arrow back.
[4065.64s -> 4067.56s]  Rescue Sean. What do you got down here?
[4068.76s -> 4071.88s]  Is this the button for healing items?
[4071.88s -> 4072.68s]  What are you doing?
[4072.68s -> 4075.11s]  I'm trying to. There's so much stuff.
[4075.83s -> 4078.31s]  Are you gonna get me down from here?
[4078.31s -> 4079.11s]  Oh, right. Okay.
[4084.09s -> 4084.65s]  Shoot, bro.
[4085.77s -> 4087.53s]  No, I ain't doing that all over again.
[4091.59s -> 4095.74s]  You know, you're a lot less ugly from that other angle, Arthur.
[4095.74s -> 4096.38s]  Come on.
[4097.99s -> 4103.83s]  Do we get a hug, Arthur? A warm embrace for a lost brother now found.
[4104.63s -> 4105.27s]  New character.
[4105.91s -> 4109.83s]  You know, nothing means more to me than this gang, the bond we share.
[4109.83s -> 4111.59s]  It's the most real thing to me.
[4111.59s -> 4114.15s]  I would kill for it, I would happily die for it.
[4114.15s -> 4115.67s]  But in spite of all of that,
[4115.67s -> 4118.79s]  I would have easily left you here to rot if Charles hadn't stopped me.
[4118.79s -> 4120.31s]  I don't believe a word of that, Arthur.
[4120.31s -> 4122.31s]  Get him out of here.
[4122.31s -> 4124.07s]  You're a great man, Arthur Morgan.
[4124.07s -> 4126.71s]  The kind of young whipper snapper I can really admire.
[4126.71s -> 4128.31s]  Oh, shut up.
[4128.31s -> 4129.91s]  Right. We should split up.
[4129.91s -> 4131.83s]  Javier, will you escort Mr. McGuire back to camp?
[4131.83s -> 4133.11s]  That was a trailer moment.
[4133.11s -> 4135.03s]  Charles, best you ride separately.
[4135.03s -> 4137.59s]  Be careful. There's patrols everywhere.
[4138.71s -> 4139.83s]  What about you?
[4139.83s -> 4141.43s]  I'm gonna see what's worth taking here.
[4141.43s -> 4143.59s]  I'll meet you back there as soon as I can.
[4143.59s -> 4144.09s]  All right.
[4145.18s -> 4146.06s]  Okay, come on.
[4146.86s -> 4148.30s]  Have I got stories for you?
[4148.30s -> 4149.66s]  Yeah. I can't wait.
[4150.30s -> 4152.30s]  Well, imagine y'all missed me a lot.
[4152.30s -> 4153.34s]  But fear not.
[4153.34s -> 4155.26s]  The joy's back in your lives now.
[4160.55s -> 4161.05s]  Bronze.
[4168.60s -> 4169.48s]  I'm getting hungry.
[4172.10s -> 4174.90s]  Actually, in human world hungry.
[4174.90s -> 4175.94s]  Not in video game world.
[4181.74s -> 4184.30s]  Again, let me, I want to make sure I reiterate this again.
[4185.34s -> 4187.98s]  Tonight, this is the, the suggestions of the,
[4187.98s -> 4192.86s]  the green screen suggestion channel is going to be locked tonight.
[4193.66s -> 4197.94s]  So if you have some, something great that you'd like me to see,
[4199.30s -> 4203.06s]  you got to get it there before like four hours from now.
[4203.70s -> 4208.10s]  How long?
[4208.10s -> 4208.82s]  Chest up here, maybe?
[4209.86s -> 4210.50s]  What?
[4210.50s -> 4211.54s]  Crime reported.
[4216.30s -> 4217.82s]  What? Did somebody call the police?
[4217.82s -> 4218.78s]  I don't understand.
[4218.78s -> 4221.88s]  Where? Who reported the crime?
[4227.02s -> 4230.73s]  Nothing up here.
[4230.73s -> 4231.77s]  Somebody's investigating.
[4231.77s -> 4232.73s]  I gotta go now.
[4233.53s -> 4234.03s]  Get off.
[4234.49s -> 4241.91s]  I ain't going that way.
[4242.63s -> 4245.40s]  Is there a date for the green screen?
[4245.40s -> 4246.52s]  There is not a date yet.
[4248.26s -> 4251.27s]  Are they gonna hit a bird in mid-air?
[4251.27s -> 4251.91s]  That was weird.
[4254.84s -> 4257.00s]  The date is probably going to be this coming next weekend.
[4263.54s -> 4264.98s]  All right, let's see.
[4264.98s -> 4266.26s]  What do I want to do now?
[4267.06s -> 4270.04s]  What's this?
[4271.88s -> 4272.38s]  Trapper.
[4273.00s -> 4274.19s]  Okay.
[4275.64s -> 4277.24s]  This whole side of the map is in lockdown.
[4277.24s -> 4278.20s]  I have to go back over here.
[4278.92s -> 4281.13s]  I don't really have anything I can do.
[4281.13s -> 4282.09s]  I gotta like go to bed.
[4282.09s -> 4283.45s]  I'm gonna go back to my town here.
[4284.25s -> 4285.94s]  I'm gonna go to sleep.
[4291.82s -> 4293.90s]  But yeah, I'm gonna hope for this coming weekend.
[4295.26s -> 4297.42s]  That should be, it should give me enough time to
[4297.50s -> 4301.02s]  to buy all the props, have the props all get shipped
[4302.60s -> 4303.96s]  to the necessary.
[4303.96s -> 4305.96s]  I think I need to, hold on.
[4305.96s -> 4312.94s]  I think I have an achievement or something I can do
[4312.94s -> 4314.46s]  to shoot rabbits on horseback.
[4316.89s -> 4318.41s]  I kind of lost my opportunity there, didn't I?
[4320.33s -> 4321.05s]  Easy now.
[4322.74s -> 4323.46s]  Maybe not.
[4323.46s -> 4330.10s]  I'm very smelly.
[4330.10s -> 4330.60s]  Yeah, I know.
[4331.38s -> 4341.51s]  Okay, doesn't, I don't think this is rabbits.
[4343.11s -> 4343.99s]  What the hell were those?
[4349.62s -> 4350.26s]  What is that?
[4352.82s -> 4353.62s]  I'm dying.
[4355.27s -> 4355.77s]  No.
[4370.84s -> 4371.40s]  Yuck.
[4371.40s -> 4376.63s]  He did the voice.
[4378.90s -> 4379.40s]  And yeah.
[4384.50s -> 4385.00s]  Wait, what?
[4385.62s -> 4389.66s]  One of those is a raccoon?
[4393.26s -> 4394.54s]  Oh wait, how is one of those?
[4400.02s -> 4400.52s]  Okay.
[4401.72s -> 4402.22s]  I guess.
[4405.56s -> 4406.06s]  Any more?
[4406.76s -> 4407.56s]  I need rabbits.
[4409.64s -> 4410.28s]  Oh well.
[4410.28s -> 4411.61s]  Let's take a look.
[4411.61s -> 4412.01s]  What do I got?
[4412.97s -> 4415.77s]  Challenges.
[4415.77s -> 4416.49s]  Find a treasure.
[4417.29s -> 4418.65s]  Win blackjack five times.
[4420.57s -> 4421.29s]  Eat.
[4421.29s -> 4422.33s]  Throw different berries.
[4422.33s -> 4422.89s]  Yeah.
[4422.89s -> 4424.81s]  If I could just kill two more rabbits on horseback.
[4425.45s -> 4429.88s]  Good luck finding a rabbit.
[4430.84s -> 4436.42s]  Rabbits in this game are just everywhere.
[4437.30s -> 4438.90s]  But never when you want them to be around.
[4439.80s -> 4441.00s]  What is that down there?
[4448.02s -> 4448.52s]  What is that?
[4449.14s -> 4453.06s]  There's something up here.
[4454.58s -> 4466.62s]  What is that?
[4466.62s -> 4476.04s]  Oh, it's a skunk.
[4476.76s -> 4480.54s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[4480.54s -> 4481.82s]  Can you just spray my skunk?
[4482.62s -> 4488.20s]  This is a, it's poor.
[4489.08s -> 4493.46s]  All right, let's track the skunk.
[4494.02s -> 4498.79s]  Can I get sprayed?
[4499.43s -> 4500.87s]  I kind of want to just get sprayed.
[4501.59s -> 4508.35s]  Come here.
[4508.81s -> 4510.65s]  Come here, spray me.
[4511.29s -> 4515.38s]  Why are you so, you're so slow.
[4517.00s -> 4517.50s]  Come here.
[4518.20s -> 4526.55s]  I don't know.
[4526.55s -> 4527.75s]  I'm not going to kick a skunk.
[4527.75s -> 4528.55s]  They're so cute.
[4532.33s -> 4532.97s]  I'm not, no.
[4533.53s -> 4534.41s]  It's not going to spray me.
[4534.41s -> 4535.13s]  It doesn't spray me.
[4538.01s -> 4539.29s]  I can't do that to a skunk.
[4541.34s -> 4542.94s]  Go live a very healthy life.
[4545.22s -> 4547.06s]  For at least the next like 11 months.
[4547.06s -> 4548.18s]  Because that's how long you live.
[4548.18s -> 4549.38s]  And that's just sad.
[4549.38s -> 4552.25s]  All right, come back here.
[4552.25s -> 4555.67s]  Corner it.
[4556.65s -> 4557.61s]  I don't think I can.
[4557.61s -> 4558.57s]  It's open field.
[4562.15s -> 4563.35s]  I can't, what is it going to do?
[4570.04s -> 4570.92s]  Throw a punch at it.
[4570.92s -> 4572.04s]  Well, what if I just go like this?
[4582.81s -> 4583.31s]  Spray me.
[4584.26s -> 4585.38s]  Spray me in the face.
[4587.37s -> 4587.87s]  Do it.
[4588.41s -> 4593.94s]  I don't think it's going to happen.
[4593.94s -> 4596.79s]  I need to get a skunk fact?
[4597.35s -> 4602.19s]  Oh well.
[4602.65s -> 4603.15s]  I tried.
[4607.54s -> 4608.34s]  All right, back to camp.
[4611.27s -> 4612.23s]  Run a little over the car.
[4615.94s -> 4616.44s]  Turkeys.
[4617.22s -> 4617.72s]  Turkeys.
[4628.55s -> 4629.19s]  Did he just die?
[4630.22s -> 4630.62s]  Where is he?
[4630.62s -> 4631.50s]  Is he hiding in the bush?
[4638.54s -> 4640.30s]  All right, so let's see if the turkey will spray me in the face.
[4644.58s -> 4645.78s]  He just face planted.
[4649.21s -> 4651.05s]  No, I don't, I don't want to hole in that one.
[4651.05s -> 4651.55s]  Let's go.
[4656.22s -> 4657.50s]  Can you lasso a turkey?
[4664.70s -> 4665.82s]  That's not going to work, right?
[4671.37s -> 4672.25s]  Where the hell did he go?
[4696.15s -> 4697.99s]  He's just in circles.
[4697.99s -> 4698.71s]  Where did he go?
[4702.30s -> 4703.58s]  Where the fuck is he?
[4707.35s -> 4708.55s]  I don't see a turkey.
[4713.62s -> 4714.12s]  Whatever.
[4714.74s -> 4715.30s]  I'm going to go.
[4718.55s -> 4719.75s]  That was full-on.
[4719.75s -> 4721.43s]  It's like mouth into tree.
[4727.93s -> 4729.98s]  This got outspotted by a turkey.
[4732.14s -> 4733.26s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[4733.26s -> 4734.06s]  Speaking of animals.
[4734.70s -> 4739.94s]  We got hay.
[4753.24s -> 4753.88s]  Pet the horse.
[4757.16s -> 4758.20s]  Okay, civilization.
[4759.00s -> 4762.46s]  Hey, partner.
[4762.46s -> 4764.22s]  Head still rolling from the road.
[4781.94s -> 4782.98s]  Oh, wait, wait.
[4782.98s -> 4783.94s]  He doesn't have any weapons.
[4785.06s -> 4785.62s]  I'm just kidding.
[4785.62s -> 4786.10s]  It was a joke.
[4786.10s -> 4786.98s]  Here, take your horse back.
[4788.10s -> 4791.42s]  Stop.
[4791.42s -> 4792.06s]  Take the horse back.
[4792.06s -> 4792.62s]  I was kidding.
[4793.78s -> 4794.50s]  Hey, come here.
[4795.80s -> 4796.28s]  Come here.
[4798.09s -> 4799.85s]  It was, I was making a joke.
[4801.78s -> 4802.28s]  Whoa.
[4835.06s -> 4838.01s]  Where's his hat?
[4840.87s -> 4841.67s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4841.67s -> 4842.17s]  Give me that back.
[4856.25s -> 4857.05s]  Psycho laugh.
[4866.58s -> 4867.14s]  Good joke.
[4867.14s -> 4869.22s]  I wasn't, I wasn't really trying to make a joke in his
[4870.97s -> 4871.77s]  jump to his horse.
[4872.57s -> 4874.31s]  And then he got mad.
[4874.31s -> 4875.27s]  Bro, why, why would he?
[4884.39s -> 4885.03s]  Hey, nice hat.
[4885.03s -> 4885.59s]  Where'd you get it?
[4886.31s -> 4886.87s]  I found it.
[4899.99s -> 4900.63s]  Who got Bill?
[4908.31s -> 4909.11s]  I'm coming with you, man.
[4909.91s -> 4910.79s]  Let's take care of this.
[4911.99s -> 4913.19s]  Let me maintain this gun, though.
[4913.83s -> 4914.39s]  How is it?
[4914.39s -> 4915.19s]  You coming?
[4915.19s -> 4916.15s]  No, I don't need to do that.
[4917.35s -> 4917.83s]  Yeah, I'm coming.
[4917.83s -> 4918.39s]  Let's go.
[4918.39s -> 4919.19s]  All right.
[4919.19s -> 4919.99s]  Lead the way.
[4919.99s -> 4921.19s]  Is it going to be a devil cross?
[4921.19s -> 4922.23s]  It better not be.
[4922.23s -> 4923.75s]  So how'd you find him?
[4923.75s -> 4925.19s]  He said he was going hunting.
[4925.99s -> 4926.79s]  Never returned.
[4927.43s -> 4931.24s]  Was able to track him pretty easily.
[4932.65s -> 4935.85s]  Only a matter of time before they decide to pick up camp.
[4935.85s -> 4936.65s]  Ahead for town.
[4936.65s -> 4937.53s]  That's really cool.
[4937.53s -> 4938.57s]  The mission can come to you.
[4939.85s -> 4940.65s]  That's pretty interesting.
[4941.85s -> 4942.57s]  Fair point.
[4943.69s -> 4945.10s]  Is this random?
[4945.10s -> 4946.30s]  It might, it might be.
[4947.02s -> 4948.30s]  I thought he was just going to run to the tree.
[4952.30s -> 4953.10s]  He's a problem.
[4953.74s -> 4954.54s]  We all know it.
[4956.15s -> 4957.51s]  I need some cores here.
[4957.51s -> 4959.21s]  Hold on.
[4959.21s -> 4960.65s]  I need health and deadeye.
[4961.61s -> 4971.11s]  If I have anything, they can do that for me.
[4971.11s -> 4971.35s]  I think it is.
[4978.57s -> 4987.18s]  That's okay.
[4987.18s -> 4987.66s]  That's good enough.
[4987.66s -> 4991.26s]  I really probably should just refill the deadeye, but whatever.
[4992.14s -> 4997.56s]  Okay.
[4997.56s -> 4999.16s]  Okay, we're getting close.
[4999.56s -> 5001.66s]  A rescue Bill.
[5003.11s -> 5004.15s]  There they are.
[5004.15s -> 5005.59s]  On foot from here.
[5005.59s -> 5009.14s]  Any more arrows?
[5010.18s -> 5012.02s]  Um, sawed off shotgun.
[5015.38s -> 5016.90s]  Double barreled pump action.
[5017.94s -> 5019.54s]  I think I'm going to use the repeater here.
[5019.54s -> 5020.98s]  Let's take out your position.
[5021.94s -> 5023.05s]  How does this thing look?
[5024.09s -> 5026.50s]  We could use a cleaning.
[5027.54s -> 5034.17s]  All right, we're good.
[5034.73s -> 5035.85s]  It's in pretty decent condition.
[5036.73s -> 5040.78s]  So we're going to stake this out.
[5040.78s -> 5042.62s]  So Bill is over here capturing.
[5042.62s -> 5043.58s]  Anyone you are, Arthur?
[5044.95s -> 5050.73s]  I don't know where he is.
[5058.60s -> 5059.72s]  Actually, I might be able to get him.
[5059.72s -> 5062.04s]  All with one deadeye here.
[5062.04s -> 5062.36s]  Let's see.
[5062.36s -> 5062.68s]  Hold on.
[5068.54s -> 5069.10s]  Is that Dutch?
[5086.52s -> 5088.36s]  None of you guys are the guy I'm supposed to be expecting.
[5089.83s -> 5090.47s]  Look at that horse.
[5090.47s -> 5091.75s]  Look at that horse.
[5091.75s -> 5092.31s]  Look at that horse.
[5093.19s -> 5094.55s]  Look at that fucking horse.
[5094.55s -> 5095.19s]  Come here, you.
[5095.19s -> 5096.39s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[5096.39s -> 5096.87s]  Come here.
[5096.87s -> 5097.67s]  Look at you.
[5097.67s -> 5098.15s]  You're huge.
[5098.71s -> 5099.43s]  No, get out of the way.
[5102.62s -> 5103.26s]  The horse.
[5103.26s -> 5105.90s]  Hey, I need to...
[5106.62s -> 5107.99s]  Whose horse?
[5108.71s -> 5109.91s]  Oh, it's Bill's horse.
[5111.03s -> 5117.11s]  I was going to say, damn, man.
[5117.11s -> 5117.91s]  Can I have that?
[5124.71s -> 5125.59s]  Take Bill's shit.
[5139.05s -> 5142.81s]  Arthur, when are they going to learn?
[5144.33s -> 5146.17s]  I can't make him have an accident.
[5147.77s -> 5148.25s]  All right.
[5148.25s -> 5149.77s]  Well, I should be getting on.
[5150.49s -> 5151.61s]  All right, Morgan.
[5152.25s -> 5152.89s]  That's it.
[5152.89s -> 5154.01s]  That horse is crazy.
[5155.96s -> 5156.44s]  Well, whatever.
[5156.44s -> 5157.40s]  That was cool.
[5157.40s -> 5158.52s]  A little random encounter.
[5159.24s -> 5161.48s]  I think I've looted everybody except for these guys over here.
[5165.54s -> 5166.42s]  Don't leave just yet.
[5166.98s -> 5168.90s]  What about crates and shit?
[5168.90s -> 5171.14s]  Boxes hanging up here?
[5171.94s -> 5173.54s]  I don't think so.
[5174.18s -> 5182.62s]  I don't see anything.
[5185.45s -> 5186.09s]  There's a hat.
[5186.65s -> 5187.53s]  Ah, ah, ah.
[5187.53s -> 5188.33s]  There it is.
[5189.85s -> 5190.33s]  Right here.
[5193.34s -> 5193.58s]  What?
[5194.46s -> 5202.14s]  There is a lot of stuff.
[5202.14s -> 5204.94s]  No, I can't take any more brandy or biscuits.
[5206.84s -> 5211.48s]  What am I going to do?
[5211.48s -> 5212.12s]  Get out of here.
[5212.68s -> 5213.80s]  I'm finally blocked in.
[5222.06s -> 5223.54s]  Money?
[5223.54s -> 5224.50s]  There is money in here.
[5225.14s -> 5228.41s]  That's a dollar.
[5229.37s -> 5236.46s]  One dollar in your chest of stuff.
[5237.10s -> 5241.98s]  Might as well use it to cook.
[5242.62s -> 5248.34s]  So big game.
[5248.90s -> 5249.70s]  Playing big game.
[5250.66s -> 5252.26s]  That's really good.
[5253.54s -> 5257.14s]  Cook one, eat it, and then store three of them.
[5257.14s -> 5267.67s]  We're full on all the cores.
[5267.67s -> 5268.31s]  Make another one.
[5268.95s -> 5274.68s]  Cook the baked beans?
[5275.64s -> 5276.28s]  Can you do that?
[5277.16s -> 5284.26s]  I'm getting hungry.
[5284.26s -> 5285.38s]  I'm getting really hungry.
[5292.79s -> 5294.07s]  Something more important, though.
[5297.11s -> 5299.93s]  The internet's been fine, right?
[5300.73s -> 5306.06s]  This is pretty promising stuff.
[5309.50s -> 5310.78s]  6,000 up the whole time.
[5311.50s -> 5316.94s]  I have 23 drop frames in four hours and 30 minutes before that.
[5316.94s -> 5319.26s]  How long is the first stream before I accidentally was an idiot?
[5322.18s -> 5323.38s]  An hour and 10 minutes or something?
[5329.22s -> 5331.30s]  When will I do 1080p streams?
[5332.49s -> 5335.85s]  Now that is going to take probably a little bit longer
[5336.49s -> 5340.20s]  because I'm going to need a full streaming PC to do that.
[5340.92s -> 5348.71s]  1080p 60 FPS is, I guess, obviously the grand of all potential streams.
[5349.51s -> 5357.93s]  The only thing with that, though, is did they ever fix the whole thing with...
[5358.89s -> 5365.13s]  I remember hearing about how, oh, yeah, if you have like an 8,000 up 1080p stream,
[5365.13s -> 5368.01s]  a shitload of people can't even watch it because it'll buffer out the whole time.
[5369.13s -> 5370.57s]  Does that still happen?
[5370.57s -> 5371.93s]  Is that a problem that's been fixed?
[5374.78s -> 5375.74s]  That was a problem before.
[5378.04s -> 5381.80s]  Even putting the stream on low, it brings it down to a point where you still can't even see it.
[5383.80s -> 5392.89s]  1080p 30?
[5392.89s -> 5393.37s]  Yeah, you can do that.
[5393.37s -> 5393.93s]  I can do that, too.
[5395.13s -> 5396.31s]  I just don't...
[5396.31s -> 5397.51s]  I'm not sure because I have...
[5398.63s -> 5400.89s]  I'd have to do a little bit of research on 1080p,
[5402.17s -> 5403.29s]  mainly because it's a...
[5404.98s -> 5405.94s]  This computer is...
[5405.94s -> 5407.86s]  I got a six-core processor.
[5408.74s -> 5410.41s]  Here we go.
[5410.41s -> 5411.05s]  Let's go right here.
[5411.77s -> 5416.54s]  I have a six-core processor, so I could probably handle it,
[5416.54s -> 5418.38s]  but I don't know if I could do it on every game.
[5428.65s -> 5429.15s]  Great.
[5435.24s -> 5436.55s]  Another psycho.
[5444.04s -> 5445.40s]  You care about this girl?
[5446.12s -> 5447.72s]  Stand up for yourself.
[5447.72s -> 5448.60s]  She'll come around.
[5449.32s -> 5451.32s]  Yeah, I've been waiting.
[5461.10s -> 5462.06s]  Trust me, kid.
[5462.86s -> 5465.26s]  There ain't so many good men out there.
[5465.90s -> 5467.98s]  Make yourself one of the good ones.
[5468.78s -> 5469.58s]  Thanks, mister.
[5470.14s -> 5471.26s]  I hope you're right.
[5471.26s -> 5472.62s]  I got points.
[5477.78s -> 5478.82s]  You have a great day.
[5478.82s -> 5479.70s]  I hope you're doing all right.
[5481.54s -> 5482.50s]  Bullet to his head.
[5487.32s -> 5487.96s]  Wait, don't move.
[5494.76s -> 5496.62s]  Can he hit me in the head with a rock?
[5497.26s -> 5501.50s]  Are you scared of what?
[5501.50s -> 5502.30s]  I was going to hunt those.
[5504.94s -> 5505.82s]  He's still talking.
[5505.82s -> 5507.18s]  He still has a bullet on the radar.
[5525.94s -> 5528.74s]  Waste away like some fallen leaf.
[5528.74s -> 5530.66s]  I kind of want to listen to this guy's whole dialogue.
[5530.66s -> 5531.54s]  Wouldn't that be nice?
[5541.00s -> 5541.56s]  Come on.
[5543.02s -> 5544.62s]  Can't move around here all day.
[5545.50s -> 5552.18s]  Come on.
[5552.18s -> 5552.74s]  Where does he go?
[5568.57s -> 5569.45s]  He looks so odd.
[5581.94s -> 5582.74s]  I was trying to talk to him.
[5591.69s -> 5593.29s]  Just Superman punch him?
[5595.00s -> 5595.56s]  I can't.
[5596.74s -> 5598.10s]  Guys, we're evil.
[5598.10s -> 5601.30s]  We're only evil when it's a random act of evil.
[5601.86s -> 5603.14s]  You know, if somebody stops in the road
[5603.14s -> 5604.18s]  and they're like, who the fuck are you?
[5604.18s -> 5605.14s]  And I'm like, who the fuck are you?
[5605.22s -> 5605.70s]  You're not.
[5608.54s -> 5610.06s]  I'm not just going to murder this guy.
[5613.18s -> 5613.66s]  Wait, I can't.
[5613.66s -> 5614.62s]  I have to like...
[5614.62s -> 5615.42s]  Okay.
[5615.42s -> 5615.90s]  See you.
[5617.10s -> 5617.58s]  There we go.
[5618.87s -> 5620.23s]  I can't be in cinematic cam, dude.
[5620.23s -> 5621.19s]  Like, say hello to the guy.
[5634.49s -> 5634.97s]  Not much.
[5635.53s -> 5636.01s]  Let me be.
[5638.86s -> 5640.38s]  This guy's not happy with me right now.
[5640.38s -> 5641.02s]  I got to stay back.
[5641.90s -> 5651.75s]  I got to keep a distance where I'm not following him.
[5654.68s -> 5655.56s]  Tay, it's right here.
[5656.28s -> 5658.52s]  This is the distance that I'm legally allowed to be behind him.
[5659.24s -> 5662.12s]  Before he gets upset about it.
[5675.94s -> 5676.90s]  Restraining order?
[5676.90s -> 5677.38s]  No, no.
[5677.38s -> 5679.38s]  I'm just saying like in the video game world.
[5681.26s -> 5681.74s]  Rabbits!
[5681.74s -> 5682.14s]  Rabbits!
[5682.70s -> 5695.03s]  Who's just screaming?
[5695.67s -> 5697.94s]  Did you hear that?
[5705.42s -> 5706.62s]  He just fucking screamed.
[5711.82s -> 5713.82s]  Is this guy going to walk all the way back to my camp?
[5717.02s -> 5717.58s]  Just go?
[5717.58s -> 5717.98s]  I know.
[5717.98s -> 5719.74s]  I need to know where this guy's going.
[5721.93s -> 5722.81s]  Here are your choices.
[5723.62s -> 5723.94s]  Okay.
[5724.50s -> 5725.86s]  Follow this guy and see where he goes.
[5726.50s -> 5728.10s]  Or shotgun to his head.
[5728.66s -> 5729.62s]  That's like...
[5729.62s -> 5730.66s]  Those are the two options.
[5737.51s -> 5738.23s]  See?
[5738.23s -> 5738.63s]  Follow.
[5739.19s -> 5742.62s]  I don't have an off switch.
[5742.62s -> 5743.50s]  I don't have an in-between.
[5745.83s -> 5748.39s]  It's one or one hundred.
[5749.03s -> 5757.03s]  What if he leads me to something?
[5757.03s -> 5761.90s]  But not zero.
[5761.90s -> 5762.54s]  No, never zero.
[5762.54s -> 5763.74s]  Why would you ever give zero percent?
[5764.38s -> 5769.93s]  That's a good thing.
[5770.57s -> 5771.29s]  Who is this?
[5771.29s -> 5772.65s]  Horsebag Sonic.
[5772.65s -> 5773.69s]  Right, that's what your name is.
[5776.49s -> 5777.29s]  Partner?
[5777.29s -> 5777.69s]  Hello?
[5780.49s -> 5782.81s]  Might as well be friendly, I say.
[5784.25s -> 5786.90s]  I've been following him for so long.
[5787.86s -> 5788.58s]  All the best.
[5790.36s -> 5798.25s]  This is a nice walk, though.
[5798.25s -> 5799.29s]  Nice and misty up here.
[5800.09s -> 5802.78s]  Look at this.
[5802.78s -> 5803.42s]  This is great.
[5804.22s -> 5808.63s]  I mean, technically I am going in the right direction, so...
[5815.91s -> 5823.08s]  It's getting kind of bad out right now.
[5823.08s -> 5824.12s]  This is not getting good.
[5824.12s -> 5824.68s]  This is...
[5824.68s -> 5826.20s]  The weather's getting a little treacherous.
[5834.28s -> 5834.68s]  Hey.
[5834.68s -> 5835.40s]  Hey, mister.
[5842.50s -> 5844.10s]  Walking home in the rain.
[5844.10s -> 5844.34s]  Yep.
[5844.98s -> 5852.97s]  I feel like we're playing an old Recess game.
[5853.69s -> 5854.97s]  It's like Red Light Green Light.
[5863.37s -> 5864.33s]  This feels illegal.
[5864.33s -> 5865.13s]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[5865.13s -> 5865.45s]  I'm sorry.
[5865.45s -> 5865.85s]  I'm sorry.
[5867.83s -> 5868.39s]  No.
[5868.39s -> 5868.79s]  No, okay.
[5870.57s -> 5874.90s]  What?
[5874.90s -> 5876.58s]  Oh no, another random person!
[5877.14s -> 5877.38s]  No!
[5879.27s -> 5880.15s]  No, no, no!
[5880.15s -> 5881.27s]  Don't do this to me now!
[5881.27s -> 5881.77s]  Please!
[5885.05s -> 5885.55s]  No!
[5886.65s -> 5888.33s]  If you could help me with these shackles,
[5888.33s -> 5891.29s]  I just might have a chance.
[5891.29s -> 5891.79s]  Oh!
[5892.57s -> 5893.61s]  Okay, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[5893.61s -> 5894.81s]  How did you end up like this?
[5894.81s -> 5895.29s]  Quickly, quickly.
[5895.29s -> 5896.97s]  Just shoot the damn chains already.
[5898.50s -> 5899.70s]  Come on!
[5899.70s -> 5902.38s]  All right.
[5902.38s -> 5903.02s]  Oh.
[5903.02s -> 5903.90s]  Oh, yes.
[5903.90s -> 5904.62s]  He's running!
[5904.62s -> 5905.12s]  Yes.
[5905.74s -> 5906.30s]  Perfect.
[5919.16s -> 5920.12s]  He's still talking.
[5920.12s -> 5927.27s]  Don't let him get away.
[5927.27s -> 5927.99s]  Robbery tip?
[5933.91s -> 5934.23s]  Horse?
[5935.50s -> 5936.14s]  What is that?
[5940.06s -> 5940.94s]  Is that the same guy?
[5941.58s -> 5943.10s]  I don't even think that's the same guy.
[5943.74s -> 5945.10s]  I think this is a different person.
[5945.74s -> 5957.74s]  I'm gonna run out of juice here.
[5958.38s -> 5964.90s]  Where do you go?
[5964.90s -> 5965.70s]  Where, where, where, where, where?
[5966.26s -> 5967.64s]  What is this?
[5968.78s -> 5969.26s]  What happened?
[5969.90s -> 5971.03s]  Somebody find him.
[5971.03s -> 5971.67s]  Somebody point him out.
[5971.67s -> 5972.15s]  Point him out!
[5985.34s -> 5985.74s]  Where is he?
[5985.74s -> 5986.54s]  Where'd he go?
[5986.54s -> 5990.52s]  Give me the fucking horse.
[5990.52s -> 5991.16s]  Get on the horse.
[5991.16s -> 5991.96s]  Where the fuck were you?
[5992.92s -> 5994.87s]  Where the fuck were you, buddy?
[5995.51s -> 5997.61s]  Took you long enough.
[5998.81s -> 5999.29s]  Where is he?
[6021.37s -> 6021.85s]  Found him.
[6021.85s -> 6022.09s]  No.
[6022.09s -> 6027.42s]  That's not him.
[6027.42s -> 6028.06s]  God damn it.
[6028.86s -> 6045.51s]  Oh well.
[6045.51s -> 6048.04s]  Congrats on a waste of time.
[6048.04s -> 6048.36s]  I know.
[6050.49s -> 6051.13s]  Honest to God.
[6051.77s -> 6057.40s]  Who are you?
[6057.40s -> 6061.75s]  Hey.
[6061.75s -> 6063.19s]  Hey, Wallace.
[6063.19s -> 6065.59s]  This here's the kind soul I was telling you about.
[6065.59s -> 6068.31s]  The one that got the venom out of your leg.
[6068.31s -> 6070.47s]  Oh, it's the, it's the venom guy.
[6070.47s -> 6076.49s]  I know I can never repay you, but you head over to gunsmith
[6077.50s -> 6081.85s]  and pick out your choice of item on my tab.
[6083.94s -> 6084.50s]  Thanks.
[6084.50s -> 6086.42s]  Yeah, it seemed like the least I could do
[6087.06s -> 6090.66s]  with him being sent straight from the almighty to save my life.
[6090.66s -> 6093.06s]  Yeah, the almighty.
[6093.06s -> 6094.42s]  Always a doubter you are.
[6095.06s -> 6096.42s]  I'm a man of this world.
[6096.42s -> 6098.10s]  You guys told me to shoot him in the head.
[6098.10s -> 6098.50s]  Anyway.
[6099.62s -> 6100.42s]  Free item.
[6100.42s -> 6100.98s]  Anything?
[6100.98s -> 6102.10s]  I could take any gun for free.
[6104.33s -> 6105.69s]  What can I do for you?
[6105.69s -> 6109.69s]  Fitter outside told me I could grab something on his tab.
[6109.69s -> 6111.61s]  One with the bite in his leg.
[6111.61s -> 6115.18s]  Oh, he's good for it.
[6115.18s -> 6117.74s]  But all he's good for between the two of us.
[6117.74s -> 6119.10s]  Well, take a look around.
[6119.10s -> 6120.06s]  Find something you like.
[6120.06s -> 6121.34s]  Now put it on his tab.
[6121.34s -> 6121.74s]  What?
[6121.74s -> 6122.94s]  Any gun in the whole game?
[6122.94s -> 6123.82s]  In the whole catalog?
[6124.86s -> 6127.77s]  Hold on a second here.
[6127.77s -> 6128.25s]  Rifles.
[6132.65s -> 6133.61s]  72 bucks.
[6133.61s -> 6134.89s]  145 bucks.
[6137.35s -> 6138.31s]  180 bucks.
[6138.31s -> 6139.19s]  120 bucks.
[6139.91s -> 6144.36s]  These are locked though, unfortunately.
[6145.61s -> 6149.16s]  85, 95, 148.
[6152.18s -> 6153.62s]  One free gun.
[6154.50s -> 6155.14s]  Oh, dude.
[6157.05s -> 6158.25s]  I got a pistol cartridge.
[6158.25s -> 6159.21s]  It was $1.50.
[6161.45s -> 6162.09s]  Now it's zero.
[6165.06s -> 6167.48s]  All right.
[6169.72s -> 6170.76s]  I gotta calm down here.
[6171.32s -> 6173.72s]  Just give me the most expensive gun in the whole catalog that I can buy.
[6175.00s -> 6179.53s]  Do I get to save this or do I have to do it right now?
[6187.58s -> 6189.10s]  This pump action, I already own it.
[6190.33s -> 6191.29s]  I already own this one.
[6195.72s -> 6197.16s]  I can't even buy these because they're locked.
[6198.41s -> 6201.13s]  Well, this Springfield rifle is 120 bucks.
[6201.13s -> 6201.77s]  I don't have this.
[6202.49s -> 6207.56s]  Varmint rifle 72.
[6207.56s -> 6209.88s]  I need one of these to get clean kills on it and some animals.
[6215.70s -> 6218.58s]  Master Mauser pistol 250.
[6218.58s -> 6219.14s]  210.
[6221.51s -> 6224.23s]  150 bucks for the Volcanic pistol.
[6227.11s -> 6230.84s]  Schofield 84.
[6230.84s -> 6231.32s]  Volcanic.
[6231.32s -> 6232.68s]  Why is Volcanic so much more expensive?
[6233.40s -> 6238.42s]  I think I'm going for Volcanic.
[6238.42s -> 6238.66s]  Yeah.
[6239.62s -> 6248.04s]  The most explosive pistol ever.
[6249.90s -> 6250.54s]  Schofield?
[6254.87s -> 6255.43s]  Volcanic.
[6255.43s -> 6255.83s]  Shit.
[6255.83s -> 6256.87s]  Springfield.
[6256.87s -> 6257.59s]  Not Volcanic.
[6262.71s -> 6265.59s]  I mean, it's either Schofield.
[6266.84s -> 6269.24s]  Or the Springfield rifle.
[6271.30s -> 6272.82s]  120 versus 84.
[6272.82s -> 6273.54s]  I'm probably going to get it.
[6273.54s -> 6274.50s]  I need a good rifle.
[6275.06s -> 6279.27s]  Modern Firefire, these Firefields.
[6279.27s -> 6280.31s]  Is it single shot or what?
[6280.95s -> 6289.32s]  Yeah, the rifle that I have is kind of junk.
[6290.12s -> 6291.16s]  Yeah, I'm going to get it.
[6291.16s -> 6291.80s]  Single shot.
[6291.80s -> 6292.52s]  Okay, that's fine.
[6293.94s -> 6294.90s]  You can't aim.
[6294.90s -> 6295.38s]  I'll learn.
[6296.26s -> 6302.17s]  You get Volcanic for free anyways.
[6302.17s -> 6303.85s]  Well, this one's 120 bucks.
[6303.85s -> 6305.13s]  The other one's 80.
[6305.13s -> 6306.17s]  But more bang for buck.
[6306.89s -> 6308.38s]  I'm getting it.
[6308.38s -> 6309.50s]  Fine choice.
[6309.50s -> 6310.78s]  I'll let them know.
[6310.94s -> 6312.22s]  And then we're going to deck it out.
[6314.57s -> 6315.13s]  Components.
[6315.85s -> 6316.89s]  Hey, the thing was for free.
[6316.89s -> 6317.85s]  Might as well deck it out.
[6319.34s -> 6319.74s]  Rifling.
[6319.74s -> 6321.82s]  Customize groove to improve stability.
[6322.62s -> 6323.74s]  More range on it.
[6324.78s -> 6325.02s]  Yeah.
[6326.06s -> 6328.86s]  Okay.
[6331.19s -> 6331.91s]  Iron sights.
[6332.71s -> 6333.51s]  Improved sights.
[6334.31s -> 6335.74s]  This shit's $5.
[6335.74s -> 6336.46s]  I got it for free.
[6337.66s -> 6342.15s]  You can put a scope on it.
[6342.15s -> 6342.95s]  Medium scope.
[6343.59s -> 6345.67s]  Well, that kind of defeats the iron sights then, doesn't it?
[6346.68s -> 6348.20s]  Let's put a fucking scope on it.
[6350.74s -> 6351.46s]  Screw it, man.
[6351.46s -> 6352.02s]  Let's do it.
[6352.66s -> 6357.40s]  Straight grain.
[6358.12s -> 6359.24s]  Wide grain.
[6360.84s -> 6361.64s]  Basic grain.
[6362.60s -> 6363.64s]  I like the straight grain.
[6364.20s -> 6369.40s]  And let's get a wrap here.
[6369.96s -> 6371.61s]  I do not know.
[6372.97s -> 6373.93s]  It helps from wear and tear.
[6376.01s -> 6377.43s]  I got a trophy.
[6378.07s -> 6379.66s]  Okay.
[6380.30s -> 6383.61s]  All right.
[6383.61s -> 6384.17s]  Styles.
[6385.35s -> 6385.75s]  Metals.
[6386.47s -> 6388.68s]  This is the barrel.
[6392.94s -> 6393.26s]  Gold?
[6395.26s -> 6395.58s]  Blue?
[6400.70s -> 6404.02s]  Frame.
[6404.66s -> 6405.38s]  To the whole thing.
[6405.38s -> 6406.66s]  Oh, that looks nice.
[6407.86s -> 6409.62s]  I kind of like the muted gold here.
[6409.62s -> 6410.10s]  I don't...
[6410.10s -> 6410.26s]  Yeah.
[6410.26s -> 6411.22s]  We're going with...
[6411.22s -> 6412.10s]  We're going with brass.
[6413.78s -> 6417.18s]  What's about the hammer here?
[6422.04s -> 6422.44s]  Brass.
[6427.00s -> 6427.88s]  The sight can be...
[6432.15s -> 6432.63s]  Brass.
[6433.51s -> 6434.87s]  It's just a brass.
[6435.67s -> 6436.23s]  Okay.
[6436.23s -> 6439.43s]  At what point am I just making like a fucking tuba?
[6439.43s -> 6440.15s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6440.15s -> 6442.55s]  Like, I'm turning this into a French horn.
[6444.15s -> 6447.91s]  If I blow in the end of this, it's going to make fucking musical sounds.
[6447.91s -> 6452.98s]  All right.
[6452.98s -> 6454.58s]  We're going to go just straight up steel here.
[6457.69s -> 6461.18s]  Ooh, baby.
[6462.18s -> 6462.98s]  Full engraving.
[6463.54s -> 6466.04s]  Can't really even see that.
[6471.38s -> 6472.98s]  That's 28 bucks.
[6473.54s -> 6475.51s]  Engrave the barrel?
[6476.68s -> 6477.08s]  No.
[6477.08s -> 6478.68s]  Engrave the frame, though.
[6478.68s -> 6479.08s]  No.
[6479.08s -> 6479.72s]  Trap door.
[6480.52s -> 6481.64s]  You can't even see this shit.
[6484.31s -> 6485.03s]  Carvings.
[6485.03s -> 6485.35s]  Grip.
[6487.11s -> 6488.23s]  Oh, man.
[6488.23s -> 6489.83s]  This thing is going to be nice.
[6489.83s -> 6490.63s]  I like the eagle.
[6493.14s -> 6493.38s]  Hmm.
[6494.42s -> 6495.86s]  Now, the question is which eagle?
[6495.86s -> 6499.94s]  Are we talking just straight up like back of the coin eagle?
[6499.94s -> 6501.38s]  Are we talking mid-flight eagle?
[6502.02s -> 6507.58s]  I think I like the commemorative gold coin eagle that's on the infomercial.
[6514.95s -> 6516.87s]  Ah, it's ruined.
[6518.02s -> 6520.02s]  It's being covered up by the thing to protect it.
[6522.73s -> 6523.37s]  Leather.
[6523.37s -> 6528.54s]  I like that.
[6529.34s -> 6530.30s]  I like the chocolate.
[6532.02s -> 6532.98s]  Chocolate looks pretty good.
[6535.19s -> 6535.99s]  Olive, maybe?
[6537.43s -> 6541.18s]  Tobacco.
[6541.74s -> 6551.66s]  Let's get a good varnish on it.
[6552.22s -> 6555.30s]  Oh, this is the piece that sells it.
[6555.30s -> 6555.78s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6556.58s -> 6560.84s]  That looks kind of good.
[6561.78s -> 6562.74s]  Dark walnut.
[6565.26s -> 6565.90s]  There it is.
[6567.46s -> 6570.10s]  That's the fucking desk I have right now.
[6572.84s -> 6573.96s]  Dark walnut.
[6573.96s -> 6576.89s]  Can I see a better image of this?
[6577.53s -> 6582.63s]  Yeah, I have to do it.
[6582.63s -> 6583.27s]  This is my desk.
[6583.91s -> 6585.56s]  Did that just say desk?
[6585.56s -> 6587.08s]  Oh, desk walnut.
[6588.60s -> 6593.62s]  Dark walnut.
[6593.62s -> 6594.42s]  Look at that.
[6594.42s -> 6596.42s]  Look at that desk that shoots bullets.
[6599.80s -> 6601.53s]  Ammunition.
[6601.53s -> 6602.81s]  What kind of ammunition?
[6602.81s -> 6603.29s]  Rifle.
[6603.29s -> 6604.33s]  Express 30.
[6605.13s -> 6607.93s]  Regular express or high velocity.
[6608.49s -> 6610.50s]  This one's more damage.
[6610.50s -> 6611.38s]  This one's more range.
[6620.47s -> 6621.75s]  Range or damage?
[6623.26s -> 6624.86s]  The never-ending conundrum.
[6625.50s -> 6630.14s]  There's already a lot of damage range.
[6631.42s -> 6636.09s]  I guess I can get them both, huh?
[6636.09s -> 6638.46s]  Well, that was a lot of money.
[6639.10s -> 6639.90s]  Three.
[6639.90s -> 6647.51s]  How much did I just spend?
[6647.51s -> 6648.55s]  What?
[6648.55s -> 6649.27s]  I'm a moron?
[6649.27s -> 6649.51s]  Why?
[6650.07s -> 6652.87s]  I just bought high velocity.
[6653.67s -> 6655.42s]  That's $12.
[6655.42s -> 6655.98s]  That's nothing.
[6655.98s -> 6656.46s]  That's fine.
[6658.84s -> 6660.92s]  So I can switch between ammos, right?
[6660.92s -> 6662.12s]  I can just get them both.
[6671.53s -> 6673.93s]  I'm going to use the shitty ammo to learn.
[6680.82s -> 6682.34s]  I have every fucking ammo now.
[6687.67s -> 6688.55s]  Take off the scope.
[6689.35s -> 6690.23s]  Why would I do that?
[6691.51s -> 6694.23s]  Why would I get rid of my tuba horn gun desk?
[6694.23s -> 6694.87s]  Are you serious?
[6695.75s -> 6696.47s]  No.
[6696.47s -> 6705.85s]  This thing's ready to go.
[6706.73s -> 6709.38s]  Let's take a look.
[6709.38s -> 6710.10s]  Let's check it out.
[6714.50s -> 6714.98s]  Look at that.
[6716.14s -> 6716.78s]  Oh, man.
[6716.78s -> 6717.50s]  Does that look good?
[6718.22s -> 6722.81s]  So what is it?
[6722.81s -> 6723.61s]  Let's go to the...
[6723.61s -> 6725.48s]  I can't even open it.
[6725.48s -> 6726.76s]  Nice free gun.
[6726.76s -> 6728.12s]  Yeah, don't you just stand there until they get you.
[6729.38s -> 6732.42s]  The gun is free and then you spend $400 on components.
[6733.30s -> 6737.16s]  This gun is just a mobile game.
[6737.80s -> 6740.47s]  How's it treating you?
[6740.47s -> 6741.10s]  All right.
[6741.10s -> 6743.18s]  I need to get to like a little range here to aim it.
[6745.05s -> 6745.93s]  Go show the guy.
[6746.65s -> 6747.53s]  That's not a bad idea.
[6748.41s -> 6754.46s]  Where is he?
[6754.46s -> 6755.18s]  Is he still here?
[6755.18s -> 6755.82s]  There he is.
[6755.82s -> 6756.22s]  Hey, man.
[6757.26s -> 6757.74s]  What do you think?
[6758.30s -> 6759.90s]  I'll let the clerk know.
[6759.90s -> 6760.62s]  Thanks again.
[6761.26s -> 6761.58s]  Sure.
[6762.30s -> 6767.26s]  This is the best stranger in the game.
[6768.06s -> 6769.64s]  Can I sit next to him?
[6770.28s -> 6777.93s]  Yeah.
[6777.93s -> 6779.85s]  You think you can fuck with the desk trombone?
[6780.57s -> 6781.29s]  Thanks a lot, dude.
[6790.02s -> 6791.86s]  I want to test it out, but I can't open...
[6791.86s -> 6793.70s]  I can't take the gun out right now.
[6793.70s -> 6794.98s]  I have to go somewhere safe.
[6797.96s -> 6801.72s]  Snipe him from a distance.
[6805.72s -> 6806.84s]  Thanks for the new gun.
[6806.84s -> 6807.88s]  Let me try it out.
[6814.98s -> 6815.30s]  No.
[6816.10s -> 6816.82s]  I can't.
[6817.38s -> 6818.10s]  I can't.
[6819.62s -> 6820.82s]  That's too awful.
[6821.86s -> 6822.34s]  Where is it?
[6822.34s -> 6823.70s]  Where's the gun store from here?
[6824.18s -> 6826.18s]  I'm aiming.
[6826.18s -> 6826.66s]  It's right.
[6826.66s -> 6827.62s]  I got to go around.
[6828.42s -> 6831.34s]  Let me line him up.
[6831.34s -> 6832.30s]  God damn it.
[6833.02s -> 6839.21s]  He's right there.
[6839.21s -> 6839.69s]  Okay.
[6839.69s -> 6841.37s]  Let me get this straight.
[6841.37s -> 6844.70s]  I'm going to go up here.
[6846.50s -> 6848.71s]  He's the best...
[6848.71s -> 6850.31s]  I just want to see if I can do it.
[6851.03s -> 6852.71s]  I just want to see how long the scope is.
[6853.59s -> 6866.97s]  How do I change the bullet?
[6866.97s -> 6869.96s]  High velocity.
[6869.96s -> 6871.02s]  Okay.
[6871.02s -> 6871.66s]  Here we go.
[6871.66s -> 6874.92s]  How do I go into scope mode?
[6874.92s -> 6875.32s]  There we go.
[6875.96s -> 6885.93s]  That's not very far.
[6893.26s -> 6893.90s]  I can't.
[6894.70s -> 6896.06s]  I can't do it, guys.
[6896.86s -> 6897.90s]  I can't do it.
[6897.90s -> 6899.10s]  That's not nice.
[6899.10s -> 6900.38s]  You gave me a free gun.
[6900.38s -> 6900.62s]  What?
[6900.62s -> 6901.90s]  Do you think I'm going to shoot him?
[6905.21s -> 6906.25s]  I can't do this.
[6906.97s -> 6911.50s]  What if he gives me another free gun in like an hour?
[6911.50s -> 6914.49s]  And there's no saving.
[6914.49s -> 6915.61s]  I can't just save it.
[6916.25s -> 6924.78s]  Look, this guy didn't give me a gun.
[6924.78s -> 6925.82s]  We can test it on him.
[6939.62s -> 6940.18s]  I missed him.
[6947.51s -> 6949.45s]  Just imagine that guy.
[6956.49s -> 6956.89s]  Okay.
[6956.89s -> 6959.45s]  The guy that gave me the gun, right?
[6959.45s -> 6960.09s]  I go out and I'm like,
[6960.09s -> 6961.29s]  Hey, what do you think?
[6961.29s -> 6962.09s]  Oh, that's great.
[6962.09s -> 6962.33s]  Yeah.
[6962.33s -> 6963.21s]  Put it on my tab.
[6964.26s -> 6965.78s]  Like four minutes later.
[6965.78s -> 6966.58s]  It's just quiet.
[6966.58s -> 6967.38s]  All of a sudden.
[6967.38s -> 6971.22s]  Oh, a long scope shot dings off the back of somebody's carriage.
[6971.22s -> 6972.50s]  You're standing right there.
[6974.87s -> 6976.15s]  No crime committed.
[6976.15s -> 6980.23s]  I'm fine.
[6980.23s -> 6982.39s]  Oh, that's so fucking stupid.
[6983.67s -> 6984.63s]  Nobody's looking for me.
[6984.63s -> 6985.59s]  Oh, sorry, man.
[6985.59s -> 6986.15s]  I shot.
[6986.15s -> 6988.63s]  I shot a gun into a guy's fucking carriage.
[6995.58s -> 6997.10s]  You see me just like,
[6997.10s -> 6997.50s]  Oh, shit.
[6997.50s -> 6998.70s]  I got to get out of here.
[6998.78s -> 6999.98s]  Run off in the distance.
[7004.10s -> 7005.62s]  I fucking missed.
[7005.62s -> 7005.86s]  All right.
[7005.86s -> 7006.66s]  Let's go to church.
[7015.10s -> 7015.74s]  The same guy.
[7015.74s -> 7016.30s]  You turn around.
[7016.30s -> 7017.02s]  He looks to his right.
[7017.02s -> 7018.54s]  He sees a guy going to church now.
[7020.14s -> 7020.86s]  Oh, man.
[7022.54s -> 7024.76s]  God, somebody needs help.
[7024.76s -> 7025.08s]  Hold on.
[7028.65s -> 7029.37s]  Who?
[7029.37s -> 7033.06s]  Who needs help?
[7033.70s -> 7035.82s]  I don't.
[7035.82s -> 7036.06s]  Who?
[7036.06s -> 7036.38s]  I don't.
[7036.38s -> 7037.42s]  Who needs help?
[7037.42s -> 7041.80s]  I don't see anybody.
[7041.80s -> 7045.43s]  Okay.
[7048.22s -> 7051.40s]  Um, I don't see anybody.
[7051.40s -> 7052.20s]  So let's go to church.
[7055.03s -> 7055.27s]  Whoa.
[7057.86s -> 7058.18s]  Okay.
[7059.86s -> 7067.14s]  Where is this guy?
[7071.29s -> 7072.94s]  Oh, it's you.
[7072.94s -> 7073.18s]  Okay.
[7088.42s -> 7088.98s]  Yeah, whatever.
[7088.98s -> 7089.46s]  That's fine.
[7095.30s -> 7096.74s]  Just going to pretend to be a guy's friend.
[7101.37s -> 7101.93s]  Honor money.
[7102.57s -> 7103.77s]  Last friend died.
[7104.89s -> 7105.69s]  It weren't my fault.
[7106.57s -> 7107.45s]  They said it was,
[7108.09s -> 7109.45s]  but they was wrong.
[7111.24s -> 7112.68s]  It's fun being with you, Mister.
[7114.12s -> 7115.56s]  Can I hold you a second, Mister?
[7116.73s -> 7117.13s]  Can I?
[7119.08s -> 7119.88s]  Yeah, sure.
[7119.88s -> 7120.92s]  How goes things with you?
[7123.78s -> 7124.74s]  Okay, just...
[7124.74s -> 7125.54s]  I'm so dirty.
[7128.79s -> 7131.08s]  That felt...
[7131.08s -> 7132.68s]  It's nice to be held sometimes.
[7132.68s -> 7133.48s]  Honor money.
[7133.48s -> 7135.32s]  Oh, we used to hold each other in the war.
[7136.54s -> 7138.06s]  You got sad eyes, Mister.
[7138.06s -> 7139.10s]  You look like a ghoul.
[7139.10s -> 7139.82s]  Like you've seen.
[7140.54s -> 7141.58s]  Sad things.
[7142.78s -> 7145.88s]  Remember with kindness.
[7145.88s -> 7149.67s]  This guy's going to come back at some point.
[7150.71s -> 7159.37s]  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7159.37s -> 7160.73s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[7160.73s -> 7161.45s]  Hey, whoa!
[7161.45s -> 7162.65s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[7163.53s -> 7166.01s]  Hey, excuse me.
[7166.65s -> 7167.29s]  Where's my gun?
[7167.29s -> 7167.77s]  Where's my gun?
[7167.77s -> 7168.33s]  Where's my gun?
[7169.05s -> 7170.39s]  Where's my gun?
[7172.09s -> 7172.81s]  Where's my gun?
[7178.63s -> 7179.67s]  Give me my gun back.
[7179.67s -> 7181.75s]  I spent so much time getting it.
[7181.75s -> 7182.47s]  Give me the gun.
[7183.35s -> 7184.86s]  Give me my gun, please.
[7185.50s -> 7187.18s]  I spent so much time getting that gun.
[7189.58s -> 7190.46s]  Give me my gun back.
[7191.18s -> 7192.71s]  Give me my gun.
[7193.43s -> 7195.13s]  Where's my gun?
[7199.16s -> 7203.54s]  Where's my gun?
[7205.18s -> 7205.82s]  Wait, what?
[7206.78s -> 7207.10s]  What?
[7207.90s -> 7208.38s]  What?
[7208.94s -> 7209.66s]  What?
[7209.66s -> 7209.98s]  What?
[7211.50s -> 7211.82s]  What?
[7212.46s -> 7214.06s]  No, what?
[7214.06s -> 7215.98s]  It's all the same.
[7215.98s -> 7217.90s]  Oh, oh boy.
[7217.90s -> 7219.82s]  Oh, oh boy.
[7224.63s -> 7225.91s]  Get me out of here.
[7225.91s -> 7227.27s]  Get me out of here.
[7227.27s -> 7228.57s]  Don't even want me.
[7229.45s -> 7232.84s]  This is in pain.
[7233.80s -> 7235.40s]  I thought everyone told me he robbed me.
[7235.40s -> 7236.28s]  I thought he robbed me.
[7236.28s -> 7237.40s]  I didn't have the gun on me.
[7237.40s -> 7238.60s]  I thought I had the gun on me.
[7239.40s -> 7245.61s]  I thought he stole my rifle.
[7245.61s -> 7246.65s]  I thought he stole it.
[7248.89s -> 7249.77s]  Easy, girl.
[7249.77s -> 7250.33s]  Easy.
[7251.13s -> 7257.66s]  Okay, I got it.
[7257.66s -> 7259.98s]  I got it.
[7283.26s -> 7289.00s]  I gotta get out of here, dude.
[7292.26s -> 7293.70s]  I have to leave now.
[7293.70s -> 7294.42s]  I gotta get out of here.
[7294.42s -> 7295.06s]  I'm gonna die.
[7300.33s -> 7302.73s]  I can't.
[7306.60s -> 7307.08s]  Get up.
[7307.08s -> 7307.48s]  Get up.
[7308.04s -> 7308.52s]  Get up.
[7309.67s -> 7310.23s]  Get up.
[7314.18s -> 7314.82s]  Ow.
[7314.82s -> 7315.54s]  Ow.
[7315.54s -> 7316.82s]  Oh my god.
[7316.82s -> 7317.78s]  Oh, my stomach.
[7319.78s -> 7321.30s]  No, get me out of here.
[7322.58s -> 7324.58s]  Please get me out of here.
[7324.58s -> 7330.89s]  This game is fucking so much fun.
[7333.86s -> 7337.19s]  Nice sniper role.
[7340.15s -> 7340.63s]  Reload.
[7341.27s -> 7345.93s]  I'll be so far behind.
[7347.58s -> 7359.05s]  Open this.
[7360.25s -> 7365.77s]  I just like, come on.
[7366.49s -> 7367.53s]  Give me some slack here.
[7367.53s -> 7369.69s]  Give me at least a little bit of slack here.
[7369.69s -> 7372.65s]  That was like a random, oh, hey, give me a hug.
[7372.65s -> 7375.05s]  And then like, I'm missing my expensive rifle.
[7375.61s -> 7378.09s]  I had to put two and two together.
[7378.09s -> 7378.97s]  I didn't want to lose it.
[7378.97s -> 7380.09s]  That was expensive.
[7384.63s -> 7386.55s]  And then I looked over at chat and everyone's just like,
[7387.11s -> 7388.23s]  dude, no, he took it.
[7388.23s -> 7389.35s]  He fucking stole it, man.
[7389.35s -> 7390.47s]  That NPC steals it.
[7390.47s -> 7391.27s]  I'm just like, god.
[7393.03s -> 7393.59s]  Oh, god.
[7394.47s -> 7395.19s]  I was like, god.
[7395.19s -> 7396.07s]  And you guys were like, whoa.
[7396.07s -> 7396.87s]  And I was like, god.
[7397.83s -> 7398.71s]  Nice explanation.
[7403.69s -> 7405.77s]  I punched him in the head with the gun and I shot him in the head.
[7410.87s -> 7412.79s]  That was not supposed to happen.
[7412.79s -> 7414.73s]  It wasn't supposed to be like that.
[7415.69s -> 7422.02s]  So I got one arm.
[7423.62s -> 7428.92s]  All right.
[7428.92s -> 7430.82s]  I don't want to work my horse here.
[7433.35s -> 7433.75s]  Slow down.
[7433.75s -> 7434.23s]  Let's eat.
[7436.68s -> 7437.40s]  Reload this.
[7437.40s -> 7438.36s]  I can't.
[7438.36s -> 7439.56s]  I got to sleep in this bed.
[7441.40s -> 7442.20s]  I made the bed.
[7442.20s -> 7443.08s]  I got to sleep in it.
[7444.65s -> 7446.17s]  You can't shoot a rifle.
[7446.17s -> 7447.53s]  And look, this thing's like dirty.
[7447.53s -> 7449.21s]  I'm going to be so compulsive with this.
[7450.25s -> 7450.89s]  Is it clean?
[7450.89s -> 7451.61s]  I got to clean it.
[7452.57s -> 7457.83s]  Why is it damaged?
[7457.83s -> 7458.07s]  OK.
[7461.61s -> 7462.57s]  Reload it.
[7463.13s -> 7466.47s]  How do you reload?
[7477.66s -> 7479.34s]  It's circle is reload.
[7479.34s -> 7479.98s]  Ha!
[7479.98s -> 7480.94s]  Get me out of here.
[7484.89s -> 7493.51s]  This town hates me.
[7493.51s -> 7493.75s]  What?
[7493.75s -> 7495.59s]  Did I just go back in the same town I just left?
[7497.08s -> 7497.80s]  Get me out of this.
[7498.52s -> 7500.26s]  It's a never ending nightmare.
[7505.72s -> 7506.20s]  Please no.
[7506.20s -> 7507.08s]  Who said that?
[7507.08s -> 7509.54s]  They're probably talking about me.
[7510.34s -> 7515.06s]  I haven't even had an opportunity to cool off from that.
[7517.05s -> 7517.85s]  OK.
[7517.85s -> 7522.90s]  So the rifle, it's circle to reload.
[7523.70s -> 7524.50s]  Isn't it?
[7524.50s -> 7530.04s]  Well, you're holding setting story load game.
[7530.04s -> 7531.08s]  No, I can't.
[7531.08s -> 7532.60s]  That's no Ikea.
[7532.60s -> 7533.64s]  I got to sleep in this bed.
[7537.02s -> 7540.30s]  There are no rewinds in the Wild West, guys.
[7541.26s -> 7550.74s]  This guy only holds one bullet.
[7550.74s -> 7552.90s]  It doesn't have a hundred.
[7556.36s -> 7562.84s]  I bet that snakebite guy is feeling very good about himself.
[7562.84s -> 7564.12s]  Now he gave that to you.
[7564.12s -> 7574.38s]  I don't want to watch this stream anymore.
[7576.33s -> 7577.77s]  No, you sleep in bed.
[7578.41s -> 7578.73s]  OK.
[7579.61s -> 7580.57s]  What's happening here?
[7581.21s -> 7585.64s]  The farmer?
[7585.64s -> 7586.20s]  Where am I?
[7593.42s -> 7594.94s]  Mr. Thomas Downs?
[7594.94s -> 7595.90s]  No, it's the guy who owes money.
[7598.23s -> 7598.95s]  Oh, no, no.
[7602.49s -> 7604.65s]  We ain't a charity, Mr. Downs.
[7605.29s -> 7609.05s]  Why is he standing still?
[7610.47s -> 7611.27s]  Really?
[7611.27s -> 7612.23s]  Threaten me, would you?
[7613.59s -> 7614.31s]  Please.
[7614.31s -> 7615.51s]  I have a family, sir.
[7615.51s -> 7615.91s]  Please.
[7616.55s -> 7620.20s]  I don't care about your family.
[7621.40s -> 7624.22s]  Why did have to come to this, huh?
[7627.05s -> 7628.17s]  Tell me, sir.
[7628.17s -> 7629.37s]  I didn't want this either.
[7629.37s -> 7630.09s]  Just tell me.
[7631.05s -> 7631.77s]  Just tell me.
[7631.77s -> 7632.33s]  Tell me.
[7632.33s -> 7633.77s]  I don't want to hurt you, man.
[7633.77s -> 7634.97s]  I've done too much damage.
[7635.93s -> 7637.37s]  If you're running out on debt.
[7637.37s -> 7638.81s]  I don't want to hurt anybody anymore.
[7638.81s -> 7640.01s]  I'm not running anywhere.
[7641.86s -> 7643.22s]  I'm doing my best for you.
[7644.02s -> 7647.80s]  Or a slippery little bastard.
[7647.80s -> 7649.16s]  But I got you now.
[7650.04s -> 7650.44s]  Please.
[7651.08s -> 7651.40s]  Please.
[7652.20s -> 7653.08s]  Oh, fuck.
[7653.08s -> 7654.28s]  Be reasonable.
[7655.88s -> 7661.35s]  Okay, he's mine.
[7661.35s -> 7662.95s]  You borrowed money from my business partner,
[7662.95s -> 7663.99s]  Herr Strauss.
[7663.99s -> 7664.95s]  You owe him.
[7664.95s -> 7666.15s]  You took the money.
[7666.15s -> 7668.71s]  He wants it back what's not to understand.
[7671.27s -> 7672.86s]  Where's our money?
[7672.86s -> 7673.58s]  I don't have it.
[7675.34s -> 7676.22s]  Sell your place.
[7676.22s -> 7677.82s]  We already owe more than it's worth.
[7678.46s -> 7682.38s]  Then sell your wife or your family or something.
[7682.46s -> 7684.94s]  We ain't your idea of charity.
[7684.94s -> 7685.50s]  Is that clear?
[7688.60s -> 7689.08s]  Thomas.
[7689.80s -> 7691.00s]  What are you looking at?
[7691.00s -> 7691.56s]  Thomas.
[7692.12s -> 7693.48s]  I said what you looking at, woman?
[7693.48s -> 7694.68s]  My husband isn't well.
[7695.64s -> 7696.84s]  If we could just have more.
[7696.84s -> 7699.88s]  Like I said, we ain't nobody's idea of charity.
[7699.88s -> 7700.76s]  Get us the money.
[7713.18s -> 7714.30s]  Yeah, I didn't get it.
[7718.90s -> 7720.42s]  What if we're the bad guys?
[7721.46s -> 7722.02s]  I don't know.
[7722.98s -> 7731.53s]  I think he may have stolen your rifle.
[7742.38s -> 7743.74s]  Yeah, he's sick.
[7744.14s -> 7745.34s]  He like spit in my mouth.
[7746.22s -> 7747.18s]  I'm going to get the flu.
[7748.06s -> 7749.43s]  I'm going to get the death flu.
[7760.33s -> 7762.04s]  Back to camp.
[7762.84s -> 7770.90s]  So what's next?
[7774.92s -> 7776.12s]  Now they're running out of money here.
[7776.84s -> 7781.61s]  I'm going to donate this to the copper today.
[7795.13s -> 7796.01s]  I stole my gun.
[7800.47s -> 7802.31s]  Ah, how did you get on?
[7802.31s -> 7803.35s]  Not so good.
[7803.91s -> 7805.03s]  He's almost dead.
[7805.67s -> 7807.27s]  And they seem more or less destitute.
[7807.27s -> 7809.43s]  You were a fool for lending them the money.
[7809.43s -> 7811.19s]  Then people who aren't desperate
[7811.19s -> 7813.75s]  don't seem so interested in my propositions.
[7813.75s -> 7814.23s]  Of course.
[7815.91s -> 7825.96s]  Mission complete.
[7825.96s -> 7826.44s]  Bronze.
[7827.64s -> 7830.90s]  Arthur attempts to reclaim the debt from Thomas Downs
[7830.90s -> 7833.06s]  but finds him to be destitute.
[7833.78s -> 7834.98s]  Complete within two minutes.
[7836.10s -> 7837.54s]  Oh, that's because I wouldn't beat him up.
[7838.97s -> 7840.25s]  That's why I got bronze.
[7842.60s -> 7846.79s]  All right, let's go to the medic wagon here.
[7849.98s -> 7850.46s]  What we got?
[7851.34s -> 7852.06s]  Health cure.
[7853.42s -> 7854.22s]  I can't take any more.
[7857.98s -> 7859.74s]  How do I bathe at the camp, can I?
[7859.74s -> 7861.42s]  Oh, wait, actually, I have meat, don't I?
[7862.90s -> 7865.86s]  Oh, I bought that thing to do upgrades here.
[7867.86s -> 7868.66s]  Kit satchel.
[7868.66s -> 7869.30s]  Okay, I need...
[7870.18s -> 7871.30s]  Increase the carrying capacity
[7871.30s -> 7872.66s]  for all types of kit equipment
[7872.66s -> 7873.94s]  that will be used regularly.
[7875.06s -> 7877.22s]  This one is increase the carrying capacity
[7877.22s -> 7878.26s]  for all types of valuables
[7878.26s -> 7879.70s]  that can be sold for cash.
[7880.90s -> 7883.06s]  Perfect beaver, perfect beaver, perfect rabbit.
[7883.06s -> 7884.42s]  Something like this anywhere else.
[7885.54s -> 7888.57s]  I'll keep my eye out for some good food.
[7888.57s -> 7889.53s]  I'm gonna donate these, though.
[7889.53s -> 7891.61s]  I could really use some good meat for this stew.
[7891.61s -> 7893.77s]  Go to opossum, donate for funds,
[7893.77s -> 7895.53s]  donate for any provisions.
[7897.59s -> 7899.03s]  Oh, this shitty raccoon pal is good.
[7899.03s -> 7901.67s]  Sure, might as well make some money off it.
[7903.37s -> 7904.25s]  Get rid of the opossum.
[7907.78s -> 7909.72s]  Okay, let's go eat the stew
[7909.72s -> 7910.44s]  because it's available.
[7916.33s -> 7920.74s]  I'm trying to get over it.
[7920.74s -> 7921.14s]  I can't.
[7922.02s -> 7922.98s]  I'm trying, guys.
[7931.61s -> 7932.09s]  Let's eat.
[7935.85s -> 7936.73s]  Now slurp it up.
[7936.97s -> 7938.09s]  I want this right now.
[7942.58s -> 7946.26s]  What's with the same joke 100 times?
[7946.26s -> 7946.74s]  Which one?
[7950.06s -> 7950.78s]  Me?
[7950.78s -> 7951.58s]  Did I say something?
[7957.96s -> 7959.08s]  Oh, you're talking about chat.
[7959.08s -> 7959.48s]  Oh, okay.
[7959.48s -> 7965.34s]  Increase total supplies including tonics
[7966.14s -> 7970.38s]  to refill all stats as well as higher quality liquors.
[7973.51s -> 7977.93s]  Total provisions adds fresh fruit and basic canned goods.
[7977.93s -> 7978.65s]  Yeah, let's get this.
[7980.41s -> 7981.85s]  Quality and quantity of food available
[7981.85s -> 7982.97s]  in the pantry has increased.
[7982.97s -> 7983.37s]  That's good.
[7984.01s -> 7987.99s]  It's not a joke.
[7987.99s -> 7989.67s]  It's cold hard reality.
[7990.47s -> 7994.34s]  Whatever.
[7994.34s -> 7995.30s]  Real variety.
[7995.30s -> 7996.10s]  How much money do we have?
[7996.98s -> 8000.66s]  Proof of repeater ammo and arrows.
[8000.66s -> 8002.34s]  Actually, I like using the arrows.
[8003.14s -> 8006.87s]  48 bucks.
[8007.67s -> 8008.31s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[8009.19s -> 8011.43s]  Quality and quantity of ammunition available
[8011.43s -> 8012.39s]  at office 10 does increase.
[8012.39s -> 8015.11s]  You can pay to resupply munitions when stocks are low.
[8017.40s -> 8018.84s]  And then we're pretty much out of money.
[8023.27s -> 8025.51s]  I mean, we're broke, but I'm not broke.
[8026.31s -> 8027.03s]  So don't worry.
[8027.75s -> 8029.51s]  I'll take care of this.
[8030.23s -> 8035.14s]  Let's give some items here.
[8036.49s -> 8037.13s]  Eight bucks.
[8037.93s -> 8041.35s]  Put this one in there.
[8042.87s -> 8046.17s]  Gold pocket watch.
[8046.17s -> 8047.45s]  A couple of red wedding rings.
[8048.25s -> 8053.11s]  What's that face in chat?
[8055.06s -> 8056.26s]  We'll give like two of these.
[8058.55s -> 8059.11s]  That's enough.
[8059.67s -> 8060.55s]  How much money do they have?
[8061.75s -> 8062.15s]  $18.
[8063.35s -> 8065.22s]  That's fine.
[8065.78s -> 8066.71s]  That's enough.
[8067.27s -> 8072.90s]  Let's go to the ammo cart.
[8075.94s -> 8077.66s]  I need arrows.
[8077.66s -> 8078.86s]  Let's take these cartridges.
[8078.86s -> 8079.74s]  Arrows and everything.
[8080.38s -> 8083.99s]  All right.
[8083.99s -> 8086.25s]  I need, I didn't say arrows.
[8086.97s -> 8090.01s]  I need a bunch of these actually
[8090.01s -> 8090.65s]  because I used them all.
[8091.37s -> 8097.99s]  All right, we good.
[8098.63s -> 8099.43s]  Let's go to sleep.
[8100.39s -> 8102.55s]  And what time?
[8102.55s -> 8103.83s]  We've got five hours here.
[8103.83s -> 8105.11s]  Six and a half hours of streaming.
[8106.90s -> 8107.22s]  I'm good.
[8108.02s -> 8109.86s]  I think I'm going to get another water though.
[8109.86s -> 8110.90s]  So give me a second.
[8110.90s -> 8111.78s]  Let me go sleep.
[8111.78s -> 8113.06s]  Then I'm going to go BRB.
[8113.06s -> 8114.74s]  Grab another water and we'll keep going.
[8122.09s -> 8125.18s]  Sleep to morning.
[8126.78s -> 8130.02s]  Uh, I don't know how much I think is,
[8130.02s -> 8131.06s]  I need to be able to eat.
[8131.70s -> 8132.50s]  I haven't really eaten.
[8133.75s -> 8135.43s]  I had a smoothie this morning and that's it.
[8135.99s -> 8139.19s]  So eventually here, fairly soon,
[8139.19s -> 8141.75s]  I'm probably going to have to call it night.
[8141.75s -> 8143.82s]  It's including me.
[8143.82s -> 8147.53s]  I had a smoothie.
[8147.53s -> 8151.53s]  It was a pineapple, strawberry, and peach smoothie.
[8151.53s -> 8152.09s]  And it was good.
[8154.87s -> 8155.19s]  All right.
[8156.07s -> 8158.71s]  I'll probably give myself another 45 minutes
[8158.71s -> 8160.15s]  before it's time to end.
[8160.15s -> 8162.70s]  So with that, give me two seconds.
[8162.70s -> 8165.74s]  I'll see you guys in like a minute or two.
[8335.38s -> 8335.78s]  All right.
[8337.69s -> 8338.17s]  Yeah.
[8338.17s -> 8341.85s]  Probably because I got to take out Otto
[8343.90s -> 8346.98s]  and get some food and everything.
[8346.98s -> 8350.55s]  So we will do, let's do like another mission.
[8352.04s -> 8354.47s]  And then after that, close it up.
[8357.85s -> 8359.37s]  Somebody said, tired boy.
[8360.39s -> 8364.66s]  Yeah, I mean that, that, that my whole body,
[8364.66s -> 8365.46s]  it was taken out of me.
[8368.38s -> 8369.90s]  That last encounter just killed me.
[8370.14s -> 8372.38s]  Oh, okay.
[8372.38s -> 8373.50s]  So let's take a look.
[8373.50s -> 8374.62s]  This is morning now.
[8374.62s -> 8375.10s]  Let's see.
[8377.91s -> 8379.03s]  There are rabbits here though.
[8379.99s -> 8383.80s]  Let me try to get this challenge thing first
[8383.80s -> 8384.52s]  before we do anything.
[8390.09s -> 8390.81s]  Vroom, Vroom.
[8395.42s -> 8396.06s]  Vegas, baby.
[8397.53s -> 8399.67s]  All right.
[8399.67s -> 8401.03s]  I was supposed to just grab one of these.
[8401.03s -> 8401.51s]  Wait a minute.
[8402.15s -> 8405.35s]  At least let me see what it is.
[8408.95s -> 8409.99s]  Brown Jack.
[8411.03s -> 8412.31s]  Brown Broan.
[8414.28s -> 8415.40s]  Speednik said this thing's,
[8415.40s -> 8416.52s]  this thing's not even like good.
[8418.82s -> 8419.46s]  It's just big.
[8425.91s -> 8427.35s]  Hey, I'm trying to just let me pet you.
[8429.27s -> 8438.15s]  I feel like that Taima is a little bit better.
[8438.95s -> 8440.46s]  My horse is so much better.
[8441.18s -> 8443.74s]  I'm not that much better than Arthur's horses.
[8444.38s -> 8445.66s]  Okay, girl.
[8447.02s -> 8448.18s]  All right.
[8448.18s -> 8448.74s]  Now let's go.
[8448.74s -> 8450.10s]  I'm going to put my bow and arrow.
[8451.14s -> 8453.00s]  I'm going to get out of town first.
[8456.66s -> 8460.49s]  Okay.
[8460.49s -> 8461.13s]  Bow.
[8461.13s -> 8465.42s]  I need to be able to, I need to craft better arrows.
[8465.42s -> 8465.58s]  All right.
[8465.58s -> 8467.42s]  I need to, on horseback, I got to kill two rabbits.
[8467.42s -> 8468.46s]  The rabbits are over this way.
[8474.92s -> 8475.64s]  What was that blip?
[8478.33s -> 8478.89s]  Oh shit.
[8478.89s -> 8479.61s]  It's a snake.
[8479.61s -> 8480.25s]  It's a snake.
[8481.45s -> 8482.73s]  Study, study, study, study it.
[8484.87s -> 8486.63s]  Southern Copperhead Snake.
[8487.35s -> 8491.21s]  Where is it?
[8491.77s -> 8494.70s]  I don't know where it is.
[8494.70s -> 8495.10s]  Where is it?
[8495.74s -> 8498.98s]  There it is.
[8498.98s -> 8513.91s]  What?
[8513.91s -> 8517.13s]  Did the snake just die of old age?
[8518.49s -> 8519.61s]  How did it, wouldn't it die?
[8519.61s -> 8520.89s]  It hit his head on a rock.
[8527.94s -> 8528.34s]  Okay.
[8528.90s -> 8532.42s]  He just smashed his head into a fucking rock.
[8532.42s -> 8532.90s]  All right.
[8532.90s -> 8534.66s]  Well, look at the quality.
[8535.38s -> 8537.34s]  Look at the quality of the meat.
[8537.34s -> 8538.54s]  It's so, it's perfect.
[8538.86s -> 8539.34s]  It's perfect.
[8539.34s -> 8540.30s]  I'm going to bring it back to town.
[8542.12s -> 8542.36s]  No.
[8542.36s -> 8543.16s]  What do I do with this?
[8543.16s -> 8544.20s]  It's perfect.
[8544.20s -> 8545.24s]  Look at the three stars.
[8545.96s -> 8549.75s]  What do I do with this?
[8549.75s -> 8560.02s]  It's, it's, skin it?
[8560.02s -> 8561.38s]  Is it, will it be perfect skin?
[8561.38s -> 8562.58s]  Or should I just keep the whole thing?
[8568.66s -> 8571.14s]  Sell the butcher, cargo it, release it back into the wild.
[8572.18s -> 8573.94s]  Just hold it like this for the rest of the game.
[8574.66s -> 8578.02s]  It'll be a perfect skin.
[8578.90s -> 8581.24s]  All right.
[8581.24s -> 8581.56s]  Here we go.
[8581.56s -> 8582.20s]  I'm going to skin it.
[8599.19s -> 8600.07s]  Oh man.
[8600.07s -> 8600.39s]  Nice.
[8600.39s -> 8601.59s]  I can make perfect.
[8601.59s -> 8601.91s]  Okay.
[8602.87s -> 8605.51s]  I'm so glad he just smashed his head into a rock.
[8605.51s -> 8606.71s]  I didn't have to shoot it and ruin it.
[8607.51s -> 8610.18s]  Let's put it on the back.
[8610.82s -> 8613.85s]  Do I put it in a?
[8614.81s -> 8616.49s]  This thing's going to get all fucked up if I do,
[8616.49s -> 8617.77s]  if I drive stupid though, right?
[8623.42s -> 8624.14s]  Okay.
[8624.14s -> 8625.50s]  This is going to be rough.
[8625.50s -> 8626.54s]  I need to get rid of this somehow.
[8626.54s -> 8627.82s]  Should I go back to the camp?
[8628.86s -> 8636.78s]  Where's like a butcher?
[8638.49s -> 8639.45s]  Not my butcher.
[8640.25s -> 8642.17s]  A butcher that I can actually sell to.
[8642.89s -> 8646.95s]  Put it in the stew pot.
[8651.37s -> 8651.85s]  No, no.
[8651.85s -> 8652.73s]  I, let's go up here.
[8653.45s -> 8654.71s]  I'm going to go up.
[8654.71s -> 8655.19s]  But do that.
[8655.19s -> 8656.23s]  We're going to go up here.
[8656.23s -> 8658.71s]  I'm going to do this merry linden quest
[8658.71s -> 8660.07s]  and then I'm going to come back and get a rabbit.
[8661.11s -> 8663.77s]  All right.
[8663.77s -> 8664.09s]  Let's go.
[8664.97s -> 8670.01s]  I want to sell it at the butcher.
[8670.01s -> 8672.65s]  If it's perfect, then I kind of would want to get some money from it.
[8673.29s -> 8690.25s]  It's right on the road.
[8690.25s -> 8697.46s]  What the fuck are you doing, man?
[8699.90s -> 8701.74s]  What the fuck are you?
[8701.74s -> 8707.35s]  Oh, there's people.
[8707.35s -> 8707.99s]  Lots of them.
[8753.05s -> 8754.33s]  Everyone disliked that.
[8755.05s -> 8758.58s]  Maybe I get some money.
[8758.58s -> 8759.62s]  Oh, they're all Driscolls.
[8760.50s -> 8763.72s]  I mean, is there a point in this?
[8764.52s -> 8766.44s]  Where I get to get rid of all the Odoyles?
[8767.32s -> 8769.34s]  Can I throw them all off a cliff?
[8773.38s -> 8774.18s]  Edison?
[8774.18s -> 8774.50s]  Okay.
[8774.50s -> 8783.64s]  Not bad.
[8783.64s -> 8784.76s]  The Driscolls rule.
[8786.52s -> 8787.16s]  Seriously.
[8787.72s -> 8788.84s]  That's what I feel like they're doing.
[8795.90s -> 8797.26s]  I don't think I've had the same hat on
[8798.31s -> 8799.35s]  for more than five minutes.
[8802.50s -> 8803.70s]  They shot my snake?
[8803.70s -> 8804.34s]  I better not have.
[8805.22s -> 8805.86s]  No, it's still there.
[8805.86s -> 8806.18s]  It's fine.
[8806.90s -> 8810.09s]  It's still fine.
[8821.13s -> 8830.89s]  Holy shit.
[8835.77s -> 8837.05s]  Speaking of guns, what is that?
[8837.77s -> 8844.81s]  This is a Warren-Kattelman revolver.
[8844.81s -> 8845.37s]  No.
[8845.37s -> 8846.09s]  That thing sucks.
[8846.81s -> 8848.41s]  Oh, does it bounce?
[8848.41s -> 8850.01s]  So it was Driscolls,
[8850.01s -> 8851.05s]  and then it was bounties.
[8853.16s -> 8855.29s]  When are they going to realize
[8855.29s -> 8856.41s]  that they're not going to take me down?
[8856.41s -> 8858.01s]  They may as well just make me the president.
[8858.89s -> 8862.15s]  You know?
[8862.15s -> 8863.19s]  At what point is it just like,
[8863.19s -> 8864.23s]  fine, you can be emperor.
[8871.02s -> 8871.82s]  All right.
[8871.82s -> 8872.94s]  You're unstoppable.
[8872.94s -> 8874.46s]  You now, like that's what...
[8879.05s -> 8880.57s]  Sorry, I just ran into Tony Hawk
[8880.57s -> 8881.69s]  and show you how cool I was.
[8882.49s -> 8902.71s]  Pay off your bounties.
[8902.71s -> 8903.59s]  I'll do that here.
[8903.59s -> 8904.63s]  Do I have enough money to do that?
[8905.99s -> 8908.79s]  I didn't realize the United States was a monarchy.
[8909.51s -> 8911.75s]  No, but see, you make me the emperor
[8912.47s -> 8915.03s]  and then 10 of the most loyal,
[8915.03s -> 8916.15s]  most dedicated generals
[8916.15s -> 8917.83s]  then work to have me removed.
[8918.95s -> 8919.91s]  And then, you know,
[8919.91s -> 8921.43s]  while I'm sitting there eating grapes
[8922.71s -> 8924.55s]  and sleeping on like salted beef,
[8925.35s -> 8927.99s]  you just like throw a fucking dart in my face.
[8927.99s -> 8928.79s]  And that's it.
[8928.79s -> 8929.51s]  I'll get fat.
[8930.23s -> 8931.27s]  I'll get overconfident.
[8934.55s -> 8935.99s]  If you think your little spell away...
[8941.88s -> 8942.76s]  Look at that.
[8942.76s -> 8944.38s]  I'm not selling that though.
[8944.38s -> 8945.34s]  Perfect carcass.
[8952.89s -> 8953.85s]  What are you talking about?
[8954.49s -> 8956.38s]  Just read between the lines.
[8961.82s -> 8964.38s]  1.6, 1.7.
[8965.98s -> 8967.18s]  I can't do anything else with this.
[8967.18s -> 8968.46s]  So just take it.
[8969.02s -> 8970.06s]  I'm going to keep this though.
[8970.06s -> 8971.18s]  Does this spoil at all?
[8973.98s -> 8975.34s]  Or is it always going to be perfect?
[8982.26s -> 8983.94s]  Yeah, I'm not going to sell this to this guy.
[8983.94s -> 8986.26s]  No, I can use it anytime it says using crafting.
[8986.26s -> 8987.14s]  I'm not going to sell it.
[8988.81s -> 8990.07s]  Really have anything else for you.
[8997.61s -> 8998.25s]  What the hell?
[9001.61s -> 9002.49s]  Sell to the trapper?
[9002.49s -> 9003.05s]  Not this guy?
[9003.05s -> 9004.73s]  No, that's the skin though.
[9004.73s -> 9006.25s]  The carcass skin to use for anything.
[9006.97s -> 9011.19s]  Let's go to this one.
[9011.99s -> 9012.39s]  Actually, you know what?
[9012.39s -> 9013.99s]  I'm going to store this guy.
[9013.99s -> 9014.71s]  Actually, hold on a minute.
[9014.71s -> 9016.07s]  Let me like at least clean this.
[9016.87s -> 9018.07s]  I'm going to go bring Whisper up.
[9020.44s -> 9021.32s]  You are dirty.
[9024.68s -> 9039.26s]  Should I be holding this or tapping it?
[9054.47s -> 9056.07s]  Don't pay your bounty whatever you do.
[9058.47s -> 9059.35s]  Okay, nice and clean.
[9063.29s -> 9066.97s]  Let's get you in storage and bring out Whisper.
[9071.32s -> 9072.36s]  Good looking horse there.
[9073.00s -> 9074.60s]  If you want me to keep that overnight,
[9074.60s -> 9076.20s]  there's room in the stable.
[9076.20s -> 9077.24s]  Okay, here's Whisper.
[9078.44s -> 9079.00s]  Saddle up.
[9080.87s -> 9081.83s]  So here's Whisper.
[9083.13s -> 9086.86s]  I think I hate how I'm saying horse care package.
[9088.02s -> 9090.18s]  Wish more folks took care of their horses like you.
[9090.90s -> 9091.46s]  All right, that's good.
[9095.16s -> 9096.44s]  You have to stable your horses.
[9096.44s -> 9097.56s]  You can't just overuse them.
[9097.56s -> 9099.08s]  They'll get tired and fucked up.
[9102.57s -> 9108.44s]  I just want him to knock the board out of his hands.
[9108.44s -> 9109.32s]  I'm not trying to be dick.
[9112.52s -> 9114.44s]  Just trying to get the board knocked out of his hands.
[9116.92s -> 9117.72s]  Change the braided tail.
[9117.72s -> 9118.92s]  No, that's how I know it's my horse.
[9123.45s -> 9124.57s]  Your edgy horse.
[9126.50s -> 9128.66s]  Okay, let's go talk to Mary.
[9129.78s -> 9141.18s]  Hello.
[9141.18s -> 9142.95s]  We loved once in true.
[9144.23s -> 9145.59s]  Now, this is the love interest.
[9146.47s -> 9147.67s]  Oh shit, I forgot to take a bath.
[9150.14s -> 9150.46s]  Yes.
[9151.18s -> 9151.90s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[9151.90s -> 9153.58s]  I didn't mean to disturb you, ma'am.
[9155.11s -> 9156.95s]  Is Mrs. Linton in?
[9157.67s -> 9158.31s]  I'll go see.
[9161.69s -> 9164.81s]  Mrs. Linton, a caller for you.
[9164.81s -> 9166.33s]  The braided hair won't get tangled, I know.
[9168.02s -> 9168.42s]  I know.
[9169.14s -> 9173.59s]  Hello, Arthur.
[9174.39s -> 9176.84s]  Oh, you look like shit.
[9177.56s -> 9177.96s]  Mary.
[9178.68s -> 9179.56s]  I know, I know.
[9181.21s -> 9183.61s]  I heard you and your friends was around.
[9183.61s -> 9183.77s]  I...
[9184.73s -> 9185.05s]  Okay.
[9186.55s -> 9187.11s]  Where's, um...
[9187.83s -> 9189.29s]  Where's what's his name?
[9190.46s -> 9191.34s]  Died.
[9191.34s -> 9193.78s]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[9193.78s -> 9194.82s]  Yeah, me too.
[9195.86s -> 9196.34s]  Me too.
[9197.72s -> 9198.84s]  Happened a while ago.
[9200.28s -> 9201.00s]  Pneumonia.
[9201.00s -> 9202.20s]  Bad business.
[9202.20s -> 9202.52s]  Sure.
[9204.60s -> 9207.24s]  So, uh, you've been...
[9208.66s -> 9212.25s]  You've been made a widow and come here looking for me?
[9212.25s -> 9212.97s]  Is that it?
[9212.97s -> 9215.13s]  No, ain't like that, Arthur.
[9216.33s -> 9216.73s]  Okay.
[9219.02s -> 9221.10s]  Listen, Arthur, I...
[9222.42s -> 9222.74s]  I'm...
[9224.86s -> 9225.50s]  My family.
[9226.92s -> 9228.28s]  I need your help.
[9228.28s -> 9231.24s]  You mean the family that always looked down on me?
[9231.88s -> 9233.16s]  You want me to help them?
[9233.16s -> 9234.84s]  It's my little brother, Jamie.
[9235.64s -> 9238.23s]  I always liked Jamie.
[9238.87s -> 9240.55s]  At least compared to the rest of them.
[9241.27s -> 9247.30s]  He's broken daddy's heart.
[9248.10s -> 9248.90s]  Daddy has a heart?
[9248.90s -> 9250.82s]  Don't make me beg you, Arthur.
[9250.82s -> 9253.19s]  My money, my life, me.
[9254.07s -> 9255.51s]  I wasn't good enough.
[9255.51s -> 9256.15s]  I'm sorry.
[9256.15s -> 9257.27s]  This looks like it's deliberate.
[9257.27s -> 9258.87s]  We need your help real bad.
[9259.43s -> 9262.55s]  Little Jamie's joined the Chilonians.
[9262.55s -> 9264.39s]  That strange religious order.
[9264.39s -> 9266.63s]  I've rolled around in mud before I walked to the door.
[9266.63s -> 9267.59s]  That's like how fresh that is.
[9267.59s -> 9268.71s]  They'll kill him.
[9268.71s -> 9271.27s]  You're the only person he'd listen to.
[9271.27s -> 9275.75s]  So, I'm too rough to marry into your family.
[9275.75s -> 9278.71s]  But it's okay to ask me to help in saving your family.
[9278.71s -> 9279.51s]  I'm sorry.
[9280.07s -> 9282.31s]  I understand if you don't want to help me, but...
[9283.03s -> 9285.27s]  But I think of you often.
[9286.07s -> 9288.22s]  No time will go now.
[9288.22s -> 9289.74s]  I'm begging you, Arthur.
[9290.30s -> 9292.54s]  I say let Jamie live Jamie's life
[9292.54s -> 9295.58s]  and not the nightmare that his daddy dreamed up for him.
[9295.58s -> 9297.74s]  Jamie's so innocent, Arthur.
[9299.34s -> 9301.67s]  Please, Arthur.
[9304.66s -> 9305.54s]  Will you help me?
[9310.39s -> 9314.50s]  I think I got to help her, right?
[9316.79s -> 9317.59s]  I don't know.
[9317.59s -> 9318.39s]  I got to...
[9318.39s -> 9319.51s]  Oh, it's don't help her.
[9319.51s -> 9320.63s]  It's the first coming up here.
[9320.63s -> 9321.83s]  Please, Arthur.
[9322.89s -> 9323.85s]  Oh, shit.
[9323.85s -> 9324.81s]  Time's running out.
[9324.81s -> 9325.21s]  I'm helping.
[9325.21s -> 9325.71s]  Where is he?
[9327.06s -> 9329.70s]  Somewhere out near Carmody Dell, I think.
[9329.70s -> 9332.50s]  The rancher there said he'd seen him around the Cumberland forest.
[9332.50s -> 9334.10s]  I mean, good boy points, guys.
[9334.10s -> 9335.06s]  Don't you understand?
[9335.06s -> 9338.90s]  Arthur, if you find him, bring him to me at the station.
[9338.90s -> 9340.10s]  I'll see what I can do.
[9340.10s -> 9341.22s]  I can't just do everything bad.
[9341.22s -> 9341.62s]  I need to...
[9341.62s -> 9342.90s]  I've done so many bad things.
[9345.22s -> 9346.26s]  You already owe me.
[9349.82s -> 9350.78s]  Good boy points.
[9353.10s -> 9353.82s]  Come on.
[9353.82s -> 9355.13s]  Look, don't you understand?
[9355.13s -> 9359.13s]  For every time that we run over a fucking town of people in our car,
[9360.09s -> 9364.28s]  for every time I shoot my tuba desk at somebody, like on the street,
[9364.92s -> 9366.20s]  we have to balance it out.
[9367.32s -> 9374.17s]  I have to do a good deed every once in a while.
[9374.17s -> 9376.01s]  And this is far away, Mary.
[9383.72s -> 9384.76s]  Okay, Thanos.
[9386.44s -> 9392.42s]  You can't just do all bad things.
[9392.98s -> 9403.50s]  Good idea.
[9403.50s -> 9404.14s]  No.
[9404.14s -> 9412.25s]  He's got to be occasionally good so he doesn't stand for anything.
[9413.21s -> 9422.55s]  Rated tails messing with your head.
[9423.43s -> 9424.49s]  Why?
[9424.95s -> 9432.78s]  He was thinking about blasting the lady on the porch.
[9432.78s -> 9433.34s]  I could see it.
[9434.46s -> 9436.26s]  And I didn't do it.
[9441.05s -> 9442.89s]  That's not part of my bad guy allowance.
[9456.57s -> 9457.63s]  Okay.
[9459.85s -> 9460.35s]  I tried.
[9462.25s -> 9463.05s]  I tried to kill her.
[9468.90s -> 9469.40s]  Okay.
[9471.86s -> 9472.42s]  God damn it.
[9472.42s -> 9473.30s]  I was in the middle of something.
[9480.98s -> 9485.69s]  Awful evil?
[9485.69s -> 9487.69s]  I don't know if that's the kind of character I'm playing.
[9487.69s -> 9488.81s]  That horse did right by me.
[9489.77s -> 9491.69s]  Better than my husband, truth be told.
[9492.41s -> 9494.41s]  That fool always complaining.
[9494.41s -> 9496.33s]  But does he do something about it?
[9496.33s -> 9496.81s]  Whatever.
[9496.81s -> 9497.53s]  It don't matter.
[9497.53s -> 9499.69s]  Barely lifts his hand to wave the flies away.
[9499.69s -> 9501.45s]  Actually, I am kind of playing like evil.
[9502.81s -> 9504.33s]  Marriage for me has been nothing but trouble.
[9504.33s -> 9505.69s]  He did a lot of dangerous shit.
[9506.41s -> 9507.13s]  But Biscuit?
[9507.93s -> 9509.37s]  He was a fine animal.
[9510.25s -> 9511.05s]  Jumping over stuff.
[9512.33s -> 9513.37s]  Flying over cars.
[9513.37s -> 9514.97s]  Flying over, you know, jumping over ranches.
[9514.97s -> 9515.69s]  And stuff like that.
[9515.69s -> 9519.61s]  No one had one of them mountain boys pull a gun on me once.
[9525.50s -> 9528.30s]  Koda and it stopped by a nice warm patch.
[9529.10s -> 9529.98s]  What the fuck is that rabbit?
[9534.94s -> 9537.18s]  I mean, if you want to be like lawful evil, evil enable.
[9537.18s -> 9538.86s]  I wake up and find some nasty piece of work
[9538.86s -> 9541.26s]  pointing a rusty shotgun straight at me.
[9542.06s -> 9545.42s]  Well, he gets wheezing on and I must have made some sort of noise.
[9545.50s -> 9548.62s]  Because, well, you quit it already.
[9548.62s -> 9550.14s]  Think you might have got 20.
[9550.14s -> 9551.42s]  What is wrong with you?
[9557.35s -> 9557.91s]  Oh, yeah.
[9559.27s -> 9560.87s]  Jump over three obstacles in 15 seconds.
[9562.15s -> 9564.89s]  I tell the husband, what does he do?
[9564.89s -> 9565.61s]  What does the time start?
[9565.61s -> 9567.94s]  You've never gone over there.
[9567.94s -> 9568.50s]  Over the tree.
[9568.50s -> 9569.80s]  Thanks.
[9569.80s -> 9570.92s]  Over the rock.
[9570.92s -> 9572.36s]  You aiming and knocked me off.
[9572.36s -> 9572.86s]  One.
[9575.34s -> 9576.94s]  Emerald ranches the other way.
[9577.58s -> 9578.08s]  Anyways.
[9578.70s -> 9579.20s]  Right.
[9579.66s -> 9581.99s]  For the time being.
[9581.99s -> 9582.49s]  Again.
[9609.59s -> 9611.67s]  Jump over three obstacles in 15 seconds.
[9621.82s -> 9622.94s]  That's not part of the balance.
[9632.06s -> 9636.30s]  How do you jump over the three objects in 15 seconds?
[9636.30s -> 9639.26s]  I have to go to like a stable for that.
[9643.14s -> 9644.18s]  Jesus Christ.
[9646.18s -> 9648.57s]  Just jump over a fence three times.
[9648.57s -> 9649.45s]  I panicked.
[9649.45s -> 9651.05s]  I saw the fucking text on the screen.
[9651.05s -> 9652.41s]  I thought it was like a GT.
[9652.41s -> 9654.57s]  Remember in Grand Theft Auto when they would do the random like,
[9654.57s -> 9658.25s]  hey, by the way, pass four people in 10 seconds.
[9658.25s -> 9659.45s]  And you're like, oh shit, oh nice.
[9661.45s -> 9670.17s]  That happens all the time in GTA 5.
[9670.73s -> 9672.58s]  Especially, well, GTA Online, right?
[9682.06s -> 9682.86s]  Yeah, I'm sorry here.
[9685.88s -> 9687.08s]  GTA, yeah, GTA Online.
[9687.96s -> 9694.46s]  I bet I'm going to meet all the people I've helped in the afterlife.
[9707.75s -> 9714.09s]  Well, the shell of safety.
[9715.05s -> 9716.01s]  What am I supposed to do?
[9716.01s -> 9717.21s]  Shell of safety.
[9717.21s -> 9719.10s]  Shell of safety.
[9719.10s -> 9720.14s]  Can I speak to the boy?
[9720.86s -> 9721.58s]  Arthur?
[9721.58s -> 9722.30s]  Hello, son.
[9723.10s -> 9725.05s]  Your sister is very worried.
[9725.77s -> 9728.71s]  The boy has chosen a path, sir.
[9728.71s -> 9729.43s]  Cultist shield.
[9730.47s -> 9731.03s]  Okay, let's see.
[9731.03s -> 9731.67s]  Guy on the left.
[9733.37s -> 9734.81s]  Guy in the back is the most intimidating back left.
[9734.81s -> 9736.25s]  His sister just wants to speak with him.
[9736.97s -> 9739.88s]  Arthur, I've chosen a path.
[9740.52s -> 9741.96s]  Yeah, that's the big, the big group.
[9741.96s -> 9744.28s]  The boy has chosen a path.
[9744.28s -> 9746.04s]  He's chosen safety.
[9747.08s -> 9749.56s]  What path have you chosen, sir?
[9750.60s -> 9753.05s]  Oh, browns.
[9753.85s -> 9758.84s]  No, about this nonsense.
[9758.84s -> 9760.12s]  Let me speak to the boy.
[9761.88s -> 9765.24s]  Are you always this negative and antagonistic, sir?
[9766.44s -> 9769.08s]  I'm sorry.
[9770.60s -> 9773.21s]  Don't you, ma'am.
[9773.21s -> 9774.84s]  Forgive me, please.
[9776.68s -> 9780.95s]  I am a fool for my god and a happy one, sir.
[9781.75s -> 9782.86s]  Bless you.
[9782.86s -> 9783.50s]  Use God.
[9783.50s -> 9784.22s]  No.
[9784.22s -> 9785.90s]  What do I dream about?
[9786.54s -> 9788.70s]  Who are my heroes?
[9789.74s -> 9791.74s]  Uh, Spider-Man.
[9794.57s -> 9794.97s]  Fools.
[9795.61s -> 9798.25s]  You're a fool for everyone's god.
[9798.25s -> 9799.37s]  You're a maniac.
[9799.37s -> 9801.93s]  Now let me talk to the god damn boy.
[9802.89s -> 9808.38s]  Move out of my way.
[9808.38s -> 9809.70s]  Fool?
[9809.70s -> 9812.39s]  What does throttle mean?
[9813.27s -> 9814.71s]  God damn lunatic.
[9816.17s -> 9816.89s]  Kill him.
[9817.77s -> 9821.77s]  That's enough, Arthur.
[9822.57s -> 9823.53s]  Kid, come on.
[9823.53s -> 9824.17s]  Did I kill him?
[9824.17s -> 9824.81s]  This is crap.
[9824.81s -> 9825.85s]  You're better than this.
[9825.85s -> 9826.65s]  Better than what?
[9827.29s -> 9829.05s]  Better than one in paradise?
[9829.05s -> 9832.65s]  Better than thinking these fools know a damn thing about paradise.
[9832.65s -> 9833.37s]  Now he's done.
[9833.37s -> 9834.41s]  Now let me take you home.
[9834.41s -> 9836.25s]  You're a sad man, Arthur.
[9836.25s -> 9837.53s]  You're a real sad man.
[9838.25s -> 9839.85s]  Sure, but come home.
[9839.85s -> 9840.81s]  Not a chance.
[9842.41s -> 9845.21s]  Leave me alone, Arthur.
[9845.21s -> 9847.46s]  I didn't ask for your help.
[9847.46s -> 9847.96s]  Yah!
[9848.66s -> 9853.88s]  I'll get him.
[9853.88s -> 9854.38s]  Yah!
[9855.70s -> 9857.14s]  He ain't gonna outrun Whisper.
[9859.06s -> 9862.73s]  My horse is way fucking faster than yours, ain't it?
[9863.69s -> 9866.87s]  Oh.
[9866.87s -> 9867.37s]  Hey!
[9868.07s -> 9874.49s]  Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!
[9875.05s -> 9879.06s]  You're just using it.
[9879.06s -> 9880.65s]  Tell you what you want to hear.
[9880.65s -> 9883.03s]  Why did they throw all these obstacles in my way?
[9883.03s -> 9884.23s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[9900.73s -> 9916.66s]  I wasn't gonna kill him.
[9916.66s -> 9917.16s]  I'm kidding.
[9920.42s -> 9921.78s]  Obviously have to lasso him.
[9921.78s -> 9922.58s]  Just gotta get close enough.
[9922.58s -> 9923.70s]  Sorry I didn't understand.
[9924.26s -> 9926.58s]  There's gonna be a lookout for the obstacle on the road.
[9927.38s -> 9928.42s]  Of course he gets by it.
[9930.84s -> 9932.84s]  You're just using it.
[9932.84s -> 9934.84s]  Tell you what you want to hear.
[9934.84s -> 9943.67s]  Why do your sisters worry about you?
[9943.67s -> 9945.42s]  This is none of your damn business.
[9945.42s -> 9946.46s]  Oh!
[9946.46s -> 9949.70s]  I tried to run him over.
[9949.70s -> 9951.46s]  Just get old, get on with it.
[9965.67s -> 9967.77s]  This is crazy.
[9967.77s -> 9968.27s]  I can't get it.
[9968.27s -> 9968.81s]  Come on, Yates.
[9968.81s -> 9971.77s]  Stupid, you can see this is crazy.
[9971.77s -> 9973.05s]  You're the crazy one.
[9973.93s -> 9974.43s]  Yah!
[9977.24s -> 9979.32s]  Dammit, we gotta do this the hard way.
[9979.96s -> 9981.56s]  I don't have to answer to you.
[9981.56s -> 9986.57s]  The fastest horse in the game.
[9986.57s -> 9998.70s]  The horse is gonna die.
[10026.30s -> 10027.82s]  Not a good idea, not a good idea.
[10046.49s -> 10048.89s]  Oh, what did he say?
[10052.89s -> 10055.61s]  Now you're fucked.
[10062.46s -> 10068.22s]  What are we doing?
[10070.09s -> 10070.73s]  What are we doing?
[10073.80s -> 10076.86s]  Slowly press R2 to fill the meter.
[10076.86s -> 10078.06s]  The more full the meter the...
[10078.70s -> 10079.34s]  What?
[10079.34s -> 10079.84s]  Slowly.
[10095.80s -> 10096.76s]  Let me read this again.
[10096.76s -> 10097.64s]  Hold on, I freaked out.
[10097.64s -> 10098.68s]  What is he telling me?
[10098.68s -> 10099.18s]  Load?
[10102.44s -> 10107.14s]  Slowly press R2 to fill the meter.
[10107.14s -> 10108.10s]  The more the meter...
[10119.94s -> 10121.22s]  Okay, I need to like do that again.
[10121.22s -> 10122.74s]  I don't even know what he's trying to tell me to do.
[10133.00s -> 10136.12s]  You can't, you can't, you can't do it.
[10136.12s -> 10136.92s]  I'm gonna do it.
[10142.49s -> 10142.99s]  Jesus.
[10143.87s -> 10146.03s]  The one thing I do know.
[10146.03s -> 10148.38s]  Is he gonna give him the gun back?
[10150.22s -> 10151.74s]  I'll miss you Arthur.
[10151.74s -> 10153.34s]  I don't know if I would give that back to him.
[10153.34s -> 10153.98s]  Are you and Marys sweet on another again?
[10157.53s -> 10159.53s]  That's all a long time ago son.
[10161.31s -> 10161.87s]  Let's go.
[10162.67s -> 10164.11s]  We're on my horse, right?
[10164.11s -> 10167.39s]  Well, this wasn't how I thought today would turn out.
[10167.95s -> 10170.51s]  It's been a long time, Jamie Gillis.
[10171.31s -> 10173.31s]  You were a kid last time I saw you.
[10174.19s -> 10176.19s]  Didn't try to change something.
[10176.27s -> 10179.31s]  You know, you taught me how to ride a horse.
[10180.03s -> 10183.63s]  To uh, lonier though?
[10184.27s -> 10184.77s]  Really?
[10185.31s -> 10186.35s]  You'd fall for that?
[10186.91s -> 10188.59s]  They were very nice to me.
[10189.63s -> 10190.35s]  They're decent.
[10190.91s -> 10191.63s]  I'm sure.
[10192.51s -> 10194.59s]  Please tell me you didn't give them any money.
[10195.55s -> 10196.99s]  Desk tube is not gone.
[10197.71s -> 10199.16s]  It's right here.
[10199.16s -> 10200.12s]  Of course I did.
[10200.92s -> 10202.92s]  They rely on charitable donations.
[10203.48s -> 10205.16s]  Jesus, Jamie.
[10205.16s -> 10205.66s]  Come on.
[10206.36s -> 10208.68s]  I just wanted to believe that there might be something good
[10208.68s -> 10209.88s]  come on my way one day.
[10210.44s -> 10211.96s]  Yes, that's dead in the water.
[10212.68s -> 10214.12s]  It's the turtle.
[10214.12s -> 10214.60s]  Shut up.
[10215.64s -> 10219.82s]  Father kept telling me was you won't amount to anything.
[10219.82s -> 10221.34s]  You're not enough of a man.
[10221.34s -> 10222.62s]  I had to get away.
[10222.62s -> 10224.83s]  I couldn't take you anymore.
[10224.83s -> 10228.76s]  Forgive me, but your father's a bully and a coward.
[10228.76s -> 10230.20s]  Don't listen to him.
[10230.20s -> 10231.72s]  Hey, don't talk about him like that.
[10232.44s -> 10234.68s]  What do you want me to say, Jamie?
[10234.68s -> 10235.80s]  He's a good father.
[10236.44s -> 10237.80s]  Nice man.
[10237.80s -> 10239.24s]  He won't be happy I saw you.
[10240.12s -> 10242.76s]  Please send him my worst regards.
[10242.76s -> 10244.04s]  Jump three obstacles.
[10244.04s -> 10245.96s]  I'm not going to do that right now.
[10245.96s -> 10247.32s]  I'm not good at anything.
[10248.12s -> 10250.28s]  I'm going to get to a fence and then get it done.
[10250.28s -> 10251.40s]  Tell me something you like.
[10252.36s -> 10255.53s]  Don't think too hard.
[10255.53s -> 10256.49s]  Don't fall here.
[10256.49s -> 10258.01s]  Apples, I guess.
[10258.01s -> 10259.37s]  You like apples?
[10259.37s -> 10260.57s]  Yeah, I love apples.
[10261.45s -> 10261.95s]  Okay.
[10262.65s -> 10264.49s]  Well, I was thinking more along the lines of
[10264.49s -> 10265.61s]  Somebody's got to love apples.
[10265.61s -> 10267.21s]  You know, people that own apple farms.
[10267.21s -> 10268.09s]  You got to really love them.
[10268.09s -> 10268.81s]  All right, go work in the office.
[10268.81s -> 10269.93s]  Where do you think your apples come from?
[10269.93s -> 10270.97s]  That's respectable.
[10271.13s -> 10273.61s]  You must really like shooting and robbing people.
[10274.25s -> 10277.45s]  I only like shooting young idiots who run away from me
[10277.45s -> 10279.13s]  when I'm trying to help them.
[10279.13s -> 10280.65s]  You told me what you do.
[10281.37s -> 10283.13s]  I'm sure he did.
[10283.13s -> 10286.51s]  Are you still with Dutch and what was his name?
[10286.51s -> 10287.39s]  Hester?
[10287.39s -> 10288.35s]  Jose.
[10288.35s -> 10290.99s]  Yep, still the same sort of.
[10290.99s -> 10292.51s]  And Annabelle and Bessie?
[10293.23s -> 10294.67s]  I'm afraid they're dead.
[10295.47s -> 10295.87s]  Shit.
[10295.87s -> 10296.91s]  Doesn't count.
[10296.91s -> 10298.99s]  Maybe Mary did make the right choice.
[10300.03s -> 10300.91s]  No doubt.
[10302.80s -> 10306.48s]  It is anything like the nonsense you read in the newspapers.
[10307.20s -> 10309.20s]  So, are you two getting back together?
[10309.76s -> 10310.96s]  I told you no.
[10312.16s -> 10313.52s]  Just ask me for a favor.
[10313.52s -> 10316.16s]  I had from valentine's words in less than five minutes.
[10316.80s -> 10317.52s]  Pneumonia.
[10318.24s -> 10319.44s]  You told me.
[10319.44s -> 10322.00s]  So the door is open, so to speak.
[10322.00s -> 10323.52s]  Okay, well, I got a really fast horse.
[10323.52s -> 10324.64s]  Might be able to do that.
[10324.64s -> 10325.76s]  Different people now.
[10326.48s -> 10327.60s]  She's not.
[10327.60s -> 10329.12s]  And you seem just the same.
[10329.68s -> 10332.80s]  Well, maybe that right there's the problem.
[10332.80s -> 10334.48s]  She was always too good for me.
[10335.12s -> 10336.88s]  Let's just get you back to your sister.
[10336.88s -> 10338.64s]  She's waiting at the station for us.
[10340.35s -> 10341.55s]  Meet Mary at the station.
[10341.55s -> 10343.15s]  She must be waiting inside.
[10347.20s -> 10352.65s]  Hello.
[10352.65s -> 10354.57s]  Mary, I brought your son.
[10355.53s -> 10356.80s]  What are you going, the long way?

[10359.64s -> 10363.00s]  He's going the long way here.
[10363.00s -> 10364.94s]  You're right.
[10364.94s -> 10366.06s]  Why is he limping around?
[10366.78s -> 10371.68s]  I seem to recall hearing mention of that myself.
[10371.68s -> 10372.24s]  Okay, come on.
[10374.09s -> 10375.53s]  All right, here's your rotten kid.
[10384.94s -> 10385.74s]  Because he shot his hand.
[10385.74s -> 10386.86s]  I didn't just shoot his hand.
[10386.86s -> 10387.82s]  I didn't even touch his hand.
[10387.82s -> 10388.38s]  It hit the gun.
[10389.10s -> 10391.02s]  Jamie, Jamie.
[10391.66s -> 10392.46s]  All right.
[10392.46s -> 10394.30s]  Finally, mother and son reunited.
[10394.30s -> 10395.02s]  Please.
[10395.02s -> 10398.14s]  You've father's been very sad.
[10398.14s -> 10400.78s]  Father wouldn't know sadness if it died in his bed.
[10400.78s -> 10401.50s]  He's not happy.
[10402.30s -> 10404.30s]  But I'll come home for you.
[10404.30s -> 10406.78s]  My boy, my sweet boy.
[10407.98s -> 10408.46s]  Come on.
[10410.51s -> 10411.31s]  Oh, Arthur.
[10412.83s -> 10413.31s]  Thank you.
[10414.43s -> 10414.99s]  Thank you.
[10415.79s -> 10418.14s]  It's good to see you, Mary.
[10418.14s -> 10419.26s]  And you, Arthur.
[10419.98s -> 10420.70s]  And you.
[10421.66s -> 10424.97s]  Have a good one.
[10426.49s -> 10427.21s]  No, don't skip.
[10442.06s -> 10442.94s]  Oh, you don't have to say anything.
[10442.94s -> 10446.22s]  I'm going to long scope you from like a half mile away when you get on the train.
[10446.22s -> 10446.86s]  Don't worry about it.
[10447.74s -> 10476.11s]  I feel like the luckiest man alive and I feel like a fool.
[10477.39s -> 10482.59s]  That woman confuses me and plays me for a fiddle like no one else alive.
[10483.23s -> 10487.28s]  I trust I will not make a god-awful fool of myself once more.
[10487.28s -> 10491.96s]  But somehow I imagine I shall.
[10493.58s -> 10493.98s]  Somehow.

[10524.01s -> 10529.40s]  So I I'm probably just going to go tomorrow.
[10530.12s -> 10530.68s]  You know what I'm saying?
[10534.04s -> 10543.29s]  Try to keep this going because we've got.
[10543.29s -> 10546.81s]  Yeah, it was before I turned the stream up before I made Starplane Leap League.
[10550.20s -> 10554.19s]  But yeah, this looks pretty promising so far.
[10554.99s -> 10557.66s]  It's been very solid tonight.
[10558.22s -> 10561.90s]  I think it's only dropped 100 frames over six, seven hours.
[10561.90s -> 10563.02s]  That's pretty great, actually.
[10564.38s -> 10565.10s]  Show Otto.

[10568.22s -> 10569.18s]  He's downstairs.
[10569.18s -> 10570.46s]  He's like asleep downstairs.
[10570.46s -> 10571.58s]  I really don't know.
[10571.58s -> 10572.94s]  I'm going to let him just hang out down there.
[10573.74s -> 10576.38s]  I don't want to like wake him up, bring him up here, and then bring him all the way.
[10576.38s -> 10581.88s]  No, I'll show him tomorrow with this.
[10581.88s -> 10586.92s]  If we still have a solid internet connection here, then tomorrow I'm just going to stream.

[10602.40s -> 10603.76s]  Like I want to let my dog sleep.
[10603.76s -> 10606.40s]  I don't want to like drag him up here and like put him in front of a camera.

[10609.77s -> 10610.01s]  What?
[10612.17s -> 10613.61s]  He's just like sleeping.
[10613.61s -> 10614.97s]  He's being like a good boy.

[10646.36s -> 10647.08s]  That's the wrong thing.
[10647.08s -> 10647.80s]  That's an outro.

[10869.10s -> 10870.46s]  Closer to the Wi-Fi router.
[10871.10s -> 10875.55s]  Man, wouldn't that be weird?
[10876.99s -> 10878.75s]  Closer to the Wi-Fi router.
[10882.12s -> 10882.52s]  Thank you.
[10884.36s -> 10886.44s]  Thank you Optimus for the one dollar.
[10886.44s -> 10887.48s]  Optimus 27,000.
[10888.12s -> 10891.60s]  This stream really makes you feel like it's 2014.
[10891.60s -> 10893.36s]  The days of Jerma versus Star.
[10893.36s -> 10896.72s]  Bets, pirate spies, and demonic chefs.
[10896.72s -> 10897.66s]  Good to be back.
[10899.76s -> 10900.40s]  We never left.
[10900.96s -> 10902.28s]  Never left, man.
[10902.28s -> 10903.32s]  We're here.
[10903.32s -> 10906.40s]  I didn't go anywhere.
[10906.40s -> 10907.52s]  He didn't go anywhere.
[10907.52s -> 10909.02s]  It's all good.
[10911.96s -> 10914.12s]  Thank you 4th consecutive lion for the five dollars.
[10915.24s -> 10917.08s]  Damn, this stream reminded me of the good old days.
[10917.08s -> 10919.16s]  Hope you stream with Stirr more often.
[10919.16s -> 10921.20s]  I'm sure we will.
[10921.20s -> 10922.41s]  There's no reason not to.
[10923.13s -> 10925.21s]  Just need to find the right game, the right time, the right moment.
[10925.21s -> 10926.65s]  Organically, like I told you before.
[10927.29s -> 10930.68s]  There's no rhyme or reason to when I play with somebody else.
[10930.68s -> 10931.72s]  It just kind of happens.
[10931.72s -> 10932.84s]  But thanks for the five dollars, man.
[10932.84s -> 10933.24s]  Appreciate it.
[10934.67s -> 10935.23s]  Hexbred.
[10935.23s -> 10936.03s]  Thanks for the three dollars.
[10936.03s -> 10936.59s]  Hexbred.
[10936.59s -> 10937.47s]  It just says neat.
[10938.11s -> 10939.44s]  Hey, thanks.
[10939.44s -> 10942.00s]  Thank you Hexbred for your three bucks.
[10942.00s -> 10942.64s]  And you're neat.
[10943.28s -> 10945.76s]  Moseloss.
[10945.76s -> 10947.36s]  Thank you Moseloss for the one dollar.
[10947.36s -> 10948.08s]  Great stream, Jeremy.
[10948.08s -> 10950.24s]  Always fun watching you and Star play Lethal League.
[10950.24s -> 10953.52s]  Now go watch the Patriots beat Aaron Rodgers.
[10954.24s -> 10956.22s]  I think I may have missed that game.
[10956.78s -> 10959.18s]  Yeah, that was more than three hours ago.
[10959.18s -> 10959.74s]  Did they win?
[10960.46s -> 10961.18s]  I don't know.
[10961.74s -> 10964.80s]  Did they win?
[10964.80s -> 10967.95s]  I don't really follow football.
[10967.95s -> 10969.39s]  I follow baseball sometimes.
[10972.76s -> 10973.40s]  Spoiler.
[10973.40s -> 10975.32s]  Oh yeah, I don't want to give spoilers.
[10976.36s -> 10977.00s]  Thanks a lot, man.
[10978.20s -> 10979.16s]  Thank you Felix.
[10979.16s -> 10980.12s]  Felis for the five dollars.
[10980.12s -> 10981.88s]  Sorry that five cents is all I can give you.
[10982.52s -> 10984.52s]  But I need to eat dinner tonight, Jerma.
[10984.52s -> 10985.32s]  Jerma Hart, buddy.
[10986.91s -> 10988.27s]  This is not five cents.
[10988.27s -> 10989.79s]  This is five dollars.
[10991.26s -> 10991.58s]  I don't know.
[10991.58s -> 10993.66s]  You may have messed up the denomination there.
[10993.66s -> 10994.22s]  Sorry about that.
[10994.22s -> 10996.70s]  But thank you for the five bucks, man.
[10996.70s -> 10997.20s]  Appreciate it.
[11000.64s -> 11001.20s]  Zalinky.
[11001.20s -> 11002.64s]  Thank you, Zalinky, for the one dollar.
[11003.28s -> 11003.84s]  No message.
[11003.84s -> 11004.32s]  Thank you, though.
[11005.47s -> 11006.19s]  Angry Ork.
[11006.19s -> 11007.55s]  Thanks for four bucks.
[11007.55s -> 11008.19s]  No message.
[11008.19s -> 11008.99s]  Thank you so much.
[11010.75s -> 11011.79s]  Rip that guy's dinner.
[11012.96s -> 11013.92s]  A Blue Comet.
[11013.92s -> 11016.08s]  Thanks for the ten dollars here, Blue Comet.
[11016.08s -> 11018.97s]  Ten bucks from Blue Comet.
[11018.97s -> 11020.25s]  Chat stole your gun.
[11023.50s -> 11029.76s]  You know, I like those moments where you like you.
[11030.40s -> 11032.88s]  I just know I'll never live it down ever again.
[11033.60s -> 11035.10s]  And it's live.
[11035.98s -> 11038.46s]  I can't like go back and fix that.
[11038.46s -> 11038.94s]  You know what I mean?
[11041.40s -> 11042.52s]  If this was YouTube, I'd be like,
[11042.52s -> 11044.44s]  oh, shit, that was really fucking bad.
[11044.44s -> 11046.04s]  That was really fucked up and stupid.
[11046.04s -> 11047.32s]  Oh, I was going to go delete it.
[11048.12s -> 11048.44s]  Nope.
[11050.46s -> 11052.94s]  Well, that's going to take me like a month
[11052.94s -> 11053.82s]  to live that one down.
[11057.20s -> 11059.04s]  But thank you, Blue Comet, for the ten bucks.
[11059.04s -> 11059.60s]  Appreciate it.
[11060.81s -> 11063.45s]  Little Money Larry gave fifteen dollars here.
[11063.45s -> 11064.97s]  Thank you so much for fifteen bucks, man.
[11067.40s -> 11068.28s]  You look like shit.
[11068.28s -> 11069.08s]  Perfect timing.
[11069.08s -> 11069.72s]  I snotted.
[11069.72s -> 11070.76s]  That was great.
[11070.76s -> 11073.56s]  And then they say blood for blood.
[11074.28s -> 11074.60s]  God.
[11076.46s -> 11076.96s]  What?
[11077.18s -> 11079.29s]  But thank you, though.
[11081.45s -> 11081.93s]  A month.
[11081.93s -> 11082.41s]  Keep dreaming.
[11082.41s -> 11083.69s]  It's going to take five years.
[11086.24s -> 11086.96s]  God.
[11086.96s -> 11090.70s]  He just wanted a hug.
[11090.70s -> 11091.26s]  I know.
[11091.26s -> 11093.18s]  But like the way that he reached around
[11093.18s -> 11096.14s]  and then like it wasn't on my back anymore.
[11096.14s -> 11096.62s]  And who knows?
[11096.62s -> 11098.38s]  There's all kinds of weird characters
[11098.38s -> 11099.98s]  and weird fucked up scenarios.
[11099.98s -> 11100.78s]  It could have happened.
[11103.90s -> 11105.90s]  Chat is still on Coffee Cheetos Chicken.
[11105.90s -> 11106.94s]  What are you on about?
[11107.74s -> 11108.46s]  Oh, that's right.
[11110.44s -> 11112.52s]  Okay, so that one, if Coffee Cheetos Chicken,
[11112.52s -> 11115.56s]  like finally like like at the end of its life,
[11115.72s -> 11116.92s]  two years from now is done,
[11116.92s -> 11118.12s]  then this one's going to be ten years.
[11119.55s -> 11120.19s]  I just said it.
[11120.99s -> 11122.27s]  Now it just resets the time.
[11122.27s -> 11124.11s]  So like I just gave it another five years.
[11124.91s -> 11127.28s]  Every time it's mentioned, the clock resets.
[11131.36s -> 11134.32s]  And then at the end here, thank you Snatchy for the one dollar.
[11135.04s -> 11136.48s]  I bet she's going to meet all the other people
[11136.48s -> 11137.84s]  you've helped in the afterlife.
[11137.84s -> 11138.64s]  Mentioned that before.
[11138.64s -> 11140.00s]  That's a funny, that was a funny comment.
[11140.80s -> 11143.20s]  And in the very end, thank you E Cookie for the one dollar.
[11144.83s -> 11148.03s]  Can you watch and react to your 500 subscriber special?
[11148.99s -> 11151.55s]  No, I've done, I've done it like three times.
[11152.81s -> 11153.37s]  I can't.
[11154.17s -> 11156.57s]  You want it?
[11156.57s -> 11157.45s]  No, I'm not.
[11157.45s -> 11158.73s]  I'm not going to give any ideas.
[11159.45s -> 11162.68s]  I'm going to close my mouth on that one.
[11165.04s -> 11165.52s]  You want it?
[11165.52s -> 11166.32s]  You wanted me to watch?
[11166.32s -> 11167.12s]  You want me to watch that?
[11169.88s -> 11170.44s]  Hmm.
[11170.44s -> 11171.80s]  I wonder how that would be possible.
[11172.44s -> 11178.43s]  Oh, I'm not, I don't know.
[11180.36s -> 11182.92s]  Guys, the old shitty annotations about
[11182.92s -> 11184.84s]  me correcting the amount of pounds it is.
[11185.56s -> 11187.00s]  These are 35 pound dumbbells.
[11187.00s -> 11187.64s]  It's 30 actually.
[11187.64s -> 11188.52s]  I'm sorry, I lied.
[11189.96s -> 11194.91s]  Those annotations are still there.
[11194.91s -> 11196.27s]  But that's it for the bits.
[11196.27s -> 11202.72s]  Thank you everybody for your monetary contributions.
[11202.72s -> 11203.68s]  Thanks to the bits, everybody.
[11204.24s -> 11204.96s]  You guys all rock.
[11205.92s -> 11208.08s]  And let's go ahead and throw the credits up on the screen.
[11208.88s -> 11210.40s]  I got a feeling it's going to be a lot.
[11210.40s -> 11211.92s]  It's going to probably be going real fast.
[11213.28s -> 11216.00s]  But thank you regardless to everybody that subscribes to the channel.
[11216.00s -> 11216.88s]  You guys are all amazing.
[11217.96s -> 11218.68s]  And here it comes.
[11221.87s -> 11223.39s]  Thank you for supporting the stream.
[11223.39s -> 11224.03s]  All you guys.
[11224.83s -> 11229.15s]  I just, I locked up when I looked at it.
[11229.15s -> 11230.03s]  Fucking god damn it, man.
[11231.15s -> 11232.03s]  It's been a long time.
[11232.99s -> 11233.55s]  Thank you.
[11234.35s -> 11235.95s]  I just was staring at the webcam.
[11235.95s -> 11236.99s]  That's why I don't do webcam.
[11237.96s -> 11244.72s]  If the webcam was on, thank you everybody.
[11246.96s -> 11247.84s]  I went like this.
[11247.84s -> 11248.80s]  No, I'm not going to turn it on yet.
[11248.80s -> 11250.48s]  I want to see everybody.
[11252.30s -> 11253.18s]  You guys are all amazing.
[11253.74s -> 11255.88s]  Hello tall streamer.
[11255.88s -> 11256.36s]  Thanks, man.
[11261.80s -> 11263.24s]  Why is my music not on?
[11263.24s -> 11265.85s]  What the fuck?
[11265.85s -> 11267.05s]  So what was the green screen update?
[11267.05s -> 11267.53s]  I missed it.
[11269.04s -> 11271.04s]  After we, I will reiterate it one more time.
[11273.60s -> 11279.77s]  But don't want to give the subs some time to go by here.
[11284.83s -> 11285.31s]  All of you.
[11288.30s -> 11298.89s]  When I came back actually streaming three days or so, it was later like 300 or 400 subs.
[11299.69s -> 11306.36s]  Were a lot of you guys just like saving it to when I actually came back?
[11306.36s -> 11309.80s]  At what point were you like, okay, I'm going to wait until he comes back.
[11310.36s -> 11311.64s]  He ain't, he ain't back.
[11312.44s -> 11313.64s]  What the fuck is he doing?
[11318.65s -> 11322.09s]  People remember like October, like all of October.
[11322.09s -> 11325.29s]  I barely stream just because of all this, you know, moving and everything.
[11325.29s -> 11328.33s]  And I, people still paid for that whole month of subscriptions.
[11329.68s -> 11330.32s]  Tons of you guys.
[11330.88s -> 11334.78s]  So then I didn't really do very much.
[11334.78s -> 11337.15s]  So thank you for your patience.
[11340.24s -> 11345.02s]  Thanks for continuing to support the stream, even when the stream and even turned on.
[11345.02s -> 11359.76s]  So that means a lot, but it seems like we are back in the saddle.
[11360.94s -> 11364.06s]  Judging by all the testing that we did yesterday and then today,
[11365.98s -> 11367.58s]  let's hope that it's a done deal.
[11368.62s -> 11374.24s]  I can't afford it every month.
[11375.36s -> 11376.40s]  You don't have to be subbed, man.
[11377.20s -> 11379.08s]  Make sure you take care of yourself first.
[11379.08s -> 11384.76s]  Make sure that anything that you give to me is something that you can afford.
[11384.76s -> 11387.40s]  Something that it's, you are completely comfortable doing.
[11388.28s -> 11391.53s]  Oh shit, it auto subbed.
[11391.53s -> 11392.81s]  Can I get a free fund?
[11396.62s -> 11397.50s]  That was a lot of people.
[11400.00s -> 11400.72s]  Thank you so much.
[11401.28s -> 11406.52s]  I'm a poor university student.
[11406.52s -> 11410.28s]  I can't afford something, which is why I look forward to survey bits to show my support.
[11411.24s -> 11412.68s]  That's perfectly fine, man.
[11412.68s -> 11413.72s]  Thank you for even doing that.
[11418.96s -> 11423.28s]  There's no obligation for you to continuously give me money.
[11424.92s -> 11426.92s]  I appreciate anything that you would even say.
[11428.80s -> 11429.44s]  So thank you.
[11431.26s -> 11432.06s]  Triple Jupiter.
[11432.06s -> 11432.54s]  Holy shit.
[11434.84s -> 11435.56s]  That likes it, man.
[11435.56s -> 11436.04s]  You got it.
[11436.76s -> 11438.46s]  What's all this facing here though?
[11438.46s -> 11440.30s]  Is that an emote problem?
[11441.26s -> 11442.22s]  Oh no, is it dash?
[11442.22s -> 11442.72s]  Okay.
[11443.92s -> 11445.68s]  Only a few days until Hitman 2.
[11445.68s -> 11446.48s]  Well, I'd better.
[11447.92s -> 11449.44s]  Oh, so many things to do.
[11449.44s -> 11450.88s]  There's so much to do.
[11450.88s -> 11452.88s]  This is what happens when you don't stream for a month.
[11453.60s -> 11454.80s]  So many fucking things come out.
[11454.80s -> 11457.28s]  So many things that I have been backlogged.
[11460.11s -> 11461.55s]  The end of the year here will be a lot of fun.
[11462.11s -> 11463.21s]  There's a lot to do.
[11464.16s -> 11466.16s]  But I am going to take off.
[11466.16s -> 11468.08s]  Right at the very end, mostly loss came in with the dollar.
[11468.08s -> 11469.92s]  Oops, this was the last dollar in my bank account.
[11469.92s -> 11470.88s]  Whoa, that's not good.
[11471.84s -> 11472.96s]  Whoa, thank you though.
[11474.48s -> 11476.08s]  Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the one dollar.
[11477.32s -> 11479.08s]  Your special stream, return my heart.
[11480.73s -> 11482.25s]  And this is an image of me.
[11484.24s -> 11485.44s]  Oh, what?
[11487.93s -> 11488.33s]  Why is...
[11490.99s -> 11492.11s]  I was supposed to be eating the microphone.
[11492.11s -> 11492.43s]  Okay.
[11493.31s -> 11494.67s]  Why does it just link that?
[11494.67s -> 11495.47s]  I just linked that.
[11495.47s -> 11496.19s]  Why did I do that?
[11498.04s -> 11498.68s]  I...
[11498.68s -> 11499.64s]  Whatever.
[11499.64s -> 11501.32s]  Thank you E-Cookie for the one dollar at the end here.
[11501.32s -> 11503.08s]  Do 4,000 subs special.
[11504.51s -> 11505.79s]  A fourth like on Twitch?
[11506.59s -> 11509.29s]  I don't have 4,000 subs on Twitch.
[11509.37s -> 11511.37s]  If that's what you're referring to.
[11514.64s -> 11515.68s]  But thank you.
[11515.68s -> 11517.50s]  It came pretty close.
[11517.50s -> 11520.54s]  There was like a month or two ago.
[11520.54s -> 11521.74s]  Like before I moved.
[11522.54s -> 11523.34s]  Holy shit.
[11524.38s -> 11526.06s]  I think we got real close to it.
[11526.06s -> 11527.66s]  Maybe we went over for one day or something.
[11531.82s -> 11535.20s]  But and that's just fucking out of this world.
[11535.20s -> 11536.08s]  I can't even imagine that.
[11536.96s -> 11538.72s]  But how do you check my subs?
[11539.52s -> 11543.79s]  I think it has 3,900.
[11543.79s -> 11545.71s]  I did not have 3,900.
[11545.71s -> 11550.88s]  That was during the spicy move.
[11552.72s -> 11553.84s]  Hey, why are you ending the stream?
[11553.84s -> 11554.88s]  I just got here asshole.
[11554.88s -> 11555.92s]  Hey, whoa, man.
[11556.96s -> 11558.72s]  Oh my goodness.
[11559.52s -> 11560.32s]  What the hell is it?
[11560.32s -> 11562.72s]  Hey, you got like an eight hour VOD that's ready to go.
[11563.52s -> 11565.92s]  And hey, that was two full different games here.
[11565.92s -> 11568.16s]  It was me and Stirr playing Lethal League.
[11568.16s -> 11568.96s]  Which was a lot of fun.
[11568.96s -> 11570.48s]  And then some Red Dead Redemption 2.
[11570.48s -> 11572.40s]  Man, you got like eight hours here, man.
[11574.08s -> 11575.04s]  Permaband, no.
[11576.08s -> 11576.40s]  All right.
[11576.40s -> 11577.36s]  I will see you guys tomorrow.
[11577.36s -> 11578.32s]  Oh, Garfield here.
[11578.32s -> 11579.12s]  Garfield the Monday Kill.
[11579.12s -> 11580.24s]  Thanks for the one dollar Garfield.
[11581.20s -> 11583.28s]  I made a comic for you and for Holymac.
[11583.76s -> 11584.48s]  Let's see what it is.
[11588.60s -> 11589.80s]  Good morning, Holymac.
[11589.80s -> 11590.36s]  All right.
[11591.08s -> 11592.04s]  Good morning to you.
[11593.21s -> 11594.33s]  Pushito.
[11594.33s -> 11595.29s]  Who the fuck is this?
[11595.29s -> 11596.89s]  Love me, love my mask.
[11596.89s -> 11597.37s]  What is this?
[11601.93s -> 11604.33s]  I saw a guy call you bad earlier and you banned him.
[11605.29s -> 11607.05s]  Well, I mean, for those of you that are new to the channel,
[11609.45s -> 11612.01s]  the permanent ban, a life ban.
[11612.89s -> 11616.17s]  If I denominate a permanent life ban, it's 15 seconds.
[11617.05s -> 11618.81s]  That's a life sentence.
[11618.81s -> 11621.29s]  So if you're new to the channel, that's what happens.
[11622.01s -> 11627.79s]  Trevor doesn't know how to read.
[11634.97s -> 11636.49s]  Find some treasure next time.
[11636.49s -> 11638.01s]  Yeah, we'll do some side content tomorrow.
[11641.10s -> 11642.46s]  I will try to find some treasures.
[11642.46s -> 11643.50s]  We'll do some hunting.
[11644.22s -> 11647.44s]  I'll try to start at some point in the afternoon.
[11647.44s -> 11650.48s]  Again, like I've said before, the schedule is just throw it out the window for now.
[11651.76s -> 11660.00s]  Until I have the 100% all clear that the internet is 100% fixed and ready to go,
[11660.72s -> 11662.00s]  I still don't have that information.
[11662.64s -> 11667.04s]  The Cox tech guy that I've been talking to has been all over it and on top of it.
[11667.04s -> 11670.96s]  Well, there's no confirmation here yet that, oh, hey, by the way, it's actually done.
[11671.92s -> 11674.72s]  Once that's done and once that's completely, we're in the complete clear,
[11675.52s -> 11676.48s]  I'm going to have a new schedule.
[11676.48s -> 11678.67s]  So we'll figure it out.
[11680.12s -> 11681.16s]  Have a great rest of your night, guys.
[11681.16s -> 11681.56s]  Take care.
[11682.20s -> 11685.96s]  I'm going to go eat food, let my dog out and say hello to my girlfriend.
[11686.76s -> 11688.36s]  I think she's downstairs.
[11689.32s -> 11690.57s]  Take care, guys.
[11690.57s -> 11691.37s]  Have a great rest of your night.
[11710.65s -> 11711.05s]  Bye.
