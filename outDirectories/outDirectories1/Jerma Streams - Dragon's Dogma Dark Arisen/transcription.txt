[1.72s -> 12.10s]  Hi, I know, I'm sorry, I know it's like 351 pacific time. I fucking fell asleep, I took a nap,
[12.98s -> 19.29s]  I got up, I went back to bed, and you know when you just sometimes you just take a nap
[20.33s -> 26.41s]  and then not everything turns off. Your brain, your eyes, your nose, your mouth, it all just
[26.41s -> 35.03s]  shuts off. I rolled around and it's like oh it's like it's like three ten. It's like oh
[36.49s -> 47.42s]  what oh okay. Gotta get the fuck out of this bed. Can't stay awake for more than an hour?
[49.98s -> 60.54s]  God. 4 p.m time to go to bed. But anyways, there are some very very fun things.
[61.70s -> 67.88s]  Reason why my sleep schedule is so screwed up is because I was in the discord a couple days
[67.88s -> 75.16s]  ago or yesterday morning because I had stayed up and I was getting all kinds of cool shit ready.
[76.28s -> 82.04s]  Got like the sometimes I just get the itch like once every couple weeks or so to just
[82.84s -> 86.76s]  I want to have like a notepad and I want to find out like some fun things to do on stream
[86.76s -> 92.38s]  and that's what I did. I was in the discord at like six or seven o'clock in the morning
[92.38s -> 97.02s]  pacific talking just like oh hey so here's like some fun things. People are just like
[97.02s -> 107.21s]  what the fuck are you doing? I'm just like oh yeah I'm good. I fell asleep. But we're
[107.21s -> 114.97s]  gonna play Dragon's Dogma. It's one of the things. Also expect a Dreamcast conversation
[114.97s -> 120.78s]  here in about two seconds. Just about two seconds. Unless we get into the menu of
[120.78s -> 126.78s]  Dragon's Dogma. And I think a lot of people are not gonna like the Dreamcast conversation
[127.50s -> 130.54s]  because I didn't realize a handful of things about this system.
[131.50s -> 140.30s]  Two very important things. Important thing number one. A majority of the popular
[141.26s -> 148.62s]  releases for the Dreamcast have been ported to PC and upgraded. We're talking about Shenmue,
[148.62s -> 158.01s]  Space Channel 5, Knights, Crazy Taxi. They're all on PC. So oh and they look better.
[158.81s -> 166.66s]  They have a higher graphic fidelity. Uh oh. Problem number two. Actual Dreamcast video
[166.82s -> 174.94s]  games that you would buy on Amazon or eBay. Um some of them are over $150 each because
[174.94s -> 179.18s]  apparently the Dreamcast collectors it's a pretty big deal because they're pretty rare.
[180.06s -> 189.34s]  So most of the good good Dreamcast games that you can't get on PC that you can only
[189.34s -> 200.33s]  get on Dreamcast. A majority of them are over $50 to $75. Emulation is an option but here's
[200.33s -> 206.01s]  why I don't like emulating anything past PlayStation 1. Every time I always have some
[206.01s -> 213.13s]  kind of problem. Either it doesn't capture well, frame rate problems, crashes. I every time.
[213.69s -> 221.80s]  The post of PlayStation 1 era of emulators I always have an issue with them. So what I did
[221.80s -> 230.60s]  is I went ahead and I bought them. I bought a bunch of Dreamcast games. I had in the closet
[230.60s -> 238.12s]  back there already. I didn't buy look I didn't buy any like the $150 ones. Like the ones
[238.12s -> 247.99s]  that are like $125 each. No. But the Dreamcast is going to be one of those scenarios where we
[247.99s -> 253.83s]  don't just oh hey remember PlayStation 3? It has like 60 fucking games. That's not going
[253.83s -> 261.16s]  to happen. There will be like 10 fun Dreamcast games and I'm not just going to burn through
[261.16s -> 268.26s]  them. I'm going to play them. There are a couple of survival horror games that are only on the
[268.26s -> 273.18s]  Dreamcast that I think would be really fun to see. There are a couple of fighting games.
[273.18s -> 277.10s]  There are Power Stone is on the Dreamcast and it's a ton of fun. I'm not just going
[277.10s -> 280.78s]  to play it for five minutes like we did some of the other PlayStation 2, PlayStation 1 games.
[282.06s -> 289.06s]  Seaman. Yes. The microphone. And by the way the you want to talk about expensive.
[290.58s -> 299.19s]  The Seaman microphone is almost $100. The Dreamcast microphone it's like a piece of plastic
[299.99s -> 305.37s]  with like a bird shit on the top of it and you stick it into the the VMU thing and it's like
[305.37s -> 317.45s]  70 fucking dollars. Why? Well I think we're really collecting that and there's no other way
[317.45s -> 325.03s]  to get it to work. You have to use it. And speaking of which one of the there's a highly
[325.03s -> 329.19s]  requested game that I've been seeing in the recommendation channel. People have said it to me
[329.19s -> 333.19s]  over the course of the last couple of years. I'm finally going to play it. I bought it. I bought
[333.19s -> 337.43s]  all the necessary stuff to make sure it actually works. I'm going to play Lifeline
[337.43s -> 341.59s]  for PlayStation 2 and we're going to try to beat that whole game. That's also coming up
[341.59s -> 350.28s]  here. If you don't know what that is that is a it's a game where you control the whole
[350.28s -> 361.43s]  thing with your voice. Good luck with a Boston accent. Well as you can see I can get
[361.43s -> 368.95s]  rid of my accent very quickly and very easily and the tone of my voice I can do a standard
[369.59s -> 376.01s]  speaking voice so it should be able to pick up all of the it should be able to pick up
[376.01s -> 386.38s]  all of the things I am saying. Hey take a look at that there's uh there's Dragon's Dogma.
[386.86s -> 397.54s]  Oops why is it not there? Okay now it is. Dragon's Dogma uh this was another one of
[397.54s -> 405.22s]  those that was on the list for a long time. I figured it's it's time to start to play some
[405.22s -> 412.17s]  of the games on the list. Also also he's been he's been doing research for like two days.
[413.83s -> 418.39s]  Dark Souls 3. I'm gonna play Dark Souls 3 again at some point over the next week or so.
[418.39s -> 423.27s]  Well who who cares? Dark Souls 3 what you beat that game like twice on stream. I know
[423.27s -> 428.63s]  I beat the game on stream twice on stream. Uh we're gonna do mods. First person mod comes
[428.63s -> 442.63s]  to mind. I really want to see how that game is in first person so that's what we're gonna do.
[442.63s -> 448.87s]  We also got all the Dreamcast. We got Shenmue. Shenmue is I I got it on PC. We've got crazy
[448.87s -> 459.34s]  taxi. This is I got like a bunch of shit ready to go now. All the Dreamcast games. I've got
[459.34s -> 464.55s]  like 10 of them. Let's see if we can get that started maybe tomorrow like I guaranteed.
[466.71s -> 471.08s]  Wait what are we doing? What what even is this game? Okay quest log.
[471.80s -> 475.16s]  Using a lantern will hold darkness at bay. Press back to open your inventory.
[476.97s -> 482.57s]  Okay so there's uh items that restore health and stim and I'll go with my lantern.
[483.45s -> 493.14s]  Is that the lantern right there? There it is. It's 0.60 cents a small light source.
[493.78s -> 501.69s]  Let me go ahead and use it. Change the game I did. Why does it still say I'm playing Celeste?
[504.66s -> 515.70s]  Wait wait what is it? Because it says Dragon's Doggo for me. Yeah what? It says right
[516.02s -> 524.60s]  it's Dragon's Dogma. Dragon's Dogma Darkerism. Okay what if I yeah it's it's there.

[730.04s -> 734.84s]  Breathe fire. Blew up a building in front of him and he was still doing the default walk.
[736.60s -> 739.64s]  Some ledges may be scaled but long fall will end in injury or death.

[1150.98s -> 1158.18s]  close by and hidden away here for fear of beasts all around. But with you we cannot suffer
[1158.18s -> 1166.82s]  a worm to work any further atrocities. Our army is routed. This plain truth. Beyond that grand
[1166.82s -> 1176.31s]  door the dragon makes its roost. Okay I know it's gonna happen. We're all gonna die.

[1346.97s -> 1380.10s]  Right in the head. A symbol. Well I'm the party tank.
[1391.24s -> 1394.94s]  Goat's head's almost dead. I'm gonna climb up.
[1401.10s -> 1414.39s]  Goat's head has been killed. Get up there. Oh get up.
[1435.21s -> 1438.01s]  This is actually monster hunter. It kind of is.

[1900.44s -> 1906.76s]  So let's take a look at the voices here. Okay. Sounds pretty gruffy. That's pretty good man.

[1943.32s -> 1959.34s]  face selection. There we go. Like the beard and the hair.
[1972.25s -> 1994.95s]  It's not literally Gandalf. Okay. This is. I don't even remember his name. Barth?
[1995.51s -> 2003.54s]  What's this guy's name? I like this one. Hold on I gotta see more of him.

[2083.11s -> 2108.55s]  ones. Oh my god. That's fucking terrifying. I feel like this is the next John Wick movie.
[2110.38s -> 2114.38s]  They're gonna. You think they're gonna stop at three? No. They're gonna make a John
[2114.38s -> 2130.52s]  Wick 4 and it's gonna be when he's like fucking 75. Yeah they better have a blue star
[2130.52s -> 2140.06s]  wizard robe option or I'm leaving. Me too. I will exit the game. Hmm this is tough.
[2142.57s -> 2150.04s]  Uh I like. I like these ones. No these ones are way better. Those are my actual eyes.
[2152.60s -> 2164.52s]  That's what my visor actually looks like. That's kind of scary. Okay vertical spacing.
[2165.16s -> 2191.94s]  All right. No I'm not gonna make. What's the. What's that movie? Uh Attila? No that's not.
[2191.94s -> 2199.34s]  No not Attila. I'll. I'm not making an Alita character okay. That's gonna be a weird movie
[2199.34s -> 2215.62s]  to watch. This is just a bird. Yeah Alita battle angel. Fine. What does Alita's eyes.
[2215.62s -> 2237.80s]  What color does Alita have for eyes? Is it red? Okay here we go. Looks good. Okay brows.
[2243.03s -> 2260.23s]  That does not fit. This this is a head transplant. Okay can I do details? Yeah
[2260.23s -> 2272.81s]  vertical spacing. This is gonna be a very very odd reference but maybe somebody will.
[2273.37s -> 2288.07s]  Is this Dr. Parnassus? Does anybody know who that is from that movie? That's a movie that
[2288.07s -> 2303.43s]  nobody saw but that this is just Dr. Parnassus. That looks good. Look at all these pictures.
[2305.61s -> 2318.42s]  These are all so fucked up looking. No no I'm not. No he's not. He's not getting a.
[2318.42s -> 2325.61s]  He's not getting a cute nose. Sorry. He has to get like a dwarf nose.
[2336.39s -> 2344.09s]  Actually I kind of liked it the way it was. Maybe one. Yeah right there.
[2348.46s -> 2366.15s]  Like right in the middle. All right looks good. Mouth is important. This is uh what you're looking
[2366.15s -> 2374.39s]  at here is a great crazy grandpa got your iPhone and was taking a selfie but accidentally because
[2374.39s -> 2395.38s]  he's so old took the shutter take a hundred photos button. Do details on this one. Boy
[2395.38s -> 2408.25s]  that's not bad. I think that's fine. Ears. You can't even see the ears.
[2408.89s -> 2420.54s]  What? No it's not gonna. It should be maybe an elf. No Gandalf wasn't an elf. All right.
[2422.09s -> 2430.76s]  Hairstyle. Let me look at this one more time. Details. Okay 24 is the right one. Or is it?
[2444.90s -> 2451.59s]  Okay can you give can you give them can you give characters in this game to see a haircut?
[2451.59s -> 2455.35s]  Is it possible? I don't think it is.
[2467.83s -> 2482.89s]  You can change the hair later. See ya. See a haircut. No I don't. No no no.
[2486.33s -> 2496.38s]  All right just keep going. Preset bodies.
[2511.22s -> 2530.17s]  Give him a huge jacked body. No that doesn't work like that. He can he can this character
[2530.17s -> 2538.58s]  can stay in Ren and Stimpy where he belongs. My character is gonna be no that's too easy.
[2545.26s -> 2552.39s]  It's too easy to just make like a fat guy or I'm huge you know. I mean I have to keep him
[2554.01s -> 2562.55s]  normal but out of shape normal. Wait I can make it what? Oh I thought you could change
[2562.63s -> 2574.71s]  just the color of his like chest. Okay that's fine. Statue. Height.
[2580.22s -> 2586.31s]  No we're gonna make him normal okay. No we're not gonna make him huge. We're gonna make him
[2586.31s -> 2604.34s]  normal. 141 centimeters is how tall? That's what? That's four foot nine. Is this inches?
[2607.03s -> 2614.30s]  No that's we're gonna keep him normal. Not small. We're gonna keep him in the normal range.
[2616.50s -> 2635.94s]  This is fine. This is normal. Weight. Okay. Musculature. Pretty good. Torso. Now fucking
[2635.94s -> 2644.55s]  with the torso fucks with the way you've made his face. Although I do really like the coat
[2644.55s -> 2668.34s]  hanger though. Not realistic. We'll have to go for two. Two's fine. So all right should I just
[2668.34s -> 2677.66s]  make jacked dad? This is jacked dad body. You know the guy that's like in his late 40s
[2678.38s -> 2683.86s]  and can't wait to go to the resort pool to take the shirt off because he has like really defined
[2683.86s -> 2694.55s]  shoulders. A fat stomach. And like a big chest. Yeah I think I'm gonna make resort casino dad.
[2695.27s -> 2711.77s]  Yeah I gotta go back to the stomach. Where is it? Torso?
[2720.84s -> 2732.33s]  No where was it? It was back. Statue? Okay here it is. No it needs to be less defined.
[2740.65s -> 2759.29s]  That's that's better. There we go. Huge fucking arms. Although this is this is pretty good resort
[2759.29s -> 2766.54s]  casino dad too because some they don't even work out your arms. You just do you just do like
[2768.28s -> 2784.78s]  curls and and then you do like the chest. No this is perfect. No that's much better. Not
[2784.78s -> 2792.36s]  another frog. Is he just he is turning into a frog isn't he? Wicked skinny legs. No I'm not
[2792.36s -> 2800.65s]  gonna do one of the fat ones. We've been doing Kenshi body again. No these are good. All right
[2800.65s -> 2814.54s]  I'm gonna fix this. I'm not doing Kenshi body. I promise. See? I told you I wasn't gonna do
[2814.54s -> 2833.32s]  Kenshi. Stance. No nobody has posture that good. It hurts to have posture like this.
[2837.08s -> 2853.37s]  That's fine. Stance. Ladylike or macho? All I'm doing is just lifting my arms up a little
[2854.33s -> 2867.86s]  and giving myself duck feet. How's that do? You want to learn how to be macho? Just raise your
[2867.86s -> 2880.89s]  hands up a couple of degrees above your waist and then pivot your toes. Okay and it features
[2880.89s -> 2901.13s]  scars, wrinkles, facial hair. This is actually pretty detailed. Oh no scars. That that implies
[2901.13s -> 2904.81s]  that I that implies that I may have lost a battle. Oh I haven't even been touched.
[2905.96s -> 2928.17s]  I'm untouchable. Nobody can hit me. Boy that's all right. 23. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. I
[2928.17s -> 2956.18s]  don't I no get the beard back. It's the hair. It's the hair that's doing that. This hair just
[2956.18s -> 2967.61s]  is so terrible. All right that's fine. The beard we had before was perfect. I think that's
[2967.61s -> 2984.46s]  just enough beard. I think. What else we got? I don't like this character. I think this is
[2984.46s -> 2992.87s]  perfect. Wait hold on. Details? All right so we can do the reverse youtuber if you want.
[3004.46s -> 3011.21s]  No no no no. Look if you can't dye your hair when you're 75 years old you can dye your
[3011.21s -> 3036.97s]  beard. Okay I think we're good. Makeup. Okay I can't really see anything. Adjustment.
[3041.18s -> 3049.29s]  Give him a cool scar. No he didn't. That implies that I was injured ever in a fight. Okay we got
[3051.02s -> 3061.32s]  Garthord. Jean Garthord or Jean. Male. Type 10. This is perfect. This is going to be the best
[3061.32s -> 3068.34s]  wizard you've ever seen. No scars means you didn't fight at all. No no scars means that I
[3068.34s -> 3076.30s]  have never been hit. I'm unhittable. You take a gigantic swing. You you pull back with
[3076.30s -> 3079.58s]  all of your might and you swing straight down and nope you're not going to hit me.
[3079.58s -> 3098.68s]  I've never been hit by a blade or an arrow or a magical spell. Pretty good. I'm ready.
[3101.46s -> 3112.66s]  I'm ready to play. Yes I'm ready to play. Make him fat. No no we can't. That's the
[3112.66s -> 3118.50s]  trope we can't go down on this channel. If there was like a germa trope it would be
[3118.50s -> 3124.89s]  character has to be very fat, very small, and very old. We have to at least try a different
[3124.89s -> 3135.29s]  character for once. No like old fat guy. I'm okay with old small guy. We can't do the three
[3135.29s -> 3147.38s]  strikes. Three strikes. Make him two. He's two. He's way too small. Is he? Then how small did
[3147.38s -> 3161.13s]  I make him? No I had him like today like every day. Waves gently lapped at the bike.
[3161.13s -> 3176.71s]  Didn't even let me read it. This is me. I can't wait till they do the camera pan. Yep.
[3177.51s -> 3191.02s]  Oh what a beautiful day in my village. Look at that pool over there. Nice resort that we're at.
[3191.02s -> 3196.71s]  I can't wait to take my shirt off and go swimming. But what I do is a dad on vacation
[3197.35s -> 3203.40s]  and smoke a bunch of cigarettes too even though I don't even smoke cigarettes.
[3220.30s -> 3234.62s]  I love the voice. You guys said I was small. I'm not even small. Look at all these people
[3234.62s -> 3262.52s]  around me. I am as tall as almost everybody here. See? I towered over that guy. I want you to pause
[3262.52s -> 3266.04s]  that and I want you to look at put a ruler up on your screen and see how tall I am.
[3267.00s -> 3280.65s]  Again untouchable. He was aiming for me. Who's that uh Marvel character that has so much luck
[3280.65s -> 3294.02s]  that you can never they can't even get hurt? Lucky. What is it? Domino. Yeah that's my
[3294.02s -> 3322.30s]  superpower. Unable to get hurt. Here we go. Where is he? Where is the human?
[3328.98s -> 3358.44s]  Unhittable. I can do whatever I want. Nobody fucking hits. Carport. Almost hit. Nope. He almost
[3358.44s -> 3374.06s]  hit me. God damn it. My first scar. Got me right in the shoulder. What the heck.
[3374.62s -> 3398.28s]  Does he know? He knows. I'm gonna get a whole lot more of these scars.
[3418.12s -> 3421.72s]  I don't know what you're saying. I'm sorry. I've got I don't know if this is what your
[3421.72s -> 3425.88s]  ancient prophecy is.
[3449.19s -> 3476.23s]  No don't eat it. Oh no. So I get it.
[3477.11s -> 3481.27s]  The dragon ate my heart. I have to get my heart back from the dragon.
[3481.83s -> 3500.07s]  So I need a band of adventurers and a band of merry merry merry. I get it. Pretty good Kingdom
[3500.07s -> 3526.09s]  Hearts opening theme song. Where the fuck is Goofy? Is Donald gonna show up? Scar.
[3528.95s -> 3543.58s]  God damn it. That's a big one. Take up arms. Fight. Fight.
[3548.06s -> 3562.25s]  You're in the chef's house. It's time for you to begin your journey as Artisan.
[3563.05s -> 3566.89s]  Arisen. But before you can win your heart back from the dragon you'll need to prepare.
[3573.90s -> 3578.15s]  Take a weapon. Oh this is where I'm gonna choose my Mickey Mouse path.
[3579.90s -> 3590.92s]  Do you like friends? Are you strong? Are you smart? Here we go. Your vocation determines
[3590.92s -> 3603.05s]  your basic attributes, wieldable equipment, and skills. Fighter. Strider. Mage. Primary weapon.
[3603.05s -> 3611.50s]  He's gonna be a two-handed wielding double-bladed axe. All right. Basic vocation to conjure of
[3611.50s -> 3618.76s]  magics to heal wounds and target elemental weaknesses. Looses a ball of fire that explodes
[3618.76s -> 3623.40s]  upon contact. Invokes a magical sigil which recovers the health of those who enter.
[3624.04s -> 3636.36s]  This is Doomage. Take on mage as a vocation. Well that's the character I made.
[3637.16s -> 3644.57s]  You can equip yourself with a primary and secondary weapon. Primary weapons such as
[3644.57s -> 3648.65s]  swords and daggers are combat essentials. Secondary weapons like bows and shields offer
[3648.65s -> 3661.10s]  support. Did I just air zooka? Oh wow. Okay I'm so happy I got the air zooka.
[3673.66s -> 3679.56s]  How do I what do I do? How long does it take to cast?
[3681.72s -> 3689.00s]  Oh okay that okay that's how long it takes to cast.
[3689.80s -> 3700.02s]  You can hold it and then you can target it. I get it. Okay oh you bet you target an area
[3700.02s -> 3709.93s]  and you just stand at it. I get it. Okay so air zooka. Fireball. You just release to shoot.
[3710.01s -> 3712.66s]  Okay let's go.
[3720.20s -> 3722.60s]  They're already talking about it. Fuck.
[3725.88s -> 3728.76s]  The one thing that he was good at, the one thing that he told everybody.
[3730.17s -> 3732.17s]  Not anymore. He's a loser now.
[3743.16s -> 3745.96s]  The only reason why we thought he was cool was because he was never hit.
[3746.76s -> 3751.48s]  He didn't even have any powers. We can't sell that. The tourism will drop.
[3752.36s -> 3778.74s]  Give me some dialogue. Quest successful. Defeating foes and completing quests earns
[3778.74s -> 3783.30s]  you experience and each level gained raises all of your attributes. Press start to bring
[3783.30s -> 3787.14s]  up the pause menu where you can check your attributes, a full map, quest information, and
[3787.14s -> 3811.46s]  more. Oh my god. Well hopefully that didn't mess anything up later. Kneecaptor. Look at
[3811.46s -> 3821.67s]  all these berries and apples and oranges. Let's sheet this so I don't get any more trouble.
[3821.67s -> 3836.71s]  Is it broom? Can I pick up the broom? Come on. What the hell is this even for? Okay what can
[3836.71s -> 3848.58s]  I do with a broom? Why did I pick up a broom? This is probably heals. Who made this Capcom?
[3848.58s -> 3851.38s]  Okay so those are those are those are resident evil herbs. They have to be.
[3851.94s -> 3871.26s]  All right let's go. Cassardist. Progress through the game by completing quests.
[3872.30s -> 3876.06s]  Always talk with the people you meet. They'll surely... people who bear an icon above their
[3876.06s -> 3881.91s]  head possess special information. Those bearing green icons have new quests to offer.
[3883.03s -> 3893.05s]  Look at this beautiful world. Beautiful game. This is why they put this here. You come
[3893.05s -> 3931.56s]  down you see the fantastic landscape. This is awful. Worse than I feared. Present. My thanks.
[3937.59s -> 3962.54s]  This is awful. You can't pick people up. He didn't like the pie. Well it was a free pie.
[3962.54s -> 3968.76s]  Well you can't get mad at a free pie. Would you get mad if somebody gave you a free pie
[3968.76s -> 3973.64s]  no matter what the quality was? It could be absolute awful quality, but if it was free
[3974.44s -> 3980.25s]  then who cares? There's talk of monsters emerging from the shadows all along the shore.
[3980.25s -> 3988.58s]  Nasty things too. The brine they call. They say there are many and yet one. Seems this brine
[3988.58s -> 3994.04s]  can be bested what's more. Not to do but avoid the water's edge. What does somebody
[3994.04s -> 4002.87s]  give you a pile of shit? Performing actions that people dislike will decrease their
[4002.87s -> 4008.31s]  affinity for you. This is the guy that wanted the pie, huh? This was the pie tutorial.
[4009.19s -> 4015.38s]  All right, look at the height difference here. This guy's like 6'4". This is not that small,
[4016.82s -> 4024.65s]  right? This is like, that's not that small. If this guy's like 6'1", this was, this is like
[4024.65s -> 4034.66s]  6 feet versus 5'11". I don't know what it is to some of you guys in this chat. Anything
[4034.66s -> 4042.30s]  under like 6'5", is tiny apparently to a lot of people here. If you're not over like 6'2",
[4042.30s -> 4048.95s]  apparently you're like a puny tiny person. Where do you guys live?
[4062.86s -> 4068.20s]  America. Purchasing equipment and useful items from shops or wandering merchants you encounter
[4068.20s -> 4073.82s]  on your travels. You can do that. Didn't somebody say I had too much money? Let's burn it.
[4077.59s -> 4080.95s]  You can restore health and stamina and advance the passage of time at any inn or
[4080.95s -> 4083.51s]  resting place. This game looks, I feel like this game is going to be a lot of fun.
[4086.92s -> 4093.08s]  I'm sorry. Wait, come here! Come here! Oh, that was a full baseball swing in the face.
[4093.08s -> 4102.22s]  Can I use this inn ever again? It's a false swing. That would kill someone.
[4103.40s -> 4109.88s]  Is this stealing? Some items can be combined with others to produce surprising results.
[4109.88s -> 4118.44s]  Experiment and see what you can come up with. A game where you can steal and there's no
[4118.44s -> 4141.32s]  consequences. I already like it. I don't know why I'm burning this guy's bed. There's no reason
[4141.32s -> 4153.24s]  for it. Tiny pillow. All right. I will agree with you. That pillow is very small. Okay.
[4154.52s -> 4160.54s]  Do the math though. This is a standard bed. If I were to lie down in this bed right now.
[4160.54s -> 4163.58s]  So let me line it up so my head would die. My head's not going to touch it.
[4165.11s -> 4171.16s]  Okay. My head would touch that pillow right here. Maybe like right here. If I lie down
[4171.16s -> 4183.30s]  straight. This bed is huge. Look at how big this bed is. Nothing to do with how tall the
[4183.30s -> 4194.89s]  character is. Rock. Well, they have resident evil crates too. It's an inn. All right.
[4194.89s -> 4198.25s]  There's a stone over here. Isn't that one of those wishing stones where I can wish
[4198.25s -> 4214.28s]  for a friend? Wish for like an ally? Empty flask. Okay. Let's put this away.
[4214.84s -> 4224.95s]  I just kind of like looking around. Your character is five two. The character's not
[4225.03s -> 4235.18s]  five two. It's five like eight. Barn. Where's this uh wish? There it is. Examine.
[4236.06s -> 4243.69s]  There ought there. There's ought there. As wrought there. Was that like a very strong
[4243.69s -> 4270.66s]  English accent? There is the first combat mission. What? Am I supposed to know who this is?
[4274.26s -> 4285.26s]  He's got a scar too. Wait a minute. We were both scarless at one point? That's not him.
[4286.22s -> 4293.80s]  He's of the pawn legion. They come from some unknown place. Just appear without a warning.
[4293.80s -> 4303.34s]  They're a strange lot. Not human. Quite. They look the part sure enough but they lack the will.
[4303.34s -> 4310.87s]  The spark what drives us. They have no capacity to feel nor act alone. So they live as
[4310.87s -> 4317.72s]  sellswords. That's gonna be the middle name of my first child.
[4320.55s -> 4326.74s]  Brandon sellsword elbertson. So you know I'm a fan of game of thrones, you know?
[4342.18s -> 4346.34s]  Second germa sellsword elbertson. I already hate your kid.
[4349.66s -> 4355.03s]  Why don't you take him? Might be you learn out of why he came to you in the first place.
[4359.10s -> 4362.54s]  Available quest change as you progress through the game. Additionally you can always consult
[4362.54s -> 4367.50s]  the quests section of the pause menu for your current objectives. People with red
[4367.50s -> 4372.38s]  icons appearing over their head have information relevant to your priority quest. If you have
[4372.38s -> 4376.54s]  several quests ongoing at the same time you can set one as priority in the quest section
[4376.54s -> 4379.18s]  of the pause menu. What's going on with the throat today? I don't know.
[4383.37s -> 4386.89s]  Doing so will make all people, places, and things relevant to the priority quest appear
[4386.89s -> 4391.78s]  prominently on your minimap. That's good. Pawns in your party will also offer advice
[4391.78s -> 4400.54s]  for the priority quest more often than for other quests in your log. Okay. To truly know
[4400.54s -> 4404.86s]  what arisen are meant to do it is likely best to follow the pawns lead. But you've
[4404.86s -> 4409.02s]  got information for me. That pawn will be looking to head west with the attempt.
[4409.10s -> 4414.86s]  Why don't you see? Oh fuck. He'll not make the trip his kindle rot where they stand.
[4414.86s -> 4420.95s]  Okay he's following me. Why not see that pawn to the encampment?
[4420.95s -> 4430.02s]  Might be you'll find art there as well. I thanks. You have a knife. All right this
[4430.02s -> 4434.50s]  guy didn't even introduce himself. Purchasing equipment here in Cassadis will make for a
[4434.50s -> 4455.69s]  safer trip to the encampment. Sell or is it where's the what do you buy? You look well.
[4455.69s -> 4467.02s]  Is there like a general store? Wait hold on. Hold on. Can I put him in the well?
[4471.00s -> 4482.71s]  This is not possible right? Oh it's boarded up. God damn it. Why do they give you this kind
[4482.71s -> 4507.19s]  of power? He's slapping your butt. Why am I doing this? There's no point in what I'm doing.
[4507.83s -> 4509.05s]  This is not gonna even do anything.
[4529.08s -> 4545.48s]  He comes back right? That guy comes back. He doesn't respawn. There's no oh you're
[4546.44s -> 4572.31s]  companion respawn. Actually gone forever. The game has permadeath so that guy actually is gone
[4572.31s -> 4592.98s]  forever. Fuck him. I don't need him. Oh my god. Can I just get a new one? Is this the
[4592.98s -> 4611.03s]  purchased a guy vending machine? Come on. I need another person. Well I'm gonna listen
[4611.03s -> 4620.30s]  to his advice and I'm gonna buy some supplies. Who gives a shit about that guy? That guy
[4620.30s -> 4631.29s]  wasn't gonna do anything anyways. This this game's fucking cool. Why did it take me so
[4631.29s -> 4640.07s]  long to play this game? This game is fucking interesting. Wait lantern. No get the lantern
[4640.07s -> 4657.18s]  not the empty flask. What am I even picking up? You already have one. Is it this is not a
[4657.18s -> 4668.78s]  lethal fall right? Is it? I'm just I don't know. I'm just gonna climb. No that's not
[4668.78s -> 4674.42s]  lethal though. All right let's take a look at the map. After accepting a quest first
[4674.42s -> 4678.02s]  note the quest marker in your map then continue by searching for the quest. That guy's actually
[4678.02s -> 4682.34s]  gone. Is this like a joke that people are doing by the way? Or is this he's actually
[4682.34s -> 4693.21s]  gone forever. There's permanent death. Quest markers will be buried. If you've
[4693.21s -> 4697.64s]  got one and want to progress through another you may find a solution in your initial
[4697.64s -> 4705.80s]  problem. Okay so where's the where's the shop? Pablo's Inn, Riftstone. What about this is?
[4706.76s -> 4728.81s]  Barn. Is it the inn? Did I permadeath that guy too? All right now that I know that there's
[4728.81s -> 4742.46s]  okay grocery store. Thanks for the groceries. There's nobody here. Steal from register
[4742.46s -> 4753.78s]  wherever the register is. Okay I got it. Okay I'm just taking all this guy's money.
[4756.07s -> 4773.78s]  Let's fuck the whole place up. You know what I mean? Never mind. Is he he sleeps oh
[4773.78s -> 4781.22s]  fisherman's house. What did I just did I just put a fairy in there?
[4781.22s -> 4803.86s]  Well this is not Legend of Zelda. Flask of oil. Okay I'm telling you guys I'm feeling it. I'm
[4803.86s -> 4813.29s]  feeling the bug from this game. Yeah sometimes you can just tell. I can just tell. I like this
[4813.29s -> 4817.13s]  game a lot and I haven't even played it for like five minutes. Actually I played for what?
[4817.13s -> 4823.05s]  How long has it been? An hour and 20 minutes? No it has not been an hour and 21 minutes.
[4823.05s -> 4826.87s]  That's how you can tell that I think the game is fun. I thought it's been I thought it
[4826.87s -> 4834.34s]  was like seven minutes ago is when I turned the stream on. Why not see that pawn to the encampment?
[4834.34s -> 4842.82s]  He's dead. Can you come with me instead? I need a like a shot. Here we go. Oh hello. Hello. It's
[4842.82s -> 4849.78s]  a mercy so much to the village was spared. I only wish I had more to offer. Okay curatives,
[4850.34s -> 4857.58s]  tools. How much is this stuff? It's overwhelming. Okay do I need an axe?
[4861.88s -> 4864.92s]  No I'm not gonna baseball swing her in the face with my fucking walking stick.
[4865.56s -> 4880.84s]  What do we got for armor? Leather cap traveler's hood. Well how much is it? What is it? What does
[4880.84s -> 4887.18s]  this do? What does this do for a feathered leather cap thick enough to protect the head
[4887.18s -> 4899.83s]  from mishaps? Location, magic, defense, defense. What does it even look like? Oh it's on there
[4899.83s -> 4903.91s]  now. Okay I thought that was my hair. This thing is so stupid. This is made out of like
[4903.91s -> 4917.46s]  newspaper. Wait do I add it to cart like it's amazon? I do. Why don't more games do that?
[4917.46s -> 4922.89s]  How long when did this fucking game come up? The add this item to cart and then check your
[4922.89s -> 4934.47s]  cart out. You gotta be kidding me. Why do is this not in other games? All right let's see
[4934.47s -> 4943.90s]  traveler's shirt. Let's take a look at the defense hemp shirt. Defense four, defense five.
[4943.90s -> 4949.72s]  This one's not bad. This one's expensive though. I don't have enough money. Maybe just
[4949.72s -> 4954.89s]  get a shirt and a hat. I think that's what I'm gonna do. Let's take a look at the
[4954.89s -> 4961.94s]  checkout. Cap and hat. I got plenty of money. Okay keep that in the checkout. Wait tunic.
[4962.58s -> 4982.07s]  No that's fine. Gloves. Got defense 70, 88. Funny bone guards. Minus one percent striking

[4996.42s -> 5003.30s]  because I'm gonna need to make sure I can 68 to 69. 70, 85. These are fine traveler's tights.
[5004.42s -> 5011.00s]  And then a cloak. Too expensive. Jewelry. Too expensive. Okay what about uh no no no no no
[5011.00s -> 5018.10s]  don't cancel the transaction. Weapons. Wooden staff. What do I have on right now?
[5020.54s -> 5028.33s]  This thing is way better than what I have right now. I have like a piece of shit on.
[5031.50s -> 5037.45s]  This is look at how much better this is. 132 magic? Yeah it's only a thousand bucks.
[5038.52s -> 5043.35s]  Add it to the cart. This is gonna turn out like every single amazon order I've ever had.

[5049.38s -> 5058.74s]  145 dollars in it. Okay tools. Tool employed to mine or just get one.

[5066.92s -> 5074.26s]  Blask of water. Yeah you gotta take water with you on a trip. Poison arrow. Oil arrow.
[5075.06s -> 5081.42s]  Dragon spit. Okay all right all right all right that um that's it. No it's not hold on what are
[5081.42s -> 5089.88s]  these? Consume it to recover a bit of health. I have seven of them. Let's get to buy three more.

[5152.54s -> 5163.35s]  So let's sell. I just didn't I what about a rock? Well you can throw the rocks never mind.
[5163.99s -> 5173.19s]  Didn't I steal a bunch of shit from somebody's house? Yeah just I don't just take that.
[5175.56s -> 5181.74s]  Herb bucket. Yeah see look. I want this stuff. I just took it to sell it.
[5182.38s -> 5192.31s]  Rusted staff. Get rid of it. I wonder if this this is shit matter. This doesn't like improve
[5192.31s -> 5203.24s]  your fishing by like five percent right? You know some games have that kind of shit. You have
[5203.24s -> 5209.16s]  to wear this. Wear the full set of fisherman's outfit. Your lore is better. All right let's go.
[5211.21s -> 5228.20s]  Uh yep. Didn't I have something else too? Item storage. Whose is this? Item storage.
[5228.20s -> 5252.06s]  This is my stuff? How is this my stuff? Why is it $2,600 to take my stuff out of storage?
[5253.10s -> 5274.28s]  Wait wait wait. This is selling. 312,000 gold. Wait why is this like this? Why does this stuff
[5274.28s -> 5289.54s]  exist? This is the DLC stuff. That's kind of unfair. I could get myself like more than a
[5289.54s -> 5304.04s]  quarter of a million dollars right now. More than that. Well how do I pull it out? Bye.
[5304.76s -> 5324.23s]  This shit ain't even in here. What the fuck is all this stuff? I need to go to the end to get
[5324.23s -> 5331.58s]  it out. No I don't want to do that. That's cheating. I'm just gonna pretend those don't
[5331.58s -> 5340.82s]  exist. I'm ready to go on my adventure, but I need to go to my equipment. All right how do I?
[5347.70s -> 5358.73s]  Is there like a certain way I can make it? I can heal. Can I touch the stone?
[5363.40s -> 5370.42s]  No. It's gotta go. I'm going and I'm gonna be ready and I'm gonna fucking attack herbs and
[5370.42s -> 5382.14s]  spells. Assign items to buttons. Where do I do that? Status? Map? Options? Status? Skills.
[5382.86s -> 5401.61s]  Okay here we go. Hold on. So I have to heal. Condition. Oh okay here we go. So this is a common
[5401.61s -> 5411.40s]  herb used in preparing and consuming. Okay it's uh sort or how do I put this? Use combine.
[5413.77s -> 5421.51s]  I can't combine with it. How do I hotkey it? Is there a way I can make this on the hotkey?
[5422.31s -> 5431.78s]  Because I just have use. You can't set shortcuts for items. Okay. You can only hotkey
[5431.78s -> 5455.22s]  it on the keyboard. Finally you set up permanently dead huh? Oh permanently dead. He's back.
[5456.78s -> 5475.90s]  Game saves automatically. You can also save manually. Uh all right I will heal you. Come
[5475.90s -> 5492.76s]  here. I just tried to heal you. Will you let me do this please? Right there. All right just
[5492.76s -> 5503.18s]  hang out in there for a second. This is a very slow heal. Throw them off the cliff.
[5508.81s -> 5514.58s]  I'm not gonna throw this guy off the cliff. Uh oh goblins.
[5521.40s -> 5527.67s]  Save the peddler. Attack while holding. You have weapon skills. You can dash. Yes I know how to
[5527.67s -> 5539.10s]  dash. You gotta pawn because this is the right knowledge and skills. They're able to assist
[5539.10s -> 5551.94s]  in tandem attacks. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Oh wait a minute. Hold on.
[5551.94s -> 5567.40s]  Why am I? Why are my things on fire? My air is on fire. We have triumphed. When foes seem to be
[5567.40s -> 5571.88s]  too much to handle try gaining levels or obtaining better equipment. Can this guy gonna
[5571.88s -> 5577.74s]  give us money? That was far through. I'm called Reynard. A traveling salesman. Though
[5577.74s -> 5583.42s]  those damnable beasts ruined my wares. Oh I'm sorry for that. But thanks to you it was only
[5583.42s -> 5595.67s]  wares I lost. He just like you just gnomed that guy and he ran away. I can't even attack that
[5595.67s -> 5603.13s]  guy now. They often come across rare items not found at stationary shops. If you see a peddler
[5603.13s -> 5612.38s]  make sure to check what they have to offer. Um well I can't do that anymore. Thanks. Thanks
[5612.38s -> 5629.70s]  guy. Gob. Gob. All right let's check this place out. Empty flask.
[5635.45s -> 5639.93s]  All right so we can go. What about down here? No yeah that's it. That's just fall off.
[5640.81s -> 5648.98s]  Right. Are we gonna fall off if we go down here? What was that? This stretch of road is
[5648.98s -> 5653.06s]  called the Menomia trail. No give me that. Why are you picking the rocks up? This looks
[5653.06s -> 5663.58s]  interesting. Stop. That's my stuff. A wealth of useful items can be found by vanquishing monsters.
[5665.34s -> 5672.57s]  Get the fuck out of here. That's mine. Just fighting over fucking mines again in veins
[5672.57s -> 5684.26s]  like in Warcraft. What's this? You can use materials. Let's just keep going. Time for
[5684.26s -> 5688.90s]  them to throw them off the cliff. No I'm not gonna throw them off the cliff. He's too useful
[5688.90s -> 5706.36s]  for me right now. Not yet. Search the log. Cedar branch.
[5710.12s -> 5724.94s]  Small nut. Did you just skin the tree? I guess I could just sprint. I want to change that to
[5724.94s -> 5730.44s]  something else. A different button. What could I make that? I'm not sure I can make it anything.
[5730.44s -> 5738.86s]  I don't like pushing left stick in. What are you? Why did you do that?
[5739.66s -> 5746.63s]  What the fuck did you do that for? What is he doing? What the fuck is wrong with you?
[5747.43s -> 5762.90s]  This is definitely, this is like a player right? No I'm not gonna throw them up. What are you
[5762.90s -> 5776.92s]  doing? We both keep having the same idea. Chests are full of articles and treasures of great value.
[5777.88s -> 5787.82s]  Yeah the Vandal brothers. Silencer arrows. Cool. Many a life was ended by falling from two
[5787.82s -> 5796.68s]  greater heights. We gotta convince them to let us in. All right we got front door. We got back
[5796.68s -> 5813.48s]  door. Are we allowed in here? If memory serves. What the hell? All right so somebody's speaking
[5813.48s -> 5823.48s]  out of the Riftstone. Follow me. That was the Wendy's girl.
[5834.07s -> 5844.02s]  That was a good one. Have all you need. We are in first and foremost but we offer more than
[5844.02s -> 5850.02s]  simple logic. We can safeguard your belongings and your big any you like. So they can learn,
[5850.02s -> 5857.14s]  this is where you can learn new skills. Rest for 300 gold. What will it be today? Learn skills.
[5859.80s -> 5869.22s]  All right I need 200 discipline. Fire boon. Thunder boon. I think I want to be electricity.
[5869.22s -> 5879.74s]  What was Gandalf? Nothing. I don't think, did Gandalf ever do a spell? He did like a light,
[5879.74s -> 5885.00s]  big thing of bright lights for like one second. He didn't have any ice moves.
[5885.00s -> 5893.99s]  Didn't have any fucking fireballs. Wasn't even a good wizard. Yeah he did the you shall not
[5893.99s -> 5904.84s]  pass. It makes like a big bright light. He was a light wizard. Well I can't do anything.
[5908.20s -> 5916.58s]  He made fireworks. All right let's get it.
[5920.98s -> 5929.16s]  There's the funny joke where Jerma says dumb things about things he doesn't know.
[5930.49s -> 5939.90s]  Well I'm like dead serious. What did Gandalf have for spells? He did like bright lights and
[5939.90s -> 5952.90s]  like a kind of crash through sides right. He did do fire at one point.
[5953.46s -> 5957.75s]  He could do like a big push yeah like a wind right.
[5964.65s -> 5972.60s]  What does Goku did besides bright lights? That's a good point.
[5982.50s -> 5983.94s]  Is that gonna make another character?
[5986.10s -> 5992.95s]  It was a theory that he only used as much magic as level two wizard in dungeons and dragons.
[6014.92s -> 6020.36s]  Well a tireless spirit of self-improvement grants the strength to lead the legion.
[6023.61s -> 6027.37s]  Gandalf was much more powerful than he let on. His job was to guide the people of middle
[6027.37s -> 6047.29s]  earth and not do everything for them. You uncultured swine. All right search the area.
[6050.60s -> 6053.32s]  My kind grows better able to serve the more we learn.
[6056.31s -> 6061.98s]  So what did one of these. Sorry I was having a Lord of the Rings argument in chat. What was
[6061.98s -> 6068.78s]  it? Alas you have yet to prove that if you would prove yourself the arisen show no fear.
[6068.78s -> 6076.70s]  Okay so I mean call the arisen. Check the area around the encampment until you find a
[6076.70s -> 6085.37s]  threat that so I just have to fight a monster. Okay a rift stone. Strange power emanates from
[6085.37s -> 6102.02s]  within. Is he gonna follow me? The beast comes. Hurry. When foes are too much to handle.
[6102.90s -> 6118.14s]  Oh they're not gonna be too much to handle. So he was a light fire wizard.
[6119.10s -> 6125.72s]  Yeah that's what I was partially correct. Like he has like light and like force like waves and
[6126.60s -> 6128.92s]  I was correct. He does have fire.
[6135.40s -> 6140.66s]  This is actually this thing's pretty huge. All right get in there.
[6144.95s -> 6152.90s]  Shit. Climb on a larger monster. What is heavy attack like this? Okay just fire.
[6154.02s -> 6161.70s]  Okay so as you take damage the amount of health you can recover through magic in the
[6161.70s -> 6166.02s]  field also decreases indicated by a white bar with the rest of an in.
[6166.90s -> 6172.23s]  Or use a curative item to fully restore your health. Giving pawns curatives to whole will
[6172.23s -> 6178.07s]  allow them to use it at their own discretion. There's no reason for me to do that.
[6184.47s -> 6188.15s]  So if you burn them they'll just they light on fire. I gotta climb up on top. Should
[6188.15s -> 6190.79s]  I even climb up on top? Should I just stand back and just cast fireballs?
[6193.75s -> 6197.64s]  Let's get a heal over there.
[6200.76s -> 6217.29s]  All right I gotta stop. Somebody just said mage gameplay and then they said resident sleeper.
[6217.93s -> 6221.61s]  I'm a fucking Gandalf all right. So I'm gonna play Gandalf.
[6228.71s -> 6235.66s]  What? Get away from me. Why did I just leave? What the hell was that?
[6238.62s -> 6241.10s]  Um all right can I climb and do like a fire bomb in his head?
[6242.18s -> 6267.40s]  Oh I can like shoot him in the head. Oh fuck. This is a lot of moving around.
[6276.30s -> 6279.98s]  How do I hit support? All right I gotta hit him right in the other leg.
[6286.33s -> 6289.13s]  All right now enchant me. Somebody do something.
[6289.61s -> 6290.65s]  I shall strike the head.
[6294.07s -> 6294.87s]  God damn it.
[6304.73s -> 6307.05s]  He can't use his arms. Light all of his whole body on fire.
[6311.03s -> 6316.79s]  Magic users. Laughing my ass off. Look I'm just I'm gonna be just fine.
[6321.00s -> 6325.72s]  Mage gameplay. Don't worry it's gonna be fun. Right in the face. That's what you've got to do.
[6326.60s -> 6332.97s]  I gotta just mage him in the face. Just wait till I get the lightning move.
[6338.89s -> 6344.46s]  Oh shit I'm tired. What a true mage.
[6345.10s -> 6348.14s]  I'm a little sleepy right now. I'm gonna cast a fireball at him.
[6356.73s -> 6362.23s]  Mage is always terrible. It's not gonna get better. Don't tell me that.
[6364.38s -> 6366.86s]  Gandalf is like my favorite character in Lord of the Rings.
[6383.40s -> 6386.36s]  Mage gets really cool later. Yeah so we're gonna be just fine.
[6387.08s -> 6396.06s]  Nothing else. Mage at endgame becomes literal jedi god.
[6397.18s -> 6398.62s]  So see everything's gonna be just fine.
[6407.77s -> 6416.55s]  All right I've proved my worthiness. Early mage gameplay. Resident sleep mode. That's how it
[6416.55s -> 6423.37s]  always is. Remember Gandalf was level two in Lord of the Rings. He could have done so much
[6423.37s -> 6427.93s]  more but he didn't because he wanted to make sure that they they had the trial not him.
[6429.58s -> 6431.34s]  A bunch of uncultured swine.
[6432.68s -> 6436.52s]  Ekba located in the command headquarters of the encampment provides many different support
[6436.52s -> 6442.30s]  functions to adventurers. Speak with them to rest and heal your wounds. Learn and enable
[6442.30s -> 6448.71s]  useful weapon skills. Restore excess items. Okay well where's my discipline point?
[6454.71s -> 6459.11s]  275. All right I can do one. I can get another move. Let's see what they got here.
[6459.11s -> 6464.31s]  A frazzle. Concentrated field of cold around the user that deals ice damage to whatever foe it
[6464.31s -> 6474.01s]  touches. It's like a battle mage. Thunder boon. Launches a bolt of magic that enchants an ally's
[6474.01s -> 6482.14s]  weapon with thunder so I can enchant his weapon and my own right. Levin. Smites the enemy from
[6482.14s -> 6485.50s]  above with tongues of lightning especially effective at driving foes out of hiding.
[6486.54s -> 6492.82s]  Okay it does do my weapon. I kind of think that's cool
[6493.62s -> 6500.97s]  so I can shoot lightning bolts. This does sound really cool too.
[6504.74s -> 6508.74s]  Yeah I'll try this. Tongues of lightning from above.
[6511.54s -> 6524.34s]  Mage is a good base for a magic archer. That sounds pretty fun. Levin. Okay I have to change
[6524.34s -> 6535.30s]  my skills. I don't have any augments. No so I can do that's fireball. We'll just do
[6537.42s -> 6543.77s]  Levin up here on primary. I can do it's like switching that's like freaking me out here.
[6544.49s -> 6547.51s]  Stop doing that. All right Levin is gonna be Y.
[6549.53s -> 6553.29s]  What will it be today? Now I'm gonna test it on this guy's skull and see what happens.
[6554.01s -> 6557.72s]  Have your pick idiot. Come again soon. Let's see.
[6559.45s -> 6565.86s]  Levin. I'm just kidding I'm not gonna do that. This game looks fucking awesome.
[6567.38s -> 6572.52s]  Yeah I mean early game this seems just like there's a lot to do a lot going on.
[6573.08s -> 6574.52s]  I'm very interested. It's very fun.
[6582.95s -> 6591.99s]  This is going to the switch? No it's not. It is?
[6600.38s -> 6603.34s]  The stream's over. I want to play this in bed on the switch.
[6603.34s -> 6604.94s]  So thanks for watching everybody. Just kidding.
[6605.02s -> 6609.74s]  They tell some you and you to share your heart.
[6613.51s -> 6620.39s]  So this is I'm gonna make another character. Oh god set the look of your constant companion
[6620.39s -> 6634.68s]  throughout your journey has arisen your main pawn. This is important. This is kenshi. Another
[6634.68s -> 6640.94s]  hour incoming. No no no no no. We're gonna get this done very quickly. Okay uh another
[6640.94s -> 6649.51s]  wizard. Well I'm doing Star Wars A Link to the Past every single I'm gonna have four wizards
[6649.51s -> 6654.57s]  and we're each gonna be a different element like in that Zelda game. I'm gonna have fire wizard.
[6654.57s -> 6657.61s]  I'm gonna have lightning wizard. I'm gonna have ice wizard. I'm gonna have fucking uh
[6659.74s -> 6674.57s]  jester like joke wizard. Not a wizard. I can't do like all red robe, blue robe, green robe,
[6674.57s -> 6684.55s]  white robe. That would be so interesting. Oh we only get to we only get one. Oh shit one of
[6684.55s -> 6692.46s]  this has to be a huge guy. I gotta make a huge tank. You can do that but it would be awful.
[6702.71s -> 6707.43s]  Be smart about this. Oh but I want I want to do like the four links.
[6716.28s -> 6719.64s]  You can do it but that only if you're stupid and I hate you. Come on.
[6727.10s -> 6741.85s]  All right okay here we go. I don't know what the hell that name was
[6741.85s -> 6791.46s]  that's why I instantly deleted it. Bob shell. Uh you do jacks. Jinx. Can't make Ronald McDonald.
[6802.57s -> 6809.37s]  Mickey D. Oh I hate making characters because I sit here for too long.
[6811.58s -> 6832.44s]  Shito? I can't make Shito. Shito would have to be a bard for Shito. Is there like song?
[6833.40s -> 6870.86s]  Sean. Seth. Sharp. Shelly. Shito. Come on. She. Sean. Smudge. No. Sora. God. I'm gonna turn my mouse
[6870.86s -> 6876.15s]  upside down because I think it's it's pulling from yeah I have my mouse has to be upside down.
[6876.71s -> 6883.38s]  It's gonna be like a musical instrument or something. Siren. That's a musical instrument.
[6885.02s -> 6892.20s]  Sprinkles. That's fine. All right this is important.
[6909.24s -> 6922.49s]  Tiny. Very tiny. Yeah but it needs to be skinny. No no no no no no no go back.
[6922.49s -> 6927.13s]  Go back go back go back go back back back back back. That's not correct.
[6942.02s -> 6949.38s]  Yeah I mean it really could be any of them. Fine I'll do the joke one. Build. All right I
[6949.38s -> 6970.73s]  can do okay now I can do actual editing. Okay detailed edits. Uh let's get body is
[6970.73s -> 6987.99s]  most important to happen first. I need small but stretched. Stature. All right height.
[6988.87s -> 7018.01s]  Can I do like a custom color? Make it taller? You're gonna make a stick bug.
[7018.73s -> 7040.01s]  Can I have like a mask on or something? I don't know if there's an option to do
[7040.81s -> 7068.41s]  um here. Skinny. Bulky. No. Tiny. That doesn't look right. That's the same person I just
[7068.41s -> 7084.47s]  made. No it's gonna be long and skinny. Little tiny arms. Legs long and skinny.
[7088.57s -> 7103.30s]  Stance. Straight up. Not just like that. Make Kylo Ren. I'm not gonna make Kylo Ren.
[7104.10s -> 7122.22s]  Okay facial here. Let's get this off. I'm just clean shaving. This does I know this doesn't look
[7122.22s -> 7131.18s]  anything. Just wait we gotta give it a second. Hold on. This doesn't.
[7134.66s -> 7137.62s]  Okay hold on. Faces.
[7145.18s -> 7158.09s]  I can't do that. It's gotta be this one. Completely bald.
[7159.42s -> 7169.43s]  Face shape. Gotta have a big wide mouth and just a circle for a head. That's not bad.
[7170.07s -> 7185.86s]  That one's not bad. I can make it. That one's okay. Yeah this one. This is like a nice
[7185.86s -> 7202.31s]  round face. Eyes have to be just the two dots. I'm gonna just do that. You're making Bobby
[7202.31s -> 7214.97s]  Hill. I'm not making Bobby Hill. I can make the eyes really small. Okay hold on. This
[7214.97s -> 7219.53s]  character is gonna be fucking terrible. I'm gonna live with this fucking character forever.
[7221.74s -> 7232.10s]  Vertical position down. Spacing. Pretty wide. Size. Small. Eye color. Black.
[7232.98s -> 7245.34s]  Okay. Face shape. Is there a way I can add the details? Okay here we go.
[7250.71s -> 7263.18s]  The head. It is a little bigger. The eyes. We're gonna get the shape. Brows. No brows.
[7263.18s -> 7278.79s]  Can I just delete them? Hold on. I think I can. You can't really see them there.
[7278.79s -> 7289.00s]  Just make them lighter. Nose. We need to try to get rid of the nose.
[7289.00s -> 7298.94s]  Is that even possible? Have to get a little one. Vertical position.
[7300.95s -> 7327.00s]  It's not possible. This is where we're gonna get. We're gonna get. It's gonna get sold here.
[7327.00s -> 7344.62s]  Ready? We need a long skinny wide mouth. This is wide as it can get. That is the
[7344.62s -> 7381.69s]  widest I can get it. No ears. This didn't work at all. What about like makeup? Can I
[7381.69s -> 7393.72s]  add anything? It just has to be. I mean this actually helps a little because
[7395.00s -> 7422.84s]  Shito's eyes are just black. No that doesn't. This is not bad. It really isn't. Because
[7422.84s -> 7432.50s]  that's the line for the mouth. That's the the darker eyes. I'm not gonna want to listen to
[7432.50s -> 7454.87s]  that. I can't believe I'm doing like the YouTuber joke. How tall is he? He's huge!
[7472.98s -> 7497.27s]  All the way tall but he's. He fits in my hand. You know tall and lanky. I mean he is very
[7497.27s -> 7506.90s]  lanky but he's very tall. He's seven feet tall. All right this is a weird universe.
[7507.54s -> 7531.45s]  Fine. Change the voice. Can I change this voice later? That's. You're talking like
[7531.45s -> 7533.85s]  four hours from now. You really gonna hear that shit anymore?
[7533.85s -> 7555.02s]  That's good. I'm not. I can't handle the baby voice the whole time.
[7562.10s -> 7562.98s]  Nobody can take that.
[7572.94s -> 7579.00s]  I like eight. Eight is just enough annoyance without being annoying.
[7580.54s -> 7592.23s]  All right I'm good. Shito. I think that's good to go.
[7597.10s -> 7601.26s]  Ooh hold on. Hold on. I gotta answer as if I am Shito. So this is important.
[7601.26s -> 7605.82s]  Your answers will shape your pawn's inclination. When faced with danger which trait would you
[7605.82s -> 7624.25s]  most value in a follower? The charisma to lead others. Charisma. Shito sings. While in battle
[7624.25s -> 7630.17s]  which strategy would you prefer your follower employ? Kill all enemies. Strike at the
[7630.17s -> 7641.51s]  strongest foe. Rescue comrades in danger. Call for reinforcements. Call. Call or rescue.
[7642.23s -> 7653.82s]  Shito would never kill anybody. Your follower rescues your party and turns the tide of the
[7653.82s -> 7663.77s]  entire battle. What would you have them say? This way master. Leave them to me. Now master.
[7663.77s -> 7679.88s]  Strike the final blow. Quickly. After them. Master strike the final blow. As a ruler which
[7679.88s -> 7683.72s]  gift would you how would you how happy would you be about one of these options?
[7684.52s -> 7693.13s]  A magic potion that preserves youth. A brave and just hero to succeed you. The perfect spouse.
[7695.05s -> 7718.87s]  A majestic white steed. It's not spouse. The perfect spouse. You see the spouse of course.
[7722.39s -> 7728.97s]  Spouse means a little bit more utility. Spouse is more guardian.
[7734.09s -> 7744.54s]  Gandalf has a white horse. This is not Gandalf though. I think I like the utility. White steed.
[7745.96s -> 7760.18s]  Vocation. Fighter. Strider. Mage. Hmm probably something that can...
[7766.46s -> 7781.50s]  one of these two. We're gonna get our asses kicked if I do Mage. Bow and arrow. I mean
[7781.50s -> 7790.33s]  the bow is shaped like his body so the bow it's a bit sad that's what his body looks like.
[7790.89s -> 7803.51s]  Don't worry the next character we get is gonna be Danny DeVito and he'll be a tank.
[7804.31s -> 7821.19s]  Her fealty is sworn to you Arisen. From this day the Legion's men called pawns live and die
[7821.19s -> 7841.51s]  by your command. Nothing about this is correct. Am I okay I was gonna say what am I supposed to
[7841.51s -> 7848.65s]  be doing here? Quest successful. Having been reorganized having been recognized as Arisen you've
[7848.65s -> 7852.65s]  been granted a loyal pawn to be your constant companion in your journey. In addition to this
[7852.65s -> 7856.41s]  main pawn you may hire up to two other pawns to support you in your adventures.
[7856.97s -> 7860.73s]  Different pawns have different strengths so you support pawns to tailor your party to
[7860.73s -> 7866.65s]  fit your current needs. In addition to minding level and available skills a pawn's knowledge
[7866.65s -> 7871.21s]  is another important part of creating an effective party. Pawns with appropriate
[7871.21s -> 7874.81s]  knowledge of quests or foes can provide helpful advice and battle strategies.
[7875.93s -> 7894.78s]  What am I doing? This is a rift a space between realms from which there any and
[7894.78s -> 7901.16s]  all manner of pawns may be found. Should one catch your eye speak with the pawn to enlist
[7901.16s -> 7911.96s]  it to your party. The god of war guy. You may hire only two pawns onto your party at one time
[7911.96s -> 7925.85s]  they can then be discharged. You may hire only two pawns onto your party at one time they can
[7925.85s -> 7931.50s]  then be discharged by speaking with them again. Hmm I wonder if I should pick poop butt.
[7933.51s -> 7949.45s]  I wonder this that's well what a great character that probably is. Level 61 what level
[7949.53s -> 7958.98s]  am i i'm level four why would i bring a level 61 all right i want to like how do i see more

[14353.06s -> 14357.94s]  interesting to all of you is because he's wearing a funny hat and that's just the dlc hat
[14358.26s -> 14367.03s]  i'll take that we'll go no further until we find the switch that opens the screen
[14367.03s -> 14376.71s]  will be easier going searching this area now okay just throw one off again i don't think

[14384.09s -> 14394.26s]  back to this one controls this door master are there like illusory walls and why would
[14394.26s -> 14402.30s]  they i don't even know why i'm asking that question throw somebody off and then try to

[17960.25s -> 17969.24s]  so now i look like a friend do people that are part of the cult
[17970.12s -> 17974.04s]  and then once they become very close friends that's when we do a backstab
[17988.20s -> 17999.78s]  first person is here lady with the pot oh i see we are kindred spirits sir throw off
[17999.78s -> 18004.26s]  building will you be at the gathering then where it is needs to be a high officiant presiding

[18068.89s -> 18074.49s]  arisen to shan salvation's creed though truth be told i'm far from a devout myself
[18075.93s -> 18089.34s]  that's all you got no other information just why is there a chipmunk sub sometimes
[18090.86s -> 18102.01s]  yeah i i mean it's very the game has a character creator and you can make them have very very high
[18102.01s -> 18106.49s]  to very very low voice that's probably very off-putting if you're just joining us
[18108.18s -> 18111.62s]  and trust me it's off-putting to me and i've been here for five hours playing it
[18112.18s -> 18118.86s]  the gatherings to take place down in the catacombs i hear he sounds upset talking about
[18118.94s -> 18123.10s]  me there just far too dangerous a place to brave for a night's diversion

[18136.52s -> 18157.21s]  characters that were given to me that's not a lie that is for real you didn't have to pick

[18252.02s -> 18267.11s]  you'll fall unconscious so why the hell did it want me to come up this way oh what it's all
[18267.11s -> 18290.15s]  the way over here it so i have to go the other way because it was an exit it will point you to

[21920.30s -> 21928.03s]  shit that's in the game but as just a video game it's it's actually very fun it's a
[21928.03s -> 21963.05s]  straight-up video game i don't think that's safe i'm on my way there's like a stone over
[21963.05s -> 21971.24s]  here should i change people
[21973.07s -> 21986.70s]  i'll take that what level are these people 15 14 oh good that's just in case you're going
[21986.70s -> 21994.25s]  to change out a party member or something all right save it let's go pay the cult a visit
[22004.96s -> 22009.76s]  easy this looks interesting do you come to offer prayers for those who put down the crystal
[22009.76s -> 22023.16s]  here very well i'll go at once what's that do i only get to place that one time i'll take that
[22023.80s -> 22037.05s]  i need a lantern it is too dark to navigate without a torch i'll well search the area
[22037.05s -> 22047.52s]  the crypt was fashioned ages before the fate came to grancest oh rats light cure
[22047.92s -> 22058.59s]  this looks interesting you need to open this gate to use the lift long ago when the people
[22058.59s -> 22066.96s]  worshiped the old gods the gods of nature we cannot pass through i suspect it's why they
[22066.96s -> 22074.27s]  return their dead to the soil to the earth god what's this that their souls might be
[22074.27s -> 22080.84s]  cleansed and born anew and they never stop talking it's very very funny they don't ever
[22080.84s -> 22088.84s]  stop speaking
[22088.84s -> 22097.64s]  go the other way go this way that's interesting this place crawls with the undead i've learned
[22097.64s -> 22102.22s]  of this area what's this yes you have
[22102.22s -> 22110.64s]  a joke voice you heard it
[22118.48s -> 22120.24s]  well fire is really good here
[22121.68s -> 22123.52s]  this looks interesting what is that
[22142.64s -> 22146.24s]  so it would be awkward if nobody talked in a party of four people
[22148.08s -> 22156.86s]  yeah it would all right strength in numbers i believe some of the coffins are booby trapped
[22158.36s -> 22164.54s]  that's good to know check closely before opening the coffins no booby trap in there
[22165.34s -> 22170.52s]  this is the person here
[22178.43s -> 22186.24s]  we all have a curse now maybe i shouldn't have jumped inside of the casket this second you
[22186.32s -> 22187.28s]  fucking opened it

[23245.42s -> 23248.65s]  i'm not sure what i must have been not paying attention i must have been focusing on
[23248.65s -> 23252.25s]  something or i might not have been here but thank you big marsh if you're still here
[23253.21s -> 23264.72s]  for a shitload of community subs thank you you guys not gonna pick all this up
[23271.23s -> 23277.71s]  you named it poop master i did not i didn't name this i know people are gonna coming to the stream
[23277.71s -> 23282.25s]  and they're thinking that i did that i swear to god i'm gonna get rid of him that character
[23282.25s -> 23285.29s]  has to get thrown in the trash because people are gonna come and think that i actually made
[23285.29s -> 23292.14s]  that character i didn't make any of these people i made it shito that's the only one
[23299.05s -> 23307.72s]  haha you named him master oh my god i know i didn't though i had to use
[23308.60s -> 23319.90s]  this looks interesting what's this had to use two years ago
[23320.54s -> 23330.91s]  it's the map this is the way to go but let me just see what's down here first probably an exit
[23332.80s -> 23347.16s]  shortcut something way back up maybe uh-huh we draw further from their meeting place
[23347.96s -> 23370.25s]  there is the shortcut perfect didn't want to make youtuber jokes but chose poop master
[23371.13s -> 23381.07s]  yeah but wasn't that more chats doing than it was mine and i've got to be fair to myself a
[23381.07s -> 23386.27s]  little bit here this pretty much like a 30 chance that the character's name is going to
[23386.27s -> 23391.29s]  be named like poo poo dickhead or something we've seen at least three or four of them
[23391.85s -> 23411.21s]  the voice from beyond the door it's the meeting
[23422.78s -> 23424.38s]  the cult meeting we're about to break it up
[23427.58s -> 23429.69s]  is this on pc it is on pc

[23478.51s -> 23479.87s]  this
[23488.76s -> 23492.52s]  don't don't don't blow cover here no stay with me very well
[23501.10s -> 23524.67s]  best we brought cures for various ailments they may save our lives
[23530.72s -> 23534.88s]  duty bound to seed our souls unto it
[23550.89s -> 23553.69s]  what i didn't do anything
[23557.40s -> 23559.80s]  no i wanted to watch that what what did i do wrong
[23560.52s -> 23563.96s]  this is the answer dear
[23572.92s -> 23576.76s]  there comes a boss he's going to sacrifice everybody in there they're going to turn to a
[23576.76s -> 23611.92s]  giant monster don't look behind you don't look behind you oh we never see the full front of
[23611.92s -> 23629.58s]  face okay defeat the undead oh really i was about to have help me poop master
[23630.86s -> 23635.93s]  the guy that i didn't make every time i say his name i have to assume maybe one or two people
[23635.93s -> 23659.15s]  came to the screen i didn't make that character we obviously haven't so keep at it
[23659.95s -> 23675.96s]  die hey i just joined the screen did he make poop master no no i suppose it's the stuff of
[23675.96s -> 23686.83s]  every day to you arisen i'd thank you to join me for a moment we have triumphed strength in
[23686.83s -> 23703.87s]  numbers arisen what's that why didn't you make poop master does that somebody didn't even
[23703.87s -> 23711.90s]  realize listen the person that made poop master didn't know that his character was
[23711.90s -> 23717.74s]  going to be able to be seen or used anywhere that was a dumb just easy shitty name to make
[23717.74s -> 23733.44s]  your character he has no idea that it's being used online how many times you guys made a
[23733.44s -> 23738.40s]  character name and it was like dog shit because you don't you know if you're playing a game
[23738.40s -> 23745.12s]  you don't have to worry about it to be sure but at least he's talkative no honor you say
[23747.76s -> 23756.57s]  it was just a lark all in good fun never gave over to that raw about destruction and salvation
[23756.57s -> 23765.32s]  never just the same it'd be trouble if we let him go free now that he's seen the two of us
[23765.32s -> 23783.24s]  together why you you promise no five two by the way right guys nope more like six one or like
[23783.24s -> 23792.97s]  five eleven i feel more familiar with this question the arisen ran counter to the tides
[23792.97s -> 23802.17s]  the heretic he said but i i see what reasonable sort the sword like to hear reason i get off
[23802.17s -> 23807.13s]  of them come sir what's to be gained from bloody in your hands your choice to make arisen
[23807.13s -> 23812.97s]  i'm on my way away from him there's not to stay the dragon's fire what say we await
[23812.97s -> 23820.81s]  tradition together there's many a pleasure to indulge in air salvation comes gladly furnish
[23820.81s -> 23825.77s]  the coin that we shall follow whatever you decide spare me arisen that i may live to see
[23825.77s -> 23833.37s]  very well you'll be well don't be a fool sir surely my gold is worth more to you than my head
[23848.64s -> 23859.88s]  empty stomach to do for an unarmed man i force push them was wrong to doubt it
[23859.88s -> 23863.96s]  that kills people glad to know you're someone i can trust in times to come
[23865.37s -> 23870.73s]  go i didn't know you could die from an erizuka
[23871.85s -> 23882.72s]  we'll bring this skull of foxes to bed you and i oh maybe i shouldn't have done that i
[23882.72s -> 23894.83s]  shouldn't have thrown a firecracker in the air sound judgment this was the only way it's okay
[23894.83s -> 23901.39s]  he was a bad guy hey thanks even had you spared doubtless mason would not have shown such
[23901.39s -> 23919.28s]  mercy cheeto is getting jaded uh-oh uh-oh i wonder what's inside you gotta let the leader open that
[23919.92s -> 23932.08s]  don't you say master looter is on all right now you fucked it all up the guild leader
[23932.64s -> 23943.58s]  loots the bodies and then we roll and then it goes out to who wins let us return to the
[23943.58s -> 23952.11s]  capital what's that what's this doing here well uh new mission is over so that means we can
[23952.11s -> 23979.10s]  sacrifice one of these guys probably poop master nice throat model top well favorite flower
[23980.54s -> 23991.88s]  many a life was ended by falling from two all right we need to go back this way
[23995.23s -> 23996.51s]  well i guess we're just to go here
[23999.07s -> 24008.92s]  here we're giving it this other one get up what happened to hamburger feet well

[24458.62s -> 24460.73s]  just two archers they're easy nothing
[24466.04s -> 24471.37s]  nice work all right let's get out of here
[24471.85s -> 24492.97s]  okay straight on the road and then take a ride he's playing a mage yeah it seems like fun
[24493.69s -> 24504.41s]  the capital is not without its dangers as we remain cautious why you're not using
[24504.41s -> 24510.01s]  auto travel be ready for anything you madman grab the eternal fairy stone from your storage
[24510.09s -> 24518.46s]  all right so what do we need to do in here we need to go this way noble quarter complete it
[24524.36s -> 24535.84s]  he doesn't know don't break his gamer immersion can't climb this i think i have to go all the
[24535.84s -> 24546.84s]  way around get a new skill or two yeah i think what we'll probably do is i'll probably get
[24546.84s -> 24564.33s]  a new skill or two yeah i think i'll probably get a new skill or two yeah i think i'll probably
[24564.73s -> 24569.72s]  get a new skill or two yeah i think what we'll probably do is i'm probably gonna call it up here
[24570.81s -> 24577.34s]  it's been just about seven hours after the bits probably about eight hours
[24586.04s -> 24593.05s]  end of the stream voice yeah there's so much shit to do
[24600.65s -> 24613.72s]  think you play more of this game i think so i think so i did the cult then the gatherings
[24613.72s -> 24619.72s]  of salvation did have sinister purpose it is a grave shame the elysian slipped our snare
[24619.72s -> 24625.00s]  we shall redouble our vigilance here to keep the city safe i fear you are as like a target
[24625.00s -> 24631.42s]  as grand soren though for now i leave you with my thanks that's a lot of experience
[24632.38s -> 24650.52s]  cool level 19 all right so here is the deal over the next few days i got a lot of shit so
[24651.32s -> 24658.40s]  there's a bunch of stuff that i'm gonna have there's dreamcast there's some playstation 2
[24658.40s -> 24665.64s]  stuff that i wanted to do there's the dark souls 3 first person mod there's so much stuff that
[24665.64s -> 24680.20s]  i want to do 170 dollars of amazon purchases but there's i have a lot of things to stream
[24680.76s -> 24687.63s]  so expect to see this game again in the next few days but we might change gears tomorrow
[24687.71s -> 24693.31s]  depending on what i have because i a lot of stuff is ordered and it's shipping
[24693.95s -> 24697.87s]  so depending on what i end up with tomorrow we might change gears a little
[24704.76s -> 24712.14s]  but definitely expect this game within the next couple of days and then of course the january
[24712.14s -> 24719.15s]  23rd stream is just going to be irl i'm not going to play a game so let me take a look
[24719.15s -> 24728.83s]  actually let me see a like a calendar why am i going to stop streaming like tonight
[24730.22s -> 24733.69s]  um just because it's probably going to be about an eight hour stream and
[24734.94s -> 24740.75s]  i can always feel my energy levels dropping and getting a little tired getting hungry
[24741.39s -> 24754.41s]  when it's less viewers than kenshi you know it's not good that's all right though that
[24754.41s -> 24769.80s]  doesn't bother me it's also like yeah it's also like very late there were a lot of
[24769.80s -> 24774.76s]  people here earlier it was like almost 4 000 people here in the first couple two or
[24774.76s -> 24781.24s]  three hours of the stream i also started late too so i started like an hour plus late so
[24781.96s -> 24790.01s]  no i don't i don't ever expect people to you know if you if you're not interested
[24790.01s -> 24795.21s]  that no that's fine there's still a lot of fucking people here more than like two
[24795.21s -> 24815.88s]  2 500 2000 that's a lot of fucking people i had a had a great time but let me look at the
[24815.88s -> 24827.68s]  calendar because so today is technically friday tomorrow i don't know i kind of can't this is
[24827.68s -> 24833.52s]  the weird kind of spot that i'm in with all the games that i have to play so a dreamcast stream
[24834.65s -> 24840.81s]  is really going to have to be that's going to be over at least a couple of streams
[24841.53s -> 24846.67s]  a game like this needs to be streamed more than once starting like dark souls 3 insane mod
[24846.67s -> 24852.33s]  night that's that's can't just do that one day right i have to think of how i want to
[24852.33s -> 24864.35s]  block this out and do this i got shen mu i have all those classic dreamcast games
[24868.19s -> 24874.67s]  i'll figure it out so expect tomorrow and i don't know maybe we'll just do this again tomorrow
[24875.48s -> 24881.47s]  maybe it's very possible but if you don't see this tomorrow then expect either the
[24881.47s -> 24890.17s]  dark souls 3 insane night or uh some dreamcast stuff or i also have lifeline for playstation
[24890.17s -> 24895.10s]  2 which is the voice activated like i don't even know what it is i know it's like a
[24895.10s -> 24909.74s]  voice activated adventure game and then the 23rd yeah we got there's a lot going on so
[24910.30s -> 24915.31s]  regardless you'll see me tomorrow we'll figure it out thanks for sticking around if you're
[24915.31s -> 24922.81s]  leaving we're gonna do the bits and the subs see ya thanks for watching see y'all tomorrow
[24922.81s -> 24929.68s]  what's the usual time to stream i you okay i think that i no thank god i just clicked
[24929.68s -> 24935.07s]  i think i just shot that guy but i didn't all right we're gonna save it i usually start
[24935.07s -> 24951.48s]  around 3 p.m pacific which is 6 p.m eastern let me just exit the game because it's kind
[24951.48s -> 24970.52s]  of i can't really alt tab out of it there we go quit the game 7 a.m for aussies i can't
[24970.52s -> 24976.49s]  that's so strange to think about that think about where that is it's a 14 hour difference
[24976.49s -> 24992.67s]  isn't it no more than that 17 hour difference that's wild but let's go through the bits
[24993.47s -> 25002.40s]  see y'all tomorrow hopefully this time starting at three not like four pacific hey jess thanks
[25002.40s -> 25011.13s]  for the one dollar give shito the autotune voice modulator and actually that's not a bad idea
[25012.41s -> 25016.09s]  i gotta set that up though i have to change what my input is and everything it's gonna take a
[25016.09s -> 25021.61s]  few minutes so we'll do that another time because uh i don't have access to that changer right
[25021.61s -> 25027.92s]  now i have i probably have to like restart some stuff but it's a good idea like you
[25027.92s -> 25034.00s]  alex for the one dollar germa when are your shirts coming out i'm dying well let me i'll
[25034.00s -> 25043.16s]  explain the t-shirt thing so while back uh ashley and i were like hey let's do another shirt
[25043.88s -> 25049.26s]  and the shirt is if you don't know it is the solar system it's a beautiful picture of the of
[25049.26s -> 25055.50s]  the actual solar system there's some really nice nuanced stuff there's a a boy and a
[25055.50s -> 25059.50s]  man and his son you know looking through a telescope at the actual night sky it's a beautiful
[25059.50s -> 25067.52s]  shirt a couple months went by and another emote was added which was a different planet
[25068.78s -> 25072.46s]  i probably should put that on too another month went by oh wait hold on
[25073.66s -> 25078.35s]  we got like two more planet emotes so eventually it got to a point where
[25078.35s -> 25087.76s]  this shirt kept on getting pushed because we just i kept adding planet emotes so
[25088.56s -> 25096.86s]  to save the space on the shirt there are a couple of planet omissions just because it all
[25096.86s -> 25104.67s]  wouldn't fit on the shirt well for instance germa saturn doesn't exist it's not there
[25104.67s -> 25108.08s]  the planet doesn't that planet's gonna get like deleted in the next germa rumble anyways
[25108.80s -> 25123.98s]  germa mercury is also not on there cluedo is on there the only ones that aren't on there
[25124.94s -> 25139.28s]  are saturn mercury and i think that's the only two that are on there jupiter is on there oh of
[25139.28s -> 25153.76s]  course it is yeah you gotta have jupiter on there but it'll be it's a nice shirt it's really
[25153.76s -> 25162.33s]  really interesting it's really fun and it is going to be on sale very soon because i
[25162.33s -> 25170.94s]  literally just talked to her again and we're gonna go from there so expect it within i would
[25171.66s -> 25178.20s]  at some point before the end of january so either the last week of january or the first
[25178.20s -> 25182.52s]  week of february is probably when it'll be on sale and the glue man shirts coming back too
[25183.40s -> 25193.52s]  so they'll both be on sale because there's really no other reason why that would be held
[25193.52s -> 25198.11s]  back at all because there the shirt is pretty much done and the glue man shirt already is
[25198.11s -> 25207.76s]  done it's the same artwork it's just going back on sale but hopefully that answers your
[25207.76s -> 25212.12s]  question thank you for the one dollar thank you bake me home for the $1 thank you divas
[25212.12s -> 25219.68s]  for the $2 thank you mr. dask for the five dollars their masterworks all you can't go wrong
[25222.72s -> 25227.44s]  oh oh the masterwords all you can't go wrong where i where have i i keep hearing
[25227.44s -> 25239.85s]  that where have i heard that before the master works all you can't go wrong master works all
[25239.85s -> 25252.99s]  you can't go wrong no wait no and i think did i forget already forget it's from the game no i
[25252.99s -> 25260.67s]  know but what is a star sub sound okay that's probably why that's definitely where i know it
[25260.67s -> 25282.64s]  from then why that has a sub sound but then again what the fuck is my sub sound mine's worse
[25282.64s -> 25289.45s]  mine's way worse i gotta change those i gotta you know i might just drop the sub sound like
[25289.53s -> 25297.42s]  sound off completely or do it something else i never know what the hell to do place it with
[25297.42s -> 25305.55s]  something else don't do that we'll see superintendent chalmers thanks for the one dollar i can't believe
[25305.55s -> 25316.76s]  they made a game about the dogma from monster hunter the dodo the dogma i played monster hunter
[25316.76s -> 25323.77s]  what what's the dogma hey c4g thanks for the dollar 25 here you go sonny use this dollar in
[25323.77s -> 25335.98s]  a shiny quarter to buy yourself a brand new dreamcast new dream caster the dreamcast was
[25335.98s -> 25343.15s]  not expensive it's all these rare dreamcast games that are like a hundred plus dollars each
[25343.87s -> 25350.68s]  i severely underestimated just how rare some of this stuff actually was
[25351.56s -> 25357.36s]  uh thank you sad vega for the one dollar hey germa i know you won't see this till after the
[25357.36s -> 25362.48s]  stream but there are some great mods for this game that improve the graphics and look at the
[25362.48s -> 25368.08s]  game without changing its mechanics unless you want to change mechanics go check out nexus mods
[25368.08s -> 25374.14s]  and don't get the blind me mod and i'll get the don't blind me mod really helpful with
[25374.14s -> 25380.54s]  lightning effects i was actually going to say that i was thinking that but i didn't say it
[25381.58s -> 25391.18s]  that every time the lightning struck it was kind of unnerving to my brain i will at least
[25391.18s -> 25400.46s]  go get that one uh and also the resident enb grandsis texture improvement there's also a handy
[25400.46s -> 25405.72s]  dandy mod pack that i think is most popular that improves most things i'll probably just
[25405.72s -> 25414.57s]  go get it especially the lightning stuff and some of the other maybe graphic updates but
[25414.57s -> 25417.69s]  i thank you i appreciate that because i the lightning thing is something i was thinking
[25417.69s -> 25423.56s]  but wasn't saying hey dan with wings thanks for the 10 dollars dan hey germa i haven't been
[25423.56s -> 25426.76s]  able to resub for the last couple of months since i wasn't working due to school
[25427.32s -> 25430.84s]  figured out give back by giving some community subs and bits from my favorite streamer
[25431.56s -> 25438.33s]  also you introduced me to celeste with which i am enjoying a lot that's not surprising celeste
[25438.33s -> 25444.92s]  was a really really really great fun challenging platformer no surprise that you're enjoying it
[25447.82s -> 25453.26s]  but thank you for your community subs and thank you for the 10 dollars no one is ever
[25453.26s -> 25459.63s]  under any obligation to pay me please keep that in mind but thank you so much regardless
[25462.70s -> 25474.32s]  online influencer i have one guy bought it how many people bought celeste after the two celeste
[25474.32s -> 25483.45s]  streams that's not a great return on investment if i was a game company what are like 11 people
[25483.45s -> 25500.46s]  buy it okay imagine if like imagine if even 100 people downloaded celeste celeste is how much
[25500.46s -> 25512.24s]  money 20 bucks so if it's 20 dollars so that would be like what 100 copies would be a
[25512.24s -> 25521.66s]  two grand right so imagine if i had been like paid i'm not saying i'm not just that i'm not
[25521.66s -> 25525.98s]  saying i was well this is the exact amount of money i would get but imagine if i was paid to
[25525.98s -> 25536.94s]  like promote that game and only like 80 people bought it well they would have made money but
[25536.94s -> 25545.16s]  would they have though because they would have had to pay me right true but at least you
[25545.16s -> 25552.89s]  still get paid but those 80 people convinced two other people to buy it so then you got
[25552.97s -> 25557.53s]  80 people telling two people then two people telling 80 and then 80 more people than all the
[25557.53s -> 25567.69s]  sudden that's that's 200 000 sales over the course of like six months how much do you charge
[25567.69s -> 25579.12s]  per stream i've never done it so i don't know i have no idea probably like 30 probably 30
[25579.12s -> 25587.29s]  bucks no no it would have to be it'd have to be like you know what it would be like
[25587.29s -> 25595.80s]  it would be a uh it'd be a thousand dollars per person watching well that would be way too
[25595.80s -> 25602.57s]  much maybe what would it be about per viewer 100 bucks per viewer because you know that's how
[25602.57s -> 25607.53s]  valuable these viewers are these aren't just some simple run-of-the-mill fucking viewers
[25607.53s -> 25614.03s]  okay i could sell you guys so hard you know i know i could talk about how you guys are some
[25614.03s -> 25618.83s]  of the most valuable viewers on twitch and it would be i'll be telling the truth but that
[25618.83s -> 25631.68s]  marketing person would hear that i'm only worth 100 bucks that's pretty cheap well 100 times
[25631.68s -> 25642.78s]  1600 is that's a lot that would mean 1600 that's oh my god that's too that's way too much money
[25643.50s -> 25656.22s]  that's 160 000 okay you know what i'll stream i will stream fallout 5 but i want 160 000
[25656.22s -> 25663.68s]  dollars and that's that 1600 people there were 35 3800 people here earlier that's almost a
[25663.68s -> 25680.38s]  half million dollars to stream it no i don't do sponsored streams so i never have and
[25680.38s -> 25693.90s]  i don't think i ever will you mean you you mean your audience is the easiest to manipulate
[25694.62s -> 25702.91s]  what fairway solitaire doesn't count because that was like on youtube like six years ago
[25702.91s -> 25706.99s]  it's the only time i've ever done it i've never done it ever since and that was i
[25706.99s -> 25712.03s]  already made a video listen to me hold on a minute let me defend myself i made a fairway
[25712.03s -> 25719.47s]  solitaire video because i liked the game a lot the company then contacted me and said hey you
[25719.47s -> 25723.63s]  want to give the game away to a bunch of people and i was like sure i think the game's fun it
[25723.63s -> 25730.16s]  was later it was after that and it was just you could just download the game for free if you
[25730.16s -> 25733.77s]  used a code i think you know if i had to pay for anything i was like hold on it was just
[25733.77s -> 25738.25s]  it's just gonna be free like no questions asked the game's free they're like yes if
[25738.25s -> 25742.81s]  they use your code okay that's it the game is just for free it was like a two dollar
[25742.81s -> 25762.14s]  game at the time and now the game is just free years later you sounded defensive no i don't i
[25762.14s -> 25770.88s]  don't do sponsored streams because i don't like the dynamic i don't i don't it doesn't sit well
[25770.88s -> 25777.08s]  with me for a few reasons because of nothing against it if people want to make some extra
[25777.08s -> 25783.34s]  money you know that's fine if it's relevant to what they're doing that's fine but i just i
[25783.42s -> 25790.96s]  just don't like it like why in the name of god would i ever play like some free to play card
[25790.96s -> 25794.80s]  game for like an hour and a half like why would that ever happen you know i would never
[25794.80s -> 25813.40s]  do that what if it's a game you enjoy yeah that's fine but that's not typically how it
[25813.40s -> 25822.28s]  works from my uh last five plus years doing things on the internet it's always like the
[25822.28s -> 25827.64s]  game that nobody actually really wants to play will give you a shitload of money if you play it
[25828.28s -> 25834.11s]  i don't want to do that it's not like i mean sure there are people that have you know sponsored
[25834.11s -> 25838.99s]  streams from companies they know like ubisoft and i mean i've that might not even be real
[25838.99s -> 25845.23s]  but i know that there are large companies that do them but a lot of them are games that
[25845.23s -> 25849.55s]  people might not even really necessarily care about in the first place at least that's how it
[25849.55s -> 25864.16s]  was like on youtube if the makers of 700,000 games offered you 10 grand to play volume 3 would
[25864.16s -> 25871.02s]  you take the money no i'd be like i'll pay for it but the game well actually you know what how
[25871.02s -> 25877.31s]  about this sure i'll do that every single one of those games has to open though and if the
[25877.31s -> 25888.57s]  games if one game on that list doesn't open i get triple the money for each one that doesn't
[25888.57s -> 25900.16s]  open that'll light the fire under the a** to make sure that they work sounds like a good
[25900.16s -> 25920.94s]  deal we've got some shito fan art oh that's really cute it's like everybody loves shito
[25921.82s -> 25929.02s]  if a game developer sent you a game copy or review copy would you take it no and here's the
[25929.02s -> 25934.14s]  reason why here are the reasons why i don't do sponsored streams i don't like to take
[25934.14s -> 25941.82s]  free games or press games press copies because i think about it differently if i get a copy of
[25941.82s -> 25947.66s]  a game for free or if i get a sponsored game it will change the way that i talk it'll change
[25947.66s -> 25952.46s]  the way that i do things because i know that this was given to me or this was sponsored and
[25952.46s -> 25960.27s]  i have it just is in the back of my mind me paying for a game or me just buying it and
[25960.27s -> 25966.04s]  doing whatever i want with it i am at my own free will to do whatever i want if i were
[25966.04s -> 25971.40s]  to take a game for free and then say a bunch of shit about it it'd be like okay well
[25971.72s -> 25982.99s]  like hey wait wait why are you doing that i would rather not hinder anything that i ever
[25982.99s -> 25989.66s]  wanted to say or do because i know a lot of sponsored streams they say hey you can kind
[25989.66s -> 25994.94s]  of say what you want but don't do anything don't be so bad oh you know i don't know i would be
[25994.94s -> 25998.54s]  afraid that somebody would rip my fucking contract in half because i'd come across like
[25998.54s -> 26001.66s]  a bug that i didn't like and i'd be like fuck this game and all of a sudden it was like
[26002.22s -> 26017.92s]  the piano fucking falls from the ceiling it's like if you get a christmas present you have
[26017.92s -> 26024.28s]  to pretend to like it yeah but i'm not even sure the the answer is pretending to like it it's just
[26024.28s -> 26031.69s]  knowing that it was given to you for a reason there's pretending to like it and then there's
[26031.69s -> 26043.80s]  knowing that you were given this thing for a very specific reason it's also difficult to
[26043.80s -> 26049.69s]  judge something fairly if you didn't yeah but i mean for journalistic journalistic approach
[26050.49s -> 26053.87s]  right like if you were like a journalistic outlet if you're like a game reviewer
[26054.51s -> 26060.67s]  or it i don't think there's that this maybe there's not something actually wrong with it
[26061.47s -> 26071.92s]  if your company is based around doing full-on like breakdowns of games maybe it is maybe that
[26071.92s -> 26083.24s]  goes against it completely feel free to say whatever you want as long as it's not negative
[26083.24s -> 26088.88s]  or discourages people from buying the product i just can't have that living over my head even
[26088.88s -> 26096.54s]  if i like it some people are better with that dealing with promotions you're just not one of
[26096.54s -> 26101.68s]  them yeah and i don't have it look there's i don't have anything wrong with it there's nothing in
[26101.68s -> 26111.96s]  my brain that says that's wrong what you're doing but also keep this in mind too at the
[26111.96s -> 26119.95s]  end of the day you guys are watching a stream and what you see on the stream is what you
[26120.75s -> 26127.63s]  in your in your mind it's something that i have decided that i wanted to show you right
[26128.35s -> 26134.75s]  and if i tell you with this three or four thousand people here hey check this out isn't
[26134.75s -> 26140.89s]  that really cool check it out i don't want to be disingenuous of the things that i'm showing you
[26141.61s -> 26153.40s]  because there's a lot of people that come to streams and they oh i want to what what are you
[26153.40s -> 26161.08s]  doing today oh it's something that you necessarily didn't decide to do you decided to do it but
[26161.08s -> 26166.97s]  for a different reason not because you wanted to show your audience something because maybe
[26167.05s -> 26172.65s]  you were offered money to from a company to show it not necessarily you wanting to do it
[26173.37s -> 26182.59s]  and it's nothing to do with honesty it really did i it i did say i used the word disingenuous
[26185.00s -> 26190.14s]  but if i let's just put this way if i got fucking 10 grand to play a shitty mobile game
[26190.14s -> 26194.30s]  on stream and pretend i was having fun some of you guys would download it and you'd be
[26194.30s -> 26200.46s]  like this game sucked this was stupid why did he do that oh he did he took a bunch of money
[26200.46s -> 26214.86s]  okay i guess right like they would that's the reason i think it's nice that you want to show
[26214.86s -> 26225.23s]  us something that you'd really enjoy or at least try to enjoy i mean that's from my view that's
[26225.23s -> 26231.87s]  what i want to do here and the money coming in people talking about money and making money and
[26232.67s -> 26244.65s]  there's a shitload of money comes in already a lot so i mean could i make more money could
[26244.65s -> 26249.61s]  i make way more money i don't maybe if i took a bunch of sponsored streams and deals but i
[26249.61s -> 26261.79s]  don't like i don't have to do that i don't like need to do that and if i can just kind of do my
[26261.79s -> 26267.15s]  thing and not have to worry about taking it like sponsor deals or but that lies down obviously
[26268.59s -> 26272.35s]  the reason why i'm able to do that is because so many people do sub to the stream and do
[26272.35s -> 26277.16s]  give money so i don't like i don't have to go get like oh i'm gonna get i want to get
[26277.16s -> 26286.11s]  like a ten thousand dollar sponsorship it's not it's not really that necessary because
[26286.11s -> 26289.63s]  like you guys already you guys already do that you already give a shitload of money
[26290.27s -> 26299.50s]  there's maybe a weird question but how do you handle such a large amount of donations tax wise
[26301.84s -> 26307.92s]  uh it's i mean it's just it's classified as you know like income like tips it's just money
[26310.51s -> 26316.97s]  goes through twitch even with paypal it's still classified as tips right and you have to
[26317.61s -> 26333.96s]  pay taxes on tips stop having integrity but i but i don't want to come off as like the
[26334.68s -> 26342.89s]  i'm the last bastion of integrity on the platform no there are plenty of ways to
[26343.53s -> 26352.30s]  run a live stream and there are plenty of other people that don't do like sponsors
[26353.02s -> 26363.95s]  there are a lot of them i'm not the only one and like i've said 10 minutes ago i don't i don't
[26363.95s -> 26388.52s]  have a negative attitude towards somebody that does classified actually means he doesn't do his
[26388.52s -> 26400.89s]  taxes wait what i have i have i i'm about to do them in like i'm about to file my return
[26400.89s -> 26410.33s]  probably in a week or two so and i got a actually have i have a very very good cpa
[26411.50s -> 26424.64s]  very trustworthy evading you know just jerma ignore this message i can't you have the one
[26424.64s -> 26436.54s]  guy emailed there teach us how to do taxes it's uh all right you want to know how to do
[26436.54s -> 26443.98s]  your taxes dip yourself in fucking like just get just buy like a giant fryer later
[26444.94s -> 26456.88s]  and then dip yourself in it on max heat that's what it's like buy the tune liquid from
[26456.88s -> 26480.19s]  who framed roger rabbit and just slowly sit in it sounds about right just eat the paper
[26480.83s -> 26495.79s]  but it won't work we aren't tunes um what what you're on a tune stream right now
[26495.79s -> 26507.53s]  hey how do you feel about urinals let me tell you something all right let's move on now spend a
[26507.53s -> 26516.14s]  lot of time talking about that but it's nice to discuss it every now and again because there
[26516.14s -> 26523.56s]  there are pros and cons to all these things you know like think about that to put one
[26523.56s -> 26529.48s]  last point into that conversation imagine if i did a couple of sponsor streams and then all
[26529.48s -> 26534.92s]  the sudden that pays for jerma rumble too you know what i mean like there there are
[26534.92s -> 26543.64s]  pros and cons but the cons for me have always out kind of grown i mean the cons the cons have
[26543.64s -> 26549.84s]  outgrown the pros for me pretty much every time i think about it i've thought about it a lot
[26551.64s -> 26554.52s]  this ain't something that i've just kind of hey let's talk about this now
[26555.24s -> 26565.96s]  i internalize this all the time but thank you dan with wings that was where we left off
[26566.68s -> 26570.68s]  uh drum age thank you drum edge for the one dollar hey you probably don't even remember
[26570.68s -> 26579.74s]  the cheer about lisa uh and begging for it but still want to apologize for it it was wasted
[26581.04s -> 26590.06s]  as fuck like right now no don't worry about it don't worry about that it's all right you've
[26590.06s -> 26594.14s]  recommended a game to me oh no i think i know what you're talking about when i brought up
[26595.10s -> 26599.82s]  moving to another game and i just used the word lisa i think that's because you were the
[26599.82s -> 26604.70s]  last message that i saw about a game recommendation and that was just the last
[26604.70s -> 26610.16s]  game recommendation that i saw there's nothing to do with what you said or how you said it or
[26610.16s -> 26619.20s]  something no you you you you were the one guy and that's how that happened people have been
[26619.20s -> 26625.82s]  asking for lisa a trillion times i suggested a year ago yeah but okay every time somebody
[26625.82s -> 26634.16s]  suggests lisa they are sandwiched by two people saying don't play lisa you know there's like
[26634.16s -> 26651.98s]  a i just like burped really loud and then hopefully the music covered it if anyone
[26651.98s -> 26661.24s]  doesn't want lisa play it now it's a good ass game series but i feel like it's not for you
[26664.30s -> 26673.08s]  maybe i don't know you should not play lisa it's too sad to make it a fun stream that's kind of
[26673.08s -> 26678.59s]  what i hear that it's a great game but streaming it is like it's a sad game
[26679.39s -> 26684.19s]  and it wouldn't be like a fun stream it would be like a sad stream is that accurate
[26685.23s -> 26702.72s]  you'd have to take it seriously we'll see i'll put it on the list i don't know
[26703.36s -> 26708.73s]  that's tough because i want to be like sad on stream i don't want to be sad in general either
[26710.16s -> 26714.64s]  but thank you uh drummage for the one dollar two dollars here could you check out age of empires
[26714.64s -> 26720.24s]  too for lulls sometime if not could you at least give your thoughts on it if i even know
[26720.24s -> 26725.28s]  what it is it's one of the original real time strategy games that predated everything else
[26725.28s -> 26733.00s]  i know what it is i watched a guy play that on a plane when i was like 14 i was sitting
[26733.08s -> 26738.68s]  in the aisle seat and he was one row above and in the aisle seat to the right so he was
[26738.68s -> 26745.72s]  diagonal to me and he had a laptop on the plane i had to have been like 14 or 15 at the time
[26745.72s -> 26751.72s]  he was older he was probably in his like mid to late 30s and i was just sitting there
[26751.72s -> 26756.35s]  watching him play and eventually he like noticed i was watching because i was just
[26756.35s -> 26763.71s]  staring at a screen and i said what is that and he said this is uh age of uh age of kings
[26765.58s -> 26774.32s]  it's age of age of empires too is age of kings right age of kings yeah i got it
[26774.32s -> 26786.32s]  age of empires too age of kings and i remember going oh this is great watch he was the game's
[26786.32s -> 26800.75s]  lead developer i just caught this right here in the chat here uh roshimi uh swift recently
[26800.75s -> 26805.47s]  diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis any good recipes or any lifestyle changes i should try
[26806.19s -> 26816.24s]  i understand you've had issues and i just wanted your input yeah i i don't know what your uh
[26816.24s -> 26820.16s]  plan is for your doctor i don't know what your what they're going to try first because
[26820.16s -> 26827.63s]  there are a couple of different options for treatment but lifestyle wise at least initially
[26827.63s -> 26834.65s]  you have to kind of start ruling out stuff that you can't really eat for a while i
[26834.65s -> 26839.29s]  couldn't drink even i don't know i'm not sure how old you are but i couldn't drink a sip of alcohol
[26840.33s -> 26847.77s]  if i even drank like one beer or like one cocktail it would be living hell the next like
[26847.77s -> 26857.00s]  three or four days so for some people have their own internal uh issues and some foods
[26857.00s -> 26864.30s]  affect people differently especially if you have colitis i've since got into a pretty good
[26865.26s -> 26873.77s]  run here where i haven't had any really major problems i still do have problems but you know
[26873.77s -> 26879.95s]  i won't really discuss them on stream because they're kind of uh very disgusting and very
[26879.95s -> 26894.32s]  not i don't i don't i don't think i'd want to share the that stuff on stream but uh wait hold
[26894.32s -> 26899.10s]  on i'll touch on that in a second somebody just said about me being a kid in 1999
[26900.06s -> 26909.18s]  you would have been a teenager i was like i said 14 or 15 right 2009 2019 that was 20 years ago
[26909.98s -> 26919.00s]  so i'm 33 23 30 i was like that's 13 and i said 14 what are you talking about your math is off
[26919.00s -> 26932.40s]  my math is correct but uh you really need to just kind of look at your diet you start to rule
[26932.40s -> 26942.67s]  out fried stuff fatty stuff and some people can eat whatever they want and make sure you
[26942.67s -> 26952.30s]  get a good doctor that's going to give you a good treatment plan ask about it's a very
[26952.30s -> 26959.26s]  expensive drug unfortunately for some dumb fucking reason but one of the things because
[26959.26s -> 26967.02s]  i had mine started to localize itself i don't know where yours is but the drug is
[26967.02s -> 26974.30s]  is kanasa is the drug and it helped me a lot because mine was a little bit lower
[26975.10s -> 26985.02s]  i'm not going to give you any recommendations for what you should take for drugs
[26985.66s -> 26993.76s]  but i had a lot of issues that eventually after a couple of endoscopies the doctors were like
[26993.76s -> 27006.12s]  you know it's localized a little bit lower so we're going to put you on this it's a
[27006.68s -> 27013.42s]  met meslamine meslamine it's like an aspirin kind of uh derivative
[27014.06s -> 27019.16s]  scheduled for a colonoscopy in a couple weeks but i was hospitalized for a good week due to
[27019.16s -> 27025.80s]  pain that's why i started seeing a gi specialist will definitely continue to see that specialist
[27026.52s -> 27034.00s]  because you might get a little discouraged and not care and not want to do it oh i
[27034.00s -> 27037.44s]  got to go in and get it scoped i got to get scoped i got what do i try this
[27038.40s -> 27043.60s]  it's really easy to like kind of just fall down into like a depression and not give a fuck anymore
[27043.60s -> 27051.88s]  but keep going make sure that you get that doctor you on the right page then try to take
[27051.88s -> 27059.85s]  care of yourself and get yourself into remission it's a huge pain but i feel pretty good right
[27059.85s -> 27079.45s]  now and i did not 10 years ago not at all so i can relate for real i wish you the best i
[27079.45s -> 27088.80s]  wish you the best of luck hopefully you and your doctor can figure out a good plan i thought
[27088.80s -> 27096.92s]  i was lactose intolerant at first yeah when i first started having problems it was i went
[27096.92s -> 27101.74s]  through i mean i'm not going to be disgusting or anything but there was a bunch of weird
[27101.74s -> 27108.88s]  shit that i did that the doctor was checking for it took it took it was after i got
[27108.88s -> 27113.12s]  scoped for the first time that really it was okay i think this is what you have
[27114.00s -> 27119.40s]  and from there i got put on a couple of drugs that i really didn't like
[27120.12s -> 27131.45s]  and it's kind of sucks that i was on them for a while i don't even know if they still prescribe
[27131.45s -> 27145.55s]  it which is kind of terrifying in its own right i mean i wonder if this medicine even still
[27145.55s -> 27166.41s]  exists yeah it does yeah i was on imuran for a long time and i really didn't like it
[27167.98s -> 27172.14s]  but it may have been one of the reasons why i went into remission i don't know
[27172.14s -> 27180.25s]  but i fucking hated that drug i hated being on that drug because there's a lot of weird
[27181.13s -> 27207.53s]  issues with it imagine jerma as a celebrity i don't think i want to imagine that they
[27207.53s -> 27213.74s]  definitely still prescribe imuran i was on it until last year so that yes they do i don't know
[27213.74s -> 27218.73s]  if they still did it because there's a there's a lot of literature that i can really help it's
[27218.73s -> 27223.85s]  an immunomodulator they prescribe it to people that do like kidney transplant it's like a
[27223.85s -> 27230.43s]  transplant acceptor drug but it does have some weird effects on crones and colitis
[27231.39s -> 27238.84s]  and ibd symptoms so it just weird that just freaked me out taking it like an immunomodulator
[27238.84s -> 27250.99s]  like if it's fucking with my dna but anyways i wish you the best of luck take care of yourself
[27250.99s -> 27260.04s]  listen to your doctor and get a good plan but anyways uh age of empire age of kings
[27260.04s -> 27270.83s]  i'm aware of it and i think it was cool dub ski dude thanks for the one dollar dragons dog
[27270.99s -> 27275.79s]  is a special game to me the most legendary gaming fail of my entire life happened in this game
[27276.75s -> 27284.51s]  i was soloing the ur dragon it's a secret boss with like 20 health bars and it literally took
[27284.51s -> 27291.72s]  six hours for me to beat when i finally killed it it hit me with petrified i desperately tried
[27291.72s -> 27296.60s]  to loot the corpse but turned to stone and died before i could grab anything and i lost
[27296.60s -> 27315.55s]  the loot forever i literally wanted to eat my own head that sucks six hours that is rough
[27315.55s -> 27321.85s]  that's very rough and that's the kind of stuff i can look forward to then bring it on sounds
[27321.85s -> 27327.26s]  fun thank you dork cube for the one dollar this game looks beautiful and ugly at the same time
[27327.26s -> 27332.68s]  it's because i don't have the mods to make it look better that was my fault mind my halo
[27333.87s -> 27337.47s]  thank you for the ten dollars smelly boy thank you for the one dollar
[27338.03s -> 27358.92s]  where is shito show me proof that he's alive he's saying i am alive he's alive all right
[27358.92s -> 27371.92s]  you ready to go back to bed good night pre-recorded shito uh thank you
[27371.92s -> 27385.50s]  for the three bucks they say it had to be done i can't tell is did you what is
[27385.50s -> 27392.30s]  this an image of my eyes on that character is this the willem defoe face i don't know it's
[27392.30s -> 27396.28s]  freaking me out i can't look at that for more than five seconds don't look at that picture
[27396.28s -> 27402.67s]  before you sleep it'll that that monster will come out of your mirror or something
[27404.09s -> 27408.57s]  hey smelly boy thanks for the one dollar who's your favorite animator on new grounds
[27410.17s -> 27416.44s]  blow it out really hey mostly lost thanks for the one dollar your resistance and
[27416.44s -> 27421.16s]  hesitation to use any stupid jokey characters is even funnier than the characters themselves
[27421.64s -> 27428.97s]  especially since we all know you'll give in eventually well i did i played with two
[27428.97s -> 27439.42s]  characters that had poop in their name there was poop but and then like poop master so it
[27439.42s -> 27445.42s]  happened i told you 30 percent of the characters have that word or a variant of that in their
[27445.42s -> 27452.11s]  name you're not going to be able to do a full playthrough of this game and not have
[27452.11s -> 27456.99s]  one character in your party whose name is like poopoo dick it's not going to happen it's
[27456.99s -> 27459.31s]  going to happen because you're going to have the right spells and abilities that you're going
[27459.31s -> 27463.80s]  to need and you're going to want to bring them in just for like a couple minutes to do one mission
[27472.32s -> 27476.40s]  i can't believe somebody gave me all the end game items like what the hell that i'm actually
[27476.40s -> 27480.96s]  like kind of sad i just realized that i did that just image just popped up in my brain
[27480.96s -> 27491.47s]  right now thank you carrot seven for the one dollar i fell asleep during your character
[27491.47s -> 27497.71s]  creation woke up to a brave soul named poop butt being eaten by a hydra i like this game
[27500.80s -> 27514.62s]  that was so fucking funny and the fact that a bunch of people said that they've never seen
[27514.62s -> 27520.24s]  that cut scene before because i took too long to fight the tutorial boss but that was because

[28232.78s -> 28240.70s]  because the last move thanos i know i know it's like okay yeah bro you like that because
[28240.70s -> 28252.80s]  of the last movie that came out probably thanos is a villain well they said they said who is
[28252.80s -> 28259.20s]  your favorite super person nightwing aquaman green goblin they put a villain in the question
[28259.84s -> 28273.48s]  i think i think thanos is a great character now we talk about on the good side not just a
[28273.48s -> 28290.04s]  villain thanos is actually pretty good in infinity war movie thanos or comic thanos i
[28290.04s -> 28294.94s]  mean yeah there are differences and i know the whole story i know thanos's entire story
[28297.34s -> 28301.90s]  but for every time i bring up something that somebody hasn't seen yet i get screamed after
[28301.90s -> 28311.96s]  spoilers you have no idea what comic thanos is oh well i'll block your ears for a second everybody
[28311.96s -> 28316.28s]  if you don't want to hear anything the whole uh three two one i don't know what i think i think
[28316.28s -> 28321.24s]  about thanos except the fact that his entire life is about trying to please and uh fall
[28321.24s -> 28325.56s]  in love with the actual embodiment of death and that's why he does the things that he does
[28325.56s -> 28330.84s]  because he's trying to impress death pretty interesting take on the comic book version of
[28330.84s -> 28349.84s]  the thanos he read the wikipedia i read the comic book i have it i own it okay you can listen now
[28354.92s -> 28360.97s]  show it on stream you want to show it on stream fine let no way actually that didn't
[28360.97s -> 28384.92s]  i got lost in the mail during the move i gave it to my uh my nephew yeah you didn't even
[28384.92s -> 28400.08s]  know that it got lost and then you gave it to your nephew huh no no no he's trying to
[28400.08s -> 28404.64s]  make the embodiment of death and that's why he does the things that he does
[28404.64s -> 28411.60s]  he travels from planet to planet and look guy that has one talking point repeat the same
[28411.60s -> 28424.20s]  talking point but change the sentence a little bit good job you read his tldr wiki all right
[28424.20s -> 28431.77s]  what do you know about him huh what do you know about him if you're such an expert let's
[28431.77s -> 28439.93s]  hear it oh yeah you remember hey block your ears everybody block your ears if you don't want
[28439.93s -> 28446.65s]  to hear any thanos spoilers three two one the fact that the fight with wolverine the fight with
[28446.65s -> 28450.97s]  deadpool the fact that deadpool is the only one that could even hurt him in the first place
[28450.97s -> 28456.41s]  because he didn't really lose the fight against deadpool deadpool just was annoying because he
[28456.41s -> 28461.45s]  wouldn't die so thanos just got bored and it turned out to be a victory for deadpool
[28461.45s -> 28474.60s]  you remember that you read that one i just made that up that means that i have more
[28474.60s -> 28480.12s]  knowledge of the superhero universe than gondor lane does i will take the victory thank you very
[28480.12s -> 28495.21s]  much leveled up to a level one million you have the wiki i don't have the wiki open

[28516.56s -> 28522.88s]  superhero i don't know doctor fucking strange or spider-man or venom no i let's go back sorry
[28523.20s -> 28528.48s]  it's not thanos no what the fuck am i talking about it's not venom either it's carnage carnage
[28528.48s -> 28536.14s]  is my favorite super hero or villain i love carnage is a great character it's carnage what
[28536.14s -> 28542.22s]  do you know about carnage separation anxiety storyline the it's one of my favorite actual like
[28542.22s -> 28547.66s]  no jokes aside not kidding or anything the separation anxiety story arc with spider-man
[28547.66s -> 28557.48s]  venom and carnage is one is my favorite marvel storyline and i would love if they would actually
[28557.48s -> 28572.81s]  do it eventually what about ant-man though no fuck ant-man they took honey i shrunk the kids
[28572.81s -> 28577.12s]  and made paul rudd say some jokes it's like they tell honey i shrunk the kids but they
[28577.12s -> 28587.84s]  give the kids superpowers i've already seen that movie i'm i'm kidding i'm kidding that's
[28587.84s -> 28599.40s]  a joke that was an expert ant-man analysis i'm just i'm just pushing buttons right now
[28599.40s -> 28604.68s]  don't you understand i almost just pushed the camera on button as a joke like i'm pressing
[28604.68s -> 28619.29s]  buttons and i don't have clothes on so that would have been bad he likes to start shit i'm
[28619.29s -> 28625.93s]  just kidding around but venom is one of my favorite carnages i just like the symbiotes
[28625.93s -> 28631.00s]  they're interesting something about them are cool is the spider-man symbiote was really
[28631.00s -> 28636.76s]  interesting the fact that he could have used it and he did but he didn't want to i like
[28636.76s -> 28640.28s]  that whole arc the whole arc with venom and carnage is really interesting to me
[28641.00s -> 28647.47s]  because they're not just two there are a shitload of symbiotes there are like at least four or five
[28647.47s -> 28653.84s]  suits because there's a whole race of aliens didn't need the wikipedia open for that one did i
[28656.46s -> 28661.37s]  how did this even start oh yeah that's my favorite villain thank you tingy for the
[28661.37s -> 28664.97s]  one dollar thank you divas p for the one dollar thank you bet three for the two dollars
[28665.61s -> 28674.99s]  hi jerma hi bet three i have not seen into the spider-verse i've heard it is unbelievable
[28674.99s -> 28686.35s]  so can't wait they're not a race of aliens the earth suits all split from venom there's a whole
[28686.35s -> 28696.16s]  alien race of those symbiotes just because they were children of venom because he ate after
[28696.16s -> 28713.20s]  midnight doesn't mean there's not a whole planet full of them thank you tingy for the
[28713.20s -> 28718.89s]  two dollars thank you give us p for another two dollars why are you doing this i don't know
[28718.89s -> 28725.82s]  why are you doing this thank you kill code for the one dollar hey germa old clip time
[28725.82s -> 28731.69s]  hope you enjoy don't dodge here that's the one thing i remember about blight town
[28732.33s -> 28749.02s]  do not dodge ever don't ever do it you will regret it i know a lot of people think
[28749.90s -> 28756.57s]  that some of this shit is on purpose like i'm trying to bait reactions or something or i'm
[28756.57s -> 28765.37s]  doing it to try to play up something no that i i don't i don't mean to that didn't happen
[28775.37s -> 28781.37s]  sometimes of course i do some of these things on purpose but you all know when that is because we
[28781.37s -> 28789.04s]  talk about them in real time or there's a joke that's being made but stuff like that i that
[28789.04s -> 28795.02s]  that that happens what was the last time that that happened and i went on like an actual
[28795.02s -> 28798.30s]  meltdown about how people were going to think this was a joke and a lie and i was like
[28798.30s -> 28809.84s]  pretending it was pretty recent it was like a couple of streams ago what was it the slap
[28809.92s -> 28821.26s]  yep the slap that's exactly that's yep but how could i i read a thread and somebody wrote he
[28821.26s -> 28828.46s]  literally did the most impossible physically mechanically impossible way to slap yourself
[28828.46s -> 28840.64s]  it has to been fake it was something along those lines i read it and i'm just like
[28841.44s -> 28849.47s]  uh i almost wish it was on purpose because then at least internally it wouldn't be that
[28849.47s -> 28862.28s]  embarrassing i've never seen anyone do that yeah i just got too amped up but i got too into like
[28862.28s -> 28870.32s]  the joke and i overestimated how far i had to go and i had to preview of all the things
[28870.32s -> 28879.37s]  to turn the webcam on and do hitting yourself in the fucking face i still can't believe it
[28882.38s -> 28891.87s]  fake slap it's fake oh and spilling and running into the uh uh buckets of water
[28891.87s -> 28896.75s]  in viscera cleanup detail none of those were fucking fake they were all real all of them
[28896.75s -> 28910.24s]  jerma i refuse to believe it's real i tried to replicate what you did and every time my hand
[28910.24s -> 28920.54s]  refused to slap my face but i i don't i was trying look here's the thought process here
[28920.54s -> 28927.24s]  i'm gonna try to explain this as best as i can i did it twice what three times right
[28927.24s -> 28933.24s]  the first time i was moving very slow and it wasn't that funny because it wasn't fast
[28933.80s -> 28939.72s]  so oh look i'm trying to pretend oh i missed you and i three stooges but in my mind it wasn't
[28939.72s -> 28947.88s]  as funny because my hand wasn't moving that fast so future me decided i'm gonna move my hand
[28947.88s -> 28953.32s]  really fucking fast so when i have the slap noise play it'll be it'll be perfect and it'll
[28953.32s -> 28962.52s]  actually look funny i'm trying really hard to replicate it and i can't don't don't try to
[28962.52s -> 28967.40s]  replicate don't try to slap yourself in the face no don't do that don't try this at home
[28969.66s -> 28973.10s]  hey sweat night thanks for the ten dollar sweat night hey jerma glad to see you're enjoying
[28973.10s -> 28977.74s]  dragon's dogma so much as is one of my favorite rpg games despite all of its flaws
[28978.38s -> 28982.86s]  if you want another great game by the same director i would strongly recommend devil may
[28982.86s -> 28988.86s]  cry three like dark souls it often gets a bad rap for being extremely hard but once you
[28988.86s -> 28992.78s]  get into it you'll see that it's a great game with some of the funnest combat and cut scenes
[28992.78s -> 28998.46s]  in video game history not that difficult not that difficulty should be a problem for you
[28999.18s -> 29010.11s]  you god gamer and then the new devil may cry is coming out there's so many video games
[29010.75s -> 29016.64s]  eventually there's going to be video game libraries because that's what happened with
[29016.64s -> 29022.65s]  books think about that too many books were written so they had to start to make giant
[29022.65s -> 29028.64s]  buildings to put them in places back when they were like 40 books that were written
[29029.28s -> 29035.60s]  that didn't matter now we got entire gigantic structures to hold the shit load of books that
[29035.60s -> 29037.84s]  have been written that's going to happen they're going to be video game libraries
[29038.48s -> 29053.80s]  it's called the internet yeah but it'll be you can there'll be a card catalog you go
[29053.80s -> 29060.60s]  through g g god of god of war goddess god of war one god of war two god of war three god of
[29060.60s -> 29068.36s]  war five god of war attack of the clones god of war and then in brackets 2018 god like there's
[29068.36s -> 29086.25s]  gonna be 30 god of wars there gears of war gears of war two gears of war three gears of real
[29086.25s -> 29090.84s]  mobile gears of war four gears of war five gears of four six you think they're gonna stop

[29420.46s -> 29425.31s]  tingy thanks for the two dollars here i wanted to see how long it would take you to notice
[29425.31s -> 29430.11s]  me doing that right went from one dollar per stream to this today because it was taking
[29430.11s -> 29438.62s]  too long by the way it took six dollars for you to catch it but what was it for me to
[29438.62s -> 29446.41s]  i was just reading your message i knew what you were doing but i just i just was i knew what
[29446.41s -> 29453.05s]  you were doing i have stream labs it has a who sent the bits it's not like i could couldn't
[29453.05s -> 29461.61s]  tell who sent them what fingers are your favorite least favorite uh index and thumb no middle
[29461.61s -> 29468.19s]  finger and thumb are my favorite fingers i hate ring finger it sucks it's stupid they're
[29468.19s -> 29471.87s]  always in a weird spot it's hard to move them around it's hard to maneuver them they
[29471.87s -> 29481.32s]  hurt sometimes trying to do certain tasks hey demonic cucumber thanks for the one dollar
[29481.32s -> 29486.04s]  i've always wondered do you actually read comics if so what's your poll list if you
[29486.04s -> 29491.88s]  don't i'd recommend the current venom and carnage runs also venom which is venom but
[29491.88s -> 29504.36s]  set in the vietnam war that's really interesting uh i mean i i have in the past but all the
[29504.36s -> 29509.74s]  jokes aside i don't currently read any i think the last actual comic book that i opened
[29510.38s -> 29515.48s]  was probably civil war that's probably the last one that i opened and looked at and was like i'm
[29515.48s -> 29523.00s]  gonna read this see his clicks i hear them but my hands are on my desk folded like a fucking villain
[29523.80s -> 29540.35s]  do i use old school obs i do i use uh obs studio i don't use the stream labs one you
[29540.35s -> 29547.53s]  complained a lot about wwe 2k 17 18 19 why not the next rumble go back to 2k 14 uh i've
[29547.53s -> 29550.33s]  talked about a couple of the reasons why the number one reason is because it just takes
[29550.33s -> 29558.76s]  too long to load once you have 20 30 40 characters made in 2k 14 and once you have
[29558.76s -> 29565.08s]  10 20 plus layers on one character it can take 30 to 40 seconds to load hair on somebody
[29566.04s -> 29575.18s]  it's just it doesn't hold up if they was a 2k 14 for pc they decided in 2k 15 forward
[29575.18s -> 29581.52s]  to put them on pc but that's the last one that's the last really good creator it just
[29581.52s -> 29587.82s]  doesn't hold up old playstation 3 hardware late generation playstation 3 game trying to just
[29587.82s -> 29597.20s]  dump as much shit as they can so it just takes too long to make one character especially if you
[29597.20s -> 29609.23s]  want to do a lot of stuff to them the creativity was nice i know and they got rid
[29609.23s -> 29612.67s]  of the whole cinematic stuff where you could make your own little stories and have weird
[29612.67s -> 29619.68s]  shit happen with characters it really is too bad but they it's too bad they made that a
[29619.68s -> 29630.24s]  sports simulation game oh well you should be able to emulate it emulating playstation 3 games is
[29630.24s -> 29638.89s]  just so finicky half of them don't even work it's really hard to do some of the emulators
[29638.89s -> 29644.01s]  are better than others but i've had so many problems trying to get past the playstation
[29644.01s -> 29657.21s]  1 era emulators to work even remotely correctly we're not far enough into technology i think to
[29657.21s -> 29664.27s]  be able to truly emulate like last gen games it's just i don't think it's there yet and it
[29664.27s -> 29669.85s]  might not ever be because it's really easy to emulate the data that was on a cartridge
[29670.57s -> 29676.17s]  stuff like super nintendo genesis n64 they're all very emulatable even playstation 1 and into
[29676.17s -> 29688.86s]  playstation 2 somewhat shanesaw five community subs thank you shanesaw thank you so much
[29689.82s -> 29696.36s]  five community subs rpcs3 has a lot of stuff working well at the moment give it another year
[29696.36s -> 29703.69s]  and i bet it's amazing i hope so because if i could use my you know powerful computer to render
[29703.69s -> 29708.33s]  shit that's in a playstation 3 emulated version of 2k14 i would do it in a heartbeat
[29708.89s -> 29718.03s]  but it just doesn't work right now but thank you so much shanes uh shanesaw
[29719.44s -> 29722.24s]  getting close to almost at the end of the bits only a few more left
[29723.68s -> 29727.84s]  thank you to uh demonic cucumber for the one dollar spill joke

[29832.57s -> 29840.32s]  what is this delay i don't know maybe it's uh i don't know that's really weird i jumped with
[29840.32s -> 29845.93s]  the message up because yeah because i read them both kind of at the same time hey talking about
[29845.93s -> 29852.30s]  subs a shitload of community subs are coming tonight why don't we take a look and see the

[29906.25s -> 29920.91s]  canadian club but dragon's dog was a lot of fun i'm not sure the plan tomorrow because there
[29920.91s -> 29930.19s]  are so many options that it's i almost don't know what i'm gonna do it really depends on
[29930.19s -> 29934.59s]  what because there are some things that are planned on coming in for delivery tomorrow
[29935.23s -> 29948.65s]  you can also just play this too dark souls 3 the mods look like a lot of fun one of them in
[29948.65s -> 29955.21s]  particular i thought was really funny is there's a mod for dark souls 3 that randomizes the speed
[29955.21s -> 29967.47s]  of the game so it can go in slow motion up to like fast forward speed that sounds like actual
[29967.47s -> 29974.43s]  help yeah sounds like fun though there's one where you can play as the enemies too that's
[29974.43s -> 29979.07s]  probably good i i have to check them out that's going to be at least a couple streams it has to
[29979.07s -> 29992.22s]  be so basically you got multiple options yeah please do that tomorrow if i can get it to
[29992.22s -> 29996.70s]  work that's going to take a little bit of work though because with any mod or total
[29997.26s -> 30002.06s]  complete scripting or game changing mods there's a tendency for them to take a
[30002.06s -> 30008.73s]  lot of troubleshooting so i'm gonna have to spend some time tomorrow hopefully doing that
[30009.45s -> 30016.19s]  what's gonna be the january 23rd stream january 23rd stream is gonna be an irl hangout stream
[30016.19s -> 30022.83s]  where i wear a full goalie outfit and like duct tape my door closed that stream is only

[30052.40s -> 30057.92s]  at some point in like the late afternoon and then we're gonna just kind of hang out in
[30057.92s -> 30066.16s]  final destination my room it said that it said it oh shit bro okay all right never
