[1697.35s -> 1706.60s]  game. I know everyone wanted me to complete this but this is dog shit. Let's be honest. We gotta
[1706.60s -> 1712.84s]  be completely upfront. Doing like the pipe dream puzzle over and over again like a thousand times.
[1712.92s -> 1731.51s]  This game just sucks. I should really just run around and get all the couplers. Mad because bad.
[1732.78s -> 1738.22s]  No I'm. I am bad. You're right. But oh my god. Why do you want. Who wants to do like five of these

[1900.55s -> 1934.57s]  I'm embarrassed for them. Go outside in. Go out. I turned it off. Are there cheat codes for this game?
[1934.73s -> 1942.68s]  Just a cheat and his fucking no clip through the door. There's four of those puzzles. There's five
[1942.68s -> 1946.60s]  puzzles in seven minutes. That means I have to do every puzzle in less than one minute.
[1947.16s -> 1961.50s]  Is that even possible to do that in seven minutes? This has to be the last room of the game.
[1975.62s -> 1985.54s]  You wish. It's just too. It's too much man. It's just too. It's too. It's too many things to look at.
[1985.54s -> 1990.10s]  It's too confusing. It's just. Shut up. Turn the fucking TV off. I don't want to hear him anymore.

[2203.42s -> 2284.52s]  puzzle right back to back. Six minutes. This is fun. Outside in. Oh this one. No. No. No.
[2284.52s -> 2298.71s]  I don't understand how this is wrong. Fuck. Oh. Oh. Oh. Okay. We got it. We got it. We got it.

[2356.74s -> 2361.38s]  to be connected here. This has to be connected to here. But then you lose this fucking thing.
[2363.48s -> 2385.29s]  And then I don't understand. I don't understand. Is this the last piece? I have to pause the game.
[2385.29s -> 2390.90s]  Oh my god. I hate this fucking game with a passion. This is the worst game I've ever played on stream.
[2390.90s -> 2401.62s]  I want to drop kick this fucking disk into the dumpster. Okay. You ready? I'm taking a screenshot

[3928.27s -> 3957.56s]  exist I let's see if I can do this there better be a gun in here on explosive
[3957.56s -> 3964.18s]  trap schematics and shotgun shell pretty much 100% useless I'm glad I used a
[3964.18s -> 3972.86s]  lockpick to get in here all right let's do it whatever it is
[3972.86s -> 3986.14s]  Saucon here I don't know what the combo is okay how long stick to brute force a
[3986.18s -> 4010.47s]  three-digit password let's start at zero I'm not gonna do that I'm kidding we
[4010.47s -> 4041.74s]  didn't even get a code depends please I'm not gonna do that 643 823 375 74
[4041.74s -> 4071.01s]  find it 128 find the numbers I thought I just said it right there all right fine

[4149.18s -> 4182.59s]  storage you have the code what's the code still a music I was a shit turns on
[4182.71s -> 4194.42s]  it's 181 well I'm already dip Marty down here so we're all right all right down
[4194.42s -> 4213.59s]  here blah blah blah blah blah yeah yeah whatever whatever whatever here comes
[4213.59s -> 4217.75s]  the code the code if he needs me we're gonna get in the code I have the code
[4217.75s -> 4228.30s]  no code the flashlight up already have one this dude's gonna jump around the
[4228.30s -> 4248.54s]  corner like what do you think I'm stupid well you have an idiot another person
[4248.66s -> 4276.58s]  down here Dean venture all right let's do it remember go to sock on for the
[4276.58s -> 4284.10s]  code there's no such thing as sock on a guy in a saw mask shows up at like the
[4284.10s -> 4309.12s]  horror fest 2018 or whatever but not here holy shit I almost just died didn't
[4309.12s -> 4334.62s]  I you were trapped in the room ten minutes to play the hardest level of

[4417.89s -> 4427.82s]  anyways who will help I need it you know enter the code yeah I don't know what
[4427.82s -> 4443.82s]  the code is yet maybe I'll find the code here how much less ridiculous this one
[4443.82s -> 4453.10s]  is by the way this one is not even close to being as insane as the other ones
[4453.10s -> 4485.65s]  have been good button are they both open let's go anything else in here that I
[4485.65s -> 4503.38s]  need to get a medical cabinet it's not good and it is nice like I could steal
[4503.38s -> 4510.21s]  the Adderall did I really do all this today I could have just skipped this by
[4510.21s -> 4539.10s]  putting the code in was that already walking like all right now I got a
[4539.10s -> 4546.91s]  weapon underneath I'm not I shouldn't be scared because there's no monsters and
[4546.91s -> 4549.55s]  saws not like a giant dead space monsters gonna I mean I might look like
[4549.59s -> 4553.77s]  the dead space guy right now like the thing like doesn't have like a thing on
[4553.77s -> 4578.58s]  his shoulders I was on his back nevermind okay I take the shotgun oh I
[4578.58s -> 4590.30s]  armed the trap somebody's gonna burst out of the door here what the hell is it
[4590.30s -> 4630.58s]  here guilt you guys had already he already killed him this is pre-recorded
[4630.58s -> 4640.04s]  all right so he's dead find a light bulb within the staff housing find a light

[4713.27s -> 4720.21s]  the staff room we got wisdom is the stupid ass staff room current position
[4720.21s -> 4739.31s]  the objective circle I don't know I have no goddamn idea why it was wasn't
[4739.31s -> 4774.86s]  something loading I hear a guy code what oh shit 038 some of you guys almost got
[4774.90s -> 4784.24s]  it too 838 how did you you were close I find a light bulb in the cafeteria
[4784.24s -> 4793.99s]  probably gonna need to use these okay there's a guy's gonna blow through here
[4793.99s -> 4807.82s]  with a chainsaw there's the other chainsaw I know he's coming where is he
[4807.82s -> 4821.53s]  you would have solved it faster if you had just done your strategy of counting
[4821.53s -> 4830.23s]  up from zero that actually would have happened you're right that's ridiculous
[4830.23s -> 4845.24s]  you're right what the hell's even in here crowbar I got a better weapon
[4845.32s -> 4857.15s]  already oh explosive trap can't make it I have gas trap stun trap explosive trap
[4857.15s -> 4872.93s]  I already have like a bunch of shit how do I use this stuff almost died you spam
[4872.93s -> 4884.90s]  Molotov oh yeah all right this is the cat where's the was the thing I gotta
[4884.90s -> 4893.97s]  get in here I'm one of the doors or something I don't know important if you
[4893.97s -> 4897.73s]  ever put a light bulb in your ass it'll get stuck and you can't get it out
[4897.73s -> 4901.01s]  without breaking it and explodes the safest way to remove the bulb without
[4901.01s -> 4905.41s]  maiming yourself is to feed a banana around the bulb what the fuck are you
[4905.41s -> 4925.02s]  talking about a gear I don't know what who's gonna do that why would anybody
[4925.02s -> 4934.54s]  do that what you're describing no one would ever do what you just said no one
[4934.54s -> 4949.51s]  not one person gonna turn that shit off how do I get that how do I get this how
[4949.51s -> 4967.98s]  do I get that off would be in saw no one said ass yes they did yes they did I
[4967.98s -> 4976.38s]  need to turn it where's a valve I gotta turn the valve off somewhere but where

[5026.64s -> 5046.10s]  molotovs with a lighter what happened to the molotovs I just had like a bunch
[5046.10s -> 5056.44s]  of fucking molotovs where'd they go turn that shit off I almost why I'm
[5056.44s -> 5070.96s]  getting so lucky disarming these traps you have no idea but an emote only mode
[5070.96s -> 5090.95s]  important if you put a light bulb yeah what what before look out oh before
[5090.95s -> 5113.91s]  cooking oh before look out you know what I'm trying to say
[5113.91s -> 5119.54s]  oh before cooking in the freezer whatever I'm supposed to put in here
[5119.54s -> 5136.26s]  the key nothing in this shit milk you piss jerk feed the grinder to get the
[5136.26s -> 5145.28s]  key I feed the grinder what like my own arm eat the grinder to get the key can
[5145.28s -> 5169.28s]  I put my own it can just put like a shoe in there the shortcut I see any meat
[5169.28s -> 5181.80s]  anywhere I don't see anything that guy on floor yeah I don't think I can move
[5181.80s -> 5207.28s]  them I can't move them go down here mate he has no head okay this looks like an
[5207.28s -> 5225.12s]  elaborate scheme sewing kit oh grind up the pigs hopefully there's not a timer
[5225.16s -> 5242.85s]  okay let's grind up some pigs grab a brick to throw bricks at the pig and
[5242.85s -> 5265.61s]  knock them down somebody said this is a Zelda minigame yeah it is a carnival how
[5265.61s -> 5273.84s]  many more out of how many people do all right this is getting a little full I
[5273.84s -> 5294.15s]  think there's one more you have to eat it I do it oh I got it enter the freezer
[5294.15s -> 5309.48s]  for my molotovs I don't feel safe without the ball tops dude I love this
[5309.48s -> 5316.66s]  event it's Saucon okay very very important question does Saucon have
[5316.66s -> 5331.54s]  more than 500 attendees I don't think so that answer is no I don't think so
[5331.54s -> 5359.50s]  probably not I don't think it would god oh god no this is the end of the movie
[5359.86s -> 5374.14s]  this is gonna be absolute hell this has to move forward this is before this is
[5374.14s -> 5392.45s]  back right back it up shit let's go forward this is to go get enough room
[5392.45s -> 5421.42s]  to move this I have to move this one forward pull back no pull it back you
[5421.42s -> 5434.00s]  idiot use of Molotov good idea all right I should be bad I should be fine for a
[5434.08s -> 5453.21s]  minute I can't even see anything this default Photoshop fucking hair a brush
[5453.21s -> 5476.88s]  thing is I can't see just do it again so I'm not even doing this right throw
[5476.88s -> 5494.54s]  them all tough please how the hell you supposed to do anything like this this
[5494.54s -> 5499.16s]  is like getting up in the morning when I was living in Massachusetts if you go to
[5499.16s -> 5503.56s]  your car and you clear your car with snow and just looks like this you turn
[5503.56s -> 5506.96s]  the car on you to sit in the fucking driver's seat and this is the view you
[5506.96s -> 5514.10s]  get no I guess I'll make sure to plan an extra 35 minutes before I can drive the
[5514.10s -> 5528.64s]  car this is ridiculous I mean what point do you just I die do I not die I could
[5528.64s -> 5538.36s]  just a little bit I could see out that this is gonna be really really annoying
[5538.36s -> 5552.31s]  this is gonna suck you know that traffic game those of you that don't didn't see
[5552.31s -> 5557.13s]  the last stream of this game months ago it's that traffic game where you have to
[5557.17s -> 5561.93s]  move move move move and then get the one car to the left all the way over it's
[5561.93s -> 5576.69s]  a cult gridlock yeah yeah yeah it's stupid all the rush hour yeah all right
[5576.69s -> 5585.82s]  I'm gonna we gotta go from the back let him monologue for a second it's okay so
[5585.82s -> 5592.55s]  this one's got to move to the right so if this has got to move up to move this
[5592.55s -> 5599.35s]  one up this one has to move up move that one up these two need to move all the
[5599.39s -> 5606.92s]  way over this needs to move all the way over so to do that this needs to move up
[5606.92s -> 5644.16s]  this we mean this is right I have to move that good this thing has to get the
[5644.16s -> 5663.16s]  hell out of the way this moves all the way over this reason why you can't just
[5663.16s -> 5678.49s]  push and hold dude you can't just push and hold come on hurry up I almost got
[5678.49s -> 5696.54s]  it go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go push it fucking hurry
[5696.54s -> 5718.24s]  I'm trying fucking hurry I'm hurrying come on come on that's it that's it go
[5718.24s -> 5731.46s]  go go go go go go go go okay get in oh to the heat why are you guys doing
[5731.46s -> 5734.34s]  question you guys are question marking me in the beginning that's the only way
[5734.34s -> 5752.62s]  I was gonna be able to move them all I gotta go he sounds drunk I guess he's
[5752.62s -> 5756.94s]  probably just been sitting there drinking whiskey what if he just like
[5756.94s -> 5765.15s]  falls asleep I can just walk through all the traps it's been in-game in-universe
[5765.15s -> 5774.67s]  it's been probably like seven hours in here this dude's probably blasted this
[5774.67s -> 5786.35s]  way Julie falls asleep I got one I gotta get number two number two is in the
[5786.35s -> 5810.37s]  staff housing room now where the hell is that the freezer my lighter back staff
[5810.37s -> 5827.86s]  room effectively you see a circle none of these are even marked yeah the dude is
[5827.86s -> 5838.94s]  sloshed
[5859.03s -> 5886.00s]  oh I got a gas trap does that sound I feel like the staff room was back here
[5886.00s -> 5890.00s]  all the way back here guys I thought that was like 30 minutes left of this
[5890.16s -> 5893.84s]  game there's like two and a half hours left actually I would blame the first
[5893.84s -> 5900.60s]  hour of this transitioning to here on on the stupid puzzle thing that I got stuck
[5900.60s -> 5905.37s]  on the seven and a half minute room seven minutes room like on the wrong way
[5905.37s -> 5927.26s]  look for the staff room oh don't kill me I feel the same way when I
[5927.30s -> 5948.05s]  laugh at the streamer all right staff room what does it say
[5948.05s -> 5952.87s]  cafeteria is that way security is that way I think we have to go all the way
[5952.87s -> 5983.66s]  back staff housing I was right I was right yeah check point yeah oh shit
[5983.66s -> 6009.05s]  before I had to kind of explode pretty good I'm utilizing the traps we're going
[6009.09s -> 6018.84s]  to touch it you know the sound that it makes when you take a picture with a
[6018.84s -> 6026.37s]  disposable flash camera that's what that is that's an industry secret want to let
[6026.37s -> 6037.38s]  you guys in on it that didn't do it that time but you don't know what it goes you
[6037.38s -> 6050.62s]  guys know the one to the left and the right down each path is the light what's
[6050.62s -> 6054.98s]  your name and the light no put your faith in the light it's a name how would
[6054.98s -> 6064.22s]  that matter they can't put your name in the light I can't see what jigsaw chest
[6064.22s -> 6091.71s]  it's open it a strap and ammonia I even open those fucking useless didn't know
[6091.71s -> 6097.63s]  anything about saw to saw to as much as of a train wreck as this game is
[6097.63s -> 6122.88s]  actually yes I'm hungry oh man what are we doing food today boys and girls what
[6122.88s -> 6138.53s]  we do for food Taco Bell now I don't like boys I need a fucking circuit box

[6141.33s -> 6165.23s]  there we are hmm on this puzzle in the games
[6165.23s -> 6197.85s]  that wasn't too bad my big lane red lobster no I'd rather be able to hold in
[6197.85s -> 6201.49s]  whatever it goes down and not have it come up immediately about 30 minutes
[6201.49s -> 6220.41s]  later I say that my opinion so I feel that's my personal opinion on the
[6220.41s -> 6244.20s]  matter go to go to a restaurant and order bread for food just get bread just
[6244.20s -> 6248.32s]  eat bread for the fucking appetizer for the main course desserts eat the bread
[6248.32s -> 6258.99s]  eat cheddar biscuit bread I don't even order the lobster why would you just eat
[6258.99s -> 6276.75s]  the ethos oh those cheddar biscuits oh no it's not armed what kind of glass why
[6277.23s -> 6296.42s]  what those cheddar biscuits though right you shake don't tell anybody
[6296.42s -> 6301.52s]  sometimes go to red lobster and I order those cheddar biscuits all the cheddar
[6301.52s -> 6305.93s]  biscuits I get them and I like to I look yeah can we get two of these they put
[6305.93s -> 6309.93s]  more but they bring more of an I put like two in my pocket this so good I eat
[6309.93s -> 6317.97s]  them later on I get all you don't nobody does that stop pretending you do that
[6317.97s -> 6325.46s]  why do people have to pretend to like food just eat it who cares I know it's
[6325.46s -> 6327.94s]  good it's probably good just eat it you don't have to like pretend like it's
[6327.94s -> 6352.12s]  cool god what's so much different than everybody else we're quirky I can't say
[6352.12s -> 6365.70s]  that word people get really pissed off when I say that word hey what's a food
[6365.70s -> 6371.43s]  brag that you guys have that's what I'm referring to I'm trying to think if
