[3.45s -> 14.28s]  Hey, what's up? What's going on? We said that the sponsors were still in the description.
[14.28s -> 29.06s]  Yeah, well, whatever. That's fine. I fixed it. It's all right. Stop. What? It's a free ad.
[31.19s -> 39.05s]  No, I mean, look. Hey, they supported that show. Okay. I'm fine with that. I don't care.
[39.69s -> 53.18s]  You got a mustache? What do you think? Do you think it's still there? What do you think? Should
[53.18s -> 73.56s]  we do another vote? Hmm. We could. Yeah, I mean, you can't if you guys want to bet on this. You
[73.56s -> 80.49s]  absolutely can. I just want to let you know that I have this is on you. If you bet and you lose and
[80.49s -> 85.37s]  you lose all your channel points. I'm that's not on me that you decided to do that. You don't have.
[85.37s -> 90.87s]  I would not bet on this if I this is it could be anything. This is actually just flipping a coin
[90.87s -> 101.19s]  in the air. You have no idea. I just do a regular poll. Don't need to do a bet. Well, there it is.
[102.54s -> 110.78s]  All right. Is it there? Oh, okay. I have nothing to do with this. I'm just saying if you get mad
[110.78s -> 116.14s]  at me after this, if I open up the chat over here and I look over and I'm like, dude, what the fuck?
[116.14s -> 121.66s]  Like you fucking scammed me out of my point. No, I didn't do anything. This is I'm not telling you
[121.66s -> 139.34s]  to do this. I'm gonna say this is easy points. How would you know? You wouldn't really know
[139.34s -> 155.51s]  that it was easy because you don't know if it's there. Are you Kappa in right now? I'm not going
[155.51s -> 159.67s]  to tell you anything because the voter the poll is still up, so I'm not going to say anything to
[159.67s -> 181.30s]  you. We get some more gif emotes as sub emotes. I'm the worst streamer on Twitch in regards to
[181.30s -> 189.83s]  this kind of stuff. I just I don't know emotes and new things. There hasn't been a new sub emote.
[190.47s -> 199.43s]  I think I have like 100 slots and like 24 of them are taken up right now. Maybe I just I don't know.
[199.83s -> 209.56s]  But what would they even be? You know, okay, here's the thing about emotes and emote slots.
[210.20s -> 217.94s]  I don't know if I had this opinion years ago. Leather jacket. I fucking clicked on the button
[217.94s -> 224.39s]  to start a prediction and it blue screened my computer. Okay, well, wait, is it over?
[225.61s -> 230.38s]  All right, hold on. Hold that thought. Hold that thought. Is it still there?
[232.68s -> 244.39s]  All right, is the voting closed? Okay, here we go. Are you guys ready?
[245.88s -> 261.96s]  Oh, is it still there? Oh, God, is it still there? No. Sorry, everybody, if you voted
[261.96s -> 271.11s]  that it is there. It's not there anymore. It was it got it was so gross. I had to get rid of it.
[271.11s -> 277.54s]  I'm sorry. It was just it was causing me physical pain. I know people said, dude,
[277.54s -> 292.52s]  you have to trim it. I'm not a facial hair person. I'm not. It looked good. No, it looked good on a
[292.52s -> 297.82s]  fucking webcam through the internet, which you guys don't understand. I have to make this very
[297.82s -> 305.61s]  clear to anybody watching this stream. The amount of pixels that exist on any type of webcam or
[305.61s -> 311.93s]  camera or anything, even just this right here. You're not seeing a clear picture of my face.
[311.93s -> 317.13s]  You're seeing a kind of clear picture. It's good enough. It's 480p or 720 or something that's
[317.13s -> 323.10s]  scaled down or scaled up. But the issue is you don't really this blends together a lot.
[323.10s -> 327.90s]  For instance, huge zit. You probably didn't even notice. Maybe you did notice that. But let me tell
[327.90s -> 333.35s]  you something in real life. Like if I go in the mirror and I lean in, it's it's ghastly. It's
[333.35s -> 339.64s]  ghastly. But you just can't see that. You can kind of tell that there's something there. But if I when
[339.64s -> 345.00s]  I had that mustache and when it's blurring and blending together from the webcam, it looks fine.
[345.00s -> 351.35s]  But when I lean in and I'm looking in the mirror and I got a light on, I look like a scarecrow. I
[351.35s -> 357.86s]  look like the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz. It's just like it's just these spines that they
[357.86s -> 368.31s]  just point in random directions. It looks bad. I mean, it's ghastly. It is. Dude, you look normal.
[368.31s -> 381.90s]  Yeah. You didn't even do a full shave. It's still there. Yes, I, I, yeah. But dude, okay. It's been,
[382.46s -> 396.86s]  when was the last time I streamed? Three days ago? Two days ago? You look like you got smoothed out
[396.86s -> 414.94s]  by a clothing iron. That's a really specific compliment and insult together. I know exactly
[414.94s -> 422.74s]  what you mean. And that's funny. But anyways, yeah. Okay. So when I shaved two days ago, three days
[422.74s -> 431.30s]  ago, this is what just happens when it grows back. Smoothed out by a clothing iron. Tiny face cam.
[431.30s -> 435.99s]  It's not tiny. It's a, it's a perfectly normal size. All right. So here's the deal. Here's what's
[435.99s -> 443.69s]  going on. Let me explain a few things. Ah, you're a grease ball. My hair is wet. I took a shower and
[443.69s -> 447.37s]  it's going to dry in an hour. And you're going to be like, whoa, what does your hair look like?
[447.37s -> 451.29s]  Why does your hair look like shit today? It's because it's just wet and then it just dries.
[451.29s -> 460.17s]  I didn't put any product in my hair. I'm going to turn this way and it's going to be like this big
[460.17s -> 464.54s]  poof. And people are going to get a screenshot. Like zoom in right there. See his hairline is
[464.54s -> 472.58s]  going back. Do you see? Yeah, it is good. I can't wait to be ugly. Can I tell you? I can't wait till
[472.58s -> 479.08s]  I'm a gross old man just sitting there like, like skin sagging down like to here. I can't wait till
[479.08s -> 491.77s]  I'm fucking gross and old. Cause I'll tell you, well, let me, when you cross like 30, like 35,
[491.77s -> 499.13s]  yeah, I, you kind of don't really care that much about, oh my, I say when I turned 30 on my 30th
[499.13s -> 506.57s]  birthday, uh, I noticed that I had some thinning hair and I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[506.57s -> 512.41s]  it can't be. No, not yet. I'm 30. No, no, no. Maybe if I can individually give each one of these
[512.41s -> 517.37s]  vitamins, dude, I would put olive oil in my hair, olive oil and tea tree oil. I would do like this
[517.37s -> 522.39s]  slurry and I would put it all in my head. I would put olive oil all over my head back when I was
[522.39s -> 528.71s]  30, 31. I was terrified of losing my hair. I was like, no, I can't, I can't, I can't go. Uh, so I
[528.79s -> 533.37s]  just, you know, read all these concoctions and, oh, you know, like tea tree oil stimulates hair
[533.37s -> 541.06s]  growth. I started drinking a lot of, uh, you know, a lot more water, a lot of green tea. Uh, and
[541.06s -> 550.01s]  I mean, at some point I kind of just gave up on that. I didn't really care anymore. So, uh, after
[550.01s -> 557.18s]  like 35, I'll tell you, if you're concerned about kind of your hair, if you're a guy and you're
[557.18s -> 564.78s]  concerned about hair loss, you go from this mode of, oh, this can't be happening to me. At some
[564.78s -> 569.34s]  point in, in your, in your twenties or your late twenties, early thirties, whatever it is, whenever
[569.34s -> 575.59s]  it starts to thin. And then you kind of just go, you know what? People age. Who cares? People age.
[575.59s -> 582.71s]  That's what happens when you turn 30, 40, 50. You age. Who cares? That's fine. I don't have a problem
[582.71s -> 591.59s]  with it anymore. How come you do the lamest shit when you get back from an event? I mean, like
[591.59s -> 601.93s]  Pac-Man? What are you talking about? Pac-Man world is, is lame. I, I mean, I guess that's your, you
[601.93s -> 614.38s]  know. This is my first what? You don't like Pac-Man world? Well, I'll tell you, Chatter. This was voted
[614.38s -> 628.33s]  on before the stream started. This was voted on by a bunch of your peers. So, um, you got other people
[628.33s -> 646.31s]  to be upset with. Your classmates, yeah. Dude, the olive oil. What'd you say? Dude, do baseball. It's way
[646.31s -> 656.39s]  cooler. Dude, I should just do another baseball stream. I actually like want to. So bad. I so badly
[656.39s -> 661.96s]  want to do that again. But it, you know, whatever. You move on. The next one. But anyways, we're going
[661.96s -> 666.97s]  to play Pac-Man world. What was I just talking about? It was something I was going to bring up
[666.97s -> 675.99s]  and I don't remember what it was. What the hell were we just talking about? No, before hair. Before
[675.99s -> 692.31s]  the hair loss thing. It was after mustache and before hair. Being old. No, that was part of the
[692.31s -> 700.33s]  hair. Eh, sorry. All right, I got a controller here. This is Pac-Man world. Oops. Being old?
[700.33s -> 709.13s]  Showering. I don't remember. Who cares? Does it really matter at this point? Camera. Yeah, we're
[709.13s -> 715.02s]  going to play Cult of the Lamb. That was on the poll. I'm telling you, you had. This is very. Why
[715.02s -> 723.42s]  is this so loud? Yeah. Cult of the Lamb and Sorcery Part 3 are going to be this week as well
[723.98s -> 733.64s]  as something else that I will be participating in. Um, I don't want to like announce it before
[733.64s -> 762.41s]  somebody else does. Maybe let me ask. Let me see if I can just announce it. But maybe I shouldn't.
[762.41s -> 769.29s]  Oh, fuck. I already said it, didn't I? I already did say it. That's right. I said it in the pre-stream
[769.29s -> 781.91s]  chat. Oh, oh, whatever. If I get confirmation, I'll formally announce it. Leak Andy. No, not
[781.91s -> 789.99s]  Leak Andy. All right, I'm ready. We're going to play Pac-Man world. The lamest thing I've done
[789.99s -> 801.75s]  since baseball. So let's go ahead and go. Start with English. OK, yes. Um, I have to be really
[801.75s -> 808.20s]  honest. I've put up this facade for a very long time and I'm like coming to terms with it right
[808.20s -> 815.42s]  now. I don't care about Pac-Man at all. Like I don't really like, oh, here we go. Pac-Man world.
[815.42s -> 821.27s]  Everyone, let's go. All the Pac-Man music. I kind of like don't care about any. Like I'm sitting here
[821.27s -> 827.03s]  going, oh, man, let's get hype for Pac-Man. It's a Pac-Man party. I mean, I think Pac-Man is cool,
[827.03s -> 834.52s]  but do I think he's this cool? I don't think so. All right, let's turn it up. Got seen. I mean,
[834.52s -> 839.56s]  he's cool. I do. Have I been pretending that I have to play every Pac-Man game that comes out?
[845.90s -> 864.52s]  Pac-Man made you. Now that's fair. Who is this? Who is Pac-Man?
[876.36s -> 881.48s]  Pac-Man's naked. Doesn't have like Spongebob pants on. Why is it weird for me to look at right now?
[881.48s -> 885.00s]  Isn't that weird? Something's weird about this. What is it? Why is it so different?
[885.00s -> 897.61s]  I don't know.
[897.61s -> 920.12s]  Pac-Mom. Doesn't he have pants on in Smash Brothers? Hold on. Whoa, this is actually 3D.
[920.12s -> 925.00s]  Oh, God, this is 3D. All right, hold on. Probably just got cut off. Wait, hold on. What does he look
[925.00s -> 940.65s]  like in Smash Brothers? Pac-Man Smash Brothers. Yeah, he does have. Yeah, that's right. I guess
[940.65s -> 947.88s]  I'm just, I just don't remember. I don't know why this is so weird for me to look at right now.
[947.88s -> 956.07s]  Okay, I'm back. All right, welcome to Pac-Man world. Over there is the ghost area. Watch out
[956.07s -> 962.31s]  for ghosts and eat all the Pac-Dots. The big dots are power pellets. Eat them to power up Pac-Man
[962.31s -> 968.17s]  and get the ghosts. Don't get careless. Power pellet effects wear off after a while. Yeah, I've played
[973.46s -> 978.71s]  fake fan. All right. Oh, wait a minute. This is actually pretty sick.
[979.43s -> 1001.82s]  Wait, you can break stuff? What does B? How long does this last? All right, cool. Very cool. Oh,
[1001.82s -> 1012.26s]  Pac-Coins. This is a slot metal. Hang on to it and you'll be glad you did later. Wait, you can
[1012.26s -> 1021.78s]  throw shit? Wait, you can throw grenades. All right, cool. What does it want to do? Be careful,
[1021.78s -> 1028.26s]  Pac-Man. There are a lot of enemies up ahead. Try taking them out with the button dots. Okay.
[1028.26s -> 1032.98s]  Do you have any Pac-Dots? You can press B to perform a Pac-Dot attack. You have lots of dots
[1032.98s -> 1043.62s]  hold to charge a bomb attack. Is there a lock on? All right, that's pretty fun. How do you open chests?
[1044.10s -> 1056.63s]  What was that? Wait, this is like a Yoshi thing. Go back, go back, go back. Oh, did I miss something?
[1056.63s -> 1068.86s]  I mean, I'm 100%ing the game, so I feel you. What did I miss? No, did I miss something?
[1069.42s -> 1078.73s]  I already said Dollar General Andy. What does that mean? There's bananas up there. Oh,
[1078.73s -> 1089.02s]  there are bananas in the trees. You're right. Cool. All right, let's go. Oh, that's how you...
[1089.02s -> 1096.12s]  Ah, all right. So, that's what I'm missing. Cool. Oh, my God. It's been so... I've been waiting this
[1096.12s -> 1103.08s]  game for like 10 years. I'm going to really cherish it. I press A to float to the surface.
[1110.31s -> 1122.09s]  All right. How do I get down there? Oh, you can just float. So, if you're not a big Pac-Man fan,
[1123.05s -> 1129.77s]  that's fine. This is a remake of an old game for a big PlayStation. Pac-Man World, I believe,
[1129.77s -> 1138.25s]  was 1998? Scream already. I've screamed twice in 10 minutes of the stream starting. All right,
[1138.25s -> 1142.17s]  ban that guy for as long as it takes for them to understand what they did wrong,
[1142.89s -> 1150.47s]  which is probably two minutes. Okay, press them with a butt bounce. The green switch
[1150.47s -> 1160.09s]  only works one time. What does it do? Oh, all right. This is cute. What's wrong with this?
[1160.09s -> 1167.62s]  This is cute. This is a cute game. This is way better than Glover. I'll tell you,
[1167.62s -> 1173.30s]  factually. What matter of absolute fact? This is way better than Glover. A hundred times better.
[1175.38s -> 1179.38s]  And I love Glover. Glover is like one of my favorite N64 games.
[1180.26s -> 1183.96s]  Okay, when the switches effect wears off, this one only lasts a certain amount of time.
[1190.81s -> 1195.78s]  Just testing. That's a trampoline. Aim at the center with a butt bounce and bounce into the
[1195.78s -> 1208.58s]  air. But not before I go get the sneakers. Okay. Cool. All right. How do I get? Oh,
[1208.58s -> 1215.90s]  you can do a Sonic the Hedgehog bounce. Cool. Is this game hard or is this for actual kids?
[1219.14s -> 1224.92s]  Jump at the water surface to do a dolphin jump. Use it to get items above the water. Yep. Butt
[1224.92s -> 1229.24s]  bouncing. Treasure chest in the water. Needs something to do that though. All right. That's
[1229.24s -> 1238.58s]  fine. What's in here? Metal dot from the treasure chest. Metal dots allow you to walk underwater
[1238.58s -> 1249.78s]  while you're metallic. You're invulnerable. What's that? What's a goal? What's the actual goal of
[1249.78s -> 1261.06s]  this game? Is it like Banjo Kazooie? Is it kind of like Mario? Do I have to collect stuff? I think
[1261.06s -> 1267.24s]  I'm going to beat this game like in the next three hours. I think I'm going for it. Okay.
[1267.24s -> 1273.16s]  You've reached the checkpoint. Yep. Start over. Have you tried the rev roll? Hold Y and let go.
[1274.12s -> 1287.75s]  You can climb steep hills by using a rev roll. Really? Don't. I'm gonna. You can take those
[1287.75s -> 1296.14s]  enemies by hitting them with the rev roll. That's actually kind of fun. Oh, this game is pretty fun.
[1298.55s -> 1313.18s]  Okay. That's a elevator. Hit on a press Y to open the gate in front. Did I miss anything?
[1319.99s -> 1323.51s]  Look out. You can fall from here. Hold X while jumping to hang in midair. Try it if you're about
[1323.51s -> 1337.93s]  to fall. Okay. Easy enough. What's that? Oh! All right. What's this mean? What does it say? Two?
[1339.16s -> 1354.14s]  What does that say? Is that a two? Did I miss something? Blue switches are the strangest
[1354.14s -> 1360.49s]  switches. Pressing one lets you press two. Okay. Go back and. Okay. That's what it means. I get it.
[1361.21s -> 1369.88s]  This game looks pretty decent so far. Yeah. It actually kind of does. All right. Fuck all that.
[1377.29s -> 1386.58s]  What? What just happened? Okay. Cool. All right. What does that thing do? Is that just a button?
[1394.06s -> 1399.50s]  This is a fruit door. There are switches, bonus letters, and other things to find on the other
[1399.50s -> 1404.46s]  side. Sometimes there are even keys to rescue your friends with. Open all the fruit doors to
[1404.46s -> 1411.16s]  rescue your friends. How do you open the fruit door? I need an apple? How do I get an apple?
[1411.16s -> 1418.49s]  Pressing the yellow switch will cause DOS or power pills to appear. Oh, there we go. All right.
[1418.49s -> 1434.98s]  Do I have? Oh, that's what I got with my inventory. Cool. Let's go. The ghost boss
[1435.70s -> 1442.18s]  Hawkman statue is up ahead. See if you can smash it. I don't. Oh, I missed the thing with
[1442.18s -> 1454.68s]  top. I didn't think it was going to do that. Oh yeah. Here we go. Let's do it. Slot bonus.
[1455.40s -> 1471.64s]  So how do I bet? Okay. I got three coins. Do I have to stop it? Is this an? Is this a? All right.
[1471.64s -> 1476.44s]  We're looking for a banana. Banana. Stop. What are you doing? That wasn't a banana.
[1477.00s -> 1490.60s]  That was not even close. That was a lemon. Idiot. Banana. Stop. Do it again. Okay. So you need to do
[1490.60s -> 1498.42s]  two, one or two before. So where's the orange? Orange. Okay. It's banana. Orange. But what's
[1498.42s -> 1505.43s]  before banana? Cherry. Okay. Cherry. Stop on cherry. What are you talking about? I have no idea
[1505.43s -> 1515.38s]  what's going on. Can you read? I mean, can I read? All right. Peach.
[1515.38s -> 1563.10s]  I just made a million dollars. What did I just get? No miss. 10,000. One 10,000 one up.
[1565.42s -> 1577.69s]  All right. Cool. That's a good start. Corsairs Cove episode unlocked. Oh cool. I think should
[1577.69s -> 1581.21s]  two headphones go in for this? Oh man. That's actually kind of fun. I'm kind of excited. I'm
[1581.21s -> 1589.02s]  kind of excited. Pirate ship area. Choose your destination. All right. I guess I'm just going
[1589.02s -> 1612.63s]  to do this. All right. What's this? What is this thing? View movies in credits. Oh, we didn't watch
[1612.63s -> 1626.07s]  this. Oh, we got to watch this. We have to see what happens. Happy birthday. Whose birthday is it?
[1626.07s -> 1638.07s]  Oh my God. That looks good. If we wouldn't see them up there.
[1640.50s -> 1659.99s]  Pac-Man, just pick up a rock and throw it up there. Who's the dog? Is this a Pac-Man dog?
[1664.90s -> 1681.70s]  What? So wait, Pac-Man has to eat a pellet for a ghost to get hurt. What is that? What are the
[1681.70s -> 1685.86s]  rules there though? Like if I eat a power pellet and I throw a rock at a ghost, will it hit? Will
[1685.86s -> 1700.04s]  it hurt them? Do I have to physically bite them? Well, that doesn't make any sense because they
[1700.04s -> 1705.91s]  just pick, they just pick that guy up. There's obviously physical stuff going on. They're able
[1705.91s -> 1714.49s]  to touch and pick up things in the world. So you're telling me if I threw that, if I,
[1714.49s -> 1719.13s]  if I smash that glass pitcher over a ghost head, that it's going to go through them. That doesn't
[1719.13s -> 1743.45s]  make any sense. You're a fake fan. I'm just kidding around. I'm just messing around. I'm
[1743.45s -> 1746.57s]  just kidding around. I'm just messing around. I'm just messing around. I'm kidding. I'm just
[1746.57s -> 1759.18s]  messing around. Okay. But what if one of the ghosts, okay, what if, hold on, I actually have
[1759.18s -> 1764.26s]  a question. So the ghost, when Pac-Man eats a pellet, he turns into the Pac-Man thing. You
[1764.26s -> 1769.70s]  can eat the ghost turn blue. Could, could a ghost get like struck by lightning and die?
[1773.50s -> 1778.06s]  Like, could a ghost get like an anvil dropped on their head and die if it had nothing to do
[1778.06s -> 1794.25s]  with like a Pac-Man pellet? They already did that. All right, let's go. I'm ready. There's one.
[1794.89s -> 1813.11s]  Can you drown? I need a, I need a metal Mario. Is there a metal thing here?
[1815.62s -> 1841.82s]  Shit. Lemon. All right, let me up. All right, let's blow through this. Oh, what? Oh, cause they're
[1841.82s -> 1861.05s]  ghosts. Okay. Well, that fucks my whole logic up. Wait. Oh my goodness. All right. I got it.
[1861.05s -> 1879.96s]  All right, let's go. You're an idiot. I'm not an idiot. I didn't know that you had to, whatever.
[1879.96s -> 1894.41s]  I didn't know those were ghosts. They were pirates. Fuck off. Wait, give me this. Is there
[1894.41s -> 1905.53s]  another metal Mario anywhere? There's right here. Hold on. How do I get up there? How did you not
[1905.53s -> 1922.68s]  know? I mean, I know, I, I know how it, how it works. I just, it's a 3d platformer. Is it not
[1922.68s -> 1940.89s]  here anymore? So I need another metal Mario thing. Is there one over here? I don't think you can
[1940.89s -> 1956.74s]  drown. I don't think so. It doesn't feel like it. Can't go that way. Wall jump. This definitely,
[1956.74s -> 1969.48s]  I probably unlock it in a minute. What about the door? Oh, you definitely can't drown. I would have
[1969.48s -> 1992.62s]  drowned already. I feel like I missed a bunch of shit. Did I? Go back, go back. That made me so
[1992.62s -> 1998.70s]  mad. Did you see it? I'm glad I have the camera on because I was actually fucking mad for one
[1998.70s -> 2003.77s]  tenth of a second. It was just like, why'd you do that? Here we go. All right, we're good.
[2004.57s -> 2029.42s]  All right, gotta be quick. Strawberry. Can I get it again? Yeah, I felt my, my face go
[2030.30s -> 2044.28s]  like this. Oh, this P for Pac-Man. Idiot. I like the sound when he walks. I think this is a cute
[2044.28s -> 2058.62s]  game. How much is this game? There it is. Is the A? I don't know, dude. You bought it. I don't,
[2058.62s -> 2071.67s]  I don't know. I don't remember. I bought it a while ago when it first came out. Still don't have that.
[2074.04s -> 2088.71s]  30 bucks. I knew it was under like 30 or 40. There it is. Dude, you were waiting at game stuff at
[2088.71s -> 2097.29s]  midnight for this. Imagine getting that phone call. This is GameStop, where you can buy and
[2097.29s -> 2101.69s]  sell used games and make sure to check out Sonic the Hedgehog. It's coming out. By the way,
[2101.69s -> 2107.42s]  can I get an interview and pre-ordering Sonic the Hedgehog? No, thank you. When does, do you
[2107.42s -> 2117.27s]  guys do a midnight release for Pac-Man World Repack? Yeah, you betcha, man. Okay. Yeah,
[2117.27s -> 2120.55s]  should I write your name down as literally the only fucking person that's going to be here?
[2121.35s -> 2142.63s]  Yeah. Okay. Ooh, nice, nice, nice. Give me it. And then at midnight, I just don't go.
[2143.59s -> 2152.79s]  It's like, no, that's actually, I don't like, that's dumb. Don't they usually do the midnight
[2152.79s -> 2160.98s]  releases for different, you know, at the same time? Like it'd be, oh, you, but you can get
[2160.98s -> 2172.65s]  Pac-Man World Repack or The Witcher 3, right? Don't they usually do that? I need to see. Yeah,
[2172.65s -> 2181.94s]  where is it? I'm looking, I'm like looking at chat. I'm not looking. Yeah, guys, I might be
[2181.94s -> 2188.68s]  going like moving the character, but I'm, I'm reading what you're saying. Stop reading chat.
[2189.40s -> 2194.06s]  No, I will never stop reading chat. I will never stop picking up the one person here
[2194.06s -> 2199.10s]  that says that my hair looks like a mustache or that it looks like my room smells like fucking
[2200.22s -> 2205.05s]  pee, but I'm not going to, I'm going to always read this. Like, Hey dude, it looks like your
[2205.05s -> 2208.41s]  room smells like pee. I'm going to read, I'm going to read that. So like, I'm going to all be,
[2208.41s -> 2224.47s]  I'm going to be looking over here all the time. Where is it? Where is it? You guys told me I
[2224.47s -> 2233.70s]  missed it. Where? Get the C. I don't, I don't, there's no C here. Where is it? What letter is
[2233.70s -> 2256.90s]  that? Oh, how do I get that? Where's the C? Did you actually see it somewhere? Do I have that item?
[2256.90s -> 2267.51s]  How do I look? I want whatever that is. Did you guys actually see the C? I promise I'm
[2267.51s -> 2277.26s]  not being a fucking weirdo. Did anybody actually see it? No, I got to go back.
[2281.03s -> 2283.67s]  I'm going to die in this game and it's going to be embarrassing in level one.
[2283.67s -> 2307.06s]  Hmm. Oh my God. I just got so much. Now what? I can open the door down here. What is this?
[2309.74s -> 2320.62s]  You got a maze. Oh, okay. I've got to get everything. If I don't get every single one
[2320.62s -> 2395.64s]  of these out, delete my Twitch channel. You have to stick around. That was actually really close.
[2396.52s -> 2403.53s]  That was way too close. I was very uncomfortable. I know it's a joke, right? But I was uncomfortable
[2403.53s -> 2425.59s]  that whole time. I was, I was, I was not doing okay. Okay. You would have done it. No, I would
[2425.59s -> 2431.83s]  have found some dumb way to say, oh, well, I'll delete my Twitch channel in, you know, eventually
[2431.83s -> 2441.35s]  in 10 years. Or I would have said something dumb. Don't worry. I have really all that did.
[2442.71s -> 2452.84s]  Where? I honestly, guys, where's the C? I'm going to, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it,
[2452.84s -> 2469.54s]  right? Oh, wait, careful. Those are metal enemies. Oh, there it is. Perfect. Wait,
[2469.54s -> 2483.18s]  I don't have that. Sit. There we go. I'm going to be able to do a lot of slot machine stuff later.
[2483.82s -> 2509.45s]  All right. Sneed the end. I thought I just got hurt. Change the music. Uh, guys, I'm sorry. I
[2509.45s -> 2515.62s]  cannot, I can't just turn on a different OST. This is what the game soundtrack is. And it's
[2515.62s -> 2521.94s]  cute. It's fine. You can't just put on blocked OST for every single game I play.
[2524.49s -> 2533.21s]  Give me, come on, give me some slack. All right. I got all, I got Pac-Man.
[2536.10s -> 2544.76s]  I thought I had to go in there from the bell or something at the end.
[2546.36s -> 2552.17s]  Oh my goodness. There's a lot of shit back here. Uh, let me get, hold on,
[2552.17s -> 2583.75s]  don't get too far ahead. No, not yet. Can't jump this. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What's that?
[2584.39s -> 2595.21s]  Ooh, a key. Why would you want to change this music?
[2596.86s -> 2606.30s]  Pac-Man music. Doesn't everybody universally love, whatever. I thought everybody universally loved
[2606.30s -> 2643.88s]  Pac-Man music. Ooh, wait, I'm going to do this. Yep. Oh, wait. Bonus stage. That was a fake
[2643.88s -> 2670.47s]  reaction, but whatever. I'll take it. Bonus stage. Oh, okay. I got it. Oh, I can't get it.
[2682.87s -> 2704.49s]  Got them all. What do I do here? I got five spins. This is going to be huge. All right.
[2705.05s -> 2722.09s]  Can I max bet? Can I bet everything I have in one spin? Yep. I got to try to get the, uh, the
[2722.65s -> 2737.80s]  spaceship. Where's the spaceship? Okay. It's one, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three,
[2737.88s -> 2751.10s]  four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six, six, four,
[2751.10s -> 2757.58s]  one, two, three. How did I do that? How did I mess that up? How is that possible? I don't know
[2757.58s -> 2769.46s]  what happened. That's fucked up. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five,
[2769.46s -> 2799.11s]  six. That's okay. What a dork. Give it. Let's do it. I'll get it this time. Ready? One, two,
[2799.19s -> 2808.39s]  three, four, five, six. One, two, three. This music beat is fucking me up. One, two, three, four,
[2808.39s -> 2814.63s]  five, six. One, two, three. Why is my voice getting deeper? What's that? Whoa. What the
[2814.63s -> 2818.95s]  fuck is going on? No, I was like going, I was getting, I was, I was, what the fuck kind of gas
[2818.95s -> 2844.73s]  was I just inhaling? Two, one, two, three. Oh my God. Whatever. I got, I won once. I'm fine.
[2845.88s -> 2857.48s]  I have 14 extra lives guys. Sorry. 18. I have 18 lives. I don't think I'm going to use more
[2857.48s -> 2883.37s]  than two of these. So don't worry. Crazy cannonade. I almost have the area one boss. When are you
[2883.37s -> 2892.76s]  going to finally play Eve Online? Um, isn't that the game where sometimes it takes like five years
[2893.40s -> 2899.54s]  for there to be real like geopolitical fights and stuff. And after like a half decade,
[2899.54s -> 2906.57s]  there's like a battle and you just lose everything. That's that game is intense.
[2908.74s -> 2915.53s]  You want to talk about a roguelike. One run could take four or five years.
[2915.53s -> 2925.86s]  That's a really cool concept for a game. I will say, but I just, I'm, I'm way too impatient for it.
[2927.53s -> 2942.34s]  You didn't think I was going to get up here, did you? It just excels spreadsheets in an MMO.
[2945.90s -> 2951.67s]  Wasn't there something that happened? Uh, not that long ago. It was like the biggest Eve Online
[2951.67s -> 2957.11s]  fight ever in history. It was like thousands of people. It was like the ultimate, it was like
[2957.11s -> 2971.06s]  the infinity war. When was the Eve Online end game? It was pretty recently, wasn't it? Five
[2971.06s -> 2978.90s]  years ago. It was the fountain war. Why are people batch testing? Oh, it's because I said, I said
[2978.90s -> 2990.57s]  Marvel. Oh, I got to get up there. Did I just ruin my chance to get up there? The enemies respawn.
[2991.85s -> 3009.45s]  Come on. Did I really ruin it? I don't think I can get up there. There it is. All right, we're good.
[3019.08s -> 3036.02s]  Is that, that's not the fruit I need. I need an apple. The Eve Online big battle nearly cost
[3036.02s -> 3061.29s]  $400,000 in damages. Oh my God. That's crazy. Oh, okay. $400,000. I would be so scared to play that
[3061.29s -> 3073.90s]  kind of game. And whenever I play an MMO, I always want to hold onto every single thing I've ever
[3073.90s -> 3092.01s]  collected. So thinking and knowing that I could, you could lose a half of a decade of progress
[3092.01s -> 3098.25s]  and you just spawn and that guy stole it over there. Part of that group or that team, whatever.
[3098.89s -> 3129.06s]  Hold on now. That's the first time that's been possible. It looks like Mario 3D world. It says
[3129.06s -> 3144.25s]  Pac-Man world repack. Wait, what am I doing? Why can I hit the back wall? The wall, that's the
[3145.05s -> 3152.76s]  the art in the background. How is that possible? Why can I hit the background art?
[3160.17s -> 3184.26s]  Hold on. Let's go. I thought I could move it.
[3186.42s -> 3197.18s]  I thought I could move it as the big easy mode. Oh my God. What is easy mode?
[3197.18s -> 3208.55s]  I'm getting, I'm getting Luigi right now. What is that? No, no, you can hang for a long time in the
[3208.55s -> 3229.29s]  air. Okay. Let Luigi play. You know, I always say that I've never played that game. I just know that
[3229.29s -> 3237.06s]  that's, you know, maybe I have. No, I didn't. I hated it. That's right. That's right. I played
[3237.06s -> 3245.40s]  Super Mario 3D world and I hated every second of it. I really did. I thought it was the worst Mario
[3245.40s -> 3252.71s]  game ever. I thought it was so awful. I hated every waking moment of playing that game. I'm sorry. I
[3252.71s -> 3262.42s]  had the same conversation a couple of years ago about it. I know it's a weird opinion, but I really
[3262.42s -> 3269.77s]  did. I just, I didn't like it at all. And I always go into stuff with an open mind. I really do.
[3269.77s -> 3281.34s]  Especially a Mario game. You know, Mario Galaxy. Oh my God. Right. Mario Galaxy. Mario Sunshine.
[3281.34s -> 3289.48s]  Mario 64. I love that shit. 3D world or 3D land? What was the side scrolling one?
[3289.48s -> 3296.76s]  Oh, the side scrolling news. New Super Mario Brothers Wii. That's what I'm thinking of. No,
[3296.76s -> 3303.72s]  not 3D world. New Super Mario Brothers Wii with the two tones. That one sucks. That one sucks.
[3303.72s -> 3312.79s]  Ass. That's the one I'm thinking of. I need the A. No, not Mario Maker. I'm talking to... Oh my God.
[3319.48s -> 3328.97s]  Where's the A? I don't think, I think I can't get it. I can't go back. I can't go back.
[3330.01s -> 3349.78s]  The A is gone forever. I can't go back. Oh well. Wait. No, I can't make that. I can't go back.
[3354.26s -> 3360.84s]  Yeah. New Super Mario Brothers Wii. The one where you stuck the walls. Oh my God.
[3362.73s -> 3389.77s]  That was so bad. That's how far you can throw this? Can I aim it anywhere else? That's so bad.
[3390.57s -> 3415.94s]  Do I have the orange? Wait, that's not right. Wait a minute. This is a long one.
[3416.66s -> 3441.16s]  I think I just walked out. No. That's the M. Shit. Oh well. You can't get everything.
[3441.80s -> 3450.18s]  All right. I got to come back here because there's a bonus level. Can I climb that or anything?
[3451.06s -> 3482.98s]  Jump on his head. There it is. Okay. Made it. People play the Pac-Man games actually?
[3483.94s -> 3490.84s]  Um, yeah. I mean, I'm doing it right now. I'm here right now playing it. Wish I could have done
[3490.84s -> 3521.45s]  that before. Don't come over here. If I don't get all these, if I don't get every single one of these,
[3521.45s -> 3574.23s]  I will, I will eat my Twitch channel. You already did that joke. Yeah. Reuse joke, Andy. I guess
[3574.23s -> 3583.66s]  that I missed the A. All right. Let me ask you guys this question. What do you think is the best
[3584.76s -> 3590.92s]  Mario video game that has come out ever? And I'm talking across every platform. By the way,
[3590.92s -> 3599.37s]  there are some that are grayed out. Mario 64 is grayed out as well as Super Mario World for the
[3599.37s -> 3605.82s]  SNES. Those are both grayed out. You cannot pick those. They're grayed out. There are,
[3605.82s -> 3618.57s]  there are SS tier. You can't touch them. Odyssey. Odyssey was very, yeah. Odyssey was very good.
[3618.57s -> 3627.70s]  Honestly, it was very good. I still think it's probably Galaxy. Although Galaxy made me puke.
[3627.70s -> 3630.10s]  Well, I didn't actually throw up, but it made me feel like I was going to.
[3633.21s -> 3649.24s]  What's the wrong button? Good thing I have a lot of lives. What did I say? I was going to go through
[3650.20s -> 3662.62s]  the whole game. That was inaccurate. I need to switch that right now. Okay. In every single
[3662.62s -> 3668.86s]  video game you've ever played, is it hang in midair? Is the jump button again, but I can't
[3668.86s -> 3682.26s]  make it that right. It's usually like a, right? A, but it's a in an X. That feels weird.
[3693.37s -> 3697.61s]  God damn it. I want to hover. I don't want to fall straight down. I want to go like this,
[3697.61s -> 3727.05s]  but I have to hit the, it's not jump. What is this? Oh, okay. Let's go.
[3732.87s -> 3748.17s]  Oh my God. Get out the fucking way. No, I missed the other A.
[3760.84s -> 3787.06s]  Greedy Gary. That's me. All right. All right. Let's go. Did I miss the end? I might have.
[3790.34s -> 3793.88s]  I don't even know why this moves in the game. It's truly bad.
[3798.89s -> 3808.76s]  Lower the game volume. I'm trying to sleep. Dude, just lower the stream volume. Lower the stream
[3808.76s -> 3813.96s]  volume. You have a volume control. Hold up your, just click, click, click, click down a few times.
[3813.96s -> 3822.90s]  You can do that on your own. I don't have to do that. What, you know, what would have been really
[3822.90s -> 3828.02s]  funny is if you said, Hey, Jerma, can you turn down your screams audio? I'm too lazy to do it myself.
[3828.02s -> 3848.79s]  That would have been like, all right, that's funny. Why does it feel like I can go down there?
[3852.34s -> 3885.75s]  I don't know why. I just, I saw the sand, whatever. I spam and spamming lower your voice.
[3886.39s -> 3895.70s]  I'm watching this at full volume at my mother's funeral. That would, that would, that's very odd.
[3907.14s -> 3913.94s]  Full volume. You see, the thing is you're just going to look like a fucking lunatic, right?
[3913.94s -> 3923.66s]  That's, that's, I have nothing to do with this. Oh, it's ticked up. They're not going to think
[3923.66s -> 3927.18s]  you're watching a stream. They're going to think you're playing Pac-Man really loudly.
[3930.49s -> 3936.92s]  That's all. The only thing is that you can really decipher it. You're just going to hear like,
[3938.76s -> 3943.24s]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You're just going to be like this. Oh my God. What are you
[3943.24s -> 3964.81s]  doing? Stop swearing in front of your mom's coffin. Imagine. I can't believe this. I hit my mom's
[3964.81s -> 3971.03s]  funeral. This guy. Can you, can you believe what this guy's saying? Oh my God. I'm so bad. All
[3971.03s -> 3982.01s]  right. I'm going to try to actually get it. One and a two and a three and a four and a one and a two
[3982.01s -> 4002.55s]  and a three and a four. It's gotta be faster. This is how I can keep tempo. Six, five,
[4003.51s -> 4015.32s]  two, three, four, five, six. You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[4029.59s -> 4042.98s]  One, two, three, four, one, two, three. Start over. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, three,
[4042.98s -> 4068.39s]  four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six, whatever. I'm sweating through this shirt.
[4068.39s -> 4088.38s]  What's happening? I wonder what the bosses are like. Hey dude, can you speak up? I'm in a
[4088.38s -> 4107.26s]  construction site. Okay. This is important. Okay. I got something. Bear with me for one minute.
[4107.26s -> 4111.86s]  I'm going to try to be very straight faced about this and see if I can do it.
[4112.10s -> 4154.38s]  Oh, like this is, this is just a ton of work going on. They're building a skyscraper next to me.
[4154.38s -> 4167.64s]  This sounds pretty good. 10 hours of construction sounds. This is challenge. Watch the full video.
[4168.28s -> 4187.42s]  This is too obvious. It's gotta be way louder than me, right? Like I gotta turn myself down.
[4313.98s -> 4391.27s]  Is it fine now? Okay. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. I don't know if I can take that.
[4393.27s -> 4440.26s]  I was like, why is it still on? That was this. It's still on. We're good. Oh, it's because I,
[4440.26s -> 4459.24s]  whoops. Uh-oh. It's evil Pac-Man. Oh, I had to turn that off. This is still on.
[4463.14s -> 4479.70s]  Windbag. This will be the time for you to be able to throw a grenade, Pac-Man.
[4483.21s -> 4499.45s]  I don't get it. I mean, does it have to hit something? Did that work? Why is this audio
[4499.45s -> 4542.70s]  sound like it's a compressed YouTube video? Oh, it's firing back. What? Oh, shit. All right.
[4546.66s -> 4597.62s]  I knew it was going to get faster. Um, what? Do peach? All right. One more hit and that's it.
[4607.21s -> 4613.82s]  Got it. This is your worst stream. 10 out of 10. Sorry about the construction, dude.
[4613.82s -> 4618.44s]  I'm really sorry about the construction. Yeah, I banned that person. I banned that person for
[4618.44s -> 4621.56s]  like at least a day. I banned that person for a full day and missed everything because of that.
[4622.36s -> 4629.08s]  I want that person banned for a day, at least 24 hours. Oh my God. I missed everything.
[4629.08s -> 4632.36s]  What the fuck? That was everything. That was so much coins and shit.
[4633.00s -> 4651.02s]  Permanently banned that person. No, no, no, no, no. Permanent ban is like 10 minutes.
[4651.02s -> 4655.14s]  Saying I'm going to ban you for a day means you're going to be gone for like a month.
[4655.14s -> 4658.58s]  Saying ban that person for 10 minutes means don't actually ban them at all.
[4659.22s -> 4676.52s]  I'm looking at the mod chat. So do you actually want us to ban that guy or not?
[4676.52s -> 4680.04s]  Question marks. Like four people have written question marks in the mod chat.
[4680.04s -> 4709.35s]  Five, no. Um, no. Three, five, six, go. One, two, three, four, five, six, go. Fuck you.
[4710.23s -> 4726.22s]  Is it Lemonworth? Yeah, it was so confusing. It happened at a weird timing. Whatever.
[4727.10s -> 4752.90s]  I thought this was Pac-Man. It is Pac-Man. There's slot machines in Pac-Man.
[4752.90s -> 4761.72s]  Please don't ban me. I'm not going to ban you. I'm kidding.
[4761.72s -> 4772.47s]  All right. So I think we're almost. Wait a minute. Our best friend Dig Dug is here.
[4775.86s -> 4782.20s]  Oh, this is Pooka. OK. Oh, so we have like a friend. This is pretty sick.
[4786.07s -> 4788.95s]  Pac-Man will go to any lengths to beat you, Pac-Man. Be careful.
[4789.51s -> 4807.05s]  You kind of look like Pac-Man. I think I did it right. Or is this a.
[4807.93s -> 4809.85s]  Yep, that's a wooden bag. All right, let's go to the next area.
[4813.82s -> 4818.46s]  You have a void expression. Pac-Man is very. Look, this is a void expression.
[4820.28s -> 4827.18s]  He's smiling. Really? That's a void expression.
[4827.18s -> 4831.62s]  He's looking how happy he is. Like, yeah, that's fine.
[4836.69s -> 4845.62s]  Oh, there's a space area. Oh, and let's go to the first level.
[4851.26s -> 4854.06s]  Oh, I can switch between them.
[4854.06s -> 4856.78s]  Fast travel. I guess that makes sense eventually if you want to go back.
[4857.06s -> 4867.90s]  All right, let's go. I think we're going to get a cool music change.
[4867.98s -> 4875.06s]  People are going to be very excited about this.
[4876.11s -> 4880.59s]  Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
[4883.79s -> 4894.86s]  That hurt. Wait, something up there?
[4895.38s -> 4916.07s]  No. All right. That's good.
[4916.07s -> 4919.37s]  You do the jackhammer sounds with your mouth.
[4919.37s -> 4926.39s]  Oh, probably.
[4928.75s -> 4958.87s]  And tried. Oh, lemon.
[4958.87s -> 4961.39s]  I want maximum coins for maximum gambling.
[4966.86s -> 4978.14s]  I'm not even touching it.
[4978.14s -> 4979.58s]  No, I don't get that.
[4979.58s -> 4994.72s]  I don't get hit. What am I supposed to do?
[4994.72s -> 5002.17s]  Am I having fun? Yeah, I'm having fun.
[5002.17s -> 5003.53s]  I'm having fun.
[5003.53s -> 5006.26s]  I have an itchy face.
[5006.26s -> 5008.30s]  Can somebody explain to me what that is, by the way?
[5008.30s -> 5019.64s]  Like for some reason, randomly, just pieces of my face will be itchy.
[5022.64s -> 5025.52s]  It'll be like scratchy. Oh, like, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[5026.32s -> 5028.53s]  What does that mean?
[5028.53s -> 5031.17s]  Why do it? And I'll be normal for a whole day.
[5031.17s -> 5033.61s]  And then it was my face will just start itching in random places.
[5039.19s -> 5042.17s]  Dead skin. You have too much skin there.
[5053.13s -> 5055.13s]  Somebody just say, I don't know, dude, take your shirt off.
[5055.94s -> 5058.29s]  Well, that's not what I asked.
[5058.29s -> 5059.53s]  I was asking. That's not what I was.
[5059.53s -> 5060.81s]  What are you talking? Why?
[5060.81s -> 5072.90s]  And that person for 10 minutes.
[5072.90s -> 5090.13s]  Did I get a I did. OK, I got to go back.
[5090.13s -> 5099.34s]  I don't don't only see what I'm talking about.
[5099.34s -> 5102.03s]  It's like itchy right there.
[5102.03s -> 5111.96s]  And it wasn't itchy there five minutes ago.
[5111.96s -> 5114.59s]  What the fuck? OK, whatever.
[5114.59s -> 5122.62s]  It's because there are worms in your face.
[5122.62s -> 5126.27s]  All right. I've done two out of two.
[5126.27s -> 5131.65s]  Let's see if I can do three three.
[5131.65s -> 5133.01s]  And they get hit by those beams, too.
[5133.01s -> 5136.29s]  No, sorry. You can't hit a ghost with a glass bottle.
[5136.29s -> 5137.85s]  So they can't get hurt by that.
[5137.85s -> 5156.91s]  I understand. I remember the logic from earlier.
[5156.91s -> 5157.59s]  Could have gone the other way.
[5157.59s -> 5159.91s]  That's a classic rookie pack in the state.
[5159.91s -> 5163.50s]  I should have gone the other way.
[5163.50s -> 5192.10s]  Actually, a rookie mistake.
[5192.10s -> 5194.22s]  What the why is that even here?
[5194.22s -> 5199.66s]  Come on. I was fine. I had it right there.
[5199.66s -> 5201.14s]  That was dumb.
[5201.14s -> 5203.30s]  It's stage hazards on a Pacman game.
[5207.17s -> 5222.51s]  This game has ass cheeks.
[5222.51s -> 5230.69s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5230.93s -> 5238.58s]  I thought it looked really weird doing that.
[5238.58s -> 5240.34s]  How weird did that look?
[5240.34s -> 5248.34s]  That's why I never have the camera on.
[5248.34s -> 5265.30s]  Very. OK, good. Holy shit.
[5265.30s -> 5279.35s]  Whoa, I'm too big to fit through here.
[5279.35s -> 5293.75s]  No. Oh, why does it feel like such a failure?
[5293.75s -> 5312.70s]  What are you doing?
[5312.70s -> 5314.62s]  When are you going to play Splatoon 3?
[5314.62s -> 5320.85s]  After I play Splatoon 1 and 2, which I have not done yet.
[5320.85s -> 5323.09s]  I don't like Splatoon. I told you already.
[5323.09s -> 5326.81s]  Because it reminds me of that old Tony Hawk multiplayer game mode.
[5326.81s -> 5344.80s]  And I would just get infuriated at it.
[5344.80s -> 5348.25s]  I think I got one of these, right?
[5348.25s -> 5356.74s]  In their door back there, I can do.
[5356.74s -> 5359.20s]  You're a monster.
[5359.20s -> 5364.42s]  No, I saw the Tony Hawk Pro Skater had this mode
[5364.42s -> 5372.58s]  where I think it was called tagging or graffiti mode or something.
[5372.58s -> 5377.94s]  And I would always get so screwed because a buddy of mine would get a one million point streak
[5377.98s -> 5382.36s]  because how it worked is everything you touched in a combo,
[5382.36s -> 5387.40s]  you have whatever you touch during the combo would turn into your team's color.
[5387.40s -> 5390.36s]  And I would just be playing and getting areas.
[5390.36s -> 5391.84s]  And, oh, yeah, I got the railing.
[5391.84s -> 5392.68s]  I got this ramp.
[5392.68s -> 5395.64s]  And then somebody that was really good at the game would just fly through,
[5395.64s -> 5398.95s]  do a million point thing on it across the whole game.
[5398.95s -> 5400.59s]  And then I just had to literally sit around and do nothing
[5400.59s -> 5403.77s]  because I could never get it back.
[5403.77s -> 5404.97s]  I played Splatoon for the first time,
[5404.97s -> 5409.57s]  and it just brought back those awful memories of, oh, let's go.
[5409.89s -> 5412.49s]  I'm going for it. I'm doing a good job.
[5412.49s -> 5413.45s]  I painted so much.
[5413.45s -> 5415.57s]  And then I turn around, the whole thing is gone.
[5415.57s -> 5426.94s]  And we just get absolutely dominated.
[5426.94s -> 5434.83s]  So you're bad. Yeah. Yes.
[5434.83s -> 5440.23s]  Yes, I'm very bad at that game. Yes.
[5440.23s -> 5449.55s]  OK. Is it mad because bad?
[5449.55s -> 5452.87s]  No, no, I'm not. I'm just bad at that game.
[5452.87s -> 5454.63s]  That's it. There's no more. There's no argument.
[5454.63s -> 5456.19s]  There is no argument.
[5456.19s -> 5458.95s]  I know people like expect. OK, this is a funny thing.
[5458.95s -> 5461.71s]  Like, oh, mad because bad. Oh, you suck at it.
[5461.71s -> 5469.80s]  That's why. Yeah. But no, you mad.
[5469.80s -> 5472.37s]  You got to get mad because you're not good at it.
[5472.37s -> 5473.73s]  Like, no, yeah, I'm terrible at it.
[5473.73s -> 5478.43s]  I'm dog shit at it. That's why I don't play it.
[5478.43s -> 5481.52s]  Oh, shit. All right.
[5481.52s -> 5484.41s]  Well, thanks for the scream.
[5484.41s -> 5491.86s]  How do I get out of here? I'm stuck in here now. What?
[5491.86s -> 5499.03s]  You need to wash your neck. What's wrong with it?
[5499.03s -> 5500.59s]  You know where I do get mad, right?
[5500.59s -> 5502.43s]  Because, for instance, if you say, dude, oh, why?
[5502.43s -> 5504.23s]  You just you don't like it because you suck at it.
[5504.23s -> 5506.59s]  You're just shitty at Splatoon. Yeah, Splatoon.
[5506.59s -> 5507.67s]  Yeah, no, yeah, absolutely.
[5507.67s -> 5510.63s]  Please, please continue to ridicule me because I agree with you.
[5511.03s -> 5513.91s]  But if I'm playing Elden Ring and I see like mad because bad,
[5513.91s -> 5515.31s]  it's like, shut the fuck up.
[5515.31s -> 5517.20s]  How fuck you? How dare you?
[5517.20s -> 5519.20s]  I know that I'm playing this game pretty well.
[5519.20s -> 5521.20s]  And like, I'm having a lot of trouble on this boss.
[5521.20s -> 5525.81s]  How dare you? Right. There's a difference.
[5525.81s -> 5539.64s]  Where's the end? Well, whatever.
[5539.64s -> 5542.05s]  If this is a game that you know you like
[5542.05s -> 5545.65s]  and you're having trouble with it, as somebody says, wow, dude, skill issue.
[5545.73s -> 5547.17s]  Like, fuck, I like this game.
[5547.17s -> 5549.17s]  Don't I want to be good at this game?
[5556.74s -> 5558.06s]  I didn't even mean to do that.
[5558.06s -> 5561.01s]  I just literally pressed the button three times and I just got it.
[5567.43s -> 5571.38s]  All right. I get too much rice.
[5571.38s -> 5577.46s]  Cherries are kind of worth nothing.
[5577.46s -> 5578.62s]  Why is the cherry so hard to get?
[5578.62s -> 5583.49s]  It's not even that big of a deal.
[5583.49s -> 5596.51s]  I thought I saw red.
[5596.51s -> 5604.86s]  I got it once.
[5604.86s -> 5608.10s]  You do a ball pit stream.
[5608.10s -> 5612.22s]  Oh, I might get lost.
[5612.22s -> 5613.14s]  That would be one of those streams.
[5613.14s -> 5614.82s]  Be like, guys, I'm here.
[5614.82s -> 5619.02s]  I've rented out a whole play place and let's go and have cameras everywhere.
[5619.02s -> 5620.42s]  It's oh, wow.
[5620.42s -> 5623.55s]  I can't believe it. It's just so fun.
[5623.55s -> 5625.95s]  And then we just we go to a BRB at one point.
[5625.95s -> 5627.99s]  I'm in like the tube hanging out.
[5627.99s -> 5629.19s]  Wow. He went down the slide.
[5629.19s -> 5631.07s]  All right. We'll be right back.
[5631.07s -> 5633.39s]  And you come back from the break and I'm just gone.
[5633.39s -> 5636.72s]  It's like, where is he? Where the fuck is he?
[5636.72s -> 5648.35s]  I'm just like in the ball pit.
[5648.35s -> 5649.43s]  I'm in the ball pit.
[5649.43s -> 5657.02s]  There's a line in the lap.
[5657.02s -> 5658.90s]  And it would be it would be the first BRB.
[5658.90s -> 5661.98s]  It would literally be BRB one after 15 minutes.
[5676.69s -> 5677.81s]  The ball pit is gross.
[5677.81s -> 5680.38s]  I I'm not I don't.
[5680.38s -> 5681.38s]  Yeah, I don't I would.
[5681.38s -> 5682.38s]  Yeah.
[5700.12s -> 5703.92s]  Ball pit of despair.
[5703.92s -> 5709.66s]  Anything over here?
[5709.66s -> 5710.82s]  Dude, you've eaten boogers.
[5710.82s -> 5714.93s]  You can't say that ball pits are gross.
[5714.93s -> 5717.83s]  Would you eat somebody else's boogers?
[5717.83s -> 5720.15s]  Would you eat someone else's boogers?
[5720.15s -> 5721.15s]  Yes or no.
[5721.15s -> 5723.47s]  The answer is absolutely no.
[5723.47s -> 5727.54s]  So what are you talking about?
[5727.54s -> 5729.86s]  If you've eaten boogers in your whole life before.
[5729.86s -> 5732.58s]  And by the way, can we just back up a little bit?
[5732.58s -> 5735.26s]  Can we just take a quick little break and understand?
[5735.26s -> 5737.14s]  I don't I don't do this shit.
[5737.14s -> 5738.46s]  I don't eat boogers.
[5738.46s -> 5740.54s]  When what are you describing?
[5740.54s -> 5743.38s]  When did I eat boogers on stream?
[5743.38s -> 5744.98s]  I'm a grown man.
[5744.98s -> 5747.75s]  What when did I eat boogers?
[5747.75s -> 5750.07s]  I'm not following when this happened.
[5754.89s -> 5767.26s]  When when you said you were going to drink stirs loogie.
[5767.26s -> 5771.66s]  That's no, but that's your hold on.
[5771.66s -> 5777.02s]  But that was for a very specific joke routine
[5777.02s -> 5779.34s]  that I was going to commit to.
[5779.34s -> 5782.14s]  I wasn't sitting there like, oh, oh, boogers.
[5782.14s -> 5783.14s]  OK, shut up.
[5783.14s -> 5784.38s]  Everyone stop talking now.
[5784.38s -> 5786.36s]  Are you fucking up my game?
[5786.36s -> 5787.72s]  Why the fuck did I just do that?
[5787.72s -> 5789.36s]  I hate. Oh, my God.
[5789.36s -> 5791.11s]  What an idiot.
[5791.11s -> 5791.95s]  What a fucking idiot.
[5791.95s -> 5795.31s]  I forget that people just will click that and share it with everybody.
[5795.31s -> 5798.98s]  Look what he said. He said boogers.
[5802.13s -> 5803.41s]  I'm too old for this.
[5803.41s -> 5805.74s]  I'm too old for this. I am.
[5805.74s -> 5811.00s]  I'm way too old for this.
[5811.00s -> 5813.12s]  Oh, my God. I'm getting flustered.
[5813.12s -> 5825.13s]  I actually am.
[5825.13s -> 5831.29s]  I like this music.
[5831.29s -> 5844.46s]  Wait, what?
[5844.46s -> 5846.80s]  Oh, my goodness.
[5846.80s -> 5848.56s]  All right. Relax.
[5857.28s -> 5858.12s]  Can't hit it.
[5858.12s -> 5859.00s]  OK, they got electrified.
[5859.00s -> 5865.80s]  I can't hurt him.
[5865.80s -> 5877.25s]  This is going to be sick.
[5877.25s -> 5880.42s]  Oh, my God. And look, look what happened.
[5880.42s -> 5880.94s]  Look what happened.
[5880.94s -> 5882.86s]  Look what I look what's going on over in this chat.
[5882.86s -> 5895.61s]  Everyone's talking about it now.
[5895.61s -> 5907.33s]  Oh, Grandpa Pac-Man is here.
[5907.33s -> 5909.72s]  I rescue Grandpa.
[5909.72s -> 5911.80s]  Pac-Man, there should be a key out here.
[5911.80s -> 5923.92s]  You need to find it.
[5923.96s -> 5928.74s]  Oh, come on.
[5928.74s -> 5933.23s]  What? What is this?
[5933.23s -> 5935.47s]  I ate the booger. I'm a booger reader.
[5935.47s -> 5938.51s]  OK, I just have a... This is a booger eating stream.
[5938.51s -> 5940.31s]  I'm just eating boogers.
[5940.31s -> 5943.51s]  When the webcam isn't on, I just dig up there and I eat the boogers.
[5943.51s -> 5946.93s]  That's what I do.
[5946.93s -> 5948.90s]  What is this from?
[5948.90s -> 5950.22s]  Why did I say that?
[5950.22s -> 5951.42s]  What was the point of me saying this?
[5951.42s -> 5952.02s]  I don't get it.
[5952.02s -> 5957.36s]  I ate the booger. I'm a booger reader.
[5957.36s -> 5960.40s]  OK, I just have a... This is a booger eating stream.
[5960.40s -> 5962.20s]  I'm just eating boogers.
[5962.20s -> 5965.40s]  When the webcam isn't on, I just dig up there and I eat the boogers.
[5965.40s -> 5967.04s]  That's what I do.
[5967.04s -> 5974.29s]  That's a stream from three years ago.
[5974.29s -> 5978.44s]  Oh, my goodness.
[5978.44s -> 5979.68s]  No, never mind.
[5979.68s -> 5982.74s]  I thought my microphone was messed up.
[5982.74s -> 5988.74s]  It actually might be.
[5988.74s -> 5990.50s]  Oh, yeah, it is.
[5990.50s -> 5998.78s]  Have you been hearing double this whole time?
[5998.78s -> 6000.75s]  No? OK.
[6000.75s -> 6001.95s]  That's from three years ago.
[6001.95s -> 6003.35s]  But yeah, it was definitely a joke, though.
[6003.35s -> 6023.25s]  I was probably just making a stupid joke.
[6023.25s -> 6025.29s]  Can you imagine admitting
[6025.29s -> 6028.96s]  to 700,000 people
[6028.96s -> 6031.88s]  concurrent viewers that you eat boogers on stream?
[6031.88s -> 6041.82s]  I mean, what the fuck?
[6041.82s -> 6046.24s]  Where's this key?
[6046.24s -> 6047.44s]  Jesus.
[6052.78s -> 6056.38s]  700,000. Yeah, my channel's like really dropped a lot.
[6057.22s -> 6058.46s]  You guys weren't here three or four years ago.
[6058.46s -> 6062.26s]  I was averaging three to five hundred thousand concurrent viewers every day.
[6063.26s -> 6064.06s]  I mean, the stream kind of fell.
[6064.06s -> 6066.22s]  And once I started doing like the booger reading stuff and
[6066.22s -> 6067.90s]  like jokes that people thought were like shitty.
[6067.90s -> 6073.47s]  I lost a lot of people, I think.
[6073.47s -> 6076.58s]  I was actually really surprised that I thought, you know,
[6076.58s -> 6078.90s]  they're doing a routine where I like eat a bunch of boogers on stream
[6078.90s -> 6080.62s]  was like, oh, maybe it was funny for a minute.
[6080.62s -> 6083.62s]  But I lost like three or four hundred thousand people concurrently.
[6084.98s -> 6088.86s]  So like I try to see like if the joke will land first before I do it.
[6091.18s -> 6098.61s]  That's kind of frustrating, but whatever.
[6098.61s -> 6100.45s]  That was my favorite stream.
[6100.45s -> 6103.17s]  Yeah, I mean, like some people thought it was funny.
[6103.17s -> 6117.43s]  But let's rescue Grandpa.
[6120.48s -> 6128.31s]  Thanks, Pac-Man. I'll wait for you up ahead.
[6128.31s -> 6134.58s]  I know the Apple. Oh, now I do.
[6134.58s -> 6142.02s]  I got to make sure I don't die.
[6146.54s -> 6147.82s]  That scared the shit out of me.
[6147.82s -> 6162.22s]  I didn't think it was going to go that far.
[6162.22s -> 6166.43s]  Oh, Jesus.
[6166.43s -> 6168.67s]  I'm not reading that one. It was fucked up.
[6197.70s -> 6211.94s]  Oh, secret.
[6211.94s -> 6214.45s]  I don't. I got to bounce from here.
[6214.45s -> 6224.06s]  This is going to this is kind of hard.
[6224.06s -> 6226.78s]  How do I get that?
[6226.78s -> 6227.74s]  Not like that.
[6227.74s -> 6231.81s]  Oh, my God. I haven't gone all the way back, aren't I?
[6231.81s -> 6233.53s]  Thank goodness. Thank God.
[6234.53s -> 6250.40s]  Where am I? All right, I got it.
[6258.92s -> 6269.20s]  All right, let's get it.
[6269.20s -> 6271.48s]  There's the A.
[6271.48s -> 6280.92s]  Oh, oh, read it.
[6280.92s -> 6285.55s]  Read what? I mean, read, read what?
[6286.11s -> 6287.87s]  What am I? What is a read?
[6287.87s -> 6296.65s]  How long is? Oh, that looks like I can get it, doesn't it?
[6323.69s -> 6327.32s]  And oh, hey, I got it.
[6327.92s -> 6335.42s]  Pac-Man is going to be a big one.
[6336.22s -> 6364.35s]  Whoa. Got them all.
[6364.35s -> 6369.57s]  I died. Whoa. Big one, dude.
[6369.57s -> 6371.97s]  Yeah, I know. I was pretty hogged up that one.
[6378.61s -> 6398.84s]  We're good. Oh, whoa.
[6398.84s -> 6410.03s]  Oh, my God. I'm fine.
[6410.03s -> 6419.58s]  Oh, my goodness. How do I get back up?
[6419.58s -> 6422.09s]  Dude, get up.
[6422.09s -> 6424.21s]  What the fuck is this here for if I can't do it?
[6448.08s -> 6452.37s]  Do you look like you know French?
[6452.37s -> 6459.29s]  I don't. I don't know any other languages.
[6459.29s -> 6461.37s]  I can't learn another language.
[6461.37s -> 6463.21s]  I know everybody says that.
[6463.21s -> 6465.41s]  Like, oh, no, you know, there's this program you can learn.
[6465.41s -> 6482.94s]  It's really easy. No, not for me.
[6482.98s -> 6493.32s]  Yeah, I, I definitely could not.
[6493.32s -> 6499.97s]  I would need a reason.
[6499.97s -> 6505.48s]  Um, I mean, you can learn a language to, you know, have to have a reason
[6505.48s -> 6509.45s]  to learn French or Spanish or you can just do it just because
[6519.74s -> 6521.90s]  I speak three languages and I'm not even 18.
[6522.84s -> 6525.50s]  I mean, that's that's a huge skill to have.
[6525.50s -> 6531.12s]  It really is. Think about think about this.
[6531.12s -> 6537.95s]  It's oh, I can only truly communicate
[6539.35s -> 6542.39s]  with a very limited amount of people.
[6542.39s -> 6545.62s]  I only know English.
[6545.62s -> 6550.22s]  My communication ability is much lower than yours.
[6553.03s -> 6564.74s]  It's weird to think about that.
[6564.74s -> 6567.56s]  Ever heard of Google Translate?
[6567.56s -> 6571.04s]  Yeah, there's a huge difference between Google Translate
[6571.32s -> 6576.24s]  and truly being able to be at a restaurant and talk to the person
[6576.24s -> 6579.36s]  or be able to communicate with somebody online and just be able to speak
[6579.36s -> 6581.52s]  fluently and just completely understand.
[6581.52s -> 6584.60s]  I'm not talking about like opening up a little book and being like, OK,
[6584.60s -> 6587.64s]  where do some how do I go to the bathroom?
[6587.68s -> 6590.32s]  No, I'm talking about you truly fluently understand the language,
[6590.36s -> 6601.54s]  like in and out completely.
[6601.54s -> 6605.30s]  Because even if you use a translator, you are not truly understanding
[6605.30s -> 6606.82s]  what you are saying.
[6606.82s -> 6609.34s]  You are just phonetically repeating something because you know
[6609.34s -> 6611.94s]  that's what it's supposed to sound like.
[6611.94s -> 6614.86s]  You're not truly comprehending what you're saying.
[6615.89s -> 6618.61s]  You're looking at a thing that's telling you what to say.
[6619.38s -> 6622.10s]  You don't know exactly why or how,
[6622.10s -> 6635.52s]  unless you actually learn the language fluently.
[6635.76s -> 6644.76s]  See, that's pretty.
[6644.76s -> 6647.12s]  There's no way to even gauge where your heart are you jumping.
[6648.73s -> 6652.70s]  It sounds like a teacher.
[6652.70s -> 6655.06s]  Hold on. Sorry, let me correct that.
[6655.06s -> 6656.54s]  Oh, boogers, right?
[6656.54s -> 6658.90s]  Is that is that what you want?
[6658.90s -> 6662.56s]  OK, is that what you're looking for?
[6662.56s -> 6665.49s]  Let me rephrase that.
[6665.49s -> 6666.69s]  What I meant to say was,
[6666.69s -> 6668.97s]  oh, probably probably move, Franché.
[6673.84s -> 6676.48s]  Let me make it so you guys can understand.
[6676.48s -> 6691.34s]  What's wrong with you? You get it.
[6691.34s -> 6693.78s]  You understand why I just did that.
[6693.82s -> 6696.62s]  If you don't know why I just did that, come on, Gwyn.
[6697.02s -> 6705.96s]  You know what I mean? Come on.
[6705.96s -> 6708.32s]  Wrong. I'm pressing A to hover.
[6710.39s -> 6712.41s]  No, I don't want to play in easy mode.
[6712.41s -> 6715.53s]  I'm holding A to hover because every other video game I've ever played
[6715.53s -> 6717.65s]  was hold the jump button to hover.
[6717.65s -> 6721.37s]  Every time you've seen me skyrocket to the goddamn ground.
[6741.86s -> 6745.43s]  God!
[6745.43s -> 6749.63s]  X, X, hold X, hold X, hold the X button.
[6750.27s -> 6753.07s]  Hold X to do this.
[6753.07s -> 6760.10s]  X, hold X, no depth perception.
[6760.10s -> 6763.46s]  No, it's called remembering muscle memory
[6764.22s -> 6768.98s]  for every single platforming
[6769.30s -> 6774.86s]  video game with a jump that's ever been recorded in human history
[6774.86s -> 6782.13s]  since when the cavemen were making video games from.
[6786.27s -> 6794.39s]  All right, settle down.
[6794.39s -> 6796.07s]  This game's not that fucking hard, man.
[6796.07s -> 6824.37s]  I got it. Relax. I'm going to be fine.
[6824.37s -> 6837.55s]  See, I figured it out.
[6837.55s -> 6855.50s]  Where's your face? I'm here.
[6855.50s -> 6869.18s]  Oh, yep. No, no, no.
[6869.18s -> 6882.11s]  I want to explore.
[6882.11s -> 6890.54s]  Yeah, the grenade works on those guys.
[6890.54s -> 6897.54s]  Pac-Man, please. Enough of that.
[6897.54s -> 6900.64s]  Yes. Game is this.
[6900.64s -> 6903.68s]  This is called Pac-Man World repack.
[6903.68s -> 6906.64s]  It's on Steam and maybe somewhere else.
[6907.00s -> 6922.17s]  I got it on Steam.
[6922.17s -> 6924.17s]  Yeah, it's a remake from an old PlayStation.
[6969.24s -> 6972.11s]  I got everything right. Yep.
[6972.11s -> 6983.18s]  Hogman. Yeah.
[6983.18s -> 6984.38s]  All right. I'm not going to screw this up.
[6984.38s -> 6985.34s]  I got plenty of time to do this.
[6985.34s -> 6989.92s]  Let's go. Go do it right.
[6989.92s -> 6992.52s]  I don't need to jump.
[6992.52s -> 7023.62s]  It's good. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[7027.10s -> 7037.32s]  I got everything. Yeah, I'm good.
[7037.32s -> 7040.56s]  Remember, your hair looks like it would fit really nicely on a groomed dog.
[7044.01s -> 7047.65s]  If I saw this kind of hair on a dog, I'd be very confused.
[7050.42s -> 7052.85s]  That would be very confusing.
[7052.85s -> 7062.83s]  Like, why does that dog have human hair?
[7062.83s -> 7066.11s]  It's like a one, one, two, three.
[7066.15s -> 7080.39s]  Oh, damn it. I'm going to sit further back.
[7088.93s -> 7090.53s]  They're all blending together.
[7090.53s -> 7129.66s]  Why are they all blending together?
[7129.66s -> 7137.66s]  Oh my God, there's so many strawberries on this one.
[7137.66s -> 7140.78s]  I thought it was one, two, three in a row, like one then whatever.
[7156.80s -> 7175.92s]  Oh, you suck. Hey.
[7175.92s -> 7177.72s]  All right. Where's the boss?
[7177.72s -> 7184.92s]  Get hype. Why do you look so mad all the time?
[7184.92s -> 7193.54s]  That's just my face, dude. This is awesome.
[7193.90s -> 7206.99s]  Pac-Man is a power pellet.
[7206.99s -> 7209.43s]  When you grab one, cannons are powered up for a short time.
[7215.61s -> 7216.57s]  That's a bomb dot.
[7216.57s -> 7219.09s]  You can take out all nearby enemies and obstacles.
[7244.31s -> 7245.99s]  I missed it. Sorry.
[7245.99s -> 7288.55s]  Excuse me. How did I not get that?
[7288.55s -> 7296.84s]  Oh, my God.
[7296.84s -> 7300.04s]  Oh, that's got way harder for no reason.
[7337.34s -> 7364.82s]  I was talking to this.
[7364.82s -> 7366.42s]  Who's my favorite character? Grandpa.
[7366.42s -> 7374.38s]  Pac-Man, for sure.
[7374.38s -> 7377.46s]  King Calaxian. That's a G.
[7387.24s -> 7391.34s]  What am I supposed to do about this?
[7391.34s -> 7421.33s]  He dodged that.
[7421.33s -> 7423.85s]  Oh, good placement.
[7448.98s -> 7452.70s]  Oh, I had I had checkers or Raleigh's.
[7453.14s -> 7454.82s]  I want to give you a review on it.
[7454.82s -> 7455.46s]  I forgot about that.
[7455.46s -> 7457.46s]  I want to give you a review about how I feel about Raleigh's.
[7458.98s -> 7460.95s]  Remember how I never had it before?
[7460.95s -> 7463.23s]  I had it. I had Raleigh's.
[7463.83s -> 7469.40s]  Let me tell you something very important.
[7469.40s -> 7475.54s]  Is it Raleigh's Raleigh's checkers, Raleigh's, Raleigh's, Raleigh's?
[7475.58s -> 7481.07s]  How I don't know how you say it.
[7481.07s -> 7486.36s]  I'll tell you after. OK, but yeah, I had it
[7486.36s -> 7488.76s]  during my tier list, my fast food tier list stream.
[7489.00s -> 7490.84s]  People were like, you've never had checkers before.
[7490.84s -> 7492.16s]  You've never had rallies before.
[7492.16s -> 7493.00s]  How is that possible?
[7493.00s -> 7494.36s]  And I was like, I never had it.
[7494.36s -> 7496.84s]  And I said, if I ever have it, I'll update you.
[7496.84s -> 7499.32s]  And I had it. So I thought, well, should I need to update you guys?
[7501.83s -> 7503.99s]  And I have a couple of very strong opinions on it.
[7504.63s -> 7506.79s]  I think I'm going to think I'm going to confuse a lot of you.
[7512.30s -> 7520.18s]  We don't care.
[7520.70s -> 7522.42s]  We don't care.
[7522.42s -> 7528.62s]  But whatever. I mean, I just want to let you know, dude, we don't care.
[7529.08s -> 7530.72s]  No, I don't care. Really?
[7530.72s -> 7532.84s]  OK, run a poll in the chat right now.
[7533.20s -> 7534.64s]  And I don't think don't.
[7534.64s -> 7535.48s]  Oh, whatever.
[7535.48s -> 7538.96s]  I like the streamers going off on like a story or a tangent.
[7538.96s -> 7539.84s]  I want to hear it. No, no, no.
[7539.84s -> 7541.72s]  They truly tell me the truth.
[7541.72s -> 7543.16s]  Yes or no.
[7543.16s -> 7545.08s]  Do you give a shit about that?
[7545.08s -> 7548.52s]  I've eaten at rallies and be very honest, like the take away
[7548.52s -> 7550.92s]  the fact that like, oh, you're here and hanging out.
[7550.92s -> 7554.40s]  Do you actually give a shit about what I'm about to say at all?
[7554.40s -> 7556.88s]  And I mean, truly be like, no, I really don't give a fuck.
[7556.88s -> 7562.08s]  I want to know if at least 40%
[7562.08s -> 7564.50s]  of you do not give a shit about this.
[7564.50s -> 7565.38s]  I won't talk about it.
[7565.38s -> 7567.40s]  And I'm very curious.
[7567.40s -> 7571.94s]  It's R-A-L-L-Y.
[7571.94s -> 7574.30s]  I want to see just how many people don't care.
[7574.30s -> 7588.75s]  That's so funny to me.
[7588.75s -> 7591.27s]  God damn it.
[7591.27s -> 7592.68s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[7592.68s -> 7596.11s]  R-A-L-L-Y-S.
[7596.11s -> 7605.39s]  I have no patience at all.
[7605.39s -> 7606.83s]  All right. What does it say?
[7606.83s -> 7610.81s]  How you guys feel?
[7610.81s -> 7612.89s]  Whoa. OK, it's a lot so far.
[7612.89s -> 7615.51s]  That's a very that's a big initial one.
[7615.51s -> 7631.67s]  Where 39% say no, I don't care.
[7631.67s -> 7639.39s]  OK, stop.
[7639.39s -> 7643.23s]  OK, it's this one right after.
[7643.23s -> 7643.95s]  God damn it.
[7643.95s -> 7656.16s]  They're the same shape.
[7656.16s -> 7657.56s]  All right. We're at 37%.
[7657.56s -> 7658.72s]  That means enough of you care.
[7658.72s -> 7670.40s]  So I'm going to do it.
[7670.40s -> 7671.48s]  Thirty six percent. Yeah.
[7671.48s -> 7677.50s]  I told you have to get over 40%.
[7677.50s -> 7678.50s]  So where's the next area?
[7678.50s -> 7684.50s]  Did I do it all?
[7684.50s -> 7686.36s]  Is there a next area?
[7686.36s -> 7690.82s]  How do I get there?
[7690.82s -> 7691.78s]  All right. That's it.
[7691.78s -> 7696.97s]  I'm going to talk about it.
[7696.97s -> 7698.73s]  OK. All right.
[7698.73s -> 7702.42s]  You've spoken.
[7702.42s -> 7706.78s]  The Rally's French fries
[7706.78s -> 7709.98s]  are the best fast food French fries I've ever had
[7709.98s -> 7714.42s]  in my entire life, in my entire life.
[7714.98s -> 7718.50s]  They are the most un fucking believable French fries.
[7718.98s -> 7721.35s]  They are unbelievably good.
[7721.35s -> 7723.91s]  It is so mind boggling how they could be that good.
[7723.91s -> 7726.03s]  They're that good. They're unbelievable.
[7726.03s -> 7727.31s]  Everything else is dog shit.
[7727.31s -> 7738.96s]  The whole fucking rest of the whole restaurant.
[7738.96s -> 7740.80s]  All right. The chicken strips were OK.
[7740.80s -> 7742.90s]  They were fine.
[7742.90s -> 7745.38s]  But everything else, I was like, this is kind of not good.
[7747.38s -> 7749.62s]  But I'm telling you right now, I would go to Rally's
[7749.94s -> 7753.22s]  and just get French fries and get a bunch of sauces and shit.
[7758.58s -> 7760.90s]  It's worth going to Rally's just to get the French fries
[7760.90s -> 7763.62s]  and just get about just get a three large French fry orders
[7763.62s -> 7772.11s]  and split it with like two people, three people.
[7772.11s -> 7774.44s]  How bad were the other food items?
[7774.44s -> 7776.60s]  They were they were just OK.
[7776.60s -> 7780.04s]  It was like, OK, dog shit was probably rude.
[7780.82s -> 7785.95s]  But the chicken fingers were just they didn't really taste like it.
[7785.95s -> 7789.35s]  It was just they were very like five or six at five out of ten.
[7790.24s -> 7795.96s]  They were literally dog shit, although they were five out of ten.
[7801.26s -> 7802.70s]  You got chicken at a burger joint.
[7802.70s -> 7804.78s]  I got a burger, too, and it was OK.
[7804.78s -> 7807.03s]  It was like fine.
[7807.03s -> 7809.63s]  Every other burger I've had from any other fast food place was better.
[7810.39s -> 7812.73s]  It was fine.
[7812.73s -> 7815.85s]  But let me tell you, the French fries are so good
[7816.86s -> 7821.22s]  that I want them so bad, so badly right now.
[7824.66s -> 7828.26s]  They are so crunchy and crispy and they're just perfect.
[7828.26s -> 7830.46s]  They're always perfectly hot.
[7830.46s -> 7833.06s]  It tastes like they came right out of an oven and they're like,
[7834.38s -> 7836.18s]  they're so unbelievably good.
[7836.18s -> 7842.74s]  I could not tell you how good they are.
[7842.74s -> 7845.14s]  You can buy them at the store.
[7845.14s -> 7846.30s]  That would be amazing.
[7846.30s -> 7849.58s]  They sell frozen frozen version.
[7849.58s -> 7853.17s]  I don't know what they're doing to those fries, but OK,
[7853.17s -> 7855.13s]  everything else is like a four or five out of ten.
[7855.13s -> 7858.61s]  But the fries being that good makes that like a C or a B tier place
[7858.61s -> 7859.81s]  that I would go to.
[7859.81s -> 7862.97s]  If I were to put rallies on that tier list, it'd be probably low B
[7864.38s -> 7867.82s]  only because I would order French fries and maybe like something else.
[7867.86s -> 7870.97s]  But just get mainly French fries.
[7870.97s -> 7873.41s]  It's literally a B for sure because of that.
[7874.69s -> 7876.06s]  You have to have them.
[7876.06s -> 7878.26s]  If you're like, dude, what the fuck is this fast food French fries?
[7878.26s -> 7881.74s]  Just eat them once and you'll be like, well, my life is forever different.
[7884.66s -> 7886.38s]  I don't know. Where's the next area?
[7886.38s -> 7895.24s]  Did I not complete enough stuff?
[7895.24s -> 7903.65s]  Was this dude?
[7903.65s -> 7905.89s]  I regret it. I should have said I don't care.
[7912.11s -> 7925.11s]  Oh, here we go. Two, one.
[7925.11s -> 7932.90s]  Oh, that looks cool.
[7932.90s -> 7939.42s]  I love McDonald's fries, but they can just they can be very bad.
[7940.64s -> 7946.40s]  I have had McDonald's Burger King Wendy's fries before that were just just sad.
[7947.28s -> 7948.92s]  And you just don't really want them.
[7948.92s -> 7966.87s]  It's just not something. It's just not good.
[7966.87s -> 7971.61s]  Hang it up there. Fries are inconsistent.
[7971.61s -> 7975.89s]  Yeah. I was actually going to make a tweet about it.
[7977.94s -> 7980.90s]  I was going to do a tweet where I took a bite out of one of the French fries
[7980.90s -> 7983.22s]  and was just going to be like, look, like, guys, listen to this crunch.
[7983.70s -> 7986.56s]  And that was going to be the whole video.
[7986.56s -> 7989.04s]  And it was going to be like, oh, like, Raleigh.
[7989.04s -> 7991.58s]  This is listen to this.
[7991.58s -> 7993.10s]  And I was like, that's a fucking weird video.
[7993.10s -> 8007.06s]  So I just didn't make it.
[8007.06s -> 8010.27s]  McDonald's double cheeseburgers.
[8010.27s -> 8015.10s]  Yeah, it's just I know a lot of people say, dude, McDonald's so bad.
[8015.46s -> 8019.42s]  Why do you have the pallet of a five year old?
[8019.42s -> 8020.34s]  Something about it.
[8020.34s -> 8023.18s]  Those did somebody just said the double cheeseburger from McDonald's
[8025.05s -> 8026.85s]  is unmatched from any place I've had.
[8026.85s -> 8027.89s]  It just is.
[8028.81s -> 8030.21s]  And it's not that it's the best.
[8030.21s -> 8032.73s]  Oh, it's the best quality hamburger I've ever had.
[8032.73s -> 8035.09s]  It's just it just tastes good.
[8035.09s -> 8039.27s]  It's just good every time I've ever had a child pallet.
[8042.14s -> 8043.94s]  Well, I didn't tell you about the salmon that I like.
[8043.94s -> 8047.21s]  Kids don't like salmon.
[8047.21s -> 8050.33s]  I can't name you a five year old that's like, oh, yeah, fresh salmon.
[8050.65s -> 8067.78s]  Can I have some? Sorry.
[8067.78s -> 8080.55s]  Oh, I can't hurt the big ghosts. Whatever.
[8080.55s -> 8083.22s]  Kids will eat anything.
[8083.22s -> 8087.10s]  I don't know how many young how many kids have you ever talked to?
[8090.24s -> 8093.09s]  Kids do not eat anything.
[8093.09s -> 8100.59s]  Huh? When I was a kid, I didn't just eat anything.
[8100.59s -> 8103.91s]  I had Captain Crunch for dinner half the time because I told you that story,
[8103.91s -> 8106.59s]  how I would be like, I want Captain Crunch for dinner.
[8107.76s -> 8110.96s]  And my mother would be like, oh, OK, yeah, you can have Captain Crunch for dinner.
[8111.76s -> 8113.08s]  But you've got it.
[8113.08s -> 8115.76s]  You can have it, but you have to eat dinner first.
[8117.15s -> 8120.63s]  So I would be like, oh, my God.
[8120.63s -> 8122.87s]  I can't believe it. I get to eat Captain Crunch whenever I want.
[8123.31s -> 8125.95s]  So my mother would I would eat all my dinner and be like,
[8125.95s -> 8128.35s]  I can't wait to eat Captain Crunch for dinner.
[8128.35s -> 8135.50s]  And she would give me this little like it had to have been ten pellets.
[8136.02s -> 8142.56s]  It had to have been ten pellets total what I would get after dinner.
[8143.48s -> 8146.63s]  And I thought I was a scammer.
[8146.63s -> 8148.55s]  I was like, yeah, mm hmm.
[8148.55s -> 8152.15s]  So I just have to eat my dinner and I can eat Captain Crunch for dinner.
[8152.39s -> 8155.83s]  Oh, I'm the most intelligent kid in the world.
[8157.82s -> 8160.50s]  And she was giving me the equivalent of like two spoonfuls of shit.
[8161.42s -> 8168.93s]  And I thought I was the smart one.
[8168.93s -> 8184.99s]  Oh, I need whiz metal.
[8184.99s -> 8189.18s]  Oh, that's just dessert.
[8189.18s -> 8194.80s]  Yeah. But in my five year old of six, whatever, your old brain, whatever it was,
[8198.04s -> 8202.48s]  it's the same story with the if what the hell?
[8202.52s -> 8208.12s]  OK, we're good.
[8208.12s -> 8212.30s]  Missing the A, but whatever.
[8219.01s -> 8222.41s]  It's the same story with the if his arm stays up, he's asleep.
[8224.54s -> 8228.70s]  I've told that many times, but there's probably a lot of new people on the channel.
[8228.82s -> 8230.70s]  Maybe should I tell it again?
[8236.30s -> 8239.58s]  OK, so when I would be and my siblings were younger again,
[8239.58s -> 8242.30s]  we thought we were the smartest people in the room.
[8242.30s -> 8246.90s]  Uh, you know, when when when you're when you're a kid and you're supposed to be
[8246.90s -> 8249.38s]  asleep in bed, you're supposed to be asleep, it's bedtime.
[8249.38s -> 8253.38s]  And no, I'm staying up and I'm going to talk and and do stuff.
[8254.18s -> 8257.22s]  And then, you know, you hear the here comes
[8257.82s -> 8259.86s]  becomes mom or dad to see like what's going on in here.
[8260.80s -> 8263.84s]  And, you know, you don't want to get in trouble, you know.
[8263.92s -> 8266.00s]  No, no, I'm asleep. I'm asleep.
[8266.00s -> 8268.16s]  So it's like you put your head down and I'm asleep.
[8268.16s -> 8270.32s]  I'm definitely sleeping. I was not talking.
[8270.60s -> 8273.36s]  We were not messing around having fun in here, right?
[8273.56s -> 8276.68s]  I was not having any fun in here.
[8276.68s -> 8278.44s]  And then they would come over.
[8278.44s -> 8281.32s]  And my mother and my father would say, oh, really interesting.
[8281.32s -> 8283.44s]  OK, they look asleep.
[8283.44s -> 8284.88s]  Yeah, I think they're asleep.
[8284.88s -> 8287.72s]  It's really one foolproof way to know if somebody's truly sleeping.
[8288.28s -> 8292.92s]  And they would come and take your arm and they would just lift it up and hold it.
[8293.24s -> 8296.40s]  And they would say, well, I mean, if his arm stays up, he's asleep.
[8297.50s -> 8302.86s]  And I would be sitting there going like this and in my brain going, yep.
[8303.30s -> 8305.18s]  Gotcha, motherfucker. Mm hmm.
[8305.18s -> 8307.96s]  That's me asleep.
[8307.96s -> 8311.01s]  And then they'd go, oh, oh, OK.
[8311.01s -> 8312.93s]  Very asleep. Oh, really asleep.
[8312.93s -> 8314.29s]  Asleep. OK, that's OK.
[8314.29s -> 8317.49s]  So it wasn't having any fun in here.
[8317.49s -> 8319.29s]  And I thought I was so smart.
[8319.29s -> 8321.73s]  And then eventually, eventually I caught on.
[8322.21s -> 8325.49s]  And I did this soccer flop.
[8326.21s -> 8328.57s]  Right. So instead of going like this and holding it up,
[8328.57s -> 8330.37s]  oh, his arm stays up, he's asleep. OK.
[8331.57s -> 8334.95s]  It turned into this.
[8334.95s -> 8337.03s]  Like, no way, I'm not falling for that one.
[8337.55s -> 8340.15s]  So exaggerated that I just flop it.
[8341.68s -> 8345.14s]  And the same thing would happen.
[8345.14s -> 8348.52s]  You were a stupid fucking kid.
[8348.52s -> 8352.22s]  Aren't we all, though?
[8352.22s -> 8363.44s]  He did this when he was 22.
[8363.44s -> 8371.65s]  I was a real smart kid.
[8371.65s -> 8374.25s]  I was smart. No, you think you were smart.
[8377.06s -> 8379.82s]  You were shoving crayons up your nose like everybody else was.
[8380.50s -> 8381.50s]  Come on.
[8392.65s -> 8413.03s]  I don't have banana. Oh, shit, it's right there.
[8413.03s -> 8414.23s]  Get up there.
[8414.23s -> 8424.74s]  Did I lose my opportunity to do this?
[8424.74s -> 8432.50s]  Oh, shit. Were you a glue eater?
[8432.50s -> 8440.51s]  No, I actually wasn't.
[8440.51s -> 8450.02s]  What was the tooth for?
[8450.02s -> 8461.73s]  I don't know. No, this is so annoying.
[8461.73s -> 8467.55s]  I actually can't get that.
[8467.55s -> 8486.73s]  Oh, yes, I can. I'm just stupid.
[8487.85s -> 8496.30s]  I was just do. Oh.
[8496.30s -> 8498.18s]  All he gives Derma 10 pellets of Captain
[8498.18s -> 8500.26s]  Crunch after he finishes all this hamburger helper.
[8501.54s -> 8504.08s]  This stuff is so good.
[8504.08s -> 8506.44s]  Oh, man, you just made me think of a hamburger helper.
[8506.48s -> 8509.46s]  What a bunch of junk.
[8509.46s -> 8511.34s]  What a bunch of fucking junk.
[8511.34s -> 8523.84s]  But it is the best shit in the world.
[8523.84s -> 8525.32s]  It's gross. No, it's not.
[8525.32s -> 8528.07s]  Don't stop.
[8528.07s -> 8530.59s]  Look, something can be weirdly unappetizing,
[8530.59s -> 8532.39s]  but still be one of the best things you've ever eaten.
[8532.39s -> 8536.31s]  It's got to stop. Come on.
[8536.31s -> 8538.75s]  I I know it's it's gross.
[8539.07s -> 8541.71s]  OK, maybe it is a little gross, but not but it's still delicious.
[8555.28s -> 8557.16s]  It's just so yummy.
[8561.59s -> 8564.46s]  Food snobs.
[8564.46s -> 8566.30s]  Um, I mean, I get it.
[8566.30s -> 8569.58s]  I get it. It's kind of filthy looking.
[8571.28s -> 8574.52s]  It kind of looks like somebody puked into a pan.
[8576.94s -> 8580.50s]  There is that period where you are making hamburger helper,
[8580.90s -> 8584.70s]  and it's at that gross phase where it's not really combined all the way.
[8584.70s -> 8586.82s]  And it just looks like somebody threw up into your saucepan.
[8587.74s -> 8591.34s]  And you're sitting there thinking, oh, help, this thickens up.
[8592.06s -> 8594.06s]  This is fucking awful.
[8594.06s -> 8595.78s]  It happens every time.
[8595.78s -> 8598.50s]  Every single time I've ever made hamburger helper, I've said the same thing.
[8600.54s -> 8602.06s]  I do like the Sims shit.
[8602.06s -> 8604.70s]  I'm sitting there cooking and I go.
[8604.70s -> 8606.70s]  Oh, yuck.
[8610.09s -> 8613.23s]  And then when it's done, I eat it.
[8613.23s -> 8614.67s]  And it's actually very good.
[8614.67s -> 8634.31s]  I'm very happy, though.
[8634.31s -> 8636.95s]  Get them all, get them all, get them all, get them all.
[8636.95s -> 8643.50s]  Yay. Perfect slop food.
[8643.50s -> 8647.30s]  That's the best way to describe it.
[8647.30s -> 8650.82s]  It's so weird because it doesn't hamburger helper have as many flavors
[8650.82s -> 8652.54s]  as Gatorade does.
[8652.54s -> 8654.54s]  There's like 15 different boxes, isn't there?
[8658.58s -> 8669.32s]  There's so many different kinds. Variety.
[8669.32s -> 8675.26s]  Yeah. You know what else is really good about hamburger helper?
[8675.26s -> 8677.58s]  It it'll feed you for a long time.
[8680.49s -> 8681.65s]  It's filling.
[8681.65s -> 8683.37s]  It'll keep you full for a while.
[8683.37s -> 8685.81s]  And you can put that in the fridge and keep it there and just heat it up.
[8698.35s -> 8700.31s]  Imagine it with chicken and not hamburger.
[8702.19s -> 8705.99s]  There is absolutely probably a bunch of TikTok videos
[8706.55s -> 8712.15s]  of hamburger helper hacks that are all all what you are describing.
[8716.86s -> 8725.53s]  I don't think you have to look very far.
[8725.53s -> 8731.30s]  Is there chicken helper?
[8731.30s -> 8733.38s]  See, that to me would be kind of strange.
[8733.38s -> 8734.54s]  Chicken's a little different.
[8734.54s -> 8738.26s]  How would you what do you chicken helper?
[8738.26s -> 8741.70s]  I don't get it because the whole thing with hamburger helper is it's ground beef.
[8742.18s -> 8745.62s]  So you just brown it in the pan and then, you know, drain it.
[8745.62s -> 8749.31s]  How do you you just dump it in with a bunch of chicken
[8749.31s -> 8751.83s]  patty strips or something about a ground is a ground chicken,
[8753.58s -> 8759.23s]  shredded chicken, this tuna helper.
[8761.67s -> 8764.27s]  I could go for a big fucking egg salad right now.
[8766.25s -> 8769.50s]  I make a great egg salad.
[8769.50s -> 8771.22s]  I make probably the I'm not.
[8771.22s -> 8773.42s]  I'm trying to be very clear here.
[8773.42s -> 8775.58s]  I make the best egg salad you've ever had in your life.
[8776.02s -> 8782.78s]  I mean it. If I sold my egg salad, it would I'd be a fucking trillionaire.
[8783.10s -> 8787.08s]  I would it would be it would be a story like, oh, yeah, I now own
[8787.08s -> 8790.32s]  and operate like 50 restaurants where we we all we have is that we have a bunch
[8790.32s -> 8795.02s]  of egg salad. That's like what we do.
[8795.02s -> 8798.34s]  Imagine the main menu item on your restaurant is an egg salad.
[8800.88s -> 8802.72s]  You guys have prime rib?
[8802.72s -> 8804.12s]  No, not at all.
[8804.12s -> 8808.68s]  Oh, do you have any like seared chicken or any, you know, tuna or no, nothing.
[8808.68s -> 8810.80s]  We have we have egg salad sandwiches. That's it.
[8810.80s -> 8815.98s]  But they would do what you're good at.
[8815.98s -> 8818.58s]  I'm telling you, I make my egg salad and you're going to fucking freak out.
[8819.38s -> 8820.54s]  Why am I acting so weird?
[8820.54s -> 8827.11s]  I don't know. Literally show me how you make it.
[8827.11s -> 8829.23s]  It's this it's a secret.
[8829.23s -> 8841.30s]  It's an actual secret recipe.
[8841.30s -> 8852.06s]  The secret recipe.
[8852.06s -> 8855.54s]  The secret is it's something else you add to it.
[8856.14s -> 8857.22s]  It's a secret recipe.
[8857.22s -> 8858.54s]  I'm not going to give it to you.
[8858.54s -> 8860.62s]  I have to be able to pass something down to my kids.
[8860.94s -> 8862.90s]  That's not watch me eat boogers on stream.
[8864.13s -> 8866.85s]  You know what I mean? Like there has to be something else.
[8866.85s -> 8868.93s]  Oh, yeah. What did Grandpa pass down?
[8868.93s -> 8870.65s]  Oh, he was a fucking weirdo online.
[8870.65s -> 8871.77s]  That's pretty much it.
[8871.77s -> 8873.85s]  No, he left behind his secret.
[8874.29s -> 8875.29s]  Grandpa left his.
[8875.29s -> 8875.85s]  I'm going to write it.
[8875.85s -> 8879.89s]  I'm going to write it down on lined paper and leave it out
[8880.01s -> 8882.33s]  and make sure it's old and fucking shitty looking in 50 years.
[8883.54s -> 8885.26s]  Make sure it's all stained and stuff so they can get it.
[8885.26s -> 8886.34s]  But what would they wait on this?
[8886.34s -> 8889.74s]  Grandpa's secret egg salad recipe so I can leave something.
[8898.52s -> 8905.94s]  Why am I back here?
[8905.94s -> 8907.94s]  To one was to two.
[8907.94s -> 8915.02s]  Here we go. It's not a secret.
[8915.02s -> 8916.54s]  It's paprika.
[8916.54s -> 8919.14s]  I don't it's I don't put paprika in my egg salad.
[8920.08s -> 8932.91s]  And what an amateur move that would be, by the way.
[8932.91s -> 8934.59s]  He puts hot sauce in it.
[8934.59s -> 8937.74s]  Oh, OK.
[8937.74s -> 8938.94s]  Oh, he puts hot sauce in it.
[8938.94s -> 8939.86s]  Yeah, that's what that's what it is.
[8939.86s -> 8941.66s]  That's the secret recipe.
[8947.50s -> 8950.58s]  Damn, that looks like it hurt.
[8950.58s -> 8953.54s]  No, I'm not going to tell you because I need to leave a note for my grandkids.
[8954.77s -> 8959.50s]  This is all I'm going to have. This is it.
[8959.50s -> 8962.62s]  If I say it right now, then it's then it's over
[8962.62s -> 8966.02s]  and I can't write it down on a piece of line paper and like burn it.
[8966.50s -> 8969.42s]  All right. I'm going to take a lighter and light it on fire.
[8969.54s -> 8971.34s]  Burn it. Put it out. Put it out. Light it on fire.
[8971.34s -> 8972.70s]  First, put it out.
[8972.70s -> 8975.06s]  So it's this old document that they have to find.
[8987.28s -> 8988.44s]  Throw it in a fireplace.
[8988.44s -> 8991.60s]  Yeah, like put it in a fireplace and then like get it up, blow it up, blow it out
[8991.60s -> 8997.81s]  and make sure it makes sure it's all old and fucked up and right on it.
[8998.81s -> 9002.41s]  Grandpa's award winning egg salad secret.
[9006.66s -> 9009.70s]  And hey, bro, roll up a few hundreds.
[9010.14s -> 9010.62s]  You know what I mean?
[9010.62s -> 9013.82s]  Roll up like 10 hundreds and like roll it up together.
[9013.94s -> 9015.34s]  So it's like, holy shit, we found this.
[9015.34s -> 9016.34s]  We found this shit.
[9016.34s -> 9018.42s]  Grandpa rolled up 10 hundreds.
[9022.91s -> 9024.11s]  You thought you would just get an egg salad?
[9024.11s -> 9027.23s]  No, you're getting like five grand in cash, too, at least.
[9040.24s -> 9041.48s]  What if they watch this VOD?
[9041.48s -> 9043.68s]  Well, I'm not going to say the recipe. That's the point.
[9046.38s -> 9049.06s]  Oh, I think I screwed it up.
[9049.06s -> 9057.30s]  Can I get back up again? All right, hold on.
[9057.30s -> 9059.10s]  What if the paper got destroyed?
[9062.66s -> 9064.85s]  Then I'm so I don't know.
[9064.85s -> 9067.09s]  You know, maybe I should mess up the text a little bit.
[9067.09s -> 9075.57s]  So you have to actually decipher it.
[9075.57s -> 9076.29s]  I actually want to do this.
[9076.29s -> 9083.18s]  So I got to get the plan.
[9083.18s -> 9085.42s]  Do you really want to you really want to get weird here?
[9085.94s -> 9088.59s]  Yeah, there will be.
[9088.59s -> 9091.20s]  So you guys right now,
[9091.20s -> 9094.00s]  my great, great, great, great grandchildren
[9094.56s -> 9098.32s]  will be able to watch this stream and potentially see what you're writing.
[9102.59s -> 9104.63s]  Do you understand how fucking strange that is?
[9104.63s -> 9108.86s]  You understand how bizarre that is?
[9108.90s -> 9110.98s]  We always look at photos of old stuff.
[9111.74s -> 9115.30s]  It's just a picture of your great, great grandfather.
[9117.28s -> 9118.68s]  Like that. And that's it.
[9118.68s -> 9124.56s]  And he was a he worked at a he was he was a he was a blacksmith or something, right?
[9127.78s -> 9130.50s]  Every booger eating comment I've made,
[9130.50s -> 9133.06s]  my great, great, great, great grandkids will be able to see it.
[9135.26s -> 9137.38s]  So this is where it starts.
[9137.74s -> 9140.66s]  Hi, kids. It's your great, great, great, great, great grandfather.
[9141.58s -> 9146.98s]  What I have done is I have buried secret family treasure somewhere.
[9147.74s -> 9151.48s]  And you are going to start your journey right now in the attic.
[9152.04s -> 9155.08s]  There is a piece of paper on that piece of paper
[9155.56s -> 9157.68s]  is a note with some instructions on it.
[9158.24s -> 9161.12s]  And I'm going to tell you the one hint you'll get here.
[9164.13s -> 9169.92s]  Doll doll.
[9169.92s -> 9172.16s]  And I'm going to put it in a fucking doll or something.
[9172.16s -> 9176.90s]  And that's how they can start doll.
[9177.78s -> 9181.74s]  And then they're going to go on an adventure.
[9198.17s -> 9201.20s]  You spoiling it in the Vod.
[9201.20s -> 9206.20s]  Well, what? No, no, no. What we'll do is we'll clip that section
[9206.20s -> 9209.04s]  and then I'll delete the Vod. Right.
[9211.35s -> 9213.39s]  I'm just I'm just losing. I'm not even paying attention.
[9218.22s -> 9219.38s]  How cool would that be, though?
[9219.38s -> 9221.42s]  Can you imagine? I'm going to do it.
[9221.42s -> 9223.42s]  You guys think I'm screwing around. I'm going to do this.
[9224.46s -> 9226.81s]  I am going to make it.
[9226.81s -> 9230.37s]  I'm going to do a big treasure hunt thing for my great, great, great grandkids.
[9232.54s -> 9234.98s]  You know, the equivalent of OK, imagine the old photo.
[9235.54s -> 9238.26s]  You're right now your great, great, great grandmother or something.
[9238.74s -> 9241.19s]  It was like like on the back.
[9241.19s -> 9244.47s]  You turn it over and it's the secret is in the doll.
[9245.63s -> 9249.00s]  And then you remember, oh, wait, great, great.
[9249.16s -> 9251.76s]  Yeah, the doll that's up in the attic.
[9252.12s -> 9252.96s]  What does that mean?
[9252.96s -> 9254.44s]  And they like take it apart or something.
[9254.44s -> 9256.76s]  And oh, there's a there's a there's a map in here.
[9257.24s -> 9260.94s]  That's what I'm doing for my grandkids right now.
[9260.94s -> 9263.82s]  So just wait, just wait another like 400 or 500 years.
[9264.34s -> 9266.82s]  And they'll figure it out.
[9266.82s -> 9267.82s]  And it's going to be so cool.
[9267.82s -> 9268.98s]  And I'm going to go on.
[9268.98s -> 9270.02s]  They're going to be a news article about it.
[9270.02s -> 9274.64s]  It's going to be awesome.
[9274.64s -> 9277.46s]  It's like, oh, it'll be like on Reddit.
[9277.46s -> 9280.26s]  I found an old buried stream post
[9280.58s -> 9282.26s]  from my great, great, great grandfather.
[9282.26s -> 9288.62s]  He put us on a treasure hunt.
[9288.62s -> 9291.26s]  Oh, yeah, old school, like subreddit, right?
[9295.54s -> 9296.90s]  And then when they get to the treasure,
[9296.90s -> 9298.70s]  like I say, I'm going to do all this, like, oh, wait, wait,
[9298.70s -> 9299.78s]  there's a secret family recipe.
[9299.78s -> 9303.22s]  No, it's just me like smoking crack, you know, like a Polaroid.
[9303.70s -> 9307.42s]  And that's all it is.
[9307.46s -> 9309.22s]  And then, oh, they're going to be they're going to feel real bad
[9309.22s -> 9341.63s]  about writing those articles.
[9341.63s -> 9346.06s]  What if you don't have grandkids?
[9346.06s -> 9347.18s]  I don't know.
[9347.18s -> 9351.78s]  Then just delete this because then I'll I don't know.
[9352.73s -> 9354.21s]  Why would anybody have left?
[9354.21s -> 9356.33s]  By the way, if you want to give me shit for that,
[9356.33s -> 9360.29s]  why did anyone leave a secret fucking family treasure recipe for anybody?
[9362.35s -> 9364.35s]  No, no, I'm not going to leave the treasure hunt.
[9364.35s -> 9366.63s]  What if I don't have grandkids?
[9366.63s -> 9372.78s]  At that point, I would have known, right?
[9372.78s -> 9374.62s]  If you're that old and you don't have grant, you're like,
[9374.62s -> 9376.99s]  of course, it's not going to happen.
[9376.99s -> 9384.21s]  I can give it to somebody else.
[9384.21s -> 9388.78s]  Remember, you don't have to leave family treasure hunts.
[9388.78s -> 9395.54s]  So write the clues in the library books.
[9405.10s -> 9406.42s]  Yeah, let grandpa have it.
[9406.42s -> 9408.70s]  Yeah. What do you mean? What? Oh, why?
[9408.70s -> 9410.46s]  Why? Who cares? Why wouldn't you?
[9410.46s -> 9414.53s]  What if you if you wanted to?
[9414.53s -> 9418.02s]  By the way, grandkids be the letter B.
[9418.26s -> 9419.76s]  Look for it.
[9419.76s -> 9422.00s]  I may have wrote it on the ceiling in the bathroom.
[9422.00s -> 9423.80s]  And then underneath that fucking ceiling tile,
[9423.80s -> 9426.96s]  there could be the next step in your journey.
[9427.76s -> 9430.50s]  Look for the letter B somewhere, right?
[9442.86s -> 9466.55s]  Where do I go? Where do I actually go?
[9466.55s -> 9469.37s]  Why would they watch this VOD?
[9469.37s -> 9472.21s]  How would it be a secret treasure hunt if I made it easy?
[9472.77s -> 9475.81s]  There's thousands of pieces of media that I've been in.
[9479.25s -> 9495.71s]  Do you want me to make it easy?
[9495.71s -> 9497.91s]  I want to be a secret family treasure hunt.
[9506.22s -> 9508.66s]  Jerma is trying to give his ancestors a lot of leeway
[9508.66s -> 9513.30s]  if he's expecting a random ceiling tile not to be replaced in 400 years.
[9519.07s -> 9520.71s]  That house probably won't even exist.
[9520.71s -> 9527.34s]  Just like bulldozer.
[9527.34s -> 9529.66s]  Well, how did anybody leave anything like that? Right.
[9529.90s -> 9536.06s]  But just have to bury it somewhere.
[9536.06s -> 9537.50s]  How would that even work? Yeah.
[9537.50s -> 9553.99s]  How did anybody find anything secret?
[9553.99s -> 9558.45s]  This doesn't happen in real life, dude.
[9558.45s -> 9568.32s]  Hasn't it once? It has. Yeah, it has.
[9572.85s -> 9574.57s]  Yes, it does. Yes, it does.
[9574.57s -> 9576.61s]  Yeah. So what the hell? Yeah, I could make it happen.
[9599.78s -> 9603.47s]  I know I'm going to probably jump on those, right?
[9603.47s -> 9612.22s]  One of these I'm going to jump on top of. No.
[9619.39s -> 9622.27s]  Your grandkids are going to see a really enlarged picture of your ass.
[9625.98s -> 9627.57s]  Yeah, I know.
[9627.57s -> 9630.53s]  Why do you think I'm trying to figure out and food stuff to leave them?
[9634.75s -> 9636.71s]  They're going to take one bite of the egg salad and go, wow,
[9636.71s -> 9639.59s]  this is actually on par with that ass photo.
[9640.94s -> 9664.92s]  I'm so glad he left it for us.
[9664.92s -> 9666.20s]  Wait, that's a key.
[9666.20s -> 9671.80s]  Are we going to be trapped here?
[9671.80s -> 9690.13s]  I jumped over that. Oh, it's the dog.
[9697.37s -> 9707.17s]  That was a triple right there.
[9707.17s -> 9709.37s]  Adjusted for inflation, you're going to give them like three dollars.
[9711.19s -> 9714.92s]  I'll do the math and shit. I'll calculate it.
[9714.92s -> 9720.74s]  Let me out.
[9720.74s -> 9722.82s]  So in like a thousand years or something, they find it.
[9723.98s -> 9726.30s]  What I said I was going to do by five grand.
[9726.30s -> 9728.98s]  I'll put like, I don't know, put like five hundred grand in there.
[9729.18s -> 9731.08s]  Well, no, I can't do that.
[9735.08s -> 9748.34s]  No, I'm not. Never mind.
[9748.34s -> 9751.09s]  No, no. How about this?
[9751.09s -> 9754.41s]  The only way you can get the money is there's I don't know.
[9754.41s -> 9758.17s]  There's a code attached to it that you can only know if you
[9758.49s -> 9761.77s]  if you like spread my recipe on whatever tick tock of that time is
[9762.85s -> 9765.37s]  I got to figure out a way to make it so like you got to.
[9765.37s -> 9767.53s]  I've got to be popular.
[9767.53s -> 9769.61s]  I've got my recipe is going to be popular.
[9769.61s -> 9771.70s]  It's going to be a huge deal.
[9771.70s -> 9774.94s]  And like only then when this exact account that, by the way,
[9775.30s -> 9778.62s]  I made an account on on tick tock and this account.
[9778.94s -> 9780.58s]  Here's the username and password.
[9780.58s -> 9785.26s]  This account must get five to ten, at least 5000
[9785.26s -> 9790.14s]  likes on a egg salad video of my recipe or it will not unlock.
[9794.62s -> 9806.12s]  That's kind of fun.
[9806.12s -> 9808.52s]  And the first thing you're going to be in a video with like a suit on.
[9809.94s -> 9810.94s]  I go, you found it.
[9810.94s -> 9813.75s]  Like, you know, I always do that.
[9813.87s -> 9816.87s]  Like the rich asshole is here recording a video.
[9816.87s -> 9819.31s]  And let me tell you, oh, so you found it.
[9820.55s -> 9823.07s]  What you need to do is you need to make sure that you.
[9823.07s -> 9838.60s]  Yeah, I'll go and I'll do a whole spiel.
[9838.60s -> 9852.46s]  Did I miss something over here?
[9852.46s -> 9854.34s]  He's a goose laying his own eggs.
[9854.34s -> 9855.66s]  What does that mean? What's that? What's that?
[9855.70s -> 9858.50s]  What's that mean?
[9858.50s -> 9860.54s]  It's going to be a sentient AI of you by then.
[9860.54s -> 9862.98s]  Not if I have a no sentient AI clause,
[9864.70s -> 9868.94s]  not if I make sure to tell my lawyers that under no circumstances
[9868.94s -> 9872.50s]  am I going to be a sentient AI and when we all sign it and it's fucking,
[9872.50s -> 9873.98s]  you can't do it.
[9873.98s -> 9888.73s]  Not if I put it a clause somewhere, I'll do it illegally.
[9888.97s -> 9892.73s]  But you're going to have to answer to the estate because I put it in a contract.
[9895.91s -> 9898.75s]  I like the fact that you're asking for clout even after you're dead.
[9903.95s -> 9905.43s]  No, I don't want the clout.
[9905.43s -> 9915.58s]  I want my recipe to have the clout.
[9915.58s -> 9917.78s]  Your consciousness is going to be free by then.
[9920.96s -> 9937.54s]  No, it's not.
[9937.54s -> 9940.06s]  Yeah, I only want my recipe to have clout, not me.
[9951.02s -> 9953.90s]  Your consciousness is going to eventually enter public domain.
[9956.82s -> 9958.90s]  Bro, I have not had enough beer to talk.
[9958.90s -> 9961.54s]  I have not smoked enough fucking weed to have this conversation
[9961.54s -> 9965.90s]  because what you just said is crazy and actually somehow makes bizarre sense.
[9986.34s -> 10007.94s]  Shit, this is a perfect run.
[10007.94s -> 10008.94s]  Stop talking about drugs.
[10008.94s -> 10014.66s]  My daughter watches you.
[10014.66s -> 10017.22s]  Hey, put your audience warning with this room.
[10022.68s -> 10025.58s]  Is this game pretty poggers?
[10025.58s -> 10028.41s]  It's it's all right. I think it's fun.
[10028.41s -> 10031.77s]  It's look, this would be a great game to sit down and play
[10032.94s -> 10035.63s]  with your grandchildren.
[10035.63s -> 10037.27s]  Hey, grandkids, how are you?
[10037.27s -> 10039.29s]  It's me, Jeremy again.
[10039.29s -> 10041.87s]  We're Aunt Pot, Jeremy.
[10041.87s -> 10045.52s]  I heard you found the note that I left you.
[10045.52s -> 10049.18s]  Let me tell you something.
[10049.18s -> 10053.48s]  Hold on. I don't want to lose.
[10053.48s -> 10054.72s]  Why would it be the same bot?
[10054.72s -> 10056.32s]  That's not fair. This is OK.
[10056.32s -> 10058.64s]  Remind me in like five years to do this again.
[10059.78s -> 10066.14s]  Because they need the second half of the code.
[10066.14s -> 10077.64s]  What's happening here?
[10077.64s -> 10078.40s]  Does it work?
[10078.40s -> 10090.49s]  What's going on?
[10090.49s -> 10098.99s]  Wait, what was I supposed to lose?
[10098.99s -> 10100.31s]  Oh, I already saw this cut scene.
[10100.31s -> 10102.98s]  Wow. I was not paying any attention.
[10106.90s -> 10109.93s]  OK. OK.
[10109.93s -> 10110.41s]  All right. All right.
[10110.41s -> 10112.57s]  So they're all they're all yellow now.
[10113.45s -> 10126.44s]  Now what? Oh, OK.
[10128.99s -> 10132.86s]  I get it. I get it.
[10132.86s -> 10135.54s]  I was supposed to go, go, go, go, go.
[10135.54s -> 10138.62s]  When I accidentally went, went, went, went, went, went.
[10138.62s -> 10146.25s]  Those are supposed to do it the other way.
[10146.25s -> 10173.17s]  No, not as hard as music sounds like fantasy.
[10186.68s -> 10190.39s]  Oh, oh, not as hard.
[10190.39s -> 10192.77s]  Why are there still people here?
[10192.77s -> 10211.41s]  But stop.
[10211.41s -> 10213.09s]  Oh, my God.
[10213.09s -> 10218.86s]  OK, this is just annoying.
[10218.86s -> 10236.77s]  Everyone's a hate watcher.
[10236.77s -> 10239.53s]  You. Oh, my God.
[10240.57s -> 10243.45s]  You'd be a great politician because you have no soul.
[10247.28s -> 10249.94s]  Whoa. Whoa, man.
[10252.38s -> 10280.33s]  Do you need to relax?
[10280.33s -> 10282.29s]  Oh, you want something insane?
[10282.29s -> 10285.41s]  OK, so last night, please.
[10286.60s -> 10292.42s]  Last night or the night before, I had 10 dreams in a row.
[10293.70s -> 10296.14s]  And Holly was was next to me.
[10296.14s -> 10298.78s]  And I kept on being in a dream.
[10299.93s -> 10301.37s]  I would go to bed.
[10301.37s -> 10306.06s]  She would hear me go, hmm.
[10307.46s -> 10308.70s]  And she'd go, hey, hey.
[10308.70s -> 10311.86s]  And I go, oh, and it happened like 10 fucking times in a row.
[10312.96s -> 10314.28s]  I was stun locked in a dream.
[10314.28s -> 10316.52s]  It was ridiculous. It was so bad.
[10316.52s -> 10318.32s]  Because, you know, anytime you dream
[10318.32s -> 10319.60s]  and you wake up from a dream and you go back
[10319.60s -> 10323.20s]  and you have a second dream right after immediately after, it usually stops.
[10324.56s -> 10326.84s]  After the second, third and fourth time of that happening,
[10327.72s -> 10331.52s]  you sit there in this weird, panicked mode where you go, oh, my God,
[10331.52s -> 10333.40s]  I don't want to go back to bed.
[10333.40s -> 10334.68s]  Is it just going to happen again?
[10334.68s -> 10337.39s]  Why am I a dog?
[10337.39s -> 10338.95s]  Yeah, like.
[10357.93s -> 10359.29s]  They always do that.
[10359.29s -> 10360.45s]  They always go.
[10370.29s -> 10373.45s]  But no, and so in one of the times, I'll tell you, it was so strange.
[10374.41s -> 10376.65s]  After the fourth or fifth time,
[10376.65s -> 10379.41s]  and they were such small, short dreams that made no sense.
[10380.55s -> 10382.31s]  I remember one of them.
[10382.31s -> 10385.03s]  Remember, I had to try to remember five to 10 of these in a row.
[10386.07s -> 10389.51s]  One of them where it was, I was in the hallway
[10389.83s -> 10392.03s]  where the bedroom is over here, I was in the hallway.
[10393.35s -> 10397.99s]  And I went into the opened up the bedroom door and it was like,
[10399.11s -> 10401.67s]  but there was no bed in there.
[10401.67s -> 10402.99s]  It was empty.
[10402.99s -> 10407.72s]  But in the room instead was just an empty room with no bed
[10408.40s -> 10412.86s]  and in a line facing the other way, one, two, three, four.
[10413.38s -> 10416.38s]  And then another line, one, two, three, four, looking this way,
[10416.78s -> 10420.46s]  which is these people in and they have white hair
[10420.94s -> 10424.38s]  and these black capes, just black cloaks
[10424.70s -> 10427.46s]  all standing and staring away from the door.
[10429.39s -> 10431.51s]  It was strange.
[10432.15s -> 10433.47s]  One of the other times.
[10433.47s -> 10436.39s]  So eventually, I know who fucking cares if I'm losing in this game.
[10436.39s -> 10438.30s]  Do you really care?
[10438.30s -> 10440.82s]  When I woke up
[10440.82s -> 10444.90s]  one of the last times because Holly had been waking me up over and over again.
[10445.60s -> 10448.68s]  And again, I fall asleep, I wake up
[10449.28s -> 10451.44s]  and will wake up in the dream, essentially.
[10451.44s -> 10456.36s]  So I fall asleep and there I am in that same area away from the bedroom.
[10457.30s -> 10460.50s]  And I was maybe 10 feet away from the bedroom door again.
[10461.70s -> 10464.42s]  But this time I knew that Holly was going to wake me up,
[10464.42s -> 10466.90s]  but I was sitting there going, oh, shit.
[10467.86s -> 10468.98s]  No, I'm too far away.
[10468.98s -> 10470.10s]  I'm not in the bedroom.
[10470.10s -> 10473.06s]  I won't hear her wake me up next to me.
[10473.66s -> 10474.78s]  I'm too far away.
[10474.78s -> 10477.53s]  I can't I won't be able to hear her.
[10477.53s -> 10483.75s]  It's hard. You want psychedelics? No.
[10499.17s -> 10500.29s]  What is he talking about?
[10500.29s -> 10513.46s]  I'm talking about a dream, dude.
[10513.46s -> 10516.10s]  And apparently, every time I was just I was just doing the
[10520.74s -> 10524.66s]  just breathing, just
[10538.98s -> 10540.34s]  did you eat before bed?
[10540.34s -> 10543.22s]  I think I mean, I usually don't get that close to bed.
[10552.02s -> 10554.66s]  Dogs are so funny, though.
[10554.66s -> 10556.02s]  I don't get it.
[10556.02s -> 10557.86s]  I know that they're just built so dear.
[10557.86s -> 10560.02s]  I can't beat this because I don't.
[10560.02s -> 10561.22s]  I'm all right. Let me listen to me.
[10561.22s -> 10566.51s]  I'm why I just pause the game.
[10566.51s -> 10570.74s]  So Otto will put his head down to be OK.
[10570.74s -> 10571.90s]  It's time for bed. Oh, yeah.
[10571.90s -> 10575.02s]  He gets comfortable asleep.
[10575.99s -> 10578.46s]  I wish I had that ability.
[10578.46s -> 10583.46s]  Dogs can just go right to sleep in a deep REM sleep immediately.
[10584.94s -> 10596.20s]  I envy it so much.
[10596.20s -> 10599.06s]  I'm not going to lose this again.
[10599.06s -> 10618.78s]  It's embarrassing if I don't beat this now.
[10618.78s -> 10639.74s]  You're so bad at aiming back, man.
[10639.74s -> 10645.15s]  All right. Here we go.
[10645.15s -> 10652.58s]  Oh, this is itchy.
[10652.58s -> 10666.53s]  What do I go for that?
[10666.53s -> 10686.32s]  I don't know. I don't know.
[10686.32s -> 10687.72s]  I last month.
[10741.37s -> 10744.83s]  Take a booger snack break.
[10744.83s -> 10747.87s]  This is it is going to be so huge in like a few days and I'm pissed about it.
[10751.98s -> 10794.42s]  From the umpire mask.
[10794.42s -> 10796.62s]  Would you rather fight this boss of the nameless king?
[10798.43s -> 10800.95s]  When is the Elden Ring DLC?
[10800.95s -> 10811.58s]  We're going to get me. What do you think?
[10811.58s -> 10823.48s]  That was a huge burp, and I'm so glad that you heard it.
[10823.52s -> 10824.96s]  There 100 percent will be.
[10824.96s -> 10828.28s]  I saw this thing where people said the time frame
[10828.28s -> 10830.80s]  between when the other from software games came out
[10831.52s -> 10834.12s]  and when DLC came out, we're pretty much at that point.
[10835.60s -> 10839.26s]  We're after about 10 months or so, right?
[10839.42s -> 10841.50s]  It's when we should think about maybe getting an announcement.
[10842.18s -> 10842.94s]  Depends on how big it is.
[10842.94s -> 10848.66s]  Maybe it takes more time to do this one.
[10848.66s -> 10850.46s]  Excuse me. Give me a break.
[10850.46s -> 10854.98s]  Pay attention. Please have help on you.
[10858.52s -> 10873.15s]  What the fuck?
[10873.19s -> 10874.51s]  What? Well, I'm alive.
[10874.51s -> 10876.11s]  What? How am I alive? What happened?
[10876.11s -> 10878.31s]  What the fuck just happened? Why am I alive?
[10878.31s -> 10901.50s]  I had no help. I'm dead now.
[10901.50s -> 10903.70s]  How are you supposed to avoid getting hit by that?
[10905.38s -> 10909.22s]  You have to hold this.
[10909.22s -> 10917.74s]  I don't know how you avoid that.
[10917.74s -> 10920.78s]  I have to dash. There's no area to dash.
[10920.82s -> 10923.46s]  Why is it so much harder than the whole rest of the entire video game?
[10923.82s -> 10941.65s]  I only have eight lives left.
[10941.65s -> 10942.81s]  I have to run towards it.
[10942.81s -> 10953.46s]  I don't know. How the fuck did you beat millennia?
[10954.02s -> 10962.52s]  Yeah, you think I'm paying that much attention to the Pac-Man game
[10963.00s -> 10966.84s]  because I am a good player in Dark Souls games.
[10967.74s -> 10972.30s]  Doesn't necessarily translate to a Pac-Man remake game
[10972.30s -> 10973.54s]  that like we're just talking about.
[10973.54s -> 10976.70s]  Like we're talking about my descendants
[10977.74s -> 10979.10s]  and me eating boogers and stuff.
[10979.10s -> 10982.42s]  I'm not locked in playing against millennia.
[10983.70s -> 10986.10s]  You can call that Kopeem if you want, but I did.
[10986.10s -> 10987.62s]  I beat millennia.
[10987.62s -> 10988.94s]  So I'm sorry.
[10988.94s -> 10992.78s]  You cannot say that I'm a bad gamer because that exists.
[10993.30s -> 10994.86s]  This I'm having a bad day.
[10994.86s -> 10996.42s]  OK, I'm having a bad day.
[10996.42s -> 10997.98s]  I have my gamer license.
[10997.98s -> 10999.78s]  I don't need to renew it right now.
[10999.78s -> 11002.42s]  I don't need to renew it at Pac-Man World Remake.
[11005.42s -> 11008.18s]  My license is not up for renewal yet.
[11009.26s -> 11023.46s]  I don't have to do that.
[11023.46s -> 11028.84s]  It's not remake, it's repack through.
[11031.18s -> 11042.58s]  All right.
[11042.58s -> 11044.62s]  I just have to beat it before he does that again.
[11044.62s -> 11046.22s]  Like a few more times.
[11069.03s -> 11092.92s]  What the fuck? It's broken.
[11092.92s -> 11094.96s]  No! What the fuck?
[11094.96s -> 11096.84s]  I keep missing it.
[11105.57s -> 11117.10s]  Good thing you slept mid fight pretending to be a dog.
[11119.36s -> 11121.16s]  I didn't do that when I played against millennia.
[11121.16s -> 11124.66s]  There you go. There's your difference.
[11124.66s -> 11128.98s]  I wasn't pretending to sleep like a dog when I was very focused.
[11166.42s -> 11169.18s]  Hey, what if you wore roller skates and got pushed down a hill?
[11173.14s -> 11179.42s]  Like an old Jerry Lewis movie?
[11179.42s -> 11182.06s]  You mean, I don't know how to roller skate.
[11182.06s -> 11186.03s]  Whoa!
[11186.03s -> 11189.75s]  And it's a bunch of comedy where I'm going really fast.
[11189.75s -> 11193.23s]  And I block my eyes because I'm about to hit a truck.
[11193.23s -> 11198.43s]  And then I go under the truck and I go, oh, oh, baby carriage,
[11198.95s -> 11200.47s]  baby carriage and mom.
[11200.47s -> 11203.95s]  Oh, and then I go, I hit the baby carriage and boom,
[11203.95s -> 11205.67s]  I got the baby in my arms.
[11205.67s -> 11207.95s]  Oh, oh, my God.
[11207.95s -> 11210.59s]  And then I make it to a bakery, right?
[11210.59s -> 11212.47s]  And like the baker, I drop the baby.
[11212.47s -> 11215.79s]  The baker catches the baby in a bunch of like dough or something, right?
[11216.59s -> 11219.51s]  Yeah. And then finally, I make it all the way down.
[11236.07s -> 11237.27s]  Excuse me.
[11237.27s -> 11239.99s]  I was about to think about stopping playing this game
[11240.71s -> 11242.43s]  until I just saw the next area.
[11242.43s -> 11244.95s]  So I'm sorry, we're staying.
[11244.95s -> 11248.71s]  I was literally I was literally about to say, hey, let's go.
[11248.71s -> 11250.07s]  Let's check out another game.
[11250.07s -> 11271.84s]  No. Cool.
[11271.84s -> 11274.92s]  I mean, some of the music really just kind of sound like it's coming out
[11274.92s -> 11277.28s]  of an AM radio in a car.
[11277.28s -> 11291.14s]  And am I the only one that's hearing that?
[11291.14s -> 11296.92s]  It sounds weird. Where's the two?
[11318.11s -> 11319.75s]  That was simple.
[11319.75s -> 11323.82s]  I could have made that any easier.
[11323.82s -> 11326.14s]  Can you please get the world record for clapping?
[11326.14s -> 11341.57s]  Yeah, sure, I'll do it right now.
[11341.57s -> 11343.24s]  How many is it in one second?
[11343.24s -> 11357.06s]  I could probably do it.
[11357.06s -> 11360.22s]  How many how many claps in one second is the world record?
[11370.67s -> 11385.88s]  How many? The one minute record is eleven hundred.
[11402.75s -> 11405.15s]  Eleven hundred in a minute is how many in a second?
[11408.88s -> 11411.32s]  Eighteen claps in one second.
[11416.02s -> 11419.98s]  OK, I need to slow this down.
[11419.98s -> 11422.73s]  Brrrr. Brrrr.
[11422.73s -> 11424.93s]  How many was that was?
[11424.93s -> 11428.29s]  But the the the the the the the the the I think that's ten.
[11429.09s -> 11431.81s]  Brrrr. You can't do 18 in one second.
[11434.42s -> 11437.63s]  Think about how fast that is. Brrrr.
[11438.39s -> 11440.35s]  I think that was me doing the like
[11440.35s -> 11443.31s]  that was like the the the the the that was probably 15 times.
[11453.02s -> 11454.98s]  How do you physically do that?
[11454.98s -> 11457.90s]  I can do like the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the.
[11458.34s -> 11460.62s]  I probably do like six or like ten.
[11460.62s -> 11467.64s]  That's crazy. Watch the video.
[11467.64s -> 11492.58s]  There's a video. It's time to.
[11492.58s -> 11509.14s]  OK, there's an ad. Just hold on.
[11509.14s -> 11512.98s]  OK, so this is the world record.
[11512.98s -> 11516.05s]  This is the world record you're saying right here.
[11516.05s -> 11523.73s]  World record most claps in one minute.
[11523.73s -> 11526.53s]  Well, they have to show it.
[11526.53s -> 11527.73s]  Wait, what?
[11527.73s -> 11528.97s]  Hello, my name is seven.
[11528.97s -> 11531.53s]  I'm going to try to break the record
[11531.53s -> 11533.09s]  of speed clapping.
[11533.09s -> 11535.11s]  We're going to start.
[11535.11s -> 11537.54s]  So, you know, the market said.
[11537.54s -> 11546.66s]  Wait, what? Oh, what is happening here?
[11554.74s -> 11556.38s]  This music does not fit.
[11556.38s -> 11579.01s]  Can I just say, wow, I'm so confused.
[11579.05s -> 11582.03s]  So he is essentially sliding.
[11584.81s -> 11586.65s]  This is one hand clapping.
[11586.65s -> 11603.39s]  What? But in slow mo, I don't even have to.
[11616.50s -> 11618.66s]  OK, so I see what's going on.
[11623.22s -> 11626.70s]  So he's he's hitting the bottom part of his palm
[11626.70s -> 11630.22s]  with the top of his fingers on the opposite hand.
[11630.22s -> 11634.02s]  So he's going like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[11634.02s -> 11638.75s]  Let me try.
[11638.75s -> 11641.82s]  So it's it's like here and then here.
[11641.82s -> 11642.66s]  So that he's hitting.
[11642.66s -> 11659.29s]  This is where the contact is, is here and here.
[11659.29s -> 11664.71s]  Ah, how do you do that for a full minute?
[11669.35s -> 11682.31s]  Bad form. How do you do that for a minute?
[11682.31s -> 11683.82s]  Go for it for a minute.
[11683.82s -> 11699.58s]  All right. I'm going to do it for a minute. Time me.
[11699.58s -> 11700.82s]  You guys, should we time me?
[11700.82s -> 11702.98s]  Turn the. OK, let me let me get my noise gate off.
[11702.98s -> 11738.10s]  Hold on. OK. All right. That's fine.
[11738.10s -> 11740.83s]  All right. Let me try it.
[11740.83s -> 11744.35s]  Is that better? Is the noise gate gone?
[11744.35s -> 11750.00s]  OK, here we go.
[11750.00s -> 11762.71s]  Three, two, one timing.
[11799.32s -> 11813.07s]  My arms are fucking burning.
[11813.07s -> 11816.70s]  I'm still down there.
[11816.70s -> 11818.10s]  Don't do it down there.
[11818.10s -> 11819.76s]  Don't do it down here.
[11819.76s -> 11823.10s]  Don't do that down here.
[11823.10s -> 11825.70s]  You do not want the sound of me playing while I'm doing it down here.
[11829.34s -> 11831.78s]  That is so much strength to do that.
[11831.78s -> 11836.58s]  Even just fucking faking it, even just faking it.
[11837.84s -> 11840.36s]  That hurt bad. That's unbelievable.
[11843.70s -> 11845.62s]  That takes actual talent and skill to do that.
[11849.10s -> 11859.36s]  OK, let's go.
[11859.40s -> 11862.50s]  You had me for a little bit.
[11862.50s -> 11888.85s]  Pac-Man. Oh, yeah.
[11888.85s -> 11908.22s]  That was such a weird. Oh, yeah.
[11908.22s -> 11915.98s]  Don't even turn his whole arm weighs five pounds.
[11916.06s -> 11919.36s]  Yeah. What do you think?
[11919.36s -> 11921.50s]  Now you say that again.
[11921.50s -> 11922.54s]  Let's say that again.
[11922.54s -> 11924.72s]  That's what you think.
[11924.72s -> 11938.50s]  I got a big fucking arm.
[11938.50s -> 11939.46s]  The same thing happens again.
[11939.46s -> 11942.13s]  I'm going to scream.
[11942.13s -> 11943.61s]  Nice turkey arms.
[11943.61s -> 11946.34s]  Ah, that's fine. Call me a turkey.
[11946.34s -> 11947.58s]  Oh, he's got a turkey neck.
[11947.58s -> 11948.90s]  He's got turkey on turkey.
[11948.90s -> 11951.02s]  Turkeys are one of the most vicious fucking animals on earth.
[11951.70s -> 11953.74s]  They're so deadly and they're crazy.
[11953.74s -> 11956.34s]  They will attack you and they're very deadly.
[11957.44s -> 11960.82s]  They're incredibly strong.
[11960.82s -> 11963.06s]  You ever seen a turkey?
[11963.06s -> 11965.10s]  You guys actually seen a turkey in real life?
[11965.10s -> 11967.58s]  They are massive, majestic pieces.
[11968.78s -> 11971.58s]  They're huge and they're very dangerous.
[11992.51s -> 11993.91s]  Turkeys are docile.
[11993.91s -> 12011.08s]  Turkeys are very, very strong.
[12011.08s -> 12012.76s]  You know, like the zodiac signs.
[12012.76s -> 12040.67s]  I wish mine was a turkey.
[12040.67s -> 12041.91s]  These games get pretty good graphics.
[12041.91s -> 12056.71s]  This is a cute game.
[12056.75s -> 12059.34s]  Is there a game pivot coming soon?
[12059.34s -> 12060.62s]  Oh, you know what?
[12060.62s -> 12063.24s]  Did Vampire Survivors have an update?
[12063.24s -> 12064.08s]  I feel like it did.
[12064.08s -> 12065.46s]  Did I play it?
[12065.46s -> 12067.82s]  Dude, another game came out that was just,
[12067.82s -> 12069.34s]  it looked just like Vampire Survivors.
[12069.34s -> 12071.57s]  It came out like two days ago.
[12071.57s -> 12078.46s]  Is that one any good?
[12078.46s -> 12086.12s]  It's really good.
[12086.12s -> 12088.48s]  It's got something else, survivors.
[12088.48s -> 12090.84s]  It's just, it's just, it's just,
[12090.84s -> 12106.42s]  it's just Vampire Survivors is what it looks like.
[12106.42s -> 12111.11s]  Oh, come on.
[12111.11s -> 12112.15s]  Taco Bell or McDonald's?
[12112.15s -> 12113.27s]  Well, that depends on what you're going to order
[12113.27s -> 12116.22s]  from Taco Bell.
[12116.22s -> 12119.81s]  If your order at Taco Bell is the cheesy Gordita crunch,
[12119.85s -> 12122.70s]  then that's what you're going to get.
[12122.70s -> 12125.82s]  If you get some other weird bullshit from Taco Bell
[12125.82s -> 12127.26s]  that's not very good, then I'm sorry.
[12127.26s -> 12128.10s]  I'm going to have to tell you that's,
[12128.10s -> 12135.69s]  I'm going to recommend not.
[12135.69s -> 12144.18s]  Oh, I like this level.
[12144.18s -> 12145.02s]  Doritos tacos.
[12145.02s -> 12149.54s]  Doritos tacos are, I always feel so bad eating them
[12149.54s -> 12152.06s]  because I just know there's almost nothing
[12152.06s -> 12154.79s]  that I really want in my body from that.
[12154.79s -> 12157.83s]  But you can't deny that it's one of the greatest tasting
[12157.83s -> 12171.24s]  things in the world.
[12171.24s -> 12172.08s]  How am I doing?
[12172.08s -> 12173.69s]  I'm doing okay.
[12173.69s -> 12176.60s]  I'm doing good.
[12176.60s -> 12182.74s]  I'm doing as good as I can be, right?
[12182.74s -> 12184.82s]  I'm on a fast stop.
[12184.82s -> 12188.10s]  I'm so sorry to hear that.
[12188.10s -> 12191.95s]  Yeah, that's, that's hard.
[12191.95s -> 12194.03s]  When I had my colonoscopy done,
[12194.03s -> 12196.03s]  I remember you have to fast for three days.
[12198.07s -> 12199.75s]  I think it was like three, four days.
[12199.75s -> 12202.08s]  You can't have food.
[12202.08s -> 12205.06s]  You can have clear liquids.
[12205.06s -> 12208.62s]  And I think that there's one or two very,
[12208.62s -> 12210.38s]  very basic small things,
[12210.38s -> 12214.91s]  but you can't eat food for three days.
[12214.91s -> 12216.99s]  One of the things that happens,
[12217.03s -> 12218.51s]  it's not the fact that not eating food
[12218.51s -> 12220.87s]  that is what caused me problems.
[12220.87s -> 12221.95s]  It's like, I can handle that.
[12221.95s -> 12224.79s]  Look, after a day or two where you just,
[12224.79s -> 12226.67s]  God, I just want a fucking steak.
[12227.51s -> 12229.27s]  But what really is the problem for me,
[12229.27s -> 12233.87s]  it's not that, it's the fact that the headache,
[12233.87s -> 12237.55s]  that kind of, like you haven't had no real nutrients
[12237.55s -> 12238.43s]  for two or three days.
[12238.43s -> 12241.79s]  You just have this migraine that is just awful.
[12241.79s -> 12244.21s]  At least that's what happened to me.
[12244.21s -> 12247.86s]  Yeah, the actual procedure is simple.
[12247.86s -> 12251.11s]  It's one of the easiest things in the world.
[12251.11s -> 12253.91s]  It's the prep for a colonoscopy that sucks.
[12253.91s -> 12256.15s]  It's not, the procedure is easy.
[12256.15s -> 12259.74s]  It's 100% simple.
[12259.74s -> 12281.92s]  There's a fruit that's fond, oh, you can get it.
[12281.92s -> 12285.38s]  All right, open that drawer.
[12285.38s -> 12294.39s]  I mean, how did I miss the first N?
[12294.39s -> 12295.83s]  Anybody pictures from the procedure?
[12295.83s -> 12300.54s]  I'm definitely not going to share my colonoscopy photos.
[12300.54s -> 12303.90s]  I think that would get me banned from Twitch.
[12303.90s -> 12312.46s]  I don't think you can, I'm not sure you can do that.
[12312.46s -> 12314.46s]  You have to drink, yeah, they give you this drink
[12314.46s -> 12317.27s]  that you have to drink over the course of a couple of days.
[12317.27s -> 12322.26s]  And let me just tell you without giving you too much detail.
[12322.26s -> 12332.18s]  It makes you do something over and over again.
[12332.18s -> 12343.22s]  Just distort the image.
[12343.22s -> 12344.98s]  What, I wonder what?
[12344.98s -> 12348.82s]  You can use your imagination.
[12348.82s -> 12350.10s]  I want to see what the boss of this area is
[12350.10s -> 12351.86s]  and then we'll play either Vampire Survivors
[12351.86s -> 12354.38s]  or I want to, maybe I'll try that new one.
[12354.38s -> 12355.70s]  You guys are telling me,
[12355.70s -> 12360.42s]  actually figure out what the hell it's called.
[12360.42s -> 12365.31s]  It's called, it came out like today.
[12365.31s -> 12369.98s]  It's called Soul Stone Survivors Prologue.
[12369.98s -> 12371.30s]  It's not the full game, I guess.
[12371.30s -> 12374.66s]  Is that one any good?
[12374.66s -> 12382.94s]  I tried it.
[12382.98s -> 12397.65s]  It's pretty good.
[12397.65s -> 12400.01s]  You know, I kind of wish there was a retro mode
[12400.01s -> 12402.53s]  to see what this looked like 15 plus years ago,
[12402.53s -> 12413.50s]  whatever it was, 20 years ago.
[12413.50s -> 12414.94s]  Are you going to rage with Pac-Man?
[12414.94s -> 12417.70s]  No, I'm not.
[12417.70s -> 12425.63s]  I was just considering a pivot.
[12425.63s -> 12426.59s]  I feel like this game is pretty long.
[12426.59s -> 12442.58s]  It's probably at least six to seven levels long.
[12442.58s -> 12445.18s]  Remember, I'm the never complete a game Andy,
[12445.18s -> 12463.78s]  unless it's a from software game.
[12463.78s -> 12469.46s]  Ooh, what's in here?
[12469.46s -> 12472.30s]  I wouldn't need this.
[12472.30s -> 12473.58s]  Water or somewhere that I missed?
[12473.58s -> 12477.77s]  Oh well.
[12477.77s -> 12478.93s]  Do a BRB then switch game.
[12478.93s -> 12482.38s]  Yeah, that's what I'll probably end up doing.
[12482.38s -> 12489.72s]  I mean, is there, how far am I to the end of the game?
[12489.72s -> 12490.64s]  Is there another area?
[12490.64s -> 12496.97s]  There's probably at least one more area after this.
[12496.97s -> 12510.32s]  Two more worlds.
[12510.32s -> 12513.58s]  World four of six.
[12513.58s -> 12517.70s]  Hmm, do I want to complete Pac-Man world
[12517.70s -> 12520.84s]  just to say that I did?
[12520.84s -> 12527.74s]  Or do I leave this up to interpretation for you?
[12527.74s -> 12528.98s]  Because you guys, you could find out for yourself
[12528.98s -> 12531.87s]  what happens in the end.
[12531.87s -> 12537.06s]  Does the evil Pac-Man kill everyone
[12537.06s -> 12539.19s]  and take over Pac-World?
[12539.19s -> 12540.03s]  I don't know.
[12540.03s -> 12553.02s]  I guess, but I don't know if we're ever going to know.
[12553.02s -> 12571.27s]  Ooh, hot plates.
[12571.27s -> 12575.66s]  Hmm, why?
[12575.66s -> 12582.84s]  I supposed to be the clown boss.
[12582.84s -> 12585.09s]  And then, all right, do a poll right now.
[12585.09s -> 12588.61s]  Should I play the new vampire survivors?
[12591.58s -> 12593.92s]  Vampire survivors like,
[12593.92s -> 12596.74s]  or should I play vampire survivors?
[12596.74s -> 12615.14s]  Let's do a vote.
[12615.14s -> 12626.21s]  Don't even fall.
[12626.21s -> 12627.69s]  What am I looking at here?
[12627.69s -> 12629.37s]  Wait, can I not?
[12629.37s -> 12632.00s]  Oh, right here.
[12632.00s -> 12633.28s]  Ultra kill got an update.
[12636.33s -> 12638.69s]  I don't know if I'm in the first person shooter
[12638.69s -> 12646.28s]  crack mode right now.
[12646.28s -> 12658.23s]  I don't think I'm in crack mode at the moment.
[12664.94s -> 12665.78s]  Next thing we're going to do,
[12665.78s -> 12668.30s]  we're going to go back to sorcery part three.
[12668.30s -> 12671.40s]  That's what we're going to do on Wednesday.
[12671.40s -> 12681.38s]  And then wait, hold on.
[12681.38s -> 12684.92s]  All right, all right.
[12684.92s -> 12687.63s]  So I can officially announce.
[12687.63s -> 12690.46s]  All right, it's time for the official announcement.
[12690.46s -> 12696.26s]  I, Jeremy Elbertson, AKA German985 on Thursday.
[12697.94s -> 12699.26s]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[12699.26s -> 12701.38s]  I'm going to be on Name Your Price.
[12701.38s -> 12704.67s]  Austin show.
[12704.67s -> 12705.51s]  Oh my God.
[12705.51s -> 12707.63s]  Why can I not just remember to press?
[12707.63s -> 12716.46s]  It's not the jump button.
[12716.46s -> 12718.74s]  I will be on Name Your Price.
[12718.74s -> 12721.78s]  I think I'm going to do a pretty good job.
[12721.78s -> 12724.28s]  What time is it going to be at?
[12724.28s -> 12728.46s]  I don't, I think somewhere around two Pacific.
[12728.46s -> 12734.88s]  I think we're around somewhere between one and two Pacific.
[12734.88s -> 12737.10s]  It's a game show.
[12737.10s -> 12737.98s]  Who am I going to be against?
[12737.98s -> 12741.18s]  I actually don't know.
[12741.18s -> 12746.84s]  You'll have to, you have to watch.
[12746.84s -> 12748.52s]  You're going to play Glover?
[12748.52s -> 12752.64s]  Ah, how do we watch it?
[12752.64s -> 12758.36s]  It's going to be on Austin show.
[12758.36s -> 12763.60s]  You don't know Austin show.
[12763.60s -> 12764.72s]  I would go follow it now.
[12764.72s -> 12766.96s]  Follow the channel.
[12766.96s -> 12778.28s]  Follow Austin.
[12778.28s -> 12785.07s]  He's a streamer.
[12785.07s -> 12785.91s]  Is it going to be on Twitch?
[12785.91s -> 12787.69s]  Yes.
[12787.69s -> 12791.77s]  It will be on twitch.tv.
[12791.77s -> 12792.81s]  I'm very excited.
[12792.81s -> 12795.06s]  The concept of the stream.
[12795.06s -> 12797.98s]  It's a game show, obviously.
[12797.98s -> 12803.32s]  And it's kind of like, they show products
[12803.32s -> 12805.80s]  and you have to guess how whoever gets closest
[12805.80s -> 12809.96s]  to what the actual cost of the product was or is.
[12809.96s -> 12812.80s]  Kind of like, almost like the prices, right?
[12812.80s -> 12815.81s]  Kind of style.
[12815.81s -> 12833.50s]  I think I'll do a pretty good job.
[12833.50s -> 12836.66s]  Sounds good.
[12836.66s -> 12838.77s]  Yeah, no, it should be fun.
[12838.77s -> 12840.38s]  I'm excited.
[12840.38s -> 12843.07s]  It's going to be in person too.
[12843.07s -> 12843.91s]  So it is.
[12850.04s -> 12856.54s]  Ooh, that was a tough jump.
[12856.54s -> 12861.72s]  That's this Thursday at 2 p.m. Pacific
[12861.72s -> 12865.80s]  on Austin's channel, Austin show.
[12865.80s -> 12866.76s]  Are you, I'll tweet it out.
[12866.76s -> 12867.60s]  Yep.
[12867.60s -> 12872.74s]  I'll make sure to tweet it so you know where it is.
[12872.74s -> 12875.50s]  Are you going to be cringe or funny?
[12875.50s -> 12876.74s]  I'm going to win.
[12876.74s -> 12887.66s]  I'm planning to win, guys.
[12887.66s -> 12892.29s]  Do you even buy household products?
[12892.29s -> 12897.92s]  No, I haven't bought cleaning supplies in 10 years.
[12897.92s -> 12899.84s]  I don't even know what aisle it's in.
[12899.84s -> 12908.42s]  What are you talking about?
[12908.42s -> 12915.02s]  All right, this is it.
[12915.02s -> 12916.10s]  Please don't embarrass us.
[12916.10s -> 12918.87s]  I'm going to.
[12918.87s -> 12921.03s]  You're going to be ashamed that you know this channel
[12921.03s -> 12929.46s]  after Thursday.
[12929.46s -> 12930.30s]  I just fall.
[12945.78s -> 12957.74s]  I like to clown ghosts, that's funny.
[12957.74s -> 12963.34s]  All right, what's the boss?
[12963.34s -> 12964.54s]  Oh, cool, it's the same song.
[12964.54s -> 12981.28s]  Oh, I thought you were actually happy about that.
[12981.28s -> 12990.33s]  How many songs did the original one have?
[12990.33s -> 12993.98s]  Oh my God.
[12993.98s -> 12995.26s]  All right, if I die one more time,
[12995.26s -> 12996.74s]  I'm changing to the van first.
[12996.74s -> 12998.22s]  Wait, did we even do a pole?
[12998.22s -> 12999.66s]  I completely forgot.
[12999.66s -> 13008.31s]  Did we run a pole?
[13008.31s -> 13037.87s]  So what happened?
[13037.87s -> 13040.28s]  Wow, I still died.
[13049.71s -> 13078.90s]  I'm so, I feel like my eyes just went frost.
[13078.90s -> 13098.14s]  Flutter to the end of the level.
[13098.14s -> 13100.41s]  Oh shit, I can't.
[13100.41s -> 13110.54s]  I'm not high enough.
[13110.54s -> 13112.62s]  It stopped, it actually stopped.
[13112.62s -> 13113.78s]  I didn't stop that.
[13113.78s -> 13118.81s]  That, I hit the limit.
[13118.81s -> 13119.97s]  That's quite the limit.
[13119.97s -> 13121.29s]  Why even have a limit?
[13121.33s -> 13123.94s]  Why is there a limit at that point?
[13123.94s -> 13149.67s]  Is it even necessary to have a limit?
[13149.67s -> 13152.47s]  All right, I just want to hear the clowns laugh.
[13156.66s -> 13157.54s]  Boss clown.
[13159.88s -> 13161.08s]  And then we'll move on.
[13168.39s -> 13176.80s]  No, I don't care, nevermind.
[13176.80s -> 13177.92s]  All right, what's this game called?
[13177.92s -> 13179.64s]  That was Pac-Man World, it was actually pretty fun.
[13179.64s -> 13181.04s]  It was actually a fun game.
[13181.04s -> 13183.13s]  I just, I don't care.
[13183.13s -> 13185.46s]  It was fun, it was enjoyable.
[13185.46s -> 13187.18s]  I think it was definitely worth playing.
