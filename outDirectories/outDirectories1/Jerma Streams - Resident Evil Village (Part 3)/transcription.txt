[2.55s -> 15.70s]  How are you? What's up? What's up? Hey, somebody said, why is he doing the DLC?
[16.82s -> 23.30s]  Yeah, I played the main game, the base game. I played it pretty much on launch.
[24.90s -> 31.62s]  Resident Evil Village DLC. That's what is on tap tonight.
[37.03s -> 44.92s]  Play Roblox. No, all of you people that are saying play Roblox.
[44.92s -> 48.12s]  You want to play Roblox. So when I go into a server,
[48.92s -> 55.74s]  6,000 of you will join that server and like throw rocks at me. No, I'm not going to play it.
[59.32s -> 63.08s]  You guys are all collectively going to go into the Roblox server I go into
[63.64s -> 79.58s]  and body block push me off of a cliff. And maybe I'll do it one day. I don't know. No,
[79.58s -> 84.46s]  not right now. It's Halloween. I'm going to play Roblox on Halloween. It's Halloween in a few days.
[85.02s -> 91.02s]  We're doing Resident Evil Village DLC. I've heard this is only a few hours.
[91.66s -> 96.02s]  We'll see how it goes. Another couple of hours. We'll see. And if I get to the end of this and
[96.02s -> 103.58s]  it's, you know, well, you say it's like three to four hours, but you're not accounting for the
[103.58s -> 108.62s]  amount of time that I'm going to stop and tell you in like a 15 minute conversation about the
[109.42s -> 115.96s]  my favorite Tabasco flavor, right? It's probably going to be a little longer than that. Which,
[115.96s -> 122.14s]  by the way, original red is fantastic. But I think a lot of people are sleeping on the green.
[122.78s -> 129.03s]  It's a little thicker. It's a little more like pickled, almost like jalapeno flavor.
[129.83s -> 133.43s]  The green is great. I think a lot of people are sleeping on it.
[133.43s -> 144.60s]  I'm not a big fan of the Chipotle one. No original green. Green looks like baby food.
[144.60s -> 152.74s]  Doesn't taste like baby food. Will you ever do chat picks a Diablo two skill tree again?
[154.87s -> 160.01s]  I don't own hardcore, right? That's what it was. What a weird group of streams that was.
[161.61s -> 174.78s]  I played hardcore Diablo two. That was weird. No, no, maybe they were fun. They were fun.
[175.34s -> 183.96s]  Let's go over a few things. So first of all, today we're streaming here for the, you know,
[183.96s -> 190.52s]  until we're done tomorrow. We're going to be streaming at 2pm. I'm trying to pull the streams
[190.52s -> 195.72s]  back because the internet problem has not been fixed. I did get in touch with the ISP and somebody
[195.72s -> 198.84s]  is going to, the technician is going to look into it. It's going to be whatever.
[199.72s -> 206.46s]  But at like 8pm Pacific, we might run into like an internet wormhole. So we're going to,
[206.46s -> 211.30s]  we're going to have to ride it out. If that happens, I'm trying to pull the streams back.
[211.30s -> 216.82s]  And yeah, I pulled it back 30 minutes today, but I really want to get started at like 1 to 2pm
[217.38s -> 225.83s]  permanently until that issue is solved. So we'll see. Cross your fingers. It doesn't happen,
[225.83s -> 233.30s]  but somebody is looking into it permanently. Internet wormhole. I don't know. Like we just
[233.30s -> 240.95s]  run into some weird route at like 8pm that makes my internet shit. Sometimes it's on my end.
[240.95s -> 247.59s]  Sometimes it's not. It's very strange. I don't know. Guys, there's just like wires and boxes
[249.10s -> 259.16s]  that are connecting all of us. I don't know. It's a bunch of wires and like electrical boxes.
[260.06s -> 268.09s]  It's pretty much magic. It pretty much is. If anybody were to ever come and conquer Earth,
[268.65s -> 272.46s]  I'm telling you, they're going to see all this shit underground. They're going to come here
[272.46s -> 276.42s]  for the gold. They're going to come here for the gold, but they're not going to understand
[276.42s -> 280.26s]  what the internet is. And they're going to see all these wires in the ground and be like, yeah,
[280.26s -> 284.18s]  dig all that up. That's not the gold, but that's what they really should have been looking for.
[286.57s -> 290.25s]  It's the infrastructure. It's the internet, right? Our communication ability.
[290.81s -> 297.43s]  And they're just going to go for the gold. Why would they want it? Does nobody get this?
[298.23s -> 301.91s]  Nobody gets this. Oh, the movie came out like 10 years ago. Nobody cares.
[304.10s -> 317.94s]  Nobody understands this, what I'm saying. Really? What? I don't want to say the movie
[317.94s -> 320.90s]  because I feel like people are going to be like, what the fuck, dude? I've never seen that movie.
[322.42s -> 328.39s]  People know what movie I'm talking about, right? Bro, chill. I'm fucking chill. What?
[328.39s -> 335.03s]  Don't tell me to chill. Who are you? Who is that person? I'm perfectly chilled out right now.
[335.51s -> 344.17s]  Dude, I was fine until you said that. If you haven't seen this movie in 10 years,
[344.17s -> 347.21s]  all right, then you're probably not going to see it. Or you'll probably, you've ever,
[347.21s -> 350.89s]  it's Avatar. You've all seen Avatar. Who has not seen Avatar in this chat?
[351.61s -> 355.45s]  There has to be nobody here. And they're coming out with like 10 more of them. So whatever.
[356.01s -> 364.86s]  You chill. You need to chill out. I'm chilling out right now. I, yeah,
[364.86s -> 377.13s]  spoiler alert for the movie Avatar that came out in like 2012. He's aging. Yeah, I am.
[377.13s -> 393.58s]  And I'm fine with it. What is it? Avatar is a movie that is about plugging in
[394.46s -> 400.23s]  and like being in another person's body. It's been a long time. I haven't seen it in a long time.
[400.23s -> 404.23s]  All I know is that there's like metal in the earth or in their earth. Whatever. I don't,
[404.23s -> 413.27s]  oh wait, I'm done. What is it called? Unobtanium. The movie was fine. That was,
[413.27s -> 420.25s]  I thought it was entertaining. It was fine. I thought it was cool. Dude, relax. All right.
[420.97s -> 424.66s]  You can't tell me to relax when I'm about to play like a horror game. And in Resident Evil
[424.66s -> 432.98s]  Village is it a horror game? It kind of is. Anyways, welcome everybody. We're going to turn
[432.98s -> 438.42s]  on Resident Evil Village's DLC. This is where you play as Rose. It literally came out today.
[442.42s -> 446.12s]  I also have another thing to talk about, but I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait
[446.12s -> 449.88s]  until there are enough people here. I don't want to say it until enough people are here.
[451.02s -> 460.73s]  Wait. Once we have all of you are here, we'll tell you something. It's very good DLC. That's
[460.73s -> 474.15s]  good to know. NK is not enough. My thing doesn't say 10K. My thing doesn't say that. Has it not
[474.15s -> 488.49s]  updated? Well, just wait. Wait like 10 minutes. Do we need to take a roll call? Okay. Roll call.
[488.49s -> 505.83s]  Who's here? Are you here? Say, present. You guys ready for the village? We're going to have to
[505.83s -> 511.00s]  adjust the audio, I think. All right. So is it good? I'll put two headphones in. All right.
[511.00s -> 513.32s]  Shadows of Rose. I got to remember how to play this game. I don't remember how to play.
[514.74s -> 518.84s]  This is new content. This came out literally today. Apparently it's pretty good.
[519.48s -> 533.59s]  It's a short campaign. Looking forward to it. Are you ready? Here it comes. You look like you're
[533.59s -> 563.74s]  from LA Noir. What do you think? Dude, you're going to play it all up. Hey, K. Sorry I'm late.
[563.74s -> 569.11s]  It's okay. I'm just enjoying the day. You said you had something important to tell me.
[569.75s -> 573.51s]  I hope it's not about Chris wanting me to join his operation because
[573.51s -> 578.62s]  I already told him that's not happening. I see what he puts you and the rest of his
[578.62s -> 585.72s]  hound wolf squad through. No thank you. It's not about that. It is about you.
[585.72s -> 595.45s]  Play the new Call of Duty or else. Stop talking during the movie. How are things at school?
[596.65s -> 600.65s]  Seriously? That's what you wanted to talk to me about? That group of mean girls still
[601.45s -> 608.42s]  hassling you? You mean are they still treating me like a freak? Hey, uh-uh. Look at me.
[608.42s -> 618.52s]  You are not a freak. I am. No I am. That's why I keep my distance from everybody at school.
[619.61s -> 630.04s]  They knew what I really was. So you don't have any friends that you can talk to? Who is this?
[630.04s -> 636.76s]  Talk to? About what? How I'm hardly even human? How I'm some kind of horrendous monster?
[637.72s -> 646.26s]  Hey, it's okay. I hardly ever murder my friends. What if there were a way to get rid of your powers?
[646.98s -> 657.72s]  And get rid of them in a heartbeat. Get rid of them? All right. Well, I think there's something I need
[657.72s -> 665.72s]  to show you. Get rid of your powers? We already know about Miranda and the mutimized heat. How
[665.72s -> 671.64s]  she researched it obsessively and performed experiments on human subjects. Like me? Exactly.
[672.60s -> 677.16s]  Uh, what you don't know is that we recently found some of her research.
[677.16s -> 682.60s]  Apparently she discovered a purifying crystal that can remove the mutimized heat from a toast.
[683.72s -> 687.72s]  Purifying crystal? If we can get our hands on one of these we might be able to weaken or
[688.36s -> 695.64s]  remove your powers entirely. Are you kidding me? No, no, but her notes are incomplete. However,
[695.64s -> 699.96s]  I wouldn't want to get rid of all of them. I think I have an idea where we can find the rest of her
[699.96s -> 710.89s]  research. Let's do it. Let's find it. Where is it? In there. What? You just have to, uh, you just
[710.89s -> 716.49s]  have to drink that. Stores memories from people who pass away in close proximity, including Miranda
[716.49s -> 722.33s]  and everything she knows. Be careful, it smells like puke. You might be able to solve the mystery
[722.33s -> 725.69s]  of the purifying crystal. Wait, what do you mean enter its consciousness?
[725.69s -> 737.54s]  Yes. Okay, so you, your deep connection will allow you to explore the information within.
[741.05s -> 747.69s]  That sounds crazy. You sound crazy. Yes, yes, yes, Rose, but not dangerous.
[748.57s -> 752.41s]  Right? Think of it just like walking through somebody else's memories.
[753.77s -> 756.49s]  You really think this can work? I think it's worth trying.
[757.45s -> 765.75s]  What do you have to lose? It's just going to be like, how do I even do this in red Kool-Aid like
[765.75s -> 781.90s]  molasses? I don't know. Try reaching out to it. It's Halloween, Rose. Okay. Fine. What the hell?
[788.22s -> 804.50s]  It's reacting. Rose is so weird. Yeah, it's like she sees things that aren't there.
[805.30s -> 814.50s]  Creepy. What? Imagine wanting to be friends with her. Why would you not want to be friends
[814.50s -> 835.80s]  with a person that has fucking superpowers? Are you out of your mind? She's weird. Okay. She has
[836.68s -> 849.61s]  like Avengers level superpowers. Don't. I'm still here. Okay. Okay. Where are you?
[850.25s -> 862.92s]  If Captain America walked in the room, would they go, oh, he's weird. What's her superpower?
[866.09s -> 873.53s]  Super strength? She could have bugs come out of her hands or something. I don't know. With something.
[873.53s -> 882.10s]  What is it? It's mold. She has like powerful mold bugs. She has powerful mold that can
[883.62s -> 891.61s]  she could do like a venom arm like that can come out. Okay. Well, anyways, hi, I'm back. So let's
[891.61s -> 898.18s]  play. Miranda's research claims that the mega my seat preserves the memories of people who
[898.18s -> 903.64s]  passed away within its area of influence, absorbing them into its own vast consciousness. We also know
[903.64s -> 908.36s]  based on our previous encounters with the mold that people who are contaminated with the meta
[910.04s -> 916.78s]  what is that word spelled out phonetically for me? Meta my seat. I was gonna say meta mucil.
[918.38s -> 925.74s]  How is it? Whatever. All right. So you get on this mold network. So there's a mold network. If we
[925.74s -> 930.46s]  extrapolate from this, we can summarize that subjects with a strong affinity to the meta my
[930.46s -> 935.50s]  seat should be able to use the network to connect to the memories of the dead within the mega
[936.06s -> 941.38s]  my seat. It should be possible to verify this theory using the lab's mega my seat sample we
[941.38s -> 946.54s]  collected 16 years ago. We just need a suitable subject with a proven connection to the mold.
[946.54s -> 951.51s]  It's a network. Unfortunately, this presents a problem. Our organization's policies prevent us
[951.51s -> 958.06s]  from directly contacting civilians who are infected with muta my seat. Certainly, the ethical reasoning
[958.06s -> 962.78s]  is understandable, but it has rendered the confirmation of this theory impossible. It pains
[962.78s -> 966.70s]  me to think of how much mankind could stand to benefit from this preservation and indexing of
[966.70s -> 972.01s]  human consciousness, the possibilities of preserving or even reclaiming great minds. Perhaps there's
[972.01s -> 983.72s]  some way of cutting through the red tape. Okay. Why is this in third person game? Why is it in third
[983.72s -> 996.54s]  person? Did I pick third person? It's they just added it. Yeah, but is this is the DLC third person?
[997.02s -> 1025.22s]  Wait. Yes. Wait. What? Explore. Wait, what's in here? I can't. I don't think I can do it. It's too scary.
[1025.86s -> 1039.66s]  Okay, this is so imagine you get like locked in this place. Like you got teleported to this place.
[1040.30s -> 1048.20s]  I really think the John Jingleheimer Schmidt routine would actually benefit you. It really would
[1048.20s -> 1056.98s]  because I mean, look, at some point, like you're you're you're fucked here. You know what I mean?
[1057.38s -> 1063.96s]  What are you gonna do? No, I would just barrel down this hallway screaming John Jingleheimer
[1063.96s -> 1067.56s]  Schmidt and just throwing stuff around and like dancing and making like weird sound effects. I
[1067.56s -> 1070.52s]  think they'd be like, what the fuck is going on? Send this guy back out. We want somebody that's
[1070.52s -> 1074.54s]  like scared. We want somebody that's like, like, no, we don't want we don't want this guy. This
[1074.54s -> 1090.36s]  guy's fucked up. Okay. What are you out? Okay. So it was from the last stream. It's a reference.
[1094.18s -> 1102.18s]  You need to out psycho the psycho. Just do the routine. We're like, are you not locked in here
[1102.18s -> 1108.26s]  with me? I'm locked in here with you. The other way around. It's me. You need to be afraid. Yeah,
[1108.26s -> 1128.84s]  just start screaming that right? What is this? Oh, it's a shoe. Have I rotated? Oh, or just pull
[1128.84s -> 1137.37s]  the routine, the routine on them. Just find a really echoey part of this castle and just do
[1137.37s -> 1146.28s]  their routine, you know, just sit there and just kind of go like they'll be like this. I'm supposed
[1146.28s -> 1152.66s]  to be doing that. Why are they doing that? It would just mess them all up. It would just walk
[1152.66s -> 1167.48s]  them up. Let me know. Okay, that's actually kind of scary. Oh, this is a memory. Anything I can do?
[1169.18s -> 1180.79s]  Is someone there? Dangerous here. What is? Why? Hang tight. I'm gonna see if I can find a key.
[1182.65s -> 1192.10s]  What? No, we don't know who's in there. That's such a Dark Souls room, by the way.
[1194.30s -> 1198.14s]  Talk through the door to like the weirdo. And am I just going to open the door?
[1211.10s -> 1223.43s]  Okay, let me find a key. Do I have a map? Probably not. Not yet. Mirrors. What is that? Okay,
[1223.43s -> 1239.37s]  we're good. What's on it? Stop it from moving. Because it's weird and creepy. Yeah, it's creepy.
[1243.58s -> 1260.47s]  Is there a key? I feel like someone's going to be in this room now. Oh, that's okay. That's my name.
[1260.47s -> 1261.83s]  I thought that was a cake for a second.
[1262.31s -> 1274.23s]  Me! Fucking YouTuber. It's still in me. It's still there, by the way. I used to be a YouTuber,
[1274.23s -> 1286.44s]  okay? Years and years ago. What's this say? To create art, simply add to the rabbit's carcasses.
[1286.44s -> 1295.75s]  Decay is not an issue. Spruce them up a bit with makeup. It makes them seem more alive. Ah, all
[1295.75s -> 1302.31s]  right. Find the crystal. Find the key to the cell. Explore your surroundings. So I'm currently
[1302.31s -> 1309.70s]  searching this area. I gotta view files in the journal. All right. Did the guy draw a picture
[1309.70s -> 1321.24s]  of himself? Oh no, I did. Pretty good artist. Okay, all right, all right, all right. Why did
[1321.24s -> 1329.72s]  I think he did that? Maybe he handed me these notes just in case you forget who it is. It's me.
[1329.72s -> 1334.86s]  Honestly, this almost looks like, this almost looks like she held the paper up to his face
[1335.42s -> 1346.65s]  and shaded with a pencil. Like, that's how this picture came to be. Does that make any sense?
[1346.65s -> 1350.41s]  Those things are cool, by the way. It's like a little, all right, whatever. All right,
[1350.41s -> 1355.99s]  so where do I need to go? I need to go, I already went that way. I did not go up to the top left. So
[1355.99s -> 1367.42s]  let's just check to make sure there's nothing else here. Uh-huh, this way. I don't have any weapons.
[1367.42s -> 1409.75s]  Is there a gun? Oh god. Okay, there's the key. Don't step in that. Can I not step in it? Okay,
[1409.75s -> 1417.35s]  I gotta sell key. I don't have any items. All right. Um, can I step in that or is it gonna hurt me?
[1418.07s -> 1426.31s]  I guess I can go this way. Do I die if I step in that? I think I die if I touch that.
[1428.79s -> 1445.14s]  Okay, just don't. It's in here, right? No, where is it? This way. Something's gonna break through
[1445.14s -> 1471.21s]  this door. Left? Okay, yep. How do I sprint? All right, it's right here. I think I need to make
[1471.21s -> 1500.52s]  the game a little brighter. Who's in here? Watch out. Whatever it is, it's alive.
[1514.22s -> 1548.66s]  It's you. It's me. Literally me. That doesn't help. That doesn't help. Well, I mean, if we're
[1548.66s -> 1552.58s]  together, we may as well harmonize John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. I think it would sound
[1552.58s -> 1564.47s]  better. John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. It'd be fucking sick. Yeah, well, I could do the high
[1564.47s -> 1581.03s]  part as long as you can do the low part. What are you doing? Oh, there's a way to sneak. Okay.
[1585.16s -> 1589.48s]  She's you. She can't do the low part. Oh, that's right. I didn't think about that.
[1602.17s -> 1625.72s]  Get in there. Someone's gonna jump out. Oh, okay. What's going on? What's wrong?
[1625.72s -> 1635.11s]  There's another one? Quick, quick, quick before she dies. John Jacob Jingleheimer. That's all right.
[1635.11s -> 1646.10s]  Never mind. I can do the low part. Why are there so many roses? Don't press any buttons.
[1650.50s -> 1656.65s]  Hey, are you listening to me? What are we looking for? Find the switch handle.
[1663.50s -> 1666.22s]  All right. I need the handle. We need to find the handle. Do you have a handle
[1670.06s -> 1675.26s]  on the ground over here? Can I? Is it just there? Can I touch it? No. All right. I need a handle
[1677.29s -> 1686.94s]  this way. Switch handles missing. Okay. Find that handle. Go deeper. What does this mean?
[1686.94s -> 1697.99s]  Oh, I can go up here. I locked in here. No, I'm going to go. I'm going to go this way first.
[1697.99s -> 1709.11s]  This looks interesting. Okay. That wasn't anything. That was an exit. Something's going to
[1709.11s -> 1714.71s]  chase. Something's going to chase us around here without a doubt. That's definitely a way to escape
[1714.71s -> 1732.26s]  when a monster comes out here and attacks. All right. Let's sneak down there. I have a light,
[1732.26s -> 1748.73s]  right? Yeah. Okay. This that way. Wait, what's the map look like? All right. What was that?
[1753.05s -> 1765.88s]  What the fuck is that sound? Oh, this is behind where? Oh, this is these all me.
[1770.78s -> 1775.58s]  So many bodies. This one looks rendered. It's going to this one's rendered. You know what I'm
[1775.58s -> 1780.63s]  saying? When I meet what I said, this isn't like a 3D rendered model. I'm telling you,
[1780.63s -> 1797.53s]  it's going to stand up. Nothing here. Ah, I'm telling you, these are rendered 3D models.
[1798.25s -> 1810.74s]  Anybody have a key? Nobody has a key. You don't have like the key or like on you somewhere.
[1811.46s -> 1831.86s]  Okay. Well, it's not here. I can't honestly, I've gotten jumpier in the last five years. I
[1831.86s -> 1838.46s]  really have. I told you they were fucking rendered. They were rendered 3D models. I told you
[1839.10s -> 1854.70s]  they literally rendered models. They've rendered 3D models. Okay. Unlock this. All right. We're
[1854.70s -> 1909.88s]  okay. Straight right left. I want I've run button so bad. You have no idea. Oh, what the fuck? Oh,
[1909.88s -> 1920.22s]  what are her powers then? Fucking electric hands. Are you kidding me? Just like force hands.
[1920.94s -> 1930.73s]  Oh shit. Why? Escape the monsters. All right. Press it. Press the button quick.
[1936.06s -> 1943.66s]  Oh shit. I'm sorry. Oh my God. They're coming from every angle. How do I get out of here?
[1949.66s -> 1984.66s]  Open up. Hurry. Oh, God damn it. Oh, geez. Okay. We're good. All right. Here comes
[1993.35s -> 2004.60s]  an invisible wall. Wait, can I go that way? I don't care. Excuse me. I have to go back. Um, how?
[2006.79s -> 2016.50s]  Huh? There's no way to go. I can't get out of here. I'm trapped. Get the fuck out of the way.
[2016.50s -> 2020.50s]  How do I slide? Is there a slide button? This is probably a slide button, right?
[2024.20s -> 2031.21s]  How do I get out of here? Get out of the way. You're blocking the entrance. This is not fair.
[2031.21s -> 2035.21s]  Get out of the way. You've blocked the entrance. It's not fair. I got by.
[2038.65s -> 2058.71s]  I'm so fucked up. Am I going to make it this way? This way? Okay. All right. I made it.
[2060.73s -> 2067.05s]  Oh my God. They were blocking the entrance. That wasn't fair. All right. There's only one way to go.
[2067.05s -> 2080.54s]  Did I heal? Crouch and press Q to do a spin move. You made that up. There's no spin move.
[2084.23s -> 2091.66s]  There is no spin move. Talking about like, like zangief, like go, go, go, go, go. You
[2091.66s -> 2119.69s]  spin with the fists out. No, you okay? What are you? I'm the narrator, not enemy friend.
[2119.69s -> 2131.03s]  What were those things? What is happening here? Leave now. What is this? Where am I?
[2131.75s -> 2143.10s]  Hell. Come on, write it. Go while you can. Not until I get this out of my body. There's a crystal
[2143.10s -> 2149.85s]  here that will remove the mold. I need to find it and I'm not leaving until I do.
[2150.57s -> 2167.85s]  You're dangerous. Who are you? My guardian angel? Sure. That's funny. Do you have a name? If you're
[2167.85s -> 2193.11s]  an angel, then Gabriel, Michael. Michael. Okay. Michael, what now? Dangerous here. Move. Who's
[2193.11s -> 2213.93s]  Michael? Okay. Where even am I? Okay. Oh, wait. There is a typewriter. Very cool. Game is saved.
[2213.93s -> 2225.27s]  First aid. Yep. All right. Open inventory. I remember this. You can medicine that heals all
[2225.27s -> 2234.57s]  wounds. Uh, isn't there a quick way to do it? There's a quick heal somehow, right? You can make
[2234.57s -> 2240.73s]  healing items too, from my understanding. I played the game. I, of course I understand it.
[2240.73s -> 2247.59s]  Why are you so wide today? I'm not. I'm gonna call it my hairline, a parallelogram. What does that
[2247.59s -> 2283.53s]  mean? These poor things. So it's, it's the Duke, right? Yeah. I saw the trailer. So what is, is
[2283.53s -> 2300.10s]  the Duke a bad guy? I thought he was a good guy. I thought he, I thought he helped us. It's like we
[2300.10s -> 2312.23s]  caught another. Lively now, aren't you? You should have put that effort into running. It would have
[2312.23s -> 2322.63s]  made the chase that much more thrilling. Let me go. Let me go. It would seem this little rabbit lacks
[2322.63s -> 2337.11s]  the necessary fortitude. You had shown a little grit and actually escaped. That purifying crystal
[2337.11s -> 2353.50s]  would now be yours. The crystal. Oh, now we have a new little rabbit to pursue. Let's see how fast
[2353.58s -> 2365.64s]  this one is. I love this actor. He's great. Okay. I'm back and I'm ready to run.
[2367.80s -> 2385.69s]  There's a lot. Um, wait a minute. Okay. Where do I go? I can't open that. Dude. Oh my God. Okay.
[2385.69s -> 2401.13s]  All right. What? Oh, come on. What the hell? A way out.
[2411.82s -> 2426.70s]  Um, back this way. I need to. Oh, all right. We're good. Need weapon. Gun.
[2430.22s -> 2442.74s]  Seriously. Where am I going to get a gun? Touch my words. What? Like this?
[2448.26s -> 2452.50s]  Okay. Well, if you didn't manifest me a rocket launcher in the first 10 minutes of the game,
[2452.50s -> 2486.25s]  here we go. Point and shoot. Who is this tutorial text? Okay. His bullets. Third person is back. So
[2486.25s -> 2498.47s]  what's going on here? Can I shoot? Should I shoot this? Do the spin move? Okay. It's just,
[2498.55s -> 2501.75s]  all right. I get it. Actually, that's a good, that's actually good for me to know.
[2508.92s -> 2519.50s]  Acquire the crystal. All right. I can't go down here. No, I can't. Right. Okay. So that means,
[2519.50s -> 2527.32s]  where have I not gone? Straight through here. There's a door over this way. There's the crystal
[2527.32s -> 2539.22s]  right there. There it is. Just take it. A large crystal is glowing with a pale blue light. The
[2539.22s -> 2543.94s]  disciples await their masks. Bronze, silver, gold with their, I guess I need to find these
[2543.94s -> 2550.17s]  masks to unlock it. Okay. With their garb array, the light shall be released. We need three masks
[2550.81s -> 2562.63s]  to release the crystal. Okay. You got it. Shoot it. Shoot the glass. Not that easy. It's not that
[2562.63s -> 2576.82s]  simple. Check out grottobeast.com. Grottobeast.com. Not enough people here. I can talk about it.
[2576.82s -> 2585.22s]  So, grottobeast.com is available right now. This, the website's not there. This is literally just a
[2585.22s -> 2591.53s]  placeholder. But what is there is for you to drop an email. This is, this is going to the merch
[2591.53s -> 2600.41s]  company. .net also works too. .com redirects .net is there. Yep. You can put your email in,
[2600.41s -> 2609.26s]  which will go to our fulfillment company to decide if you are interested in this product.
[2609.26s -> 2617.13s]  Grottobeast.com. That must mean it must be coming soon. The website is a placeholder.
[2617.13s -> 2623.66s]  We're only trying to see how many people are interested because what's grottobeasts?
[2624.90s -> 2632.18s]  Oh, we got a lot to tell you. So, grottobeast.com is a trading card game. It's been in development
[2632.18s -> 2636.65s]  for about a year and a half. Fake fan. That's not a fake fan. I mean, you could have been
[2636.65s -> 2648.55s]  started watching like six months ago, a month ago. New viewer Andy. But we're trying to see
[2648.55s -> 2653.42s]  the fulfillment company wants to kind of know how many people are interested because we need
[2653.42s -> 2659.99s]  to figure out how many we need to make to, you know, preliminarily. So, if you're interested,
[2659.99s -> 2668.04s]  drop it there. It's not, no, it's a physical card. It's not digital. We're trying to garner
[2668.04s -> 2677.86s]  some interest and see how it is. It's really fucking cool. There are 200 cards. It's a bunch
[2677.86s -> 2687.27s]  of characters from this universe as well as Grottobeasts. It's 200 fucking cards. It is an,
[2688.07s -> 2698.73s]  it's an enormous project. It is a game. There are 15 artists that have participated. I'm one of
[2698.73s -> 2711.10s]  them. That's right. I'm one of them. Physical NFTs. So, we're trying, what I really want to do is I
[2711.10s -> 2718.20s]  want to make sure that whoever wants them can get them. So, we really have no idea how many we need
[2718.20s -> 2724.10s]  to make first. I don't want to have it be a case where there's like some odd hundred or some odd
[2724.10s -> 2730.01s]  thousand amount of people that want them, but I don't, we don't make enough, right, in this first
[2730.01s -> 2737.90s]  pass. This is a huge project that has been, it's essentially like a gigantic community love letter,
[2737.90s -> 2744.36s]  essentially. It's tons of references to streams. There's tons of original characters that have
[2744.36s -> 2749.50s]  been created by all the artists. It's, it's really, really cool. Will it ship to the EU? Of course,
[2749.50s -> 2759.56s]  absolutely. This is not NA only. How much to ship international? These are questions that I do not
[2759.56s -> 2766.95s]  have the answer to right now. All, all this is, that placeholder website is just there to just get
[2766.95s -> 2772.23s]  an idea for the fulfillment company, how many people might actually be interested, and we're
[2772.23s -> 2780.18s]  going to go from there. Yeah, Holly had a huge amount to do with this, as well as all the other
[2780.18s -> 2785.85s]  artists, and obviously all the other people that worked on it. It's been a big undertaking,
[2785.85s -> 2791.16s]  and it looks, it's fucking awesome, I'm telling you. There's a whole game. We have contracted out a
[2791.16s -> 2796.25s]  game designer to make this whole thing. It's actually really fucking fun. It's actually fun.
[2796.25s -> 2806.89s]  It's very fun. Tweet the website, you monster. Yeah, so how it's going to work, because it's a
[2806.89s -> 2812.41s]  game, we want to make sure that, because there'll be packs you can buy, right? Just booster packs.
[2812.41s -> 2818.49s]  But, did you, wait, did you actually call me a monster or not? So besides these booster packs,
[2818.49s -> 2826.30s]  we're going to sell a kit, like a starter kit, to make sure monster packs? What did I say? Did
[2826.30s -> 2837.61s]  I just say monster packs? No, I said booster packs, right? Yeah, there's going to be holographics.
[2837.61s -> 2843.19s]  There's going to be all the shit that you are used to, right? But there's going to be a starter
[2843.19s -> 2847.50s]  kit that's going to be two full decks, so you don't have to worry about it. You can just buy it,
[2847.50s -> 2851.46s]  and if you want it, and have it. But we also thought it would be fun to have these booster
[2851.46s -> 2856.90s]  packs where you can open them and get like, oh my god, I got a, I got a, I got like a holographic
[2856.90s -> 2866.97s]  bugleberry. He's a card, by the way. And price point-wise, I don't want to, this is going to be
[2866.97s -> 2873.80s]  something that I want to make sure is affordable, right? I don't want to do a thing where, oh yeah,
[2873.80s -> 2879.69s]  the card packs are fucking unbelievably egregious. No, no, it's not going to happen.
[2879.69s -> 2885.16s]  I don't know what the price is going to be, but we're going to try to keep it reasonable.
[2885.16s -> 2891.21s]  This is essentially just really interesting, a really interesting merch project that came about
[2891.21s -> 2900.62s]  a year and a half ago after that stream. And we're finally almost ready to start showing it off.
[2900.62s -> 2908.47s]  So, if it's a success, awesome. If it's not a success, it was fun to do. I just really hope
[2908.47s -> 2914.25s]  you guys think they're cool. That's all I care about. It's just, are these cool? Is it fun merch?
[2914.25s -> 2922.10s]  Is the game fun? And the answer to those questions, I think, are all yes. So grottobeast.com,
[2922.10s -> 2929.43s]  grottobeast.net. If you have any interest, please just fill out your email so you can be notified
[2929.43s -> 2935.96s]  when it happens and we can figure out how much we need to make. Is auto a card? Yes, there are 200
[2935.96s -> 2943.67s]  cards. And the starter deck, Holly, if you're here, do we know how many cards are in the starter deck?
[2943.67s -> 2948.39s]  Like, the starter kit that you can get that has two full decks and all of the materials you need.
[2948.39s -> 2965.94s]  Do we know how many cards are in the starter? Do we have any idea? So, well, let me get this
[2965.94s -> 2972.20s]  accurate, but it's going to be, if you don't want to buy boosters and you just want, like,
[2972.20s -> 2979.02s]  I believe the two decks have 41 cards each. Okay. So, you're going to be able to enjoy it if you
[2979.02s -> 2985.14s]  don't want to just buy boosters, which I also want to try to do this meaningfully and have it
[2985.14s -> 2993.91s]  be like orders, right? Rather than have it sell out as like, all right, that's it. We sold 1,500
[2993.91s -> 2999.40s]  copies. Goodbye. It's over. It's limited. No, I don't want it to be limited in the sense that
[2999.96s -> 3006.04s]  it's deliberately limited. So, deliberately not as many people that want it can get it.
[3006.04s -> 3015.05s]  There you go. Just go ask her. She's in your house. I'm like speaking into the air.
[3015.61s -> 3024.98s]  How many cards are in each deck? Do we know? Yeah. We're just trying to get some interest,
[3024.98s -> 3030.02s]  and that's it. I hope you enjoy it when it actually does come out. It's been a pretty long project,
[3031.75s -> 3039.00s]  which I will tell you, after spending the last year plus overseeing the development and being
[3039.00s -> 3046.71s]  part of a card game, it's a lot. The artists have spent a ton of time working on it. The game
[3046.71s -> 3053.00s]  designer has put tons of tons of love into it. I'm just excited for you to get in your hands.
[3053.00s -> 3065.03s]  So, that was the announcement for today. What if nobody's interested? Well, and oh well,
[3065.03s -> 3075.00s]  it was fun to do it. Yeah, we've been waiting for the time to be able to tell people because
[3075.00s -> 3079.32s]  if you saw the Grotto Beast banner on the baseball stream was kind of there, and it's like, hey,
[3079.32s -> 3094.95s]  look, this thing's still a thing. Okay, it's okay, man. I'll buy it. If you are interested
[3094.95s -> 3104.30s]  and you think it's cool, then yeah, I hope when you get it, I hope it's high quality.
[3104.86s -> 3109.42s]  I hope you enjoy it. We're trying to make it as good quality and price point, right? I look,
[3109.42s -> 3116.97s]  I'm trying. I'm going to catch them all. Why did I just say that out loud? You're going to collect
[3116.97s -> 3125.62s]  all the cards. Whatever. All right, so let's keep going. So I have to go to find the three masks,
[3125.62s -> 3140.30s]  which is I have not been through here yet. I have eight shots. Ooh, shotgun. I need a key.
[3140.94s -> 3159.88s]  Grant me that which sees the truth through its three eyes. I need a big key. I'm never going to
[3159.88s -> 3175.48s]  open this. Cut the chain. Okay, this is where the chain is. I need like a pair of pliers, right?
[3175.48s -> 3179.86s]  Should I shoot enemies or should I just say bullets till the end of the game and then
[3179.86s -> 3192.92s]  shoot the boss with 150 handgun rounds? Did I turn the flashlight off? Do I have a flashlight?
[3194.41s -> 3209.88s]  Okay. Yeah, I. All right. How many shots does it take? You take way too many shots.
[3219.78s -> 3228.47s]  Oh, also there are two streams that I'm trying to do before the year ends. Two big ones,
[3228.47s -> 3241.80s]  two of them. Why do I like I needed to pause for that, by the way. Ooh, cutters. I do have some
[3241.80s -> 3253.26s]  very sad news. That is a bad reverse announcement. I did tease. I did tease that Mr. Green's had
[3253.26s -> 3260.74s]  something in the pipeline and I got a phone call from Mr. Green's and he backed out. Mr. Green's
[3260.74s -> 3266.02s]  is backed out. He told me to go fuck myself. That was literally his exact words. He thought it was
[3266.02s -> 3274.01s]  he thought it was a dumb project. He said no. So I was like, OK, that stream is no longer currently
[3274.01s -> 3290.02s]  in development. I have to say there are two others that currently are. So don't worry over here.
[3290.02s -> 3294.50s]  What was it? I don't want to say because if for some reason I actually do go through with it,
[3295.75s -> 3300.79s]  then if you really want to help, you could back me up against those things. Are you spawning in
[3300.79s -> 3317.14s]  ammo? So I'm on my own. Thanks for the ammo. You spawned one small ammo box, just spawn a huge
[3317.14s -> 3322.02s]  detonator or something. You know what I mean? Like, well, spawn a bunch of C4 throughout this
[3322.02s -> 3330.87s]  whole place and then let me. What are you talking? Why are you doing this? OK, I need I got the
[3330.87s -> 3339.86s]  bolt cutters, which was over here. Right. You can't dodge a battle. Yes, I fucking can. I'm
[3339.86s -> 3353.08s]  so sick of seeing people write that. I'll prove it. Don't worry. Oh, this is the same place. So
[3353.08s -> 3366.14s]  what is this? What is this thing? There's a gross lumpy thing growing here. Wasted a bullet. Right.
[3366.14s -> 3374.81s]  There's got to be some serum I pour on that. Right. OK, I'm looking for the shotgun key.
[3379.83s -> 3385.11s]  You can combine or urban chem fluid is a healing potion. Right. And then chem fluid and gunpowder
[3385.11s -> 3391.99s]  is bullets. Right. Refresh my memory is one of these big things you want to do. Dodging a battle
[3391.99s -> 3412.18s]  axe. It's trapped core. You mean that gross lumpy thing? How am I supposed to break it?
[3414.10s -> 3429.45s]  Use your powers. My powers. I literally came here to get rid of them. Only way. OK, fine. But how?
[3430.33s -> 3437.91s]  What am I supposed to do? I need an amplifier. Sorry, I'm biting my lip. What's that?
[3438.71s -> 3453.38s]  I need to get an amplifier that way. Why is it a battle axe? Why not just a regular axe?
[3453.38s -> 3459.32s]  Because that's not what I said. I said a battle axe. I'm very confident in my ability to do
[3460.04s -> 3470.42s]  just what I described. OK, so I have to find an amplifier to use my powers on these
[3470.42s -> 3485.32s]  plant things to get rid of them. Any ammo? OK, so those are obviously
[3486.39s -> 3495.29s]  just scattered around the world here. All right. This is by the way, this is a fully 3D
[3495.29s -> 3520.55s]  rendered model. It's standing up. Gunpowder. Nice. If you always want to tell if an enemy is going
[3520.55s -> 3526.98s]  to stand up or not, just look for like the aliasing, right? If something in the environment
[3526.98s -> 3558.81s]  has aliasing, it's standing up. Yep. Look at the hair. I see the aliasing. Cam fluid. I can use
[3558.81s -> 3565.06s]  these things and combine them. There might be more items to combine. I'm going to save it. I don't
[3565.06s -> 3575.46s]  really need it for now. All right. The tutorial wants me to do it, so I'll just do it. So where
[3575.46s -> 3585.46s]  are we going here? All right. I can go this way or that way. This way. That way. Come on, Gwyn.
[3585.46s -> 3637.35s]  That thing's standing up. How are you not dead? I shot you. OK. All right. We're good. Is that
[3637.35s -> 3659.69s]  gunpowder? Somebody's going to jump off from behind a curtain. I don't have any bullets. OK.
[3659.69s -> 3670.92s]  I need bullets like right now. Oh, do I have a knife or anything? I don't have a knife. Oh,
[3670.92s -> 3676.25s]  come on. All right. I just got to run. Did I get what I needed from here? Oh,
[3676.25s -> 3689.99s]  cam fluid. Eight bullets. Is this the thing I'm looking for? Is this a stove? What is this?
[3690.63s -> 3706.39s]  It's a pizza oven. It looks like the lady from Beauty and the Beast. What's that? That's the
[3706.39s -> 3720.52s]  lady at the big bureau. The cabinet. What is the cabinet from Beauty and the Beast? The teapot.
[3720.52s -> 3725.64s]  There's no cabinet in Beauty and the Beast? Is there a huge cabinet in Beauty and the Beast?
[3729.77s -> 3737.14s]  There is. Yeah. No, there is. The wardrobe. The bureau. OK. Sorry. Whatever. Yeah. This is
[3737.14s -> 3750.25s]  the Mandela effect. You're thinking of the straight to VHS sequel. No way I'm waiting
[3750.25s -> 3768.22s]  through that. Can I like step on this stuff? It's a ladder here. OK, let's go. The wardrobe. OK.
[3768.22s -> 3781.82s]  Yeah, it is. It is. Wait, this character was actually not in the regular movie. I think I'm
[3781.82s -> 3813.91s]  combining the teapot and the wardrobe into one character. OK. The wardrobe is in the movie,
[3813.91s -> 3835.06s]  but I don't think wardrobe talks. Really? Yes, she does. Am I missing like important stuff
[3835.06s -> 3848.28s]  because I'm just looking at off screen and climbing a ladder. I think we're good.
[3848.28s -> 3856.54s]  OK, stop turning the flashlight off. Yeah, keep it on. No, stop. Don't keep that flashlight on.
[3856.54s -> 3879.77s]  Why would you turn it off in a dark, scary house? OK. Oh, something happened here.
[3886.87s -> 3910.70s]  He's oozing. Am I? I shouldn't be. This. The juice box. OK. I have found a means of dramatically
[3910.70s -> 3916.22s]  destabilizing parts of the mutamycete network by introducing a disruptive force to block the
[3916.22s -> 3922.58s]  auto-inducers they use for communication. For example, the hard-packed cores of mold known as
[3923.30s -> 3930.87s]  slerotia begin to break down on a cellular level and disintegrate when this is disrupted.
[3930.87s -> 3938.20s]  Slerotia form when the mutamycete develops in new locations, serving as sort of an anchor point or
[3938.20s -> 3943.34s]  a foothold. They're often associated with a patch of liquid void for which the mold has spread.
[3943.34s -> 3949.16s]  When the auto-inducers of the slerotia are disrupted, it begins to break down. Any liquid
[3949.16s -> 3956.28s]  void connected to the slerotia will also disintegrate. The moths are putting pictures of
[3956.28s -> 3963.58s]  the wardrobe and they're contemplating if the clothes inside are the organs and guts and shit.
[3963.58s -> 3971.29s]  I just looked, I'm sorry, it fucked me up. It would appear that destabilizing the slerotia
[3971.29s -> 3977.03s]  sends a signal indicating that the location is no longer viable for mutamycete. Habitation.
[3977.11s -> 3996.18s]  triggering a full-scale retreat or why can i just take these okay so there's the power uh
[3996.18s -> 4009.27s]  increaser yes all right rw variant flask one actually looks good so what am i supposed to
[4009.27s -> 4016.38s]  do that's definitely an alcohol you've seen that on the counter it's called like focus ice vodka
[4016.38s -> 4025.42s]  that's what it looks like they make bottles like that that's just probably like 70 dollars too
[4026.22s -> 4037.16s]  i feel different somehow use on core try now all right let's see if this works
[4038.50s -> 4050.98s]  is it one to one because there's a lot of those things so back to the courtyard that means we
[4050.98s -> 4054.50s]  have to go just kind of down and out of here all right is there anything else that i missed
[4054.50s -> 4071.70s]  anything that's a oh camphor good thing i stopped please turn on tips trust me focus here destroy
[4071.70s -> 4088.87s]  mold cores oh i have like a mana bar does that do okay how many times can i do that
[4088.87s -> 4111.56s]  i'll take the bullets there's another one here uh-huh so that stops the flow of lava
[4114.17s -> 4123.24s]  okay well what's over here anything i can grab gunpowder good anything else
[4130.70s -> 4139.40s]  move your camera up yeah good call i don't like taking up that much screen real estate though
[4139.40s -> 4151.16s]  it's gotta be small still right back down to the courtyard am i right that hurt
[4152.76s -> 4161.32s]  fuck that hurt oh shit all right i'm okay i think i'm all right i think my knees would have gone
[4161.32s -> 4167.56s]  up through my shoulders it would have been like and my knees would be up here you know what i
[4167.56s -> 4173.08s]  mean they'd be sticking out here and i would be like oh walking around that'd be so horrible
[4173.16s -> 4185.42s]  can't get around it you need to get rid of it so where is it up here there it is
[4189.78s -> 4204.17s]  that's an interesting mechanic that's a cool mechanic where is he where all right where
[4212.06s -> 4230.73s]  shit i missed way too much i missed two shots i should make some bolts then right all right i
[4230.73s -> 4237.72s]  got eight 18 bolts back to the courtyard which is just straight through here
[4238.28s -> 4250.98s]  oh hold on i could do that better i just like fucked up my throat what did i just do
[4251.94s -> 4280.57s]  oh mrs potts that's the teapot's name right high capacity magazine nice uh what's the teapot's
[4280.57s -> 4289.42s]  name is it mrs pott no not mrs puff this is it's like miss mrs teapot right yeah i had it right
[4292.62s -> 4294.78s]  it's like none of you guys have even played among us and it shows
[4329.51s -> 4333.82s]  it's grabbing at my leg i can't why can i not do this voice today i'm just gonna run
[4334.46s -> 4360.50s]  i normally would be fine i think it's unlimited oh run i need to okay well i want to investigate
[4360.50s -> 4386.18s]  what's over there stupid motherfucker oh you know it's you know okay you wanted something funny
[4386.18s -> 4397.18s]  about streaming a video game when you stream a video game if if you if i miss one shot i sit
[4397.18s -> 4401.70s]  there and go fuck i can't miss a shot people are gonna make fun of me do you know what i mean does
[4401.70s -> 4407.37s]  that make sense like i missed a shot people are gonna omega l because i missed one bullet right
[4408.09s -> 4413.18s]  that's like always up here in the back of my head this is like oops oh you missed one shot
[4414.06s -> 4429.18s]  everyone's gonna omega l that looked like i had a hack enabled it was so good
[4429.98s -> 4448.30s]  yeah they're gonna omega l me because i missed one shot right okay i'm just trying to clear
[4448.30s -> 4453.10s]  this place out because there's definitely things here to get there has to be stuff to collect
[4453.10s -> 4471.32s]  right yeah there's something in here i cleared all this out what's here nothing no there's no
[4471.32s -> 4484.82s]  way it's a bunch of books really so i really should have just ran i just wasted like 15
[4484.82s -> 4491.53s]  bullets for no reason you can uh you can omega l now you can you can i'll bet so omega l bad
[4491.53s -> 4500.68s]  right yeah now you can do it now but one chem fluid i spent 10 bullets right all right that's
[4500.68s -> 4517.58s]  everything in here is it not one of those here whatever i feel like i could open this thing
[4517.58s -> 4524.28s]  can i open this so we're gonna go back to the courtyard and get one of the masks
[4526.39s -> 4541.82s]  but not yet what's in here you can't just all right you said so bad for like a full minute now
[4541.82s -> 4567.34s]  rendered remember what was that okay look pretty big all i have is a handgun all right i can't do
[4567.34s -> 4602.87s]  this yet what was that thing i think this is actually unlimited gunpowder very nice okay oh
[4602.87s -> 4619.91s]  there's a mask what's in the back monocular door deep in the basement it needs this mask
[4619.91s -> 4627.21s]  somebody will one of you guys remember that open this door yeah this is the dlc
[4627.21s -> 4635.38s]  okay i can't do i think i have to put the mask on and look at it right that makes sense to me
[4635.38s -> 4644.52s]  in my brain any more of those uh boo things i don't think so all right let's just do it let's
[4644.52s -> 4665.69s]  activate the first boss because that's probably what it is here we go first let me chug bronze
[4665.69s -> 4685.61s]  mask finally got it yeah okay i need three masks now let's open the door here can i open this
[4685.61s -> 4705.42s]  you can't use that here what do i have to put it on well i'm just gonna go back to the
[4706.14s -> 4715.91s]  library whatever it was go back to the dining room open the monocular door find three masks
[4715.91s -> 4733.26s]  oh equip the extended mag oops okay cool i have an extended mag now i'd rather have health thank

[4788.92s -> 4794.92s]  all over the floor go into your g mod your gary's mod tool whatever it and look down and just hit
[4794.92s -> 4803.85s]  like cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue cue make it a joke
[4803.85s -> 4813.80s]  imagine going into g mod and pressing q once to spawn one thing i don't buy it person's evil
[4813.80s -> 4822.49s]  whoever it is no i want you to spawn 20 health packs and then i want you to spawn two zombies
[4822.49s -> 4826.25s]  and put rocket ships on their backs and then activate them so they fly around the room and
[4826.25s -> 4833.13s]  their arms and legs go everywhere and they smash into the walls and shit do it now you have the
[4833.13s -> 4856.94s]  capability so do it so bronze oh it worked one of the lord's name are you talking about
[4856.94s -> 4869.06s]  one of the lord's name all right so i can get rid of this let's just do that because it's here
[4869.78s -> 4878.26s]  i should probably save it where is there a save point writer god i love resident evil games like
[4878.26s -> 4884.25s]  this the new resident evil games are so awesome do you know why because i can just press v and
[4884.33s -> 4890.92s]  know exactly where i am and exactly where i need to go i know i know exactly what i don't know i'm
[4890.92s -> 4896.36s]  not gonna get what i'm right here and the red is like bro you didn't complete this yet it's like
[4896.36s -> 4902.22s]  it's perfect like do this something in here that you can do it's red all the blue don't even look
[4902.22s -> 4907.66s]  at this don't even pay attention to see this red up here that you can go up there man oh it's i love
[4907.66s -> 4926.38s]  it they really it's such great design it's literally not okay so this opens up back where i was
[4926.86s -> 4938.98s]  is this where the duke guy is oh my god these things are everywhere i know you think it's fun
[4938.98s -> 4946.87s]  to delete my beautiful creatures but you will find out soon enough why that is stupid of you
[4947.67s -> 4961.19s]  come on i know you want to do it let's just open this minus two that was not a bad impression but
[4961.19s -> 4968.26s]  the dialogue was like an ai writing it each word was after the next one you know what i mean that
[4968.26s -> 4974.50s]  was like oh i'm like the substance is not there but the voice kind of is it was i'm just saying
[4974.50s -> 4983.64s]  words after other words and the words don't really connect at all i'm but remember i'm being speech
[4983.64s -> 4994.92s]  jammed that's very that's very stupid of you you will i always want to hear that back oh this is
[4994.92s -> 5008.07s]  where the duke sat remember he was right here there's no way the duke was sitting in that chair
[5008.07s -> 5029.94s]  oh christmas lights okay i do not recall a single thing not who i am know how i came to
[5029.94s -> 5036.22s]  be i know nothing my memories are as broken as the face i hide behind this mask all that remains
[5036.22s -> 5040.86s]  is this feeling this hunger to see others in pain the despair in their eyes the sounds of their
[5040.86s -> 5047.19s]  screams who will be my next quarry i have my minion to do my bidding he has many faces but
[5047.19s -> 5052.31s]  no brains within those skulls he is my best hound and he will chase those rabbits down
[5052.31s -> 5062.98s]  oh here's the impression okay let me hear it i know you think it's fun to delete my beautiful
[5062.98s -> 5081.64s]  creatures but you will find out soon enough why that is stupid of you that guy does not have a
[5081.64s -> 5088.46s]  plan by the way that guy's over the pa and he's just like fuck oh i don't i don't have a plan
[5088.46s -> 5094.50s]  but i gotta make something up to scare this girl because i got no plan at all it's stupid of you
[5099.77s -> 5108.49s]  one more time that was bad i know you think it's fun to delete my beautiful creatures that was
[5108.57s -> 5112.41s]  fine that first part is okay and then it was like what do i say after this i don't know what should
[5112.41s -> 5119.99s]  i say after this but you will find out soon enough why that is stupid of you but you will find out
[5119.99s -> 5124.97s]  soon enough those are all filler words because right there i was let me give some acting skills
[5124.97s -> 5133.03s]  acting class that was me saying nothing to think of what i should actually say after that and what
[5133.03s -> 5138.79s]  i said after that was not good my brain didn't come up with anything why that is so remember
[5138.79s -> 5143.19s]  these are all filler words but you will find out soon enough but you will find out soon enough
[5143.19s -> 5146.79s]  it's just i didn't even say those words they came out they just started happening like i
[5146.79s -> 5153.75s]  didn't even say those why that is and you will find out soon enough why that is you can even
[5153.75s -> 5159.59s]  hear it listen listen to this noise voice it's i break a little and you find out why that is
[5160.71s -> 5172.87s]  stupid of acting 101 do filler words until you actually come up with a thing you want to say
[5173.43s -> 5179.26s]  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah down the right hallway right like
[5179.26s -> 5188.01s]  i don't even know all right let's go oh the salon god i love this game

[6030.34s -> 6041.34s]  now this bullshit i i can't go down that hallway so let me just do this first so let me get this
[6041.34s -> 6053.83s]  these items and then get out i need to aggro them first because i'll get stuck you guys need to be
[6053.83s -> 6067.53s]  together get together i can't stop swarming around me all right that's it let's go all right so i
[6067.53s -> 6075.19s]  can't go i gotta go the other way i can't go this way right it's like this and then can i
[6075.19s -> 6087.48s]  go over here no so i can go this way right go move out of the way get out of the way please
[6088.44s -> 6120.55s]  okay what are you doing ah okay i'm gonna go right nice am i safe here all right we got animals
[6120.55s -> 6136.70s]  painting of a butterfly the picture is fixed in place and can't be removed i need a painting okay
[6136.70s -> 6148.26s]  spider painting okay so butterfly spider eats the butterfly frog eats the spider goat eats the frog
[6149.62s -> 6159.00s]  uh wolf eats the goat i think that's accurate i think that's what it wants me to do right
[6163.06s -> 6167.94s]  goat eats the frog i don't know what do goats eat no actually goats are like vegetarian
[6170.42s -> 6184.71s]  or sheep wait do sheep eat frogs i don't somebody's coming in the door okay this
[6184.71s -> 6202.94s]  can't be moved either okay so the frog does that say i fear the stealthy one it will surely bind
[6202.94s -> 6211.38s]  and suffocate me that's okay so the frog is scared of the spider okay so the butterfly is scared of
[6211.38s -> 6218.89s]  the frog because the frog will eat the butterfly the frog is scared of the spider whom is very
[6218.89s -> 6237.59s]  stealthy then the sheep is scared of the sheep likes to eat the spider the extra protein um we
[6237.59s -> 6251.34s]  fear the snarling beast they will surely terrorist his friends so right here okay frog eats the
[6251.34s -> 6260.20s]  butterfly spider eats the frog something eats the spider and then sheep is afraid of the whatever
[6260.20s -> 6271.22s]  though okay the predators stand united each staring to oh should have read the instructions
[6271.22s -> 6289.40s]  first that's it right there lion eats the sheep frog eats is eaten by that and then uh what eats
[6289.40s -> 6306.46s]  the butterfly like the wolf whatever what about the spider's description i didn't read that you're
[6306.46s -> 6317.51s]  right no notes they need to stare down their prey so this isn't this accurate
[6317.51s -> 6323.42s]  stop trying to come in here and let i think i'm missing a painting i think i have to come back in
[6323.42s -> 6336.49s]  here i'm missing a painting okay well that's fine where am i going from here i have the key

[6535.83s -> 6544.57s]  can you give a tldr of what the plot is uh yes so uh i sat down at a on a bench and there's some guy
[6545.21s -> 6549.29s]  he's like hey you know that people like apparently people don't like make fun of me because they have
[6549.29s -> 6553.21s]  like superpowers i was like hey you know there's a way to get rid of those superpowers if you'd go
[6553.21s -> 6558.17s]  and it's i have this lab and there's these notes that somebody left that like you can remove those
[6558.17s -> 6562.25s]  powers so you just are kind of a you go back to being a regular person you don't have powers
[6562.25s -> 6566.15s]  anymore uh so i touched this thing that was supposed to be this thing that gets me into the
[6566.15s -> 6589.66s]  memories of um of the mutant my seat or something and that's where we are it is easy to get your
[6589.66s -> 6608.12s]  grabby paws okay dude that resident evil 4 remake i think could be like the best game ever made
[6608.76s -> 6613.72s]  i really hope it is the resident evil 2 the resident evil 3 remake was was okay it was not
[6613.72s -> 6622.79s]  okay it was okay god the resident evil 2 remake is one of the best remakes i've ever played
[6622.79s -> 6627.43s]  what's that sound that was game of the year for me when it came out that game was so phenomenal
[6627.43s -> 6638.98s]  it was awesome i hope that it's the resident evil team team he hates elden ring no it's gonna i'm
[6638.98s -> 6646.18s]  telling you if resident evil 4 is it coming out this year resident evil 4 doesn't need a
[6646.18s -> 6652.90s]  remake resident evil 2 did need a remake um yeah it's it's interesting because when i saw the
[6652.90s -> 6657.30s]  the gameplay trailer for resident evil 4 i kind of my eyes were kind of squinting i was like
[6658.02s -> 6663.51s]  wait this is not the get i thought it was just a remaster i was like oh it's just a fresh coat of
[6663.51s -> 6667.75s]  paint but it that the whole thing is redone it's like weird to look at it's like whoa wait a minute
[6667.75s -> 6673.50s]  this is not just like a remaster it's they redid the whole entire game it's it's really weird to
[6673.50s -> 6682.33s]  look at welcome to the gallery of despair a wondrous display of those few who succeeded
[6682.33s -> 6687.80s]  in obtaining at least one mask set your sights upon those chosen few whose final moments of
[6687.80s -> 6692.79s]  despair are preserved forever in this gallery witness in this collection of the light of life
[6692.79s -> 6703.22s]  from a different perspective so these are all the roses that made it this far so i'm one of these
[6703.22s -> 6707.78s]  roses and i got to this i got to this point but they didn't make it but i did and we'll see if
[6707.78s -> 6722.71s]  i make it in quotes like i understand the story so far weird okay it's sick bastard it's locked

[6789.27s -> 6794.63s]  game that i remember loving but it's been like turned up a couple of notches i just hope they
[6794.63s -> 6800.55s]  don't change too much i hope it's just like a full-on let's like squash the bugs let's make
[6800.55s -> 6807.45s]  it cool looking let's make it really high quality looking there really weren't even any bugs that

[7702.36s -> 7708.22s]  gonna hold on to it you're gonna spend six hours on a three hour long dlc i i mean unless there's
[7708.22s -> 7715.38s]  anything really really more than the third mask and kind of the last bits i don't know we'll see
[7716.18s -> 7735.13s]  it's been fun so far rusted scrap you can now craft new items use the craft command in your tab
[7736.18s -> 7743.56s]  shotgun shells are gunpowder plus rusted scrap pipe bombs are rusted scrap gunpowder and herbs
[7743.56s -> 7768.18s]  all right we're back here this is pre-recorded it's stop talking this is back out to this
[7769.51s -> 7785.35s]  weird area all right so i have the second mask all right this is this room which i don't need
[7785.35s -> 7806.26s]  to do anymore i got the mask when we had to oh wait what down here i can't move this might as
[7806.26s -> 7819.70s]  well all right so i can't open that door so i'm gonna go back to the i gotta go downstairs snake
[7819.70s -> 7832.25s]  painting cool all right so where's that painting room can you let us bet say something what there
[7832.25s -> 7847.46s]  were a big amount of subs oh yeah i appreciate it i really do thank you so much i really do but i
[7847.46s -> 7855.35s]  don't i don't shout out subs anymore four bits uh i don't i don't do it i really appreciate it though
[7856.34s -> 7863.24s]  uh i don't shout out bits or subs anymore because i uh i don't do i have to go through this
[7863.24s -> 7871.74s]  if i go through this it was 50 subs it's a lot of subs it is i appreciate it but i don't shout out
[7871.74s -> 7878.63s]  subs or bits anymore i just don't it was a decision i made a couple years ago and i have to stick to
[7878.63s -> 7889.91s]  it i am sorry if you uh want me to address big amounts of subs and bits but if i do that
[7890.71s -> 7895.27s]  let's say i start only addressing the ones that are 50 or 100 subs or something like that right
[7895.99s -> 7901.94s]  that incentivizes people that oh well that's now he'll incentivize people to give more
[7902.50s -> 7905.72s]  because if i don't say the person that's subbed just for one month or whatever
[7906.36s -> 7911.48s]  but if you do give 100 subs i will see it and i'll talk about it so that's kind of why and i
[7911.48s -> 7917.37s]  honestly i don't want to i don't want to put pressure on the community or myself if i'm on
[7917.37s -> 7922.81s]  us too because i really don't want uh the stream like i've talked about years in the past but we'll
[7922.81s -> 7929.05s]  bring it up again i don't want you to be essentially incentivized to pay me money for me to like say
[7929.05s -> 7936.78s]  something or talk to you i don't like that i never have um i think it's it's kind of healthier if you
[7936.78s -> 7942.57s]  just if you decide that you're you like the stream and you want to sub then that's all there is to
[7942.57s -> 7948.82s]  it right or if you want to give gifted subs i really appreciate it but i i don't really want
[7948.82s -> 7955.22s]  to turn the stream into a way to incentivize oh well if i give 50 subs or 100 subs then he'll
[7955.22s -> 7961.40s]  talk he'll he'll he'll bring it up um and let me be very very clear to whoever just gave 50 subs
[7961.40s -> 7971.05s]  that's fucking amazing um that's thank you but i you know i don't want to just you know what i'm
[7971.05s -> 7978.63s]  saying you get it he doesn't want your money i would rather you buy yourself a fucking nice
[7978.63s -> 7986.78s]  new pair of shoes all right i need to i did the thing where i walked in a circle and talked for
[7986.78s -> 8003.26s]  two minutes so we gotta go this way how do i even get back there oh there we go like this right
[8004.63s -> 8014.07s]  yes no how do i get back to the stairs i have to go all the way around don't i because i can't go
[8014.07s -> 8024.81s]  oh no no it's right here because i can't go through here so how do i get i have to go this way
[8025.77s -> 8054.44s]  and then no how do i get back over here because this goes to out here oh okay i can unlock this
[8054.44s -> 8071.94s]  door cool okay oh let's go three arrow dlc uh pepe laughie the thing's back isn't it
[8089.40s -> 8108.63s]  aren't you but you cannot simply do as you please there's only one more mask oh god damn it all
[8108.63s -> 8139.18s]  right so i gotta go left and put the mask on okay and then wait can i get the shotgun no i can't
[8139.18s -> 8148.81s]  i need where's that painting room where the painting room is upstairs in the gallery okay
[8148.81s -> 8168.07s]  let's go put this here go to the painting and then something on that no mask won't fit there
[8168.07s -> 8204.01s]  this one here no not the snake painting hang the snake painting here one more it's up and into the
[8204.01s -> 8214.89s]  gallery it's probably going to be for the key right yeah what is that i thought something was
[8214.89s -> 8237.64s]  on the ceiling okay so the predator what does a snake eat snake eat the frog mouse a snake does
[8237.64s -> 8258.15s]  not eat this right i hate that okay it's probably the frog snakes don't eat butterflies so who eats
[8258.15s -> 8265.56s]  okay they have to be across from each other this one can't move and this one can't move
[8265.56s -> 8288.42s]  so that's accurate right this one's also accurate but somehow it's not because then
[8289.14s -> 8302.50s]  this would be yeah okay the spider spider doesn't eat frogs do you make these puzzles to mess with
[8302.50s -> 8306.26s]  me hey can you please make it say resident evil village every time something big happens it would
[8306.26s -> 8317.78s]  be very atmospheric you make that joke and you say that to me but back in the day the first like
[8317.78s -> 8327.54s]  five iterations of this series when you pressed start it did that resident evil three so come on
[8328.34s -> 8338.10s]  the tricolor emblem begets glory onto thee that we couldn't read that what is it onto thee the
[8338.10s -> 8350.70s]  golden mask shall be granted all right so the shotgun room was i think on the first floor right
[8352.49s -> 8357.51s]  okay so first floor in between the main hall i'm gonna save it the big guy's probably gonna
[8357.51s -> 8385.11s]  be right here and it's where is it over here right through the where is it wasn't it just
[8386.15s -> 8396.49s]  wait i'm confused what just happened do you eat spiders i don't okay so now we go to the dining
[8396.49s -> 8425.08s]  room right yeah this dude eats roaches i don't okay shotgun hell yeah nice things easier all right
[8425.08s -> 8439.69s]  let me make some bullets for it shotgun ammo all right don't use this only use this when i'm
[8439.69s -> 8451.91s]  ending in an emergency i'm gonna make uh hold on to the the fluid i don't need it that's what
[8451.91s -> 8461.13s]  two okay two is a shotgun so now that door is up there can i go in the kitchen yet let me try to
[8461.13s -> 8466.25s]  go in the kitchen it might be something there that's it i'm making it up i'm not even scared
[8467.05s -> 8489.80s]  i went the wrong way okay so can i go in this kitchen the door is locked but can i get in here
[8490.92s -> 8503.37s]  no okay just checking stop interrupting the gameplay but i all right i'll activate the
[8503.37s -> 8509.40s]  mute streamer when the gameplay is active okay i understand i get it you want to make sure that

[9466.57s -> 9471.21s]  person is is helping me and coaching me because they want my power because it's going to be taken
[9471.21s -> 9474.65s]  from me and it's going to be in this little crystal and the person that's coaching me is
[9474.65s -> 9491.14s]  the one that's going to benefit from this right that's at least i feel like it's happening um
[9491.14s -> 9495.70s]  before i placed that i do want to go straight and left i'm going to go to the salon it looks

[15646.77s -> 15654.69s]  but I have to keep going all right where's the duke all right there's got to be an explanation
[15654.69s -> 15657.97s]  as to why the duke was doing that the duke is a good guy everybody loves the duke why would you
[15657.97s -> 15665.46s]  why you're not gonna make the duke bad evil that's not cool what's all this doing out here
[15666.10s -> 15698.35s]  do I have my weapons back oh I do okay where the hell am is this place actually what the hell is
[15698.35s -> 15708.64s]  going on here isn't this the thing we we blew up in the eighth game versus here and they detonate
[15708.64s -> 15717.86s]  it right they drop the orbital strike on it what is that I can sense something from over there
[15717.86s -> 15732.62s]  I thought dad was gone I thought I didn't have dad anymore wait that's not that's me okay oops
[15733.26s -> 15757.87s]  okay that was a memory dream ghost oh he's fucked up I might as well craft some items
[15757.87s -> 15769.50s]  because I'm not gonna have a chance I think unless I could find an herb it's like in the castle I
[15769.50s -> 15811.17s]  know it's been four and a half hours but what's the heal button q okay it's not q is it t thanks
[15811.17s -> 15826.61s]  for the help oh I can guard okay it's that button right that's what I made it okay okay
[15826.61s -> 15888.02s]  is it no a listing check yep coming from that noise is so off-putting it really is
[15911.63s -> 15940.75s]  good I don't use all my handgun ammo what does that do can I open okay down I need to find that
[15941.63s -> 15991.66s]  how do I get is there a safe way to get down okay oh wait I have I'm looking wait I have
[15995.41s -> 16015.25s]  I got 1.2 billion views on tiktok is that a real number oh excuse me 1.2 billion views on
[16015.81s -> 16024.46s]  germa on tiktok huh that's more than every channel I have combined like times 10
[16025.84s -> 16030.56s]  and where I do what I don't know why am I not on that why am I not getting any of that
[16031.68s -> 16058.48s]  why am I not getting any of that what oh that's what are you kidding me it was seen at some point
[16058.48s -> 16063.92s]  during my experiments with consciousness an intruder made herself at home in my realm
[16063.92s -> 16072.93s]  this intruder was none other than the failure Evelyn who's been running about enacting her
[16072.93s -> 16078.26s]  own pitiful agenda which has led to a slight disruption in my own plans had Evelyn not
[16078.26s -> 16085.15s]  interfered Rosemary Winters would have been on the verge of despair dispossessed of her will
[16085.15s -> 16092.03s]  to live and her view to my side powers instead a new passion burns within her I shall have to
[16092.03s -> 16107.12s]  extinguish the duke talking that was a lot of bullets oh yeah it's final battle time I had
[16107.12s -> 16111.68s]  intended to duplicate Rosemary Winters with the hope that a perfect replica might serve as a
[16111.68s -> 16117.36s]  suitable vessel however the results were less than ideal it would seem that some sort of
[16117.36s -> 16122.24s]  interference is preventing me from creating a suitable replica instead I have succeeded in
[16122.24s -> 16128.00s]  making what is essentially a living doll it resembles the real thing yes but has no power
[16128.00s -> 16134.75s]  such a pathetic hus could never prove suitable as a vessel I will continue my efforts in hope of
[16134.75s -> 16140.74s]  discerning the source of this interference several hypotheses have come to mind thus far
[16140.74s -> 16148.26s]  the fact that rose herself is still alive some other actor within this realm me a flaw in my
[16148.26s -> 16153.89s]  methods of production none of these seem especially likely to be the sole reason or any of them easy
[16153.89s -> 16163.34s]  problems to solve perhaps my best hope is to somehow bring rose into this realm 225 million
[16163.34s -> 16175.52s]  views on another version of germa on tick tock do I have like two billion fucking views what
[16177.42s -> 16184.03s]  how many views do I have on twitch I don't think I have 100 million 50 million maybe
[16184.83s -> 16201.42s]  on YouTube I have like three 400 million a billion I'm shy I'm so confused right I'm shocked
[16201.42s -> 16208.38s]  flexing no guys I start these are not my accounts these are not my accounts I'm not I mean flex
[16208.38s -> 16219.18s]  this is not a flex hey two billion don't look at my fucking armpits get on tick tock I'm not
[16219.18s -> 16225.76s]  getting on tick tock I'm already there I have two billion views okay further experiments with these
[16225.76s -> 16230.08s]  rose copies as I've taken to calling these husks have you looked another interesting wrinkle to
[16230.08s -> 16242.32s]  pursue somebody uploaded all of the dollhouse across like 200 parts as like all right when
[16242.32s -> 16246.00s]  subjected to situations evoking extreme terror they actually begin to express some semblance
[16246.00s -> 16251.23s]  of roses abilities this warrants more research and I think that by first creation the masked duke
[16251.79s -> 16260.18s]  is just the one to wait hold on a minute this warrants more research and I think
[16260.18s -> 16265.86s]  that my first creation the masked duke is just the one to perform the stress test
[16265.86s -> 16271.38s]  so this is not the real duke watching me the entire time so the that's this is not duke this
[16271.38s -> 16311.70s]  is a masked duke okay we already saw that no he didn't did we okay all right I'm glad that
[16311.70s -> 16318.38s]  that's not the real duke the mega my seat absorbs the memories of all life within its reach but
[16318.38s -> 16322.70s]  there are laws which govern this world within it seems worthwhile to catalog them as they become
[16322.70s -> 16330.24s]  apparent the memories that comprise this realm do not strictly reflect reality only those who
[16330.24s -> 16335.44s]  are attuned to the meta my seat in life retain control of their faculties here in this realm
[16336.00s -> 16340.88s]  it aligns with my understanding of the mega my seat has revealed to me and its visions before
[16340.88s -> 16348.02s]  my death yes my death my physical body is gone absorbed into the mega my seat and yet I do not
[16348.02s -> 16353.54s]  despair this fate has granted me fascinating insights all those years I strived have continued
[16353.54s -> 16359.09s]  to strive they're not for nothing the memories the consciousness understanding and knowledge I
[16359.09s -> 16365.49s]  accumulated in life have transferred here to the mega my seat where it serves as a source of power
[16365.49s -> 16371.50s]  within this realm if I can harness this power I believe I can use it to affect the thoughts and
[16371.50s -> 16376.62s]  memories of others of course it's hardly a perfect arrangement with so many minds and memories
[16376.70s -> 16380.62s]  gathered here finding and retrieving a single person from amidst the rabble has proven an
[16380.62s -> 16387.42s]  immense challenge her memories are here yes but dissolute perhaps what is needed is the right
[16387.42s -> 16393.18s]  vessel into which to hold her and of course I know of the perfect vessel the only real candidate in
[16393.18s -> 16401.25s]  all my years of searching rosemary winters this is the guy we saw on the bench in the beginning
[16401.25s -> 16417.42s]  is this like this is his project or something I don't even know who that guy was okay so cool I
[16417.42s -> 16421.42s]  guess we know what we're doing now we're gonna pick up all this stuff there's a lot of ammo
[16422.22s -> 16433.31s]  let's take a quick look over here no one deeper you're losing viewers dude do a joke
[16435.09s -> 16449.50s]  oh fuck all right I'll do something wicked funny there's that feeling again it's so strong it must
[16449.50s -> 16456.75s]  be the crystal that pole I've been feeling is close but I just can't go any further I thought
[16456.75s -> 16461.79s]  I made it when I saw that blue light but no not quite only I've been braver faster stronger so
[16461.79s -> 16469.54s]  close I was so close I'm almost there it's your birthday today cake and ice cream is on its way
[16475.34s -> 16491.78s]  cool it's through here how would you even know that you you actually would not know that okay
[16491.78s -> 16500.21s]  here we go here's the here's the open book to the exact page presented on what happened in the story
[16500.21s -> 16507.71s]  here we go black god which lives in us in which we live create for us a new world as befits your
[16507.71s -> 16513.31s]  will your dark consciousness holds for us a second chance graciously offered and joyously
[16513.31s -> 16519.47s]  accepted you drink the blood of the lost lamb as it falls upon your darkened earth not to destroy
[16519.47s -> 16533.36s]  but to preserve and once again deliver it onto life what a twist what an ad what a twist I can't
[16533.36s -> 16549.39s]  believe it was Cthulhu the whole time I'm so sarcastic this one's the real deal feel it here
[16549.39s -> 16567.98s]  it is what do you think that smells like I think it smells like paint like that smells like a fresh
[16567.98s -> 16593.36s]  thing of paint it just probably smells like paint thinner or something is this what normal feels like
[16593.36s -> 16614.29s]  uh-oh here it is the person behind it all Evelyn who is this again rose Miranda I've waited so long
[16615.09s -> 16631.30s]  who are you my name is Miranda oh maybe she won't see it far too powerful for me to subdue
[16631.30s -> 16636.90s]  directly fully I knew where the crystal was I had to lure you into this realm I've been searching
[16636.90s -> 16653.47s]  you might willingly I know you know where it is no but case said did he or did I was an illusion
[16653.63s -> 16660.43s]  illusion very convincing wouldn't you say what are you hiding we're just doing references from
[16660.43s -> 16680.45s]  other movies game become the vessel for my evil shit he's not in frame no I wanted to get a picture
[16680.45s -> 16728.91s]  of him oh come on let's cut it off even more okay oh wait come on
[16742.43s -> 16749.01s]  wait what dude don't waste your bullets on a fucking shitty enemy that was a
[16749.09s -> 16751.41s]  shotgun bullet dad don't do what are you out of your mind

[16806.13s -> 16811.97s]  the game and I did it's just ahead I had to pretend to be somebody else so your expectations
[16811.97s -> 16828.59s]  could have been subverted for a minute dad help fuck I missed it it's all right
[16829.39s -> 16839.23s]  I can't wait to we're gonna see Ethan's face yeah you know we don't ever see Ethan's face

[17568.26s -> 17586.90s]  dad it's not a two I'm just frustrated at how I can't dodge this shit I hope we get to see his
[17586.90s -> 17593.20s]  face because that's the whole thing it's like oh you you don't can't see Ethan's face please come

[17609.42s -> 17621.30s]  come here so much power you truly would have been the perfect vessel for my
[17624.10s -> 17632.10s]  I'm not a goddamn vessel not some stupid copy I mean Rose and you're done
[17634.35s -> 17656.59s]  so we won all right Ethan show the face imagine if he's like oh my god that's pretty
[17660.24s -> 17671.46s]  my mouth is too slippery even though I wasn't there with you always watched over you I'm so
[17671.46s -> 17683.65s]  sorry I couldn't protect you all you've ever done is protect me not this time you lost your chance
[17684.85s -> 17691.33s]  I'm so sorry oh it was my choice and I don't regret it one bit
[17692.53s -> 17700.90s]  if I left you then we never would have had this chance he's just a guy face to face
[17705.87s -> 17730.66s]  no I don't think they're gonna do it so it's okay I'm so proud of you they want to do it so bad
[17730.74s -> 17734.26s]  I'm very proud of you you know they want to do it so bad the arm's gonna come down
[17745.41s -> 17754.54s]  the arm directly in the way oh hey they did stay true they they were like we're not showing his
[17754.54s -> 17764.38s]  face they didn't make that up they were they stayed true to their word we're not gonna show it I'm
[17764.38s -> 17779.60s]  back it's like 300 years have passed the guy that brought her here is just a skeleton in the corner

[17814.26s -> 17818.42s]  nobody can touch the moon it's too far away wait what if he has a rocket ship
[17819.87s -> 17830.66s]  okay then you can touch your butt it'd be very very cool you were being silly I don't think the
[17831.62s -> 17857.44s]  two out of ten mad mad no just that what for that one 10 second period it was a two out of ten
[17858.45s -> 17864.96s]  hey dad everything else was like a it was solid it was fun I think it was worth playing it was
[17864.96s -> 17872.34s]  okay sorry I missed I'll explain I have a lot of tests coming up you know how it is
[17876.96s -> 17880.40s]  I played some really shit DLC before this was this was pretty good
[17882.75s -> 17902.06s]  duty calls that second part with the the dolls where else today of all days wait we have a
[17902.06s -> 17911.84s]  situation you're needed Evelyn don't you ever call me that again it's just a joke this is the end of
[17911.84s -> 17920.29s]  the first end of the game I can show you things even Chris doesn't know I can do so this cut
[17920.29s -> 17943.58s]  scene takes place stand down I want you to keep it together Rose you're a lot like him you know
[17943.58s -> 17960.13s]  I know wasn't there like a weird ending here where they had there was somebody standing here
[17960.13s -> 17983.58s]  we're gonna see who it is I remember asking that same question at the end of the base game I enjoyed
[17983.58s -> 17987.82s]  that that was fun okay that one segment where I was having trouble with the understanding the
[17987.82s -> 17991.10s]  parry I didn't get it I thought it was it just suck I thought it was an absorb I didn't think
[17991.10s -> 17996.85s]  it was a parry that was two out of ten everything else was solid the horror parts were awesome
[17997.73s -> 18002.48s]  that was scary shit man I think it was a solid buy here this is a solid buy and there's still
[18002.48s -> 18007.44s]  more to see because I want to do the other stuff I want to look at the other stuff there's like a
[18007.44s -> 18014.06s]  whole other thing to do you can play as Lady Demetrius and um what's the other guy the
[18014.06s -> 18025.46s]  mechanical guy I want to try it I thought that was very I enjoyed that that whole second segment
[18025.46s -> 18044.58s]  was terrifying I actually honestly I really liked eight I did like eight I thought it was really
[18044.58s -> 18053.55s]  good as a complete picture here as the whole thing's done at this point right I actually
[18053.55s -> 18068.16s]  enjoyed eight what do you rate it I don't know I don't have it's a DLC how do you rate a DLC
[18068.16s -> 18073.84s]  it's like to me DLC is either buy it or don't I it's not an you know what I mean it's like an
[18073.84s -> 18085.98s]  edition the Resident Evil 8 is like an 8.5 8.4 for me at least what all right let's what did I rate
[18085.98s -> 18099.15s]  it like a year ago when I played it I gave it a rating I think eight's better than seven you gave
[18099.15s -> 18108.11s]  it a seven I think it was like it was a high seven I think low eight eight point two honestly it's
[18108.11s -> 18113.95s]  hard to say if I prefer seven or eight because I played eight more recently and it's been a one
[18113.95s -> 18120.51s]  guys something I think a lot of people might not know it's hard for me to give a good scoring
[18120.51s -> 18128.53s]  system here considering I played the entire game of Resident Evil 7 in VR I played that on the PS
[18128.53s -> 18134.21s]  VR at launch because it was exclusive and it was a I was like holy shit I'm gonna do that I don't
[18134.21s -> 18141.68s]  know why I did that that was so I should not have done that but I did the entire game from start to
[18141.76s -> 18149.55s]  finish in VR so I don't know maybe I'll have it I would have a different opinion if I played it
[18149.55s -> 18168.50s]  normally I don't know I'm feeling really bad after some of those streams it was funny all right we're
[18168.50s -> 18181.66s]  gonna get a post credits thing or should I just skip it just let us know now there's no after
[18181.66s -> 18192.83s]  credits thing hey wow this is great this is awesome because this is exactly what I told you was going
[18192.83s -> 18197.55s]  to happen exactly what I told you somebody said dude it's a three and a half hour experience if
[18197.55s -> 18202.75s]  you just play it three and a half hours right so 340 I've been streaming for five hours that is one
[18202.75s -> 18208.64s]  hour and 20 minutes of nonsense that's one hour and 20 minutes of me just talking and just like
[18208.64s -> 18219.14s]  pausing and talking and saying weird shit I told you this is gonna happen okay cool you've completed
[18219.14s -> 18224.18s]  the following challenge completion points can be used to purchase items in the extra content shop
[18225.07s -> 18235.65s]  oh did I just buy something I hope I just didn't buy something you mean I could have had this on
[18235.65s -> 18242.05s]  the whole did I have this the whole time or did I just unlock this what I feel like I had that
[18242.05s -> 18254.30s]  already okay so what let me see there's an extra content shop oh okay the mercenaries additional
[18254.30s -> 18268.72s]  orders this is the other thing I want to see but wait okay I got it special weapon 80,000 how many
[18268.72s -> 18282.22s]  do I only have 32,000 I thought I just had way more than that well you can play as the baby oh no
[18283.10s -> 18296.88s]  I was like how did they handle this okay um do I actually have to unlock them or are they just in
[18296.88s -> 18313.18s]  the game they're probably just in the game okay additional orders all right Ethan Chris oh there's
[18313.18s -> 18325.10s]  two other characters all right I'm gonna try it I'll go with Ethan how does this how do I play this
[18329.60s -> 18338.43s]  there he is that's the duke okay the mercenaries first purchase any equipment weapons you need
[18338.43s -> 18343.49s]  from the shop then you go out to the field you need to defeat as many enemies as possible
[18343.49s -> 18349.04s]  in the time limit get a good rhythm going and build up combos okay the goal will appear touch
[18349.04s -> 18358.32s]  the goal to finish move on to the next area okay this thing's pretty explanatory welcome
[18358.32s -> 18370.64s]  Ethan I have 20,000 this is all an investment Ethan bye um okay you're going to be so bad at
[18370.64s -> 18379.10s]  this I I just want to unlock the I don't think I can upgrade anything oh I can shit all right
[18379.10s -> 18384.38s]  well should I buy securing goods is more important than anything I buy the shotgun immediately my
[18384.38s -> 18389.26s]  friend I hope this one makes itself useful I'm gonna buy the shotgun and I'm gonna upgrade the
[18389.26s -> 18407.02s]  shotgun's capacity what an idiot okay now I'm gonna buy shotgun ammo I can't choose wisely
[18407.02s -> 18412.86s]  your luck till next we meet oh I got a lot okay all right let's I'm gonna just go make some um
[18412.86s -> 18460.66s]  let's go get an a rank in a normal stage you got it let's go what is this
[18460.82s -> 18492.59s]  I think that's pretty good whoa shotgun ammo load it load it load it load the shotgun
[18498.78s -> 18531.10s]  the goal has spawned wait what's this oh where's the goal where's it cool get an a rank or above in
[18531.10s -> 18537.02s]  all normal stages you need to get an s rank or above oh my god am I gonna be able to even do that
[18537.98s -> 18550.30s]  if it's just looking window shop away this simple modification can be done in just a moment
[18558.02s -> 18567.87s]  this is all an investment even till next we meet more kills and more points all right
[18569.46s -> 18577.15s]  okay let's just round everybody up then oh my god why is it so fucking loud it's
[18577.23s -> 18579.07s]  louder 10 times louder than the base game
[18581.31s -> 18657.92s]  where are they stop it stop it whatever use yep all right where are they where's where's the
[18657.92s -> 18737.74s]  enemies can an enemy spawn where where is an enemy where the fuck are the enemies this guy sucks
[18804.61s -> 18810.18s]  pick the gun gun gun man I pressed it like three times
[18810.18s -> 18837.54s]  easy this stage sucks ass fuck this stage worse stage in the game that stage was awful
[18838.26s -> 18840.80s]  like they're up here they're down here they're down here they're up there they're up there
[18840.80s -> 18858.16s]  they're up there oh fuck this area okay I was just thinking of ways to pass the time
[18862.88s -> 18869.66s]  choose wisely your life may depend on it okay more shotgun I'm doing rate of fire
[18870.62s -> 18878.64s]  and reload it's fine all finished and then rate of fire this thing is so slow
[18881.54s -> 18899.52s]  all right now that's better let's go thank you for your speed increased speed increase
[18918.11s -> 18943.78s]  why was this gun where did you whoa open it open it open it open it open it open it
[18944.58s -> 18947.46s]  where's bad guy where's bad guy bad guy

[19115.39s -> 19145.95s]  how do I know what I got for scores on them A I need to get an A in every single one of these
[19145.95s -> 19163.79s]  no in the normal stages oh okay so wait wait wait wait go back so I'm imagining that these are
[19163.79s -> 19172.70s]  probably only a few of these are normal stages you need A in all and S on the last one okay
[19172.70s -> 19187.15s]  let's see what I can do here I think I'm gonna go with um hmm all right this is I'm going for
[19187.15s -> 19190.75s]  a weird play here I'm gonna try to I'm not gonna spend any money I'm gonna buy the SMG
[19190.75s -> 19210.69s]  I'm skilled at all sorts maybe let's just do this for now this might be dumb but I'm gonna do it
[19210.69s -> 19245.42s]  thank you for your patronage oh oh my god I don't remember these guys how do I fight these guys
[19245.42s -> 19250.42s]  I don't remember how to fight these guys I think they're thinking they're back right
[19250.98s -> 19281.49s]  I don't remember I think it's on their back um what do you get stuck in the wall or
[19282.21s -> 19294.34s]  I don't know how do you kill these guys I need explosives
[19315.36s -> 19334.42s]  hey oh my god I just walked right into his drill I'm stuck against the wall

[19443.90s -> 19456.93s]  where's the last one ah fuck it I don't know where's the last one whatever I don't think I'm
[19456.93s -> 19465.52s]  gonna get A if I don't get at least an A on this then I quit I didn't really put time into this
[19465.52s -> 19542.67s]  mode but it's fun this is all an investment this is just a moment all right let's go oh it's so loud
[19647.17s -> 19676.40s]  fucking clean if I say where you at where are they oh my god they're right there
[19680.59s -> 19695.94s]  oh my ears that's a 40 hit combo dude I didn't stop once that was the cleanest gameplay version
[19695.94s -> 19719.50s]  that was clean that's gonna carry this whole playthrough I like this this one I think was
[19719.50s -> 19759.58s]  going one gun Andy I think right why was that that was so fast I'll do one gun Andy okay here we go
[19759.58s -> 19813.92s]  get that I don't even know I couldn't even read it dude I cracked out on that one I really did

[20721.78s -> 20736.80s]  so now you're saying if I get an A here then I can play as the factory guy see rewards it's
[20736.80s -> 20757.42s]  probably down here right okay unlock get an A rank or above in all normal stages what classifies
[20757.42s -> 20773.49s]  a normal stage this is not pre-recorded stream I'm just gonna stay with Ethan what I know this
[20773.49s -> 20788.19s]  time I think I'm going shotgun Andy yeah I'm going shotgun Andy here this one I'm going for

[20829.30s -> 20894.50s]  shotgun time see if I can do this you bought sniper rifle ammo I should have saved that that
[20894.50s -> 20951.65s]  was dumb are they standing up or what I don't know okay cool there we're gaming right now
[20951.65s -> 21001.06s]  hurry up running out of time here shotgun yep I lost the combo fuck oh what happens

[21046.03s -> 21068.27s]  get out of here I don't know I don't think so man no no I gotta leave it sucks but I have to leave
[21068.27s -> 21087.54s]  oh that's not cool maybe I probably won't get an A then that's bad oh well worth a try how do I
[21087.54s -> 21122.59s]  I can't get in here um why can I not open this little pipe bomb no it won't work is the subscriber
[21122.59s -> 21138.80s]  banner in your about section supposed to lead to a Gotham Knights page no it's not it's not actually
[21140.26s -> 21145.33s]  thank you for bringing that to my attention all right I'm kind of sweaty and I think that's
[21145.33s -> 21160.70s]  probably it for tonight this was fun plus I'm lost in the concrete level I'm lost in the concrete
[21160.70s -> 21174.45s]  level I give up I give up yeah I'll see you tomorrow thanks for joining me uh I thought I
[21174.45s -> 21177.57s]  kind of really got into this I didn't think I was gonna flame this for six hours but tomorrow
[21178.88s -> 21186.67s]  we're gonna be doing Phasmophobia with Vinnie and friends and then after that
[21187.31s -> 21192.74s]  I'm gonna play at dead of night and if I beat that then we'll do another scary game
[21192.74s -> 21203.41s]  should be fun I'm gonna quit that was cool though I like that maybe I'll play that on my own just
[21203.41s -> 21220.16s]  mess around is there anything else to see is that the FMV game I don't know it's like you're running
[21220.16s -> 21227.92s]  around a hotel or something third person for the main campaign yeah that's cool I feel like you
[21227.92s -> 21233.87s]  can play through the entire game in third person to be a different game and then on Halloween yeah
[21233.87s -> 21245.12s]  Halloween I'm doing uh the cooking show with critical with Charlie that should be fun should
[21245.12s -> 21252.42s]  be fun the internet held up today which is kind of strange we're usually pretty used to it somewhere
[21252.42s -> 21259.97s]  around like an hour ago dying so I'm just gonna pull my streams back an hour or two to try to
[21259.97s -> 21274.86s]  avoid it I am so sweaty Jesus the idea is I'm trying to avoid being live between eight and ten
[21274.86s -> 21280.62s]  so until I can get it fixed so I reliably know it's not gonna happen because it's just so weird
[21280.62s -> 21298.18s]  very strange but yeah I will see you guys tomorrow I'll see you guys very soon a couple more scary
[21298.18s -> 21306.26s]  games tomorrow what time tomorrow 2 p.m pacific tomorrow and then what time on Halloween that's
[21306.26s -> 21312.46s]  a good question I think they usually I think Charlie usually is around noon right I'm pretty
[21312.46s -> 21322.24s]  sure it's probably gonna be around noon on Halloween that will be live 2 p.m tomorrow what about stay
[21322.24s -> 21337.73s]  out of the house I'll play that tomorrow we'll do a bunch of we'll do at least two or three horror
[21337.73s -> 21343.31s]  games tomorrow because phasmophobia with Vinnie is not I don't think it's gonna be very long
[21343.31s -> 21347.81s]  I think we're only gonna do it for an hour or so we're just gonna get it and mess around for
[21347.81s -> 21355.84s]  like an hour maybe two so there'll be plenty of time to do other stuff you have you've had an
[21355.84s -> 21363.09s]  MRI before what was it like I've got one on Monday um it's it's really not a big deal it's you it's
[21363.09s -> 21368.51s]  all good it just makes a lot of noise they give you usually give you protection for your ears
[21369.70s -> 21375.25s]  and as long as you just it's kind of just while you're there while you're in there the way that I
[21375.25s -> 21384.13s]  have done MRIs before is I just kind of let the machine make a beat and then it's not like scary
[21384.13s -> 21389.25s]  anymore it's not weird anymore um because it goes like this it goes like
[21393.57s -> 21396.06s]  so while it's doing that it's just like
[21397.20s -> 21399.70s]  like
[21401.68s -> 21409.66s]  I just make it a music I make it a song and depending if you're doing it with or without
[21409.66s -> 21417.60s]  contrast um they give you a depends what it is but sometimes they give you an IV
[21418.32s -> 21424.54s]  but IVs are easy that's the honestly if you're doing it with contrast the IV is the only part
[21424.54s -> 21431.55s]  that's like oh wow they like you're doing an IV if you're not doing contrast then it's not a big
