[0.31s -> 13.36s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Battlefield 3 gameplay commentary.
[13.36s -> 18.06s]  Only the second Battlefield 3 video on this channel, and I'm gonna try and change that.
[18.06s -> 24.56s]  I'm trying to get better at this game, trying to find my groove playing with Shibby2142 and a couple other guys.
[24.56s -> 28.06s]  They helped me out. They were pretty good seasoned veterans at this game.
[28.06s -> 36.05s]  So, enjoy the live commentary guys starting right now.
[36.15s -> 38.45s]  Oh, no. Oh, it's a bad idea.
[38.45s -> 44.11s]  Whoa. Hey, he just went right by me. I'm cool with that.
[44.11s -> 48.46s]  Oh, where's this guy?
[48.46s -> 51.46s]  Alright, everyone join Charlie.
[51.46s -> 54.46s]  Wait, can't, can't just like kick this person?
[54.46s -> 56.46s]  Yeah, I can just kick. Oh, okay.
[56.46s -> 58.46s]  Cause I don't like him anyways. How did I not get that guy?
[58.46s -> 60.46s]  One second. Oh, he just died.
[60.46s -> 65.31s]  Jerma, watch it around the corner. Nice. Yeah, I got him.
[65.31s -> 70.43s]  One more. Oh, Jesus.
[70.43s -> 72.43s]  Alright, join up Shibs. Oh my God, he's trying to knife me.
[72.43s -> 74.43s]  Nice dude, that was nice.
[75.33s -> 77.33s]  Thank you for just saving my life.
[77.33s -> 80.40s]  Anybody else?
[80.40s -> 83.33s]  No, I think that's it.
[83.33s -> 86.33s]  Oh, no, there's somebody. Oh, no, there's an AA.
[86.33s -> 88.33s]  He's like on the opposite side of two walls.
[88.33s -> 90.33s]  Oh, God. No, he got me.
[90.33s -> 93.96s]  So far away. He got me.
[93.96s -> 95.96s]  I don't know. Sniper, two guys.
[95.96s -> 98.40s]  Nice, good job.
[98.40s -> 100.40s]  There's another guy though, his buddy.
[100.40s -> 102.40s]  Got health back, Shibya, get some health on him.
[102.40s -> 104.40s]  I'm down, down.
[104.40s -> 107.40s]  Can I revive him? Yeah, we traded so he's dead.
[108.30s -> 110.47s]  Oh, I'm dead, dead? Yeah.
[110.47s -> 113.22s]  The green meaning.
[113.22s -> 115.22s]  Like the green monster.
[115.22s -> 117.22s]  Jerma knows all about that.
[117.22s -> 119.22s]  Oh, come on.
[119.22s -> 121.22s]  What do you know about suppressing fire right there?
[121.22s -> 126.22s]  Oh my God. Oh, God, no.
[126.22s -> 128.22s]  Is that you in the helicopter right there?
[128.22s -> 131.80s]  Dude, the helicopter.
[131.80s -> 133.80s]  Nice.
[133.80s -> 135.80s]  I tried to come in and just flank him with a helicopter.
[135.80s -> 137.80s]  Oh, come on.
[137.80s -> 139.80s]  No, I have no ammo left.
[139.80s -> 142.10s]  I have absolutely no ammo left.
[143.00s -> 146.19s]  Done?
[146.19s -> 148.19s]  Oh my God, it's a helicopter.
[148.19s -> 150.19s]  The sun is so bright.
[150.19s -> 152.19s]  Too bright.
[153.19s -> 155.49s]  Like notify that the building's falling.
[155.49s -> 161.49s]  Yeah, that's probably the rarest way to die in this game is by destruction because, you know, Frostbite 2.
[161.49s -> 163.49s]  So much destruction, guys.
[163.49s -> 165.49s]  Less destruction than Bad Company 2.
[165.49s -> 167.49s]  Makes sense, right?
[167.49s -> 169.49s]  Destruction.
[169.49s -> 171.49s]  Yeah, so getting killed by destruction, that's like an honor.
[171.49s -> 173.49s]  Oh, boy.
[173.49s -> 175.49s]  Oh, God, that's a helicopter.
[175.49s -> 177.49s]  Hit the helicopter face on with a rocket.
[177.49s -> 179.49s]  What do I get?
[179.49s -> 181.49s]  Nothing. Nothing from it.
[181.49s -> 183.49s]  Nope. Nope.
[183.49s -> 185.49s]  Alright, let's take BA's also getting capped.
[185.49s -> 187.49s]  Coming right behind you, Shibby.
[187.49s -> 189.49s]  Alright.
[189.49s -> 191.49s]  Because I'm trying to take out element choppers with rockets and it doesn't work.
[191.49s -> 193.49s]  Minus the left. Minus Shibby.
[193.49s -> 195.73s]  Yep, two of them.
[195.73s -> 197.73s]  I got killed.
[197.73s -> 199.73s]  I don't even know where he was.
[199.73s -> 202.29s]  Working on him. Got one.
[202.29s -> 206.32s]  I saw that.
[206.32s -> 208.32s]  Ooh, with the revive clutch.
[208.32s -> 211.33s]  Not a lot of people do that.
[211.33s -> 214.53s]  Can't switch revive.
[214.53s -> 216.53s]  It's a roll.
[216.53s -> 218.53s]  Okay, A's clean, B's clean, C's clean.
[218.53s -> 220.53s]  Wait, C's flashing. Let's go.
[220.53s -> 222.53s]  Why did I do that?
[222.53s -> 224.53s]  Hold on to my chopper.
[224.53s -> 226.53s]  He's on the roof.
[226.53s -> 228.53s]  Oh, eat this.
[228.53s -> 231.03s]  Eat this, baby.
[231.03s -> 233.03s]  Alright, let's go.
[233.03s -> 235.03s]  Vote next map.
[235.03s -> 237.03s]  Oh, I got your RPG.
[237.03s -> 244.26s]  Got him.
[244.26s -> 247.89s]  Got this.
[247.89s -> 249.89s]  We got this.
[249.89s -> 251.89s]  Where are we going?
[251.89s -> 253.89s]  I don't know. I accidentally pushed E out of the helicopter.
[253.89s -> 255.89s]  Shibby, I like this...
[255.89s -> 257.89s]  I like this scope you got.
[257.89s -> 260.32s]  This thing's good.
[260.32s -> 262.32s]  I like this little...
[262.32s -> 265.08s]  The Cobra.
[265.08s -> 267.08s]  So that's considered one of the red dots.
[267.08s -> 269.08s]  And then there's the red dot, red dot, which is the American version.
[269.08s -> 271.08s]  Why are we going to E?
[271.08s -> 273.08s]  Oh, in front of us, in front of us.
[273.08s -> 276.32s]  Got him.
[276.32s -> 278.32s]  Where did he spawn from?
[278.32s -> 280.32s]  Let's just go take A, if you want to go on foot.
[280.32s -> 282.32s]  Yeah, I'm coming with you.
[282.32s -> 286.48s]  Alright, I'm going to take this corner right here.
[286.48s -> 289.24s]  Oh, we're going to shot from behind.
[289.24s -> 291.24s]  Oh my stupid little bird.
[291.24s -> 293.24s]  I hate that.
[293.24s -> 295.60s]  He came out of nowhere.
[295.60s -> 297.60s]  Anybody in the building?
[297.60s -> 299.60s]  That thing's so overpowered.
[299.60s -> 301.60s]  Alright.
[301.60s -> 303.60s]  Hopefully our car is still there.
[303.60s -> 305.60s]  I kind of paid her a lot for that one.
[305.60s -> 307.97s]  Yeah, we had valet pocket.
[307.97s -> 310.21s]  Uh oh.
[310.21s -> 312.21s]  Don't push E.
[312.21s -> 314.21s]  Woohoo!
[314.21s -> 316.21s]  No, it disappeared.
[316.21s -> 318.21s]  Guy on the road.
[318.21s -> 320.21s]  You guys are going B?
[320.21s -> 323.09s]  We're going B, B, E, E.
[323.09s -> 325.09s]  There's a car at B, so watch it.
[325.09s -> 327.09s]  We're in a ram it.
[327.09s -> 329.09s]  Germa, it's all you.
[329.09s -> 332.29s]  This guy's down.
[332.29s -> 334.29s]  Oh, where was he?
[334.29s -> 336.60s]  I'm dead.
[336.60s -> 338.60s]  That was a poor decision.
[338.60s -> 342.60s]  Because we were bumping the Jurassic Park tune and I just got all jacked up.
[342.60s -> 345.27s]  T?
[345.27s -> 347.27s]  I did it!
[347.27s -> 349.27s]  Am I even capping this damn thing?
[349.27s -> 354.37s]  Protecting it.
[354.37s -> 356.37s]  Spawning on the T of space.
[356.37s -> 358.80s]  Oh no, little bird.
[358.80s -> 361.11s]  Aw yeah.
[361.11s -> 363.11s]  We're about to win.
[363.11s -> 365.11s]  These guys got crushed.
[365.11s -> 368.69s]  Secured, flag cap.
[368.69s -> 370.69s]  Oh, you need some heals, you need some heals.
[370.69s -> 372.69s]  Who's that guy?
[372.69s -> 374.69s]  Give me a sec.
[374.69s -> 376.69s]  Shoot him, just shoot him, just shoot him all, no!
[376.69s -> 381.60s]  Your team has won.
[381.60s -> 383.60s]  So that is going to wrap up the video guys.
[383.60s -> 385.60s]  Thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.
[385.60s -> 389.60s]  And I will see you guys all next time, trying to get better at Battlefield.
[389.60s -> 391.60s]  I promise you.
[391.60s -> 393.60s]  See you guys all next time.
[393.60s -> 395.60s]  Take care, everybody.
