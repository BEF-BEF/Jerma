[3.70s -> 8.18s]  All right, I'm back. Well, not quite. I'm gonna get a drink. I gotta make sure I got my tweet ready.
[8.50s -> 17.69s]  I've never done this before. Gotta make sure I do it right. I gotta make sure my tweet's ready. Did he shit himself? All right.
[18.33s -> 25.10s]  Okay, fuck. Wait, I haven't started the sponsor stream yet. I haven't started the sponsor stream, but it hasn't started yet.
[25.18s -> 35.64s]  We're still on IRL. Don't, um, all right, enough. All right, enough. I have not started yet. So
[36.60s -> 101.72s]  relax, quiet. Give me one, give me one more second. Hold on. All right, I'm almost ready. I'm almost ready.
[102.04s -> 109.05s]  I just have to change the, um, I just gotta change my game and the title.
[109.94s -> 112.74s]  He's acting like he's going to prom. This is, I've never done this before. This is a big deal.
[114.65s -> 122.34s]  This is a big deal. Let me refill my drink and I'm ready to go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[122.34s -> 127.46s]  Let's go. Let's go. All right, one more sec. He's going to prom.
[128.42s -> 166.54s]  I don't, I don't know why that was there. I don't know why that was there. Yeah, no, just take that out of here.
[166.78s -> 172.49s]  I don't know why. There's a pair, there was a pair of underwear just on my desk. What the fuck? Why?
[173.37s -> 223.00s]  I don't know why it was there. Okay. I want to give one sec. All right. I think I'm ready. Hold on.
[223.32s -> 233.99s]  I gotta make sure my tweet's ready. Gotta make sure my title's ready. I'm, I'm honestly, I'm actually
[234.55s -> 240.46s]  happy to play this. I'm excited to play this. I played the demo of this game and I was like, that was actually fun.
[240.94s -> 249.08s]  I like to play more of that. So here we are. What happened? I just got back. We, uh, moved on to a sponsor segment.
[249.56s -> 263.67s]  First time ever. I am pogging right now in real life and you'll see real quickly. Double checking the tweet.
[263.91s -> 283.77s]  I think that's fine. I think that it works. Okay. Okay. I'm not doing a YouTuber voice. Uh, no, I'm not doing that.
[284.01s -> 305.96s]  All right. I'm ready. Tweet is going out. There it is. That's a legit, that's a legit sponsored tweet here. First ever.
[305.96s -> 323.85s]  I've never done that before. I don't have Twitter. Dude, get out, you gotta, what? Yeah, we got a hashtag ad.
[324.34s -> 338.63s]  Are you nervous? No, no, I'm not at all. It's team 17. Yep. He's corporate Andy. That's, hey, that's me.
[339.03s -> 344.33s]  All right, you guys ready? I'm at this, I'm actually very excited. This game is gonna be good.
[345.14s -> 361.82s]  I played the demo. Please help with this. Can you see? This is a man size sponsor.
[363.34s -> 376.63s]  You should be able to see it now. Hey, you can see me at least. All right.
[378.22s -> 388.82s]  You ready? No, I'm not supposed to disappear. All right. So, well, what is this game? What is this?
[388.90s -> 394.46s]  Well, hold on a second. Let me tell you. This game is a game where you, uh, it's an action adventure game.
[394.86s -> 400.74s]  It seems pretty interesting. It's a game where you craft potions. The game where you, it's an action adventure
[401.56s -> 406.78s]  experience and it looks really fun. I did my research.
[407.74s -> 415.64s]  I played the demo. Might be too loud. It runs in 1,440 p.
[419.51s -> 444.36s]  Soundtrack is good. Don't swear. Stop swearing. Damn. All right, new game. Let's go. Uh,
[444.92s -> 455.10s]  I'm gonna play this person. Epic music. Oh, I gotta get, I gotta get the face cam off. At the crossroads of existence
[455.10s -> 457.10s]  there is a serpent that bites her own tail.
[458.22s -> 464.70s]  Stop swearing. You're making me look bad. And on, and on and on she gnaws without ending or beginning, only harmony.
[469.77s -> 473.29s]  And yet there are those who would be, who would sicken her and force her jaw open.
[473.85s -> 477.64s]  I'm waiting for the pogs because this is, I'm telling you, you're gonna like this.
[481.54s -> 483.54s]  Cycle broken, balance undone.
[483.86s -> 496.23s]  Until all that is left is the poison of the serpent rogue.
[505.26s -> 508.62s]  Yeah, you make potions. Actually, my cam might be in a good, I gotta move the cam.
[509.56s -> 511.80s]  You make potions and you go out and fight stuff.
[512.60s -> 515.72s]  Any NPC I believe can be killed, which is kind of scary.
[517.86s -> 521.14s]  I have played it a little bit to decide if I was like, yeah, that sounds like something I could do.
[522.62s -> 525.98s]  Let's go. We're going to two headphones and it's fucking scary. I hope you're ready.
[528.94s -> 531.42s]  Now you got a health bar up there. You got a stamina bar up there.
[537.99s -> 540.23s]  Solomon, the first steps are always the hardest.
[540.87s -> 542.87s]  Don't worry. You'll soon grow accustomed to your body.
[544.39s -> 547.91s]  You've quite a task ahead. It won't be easy, but I'll make sure to teach you all the right lessons.
[549.00s -> 550.20s]  For instance,
[550.20s -> 554.60s]  that'll be your transport out of this in-between. We'll meet again warden in a more stable place.
[555.16s -> 560.52s]  It's pretty. Lights off. Lights off. You got it.
[562.07s -> 578.01s]  You got it. Lights going off. Let me fix the cam.
[582.98s -> 594.14s]  Oh, that's better. All right, let's go. And by the way,
[594.86s -> 597.26s]  I'd run if I were you. The corruption is coming.
[604.78s -> 615.59s]  Actually, probably should run. Running takes stamina. Can you hear it? All right. Sounds good to me.
[623.43s -> 628.38s]  Is this Elden Ring? No, this is okay. Hold on. Can you die in the tutorial?
[635.72s -> 640.95s]  Go, go, go, go. All right. I'm good. No, this is not it. This is
[641.59s -> 648.70s]  there's no like dodge roll. I don't think I'm pogging so hard already.
[650.09s -> 652.09s]  You should. You actually should be.
[653.86s -> 656.02s]  I believe this is on everything by the way.
[656.74s -> 659.54s]  This is not just on steam. It's on. I think it's on everything. It's on like switch.
[660.42s -> 667.06s]  Wherever you want to get it. It's such a long journey. There it is. Source of corruption.
[668.39s -> 676.15s]  It's blight spreads like wildfire. Given time, it'll consume everything. This cannot stand. There is much to be done.
[680.47s -> 683.03s]  New quest. The corrupted land. Investigate locations.
[688.76s -> 693.40s]  Okay, I was trying to fuck around and just walk off the edge, but I just found a secret.
[694.60s -> 695.64s]  Okay.
[695.64s -> 696.76s]  Sure.
[696.76s -> 698.36s]  What the hell is in here?
[698.36s -> 702.22s]  All right, we got apples, raw meat, tea leaves.
[703.69s -> 708.17s]  Ingredients can be used to craft powerful potions with unique effects. From raising the hollow
[708.65s -> 710.81s]  to transforming yourself into another species.
[711.61s -> 718.68s]  But before you can use such ingredients, first you need to study their structure in a research laboratory. Got it. Anything else in here?
[719.32s -> 724.20s]  You can pick up stuff, right?
[724.20s -> 727.02s]  There's aloe. Check your inventory. Press Y.
[727.74s -> 736.78s]  Everything has weight too.
[736.78s -> 738.86s]  Yeah, you have to like, okay, you have to research shit
[742.62s -> 747.78s]  before you can make potions.
[747.78s -> 752.26s]  There is fighting and yeah, it is like dangerous. You can die and there's consequences for dying.
[752.74s -> 754.60s]  What is this? Discover.
[754.60s -> 759.96s]  Poor creature. The corruption truly spares no one. Corrupted dog.
[766.02s -> 771.78s]  Go through the fog. Fog dork. This is pretty, this is not, why would this be pre-recorded? What are you talking about?
[773.22s -> 775.22s]  When did we get to get to the swearing segment?
[775.38s -> 789.98s]  All right, so this is like the town. All right, so here's the brewing table.
[790.62s -> 796.09s]  Care to brew that special potion before you can use an ingredient? You must research it in the research laboratory first.
[796.73s -> 799.86s]  You should research it. Jim, is this a scary game?
[801.05s -> 808.12s]  No, I don't think so. I collect knowledge about brewing and experiment with bases of ingredients to discover the true power of alchemy.
[808.68s -> 813.64s]  Be aware that crafting potions without knowing the recipe can result in the ingredients being wasted. Don't fuck around here.
[815.88s -> 818.52s]  I don't know anything about these, so it would probably be stupid if I did it.
[821.43s -> 828.78s]  All right, you you got to research it before you can use it. I'm, I can swear that's fine, right? Can I?
[834.38s -> 840.81s]  Should I not be?
[840.81s -> 846.02s]  Okay, so research. You have to research ingredients before you can use them.
[846.82s -> 855.38s]  Repeat after me, please. You got to study a few samples first. You can track the progress in your journal. Very cool.
[855.46s -> 857.46s]  All right, so I need, I got tea leaves.
[858.06s -> 860.81s]  I need, okay, I need more.
[861.13s -> 865.00s]  All right, so that is vitality.
[865.00s -> 867.24s]  There's like little hidden chests and shit around the world. It's pretty cool.
[867.88s -> 871.54s]  This looks like a warden's chest special container built specifically for your kind.
[872.26s -> 878.18s]  Warden chests are connected in such a way that items stored in one location can be taken from another. Like a, like a diablo 2 chest, right?
[879.43s -> 882.20s]  Anybody can use it?
[882.20s -> 886.18s]  I'm not swearing.
[886.18s -> 888.58s]  All right, there's already stuff in here.
[888.58s -> 890.34s]  Healing potion.
[890.34s -> 892.79s]  Yeah, take it.
[892.79s -> 899.86s]  Damage, I think you can use potions on anybody, I think. Maybe I shouldn't take all this.
[900.58s -> 902.76s]  That was a portable lab recipe.
[902.84s -> 904.68s]  Chicken form?
[904.68s -> 907.64s]  Transforms the user into another creature with all their strengths and weaknesses.
[908.36s -> 909.72s]  Yeah, whatever, I'll take it.
[909.72s -> 913.06s]  Let's take a few of these too. All right.
[913.06s -> 915.22s]  Oh, yeah, you can cook. I forgot you can cook.
[916.82s -> 920.42s]  Yeah, you can use a cooking plate such as this to enhance the properties of your dishes.
[920.98s -> 924.66s]  Each cooking attempt requires one piece of log, which would be converted into charcoal.
[925.22s -> 926.92s]  Jesse.
[926.92s -> 930.12s]  Be aware that cooking without knowing the right recipe can result in ingredients being wasted.
[930.12s -> 934.92s]  So if you don't know anything, then there's no point. So I'm gonna hold, do I know any recipes?
[939.61s -> 940.65s]  That worked.
[940.65s -> 942.41s]  I have a choice steak.
[942.41s -> 944.84s]  All right. Well, I don't want to fuck around.
[944.84s -> 952.14s]  Do I know how to make any potions? Vitality and unexplored. Wait.
[952.70s -> 954.22s]  Do I have to research that?
[954.22s -> 958.15s]  Okay, I have to research that 20 times. Charcoal.
[964.02s -> 965.62s]  Okay. Yeah, there's a punch.
[965.62s -> 971.64s]  Two damage, that's not a dummy. Okay, cool.
[972.28s -> 975.53s]  There's a punch. This game is very pretty. It is very pretty.
[976.17s -> 980.46s]  It actually looks very nice. All right, here we go.
[980.46s -> 981.66s]  And the wardens meet.
[982.30s -> 984.46s]  Away from the darkness but under his shadow.
[984.46s -> 987.72s]  The wardens are sworn to serve the cycle and protect balance.
[987.72s -> 990.68s]  And yet, this is a dangerous place even for our kind.
[991.48s -> 994.92s]  Anyways, why don't you try and explore this area for materials and equipment?
[995.48s -> 997.80s]  It's worth training your offensive skills with the dummy as well.
[997.80s -> 1003.19s]  This is no peaceful realm, not anymore.
[1003.19s -> 1004.23s]  Stop reading my messages.
[1006.38s -> 1009.18s]  Yeah, I mean, it gives you a little bit of like what to do.
[1010.14s -> 1012.04s]  But you kind of just do whatever you want, I guess.
[1012.76s -> 1015.32s]  This seems pretty open. Wait, what is this?
[1016.94s -> 1023.16s]  Chop. I can't chop that. What about this?
[1023.80s -> 1027.03s]  This is like a big map.
[1027.03s -> 1031.75s]  So I eventually have to go here. We'll get it.
[1031.75s -> 1034.30s]  Plague doctor? Yeah, there's a plague doctor.
[1034.30s -> 1038.14s]  The kiosk lost souls are drawn to it like moths to a flame.
[1038.78s -> 1041.02s]  So much left undone, it's hard coming to terms with it.
[1041.02s -> 1044.12s]  They don't know what to do so they leave requests.
[1044.12s -> 1047.32s]  You wouldn't understand wanting is unique to those who lived.
[1047.32s -> 1049.46s]  That's why we can help and that's why we can earn rewards.
[1049.46s -> 1051.99s]  Their dear gold, their precious hope.
[1051.99s -> 1054.15s]  How much is the game?
[1054.15s -> 1057.66s]  Well, it's available right now and it is currently.
[1060.10s -> 1062.10s]  It is available on Steam right now.
[1062.10s -> 1065.51s]  I think it has a 10% off sale at the moment.
[1065.51s -> 1069.91s]  Let's take a look.
[1069.91s -> 1076.47s]  The game is currently $17.99. It's part of a bundle too.
[1076.47s -> 1081.77s]  $17 bucks? $17.99? Not 19, no. $17.99.
[1081.77s -> 1088.57s]  Let's go. That's less than a Hulk Hogan grill.
[1090.20s -> 1093.24s]  That's way less than a Hulk Hogan grill.
[1096.22s -> 1099.32s]  All right, so what is this?
[1099.32s -> 1103.50s]  This order is stained with blood so I must be in dire need of a healing potion.
[1103.50s -> 1106.70s]  So I need healing potion.
[1106.70s -> 1111.27s]  Don't have those on my chest? Oh, shit.
[1111.27s -> 1114.42s]  Okay. I didn't even make that though.
[1116.06s -> 1117.82s]  Five gold. That easy.
[1117.82s -> 1119.40s]  That's easy. Simple.
[1119.96s -> 1125.16s]  Now what? Corruption is a way of changing things.
[1125.16s -> 1128.38s]  Often for worse, but sometimes for the better.
[1128.38s -> 1132.26s]  All right. I need to collect fucking berries and stuff.
[1132.26s -> 1135.02s]  Come on. I got berries, berries, berries, berries.
[1135.02s -> 1137.59s]  Anything else on here? Was that a pumpkin?
[1137.59s -> 1142.01s]  Just take everything. Fascinating little box, isn't it?
[1142.01s -> 1143.90s]  They used to not only research new ingredients,
[1143.90s -> 1146.14s]  but also to create powerful potions on the go.
[1146.14s -> 1148.10s]  This one's mine, but you can take it.
[1149.24s -> 1155.18s]  No worries, warden. I'll make another one for myself later on.
[1155.18s -> 1160.02s]  Fresh berries. Give it a try to use it to research a new few ingredients.
[1161.74s -> 1164.46s]  Okay. So you can, if you're out and about,
[1164.46s -> 1165.66s]  you don't have to come all the way back here.
[1168.78s -> 1171.02s]  Research, pick up, or craft. All right. Research.
[1172.57s -> 1174.33s]  I got three berries, so now I know what this does.
[1174.97s -> 1182.65s]  This is add. Add. Should I pick it up?
[1182.65s -> 1188.70s]  What about this other stuff here? Tea leaves?
[1189.26s -> 1192.98s]  Yeah. This game's all about, you got to make potions.
[1192.98s -> 1198.47s]  They're like the most important thing in the entire game.
[1198.47s -> 1202.22s]  I think if you die, you need to go get your stuff too.
[1202.22s -> 1206.46s]  The game does not, it's not like, oh, I died. I'm fine.
[1206.46s -> 1208.70s]  No, you got to go pick up all your shit or you're in trouble.
[1208.70s -> 1217.05s]  All right. What do tea leaves do? Do I research it?
[1221.96s -> 1226.01s]  Yeah. All your stuff. This seems pretty well-made so far.
[1227.13s -> 1229.61s]  Yeah. I told you guys. I was very clear.
[1230.33s -> 1235.40s]  Yeah, this is a sponsored stream, but this game looks really fun.
[1235.96s -> 1238.50s]  I was interested from the get-go.
[1238.50s -> 1246.73s]  This hats. How do I get new hats?
[1246.73s -> 1249.61s]  Ooh. Remove corruption from 12 creatures.
[1249.61s -> 1252.66s]  Catch 25 fish in water banks. This fishing.
[1252.66s -> 1254.26s]  Buy five items from the merchant.
[1254.26s -> 1258.47s]  Discover 15 creatures in the journal. That's cool.
[1259.03s -> 1263.53s]  I only have the regular hat. All right. So let's go.
[1263.53s -> 1265.93s]  Let's go. Should I cook some food? I already have food, right?
[1266.49s -> 1272.50s]  Anything else I didn't see? What was this?
[1272.50s -> 1277.21s]  Can I do this? I think I, okay. Well, that didn't work.
[1277.21s -> 1281.14s]  Use left bumper to block and it's right trigger to attack.
[1281.14s -> 1286.58s]  And then right bumper is sort of an ingredients list. Cool.
[1286.58s -> 1289.14s]  This is the, all right. Why is inventory?
[1289.14s -> 1294.09s]  Oh, I can put, all right, hold on. Equip.
[1295.86s -> 1299.29s]  Ah, all right. Okay. Right bumper.
[1300.01s -> 1304.42s]  All right. So if I drink a damage potion, what happens?
[1304.42s -> 1310.44s]  It fucking hurts. You can, okay. I can throw it though.
[1311.00s -> 1318.41s]  What are we doing this? Is it in five damage?
[1318.97s -> 1323.99s]  Well, drink this. Did I just waste a bunch of ingredients?
[1326.87s -> 1329.88s]  Okay. All right. What about the fish over here?
[1329.88s -> 1332.04s]  You need to finish the rest of the stream in the Elmo voice.
[1334.25s -> 1337.53s]  No, dude. Are you serious? No.
[1339.10s -> 1341.83s]  Ooh, fish. I need a fishing rod.
[1346.41s -> 1351.43s]  All right. I got materials. I need a shovel to dig.
[1352.07s -> 1357.19s]  What's this? What's this?
[1357.19s -> 1360.23s]  You know, were it up to me, you would never have come to this place to face something so dangerous.
[1364.41s -> 1367.37s]  To face something so dangerous, but allow me to offer some guidance.
[1367.37s -> 1370.01s]  If nothing else, you'll need to cross the wasteland at some point.
[1371.02s -> 1373.74s]  There's an ancient tree with roots that spread far and wide
[1373.74s -> 1376.30s]  and that tree, it burns with a ruinous flame.
[1377.53s -> 1381.29s]  The corruption, of course, and it won't let you through, not without a fight anyway.
[1387.03s -> 1389.37s]  Good luck. Hope we'll meet again before the end.
[1391.21s -> 1401.61s]  The dev said do Elmo. Is that a lie? Are you making that up?
[1401.61s -> 1403.21s]  To fast travel to another location, select the menu.
[1405.11s -> 1410.50s]  All right. So now what? That was just like a little tutorial design.
[1410.50s -> 1414.86s]  All right. So I'm just going. I'm just going somewhere.
[1415.50s -> 1423.24s]  Stranger. The well is whispering. Can you hear it?
[1424.31s -> 1428.95s]  It does. It does. The bustling murmurs of creation rising fiercely into this realm.
[1429.75s -> 1431.91s]  Don't believe me? He pressed your ears.
[1432.63s -> 1438.54s]  Sorry. Throw a coin, make a wish, and you'll have a glistening remedy against corruption.
[1441.02s -> 1446.65s]  Drop coins. Its words warm you from within.
[1447.29s -> 1453.24s]  Hey, I don't want to. How much money do I have?
[1453.24s -> 1459.10s]  I have eight dollars. Why would I do this? I have eight bucks. What a waste.
[1459.10s -> 1463.46s]  I don't want to do that. What's going on over here?
[1464.02s -> 1469.66s]  This is the pantry, a great place to store food.
[1470.46s -> 1477.32s]  We managed to find human followers. They can feed themselves here.
[1477.40s -> 1482.98s]  Feed followers? Should I cook an apple?
[1486.42s -> 1490.34s]  Hey, bro, a roasted apple. Calm down.
[1490.34s -> 1497.26s]  What about apple? What about an apple braised turkey leg?
[1497.82s -> 1501.38s]  No. Actually, should I just bake these?
[1502.10s -> 1507.58s]  Oh, I don't need wood. OK. I got a baked apple now.
[1507.58s -> 1514.87s]  Who's this? There was someone waiting for me far and away on the other side of the other side.
[1515.51s -> 1519.03s]  But now the farewell pier is hidden, covered by the looming vines, the killer plants,
[1519.03s -> 1526.02s]  the breaker vines. They endure safely from the no more fire for a much needed cleansing.
[1527.51s -> 1529.27s]  Those tall plants, looming vines, he called them.
[1529.27s -> 1531.51s]  Perhaps there is some information to be gained about it nearby.
[1535.45s -> 1538.92s]  Well, that was a bomb. OK. Sorry about that.
[1540.06s -> 1545.85s]  OK, so how do I get through this? OK. Well, don't touch it.
[1545.85s -> 1549.30s]  This is really cute. It is. Yeah, this is really cool.
[1552.74s -> 1558.30s]  I need to be like picking stuff up. This game is all about preparation
[1559.10s -> 1561.02s]  because everything is dangerous, I think, out there.
[1561.74s -> 1565.42s]  So I don't just want to walk out like a dickhead and not have any tools.
[1565.42s -> 1570.94s]  So let me figure that out first. How do I make a shovel?
[1572.14s -> 1578.76s]  Wait, didn't I get a... I did. Portable lab recipe.
[1578.76s -> 1583.98s]  Oh, all right. I can make that now. What about over here?
[1589.70s -> 1596.17s]  Cheese, crusty bread, sunny side up egg. Ooh. Do I sleep?
[1598.95s -> 1608.15s]  I'm going to sleep. Sleep. Oh, I'm holding the button down.
[1608.15s -> 1612.62s]  What is this food meter going down for? Oh, shit. OK.
[1616.33s -> 1624.66s]  Eat an apple. Oh, yep, yep. You have to eat for the stamina bar, right?
[1624.66s -> 1631.06s]  OK, cool, cool, cool, cool. Oh, yeah. More crates.
[1631.06s -> 1636.58s]  What's going on over there? I have so much food.
[1637.58s -> 1641.85s]  You hear threatening growling and barking nearby.
[1641.85s -> 1651.66s]  Those hounds seem to have gone feral and they're fighting each other.
[1651.66s -> 1660.84s]  What? Discover. Those hounds were actually fighting over scraps,
[1660.84s -> 1665.22s]  but this one looks too weak to defend itself. Maybe if it was fed.
[1665.78s -> 1669.54s]  If you want to tame a creature, first, you need to research what they eat
[1669.54s -> 1671.46s]  so you can feed them and earn their trust.
[1672.46s -> 1674.87s]  All research results will be displayed in your journal.
[1674.87s -> 1678.07s]  The more creatures of the same species you find, the more information about them you'll learn.
[1679.27s -> 1684.54s]  All right. Wild dog. To learn more about a creature, select the menu
[1684.54s -> 1691.03s]  and then choose the journal. The journal. Oh, dog.
[1691.96s -> 1695.64s]  Favorite food. Raw meat, choice steak, or baked meat pie.
[1695.64s -> 1702.52s]  I have steak. I just made it. Where is it?
[1702.52s -> 1706.07s]  All right. Choice steak. How do I use it?
[1706.07s -> 1713.10s]  The pound is much better now and seems to have taken a liking to you.
[1713.10s -> 1718.02s]  Perhaps if you fed other animals, they might have a similar reaction.
[1720.02s -> 1726.66s]  Really? Okay. Should I keep feeding them?
[1726.66s -> 1740.60s]  What's up here? Wasteland.
[1740.60s -> 1747.43s]  Just like the old warden said, which means that must be the corrupted tree.
[1747.43s -> 1757.24s]  Hope my Friday's going well. Hope your Friday's going well, too.
[1759.99s -> 1762.55s]  He's starving. I'll feed him. I'm going to take care of him.
[1762.55s -> 1774.57s]  What's going on? There must be some way to heal that maelstrom and clear the passage.
[1774.57s -> 1779.98s]  I have to heal it? All right.
[1780.98s -> 1788.54s]  Reach the corrupted tree. Did I prepare? Do I have any food?
[1789.26s -> 1791.10s]  All right. I have aloe. I have crusty.
[1791.10s -> 1797.00s]  All right. I need to equip the crusty bread. Can I use this as a weapon?
[1797.64s -> 1801.61s]  Okay. I can use the bread as a weapon. This is some stale ass bread.
[1801.61s -> 1809.91s]  Will it actually work? What's this? Oh, turnips.
[1811.03s -> 1816.36s]  A mandragore. What the fuck?
[1816.36s -> 1823.50s]  What's going on? Hey, how do I pick this up?
[1824.06s -> 1829.80s]  Oh, I got it. A mandragore obtained.
[1830.44s -> 1833.06s]  The chest up here. Ow.
[1833.94s -> 1837.24s]  Do I have to get hurt by this? All right. I think I have to take the damage.
[1837.88s -> 1841.72s]  Was it worth it? I need a pick lock for this.
[1843.06s -> 1846.89s]  What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?
[1847.53s -> 1855.35s]  All right. Another mandragore. Okay.
[1855.35s -> 1860.12s]  Oh, I need wood. I can chop the trees down. I need an axe.
[1861.56s -> 1867.99s]  What's wrong with me? I'm going to die. What's going on?
[1872.33s -> 1877.46s]  Oh, I'm taking tick damage. I can't die in the first...
[1877.46s -> 1885.59s]  I'm dead. Okay.
[1885.59s -> 1892.44s]  We just had to see what happened when you died. We had to see what happened.
[1892.44s -> 1895.32s]  After perishing, you'll be returned to a safe location like the house.
[1896.04s -> 1897.72s]  Your belongings, however, will not.
[1898.36s -> 1901.88s]  Your items will remain in the same spot where you fell, just waiting for you to pick them up.
[1902.74s -> 1904.58s]  If you fall again, they'll be gone forever.
[1906.86s -> 1909.34s]  Okay. Well, I had a lot of stuff, I think. I got to go get it right now.
[1916.81s -> 1920.73s]  Where's my stamina bar? Shit.
[1921.77s -> 1930.31s]  Okay. I have no... I don't have a stamina bar.
[1932.54s -> 1935.98s]  All right. Where's my stuff? Okay. Over here.
[1937.19s -> 1940.07s]  Okay. I got to go. Where was it? What's this 20% thing at the top?
[1940.79s -> 1947.16s]  I was over here. I cleared that.
[1947.80s -> 1956.25s]  I went over this way. There it is. Okay.
[1956.97s -> 1959.21s]  Bag. Take it all. Oh, thank God.
[1959.93s -> 1969.56s]  What is that? What is that? A corrupted chicken?
[1976.63s -> 1978.87s]  What am I supposed to do? What is following me?
[1980.76s -> 1982.60s]  Portable lab has been stolen. What?
[1985.78s -> 1989.38s]  Get out of here. Leave me alone. I don't have a stamina bar.
[1991.90s -> 1995.24s]  What the fuck? He stole my lab.
[1995.96s -> 2002.58s]  Okay. A wild rat. Oh, I'm learning about them.
[2006.30s -> 2011.21s]  Can I... Like, what do I do about this?
[2011.21s -> 2013.88s]  All right. I need to eat something. Just eat all this cheese.
[2018.07s -> 2021.91s]  Only two? All right. Somebody set up egg.
[2025.16s -> 2027.64s]  What is this thing counting? What's the 33%? 33%.
[2029.30s -> 2035.88s]  What's that mean? Ooh. Oh, I got a torch.
[2040.54s -> 2046.06s]  Oh, hell yeah. It's a weapon. On attack, remove three target vitalities.
[2046.06s -> 2048.28s]  This is a weapon. All right. Finally.
[2049.16s -> 2051.56s]  Can I light it? I need to get the lab back.
[2052.20s -> 2066.50s]  How do I get the lab back? He doesn't have anything on his inventory.
[2066.50s -> 2068.18s]  Horus undiscovered. Who's Horus?
[2074.44s -> 2077.88s]  Should I discover Horus? Why am I fighting this thing?
[2084.44s -> 2088.95s]  This shit has durability. Ow, you piece of shit.
[2092.94s -> 2094.86s]  All right. Did you have anything?
[2095.74s -> 2101.91s]  I'm fucking dead. No shit. Don't die from thorns again, please.
[2102.47s -> 2106.95s]  There's a chest in here. Did I get the lab back?
[2109.88s -> 2114.09s]  What is this? Open.
[2114.09s -> 2116.90s]  This chest is sealed with a strange lock and there's an inscription beside it.
[2118.95s -> 2123.03s]  My prize is under protection three, which only the one that glows shall see.
[2126.26s -> 2128.10s]  This is a, I can light this. Can I?
[2134.46s -> 2139.77s]  Does this work? Oh, all right. Cool.
[2140.57s -> 2145.22s]  How long does it last? I don't want to die.
[2147.16s -> 2149.72s]  Moonstone and three textiles. I got to research this.
[2150.36s -> 2156.18s]  It looks like it comes back. I need my research lab.
[2156.18s -> 2160.14s]  Did they actually get rid of it? Yeah, it stole it.
[2160.14s -> 2162.62s]  I can't. That piece of shit actually stole it.
[2163.18s -> 2176.20s]  The rat went south with the lab. I don't want to miss anything.
[2178.04s -> 2182.44s]  So it does seem pretty open. I was curious at like how open
[2183.16s -> 2184.20s]  this stuff was actually going to be.
[2186.42s -> 2190.07s]  There it is. He stole something else.
[2190.87s -> 2196.71s]  Get over here. It's this thing. All right.
[2196.71s -> 2198.15s]  I got my shit back. I got my shit back.
[2199.75s -> 2210.18s]  Give me this lab textiles. Discover wild rat and oh, my crusty bread.
[2210.74s -> 2218.57s]  Where's my weapon? I think it's 60% whatever that is.
[2219.64s -> 2221.96s]  Oh, you can heal by sitting down. That's actually really helpful.
[2222.52s -> 2225.50s]  All right. Let me, let me open up the lab.
[2226.94s -> 2231.40s]  Let's get that lab open portable lab.
[2231.40s -> 2238.06s]  Okay. So I need to research charcoal.
[2238.06s -> 2242.73s]  I need 19 more. Four more feathers and I know what it is.
[2243.37s -> 2246.73s]  Three more mandragores. I have enough tea leaves.
[2246.73s -> 2248.66s]  What is it? Remove.
[2250.84s -> 2258.04s]  So when you go to the crafting table, you do like add something vitality
[2258.04s -> 2261.16s]  or like remove something vital, right? I think that's how it works.
[2261.72s -> 2266.89s]  Do I have any more? Yeah, like add vitality.
[2266.89s -> 2271.22s]  Would that do anything? Sloppy potion.
[2271.22s -> 2273.22s]  No. All right. That didn't work.
[2273.22s -> 2279.24s]  Because you have this four slots. Remove vitality.
[2279.24s -> 2281.64s]  You can probably make like hurt potions, right? All right. That's cool.
[2281.64s -> 2287.11s]  I'll pick it up. Should I burn these?
[2287.11s -> 2293.30s]  Is my torch dead? Shit, it is.
[2293.30s -> 2296.58s]  Okay. I don't have a torch.
[2296.58s -> 2298.90s]  I'm back to using like the chicken leg as a weapon.
[2298.90s -> 2301.72s]  What's my favorite part of the game so far?
[2303.19s -> 2305.83s]  I don't know. I think I needed some more time in it.
[2305.83s -> 2310.50s]  I don't have a pick lock, but all right.
[2310.50s -> 2314.89s]  It seems like you kind of just walk around and collect stuff
[2314.89s -> 2317.37s]  and then make new stuff and then keep going and then get further
[2317.37s -> 2319.53s]  into the game and then make new stuff and then collect more things.
[2320.17s -> 2325.02s]  It seems cool. All right.
[2325.02s -> 2328.10s]  I have plenty of... All right. What's going on here?
[2328.10s -> 2331.85s]  Is this a wild dog? Oh, all right.
[2331.85s -> 2335.85s]  I know more. You have a moonstone?
[2335.85s -> 2344.12s]  Well, this is what you have on you. Moonstone. Ingredient. Shining.
[2344.12s -> 2345.94s]  A special keystone. Bound to the edge.
[2345.94s -> 2351.51s]  Should I try to give this dog a snack? Oh, shit.
[2351.51s -> 2355.13s]  What about... No, no, no. Don't go. Don't go.
[2355.13s -> 2357.69s]  They like meat, right? Come here. Feed.
[2357.69s -> 2367.10s]  What's wrong? You don't want that. You don't? Dog.
[2367.10s -> 2371.50s]  Favorite food. Raw meat. Not raw meat.
[2371.50s -> 2379.42s]  Doesn't like raw meat. I thought I said raw meat.
[2379.42s -> 2382.07s]  Maybe this one doesn't... Maybe this one wants cooked meat.
[2382.07s -> 2384.66s]  Needs a steak. What about... Do you like bread?
[2386.95s -> 2394.38s]  No. I don't want to kill it. I need to cook that steak.
[2394.38s -> 2403.46s]  He's full. All right. I'm going to... I'm just going to eat this.
[2408.68s -> 2415.35s]  That's cool. Anything in here? I need a axe.
[2415.35s -> 2420.17s]  Wait, I think that means... That thing's freaking me out.
[2420.17s -> 2423.05s]  Ninety one percent. Ninety two percent.
[2425.24s -> 2429.22s]  Sealed message. What happens at a hundred percent?
[2434.47s -> 2436.54s]  Wait, material. Fuck.
[2438.12s -> 2445.90s]  Oh, world tomb and inspect in there. Oh, a worm. Another worm.
[2446.46s -> 2451.64s]  Okay. All right. Worms. I needed those to fish.
[2451.64s -> 2454.36s]  This is at 96. What's going on? What happens in the hundred percent?
[2455.00s -> 2467.56s]  What's going on? Ninety nine percent.
[2467.56s -> 2476.10s]  A corruption storm is wiping out the area.
[2477.37s -> 2480.73s]  We'll give... Run! Get out of here! Wait, what?
[2481.69s -> 2484.57s]  What happened? Travel, travel, travel. Fast travel, right?
[2488.30s -> 2490.46s]  I can't fast travel during a storm. How do I get out of here?
[2491.10s -> 2496.84s]  How do I get out of here? Where's the exit?
[2506.81s -> 2510.18s]  Shit. Is that there forever?
[2512.63s -> 2519.69s]  What the hell is that? Does it say what it does?
[2521.29s -> 2525.21s]  Does it give you like a time limit to make it so it's a little more stressful?
[2527.56s -> 2534.46s]  What the... This is a chicken corpse? What are you looking at?
[2534.46s -> 2537.03s]  Clement. Clement has an axe.
[2539.34s -> 2543.40s]  Wait, is there a... Who is this person?
[2547.67s -> 2552.38s]  Clement and this bird are friends. I want that axe.
[2553.10s -> 2555.98s]  Is there like a... Can I steal?
[2556.62s -> 2561.21s]  There's got to be like a steal, right? What are you doing?
[2561.21s -> 2570.68s]  Can I steal it? Don't steal.
[2573.08s -> 2574.68s]  I definitely can steal. All right. Well, fine.
[2574.68s -> 2576.68s]  Are they friends or something? Why are they here?
[2577.32s -> 2580.25s]  All right. I need to... I need an axe.
[2584.06s -> 2591.86s]  I need a weapon. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2591.86s -> 2597.05s]  Oh, okay. Enhance the axe.
[2599.16s -> 2603.58s]  Oh, all right. I can enhance the axe or I can forge.
[2603.58s -> 2605.34s]  All right. Here we go.
[2605.34s -> 2607.74s]  Make or enhance basic instruments with crafting materials.
[2607.74s -> 2612.04s]  Each crafting attempt requires charcoal or a spectral fuel.
[2612.97s -> 2614.57s]  You might need... You need to know the recipe.
[2615.21s -> 2617.37s]  All right. Well, I can't... Let me... Hold on. What's this?
[2619.19s -> 2620.39s]  Eight charcoal. Holy shit.
[2622.97s -> 2629.72s]  There was something like a chop down over here, right? Like right here.
[2630.36s -> 2631.88s]  There was a couple of things I could chop down, right?
[2632.68s -> 2641.10s]  I have no stamina. Logs and cut this.
[2642.06s -> 2647.59s]  I need glass. Okay. Shit.
[2648.15s -> 2653.93s]  I love how good he is at acting like he doesn't know what he's doing.
[2659.40s -> 2662.18s]  I don't. I don't know what I'm doing.
[2663.48s -> 2666.44s]  I played like 15 minutes of the demo.
[2666.44s -> 2669.08s]  I walked around this town and was like, yeah, I think this is going to be fun.
[2669.80s -> 2672.50s]  Yeah, I didn't play the demo for four hours.
[2672.50s -> 2674.26s]  I played the demo for like five to 10 minutes.
[2674.98s -> 2677.59s]  I didn't play the demo for like four hours.
[2678.15s -> 2680.90s]  Oh, what's the axe do?
[2682.90s -> 2685.06s]  I'm not sure. I don't know. What's the axe do?
[2685.86s -> 2694.55s]  Somebody... I'm fine. I'm doing fine.
[2696.50s -> 2700.07s]  Okay. There was something else I needed to cut.
[2700.71s -> 2703.69s]  I remember seeing it. I think it was the trees, right?
[2709.75s -> 2710.87s]  Do you keep your money? You do.
[2716.81s -> 2718.17s]  All right. Now that I actually have a weapon,
[2719.54s -> 2724.26s]  I'm going to go back out and I'm going to be fine.
[2724.26s -> 2726.34s]  What's the game? The game is called The Serpent Rogue.
[2726.34s -> 2733.96s]  It's available for PlayStation 5, Xbox, X, Switch, Steam.
[2733.96s -> 2738.28s]  It's pretty much on everything. Are we friends?
[2740.50s -> 2742.42s]  Not yet. He's hungry.
[2743.06s -> 2744.18s]  I got to get my food and come back.
[2744.82s -> 2749.58s]  Now it's on. It's on everything.
[2750.14s -> 2752.74s]  All right. Well, this is where I did.
[2752.74s -> 2754.02s]  Okay. 32. I get it.
[2754.02s -> 2754.82s]  So I'm at 32%.
[2755.54s -> 2756.90s]  I got to get out of here before that gets all the way up.
[2756.90s -> 2760.06s]  I get it. That's an interesting mechanic.
[2761.64s -> 2763.16s]  So you have a finite amount of time.
[2766.01s -> 2770.20s]  I need to eat something right now.
[2770.20s -> 2775.85s]  Baked apple and cheese, bread, eggs.
[2777.26s -> 2778.70s]  I need to cook this shit.
[2778.70s -> 2780.06s]  I shouldn't just be eating it raw.
[2780.70s -> 2785.96s]  Okay. There's a lot of logs.
[2786.60s -> 2792.90s]  Okay. I don't want to break the axe.
[2793.91s -> 2794.79s]  Does it really matter?
[2794.79s -> 2795.83s]  All right. Wait, what's this up here?
[2801.45s -> 2802.25s]  I have to clear this.
[2802.81s -> 2809.24s]  A corrupted beast.
[2809.24s -> 2811.40s]  Fight it or cure it. The only way is through.
[2815.70s -> 2820.09s]  Cure it with a sunny side up egg.
[2827.45s -> 2828.97s]  Do you think? All right.
[2828.97s -> 2830.49s]  I don't think I want to fight this thing.
[2834.25s -> 2835.13s]  Should I discover it?
[2835.77s -> 2836.94s]  Can I discover it?
[2837.50s -> 2838.42s]  Discover it.
[2839.06s -> 2842.18s]  Oh, fuck. Okay. Do not.
[2845.35s -> 2849.46s]  Oh, chicken. No.
[2850.42s -> 2852.26s]  I probably shouldn't have done that either.
[2852.26s -> 2853.62s]  I probably shouldn't have done that either.
[2854.58s -> 2855.54s]  All right. Get out of here.
[2856.10s -> 2861.85s]  So many horrors.
[2863.51s -> 2864.71s]  I can heal them.
[2864.71s -> 2865.11s]  What's this?
[2869.74s -> 2870.86s]  Diagro. Get away from me.
[2871.50s -> 2872.46s]  Oh, my God.
[2872.46s -> 2873.26s]  There's gold over there.
[2877.88s -> 2878.76s]  There's gold right here.
[2879.40s -> 2880.20s]  How do I get this gold?
[2880.76s -> 2882.30s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[2882.30s -> 2883.10s]  There's golden eggs here.
[2888.02s -> 2888.98s]  Get away from me.
[2890.55s -> 2892.55s]  Use. I just used aloe on that dog.
[2899.13s -> 2899.93s]  Such a heavy burden.
[2899.93s -> 2900.81s]  You're carrying too much weight,
[2900.81s -> 2903.21s]  resulting in slow movement and inability to fast travel.
[2912.34s -> 2913.94s]  All right. I got to go get all that stuff.
[2913.94s -> 2915.46s]  Okay. I got to go grab some potions.
[2916.42s -> 2917.14s]  Fuck.
[2917.14s -> 2921.14s]  When back to our world, are you strange?
[2921.14s -> 2922.74s]  Usually takes you a bit longer to return.
[2923.30s -> 2925.46s]  Of course, I know about you.
[2925.46s -> 2926.42s]  I'm the Undertaker.
[2927.62s -> 2929.14s]  I tend to the lost and the fallen.
[2929.78s -> 2931.78s]  Well, except you.
[2931.78s -> 2934.18s]  You're more of a fond and a risen.
[2934.74s -> 2935.86s]  Never seen nothing like it.
[2936.50s -> 2938.87s]  But I know metal, like they say,
[2938.87s -> 2940.07s]  let bygones be bygones.
[2940.07s -> 2942.07s]  So bye and gone now.
[2942.71s -> 2947.00s]  You don't want no ghouls.
[2947.72s -> 2950.28s]  The Undertaker can perform different actions
[2950.28s -> 2952.12s]  to help you with felled creatures.
[2952.68s -> 2955.00s]  Clear location.
[2955.00s -> 2957.00s]  Clear any location of hollow creatures.
[2957.80s -> 2961.18s]  The Undertaker will need only a shovel for this service.
[2963.06s -> 2963.86s]  Or resurrect.
[2963.86s -> 2965.62s]  Bring back recently fallen allies
[2965.62s -> 2966.90s]  in exchange for some gold coins.
[2969.77s -> 2970.33s]  Interesting.
[2970.33s -> 2971.45s]  You clear bodies?
[2974.55s -> 2975.35s]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[2976.42s -> 2978.34s]  Okay. I need to go get my stuff and come back here
[2978.34s -> 2978.74s]  because I...
[2979.62s -> 2980.34s]  Whoa. Where am I?
[2983.98s -> 2984.78s]  Oh, I'm over here.
[2989.70s -> 2990.34s]  World tomb.
[2991.86s -> 2992.66s]  What does this get me?
[2993.82s -> 2995.74s]  Use information about this realm.
[2998.20s -> 2999.40s]  I got Undertaker lore.
[2999.40s -> 3000.44s]  Oh, it's like little lore books.
[3000.44s -> 3000.94s]  I get it.
[3001.40s -> 3004.26s]  All right. Let me pick up some shit over here.
[3008.12s -> 3009.64s]  Deal with the Val Raven.
[3010.20s -> 3015.50s]  All right. I can stop dying over and over again.
[3016.06s -> 3019.43s]  I love the music.
[3019.43s -> 3020.31s]  The music is really good.
[3020.95s -> 3022.63s]  What about your house?
[3025.50s -> 3026.14s]  Cool.
[3026.14s -> 3027.74s]  Something's inside.
[3027.74s -> 3028.54s]  How can I open this?
[3029.10s -> 3031.99s]  What's that?
[3031.99s -> 3039.32s]  I need a lockpick.
[3040.04s -> 3041.45s]  I don't have any food.
[3042.25s -> 3044.23s]  Yeah. I got to get some new recipes or something.
[3044.23s -> 3045.91s]  I got to stop dying out in that world.
[3046.63s -> 3049.37s]  How do I get that?
[3050.09s -> 3056.50s]  Oh, I have an idea.
[3057.06s -> 3066.15s]  Will this work?
[3066.15s -> 3069.91s]  Can I like throw it into the chandelier?
[3069.91s -> 3077.30s]  I don't think so.
[3078.02s -> 3079.85s]  How do I knock that down?
[3083.32s -> 3085.80s]  Look, it's at least he's getting sponsored by a game
[3085.80s -> 3086.68s]  that actually looks pretty fun.
[3086.68s -> 3087.56s]  So that is some bullshit.
[3087.56s -> 3088.36s]  That's what I'm saying.
[3089.08s -> 3092.12s]  Yeah. This is I'm saying this is pretty fun.
[3092.92s -> 3093.96s]  I did my research.
[3094.52s -> 3103.54s]  I'll go back to him.
[3103.54s -> 3106.68s]  This is, yeah, this is sponsored.
[3111.78s -> 3115.96s]  Okay. I was overburdened, which is interesting.
[3117.46s -> 3120.31s]  Um, looks good.
[3120.31s -> 3120.87s]  It does look, yeah.
[3120.87s -> 3128.06s]  The game looks good.
[3128.06s -> 3128.86s]  What can I make?
[3129.50s -> 3131.98s]  I just got to, I got to go get my shit.
[3132.62s -> 3133.58s]  All right. Go, go, go, go, go.
[3133.58s -> 3134.14s]  Go get your stuff.
[3137.30s -> 3139.46s]  I need raw, I mean, I need meat for the dog
[3139.46s -> 3141.14s]  because the dog needs like to eat one more.
[3141.70s -> 3142.26s]  Are you okay?
[3142.26s -> 3145.34s]  The dog's really hungry.
[3145.34s -> 3146.54s]  All right. Dog is very hungry.
[3146.54s -> 3152.39s]  What's this? Eggs?
[3152.39s -> 3155.08s]  Ooh, egg, shell.
[3155.64s -> 3157.77s]  What's in here?
[3157.77s -> 3160.95s]  This looks like an animal feeder
[3160.95s -> 3162.95s]  could come in handy when nourishing tamed creatures.
[3162.95s -> 3163.99s]  If you can get some in here.
[3165.40s -> 3172.20s]  Ah, is this game open world?
[3173.29s -> 3175.69s]  I, yeah, this feels pretty open world to me.
[3178.38s -> 3182.97s]  Open world, crafting, dangerous, risky.
[3183.85s -> 3184.97s]  You can lose all your stuff.
[3186.18s -> 3187.14s]  It checks a lot.
[3187.14s -> 3188.58s]  It's 87% right now.
[3188.58s -> 3190.26s]  I got to get my stuff and get out of here.
[3190.26s -> 3191.75s]  Where is it?
[3194.81s -> 3196.73s]  Yeah, I got to bring this stuff back and research it.
[3196.73s -> 3197.37s]  Where's my stuff?
[3202.74s -> 3203.62s]  Shit, I don't know.
[3203.62s -> 3204.58s]  It's up here somewhere, right?
[3206.54s -> 3208.30s]  He's lying down right next to it.
[3208.30s -> 3209.02s]  Come on.
[3209.02s -> 3209.58s]  All right.
[3209.58s -> 3210.86s]  I have no stamina, but I can get it.
[3214.33s -> 3215.53s]  Wait, I'm going to be overburdened.
[3220.90s -> 3222.66s]  These are supposed to be damaged potions.
[3223.22s -> 3224.34s]  I'm going to be overburdened.
[3228.55s -> 3228.79s]  All right.
[3228.79s -> 3231.77s]  Just how do I drop stuff?
[3231.77s -> 3232.25s]  How do I drop?
[3235.34s -> 3235.74s]  I'm dead.
[3237.22s -> 3239.56s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3239.56s -> 3240.28s]  Just drop everything.
[3240.28s -> 3240.76s]  Oh my God.
[3240.76s -> 3241.24s]  I'm dead again.
[3241.48s -> 3242.20s]  This stuff is dead.
[3242.20s -> 3242.84s]  This stuff is gone.
[3243.64s -> 3245.08s]  This stuff is actually gone.
[3245.88s -> 3247.42s]  I couldn't run.
[3247.42s -> 3248.14s]  I was overburdened.
[3249.27s -> 3249.83s]  Fuck.
[3249.83s -> 3250.55s]  All right.
[3250.55s -> 3252.07s]  It's surrounded by animals.
[3252.07s -> 3252.95s]  I can't.
[3252.95s -> 3253.27s]  Okay.
[3253.83s -> 3255.42s]  What do I do about this?
[3258.81s -> 3260.17s]  I think I just have to lose that.
[3263.10s -> 3264.06s]  Will the undertaker help?
[3265.99s -> 3266.31s]  Okay.
[3267.19s -> 3268.55s]  He's camping my gear.
[3269.35s -> 3272.07s]  That guy's camping my gear and it's not fair.
[3279.74s -> 3280.78s]  He followed me around.
[3280.78s -> 3281.82s]  He camping me.
[3281.82s -> 3282.78s]  He's camping me.
[3287.43s -> 3288.31s]  Okay.
[3288.31s -> 3293.98s]  Should I wait?
[3293.98s -> 3296.28s]  Maybe I'll go to sleep.
[3302.79s -> 3303.59s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[3303.59s -> 3304.55s]  I can do this.
[3304.55s -> 3309.90s]  Corruption Storm was wiping out this air.
[3309.90s -> 3310.22s]  Wait.
[3310.22s -> 3311.42s]  This one that I'm in right now?
[3315.82s -> 3316.06s]  What?
[3316.62s -> 3324.36s]  Okay.
[3324.36s -> 3325.40s]  Looming vines.
[3325.40s -> 3326.20s]  I'll read that later.
[3326.20s -> 3326.44s]  Wait.
[3326.44s -> 3327.48s]  Would this actually come over here?
[3330.31s -> 3331.43s]  I got so screwed.
[3331.43s -> 3331.91s]  I died.
[3334.49s -> 3334.97s]  Oh, okay.
[3334.97s -> 3335.37s]  It's gone.
[3335.93s -> 3337.69s]  Okay.
[3337.69s -> 3338.89s]  The plan is there.
[3339.61s -> 3341.37s]  I'm going to go pick up my stuff.
[3342.41s -> 3342.73s]  No.
[3342.73s -> 3343.45s]  I have a better idea.
[3345.22s -> 3345.78s]  I'm going to...
[3346.58s -> 3347.14s]  Is there a sneak?
[3351.61s -> 3353.37s]  That guy's lying down next to my backpack.
[3354.01s -> 3357.90s]  Any more food?
[3364.49s -> 3365.13s]  He's lying.
[3365.13s -> 3365.45s]  Look at him.
[3365.45s -> 3366.89s]  He's lying down next to my backpack.
[3369.58s -> 3370.06s]  I can't...
[3370.06s -> 3370.86s]  If I pick that up...
[3370.86s -> 3371.90s]  I was going to pick up the randoms.
[3371.90s -> 3372.30s]  I got to run.
[3372.94s -> 3373.70s]  Here we go.
[3373.70s -> 3374.02s]  Ready?
[3374.58s -> 3381.27s]  All right.
[3381.27s -> 3382.15s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3382.15s -> 3382.63s]  I'll drop it off.
[3382.63s -> 3383.11s]  I'll drop it off.
[3383.75s -> 3387.69s]  Just get him away from it.
[3394.57s -> 3394.81s]  Okay.
[3395.37s -> 3401.93s]  Okay.
[3401.93s -> 3403.77s]  Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[3403.77s -> 3405.02s]  All right.
[3405.02s -> 3406.30s]  Now I'm going to go turn this in.
[3412.04s -> 3412.20s]  Okay.
[3412.20s -> 3412.92s]  We're good.
[3412.92s -> 3416.87s]  No, I don't want to take all.
[3416.87s -> 3418.47s]  If I take all, I'm going to be over encumbered
[3418.47s -> 3420.07s]  and I'm going to be walking like two miles per hour
[3420.07s -> 3421.03s]  and he's going to kill me.
[3421.03s -> 3423.83s]  When a creature becomes restless,
[3423.83s -> 3426.71s]  their base stats change and they gain strength
[3426.71s -> 3428.23s]  but also lose stamina.
[3428.23s -> 3430.57s]  Make sure to keep an eye on your followers
[3430.57s -> 3431.37s]  when they are in this state
[3431.37s -> 3433.13s]  as they turn to ashes when felled.
[3433.13s -> 3433.85s]  What?
[3433.85s -> 3438.22s]  What's wrong with me?
[3440.07s -> 3440.79s]  What happened to me?
[3440.79s -> 3441.27s]  What happened?
[3441.27s -> 3442.31s]  Why am I a skeleton?
[3444.76s -> 3446.04s]  I turned into a skeleton.
[3448.63s -> 3448.79s]  Okay.
[3448.79s -> 3450.31s]  Let me go back here and deposit this.
[3452.36s -> 3453.64s]  I turned into a skeleton.
[3457.78s -> 3458.66s]  All right.
[3458.66s -> 3459.86s]  Let me put this stuff away
[3462.22s -> 3463.26s]  and then I'm going to dump this
[3463.26s -> 3464.14s]  and go get more of it.
[3464.70s -> 3467.80s]  Zura, do I have a container here?
[3468.52s -> 3471.85s]  You turn into a skeleton when you die?
[3474.30s -> 3475.18s]  I've died a couple of times.
[3475.18s -> 3476.54s]  Maybe I'm dying too much.
[3476.54s -> 3477.26s]  What have I said down?
[3478.14s -> 3479.82s]  The restless never tire.
[3481.82s -> 3482.14s]  Oh.
[3482.94s -> 3485.94s]  Oh, shit.
[3485.94s -> 3486.26s]  Okay.
[3486.82s -> 3488.50s]  Now, let me drop this up.
[3497.78s -> 3498.26s]  I can't.
[3498.26s -> 3499.86s]  I don't have any stamina anymore.
[3499.86s -> 3504.20s]  Is there no more requests?
[3504.84s -> 3506.42s]  Okay.
[3507.06s -> 3508.09s]  Drop this to the house.
[3513.29s -> 3513.77s]  Very cool.
[3513.77s -> 3514.01s]  All right.
[3514.01s -> 3514.41s]  Research.
[3514.97s -> 3516.02s]  There we go.
[3516.02s -> 3521.46s]  Charcoal, sulfur, shells.
[3522.26s -> 3523.82s]  Do I not?
[3523.82s -> 3525.58s]  I don't have a potion yet that I've learned.
[3527.32s -> 3527.80s]  Not yet.
[3528.44s -> 3529.69s]  All right.
[3529.69s -> 3531.13s]  Let's dump some of this stuff here.
[3533.67s -> 3534.15s]  Okay.
[3534.15s -> 3534.39s]  What?
[3535.67s -> 3536.47s]  How do I use this?
[3537.19s -> 3539.61s]  All right.
[3539.61s -> 3540.01s]  Switch it.
[3540.01s -> 3541.77s]  I want to put away like all these berries.
[3542.81s -> 3547.46s]  I'm 25 out of 40.
[3548.18s -> 3549.54s]  I'll keep the logs away.
[3549.54s -> 3550.02s]  They're heavy.
[3550.58s -> 3551.86s]  Scrap.
[3552.58s -> 3553.62s]  Portable app I'll keep.
[3554.18s -> 3556.39s]  I don't know if these damage potions really do anything.
[3557.11s -> 3557.91s]  All right.
[3557.91s -> 3558.71s]  Now I'm more confident.
[3558.71s -> 3559.51s]  I'll go in there and get it.
[3564.55s -> 3564.79s]  Okay.
[3565.43s -> 3566.31s]  I should have enough room now.
[3566.95s -> 3573.46s]  So the food doesn't do anything either.
[3573.46s -> 3579.66s]  But the portable app.
[3579.66s -> 3594.98s]  I should be able to carry everything now.
[3594.98s -> 3596.10s]  Your guy ain't ripped.
[3596.10s -> 3597.46s]  He'll die in two.
[3597.46s -> 3597.70s]  Yeah.
[3599.24s -> 3600.60s]  I should be able to go pick up the rest of this.
[3600.60s -> 3604.52s]  And then I need to pick up more stuff to examine.
[3604.52s -> 3604.76s]  Right?
[3605.48s -> 3609.18s]  I didn't pick up my weapon, did I?
[3611.10s -> 3612.14s]  No, but I'm going to carry these.
[3613.03s -> 3613.35s]  Okay.
[3615.82s -> 3616.86s]  Scary guys over there.
[3621.38s -> 3624.18s]  So these are they're just animals but they're like corrupted.
[3626.09s -> 3626.81s]  Please don't kill me.
[3631.64s -> 3632.60s]  You can heal them.
[3633.53s -> 3635.21s]  I need to learn how to make like a healing potion.
[3636.60s -> 3637.16s]  Where's my stuff?
[3637.80s -> 3641.24s]  Don't kill me.
[3641.24s -> 3647.78s]  Goodbye.
[3647.78s -> 3651.70s]  There's a chest right here.
[3652.26s -> 3653.45s]  All right.
[3653.45s -> 3654.33s]  Don't take too much shit.
[3654.33s -> 3655.05s]  Don't take too much stuff.
[3655.05s -> 3655.77s]  I got to get out of here.
[3656.89s -> 3658.46s]  All right.
[3658.46s -> 3658.70s]  Get me out.
[3658.70s -> 3659.18s]  Get me out.
[3659.18s -> 3659.74s]  Fast travel.
[3661.50s -> 3662.22s]  Oh crap.
[3671.08s -> 3671.48s]  All right.
[3671.48s -> 3671.88s]  I'm good.
[3674.12s -> 3675.64s]  Now I actually can research.
[3675.64s -> 3676.84s]  I'm getting out of here.
[3676.84s -> 3678.68s]  How do I heal this skeleton problem?
[3680.89s -> 3682.09s]  How do I get rid of the skeleton?
[3682.09s -> 3682.89s]  I'm looking at my skeleton.
[3683.45s -> 3686.87s]  All right.
[3686.87s -> 3688.07s]  I can research more.
[3688.07s -> 3691.06s]  How do I get that?
[3691.70s -> 3692.54s]  Oh wait.
[3694.12s -> 3694.44s]  Really?
[3695.00s -> 3697.53s]  I can't just like shake it loose.
[3697.53s -> 3698.31s]  Crawl.
[3698.31s -> 3699.27s]  Looks like a rat hole.
[3699.75s -> 3702.82s]  I need to cure myself.
[3703.46s -> 3704.68s]  I got to figure out.
[3704.68s -> 3705.48s]  I got to find a cure.
[3707.66s -> 3708.06s]  All right.
[3708.06s -> 3708.38s]  Shell.
[3709.18s -> 3713.96s]  I need one more shell to learn what it does.
[3714.60s -> 3715.78s]  All right.
[3715.78s -> 3716.74s]  How am I doing on stuff?
[3717.46s -> 3721.83s]  I got a lot of eggs.
[3722.39s -> 3725.85s]  Portable lab.
[3725.85s -> 3726.49s]  That's really heavy.
[3726.49s -> 3727.13s]  I should get rid of it.
[3727.85s -> 3730.58s]  I didn't want to drink that potion
[3730.58s -> 3732.50s]  and I'm going to fucking die if I do that again accidentally.
[3736.55s -> 3736.79s]  See.
[3736.79s -> 3736.95s]  Wait.
[3736.95s -> 3737.35s]  What's this?
[3738.15s -> 3739.62s]  Oh yeah.
[3739.62s -> 3740.10s]  I picked that up.
[3740.10s -> 3740.58s]  What is it?
[3744.15s -> 3745.43s]  Sealed message.
[3745.43s -> 3751.80s]  Can I open it?
[3751.80s -> 3752.84s]  Oh shit.
[3752.84s -> 3754.18s]  Hey this glass.
[3754.18s -> 3754.98s]  I got glass.
[3754.98s -> 3755.78s]  Cooking recipe.
[3758.58s -> 3759.06s]  Check this out.
[3759.62s -> 3764.31s]  Did you see the banana bros?
[3767.82s -> 3768.70s]  I have glass, right?
[3769.74s -> 3776.57s]  What's in there?
[3776.57s -> 3776.97s]  Coin.
[3776.97s -> 3777.77s]  Cooking recipe.
[3778.41s -> 3778.97s]  What was that?
[3778.97s -> 3779.37s]  Aging.
[3781.14s -> 3781.94s]  Cooking recipe.
[3783.22s -> 3784.26s]  Rustic apple tart.
[3785.70s -> 3786.90s]  Beef and eggs.
[3786.90s -> 3790.44s]  What else?
[3790.44s -> 3795.59s]  A maturing effect that increases the user's age.
[3802.25s -> 3803.77s]  So somebody can drink this?
[3803.77s -> 3811.03s]  So I can...
[3812.23s -> 3813.19s]  What if I drink this?
[3813.19s -> 3814.23s]  I'm a skeleton already.
[3814.87s -> 3818.74s]  Did I get a new...
[3819.86s -> 3820.54s]  No.
[3820.54s -> 3821.50s]  I got to pick up more stuff.
[3822.14s -> 3822.62s]  Okay.
[3822.62s -> 3823.74s]  Deposit everything.
[3823.74s -> 3825.74s]  Should I just go die somewhere?
[3826.46s -> 3828.94s]  How do I heal?
[3829.66s -> 3831.86s]  Okay.
[3831.86s -> 3833.30s]  I'm going to put most of this stuff away.
[3834.10s -> 3839.59s]  It's a lab away too.
[3839.59s -> 3840.07s]  I don't need it.
[3840.87s -> 3841.67s]  Textiles.
[3841.67s -> 3842.07s]  Torch.
[3845.06s -> 3845.22s]  Yeah.
[3845.22s -> 3846.42s]  Let's go with the fresh tart there.
[3848.33s -> 3849.37s]  Maybe I should keep a few of these.
[3849.37s -> 3850.01s]  Can I eat this?
[3853.13s -> 3853.93s]  I'll keep the torch.
[3854.57s -> 3855.82s]  Oh.
[3855.82s -> 3856.62s]  I'm going to go get fish.
[3857.18s -> 3858.95s]  That sounds like a good idea.
[3858.95s -> 3864.17s]  Do you have a code so we can let the devs know
[3864.17s -> 3865.29s]  that we learned about the game from you?
[3867.58s -> 3867.74s]  No.
[3867.74s -> 3868.30s]  I just get it.
[3869.18s -> 3870.38s]  I don't have like a code or anything.
[3871.51s -> 3871.83s]  Okay.
[3871.83s -> 3872.39s]  Catch fish.
[3873.11s -> 3876.86s]  Did it work?
[3876.86s -> 3877.74s]  Why are they skeletons?
[3880.86s -> 3881.50s]  Fish bone?
[3882.14s -> 3882.55s]  No.
[3882.55s -> 3883.19s]  I want fish.
[3883.19s -> 3883.75s]  Not fish.
[3883.75s -> 3884.47s]  Why are we all dead?
[3885.03s -> 3889.16s]  How many can I catch?
[3889.16s -> 3892.54s]  Should I go to a different water?
[3896.66s -> 3897.78s]  These fish bones are ancient
[3897.78s -> 3898.90s]  but they could work as ingredients
[3898.90s -> 3899.94s]  for advanced potions.
[3900.50s -> 3901.78s]  It's important to be careful not all things
[3901.78s -> 3905.29s]  that hide beneath the surface of treasure.
[3905.29s -> 3905.93s]  Kind of ominous.
[3907.34s -> 3907.66s]  Ooh.
[3907.66s -> 3908.30s]  Raw fishes.
[3913.99s -> 3914.15s]  No.
[3914.15s -> 3914.47s]  Yeah.
[3914.47s -> 3915.03s]  There's no code.
[3917.37s -> 3917.61s]  All right.
[3917.61s -> 3918.01s]  Research.
[3918.57s -> 3921.24s]  Okay.
[3921.24s -> 3922.92s]  I need four more fish bones
[3922.92s -> 3923.48s]  and I'll have...
[3924.12s -> 3924.60s]  All right.
[3924.60s -> 3925.64s]  I'm actually kind of into this.
[3927.93s -> 3928.41s]  Four more.
[3928.89s -> 3930.42s]  I think I have enough.
[3934.63s -> 3935.35s]  One.
[3935.35s -> 3935.59s]  Two.
[3936.31s -> 3939.78s]  The channel description is an affiliate link.
[3939.78s -> 3940.79s]  Yeah.
[3940.79s -> 3941.03s]  Yeah.
[3941.03s -> 3941.83s]  That link should work.
[3942.39s -> 3945.58s]  Yeah.
[3945.58s -> 3947.10s]  I have a panel where if you click the panel
[3947.10s -> 3948.22s]  it'll take you to the store page
[3949.45s -> 3952.55s]  and on the tweet too.
[3952.55s -> 3953.22s]  All right.
[3953.22s -> 3958.71s]  That should be good.
[3958.71s -> 3958.87s]  Yeah.
[3958.87s -> 3961.19s]  It's for pretty much all the major consoles.
[3961.99s -> 3962.79s]  Steam.
[3962.79s -> 3963.51s]  $17.99.
[3963.51s -> 3963.83s]  I don't know.
[3963.83s -> 3965.67s]  I think it's $17.99 on Steam.
[3965.67s -> 3968.68s]  I don't know if it's the same.
[3969.32s -> 3973.24s]  Wait a minute.
[3977.18s -> 3977.42s]  Ten.
[3979.48s -> 3979.72s]  Wait.
[3980.28s -> 3981.14s]  Everybody hold on.
[3981.14s -> 3982.10s]  I think I just figured it out.
[3988.41s -> 3989.29s]  I think I just figured it out.
[3990.89s -> 3991.13s]  Yeah.
[3991.13s -> 3991.69s]  I absolutely did.
[3991.69s -> 3992.09s]  Here we go.
[3992.73s -> 3993.21s]  I got it.
[3993.21s -> 3993.69s]  Check this out.
[3994.65s -> 3994.97s]  Add.
[3996.01s -> 3996.33s]  Ten.
[3997.21s -> 3997.93s]  Vitality.
[3999.06s -> 4007.78s]  Right?
[4007.78s -> 4008.66s]  Make a shitload of them.
[4010.17s -> 4010.49s]  Okay.
[4011.86s -> 4012.10s]  Now.
[4012.90s -> 4014.74s]  What's wrong with me?
[4014.74s -> 4015.30s]  All right.
[4015.30s -> 4016.10s]  Drink that.
[4021.32s -> 4021.64s]  Drink.
[4023.29s -> 4023.69s]  Ugh.
[4024.41s -> 4027.03s]  Why am I still old?
[4027.75s -> 4031.78s]  He's making potions in the bathroom.
[4036.42s -> 4037.14s]  I'm not leaving the house.
[4038.41s -> 4039.21s]  Oh, it's in the wasteland.
[4039.21s -> 4039.45s]  Okay.
[4043.78s -> 4044.98s]  I can't sleep.
[4044.98s -> 4051.27s]  Sorry.
[4051.27s -> 4051.99s]  Wipe my lip again.
[4054.68s -> 4056.04s]  Making potions in the toilet.
[4057.08s -> 4058.30s]  I should cook some.
[4058.30s -> 4058.46s]  All right.
[4058.46s -> 4059.10s]  Let me cook.
[4059.10s -> 4060.06s]  How many eggs can I?
[4060.06s -> 4060.94s]  Can I just cooked egg?
[4062.22s -> 4063.26s]  Oh, all right.
[4063.26s -> 4063.58s]  Let's do.
[4063.58s -> 4064.30s]  Oh, wait.
[4064.30s -> 4064.94s]  I need to do this.
[4065.90s -> 4066.62s]  Beef and eggs.
[4069.67s -> 4070.95s]  Oh, okay.
[4070.95s -> 4073.11s]  So this is one egg and one raw meat.
[4074.07s -> 4076.47s]  Get a beef and eggs and I'll make a shitload of sunny side up eggs.
[4077.27s -> 4081.53s]  Okay.
[4083.58s -> 4085.18s]  So I got beef and eggs.
[4089.67s -> 4090.55s]  Go kick the vines.
[4091.03s -> 4095.93s]  Yeah.
[4095.93s -> 4098.01s]  I need to, I need to not wait.
[4098.01s -> 4099.53s]  I think I have some knowledge on it, right?
[4100.57s -> 4102.97s]  What does this do?
[4116.41s -> 4120.54s]  Oh, I think I'm very overburdened.
[4121.18s -> 4123.02s]  Can I hold the axe as a chicken?
[4123.02s -> 4124.73s]  All right.
[4124.73s -> 4125.45s]  I need to get back.
[4125.45s -> 4131.74s]  I need to get back in the house because I need to deposit some stuff.
[4132.30s -> 4135.62s]  Is there, I'm overburdened with the chicken.
[4136.26s -> 4141.02s]  So you can turn into different animals.
[4146.39s -> 4147.03s]  Can I fly?
[4149.62s -> 4153.10s]  Oh, okay.
[4153.10s -> 4153.58s]  I get it.
[4155.03s -> 4155.27s]  All right.
[4155.27s -> 4157.99s]  Now we're going back out there and I'm going to go collect some more stuff.
[4158.71s -> 4164.87s]  Okay.
[4164.87s -> 4166.63s]  I can't do any of that.
[4167.72s -> 4168.68s]  Anything that is not.
[4168.68s -> 4168.92s]  Okay.
[4168.92s -> 4170.92s]  I have, charcoal has been researched.
[4170.92s -> 4173.50s]  What does charcoal do for me now?
[4173.50s -> 4177.35s]  I think I just know about it.
[4177.35s -> 4180.26s]  Deposit some stuff.
[4180.82s -> 4181.56s]  All right.
[4181.56s -> 4182.36s]  Put this away.
[4182.36s -> 4183.08s]  Put this away.
[4184.73s -> 4185.45s]  Put this away.
[4185.45s -> 4187.85s]  Keep like five ass sunny side up eggs.
[4188.41s -> 4190.70s]  I can probably cook the raw fish.
[4190.70s -> 4191.66s]  Get rid of the logs.
[4191.66s -> 4192.62s]  Beef and eggs keep it.
[4192.62s -> 4193.50s]  Scrap, get rid of it.
[4194.86s -> 4195.98s]  The potions, get rid of it.
[4196.79s -> 4197.03s]  All right.
[4197.03s -> 4201.70s]  I'm at 25 out of 40, which, oh, use that.
[4202.42s -> 4204.07s]  I learned about moonstone.
[4204.71s -> 4206.47s]  And I have a torch.
[4206.47s -> 4206.71s]  All right.
[4206.71s -> 4207.99s]  I'm ready to go back out there.
[4207.99s -> 4211.99s]  I'm ready to check it out.
[4211.99s -> 4222.78s]  What are your thoughts on the game so far?
[4224.33s -> 4226.57s]  I think, I actually think it's really interesting.
[4226.57s -> 4227.61s]  I'm really, it's actually fun.
[4233.27s -> 4233.51s]  Okay.
[4233.51s -> 4235.35s]  When I like die over and over again in a game.
[4236.15s -> 4238.63s]  And I, I don't know, there's like animals and stuff.
[4238.63s -> 4238.87s]  I don't know.
[4238.87s -> 4239.67s]  We'll see.
[4239.67s -> 4242.52s]  Can I do anything with you?
[4243.24s -> 4245.26s]  The wild dog is really hungry, but I don't know.
[4245.26s -> 4246.62s]  I, I cooked all the food.
[4248.07s -> 4249.27s]  Let me go get some meat.
[4249.27s -> 4252.38s]  This time I'm not running straight.
[4252.38s -> 4253.42s]  I'm running to the right.
[4253.42s -> 4256.28s]  It's pretty, it's really relaxing.
[4261.96s -> 4265.96s]  I'm very interested in kind of how elaborate it actually is.
[4265.96s -> 4269.38s]  Cause there's like followers, there's pets.
[4270.18s -> 4271.06s]  You can, what's this?
[4274.89s -> 4276.49s]  Chances coin can be found here.
[4276.49s -> 4280.84s]  Tomato, egg, apple can be found here.
[4281.72s -> 4282.73s]  This is random.
[4284.78s -> 4286.78s]  So wait, there's a chance that that will be there now.
[4287.42s -> 4291.00s]  I still will deal with this shit up here.
[4291.90s -> 4292.14s]  All right.
[4292.14s -> 4293.18s]  We got some wild dogs.
[4293.82s -> 4297.51s]  Four out of 15.
[4298.39s -> 4299.91s]  One of the 15 wild.
[4299.91s -> 4300.47s]  Are they different?
[4301.19s -> 4307.72s]  Investigate the corrupted tree.
[4308.28s -> 4310.07s]  Can I, is that thing there?
[4310.79s -> 4311.59s]  I think the thing's gone.
[4312.31s -> 4318.28s]  Investigate it.
[4318.84s -> 4325.29s]  How do I investigate it?
[4330.66s -> 4331.86s]  I can, I can, hold on.
[4332.58s -> 4333.22s]  I have a question.
[4333.94s -> 4335.58s]  This is a healing potion.
[4336.54s -> 4340.06s]  Can I like throw it at this and will it heal this?
[4342.52s -> 4342.76s]  Right?
[4343.40s -> 4348.09s]  Will this do anything?
[4348.65s -> 4350.60s]  I don't think so.
[4352.18s -> 4352.42s]  All right.
[4352.42s -> 4354.02s]  I gotta be careful that corruption thing's coming.
[4354.02s -> 4355.38s]  Like I'm so, I gotta get some more materials.
[4356.10s -> 4358.74s]  Go look in the hole.
[4364.04s -> 4364.84s]  Put vessel?
[4365.48s -> 4370.68s]  Corruption is specifically, especially powerful, but there's a spot here between the tree roots.
[4371.56s -> 4373.96s]  Something could be placed to heal it from the inside.
[4374.52s -> 4376.30s]  I need to put a vessel there.
[4376.94s -> 4378.65s]  Okay.
[4379.21s -> 4382.76s]  Interesting.
[4383.32s -> 4386.17s]  I'm going over here for a minute.
[4387.13s -> 4392.23s]  There was a chest right here that I get it.
[4392.23s -> 4392.87s]  What's this stuff?
[4393.51s -> 4394.58s]  Fuck you.
[4394.58s -> 4396.34s]  That just scared the shit out of me now I'm poisoned.
[4397.85s -> 4398.25s]  Hold on.
[4398.97s -> 4404.33s]  There's nothing even in there.
[4407.38s -> 4408.66s]  13 ticks of poison.
[4408.66s -> 4409.30s]  How much is it doing?
[4409.30s -> 4409.54s]  One.
[4410.26s -> 4413.30s]  What else was there?
[4413.30s -> 4414.26s]  Something else over here, wasn't there?
[4414.82s -> 4420.02s]  What was that?
[4421.64s -> 4422.44s]  Swamplich.
[4424.20s -> 4424.84s]  What do you like?
[4425.40s -> 4426.36s]  Do you like stuff?
[4426.92s -> 4429.85s]  Can I have this as a pet?
[4430.41s -> 4433.98s]  That's kind of cool.
[4434.54s -> 4437.06s]  For now, I want more materials.
[4437.06s -> 4439.38s]  I feel like it's about, that guy has a shovel and I'm going to kill him for it.
[4440.10s -> 4444.26s]  That guy has a shovel and I need it and I'm going to take it from him.
[4452.10s -> 4452.98s]  Do not kill me.
[4455.80s -> 4457.56s]  If this guy kills me with a shovel, I'm going to be pissed.
[4459.56s -> 4459.88s]  Stop.
[4465.10s -> 4466.22s]  Wait, mine's been broke?
[4466.78s -> 4468.46s]  I'm good.
[4468.46s -> 4471.50s]  Shovel, egg, and an axe recipe.
[4471.50s -> 4472.22s]  Oh, there we go.
[4472.22s -> 4472.86s]  That's what I want.
[4473.50s -> 4474.31s]  Okay.
[4474.31s -> 4475.35s]  I know I can make an axe.
[4475.99s -> 4477.99s]  I have the shovel, the stuff that I can dig up.
[4479.67s -> 4479.91s]  Cool.
[4483.21s -> 4483.69s]  I got a minute.
[4484.33s -> 4485.77s]  I don't have any worms.
[4486.57s -> 4488.31s]  Oh, hello.
[4488.87s -> 4489.56s]  Okay.
[4489.56s -> 4490.44s]  I learned more about you.
[4492.30s -> 4492.70s]  Very cool.
[4493.26s -> 4496.60s]  I did more damage with my hands.
[4496.60s -> 4497.56s]  That's kind of funny.
[4504.46s -> 4504.78s]  All right.
[4504.78s -> 4506.22s]  I'm going to go back and make an axe.
[4508.81s -> 4512.46s]  No, I need aging.
[4512.46s -> 4521.30s]  Oh, I need to make an axe and I have to come and kill this thing.
[4522.02s -> 4522.90s]  That's the play.
[4523.46s -> 4529.67s]  The play is to make an axe, make some potions, and then come kill this thing.
[4537.51s -> 4538.15s]  You need to cure it.
[4538.15s -> 4538.71s]  Don't kill it.
[4540.95s -> 4543.51s]  I need, I don't have enough materials to do that.
[4543.51s -> 4544.63s]  Wait, pick these up.
[4546.60s -> 4548.20s]  I could have just walked over there.
[4548.84s -> 4550.57s]  Are you serious?
[4551.75s -> 4553.03s]  I walked up the other side.
[4555.06s -> 4559.22s]  So if I make a bunch of healing potions, I can cure that instead of kill it.
[4562.07s -> 4562.31s]  All right.
[4562.31s -> 4563.67s]  I need to get materials.
[4565.85s -> 4569.61s]  It's aloe and then some fish bones.
[4569.61s -> 4569.85s]  All right.
[4575.18s -> 4578.82s]  More rats, wild rat.
[4580.98s -> 4584.10s]  You can learn about them and then eventually you can tame them, I think.
[4589.19s -> 4591.99s]  Sword can be found here on random chance.
[4591.99s -> 4592.87s]  I would love a sword.
[4596.86s -> 4597.42s]  All right.
[4597.42s -> 4598.38s]  I'm not messing around here.
[4600.23s -> 4602.07s]  What the fuck is that thing?
[4602.07s -> 4603.35s]  What is that thing?
[4603.35s -> 4604.95s]  Is that thing, is that thing hostile?
[4608.17s -> 4608.81s]  A fawn.
[4609.45s -> 4613.93s]  Let's get a bunch of chicken friends on learn about them.
[4616.54s -> 4616.86s]  Chicken.
[4624.71s -> 4625.67s]  I'm not fucking with that.
[4627.77s -> 4628.01s]  All right.
[4628.01s -> 4628.49s]  I got to leave.
[4629.53s -> 4631.29s]  Bring sanctum to the cursed tree.
[4632.01s -> 4633.00s]  All right.
[4633.00s -> 4633.64s]  I got to get out of here.
[4639.05s -> 4640.09s]  Oh, another message.
[4640.65s -> 4641.85s]  These have recipes in them.
[4641.85s -> 4642.09s]  All right.
[4642.09s -> 4642.65s]  Get me out of here.
[4643.62s -> 4644.98s]  Sit back.
[4644.98s -> 4645.22s]  All right.
[4645.22s -> 4645.78s]  Cool.
[4645.78s -> 4647.14s]  I think I made some progress.
[4656.15s -> 4657.27s]  I think that means I'm wet.
[4657.91s -> 4663.32s]  They're all going to die of corruption.
[4663.32s -> 4663.96s]  I think they leave.
[4667.45s -> 4669.77s]  I need one more mandragora and I know what it does.
[4675.16s -> 4676.84s]  I need fish bones.
[4677.64s -> 4682.09s]  I got all kinds of bullshit in my inventory.
[4682.09s -> 4682.33s]  All right.
[4682.33s -> 4683.53s]  What about making the axe?
[4685.18s -> 4686.38s]  I think I have a lot of materials.
[4687.02s -> 4689.38s]  Did you get chin surgery?
[4689.38s -> 4690.18s]  All right.
[4690.18s -> 4690.66s]  What do you think?
[4690.66s -> 4691.30s]  Do you think it looks good?
[4698.25s -> 4699.13s]  Oh, I need to learn it.
[4700.02s -> 4700.74s]  Axe recipe.
[4701.46s -> 4704.15s]  Do I have any more recipes to dip?
[4704.15s -> 4707.29s]  What's that?
[4708.79s -> 4709.91s]  Stag recipe?
[4710.55s -> 4712.86s]  It's a stag.
[4714.30s -> 4719.74s]  I know how to make a stag.
[4719.74s -> 4720.46s]  What's a stag?
[4725.26s -> 4726.62s]  Wood, wood, wood.
[4726.62s -> 4727.42s]  What is a stag?
[4729.00s -> 4729.96s]  I have that, don't I?
[4730.84s -> 4732.30s]  Why is it not my inventory?
[4732.86s -> 4739.67s]  I thought I had some scrap metal.
[4740.39s -> 4740.87s]  Did I not?
[4741.75s -> 4751.45s]  I'm sorry.
[4751.45s -> 4752.57s]  I know I'm supposed to be feeding you.
[4753.29s -> 4756.63s]  All right.
[4756.63s -> 4758.07s]  Well, I can't do that anyways.
[4758.07s -> 4758.71s]  Can't sleep.
[4759.27s -> 4763.08s]  So I did it.
[4763.08s -> 4763.80s]  Was it in the box?
[4764.60s -> 4766.90s]  I think it was in here.
[4767.46s -> 4774.15s]  You're in the food tab at the research table.
[4774.15s -> 4775.59s]  You can change tabs research more.
[4776.62s -> 4776.94s]  Really?
[4778.06s -> 4779.26s]  Well, I've had a bunch of wood.
[4779.26s -> 4779.90s]  I just didn't take it.
[4780.46s -> 4785.13s]  I like watching the funny man.
[4785.13s -> 4785.53s]  Thank you.
[4790.66s -> 4792.42s]  I think it's just whatever you have available.
[4793.22s -> 4794.58s]  But there should be stuff in here.
[4794.58s -> 4795.14s]  Yeah, here we go.
[4796.50s -> 4796.98s]  Just take it.
[4797.78s -> 4801.77s]  So now I should be able to do a bunch more.
[4804.71s -> 4804.95s]  Yeah.
[4804.95s -> 4805.59s]  What about cooking?
[4810.01s -> 4810.65s]  Make a fish?
[4811.88s -> 4812.52s]  Seared fish?
[4813.24s -> 4815.11s]  I'm going to hold on to the eggs
[4815.11s -> 4816.07s]  because I don't want to use all these.
[4816.07s -> 4816.71s]  So let's go back.
[4818.86s -> 4819.42s]  Okay, I have...
[4820.14s -> 4822.02s]  Right, the digging spaces.
[4822.02s -> 4822.26s]  Right.
[4822.26s -> 4822.50s]  Okay.
[4823.38s -> 4825.14s]  There was one back here.
[4825.78s -> 4827.34s]  Where the...
[4827.34s -> 4828.22s]  You should dance for us.
[4831.05s -> 4831.53s]  No.
[4831.53s -> 4831.93s]  Shut up.
[4834.46s -> 4835.66s]  I'm not going to fucking dance.
[4838.76s -> 4839.32s]  No.
[4839.32s -> 4840.12s]  No weird shit.
[4840.12s -> 4841.24s]  This is sponsor segment.
[4842.14s -> 4842.94s]  Ooh.
[4842.94s -> 4844.28s]  What's that?
[4847.99s -> 4848.71s]  I don't have an axe.
[4851.13s -> 4852.97s]  There was stuff to dig over here.
[4852.97s -> 4853.45s]  Wasn't there?
[4855.21s -> 4856.17s]  I swear to God.
[4856.89s -> 4857.75s]  Yeah, there was.
[4859.86s -> 4860.34s]  Ooh, tea.
[4861.06s -> 4863.59s]  I don't feel cold, so I don't eat clothes.
[4863.59s -> 4864.23s]  Who the fuck are you?
[4869.67s -> 4869.99s]  Ooh.
[4873.08s -> 4874.04s]  Create chicken?
[4874.60s -> 4875.64s]  A broom recipe.
[4876.44s -> 4877.93s]  I can make a broom?
[4878.81s -> 4882.50s]  Okay.
[4882.50s -> 4885.46s]  Summon a helpful creature that will come to the user's aid.
[4885.46s -> 4889.10s]  Do I drink this?
[4897.42s -> 4897.74s]  Whoa.
[4900.10s -> 4900.82s]  Bold Lush.
[4904.34s -> 4904.90s]  Inventory.
[4904.90s -> 4905.46s]  Inspect.
[4905.46s -> 4905.86s]  Wait.
[4905.86s -> 4906.74s]  Go to camp.
[4906.74s -> 4907.06s]  Play.
[4910.17s -> 4910.89s]  We can play?
[4913.54s -> 4914.90s]  I've got a bad old chicken, I think.
[4916.82s -> 4918.02s]  I do have a bad old chicken.
[4918.02s -> 4918.58s]  Okay, hold on.
[4919.85s -> 4921.77s]  And the chicken can hold 10 pounds worth of stuff.
[4922.49s -> 4923.45s]  All right.
[4924.44s -> 4925.00s]  All right, cool.
[4925.72s -> 4926.52s]  What's your deal?
[4927.16s -> 4928.20s]  Anastasia.
[4928.20s -> 4929.16s]  What are you looking at?
[4929.16s -> 4932.89s]  I just, I think I'm going to beat this person up.
[4932.89s -> 4934.33s]  I think I'm going to kill this person and take their stuff.
[4935.05s -> 4939.08s]  You want an age potion?
[4939.72s -> 4940.28s]  Let's just do.
[4945.53s -> 4947.29s]  There's also this, which I don't know what to do with this.
[4948.01s -> 4949.77s]  All right, what if I throw the age potion at this?
[4949.77s -> 4950.73s]  Will it age to death?
[4951.37s -> 4954.42s]  That's a decent thought.
[4954.42s -> 4956.36s]  Let's play.
[4957.00s -> 4962.02s]  All right, let's deposit and then go back out with the shovel.
[4963.45s -> 4965.45s]  And I'm going to make an axe.
[4965.45s -> 4968.73s]  And I don't know how to be normal again.
[4968.73s -> 4972.78s]  I have three healing potions.
[4973.34s -> 4975.19s]  Let's deposit this.
[4975.19s -> 4976.07s]  No, actually, I need that.
[4978.54s -> 4979.98s]  All right, deposit a few eggs.
[4980.62s -> 4982.28s]  Deposit the raw fish.
[4982.28s -> 4985.75s]  Get rid of the, get rid of the portable lab.
[4985.75s -> 4986.39s]  It's just too heavy.
[4989.21s -> 4989.93s]  I have the shovel.
[4990.49s -> 4992.17s]  I don't need the tea leaves, that many at least.
[4993.78s -> 4994.10s]  All right.
[4994.10s -> 4994.74s]  Okay, good.
[4994.74s -> 4995.06s]  Let's go.
[4996.18s -> 4998.98s]  Let's see if I can make a, you know what I'm saying?
[5002.50s -> 5003.78s]  Let's make this work.
[5007.99s -> 5009.35s]  I'll put the damage potions over here.
[5010.55s -> 5013.10s]  Oh, it heals the chicken too.
[5013.10s -> 5016.33s]  That's cool.
[5016.33s -> 5019.05s]  Can I make a, is the chicken going to disappear?
[5019.05s -> 5021.94s]  Oh, I don't think there's a timer.
[5021.94s -> 5023.96s]  Doesn't look like it is this timer.
[5032.71s -> 5033.99s]  Okay, axe.
[5033.99s -> 5039.50s]  Can I not make an axe?
[5040.30s -> 5043.69s]  I don't have any wood.
[5043.69s -> 5045.13s]  How do I not have any wood?
[5045.13s -> 5045.69s]  Are you kidding me?
[5046.49s -> 5047.98s]  Didn't I have a shitload of wood?
[5048.62s -> 5050.58s]  What happened to it all?
[5050.58s -> 5054.46s]  Where's all my wood?
[5054.46s -> 5058.36s]  I put it away?
[5059.00s -> 5059.88s]  Did I?
[5059.88s -> 5060.84s]  I thought I just took it out.
[5062.06s -> 5062.70s]  I didn't take it.
[5064.46s -> 5070.66s]  So I should be able to make an axe.
[5074.98s -> 5076.10s]  Who are these weirdos?
[5082.18s -> 5083.54s]  No, see, where is it?
[5084.18s -> 5088.55s]  I had like 10 wood.
[5088.55s -> 5090.62s]  What happened to it?
[5090.62s -> 5098.06s]  I dropped all the rest.
[5098.06s -> 5098.62s]  Oh shit.
[5098.62s -> 5099.58s]  Well, I have a battle chicken.
[5099.58s -> 5100.54s]  I'll be fine.
[5100.54s -> 5102.86s]  Hello, Milton.
[5102.86s -> 5106.02s]  Oh, you have so much stuff.
[5106.02s -> 5107.85s]  I can't just like break this over your head.
[5108.41s -> 5110.73s]  I got a battle chicken.
[5110.73s -> 5111.53s]  I'll be fine.
[5111.53s -> 5116.23s]  Jibber, why are you being so regular?
[5117.94s -> 5125.69s]  I have the shovel.
[5125.69s -> 5126.33s]  I should be okay.
[5126.89s -> 5131.67s]  This is technically a weapon.
[5131.67s -> 5132.63s]  So let's go.
[5132.63s -> 5136.58s]  I need wood and I need more materials
[5136.58s -> 5137.38s]  and I need meat too.
[5137.94s -> 5139.88s]  Okay, let's go.
[5139.88s -> 5145.70s]  All right, follow me.
[5146.42s -> 5149.26s]  Try, just try to kill this thing with a shovel.
[5149.26s -> 5151.90s]  That's going to take me a while to heal this thing to death.
[5151.90s -> 5156.63s]  Now, there's a lot of chickens here.
[5159.22s -> 5160.42s]  All right, discover the chicken.
[5161.06s -> 5162.63s]  Interesting.
[5164.74s -> 5166.34s]  Oh, I need the mandrake worth.
[5170.49s -> 5171.05s]  Watch out.
[5174.34s -> 5178.49s]  Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[5178.49s -> 5179.37s]  Get him, chicken.
[5180.09s -> 5180.92s]  Should I?
[5183.10s -> 5184.54s]  All right, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[5184.54s -> 5185.26s]  Don't get killed.
[5185.26s -> 5186.22s]  Don't get killed, don't get killed.
[5189.19s -> 5190.47s]  I'm going to break this shovel.
[5190.47s -> 5191.19s]  I need it.
[5191.19s -> 5199.14s]  Oh no, the chicken's dead.
[5205.14s -> 5206.66s]  How am I supposed to stop that from happening?
[5208.22s -> 5208.86s]  Inspect?
[5213.40s -> 5213.96s]  Oh no.
[5230.14s -> 5231.02s]  I need the meat.
[5234.49s -> 5235.45s]  I need the meat.
[5235.45s -> 5236.89s]  I need the meat for the dog.
[5236.89s -> 5238.33s]  The dog is starving right now.
[5240.87s -> 5241.27s]  Shit.
[5241.27s -> 5242.23s]  Okay, all right, all right.
[5242.23s -> 5243.11s]  I need to hold digging.
[5250.63s -> 5252.55s]  The dog eats meat.
[5252.55s -> 5253.35s]  I need to feed the dog.
[5253.91s -> 5257.08s]  Still can't open that.
[5257.08s -> 5257.96s]  All right, 69%.
[5259.00s -> 5260.20s]  And there's rats.
[5260.20s -> 5261.24s]  These are corrupted rats.
[5261.24s -> 5266.26s]  Wait, did it work?
[5269.40s -> 5269.80s]  What the?
[5269.80s -> 5270.68s]  It doesn't work.
[5270.68s -> 5271.32s]  I didn't heal him.
[5271.96s -> 5276.81s]  Don't touch me.
[5281.38s -> 5281.86s]  Come here.
[5282.50s -> 5283.14s]  Get over here.
[5284.55s -> 5285.91s]  Healing is not curing?
[5286.47s -> 5289.62s]  Where did that thing go?
[5290.87s -> 5291.35s]  Come here.
[5298.04s -> 5299.00s]  All right, I don't want to die.
[5300.09s -> 5301.37s]  All right, we got lots of meat.
[5302.01s -> 5302.73s]  I got bones.
[5302.73s -> 5303.29s]  This is perfect.
[5303.85s -> 5305.46s]  We'll be able to heal the dog.
[5309.62s -> 5310.50s]  I killed the chicken.
[5311.32s -> 5312.84s]  Well, I didn't mean to kill the chicken.
[5312.84s -> 5314.52s]  The chicken died because it was being attacked.
[5316.01s -> 5319.21s]  Okay, I think I have enough meat to have the dog be my friend.
[5325.05s -> 5325.61s]  Get out of here.
[5325.61s -> 5326.57s]  Leave me alone.
[5326.57s -> 5326.97s]  You know what?
[5327.69s -> 5332.68s]  Okay, discovered that.
[5334.41s -> 5335.77s]  Okay, let's go back and feed the dog.
[5342.33s -> 5344.65s]  You watch me on a hacked smart fridge.
[5344.65s -> 5347.34s]  That's kind of weird.
[5350.46s -> 5352.30s]  Your fists are doing more damage than the shovel.
[5352.86s -> 5355.80s]  So how do I make a cure?
[5356.44s -> 5359.11s]  All right, here we go.
[5360.33s -> 5361.29s]  Mandragora.
[5361.29s -> 5361.93s]  Completely.
[5362.65s -> 5364.01s]  All right, this is change.
[5364.89s -> 5368.62s]  Charcoal is...
[5369.42s -> 5372.09s]  All right, a mandragora is change?
[5372.89s -> 5376.10s]  Something change into something else?
[5376.82s -> 5380.34s]  Interesting.
[5382.01s -> 5382.41s]  Change.
[5382.97s -> 5387.66s]  All right, I need to put in some stuff.
[5388.22s -> 5391.11s]  Maybe heal, change?
[5391.83s -> 5393.56s]  That's possible.
[5394.12s -> 5397.27s]  Let me look at the journal for a second.
[5400.54s -> 5400.86s]  Quest.
[5400.86s -> 5402.14s]  All right, research shell.
[5404.12s -> 5405.32s]  Open the moonstone chest.
[5406.12s -> 5407.72s]  Bring sanctum to the curse tree.
[5407.72s -> 5409.16s]  Feed the well a hundred times.
[5409.80s -> 5410.68s]  Clear the passage.
[5412.63s -> 5413.27s]  No requests.
[5413.27s -> 5413.99s]  All right, hold on.
[5415.75s -> 5416.47s]  Right, here we go.
[5417.27s -> 5420.44s]  Charcoal is age.
[5421.08s -> 5423.45s]  Fish bones are the thing you need.
[5423.45s -> 5425.53s]  It's like a quantity.
[5428.71s -> 5430.31s]  Shells, I think, are also that too.
[5432.14s -> 5433.82s]  All right, I need fish bones and shells.
[5433.82s -> 5436.63s]  That should work.
[5436.63s -> 5444.79s]  German, get weird.
[5445.59s -> 5446.39s]  Act weird.
[5449.29s -> 5450.57s]  I don't need to act weird right now.
[5451.37s -> 5456.63s]  Why I gotta act weird?
[5456.63s -> 5457.75s]  I don't need to act weird.
[5459.30s -> 5460.18s]  You're acting weird.
[5460.18s -> 5460.98s]  You're being weird.
[5461.54s -> 5468.57s]  All right, I should be able to make some more healing.
[5468.57s -> 5470.09s]  I should be able to make some more healing potions.
[5470.65s -> 5471.90s]  Is that weird for you?
[5474.10s -> 5475.46s]  Do you get botox?
[5479.51s -> 5481.27s]  No, I don't.
[5482.41s -> 5483.85s]  I don't get botox.
[5483.85s -> 5485.21s]  Why do people think I get botox?
[5485.77s -> 5488.50s]  Why is it a thing I'm seeing recently?
[5488.50s -> 5491.45s]  Ah, dude, so you get like botox.
[5491.45s -> 5491.69s]  What?
[5493.48s -> 5493.72s]  See?
[5494.36s -> 5496.04s]  You're making me lose materials right now.
[5496.04s -> 5500.04s]  All right, I'm done.
[5500.04s -> 5500.28s]  Look.
[5500.92s -> 5507.51s]  See those wrinkles?
[5508.60s -> 5509.48s]  Too close.
[5509.48s -> 5510.36s]  Way too close.
[5511.16s -> 5512.04s]  Way too close.
[5514.38s -> 5515.02s]  Okay, here we go.
[5515.02s -> 5515.90s]  Vitality, add.
[5516.62s -> 5519.14s]  What about remove 10 vitality, right?
[5522.36s -> 5524.62s]  Add 10 vitality.
[5524.62s -> 5525.90s]  What about remove 10 vitality?
[5525.90s -> 5526.86s]  That's like a damage potion?
[5532.07s -> 5536.31s]  Remove 10 change.
[5536.31s -> 5542.60s]  Okay, all right.
[5542.60s -> 5543.64s]  So I need more aloe.
[5544.20s -> 5544.92s]  Get berries too.
[5547.19s -> 5549.11s]  Okay, that satisfied us for the next 30 minutes.
[5549.11s -> 5549.83s]  Good.
[5549.83s -> 5562.94s]  I'll go ahead and smash her in the head.
[5564.54s -> 5566.06s]  Who is this person?
[5566.06s -> 5566.54s]  Bridget?
[5570.57s -> 5571.77s]  Whoa, you have a snake.
[5571.77s -> 5580.92s]  So what are you doing here?
[5580.92s -> 5582.66s]  Do you want to share this?
[5586.33s -> 5588.81s]  You have two pieces of hair and a shovel.
[5588.81s -> 5592.95s]  What about your little snake friend?
[5592.95s -> 5593.67s]  Snake.
[5593.67s -> 5595.03s]  Oh, I can feed the snake.
[5595.03s -> 5599.53s]  The creature already has a master.
[5603.53s -> 5608.01s]  Yeah, I can't throw this at this lady, right?
[5611.27s -> 5612.87s]  No, I'm going to be a menace.
[5612.87s -> 5613.83s]  I don't want to do that right now.
[5616.73s -> 5617.45s]  I would be a menace.
[5621.98s -> 5624.78s]  I need to get wood and charcoal.
[5628.94s -> 5631.50s]  I need to cure or kill that creature.
[5637.83s -> 5638.63s]  All right, cook.
[5641.22s -> 5642.90s]  I need to make a regular steak to feed the dog.
[5642.90s -> 5644.18s]  And then maybe the dog can come with me.
[5644.90s -> 5652.41s]  The dog can probably come with me.
[5657.29s -> 5658.49s]  A hunger obtained.
[5658.49s -> 5659.53s]  A coin obtained.
[5659.53s -> 5660.01s]  Wait, what?
[5662.89s -> 5664.73s]  Makes the target hungrier.
[5664.73s -> 5667.69s]  What's the application for that?
[5669.93s -> 5670.81s]  I know you want to eat.
[5670.81s -> 5671.13s]  I know.
[5672.12s -> 5672.60s]  I got you.
[5672.60s -> 5672.92s]  Don't worry.
[5673.56s -> 5680.87s]  I have some raw meat.
[5680.87s -> 5681.43s]  I need to cook it.
[5682.68s -> 5683.56s]  Is there a fire right here?
[5684.20s -> 5688.39s]  Oh, shit.
[5688.95s -> 5693.35s]  How can people have highlighted purple chats?
[5694.25s -> 5696.41s]  Well, that's because they are using channel points.
[5697.05s -> 5702.42s]  A revitalizing potion to reduce.
[5709.56s -> 5715.02s]  Does that work?
[5715.58s -> 5717.90s]  Would this technically turn me away from a skeleton?
[5723.86s -> 5724.82s]  Okay, that's not working.
[5727.94s -> 5730.18s]  All right, I just want to make a couple of choices.
[5730.18s -> 5731.30s]  I'll make three choice steaks.
[5731.86s -> 5733.22s]  I don't have any wood.
[5733.22s -> 5734.18s]  God damn it.
[5734.18s -> 5737.43s]  I need I need wood.
[5737.43s -> 5743.77s]  Oh, this guy has his hair.
[5744.33s -> 5746.95s]  I need wood.
[5750.07s -> 5750.87s]  Where do I get wood?
[5756.06s -> 5756.62s]  All right, stop.
[5757.18s -> 5765.82s]  I need better planning.
[5765.82s -> 5767.96s]  This is to go to the cemetery.
[5767.96s -> 5769.72s]  I need where did I get the wood last time?
[5769.72s -> 5770.60s]  Just breaking boxes.
[5782.12s -> 5784.04s]  All right, I'm going to teleport over there again.
[5785.00s -> 5787.51s]  I still have the shovel.
[5787.51s -> 5788.23s]  I have a torch too.
[5788.23s -> 5789.03s]  Wait, will this work?
[5789.75s -> 5791.08s]  Hold on.
[5791.08s -> 5791.64s]  Let me try something.
[5796.66s -> 5797.38s]  Will this stop this?
[5800.15s -> 5800.95s]  Oh, it does.
[5800.95s -> 5801.75s]  All right, all right, all right.
[5801.75s -> 5802.31s]  I got something.
[5804.04s -> 5804.76s]  Set on fire.
[5806.41s -> 5806.89s]  Oh, yeah.
[5810.09s -> 5811.77s]  I thought I could use a regular torch.
[5811.77s -> 5817.14s]  So where does this go?
[5821.88s -> 5822.20s]  Pack.
[5823.40s -> 5824.12s]  Fish bones.
[5824.84s -> 5825.48s]  Chicken form.
[5826.04s -> 5828.81s]  I can go to the pier.
[5832.02s -> 5839.43s]  Why is this different?
[5840.33s -> 5840.97s]  Music change.
[5841.61s -> 5843.13s]  Pick lock recipe.
[5843.13s -> 5843.69s]  Get away from me.
[5844.57s -> 5844.97s]  Get away.
[5844.97s -> 5845.37s]  Get away.
[5847.69s -> 5848.25s]  Leave me alone.
[5848.25s -> 5848.81s]  Don't take anything.
[5850.20s -> 5850.84s]  Get out of here.
[5853.30s -> 5854.34s]  Oh, I can open the chest now.
[5858.17s -> 5859.29s]  That chest that needs a lockpick.
[5859.29s -> 5859.77s]  I can open it.
[5863.29s -> 5863.69s]  Coins.
[5874.33s -> 5875.37s]  We're purple pals.
[5875.93s -> 5883.72s]  All right, I don't want to get killed.
[5883.72s -> 5887.08s]  The worms.
[5887.08s -> 5890.97s]  Okay.
[5894.10s -> 5894.98s]  Ooh, what's over there?
[5895.70s -> 5899.54s]  I think I have to rebuild the bridge probably.
[5901.14s -> 5904.26s]  Looks like the Wild West.
[5904.90s -> 5906.34s]  Press this phone.
[5906.34s -> 5909.34s]  I don't want to kill this, but is it hostile?
[5909.98s -> 5910.30s]  It's not.
[5911.10s -> 5915.29s]  I do want the fish bones, but I don't want to kill it.
[5917.96s -> 5918.68s]  Where's my shovel?
[5924.92s -> 5927.78s]  We got what was that?
[5930.33s -> 5931.05s]  Restlessness?
[5932.81s -> 5935.45s]  Transforms the target into a restless version of himself.
[5938.90s -> 5942.26s]  Can I turn this into a chicken with this?
[5943.14s -> 5943.86s]  Is that how that works?
[5944.50s -> 5950.41s]  Like, if I threw that at the big scary guy,
[5950.41s -> 5951.45s]  would it turn into a chicken?
[5952.17s -> 5953.90s]  I'm going to try it.
[5962.10s -> 5962.58s]  Oh, shit.
[5962.58s -> 5962.98s]  Who's this?
[5966.70s -> 5967.50s]  I need wood.
[5968.54s -> 5969.50s]  I need wood.
[5969.50s -> 5969.98s]  So bad.
[5970.62s -> 5975.03s]  Put this away.
[5975.99s -> 5978.15s]  I'm going to put a lot of these potions away
[5978.15s -> 5979.19s]  because I really don't know what to do with them.
[5979.83s -> 5983.22s]  Put the heavy stuff away.
[5985.27s -> 5985.91s]  Oh, pick lock.
[5985.91s -> 5986.15s]  Yep.
[5986.87s -> 5989.64s]  I'll keep the damage.
[5990.36s -> 5993.59s]  I'll keep the spores.
[5993.59s -> 5994.15s]  Is there a bench?
[5994.15s -> 5994.87s]  You got a bench in here?
[5995.67s -> 5998.82s]  It's been a long time since I last seen one of your kind here at me docks.
[5999.54s -> 6000.66s]  I'd be the harbormaster,
[6000.66s -> 6001.70s]  welcomer of lost souls,
[6001.70s -> 6002.82s]  receiver of others' gold,
[6002.82s -> 6005.86s]  and ye came seeking respite from the Vanlands, eh?
[6006.90s -> 6008.58s]  What says he, warden?
[6008.58s -> 6010.90s]  Can you bargain for a few companion souls?
[6010.90s -> 6017.11s]  The pier is a grim place where you can find souls bound to a nameless ship.
[6017.83s -> 6021.35s]  The only way to set them free is to bargain with the harbormaster using gold coins.
[6021.99s -> 6026.18s]  They will become followers.
[6027.82s -> 6030.39s]  So no ship, no business.
[6030.39s -> 6031.03s]  Come back later.
[6031.75s -> 6034.36s]  Is it one dollar right here?
[6035.00s -> 6039.48s]  How much money do I have?
[6039.48s -> 6040.60s]  I have 81 bucks.
[6045.77s -> 6047.29s]  Oh, it's counting it.
[6047.29s -> 6047.85s]  I get it.
[6047.85s -> 6049.45s]  When that fills up, it'll be here.
[6050.17s -> 6053.98s]  Okay.
[6053.98s -> 6055.58s]  Well, I know how to do a lockpick now.
[6057.08s -> 6057.80s]  Hi, Andrew.
[6061.62s -> 6062.98s]  You have a little chicken.
[6064.02s -> 6065.38s]  That's such a funny companion.
[6068.58s -> 6070.66s]  Your two companions are like a baby chicken.
[6071.74s -> 6072.38s]  I want that.
[6076.52s -> 6080.12s]  He takes one glance over and sees that we're still doing the same shit.
[6080.12s -> 6080.60s]  Oh, yeah.
[6081.91s -> 6085.99s]  I take a quick look over and I see the redeeming winks.
[6087.24s -> 6089.00s]  That hasn't been a thing in like three years.
[6089.56s -> 6094.44s]  Okay, so that opens the pier.
[6102.26s -> 6103.06s]  I need...
[6103.06s -> 6103.94s]  Where do I get wood?
[6104.66s -> 6105.30s]  Reliably.
[6114.95s -> 6115.67s]  Okay.
[6115.67s -> 6116.63s]  I need wood.
[6116.63s -> 6117.91s]  Otherwise, I can't feed the dog.
[6119.54s -> 6120.42s]  I have no weapons.
[6121.62s -> 6122.26s]  I'm fucked.
[6124.22s -> 6124.78s]  I have this.
[6124.78s -> 6125.18s]  This is it.
[6125.18s -> 6125.74s]  That's all I have.
[6136.14s -> 6137.02s]  In barrels, maybe?
[6137.58s -> 6141.06s]  Where was I getting wood before?
[6141.54s -> 6148.92s]  These mushrooms?
[6148.92s -> 6152.97s]  Ooh, cut mushroom.
[6155.32s -> 6155.80s]  Oh, fuck.
[6155.80s -> 6156.36s]  94%.
[6156.36s -> 6157.16s]  Get out.
[6157.16s -> 6159.24s]  I got more...
[6160.12s -> 6161.90s]  Get me out.
[6161.90s -> 6165.75s]  We got a double wink?
[6165.75s -> 6173.32s]  Oh, there's a new one.
[6176.23s -> 6180.74s]  Damage potions, rejuvenation potions, and aging potions.
[6180.74s -> 6183.42s]  I think I have a couple of these, don't I?
[6183.42s -> 6187.38s]  Okay.
[6187.38s -> 6189.59s]  I already have these in my inventory.
[6189.59s -> 6196.34s]  Where's my money?
[6196.34s -> 6199.61s]  Where's my money?
[6199.61s -> 6201.26s]  Oh, it just goes right in your inventory.
[6201.26s -> 6204.25s]  Okay.
[6204.25s -> 6206.62s]  Oh, you ordered that.
[6206.62s -> 6208.14s]  R1, R1, R1, R1.
[6215.64s -> 6218.14s]  This thing is still here.
[6218.14s -> 6228.38s]  Can I pick this up?
[6228.38s -> 6229.58s]  Oh, your lockpick recipe.
[6229.58s -> 6234.84s]  Thank you.
[6234.84s -> 6235.56s]  More research.
[6236.20s -> 6237.62s]  Okay.
[6237.62s -> 6247.67s]  I need logs, bones, spores, sulfur.
[6249.34s -> 6249.58s]  Okay.
[6249.58s -> 6250.62s]  I can make some more potions.
[6251.26s -> 6256.33s]  Vitality.
[6256.33s -> 6257.61s]  I need aloe.
[6257.61s -> 6263.11s]  I don't need more worms, do I?
[6263.11s -> 6263.43s]  No.
[6263.43s -> 6264.15s]  I need aloe.
[6264.87s -> 6267.83s]  Do remove plus restless.
[6269.51s -> 6271.27s]  Ah, will that actually work?
[6271.91s -> 6277.40s]  Remove...
[6277.40s -> 6278.04s]  I don't have...
[6278.04s -> 6279.56s]  Wait, will that actually work?
[6280.12s -> 6287.38s]  Do you hide money in your walls?
[6288.26s -> 6288.50s]  No.
[6290.49s -> 6291.05s]  Remove...
[6291.69s -> 6294.14s]  What was restless?
[6295.90s -> 6296.38s]  Charcoal?
[6298.98s -> 6299.94s]  I don't have any charcoal.
[6300.58s -> 6303.10s]  I need to...
[6303.10s -> 6304.54s]  I need to cut a tree down, but I need...
[6304.54s -> 6305.90s]  I don't have an axe.
[6305.90s -> 6310.50s]  I can make these.
[6317.40s -> 6317.88s]  Add...
[6317.88s -> 6318.12s]  Yeah.
[6318.12s -> 6319.16s]  Give me some healing potions.
[6320.04s -> 6323.61s]  All right.
[6323.61s -> 6325.45s]  That's literally 10 healing potions.
[6325.45s -> 6326.73s]  I'm unstoppable.
[6326.73s -> 6331.75s]  Okay.
[6331.75s -> 6332.63s]  Restlessness.
[6332.63s -> 6334.23s]  Change restlessness.
[6334.23s -> 6335.59s]  I need to remove restlessness.
[6336.81s -> 6337.45s]  Don't...
[6337.45s -> 6337.77s]  No.
[6337.77s -> 6338.65s]  Stop drinking it.
[6338.65s -> 6339.53s]  Don't do that again.
[6340.25s -> 6341.64s]  All right.
[6341.64s -> 6342.44s]  I'm good.
[6342.44s -> 6351.10s]  I need...
[6351.66s -> 6353.02s]  Portable lab is just wasting much.
[6353.02s -> 6353.26s]  Okay.
[6353.26s -> 6353.66s]  Let's go.
[6354.38s -> 6357.32s]  All right.
[6358.06s -> 6358.94s]  I'm going up there.
[6358.94s -> 6359.90s]  I don't care if I get killed.
[6365.69s -> 6366.97s]  I have some decent money too.
[6366.97s -> 6368.17s]  What can I do with it?
[6368.17s -> 6374.17s]  Is this like Terraria?
[6377.35s -> 6378.07s]  Maybe a little.
[6378.71s -> 6380.30s]  I can make a room.
[6380.30s -> 6380.70s]  I just need...
[6381.78s -> 6383.54s]  I'm just going on a wood collection.
[6383.54s -> 6385.06s]  I don't care if I have to punch a tree.
[6385.06s -> 6385.46s]  I don't care.
[6386.10s -> 6388.33s]  I'm going to go punch a tree
[6388.33s -> 6389.29s]  until I get enough berries.
[6389.85s -> 6393.43s]  My character sucks.
[6393.43s -> 6393.75s]  I did it.
[6393.75s -> 6394.63s]  I did it to myself.
[6395.19s -> 6397.40s]  All right.
[6397.40s -> 6398.92s]  You're hungry, but you eat raw meat, right?
[6399.48s -> 6406.15s]  Want some more?
[6412.22s -> 6412.86s]  Right, dear.
[6413.50s -> 6415.66s]  Ooh.
[6416.22s -> 6418.44s]  Okay.
[6419.38s -> 6420.66s]  This thing's actually pretty powerful.
[6420.66s -> 6421.78s]  I don't want this to die.
[6421.78s -> 6422.70s]  Let's play.
[6426.46s -> 6428.54s]  I really don't want this thing to die,
[6429.54s -> 6430.42s]  but I need its help.
[6430.42s -> 6431.06s]  So we're going to go.
[6431.62s -> 6438.94s]  I need wood.
[6438.94s -> 6447.74s]  Fucking...
[6447.74s -> 6447.98s]  No.
[6447.98s -> 6448.38s]  All right.
[6448.38s -> 6452.86s]  Wood.
[6452.86s -> 6454.70s]  I need this fucking tree to go down.
[6454.70s -> 6454.94s]  All right.
[6454.94s -> 6459.72s]  Can I blow it up or something?
[6459.72s -> 6460.44s]  Shells, right?
[6462.20s -> 6463.00s]  Okay.
[6463.00s -> 6463.96s]  Be careful.
[6463.96s -> 6467.18s]  Don't get killed, dear.
[6467.18s -> 6469.69s]  I need wood.
[6469.69s -> 6470.49s]  It's going to die.
[6470.49s -> 6471.37s]  It's not going to die.
[6471.37s -> 6472.41s]  I can teleport.
[6472.41s -> 6481.80s]  Just don't aggro the huge thing.
[6490.54s -> 6491.90s]  I need logs so bad.
[6491.90s -> 6492.46s]  All right.
[6492.46s -> 6493.26s]  Wait here.
[6493.26s -> 6494.14s]  Don't go anywhere.
[6505.50s -> 6506.30s]  Am I opening this?
[6506.86s -> 6507.82s]  Did it open?
[6507.82s -> 6511.70s]  Okay.
[6511.70s -> 6514.70s]  I guess that's a lot.
[6515.34s -> 6516.54s]  I got a sword recipe now.
[6517.10s -> 6518.81s]  Okay.
[6518.81s -> 6521.38s]  Now we just need logs.
[6521.38s -> 6525.34s]  Now come with me.
[6527.93s -> 6528.73s]  Follow me.
[6528.73s -> 6534.39s]  Help me find logs.
[6534.39s -> 6534.63s]  All right.
[6534.63s -> 6535.83s]  I'm just killing that thing, by the way.
[6535.83s -> 6536.39s]  I'm making a sword.
[6536.39s -> 6537.19s]  I'm going to kill it.
[6537.19s -> 6544.52s]  A ship with fresh shells.
[6544.52s -> 6544.76s]  Okay.
[6548.18s -> 6548.58s]  Watch out.
[6548.58s -> 6549.30s]  Don't let it blow up on you.
[6549.30s -> 6550.26s]  Watch out.
[6550.26s -> 6552.22s]  We got to kill this thing.
[6552.22s -> 6558.33s]  All right.
[6558.33s -> 6561.10s]  Good work.
[6561.10s -> 6562.38s]  Dog's actually really good.
[6562.38s -> 6563.02s]  Very powerful.
[6563.82s -> 6564.78s]  Highly recommend.
[6564.78s -> 6570.14s]  52%.
[6570.14s -> 6570.46s]  All right.
[6570.46s -> 6572.54s]  I need logs.
[6572.54s -> 6581.50s]  Got to get it.
[6581.50s -> 6585.72s]  Okay.
[6585.72s -> 6591.37s]  Where do I find logs without an axe?
[6591.37s -> 6592.49s]  Don't just kill random...
[6592.49s -> 6592.73s]  All right.
[6592.73s -> 6593.13s]  No, no, no.
[6593.13s -> 6594.01s]  We're getting close.
[6594.89s -> 6595.13s]  Wait.
[6595.13s -> 6595.45s]  No, no.
[6595.45s -> 6596.17s]  Don't eat these.
[6596.73s -> 6598.01s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[6598.01s -> 6598.33s]  You don't...
[6598.33s -> 6598.97s]  That's not...
[6598.97s -> 6599.45s]  Don't do that.
[6600.58s -> 6601.54s]  They're so cute.
[6606.95s -> 6607.35s]  All right.
[6607.35s -> 6610.98s]  You have moonstone and a wild chicken.
[6610.98s -> 6614.36s]  I got a moonstone.
[6614.36s -> 6614.60s]  Okay.
[6623.02s -> 6623.50s]  Percy?
[6624.06s -> 6632.54s]  Is that bad?
[6632.54s -> 6633.26s]  Oops.
[6633.26s -> 6635.75s]  Oh, I got a ghoul.
[6635.75s -> 6636.55s]  Wait, what's that?
[6636.55s -> 6645.59s]  Should I not have done that?
[6645.59s -> 6647.11s]  Oops.
[6647.11s -> 6648.55s]  Well, they were like corrupted.
[6648.55s -> 6650.23s]  They were like a corrupted skeleton person.
[6650.23s -> 6653.26s]  I had to fucking kill them.
[6653.26s -> 6653.90s]  Okay.
[6653.90s -> 6656.66s]  How are you doing on health?
[6656.66s -> 6660.86s]  Are you okay?
[6660.86s -> 6661.66s]  You're good, right?
[6661.66s -> 6666.06s]  All right.
[6666.06s -> 6667.26s]  Seriously, I need logs.
[6667.74s -> 6671.64s]  How was I getting them before?
[6671.64s -> 6675.61s]  I don't remember.
[6675.61s -> 6676.33s]  Save that guy.
[6676.33s -> 6676.97s]  He's already dead.
[6676.97s -> 6680.28s]  All right.
[6680.28s -> 6681.24s]  There's a torch.
[6681.24s -> 6687.62s]  This is that multiplayer?
[6687.62s -> 6688.58s]  I don't think so.
[6688.58s -> 6693.43s]  Where can I get some logs to make some stuff?
[6695.94s -> 6698.10s]  I think I just sapped this whole place of logs.
[6698.66s -> 6701.19s]  Okay.
[6701.19s -> 6702.47s]  I don't want to fuck with this thing.
[6702.47s -> 6708.55s]  What's fighting?
[6708.55s -> 6709.70s]  Look, they're in here.
[6709.70s -> 6710.50s]  I just can't get them.
[6715.78s -> 6717.22s]  No, don't heal them, you idiot.
[6717.22s -> 6718.02s]  What are you doing?
[6718.02s -> 6718.58s]  Put that away.
[6723.88s -> 6724.52s]  The dog.
[6725.91s -> 6726.15s]  No.
[6727.27s -> 6728.79s]  Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[6728.79s -> 6729.75s]  Come here, come here.
[6729.75s -> 6730.23s]  Come here.
[6730.23s -> 6730.95s]  Take this.
[6730.95s -> 6735.19s]  We're good.
[6735.64s -> 6737.00s]  That was actually scary.
[6737.00s -> 6740.38s]  Okay.
[6742.58s -> 6743.46s]  What's wrong with them?
[6743.46s -> 6747.91s]  What's wrong with them?
[6747.91s -> 6753.06s]  Is he okay?
[6753.06s -> 6753.86s]  Don't get involved.
[6754.42s -> 6755.16s]  Don't get involved.
[6755.16s -> 6755.72s]  Don't get involved.
[6756.28s -> 6757.40s]  Just clean up.
[6757.40s -> 6760.44s]  Okay.
[6760.44s -> 6762.28s]  I've discovered the little chicks.
[6762.28s -> 6770.47s]  Pick up the logs that you dropped.
[6770.47s -> 6772.92s]  Where did I drop them?
[6772.92s -> 6776.38s]  There's so much bullshit over here.
[6776.38s -> 6781.14s]  Up there, right?
[6781.14s -> 6781.78s]  By the sulfur.
[6786.94s -> 6790.54s]  You could have accepted Assassin's Creed DLC sponsorship.
[6793.14s -> 6793.94s]  Why would I do that?
[6796.95s -> 6798.63s]  Stop healing them, you dummy.
[6799.35s -> 6806.18s]  But instead you took a cool indie sponsor.
[6806.18s -> 6806.82s]  Yeah.
[6806.82s -> 6807.62s]  This game is fun.
[6811.02s -> 6812.86s]  I actually think the game is pretty good.
[6812.86s -> 6814.55s]  It's definitely worth playing.
[6817.34s -> 6817.58s]  All right.
[6817.58s -> 6818.14s]  Give me all this.
[6818.70s -> 6828.57s]  Did I already go through 10 potions?
[6828.57s -> 6829.21s]  How did I do that?
[6832.52s -> 6833.00s]  Oh, wait.
[6833.00s -> 6833.56s]  I can...
[6833.56s -> 6834.20s]  Can I do this?
[6836.15s -> 6836.95s]  Wait a minute.
[6836.95s -> 6837.56s]  Okay.
[6837.56s -> 6837.88s]  Hold on.
[6839.85s -> 6843.45s]  If I give you a bunch of stuff, you can take it back to town.
[6843.45s -> 6844.79s]  Is it as it works?
[6846.50s -> 6847.46s]  Take like all this shit.
[6847.46s -> 6848.42s]  Take like ghoul skin.
[6848.42s -> 6849.06s]  Take the hair.
[6849.86s -> 6850.34s]  Take all this.
[6851.14s -> 6851.78s]  Boon Stone.
[6853.99s -> 6854.39s]  Pump.
[6854.39s -> 6854.55s]  Yeah.
[6854.55s -> 6855.75s]  Just take a bunch of stuff back to town.
[6856.31s -> 6862.70s]  Actually, we got to both go like right now.
[6862.70s -> 6866.65s]  We're good.
[6876.95s -> 6877.27s]  Okay.
[6878.76s -> 6879.32s]  Thank you.
[6879.32s -> 6880.52s]  Appreciate the help.
[6880.52s -> 6881.24s]  I'll take everything.
[6882.12s -> 6886.33s]  What's going on?
[6886.33s -> 6889.61s]  Why am I glowing?
[6890.17s -> 6895.51s]  All right.
[6895.51s -> 6896.71s]  We got out in time.
[6896.71s -> 6897.40s]  Okay.
[6897.40s -> 6898.92s]  Ghoul skin, hair.
[6898.92s -> 6900.20s]  I need 15 hairs.
[6902.28s -> 6902.60s]  Shell.
[6903.24s -> 6904.57s]  Okay.
[6904.57s -> 6905.69s]  Shell is five.
[6910.68s -> 6912.95s]  It's five instead of 10.
[6912.95s -> 6913.27s]  Cool.
[6918.23s -> 6923.26s]  So add five vitality is a potion.
[6923.26s -> 6925.27s]  It's a regular healing potion.
[6925.27s -> 6926.07s]  All right.
[6926.07s -> 6933.48s]  The person who said he's acting like he does when he plays multiplayer games is right.
[6934.04s -> 6939.74s]  You want to do a TikTok dance?
[6939.74s -> 6940.46s]  Will that make you happy?
[6940.46s -> 6942.30s]  You want to go do a TikTok dance?
[6942.78s -> 6946.98s]  You want to go put like something like you want to put something in my eyes?
[6951.66s -> 6952.62s]  Should I do a TikTok dance?
[6952.62s -> 6953.26s]  Will that make you happy?
[6957.11s -> 6957.51s]  There you go.
[6958.31s -> 6959.85s]  Slow that down.
[6961.93s -> 6963.77s]  Slow that down to like 0.2.
[6964.65s -> 6970.79s]  All right.
[6970.79s -> 6974.12s]  How are you doing on food?
[6974.12s -> 6975.00s]  Are you hungry?
[6975.00s -> 6979.51s]  I think you're hungry.
[6980.15s -> 6986.30s]  Yeah.
[6986.30s -> 6991.21s]  We do eat anything besides just raw meat because that's kind of hard to get.
[6991.21s -> 6993.98s]  Let's see.
[6993.98s -> 6994.70s]  What else do you like?
[6997.46s -> 6998.50s]  Baked meat pie.
[6999.30s -> 7001.22s]  But I only have one baked meat pie.
[7002.81s -> 7003.13s]  All right.
[7003.13s -> 7004.09s]  You can have it.
[7004.09s -> 7006.33s]  Oh, you don't like it.
[7006.33s -> 7011.18s]  Someone slow it down.
[7013.43s -> 7014.47s]  Well, just give me the clip.
[7014.47s -> 7015.75s]  I'll slow it down for you.
[7015.75s -> 7021.34s]  Please do the router turn off joke right now.
[7021.34s -> 7022.50s]  Let me sit.
[7022.50s -> 7024.50s]  Let's watch it right now.
[7030.28s -> 7031.40s]  Will that make you happy?
[7031.40s -> 7034.57s]  You want to go put like something like you want to put something in my eyes?
[7043.62s -> 7047.45s]  Let's take a look.
[7051.90s -> 7056.09s]  Let's see if it looks any good.
[7056.09s -> 7056.57s]  Slow it down.
[7057.53s -> 7058.17s]  Do a TikTok dance.
[7058.17s -> 7058.89s]  Will that make you happy?
[7058.89s -> 7060.65s]  You want to go for a TikTok dance?
[7062.87s -> 7065.35s]  You want to go put like something like you want to put something in my
[7070.49s -> 7071.37s]  Okay, let's see.
[7072.66s -> 7075.14s]  I did it fast so it could be slowed down and enjoyed.
[7075.14s -> 7081.91s]  But that was just a sped up one.
[7081.91s -> 7082.71s]  This is what it actually is.
[7090.38s -> 7096.04s]  And that made me to be a little slower.
[7107.61s -> 7108.89s]  That's fucking terrifying.
[7111.11s -> 7112.47s]  That's fucking scary.
[7114.33s -> 7115.61s]  That's really scary.
[7117.00s -> 7117.96s]  What about faster?
[7134.09s -> 7136.01s]  Why do I have such dead eyes?
[7136.01s -> 7138.58s]  Look at how dead my eyes are.
[7147.98s -> 7149.74s]  That's fucking weird.
[7149.74s -> 7155.18s]  I look, my eyes look dead.
[7157.69s -> 7160.84s]  Right?
[7160.84s -> 7164.18s]  I was like, this is weird.
[7164.18s -> 7164.90s]  Psycho eyes.
[7172.04s -> 7172.78s]  Okay.
[7178.86s -> 7179.74s]  How do I make the sword?
[7180.38s -> 7182.86s]  Sword is going to change the whole game here.
[7183.58s -> 7189.22s]  I need it.
[7189.22s -> 7189.46s]  What do I?
[7189.46s -> 7190.58s]  I need a research table.
[7190.58s -> 7190.98s]  Let's go.
[7191.94s -> 7192.44s]  Okay.
[7192.44s -> 7193.80s]  I need to remove.
[7193.80s -> 7195.96s]  I need to remove change, right?
[7197.77s -> 7199.37s]  Remove change.
[7199.37s -> 7200.25s]  Can I actually do that?
[7202.01s -> 7203.61s]  Remove change.
[7205.64s -> 7206.12s]  Fuck you.
[7207.94s -> 7208.44s]  What?
[7211.64s -> 7212.68s]  Remove restless.
[7213.72s -> 7220.15s]  Agro the fawn near a tree.
[7220.15s -> 7221.03s]  It'll knock one over.
[7221.03s -> 7221.53s]  Really?
[7222.07s -> 7226.94s]  Good to know.
[7226.94s -> 7229.06s]  How am I doing on a weight?
[7229.06s -> 7229.30s]  Okay.
[7229.30s -> 7229.70s]  I'm fine.
[7232.44s -> 7232.92s]  Hey, hi.
[7233.48s -> 7235.24s]  Why is everybody dead?
[7235.88s -> 7239.00s]  Like, why is everybody dead?
[7240.44s -> 7241.24s]  I'm dead too.
[7241.24s -> 7241.80s]  We're all dead.
[7242.36s -> 7243.93s]  Okay.
[7243.93s -> 7245.69s]  A sword is three scrap and one wood.
[7245.69s -> 7246.81s]  And I really desperately need it.
[7246.81s -> 7248.01s]  I need scrap and I need wood.
[7248.57s -> 7248.81s]  Bad.
[7248.81s -> 7249.69s]  Like, very badly.
[7250.25s -> 7251.85s]  And I don't want to put the dog in danger.
[7252.73s -> 7253.93s]  So I'm going to tell the dog to go home.
[7254.57s -> 7255.50s]  You just go.
[7257.16s -> 7259.16s]  Just like, go wander around and go have fun.
[7259.88s -> 7262.06s]  I'll come back and see you in a minute.
[7262.62s -> 7265.03s]  Be careful though.
[7265.03s -> 7265.83s]  Don't get in any trouble.
[7266.39s -> 7272.32s]  Okay.
[7273.90s -> 7274.40s]  Wood.
[7274.86s -> 7276.98s]  Was that fawn?
[7277.54s -> 7282.63s]  What's the net?
[7282.63s -> 7283.99s]  What do you have for a talking point?
[7285.30s -> 7286.34s]  Um, I don't know.
[7287.14s -> 7293.82s]  I'll take the torch.
[7294.46s -> 7297.21s]  I wish I could just break this down into wood.
[7297.77s -> 7302.28s]  Okay.
[7302.74s -> 7305.54s]  There's a bunch of bullshit up here.
[7305.54s -> 7306.26s]  I can clear it though.
[7309.14s -> 7309.46s]  All right.
[7309.46s -> 7309.96s]  Wood.
[7310.26s -> 7313.30s]  I mean, I have two moonstones, right?
[7313.30s -> 7315.14s]  Do I think I can open that chest for free?
[7315.78s -> 7318.70s]  Isn't there a chest over here?
[7319.26s -> 7324.02s]  I have another moonstone at the back of the house.
[7324.66s -> 7329.00s]  I need three.
[7329.98s -> 7331.10s]  Get some wood, please.
[7331.10s -> 7331.66s]  I'm trying.
[7332.46s -> 7338.01s]  Can I just like go buy somebody and have...
[7338.09s -> 7340.33s]  Go buy a follower and have them go chop wood for me?
[7341.13s -> 7343.54s]  Will they be able to make their own stuff?
[7343.54s -> 7349.75s]  I have 41.
[7349.75s -> 7350.25s]  I'm fine.
[7353.64s -> 7354.04s]  Maybe?
[7354.04s -> 7354.68s]  That's possible.
[7355.24s -> 7356.31s]  I'll give it a try.
[7358.90s -> 7359.40s]  Hide.
[7363.18s -> 7365.18s]  Really?
[7365.18s -> 7366.86s]  Stealth mode allows you to pickpocket.
[7367.42s -> 7372.74s]  But use this cautiously as it'll draw attention to you and blow your cover.
[7372.74s -> 7373.94s]  Oh, I'm just like in a bush.
[7373.94s -> 7374.66s]  That's kind of funny.
[7375.22s -> 7378.23s]  Wait, can I pickpocket this person?
[7380.57s -> 7381.37s]  Bailey.
[7381.37s -> 7387.62s]  How do I do it?
[7387.62s -> 7390.95s]  This person is st...
[7390.95s -> 7391.35s]  What are the...
[7391.35s -> 7392.15s]  Will they have glass?
[7392.15s -> 7392.95s]  How do I pickpocket?
[7395.83s -> 7396.33s]  Steel.
[7396.63s -> 7400.26s]  Oh, I took the glass out of your hand.
[7400.82s -> 7403.10s]  And all the pumpkins you have.
[7403.10s -> 7404.14s]  And a bunch of meat that you had.
[7405.29s -> 7405.79s]  Okay.
[7406.33s -> 7416.17s]  Okay.
[7416.17s -> 7420.79s]  All right.
[7420.79s -> 7421.59s]  Try a follower?
[7423.86s -> 7424.50s]  What am I doing?
[7425.22s -> 7425.78s]  Bro, what?
[7425.78s -> 7426.28s]  What?
[7428.14s -> 7429.02s]  They're corrupted.
[7429.02s -> 7430.06s]  They're like zombies.
[7430.06s -> 7431.02s]  I have to get rid of them.
[7431.02s -> 7440.84s]  All right.
[7440.84s -> 7442.28s]  Let me try that thing with that person over at the fawn.
[7446.38s -> 7448.94s]  What happened to the big boss thing that was over here?
[7448.94s -> 7449.74s]  It's not here anymore.
[7450.30s -> 7451.75s]  I haven't seen it.
[7452.31s -> 7460.42s]  It's up in the northwest.
[7460.98s -> 7461.46s]  All right.
[7461.46s -> 7462.34s]  I want to see if I can get the...
[7462.34s -> 7463.46s]  The person said get a fawn.
[7464.26s -> 7467.42s]  If I get a fawn, then I can have them knock a tree over, right?
[7468.14s -> 7470.47s]  Claw amulet.
[7472.17s -> 7472.89s]  Cool.
[7472.89s -> 7479.27s]  Oh, what's that?
[7479.27s -> 7480.40s]  That's new.
[7481.02s -> 7489.45s]  Raw meat.
[7489.45s -> 7489.77s]  Good.
[7489.77s -> 7490.27s]  It's ore.
[7490.97s -> 7495.29s]  I'm fine.
[7495.29s -> 7496.09s]  I need that fawn.
[7496.73s -> 7498.74s]  Don't worry, guys.
[7498.74s -> 7500.58s]  He's doing the softlock route on purpose.
[7504.04s -> 7505.56s]  This is not the softlock route.
[7505.56s -> 7506.52s]  Why does this run heavenly?
[7507.24s -> 7507.98s]  All right.
[7507.98s -> 7509.66s]  Come with me and I want you to break some stuff for me.
[7510.22s -> 7513.45s]  Can I like talk to this guy?
[7514.17s -> 7518.23s]  Okay.
[7518.23s -> 7521.51s]  So you're saying walk the fawn over to a tree and he will destroy it.
[7522.15s -> 7525.03s]  I didn't get softlocked.
[7525.03s -> 7525.43s]  I'm fine.
[7525.99s -> 7527.64s]  All right.
[7527.64s -> 7528.20s]  Come down here.
[7528.92s -> 7531.42s]  All right.
[7531.42s -> 7532.38s]  Come break this.
[7532.38s -> 7533.42s]  Just so I don't get softlocked.
[7533.90s -> 7539.43s]  It's the moonstone effect.
[7540.55s -> 7540.79s]  All right.
[7540.79s -> 7541.11s]  Come on.
[7541.11s -> 7541.35s]  Move.
[7541.99s -> 7543.82s]  I have to punch him.
[7549.37s -> 7551.05s]  That chicken just ran into the pole and died.
[7551.93s -> 7553.64s]  All right.
[7553.64s -> 7554.68s]  Knock this stuff down.
[7561.08s -> 7561.64s]  Did it work?
[7565.98s -> 7566.46s]  It worked.
[7566.46s -> 7566.86s]  Holy shit.
[7566.86s -> 7567.42s]  They were right.
[7568.78s -> 7569.50s]  Oh, my God.
[7569.50s -> 7570.62s]  You actually weren't kidding.
[7571.26s -> 7573.78s]  All right.
[7573.78s -> 7574.34s]  Get this one, too.
[7574.90s -> 7576.42s]  I need like 10 at least.
[7581.94s -> 7583.06s]  Don't kill your own stuff.
[7583.78s -> 7587.42s]  Do the big AOE.
[7588.30s -> 7591.08s]  Break it.
[7591.72s -> 7593.94s]  All right.
[7593.94s -> 7594.82s]  That's like two more.
[7595.62s -> 7596.84s]  Get away from me.
[7596.84s -> 7599.18s]  Okay.
[7599.18s -> 7600.46s]  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[7600.46s -> 7601.10s]  This one over here.
[7601.66s -> 7603.34s]  It's 80 percent.
[7603.34s -> 7603.58s]  I'm good.
[7604.22s -> 7610.39s]  I bet you'd get something crazy if you kill this thing.
[7610.95s -> 7613.94s]  Just come take all the trees down
[7614.50s -> 7616.81s]  so I can come here with a sword and an axe.
[7616.81s -> 7620.33s]  You still chasing me?
[7620.97s -> 7625.34s]  Killed the chicken, too.
[7625.34s -> 7627.42s]  No, that would be poisoned.
[7630.89s -> 7631.13s]  All right.
[7631.13s -> 7632.57s]  Just knock these down and I'm out of here.
[7633.13s -> 7635.10s]  I'll leave after you do this.
[7635.10s -> 7635.58s]  I promise.
[7636.14s -> 7640.73s]  I'm not going to kill the chicken for no reason.
[7641.45s -> 7642.95s]  All right.
[7642.95s -> 7643.43s]  This one, too.
[7644.15s -> 7645.62s]  Thank you.
[7649.08s -> 7650.68s]  Just kicked me in the fucking face.
[7651.88s -> 7653.32s]  Don't die to this.
[7653.32s -> 7653.80s]  Come on.
[7654.60s -> 7658.42s]  Do I have any healing potions left?
[7662.22s -> 7662.86s]  Why is he so?
[7662.86s -> 7663.82s]  Why are you so much faster now?
[7664.76s -> 7666.76s]  This guy is a thousand miles per hour now.
[7666.76s -> 7667.64s]  Just kick this, please.
[7671.77s -> 7672.01s]  All right.
[7672.01s -> 7672.41s]  Fuck off.
[7672.41s -> 7672.81s]  Goodbye.
[7677.00s -> 7679.94s]  Goodbye.
[7679.94s -> 7687.37s]  Now I can make some stuff.
[7687.37s -> 7687.69s]  All right.
[7687.69s -> 7691.85s]  I need damage plus healing plus rejuvenation, aging, healing.
[7691.85s -> 7692.41s]  I can do that.
[7693.13s -> 7694.25s]  I can do this one.
[7695.75s -> 7695.99s]  Yep.
[7696.55s -> 7697.27s]  Okay.
[7697.27s -> 7697.83s]  Take the money.
[7697.83s -> 7698.15s]  Thank you.
[7701.85s -> 7702.17s]  Okay.
[7703.22s -> 7703.54s]  All right.
[7704.18s -> 7713.21s]  How much more do I need?
[7713.21s -> 7713.85s]  I got this new thing.
[7714.65s -> 7715.13s]  Thorner.
[7716.01s -> 7720.62s]  It's fun just to go pick up the stuff and then put it in here.
[7723.66s -> 7723.90s]  Okay.
[7725.34s -> 7725.98s]  I need.
[7728.82s -> 7730.90s]  So let's take this.
[7731.62s -> 7733.46s]  I will make charcoal, right?
[7733.46s -> 7733.86s]  Won't I?
[7734.42s -> 7740.28s]  I'm going to make some steak for my friend.
[7741.64s -> 7742.20s]  Yep.
[7742.20s -> 7743.40s]  Cooking gives you charcoal.
[7745.98s -> 7746.30s]  Okay.
[7746.86s -> 7751.13s]  Let me go feed my friend.
[7754.68s -> 7756.84s]  It's a calm game with an ice streamer.
[7759.32s -> 7761.83s]  Yeah, this is I can give you my thoughts.
[7762.39s -> 7769.74s]  It seems elaborate enough and it seems big enough.
[7770.46s -> 7774.79s]  I don't know how much bigger the world is, but I'm assuming there's probably more like
[7774.79s -> 7775.43s]  all the way up here.
[7775.99s -> 7780.22s]  It seems cute.
[7780.22s -> 7780.62s]  It's fun.
[7781.18s -> 7782.78s]  I think I actually think it's good.
[7786.22s -> 7789.02s]  I don't think I'm too pea brained to enjoy this either.
[7789.02s -> 7791.02s]  I think it's just enough for me to understand.
[7794.89s -> 7795.53s]  All right.
[7795.53s -> 7796.41s]  This might be stupid.
[7796.41s -> 7796.89s]  I'm going to do it.
[7815.77s -> 7816.33s]  Contain.
[7820.63s -> 7823.80s]  Oh, that's what I was supposed to do.
[7824.78s -> 7825.58s]  Oh my goodness.
[7825.58s -> 7826.14s]  It's a vessel.
[7829.05s -> 7830.81s]  I need a human follower to pick this up.
[7830.81s -> 7831.53s]  What?
[7831.53s -> 7831.77s]  How?
[7832.65s -> 7833.45s]  Okay.
[7833.45s -> 7833.77s]  All right.
[7833.77s -> 7834.17s]  Slow down.
[7834.81s -> 7835.37s]  I need to go.
[7835.93s -> 7836.65s]  Oh, shit.
[7836.65s -> 7836.97s]  All right.
[7837.69s -> 7840.54s]  That's what you have to do.
[7840.54s -> 7843.40s]  That's the money sink.
[7843.40s -> 7844.20s]  All right.
[7844.20s -> 7845.66s]  How much is it for?
[7846.70s -> 7847.58s]  That doesn't disappear, right?
[7848.39s -> 7854.26s]  Hope not.
[7854.26s -> 7855.06s]  How much does it cost?
[7858.25s -> 7858.73s]  I wonder.
[7859.45s -> 7861.86s]  I love I keep asking you guys as if you guys are going to know.
[7863.06s -> 7863.54s]  Maybe you do.
[7863.54s -> 7864.50s]  Maybe you guys have already played it.
[7865.46s -> 7872.62s]  So the boat, the boats here and I need a follower.
[7873.18s -> 7877.91s]  I need a follower to go pick that thing up.
[7878.47s -> 7881.24s]  Cooking recipe.
[7881.88s -> 7892.57s]  Guys, this is smoked fish pasty.
[7895.54s -> 7896.02s]  All right.
[7896.02s -> 7896.98s]  I'm just going to hang on here for a second.
[7898.47s -> 7899.43s]  Explore the map more.
[7900.63s -> 7903.67s]  I have to do this first part here.
[7903.67s -> 7907.67s]  I can't go up or I don't think I can go anywhere until I do that first little tutorial zone.
[7908.47s -> 7911.11s]  What's the downside to being restless?
[7911.91s -> 7913.75s]  You don't have stamina and you deal more damage.
[7914.39s -> 7916.54s]  Yeah, I actually don't know.
[7916.54s -> 7917.90s]  I think it's no stamina.
[7917.90s -> 7918.78s]  So no sprinting.
[7919.90s -> 7920.78s]  No hunger.
[7920.78s -> 7921.90s]  I'm sure I can look it up, right?
[7921.90s -> 7922.30s]  Let's see.
[7923.26s -> 7927.64s]  Human.
[7927.64s -> 7928.60s]  That's what that is, right?
[7934.89s -> 7936.81s]  Human with that immunity.
[7937.53s -> 7939.53s]  35 health, five attack.
[7940.33s -> 7941.53s]  No food and don't age.
[7945.45s -> 7948.49s]  Versus two attack, one attack.
[7948.49s -> 7949.29s]  What's the green mean?
[7951.62s -> 7953.43s]  All right, here we go.
[7954.07s -> 7954.87s]  I need a follower.
[7955.59s -> 7964.65s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[7967.03s -> 7969.27s]  Ratio plus L plus you're a skeleton.
[7970.90s -> 7973.30s]  No maidens plus no followers plus L plus ratio.
[7980.42s -> 7981.22s]  Oh my God.
[7981.22s -> 7982.02s]  Fucking pull in.
[7987.34s -> 7987.98s]  Where are you?
[7987.98s -> 7988.86s]  There we go.
[7988.86s -> 7989.74s]  All right.
[7989.74s -> 7990.24s]  Who's here?
[7991.10s -> 7998.07s]  Fish spawn.
[7998.07s -> 8000.94s]  Okay.
[8001.02s -> 8001.50s]  What else?
[8002.78s -> 8008.06s]  Well, there's a book.
[8008.06s -> 8013.69s]  Is anybody on the boat?
[8015.38s -> 8016.18s]  The boat's empty.
[8017.06s -> 8022.68s]  Are they on the side?
[8022.68s -> 8024.12s]  Wait, maybe I just talked to one.
[8025.08s -> 8026.95s]  Oh, the fog.
[8026.95s -> 8028.31s]  Make me peer so pretty.
[8028.31s -> 8030.63s]  You can hardly see the misery in them.
[8031.27s -> 8033.66s]  Oh, okay.
[8033.66s -> 8035.42s]  Oh, you guys have only eight bucks.
[8038.68s -> 8044.42s]  Oh, 12 health, 25 stamina.
[8044.42s -> 8046.42s]  You got a hair, a torch, and a pumpkin.
[8047.14s -> 8047.62s]  All right, dude.
[8047.62s -> 8048.18s]  I don't know about you.
[8048.98s -> 8051.72s]  Clement, three.
[8051.72s -> 8052.84s]  This is a kid.
[8052.84s -> 8054.44s]  This is like a fucking five-year-old.
[8060.82s -> 8062.02s]  Okay, Julie, 10.
[8062.98s -> 8064.26s]  You got metal scrap on you too.
[8064.82s -> 8066.17s]  I wish I had 84.
[8066.97s -> 8068.30s]  All right.
[8070.30s -> 8073.06s]  How many people can I hire?
[8073.06s -> 8077.35s]  Just take them all.
[8077.35s -> 8081.69s]  Okay, come with me.
[8083.19s -> 8085.11s]  All right, nobody walk off the edge, please.
[8086.46s -> 8088.70s]  Okay, I need somebody to pick up this thing over here.
[8092.34s -> 8093.62s]  You can go with a whole party?
[8093.62s -> 8094.58s]  That's actually kind of funny.
[8095.30s -> 8096.26s]  How many people can you have?
[8096.26s -> 8102.36s]  Okay, so we're going to go.
[8103.72s -> 8105.48s]  Let's make sure everyone's equipped.
[8111.86s -> 8112.90s]  Don't step on anything.
[8112.90s -> 8113.38s]  Be careful.
[8114.18s -> 8115.62s]  You should light your torch over here.
[8118.74s -> 8119.78s]  Hey, give me the thing.
[8120.42s -> 8122.34s]  I'll light it for you and hand it back to you.
[8122.98s -> 8130.66s]  How do I want to light this?
[8131.30s -> 8133.10s]  What's wrong with me?
[8138.07s -> 8138.55s]  Oh, whatever.
[8138.55s -> 8138.95s]  I don't care.
[8138.95s -> 8139.35s]  Just take it.
[8140.07s -> 8141.78s]  Okay, let's go.
[8142.34s -> 8148.30s]  Can I have them like collect berries and shit?
[8148.86s -> 8150.25s]  Do you pick berries up?
[8152.87s -> 8155.11s]  Inspect, wait, wander, play.
[8157.30s -> 8157.86s]  Wait, what?
[8158.34s -> 8158.82s]  Come with me.
[8159.62s -> 8161.21s]  I need somebody to pick this up
[8161.21s -> 8163.53s]  and I need you to put it down on the corrupted area.
[8168.04s -> 8172.60s]  Follow me.
[8172.60s -> 8175.06s]  Wait, who should pick it up?
[8175.78s -> 8176.82s]  Should I have the kid pick it up?
[8178.20s -> 8179.88s]  This chat is so fucking funny.
[8180.60s -> 8181.80s]  Yeah, they're fun.
[8182.36s -> 8184.92s]  Okay, pick it up.
[8185.99s -> 8186.71s]  Get it.
[8186.71s -> 8187.43s]  Now bring it with me.
[8189.75s -> 8190.71s]  This kid is so slow.
[8190.71s -> 8191.43s]  Who's this kid?
[8195.85s -> 8197.93s]  All right, we just need to bring this over to the thing
[8197.93s -> 8204.90s]  and put it down and I heal the tree.
[8204.90s -> 8205.62s]  Problem solved.
[8206.26s -> 8217.80s]  Don't drop that.
[8218.36s -> 8225.99s]  Keep going.
[8227.50s -> 8228.30s]  All right, put it right here.
[8231.50s -> 8231.90s]  Right here.
[8233.40s -> 8234.20s]  Drop it.
[8234.20s -> 8234.68s]  Put it down.
[8240.20s -> 8240.44s]  Okay.
[8245.18s -> 8246.78s]  No, put it down right here.
[8246.78s -> 8248.82s]  Put it down right here.
[8248.82s -> 8249.38s]  Put it down.
[8250.18s -> 8252.57s]  All right, now what?
[8255.37s -> 8256.41s]  Do I have to break it?
[8256.41s -> 8259.14s]  Oh god, what's happening?
[8259.14s -> 8262.74s]  Is it working?
[8262.74s -> 8265.56s]  I think it's working.
[8266.62s -> 8267.26s]  Is this working?
[8267.90s -> 8273.00s]  Should I break it?
[8282.52s -> 8282.84s]  Fuck.
[8287.75s -> 8288.71s]  No, get out of here.
[8288.71s -> 8289.43s]  Get out of the way.
[8290.17s -> 8291.45s]  Get out of the way.
[8291.45s -> 8292.01s]  What happened?
[8293.45s -> 8294.17s]  Why is it not?
[8294.81s -> 8295.61s]  What did it turn into?
[8295.61s -> 8296.33s]  Purifying?
[8297.54s -> 8298.58s]  It purifies to...
[8300.63s -> 8301.43s]  What the fuck?
[8304.26s -> 8305.30s]  I put it on the X.
[8307.37s -> 8308.65s]  No, I'm not soft-locked.
[8308.65s -> 8309.69s]  I'm fine.
[8309.69s -> 8310.57s]  I'm gonna be fine.
[8310.57s -> 8311.13s]  Don't worry.
[8311.13s -> 8311.69s]  I'm fine.
[8313.26s -> 8313.66s]  What?
[8313.66s -> 8314.62s]  Why did I break it?
[8314.62s -> 8315.18s]  I broke it.
[8315.82s -> 8320.28s]  We're gonna get out of here.
[8320.28s -> 8321.72s]  Bring sanctum to the cursed tree.
[8321.72s -> 8322.76s]  Didn't I do that?
[8322.76s -> 8325.88s]  Okay.
[8325.88s -> 8327.56s]  Where's that fucking huge thing?
[8328.20s -> 8332.47s]  I didn't place it on the X.
[8332.47s -> 8333.59s]  I mean, I put it right on the X.
[8339.83s -> 8340.15s]  All right.
[8340.15s -> 8340.71s]  Why don't you just...
[8341.35s -> 8341.59s]  Here.
[8342.79s -> 8343.19s]  Just...
[8343.19s -> 8344.39s]  Why don't you just fucking take this?
[8344.95s -> 8347.19s]  Turn into a fucking chicken for all I care.
[8347.19s -> 8348.23s]  I need to get rid of stuff.
[8350.33s -> 8351.29s]  I can't even eat this.
[8351.29s -> 8351.53s]  All right.
[8351.53s -> 8352.09s]  I'm almost there.
[8352.89s -> 8355.61s]  All right.
[8355.61s -> 8355.93s]  We're good.
[8359.64s -> 8360.36s]  Just go home.
[8360.36s -> 8361.00s]  Go back to the camp.
[8361.00s -> 8361.64s]  We'll talk later.
[8368.78s -> 8369.26s]  No, no, no, no.
[8369.26s -> 8369.50s]  Don't fight.
[8369.50s -> 8369.82s]  Don't fight.
[8369.82s -> 8370.14s]  Don't fight.
[8370.14s -> 8370.46s]  Just leave.
[8371.10s -> 8375.51s]  So was that not what I was supposed to do?
[8376.15s -> 8378.63s]  I mean, it was like put the vessel on the X.
[8378.63s -> 8379.99s]  I put it on the X and I didn't do anything.
[8380.71s -> 8383.48s]  What happened?
[8383.48s -> 8391.03s]  You dropped it?
[8391.03s -> 8391.75s]  You didn't put it.
[8399.88s -> 8400.84s]  I almost did it.
[8401.40s -> 8403.02s]  Oh, well.
[8403.58s -> 8405.85s]  Can I learn anything about these?
[8406.65s -> 8414.54s]  Okay.
[8414.54s -> 8415.10s]  Here.
[8415.10s -> 8418.33s]  Okay.
[8418.33s -> 8419.69s]  I'm going to give you some potions.
[8420.33s -> 8421.70s]  Makes sense.
[8422.34s -> 8424.44s]  And take some fucking eggs and stuff, too.
[8424.44s -> 8425.16s]  You can't have the stick.
[8425.16s -> 8425.72s]  That's for the dog.
[8426.28s -> 8430.68s]  I'm keeping the beef and eggs.
[8432.73s -> 8437.56s]  Okay.
[8437.56s -> 8440.36s]  So I needed a hundred more coins to get another one of those vessels.
[8440.36s -> 8446.44s]  So you're saying I needed to place it instead of put it.
[8446.44s -> 8447.51s]  Is that what you're saying?
[8448.23s -> 8456.15s]  There was a put command, but I dropped it.
[8456.15s -> 8461.16s]  I feel like I pressed it.
[8461.16s -> 8461.96s]  How much money do I have?
[8462.76s -> 8463.37s]  All right.
[8463.37s -> 8464.33s]  I just need to sell some shit.
[8465.21s -> 8466.89s]  I have enough potions to sell stuff.
[8467.77s -> 8470.92s]  Hold the button like when you gather.
[8477.66s -> 8482.33s]  I think there's some quest to turn it over here.
[8482.33s -> 8482.65s]  Okay.
[8482.65s -> 8488.04s]  I have aging.
[8488.04s -> 8489.32s]  I don't have any aging, do I?
[8489.32s -> 8489.56s]  No.
[8490.81s -> 8492.01s]  Hey, you know the things I just gave you?
[8492.01s -> 8492.49s]  Give them back.
[8493.13s -> 8493.90s]  Thank you.
[8497.29s -> 8498.65s]  Healing plus, right?
[8498.65s -> 8499.45s]  Oh, it's healing.
[8499.45s -> 8500.65s]  I have healing plus plus.
[8503.85s -> 8504.81s]  Don't I have a bunch of these?
[8507.69s -> 8508.97s]  That was a funny joke.
[8508.97s -> 8509.69s]  I mean, I thought I was.
[8509.69s -> 8510.57s]  I thought I put it down.
[8511.13s -> 8516.30s]  Okay.
[8516.30s -> 8522.01s]  I need I could equate add age.
[8524.39s -> 8525.27s]  Add age.
[8526.58s -> 8527.70s]  That's an age potion, right?
[8530.50s -> 8530.82s]  Really?
[8531.78s -> 8536.02s]  Add this.
[8536.74s -> 8538.95s]  What?
[8540.15s -> 8541.58s]  What are you talking about?
[8541.58s -> 8542.86s]  Add vitality, right?
[8543.42s -> 8544.26s]  Yeah, that's it.
[8544.26s -> 8545.14s]  Isn't that what I just did?
[8553.40s -> 8554.36s]  Wait, if I can I?
[8555.08s -> 8556.22s]  Okay, hold on.
[8556.22s -> 8556.94s]  Let me turn this on.
[8556.94s -> 8559.38s]  Okay.
[8559.38s -> 8560.58s]  How much money do I have?
[8560.58s -> 8565.29s]  23 damage plus healing plus is done.
[8567.50s -> 8568.30s]  Regular healing.
[8569.86s -> 8570.34s]  All right.
[8570.34s -> 8572.42s]  Aging and then aging plus.
[8573.22s -> 8575.06s]  All right.
[8575.06s -> 8576.90s]  I need to do add and then 10.
[8577.62s -> 8578.26s]  Okay.
[8578.26s -> 8580.33s]  I think I can do it.
[8580.97s -> 8584.60s]  Can you get a cake pop?
[8585.40s -> 8590.78s]  Okay.
[8590.78s -> 8591.26s]  Add.
[8591.26s -> 8592.54s]  I don't have the materials for it.
[8593.90s -> 8596.63s]  Did I stash them?
[8597.35s -> 8600.66s]  No, I did not.
[8600.66s -> 8601.22s]  All right.
[8601.22s -> 8602.26s]  I have 38.
[8603.85s -> 8604.49s]  But here's the thing.
[8604.49s -> 8607.69s]  I think I can use those potions on the big scary raven thing.
[8611.13s -> 8611.93s]  Purifying, right?
[8612.74s -> 8613.46s]  Will that work?
[8614.02s -> 8615.38s]  Maybe I should try to use this on some stuff.
[8628.41s -> 8629.13s]  Oh, yeah.
[8629.13s -> 8629.93s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8629.93s -> 8630.41s]  This might work.
[8630.97s -> 8633.46s]  Can I actually get in here?
[8633.46s -> 8636.71s]  That's a good idea.
[8637.27s -> 8638.38s]  That's right.
[8639.78s -> 8640.66s]  Oh, all right.
[8640.66s -> 8640.90s]  Nice.
[8640.90s -> 8641.70s]  Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[8641.70s -> 8642.26s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[8642.26s -> 8642.74s]  What's in here?
[8646.28s -> 8647.08s]  Adderstone?
[8647.80s -> 8648.92s]  Wait, what's this little guy?
[8650.22s -> 8652.38s]  Wait, stop.
[8653.18s -> 8656.31s]  Wait, get over here.
[8658.81s -> 8659.69s]  What's wrong with this guy?
[8660.33s -> 8664.89s]  He's just going to leave.
[8665.61s -> 8667.05s]  Okay.
[8667.05s -> 8668.01s]  Well, I got an adderstone.
[8668.01s -> 8669.29s]  I wonder what that is.
[8669.29s -> 8675.62s]  What else is in here?
[8678.26s -> 8679.06s]  Sword recipe.
[8680.26s -> 8680.58s]  Run.
[8686.79s -> 8689.99s]  An ordinary house that can be used for sweeping out dust and uninvited guests.
[8689.99s -> 8690.63s]  So it's just kind of a...
[8691.35s -> 8692.73s]  What does it do?
[8693.53s -> 8699.18s]  Do you want this thing?
[8699.74s -> 8701.96s]  I think that's a smelter.
[8705.66s -> 8706.78s]  What is this thing?
[8706.78s -> 8718.14s]  All right.
[8718.14s -> 8718.54s]  I have so much.
[8718.54s -> 8719.34s]  I'm going to store the glass.
[8720.30s -> 8729.18s]  Watching Jerma play this cured my hemorrhoids.
[8729.18s -> 8730.06s]  That's good.
[8730.06s -> 8733.61s]  All right.
[8733.61s -> 8734.33s]  I got metal scrap.
[8743.40s -> 8744.36s]  Come on.
[8744.36s -> 8745.48s]  Just get up the stairs.
[8746.44s -> 8747.88s]  You know you can get there.
[8747.88s -> 8753.54s]  I'll get there.
[8753.54s -> 8754.42s]  I'll get there soon.
[8754.42s -> 8755.22s]  Don't worry.
[8755.22s -> 8755.62s]  I'm there.
[8756.34s -> 8766.46s]  That's a I shit my pants walk if I've ever seen it.
[8766.46s -> 8768.78s]  I mean, I'm just like a thing of bones.
[8768.78s -> 8769.98s]  I'm like a bag of bones.
[8770.70s -> 8772.71s]  I need to get 15 of these.
[8773.43s -> 8781.22s]  Okay.
[8781.22s -> 8786.20s]  Store some of this stuff because I don't need like all this glass.
[8788.44s -> 8789.24s]  Inventory full.
[8789.24s -> 8789.40s]  Yeah.
[8789.40s -> 8789.88s]  Put it away.
[8795.40s -> 8798.07s]  You can't take any more.
[8798.07s -> 8798.87s]  I'm trying to put it away.
[8799.91s -> 8801.90s]  How do I put it away?
[8801.90s -> 8802.46s]  Put wait.
[8804.54s -> 8804.78s]  Huh?
[8805.50s -> 8806.62s]  Can I not put the glass away?
[8807.50s -> 8813.75s]  I'm going to go make an axe.
[8814.31s -> 8816.76s]  I think I can make a sword now.
[8825.83s -> 8826.31s]  Okay.
[8826.31s -> 8827.66s]  Let me make an axe.
[8831.40s -> 8833.00s]  But my hemorrhoids are still there.
[8839.16s -> 8839.56s]  Hey, you.
[8842.55s -> 8843.43s]  Wait, you're not my friend.
[8844.54s -> 8844.94s]  Fuck off.
[8845.50s -> 8854.42s]  Okay.
[8854.42s -> 8856.02s]  I'm I still got money.
[8856.02s -> 8859.50s]  I'm going to try to cure.
[8859.50s -> 8860.54s]  I want to purify that thing.
[8862.17s -> 8862.97s]  The scary thing.
[8865.54s -> 8865.86s]  Okay.
[8866.50s -> 8867.06s]  Stag.
[8868.02s -> 8868.34s]  Axe.
[8868.90s -> 8869.46s]  Pick lock.
[8869.46s -> 8870.26s]  I want one of these.
[8873.05s -> 8873.93s]  I want an axe.
[8874.81s -> 8875.85s]  And I want a pick lock.
[8876.41s -> 8877.77s]  But I only I can't do two.
[8878.57s -> 8879.53s]  What's this?
[8879.53s -> 8880.57s]  What is a stag?
[8880.57s -> 8884.10s]  It's like you pick up hot coals with.
[8884.10s -> 8884.50s]  What is that?
[8885.06s -> 8893.38s]  Well, I need an axe.
[8893.38s -> 8894.42s]  I'm not going to make it.
[8894.42s -> 8898.47s]  Can I just make two?
[8899.03s -> 8901.34s]  Maybe I should make a stag.
[8901.34s -> 8902.30s]  I don't know what it does.
[8902.30s -> 8903.58s]  Remove three vitality.
[8903.58s -> 8903.90s]  That's it.
[8908.89s -> 8909.77s]  I don't know.
[8909.77s -> 8910.89s]  I'll make two axes though.
[8910.89s -> 8911.61s]  I feel like I need it.
[8912.49s -> 8922.78s]  How's the dog?
[8923.83s -> 8924.71s]  I have a chicken now.
[8927.58s -> 8928.14s]  Oh, wait.
[8928.14s -> 8929.26s]  This is all right.
[8929.26s -> 8930.22s]  This is Julie.
[8930.22s -> 8930.70s]  I forgot.
[8931.26s -> 8933.00s]  How do I turn Julie back?
[8933.64s -> 8937.64s]  Oh, God.
[8937.64s -> 8938.52s]  Okay, Julie.
[8942.34s -> 8945.54s]  Julie, I'm going to take your stuff.
[8945.54s -> 8946.42s]  Three metal scraps.
[8946.42s -> 8946.82s]  Oh, yeah.
[8950.26s -> 8950.82s]  Here, come here.
[8950.82s -> 8953.14s]  I need you to take some shit from me.
[8953.78s -> 8954.82s]  So you stay right there.
[8955.54s -> 8957.77s]  Take a bunch of this bullshit.
[8957.77s -> 8958.49s]  Here, take this.
[8959.29s -> 8961.26s]  Take a couple pieces of glass.
[8961.26s -> 8961.90s]  Take a hair.
[8964.60s -> 8966.60s]  Take two fucking pumpkins for all I care.
[8966.60s -> 8967.72s]  I need to go make a sword.
[8968.52s -> 8976.44s]  I got to turn.
[8977.16s -> 8978.60s]  Julie back to a human, I think.
[8989.54s -> 8990.18s]  Sword.
[8990.18s -> 8991.38s]  Do I make a sword or do I make a picklock?
[8991.38s -> 8991.78s]  What do I want?
[8992.50s -> 8995.18s]  Picklock is for the chest right outside the door.
[8995.74s -> 8997.18s]  Or do I just have a sword and kill stuff?
[8997.90s -> 9006.68s]  What do you think?
[9006.68s -> 9007.24s]  Oh, come on.
[9007.24s -> 9007.56s]  Really?
[9008.58s -> 9012.25s]  I need charcoal by cooking food first.
[9013.94s -> 9015.62s]  Okay, I think I have food to make.
[9016.34s -> 9019.18s]  I'll make it.
[9021.38s -> 9022.42s]  I don't think I need the sword.
[9022.42s -> 9023.62s]  I feel the sword is not going to help me.
[9024.26s -> 9025.86s]  It's already have an axe.
[9025.86s -> 9038.06s]  I can make cooked mushrooms.
[9039.59s -> 9045.91s]  Okay, that should be enough.
[9047.03s -> 9048.47s]  There you go.
[9049.51s -> 9053.05s]  Okay, now I can make the picklock and I'll go open that thing.
[9055.40s -> 9056.12s]  How much money do you have?
[9056.84s -> 9058.28s]  I think I'm just going to kill you and take your money.
[9059.32s -> 9060.92s]  Honestly, these guys have five, ten bucks each.
[9067.91s -> 9069.99s]  These dudes got five to ten dollars each.
[9069.99s -> 9071.19s]  I mean, I need money.
[9071.19s -> 9072.95s]  I fucked up the last thing I was trying to do.
[9073.75s -> 9078.89s]  Okay, can I make more than one?
[9078.89s -> 9081.10s]  I'll make two.
[9083.46s -> 9088.82s]  All right, let's go feed the dog and feed this guy too.
[9088.82s -> 9090.02s]  You want some food?
[9090.02s -> 9092.22s]  You want some shrooms?
[9092.22s -> 9096.06s]  Here, you want it?
[9097.66s -> 9102.07s]  No, I can't.
[9102.07s -> 9103.51s]  I can't feed anybody fried mushrooms.
[9107.85s -> 9108.49s]  All right, here we go.
[9108.49s -> 9108.81s]  Steak.
[9111.06s -> 9112.02s]  I think you're hungry.
[9112.58s -> 9113.46s]  You should just come with me too.
[9119.56s -> 9120.44s]  Should I bring the chicken?
[9123.27s -> 9123.59s]  Free?
[9124.23s -> 9125.77s]  Okay, you should be well fed.
[9126.65s -> 9129.93s]  All right, you two follow me because I need the help here.
[9129.93s -> 9130.25s]  Let's go.
[9130.97s -> 9132.89s]  Put on the axe.
[9133.53s -> 9135.94s]  Let's go try to make some more money.
[9144.94s -> 9146.30s]  Eighty nine percent already.
[9146.30s -> 9147.98s]  The lockpick thing is right there.
[9147.98s -> 9151.42s]  All right, like just hold on.
[9151.42s -> 9152.86s]  I can't sleep, so I can't pass time.
[9155.78s -> 9156.10s]  I can't.
[9156.10s -> 9156.82s]  I don't have time to get it.
[9157.46s -> 9160.09s]  Can I?
[9160.09s -> 9161.85s]  I can wait in the menu, right?
[9161.85s -> 9163.46s]  I thought I could.
[9163.46s -> 9163.94s]  Yeah, wait.
[9165.54s -> 9166.42s]  Waiting.
[9166.42s -> 9169.19s]  Okay, what time is it?
[9171.78s -> 9172.26s]  Is it good?
[9173.06s -> 9177.32s]  Oh, shit.
[9177.32s -> 9181.24s]  No, it takes like five seconds to get through.
[9181.80s -> 9185.99s]  Okay, wait.
[9188.73s -> 9189.93s]  I wonder what the timer is like.
[9196.12s -> 9197.08s]  Kill Julie.
[9197.08s -> 9198.20s]  I'm not going to kill Julie.
[9198.84s -> 9205.53s]  Why would I go kill?
[9205.53s -> 9207.37s]  I mean, Julie is...
[9207.37s -> 9208.41s]  I need to fix.
[9208.41s -> 9209.29s]  I need to fix Julie.
[9209.85s -> 9213.24s]  All right, it's currently going on.
[9213.24s -> 9216.44s]  I need to do a remove change on Julie.
[9217.08s -> 9218.36s]  Well, maybe Julie should just come with us.
[9222.09s -> 9224.25s]  Okay, if Julie comes with us, Julie's going to die.
[9224.81s -> 9225.77s]  So I'm not doing that.
[9228.17s -> 9228.97s]  All right, there's the storm.
[9231.75s -> 9232.55s]  Storm is there.
[9233.83s -> 9237.75s]  I'll try to purify the big giant raven dog thing.
[9237.75s -> 9238.31s]  See if it works.
[9238.95s -> 9242.95s]  Are you not live?
[9242.95s -> 9243.27s]  Really?
[9245.90s -> 9246.46s]  No, I'm not.
[9246.46s -> 9247.34s]  I'm not live right now.
[9249.80s -> 9251.88s]  I recorded this and then put it up.
[9252.44s -> 9258.52s]  There's a video and I streamed it.
[9259.40s -> 9261.16s]  And then I downloaded that stream.
[9261.16s -> 9262.52s]  And then that's the one that you're seeing now.
[9263.40s -> 9266.63s]  All right, let's go.
[9267.19s -> 9272.58s]  One percent.
[9272.58s -> 9273.22s]  I got plenty of time.
[9273.86s -> 9275.34s]  I want to open the chest up here.
[9275.34s -> 9276.62s]  And then I'm going to try to throw one of those
[9276.62s -> 9278.14s]  purifying pushes at the big scary thing.
[9283.45s -> 9284.73s]  Where is that chest?
[9284.73s -> 9286.50s]  It's like right here, isn't it?
[9286.50s -> 9294.92s]  Wasn't it like right here?
[9295.56s -> 9299.93s]  Where is it?
[9300.49s -> 9305.67s]  Where was that chest?
[9306.23s -> 9313.54s]  Oh, yeah, I think this is...
[9314.34s -> 9315.14s]  Guys, get it.
[9315.14s -> 9315.46s]  Kill it.
[9316.10s -> 9316.50s]  Kill it.
[9320.28s -> 9320.68s]  Kill it.
[9321.32s -> 9322.92s]  Thank you.
[9326.38s -> 9327.26s]  Why is this hurting me?
[9327.26s -> 9333.82s]  All right, I need to drink something.
[9333.82s -> 9334.94s]  Where's that lockpick thing?
[9335.50s -> 9343.03s]  Wasn't it like right here?
[9343.59s -> 9347.64s]  I need this.
[9352.23s -> 9355.05s]  Where's my friend?
[9355.69s -> 9356.87s]  What happened?
[9356.87s -> 9358.47s]  What happened to Clemens?
[9360.07s -> 9360.87s]  Where's Clemens?
[9361.43s -> 9363.46s]  Where did Clemens go?
[9364.68s -> 9365.48s]  I sent him home.
[9365.48s -> 9369.50s]  Oh, I pressed A on him.
[9369.50s -> 9370.62s]  He's not dead.
[9370.62s -> 9377.93s]  Let me see if this works.
[9382.98s -> 9384.10s]  Don't think that's...
[9384.10s -> 9384.98s]  I think that's locked.
[9385.70s -> 9386.98s]  Let me find that thing, though.
[9396.49s -> 9397.37s]  Is this a lock chest?
[9397.93s -> 9404.12s]  I have three moon stones.
[9405.74s -> 9406.94s]  Oh, fuck off with this.
[9407.58s -> 9410.18s]  What do I get rid of?
[9411.32s -> 9411.88s]  Here, come here.
[9411.88s -> 9412.68s]  You have inventory, right?
[9415.18s -> 9415.98s]  Take like everything.
[9416.78s -> 9421.75s]  Okay, there you go.
[9422.76s -> 9423.80s]  What the fuck happened?
[9424.76s -> 9425.24s]  Are we all right?
[9426.58s -> 9428.58s]  Dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog.
[9428.58s -> 9429.30s]  Run, run, run.
[9429.30s -> 9430.02s]  Run over, get over.
[9430.02s -> 9431.06s]  Please don't die.
[9431.06s -> 9431.46s]  Don't die.
[9431.46s -> 9432.50s]  That'd be so awful if you do.
[9433.06s -> 9436.06s]  Go home, go home, go home.
[9436.06s -> 9436.62s]  Go, go home.
[9437.18s -> 9438.66s]  Leave, go home.
[9438.66s -> 9439.37s]  I don't want you...
[9439.37s -> 9440.01s]  Just don't die.
[9440.01s -> 9440.57s]  Leave.
[9440.57s -> 9442.09s]  Don't walk home.
[9442.09s -> 9442.65s]  Run home.
[9443.21s -> 9444.81s]  Don't walk home, run home.
[9444.81s -> 9445.21s]  Just run.
[9446.01s -> 9446.49s]  He's gonna get...
[9446.49s -> 9447.45s]  He's gonna step on something.
[9447.45s -> 9448.41s]  He's gonna fucking die.
[9449.21s -> 9450.65s]  Don't be quick about it.
[9452.49s -> 9454.58s]  Go home.
[9454.58s -> 9455.06s]  Is that gonna...
[9455.06s -> 9455.62s]  Is he gonna die?
[9456.18s -> 9456.90s]  I can't heal him.
[9456.90s -> 9458.66s]  Oh, he's over in comfort.
[9459.98s -> 9460.46s]  Hold on.
[9460.46s -> 9461.10s]  I'll fix it.
[9461.66s -> 9462.54s]  I'll fix it.
[9462.54s -> 9463.18s]  He can always die.
[9463.18s -> 9464.30s]  He's got three pounds.
[9465.51s -> 9466.71s]  He's gonna be okay.
[9467.27s -> 9468.31s]  I think he's gonna be fine.
[9471.66s -> 9473.98s]  I'm gonna purify that giant alien.
[9473.98s -> 9474.78s]  Let's purify this.
[9475.50s -> 9480.09s]  It doesn't work.
[9480.73s -> 9482.44s]  More than one?
[9486.31s -> 9486.79s]  It worked.
[9490.17s -> 9492.14s]  Um, what do I do?
[9492.78s -> 9496.34s]  Do I feed it?
[9496.34s -> 9499.37s]  What does it want?
[9499.37s -> 9499.85s]  What does it eat?
[9500.41s -> 9506.06s]  Would you eat worms?
[9506.62s -> 9513.75s]  What kind of food do they eat?
[9513.75s -> 9514.79s]  Favorite food?
[9514.79s -> 9515.19s]  I don't know.
[9515.83s -> 9517.93s]  Maybe it's the same thing.
[9526.28s -> 9526.68s]  I don't know.
[9526.68s -> 9531.61s]  I don't have anything.
[9531.61s -> 9532.41s]  Okay, here we go.
[9532.41s -> 9532.73s]  Chest.
[9533.67s -> 9533.99s]  Open.
[9535.38s -> 9536.26s]  Skeleton key.
[9538.76s -> 9540.84s]  Choose a direction in which to move your pick lock.
[9540.84s -> 9543.40s]  Be aware that choosing the wrong direction will force you to start over.
[9544.89s -> 9545.21s]  Okay.
[9549.51s -> 9550.07s]  Pick lock.
[9555.62s -> 9559.32s]  Um, up, down, no.
[9559.32s -> 9561.83s]  Okay, up, up, down, down.
[9562.94s -> 9564.46s]  Up, up, down, up.
[9564.46s -> 9566.95s]  I'll take the whole thing, please.
[9568.12s -> 9568.44s]  Cool.
[9569.00s -> 9577.69s]  Okay.
[9577.69s -> 9578.81s]  That's an interesting concept.
[9579.37s -> 9584.04s]  So wait.
[9584.04s -> 9587.72s]  So I can throw the anti-corruption thing on these guys, right?
[9587.72s -> 9589.16s]  That would, that should work.
[9591.56s -> 9592.76s]  Porter and Benson.
[9592.76s -> 9593.56s]  All right, let me try it.
[9594.36s -> 9601.62s]  Shit, it wasn't enough.
[9601.62s -> 9625.05s]  Didn't work, so you decide to kill them.
[9627.70s -> 9629.94s]  I mean, what am I, what am I supposed to do?
[9630.66s -> 9640.41s]  All right, I'm heading back.
[9640.41s -> 9641.93s]  Oh, I can't move when I'm like this.
[9643.45s -> 9644.49s]  Uh, 46.
[9646.58s -> 9647.70s]  Add one perk?
[9647.70s -> 9648.66s]  I wonder what the bottles do.
[9653.77s -> 9657.32s]  Um, all right, I'm just gonna like, get this.
[9659.27s -> 9666.55s]  Is that enough?
[9667.11s -> 9669.64s]  Okay.
[9669.64s -> 9670.20s]  No.
[9670.20s -> 9671.86s]  Let's eat something.
[9672.42s -> 9677.52s]  Okay.
[9678.24s -> 9681.32s]  Let me get rid of the tea leaves.
[9681.32s -> 9682.12s]  Oh, I don't even need.
[9682.12s -> 9683.72s]  Okay, I don't need the fucking five torches.
[9684.76s -> 9686.43s]  Okay.
[9686.43s -> 9687.66s]  Did you have anything else?
[9688.30s -> 9691.76s]  All right, let's go back.
[9692.32s -> 9697.64s]  How's the spice rack coming?
[9697.64s -> 9698.36s]  It's coming along.
[9699.08s -> 9702.80s]  All right, good.
[9702.80s -> 9703.28s]  You made it back.
[9703.92s -> 9706.59s]  You got a whole inventory full of shit, right?
[9707.31s -> 9710.54s]  31.
[9711.42s -> 9714.51s]  Hydration check.
[9715.23s -> 9716.73s]  You got it.
[9716.73s -> 9724.00s]  Is this game to the end of the stream?
[9724.00s -> 9725.93s]  The end of the stream is probably happening soon here.
[9729.04s -> 9729.76s]  How long did we stream for?
[9729.76s -> 9730.32s]  Like seven hours?
[9731.20s -> 9735.55s]  I want a skeleton frog.
[9735.55s -> 9736.19s]  How do you get this?
[9737.15s -> 9738.67s]  You have like cool pets.
[9738.67s -> 9739.15s]  That's not fair.
[9739.87s -> 9747.37s]  And then you guys will see me again on Monday.
[9747.93s -> 9755.58s]  This game looks cute.
[9755.58s -> 9756.06s]  It is cute.
[9756.62s -> 9762.09s]  It's far more efficient ways to play this game.
[9762.09s -> 9764.33s]  I am certain of it, but I'm having a good time.
[9766.54s -> 9767.26s]  Okay.
[9767.26s -> 9768.86s]  I wish I could make the potion.
[9768.86s -> 9770.30s]  It makes me a skeleton guy.
[9772.68s -> 9773.32s]  Samantha.
[9773.96s -> 9777.50s]  Samantha, you have $10 on you.
[9777.50s -> 9780.14s]  And I'm like, I just, I don't want to know how much money you have.
[9780.86s -> 9783.28s]  Oh, there you are.
[9783.84s -> 9785.39s]  Give me that.
[9785.95s -> 9793.58s]  I can make a pepper.
[9794.14s -> 9804.89s]  I like the music.
[9804.89s -> 9805.29s]  Yeah.
[9805.29s -> 9805.85s]  The music is good.
[9806.57s -> 9808.38s]  We should watch some old PSAs.
[9809.18s -> 9810.46s]  I definitely want to do some more infomercials.
[9810.46s -> 9811.90s]  I want to do some more longer infomercials.
[9811.90s -> 9812.86s]  Those are a lot of fun.
[9813.66s -> 9816.96s]  Okay.
[9816.96s -> 9818.00s]  What was I just going to do?
[9818.72s -> 9824.08s]  Who's moving?
[9824.08s -> 9826.56s]  Wait, why did you just move me here?
[9827.20s -> 9828.83s]  I didn't do that.
[9828.83s -> 9829.71s]  Why is it what I'm doing?
[9829.71s -> 9830.35s]  Is this like an event?
[9830.35s -> 9831.07s]  Am I supposed to be here?
[9831.79s -> 9834.40s]  What am I doing here?
[9835.04s -> 9839.92s]  What happened to Benson?
[9839.92s -> 9840.16s]  What?
[9840.80s -> 9842.12s]  My dog?
[9842.12s -> 9843.40s]  Oh no, I killed Benson.
[9843.40s -> 9843.96s]  All right.
[9843.96s -> 9844.52s]  Fuck Benson.
[9844.52s -> 9844.84s]  Who cares?
[9846.62s -> 9849.26s]  I was so concerned for one second.
[9850.06s -> 9852.04s]  I thought that was one of my friends.
[9859.55s -> 9860.27s]  Oops.
[9860.27s -> 9863.34s]  All right.
[9863.34s -> 9864.94s]  There's the moonstone thing, right?
[9869.31s -> 9870.27s]  This is the moonstone thing.
[9870.99s -> 9871.71s]  I'm certain of it.
[9873.61s -> 9873.85s]  Yep.
[9874.41s -> 9874.89s]  Yep.
[9874.89s -> 9875.37s]  Yep.
[9875.37s -> 9875.77s]  Yep.
[9875.77s -> 9876.17s]  Okay.
[9876.17s -> 9877.77s]  I have three moonstones.
[9877.77s -> 9878.57s]  They're back at the house.
[9879.13s -> 9880.25s]  The corruption thing is going to happen.
[9880.25s -> 9881.93s]  I'm going to open the moonstone chest
[9881.93s -> 9884.09s]  and then I'm going to get a hundred dollars
[9884.09s -> 9884.97s]  and we're going to take
[9885.77s -> 9887.69s]  the group of fucking idiots back over here.
[9888.49s -> 9893.80s]  I have so much stuff.
[9893.80s -> 9894.44s]  I got a store.
[9896.25s -> 9897.05s]  Strup.
[9897.05s -> 9897.61s]  Strup is...
[9898.57s -> 9899.76s]  Okay.
[9900.40s -> 9901.05s]  All right.
[9901.05s -> 9903.93s]  I'm coming back here with three moonstones.
[9903.93s -> 9913.37s]  For real.
[9913.37s -> 9915.05s]  I'm opening that moonstone chest
[9915.05s -> 9917.68s]  and it's going to be a hundred bucks in it.
[9917.68s -> 9920.48s]  It's going to be amazing.
[9921.04s -> 9928.38s]  Any more of these?
[9928.94s -> 9934.48s]  I don't think I have these.
[9935.12s -> 9936.64s]  Has anybody picked these up yet?
[9936.64s -> 9937.44s]  Come on, come get them.
[9938.16s -> 9940.46s]  Maybe I should stop killing townspeople.
[9940.46s -> 9941.26s]  Maybe that would help.
[9941.90s -> 9947.10s]  Here, I saw you at Chili's yesterday.
[9947.10s -> 9948.38s]  You ordered the chicken crispers,
[9948.38s -> 9950.06s]  peeled the crispers off and the chicken
[9950.06s -> 9951.98s]  and then swallowed the chicken meat whole like a snake.
[9954.65s -> 9955.53s]  Was that you?
[9955.53s -> 9956.41s]  Was that you watching?
[9956.41s -> 9956.89s]  Was that you?
[9957.69s -> 9961.05s]  All right.
[9961.05s -> 9961.77s]  Let me research.
[9967.07s -> 9968.11s]  Oh, I'm going to figure it out.
[9968.11s -> 9968.91s]  What's ghoul skin?
[9978.64s -> 9979.20s]  All right.
[9979.20s -> 9980.08s]  Dump all this crap.
[9985.31s -> 9985.79s]  Bottles.
[9987.52s -> 9988.48s]  Get this out of here.
[9989.28s -> 9991.74s]  I'm going to keep the pick logs.
[9991.74s -> 9993.34s]  I don't know what this dag is really for, but...
[9994.86s -> 9995.58s]  Textiles.
[9996.86s -> 9997.58s]  Use the tomb.
[9998.38s -> 9999.18s]  Keep the worms.
[9999.18s -> 9999.42s]  Okay.
[10001.61s -> 10002.65s]  I don't need as many berries.
[10003.29s -> 10008.43s]  This axe is almost dead.
[10008.43s -> 10009.31s]  I'm just going to throw it away.
[10011.61s -> 10011.85s]  Okay.
[10013.26s -> 10015.18s]  So now the plan is
[10015.98s -> 10018.78s]  make a hot chilling...
[10018.78s -> 10019.50s]  Sizzling pepper.
[10020.46s -> 10020.70s]  Cool.
[10028.28s -> 10029.40s]  You doing an EU stream?
[10030.20s -> 10030.68s]  No, I'm...
[10033.87s -> 10036.19s]  I'm interested enough in the game to kind of keep playing it.
[10036.83s -> 10039.84s]  I just want to see...
[10039.84s -> 10041.44s]  I want to see what I can do with this.
[10042.08s -> 10042.80s]  I need to know.
[10043.52s -> 10049.18s]  How much is it?
[10050.62s -> 10051.98s]  I've got 31 coins.
[10053.79s -> 10054.43s]  Excuse me?
[10055.15s -> 10062.88s]  Just stole my shit.
[10062.88s -> 10064.56s]  No, don't fight everybody in town.
[10065.12s -> 10067.36s]  Why is the skeleton fighting this kid?
[10067.36s -> 10069.20s]  Well, he just killed that kid.
[10069.20s -> 10070.24s]  You killed a kid.
[10070.96s -> 10072.08s]  You just killed a kid.
[10072.88s -> 10074.64s]  I have to kill everybody.
[10074.64s -> 10074.96s]  Why?
[10074.96s -> 10075.84s]  What's happening?
[10075.84s -> 10077.28s]  Why did you just do that?
[10077.28s -> 10077.92s]  I'm going to die.
[10077.92s -> 10078.56s]  Where's Clemens?
[10080.91s -> 10083.07s]  What the fuck was that?
[10085.15s -> 10087.15s]  He just beat that kid to death with a shovel.
[10088.80s -> 10090.32s]  What the fuck just happened?
[10091.21s -> 10092.17s]  I'm a human again.
[10093.60s -> 10094.24s]  I'm human.
[10094.24s -> 10095.28s]  I'm actually human again.
[10097.53s -> 10099.45s]  Dude, you just hit that kid with the...
[10099.45s -> 10101.05s]  Did you hit that kid in the face with the shovel?
[10101.05s -> 10101.77s]  Did that get dead?
[10103.15s -> 10104.75s]  I'm actually a human.
[10104.75s -> 10109.52s]  Honest to God, what the fuck just happened?
[10109.52s -> 10111.28s]  A rat stole my wallet.
[10112.00s -> 10114.08s]  So I hit the rat in the head with an axe.
[10114.08s -> 10116.56s]  And now everybody's dead.
[10117.44s -> 10118.97s]  Yeah, that...
[10120.40s -> 10121.04s]  Excuse me.
[10121.04s -> 10121.60s]  Excuse me.
[10134.17s -> 10135.45s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[10142.54s -> 10144.54s]  I forgot how good apples tasted.
[10145.18s -> 10146.92s]  I'm going to die again, aren't I?
[10147.88s -> 10150.04s]  Why are these people so fucking hostile?
[10153.90s -> 10155.18s]  All right, I need to eat food.
[10155.18s -> 10155.98s]  Ron, just run away.
[10155.98s -> 10156.46s]  Run away.
[10156.46s -> 10157.10s]  You killed...
[10160.09s -> 10161.21s]  This thing moved so fast.
[10161.21s -> 10161.45s]  I didn't...
[10161.45s -> 10162.01s]  Where's the chicken?
[10162.01s -> 10162.41s]  I need to...
[10162.41s -> 10163.45s]  Wait, go back to the camp.
[10163.45s -> 10163.77s]  The dog.
[10165.77s -> 10166.17s]  My dog.
[10166.17s -> 10167.37s]  My dog, dog, dog, dog, dog.
[10167.37s -> 10169.21s]  Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.
[10169.93s -> 10172.57s]  I gotta let the dog out.
[10172.57s -> 10173.29s]  The dog's gonna help.
[10176.48s -> 10177.12s]  Help me.
[10177.12s -> 10178.08s]  Help me.
[10178.08s -> 10178.80s]  Help me, please.
[10179.52s -> 10194.64s]  Oh, why can't I open the gate?
[10199.61s -> 10199.85s]  Help.
[10199.85s -> 10203.31s]  Oh no.
[10203.31s -> 10203.95s]  Help, please.
[10204.91s -> 10207.31s]  Protect me, protect me, protect me, protect me.
[10208.52s -> 10209.00s]  Protect me.
[10209.00s -> 10210.12s]  They killed Julie too.
[10211.42s -> 10211.98s]  Bastards.
[10215.04s -> 10218.25s]  Okay, just get me out.
[10219.84s -> 10221.60s]  This motherfucker chasing me with the shovel.
[10221.60s -> 10223.52s]  I need to pick up more health potions that are on the ground.
[10225.21s -> 10226.17s]  Where's the dog?
[10227.63s -> 10229.23s]  That's so fucked up.
[10229.23s -> 10230.19s]  That's so fucked up.
[10238.30s -> 10239.42s]  Stop, you fucker.
[10240.06s -> 10246.48s]  I need a weapon.
[10246.48s -> 10247.20s]  I'm gonna die again.
[10248.72s -> 10249.52s]  What happened to the dog?
[10250.40s -> 10251.76s]  All right, just go in here and close the gate.
[10251.76s -> 10252.56s]  They won't be able to get in.
[10253.12s -> 10256.83s]  Close, close, close, close.
[10256.83s -> 10258.35s]  Don't let this fucking giant snake in here.
[10260.73s -> 10261.05s]  Help.
[10271.45s -> 10272.41s]  Help me, please.
[10273.21s -> 10279.92s]  All right, I'm good.
[10279.92s -> 10280.32s]  I need...
[10280.32s -> 10281.04s]  I have an axe, right?
[10284.80s -> 10285.20s]  Julie.
[10286.33s -> 10286.57s]  No.
[10287.53s -> 10301.55s]  Did I get everything from the bag?
[10302.11s -> 10306.97s]  Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna die again.
[10307.53s -> 10308.01s]  He's running.
[10314.62s -> 10316.06s]  I'm so confused at what happened.
[10316.70s -> 10318.57s]  They're not gonna chase me over here, are they?
[10320.76s -> 10321.72s]  That was just chaos.
[10322.28s -> 10327.00s]  All right, none of you attack me, please.
[10328.04s -> 10330.44s]  There's a maniac over on the other side of town.
[10330.44s -> 10334.76s]  All right, sit down.
[10334.76s -> 10336.92s]  There's a fucking maniac over there.
[10351.55s -> 10351.87s]  Let me...
[10352.75s -> 10354.94s]  I need to eat some stuff.
[10355.82s -> 10358.97s]  This fish is raw.
[10359.69s -> 10364.12s]  Okay, let me cook this stuff.
[10364.76s -> 10368.94s]  You're supposed to talk to the owner about it,
[10368.94s -> 10371.34s]  but you just killed the rat after the rat stole?
[10371.34s -> 10372.78s]  I think the rats just steal.
[10372.78s -> 10373.66s]  I think they just do that.
[10374.62s -> 10383.61s]  Okay, getting better.
[10384.17s -> 10385.13s]  Just eat worms, whatever.
[10386.65s -> 10390.54s]  All right, what was the plan here?
[10391.58s -> 10398.38s]  Get rid of the broom.
[10399.02s -> 10399.82s]  I don't need these.
[10401.18s -> 10403.84s]  I don't need this much glass.
[10404.80s -> 10405.52s]  Store the hair.
[10405.52s -> 10406.64s]  Store the logs.
[10406.64s -> 10407.60s]  Store the mandragora.
[10408.48s -> 10409.68s]  Store the scrap.
[10409.68s -> 10410.32s]  Store the lab.
[10412.08s -> 10413.56s]  Store the hunger.
[10416.52s -> 10417.80s]  Yeah, I don't need the textiles.
[10418.36s -> 10422.04s]  Actually, I need to examine these.
[10422.68s -> 10432.40s]  Okay, add five vitality.
[10434.25s -> 10440.46s]  Okay, very nice.
[10444.96s -> 10446.32s]  Is that right speaker crow?
[10446.32s -> 10447.84s]  Every time I swear it's out of my window.
[10454.40s -> 10457.20s]  All right, let me see if I can get something done here.
[10460.83s -> 10462.59s]  Well, at least one thing you know from this game is
[10466.97s -> 10467.85s]  it's actually kind of...
[10468.96s -> 10469.84s]  You have to really think.
[10470.56s -> 10471.60s]  You can't just run around with a...
[10475.16s -> 10477.00s]  What do I do about this guy, though?
[10477.00s -> 10477.96s]  I mean, he's the kid.
[10478.76s -> 10481.07s]  I feel so bad about this.
[10482.88s -> 10483.92s]  What do I do about this?
[10488.81s -> 10490.49s]  It's this motherfucker right here.
[10490.49s -> 10495.96s]  What did you get?
[10496.78s -> 10498.38s]  All right, where's your boss?
[10499.18s -> 10505.88s]  Where's your boss?
[10506.60s -> 10511.21s]  Hi, Samantha.
[10520.30s -> 10521.26s]  Hey, Samantha, don't...
[10523.26s -> 10526.22s]  Don't pay no attention to the dead kid that's over here.
[10527.02s -> 10528.30s]  No, don't worry about that.
[10529.34s -> 10531.82s]  We're just going to be farming crops and shit together.
[10533.71s -> 10534.75s]  I forgot about Julie.
[10534.75s -> 10536.11s]  How do I get rid of them?
[10536.75s -> 10540.27s]  This is such a scary, awful, terrible reminder of the awful things happening.
[10542.78s -> 10543.74s]  I feel so bad.
[10544.54s -> 10545.66s]  At least the dog's still here.
[10554.06s -> 10558.27s]  I remember I had friends.
[10558.27s -> 10558.91s]  Hi, rogue.
[10567.29s -> 10569.37s]  Pay no attention to the dead kid, honest.
[10570.65s -> 10572.49s]  But that's in the video game.
[10573.13s -> 10574.09s]  That's in the video game.
[10578.11s -> 10582.51s]  Jerma, can you knock on the closet with the closest air vent in your room?
[10585.68s -> 10586.96s]  You are fucking weird, man.
[10591.24s -> 10592.28s]  You're fucking weird.
[10593.53s -> 10596.46s]  All right, I want...
[10596.94s -> 10599.55s]  Yeah, I can't believe I blew it.
[10599.55s -> 10602.51s]  I could have cleansed the tree by now and I fucked it all up.
[10603.85s -> 10607.37s]  I need another $70 and I need someone to carry the thing.
[10608.09s -> 10609.71s]  All right, I'm making money.
[10612.24s -> 10613.36s]  Dog, I need you to come with me.
[10619.13s -> 10619.77s]  You're pretty...
[10619.77s -> 10620.25s]  Yeah, you're good.
[10620.25s -> 10620.97s]  You got enough health.
[10621.61s -> 10627.47s]  Is that motherfucker?
[10628.11s -> 10633.72s]  What was that person's name?
[10634.28s -> 10642.70s]  I don't think it's still here.
[10643.42s -> 10648.48s]  Yeah, they've got...
[10648.48s -> 10649.60s]  There was somebody else.
[10649.60s -> 10655.02s]  I need to sell more stuff.
[10655.74s -> 10656.80s]  No, I don't.
[10656.80s -> 10657.20s]  Get out.
[10657.84s -> 10662.09s]  All right, it's been almost seven hours.
[10662.09s -> 10663.21s]  I should probably...
[10663.77s -> 10664.33s]  Call it tonight.
[10671.37s -> 10673.05s]  I need to pick that up.
[10673.05s -> 10680.28s]  All right, where's the...
[10680.28s -> 10681.24s]  Oh, the undertaker, right?
[10681.24s -> 10682.12s]  Let me do that.
[10682.12s -> 10687.28s]  This is a Q game.
[10688.08s -> 10691.68s]  Yeah, honestly, I think this is worth playing.
[10693.02s -> 10694.30s]  This might be a sponsored stream.
[10694.30s -> 10696.22s]  This is the first game sponsored stream I ever did.
[10698.19s -> 10700.99s]  I very much enjoyed myself as much as I was not very good.
[10702.81s -> 10704.17s]  Again, this is on Steam.
[10704.17s -> 10705.53s]  It's on PS5.
[10705.53s -> 10706.25s]  It's on Xbox.
[10706.25s -> 10706.65s]  It's on...
[10706.65s -> 10707.85s]  I think it's on pretty much everything.
[10710.32s -> 10711.76s]  What level of solid are your teeth?
[10712.70s -> 10713.26s]  Pretty solid.
[10713.98s -> 10718.54s]  Okay, so I need to be able to...
[10718.54s -> 10719.90s]  There are four bodies at the camp.
[10723.28s -> 10724.40s]  What, we're burying them?
[10725.12s -> 10727.18s]  I don't have four.
[10727.18s -> 10728.30s]  I don't have five shovels.
[10729.10s -> 10734.99s]  I actually have to bury them.
[10734.99s -> 10736.67s]  I need to make shovels to bury them.
[10739.36s -> 10740.96s]  I think there's definitely enough here.
[10741.76s -> 10744.81s]  I mean, I've been playing this for like almost three hours.
[10747.58s -> 10748.62s]  Oh, wait.
[10748.62s -> 10749.82s]  I can open this guy's chest.
[10749.82s -> 10751.10s]  Okay, no, I don't want to fuck this up.
[10751.10s -> 10752.78s]  Up, down, up, down.
[10753.42s -> 10755.74s]  Okay, up, down, up, up, up, up.
[10756.62s -> 10759.24s]  Butterflies.
[10759.88s -> 10760.20s]  Shovel.
[10761.00s -> 10761.80s]  Silver Cross.
[10762.68s -> 10765.95s]  Grants 5% chance to block incoming damage.
[10765.95s -> 10766.59s]  It's like a shield.
[10767.39s -> 10770.64s]  Cool.
[10772.83s -> 10774.92s]  Let's say read notes.
[10776.36s -> 10779.47s]  I feel like I haven't really scratched the surface of the game.
[10779.47s -> 10782.97s]  And I've just been kind of wandering around just doing dumb stuff.
[10786.32s -> 10788.24s]  If I had put that thing down and not placed it,
[10788.24s -> 10790.08s]  I would have been progressed much farther, I think.
[10793.23s -> 10794.35s]  But yeah, it's available.
[10794.35s -> 10795.87s]  They sponsored this part of the stream.
[10798.49s -> 10799.29s]  That's really cool.
[10799.37s -> 10803.69s]  I'm happy to do sponsorships for stuff that I think is interesting.
[10805.84s -> 10806.96s]  Going forward, I don't know.
[10806.96s -> 10807.68s]  We'll see.
[10807.68s -> 10808.88s]  I'm open to pretty much anything.
[10809.44s -> 10811.32s]  But this was the Serpent Rogue.
[10812.20s -> 10813.88s]  I would say I recommend it.
[10813.88s -> 10819.45s]  I think there's enough here to have fun.
[10820.17s -> 10821.44s]  I very much enjoyed it.
[10822.00s -> 10828.68s]  Yeah, I would probably rather do stuff like this
[10828.68s -> 10834.12s]  than do something that you've seen a thousand times, right?
[10834.84s -> 10836.04s]  For like a sponsorship.
[10836.04s -> 10837.24s]  But I mean, it depends.
[10837.24s -> 10838.20s]  What am I doing?
[10838.20s -> 10838.76s]  What's the point?
[10840.04s -> 10841.48s]  How many projects are coming up, right?
[10842.20s -> 10846.44s]  Yeah, I think hopefully I showed enough for you
[10846.44s -> 10848.68s]  to think if you want to check it out.
[10848.68s -> 10849.64s]  By all means, please do.
[10850.28s -> 10851.16s]  If not, then cool.
[10853.16s -> 10856.36s]  Huge, huge thank you to Team17 and Senji Games.
[10856.36s -> 10857.16s]  Hope I'm saying that right.
[10857.88s -> 10859.23s]  You got a cute little game here.
[10860.84s -> 10863.08s]  And I feel like I haven't really done anything.
[10863.08s -> 10864.20s]  And I've been playing for like three hours.
[10864.20s -> 10867.60s]  It seems like there's a lot to unpack.
[10868.32s -> 10875.29s]  But I'm very happy.
[10876.48s -> 10878.24s]  I think it's definitely worth playing.
[10883.16s -> 10885.32s]  And if you're coming up with a good system
[10885.32s -> 10887.48s]  when you first start, it's definitely worth.
[10887.48s -> 10888.84s]  This is a man-sized game.
[10888.84s -> 10890.60s]  Yeah, this is definitely a man-sized game.
[10903.37s -> 10904.57s]  Networking Andy?
[10904.57s -> 10905.37s]  That's no.
[10908.64s -> 10910.88s]  But yeah, I think that'll wrap it up.
[10910.88s -> 10911.44s]  Seven hours.
[10916.48s -> 10917.84s]  We should do the more infomercials.
[10917.84s -> 10918.64s]  We absolutely will.
[10918.64s -> 10919.44s]  That was so much fun.
[10922.48s -> 10923.76s]  That was an absolute blast.
[10927.08s -> 10929.24s]  Next stream is going to be Monday.
[10929.24s -> 10931.84s]  I don't really know what we're going to do yet.
[10931.84s -> 10935.85s]  The lockpicking looks sick.
[10935.85s -> 10938.17s]  I am going to imagine that eventually later on,
[10938.17s -> 10939.37s]  those are much harder.
[10941.85s -> 10945.21s]  I have, okay, the issue that I have with a game like this
[10945.21s -> 10947.95s]  is I don't want to let go of anything.
[10947.95s -> 10949.56s]  I want to keep everything.
[10949.56s -> 10953.29s]  I just want to keep every feather, every like chicken bone.
[10953.29s -> 10954.49s]  I just want to keep everything.
[10954.49s -> 10958.40s]  I just, I have to hold on to everything.
[10958.40s -> 10959.92s]  Can you take off your wig?
[10961.18s -> 10962.62s]  Nah, it's glued on.
[10962.62s -> 10969.20s]  This was neat.
[10969.20s -> 10972.80s]  Well, I hope it was at least worth and fun to watch
[10972.80s -> 10973.52s]  and worth checking out.
[10974.24s -> 10980.43s]  Well, see, I might just play this.
[10981.47s -> 10983.55s]  I don't know how much I'm going to stream it.
[10983.55s -> 10986.11s]  But I feel like it's kind of a fun game to play.
[10986.11s -> 10986.51s]  We'll see.
[10987.15s -> 10989.08s]  Oh, Stanley Parable is out, the new one.
[10989.08s -> 10989.48s]  That's right.
[10990.44s -> 10995.07s]  Maybe we'll do that on Monday.
[10995.07s -> 10995.71s]  But thank you.
[10995.71s -> 10998.67s]  This is the first ever game sponsor stream.
[10998.67s -> 11000.27s]  This is very new to me.
[11001.72s -> 11007.07s]  I would say you could probably expect stuff like this
[11007.07s -> 11008.19s]  to happen more often now.
[11008.19s -> 11011.93s]  Not all the time, but like I said to you earlier,
[11011.93s -> 11013.80s]  I've evolved.
[11013.80s -> 11014.84s]  I've been working with them now
[11014.84s -> 11016.68s]  and I've been presented a bunch of stuff.
[11016.68s -> 11020.17s]  This is the first thing that I thought was worth showcasing.
[11020.17s -> 11024.92s]  So they'll pop up from time to time.
[11024.92s -> 11025.64s]  You'll know what they are.
[11025.64s -> 11026.84s]  I'll make sure you know.
[11026.84s -> 11030.99s]  How's my sleep schedule?
[11030.99s -> 11031.55s]  It's not bad.
[11031.55s -> 11032.35s]  It's pretty good.
[11032.35s -> 11040.32s]  Variety streamer.
[11040.32s -> 11041.12s]  Yeah, we'll get a plan.
[11041.12s -> 11042.80s]  The Bugsnax DLC is out too.
[11042.80s -> 11044.01s]  Interesting.
[11050.91s -> 11052.11s]  What's the state of your port?
[11052.11s -> 11053.31s]  Do I have to save the game?
[11053.31s -> 11055.42s]  I think it just saves automatically, right?
[11056.22s -> 11058.46s]  32 people killed, one person healed.
[11059.63s -> 11061.79s]  One tamed, five deaths.
[11061.79s -> 11062.35s]  That's kind of cool.
[11062.35s -> 11062.99s]  Keeps track of that.
[11065.37s -> 11066.97s]  Let me see what else is in the menu here.
[11068.54s -> 11071.45s]  Okay, no, I think it's just single player.
[11071.45s -> 11072.65s]  Yeah, single player.
[11075.50s -> 11077.10s]  I just killed everybody I could.
[11077.10s -> 11079.42s]  But I didn't know.
[11079.98s -> 11088.43s]  I might get the game, honestly.
[11088.99s -> 11090.35s]  Yeah, you are free to.
[11090.35s -> 11091.87s]  If you don't want it or you do want it.
[11091.87s -> 11094.27s]  I mean, I'm not going to tell you what to do.
[11094.83s -> 11098.67s]  But I will tell you that I enjoyed that three hours that I just played.
[11099.31s -> 11101.69s]  That's it.
[11101.69s -> 11104.22s]  What's your favorite boss in Elden Rings?
[11106.32s -> 11107.28s]  Horror Loot.
[11107.28s -> 11115.61s]  The soundtrack is good too.
[11115.61s -> 11116.65s]  This is nice.
[11116.65s -> 11119.23s]  Maybe we'll have this play us up.
[11119.79s -> 11121.36s]  I like it.
[11121.36s -> 11126.84s]  Oh, never mind.
[11127.40s -> 11128.36s]  There we go.
[11128.36s -> 11131.20s]  How much does the game cost?
[11131.20s -> 11133.52s]  The game is right now, it is 10% off.
[11134.32s -> 11135.52s]  $17.99.
[11135.52s -> 11139.96s]  It'll probably go up to $19.20.
[11139.96s -> 11143.93s]  So on every platform, all the major ones on the new consoles.
[11144.57s -> 11155.96s]  Heavily focused on the crafting.
[11155.96s -> 11159.76s]  Which I probably could have done it a little more streamlined.
[11159.76s -> 11160.88s]  I could have been a little better about it.
[11160.88s -> 11163.12s]  But I just saw it and I was like, make potions.
[11174.60s -> 11175.64s]  This is a fun one today.
[11176.28s -> 11178.84s]  The infomercials then coming into this.
[11178.84s -> 11179.32s]  That was fun.
[11179.96s -> 11184.00s]  I had a very good time today.
[11184.00s -> 11185.20s]  Hope you all did too.
[11185.20s -> 11199.96s]  Will you play Inscription again at some point?
[11203.45s -> 11204.01s]  I don't know.
[11204.01s -> 11206.01s]  I feel like I want to play that on my own time.
[11206.01s -> 11211.26s]  I feel like my brain is too scattered to do a card game like that.
[11212.06s -> 11214.38s]  More infomercials?
[11214.38s -> 11214.70s]  We will.
[11216.57s -> 11217.61s]  It's not going to take very long.
[11218.17s -> 11222.49s]  I promise that we're not going to wait three or four weeks to do more infomercials.
[11223.05s -> 11226.59s]  We will do that within the next two or three streams.
[11226.59s -> 11228.19s]  We're just going to do that again immediately.
[11228.83s -> 11239.18s]  Don't forget to moisturize.
[11239.18s -> 11239.58s]  That's true.
[11241.79s -> 11243.07s]  You should absolutely moisturize.
[11246.40s -> 11251.58s]  Do Stanley Parable and infomercials on Monday.
[11254.01s -> 11255.05s]  That sounds like a good idea.
[11261.64s -> 11263.74s]  Very cool.
[11263.74s -> 11264.06s]  All right.
[11264.06s -> 11267.66s]  Again, thank you so much to Team17 and Cengi Games.
[11269.24s -> 11270.68s]  Thanks for watching that.
[11270.68s -> 11273.88s]  I know that sponsored content is something you're not used to on this stream
[11273.88s -> 11275.24s]  and something that is a lot different.
[11277.26s -> 11280.54s]  And I'll be really honest, I was a little concerned.
[11281.34s -> 11283.58s]  Because I just don't want, you know, obviously people to think,
[11285.47s -> 11287.23s]  like, oh, here comes the first sponsored stream.
[11287.23s -> 11287.79s]  It's over.
[11288.67s -> 11290.43s]  I'm going to get these every fucking day.
[11290.43s -> 11294.59s]  And not only that, it's going to be, oh, it's going to be egregious.
[11294.59s -> 11297.87s]  Oh, he's going to be, he's going to keep, she's going to shill so much bullshit.
[11298.91s -> 11301.55s]  I hope I can prove to you that that's not the case.
[11313.79s -> 11317.79s]  But there are plenty of companies and plenty of games and plenty of things that I would
[11317.79s -> 11319.55s]  probably do and I'd be interested in.
[11319.55s -> 11320.19s]  And this was one of them.
[11320.19s -> 11323.52s]  So sponsors are cool.
[11323.52s -> 11325.28s]  We know you're not a money grabber.
[11325.92s -> 11327.98s]  Oh, I can turn this off.
[11335.66s -> 11336.14s]  Sell out.
[11336.30s -> 11337.42s]  What is, what is going on?
[11337.42s -> 11340.94s]  Somebody said, what is, what is Joel doing?
[11341.58s -> 11342.46s]  Bill's doing something.
[11342.46s -> 11343.90s]  What's Joel doing?
[11344.62s -> 11349.76s]  Yeah, well, go to Joel.
[11350.48s -> 11352.08s]  They're doing a charity thing.
[11352.64s -> 11361.92s]  Is it still going on right now?
[11361.92s -> 11362.56s]  Yeah, let's go.
[11363.20s -> 11375.40s]  You're a businessman.
[11376.20s -> 11378.73s]  Oh, if that were the case, I would, I mean, if I was an executive,
[11378.73s -> 11381.05s]  I would have a fucking big smoothie and a huge ring.
[11381.93s -> 11389.77s]  God, that was so much fun.
[11390.49s -> 11392.59s]  I'm so glad that that was fun.
[11393.31s -> 11395.53s]  All right, let's go, Ray Joel.
[11396.41s -> 11396.97s]  Thanks again.
[11396.97s -> 11399.13s]  If you stuck around, I know we went late.
[11399.13s -> 11399.93s]  I know we started late.
[11399.93s -> 11402.17s]  I know a lot of people, they just, you know,
[11402.33s -> 11404.81s]  it's hard to stay up past like 10, 11 o'clock.
[11405.45s -> 11406.57s]  For those of you that stuck around,
[11407.13s -> 11408.49s]  I hope it didn't mess your sleep schedule up.
[11408.49s -> 11410.49s]  And thanks for watching and maybe we'll see you again.
[11411.13s -> 11412.89s]  If you got some time, maybe we'll see you Monday.
[11413.69s -> 11415.95s]  Good night.
[11416.51s -> 11418.36s]  Have a good sleep.
[11419.00s -> 11420.41s]  Call your mother.
[11420.41s -> 11423.02s]  We'll see you later.
[11428.81s -> 11431.37s]  Take care of yourselves and goodbye.
