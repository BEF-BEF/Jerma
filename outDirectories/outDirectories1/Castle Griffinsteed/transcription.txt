[0.18s -> 21.54s]  Today is a very special day. Every 25 years, the barbarian village of Elvenwood celebrates what they call the Warrior's Harvest.
[21.54s -> 34.04s]  A fruitful, wonderful celebration of honor, where the finest soldier in the village is chosen to venture out far away from camp and potentially to never return.
[34.04s -> 47.48s]  I am that man, and I will accept the task to find out what happened to my old family's house, Castle Griffinsteed, long since abandoned and corrupted by dark magic.
[47.48s -> 58.78s]  I must find out what happened. I must uncover the secrets of my old family name, for I am Carl Griffinsteed, and my adventure begins.
[58.78s -> 70.20s]  I give my final farewells and loom towards the path near the castle. There she stands, nearly 200 feet from our encampment.
[70.20s -> 78.87s]  I see to my left there could be a broken down caravan, but I leave it. There may be a scary animal inside, and I don't want to deal with that.
[78.87s -> 90.98s]  So as I move forward down the path, I think to myself, there's potential for bandits. The castle has been seized many times by many different forces, and my suspicions are correct.
[90.98s -> 98.89s]  Bandits are waiting for me at an outpost, and we will see who will die today. It will not be me.
[98.89s -> 105.13s]  I ready my sword, and I charge forward, or I wait, I wait for them to charge. They charge forward, and I take my swing with my blade.
[105.13s -> 113.61s]  I knock one of them down, and their blades have no effect on me because they are just idiots, and almost totally unscaled.
[113.61s -> 122.79s]  I walk away from this encounter. What war will lie ahead? What treachery? What deceit will lie ahead of me in Castle Griffinsteed?
[122.79s -> 131.46s]  When I stand right now, no man has stood, no man enters, no man returns. When you step in, you are there forever.
[131.46s -> 144.26s]  So I hear from my old grandmother's stories, and here we go. A castle in ruin, once great, standing tall, is now a former fraction of what it used to be.
[144.26s -> 152.45s]  But this is not the test. The test is the catacombs below. That was a checkpoint. The test is the catacombs below.
[152.45s -> 159.82s]  One can only imagine the secrets and the horrible dungeons that lie ahead of me, but I will press on.
[159.82s -> 168.56s]  I must find out what happened to my house, and I will bring back news to the tribe. A dead end, a choice.
[168.56s -> 176.73s]  One can go left, or one could possibly go right. Oh, coins. Coins, I need these. Cool.
[176.73s -> 186.65s]  And what is this? What is going on in my father's dungeon? Are those? No, it can't be. Wizards! Evil wizards!
[186.65s -> 192.65s]  I must dispose of them. They might be conjuring up some type of demon underneath my family's house. There's too many of them.
[192.65s -> 197.65s]  I'm being overwhelmed. I need to find it. Oh, give me that shotgun. That works. Shoot him with the shotgun.
[197.65s -> 206.65s]  I must cleanse them all. No dark, black magic must be performed under here, and there could be hundreds, if not thousands of them.
[206.65s -> 213.83s]  And the final one is dead. Hopefully, I have stopped their ritual. My stomach is full of all kinds of fluid.
[213.83s -> 220.26s]  I'm getting sick to my stomach, very nervous. There's only one way to go, and it's straight on.
[220.26s -> 226.32s]  Through my old family's prisons. You can tell it's a prison because, look, there's bars on the wall.
[226.32s -> 234.42s]  Through the corridor, into the next room, where there are coins. All right. Okay, well, we got our supplies here, too.
[234.42s -> 242.70s]  Got a couple of healing potions. What's that, an Uzi? I'm going to take the Uzi. A magnum and a flail.
[242.70s -> 246.65s]  I don't want to use this. We're going to go with the, uh, we're going to go with the Uzi.
[246.65s -> 252.89s]  I think that's the best for this current situation, considering it shoots the most bullets. Nothing in there.
[252.89s -> 260.04s]  Let's keep going on. See what we find upstairs in the dungeon. It's the military. I should have known.
[260.04s -> 265.04s]  The secrets. They must want to sell them to some private industrial man. Not in my watch.
[265.04s -> 270.78s]  You're not going to take me. I'll get pretty shocking out here. Pick these coins, too. It's all about the coins, guys.
[270.78s -> 274.78s]  Got to get as many coins as you can, so then people know how high your score is.
[274.78s -> 281.45s]  What? Okay. They must be at least one. We're going to go with the more finesse weapon. Magnum.
[281.45s -> 286.88s]  There's one down. Yep, I know that. I can see him. He was peeking over. He thought he was sneaky. He's not sneaky.
[286.88s -> 292.18s]  I'll show you sneaky. That's a one-two. One-two, baby. That's a rocket.
[292.18s -> 295.36s]  Get rid of this guy. Don't let him shoot another one.
[295.36s -> 302.54s]  I should probably take this. You never know when you're going to need a rocket launcher, my old grandmother used to say.
[302.54s -> 309.35s]  So, on to the cave system. Seems to have been dug out rather recently.
[309.35s -> 314.83s]  The fresh smell of dirt is... I can't go downstairs. I may have put these in wrong.
[314.83s -> 320.20s]  But the mold and mildew caking the walls, and the slight crackling underneath my feet...
[320.20s -> 327.87s]  It's one of the lesser demons! That is Algorro, the third lieutenant of the underworld!
[327.87s -> 330.87s]  I don't stand a warrior's chance!
[332.30s -> 342.73s]  That was really easy. Okay. I think we may have won. We may have beaten Castle Griffithsteed.
[342.73s -> 347.90s]  I would assume that there's nothing left. That must have been the source of all the power, so let's make our exit.
[347.90s -> 355.50s]  What the fuck is this? This is underneath Castle Griffithsteed?
[355.50s -> 363.92s]  A whole land of strange things. Creatures and wildlife and vegetation I've never seen before.
[363.92s -> 371.79s]  A harmless creature, it seems. But I must keep my wits about me if I'm to uncover the demonic presence.
[371.79s -> 381.46s]  Underneath my old family's house. What's in here? Having lunch, I see. Creepy.
[381.46s -> 386.43s]  We're going to continue on. Another place, another building. What is in this one?
[386.43s -> 391.70s]  Oh, a shop. Oh, cool. I told you guys I was going to need those coins.
[391.70s -> 397.11s]  Okay, so we're going to get... I'll take some potions from you, good sir. Your radar gun.
[397.11s -> 403.37s]  I'm going to switch to the shotgun. Okay, it's time to go. I'm going to go now.
[403.37s -> 407.37s]  I don't really want to be here anymore. You guys are seriously creeping me out.
[407.37s -> 412.61s]  We're going to leave. One more door to check, just for good measure, you know. We're going to open it up.
[415.96s -> 420.96s]  Get away from me! Get away from me, you vile creatures! You're not going to catch me!
[420.96s -> 423.96s]  Get me out of here! I don't even want to be here anymore!
[423.96s -> 430.20s]  Laser beams! How dare you shoot at me! I gotta go. Time to run. It's time to get out of here.
[434.06s -> 439.24s]  Another dungeon! It never ends! What else could I find under here?
[439.24s -> 443.24s]  I thought I killed with demonic presence. But of course not, it's a zombie game now!
[443.24s -> 449.24s]  Don't you know every game has to have zombies in 2015? What the hell is going on there?
[449.24s -> 454.24s]  Alright, I can't be much further away from the final secret. I wonder...
[454.24s -> 459.24s]  What is that? I just saw a hand. That must be Algulu! The giant demon!
[459.24s -> 463.24s]  Stuck in the wall for all eternity! I've only heard stories about this! I must hide!
[463.24s -> 468.24s]  Look at all these creatures! What the fuck was that? Oh my god, a barrel exploded!
[468.24s -> 471.24s]  There's exploding barrels! There's bunnies! Laser beams everywhere!
[471.24s -> 475.24s]  I've got to be careful. Aim down sights, just like in Call of Duty.
[475.24s -> 478.24s]  I remember my grandmother taught me that secret of aim down sights.
[478.24s -> 481.24s]  She would be so proud of me if she knew I was using it now.
[481.24s -> 485.24s]  Must clear the rest. A few more soldiers. A few more zombies.
[485.24s -> 491.24s]  What's that I hear? Oh no! He's getting ready to cast a giant spell! I must stop him!
[491.24s -> 496.54s]  I must have fucked up his health, because he wasn't supposed to die like that.
[496.54s -> 499.54s]  But that's it! The zombies are no longer pursuing.
[499.54s -> 506.66s]  Have I made it to the final room? The final door? Will I uncover the secrets of my family name?
[506.66s -> 511.49s]  What is in here? Who is this?
[511.49s -> 517.49s]  Welcome, Carl. It is I, your great times eighteen great grandfather.
[517.49s -> 524.49s]  I can teach you all the secrets, for you are the only person to ever make it through the dungeon.
[524.49s -> 532.49s]  So your choice is this. Come with me, or take this at least two months supply of chips.
[532.49s -> 537.35s]  The choice is yours. I stand you will make the correct one.
[537.35s -> 542.85s]  What do you want to know about your father? What about your grand...
[542.85s -> 548.31s]  I kinda want the chips. That's a lot of chips.
