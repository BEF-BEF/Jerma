[0.89s -> 13.77s]  Hi guys, how are you? Good to see you again. My name is Germo. I'm here to present a stream for
[13.77s -> 19.30s]  you all today. A little late today, but that's because we had a couple of different small
[19.30s -> 25.14s]  issues and by small I mean major issues. Issue number one, earlier about like an hour and a half
[25.14s -> 30.42s]  ago my internet was off. It was shutting off and turning on, shutting off, turning on. I'm like,
[30.42s -> 35.86s]  what the heck's going on here? So I had to figure that out. Issue number two, we're going to play
[35.86s -> 44.18s]  when I say we, Star is here. He's muted though. You can't hear him. Star and I were going to play
[44.18s -> 48.70s]  executive assault 2. And wow, that sounds like a fun idea. Let's go ahead and do that. Let's jump
[48.70s -> 56.22s]  into multiplayer and executive assault 1. The CEO game with the first person RTS. The game crashed
[56.22s -> 60.30s]  every time we tried to do it. We would get into a multiplayer game. We would try to figure it out.
[60.30s -> 68.46s]  Crash, crash, crash. So after it happening a few times, we were just like, uh, let's do something
[68.46s -> 74.74s]  else. And that's something else is viscera cleanup detail. Star has never played it. So we're going
[74.74s -> 84.47s]  to have to teach him how to play it. And here they are now. Oh yeah. We're talking about how
[84.47s -> 88.79s]  we're going to have to teach you how to play viscera cleanup detail. Yeah. He's never played
[88.79s -> 93.43s]  this before. I've never worked a day in my life that my hands are on callus that I've never even
[93.43s -> 101.56s]  held a mop before. I need to teach you how to use a mop. He says that's true though. Have you worked
[101.56s -> 113.93s]  a job? That's not true. I've mopped before for work. Yes. I have. Okay. All right. Okay. I
[113.93s -> 117.37s]  thought that you were just, I thought you didn't have one of those. I thought, okay, I didn't know
[117.37s -> 123.29s]  you have one. Okay. You just thought I was lying to you. I guess, I guess you had a job before.
[123.93s -> 131.21s]  I guess, I guess you've had to do like nightly detail work before. Yeah. So do I, do you still
[131.21s -> 134.81s]  need to explain this to me? I can't. Okay. When was the last, I'm curious. When was the last time
[134.81s -> 143.78s]  you held a mop in your hands? Um, it might've been eight years ago. Really? Yeah. I don't know.
[143.78s -> 150.55s]  A long, maybe like six actually. I don't know if that's true. I'm talking, you don't have to do
[150.55s -> 155.83s]  any cleaning, but when was the last time you held a mop in both of your hands? Yeah, like probably
[155.83s -> 162.07s]  six years ago. Okay. For me, for me, it was like two weeks ago. So, okay. I think I have some
[162.07s -> 168.15s]  authority to teach you how to play. And I think I'm, I think I just went to zero. No, thank God.
[168.15s -> 175.27s]  I hear your voice. It's going to be a struggle today. It's going to be a struggle today, guys,
[175.27s -> 184.60s]  but we're going to, I, I'm going for it. It's going to be a struggle. All right. Uh, so more
[184.60s -> 188.12s]  importantly, let's, let's just get in the game because we're already in the game. We already
[188.12s -> 193.91s]  spent the time getting into the game. I'm trying to touch your face and I can't. Hold on a second
[193.91s -> 204.81s]  here. There is that star. This is me. I'm on this side. You're, you're purple. Yeah. I'm lagging
[204.81s -> 213.64s]  right now. Yeah. I think, uh, my, my graphics up too high. That's what it is. All right. So
[214.20s -> 221.22s]  let's talk. What do you know about, um, cleaning? Uh, you, you dip the mop in the thing
[222.34s -> 225.94s]  and then you mop the stuff. Okay. Wrong. First of all, you have to clean up your area.
[226.90s -> 230.58s]  So these boxes here, you come over. I remember he's never played this game.
[231.38s -> 236.94s]  So hold left click. Oh, you don't have to hold it. You just click it. If you want to tilt it around
[237.50s -> 241.90s]  you hold left click and move it around in a circle. Your mouse, right? You can tilt it around this
[241.90s -> 247.26s]  way. If you press, uh, what button is it that you press to make it so it stands up right?
[247.26s -> 252.54s]  It is not T. Uh, what is it? How do I make it just stand up right? What's the button? Oh yeah,
[252.54s -> 263.34s]  this is the guy teaching me. I don't know what the button is. What's the button? F. No, no,
[263.34s -> 270.06s]  people saying F cause the internet queue. It's not cute. Double click, double art. So what you're
[270.06s -> 272.62s]  going to do is you're going to double, if you pick something up, you're going to double click
[272.62s -> 277.26s]  if you want it to stand up right, right click, drop stuff. Everything is physics based by the way.
[277.26s -> 285.08s]  So be aware of that when you're cleaning. So we need to, these are the boxes that you have to put
[285.08s -> 293.35s]  the trash in. And when I say trash, follow me up the stairs. Watch out for that. So in here,
[294.15s -> 300.04s]  as we open this door, you're going to see, well, this looks pretty clean. This is actually a clean
[300.04s -> 303.72s]  house. I did not think this is going to be clean. Um, over here on the, okay, nevermind. So over here
[303.72s -> 310.44s]  on the left, you see that there's been a couple of murders. Okay. And we need to pick up the whole,
[310.44s -> 318.12s]  the whole entire house has to be clean before we clock out. I have an idea. You have to listen,
[318.12s -> 323.64s]  no, you don't get ideas. This is my job. Okay. The rest of the house looks pretty good. So what
[323.64s -> 330.84s]  if we just wallpapered over the rest of this and just that room was back there. You want to just
[330.84s -> 335.37s]  build a wall here. Yeah. But then what happens to the, this part of the house?
[336.33s -> 340.73s]  This just can't go in this part of the house anymore. Oh, we can like clean the front porch
[340.73s -> 348.36s]  because once we sell it, we're good. Yeah. But they're going to want to see the kitchen and
[348.36s -> 355.00s]  shit. How are you going to convince them to do? Yes. You're understanding. So we have to just wait.
[356.14s -> 359.18s]  I wasn't done explaining. So we have to clean up everything. We have to rearrange everything.
[359.66s -> 368.23s]  It has to be spotless. There is an incinerator somewhere. I have no idea where. Okay. Is the
[368.23s -> 372.55s]  meat grinder part of the cleaning or is that the horror? I don't, uh, have I ever seen this before?
[375.64s -> 381.78s]  Okay. I think, I think that works. Oh, I can't pick you up. That's too bad. Hey, there's no
[381.78s -> 385.22s]  incinerator on this level. So we have to put, you have to pick up the things and throw them in there.
[386.02s -> 392.70s]  Okay. What are we putting in that original bucket? Okay. So come over here.
[393.80s -> 397.56s]  As you can see, this is the slosh romantic. This is a machine. And when you press the button,
[397.56s -> 401.16s]  it comes out with a fresh bucket of water. Where are you? I'm right behind you.
[403.32s -> 408.68s]  Grab the bucket of water. Don't spill it. I get made fun of for that. It is very easily spillable.
[408.68s -> 420.22s]  You're going to take your, I couldn't do it. How did you know? Really? Okay. Well,
[420.22s -> 426.07s]  just be careful with these. You very easily spillable. Very easy. I don't know why it was
[426.07s -> 431.51s]  not spillable. Uh, so you need to take this and obviously bring it. Let's start over here.
[431.51s -> 438.26s]  Get a couple of my own. Yeah. Get your own bucket. Take out your mop. Now your mop can only be used
[438.26s -> 442.66s]  a certain amount of time. So you take a look down here, see how that's doing that. It's cleaning it
[442.66s -> 447.62s]  up. Your mind is going to get dirty. Watch your footprints. Don't walk through stuff.
[449.61s -> 454.17s]  And once it becomes too dirty, if you keep mopping, you're going to make a fucking mess.
[454.17s -> 460.12s]  Don't do that. Come over to your water and dash it, dash it like that. Clean it up. And then you
[460.12s -> 467.16s]  get to use it a little bit more. By the way, when you get to a point where you've done this a few
[467.16s -> 473.56s]  times, the water is going to get dirty and you're going to have to dispose of that bucket because
[473.56s -> 480.04s]  you can't use it anymore. Let me just grind this person up. Hold on. This is my first day on the
[480.04s -> 489.38s]  job. Thanks for training me. So you're going to pick that up with your hands and then clean it.
[490.02s -> 493.54s]  No, no, no, no. Well, now you've ruined that bucket. So you've already screwed it up. See how
[493.54s -> 498.57s]  the bucket's ruined now? Okay. So now your head's clean. Let's just put this in here.
[500.46s -> 506.25s]  Okay. So once there's a big mess over here, you start to clean it up.
[506.25s -> 509.53s]  All right. So do you have a basic understanding of how we're doing this?
[510.17s -> 511.77s]  Yeah. I'm tracking blood everywhere.
[511.77s -> 515.43s]  Yeah. So you stop doing that job. And by the way, this is happy Halloween, everybody.
[515.43s -> 519.59s]  Happy Halloween. I don't know why we started. We thought we would do something festive for a
[519.59s -> 525.45s]  change. Yeah. Let me just tell you something right now. This map is supposed to take four hours.
[525.53s -> 534.74s]  Oh, estimated. So it's like, is this like a gamer equivalent of doing like a thousand piece puzzle?
[534.74s -> 543.13s]  Yeah. Except you don't have to really think where the pieces go. You just, I mean, I guess.
[543.13s -> 549.53s]  Oh, by the way, get these USB drives. Hold on to them. Why? Because they give you extra points
[549.53s -> 555.37s]  at the end. You put them in the computer. Okay. Okay. So we have to wait. I need a designated
[555.37s -> 560.25s]  area. Think of a desert because we don't want to lose these. So designated area for these are going
[560.33s -> 565.26s]  to be over here. Yeah. Just drop them like right here. If you find a green USB drive.
[565.26s -> 569.10s]  All right. Well, I need a bucket of water. Where's that bucket of water? There it is.
[569.10s -> 573.91s]  I'm going to bring this upstairs. So do you want to work together or do you want to change rooms?
[574.79s -> 582.84s]  Um, I don't know. This is going to fall. I think we could probably do different rooms.
[582.84s -> 589.27s]  You said you wanted to, uh, said you wanted to embarrass me and show me how much better you
[589.27s -> 593.61s]  were at cleaning. Yeah. I mean, I could, we could do, if you want to pick a room and we could, um,
[593.61s -> 602.30s]  we just do it in the neighbor's yard. Yeah. Oh, I'm just realizing. So the next people have to
[602.30s -> 609.74s]  clean up the next house. Okay. So come over here. Let's, we have to pick equal rooms.
[609.74s -> 614.90s]  Let's go upstairs. We have, they have to be equal. Is there an upstairs? How do we get upstairs?
[614.90s -> 635.30s]  Is there an upstairs? It looks like there is. This is a closet. Okay. Is your room clean? I think
[636.74s -> 643.46s]  it's pretty clean. Oops. Oops. Oops. Hey rookie, come in here for a second.
[646.41s -> 651.37s]  Open the door. Open the door. You open the door. I'm doing a joke. You have to open the door. No,
[651.37s -> 661.46s]  you open the door. Hey rookie. Oh, your bucket. You're fucking this up for me. All right. No,
[661.46s -> 666.50s]  wait, how do you get upstairs? I was going to make like the Hey rookie thing where I hold the glass
[666.50s -> 671.54s]  and drop it in front of you and it breaks and I walk out of the room. Where's the upstairs?
[671.54s -> 688.46s]  How do we get upstairs? There's a basement. This basement. Why is there no light down here?
[688.46s -> 696.14s]  There's a USB. Yeah, grab it. How do we turn the lights on? Is there no upstairs? How's this
[696.14s -> 700.73s]  thing going to take four hours? This is going to take like 20 minutes. How long have we been
[700.73s -> 710.74s]  down? Oh, oh, candles. This is how we get light. Come over here. All right. Let's, let's go down.
[710.74s -> 718.44s]  We're going to work together. We're going to go. What the fuck was that? Yeah. Grab a candle. We're
[718.44s -> 723.78s]  going to start in the basement. We don't need to do, we can do that later. While we work together,
[723.78s -> 727.46s]  this is going to take like 40 minutes. Not even. Grab a candle from the vending machine.
[729.26s -> 736.71s]  Where? Out here. Why do we need candles? Because it's dark. It's not that dark. It's very dark.
[738.04s -> 754.34s]  Vend out a candle. What is that? What does it say? Do you need light? Let me help you.
[755.86s -> 762.50s]  Read it out loud. Turning hardwood into soft pulp. Power. Pure diesel. Fueled wood.
[763.62s -> 769.06s]  Rending power. Tired of hauling branches, logs, and tires, and even bodies for miles just to get
[769.06s -> 775.22s]  rid of them? Well, that ends now. What you need is the ultimate tool. Chuck Torrance's diesel
[775.22s -> 780.26s]  deforester. Is this just an advertisement for the thing in the back? All right. We'll
[780.26s -> 785.38s]  vend another candle. That's, hey, that's dirt. That's dirt. That's trash. Get rid of that.
[785.94s -> 790.76s]  I can only do one thing at a time. We're going to bring, hold on. Where's the,
[791.72s -> 801.75s]  it's too dark. Okay. Any trash has to go in here and then this has to be ground up.
[804.28s -> 809.08s]  That's not, why did you put the candle in there? Because it's not dark. I can see very clearly.
[810.25s -> 825.61s]  Turn your gamma up, kid. Do I turn my gamma up? How do I turn up my gamma? All right. I turn the
[825.61s -> 831.22s]  gamma up a little. It looks better. Oh, I can see now. All right. Okay. Now, now we skipped a whole
[831.22s -> 836.60s]  step. Now it'll be 30 minutes. All right. Well, let's, where's the meat grinder? Are these
[836.60s -> 842.39s]  pumping in the back? Okay. So take this. We don't need a candle anymore. All right. Take the,
[842.95s -> 846.92s]  just follow me down to the basement. We're getting paid to do this.
[849.72s -> 852.44s]  There's the stairs. All right. No, no, no. Upstairs, upstairs, upstairs, pronto.
[854.15s -> 864.68s]  Making it worse. No, upstairs. Oh, okay. Stairs. There are stairs. All right. So I'm going to,
[864.68s -> 872.97s]  I'll take, there are a couple of rooms up here. Get out of my way. Get out of my face.
[873.61s -> 878.71s]  Holy shit. This is going to take a long time. Oh no.
[887.10s -> 897.00s]  All right. We'll throw him away. We have to go from the edge of the house out.
[899.16s -> 908.44s]  Oh man. This is bad. This is fucking horrible. I found some belongings. All right. We need,
[908.44s -> 911.16s]  we need to do this right. I need, where's the thing that pushes out the, um,
[911.88s -> 917.03s]  why is this room so perfect? No, it's like fucked up. This one's like fucked up.
[917.03s -> 924.46s]  All right. So come here. Where are you? All right. So we're going to pick rooms. So I,
[924.46s -> 931.42s]  you take this one. Where are you? I'm right here. So you take this room here.
[932.30s -> 939.58s]  This one here with the bed. Okay. Oh my God. Yeah. It's pretty bad. Okay. So you take that one.
[939.58s -> 944.14s]  This one's really bad up here too. I'll take this one. And then let me see. I want to see
[944.22s -> 951.02s]  where to compare. You can look at this one. Oh, this is, oh, this is so, oh yeah.
[951.74s -> 957.70s]  This is pretty bad. Let me just walk around real fast. You didn't even go in the closet either.
[958.34s -> 965.42s]  That's an attic. No, no, you know, you know, you know, I, I don't want you to examine my shit.
[965.42s -> 971.59s]  Come here. You, you, you pick, pick a door and then whatever you get, you get. Come down here.
[971.59s -> 975.34s]  I'm, you know, I picked this one. I'm going to do this one. I don't know. I have no idea
[975.34s -> 979.02s]  what the fuck's behind that. I don't know. So. Okay. I'm going to do this one. You can do that one.
[979.66s -> 987.40s]  Yeah. No, it has to be an actual room. You want to do this one? I don't know what's behind this one.
[987.40s -> 992.68s]  So I'm going to just. Oh, okay. Just fine. We've been spending 10 minutes. I'll pick this room.
[992.68s -> 998.10s]  Just take that room. I'm going to take this one. Uh, maybe let's, you gotta grab buckets and shit.
[998.10s -> 1011.96s]  So come here. Okay. What did you put in here? Oh Jesus. All right. You need to have like at
[1011.96s -> 1015.40s]  least two or three buckets as a technique. Now where's the thing that Prince fights?
[1018.18s -> 1023.50s]  There it is. Okay. On the left side of the house, there's a device. What the fuck am I breaking?
[1024.06s -> 1029.67s]  All right. So there's a, on the left side of the house, when you come out,
[1030.23s -> 1035.53s]  where'd you go? Come out of the house and you need to see this. It's important to know.
[1036.17s -> 1046.12s]  Yeah, I'm coming. Are you coming? What are you doing? Wait, wait, where are you? Wait, wait,
[1046.12s -> 1052.18s]  hold on. I'm being assaulted. Come out with the back of the front. How many minutes has it been?
[1052.66s -> 1062.15s]  It's been six. Just go out the front door. You need to see this. I'm coming. All right. So
[1063.21s -> 1069.61s]  over here, this green stand up display box thing, you click it and it gives you one of these.
[1069.61s -> 1075.61s]  It's so much easier just to clean a room by putting shit in here first and then taking that out
[1075.61s -> 1082.57s]  and putting it outside and disposing of it later. Okay. So what I like to do is I like to grab
[1082.65s -> 1089.37s]  two or three stack them up on top of each other and bring like two into wherever you're cleaning.
[1089.37s -> 1099.02s]  You feel what I'm saying? Okay. Yeah. Oh, by the way, holding down shift is walk. It's your best
[1099.02s -> 1119.61s]  friend. Okay. So we're going to go clean those two rooms. Yes. I, I, I, yeah, yeah. What was
[1119.61s -> 1129.66s]  that Flintstones thing? Oh no, no, I know what that is. Stack. Where are the stairs?
[1130.62s -> 1147.94s]  Where are the stairs? Are you serious? I don't remember right here. All right. I got that. Now
[1147.94s -> 1156.79s]  you're going to want some buckets. There's already, there's already been a fucking mess.
[1157.75s -> 1163.59s]  The buckets count as trash too though. Stack them and get rid of them. I recommend stacking them
[1163.59s -> 1168.07s]  one by one into each other and grabbing the bottom bucket. You can also do that when they
[1168.07s -> 1173.94s]  have liquid in them, but you have to be careful. I'd like to do at least four or five. Do you really
[1173.94s -> 1183.96s]  like to do this? What are you talking about? I'm talking about like you have some free time.
[1183.96s -> 1204.31s]  You just like hanging out and cleaning. Yeah. Yeah. What? Yeah. Stop. You're doing a great job.
[1206.06s -> 1212.46s]  Just do it. Oh no, I'm good. Oh, by the way, be careful because sometimes it might,
[1212.46s -> 1228.41s]  you might get a troll. Spill. You get your own. You have your own room to do upstairs. So get
[1228.41s -> 1236.57s]  your own. No, bring more than one. He's an idiot. He's an idiot. I'm the idiot. He's an idiot. He
[1236.57s -> 1240.95s]  doesn't understand. You're on like your fourth spill. Oh, I wonder why that is. Maybe it's
[1240.95s -> 1245.11s]  because somebody keeps taking them and throwing them into the trash behind me. I only need one.
[1245.91s -> 1266.73s]  He's an idiot. He doesn't even know. Where is he? I don't like how quiet it is. I can
[1266.73s -> 1273.37s]  hear him like walking around. Are you starting? I guess. Okay. Just wait. We have to do a three,
[1273.37s -> 1280.57s]  two, one countdown. I almost just dropped all this. Okay. Stop. Why is it doing that?
[1281.21s -> 1288.54s]  Why is it doing that? Guys, why is it doing that? Is this too big to go in the door?
[1290.06s -> 1304.55s]  The hell? Oh, fuck. Okay. Why are you leaving doors open? That's your issue.
[1305.51s -> 1311.83s]  There's blood all over every wall. Why are the doors open? You're going to get a draft.
[1311.83s -> 1315.75s]  You gave me like a Nickelodeon guts staircase to go up, by the way. Thank you.
[1318.79s -> 1326.07s]  Can you move that chair, please? Can you move this stuff for me, please? Oh, my mouth.
[1326.87s -> 1331.43s]  Not funny. No, time out. Time out. Time out my mouth. Time out. I'm bleeding. I'm moving. I'm
[1331.43s -> 1341.62s]  moving. I'm good. It was funny until you fuck. I got to go to the hospital, dude. Did you move
[1341.62s -> 1349.08s]  everything? Yeah. It's just. Oh, my fucking God. Take the one on top, please. Just take the one out
[1349.08s -> 1358.44s]  of the top. Thanks. Server reaching net actor saturation. Uh oh. What does that mean? We're
[1358.44s -> 1368.78s]  about to be over saturated. Server reaching over saturated levels. All right. Are you ready
[1368.86s -> 1376.68s]  to start cleaning? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's see whose methods better. Okay. So on the count of
[1391.99s -> 1403.16s]  on the count of three. Uh, what? Hold on. Let me. I'm not ready to count yet. This is oversaturated.
[1404.70s -> 1416.41s]  Okay. On the count of get out of here. You've done enough. Okay. Are you counting? I'm not
[1416.41s -> 1420.09s]  ready to count yet. Hold on. You're cleaning already. I'm not cleaning yet. I promise. Look
[1420.09s -> 1428.33s]  at this room. Okay. Ready? No, I'm not giving you another viewer. Okay. One, one, two, start
[1428.33s -> 1443.78s]  cleaning. Okay. Got any music? What? No, I have to play that. Yeah. Isn't there a radio in the
[1443.78s -> 1454.63s]  game? There is a radio in the game, but it's it doesn't really work that well. Oh, are you
[1454.63s -> 1460.15s]  allowed to listen to music? Uh, maybe. Am I? Does your mommy say you could? Did you take my?
[1461.11s -> 1485.42s]  Take your what? Nothing. What the fuck was that? Is that you doing that? Or is that the game
[1485.42s -> 1490.22s]  doing that? That's the horror mansion doing that. Is that the horror mansion? Yeah.
[1491.18s -> 1521.78s]  Fuck. Too many actors. Can you, can you clean up some of these actors, please? I'm doing,
[1521.78s -> 1557.61s]  I'm doing it. You okay? I'm going to be okay. Dastardly. I'm sorry. Did you not use that word?
[1557.61s -> 1568.01s]  I just said dastardly. I'm sorry. Having a fun time. I wish I had the candle in here and it's
[1568.01s -> 1581.99s]  too dark. It really is. Are you serious? I just need can. I'd like the candle. How are you doing?
[1581.99s -> 1589.26s]  You doing okay? Yeah. How are you like halfway? Yeah, I'm getting there. I think maybe I should
[1589.26s -> 1616.12s]  have got more buckets. I told you I'm trying to get this as clean as possible. Clean, clean, clean.
[1617.18s -> 1623.42s]  Now remember, it what it matters is to be valid. Your room has to be completely empty
[1623.42s -> 1629.26s]  of no like trash cans. No, but if this stuff like belongs there, like there's books and stuff.
[1629.26s -> 1633.58s]  I mean, the books are fine, but no like trash and no buckets and no enough. Yeah, it has to
[1633.58s -> 1641.11s]  be out of the room completely clean room. Okay. And we'll have we'll have some like a chat
[1641.11s -> 1668.33s]  inspection. I'm not in a game. No. All right. Well, you you try to host this time. Damn it.
[1673.99s -> 1679.37s]  Hold on. I put in so much work. I did too. You don't know how much work I put in.
[1679.93s -> 1689.48s]  God damn it. Okay, hold on. I'm setting up the host. Maybe I can actually do it this time.
[1690.20s -> 1697.29s]  Oh, wait, I'm in like the normal game now. It like kicked me to the normal game. Oh, you got
[1697.29s -> 1704.54s]  on the normal game. Oh, my God. Do I have your stream restarted? It was playing on my stream.
[1704.54s -> 1710.76s]  It was wait, what? Forget about just don't even talk to me. All right, I'm gonna go like this.
[1713.50s -> 1719.77s]  And I'm gonna go like this. And it's gonna be really fun in like another 20 minutes when I go
[1719.77s -> 1728.70s]  to zero again. Okay. Well, I'm hosting it. I'm in the game. Wait, frick. Hold on. I'm not hosting it.
[1729.26s -> 1735.98s]  I closed the game. This is too hard. Cleaning was easy. Cleaning was easy. This is hard.
[1735.98s -> 1745.90s]  I'm going to zero again, I think. No, why? Why? If you can't clean it, just call it off.
[1745.90s -> 1758.98s]  No, I can't call it off. Just admit that I win. We can move on. I'm not going to admit.
[1758.98s -> 1763.85s]  We can reschedule. We can do something else. All right, let's try one more time.
[1763.85s -> 1783.93s]  Okay. All right, you got a game? Okay, hold on. I'm fuming right now. Oh, I just like I'm fuming
[1783.93s -> 1792.41s]  right now. Okay, I'm in. I think I invite you. I don't do I don't know. I've never used a computer
[1792.41s -> 1808.94s]  before. The mic still on. I know I'm live right now. We'll try it again. We'll see what happens.
[1809.88s -> 1816.76s]  Oh, yeah. Well, now we both know how this works. You know, it's fair.
[1816.76s -> 1818.44s]  It's hilarious because you want to know something?
[1825.10s -> 1832.63s]  I just got murdered. Why? I was going to say something funny. Not funny, actually. The funny
[1832.63s -> 1841.75s]  thing is they did a hardware node upgrade. They did like hardware maintenance, like upgraded the
[1841.75s -> 1849.48s]  node as worse than ever before. Holy shit. What are what are you saying? Holy shit. Like fucking
[1849.48s -> 1860.50s]  the Internet's stupid. Okay. Anyways, you got a game? I'm coming. Yeah. Let's see if this works.
[1861.43s -> 1865.21s]  See if I can stay connected for more than a minute. Oh, did you put the password in the
[1865.93s -> 1877.10s]  in our in our DM here? It's the same one from the other game. We tried to play another game
[1877.10s -> 1883.88s]  before this and my computer like restart it. And then it crashed to desktop the second time.
[1884.68s -> 1891.62s]  So so far, you know, playing games with Jerma, a lot of fun. It's going pretty good. It is fun,
[1891.62s -> 1905.32s]  isn't it? God. All right. Hey, okay. So what would you look? Okay, so here's how you play.
[1905.32s -> 1912.82s]  It's funny. Here's what you do. Go over here. Shut up. And there's you pick it up, you press
[1912.82s -> 1918.70s]  you can rotate it. What does this thing do? It tells it's a smell machine. It tells you what
[1918.70s -> 1925.13s]  when you turn it on, and you point it around. It'll tell you specifically what direction is
[1925.13s -> 1931.45s]  still trash. You can change the you can change the mode. If you right click one of them is blood
[1931.45s -> 1938.20s]  and body parts. The other one is trash. And it kind of beeps the closer you get. Okay.
[1938.20s -> 1942.60s]  That's great news. Yeah, it is. You are not going to get that same room again, because
[1943.56s -> 1957.66s]  we both know it was already. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know. It was it was fun. So how about
[1957.66s -> 1964.74s]  how about you get the room that I had with the bed? And I'll do the basement. You think you can do
[1964.74s -> 1971.86s]  that? Yeah. I'll just do you one higher. I'll do the living room. I'll do the whole living room.
[1971.86s -> 1975.62s]  This would be completely completely spotless. I think the other room was worse because it's
[1975.62s -> 1985.45s]  upstairs and you got to walk all the way up there. Is that not fair? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You get my
[1985.45s -> 1989.69s]  old room. I get basement. You're the one that had like the bed with the blood in the Freddy Krueger
[1989.69s -> 1999.30s]  hand. Yeah. All right. You got it. Get situated. Get ready. Okay. And I'm not going to like close
[1999.30s -> 2012.58s]  the game when I'm embarrassed about my room or anything. Okay. And I'm only doing the
[2013.62s -> 2017.38s]  there's like two rooms down here. I'm only doing the actual basement. Why did that cause more?
[2018.39s -> 2024.47s]  Not this like no just do the actual basement. I'll do your old room. I'm loading in more stuff.
[2026.30s -> 2031.11s]  Okay. I know what room is yours. I'm going to get some stuff situated and we can go
[2031.19s -> 2046.76s]  up. Get this back over here. Making a lot of noise up there. Yeah. Cause I'm moving around.
[2046.76s -> 2064.54s]  I'm trying to get situated so I can start this cleaning job. Okay. Where? What the fuck? Good
[2064.54s -> 2070.44s]  call. Nice. Nice call. Not a bad idea. I just ran around. I walked around the whole house
[2071.69s -> 2088.70s]  to get this. I'm only going to do two. No, I can do three. I know I can do three. I've done like,
[2089.66s -> 2094.78s]  I've done like five before. I can't even fit two through the front door.
[2095.90s -> 2115.58s]  Let's go. I can't do two. No, I can't apparently. Why are you leaving doors closed in this house?
[2115.58s -> 2124.73s]  We're doing a job. What? Why am I leaving doors closed before it was open? And it was
[2124.73s -> 2132.89s]  irritating. What am I? What's going on? Am I stuck on something? I was just walking on the table.
[2133.61s -> 2147.35s]  That makes no sense. Okay. I'm about ready to get going here. This is the room right here.
[2147.35s -> 2152.47s]  I thought we started. No, that's fine. You can go ahead. No, that's fine. You're that confident.
[2152.47s -> 2163.32s]  I'm pretty confident. I am. What the fuck was that? I'm confident. I am. All right. Here we go.
[2174.94s -> 2185.78s]  Jipple sandwich. Why are you doing that? I don't know. Did you almost get crushed?
[2186.42s -> 2190.18s]  I don't know. I was just thinking about Jipple sandwiches. We're kind of in a house of horrors.
[2191.14s -> 2210.26s]  Why am I even doing this? This can just stay in here. Remember, no trace of any liquid.
[2210.82s -> 2216.02s]  Everything has to be perfect. Not even water? I mean, no, no, no, no, no water. The room has
[2216.02s -> 2235.99s]  to be done. Okay. You're something of an expert. How many rooms have you cleaned? Let's get that
[2235.99s -> 2241.03s]  straight. Ever? Yeah, because you're about to be beat by like a one-time room cleaner. I mean,
[2241.59s -> 2250.46s]  I've cleaned a lot of rooms before. It depends. How many? I mean, we all know you haven't picked
[2250.46s -> 2255.02s]  up a mop in like four years, as you said, five years, something like that. Very respectful.
[2256.71s -> 2269.88s]  That's not a bad number. All right. I'm getting, I'm doing pretty well. How are you doing over
[2269.88s -> 2274.28s]  there? Things looking good? Very good. Very good. Good, good, good, good. I like to hear that.
[2275.24s -> 2284.94s]  I like to hear the competition is, you know, not just a one-sided thing, right? Yeah. It's
[2284.94s -> 2291.88s]  nice to see that the server is like stable now. Yeah. I wonder why it was having problems before.
[2292.84s -> 2300.52s]  I don't know. I'm just going to make my own internet. Yeah. Maybe I was saying before,
[2300.52s -> 2307.69s]  maybe you should like move to like Vegas to fix your internet. Everything sucks. Don't you know?
[2310.49s -> 2322.17s]  Everything sucks. Oh, we're getting the actor. We're getting the oversaturated actors thing again.
[2325.96s -> 2339.90s]  Who's an actor? I don't know what that means. Nice spill. Did you hear it? I heard you say
[2339.90s -> 2344.46s]  fuck and I heard a bucket. I haven't spilled once yet. This game is easy.
[2347.02s -> 2383.64s]  I need another bucket up here. Do you need any help? No. What? Why? I'm just trying to move
[2383.64s -> 2389.62s]  some stuff in that house. It sounds like you're having trouble. Like I could bring you a bucket.
[2392.25s -> 2395.93s]  No, that's good. Do you need a bucket? I could bring you something if you need.
[2396.73s -> 2399.85s]  No, I'm good. All right. Good. Just trying to help each other out here.
[2401.88s -> 2404.92s]  United friendly competition. We just we help each other out.
[2405.72s -> 2413.29s]  You know, do you need something? I don't need anything. I'm good. God damn it. Let me get out
[2413.29s -> 2419.61s]  here. I just need to dispose of these buckets that I have in my hand and then go this way.
[2421.61s -> 2436.17s]  Cool. I need like two more buckets. I think maybe. Why do I always go this wrong way?
[2440.95s -> 2443.59s]  Two buckets will do it and then I've got a little bit more time.
[2444.31s -> 2453.03s]  Come on. Do two. He's getting ahead of me. Come on. Hurry up.
[2456.68s -> 2459.24s]  Do you know the speedrun strategy so you can like be hop and everything?
[2460.28s -> 2468.12s]  I have my own strategy. You do yours. Are you trying to lock those out? Illegal move.
[2468.12s -> 2472.12s]  Illegal move. Illegal move. How is this illegal? You didn't set any rules. Illegal.
[2472.84s -> 2487.82s]  Are you still behind me? I needed that bucket too. That's an illegal move.
[2488.62s -> 2494.57s]  If you win, you're disqualified. I don't see any rules written anywhere.
[2494.57s -> 2498.09s]  There was a verbal agreement that you were going to be nice today.
[2501.06s -> 2519.35s]  Jeremiah, I'll be nice today. How you come? Almost done. Really?
[2519.99s -> 2533.16s]  Yeah, it's actually isn't that bad. Fucking illegal move. It was bullshit. It really was.
[2535.30s -> 2540.50s]  Oh, if I lose, it's because of that one bucket. Yeah, because I needed that. I would be almost
[2540.50s -> 2547.59s]  done by now. Can we get a ref? Anyone? Anyone want to be the ref here?
[2549.51s -> 2564.02s]  Anyone see that? I just like rubber banded. Oh, lag. Lag. I was going to win by lag.
[2565.75s -> 2572.38s]  That was an actual illegal move. Yeah. You don't need to mean it. I don't need to tell you that.
[2572.38s -> 2616.49s]  Oh my god. Okay. Watch that. Watch it. Okay. Give yourself a percentage. What percentage
[2616.49s -> 2625.19s]  you think you are? Like 80. 80. Yeah, I'm probably around 70. I got a way to go, I think.
[2626.07s -> 2636.90s]  Don't get too confident, though. I hear comebacks are very common in the
[2640.73s -> 2649.99s]  high level of competition. Yeah, I would say I'm like 65% probably.
[2653.00s -> 2656.20s]  Going backwards. I think I may have gone backwards a little.
[2657.00s -> 2687.99s]  Do you know the background for this house? Like, is this?
[2690.42s -> 2694.84s]  It's like a Freddy and Jason or something. Something like that.
[2695.56s -> 2699.64s]  On the classic Indian burial ground. There's some empty graves down here.
[2702.92s -> 2715.11s]  Cool. I like graves or something. I'm focusing. I'm focusing. I'm focusing.
[2716.90s -> 2751.48s]  I'm way behind you. So I need to focus. I'm probably at like, I'm getting there.
[2771.26s -> 2780.44s]  Fuck. I'm done. Done. I said it first. I said it first. I definitely said it first. I said it
[2780.44s -> 2789.91s]  first. I said it first. No, you didn't. You didn't say it. You did not say shit. I said done and then
[2789.91s -> 2797.37s]  you said done. How about we based on whose room is cleaner? I bet you have a spot somewhere like
[2797.37s -> 2806.58s]  you left something. No, I'll let it slide. Okay. Let me come see your room. All right. Don't track
[2806.58s -> 2825.11s]  shit up here. True. Okay. Hold on. Let me walk outside and clean my boots. Hold on. I'm getting
[2825.11s -> 2856.18s]  clean. I think I'm clean. Okay. Inspection. Oh, what's that chair? I see a knocked over chair
[2856.18s -> 2860.02s]  behind you. I just bumped into it because I was scared that you came in here. It was like this.
[2861.38s -> 2868.18s]  Jack took a screenshot. No, you startled me. It's not right. No, I'm sorry. If an inspector
[2868.18s -> 2873.67s]  walks in a room and goes, the person's going to go, what the fuck, and turn. That's what you did.
[2873.67s -> 2884.34s]  Okay. I'll let it pass. That's good. Everything's fine. I have to deduct a point for the chairs.
[2884.34s -> 2888.82s]  What is this chair? Where is it facing? It's not like a desk. It's just in the middle of the room,
[2888.82s -> 2899.27s]  a chair. What's wrong with that? You guys just leave chairs around your room? Yeah. Is everyone
[2899.27s -> 2904.39s]  okay with there just being random chairs? Where would you put this chair? There's no where to sit.
[2904.39s -> 2909.11s]  There's no place for that chair to be. It shouldn't be in here. What if I want somebody
[2909.11s -> 2914.31s]  to come in and help me? Maybe if you turned them and you at least pretended that this was a desk.
[2914.31s -> 2918.79s]  Automatically assuming that there's no small baby in this house, that the mother would have
[2918.79s -> 2925.26s]  to sit here and nurse. What are you talking about? You need the chair for that. Yeah,
[2925.26s -> 2930.60s]  you need to sit in a chair for that. I don't know. I wouldn't put a baby on a chair like that.
[2930.76s -> 2936.87s]  You need a rocking chair. The mother sits in the chair with the baby in her arms.
[2936.87s -> 2944.63s]  What are you talking about? I don't know. Fine. Deduct a point. I'll take that. Okay.
[2948.82s -> 2963.51s]  You can't open these? No, you can't open those. What the fuck was that noise? That was scary.
[2964.79s -> 2973.19s]  I got spooked. Nothing. It's nice and clean. All right. You got a 99. Nice. Thank you. Okay.
[2977.42s -> 2991.70s]  99. One point off. That's cool. Wait. Wait. I just got a tip. What do you mean a tip? Okay.
[2993.06s -> 2996.74s]  If you're the inspector, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a minute here. If you're the inspector,
[2996.74s -> 3000.66s]  do you have to call other inspectors to do your job for you? That was you just did.
[3000.66s -> 3005.06s]  You just inspect photographs and then you get the final review is from chat we said.
[3005.86s -> 3009.86s]  So I'm taking their input. I know you don't read yours. I read mine a lot
[3010.66s -> 3017.54s]  and I take their input all the time and I'm very nice to them consistently. I would love it if
[3017.54s -> 3021.38s]  from yesterday's stream if anybody could pull up some data on how many times my eyes looked over
[3021.38s -> 3025.46s]  at the left monitor. Now that's chat and it was probably four or five hundred times.
[3025.46s -> 3030.98s]  Is chats on the right? Chat is on the left actually. Nope. Excuse me. I've seen it. Okay.
[3030.98s -> 3034.82s]  How would I pick up? How would I pick up the one guy? That person's coming to get you.
[3034.82s -> 3039.78s]  That was weird. That freaked me out. Never mind. You're bringing an axe. Yeah. Because the person
[3039.78s -> 3047.42s]  who has the least score has to get their head chopped. This is a horror game. Inspectors first.
[3047.42s -> 3054.78s]  Okay. Let me clean my feet. Let me rub my feet. Let me. Wow. Entry way is a little bit of a. Nope.
[3055.58s -> 3063.83s]  Hey, not judging based on the entry. Wow. Well, first of all, this is not the basement. This is
[3064.31s -> 3069.19s]  the. Okay. Whoa. Whoa. I don't know about this.
[3082.10s -> 3093.80s]  You idiot. Well, thanks for concentrating. You're next. That's the joke. You're one of them now.
[3094.60s -> 3105.53s]  I win. Oh, oh, oh, I got me. Well, here's the funny thing. I have a confession to make.
[3106.25s -> 3116.33s]  Yeah. I won. That's a confession. Confession. I won. All right. I threw everything out the window.
[3120.39s -> 3126.47s]  Oh, so you cheated. So did you. So you're disqualified and I. You cheated too.
[3127.27s -> 3132.78s]  How did I cheat? Look, come over here. My. Wait, did I cheat though? Or did I just move?
[3137.83s -> 3144.20s]  Wait, did that? No, that didn't come out of here. We both cheated. We both were wrong,
[3144.20s -> 3149.96s]  but I was. I was very deliberate. But your room is not clean. Who's room is cleaner?
[3150.52s -> 3156.98s]  I think the precedent first is who cheated. Like if you're caught using, you know, what,
[3156.98s -> 3161.62s]  what were they using the cork baths or, you know, way back in the day when they're hitting slammers.
[3161.62s -> 3166.34s]  You're old enough. You remember, right? So I threw stuff out my window, but cleaned the room.
[3166.34s -> 3174.15s]  You made the room way worse. Who's room is cleaner? You deflated the football. You lose.
[3176.39s -> 3179.03s]  Uh, what about, what about the illegal move where you knocked the shit out of my hands?
[3180.31s -> 3187.35s]  That wasn't illegal. How is that? No, my room was cleaner and I could have just like kept that lie
[3187.35s -> 3190.87s]  up and you would have just been so disappointed. I can't believe you did this though, but thanks
[3190.87s -> 3198.44s]  for putting everything in the right spot for us to clean. All right. We're going to work together.
[3199.56s -> 3205.00s]  We're still doing this. What do you mean we're still doing this? I would love to see you actually
[3205.00s -> 3210.50s]  clean the basement disaster zone now. You're just going to watch. Show me how it's done.
[3213.69s -> 3219.82s]  You're just going to watch me do this. Well, okay. Let's, let's do it together. Nice catch.
[3220.54s -> 3233.29s]  All right. So that's not the basement. Hey rookie, catch this. Oh, no. Open the door.
[3234.94s -> 3241.62s]  Open the door, please. My lip, my lip, my mouth, my mouth. Look at my mouth. Is it bad? It's bone.
[3242.02s -> 3246.58s]  Oh, fuck. No, no, no, no, no, no. I got, I got it. I got it.
[3249.22s -> 3265.83s]  Is it better? Let me see. No, it's bad. You're beeping. All right. Let's go. Okay. Where do you
[3265.83s -> 3269.59s]  start? I don't know. What's the method? You have to just grind the people. You have to grind them.
[3271.86s -> 3282.71s]  That's not the method. Um, all right. Where's the back door? There's no back door down here.
[3282.71s -> 3286.74s]  Oh God. All right. Well, we got to bring them all up the stairs.
[3286.74s -> 3289.38s]  Wait, is there, there's a cut. There's a thing you can cut. Where's the cutter?
[3290.92s -> 3297.96s]  A cutter? Yeah. There's a cutter. There's secret tools. Is that another point deduction? You didn't
[3297.96s -> 3307.72s]  tell me about the secret tool. No, no, no, no, no. Can I, can we cut? There's this, there are secret
[3307.72s -> 3314.70s]  tools, but I don't know if they're in here. I can't believe you did this. This is like so bad.
[3314.70s -> 3320.54s]  All right. Just start grabbing people. Just grab people. Okay. People first. People try to get two
[3320.54s -> 3332.41s]  people in one of these. What about respecting the dead? Um, says the guy that piled them all up down
[3332.41s -> 3340.09s]  here. Now get your own bucket. You said try and get two in here. I got two. We're working together.
[3340.09s -> 3352.39s]  Are you picking this up or am I picking this up? You should take that. Okay. I'm gone. Here. How
[3352.39s -> 3363.69s]  about I pass the bodies up the stairs? Just throw them up the stairs. Where's the grinder?
[3365.56s -> 3371.96s]  Backyard. This guy doesn't even know where the grinder is. Yeah. Nice clean room you had there.
[3372.94s -> 3380.23s]  All right. This is not, this is not doing so well. I think they're still alive. Are you sure? Are you
[3380.23s -> 3386.39s]  sure you killed them? Are you sure you killed these people? I am sure they're dead. We're missing
[3386.39s -> 3408.60s]  somebody. That person's gone. Wait, there's more down here. Oh dude, dude, dude. What? Dude, there's
[3408.60s -> 3415.24s]  another house. There's another house? There's another house. Where? Oh, there's a back path.
[3415.88s -> 3423.18s]  Four hours, by the way. Oh dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,
[3423.18s -> 3429.37s]  dude. I can't believe it dude. Yeah, there's definitely a back entrance though. I mean,
[3429.37s -> 3436.97s]  you go around the back. Yes, they do. Dude, I don't see a back door. I guess there's no back door,
[3436.97s -> 3446.38s]  but why? I found the one true ring. The one true ring. To rule them all. The Lord of the Rings.
[3446.38s -> 3454.26s]  Okay. What about it? Do you like that movie? You've never seen that movie. It's literally, it's.
[3455.56s -> 3463.42s]  What? You've never seen Lord of the Rings. Stand still. Drop the body. Look forward.
[3465.34s -> 3475.22s]  Just pick a direction. Just stop. Just pick a direction. I'm stopped. Don't touch my ring.
[3475.22s -> 3483.64s]  Oh, it actually is the ring. All right, we're gonna do a bit of golf impression. Uh, wins the
[3483.64s -> 3500.74s]  contest. Okay, uh, go. Go, your turn. Go, go, go. Did you just throw out the ring?
[3502.10s -> 3507.54s]  Yeah, that's a, that's a fucking whole series then. Oh, okay. I'll hold the box because you can't.
[3514.89s -> 3530.68s]  Spoilers. Spoilers. Spoilers. Just bring them. Still. Spoilers. The Lord of the Rings. Spoilers.
[3531.56s -> 3538.74s]  What happens if we destroy this? I have the ring in my hand. What happens? Destroy it. What,
[3538.74s -> 3542.98s]  is this how you kill Sauron? Don't you have to drop it off Mountain Dune? Like this probably
[3542.98s -> 3554.02s]  can't do it. Yes, Mount Dune. Mountain Dune. Dune's a good series. You can't even get it in. Here,
[3554.10s -> 3568.15s]  let me show you how it's done. There you go. World still stands. All right, keep, keep it going.
[3568.71s -> 3574.15s]  Go get the rest of them. I lined up the bodies. I did my part. Hey, where are you going?
[3581.05s -> 3593.54s]  Get this out of the way. Well, you did bring them in a nice concentrated zone. Yeah. Jesus.
[3594.26s -> 3602.47s]  That was horrible. It's really like, it went right in there. How far away were you?
[3603.51s -> 3611.58s]  Right behind you. It's like a glove. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't throw this one in.
[3611.58s -> 3617.11s]  Okay. New competition. New competition. Okay. Let's see how far away you can stand and get the
[3617.11s -> 3625.74s]  body in. Oh God. Um, okay. Did you just get it in? No, I'm right here now. Well, I'm waiting. You
[3625.74s -> 3636.89s]  first. Okay. Now I get a throw. We trade off throw. Okay. That was the equivalent of a boxing match.
[3636.89s -> 3640.25s]  You just like punched me once in the face and I fell flat down and just took a fall.
[3640.89s -> 3648.20s]  Okay. See, I didn't get mine. Now you, now you go again. How about not farthest, but
[3648.76s -> 3652.44s]  the stairs are the limit. You can't walk in front of the stairs. All right. Stairs are the limit.
[3652.44s -> 3657.91s]  That sounds good. Is it, is there a way to, um, what is it like a way to put momentum behind it?
[3660.18s -> 3668.50s]  I don't know. No, I can't like golf them in there. All right. I'm going to try. Here we go.
[3672.54s -> 3675.98s]  It looks so silly. Try to get like full momentum. Okay. Move, move, move.
[3676.70s -> 3681.99s]  We show you how it's done. Holy shit. That was close. That was pretty good.
[3688.71s -> 3697.46s]  Wait, wait. Somebody says you can hold left click, hold left click and shake the mouse.
[3704.92s -> 3714.22s]  Oh, it's just to rotate them. Uh, I lost mine. What? How did he go backwards?
[3720.36s -> 3726.86s]  Are you trying to, you didn't even dunk it. Oh, you don't think I can dunk it. Wait, wait, wait,
[3726.86s -> 3750.50s]  wait, wait. I'm just going to place them in. I lost them. Did you just die? Oh shit. I guess I win.
[3751.80s -> 3766.31s]  I'm back. I respond. Yes, you can die in visceral cleanup detail. All right. You dunk.
[3767.51s -> 3782.94s]  How are you doing that? I'm going to get it. Somewhere in the future. Someone's going to pull
[3782.94s -> 3786.70s]  up this video and they're going to be like, what the fuck was wrong with people?
[3789.22s -> 3793.70s]  Why are they stimulating, like throwing each other like dead bodies into a grinder?
[3794.87s -> 3807.50s]  What were they doing this for? Come on. It looks like,
[3808.06s -> 3811.34s]  oh, it looks like you're doing like a magical spell.
[3825.58s -> 3831.58s]  Thank you for just standing by and watching too. Cause like you could stop this.
[3831.58s -> 3841.24s]  I could, but will I know if I could stand a little closer? No, you have to get it from here.
[3847.08s -> 3850.44s]  Whoa. I don't, I, it's hard to see where I'm throwing it. Cause I'm not looking where I'm
[3850.44s -> 3872.34s]  throwing. You're standing closer. How are you doing that? You're going like, you're doing like
[3872.34s -> 3879.66s]  swing up, down, up, down. Yeah. Look up. Yeah. Look up. Cause you need to get some height on it.
[3880.46s -> 3887.40s]  And at the end, when you, when you pull it forward, you got to, you got to right click them.
[3891.16s -> 3894.44s]  It's really hard to get height. It is really hard to get the height on it.
[3899.00s -> 3903.00s]  Please hurry up and do this. So my fucking great grandkids don't, you got it. You got it.
[3904.36s -> 3908.20s]  You did it. You actually did it. I was going to say, because I'm like great grandkids don't
[3908.20s -> 3913.85s]  think I'm like a fucking psycho. Did you see me? Did you watch me or were you like looking at the
[3913.85s -> 3919.05s]  stars? No, I saw it. It was great. I just spun my mouse around in circles and like, oh, like I
[3919.05s -> 3935.80s]  totally gave up. All right. Let's do it. Let's do it. Alley-oop. Ready? Yeah. All right. Let's look
[3935.80s -> 3965.42s]  back to the basement. Four hours, by the way. Go one at a time. You're still doing like the
[3965.50s -> 3970.38s]  magician trick. All right. I gotta, I gotta like try. I gotta make the job fun somehow.
[3971.93s -> 3979.51s]  Well, that was weird. Oh, you, if you do it too fast, you just drop them. All right. And wait,
[3979.51s -> 3990.41s]  is that all the bodies? What am I doing? Why did you do this? Oh, that was a clean throw.
[3990.41s -> 4006.79s]  This is classic star. You know, what's classic star. Where are you? We're not,
[4007.35s -> 4012.26s]  we're not working on the basement. I am in the basement. How is this still clean?
[4013.14s -> 4022.73s]  We gotta go inside out. Oh my God. Put this guy on a team inside. I don't miss anymore. Look,
[4022.73s -> 4026.81s]  I get that extra step forward. I don't miss. I don't, I don't know what that's a reference to,
[4026.81s -> 4033.02s]  but I may or may not have been funny. I don't know. It's not a reference. I'm doing so good.
[4033.02s -> 4037.02s]  I'm not missing my shot. That's not like a, like a CS go like pro didn't say that during a
[4037.02s -> 4040.62s]  competition or something. I don't, not that I'm aware of. So you did, you just made, you just said
[4040.62s -> 4053.70s]  that. Yeah. I got, I'm two in a row. Shouldn't we, shouldn't we be getting all this stuff out first?
[4054.42s -> 4058.54s]  Just when you get, when you have to just get the, you don't want to, you don't want to track stuff
[4058.54s -> 4064.44s]  everywhere. Or like we're going, like we're going to. No, but you're not. Oh my God. Look what you
[4064.44s -> 4073.98s]  did. Look what you fucking did. Look what you did. Stop throwing it. Look what you did. Um,
[4073.98s -> 4077.50s]  you don't even talk about my throwing. There's a skeleton in here.
[4078.30s -> 4090.81s]  All right, let's go. You really did. It's like too much stuff. Hey, hey, hey, do we get rid of the
[4090.81s -> 4097.83s]  boxes or we just reshelf? No, we gotta get, no, that's not the strategy. What? This is where they
[4097.83s -> 4106.52s]  were. I'm going to get two more buckets and I'm going to go get like, there's one already here.
[4106.52s -> 4117.34s]  Nice. But this one's dirty. So get rid of it. Whether you like it or not, as long as my internet
[4117.34s -> 4125.66s]  stays on. I know what it is. You can't reach the top shelf. Is that some kind of joke? Is that,
[4126.54s -> 4135.18s]  is that, I don't understand. Is that like a, like what do you mean? What do you mean? Like I,
[4135.82s -> 4141.66s]  you would rather take the boxes out of here, like all the way up the stairs for each individual box
[4141.66s -> 4148.54s]  and admit that you can't reach the top shelf. But you, you can't reach the top shelf. No, I. What?
[4148.54s -> 4153.58s]  Like you can't reach the top shelf, right? That's what you're saying. No, I'm saying you can't,
[4153.58s -> 4160.68s]  like I can't, but you can't either. I totally can. So if I came over there right now and we both
[4160.68s -> 4166.55s]  tried to grab the top shelf, you, I wouldn't deal with it. No, put a box up on the top shelf.
[4167.19s -> 4177.85s]  I don't think you're putting it down when I'm picking up here. I don't. But I'm, I'm very,
[4177.93s -> 4180.65s]  I'm a huge, I'm, they actually call me massive man now.
[4182.09s -> 4190.97s]  Massive man? Yeah. M.M. for short. That's my new thing. Why are you massive man? I just like,
[4190.97s -> 4202.63s]  I just heard like a. Yeah. Well, the outside's going pretty well because I'm doing some work.
[4202.63s -> 4208.54s]  I'm working on it. Remember where we're going to put the collective? Why is there only, oh yeah,
[4208.54s -> 4221.93s]  because my internet turned off. Remember what? Remember to put the USBs outside the door,
[4221.93s -> 4227.00s]  the front door to the right. That's that way we get our bonus. Yes, there is a bonus.
[4227.72s -> 4233.66s]  And then there's a nice clean house you can feel, you can feel proud of. Okay. And then you like
[4233.66s -> 4240.68s]  take a screenshot. Yes. Put it on Insta. Sure. Wherever you want to put it. Don't matter where.
[4242.04s -> 4258.12s]  Look mom clean. Wherever, whatever social media you'd like to put it on. Oh, what the? I broke
[4258.12s -> 4267.18s]  it. I can't, I broke the box. Do I have to, do I have to get on the roof? I'm going to check out
[4267.18s -> 4273.24s]  the roof. I broke it. I can't wait to be on that. What do you mean you broke it? I can't,
[4273.24s -> 4289.30s]  the box is stuck. Well, we can delete it. Hey, hey, what are you talking about? What?
[4291.94s -> 4297.78s]  I sincerely hope you're not getting into any shenanigans. I know I'm trying to get on the
[4297.78s -> 4303.06s]  roof, but I can't. We're cleaning the basement. Why are you trying to get on the roof? I'm outside
[4303.06s -> 4310.42s]  doing the outside. Cause look, no, every time we agreed to both do the basement. Look, the email
[4310.42s -> 4317.70s]  that I got clearly stated you two need to work on the project together. And wherever you feel most
[4317.70s -> 4323.46s]  comfortable being at this here, when we're at the cleaning job is where you can go. I hear when
[4323.46s -> 4328.74s]  we're at the cleaning job. No, you said I see, we were both going to do the basement and we were
[4328.74s -> 4332.66s]  going to help each other. I did say that, but I'm still going to do that. But I, I'm going to,
[4332.66s -> 4335.86s]  I am going to rub a corpse all along the roof if you don't get down here.
[4341.40s -> 4347.98s]  That'll go in the email that I write. So do whatever you think is necessary to do in a
[4347.98s -> 4364.79s]  professional manner. I'll come help you. Basement. That's where I'm going. Just get, please move out
[4364.79s -> 4372.65s]  of the way, please. I'm fine. Grab that top one. Grab the top one and be gentle. Very gentle there.
[4372.65s -> 4378.46s]  I don't know how you did that. What did you do? What did you do? Why did you do that? Why did you
[4378.46s -> 4386.34s]  do that? How can you possibly say that? You took it out. You, you took it out. You must have done
[4386.34s -> 4397.29s]  something. You had to have done something. Look at this. What are you doing? Well, I'm not. Oh,
[4399.74s -> 4405.91s]  oh, it's because we deleted the ring. These are ring wraiths. I don't know what you're talking
[4405.91s -> 4411.11s]  about. You just, there's no, you don't even know anything. Just grab a bucket and meet me downstairs.
[4411.11s -> 4423.37s]  You know nothing. You fucked this up so bad down here. It's not, I don't think it's even
[4423.37s -> 4429.05s]  possible to do this. How is it not possible? Okay, here's your job. You want to send like a
[4429.05s -> 4437.29s]  message to HR? Fine. Go just bring buckets down here and go get like, just keep bringing them down.
[4438.09s -> 4444.28s]  Okay, I'll bring one down, take something out. Talk about cans of peas, all the random vegetables,
[4444.28s -> 4457.96s]  get them into the trash can and then incinerate them. You can reach the top shelf down there.
[4458.60s -> 4473.30s]  Hold on. Okay, he's in. Uh, didn't put water in this one. There, there were a couple that I
[4473.30s -> 4487.66s]  brought down from before. Fuck this bucket stacking. It's a waste of everyone's time.
[4487.66s -> 4502.76s]  Dirty water. Okay, put those. All right, we're gonna have to take the box, the boxes up like
[4502.76s -> 4507.96s]  one by one, I think. I'm put, I'm shelving them. You're, you're putting these on the shelves?
[4508.92s -> 4528.01s]  Yeah. Oh, you're standing on a bucket to do it. Cute. You didn't even clean up here. You didn't
[4528.01s -> 4532.01s]  even clean up here though, dude. Like, come on. What do you, what? You can clean after you put
[4532.01s -> 4536.65s]  the boxes there. You can put, you can't, you're gonna knock the boxes off. What do you mean?
[4540.65s -> 4546.89s]  You're gonna clean under the boxes after the boxes are up there. I'm sure you can. Oh man,
[4548.98s -> 4551.38s]  I don't think I can work like this. I don't think I can.
[4552.50s -> 4555.62s]  Holy fuck, I just jumped over everything. I'm good. That would have been very bad.
[4556.66s -> 4571.70s]  All right, can we at least take care of the entryway? Can you bring a candle down here too?
[4572.76s -> 4575.40s]  Are you, I just heard a spill. That wasn't me.
[4587.74s -> 4595.16s]  What? What? You spilled the bucket and it wasn't me. So it's funny to me. What bucket? I heard
[4595.16s -> 4610.70s]  like a up here. That was me throwing out old buckets. I thought you were back in the fucking
[4610.70s -> 4636.89s]  basement. You made permanent marks on the wall. Permanent. Yeah, these are permanent marks.
[4636.89s -> 4656.38s]  Oh, maybe not. Just clean around. Slow. Easy. Bring, bring a candle down here.
[4656.70s -> 4664.65s]  Yeah, I know you can. They're right next to you. Okay, I'll do it. Thank you. I just, I want to
[4664.65s -> 4668.41s]  be able to, it's atmosphere. We're doing the Halloween map. You don't want to have atmosphere
[4668.41s -> 4681.72s]  here. There's a little, there's a little cache. Okay, I got it. I got it. What was that? What was
[4681.72s -> 4686.70s]  that? Focus on, focus on what's in front of you. What do you mean what's in front of me? Like do
[4686.70s -> 4690.38s]  your task. What's that noise? Worrying about everyone else is doing. I'm getting you the candle.
[4690.38s -> 4693.90s]  All right, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Take this. You're like, what's that? There was a chainsaw
[4693.90s -> 4697.66s]  sound. I thought you brought a chainsaw down. Take this. No, that was the creating a candle.
[4698.38s -> 4703.37s]  Oh, that, right? Like put it on the, yeah, no, no, no, I'm gonna have to clean there.
[4703.37s -> 4708.12s]  Take this up with you when you're out. Here, you put it where you want it. Yeah, I will. And then
[4708.12s -> 4711.08s]  just take this. This one's dirty. Let's get rid of that one. Throw it in the incinerator.
[4711.96s -> 4731.59s]  There we go. Thank you. That's, that's so much better. Why are you up here? I just wanted to
[4731.59s -> 4738.58s]  check. Check what? I just had to check on something. Not a big deal.
[4742.90s -> 4749.34s]  I'm gonna have something else for you to take. Why would we get grind these up? These are
[4749.34s -> 4755.90s]  perfectly good beans. All right, this is starting to do the thing where there's too many physics
[4755.90s -> 4759.90s]  objects in the thing at the same time. So you have to take this and get out of here with this.
[4759.90s -> 4767.86s]  Let me shake it up. Okay, okay. Drop it, drop, drop it. Hold on. Drop it. Easy.
[4767.86s -> 4775.69s]  Easy. Careful. It's going to do the physics thing. I'm, I'm well aware of the physics thing.
[4779.99s -> 4790.90s]  See, don't you, don't you think this is a cool game? Hello. It's great. It's great. It's great.
[4792.74s -> 4797.35s]  Don't, you don't, don't be sarcastic about it. It's fun. It's great. Just wait till we do another
[4797.35s -> 4809.59s]  one after this. Uh, which one's next? I'm already looking forward to it. Well, we bet you better
[4809.59s -> 4826.97s]  hurry up. We got work to do here. Oh, nice job. Back on the shelf. Nice job, like hiding the beans.
[4826.97s -> 4832.49s]  For yourself. What do you mean hiding the what? Put the box in front of the beans so no one knows
[4832.49s -> 4838.31s]  there's beans back there. There's a broken plate over here. Do you want another box? Is that what
[4838.31s -> 4843.34s]  you're saying? Stand over here for a second. Just stand over here. Get like in the light right,
[4843.34s -> 4861.18s]  right there. Right there. Oops. Sorry, I dropped it. Don't do it. Why did you, what, what, how did I
[4861.18s -> 4877.66s]  end up with this in my hand? What? Just, okay. Okay. I didn't do that. That was mean. That was
[4877.66s -> 4881.10s]  a mean thing that he did. Are you bringing some new, you're not bringing new buckets down.
[4883.19s -> 4889.78s]  These are still clean. The one you just dumped on me was full of blood. And now I have to take out
[4889.78s -> 4894.02s]  this box. There's two clean buckets right here. And now I gotta take this box out. Look what
[4894.02s -> 4902.98s]  you've done over here. And you're tracking mud all over the place. Thank God that candle's down here.
[4908.09s -> 4914.15s]  Did I just break the grinder? What? We need that. I heard like a, but that's fine. That's fine.
[4914.15s -> 4925.34s]  USB right here. All right. Look, come on. It's looking pretty good. It's not looking bad. Yep.
[4925.34s -> 4931.42s]  And this is almost one room done. Well, this room was like 10 rooms because you made it that way.
[4937.11s -> 4945.30s]  Anything in this? No. The only reason why this room is taking so long is because you put all
[4945.30s -> 4951.06s]  the trash from all the other rooms into one room. I, all those boxes were in that room already.
[4951.94s -> 4956.42s]  What about the 10 bodies? Where'd you get those? I got the bodies from a lot of places.
[4958.26s -> 4973.86s]  Are you calling those bodies trash? Respect the bodies. Thank you for the new water. No,
[4973.86s -> 4978.90s]  come here. Give me this candle. There we go. Now I can see better. And now here we go. Okay.
[4980.44s -> 4988.58s]  I consolidated the trash. Like that word. Consolidated. Yeah. I could, what is this?
[4989.30s -> 5000.74s]  Like a credit card payment? No, this is like almost cleaned up your whole mess.
[5001.38s -> 5024.09s]  That was a Jerry Seinfeld level joke. Seinfeld was a hilarious show. That's a very funny show.
[5024.09s -> 5031.72s]  So that's okay. That's like a nine out of 9.8 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes. Why would I be mad
[5031.72s -> 5038.89s]  about that? Yeah, it's like one of the best shows of all time. I mean, that's like saying like, oh,
[5038.89s -> 5043.05s]  man. Well, what you just did right there. Oh, that was like, that was like something God would do.
[5044.81s -> 5047.93s]  He's very comparable. Like, oh, well, yeah, I get it. Okay.
[5055.83s -> 5061.53s]  Isn't streaming much better with an audience? What are you talking about? Oh, like when you
[5061.53s -> 5066.41s]  hear Ashley laugh. It's like you can imagine you're streaming in front of an auditorium.
[5068.33s -> 5072.09s]  Well, there's like one person in this stand. There's one person in this stand.
[5072.09s -> 5084.39s]  But at least they showed up. I don't hear any laughs from your side. No, no, that person's not
[5084.39s -> 5089.19s]  here in the auditorium. You brought a cell phone in and put it on speakerphone and put it in the
[5089.19s -> 5101.94s]  chair. And they're watching the live video of my like stand up routine. Yeah. Critics are saying
[5101.94s -> 5113.83s]  as good as Seinfeld. Go get Otto. All right, this is almost full. I feel like I'm doing more than
[5113.83s -> 5118.63s]  you. You're not doing more than me. You have a live feed of my work that you can critique
[5118.63s -> 5124.66s]  anytime you want. I don't have like the multi stream. Who's watching both? Who's doing more?
[5124.66s -> 5129.59s]  Are you streaming? Yeah. I thought you had, I thought your stream was off. Why are we not in
[5129.59s -> 5144.52s]  squads? I don't know. I thought you, your stream wasn't on. What? Add me to a squad. Okay. What
[5144.52s -> 5155.13s]  the hell is going on here? I don't know you streaming. I know. Do you invite me? Hold on.
[5155.13s -> 5160.55s]  I'll invite you. No, I'll invite you. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Invite me. Invite me. Okay. Invite me.
[5161.64s -> 5166.71s]  Invited. All right there. I didn't know that was happening. I thought you had your stream turned
[5166.71s -> 5175.40s]  off. No, you weren't live when I turned it on. That never happened. I checked your stream.
[5177.46s -> 5182.73s]  We both started at the same time. Yeah. But did you turn your stream off after you played
[5182.73s -> 5193.91s]  Overwatch? Yeah. As I'm saying, all right. All right. You ready? I've got, I've got most
[5193.91s -> 5199.74s]  of the trash. Wow. You did a good job. You did. How satisfied do you feel? I'm not that satisfied
[5199.74s -> 5204.70s]  yet because there's still things that need to be done. Can't you just take a moment and like be
[5204.70s -> 5212.46s]  happy? We can after we get it all done. I've actually never seen you smile. You look at the
[5212.46s -> 5221.13s]  ceiling. We're not done. Do you need another bucket? I don't think I need another bucket.
[5221.13s -> 5235.00s]  Thank you for the consideration. How long has it been? Four hours? I think we're at like seven.
[5242.18s -> 5249.74s]  Okay. It's up. The basement is pretty much done. There's a little bit left on the floor,
[5249.74s -> 5254.94s]  on the wall a little bit. Oops. All right. He'll pick that up. What's up with this broom?
[5255.74s -> 5267.10s]  What's with the broom? Yo. What are you talking about? I found like a broom that I used like a
[5267.10s -> 5272.44s]  mop, but it's a broom. Oh, I don't know. I figure what that does. All right. I'm going to use the
[5272.44s -> 5279.64s]  candle. We're going to check. All right. Everything looks okay except for that. That's why I need the
[5279.64s -> 5285.42s]  light down here. Well, don't you have like the speedometer to check where the blood is? Yeah,
[5285.42s -> 5299.85s]  but I mean it's easier to just see it. Yeah. Don't you have this speedometer saved? Yeah,
[5299.85s -> 5305.34s]  that was a little that was just a little a little boop. We're fine. I don't mind the little the
[5305.42s -> 5317.48s]  little boobs. It's the your internet turns off to zero is the one I don't like. Okay.
[5318.94s -> 5322.86s]  We can you can use the little oh no no no no no this the the the red rum room.
[5324.22s -> 5328.54s]  There's a bathroom in here. There is a bathroom. Oh god. What did you do in here?
[5329.42s -> 5333.42s]  I was like that when I found it. It's actually not hard to clean, but unfortunately
[5334.46s -> 5342.62s]  I'm sorry to say we need another bucket down here. I'm sure you do. I'm going to bring one up.
[5343.18s -> 5347.58s]  I'll go get it. You just you keep doing anything. I'm bringing the bucket. Stay in the fucking
[5347.58s -> 5351.02s]  basement. Well, okay. I'm going to stay in the basement, but just don't there's a lot of blood
[5351.02s -> 5356.86s]  to track. So don't track it up here. I have two buckets that are full of gross stuff that I need
[5356.86s -> 5377.08s]  you to take. Clean your feet. Clean feet. Clean feet. I don't have. Yeah, there's an intestine
[5377.08s -> 5387.72s]  over here. Hold on. Okay. Take that. Is that yours? Yeah, it's mine. That's my intestine.
[5393.85s -> 5396.10s]  Ah, god damn it.
[5408.14s -> 5414.65s]  Did you spill? Do you still have the one of me complaining? I don't. People asked for it all day
[5414.65s -> 5418.17s]  and I forgot. You're gonna have to give me a new one and I'll have to remember.
[5419.77s -> 5423.45s]  Hey, hold on. I'll just bring it. I'll bring the second ear over here.
[5427.19s -> 5435.61s]  Watch those feet. I'm not moving. You're tracking stuff everywhere. I don't want to read that.
[5439.30s -> 5446.07s]  Hey, give me one. Give you what? You're gonna give me a line. When did I say I was gonna give
[5446.07s -> 5450.39s]  you a line? I thought you just said, okay, never mind. I'm crazy. Never mind. I said what happened
[5450.39s -> 5455.83s]  to the one you recorded? Yeah, I said I like didn't save it by accident and then you said,
[5455.83s -> 5466.87s]  hold on. I'll give you one and then. Did I do that? Yeah, then. I don't think I did that.
[5468.86s -> 5476.78s]  Did I say that? All right, well, turn it on. Okay. No, let's talk about the. Yeah, I've talked about
[5476.78s -> 5490.39s]  the ear. Yeah, I wasn't. I didn't say that. All right. You ready? Yeah. Hold on. Oh, yeah,
[5490.39s -> 5498.38s]  I was complaining about DPS, right? Okay. Hello. I can hear myself. Why can I hear myself? Hello.
[5501.91s -> 5512.76s]  Hello. Hello. God damn it. Why does it have to quit me out too?
[5513.16s -> 5525.40s]  Ah, that was a Charlie Brown yell. I know. Hello. Stop it. Stop it. It's not funny. I'm upset.
[5528.49s -> 5542.30s]  Stop it. It's not funny. I'm upset. Hello. What the fuck? We're never gonna be able to do a full
[5542.30s -> 5547.58s]  one of these. Hold on. Oh, yeah, I was complaining about DPS, right? Okay.
[5553.37s -> 5560.73s]  No. Hello. No. Why? Why? We can't get anything going. Hello.
[5567.34s -> 5576.30s]  What a sad day. Are you coming back? I mean, like the server's still up. What? It is? Yeah. Oh,
[5576.30s -> 5584.10s]  it is. Holy shit. Okay, cool. I'm coming in. How did you? You didn't get that? I thought that we
[5584.10s -> 5590.55s]  like I thought everything got disconnected. No, I'm fine. Because I'm hosting this one.
[5592.49s -> 5602.31s]  Oh, cool. Hello. I'm so fucking sad right now. Like, I might sound like, oh,
[5605.18s -> 5608.94s]  I'm so angry right now. This isn't it. You can't, you know, there's no consoling me.
[5609.66s -> 5618.60s]  Hello. Fucking angry right now. I'm so angry. I'm so angry. Hello. All right. So where were we?
[5619.56s -> 5623.48s]  Uh, we were cleaning the basement. Okay, we're cleaning the basement. Cool.
[5623.48s -> 5630.76s]  All right. So where were we? Hello. Stop. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. I can't.
[5631.56s -> 5637.40s]  I have too many emotions right now. I'm being stretched. I'm being stretched in two different
[5637.40s -> 5643.00s]  directions. We're almost done with the basement. You're gonna pull me in half. I have like anger
[5643.00s -> 5656.30s]  and upset and fucking rage. And then you're making me laugh. Hello. Are you in? I'm in. I'm in. I'm
[5656.30s -> 5661.83s]  in. I'm here. I'm here. I'm very angry, but I'm here. I'm very angry. I forget what door is the
[5661.83s -> 5675.93s]  basement door. That's how fucked up I am. Okay. The basement is clean. I think basements clean.
[5677.14s -> 5687.22s]  Yeah. Did I drop again? Uh, no, I, I know. All right. The bathroom is clean. The toilet is clean.
[5688.10s -> 5696.41s]  Oh, I broke the toilet, but it's okay. Oh, typical fucked up. I am. No, I know. It's fine.
[5696.41s -> 5701.88s]  I can close it clean, clean, clean, clean. All right. This is clean. That's clean. That's clean
[5701.88s -> 5716.12s]  over here. Clean this way. Oh, don't do it again. Don't do it again. It's going to do it again.
[5716.76s -> 5721.24s]  No, it's not. You're fine. Your streams up. Everyone's loving it. Everyone's loving this
[5721.24s -> 5723.96s]  content that you're providing. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. You really make me feel better. All right.
[5723.96s -> 5731.19s]  Let's go. Basement is clean. I'm so happy that you brought me along as backup streamer.
[5737.85s -> 5742.65s]  You're like the, you're like the never turn off the battery thing. Yeah. Whatever it is,
[5742.65s -> 5744.89s]  the thing you plug in to make sure your power doesn't turn off.
[5746.14s -> 5750.04s]  I'm the backup generator. Yes. What did I, what did I call it?
[5751.00s -> 5754.04s]  I'm the battery thing. I think you called it. The never turn off.
[5754.44s -> 5756.68s]  Whatever. The never turn off battery thing.
[5758.76s -> 5766.55s]  Okay. So I need, what's going on over here? Are you throwing more stuff out the window?
[5767.35s -> 5771.03s]  What? No, I'm, I'm finishing up the basement. There's a couple like empty bucks down here.
[5771.03s -> 5782.89s]  Okay. So this is, what's in here? This one can be done quickly. Yeah. I remember this was me.
[5782.89s -> 5791.98s]  Yeah. I'm going to clean up over here. Hello. Hello. Just get like 10 of them. You ready?
[5792.94s -> 5804.44s]  Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[5807.74s -> 5817.18s]  Hello. Ashley's ruining them. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[5817.58s -> 5824.86s]  Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[5825.82s -> 5836.87s]  Uh, that was just a Charlie Brown's yell. I know. That's a nice car. Can you stop goofing
[5836.87s -> 5843.62s]  around with your soundboard? Get this building clean. Oh, I'm doing the, uh, the garage. Hello.
[5848.70s -> 5857.58s]  Hello. It's going to be easier to demolish this building. Yeah. It would be way easier just to
[5858.22s -> 5882.01s]  do like a controlled demolition. What happened tonight? Did you see the car?
[5883.69s -> 5890.90s]  What car? There's a really cool car in here. Yeah. I saw it. I took a body from that room.
[5891.54s -> 5898.30s]  You left a body in that room too though. Oh, well see I was having a hard time running around
[5898.30s -> 5901.74s]  and grabbing bodies and also making sure you didn't see me grab all them.
[5903.82s -> 5909.88s]  But little did I know you never left the room. No, I did not walk out of the room. I didn't really
[5909.88s -> 5918.36s]  hear you walking around. I was wondering what was going on. Scheme. I had a scheme going.
[5919.37s -> 5940.98s]  How fucked up I am. That was so angry. I am so bad right now. Scheme. I think we're done.
[5940.98s -> 5950.30s]  We are not done. Do you know how much is left in here? I think we're done. We are not done. Pull
[5950.30s -> 5958.70s]  out your little ecto gun thing and see where it is. It says all clear on it. Oh, hold on. I'm
[5958.70s -> 5964.17s]  getting a phone call. Hello. Hello. This is the boss man. They're calling it in. We're done.
[5964.97s -> 5975.48s]  What the hell was that? Yeah, all clear here. That was my phone. Our walkie. This is the boss.
[5975.48s -> 5982.10s]  All janitors have them. This is not done though. You got your soundboard.
[5990.76s -> 5994.68s]  I don't even feel wallpapered that room. Why is there on the camera? We could use that somewhere.
[5998.22s -> 6003.34s]  All right, the car looks pretty good. Johnny, we've left money in the pantry for you. Remember
[6003.34s -> 6008.30s]  to call us straight away if Jason or Danielle try to reach us in case something goes wrong
[6008.30s -> 6019.85s]  at the Crystal Lake summer camp. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Let's get this trash out of
[6019.85s -> 6028.49s]  here. Hello. You can use that. You can use that somewhere. I think you can use that somewhere.
[6029.37s -> 6044.57s]  Hello. Testing my mic. Well, don't worry. You'll disconnect again and I'll have plenty of use for
[6044.57s -> 6049.37s]  the hello. Yeah, you'll have plenty of use when I disconnect a fourth time today.
[6055.70s -> 6062.74s]  How about you stream when it's working? Like during the day? That is the theory. It is during
[6062.74s -> 6079.66s]  the day. Oh. Hello. Garage is almost clean. There are a couple of knives. I cleaned the front yard.
[6079.66s -> 6088.44s]  Front yard is clear. This is not trash. They're just knives. That's not garbage. It's a knife.
[6091.98s -> 6098.04s]  Here's the question. If we do such a good job of cleaning,
[6098.04s -> 6101.00s]  does that mean the parents never know what happened to their kids?
[6107.03s -> 6116.57s]  Well, no, because when they know what how would. Well, I just read that note that was telling them,
[6116.81s -> 6122.41s]  good luck at summer camp and blah, blah, blah. So if everything is spick and span and perfect
[6122.41s -> 6131.62s]  when they come back, how do they know what happened? So shouldn't we leave one blood
[6131.62s -> 6140.60s]  stain with a murder weapon? I mean, they've already been notified. Are we the bad guys?
[6140.60s -> 6145.58s]  No, we're just the cleaning crew. How do you know they've been notified?
[6146.46s -> 6150.70s]  Did Big Boss Man tell you that? I don't know. I'm just assuming that they've been notified.
[6151.58s -> 6156.38s]  Don't you ever think like outside what you're currently doing like your job? Do you ever think
[6156.38s -> 6170.34s]  like, you know, what if it's not all true? You read too many fucking books. You read too many
[6170.34s -> 6174.90s]  books. You should just be drinking tap water and eating fucking Cheerios like the rest of us.
[6175.86s -> 6189.16s]  Fuck, I broke the glass. Hello. I was on the front door. Hello. Hello. Hello. Let me fight
[6189.16s -> 6198.12s]  myself. Hey, what's up, dude? Nothing much. Hello. How are you? Hello. Hi. That's all I have.
[6199.24s -> 6202.92s]  I don't want to press the wrong button too. I'm forgetting which is which. I'm fucked up. I am.
[6203.72s -> 6209.72s]  Oh, I was pretty. So I got some stuff over here if you need it. I got some. I need a bucket over
[6209.72s -> 6217.74s]  here. Oh, cool. No, that was pretty cool. But not cool because the internet sucks. So just deal with
[6217.74s -> 6223.82s]  it. Cool. I'm not going to deal with it because that's fucking bullshit. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[6223.82s -> 6234.66s]  cool. Stop. Not funny. She laughed. The measurement of what's funny is if my wife laughs. So I think
[6234.66s -> 6245.62s]  you're wrong. I was trying to have me yell and talk to me. Oh, cool. You don't even you don't
[6246.42s -> 6253.22s]  get comedy. I've heard people compare this stream to
[6256.18s -> 6260.66s]  think I get comedy. And he's pretty close to the man upstairs himself from my hair. Yep.
[6265.18s -> 6270.95s]  What do you do with the USBs when you're done? You put them in the wrong way first every time.
[6270.95s -> 6286.34s]  You never get it right. First try. Oh, my God. And that to truth. Oh, my God. Is this how you
[6286.34s -> 6295.88s]  get on the roof? I know I tried to use that thing earlier. It doesn't go up on them. What's the
[6295.88s -> 6306.76s]  point? Dear Mr. And Mrs. Adams, I'm sorry to report that your son Jason has been implicated
[6306.76s -> 6312.20s]  in another unusual incident. This is the third time. So there was a look. See, they left a thing.
[6312.20s -> 6316.52s]  Where? Where? I want to read it. It's just it says like, it's like, could you please
[6316.52s -> 6321.64s]  next time respectfully hand it to me? Thank you. It's a game about physics. There is no such thing
[6321.64s -> 6333.59s]  as handing it to you. There is. No, this is a previous. This has nothing to do with everyone
[6333.59s -> 6339.11s]  being dead. No, this is you don't write like a kindly worded letter because he murdered like
[6339.11s -> 6350.26s]  eight people. Will you just come back into the room with the big dinner on it? All right. Is
[6350.26s -> 6358.50s]  this done? Give it a look. This room? Yeah. Bloody here. Chairs on the floor. I'm trying to do it.
[6360.82s -> 6365.08s]  You asked. Make sure you make sure you're not tracking like I am. I'm not tracking.
[6367.42s -> 6375.19s]  Glass. Respectfully putting the glass here. Actually, we need to put the tableware out.
[6375.75s -> 6382.66s]  That needs to be glass. Put it all out. So I can come home, have a nice dinner with no family
[6382.66s -> 6393.35s]  remaining. I want every goddamn honey. Calm down. It's your favorite breakfast. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[6394.71s -> 6409.29s]  Please give me them. Why are you stacking chairs like this? Well, you just smashed the plate
[6410.01s -> 6412.09s]  because I had to have to be glass breaking. What?
[6417.05s -> 6424.79s]  I'm trying to set the table and you'll be a dick. How am I? You're breaking things. I'm
[6426.22s -> 6431.24s]  Can I ask you how the chair got on the table? Can I just ask you smashed it? And I thought we
[6431.24s -> 6437.88s]  were smashing. So I joined you thought we were smashing things you made. We were smashing things.
[6437.88s -> 6445.75s]  So I joined you. I'm a follower. You know this about me. You and stuff with this chair.
[6447.27s -> 6458.04s]  What? Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's right. Somebody gifted you a sub last time.
[6463.74s -> 6480.49s]  The table is clean so I can do the table is going to be set. I should just move the chairs out of
[6480.49s -> 6494.17s]  the way. This is the oh my this is the grossest thing I found the whole time we've been doing
[6494.17s -> 6503.29s]  this. Where are you? This is the grossest thing. Like an old food container. Yeah. It's like green
[6503.29s -> 6514.54s]  and red like the pigs that we're cleaning up after. Okay. Table looks like I'm setting it.
[6515.18s -> 6522.15s]  I have to be completely honest. Yeah. I don't know why I'm doing this. Like why are we still
[6522.15s -> 6530.57s]  doing this? Because this is the game. So all right. It's kind of a bad job setting the table.
[6534.33s -> 6538.97s]  Three people eat on plates over here and then only people only get to have drinks over this way.
[6539.61s -> 6552.90s]  You're gonna put the push the chairs in like what the I bet you you won't break a plate. Oh,
[6552.90s -> 6559.48s]  and the head of the table. The head of the table gets the light in their face. That's no that's
[6559.48s -> 6564.28s]  just so they can inspect the food. No, that's so like you know that they're the one hosting the
[6564.36s -> 6570.87s]  dinner. Like a spotlight. Me, me, me. Hello.
[6577.90s -> 6590.94s]  Dude, I'm getting achievements like crazy. All right. So we have let's take a little bit
[6590.94s -> 6598.33s]  of an indent area here. Okay. I thought this was blood. This car was designed in MS paint.
[6602.68s -> 6614.41s]  All right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.
[6614.41s -> 6618.65s]  Right. Hello. Well, here comes. Yeah. Hello. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.
[6620.62s -> 6623.82s]  Is that because you want it to happen? I just was waiting for it to happen.
[6624.84s -> 6629.24s]  Do it. It's not funny. You do it. That's the thing. You've done it every time. Do it.
[6629.24s -> 6635.05s]  You're you're making me very uncomfortable. Do it. You do it every time. Do it. I'm just trying to
[6635.05s -> 6649.10s]  clean up. I don't think I can keep working under these conditions. Can I go home? One time he
[6649.10s -> 6668.89s]  doesn't use his like a fucking electro board to make like I don't feel well. We're almost done.
[6674.94s -> 6681.18s]  Are you going to check out that new game? Which new game? I don't know any of them. I've played
[6681.18s -> 6685.35s]  quite a few new games. Which one? I don't know. Do you have any new games you're going to check out?
[6686.31s -> 6696.36s]  Unreleased new games? No, not right now. Nothing new is coming out. There's a few things coming
[6696.36s -> 6703.88s]  out. There's always things coming out like every day. Um, I think super sexy made two is out on
[6703.88s -> 6724.25s]  steam for a few days already. What? What? The sequel. You're just trying to get yourself,
[6724.25s -> 6728.33s]  you know, ashes of remnant. Are you trying to like get your channel banned? No, that's a banned
[6728.33s -> 6736.17s]  video games. That's not streamable on Twitch. That's a banned stream game, isn't it? I don't
[6736.17s -> 6747.16s]  know. Don't they have like a banned no stream games? Probably. Nice. You did it. I didn't.
[6750.73s -> 6755.13s]  I didn't do that. You did it. I did it. You did it. I'm telling mommy. I'm telling mommy.
[6763.43s -> 6766.55s]  Get them all away. Wait a minute. We're doing this so stupidly. Put this in here.
[6766.55s -> 6783.88s]  You did it. You did it. Where's dad's flood light? I need it. I'm getting dad's floodlight for you.
[6783.88s -> 6789.24s]  I know you are vision impaired. I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I thought you
[6789.24s -> 6811.54s]  need it like a solar eclipse to be able to see anything. I don't need it. Okay. Clean.
[6812.79s -> 6830.54s]  Except for me. And there is a stick in here. Am I a vampire? Holy fuck. There's so many of these
[6830.54s -> 6836.01s]  here that I did not put here. That just surprised me how many you've put there. I thought it was
[6836.01s -> 6845.75s]  broken. How many of what? How many USB sticks? Oh no. I've been doing my job. Oh dude frying pan.
[6855.22s -> 6861.03s]  No, no. There was nothing wrong with that. Why'd you do that? I want a new one. Use this one.
[6863.22s -> 6876.25s]  Hold on. This one's good. Thank you. Now finish up. We're almost done with the house.
[6876.33s -> 6908.26s]  The house is almost completely good. Oh dude. Why did that? Why did that happen? Yeah. I wanted
[6908.26s -> 6912.82s]  to pick up the fucking torso that was buried at the bottom of the barrel. I didn't want to pick up
[6912.82s -> 6927.59s]  the barrel. I wanted to pick up the torso at the bottom. What is this? Make sure you hold shift
[6927.59s -> 6939.74s]  when you're walking too. To walk. I wouldn't want to drop anything. I wouldn't want to drop anything.
[6940.14s -> 6950.10s]  All the gold on the table. Gold on the table. You left some gold on the table. That's your joke.
[6950.74s -> 6958.06s]  That's not mine. If you want to make that, you mute me. Mute you and do that on your stream. Hello.
[6962.58s -> 6976.57s]  Oh cool. There it is. There it is. There it is. I watch any good TV lately. I thought that was a
[6976.57s -> 6983.69s]  soundboard thing. It was weird. Watch any good TV lately. It really was. It was like
[6984.57s -> 6992.90s]  abrupt and weird. Have I watched any good TV lately? What's the last TV that I watched?
[6997.08s -> 6999.16s]  I don't know. What's the last TV show that I actually watched?
[7001.94s -> 7006.17s]  I'm asking you. You should have that information. I don't know. I really don't know.
[7006.33s -> 7012.73s]  I don't know. Spider-Man? That's a movie. That's a movie. I'm not counting movies here.
[7014.42s -> 7027.19s]  I haven't really watched any TV. Outside is good. All right. We'll have to go through a little bit
[7027.19s -> 7033.16s]  and check out on it. What about the garage? The garage was good. Is it completely good?
[7033.88s -> 7038.44s]  I didn't detect any. It's the MS Paint car that I wish we could trash.
[7039.40s -> 7048.98s]  It looks like blood. No, that's Sting's car from WCW. Was his car MS Paint airbrushed and drawn on?
[7051.61s -> 7058.65s]  No. The car is awful. What is wrong with that car? What's the problem with that car? It's
[7058.65s -> 7065.29s]  really ugly, but it's not that big of a deal. It's ruining my immersion. We've got to get a
[7065.45s -> 7080.42s]  trash container here. Okay. I'm on it, boss. Let me get the gross light to see the fluorescent
[7080.42s -> 7089.82s]  light bulb so we can look at the ground and be like, oh, gross. The blue light behind you.
[7089.82s -> 7101.24s]  Where do you want this? In the living room. This is what happens when your landlord comes in and
[7101.24s -> 7107.32s]  is looking for piss. That's what he's looking for. What happened over here?
[7108.92s -> 7127.42s]  What? I'm just dealing with... Oh, there it is. Piss. Don't track. I don't track ever.
[7127.42s -> 7132.68s]  All right. Let's do this together. Why not? Two hands are better than one.
[7132.68s -> 7139.58s]  I've already put in like eight. Four hands are better than two, right? Thank you.
[7139.58s -> 7153.67s]  Let me get that for you. Put it down. All right,
[7153.67s -> 7175.53s]  to the first person I can chug one of these wins. Cool. I did it. Didn't you?
[7176.65s -> 7185.93s]  I love how much you fucking hated what I just did. No. You hated it. I respect the roleplay.
[7189.74s -> 7193.48s]  Here's a question. Stale joke.
[7196.12s -> 7202.26s]  What's your question? What's the worst character you can think of from TV or movie?
[7203.14s -> 7208.66s]  What would be your ideal worst character? Are we talking like things they did in the show
[7208.66s -> 7213.62s]  that were bad or... Like their personality, just like how bad of a... You don't care about,
[7213.62s -> 7224.81s]  they're just awful. You know, the worst character. I don't know. I can't think of
[7225.53s -> 7239.35s]  the character that I just hated. What do you got? I got nothing.
[7239.35s -> 7244.97s]  I was talking about it the other night with my significant other.
[7246.17s -> 7248.25s]  The worst character from any TV show that I've ever seen.
[7253.26s -> 7257.72s]  She hates the lawyer from Jessica Jones. Specific.
[7257.72s -> 7262.84s]  It's very specific. She said it was the worst character, so I was trying to come up with worse
[7262.84s -> 7267.72s]  ones. I forget what I came up with already. It was just last night and I have no intentions.
[7273.59s -> 7277.59s]  People saying Garfield. Garfield was a comic book before he was like a TV show,
[7277.59s -> 7282.79s]  and the TV show was good. Garfield and Friends. That was not a bad show.
[7283.99s -> 7289.03s]  You're smashing blood. What? You just destroyed that doorway.
[7296.23s -> 7300.63s]  From the 100. That's a good one. That's good. I don't know. I don't watch that much TV.
[7301.59s -> 7305.83s]  I don't have a base on anything.
[7321.02s -> 7323.98s]  The mood is very live. And all you have to say is...
[7323.98s -> 7326.98s]  Oh, I'm cool. That went the wrong way.
[7330.18s -> 7334.74s]  Come on. Come on, dude. Why can't I play that back to you?
[7334.74s -> 7339.38s]  Come on, dude. Come on. Because you don't have the thing.
[7340.18s -> 7342.42s]  You'd be more than welcome to do it if you had the thing.
[7343.22s -> 7353.10s]  What about the pumpkins out here? We should probably set those up.
[7353.10s -> 7358.41s]  Hello? I need one of these.
[7359.29s -> 7361.75s]  There's still lots of buckets out here that need to be disposed of.
[7364.79s -> 7365.67s]  Delete yourself.
[7372.20s -> 7375.32s]  At least it's good to know I have a future in being a janitor.
[7383.72s -> 7386.44s]  I'm stuck on this. What character is the worst character in any TV show?
[7388.76s -> 7395.42s]  Who the fuck is it? Name me a TV show that I've watched, that you know I've watched.
[7396.46s -> 7402.97s]  The only show that I know you've watched is Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.
[7402.97s -> 7413.94s]  Oh. Ross from Friends.
[7416.15s -> 7417.83s]  What? I've never seen that.
[7417.83s -> 7420.07s]  I don't... Why? I thought people liked him.
[7428.14s -> 7433.70s]  Peggy from King of the Hill. That's disrespectful.
[7433.70s -> 7443.06s]  She is a loving, caring, family woman. She goes to great lengths to provide when Hank can't.
[7444.81s -> 7449.29s]  She makes a miraculous recovery from falling out of a fucking airplane.
[7453.38s -> 7454.74s]  And she's not good enough for you.
[7468.06s -> 7470.78s]  I mean, I like Peggy Hill.
[7473.37s -> 7478.22s]  How about The Vision? I hate The Vision.
[7479.51s -> 7485.80s]  Open this door. Open this door! What are you doing out there?
[7486.52s -> 7487.56s]  I'm fucking cleaning.
[7491.56s -> 7493.00s]  Who's closing doors?
[7499.83s -> 7501.03s]  What did you do with the USBs?
[7502.10s -> 7503.30s]  What USBs?
[7503.30s -> 7506.58s]  The USB drives I've been collecting. This whole time.
[7507.70s -> 7510.42s]  You were just out... Do you think I'm capable, like,
[7510.42s -> 7514.42s]  number one, physically, or number two, mentally, being able to move all those in less than 30 seconds?
[7516.22s -> 7517.82s]  Yes. You really think that?
[7529.58s -> 7530.94s]  Typically, you would be the one to be like,
[7530.94s -> 7533.82s]  no, you could never do that in that amount of time. You're just so slow.
[7536.07s -> 7538.39s]  You're very athletic when you want to be. You did a...
[7539.99s -> 7541.43s]  What's it called from the top rope?
[7543.40s -> 7545.16s]  What? A whirlwind or something?
[7545.16s -> 7546.68s]  A whirlwind?
[7546.68s -> 7550.18s]  I don't know. What's it called? Triple Lindy?
[7550.18s -> 7554.02s]  A triple... What? No, it's called a...
[7555.14s -> 7555.86s]  Hurricana?
[7555.86s -> 7557.06s]  Hurricanrana.
[7557.62s -> 7560.34s]  Hurricanrana. Yeah, he can do one of those.
[7560.42s -> 7563.06s]  Did you guys... You should have seen him at the trampoline park.
[7563.06s -> 7564.98s]  Oh, I was... I was good.
[7564.98s -> 7567.14s]  Dude, this six-year-old came up to him and was like,
[7567.14s -> 7570.42s]  can I help you out a bit? And he freaking hurricanrana'd him right off.
[7573.78s -> 7574.28s]  Bam!
[7587.06s -> 7588.02s]  You had to go home early.
[7590.33s -> 7593.45s]  Yeah, that was you in that scenario. I hurricanrana'd you.
[7595.67s -> 7599.59s]  He started talking shit and I just, like, jumped way high over your head and just, like,
[7599.59s -> 7602.42s]  boom! Landed right on your shoulders.
[7602.42s -> 7603.78s]  Twisted back and you flipped forward.
[7604.94s -> 7607.26s]  I remember specifically the whole time you were going,
[7607.26s -> 7608.70s]  I'm sorry! I'm wicked sorry! I'm sorry!
[7609.82s -> 7611.42s]  What was I sorry about?
[7611.42s -> 7619.59s]  The fact that you... What am I gonna do with this?
[7620.63s -> 7621.91s]  What was I sorry about?
[7623.69s -> 7628.58s]  You, like, made fun of me. You said I was acting like a six-year-old.
[7630.44s -> 7635.00s]  No, I said you were... I said you were using wrestling moves on six-year-old.
[7636.34s -> 7639.38s]  Oh, all right. Well, let's go ahead and move on from that conversation.
[7639.38s -> 7640.90s]  I did rip my pants, actually.
[7641.46s -> 7643.94s]  Yeah, you did rip your pants. That's actually rude. That's true.
[7644.58s -> 7646.74s]  I'm... Your voice when you remembered.
[7646.74s -> 7648.10s]  He did. He did. I can turn this on.
[7648.10s -> 7649.14s]  No, he ripped his pants.
[7649.14s -> 7650.66s]  It's not about me. He ripped his pants.
[7650.66s -> 7651.30s]  He ripped his pants.
[7651.30s -> 7652.10s]  It was embarrassing.
[7654.65s -> 7655.15s]  Nope.
[7659.26s -> 7662.30s]  Okay, wait. For a second. For a second.
[7663.75s -> 7667.51s]  I thought I... I thought I threw away X.
[7668.07s -> 7669.91s]  And I was about to be like, oh, fuck.
[7670.71s -> 7672.95s]  Good thing I didn't throw away X.
[7674.63s -> 7675.11s]  Yeah.
[7675.11s -> 7676.39s]  They are shaped the same.
[7677.11s -> 7684.12s]  All right. So, how's the episode?
[7684.68s -> 7685.40s]  So, the vision.
[7686.74s -> 7690.10s]  The vision. No. Yeah. Okay. You think I do embarrassing things?
[7690.98s -> 7693.46s]  You not only have ripped your pants in front of me.
[7693.46s -> 7695.22s]  You've also shit your pants on spring.
[7698.70s -> 7705.58s]  So, I think I get like times one million points in the other direction.
[7705.58s -> 7706.86s]  I won that quick play match.
[7708.70s -> 7709.20s]  So...
[7715.58s -> 7720.86s]  It's like, honest to God, the most fucking disgusting, fucked up thing ever.
[7723.66s -> 7724.46s]  Ever.
[7724.46s -> 7724.96s]  Ever.
[7730.68s -> 7731.40s]  It's, uh...
[7731.40s -> 7732.04s]  What am I doing?
[7732.76s -> 7734.92s]  Pretty low of you to judge another man's butthole.
[7737.56s -> 7738.92s]  What is this? A vacuum?
[7738.92s -> 7741.40s]  I'm sure yours has done some things it's not too proud of.
[7741.40s -> 7742.84s]  How do I turn on the vacuum?
[7743.96s -> 7746.28s]  Oh, yeah. Not talking about this anymore.
[7747.16s -> 7749.00s]  Oh, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
[7749.88s -> 7750.84s]  Jerry! Jerry, come out here.
[7753.24s -> 7754.04s]  Jerry, get out here.
[7754.68s -> 7759.53s]  Hello? Get out the front door.
[7759.53s -> 7760.33s]  What?
[7760.33s -> 7761.61s]  Get out the front door. Out the front door. Quick.
[7763.11s -> 7764.09s]  Why?
[7764.09s -> 7765.85s]  Because you're about to see something amazing.
[7767.29s -> 7769.29s]  Coming. Coming, honey.
[7769.29s -> 7772.09s]  I found the vacuum that plays music.
[7772.09s -> 7775.37s]  Look, I'm jumping. I'm jumping.
[7775.37s -> 7775.93s]  Can you see me?
[7776.57s -> 7781.13s]  Look at your map.
[7781.13s -> 7781.77s]  Come here.
[7781.77s -> 7794.58s]  Okay, now you do the work while I'll be the support.
[7797.21s -> 7798.17s]  I'm your healer.
[7800.39s -> 7802.15s]  I'm leaving if you don't get rid of that.
[7802.71s -> 7805.42s]  I was at a vacuum.
[7810.66s -> 7812.84s]  Wait, now we can't get it.
[7812.84s -> 7814.20s]  I just realized what I'm doing.
[7814.20s -> 7815.88s]  That can never turn off.
[7815.88s -> 7817.48s]  I threw some pumpkins out there earlier.
[7822.04s -> 7823.08s]  You're gonna get us in trouble.
[7823.08s -> 7823.64s]  Don't do that.
[7824.44s -> 7826.20s]  You think you can get one over the fence?
[7826.20s -> 7826.52s]  I think so.
[7826.52s -> 7827.96s]  We both get one throw.
[7827.96s -> 7829.08s]  One throw to get it over the fence?
[7829.64s -> 7830.68s]  Yeah, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[7831.88s -> 7834.92s]  Into like, crabby Carol's yard?
[7835.56s -> 7836.68s]  Yeah, fuck Carol.
[7839.32s -> 7839.96s]  Holy shit.
[7839.96s -> 7843.00s]  I just, that was like, I, there's nobody's gonna,
[7843.00s -> 7844.28s]  I just went to the driving range.
[7845.08s -> 7845.80s]  No, I'm sorry.
[7845.80s -> 7846.60s]  I went to the driving range.
[7850.14s -> 7852.30s]  Hey, you want to take this and like throw it out?
[7853.34s -> 7854.86s]  Dude, no, it was over the roof.
[7858.97s -> 7861.13s]  Oh, Nuddy, no, no, no, no, no, no, Nuddy.
[7861.13s -> 7863.05s]  Close, I'm going over Carol's roof.
[7863.05s -> 7863.77s]  Check this shit out.
[7864.41s -> 7868.46s]  Where'd it go?
[7869.75s -> 7870.71s]  You got it over the house.
[7870.71s -> 7871.91s]  Did it go so far over the house?
[7871.91s -> 7872.87s]  It didn't go straight.
[7872.87s -> 7873.91s]  It went off to the right.
[7878.28s -> 7879.58s]  You got in my way.
[7879.58s -> 7881.10s]  I don't know where mine went.
[7881.10s -> 7882.46s]  I'm gonna assume I hit the moon.
[7885.24s -> 7887.40s]  Okay, why do I still hear the music?
[7892.30s -> 7893.50s]  Why is music coming from the house?
[7895.35s -> 7896.79s]  Oh, there's a new one over here.
[7896.79s -> 7899.27s]  Oh, get rid of this fucking thing.
[7899.91s -> 7905.46s]  Does it spawn?
[7907.91s -> 7908.87s]  Now I miss the music.
[7915.10s -> 7916.14s]  All right, back upstairs.
[7917.50s -> 7918.38s]  God damn it.
[7918.38s -> 7919.18s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7919.18s -> 7919.90s]  Take this trash out.
[7919.90s -> 7920.86s]  Take the trash outside.
[7920.86s -> 7922.62s]  When do I get my obligated?
[7922.62s -> 7923.34s]  I'm like, ugh.
[7928.36s -> 7930.68s]  Just running and heaving the trash into me.
[7936.42s -> 7937.94s]  What am I doing with my trash?
[7938.74s -> 7950.84s]  Oh my god, this music is like all in my left ear.
[7955.59s -> 7956.23s]  Where are you?
[7956.23s -> 7957.27s]  Are you up in the?
[7957.27s -> 7958.39s]  I'm in the backyard.
[7958.39s -> 7959.11s]  What are we doing?
[7959.11s -> 7961.99s]  All right, go upstairs.
[7961.99s -> 7963.19s]  We need to get in a bucket.
[7963.19s -> 7964.07s]  Is that okay?
[7964.07s -> 7964.55s]  That's fine.
[7977.70s -> 7978.66s]  Where are you?
[7978.66s -> 7979.70s]  I'm coming upstairs right now.
[7986.68s -> 7988.44s]  This music is so loud and annoying.
[7989.16s -> 7990.12s]  Why did you have to do this?
[7991.27s -> 7991.99s]  The fuck?
[7991.99s -> 7992.79s]  Turn your music down.
[7993.51s -> 7997.06s]  It's really not that hard to turn your music down.
[7997.06s -> 7998.82s]  No, it's the principle.
[8001.14s -> 8002.26s]  Where is this coming from?
[8005.16s -> 8006.20s]  It's like in the wall.
[8008.71s -> 8010.71s]  Don't get that trash out of here.
[8011.67s -> 8018.12s]  Are you going to get in Krabby Carroll's front yard?
[8027.24s -> 8028.68s]  We're never going to complete the level now.
[8029.40s -> 8034.07s]  I hope you're happy.
[8036.01s -> 8036.81s]  No music.
[8036.81s -> 8037.21s]  Quiet.
[8037.21s -> 8038.65s]  I want complete silence.
[8038.65s -> 8041.37s]  All right, so let's take this party upstairs.
[8043.34s -> 8044.54s]  I'm going to bring a couple of buckets.
[8045.42s -> 8045.98s]  Oh yeah?
[8047.02s -> 8047.82s]  What else are you going to do?
[8049.74s -> 8050.62s]  Oh, relax.
[8053.50s -> 8054.22s]  Relax.
[8055.18s -> 8056.14s]  How many buckets?
[8057.98s -> 8058.48s]  Two.
[8060.74s -> 8061.46s]  Oh yeah?
[8066.76s -> 8072.41s]  Do you have one of those trash compactors up there?
[8073.45s -> 8073.95s]  Yeah.
[8074.33s -> 8076.33s]  There really is just party music playing.
[8077.75s -> 8078.71s]  Why is it in the house?
[8079.86s -> 8081.06s]  I turned my music off.
[8081.06s -> 8081.54s]  I don't know.
[8081.54s -> 8083.06s]  It was like in a wall and I couldn't find it.
[8083.86s -> 8093.13s]  All right, I got two buckets of water.
[8093.77s -> 8095.05s]  Which room are you in?
[8096.12s -> 8097.16s]  I'm in the hallway.
[8097.96s -> 8098.96s]  Okay.
[8099.50s -> 8100.70s]  Please be careful.
[8105.74s -> 8107.26s]  Are you trying to do something dumb?
[8107.98s -> 8110.30s]  Because we need these buckets.
[8110.94s -> 8112.46s]  And you just came over and whacked me.
[8116.70s -> 8117.50s]  Won't happen again boss.
[8117.50s -> 8118.30s]  It's getting louder.
[8119.58s -> 8120.08s]  Yeah.
[8120.46s -> 8122.06s]  All right, so which room are we doing?
[8122.06s -> 8122.56s]  Excuse me.
[8123.88s -> 8124.38s]  This one?
[8125.59s -> 8127.83s]  This room is nearly done.
[8127.83s -> 8129.03s]  That wasn't this competition room?
[8129.67s -> 8130.87s]  It might have been.
[8132.18s -> 8133.30s]  No, you did the other one.
[8133.30s -> 8135.30s]  This closet is bad.
[8139.78s -> 8141.30s]  Ah, fuck dude.
[8144.97s -> 8146.60s]  What's up?
[8147.06s -> 8153.53s]  Are you good?
[8153.53s -> 8154.17s]  What happened?
[8154.17s -> 8154.97s]  I'm good, I'm good.
[8155.77s -> 8157.37s]  This one, I can take this one.
[8157.93s -> 8163.06s]  It's just blood, a little bit of guts.
[8163.78s -> 8164.28s]  I guess.
[8164.74s -> 8165.46s]  There's a note too.
[8166.26s -> 8172.54s]  Where does this lead?
[8172.54s -> 8173.04s]  This window.
[8178.38s -> 8178.94s]  We're good.
[8178.94s -> 8179.50s]  I'm good.
[8179.50s -> 8180.46s]  My room's clean.
[8180.46s -> 8181.34s]  I beat you.
[8181.34s -> 8181.98s]  My room's clean.
[8181.98s -> 8182.30s]  I beat you.
[8182.30s -> 8182.86s]  My room's clean.
[8182.86s -> 8183.98s]  I beat you.
[8183.98s -> 8185.18s]  Which window is near a thing?
[8186.14s -> 8186.78s]  No, that's it.
[8187.58s -> 8189.14s]  I think I can get it.
[8190.66s -> 8191.30s]  Give me a hand here.
[8192.12s -> 8192.62s]  No.
[8194.09s -> 8195.13s]  I have my own duties.
[8196.01s -> 8196.41s]  Got it.
[8196.41s -> 8197.21s]  Come on.
[8197.21s -> 8197.71s]  Do it.
[8198.49s -> 8198.99s]  Do what?
[8200.01s -> 8200.57s]  I'm in trouble.
[8201.69s -> 8202.73s]  Coming, coming.
[8202.73s -> 8204.33s]  I'm going to come and kill you out.
[8204.33s -> 8204.83s]  I don't know.
[8208.76s -> 8209.56s]  I don't know what's going on.
[8210.28s -> 8210.84s]  Did you do that?
[8212.20s -> 8212.70s]  Do what?
[8213.32s -> 8216.04s]  Weirdly enough, the whole game's procedurally generated.
[8216.76s -> 8219.16s]  So we kind of have an issue out here.
[8223.40s -> 8224.84s]  I did not do that.
[8224.84s -> 8226.36s]  I think it's procedurally generated.
[8227.96s -> 8229.32s]  Hold on, I got this.
[8229.32s -> 8230.12s]  Did you just kill me?
[8232.14s -> 8233.02s]  You just killed me.
[8233.74s -> 8234.78s]  How did you kill me?
[8235.90s -> 8236.40s]  What?
[8237.18s -> 8237.66s]  I don't know.
[8237.66s -> 8239.74s]  You just goomba stomped me and broke my neck.
[8240.30s -> 8241.42s]  I got her off the roof.
[8241.42s -> 8242.46s]  Why did I die?
[8245.82s -> 8247.02s]  No time for your jokes.
[8247.02s -> 8248.70s]  Why is this about number four?
[8252.84s -> 8254.04s]  There is no joke there.
[8254.04s -> 8255.96s]  You actually jumped on my head and broke my neck.
[8255.96s -> 8256.76s]  That's not funny.
[8256.76s -> 8257.72s]  That's not funny.
[8257.72s -> 8261.64s]  Please don't imply that I would be involved in any tomfoolery.
[8262.52s -> 8264.60s]  All right, you knocked her off?
[8264.60s -> 8266.12s]  My mom's watching, okay?
[8266.12s -> 8266.76s]  Where is she?
[8267.64s -> 8269.85s]  What?
[8270.23s -> 8271.35s]  Did you knock her off the front or back?
[8272.39s -> 8273.19s]  My mom?
[8273.19s -> 8274.15s]  I threw her off the front.
[8275.19s -> 8276.23s]  Stop tracking it.
[8277.19s -> 8278.47s]  You're tracking it.
[8278.47s -> 8279.03s]  I don't see her.
[8279.03s -> 8279.91s]  Where did you knock her off?
[8280.63s -> 8283.80s]  She was in the bushes.
[8283.80s -> 8284.28s]  I got her.
[8284.92s -> 8287.51s]  There's still a spot of blood up there that I can't get.
[8288.23s -> 8289.56s]  Where did this guy come from?
[8299.86s -> 8304.97s]  Thanks for nothing, game.
[8304.97s -> 8305.93s]  Thanks for nothing.
[8305.93s -> 8307.45s]  When do we get guns?
[8307.45s -> 8308.57s]  You don't get guns.
[8309.21s -> 8310.65s]  Not every game has to have a gun.
[8311.37s -> 8313.77s]  Not every game has to have like,
[8313.77s -> 8315.53s]  get on the cart and shoot the gun.
[8316.41s -> 8323.48s]  I don't know.
[8323.48s -> 8325.00s]  I'm a back-in-the-day gamer.
[8328.65s -> 8329.85s]  A purist, if you will.
[8330.81s -> 8331.29s]  Why not?
[8333.67s -> 8336.07s]  All right, we are getting very, very close, my friend.
[8341.61s -> 8342.65s]  Take my buckets!
[8344.38s -> 8344.88s]  Hello?
[8346.49s -> 8348.25s]  I thought that was you, but it was me.
[8352.10s -> 8354.42s]  I thought you were doing a, quote,
[8355.46s -> 8356.50s]  German impression.
[8356.50s -> 8357.00s]  Hello?
[8358.20s -> 8358.70s]  No.
[8358.70s -> 8359.20s]  Hello?
[8359.20s -> 8359.70s]  Hello?
[8359.70s -> 8360.20s]  Hello?
[8360.20s -> 8360.70s]  Hello?
[8360.70s -> 8361.20s]  Hello?
[8366.18s -> 8366.98s]  Kid thinks he's funny.
[8366.98s -> 8367.48s]  Hello?
[8367.48s -> 8367.98s]  Hello?
[8367.98s -> 8368.48s]  Hello?
[8369.14s -> 8370.26s]  Fucking kid thinks he's funny.
[8372.71s -> 8373.27s]  That's, uh...
[8373.99s -> 8374.49s]  Okay.
[8374.49s -> 8375.93s]  When you're walking down the street,
[8375.93s -> 8378.17s]  and 50% of the people are germos.
[8379.13s -> 8379.63s]  Hello?
[8379.63s -> 8380.13s]  Hello?
[8380.13s -> 8380.63s]  Hello?
[8380.63s -> 8381.13s]  Hello?
[8381.95s -> 8382.75s]  No, I didn't see it.
[8383.63s -> 8385.63s]  Where else would I have come up with this if I didn't, like...
[8385.63s -> 8386.13s]  That's a great video.
[8386.13s -> 8387.39s]  You think I have an imagination?
[8389.88s -> 8390.76s]  Something in the attic.
[8392.62s -> 8393.50s]  Something in the attic.
[8395.66s -> 8396.54s]  Is it creepy?
[8396.54s -> 8397.34s]  Something in the attic.
[8397.90s -> 8399.15s]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[8399.15s -> 8400.33s]  Oh, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.
[8400.33s -> 8401.53s]  Come here, come here, come here.
[8401.53s -> 8402.03s]  I'm gonna...
[8403.82s -> 8404.46s]  Ow, my head.
[8405.18s -> 8406.62s]  Come here.
[8407.08s -> 8408.21s]  Where are you?
[8408.75s -> 8410.83s]  This is authentic.
[8410.83s -> 8412.19s]  Like, four people died on this.
[8412.19s -> 8412.69s]  It's gonna work.
[8413.47s -> 8414.75s]  Oh, shit.
[8414.75s -> 8415.63s]  All right, bring it to the bathroom.
[8416.91s -> 8417.55s]  Oh.
[8417.55s -> 8418.27s]  Oh, it's a weed.
[8418.27s -> 8420.75s]  I thought we were gonna try and go down the stairs on it.
[8420.75s -> 8421.25s]  No.
[8421.56s -> 8422.06s]  All right.
[8422.60s -> 8423.10s]  So...
[8423.10s -> 8425.08s]  Authentic people have died on this.
[8425.08s -> 8425.58s]  Vooja.
[8427.53s -> 8428.33s]  All right, you ready?
[8428.33s -> 8428.97s]  Put your hand on my...
[8428.97s -> 8429.69s]  Put your hand on my hand.
[8431.96s -> 8432.36s]  Thanks.
[8432.36s -> 8432.86s]  Okay.
[8432.92s -> 8433.42s]  Okay.
[8433.64s -> 8435.10s]  No, wait, we need to...
[8435.10s -> 8435.60s]  I need to...
[8436.80s -> 8437.30s]  Ghost!
[8437.76s -> 8438.26s]  So...
[8438.26s -> 8439.36s]  Ghost, can you hear us?
[8439.36s -> 8439.86s]  When the tip is on that.
[8439.86s -> 8440.36s]  Hello?
[8440.80s -> 8442.94s]  All right, you ready?
[8443.40s -> 8443.90s]  Take...
[8443.90s -> 8444.40s]  Grab my hand.
[8444.40s -> 8444.90s]  Tight.
[8444.90s -> 8445.40s]  Tighter.
[8445.40s -> 8446.20s]  I'm tight.
[8446.20s -> 8446.70s]  Ow!
[8446.70s -> 8447.32s]  Fucking God!
[8447.32s -> 8448.04s]  Not that hard.
[8448.04s -> 8448.84s]  What's wrong with you?
[8449.66s -> 8450.16s]  Tighter.
[8451.02s -> 8451.52s]  Dear...
[8451.66s -> 8452.16s]  Ow.
[8452.16s -> 8455.02s]  Dear spirits of the realm of...
[8455.58s -> 8457.76s]  Let's turn the light off.
[8457.76s -> 8458.26s]  Can we?
[8459.60s -> 8460.56s]  Uh, yeah.
[8460.56s -> 8465.89s]  Oh, that door closed by itself!
[8467.86s -> 8470.29s]  Okay, hand back on.
[8470.29s -> 8470.79s]  Okay.
[8471.52s -> 8474.85s]  Spirits of the otherworldly creatures,
[8475.84s -> 8477.12s]  give us a sign.
[8477.12s -> 8481.42s]  Are you here in the room with us right now?
[8481.42s -> 8482.22s]  No, I was talking about the...
[8482.22s -> 8483.58s]  Yeah, I was talking about the ear.
[8483.58s -> 8484.08s]  You fuck...
[8484.08s -> 8487.26s]  Stop fucking up the spirit mojo here.
[8487.26s -> 8487.76s]  Come on.
[8488.40s -> 8488.90s]  Okay.
[8489.62s -> 8490.74s]  Are you in the room right now?
[8491.42s -> 8493.10s]  You fucking guys are so bad at this game.
[8493.10s -> 8494.46s]  Like, I'm missing dinner now.
[8494.46s -> 8498.61s]  Are you doing this?
[8500.00s -> 8500.56s]  Yeah, what?
[8500.56s -> 8501.06s]  No.
[8501.06s -> 8502.24s]  Are you moving this?
[8502.24s -> 8503.04s]  I'm not doing this.
[8503.04s -> 8503.68s]  Are you doing this?
[8503.68s -> 8504.18s]  Yeah.
[8504.48s -> 8506.27s]  Yeah, I am.
[8506.27s -> 8508.13s]  I'm moving it.
[8508.13s -> 8508.63s]  No, wait.
[8508.63s -> 8509.13s]  No, I'm not.
[8509.13s -> 8509.81s]  That's not how this works.
[8510.61s -> 8511.97s]  Put your hand back on.
[8513.18s -> 8513.68s]  Ow.
[8513.68s -> 8514.86s]  You just admitted you were moving it.
[8514.86s -> 8515.50s]  No, just put it down.
[8515.50s -> 8516.00s]  Put it down.
[8516.00s -> 8516.50s]  No.
[8517.39s -> 8517.89s]  Okay.
[8517.89s -> 8518.51s]  Okay, it's down.
[8518.51s -> 8519.01s]  It's down.
[8519.47s -> 8519.97s]  Hold on.
[8519.97s -> 8521.15s]  Wait, we gotta get some more blood on this.
[8522.67s -> 8523.17s]  Hold on.
[8523.17s -> 8523.67s]  Wait.
[8524.35s -> 8525.47s]  Just keep it there right there.
[8526.03s -> 8526.99s]  Get in the shower with me.
[8528.35s -> 8530.45s]  Wait a minute.
[8530.45s -> 8530.95s]  Oh shit.
[8531.89s -> 8532.39s]  Okay.
[8532.39s -> 8533.01s]  I thought it was done.
[8535.49s -> 8536.53s]  It's too dark.
[8537.17s -> 8538.37s]  It's too dark in the house.
[8539.17s -> 8539.97s]  I can't see.
[8541.84s -> 8542.24s]  I don't know.
[8542.24s -> 8544.08s]  My camera's turned way fucking down.
[8544.08s -> 8544.32s]  All right.
[8544.32s -> 8545.04s]  Where's the bathroom?
[8545.68s -> 8546.16s]  All right.
[8546.16s -> 8546.72s]  I need blood.
[8546.72s -> 8547.28s]  Give me blood.
[8547.28s -> 8547.84s]  I need blood.
[8548.48s -> 8549.36s]  Why do you need blood?
[8549.36s -> 8550.24s]  Because I need to...
[8550.24s -> 8550.56s]  All right.
[8550.56s -> 8551.28s]  It's bloodied up.
[8551.28s -> 8551.60s]  Good.
[8551.60s -> 8552.10s]  Set it down.
[8556.99s -> 8557.31s]  All right.
[8557.31s -> 8559.07s]  Let's close the fucking door.
[8559.07s -> 8560.91s]  Everyone, put your seat belts back on.
[8560.91s -> 8561.15s]  All right.
[8561.15s -> 8561.87s]  Put your seat belts on.
[8561.87s -> 8562.51s]  Put your hand...
[8563.15s -> 8566.43s]  Put your hand on my hand.
[8566.43s -> 8566.83s]  What?
[8566.83s -> 8567.07s]  Ow.
[8567.07s -> 8568.19s]  Why was my face?
[8568.19s -> 8569.39s]  Put your hand on my fucking hand.
[8569.39s -> 8569.63s]  No.
[8569.63s -> 8571.79s]  I was doing the clapper for the video.
[8573.73s -> 8574.05s]  Okay.
[8575.60s -> 8576.00s]  Grasp.
[8577.09s -> 8577.49s]  Yo.
[8577.49s -> 8578.37s]  What's going on, everybody?
[8578.37s -> 8579.25s]  Just being German here.
[8579.25s -> 8579.49s]  Hey.
[8579.49s -> 8580.21s]  What's going on, everybody?
[8580.21s -> 8580.61s]  We're here.
[8580.61s -> 8581.89s]  We're doing the Ouija board.
[8581.89s -> 8582.29s]  Are you ready?
[8582.29s -> 8583.49s]  Spirits, are you in the room with us?
[8584.37s -> 8587.18s]  Dude, this is fucking freaky.
[8587.18s -> 8587.90s]  Is this you doing that?
[8588.94s -> 8590.06s]  I don't think it's me doing it.
[8591.70s -> 8592.34s]  This is on yes.
[8593.70s -> 8594.34s]  Oh my god.
[8594.34s -> 8594.74s]  No, no, no.
[8594.74s -> 8596.26s]  Don't touch it.
[8596.26s -> 8597.22s]  I'm not touching it.
[8597.22s -> 8597.86s]  I'm not.
[8597.86s -> 8598.98s]  What the fuck is happening then?
[8599.54s -> 8599.78s]  Okay.
[8600.50s -> 8602.98s]  Spirits, are you moving around the object?
[8603.78s -> 8606.11s]  I'm not touching it, dude.
[8606.11s -> 8607.15s]  I'm not touching this.
[8607.15s -> 8608.03s]  I never touched it.
[8610.62s -> 8610.78s]  G.
[8611.42s -> 8612.96s]  What's G?
[8612.96s -> 8614.88s]  Do you have a family member named G?
[8615.60s -> 8616.94s]  Oh my god.
[8616.94s -> 8617.50s]  It's for you.
[8617.50s -> 8618.54s]  It's Germa.
[8618.54s -> 8619.42s]  No, that's a J.
[8619.42s -> 8620.94s]  Do you have anybody named G?
[8621.58s -> 8623.63s]  Oh my god.
[8623.63s -> 8624.35s]  It's Gerald.
[8626.30s -> 8626.86s]  Are you doing this?
[8626.86s -> 8627.98s]  I'm serious.
[8627.98s -> 8628.30s]  I'm serious.
[8628.30s -> 8628.78s]  Are you doing this?
[8629.26s -> 8630.54s]  Are you moving this?
[8632.51s -> 8632.83s]  A.
[8632.83s -> 8633.07s]  G.
[8633.07s -> 8633.23s]  A.
[8635.07s -> 8635.47s]  Gary.
[8635.47s -> 8636.83s]  Do you know anybody in the family named Gary?
[8637.47s -> 8637.95s]  No.
[8637.95s -> 8639.15s]  Spirit, are you Gary?
[8640.24s -> 8641.04s]  No, not Gary.
[8642.48s -> 8644.56s]  Spirit, spell the rest of your name.
[8648.93s -> 8649.09s]  M.
[8651.76s -> 8652.08s]  Gam.
[8653.04s -> 8653.92s]  Gam.
[8653.92s -> 8654.24s]  Gam.
[8654.96s -> 8655.44s]  Game.
[8655.44s -> 8656.80s]  Game, game, game, game, game, game, game.
[8656.80s -> 8657.52s]  Put it down.
[8657.52s -> 8658.08s]  Are you touching this?
[8658.72s -> 8658.96s]  No.
[8659.70s -> 8659.94s]  Fuck.
[8660.50s -> 8662.00s]  It's on the S.
[8662.00s -> 8663.04s]  Fuck, dude.
[8663.04s -> 8664.08s]  Gam.
[8664.08s -> 8664.64s]  Gam's.
[8664.64s -> 8665.36s]  Game sucks.
[8665.92s -> 8667.65s]  I'm not moving this.
[8668.58s -> 8669.06s]  Gam6.
[8669.62s -> 8673.38s]  Gam, I think that's the demon's name.
[8673.38s -> 8673.94s]  Gam6.
[8673.94s -> 8674.58s]  Gam6.
[8674.58s -> 8676.42s]  Oh, terrible demon of ours.
[8677.50s -> 8678.62s]  What do you want us to do?
[8687.55s -> 8688.83s]  Oh, okay, sorry.
[8691.70s -> 8692.50s]  Gam6.
[8692.50s -> 8695.22s]  I forget where the letter is, Gam6.
[8695.22s -> 8698.50s]  I don't remember where the letter is in the alphabet because we're upside down.
[8699.22s -> 8701.86s]  Gam6, please move me in the right direction if you could, please.
[8703.07s -> 8703.71s]  Gam6.
[8703.71s -> 8704.19s]  Oh.
[8704.19s -> 8704.59s]  Whoa.
[8704.59s -> 8705.23s]  Oh, fuck.
[8706.13s -> 8710.53s]  He just made me move over here.
[8710.53s -> 8710.85s]  Q.
[8713.10s -> 8713.66s]  Are you moving this?
[8716.37s -> 8716.61s]  You?
[8717.57s -> 8717.89s]  Can we?
[8719.94s -> 8720.50s]  There's an I.
[8720.50s -> 8721.22s]  I think that's an I.
[8722.61s -> 8722.93s]  Quit.
[8722.93s -> 8723.25s]  Quit.
[8723.89s -> 8742.13s]  Are you moving this?
[8743.09s -> 8743.73s]  I'm not moving it.
[8743.73s -> 8744.37s]  Are you moving this?
[8745.33s -> 8746.05s]  Are you moving this?
[8746.05s -> 8746.77s]  Are you doing this?
[8748.61s -> 8749.57s]  Is that you moving this?
[8749.57s -> 8750.53s]  Dude, stop me moving this.
[8751.41s -> 8752.37s]  Dude, are you moving this, dude?
[8753.17s -> 8754.13s]  Dude, stop me moving this.
[8757.02s -> 8757.58s]  It's not me.
[8758.22s -> 8758.86s]  Are you moving that?
[8759.58s -> 8761.02s]  Oh my god, is this the demon lord?
[8761.02s -> 8761.66s]  Game sucks.
[8762.30s -> 8763.18s]  Dude, are you picking this up?
[8763.18s -> 8763.74s]  Did you move this?
[8764.46s -> 8769.70s]  Dude, I'm walking down the stairs.
[8769.70s -> 8770.82s]  Are you walking down the stairs right now?
[8770.82s -> 8771.38s]  I'm not.
[8771.38s -> 8774.88s]  Am I?
[8774.88s -> 8775.76s]  Good job.
[8775.76s -> 8776.40s]  Oh, shit.
[8776.40s -> 8778.96s]  I even said that you hit the first funny part.
[8778.96s -> 8779.60s]  Dude.
[8779.60s -> 8780.32s]  Are you moving this?
[8786.35s -> 8787.95s]  I gotta turn my game back up.
[8787.95s -> 8792.21s]  What was it at one?
[8792.85s -> 8797.17s]  Dude, are you moving this?
[8798.18s -> 8799.14s]  I'm not moving this.
[8799.14s -> 8799.70s]  Are you sure?
[8799.70s -> 8800.90s]  I- something's fucking weird.
[8801.94s -> 8803.06s]  I'm not moving this.
[8806.21s -> 8807.25s]  All right, get- move.
[8808.99s -> 8809.79s]  I'm not moving.
[8811.92s -> 8813.04s]  Let's go clean the house.
[8818.24s -> 8822.08s]  Why did you have to bring that up here?
[8823.17s -> 8825.25s]  So that you can see what you're doing.
[8825.25s -> 8825.57s]  Thanks.
[8829.78s -> 8832.88s]  That actually is way too bright though, for real.
[8832.88s -> 8833.52s]  Like, get rid of this.
[8837.31s -> 8838.83s]  This isn't as good as Seinfeld.
[8839.47s -> 8840.61s]  Where did that go?
[8841.25s -> 8843.18s]  How are you still holding that?
[8843.90s -> 8845.18s]  You can't take it out of my hand.
[8845.18s -> 8846.14s]  My hands are too strong.
[8846.14s -> 8847.90s]  I have pure titanium grip strength.
[8848.46s -> 8849.26s]  Okay.
[8849.26s -> 8850.06s]  The bathroom's clean.
[8850.62s -> 8852.38s]  No one's ever taken anything from my hand.
[8853.18s -> 8853.82s]  The bathroom's clean.
[8854.78s -> 8855.82s]  My hands are massive.
[8856.54s -> 8857.82s]  They have like hairy knuckles.
[8858.46s -> 8859.42s]  Veins popping out.
[8862.83s -> 8863.15s]  Gross.
[8865.54s -> 8867.86s]  Yeah, but you think it'd be nice to be held by these hands.
[8867.86s -> 8870.18s]  I got veinier hands than you, I guarantee it.
[8870.66s -> 8871.86s]  I'm vascular.
[8871.86s -> 8873.86s]  I have the veiniest hands in the world.
[8873.86s -> 8874.58s]  I swear to God.
[8876.24s -> 8876.88s]  Let's compare.
[8876.88s -> 8877.20s]  Come here.
[8877.20s -> 8877.76s]  Show me your hands.
[8877.76s -> 8878.64s]  Honestly, if- if-
[8879.36s -> 8882.80s]  You would think that I was an old lady if you saw my hands up close.
[8882.80s -> 8884.08s]  That's not vascular.
[8884.08s -> 8885.12s]  That's wrinkly.
[8885.12s -> 8885.76s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[8885.76s -> 8886.40s]  You don't understand.
[8886.96s -> 8889.36s]  Like, my veins pop the fuck out of my hands.
[8894.27s -> 8895.15s]  Okay, you win.
[8896.03s -> 8898.32s]  We should compare hands.
[8899.04s -> 8910.85s]  I mean, it's the music that's doing it to me too.
[8911.49s -> 8912.13s]  Show hands.
[8913.54s -> 8914.82s]  Are you- are you on camera?
[8914.82s -> 8915.78s]  Are you like decent right now?
[8916.77s -> 8918.45s]  My camera isn't plugged in.
[8918.45s -> 8921.17s]  Well, they're not that vein-y right now.
[8921.17s -> 8921.81s]  They kind of are.
[8922.37s -> 8924.08s]  Should I prove it?
[8926.58s -> 8926.98s]  Prove it.
[8926.98s -> 8927.38s]  Prove it.
[8928.02s -> 8929.81s]  Prove how veinier your hand is.
[8929.81s -> 8930.93s]  I'm opening the stream.
[8930.93s -> 8931.89s]  I need to see.
[8931.89s -> 8932.21s]  Prove it.
[8932.21s -> 8933.57s]  Let's get vein in that.
[8933.57s -> 8934.05s]  Yeah, I know.
[8934.05s -> 8935.57s]  I'm wearing the same shirt as I was yesterday.
[8935.57s -> 8935.97s]  Deal with it.
[8935.97s -> 8936.61s]  It's 100 degrees.
[8938.43s -> 8938.67s]  Wait.
[8939.23s -> 8942.03s]  It being 100 degrees is why you're wearing the same shirt.
[8942.59s -> 8943.07s]  Look at that.
[8943.63s -> 8945.46s]  Look at those.
[8945.46s -> 8945.86s]  Look at that.
[8946.50s -> 8948.16s]  Are you shitting me, dude?
[8948.72s -> 8952.43s]  Can I get a light on that?
[8952.43s -> 8953.07s]  Get a light on it.
[8955.20s -> 8956.56s]  No, you're not- hold on.
[8957.36s -> 8958.00s]  You turn the light.
[8958.00s -> 8959.68s]  You turn- you got the wrong side.
[8960.40s -> 8960.80s]  No, no, no.
[8960.80s -> 8961.52s]  That's towards you.
[8962.24s -> 8962.72s]  Towards me.
[8965.36s -> 8966.88s]  Not in my fucking eyes.
[8967.68s -> 8968.67s]  Okay.
[8969.31s -> 8969.71s]  Can you see?
[8971.18s -> 8971.42s]  Yeah.
[8972.54s -> 8973.90s]  No, my hands are way bigger.
[8974.62s -> 8975.74s]  Like hairier.
[8977.06s -> 8977.94s]  More defined.
[8977.94s -> 8978.98s]  And more vascular.
[8979.62s -> 8980.74s]  And thank you.
[8980.74s -> 8982.26s]  Put the fucking light down, dick.
[8982.26s -> 8984.10s]  Like you still- it's right in my face.
[8985.71s -> 8986.59s]  Never letting go of it.
[8986.59s -> 8987.31s]  Asshole.
[8987.31s -> 8988.35s]  You can't get inside of my hands.
[8988.35s -> 8989.63s]  Not with trickery.
[8989.63s -> 8991.07s]  Not with force.
[8991.07s -> 8992.43s]  Ooh, that was an explosion.
[8994.40s -> 8995.92s]  Oh, is that my switch that went all the way down?
[8995.92s -> 8996.40s]  No, it's not.
[8996.40s -> 8996.88s]  Thank God.
[8996.88s -> 8997.92s]  I was supposed to be fucking sad.
[8997.92s -> 8998.56s]  Look at those hands.
[9000.00s -> 9005.47s]  Wait a second.
[9006.11s -> 9007.39s]  Are you moving this?
[9008.11s -> 9009.07s]  I'm not moving that.
[9009.71s -> 9012.90s]  What about now?
[9013.54s -> 9014.82s]  Are you moving this?
[9014.82s -> 9015.46s]  No, you are.
[9016.34s -> 9020.29s]  Can you get me- can you get me out of the bathroom, please?
[9020.85s -> 9021.57s]  I'm not moving that.
[9022.21s -> 9022.85s]  I'm not moving it.
[9022.85s -> 9023.65s]  Get me out of the bathroom.
[9024.29s -> 9030.00s]  I get you to wipe your ass.
[9032.58s -> 9033.38s]  We're almost done.
[9033.38s -> 9036.42s]  We're at the finish line and we're wiping each other's asses.
[9039.97s -> 9040.29s]  All right.
[9041.41s -> 9046.91s]  I've reached the level of like we're so close to being done
[9046.91s -> 9050.11s]  that it- we can't finish because we're so close.
[9051.15s -> 9052.11s]  That's why we can't finish.
[9052.11s -> 9052.99s]  What is this?
[9053.95s -> 9056.62s]  We still have that whole other house.
[9056.62s -> 9057.26s]  What is this?
[9058.06s -> 9059.50s]  Oh, scary.
[9060.14s -> 9062.46s]  Yeah, there's a home of the house here, right?
[9062.46s -> 9067.79s]  Is that a book?
[9067.79s -> 9075.79s]  All right, I cleaned up the book.
[9076.94s -> 9078.14s]  All right, this is the house.
[9078.14s -> 9079.02s]  Let's do a walkthrough.
[9079.66s -> 9080.96s]  Come with me.
[9081.60s -> 9082.72s]  Bring the ghost light.
[9082.72s -> 9084.16s]  Why do I have to come like-
[9084.96s -> 9087.36s]  Because we're having a fun time in the game together
[9087.36s -> 9088.00s]  and you need to find-
[9088.00s -> 9090.72s]  I'm having so much fun.
[9090.72s -> 9092.24s]  You fucking guys are so bad at this game.
[9092.24s -> 9093.44s]  Well, hey, I'm missing dinner now.
[9097.23s -> 9097.79s]  Calm down.
[9097.79s -> 9098.43s]  Okay, walkthrough.
[9099.07s -> 9104.37s]  There's a USB here.
[9104.37s -> 9105.09s]  Yeah, pick it up.
[9106.64s -> 9107.76s]  There's a couple of these-
[9109.36s -> 9111.68s]  There's a couple of mobile toilets in the bathroom.
[9112.32s -> 9114.96s]  Let me get these mobile toilets out.
[9117.66s -> 9126.42s]  Looks good.
[9126.42s -> 9128.94s]  I'll put this pumpkin here.
[9128.94s -> 9129.58s]  Looks good.
[9131.62s -> 9133.94s]  Ah, excuse me.
[9136.22s -> 9137.02s]  Not done.
[9141.44s -> 9142.48s]  I never saw the attic
[9142.48s -> 9144.16s]  because you had to do the Ouija board thing.
[9144.80s -> 9145.76s]  What Ouija board thing?
[9146.56s -> 9150.00s]  I don't know.
[9150.00s -> 9150.64s]  I don't remember.
[9151.20s -> 9153.66s]  And you brought trash up here, too.
[9154.38s -> 9167.84s]  All right, what would it take me to drink trash juice?
[9174.75s -> 9175.23s]  Wait, what?
[9175.23s -> 9176.59s]  You're not even going to give me a response to that one.
[9176.59s -> 9176.91s]  Come here.
[9177.55s -> 9183.62s]  Well, I'm paying attention.
[9184.34s -> 9185.89s]  Sorry.
[9185.89s -> 9196.18s]  Okay, the attic.
[9196.18s -> 9196.74s]  Did you see the attic?
[9196.74s -> 9197.38s]  It's pretty crazy.
[9197.94s -> 9207.31s]  Why did you bring this upstairs?
[9207.31s -> 9208.59s]  Getting it out of such a pain in the ass.
[9210.11s -> 9212.11s]  You brought the trash all the way up the stairs.
[9212.99s -> 9216.48s]  Jarma.
[9216.48s -> 9217.44s]  Jarma.
[9217.44s -> 9217.76s]  Yes.
[9218.40s -> 9219.36s]  There's been a murder.
[9220.08s -> 9220.72s]  What murder?
[9220.72s -> 9221.20s]  Where?
[9221.20s -> 9224.08s]  I don't think this house is as normal as it seems.
[9224.96s -> 9227.07s]  There's been a murder.
[9229.66s -> 9230.46s]  No shit.
[9230.46s -> 9231.82s]  There's like 30 dead people here.
[9234.13s -> 9234.61s]  What are you trying-
[9234.61s -> 9235.65s]  What's going on here?
[9235.65s -> 9239.01s]  You're just putting splats all over the ceiling and the wall and stuff.
[9239.57s -> 9240.05s]  Hello?
[9240.61s -> 9241.94s]  Did you hear that?
[9243.58s -> 9245.02s]  I think maybe he's still alive.
[9248.14s -> 9249.50s]  I think that's coming from the attic.
[9249.50s -> 9250.06s]  Hello?
[9250.06s -> 9251.02s]  It's coming from the attic.
[9251.02s -> 9251.26s]  Okay.
[9252.22s -> 9253.30s]  Where's the attic?
[9254.67s -> 9255.63s]  It's in here.
[9255.63s -> 9256.59s]  This is the attic up here?
[9257.31s -> 9258.67s]  No, wrong room.
[9258.67s -> 9259.55s]  It's coming from over there.
[9259.55s -> 9259.95s]  Hello?
[9259.95s -> 9260.75s]  Over here?
[9260.75s -> 9261.31s]  I hear it.
[9261.31s -> 9261.71s]  Up here.
[9262.51s -> 9263.60s]  I hear it.
[9263.60s -> 9263.84s]  Is it-
[9265.28s -> 9265.68s]  Get a camera.
[9265.68s -> 9266.32s]  Get a camera up.
[9269.78s -> 9270.74s]  What's in here?
[9270.74s -> 9271.62s]  This is fucked up though.
[9272.34s -> 9278.06s]  Anybody here?
[9281.54s -> 9281.78s]  All right.
[9282.50s -> 9283.30s]  All right, Dave.
[9283.30s -> 9284.34s]  No more fucking around.
[9284.34s -> 9285.46s]  Like you're messing around with me.
[9288.75s -> 9290.19s]  Okay, real funny, Dave.
[9292.16s -> 9293.28s]  Like, haha, got me.
[9296.19s -> 9297.30s]  Hello?
[9297.30s -> 9297.70s]  Hello?
[9299.86s -> 9300.58s]  No, you are.
[9301.14s -> 9303.39s]  Well, I'm gonna get rid of this.
[9303.39s -> 9305.70s]  I can't.
[9305.70s -> 9306.26s]  I need a bucket.
[9306.98s -> 9308.19s]  Hey, Dave.
[9310.13s -> 9312.29s]  Yo, it's time to go, man.
[9313.41s -> 9316.18s]  What are you doing?
[9318.08s -> 9319.12s]  Look at this mess.
[9319.84s -> 9331.76s]  You know, you're just adding more time than we have to be in this map.
[9333.20s -> 9334.24s]  We have to.
[9334.24s -> 9335.04s]  Not let-
[9335.04s -> 9337.68s]  You think that we're gonna leave without cleaning this up?
[9339.90s -> 9341.90s]  I think I'm fully capable of it.
[9341.90s -> 9342.40s]  No!
[9343.58s -> 9344.46s]  I think I could just-
[9344.46s -> 9345.26s]  No, no, no.
[9345.26s -> 9345.74s]  You can't.
[9345.74s -> 9346.38s]  Because that-
[9346.38s -> 9347.74s]  I'm in your game.
[9347.74s -> 9348.38s]  No, no, no, no.
[9348.38s -> 9348.94s]  It was done.
[9348.94s -> 9349.34s]  It was done.
[9349.34s -> 9350.06s]  And we could have clocked out.
[9350.06s -> 9351.50s]  I mean, neither of us cleaned it.
[9351.50s -> 9353.58s]  All right, well, just at least get the USBs.
[9353.58s -> 9357.78s]  Where'd you put them?
[9357.78s -> 9359.30s]  I'm not playing games with you.
[9359.30s -> 9360.26s]  Where are-
[9360.26s -> 9361.46s]  Where are the USBs?
[9361.46s -> 9363.06s]  I'm not playing games with you.
[9363.06s -> 9363.86s]  Turn in the USBs.
[9365.04s -> 9367.63s]  I think I saw them over here.
[9367.63s -> 9368.75s]  At least turn those in for me.
[9373.92s -> 9375.12s]  Come out the house.
[9375.12s -> 9375.84s]  Where are they?
[9379.65s -> 9380.45s]  Where are you?
[9380.45s -> 9386.42s]  I'm not playing games with you.
[9386.42s -> 9390.53s]  Huh? Hello?
[9394.98s -> 9396.50s]  Okay, man.
[9399.10s -> 9403.34s]  I'm gonna just hang out for a bit and maybe I'll talk to you some other time, man.
[9403.34s -> 9403.98s]  But I've gotta-
[9403.98s -> 9404.78s]  I've gotta go.
[9405.82s -> 9406.62s]  The fuck?
[9409.15s -> 9409.87s]  No, you are.
[9414.32s -> 9415.04s]  Hey, rookie!
[9417.07s -> 9418.45s]  Rookie, what?
[9418.45s -> 9420.21s]  I thought you were gonna keep doing the demon thing.
[9420.21s -> 9421.81s]  Nice fucking RP ruin.
[9421.81s -> 9422.37s]  What?
[9422.37s -> 9423.33s]  I wasn't doing a demon thing.
[9423.33s -> 9425.17s]  Nice ruined RP.
[9425.17s -> 9427.25s]  I wasn't doing a demon thing, Jerma.
[9428.66s -> 9431.38s]  It's coming from inside the house.
[9435.01s -> 9436.13s]  Is it coming from the toilet?
[9437.65s -> 9438.53s]  Is he in the bath?
[9447.22s -> 9448.66s]  Is he currently taking a bath?
[9450.02s -> 9450.34s]  All right.
[9451.38s -> 9454.42s]  Can I get in the bathroom, please?
[9458.08s -> 9460.75s]  Excuse me.
[9471.90s -> 9472.78s]  Game six. Oh, fuck.
[9475.22s -> 9476.10s]  What do you want from us?
[9476.74s -> 9489.28s]  I want my house clean and you're gonna fuck it up.
[9489.28s -> 9493.76s]  I mean, we're just trying to entertain some people and make them laugh.
[9495.63s -> 9499.15s]  You were hired for a job and you're goofing around.
[9499.15s -> 9499.95s]  I mean-
[9499.95s -> 9503.18s]  I'd have an ear to take this up with you.
[9503.18s -> 9504.22s]  No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.
[9504.22s -> 9505.42s]  I don't want to get-
[9507.65s -> 9510.05s]  When was this last time you wanted to be written up?
[9510.05s -> 9511.17s]  You've been written up before, huh?
[9512.05s -> 9514.05s]  Once, but it was for something unrelated.
[9514.05s -> 9515.41s]  But you don't have to do that.
[9515.41s -> 9516.45s]  When do you want it done?
[9516.45s -> 9517.49s]  I'll get my colleague on it.
[9517.49s -> 9519.41s]  We'll make sure they get it cleaned.
[9519.49s -> 9521.25s]  Twenty more minutes.
[9521.25s -> 9521.81s]  Twenty minutes?
[9521.81s -> 9524.82s]  Or I will call your manager.
[9524.82s -> 9525.30s]  Twenty minutes?
[9525.30s -> 9526.26s]  No, that's uh-
[9526.26s -> 9527.94s]  Twenty minutes, that's enough time.
[9527.94s -> 9529.22s]  No, that's more than enough time.
[9529.22s -> 9529.72s]  Do it.
[9530.74s -> 9532.10s]  No, we'll get it on top of that.
[9532.10s -> 9533.22s]  We'll do it in twenty minutes.
[9533.78s -> 9536.02s]  Be gone, you little piece of-
[9538.02s -> 9538.50s]  Shitty-
[9539.14s -> 9542.06s]  Okay.
[9543.20s -> 9543.92s]  Yes, we will.
[9545.98s -> 9547.74s]  We will get it done in twenty minutes.
[9551.84s -> 9552.32s]  I'll try.
[9552.96s -> 9553.92s]  Hey, Jerma!
[9554.40s -> 9556.24s]  Hey, I need you up here.
[9556.24s -> 9560.00s]  I need you to get the job done quicker than we thought originally.
[9561.84s -> 9562.16s]  Okay.
[9563.12s -> 9564.96s]  Okay, well I'm fired up.
[9564.96s -> 9565.76s]  I'm ready to go.
[9565.76s -> 9567.44s]  I'm so excited to clean.
[9567.44s -> 9568.40s]  Yeah, no, for real though.
[9568.40s -> 9569.44s]  We have to get this done quickly
[9569.44s -> 9573.44s]  because our boss was going to write us up if we didn't.
[9574.64s -> 9575.52s]  Oh, what's-
[9575.52s -> 9576.16s]  Like, I quit.
[9577.18s -> 9577.68s]  What?
[9578.22s -> 9579.02s]  I quit.
[9579.02s -> 9579.58s]  What do you mean you quit?
[9579.58s -> 9580.62s]  What are you talking about?
[9580.62s -> 9583.90s]  I'm not going to get written up by that shithead.
[9583.90s -> 9584.46s]  No, dude.
[9584.46s -> 9586.70s]  That balding middle-aged piece of trash.
[9586.70s -> 9587.42s]  I don't think you understand.
[9587.42s -> 9588.54s]  Can't even please his wife.
[9591.98s -> 9593.74s]  I'm sorry that you don't get this.
[9593.74s -> 9595.90s]  Yeah, I saw his computer open the other day.
[9595.90s -> 9599.98s]  Like, the weirdest Craigslist wanted ads I've ever read.
[9599.98s -> 9602.14s]  Let's just turn on my stream.
[9602.14s -> 9602.94s]  Turn on my stream.
[9602.94s -> 9603.98s]  Turn on my stream for a second.
[9603.98s -> 9604.78s]  Turn on my stream for a second.
[9604.78s -> 9605.26s]  Important.
[9605.26s -> 9605.82s]  Turn on my stream.
[9605.82s -> 9606.30s]  Watch my stream.
[9607.26s -> 9609.74s]  We have to get this done in twenty minutes.
[9610.46s -> 9611.02s]  You know what I mean?
[9611.02s -> 9611.82s]  Like, we have to-
[9611.82s -> 9614.66s]  Like, uh-
[9615.62s -> 9616.10s]  Us.
[9616.10s -> 9616.50s]  Ghosts.
[9616.50s -> 9617.54s]  Um, I can't-
[9617.54s -> 9618.66s]  Twenty minutes, man.
[9618.66s -> 9619.62s]  Are you watching?
[9619.62s -> 9620.26s]  Twenty minutes.
[9622.19s -> 9622.91s]  Twenty minutes or-
[9624.99s -> 9625.55s]  I don't-
[9625.55s -> 9626.43s]  Like, I'm watching you.
[9626.43s -> 9629.23s]  Twenty minutes, we're gonna eat the farm.
[9629.23s -> 9630.43s]  We're gonna eat the farm in twenty minutes, dude.
[9630.43s -> 9631.55s]  Fucking just start cleaning now.
[9632.27s -> 9633.79s]  You're just the American psycho.
[9644.00s -> 9647.28s]  He's gonna wipe your neck.
[9654.62s -> 9655.90s]  I didn't do the one finger.
[9655.90s -> 9657.34s]  I did, like, the whole palm.
[9659.10s -> 9660.38s]  He's gonna wipe your neck.
[9660.38s -> 9661.26s]  Oh, no, okay.
[9661.26s -> 9661.90s]  Hey, be careful.
[9661.90s -> 9662.30s]  He's gonna-
[9662.30s -> 9663.10s]  He's gonna go like-
[9664.94s -> 9667.58s]  You gotta get, like, some fucking fry oil on your chin.
[9667.58s -> 9668.38s]  He's gonna wipe off.
[9669.74s -> 9670.70s]  I'm okay with that.
[9683.46s -> 9685.22s]  Okay, so, uh, how do you wanna-
[9685.22s -> 9685.86s]  How do you wanna do this?
[9688.02s -> 9688.74s]  Dude, I don't-
[9688.74s -> 9689.62s]  I don't know.
[9690.82s -> 9691.94s]  What is left to do?
[9691.94s -> 9692.66s]  It's the attic.
[9693.30s -> 9694.42s]  The attic and then-
[9694.42s -> 9694.98s]  The USBs.
[9694.98s -> 9695.70s]  Give me the USBs.
[9696.42s -> 9698.27s]  Stop with this USB.
[9698.27s -> 9698.75s]  I quit.
[9698.75s -> 9699.39s]  I will quit.
[9699.39s -> 9700.59s]  Don't quit.
[9700.59s -> 9703.87s]  Get out here and come out the door with a pumpkin's fall.
[9703.87s -> 9705.47s]  I will destroy you.
[9708.90s -> 9710.18s]  Get out here.
[9710.18s -> 9711.94s]  Do one more USB joke and I am-
[9711.94s -> 9712.74s]  Get out of the-
[9712.74s -> 9714.98s]  Spreading my blood everywhere.
[9714.98s -> 9716.50s]  Get out of the house right now.
[9716.50s -> 9717.00s]  I'm out.
[9718.11s -> 9719.31s]  No, I mean, like, the other side.
[9719.31s -> 9720.35s]  The side with the pumpkin's fall.
[9720.99s -> 9725.63s]  Here, Mo.
[9725.63s -> 9726.19s]  Listen to me.
[9726.19s -> 9726.99s]  Listen to me real good.
[9728.70s -> 9733.34s]  I'm gonna cut myself open and just crawl along the floor.
[9737.09s -> 9738.53s]  Real sicko shit.
[9738.53s -> 9739.25s]  All right.
[9739.25s -> 9739.89s]  How about this?
[9739.89s -> 9740.45s]  I have-
[9740.45s -> 9741.49s]  I have a job for you, okay?
[9742.74s -> 9743.54s]  In this-
[9743.54s -> 9744.42s]  In this house somewhere.
[9745.06s -> 9745.46s]  Somewhere.
[9746.18s -> 9747.70s]  There's a fucking treasure.
[9747.70s -> 9749.14s]  And if you can find this tre-
[9749.14s -> 9751.79s]  If you can find the treasure in-
[9753.90s -> 9754.62s]  20 minutes.
[9755.58s -> 9756.14s]  Then-
[9756.14s -> 9756.86s]  No, less than that.
[9757.50s -> 9758.46s]  Five minutes.
[9758.46s -> 9760.22s]  Then I will give you-
[9761.26s -> 9762.54s]  I will give you a hundred dollars.
[9763.50s -> 9764.46s]  What is the treasure?
[9765.02s -> 9766.38s]  The USBs that I hid.
[9767.26s -> 9768.06s]  Okay.
[9768.06s -> 9770.54s]  Good luck.
[9770.54s -> 9771.42s]  And I have five minutes.
[9771.42s -> 9772.86s]  You have five minutes to make a hundred bucks.
[9773.50s -> 9774.35s]  Okay, chat.
[9774.35s -> 9774.91s]  Where do you put them?
[9775.71s -> 9776.35s]  You can't do that.
[9776.35s -> 9777.31s]  That doesn't work.
[9777.31s -> 9778.19s]  Okay, I can't do that.
[9778.19s -> 9779.07s]  Close your chat right now.
[9779.97s -> 9780.21s]  Okay.
[9780.21s -> 9780.77s]  That's bullshit.
[9780.77s -> 9781.65s]  You know, that's unbelievable.
[9782.29s -> 9782.77s]  He's cheating.
[9783.41s -> 9784.21s]  You have five minutes.
[9784.21s -> 9784.85s]  I'm counting right now.
[9785.49s -> 9787.30s]  I'm looking at the clock.
[9805.20s -> 9805.60s]  Found it.
[9808.02s -> 9809.78s]  That's one USB that's outside.
[9809.78s -> 9812.02s]  Not the, like, 40 that I hid.
[9812.02s -> 9813.70s]  Hundred bucks, please!
[9813.70s -> 9816.10s]  No, I said find the USBs that I hid.
[9816.10s -> 9817.46s]  Not find a USB on the clock.
[9817.46s -> 9818.82s]  You hid it right here.
[9818.82s -> 9821.46s]  No, this is not like an Easter egg hunt for four-year-olds.
[9821.46s -> 9821.78s]  This is-
[9822.74s -> 9823.86s]  No, it's going to be harder than that.
[9824.50s -> 9824.82s]  They don't-
[9824.82s -> 9826.34s]  It wasn't harder than that, though.
[9826.34s -> 9827.22s]  It was right here.
[9827.22s -> 9829.14s]  You thought, like, I would see it in the grass because it's green.
[9830.91s -> 9832.11s]  You only have three more minutes left.
[9833.28s -> 9835.36s]  That is not how quickly time goes by.
[9835.36s -> 9835.92s]  Yes, it is.
[9836.64s -> 9843.22s]  Nothing in there.
[9844.98s -> 9845.48s]  Fuck!
[9848.43s -> 9851.73s]  You'll never catch that money!
[9851.73s -> 9852.61s]  You'll never catch that money!
[9854.30s -> 9862.62s]  What are you going to spend your hundred dollars on?
[9862.62s -> 9863.82s]  You read that.
[9863.82s -> 9864.46s]  You read that.
[9865.42s -> 9869.62s]  All right, well, can you pick those up?
[9870.34s -> 9870.84s]  Hello?
[9872.66s -> 9873.22s]  Can I-
[9873.22s -> 9874.10s]  I don't know where they go.
[9876.34s -> 9878.50s]  They were in one central location.
[9884.66s -> 9886.42s]  Why is there another body in here?
[9887.14s -> 9889.11s]  I don't understand how this is-
[9889.11s -> 9890.00s]  Was he in the attic?
[9890.00s -> 9890.80s]  Hey, Dharma.
[9890.80s -> 9891.30s]  Yes?
[9894.72s -> 9898.32s]  How about I hide the USBs and then you have to go find them?
[9898.32s -> 9899.68s]  Okay, that sounds fun.
[9899.68s -> 9900.72s]  And then it'll be even.
[9901.20s -> 9901.70s]  Sure.
[9902.40s -> 9902.90s]  Okay.
[9903.36s -> 9904.32s]  I want to clarify.
[9904.96s -> 9908.80s]  To find them, you, like, need to, like, pick them up and hold them
[9908.80s -> 9910.32s]  and prove to me that you found them.
[9912.00s -> 9915.57s]  Yeah, where's- you can just- I have a stream going right now.
[9916.61s -> 9917.17s]  Yeah, you do.
[9918.56s -> 9921.36s]  You're gonna have to prove to your stream by holding one of the USBs
[9921.36s -> 9923.20s]  that you find the USBs that I hid.
[9923.20s -> 9923.70s]  Okay.
[9925.20s -> 9925.70s]  Just one.
[9926.40s -> 9928.84s]  Or do I have to find them all?
[9929.57s -> 9931.89s]  You have to find- like, I'm hiding the stash.
[9932.45s -> 9932.95s]  Okay.
[9933.78s -> 9937.06s]  So as long as I find the stash that's in quotes.
[9937.06s -> 9937.56s]  Yeah.
[9937.78s -> 9940.26s]  Yeah, and you can prove that you found it by, like,
[9940.26s -> 9942.66s]  picking it up and showing I have found it.
[9942.66s -> 9944.56s]  Okay.
[9944.56s -> 9945.76s]  Yeah, whatever.
[9945.76s -> 9947.12s]  Like, I'm going to hide or something?
[9947.12s -> 9947.76s]  Do I want me to go-
[9947.76s -> 9949.28s]  You need to- you know what?
[9949.28s -> 9950.48s]  Oh, it's clown on the town list.
[9950.48s -> 9952.40s]  You turn around and count to 15.
[9952.40s -> 9952.90s]  Okay.
[9953.94s -> 9954.98s]  Are you ready?
[9954.98s -> 9955.48s]  Yep.
[9956.58s -> 9957.08s]  One.
[9957.54s -> 9958.04s]  Two.
[9958.50s -> 9959.00s]  Three.
[9959.54s -> 9960.04s]  Four.
[9960.68s -> 9961.18s]  Five.
[9961.72s -> 9962.22s]  Six.
[9962.68s -> 9963.18s]  Seven.
[9963.72s -> 9964.22s]  Eight.
[9964.84s -> 9965.34s]  Nine.
[9965.88s -> 9966.38s]  Ten.
[9966.68s -> 9967.18s]  Eleven.
[9967.72s -> 9968.22s]  Twelve.
[9968.84s -> 9969.34s]  Thirteen.
[9969.96s -> 9970.46s]  Fourteen.
[9971.00s -> 9971.50s]  Fifteen.
[9976.45s -> 9976.95s]  And?
[9977.41s -> 9980.28s]  Good luck.
[9980.28s -> 9981.80s]  You didn't even walk over here.
[9983.43s -> 9983.93s]  I hid them.
[9984.47s -> 9999.22s]  Hold on.
[9999.22s -> 10000.16s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no.
[10000.16s -> 10000.96s]  Nobody move.
[10000.96s -> 10001.92s]  Nobody fucking move.
[10007.92s -> 10008.42s]  Give me one!
[10009.04s -> 10009.54s]  Is it in there?
[10010.56s -> 10011.52s]  It's the stash!
[10011.52s -> 10012.24s]  That's the stash!
[10013.64s -> 10014.14s]  Come on!
[10014.60s -> 10015.96s]  Some one of them had to have fallen off.
[10022.34s -> 10022.84s]  No!
[10023.30s -> 10025.46s]  At least one didn't make the journey.
[10027.51s -> 10030.32s]  Oh, god damn it.
[10031.04s -> 10035.38s]  That was so sad.
[10035.38s -> 10035.88s]  What just happened?
[10037.59s -> 10038.09s]  Okay, so-
[10038.09s -> 10038.59s]  Okay.
[10039.03s -> 10040.48s]  So that's 200.
[10041.70s -> 10043.14s]  There was no monetary bet there.
[10066.52s -> 10067.72s]  As reliable as ever.
[10069.24s -> 10072.00s]  Good old Jerma.
[10072.64s -> 10079.34s]  Hey, Star.
[10080.12s -> 10080.62s]  Yeah?
[10080.68s -> 10085.51s]  Found something.
[10085.51s -> 10086.79s]  That's not a stash.
[10087.43s -> 10088.47s]  There are three here.
[10091.27s -> 10095.91s]  There are three that fell from some portal and made their way in here.
[10096.85s -> 10097.73s]  That's a stash.
[10097.73s -> 10100.13s]  I just put them here so that you wouldn't destroy them.
[10100.13s -> 10101.01s]  Hey, come over this way.
[10101.01s -> 10101.73s]  Hey, come over here.
[10101.73s -> 10103.65s]  That is classified as a stash.
[10104.37s -> 10105.01s]  Over here.
[10105.01s -> 10108.37s]  There's also a stash, but it was the stash.
[10108.37s -> 10108.87s]  Jerma.
[10109.75s -> 10115.11s]  Why am I doing that?
[10115.11s -> 10115.59s]  We need those.
[10115.59s -> 10116.09s]  All right.
[10116.47s -> 10117.83s]  I swear to god.
[10118.39s -> 10121.58s]  Okay, so, um, let's finish up.
[10122.38s -> 10123.26s]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[10123.26s -> 10124.86s]  You've ruined everything.
[10124.86s -> 10125.66s]  You've put-
[10129.21s -> 10130.33s]  You won't stare at this cat.
[10131.37s -> 10132.89s]  This is like a fucking haunted image.
[10132.89s -> 10134.89s]  If you stare at this picture for more than a minute,
[10135.53s -> 10136.97s]  you get haunted for the rest of your life.
[10137.93s -> 10138.57s]  You won't do it.
[10139.37s -> 10141.45s]  Holy shit.
[10141.45s -> 10143.93s]  You're just disrespecting the fucking cat.
[10145.78s -> 10146.10s]  Do it!
[10146.10s -> 10146.66s]  No, no, do it!
[10146.66s -> 10147.16s]  Do it!
[10147.80s -> 10150.04s]  If you stare at a black cat for more than a minute,
[10151.64s -> 10153.64s]  you get bad luck for like five years.
[10153.64s -> 10154.20s]  Will you do it?
[10154.20s -> 10154.70s]  Do it.
[10156.09s -> 10156.97s]  Candyman.
[10156.97s -> 10157.53s]  Candyman.
[10157.53s -> 10158.01s]  Don't do that.
[10158.01s -> 10158.81s]  Don't do that.
[10158.81s -> 10159.45s]  I don't want you to do that.
[10160.01s -> 10162.25s]  I'm not in the same room, therefore I'm not in the same zone.
[10165.95s -> 10167.55s]  Whatever you do, I'm not in that room.
[10168.19s -> 10177.47s]  But I'm looking at it too.
[10190.25s -> 10197.69s]  I can't believe you actually looked at it.
[10199.42s -> 10200.22s]  That was a mistake.
[10201.28s -> 10202.24s]  Shouldn't have done that.
[10208.94s -> 10209.66s]  Are we still on call?
[10212.60s -> 10213.72s]  No, he didn't do the thing.
[10213.72s -> 10214.60s]  He just leaves, right?
[10215.40s -> 10216.97s]  Did he leave?
[10220.17s -> 10221.05s]  He left.
[10221.05s -> 10221.61s]  No, he didn't.
[10222.25s -> 10223.48s]  He's here.
[10224.86s -> 10225.58s]  You can't fool me.
[10225.58s -> 10225.98s]  You're here.
[10228.06s -> 10229.18s]  You can't fool me.
[10229.18s -> 10229.74s]  You're there.
[10229.74s -> 10230.38s]  I know you're there.
[10230.94s -> 10231.66s]  He's gone.
[10231.66s -> 10232.54s]  He ended his stream too.
[10243.40s -> 10244.04s]  God damn it.
[10245.00s -> 10247.48s]  I gave him an out and he took the opportunity.
[10247.48s -> 10250.68s]  He was looking for an opportunity and he found it.
[10258.40s -> 10261.04s]  I should have told him, like, look at it for four hours.
[10261.76s -> 10266.11s]  Well, that was fun.
[10267.07s -> 10269.15s]  That was Star on Twitch.
[10269.87s -> 10272.11s]  He's still streaming.
[10272.11s -> 10272.99s]  He's still streaming.
[10273.71s -> 10277.40s]  What is he doing right now?
[10277.40s -> 10286.12s]  He's offline.
[10286.12s -> 10291.16s]  All right, well, it's supposed to be co-op day.
[10291.88s -> 10296.91s]  I'm like Matrix dodging bullets here.
[10298.09s -> 10299.80s]  Internet sucks.
[10299.80s -> 10301.32s]  Executive assault 2 doesn't work.
[10302.12s -> 10304.20s]  Star looked at the cat picture for more than a minute.
[10304.76s -> 10306.16s]  That's three strikes.
[10306.88s -> 10308.49s]  Time to do tier lists.
[10318.59s -> 10321.05s]  All right, let me just take a break.
[10321.53s -> 10323.85s]  I've been live for about four hours now.
[10324.73s -> 10325.76s]  Maybe more than that.
[10325.76s -> 10327.20s]  The stream turned off like three times.
[10328.78s -> 10330.30s]  I have no idea how long I've been live for.
[10330.30s -> 10331.74s]  It's been probably four or five hours or so.
[10333.00s -> 10336.84s]  But we'll come back.
[10336.84s -> 10337.72s]  We'll do the tier lists.
[10342.68s -> 10344.92s]  And I'll see you in not even three.
[10344.92s -> 10347.88s]  No, the stream turned off like three times.
[10350.04s -> 10351.48s]  How long has it actually been?
[10351.48s -> 10362.64s]  Let me see.
[10370.56s -> 10371.52s]  25 minutes.
[10375.16s -> 10375.64s]  No, let's see.
[10375.64s -> 10377.00s]  How many VODs are there in this stream?
[10378.19s -> 10378.67s]  No, let's see.
[10378.67s -> 10379.87s]  How many VODs are there in this stream?
[10379.87s -> 10380.43s]  Oh, yeah.
[10380.43s -> 10382.83s]  This has been much longer than that.
[10382.83s -> 10383.23s]  Oh, yeah.
[10383.23s -> 10384.59s]  No, this is 20.
[10384.59s -> 10385.39s]  One hour 30.
[10385.39s -> 10386.19s]  Oh, yeah.
[10386.19s -> 10387.63s]  No, this is four hours.
[10387.63s -> 10388.75s]  One hour 30.
[10388.75s -> 10390.67s]  Four hours.
[10390.67s -> 10391.87s]  One hour 30.
[10391.87s -> 10392.91s]  Four hours.
[10392.91s -> 10394.91s]  One hour 30.
[10394.91s -> 10396.11s]  Four hours.
[10396.11s -> 10397.39s]  Star just hosted me.
[10397.39s -> 10398.91s]  Four hours.
[10398.91s -> 10399.87s]  Thank you for that, Star.
[10399.87s -> 10400.59s]  Star just hosted me.
[10402.59s -> 10402.99s]  Oops.
[10403.63s -> 10405.39s]  Oops, oops, whoops.
[10408.06s -> 10408.46s]  Whoops.
[10412.94s -> 10413.98s]  How do I actually turn this up?
[10415.92s -> 10417.12s]  How do I actually turn this up?
[10417.12s -> 10417.84s]  Why is this playing?
[10417.84s -> 10418.64s]  I don't have one window.
[10418.64s -> 10419.28s]  I actually don't have one window.
[10419.28s -> 10420.16s]  How do I actually turn this up?
[10420.16s -> 10420.88s]  Why is this playing?
[10420.88s -> 10421.68s]  I don't have one window.
[10421.68s -> 10422.40s]  I actually don't have one window.
[10422.40s -> 10423.20s]  How do I actually turn this up?
[10423.20s -> 10424.56s]  I'm going to turn, I'm going to turn my light.
[10425.36s -> 10427.04s]  I'm going to turn my capture screen on.
[10428.40s -> 10430.08s]  I'm going to turn my capture screen on.
[10431.44s -> 10433.12s]  I'm going to turn my capture screen on.
[10434.56s -> 10436.16s]  I'm going to turn my capture screen on.
[10458.14s -> 10458.94s]  Oh, there it is.
[10459.58s -> 10461.82s]  Okay, I was on a different, I was on my videos tab
[10462.97s -> 10464.73s]  and it was still playing the stream
[10464.73s -> 10466.73s]  even though I was on the videos tab somehow.
[10468.92s -> 10472.80s]  Okay, I'll be right back.
[10472.80s -> 10474.32s]  I'm going to just go to the bathroom
[10474.32s -> 10475.36s]  and we'll do some stuff.
[10476.00s -> 10477.39s]  See you soon.
