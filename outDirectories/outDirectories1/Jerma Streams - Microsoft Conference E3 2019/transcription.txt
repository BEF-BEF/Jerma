[19.32s -> 27.11s]  Can't wait. You got chat open? I don't, I don't have chat. I don't have chat open.
[27.11s -> 33.18s]  Yeah, cut em! Cut em out! Well, I think, uh, honestly, what, uh, if you want my opinion
[33.18s -> 59.27s]  on that, uh, I think that 2077, no, I don't think so. Uh, well, I don't have a, I don't
[59.27s -> 80.84s]  have one of those things under here. No, they can't. Yeah, definitely. Am I still here?
[80.84s -> 118.71s]  Hello? Can you guys hear me? Oh, there you are. Yeah, just milk. It was nice. Yeah,
[118.71s -> 124.14s]  yeah. I think, I mean, the whole thing with the game is, uh, it takes place in the future, so
[124.14s -> 128.30s]  I just want to know what kind of food they eat in the future. You know what I mean? What's
[128.30s -> 145.21s]  happening to my fucking feed? Hey guys, how you doing? Enable what? I mean, there's no sound.
[145.21s -> 150.54s]  It was muted the whole fucking time! I gotta do the whole thing again. Just relax. I'm,
[150.54s -> 156.89s]  I'm definitely hyped about it, of course, but I'm not at, like, co-levels or, or levels of,
[156.89s -> 163.29s]  of fanboys that I could be, that I am for, say, Bloodlines 2. Like, I'm really excited to
[163.29s -> 168.17s]  see more Bloodlines 2 stuff. I can't wait. That's great stuff. Devolver Conference,
[168.17s -> 171.29s]  I'm super hyped about that, but, like, as far as the cyberpunch it, I'm, I'm,
[171.29s -> 175.29s]  I'm on an even keel for that stuff. Can we swear here? Yeah, yeah. Let's talk about
[175.29s -> 178.97s]  some of the other stuff that we'll see outside of, uh, third party. Let's talk first party
[178.97s -> 183.45s]  for a second. Halo Infinite. I don't think, are, Rami, are you a big Halo fan? Where are
[183.45s -> 187.29s]  you at with the Halo? I'm a big, I'm a Halo fan. I can tell you about it. I, I'm not,
[188.41s -> 192.25s]  you know, I want to be excited about Halo again. I, I haven't, I haven't been in a
[192.25s -> 198.49s]  while. Like, ODST and Reach were sort of like where it ended for me. And even though I really
[198.49s -> 205.21s]  respect Halo 4, um, and, you know, like in, the Halos that have come after have just not,
[205.21s -> 210.17s]  they haven't mentioned, they haven't managed to capture that, that feeling that I had with
[210.17s -> 212.81s]  the early Halo 4. Yeah, like a, like a, like a Pokemon. I don't know, because, like,
[212.81s -> 217.53s]  obviously I've been playing Destiny a lot, and a lot of my love for Halo is in, in Destiny.
[217.53s -> 223.13s]  But I really hope that Halo finds a new identity, right? A new, like, this is Halo,
[223.13s -> 228.09s]  instead of trying to kind of be old Halo and kind of be not old Halo. And I just, I'm just,
[228.65s -> 231.45s]  I want to be excited about Halo. Please give me something to be excited about.
[231.45s -> 234.41s]  That's really what I want. All right. Does this excite you? Does a,
[235.05s -> 242.25s]  FPS's 2019 BR, is a Halo BR? No, no, no BR. BR doesn't excite me at all. I'm sorry,
[242.25s -> 245.21s]  I'm in a hurry to open your butt. Is BR out the window now? Yes, I think so. Do they just
[245.21s -> 248.49s]  go back to what Halo was? I think BR is just the thing that was like League of Legends.
[248.49s -> 252.73s]  I don't, I don't, I really don't care too much. I do. I know this. I know this. Let me answer.
[252.73s -> 256.89s]  I know this. I, I can see it, but I also don't really need it.
[256.89s -> 260.73s]  Chat's definitely not in the VR world as well. So I think that, uh. It's honestly,
[260.73s -> 265.29s]  for me, it's, Halo was always about, like, diagonal shootouts, corridors, throwing grenades,
[265.29s -> 270.09s]  weird physics bugs, like throwing, throwing a warthog over somebody's head with a grenade.
[270.09s -> 273.29s]  Like, that's Halo for me. Right. I don't really need that 100 people.
[273.29s -> 275.53s]  Yeah, yeah. What were you going to say before I interrupted you?
[278.66s -> 281.46s]  You interrupted me! I was going to say something about BR!
[282.58s -> 287.86s]  Yeah, now I remember. Thank you. So basically, it's an interesting situation because with Halo,
[287.86s -> 291.62s]  it's kind of like a Borderlands thing, where it's such an established franchise. You're going
[291.62s -> 296.02s]  to have a fan base, a broad fan base in Halo's situation, where they're going to be
[296.02s -> 300.34s]  expecting kind of the same thing. They want more of what they already love. So it's a
[300.34s -> 305.22s]  very fine line to walk when making a subsequent... I'm always blocking the name, though.
[305.22s -> 309.14s]  Oh, sorry. Where it's kind of like, how much new stuff can you really put in without alienating
[309.14s -> 312.50s]  that already established, very established Halo's case? Just like the end of the presidential
[312.50s -> 316.90s]  debate. Just because I'm like 2% of the poll doesn't mean I get to say anything!
[316.90s -> 320.90s]  We talked about Fable on our pre-show. Are we, do we think that's, I mean,
[320.90s -> 324.26s]  it was listed in the Mixer game directory, also the Twitch game directory. That's what
[324.26s -> 328.58s]  everyone's thinking it's going to be here. Is it time for a new Fable? Is it time to put
[328.58s -> 333.70s]  that game back out there? Fable 3, I think. I mean, is it time for a good new RPG?
[334.74s -> 338.90s]  Is the bigger question. If you frame it that way, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Come on, it's
[338.90s -> 346.50s]  about time. What has been the big RPG? It's been what? The Witcher 3 was the last really
[346.50s -> 350.50s]  big one that kind of made me feel like, oh, wow, here's a big old fantasy RPG.
[351.62s -> 354.90s]  No, no, what do you think? I've heard from CRPGs, yeah. It's been kind of...
[354.90s -> 359.14s]  Well, that type of RPG, right? Yeah. Yeah. All right, I'm done with this.
[360.98s -> 365.70s]  Stop the stream for a second. Welcome. That was a long... how long have I been streaming?
[365.70s -> 369.46s]  Like six minutes? I feel like I was streaming for like four hours already. Is that weird?
[372.38s -> 378.31s]  Oh, you missed the beginning, too. I feel so fucking bad about that. Everyone got silent
[378.31s -> 380.79s]  and I said like, hey, why do I not have one of those things? And they were like,
[380.79s -> 384.23s]  somebody coughed. I can't believe I'm so pissed that it was muted. Anyways, hello.
[385.19s -> 391.35s]  Uh, we're gonna watch the Microsoft E3 conference today. I've made sure to get nice villain hair
[391.35s -> 399.34s]  for you guys. I know you like the villain hair. I did it specifically. You just finished
[399.34s -> 414.31s]  what? How tall am I? Why is my hair receding? Let me get back to the fucking cast. This
[414.31s -> 428.97s]  actually looks kind of... hold on. This is my show now. Right. By the time it gets to E3,
[428.97s -> 432.17s]  obviously you have a good idea of what it is, but some of the games you're gonna see
[432.17s -> 439.13s]  today have absurd history stories, like just ridiculous stories of deals, development problems.
[443.13s -> 450.89s]  It excites me, too. They work so damn hard, you know? They really do. Sorry,
[450.89s -> 453.69s]  I'm like a huge person. I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this. That's why I need
[453.69s -> 458.09s]  so much screen real estate. I'm eight and a half feet tall. There's no webcam. These
[458.09s -> 462.41s]  are four webcams attached in squares. I've edited out the middle. Because Cyberpunk's
[462.41s -> 465.29s]  already there. So that's kind of... Is it? It is already there. You're right. Yeah. Showing
[465.29s -> 471.13s]  Halo off or the new console off? Like what's the big thing that everyone's going to be talking
[471.13s -> 476.33s]  about? If they have the console, it's going to be the console. You think? Like Sony seems
[476.33s -> 480.49s]  convinced that it's the console because they've been talking about there if they clearly want
[480.49s -> 486.97s]  to be ahead. So yeah, I guess we'll see. Zeke, what about you? Are you all in on the
[487.05s -> 491.13s]  indie stuff? Is there any one particular thing here that you're super excited about with the
[491.13s -> 495.37s]  potential to see as we're about five minutes away, six minutes away? What do you think? Well,
[495.37s -> 500.09s]  like last time you cut my legs out before I even had a chance, you're like... And you
[500.09s -> 506.41s]  can't say new IPs because that's always what I'm looking for. That's bullshit. I can't wait
[506.41s -> 511.21s]  for the new console, by the way. To be shown there, whether they're indie or otherwise. But
[511.29s -> 517.29s]  I mean, if you're going for like a long shot outside chance, like, man, Skate 4 would be
[517.29s -> 522.81s]  fucking cool. Oh, well, I would love to not have that released because I hated the third one so
[522.81s -> 526.41s]  much. That would be pretty sweet. Did you happen to see, I think it was, I didn't, maybe
[526.41s -> 530.33s]  Rami read this fully, but Adam Sessler works for like a data company when it comes to what
[530.33s -> 534.73s]  people are excited about. I think Skate 4 was the number one mentioned thing yesterday during
[534.73s -> 539.61s]  all of like social media and chat across all their different platforms. During the EA,
[540.01s -> 545.13s]  not conference, the EA play, sorry, I'll stay on brand. Skate 4 was mentioned more than anything
[545.13s -> 555.45s]  they showed, which is kind of funny. Drinking fermented milk. I look like a dream person.
[556.57s -> 561.37s]  Do I like waking fucked up right now? Look at this. What's wrong with my face?
[562.81s -> 568.97s]  I'm having a mental breakdown. That was pretty hard, man, because like basically Anthem...
[569.05s -> 578.09s]  Look at me. I look like a fucking snake person. Do I look fucking strange or am I Adam? What's
[578.09s -> 583.45s]  wrong with me? And most of it was we need more content as fast as possible. And then months go
[583.45s -> 588.41s]  by. And then at the EA play show, they announced that they have been spending the resources
[588.41s -> 595.05s]  to make a public server to get feedback on the game. And they were like, wow,
[595.05s -> 600.81s]  are we awesome listening to our people? It's kind of like, yeah. Anyways, that's Anthem. We'll be
[600.81s -> 605.05s]  talking about that on our recap. And anyway, I think that it's time for me to talk. Do you
[605.05s -> 610.25s]  think they give any love to the PC side of Xbox here? Do you think they devote any time to...
[610.25s -> 614.49s]  No, they never do. Joe, they never do, Joe. I had a game list earlier today. I think it's
[614.49s -> 619.13s]  10 bucks. One of them including, or one of them being Metro Exodus. They're going to come
[619.21s -> 630.97s]  up with a companion app for Dead Rising 4 that lets you check the map where treasure could be.
[640.28s -> 641.40s]  I didn't even tweet this.
[649.74s -> 653.10s]  Well, like, yeah, they're obviously trying to make this one thing. So I don't think we'll see
[653.10s -> 658.06s]  anything specifically for PC. But oh, yeah, they're going to mention PC like all night.
[659.10s -> 661.98s]  If we don't have PC on the bingo card, there needs to be PC on the bingo card.
[661.98s -> 662.62s]  I don't think they're going to.
[664.38s -> 669.26s]  I mean, to put it in a little bit, you can go right now to the Epic Games store
[669.26s -> 677.34s]  and you can buy Metro Exodus for $49.99. Or you could give Microsoft $5. And as long
[677.34s -> 685.58s]  as you beat it in a month. It's just Gamefly. Joe, it's Gamefly. Gamefly was way before its
[685.58s -> 691.10s]  time. They were the first company that ever thought that was a decent idea and they stole
[691.10s -> 698.39s]  it from them. What do you think is the opener? Do you open or close with the new console?
[698.39s -> 703.11s]  Do you open or close with Halo? Oh, you close with the new console. Last thing you do
[703.11s -> 706.87s]  is you say, and one more thing. And they walk off stage in the trailer please behind you.
[706.87s -> 710.87s]  It's going to be like in the first few minutes and they're going to start off with a game
[711.51s -> 716.46s]  that shows off what it can do. It's going to be one image too.
[716.46s -> 718.46s]  Joe, it's going to be one image. That's it.
[720.46s -> 724.54s]  Real quick, by the way, apparently it's one dollar during the beta phase to.
[724.54s -> 725.42s]  Am I allowed to do this?
[726.78s -> 729.90s]  They are trying to get some early adoption rate going over.
[729.90s -> 731.50s]  Why? What do you mean?
[731.50s -> 735.58s]  My seems kind of okay. Anyway, what was the question?
[736.46s -> 737.58s]  Am I not allowed to be doing this?
[737.58s -> 739.34s]  In a minute 40, a minute 30.
[739.34s -> 741.34s]  Probably be the standard montage.
[741.34s -> 743.42s]  I'm pretending to be on their podcast.
[744.78s -> 747.02s]  I'm not on their podcast right now. I'm just stricken.
[747.02s -> 750.62s]  I would guess Game Pass. I would probably guess Game Pass and then right into their
[750.62s -> 754.86s]  establishments, which would be like Halo and then maybe some other stuff. They may
[754.86s -> 756.86s]  open with teasers though, which could be really interesting.
[756.86s -> 757.42s]  That's true.
[757.42s -> 760.54s]  Like here's a quick snap of something that you'll see later in the show.
[761.18s -> 763.58s]  Look at how bad my head looks from this. I'm not even going to show you.
[764.14s -> 766.46s]  I look fucking all right here. I look like stretched out man.
[767.90s -> 770.06s]  Zeke, what are your predictions? What are we seeing first here?
[772.71s -> 773.67s]  Ignoring the bingo.
[774.39s -> 774.87s]  Something surprising.
[774.87s -> 775.83s]  Is it bingo?
[775.83s -> 778.95s]  Like a surprise like that no one that might not have gotten leaked.
[778.95s -> 779.27s]  The one thing-
[779.27s -> 781.11s]  I wanted to bingo, but it's too much to pay attention to.
[781.11s -> 781.99s]  Exactly. Exactly.
[781.99s -> 786.23s]  They're going to open with like, hey, Xbox dildo coming right at you.
[786.23s -> 787.03s]  It's like, whoa, what?
[789.03s -> 790.07s]  Can't say that on TV.
[790.07s -> 793.19s]  They've taken the timer off. For everyone that's over at slash
[793.19s -> 796.15s]  Twitch. I think we're going to get shut up over there.
[796.15s -> 796.71s]  Oh, I'm ready.
[796.71s -> 798.79s]  Join us. We're going to be talking over the conference here
[798.79s -> 801.99s]  at that twitch.tv slash at mejp and we'll be back after-
[801.99s -> 802.71s]  Go stay here.
[803.67s -> 804.87s]  Stay on my stream.
[804.87s -> 806.63s]  Here any second. I'm going to go ahead and kick it over.
[806.63s -> 809.19s]  Bingo, bingo, bingo. I don't have enough time to do a bingo.
[810.31s -> 811.75s]  What the fuck is this bingo card?
[813.75s -> 814.23s]  Hold on.
[814.23s -> 815.35s]  It's true. It's true.
[815.35s -> 816.23s]  Annoying.
[816.23s -> 818.23s]  Jerma hyped for From Software.
[818.23s -> 819.43s]  Minecraft.
[819.43s -> 821.27s]  Jerma's a sellout because he likes something.
[821.27s -> 822.07s]  Make sure you watch-
[822.07s -> 823.43s]  I don't even have things set up for this.
[827.27s -> 827.83s]  Oh my god.
[829.51s -> 830.63s]  My screen just went down.
[833.59s -> 833.99s]  Fuck it.
[833.99s -> 835.35s]  Mike, Windows 10.
[835.35s -> 836.63s]  Why did everything just fall down?
[838.04s -> 838.92s]  Okay, I don't have time.
[838.92s -> 839.40s]  I can't do it.
[839.40s -> 839.88s]  I'm sorry.
[839.88s -> 840.60s]  I got to be quiet.
[841.40s -> 841.88s]  Who's this?
[843.32s -> 844.76s]  Wait, why are we all here?
[845.72s -> 846.12s]  Hold on.
[846.12s -> 847.16s]  Am I missing something?
[847.16s -> 849.40s]  Why are we all in boxes down here?
[849.96s -> 851.08s]  Are they going to add everybody?
[852.04s -> 853.88s]  I don't-
[853.88s -> 855.16s]  Am I on the wrong channel?
[858.44s -> 859.64s]  Wait, is this a visual?
[862.74s -> 863.86s]  How do I get it-
[863.86s -> 865.30s]  How do I get on a different show?
[866.42s -> 867.94s]  I'm on the wrong stream.
[869.14s -> 869.86s]  No, I'm not.
[876.12s -> 876.60s]  They've left me.
[876.60s -> 877.00s]  They left me.
[877.00s -> 877.40s]  They left me.
[878.12s -> 881.70s]  No, this is right.
[882.26s -> 890.84s]  This is like turned up all the way.
[891.48s -> 893.08s]  Am I going to be bigger than this?
[893.88s -> 895.72s]  Oh, this is my favorite part of a former Marvel movie.
[896.28s -> 897.96s]  When it shows everything, it like says Marvel.
[898.60s -> 918.87s]  I bet they show Forts of 12.
[921.46s -> 922.90s]  Xbox Game Studios.
[923.54s -> 924.34s]  Please welcome.
[936.12s -> 938.20s]  Marvel is the oldest and most efficient-
[938.20s -> 939.16s]  I didn't try to shut up.
[939.16s -> 940.76s]  ...history has ever shown us.
[942.20s -> 945.77s]  Scheduled scarcity is a premium feature of colonial life.
[946.97s -> 948.89s]  A colony must never lose faith.
[948.89s -> 950.49s]  That is what the board provides.
[950.49s -> 953.05s]  Security in a senseless and chaotic world.
[955.94s -> 959.30s]  This is Halcyon, the furthest colony in the galaxy.
[960.02s -> 962.42s]  Proudly owned and operated by corporations.
[964.02s -> 965.22s]  Everything we have.
[966.26s -> 967.06s]  Everything we are.
[968.02s -> 969.38s]  We owe to them.
[970.02s -> 970.50s]  Who's here?
[972.55s -> 973.35s]  All right, this is the-
[973.35s -> 974.07s]  This is the outer-
[974.07s -> 975.75s]  They're always with us.
[975.75s -> 976.47s]  The outside.
[976.47s -> 977.03s]  Whatever it's called.
[977.03s -> 978.47s]  No one has ever gone against them.
[979.67s -> 987.24s]  A stranger has just arrived.
[989.00s -> 991.24s]  Someone who's challenging the corporate board.
[992.84s -> 995.00s]  Someone who's digging up their secrets.
[1000.55s -> 1002.71s]  Someone who could be a villain.
[1004.15s -> 1005.35s]  Or a hero.
[1005.35s -> 1007.03s]  Looks like the bleeding stopped.
[1007.03s -> 1007.99s]  I owe you one.
[1007.99s -> 1008.39s]  Here.
[1008.39s -> 1010.47s]  Hope this gun serves you better than it did me.
[1011.75s -> 1013.27s]  Or a psychopath.
[1013.27s -> 1013.77s]  Oh.
[1027.98s -> 1029.74s]  Classic German joke.
[1030.62s -> 1035.16s]  I suppose time will tell.
[1035.16s -> 1037.96s]  But no matter who this stranger chooses to be.
[1038.68s -> 1042.38s]  The Halcyon colony will never be the same.
[1042.38s -> 1043.34s]  Yeah, this is the outer-
[1043.34s -> 1044.86s]  What's it- whatever it's called.
[1044.86s -> 1045.98s]  Yeah, see? I told you.
[1047.26s -> 1049.35s]  You don't know what I'm talking about.
[1060.30s -> 1060.94s]  Outer Worlds.
[1061.50s -> 1067.32s]  All right.
[1071.10s -> 1073.26s]  I took pregnancy classes just for this moment.
[1075.53s -> 1076.17s]  Come on, Phil.
[1076.17s -> 1077.69s]  Please welcome from Ninja Theory,
[1077.69s -> 1080.65s]  Rami Tucker and Dom Matthews.
[1080.65s -> 1084.01s]  Let's see what they have to say.
[1089.70s -> 1091.78s]  God, I wish I was in that audience right now.
[1091.78s -> 1092.34s]  Screaming.
[1092.34s -> 1097.70s]  At E3 2018, we announced that Ninja Theory had joined Xbox Game Studios.
[1098.34s -> 1100.82s]  A move that has given us an incredible boost
[1100.82s -> 1103.06s]  in achieving the creative ambition of our teams.
[1104.02s -> 1107.38s]  We've started work on a number of new games at the studio.
[1107.38s -> 1111.62s]  And in the near future, we'll be sharing details on all of these projects.
[1111.62s -> 1113.22s]  I need a fucking coffee so bad.
[1113.22s -> 1115.06s]  When we joined Xbox Game Studios,
[1115.06s -> 1119.62s]  we already had a very exciting game several years in the making.
[1119.62s -> 1119.94s]  Oh.
[1119.94s -> 1123.22s]  And we're happy to return to E3 to share this with you.
[1124.82s -> 1127.78s]  As creative director, I'm stoked to be here
[1127.78s -> 1129.46s]  to share a new game with you guys.
[1130.18s -> 1132.66s]  It combines two of my gaming passions.
[1132.74s -> 1136.50s]  Third-person action combat and competitive team multiplayer.
[1137.38s -> 1140.58s]  Our technical alpha is kicking off in just a couple of weeks.
[1140.58s -> 1141.54s]  And card games.
[1141.54s -> 1142.90s]  And we'd love for you to sign up, get involved,
[1142.90s -> 1144.34s]  and tell us what you think.
[1144.34s -> 1147.70s]  Or if you're here at E3, come and join us for a game.
[1147.70s -> 1149.46s]  It's my two favorite things.
[1149.46s -> 1151.78s]  Card games and microtransactions.
[1151.78s -> 1153.46s]  This is Bleeding Edge.
[1153.46s -> 1154.42s]  It's my favorite thing.
[1155.38s -> 1159.59s]  All right, all right.
[1159.59s -> 1160.15s]  I'll shut up.
[1160.87s -> 1168.62s]  Oh, it's the Outer Worlds.
[1169.34s -> 1170.06s]  It's the Outer Worlds.
[1170.94s -> 1173.93s]  Oh, they're showing more Outer Worlds.
[1174.90s -> 1175.62s]  Nice.
[1175.62s -> 1198.79s]  Can we just turn into a motorcycle?
[1224.31s -> 1227.27s]  Technical Alpha starts on June 27th.
[1227.83s -> 1234.62s]  Technical Alpha.
[1234.62s -> 1237.26s]  I'm not sure you'd want to...
[1238.86s -> 1240.78s]  We're getting earlier and earlier
[1240.78s -> 1242.30s]  when you start to let people play your game.
[1242.86s -> 1244.60s]  Does that mean that there's like sounds?
[1245.64s -> 1246.92s]  There's no sounds in that game.
[1249.18s -> 1284.30s]  Did they show this last year?
[1284.30s -> 1284.94s]  I feel like they did.
[1285.74s -> 1287.02s]  Or like the Game Awards or something.
[1287.82s -> 1326.84s]  I can't wait.
[1326.84s -> 1345.58s]  A big three in a row.
[1345.58s -> 1346.22s]  Oh my god.
[1347.03s -> 1347.59s]  See you in a minute.
[1362.86s -> 1365.42s]  Minecraft version 2.12.
[1367.16s -> 1368.76s]  This chapter in the game now.
[1373.37s -> 1374.25s]  What is this?
[1374.25s -> 1381.77s]  This is a pretty big update for Minecraft.
[1381.77s -> 1385.91s]  This is Diablo Immortal.
[1386.79s -> 1390.63s]  This is Minecraft Diablo.
[1390.63s -> 1403.32s]  This is gonna sell like a trillion copies.
[1403.32s -> 1403.80s]  You know it.
[1405.00s -> 1418.86s]  Well, you know, it's really sad when
[1418.86s -> 1421.02s]  probably the best action RPG to come out
[1422.76s -> 1425.00s]  in probably two or three plus years
[1425.00s -> 1426.36s]  is Minecraft spinoff.
[1433.66s -> 1434.62s]  I'm excited for that.
[1434.62s -> 1435.42s]  That sucks.
[1435.42s -> 1436.30s]  I'm excited for that.
[1436.30s -> 1437.02s]  I am.
[1437.02s -> 1438.06s]  I want to play that.
[1438.06s -> 1438.54s]  I like that.
[1438.54s -> 1439.50s]  I don't even like Minecraft,
[1439.50s -> 1440.30s]  but like I've all like...
[1441.50s -> 1442.06s]  Here he is.
[1442.86s -> 1443.74s]  I'm excited for that.
[1443.74s -> 1444.30s]  I actually am.
[1444.30s -> 1446.30s]  Like I think that'll be fun to play for like an hour.
[1447.10s -> 1447.58s]  There he is.
[1448.62s -> 1449.75s]  Come on.
[1449.75s -> 1450.39s]  Come on, Phil.
[1450.39s -> 1453.11s]  I've been drinking kefir all morning waiting for you.
[1453.99s -> 1471.43s]  Somebody just...
[1475.96s -> 1477.88s]  Live for this exact moment.
[1477.88s -> 1484.17s]  We get to share the best of our art form
[1484.17s -> 1485.69s]  here with you in LA.
[1486.65s -> 1491.21s]  And the moment you get to experience breathtaking new stories,
[1491.21s -> 1494.97s]  new worlds, and new heroes for the very first time.
[1496.44s -> 1499.48s]  Man, it's pretty sick that we're the only fucking people here.
[1500.60s -> 1502.52s]  So even if you have bad magic tricks,
[1502.52s -> 1505.11s]  you're the only magician in the room.
[1505.11s -> 1508.87s]  This decisive moment of discovery is etched
[1508.87s -> 1512.63s]  in your gaming history alongside your every achievement,
[1513.51s -> 1514.39s]  your every moment,
[1515.27s -> 1516.39s]  your every new friend.
[1517.43s -> 1521.67s]  This is why we on Team Xbox are always
[1522.39s -> 1525.59s]  and will be dedicated to unleashing the next
[1525.59s -> 1528.31s]  new games for you to discover and love.
[1529.19s -> 1529.99s]  Show us.
[1529.99s -> 1531.99s]  So whether you're one of the thousands with us
[1531.99s -> 1533.19s]  here in Microsoft Theater...
[1538.15s -> 1539.27s]  That like hurt my jaw.
[1539.27s -> 1541.83s]  ...one of the billions around the world who play games...
[1541.83s -> 1543.43s]  There were billions of people watching this stream.
[1543.43s -> 1544.55s]  ...welcome to E3 2019.
[1545.35s -> 1546.79s]  This is all, this is loud as I can go.
[1549.83s -> 1554.23s]  This right now is the single most creative
[1554.23s -> 1557.03s]  and energizing time in gaming history.
[1558.47s -> 1559.19s]  Games and games together...
[1559.19s -> 1559.99s]  That's my son?
[1561.27s -> 1562.71s]  Phil Spencer's dad is here.
[1563.59s -> 1566.71s]  ...to be a significant unifying force for the world.
[1568.33s -> 1569.21s]  The expanding...
[1569.21s -> 1570.33s]  That guy's getting thrown out.
[1570.33s -> 1574.09s]  ...has opened a new era of creative possibility.
[1574.09s -> 1577.05s]  With more games, more creators,
[1577.05s -> 1579.53s]  and more industry players than ever before.
[1580.41s -> 1583.13s]  And gamers were everywhere.
[1583.13s -> 1584.97s]  Somebody just walked up and was like...
[1584.97s -> 1586.25s]  Shh, can you stop doing that please?
[1586.25s -> 1588.65s]  ...players in the world has more than tripled.
[1589.53s -> 1592.89s]  Over two billion of us now play games
[1592.89s -> 1594.97s]  in every region and on every continent.
[1596.79s -> 1598.87s]  And with new technological leaps,
[1599.67s -> 1602.31s]  we get to play whatever we want
[1602.39s -> 1605.11s]  with whomever we want and wherever we want.
[1606.41s -> 1608.33s]  Yeah, mom, you can't tell me when I can't.
[1608.33s -> 1609.61s]  I can't play my game now.
[1610.33s -> 1611.77s]  You can't tell me what to do, mom.
[1611.77s -> 1615.13s]  Every decision is guided by our belief
[1615.13s -> 1617.13s]  that gaming is for everyone.
[1617.93s -> 1621.13s]  My team and I are single-minded in our resolve
[1621.93s -> 1624.17s]  to bring everyone the games they want,
[1624.97s -> 1628.57s]  to connect everyone to play with the friends they want.
[1628.57s -> 1629.37s]  All right, I gotta get a copy.
[1629.37s -> 1632.89s]  And to empower everyone to play wherever they want.
[1632.89s -> 1634.17s]  Okay, I'm gonna get a copy.
[1635.05s -> 1638.42s]  So, just, I can't miss this.
[1638.42s -> 1639.22s]  Something big is gonna happen.
[1639.22s -> 1642.82s]  This is why we be innovating hardware and services.
[1642.82s -> 1645.78s]  It's why we're uniting communities through cross-play.
[1646.58s -> 1650.34s]  And it's why we're investing with new distinctive creators.
[1650.98s -> 1652.34s]  I'm gonna fucking sprint.
[1652.34s -> 1653.70s]  I'm gonna sprint as fast as I can.
[1654.82s -> 1658.58s]  This is why we scour the world for your next new games.
[1659.54s -> 1663.70s]  This today is the largest showcase of games
[1663.70s -> 1666.90s]  on any stage, anywhere this year.
[1668.02s -> 1675.85s]  Today, from the thousands of games in development
[1675.85s -> 1678.33s]  across Xbox One and Windows PC,
[1678.33s -> 1680.57s]  we're highlighting 60 games for you.
[1681.21s -> 1682.57s]  60 games?
[1682.57s -> 1686.41s]  Including 14 games from Xbox Game Studios.
[1686.41s -> 1687.21s]  That's too many.
[1688.09s -> 1689.85s]  How long is this broadcast?
[1690.49s -> 1692.09s]  An Xbox Game Pass.
[1692.09s -> 1693.05s]  It gets 60.
[1693.05s -> 1695.93s]  Yeah, we decided to not have anything to show you
[1695.93s -> 1697.29s]  for the last four years.
[1698.17s -> 1700.73s]  We thought 2019 was the time to do it.
[1701.88s -> 1704.20s]  What's next at Xbox Game Studios?
[1704.92s -> 1709.75s]  Expansive plans for streaming.
[1710.39s -> 1713.83s]  And of course, revealing more about our next new console.
[1714.71s -> 1720.22s]  So thank you for joining us today.
[1720.22s -> 1721.02s]  Let's jump in.
[1740.23s -> 1741.03s]  Ow, my knee.
[1742.47s -> 1743.91s]  Star Wars Episode VI?
[1744.79s -> 1750.28s]  I don't think this is weird.
[1796.18s -> 1796.66s]  Figuring it out.
[1817.50s -> 1818.00s]  Eh.
[1826.52s -> 1827.02s]  Eh.
[1831.30s -> 1832.50s]  I saw that yesterday.
[1834.50s -> 1837.21s]  I feel like this is going to be like every other game I've ever played.
[1838.89s -> 1840.73s]  I might as well just sit back and drink my beer.
[1841.61s -> 1854.78s]  New horror game.
[1854.78s -> 1857.99s]  Outlast 3.
[1859.66s -> 1860.94s]  Actually, is it Outlast 3?
[1881.02s -> 1882.30s]  I knew you guys were going to say Peter.
[1882.62s -> 1883.74s]  Wait up, bullet.
[1883.74s -> 1884.24s]  Bullet!
[1895.98s -> 1896.48s]  Dog.
[1919.88s -> 1920.60s]  Into the trees.
[1932.28s -> 1934.84s]  Dude, when you play the game, it's you watching the videotape.
[1936.39s -> 1937.35s]  Tapes in the trees.
[1937.35s -> 1938.15s]  That's what's going to be called.
[1939.37s -> 1939.93s]  Tree tapes.
[1941.11s -> 1941.75s]  Tree tops.
[1942.71s -> 1943.43s]  Tree tape tops.
[1948.31s -> 1949.35s]  The player of which...
[1950.39s -> 1951.11s]  I was close.
[1951.99s -> 1952.87s]  I was close.
[1954.55s -> 1955.83s]  Oh, here comes another one.
[2000.60s -> 2011.32s]  That's a neck warmer.
[2011.32s -> 2011.64s]  I love it.
[2011.64s -> 2012.12s]  I want it.
[2031.86s -> 2032.82s]  Neck toaster.
[2034.26s -> 2037.62s]  Dude, I can't wait for this 742-hour long campaign.
[2037.62s -> 2038.18s]  I can't wait.
[2074.94s -> 2076.94s]  Think about all the good **** that we're going to have, huh?
[2078.30s -> 2079.18s]  Oh, sorry.
[2101.88s -> 2102.38s]  Damn.
[2102.76s -> 2104.90s]  Oh, I got...
[2119.53s -> 2121.61s]  Take the ****, champ Dex.
[2121.61s -> 2122.49s]  He's got a jacks finger.
[2122.49s -> 2122.89s]  Did you see that?
[2122.89s -> 2126.89s]  Every corporal cop in this city is going to be blasting down these doors
[2126.89s -> 2130.01s]  after what you and your psycho friend did.
[2130.01s -> 2132.97s]  We didn't need all this **** tension, damn it.
[2134.41s -> 2135.69s]  Made for TV.
[2135.69s -> 2137.21s]  Edited for TV.
[2137.21s -> 2138.81s]  Cyberpunk 2077.
[2139.69s -> 2141.69s]  On USA Network.
[2142.49s -> 2178.30s]  Wake the **** up, samurai.
[2179.75s -> 2180.71s]  Wake the **** up.
[2180.71s -> 2181.51s]  We have a city to burn.
[2181.51s -> 2189.77s]  Hold on, is that John Wick?
[2193.80s -> 2195.32s]  Hey, Keanu Ree...
[2195.32s -> 2195.96s]  Keanu Ree...
[2195.96s -> 2197.48s]  Is this, like, John Wick 5?
[2198.44s -> 2203.02s]  Please welcome...
[2203.02s -> 2203.82s]  John Wick.
[2204.54s -> 2206.86s]  His name's not even Keanu anymore.
[2206.86s -> 2212.82s]  What is this, like...
[2212.82s -> 2214.02s]  What is this button on the screen?
[2214.02s -> 2215.14s]  Free order on Amazon.
[2215.70s -> 2216.34s]  What the ****?
[2229.93s -> 2233.93s]  See ya, thank you.
[2233.93s -> 2234.81s]  Legend.
[2234.81s -> 2237.05s]  It's like having Picasso on the stage.
[2237.05s -> 2238.73s]  I gotta talk to you about something.
[2245.43s -> 2246.95s]  CD Projekt...
[2246.95s -> 2251.21s]  Why is he acting like Christopher Walken?
[2251.21s -> 2253.61s]  Cyberpunk 2077.
[2253.61s -> 2254.41s]  I gotta tell you.
[2255.13s -> 2257.29s]  Cyberpunk 2077.
[2257.29s -> 2258.17s]  A while back...
[2258.17s -> 2259.29s]  He's being like Walken.
[2259.29s -> 2261.69s]  The guys from CD Projekt Red approached me
[2261.69s -> 2264.01s]  and asked me to be a part of their new project.
[2264.81s -> 2266.73s]  Cyberpunk 2077.
[2269.32s -> 2270.76s]  They were going on and on.
[2270.76s -> 2273.59s]  How they'd create this vast open world
[2273.59s -> 2275.83s]  with a branching storyline.
[2275.83s -> 2278.52s]  How you'd be able to customize your character
[2278.52s -> 2279.96s]  through in-game choices.
[2280.76s -> 2282.52s]  And it's not something I knew before,
[2282.52s -> 2283.88s]  but I was excited by it.
[2284.60s -> 2287.48s]  And I'm always drawn to fascinating stories.
[2288.68s -> 2290.12s]  I mean, this is cool.
[2290.76s -> 2291.88s]  Like, this is...
[2291.88s -> 2293.00s]  I gotta get on stage with John.
[2295.99s -> 2298.55s]  Is set in a metropolis of the future
[2299.27s -> 2302.31s]  where body modification has become an obsession.
[2303.11s -> 2304.63s]  Play as an outlaw.
[2304.63s -> 2306.23s]  An enhanced mercenary
[2306.23s -> 2309.03s]  working in the sleazy underbelly of the city.
[2310.55s -> 2311.05s]  Yeah.
[2311.59s -> 2312.09s]  Yeah.
[2314.82s -> 2315.62s]  Let me tell you.
[2317.37s -> 2320.09s]  The feeling of being there,
[2320.09s -> 2322.09s]  of walking the streets of the future
[2322.97s -> 2324.81s]  is really going to be breathtaking.
[2328.98s -> 2334.26s]  I'm trying.
[2334.26s -> 2335.22s]  All right, all right, all right.
[2335.22s -> 2337.30s]  So I gotta finish this.
[2337.30s -> 2337.94s]  So tell me.
[2340.10s -> 2341.30s]  Do you guys want to know
[2343.38s -> 2345.62s]  when there's the release date?
[2348.20s -> 2349.40s]  I think a lot of people do.
[2350.12s -> 2350.68s]  All right.
[2350.68s -> 2351.24s]  Be nice.
[2351.88s -> 2353.00s]  Then check this out.
[2353.72s -> 2360.44s]  You know, easy.
[2361.56s -> 2364.20s]  Mr. Hanson, am I right for the job, boy?
[2365.16s -> 2370.55s]  That's really cool, though.
[2370.55s -> 2372.63s]  If you have gone through to the other side,
[2373.83s -> 2374.55s]  let's do this.
[2374.55s -> 2379.69s]  This is going to be a pretty fun money management sim game.
[2390.14s -> 2392.22s]  They got you guys all fucking jacked up
[2392.22s -> 2393.50s]  of it being this crazy action game.
[2393.50s -> 2395.58s]  Now, it's going to be like a banking simulator.
[2395.58s -> 2396.78s]  World premiere.
[2397.82s -> 2399.61s]  That's a long way away,
[2399.61s -> 2400.65s]  but at least we have a day.
[2401.69s -> 2406.46s]  This fucking Keanu Reeves is just on the stage.
[2406.46s -> 2407.26s]  That's unbelievable.
[2407.82s -> 2410.55s]  Keanu Reeves is in this one, too.
[2426.95s -> 2427.45s]  Sell.
[2428.95s -> 2437.72s]  Hug.
[2437.72s -> 2440.12s]  Bail at Super Mario 2.
[2440.12s -> 2440.68s]  Radishes.
[2441.40s -> 2453.78s]  And how to say goodbye.
[2453.78s -> 2461.02s]  Look inside somebody's eye.
[2461.74s -> 2462.78s]  So you play like a germ.
[2463.50s -> 2465.90s]  And no, I'm not talking about you guys.
[2465.90s -> 2467.42s]  You know, I'm one of the germomites, one of the germs.
[2468.06s -> 2478.95s]  Once upon a shooting star.
[2478.95s -> 2480.23s]  I'm a spirit fairer.
[2480.79s -> 2482.33s]  Either one of them.
[2489.64s -> 2490.92s]  They really have like 100 games.
[2497.99s -> 2498.97s]  All right.
[2498.97s -> 2500.33s]  This better be fucking good
[2500.33s -> 2502.49s]  because I've been waiting a long time for this shit.
[2502.49s -> 2560.50s]  I'm not excited for it.
[2566.62s -> 2569.27s]  It looks good.
[2569.27s -> 2569.83s]  It looks all right.
[2569.83s -> 2571.43s]  It's just I don't like that kind of 2D.
[2572.95s -> 2574.15s]  Style for a game like that.
[2576.63s -> 2578.18s]  It's all right.
[2578.74s -> 2579.54s]  I'm not excited.
[2579.54s -> 2580.34s]  But it might be okay.
[2581.22s -> 2597.58s]  It looks pretty cool.
[2598.14s -> 2602.31s]  Look at how cool this looks.
[2603.11s -> 2610.86s]  This is the best game they've shown so far.
[2611.66s -> 2620.62s]  I can't remember what they showed.
[2626.66s -> 2627.46s]  I don't even know what that says.
[2629.27s -> 2629.51s]  Rip.
[2630.31s -> 2630.71s]  Pig.
[2630.71s -> 2632.23s]  I don't know what that said.
[2632.95s -> 2634.23s]  That's not a good marketing technique
[2634.23s -> 2635.67s]  because I don't know what the fucking name of the game is.
[2636.39s -> 2637.03s]  Egg time?
[2655.96s -> 2663.00s]  We're all right.
[2663.00s -> 2663.80s]  It is in full screen.
[2663.80s -> 2675.58s]  Oh, you're talking about them.
[2676.54s -> 2678.90s]  What was that one?
[2679.46s -> 2681.98s]  What was the one with the cameras?
[2696.63s -> 2707.00s]  Good luck with the one with the camera.
[2707.00s -> 2707.96s]  Supermarket Tree.
[2708.76s -> 2714.82s]  Springs Park game.
[2715.62s -> 2720.02s]  I mean these are all just going to get dumped on Xbox Live.
[2720.90s -> 2734.41s]  Wow, that was all one game.
[2734.41s -> 2735.21s]  Interesting.
[2735.21s -> 2737.90s]  What did I do with my camera?
[2738.86s -> 2743.11s]  Please welcome head of Xbox partnerships, Sarah Vaughn.
[2744.63s -> 2747.46s]  All right, here we go.
[2747.46s -> 2749.54s]  Let's get some like a big announcement here.
[2750.60s -> 2751.80s]  Very large announcement.
[2753.67s -> 2757.19s]  All the idea of Xbox games you just saw
[2757.19s -> 2760.71s]  will premiere on Xbox Game Pass day one.
[2760.71s -> 2761.35s]  Today?
[2761.35s -> 2764.39s]  Oh, there we go.
[2764.39s -> 2765.86s]  Where's the shot?
[2765.86s -> 2769.22s]  At Xbox, our passion is to help you find
[2769.22s -> 2770.82s]  and play the games that you love
[2771.46s -> 2774.50s]  through creation, curation, and discovery.
[2775.30s -> 2779.38s]  The ultimate expression of that passion is Xbox Game Pass.
[2780.42s -> 2785.06s]  My team travels the globe seeking out fan favorites
[2785.06s -> 2789.38s]  and hidden gems and craft partnerships with their creators
[2789.38s -> 2792.66s]  so that you can discover your next favorite game.
[2793.54s -> 2796.74s]  Mind-blowing experiences, epic adventures,
[2796.74s -> 2800.02s]  and iconic characters, all for you to explore.
[2800.02s -> 2800.66s]  It's all for me.
[2801.30s -> 2804.90s]  It has been awesome to see the record-breaking success
[2804.90s -> 2807.22s]  developers have had in Xbox Game Pass,
[2807.86s -> 2810.74s]  introducing their games to new players
[2810.74s -> 2812.90s]  and creating lifelong fans.
[2812.90s -> 2813.78s]  They got the computer set up.
[2813.78s -> 2816.66s]  Since launch, we have tripled the number of partners
[2816.66s -> 2820.26s]  in Game Pass, adding more games from more genres,
[2820.26s -> 2823.46s]  platformers, RPG, adventure, sports, puzzles,
[2823.46s -> 2825.30s]  and more every single month.
[2826.02s -> 2830.58s]  And of course, every Xbox Game Studio's title you see today
[2830.58s -> 2833.14s]  will premiere in Game Pass day one.
[2835.14s -> 2836.70s]  I mean, it's...
[2839.77s -> 2842.65s]  We are thrilled to announce new titles
[2842.65s -> 2845.29s]  coming to Xbox Game Pass on console today,
[2845.29s -> 2847.85s]  including Batman Arkham Knight,
[2850.22s -> 2858.54s]  Metro Exodus, and the Handsome Collection.
[2859.42s -> 2861.48s]  I mean, Microsoft has to do something.
[2861.48s -> 2863.40s]  They have to do something different
[2863.40s -> 2866.28s]  or something that Sony's not doing
[2866.28s -> 2868.52s]  because Sony's crushing them every single week.
[2869.90s -> 2871.66s]  Nintendo and Sony are crushing them.
[2871.66s -> 2872.70s]  Like they're being crushed.
[2872.70s -> 2875.34s]  It's for you to be able to play any game
[2875.34s -> 2877.82s]  with anyone, anywhere.
[2877.82s -> 2880.14s]  And we know for many of you that means PC.
[2881.66s -> 2882.46s]  That is why...
[2883.02s -> 2884.30s]  Okay, I'm listening.
[2884.30s -> 2888.70s]  Last month, we announced Xbox Game Pass for PC.
[2889.66s -> 2893.56s]  All right, I swear to God, I thought about it for a second.
[2893.56s -> 2895.08s]  I was going to dump the coffee on me.
[2895.08s -> 2899.00s]  Today, the Game Pass journey on PC begins.
[2899.00s -> 2900.04s]  That would be really dumb.
[2900.04s -> 2901.64s]  That would be a really stupid thing to do.
[2902.92s -> 2905.96s]  PC players can discover their next favorite game
[2905.96s -> 2907.24s]  with Xbox Game Pass.
[2907.80s -> 2912.36s]  We have curated over 100 games just for PC,
[2912.36s -> 2915.32s]  including favorites like Imperator Rome
[2915.32s -> 2917.08s]  and Football Manager 2019.
[2917.08s -> 2917.96s]  Did you already play these?
[2918.44s -> 2920.70s]  Like why do I need an Xbox Game Pass
[2920.70s -> 2922.78s]  if I already own like, everybody already owns these.
[2922.78s -> 2924.86s]  And for the first time on PC,
[2924.86s -> 2926.70s]  starting with Halo Reach,
[2926.70s -> 2929.66s]  the entire Master Chief collection.
[2929.66s -> 2931.58s]  Yeah, but we all knew that was coming.
[2932.86s -> 2938.70s]  It's Banjo-Kazooie 3 on PC only.
[2938.70s -> 2942.30s]  We are thrilled to share that Xbox Game Pass for PC
[2942.30s -> 2944.86s]  launches in open beta today.
[2945.82s -> 2946.62s]  Let's go get it.
[2946.62s -> 2949.02s]  Whenever you're ready.
[2949.10s -> 2949.90s]  Whenever you're ready.
[2952.49s -> 2952.99s]  Today.
[2958.23s -> 2961.61s]  Are you guys ready to play a bunch of games
[2961.61s -> 2963.13s]  that you've probably already played?
[2964.33s -> 2965.77s]  It's like a steam sale.
[2965.77s -> 2968.73s]  But like, those of you guys,
[2968.73s -> 2970.49s]  I can't speak, this is too loud in my ear.
[2974.63s -> 2976.07s]  If you haven't played these games,
[2976.07s -> 2978.55s]  you can spend like $2 to buy, you know,
[2979.19s -> 2980.87s]  the game that you like, Ark.
[2982.15s -> 2983.67s]  All right, if you haven't played Ark yet,
[2984.31s -> 2988.66s]  yeah, that was a game that you can get on steam sale
[2988.66s -> 2989.54s]  for like four dollars.
[2990.68s -> 2992.84s]  Wolfenstein 2, get that one for like six bucks
[2992.84s -> 2993.80s]  in like a month or two.
[2995.70s -> 2998.10s]  Pum Raider, yeah, these are all,
[2998.10s -> 3000.10s]  this is steam sale, this is Xbox steam sale.
[3005.93s -> 3008.49s]  But it's, but it is cool though, it is.
[3009.67s -> 3011.43s]  At least they're trying something different
[3012.07s -> 3013.75s]  because they're going to start to do this
[3014.39s -> 3015.35s]  and they're not,
[3015.35s -> 3017.43s]  the Xbox ain't going to fucking sell games anymore
[3017.43s -> 3018.23s]  like in five years.
[3018.23s -> 3019.11s]  Xbox Game Pass for PC is here.
[3019.11s -> 3020.87s]  It's going to be a subscription, like Netflix.
[3020.87s -> 3025.19s]  Now, try it out by downloading the all new Xbox app
[3025.19s -> 3025.91s]  on Windows.
[3027.24s -> 3029.48s]  And if you want it all,
[3030.28s -> 3033.48s]  we have created a membership just for you.
[3033.48s -> 3033.80s]  What is it?
[3033.80s -> 3036.44s]  Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
[3036.44s -> 3037.40s]  What does that mean?
[3037.40s -> 3038.20s]  What's the difference?
[3038.20s -> 3039.08s]  Why do you have two?
[3039.08s -> 3040.28s]  Wait, why are there two?
[3040.28s -> 3041.08s]  Why do you have two?
[3042.20s -> 3043.24s]  You get everything.
[3044.04s -> 3047.08s]  Xbox Game Pass for console with over 100 great games.
[3047.80s -> 3051.08s]  Xbox Live Gold, an unrivaled gaming community.
[3051.08s -> 3059.18s]  And now, Xbox Game Pass for PC at no additional charge.
[3059.18s -> 3064.06s]  All right, that's for, it's 15 bucks.
[3064.06s -> 3065.42s]  If it was like 20 or 30,
[3065.42s -> 3067.26s]  I might've been a little skeptical on that one.
[3067.26s -> 3070.46s]  Because it's E3, everyone can jump in
[3070.46s -> 3072.46s]  and play today for $1.
[3073.34s -> 3076.57s]  That's just to get you to sign up
[3076.57s -> 3077.93s]  and then you have to put your credit card in.
[3077.93s -> 3079.05s]  Your next favorite game.
[3079.05s -> 3079.93s]  They're doing the gym.
[3080.57s -> 3082.65s]  Xbox is going to win the next console war.
[3082.65s -> 3084.01s]  They're doing the gym fucking pass.
[3084.01s -> 3085.21s]  You know you're going to buy that for a dollar
[3085.21s -> 3085.85s]  and you're going to forget about it
[3085.85s -> 3086.73s]  and it's going to charge you every month.
[3086.73s -> 3088.28s]  You're going to forget you have it.
[3088.28s -> 3091.29s]  What a perfect, what an unbelievable strategy.
[3091.29s -> 3093.29s]  The you don't go to the gym strategy.
[3093.29s -> 3099.29s]  It's only five dollars to sign up
[3099.29s -> 3100.33s]  and then it's 20 a month.
[3101.13s -> 3119.85s]  Flight Simulator.
[3123.06s -> 3124.98s]  Somebody said Google Earth 4.
[3126.50s -> 3131.86s]  When was the last Flight Simulator
[3131.86s -> 3132.98s]  that they actually came out with?
[3136.06s -> 3137.34s]  This is a big deal to a lot of people.
[3147.27s -> 3149.43s]  Now Flight Simulator has a really,
[3149.43s -> 3151.99s]  really dedicated, huge community.
[3154.12s -> 3155.40s]  I'm telling you, there are people
[3155.40s -> 3156.52s]  that are freaking out right now
[3156.52s -> 3157.80s]  that are so happy to see them.
[3160.87s -> 3162.39s]  I'm glad, hopefully it's good.
[3180.71s -> 3185.08s]  Yeah, you might think that's boring
[3185.08s -> 3187.56s]  but that's a big deal to a ton of people.
[3194.97s -> 3199.46s]  Do you remember a time when armies were built
[3200.02s -> 3202.62s]  and powerful cities collapsed
[3204.34s -> 3206.18s]  when the smallest of choices
[3208.10s -> 3210.02s]  through the pages of history?
[3210.02s -> 3210.90s]  I wasn't going to lie.
[3210.90s -> 3214.58s]  It was an age of empires.
[3214.58s -> 3224.86s]  Yeah, here's the most played strategy games
[3224.86s -> 3225.74s]  ever in 4K.
[3226.78s -> 3229.29s]  This is the one where the guy
[3229.29s -> 3230.09s]  was on the plane, right?
[3230.81s -> 3233.08s]  Remember I told the story,
[3233.08s -> 3233.96s]  this is the one where I was watching
[3233.96s -> 3234.76s]  the guy playing on the plane.
[3234.76s -> 3236.36s]  This is Age of Kings, right?
[3236.36s -> 3248.10s]  Which was Age of King.
[3248.82s -> 3251.83s]  That wasn't Clash of Clans.
[3251.83s -> 3252.87s]  I was like fucking 14.
[3256.28s -> 3259.64s]  Razors, I see you at a donkey's age.
[3259.64s -> 3262.20s]  Welcome to beautiful Colorado.
[3262.20s -> 3264.92s]  Hold to the purple mountain's mastege
[3265.56s -> 3266.36s]  of the Rockies.
[3267.80s -> 3269.88s]  Hike through colorful canyons.
[3269.88s -> 3271.48s]  Get up close and personal
[3271.48s -> 3273.80s]  with a wild and wooly wildlife.
[3276.84s -> 3279.16s]  Sample our own cooked delicacies.
[3279.16s -> 3281.00s]  Eat where the locals eat.
[3282.68s -> 3284.68s]  Visit Colorado Springs.
[3285.80s -> 3290.60s]  There's so much to see and do
[3290.60s -> 3294.12s]  in this post-apocalyptic winter wonderland.
[3294.84s -> 3296.86s]  Do you like XCOM?
[3296.86s -> 3299.74s]  Be new people, make new friends.
[3300.46s -> 3302.78s]  Colorado has colorful characters
[3302.78s -> 3305.90s]  and friendly faces everywhere you look.
[3307.82s -> 3310.46s]  See our beautiful airport
[3311.18s -> 3313.18s]  and don't forget to pick yourself up
[3313.18s -> 3315.10s]  a nifty souvenir.
[3317.10s -> 3319.10s]  So don't be shy,
[3319.10s -> 3320.54s]  Colorado's waiting for you.
[3321.18s -> 3322.30s]  First round's on me.
[3323.26s -> 3324.54s]  First round's on you.
[3326.06s -> 3327.34s]  Oh, Wasteland, okay.
[3328.22s -> 3337.64s]  Please welcome, kind of Xbox Game Studios,
[3337.64s -> 3338.44s]  Matt Booty.
[3345.64s -> 3346.94s]  What do you got for us?
[3347.98s -> 3350.30s]  Games are at the heart of our mission.
[3350.94s -> 3351.34s]  Games!
[3351.34s -> 3354.62s]  All last year, we added seven new
[3354.62s -> 3356.94s]  game development studios to Xbox.
[3357.98s -> 3358.54s]  That's a lot.
[3359.10s -> 3361.34s]  It's fantastic to see some of these
[3361.34s -> 3364.06s]  studios already sharing new games
[3364.14s -> 3366.78s]  on our E3 stage and there's more to come.
[3367.58s -> 3369.26s]  I have the privilege of working with
[3369.26s -> 3372.14s]  some of the best studios around the globe
[3372.14s -> 3375.26s]  and for me, great studios are about
[3375.26s -> 3377.66s]  people, teams, and ideas.
[3378.30s -> 3381.02s]  Our success comes down to one thing,
[3381.66s -> 3384.30s]  creating great games that players love
[3384.86s -> 3389.34s]  and great games come from great developers.
[3389.34s -> 3391.98s]  That's why I'm honored today
[3391.98s -> 3395.98s]  to announce that joining Xbox Studios
[3395.98s -> 3399.10s]  is Double Fine Productions.
[3408.52s -> 3411.32s]  Double Fine has been a beacon of
[3411.32s -> 3413.32s]  creativity and spirit in game
[3413.32s -> 3415.96s]  development for almost 20 years
[3415.96s -> 3418.36s]  with classic games like Psychonauts,
[3418.36s -> 3421.00s]  Brutal Legend, and Broken Age.
[3421.00s -> 3423.32s]  I'm looking forward to Double Fine
[3423.32s -> 3427.32s]  joining Xbox and seeing what we create together.
[3427.32s -> 3429.00s]  Broken Age was kind of a disappointment.
[3429.00s -> 3430.68s]  Please join me in welcoming the founder
[3430.68s -> 3432.60s]  and president of Double Fine
[3432.60s -> 3434.60s]  Productions, Tim Schafer.
[3435.24s -> 3437.40s]  Psychonauts might be fun, Psychonauts 2,
[3437.40s -> 3439.56s]  but like Broken Age was that big
[3439.56s -> 3440.76s]  comeback kind of game there.
[3442.76s -> 3450.48s]  Thank you.
[3451.02s -> 3452.94s]  Thank you so much and thank you, Matt.
[3452.94s -> 3454.38s]  We are so excited to be joining
[3454.38s -> 3456.30s]  Xbox Game Studios and I'm here to
[3456.30s -> 3457.58s]  personally reassure you, Matt.
[3457.58s -> 3458.22s]  I don't know what you've heard,
[3458.22s -> 3459.34s]  but I'm a team player.
[3459.90s -> 3461.50s]  Whatever you need from Double Fine
[3461.50s -> 3463.26s]  will make the Halo stuff.
[3465.10s -> 3467.82s]  Forza stuff, Excel stuff,
[3467.82s -> 3469.34s]  whatever you want, we are there.
[3472.38s -> 3476.55s]  Tim, we just want you to make great games.
[3476.55s -> 3477.35s]  Oh, that's such a relief,
[3477.35s -> 3478.47s]  because I was totally lying.
[3478.47s -> 3480.07s]  Why don't they just get closer?
[3480.07s -> 3482.15s]  In that case, why are you talking
[3482.15s -> 3483.91s]  this far away from each other?
[3483.91s -> 3485.75s]  They're having like a general conversation
[3485.75s -> 3487.43s]  like fucking 60 feet away.
[3488.81s -> 3491.08s]  Just like stand in the middle together.
[3491.08s -> 3492.60s]  That was so weird because it was like,
[3492.60s -> 3493.96s]  oh hey, so what do you think about this?
[3493.96s -> 3495.96s]  Guy fucking a football field away?
[3495.96s -> 3496.76s]  All right, I gotta shut up.
[3500.10s -> 3505.06s]  My name is Raz and today is my first
[3505.06s -> 3506.58s]  official day on the job.
[3507.38s -> 3510.06s]  We're on a mission.
[3510.62s -> 3511.58s]  Rasputin?
[3511.58s -> 3512.54s]  I'm on him.
[3512.54s -> 3513.34s]  Looking for me?
[3515.18s -> 3532.31s]  The mission is falling apart.
[3532.31s -> 3533.99s]  We've lost control of Roboto.
[3533.99s -> 3535.59s]  I put the whole leg in the box
[3535.59s -> 3537.83s]  and the basket in the basket.
[3537.83s -> 3540.23s]  No, no, I won't tell.
[3540.23s -> 3541.59s]  I won't tell anyone.
[3541.59s -> 3542.63s]  I promise.
[3542.63s -> 3546.55s]  Yes, no, please, no.
[3546.55s -> 3560.12s]  Psycho Nox 2, back into the domain.
[3560.12s -> 3561.40s]  No tagline, okay.
[3561.40s -> 3562.76s]  No, no, um.
[3562.76s -> 3564.28s]  World premiere.
[3564.28s -> 3564.84s]  No colon?
[3583.56s -> 3585.80s]  Every fucking star, I mean, this is like,
[3587.32s -> 3589.18s]  when you hear the music
[3589.98s -> 3591.58s]  and you hear the lightsaber sounds,
[3591.58s -> 3593.98s]  I feel like I hear this in my fucking sleep.
[3593.98s -> 3595.90s]  I gotta tell you about a dream I had.
[3595.90s -> 3596.54s]  It's crazy.
[3597.18s -> 3598.86s]  Nothing to do with Star Wars or E3.
[3598.86s -> 3600.62s]  I'll wait till the presentation's over to tell you.
[3609.99s -> 3610.79s]  What do you mean, shut up?
[3611.51s -> 3611.99s]  Shut up?
[3612.95s -> 3616.49s]  It's LEGO Star Wars.
[3616.49s -> 3617.37s]  Is it that big of a deal?
[3618.01s -> 3619.19s]  Should I be quiet?
[3623.86s -> 3624.34s]  Yes.
[3659.74s -> 3663.02s]  Is this Dragon Ball Z Full Fighter
[3663.02s -> 3664.62s]  First Extreme Four?
[3671.08s -> 3703.32s]  All right, if it's over 10 syllables, I win.
[3703.32s -> 3705.08s]  Dragon Ball Game Pro, hold on.
[3705.64s -> 3707.64s]  Dragon Ball Game Project Z.
[3707.64s -> 3708.28s]  What's underneath it?
[3713.21s -> 3714.25s]  There was something underneath it too.
[3716.82s -> 3717.94s]  World premiere.
[3718.58s -> 3737.85s]  I have a surprise for you.
[3737.85s -> 3738.35s]  Okay.
[3743.46s -> 3744.50s]  You want to guess what it is?
[3746.10s -> 3747.85s]  This is an outfit for a newborn.
[3748.57s -> 3750.01s]  You bought it this morning.
[3750.01s -> 3751.21s]  You wanted to surprise me.
[3751.77s -> 3752.25s]  I'm sorry.
[3752.25s -> 3752.73s]  You're pregnant.
[3754.34s -> 3754.90s]  You know?
[3755.62s -> 3758.94s]  I know because you already gave it to me.
[3759.98s -> 3761.02s]  This has happened before.
[3762.44s -> 3763.64s]  What are you talking about?
[3764.28s -> 3765.24s]  What's going on?
[3765.24s -> 3766.44s]  Someone is coming.
[3766.44s -> 3767.56s]  He's going to hurt us.
[3767.56s -> 3768.92s]  He says you killed your father.
[3770.20s -> 3771.32s]  I need to know what happened.
[3773.91s -> 3774.87s]  Why are you doing this?
[3776.09s -> 3776.81s]  My father died.
[3776.81s -> 3777.77s]  Tired of a heart attack?
[3779.03s -> 3782.15s]  No, I didn't have anything to do
[3782.15s -> 3783.35s]  with it.
[3783.35s -> 3785.27s]  Any second now, he's going to knock on that door.
[3785.99s -> 3786.55s]  Help me.
[3786.55s -> 3788.07s]  This isn't happening.
[3788.07s -> 3789.27s]  This can't be happening.
[3790.15s -> 3791.51s]  Police, open up.
[3792.07s -> 3792.55s]  That's him.
[3793.19s -> 3794.55s]  Did you call the police?
[3795.35s -> 3796.63s]  We have a warrant.
[3796.63s -> 3798.15s]  Please open the door.
[3798.15s -> 3799.51s]  I didn't do anything.
[3799.51s -> 3800.79s]  We're here to help.
[3800.79s -> 3801.51s]  Don't listen to him.
[3802.47s -> 3803.59s]  I'm your only chance.
[3804.31s -> 3806.07s]  Open the door right now.
[3806.07s -> 3806.63s]  What?
[3806.63s -> 3807.75s]  You know what I mean.
[3807.75s -> 3808.39s]  I love you.
[3809.11s -> 3810.39s]  You have to believe me.
[3810.39s -> 3811.43s]  Stop.
[3811.51s -> 3811.99s]  No.
[3811.99s -> 3812.95s]  You're under arrest.
[3812.95s -> 3813.59s]  Hey!
[3813.59s -> 3814.39s]  Is it 47?
[3820.66s -> 3821.22s]  You're home.
[3822.26s -> 3822.90s]  What are you doing?
[3823.46s -> 3824.02s]  Are you okay?
[3826.94s -> 3835.18s]  This is what it's like to be a hitman NPC.
[3836.86s -> 3839.05s]  Holy shit, they're really going meta with this.
[3843.82s -> 3845.66s]  He keeps reloading the same level.
[3845.66s -> 3847.10s]  And he keeps coming and killing us.
[3847.90s -> 3849.34s]  You gotta help me.
[3850.14s -> 3859.77s]  He thinks it's really funny to like throw shit at our heads.
[3859.77s -> 3861.45s]  Like rocks and shovels.
[3861.53s -> 3882.01s]  The lights will guide you.
[3882.01s -> 3882.81s]  Bambi.
[3882.81s -> 3894.68s]  Look at this.
[3896.58s -> 3899.06s]  What's in here?
[3899.78s -> 3900.66s]  Let's go.
[3900.66s -> 3907.66s]  Be careful, let's jump.
[3908.54s -> 3915.26s]  I want a treat.
[3915.90s -> 3916.70s]  Here, you can have a treat.
[3916.70s -> 3917.26s]  Here, take that.
[3918.06s -> 3934.97s]  They're losing him.
[3938.38s -> 3939.18s]  I'm already gone.
[3944.18s -> 3944.82s]  I don't know who that is.
[3944.82s -> 3946.10s]  I don't know who to cheer for.
[3947.06s -> 3948.17s]  I don't know what this is.
[3954.52s -> 3965.40s]  Is this Gears of War?
[3977.53s -> 3979.69s]  Are these the people she's like consumed?
[3981.45s -> 3983.45s]  Are these all the souls that she's consumed or something?
[3983.45s -> 3984.09s]  I don't know what this is.
[4015.48s -> 4018.70s]  I might have an unpopular opinion about Gears.
[4020.06s -> 4023.42s]  But Gears, to me, is one of those like TV shows
[4023.98s -> 4026.94s]  that had like the first or second amazing season.
[4026.94s -> 4028.78s]  And then they were like, we're just going to keep this going.
[4028.86s -> 4030.78s]  Studio head Rod Ferguson.
[4031.50s -> 4034.22s]  It's like you came out with, you came out with like Westworld.
[4035.34s -> 4036.78s]  And then, holy shit, this was awesome.
[4036.78s -> 4039.50s]  And then you like decided that Westworld 2 and 3 were going to come out.
[4039.50s -> 4040.78s]  And it's like, whoa, what are you doing?
[4042.30s -> 4043.42s]  Thanks, everyone.
[4043.42s -> 4047.74s]  We're excited to announce that Gears 5 is releasing on September 10th.
[4048.86s -> 4051.51s]  I didn't even know there was a Gears 4.
[4051.51s -> 4052.55s]  I swear to God, I didn't know that.
[4052.55s -> 4055.35s]  And if you want to play four days early, you can.
[4055.35s -> 4057.43s]  With our Ultimate Edition or membership
[4057.43s -> 4059.91s]  in the newly announced Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
[4061.19s -> 4062.90s]  It's fun, right?
[4062.90s -> 4064.42s]  It's like third person multiplayer.
[4064.42s -> 4066.18s]  Like out of Gears 3, it was fun, right?
[4091.86s -> 4093.62s]  But they really are just seasons now.
[4093.62s -> 4096.82s]  In September, we return to the biggest Gears campaign ever,
[4096.82s -> 4099.22s]  where we'll explore more of Kate's harrowing journey
[4099.22s -> 4101.30s]  and celebrate our launch on September 10th.
[4102.42s -> 4103.78s]  But what are we talking about today?
[4104.66s -> 4107.38s]  Today, it's a brand new way to fight the swarm.
[4108.42s -> 4111.14s]  In Escape, you play as one of three Hive Busters.
[4111.14s -> 4111.78s]  Why do I need to be here?
[4111.78s -> 4113.46s]  You and your squad infiltrate the hive,
[4114.10s -> 4116.90s]  plant the bomb, and escape with your life.
[4116.90s -> 4120.10s]  Because we all know that best defense is a good offense.
[4120.18s -> 4121.78s]  It's everything you love about Gears.
[4122.42s -> 4124.34s]  Turned up to 11.
[4124.34s -> 4126.50s]  No, actually, the best offense is a good defense with thorns.
[4127.62s -> 4128.58s]  Get your RPG right.
[4131.21s -> 4132.49s]  Oh, Jesus Christ!
[4133.21s -> 4134.33s]  You did it too early!
[4138.26s -> 4139.38s]  Holy shit.
[4139.38s -> 4141.46s]  He was probably shitting his pants up there.
[4141.46s -> 4144.34s]  Like, please don't press the fucking button early.
[4144.34s -> 4146.26s]  Please don't press the button early.
[4147.22s -> 4163.05s]  Dude, somebody in the front row got like their eyebrows singed off.
[4163.69s -> 4164.76s]  That's like a...
[4164.76s -> 4165.16s]  What the...
[4166.12s -> 4166.62s]  Ah!
[4169.67s -> 4170.55s]  Wait, are we under the stage?
[4171.35s -> 4174.46s]  They attacked.
[4174.46s -> 4176.10s]  We lost everything.
[4176.10s -> 4180.57s]  Everything except the need for revenge.
[4182.49s -> 4185.93s]  This might look like a surrender, but it's not.
[4187.86s -> 4189.06s]  It's an invasion.
[4201.67s -> 4202.71s]  Gears 6.
[4202.71s -> 4204.71s]  That's right, we're doing both back to back.
[4205.90s -> 4206.70s]  Two months apart.
[4216.82s -> 4217.62s]  Escape 4.
[4217.70s -> 4251.38s]  Ozzy Osborne and then Gorillaz.
[4281.03s -> 4282.07s]  I don't know what else feels like we're...
[4284.12s -> 4285.88s]  It's hard to differentiate video games, huh?
[4302.34s -> 4304.26s]  Am I getting old or is it just like...
[4304.26s -> 4306.90s]  Are we just seeing like the same five video games made?
[4307.46s -> 4308.74s]  Like in the last three or four years?
[4310.34s -> 4314.94s]  I mean, I'm just getting old.
[4318.63s -> 4329.14s]  Escape.
[4329.14s -> 4330.42s]  Oh, it is Gears.
[4332.90s -> 4334.58s]  It just is Gears 5.
[4335.30s -> 4336.82s]  Okay, all right.
[4336.82s -> 4337.06s]  Okay.
[4337.06s -> 4341.38s]  An aggressive three-player co-op experience perfect for your living room couch.
[4341.38s -> 4341.86s]  Wait a second.
[4341.86s -> 4342.34s]  Oh, fuck.
[4342.34s -> 4343.06s]  It's not just about...
[4343.06s -> 4344.58s]  They're gonna press the fire button again.
[4344.58s -> 4345.46s]  Are we gonna get out of here?
[4345.46s -> 4347.78s]  And challenge your friends with the experiences you create.
[4348.50s -> 4352.90s]  And tonight, join me on Mixer as we challenge these three WWE superstars,
[4352.90s -> 4359.70s]  Xavier Woods, AJ Styles, and Tyler Breeze to find a gameplay deep dive from
[4359.70s -> 4360.74s]  right here in the hive.
[4361.38s -> 4363.70s]  For these at home, for the next two days,
[4363.70s -> 4367.06s]  you and your friends can play in select Microsoft stores.
[4367.06s -> 4370.42s]  So good luck out running the swarm and we'll see you on the leaderboards.
[4370.42s -> 4373.70s]  Oh, and for anyone who pre-orders or plays within the first week,
[4373.70s -> 4376.18s]  I got something special just for you.
[4376.18s -> 4376.58s]  What is it?
[4378.82s -> 4379.62s]  Oh, not the ice.
[4380.58s -> 4381.70s]  It's getting cold in here.
[4382.98s -> 4383.86s]  They all freeze up.
[4387.00s -> 4390.84s]  Special fucking pre-order armor set with extra fucking buttons on it.
[4410.22s -> 4411.90s]  It's the Terminator.
[4413.18s -> 4423.30s]  Oh, my God.
[4423.30s -> 4424.74s]  Games are so weird now.
[4425.38s -> 4432.14s]  What is this?
[4432.86s -> 4434.46s]  It's a new mouse.
[4435.10s -> 4437.35s]  New controller.
[4437.35s -> 4438.55s]  The Xbox T Leap Mouse.
[4440.23s -> 4442.36s]  Not about a controller.
[4442.36s -> 4442.68s]  It is.
[4442.68s -> 4443.56s]  It's a controller.
[4443.56s -> 4445.00s]  World's most advanced controller.
[4446.12s -> 4447.00s]  That's too many buttons.
[4447.00s -> 4447.64s]  That's too much.
[4447.64s -> 4448.12s]  I don't want to...
[4448.12s -> 4449.24s]  That's like freaking me out.
[4449.96s -> 4456.92s]  The thumb stick comes off and then turns the car and then engine in there.
[4457.48s -> 4459.26s]  All right.
[4459.26s -> 4460.14s]  That's actually really cool.
[4460.78s -> 4468.94s]  You change the thumb stick.
[4468.94s -> 4469.74s]  That's everything you like.
[4473.21s -> 4473.93s]  That's really cool.
[4473.93s -> 4474.57s]  This is awesome.
[4474.57s -> 4476.09s]  Is this like 500 bucks?
[4476.65s -> 4479.21s]  Can you get an Xbox Elite controller or a Vive?
[4479.21s -> 4479.93s]  Let's find out.
[4481.45s -> 4485.22s]  All right.
[4485.22s -> 4486.18s]  All really cool things.
[4486.18s -> 4487.14s]  All really awesome features.
[4487.14s -> 4487.70s]  Looks great.
[4489.19s -> 4493.83s]  Can I experience virtual reality or own a new controller?
[4494.71s -> 4513.19s]  Pre-order now at Xbox.
[4513.19s -> 4514.31s]  Let's find out how much it is.
[4514.31s -> 4515.69s]  How much is it?
[4521.54s -> 4522.66s]  You watch this, I'll forget something.
[4523.22s -> 4529.98s]  My father saved my life.
[4529.98s -> 4531.74s]  He told me never to forget who I am.
[4532.30s -> 4533.18s]  Where I come from.
[4533.82s -> 4539.58s]  In this place, nobody even wants to know my name.
[4539.58s -> 4541.42s]  Getting attached is deadly.
[4543.42s -> 4544.46s]  By the way, maybe we talked about...
[4544.46s -> 4546.14s]  Every game is like the same five games.
[4546.14s -> 4548.54s]  Every game also uses the same five voice actors.
[4549.10s -> 4549.98s]  I might be gone.
[4549.98s -> 4556.89s]  We'll get into like...
[4557.69s -> 4559.93s]  Just like shake us all up in a jar.
[4560.97s -> 4568.79s]  But I won't let it turn me into an animal.
[4568.79s -> 4571.59s]  Staying alive became the essence of our existence.
[4571.59s -> 4573.91s]  Yet life must be more than just survival.
[4574.87s -> 4577.93s]  It's $150, by the way, for that console.
[4578.97s -> 4581.61s]  Every day the disease tries to crush us
[4581.61s -> 4583.61s]  and make us forget who we are.
[4583.61s -> 4585.45s]  But I keep fighting.
[4586.09s -> 4591.91s]  Name is Aiden.
[4591.91s -> 4593.78s]  I'm infected.
[4594.74s -> 4601.43s]  Dying Light was fun.
[4604.62s -> 4607.82s]  Maybe it'll be fun again a second time.
[4610.15s -> 4611.35s]  World premiere.
[4612.23s -> 4615.90s]  I'll be on camera for like at least 10 seconds on this one.
[4615.90s -> 4617.98s]  Just in case I need to do like a fucking fake reaction.
[4618.94s -> 4629.19s]  He steps on the gas.
[4629.19s -> 4630.55s]  Starts peeling out of the stage.
[4632.87s -> 4635.61s]  No, that's the big thing.
[4635.61s -> 4637.37s]  They put a jump on the stage and he hits the gas.
[4637.37s -> 4638.25s]  And it goes zero to 60.
[4638.25s -> 4639.45s]  Goes over the fucking jump.
[4639.45s -> 4641.61s]  Over the audience like Evel Knievel style.
[4641.61s -> 4642.49s]  Like lands over them.
[4642.49s -> 4643.77s]  Everyone's like, holy fuck!
[4654.90s -> 4656.50s]  It's LEGO!
[4657.54s -> 4661.06s]  Why do they have to do this to every single franchise?
[4662.42s -> 4662.90s]  LEGO!
[4663.62s -> 4664.66s]  I just gave myself a headache.
[4666.90s -> 4669.22s]  Why does everyone have to have LEGO counterparts?
[4670.26s -> 4670.76s]  LEGO!
[4671.94s -> 4677.82s]  I gotta shut up.
[4677.82s -> 4678.54s]  I gotta be quiet.
[4707.35s -> 4709.27s]  I think they just figured out how to make double the money.
[4710.54s -> 4713.10s]  Just make a video game and make a LEGO counterpart.
[4713.90s -> 4716.06s]  Please welcome Ralph Bolton.
[4716.06s -> 4720.30s]  Just reskin it as a LEGO game and it'll sell twice as much every time.
[4721.66s -> 4732.06s]  Aaron's passion for design with about half a million of LEGO's legendary bricks.
[4732.06s -> 4733.02s]  Make Gears LEGO.
[4733.02s -> 4737.26s]  Incredible life-size LEGO Speed Champions McLaren Senna.
[4738.46s -> 4741.02s]  Now watch me destroy it with this baseball bat.
[4743.02s -> 4745.50s]  Took him 200 hours to make this fucking thing.
[4746.46s -> 4748.46s]  LEGO Speed Champions expansion.
[4749.18s -> 4753.02s]  You will drive this Senna and more LEGO Speed Champions cars
[4753.02s -> 4757.18s]  in an entirely new world packed with inventive new challenges.
[4757.18s -> 4761.50s]  New areas to explore and loads of bricks to smash.
[4761.50s -> 4766.62s]  The Forza Horizon for LEGO Speed Champions expansion launches this week.
[4767.26s -> 4767.98s]  I'll see you there.
[4768.94s -> 4769.90s]  Oh it's an expansion.
[4769.90s -> 4773.82s]  I wanna like gotcha expansions in this conference.
[4775.58s -> 4777.50s]  Oh yeah they're already doing it.
[4777.50s -> 4778.54s]  They're doing it already.
[4778.54s -> 4779.82s]  They're doing it already.
[4779.82s -> 4780.62s]  I they already did it.
[4780.62s -> 4782.54s]  I remember this fucking three years ago.
[4782.54s -> 4783.42s]  They're already doing this.
[4784.30s -> 4785.82s]  That's the best you're gonna do.
[4787.13s -> 4788.57s]  They actually are doing it.
[4789.37s -> 4797.02s]  You have to appeal to every single potential customer now.
[4798.68s -> 4801.40s]  Now what's the age range for your for your free game or your franchise?
[4804.12s -> 4806.60s]  I want everyone to be able to play that game.
[4806.60s -> 4808.20s]  I want everyone to buy it.
[4808.20s -> 4811.80s]  We're talking diapers to retirement.
[4813.48s -> 4814.76s]  One to 80.
[4815.64s -> 4845.83s]  We're not gonna just play chess.
[4862.28s -> 4863.16s]  LEGO chess.
[4863.96s -> 4866.52s]  My mission find the father I never knew.
[4867.48s -> 4869.96s]  My mission find a hero I've never met.
[4871.08s -> 4872.60s]  He hasn't radioed in days.
[4873.64s -> 4875.64s]  He hasn't been seen since the outbreak.
[4876.52s -> 4877.96s]  The last time I heard his voice.
[4878.60s -> 4883.46s]  The last place he was seen was in Trouble Valley.
[4884.50s -> 4885.54s]  Trouble Valley.
[4886.98s -> 4888.10s]  Trouble Valley.
[4888.10s -> 4889.30s]  I've only heard whispers.
[4889.94s -> 4891.06s]  Trouble Valley.
[4891.06s -> 4892.10s]  I've only heard legends.
[4892.74s -> 4894.34s]  Of unseen horrors.
[4894.98s -> 4898.50s]  Here we are the many.
[4899.22s -> 4901.14s]  Here we can become stronger.
[4902.26s -> 4905.18s]  For so long I was just surviving.
[4906.14s -> 4907.58s]  Now people are counting on me.
[4907.58s -> 4908.78s]  This was written by a computer.
[4909.74s -> 4911.74s]  This is where my story could end.
[4912.94s -> 4916.44s]  This is where my story could begin.
[4917.72s -> 4919.72s]  I thought we had seen everything.
[4921.72s -> 4924.73s]  We ain't seen nothing yet.
[4925.85s -> 4937.06s]  It's another fucking gotcha.
[4937.06s -> 4938.02s]  What is this?
[4938.10s -> 4938.66s]  What is this?
[4941.35s -> 4943.27s]  It's a dated to K2 Heartland.
[4943.91s -> 4945.59s]  It's another like gotcha expansion.
[4948.76s -> 4953.08s]  Every game has become so diluted together that like I think these are new games
[4953.08s -> 4955.64s]  but they've already existed and they're just expansions.
[4955.64s -> 4956.44s]  I'm stupid.
[4957.74s -> 4958.62s]  Oh my god.
[4958.62s -> 4960.78s]  Are we gonna get lego sonic?
[4961.50s -> 4962.70s]  Lego sonic incoming.
[4967.86s -> 4969.62s]  What is this?
[4969.62s -> 4969.94s]  Hold on.
[4969.94s -> 4970.66s]  Wait a minute.
[4970.66s -> 4971.46s]  Is this actually it?
[4972.02s -> 4976.94s]  Is this fantasy star?
[4976.94s -> 4978.30s]  If it's fantasy star I'm gonna get it.
[4978.86s -> 5014.33s]  I don't think it is.
[5015.74s -> 5016.38s]  Oh is it?
[5017.42s -> 5018.14s]  I can't tell.
[5018.78s -> 5020.06s]  I can't tell.
[5021.42s -> 5026.54s]  You're in a Gears of War game or like an anime sword fighter game.
[5027.34s -> 5028.46s]  I can't tell anymore.
[5029.34s -> 5044.46s]  No, no.
[5044.46s -> 5044.86s]  Is it?
[5044.86s -> 5045.10s]  Is it?
[5045.10s -> 5045.58s]  I don't think it is.
[5053.70s -> 5054.02s]  It is.
[5055.27s -> 5056.07s]  It actually is.
[5056.87s -> 5060.58s]  I gave you a reaction.
[5060.58s -> 5063.46s]  Those of you who have played fantasy star know
[5063.46s -> 5066.82s]  that this game had influenced many of the most popular games today.
[5066.82s -> 5068.02s]  This game was sick.
[5068.02s -> 5072.42s]  So with great delight we welcome SEGA back to our stage
[5072.42s -> 5075.22s]  and fantasy star back on Xbox.
[5078.68s -> 5079.88s]  That's actually pretty cool.
[5079.88s -> 5080.68s]  This is a classic.
[5080.68s -> 5085.72s]  As we said our goal on team Xbox is to bring you the world's best games.
[5086.52s -> 5087.96s]  Meeting with developers,
[5087.96s -> 5092.44s]  playing their games and introducing you to their games.
[5092.44s -> 5094.12s]  These are the best parts of my job.
[5095.24s -> 5099.00s]  Back at E3 2017 when I first met with the creators
[5099.00s -> 5101.96s]  of this next game they shared their ambition.
[5103.08s -> 5107.32s]  To bring their massively popular game with its passionate community
[5107.32s -> 5112.12s]  of 650 million PC players to the entire world.
[5112.12s -> 5112.92s]  What is that?
[5112.92s -> 5113.16s]  Dota?
[5113.16s -> 5118.36s]  I'm happy to announce our partnership with the legendary team at Smilegate.
[5119.24s -> 5123.72s]  Their approach to game design demonstrates sheer creative boldness.
[5124.76s -> 5128.20s]  Next year you'll discover the newest entry
[5128.20s -> 5130.04s]  in this landmark franchise.
[5130.92s -> 5135.88s]  On console for the very first time only on Xbox.
[5136.44s -> 5138.52s]  This is Crossfire X.
[5142.95s -> 5144.79s]  What the fuck is Crossfire X?
[5145.59s -> 5149.00s]  Am I supposed to know what this is?
[5151.24s -> 5152.84s]  Crossfire X?
[5152.84s -> 5154.44s]  Did he make up those numbers?
[5154.44s -> 5155.64s]  Did he make that up?
[5155.64s -> 5156.28s]  Was that a joke?
[5157.18s -> 5158.62s]  What is Crossfire X?
[5159.26s -> 5181.96s]  First to console.
[5182.97s -> 5184.81s]  I'm gonna get care more about Fantasy Star 2.
[5184.81s -> 5186.33s]  That's a fucking pretty big deal.
[5186.33s -> 5194.34s]  It's a mobile game?
[5194.34s -> 5201.74s]  Oh, wait, a mobile game is the most played FPS in the world?
[5201.74s -> 5202.38s]  Is that what he said?
[5203.18s -> 5219.43s]  Crossfire X.
[5220.47s -> 5237.93s]  So this game already exists and it's existed for a long time.
[5237.93s -> 5239.05s]  So where's the gameplay?
[5239.05s -> 5247.96s]  Now it's in 2007.
[5248.76s -> 5255.00s]  Crossfire X.
[5256.12s -> 5261.64s]  Well, I mean, they got the red X on the right spot
[5261.64s -> 5262.92s]  because I ain't gonna be buying that one.
[5270.10s -> 5271.22s]  World Premiere.
[5271.86s -> 5289.96s]  Something we knew as truth.
[5291.40s -> 5314.15s]  Wait, that person's mask on their face.
[5314.15s -> 5314.95s]  I don't know if you see it.
[5314.95s -> 5315.83s]  All right, I'm gonna quiet.
[5338.12s -> 5338.76s]  Rise up.
[5339.80s -> 5349.74s]  What is it?
[5351.64s -> 5353.64s]  Tales of Arise Up.
[5354.76s -> 5363.51s]  2020.
[5380.46s -> 5382.54s]  There are six sirens in the universe.
[5383.18s -> 5384.38s]  I used to be one of them.
[5385.42s -> 5386.38s]  My name is Lilith.
[5390.71s -> 5392.39s]  Not actual gameplay.
[5393.35s -> 5395.46s]  You can't do this in the game.
[5395.46s -> 5398.26s]  It just looks cool on camera.
[5399.30s -> 5420.65s]  Not actual gameplay.
[5420.65s -> 5421.37s]  It's like, all right.
[5422.17s -> 5425.11s]  Is this not, is that not gameplay?
[5443.29s -> 5444.57s]  Interlacing on this screen.
[5445.61s -> 5446.81s]  Like a bad feed or something.
[5446.81s -> 5448.65s]  Children of the vault is a psycho cult.
[5449.29s -> 5452.65s]  10 billion followers demand we join or die.
[5453.29s -> 5457.88s]  We've got another proposal for them.
[5460.23s -> 5461.59s]  Censor out a murder figure.
[5462.07s -> 5465.00s]  I'm sorry.
[5465.00s -> 5467.40s]  That's like Chuck E. Cheese level of sensor and something.
[5469.78s -> 5472.98s]  In fact, I swear to God, an employee at Chuck E. Cheese
[5472.98s -> 5474.98s]  gave me the finger one time when I was like eight.
[5474.98s -> 5477.30s]  I was trying to shake the machine to like three points
[5477.30s -> 5479.30s]  and he like came over and fixed it and gave me the finger.
[5480.34s -> 5496.49s]  Can't show the middle finger
[5496.49s -> 5498.73s]  but you can show people like exploding.
[5500.73s -> 5501.53s]  Yeah, it's like.
[5502.57s -> 5504.62s]  Hey, I have an idea.
[5504.62s -> 5508.46s]  Let's have a person's head like fucking explode on camera
[5508.46s -> 5510.38s]  but like no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5511.50s -> 5515.19s]  Let's have a guy's like eyes get two spikes
[5515.19s -> 5518.31s]  like through his head and his brain comes out the back.
[5519.50s -> 5520.86s]  But don't say that word.
[5520.86s -> 5521.50s]  How dare you?
[5523.69s -> 5524.89s]  World premiere.
[5544.33s -> 5550.92s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[5550.92s -> 5582.01s]  Even imagine its fullest brilliance.
[5583.05s -> 5593.99s]  The Elden were shattered.
[5603.46s -> 5603.94s]  Tell me.
[5640.55s -> 5641.43s]  Elden Ring.
[5641.43s -> 5642.87s]  Xbox One NPC.
[5642.87s -> 5644.87s]  Wait, is this an Xbox exclusive?
[5644.87s -> 5653.80s]  You got George R. R. Martin and oh, man.
[5653.80s -> 5659.45s]  Oh, my God.
[5659.45s -> 5659.95s]  What the?
[5664.10s -> 5665.24s]  Please welcome.
[5665.24s -> 5666.60s]  Can you get somebody to talk about that?
[5668.20s -> 5671.08s]  That's a way to sell like a fucking 500 million.
[5671.08s -> 5675.16s]  From multi-national studios to one-person passion projects,
[5675.80s -> 5678.92s]  thousands of Xbox games are in development for you
[5678.92s -> 5679.72s]  right now.
[5679.72s -> 5680.44s]  Thousands.
[5680.44s -> 5683.40s]  Just today, we showed you 60 games.
[5684.36s -> 5688.44s]  We are now experiencing an unmatched expansion
[5688.44s -> 5690.28s]  of creativity on Xbox.
[5691.32s -> 5695.24s]  Gaming for you means connecting all of these creators
[5695.24s -> 5696.04s]  to all of you.
[5697.16s -> 5700.28s]  Last fall, we announced our ambition
[5700.28s -> 5703.32s]  to empower everyone everywhere to play
[5704.12s -> 5706.52s]  by bringing Xbox to the cloud.
[5707.48s -> 5709.64s]  We will do this in two ways.
[5710.36s -> 5715.16s]  Through Project X Cloud and through console streaming.
[5716.28s -> 5720.28s]  Two months ago, we connected all Xbox developers
[5720.28s -> 5721.64s]  to Project X Cloud.
[5722.44s -> 5726.68s]  Today, unfortunately, it's been hacked.
[5726.68s -> 5731.40s]  And 50,000 people that got connected to the cloud
[5731.40s -> 5733.00s]  lost all their information.
[5733.00s -> 5736.28s]  To experience the freedom to play right here at the show.
[5737.48s -> 5739.16s]  And you'll have two ways to stream.
[5740.12s -> 5742.09s]  There's a new platform feature.
[5742.81s -> 5743.93s]  Console streaming.
[5744.65s -> 5749.21s]  It turns your Xbox One into your own personal
[5749.21s -> 5751.45s]  and free X Cloud server.
[5752.73s -> 5754.50s]  This shit never works though.
[5754.50s -> 5757.46s]  Whether you're using a console in our data center
[5757.46s -> 5761.22s]  or your console at home, this October,
[5761.22s -> 5764.26s]  you'll be able to use our hybrid gaming cloud
[5764.26s -> 5766.90s]  to play your games wherever you go.
[5767.14s -> 5770.74s]  Yeah, but the same thing with the Google thing too.
[5770.74s -> 5772.34s]  It's like the latency is not good enough yet.
[5772.34s -> 5774.90s]  Where you play is now entirely your choice.
[5774.90s -> 5775.62s]  You decide.
[5777.03s -> 5779.19s]  So let's talk about our next console.
[5785.21s -> 5790.09s]  For us, the console is vital and central to our experience.
[5791.13s -> 5791.85s]  We heard you.
[5792.57s -> 5797.05s]  A console should be designed and built and optimized
[5797.05s -> 5800.73s]  for one thing and one thing only, gaming.
[5802.30s -> 5805.18s]  So they're going to strip all the other shit from Xbox.
[5805.18s -> 5808.70s]  The same team that created the world's most powerful console,
[5808.70s -> 5813.58s]  Xbox One X, and innovated its groundbreaking processor
[5813.58s -> 5815.02s]  and the elite controller.
[5815.58s -> 5819.98s]  The same team that engineered the world-class compatibility
[5819.98s -> 5822.14s]  of today's Xbox One consoles.
[5822.86s -> 5827.02s]  The same team that set the bar for live gaming services
[5827.02s -> 5828.14s]  with Xbox Live.
[5829.02s -> 5832.46s]  This same team, the Xbox Lizard on a new mission
[5833.50s -> 5835.82s]  to create the future of gaming for you.
[5839.88s -> 5842.04s]  When we think about the future of gaming,
[5842.04s -> 5844.68s]  it's not just PC, it's not just console,
[5844.68s -> 5845.88s]  it's not just mobile.
[5845.88s -> 5847.64s]  It's really all of the above.
[5847.64s -> 5849.00s]  Xbox is all about choice.
[5849.00s -> 5852.44s]  We're investing in technology all throughout the game stack.
[5852.44s -> 5853.88s]  The games you want with the people you want
[5853.88s -> 5855.08s]  on the devices that you want.
[5855.08s -> 5856.36s]  Xbox on the blockchain.
[5856.36s -> 5858.76s]  It's going to be like Xbox Crystal.
[5860.44s -> 5862.44s]  We don't want to build just an Xbox console.
[5862.44s -> 5864.68s]  We truly want it to be transformative.
[5864.68s -> 5868.68s]  More immersion, more exploration, more detail.
[5868.68s -> 5870.36s]  How do we make it easier for people
[5870.36s -> 5872.12s]  to get into the game, to stay in the game?
[5872.12s -> 5874.12s]  One of the things that gamers and developers
[5874.12s -> 5877.16s]  are incredibly excited about is reducing load times.
[5877.16s -> 5882.20s]  I'm an RPG gamer, and so like loading screens are a thing.
[5882.20s -> 5883.96s]  Sitting there in the big elevator,
[5883.96s -> 5885.96s]  because you know that the game's loading in the background.
[5885.96s -> 5888.20s]  That's just an elevator ride forever.
[5888.20s -> 5889.48s]  That's our goal with gaming,
[5889.48s -> 5891.08s]  is that you don't have those pauses.
[5891.08s -> 5893.16s]  This generation is going to be a bigger leap
[5893.16s -> 5894.92s]  than any generation we've done before.
[5897.13s -> 5899.29s]  At the heart of our next generation console
[5899.29s -> 5901.13s]  is our custom design processor,
[5901.13s -> 5904.09s]  leveraging the latest Zen 2 and Navi technology
[5904.09s -> 5906.01s]  from our partners at AMD.
[5906.01s -> 5908.09s]  From a pure processing perspective,
[5908.09s -> 5911.29s]  this is four times more powerful than the Xbox One X.
[5911.29s -> 5914.01s]  We're leveraging high bandwidth GDDR6
[5914.01s -> 5916.89s]  to ensure that we're getting the best performance possible.
[5916.97s -> 5919.77s]  It's going to usher in resolution and frame rates
[5919.77s -> 5921.29s]  that we've never seen before.
[5921.29s -> 5922.49s]  It will burn you.
[5922.49s -> 5923.61s]  If you touch it, it'll burn you.
[5923.61s -> 5927.05s]  Look at frame rates, up to 120 frames per second.
[5927.05s -> 5928.73s]  8K capability.
[5928.73s -> 5930.09s]  Variable refresh rate.
[5930.09s -> 5931.61s]  Next-gen ray tracing.
[5931.61s -> 5937.46s]  It's real time because it's hardware accelerated
[5937.46s -> 5938.82s]  for the first time ever.
[5938.82s -> 5941.70s]  What I'm personally most excited about is the SSD.
[5943.34s -> 5946.78s]  We've created a new generation of SSDs.
[5946.78s -> 5949.66s]  We're actually using the SSD as virtual RAM.
[5949.98s -> 5952.70s]  We're seeing more than 40 times performance increases
[5952.70s -> 5954.30s]  over the current generation.
[5954.30s -> 5956.86s]  The combination of the SoC and the solid-state drive
[5956.86s -> 5959.26s]  are really what gives you a totally new experience.
[5959.26s -> 5960.78s]  Now we can take all of that power
[5960.78s -> 5962.38s]  and apply it back into the scene.
[5962.38s -> 5964.94s]  So we can actually generate more life in that world
[5964.94s -> 5967.26s]  and bring it to the gamer in a seamless way
[5967.26s -> 5968.94s]  so that then you're fully experiencing
[5968.94s -> 5970.94s]  what the game developer wants you to experience.
[5970.94s -> 5972.54s]  When you can move through worlds
[5972.54s -> 5975.26s]  without waiting for screens to load that speed,
[5975.26s -> 5977.42s]  that performance is what the next generation is about.
[5977.42s -> 5979.90s]  Sony fanboys backing up into a corner.
[5979.90s -> 5981.58s]  Sony fanboys backing up, right?
[5984.01s -> 5985.29s]  Sony fanboys get your story.
[6008.81s -> 6011.77s]  The next generation, we can bring the world to life
[6011.77s -> 6013.93s]  in a way we've never experienced Halo before.
[6014.97s -> 6017.88s]  We're delivering four generations of content
[6017.88s -> 6019.88s]  better than you've ever seen them before.
[6019.88s -> 6022.76s]  This console is especially awesome for Game Pass members.
[6022.76s -> 6024.20s]  With the faster load times,
[6024.20s -> 6026.36s]  you're going to be able to experience all the games
[6026.36s -> 6028.36s]  within just snap of your fingers.
[6028.36s -> 6030.20s]  We're giving gamers the option
[6030.20s -> 6032.60s]  to connect across devices and across platforms.
[6032.60s -> 6033.72s]  It's going to be able to talk to it.
[6033.72s -> 6035.00s]  In a way that we never were able to before.
[6035.00s -> 6036.52s]  This isn't just a console launch.
[6036.60s -> 6039.88s]  Alexa, it's going to be like Janet.
[6040.68s -> 6041.64s]  Xbox, Janet.
[6041.64s -> 6045.00s]  Your accessories, your console gaming experience with Xbox.
[6045.00s -> 6046.76s]  It all comes forward with Scarlett.
[6046.76s -> 6052.76s]  The T, the Scarlett, the Xbox Scarlett.
[6052.76s -> 6053.96s]  Scarlett, yes.
[6053.96s -> 6056.20s]  It eats monsters for breakfast.
[6056.20s -> 6057.16s]  Here we go.
[6057.16s -> 6057.96s]  You're going to be able to talk to it.
[6057.96s -> 6058.84s]  It's going to be able to do attacks.
[6058.84s -> 6060.52s]  It's going to be able to order Amazon orders for you.
[6060.52s -> 6061.48s]  This is Project Scarlett.
[6062.46s -> 6065.50s]  The most powerful and highest performing console
[6065.50s -> 6066.78s]  we've ever designed.
[6067.82s -> 6071.50s]  Built for creators to unleash their boldest creative visions
[6072.14s -> 6074.38s]  and optimized for players
[6074.38s -> 6076.78s]  to enjoy the ultimate gaming experience
[6076.78s -> 6078.38s]  on a console anywhere.
[6079.58s -> 6082.86s]  Immersive experiences begin at the very heart
[6082.86s -> 6085.34s]  of the console, at the silicon level itself.
[6086.22s -> 6088.54s]  Together with our partners at AMD,
[6088.54s -> 6091.50s]  we have co-engineered and custom designed
[6091.50s -> 6094.38s]  a state of the art processor for Project Scarlett.
[6094.38s -> 6099.50s]  Does it have a CD tray?
[6100.06s -> 6104.06s]  Power you could see define previous generations.
[6104.86s -> 6108.22s]  Power and performance you can see and feel
[6108.78s -> 6110.38s]  defines Project Scarlett.
[6111.56s -> 6113.40s]  When we talk about freedom to play,
[6114.28s -> 6116.36s]  when we talk about Xbox in the cloud,
[6117.00s -> 6119.00s]  when we talk about streaming your games,
[6119.88s -> 6123.00s]  Project Scarlett and all of its power
[6123.00s -> 6126.92s]  and all of its performance is the foundation
[6126.92s -> 6128.28s]  of our future in console
[6129.32s -> 6132.84s]  and the formation of our future in cloud.
[6133.40s -> 6135.08s]  Latency has got to get better though.
[6135.08s -> 6137.64s]  We launched Xbox 18 years ago
[6138.52s -> 6140.76s]  with the game reviewers called
[6140.76s -> 6143.48s]  the definitive reason to own an Xbox.
[6144.68s -> 6148.20s]  Well, because humanity was and is worth saving.
[6149.32s -> 6152.44s]  Next holiday, we will launch Project Scarlett
[6153.16s -> 6153.72s]  with Halo.
[6155.16s -> 6156.44s]  Wait, did you just make like a,
[6156.44s -> 6158.04s]  this is going to save humanity?
[6159.61s -> 6161.13s]  Oh, it's the Halo, okay.
[6163.77s -> 6164.97s]  Humanity is worth saving.
[6164.97s -> 6166.65s]  That's why we made the Scarlett.
[6166.65s -> 6169.13s]  We're going to save the world.
[6213.85s -> 6222.44s]  Oh, that was a Pratt fall.
[6222.44s -> 6223.96s]  That was like a WWE fall.
[6225.91s -> 6227.51s]  You get like pushed off the top rope.
[6231.64s -> 6232.52s]  Daddy's listening.
[6233.24s -> 6233.96s]  Can you say hi?
[6235.62s -> 6236.42s]  And how big are you?
[6236.42s -> 6237.38s]  I'm baby.
[6237.38s -> 6238.82s]  Can you tell daddy how big you are?
[6238.82s -> 6239.14s]  Two.
[6239.14s -> 6241.30s]  Are you so big?
[6241.30s -> 6242.02s]  You're big.
[6243.30s -> 6244.18s]  And can you sing?
[6246.34s -> 6247.22s]  Good singing.
[6247.78s -> 6249.30s]  How about I miss you.
[6250.90s -> 6251.62s]  And I love you.
[6253.06s -> 6254.02s]  And love you, daddy.
[6255.86s -> 6256.98s]  And I can't wait to see you.
[6257.86s -> 6258.74s]  Can you say see you?
[6260.74s -> 6261.70s]  Bye bye.
[6282.14s -> 6286.34s]  Is this Halo?
[6302.57s -> 6305.21s]  This is UNSC Pelican Echo 216.
[6305.21s -> 6305.85s]  Can you hear me?
[6307.98s -> 6308.86s]  This is UNSC.
[6309.98s -> 6313.38s]  Is he talking to him?
[6313.38s -> 6314.26s]  Who is talking to him?
[6314.90s -> 6316.26s]  He's like, look over here, I'm floating.
[6317.14s -> 6318.39s]  Is that who's talking?
[6318.95s -> 6339.96s]  Looks like the main power cells are fried.
[6341.32s -> 6342.52s]  Armor shut down.
[6342.52s -> 6343.24s]  Is he still in there?
[6343.24s -> 6344.36s]  Triggering survival mode.
[6345.80s -> 6348.55s]  I'm going to try to overwrite.
[6349.59s -> 6356.25s]  Okay, if you can hear me in there, I hope you're ready.
[6357.61s -> 6358.65s]  Please don't die.
[6358.65s -> 6360.81s]  Here comes the plug the two codes together.
[6366.38s -> 6368.06s]  It's Keanu Reeves.
[6369.98s -> 6372.94s]  Hey, how long was I asleep for?
[6374.22s -> 6375.58s]  Hopefully not too long.
[6375.58s -> 6376.38s]  We're going home.
[6376.38s -> 6383.03s]  Back, chief.
[6383.03s -> 6387.38s]  I rerouted what little power I had into your suit.
[6387.38s -> 6389.46s]  Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back.
[6390.02s -> 6391.86s]  Looks like there's a problem with the servos in your hands.
[6393.40s -> 6394.28s]  Stay calm.
[6394.28s -> 6395.24s]  You've been out there a while.
[6395.80s -> 6401.02s]  I know I saw something in you to check your armor's diagnostics.
[6402.06s -> 6406.49s]  AI knock detection.
[6410.23s -> 6410.95s]  That would hurt.
[6410.95s -> 6412.39s]  Easy there, big guy.
[6412.39s -> 6412.95s]  You're not.
[6412.95s -> 6413.75s]  Status report.
[6414.71s -> 6415.75s]  Status report.
[6415.75s -> 6416.31s]  He talks?
[6416.31s -> 6416.81s]  What?
[6417.67s -> 6419.91s]  There's something you need to see, chief.
[6426.89s -> 6428.01s]  Yeah, I didn't know.
[6428.01s -> 6429.21s]  I've never played Halo.
[6430.81s -> 6434.25s]  I haven't ever played one second of fucking Halo.
[6434.25s -> 6434.97s]  I don't know.
[6434.97s -> 6435.69s]  We lost.
[6435.69s -> 6437.56s]  We lost everything.
[6437.56s -> 6441.46s]  We're frozen.
[6441.46s -> 6443.30s]  Flat earth confirmed.
[6443.30s -> 6445.39s]  Race.
[6446.41s -> 6448.25s]  Oh no, that's the Halo.
[6448.25s -> 6449.21s]  Right, okay, sorry.
[6450.17s -> 6452.60s]  No, no, nothing.
[6452.60s -> 6455.69s]  We need to run.
[6456.33s -> 6474.54s]  We need to fight.
[6474.54s -> 6475.26s]  Infinite.
[6481.62s -> 6482.58s]  I didn't know Halo talked.
[6483.14s -> 6483.86s]  Well, whatever.
[6483.86s -> 6485.54s]  The fucking chef, whatever his name is.
[6487.67s -> 6489.19s]  Gordon Ramsay's Master Chief.
[6491.26s -> 6492.38s]  I'm fucking this up for everybody.
[6492.38s -> 6493.10s]  I'm going to quiet down.
[6493.66s -> 6497.05s]  I chose you because you were special.
[6497.69s -> 6507.26s]  Right?
[6516.28s -> 6517.40s]  Pretty cool, new Halo.
[6519.26s -> 6523.90s]  And the Terminator is going to be in this expansion for Halo.
[6525.26s -> 6526.54s]  Oh, that's too bad.
[6526.54s -> 6537.72s]  Master Chief's most ambitious villain.
[6537.72s -> 6538.68s]  Adversary yet.
[6539.56s -> 6540.44s]  The Terminator.
[6549.88s -> 6550.76s]  So what did we get?
[6552.62s -> 6555.98s]  We had Battle Toads.
[6555.98s -> 6559.34s]  Looks, yeah, I'm not so sure, but maybe it'll be fun.
[6560.38s -> 6561.58s]  Phantasy Star Online 2.
[6562.30s -> 6562.78s]  Big deal.
[6562.78s -> 6563.74s]  Minecraft Diablo.
[6563.74s -> 6564.30s]  Pretty big deal.
[6567.10s -> 6569.30s]  That's pretty good.
[6569.94s -> 6571.22s]  And Madden.
[6571.22s -> 6572.18s]  Don't forget about Madden.
[6572.98s -> 6577.11s]  I wonder how much money Madden paid to be part of this trailer.
[6578.28s -> 6580.04s]  Because why would you put that here?
[6581.02s -> 6585.02s]  There is no reason in a million fucking years
[6585.02s -> 6589.10s]  why you would put Madden in your trailer for E3 like it was a big deal.
[6589.10s -> 6592.14s]  They come out every year, every single year.
[6592.14s -> 6593.82s]  There is no difference, there's no announcement.
[6595.64s -> 6596.44s]  Why would it be here?
[6597.16s -> 6606.18s]  I'm looking forward to that Minecraft Diablo game.
[6606.90s -> 6613.34s]  I mean, that's cool, but I didn't play Halo.
[6613.34s -> 6614.30s]  I never played any of it.
[6614.94s -> 6618.55s]  Are we going to get like a send-off?
[6622.68s -> 6623.16s]  There it is.
[6624.41s -> 6626.73s]  Hey, now, what was, let me ask you this question.
[6626.73s -> 6628.81s]  What was your favorite game that was at E3?
[6628.81s -> 6630.01s]  Put it in the comments section below.
[6631.69s -> 6632.19s]  Hey!
[6633.85s -> 6637.05s]  Man, that was a hell of a conference.
[6637.05s -> 6637.69s]  It was.
[6637.69s -> 6638.41s]  It was a hell of a conference.
[6638.41s -> 6639.45s]  They showed a lot of stuff.
[6639.45s -> 6640.01s]  I'm going to pull up.
[6640.01s -> 6643.85s]  We had, I'm trying to run it down a dock with everything shown.
[6644.73s -> 6646.33s]  Welcome, everyone, once again from Slash.
[6646.49s -> 6646.97s]  Welcome, guys.
[6648.81s -> 6650.57s]  Where do you even begin with that?
[6650.57s -> 6651.53s]  I don't know, Joe.
[6651.53s -> 6652.25s]  Like, seriously.
[6652.25s -> 6653.77s]  Do we start with Keanu fucking Reeves?
[6653.77s -> 6654.17s]  I know!
[6654.17s -> 6655.29s]  How crazy was that?
[6656.17s -> 6656.81s]  Unbelievable.
[6656.81s -> 6657.77s]  Isn't that the entire thing?
[6657.77s -> 6658.73s]  Isn't that what's to say?
[6659.45s -> 6660.81s]  I can't believe they did that.
[6660.81s -> 6661.53s]  God damn it.
[6662.87s -> 6663.43s]  I think.
[6663.43s -> 6665.83s]  Yeah, I'm going to try to find that trailer real quick.
[6665.83s -> 6668.55s]  Co, walk us through your thoughts on what you saw from Cyberpunk.
[6668.55s -> 6669.27s]  I'll walk you through it.
[6669.27s -> 6672.79s]  So Cyberpunk was seriously, there was so much there.
[6673.35s -> 6675.35s]  I know, I had the same reaction.
[6675.35s -> 6679.83s]  I had the same reaction when I saw for the first time.
[6679.83s -> 6681.19s]  Rational thought right now.
[6681.19s -> 6682.15s]  That's what I thought.
[6682.15s -> 6682.79s]  Yeah.
[6682.79s -> 6683.35s]  Oh my God.
[6683.35s -> 6685.27s]  Did they put that trailer out, by the way?
[6685.27s -> 6686.07s]  Yes, yes, they did.
[6686.07s -> 6686.71s]  If I could find it.
[6687.51s -> 6689.11s]  I looked up where it was going on.
[6689.11s -> 6690.07s]  That was the thing.
[6690.07s -> 6691.03s]  But we got to see it for the first time.
[6691.03s -> 6691.91s]  We actually got to see it.
[6691.91s -> 6693.83s]  Keanu motherfucking Reeves!
[6693.83s -> 6694.23s]  Where did that come from?
[6694.23s -> 6694.87s]  Hell yeah!
[6694.87s -> 6695.35s]  I don't know.
[6695.35s -> 6696.71s]  Like, how was that not leaked?
[6696.71s -> 6697.91s]  Or how did that work?
[6697.91s -> 6698.95s]  That's the best kept secret.
[6698.95s -> 6699.59s]  Unbelievable.
[6699.59s -> 6700.23s]  100%.
[6701.03s -> 6702.87s]  Now, Joe, I'm going to tell you something, Joe.
[6702.87s -> 6705.03s]  At that point, all the other leaks seemed like they were not
[6705.99s -> 6706.79s]  I know, right?
[6706.79s -> 6707.51s]  It was, it's odd.
[6707.51s -> 6709.35s]  I got the papers, y'all.
[6710.95s -> 6713.35s]  I am fucking shaking a little bit after that one.
[6713.35s -> 6717.67s]  Those leaks were on purpose or actually accidental or whatever.
[6718.23s -> 6720.63s]  I'm sure they were like, don't even worry about that.
[6720.63s -> 6722.39s]  Don't even worry about those other fucking leaks.
[6722.39s -> 6725.35s]  As long as Keanu doesn't get out, that shit doesn't get out.
[6725.35s -> 6726.39s]  That's the most important.
[6726.39s -> 6728.15s]  That's the most important one.
[6728.15s -> 6730.31s]  I loved how much fun he was having.
[6730.31s -> 6731.11s]  Yeah, he was having a great time.
[6731.11s -> 6732.55s]  He was having fun on that stage.
[6732.55s -> 6734.31s]  It was just, he was just there.
[6734.47s -> 6735.59s]  Guys, I gotta take a shit.
[6735.59s -> 6736.23s]  I'll be back.
[6736.23s -> 6737.51s]  Just keep doing the podcast without me.
[6737.51s -> 6740.07s]  I'm going to go shit my pants if I don't get out of here.
[6740.07s -> 6740.39s]  Yeah.
[6740.39s -> 6741.35s]  I'll be back in like five minutes.
[6743.35s -> 6745.27s]  That's all you had to do is just say cyberpunk.
[6745.27s -> 6747.03s]  Just hang out, Keanu Reeves.
[6747.03s -> 6747.91s]  It was good.
[6747.91s -> 6748.47s]  It was good.
[6750.07s -> 6752.47s]  Could you even think of something that would be more hyped than that?
[6754.30s -> 6755.50s]  That might actually appear.
[6755.50s -> 6756.30s]  That might actually happen.
[6757.98s -> 6758.62s]  I haven't left yet.
[6758.62s -> 6760.38s]  I am going to shit my pants about it.
[6760.38s -> 6761.42s]  Let me get this out before I go.
[6761.42s -> 6764.54s]  That was even on the board for something that could happen.
[6764.54s -> 6767.10s]  Well, because they linked it to me, actually.
[6767.10s -> 6768.70s]  I'm the only one that knew about that.
[6768.70s -> 6769.50s]  Well, we know.
[6769.50s -> 6771.50s]  Hell, I gotta go real bad.
[6771.50s -> 6772.14s]  All right, all right.
[6772.14s -> 6772.54s]  I'm done.
[6773.26s -> 6774.78s]  With John Wick hacks as well.
[6777.46s -> 6779.22s]  I forgot about fucking the Elven Ring.
[6779.22s -> 6780.18s]  That looks amazing, too.
[6780.82s -> 6784.94s]  There's a lot of stuff that looks really great.
[6784.94s -> 6785.98s]  But I actually do have to pee.
[6787.26s -> 6789.18s]  When I get back, here's the plan.
[6789.18s -> 6790.22s]  For those of you that are wondering.
[6792.01s -> 6793.13s]  I am going to play...
[6794.70s -> 6795.50s]  We'll hang out for a little bit.
[6795.50s -> 6800.41s]  I'm going to play Cooking Simulator for like an hour or two.
[6801.05s -> 6803.24s]  And then we're going to do the Bethesda Conference as well.
[6803.80s -> 6804.68s]  So let me just take a piss.
[6804.68s -> 6805.24s]  I'll be right back.
[6806.04s -> 6807.00s]  I'll see you guys real soon.
[6809.69s -> 6810.41s]  Don't go anywhere.
[6811.14s -> 6812.98s]  Unless you do.
[6812.98s -> 6814.34s]  In that case, hope you have a good day.
[6814.34s -> 6815.06s]  See you soon.
