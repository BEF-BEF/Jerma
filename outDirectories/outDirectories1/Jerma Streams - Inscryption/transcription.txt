[4.34s -> 12.22s]  My mic wasn't plugged in. I hope it sounds okay, because it was not plugged in. And I just jammed
[12.22s -> 17.54s]  it in and pressed start now. Why was this not plugged in? I was sitting there going,
[17.54s -> 35.90s]  why can't I not hear anything? Stream sucks. Hi guys. How you doing? Welcome back. Somebody said,
[35.90s -> 44.57s]  we can only be so patient, Andy. Are you talking about me? We can wait, are you talking about you?
[44.57s -> 52.12s]  You're the, we can only be so patient, Andy. Or are you calling me Andy? Like we can only be so
[52.12s -> 61.37s]  patient, Andy. I'm trying. What does that one mean? Hey, what's up green? Oh, I just dropped that.
[62.82s -> 72.52s]  I'm fine. Promise us you won't be late next time. I'm late every single time. But here's the thing.
[76.31s -> 84.20s]  Look, it's time for defense. It's time for defense. When my stream turns on, I'm here.
[84.92s -> 95.54s]  It's like, boom. Data goes in. 30 seconds later. What's up? I don't got a 20 minute countdown.
[95.54s -> 99.85s]  I don't have a 10 to 15 minute countdown on screen. I don't have a 30 minute countdown.
[99.85s -> 112.01s]  I'm here and I'm ready when I press that button. See? That's true. What's your point?
[112.01s -> 123.42s]  You can't true me and then say, you can't true me and then say, what's the point? I like this method.
[124.49s -> 136.98s]  I'm here and I'm ready. True but not based. Is that possible? How does that work? You could be true
[136.98s -> 145.93s]  but not based. Is that how that works? Who makes these rules, by the way? Anyways, today we're
[145.93s -> 153.70s]  going to play Inscription. It's the, that scary card game that I've heard all about. Seems pretty
[153.70s -> 158.25s]  crazy. I don't know anything about it besides it exists. And I know that I'm kind of late to the
[158.25s -> 162.98s]  party here, but that's good for you because you get to see all the funny moments when I get scared
[162.98s -> 167.30s]  by the cards that pop out and jump scare me or something because you've played this game.
[169.40s -> 175.03s]  And we're starting late today. Well, I told you we're going to stream maybe on Monday or Tuesday.
[175.75s -> 181.61s]  So here we are on Monday. I had stuff to do earlier this afternoon, but I'm here now.
[185.59s -> 193.21s]  Also going to be live tomorrow too and make that clear. So they'll be streamed tomorrow.
[194.33s -> 197.45s]  I want to do, there's a few things that are going to happen here over the next couple of days.
[198.09s -> 203.29s]  I want to make it very clear what the kind of plan is. I'll reiterate it a little bit later, but
[205.59s -> 217.80s]  Ludwig and I want to do that Elden Ring PvP kind of community champions night. So I am going to do
[217.80s -> 224.73s]  in the next day or so, we're going to do Elden Ring PvP again. And I've got to find my champions
[225.99s -> 238.63s]  because I'm not fighting Ludwig. We're picking champions. So I got to make sure I get the right
[238.63s -> 246.79s]  ones. Yeah, I already know a few. I already know a few that I need to find and get, you know,
[246.79s -> 255.59s]  find them. But maybe not. Maybe tomorrow or Wednesday. I'm not sure yet. I'll figure it out.
[256.58s -> 267.86s]  But I am holding what is essentially tryouts. We're going to see if we can make it work.
[267.86s -> 285.94s]  Do an IRL Elden Ring stream or just like dodge roll stuff. You know, actually kind of funny.
[289.10s -> 297.51s]  But don't like one guy me and make me like, go get like sponsors and make me spend
[297.51s -> 303.96s]  fucking hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up like I'm doing like I'm going to I'm
[303.96s -> 307.40s]  like in a Dark Souls dungeon, like going and picking up items and have to dodge roll shit.
[309.59s -> 311.67s]  Don't I don't you're going to make me you're going to make me go do that.
[312.39s -> 319.78s]  Are you going to make me do that? Like I then there's a boss at the end that I have to fight
[321.48s -> 339.05s]  and I die like fucking 50 times. That's so stupid. No one's forcing you. It would be a LARP.
[340.90s -> 345.06s]  I'd have to get I'd have to go and get the shortcut and stuff. Would that even
[345.06s -> 355.54s]  last more than like an hour? Have like two or three bosses and have like a main boss at the end.
[356.26s -> 365.66s]  I would want to include chat somehow, though, and just train and do do animations as a person
[365.66s -> 380.47s]  in real life. Have idle animations, LARP stream, IRL fall joke. Yeah, I walk off a cliff and fucking
[380.47s -> 394.68s]  die. A little fake, but you know, just sit there and chug and estus and then get killed in one hit.
[399.98s -> 406.84s]  OK, all right. Well, here's the thing. I'm going to write this down because this is this is really
[406.84s -> 413.77s]  stupid and I kind of I kind of want to like explore this a little bit and be in full armor.
[419.70s -> 428.58s]  This would be oh, this is going to be fucking a little hard, though, but our chat will spawn
[428.58s -> 442.84s]  enemies. Oh, good. You haven't started yet. I was heating up my. Yeah, this is going to be expensive.
[442.84s -> 452.94s]  Whatever I the cost of a show does not bother me. It's being able to actually pay for it.
[455.53s -> 460.01s]  I'll actually be able to dodge IRL and I'm going to tell these actors are going to be like fucking
[460.01s -> 465.48s]  try to hit me with that axe. I'm not kidding. I don't want this to be like, oh, we're actors.
[465.48s -> 470.12s]  Oh, I'm like swinging really slowly. No, try to fucking hit me with that axe and I'm going
[470.12s -> 478.73s]  to dodge it. You know what I mean? Like I got to go all in. Not a real axe. No, not
[480.97s -> 488.18s]  not a real axe, guys. I'm saying I will. Maybe I like foam or something, whatever it is.
[489.34s -> 495.05s]  But I want that person. I want it to be. I don't want to be like, oh, I'm swinging and you're going
[495.05s -> 500.89s]  to put your hand up and block it. And I know you are. So we're both going to go two miles per hour.
[501.37s -> 506.73s]  And pretend to hit each other. No, I want this to look fucking crazy. I want it to look good.
[506.73s -> 511.43s]  I want that actor to fucking try to hit me as hard as he can. I'm going to take that actor aside
[511.43s -> 515.91s]  and be like, hey, what's up, man? Um, this little this foam thing, like keep practice. Just hit me
[515.91s -> 520.71s]  like in the back with it like five times. It's going to be like, that doesn't hurt. That doesn't
[520.71s -> 525.03s]  hurt that much. All right. I want you to hit me in the head. And I mean, like, I'm going to be
[525.03s -> 534.50s]  dodging it. It's going to be real. I'm method acting. This shit's going to be made out of like
[534.58s -> 538.42s]  fucking pillows and foam, guys. We're going to make sure that doesn't hurt. We're going to make
[538.42s -> 549.83s]  sure it's like it's like getting hit by air. Jack gets to choose the stats you level up. Well,
[549.83s -> 558.76s]  they can't. I don't think sorcery could exist. Don't worry. He's an expert at hand to hand combat.
[562.22s -> 568.31s]  I'm not. What about lightning bolts? I mean, I could get, I guess we could make it interesting.
[568.95s -> 580.07s]  Fireworks. Casting one glint stone bolt at somebody and I have to light up like a Roman
[580.07s -> 583.43s]  candle or something. No, that's not. I'm not shooting. That's dangerous. I don't want to do
[583.43s -> 603.24s]  that. I'm not doing anything that could actually hurt anybody. We'll figure it out. Use a flashlight.
[603.88s -> 607.08s]  That would actually be kind of funny. Well, like a little pretend like,
[612.58s -> 617.86s]  yeah, I actually kind of like this idea. And here's the problem, though. This is the bad part.
[619.29s -> 625.45s]  This was a great idea six months ago. So a week or two after Elden Ring came out, I could do this
[625.45s -> 632.76s]  stream. This is now going to be about four to six months of planning. And Elden Ring is going to
[632.76s -> 640.39s]  kind of be in the rear view for a lot of people, I think, in a year. It doesn't have to be like a
[640.39s -> 646.15s]  from software kind of parody. It's just an action adventure dungeon that is very heavily inspired
[646.79s -> 655.14s]  by Dark Souls. All right, I'm writing it down. I actually am. I'm actually writing it down
[655.14s -> 662.42s]  because this could be like fun. Bringing a bunch of set designers and make a Dark Souls dungeon.
[662.50s -> 673.32s]  This is actually, yeah, I think I could make this work. All right. See you in like a year
[673.32s -> 681.96s]  when the guy in chat goes, hey, I said IRL Elden Ring. And and he spent $400,000 on a stream.
[682.60s -> 710.18s]  You thank that guy. All right. So anyways, we're going to get into inscription. IRL
[710.82s -> 717.14s]  millennia. It actually would be so funny if I kept dying to a boss and I was just
[717.14s -> 723.14s]  yelling into the camera, like talking shit to the camera. Like this is fucking bullshit.
[723.14s -> 728.10s]  This boss sucks. That mechanic is absolutely broken. I complained for like 10 minutes into
[728.10s -> 734.06s]  the camera. And then like while I'm complaining, I'm backing up and I just drop like off the cliff
[734.06s -> 743.08s]  and it says like you died. Oh, this could be good. Oh, this could be very good. I'm actually really
[743.08s -> 758.34s]  into this. All right, I'm not gonna tell you anything else. Can you help me with my chemistry
[758.34s -> 763.91s]  homework? No, I don't really know anything about chemistry. Okay, inscription. Here it is.
[768.66s -> 782.73s]  Let's do it. Hi. So how does this game work? It's a scary game. This is a scary game. I get
[782.73s -> 793.42s]  the Pac-Man shirt on it. All right. This is a scary game. Lights off. It's it's not dark yet.
[793.42s -> 819.64s]  The lights aren't even like on. This is not a lights off game. Don't do that. It's a PC.
[819.64s -> 833.82s]  This is an old PC. I'm sorry. That was fucking horrible. Inscription. Turn the lights up. I'm
[833.82s -> 841.75s]  not I can't turn the lights off. I'm not stealing this from like XQC's community. Okay. Like, oh,
[841.75s -> 864.12s]  lights off. Oh, I love that guy. Yeah. Oh, yep. Oh, cool. See, I do too. This makes me look weird.
[864.12s -> 869.30s]  Cat. This is not a lights off game. Is that my? Okay, whatever. Okay. New game options.
[869.30s -> 876.38s]  Do I turn anything up or down? What should I do here? Flicker FX. Nope. Screen shake. No,
[876.38s -> 883.51s]  thank you. Tech speed. That's probably fine. Noise effect. Turn that off. Full screen, please. And
[883.51s -> 888.47s]  let's get it on ultra brightness. Turn the brightness up a little bit so it's not so dark.
[888.47s -> 898.58s]  What do you mean why? I don't like when any of that shit is in my games. No, I don't like it. I
[898.58s -> 909.11s]  don't like when anything's like put screen shake on maximum. All right. Music volume. I always turn
[909.11s -> 914.92s]  it down. That should be fine. Like that. Turn the noise back on. All right. I'm going to turn the
[914.92s -> 927.37s]  noise back on. If I don't like it, it's going off immediately. Okay, let's go. Like I can't start a
[927.37s -> 961.34s]  new game. Why? Continue. I haven't played this. I haven't played this game. A little challenger.
[961.42s -> 962.38s]  It has been ages.
[967.78s -> 968.42s]  Voice acting.
[972.41s -> 977.59s]  Does it matter where?
[988.38s -> 989.58s]  So I have to... Okay.
[996.62s -> 997.98s]  Okay, this is one attack, three health.
[1008.63s -> 1009.11s]  Unopposed.
[1014.06s -> 1017.80s]  Yeah, okay. Just like Hearthstone.
[1029.43s -> 1040.86s]  Like this. My turn. Okay, your stoat stands in the way of my coyote. Two. All right, so I live.
[1040.86s -> 1048.14s]  My coyote took two damage to your stoat. That means your stoat's health is two less. How come
[1048.14s -> 1050.14s]  that didn't kill it? These aren't Hearthstone rules.
[1058.74s -> 1067.06s]  Your turn. You may draw from your deck or you may draw a squirrel. Which doesn't matter.
[1067.93s -> 1074.23s]  Again, I'm going to draw a squirrel. How dull. Well, no, because if I played the squirrel,
[1074.23s -> 1082.34s]  then the wolf can come up and sacrifice two people. Okay, so let's put a squirrel out there.
[1082.34s -> 1092.97s]  And then I'm going to play the wolf right here. Drop the wolf down. Suffering. Suffering was real,
[1092.97s -> 1104.46s]  but you will see it again. Okay, got the wolf out. That's it, right? Because you are learning,
[1104.46s -> 1110.23s]  I will pass. Again, the choice. A random card from your deck or the certainty of a squirrel.
[1114.17s -> 1123.03s]  Let me just take a random card. A river snapper. Can I see what it does? I can't do anything.
[1124.15s -> 1135.88s]  Oh, shit. Three weights on the scale. Pass. Squirrel. Put squirrel out. Back it up. Pass.
[1136.68s -> 1150.73s]  I win. I won this match. They won't all be so easy. Let me recall your story. Oh, yes.
[1151.93s -> 1165.70s]  Pale blood, you say. You were lost deep in the forest. A single path revealed itself.
[1165.70s -> 1173.45s]  Two denizens of the forest approached you tentatively. Okay. A cat. The undying cat
[1173.45s -> 1181.70s]  sacrificing the poor beast does not kill it. A caustic adder. Damage from its poison bite
[1181.70s -> 1197.70s]  is always lethal. Only one may grace your paltry deck. Snake or cat. I feel like the adder. Everyone's
[1197.70s -> 1201.78s]  saying cat. Is it cat? I thought I would assume it would be snake. Oh, there's only one sacrifice
[1201.78s -> 1223.11s]  needed. Turn the music up. This is gonna go, dude. I'll take the cat. Sure. Another creature
[1223.11s -> 1237.86s]  joins your caravan. Some of the creatures of the forest seemed willing to follow you. You came
[1237.86s -> 1245.32s]  across an abandoned sack. You found a squirrel in a bottle. Break it in case of an emergency.
[1245.32s -> 1253.77s]  And I have a second. Another useful implement. I'll allow you to tip the scales with it. Items?
[1253.77s -> 1261.02s]  Three is as much as you can carry. He's gonna take 10 hours on act one alone. Don't worry.
[1261.02s -> 1272.54s]  You were ambushed while crossing some rough terrain. All right, so let's go.
[1273.50s -> 1283.08s]  You sacrificed me while I was sleeping. It was the right play. I get it. Maybe you'll help me.
[1283.08s -> 1296.71s]  Play along for now. You may now see my moves ahead of time. Um, wolf cub. What does that mean? A card
[1296.71s -> 1300.87s]  bearing this sigil will grow into a more powerful form after one turn on the board. How are we gonna
[1300.87s -> 1306.95s]  get rid of that? What's this? Boulder? It's just in the way. Stump. All right, these things are
[1306.95s -> 1319.40s]  just blocking. So what do we got? I got cat. Uh, I have to put a squirrel up. Squirrel. Uh, squirrel's
[1319.40s -> 1325.50s]  gonna go here. And then that's all I can do, right? Let's go. And turn. Like, wait, do I,
[1325.50s -> 1333.45s]  is there any, is there mana? Mind the ambitious wolf cub that ages swiftly. Is there mana in this
[1333.45s -> 1347.13s]  game? Give me another squirrel. All right, we'll go and squirrel here. And then I'm doing how,
[1347.13s -> 1353.03s]  what is the river snapper? One and six. Okay. I should do the river snapper. Probably. If I
[1353.03s -> 1356.74s]  do river snapper, I can put the river snapper here and then it'll last a long time. Can I move
[1356.74s -> 1366.46s]  the boulder? Oh wait, I'll do cat here instead. Right? Yeah. I think so. I don't know. Because
[1366.46s -> 1382.90s]  this comes back. If this does not perish. Okay. Now, now, now check this out. What? Uh, river
[1382.90s -> 1388.82s]  snapper here or stoat here? Which is better? Probably river snapper. Why not? Listen to your
[1388.82s -> 1438.04s]  mods. What's happening? My mic is rumbling. Wait, what? Hold on. Okay. I think I got it. We good?
[1438.04s -> 1448.39s]  I think we're good. How's this? Are we back? Are we good? Normal? Back? We good? We good? Yeah.
[1448.39s -> 1453.54s]  All right. I don't know why that happened. Sorry about that. All right. So now I'm going,
[1453.54s -> 1455.94s]  I'm just going to go river snapper because it's cool. There's a turtle and I'm going to put it
[1455.94s -> 1461.22s]  right here. Wait, should I sacrifice the cat? I have to do both anyways. I'm going to go over here
[1461.94s -> 1468.57s]  and go. And I'm going to sacrifice this fucking thing and I'm putting this over here.
[1469.21s -> 1482.90s]  Here we go. All right. He's got a bat. The airborne bat flies over creatures to attack directly.
[1482.90s -> 1496.66s]  My bat flew right over your stove. That's stupid. All right. I want a random card. All right. What's
[1496.66s -> 1505.75s]  on the board right now? This will kill this. This is just kind of to be able to feed me,
[1505.75s -> 1513.46s]  but this will kill that. This will, this is going to get through this, but it's all right.
[1513.46s -> 1531.29s]  There are three kills on the board right now. I think I, can I even do anything? I could sacrifice
[1531.29s -> 1541.72s]  these two and put the wolf out. But why would that help? I think I'm just going to pass. Okay.
[1541.72s -> 1548.36s]  And now I'm going to pull out a squirrel. Check this shit out. Squirrel going right here. Wolf
[1548.36s -> 1554.57s]  is going to eat these two. Wolf going down right here. Bingo. Get rid of you. And that should give
[1554.57s -> 1563.21s]  me a one, two, three, four. And here we go. Another wolf. I think I just killed him right now.
[1563.21s -> 1578.06s]  You prevailed and trekked onwards past the now bloody terrain. See? Nobody thought I was going
[1578.06s -> 1593.11s]  to be on that for 10 hours. New card. The young wolf cub grows into a wolf after a single turn.
[1593.11s -> 1611.35s]  A meek sparrow, an inexpensive, if evil flying creature. What do you think chat? This seems
[1611.35s -> 1620.18s]  better, but I kind of like the way that this can just fly over everything. I'll take the wolf.
[1620.18s -> 1624.98s]  That sounds, I mean, nevermind. I was going to say something stupid that would like literally
[1624.98s -> 1634.14s]  be clipped for the rest of my life. What's this? Stumbled into some strange stones in the mist.
[1634.14s -> 1643.45s]  You were compelled to choose a worthy sacrifice. One that will be lost forever. One of the squirrels.
[1643.45s -> 1655.08s]  Oh no. I don't want to get rid of the cat. The cat's like perfect. I don't, I want the cat. The
[1655.08s -> 1672.23s]  cat is just a free mana every time. I kind of like this. I just got this, but it sucks. Pick me.
[1672.23s -> 1682.20s]  Wait, what? Wait, what's going on here? I'm confused. Wait, hold on. Back up. What happened?
[1682.20s -> 1696.02s]  I thought I was sacrificing. What's going on? I'm sacrificing this. What an honor. The ghastly
[1696.02s -> 1703.50s]  spectacle, but the soul of the wolf cub now lives in the stoat. Oh, it like consumes the card and
[1703.90s -> 1715.59s]  I get it. I get it. Okay. Go with the flow, man. Yeah, I got it. I figured out. I hold my totem,
[1715.59s -> 1724.41s]  but it describes my canine cards with the airborne sigil. He's completely insane. You see that,
[1724.41s -> 1732.90s]  right? No pathetic, really no care for his cards. Only keeps me around to watch me suffer.
[1732.90s -> 1744.78s]  He's going to lean forward and it's going to be the sus face. Okay. So let's get a squirrel.
[1744.78s -> 1748.89s]  What do you have? These things can fly. All right. Two and one.
[1748.89s -> 1767.80s]  Back on the board. Okay. I think that's all I can do, right? Oh, it has to. Oh, I get it. Okay.
[1769.59s -> 1773.83s]  I thought, okay, they have to be, it's the card directly in front. It doesn't go all the way back.
[1775.74s -> 1785.59s]  My totem has granted my card the power of flight. I just lost. I need, I need a squirrel right now
[1785.59s -> 1815.70s]  and then what is the wolf? Yeah, wolf. Oh shit. Hold on. Right? Yeah. Am I doing this right?
[1815.70s -> 1826.86s]  This thing can fly. Uh, can I move these around or no? I think I'm going to take a random card.
[1826.86s -> 1843.40s]  Oh, this is a bad idea. You're three damage away from winning. Okay. Whatever. I'll take the hit.
[1843.40s -> 1854.73s]  Doesn't matter. Okay. Now I'm going to take a, I think I just won. I won. Use the pillar? Pillars?
[1854.73s -> 1865.69s]  What do you mean? No, I, yeah, I win. That's it. How do I, do I have to, do I have to play something?
[1866.65s -> 1877.70s]  Okay. I win. Yeah. What's it about the pillars? Oh, pliers. Okay. You're going to survive maybe.
[1879.29s -> 1897.83s]  Knock on wood. That's how I do it. Raven, skunk, or sparrow. What does the skunk do again?
[1898.78s -> 1905.02s]  I, okay. Stinky, this creature opposing a card bearing this sigil loses one power.
[1905.74s -> 1910.62s]  Card bearing this sigil will strike an opponent directly even if there is a creature opposing it.
[1910.62s -> 1923.42s]  But this just, it just flies over and hits. This thing smells. I feel like this thing is amazing.
[1923.42s -> 1929.45s]  Stinky is good too. I don't want to end up, I feel like I have too many cards that are too
[1929.45s -> 1941.59s]  sacrifice. Isn't this, aren't I like late checking too much? I think I need some smaller things.
[1941.59s -> 1953.78s]  A one, two fly is busted. Go, just go full damage. Um, I think I'm going to do stinky.
[1953.78s -> 1960.97s]  I kind of, I don't know. I need some smaller cards. All right. This is a sacrifice pit or a fire.
[1960.97s -> 1965.58s]  What do I, what should I do? Um, I have not, I don't know what this is yet, so I'm going to go
[1965.58s -> 1976.49s]  this way. I haven't seen this yet. You came across a small group of survivors. Faces shrunken from
[1976.49s -> 1983.18s]  starvation. They huddled around a campfire. They looked upon your group of preachers and beckoned.
[1983.18s -> 1988.66s]  I'm warm. One of your creatures by the fire. One said warm it by the fire. That will enhance
[1988.66s -> 1993.11s]  its power said another. They're going to cook it and eat it. You notice one of the survivors wiping
[1993.11s -> 1999.40s]  drool from them. Yeah, this is horseshit. I'm not putting anybody here. How do I leave? How do I do
[1999.40s -> 2004.63s]  a spinning roundhouse kick to this guy's head and kick it like 500 yards that way. They're going to
[2004.63s -> 2019.46s]  eat it. I don't want them to do that. Hmm. They're going to eat this. Maybe the river snapper. I feel
[2019.46s -> 2026.92s]  like this is one six. That's a lot of health though. One of the wolves. I feel like this is,
[2026.92s -> 2038.89s]  this is all right, but do the stoat. I don't want to kill the stoat. Maybe the skunk. Is this,
[2038.89s -> 2044.30s]  okay. I feel like this is going to kill whatever this is in here. Is this going to kill this or
[2044.30s -> 2053.80s]  does it make it stronger? The fire warmed the poor skunk enhancing its power. One of the survivors
[2053.80s -> 2060.07s]  reached toward it. Another gnashed their teeth. Without a word, you roundhouse kick the leader
[2060.07s -> 2067.69s]  in the head. Okay, I get it. That's actually pretty good though because now that will do damage and
[2067.69s -> 2078.07s]  it takes power away. Okay, this is pretty cool. There's a way out for both of us. It's somewhere
[2078.07s -> 2089.96s]  in this foul cabin. Be silent or I will tear you to shreds. Mighty leap. A card bearing this
[2089.96s -> 2095.53s]  integer will block an opposing creature bearing the airborne. Okay, so they can't fly over this.
[2095.53s -> 2109.94s]  And here they are. Grizzly bear. That's not good. Four six. Oh shit. Um, four six. How am I supposed
[2109.94s -> 2142.57s]  to hit to handle this? I think I have to avoid it. Just go, just go for kill. Ow. Uh, what does
[2142.57s -> 2152.90s]  this do? Oh fuck. Oops. Okay. Um, what the fuck? How am I supposed to handle this? What do the
[2152.90s -> 2167.66s]  pliers do again? Not now. Draw a card first though. Um, this thing, it's going to kill everything.
[2167.66s -> 2174.87s]  Okay, now what does this do? You will place a weight on the scales. The path. Oh, I just put a
[2174.87s -> 2185.34s]  weight on it. All right, so the squirrel is going to die. That's fine. I think, right? So this squirrel
[2185.34s -> 2215.22s]  gets hit. I think I'm dead here. Uh, use the pliers now. A well-earned point of damage. I didn't think
[2215.22s -> 2226.58s]  you would really do it. What the fuck? Okay, can I kill him now? No, I just lose. I don't, I think
[2226.58s -> 2239.64s]  I just die here. Maybe not. I think I just have to put a squirrel down and just let it die. I can't
[2239.64s -> 2255.24s]  take this many hits. What am I supposed to do? Like, what am I supposed to do about this? Just
[2255.24s -> 2265.51s]  don't get hit. I mean, I'm just going to, this spot, you sure? I don't know. I can't, I can't even do
[2265.51s -> 2275.83s]  anything. What the fuck am I supposed to do about this? That was like five grizzlies. You lost.
[2275.83s -> 2282.86s]  Using this as a learning opportunity may be the only way to mitigate my disappointment. Get up.
[2282.86s -> 2296.87s]  Get up from the table. Catch me the candlestick from atop the barrel beside the door. What the
[2296.87s -> 2328.26s]  fuck? Bring it here. Ugh. Can I just leave? Honestly, is this the scenario right here? Uh,
[2328.26s -> 2336.42s]  yeah. I'm going. I'm sprinting forward and just wild swinging and like screaming and my hands coming
[2336.42s -> 2338.98s]  out like this and I don't even know what's, I'm just going to be, I'm just going to be stabbing
[2338.98s -> 2345.22s]  and swinging, biting and screaming and just stabbing. Right? Like I, that's how I'm getting out.
[2345.22s -> 2368.60s]  Sit back down. Let me explain something to you. That was one of the two mistakes you can make
[2368.60s -> 2386.23s]  here. If you make another, I must sacrifice you. Now, where were we? What? Read the clock.
[2386.87s -> 2394.81s]  Okay. I should probably go right because this will give me, you have two lives. I get it. Okay.
[2394.81s -> 2418.49s]  I'm going to go this way. Oh, huh. Ooh. What's this? What do these mean? I mean, I'm taking
[2418.49s -> 2424.02s]  the grizzly. Why the hell would I not? But what do these two mean? That's your little, uh, dollops
[2424.02s -> 2430.66s]  means you already have them. I'm taking, of course I'm taking the grizzly. What are you out of your
[2430.66s -> 2435.86s]  mind? And I'm going to, I'm going to put the grizzly up here so the grizzly does even more
[2435.86s -> 2445.42s]  damage. Really is going to be unfucking beatable. There is room for a creature around the fire.
[2445.42s -> 2451.98s]  There is the warmth will enhance its health. One of the survivors said nothing at all, but could
[2451.98s -> 2464.65s]  not stop licking their lips. It's health. Maybe it's the turtle. No way. I just have a four,
[2464.65s -> 2484.82s]  eight grizzly. That would be kind of insane, right? Or a one, five skunk. Wolf would be good.
[2484.82s -> 2493.53s]  Maybe the cat too. Three, two. Oh yeah. Like a three, three, four sounds really good. Really
[2493.53s -> 2501.11s]  strong. You're never going to be able to play the bear or what does this turn into? Oops.
[2504.70s -> 2517.80s]  I take it out more powerful. Does it just gain one, one? That'd be a two, five. So then,
[2517.80s -> 2522.28s]  so this would be all right. Yeah, that's it gets two, five. All right. That's, that's probably this
[2522.28s -> 2530.26s]  then. I think I'm going for that. Although I, that I'm that's only, then you only need to sacrifice
[2530.26s -> 2541.86s]  one thing for this. He said, pick something else. Do I have to listen to him? This is probably,
[2541.86s -> 2547.86s]  this is the safest one. I think that just make, gives it like a nice strong card. I think I'm
[2547.86s -> 2560.44s]  going for it. That's just like a solid three, four. I think that makes sense. All right. This
[2560.44s -> 2563.56s]  looks like a boss, like a real boss. Is this going to be like a tutorial boss where it kills
[2563.56s -> 2569.26s]  me and sends me to the back to the beginning or something? Don't read chat. All right. All right.
[2569.26s -> 2576.66s]  I won't read chat anymore. The trees seem to close in around you as a chill mist descended.
[2576.66s -> 2585.94s]  In the distance you could hear the clinking of metal on stone. All right. Lay out your arms then.
[2585.94s -> 2606.17s]  I'm back already. Took you for dead. It was the prospector. At the end of the owner's turn,
[2606.17s -> 2610.73s]  a card bearing the sigil will have moved in the direction inscribed in the sigil. So it goes like
[2610.73s -> 2632.58s]  this way, like that. Okay. So I want to put squirrel and then cat girl and get that cat down
[2633.30s -> 2649.74s]  and then put the skunk down. Oops. All right. Is it all right? I think I did this wrong.
[2653.02s -> 2658.79s]  Uh, I did this wrong. This is bad. Okay. I'm going to act on this might be stupid, but I'm going to
[2658.79s -> 2669.75s]  do this. And then we don't do this yet. Did I do it? So it's only a three, two. What? All right.
[2669.75s -> 2687.85s]  I'm done. Okay. Who cares? It comes right back. Where is it? Doesn't it come back? It doesn't come
[2687.85s -> 2704.38s]  back. Why? Um, this up so bad. Didn't I? All right. I can save it. I think what's over here.
[2705.18s -> 2709.98s]  I can save it. I can save it. I can save it. I fucked up. I fucked up. It's okay. I fucked up.
[2711.05s -> 2736.28s]  I fucked up. I fucked up. There we go. All right. Okay. I fucked up. Now I do squirrel and
[2737.00s -> 2746.26s]  sacrifice him. This will go forward. Okay. I can take a few hits. I think I'm okay.
[2747.06s -> 2754.63s]  This is salvageable. I fucked up. Did I put squirrel over here on the left? Probably.
[2755.75s -> 2763.59s]  I can take a couple of hits. I'm going to put the squirrel on the left.
[2764.63s -> 2771.03s]  I'm looking at chat. I do. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a streamer. My eyes are glued over here. I like,
[2771.03s -> 2777.19s]  I, I'm a live streamer. I go, I go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2778.25s -> 2781.37s]  Like, that's what we do. All right. I'm not looking over here anymore.
[2781.37s -> 2798.90s]  I'm almost at the fucking end of the game. I win. I win right now. I won. I won. Game over. I win.
[2800.25s -> 2820.49s]  Bring it. I hope you didn't think it'd be that easy. Gold. I've struck gold. Oh, this is bad.
[2820.49s -> 2837.22s]  What does this do? Old nugget. Why doesn't have a description? Um, I want to read what this does.
[2841.43s -> 2846.92s]  You're dead. Well, I can't do what I can't. I can't. I just have to kill that. I,
[2848.14s -> 2859.26s]  I have to block damage somehow. What the fuck? What's horseshit? What? What happened? How did
[2859.26s -> 2880.02s]  I lose so badly? He's doing the prospector again. Easy boss. The mule's key. What's that? Um,
[2880.02s -> 2916.17s]  I just lost. What happens now? More gold for me. You aren't dead yet. This isn't purgatory.
[2917.00s -> 2922.22s]  Though you may think of it that way. Before you expire, I must ask you a favor.
[2923.34s -> 2933.50s]  I would like a memento. Your very own death card. It's quite plain at the moment, isn't it?
[2933.50s -> 2938.62s]  We will work together to amend that. I want this to be the perfect memento of you.
[2941.61s -> 2949.11s]  Here are some cards from your mediocre deck. We can put them to good use. Please choose a card
[2949.11s -> 2958.25s]  to draw the cost from. They both cost two. Doesn't matter. Cost of two blood from the
[2958.25s -> 2966.46s]  river is separate. They're both, they're both two. Add another. This time I will use its power and
[2966.46s -> 2979.83s]  health. The numbers. Or six, right? I mean, like that's a bear. Is this a bad thing? Or six. Or
[2979.83s -> 2986.10s]  power and six health from the grizzly. Now choose a card from which we will extract the sigils.
[2987.61s -> 2994.84s]  Oh, and it can live forever. Is this what I get? Or does it stink? This can live forever?
[2997.82s -> 3004.71s]  Or the, or the stink. I think the stink might be great. You can sacrifice it forever.
[3004.71s -> 3011.86s]  It's definitely the cat, without a doubt. So now what? I never did ask you your name.
[3011.86s -> 3050.57s]  Oh, this is my card? There is now but one final matter. The portrait. Here we go again. Another
[3050.57s -> 3060.39s]  challenger. Perhaps it is time. Perhaps you can understand bones. The resourceful opossum costs
[3060.39s -> 3067.94s]  two bones. You gain a bone when one of your creatures perishes for any reason. Yo, I think
[3067.94s -> 3085.08s]  I just fucking won the game. This is cool. This is cool. This is cool. All right, so there's a
[3085.08s -> 3093.34s]  rattler there. It's one health. So we're gonna go like this and go. We're gonna go and go here.
[3094.79s -> 3099.03s]  Drop that down. From the death of your creature you've gained a bone. You will not lose this
[3099.03s -> 3117.78s]  until it is spent or the battle ends. Okay, let's go. Oops. Oh, I fucked up. Sorry. Oh shit. All
[3117.78s -> 3124.78s]  right. I forgot that they had to move down. Okay. Oops. All right. So wait, I can do the possum now,
[3124.78s -> 3136.12s]  right? Oh, I can do the possum. One, one. Go ahead and get a squirrel down just for shits.
[3136.76s -> 3157.88s]  There we go. Okay. Pull it back. Oh, he's gonna die anyways. Oops. It's all right. Remember, take
[3157.88s -> 3171.59s]  your pants off. Oh, forgot your figurine. Get up and fetch it for me. It's beside the safe.
[3176.34s -> 3219.30s]  All right. Hold on a minute here. Bullfrog. What does this mean? Can I like open the safe?
[3219.30s -> 3227.10s]  Times it? Six, three, 12? What time is it? Oh, you just got your safe opened, dumbass. 12,
[3227.10s -> 3252.34s]  three, six. I was on a 12. Never mind. Let us continue. Oh, coyote. This is a game. This
[3252.34s -> 3263.58s]  game is fun. This is a good game. This game is fun. Rattler, the unkillable cockroach returns to your
[3263.58s -> 3281.18s]  hand after dying. Oh, the unkillable. I'm taking the cockroach. You know, you're free to get up
[3281.18s -> 3288.94s]  again. Keep your blood flowing. I have no tyrant. You may stand whenever the map is unrolled. It
[3288.94s -> 3296.02s]  allows me time to plan your next encounter. Do keep your hands off my possessions. All right.
[3296.90s -> 3300.50s]  All right. What do you got here? What's going on here? How do I open? Okay. I got to open the
[3300.50s -> 3317.26s]  safe. I need a key. All right. What else do I got? I got to open the safe. This means something.
[3317.26s -> 3323.45s]  This means something. This is something to do with the time or the time of day it is. What time is
[3323.45s -> 3329.88s]  the clock? It is 12, three, six. Okay. I can move these. Let's go ahead and think about this for a
[3329.88s -> 3341.02s]  second here. I need three numbers, obviously. That hand doesn't never changes by the way.
[3341.02s -> 3348.76s]  This never changes off of midnight. Okay. So this never changes. So what we're going to do is we're
[3348.76s -> 3356.54s]  going to put the whole thing. We're going to put the whole thing at midnight and then it'll go.
[3360.34s -> 3371.35s]  Oh, nevermind. All right. So I need, I need three numbers, obviously. I don't know where I'm going
[3371.35s -> 3378.26s]  to get them. I'd probably get them over the course of the game. All right. Well, let's sit down.
[3378.26s -> 3384.94s]  Whatever. I'll figure it out. What's this? Mighty leap. Oh, there's 207. Okay. Thank you. 273. You
[3384.94s -> 3418.52s]  got it. That's a 273 right there. Excuse me. Open. Clock. 273. Open. Wait, there's another
[3418.52s -> 3433.38s]  thing. There's this. 273. I got it. Stink bug. Oh, hello. I wasn't sure if I would ever escape
[3433.38s -> 3442.62s]  that iron crypt. Is, is the stoat around? The stunted wolf? This madness must end. Put that away.
[3442.62s -> 3450.68s]  We're always got the key. This is where I turn around and I go, look at what I got.
[3453.18s -> 3470.31s]  Hmm. Maybe I should put it in here. Wow. Okay. What the fuck is this? Two, zero, five, um, one,
[3470.31s -> 3493.70s]  three, two, one. Okay. Zero to five, zero to five. Okay. This is like, this kills this. So I need to,
[3493.70s -> 3501.06s]  can I move these around? I don't think you guys understand. I, I, I play these kinds of games on
[3501.06s -> 3506.86s]  iPad almost every single day. I mean, I, I, I play games like this. I've, I've beaten every single
[3507.58s -> 3515.03s]  the franchise, the room. I played every single one of those three times. I was made to play this.
[3515.03s -> 3526.18s]  Okay. So this is going to do two to one. I wonder if I can flip these. Two, one, one, three. It is
[3526.18s -> 3530.74s]  one of the five, one of the five. Is it right? Good. Five is correct. So now I got to go like this.
[3531.98s -> 3541.53s]  So this is how much I'm trying to do damage, trying to kill somebody here. Right? Two out of five.
[3541.53s -> 3549.00s]  What am I looking for here? This is, what am I looking for? One here. Okay. So it's got to be
[3549.00s -> 3557.00s]  like this up a little bit more like that and up here. I'm not even sure what's going on here.
[3557.56s -> 3570.54s]  Okay. Three out of five. So what's happening here? Let's take a minute here. What's happening here?
[3570.54s -> 3576.58s]  Sigma relax. So this is doing one damage to, to this character. This is doing two damage to
[3576.58s -> 3583.29s]  this character. This is doing three damage to this character. It needs to be completely perfectly
[3583.29s -> 3606.36s]  balanced. That's technically right. I'm not looking. Three out of five. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[3607.98s -> 3614.06s]  Oh, that was, that was easier than I thought it was going to be. I got a stink. I forgot that I had
[3614.06s -> 3617.90s]  put that there very well. You may add it to your deck and I'll deal you one every so often. What
[3617.90s -> 3623.37s]  does this do? All right. Close this thing. Give me the next one. All right. So I get it. I understand.
[3623.37s -> 3634.68s]  I get it. This is a, this is locked out here. This can't be moved, but this can cause this is flight.
[3634.68s -> 3642.50s]  Got two out of five there. Let's go ahead and make this happen. Let me say three to five,
[3642.50s -> 3648.01s]  get that one back. We can please. Thank you. This one cannot be moved with five. You got it.
[3648.01s -> 3654.63s]  Put this back up here if we could please. Put this up. Here's your two out of five. Get that
[3654.63s -> 3661.27s]  up here please. Here's your two out of five. Get that up here if we could please. One out of five.
[3661.27s -> 3666.68s]  Let's put that back down please. I can't move them back and forth. Here's your two out of five. Put
[3666.68s -> 3712.10s]  that over here please. Close. Hold on. Three to five. Okay. I can't move this one. I gotta think.
[3712.10s -> 3729.10s]  I'm not looking. No, these are both fly. This is, this is the only thing doing the damage right
[3729.10s -> 3739.67s]  here. Isn't it? Wouldn't this do it? Here we go. I got it. I play these games in bed all day. Don't
[3739.67s -> 3744.15s]  worry. I get it. Wonderful creatures. Those ants very well. I will add them to your deck and make
[3744.15s -> 3752.78s]  them available for future challenges. Nice. Oh yeah. Let's go. I'll take all the cards please.
[3752.78s -> 3758.18s]  Let's make the game easy. I don't know what the bug does. I need to play a little bit more to
[3758.18s -> 3770.10s]  figure out what the bug does. What about this? Can't move this. Always check every single crevice.
[3770.10s -> 3779.34s]  Can't do that yet. Whatever it is. All right. What do we got here? I don't think I can do this yet.
[3779.34s -> 3791.82s]  I'm gonna play a little bit. Let's do a round. Now that I get some new cards, let's go. There's
[3791.82s -> 3798.09s]  some bone tokens for a rainy night. Four. If you deem it necessary, you may cut up one of my cards
[3798.09s -> 3804.09s]  with these. A rock might get you out of a hard place. That's kind of just a block. I have to
[3804.09s -> 3818.12s]  choose one. I don't know. I'm gonna say boulder. Just block damage. Or the scissors would be good
[3818.12s -> 3830.58s]  too. Bones are good too. Feeling overburdened enough with the full three items you carried on.
[3830.66s -> 3844.15s]  You again. Indeed. Our friend freed me. Well, I basically told him how to do it.
[3845.19s -> 3851.88s]  You got a plan? We have another friend here. You've gotta be. I wouldn't call him a friend.
[3852.76s -> 3864.98s]  But I suppose we are in deep this time. Pretty good boys. This guy has three shirts. What's going
[3864.98s -> 3880.01s]  on with my hair? Look at my hair. Bullfrog. What do we got? You are lacking squirrels.
[3880.09s -> 3885.37s]  Mighty leap. Card bearing the sigil will block. An opposing creature bearing the airborne sigil.
[3885.37s -> 3896.95s]  Alright, so I can put this in front of a bird. Let's put a squirrel down. Right here sounds good
[3896.95s -> 3908.73s]  I think. Yeah, just put it down now. Wait, oh, it takes bone, right? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright,
[3908.73s -> 3922.46s]  let's go. Alright, so now I want... What is the stink bug is... Alright, yeah. So we're gonna put
[3922.46s -> 3939.26s]  stink bug down. Let's kill a squirrel. Get this out. Oh, shit! I fucked it up. It's alright.
[3939.26s -> 3953.03s]  God damn it. I gotta remember more about that. It's okay. Okay. Back in the game. Alright,
[3953.03s -> 3964.84s]  let's go. I screwed... I wanted to put a... Yeah, I screwed up. It's fine. Give me a squirrel and
[3964.84s -> 3972.22s]  you'll kill that. Sounds good. We're good. Yeah, that's fine. Wolf, I don't need to do anything.
[3972.22s -> 3979.40s]  This game's over anyways. A brutal of you. You dealt me more damage than you needed to win.
[3979.40s -> 3985.30s]  However, in my game, such feats are rewarded. Be precise. A tooth to keep for each extra damage
[3985.30s -> 4000.34s]  dealt. The trapper may be interested in your spoils, but I get extra teeth? Pretty cool.
[4000.34s -> 4010.57s]  Elk fawn. An ascent fawn. It quickly grows into an elk and moves to the right. And what do you do?
[4011.21s -> 4017.62s]  That scared the shit out of me. I forgot about that. And I was like, the game is reading my
[4018.26s -> 4026.97s]  hard drive or something. I actually freaked out. Um, okay. Well, I mean, obviously I'm taking this.
[4026.97s -> 4034.28s]  What is that? Six bones. I mean, why wouldn't I not take this? It's literally like the best thing
[4034.28s -> 4045.02s]  that I have. And I'm going to make it more powerful in the... Why would you... Okay, I have a question.
[4045.02s -> 4052.30s]  Don't spoil the game for me. I have a question. This is just for free. This you have to sacrifice
[4052.30s -> 4061.18s]  someone. What's the kind of difference here? Do you get more? They do two different things.
[4061.18s -> 4071.67s]  You can get multiple abilities. It gives you... It gives card effects. Uh, you like essentially
[4071.67s -> 4085.11s]  absorb the card. I wonder if I should do this one. I'm doing this. The choice is yours.
[4085.11s -> 4090.46s]  Ant Queen. What is that? When a card bearing the sigil is played, an ant is created in your hand.
[4090.46s -> 4100.25s]  That seems kind of good. Cockroach. When a card bearing a copy of his... I mean, why would... I'm
[4100.25s -> 4106.60s]  going to do that with a thermo. That seems broken. That's absolutely broken. I'm guaranteed to beat
[4106.60s -> 4109.96s]  the game right now. I'm going to beat the game right now. I'm going to walk through the rest
[4109.96s -> 4125.66s]  of the game. Marvelous. I'll go. No, a thermo is gone. I mean, that's simple. That's very simple.
[4125.66s -> 4134.22s]  I now am going to get two of these and I'm going to walk through the game. This is really cool.
[4134.22s -> 4139.34s]  I like this. This is a fun game. Now I know why everyone said to play it. So strange. Why can't
[4139.34s -> 4149.66s]  I remember his name? I believe I lost some of my memory in the flash. Oh, these are people that
[4149.66s -> 4154.47s]  played the game before he made cards for them. He took their pictures and now they like cards
[4154.47s -> 4170.97s]  forever. That's what's going to happen to me. What do you got on the board? Okay. So this thing
[4170.97s -> 4178.22s]  hurts. I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like slow game playing Andy, by the way, because like,
[4178.22s -> 4194.23s]  I need to like pay attention. The value represented with this sigil will be equal to the number of
[4194.23s -> 4206.17s]  ants that the owner has on their side of the table. All right. What do you got? That's not going to
[4206.17s -> 4241.74s]  help. Okay. I need to get this into memory. It's hard to call it cowardly. I don't, I don't understand
[4241.74s -> 4268.06s]  the ant thing. I can't play this. Why not? I have to draw for us. Okay. Uh, uh, I would play.
[4268.06s -> 4279.11s]  Thanks. What damage is this thing doing? This thing doesn't have damage. Wait, what does the
[4279.11s -> 4290.15s]  worker ant not do any damage? It's just one. Oh, oh, okay. Oh, so it's how many ants you currently
[4290.15s -> 4318.15s]  just have. I'm going to get rid of this guy. Get your hand, elbows back. I don't know if you're
[4318.15s -> 4322.15s]  putting shit on the board or not. We get a referee to blow fucking whistle. That's don't do that.
[4322.15s -> 4328.74s]  I think I'm doing this. I, this is probably stupid. This is probably dumb, but I mean,
[4328.74s -> 4344.14s]  this is dumb. What I'm doing is dumb. What I just did was dumb, but whatever. I just won the game.
[4344.14s -> 4364.52s]  Maybe it wasn't dumb at mantis. Ooh, it hits both left and right. The alpha urgent boldness,
[4364.52s -> 4370.36s]  the creatures that stand beside it. So it gives what plus flow plus one plus one. All right. So
[4370.36s -> 4375.64s]  it gives plus one damage to everybody next to it. I feel like I want the mantis. I want the mantis
[4377.86s -> 4385.40s]  and then I'm going to make the mantis stronger by sacrificing something that I would do.
[4385.40s -> 4408.89s]  Then maybe that's what I would do. That's what I'm doing right now. I think it's going to be you
[4408.89s -> 4413.61s]  sacrifice. Wait, I could do, whoa, wait, I could do the reverse. Hold on. I could do the,
[4413.61s -> 4419.26s]  how do I back up? I could do the reverse. So if I sacrifice the mantis, I can give it to somebody
[4419.26s -> 4438.98s]  else. Oh shit. Uh, the wolf probably, the wolf would be crazy or the ant queen. Yeah, it's
[4438.98s -> 4464.20s]  definitely the wolf. This is, that's huge. What is that? What's that thing? Greetings. All right.
[4464.76s -> 4493.59s]  This is pretty basic here. I'm going to go, uh, squirrel bullfrog here and then, uh, yeah,
[4493.59s -> 4501.69s]  this won't kill it. I can sacrifice him afterwards. He'll actually, he'll fly over. I wonder if it's
[4501.69s -> 4507.58s]  worth it. Sacrificing. All right. We got stink bug, which what do you got? That'd be a one, one.
[4518.57s -> 4538.82s]  He's going to die anyways, so I need to get rid of him. What do you got to stink bug? Hold on.
[4538.82s -> 4553.30s]  My brain having trouble here. It's like, I could, I just got to pick a play. Okay. I'll kill. Um,
[4557.91s -> 4564.46s]  you go here. You'll kill this and then you're going to go here. This will die, but it's okay.
[4564.46s -> 4575.03s]  Cause I got this guy coming to here and let's go. It's fine. Okay. Whoa. I'm actually about to lose.
[4582.38s -> 4589.93s]  Look, there's a third talking card somewhere around here. Personally, I hate the guy biggest
[4589.93s -> 4597.46s]  kill joy ever, but he's the only one of us with a plan to get things back to normal.
[4597.46s -> 4646.07s]  Okay. That was a misplay. What are you in my chat right now? Relax. Okay. All right. All right.
[4646.07s -> 4673.30s]  All right. Ooh, good draw. Awesome. Good draw. I see the way this is going. I concede. You may
[4673.30s -> 4687.85s]  accept my surrender or you may finish this match the slow way. Why would I do that? Because if I
[4687.85s -> 4704.22s]  don't get extra tokens, if I do a bunch of damage, um, is this a dumb thing that I'm doing? All right.
[4704.22s -> 4716.94s]  Well, hold on. If I sacrifice stote and the opossum, I'll have two and two, right? That's
[4716.94s -> 4720.22s]  okay. That should, then that should do it. And that'll overkill. I think. Yeah.
[4724.70s -> 4746.14s]  Our numbers, the ants creed and put this out. I get extra. Um, all right. This is going to be
[4746.14s -> 4785.61s]  a huge overkill. Ooh, I love that pot. What's your opinion on the tectonic plates? What do you,
[4785.61s -> 4794.55s]  what do you want me to say? A thing that's, uh, it's a thing that's under the ground and
[4794.55s -> 4799.91s]  it makes the world shake. You were stopped along the way by a trapper looking to liquidate his
[4799.91s -> 4807.88s]  pelts. There was something uncanny about his appearance, but you were quickly distracted by
[4807.88s -> 4830.02s]  his wares. Here to look at my pelts, take a pelt free of charge. Um, rabbit. What do these do?
[4831.38s -> 4845.62s]  See the quality. Oh, it's the extra tokens. What do they do? I can have one for free. I don't get
[4845.62s -> 4860.22s]  it. Do I have to do this? Take the gold ones. Well, I mean, that's, I was going to take the
[4860.22s -> 4875.32s]  gold one, but I don't know. I'm going to take the gold one. That's what I would do. Golden pelt.
[4875.40s -> 4890.84s]  And I'll take a rabbit. You're leaving already? Please consider me pelts. Didn't I already take
[4890.84s -> 4904.38s]  them? You'll need, how do I leave? I'm done. I, thanks for your business. The man assured you
[4904.38s -> 4912.06s]  of the value of the pelts. They appear to be useless in a fight. Stop doubting yourself.
[4912.06s -> 4916.55s]  That's all I do. He mentioned that the trader further down the path would reward you for them.
[4916.55s -> 4948.28s]  I don't know what to do. I could sacri, I don't, I don't want to run like I'm getting rid of all
[4948.28s -> 4957.08s]  my cards though. No, I, I, I sacrifice like three cards already. I think warm light of a campfire.
[4957.08s -> 4965.18s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Through the 10 hungry guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Enhance its power. All right.
[4965.18s -> 4983.94s]  Stop this. It's going to be Wolf, man. You kidding me? It would be me too. I think I'm doing Wolf.
[4983.94s -> 4991.40s]  I haven't, I haven't seen this card come up once. Balance your damage across the cards.
[4991.40s -> 5000.49s]  Yeah. I kind of am just being like a two card Andy. Yeah. Aren't I? I like this one,
[5000.49s -> 5008.63s]  but I also like the opossum. I think I'm going to opossum. Opossum. That's what I'm doing.
[5008.63s -> 5019.98s]  That's what I'm doing. They had enhanced the creature's power, butting a few of the
[5019.98s -> 5026.52s]  survivors to ruling. You made a, Hey, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck? What? No,
[5026.52s -> 5040.23s]  I wanted, I, that's two bones and it gives me two damage. What? My boss battles are high stakes.
[5040.23s -> 5045.75s]  Test of your aptitude. With one flame, you'll either overcome them or die or not. I will let
[5045.75s -> 5059.72s]  you keep the smoke. Oh, it's this dude again. The incessant clank, clank, clanking. It's the
[5059.72s -> 5079.22s]  prospector, the prospector. Yeehaw. All right, let's go again. What does this do? What does that do?
[5079.22s -> 5087.85s]  Again, the smoke. When a card bearing the sigil dies, four bones are awarded instead of one. Oh
[5087.85s -> 5096.23s]  shit. Can I just get that out there now? Let's get that out there right now. Kill the mule first,
[5096.23s -> 5108.36s]  right? That's a card set. All right. This is what I'm going for. I'm going for, get rid of this,
[5108.36s -> 5121.40s]  put this here. I don't know what the pelt does. Squirrel. But don't be stupid about this. I fucked
[5121.40s -> 5132.68s]  it up already. This thing goes right. Shit. Can I sacrifice that? I can. All right. So just sacrifice
[5132.68s -> 5139.91s]  it. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. So I can just sacrifice this and put down
[5139.91s -> 5150.76s]  the, what does the most damage? One, three. I'll put you down. Good. You go here and then
[5152.66s -> 5163.37s]  you go here and then you go here. And then what is the, I don't know what this does. I'm afraid to
[5163.37s -> 5180.01s]  use it. That's fine. Rabbit pelt. What the fuck? All right. I have to, I don't want to use these.
[5180.57s -> 5190.84s]  What do these do? Why is it going this way? This will get killed. That's fine. I'll be all right.
[5193.35s -> 5199.62s]  They're blockers. All right. I'm just gonna put this one down. I'm putting this here.
[5200.58s -> 5221.34s]  I'm about to, I'm about to win. Perfect. This is two, one. Perfect. All right. Move over. That's
[5221.34s -> 5233.99s]  fine. Good. All right. This is super wolf. Super wolf is going to take out these two. Oh, fuck off.
[5234.95s -> 5287.06s]  Wait, what? Oh, it's all right. Wait. Okay. I, it goes like that. Oops. Okay. Okay. Do you have to
[5287.06s -> 5295.85s]  kill this stuff? Get them. Yeah. Please get rid of it. I don't, I can't do anything yet. Just go,
[5295.85s -> 5302.63s]  go again. Doesn't, I can't do anything yet. I'm putting Jerm around next turn. Here we go. Bingo.
[5302.63s -> 5313.50s]  Squirrel. Squirrel. Boing. Boing. Okay. Where's this going? This is, this is like just unbelievably
[5313.50s -> 5333.64s]  good. Go right here. Yeah. That's game over right now. Goodbye. What's that? Dag nabbit my mule.
[5336.71s -> 5352.73s]  Thank you. Okay. What do I got? Um, I think I can win pretty easily here. Hold on. Elk is,
[5354.42s -> 5360.39s]  alpha is okay. Wait, I can do alpha. I got to put it right here. I could do
[5363.70s -> 5375.54s]  and don't have any hands. Ant queen is okay. Here's the deal. Uh, Elk is kind of sick too,
[5375.54s -> 5381.45s]  though, isn't it? I think I'm going to do Elk. Oh no, wait, no, no. This gives ants.
[5382.01s -> 5396.30s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this do? Okay. We're good. All right. That's good.
[5396.30s -> 5417.40s]  I'll have to win again. All right. I just win the game. Bingo. There it is. All right. First boss
[5417.40s -> 5429.03s]  done. Allow me to light your candles once more. I won't be killing you quite yet. Very nice.
[5431.80s -> 5439.67s]  You're the first in a while to overcome a boss. As a reward, you are granted an opportunity to
[5439.67s -> 5460.84s]  select a rare card. Boost carefully. Strange larva. The level of brutish strength needs no
[5460.84s -> 5478.81s]  explanation. Seven? Seven and what? And Gek. The uninspiring Gek, perhaps you can find a use for it.
[5478.81s -> 5492.41s]  Um, this doesn't cost anything. I feel like these, these are, these are bait because this is free.
[5492.41s -> 5503.42s]  It does one damage and I can sacrifice it whenever I want. Um, what does this turn into? Probably
[5503.42s -> 5517.51s]  some kind of big bug or something, right? Taking the Gek. It's just a free card. Huge early game.
[5517.51s -> 5521.83s]  With sound of the prospector's pickaxe still ringing in your ears, you carried onwards.
[5526.76s -> 5536.63s]  The rank smell of rot and mold permeated the humid air. Every step forward was answered by
[5536.63s -> 5547.61s]  some nearby slip or slither, but cautiously into the wetlands. Good card. Barbara's nice, but Gek
[5547.61s -> 5559.00s]  is cool, dude. Yeah. River snapper, adder, barren. It spawns a rabbit when it is played.
[5565.35s -> 5575.64s]  Zero one rabbit. This is kind of an annoying card. Well, this is a zero two and it gives you a zero
[5575.64s -> 5585.30s]  one. Hmm. That's kind of, that's kind of annoying. I think it's, that's, that's, that's the adder.
[5585.30s -> 5588.74s]  I would take the adder just to in case you get run into a huge enemy or something. I don't know
[5588.74s -> 5597.24s]  what that is. What is this? I think this means I'm like deleting a card for some reason, right?
[5597.24s -> 5605.88s]  What does the pack do again? What's the backpack do? I clicked on this once. I forget what it was.
[5605.88s -> 5614.04s]  Items. I guess I want to see what this is, so I'm going to click it, right? I don't know what
[5614.04s -> 5626.90s]  this is. Some familiar stones, but there was something different. You intuited. The fate of
[5626.90s -> 5638.54s]  the creature selected for this would not be pleasant. I delete a card. Do what you must.
[5638.54s -> 5655.72s]  Nope. That was the worst card that I have. The rabbit. I have just like a shitty rabbit
[5655.72s -> 5668.12s]  belt. No elp. I would probably get, I don't know. Bullfrog kind of sucks, but it only
[5668.76s -> 5676.04s]  sacrifice though. I feel like I'm going to need these later. I'm doing bullfrog. I'm going to,
[5676.04s -> 5685.42s]  I don't know what this does. Slaughtered the bullfrog. However, the bone lord was pleased
[5685.42s -> 5694.50s]  by your sacrifice. A minor boon of the bone lord. You will start each battle with one extra bone.
[5694.50s -> 5717.35s]  That's kind of a big deal. Kind of at least, right? Worth it. Yeah. What does this mean?
[5717.35s -> 5759.13s]  All right. Let me go down here again. How many ants do I have? I got to move one person here.
[5759.13s -> 5797.54s]  Come on. I'm so close. There it is. Caged wolf. There's one, there's another one of these over
[5797.54s -> 5834.42s]  here. I don't want to hit that. I can't. Okay. So I have to hit this one. It's three. Got it.
[5834.42s -> 5839.91s]  What is that? Without having met her, this wood carving is meaningless. In time you will
[5839.91s -> 5849.37s]  understand its power. And there's a squirrel right here. Oh, it's just like hearthstone.
[5849.37s -> 5879.10s]  What does that mean? That doesn't work. Still didn't do the clock yet. Is there another thing?
[5879.10s -> 5907.66s]  Oh no, I didn't. No, I didn't. Is there something listed here? Ah, hammer. Staff. Oh, teeth. Okay.
[5907.66s -> 5928.65s]  I got some teeth. Is there anything else I can do? I got another card. Oh, I don't think I can do
[5928.65s -> 5951.78s]  anything about that. I got another card. What about the candles? Oh, you get a stump and you get a
[5951.78s -> 5970.15s]  frog. Okay. I'm doing ant queen. Uh, yeah. I'm going to wait until ant queen. All right. I don't
[5970.15s -> 5984.87s]  want this to get killed. So ant queen's going over here. Oh, perfect. All right. I'm going to
[5984.87s -> 6003.35s]  put this down here in just a moment. All right. I want a squirrel. All right. So let me see here.
[6003.35s -> 6028.09s]  Out here. Work our ant here. Perfect. Very perfect. Very perfect. Very good. Excess damage is not
[6028.09s -> 6032.57s]  wasted. It carries over to the card behind the mangled corpse of the victim. So that was cool.
[6032.57s -> 6041.82s]  I didn't even know that. Lucky for you. All right. What do we got on the board? Adder. Bullfrog. I
[6041.82s -> 6055.83s]  don't care about the bullfrog. Although I could put the Adder out here. Oh, I need two. Shit.
[6055.83s -> 6079.11s]  Probably should have read that. Oh, whatever. Uh, go here. Oh, I thought I won. I think I
[6079.11s -> 6112.25s]  win anyways. I think I win anyways. I keep fucking doing this. I keep fucking doing that.
[6112.25s -> 6148.20s]  I keep forgetting this is two. I should still be fine though. Okay. Now go like this. I'm so
[6148.20s -> 6162.98s]  close to winning. Just win already. I'm not going to lose. I'm not going to lose. I have to pee.
[6162.98s -> 6171.10s]  All right. I'm going to pee soon here. River otter. The elusive otter. It submerges itself
[6171.10s -> 6186.76s]  during my turn. A beehive will draw a bee when it gets attacked. Or Kaminsky. When an opposing
[6186.76s -> 6191.00s]  creature is placed opposite to an empty space, a card bearing the sigil will move to that empty
[6191.00s -> 6203.85s]  space. Let me read that again. When somebody on the other team is placed in an empty space,
[6206.57s -> 6218.42s]  opposite an empty space, this card will move to that space. And it's like a thorns. Okay. I get it.
[6218.42s -> 6228.70s]  That's a good card. Submerged itself during its opponent's turn. While submerged, opposing creatures
[6228.70s -> 6237.18s]  attack its owner. All right. So this is just like stealth. That's not bad either. This is cool too
[6237.18s -> 6243.56s]  though. I could buff this at a campfire. I think I'm going to do the beehive. Otter is unkillable.
[6243.56s -> 6253.56s]  Um, they all suck. I would probably, I'm going to, I'm going to do beehive. You need to go piss. I
[6253.56s -> 6262.09s]  will in a second. I'm busy. All right. Now I'm going to, I'm going to buff the beehive. This might be
[6262.09s -> 6269.86s]  health. It's health and that's big. Or I could sacrifice somebody. Maybe I'll sacrifice somebody.
[6269.86s -> 6285.61s]  I'm going to sacrifice someone. All right. What do I want? What do I want to sacrifice?
[6285.61s -> 6297.75s]  Oh man. Beehive. Beehive on somebody. Go piss. Why are you saying go piss girl? What? All right.
[6297.75s -> 6308.46s]  I think I'm doing beehive. Yep. I'm going to give that to the ant queen. No. Somebody that I can,
[6309.34s -> 6316.33s]  it has to be somebody that can stay alive. What is it? Ooh, cage wolf. That's just six health.
[6316.33s -> 6327.18s]  What is it? Okay. This is kind of interesting. It'll just spawn a bunch of shit. It's got to
[6327.18s -> 6342.73s]  have to be something with at least a few health. Maybe the cat. Skink too, right? I'm going to say
[6342.73s -> 6349.74s]  probably this because that will just spawn bees over and over again. If it's a bad idea,
[6349.74s -> 6379.11s]  it's a bad idea. Whatever. It has a ton of health. Bullfrog, rabbit, pelt, squirrel. Okay. I'll put
[6379.11s -> 6396.60s]  the, just go here and I'm going to put the pelt down right here because why not? Oh, I, oops.
[6396.60s -> 6409.27s]  Ant queen. Can I even sacrifice two things? Shit, that was stupid. Yeah. That was just,
[6409.83s -> 6413.59s]  that was just bogus of me. I don't know why I did that, but it's all right. I can just go another
[6413.59s -> 6428.81s]  turn. I actually want you to clear this shit out. I don't want it. Oh, that was a, that was a big
[6428.81s -> 6453.50s]  problem. That was actually really bad. Uh, I think I have to do this. Oh my God. I'm fucking dead.
[6453.50s -> 6467.99s]  I'm going to die right now. I blew it so bad. This will be two. All right, hold on. I'll kill
[6467.99s -> 6475.14s]  this. Okay. If I get an ant out here, it'll be two, two, which it'll kill this. It'll kill the
[6475.14s -> 6495.29s]  thing behind it. I think I really blew it. I can put the pelt down here or something. Or should I
[6495.29s -> 6515.58s]  kill this row? What row is more dangerous? What row is more dangerous? Probably this one. Actually,
[6515.58s -> 6537.69s]  I don't know. They're both kind of the same. The spider is like, was that loud? And then I'll put
[6537.69s -> 6558.18s]  the pelt over here. Right? I hope that's right. You scared me. Like there's a bug in the room.
[6558.18s -> 6562.97s]  Well, I don't know. If you were watching, I clearly gave at least two or three seconds of like a, oh,
[6562.97s -> 6568.87s]  I'm about to yell because it's a spider. All right. I got to put something down here so that I don't
[6568.87s -> 6576.57s]  die. This is going to get killed, right? Or do I not care? Cause I'll get some way out. I'll be
[6576.73s -> 6609.05s]  I'll be fine. Okay. Now piece of shit. I don't think I need this yet because hold on. This'll
[6609.05s -> 6619.10s]  do two or will I beat it? Will I kill him if I take it too without? This is risky. I will. I
[6619.10s -> 6633.43s]  think this is going to kill him, right? And then that's four. That should be it. Just to be safe.
[6633.43s -> 6654.62s]  I'm going to think that's it. I think I did it. Rattler, Reginald, tragic rat king. When their
[6654.62s -> 6670.39s]  tangled bodies become corpses, you will gain four bones. I don't get it. What four bones instead of,
[6670.39s -> 6681.82s]  Oh, okay. So I just get, I feel like I'm, I need more bone cards though. I have tons of bones.
[6681.82s -> 6704.22s]  You know what to do. I can't spend the bones. This is huge too. Card bearing the sigil damages
[6704.22s -> 6718.89s]  another creature. The creature perishes. That's pretty huge. Monkey W. That's pretty big. Yeah.
[6718.89s -> 6733.29s]  I'll take it. Should I get an item? I'm going to get an item. Gustrum. This may lift your creatures
[6733.29s -> 6744.46s]  into the air if only for a turn of fliers. That means like they can't be targeted or something.
[6744.46s -> 6752.87s]  This seems kind of cool. The creatures will attack as though they have the airborne. Oh,
[6752.87s -> 6762.57s]  that's amazing. I want that. Bleeding yields three blood if you can ignore the
[6762.57s -> 6779.82s]  beating. Wait, what's happening? Oh, but what, but what though? Black Oat is created in your hand.
[6779.82s -> 6793.70s]  A black goat is defined as zero power, one health, worthy of sacrifice. It counts as three. It gives
[6793.70s -> 6819.67s]  three blood. Okay. There we go. There we go. So this is going to spawn bees, airborne and
[6819.67s -> 6828.30s]  submerges. So this thing is going to be paying the ass. Okay. So this thing's, this thing I'm
[6828.30s -> 6833.42s]  never going to get rid of. Uh, so I'm going to deal with these two. Oh, a scream because
[6833.42s -> 6856.62s]  it's a spider. How much health do you have? All right. Keep me alive. I'll try. And do you know
[6856.62s -> 6900.52s]  what? Let's put a, uh, none of these are going to, uh, please go pee. I'm not going to use the goat.
[6900.52s -> 6909.75s]  I'm still confused on what this means. It costs one blood, but I'm confused at what, what the
[6909.75s -> 6916.06s]  point is. When this thing dies, what happens? Goat is better than the wolf. Use it and find out.
[6916.06s -> 6942.18s]  It gives worth three for a sacrifice. I don't, I don't get it. Cost one gives three. Um, so I get
[6942.18s -> 6952.86s]  to play more. Okay. Whatever. I'm kind of confused. Um, holy shit, Jeremy. I hold on. I'm sacrificing
[6952.86s -> 6963.62s]  it is like sacrificing three cards. So is there like an indicator of how many I've sacrificed so
[6963.62s -> 6972.23s]  far? So I can play. So if I put this goat down, if I need three blood, I just eat that and it counts
[6972.23s -> 6979.08s]  as three blood. It's worth three. Okay. It's the cost. Yeah. All right. That's what I thought it
[6979.08s -> 6986.78s]  was. I could just put this down and put this down too. I actually don't really know what the hell
[6986.78s -> 7003.86s]  to do right now. I don't think I want to use that now though. Like that's like a boss thing. I'm
[7003.86s -> 7007.70s]  just going to do this and whatever happens happens here. Cause like I kind of been screwed here.
[7007.70s -> 7017.10s]  This is probably a bad idea, but it is such a bad idea. This is a really bad idea, but who cares?
[7017.10s -> 7021.02s]  I'm full of bad ideas. This is a terrible idea. This is literally the worst move I could possibly
[7021.02s -> 7055.16s]  do. I think it is lost. Um, I don't know what to do. Let the wolf die. Yeah. I'm just going to farm,
[7055.16s -> 7074.57s]  but I think I'm dead next turn. I'm just like dead next turn. I fucked up this whole round. Um,
[7074.57s -> 7088.63s]  I think it's lose cause this can't. All right. So this card can never die, right? This can literally
[7088.63s -> 7101.74s]  not be killed. No matter what I can cut this card and get rid of it. So I will live if I put,
[7101.74s -> 7110.89s]  but this goes over the bee. Is this bad to do? Let's just do it. Okay. So that's gone. This
[7110.89s -> 7114.73s]  can't attack it. This is going to do one damage regardless. This is going to hit the, all right.
[7114.73s -> 7128.47s]  So let's do this. Let's just put this down like here and cause, uh, Oh my God, my brain. I just
[7128.47s -> 7136.26s]  don't, I can't. Well, the, will this bit lock it? Cause I need to tip the scales. Otherwise I'm
[7136.26s -> 7144.90s]  going to lose. E brain. Well, I mean, if I don't, I can't, if I don't tip the scales, I'm going to
[7144.90s -> 7154.31s]  fucking lose. Right? What are you talking about? Cause if I could take one more damage, I think
[7154.71s -> 7165.98s]  I'm dead. I think that's what's happening here. Right? Like I kind of had to do that. Didn't I?
[7165.98s -> 7176.76s]  All right. Ron saved. I can sacrifice the squirrel and the bee, kill both these motherfuckers over
[7176.76s -> 7199.42s]  here. I don't want to screw this up though. Let me get this right. Cause this is how I hate this.
[7199.42s -> 7208.74s]  I have to kill. This is going to die next turn. Do I wait until next turn to play me and just put
[7208.74s -> 7222.49s]  the bee down because then I'll kill this. I'll put the bee down here and just, or let, I can't,
[7222.57s -> 7228.41s]  I sacrifice this and kill this row. What I, this is the one that's going to Kurt kill me though.
[7228.41s -> 7232.81s]  I don't know. I have no idea. I'm just going to fucking go for it. I have no idea. Like I
[7232.81s -> 7236.09s]  don't play these kinds of games. I don't play Hearthstone in bed every night. I do every night.
[7236.09s -> 7242.82s]  I have like 2000 hours in battlegrounds. All right. I'm going to put the bee down. No, I'm not.
[7242.82s -> 7269.38s]  Oh, I just need to stop talking and just focus. Oh my God. What do I do? I'm fine. What was that?
[7269.38s -> 7276.52s]  I didn't want to, I didn't want you to do that. What the fuck was that? I didn't want you to do
[7276.52s -> 7305.40s]  that. I kind of blew everything, didn't it? All right. I'm going to kill this row here. Please be
[7305.40s -> 7342.49s]  right. Please be right. I think this is right. Okay. Good. Okay. I'm good. Please. Let's get,
[7342.49s -> 7348.55s]  let's get, let's just fucking look. Pay attention. It's like here, like a voice over here and a thing
[7348.55s -> 7351.75s]  over here. No, you go that way. You go that way. And I'm just like, no, no, no. Everyone,
[7351.75s -> 7359.27s]  everybody stop talking and let's, let's go. Is it, I got 18,000 people in my head and they're all you.
[7359.27s -> 7384.39s]  All right. Kind of cool. For the beehive. I need bone consumption. I need bone. All right. I'm
[7384.39s -> 7405.93s]  almost at the boss. I can't, I don't have, I can't do items. Do I want to put in here? I mean,
[7405.93s -> 7426.81s]  that's, I could just get that on somebody or I could do this and then Ant Queen maybe. What about
[7426.81s -> 7439.80s]  the Gek? Holy shit. And I can play that for free. You suck at strats. I know. Oh, I know. Trust me.
[7439.80s -> 7447.24s]  All right. I got to pee. I'll be right back. Pee time. BRB. One second. Well, maybe like a minute
[7447.24s -> 7815.30s]  or two. I'll keep this music on too. It's interesting. What happened? Oh, I see. Got minimized.
[7819.86s -> 7837.62s]  Oops. Let's continue. Let's get this shit out of you. What? Sorry. Why is the, why was the music
[7837.62s -> 7849.69s]  not on? That's kind of weird. Oh, it's because I hit the windows key. That's right. Oops. All right.
[7849.69s -> 7861.16s]  So this is the boss. Let me get one chance. How smell invaded your nostrils and caused your throat
[7861.16s -> 7871.51s]  to seize. Hulking man sat by a brackish pond with his feet submerged in the dark water. He pulled a
[7871.51s -> 7886.65s]  hook from a pile of rotting fish and rose to his feet. I am the angler. Go fish. The angler,
[7886.65s -> 7893.22s]  mind his hook. Play a squirrel or something when he aims it. I will protect your best cards.
[7897.61s -> 7912.10s]  Okay. He's not going to be happy about this one. All right. Everybody quiet. Everybody's silent.
[7914.89s -> 7931.37s]  Okay. Here we go. This play thing. Go squirrel. No smoke. No. Squirrel. Squirrel going out.
[7931.37s -> 7942.33s]  But again, still stink bug. I'm going out too. Oh, he did it wrong. He did it wrong. He did it
[7942.33s -> 7966.41s]  wrong. He did it wrong. He did it wrong. Whatever. Which fish are choose. What's that mean? Um,
[7966.41s -> 7981.11s]  can I put something on top of this? I don't get it. I don't get it. World. He's, he's saying he's
[7981.11s -> 7997.00s]  going to take this card. Um, what do I do about this? Pressure fish. Easy. Choose. Oh, okay. I
[7997.00s -> 8008.41s]  get it. Oh shit. No, I thought, I didn't know he moved again. I didn't know he moved it again.
[8008.41s -> 8012.73s]  All right. I thought he just decided. Oh, okay. But what, what is he going to do about that?
[8012.73s -> 8018.86s]  Oh, I'm in trouble now. Oh, I'm now, I'm in a lot of trouble. Okay. I, I messed it up. Wait. No,
[8018.86s -> 8036.68s]  I didn't get it. Whatever. I didn't. Oh, okay. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[8036.68s -> 8060.23s]  I, I, I, that was good. That's not a bad move. Decent play. Really? All right. So if I do, uh,
[8060.23s -> 8073.26s]  Gecko's not good here though. Maybe it is because it'll kill that because if it kills that, he gets
[8073.26s -> 8080.01s]  the bones and then this won't attack me. And then I go like this and then I say, let's go.
[8080.81s -> 8110.98s]  We're good. Stale fish. Hard choice. Um, wait, cause he's going to take that. If I play a card,
[8110.98s -> 8121.34s]  he takes it. So I don't really care if he takes this because I could, he'll take the pelt. All
[8121.34s -> 8129.74s]  right. Let me see how dumb this is. If I go boom, boom, and then I put the pelt down. Okay. That's
[8129.74s -> 8151.96s]  what I'm doing. Okay. Let's go. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and take that one. I don't give a shit.
[8151.96s -> 8167.18s]  Oh, wait. Does it shuffle the board? It does. Okay. Go fish. Uh, he just gets a free turn.
[8167.90s -> 8171.50s]  I will use this opportunity to pull a, um, a scout and end my turn.
[8173.02s -> 8185.96s]  Oh my God. What did happen? What the hell is that? Um, okay. This is bad.
[8195.70s -> 8224.66s]  Uh, I need bones. That's bad. Not good. Four, five. I don't think that's enough. Is it enough?
[8225.62s -> 8237.02s]  I sacrifice a squirrel and do the fan. Is that enough? That's enough? Sacrifice. Huh?
[8237.58s -> 8251.38s]  Enough. Wait, hold on. Everyone relax. Sacrifice. Yeah. What happened? Wait, does this come back?
[8252.02s -> 8256.66s]  No, no, no, no. This doesn't, that doesn't work like that. What do you mean?
[8257.30s -> 8263.70s]  You use, hold on. Yes. I hope you guys aren't lying to me.
[8266.57s -> 8287.05s]  Did I do it? And do the fan now. And there's four or five. Is that enough? Just end your turn. But
[8287.05s -> 8303.27s]  are they going to hit shit? You win. You win. You win. You win. What? Oh my God. I thought. Okay.
[8303.27s -> 8307.62s]  The reason why I freaked out is because I thought he was going to hit this for some reason.
[8307.62s -> 8311.61s]  Relight your candles. Thank you. I thought he was going to hit that. Okay.
[8311.61s -> 8327.29s]  Didn't need to even use the fan. Okay. Another larva. This thing.
[8328.01s -> 8337.22s]  Wild 13. Doesn't die when sacrificed, but you have the heart to try.
[8341.26s -> 8359.53s]  So it just stays on the board forever. I feel like I can't already have a couple of these,
[8359.53s -> 8375.26s]  don't I? In a way. I'll take the larva. Why not? Dinner would have to wait. Let me see.
[8375.26s -> 8385.10s]  Bridget gust of wind billowed unwelcome into your lungs. Beauty of the falling snow failed to
[8385.10s -> 8393.62s]  distract you from the chill in your bones. You had to send it to the snow line. Plus you got in your
[8393.62s -> 8428.84s]  fucked up little room here. Um, finally pried my special dagger from the paws of that squirrel,
[8428.84s -> 8466.09s]  though you may wish that you hadn't. What can I do with that? I have an item now. Smoke.
[8466.09s -> 8479.18s]  You have the knife. Okay. Yeah. I use it on the, do I have to sit down? That one's only for card
[8479.18s -> 8494.23s]  dueling. You encountered a small outpost in the woods tended by a mysterious woman. It was the
[8494.23s -> 8502.52s]  trader that the old trapper had mentioned. Her appearance was unsettling, but you were mollified
[8502.52s -> 8512.42s]  by her offering. Do you mind if I examine those pelts of yours? Start with you hair pelts. Here's
[8512.42s -> 8531.00s]  what I can offer. I can trade you any of these. Take your time. You may search your deck or any
[8531.00s -> 8540.81s]  card and take it into your hand when you play this. That seems really good. Ringworm. This
[8540.81s -> 8547.50s]  thing kind of sucks. What does this thing do? This thing's terrible. I think I want the coyote
[8547.50s -> 8557.86s]  because I have things that generate bones. I have barely any bone spenders. This thing doesn't even
[8557.86s -> 8574.57s]  have a description. Bagpie. Yeah. Magpie is good too. I don't have any bone spenders. I have all
[8574.57s -> 8578.09s]  these things generating bones, but they just sit on the table. Okay. The last like three or four
[8578.09s -> 8589.21s]  games, I had like four or five, six bones just sitting there. I'm thinking about taking mantis
[8589.21s -> 8606.65s]  just so I can sacrifice it and give it to somebody else. Is that a golden pelt? Magnificent. Deus.
[8610.06s -> 8614.14s]  Chime is created on each empty adjacent space. The chime is defined as zero. So when you put
[8614.14s -> 8637.59s]  it down to zero one. Oh man. So this just kind of gets in the way or it's a random card. Two
[8637.59s -> 8666.86s]  seven. Oh, oh, this is just like a tank. I'll take the tank. Who the hell is this? Who's that?
[8666.86s -> 8686.81s]  Choice is yours. Who is this? It's me. Okay. So I'm going to give the spreading move. Will this kill
[8686.81s -> 8701.34s]  everything? This will kill two things, right? That's kind of a big deal. That's a huge deal.
[8701.34s -> 8725.67s]  That's three bones too. Perfect. I don't know what this is. We haven't seen it yet. FD.
[8725.67s -> 8741.51s]  Creatures in the way get pushed. That's kind of scary. So this is going to move forward.
[8741.51s -> 8746.23s]  So I should try. I got to get. How many bones do I have? I only have one bone. That'll be two.
[8747.18s -> 8759.45s]  If I put Reginald here and they come down, it'll kill them both. All right. I need to think about
[8759.45s -> 8770.30s]  this. Oh, let's just put something out there. I'll put the skink here. Right? Yeah. Right.
[8771.10s -> 8790.98s]  Is that stupid? I think that's it. Yeah. Then that's a bone and then it's two bones. I can't
[8791.30s -> 8793.06s]  do anything else really. So we're just gonna go.
[8795.46s -> 8808.09s]  So that's your three. Unfortunately, I will kill these two. Let's go ahead and get that out of the
[8808.09s -> 8814.06s]  way. Let me draw first. I'll draw a scroll. All right. Reginald's going here. That'll kill both
[8814.06s -> 8825.80s]  of these and I need to put something over here. No, I can just wait. What does the knife do?
[8825.80s -> 8834.57s]  You will place a weight on the scales. Pain is temporary. Okay. So that'd be like,
[8834.57s -> 8846.98s]  point point. I gotta draw something, right? That's kind of bad, isn't it?
[8860.57s -> 8870.87s]  It's me. Okay. Hi. You're really kind of screwing this up. Oh, I think it is when I just went.
[8871.51s -> 8883.38s]  It's not a bad play. I just win right now. Hey, what? Hey, what are you talking about? Oh,
[8883.38s -> 8905.51s]  it gets in the way of right. Okay. Whatever. I win right now because that'll be it's zero.
[8905.51s -> 8910.31s]  It's going to go, I'm just going to sacrifice these guys. No, I'm not. I'll win next turn. Who
[8910.31s -> 8956.02s]  cares? Yeah, I'll win this time. Yeah. Good for you. What is happening right now? I might,
[8956.02s -> 8961.67s]  I might be able to do this. If I go boom, boom and go this way, it might be a victory already,
[8961.67s -> 8986.54s]  right? I think that's a win. I do that. That's one, two, then I can do two, which would go
[8986.78s -> 9017.50s]  here. Hey, I think I just won. I didn't. No, I win the game. I win. I win. The game's over. I win.
[9018.14s -> 9032.14s]  I win. The game's over. The game's over. I win. It's fine. Whatever. What's this?
[9032.78s -> 9054.07s]  I have the most exquisite pelts. I got a lot of teeth. First one's free. Don't buy more. Yeah.
[9054.07s -> 9059.78s]  Isn't this going to just kind of load up my deck with a bunch of shit? Maybe just buy this one.
[9059.78s -> 9069.53s]  I feel like this is going to load my deck up with a bunch of crap. I'm going to buy the gold one and
[9069.53s -> 9103.64s]  that's it. All right. What am I sacrificing? Mole man or larva? Mole has two effects. Yeah,
[9103.64s -> 9113.98s]  I don't know. I feel like this would be cool though. Mole man can make somebody crazy.
[9113.98s -> 9131.37s]  That one's good too. Yeah. This one's good because then I can put it on. Oh, it would not,
[9131.37s -> 9135.77s]  it would not hit whoever it was and they would move out of the way. And okay, I wonder maybe the,
[9135.77s -> 9144.70s]  maybe the mole man or larva. Yeah, that's a good one because then this will absolutely live one
[9144.70s -> 9158.33s]  turn and then transform. I'm starting to get it a little more. Although games like this really kind
[9158.33s -> 9171.64s]  of nerve wracking for me. All right. You got a mole man, but this pushes in direction. This one
[9171.64s -> 9185.66s]  will always be a tank. So I keep, I, that was the scream at the bug joke. I wonder if I even do
[9185.66s -> 9194.84s]  anything or just skip. I think I'm just going to skip or something. Yeah. Cause if I put this down,
[9194.84s -> 9211.08s]  I feel like he's just going to die like immediately. And I guess I'm just going to do this ever.
[9211.08s -> 9230.97s]  Ow. That hurts a lot. Again with this shit draw. Oh my God. I'm going to kill this and I'll get
[9231.05s -> 9239.24s]  free. If he's going to kill this anyways, and why not just be able to put something out,
[9239.24s -> 9244.39s]  use the knife. I could. All right. Hold on. If he's going to kill this anyways,
[9244.39s -> 9252.57s]  why not just me kill it, be able to play the coyote next turn. Cause he's going to kill the
[9252.57s -> 9260.44s]  ant instead or wait till the queen comes up. I thought I had a lot of bone. Yeah. I thought I
[9260.44s -> 9268.98s]  did too. I thought I had a lot of bone makers. I'm going to, uh, whatever. If I lose, I lose.
[9268.98s -> 9275.08s]  I'm going to see what happens if I do this. Like this could be stupid, but what up? I'm going to
[9275.08s -> 9292.94s]  try it. I got the four. Okay. Now let's pull this. All right. So now I got to do one. It's
[9292.94s -> 9301.58s]  going to bounce off this anyways. So I'm going to have to put a pelt down. Pelt down here. Coyote.
[9301.58s -> 9307.77s]  It doesn't really matter where the coyote goes, right? So whatever. I'm in, I'm in trouble,
[9307.77s -> 9343.11s]  but what am I going to do about it? Oh my God. I'm like going to die. I think I might have to
[9343.11s -> 9374.25s]  open this. What does the knife do? Uh, okay. I can't do anything else. So, um, oh, I'm so
[9374.25s -> 9378.01s]  fucked. How am I supposed to do about this? That's how he had so much such an advantage.
[9378.01s -> 9386.70s]  I'm just dead. I'm going to lose. I, he started, I started, I, all the bones fucking ruined this
[9386.70s -> 9394.66s]  run. What did I say? Oh, hey guys, I didn't buy it. Get a bunch of bones. Cause I have so many bones,
[9394.66s -> 9406.38s]  uh, creators. I had like, I'm just dead. It's all right. I lose. What am I going to do here besides
[9406.38s -> 9417.69s]  this? I mean, I could just sit here and get killed. I'm not going to, this is over. I mean,
[9417.69s -> 9430.23s]  might as well just open this and see what it does. So I put this down. This is worth. So if I do this,
[9430.23s -> 9437.80s]  I get three blood. You have two lives. Oh my goodness. I do. Right. It's only for bosses when
[9437.80s -> 9449.08s]  he blows out the candle. So what, what should I do here? Kill the squirrel with this, put down the
[9449.08s -> 9470.42s]  queen or kill the coyote and go queen rattler. Okay. So who should I, if I sacrifice the squirrel,
[9470.42s -> 9475.00s]  then it's fine, right? Cause I'm still kind of confused how this works. So I, I'll get three.
[9475.00s -> 9489.42s]  So put that down. This is now, I can put this down here. I sacrifice this and then
[9489.42s -> 9497.43s]  let's be put this. I don't want this to die immediately, but I'm going to fucking
[9497.43s -> 9518.68s]  the ant down. Um, I don't know. World queen to ant bones. Um, did I not draw a card yet?
[9518.68s -> 9532.94s]  So should I kill the coyote? Like all this? Okay. I actually have no idea what's going on.
[9532.94s -> 9539.90s]  I, I'm just fucking dead anyways. I got to lose anyways. Like I'm not like I couldn't do anything
[9539.90s -> 9549.54s]  about it. I blow a candle out. Not disappointing. Believe it or not. You're not the first to lose
[9549.54s -> 9561.08s]  an eye here. Not much fun if you're half blind. Like to replace it perhaps. Oh, I wanted to see
[9561.08s -> 9570.63s]  what it looked like. I didn't get a chance to look at it. Choice is final. Okay. Wait, I get to keep
[9570.63s -> 9594.02s]  going. I wait, hold on a minute. I definitely don't want this, the goat. So it doesn't store it though.
[9594.02s -> 9599.86s]  So if I put this down and I use something that costs two blood, it's not like I get to keep
[9599.86s -> 9611.64s]  the other one blood in reserve. It just like up to three. So I have, okay. I understand. I get it.
[9611.64s -> 9615.91s]  So you would only want to use this if you had something that had at least two or more.
[9615.91s -> 9625.45s]  I get it. I get it. I understand. What does this do? This one's kind of interesting.
[9625.45s -> 9628.73s]  This is way too many bones. I need to get some, I need to do something. That's not,
[9628.73s -> 9653.32s]  I'm actually just take this or this is, I need damage. My deck kind of sucks before I'm gone
[9653.32s -> 9676.38s]  here. I don't get it. Okay. So this is health. Please know larva. Oh man. One three with poison
[9676.38s -> 9697.05s]  or Richard old one three with poison is pretty ridiculous. Yeah. And it's free. I would love to
[9697.05s -> 9709.11s]  see it. Let me see it right now. All right. This is not a bad start. Do you not have anything?
[9709.11s -> 9723.77s]  Okay. What do you got? Turkey. Okay. This is this annoying thing. All right. So I'm okay. I'm going
[9723.77s -> 9728.09s]  to put the, I'm going to put out me next turn. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We'll put a mole
[9728.09s -> 9740.33s]  man out right now. Let's go. Oh man. Or do I just wait till next turn? Like it's too late now.
[9792.60s -> 9810.42s]  Ah, I died. Oh my God. What am I doing? What happened? I don't know what I fucking did.
[9810.42s -> 9819.19s]  I thought I think I die anyways. Even if I didn't sacrifice the mole man. Yeah. Yeah. Stay there.
[9819.19s -> 9825.37s]  No need to move. I am afraid you are not dead yet. Yeah. Hold still. Where did I put that
[9825.37s -> 9839.99s]  camera of mine? Stop taking pictures. You don't have 30 HP. This is an art stone. I know, but
[9839.99s -> 9848.98s]  still, man, I took a picture. Wait, did I just take a picture of this guy? You really think I
[9848.98s -> 9853.96s]  would leave film in there? Do you have any idea what that camera is capable of? Give me that.
[9853.96s -> 9870.92s]  We have a memento to create. Behold your. Oh, I do a new one every turn. Oh no. I had a good one
[9870.92s -> 9900.73s]  last time. Cost? This is free. Power and health in the rattler. 31 sigils. I feel like the wolf
[9900.73s -> 9926.79s]  is better. Good Riddler. That's such a stupid. Fine. One thing remains. It must capture your
[9926.79s -> 9948.70s]  photo or whatever. Jeez. Oh, raid just came in. What? Hold on a minute. I got to correct this.
[9948.70s -> 9952.46s]  This is like, wait, this is like white. The light is white. I need to change that. That's why I look
[9952.46s -> 9982.86s]  like a fucking skeleton today. Hold on. Big raid. Big raid. Laniya Lazar. Lazar. I fucking said that's
[9982.86s -> 10002.95s]  so wrong. I'm so sorry that I oh my God, that's so fucking embarrassing and stupid. Thank you so
[10002.95s -> 10011.86s]  much for the raid. Welcome everybody. I look like such a fucking dickhead right now. Thank you so
[10011.86s -> 10022.01s]  much for the raid. Welcome everybody. It's a big raid. Yeah, if you don't know a lot, it's a Vtuber.
[10022.01s -> 10029.35s]  I've seen, I've watched. You don't think I don't know who that is? You don't think I don't know?
[10029.35s -> 10042.28s]  Now it's time for an apology. Here's the thing. Let me explain. I'm so sorry. I looked over here
[10042.28s -> 10048.95s]  and I just, my brain just immediately started reading and it's like I looked over and it just
[10048.95s -> 10059.16s]  was Laniya Lazar. I'm such a fucking dumbass. My brain has trouble sometimes, but I do appreciate
[10059.16s -> 10066.09s]  thanks. Welcome everybody. We're playing, uh, playing Inscription. Apology song. I'm not singing
[10066.09s -> 10093.30s]  an apology song to anybody. No. No apology song. Oh, I can see the music. Okay. You will learn as
[10093.30s -> 10102.89s]  we go or you will die. Hope you had a good stream though. Thank you. You see, he was defeated
[10102.89s -> 10114.41s]  recently and wishes to redeem himself. Ear wax in your eyes. My ears are clean. Relax. It would be
[10114.41s -> 10119.22s]  unfortunate if you were to fall to the prospector before he was given that chance. This hook is
[10119.22s -> 10124.82s]  powerful. You may steal one of my cards with it. For that reason, you will not find any others along
[10124.82s -> 10136.12s]  the path. Use it wisely. It seems the lowly stink bug has made its way in, but it is dealt so it
[10136.20s -> 10145.78s]  stands. What's going on? What's happening to everybody? Why are they all messed up? What
[10145.78s -> 10164.46s]  happened? I get to pick one. Yeah. Why is his head turning into a square? This is my deck right now.
[10164.46s -> 10171.40s]  Ah, I see. So, so let me guess it. So I beat two bosses, but the game is like, okay, you beat two
[10171.40s -> 10175.24s]  bosses. So we're just going to get you on the path to the last one you beat before the area you were
[10175.24s -> 10190.82s]  just in. Is that how that works? So I have to beat the angler again. No, I'm such a fucking idiot.
[10190.82s -> 10201.91s]  No, you may not choose a specific beast. Instead, you must now decide on a tribe that you prefer.
[10201.91s -> 10225.11s]  Yeah, I'm gonna go with insect. A randomly chosen insect card. Do you wish for something else?
[10225.11s -> 10244.98s]  What's wrong with insects? This game is crazy. I think the rules are kind of changing. Choose.
[10244.98s -> 10272.20s]  What am I choosing? This is for the cockroach card, which would be, this would be unkillable. Okay.
[10272.20s -> 10281.38s]  The old woman bared her teeth in satisfaction. Your first totem was complete. Many lives sigil
[10281.38s -> 10293.24s]  will now be marked upon all your squirrel creatures. Huh? If you lose this run, you are
[10293.24s -> 10313.98s]  fucked. I'm probably gonna man. Oh, oh, what the fuck, man? Is this what that looked like?
[10313.98s -> 10339.34s]  This is what that looked like. Holy shit. Looks like Dr. Robotnik. Somebody put a mustache right
[10339.34s -> 10373.64s]  here. Somebody put a mustache right there. That's fucked. Jesus. Hey. All right. So this thing,
[10373.64s -> 10379.83s]  what does this do again? What happened? So this can't die. So I can sacrifice a hundred times.
[10379.83s -> 10402.97s]  Hold on. Let me test this. So if I do bullfrog on this. What? Really? Oh, okay. How do I get rid
[10402.97s -> 10426.95s]  of them? But if it can't die, then okay. All right, dude. Relax here. Um, all right. I gotta do this.
[10430.70s -> 10443.32s]  Yeah. And then stink bug. I'm gonna save the stink bug because I'll put that out after this.
[10443.96s -> 10450.38s]  He sucks. I, dude, I, I don't, what do you, I don't know, man. Like I'm just trying to play the game.
[10450.38s -> 10458.31s]  I suck asshole at card games. Did you watch me play Hearthstone? Did you watch me play Hearthstone?
[10458.31s -> 10463.19s]  I just sometimes just put cards down because they look pretty. I, they look nice. I don't know. I,
[10463.19s -> 10487.50s]  by math in my head, I'm doing fine. I'm doing fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Total misplay.
[10487.50s -> 10509.62s]  Shut up. Again, I have to pick another. All right. So I'm doing insect again because it's an insect
[10509.62s -> 10528.84s]  build. Ant. Okay. Cool. I got a lot of teeth. Okay. Gently shaking hands. She placed her
[10528.84s -> 10538.30s]  offerings before you. Another offering. Uh, what's, I don't know. What am I picking here?
[10538.30s -> 10542.66s]  Okay. What does the snake head do? I didn't want to, I didn't want to pick the snake head. I just
[10542.66s -> 10547.05s]  want to see what it did. I don't know what, what, I don't know what I just did. What just happened?
[10547.05s -> 10566.63s]  I don't know what just happened. I wanted to look. What do I do? What, how do I fix this? Um,
[10566.63s -> 10578.07s]  eat the squirrel head. I don't understand what's happening. Do I click the squirrel head? Press S
[10578.07s -> 10582.36s]  keep squirrels. Does this mean I'm keeping the squirrel right here? Or does this mean I'm
[10582.36s -> 10596.87s]  keeping the squirrel? Click the squirrel. Now click this. Okay. I thought I could look at that.
[10596.87s -> 10601.51s]  No, dude. Okay. I wanted to read it. I thought I could read to see what it was going to do.
[10605.03s -> 10615.45s]  I just wanted to read it. I, it was like a snake head. I didn't know what that did. It's for
[10615.45s -> 10624.17s]  lizards. Right click to see it. I didn't have a book on it. All right. What do you got? Okay.
[10624.17s -> 10629.37s]  So it's going to go forward and then this way. I don't want anything right here, right? I want it
[10629.37s -> 10635.22s]  like here. Well, that was a dumb thing that I just did. I literally just said, don't put it there.
[10635.22s -> 10734.65s]  Bro, please. What? We got a good one. This looks like I have boogers coming out of my nose.
[10734.65s -> 10796.87s]  This one's good, but I'm not bald. Nosebleed. Uh, mantis. Who health? Who's wisely? The ant or the
[10796.87s -> 10819.10s]  wolf. Probably this would be good. This would be three, four for the mantis. One, four. Awkward
[10819.10s -> 10822.62s]  should be interesting because it was never, it would just always, but yeah, I think this would
[10822.62s -> 10834.62s]  kind of get in the way, wouldn't it? This would last too long, I think. Four bones. I'm not
[10834.62s -> 10861.59s]  bone generating. Put it on the mantis. What's this shit? All right. There's two birds. Uh,
[10861.59s -> 10880.17s]  I think I'm going to get this out here first. Oh shit. I need it. Okay. You don't get tokens for
[10880.17s -> 10924.10s]  that, huh? You back on the board. Yep. Ooh, wolf. All right. Uh, who do I want to get rid of you?
[10924.10s -> 10944.79s]  Cause you'll kill this whole row and that's good. That should be good to go. It should be good to
[10944.79s -> 10955.99s]  go. All right. Three. That'll kill, that won't kill this, but I think we're good. Don't read it
[10955.99s -> 10965.26s]  again. I'm not going to read it again. Ooh, mantis. Mantis in replace of the ant. It's just a better
[10965.26s -> 10977.59s]  ant. I mean, it's just a better ant and it'll hit. Yeah, let's do it. I wish I could get rid of this
[10977.59s -> 11000.89s]  game over. Let's see if I can do a ton of damage though. Cockroach. Nah, that's it. That's a lot of
[11000.89s -> 11021.11s]  gold. Elk fawn, Reginald again, and a river snapper. I mean, we have to take, and then we just
[11021.11s -> 11036.34s]  sacrifice. We're putting Reginald up to sacrifice now, right? Cause I'm generating very much bone
[11036.34s -> 11055.70s]  or that would be huge too. Cockroach or Reginald, which one? Who do I want to give that to? I mean,
[11055.70s -> 11073.86s]  probably mantis or probably Reginald. Maybe the mantis. Wolf is good. That's just very clean
[11073.86s -> 11094.20s]  though. Very clean. Ant. I don't, I don't have a queen ant though. I'm going mantis. I don't have
[11094.20s -> 11116.28s]  a queen ant. Okay. So this is the angler again, right? Hold on. I have to play the whole game
[11116.28s -> 11145.19s]  over again when I lose. It's a roguelike. That mule. Yep. I know what I'm doing. All right. Let's go.
[11146.66s -> 11194.12s]  Squirrel going out. You. Boom. You. Boom. Bullfrog. Stay. Okay. Now I get four bones when this is
[11194.12s -> 11208.74s]  broken. There we are. There we are. Check this out. We go one, two, smack that. We go one, two,
[11209.82s -> 11222.14s]  smack into that. We go. Let's see if I care. I don't care. Mantis. Good. Mantis is going to go.
[11222.78s -> 11233.22s]  I wish I could get rid of this. I don't want to. I wish I could delete the boulder.
[11233.22s -> 11258.02s]  Just don't just leave because he's going to kill everything. Yep. This is a jump. No,
[11263.64s -> 11268.52s]  can't do anything because it's just stuff in the way. So whatever. Just kill it please.
[11268.92s -> 11293.40s]  All right. Now. Perfect. Go and kill that please. Please hit that. I can't play anything.
[11293.40s -> 11313.99s]  I can't play anything. Just hit me. Thank you. I can't play a squirrel otherwise. I have too
[11313.99s -> 11325.58s]  many squirrels. I can't do anything still. I could do this. What am I going to do with all these?
[11333.45s -> 11369.86s]  All right. No. Use them as tanks. I can just do that. Yeah, that's over. How many levels are in
[11369.86s -> 11387.74s]  the game? Like how many areas? How many bosses are in the game? 20? When do you, how do you like
[11387.74s -> 11398.42s]  four? It's complicated. Don't ask that question. Okay. Brutant pack rat never dealt the utility
[11398.42s -> 11408.49s]  of a well-stocked pack. When a card bearing this is played, you will receive a random item as long
[11408.49s -> 11429.91s]  as your pack is not full. It seems broken. I just get an item every time I play the card.
[11433.69s -> 11436.57s]  All right. This is the last one I'm going to show. This is the last one I'm going to show.
[11436.57s -> 11453.62s]  I'm not showing anymore. Let's be very clear. This is the last one that we're going to show.
[11453.62s -> 11489.50s]  No more after this one. Yes. It's the funniest movie of the year. Let me think. The air grew thick
[11489.50s -> 11508.33s]  with void. All right. This is the, the angler. Wetlands. Pinky black mouth of a cave. Strange
[11508.33s -> 11515.80s]  beast lurked within. Spoke past one of my, did anybody have one? I did that like two years ago.
[11516.81s -> 11523.22s]  The clip of the, it's the funniest movie of the year. That was a joke we did, right?
[11524.20s -> 11533.53s]  Anybody have that clip? It was like a Bernie Sanders political ad, right?
[11533.53s -> 11542.84s]  Nobody cared enough. I thought that, I thought that was a great one. Pass one of my trials and
[11542.84s -> 11552.07s]  I'll be yours in a raspy voice. Three creatures will be drawn from your deck. They will decide
[11552.07s -> 11563.50s]  your success or failure, but first you will choose a trial. Trial of bones. The three drawn cards
[11563.50s -> 11571.77s]  must cost at least five bones combined to pass. Three drawn cards must have at least six health
[11571.77s -> 11587.77s]  combined to pass or at least three sigils among them to pass. We got it right here. Bernie approves
[11587.77s -> 11595.00s]  this message. Funniest movie of the year. Is this it? Sanders and I approve this message. My name
[11595.00s -> 11602.34s]  is Bernie Sanders and I approve this message. It's the funniest movie of the year. Critics
[11602.34s -> 11613.88s]  at Bernie Sanders are saying it's the best movie in February. Sonic the Hedgehog. Pretty PG.
[11613.88s -> 11629.67s]  Yeah, that's pretty funny. I like that was funny. What's wrong with that? All right. It's probably
[11629.67s -> 11644.58s]  health. I'm going to say health or sigils and I have like five. Every single one of my cards has
[11644.58s -> 11655.54s]  a sigil, doesn't it? I think it's I'm doing this one. I did it twice. How many times did I do that?
[11655.54s -> 11670.54s]  Hold on. There's a different one. It's the funniest movie of the year. That's not the same. Critics
[11670.54s -> 11680.89s]  are saying it's the best VR game of 2020. I've done that. Whatever. It's a funny routine. That's
[11680.89s -> 11701.24s]  a funny routine. I don't care. I think I'll do it again too. Got it. So what do I get for this?
[11701.32s -> 11714.47s]  Um, this is what is this? When a car, but this is so I get four bones and this dies
[11714.47s -> 11721.29s]  and it's got quills. This is underwater. So it's like stealth. That's actually kind of amazing,
[11721.29s -> 11728.39s]  but eight bones. Oh, that's way too much. Or copies comes back when it dies and it has that.
[11728.39s -> 11735.37s]  That one's not that great. I picked one of these two. Probably this one. Eight bones. When am I
[11735.37s -> 11749.51s]  ever going to have eight bones? I'm going to pick this one. Hmm. The amount of items you can carry
[11749.51s -> 11758.57s]  is three. And do you have three? Instead, perhaps you'll accept this gift from my friend.
[11758.57s -> 11769.02s]  Another pack rat? All right. All right. That's looking pretty good. I got two of these. Dude,
[11769.02s -> 11779.05s]  you fell off. You were using old jokes. I didn't, I just was remembering an old one. Okay. So this
[11779.05s -> 11789.19s]  is, so I might as well just use something, right? Because if I get an item, I might as well use
[11789.19s -> 11802.42s]  something. What does this one do again? No, I want, book one of my cards and take it as your own.
[11802.42s -> 11807.98s]  I'm not going to use the knife. That's probably going to come in handy later. I don't think I'm
[11807.98s -> 11811.34s]  going to use that. The knife, but the squirrel, probably the squirrel. Cause what the fuck? Who
[11811.34s -> 11816.98s]  cares? I have so many infinite squirrels. Yeah. What am I going to do with that? Here you go. Now
[11816.98s -> 11823.45s]  let's play and check this out. Ready? Watch this. This is something fucking crazy. I'll show you
[11823.45s -> 11851.45s]  right now. Bingo. Done. Flyers. Done. That's fine. I want you to kill it anyways. One, three. This
[11851.45s -> 11871.45s]  spot. You sure? Yeah. Don't question me. This is okay. This is fine. This is fine. This is fine.
[11871.45s -> 11889.08s]  I'll kill that. Okay. No, sorry. That'll die. This won't get killed next turn. And then, oh,
[11889.08s -> 11898.98s]  I just win. I think, oh, I just win in a minute. I was rip a tooth out and just get another, um,
[11898.98s -> 11926.06s]  I think I fucked it up. Okay. Uh, I think I just have to go. All right. How can I kill now?
[11926.06s -> 11940.28s]  Stink bug is one, two. I will kill that. Pack rat. I really want that stump to die. Oh, there we go.
[11940.28s -> 11946.78s]  Okay. Game over. But should I, I'm going to get an item first. Oh, who cares? Just fucking win.
[11946.78s -> 11954.78s]  Just one. Yeah. Who gives a shit? Who gives a shit, right? Yeah. Who gives a shit? Wait, who gives
[11954.78s -> 11974.22s]  a shit, right? Whatever. Who gives a shit? I win. I don't want a bullfrog. I don't know if I want
[11974.22s -> 11988.38s]  that. Ooh, I'll take this one. Mushroom land. Thick and pungent mushrooms. You squint to see a figure
[11988.38s -> 11998.90s]  through a thick cloud of spores. We are the mysologists. Yes. And we are performing our
[11998.90s -> 12008.33s]  experiments far from. We are not welcome elsewhere. We will experiment on your flock. Yes. We will need
[12008.33s -> 12032.60s]  two of the same creature. I have two pack rats. This could get messy. Look away. Oh, that's pretty
[12032.60s -> 12043.70s]  huge. That's a big deal. I'll take it. Does the sigil stack? That would be amazing if it did. I
[12043.70s -> 12053.90s]  don't know. All right. We've got B. These are going to fly over me, so it doesn't matter. I'll put
[12053.90s -> 12108.25s]  out here. We'll go blink and doesn't really matter. So the blink. It's fine. All right. Pack this up.
[12121.77s -> 12168.62s]  Oops. Fuck. I think I screwed this up. I'm in a lot of trouble now. I need to do. I'm just so bad
[12168.62s -> 12174.15s]  with like placement and like thinking two, three turns ahead in games like these. There's no car I
[12174.15s -> 12184.60s]  can just drive into like a wall. You know what I mean? Like I have trouble with these. Stink bug
[12184.60s -> 12190.84s]  is going to drop down. Put the stink bug here, right? Because then if this take this can't do
[12190.84s -> 12203.37s]  anything, I might just be dead. I think I just lose. I'd have to use the knife. Yeah, I have to.
[12203.37s -> 12236.98s]  Okay. Now it's sold. Oh, I fucked it up. I whatever. It doesn't matter. I just I have so much
[12236.98s -> 12243.64s]  trouble like thinking two or three turns ahead and like, I don't know. ADHD is just like, well,
[12243.64s -> 12256.15s]  what do these do again? I don't remember. All right. Okay. If I get hit one more time,
[12256.15s -> 12272.62s]  it's over. That's two. I pull another squirrel hook something just too many, too many options
[12272.62s -> 12288.01s]  for my brain to focus on. Use the rat. Yeah, but I just okay. I wish I could just like pull the
[12288.01s -> 12298.47s]  camera out. You know what I mean? I wish I could see my hand and the board at the same time. So
[12298.47s -> 12307.82s]  I wonder if I should. Okay. I got to make a fucking play here. I get to sit here. I can't
[12307.82s -> 12316.36s]  just hit her and cycle menus. This is to if I go bang, I'm going to pull a squirrel. Fuck it.
[12316.36s -> 12328.42s]  Whatever. I'm going to die anyways. Oh, squirrel bang bang. That'll kill this whole row and then
[12328.42s -> 12337.90s]  see what happens. I guess. Oh shit. It's going to went over right. Oh, fuck. It's not much
[12337.90s -> 12361.05s]  trouble. What's this new item? I just want to look over there. I don't know to do. I could fishing
[12361.05s -> 12379.83s]  hook the which I fishing at the stump or the be D to look at items or damage. Yeah, but is it going
[12379.83s -> 12409.40s]  to? All right, let's go. I don't think I do anything. I'm kind of screwed because I can't
[12409.40s -> 12415.53s]  get rid of those squirrels. I could use this here. All right, I'm going to try. I'm going to go for
[12415.53s -> 12457.96s]  this. I draw this. All right, Wolf 32. I can't remove this shit. I think that's going to do it.
[12457.96s -> 12468.07s]  Yeah. Yeah, I just my brain is so much trouble. Just so I never play games like this because it's
[12468.07s -> 12476.02s]  like I just get lost looking at like the cards and then I go. Wait, I don't even know what to do.
[12476.02s -> 12489.62s]  Let's take this one. Happy with that one. Find salvation. Cuckoo clock. I didn't already do
[12489.62s -> 12527.29s]  the clock. I did the clock already bugs. Take the film roll before he sees it now. What are you
[12527.29s -> 12536.65s]  doing over there? He's self gaslighting. I just you give me a dodge roll and I'll fucking beat
[12536.65s -> 12542.20s]  that game. All right, I got film for the camera. So does it mean can I take a picture of him now?
[12542.20s -> 12574.79s]  He's gaslighting himself. Don't look around some more. One. What is this for? Oh my God, that's
[12574.79s -> 12613.29s]  fucking weird. I did that. Is the eyes turning on do anything? Does this mean anything to do the
[12613.29s -> 12625.56s]  game board puzzles? I did all of them already. I did them all. I already because this there was
[12625.56s -> 12643.66s]  a card here before. I don't know what it was. I keep going. I think I have full items.
[12643.66s -> 12655.16s]  So let's go this way. Move with a certain figure in spite of her considerable age. Yeah. So this
[12655.16s -> 12664.66s]  is this I don't want to do anything about this, right? Keep the squirrel. Yeah, I don't really
[12664.66s -> 12678.06s]  want to. I guess I could have gone to the backpack. Fix the squirrel. I'll keep the squirrel head
[12678.06s -> 12690.55s]  though. Is it bug build? The squirrel I think is fucking me up. I keep putting out too many and
[12690.55s -> 12696.07s]  then I just like I get like overwhelmed with what I need to do next turn. Maybe I should try the
[12696.07s -> 12713.72s]  bug. You'll get used to it. You need two cost cards in your deck. I'll try. I'll keep it.
[12713.72s -> 12721.74s]  Let me try the bug. I'm just curious what this does. I have like a yeah I'm gonna try. I have a
[12721.74s -> 12739.70s]  ton of bugs. Half my deck is bugs. Let me try it. I can always put it back on, right? I oughta thank
[12739.70s -> 12747.51s]  you. How has it been? It has been what is going on with this guy? I'm trapped in the body of a stote
[12747.51s -> 12756.39s]  in the paper of a card. I see that and I have of course set up a way to reset once more. Go on.
[12756.39s -> 12768.42s]  A player friend here. They already hold the key. What are they? What are they turning into? Like a
[12768.42s -> 12782.84s]  tv. Okay ants. Just gotta be careful. The number of ants is a problem. Let's go this way. What does
[12782.84s -> 12797.54s]  this do? Just this is 2-2. This will kill this if I I'm gonna put it here. Here we are. Yeah this
[12797.54s -> 12824.79s]  would have killed it. So I mean I gotta get hurt but oh god. Maybe that was a bad idea. Oh yeah yay.
[12824.79s -> 12838.01s]  I gotta hook something. I think I have to otherwise I'm just gonna lose right now. What should I pull?
[12838.01s -> 12853.18s]  One of the ants? No. Skink probably. Why did everybody want me to do the ringworm? Doesn't work
[12853.18s -> 12871.67s]  like this. It only pulls the front one. Oh I'll take one of the ants because now this will live
[12871.67s -> 12882.28s]  forever technically. So wait can I I can sacrifice that now like this right? This is correct right?
[12882.28s -> 12902.98s]  Tell me I'm tell me I'm a good boy. Tell me I'm a good boy. Okay I found the stunted wolf. I've seen
[12902.98s -> 12912.12s]  this play out enough times to know that plan is in motion. Make haste. You're oh you're a bug right?
[12912.12s -> 12926.18s]  This will clear all this. I think I just win. Pretty sure this is just a win right now. I think
[12926.18s -> 12962.94s]  so. Is it right? One more. You're such a good boy. This was cool. I'll do this one again. Oh you've
[12962.94s -> 12971.82s]  been such a good boy this year. Everything has a sigil right? So three drawn cards must be.
[12971.82s -> 12981.16s]  Every card I have is a sigil. Your scare cam is blocking the text. What's a good place to put the
[12981.16s -> 13012.14s]  camera then? What? Oh I passed. This is always three blood and it okay that beehive. This is never
[13012.14s -> 13028.50s]  going to attack right? This doesn't attack. It has no attack right? These all stink. I would pick this
[13028.50s -> 13042.60s]  one. Four bones. This one's not bad but bad roll. So if this attacks will it actually because this
[13042.60s -> 13045.24s]  these things don't attack because it's not gonna hurt anything. Does it actually just have to
[13045.24s -> 13051.61s]  physically move or does it actually actually have to hurt something? You could sacrifice this one.
[13051.61s -> 13081.91s]  I'll take it for the bugs. Oh you can't use that. What the hell is this? What? This bottle of goo
[13081.91s -> 13121.13s]  has no use. All right angler time let's go. Huge man approached. Go fish. You guys use it? I'm
[13121.13s -> 13126.18s]  serious you cannot use that. There's no possible use for it. I'll place it on that shelf over there
[13126.18s -> 13213.61s]  for now. I need my advice avoided. Oh oh oh it's oh shit I'm an idiot. No oh it's fucking nice drop.
[13213.61s -> 13236.23s]  I can't play this game. I would have done whatever. Fuck. Shit. If I had gone this way it would have
[13236.23s -> 13274.36s]  I would have had four teeth land. Ah whatever. All right it'll do the damage fine. One two three four.
[13274.36s -> 13290.44s]  I can't really do anything. I can put a squirrel here. I think I just have to go right? Oh I can
[13290.52s -> 13296.47s]  sacrifice that. I didn't think I could. I thought I had to get killed. Okay I didn't know I could
[13296.47s -> 13300.87s]  sacrifice it. I didn't think it was an actual. I thought sacrifice. This is so loud I need to turn
[13300.87s -> 13307.21s]  this down so I can hear myself think. Um I thought I didn't think this was like a thing to sacrifice.
[13307.21s -> 13330.50s]  Okay so I'm gonna put the adder over here and that'll kill that. All right I'm back in business.
[13330.50s -> 13343.69s]  Take this stupid squirrel. Come on. Thank god. He's I'm not I'm not panicking. I'm not panicking. I'm
[13343.69s -> 13370.54s]  all right. I'll turn it up for you. I just don't want to hear it. I'm kind of in trouble here.
[13370.54s -> 13418.07s]  I should go put him here. Oh where I? What the hell is in here? Okay this is frozen away. Will
[13418.07s -> 13432.66s]  this help me here? Okay so if I put that in front of one of these guys here that'll block and then
[13433.22s -> 13455.13s]  come back to life? Could I sacrifice this now? Would that be stupid? All right well
[13458.55s -> 13473.66s]  I don't know. I have to pull a tooth. Save your head on stream? I don't think so. See what happens.
[13474.22s -> 13497.30s]  Okay now let's scroll down. Sacrifice squirrel and the frozen thing and then I can use this and
[13497.30s -> 13521.26s]  that'll kill it. That's right. Wolf then fan. Okay so now I go squirrel mantis and then bang
[13521.26s -> 13531.72s]  I win. Does it matter where I put this guy? Right here and then that's free. Do I need to use the fan?
[13531.72s -> 13548.82s]  I think it'll just work right? Do I have to use the fan? Fan. Yo let's go! See I just need like to look
[13548.82s -> 13562.52s]  over it have you guys play the game for me because I can't fucking do this. We're good.
[13571.96s -> 13587.27s]  Oh we got a we got a Gek. I always take the Gek always every time. This game is really fun. I think
[13587.27s -> 13593.86s]  it's a good game. My brain just okay what here's the thing when I'm streaming my brain is going in
[13594.50s -> 13600.12s]  two different directions. This is the type of game that I would like be on the toilet and just be
[13600.12s -> 13610.10s]  like and each turn I get to sit there for like fucking 15 minutes. If I sit here for 15 minutes
[13610.10s -> 13616.55s]  and just go like this then like people are going to be like what's wrong with his brain? Is he
[13616.55s -> 13624.33s]  all right? What is he? Hello is he alive? What's he doing? Why is it taking him so long? I would
[13624.33s -> 13635.16s]  sit there like this and I would like get up and eat a sandwich probably halfway through one of
[13635.16s -> 13646.92s]  these. I think it's great. I love this but when I'm streaming like it's my brain is like operating
[13646.92s -> 13658.49s]  in two different places. All right we're back in the snow. Let me at least beat this part. Oh move
[13658.49s -> 13674.68s]  the camera right. Sorry we do a sweat check. No it's like yellow under there. No it's not. Shut up.
[13674.68s -> 13684.42s]  It's not. I'm kidding. It's a joke. I actually am sweating. I'm fucking kidding. It's not. Look see
[13684.42s -> 13696.71s]  see it's a joke. It's the light. I have a yellow light burning down on me. It's not. I have a
[13696.71s -> 13726.39s]  yellow light right here. Look you see. Look at it's yellow right there. Yeah this is this is this is
[13726.39s -> 13749.90s]  like this. Is this on iPad? No. Oh this thing is ridiculous so I'm taking this. It's coming to
[13749.90s -> 13776.38s]  switch soon. Oh that's awesome. All right health. I mean nine health. Oh I gotta let. Hold on. I
[13776.38s -> 13783.30s]  gotta talk about what's going on tomorrow. Tomorrow we are going. Just because there's a lot of people
[13783.30s -> 13792.89s]  here. Tomorrow we are going to be playing Elden Ring PVP. Tomorrow is very important. I'm not
[13792.89s -> 13803.72s]  ending this. The stream's not over yet. Elden Ring PVP with the intention of finding my champions
[13803.72s -> 13814.04s]  because Ludwig and I are doing a 1v1 community versus community trial by combat night. He's
[13814.04s -> 13817.72s]  look he's got his own shit. He's got his own shit going. He's got his own community to worry about
[13817.72s -> 13829.53s]  right. He's gonna find the community kind of champions there. I'm picking mine tomorrow and
[13829.53s -> 13838.54s]  we use rivers of blood. Now that's a good question. We're probably gonna we're probably going to I
[13838.54s -> 13846.04s]  would assume maybe we'll ban a few items. We'll find out. We have to have some rules. We're not
[13846.04s -> 13851.46s]  sure what those rules are yet. What's the rune level? We'll figure that out in the next day or
[13851.46s -> 13858.14s]  so. Let's have a ban list. But tomorrow we're gonna mess around again. That was so much fun
[13858.14s -> 13861.90s]  just doing PVP invasion night. I want to do it again. I had a lot of fun doing it. It was awesome.
[13863.50s -> 13868.60s]  But the biggest intention tomorrow is to find who I want as my champions.
[13868.60s -> 13874.55s]  We're later on probably this coming week. This weekend. I'm really tired and want to go to bed.
[13874.55s -> 13879.51s]  I'm not going to go that long tonight. And if you want to know am I going to play this again?
[13881.46s -> 13889.74s]  Yeah. Yeah. Am I am I capable of playing this again? You think so? I really like it but I have
[13889.74s -> 13896.15s]  trouble. I have a lot of trouble. Maybe you guys can help me. Maybe you guys can help me play it.
[13898.94s -> 13907.40s]  All right. What do I want plus two health? I love the concept of this game. I love it.
[13907.40s -> 13918.12s]  Am I just my brain is cross-eyed when I play a game like this. It's really as good as a good game.
[13918.12s -> 13922.76s]  No. I mean it is. This is awesome. I love the art. I love the lore. I love the atmosphere.
[13922.76s -> 13930.73s]  If you guys can help me. I don't care about that. Right. Whatever. All right. I was thinking moose
[13930.73s -> 13942.38s]  buck or or geck. I'm sorry. I'm so scatterbrained. I just you know what I just my brain has so much
[13942.38s -> 13951.46s]  trouble sitting here and like doing this. So if you came here looking for a you know like oh I
[13951.46s -> 13956.10s]  I won't come on like why the fuck can't you do this? I apologize. I'm sorry. I hope it's like
[13956.10s -> 13963.99s]  fun. I'm having fun. I hope you're having fun. My brain is just can't like focus. It's stupid.
[13963.99s -> 13986.55s]  Okay. We're good. Okay. So what's the what's the stipulation here? Thorns. Okay. Cool. Yeah.
[13986.55s -> 14003.30s]  Ooh. Right off the bat. Over on the right. What do you think? I know exactly how you feel. You're
[14003.30s -> 14009.35s]  doing better than I did. Yeah. I know. I know sometimes I'm concerned about being an absolute
[14009.35s -> 14013.51s]  like idiot in the game and people just sit here calling like dude what the fuck are you doing man?
[14014.23s -> 14035.75s]  I'm gonna say all the way to the right and then a squirrel and then we go is your first try.
[14036.39s -> 14040.09s]  Yeah. I know. I'm just having fun. I'm just having fun. I just really don't want people to
[14040.97s -> 14049.75s]  think um oh do I really care about being like an idiot? I don't know. I literally like ate bubble
[14049.83s -> 14057.34s]  soap two days ago. I'm concerned about looking stupid in a video game. Oh really? Uh what? All
[14057.34s -> 14075.02s]  right. Here we go. I'm bringing out the uh I'm bringing out the moose. No. Bring out the wolf.
[14075.02s -> 14091.61s]  Shit. I don't know. Should I put them? Oh that hurts a lot. Thankfully it moved over there
[14091.61s -> 14115.98s]  though. Okay. Fuck that hurt. I need the moose. Do I live? If I don't I think I live one more time.
[14117.30s -> 14122.94s]  I don't know what to do. Grab another squirrel next turn. Oh actually I'm not this is okay.
[14123.58s -> 14158.28s]  Okay this is all right. This is not bad. So now I can sacrafo- oh I think I'm dead. Game over Andy.
[14158.28s -> 14167.26s]  Okay well whatever. Let's just uh just kill me. I lose anyways. Do I live one more turn? No.
[14168.06s -> 14187.80s]  Yeah I just lose. I want to at least see the other boss right? Do I even have any
[14187.80s -> 14201.02s]  health? Oh I know. Okay. That's it. I don't want anymore. I look around the room. No I have I have
[14201.02s -> 14214.87s]  I've done um a lot of stuff I could do so far right? Yeah let's just I did the clock. I did
[14214.87s -> 14220.62s]  the little minigames here. I did the sword, the dagger right? Took that and I did all that. Yeah
[14222.02s -> 14231.61s]  oh wait a minute this is the goo right? Keep sealed. Pain is unbearable even after all these
[14231.61s -> 14240.23s]  years. What do you want? I have very little to live for these days. You have the master's eye.
[14240.23s -> 14250.46s]  Does this mean the master can see me? Magnificus. Can you see me? Can you free me? It is done.
[14250.46s -> 14259.80s]  Master is free. Well the end must be close now. If Magnificus is free it must be close.
[14259.80s -> 14266.92s]  Watching the angler lose now that soothed my pain. An old rival of mine that fisherman. He
[14266.92s -> 14272.60s]  bested me this time but I will have another chance. Oh I see you have a little something
[14272.60s -> 14278.12s]  special up your sleeve. Fear not I won't blow your cover. You just need to get a hold of that
[14278.12s -> 14287.50s]  camera of his. Maybe if you defeated him you would get a chance. So I have to like beat the game and
[14287.50s -> 14311.10s]  then take a picture of him. Interesting. Very interesting. I want more buffs. Plus two health.
[14311.10s -> 14356.12s]  Echo again. One five or adder. I'm gonna do adder. I feel like that's very useful. All right I did it.
[14356.12s -> 14383.21s]  I bite my lip and I don't want people to see. Bad habit. All right squirrel, mantis. Seems like a
[14383.21s -> 14429.90s]  good idea. And then bullfrog. Is that a stupid idea? All right okay I got it. Bingo. Porcupine
[14429.90s -> 14452.94s]  going in. Um which will give me the bones to put Reginald to kill this. Then this can go here.
[14454.34s -> 14469.82s]  Then you will kill that. Then I will take one tooth worth of damage. Now I kind of need a squirrel
[14469.82s -> 14489.67s]  and then hit the pass button. All right okay. Okay now. Oh that's too bad. Do I keep Reginald there
[14489.67s -> 14509.11s]  and just pass? I think so. I think I'm all right. Okay all right now that kills that. Let me take a
[14509.11s -> 14516.23s]  look at the board. This kills this. This is gonna just hit that. There'll be another one of these
[14516.23s -> 14527.88s]  coming down. Oh okay. This is gonna swing. This is gonna come down and hit and then go over here.
[14527.88s -> 14542.66s]  So I'll put the adder here. Eventually this kills that. This stays here. This is gonna move down.
[14542.66s -> 14554.09s]  I put the adder here but I can't really do that yet so I'm gonna pass again. Confirm. Confirm.
[14554.65s -> 14595.50s]  Confirm with me. Confirm. Adder kills rock. And now I got two squirrels. Adder. Bang. Bang. Good.
[14595.50s -> 14605.38s]  Another squirrel. We're good. Very nice. Because that was gonna bounce over here.
[14605.38s -> 14627.37s]  Okay grab another squirrel. So Wolf will kill that. Hold on a second. I want to place this right now
[14627.37s -> 14639.98s]  and then we go boink boink. Because then that'll move down here right? That didn't do what I
[14639.98s -> 14665.08s]  thought it was gonna do. I think I win. That is it. Game over. Game over. I win. See? I am smart.
[14665.08s -> 14681.98s]  See? There's something in there. It's not empty. It's watch. Apparently it's made out of metal.
[14681.98s -> 14711.21s]  Hold on. Can I make it like sound hollow? I'm smart. Me smart. All right show me some pelts.
[14711.21s -> 14728.94s]  Okay. Raven egg. That's new. Goat seems good. Just beaver. Sounds kind of good too.
[14728.94s -> 14754.34s]  Gross. Raven egg. Okay this is important. Mantis god. I don't even care about the others. I want
[14754.34s -> 14776.57s]  that one. Okay. I want to put the mantis god up there and I want to give the mantis god something
[14776.57s -> 14798.92s]  crazy. Oh my god. Adder. Boom. Yeah. Adder for sure. I did the wrong way? No I didn't. Is this
[14798.92s -> 14804.01s]  not backwards? Is it backwards? No it's not. This is the thing that you're sacrificing. The thing up
[14804.01s -> 14811.64s]  top. I'm good. Yeah it's not backwards. You just made me freak out. All right we're doing Adder.
[14811.64s -> 14827.88s]  This is gonna be amazing. There's only one health glob. Wow. That's really cool. Okay let's see.
[14827.88s -> 14856.68s]  I hope I get it. These are gonna turn into something crazy. I mean I'm gonna put that out
[14856.68s -> 14876.79s]  here. Okay. Um I can't do anything really. I could. Oh wait. Hold on. Wait. Wait. This comes back.
[14876.79s -> 14897.26s]  So I sacrifice. Put the wolf here. So it'll kill that and do up there. Okay. Nice. Yo what the
[14897.26s -> 14912.63s]  fuck? Wait. Wait. What the fuck happened? What? I died instantly. Oh my god. What happened? Crap.
[14912.63s -> 14918.79s]  Oh that's so sad. I thought I was fine. The fly. Yeah the fly. But I thought I didn't think I was
[14918.79s -> 14939.78s]  gonna die in one turn. Shit. Okay one cost. They're all one. Doesn't matter. Power and health.
[14939.78s -> 14973.05s]  Gonna be this. Sigils. I mean yeah mantis god. God. Hey chapstick boy. How are your lips? Thanks
[14973.05s -> 14991.53s]  for the reminder. Yeah we're not gonna start at six o'clock. What are you looking at? Keep your eyes
[14991.53s -> 14999.90s]  on me. That foul stunted wolf. You really want such a creature in your deck? The sight of it does try
[14999.90s -> 15017.27s]  my temper. But it has been dealt. So it stands. Don't forget to. Don't. Don't do that. What's this?
[15017.83s -> 15027.05s]  Different kind of choice. Choose not a specific beast. Decide the cost that you wish to pay.
[15032.39s -> 15049.48s]  All right probably one. Lewis. A weird card. Stealth and moves around. I feel like that's kind of
[15049.48s -> 15062.76s]  pain in the ass. You're kidding me. I've been typing chapstick chaps in chat for months and
[15062.76s -> 15088.94s]  nobody else does it. Oh when when this is the worst card ever. I think it's gonna be you.
[15088.94s -> 15091.90s]  Chapstick. I keep running into these. I gotta take a look at the map before I do this.
[15092.14s -> 15125.66s]  Okay um. Defeat him first. Two four. Holy shit. I'm gonna put you over here. No I just woke up from
[15125.66s -> 15142.06s]  that. I'm sorry. He's still in act one? Dude. I don't. I know. But whatever. I'm having a good
[15142.06s -> 15154.04s]  time. Who cares? Somebody said it was gonna take him 10 hours to get out of act one. He hates this
[15154.04s -> 15159.86s]  game? No I do not. Who said that? I think this is fun. I did not say it. I think this is really
[15159.86s -> 15172.81s]  genuinely cool. Okay so um. That'll kill that. I've got this defense here. So we're just gonna go
[15173.53s -> 15199.16s]  whack and then we're gonna go whack. We know when you hate something is when you growl at us.
[15199.16s -> 15225.24s]  I don't have enough money. All right so I did that for a little while. Thinking about going back to
[15225.24s -> 15238.25s]  squirrel. Like all squirrels have flight? Oops that was not good. That's not what I wanted.
[15238.25s -> 15265.18s]  Squirrels can't even attack man. Oh great. Good idea. It's all right. We're good. We're good. It's
[15265.18s -> 15312.23s]  gonna be fine. Why did that not work? And we have to use Lois. Ow. Oh what a perfect draw. I want to
[15312.23s -> 15331.62s]  do this again so bad. All right you suck. I'm putting you here instead. You have me here. I
[15331.62s -> 15354.79s]  surrender. Why would you do that? I'm losing. No. All right nice. I'll get you this next round.
[15358.63s -> 15371.98s]  I'm really good in act one. If you want a really good puzzle game just try The Witness.
[15371.98s -> 15385.29s]  I don't really like those kind of puzzles. I'm more into the puzzles that go like and they open
[15385.29s -> 15397.48s]  and stuff. That's my favorite. If a puzzle game has like a draw that opens like puzzle noises.
[15397.48s -> 15404.25s]  Yeah like escape rooms. You know okay. Does anybody here want a multi-billion dollar idea?
[15404.25s -> 15412.34s]  I'll give it to you. I have a multi-trillion dollar idea. Good luck whoever wants to do it because
[15412.34s -> 15418.73s]  like I'm not gonna do it but I'll give it to you. I just want five percent of every sale. So I made
[15418.73s -> 15425.00s]  it up. So I will tell you right now I want five percent of all your sales. Have an escape room.
[15425.00s -> 15433.88s]  That's not an escape room. It is just a huge box that has all the like kind of box puzzle game
[15433.88s -> 15440.49s]  shit. Like you know the box inside of the box that has like the key. You have to twist like the bottom
[15440.49s -> 15445.37s]  that pulls out the little thing that has to go into the slot that's on top. Which then the whole
[15445.37s -> 15452.09s]  thing opens up and there's a big thing in here that you have to figure out. A huge puzzle box.
[15452.09s -> 15461.37s]  That's not a toy store. It's yeah the room. The room but real. Actually make it. And the thing
[15461.37s -> 15472.20s]  takes like three hours to complete. So the thing starts as like a cube. Right? A huge cube that's
[15472.20s -> 15477.98s]  a big wooden box and there's a padlock on the left of it underneath. And it's like okay what's that?
[15477.98s -> 15481.18s]  Well there's a little device over here that you have to look at that'll give you those three
[15481.18s -> 15485.82s]  numbers. When you do the three numbers in the padlock that thing opens. Like a little tray comes
[15485.82s -> 15490.22s]  out and there's a key in there. You take the key out. There's a keyhole that's on top of the box.
[15490.22s -> 15496.52s]  You stick it in. Open the top of the box. Inside of that comes up pops up another big puzzle.
[15499.59s -> 15505.51s]  Every time I played a game like The Room I go my god I wish I could I would I would pay an
[15505.51s -> 15513.38s]  exorbitant amount of money to do this in real life. An escape room that's not an escape room.
[15513.38s -> 15520.82s]  An escape room that's condensed inside of a gigantic like three hour puzzle box. And this
[15520.82s -> 15527.85s]  thing could be four three four five feet tall and like five feet wide. That's what an escape room is.
[15527.85s -> 15531.37s]  No escape room is like all spread out. I'm talking condensed in like go play The Room and you know
[15531.37s -> 15534.57s]  what I'm talking about. There's a billion dollar idea. Five percent of every sale thank you.
[15534.57s -> 15543.66s]  Oh by the way if you don't if I don't get five percent of sale. Oh god lawyers.
[15545.98s -> 15559.42s]  You'd be in trouble. I'm gonna take Reginald. Your pack was full so give me something cool.
[15559.42s -> 15573.93s]  This is worth just going here with full um full items. Why not? Wouldn't The Room just get five
[15573.93s -> 15586.34s]  percent? Imagine you made like a puzzle box thing and I heard about it. And I mean that's not like
[15586.42s -> 15590.89s]  that that's like that's an idea that probably everybody's probably thought of. And I'm like
[15590.89s -> 15599.85s]  demanding five percent. I said on my stream that a big puzzle box was a good idea. Yeah you know
[15599.85s -> 15608.07s]  what's had this great idea? Jeffrey the giraffe from Toys R Us. He has a whole store full of them.
[15608.07s -> 15636.36s]  You guys know who Jeffrey the giraffe is? I don't want to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid.
[15636.36s -> 15641.24s]  I always want to be a Toys R Us kid. Now that those commercials would have been really funny
[15641.24s -> 15650.41s]  if they got like a 50 year old guy to do it right. Because like I don't want to grow up.
[15650.41s -> 15657.56s]  I'm never going to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid. And the guy's like 50 like dancing around the
[15657.56s -> 15672.41s]  store brainwashing. I don't want to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid. That would be like kind of
[15672.41s -> 15679.45s]  fucked up. I don't yeah that wouldn't be all right. That guy no but they said that it was like I don't
[15679.45s -> 15702.47s]  ever want I'm never going to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid forever. I don't want to grow up. I'm part
[15702.47s -> 15721.53s]  of the Drew crew. Yeah and he's like he's like kind of like in his 50s you know he's like acid
[15721.53s -> 15729.86s]  reflux. I don't want to grow up. I'll always be a Toys R Us kid. That's how the commercial ends.
[15729.86s -> 15748.23s]  His like stomach goes up a little. He's got like a hot dog in one of his hands. All right Reginald I
[15748.23s -> 15762.23s]  want you to kill. What's wrong with this guy? I just fucking lost the game again didn't I? No I
[15762.23s -> 15774.34s]  didn't. Back right. Do I have three items? All right let me see the items. I don't look over this
[15774.34s -> 15780.79s]  way. Whatever dude I want to open up the squirrel thing. That's two. I need to go bang bang. I
[15780.79s -> 15800.98s]  actually don't need to use it yet but I might. Whatever I'm an idiot. Your puke noises are so
[15800.98s -> 15805.69s]  gross. This is a terrible play. I should have just opened up the fucking thing. What happens if I
[15805.69s -> 15824.86s]  I pull this back. Cancel this so I can break this. I don't I I mean I thought I could pull it back
[15824.86s -> 15832.60s]  for a second. I always want to be a Toys R Us. Okay I'm done. I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow.
[15832.68s -> 15852.20s]  I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm out of here. You know that I have a video of me with no shirt
[15852.20s -> 15862.12s]  on that I recorded like 10 of these on my phone and it's me board facing the camera like board
[15862.12s -> 15869.18s]  facing this way with no shirt on. It looks like I have a huge fat stomach and it's me saying that
[15869.18s -> 15880.15s]  I was gonna try out to be the next Armin for Attack on Titan and at the end I go like Aaron
[15881.11s -> 15888.50s]  Aaron run away and then I go and when I do that I fart in real life and just Holly just starts
[15888.50s -> 15900.01s]  laughing her ass off. Um the video is fucking crazy. It's like I went like too much. I went like too
[15900.01s -> 15912.26s]  hard and you just hear Holly start laughing. Will you ever show that? Maybe. Maybe one day.
[15912.26s -> 15927.80s]  Maybe one day. Maybe one day you'll see. Ooh one day maybe you'll see it. Randomly one day maybe
[15927.80s -> 15939.99s]  I'll just be like you know who cares. I don't even give a shit who gives a fuck. You can't say that
[15939.99s -> 15945.66s]  and not show it. Yeah well just maybe one day I'll fucking put it up. Make it a main channel vid.
[15945.66s -> 15960.46s]  At least do the audio. You know I could I could do the audio and I would also probably yeah okay
[15960.46s -> 15968.65s]  maybe. I've recorded here's the thing I recorded maybe 10 of them so there's like 10 versions of
[15968.65s -> 15975.77s]  this. I really think a lot of people think I'm making this up when I say that I will just sit
[15975.77s -> 15983.27s]  there and just do something like that over and over again and just I don't know I said maybe
[15983.27s -> 15993.56s]  something wrong with me. I don't know. I fell asleep two days ago to a like seven or eight
[15993.56s -> 15998.82s]  hour Kathy Mitchell playlist of various like infomercials and her showing cooking food and
[15998.82s -> 16008.49s]  stuff. It's like it's like better than television to me. The like eight hour Kathy Mitchell playlist
[16008.49s -> 16018.58s]  is more entertaining to me than like Mad Men. I don't I don't know why. I don't know I don't
[16018.58s -> 16037.72s]  understand why. Imagine picking Bird with like that would be stupid. You just say things. I mean
[16038.36s -> 16049.91s]  I I I don't know and no I didn't guys. I gotta be clear. I don't I didn't fart 10 times in a row.
[16049.91s -> 16064.44s]  I just on like the seventh or eighth one. It was like this did I want to leak this so bad.
[16064.44s -> 16070.52s]  It's an idea and I want to leak it but I kind of I can't because if I ever actually get to do it
[16070.52s -> 16078.73s]  because what if it doesn't happen then maybe maybe you'll never know. Not this. I'm talking
[16078.73s -> 16094.09s]  about something else. No I'm not going to leak it. I'm not going to leak this thing I'm talking
[16094.09s -> 16097.13s]  about because if it actually happens it's going to be my favorite stream I've ever done in my
[16097.13s -> 16102.46s]  whole life. Nothing will ever compare. Ever. If I can get it to work. I don't know if I can.
[16102.46s -> 16105.69s]  I don't want to build excitement for it but it'll be it'll be the best thing.
[16105.69s -> 16112.63s]  Nothing will ever compare. It'll be better than dollhouse. At least from me it will.
[16112.63s -> 16122.22s]  From me it will. Okay wait wait wait. I actually think I'm just going to use this here.
[16122.22s -> 16146.68s]  Egomaniac thinks about himself only. Not always. Maybe leak in two years. Okay so let's go. I need
[16146.68s -> 16165.69s]  something to kill that. Five two. Exactly what I wanted. Okay this will kill that now. Dude what
[16165.69s -> 16205.96s]  the hell's going on? How am I? Break this fucking thing please. This is okay. Elk with flight.
[16205.96s -> 16220.74s]  Throw us the fart video. I will. I will show it to you. One of these days. I'll show it to you.
[16222.60s -> 16290.98s]  I will. One two. I mean this whatever. Ow. This thing's stupid. What does this do?
[16293.06s -> 16307.62s]  I don't want this boulder. Sucks. Two four. I'm going to replace you here I think. Yeah then
[16307.62s -> 16323.62s]  I'll save the rest for now. Go ahead and knock this all out. Out of the face. I think I'm
[16323.62s -> 16342.06s]  still fine. I have a bunch of squirrels already. There we are. Okay just kill this stuff. All right
[16342.78s -> 16357.37s]  I need. Ackrat will kill this and then I can do cockroach. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.
[16357.37s -> 16386.49s]  Two. Mile please. Ah it hurts to do that. Um cockroaches what is it just dies
[16386.49s -> 16392.41s]  whenever you play it or something. So I gotta just put this out. I could do squirrel. I'm kind
[16392.41s -> 16410.09s]  of in trouble. What does this do again? Ackrat or should I do this? Ackrat. I just have to not die.
[16412.26s -> 16452.38s]  Fake fuck Andy? What? What are you talking about? What is this? Oh bones. Fake fuck Andy. Thank you.
[16459.58s -> 16507.66s]  Boss time man. It is. Get out there. Thank you. I almost lost. When will the fart leak? I don't
[16507.66s -> 16523.93s]  know. Maybe. I don't know. Maybe like. I don't know. Maybe somebody's birthday. Always. I like
[16523.93s -> 16539.83s]  this game a lot. What is this? Did I do this one yet? Whose birthday? That's for me to decide.
[16539.83s -> 16551.83s]  I was the pelt one. Okay. Orbs maggots? The creature that you own perishes by combat. A
[16551.83s -> 16568.25s]  carb bearing is automatically played in its place. Another wolf would be good. Or uh mantis. I feel
[16568.25s -> 16579.06s]  like I don't have a lot of damage. Leak it if you lose your trial by combat community knight.
[16579.06s -> 16583.38s]  The Ludwig. No because the people that get picked will just throw so they get to see like the
[16583.38s -> 16598.39s]  leaked fart video. I'm gonna do the wolf. I need damage. I need like more than. Everything I have
[16598.39s -> 16612.10s]  is like one. Leak it if you win. Maybe I'll leak a screenshot of I win maybe. I'm not gonna. I'm.
[16612.10s -> 16618.58s]  It's a video. Yeah. I told you. I'm lying in a bed. Aiming it up like this. Like the camera's
[16618.58s -> 16624.04s]  facing this way and I make it so I'm like filling the whole frame. I look huge. I don't know why
[16624.04s -> 16645.05s]  I was doing it. It's fucking horrible. All right we're going uh. I don't want to do the kick.
[16645.05s -> 16668.41s]  Atrioc. Big A. Welcome everybody. I'm playing uh inscription. Thanks for the raid. Hope you had a
[16668.41s -> 16673.90s]  good stream Atrioc. I'm doing really well in this card game. I've gotten past the second boss. I've
[16673.90s -> 16679.59s]  gotten to the third area. Almost at the end of the game. I'm doing very well. No one said anything
[16679.59s -> 16696.23s]  uh about how poorly I'm playing the game. Another raid? There's not two raids in a row right?
[16696.23s -> 16709.34s]  No. Okay well that's. There's a lot of. There's like two three raids today. Thank you. Appreciate
[16709.34s -> 16715.00s]  it. Well let's go. We're playing inscription. I can't say I'm gonna be live for that much longer.
[16715.00s -> 16722.81s]  Maybe like when I get to the end of this run. All right let's go. You don't know how to play
[16722.81s -> 16728.17s]  inscription. Um neither do I. So I can't really explain it to you because I'm not the person to
[16728.17s -> 16745.58s]  ask. All right uh I'm doing gecko over here on the right. And let's go. What should I do now?
[16745.58s -> 16757.46s]  All right I got squirrel. This is gonna be perfect. Squirrel squirrel. Bang bang. Hold on a minute
[16757.46s -> 16779.75s]  though. I'm not gonna kill that. Might be Dumbo. I don't know whatever. I'm just going for the win
[16779.75s -> 16814.76s]  as fast as I can. Remember is there a penalty? For what? Dr. Oldker raid? No way. That's crazy.
[16814.76s -> 16822.78s]  Dr. Oldker's been dead since like 1850. That's really crazy. I can't believe he's raiding.
[16822.78s -> 16847.24s]  He's here right now? Holy crap. Uh I don't want to kill. Give me another pack wrap. Pack wrap. Pack
[16847.24s -> 16867.96s]  wrap. Pack wrap. Pack wrap. Did you hear about Joel's shit talking? Dr. Dr. Oldker's pizza?
[16867.96s -> 16878.30s]  No right? That's gotta be it. That's gotta be fake right? No no no. He would never. What do you
[16878.30s -> 16921.64s]  know? No way. That's fake news. Hold on give me one second. Just typing. It's in mod chat.
[16928.23s -> 16939.67s]  All right squirrel uh putting the gecko out obviously. Obviously. Will this kill me if I
[16939.67s -> 16950.78s]  put it here? All right if I put this here it's gonna be the next turn I'm done right? If I put
[16950.78s -> 16959.37s]  the the gecko there it will die next turn right? Oh they said they all have flying. Okay all right
[16959.37s -> 17001.02s]  well then I'm putting it here. Let's go by the way. Yes. No Lois is bad. Raids. Raids. Raids. Yeah a
[17001.02s -> 17016.14s]  lot of raids. Did I just lose? What the fuck is that? I actually just lost. What just happened? I
[17016.14s -> 17028.78s]  just threw. I'm not in my element. I'm not sitting on a toilet or lying on my back in bed at four
[17028.78s -> 17036.09s]  o'clock in the morning. I'm not in my element right now with a game like this. I am gonna take this
[17036.09s -> 17052.90s]  because I feel like everything's dying so quickly I need something to take hits. Power. All right
[17052.90s -> 17064.70s]  what do I want? All right pack rat. I love using the pack rat so I'm gonna or the yeah gecko too.
[17064.70s -> 17076.49s]  Yeah always. Always. He has to. No I'm just saying I'm usually I'm in my element more when I'm
[17076.49s -> 17089.53s]  lying on my back like this. Okay taunted wolf is actually really good. Okay so now I'm gonna go
[17089.53s -> 17105.53s]  this way. Let's go. These are gross sex jokes? What are you talking about? When do they make a sex
[17105.53s -> 17138.78s]  joke? What do you mean? When did I do that? I didn't do that. These are gross sex jokes. Dude no. All
[17138.78s -> 17149.32s]  right I do this IRL. I do that all the time. I don't have to do it now. What do I have for items?
[17149.32s -> 17172.90s]  Okay I'm gonna use the cat bone thing over here. Your adversary will entirely skip their next turn.
[17172.90s -> 17206.42s]  Yeah fuck you. B is free right? Yep. Now can I at least kill the the fisherman again? Why are you
[17206.42s -> 17211.86s]  so dirty today? I'm not dirty ever. I just look dirty because this thing is the sun is shining on
[17211.86s -> 17228.18s]  my face. It's right there and it's just glistening off all the face oil that I have. Do the same. I
[17228.18s -> 17243.21s]  do. All right it's 11 a.m here. Yeah we're not gonna go much longer. This is my last run and then again
[17243.21s -> 17250.18s]  tomorrow don't forget write it down if you have to. Tomorrow is Elden Ring PvP community tryout
[17250.18s -> 17256.18s]  night to see who has what it takes to take on Ludwig's community in the community champion night
[17256.18s -> 17260.74s]  when I decide who's gonna be my community champion or the stream where we fight each other.
[17262.58s -> 17272.76s]  Sorry. All right I'm not fucking this one up. This is it. I keep messing this one up and I'm
[17272.76s -> 17306.23s]  an idiot for doing it. Yes it does. I'm gonna save this. Okay let's go. It's fine.
[17309.80s -> 17331.93s]  Then okay don't screw this up. I already did didn't I? No I didn't because now I play this pelt.
[17331.93s -> 17349.24s]  Take pelt and then good. Close the pelt. All right and then I play stink bug here right off the bat.
[17349.24s -> 17360.49s]  All right good nice top deck. It actually uh for real you're right. There we go. We go here. All
[17360.49s -> 17391.96s]  right let's do it. That's round one right? One more. Yeah that's it. That's it. Round two. Go fish.
[17391.96s -> 17400.12s]  This is the part that sucks. Huge. Very very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good.
[17400.12s -> 17430.74s]  Actual awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Do it. Oh stabbed my arm. Oh fuck. I'm in. Did I have
[17430.74s -> 17436.62s]  the knife? I forgot. Do I even have the knife? It was oh my god. I forgot it even existed.
[17442.49s -> 17466.14s]  I forgot it. It was like blending in and hiding back here. Give me this fucking thing. No fuck.
[17470.18s -> 17494.28s]  What do I do? Um I have to do it and then I can put this section might be okay. So if I do that's
[17494.28s -> 17502.57s]  four five six seven. I think that's a win right there. Yeah that's a win. I got it. Thank god.
[17503.13s -> 17531.30s]  I almost just blew it. My god man. I seriously almost blew it. I just whatever. Long elk amoeba
[17531.30s -> 17548.74s]  or two. What is long elk? Weird. I like this one. Three three two. Safe. Please replace the eye.
[17555.56s -> 17568.66s]  This one. Take the glowy one. Does it matter? I thought that was just like a funny little thing.
[17568.66s -> 17583.58s]  Did that matter? The eyes matter. I didn't know that. All right can I get to the at least past
[17583.58s -> 17595.75s]  the third boss or add to the third boss? Didn't I pick it before? I thought I already clicked it.
[17595.75s -> 17635.58s]  Whoa expensive though. It just can die. It's just kind of like tanky. Well let's go get the item.
[17635.58s -> 17649.38s]  Another knife. Knife is really helpful. I mean this was awesome too. I'm picking up. And I guess
[17649.38s -> 17667.43s]  I'm a fan. Pretty good items. Not bad. Okay you have flight. I just hit this. Echo always goes out
[17667.43s -> 17676.74s]  always no matter what. This is zero four so that's fine. Keep you here. And I got stunted wolf too.
[17676.74s -> 17690.22s]  Stunted wolf will. Maybe I just have stunted wolf kill this. Just be hitting this. Of course I have
[17690.22s -> 17708.86s]  him over here. Eventually it'll kill that. Yeah. Oh it's gonna fly over you. Okay cool.
[17709.10s -> 17753.80s]  I'm just gonna pass. Um I think I just lost. Did I just lose? Did I? If I take the knife and then
[17753.80s -> 17771.53s]  pack rat before kill. No I have to sacrifice this. Don't use items. I have lives. Yeah. Could I have
[17771.53s -> 17782.18s]  played that better? I feel like I did everything correct. Wolf will kill the bird. Yeah I'm just
[17782.18s -> 17803.34s]  gonna pass again. Then I guess I should. Am I okay? I think I'm okay. Am I dead? Not yet. This is.
[17803.34s -> 17811.00s]  All right yeah I'm fine. I'm kind of scared there. I need to use something. I'm gonna try to use the
[17811.00s -> 17819.24s]  knife. This pack rat's gonna come out and it's gonna be wasted. Use the fan instead of the knife.
[17819.24s -> 17859.62s]  Okay and this pack rat in here. That will kill that. That will. I think that yeah that's it. He
[17859.62s -> 17868.28s]  wasted the fan. I can't. I just want to replace it. I don't like these. They're too hard. I'm going
[17868.28s -> 17897.37s]  this way. I'll take a two. What's this do again? This deletes one and gives me um. What's this do?
[17897.37s -> 17919.64s]  I'm deleting Lois. This card's awful. This card's awful. I'm getting there a little bit longer.
[17919.64s -> 17940.54s]  See if I can at least get to the boss. I'll be happy. I mean put the geck over here. That's all
[17940.54s -> 17963.03s]  I can really do right now. Is your face cam too small? All right that's gonna be. All right so
[17963.03s -> 17987.62s]  I'm gonna rip a tooth out and then pack rat and then kill this fucking thing. Oy! Oh that's it.
[17987.62s -> 18018.76s]  Oh my goodness. I'm so. I was trying to be so confidently correct but I don't know. Whatever.
[18023.91s -> 18044.30s]  ADHD brain. Yeah dude check this out. Okay this is gonna be like a 6-6. This thing is gonna be
[18044.30s -> 18059.66s]  insane. Get me up there. All right don't quit absolutely squirt. Just quit squirring around.
[18059.66s -> 18067.82s]  I've got it. It's a 6-6. I gotta take this shit out now. I don't care about the fawn. I got the
[18067.82s -> 18078.10s]  rabbit. So we're gonna go squirrel. The rabbit does. Whenever this is played I get a rabbit in
[18078.10s -> 18112.94s]  my hand. So we're gonna. Oh eat shit. I win. I'm not gonna use this yet. I just beat him one turn.
[18112.94s -> 18136.15s]  Raven. Okay let's make pack rat even better. If I get pack rat flight I could win games in one
[18136.15s -> 18157.85s]  turn. That's what I'm doing. But I have to get rid of the raven. I just got it. I'll go for it.
[18157.85s -> 18171.37s]  This is a 6-6 flying pack rat. See if it helps. I feel like it's gonna be all right. I'm at the
[18171.37s -> 18184.50s]  boss. The man stood before you. A man you recognize immediately. It was the trapper. He reached out
[18184.50s -> 18202.36s]  to examine his wares but he stopped you. All right but today you will supply the pelts. So this okay
[18202.36s -> 18207.37s]  it's just crap. When a card bearing the sigil perishes the creature opposing it perishes as
[18207.37s -> 18215.62s]  well. You don't want to kill that. Like you want some shitty thing to kill that. All right there it
[18215.62s -> 18236.22s]  is. There it is. So I want to use the rabbit and then I'll get. I got another raid. Criken coming in
[18236.22s -> 18248.58s]  with a raid. I got this with so many raids. What's going on? Thanks Criken. Welcome everybody.
[18248.58s -> 18258.12s]  Playing um inscription and I'm about to beat the guy in one turn because now I can do this.
[18258.12s -> 18277.96s]  I'm gonna kill him in one turn. Okay now what? I'm gonna beat him in one second.
[18277.96s -> 18289.99s]  Cycle must continue. Let's trade. Powerful cards. I will accept only the finest pelts for them.
[18290.07s -> 18298.79s]  Okay. Great for what you can but know this. The rest will stay and fight for me. That's fine. I'm
[18298.79s -> 18312.46s]  just gonna fly over you and kill you in one hit. So I have to pick a card. Please read. Take the
[18312.46s -> 18330.02s]  wolf. Take his big health cards. Like the grizzly. I still win. No I still win. Take the bloodhound.
[18330.02s -> 18345.54s]  Oh that blocks me. You're right. Okay who else do I want? And the grizzly. Or the raven. Yep raven.
[18345.54s -> 18358.97s]  Raven. Okay I kill him in one hit. I'm done. Yeah I win. Goodbye. Just end turn. It's over.
[18359.05s -> 18380.70s]  Come on. I didn't do anything. Need a light? GG. And you know I'm taking another pack rat. You
[18380.70s -> 18391.93s]  understand? I'm gonna upgrade it again. You can see a light in the distance. The end is near.
[18391.93s -> 18424.46s]  Let me see. Please pay attention. All right. What do I want to do here? What's better? Probably the
[18424.46s -> 18437.82s]  merge one. Wait is this the merge one? No it's not. It's pelts. I'm so nervous. All right. Who's going
[18437.82s -> 18472.70s]  in here? Who should I put in there? Pack rat? Buff the rat. Maybe one of these? Or the stinky one?
[18472.70s -> 18476.14s]  Oh no no no no no. Yep that's an amazing thing I'm gonna do right now.
[18476.78s -> 18488.38s]  Gecko. Holy shit this is huge. Absolutely unbelievably unequivocally, equivocally huge.
[18488.38s -> 18494.73s]  So this I'm at the I'm at the I can fight this thing? I'm at the boss? Your eyes have fixed
[18494.73s -> 18499.93s]  themselves in the small cabin. It's warm light a beacon in the oppressive darkness of the night.
[18499.93s -> 18525.05s]  Surely surely this cabin marked the end of your travels. You guys gonna have to help me. Just get
[18525.05s -> 18535.93s]  the fuck out of me. I like knew something might have happened too. You're presented with an
[18535.93s -> 18542.06s]  opportunity. I don't offer my boons to just any traveler. If you're able to pass my trials you
[18542.06s -> 18550.71s]  will be rewarded mightily. Trial of the swift. Redrawn cards must include a card with the
[18551.35s -> 18572.79s]  sprinter, waterborne, or they must be rare. Yeah I don't think I have. It's definitely this one.
[18572.79s -> 18584.66s]  One two three. Ah pack rat is a rare card. Success. I will grant you one of my most powerful boons.
[18584.66s -> 18588.89s]  Cards that dramatically alter the game and you don't even need to draw them.
[18590.81s -> 18597.70s]  Boon of the bone lord. You will start a battle with eight bones. Boon of the ambidextrous. You
[18597.70s -> 18603.51s]  may draw twice at the beginning of your turn. Boon of the forest. You will start a battle with grand
[18604.50s -> 18616.07s]  urs on all your spaces. I feel like draw twice is just like that's a I don't know if anything
[18617.69s -> 18621.05s]  these are the tanky things that stay in front and this is a shitload of bones. I'm taking this one
[18622.07s -> 18630.94s]  and draw twice. We will repeat that once more. The trial of skins. The three drawn cards must
[18630.94s -> 18641.05s]  include a pelt card. No. Airborne. I have a few of those. If you have a ring you pass automatically.
[18641.05s -> 18651.88s]  Look at the table. 11 o'clock. What does that mean? 11. I don't think do I I don't have a ring.
[18651.88s -> 18680.71s]  I'm gonna it has to be airborne. What's he doing? You managed to get a boon. This may be a fair
[18680.71s -> 18704.42s]  competition. He's gonna scream at me. I'm ready. What the fuck? You took your time out there.
[18704.42s -> 18722.87s]  And I'm itching for another game. Are you ready to play? I hope you are all adequately prepared.
[18722.87s -> 18753.94s]  Perhaps one more to be safe. That's not fair. Shit. What do you got? Okay mole man. Okay I can do
[18758.92s -> 18783.30s]  whorl smoke right here right? Put stow down on the right because then it'll be one no. I don't want
[18783.30s -> 18792.23s]  to screw this up because that will hit. That should be correct. I think that's correct. And then should
[18792.23s -> 18798.38s]  I put the smoke pelt out just to get the bones and get it hit? I wonder where the bones should go.
[18798.38s -> 18819.08s]  All the way to the next door? Plug the lane with the pelt. Save it. Okay all right let's go. Okay
[18819.08s -> 18825.00s]  I'm like nervous. I'm gonna I feel like I'm gonna look like an idiot. Okay I have a rat king which
[18825.00s -> 18830.07s]  gives me bones. I have a lot of bone things but I don't know what this is gonna hit three times.
[18830.07s -> 18840.34s]  So we have to go like this. Draw. I can draw twice. Two squirrels and then go straight up here.
[18840.34s -> 18855.50s]  I have items too. Yeah nice. All right I don't want to get hit three times here. So I'm gonna go
[18856.94s -> 18867.05s]  squirrel, stunted wolf right down uh main street here. Wolf pelt here, smoke here. Got it? Oh my god
[18867.05s -> 18872.18s]  I have this thing. All right this is going all the way to the left. This is going all the way to the
[18872.18s -> 18889.38s]  left. It's gonna tank this damage. That's what I'm doing. And then the smoke is gonna go here um right.
[18889.38s -> 18908.68s]  Okay so let's do this and then pelt here. Let's go. Yeah let's go. What the fuck is he doing?
[18908.68s -> 18912.12s]  What is happening right now? Why is he doing this? I didn't what's he doing this? What the
[18912.12s -> 18918.89s]  fuck is going on? He didn't take another zero. What the hell just happened? Did he do that before
[18918.89s -> 18927.06s]  every turn? Oh my god it's over. Oh he's putting on the different masks.
[18931.26s -> 18948.74s]  That's not good. It's really bad. It's not over. Okay I think I just have to pass right? Or should
[18948.74s -> 18960.26s]  I put the squirrel down to not? I have to pass I think. Should I use the knife right now?
[18960.26s -> 18999.14s]  Or just block him with the smoke? God. Oh okay I have to frog. I have to knife. Knife hourglass.
[18999.14s -> 19028.71s]  Should I put the amalgam? Knife hourglass? Knife hourglass amalgam. Card cut. Oh I thought it was
[19028.71s -> 19035.96s]  a stab. Okay so I obviously want to kill the amalgam right? Or should I kill? This is going
[19035.96s -> 19051.66s]  to be three damage regardless right? Like this? Let him hook the squirrel. I know my health is
[19051.66s -> 19062.02s]  just I'm dead. What should I get rid of? This one here? The amalgam put bullcrab onto mantis god.
[19062.84s -> 19083.62s]  Yeah that's the play. I have another squirrel too. Dead man. Bullfrog. Oh but wait! Hourglass
[19083.62s -> 19090.30s]  hourglass hourglass. Alright I can do it. I can hourglass. Now you can't do shit? Now?
[19091.10s -> 19099.43s]  Um does that mean he won't do that? So now if I put the pelt down in front of this
[19100.15s -> 19112.54s]  will he still? Okay he will not hook right? Pelt down here. Squirrel. Um use the pelt here right?
[19112.54s -> 19116.82s]  Yeah. Stop reading chat. Dude I'm telling you I'm gonna fuck this whole thing up if I don't.
