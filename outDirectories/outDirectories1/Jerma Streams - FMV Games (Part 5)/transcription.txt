[5.88s -> 15.03s]  I told you guys I was gonna be early. I told you. I mean I'm only five minutes early but I'm still
[15.03s -> 34.54s]  early. Still counts. Still does. How you doing? Are we doing good? I gotta tweet this. Today
[35.26s -> 47.72s]  we're gonna play some FMV games. One just came out that piqued my interest. If we're gonna play
[47.72s -> 58.57s]  the first one is not late. No, I'm not late. I'm precisely on time. The first one's called
[58.57s -> 72.71s]  American Hero and apparently this game is like 25 years old and it was never released. So some
[72.71s -> 78.86s]  company, I guess they like got 90% of the way through development and they just didn't finish
[78.86s -> 86.12s]  the game. So some random indie company, I don't know what the name of the company is. I kind of
[86.12s -> 96.06s]  forget. Got all the footage and actually released it. So this is a very old game. I'm very interested
[96.06s -> 107.05s]  in this one. You're a hipster king. Well, not really. This thing's on the Nintendo Switch right
[107.05s -> 118.17s]  now. So not really. I didn't like go get this on some secret place. You can literally get this on
[118.17s -> 132.04s]  Switch right now. What about Monster Breeder? It's possible we play Monster Breeder later today.
[132.89s -> 137.70s]  It really depends on how long these take. Because with some FMV games, some of these games are
[139.21s -> 144.14s]  40 minutes. Some of them are three hours. It really depends on how many. Maybe if we play
[144.14s -> 150.38s]  through it again, if we move on to the next one, I don't know. It depends. We'll see.
[151.02s -> 165.10s]  You can play among us. It's never gonna happen. It's gonna be awful or bad.
[168.14s -> 176.01s]  Is that what you said? Did I read that wrong? This is gonna be awful or bad. What about the
[176.01s -> 181.69s]  Goosebumps FMV with Jeff Goldblum? I did not even know that existed. But now that I know that
[181.69s -> 188.86s]  exists, I'm very interested. I'm like an FMV wine connoisseur. It doesn't matter how bad they are.
[188.86s -> 201.54s]  It doesn't matter how shitty they are. I have to play them. All of them. If I can. Also, I want to
[201.54s -> 207.56s]  make this really clear. There was a content warning on this game. Apparently it's pretty dated.
[209.00s -> 213.00s]  I don't know exactly what that means. But like I said, it's on the Switch.
[214.33s -> 224.06s]  I don't know how... I don't exactly know what to be looking for. But we'll be on the ready.
[224.70s -> 241.05s]  Are you gonna stream bad mojo? Probably not. So if we do come across something that's
[241.05s -> 247.99s]  fucking shitty and bad, you know, you fucking behave yourselves. Come on. Come on, Gwen.
[247.99s -> 264.98s]  You know what I mean? Are you gonna stream crab game? No, I don't. No. No, I don't.
[265.94s -> 275.29s]  Every one of these games it takes off, I don't play them. I watch. Okay. With like trends on
[275.29s -> 281.29s]  Twitch, it's kind of like how a lot of people jump into like the stock market and stuff.
[282.25s -> 286.49s]  It's like a game will come along and I'll go, that looks kind of cool. I would like to maybe
[286.49s -> 291.93s]  try that out. That looks like a great experience. And then I don't play it. And then two or three
[292.09s -> 298.25s]  weeks later, it's incredibly popular and everyone's on it. Oh, that's awesome. I
[298.25s -> 301.61s]  probably should have... Maybe I could get in now. I don't think I'm gonna get it. I, you know,
[301.61s -> 306.25s]  maybe. It looks fun. Now it's like the biggest thing on Twitch, the biggest thing in the world.
[307.13s -> 315.75s]  I don't want to buy the top of the crab game meta. You know what I mean? Stop calling me a hipster.
[315.75s -> 328.44s]  Why are you saying that? Why don't you stream McDonald's hamburger adventure? I don't even
[328.44s -> 338.36s]  know what you're talking about. All right. You guys ready? Apparently, this is something else
[338.36s -> 345.21s]  I read about this too, is the actor that's in this, they had to have him re-record lines
[346.57s -> 353.48s]  with the restoration. And I mean, the guy's like almost 25 plus years older than he is.
[354.28s -> 357.08s]  So I don't know how that's going to play out, but it might be pretty funny.
[362.58s -> 371.08s]  But this is American hero. I am ready. Our choices matter, apparently. Are you going to
[371.08s -> 377.75s]  play Fortnite or should I just go? You liar. You're a, how many months up? You're a six-month
[377.75s -> 383.88s]  subscriber. You've been here for six months. You know what happens on this channel. You're a liar.
[383.88s -> 396.46s]  You're lying to everybody. All right. You ready? Let's go. This is American hero. Viewer discretion
[396.46s -> 409.18s]  is advised apparently. And let's go. You ready? Oh, by the way, very important. That's the guy
[409.18s -> 416.09s]  from, that's my Bush from comedy central. Yeah. I don't know if anyone remembers that show.
[422.92s -> 431.16s]  That was a really weird reference, but here we go. American hero. Yeah. Okay. Well,
[431.88s -> 440.55s]  there's right off the bat, right off the bat. I hope there's, uh, I don't think, I don't think
[440.55s -> 454.60s]  there's any nudity. I hope not. No, there's not. Oh God. My home away from home. It's, I,
[455.40s -> 461.19s]  Crystal's looking good today. I think that's the, I think that's the voiceover. I think that's a new
[461.19s -> 468.49s]  line. You got something against me making a lemon. Relax. Just care. Asshole. There is nudity. No,
[468.49s -> 474.01s]  there's not. It's on the switch. It can't be. It's on the Nintendo switch. It's impossible.
[474.65s -> 478.33s]  They don't allow any nudity on the switch. That's a lie. It can't be possible.
[483.18s -> 493.11s]  Here's trouble. They were right. Now you can piss off. Sergeant. It's Colonel. BFD.
[493.99s -> 501.03s]  The old man has a problem. Why does it sound like he's in a bathroom? Not interested. It involves
[501.03s -> 512.49s]  Laura and a dangerous mind control virus. Dangerous. Okay. I think she's been kidnapped. Can't say more.
[512.49s -> 516.25s]  It looks like borderlands characters. What's the, what's the, it looks weird. Why are you interested?
[516.89s -> 525.45s]  Meet me somewhere a little more private. You're a big fucking dork. All right. Let me pay attention
[525.45s -> 534.92s]  to the game. A rock in a hard place. I have to make a decision here. What do I want to do?
[536.22s -> 544.70s]  Bad news. Bad news. Or party. What? Bad news. What's going on? What'd I do?
[551.66s -> 561.75s]  Did he leave? Oh shit. Am I going to get run over by a car? Why is there a truck?
[562.63s -> 583.13s]  Do I have to move the QTE? What do I do? What do I do? A ledge. Run. A ledge. Run. A ledge. Run. Run.
[591.62s -> 596.26s]  Jump. Jump. I'm going to jump. I'm going to drop. I'm going to drop. He's going to get run over.
[601.30s -> 606.04s]  New item unlocked? Oh shit.
[620.73s -> 631.66s]  Wait. Hold on a second. Hold on. So I was in a strip club and then I was either going to go do
[631.66s -> 635.50s]  this mission or stay in the strip club. And then he left the strip club. Started running away from
[637.08s -> 643.94s]  a, somebody in a Mack truck that ran my whole body over lengthwise, which is
[644.02s -> 650.89s]  fucking crazy. I got steamrolled. Okay. All right. No, Jesus. We have to do this again.
[650.89s -> 657.45s]  I don't want to have to show this again. I, all right. What should I do? Should I?
[658.09s -> 662.49s]  I'm going to go get the bad news. I'm not clicking party on a game that has been confirmed to have
[662.49s -> 673.43s]  nudity in it. No way. Not going to happen. Nope. Not happening. My home away from home.
[673.43s -> 677.67s]  I could run over lengthwise. That's fucking it ran over from my heels looking good today
[677.67s -> 680.86s]  to the top of my head. That was insane.
[688.60s -> 695.02s]  I missed that last time as well. He's drinking carrot juice. I don't get it.
[699.75s -> 701.11s]  I don't believe there's nudity on the switch.
[703.29s -> 713.21s]  Here's trouble. They were right. So now you can piss off. Oh, there's not. It's Colonel B F D.
[714.09s -> 721.53s]  The old man has a problem. I'm not clicking party. Not interested. It involves Laura
[722.17s -> 734.66s]  and a dangerous mind control virus. I didn't mean to click that. I think she's been kidnapped.
[734.66s -> 741.53s]  Can't say more upscaled with AI. If you're interested, meet me somewhere a little more.
[741.53s -> 744.97s]  It does actually, I'm actually kind of glad it looks like this because some of the old FMV
[744.97s -> 749.53s]  games we played in the past, they look like absolute dog shit. So this doesn't really even
[749.53s -> 756.25s]  look that bad. All right. No, no party. No, I have to get this right. It's like a rhythm game.
[757.86s -> 769.40s]  Bad news. Bad news. Bad news. Bad news. I clicked bad news. I clicked bad news. I don't want to
[769.40s -> 775.40s]  run away from the fucking truck. I clicked bad news. I clicked.
[775.40s -> 781.06s]  I clicked. What's the fuck? No, I'm how do I skip the cut scene?
[784.25s -> 790.09s]  I'm not going to get run over again. The truck is bad news. Oh, no it's not. I didn't do anything
[790.09s -> 797.00s]  last time. All right. All right. This time don't drop. This time I'm going to, I'm going to go
[797.00s -> 808.31s]  for the ledge. Ledge. Ledge. Run. Ledge. Run. Ledge. Ledge. Ledge. Run. Is he doing it?
[808.95s -> 818.23s]  What? He's not making decisions. What the fuck? Drop. Jump. Drop. I can't do anything. Drop. Do
[818.23s -> 836.60s]  you hear me clicking? Do you hear this? What? Why doesn't the game work? Mouse one. I'm clicking
[836.60s -> 851.69s]  mouse one. Oh, this is not good. It's not right click. It's left click, right? Maybe I should
[851.69s -> 858.97s]  unplug the controller. I don't think I have one unplugged in. I mean the mouse apps. Yeah,
[858.97s -> 865.10s]  that's left click. I don't think, no, there's no controller plugged in. It's just my mouse.
[867.77s -> 879.13s]  I was spamming too. 10 second reaction time. Try right clicking. Hold on. Options.
[879.93s -> 890.18s]  Dirty full screen. Set keys. Set. Okay. Select. Left click, right? Yeah. Action. Space.
[891.46s -> 905.86s]  Better be pressing. Well, why would it say left click? I guess I'm going to try to hit space.
[906.66s -> 917.51s]  It's also up, down, left, right as well. Well, I'll try space. God damn it. All right. I'll try
[917.51s -> 923.51s]  space. You better believe I'm going to try to make sure this, get this to work. You don't get
[923.51s -> 927.59s]  run over lengthwise by a car like that and not like play out at least some of the game. Are you
[927.59s -> 936.14s]  kidding me? No way. All right. Let me see what happens. The tutorial doesn't give you, it just
[936.14s -> 941.50s]  tells you, um, like the gist of the game. I read it already. All right. Can I skip this cut scene?
[942.22s -> 948.84s]  How do you skip cut scene? Escape. That's definitely a way to do it. Enter.
[949.56s -> 962.78s]  It's tab. I mean, it's tab works. My home away from home. Right click. No, this is definitely
[962.78s -> 975.32s]  a way to do it. Looking good today. I'm going to see if space works. Pinhead. Why are you making
[975.32s -> 981.70s]  us watch this? I'm not making you watch this again. I'm trying the game's controls are not accurate.
[990.62s -> 1000.55s]  Here's trouble. They were right. So now you can piss off sergeant. It's colonel. D F D.
[1001.43s -> 1008.63s]  The old man has a problem. He needs your help. Not interested. Bad news space. It involves law.
[1008.63s -> 1015.75s]  It doesn't work that I don't know what I'm going to do. It's not the game. Oh, should I like,
[1015.75s -> 1019.75s]  should I plug it to controller in? I think she's been kidnapped. Can't say more.
[1021.10s -> 1026.06s]  Falls have ears. If you're interested, meet me somewhere a little more private.
[1026.46s -> 1044.17s]  And let's see. Base rock in a hard place. Come on, please work. Please work. Bad news. All right.
[1044.17s -> 1052.76s]  It's space. It's fucking space. What is that meter at the top? I knew you'd make the right
[1052.76s -> 1060.82s]  choice. Okay, Colonel, this better be good. I hope I still get run over by a fucking truck.
[1062.26s -> 1069.32s]  I'm sure Laura would be impressed. I'm not here on a social visit.
[1070.28s -> 1075.00s]  There's so many cigarettes. Kruger's escaped. It's up to his old tricks. Laura was working
[1075.00s -> 1081.32s]  for us. She developed an antivirus formula. They kidnapped her before she could get it to us.
[1081.32s -> 1087.32s]  Tell me about the virus. The old man will do that. What matters is you want Laura. We want the
[1087.32s -> 1095.56s]  antivirus formula. Okay. No, that's not, that's not Nick Cage. What do you think, Jack? Can you
[1095.56s -> 1105.61s]  get it up for another? Fuck you. Yes. Fuck you. Yes. Fuck you. Yes. What just happened? I just
[1105.61s -> 1117.75s]  blacked out. Why did I black out? What was the point of blacking out? Oh, it's censored.
[1117.75s -> 1123.75s]  Get it. Split. What? Lemo. Get it. Lemo. Split. Lemo. Get it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1123.75s -> 1128.17s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. It's the elasticity of the Switch. It's
[1128.17s -> 1132.95s]  all the Switch. It's on the Nintendo Switch. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen.
[1134.63s -> 1137.27s]  You should drink a big water. That's it. It's all Nintendo Switch now going to happen.
[1137.27s -> 1138.71s]  Things are looking up. No, they're not, no, they're not, they're
[1139.75s -> 1143.67s]  have to get out of this. It does three options. It's like, I'm playing a fucking Mario Party
[1143.67s -> 1147.75s]  game where I have to like hit the dice at the right time. Give me a break. That's weird.
[1147.75s -> 1154.66s]  I don't get out leave, leave, leave before I hit the escape button? Leave, run.

[2084.62s -> 2092.76s]  this time I'm gonna stay in the car it's a break in front of me just match

[2181.60s -> 2191.60s]  was not the right decisions probably break yeah yeah okay what if I hit gas
[2191.60s -> 2204.00s]  here's what the other option this game is having a nightmare it is gonna have
[2204.00s -> 2234.56s]  a nightmare it's break break is the right play we're gonna get the same
[2234.56s -> 2258.96s]  ending it's my lucky day you smoke gas this is outrageous is brave the way Jack
[2258.96s -> 2266.40s]  would watch it be ashes to ashes dust to dust what was the budget for this game I
[2266.40s -> 2269.60s]  don't know but the crazy story about this game is that you weren't here in
[2269.60s -> 2278.08s]  the very beginning this game was never released it it was done filming and I
[2278.08s -> 2280.36s]  don't know if they've ran the studio ran out of money or something but it was
[2280.36s -> 2284.94s]  never actually released a new company came in and kind of remastered all the
[2284.94s -> 2292.49s]  footage and restored it it's the only reason why we're playing it today okay
[2292.49s -> 2306.82s]  it's a break break all it's because it was in a Jaguar right and the console
[2306.94s -> 2327.01s]  we're not arguing about McDonald's or Wendy's we're talking about life and
[2327.01s -> 2347.16s]  death here I know we're gonna be great friends right yes there we go okay we're
[2347.16s -> 2362.61s]  good on to the next sequence what are you waiting for let's go okay what is
[2362.61s -> 2376.88s]  this pretty tight security this is the lab why would I just walk to the front
[2376.88s -> 2395.00s]  door like a fucking sim that's a neighbor what are you doing oh what are
[2395.00s -> 2410.34s]  you doing he was wearing a suit under all that holy shit he must be sweating

[2420.23s -> 2427.01s]  where's Laura everything in good time hey well I think I think I'm gonna try
[2427.01s -> 2433.88s]  to like melt me into the into the chemical that has one fatal design can
[2433.88s -> 2445.07s]  you guess what that is Russia Los Angeles is built on near desert what
[2445.07s -> 2461.00s]  try another 10 CC oh if someone were to say for instance here that was a fake
[2461.00s -> 2467.12s]  hand sitting there was a rubber hand I will release my virus into the system
[2467.12s -> 2475.81s]  within minutes the disease will ripple out exponents it will be the greatest
[2475.81s -> 2482.62s]  biological conquest of all boys in the waters I no longer have to remove this
[2482.62s -> 2486.98s]  primitive but clever oh that's why they're drinking the water out of the
[2486.98s -> 2515.33s]  big bottles another failed attempt oh sadistic bastard I got ready to turn and
[2515.33s -> 2531.22s]  fight oh no I'm gonna get like tortured what information do I have anyways I'm
[2531.26s -> 2554.33s]  just like an agent that's Laura Jack it was a story recap so far I was in
[2554.33s -> 2558.45s]  retirement I came out of retirement to solve this madman poisoning the water
[2558.45s -> 2583.85s]  supply done already on my case what oh no they took away the light that bulb is
[2583.85s -> 2593.29s]  so expensive that's very okay we're gonna take the solution here quick okay
[2593.29s -> 2598.37s]  all right right right here pin the guard here the guard do the medical solid I'm
[2598.37s -> 2621.12s]  sick I have diarrhea what well something anti-virus formula has an air yeah yeah
[2621.12s -> 2628.36s]  he's gonna get crushed what would you open the door without like a weapon yeah
[2628.36s -> 2631.48s]  I was in the middle of pressing the squish button do what good what do you
[2631.48s -> 2636.60s]  want we're gonna help you with oh yeah they told me never to do one thing I
[2636.60s -> 2640.04s]  forget what it was I think it was don't ever open this fucking door when people
[2640.04s -> 2651.48s]  are in it that wasn't even cartoon logic that was like they had a whole scene and
[2651.48s -> 2654.88s]  like they had like that the scene they threw the whole scene away and they had
[2654.88s -> 2657.78s]  to get an extra to be that guy like there was like a full ten minutes of
[2657.78s -> 2667.00s]  dialogue there left right left that was a reshoot left right they had a whole
[2667.00s -> 2695.10s]  sequence with a guard oh shit they went left oh god oh here we go oh no don't
[2695.10s -> 2709.69s]  push her into the way sound effect if you type in punch sound effect on YouTube
[2709.69s -> 2717.76s]  right now that's the first that's exactly the first one I have not had a
[2717.76s -> 2722.73s]  decision to make they're just doing it on their own the AI is just picking
[2722.73s -> 2736.81s]  direction left right oh god left right right that'll do holy shit she's running
[2736.81s -> 2747.67s]  way faster than me and she's in heels that's crazy left right oh my god I've
[2747.67s -> 2767.76s]  no idea let's go left right was the same guy this guy again we're gonna okay
[2767.76s -> 2772.97s]  we're gonna see this guy again like that's the wrong way I think if you make
[2772.97s -> 2777.09s]  the wrong decision you go in the circle you see that guy every time we're gonna
[2777.09s -> 2801.46s]  see him again right left right right that'll do we're about to loop again is
[2801.46s -> 2830.84s]  that guy gonna get up again can I just shoot that guy left right not again all
[2830.84s -> 2836.02s]  right there's no way that guy comes back another time it's not possible you
[2836.02s -> 2840.82s]  understand it's not possible that guy's back he flew off of a balcony like 15
[2841.10s -> 2866.83s]  no way look I need to know right I have no that guy's still alive somebody's
[2866.83s -> 2875.05s]  watching these cameras just going oh he doesn't they don't know he's back again
[2875.05s -> 2897.05s]  no more running why is that you see single shots there's two there now okay
[2897.05s -> 2910.50s]  oh no we just we got an we got the end card shit no oh damn it all right well
[2910.50s -> 2930.58s]  we'll get it we'll get it this time oh auto bolt action Uzi hmm okay well this
[2930.58s -> 2934.50s]  is this game is insane I we have to get at least some kind of other ending and
[2934.50s -> 2946.33s]  having far too much fun to stop playing this let's go again
[2946.33s -> 2953.43s]  let's try a new route let's go wait unlockables find every way to end the
[2953.43s -> 2961.10s]  game at Jack's funeral reach all the endings where Jack survives act on the
[2961.10s -> 2966.39s]  flatline like a pancake by 18 wheels of steel oh these are all the choices all
[2966.39s -> 2977.50s]  right let's go oh we can start from here sadistic bastard what wait what what
[2977.50s -> 2979.74s]  happened where's Laura this didn't happen
[2979.74s -> 3005.84s]  shoot me and you'll never see this didn't kill him later you still have the
[3005.84s -> 3015.65s]  gun shoot him in the face you have the gun still you still have
[3015.65s -> 3052.86s]  the gun all right I should just try start the whole thing over see if we can
[3052.86s -> 3059.62s]  get to the end from here well what I didn't do that before I didn't punch the
[3059.62s -> 3069.47s]  guy and grab the gun last time all right what do you think ones in the chat to
[3069.47s -> 3072.43s]  just go from that checkpoint and try it to keep going or two in the chat if you
[3072.43s -> 3082.56s]  want to start the game over and go different route that looks pretty that
[3082.56s -> 3089.18s]  looks pretty unanimously one all right let's go sadistic bastard okay so this
[3089.18s -> 3094.81s]  time I'm not gonna shoot grab the gun apparently where's Laura
[3094.81s -> 3106.06s]  shoot me and you'll never see okay don't shoot kill him later kill him later
[3106.06s -> 3121.06s]  later they still put him with a good dog so what I don't I just don't kill
[3121.06s -> 3134.18s]  care about having the weapon bar is a fight or flight meter yeah the more it's
[3134.18s -> 3138.97s]  on the right side it's aggression the more it's on the left running right we
[3138.97s -> 3141.53s]  have to do this again I need to play through this game one more time at least
[3141.53s -> 3151.50s]  it's too ridiculous not see everything else
[3152.90s -> 3160.58s]  try the hairpin
[3160.62s -> 3167.74s]  me and every other girl you bump into you overestimate how many past they shot
[3167.74s -> 3183.98s]  apparently a lot of footage all right let's try hairpin I'm sorry it's so loud
[3183.98s -> 3186.62s]  but it kind of has to be otherwise because there's no subtitles otherwise
[3186.62s -> 3205.32s]  you won't be able to hear anything I hope we get smush the guard
[3205.64s -> 3223.29s]  we're what are you what are you doing what are you doing what why in the name

[3838.41s -> 3843.31s]  bad one to have to redo it's been people walking around setting up the like five
[3843.31s -> 3856.11s]  straight minutes Kruger Hoover drum Kruger Hoover drums
[3856.15s -> 3873.42s]  shoot the red barrel nice job son who the fuck was that why am I looking behind

[3911.34s -> 3935.35s]  looking for this I don't know I've been infected we selling your body is gonna
[3935.35s -> 3940.59s]  mutate you're gonna be another one of dr. Kruger's mindless zombies a few
[3940.59s -> 3954.75s]  seconds you'll be my own personal can you say that again a plane drover ruined
[3954.75s -> 3978.90s]  your moment exothermic reaction is gonna multiply that virus all right three
[3978.90s -> 3989.34s]  minutes take it away didn't he say a few seconds that turned into a few
[3989.34s -> 4000.43s]  minutes is this the lose did I lose within three minutes Los Angeles will
[4000.43s -> 4013.97s]  be mine perhaps you might enjoy sharing easy you're gonna spell that shit so
[4013.97s -> 4023.42s]  what do I do Hoover Kruger Hoover Kruger what do I do Hoover Kruger I can't
[4023.62s -> 4069.65s]  shoot him from up here oh I hope the checkpoints really close I thought I
[4069.65s -> 4074.02s]  was gonna snipe him from all the way back there that would have been so
[4074.02s -> 4100.62s]  funny oh I was right at the checkpoint good very good yeah it's it's not I think
[4100.62s -> 4104.14s]  it's time for this guy to go back to the drawing board mojo Jojo tried this like
[4104.14s -> 4125.70s]  three times already I god damn it all right whatever it's all right it's all
[4125.70s -> 4130.22s]  right we have to watch this whole thing again all right this time I'm gonna who
[4130.22s -> 4138.81s]  should I shoot I point the gun at Hoover who should I point the gun at then not
[4138.81s -> 4142.25s]  the barrels right I thought the barrels is a great idea I'm gonna shoot the
[4142.25s -> 4145.89s]  barrel which is gonna destroy everything and everyone's gonna get the virus or
[4145.89s -> 4148.41s]  whatever all over them right that was like okay but then the guy just came
[4148.41s -> 4153.66s]  behind me the extra came behind me and hit me in the head so I was supposed to
[4153.66s -> 4158.20s]  know that was gonna happen it's gonna take it's gonna take oh god it's gonna
[4158.20s -> 4163.23s]  take forever yeah I'm gonna aim at Hoover that's a good idea
[4163.23s -> 4181.33s]  give it I don't I can't you can't get cutscenes I don't get down there I told
[4181.33s -> 4185.05s]  you to stay someplace safe you need to watch this every time I think we'll get
[4185.05s -> 4209.72s]  it this time skip no way not in a hundred million years let's go all right
[4209.72s -> 4214.20s]  we're gonna aim the gun at Hoover I feel like Hoover is gonna be like no no no
[4214.20s -> 4218.42s]  don't shoot me all right hold this is what's gonna happen don't shoot me this
[4218.42s -> 4223.82s]  guy's a snake right goodbye Hoover goodbye Krueger
[4223.82s -> 4244.30s]  very excited yeah I said the guy looks like Joe Biden no it looks like it looks
[4244.30s -> 4248.94s]  like somebody took young Joe Biden and put them in one of those agify apps to
[4248.94s -> 4276.22s]  make old Joe Biden that's what it looks like all right we got to aim at this guy
[4276.22s -> 4285.02s]  go after him I feel like we'll probably get another decision guns don't even
[4285.02s -> 4296.12s]  have barrels really bringing the crane well it gets the same message
[4304.08s -> 4311.04s]  don't screw this up I don't want to watch the first five minutes of every
[4311.04s -> 4333.68s]  RTS phase no I don't want to watch this don't have much time okay here we go

[4419.97s -> 4436.50s]  funny has to be a way to skip I really don't think there is it's space I don't
[4436.50s -> 4446.94s]  know I don't think it is yeah hey yeah this is very important to remember this
[4446.94s -> 4465.29s]  is 25 years old it's 25 years old how old are these actors now the craziest
[4465.29s -> 4473.89s]  part is the main character recorded voice lines with this remaster so how
[4473.89s -> 4478.69s]  old is the main character here probably in his I want to say probably the 40s
[4478.69s -> 4484.98s]  maybe early 40s probably so this this person the actor might actually be in
[4484.98s -> 4501.28s]  their late 60s into early 70s late 30s early 40s yeah that's another thing spam
[4501.28s -> 4510.60s]  every button no it doesn't do anything I'm telling you there is no skip he's
[4510.60s -> 4526.13s]  George Bush from that's my bush it was on Comedy Central he's almost as old as
[4526.13s -> 4540.12s]  you are now no I forgot about that's my bush yeah that was correct me if I'm
[4540.12s -> 4544.60s]  wrong but that was Trey Parker and Matt Stone made that show or at least Trey
[4544.60s -> 4550.52s]  Parker did South Park guys I think it was only live for like four episodes or
[4550.56s -> 4567.22s]  like six episodes goodbye Hoover goodbye Kruger here we go don't screw this up

[4588.34s -> 4600.20s]  not gonna miss him this time you said he's on the crane Bill Murray on the
[4600.20s -> 4607.28s]  crane so ready of over anticipating this I feel like it's not gonna be as funny
[4607.28s -> 4644.31s]  as you said it was okay where is he brain is the big moment that's not even
[4644.31s -> 4649.94s]  that's not even close it's his face is so pixelated in what this that's just a
[4649.94s -> 4653.82s]  guy that's just a guy with like Bill Murray hair actually hold on a minute
[4653.82s -> 4662.16s]  don't have much time that was actually pretty close that you okay here we go I

[4739.20s -> 4745.21s]  last time no I tried to shoot him from down here I grabbed his gun I tried to
[4745.21s -> 4752.98s]  aim up at him and he shot her in the head
[4752.98s -> 4764.47s]  with dr. Krueger's newest brain looking for this what you want

[4780.80s -> 4793.15s]  one of dr. Krueger's mindless on me yeah or like just touch a little bit of the
[4793.15s -> 4796.71s]  wetness and get it like in your mucus membranes just put your fingers in

[5003.58s -> 5007.82s]  zooming into it no this is horseshit you know why this is bullshit just think of
[5007.82s -> 5010.78s]  the other times where I've picked a decision where it was like oh go get
[5010.78s -> 5015.78s]  that guy and I just appeared tackling him that's happened like three times
[5015.78s -> 5020.64s]  guys there's been choices where he just had a gun in his pocket and he didn't
[5020.64s -> 5027.03s]  have it there before I think the game was showing me its hand
[5027.03s -> 5034.77s]  remember when I picked go for go to Hoover he fucking just was in mid tackle
[5034.77s -> 5049.12s]  after hiding behind a bush whatever the fuck was over there the game gaslit you
[5049.12s -> 5071.06s]  oh god damn it please tell me that no okay so to me fight would have been
[5071.06s -> 5080.22s]  stupid but oh grab the the plot device of the entire game but how am I gonna
[5080.22s -> 5085.38s]  fight a guy when I'm hanging from a ledge like that you don't plot device
[5085.38s -> 5104.21s]  plot device plot device plot device I've clicked the plot device put something
[5104.21s -> 5110.42s]  up distract us I have I have a really big apology here for you if I click out
[5110.42s -> 5117.59s]  of the window the game pauses and cannot play we have to work again this is gonna
[5117.59s -> 5123.43s]  be a bitch I can turn it down all right I turned it down we're gonna talk about
[5123.43s -> 5133.80s]  for like two minutes what should we talk about you need well you get to see bill
[5133.80s -> 5142.70s]  yeah you'll see bill Murray again that's cool that's pretty cool stuff what I
[5142.70s -> 5157.89s]  have a breakfast I had a coffee and then I had nothing else I don't eat it's hard
[5157.89s -> 5164.11s]  to eat breakfast when I get up in the morning and going all the way into the
[5164.11s -> 5170.16s]  early afternoon I can't eat anything thought of eating breakfast a lot of
[5170.16s -> 5176.54s]  times make me kind of like nauseous I'm just not ready for food the first three
[5176.54s -> 5188.33s]  four hours when I get up but coffee that I can do I usually eat lunch lunch some
[5188.33s -> 5194.29s]  kind of snack some kind of small mid late kind of afternoon meal and then I do
[5194.29s -> 5205.24s]  dinner breakfast is overrated anyways I mean breakfast is incredibly important
[5205.24s -> 5212.30s]  your body needs fuel to burn so you can function it's important to do something
[5212.30s -> 5221.66s]  you have any hue I actually don't have any heels left smoothies are good yeah
[5221.66s -> 5237.99s]  that's that's a good idea you're being played by big breakfast okay let me get

[5293.34s -> 5308.96s]  sprinkled all over it pretty much the same thing Kruger Hoover drums drums I
[5308.96s -> 5322.90s]  feel like that would be a great Skrillex intro I mean don't shoot the drum call

[5513.31s -> 5518.23s]  weasel falls over laughing hits the thing and it moves came out first
[5518.23s -> 5522.27s]  Roger Rabbit was what 80 no just definitely Roger Rabbit came out first
[5522.27s -> 5543.90s]  25 years old all right here we go don't screw this up dip was Monka s Christopher
[5543.90s -> 5549.30s]  Lloyd as the judge is one of one of my favorite acting my favorite characters

[5630.33s -> 5636.62s]  no I don't know what should I do fight what should I do what I didn't make a
[5636.62s -> 5651.84s]  decision oh shit no I'm fine I'm okay I try press space I press space I swear

[5701.97s -> 5708.56s]  screen does that matter hold on professional game I'm not a professional
[5708.56s -> 5715.06s]  gamer by the way we talking about I don't know I barely can tie my shoes

[5774.50s -> 5779.74s]  it or you're gonna get yeah yeah that's right so there's a huge bait here the
[5779.74s -> 5784.79s]  first bait is this is gonna be a bitch I'm gonna turn this down because I can't
[5784.79s -> 5790.36s]  hear it all right so it's definitely get the second time around it's get for sure
[5790.36s -> 5799.64s]  it has to be cuz I'm gonna turn into the zombie person yeah I think so rum

[5875.00s -> 5885.25s]  about me so I'll be able to fight and you do the annoying annoying orange sound
[5885.25s -> 5901.32s]  I'm ignoring whom what am I ignoring are you a furry answer the question no I'm
[5901.32s -> 5907.40s]  not there you go is that is that's matter of fact for you isn't it should
[5907.40s -> 5914.40s]  be matter of fact for you somebody said this is just golden eye except
[5914.40s -> 5930.15s]  everything sucks don't you love it though I'm so glad that we get to like see this
[5930.15s -> 5946.15s]  and experience this time harvester meets James Bond harvester was fucked I would
[5946.15s -> 5957.42s]  not play that game a second time all right let's start the process here get
[5957.42s -> 5970.78s]  the audio back where it should be all right let's go I didn't realize the run
[5970.78s -> 6002.28s]  he screams run at the people drum Kruger Hoover drum from over fight yet so it's
[6002.28s -> 6006.59s]  Hoover and if there's something afterwards again I have to remind myself
[6006.59s -> 6011.52s]  a thousand times it's fight if there's another choice is therefore I would have
[6011.52s -> 6033.32s]  taken the antidote marijuana is a memory loss drug I'm not high that would have
[6033.32s -> 6055.19s]  been a huge mistake for this dream these serious okay don't get it wrong
[6055.19s -> 6060.23s]  every cell in your body is gonna mutate you're gonna be another one of dr. Kruger's
[6060.23s -> 6071.78s]  minor zombies what if get it is wrong then that's not my fault because you all
[6071.78s -> 6076.74s]  we all have come to a consensus here that I need to get it when it's on the
[6076.74s -> 6083.41s]  ground because otherwise I turn into the zombie
[6083.41s -> 6091.11s]  exothermic reaction is gonna multiply that virus me a pole we get a short pole
[6091.11s -> 6097.91s]  as to what I should do on the second after I fight the first time and a pull
[6097.91s -> 6100.99s]  I need cuz I if I'm gonna be wrong I need a bunch of people to be wrong too
[6100.99s -> 6112.49s]  so we can all be wrong together so I don't feel as bad fight or get on the
[6112.49s -> 6120.54s]  second attempt and one that we just died at we go within three minutes Los
[6120.54s -> 6134.15s]  Angeles will be mine perhaps you might enjoy sharing do a prediction it's good
[6134.15s -> 6158.96s]  prediction to take too long okay Hoover Hoover Kruger all right that was a
[6158.96s -> 6174.66s]  perfect opportunity for a will Wilhelm Wilhelm okay fight what do we got 80%
[6174.66s -> 6210.67s]  yet so if I'm wrong you're wrong too this guy shoots so many bullets like I
[6210.67s -> 6223.34s]  probably gonna throw in a rock and hit me easier than his shooting okay fight

[6391.45s -> 6402.04s]  sometimes it's all worth what was what was Laura not get a medal for that he
[6402.04s -> 6410.76s]  sponsored her like kill count at the end there was like fucking 30 people I can't
[6410.76s -> 6429.52s]  do that without her that's cool we need an alternate ending all right I am
[6429.52s -> 6433.76s]  willing to play through one and not play through I just want to there's some
[6433.76s -> 6442.07s]  stuff early that I really want to see there's a lot of other shit that we
[6442.07s -> 6464.77s]  need to know where it goes play I always start from the beginning oh shit I can do
[6464.77s -> 6473.72s]  this checkpoint locked all this somebody locked checkpoints alright I'm not doing
[6473.72s -> 6480.98s]  party party torturing 14,000 people this is some of the most fun I've had in a
[6480.98s -> 6487.20s]  while what are you talking about I love this I'm loving this all right let's go
[6487.20s -> 6497.56s]  to I'm not doing party party is gonna lose all previous progress does that

[6511.28s -> 6537.86s]  censor the screen to make sure it's okay my home away from home crystals
[6537.86s -> 6541.02s]  looking good it actually censored this re-release the original game did have
[6541.02s -> 6558.56s]  nudity interesting okay voiceover lines were not in the original no no way the
[6558.56s -> 6565.07s]  actor actually came back to rerecord them I'm surprised they didn't port this
[6565.07s -> 6570.76s]  to something else here's trouble this whole thing was done even if it was not
[6570.76s -> 6574.32s]  on the Jaguar why would they not they were right so now you can piss off Sega
[6574.32s -> 6581.68s]  Saturn or something take a CD it's Colonel BFD the old man has a problem
[6581.68s -> 6595.08s]  not interested it involves Laura and a dangerous mind control virus shit we
[6595.08s -> 6598.44s]  think she's been kidnapped can't say more it's had an adults-only rating
[6598.44s -> 6603.16s]  walls have ears if you're interested meet me somewhere a little more private
[6603.16s -> 6609.32s]  I'm you nudity in any piece of media is gonna have that and especially in a game
[6609.52s -> 6618.36s]  ESRB rock in a hard place like real people on camera like naked I think that
[6618.36s -> 6626.15s]  would get bad news okay party oh it's just this thing again it's just going

[8004.37s -> 8009.93s]  as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on my flashlight and looked
[8009.93s -> 8014.73s]  around any fool could see that the place had more than its share of ding
[8014.73s -> 8024.78s]  bats and I was no exception this music keeps playing okay explore go looking
[8024.78s -> 8031.83s]  for trouble find the friend who dragged you here I'm gonna explore the cellar it

[8167.20s -> 8176.87s]  I grabbed a candle and headed out a sudden breeze blew out my candle and I
[8176.87s -> 8183.86s]  could barely make out my surroundings in the darkness I should have taken the
[8183.86s -> 8192.21s]  rope or something use your last match go look for another candle uh match don't
[8192.21s -> 8199.68s]  have a flashlight since I didn't get the match lit I never even saw what hit me

[8459.27s -> 8464.63s]  place deserted for nearly 30 years it's packaged up I walked up the creeping
[8464.63s -> 8469.75s]  front steps and turned the knob all right the ladies here I have a choice to
[8469.75s -> 8476.29s]  turn around or get the key from under the mat and then what do I do about the
[8476.29s -> 8480.37s]  lady try just naturally talk to the lady there was a key to fit the front door
[8480.37s -> 8489.13s]  under the mat the stench was awful it was like entering a tomb I just keep
[8489.13s -> 8494.33s]  running from the layers to my right in a room to my left and I felt a cold chill
[8494.33s -> 8504.07s]  on the back of my neck carefully climb should I carefully climb the stairs yeah
[8504.07s -> 8510.03s]  if I sneak I probably can as I ascended the rotting stairs I began to feel as if
[8510.03s -> 8521.23s]  I were being followed from the top of the stairs I could see a woman below okay
[8521.23s -> 8534.56s]  I don't have a weapon holy water use the holy water her skin erupted as the water
[8534.56s -> 8545.76s]  splashed on the stench was awful the second floor looked dark and uninviting
[8545.76s -> 8554.06s]  okay that was a waste I don't know if I could have got away check on her
[8554.06s -> 8559.02s]  condition run into the nearest room right I don't you have so much there's
[8559.02s -> 8567.34s]  not enough time my fear faded as I fled I felt fine till I fell so I flipped over
[8567.34s -> 8572.78s]  and found I'd been followed by a fanged femme fatale with a fried finger it's
[8572.78s -> 8581.54s]  her use the vial of holy water I don't do I have it kick her teeth out oh I
[8581.54s -> 8587.21s]  don't still have any left it wasn't till I cut my hand on the broken glass that I
[8587.21s -> 8601.32s]  realized that the bottle of holy water wasn't shatter proof I just well here we
[8601.32s -> 8606.64s]  go again I don't know how long I was out but someone or something had dragged me
[8606.68s -> 8612.77s]  to a cellar below der Hatchet manor is this guy as I struggled to clear my head
[8612.77s -> 8617.21s]  I clicked on my flashlight and looked around which disappeared after the
[8617.21s -> 8621.85s]  fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats and I was no
[8621.85s -> 8632.68s]  exception find who dragged you in here explode go looking for trouble find who
[8632.68s -> 8638.84s]  dragged you here I don't I think these are all the same thing it was there in
[8638.84s -> 8643.92s]  the cellar that I discovered the little man with the evil grin what's the
[8643.92s -> 8647.73s]  correct play here
[8660.46s -> 8664.82s]  okay stay for dinner all right so now what are the choices don't lunge at him
[8664.82s -> 8673.64s]  grab his shovel glance past him say don't turn around and you bait him he
[8673.68s -> 8680.44s]  fell for it so I took the opportunity to bash him in the chops I never hit a man
[8680.44s -> 8684.80s]  when he's down but I knew I should have made an exception when I felt his
[8684.80s -> 8693.59s]  fingers on my throat you can't be serious
[8695.59s -> 8698.55s]  I have to flip that second option is not gonna do anything
[8699.55s -> 8705.95s]  I flipped him into his coal bin and ran into the darkness
[8712.36s -> 8715.36s]  shovel and be like you know I don't hit a person when they're down even if
[8715.36s -> 8723.26s]  they're a degenerate murdering zombie person find an elevator find the
[8723.26s -> 8734.26s]  elevator I found myself ascending a steep circular stairway when a green
[8734.30s -> 8741.02s]  ghoul in a rented tuxedo made a dramatic entrance these people just went to the
[8741.02s -> 8745.22s]  Halloween store and bought everything on the rack and then just decided to shoot
[8745.22s -> 8749.24s]  stuff with it and they made choices around it they were just having a they
[8749.24s -> 8754.49s]  just having like fun for like a weekend let's make some small talk see if it
[8754.49s -> 8760.63s]  works I approached the zombie reluctant took his hat off and asked him who his
[8760.63s -> 8767.43s]  Taylor was his response was to push me backwards into a rickety old freight
[8767.43s -> 8782.44s]  elevator he took his hat off like oh it's me hello oh floor surprise me um
[8782.44s -> 8793.22s]  surprise me we arrived on the first floor and I got off I could hear faint

[9114.64s -> 9120.80s]  would have probably been that guy at some point something clever I was trying
[9120.80s -> 9130.50s]  to think of a diversion when I lost this was the right thing last thing hits him
[9133.50s -> 9142.58s]  okay you need to get the rope I got up by monster or the actor the actor on

[9316.76s -> 9326.81s]  second floor look dark and uninviting pick a room at random find the kitchen
[9326.81s -> 9340.22s]  the room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort great job finding
[9340.22s -> 9346.00s]  the kitchen there is there was a door to my left another dead ahead but most of
[9346.00s -> 9350.32s]  the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right someone was
[9350.32s -> 9363.61s]  practicing a bizarre form of culinary preparation right let's go right let's
[9363.61s -> 9368.91s]  see I couldn't put my finger on it but there was something odd about the woman
[9368.91s -> 9382.05s]  in the kitchen I think maybe it was her three-day beard okay grab some food and
[9382.05s -> 9397.59s]  go can I look in the fridge oh it's Edna fine a find the edibles find the
[9397.59s -> 9402.54s]  edibles everybody on this house is on him might as well join a clove of
[9402.54s -> 9413.68s]  garlic and a couple of potatoes definitely take the garlic and shove
[9413.68s -> 9429.32s]  that down the boss's throat of garlic okay I'm gonna leave sneak away quietly I
[9429.32s -> 9434.28s]  don't want to do anything else out of the kitchen and left her to her work a
[9434.28s -> 9444.06s]  faint breeze carried a musty odor to my sensitive nostrils okay well over to the
[9444.06s -> 9447.58s]  closed door okay we're gonna peek through that I'm not going in there just
[9447.58s -> 9456.92s]  yet this room seemed to be a laboratory there was something odd about it and
[9456.92s -> 9466.55s]  then I realized what it was the room suddenly I realized that someone was
[9466.55s -> 9475.76s]  coming up behind me the vampire see the teeth jump in the tub and quickly jump
[9475.76s -> 9482.52s]  in the tub thinking quickly I stepped into the shower and pulled the curtain
[9482.52s -> 9492.20s]  closed a hairy paw reached in and turned on the water I peered around the
[9492.20s -> 9498.84s]  corner and saw a she wolf busily primping herself for a night on the town
[9498.84s -> 9512.66s]  this is such a crack game it really is what do I do ah I don't know I'm not

[9823.48s -> 9839.43s]  I'm getting different things explains if I hadn't been so busy talking I might

[9942.15s -> 9961.40s]  was trying to think of a diversion when I think they all do the same thing I
[9961.40s -> 9967.85s]  got up I saw that the pipe it made quite an impression okay use the rope
[9967.85s -> 9994.33s]  during this game sucks okay go all right look let's try look for a sign I'm still

[10027.59s -> 10041.09s]  back down I'm surprised but I don't what if I don't say anything will he keep me
[10041.09s -> 10060.00s]  on this floor back in the elevator right down the hallway the next room I came to

[10132.84s -> 10144.40s]  steak I wasn't hungry now but an instant steak might come in handy later yeah we
[10144.40s -> 10152.33s]  have to put this into his wine right because it goes in you and it's a steak
[10152.33s -> 10158.53s]  and you what about the stench why does it smell because then it'll the steak
[10158.53s -> 10168.85s]  will blow up in his body right it sticks to your ribs yeah that means that it's
[10168.85s -> 10175.76s]  gonna turn into a steak inside your body you could bathe more off all right I
[10175.76s -> 10179.74s]  gotta leave we're gonna we're gonna both die from this like poison I gave him
[10179.74s -> 10188.31s]  five dollars and left if the vampire eats this somehow whether we have I
[10188.31s -> 10194.24s]  don't know how we get it to happen to eat it all right we got to leave we're
[10194.24s -> 10198.91s]  gonna leave leave leave he takes it yeah but that he takes your stuff if you die
[10198.91s -> 10203.13s]  which I haven't died yet if I get knocked out again yeah I ran into the
[10203.13s -> 10209.27s]  next room I heard the scream again this guy we just do avoid this do not go
[10209.27s -> 10216.50s]  investigate this at all just keep no keep moving forward this guy knocks you
[10216.50s -> 10222.65s]  up I ran through the door and found myself near the elevator okay up I
[10222.65s -> 10228.53s]  pushed the button and waited there was a green door to my left and a stairway to
[10228.53s -> 10241.04s]  my right wait for the elevator but what if he comes out let's find the green
[10241.04s -> 10248.34s]  door I walked over and opened the green door well the last thing I remember is
[10248.34s -> 10262.06s]  staring at the hole in his chest where a steak should have been oh come on come
[10262.14s -> 10268.82s]  on I came to in an attic someone or something was sitting across the attic
[10268.82s -> 10288.02s]  from me I wonder this way I can it was difficult not to listen his voice had a
[10288.02s -> 10297.09s]  strong hypnotic effect maybe maybe it's too small maybe he didn't take it okay
[10297.09s -> 10309.47s]  yeah I don't know you I love this cause I know you each time you lapse in
[10309.47s -> 10318.07s]  consciousness I get to know you a little better come sit drink with me it's
[10318.07s -> 10324.87s]  something I picked out close to your heart that was my blood he was sucking
[10324.87s -> 10335.94s]  on okay uh should I offer him a bribe that's the only thing I haven't
[10335.94s -> 10354.92s]  my pockets were empty I love this guy this was count your Chakonsky I knew I
[10354.92s -> 10359.88s]  had failed when I looked into his eyes I was powerless to resist him
[10359.88s -> 10373.26s]  all right I'm gonna try this one more time come on at least well I opened the
[10373.26s -> 10378.78s]  green door and it was okay like I choose your adventure game there's a reason
[10378.78s -> 10384.38s]  why you hold your finger on the previous page because open door on right guy
[10384.38s -> 10388.36s]  kills you you know that's okay well fuck that I'm not doing that one and you keep
[10388.36s -> 10399.94s]  your hand your finger on the tab you go back and you choose the right one you're
[10399.94s -> 10418.82s]  cheating at books that's not cheating it's not cheating there's still so much
[10418.82s -> 10426.29s]  stuff okay where do I what am I doing wrong there's a lot more in this game
[10426.29s -> 10437.20s]  that I really thought there was all right one more try holy water and then
[10437.20s -> 10446.48s]  we're gonna leave he wanted money all right your best but it was for a good
[10446.48s -> 10455.75s]  cause okay it's nice to see you the okay don't send in the next client it's the
[10456.35s -> 10481.03s]  you so I'm gone under the mat of course naturally there was a key to the back of
[10481.03s -> 10490.01s]  my neck okay now what over my shoulder is the girl explore the room everything
[10490.01s -> 10496.96s]  is the girl I think the candlelit room should be okay the room was crawling
[10496.96s -> 10501.72s]  with vermin but otherwise empty she follows oh god damn it she follows you
[10501.76s -> 10506.27s]  both times he follows you in both scenarios I don't think you can avoid
[10506.27s -> 10520.59s]  this wait explain I can't run I could sense that she was attracted to me what
[10520.59s -> 10531.96s]  run tell her she has nice eyes what I don't understand what do you if I hadn't
[10531.96s -> 10536.00s]  been so busy talking I might have noticed what why isn't a run really
[10536.00s -> 10542.63s]  listening I can't believe there's not oh god damn it I could have avoided that
[10542.63s -> 10547.03s]  alright there's one here's how you avoid that one you just have to go up the
[10547.03s -> 10552.75s]  stairs and run as if you go to the candle I was out but someone or
[10552.75s -> 10557.31s]  something had dragged me to a cellar below der Hatchet holy water works but
[10557.31s -> 10561.67s]  she follows you up the stairs as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on
[10561.67s -> 10571.87s]  my flashlight and looked around all right these are these all don't go look
[10571.87s -> 10578.64s]  for trouble these all lead to the same place anyways it was there in the cellar
[10579.48s -> 10588.22s]  so what's the correct thing with this guy don't turn around glance past him
[10588.22s -> 10595.12s]  there's just glance past him but what if we don't attack he fell for it so I took
[10595.12s -> 10599.52s]  the opportunity to bash him in the chops he fell for me looking the other way I
[10599.52s -> 10604.12s]  never hit a man when he's down but I knew I should have made an exception when
[10604.12s -> 10612.97s]  I felt his fingers on my throat can you avoid this guy oh flip over backwards
[10612.97s -> 10632.75s]  right I flipped him into his colbin and ran into the darkness he Egypt ology
[10632.75s -> 10641.55s]  laundry look look for a stairway I don't think we did the stairway last time I
[10641.55s -> 10652.05s]  found myself ascending a steep here's the guy with the hat when a green ghoul
[10652.29s -> 10660.15s]  made a dramatic entrance I wonder if there's a wrong option with this guy
[10660.15s -> 10672.08s]  proceed small I don't think it really matters let's just do small talk I
[10672.08s -> 10680.70s]  approached the zombie I don't want to go I don't want to go down to the what if I
[10680.70s -> 10692.09s]  say mind your own business that's the one option I did not do I could hear
[10692.09s -> 10698.45s]  faint piano music coming from somewhere all right where's the steak kitchen I
[10698.45s -> 10708.63s]  don't I don't remember where the kitchen is is it straight I'm getting so turned
[10708.63s -> 10712.55s]  around like I don't even know what any of these options really go the next room
[10712.55s -> 10717.43s]  I came to had nothing in it okay here we go there was an old freezer on one side
[10717.43s -> 10725.79s]  and a wall full of potions on the other but that we want the steak one we gotta
[10725.79s -> 10754.59s]  give this guy money what about those potion bottles I read the labels extra
[10754.59s -> 10761.35s]  strength potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablets gravity I feel like the
[10761.35s -> 10772.00s]  steak is the is the correct option steak I wasn't hungry now but an instant
[10772.00s -> 10780.40s]  steak might come in handy later stick to your ribs I gotta get up the stair
[10780.40s -> 10791.80s]  okay well should I take the anti-gravity one to anti-grav tablets I noticed
[10791.80s -> 10805.10s]  something strange from the moment I opened the jar get some strength stop
[10805.10s -> 10809.02s]  get the I take the instant strength potion and run taking the extra strength
[10809.02s -> 10815.02s]  I gotta get out of here like a good idea till I read the fine print oh god damn
[10815.14s -> 10824.80s]  we're dead we're dead ask take a deep breath no run run run how do I get out
[10824.80s -> 10832.96s]  run leave the fumes in the room no I'm trying to get out and consequently I oh
[10832.96s -> 10845.27s]  come on so I blacked out well how was I gonna know that like it was there was a
[10846.27s -> 10852.59s]  feeling that I was at the end of my rope the anti-gravity pills fly up I was fit
[10852.59s -> 10868.12s]  to be I did the situation none of this matters I was trying to think of a
[10868.12s -> 10883.58s]  diversion when I started to slip away as the rope bit into my neck okay let's
[10883.58s -> 10892.19s]  get them make good use of the rope I told laughing boys to be out of
[10892.19s -> 10899.60s]  circulation for a while but he didn't appreciate the gag okay so now from here
[10899.60s -> 10905.55s]  look for a sign oh I don't think we clicked this yet I'm pretty sure this is
[10905.55s -> 10920.56s]  one I have not done look for a sign I did I need like a piece of paper that
[10920.56s -> 10924.82s]  has like the blueprint of this house it's just like teleporting around it's
[10924.82s -> 10932.95s]  like how my brain cannot remember where I am oh let's go do this the next room
[10932.95s -> 10936.95s]  contained an old writing desk under the derhatchet family we'll get points for
[10936.95s -> 10946.06s]  getting rid of this on the desk were many items of interest decipher the
[10946.06s -> 10951.78s]  cryptic rune and then that makes him come over and then we put it in the
[10951.78s -> 10958.26s]  thing and we burn up the papers the candle lit itself and a funky phantom
[10958.26s -> 10976.79s]  friar okay enjoy wine and candlelight I extinguished the candle in a glass of
[10977.79s -> 10990.23s]  and the phantom friar gave up the ghost okay so from here was filled down I have
[10990.23s -> 10997.48s]  the coins I need to find my way up to the second floor on the elevator look
[10997.48s -> 11004.07s]  for a way out okay I'll get the golden split we did this last time which takes
[11004.07s -> 11026.89s]  us outside we can go to the elevator okay get in the elevator I want to go to

[11049.06s -> 11059.19s]  here to get to the guy the kitchen all right yeah the kitchen already beat the
[11059.19s -> 11073.06s]  last score the room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort there
[11073.06s -> 11077.66s]  was a door I don't remember what time but most of the action was taking place
[11077.66s -> 11083.06s]  in the kitchen on my right where someone was practicing a bizarre form of here we
[11083.06s -> 11090.60s]  go we're gonna go into the kitchen get the points and towards the right I
[11090.60s -> 11099.08s]  couldn't put my finger on it but there was something good in the kitchen holy
[11099.08s -> 11110.58s]  shit it actually was good I think maybe it was her three-day beard Wow okay look

[11189.04s -> 11192.04s]  was the closed door I gotta get out of here right now
[11192.04s -> 11200.81s]  what it was the room smells like a wet dog suddenly I realized that someone was

[11204.05s -> 11211.18s]  what do I do turn around think quickly what the fuck am I supposed to do think
[11211.18s -> 11217.79s]  quickly thinking quickly I stepped into the shower and pulled the curtain closed
[11217.79s -> 11228.71s]  a hairy paw what should I do I peered around the corner half to flirt with the
[11228.71s -> 11237.26s]  wolf she wolf busily primping herself for a night on the town okay I'm gonna

[11288.50s -> 11292.66s]  across the house say smile and leave the room alright bye-bye smile I don't want
[11292.66s -> 11298.10s]  to have to be followed I stopped for a moment near the doorway okay we've not
[11298.10s -> 11304.02s]  gone as far for good luck enough from here I rounded the corner and very
[11304.02s -> 11310.06s]  nearly bumped into a female vampire she was starting to leave when I gave
[11310.06s -> 11318.25s]  myself away shit okay well I have garlic confront her hide it um confront her I

[11332.22s -> 11341.96s]  guard why can't I attack I came to in an attic someone or something was sitting

[11360.20s -> 11364.12s]  not to listen his voice had a strong hypnotic effect
[11364.12s -> 11372.98s]  I did it well let's just get as many I'm trying to get to 8,000 points you don't
[11372.98s -> 11381.38s]  know me I love this guy but I know you you have in my inventory was all the

[11394.62s -> 11401.18s]  sucking on you have to this is guys this game came out like in 1984 1985 or
[11401.18s -> 11406.87s]  something find something of value I don't have anything quickly I checked my
[11406.87s -> 11418.28s]  pockets what is it what what's going on what's in my pocket
[11418.28s -> 11430.32s]  roll gold coin kick in the groin what should I do I tried to attack but count
[11430.32s -> 11436.66s]  your check on I can't do it into my eyes and I knew I had failed I blacked out
[11436.66s -> 11443.38s]  what would you pick the gold coins out why wouldn't you take why wouldn't
[11443.38s -> 11448.54s]  garlic it be an option why wouldn't the steak pill a holy water he didn't take
[11448.54s -> 11453.10s]  the shit out of my pockets this time I have coin where I throw a coin at him
[11453.10s -> 11459.35s]  why don't you give a coin because I want to try to kick the guy in the groin
[11459.35s -> 11465.88s]  alright this game came out in like 1992 are you serious you don't think it would
[11465.88s -> 11469.88s]  have been like a comedy routine where it's he goes like oh my oh my balls I
[11469.88s -> 11478.06s]  was going for like the stupid like 90s comedy routine this game came out in
[11478.06s -> 11489.78s]  2016 it wasn't yet but it wasn't filmed in 2016 it was filmed in probably like
[11489.78s -> 11508.02s]  1990 shit alright well that was fun game was made in 84 yeah come on well now
[11508.06s -> 11528.41s]  let's watch them well now we can see the music video wait did showing him dying
[11528.41s -> 11546.31s]  what the hell was that we didn't see any of this stuff we didn't get any of these
[11546.31s -> 11574.94s]  options behind the scenes yeah I think the skeleton guys mouth is partially
[11574.94s -> 11591.74s]  made from a baseball mitt is a physical wizard like cantaloupe no not really I
[11591.74s -> 11618.70s]  can't believe there's a wizard that can cast fireball at you play it again oh
[11618.70s -> 11632.47s]  you need to probably have the ace for that the thing with these old games
[11632.47s -> 11635.51s]  those you have to be so weirdly specific about everything to see some
[11635.51s -> 11673.86s]  of this stuff some random lady we saw that plenty of times wait was that the
[11673.86s -> 11688.80s]  real ending villain well that was fun actually in love with this game play
[11688.80s -> 11696.98s]  more play again use a walkthrough I could just use a walkthrough you look at
[11696.98s -> 11699.84s]  the respiration of a 16 millimeter film adaptation of the original interactive
[11699.84s -> 11704.74s]  text adventure designed wait this is an it's a text adventure that's why it
[11704.74s -> 11714.42s]  feels like this uh-huh over the chance to create a feature-length interactive
[11714.42s -> 11721.82s]  film I wanted to read that Empire's Wanted restoration that's really cool I
[11721.82s -> 11728.22s]  did not back-to-back games that just never released it's really interesting I
[11728.22s -> 11740.47s]  love this shit I really do it's kind of old-fashioned way to have the old 16
[11740.47s -> 11748.62s]  millimeter FMV games with all the weird goofy choices I love this shit
[11750.32s -> 11758.39s]  the people still make them now but the people make interactive movies right now
[11758.39s -> 11764.47s]  right there's been a few of them one more playthrough all right one more time
[11764.47s -> 12020.46s]  with I'm gonna get a walkthrough I'm gonna go pee though we're at that boys
[12020.46s -> 12029.02s]  and girls a little bit of an issue here we have a little bit of a small problem
[12029.02s -> 12037.52s]  here I don't think a walkthrough exists for this game I don't see any there are
[12037.52s -> 12052.16s]  no walkthroughs so that's bad make the walkthrough do you even go to the
[12052.16s -> 12061.46s]  bathroom I did I was promised to overwatch I don't I think you're in the
[12061.46s -> 12073.05s]  wrong place nobody's beaten this we'll help you you gotta be quick though you
[12073.05s -> 12076.65s]  gotta be really quick it's like two seconds it takes three seconds for the
[12076.65s -> 12079.33s]  stream delay to kick in for you guys to see what happened we're not gonna be
[12079.33s -> 12098.42s]  able to do it I can't elongate that slow your CPU down what if you alt tab does
[12098.42s -> 12107.78s]  actually let me test that let me see if this works if I like tab out will the
[12107.78s -> 12119.89s]  game stop no it just keeps going yeah it keeps going wait a minute wait a
[12119.89s -> 12125.49s]  minute wait a minute what if I had known this shit this would have been so much
[12125.49s -> 12134.53s]  better guys oh my god damn it take a look at this get a good view get a good
[12134.53s -> 12149.16s]  view the timer doesn't do anything when it gets to zero it's just points I was
[12149.20s -> 12158.26s]  panicking half the time cuz I thought are you kidding me it's just what's your
[12158.26s -> 12168.41s]  score up higher well you can help let's figure this out together and this needs
[12168.41s -> 12176.27s]  to be unanimous so the obvious play here is I can't believe this I could have
[12176.27s -> 12184.22s]  whatever we're gonna meet the gentleman the priest wanted money all right give
[12184.22s -> 12188.02s]  us but it was for a good cause thank you mr. Spencer go to the orphanage
[12188.02s -> 12197.69s]  specter whatever your name is the not deductible okay so this just means a
[12197.69s -> 12202.81s]  lot of points mid points not I don't care if I get zero points I supposed to
[12202.81s -> 12209.35s]  the end of the game okay we do click maps click max is gonna take way too
[12209.35s -> 12221.32s]  long all right the obvious thing here is I have the holy water I don't want to
[12221.32s -> 12227.84s]  send in do click maps I don't even I don't even have it like installed we
[12227.84s -> 12236.09s]  can do quick polls how long does the poll take just give us two seconds to
[12236.09s -> 12238.97s]  click hold all right well then give me a second I gotta like enable it again
[12238.97s -> 12246.18s]  obviously I might not be able to do it no click map the shortest poll is one
[12246.18s -> 12253.14s]  minute that's much easier click okay to enable click maps have you guys click and
[12253.14s -> 12268.09s]  me disable it is like 45 seconds a B or C let's go the very obvious one I know
[12268.09s -> 12279.12s]  how to get here it's B I know how to get us into the room into the door the
[12279.12s -> 12284.28s]  Der Hatchet Institute was founded by a Nobel prize-winning scientist
[12284.28s -> 12292.43s]  this locked is what okay finally we have not done we've only done look under the
[12292.43s -> 12303.54s]  mat what do you guys want to do let's open it up why not well we'll do a full
[12303.54s -> 12315.14s]  chats choice run how does that sound and I look I can look at this as it's
[12315.14s -> 12321.46s]  coming in and yeah it's not gonna take 60 seconds look at 66% of the vote wants
[12321.46s -> 12327.06s]  me to go a so I could theoretically just once it once it becomes like a 50
[12327.06s -> 12331.84s]  to 60% majority I'm just gonna go can you just close the poll like if you
[12331.84s -> 12335.28s]  cancel the poll right now just close it like I know that's 67% of voted for a
[12335.28s -> 12342.79s]  and there's no way bees coming back I can just do it right yeah let's go that
[12342.79s -> 12356.28s]  works on another way inside as I walked around the house I saw an open window
[12356.28s -> 12362.20s]  high above me isn't that where the guy is I found a ladder leaning next to
[12362.20s -> 12374.04s]  another window okay I think that's where the guy is well there we go perfect so
[12374.04s -> 12378.94s]  after the poll is over it gives enough time after majority is seen they just
[12378.94s -> 12383.63s]  keep going that's perfect timing okay we can do the climb the ladder look
[12383.63s -> 12387.51s]  around explore the extensive grounds or move ladder to access the open window
[12387.51s -> 12393.05s]  I'm just gonna tell you I am under the impression here that I think that's the
[12393.53s -> 12402.62s]  the Count Dooku guy the gravest guy is up there this is extraordinarily
[12402.62s -> 12415.07s]  unanimous looks like we're gonna see I moved the ladder and started I hope it's
[12415.07s -> 12420.74s]  him I was halfway through the window looking at the ground below when I was
[12420.74s -> 12426.76s]  struck from above by what felt like a Louisville slugger the gorilla covering
[12426.76s -> 12437.98s]  above me was a bat from the big leagues push its face in swing for the fences
[12437.98s -> 12446.03s]  or maintain a safe distance I doubt any of these work if I'm gonna be honest
[12446.03s -> 12459.14s]  with you a bat from the big leagues well B makes sense because B is part of the
[12459.14s -> 12474.74s]  pun right it's waiting for the fences a big bat from the big leagues all right
[12474.74s -> 12482.01s]  we're gonna be it's unanimous wait for the fence I grabbed the bat with both
[12482.01s -> 12488.23s]  hands and to say it looked angry would be a gross understatement definitely
[12488.23s -> 12500.92s]  hurt the actor okay snare the bat with the rope climb up to the rafters or use
[12500.92s -> 12516.41s]  the rope to escape snare the bat with the rope that's in that it's 80% of the
[12516.41s -> 12529.13s]  vote so far yeah okay it's near the bat I grabbed the rope and a trap door opened
[12529.13s -> 12535.01s]  as a wrong fell for what seemed to be a long long time they hit the ground hard
[12535.01s -> 12539.31s]  fortunately I broke my fall on something soft
[12539.31s -> 12548.61s]  well what do you think you're doing mother doesn't like anybody playing in her laundry do ya mom
[12548.61s -> 12551.17s]  that's right stay out of my laundry
[12551.17s -> 12553.17s]  why did he change his voice halfway through
[12553.17s -> 12565.71s]  this guy was obviously a psycho
[12565.71s -> 12567.71s]  this guy's a psycho
[12567.71s -> 12572.53s]  why does it sound like Bobcat Goldthwait
[12572.53s -> 12580.93s]  I mean I had to like make sounds and make voices and stuff like that it sounds like me
[12581.23s -> 12587.33s]  you guys say this to me all right give the psycho a closer look go find the
[12587.33s -> 12597.12s]  butler give mama a friendly smile well I think this is the death one but we have
[12597.12s -> 12601.86s]  to click it because that's what you guys want to do give mama a friendly smile
[12601.86s -> 12609.15s]  wow what are you waiting for
[12609.15s -> 12620.46s]  yet within striking distance casually gain his confidence or go find the
[12620.46s -> 12638.16s]  butler I'm convinced that you made this game and this is some kind of prank
[12638.16s -> 12657.88s]  stream I wish I did I wish I made this game all right we're gonna be I moved
[12657.88s -> 12666.41s]  cautiously towards mama's boy watch it right okay you guys got that double
[12666.41s -> 12676.49s]  wrong that's double wrong he flattened your nose I don't know how long I was
[12676.49s -> 12682.29s]  out but someone or something had dragged me to a cellar below Der Hatchet Manor
[12682.29s -> 12689.07s]  as I struggled to clear my head I clicked on my flashlight and looked
[12689.07s -> 12694.47s]  around any fool could see that the place had more than its share of dingbats and
[12694.57s -> 12701.97s]  I was no exception FMV game you know how badly I okay here's the problem
[12701.97s -> 12710.73s]  there's I have to be careful for like shotgun blasting out a bunch of ideas
[12710.73s -> 12716.93s]  that I think of really fun because I have to focus on only a few things at a
[12716.93s -> 12726.42s]  time make no mistake about it I would love nothing more than to put hundreds
[12726.42s -> 12733.10s]  and hundreds of hours of time and any amount of money doesn't matter how much
[12733.10s -> 12739.32s]  it would cost to make an FMV game that's like this but holy shit that is
[12739.32s -> 12743.92s]  like a monumental undertaking and there's no way I'm gonna be able to do
[12743.92s -> 12753.62s]  it there's only so many things I can be in the tank you can't load up too much
[12753.62s -> 12757.35s]  luggage in your car to the point where your car is touching the ground because
[12757.35s -> 12768.89s]  it won't drive yeah I can't weigh the car down with 500 cinder blocks make
[12768.89s -> 12777.59s]  that one the last bit before retirement I explore the seller it was there in the
[12777.69s -> 12782.79s]  seller that I discovered the little man with the evil grin I've actually talked
[12782.79s -> 12785.79s]  about it before with people in the community about like things that I've
[12785.79s -> 12791.09s]  wanted to do but it's just I can't I get if it's too much to think about too much
[12791.09s -> 12812.79s]  to do all right I mean we already know how this one plays out I probably just
[12812.79s -> 12823.78s]  did this on my own yeah we it's don't turn around and then we flip them he fell
[12823.88s -> 12830.48s]  for it so I took the opportunity to bash him in the chops I never hit a man when
[12830.48s -> 12835.48s]  he's down but I knew I should have made an exception when I felt his fingers on
[12835.48s -> 12846.47s]  my throat how fucking awesome how fun would that be oh man imagine making a
[12846.47s -> 12855.97s]  full FMV game and we just do it what you guys play it I don't even play it you
[12856.07s -> 12865.86s]  guys pick like this god damn it that would be fun yeah do it I don't tell me
[12865.86s -> 12874.72s]  to do these things because I will fuck up every other project just give me a
[12874.72s -> 12879.21s]  little bit more time and I have a lot more things to talk about it's a little
[12879.21s -> 12886.15s]  bit more time I want to do so many of these things a little bit more time all
[12886.15s -> 12891.88s]  right what are we doing all right well Chad is deciding to lose another heart
[12892.38s -> 12901.06s]  so we're going to tickle him he just tightened his grip and laughed well you
[12901.06s -> 12915.34s]  died I woke up with the feeling that I was at the end of my room it didn't work
[12915.34s -> 12921.71s]  realize that I was you lost a heart he tied the situation was bad and my life
[12921.71s -> 12927.11s]  hung in the balance but this was no time for reflection just make an unfinished
[12927.11s -> 12930.51s]  FMV project and have somebody else need to finish it in 30 years that's really
[12930.51s -> 12937.77s]  funny well it would have to be shot in 16 millimeter that's one of things I'm
[12937.77s -> 12942.36s]  gonna make it really incredibly incredibly clear if I'm if I were to do
[12942.36s -> 12952.70s]  this it's being shot in 16 millimeter I don't care how expensive it is this
[12952.70s -> 12966.96s]  needs to be led that way it's gonna be like two million dollars fuck it I don't
[12966.96s -> 12972.37s]  think it's gonna cause that much do 16 millimeter and then get it restored into
[12973.07s -> 12984.04s]  Wow now that's a big brain play that's a big brain play somebody say cringe all
[12984.04s -> 12988.34s]  right we all know this is easy all these are the same I was trying to think of a
[12988.34s -> 12999.16s]  diversion when I lost my footing started to slip away as the rope bit into my
[12999.16s -> 13007.13s]  neck have us pay for it do like a pay-per-view stream when I got up I saw
[13007.13s -> 13014.36s]  that the pipe had made quite an impression on laughing boy I wouldn't
[13014.36s -> 13018.06s]  want to do okay here's what I wouldn't want to do I wouldn't want to make it so
[13018.06s -> 13023.48s]  people couldn't watch it even if that okay let's say that this whole project if
[13023.48s -> 13026.26s]  it was ever if it was ever done remember this is not me saying it's
[13026.26s -> 13031.59s]  happening I'm just saying that's even I'm interested if it was oh here's an
[13031.59s -> 13035.51s]  idea we'll make the whole thing and then the stream will be you pay for the
[13035.51s -> 13041.76s]  stream like a pay-per-view stream no I want as many people to experience that
[13041.76s -> 13049.06s]  as humanly possible right maybe do paid physical copies yeah I'm honestly I
[13049.06s -> 13053.87s]  would not give a shit at all I mean obviously I don't want to like lose like
[13053.87s -> 13058.16s]  millions of dollars like that would be fucking devastating I don't have
[13058.16s -> 13063.78s]  millions of dollars it would be pretty bad maybe there's a way maybe that well
[13063.78s -> 13071.31s]  maybe I'll find a way all right what do you guys want to make yeah of course I
[13071.31s -> 13078.46s]  told laughing boy he was bound to be out of circulation for a while but he
[13079.40s -> 13091.23s]  losing millions is really funny though no really okay well all right this is
[13091.23s -> 13105.32s]  where it all goes completely off the rails what about getting it sponsored
[13105.32s -> 13118.87s]  yeah you don't know and do get the sign we need to be done with actors shot on
[13118.87s -> 13138.20s]  film I wanted to be old where we going I would make yourself an actor no I would
[13138.20s -> 13141.28s]  know I don't be the only actor I would be I would be in it for like 10 seconds
[13141.42s -> 13157.04s]  I'd be like the the old prospector that you run into in a hallway somewhere this
[13157.04s -> 13162.97s]  is also pretty you this is very unanimous look for some artifacts the
[13162.97s -> 13168.13s]  next room contained an old writing desk under the derhatchet family crest on the
[13168.13s -> 13180.26s]  desk were many items of interest you get streamers to be actors no I don't think
[13180.26s -> 13185.61s]  so I don't want anyone I feel like okay I want them to be unknown I don't want
[13185.61s -> 13190.22s]  anyone to know who they are I wanted to be actors I wanted to be I'd like to be
[13190.22s -> 13198.55s]  like real because here's the thing stuff like that would be really funny but let
[13198.55s -> 13204.19s]  you say it was like streamer X it's no it's it's like streamer X playing
[13204.19s -> 13210.86s]  character right it's not that's the that's a monster on the screen so if I
[13210.86s -> 13213.78s]  would ever do that exactly the same reason why I said I don't even want to
[13213.78s -> 13218.61s]  be in it either like I would want to be in it for like 10 seconds as like an
[13218.61s -> 13222.25s]  Easter egg I don't want to be in this I want to hire I want to like direct
[13222.25s -> 13228.03s]  actors right because then it's just oh look it's germa as this character you
[13228.03s -> 13235.26s]  know I'm saying so now it would be all just actors that we would be hiring and
[13235.26s -> 13241.26s]  I'm talking like this is happening soon but it's not if it did happen it would
[13241.26s -> 13248.42s]  be like that all right uh taste the wine you we already know how to do this one
[13248.42s -> 13257.67s]  we already know how to do this one why are you doing this as I reached forward
[13257.67s -> 13275.30s]  the candle lit itself and as if by magic a monk appeared well this is a
[13275.40s -> 13283.35s]  different option now play more of these games if you're a relatively new viewer
[13283.35s -> 13289.03s]  gold motion video games I've played almost all of them over the last five
[13289.03s -> 13295.93s]  years or so there actually aren't very many left that I haven't played some of
[13295.93s -> 13298.99s]  the new ones I haven't played the ones that have come out in the last year or
[13298.99s -> 13307.84s]  two and we're gonna be drunk the flame in the wine oh yeah okay wish the candle
[13307.84s -> 13316.08s]  and a glass of the house vino and the Phantom friar gave up the ghost at least
[13316.08s -> 13321.22s]  the ones that look like we'd have a good time playing them right some FMV
[13321.22s -> 13326.28s]  games that are very much meant to be taken very seriously and it's not like
[13326.28s -> 13329.24s]  oh my god look at how funny that was look at how bizarre of a scenario that
[13329.24s -> 13332.80s]  was it's just actors doing things in front of a camera so it's supposed to
[13332.80s -> 13340.48s]  be taken seriously and not like oh let's have a fun time and laugh at this all
[13340.48s -> 13356.28s]  right pocket the gold and split I think that's what it's gonna be it is you guys
[13356.28s -> 13374.38s]  cannot make another mistake hey you want to go I don't want to say anything
[13374.38s -> 13380.19s]  because it's kind of close what is the baseball stream baseball stream is going
[13380.19s -> 13387.89s]  to be at some point in the first quarter or second quarter of next year somewhere
[13387.89s -> 13393.48s]  when baseball is played it was a theory that we might be able to get it done
[13393.48s -> 13403.25s]  this year but it's not gonna happen too cold but that I refuse to not do that
[13403.25s -> 13409.96s]  stream and what about grotto beasts grotto beasts actually let's do this
[13409.96s -> 13418.12s]  right now I want to shout this out so grotto beasts I can't give you a time or
[13418.12s -> 13422.98s]  date for that but I really really want you to be able to have that stuff in
[13422.98s -> 13432.93s]  your hands the physical cards in your hands by the latest quarter one of this
[13432.93s -> 13438.20s]  coming year I'm giving a huge window for that because it's very very possible
[13438.20s -> 13445.38s]  that's way earlier but I don't want to rush people on the work that they're
[13445.38s -> 13453.91s]  doing so if you get it at some point at the end of this year or January maybe
[13453.91s -> 13457.75s]  you do but I'm not gonna tell you that because I don't want to put on a
[13458.01s -> 13463.23s]  dumb amount of pressure on people to have to get stuff done that's I don't
[13463.23s -> 13466.59s]  know I do not want to do that so whenever it's done and whenever it's like
[13466.59s -> 13475.68s]  okay it's ready to go and with that let's go ahead and talk about this so the
[13475.68s -> 13484.76s]  grotto beasts team has a Twitter and they post various updates I actually just
[13484.76s -> 13493.45s]  retweeted them on Halloween here's the official grotto beasts Twitter account
[13493.45s -> 13500.31s]  let me put it in the chat go give it a follow if you want to know more about
[13500.45s -> 13510.54s]  grotto beasts coming up they post all the time all the various artists and
[13510.54s -> 13524.98s]  here you go here is the official Twitter of the grotto beasts trading card game I
[13524.98s -> 13532.89s]  was holding off on talking about this until it was clear that we had sort of
[13532.89s -> 13540.14s]  like an end goal of soon grotto beast NFTs this these are not NFTs but now
[13540.14s -> 13546.53s]  there's not gonna be an NFT there won't be any grotto beast NFTs this is you're
[13546.53s -> 13550.03s]  gonna be able to hold these in your hand well not you get that it's a you're
[13550.03s -> 13557.12s]  gonna be a whole it's cards you will be able to purchase and open for yourself
[13557.12s -> 13568.05s]  packs of grotto beasts by the way let's make this very clear too if you think
[13568.05s -> 13573.52s]  that this was just gonna be a repackaged thing that I opened on the stream you
[13573.52s -> 13584.36s]  are so wrong there's going to be an astronomical more amount of cards and
[13584.36s -> 13589.74s]  it's gonna have a playable game behind it as well you're actually gonna be able
[13589.74s -> 13600.58s]  to play this with people it's a real game have a game designer and hey hope
[13600.58s -> 13603.88s]  you like it when it comes out because there's other stuff that I haven't
[13603.88s -> 13610.81s]  talked about yet with it too but you know what yeah fuck it let's just talk
[13610.81s -> 13621.31s]  about it why not hey I I'm the goddamn CEO okay um should I hold off on some
[13621.31s -> 13632.03s]  stuff so the grotto beasts card game is going to end up being a pretty
[13632.03s -> 13638.97s]  significant when people talk about like merch right oh what what should you do
[13639.39s -> 13642.87s]  a t-shirt I could do another t-shirt oh maybe I'll do a t-shirt maybe I'll do
[13642.87s -> 13647.23s]  something else so maybe I'll do like a toy or something in the grotto beast
[13647.23s -> 13654.49s]  card game there's going to be not just grotto beasts it's not just gonna be
[13654.49s -> 13662.41s]  grotto beasts it's gonna be tons and tons of this channel's references
[13662.41s -> 13674.22s]  characters it's gonna be a gigantic crossover so it's not just simply the
[13674.22s -> 13678.45s]  grotto beasts there's potentially lots of other things too that you'll be able
[13678.47s -> 13689.63s]  to have and collect it's the biggest crossover event ever and it's two things
[13689.63s -> 13695.10s]  that were created in on this same channel in this same community it's not
[13695.10s -> 13707.42s]  even a crossover event it's the same goddamn channel so I've been pretty
[13707.42s -> 13710.62s]  tight-lipped about this because I don't I didn't want to like hype this up until
[13710.62s -> 13715.50s]  I knew that it was gonna start to become a thing so it's a game you can actually
[13715.50s -> 13723.98s]  play it you don't even have to he's losing viewers no stay don't please
[13723.98s -> 13731.34s]  don't leave please don't leave please what about people that were in the
[13731.64s -> 13756.84s]  rumble actually 20 community subs of Anto uh yes so that there's a lot of
[13756.84s -> 13762.14s]  plans for like that project in the future maybe just know that it's gonna
[13762.14s -> 13767.80s]  have a lot of cards is gonna be I don't want to talk too much about it because I
[13767.80s -> 13771.54s]  don't want to get anything wrong and community Jake right now might be
[13771.54s -> 13775.88s]  fucking speed dialing me going like don't stop talking so I gotta be careful
[13775.88s -> 13784.12s]  I don't want to talk too much but follow that Twitter you're gonna get that's

[13873.04s -> 13878.46s]  we're gonna okay I community Jake's gonna scream at me I'm gonna get

[13884.32s -> 13890.54s]  gonna I'm okay let's go there's no NFTs associated with this what the fuck I
[13890.54s -> 13901.17s]  never said that what about EU I I don't I I have no answer for that time I don't
[13901.17s -> 13906.54s]  I currently do not have an answer for this time I'm I think so I just can't
[13906.54s -> 13909.34s]  give you an answer I don't know I do not have an answer for this time and my
[13909.34s -> 13918.16s]  phone just blew up I've got eight unread notifications on my phone I see a stop
[13918.16s -> 13924.20s]  sign emoji a hundred times okay I probably should let's go ahead and play
[13924.20s -> 13943.30s]  the game what did you guys pick it was a I don't remember I can't it was B all
[13943.30s -> 13956.87s]  right B let's go on the steps above me a green ghoul gestured gracefully I'm
[13956.87s -> 13959.91s]  really really excited for not just the fact that the grotto beast are really
[13959.91s -> 13964.84s]  awesome but it's gonna be this interesting kind of mix of like a ton of
[13964.84s -> 13975.33s]  references to this the last decade plus of this channel and community it's a
[13975.33s -> 13989.23s]  really interesting way I was hopeful to do merch and we're going a proceed boldly
[13989.23s -> 13999.01s]  I approached the zombie reluctantly and asked him who his tailor was his
[13999.01s -> 14007.06s]  response was to push me backwards into a rickety old freight elevator yeah you said
[14007.06s -> 14021.22s]  boldly you end up gonna do the germa joke plus two minus two futures market
[14021.22s -> 14030.87s]  with channel points that seems like a fun idea yeah I did but that's the
[14030.87s -> 14035.56s]  problem this is why I get into trouble I get in a lot of trouble because we
[14035.56s -> 14041.05s]  pay okay I tell I tell you guys about four or five different things that
[14041.05s -> 14046.84s]  sound really interesting don't they but in reality only one or two of those
[14046.84s -> 14053.03s]  things can possibly be worked on so what ends up happening is you are like oh my
[14053.03s -> 14057.51s]  god he talked about like four or five different cool things going on when in
[14057.51s -> 14061.84s]  realities one of these things is actually gonna work these are all things
[14061.84s -> 14065.16s]  that I really want to do every time I talk it's things that I really want to
[14065.16s -> 14074.73s]  do but here's the thing right since the dollhouse stream there's been some
[14074.73s -> 14083.36s]  potential here to do more possibly maybe hopefully maybe find more people that
[14083.36s -> 14088.36s]  are willing to get on board and help us pay for projects and help us do things
[14088.36s -> 14094.69s]  there some of these things are possible now because the dollhouse happened and
[14094.69s -> 14101.28s]  the dollhouse was a really really fun time so I can't tell you exactly what's
[14101.28s -> 14107.20s]  gonna happen because I still don't even know but if some of these doors are
[14107.20s -> 14111.97s]  starting to open a little bit more with like okay now people are aware that I
[14111.97s -> 14117.21s]  want to do big projects and I need capital and I need people and I need
[14117.21s -> 14122.13s]  more crew members and stuff right like this is all stuff that's knowledgeable
[14122.13s -> 14128.81s]  to a lot of people now so if I can get some of these things to help make these
[14128.81s -> 14139.06s]  projects come faster that's what I'm gonna do networking Andy well you bet
[14139.06s -> 14147.51s]  your ass that I want to try to make some of these things reality right and if
[14147.51s -> 14151.96s]  they do become a reality that's what makes me happy I don't care about
[14151.96s -> 14157.12s]  anything else I really don't I don't give a shit about anything else I could
[14157.12s -> 14161.48s]  not make a single dollar from us any of the projects none of them zero I would
[14161.48s -> 14167.05s]  not give a flying fuck at all I wouldn't care at all I don't care if they that
[14167.05s -> 14171.84s]  the projects can be paid for and I don't have to worry about it then fucking
[14171.84s -> 14180.64s]  perfect that's exactly what I want I don't care he's lying by the way I'm
[14180.64s -> 14192.13s]  not I swear I promise you I don't care you've seen okay you've seen the leak I
[14192.13s -> 14196.01s]  don't even need to tell you that like we've made a jokes about it before do I
[14196.01s -> 14201.65s]  really need to make a shitload of money on each project because I'm I have to
[14201.65s -> 14220.79s]  no I don't care I'm for 98 yeah I'm not a liar says the life yeah all right I am
[14220.79s -> 14228.01s]  a liar I I'm a liar but not in not unimportant stuff like this I'm not
[14228.01s -> 14233.57s]  trying to make a bunch of money I'm trying to have things be paid for right
[14233.57s -> 14239.38s]  that I'm I care about and sometimes people will hear about some of the how
[14239.38s -> 14244.36s]  much some of this these projects costed right holy shit it was that much money
[14244.36s -> 14253.55s]  yeah I sometimes it has to be but don't get do not give me any money I'm seeing
[14253.55s -> 14256.83s]  people give money don't do that stop giving me money right now I demand it
[14256.83s -> 14262.64s]  somebody's give me a hundred dollars thank you for do not do not give me any
[14262.64s -> 14268.81s]  money stop that immediately I command it I demand it I demand it it ends at once
[14268.81s -> 14281.94s]  are we going stop reverse engineer Andy I'm just saying all right just know in
[14281.94s -> 14288.32s]  the future whatever projects we do I'm just I'm glad that they were able to
[14288.32s -> 14294.94s]  happen that's it just think about this this is like the kind of shit that I've
[14294.94s -> 14301.47s]  wanted to since I was like fucking 12 right I cannot even begin to tell you
[14301.47s -> 14307.51s]  guys just how how it feels to like something that I wanted to do when I was

[14315.27s -> 14319.72s]  from when I was a kid it's unbelievable to me and the fact that I'm able just to
[14319.72s -> 14327.93s]  do that alone just just by itself is worth more than anything anything so the
[14327.93s -> 14341.16s]  fact that I can sit here and talk like this is already enough just want to be
[14341.16s -> 14353.30s]  clear Jesus fucking Christ just play the game already I just I just had a major

[14408.11s -> 14412.87s]  about from only me oh I'm the only one that cares about not receiving a
[14412.87s -> 14418.47s]  monitor I'm the only one no I don't want you to think that either I love money
[14418.47s -> 14437.03s]  okay here we go all right walk straight this I don't think I've done this before
[14437.03s -> 14448.97s]  the next room I came to had nothing in it there was an old freezer on one side
[14448.97s -> 14460.64s]  and a lot of potions on the other just as I started to examine them I heard a
[14460.64s -> 14477.47s]  scream open the freezers the correct play we've all seen it like five times
[14477.47s -> 14489.72s]  already although there's opening the freezer stop whatever the laughing
[14489.76s -> 14501.76s]  screaming person coming in the room I think Coolsville sucks just open the
[14501.76s -> 14520.33s]  freezer ignoring the fumes I opened the freezer I love this guy uh can I just do
[14520.33s -> 14549.02s]  this on my own because I know how to get there please do okay I read the labels
[14549.02s -> 14559.92s]  extra strength potion instant steak pill anti-grav tablets okay so it's the
[14559.92s -> 14568.65s]  take the steak and leave I wasn't hungry now but an instant steak might come in
[14568.65s -> 14581.28s]  handy later where's your choice that's what everybody was gonna pick all right
[14581.28s -> 14587.07s]  this is it's a and then you leave these are both this is gonna kill us so don't
[14587.39s -> 14609.61s]  be stupid about this thank you
[14630.17s -> 14646.97s]  yeah we gotta get out of this room it's your one-year anniversary with the sus
[14646.97s -> 14671.04s]  face I want a divorce I gave him five dollars and left all right this is a
[14671.08s -> 14674.28s]  tough call because I don't remember exactly which one of these means you get
[14674.28s -> 14695.52s]  grabbed how do you feel about the rats becoming extremely popular and tick-tock
[14695.52s -> 14701.19s]  sorry say that again so that one more time I didn't hear that that well say
[14701.19s -> 14712.52s]  that again I won't say that again the rats are incredibly popular on tick-tock
[14712.52s -> 14716.40s]  the rats are huge on tick-tock I'm sorry I'm leaning with my ear say that one
[14716.40s -> 14725.95s]  more time what do we talk about like a few weeks ago what that I I am huge on
[14725.95s -> 14732.06s]  tick-tock and I'm not even there so I'm excuse me I'm just trying to understand
[14732.10s -> 14742.49s]  why everyone was saying that that was not accurate the rats are also huge on
[14742.49s -> 14756.52s]  Facebook all right let's search the room the rats are popular not you bozo as I
[14756.52s -> 14763.63s]  ran into the next room I heard the scream again I am the rats the rats are
[14763.63s -> 14774.72s]  nothing without me should I make a tick-tock video of doing the rat song but
[14774.72s -> 14779.10s]  make sure I'm doing it really poorly and I'd be pretty relatively unknown on
[14779.10s -> 14782.98s]  tick-tock would people like hate me for it would be like oh that was terrible
[14782.98s -> 14788.20s]  nice try my video is way better on the tick on the rats meme it's like I'm I'm
[14788.20s -> 14796.78s]  the one who made it talking to you talking to the guy that made it up keep
[14796.78s -> 14805.42s]  moving forward why you're not actually gonna do this are you I ran through the
[14805.42s -> 14809.94s]  door and found myself near the elevator oh I thought you fall I pushed the
[14809.94s -> 14815.46s]  button and waited there was a green door to my left and a stairway to my right
[14815.46s -> 14826.27s]  okay I know for a fact we don't do the green door this is a really important
[14826.27s -> 14848.28s]  decision but I'm just kidding I scramble up the stairs is it time to
[14848.28s -> 14868.26s]  release release release is it time to release the third rat song I wonder if
[14868.26s -> 14881.13s]  we're gonna get to the end at the top of the stairs I saw an ugly dwarf private
[14881.13s -> 14896.24s]  eye versus private eye gory how tall am I okay show him your license take
[14896.24s -> 14913.54s]  evasive action or put down that shovel take evasive action when he moved I
[14913.54s -> 14919.10s]  jumped over the railing it was a long way to the first floor and laughing boy
[14919.10s -> 14929.56s]  was no help at all that would hurt so bad holy shit that was painful looking
[14929.56s -> 14942.55s]  I think you guys are in some trouble here grab his shirt and pull punch with
[14942.55s -> 14947.05s]  your stronger hand or let go of the railing grab his shirt and pull is
[14947.05s -> 14957.57s]  winning by a way too much I grabbed his shirt and flipped over the railing symbol
[14957.57s -> 14976.92s]  crash the second floor looked dark and uninviting okay where we go I told my
[14976.92s -> 14980.60s]  friend who used to work for the company that helped with this game and he
[14980.60s -> 14985.21s]  thought that it was crazy that you were playing it and as we're having a great
[14985.21s -> 14993.09s]  time the last one too I applaud the companies that actually tried to restore
[14993.09s -> 15001.99s]  this stuff this is awesome I'm having a lot of fun ask your friend how to beat
[15001.99s -> 15018.63s]  the game all right we're going I don't know it's 51 42 a and C if it were me I
[15018.63s -> 15022.49s]  would probably pick the one that we didn't do yet which is probably whatever
[15022.49s -> 15026.17s]  medical records so and that's winning right now so that's what I'm gonna pick
[15026.17s -> 15040.27s]  the room I next entered was obviously a library of some sort well it's in
[15040.27s -> 15045.39s]  regardless I'm gonna get the garlic there was a door to my left another dead
[15045.39s -> 15050.31s]  ahead but most of the action was taking place in the kitchen on my right where
[15050.31s -> 15060.81s]  someone was practicing a bizarre form of culinary preparation but we don't
[15060.81s -> 15072.73s]  necessarily have to do the kitchen but the garlic seems pretty important huh
[15072.73s -> 15084.25s]  yes the library kitchen I couldn't put my finger on it but there was something
[15084.25s -> 15092.99s]  odd about the woman in the kitchen it's really cold in this room I think maybe
[15092.99s -> 15099.28s]  the breath coming out of you see that you see just how cold it is in there I
[15099.28s -> 15111.95s]  feel bad for the actor oh yeah we look in the bad we're gonna look in the
[15111.95s -> 15134.05s]  fridge of course I find other edibles we've gotten this right plenty of times
[15134.05s -> 15138.52s]  make the FMV game and make sure there's no references to you in it no they won't
[15138.52s -> 15144.36s]  be it would be it would be I mean well they'd be you'd probably know I made it
[15144.40s -> 15151.93s]  somehow but this would not be a like German 985 FMV experience it'd be like
[15151.93s -> 15161.51s]  an old Western game or something like an old horror game inside the cupboard was
[15161.51s -> 15184.96s]  a rose a clove of garlic and a couple of potatoes don't tell us you made it and
[15184.96s -> 15188.78s]  just play it one day well I think it would be really fun if the first
[15188.78s -> 15196.00s]  experience ever with the game was on the stream and you guys are doing this maybe
[15196.00s -> 15201.33s]  we'll build like an extension or something I have like some kind of use
[15201.33s -> 15208.73s]  of an extension for you guys to do it easier so you guys are get the first
[15208.73s -> 15211.97s]  experience of the game and then like I reached in and took the clove of God a
[15211.97s -> 15220.44s]  week later or something it goes on steam or whatever stop giving him an idea he
[15220.44s -> 15237.32s]  only cares about money I care about money I don't only care about money
[15237.32s -> 15244.56s]  money's somewhere on the list somewhere take the potato I feel like I'm gonna
[15244.56s -> 15262.52s]  get hurt I you guys really I think a is you took too much die and we get stabbed
[15262.52s -> 15299.48s]  this is a GG I thank you all right well I came to something was sitting across
[15299.48s -> 15320.18s]  the attic from me this doesn't matter oh I feel like we've met before
[15323.26s -> 15327.82s]  that's my favorite shot of the whole thing he's kind of leaned over you all said a
[15327.82s -> 15349.15s]  anyways I want this guy that was my he was sucking on this character okay this
[15349.15s -> 15370.92s]  is actually important I want that exact character in another game find something
[15370.92s -> 15386.66s]  value I should have the coins quickly I checked my pockets okay throw a gold
[15386.66s -> 15393.43s]  coin that's the only option that probably results in something different
[15393.43s -> 15406.93s]  that's a different video clip let's try it I threw it in his mouth expecting him
[15406.93s -> 15417.16s]  to choke to death what but instead when I looked in his eyes I knew I had failed
[15417.16s -> 15436.44s]  I was powerless to resist him that sucked that sucked it was a great throw
[15436.44s -> 15446.52s]  but Jesus okay you guys want one more chance at this I'm gonna give you one
[15446.52s -> 15459.54s]  more chance let's get to the end I know you can do it collectively I know you can
[15459.54s -> 15469.75s]  is there another FMV I have this I have one more that's ready for right now but
[15469.75s -> 15474.27s]  it's new and I don't know I'm not sure if I want to do it right now it looks
[15474.27s -> 15488.80s]  like it might be long depends on how long it is is it the battle royale one
[15488.80s -> 15504.71s]  omega lol it is why are you saying that omega lol omega lol omega lol no chance
[15504.71s -> 15525.30s]  what do you mean or tonight is not an FMV dude it's short all right well let's
[15525.30s -> 15529.49s]  try it this I this is really fun though I like this a lot

[17468.52s -> 17476.70s]  right the thing I'm switching the poison on myself I don't want to do this is it
[17476.70s -> 17488.24s]  my gun on right like this one or gun on my left it's your left so it would be
[17488.24s -> 17494.87s]  this one is left and left is the one that does not work so I'm gonna give her
[17494.87s -> 17501.55s]  this one okay these are all pretty old you only use them if we need to that
[17501.55s -> 17514.61s]  screwed that one works damn it that one works shit I reversed the poison on
[17514.61s -> 17529.92s]  myself I actually did the thing from princess bread I freaked out investigate
[17529.92s -> 17544.32s]  don't shoot I'm not armed where's your landing group I'm on my own or shit I
[17544.32s -> 17547.88s]  overshot the landing been out here all night where where your bruises where
[17547.88s -> 17555.93s]  scratches horseshit shoot him shoot him yeah yeah seriously man you don't want
[17555.93s -> 17566.40s]  to do this shoot him shoot him no scratches no I probably shouldn't have
[17566.40s -> 17573.47s]  done that I've done that I could just oh I just landed no scratches no bruises oh
[17573.47s -> 17576.71s]  yeah I just landed away from my group yeah right look around they're out here
[17576.71s -> 17591.75s]  they're probably hiding dead yep and he had a gun thank you everybody wants to
[17591.95s -> 17628.18s]  I'm a psycho I just saved the goddamn team hesitation is defeat no if
[17628.18s -> 17633.80s]  everyone's look that's the thing if you landed away from your group you're not
[17633.80s -> 17640.08s]  going to hide behind a tree and approach another group choco boy 89 not a chance
[17640.28s -> 17646.72s]  why would you sneak up on another group that's not gonna happen I did what I had
[17646.72s -> 17655.80s]  to do camo camo so in right now really you never see it anywhere seriously
[17655.80s -> 17660.44s]  though what is this shite these guns are almost antique we should head for the
[17660.44s -> 17667.44s]  Sun see that what about it it's got to be something it's not in the
[17667.44s -> 17672.60s]  lock exactly there's a bridge up ahead from there we can either go straight
[17672.60s -> 17680.43s]  through or we can go I don't know straight ahead I feel like everyone's
[17680.43s -> 17685.80s]  gonna be going around nobody wants to do the straight shot because as well it's
[17685.80s -> 17689.08s]  too far in the open we don't want to be too exposed but isn't everybody gonna be
[17689.08s -> 17703.96s]  going around I think it's straight on I say we go straight through let's go see
[17703.96s -> 17710.94s]  if we can catch someone off guard no we go the other way and make sense we
[17711.42s -> 17719.77s]  serious I didn't just get telltale did I have the trust of his teammates what's
[17719.77s -> 17723.37s]  it gonna take to pull this back oh wait they don't trust me it's actually a
[17723.37s -> 17732.68s]  meter oh shit they won't listen to me that's actually kind of interesting
[17732.68s -> 17741.24s]  it's illusion of choice but it's not really an illusion of choice is this a
[17741.24s -> 17745.08s]  team morale meter and they would have listened to me if I if I didn't they
[17745.08s -> 17752.92s]  didn't hate me or something what's the difference between a liberal and a poppy
[17752.92s -> 17764.48s]  a puppy stops whining when it grows up landmine here comes the landmine or
[17764.48s -> 17767.84s]  maybe they're gonna keep him around long enough to like make everybody like hate
[17767.84s -> 17782.25s]  him and then they'll kill him I don't know I'm just gonna keep walking by the
[17782.25s -> 17791.40s]  way let's talk strategy here why would you ever talk like that with your
[17791.40s -> 17794.52s]  teammates in a life-or-death scenario where you need to like have each other's
[17794.52s -> 17801.33s]  backs but I feel I feel like you don't want your teammates to like fucking hate
[17801.33s -> 17805.33s]  your guts regardless of any of this right I would you want why would you do
[17805.33s -> 17813.61s]  that everybody is like hating this guy and he's like I'm being like political
[17813.61s -> 17818.34s]  and I like a dick isn't that hot look at me like why wouldn't you want to like
[17818.34s -> 17824.92s]  have your back with your teammates this is a life-and-death scenario with
[17824.92s -> 17851.76s]  everybody here what the fuck did you find any what's going on here I saw
[17851.76s -> 17857.96s]  something up ahead like a building what's with the blood don't point the
[17857.96s -> 17862.04s]  gun back at your face that was really bad
[17863.04s -> 17875.22s]  um I what why do you have blood all over your face I mean it's very very it's
[17875.22s -> 17880.94s]  very very very odd that it would be that high like okay have you shot somebody
[17880.94s -> 17886.19s]  like and they sprayed blood on it would be like kind of here here here yeah
[17886.19s -> 17891.55s]  she's blood like on her face up here why that's very that's that's a little odd I
[17891.55s -> 17896.38s]  don't you need to explain this here what you seem awfully eager to get us
[17896.38s -> 17906.95s]  this outpost what's waiting there hey hey is this the doubt is this the fuck you
[17906.95s -> 17919.74s]  Nick you're all fucked anyway good luck so what's the plan maybe we should camp
[17919.74s -> 17925.01s]  am I using that right I was supposed to be on the same team look she working
[17925.01s -> 17934.94s]  with another team that was really weird you have blood on your mouth weird I
[17935.10s -> 17940.96s]  don't know about that if it were me if I had blood all over my mouth it'd be like

[17950.32s -> 17980.90s]  camping right now anything to fucking survive man nice oh what I gave oh shit
[17980.90s -> 17996.88s]  it's the um that's that was the broken gun that was the broken gun no I'm not
[17996.88s -> 18004.58s]  getting up such a coward no I have to no no no no no I'll do it I'll do it I'll

[18033.29s -> 18041.93s]  good you took the good gun and didn't even use it oh oh oh man I feel really
[18041.93s -> 18062.50s]  bad I feel awful this is bad I need to redeem myself right now oh thank God
[18062.50s -> 18068.04s]  stream remote okay guys so we got three seconds left and I gotta be honest I'm
[18068.04s -> 18074.39s]  really not so sure what I should do I'm thinking that Gav has experience with
[18074.39s -> 18081.18s]  potential survival skills but tish had a lot of big brain ideas I'm not so
[18081.18s -> 18097.58s]  certain about this though she had some I think she's she's probably to keep the
[18097.58s -> 18121.73s]  smart person tish tish just suspects me oh shit she does you were acting sus
[18121.73s -> 18128.18s]  you've been acting sus towards tish if you save her then she should trust you
[18128.18s -> 18147.78s]  again but tish had a headshot that's right that's right hmm what I feel like
[18147.78s -> 18155.98s]  I haven't heard very much from from Gav in fact people saying who is Gav so just
[18155.98s -> 18164.14s]  because of that I think we have to kill that's it
[18164.14s -> 18175.26s]  yeah yeah that was not the annoying guy it's a good job I followed you down a
[18175.26s -> 18183.00s]  good work on the bridge there you really showed them it's your lucky day
[18185.55s -> 18191.75s]  death the cannibal has cornered his own landing squad
[18198.47s -> 18204.79s]  he did get a headshot that was the deciding factor for me that's what put
[18204.79s -> 18209.15s]  me over the edge I can't I forgot about her arms
[18209.19s -> 18230.90s]  and strangled you with tish led you to the bomb trap though looks like the
[18230.90s -> 18239.70s]  mines they must have figured a way to reuse them oh shit she's injured see
[18239.70s -> 18244.82s]  what happened to the others I didn't see shit I think scarlet went down in the
[18244.82s -> 18254.21s]  shootout though where are we oh thank God we're five miles inland you should
[18254.21s -> 18269.94s]  have stayed with Otto fuck yeah he said he was a camper you okay got louder I
[18269.94s -> 18282.25s]  just turned it over this it kills me turn that off you are too though well if
[18282.25s -> 18286.77s]  somebody wants to decide on taking me over somebody else then you know not to
[18286.77s -> 18291.05s]  take the camper it's great to be part of a real team I think you made the right
[18291.05s -> 18325.63s]  choice Jesus Christ what the fuck stop what's wrong with everybody well now
[18325.63s -> 18345.79s]  you're a star you guys shoot everybody over here sorry shoot everybody zombie
[18345.79s -> 18363.81s]  what the fuck kill stream would like to apologize to scarlet's friends and
[18363.81s -> 18371.35s]  family let's take a moment now in remembrance of her moving on I'm glad I
[18371.43s -> 18407.54s]  got the mature stream warning on this one oh fucking moly that was fucking
[18407.54s -> 18415.16s]  scarring yeah that was fucking horrible like forever changed from that one
[18415.16s -> 18457.75s]  let's stop watching TV actually good effects though not very realistic but
[18457.75s -> 18487.06s]  pretty good I mean it was fucked up how many people are even left on our team
[18487.86s -> 18490.90s]  let's take a breather there's something up ahead
[18490.90s -> 18509.89s]  we please stop playing this um I mean there's only two of us left what what
[18509.89s -> 18525.95s]  what are you looking for you need to tell me what's going on that headcase
[18525.95s -> 18532.31s]  Ari was almost right throw for content I actually have not thrown about that but
[18532.31s -> 18536.87s]  this game is fixed what do you mean winners picked out before the game
[18536.91s -> 18543.89s]  begins how guns are real the mines real how could you possibly stop someone from
[18543.89s -> 18548.30s]  getting killed it's not a sure thing but from what we can tell anything it's
[18548.30s -> 18558.62s]  fake and get them the advantage I'm too speed I'm not here to win tish I've been
[18558.62s -> 18563.82s]  sent here by a group called the Alliance they've sent me here to expose the truth
[18563.82s -> 18569.19s]  that the corporation used deep fake technology to rig the outcome of kill
[18569.83s -> 18572.20s]  with a deep fake stuff
[18590.72s -> 18592.72s]  are they deep faking people dying?
[18599.56s -> 18603.56s]  suits from the contestants estates them with audiences dwindling they had to
[18603.56s -> 18607.96s]  come up with a plan so they started fixing it we're not sure when when the
[18607.96s -> 18612.77s]  creator left their big changes behind the scenes the winners always became big
[18612.77s -> 18617.09s]  all the way up to the top and then all the way to the top man decided to change
[18617.09s -> 18620.85s]  that with the winners in their pockets they managed to keep things afloat for
[18620.85s -> 18624.81s]  a while longer but now they're getting desperate that's why the rules keep
[18624.81s -> 18630.73s]  getting more brutal so you were being serious about the no tap ups they're
[18630.73s -> 18638.46s]  doing it to boost the ratings and the puppet who is it? I'm not sure yet it's him
[18638.46s -> 18645.28s]  sure it's um it's I'm the bad guy probably right it's me who's I talking
[18645.28s -> 18653.51s]  to on the phone before on the walkie-talkie okay it's me it's gonna be
[18653.75s -> 18667.52s]  you're here to expose all of this how why do you be like not bad and send you
[18667.52s -> 18672.46s]  let's just say I have a reason to hate Alan we're all getting deep faked the
[18672.46s -> 18676.74s]  Alliance knew this and it was a safe bet my this is the last thing I'm playing
[18676.74s -> 18681.66s]  before I'm starting streaming they gave me this device payload that I need to
[18681.66s -> 18685.46s]  plant in the corporation's network if they can get in they can hijack the
[18685.46s -> 18691.18s]  stream expose it all the deep fakes the fix everything so why are you telling me
[18691.18s -> 18696.18s]  this why isn't the Alliance helping you it was the notion was up they switched
[18696.18s -> 18699.58s]  locations at the last moment
[18699.58s -> 18706.98s]  last dream ever wait I'm no I'm saying just for today what about GPS our phones
[18706.98s -> 18711.50s]  blocked this signals in and out of this place go through our own corpse network
[18711.94s -> 18716.48s]  we're almost done mice was meant to be an old to their control but the blast
[18716.48s -> 18720.72s]  back there must have knocked it out I need to find a way to our course
[18720.72s -> 18725.08s]  network a calm start maybe I can find a way to get a message out we can find out
[18725.08s -> 18728.92s]  where they're going to kill you gotta be something I didn't say this was bad
[18728.92s -> 18735.56s]  they're streaming from all these drones 24-7 let me see that even if the radio
[18735.56s -> 18741.31s]  is broken you should be able to get some info from the storage I'm not dying on
[18741.31s -> 18749.20s]  this fucking island for nothing why do I trust her we think I don't know I don't
[18749.20s -> 18755.26s]  think so I'm gonna keep hold of it for now they keep just doing the double
[18755.26s -> 18766.73s]  cross thing no okay it's getting dark if there's a predetermined winner it could
[18766.73s -> 18785.11s]  be anyone you have another tower then we know that so what if it's just her we
[18785.11s -> 18788.35s]  should take it in turns keeping watch and tell them to stop cursing please
[18788.35s -> 18794.27s]  toss a coin you're concerned about cursing you sure and there was just like
[18794.27s -> 18798.11s]  a gruesome scene with somebody's like face like blown off I'll have the
[18798.11s -> 18809.99s]  conversation how'd you end up here that's complicated answer why not not
[18809.99s -> 18815.82s]  much call for an aging child actor I didn't make the transition you bleep
[18815.82s -> 18823.68s]  this where's sure TV and film that all changed I will do that for you
[18823.68s -> 18833.66s]  reality kill the TV store you're breaking my heart Mikey you blame the
[18833.66s -> 18848.69s]  corporation for that you remember the other Nick what we're doing on a shelf
[18848.69s -> 18856.73s]  like this Hollywood shoes you up and spit you out what do you do anything you
[18856.73s -> 18863.32s]  can to stay on top I'm waiting I'm trying to get it so he did kill stream
[18863.44s -> 18873.23s]  season 6 it's all starting to make sense drinking drugs made him a different
[18873.23s -> 18880.87s]  person made him feel invincible he thought this was the only way out eat
[18880.87s -> 18897.36s]  fake it is for some of us I'm sorry I didn't mean I wanted to do something for
[18897.36s -> 18912.15s]  my family I wanted to look after that no you didn't want to do that to someone
[18912.15s -> 18921.99s]  tipping the scales add revenue for my channel since I've been in here that's
[18921.99s -> 18936.56s]  gotta be something for them right what do they think of all this told them be
[18936.56s -> 18945.92s]  hard for them to miss by now though oh my god all right this I haven't had a
[18945.92s -> 18951.12s]  complaint about this game until right now this is way too long

[19232.00s -> 19238.23s]  strategy it keeps your kill death high you to enjoy the game you can eat a
[19238.23s -> 19241.45s]  sandwich while you're playing you don't have to have two hands the controller I
[19241.45s -> 19246.67s]  mean that's a pain in the ass what's the difference between this island and a
[19246.67s -> 19259.50s]  dead prostitute Otto hears me saying Otto and is walking over here now hello
[19259.50s -> 19271.86s]  well it's a different auto not you this island still sucks we got a new party
[19271.86s -> 19277.22s]  why don't get is if they can fake bits of it why not fake the whole thing why
[19277.22s -> 19281.47s]  bother going to the expense of hosting it in the first place so let's let's get
[19281.47s -> 19289.43s]  Otto involved here to be variables all the drama power struggles randomness of
[19289.43s -> 19294.95s]  people is hard to script plus I don't know whether you know him but seriously
[19294.95s -> 19299.91s]  cutting you want 50% auto cam 50% game everybody apparently hey man streaming
[19299.91s -> 19303.67s]  that there's just too many people involved but it's an auto can't see this
[19303.67s -> 19308.47s]  shit trust a handful of people at the top to stay quiet they've got the most to
[19308.47s -> 19313.98s]  lose the winner's gonna keep their mouth shut but what about everyone else
[19313.98s -> 19320.90s]  who is it another puppet the winners are you since it was all fake you know he
[19320.90s -> 19324.46s]  really believed it maybe he was onto something maybe it's you mysteriously
[19324.46s -> 19328.78s]  popping up after an explosion one foot in one foot out of the group seems a bit
[19328.78s -> 19334.90s]  suspicious could be anyone he needs something I've got my suspicions hungry
[19334.90s -> 19343.14s]  no you hungry fingers it could be more than one for all we know West I'm gonna
[19343.14s -> 19346.18s]  take them out and give them a little snack and that's where I saw the
[19346.18s -> 19351.06s]  building 50% auto complex my promise has to be something you get to a part where
[19351.06s -> 19357.06s]  I can freeze it there you go all right this is gonna be the last BRB of the
[19357.06s -> 19574.35s]  night I'll be right back and then we'll have a 50% auto cam let's see how the
[19574.35s -> 19615.68s]  auto cam will work auto cam okay if he sits down let's see I don't 50% auto cam
[19622.74s -> 19643.66s]  well you won't you can't see the game okay can you see the game cooking down
[19643.66s -> 19650.46s]  to the final ten who cares about the game this tension with a spoon Nick
[19650.46s -> 19655.83s]  Romeo is still and we think in your party maybe you're still hope maybe the
[19655.83s -> 19662.02s]  pieces is too small but this is strange they're not showing anything bullshit
[19662.02s -> 19669.89s]  fuck is going on the show's really gone downhill oh the show's gone downhill
[19670.09s -> 19675.49s]  that's two clicks West just pass those trees pass the mines we just go get
[19675.49s -> 19680.10s]  through the field isn't there another way around the winds around the islands
[19680.10s -> 19687.70s]  200 meters open ground it gives us an advantage so you're on like a bright red
[19687.70s -> 19692.14s]  blanket how can someone who joined this is way too then suddenly be so risk of
[19692.14s -> 19697.22s]  us it doesn't contrast well at all I don't know it's better than fumbling
[19697.22s -> 19701.33s]  around in the dark just hoping to come across something okay what are our
[19701.33s -> 19708.66s]  options well there's one thing that I think my live auto reaction go on well
[19708.66s -> 19712.02s]  you said those guys use the mines to blow up the bridge yeah that means one
[19712.02s -> 19715.14s]  of those assholes is figured out how to rig those mines to blow up on command
[19715.14s -> 19719.58s]  that means it can be hacked if they can be had to figure out how their arms and
[19719.58s -> 19726.18s]  give it itchy head so what we take a live mine and deactivate always it is
[19726.22s -> 19731.38s]  here that sounds like it's gonna take forever but only for the first one is
[19731.38s -> 19735.94s]  mine's a smart which means it's probably part of a mesh network they send the
[19735.94s -> 19740.82s]  signal to arm disarm from mine to mine if I can figure out how to break one of
[19740.82s -> 19745.82s]  these guys security I can maybe disarm the whole thing at least the area we're
[19745.82s -> 19752.42s]  in wow that sounds like okay then fuckers why don't you go grab a big
[19752.42s -> 19755.62s]  stick and get ready to prod and poke your way through the next 200 meters of
[19755.62s -> 19759.22s]  open ground meter by meter I'm sure there's no risk there at all I haven't
[19759.22s -> 19764.90s]  been paying any attention to this what happened but Otto's plan I don't even I
[19764.90s -> 19767.22s]  don't even know what it is I'm just gonna do it come on then nerd
[19767.22s -> 19771.38s]  it's autos here your mind to play with are you fucking kidding me he's gonna
[19771.38s -> 19778.14s]  blow himself up fuck it I guess he wouldn't be that big of a loss anyway
[19778.14s -> 19782.90s]  whoa whoa whoa what are you doing it's a toes playing I was gonna hat the mine
[19782.90s -> 19788.47s]  I need a computer it's not sending out anything that can track us
[19788.47s -> 19799.07s]  itchy to be dark it's not here itchy it's a year he actually had an ear
[19799.07s -> 19808.21s]  problem I needed to put this stuff in his ears this is a bad idea hey he's okay
[19808.21s -> 19819.12s]  well how do we know if it works well if I walk over here actually the ear for
[19819.12s -> 19824.16s]  him everything within a three meter radius should be disabled you had to get
[19824.16s -> 19829.80s]  this little goo put in both of his ears try it you fucking try it you're holding
[19829.80s -> 19848.11s]  it you're 75% Otto careful wait what if I was gonna go to sleep
[19848.11s -> 19855.47s]  fuck was that holy shit you fucking idiot didn't work oh really and this I
[19855.47s -> 19860.07s]  gave it a go you nearly got us killed not to mention wasted our time in the
[19860.07s -> 19895.22s]  corner we'll have to move fast what's gonna be again keep face doesn't matter
[19895.22s -> 19911.82s]  you step on the mine we're just as dead concentrate 85% Otto 10% movie 5% face
[19911.82s -> 19935.73s]  cam there are those people like aiming at this whole game I'm sorry I got out
[19935.73s -> 19958.89s]  of that alive and I didn't do anything I told you that was gonna happen I
[19958.89s -> 19965.21s]  fucking told oh wait what wrong person it was literally the wrong guy it's the
[19965.21s -> 19972.12s]  other guy don't go anywhere folks we'll be back in
[19972.72s -> 19980.33s]  yo you seen this on the subreddit defects yeah I'm not buying this thing
[19980.33s -> 19983.49s]  that's why Romeo is there
[20004.14s -> 20010.10s]  we've come this far yeah but where I was okay I was about to say I'm gonna walk
[20010.10s -> 20012.70s]  out of the theater but he said we've come this far
[20013.70s -> 20017.70s]  like shit like you they're right
[20017.70s -> 20025.35s]  moving he's not just some glory-seeking wannabe Otto here is convicted of
[20025.35s -> 20031.15s]  swatting another streamer well Otto did not do that no swatting call the cops
[20031.15s -> 20035.39s]  and said there was a hostage situation at the house of another player so they
[20035.39s -> 20046.54s]  would send an armed response and what happened to Otto is killed I didn't mean
[20046.54s -> 20051.74s]  I don't care about anyone's past the fact is we're already in this situation
[20051.74s -> 20056.78s]  and we have to keep going how do we know he's not the puppet how do we know
[20056.78s -> 20062.46s]  you're not the fucking puppet you want a fucking because it's me I'm the main
[20062.46s -> 20068.27s]  character is the puppet it's me what's that I might as well tell them at this
[20068.27s -> 20077.48s]  point shouldn't be out this far come on
[20083.39s -> 20094.56s]  yeah I kind of want to just finish this movie so I can put it back in the
[20094.56s -> 20098.24s]  blu-ray case and just put it in the closet must be close now you know I
[20098.24s -> 20102.68s]  don't want to have it be sitting in my ps4 after I just kind of stop watching
[20102.68s -> 20107.20s]  it you know I mean I it's like I've got to complete it so I can put it in the
[20107.20s -> 20120.55s]  case and put it in the closet all right well okay this is difficult because she
[20120.55s -> 20128.09s]  she woke up earlier before I did and she I don't know what she she like was do
[20128.09s -> 20132.56s]  we sit behind the building and then she's like what huh what and then we
[20132.56s -> 20154.49s]  already like kind of betrayed Otto but then Otto but Otto at low opacity and
[20154.49s -> 20164.46s]  put the stream behind him all right well I'll go with Otto because Otto was the
[20164.46s -> 20171.99s]  dog name and if I don't click Otto then everyone's gonna be pissed you don't
[20171.99s -> 20183.10s]  like that guy you like my dog you like this Otto oh look at him he's so long
[20183.10s -> 20196.51s]  and chunky look at his big chunky butt he's like a seal
[20200.63s -> 20212.76s]  no earlier a phone fell out oh it was switched on yeah sure just before the
[20212.76s -> 20219.29s]  drone came look I know coming from me what if he's making this up here's the
[20219.29s -> 20229.94s]  problem what if he called the drone he's just putting it on her but it's I tell
[20229.94s -> 20233.66s]  we need to confront her dude I think we need to get the fuck out of it we're not
[20233.66s -> 20255.09s]  just ditching her okay is he right oh is he aiming at my head he's oh god he's
[20255.09s -> 20258.41s]  aiming at me oh I thought Otto was aiming at me
[20258.41s -> 20266.18s]  Nick let her go in the spirit of the game now would it I do need you Nick
[20266.18s -> 20272.56s]  you're outnumbered anyway you shoot her we kill you you didn't think I'd come
[20272.56s -> 20280.07s]  alone did you I come the yeah remember us you and me we just need a little chat
[20280.07s -> 20300.20s]  what the hell is going on speedrun 100% auto no I mean didn't I tell you that
[20300.24s -> 20306.14s]  near the end I was gonna have to have a sacrifice but here's the thing what if
[20306.14s -> 20310.26s]  they're baking this up what if they're working together this could just be an
[20310.26s -> 20322.54s]  elaborate ruse this is an elaborate ruse they're working I knew it I told you
[20322.54s -> 20334.70s]  yep what are you doing we need him god damn it I knew it
[20334.70s -> 20348.16s]  no no no worries go I've been looking forward to this we had the root we had
[20348.16s -> 20375.40s]  the redemption arc too okay so now what what is the climax of this whole thing
[20375.40s -> 20449.27s]  right you're just at the beginning your face on autos he's using the webcam okay
[20449.27s -> 20452.47s]  I thought he was just saying he wanted to take a bath I wasn't paying too much
[20452.47s -> 20473.53s]  attention okay so what happens here how does this end the acting that well I
[20473.53s -> 20477.17s]  think it's not even bad was it that was like good acting that wasn't bad
[20477.17s -> 20494.95s]  acting what are you talking about I mean some of the acting is not good is not
[20494.95s -> 20520.28s]  good you think he's a bad actor I think that guy's pretty good I got this so
[20520.28s -> 20523.00s]  wrong I thought this guy was gonna die first and they kept him through the
[20523.00s -> 20555.83s]  whole game like comedy relief guy yeah stealth takedown how do you do a stealth
[20555.83s -> 20576.44s]  takedown if somebody's looking at you I don't know how I got over here what yeah
[20576.50s -> 20599.84s]  search where'd the knife come from I don't remember it was makeup no no I
[20599.84s -> 20612.35s]  don't think so what do you mean it was makeup all right dad it's makeup yeah well
[20612.35s -> 20635.87s]  fast fast fast fast fast really fast oh shit he didn't even say anything but
[20635.87s -> 20686.55s]  what do you have another gun upgrade nice go go get it hurry let's talk we
[20686.55s -> 20695.09s]  can still get on the blur and get this all sorted you awake again okay but
[20695.09s -> 20707.74s]  we're almost there the finale wait what what chance do you think you had you
[20707.74s -> 20715.68s]  fucking muppet see the decisions already be made okay but I'm still alive
[20715.68s -> 20721.76s]  around oh the deep fakes are out there as far as the world knows already dead I
[20721.76s -> 20732.32s]  can easily just show up and be alive they can't let you there will be
[20733.22s -> 20740.76s]  one survivor anyway oh my god I can't believe you just showed that what I
[20740.76s -> 20743.84s]  don't remember that happening everyone gets shot through their right eye by the
[20743.84s -> 20764.26s]  way now what put the gun down tish so we made it to the last two that's not
[20764.26s -> 20769.46s]  true doesn't have to end this what about what about the girl the blood in her
[20769.46s -> 20780.65s]  mouth you just dipped out there are no guarantees what then this right here is
[20780.65s -> 20786.71s]  the ultimate prize Nick that's bullshit you just don't get it do you you may
[20786.71s -> 20792.27s]  have lost your fame your fortune your friend but it's not seven times I never
[20792.27s -> 20798.31s]  had any of that to begin with I came here for my family and now I can have it
[20798.31s -> 20803.83s]  all hell with everyone else you can't change it Nick we gotta look out for
[20803.83s -> 20808.47s]  ourselves there's a better way we can put an end to all this bloodshed you
[20808.47s -> 20814.33s]  were better than this day you don't know me who I am you still have a choice I
[20814.33s -> 20826.48s]  never had a choice Nick don't do it your move fine don't make me do it don't make
[20826.48s -> 20834.08s]  me do it please dish never point a gun at something you don't intend to kill oh
[20834.16s -> 20837.39s]  you didn't tend to kill me okay well never mind
[20837.39s -> 20903.92s]  the broadcast is out you're dead anyway not if I skip the ending cutscene I can
[20903.92s -> 20942.01s]  do my own deep fake chaotic laughter I live nice do I survive that that's
[20942.17s -> 20953.20s]  really bad ending oh it's gonna be after credits it's a battle royale you went by
[20953.20s -> 20963.41s]  didn't win though because they bake the whole thing with CG characters like one
[20963.41s -> 20967.01s]  of the characters was saying earlier what is the point of even doing this
[20967.01s -> 20973.03s]  show if you can just have realistic completely uncanny Valley real people
[20973.03s -> 20989.98s]  CG of people doing this what's the point of doing this in real life that might be
[20989.98s -> 21006.41s]  the worst ending it could be it's probably at least like five endings the
[21006.41s -> 21017.24s]  full-screen auto well hold on not yet in one of the other endings you hack the
[21017.24s -> 21027.23s]  stuff and release the deep fake info okay all right let's get the credits and
[21027.23s -> 21062.16s]  see what happens there's nothing there that it gets it no morale nobody likes
[21062.16s -> 21078.50s]  me nobody loves me but I'm strong and smart I guess no one likes me but I'm
[21078.50s -> 21088.97s]  very strong and very smart okay decisions made 54 scenes view this 294
[21088.97s -> 21101.45s]  scenes holy shit damn okay no romances all right I'm gonna do one thing before
[21101.45s -> 21107.88s]  we go there's a short video I want to watch it's a short sorcery film about
[21107.88s -> 21117.91s]  this stream and the sorcery game but stream is essentially over next time
[21117.91s -> 21122.15s]  I'll be live it will likely be next weekend probably on either Friday or
[21122.19s -> 21130.02s]  Saturday or Sunday keep an eye on the sus likely Sunday either maybe Friday and
[21130.02s -> 21145.37s]  Sunday or maybe just Sunday at Otto first oh I know I'm gonna pet you I'm
[21145.37s -> 21158.93s]  gonna pet mr. Otto you have a scratchy bum do you do you oh my goodness you
[21158.93s -> 21179.72s]  have a scratchy day it's Otto it's Otto it's Otto showing you his
[21179.72s -> 21186.47s]  penguin stripe okay I'm gonna grab this video real quick me one second will I
[21186.47s -> 21193.16s]  grab it but that's gonna conclude essentially the gaming portion of the
[21193.16s -> 21196.96s]  stream and I think this video is like you two three minutes four minutes I'm
[21196.96s -> 21203.81s]  like that those either to have never seen the sorcery playthrough is one of
[21203.81s -> 21210.61s]  the first streams I really did on twitch when I went to quote I'm a streamer now
[21210.61s -> 21244.67s]  when he what 2015 2016 link is okay
[21244.67s -> 21253.19s]  slam the walk turns over behind you hold on don't know it's good look at the
[21253.19s -> 21278.45s]  first grade all right let me get this shit out of here first of all okay all
[21278.45s -> 21296.46s]  right you ready this is called zap the old man a sorcery tribute and here we go
[21296.46s -> 21307.21s]  three the door of the stone building is slammed and the lock turns over behind
[21307.21s -> 21323.04s]  you is this gonna be a better movie a bench against one wall is the only piece
[21323.04s -> 21330.02s]  of furniture where an old man sits we're gonna go talk to it's a better movie
[21330.02s -> 21335.54s]  greetings old man he ignores you he is concentrating hard on something on the
[21335.54s -> 21340.30s]  ground just in front of him you glance upwards to the stars and suddenly the
[21340.30s -> 21346.81s]  old man shouts her sorcerer I knew it you're mistaken you reply cautiously oh
[21346.81s -> 21351.93s]  I don't think so you'll get us out of here better yet I haven't played anyone
[21351.93s -> 21358.93s]  for months silly not anyone smart sit down sit down hey what oh I swindle
[21358.93s -> 21365.01s]  stones of course swindle stones stranger in town don't know how to play better
[21365.65s -> 21370.89s]  he shows you one of his stones it is a strange for value to die he pats the
[21370.89s -> 21378.99s]  bench beside him with one hand shit play we can talk while I beat you this is
[21378.99s -> 21383.71s]  really really well made I'll go first show you how it's done the game is
[21383.71s -> 21390.46s]  simple we roll and bet on what's come up for instance I might start and bet that
[21390.46s -> 21395.66s]  between us we've rolled at least two truth how do I know what you have three
[21395.66s -> 21400.26s]  twos didn't you hear my last bid that was a clue at least unless I'm trying to
[21400.26s -> 21406.34s]  mislead you four twos I think you're trying to sleep oh yeah he had fucking
[21406.34s -> 21411.98s]  two twos so I get the I win when you win a round of swindle stones the other
[21411.98s -> 21416.78s]  person loses a die this game is so good by the way well two ones should do
[21416.78s -> 21423.44s]  therefore 20 years now hold on I need directions three threes oh yes we're
[21423.52s -> 21432.22s]  two four three screamer meta so he loses another die and he's at even more of a
[21432.22s -> 21438.14s]  disadvantage so what do they get you for one one it's a mistake one two oh I
[21438.14s -> 21443.07s]  better watch mine was lifting from a red eye two ones you can't be a very good
[21443.07s -> 21451.01s]  pickpocket then call what do you know about the north gate of the city two
[21451.01s -> 21455.86s]  ones it's wizard locked with a spell normally the first noble knows it two
[21455.86s -> 21461.09s]  fours this is important so tell me everything you know three fours they say
[21461.09s -> 21468.12s]  the spell is four lines and four novels know one line each four fours that's
[21468.12s -> 21476.07s]  good advice call I win don't I there they go that's swindle stones I was
[21476.07s -> 21481.34s]  going easy on you of course rematch thanks for the game I enjoyed being

[21521.22s -> 21532.97s]  green ring zap zap the fucking door cast the spell winding a powerful charge of
[21532.97s -> 21543.50s]  electricity inside your wrist ready to unleash zap the old man no reason to
[21543.50s -> 21548.90s]  listen to this old man's horse breathing what instantly is there the next the
[21548.90s -> 21557.81s]  room is filled with smoke and the smell of cooked bacon that's so fucked up you
[21557.81s -> 21565.71s]  settle down on the bench to wait out the night in silence I would definitely

[21605.06s -> 21611.64s]  fucking unbelievable even the zap in the CG is after effects you know what you're
[21611.64s -> 21622.02s]  doing swindle stones should be the new streamer meta I feel like that would be a
[21622.14s -> 21635.86s]  lot of content thank you for that video that's unbelievable that was by dr.
[21635.86s -> 21656.29s]  Masaki very nice it would just compare it to squid game yeah but not if you had

[21717.49s -> 21725.85s]  don't know I feel like it's it sits in a place for me where I want to preserve
[21725.85s -> 21732.31s]  that I had so much fun it was such a it was so many fun streams in a row that I
[21732.31s -> 21735.83s]  don't want to go back and remake it I feel like it wouldn't be as interesting
[21735.99s -> 21747.22s]  maybe sensory stream yeah I know I got there's a lot of stuff that I'm gonna be
[21747.22s -> 21764.15s]  working on this week maybe I'll go tap into that too that was a lot of fun all
