[2.10s -> 16.18s]  Well, have you guys been just sitting there spelling? I saw T-E. T-E. T-E. T-E. And I realized, oh, it's because half of you were saying T-E, half of you were saying L-A. Right. I see.
[16.18s -> 29.56s]  Well, too many of you guys were doing T-E because that's all I saw. Yes. How are you? I'm not supposed to be here. I'll be right back.
[29.56s -> 66.65s]  Two minutes have to go by before I say a word. Be right back. Two minutes? It's been 12. Yeah, I know.
[67.13s -> 75.56s]  Okay, listen, you guys ever do a thing where you're in the shower and you get you say to yourself,
[76.12s -> 82.36s]  I'm going to give myself 10 minutes, eight minutes to take a shower. Okay, take like just get in there.
[82.36s -> 87.56s]  I'm just going to wash my hair. I'm going to wash my body. I'm going to whistle for 30 seconds,
[87.56s -> 92.20s]  you know, and just sit there in the hot water. You get to the part where you shampoo your hair
[93.35s -> 99.46s]  and then every time limit you gave yourself never existed. After the shampoo goes in,
[99.46s -> 104.07s]  it's almost like you can't count anymore. It's like, all right, shampoo is going in. I got like
[104.71s -> 108.87s]  60 seconds. I can do this in 60. And then everything, it goes blank and you just sit,
[108.87s -> 115.06s]  it's like 15 minutes goes by. And then you realize that you like glitch out as a human. You're like,
[115.06s -> 118.18s]  wait, no, I was supposed to get out of here. I was supposed to get the fuck out of here.
[119.90s -> 127.18s]  Once I get the lather into the hair and I run my head underneath the hot water, it's like a reset
[127.18s -> 133.58s]  button. I don't know if the hot water gets involved in your brain or something. I don't
[133.58s -> 138.12s]  understand. But I've run my head under the hot water and all of a sudden it's like, oh yeah,
[138.12s -> 142.68s]  that's what I like. And now I, now I don't even know what, what was I doing? What was the plan
[142.68s -> 157.37s]  today? So I, I stayed in there for an extra few minutes. Hot water melts his brain. I don't know.
[157.37s -> 164.36s]  It's like, I don't know. Maybe it's like a little, I don't understand. Should I bring that up to the
[164.36s -> 171.30s]  doctor? Yeah. Hey, every time I get like hot water running over my head, I forget, I forget where I
[171.30s -> 180.68s]  am. That doesn't happen. I'm kidding. You promised us eating on stream. Did you, did you, you must
[180.68s -> 189.51s]  have not have watched the stream from three days ago, four days ago. Jeremy, you promised us eating
[189.51s -> 195.48s]  on stream. I did. I did it. I ate the Whopper. I ate the chicken sandwich and I ate the salad,
[196.70s -> 200.06s]  which is the French fries. That counts as a salad, it's potato, it's vegetables.
[200.70s -> 229.77s]  Hold on. I don't like where this mic is. Give me a second. Okay. That's better.
[230.57s -> 235.62s]  Yeah. I didn't like the placement of the mic. It was, it was making me very angry.
[238.58s -> 241.62s]  All right. So what we're going to do today, we're going to go back to Jedi Academy,
[243.69s -> 249.53s]  going to finish it. I have one more chapter left and then we have to discuss how the next
[249.53s -> 254.41s]  three or four weeks are going to play out. Those of you that have been on this channel for the last
[254.41s -> 264.23s]  year or longer know that 2020 was supposed to have about two or three very major streams in it.
[265.70s -> 272.84s]  I ran into some medical problems in 2020 and obviously the coronavirus fucked up everything,
[272.84s -> 280.31s]  right? So a ton of those streams that were supposed to happen in 2020 have been moved
[280.31s -> 289.35s]  into 2021. So the theory is over these, the baseball stream comes to mind. That's the number
[289.35s -> 298.65s]  one, big one. The theory is that in the first quarter here, we will do a couple of really big
[298.65s -> 309.38s]  streams. The theory here. So over the next few weeks, cause we're already into January and it's
[309.38s -> 314.79s]  like, oh shit, it's already January. It's already almost middle of January. So I need to take some
[314.79s -> 321.94s]  time to make sure that these big streams are going to be ready to go. We've got, I didn't
[321.94s -> 329.11s]  forget. People think I forget the 30 webcam stream. That's going to happen soon. The 30
[329.11s -> 332.79s]  webcam stream is not going to happen in like six months. That's going to happen like probably in
[332.79s -> 342.78s]  the next like 45 days. So we're working on that. That's like the next one. That's the first one
[342.78s -> 349.37s]  you'll probably see. Baseball stream is going to be after that. So we're going to really try to get
[349.37s -> 356.98s]  that to happen, but it requires a little bit of time. So streams are going to be kind of sporadic
[357.06s -> 363.86s]  here over the next three or four weeks. While a bunch of work is done on these various streams,
[367.86s -> 373.78s]  your 1080 is going to fry. That's another thing. I'm glad. Hey, thank you. Not a plant for bringing
[373.78s -> 379.14s]  this up. I have, I'm doing the new computer is happening like over these next three to five
[379.14s -> 384.02s]  weeks. So I'm getting a new computer. I'm going to upgrade this computer. There's a lot of, I,
[384.82s -> 391.43s]  I'm stupid and I can't do anything. So I need help. Good luck getting a GPU.
[392.15s -> 401.03s]  Don't worry. I'll get one. We've been, you've been saying that we've been saying that shit for like
[401.03s -> 409.88s]  the last four and a half months. I have to get one. So I'm going to be building a new streaming PC.
[412.26s -> 416.18s]  I'm doing that. This is just kind of, I've got some friends that I want to hang out with.
[418.52s -> 425.90s]  No, I've got, I've got to go. I've got to go visit italics. It's been like six months since
[425.90s -> 433.78s]  I've last seen that guy. No, this is a lot going on and streams are going to be a little
[433.78s -> 444.31s]  sporadic here over the next three or four weeks. So we will go from there. I'll give you a good idea.
[447.48s -> 460.78s]  He's your friend? Yes, he is. Pour milk into the GPU. All right. We, all right. Thanks for the tip.
[460.78s -> 466.70s]  I appreciate it. I don't have, it's not here yet. So you're like, you're like three and a half weeks
[466.70s -> 475.02s]  early with that one. The bird watching stream. That's another one. The plan is for me and my
[475.02s -> 480.38s]  manager, some of you know, the producer of a lot of these events that have happened,
[480.38s -> 485.34s]  we're going to just block out a shitload of stuff to do in the first two quarters of 2021.
[486.22s -> 492.82s]  Some of them are already done and they just need to be streamed. But now is the time for that stuff
[492.82s -> 504.54s]  to happen. So all this long winded thing is for me to tell you, break Andy's taking another break.
[510.82s -> 514.78s]  No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm not taking another break. I'm kidding.
[515.42s -> 520.89s]  But you'll probably see maybe like a couple of streams a week for the next three or four weeks.
[520.89s -> 528.14s]  I'm not taking another, I'm kidding. I thought I looked at the, uh, like the calendar of streams
[528.86s -> 533.74s]  that I've done and I'm like, Oh, how many streams have I done over the last like month or two?
[534.46s -> 540.46s]  And it's like, Oh, right. I took like all the holidays off because that was like 10 days off.
[540.46s -> 544.94s]  And then like, Oh, the time to go break, break Andy again, like another 10, like doing 15, 20 days
[544.94s -> 552.06s]  off. Oh, I mean, that's like, like, I mean, I, I can't do that. So no, I'm not going to do that.
[553.00s -> 559.51s]  You'll see a couple of streams a week until we get a solid sort of foundation on everything.
[560.47s -> 570.50s]  But I am insanely excited for 2021. The baseball stream is ready to go. We just need a date and
[570.50s -> 578.10s]  we need the venue to be ready. That's it. We've ever, it's ready to go. We were ready to go
[579.08s -> 584.31s]  back in August, but we had to stop it two weeks before the event was going to happen.
[584.95s -> 590.81s]  We had to pull the plug on it because there was a huge spike in COVID and we just couldn't,
[590.81s -> 596.12s]  we just were like, this is not something we can do right now. It was back in that period where
[596.12s -> 604.63s]  it was just a major, major spike in like every major city in America. So over these next three
[604.63s -> 613.82s]  to five months, we'll see. We're hoping that we can get it done. How about right now? It's worse
[613.82s -> 618.54s]  now. Well, we're not doing it now. Oh, you can hear Star Wars. You're not supposed to hear Star
[618.54s -> 628.86s]  Wars yet. We're not doing it like tomorrow, but to do a, to do a major stream like this in like
[628.86s -> 635.96s]  April, we need to make sure that it's ready in January, in February. You know, it's got to,
[635.96s -> 639.24s]  we have to, you can't just like, you can't just like in April, like be like, Hey, it's time to go,
[639.24s -> 651.48s]  go, let's do the stream. These things take time later today. When's the hacker stream? Well,
[657.75s -> 662.63s]  just, I've, there's, that was going to happen. It was, I think it was a little back and forth.
[662.63s -> 671.48s]  I had to do with, with Twitch to make sure that like, I could do that. There was a little back
[671.48s -> 677.93s]  and forth. We're still kind of, I'm going to figure that out. God damn it. Stop like pulling
[678.01s -> 685.03s]  a truck into my driveway. There we go. When is the, no, no. When's the bathtub stream?
[692.90s -> 696.82s]  Illegal streams are the best streams. Illegal streams are also what they're called illegal
[696.82s -> 701.32s]  because then I get in trouble. And then what do you want me to do? I need to do an illegal.
[701.96s -> 708.78s]  Stop playing trumpets in my fucking garage. Stop doing that. Stop playing. Just leave me alone.
[714.70s -> 719.58s]  And the cat boy stream. That's another one. We look, there's going to be a shitload of streams
[719.58s -> 725.40s]  in 2021. A ton of them had to get pushed from 2020. Like I said, so it's just like we got,
[725.40s -> 730.98s]  we got double time to do. That's what I got to say. Long story short, after today's stream,
[730.98s -> 737.35s]  I'll see you in like four days. Four day break Andy. All right, let's go. That was such a long
[737.35s -> 744.34s]  winded way for me to say, I'll see you guys on, that was an insanely long winded way for me to say,
[745.22s -> 754.34s]  I'll see you on Thursday or Friday. And oh my God, that's another one. We have,
[754.34s -> 760.34s]  there's a huge Minecraft server that's being worked on and it's awesome. It's fucking awesome.
[760.34s -> 765.38s]  You have no idea how awesome this is. You have no idea how, how fun this is going to be.
[766.97s -> 773.67s]  Not FTK. It's just a Minecraft server. It's just Germacraft. You guys are going to love it. I've
[773.67s -> 782.65s]  seen so much of it already. No mazes. I promise. There's a look. We, we, we, I don't hurt my hand.
[782.65s -> 790.65s]  We got a lot going on in 2021. Let's fucking go. Anyways, you guys, you can play the trumpets
[790.65s -> 797.06s]  again if you want. We're going to continue our Sith training. We, oh wait, wait, let's give some
[797.06s -> 803.93s]  context here. Uh, the context is, uh, we're, we're like about to fight a, we're about to fight a
[803.93s -> 809.98s]  monster. It's way too loud. Those of you that missed the last stream from two days ago,
[809.98s -> 816.07s]  we were in the middle of fighting the, uh, the, the rancid monster. I haven't even used this new,
[816.07s -> 823.21s]  I made this new lightsaber. All right. Well, hold on. I need his help. What was the goal of this?
[824.44s -> 830.84s]  Holy shit. That jump. Don't eat him. Don't eat him. Don't eat him. Don't eat him. Please don't eat
[830.84s -> 847.46s]  him. Like what? Holy shit. What? Wait, was he giving me like a chance? It's so loud. Hold on.
[850.58s -> 855.21s]  All right. Is it loud for you? It's really loud for me. I mean an intruder.
[855.77s -> 868.55s]  I forgot I had that move. Right. I forgot. I forgot I was unbeatable.
[869.35s -> 876.84s]  Then what do I have to do? Just lure him away. Oh shit. Oh, you also got force lightning, don't
[876.84s -> 885.96s]  you? Oh, I see. Somebody else also has a fucking lightning tool in Premiere Pro. Oh, fuck you.
[886.68s -> 900.41s]  It's on easy. No, it's not. Wait, maybe it is. No, it isn't. Oh, hold on. He's spitting acid at us.
[902.82s -> 915.10s]  Wait, why is he just puking? What do I do? What should I do? I'm gonna go this way.
[919.54s -> 934.15s]  Press this button. Press this button. What the fuck? Wait, hey. There's a button I can press
[934.15s -> 944.90s]  here, but I can't activate it. Why? Oh, here we go. Oh, wait. It's a crane. It's picking up. Is
[944.90s -> 951.35s]  it gonna drop it on his head? All right. I'm gonna drop this on his head. We're gonna anvil this guy
[951.35s -> 964.82s]  like Looney Tunes. All right. Now it's I guess that gives me an opportunity. Should I go that way?
[965.54s -> 976.63s]  What the fuck are you doing here? All right. So now if I walk him over here,
[977.19s -> 986.42s]  do these things matter? What do these things do? They are. I'm gonna. All right. You're gonna
[986.42s -> 995.40s]  turn into a fucking pinball. There goes his fucking head. There goes his head. There goes. Oh,
[995.40s -> 1009.40s]  my God. I cut his whole. Wait, why is this? Holy shit. I'm fucking out of here. All right.
[1009.40s -> 1021.48s]  So just remember what works now. Cool. What is it? This one. Did I? Oh, I just instantly
[1021.48s -> 1029.82s]  killed that guy. There's a lot of reverse Jedi here. If you wait, I have a question for you guys.
[1029.82s -> 1036.57s]  Star Wars lore heads. If you have a red lightsaber, does that automatically mean you are a Sith?
[1038.04s -> 1046.06s]  Can you have red lightsabers just because you like the color red? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. But what if
[1046.06s -> 1050.94s]  you just like put like red Sith? What if you just have like Sith food coloring or something?
[1051.66s -> 1056.22s]  Does that could you do that? If you had an orange lightsaber and you like just kind of died the
[1056.22s -> 1062.02s]  like just added a red light into it or something. He's still bad. What if you just like the color
[1062.02s -> 1074.97s]  red? I did not kill him in the air. Come on. That's bullshit that you are fucked up. Okay.
[1074.97s -> 1096.18s]  What? So you're fucked up if you like the color red. What happened to me? I like the color red.
[1096.18s -> 1103.56s]  Therefore, I'm evil. No, but hold on. We've got an all capitals lore master here. This is all
[1103.56s -> 1109.02s]  capitals. They were very upset about this. No, but depending on which lore context it is,
[1109.02s -> 1112.30s]  there is a certain process required to make your lightsaber crystal red,
[1112.30s -> 1117.26s]  which only a Sith would do. So you probably wouldn't have a red lightsaber in that context.
[1117.26s -> 1123.10s]  Otherwise, if it's just a normal crystal, then yeah, it's basically team colors. But red is
[1123.10s -> 1131.93s]  only for the Sith team where the Jedi get like six. Okay. So, okay. What if I had the the kyber
[1131.93s -> 1139.27s]  crystal that was in front that was orange and then I had like a red led that I got from Home
[1139.27s -> 1146.46s]  Depot on top like in front of it to make it like a red tint. Does this does that make me an evil
[1146.46s -> 1165.86s]  person? Am I a bad guy? Why? What's with Jedi's in the color red? Then get ready to be sliced up by
[1165.86s -> 1174.58s]  a Jedi for having a Sith lightsaber. I can't stop it. All right. Where do I go from here? Over here.
[1176.46s -> 1180.78s]  That was I just gonna do it was like hey, that's not so you fall damage. Yeah, I'm gonna say.
[1181.90s -> 1188.82s]  All right, let's go this way. How about we just power this guy? Yep, get powered. All right.
[1189.38s -> 1197.00s]  No. All right, slice them. No more dismemberment, by the way. It happened for like one second.
[1197.00s -> 1203.42s]  We got to cut one guy's head off. All right, watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[1208.10s -> 1215.61s]  I just goomba stomped it. All right, go, go, go, go. Here he comes. Oh my god. Here comes the rancor.
[1218.54s -> 1234.98s]  Hey, look. There's a guy coming behind. Look at the guy with the two sabers. It's like oh my god.
[1234.98s -> 1240.60s]  This is my chance. This is my chance. Can I get him? Can I slice his leg off? He's laughing at us.
[1251.90s -> 1259.69s]  Do something. Attack. Nice keyboard turn, rancor. Now we know who paid for their account.
[1260.33s -> 1283.66s]  Oh, he's dead. Okay. All right, don't get killed. I think I have like realistic lightsabers on too,
[1283.66s -> 1295.14s]  right? Is that why I'm getting killed in one hit? I can't stop it. Basically, yeah, okay.
[1295.86s -> 1298.55s]  But why even fight anything if the rancor is just going to kill everybody?
[1302.90s -> 1307.38s]  We could just have like, look, their AI range is only that far and then they just get...
[1307.38s -> 1313.30s]  Thank you. Yeah, nice try. Look, their AI range only goes so far and then eventually the rancor
[1313.30s -> 1328.06s]  is just going to kill them. So why am I even wasting my time? I don't. He can't fit through
[1328.06s -> 1336.66s]  this door. Can he? He just sneaks his head under here. All right, no, dismemberment's still on.
[1337.38s -> 1351.59s]  I think he just ate somebody. What? I'm trying to lead him in here. What am I doing? Oh, you idiot.
[1352.39s -> 1364.84s]  All right, get in here. I don't know why. I figured if I led them in there he would just
[1364.84s -> 1373.05s]  kill them instantly, but he killed me instantly. What an idiot. I don't even fight them. Just go.
[1373.77s -> 1391.42s]  Let's press left and right click at the same time. Is that this guy's internal monologue?
[1395.11s -> 1407.13s]  What? Why did we just get a narrator? All right. Oh, how did he get in here? What? Um, I would love
[1407.13s -> 1420.06s]  it if I could click this button. Oh my god, he doesn't stop during the cutscene. Come on.
[1422.26s -> 1426.42s]  It's on easy. It's not on easy. You can't change difficulty unless you reload a whole new video
[1426.42s -> 1446.20s]  game. What should I do? Checkpoint. Oh, all right. Wait, does he just have to press a button here?
[1446.84s -> 1456.86s]  Am I safe in here? I don't think he can do anything. No, there's a huge window right here
[1456.86s -> 1478.36s]  he can come through, but can he come through it? Yes, apparently. I guess he can. Sure. Touch it.
[1478.36s -> 1487.10s]  Touch it. Now what does that do? Maybe I can trap it between those containers and the door.
[1488.94s -> 1512.52s]  Uh, okay. I don't trap it between the containers and the door. Like, he wants me to trap him right
[1512.52s -> 1520.30s]  there? Just squish his head on it? But how do I? He needs to be standing there. All right, hold on.
[1524.18s -> 1537.91s]  Okay, come on over to this side. Over here. Get over here. Stop. He's stuck in the door.
[1542.39s -> 1548.95s]  Well, I think that guy's dead. He's stuck in the wall. I think if I turn him around, I think this.
[1549.67s -> 1563.72s]  All right, come on. Oh, you idiot. You eat me. I'm gonna be so fucking mad. All right, come on.
[1565.16s -> 1576.34s]  Get over here. It's so many slashes on him. There we go. All right, I cut his arm. Here we go. Now,
[1576.34s -> 1587.32s]  ready? Here we go. Give me the indicator. Give me the indicator. Give me the fucking. I just
[1587.32s -> 1601.43s]  stabbed myself with my own blade. Oh my god. Isn't this the thing that comes down right here?
[1601.99s -> 1620.98s]  Super speed. Another console right here. Oh, he's in slow motion. All right. Um,
[1621.78s -> 1635.35s]  how's this a secret area? What? All right, then lead him back here and then press it when he
[1635.35s -> 1661.29s]  gets right there. All right, press it. What the fuck? Wrong computer. What do you mean?
[1662.09s -> 1679.51s]  There's a button on here inside the room. Yeah, I dig to get. I can't get the indicator never
[1679.51s -> 1692.70s]  shows up. All right. Where you here? Ramp. What the fuck is this place? Oh my god. He just instantly
[1692.70s -> 1707.99s]  killed me. Yeah, it's going to go. Maybe I can look and stop his head between those containers
[1707.99s -> 1723.98s]  and the door. Yeah, maybe I can fucking trap him. Wouldn't this be horrible to fight in a hallway
[1723.98s -> 1734.73s]  like this? You had a double sided lightsaber. Can you only fight in an open area? He's fucking
[1734.73s -> 1768.22s]  head off. Come on. Oh my god. Oh my god. This guy's unbeatable. I got also used to it doesn't
[1768.22s -> 1781.70s]  matter. Okay, he's gone. Save it. Why would I just spin it around in a circle in front of you?
[1782.42s -> 1792.47s]  Like a baton. Just spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin and walk forward. Okay, here we go.
[1793.19s -> 1817.05s]  I got him. I get him. I feel like I cut my own head off. That's when you start when you're really
[1817.05s -> 1822.25s]  trying to struggle to learn to do yo-yo tricks. And you sort of lose control when you do like
[1822.25s -> 1827.37s]  around the world and you kind of you cringe your face up and you go and you mouth purses and you
[1827.37s -> 1840.31s]  just wait for the yo-yo to hit you in the head. Yeah, that's what happened. All right, let's get
[1840.31s -> 1857.88s]  him. Oh no. What? He's waiting for his cue? Why didn't he jump over it? He's like, oh shit,
[1857.88s -> 1864.63s]  I'm not in place. I gotta get into my theater manager's gonna be so mad at me. I wasn't where
[1864.63s -> 1883.78s]  I was supposed to be. He missed it. He missed his cue. It's okay. It was still a great
[1883.94s -> 1891.18s]  scene. I've been tracing Tavian's movements over the past few months. It looks like she acquired
[1891.18s -> 1901.16s]  the scepter from a collector on Kama, then she killed him. All right. Okay, cult sighting,
[1901.16s -> 1911.54s]  force theft, dismantle, or weapon destruction. Which one? What do you think? You have force powers
[1911.54s -> 1923.94s]  other than lightning, but do they matter? Do the cult? We've received word from the chandrillians
[1923.94s -> 1929.14s]  that some cultists have broken into an ancient tomb that is supposedly the burial site of a Jedi
[1929.14s -> 1940.66s]  knight. Hurry there and stop them from siphoning that force power. He's lowering the volume a
[1940.66s -> 1951.53s]  little. Sorry, I just cut off Luke. And what are you guys talking about? I have more powers? Look,
[1951.53s -> 1962.70s]  I'm already decked out. Gonna collect his force power. Yeah, wait, what is this one? Jedi mind
[1962.70s -> 1972.02s]  trick. Get rage, please. Force rage. Jedi is protected against 50% of all damage, has stronger
[1972.02s -> 1977.62s]  attacks, and cannot die. Oh, why didn't I get this first? However, the Jedi loses health rapidly,
[1977.62s -> 1982.10s]  must wait for 10 seconds after the rage before it could be used again. The Jedi must have at least
[1982.10s -> 1991.90s]  25 health to use this. Okay, I like the rocket launcher and I like the sniper rifle. I don't
[1991.90s -> 2001.70s]  even know if those are the two things I picked. It's been two days, I forget. Okay, let me key
[2001.70s -> 2018.36s]  bind these. Okay, heal, rip, lightning, drain, rage. Okay, rage is going to be R, rage. Drain
[2018.36s -> 2029.10s]  is going to be, um, I don't know, zero? No, what should it be? G? T? Okay, T. I'm never going to
[2029.10s -> 2041.88s]  use it. So that's the rage power. All right, cool. How do I turn it off? I turn it off.
[2043.06s -> 2059.32s]  I have one HP? What the fuck? All right, how do I get out of here? I don't even- what was that? Who
[2059.32s -> 2064.55s]  was that guy? Who was that guy? All right, well, I don't- sorry.
[2080.90s -> 2086.36s]  Off his head goes. Off his head goes. That's not what it is. It's off with his head.
[2116.28s -> 2124.12s]  He's not quite gone. There he goes. It's me, the Jedi. I'm here to save the day.
[2124.92s -> 2132.95s]  Hold on just a second. Oh, that's- I thought you guys were just two regular, like, henchmen.
[2133.75s -> 2150.65s]  Oh, you are. Okay, that guy's dead. Oh shit, you blocked. Oh, see you later. They go all of his
[2150.65s -> 2155.13s]  body parts too. You have to just watch your body fall. You have to watch your legs fall from your
[2155.13s -> 2171.91s]  torso. Man, that's a horrible way to go. Darth Maul. Well, I mean, Darth Maul has this, but it's
[2171.91s -> 2175.67s]  red. I'm not allowed to have red, apparently. Even if I like the color red, I can't just add a
[2175.67s -> 2188.73s]  little bit of red LED. That makes me a bad person. These are ball breaking. Holy shit. I want to
[2188.73s -> 2199.98s]  ricochet this back at him. Do you think he'd keep shooting? I don't know if I would. You know what?
[2199.98s -> 2208.65s]  I would probably pick up a rock. It would be probably harder for me to hit a rock back at him.
[2209.21s -> 2221.74s]  He had a family. Yeah, he also had an opportunity to stop shooting. I wouldn't have killed this guy.
[2221.74s -> 2225.02s]  If he just put his gun down, I was like, all right. I just thought his head came off.
[2225.66s -> 2228.70s]  If he put his gun down, I was like, all right, I'm going to leave. I'd be like, all right,
[2228.70s -> 2245.96s]  go ahead and leave. Go ahead, get up. Point blank. This has got to feel real bad right now.
[2247.30s -> 2277.43s]  Come on. Point blank. No, stop bouncing that high. I'm sorry. I can't? Are you sure?
[2278.07s -> 2291.14s]  I thought I could go down. Is this going to hurt? Well, he had just missed it by a few feet.
[2292.94s -> 2307.98s]  Too bad. It was a good attempt though. I just heard another one. What was that one for? What
[2307.98s -> 2327.00s]  did that one do? I don't know. I don't know. I guess we'll never know. All right, here we go.
[2327.00s -> 2332.98s]  Save it. I haven't saved it once. Saber color one. Wait, Jeremy, you can change your saber color
[2332.98s -> 2340.26s]  with the console commands. You moron, you absolute buffoon. You missed the reference.
[2340.26s -> 2344.66s]  It was a reference to how Darth Maul died and you missed it. Embarrassing reference. I just saw the
[2344.66s -> 2352.97s]  word Darth Maul because I have to. All right, wait. Saber color in console to change the color.
[2353.96s -> 2367.80s]  Really? That doesn't work. I guarantee you that's a lie. This is a lie. It has to be, right? Yeah,
[2367.80s -> 2389.93s]  it's a lie. What is that? Okay. You guys, come on. I hate when they do that. It's not fair.
[2390.65s -> 2411.98s]  All right, let's do left click, right click. Wait, I have a better idea. Just come over here.
[2413.50s -> 2423.29s]  No, it's not. You don't do a cartwheel to avoid my attacks up here, man. That's a bad idea.
[2424.17s -> 2446.92s]  That was me pretending to know what I was doing. What was that? Hold on. Oh, it's the thing that
[2446.92s -> 2454.12s]  he does in the movie. It's the guaranteed way to die in real life if you ever did this with a weapon.
[2457.29s -> 2466.25s]  The little flourish. Now, your head is off. Imagine that back in the medieval times when
[2466.25s -> 2469.29s]  people actually using weapons like this. They allowed each other to dance around
[2470.73s -> 2476.14s]  for five seconds. No. No, it was brutal and horrible. If there was an opportunity,
[2476.14s -> 2492.73s]  that sword's going right through your stomach. It would be brutal. Holy shit. Hold on. Wait a
[2492.73s -> 2519.80s]  second. Let me do this first. I'm trying to kill him with it. All right. Finally, we got a raid.
[2519.80s -> 2527.22s]  We did. Oh shit, we did. This is from Daleks. Thanks to the raid, Daleks. Hope we had a good
[2527.22s -> 2532.42s]  stream. Whatever it was. Hey, you may have been playing Jedi Force Academy. If you were playing
[2532.42s -> 2549.70s]  Jedi Force Academy, then good for you. Welcome, guys. Is that a kyber crystal over there? Is
[2549.70s -> 2563.53s]  this like a kyber crystal dungeon? Can I make that jump? Of course I can. I'm a Jedi. No raid song.
[2570.23s -> 2580.41s]  There it is. It's a raid song. This place is confusing. Step them from dissecting the tomb.
[2580.41s -> 2606.68s]  Okay. Where should I go? The flourish. He just gets lost. So he started dancing around.
[2609.77s -> 2623.48s]  Wait, hold on. Dance up. I literally... No, I did the Super Mario thing where you jump
[2624.04s -> 2629.00s]  and you're terrified and you're panicked about missing a jump. You land the jump, but then go
[2629.72s -> 2633.96s]  and jump again when you're right on the edge of the first jump that you actually made.
[2633.96s -> 2649.70s]  So I'm sorry. This is the wrong way. There we go. That's what I wanted to do. I'm going back.
[2660.31s -> 2663.75s]  You killed... Where you killed those guys? Isn't it... Yeah, it was back here, right?
[2664.74s -> 2694.86s]  Yeah. I'm not on like a two or three second delay, am I again? What do I go from here? Check. Check.
[2694.86s -> 2706.89s]  All right. Ready? I'm going to clap and you tell me when you hear the clap. Wow, that's actually
[2706.89s -> 2710.95s]  kind of long. Why is that long? It should be like three seconds. Why is it like seven or eight?
[2711.51s -> 2721.53s]  Well, I'm going to do it again. I don't think you guys are ready for it. Why is that long today?
[2721.53s -> 2735.43s]  All right. Well, I got to go up there. Up there. There's something I can do up there. There's like
[2735.43s -> 2741.18s]  an orange thing up there. You're ignoring us. Oh, what are you talking about? I'm not ignoring
[2741.18s -> 2758.17s]  you guys. What are you talking about? What are you guys talking about? Here we go. Okay. Shit. Check
[2758.17s -> 2763.90s]  the doors in the chamber. Is this going to fall damage kill me? Holy shit, it almost did if I
[2763.90s -> 2774.25s]  didn't heal. I cannot read entire coffee pasta. The chat's going too fast, dude. How am I supposed
[2774.25s -> 2788.90s]  to do that? Oh, I see it. What? What happened? There's no enemies in this room. There's no bombs
[2788.90s -> 2807.69s]  or traps are in this room. That doesn't make any sense at all. What actually happened though?
[2807.69s -> 2815.30s]  The screen started shaking. Was the rancor back? Okay. Now let's force push. Electric lightning
[2815.30s -> 2836.01s]  attack. Swing. Pull. Oh, I opened it. All right. Cool. Does my screen look all weird? Yellow saber
[2836.01s -> 2841.32s]  is underpowered. They don't have, it's, it's who, it's who's wielding it, not who's fucking, what
[2842.04s -> 2864.17s]  power level it is. It's just a bright beam of hot light. That's all that is. Oh my god, dude.
[2864.17s -> 2875.11s]  Well, apparently I'm not telling yourself that. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Look, I can go to single
[2875.11s -> 2879.67s]  too. I'm going to try that. I'd rather, I'm going to, I'm going single for now. Let's see.
[2880.55s -> 2905.59s]  Get high rage mode coming in. He choked me to death. Get over here. Yes. Let the rage
[2905.59s -> 2916.94s]  flow through you young master padawan. Let the rage fuel you. Holy shit. Where did you come from?
[2921.78s -> 2953.26s]  Time to add a second blade. Okay. No more fucking around. Get over here. It's in slow motion.
[2954.22s -> 2966.14s]  Why was it in fast? Why was that in fast motion? All right. Now it's my turn. Fuck off. Get out
[2966.14s -> 2973.50s]  of here. Somebody just gave a shitload of money. That's 69 community subs from zap. That's 69
[2973.50s -> 2979.99s]  community subs. The funny, the funny number. That's a huge amount of substitute. Thank you.
[2979.99s -> 2992.55s]  That's insane. Insane. Oh, come on. You got to be fucking kidding me. I just want to kick a guy off
[2992.55s -> 3024.23s]  the edge. Okay. Well that worked. Wait a minute. Hmm. That's how you get that shit done. What about
[3024.23s -> 3034.15s]  you? Can I take you out with a blaster rifle? No, no, no, no, no. Did he just launch those back at
[3034.15s -> 3059.93s]  me? Holy shit. How are you doing that? Where'd he go? All right. Okay. Oh my God. I just fucking
[3059.93s -> 3113.21s]  annihilated this guy. Oh, I didn't have full health. Right. Nice flourish. What am I supposed to do? I
[3113.21s -> 3150.94s]  don't know. Fucking kill him. Watch out. Watch this guy strong. Back it up. Let go of me. Let go.
[3150.94s -> 3173.50s]  Got him. Okay. I did it. Use force push. It's so weak. It doesn't work on people. I can't. Can I
[3173.50s -> 3188.30s]  force choke from all the way back here? How do I get over there? Okay. I'm gonna. I can just jump.
[3188.86s -> 3214.92s]  Can't I? I pressed it. I got it. Let's kill this guy first. When they're two. What the fuck are you
[3214.92s -> 3230.84s]  doing? I know what that's like though. I know what that's like dude. It's fucking hard to keep you
[3230.84s -> 3239.48s]  footing. You could have just stepped down. Okay. Let's go. There was. I've been there before. Plenty
[3239.48s -> 3274.86s]  of times. Okay. So from here, we're going to go this way. Dave, Jeremiah. I got it. Both of us
[3274.86s -> 3304.12s]  clearly have no idea what the fuck we're doing. Like it's very clear. Hey, he died twice. Okay.
[3304.12s -> 3319.08s]  We're going to go over. Easy. Where do I go from here? I go up this way down. I mean, I feel like
[3319.08s -> 3326.73s]  I have to go down there, but I have to go that way. Okay. Hold on. F8 for the fart and burp mechanic.
[3326.73s -> 3346.41s]  It's real. Oh, cool. Let me press it. Can you imagine if they actually added that?
[3356.42s -> 3360.97s]  This place is amazing. It seems like it goes on forever.
[3361.86s -> 3370.39s]  Don't be so stupid. F8. F8. F8. That's the fucking stupidest thing ever.
[3373.51s -> 3377.11s]  Why would they add that? That's like, it doesn't make any sense. The Jedi's even like.
[3377.75s -> 3382.01s]  How am I going to get down there without breaking my neck?
[3382.01s -> 3392.65s]  How am I going to get down there without breaking my neck? Get to full health and jump and hope it
[3392.65s -> 3415.78s]  doesn't kill you. Don't land on your neck, Omega Lul. Okay. Yeah. We can do rage. Oh,
[3416.34s -> 3445.61s]  oh my God. I have no health. Oh, no, don't do it. I'm okay. Got it. Okay. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy.
[3445.61s -> 3459.11s]  Easy. Easy. I had no force power left. That was bad. Let's just snipe this guy. What did he hit
[3459.11s -> 3495.34s]  his head? What? How did he do that? That was weird. Did I do this wrong? Oh shit. This is bad. No,
[3495.34s -> 3524.65s]  hold on. I think I might be in trouble. I jumped all the way down here and I don't think I was
[3524.65s -> 3563.67s]  supposed to do that. Can I make it up on the bridge? I see. Not soft locked. Two at the same time.
[3563.67s -> 3579.29s]  A Jedi's worst nightmare. Oh, just barely have your footing. That was a smart move but it didn't
[3579.29s -> 3607.54s]  work out for you. New objective. Why is my game slowing down? Are they letting me in? Okay.
[3608.10s -> 3615.61s]  Fuck you guys. I'm just going in the chamber. Get out of my fucking way.
[3619.69s -> 3625.45s]  There's one guy sitting in the middle. I feel like he's strongest. He is. He's got the double.
[3625.45s -> 3632.15s]  Okay. What's in the... Should I go in here? Oh, wait. They're desecrating. All right. Stop
[3632.15s -> 3662.09s]  desecrating. This is the same guy. Oh, my God. All right. All of you get in here. I was going to do
[3662.09s -> 3673.98s]  that to you. Stop. I want to do something to you guys. Stop. I just cut that guy's lightsaber in
[3673.98s -> 3693.59s]  half. Wait. I'm deflecting their lightsabers back at them? Jump. Oh, shit. They're all working
[3693.59s -> 3717.56s]  together. That guy got impatient. Let's see. I want to test their patience. These are the
[3717.56s -> 3723.67s]  Sith Ritz brothers. Holy shit. He made it. No, he didn't. He was just showing me he could.
[3731.78s -> 3736.66s]  Okay. But wait. If they deflect it, won't it? They just instantly fucking deflect.
[3736.66s -> 3744.23s]  Instantly. It doesn't matter. Look. I shot it in the fucking air. It doesn't even matter. Watch
[3744.23s -> 3764.01s]  this. Give me... Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Oh, you weren't even there. You weren't even there.
[3764.01s -> 3769.77s]  You weren't even in the right spot. Unbelievable. All right. I'm done. I'm done. This is where you
[3769.77s -> 3790.81s]  die. You're all going to die. Let go. That's so unfair. Let fucking go of me. Force push. Force
[3790.81s -> 3800.42s]  push doesn't work on people. It's not strong enough. All right. I'm going to fight you guys on my terms.
[3800.42s -> 3822.90s]  Let's go. Yes, it does. Watch. Ready? Force push. Wow. That was very useful. That's not even a cool
[3822.90s -> 3836.10s]  power. That's not lightning. That's not choke. That's not resurrect the dead. Oh, no. You can't
[3836.10s -> 3874.76s]  speak of that power, Jeremy. All right. I'm going to do rage. They can't kill me. All right. I'm
[3874.76s -> 3894.90s]  done with these three. I'm done with these guys. I really am. Fucking kill them. All right. I can't
[3894.90s -> 3910.81s]  fight three. Watch out. Watch out. Watch. Block, block, block. Okay. Got one. Back it up. Back
[3910.81s -> 3919.43s]  it up. Back it up. Heal. Does that guy have no head? Okay. Hold on. Got it. That was a nice
[3919.43s -> 3924.63s]  little maneuver. Side stepped him. Just one more. One more. Now, he's going to get aggressive. Good.
[3924.63s -> 3953.18s]  I can do that too. Let's go, motherfucker. Let's do it. I love that Darth Maul move. Okay, I did it.
[3953.18s -> 3962.26s]  Defeat the Jedi and find a way to protect the Jedi. What? Defeat the Jedi and find a way to
[3962.26s -> 3987.45s]  protect the jedi's coffin what do you mean jedi he's a jedi who i see force pull what is this big
[3987.45s -> 4023.77s]  button for okay so pull it the big button push the button i can't push it do you pull buttons
[4023.77s -> 4032.25s]  no but apparently you can't push buttons either in this universe push i already did what am i
[4032.25s -> 4044.71s]  supposed to go in the car get open what am i supposed to do push the other button i thought
[4044.71s -> 4064.55s]  i did that already i tried to press i did force push this whole building is collapsing all right
[4064.55s -> 4077.21s]  it's just it's just a show it doesn't actually do anything it's gonna blow it's gonna blow

[4146.74s -> 4153.18s]  the sound the water makes when you move around if you take your hand and go into the water do
[4153.18s -> 4164.50s]  you go oh oh oh my god what this is liquid now we're going to dismantle device a resident jedi
[4164.50s -> 4173.58s]  scholar kyon recently learned of the planet yelara from our jedi holocron the planet was once home
[4173.58s -> 4178.54s]  to a peaceful yet primitive species that was not ready to be integrated into galactic society
[4178.54s -> 4184.30s]  for this reason the jedi master broden kelverdox harnessed the power of the planet to create a
[4184.30s -> 4191.42s]  cloaking device hiding the entire planet from discovery but to the disarray of the entire planet
[4191.42s -> 4199.82s]  because everything disappeared buildings roads ground people created a major major problem running
[4199.82s -> 4211.05s]  into people on the sidewalk accidentally but now someone else has discovered yelora go to yelora
[4211.05s -> 4214.41s]  and find out if anyone has been there if the cloaking device is in danger of being stolen
[4215.05s -> 4223.54s]  it'd be better to destroy it rather than have it fall into the wrong hands sidewalk is still there
[4224.70s -> 4236.81s]  whatever device is too powerful all right destroy the planet you got it i got you luke all right
[4236.81s -> 4258.09s]  force rage uh is 75 percent force drain is no let's do this um i like this one who's a sniper

[12970.82s -> 12980.28s]  damage that makes sense doesn't it no it doesn't turn the fucking lightsaber on why'd you turn it
[12980.28s -> 13008.31s]  off why do i keep turning the blade off it's saving power no it's just it's it's not smart
[13009.11s -> 13028.06s]  it's very stupid you still have melee the lightsaber would boil the water i don't know
[13028.06s -> 13034.76s]  how lightsaber is supposed to work it's just heat right it's so hot that it burns through flesh and
[13034.76s -> 13048.30s]  bone instantly that's kind of how it works right they don't it's a saber of light yeah that'd be
[13048.30s -> 13081.94s]  hot who's that both dead yes they are save it time for the final confrontation between who tavian
[13081.94s -> 13090.76s]  was rosh the entire time no i mean tavian rosh was tavian the entire time wait that's the same
[13090.76s -> 13099.90s]  thing i just said it again different way tavian is it there's a big big bad right that they're
[13099.90s -> 13121.94s]  working for rosh is the big bad nice no i'm not a jedi look at my saber we both have the same one
[13122.66s -> 13131.51s]  and by the way those who don't know to get a red lightsaber it's all it's about punishing and making
[13131.51s -> 13154.28s]  the crystals submit to you right remember that i'm reading the lore somewhere he was lying he knew

[13431.51s -> 13459.78s]  happened what's going on yeah you have to mine the crystal yourself i think all right it's the
[13459.78s -> 13466.70s]  whatever crystal calls to you or something i know i know what i know how the thing works
[13467.58s -> 13483.08s]  it's electrified i feel like i'm dying in this game more than i'm dying in dark souls i didn't
[13483.08s -> 13505.67s]  touch anything it's fucking electrocuting me what the fuck when do i get to go so there's
[13505.75s -> 13548.04s]  electricity there it smashes and then you can go in smash all right i fucking did it now what

[13628.74s -> 13634.97s]  attention at all when does this game take place you're in between what saga luke looks pretty
[13634.97s -> 13644.49s]  young so i'm gonna assume i mean luke doesn't look old or anything after episode six ten years
[13644.49s -> 13649.99s]  after return to the jedi okay yeah because he doesn't look old or anything so this is between
[13649.99s -> 13684.33s]  the sequel series cool all right okay i get it none of this is canon anymore it's not none of it
[13690.46s -> 13694.62s]  jayden oh i found you look like much of a captive rosh did you dream this up
[13694.62s -> 13701.82s]  or was it tavian's idea no jaden wait i was wrong please take me back to the academy
[13701.82s -> 13710.84s]  i need help okay jayden stay back please don't hurt me you tried to kill me and now you've lured me

[13736.41s -> 13750.76s]  know this isn't just another trick jay don't do it what finish him jedi wait listen to what you're
[13750.76s -> 13758.34s]  saying you're angry don't give into it leads to the dark side right you see the saber i'm holding
[13758.34s -> 13773.03s]  dude afraid of dying saber strike him down give into your anger i need a new apprentice
[13776.79s -> 13782.25s]  angel and demon on the shoulders who do i listen to deactivate your lightsaber
[13782.81s -> 13796.60s]  remain on the path i don't even know what it said why should i yourself said how powerful the dark
[13796.60s -> 13803.80s]  side was i was wrong no you were weak don't do it oh my god he's gonna do it

[13819.16s -> 13824.68s]  and rule the galaxy no you get down you're next why should i trade one master for another
[13824.68s -> 13830.49s]  the scepter of ragnos is too powerful to be left in the hands of someone as weak as tavian
[13831.05s -> 13838.22s]  if anything it should belong to me of course it should i think so you on the other hand are
[13838.22s -> 13845.30s]  useless i should have killed you on hoth you won't get a second chance tavian has taught me

[14039.64s -> 14042.84s]  right like can we have another reason why a villain would become a villain
[14043.48s -> 14050.47s]  it's like a big greedy artifact item the only thing that we can do to make people like evil
[14056.44s -> 14062.89s]  oh that powerful art of these different these people wait what i sense the dark side in you
[14062.89s -> 14068.49s]  jayden i can't let you pass i will pass is a different person want me to or not
[14069.45s -> 14085.72s]  it's a different npc don't just instantly kill me he killed her no that artifact is gonna be mine
[14086.52s -> 14102.20s]  i will kill anybody that's in my way to get that artifact no it's my artifact oh wait somebody
