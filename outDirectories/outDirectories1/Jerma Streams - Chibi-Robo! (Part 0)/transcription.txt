[1.78s -> 10.74s]  Viewers dropping. Is that someone who just wrote it in all capitals?
[10.74s -> 22.04s]  No, I think they're only going up from here. Oh shit, man. Viewers dropping.
[22.04s -> 35.59s]  That's so funny. Hey, how you doing, guys? I'm doing pretty good. I'm just hanging out with my...
[35.59s -> 41.59s]  a little bit of a messed up throat, but who cares? We got Chibi-Robo to play.
[41.59s -> 49.24s]  It's hard to say this. Chibi-Robo. I'm going to be playing this fun game called Chibi-Robo.
[49.24s -> 58.98s]  This was an expensive game. Looks pretty cool. The GameCube discs. I remember them.
[58.98s -> 66.87s]  They're very, very cool. These are a collector's item at this point. It's not in the...
[66.87s -> 75.37s]  Yeah, I'm playing it on a Wii. I know. Get over it. Not the original GameCube. That's fine.
[75.37s -> 85.56s]  But yeah, I've heard a lot of good things. I want to play Chibi-Robo. I'm into it.
[85.56s -> 91.56s]  I heard it's a game where you clean, you prepare food, and you use a dustpan and stuff.
[91.56s -> 95.80s]  I'm going to love this game. How am I not going to like this?
[95.80s -> 157.00s]  But let me tweet this out, and we'll start in about two minutes.
[157.00s -> 165.85s]  Alright, are you guys ready? I haven't done it yet. I'm not going to until we're ready.
[165.85s -> 172.28s]  The best part of the Wii is the fact that you can insert a GameCube disc at the top of the tray
[172.28s -> 176.28s]  or at the bottom of the tray, and it still figures out where it is.
[176.28s -> 181.86s]  Now that's some real technology. Alright, let's go.
[181.86s -> 194.24s]  Are you ready? It's going in. Should I show the disc first? Yeah, this is a big moment for us.
[194.24s -> 201.46s]  We're not getting married. But still, this is a big moment. First GameCube game.
[201.46s -> 215.90s]  Why should it not work? Ready? Look at this. Chibi-Robo.
[215.90s -> 225.79s]  Going in. No brace? No, not today. I'm trying to... I've got to relax it a little bit.
[225.79s -> 234.19s]  I've been wearing it too much. Here it goes. Another reason why I wanted to wait,
[234.19s -> 241.13s]  because it's going to do the sound, right? Here it comes. Here it comes.
[246.78s -> 256.52s]  Okay, hold on. We've got to test something real quick.
[256.52s -> 259.52s]  Because this is a GameCube, so who knows if it's even going to work.
[259.52s -> 266.30s]  Are you going to tell me? Am I synced up? Is the sound synced up?
[266.30s -> 275.05s]  Start. We. Start. We. Start. We. Start. Get. Get. Get. Are we good?
[275.05s -> 292.89s]  Just got to make sure. No. The voice is hard to tell. Alright, are you ready?
[292.89s -> 308.46s]  I'm going to do a circle. Circle. One, two, beep. It's good. No? It's fine.
[308.46s -> 313.76s]  He's completely naked. Alright, let's go. Chibi-Robo time. I'm ready.
[313.76s -> 318.60s]  I'm ready. I've been looking forward to this for like a year at least.
[318.60s -> 325.70s]  What's going on? Oh, do you want to display the game in progressive scan mode?
[325.70s -> 331.89s]  Oh, fuck yeah. Are you serious? That's HD of 2004.
[331.89s -> 342.62s]  Warning. Important health. Before playing, read the health and safety book.
[342.62s -> 351.96s]  They did this for Chibi-Robo for the GameCube? Why? Do you have to move around?
[356.27s -> 368.35s]  I already got cartoon clown sounds. Chibi-Robo. Oh, wow.
[368.35s -> 377.50s]  Alright, the screen might be a little... I might fix it a little off.
[377.50s -> 392.08s]  Looks alright. Can we adjust it? Why do I know what you're talking about?
[392.08s -> 400.53s]  This is...
[403.53s -> 406.53s]  Why do I know... I only have one...
[406.53s -> 409.53s]  Hold on, it's a little loud for me.
[409.53s -> 414.53s]  Why... I only have like one... I only have one barometer for what penis music is.
[414.53s -> 418.53s]  There's that one song. So of course I'm going to think that's what this is.
[420.09s -> 422.58s]  There it is!
[422.58s -> 425.58s]  Okay, I gotta turn it down. It's really loud.
[425.58s -> 432.84s]  Okay, that's at a decent volume. Actual wink.
[432.84s -> 436.84s]  Good, get them out because they're going away forever in like three days.
[436.84s -> 447.26s]  Turn off.
[447.26s -> 450.01s]  Wait, you need a memory card for the Wii?
[450.01s -> 452.01s]  I'm just fucking kidding.
[452.01s -> 457.86s]  Oh, wait, what about slot B?
[457.86s -> 460.86s]  It's in slot B! Why does it have to be in slot A?
[460.86s -> 479.12s]  Corrupted. What? Let's go.
[479.12s -> 484.09s]  Format. What are you talking about?
[484.09s -> 489.99s]  What do you mean the memory card is corrupted? It's been formatted.
[489.99s -> 491.99s]  The memory card slot A is corrupted.
[491.99s -> 501.94s]  What do you mean it's corrupted? Is this alright?
[501.94s -> 511.15s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[511.15s -> 517.59s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[517.59s -> 529.54s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Just give me a second.
[529.54s -> 531.54s]  Why is the memory card corrupted?
[531.54s -> 546.68s]  Is this like fucking... is this lying to me?
[546.68s -> 556.33s]  Hold on. My Wii just went...
[556.33s -> 558.63s]  Ah! Ah!
[558.63s -> 568.70s]  What the fuck is... I swear to God, there's a ghost that haunts me.
[568.70s -> 570.94s]  There's no way. There's no way.
[570.94s -> 573.94s]  I get haunted by a fucking ghost when I turn my stream on.
[573.94s -> 575.94s]  You guys understand how stupid this is? How insane this is.
[575.94s -> 577.94s]  I tested this before the stream turned on.
[577.94s -> 583.20s]  I literally did this like 35 seconds before the stream started.
[583.20s -> 587.20s]  I'm haunted by a ghost. There's a ghost that's trying to kill me.
[587.20s -> 594.18s]  The memory card slot A must be formatted. Format it now.
[594.18s -> 598.25s]  Yes. If the memory card is formatted, all saved data will be erased.
[598.25s -> 600.49s]  Fucking do it!
[600.49s -> 606.67s]  Okay. Okay. Nintendo GameCube slots open.
[606.67s -> 608.67s]  20 out of 43.
[608.67s -> 612.13s]  From 2043.
[612.13s -> 614.13s]  Okay. Are we good? Is it okay?
[614.13s -> 616.13s]  Can I fucking play the game?
[616.13s -> 626.22s]  Okay. Let's go.
[626.22s -> 628.22s]  I have 2043 blocks of data.
[628.22s -> 636.86s]  Hey! Remember that sound?
[636.86s -> 650.99s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[650.99s -> 652.99s]  Apologize. Apologize. Apologize.
[652.99s -> 654.99s]  That sounded slightly like the thing that I don't like.
[654.99s -> 663.18s]  It is an animated character. I don't like them.
[663.18s -> 665.49s]  Okay. Can I... This is gonna be fine, right?
[665.49s -> 668.94s]  Put in health and safety instructions.
[668.94s -> 673.17s]  Licensed by Nintendo. Bandai.
[673.17s -> 675.17s]  This is before they became Bandai Namco.
[675.17s -> 678.30s]  Alright.
[678.30s -> 680.30s]  It's been formatted.
[680.30s -> 698.72s]  What do I do? What do I do?
[698.72s -> 702.24s]  Choose yes.
[707.22s -> 709.22s]  The memory card slot A has been formatted.
[709.22s -> 711.22s]  The memory card slot A is corrupted.
[711.22s -> 720.82s]  I just did that because I had to.
[720.82s -> 727.28s]  Say yes. Say yes.
[727.28s -> 729.28s]  Just keep saying yes over and over again.
[729.28s -> 740.67s]  Blow on the memory card!
[740.67s -> 742.67s]  Blow on the memory card?
[742.67s -> 744.67s]  What? This is so sad.
[744.67s -> 765.41s]  I just... Why is...
[765.41s -> 767.41s]  512? What's wrong with that?
[767.41s -> 774.18s]  Alright. I pushed it in there like fucking hard.
[780.18s -> 793.36s]  Am I in slot B?
[793.36s -> 795.36s]  I can't do slot B because slot B...
[795.36s -> 799.52s]  I'm...
[799.52s -> 801.52s]  I can't do slot B because it doesn't let me choose slot B.
[803.52s -> 805.52s]  My form has slot A?
[805.52s -> 811.22s]  Alright. What's it?
[811.22s -> 813.22s]  Alright. It's in slot B.
[813.22s -> 815.22s]  Don't continue. Option.
[815.22s -> 823.22s]  Scream into it.
[823.22s -> 825.58s]  Alright. Hold on.
[825.58s -> 827.82s]  So now...
[827.82s -> 829.82s]  Bro, run to the store and buy a new memory card.
[829.82s -> 833.54s]  But the GameCube!
[833.54s -> 835.54s]  You want me to run to the store and get a
[835.54s -> 837.54s]  memory card for a console
[837.54s -> 839.54s]  that has been out of circulation for like
[839.54s -> 841.54s]  17 years!
[841.54s -> 843.78s]  You want me to run to the
[843.78s -> 859.97s]  store!
[859.97s -> 863.04s]  I'm going to...
[863.04s -> 874.62s]  I just want to play a game!
[874.62s -> 876.62s]  Wait a minute. Just don't say...
[876.62s -> 878.62s]  No! That's horrible!
[878.62s -> 880.62s]  I'll get it. No, I'm emulated!
[880.62s -> 882.62s]  This game was like a hundred
[882.62s -> 884.62s]  fucking dollars on eBay!
[884.62s -> 886.93s]  No! No, we're not emulating!
[886.93s -> 888.93s]  I have it! What a fucking
[888.93s -> 890.93s]  introduction!
[890.93s -> 892.93s]  Look at this! Oh! I can't wait to...
[892.93s -> 894.93s]  What can I say? Look!
[894.93s -> 896.93s]  Oh yeah! The GameCube disc!
[896.93s -> 898.93s]  Oh, remember? Oh, shh! Quiet!
[898.93s -> 900.93s]  Fucking joke.
[900.93s -> 906.75s]  I should have just fucking emulated the goddamn thing.
[906.75s -> 908.93s]  I should have just emulated literally everything.
[908.93s -> 910.93s]  Companies wonder why the fuck people do this shit.
[910.93s -> 914.26s]  I wonder why consumers
[914.26s -> 916.26s]  are downloading fake GameCube
[916.26s -> 918.26s]  game cards and ISOs.
[918.26s -> 920.26s]  No! It can't be!
[920.26s -> 922.26s]  It can't be because the shit don't work
[922.26s -> 955.34s]  when you're trying to use it for real!
[955.34s -> 959.95s]  What?!
[959.95s -> 961.95s]  It's right here! GameCube
[961.95s -> 963.95s]  slot A, slot B, it's right
[963.95s -> 965.95s]  fucking here! This shit works!
[965.95s -> 967.95s]  What? Oh!
[967.95s -> 976.34s]  I can't put it in slot A. Maybe the slot A
[976.34s -> 980.62s]  is corrupted? I don't... I had it in
[980.62s -> 982.62s]  slot A, we got to see the same image
[982.62s -> 986.72s]  in slot A. I don't...
[986.72s -> 988.72s]  You know what? I'm not
[988.72s -> 990.72s]  gonna turn the fucking stream off until I'm done with the game.
[990.72s -> 992.72s]  Let's go. I'm not spending
[992.72s -> 994.72s]  15 straight minutes on this nonsense.
[994.72s -> 1002.59s]  I gotta remember to card in slot B.
[1002.59s -> 1004.59s]  I should be able to choose... God damn it.
[1004.59s -> 1007.41s]  Let's have a board meeting about what the
[1007.41s -> 1010.67s]  hell do people...
[1010.67s -> 1012.67s]  Correct me if I'm wrong, fellow
[1012.67s -> 1014.67s]  person...
[1014.67s -> 1016.67s]  People are downloading
[1016.67s -> 1018.67s]  the video games and they're playing them without our
[1018.67s -> 1020.67s]  permission. Is there a reason
[1020.67s -> 1022.67s]  why people are doing this without
[1022.67s -> 1024.67s]  my permission?
[1024.67s -> 1030.82s]  Just like, play this VOD
[1030.82s -> 1032.82s]  to that person.
[1032.82s -> 1034.82s]  I actually don't know anything. I just
[1034.82s -> 1036.82s]  watched. I don't know what that means either.
[1036.82s -> 1038.82s]  I've never played a video game, so
[1038.82s -> 1041.25s]  it's lost on me.
[1041.25s -> 1056.42s]  You just talked over the GameCube
[1056.42s -> 1058.42s]  setup. How to fix a corrupted GameCube
[1058.42s -> 1066.48s]  memory card. What?
[1066.48s -> 1068.48s]  Power off the console, remove the card,
[1068.48s -> 1070.48s]  replace it, see if the message comes back, save
[1070.48s -> 1072.48s]  any files that aren't corrupted.
[1072.48s -> 1074.48s]  Leave the card alone. Place the card
[1074.48s -> 1076.48s]  away from anything electronic
[1076.48s -> 1078.48s]  for a week.
[1078.48s -> 1080.48s]  Hold on.
[1080.48s -> 1082.48s]  Hold on. No.
[1082.48s -> 1084.48s]  Excuse me.
[1084.48s -> 1086.48s]  Look at this.
[1086.48s -> 1088.48s]  Are you trying to tell me that this
[1088.48s -> 1093.73s]  is a real website?
[1093.73s -> 1095.73s]  This is a copypasta of the streamer I
[1095.73s -> 1097.73s]  met the streamer at.
[1097.73s -> 1100.29s]  Fucking Walgreens.
[1100.29s -> 1102.29s]  Leave the card alone. Place the card away from
[1102.29s -> 1104.29s]  anything electronic for about a week.
[1104.29s -> 1106.29s]  The lack of electromagnetic interference could help
[1106.29s -> 1121.90s]  fix the card. Huh?
[1121.90s -> 1123.90s]  This can only be done on a GameCube
[1123.90s -> 1125.90s]  console. If these steps
[1125.90s -> 1127.90s]  don't work, it must be reformatted. It can only be done on
[1127.90s -> 1130.34s]  a GameCube console.
[1134.34s -> 1136.34s]  Let's go. Fucking TV
[1136.34s -> 1138.34s]  robot. I'm ready. There's no card in slot A.
[1138.34s -> 1140.34s]  Who cares?
[1140.34s -> 1142.34s]  Continue without saving. I'll
[1142.34s -> 1145.22s]  find a way. Hey,
[1145.22s -> 1147.78s]  chibi-robo. I can pick slot B
[1147.78s -> 1161.34s]  when I save the game. I guarantee it.
[1165.50s -> 1168.13s]  Happy birthday, Jenny.
[1168.13s -> 1170.13s]  Here you go. I got you this hat as a special
[1170.13s -> 1175.18s]  present from me.
[1175.18s -> 1177.18s]  I see a coin. I see a coin. I see a coin.
[1177.18s -> 1185.38s]  That's all I care about.
[1185.38s -> 1191.52s]  Don't like it? What's wrong?
[1193.52s -> 1195.52s]  Jenny, you're eight now. You can't run
[1195.52s -> 1197.52s]  in a frog costume all day. You need a real
[1197.52s -> 1200.14s]  hat.
[1200.14s -> 1202.14s]  Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.
[1202.14s -> 1204.14s]  Oh, Jenny.
[1204.14s -> 1206.14s]  Woof, woof.
[1206.14s -> 1215.94s]  Ruff, ruff.
[1215.94s -> 1217.94s]  Oh, I got a present
[1217.94s -> 1219.94s]  for her too. Do you, Tau?
[1219.94s -> 1221.94s]  I got a present for her too.
[1221.94s -> 1225.46s]  Do you, Tau? Dog has a
[1225.46s -> 1227.46s]  present? It's a bow!
[1227.46s -> 1232.64s]  Woof.
[1232.64s -> 1234.64s]  Wow, good dog. How did you ruff it?
[1234.64s -> 1241.47s]  Ribbit, ribbit.
[1241.47s -> 1243.47s]  Another 3D movie maker family.
[1243.47s -> 1245.47s]  All right, now it's my turn.
[1245.47s -> 1248.16s]  You're just going to love
[1248.16s -> 1250.16s]  my gift, Jenny.
[1250.16s -> 1256.99s]  Yeah, right.
[1256.99s -> 1258.99s]  By the way, what an interesting
[1258.99s -> 1260.99s]  t-shirt. It just says the three on it.
[1260.99s -> 1264.13s]  Don't you want that shirt?
[1264.13s -> 1267.90s]  What is that? You know we can't afford
[1267.90s -> 1269.90s]  it. Jenny
[1269.90s -> 1272.72s]  says she wanted one.
[1272.72s -> 1275.66s]  Ribbit. Oh, honey, you're not
[1275.66s -> 1277.66s]  fooling anyone. You only wanted one for yourself.
[1277.66s -> 1279.66s]  Is this a chibi robo?
[1279.66s -> 1281.66s]  The latest and greatest in household
[1281.66s -> 1283.66s]  robots?
[1283.66s -> 1286.22s]  We'll talk about this later.
[1286.22s -> 1288.78s]  What do you think, Jenny?
[1288.78s -> 1290.78s]  Do you love it? You love it, right?
[1290.78s -> 1294.50s]  Uh, Jenny's not
[1294.50s -> 1297.70s]  communicating.
[1297.70s -> 1306.06s]  My eyes?
[1306.06s -> 1308.06s]  Damn.
[1308.06s -> 1310.06s]  Get ready, chibi robo. It's almost
[1310.06s -> 1313.84s]  showtime. This is when I get out
[1313.84s -> 1316.66s]  and I'm going to be like, look at me!
[1316.66s -> 1318.66s]  I'm going to be like, look at me!
[1322.62s -> 1324.62s]  They're talking like sims,
[1324.62s -> 1327.18s]  but scary.
[1327.18s -> 1329.18s]  What do you think? Should I flip the switch?
[1329.18s -> 1333.84s]  Let's do it.
[1333.84s -> 1335.84s]  The movie's with Azadjara Taylor.
[1335.84s -> 1338.91s]  All right, get ready to
[1338.91s -> 1340.91s]  Azadjara robo.
[1346.11s -> 1348.11s]  Ratchet, ratchet. We got it.
[1348.11s -> 1357.90s]  Holy shit, it really is going on.
[1357.90s -> 1374.08s]  This is quite an introduction.
[1374.08s -> 1376.08s]  I can't wait to get the coin on the counter.
[1376.08s -> 1380.75s]  Yay, chibi robo.
[1380.75s -> 1386.26s]  Hello, hello.
[1386.26s -> 1388.69s]  Hello there.
[1388.69s -> 1391.57s]  Ribbit.
[1391.57s -> 1394.00s]  Arf.
[1394.00s -> 1396.30s]  We're here to make you happy.
[1396.30s -> 1398.30s]  I'm Telly and this is chibi robo.
[1398.30s -> 1400.30s]  Amazing!
[1400.30s -> 1402.30s]  Ribbit.
[1402.30s -> 1405.30s]  Woof.
[1405.30s -> 1407.30s]  Oh!
[1407.30s -> 1409.30s]  Hey, is this a birthday party?
[1409.30s -> 1411.30s]  You got that right.
[1411.30s -> 1413.98s]  Uh-oh, chibi robo.
[1413.98s -> 1415.98s]  It looks like we've come to the party empty-handed.
[1415.98s -> 1418.42s]  We need to find a present
[1418.42s -> 1420.42s]  for Jenny and fast.
[1420.42s -> 1424.30s]  Is this a children's game?
[1424.30s -> 1428.72s]  Oh. How about that flower,
[1428.72s -> 1432.37s]  chibi robo?
[1432.37s -> 1435.70s]  No. No.
[1435.70s -> 1437.94s]  Really? Are you sure?
[1437.94s -> 1439.94s]  I think it's perfect for Jenny.
[1439.94s -> 1443.26s]  No. I don't like,
[1443.26s -> 1448.26s]  I don't want to give that present.
[1448.26s -> 1450.26s]  Really? Are you sure? I think it's perfect
[1450.26s -> 1452.26s]  for Jenny. Oh, we're getting forced
[1452.26s -> 1454.26s]  into saying yes. Okay.
[1454.26s -> 1456.26s]  Yes, I do agree with you.
[1456.26s -> 1459.14s]  I'll leave the rest to you, chibi robo.
[1459.14s -> 1461.14s]  Whoa, the game just got way louder.
[1461.14s -> 1464.34s]  I have a big plug on my
[1464.34s -> 1467.41s]  back? Uh, chibi robo,
[1467.41s -> 1469.41s]  don't get that plug in any
[1469.41s -> 1471.41s]  water or any food.
[1471.41s -> 1473.41s]  Chibi, don't dunk the end
[1473.41s -> 1475.41s]  of the plug into the orange juice.
[1475.41s -> 1479.76s]  Alright, let's get it. How do I jump?
[1479.76s -> 1488.78s]  What?
[1488.78s -> 1490.78s]  They didn't tell me how to move.
[1490.78s -> 1493.73s]  So loud.
[1493.73s -> 1497.76s]  Jenny!
[1497.76s -> 1504.91s]  Alright, let's get it. I got it.
[1504.91s -> 1508.05s]  Okay, rose.
[1508.05s -> 1510.29s]  That fits in there?
[1510.29s -> 1513.10s]  Hot.
[1513.10s -> 1517.07s]  That's awesome.
[1525.76s -> 1528.19s]  Excellent. Chibi robo,
[1528.19s -> 1530.19s]  chibi robo. You should try using
[1530.19s -> 1532.43s]  your chibi copter.
[1532.43s -> 1534.43s]  It comes standard in all chibi robo models.
[1534.43s -> 1536.43s]  All you have to do is equip it.
[1536.43s -> 1538.43s]  You can't fly upwards with it, but
[1538.43s -> 1540.61s]  listen to this.
[1540.61s -> 1542.61s]  You can use it to slowly fall from high
[1542.61s -> 1544.61s]  places. That way you won't hurt this fall
[1544.61s -> 1547.10s]  damage. Press X to open the
[1547.10s -> 1550.37s]  equip screen.
[1550.37s -> 1552.37s]  Tilt left or right to select the chibi copter
[1552.37s -> 1554.37s]  and then press A to equip it.
[1554.37s -> 1557.63s]  It's on my go-go gadget.
[1557.63s -> 1560.83s]  Oh, and if you hold down A, you'll hover
[1560.83s -> 1562.83s]  horizontally for a short time.
[1562.83s -> 1564.83s]  It's handy when you want to fly over small gaps
[1564.83s -> 1567.07s]  or drop from high places. Hey,
[1567.07s -> 1569.07s]  listen up, chibi robo.
[1569.07s -> 1571.07s]  Use the chibi copter, okay?
[1571.07s -> 1574.14s]  I don't want you to take a nasty fall.
[1574.14s -> 1576.14s]  Alright, you've made it very clear.
[1576.14s -> 1578.83s]  Press B to put the copter away.
[1578.83s -> 1593.17s]  Okay, so that's it.
[1593.17s -> 1595.17s]  This toy sucks.
[1595.17s -> 1597.17s]  Imagine getting this on Christmas.
[1597.17s -> 1599.17s]  Oh, wow.
[1599.17s -> 1601.17s]  That's really cool.
[1601.17s -> 1610.77s]  Yes, I was trying to dunk the thing
[1610.77s -> 1612.77s]  in the orange juice. Alright, good.
[1612.77s -> 1617.74s]  Now what? Hurry up and give that
[1617.74s -> 1622.10s]  flower to- oh. Come here.
[1622.10s -> 1624.10s]  I got a flower for you.
[1624.10s -> 1630.88s]  I think Mrs. Sanderson made
[1630.88s -> 1632.88s]  this cake. You can't eat anything
[1632.88s -> 1634.88s]  anyway, chibi robo.
[1634.88s -> 1637.44s]  Oh. Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt
[1637.44s -> 1639.68s]  your feelings. Oh.
[1639.68s -> 1641.98s]  If you move next to an object and you see
[1641.98s -> 1643.98s]  the exclamation icon, press
[1643.98s -> 1648.02s]  A. I just did.
[1648.02s -> 1651.73s]  What feelings?
[1651.73s -> 1654.74s]  Oh, right. It's a robot.
[1654.74s -> 1667.86s]  Do I have to float over there?
[1667.86s -> 1670.74s]  Coin behind turkey? Oh, shit.
[1670.74s -> 1679.94s]  Got it.
[1679.94s -> 1681.94s]  What about the turkey? Looks like
[1681.94s -> 1683.94s]  chicken is on the menu tonight.
[1683.94s -> 1685.94s]  Chicken. That's a word that brings back some
[1685.94s -> 1687.94s]  really bad memories from me.
[1687.94s -> 1691.52s]  Oh, but maybe now isn't the time to talk about
[1691.52s -> 1695.68s]  that. What? Alright, we gotta float
[1695.68s -> 1700.42s]  over there. Take out the helicopter.
[1700.42s -> 1703.10s]  Let's go. Here we go. Float onto
[1703.10s -> 1705.92s]  the cake. On cake.
[1705.92s -> 1708.93s]  Here we go. Give rose.
[1708.93s -> 1712.82s]  I think Mrs.
[1712.82s -> 1714.82s]  can't eat anything anyway. How do I give the rose?
[1714.82s -> 1722.43s]  Do I have to equip it?
[1722.43s -> 1725.25s]  Wait. Frog ring?
[1725.25s -> 1732.42s]  I'm looking through my eyes.
[1732.42s -> 1735.74s]  Alright, how do I give you the-
[1735.74s -> 1737.74s]  I already did that.
[1737.74s -> 1743.50s]  Was I not close? Alright.
[1743.50s -> 1745.50s]  I tried to do that before. I guess I wasn't close enough.
[1745.50s -> 1751.46s]  Chibi Robo, give the rose to Jenny.
[1751.46s -> 1757.33s]  Yes.
[1757.33s -> 1762.75s]  Here you go.
[1762.75s -> 1764.75s]  This game is cute. It looks very cute.
[1764.75s -> 1768.34s]  You got 20 happy
[1768.34s -> 1771.02s]  points. Are they sad
[1771.02s -> 1773.02s]  points? And you got 120-
[1773.02s -> 1775.02s]  I don't know. What is that?
[1775.02s -> 1781.17s]  What kind of currency is that?
[1781.17s -> 1786.29s]  Spread the happiness.
[1786.29s -> 1788.29s]  Earn happy points in
[1788.29s -> 1790.29s]  Moolah by making people happy.
[1790.29s -> 1792.29s]  Of course, earning lots of happy points
[1792.29s -> 1794.29s]  will raise your Chibi Robo ranking.
[1794.29s -> 1796.29s]  Let's do our best to get you into
[1796.29s -> 1798.91s]  first place. Are there
[1798.91s -> 1800.91s]  items in the house?
[1800.91s -> 1804.88s]  Now for Jenny to blow out the candles. Do I have to compete
[1804.88s -> 1806.88s]  with the vacuum cleaner? And the
[1806.88s -> 1814.30s]  Lysol? Or what?
[1814.30s -> 1817.81s]  One. Two.
[1817.81s -> 1821.39s]  Yeah. Although I can't-
[1821.39s -> 1823.39s]  I really can't agree with their use of
[1823.39s -> 1825.39s]  candles on the cake. Blow it out on the cake.
[1825.39s -> 1827.39s]  That's disgusting. Now nobody wants to eat the cake because
[1827.39s -> 1829.39s]  the little kids spit all over the cake.
[1829.39s -> 1831.39s]  And what I'd like
[1831.39s -> 1833.39s]  to see is
[1833.39s -> 1835.63s]  a separate cupcake that has
[1835.63s -> 1837.63s]  a candle on it. You blow
[1837.63s -> 1839.63s]  the two or three candles on one little cupcake.
[1839.63s -> 1841.63s]  They blow them all over
[1841.63s -> 1843.63s]  the cupcake. Okay, cool. Now the cake is fine. Everyone can
[1843.63s -> 1849.90s]  eat it. Go to work, Chibi Robo.
[1849.90s -> 1855.66s]  You looked a bit
[1855.66s -> 1857.66s]  nervous at first, but you came through like a pro.
[1857.66s -> 1860.61s]  Put plastic over the cake?
[1860.61s -> 1862.61s]  Why would you-
[1862.61s -> 1865.87s]  Now listen, we need to make ourselves useful
[1865.87s -> 1867.87s]  to the Sandersons, right?
[1867.87s -> 1869.87s]  Okay.
[1869.87s -> 1871.87s]  Let's adjust your happy point total.
[1871.87s -> 1873.87s]  But it gets adjusted?
[1873.87s -> 1877.01s]  Your Chibi
[1877.01s -> 1879.01s]  ranking has gone from
[1879.01s -> 1881.38s]  1 million to
[1881.38s -> 1883.38s]  782 thousand. Why did I lose
[1883.38s -> 1885.38s]  happy points?
[1885.38s -> 1887.38s]  Oh, I'm gaining, right.
[1887.38s -> 1891.73s]  I'm gaining rank.
[1891.73s -> 1893.73s]  Get out there and earn a ton of happy points and
[1893.73s -> 1895.73s]  grab yourself the top Chibi ranking.
[1895.73s -> 1897.73s]  When you reach top
[1897.73s -> 1899.90s]  Chibi ranking, why
[1899.90s -> 1901.90s]  you'll be upgraded
[1901.90s -> 1903.90s]  to Super Chibi Robo.
[1908.98s -> 1911.98s]  Take it from me, TeleVision.
[1911.98s -> 1915.12s]  Ah, that's a good name. I'll do what I can
[1915.12s -> 1919.60s]  to lend you a hand. You can count on me.
[1919.60s -> 1923.25s]  TeleVision.
[1923.25s -> 1926.51s]  Professor E. Gadd.
[1926.51s -> 1928.51s]  Yes, I would love to save the game.
[1928.51s -> 1930.51s]  I would love to. And I'd like to do it in slot
[1930.51s -> 1955.54s]  B. Fuck.
[1955.54s -> 1959.74s]  Let's go.
[1959.74s -> 1961.74s]  I can't pick the slot.
[1961.74s -> 1964.82s]  Really, I can't.
[1964.82s -> 1966.82s]  Oh, this is so cool and cute.
[1966.82s -> 1972.51s]  Hold on. Can I not?
[1972.51s -> 1974.51s]  Yes, I want to save.
[1974.51s -> 1976.51s]  God damn it.
[1978.69s -> 1980.69s]  This is an ungrounded outlet.
[1986.00s -> 1988.00s]  I would like to save.
[1988.00s -> 1990.62s]  God damn it.
[1993.44s -> 2007.06s]  Okay.
[2007.06s -> 2019.26s]  I don't know what to do.
[2019.26s -> 2021.26s]  I don't know what to do.
[2021.26s -> 2023.26s]  I know what I have to do,
[2023.26s -> 2025.26s]  which is unfortunate. I have to either beat the whole game in one
[2025.26s -> 2027.26s]  stream,
[2027.26s -> 2029.26s]  or I have to leave the fucking
[2029.26s -> 2031.26s]  Wii turned on and on overnight.
[2031.26s -> 2036.58s]  This is literally a two stream game.
[2036.58s -> 2039.33s]  God damn it.
[2044.26s -> 2046.26s]  Amazon one day
[2046.26s -> 2048.26s]  shipping.
[2048.26s -> 2050.26s]  Can I do Amazon same day?
[2050.26s -> 2052.88s]  Oh.
[2052.88s -> 2056.98s]  Please. Please.
[2056.98s -> 2064.40s]  No.
[2064.40s -> 2071.82s]  God damn it.
[2071.82s -> 2081.15s]  This is bad.
[2081.15s -> 2083.15s]  The game is upwards of like 14 hours.
[2083.15s -> 2086.42s]  How long is the game?
[2086.42s -> 2090.06s]  How long is the game?
[2090.06s -> 2094.86s]  Blow into the port. 12 to 15 hours?
[2094.86s -> 2098.45s]  About 12 hours?
[2098.45s -> 2101.01s]  12 to 20 hours?
[2101.01s -> 2105.55s]  Okay.
[2105.55s -> 2107.55s]  It takes 15 hours to beat this game on a speedrun.
[2107.55s -> 2109.55s]  I don't believe that. I'm going to blow in the port.
[2109.55s -> 2125.94s]  We're going to try everything.
[2125.94s -> 2127.94s]  Make sure it's got good contact with the receptacles.
[2127.94s -> 2130.30s]  Good contact.
[2130.30s -> 2135.55s]  Good. I just like got it in there.
[2135.55s -> 2139.14s]  Good contact.
[2139.14s -> 2142.53s]  Let's try it again.
[2142.53s -> 2147.07s]  Just pretend you're not streaming
[2147.07s -> 2149.95s]  to the ghost leaves.
[2149.95s -> 2151.95s]  You just spit all over the cake. It's going to be alright.
[2151.95s -> 2153.95s]  I know. I know.
[2153.95s -> 2155.95s]  But happy points. Fuck.
[2155.95s -> 2158.19s]  Save the game. Come on. Right here.
[2158.19s -> 2172.53s]  Let's go. I just got good contact.
[2172.53s -> 2178.03s]  I had this problem before.
[2178.03s -> 2180.03s]  You literally have to smack it against something hard.
[2180.03s -> 2182.03s]  Like with a fucking hammer?
[2182.03s -> 2184.34s]  I need to hit my
[2184.34s -> 2186.34s]  GameCube memory card
[2186.34s -> 2188.34s]  with a hammer. Is that what you're telling me to do?
[2188.34s -> 2190.34s]  Hit it with a fucking hammer.
[2190.34s -> 2192.34s]  Are you serious? No.
[2192.34s -> 2198.35s]  That's not. It's true.
[2198.35s -> 2213.44s]  Shake it?
[2213.44s -> 2222.85s]  This is not doing anything.
[2222.85s -> 2225.47s]  Like go shake it.
[2225.47s -> 2261.12s]  Smack it around.
[2261.12s -> 2263.12s]  Save the game.
[2263.12s -> 2284.24s]  Yes, I would. Yes.
[2284.24s -> 2286.24s]  Leave the free turned on. That's so bad.
[2286.24s -> 2288.24s]  It looks good. Oh, I'm so fucking sad.
[2288.24s -> 2294.83s]  Leave the free turned on.
[2294.83s -> 2303.92s]  One last thing.
[2303.92s -> 2306.46s]  One last thing.
[2306.46s -> 2320.42s]  I'm going to try one last fucking thing.
[2320.42s -> 2323.62s]  I'm going to close it into the door.
[2323.62s -> 2325.62s]  He's going to get a hammer. MonkaS.
[2325.62s -> 2327.62s]  No, I'm not going to get a fucking hammer. I'm not stupid.
[2327.62s -> 2332.22s]  I'm not going to go get a fucking hammer.
[2332.22s -> 2334.22s]  What I'm going to do is I'm just going to close it into the closet.
[2334.22s -> 2338.11s]  Look.
[2338.11s -> 2340.93s]  I'm not naked. Don't worry.
[2340.93s -> 2342.93s]  I do have my nails already long so I can relax.
[2342.93s -> 2344.93s]  I don't want you to see the secret stash of GameCube games though.
[2344.93s -> 2346.93s]  Whatever.
[2346.93s -> 2354.21s]  Stay right there.
[2354.21s -> 2374.74s]  See in here?
[2374.74s -> 2376.98s]  See that?
[2376.98s -> 2378.98s]  It's in there right now. It's literally inside of here.
[2378.98s -> 2380.98s]  It's right there.
[2380.98s -> 2382.98s]  Can you see the GameCube?
[2382.98s -> 2413.18s]  Memory card?
[2413.18s -> 2418.94s]  Not harder. That's a bad idea.
[2418.94s -> 2437.36s]  Here we go. It's in.
[2437.36s -> 2439.36s]  It's not going to fucking do anything.
[2439.36s -> 2441.36s]  It's not going to work.
[2441.36s -> 2443.36s]  It's not going to happen.
[2443.36s -> 2445.36s]  This thing is fucked up.
[2445.36s -> 2447.36s]  I'm going to Amazon same day a fucking memory card.
[2447.36s -> 2451.78s]  What time is it?
[2451.78s -> 2453.78s]  Just turn off the Wii completely and unplug it.
[2453.78s -> 2455.78s]  What?
[2455.78s -> 2457.78s]  I already did that. I can't.
[2457.78s -> 2464.05s]  Turn the Wii off.
[2464.05s -> 2466.05s]  No. I guess we didn't do that much.
[2466.05s -> 2469.44s]  Should I try turning the Wii off?
[2469.44s -> 2471.44s]  Alright. You ready? Okay. Here we go.
[2471.44s -> 2474.83s]  Turn the Wii off?
[2474.83s -> 2476.83s]  No. Yes. No. Just neutralize.
[2476.83s -> 2478.83s]  What? Turn it upside down.
[2478.83s -> 2480.83s]  No. Yes. Make him go to GameStop.
[2480.83s -> 2482.83s]  No. You can't buy these anywhere.
[2482.83s -> 2488.27s]  It's alright.
[2488.27s -> 2490.27s]  I'm going to do one more fucking thing.
[2490.27s -> 2492.27s]  If this doesn't work, then fuck it.
[2492.27s -> 2494.27s]  I'm going to have to just play.
[2494.27s -> 2499.65s]  You have to restart the game.
[2499.65s -> 2502.59s]  You have to turn it off.
[2502.59s -> 2505.41s]  Hold on.
[2505.41s -> 2510.66s]  It was just a dumb tutorial.
[2510.66s -> 2513.15s]  We can wait. Buy a new one.
[2513.15s -> 2515.15s]  It's right here. Hold on.
[2515.15s -> 2517.15s]  I'm going to format the card in the Wii menu.
[2517.15s -> 2519.15s]  Turn the console off. Turn it back on.
[2519.15s -> 2524.72s]  Alright. That's the plan.
[2524.72s -> 2528.18s]  Right? Is that the way that I need to try?
[2528.18s -> 2531.82s]  It's not going to work?
[2531.82s -> 2533.82s]  No. Reset your Wi-Fi.
[2533.82s -> 2535.82s]  Reformat the card.
[2535.82s -> 2539.09s]  Hold on. Stop talking.
[2539.09s -> 2541.52s]  Nobody talk.
[2541.52s -> 2547.73s]  Stop talking.
[2547.73s -> 2549.73s]  Restart the console and a little warning should come up at the start.
[2549.73s -> 2551.73s]  The last thing the card needs to be formatted.
[2551.73s -> 2554.10s]  Reformat the card.
[2554.10s -> 2556.10s]  The card must be reformatted. This can only be done in a GameCube console.
[2556.10s -> 2558.10s]  All the data in the card must be deleted.
[2558.10s -> 2560.10s]  Restart the console and a little warning should come up.
[2560.10s -> 2562.34s]  This is the Wii.
[2562.34s -> 2566.56s]  Yes.
[2566.56s -> 2568.56s]  This reformatted card will work again
[2568.56s -> 2572.66s]  with both the GameCube and the Wii.
[2572.66s -> 2576.37s]  I need a GameCube to do this.
[2576.37s -> 2590.82s]  I already did this.
[2590.82s -> 2596.45s]  I'm just going to leave the fucking Wii on.
[2596.45s -> 2598.45s]  Guys, there's definitely no such thing as an Amazon
[2598.45s -> 2600.45s]  same day delivery for a GameCube
[2600.45s -> 2611.78s]  memory card.
[2611.78s -> 2617.79s]  I'm going to leave the fucking Wii turned on?
[2617.79s -> 2624.38s]  Same hour delivery.
[2624.38s -> 2626.38s]  What happens if I lose without a save file?
[2626.38s -> 2629.46s]  Leave the stream on too.
[2629.46s -> 2631.46s]  Alright. Well, I don't think so.
[2631.46s -> 2633.46s]  This is not a game where you like lose and die
[2633.46s -> 2635.46s]  and go to game over. I don't think so.
[2644.10s -> 2646.10s]  Call GameStop?
[2646.10s -> 2648.10s]  Guys, they're closing GameStops everywhere.
[2648.10s -> 2656.48s]  No one's going in them.
[2656.48s -> 2658.48s]  It just needs to be an SD card. How's that going to fit
[2658.48s -> 2666.93s]  in the top slot?
[2666.93s -> 2668.93s]  Oh, Mr. Sanderson. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
[2668.93s -> 2670.93s]  He had a little too much fun at the party.
[2670.93s -> 2672.93s]  I think he passed out from excitement.
[2672.93s -> 2676.83s]  It goes in the front slot. Yeah, for the Wii
[2676.83s -> 2678.83s]  you need a GameCube memory card to be able to save
[2678.83s -> 2680.83s]  GameCube games. The Wii is just
[2680.83s -> 2683.52s]  a GameCube. It's like the same hardware.
[2683.52s -> 2685.52s]  They just made it a little faster. Look, I've done
[2685.52s -> 2692.30s]  my research. Don't worry. It is. No, it isn't.
[2692.30s -> 2694.30s]  It is. And people that don't know that, the Wii
[2694.30s -> 2696.30s]  is just a GameCube with a new shell
[2696.30s -> 2698.30s]  that they made a little bit faster.
[2698.30s -> 2700.30s]  That's the truth. Go look it up right now. I want you to
[2700.30s -> 2702.30s]  look it up so you go, oh fuck, he was right. Holy shit.
[2702.30s -> 2706.72s]  SD cards work?
[2706.72s -> 2709.54s]  No, they don't. No, they don't because it's not going
[2709.54s -> 2711.54s]  to read that in slot A or B for
[2711.54s -> 2713.54s]  the GameCube. Trust me, I did my research.
[2713.54s -> 2720.96s]  Here's what's going to happen, okay?
[2720.96s -> 2722.96s]  I'm going to Amazon next
[2722.96s -> 2724.96s]  day for tomorrow, a new memory card.
[2724.96s -> 2727.50s]  The Wii is going to stay on.
[2727.50s -> 2729.50s]  Tomorrow morning when, you know,
[2729.50s -> 2731.50s]  here's the new memory card, I'm going
[2731.50s -> 2740.85s]  to put it in and save the game.
[2740.85s -> 2746.72s]  You'll see a sun symbol during the
[2746.72s -> 2748.72s]  day and the moon symbol at night.
[2748.72s -> 2750.72s]  The moon is out right now, so that means it's night
[2750.72s -> 2754.50s]  time. What if that card is corrupted,
[2754.50s -> 2756.50s]  dude? If that doesn't work
[2756.50s -> 2758.50s]  then I'm just going to play it.
[2758.50s -> 2763.94s]  It'll be on still.
[2763.94s -> 2765.94s]  And plus, I'm going to just fucking beat the game tonight.
[2765.94s -> 2772.59s]  Oh my god, I'm cleaning
[2772.59s -> 2775.47s]  up. Proper trash.
[2775.47s -> 2777.47s]  Always put refuse in a
[2777.47s -> 2781.38s]  proper receptacle.
[2781.38s -> 2786.11s]  Holy shit, I get to clean up?
[2786.11s -> 2791.94s]  Wow, unbelievable.
[2791.94s -> 2796.48s]  What's over here? This is trash.
[2796.48s -> 2798.48s]  Candy wrapper. Always put
[2798.48s -> 2800.48s]  refuse in a proper receptacle.
[2800.48s -> 2803.30s]  We get to pick up
[2803.30s -> 2805.30s]  trash. Oh, I love this game.
[2805.30s -> 2807.30s]  I'm so glad I can save it
[2807.30s -> 2809.30s]  with my fucking memory card that doesn't work.
[2809.30s -> 2818.70s]  Make sure to save your progress.
[2818.70s -> 2821.07s]  Yeah, it's called
[2821.07s -> 2823.07s]  leave the Wii turned on until I can
[2823.07s -> 2825.07s]  somehow get a memory card here
[2825.07s -> 2827.95s]  overnight. Coins?
[2827.95s -> 2841.20s]  When was the last time you saved?
[2841.20s -> 2847.86s]  Good question.
[2847.86s -> 2849.86s]  Well, that's why it doesn't make any sense because when I
[2849.86s -> 2851.86s]  reformatted on the Wii menu
[2851.86s -> 2854.35s]  it's like, oh, here you go.
[2854.35s -> 2856.35s]  2,043 blocks. And then I
[2856.35s -> 2858.35s]  turn this on and it's like, this thing's fucked up.
[2858.35s -> 2867.68s]  I can't use this.
[2867.68s -> 2872.35s]  I'm going to get whatever this is. Can I pull
[2872.35s -> 2881.50s]  this out? Oh, there we go.
[2881.50s -> 2884.13s]  Is it Amazon, I think?
[2884.13s -> 2887.01s]  Hold on, wait, wait.
[2887.01s -> 2889.01s]  Impatible for Wii GameCube.
[2889.01s -> 2891.01s]  I already, this is one of the, I bought one
[2891.01s -> 2893.70s]  of these. Free
[2893.70s -> 2896.06s]  one day
[2896.06s -> 2899.14s]  delivery. Alright, everyone, hold on.
[2899.14s -> 2901.38s]  Nobody move.
[2901.38s -> 2913.33s]  Free one day delivery.
[2913.33s -> 2915.33s]  He wants to put a two year protection
[2915.33s -> 2917.33s]  plan.
[2917.33s -> 2923.66s]  Sure.
[2923.66s -> 2925.66s]  I'll take a two year protection.
[2925.66s -> 2927.66s]  Should have bought the two year protection plan.
[2927.66s -> 2936.37s]  I'm losing power. Oh, shit, I am.
[2936.37s -> 2940.02s]  Hold on, pause again. Fuckin' joke.
[2940.02s -> 2944.69s]  Alright, let me, let me see.
[2944.69s -> 2950.45s]  Hold on, I'm buying something.
[2950.45s -> 2955.95s]  Hold on, I'm purchasing something. Give me
[2955.95s -> 2962.42s]  a sec. Tomorrow.
[2962.42s -> 2968.11s]  One day delivery.
[2968.11s -> 2970.11s]  Nah, this, yeah, I mean, but I, what
[2970.11s -> 2972.11s]  am I going to do? I have to get one for tomorrow.
[2972.11s -> 2979.34s]  Alright, fuck it.
[2979.34s -> 2986.51s]  Okay. Tomorrow night.
[2986.51s -> 2988.51s]  Beat it in one play through.
[2988.51s -> 2990.75s]  We have to, actually, we have to
[2990.75s -> 2996.38s]  test something. We have to test to see
[2996.38s -> 2998.38s]  if I like jump off a cliff and die.
[2998.38s -> 3003.57s]  Alright, what happens? I got a frog card.
[3003.57s -> 3009.46s]  We explodes.
[3009.46s -> 3011.46s]  It loads the last
[3011.46s -> 3013.46s]  save. We need to test it because
[3013.46s -> 3015.46s]  if that's the case, then I, I have to
[3015.46s -> 3017.46s]  like do something else today.
[3017.46s -> 3031.90s]  Does that hurt? You're playing hardcore
[3031.90s -> 3036.38s]  mode. You get sent back to
[3036.38s -> 3038.38s]  the chibi house. Don't worry. Okay. Alright.
[3038.38s -> 3045.23s]  Cookie crumbs.
[3045.23s -> 3051.63s]  So that actually is my power. So I have to plug
[3051.63s -> 3057.78s]  in. Why, why does every step have to
[3057.78s -> 3069.55s]  be another note? Get the
[3069.55s -> 3071.55s]  get the Jerma branded memory card.
[3071.55s -> 3073.55s]  Why the fuck is this? This is stupid.
[3073.55s -> 3076.11s]  You got two thousand forty
[3076.11s -> 3078.11s]  three blocks open. Okay, cool.
[3078.11s -> 3080.11s]  Just kidding. The whole thing is corrupted. You can't use it.
[3080.11s -> 3084.34s]  Goodbye.
[3084.34s -> 3088.82s]  It's a red bubble
[3088.82s -> 3093.55s]  memory card. Glad he had
[3093.55s -> 3095.55s]  a good time. Oh.
[3095.55s -> 3097.55s]  Walking around drains your battery.
[3097.55s -> 3099.55s]  Keep an eye on your energy.
[3099.55s -> 3101.55s]  If your battery starts to run out, plug into an outlet
[3101.55s -> 3106.61s]  and recharge. Oh, that's cool. What is
[3106.61s -> 3108.78s]  this thing? Is it combat?
[3108.78s -> 3112.05s]  Dear diary, tonight I'm in my usual
[3112.05s -> 3114.05s]  spot and the living room body
[3114.05s -> 3115.05s]  in the kitchen.
[3115.05s -> 3118.12s]  Pound neglected me again. Typical.
[3118.12s -> 3121.19s]  He usually drops me right over there.
[3121.19s -> 3125.03s]  But tonight he was lazy and now
[3125.03s -> 3127.03s]  I and now I can watch Drake
[3127.03s -> 3130.04s]  while he patrols. Oh, it's so
[3130.04s -> 3132.04s]  hard to watch him that knight in shiny armor.
[3132.04s -> 3136.58s]  Oh, Drake.
[3136.58s -> 3138.58s]  I'm sorry. I didn't see you. Perhaps you are
[3138.58s -> 3140.58s]  on love patrol.
[3140.58s -> 3143.21s]  Oh,
[3143.21s -> 3148.12s]  oh, those pupils.
[3148.12s -> 3150.36s]  Are you looking at my diary?
[3150.36s -> 3152.36s]  Stop it. Oh, what a cad.
[3152.36s -> 3154.73s]  Oh, who are you?
[3154.73s -> 3161.88s]  Hey, now what's all the racket?
[3161.88s -> 3163.88s]  Oh, what in the? That toy is talking.
[3163.88s -> 3167.66s]  That's just how things work in this house.
[3167.66s -> 3169.66s]  Isn't that how it works everywhere?
[3169.66s -> 3171.83s]  Really? Well, that's a bit of a shocker.
[3171.83s -> 3173.83s]  So I take it there are other toys.
[3173.83s -> 3176.78s]  How rude of me. My name is Television
[3176.78s -> 3178.78s]  and this is Chibi Robo.
[3178.78s -> 3184.01s]  My name is Sophie.
[3184.01s -> 3186.01s]  Well, we're pleased as punch to meet you.
[3186.01s -> 3189.78s]  I was just writing in my diary and I thought
[3189.78s -> 3191.78s]  you were trying to peek. You scared me.
[3191.78s -> 3194.60s]  No worries. Happens all the time. Chibi
[3194.60s -> 3196.60s]  Robo small, so it's easy for him to sneak up
[3196.60s -> 3199.03s]  on you. Please allow me to apologize
[3199.03s -> 3201.03s]  on his behalf. We're both sorry we startled
[3201.03s -> 3203.46s]  you. Well, as long as you didn't
[3203.46s -> 3205.46s]  read about my secret passionate love for
[3205.46s -> 3207.46s]  Drake Redcrest, it's fine.
[3207.46s -> 3210.28s]  Hey, why doesn't Chibi Robo apologize
[3210.28s -> 3213.54s]  himself? Oh, man.
[3213.54s -> 3216.23s]  Apologizing is a vital
[3216.23s -> 3218.23s]  component of the manager's work.
[3218.23s -> 3220.66s]  You're his manager? Seriously?
[3220.66s -> 3222.66s]  Oh, that's kind of weird.
[3222.66s -> 3224.66s]  Hold on. I need to record this moment so I don't
[3224.66s -> 3227.93s]  forget. I'm being mocked
[3227.93s -> 3230.94s]  right now. If I was in the diary, this
[3230.94s -> 3232.94s]  could be a while. I guess I'll be leaving.
[3232.94s -> 3240.04s]  Can I pick anything? What else can I do?
[3240.04s -> 3242.54s]  Anything else with you? Manager.
[3242.54s -> 3244.54s]  I've never heard the word in real life
[3244.54s -> 3246.54s]  before, but it sounds very important.
[3246.54s -> 3248.54s]  Chibi Robo and Tele seem very
[3248.54s -> 3250.54s]  close. It's nice to see good
[3250.54s -> 3252.97s]  friends like that. Also, Drake is
[3252.97s -> 3254.97s]  patrolling the area again. I love the way
[3254.97s -> 3256.97s]  his big boots clump around. It's so manly.
[3256.97s -> 3262.41s]  If Drake does his pose right
[3262.41s -> 3264.41s]  in front of me, I think I'll have to run away.
[3264.41s -> 3267.22s]  I'd be so embarrassed.
[3269.10s -> 3271.10s]  What the fuck is going on?
[3271.10s -> 3279.36s]  Are you trying to peek at my diary again?
[3279.36s -> 3286.02s]  God, you're a big creepo,
[3286.02s -> 3292.86s]  Chibi Robo.
[3292.86s -> 3303.74s]  More trash. Let's get it. Why, this is something
[3303.74s -> 3305.74s]  already plugged in. Can I unplug this?
[3305.74s -> 3314.69s]  Or I can climb it. I can climb up
[3314.69s -> 3330.37s]  that cord. What is that? Record player.
[3330.37s -> 3334.14s]  Should I jump off and die?
[3334.14s -> 3336.14s]  To make sure? What do you think?
[3336.14s -> 3341.38s]  Let's turn this on first.
[3341.38s -> 3345.86s]  It's a little box? What's in the box?
[3345.86s -> 3361.86s]  Wait, you can pull. Should I not have done that?
[3361.86s -> 3367.42s]  Why is it playing, like, drunk
[3367.42s -> 3372.78s]  music?
[3372.78s -> 3374.78s]  I want to pick this up.
[3374.78s -> 3383.04s]  Can I move this?
[3383.04s -> 3385.04s]  Waste time, though. Saving is only used when
[3385.04s -> 3387.04s]  loading from the main menu. You're fine if you never
[3387.04s -> 3389.86s]  close the game.
[3389.86s -> 3391.86s]  What does that mean? S?
[3391.86s -> 3393.86s]  S.
[3393.86s -> 3398.72s]  Chibi Robo?
[3398.72s -> 3400.72s]  Way to go. I think we can call it a day. I'm proud of the work
[3400.72s -> 3403.09s]  we've done. Well, the night has ended.
[3403.09s -> 3405.09s]  Let's return to the Chibi house.
[3410.14s -> 3416.80s]  Good morning.
[3416.80s -> 3418.80s]  Your Chibi ranking is still 782,000.
[3418.80s -> 3420.80s]  In order to get the next
[3420.80s -> 3422.80s]  bonus battery, you need 60 more happy points.
[3422.80s -> 3424.80s]  Get out there and earn more happy
[3424.80s -> 3426.80s]  so that you have to be in bed
[3426.80s -> 3428.80s]  during the day. Let's go.
[3428.80s -> 3430.80s]  Well, stop doing that. You're making
[3430.80s -> 3432.80s]  trash.
[3432.80s -> 3434.80s]  Would you like to save? Yeah, I would.
[3434.80s -> 3442.67s]  Wii options, data management, save data,
[3442.67s -> 3444.67s]  Nintendo GameCube. I already did
[3444.67s -> 3446.67s]  that. We saw that
[3446.67s -> 3448.67s]  it was actually working. And there
[3448.67s -> 3450.67s]  were blocks open. I've done that twice.
[3450.67s -> 3452.67s]  He's not going to work.
[3452.67s -> 3463.09s]  Let's get out here.
[3463.09s -> 3468.53s]  Living room. Let's go.
[3468.53s -> 3470.53s]  Alright, we're going to make happy points.
[3470.53s -> 3481.46s]  What's under here?
[3481.46s -> 3487.73s]  Oh, coins. I gotta climb that.
[3487.73s -> 3494.96s]  Get the trash. I thought that was
[3494.96s -> 3496.96s]  a Pepe face for a second. I was like, what the fuck?
[3496.96s -> 3505.46s]  Alright, let's go up.
[3505.46s -> 3507.46s]  Oh, I have a helicopter, don't I?
[3507.46s -> 3510.02s]  Okay, let's get that out.
[3510.02s -> 3513.60s]  Nice. Alright, put it away.
[3513.60s -> 3516.48s]  I'll just clean up after Dad?
[3516.48s -> 3523.31s]  Wink?
[3523.31s -> 3530.80s]  Alright, I gotta clean up after Dad's mess.
[3530.80s -> 3536.50s]  Alright, good.
[3542.02s -> 3544.26s]  Just go get a lot of happy points, okay?
[3544.26s -> 3547.07s]  Hell, I'm trying to
[3547.07s -> 3549.25s]  pick up the trash.
[3549.25s -> 3552.38s]  Take this cheese crumb.
[3552.38s -> 3556.80s]  Save their marriage.
[3556.80s -> 3558.80s]  Alright, we're doing a trash run
[3558.80s -> 3562.26s]  first, that's important. Candy bag.
[3562.26s -> 3565.26s]  Yep, into the trash.
[3565.26s -> 3569.36s]  Go marry his
[3569.36s -> 3571.92s]  wife. That's not how
[3571.92s -> 3575.63s]  that works.
[3575.63s -> 3579.26s]  Alright, what about
[3579.26s -> 3581.57s]  over here? Can I fly that far?
[3581.57s -> 3585.73s]  Clean up the couch
[3585.73s -> 3587.73s]  though, that's alright. Keep your batteries
[3587.73s -> 3589.73s]  running low. Oh, fuck.
[3589.73s -> 3592.29s]  Your body flashes red. Plug into an outlet, quick.
[3592.29s -> 3597.41s]  Where's the outlets in this god damn
[3597.41s -> 3600.99s]  house? I need an outlet
[3600.99s -> 3606.05s]  right now. Where are your outlets?
[3606.05s -> 3614.30s]  Where the fuck is any of your stuff
[3614.30s -> 3620.64s]  plugged in? There we go.
[3620.64s -> 3626.13s]  Is this a fake outlet?
[3626.13s -> 3656.83s]  Ugh.
[3656.83s -> 3658.83s]  You have 80% iPhone battery.
[3658.83s -> 3662.67s]  Alright, let's go.
[3662.67s -> 3667.15s]  More coins. Are those happy coins?
[3667.15s -> 3669.15s]  Or are they regular coins? Alright, I want to do
[3669.15s -> 3671.90s]  uh, what do I want to do?
[3671.90s -> 3674.85s]  Here's my house. Alright, can I get like a bird's
[3674.85s -> 3676.85s]  eye view? I guess I can look. Wait, wait, there's
[3676.85s -> 3678.85s]  trash under there. Where's the trash can?
[3678.85s -> 3684.10s]  Move
[3684.10s -> 3689.60s]  faster with the plug.
[3689.60s -> 3696.77s]  I give it the trash. It's you?
[3696.77s -> 3698.77s]  What? No, it's not.
[3698.77s -> 3705.55s]  It says put it in the proper
[3705.55s -> 3708.30s]  receptacle. Wait, am I the
[3708.30s -> 3711.25s]  trash? Am I the trash
[3711.25s -> 3713.25s]  can? No, there's a trash can over
[3713.25s -> 3720.61s]  here, right? No, I'm definitely not
[3720.61s -> 3728.80s]  the trash. There's trash right
[3728.80s -> 3732.77s]  here, right? That's trash can.
[3732.77s -> 3736.99s]  Lob it in with A. What?
[3736.99s -> 3739.30s]  Oh, nice.
[3739.30s -> 3742.69s]  That's right, you can also get happy points by
[3742.69s -> 3744.69s]  throwing garbage away. Look at
[3744.69s -> 3751.28s]  all the trash I have. I picked up
[3751.28s -> 3755.57s]  a ton of stuff. Look at all the cheese I
[3755.57s -> 3758.00s]  got. You got a total of 31
[3758.00s -> 3760.00s]  happy points. You got
[3760.00s -> 3762.24s]  310 bucks. Nice.
[3762.24s -> 3764.24s]  All right, it's almost time to go to bed. Let's get some more
[3764.24s -> 3776.59s]  trash. This is a janitor game?
[3776.59s -> 3793.62s]  It's my favorite kind of game. You can
[3793.62s -> 3796.11s]  use an SD card? How
[3796.11s -> 3798.11s]  difficult is it to use? I have an SD card
[3798.11s -> 3800.11s]  somewhere in this house.
[3800.11s -> 3802.11s]  How difficult is that to do?
[3802.11s -> 3804.11s]  Is that like hard to set that
[3804.11s -> 3806.11s]  up? No, you can't.
[3806.11s -> 3808.11s]  Why am I being lied to?
[3808.11s -> 3810.11s]  I can't throw it from here? Wow.
[3810.11s -> 3826.82s]  It has to be modded.
[3826.82s -> 3828.82s]  That's
[3828.82s -> 3830.82s]  way out of my
[3830.82s -> 3834.34s]  jurisdiction.
[3834.34s -> 3842.98s]  What about the girl?
[3842.98s -> 3844.98s]  Just jailbreak your console.
[3844.98s -> 3847.15s]  I feel like that's a day project.
[3847.15s -> 3849.15s]  You don't have to be like an all day project.
[3849.15s -> 3857.34s]  I'm going to jailbreak my Wii today.
[3857.34s -> 3863.74s]  It takes 20 minutes for
[3863.74s -> 3869.25s]  you. Plus, how am I ever going to
[3869.25s -> 3871.25s]  send it back for an official Nintendo
[3871.25s -> 3875.15s]  warranty inspection, guys?
[3875.15s -> 3878.61s]  Ribbit ribbit.
[3878.61s -> 3880.61s]  Can I do anything with this?
[3880.61s -> 3884.26s]  Should I get the frog coins?
[3884.26s -> 3886.56s]  Speaking of coins. All right, it's almost time for bed.
[3886.56s -> 3897.30s]  I got money this time.
[3897.30s -> 3904.02s]  I'm leaving her hanging. Ribbit ribbit.
[3904.02s -> 3907.73s]  She just goes
[3907.73s -> 3909.73s]  and just eats you.
[3909.73s -> 3916.06s]  I can draw ribbit.
[3916.06s -> 3919.52s]  Jenny just gave you 13 happy
[3919.52s -> 3921.52s]  points. Spread the happiness.
[3921.52s -> 3926.45s]  Drop it.
[3926.45s -> 3930.27s]  What are you going to draw?
[3930.27s -> 3933.92s]  Can I help? All right.
[3933.92s -> 3937.82s]  I got to get up here.
[3937.82s -> 3947.30s]  I got to climb on top of the coffee table.
[3947.30s -> 3949.30s]  13 happy points. It's nothing.
[3949.30s -> 3951.30s]  Look at all the shit that's up there. I want to get up here.
[3951.30s -> 3953.30s]  How much time do I have?
[3953.30s -> 3957.26s]  Am I going to PAX? I'm not
[3957.26s -> 3959.63s]  going to PAX. I will not
[3959.63s -> 3961.63s]  be at PAX. Uh oh. Time's up.
[3961.63s -> 3964.13s]  Get the trash quick.
[3964.13s -> 3969.12s]  Aww.
[3969.12s -> 3971.12s]  Chibi Robo. Time sure flies when you're
[3971.12s -> 3973.12s]  making folks happy.
[3973.12s -> 3975.12s]  Well, the day has ended. Let's return to the Chibi house.
[3975.12s -> 3984.45s]  Okay.
[3984.45s -> 3986.45s]  Great work out there.
[3986.45s -> 3988.45s]  Let's adjust your happy point total.
[3988.45s -> 3991.78s]  Your Chibi
[3991.78s -> 3993.78s]  ranking has gone from
[3993.78s -> 3995.78s]  7 to 82. That was a huge
[3995.78s -> 3998.66s]  increase. Good job, Chibi
[3998.66s -> 4000.66s]  Robo. You passed almost half
[4000.66s -> 4002.66s]  a million inactive accounts.
[4002.66s -> 4008.80s]  Great. In order to get the next bonus
[4008.80s -> 4010.80s]  battery, you need 13 more happy points.
[4010.80s -> 4016.18s]  If you ever reach the top of the rankings, you get to
[4016.18s -> 4018.18s]  become super Chibi Robo.
[4018.18s -> 4023.87s]  Super Chibi Frog.
[4023.87s -> 4025.87s]  Well, maybe I'm speaking too soon, but you'll be upgraded to the
[4025.87s -> 4027.87s]  super luxurious super Chibi
[4027.87s -> 4030.69s]  Frog Robo, or that's what I've heard.
[4030.69s -> 4032.69s]  Girlbots won't be able to leave you alone.
[4032.69s -> 4035.06s]  While you're here, Chibi Robo,
[4035.06s -> 4038.00s]  you like to save.
[4038.00s -> 4041.39s]  Maybe one time it'll work.
[4041.39s -> 4043.39s]  You know what I mean? What if it just works one of these times?
[4043.39s -> 4052.86s]  It might just work. I have an idea.
[4052.86s -> 4056.51s]  Format it. Erase all, save, and
[4056.51s -> 4058.51s]  format the data. Okay?
[4058.51s -> 4060.51s]  Memory card's been formatted. Now what if I pull it out?
[4060.51s -> 4065.12s]  Maybe if I pull it out?
[4065.12s -> 4072.16s]  Right?
[4072.16s -> 4074.91s]  Let me try this. Cause it's, oh, it's been formatted.
[4074.91s -> 4078.69s]  Now I'm gonna pull the card out.
[4078.69s -> 4081.70s]  Okay. Alright.
[4081.70s -> 4104.10s]  Now I wonder, does that
[4104.10s -> 4106.10s]  sound the Wii? No, it's the game.
[4106.10s -> 4108.46s]  Try slot B. I can't
[4108.46s -> 4110.46s]  put anything in slot B. The game doesn't recognize
[4110.46s -> 4112.46s]  slot B. You can't save to slot B
[4112.46s -> 4118.74s]  for some reason.
[4118.74s -> 4120.74s]  And this guide says all you have to do...
[4120.74s -> 4122.74s]  Wait, what? This guide says all you have to do is
[4122.74s -> 4124.74s]  download two things.
[4124.74s -> 4128.77s]  Why can't I scroll up anymore?
[4128.77s -> 4135.42s]  Download two things, Monka-esque.
[4135.42s -> 4137.73s]  No, it'll be alright.
[4137.73s -> 4139.73s]  I'll, I'll, I'll
[4139.73s -> 4141.73s]  figure it out. I'm just gonna have to just
[4141.73s -> 4143.73s]  leave it on until tomorrow and then put the
[4143.73s -> 4145.73s]  new card in.
[4145.73s -> 4150.26s]  Or, so after
[4150.26s -> 4152.26s]  when the stream is over, I might
[4152.26s -> 4154.26s]  go figure out how to get
[4154.26s -> 4156.26s]  that saved tonight before I
[4156.26s -> 4158.26s]  go to bed. You know what I'm saying? Like I'm gonna make sure
[4158.26s -> 4160.26s]  this is saved before I go to sleep.
[4160.26s -> 4169.22s]  Just please, for the love of God,
[4169.22s -> 4171.22s]  do not turn off, like,
[4171.22s -> 4175.82s]  the power. I, okay,
[4175.82s -> 4177.82s]  I hope the bill's been paid. It has.
[4177.82s -> 4179.82s]  But one of the, I'm freaking
[4179.82s -> 4181.82s]  up. Can I play a video game?
[4181.82s -> 4183.82s]  Welcome to the Chibi PC.
[4183.82s -> 4186.58s]  Recycletron.
[4186.58s -> 4189.33s]  Living room ladder?
[4189.33s -> 4191.33s]  Collect scrap to build utility bots.
[4191.33s -> 4204.96s]  Okay, how much scrap do I have?
[4204.96s -> 4207.20s]  A ladder that reaches
[4207.20s -> 4209.20s]  high places placed near the Chibi
[4209.20s -> 4211.63s]  Robo house. Build it.
[4211.63s -> 4213.63s]  I don't have any, oh, I don't have any scraps.
[4213.63s -> 4215.63s]  Online shop.
[4215.63s -> 4217.63s]  Timer 10, timer 15.
[4217.63s -> 4219.63s]  Pink flower seeds,
[4219.63s -> 4221.63s]  Chibi blaster. Oh, this is
[4221.63s -> 4223.63s]  cool. Alright, I don't have any money.
[4223.63s -> 4231.82s]  I don't have any points.
[4231.82s -> 4235.47s]  There are game over screens.
[4235.47s -> 4237.97s]  This is a ticking time bump.
[4237.97s -> 4239.97s]  There are game over screens that require a load.
[4239.97s -> 4242.72s]  You're gonna be very sad.
[4242.72s -> 4244.72s]  Uh...
[4244.72s -> 4252.08s]  No, don't say this.
[4252.08s -> 4267.62s]  Hold on.
[4267.62s -> 4269.62s]  Empty SD card, SD card reader for PC.
[4269.62s -> 4274.99s]  Download
[4274.99s -> 4276.99s]  Banner Bomb 2
[4276.99s -> 4278.99s]  from the download link.
[4278.99s -> 4283.73s]  Alright, I
[4283.73s -> 4286.54s]  can't do this right now.
[4286.54s -> 4297.30s]  That's not a virus.
[4297.30s -> 4299.30s]  I know, I know. Alright, I gotta
[4299.30s -> 4302.50s]  figure out what the fuck I wanna do here.
[4302.50s -> 4313.81s]  Um, shit. Okay.
[4313.81s -> 4317.38s]  I have an idea. I have an idea.
[4317.38s -> 4319.94s]  Let me just check something
[4319.94s -> 4329.47s]  real quick. Just play another game.
[4329.47s -> 4331.71s]  Yeah, we might have to come back
[4331.71s -> 4333.71s]  to this. I don't, I don't wanna
[4333.71s -> 4335.71s]  fuck this up. I don't wanna fuck this up.
[4335.71s -> 4338.34s]  We might
[4338.34s -> 4342.30s]  have to come back to this. I really
[4342.30s -> 4344.30s]  wanna play this. We might have to do this like tomorrow.
[4344.30s -> 4346.30s]  Ah, I really wanna play this.
[4346.30s -> 4355.50s]  Hold on, just a second.
[4355.50s -> 4357.50s]  I am very, very
[4357.50s -> 4359.50s]  confused because I remember
[4359.50s -> 4361.50s]  specifically playing
[4361.50s -> 4364.90s]  played Viewtiful Joe
[4364.90s -> 4367.65s]  on this system and used
[4367.65s -> 4369.65s]  this memory card for like
[4369.65s -> 4371.65s]  10 seconds to test the, to see
[4371.65s -> 4373.65s]  if it makes sure things worked. And it worked.
[4373.65s -> 4384.27s]  It'll still be here, don't spoil
[4384.27s -> 4388.75s]  the experience. Yeah, just
[4388.75s -> 4390.75s]  emulate it. Alright, that's not
[4390.75s -> 4392.75s]  just go download an ISO
[4392.75s -> 4394.75s]  of 5 parts of Chibi Robo and
[4394.75s -> 4396.75s]  combine them illegally and then use it.
[4396.75s -> 4398.75s]  That's gonna take like
[4398.75s -> 4400.75s]  half an hour for me to do that.
[4400.75s -> 4407.98s]  That's not something I can do right now.
[4407.98s -> 4414.38s]  Every place that has emulation
[4414.38s -> 4416.38s]  they, it's the download, they
[4416.38s -> 4418.38s]  like throttle you download and shit.
[4418.38s -> 4420.38s]  Trust me, I know. You download
[4420.38s -> 4422.38s]  from all these websites at like 600k
[4422.38s -> 4432.29s]  a second. Alright.
[4432.29s -> 4434.29s]  Alright, I'm ripping the Band-Aid off. I have to.
[4434.29s -> 4436.29s]  The Band-Aid's coming off. I'm gonna
[4436.29s -> 4438.29s]  put in Viewtiful Joe. And I'm gonna
[4438.29s -> 4440.29s]  see if this, what the fuck is going on here.
[4440.29s -> 4442.29s]  I'm ripping the Band-Aid off. I'll play this another day.
[4442.29s -> 4444.29s]  I can't, I already love the game.
[4444.29s -> 4446.29s]  I don't want to fucking tarnish it. I want to play it for real.
[4459.97s -> 4461.97s]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I really, I'm sorry
[4461.97s -> 4463.97s]  guys. I, we're gonna change
[4463.97s -> 4465.97s]  to something else. Give me one second. Let me just
[4465.97s -> 4467.97s]  I'm gonna put in Viewtiful Joe.
[4467.97s -> 4469.97s]  Viewtiful Joe is fucking equally as incredible.
[4469.97s -> 4471.97s]  And I think it does save to this card. Cause I
[4471.97s -> 4473.97s]  used it. Hold on.
[4473.97s -> 4476.27s]  I'll be right back. Fuck!
