[0.95s -> 14.22s]  Can you hear me? All right. Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? How are you?
[15.98s -> 26.54s]  Oh, early. No, I am. I'm a full hour late. And one could even argue I'm two days late.
[27.93s -> 36.87s]  But I'm here. I am now officially fully vaccinated. So I hope I don't have any side effects in the
[36.87s -> 40.95s]  middle of the stream. That's kind of why I said it's going to be maybe three hours.
[41.99s -> 51.94s]  Because we'll see. I'm anxiously anticipating what that's going to look like.
[56.79s -> 66.46s]  What'd you say about my testicles? Fully vaccinated. I don't know. You said something
[66.46s -> 70.70s]  about like my testicles after being vaccinated. I don't know. I have no idea what you meant by that.
[70.70s -> 83.11s]  I didn't even read the whole thing. Remember just pretend that the vaccine is the reason you're
[83.11s -> 90.02s]  acting zonked. Yeah, I have a few things to talk about. Well, one in particular.
[90.02s -> 94.18s]  Thursday. Well, let's just wait, wait, wait, wait, we got to wait. Did I even tweet anything? I
[94.18s -> 158.10s]  didn't tweet anything. Hold on. Give me a second. Let me tweet something. Be right back. So today,
[158.10s -> 162.18s]  this is going to be the last. This is going to be the last day of VR for a little while.
[163.30s -> 168.34s]  I have to put this in a box for a little bit. Some of you probably have known by the amount
[168.34s -> 176.57s]  of times I have taken in between these days. VR seems to royally fuck me up. Something about
[176.57s -> 182.57s]  holding my arms up for more than a few hours. Even with the brace on, it just fucking annihilates
[182.57s -> 188.33s]  me. So we're going to put it away for a little while. I'm probably going to do more seated VR
[188.33s -> 193.05s]  in the future. I'm not going to do seated VR today because the whole goddamn living room has
[193.05s -> 199.29s]  been cleared. And like this would have been a waste of time if I didn't utilize the living
[199.29s -> 207.24s]  room space. And I mean, I'll be fine. I got my brace on. I'll be all right. But let's talk about
[207.24s -> 215.51s]  some announcements. This Thursday, so in a couple days, Ludwig and I are going to be hosting a
[215.51s -> 221.75s]  battleship tournament, which we will be participating in as well. I'm not going to make any bets.
[221.75s -> 226.54s]  If I lose, I'm just going to fucking walk away and lose. We're not adding anything. I'm not doing
[226.54s -> 232.86s]  anything. No, if I'm out, I'm just out of the tournament. That's it. So that's going to be on
[232.86s -> 237.34s]  Ludwig's channel. I'll be hosting him and I'll be part of the commentator team.
[238.30s -> 244.38s]  And then this weekend on Sunday, you don't want to miss that one. I just want to let you know ahead
[244.38s -> 255.77s]  of time. I'm going to be making a very, very large announcement on Sunday. So if there's a stream
[255.77s -> 261.13s]  that you might want to participate in, at least for a little while, is the announcement of the
[261.13s -> 272.20s]  announcement stream. Here it is. That's on the 1st. It's not Catboy. Nope. Oh no, it is not Catboy.
[274.36s -> 283.08s]  Just wait until you fucking know what that is. It's not Catboy. No, it's not. Trust me. This is
[283.08s -> 290.09s]  something. Whatever. I'll see you on Sunday. We'll be back actually sitting down at the chair.
[291.05s -> 299.19s]  Regular setup. But I think we can go here. I don't need to delay anymore. I've already
[299.19s -> 304.49s]  delayed enough. In the event that I start to get like a massive headache or something from this
[304.49s -> 311.05s]  vaccine, I'm just going to run away. I'm going to be like, guys, bye. And I'm going to immediately
[311.05s -> 313.85s]  lie down. I'm going to do like the Undertaker in my bed. I'm just going to lie down and just stay
[313.85s -> 349.77s]  straight. Let's turn the camera on. What do you say? This is Medal of Honor Andy.
[353.26s -> 365.51s]  What? The name of the game is Medal of Honor Andy. I hope you guys are ready. They may as well.
[365.51s -> 373.75s]  Honest to God, seriously, at this point, like you may, what am I connected to here? Medal of
[373.75s -> 383.14s]  Honor Andy is the name of this game, I guess. All right. Can you guys hear it? Is a good sound for
[383.14s -> 388.82s]  you? Does it sound good? Because I'm ready to go. This is the, this is the one I remember like E3,
[390.60s -> 395.90s]  maybe two E3s ago or last E3 from last year. I remember seeing this game being announced and
[395.90s -> 401.19s]  I was like, holy shit, I can't wait to play this. So I'm actually pretty excited to play this game.
[401.19s -> 411.48s]  Should I be excited? This game sucks, by the way. Glad that's the first thing that I read.
[411.48s -> 419.54s]  All right, let's go. Here we go. Medal of Honor Andy. Am I in the right place? Why is it? I haven't
[419.54s -> 428.18s]  turned around that many times, have I? Oh my God, that just scared the shit out of me.
[433.08s -> 441.00s]  I feel pretty good. Do you not know what this is? This is universal for I'm doing just fine.
[446.60s -> 458.70s]  Okay. Am I supposed to be sitting down? Oh shit. Grab the pistol and shoot. Who, you?
[459.50s -> 476.14s]  I feel great, captain.
[478.94s -> 479.42s]  Watch out.
[489.56s -> 494.44s]  Is that Harry Potter? Grab the pistol and shoot. Look out. There's a bad guy.
[503.29s -> 508.01s]  It's gonna, it's gonna take me like a half an hour to get out of this fucking tutorial.
[512.68s -> 520.86s]  All right, I promise I won't do it again. I'm not going to do it again. Why can you do that?
[533.00s -> 547.99s]  Um, got him. I'm putting it down. Why can you do that? What? Where did that guy even come from?
[547.99s -> 554.23s]  Was that guy flying? That guy was in like a, one of those squirrel suits. Get that. I don't, don't,
[554.47s -> 572.41s]  hey, he's like pointing at my head. He was up. No, where was he? I love how my head is just in here.
[572.41s -> 584.30s]  All the way. I gotta do. Good morning, Lieutenant. Welcome back to the land. You've been through a
[584.30s -> 590.70s]  lot. So I'll keep it brief. I'm with the office of strategic services. Our mission is subversion
[590.70s -> 594.14s]  and everything in between. How's the audio? Can you hear it? We're taking the fight to the Nazis.
[594.78s -> 605.05s]  Can't hear it. There you go. We do some of the most dangerous work of the war. We're looking
[605.05s -> 609.29s]  for people just like you. Can I have that hat? Now the sergeant and I go way back.
[609.29s -> 615.64s]  They're like all around me. It's weird. What you did in Tunisia. He's nominated you for the
[615.64s -> 623.85s]  medal of honor. Trust me, Lieutenant. I hate doing paperwork, but in your case, I'm in an exception.
[624.95s -> 631.11s]  You saved our lives. You're welcome. Thank you. You guys did good too. Life is usually a pageant of
[631.11s -> 636.15s]  idiots and fools, but occasionally you find yourself in the company of good people
[636.71s -> 643.06s]  and then anything is possible. Lieutenant, you are now going to hear the most important question
[643.06s -> 650.82s]  I can ask. Would you like to join the OSS? Give a thumbs up or thumbs down to proceed. What would
[650.82s -> 661.93s]  I like to? Should I join thumbs down? I don't think so. Not today. I understand, Lieutenant.
[661.93s -> 665.37s]  As soon as you're back on your feet, we'll have you on a transport for New York.
[666.86s -> 674.42s]  Game over. Wait, is that it? Did I speed run losing the game?
[676.49s -> 699.83s]  That's the end of the game. Are you kidding me? What do I do now? What is this?
[700.79s -> 712.98s]  Gallery? Introduction to the gallery. What is going on? How do I? Go back 10 seconds. How do I?
[712.98s -> 729.06s]  What do I do? Can I go over there? Main menu. What happened? Missions. Stay alive. Okay,
[729.06s -> 742.66s]  this is where we go. Right here. Welcome to the OSS. I want to join it. Okay, here we go. Yes,
[742.66s -> 748.79s]  I would like to join. I'm joining the OSS. Thank you. Why is there a gun here?
[748.79s -> 758.12s]  Lieutenant, I'm Dr. Thatch. Welcome to the infirmary. We'll have you back on your feet
[758.12s -> 762.36s]  in no time. Come on, blink again. I know you're having some trouble speaking after what happened.
[762.36s -> 765.48s]  No, blink again. I want to change my- Let's just use hand gestures, eh?
[765.48s -> 770.55s]  Whatever. Welcome to the infirmary. You can set your game options in this interactive mode. You
[770.55s -> 775.24s]  can also do it anytime. Okay, whatever. Interactive exam? Sure. How delightful.
[775.24s -> 781.69s]  Going to ask you a series of questions. And don't worry, you can change your answers at any time.
[782.49s -> 788.65s]  Now, my first question is an easy one, Lieutenant. Are you left or right-handed? Please,
[788.65s -> 794.74s]  make your choice. I am right-handed. Ah, fantastic. Use the gun. I can't.
[794.74s -> 799.38s]  Let's confirm your fine motor skills. Please, pick up the service weapon next to you.
[799.38s -> 805.94s]  No. No. No. No. No. Yes.
[805.94s -> 809.88s]  Splendid. Now, give me a thumbs up if you're ready to continue,
[809.88s -> 812.44s]  or a thumbs down if you want to change your selection.
[814.55s -> 818.15s]  No, that's fine. I like that. Well done, Lieutenant. On to the next question.
[819.43s -> 821.91s]  We put blanks in your gun because you're a psycho.
[821.91s -> 828.63s]  Combat zone. Whenever you're in close proximity to an explosion, you might feel a concussive blast.
[828.63s -> 832.07s]  The technicians call it camera shake. Turn that off immediately.
[832.07s -> 835.43s]  You can also feel this camera shake phenomenon when firing your weapon.
[836.31s -> 841.19s]  But through the wonders of modern medicine, I can easily adjust how much camera shake you feel.
[841.19s -> 843.27s]  I want zero. Let me know your preference.
[844.84s -> 850.38s]  Zero. None. The worst thing to put in any game. Why don't you test fire your weapon?
[850.86s -> 856.47s]  Yeah, why would you want camera shake? Now, if you're happy with your choice,
[856.47s -> 861.27s]  please give me a thumbs up. If you'd like to choose again, give me a thumbs down.
[861.27s -> 864.55s]  This game lets you kill the soldiers in the prologue, but not the doctor.
[866.97s -> 869.85s]  Jolly good, Lieutenant. On to the next question.
[870.57s -> 877.83s]  I was very jarring that you could do that. Now, let's discuss how you want to view an enemy's
[877.83s -> 885.82s]  threat level. See the two imaginary enemies in front of you?
[886.38s -> 889.18s]  Note how their threat level is indicated above their head.
[889.18s -> 892.78s]  Their threat levels? The stars they have, the bigger the threat.
[893.34s -> 896.70s]  An enemy with one star should be easy for you to dispatch.
[896.70s -> 899.18s]  Is this like World of Warcraft zones?
[900.60s -> 906.12s]  Seeing an enemy's threat level from a distance gives you the chance to adjust your tactics.
[906.12s -> 908.36s]  I have a question. If I shoot him in the head, it still kills him, right?
[909.85s -> 912.81s]  Some of the technicians in the back say this affects immersion.
[912.81s -> 914.73s]  I just burped and I hope you all heard it, but I don't.
[914.73s -> 916.33s]  It never floats your boat, I say.
[917.13s -> 920.73s]  Lieutenant, please choose if you'd like to see the enemy threat level.
[920.73s -> 924.68s]  What do you think? No? I don't think so, right?
[924.68s -> 926.36s]  I'm skipping the checkup. Get me out of here.
[927.16s -> 931.00s]  I am always here, Lieutenant, so please come back anytime.
[931.00s -> 935.56s]  You can access my office through the main menu. Good luck and Tally-ho.
[935.56s -> 942.90s]  Tally-ho. Firing Ranger.
[942.90s -> 943.94s]  All right, this one we're going to learn how to play.
[944.50s -> 949.30s]  Remember, every VR game wants you to see how cool they have their reload feature.
[949.86s -> 958.89s]  Now that you're back, we should give you an objective as well.
[958.89s -> 960.25s]  Oh my god, that was cool.
[960.25s -> 964.18s]  All right, right sleeve is current objective. Follow the tutorial prompts.
[964.18s -> 976.87s]  Okay. Cool.
[982.18s -> 982.90s]  That feels pretty good.
[988.78s -> 1002.47s]  I like that a lot. Okay.
[1002.47s -> 1005.13s]  Controls are pretty good. I'm going to give it that.
[1005.13s -> 1006.01s]  The controls are pretty good.
[1006.65s -> 1011.26s]  He hates the game that in any game that's not Alex.
[1013.18s -> 1016.30s]  That's not true, but it is a little bit.
[1020.25s -> 1021.29s]  I have basic training down here.
[1028.63s -> 1033.06s]  Oh, cool. What do we got?
[1037.94s -> 1038.98s]  Why are you so much bigger than me?
[1043.56s -> 1050.02s]  Press this button.
[1051.96s -> 1053.48s]  Oh, okay. That's pretty fun.
[1065.78s -> 1067.22s]  I'm not going to shoot him. All right.
[1069.19s -> 1069.83s]  Oh, sick.
[1070.89s -> 1079.42s]  Oh, this actually I like this.
[1080.06s -> 1086.95s]  All right, reach over the shoulder and grab.
[1087.75s -> 1094.41s]  Oh, fuck. Okay.
[1094.41s -> 1098.12s]  Grab the SMG. This is not an SMG.
[1098.12s -> 1101.03s]  How do I get my SMG?
[1101.67s -> 1102.23s]  Oh, there we go.
[1102.87s -> 1110.86s]  You had to do it with two hands.
[1111.50s -> 1121.21s]  Okay. Let me help you.
[1121.93s -> 1129.64s]  We shouldn't be standing this close.
[1129.64s -> 1145.38s]  Okay. Okay. Put this in.
[1152.54s -> 1155.58s]  You shouldn't be this close to your ears would be bleeding right now.
[1155.58s -> 1161.96s]  How are your ears not bleeding?
[1161.96s -> 1165.18s]  What? Don't. All right. I'm fine.
[1165.18s -> 1166.86s]  All right. Next station over here.
[1175.48s -> 1183.98s]  I've got to be fair.
[1186.87s -> 1187.59s]  I've got to be fair.
[1190.26s -> 1192.90s]  Probably out of all the games I've played in VR so far,
[1192.90s -> 1195.90s]  all of them that includes Alex.
[1195.90s -> 1198.89s]  It's it's this is this works.
[1201.54s -> 1203.30s]  This this this works. It works.
[1203.30s -> 1204.50s]  It works just fine.
[1204.50s -> 1206.73s]  And I don't I have no problem with it.
[1206.73s -> 1207.53s]  It works.
[1207.53s -> 1218.15s]  The box. Here we go.
[1236.20s -> 1236.84s]  How do you do it?
[1240.54s -> 1242.62s]  Okay. How do you reload it though?
[1242.62s -> 1245.98s]  So I can get mad at chat for getting mad at me two days ago.
[1245.98s -> 1249.51s]  How do you do it?
[1249.51s -> 1252.07s]  Okay. So I people have people are fucking furious
[1252.07s -> 1253.27s]  because I was using my left hand.
[1253.27s -> 1253.75s]  Let me see.
[1256.25s -> 1257.37s]  No, it doesn't work like that.
[1257.37s -> 1257.77s]  Hold on.
[1261.85s -> 1277.08s]  Okay. I like them both.
[1277.08s -> 1284.74s]  You can have this med kit.
[1307.11s -> 1308.87s]  Simulate a grave injury.
[1314.12s -> 1316.52s]  Sorry, I didn't press the button fast enough to make you get hurt.
[1321.22s -> 1328.78s]  The syringe will inject the medicine.
[1328.78s -> 1331.58s]  You can store up to three first aid syringes.
[1331.58s -> 1332.54s]  Where?
[1332.54s -> 1333.02s]  My cuff.
[1334.84s -> 1338.41s]  Ooh, I like that.
[1338.41s -> 1341.19s]  I you got to give him credit where credit is due.
[1341.19s -> 1342.36s]  You have to.
[1342.36s -> 1343.16s]  I'm giving him credit.
[1343.16s -> 1345.38s]  Everyone said this game sucks.
[1345.38s -> 1351.02s]  So far, this is very fluid, easy to grab shit.
[1351.02s -> 1352.87s]  Nothing fucking freaks out.
[1352.87s -> 1353.91s]  I like it.
[1353.91s -> 1357.90s]  I might change my mind in like 10 minutes.
[1357.90s -> 1358.78s]  This is very important.
[1358.78s -> 1359.58s]  How cool the grenades.
[1364.34s -> 1365.14s]  What?
[1365.14s -> 1368.95s]  What?
[1368.95s -> 1373.30s]  I'm hope.
[1373.30s -> 1376.92s]  I thought if I hold the thing down, it doesn't.
[1376.92s -> 1377.88s]  Oh, a shtylen.
[1378.68s -> 1379.40s]  A shtylen.
[1380.79s -> 1381.59s]  Does it count down?
[1383.53s -> 1384.57s]  Why was it not counting down?
[1385.21s -> 1386.97s]  Did you see it was counting down before?
[1386.97s -> 1388.25s]  It was like three, two.
[1388.25s -> 1389.13s]  Oh, okay.
[1399.42s -> 1400.30s]  What about the shtylen?
[1409.02s -> 1409.50s]  You can.
[1420.07s -> 1425.11s]  Oh, are we all right?
[1425.91s -> 1426.87s]  It stuck on me.
[1426.87s -> 1427.67s]  Get it off me.
[1427.67s -> 1428.31s]  Get it off me.
[1428.31s -> 1428.87s]  Get it off me.
[1428.87s -> 1429.91s]  It's stuck on me.
[1429.91s -> 1430.87s]  Oh, no, it's all right.
[1430.87s -> 1431.43s]  Is it open?
[1431.43s -> 1431.91s]  No, it is.
[1432.55s -> 1435.48s]  All right, we're fine.
[1438.26s -> 1438.98s]  Practice range.
[1439.54s -> 1447.38s]  Cat puke.
[1448.50s -> 1449.94s]  Where am I going?
[1449.94s -> 1458.89s]  This way?
[1458.89s -> 1459.29s]  All right.
[1469.05s -> 1469.85s]  Are these people?
[1469.85s -> 1471.13s]  Wait, why are there people here?
[1471.85s -> 1474.90s]  Why do we have these guys like just walking around?
[1478.89s -> 1480.41s]  Why do we have humans?
[1481.21s -> 1492.14s]  A guy in the back.
[1492.14s -> 1492.70s]  Check this out.
[1493.58s -> 1510.28s]  I want another grenade.
[1510.28s -> 1510.52s]  Full.
[1520.18s -> 1520.58s]  There we go.
[1520.58s -> 1525.11s]  You got to do it like sidearm.
[1525.11s -> 1525.51s]  Yes.
[1525.51s -> 1526.31s]  All right, that's fun.
[1526.31s -> 1526.81s]  Cool.

[1567.16s -> 1568.04s]  I'm 23.
[1568.68s -> 1569.18s]  23?
[1572.92s -> 1573.42s]  Oh, sht.

[1579.80s -> 1580.52s]  Oh, sht.
[1580.52s -> 1581.16s]  I fucked it up.
[1581.16s -> 1582.44s]  I want to do this for sure.
[1582.44s -> 1584.70s]  The Nazis didn't bomb Abilene, Texas.
[1584.70s -> 1585.82s]  They bombed London, England.
[1586.78s -> 1589.00s]  They destroyed my home.
[1589.00s -> 1591.08s]  They burned my entire life to the ground.
[1591.08s -> 1593.64s]  And now I want to do the same thing to the Third Reich.
[1593.64s -> 1598.75s]  Way to get to the front.
[1598.75s -> 1600.62s]  How do you think I got to Tunisia?
[1601.34s -> 1604.73s]  Forging transfer orders has become a hobby of mine.
[1604.73s -> 1607.08s]  Make it to France.
[1609.05s -> 1610.73s]  No, you're finally awake.
[1610.73s -> 1611.45s]  Harry Potter.
[1611.45s -> 1612.17s]  That's what I said.
[1612.17s -> 1613.05s]  Don't worry, Ali.
[1613.05s -> 1614.33s]  Your secret's safe.
[1614.33s -> 1614.83s]  What does it say?
[1614.83s -> 1616.81s]  I'm pretty sure the lieutenant isn't going to say anything.
[1617.53s -> 1619.42s]  Thank you, Sarge.
[1619.42s -> 1627.05s]  Get down and do exactly what I say.
[1627.85s -> 1630.01s]  I need the next part of the game to load in the right spot.
[1630.01s -> 1631.29s]  So I'm going to go this way.
[1631.29s -> 1644.27s]  OK, I don't care.
[1644.83s -> 1656.91s]  I'm trying.
[1656.91s -> 1660.27s]  The game needs to load correctly when this cutscene's over.
[1660.27s -> 1661.13s]  See?
[1661.13s -> 1661.61s]  You know what I mean?
[1661.61s -> 1668.35s]  I have to be standing in the right spot.
[1668.35s -> 1668.85s]  All right.
[1668.85s -> 1671.02s]  I'm training and tests.
[1671.02s -> 1676.38s]  It's time to go after the Nazis.
[1676.38s -> 1677.18s]  Yes, sir.
[1677.18s -> 1677.90s]  His shoulders.
[1677.90s -> 1679.18s]  Your first mission is to make contact with the enemy.
[1679.18s -> 1681.26s]  I just gave that guy like a spine problem.
[1681.26s -> 1684.86s]  The cell led by Mendeleev has been destroyed.
[1684.86s -> 1685.66s]  Wait, you mean this thing?
[1686.54s -> 1690.89s]  Your rendezvous will be along the lines of the St. Catherine legion.
[1690.89s -> 1696.00s]  The resistance will give you a signal when it's safe to come ashore.
[1696.00s -> 1698.16s]  You'll have three days to assist the resistance,
[1698.16s -> 1700.28s]  the intelligence and German activity,
[1700.28s -> 1702.12s]  and sabotage targets of opportunity.
[1702.92s -> 1706.54s]  I'm talking about a small communications relay or a fuel truck.
[1706.54s -> 1707.50s]  I feel like one of the Muppets.
[1708.46s -> 1710.06s]  But it has like the real human hands.
[1710.06s -> 1710.46s]  You know what I mean?
[1710.46s -> 1712.14s]  They're always kind of like moving their fingers and stuff.
[1713.02s -> 1714.38s]  It's like the Swedish chef.
[1714.38s -> 1716.94s]  Now I want to introduce you to Huxley, our quartermaster.
[1716.94s -> 1717.42s]  Where is he?
[1717.42s -> 1718.78s]  She'll get you set up with what you need.
[1719.58s -> 1720.70s]  That's Huxley over there?
[1720.70s -> 1721.90s]  Oh, excellent.
[1721.90s -> 1722.46s]  Good to know.

[2494.54s -> 2504.84s]  that too some spigot guns in strategic spots and our people positioned along
[2504.84s -> 2511.02s]  the road we have to be yeah so they brought along a one-to-one full model
[2511.02s -> 2517.67s]  this whole mission but why do they bring it here return it let's put the plan

[2569.48s -> 2574.82s]  be placed well I think to be a little bit we get the most out of this explosion
[2574.82s -> 2578.18s]  I think Ollie should be probably somewhere in this vicinity right here
[2578.18s -> 2583.79s]  you know what I mean right right over there Ollie I think you should be right
[2583.79s -> 2588.07s]  next to the explosives I think that's a perfect view of the the convoy coming
[2588.07s -> 2594.42s]  out of there yeah it's coming out of there I'll back you up Juliet a perfect
[2594.42s -> 2598.42s]  example we also need you to be able to pack up Ollie so if Ollie's gonna be

[2603.67s -> 2608.16s]  Sarge you're gonna need to back up Juliet because she's gonna be focusing
[2608.16s -> 2611.92s]  on backing up Ollie I would assume you'd have to be probably right over here
