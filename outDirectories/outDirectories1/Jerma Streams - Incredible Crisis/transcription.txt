[0.63s -> 9.43s]  Guys, it's very easy to be early when the stream starts normally four hours ago.
[9.43s -> 12.95s]  It's easy to be early when you're four hours late.
[16.89s -> 21.37s]  How are you guys doing? Doing well? Hope your day's going well.
[23.93s -> 34.07s]  My day's going real well. I got out of physical therapy.
[35.35s -> 44.44s]  Got some info. I'm a little tight. It's all right. We did a nice consultation.
[44.44s -> 48.04s]  Find out what we're gonna do going forward. Now I'm gonna go two plus days a week.
[49.22s -> 63.21s]  Let's go. Today, we're gonna be playing Incredible Crisis for the PlayStation 1.
[63.85s -> 68.79s]  The reason why we're gonna do this is because this game is a short,
[69.59s -> 73.22s]  albeit incredibly interesting experience from what I've told.
[73.94s -> 82.10s]  It's kind of a rhythm game, but not... I think the whole game is just fucking weird.
[82.10s -> 89.86s]  Because we're starting so late, this stream is gonna be only probably a few hours long,
[89.86s -> 95.32s]  so we don't go until like 12, 1 a.m. Pacific, and we'll be back tomorrow.
[96.20s -> 99.32s]  I did want to get something in here. I didn't want to just not stream today.
[99.32s -> 108.09s]  I wanted to stream because I like streaming. I like streaming. Quick, do a funny grandma voice.
[110.81s -> 121.86s]  That was perfect for what you're asking me to do. We got a wink.
[122.82s -> 129.00s]  That was a left funny grandma voice. I can do a funny grandma voice,
[129.00s -> 136.70s]  but that's not what you asked me to do. I had specific instructions. Wink for us already.
[136.70s -> 141.74s]  Hold on a second. I'm getting there. Just wait. Let's wait. Let people trickle in.
[147.94s -> 151.46s]  Hurry up. You're a con artist. Hold on. I'm doing fine.
[151.46s -> 156.46s]  But you didn't ask me how I was doing. Hurry up. How was your day? I'm doing good.
[159.51s -> 162.79s]  All right. You want me to quell this whole thing for you? Do you care more about wink
[163.35s -> 190.01s]  or do you care more about dog on screen? It's me being like, chewing on my tongue.
[193.13s -> 198.81s]  We're getting angry. I tell you, this thing's gonna get me in trouble.
[201.42s -> 217.14s]  I was like, more blink than wink. Hold on. I got you. Hold on. There. Use it. Print it.
[217.14s -> 228.07s]  Edit it. All right. You guys ready? I want to say, what's the MOBA? What's the MOBA that they made
[228.07s -> 232.23s]  and they patched it like 10 times and it got to a point where it was 1.0 and then they closed it?
[236.17s -> 242.01s]  Incredible Crisis. What was Infinite Crisis? Yes, that's the one.
[243.75s -> 247.91s]  Yes. Infinite Crisis is the game that got into 1.0 finally and then they closed the servers.
[248.87s -> 253.86s]  The family guy online. What the heck? What are you talking about?
[255.78s -> 263.93s]  All right. You guys ready? You can make a move around. This is awesome.
[264.49s -> 285.05s]  Here comes Incredible Crisis against the dog bones. Presents what? They present, but like
[285.05s -> 298.49s]  it's developed by Polygon Magic. Music by Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra. This is on PlayStation 1,
[298.49s -> 309.27s]  by the way. Is there a voiceover or anything? Please have a face. Two moons when I was Earth.
[309.27s -> 345.51s]  Here comes the ant. You all know it's my birthday today. What? Birthday? Yeah, that's right.
[346.23s -> 355.80s]  I'll make your favorite dinner. It really is that family. It's 3D movie making. Not again.
[355.80s -> 361.48s]  It's the same family. Not again. Of course. Brad movie's free. That's my reason for living.
[363.83s -> 375.88s]  Happy birthday, grandma. I want everyone home early today. Who just opened that?
[376.28s -> 386.62s]  Who just closed that? Take an ice cream. Michael got old. Story of Taneo chapter 1. Goodbye. I
[386.62s -> 401.13s]  missed it. Whatever it said. Where's this? Okay. What are they doing with another Earth?
[407.93s -> 427.69s]  Daydreaming? Time to exercise. Wait, the office is. I mean time to. Taneo dance fever. Okay. Okay.
[427.69s -> 431.77s]  Hold on. Okay, everybody. Let's do some exercise to relieve the day's stress.
[434.70s -> 438.94s]  Let's dance. Press buttons and direction buttons as shown. Make a mistake. You're
[439.58s -> 443.82s]  fired. Your skill level goes down. Perfect dance. Your skill level goes up. This
[443.82s -> 468.41s]  game cannot be paused. Push what? Push what? What is that? Oh, what was that wrong? I did it wrong.
[469.05s -> 481.26s]  That's good, Taneo. Good job. This is why it takes so long for somebody at Comcast to answer
[481.26s -> 501.43s]  the phone. Is this what people do at the office? Holy shit. Hang in there, Taneo. How am I doing
[501.43s -> 524.68s]  this wrong? What? You're doing great. What's on your resume? You know, I got my master's in
[524.68s -> 544.02s]  business engineering. I sold brick. What? I already love this game. Okay, now I'm killing it.
[548.44s -> 556.10s]  All right, so when does the trap door open underneath the person that did the worst?
[556.98s -> 579.58s]  You've pleased me. Back to work. Hey, well, that was fun. They do this every day. What? What the
[579.58s -> 599.50s]  fuck? Holy shit. Bowling inferno? What? I thought we were dancing. Avoid the iron ball. In the
[599.50s -> 606.14s]  distance, meter turns red. Run with X. Make sure you have enough energy drink. When running, use up
[606.14s -> 615.91s]  and down directional buttons to avoid obstacles. What? I'm going to be being followed by a ball?
[619.32s -> 628.42s]  Wait, what do I have to do? I'm tapping, right? I'm tapping. I'm tapping. How much do I have to
[628.42s -> 658.73s]  tap? I didn't... Avoid the iron ball. If the distance meter turns red, run with X button.
[659.37s -> 678.22s]  So don't do anything until it's red. Okay, let's go. I have to have enough energy drink.
[679.02s -> 685.19s]  All right, I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. Oh shit, I have to pay attention to that too.
[686.15s -> 697.30s]  All right, we're good. All right, same deal. Oh, fuck. It's going to hit me. All right, we're good.
[698.20s -> 719.22s]  Got it. That was interesting. Elevator of doom. First try. I made it. Phew.
[724.23s -> 731.16s]  Wouldn't the... Is it going to open and the ball's going to be there? Excellent. Is this an emulator?
[731.16s -> 745.11s]  No. Oh, it's like trying to get me. It's following me around. Why is it doing this? Stop the elevator.
[745.11s -> 750.49s]  Break it with X button. Stop it before the counter hits zero. Use directional buttons to avoid
[750.49s -> 758.36s]  falling objects. Blue meter indicates breaking power. I'm confused. Stop when it gets to zero.
[760.95s -> 778.22s]  Use directional button. Oh, okay. I get it. Stop it at zero? Mash A? Wait, stop it now?
[779.26s -> 796.81s]  Who's dropping bots and fans at me? The people have thrown rocks at me. I can't laugh. Hold on.
[796.81s -> 805.83s]  I can't laugh and play this. Oh, it's too many. Hold on. I got to get the... Hold on. I know what
[805.83s -> 830.17s]  to do now. Okay. There's a lot going on. Stop it. Break it with X. Stop it before it hits zero.
[830.17s -> 837.26s]  When it hits zero. This is not a superhero movie. Okay. Here we go. I'll get this right now. You
[837.26s -> 862.66s]  ready? Why is it not registering these? I'm doing it too fast again. There we go. I'm literally
[862.66s -> 876.09s]  pressing it too fast for it to register. I was going like... Like, you know, I can do it if the
[876.09s -> 911.91s]  game wouldn't register it. Am I dead? Again? We don't want to register this shit. It's still
[911.91s -> 935.70s]  following me. It's still trying to kill me. What the fuck is going on, man? Am I going to be all
[935.70s -> 956.68s]  right? Nerd. Nerd. Nerd on a wire? Okay. Now what? Cross to safety. Press and hold X button to move
[956.68s -> 961.40s]  towards the green zone. If you lose balance, recover with directional buttons. Pull will snap
[961.40s -> 981.38s]  when the time is up. What? I'm already gone. Oh, I get it. Okay. 40 milliseconds? 50 milliseconds?
[981.38s -> 995.78s]  What's this milliseconds? What? Get in the middle. All right. I'm good. Oh, God damn it. I try. You
[995.78s -> 1002.70s]  have to hold... Oh, fuck. It's going to happen again. Okay. Fine. I'm fine. It's the Tony Hawk
[1002.70s -> 1012.31s]  manual. Except sideways. We're good. I feel like I'm letting that go when it's supposed to.
[1014.92s -> 1028.41s]  Don't get over it. This thing's going to snap, isn't it? Now what? What the fuck? He's trying...
[1028.41s -> 1033.45s]  He's holding. He's trying to hold it. Come on. Hold it for like another one more time.
[1035.93s -> 1050.84s]  That's a lot harder than it looks. Trust me. Trust me. I'm really good at Tiger Woods golf.
[1051.64s -> 1066.18s]  Holy shit. Okay. That's harder than you think it is. Guys, I get a perfect drive in Tiger Woods
[1066.18s -> 1084.06s]  every time. Trust me. This is much harder than you think it is. Am I good? Hey, no. What? Is there
[1084.06s -> 1096.82s]  gust of wind? I'm fucking trying. I didn't get it once. No, I didn't because it's really weird.
[1098.39s -> 1104.20s]  It's either too much or too little. This game's running... It's like 20 FPS. I'm not getting all
[1104.20s -> 1125.56s]  the exact frames that I need. All right. We're good. Nope. Look at that mocap acting. All right.
[1125.56s -> 1144.12s]  That was pretty cool. All right. That was... Oh no. I got an A in bowling, an A in dancing,
[1144.12s -> 1160.55s]  and a C in an elevator, and a D on nerd on a wire. That's not good. Oh, this is a PlayStation 2
[1160.55s -> 1168.92s]  memory card. Right. My PS1... I don't know where it is. This game's like three hours long. Don't
[1168.92s -> 1178.23s]  worry. We're going to beat it. Story of Teneo Chapter 2. Five seconds to what?
[1191.16s -> 1207.32s]  I'll check it. Paramedics, the A team. Hold on. Just answer the questions. Press X for yes or
[1207.32s -> 1212.76s]  O for no. 10 correct answers are needed to clear the stage. Two wrong answers in a row will trigger
[1212.76s -> 1224.71s]  an electric shock. Hey, listen closely. Is 47,326 an even number? Yeah. What? Yes. What?

[1248.57s -> 1252.49s]  I'm pressing the right buttons. Wait. X is yes, right? X is yes?
[1253.62s -> 1260.10s]  Four play by six people per team. Yeah. Okay. I got it. I got it backwards. X is no. Oh my
[1260.10s -> 1265.38s]  fucking God. I thought X was yes. Okay. I got it wrong. X is, I thought X was yes. X is no.
[1268.66s -> 1281.37s]  No. Press X for yes. I had it right. What? X is yes. You got, you're freaking me out. I live in
[1281.37s -> 1286.89s]  America. I'm an American. When they start asking me about like 10,000 milliliters, I'm going to
[1286.89s -> 1295.74s]  get it wrong. Okay. Here we go. Is Maine the northernmost state in the U.S.? It's not. I
[1295.74s -> 1303.21s]  saw, I thought it was. Listen. What is it? Michigan? Is 21 an even number? No. He's American.
[1303.93s -> 1313.26s]  Is soccer played by 11 people per team? Yes. Are the reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh all female?
[1313.26s -> 1329.24s]  No. No. No. I'm okay. Is soccer played by 15 people per team? No. You just asked me,
[1329.24s -> 1333.56s]  that's the question. Is four hundred and three hundred times two? No. Um, I don't know.
[1334.60s -> 1339.40s]  There's two. I couldn't do it. Can you hear me? Is 30,000 equals five? I don't know. Yes.
[1340.28s -> 1347.18s]  I don't know. I can't read the fucking numbers. Is 218 times 2576? No. I don't know. I don't know.
[1347.18s -> 1357.70s]  I don't know. Is basketball a sport played by five people per team? Yes. Is one times one two? No.
[1358.50s -> 1368.63s]  Can you hear me? Is 68 times nine 610? I don't know. No. I can't do that. I seriously can't do
[1368.63s -> 1379.32s]  the writing in two seconds. What? How many hoes are there? Ten. I don't know. Point A is three to
[1379.32s -> 1386.04s]  be north of the tower. Point B is one to be north of the tower. Is point A five meters south of point
[1386.04s -> 1396.47s]  zero D? No. I'm dead. I'm still alive. Is one plus one, that's one two three four five six seven
[1396.47s -> 1410.50s]  eight nine ten eleven twelve. Shit. I thought, I thought they were going to throw something in
[1410.50s -> 1415.94s]  the end where it was like is one plus one plus one plus one plus two plus three minus ten ten.
[1415.94s -> 1428.97s]  You know what I mean? I thought they were going to do a minus on me. Is Maine? No. I already know
[1428.97s -> 1432.89s]  this because I've, guys, I've died three times. I can come back to life and get the same questions.
[1432.89s -> 1441.69s]  We rewind. Is the currency of Japan yen? Yes. Hey, you're still alive. Is California the western
[1441.69s -> 1445.45s]  most state in the U.S.? No, it's not. No, it's not. It's probably, I think it's Washington.
[1446.01s -> 1453.85s]  Or Alaska. Is basketball or sport played by five people? Yes. Or Hawaii. Hawaii. Hawaii is all the
[1453.85s -> 1467.10s]  way over there. Are the reindeer pulling this leg all female? No. By the way, yes. I don't know. Hey,

[1484.36s -> 1494.09s]  You hear me? I have no idea. I would need, I would need to write that down and do long division.
[1494.97s -> 1502.18s]  It's 300 north of power and point B, one of east. I don't fucking, I can't even read the question.
[1506.70s -> 1516.79s]  I gotta get these right. Point A is, is point, fuck. West of B and D is 200. Is the west tower,
[1516.79s -> 1531.48s]  is the tower? I can't read that fast. I can't even read. No, yes it is. No, it's not. I'm dead.
[1531.48s -> 1542.76s]  I'm gonna lose again. Point A is, it's point A, point A at point. I'm gonna suck her for a while.
[1542.76s -> 1551.10s]  What's it, what's it? One plus one plus one. Is that, no, what's, no, no, no, no, no. What, what is,
[1551.10s -> 1554.78s]  was that a two? I couldn't, it's a, it's like the blurry fucking line. I can't even read it.
[1555.50s -> 1570.52s]  Just do it again. Start over. I thought it was a plus. No, it's not. No, they're not. No,
[1571.48s -> 1575.72s]  they're not. Oh my god. Oh my god, I hate this one. They keep changing the questions.
[1576.36s -> 1580.20s]  I think I haven't memorized, but they haven't, fuck it, they changed it a little bit.
[1580.84s -> 1586.94s]  I think I haven't memorized. No, they're not all female. It just said are they all male. I thought
[1586.94s -> 1596.10s]  it was the same question and that's why I didn't read the other. Yes, it's yen. Is the currency of
[1596.10s -> 1623.67s]  Japan? No. Yes. Hey, can you hear me? No. Three, no, no. It's 100 minutes past 11,
[1623.67s -> 1631.50s]  15, 12, 15. What? What do you mean, what are you talking about? 100, no, it's not. Is the tower,
[1631.50s -> 1644.38s]  Haidotokyo tower 330, what, how am I supposed to know how tall the tower is? What is that?
[1645.34s -> 1651.35s]  How many sets is it? Oh, it's incentive. I don't know. There could be a small miniature tower in
[1651.35s -> 1657.43s]  Tokyo. That could be like a small welcome to like the miniature tiny Tokyo tower. I don't know
[1657.43s -> 1664.18s]  what's going on. I've never been there. Oh shit. Oh shit. I got to do that again. I can do the
[1664.18s -> 1670.54s]  whole thing again. All right, hold on. I can blow, I can do this one very easily, but I need to get
[1670.54s -> 1696.20s]  that memory card right now. Oh shit. Shit. Why is he being here? He's Yorika. This game, no.
[1697.32s -> 1705.75s]  Tokyo tower is? How do I know it could be? It's under a lot of stress. They can electrocute me.
[1710.52s -> 1716.12s]  Just when they think, I think I got the answer. All right, let me check this. Make sure it's
[1716.12s -> 1720.12s]  actually going to read this. Me and my friend beat this with no memory cards.
[1722.54s -> 1740.22s]  I don't care. I'm going to use one. What the fuck, dude? Easy. Oh, we had big bits come in.
[1742.58s -> 1748.58s]  I know how these ones work now though. Don't you'll see. You'll see. I'm interested though.
[1748.58s -> 1765.18s]  Now you got me interested. A phylactery lich gave $55, 5550 bits. Hey, Jerma, I bought the ring.
[1765.74s -> 1770.22s]  I'm going to use to propose to my girlfriend today and it's in part thanks to you. Thanks for
[1770.22s -> 1774.46s]  always putting on a good show and keeping us laughing. You're our special boy. Another marriage.
[1775.34s -> 1790.04s]  Another marriage proposal. That's two in a row. Oh, congratulations on the proposal, right? Hope
[1790.04s -> 1796.17s]  it goes well for you. Hope you guys are happy. And I'm not going to say anything to potentially
[1796.17s -> 1806.34s]  ruin it because that's what happened yesterday. Thanks for the huge amount of money. I'm happy to
[1806.34s -> 1810.66s]  be your special boy. Well, no, no, that's weird. That's kind of weird to say out loud.
[1811.46s -> 1814.74s]  All right, here we go. Dance fever. I'm going to get, I'm going to get A's on all this.
[1822.84s -> 1830.17s]  Let's do some exercising. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. Fuck. Oh, did they change the song too?
[1830.17s -> 1859.29s]  Or is it the same? Good job. Can you please ask my wife to marry me? Well, I do like that you can't
[1859.29s -> 1866.34s]  pause these. It makes it more interesting. I'm Han Solo.
[1872.79s -> 1904.04s]  Impressing those at the right time. The dude on the right looks like Jerma.
[1904.76s -> 1924.65s]  Pretty cool suit. No, I don't. I need to get a new suit. What color? What should I get for a suit?
[1924.65s -> 1938.98s]  What color should I get? Should I get like a pink suit? No, no, no, no. Yellow? Wait, what's
[1938.98s -> 1945.88s]  someone in Dumb and Dumber? Pinstripe? I don't know. I don't know if I would. Pinstripe would
[1945.88s -> 1963.34s]  work here. I would, I would, a light. No, you just, I have people saying that because of the
[1963.34s -> 1981.37s]  Joker. I get it. Um, I'd like light purple maybe. Red or green? Just trying to get to grandma's.
[1981.37s -> 2004.50s]  That's all I care about. Turn the brightness down. You think so? Too bright? Is it too bright?
[2005.14s -> 2023.51s]  Maybe a little? Well, we'll take a look. We'll see. What do you think about this? Better? Look a
[2023.51s -> 2042.65s]  little better? Oh, this part. This part kind of sucks. Here we go. Take it nice and easy. I know
[2042.65s -> 2070.73s]  how to play it. Fucking TV. Look out. Turn off the pixels. Uh, I can't do that because this is a
[2070.73s -> 2093.18s]  video game that was developed in 2002 or something. Cover that TV. All right. That was much cleaner
[2093.18s -> 2107.21s]  than last time. I'm much happier with the outcome on this one. Do it. Come on. Do the line.
[2109.19s -> 2123.24s]  Get me back in that ambulance. Get these questions right. Oh no, I forgot. I have to do nerd on a
[2123.24s -> 2133.85s]  wire. Shit. All right. Let me try to get this at least once. I can't get a D on every single one
[2133.85s -> 2143.32s]  of these. Here we go. Dude, I'm telling you, this is fucking hard. It's, it's very, it's got to be
[2143.32s -> 2160.95s]  that. It's hard. Get in there. Finally. All right. Got it. It went faster that time. It
[2160.95s -> 2184.79s]  fucks with you. Shit. Come on. All right. It's going to be faster. Yep. It's faster again.
[2191.56s -> 2206.97s]  Come on. Hit. Oh, good recovery. Immediate recovery. Oh my God. That's hard. I can't imagine
[2207.05s -> 2224.54s]  getting that every time. Whoa. Oh my God. You can do it. I know you can. I know you're capable
[2224.54s -> 2231.35s]  of it. There you are. Here we go. Okay. Would it be easier just to, yeah, these are just wrap
[2231.35s -> 2238.82s]  around the thing and shimmy up. All right. It's time to save the game and let's get back in that
[2238.82s -> 2247.18s]  ambulance. In Alaska, the Western most state. What is the Western most state then? Why for
[2247.66s -> 2253.22s]  a lot? Is it how it's Alaska? No. So what is it? Why? How far over is Hawaii?
[2263.43s -> 2281.77s]  Like data data one. All right. Here we go. Five seconds. I'm going to get this. I will do this.
[2281.77s -> 2293.35s]  That doesn't matter. It takes me three hours. Why is also East? That's what I mean. They,
[2293.35s -> 2297.75s]  that muck ass, you know, it could be it's East and West. It's the East most and West most state
[2297.75s -> 2314.71s]  potentially. Right. It's one kilometer, 10,000 liters. No, it's not liters. I couldn't even
[2314.71s -> 2323.22s]  get it's hard to read. It's California. The Western most state. No, it's one centimeter,
[2323.22s -> 2334.09s]  10 millimeters. It's not no 10 centimeters is one. No, an odd number. Did it say liters again?
[2334.09s -> 2339.53s]  I get hard to read. I thought of millimeters. Yes. It said milliliters.
[2340.33s -> 2356.31s]  Is soccer played by 15 people? No, it's 11. It's 8, 57 times 9, 7. No. Yes.
[2356.87s -> 2364.79s]  We got a wink. I know. Hold on. I don't, I have no idea. How the fuck am I supposed to know?
[2365.59s -> 2378.28s]  Hold on. That's a lot of subs. That's a lot of subs. Harrow is heavier than Hanoka.
[2378.28s -> 2382.28s]  Pierre is heavier than Harrow. Hanoka is, is Pierre heavier than? Yes.
[2382.28s -> 2390.76s]  Yes. Uh, Freddie Dredd. Freddie. Freddie. Hold on. No, Freddie. Freddie, did you go to,
[2391.40s -> 2398.28s]  did you go to Hash House or Go-Go? It's 93, 60 times 21. Not. Yes. I'm alive. I'm alive.
[2398.28s -> 2405.94s]  A hundred community subs from Freddie Dredd. Did you go to Hash House or Go-Go? And was it
[2405.94s -> 2409.83s]  your favorite restaurant you've ever been to in your whole life? Thanks for the fucking
[2410.63s -> 2426.76s]  100 community subs, Freddie. That's ridiculous. Insane. I, I, I need confirmation of that because
[2426.76s -> 2433.29s]  you said you were going. Well, we didn't get the verdict. Ride the stretcher. Use left and
[2433.29s -> 2437.93s]  right directional buttons to steer. Avoid cars and motorbikes. If you hit construction signs,
[2437.93s -> 2441.61s]  you'll lose control. For a while you're done when the distance meter reaches zero.
[2442.49s -> 2448.66s]  All right. Don't hit any cars.
[2448.66s -> 2471.48s]  All right. Why does his voice get lower? Can I jump? Is there a jump? Jesus. Why are they on
[2471.48s -> 2490.44s]  this? I have a long way to go. Come on. Stay good. Stay good. Oh my God. How many times
[2490.44s -> 2504.57s]  am I going to get a hit? I can't. All right. Settle down. Settle down.
[2504.57s -> 2518.28s]  I'm not, I'm not doing this. I hit one and it fucked up forever. I'm not pressing these buttons.
[2518.28s -> 2554.28s]  Now I can press. Dude, how have I not failed? I can't. I just read the funniest comment.
[2555.16s -> 2559.24s]  I just read it. And it's going to stick with me for like two weeks.
[2560.20s -> 2566.36s]  Somebody said, why? What's with the America's funniest home video music?
[2578.26s -> 2588.52s]  Or any show on Animal Planet? Oh, God damn it. That was fucking funny. Oh,
[2597.98s -> 2607.48s]  look at me. Oh, Freddy. Freddy says something again. I went twice. I got the blue cheese burger
[2607.48s -> 2612.04s]  the first time. It was great. And then the chicken and waffles the next time. My girlfriend loved it
[2612.04s -> 2616.36s]  as well. Thank you for that wonderful suggestion. I didn't get to see Betty White's slot machine
[2616.36s -> 2622.55s]  though. Unfortunate. Unfortunate, but that place is awesome. I'm glad they took care of you.
[2626.81s -> 2639.64s]  Wait, what? Don't I have a wife? Wait, am I going to like, Taneo? That's not, Taneo, what the fuck
[2639.64s -> 2651.13s]  are you doing, man? What? Did we just go? Love fireworks and Ferris wheel. He just waved at the
[2651.13s -> 2659.34s]  stream. Hold on. Find the pressure points. The lady wants a back massage. She will guide you.
[2660.06s -> 2667.06s]  Find the points with X. Press X repeatedly to fill up the massage meter.
[2674.06s -> 2683.11s]  Okay, I don't. What? What does that mean? I don't know what that means.
[2683.11s -> 2706.14s]  Oh, God damn it. Fuck. Okay. I get to put on like fucking animal planet music again.
[2711.58s -> 2722.23s]  Okay. All right. All right. All right. So that's not what you think it is. That's like a remix of
[2722.63s -> 2754.33s]  a famous song. I just don't want it to tone. Hold on. I don't want to turn it off. Just wait,
[2754.33s -> 2757.61s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll do it with all the audio. You don't need to hear this.
[2757.61s -> 2790.50s]  I'll pass you bedtime anyways, you kids. Okay. What? Okay. I'm going to get Twitch arrested if
[2790.50s -> 2810.70s]  I keep doing this. Okay. Hold on. I don't. Okay. Oh, God damn it. All right. I'm going to get
[2810.70s -> 2819.69s]  through this. Let's get through this. I'll get through this. Yeah, I got to get some fucking
[2819.69s -> 2830.02s]  background music to make sure like people, whatever.
[2843.50s -> 2844.78s]  You don't need to hear anything.
[2857.88s -> 2881.13s]  This is uncomfortable. This is uncomfortable. Is the song still going? I can't even hear it.
[2882.01s -> 2923.83s]  I can't. Is it still going? I have no audio. I have to do it. Dun dun dun. Okay. I'm glad this
[2923.83s -> 2927.67s]  is muted because this is a lot of, this is a lot of fucked up stuff going on right now.
[2936.98s -> 2939.78s]  The other one. This is the new one.
[2945.88s -> 2964.81s]  I didn't play the new one. Make it stop. I'm trying.
[2967.75s -> 2973.35s]  All right. Let's go. Anybody in the chat, over the age of 18, stay.
[2975.99s -> 2978.47s]  She's happy that there's a back massage going on.
[2978.47s -> 3008.60s]  This is not the way I'm going out. This is not the way I'm going out on
[3008.60s -> 3017.77s]  Twitch. This is not the way I'm going out on Twitch. This ain't the way I'm going out on Twitch.
[3018.49s -> 3044.58s]  No. Not going to happen. Let's get to that.
[3044.58s -> 3047.58s]  This is a strange of things.
[3056.36s -> 3057.36s]  This is too hard.
[3057.36s -> 3060.30s]  I'm gonna fucking pee my pants.
[3064.94s -> 3068.67s]  Alright, come on.
[3068.67s -> 3076.71s]  Oh my god, man, this is so hard.
[3084.48s -> 3085.48s]  Do you understand how hard this is?
[3085.48s -> 3087.48s]  Look, this is fucking impossible.
[3088.48s -> 3089.48s]  This is impossible.
[3095.88s -> 3096.88s]  Alright, no, no, no, no.
[3099.62s -> 3101.62s]  Fucking god, I can't un-
[3113.34s -> 3115.10s]  What is this?
[3115.10s -> 3116.10s]  Stranger Things-
[3116.10s -> 3118.10s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
[3118.10s -> 3119.10s]  Is this like fucking spoilers?
[3119.10s -> 3133.11s]  I just saw season three fucking tease, and I just had to-
[3133.11s -> 3134.11s]  I can't hear what's happening.
[3134.11s -> 3136.11s]  I don't have audio for my desktop.
[3136.11s -> 3139.11s]  I saw season three tease, and I'm like, oh fuck, is it like-
[3139.11s -> 3141.11s]  Are they talking about the season three?
[3141.11s -> 3143.63s]  God almighty.
[3143.63s -> 3147.98s]  No, I don't want any more Stranger Things.
[3147.98s -> 3151.98s]  The boys of Stranger Things on fucking like Conan O'Brien.
[3153.22s -> 3154.22s]  Get this off.
[3154.22s -> 3172.21s]  Come on, I have to get this.
[3172.21s -> 3183.37s]  Why?
[3183.37s -> 3187.27s]  Why is it on this?
[3187.27s -> 3195.42s]  I just went- I went and hit the back button like six times.
[3195.42s -> 3198.42s]  Why is it on Stranger Things announcements?
[3198.42s -> 3223.58s]  I'm paying attention to the game, and I look over at chat, and I see-
[3223.58s -> 3226.58s]  Fucking change it, dude, change it.
[3226.58s -> 3229.68s]  I'm gonna lose my mind.
[3229.68s -> 3243.38s]  I got it, this is gonna be it.
[3243.38s -> 3251.95s]  Oh my fucking god.
[3251.95s -> 3273.14s]  Oh my god, man.
[3273.14s -> 3283.34s]  Okay, I got it, this is gonna be it.
[3283.34s -> 3287.84s]  Done.
[3287.84s -> 3288.84s]  Okay, we'll be back.
[3288.84s -> 3294.11s]  Alright.
[3294.11s -> 3295.11s]  Jesus Christ.
[3295.11s -> 3297.57s]  I can't believe my fucking legs.
[3297.57s -> 3298.57s]  Did I?
[3298.57s -> 3299.57s]  Alright, be real with me.
[3299.57s -> 3302.81s]  Did I like spoil fucking strange things like all three seasons?
[3302.81s -> 3303.81s]  Did I?
[3303.81s -> 3304.81s]  Like, I hope I didn't.
[3304.81s -> 3305.81s]  Did that actually happen?
[3305.81s -> 3309.54s]  No?
[3309.54s -> 3310.54s]  No, did I?
[3310.54s -> 3312.68s]  Yes?
[3312.68s -> 3314.11s]  No?
[3314.11s -> 3315.11s]  No, did I?
[3315.11s -> 3316.11s]  No, seriously?
[3316.11s -> 3317.11s]  Don't fucking tell me that.
[3317.11s -> 3326.32s]  How do we get from America's Funniest Home Videos theme to Stranger Things announcements
[3326.32s -> 3329.86s]  to-
[3329.86s -> 3330.86s]  You played music.
[3330.86s -> 3336.71s]  Oh.
[3336.71s -> 3337.71s]  Why did she leave a bomb with me?
[3337.71s -> 3347.44s]  I only got a C.
[3347.44s -> 3350.83s]  God damn it.
[3352.33s -> 3357.94s]  Dirty old man.
[3357.94s -> 3364.62s]  For that one to be under review.
[3364.62s -> 3367.62s]  We had $50 come in.
[3367.62s -> 3372.89s]  Twice.
[3372.89s -> 3376.89s]  One from Vimthral and one from DesoidCatchfuck.
[3376.89s -> 3380.75s]  You got an A.
[3380.75s -> 3383.31s]  Do you permit override?
[3383.31s -> 3384.49s]  Yes.
[3384.49s -> 3386.49s]  Vimthral, thanks for the 5000 bits.
[3386.49s -> 3388.49s]  Fat bits for a very funny man.
[3388.49s -> 3391.49s]  Please read this as it's important and this person needs to hear it.
[3391.49s -> 3395.22s]  Okay.
[3395.22s -> 3397.22s]  If you're out there.
[3398.22s -> 3401.46s]  Ignis Scientia.
[3401.46s -> 3405.46s]  Please let me put your beautiful aqua line nose in my mouth.
[3405.46s -> 3406.46s]  What is that?
[3406.46s -> 3408.92s]  What is that?
[3408.92s -> 3413.40s]  What did I just do?
[3413.40s -> 3417.40s]  Also, chat, you better be making the away noises each time Teniro makes them in the
[3417.40s -> 3421.52s]  game.
[3421.52s -> 3422.52s]  Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[3422.52s -> 3425.21s]  It's a Final Fantasy character.
[3425.21s -> 3429.16s]  Now what the fuck is going on?
[3429.16s -> 3435.37s]  What is going on in this game?
[3435.37s -> 3437.61s]  Thank you, Vimthral.
[3437.61s -> 3439.91s]  Independence Debate?
[3439.91s -> 3444.46s]  Independence 3A?
[3444.46s -> 3445.46s]  Hello?
[3445.46s -> 3446.46s]  Oh, Rurika.
[3446.46s -> 3447.46s]  It's me, Dad.
[3447.46s -> 3448.46s]  Don't let them attack.
[3448.46s -> 3449.46s]  That's the...
[3449.46s -> 3450.46s]  What are you all talking about?
[3450.46s -> 3451.46s]  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[3451.46s -> 3453.82s]  That's the what?
[3453.82s -> 3454.82s]  That's terrible.
[3454.82s -> 3460.93s]  Okay.
[3460.93s -> 3464.88s]  Protect the UFO.
[3464.88s -> 3467.88s]  But first, I want to say thank you to, uh, Desoid.
[3467.88s -> 3469.88s]  Another $5000.
[3469.88s -> 3471.88s]  It's 5000 bits.
[3471.88s -> 3474.12s]  5000 bit currency dollars.
[3474.12s -> 3476.12s]  Uh, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[3476.12s -> 3480.68s]  It's my birthday today and I had to go to three important meetings.
[3480.68s -> 3482.68s]  It's the hardest I've laughed today.
[3482.68s -> 3486.01s]  Thanks for making today a little less stressful.
[3486.01s -> 3487.01s]  Yeah.
[3487.01s -> 3488.01s]  Absolutely.
[3488.01s -> 3489.01s]  Thank you.
[3489.01s -> 3490.01s]  Thanks for the 5000 bits.
[3490.01s -> 3491.18s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[3491.18s -> 3493.38s]  Hope your meetings went well.
[3493.38s -> 3495.38s]  Alright, so shoot down the missiles attacking the UFO.
[3495.38s -> 3498.94s]  Directional buttons to aim and X to shoot.
[3504.49s -> 3506.49s]  Why are we siding with the aliens?
[3506.49s -> 3509.58s]  Again?
[3509.58s -> 3511.02s]  Why, why does it...
[3511.02s -> 3520.94s]  Did I shoot the planes?
[3520.94s -> 3534.91s]  Someone's there.
[3534.91s -> 3544.70s]  Oh, it's coming right at me.
[3544.70s -> 3545.70s]  Oh!
[3545.70s -> 3546.70s]  Even in...
[3546.70s -> 3556.86s]  Oh, this is kind of hard.
[3556.86s -> 3567.32s]  Okay.
[3567.32s -> 3568.32s]  He just...
[3568.32s -> 3569.32s]  Come on.
[3569.32s -> 3575.87s]  I did it, right?
[3575.87s -> 3589.21s]  150.
[3589.21s -> 3590.21s]  15.
[3590.21s -> 3591.21s]  Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
[3591.21s -> 3593.73s]  Good.
[3593.73s -> 3594.73s]  That's not a UFO.
[3594.73s -> 3596.48s]  That's a Simon Says.
[3596.48s -> 3606.85s]  It does kind of look like that.
[3610.82s -> 3611.82s]  Titanic away.
[3611.82s -> 3618.10s]  Not every day you see a middle-aged man falling out of the sky.
[3618.10s -> 3621.24s]  Thank you so much.
[3621.24s -> 3622.24s]  That's okay.
[3622.24s -> 3624.89s]  No big deal.
[3626.83s -> 3630.12s]  Um...
[3630.12s -> 3631.12s]  Oh!
[3631.12s -> 3632.12s]  Why did you...
[3632.12s -> 3633.12s]  What have you done?
[3633.12s -> 3635.94s]  Bail water out of the boat.
[3635.94s -> 3639.94s]  Press X button repeatedly to scoop up water with a bucket-press triangle to empty it.
[3639.94s -> 3642.94s]  Avoid falling objects with an umbrella.
[3642.94s -> 3644.94s]  The directional buttons.
[3644.94s -> 3646.94s]  Reach the goal before it sinks.
[3660.32s -> 3661.32s]  Do I have to help him?
[3661.32s -> 3663.52s]  Wait, he...
[3663.52s -> 3666.21s]  Oh, he's gone.
[3666.21s -> 3667.21s]  Sorry, Captain.
[3667.21s -> 3673.50s]  I hope I don't lose points for that.
[3673.50s -> 3674.50s]  What?
[3674.50s -> 3684.79s]  How did I not get points for that?
[3684.79s -> 3685.79s]  Come on, help.
[3685.79s -> 3688.63s]  Faster and faster and faster.
[3688.63s -> 3689.63s]  Oh, here it comes, right?
[3689.63s -> 3690.63s]  I tried to press it.
[3690.63s -> 3691.87s]  I tried to press it.
[3691.87s -> 3692.87s]  It didn't do anything.
[3692.87s -> 3696.35s]  Uh-oh.
[3696.35s -> 3701.30s]  We're not moving.
[3701.30s -> 3702.30s]  We're not moving.
[3702.30s -> 3703.30s]  We're not moving.

[3790.66s -> 3796.38s]  You don't?
[3796.38s -> 3798.75s]  Wait, I'm just supposed to get hit by it?
[3798.75s -> 3813.98s]  I don't think I can dodge it.
[3813.98s -> 3815.98s]  I'm sure I can.

[3938.50s -> 3940.86s]  What's wrong with this lady?
[3940.86s -> 3943.17s]  What the hell was that?
[3943.17s -> 3945.41s]  Did we just get like a Hideo Kojima?
[3945.41s -> 3947.41s]  What was that?
[3947.41s -> 3950.58s]  That was like a please unplug your things turning off, right?
[3950.58s -> 3960.12s]  Okay, you just killed a dog.
[3960.12s -> 3961.36s]  No, you didn't, thank God.

[3971.14s -> 3972.14s]  I did it.
[3972.14s -> 3973.45s]  Great Canadian says,
[3973.45s -> 3974.45s]  Great Canadian says,
[3974.45s -> 3975.45s]  Is this like one of those flash games
[3975.45s -> 3977.45s]  where you need to shake your mouse back and forth
[3977.45s -> 3979.45s]  to make the story advance?
[3979.45s -> 3984.72s]  That was an A.
[3984.72s -> 3987.47s]  I got an A+.
[3987.47s -> 3990.54s]  I did it right during the...
[3990.54s -> 3996.11s]  I'm never gonna be able to hear this song ever again
[3996.11s -> 3997.11s]  and think.
[3997.11s -> 3999.42s]  It's always gonna bring back memories.
[3999.42s -> 4010.62s]  B and A equals an A+.
[4010.62s -> 4012.62s]  Yeah, but I got extra credit.

[4035.42s -> 4043.41s]  Afternoon of the Wolves.
[4043.41s -> 4044.41s]  Wolf robbery?
[4044.41s -> 4048.44s]  Oh dear.
[4048.44s -> 4049.44s]  Get to the exit.
[4049.44s -> 4051.44s]  Press X repeatedly to move forward.
[4051.44s -> 4053.44s]  If the robbers are around,
[4053.44s -> 4055.44s]  step back with Triangle.
[4055.44s -> 4057.44s]  This is Five Nights at Freddy's.
[4057.44s -> 4060.06s]  Step back with Triangle.
[4060.06s -> 4062.06s]  Use the security cameras to detect their location.
[4062.06s -> 4065.06s]  Be alert when the robber indicator turns yellow.
[4065.06s -> 4073.13s]  So where am I?
[4073.13s -> 4074.69s]  Oh, it's coming.
[4074.69s -> 4075.69s]  Okay.
[4075.69s -> 4080.45s]  Hurry, hurry.

[4082.45s -> 4083.82s]  Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
[4083.82s -> 4089.84s]  Hide.
[4089.84s -> 4090.84s]  Okay.
[4090.84s -> 4094.32s]  Um.
[4094.32s -> 4096.01s]  No, no, no.
[4096.01s -> 4097.01s]  Stay, stay, stay.
[4097.01s -> 4098.01s]  So he goes left,
[4098.01s -> 4099.01s]  and then he,
[4099.01s -> 4100.01s]  was he turned left again?
[4100.01s -> 4101.01s]  It's probably gonna walk down this way.
[4101.01s -> 4102.01s]  All right.
[4102.01s -> 4103.57s]  I'm gonna wait till he goes,
[4103.57s -> 4104.57s]  walks this way.
[4104.57s -> 4105.57s]  Is this,
[4105.57s -> 4115.00s]  that guy's permanently looking this way though,
[4115.00s -> 4116.00s]  isn't he?
[4116.00s -> 4121.21s]  Okay, I'm right there.
[4121.21s -> 4122.21s]  Why'd the guy,
[4122.21s -> 4123.64s]  okay, hold on.
[4123.64s -> 4130.00s]  Go.
[4130.00s -> 4137.70s]  Who saw me?
[4137.70s -> 4138.70s]  Top left.
[4138.70s -> 4139.70s]  Oh, shit.
[4139.70s -> 4140.70s]  Okay.
[4140.70s -> 4145.46s]  I'm the next best.
[4145.46s -> 4153.57s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[4153.57s -> 4155.00s]  Hurry up.
[4155.00s -> 4156.00s]  Hurry the fuck up.
[4156.00s -> 4158.18s]  He's so slow.
[4158.18s -> 4164.09s]  Okay.
[4164.09s -> 4180.75s]  He's gonna see me every time.
[4180.75s -> 4187.56s]  Go.
[4187.56s -> 4188.56s]  What?
[4188.56s -> 4189.56s]  I'm trying to hide in the other bush.
[4189.56s -> 4203.09s]  Get in there.
[4203.09s -> 4204.09s]  What?
[4204.09s -> 4206.29s]  Okay, I made it.
[4206.29s -> 4209.91s]  So now I gotta go across to the couch.
[4209.91s -> 4215.80s]  So I'm not safe here.
[4215.80s -> 4218.80s]  I'll be safe when he comes this way.
[4218.80s -> 4221.42s]  So here we go.
[4221.42s -> 4225.67s]  Bang.
[4225.67s -> 4226.67s]  Safe.
[4226.67s -> 4227.67s]  Here we are.
[4227.67s -> 4229.30s]  Now we got a scenario.
[4229.30s -> 4231.30s]  We got red, top left.
[4231.30s -> 4233.30s]  Goes back and forth,
[4233.30s -> 4236.37s]  and then he goes that way.
[4236.37s -> 4238.37s]  Red comes back down.
[4238.37s -> 4239.37s]  When he turns this way,
[4239.37s -> 4242.57s]  it's time to go now.
[4242.57s -> 4245.73s]  What?
[4245.73s -> 4246.73s]  No, I was,
[4246.73s -> 4247.73s]  I thought it was gonna turn green.
[4247.73s -> 4249.03s]  Fuck.
[4249.03s -> 4250.03s]  I thought the one on the left was gonna turn green.
[4250.03s -> 4251.03s]  I thought,
[4251.03s -> 4252.03s]  cause he was green,
[4252.03s -> 4253.03s]  I thought they was gonna turn green
[4253.03s -> 4267.78s]  right when I stood up.
[4267.78s -> 4275.35s]  I'm gonna get caught.
[4275.35s -> 4290.37s]  Ma, just break a window and dive.
[4290.37s -> 4291.37s]  No, do it again.
[4291.37s -> 4302.46s]  Do it again.
[4302.46s -> 4303.46s]  Do it again.
[4303.46s -> 4306.05s]  Get there.
[4306.05s -> 4314.07s]  Am I there?
[4314.07s -> 4317.36s]  All right, here we go.
[4317.36s -> 4320.36s]  Two, three, and go.
[4320.36s -> 4328.18s]  Okay.
[4328.18s -> 4329.18s]  Now.
[4329.18s -> 4332.14s]  I got,
[4332.14s -> 4333.14s]  I'm right there.
[4333.14s -> 4335.14s]  He's now red.
[4335.14s -> 4337.14s]  He's yellow up there.
[4337.14s -> 4338.14s]  He's green.
[4338.14s -> 4339.14s]  He's still yellow.
[4339.14s -> 4340.14s]  Now he's red coming down.
[4340.14s -> 4341.14s]  Now I can go.
[4341.14s -> 4342.14s]  Not yet.
[4342.14s -> 4343.14s]  No.
[4343.14s -> 4346.34s]  What's the scenario where they're all green?
[4346.34s -> 4347.34s]  Right there?
[4347.34s -> 4349.61s]  Right there.
[4349.61s -> 4350.61s]  One, two.
[4350.61s -> 4351.61s]  All right.
[4351.61s -> 4352.61s]  It's when,
[4352.61s -> 4353.61s]  holy shit.
[4353.61s -> 4355.87s]  Okay.
[4355.87s -> 4356.87s]  It's when he walks down.
[4356.87s -> 4357.87s]  When he comes down,
[4357.87s -> 4360.11s]  I get an opportunity right now.
[4360.11s -> 4362.12s]  No.
[4362.12s -> 4363.12s]  It's gonna be,
[4363.12s -> 4364.12s]  I should know that.
[4364.12s -> 4367.09s]  I would have been caught.
[4367.09s -> 4370.52s]  One, two, three, and comes again.
[4370.52s -> 4371.52s]  Here he comes.
[4371.52s -> 4372.52s]  Here we go.
[4372.52s -> 4374.52s]  This is the part where we go.
[4374.52s -> 4378.30s]  And here it comes.
[4378.30s -> 4385.68s]  I'm spamming it.
[4385.68s -> 4386.68s]  Settle down.
[4386.68s -> 4387.68s]  Jesus, Cherubi.

[4428.41s -> 4434.06s]  pound for pound.
[4434.06s -> 4435.06s]  Balance the weights.
[4435.06s -> 4438.06s]  Move items from shopping basket into plastic bag
[4438.06s -> 4441.06s]  so weight of bag and pig become equal.
[4441.06s -> 4445.06s]  Use L1 and R1 to switch between basket and bag.
[4445.06s -> 4447.06s]  Use the X button to select items
[4447.06s -> 4450.06s]  and the square button to compare weights.
[4450.06s -> 4452.06s]  You can select up to six items.
[4452.06s -> 4455.58s]  Okay.

[6605.20s -> 6609.73s]  spider-man that would be amazing to move forward press and hold the X button
[6609.73s -> 6613.77s]  until the meter reaches the green zone be aware of the meter disappearing at a
[6613.77s -> 6618.09s]  set point if you lose balance recover with directional buttons the game's
[6618.09s -> 6632.99s]  over if the spider gets you hold and let go oh I get it it disappears okay I feel
[6632.99s -> 6641.60s]  like this is gonna turn into a real pain in the ass don't say it resist I'm not

[6847.02s -> 6857.25s]  I'm just gonna do it lightly I would be I was fine you guys don't know pickleball
[6857.25s -> 6869.18s]  the greatest sport ever invented but you guys didn't have pickleball everyone
[6869.18s -> 6873.72s]  should know pickleball yeah I agree I'm shocked at this that's like one of the
[6873.72s -> 6879.58s]  most fun it's like tennis and ping-pong mixed together into one sport yeah I
[6879.58s -> 6883.56s]  just made a bunch of new pickleball fans some of you guys right now what the

[6923.56s -> 6927.16s]  harder okay it's the same one that dad did except it's way harder of course they
[6927.16s -> 6936.95s]  get like this job to the kids I'll be honest though this is like an old man
[6936.95s -> 6943.53s]  would you rather have an old man or like an eight-year-old do this that's tricky
[6943.53s -> 6956.23s]  I don't know the old man or think what if the old man goes down and it goes like
[6956.67s -> 6969.89s]  and then he can't go any he's done but he throws his back up but he didn't
[6969.89s -> 6979.69s]  though yeah I guess that's true if if he's not getting hurt by getting thrown
[6979.69s -> 6993.85s]  out of the boat a thousand times we gotta move now we gotta move now come on
[6994.45s -> 7040.38s]  this boat's going great you motherfucker I kind of like just double tapped come on get this
