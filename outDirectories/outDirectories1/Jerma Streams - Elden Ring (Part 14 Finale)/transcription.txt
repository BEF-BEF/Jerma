[4.09s -> 17.77s]  Hey, what's up? How are you a little early? It's okay. I it's a little early. Yeah,
[17.77s -> 22.89s]  it's supposed to start tomorrow at like four. We're a little early. I figured I'd start like
[22.89s -> 29.94s]  at least a couple hours early. Give me a minute. I don't know where my phone is.
[30.66s -> 77.40s]  Be right back. Send a tweet out real quick. And we can get started. What about have you seen our
[77.40s -> 85.61s]  place I have been very aware of the ongoing various battles going on in our place. Make
[85.61s -> 92.76s]  this really clear. The germamite army is incredibly incredibly strong. I'm observing
[93.40s -> 107.96s]  I'm observing and I'm calculating. I have no commands for you. We're observing. Let's see what
[107.96s -> 122.06s]  happens. Who gave this lunatic an army? I will be I'm telling you right now that I've got a
[122.78s -> 134.17s]  I've got a strong community. What are the orders? I don't have orders for you.
[135.75s -> 146.73s]  Your orders are to observe, calculate, passionate, empathize, strike when necessary.
[148.42s -> 162.17s]  There's those are your orders. Give us something. I am observing. I have nowhere to strike. And
[162.17s -> 167.21s]  that's the thing. That's the thing, right? Oh, German. Where are we? Where are we striking?
[168.68s -> 182.07s]  I don't have I there are no targets for me here. Where are we landing? You need to defend you need
[182.07s -> 193.35s]  to defend the sus face. Well, I'm aware of his existence. I'm aware. I'm very aware. Worst
[193.35s -> 200.31s]  general ever. General, what are your orders? Very aware. And I want you to be compassionate. And I
[200.31s -> 205.96s]  want you to be aware. Sir, they're flanking us. Just be aware of it. I want you to be aware of it.
[205.96s -> 210.52s]  And just keep your eye on it. What a bad general. But I don't have anything for you yet. Okay.
[211.24s -> 217.02s]  I am actually trying to see where the hell this plays out. I don't want to make an alliance with
[217.02s -> 222.78s]  somebody. And then here's the Okay, here's the thing about the our play stuff. So if I make an
[222.78s -> 229.02s]  alliance with somebody, that person has a battle or a war going on with somebody else that now hates
[229.02s -> 233.50s]  me that wants to get rid of my shit. And then I come forward and I go off. Let's go after that
[233.50s -> 237.90s]  fucking person. I break that alliance that I have with that person. That person that has two more
[237.90s -> 243.93s]  alliances. Then those people are mad at me. And then somebody from the top right corner
[244.89s -> 249.29s]  it starts posting and saying, Hey, germamites, we need you in top right corner to defend the
[249.29s -> 254.25s]  shovel knight. It's like, dude, I broke like five alliances. And I have like two wars going on down
[254.25s -> 261.88s]  here. I don't know. I don't it's hard to get involved. But if we need to, oh, we will if we
[261.88s -> 276.62s]  need to. We will. What is he talking about? Okay. I will show you in just a second. These are just
[276.62s -> 282.70s]  like the delusions of some random guy. No. Okay, listen to me. I didn't even tweet the stream. Just
[282.70s -> 345.86s]  hold on. Give me a sec. Okay, I'm back. So yeah, let me explain what this is. This is easy for me
[345.86s -> 356.63s]  to do this. I'll just show you. Come back over here. Hi, how are you? Okay, so this is our slash
[356.63s -> 366.76s]  place. I've been made aware of this. Every single pixel here, every single one is placed by an
[366.76s -> 372.54s]  individual user. So for instance, like, like pirates, right? Like somebody one person had to
[372.54s -> 381.24s]  click that square right there. It is huge. I believe it's every five to 10 minutes. It
[381.24s -> 389.90s]  your cooldown refreshes is a dick on the screen. Okay, whatever. What do you want me to do about?
[389.90s -> 395.02s]  Oh, no. Okay, refresh in five to 10 minutes and show me where the show me where the where's Waldo
[395.02s -> 400.47s]  dick is. Because that's just going to happen for the rest of the time. This is here. So the craziest
[400.47s -> 405.72s]  part about this is, oh, okay, we've got there's a little of this, this, I think that's supposed
[405.72s -> 411.82s]  to be me. I think I think that's me. I've been told it's me. I don't know. I'm like, kind of
[411.82s -> 417.90s]  don't want it to be what it is. I don't I have no stake in this. I have no idea how what happened.
[418.54s -> 425.40s]  I didn't tell anybody to do this. But that is, I guess, where you guys have collected yourselves,
[425.40s -> 435.30s]  I guess. But let me tell you, I there are no alliances here. And let if the germamites need
[435.30s -> 444.66s]  to be called in, maybe it depends. I am totally okay with this being right here. I don't I don't
[444.66s -> 449.99s]  we don't need to go anywhere else when I do do anything else. I'm just observing. Check the
[449.99s -> 475.72s]  chessboard. Where's the chessboard? chessboard? Right side. Jesus Christ. Okay, chessboard.
[486.38s -> 494.46s]  Left. Why did you say right? Everyone just started saying right. Chessboard. Down near this
[494.54s -> 507.74s]  sus face. Left in the middle. Okay, in relation to Star Wars, where is it? Directly above sus.
[510.78s -> 521.13s]  Oh, right here. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. This is cool. I'm okay with that, right? Can we can
[521.13s -> 527.21s]  just like concentrate in this little spot? I don't I don't need more than one cube. Okay.
[529.14s -> 541.24s]  Let me tell you, very cleanly, don't need much. We need a square this big. If you attack,
[543.77s -> 552.57s]  germamites are ready. And they always will be. And they're some of the strongest, most I said vile,
[553.53s -> 558.97s]  the most vile. They are very strong and they know and they know how to they know how to draw.
[558.97s -> 566.41s]  This community is incredibly artistic. Like you guys could get the amount of art the amount of
[566.41s -> 573.99s]  creativity that I see here. Trust me when I say I'm all we need is a little we need a little cube
[573.99s -> 583.29s]  and that's it. There are no allegiances. There are no alliances. Everybody is we have a creative
[583.29s -> 587.85s]  community here. So I what I'm not going to do is I'm not going to what I'm not going to say this
[587.85s -> 593.14s]  because I know what the second I say this it's going to be like, there it goes, right? Let's
[593.14s -> 599.64s]  observe. I'll look back in a little bit and see what it looks like. We're incredibly uncoordinated
[599.64s -> 614.70s]  but strong. Vile artists. No, you're a community of incredibly intelligent doctors, scientists,
[614.70s -> 620.78s]  and he's along and I got to cut them. Like with it. I just saw it over here. Okay, I got to
[620.78s -> 625.18s]  fucking turn this preview off. I distract myself with my own preview. I'm reading what you guys
[625.18s -> 628.06s]  are saying. Then I go there's a guy right there and I look at it. I fucking hate it. I don't want
[628.06s -> 637.29s]  to look at this. I'm going to move the face cam to the other side of the screen. Oh, yeah. Oh,
[637.29s -> 641.13s]  I know there are other streamers that are doing this. I've been watching some of them and it's
[641.13s -> 648.55s]  been fucking crazy. It's been actually pretty entertaining if I'm honest. Change your talismans.
[648.55s -> 654.57s]  Thank you. Now let's get to the real thing here. Well, I yes, I'm supposed to stream tomorrow,
[654.57s -> 662.42s]  but I kind of I just I wanted to do it and I said people were saying some stuff to me.
[662.50s -> 666.17s]  I'm going to take it to I'm going to take it to heart now. They said, German,
[666.17s -> 672.07s]  these last few encounters are ridiculous. They're hard. They're frustrating. They make people angry
[672.07s -> 677.18s]  and you need to do whatever means necessary to try to kill them. So I know that there are a few
[677.18s -> 683.32s]  spells that I don't have that people keep telling me about and I want to go get those spells and
[683.32s -> 689.67s]  just see what they do. Yeah, it's our slash place. It's really looking even if we're not going to
[689.67s -> 694.41s]  participate all that much. I mean, I know a lot of you guys already are. It's just really cool.
[694.41s -> 700.42s]  They do it every what every year every every few years. It's it's really cool. It's been awesome
[700.42s -> 707.34s]  to see just the communities kind of even across the world watching all these different communities,
[707.34s -> 714.62s]  like kind of if a fun way, right, kind of battle for this kind of land and like territory almost.
[714.62s -> 718.82s]  It's like, all right, like I've seen like people have treaties. All right, I'll get we'll give up
[719.38s -> 724.26s]  this the quarter of this part of our of our territory here, but we want an alliance.
[724.26s -> 733.05s]  It's like everyone's playing risk. It's a game of risk with like 60 million people.
[733.05s -> 744.14s]  You're a beta male chapstick user. No, I'm older and my lips are dry. Yeah, it's just they're
[744.14s -> 751.27s]  playing everyone's playing like risk or like Crusader Kings or something, right? You're
[751.27s -> 759.16s]  speaking with Elden Ring vocabulary. What is he talking about? It's just our whatever. You know
[759.16s -> 765.37s]  what I'm doing. So I'm at the end of the game. So this is literally the finale, but I'm not going
[765.37s -> 770.49s]  to go through this door. I want to go get the spell because everyone was talking about there's
[770.49s -> 774.90s]  a spell. There's two of them, three of them. I want the crazy spells and I want to do the crazy
[774.90s -> 782.25s]  shit. What opportunity am I going to have after this? So I know people go get the comet, comet,
[782.25s -> 789.64s]  comet, comet, comet, right? Where is it? Do I know where it is? Should you get the spell that turns
[789.64s -> 801.93s]  you into a toaster? That would be fucking Monka Lol. Go to the Volcano Manor. Okay, that's stop
[801.93s -> 819.21s]  number one. Volcano Manor. You should do a long rip. Go through the Windham Ruins in Atlas Plateau.
[823.19s -> 829.83s]  Dude, I didn't do like anything in this bottom part of Atlas Plateau. Do I have it? Or is it down
[829.83s -> 843.75s]  here somewhere? Where's this move? Right here? After Caleb, you just started zooming by the tree,
[844.76s -> 854.89s]  like up here, over here somewhere, maybe here. You're missing a lot of bonfires.
[856.25s -> 865.02s]  Like three in this whole entire zone. There's a dungeon along the wall, like here or here.
[865.02s -> 870.60s]  I don't think I even walked. I don't think I even went over here or the cringe village
[872.70s -> 879.83s]  at mine you highlighted earlier. So like over here, like in this area. So if I go over here,
[879.83s -> 889.91s]  am I gonna be like in the right spot? Is that correct? South of Volcano Manor. So like down
[889.91s -> 898.44s]  here. Should I go from abandoned coffin this way? I guess I could just look this up, right? Do I
[898.44s -> 910.44s]  really? I could just look it up. Well, we'll start here. I'm just gonna look it up. What's the spell
[910.44s -> 930.46s]  called? Comet Azur. Okay, Comet Azur. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Where to find it?
[931.51s -> 943.30s]  Uh, it's in the Hermit Village in Mount Gelmer. Okay, so where's that? It looks like... Yeah,
[943.30s -> 948.79s]  so it's right... This is actually probably not a bad place to be. It's actually literally right
[948.79s -> 960.52s]  below that, the tree there. I gotta go like to... How do I get over there? It's like here. So from,
[960.52s -> 972.23s]  probably from this grave here? It's like right here. Not even close. What are you talking? Yes,
[972.23s -> 979.86s]  it is. It's right there. I'm gonna go from... Should I just go from the... Should I walk this
[979.86s -> 986.84s]  way or should I walk down from here? It's the village on the map. Right here. All right,
[986.84s -> 995.34s]  I'm gonna try to find my way over there. Starting from... I have to go this way. I'm just gonna go
[995.34s -> 1018.49s]  from here. Need to see dance. Oh, that's all right then. Wait, wrong one. Go from the... This
[1018.49s -> 1028.10s]  actually... Because this is probably down. Can I get there from here? There's a discord for the
[1028.10s -> 1033.30s]  r slash place. Yeah, you guys can do whatever you want. I'm not sending you anywhere. All right,
[1033.30s -> 1048.66s]  I'm ready. But I ain't... I got nowhere for you to go. I've already played Genshin Impact. Um,
[1049.82s -> 1056.04s]  I played it a little bit when it first came out. Put like six or seven thousand dollars into it.
[1056.60s -> 1069.85s]  Then I was like, ah, I'm not really into it. And then I uninstalled it and I broke the iPad
[1069.85s -> 1074.41s]  over my knee. That's what happened. Fuck, forgot. That was so long ago though. It was like a few
[1074.41s -> 1089.35s]  months ago. Okay, can I get there from here? Probably. Or is it too low? Is it high or up
[1089.35s -> 1097.75s]  or is it lower? Shit, it's right there. It's literally right there. The way you guys are
[1097.75s -> 1110.34s]  telling me to go. Is there a jump over here? All right, I'm gonna have to go from here and then go
[1110.34s -> 1124.70s]  left. Yeah, what I'm doing right now is I'm trying... I'm getting the... I'm going to get the best
[1124.70s -> 1133.27s]  spell in the game apparently. This is apparently the best sorcery in the whole game from what I've
[1133.27s -> 1145.67s]  been told. It just melts people. It's ridiculous, apparently. Okay, now is there a way I can go
[1145.67s -> 1154.33s]  around? What is attacking me? Oh shit, I didn't even do Atlas Plateau. I just like snoozed through
[1154.33s -> 1167.42s]  this place. I didn't do any of this. All right, be strong, I'll do it. Okay, is this whole area
[1168.06s -> 1186.12s]  Perfumer's Ruins? I mean, let's see what's here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm looking...
[1186.12s -> 1203.83s]  I'm facing the wrong way. I'm just trying to get a spell here because you stink.
[1206.46s -> 1231.37s]  Ta-da. So, from here, where do I go? Oh, a chest. Oh, nice! I'm from this cookbook.
[1232.94s -> 1250.92s]  Holy shit! Is there a place to go down? Cave moss. Cool, okay. There's probably a way to go down.
[1250.92s -> 1262.76s]  Maybe that's it. Perfume bottle. Those are like the flasks. I haven't used them the whole game.
[1265.91s -> 1277.67s]  Anywhere to go down, like a dungeon or something? Or another. What's that? Yep, very nice.
[1278.31s -> 1297.74s]  Perfumer's Talisman. The perfume bottle thing, I don't... Raises potency of perfume items.
[1301.43s -> 1307.58s]  I don't know. This is a lot. Me strong, I'll take care of it. Why do your lips look so greasy?
[1307.58s -> 1316.74s]  Did you eat KFC recently? Oh, man, I love that. I love that extra crispy combo.
[1329.91s -> 1342.50s]  It's... God, I fucking love KFC more than anything. After you eat KFC, you can smell it on your face
[1342.50s -> 1346.50s]  for at least an hour, even if you wipe your mouth and wash your face and stuff.
[1347.14s -> 1357.96s]  That's disgusting, by the way. It is. Okay, I think I got everything here. Let's keep going.
[1358.68s -> 1366.54s]  I need to go over this way. I actually don't want to get zits on my chin.
[1368.31s -> 1370.87s]  All right, we're going to four. How can I get to four? Around here?
[1371.83s -> 1402.60s]  No, around here. Shit! How do I get over there? This guy's a bit greasy. I think I have to go
[1402.60s -> 1411.98s]  from the lava place, yeah. Unless is there a... Can I go through here? Is it like a dungeon or
[1411.98s -> 1436.18s]  something? There's definitely something here. Here we go. All right, let's go. Yep. Sage's Cave.
[1436.82s -> 1457.42s]  I don't have a... You know the move. KFC Manor. There it is. Not like...
[1463.43s -> 1471.45s]  Yeah, so there's this move. There's a spell. There's a fake wall. So I know that there are
[1471.69s -> 1478.57s]  a few more spells. And I need your help. This is the backseat stream. This is the stream where
[1478.57s -> 1483.93s]  it's a late night stream. And we're trying to get to the end. Trying to get as powerful as we can.
[1483.93s -> 1494.20s]  I'm ready to be backseated. All right, I can go this way. Wait, what about down here?
[1496.95s -> 1509.78s]  Every stream so far has been a backseat stream. Yeah. All right, I can't make that. There's two
[1509.78s -> 1527.10s]  bosses in this dungeon. Really? Pretty cool. There's a very useful chess piece here. Okay.
[1529.05s -> 1537.43s]  Because... All right. Everyone tells me about this laser beam move. I know it exists. They're
[1537.43s -> 1541.11s]  saying, dude, just go get the laser beam, please. For the love of God, just go get the laser beam.
[1541.11s -> 1547.94s]  It's cool. And I'm like, all right. So that's... I want to use the laser beam on Millennium.
[1548.74s -> 1558.47s]  Understand? And if it is what I think it's going to do, I have an idea. Can I actually not make
[1558.47s -> 1580.33s]  that? Whatever. I'm scared. There's two chests? Dude. Lost Ashes of War. Rejuvenating Ballaces.
[1580.33s -> 1587.77s]  It sucks. It's cheese. Um, that's fine. I know that there's at least three spells that I... And
[1587.77s -> 1596.01s]  plus I want to... I've gone the whole game without using any of the ridiculous, like, dump 80 points
[1596.01s -> 1600.01s]  into sorcery and just do the beam at every boss. I haven't done that. And you know I haven't.
[1602.17s -> 1607.69s]  I haven't done that. So if there's one opportunity I'm going to take
[1608.65s -> 1616.44s]  to do that move to someone, it's going to be Millennium. I'm gonna hold on to it. And I'm
[1616.44s -> 1639.56s]  gonna just... I'm gonna keep it in the back pocket. Mr. Wall. Back here. Hello. My God, there's a lot
[1639.56s -> 1650.70s]  of you in this room. This will be good for these guys because it'll hit them when they're on the
[1650.70s -> 1671.98s]  ground. God, I can't see. Come on, Starlight Kid. Do it already. Bandit's Curve Sword. I don't even
[1671.98s -> 1680.98s]  need to look at it. Oh my God, what the fuck? This feels, um, this feels like Mario Party.
[1680.98s -> 1685.30s]  Like, I feel like if I, like, we're all gonna take a turn and then it's gonna blow up in our face.
[1686.10s -> 1712.81s]  Okay. Black Hood. Candle Tree Wooden Shield. And Butterfly. Is it? What is the Candle Tree
[1712.81s -> 1727.82s]  Wooden Shield? Light for its eyes, easy to handle. About to represent a sur- surrepetitious prophecy
[1727.82s -> 1734.74s]  of cardinal sin. The lit candle tree design was forbidden. Lit candle tree? A burning urtree?
[1739.16s -> 1749.88s]  How did you just pronounce that? I don't know. I just guessed. Looks like I got it right.
[1750.52s -> 1764.01s]  Hey, chat. Did you tell Jerm about the thing? I think they did. The R place. Very aware.
[1764.73s -> 1778.33s]  I have no orders. There are no orders for you. This guy still doesn't have a lantern. Nope.
[1779.05s -> 1796.44s]  This is lantern, uh, any percent. No lantern, any percent. Star and Sword key.
[1798.33s -> 1810.23s]  Very cool. You beat Godfrey with no lantern. Yeah. And wood again, my lord.
[1822.17s -> 1826.01s]  Raptor Talons? What is that? Why are there so many chests everywhere?
[1826.73s -> 1835.90s]  This is the most chests that I've ever been in a dungeon. Baseline of deck scaling C.
[1836.86s -> 1841.21s]  Claw? What is it? Claw comprised of two sharp thin blades
[1841.93s -> 1855.06s]  built by the assassins of Ravenmount to imitate the death birds. That's really good for PvP.
[1859.02s -> 1863.72s]  Golden Great Arrow. Why are there so many chests here? This is getting the shit out of me.
[1878.09s -> 1895.37s]  Uh, over here? There's so much stuff. Skeletal Mask and Raptor's Black Feathers. Whoa.
[1896.17s -> 1915.54s]  Where's the mask? Skeletal Mask. Where is it? Skeletal Mask that tightly grips the face,
[1916.18s -> 1922.34s]  worn by the assassins of Ravenmount. This ritual implement relentlessly digs into the wearer's face,
[1922.98s -> 1926.82s]  preserving one's human instincts while dressed in imitation of the death birds.
[1927.62s -> 1947.54s]  That's interesting. What is this? I have so much stuff. A Raptor's Black Feathers focus and vitality
[1947.54s -> 1954.87s]  really high. Transforming into ritual? We're transforming into a death bird, if only by
[1954.87s -> 1968.38s]  imitation. Strengthens jump attacks. That's kind of cool. That's really cool. It's bloodborne armor.
[1968.38s -> 1980.95s]  It does kind of look like bloodborne armor. You're right. The boss. I'm so unbelievably
[1980.95s -> 1995.98s]  overleveled for this. Like, come on, I can do it, right? Necromancer Garrus. Necromancer
[1995.98s -> 2009.21s]  Garrus is gonna fucking die in another one hit. All right, I got him. Doesn't come back, right?
[2010.23s -> 2022.26s]  Family heads? What the hell is that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Garrus. I was way more overprepared.
[2023.14s -> 2033.80s]  It's a staff. Three bludgeoning copper heads attached to it. It's a flail. The heads were
[2033.80s -> 2043.06s]  made to resemble those of his wife and two children. Gently rattle the copper heads to
[2043.06s -> 2048.20s]  summon vengeful spirits that chase down foes. The anguish of a spouse and children.
[2048.68s -> 2055.64s]  Invites a cursed wrath. Let me see this thing. Oh my god, this thing's fucking morbid.
[2058.10s -> 2075.43s]  What does it do? Oh, that's kind of cool. Interesting. All right. Well, that's cool.
[2078.04s -> 2088.44s]  I don't think I want to go to the beginning of the dungeon. That is an act. That's an actual
[2088.44s -> 2100.98s]  rat. It's a baby rattle. Well, it's a it's a it's a flail that has some stuff. It's attached to
[2101.94s -> 2109.45s]  this. This is the baby rattle. Hurry up and fucking stall like it. All right, that was cool. In
[2109.45s -> 2117.21s]  the necromancer, I'm sure 70 to 80 levels ago may have been a tad more difficult, but you know,
[2117.21s -> 2130.97s]  this is what it is. I'm here for the spell. Okay, we're already here. Black knife assassin.
[2134.04s -> 2141.56s]  It's I can see the footprints. Okay, I would be really scared right now if I couldn't just do this.
[2154.74s -> 2187.93s]  Hmm. I don't have any mana left. Oh shit. Fuck. Oh, I just got him. That would have been so awful
[2187.93s -> 2202.63s]  back at like level 60 or 80. Concealing veil. Conceals wear while crouching. What? What do you
[2202.63s -> 2223.64s]  mean? It's invisible? Am I invisible? How can I tell if I'm invisible? Well, that's really cool.
[2224.12s -> 2235.29s]  Is it bizarre? Let's put this back on. What's here? Oh, the damage. The damage one.
[2237.06s -> 2249.18s]  All right, so that is not what I wanted. I wanted to go over here. This is not the way I wanted to
[2249.18s -> 2263.05s]  go. Can I get out of here somewhere else? Can I keep going? You need to go to volcano manor and
[2263.05s -> 2274.87s]  then around the volcano. You have to go around the entire mountain. All right, well, so if I go here,
[2275.43s -> 2283.67s]  I can, can I go like this way? Instructions to find comet Azor in alert channel. Oh shit.
[2284.47s -> 2314.70s]  Directions. Around Mount Gelmer through a canyon. Start from the abandoned coffin bonfire and go
[2314.70s -> 2319.98s]  uphill to the northeast. This is VR Josh, by the way. He's just got my back on this one. Start from
[2319.98s -> 2330.34s]  the abandoned coffin. Start from the abandoned coffin bonfire and go uphill to the northeast.
[2330.34s -> 2336.44s]  Then go north slash northwest through a canyon. Hug the canyon's left wall and it will loop
[2336.44s -> 2341.16s]  around Mount Gelmer counterclockwise. You'll come to a castle, go left from that castle,
[2341.16s -> 2344.76s]  pass some lava fields and through some rocks. You'll go past some advanced shacks.
[2345.48s -> 2352.36s]  Beyond those is a magic boss. Oh my god, this is a lot. I'm going to do this step by step. Okay.
[2355.32s -> 2366.73s]  Go uphill to the northeast. Northeast. Uphill. VR Josh would beat Jerma in a fight, I think.
[2366.73s -> 2379.98s]  Probably. Okay, I haven't gone this way. Why, okay, oh wait a minute. Being able to take out,
[2379.98s -> 2384.78s]  what the fuck is that? Being able to have, to be able to give somebody directions means I can beat
[2384.78s -> 2401.19s]  you up? What are you talking about? Ancient dragon lancex? Oh my god, good thing I'm here way early.
[2401.19s -> 2417.11s]  Late. Just eat all this damage. I'm so powerful. I'm, I'm sorry, uh, lancex, but you're dealing
[2417.11s -> 2423.85s]  with somebody that is about to fight, that's been fighting the final, all right, you got the hint.
[2423.85s -> 2434.94s]  You took, you took the hint. Okay, uh, so north, north, yeah, I would leave too. Lancex just landed
[2434.94s -> 2439.88s]  and was like, oh, what's this new area? Oh no, no, no, no, no, I'm way, I'm way too underleveled for
[2439.88s -> 2443.24s]  this. I'm way too underleveled. This game's fucking stupid. How was I supposed to know I wasn't
[2443.24s -> 2454.17s]  supposed to be here? And he turned around. He's complaining to his chat right now. How the fuck
[2454.17s -> 2464.23s]  was I ever supposed to know that? What level are these guys? That's so fucking stupid. Okay, that
[2464.23s -> 2473.66s]  was cool. Hug the canyon's left wall and then loop around Mount Gelmer. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[2474.38s -> 2489.61s]  Okay, this is crazy. I wasn't even over here. Okay, there's the tibia mariner. This is an
[2489.61s -> 2495.45s]  elaborate April's rules joke to get me to come over here. All right, can I kill the tibia mariner
[2495.45s -> 2515.96s]  in three hits? What do you guys think? Where do you go? There you are. Three hits. Here we go.
[2518.44s -> 2523.77s]  One. Nope, not gonna happen. You got a lot more. You got a ton of health this time.
[2529.08s -> 2547.91s]  Oh, he must be resistant to cold. I thought he just knocked him over. I thought that was
[2547.91s -> 2560.50s]  way too much of like a wave that the skeleton made. Could be a mariner. Dead. It's gonna be.
[2560.50s -> 2581.78s]  Deathroot and tibia's summons. Easy class. Tibia's summons. It's a sorcery. Oh, it's an
[2581.86s -> 2589.78s]  int and faith. 28 int 20 faith. Summons a group of those lost in death. Three skeletons will appear
[2589.78s -> 2596.07s]  from some distance from the caster. Are they huge? I don't want the faith. That's cool though.
[2596.95s -> 2606.92s]  Okay, wait. I don't want to fuck the instructions. We'll come to a castle. Go left from that castle
[2606.92s -> 2621.91s]  past some lava fields. Shit. Fuck. I messed it up. Where were we? Not near the castle yet. Okay,
[2621.91s -> 2644.50s]  so I just keep going this way? Over here? Oh, this is grace. I think this is it.
[2649.40s -> 2661.56s]  Yes. Okay, this is definitely it. But how do I get up there? Stay at the bottom.
[2662.12s -> 2680.54s]  Over here. Following the instructions, monkey. Mirage. At the end of the canyon is the castle.
[2685.45s -> 2697.94s]  God. Oh my god. Fucking lava bursts. Watch out. I think I have. I have five. I can do another
[2697.94s -> 2722.87s]  flask upgrade. That hurts. Come on. What's up? Oh, he doesn't know. He doesn't know. What do I
[2722.87s -> 2732.06s]  not know? Can you please be nicer? My little brother is watching. I'll say 50% less swears
[2732.70s -> 2749.78s]  for the next 30 minutes. See the water. So getting it off there. I want to yell it so bad.
[2750.50s -> 2755.90s]  I want to just put like epic music and just do the intro as hard as I can.
[2756.62s -> 2792.78s]  Well, this is a dungeon. Wait, that is. No, there's actually nothing in here. Please do it.
[2796.76s -> 2801.48s]  That's like, that's just me. That's just, I'm, you want me to do what you want to do a fan,
[2801.48s -> 2816.02s]  like a fan dub. You want me to do a dub like a fan dub on stream. Poison. I'll think about it.
[2816.02s -> 2840.82s]  What if I get it wrong though? I might not get it right. Who cares? Okay, you will get it wrong.
[2840.82s -> 2845.06s]  I probably will get it right. Actually, cause I've seen the intro of fucking absolute shit.
[2846.10s -> 2851.96s]  I'm going to get poisoned. Who gives a shit. All right. I got to pay attention because I
[2852.52s -> 2855.72s]  can't talk about that right now. No illusory walls.
[2886.41s -> 2897.00s]  When will you learn it's illusory, illusory, illusory, illusory wall, illusory.
[2899.58s -> 2903.66s]  You do it phonetically like bump dash bump, death dash bump.
[2909.62s -> 2919.14s]  Illusory, illusory, illusory, illusory. That sucks. That's not, that's, I don't like it.
[2920.02s -> 2927.43s]  Illusory, illusory, illusory. No, no, no. It's illusory. It's illusory. It sounds way cooler
[2927.43s -> 2935.72s]  that way. Illusory wall. Oh, there's an illusory wall. That doesn't sound right. An illusory wall.
[2936.20s -> 2958.33s]  An illusory wall. An illusion. Not an illusion. Illusion. Stop reinventing English.
[2960.33s -> 2965.77s]  Illusory. I don't even know how it was said. Somebody said it and I just don't remember.
[2965.77s -> 2968.09s]  Okay. Well, this is a bunch of re shit right here.
[2979.38s -> 2986.58s]  Oh, I actually could have just walked in and done that. I'm too flashy for flashy sake.
[2987.54s -> 3012.07s]  Uh, I had a mana? What? Fuck up. Fuck up. I, there's no way I don't have mana.
[3012.07s -> 3028.02s]  Mushroom body, mushroom arms, mushroom legs. Mushroom body. Mushrooms found growing all over
[3028.02s -> 3034.41s]  the body. These overgrown mushrooms have colonized the torso. Those enraptured by the scarlet rot,
[3034.41s -> 3063.86s]  they are holy vestments that root one to the earth. It just looks like, hold on,
[3063.86s -> 3081.26s]  put my like weapons away. Just like sit on the ground. Okay. I, I now have a rune arc on me.
[3082.30s -> 3086.25s]  I like just sit here in the corner and just have like an item on me.
[3086.97s -> 3116.41s]  We're taking that off. Oh no. The bull goat armor. Holy shit. That's actually, I'm not at heavy,
[3116.41s -> 3130.41s]  right? As long as I say medium, I'm fine. Dragon gauntlets. I could put the bull,
[3130.41s -> 3133.29s]  the bull goat stuff on. Almost the whole thing. Can I put the whole thing on?
[3134.25s -> 3144.02s]  No. Nope. My pants have to be, uh, light. Oh no, I can't wear pants at all. I can wear these
[3144.02s -> 3155.40s]  trousers. I actually, I don't hate this. This is actually, I didn't realize what that, I didn't
[3155.40s -> 3163.91s]  realize that. I didn't realize that they came out like that. Clipping through the hat. Damn it.
[3164.55s -> 3174.78s]  I can't wear it. That'll drive me fucking crazy. I like this the most, I think. No, the blue one.
[3174.86s -> 3191.86s]  This one. Yeah. This is my favorite so far. I want like blue. Yeah. I like that.
[3192.74s -> 3203.27s]  That's really cool. That matches really well. The whole thing matches now. Okay. Well, now where?
[3203.27s -> 3240.06s]  Now where else to go? Where am I supposed to go from here? Uh, that way? Honest to God, dude.
[3240.70s -> 3262.97s]  He can't even cast. There's four people. It doesn't matter how much HP that I have.
[3262.97s -> 3287.50s]  There's four people shooting at me. You know what I mean? No, dickhead. I already went this way.
[3287.50s -> 3297.93s]  We're gonna go that way. Yeah, because this is, this is like the end of the waterfall or something.
[3297.93s -> 3314.95s]  Or can I go here? Oh no, I can't go here. Or unloved. Thief to the Badlands. What? Why did
[3314.95s -> 3335.96s]  that happen? Oh, thank God. It was one of those right there. That's actually not a bad thing.
[3335.96s -> 3345.69s]  That was a good thing. I got a refill of my flask. Okay, so be careful because it keeps going.
[3347.66s -> 3367.70s]  I got kind of unlucky, didn't I? I got really unlucky. This is safe. Sir Gideon Andy?
[3371.82s -> 3381.85s]  Oraloo Andy. Thief to the Badlands. The effa brilliant gold mask Andy. The lonesome
[3381.85s -> 3397.88s]  dung eater Andy. You guys really know how to ruin things. Oh, okay. All right. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[3400.49s -> 3413.18s]  Okay. I have to hit you once. Oh my God. I'm so glad I'm not doing you at the correct level
[3413.18s -> 3424.49s]  because this would suck. I almost killed him in one hit. That was pretty cool. All right, cool.
[3425.80s -> 3445.00s]  Hindered of rot's exultation. Yeah, it's definitely okay. Poisoning or rot in vicinity increases
[3445.00s -> 3453.14s]  attack power. Raise attack power when poisoning or rot occurs in the vicinity. Raise attack power
[3453.14s -> 3470.01s]  when blood loss occurs in the vicinity. Would be good for millennia. Holy shit. How's that person
[3470.01s -> 3474.97s]  gonna get VIP'd and then don't do it? You know what I mean? Like the thought is there.
[3488.09s -> 3499.88s]  The lonesome Andy. Sir Gideon Andy. Oh my God. Like that's so, I hate it. Okay, so I was,
[3499.88s -> 3513.64s]  that was kind of cool. I didn't do any of this shit. Lonesome ass eater. Ew, ew, ew, ew.
[3514.68s -> 3529.13s]  I'm sorry. I'm overdoing it. Lonesome ass eater. Stop. This thing's stupid.
[3530.79s -> 3550.41s]  The lonesome ass. Imagine that was his name. Oh, hey, I can see it. That's the castle that,
[3550.49s -> 3574.97s]  uh, that, that, that VRJaws said. This is a fucking long way to get over here. Okay.
[3576.60s -> 3585.59s]  Wait, what the fuck? What? This, this is not right. I'm all the way across the whole thing now.
[3590.55s -> 3594.49s]  Is this the, wait, what does it say? When you get to the castle, go left from that castle,
[3594.49s -> 3601.32s]  pass some lava fields and through some rocks. You circle around the whole thing.
[3602.04s -> 3625.53s]  And Sir Gideon ass eater. The lonesome dung eater. I'm sorry. This is this it? What the
[3625.53s -> 3643.85s]  fuck is with all these random bosses? Another, okay. Magma worm. Don't even get up. Just stay
[3643.85s -> 3684.81s]  here. Do not go into the lava. Frost him. Come on. Frost him. There it is. Yeah. Let's end it
[3684.81s -> 3694.97s]  with a flashy move. All right. I'm slowly cleaning up all this shit that I didn't do.
[3695.29s -> 3704.20s]  Dragon heart. New draconic power is available. Okay. So you come to a castle, go left.
[3705.08s -> 3710.12s]  Sir, that circle, pass some lava fields and through some rocks. You'll go past some abandoned shacks.
[3710.76s -> 3731.05s]  So you want to go through the lava like this way. What about Alexander? What? This hurts.
[3731.77s -> 3753.16s]  You need the boots.
[3753.16s -> 3795.67s]  He's still alive. Jar.
[3822.70s -> 3835.74s]  Okay. Anything else? No. What did he say? Icy giant's peak. Lame of ruin.
[3840.41s -> 3861.98s]  I burnt the urtree though. He still do that. The jar on. Hold on. Torrent's like dead.
[3863.11s -> 3873.48s]  Is it a helmet? Jar. Jar that fits cleanly over the head when upturned. Made with pride by iron
[3873.48s -> 3879.00s]  fist Alexander. In a uniquely jar-like gesture of friendship, it boosts the power of throwing pot
[3879.00s -> 3901.64s]  items. That's so dumb. You could summon him for the fire giant. Really? That's cool. That's really
[3901.64s -> 3916.41s]  cool. All right. So I keep going. And then it says finally abandoned shacks. What is this?
[3917.05s -> 3923.72s]  I missed when the jar was yelling.
[3946.97s -> 3973.46s]  Okay. I don't want to. This route sucks by the way. You gave me directions through three bosses.
[3974.26s -> 3981.64s]  It's the only way? Why is this place riddled with fucking animals and bosses? I think that hurt a
[3981.64s -> 3986.44s]  lot. This is literally the only way. All right. Well, now I have to fight one of these.
[3987.32s -> 3998.71s]  Oh, that was rude. What I just did. It didn't even hurt him. Why did all these people come from?
[3999.67s -> 4016.34s]  What the fuck? All right. I have to actually pay attention to this. Oh my God. Why are you?
[4017.14s -> 4027.90s]  I want to get me out of here. I'm going to go up the fucking cliff. I know it.
[4027.90s -> 4064.82s]  I don't know where I am. Where did I go? God damn it. I'm running by it. I don't want to
[4064.82s -> 4069.70s]  fight that. I was already going too fast. I could have just the thing jumped from like stage left
[4069.70s -> 4074.82s]  and I saw like the corner of it. I should have just kept going. I should have. I got way too
[4074.82s -> 4080.18s]  overconfident because I killed every boss in like less than 10 seconds. And that bear was not easy.
[4080.98s -> 4105.24s]  That was horrible. Go around the lava. I'm already here. I don't care about this. Just go
[4105.24s -> 4125.78s]  this way. Where is he? Wait, what's in here? What? Roiling magma. Okay. That's kind of cool.
[4130.14s -> 4158.12s]  Okay. There he is. Items spraying his ankle. What was that? Don't you fucking dare. Get the
[4158.12s -> 4162.52s]  fuck out of here. How did they even get up here? How did they get up here? They can't, you can't
[4162.52s -> 4171.78s]  jump up here. Do you see how you can't do that? I had to use the horse. I didn't want to do that
[4171.78s -> 4184.30s]  dumb fucking move. You can't get up there, right? Oh my god. This is not possible. You can not jump
[4184.30s -> 4206.97s]  up here. He's so menacing. Did he shit out a little bear? What was that? Where did that other bear
[4206.97s -> 4255.99s]  come from? That was so terrible. That was so weird. That was just so sad. It rolled so far.
[4256.63s -> 4262.95s]  It rolled from here slowly all the way over there in tiny revolutions. That was so awful.
[4264.47s -> 4270.95s]  Oh my god. I feel awful. My whole body feels bad. It rolled for a full two minutes.
[4279.90s -> 4296.63s]  Okay. So now we're here. That's slow. Pulley crossbow. Wow. Pulley crossbow. Let me see it.
[4297.27s -> 4310.25s]  Okay. Cool. Crossbow made with pulleys and power springs. One in the chat if anyone's fired this
[4310.25s -> 4343.35s]  weapon. Liars. I think I have enough to roll up. 140. I need 139. I think I got it.
[4343.35s -> 4352.52s]  Okay. That's actually kind of nice. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait. Hold on.
[4353.16s -> 4364.95s]  Wait. I have horror. Horror lose. I do. Did I look at this? Why did I not break that?
[4378.31s -> 4390.52s]  139 is what I need. Did you beat that boss? Nope. Nope. I'm preparing for that boss.
[4391.64s -> 4401.16s]  Because she kicked the ever-living shit out of me a day and a half ago. I turned purple.
[4401.16s -> 4425.50s]  All right. I was horrible. Why do I really not have enough? I don't know. No. Dude. How could
[4425.50s -> 4432.14s]  you even consider it? I just saw a huge bunch, like a big crowd of enemies. And I'm like, all
[4432.14s -> 4439.34s]  right. And then I realized what it was. And I was just for a second, I was like, this sheep.
[4440.30s -> 4449.10s]  Okay. I thought these were sheep. Get away from the sheep. Sheep. Get out of here.
[4449.10s -> 4464.98s]  I don't want to accidentally kill the entire fucking family. 139 is what I need. It's bones.
[4466.06s -> 4480.06s]  130. Okay. I need 139 for God's sakes. Whatever. I don't. We're on the right track.
[4480.06s -> 4483.74s]  Now, last time I did like a sheep sound, everybody fucking freaked out and like people left the
[4483.74s -> 4490.38s]  scream. Well, like, shut the fuck up. It wasn't funny. It was like, I'm leaving. Don't fucking do
[4490.38s -> 4497.21s]  like a dumb sheep sound. Do you remember that? I don't think you guys remember like the sheep
[4497.21s -> 4502.49s]  that I did. And everyone got really mad. It wasn't like funny mad. It was like, don't fucking do that
[4502.49s -> 4507.32s]  again, dude. That wasn't funny. That sucked. I distinctly remember that. And I was like,
[4507.32s -> 4513.06s]  holy shit. People really didn't like that. And again, I'm not messing around. It wasn't like,
[4513.06s -> 4524.31s]  oh, dude. What the fuck? It was like a don't fucking do that again. Okay. What the fuck is
[4524.31s -> 4553.40s]  happening in this game today? Even though he died. He just got cut in half long ways. Like,
[4553.40s -> 4559.08s]  he was like, I'm ready. Okay, here we go. Yeah. Like, he's one of those, he's going to go like this.
[4562.41s -> 4568.10s]  He's going to go in half. He's not even going to know why they all so fucked up today.
[4568.90s -> 4572.66s]  Don't you feel like they're like, the enemies are weird today?
[4574.84s -> 4578.20s]  Something's weird is going on. What's happening? Why is everyone so fucked up?
[4578.92s -> 4612.74s]  Go level up. You're living eternally in a 1900 slapstick movie. You know, I miss like the piano
[4612.74s -> 4622.50s]  playing. Like the classic piano. Like. With people just getting hit and like hitting each other and
[4622.50s -> 4631.51s]  stuff and like falling down stairs and stuff. Like that's fucking hilarious. Endurance probably,
[4631.51s -> 4643.27s]  right? Or 60. Yeah. There's a scene in Leslie Nielsen in one of the naked gun movies where like
[4643.27s -> 4648.07s]  he's in an apartment, like doing an investigation, looking for like a clue. And he like bumps into
[4648.07s -> 4652.79s]  an automatic, he bumps into a piano. Like he falls over and like hits bumps into a piano
[4652.79s -> 4660.79s]  and starts playing this like classical, like automatic piano music. And he starts like
[4661.27s -> 4665.75s]  falling into the walls and breaking shit. And they like ends up burning the whole place down
[4665.75s -> 4673.67s]  or something. I remember just laughing at the piano. I don't know. Pianos do it to me.
[4674.39s -> 4682.02s]  I think we're really missing like the old high school theater old lady that plays the piano.
[4682.82s -> 4687.98s]  Do you guys remember that? I don't know what it's like in like high school now or like middle school
[4687.98s -> 4696.10s]  now. But there was one old lady that did the entire soundtrack of the entire play. And it was
[4696.50s -> 4703.72s]  it was a little scuffed. It was always a little bit scuffed. But this lady worked it all night.
[4705.16s -> 4722.17s]  All night. Every song, every tense moment, all the tense music. I was that I just got a cool weapon.
[4741.19s -> 4748.50s]  This boss alley. It's this literally is boss alley. They all decided to hang out here.
[4749.14s -> 4754.71s]  This probably would have taken like 15 in game hours to go through this place.
[4754.71s -> 4757.19s]  Like at level 60 or 70 when you're supposed to be here.
[4767.45s -> 4787.90s]  This where they there's casters here. Get out of here. How many people are here?
[4813.58s -> 4827.83s]  I can imagine like the old lady playing the piano right now.
[4827.83s -> 4846.78s]  I think sometimes you can hear her like say a fucking really really bad swear too.
[4848.30s -> 4853.69s]  Fuck. She'd be like ah this piece of shit. Like she'd turn her music over and she'd swear.
[4853.69s -> 4888.14s]  It was like Jesus. Okay so what did I just get? Oh a memory stone. That's all right.
[4888.14s -> 4906.01s]  I'm not going over there yet. Most OP spell in the game. This is well all right so
[4906.81s -> 4940.50s]  Homet Azur. Can you talk? Okay well can I do anything else? All right I want to see what this
[4940.50s -> 4952.15s]  does. Play ragtime music. Oh wait I got something over here too. Roiling magma in faith. Okay a lot
[4952.15s -> 4963.56s]  of these fire spells are in faith. Kind of interesting. Okay where is it? Fire is a
[4963.56s -> 4998.15s]  tremendous comment within Astari Torm. It takes three slots. Shit. Wow. Oh okay I have the- wait
[4998.15s -> 5028.62s]  a minute. So theoretically I already have this on. If I do this. Oh my goodness. It's not going to
[5028.62s -> 5047.78s]  work versus them. There's a hair in here and I got to get it out. I got it. Oh oh my god this is
[5047.78s -> 5054.89s]  one of my hairs. This is long. This is like one of my hairs. That's what the fuck. It was in there.
[5054.89s -> 5065.99s]  Like coiled up. That's disgusting. Okay so um you say that's not going to work versus. All right
[5066.63s -> 5071.75s]  where is the other spell? Somebody said they were- I see there's a few super spells. I want to get
[5071.75s -> 5082.65s]  them because this is it. It's not- I'm not- this is it. This is it. Is there another one? Oh talk to
[5082.65s -> 5092.87s]  Selen in limb grave. Rocksling is really good. The other one. Talk to Selen about this guy. I have
[5092.87s -> 5101.11s]  it already. It's swarm of flies. Selen's quest. Use that when you dodge the big flower in phase two.
[5101.11s -> 5108.58s]  Oh man. Can we just do it now? Let's just go do it now. Let's go do it right now. Let's go kill her
[5108.58s -> 5115.72s]  right now. What do you guys think? What do you guys think? First try? We go do it first try?
[5115.72s -> 5154.95s]  We do it right now? You think? Linestone pebble is better. Okay last charges. Uh I'm gonna say
[5156.15s -> 5165.24s]  10 and 4. Let's just see. We gotta get to phase two. I'm not using this until phase two. If I
[5165.24s -> 5173.21s]  beat this. If I drink that flask and melt her. Probably gonna get a lot of shit for it because
[5173.21s -> 5181.05s]  you didn't beat Melania the way that I did which was soul level 80 and uh a short sword.
[5181.77s -> 5208.71s]  Well I'm sorry but let's go. Bombo you ready? All right Melania. Begin the process. Come on
[5208.71s -> 5236.92s]  Bombo. Old headphones gotta go in otherwise this ain't happening. Stagger! Where's the Stagger?
[5238.12s -> 5262.07s]  Oh my god. Do it right away? No fucking chance man. I gotta get her phase two. She stands still
[5262.07s -> 5271.69s]  in phase two for like five to ten straight seconds when she lands. And you know what?
[5271.69s -> 5287.74s]  We're going rune arc as well. Let's do it. Bombo! Let's do it. Can I get two moons off? No. I don't
[5287.74s -> 5304.12s]  think so. Let's fuck who cares. Let's do it. Got it. All right let's go. Come on Bombo. Fire!
[5304.84s -> 5325.32s]  Hit her in the fire. No!
[5330.33s -> 5357.86s]  You tried dodging that attack? I don't think you can. By the time you dodge the first part of it
[5358.42s -> 5366.79s]  she's still the animation is still happening. You can. It's just hard. This boss is dumb. I can't
[5366.79s -> 5399.53s]  wait to burn her face off with this fucking spell. In the fire. Good good good. Stagger up.
[5400.17s -> 5418.89s]  All right back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Run run run run run run run. I'm paranoid that she's
[5418.89s -> 5429.06s]  gonna do it again. I'm so paranoid. She's gonna do it again. She's gonna do it again. Right? Like
[5429.06s -> 5449.83s]  she's gonna do it again right now. My god I can't even see. I don't want to use the laser spell yet.
[5450.47s -> 5458.34s]  She never does it twice in a row. I feel like I've seen her do it twice in a row.
[5458.98s -> 5468.49s]  Use the moon blade? Bro that's the only move I'm doing this whole entire fight.
[5469.64s -> 5472.04s]  You know what? Fuck it. Let's just see what happens. I'm just doing it right now. Go!
[5478.82s -> 5501.13s]  What? Doesn't work. It's gonna work in phase two because she stands still for like five straight
[5501.13s -> 5508.76s]  seconds in phase two. I just have to get her to phase two. Just kill me. I don't want to waste
[5508.76s -> 5530.81s]  blasts. No reason. Just kill me. She's really weak to bleed. I can get her down. I've gotten her to
[5530.81s -> 5538.17s]  phase two plenty of times. It's just doing it. You need to play ragtime piano. It's the only way.
[5540.60s -> 5556.10s]  You know I've considered it. I considered it. Ragtime piano music royalty free?
[5586.97s -> 5596.97s]  Whatever.
[5612.71s -> 5615.11s]  Come on Bombo. Let's go.
[5642.26s -> 5695.08s]  Please. Bombo aggro. She's full health again. Oh god damn it. There's no fucking way.
[5695.88s -> 5707.06s]  Not anymore. Not without Bombo. Bombo. She just. Okay. You live by the summon, you die by the
[5707.06s -> 5713.14s]  summon. She generates almost a hundred percent of her health back if she does that to the summon.
[5714.10s -> 5719.54s]  She just ate him fucking alive. That was stupid. She shouldn't be able to gain health from the
[5719.54s -> 5770.38s]  summon if the summon didn't have any blood. This is gonna be so hard without Bombo. I'm so afraid
[5770.38s -> 5781.03s]  she's gonna do it. Just do it already. Just do it. I know you're gonna do it. Just do it already.
[5781.03s -> 5835.35s]  Do it already. I got the black and white filter. And I'll top it with one of these accents.
[5835.91s -> 5845.94s]  That sounds like a good idea. Okay. That sounds fun to me. That's like fucking grainy. All right.
[5845.94s -> 5886.28s]  Hold on. The whole thing. What if I beat her? It's gonna be ruined. The clip is gonna be fucking
[5886.28s -> 5929.64s]  ruined. Hold on. Hold on. I need to. I wish I had a cigarette. I need like a suit jacket,
[5929.64s -> 5947.50s]  too. You know what I mean? This could be a cigarette. This clean lady down here. I'm
[5947.50s -> 5958.49s]  really not gonna try. A new tactic, I think. Alice. Alice, listen to me. The new tactic is gonna go
[5958.49s -> 5964.30s]  like this. I'm thinking we wait till we get to the bottom. Radio filter. Yep. That's true.
[5965.02s -> 5991.48s]  Actually, good call. Let me make sure I get this right. Okay. So, okay. So, what we're gonna do
[5991.48s -> 6004.94s]  here is we're gonna make sure I get this right. Let's go ahead and bring this up a little bit here.
[6006.78s -> 6010.70s]  Does that sound better? Does that sound good? How does that sound? Maybe a little bit. That's
[6010.70s -> 6020.36s]  a little too much. I think that's a little too much. Yeah, I think so. Now, you see? How's that?
[6021.48s -> 6026.60s]  Okay. That sounds pretty good to me. Now, let's go ahead and get this started, I say. You know,
[6026.60s -> 6046.28s]  I say. I'll tell you, I'm gonna be hollering here. I'm gonna be hollering here. Get down here.
[6047.32s -> 6054.33s]  I'm gonna make sure that we take care of this as soon as possible. I'm thinking summoning Mambo
[6055.21s -> 6064.49s]  for the first quadrant of this fight. Mambo, why don't you come sailing out here, please?
[6065.13s -> 6070.44s]  That sounds good to me. Show of the moon. Show of the moon. What do you say? Show of the moon.
[6070.44s -> 6081.77s]  What do you think, Mambo? Sure thing. Absolutely. Oh, rats. Rats, rats, rats. Rats.
[6082.57s -> 6091.42s]  That looked a little hairy there. I say, I say, you get your hands off him. That's my friend,
[6091.42s -> 6094.70s]  Mambo, and he's a good friend of mine. I say, you get your, you lay your hands off him right now.
[6095.34s -> 6109.27s]  Get your hands off him this instant. Oh, great. Now, she's doing that move. Gotta stay very far
[6109.27s -> 6117.99s]  away from that one. Oh, look at her. She's, she's sapping the ball as hell. I say, I say, I don't
[6117.99s -> 6121.51s]  agree with that, and you're gonna make, I'm gonna get real sore with you. I'm saying right now,
[6121.51s -> 6129.78s]  I'm gonna get real cross with you. If you keep that up. Hey, you listen, Butcher. You listen here,
[6129.78s -> 6152.52s]  Jack. Here we go, Mambo. Now, I don't get that move at all. That move is absolutely unbelievable.
[6152.52s -> 6158.78s]  It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about, and as ridiculous as that,
[6158.78s -> 6172.46s]  get playing soon. They're gonna be like, I can fly eventually, too. No chance. We'll never fly.
[6172.46s -> 6177.13s]  All these people talking about getting in the air like a bird. That makes absolutely no sense to me.
[6177.93s -> 6191.46s]  Not at all. Hold talk if I've ever heard it. Satanist flying around. What are they thinking?
[6192.10s -> 6207.85s]  All right, Mambo, come on. What happened to the music? I had some good music on here,
[6207.85s -> 6212.57s]  and I don't know what happened to it. Not exactly sure. I don't know. I don't know where it went.
[6213.13s -> 6223.46s]  Excuse me for one second. Now, that's better.
[6223.46s -> 6226.58s]  Okay.
[6227.30s -> 6231.29s]  Let's get in here, and let's get, let's, let's, let's go ahead, let's stop, stop the bully.
[6235.38s -> 6244.46s]  Run away from that. Mambo behind. Come on. No, no. Not that close, Mambo, please.
[6246.94s -> 6255.54s]  Fuck, no. Excuse me. Looks like she's gonna, I say looks like she's gonna heal the whole thing now,
[6255.54s -> 6259.22s]  because she did that to Mambo.
[6275.06s -> 6280.02s]  I think this could be long here. I'm very certain this could be it. Hey, it's possible.
[6281.62s -> 6291.24s]  And then we have to break that glass immediately and try to get over there as fast as we can.
[6296.12s -> 6307.19s]  See, what you don't know is back in the 1930s, we never exhaled it. It stayed in.
[6308.55s -> 6313.29s]  Permanently. We absorbed it into our bloodstream as the second we sucked it in.
[6314.54s -> 6320.78s]  And as some facts for you. Now, come on now.
[6351.62s -> 6404.17s]  Fuck you. Seriously, that's stupid. What? How many fucking moves do you get before you?
[6404.17s -> 6408.09s]  I'm sorry about that, folks, but what I meant to say was how many moves do you get to do in a row
[6408.09s -> 6413.37s]  before, gosh darn it, you, how many moves do you get to do, gosh darn it, before fucking, wrong
[6413.37s -> 6418.17s]  thing. Wrong thing. And now the whole thing's fucked up, folks, so we may as well just do this
[6418.17s -> 6447.11s]  and say, fuck you, die. I blew the whole thing. Locked in, she sat down at my desk.
[6447.67s -> 6453.43s]  I said, lady, what are you doing in here? He gave me one look, one quick look in my eye.
[6453.99s -> 6463.96s]  And I knew, sorry, I knew right then when she came and sat out of my office, what, it was going to
[6463.96s -> 6473.35s]  be quite an evening. I knew right there that the next few days of my life were situated, they were
[6473.35s -> 6486.30s]  stuck. Gosh, I could get through this. The local paper the next day, yeah, so all the other people
[6486.30s -> 6495.42s]  that have died at this moment. So I ripped it up, and I'm fucking mad, and this is the only thing
[6495.42s -> 6501.90s]  keeping me from fucking strangling myself. Like, just strangling. So she walked in.
[6511.72s -> 6518.62s]  Can I turn it off now, please? It doesn't work. It makes everything sound horrible and it sucks.
[6519.42s -> 6539.77s]  I say, here's, okay, here we are. I'm gonna paint this piece of shit. Oh, I lost my hat.
[6540.73s -> 6549.98s]  It's the only thing that's keeping my brain in. Oh! It's okay. Everything's fine. Don't worry about
[6549.98s -> 6556.02s]  it. Everything seems to be going very smoothly, as smoothly as it could. Just don't want her to do
[6556.02s -> 6566.92s]  that to Mambo. How long is he going to keep this up? Probably until he wins. Or he runs out of mana.
[6567.80s -> 6574.54s]  This is bad. I don't fucking know.
[6575.58s -> 6579.43s]  I gotta turn this off. It's fucking with me. It's fucking with me. I gotta turn it off now.
[6587.75s -> 6593.98s]  I hate this fucking fight, and I hate this piece of shit behind this door.
[6594.62s -> 6603.40s]  Let's bring it back. 1995.
[6620.57s -> 6625.69s]  Okay, let's try this again. This time I'm gonna try. I haven't gotten her to phase two.
[6626.25s -> 6630.33s]  I can't, why can I not get this piece of fucking shit to phase?
[6633.62s -> 6637.94s]  Fuck this fight. I hope I get to cheese the fuck out of this. I hope I kill it instantly.
[6637.94s -> 6658.66s]  I hope I kill her instantly in phase two. I hope so. Get in there. Come on. Just go.
[6658.66s -> 6662.50s]  Bully, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully. It's the only fucking way to fight this.
[6674.17s -> 6679.83s]  Bully! Where's the bully? Get it. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go, back up, back up, back up.
[6679.83s -> 6703.45s]  God damn it. Everything that we just did. What a pain in the fucking ass. Keep it up. Go,
[6703.45s -> 6715.80s]  go, go, go, go, go, more, more, more, more, more, more, more. She's gonna go up. She's gonna go up.
[6715.80s -> 6728.50s]  I just know she's gonna go up like right now. She's going up. She's going up. She's going up.
[6734.36s -> 6736.52s]  When is she gonna, she's gonna go up like right now.
[6740.52s -> 6764.01s]  Is she going up? I'm so fucking paranoid. She's gonna do it, right? What is going on?
[6764.57s -> 6785.72s]  Okay, she's almost there now. Oh, fuck. This is it. This is it. All right. Fuck this fight.
[6785.72s -> 6808.10s]  Let's go. Drink? Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. I didn't drink it. What? What happened?
[6808.90s -> 6858.79s]  Why didn't I drink it? I don't care. Fuck it. We're doing it anyway. What did I drink? Talking
[6858.79s -> 6900.54s]  about, dude? What are you talking? God, this is un-fucking-bearable. This is the worst fight
[6900.54s -> 6919.70s]  they've ever made without a question. Without a solitary question. I think you can just run.
[6920.58s -> 6924.68s]  That's the one you gotta, all right. No, no, no. Okay, there's two? Two of the thrusts.
[6925.32s -> 6933.80s]  Jesus Christ. At least that's the longest I've been able to see what the fuck this piece of shit
[6933.80s -> 6948.92s]  even does. Like you're so slow, but your moves are so fucking awful. This is what happens when
[6948.92s -> 6961.78s]  you don't have 99 arcane. Okay, testing. If I sprint away, I can sprint away and it won't get me.
[6961.78s -> 6966.74s]  Oh my God. Okay. I can run away from that move. That's confirmed. That's confirmed. I can run.
[6967.46s -> 6990.81s]  I mean, at this point, I'm just. That's one, two, three. You can't dodge it. This fight sucks. See
[6990.81s -> 6995.05s]  you in two weeks when they fucking come out with patch 1.04 and they're like, well, you know, we
[6995.45s -> 7008.15s]  always, we nerfed it a little. They got a patch 1.04. The first tagline is going to be in bold.
[7009.82s -> 7012.70s]  Linear damage output and healing has been reduced by 25%.
[7013.74s -> 7028.60s]  I'm not going to waste man on the moons. I don't think they're worth it. Maybe one moon. Let's go.
[7036.15s -> 7039.43s]  I didn't, why did I not drink the flask? I literally pressed fucking swear.
[7051.83s -> 7059.46s]  That's a broken fucking move. Even if you dodge it, like even if you dodge that shit perfectly,
[7060.26s -> 7068.57s]  it doing. I have fucking 52 vigor, 53 vigor. It does my entire health bar. You have to roll in.
[7069.88s -> 7075.00s]  It's like she keeps going. This is stupid. This is fucking stupid. This is stupid.
[7075.88s -> 7083.32s]  This is stupid. Stupid. It's stupid. It's stupid. This is stupid. This is stupid.
[7083.88s -> 7088.33s]  It's stupid. This is stupid. I just want to make sure you understood.
[7089.05s -> 7120.47s]  I can hate that move too. That's awful. It's the heal shit. Just don't let the character here.
[7120.47s -> 7125.59s]  Why is the only character ever that heals? You've made fucking 200 bosses from software.
[7125.59s -> 7163.13s]  You have to have it with the heal. I got back up, back up. She's going to do it. Is she going up?
[7163.13s -> 7190.44s]  Yep. Nope. She's going up now, right? She's going up. Yes, she is. Come on.
[7190.84s -> 7237.27s]  Mababababababambo. Don't fuck it up this time. What? You motherfucker. You motherfucker.
[7239.35s -> 7280.14s]  I'm so mad. Jesus Christ, please. Drink that flesh right now. Drink it. Shoot it.
[7280.78s -> 7300.89s]  It doesn't fucking do anything. It doesn't fucking do anything. Fucking Jesus. I thought
[7300.89s -> 7312.76s]  didn't know it was going to go that far. God, worst fucking fight they've ever fucking made
[7312.76s -> 7345.67s]  in the history of all of their fucking games. I don't want the gargoyles, black blades. I'm
[7345.67s -> 7353.48s]  talking about this fucking thing. I'm going back. You want to be a broken boss? I'm going to use
[7353.48s -> 7368.14s]  the broken katana. How does that sound? Let's just go to the... Now you're fucked because now I'm
[7368.14s -> 7384.76s]  angry. Now I'm angry. I'm like... Hugh, put every ounce of your strength into this fucking thing.
[7384.76s -> 7391.27s]  Every ounce. I'm going to... Seriously, code it in everything you could... What the fuck do you have
[7391.27s -> 7396.55s]  back there? Poison, rot, blood, magic stuff. Just dump the whole thing on it. Dump everything on it.
[7398.50s -> 7425.10s]  I'll pay you extra. I don't have any runes. This sucks, man. Give me the other rune because
[7425.10s -> 7428.62s]  this rune's stupid. Everything's stupid in this game, apparently. You don't understand
[7428.62s -> 7441.88s]  everything's stupid. Seven and seven. I'll pay extra. I will pay extra. I'll pay an extra
[7441.88s -> 7449.14s]  10,000 runes. I don't care what you put in that. I want it to be able to kill her. I don't care
[7450.10s -> 7457.13s]  what it is. All right, we're putting Godric's rune on. I just better work or I'm going to be
[7457.13s -> 7463.22s]  even more mad. I'm going to... I'm going to break. I think I have to... I'm going to... What am I...
[7464.18s -> 7474.49s]  I'm so mad. I'm trying to hold it so hard. You know what I mean? I feel like I'm like...
[7477.51s -> 7481.59s]  I feel like you're holding in a fucking fart and it hurts your stomach, but you're
[7481.59s -> 7485.03s]  surrounded by people and you're like, I'm not going to just fart and ruin everybody's day.
[7485.03s -> 7488.23s]  You know what I mean? I'm holding it in right now.
[7489.82s -> 7494.54s]  It's like if you're in a room with like 10 people and like, oh my God, I got a big gas problem,
[7494.54s -> 7500.54s]  right? Like I'm not just going to fucking rip ass at like something. No, I'm holding it. I'm
[7500.54s -> 7515.42s]  holding it and I'm fucking going to go in the bathroom. It's 1800 and then probably 2000.
[7516.62s -> 7531.46s]  I can't cool down. So angry. I need to cool down. I need to cool down. I got to cool it.
[7531.46s -> 7538.14s]  Let's take a rune arc. Pretty cool. All right. Very cool.
[7539.74s -> 7553.43s]  Use the mimic tier. No, the mimic tier is the last resort. Moonvale is the beta 0.8 last resort.
[7553.43s -> 7561.56s]  I need to sell some shit. I wish I could just fucking relax. There's like a demon right now
[7561.56s -> 7566.76s]  that's like, just start screaming. That's what we want to do. Just scream. And I'm like, no,
[7566.76s -> 7576.73s]  stop, man. Relax. And he's like, no, we're going to scream in a minute. What can I get rid of?
[7579.26s -> 7591.77s]  Okay. Just, just go to the bog spot. Stupid fucking boss. You know, and the music is so good,
[7591.77s -> 7596.07s]  but it's making me hate that song. You know what I'm saying? Like when I hear that, like,
[7600.07s -> 7603.75s]  I'm just like, fucking hate this. I hate this area. You're reminding me how much I hate this.
[7615.91s -> 7623.40s]  I got the 2000 rooms. I need to shoot it at somebody. I thought I killed him.
[7624.04s -> 7635.22s]  And this thing has bleed too. Fucking baby rattle. I gotta remember how to play with this.
[7636.10s -> 7649.86s]  I feel like this is going to be even better. I feel like this is not going to even be better.
[7651.94s -> 7658.17s]  Just kill the bird. Yeah, you're right. But I gotta remember how to play with this stuff.
[7658.17s -> 7683.34s]  L1 is the sideways and R1 is the overhead. It'll be significantly better. Use the FP talisman.
[7683.34s -> 7689.02s]  Stop telling me what to do. Stop. Fine. I gotta stop like putting the fourth of the
[7689.98s -> 7695.74s]  thing where like, oh, you're the, you are the most unhinged Elden ring streamer. I have to keep that
[7695.74s -> 7699.10s]  in mind. I have to make sure I'm like somewhere like in the middle, right? Like I can't be number
[7699.10s -> 7703.34s]  one. I can't be like the guy that everybody points to like, oh yeah, go to history. He's a fucking
[7703.34s -> 7715.40s]  psycho. No, I'm fine. And I'm not going to say anything else. That's nine. Bingo. Plus 10 moon
[7715.40s -> 7744.76s]  veil. I'm ready. I am so pissed. All right. All right. All right. I'm ready to at least give this
[7744.76s -> 7768.23s]  a try. This has bleed as well. Do you know about the Wraith Bell cheese? I don't. So what, so you
[7768.23s -> 7776.47s]  saying I should just get up there and just start whacking. Just like, wham, wham, wham, wham. Is
[7776.47s -> 7789.96s]  that, is that the idea? Let's see how this works. I feel like I'm gripping the sword way harder.
[7798.79s -> 7902.34s]  Fucking hell. What a great mechanic. I'm somewhere. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Dude,
[7902.34s -> 7907.75s]  it's the camera. Okay. Like I know I'm supposed to like dodge thrower, but like the camera just
[7908.39s -> 7929.46s]  fucking fucking rips around. Walk the first flurry. You should have a do well to shield.
[7929.46s -> 7936.68s]  Mine's going to come here with two fucking shields. I just hope I win. Let me just see if I can.
[7937.64s -> 7947.94s]  There's no fucking way I'm going to be able to do a toe to toe. Not a chance of hell.
[7979.72s -> 7990.42s]  Dude, you don't stop, but you don't stop fucking attacking. She does not stop attacking. Is this
[7990.42s -> 8001.91s]  intended? This, is this intended? I feel like there's just like a bunch of zeros and ones in
[8001.91s -> 8005.19s]  the code of millennia. Like somebody just fucking put them there and like forgot to get rid of them.
[8007.11s -> 8010.22s]  I feel like there's just a bunch of zeros and ones that they just like to put there. Somebody
[8010.22s -> 8015.29s]  copying and pasting a thousand of them and they like forgot to get rid of them. Like, oh shit.
[8016.25s -> 8020.89s]  There's like all this. We got to delete that. Like this shouldn't be there. That's fucked up.
[8020.89s -> 8031.99s]  Why is it there? I don't think this is better. I don't think this is helping me out at all.
[8032.55s -> 8049.00s]  That's not doing it that much. Dude, I do that much damage with this more than that. Way more.
[8049.72s -> 8057.02s]  And it takes the same amount of time. Yeah. Like that's, this is, this is why would I, I'm not,
[8057.02s -> 8070.10s]  it's awful. Look, I look at this. That's 2000 damage if I get the frost. I don't think this
[8070.10s -> 8089.32s]  thing's worth using. I'm just kind of taking mana that I need. I'm dead. Use rivers of blood.
[8090.12s -> 8096.54s]  Bombo's not helping. Use the staff spin. You got to use it close range to hit with a sword.
[8097.34s -> 8105.27s]  You have to dodge her moves. I have a hundred hours in this game. I've beaten every single boss
[8105.27s -> 8115.29s]  except for this one and the next one. What are you talking about? I didn't run here from the first
[8115.29s -> 8154.58s]  bonfire. Damn it. It's just so hard. It's just like, she's got so many different time moves.
[8155.46s -> 8162.10s]  It's like, it's like the worst of every part of every boss game. It just really is. She's the
[8162.10s -> 8168.82s]  worst of every single encounter in Elden Ring and she heals when she fucking hits you. Are you
[8168.82s -> 8208.17s]  shitting me? Why was I crouching? Stop attacking. Just look at her health. Are you fucking kidding
[8208.17s -> 8220.71s]  me? I don't think this is supposed to be like this. This is a plus 10 fucking weapon, bro.
[8224.31s -> 8238.44s]  Why can you do this? I feel like the people are like, oh, get good. Get good. They pick up
[8238.44s -> 8243.32s]  their controller and they're here too. You're here too. You've died 200 times too. Hey, get good,
[8243.32s -> 8269.98s]  man. I haven't gotten good either. No, you get good. Why do you not attack her? There's almost
[8269.98s -> 8277.00s]  no opportunity to attack this boss. Every other boss in the whole game, even old Radan. Old Radan
[8277.00s -> 8284.17s]  pre-patch. It was like, I mean, you could at least get away. You can't get away from this motherfucker.
[8284.17s -> 8293.85s]  This motherfucker is so awful. You can't get away from this and if you get hit, she just heals back
[8293.85s -> 8306.04s]  to full fucking health. This makes old Radan look like a children's coloring book. This boss is in
[8306.04s -> 8317.10s]  the wrong game. I get it. I've never lost a battle. I'm undefeated. From software, you don't
[8317.10s -> 8323.18s]  have to make that actually real. Just put it in a fucking note somewhere. Put it in a tag.
[8323.18s -> 8327.26s]  Have a helmet you pick up. Be like, oh, by the way, Millennia was really good and she lost
[8327.26s -> 8357.05s]  not that much. Don't make it real. God, fuck. No, don't drink that potion. She's got full fucking
[8357.05s -> 8364.42s]  health again. I can't, man. I'm about to summon fucking five of you and I don't even care.
[8365.38s -> 8373.50s]  But do I really need the accolade that I lost like 15% of my hair? I don't give a shit. Who cares?
[8374.38s -> 8389.80s]  What though? I don't give a fuck. Oh, Xbox achievement. Like 25% hair loss.
[8390.28s -> 8499.64s]  Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, what the fuck? Last boss in Sekiro, I could like reliably like play against.
[8499.64s -> 8506.12s]  I think they just mashed. I think they just put every slider to 100. Just said, fuck it. Let's
[8506.12s -> 8513.24s]  just see what happens. From software, they were like, just take every single slider and just put
[8513.24s -> 8517.88s]  it to 100 and just see what happens. Just see what happens to the world. Some like world event.
[8518.84s -> 8521.96s]  Yeah, just like put it all at 100, max everything out. Who cares? And let's see
[8521.96s -> 8539.93s]  what the internet says. And oh, we're talking. They don't even give it when you drink.
[8548.71s -> 8558.84s]  Please stop doing that. He's too upset to focus. There is no focusing. Just get lucky or sit here
[8558.84s -> 8563.88s]  for 50 hours and fucking just grind this until you burn it into your fucking frontal cortex
[8563.88s -> 8575.43s]  to understand. I'm so mad. I played, I played every single boss in this whole game.
[8576.07s -> 8581.98s]  And let me tell you something. This is the worst thing they've ever done.
[8585.98s -> 8591.82s]  Even that dumb ass dragon in Dark Souls 3 was better than this. That stupid huge dragon with
[8591.82s -> 8599.42s]  500 million health was at least like, was like, okay, I just kill me fucking instantly. That
[8599.42s -> 8606.81s]  just didn't happen. No, Kos was not even close. Kos had so much, no, there was so much intel
[8606.81s -> 8614.90s]  on Kos. Kos was a walk of the park in comparison. There was so much intel on Kos. Kos took forever
[8614.90s -> 8621.75s]  to do anything. The reason why Kos was annoying was because he went with every fucking move that
[8621.75s -> 8628.07s]  he did. You could dodge Kos pretty easily with the intel. Just running in circles. Bomb up. I
[8628.07s -> 8679.61s]  thought you said dodge through the second one. Fuck you. Oh my God. Was that too far away?
[8680.25s -> 8689.99s]  I think running is just the honestly like the most reliable way. It's so hard to perfect dodge
[8690.07s -> 8748.18s]  like 16 things in a row. Gotta stem it up. Shit. Oh God, she's gonna fucking heal everything now.
[8749.46s -> 8790.82s]  Combo just to hit her. Oh shit, come on. I tried to fucking dodge through it, man. It's just so
[8790.82s -> 8854.81s]  precise. It's so awful. So awful. It's so awful. It's so awful. I'm so fucking dead. Are you?
[8874.31s -> 8978.97s]  No. Oh God, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Fuck. This is unbearable, dude.
[8980.70s -> 8988.52s]  Why am I eating the poison? Because I don't have any flasks. This is horrendous.
[8990.50s -> 8994.90s]  A poison. I don't have any flasks left. That's heals. I had to try to get at least some health.
[8995.62s -> 8998.58s]  Guys, do you think I really give a shit of my health bar going like this?
[9000.94s -> 9010.17s]  When she can take this much health in one second? Don't make fun of my fucking big
[9010.17s -> 9017.70s]  fingernails. They give me strength. Weapons dagger. You guys, okay. It's really easy to sit there and
[9017.70s -> 9023.22s]  be like, do do do do do do do do do. Do you understand that? This is the most unbearable
[9023.22s -> 9057.08s]  thing they've ever made. Ever. I'm trying. Don't you get it? Just add a fucking stamina, man.
[9057.08s -> 9063.80s]  You have to move so many times. You have to move so much more than she does. It's holy shit. I
[9063.80s -> 9068.76s]  don't fucking expect people to actually reliably do this fucking stupid ass fight. Holy fuck.
[9068.76s -> 9080.06s]  I fucking hate this game. This is a two. This fight brought this game down to a one and a half.
[9082.87s -> 9085.75s]  I don't even want this game to come free in the cereal box anymore. You understand?
[9085.75s -> 9095.46s]  That's how awful this is. This is a two. Two out of two. Two out of six. I don't even want
[9095.94s -> 9106.04s]  free in the cereal box anymore. How much? I'm trying to get her to bleed. I just want to see
[9106.04s -> 9115.43s]  what the bleed damage looks like, but it won't fucking proc. I give it a 2.6 GPA. Like, bleed.
[9115.43s -> 9119.27s]  Okay. That does a lot, but holy shit, you have to hit her so many times and she's going to get it
[9119.27s -> 9124.79s]  all back because nobody's perfect. Not you. Not even you. Stop pretending like you did this perfectly,
[9124.79s -> 9159.34s]  by the way. Nope. No way. It's close to the mimic tier. We're getting close to the mimic tier. We are.
[9161.22s -> 9169.27s]  What? Like, I'm level 145. What the fuck? How are you supposed to do this?
[9172.02s -> 9187.80s]  What the fuck are you talking about? Phase two shit, man. Like, you have to fight her.
[9187.80s -> 9191.88s]  You have to fight like three or four health bars worth if she fucking heals off of anything.
[9192.52s -> 9220.89s]  Don't get up there in fucking time. Oh my god. I wonder how many people in chat here
[9220.89s -> 9224.73s]  summoned a friend to beat this. And they're all sitting here and talking. All this
[9226.97s -> 9231.37s]  and they probably summoned three friends to beat this. And this sitting here, Pepe laughing at me,
[9231.37s -> 9234.97s]  and you fucking people here definitely summoned two of your friends.
[9236.39s -> 9240.55s]  I'm telling you. I'd love to see. I want to see your game files. Show me the game files.
[9240.55s -> 9243.43s]  Show me the game files, okay? That you beat this guy to summon.
[9244.39s -> 9256.65s]  Show me the files. I want it. I want it. Nvidia shall play of you beating this by yourself for
[9256.65s -> 9264.09s]  the first time. I want to see the documentation. I want you to use the power of friendship.
[9268.46s -> 9271.74s]  Dude, for the one person in chat here that beat this without fucking summoning people,
[9273.10s -> 9279.02s]  right now you are just like, you have huge balls. You know what I mean? That's great.
[9279.74s -> 9284.62s]  That's awesome. It must be fucking annoying, right? Like, but like, okay, some of us people here
[9284.62s -> 9296.09s]  can't do this shit. You know what I mean? And you could have that forever. You know, oh yeah,
[9296.09s -> 9301.13s]  millennia. That's like wicked fucking hard, kid. But I mean, I beat it like on my fourth try.
[9301.13s -> 9305.53s]  It's like, okay, dude, cool. That's awesome, man. But like, you must be, you are an alien.
[9305.53s -> 9311.27s]  You're a fucking alien from outer space. You're an alien. You were dropped off here in spaceship
[9311.27s -> 9339.34s]  and you have like a 10% higher intelligence than everybody else on earth. Use millennia's
[9339.34s -> 9348.78s]  shackle. That item doesn't exist. We're going to relax. I mean, I got it a halfway at phase two
[9348.78s -> 9354.14s]  before. Let's just do what we were doing before. The reliable thing we were doing.
[9355.72s -> 9362.54s]  Getting better. Getting better. Kind of listening to these negative Andes in the chat that are
[9362.54s -> 9368.57s]  telling me that I'm, that I can't do it. None of these negative Andes are going to get me,
[9368.57s -> 9389.08s]  get me down. All right. Is there a shield that blocks anything? I'm going to put a shield on.
[9389.80s -> 9394.25s]  I'm going to put a huge fucking shield on. I'm going to put a giant, what's the biggest shield
[9394.25s -> 9398.01s]  in the game? And I'm just going to just put it on and hold it with two hands. It's my favorite
[9398.01s -> 9423.77s]  kind of dessert. Tiramisu. Can't hold any of these. These are a hundred physical though.
[9424.49s -> 9438.95s]  Okay, here we go. Does it matter if it's on, how do I block? Why can't I fucking block like this?
[9438.95s -> 9455.03s]  God damn it. I thought, just fucking killed me already. We just find like a glitch or something.
[9455.03s -> 9456.87s]  I'm going to find, I'm going to get stuck in the wall and it's going to fucking kill her.
[9456.87s -> 9475.90s]  She's going to go like walk through and die. Let me find some scrap. I'm going to clip into the
[9475.90s -> 9497.51s]  fucking wall and she's going to follow me and die. I got to fix this like, just can't wait.
[9498.87s -> 9503.46s]  I love what takes you forever to kill me when I'm just standing around.
[9511.30s -> 9545.40s]  Use the lie down emote. Try to parry her. Don't drink a potion, you idiot. You idiot. I need to
[9545.40s -> 9550.94s]  see, we're going to, this is weird testing. We're just, I want to test and see if I can eat that
[9550.94s -> 9577.14s]  whole whirlwind move, whatever it is. Oh, damn it, man. I hate this.
[9578.66s -> 9585.34s]  This is the most I've ever struggled on from software was I'm telling you without a doubt,
[9585.98s -> 9591.66s]  like not even nothing comes close. And I have 5,000 hours in all the from software games. And let
[9591.66s -> 9596.46s]  me tell you something Reddit, right? Like, yeah, I know I've seen it. I've seen, I've heard about it.
[9597.34s -> 9606.76s]  I just want to see if I can block this. This is just a wash. This is a test.
[9607.32s -> 9623.42s]  Just do it so I can just see if this is worth doing. Go up and please,
[9651.74s -> 9655.42s]  please just let me see if I can block the move. Why won't you fucking do it?
[9661.43s -> 9674.58s]  Go in the air. Six mana flasks. I didn't, I, dude, we've been trying so many strategies to beat this
[9674.58s -> 9681.08s]  stupid ass boss. Am I actually going to be one of these streamers that sits here for like 10
[9681.08s -> 9688.26s]  fucking hours to do this? Like, oh, I took me eight hours of two straight streams to beat her.
[9689.22s -> 9707.38s]  Go in the fucking air. Okay, you can block the first one. Who cares? It doesn't matter. You're
[9707.38s -> 9733.70s]  going to get by the next two. Do the power stands on the Katana. What about Blackknife,
[9733.70s -> 9740.23s]  Teesh? Do I have enough, uh, whatever they are? Do I have enough warts for that?
[9740.79s -> 9758.70s]  Summon your friend. Is Teesh actually good here? He says so much. Just so much.
[9759.98s -> 9771.24s]  Blackknife, Teesh will help a ton. I gotta do something, but it can't be the Mimic tier yet.
[9771.24s -> 9776.68s]  The Mimic tier is like, I'm going to like turn on the game show. I don't want to do that yet,
[9776.68s -> 9824.87s]  but trust me when I say I'm, I'm willing to. Oh, stop this bullshit. I didn't want to drink that.
[9824.87s -> 9851.34s]  I'm okay. Can't see anything. Oh, come on. You're doing it again. I can't hold it. I can't hold it.
[9851.34s -> 9877.96s]  I can't hold it. I can't block you when she does that. Oh, I'm trying to parry.
[9890.15s -> 9895.83s]  The end of this video is going to be opening up the trash can and dropping the Elden Ring disc
[9895.83s -> 9931.48s]  case into the trash. Boom. Plus like for more. Look at this fucking thing. Things are plus seven,
[9931.48s -> 9952.28s]  dude. All right. I'm going to try this one more. Where's Teesh? I don't think I do. I don't even
[9952.28s -> 9980.47s]  have Teesh. I don't have it. The jail. Oh, it's a jail. All right. Let's go do it. I'm fucking
[9980.47s -> 9987.67s]  putting up with this anymore. I don't care. I'm not doing it. I don't care. Whatever. I,
[9987.67s -> 9994.23s]  I, I'll, I'll summon Teesh and win. I don't give a shit. Who cares? It's just pixels on the screen.
[9994.23s -> 9997.43s]  You know what I mean? It's just like pixels that have been mushed together to look like an image.
[9997.99s -> 10024.94s]  Well, I don't care. Where? An area. This one here. Is that it? No. Is that one? No. Is it right here?
[10025.42s -> 10064.06s]  This one? Southwest. Right here? Okay. Right here. All right. We need to go to one. Let's go. Oh my
[10064.06s -> 10068.12s]  God. He's going to use Teesh. You know, for the last couple of days, I was thinking like, oh fuck,
[10068.12s -> 10072.04s]  maybe I'm going to try to beat this. I beat like the last boss in Sekiro and like I streamed it
[10072.04s -> 10076.66s]  and I didn't like get like help or anything. And I did it after seeing this for the last,
[10076.66s -> 10083.42s]  the last like four hours or so game wise. No, I don't fucking care. If I could summon a giant
[10083.42s -> 10089.90s]  omega lull that just came and just bit her head off and just killed her instantly, I would do it
[10089.90s -> 10092.94s]  and like everyone would be like, oh my God, he used the giant omega lull. And I'd be like,
[10092.94s -> 10110.39s]  I don't care. Yeah, I did. Good. Okay. I don't care. That was supposed to be so angry. Use the
[10110.39s -> 10133.56s]  mimic tear. The mimic tear is worse than the omega lull. You'd puke. Mimic tear is not an
[10133.56s -> 10136.81s]  instrument. I know I'm just kidding around. All right. Where are you? Let's go.
[10147.43s -> 10259.90s]  What's that? Oh, that's slow. Hey, shit. What killed me? What happened? What happened? What
[10259.90s -> 10268.52s]  happened? What happened? There's a dot. Oh, fuck it. I thought it was just like magical juice.
[10268.52s -> 10295.51s]  I didn't think it was a dot. This is hard too. This thing is in Lunaria. Holy shit, dude.
[10296.63s -> 10383.99s]  You can jump over it. Maybe not. That hurts a lot. Whoa. Got caught. Drink. Why the fuck
[10384.39s -> 10435.72s]  the input bullshit? 80,000 souls. Holy shit. Okay. You got the omega lull spell. How dare you?
[10437.10s -> 10463.56s]  What's wrong with you? Okay. Why don't you use common Azure? Common Azure does not hurt her really
[10463.56s -> 10471.56s]  at all. I did it on the phase two transition and it was like, I held it on there for five full
[10471.56s -> 10491.42s]  seconds and it was not worth doing. Okay. Where are you? Black knife teach. I can buy those.
[10492.06s -> 10517.53s]  You should do rivers of blood while you're here. Are there any more? Yeah. I need ghost glove
[10517.53s -> 10535.75s]  ward five. Hey, do I need six, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Let's go. Not the right build for rivers
[10535.75s -> 10547.06s]  of blood. You got to respect. It won't work on an in-build. Let's give this another like hour.
[10547.06s -> 10553.51s]  We got teach. I've heard this is the omega lull bite millennials head off person. We're going to
[10553.51s -> 10570.41s]  do it. Arcane index, but that's like the whole, another character. I have a plus 10 teach. I'm
[10570.41s -> 10592.95s]  ready to fuck around. I'm ready to fuck somebody up. 132, man. Holy shit. All right. Bombo actually
[10592.95s -> 10598.50s]  was really good. Everybody loves Bombo. How could you not? I'm sorry. I have to put game genie in
[10598.50s -> 10622.66s]  mumbo. Okay. Let's see what happens here. Disrespecting best girl with cheese. Andy's
[10622.66s -> 10641.51s]  grass shaking my head. I don't care. All right. Get her. Let's just kill her. Holy shit. That was
[10641.51s -> 10662.36s]  insane. Oh, what was that heal? Oh my God. Teach. Why are you healing so much more? All right. You're
[10662.36s -> 10668.02s]  going to die on you now. I'm just, that should never do that much damage. I don't care how strong
[10668.02s -> 10675.64s]  the boss is. That's fucked up, man. Don't you think that's fucked up? You did one slash and it's
[10675.64s -> 10709.27s]  just a good 90% of my health. Come on, Gary. Cheese Andy. Oh, correct. I'm back. I'm already a G.
[10712.66s -> 10751.48s]  How did you miss that? God, you should never do that much damage. Oh, it's that cheesy Reedy
[10751.48s -> 10776.84s]  Brody. I hate this fight. I just want to get, I just want to get out of this fight. You know
[10776.84s -> 10782.04s]  what I mean? Like I just, I'm going to go to my game files and just where it says millennia dead
[10782.76s -> 10790.84s]  dash space exclamation point quotes, true quotes and bracket. You know what I mean? Like I was
[10790.84s -> 10831.45s]  going to put it in there. No, not mumbo. Fuck. Mumbo prove everybody wrong. Juice? What? How am I
[10831.45s -> 10902.57s]  out of juice already? She's just farming. Like she's being farmed. Oh shit. I just, I just can't,
[10902.57s -> 10946.31s]  man. I'm just so done with this bullshit. I need you to. Oh, fuck off with that from software.
[10946.31s -> 10962.63s]  What is with this code? Oh my God. You got to be fucking kidding me, dude. I can't fucking believe
[10962.63s -> 10969.99s]  that move. Like you guys put a training dummy on the ground that just like absorbs threat.
[10974.49s -> 10983.62s]  All that work gone in one move. Isn't it, isn't it fun? Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it fun for you to
[10983.62s -> 10993.56s]  spend all this time fighting this fucking goddamn motherfucker down here is all wiped away. She has
[10993.56s -> 11005.43s]  the stupidest move ever across every single video game. Every single one, every single video
[11005.43s -> 11033.98s]  game. And I'm even talking about the holy hand grenade from fucking worms. Armageddon. Oh,
[11033.98s -> 11045.42s]  you should have gotten staggered. It's so hard. Do you understand how hard it is to dodge that?
[11045.42s -> 11052.46s]  Because when you dodge, the camera fucking goes crazy. Sometimes you dodge like the wrong way
[11052.46s -> 11071.94s]  because she moves so quickly. I'm not going over there. Fuck that. Oh, I can't. I got no fucking.
[11077.69s -> 11087.42s]  I actually can't believe that's in the game. I was out of stamina. I couldn't run. I couldn't run.
[11087.42s -> 11108.07s]  I was too busy playing the game right now. Like the from software devs are watching the stream.
[11108.07s -> 11114.30s]  They're watching the stream right now and they're going like, oh, here it goes again.
[11114.30s -> 11118.30s]  Oh, that move that we turned up to a hundred and fucking a hundred times to just watch, watch,
[11118.30s -> 11152.17s]  watch him. Watch him. He's going to lose again. Yeah. Idiot, idiot, idiot. God,
[11152.17s -> 11170.54s]  he just never prepared for it. Oh my God. Oh, what the fuck was that? What just happened?
[11171.34s -> 11174.22s]  He just like did a full one hundred and three hundred and eighty. He just fucking did a 360
[11174.22s -> 11197.32s]  return. Fucking run. Just run away. Look at her health again. The healing is fucking stupid.
[11197.32s -> 11201.48s]  What is the, what's the, what's the fucking magical lore reason for her heal?
[11202.44s -> 11247.38s]  Oh, let's go read the description. Am I in the rot? Fuck you. I am.
[11248.42s -> 11259.35s]  Okay. Let's go. Fuck it. Just do it. Do it. No. Oh my God. Please don't do it.
[11266.06s -> 11269.58s]  Get away from me. Please teach me something. Please do something.
[11273.59s -> 11283.82s]  I fucking ran out of stamina, man. I have no stamina. I have no stamina. Oh my God.
[11284.62s -> 11299.96s]  Oh my fucking God, dude. How the fuck are you supposed to do this at a second phase?
[11300.92s -> 11305.96s]  She's got full health. I've got, I've got, I can't, the stamina kicked down. I can't even attack her.
[11306.60s -> 11309.80s]  I can't even, she's going to kill me. She's going to sneeze in one direction. I'm going to die.
[11310.36s -> 11324.98s]  This sucks. I'm dead. I'm just fucking screwed. Oh, okay. She shouldn't be able to heal in phase
[11324.98s -> 11337.77s]  two, right? That's not fair. Relocate flasks. How many health flasks? I don't know, man. This
[11337.77s -> 11347.96s]  seems like fucking crazy. Maybe like nine. How about the boys? The boys are going to fill her
[11347.96s -> 11356.58s]  health bar five times. What about your armor? I feel like I'm wearing some of the best armor in
[11356.58s -> 11368.73s]  the game. You need to cheese harder. How, how? Where's the other, where's the ultimate cheese move?
[11371.53s -> 11381.38s]  Just summon people and spam moons. All the people saying get good. I'd like, I want to see your
[11381.38s -> 11389.13s]  fucking clocked game time on this fight. And no, I'm sorry. If you came in here at soul level 500,
[11389.13s -> 11431.83s]  that's not what I'm talking about. Why does dude twice the fucking like delayed input shit?
[11432.47s -> 11436.52s]  I don't want to fucking do that. I want to, I don't want to do, I didn't want to do that move again.
[11437.48s -> 11455.62s]  Teach us under ones, please. Oh my God. This is it. This is the one. This is the one. This is the
[11455.62s -> 11500.94s]  one he's just got full fucking health boys and girls. Oh, fuck. No way. That's so insane.
[11501.66s -> 11513.93s]  That's just like, what the fuck are you supposed to do? If you, okay. I understand. Just run,
[11513.93s -> 11523.11s]  but just run, bro. Run. What if you're already there? Like when you, if you're already there,
[11523.27s -> 11528.50s]  if she goes in the air like that, it's like, you're fucked. The timings, it's like one, two,
[11529.14s -> 11540.65s]  three, four, five, six. It's just like, holy shit in my face. Get the bloodhound step.
[11541.29s -> 11545.13s]  Do I have to seriously just go get every overpowered fucking move in the whole game
[11545.13s -> 11552.38s]  to beat a boss in the whole? Just give yourself an arm cannon, a mega man legends, fucking eyepiece.
[11554.26s -> 11559.46s]  By the way, go get like the, the promoted, like captain Morgan fucking handle of alcohol.
[11559.46s -> 11572.66s]  You drink that. Well, you shouldn't have to do all that shit. The fucking moon,
[11572.66s -> 11586.14s]  it's right in front of you. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Just, I don't, just kill me. I don't
[11586.14s -> 11597.26s]  even care. Tisha's player one. Good. Good. I hope you do. I hope you beat it Tisha. Please beat the
[11597.26s -> 11600.78s]  game for me. Just beat it for me. I don't want to suck. Cause if I don't, if I summon somebody,
[11600.78s -> 11605.26s]  that's extra embarrassing, right? Quote, end quotes. It's extra, you can't summon somebody,
[11605.66s -> 11612.70s]  it's embarrassing. You beat Sekiro last boss first try. Oh, we like to jump.
[11621.13s -> 11624.73s]  That's impossible. That's impossible to do that reliably. You can't do that reliably. It's
[11624.73s -> 11629.80s]  impossible. I just only did that because I turned into Tigger. That's the only reason why I did that.
[11630.44s -> 11661.38s]  Okay. This is stupid, but it's going to work. This is really stupid. This is stupid. Turn around,
[11661.38s -> 11712.84s]  Tisha. It's impossible, man. They come up at such weird timings and they go across the whole game.
[11712.84s -> 11719.40s]  It's like, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, stab, stab, stab. It's like, you gotta fuck. Are you supposed
[11719.40s -> 11727.61s]  to do this? This, the tuning on this fight is like, holy fuck, they broke off the volume. All they
[11727.61s -> 11739.70s]  broke, at least this goes to 11. It goes to 11. It goes to 11. Roll to the right. Dude, what do you
[11739.70s -> 11751.85s]  think I was doing? Are you shitting me? I was, what the fuck? Just dodge. Oh, I can't even fucking
[11752.25s -> 11760.57s]  take it seriously anymore. I got missed the move. Oh, whatever. Oopsie daisy. Oh, the brilliant minds
[11760.57s -> 11766.97s]  that brought you fucking Sekiro and dark souls. Comes the ever, the fight of a lifetime.
[11767.77s -> 11775.03s]  Melania, some call it, she's never lost. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I have no insults. I'm just angry.
[11778.26s -> 11782.02s]  I could have, I was going to just go off, but like, you know what? No, I'm not going to,
[11782.02s -> 11786.34s]  I'm not going to go off. I'm not going to be the guy that everybody points to as the streamer that
[11786.34s -> 11790.82s]  looks like a fucking weirdo. I'm just going to play and I'm going to dodge this perfectly once.
[11791.38s -> 11802.63s]  Now I get that input. Dodge one second later. I can play it on an Xbox 360 sometimes. Like,
[11802.63s -> 11821.70s]  the input lag is like a full second sometimes. Don't let her do any moves. Either she goes in
[11821.70s -> 11879.03s]  the air killer. Do it quick before she gets this. The game hit her. Didn't that look like her back
[11879.03s -> 11899.21s]  was turned? No, I need that person to fight for the rest of the game. What the, what is that?
[11929.62s -> 11931.46s]  I thought she was doing the other one.
[11937.22s -> 11942.26s]  I thought she was doing a move guys. I thought she was doing another move. I thought that was
[11942.26s -> 11949.86s]  the big sweeping one. Oh my God. Fuck this fight. Fuck this game. Return it. I don't have a hundred
[11949.86s -> 11953.94s]  hours in it, but I'm returning it. I'm going up to the counter with these eyes like this. The
[11953.94s -> 11958.26s]  fucking GameStop that I got this piece of shit from. I'm going to be like, hey, yeah, I would
[11958.26s -> 11964.12s]  like to make a, I'd like to make a return please. Oh yeah. You want to make a return? Yeah. It's
[11964.12s -> 11970.36s]  been, uh, I know that like your policy is seven days. Uh, it's been 38, but I want a refund. No,
[11970.36s -> 11974.84s]  this is the way you suck. And you're gay. Your game sucks. It's like the guys at GameStop had
[11974.84s -> 12170.10s]  nothing to do with this game. Come on. No, no. I don't know where you are.
[12220.55s -> 12278.31s]  Fuck what happened? Why did she not move? That was weird. No, she had to fucking do that move
[12278.31s -> 12287.53s]  right there. Oh my God. She had to do that right there. You see what I mean?
[12287.53s -> 12291.61s]  It's like, if you're, if you're within like five to 10 feet of her, you're just fucked.
[12294.68s -> 12308.52s]  Oh, why? Oh, why? Why? The scarlet rot killed me, but fuck man. This sucks such a dick.
[12308.52s -> 12343.42s]  That sucks. I can't believe she did that fucking move of all the things. It's just like, come the
[12343.42s -> 12352.26s]  fuck on. And I was so, I was right next to her too. That's the worst part. Oh, you pain in the ass.
[12353.30s -> 12368.86s]  I can't believe that fucking move is in there. Like that move existing just fucking ruins the
[12368.86s -> 12376.50s]  fight sometimes. Like it just does. It just ruins the fight. That fucking move existing,
[12376.50s -> 12381.54s]  just throws, it fucking just shreds her and throws the whole run into the air.
[12382.58s -> 12395.40s]  That's what makes the fight fun. I don't like going to the dentist, do you? The dentist sucks.
[12395.40s -> 12400.18s]  The dentist is not fun. You don't go to the dentist chair and go like, yeah, I'm ready.
[12400.18s -> 12417.27s]  I can't wait for you to drill in. I'm not going to say it. I was so fucking close. It was one
[12417.27s -> 12424.15s]  fucking hit away, but she healed off of the stupid dance thing that she does. She healed like 20% of
[12424.15s -> 12434.54s]  her fucking health pool off of the summon. This sucks. I can't wait to be done with this. I'm
[12434.54s -> 12438.14s]  going to do it and I can't, I'm fucking, I'm not doing this on Me Strong. Me Strong is just going
[12438.14s -> 12442.78s]  to get high and fucking enjoy his life. He's not coming in here. I don't give a shit about secret
[12442.86s -> 12448.78s]  fucking ending. Me Strong is going to just suck a fucking ball. He's going to just,
[12448.78s -> 12453.66s]  whatever is the term that the fucking kids use. He's coming in here and he's literally
[12453.66s -> 12458.46s]  not coming in this door. I don't give a shit how cool this is. No, and it's not even cool.
[12459.02s -> 12463.18s]  It's not even that cool. This fight's not cool. Me Strong is going to get wicked high and he's
[12463.18s -> 12476.01s]  going to walk around limb graved. That's it. I'm looking forward to that. I'm just looking
[12476.01s -> 12479.53s]  forward to like going to limb grave and like fucking just like spelling the ocean and shit.
[12479.53s -> 12497.78s]  I don't want to be here. My God, you fucking seriously. God damn it, man. I'm trying not
[12497.78s -> 12504.18s]  to lock on that move. It breaks this whole encounter. It's a broken fucking move. It is
[12504.74s -> 12510.18s]  broken. It's a, it's broken. It needs to be corrected. They need to get in there and they
[12510.18s -> 12515.70s]  need to correct the mistake. It is a mistake. It is a mistake. Why are there so many people here?
[12516.58s -> 12534.20s]  I need to relax. It's like people like telling them fucking threads and shit.
[12535.32s -> 12539.96s]  Don't tell people to come here. Don't tell people to come here. Why? No, I don't have
[12539.96s -> 12546.49s]  access to teach. I fucking hate this. You gotta be fucking kidding me. I'm doing it. I'm doing it
[12546.49s -> 12560.62s]  with my original friend. I'm fucking furious right now. What is happening? Do the magic move. Do the
[12560.62s -> 12592.04s]  magic move. It's a glowing shit that she has all over. What's going on there? Why would I attack
[12592.04s -> 12607.86s]  Mambo? What was the point of that? I ran out of fucking stamina. I'm going to go put 50 endurance
[12607.86s -> 12613.53s]  in after this. I'm going to put 50 endurance in it. Then it's 70 intelligence and that's it.
[12627.29s -> 12628.25s]  And here comes the fucking
[12628.25s -> 12652.14s]  This piece of fucking garbage needed one hit. You had to do that move out of every move.
[12652.14s -> 12659.50s]  You were dead in one swing but you are so unbearable that like the the player base
[12659.50s -> 12668.20s]  does not even want to fight. They are afraid to engage because a few of the moves are disengageable.
[12668.20s -> 12675.85s]  Like that you just disengage the whole fight. Nobody wants to fight you. You're just annoying.
[12675.85s -> 12681.34s]  You're an annoying piece of shit. I'm taking one of these right now. I'm taking these fucking
[12681.34s -> 12693.56s]  ruined drugs right now. No, I'm not. So watch. Take one now. Quick. The only reason why everybody
[12693.56s -> 12699.64s]  fucking does this fight is so they can. It's a vicious cycle. I need to beat this because
[12699.64s -> 12703.32s]  everyone's gonna make fun of me if I don't. Everybody, all your like discord groups and
[12703.32s -> 12707.16s]  all your friend groups and shit. All you guys are sitting around going like fuck I have to beat her.
[12707.16s -> 12710.84s]  Otherwise like I'm gonna be the one person in the fucking friend group that doesn't beat her.
[12710.84s -> 12729.21s]  And like everyone's gonna make fun of me. It's a social experiment. Fucking social experiment.
[12730.50s -> 12735.62s]  It's a fucking from software. It's a from software like social mind experiment.
[12736.34s -> 12741.82s]  There were like government officials just sitting there with clipboards watching me right now.
[12742.38s -> 12752.15s]  And they're taking notes about my fucking behavior. They've got like microscopes.
[12752.87s -> 12756.55s]  Somebody's watching like this part of my face right here under a microscope.
[12757.03s -> 12770.76s]  This goddamn door and fuck this area. Can I change? Can I change? Let me ask you guys a question.
[12770.76s -> 12776.84s]  Can I change my ending? Can I burn this fucking tree to the ground? Can I go get an extinguisher
[12776.84s -> 12781.56s]  and can I go put out the urtree and can I torch this fucking goddamn tree right now?
[12781.56s -> 12788.70s]  Can I burn this tree? Tell me that I if I can I want to. I want to burn this this fucking tree.
[12788.70s -> 12812.90s]  I want to burn this place. I'm gonna go back to the urtree. Did my spell even land?
[12828.07s -> 12833.56s]  They have to fix this. Can you imagine somebody that doesn't really play from software games
[12833.56s -> 12843.88s]  walking in here? From software is going to send millions of people to church.
[12844.76s -> 12848.76s]  Like you're gonna you're gonna like make people go like ask god for fucking help here.
[12849.40s -> 12857.26s]  I want to see the uptick in like new religion applications after this game came out. I want
[12857.26s -> 12859.90s]  to see how many people like went to fucking church. Like went to like their local church
[12859.90s -> 12897.02s]  and was like you know what I'm gonna try. Yeah yeah bullshit. I knew you were gonna do that dumb
[12897.02s -> 12945.51s]  move. That's the meaning of this. I didn't I I did not press R2 a second time. I did not press R2
[12945.51s -> 12953.64s]  a second time. Why did it queue up another fucking R2? Why? I swear to god dude sometimes like if
[12953.64s -> 12959.08s]  you press a button in this game and you're in mid animation the fact that it like does that right
[12959.08s -> 12971.37s]  after. I want to check checkbox to make that fucking not happen. I want like a dozen checkboxes
[12971.37s -> 12974.33s]  for these quality of life things. Just fuck you.
[12978.52s -> 13024.23s]  Healing it again. All that fucking free health from that. You don't want. Okay it's it's like
[13024.23s -> 13028.79s]  seriously I feel like a speed runner. Like if she does that to the summons just start the whole
[13028.79s -> 13033.35s]  thing over. You don't want her to do that move to the summon. She regains like 30 40 percent her
[13033.35s -> 13062.89s]  health back. Just kill me. It's like shit. It's like I've had to kill her like fucking three
[13062.89s -> 13092.68s]  times already. Fuck you. God damn it man. Look at Tisha's health. It's just throw just throw dice
[13092.68s -> 13097.64s]  in the air. That's what this whole fucking fight is. Just throw a hundred fucking dice
[13097.64s -> 13160.07s]  into the air. Did you get 10 sixes? Okay good. Congratulations. What? I fucking dodged. Oh fuck.
[13161.96s -> 13168.60s]  No. Get away from me. I was so like intensely paying attention to all the fucking moves she
[13168.60s -> 13198.26s]  was doing that I fucking wasn't ready for that shit. Oh my god. I don't fucking even know where
[13198.26s -> 13222.50s]  the camera is. Oh my god. No I almost I needed one more hit to kill her which means I can do it.
[13222.50s -> 13233.98s]  Oh I still got one of the words are like fucking right here and I want to just spew them out.
[13233.98s -> 13241.90s]  Oh I want it like I want to say shit. You have no idea. It's taking it's taking like like stone
[13241.90s -> 13249.50s]  level concentration. Like I'm a goddamn stone. Not like spew out just this just just talking shit.
[13249.50s -> 13271.99s]  You know I'm watching so bad. I gotta I gotta bring myself down. What you're about to hear
[13271.99s -> 13281.34s]  is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you. Acknowledging you for a variety of
[13281.34s -> 13288.60s]  reasons. Because there's a situation that does not apply to you. Just listen.
[13289.40s -> 13315.24s]  So sit back. Get ready. Here it comes. We want to thank you for all your hard work. You're the one
[13315.24s -> 13325.74s]  who steps up and gets things done around here. You keep your word what you promise and then you
[13325.74s -> 13347.02s]  go the extra mile. Job. Job. As Bill Tellum. Job.
[13349.58s -> 13413.14s]  You're probably wondering why we have asked you here today. We want to tell you that we have faith
[13414.18s -> 13424.20s]  and we know you can do it. We know you've got everything it takes to accomplish whatever your
[13424.28s -> 13436.28s]  heart desires. The dream mission you're seeking. I bet it is yours.
[13440.47s -> 13450.70s]  Just listen. Everyone agrees. Your side. We're here for you.
[13464.36s -> 13475.46s]  Why? She had no health. What the fuck? You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[13480.20s -> 13485.88s]  I had to heal. I had scarlet rot. All it took was one fucking, if she had hit me with one move.
[13487.82s -> 13495.66s]  Oh my god. This is the worst thing in any video game that's ever come out. Without a doubt it
[13495.66s -> 13503.66s]  sucks. This is pure pain. It's just misery. This is miserable. Miyazaki, look what you're doing to
[13503.66s -> 13510.46s]  us. Why are you doing this to us Miyazaki? Please let me out. Let me out of here Miyazaki. I don't
[13510.46s -> 13531.75s]  want to do it anymore. I don't get it and I don't think I ever fucking will. Is there any rhyme or
[13531.75s -> 13539.70s]  reason how to dodge that reliably? I feel like it's fucking impossible. The hitbox is fucking
[13539.70s -> 13547.54s]  gigantic. And then she comes at you so fast. Like fuck that move. It's fucking terrible. It's stupid.
[13548.50s -> 13558.10s]  I can understand it twice. The third fucking time. Bro, fuck you. And fuck the horse you rode in on.
[13559.22s -> 13566.63s]  Fuck you and the horse you rode in on. Did I put the black and white filter back on?
[13567.59s -> 13574.68s]  Get her. And this time we're not fucking around. Put it back on. Cheers to you quick.
[13575.48s -> 13621.29s]  We believe in you. Dude, I don't get it. I don't understand. It's impossible. What the fuck? You
[13621.29s -> 13640.65s]  just dodge. It's not possible, dude. She goes fucking crazy. What the fuck? You have to run?
[13640.65s -> 13646.81s]  That's what I'm saying. Okay, how am I supposed to close gaps with having this permanent
[13646.89s -> 13653.61s]  terrification of like this piece of shit is just going to go in the air and just Tasmanian devil
[13653.61s -> 13664.54s]  across the whole game for fucking a full 10 seconds. What a stupid fucking boss. Did anybody
[13664.54s -> 13674.46s]  play test this? What was the game about to release? My fucking hand. That fucking hurt a lot.
[13675.10s -> 13690.76s]  Oh, fingers. Okay. My fingers. All right. That hurt a lot. That fucking hurt. They were probably
[13690.76s -> 13694.84s]  up against the fucking release. Miyazaki is like, I don't I don't know, man. Just fucking release
[13694.84s -> 13722.46s]  it. We'll fix it in a patch. It's like fucking six months later. You know what I mean? Like,
[13722.46s -> 13730.92s]  I'm just you're fucked. You are fucked. If you are fighting this boss, right, you're like,
[13731.08s -> 13737.08s]  let's go let's go this fucking educationally, right? If I'm supposed to fucking attack the boss,
[13739.83s -> 13745.03s]  if I'm attacking the boss, and she just starts Tasmanian deviling homing you across every
[13745.83s -> 13750.44s]  you need to run away from her first two, that's dude, but that's what I'm saying.
[13751.16s -> 13756.92s]  If you're if you're like, attacking the boss, and this and all of a sudden, like, okay, here we go.
[13756.92s -> 13765.69s]  Here she goes. You're it's too late. It's already too late. It's already too late. Unlock the cam.
[13765.69s -> 13769.21s]  Last time I did that, I dodged through the first one and I didn't know what the fuck she was.
[13771.88s -> 13783.66s]  Holy shit, man. I can't believe she she was dead. I got her down to one centimeter phase two,
[13783.66s -> 13787.18s]  three times now. Oh my god, this is the worst fucking thing I've ever played.
[13789.08s -> 13793.08s]  Oh my god. And everybody's saying that. Don't you when everybody says the same thing. Don't
[13793.08s -> 13797.80s]  we all agree that it's true? When everybody's saying, oh, yeah, this is the fucking shittiest
[13797.80s -> 13806.68s]  thing I've ever done in a video game. It's not accurate. 99.9999.9% of people. That's so many
[13806.68s -> 13814.63s]  people. I feel like I'm fucking like a radio host. Spider-Man and when we get those photos of
[13814.63s -> 13819.99s]  Spider-Man at 99.9999% of people hate Spider-Man. And that's why I think that they should nerf
[13819.99s -> 13842.14s]  Spider-Man like I'm turning the J Jonah fucking Jameson. I knew that sucks. Look at the health
[13842.14s -> 13846.30s]  teach his health now. It's just like, fuck you. Now teach is going to be dead in phase two and
[13846.30s -> 13880.66s]  I'm going to have to fuck around on my own. I ran and I still get hit by the second she went
[13880.66s -> 13917.40s]  near I fucking ran away. It's still hit me. I still got fucking hit by it. God fuck you.
[13917.40s -> 13938.84s]  Worst goddamn boss. Please don't. Please just fucking get hit one more time. And I'm such a
[13938.84s -> 13948.47s]  bad fucking position. You guys wanted me to make my tier list. Put this boss at the very bottom.
[13949.27s -> 13956.47s]  Like F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F, F tier. I mean like F like I want it deleted from the game.
[13956.47s -> 13963.61s]  F tier. Like F. Worst, worst ever. And put Horror Lou up at S because that was fun. This sucks.
[13963.61s -> 13967.53s]  Horror Lou is a fun fight. Horror Lou is the best, one of the best fights I think I've done in the
[13967.53s -> 14131.48s]  whole game so far. F. You got an F. You got an F. Oh my God. It's so fucking slow. Oh my God.
[14131.48s -> 14135.24s]  Eat the poison thing. Eat the poison. Eat the poison. Eat the poison. Eat the poison.
[14136.12s -> 14160.34s]  What the fuck. What. What. Hit me. It went that far. It went that fucking far. And the rot dude.
[14169.54s -> 14186.66s]  Use Comet. Dude Comet sucks dick here. Sucks dick. Quiet. Don't stand in the floor.
[14187.46s -> 14194.50s]  We got all these game expert Andys. Game. We got these expert Andys. Okay,
[14194.50s -> 14204.20s]  I appreciate all the help everybody. I really do. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I like everyone's
[14204.20s -> 14210.22s]  trying to help. I brought her down to one fucking hit remaining and she does something stupid
[14210.78s -> 14218.70s]  that covers the whole fucking game world. I've done it like four times now. And it's just trying
[14218.70s -> 14225.96s]  to get even remotely close. It's just so painful. The game just doesn't want you to fight the boss.
[14227.06s -> 14231.70s]  The game is telling you to fight these bosses. They don't want you to fight this one.
[14231.70s -> 14241.83s]  They want you to run across the fucking game. I don't want it to turn and run. Run. Run. Run.
[14242.03s -> 14251.27s]  Okay. Now, oh, here we go. Another run, run, run. Run. Run. Play touch your shit before you put it live.
[14260.30s -> 14266.33s]  So our place checking out what happened with our place.
[14267.05s -> 14275.22s]  Just run from the bomb attack. Have you played this game? I don't think you've
[14275.22s -> 14278.26s]  played. I don't think I don't think that I don't think that person's played the game.
[14278.26s -> 14294.01s]  It's so fucking stupid for what for me to lose hair who cares
[14294.81s -> 14304.72s]  But German go get the one fucking move ability. You have to get to fight this boss to make it better
[14305.16s -> 14308.32s]  You shouldn't have to make do 99 arcane to fight this boss
[14308.84s -> 14311.68s]  No other boss in the whole game has been like this is the only one
[14311.92s -> 14315.14s]  It's the only boss of the whole game that has been like oh dude
[14315.14s -> 14320.26s]  What you gotta do is you got a respected 99 arcane and get the blood move. I don't have to do that with anybody else
[14320.26s -> 14366.25s]  Fuck this. I ran a fucking stamina. I couldn't dodge
[14488.74s -> 14495.82s]  Did I just beat millennia and show my dick on camera
[14498.10s -> 14500.10s]  Please no, I didn't right
[14501.78s -> 14507.75s]  No, oh my god, I'm in trouble. I think I'm in trouble. I actually think
[14508.27s -> 14517.78s]  This this fly is open and I stood up and I like nothing. Oh my god. That was so many emotions in a row
[14518.20s -> 14527.34s]  I'm wearing fucking like pajama pants and these are wide open. I mean, I'm yeah, I'm wearing obviously my god
[14527.34s -> 14534.33s]  I thought I was fucked. Why is it open cut? They're just pajamas. It's just pajamas
[14534.65s -> 14539.36s]  You remember the dream that I had I thought it happened and whatever I was about to just lean into it
[14539.36s -> 14541.40s]  And I whatever I don't know what it would happen to me
[14541.40s -> 14544.40s]  I would have gotten like banned and I don't know what I would have leaned into it
[14544.80s -> 14547.33s]  It would I would be like talking about like oh my god
[14547.33s -> 14554.28s]  We shot German's fucking dick on camera and like whatever. I whatever okay, like I honestly what would I have done?
[14554.28s -> 14557.84s]  I would have been like whatever fine. I do cares. So well, yeah, you saw it. I don't care
[14558.44s -> 14559.92s]  What I have done?
[14559.96s -> 14572.58s]  No, it's the fucking worst thing ever that was actually the worst thing ever
[14573.18s -> 14587.10s]  Even with like cheese strats that was seriously like my teeth were falling out. That was the fucking worst
[14587.90s -> 14590.33s]  Holy shit, that was so bad
[14590.81s -> 14604.02s]  What a shit show. All right, let me I got so lucky at the end there being able to just spam like three moons in a row
[14607.28s -> 14612.96s]  We saw a ball
[14613.44s -> 14619.21s]  Honestly, what am I gonna say if that ever happened? I did that it'd be like, okay
[14620.57s -> 14640.96s]  Well, what do you guys think that one move ruins the fight?
[14640.96s -> 14646.34s]  Honestly, it does it does and I know you you'll get it eventually, but I know you could probably dodge it
[14647.35s -> 14651.39s]  Okay, if you time if you timed anybody out for like telling me to dodge those and I was like ban that person for a
[14651.39s -> 14653.27s]  Day, I'm being everybody
[14653.27s -> 14655.19s]  If I if I'd said that
[14655.19s -> 14670.26s]  Do endurance 30? I guess I have of course I have underwear on but it was like, I don't know
[14670.82s -> 14682.80s]  Well, I'm happy that happened, but we're not done. I still have to do the other thing
[14683.24s -> 14685.24s]  I have to do the last boss
[14685.24s -> 14691.71s]  So what what does that does that just what does that do for me? Does that do anything for me?
[14692.03s -> 14697.00s]  Does that open anything up or ruin?
[14697.80s -> 14701.08s]  Take the pot. Okay
[14701.08s -> 14706.60s]  Remembrance of millennia goddess of the worst boss in the game and should be deleted from the game and no one would be mad
[14706.60s -> 14708.92s]  If she was gone hewn into the urn tree
[14709.44s -> 14711.84s]  Power of its namesake can be unlocked by the finger reader
[14712.48s -> 14714.48s]  alternatively views yeah
[14714.92s -> 14719.80s]  Micola and millennia of both the children of a single god as such they are both
[14720.32s -> 14728.40s]  Imperions but suffered afflictions from birth one was cursed with eternal childhood and the other harbored rot within
[14728.88s -> 14730.56s]  eternal childhood
[14730.56s -> 14737.67s]  Check the mod chat for the clip
[14741.86s -> 14745.81s]  If you guys examined it the mods examine it
[14746.33s -> 14769.39s]  Okay, not the mods have examined it. There's no no balls were showing good. So what eternal childhood? That's weird
[14769.91s -> 14781.48s]  Cursed with eternal who cursed very cool
[14782.16s -> 14795.04s]  So now let's go to the roundtable hold check that great run
[14802.52s -> 14805.88s]  Isolated divine tower which stands beyond the lost great bridge
[14810.03s -> 14812.75s]  Stupid-ass boss has a stupid-ass fucking tower. Where is it?
[14813.35s -> 14816.61s]  Beyond the great bridge like up here

[14938.04s -> 14943.63s]  I really really like this game up until the last like fucking 10 to 20 fucking minutes
[14944.19s -> 14955.49s]  It's hard and this fucking just broken and stupid and like I take a break. That's not gonna fucking do anything
[14960.64s -> 14966.71s]  We'll get 99 arcane if I that you shouldn't have to fucking do that. I'm just not doing it

[14996.39s -> 15000.77s]  And it sucks because the game is actually really fucking fun beside this. It's like an eight now
[15000.77s -> 15002.77s]  I give this like a fucking seven point nine
[15002.77s -> 15006.26s]  Are you telling me to go all the way to the fucking you want me to go get this fucking item?

[15068.46s -> 15073.28s]  Imagine coming into the screen and just seeing the chat just like just spamming Elden ring sucks
[15073.86s -> 15079.06s]  It's like no, it doesn't what why is everybody hated here?
[15087.41s -> 15093.78s]  Sucks like that's what makes me feel better. Just get everybody to say Elden ring sucks
[15094.40s -> 15098.04s]  Yeah, that'll be I that makes me feel so it's like it's midnight. Holy shit
[15099.04s -> 15110.23s]  Extreme you should show us. You should show us crushing watermelons with your thighs
[15111.03s -> 15122.61s]  Do you imagine if I act if I did that like oh today guys, I'm gonna crush watermelons with my thighs
[15123.31s -> 15140.34s]  He's a stupid. What's stopping you? Um a lot of things actually. Oh this thing
[15141.12s -> 15146.69s]  Wow, that's actually kind of cool. So this thing's turned on. I
[15150.79s -> 15164.58s]  What the hell so that's how you get the guy I've looked at this before
[15165.22s -> 15184.10s]  Least on the map isolated to mine tower. This guy doesn't even own a watermelon. I mean, they're not really in season right now
[15184.62s -> 15207.16s]  What was that? What's that? I just like play-doh when you like the play-doh mush things
[15207.16s -> 15209.16s]  Are you push the play-doh through the thing? I?
[15216.71s -> 15226.85s]  Ain't not supposed to do this you fall down. You'll fall backwards, right?
[15227.37s -> 15249.45s]  What would you do if there was another millennia at the top of this tower?
[15250.21s -> 15261.20s]  Um, I would probably turn around and walk away and go fight the last boss
[15261.36s -> 15276.30s]  It's fucked up somebody's who would mean who spoiled it who spoiled it. Oh really? Okay
[15276.88s -> 15317.31s]  Are you guys full of crap? You guys are full of shit. Whoa, you can see a zoo
[15317.31s -> 15330.06s]  I thought that Azula existed in a time like outside of reality or something. Whoa
[15330.44s -> 15339.57s]  So what the hell is going on here? I thought that Azula existed like somewhere way out and not here
[15339.99s -> 15348.63s]  Just the center of the vortex does what happened?
[15349.03s -> 15364.45s]  What happened? Why is that place just destroyed? What I don't understand what happened. I'm in the future
[15364.85s -> 15380.47s]  This thing's in the past. All right. So what is for a boss that was that horrendous?
[15380.47s -> 15383.41s]  What does your rune do attacks recover HP after damage is taken?
[15385.27s -> 15391.96s]  So blood-borne acts made immediately after receiving damage will partially yeah, it's the rally from blood-borne
[15392.44s -> 15397.72s]  That's kind of cool, but I don't really need it. Do I have all the ruins?
[15397.72s -> 15404.57s]  I have I have the entire I have the whole Elden Ring don't I?
[15405.09s -> 15413.27s]  Lenny is daughter to Queen America and Radegon and her great rune should have been the most sacred of all
[15413.27s -> 15445.38s]  I have the whole thing. Okay, where's Mickela's rune? I don't know. Oh the remembrance, right?
[15445.86s -> 15480.43s]  Okay, you need to get the other I don't know and of millennia decks and strength causes blood loss
[15480.97s -> 15485.06s]  Decks 48 laid built into Millennia's prosthetic arm
[15485.70s -> 15493.19s]  Millennia's war prosthesis symbolized her victories some claim to have seen wings when the weapon was raised aloft
[15493.79s -> 15498.05s]  Wings of fierce determination that have been never known to feed until I did it
[15499.23s -> 15502.65s]  Waterfall dance perform a series of one-footed leaps in the manner of a waterfowl
[15503.15s -> 15515.82s]  When Lisa Swift you agree, that's the move. It's the bullshit move. Well, this is I don't have 50 decks
[15515.82s -> 15518.42s]  I'm not gonna get it. This is a faith move
[15518.94s -> 15528.84s]  It's a giant flower that explodes with scarlet rot each time the scarlet flower blooms Millennia's rot advances
[15529.48s -> 15533.50s]  That's bloomed twice already with the third bloom. She will become a true goddess
[15533.98s -> 15539.89s]  We do that
[15539.89s -> 15548.21s]  This whore this whore Lou. Oh, yeah, this is the super. Yeah, I don't we're not gonna do any either of these
[15548.73s -> 15555.26s]  Although this move could be cool
[15559.52s -> 15566.21s]  It's an ash of war which I don't think I can use on either of my weapons get it for you collection
[15566.81s -> 15587.34s]  Melee is usable on all melee assume her soul and buy 500 throwing knives
[15587.82s -> 15593.68s]  What about the equipment you can get the winged helm?
[15594.20s -> 15599.85s]  Winged helm made of unallied gold worn by millennia blade of Michaela
[15600.90s -> 15602.90s]  Millennia awaited Michaela at the foot of the husk
[15603.46s -> 15610.09s]  My brother will keep his promise. He possesses the wisdom the allure of a god. He's the most fearsome Empyrean of all
[15610.09s -> 15617.36s]  I don't want this cuz I hate this boss. I hate this person
[15617.76s -> 15626.76s]  This could give you this could deposit five dollars a second into my bank account and I would still not fucking wear it in principle
[15632.45s -> 15638.37s]  What a dumbass like that's fucking stupid. Oh
[15639.25s -> 15646.26s]  Just put it on and go idle and just go fucking go to the store. Just relax. I just leave it on
[15646.88s -> 15648.88s]  I would even play the game
[15649.24s -> 15655.42s]  five five dollars a second is
[15656.62s -> 15668.22s]  Let me see how much of a dumbass. I really am how many seconds were in a day. There are 60 seconds in a minute
[15670.84s -> 15676.33s]  8,000 660 time 60 times 24
[15681.01s -> 15686.43s]  86,000 it's about 50,000 dollars a day
[15686.95s -> 15694.42s]  50,000
[15695.14s -> 15697.14s]  Day is it a day
[15699.30s -> 15701.86s]  $18,000 an hour and I wouldn't do that
[15702.50s -> 15706.34s]  Holy shit. I did not I must have hated this
[15710.44s -> 15714.76s]  If I got $18,000 a day for putting this armor on and leaving my computer idle
[15716.58s -> 15723.98s]  Fucking dumb. Well now I can't do that. Now the power is taken from me, right?
[15723.98s -> 15731.25s]  I already said I wouldn't so I can't have it cool armor
[15731.25s -> 15745.91s]  Never buying it. Never putting it on. That's cool. So now
[15748.62s -> 15756.10s]  I'm gonna smash them. I'm gonna smash. I'm not gonna use this so I'm gonna smash it
[15756.62s -> 15759.38s]  Plus it means I get to kill her again
[15759.80s -> 15771.00s]  shit, uh
[15771.00s -> 15779.72s]  Maybe I'll get the move for fun. Can I level up? I can't just to level up one more time
[15780.96s -> 15793.08s]  140 I'll get the move try it. I mean why not? It's not like leveling up is gonna do very much anymore. Anyways
[15793.72s -> 15806.71s]  You missed an entire underground area

[15814.28s -> 15818.24s]  Or at least get close enough where I have like one more thing to do

[17156.94s -> 17160.06s]  There's got to be something here some kind of thing that I'm this
[17161.62s -> 17163.54s]  mmm, I can't tell
[17163.54s -> 17177.33s]  Missed an NPC. I mean guys at this stage. There's literally one boss left. I I
[17177.81s -> 17197.78s]  Don't I'm not doing a quest line right now. I think actually I can go back you little runt. He's you
[17198.30s -> 17225.78s]  He's me. Are you gonna fight the final boss tonight? Um
[17226.66s -> 17242.50s]  It's getting really late. So, I don't know. How is it one o'clock?
[17242.90s -> 17246.30s]  Well, uh, we'll see I should probably take a break
[17246.82s -> 17274.56s]  Water you need to go say sorry to Holly night. I did didn't I I'm sorry Holly
[17275.16s -> 17277.66s]  Didn't mean to tell everybody that you were like murderer
[17279.62s -> 17289.34s]  Okay
[17289.74s -> 17295.66s]  Talk to the NPC you get a blood-borne reference
[17296.54s -> 17304.49s]  My mic has been pointed the wrong direction since I punched it like three hours ago
[17305.01s -> 17314.11s]  Have I sounded weird for the last like two or three hours?
[17314.93s -> 17317.81s]  eat brute depths
[17336.06s -> 17344.98s]  Okay, that's actually good for people that are that big. Oh
[17350.74s -> 17353.66s]  No, you know, you can start with it. You cannot finish with it
[17354.30s -> 17364.47s]  These guys were so hard the first like 10 to 20 hours of game. They were terrifying
[17365.29s -> 17370.34s]  staff of the avatar
[17378.20s -> 17380.20s]  C-strength D faith. I
[17380.28s -> 17383.67s]  Actually would probably want to use this
[17383.67s -> 17394.98s]  Bird tree slam. Oh that says the golden shockwaves everywhere shit
[17395.30s -> 17401.85s]  Use the most broken sword the game and says the bosses are easy
[17402.41s -> 17403.49s]  Dude
[17403.49s -> 17409.70s]  This weapon has been equipped for like 4% of my playtime
[17410.34s -> 17416.38s]  Okay, this is the weapon that I'm only using this just because I want to get my plus 10 out of it
[17416.38s -> 17418.30s]  This is what I was using before
[17418.30s -> 17424.24s]  You like I understand that like when people see the moon veil
[17424.28s -> 17430.52s]  They just go rabid because everybody in PvP just like spams it and everyone just hates it and it's an overpowered weapon
[17430.64s -> 17432.64s]  No, I I get it
[17432.96s -> 17434.96s]  But you really gonna do that to me?
[17437.35s -> 17439.71s]  This is my weapon, it's the baby rattle
[17440.67s -> 17459.54s]  I've only used that moon veil or like 2% of the game. So can't level up my axe and my bow
[17460.22s -> 17474.49s]  My bow and my bow. Oh, I'm use the horse
[17475.13s -> 17483.21s]  What flavor of axe body spray do you like do it when they did the chocolate one?
[17485.47s -> 17509.47s]  Yeah, they did it. Yeah, they did a chocolate like body wash and body spray and it was kind of
[17510.11s -> 17515.12s]  Weird it was awful smelling. But at the same time you kind of got used to it and you liked it
[17515.76s -> 17523.40s]  Kind of sounds felt like like like burnt sugar or something. You missed it
[17523.90s -> 17545.58s]  But did I miss you missed it? What did I miss? There's a dung beetle. Whatever be strong. I'll get it
[17545.92s -> 17550.60s]  Yeah, it was really weird. It smelled like
[17551.56s -> 17559.80s]  shit, it was one of those cases where be very careful when you go shopping for body wash
[17560.44s -> 17566.44s]  Because sometimes you'll be there and you'll you pop it open you and whatever you'd like to smell right or like
[17566.44s -> 17571.04s]  How's this one's does this one smell? Okay, right? Don't trust that
[17571.64s -> 17583.38s]  Don't ever trust that you get at home and it smells terrible. Oh my god
[17584.34s -> 17588.34s]  Okay
[17588.34s -> 17608.00s]  Within the hot shower that gets gross go there you liked it because it's felt like shit. Oh
[17612.90s -> 17617.77s]  It's concentrated form smelled. Okay
[17618.69s -> 17626.39s]  When it was heated up, it smelled pretty awful. That's a legendary item. By the way, look at that. That's legendary beam
[17626.79s -> 17651.84s]  I'm gonna have to come from another way. Oh my god scared me
[17652.44s -> 17663.28s]  Okay. Well, whatever am I gonna beat the final boss this stream? Probably not
[17663.92s -> 17677.73s]  One of these okay. Whoa, my goodness. That was okay. That was like in real life when a bug flies next your head
[17677.73s -> 17681.03s]  I was about to just dash out of the room
[17681.59s -> 17684.53s]  Are you gonna at least attempt it?
[17684.53s -> 17686.69s]  Yeah, I don't want to go to too late
[17687.49s -> 17690.76s]  Right, I don't want to just I don't want to go so late
[17691.56s -> 17705.23s]  Depending how long this takes me. I might try like once or twice
[17705.95s -> 17712.76s]  then now I'll actually only have one thing left to do in the game and then we'll do that and then I'll start the like
[17713.04s -> 17715.34s]  PvP night like the invasion night
[17716.16s -> 17720.80s]  Where I invade your game potentially or maybe you summon me and I help you beat
[17721.60s -> 17723.60s]  That piece of shit boss
[17723.84s -> 17727.23s]  You probably combine those creeps together
[17733.95s -> 17736.11s]  River of blood exploit night. No, we'll have rules
[17736.83s -> 17739.66s]  We will ban weapons and if you use them
[17740.30s -> 17758.78s]  You are excommunicated from the community fuck. That's like a minecraft chunk error
[17763.20s -> 17764.08s]  Whoa
[17764.08s -> 17775.66s]  There's a finger reader here. You're good
[17816.60s -> 17818.60s]  I
[17828.14s -> 17843.95s]  What are the two fingers oh
[17845.79s -> 17867.87s]  I think I can level up. They're just an alien radio antenna. Why make them a hand? Why make them
[17874.24s -> 17910.17s]  They're markers down here. What markers do I have here? I don't have any markers. What's that weird? Oh
[17910.65s -> 17922.35s]  Nope ghost level up work five could have used that
[17923.39s -> 17931.47s]  Why let go?
[17931.47s -> 17935.15s]  Oh shit, that's a that's that's quite a congregation of those
[17936.11s -> 17949.61s]  Right so hard, but i'm just way stronger than you. Good try though
[17950.57s -> 17956.01s]  Is it only one?
[17956.01s -> 17958.01s]  That breathes fire. Whatever fucking i'm over leveled
[17958.65s -> 17977.85s]  Astro for vacuum slice. I already have that
[17978.57s -> 17983.63s]  There's not much down here climb the tree
[17984.03s -> 17991.74s]  Let's check
[17991.74s -> 17996.91s]  He's the guy live
[17996.91s -> 17999.79s]  He beat millennia. I did
[17999.79s -> 18005.63s]  I got very lucky. I used a very powerful summon. I didn't use the mimicked here, but I used like the second best
[18006.67s -> 18008.67s]  Summon for that boss
[18011.07s -> 18025.56s]  Oh, there's a map oh shit cool fisha is better than the mimic
[18037.66s -> 18042.12s]  Okay, go all the way west. Yeah
[18043.48s -> 18044.60s]  Is that a
[18044.60s -> 18060.17s]  Three sentinel
[18060.17s -> 18069.90s]  Oh, he's up there. All right
[18069.98s -> 18109.21s]  Oh, come on
[18110.01s -> 18129.15s]  What's happening with the sound
[18129.15s -> 18139.82s]  What's wrong? What was harder millennia or the last little of simpsons hit and run millennia?
[18140.62s -> 18156.32s]  A hundred times and I mean I mean 100 out of 100 times. It's bullshit. No, it's not
[18158.56s -> 18162.38s]  That's the truth
[18162.38s -> 18164.38s]  last level the two towers
[18165.18s -> 18167.18s]  That was fucking awful, too
[18168.33s -> 18172.57s]  So what tree is this if this is here then this is the ur tree, right? These are the
[18173.13s -> 18175.13s]  It's like the roots of the ur tree
[18177.21s -> 18180.01s]  Right, this is the ur tree. Why does it look all fucked up down here?
[18180.65s -> 18184.24s]  Everything looks like all poisoned shitty
[18198.89s -> 18199.77s]  cool
[18199.77s -> 18207.68s]  Because you burnt it
[18207.68s -> 18212.57s]  I didn't a lot of ruins over here
[18215.32s -> 18217.32s]  clarifying clarified butter
[18217.98s -> 18220.83s]  You have to get in that
[18220.83s -> 18275.96s]  Well, there's an omega knight in here fresh on his mind. I wonder if he'll change his mind about it being 100 times harder
[18277.08s -> 18280.52s]  Past your bedtime it is but i'm close to completing
[18281.64s -> 18288.08s]  elden ring
[18288.08s -> 18290.40s]  We'll see how tired i'm i'll take a break after this fight
[18290.80s -> 18295.08s]  This is definitely a fight down here. Why would you tell me to come down here if there wasn't let me look over here
[18307.04s -> 18310.24s]  Oh my god, it's a boss. Oh, I did not think you were you're gonna be here

[18380.54s -> 18382.04s]  the great tree
[18382.04s -> 18384.30s]  ornamentation is the knight celurias mark
[18384.86s -> 18386.78s]  Displayed also by her men
[18386.78s -> 18392.78s]  Holds the power of the crucible of life the primordial form of the urd tree strengthens aspects of the crucible incantations
[18393.42s -> 18403.71s]  This is pretty good
[18403.71s -> 18405.95s]  You only read mean messages. No, I don't think so
[18406.75s -> 18410.72s]  It's like 4 a.m. I am pacific
[18411.20s -> 18414.33s]  Yes, t
[18414.33s -> 18421.95s]  I'm gonna take a quick gander over here
[18422.11s -> 18437.90s]  And we'll go in the coffin. Well, I thought that was a turtle
[18438.78s -> 18449.37s]  There's a bell
[18449.37s -> 18453.15s]  There's one of those bell things here
[18456.01s -> 18457.93s]  down there
[18457.93s -> 18471.72s]  Damn, I don't have an item. All right, be careful
[18476.06s -> 18478.06s]  Oh shit. Cool. All right
[18485.95s -> 18488.11s]  They give you a lot of those uh resemblances
[18489.07s -> 18493.87s]  I don't really care for it right now, but it's cool
[18508.81s -> 18511.16s]  Interesting
[18511.16s -> 18512.76s]  very interesting
[18512.76s -> 18514.62s]  Okay
[18514.62s -> 18528.80s]  What's that part of this mausoleum soldier ashes? Okay, that's cool. I actually want to look at those
[18530.73s -> 18539.87s]  All right coffin time
[18539.87s -> 18544.11s]  A lot of spitting stones here if you're looking for spitting stones five six four five six. There's a shitload here
[18547.68s -> 18556.32s]  Back to the coffin, please don't
[18562.16s -> 18563.52s]  I hear a twinkle
[18563.52s -> 18565.69s]  Uh-huh
[18565.69s -> 18574.65s]  So spitting those I'm not spitting so whatever
[18575.29s -> 18577.45s]  I know the words i'm trying to say it's not coming out right
[18580.64s -> 18583.52s]  Often no, no, no coffin. No not in the coffin
[18585.48s -> 18587.96s]  Up the roots like up here. This is where i'm going
[18588.68s -> 18597.56s]  We're losing them. Am I going the right way?
[18599.66s -> 18602.22s]  Other roots up the roots near the coffin
[18612.72s -> 18614.72s]  Back where the gargoyle was spitting fire at you. Okay
[18624.25s -> 18629.13s]  Don't go in the coffin
[18629.13s -> 18635.87s]  go over there
[18635.87s -> 18637.87s]  backseaters, that's okay, uh, i'm
[18638.35s -> 18640.35s]  actually thankful for the backseaters
[18641.26s -> 18643.92s]  because
[18643.92s -> 18648.32s]  It's getting late and not that I want I don't want to rush through the game. Not a million years
[18649.44s -> 18651.68s]  But it's getting late and I kind of want to see what's down here
[18652.40s -> 18676.70s]  You're saying over here
[18676.70s -> 18679.98s]  there
[18679.98s -> 18693.07s]  Don't help him. No help
[18693.07s -> 18703.82s]  Probably go from here. Um
[18715.39s -> 18716.91s]  I don't think so
[18716.91s -> 18727.56s]  You're
[18727.56s -> 18730.84s]  No, no, no nodders. Don't cough in my face
[18734.16s -> 18736.72s]  Didn't mean to
[18736.72s -> 18738.72s]  Oh up there
[18753.10s -> 18755.10s]  Two fingers stand for peace
[18755.26s -> 18758.08s]  Well, hi, Mr. Litherin
[18758.08s -> 18765.80s]  I don't want that ending
[18765.80s -> 18767.08s]  Oh shit
[18767.08s -> 18773.68s]  How far do I have to go?
[18782.43s -> 18784.43s]  There oh shit
[18786.16s -> 18788.48s]  All the way
[18788.48s -> 18790.48s]  All the way i'm going all the way
[18791.77s -> 18793.05s]  Oh boy
[18793.05s -> 18794.89s]  Oh shit
[18794.89s -> 18810.17s]  Okay
[18810.17s -> 18817.32s]  Why don't I get off the horse?
[18829.66s -> 18855.92s]  This looks like a boss area. What the hell is this?
[18866.75s -> 18870.62s]  That wouldn't happen in real life. If you step on a
[18871.26s -> 18873.26s]  Branch it doesn't explode
[18880.16s -> 18882.16s]  How close do I have to get to this thing?
[18888.96s -> 18892.80s]  What the fuck?
[18892.80s -> 18894.67s]  Oh, no
[18894.67s -> 18897.72s]  It's
[18897.72s -> 18904.89s]  A little shit guy
[18904.89s -> 18906.33s]  Oh, no
[18906.33s -> 18914.19s]  You know i'm gonna let you hit me three times
[18914.19s -> 18916.48s]  two
[18916.48s -> 18918.16s]  Three, okay
[18918.16s -> 18921.31s]  That was four
[18921.31s -> 18925.24s]  That's about enough for you
[18925.24s -> 18930.67s]  So you let a dickhead
[18930.67s -> 18942.48s]  burn
[18942.48s -> 18955.72s]  Got a better idea
[18955.72s -> 18958.76s]  Roger
[18958.76s -> 18960.60s]  What is he doing here? What?
[18960.60s -> 18967.88s]  I don't want to fight roger
[18967.88s -> 18974.91s]  Why bro, they hate you. What did I do? I didn't do anything wrong
[18977.61s -> 18980.65s]  Roger you're still using spells with my level 15 buddy
[18982.01s -> 18984.33s]  It seems the student has become the master
[18985.05s -> 18987.61s]  I hate the way my face looks sometimes
[18995.16s -> 18997.32s]  It seems the student has become the master
[18997.96s -> 19002.97s]  This guy worked for fear. No way
[19011.20s -> 19013.20s]  All right. Who's next in like the fucking?
[19013.76s -> 19017.63s]  gauntlet
[19017.63s -> 19019.39s]  This is okay
[19019.39s -> 19021.84s]  bro, why
[19021.84s -> 19023.84s]  What if lionel the lionheart?
[19024.56s -> 19027.84s]  Fias champ, why am I what's happening? Why is everybody ganging up on me?
[19028.40s -> 19036.14s]  That guy in one swing
[19037.02s -> 19038.86s]  That was somebody's little brother
[19038.86s -> 19040.86s]  You could tell he was wearing the pumpkin head
[19041.18s -> 19045.76s]  Nobody puts that on unless you're like you unless you're like 14
[19046.32s -> 19070.51s]  He's away from me. I might have to kind of like five people at the same time. Lionel is fat rolling
[19071.23s -> 19077.53s]  Is that it?
[19077.53s -> 19081.52s]  He is missed
[19081.52s -> 19084.08s]  Honest to god, what the fuck is that?
[19098.94s -> 19100.78s]  This looks like me
[19100.78s -> 19112.86s]  That's horrifying
[19112.86s -> 19126.24s]  Pumpkin heads actually like pretty good item
[19126.48s -> 19127.68s]  That was rude
[19127.68s -> 19152.65s]  What is it you intend to deny us golden order? I don't even know what they want
[19155.58s -> 19157.58s]  I actually don't know what they want
[19160.68s -> 19166.19s]  Everybody speaks in riddles in these games. Oh, does thou want thy golden finger?
[19166.83s -> 19171.04s]  What is what do you what do you want?
[19171.12s -> 19173.12s]  My lord doth how destined death?

[19674.19s -> 19685.98s]  Can be used to mend the shattered elden ring formed of the two hallowbrand half wheels combined
[19686.06s -> 19688.46s]  It will embed the principle of life within death
[19689.02s -> 19690.62s]  into order

[19833.76s -> 19835.92s]  Gives it more max hp forever

[19877.20s -> 19879.45s]  Daddy daddy
[19879.45s -> 19892.84s]  I'll just tell you take your time. Take your time. It's probably an incredible amount of pressure
[19894.01s -> 19896.17s]  Uh need to come out with some of these videos
[19897.13s -> 19898.57s]  Take your time
[19898.57s -> 19899.61s]  We'll wait
[19899.61s -> 19909.88s]  We'll wait the amount of shit to piece together that i've been seeing from tons of people in the community
[19911.12s -> 19916.96s]  People are still kind of trying to guess what things even mean or what this place actually means
[19917.04s -> 19920.56s]  So this is oh, I found this I found that it's still happening a month later
[19922.62s -> 19925.18s]  Don't feel too much pressure. Seriously, like we can wait
[19928.56s -> 19932.04s]  Very excited though
[19932.04s -> 19934.04s]  Truly truly love your videos. I really do
[19934.76s -> 19946.84s]  Thanks for um stopping by. Can you give us a sneak peek? What the
[19947.48s -> 19948.84s]  the hornblowers
[19948.84s -> 19950.81s]  What are those?
[19950.81s -> 19953.53s]  aliens
[19953.53s -> 19955.55s]  What are the hornblowers?
[19955.55s -> 19958.03s]  Whose fingers are those whose fingers are those?
[19958.75s -> 19960.99s]  Can you give us a little um, give us up small
[19961.63s -> 19964.97s]  Why is there gold shit everywhere this gold dung?
[19968.51s -> 19971.23s]  Everything's gold is the gold ship. Why is there two fingers?
[19971.87s -> 19976.11s]  Okay
[19976.11s -> 19978.11s]  No, i'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding
[19979.68s -> 19981.68s]  He probably gets this shit everywhere
[19982.24s -> 19985.44s]  Like all that he's here
[19985.44s -> 19991.28s]  Explain in in minute detail, uh incredibly intricate stuff that takes like an hour to explain in five seconds
[19991.92s -> 19995.04s]  What does that mean daddy? Like he probably gets his fucking everywhere
[19999.44s -> 20001.44s]  No, uh, it's cool to see you here
[20002.08s -> 20004.78s]  He left
[20006.19s -> 20009.39s]  All right. Well, uh, should I try to beat the last boss? Should I go for it?
[20010.03s -> 20025.96s]  Let's do it. Let's see if I can do it. Oh the coffin. Where does the coffin go?
[20032.08s -> 20033.58s]  Ah the
[20033.58s -> 20034.80s]  remembrances
[20034.80s -> 20036.08s]  right
[20036.08s -> 20041.69s]  If I can pick this up
[20041.69s -> 20048.65s]  After godwin the golden became the prince of death the ancient dragon fought long and hard against the death within its companion
[20049.53s -> 20053.85s]  Alas victory was victory was never achieved and its only reward was corruption
[20055.29s -> 20061.05s]  I think those two fingers are giants. I think they're a giant species of giants and they were killed
[20061.85s -> 20065.85s]  And they only have like hands remaining and they try and they can communicate with the golden order
[20066.49s -> 20073.96s]  I also think that there's two fingers and there's apparently three fingers
[20074.60s -> 20078.60s]  Excuse me. Excuse me. How much does that make?
[20079.42s -> 20081.24s]  Excuse me
[20081.24s -> 20086.86s]  One two, three, four five. Excuse me. That was a whole hand at some point. That's five fingers
[20087.42s -> 20104.70s]  Excuse me
[20104.70s -> 20106.86s]  and why did these
[20106.86s -> 20108.86s]  Why did these fuck off and never come back?
[20109.71s -> 20114.27s]  You would think that the whole world being changed. They'd be like, you know what come out of sleep mode. I don't understand
[20114.83s -> 20121.37s]  odd really
[20121.37s -> 20125.05s]  Fortisax lightning spear and death lightning
[20126.86s -> 20129.12s]  47 faith
[20129.12s -> 20130.88s]  That's probably so cool
[20130.88s -> 20146.67s]  They said this golden lightning was wielded by godwin who befriended fortisax. So why do we just kill fortisax?
[20148.67s -> 20150.67s]  Just eat it. You know, you're going to anyways
[20153.69s -> 20155.23s]  What level am I?
[20155.23s -> 20157.23s]  I am 150 exactly
[20158.65s -> 20161.85s]  We have we are going to probably end the game at 150
[20162.41s -> 20167.47s]  It depends on how if I can actually beat this or not
[20167.87s -> 20172.46s]  All right. Let me give it a good try
[20172.46s -> 20186.11s]  It is late. I don't have to beat it tonight. I am going to
[20187.07s -> 20188.65s]  You're gonna remember the
[20188.65s -> 20190.65s]  Radigan fight because you have to do that first
[20191.13s -> 20192.43s]  Let's go
[20192.43s -> 20202.01s]  Can we break? Here comes the cool music
[20202.65s -> 20206.67s]  Here we go
[20206.67s -> 20215.38s]  final fight
[20215.38s -> 20217.44s]  tarnished
[20217.44s -> 20219.44s]  In search of the elden ring
[20219.84s -> 20223.04s]  Must extinguish thy flame
[20224.00s -> 20228.59s]  of ambition
[20228.59s -> 20275.00s]  begin
[20275.00s -> 20277.00s]  Oh you do another one fuck
[20277.24s -> 20283.13s]  Oh my god, I thought I'd punch me in the face
[20283.61s -> 20284.73s]  I thought I could
[20284.73s -> 20295.47s]  All right. Well, that's been a while. I haven't played this in a while. I haven't played against fucking
[20296.19s -> 20304.14s]  Radigan in a while. I'm so busy fighting millennia of just panicking and dodging every five seconds
[20305.48s -> 20313.16s]  I'll get it. I'll get it. Does that mean
[20320.01s -> 20322.01s]  That happens really quickly
[20327.39s -> 20329.39s]  I try jump if he does that
[20329.98s -> 20331.98s]  You know, I never learned his entire move set
[20333.56s -> 20335.64s]  I literally just summoned somebody and freaked up
[20336.44s -> 20358.57s]  I think you just have to stay close to him
[20358.57s -> 20360.57s]  This also is definitely not a place to have
[20361.85s -> 20363.85s]  Like seven flasks. I need all of them
[20370.01s -> 20371.05s]  also
[20371.05s -> 20373.05s]  Why am I not just using this?
[20374.08s -> 20377.56s]  That was real dumb
[20377.56s -> 20379.88s]  How would I ever use that on the move? It takes way too long
[20380.52s -> 20387.21s]  What can happen? What the fuck happened?
[20389.28s -> 20395.63s]  What happened? He's deflecting. Oh, that's what's going on
[20399.76s -> 20403.04s]  He's deflecting the magic and throwing it back
[20404.41s -> 20406.27s]  Okay
[20406.27s -> 20408.27s]  All right. All right
[20408.59s -> 20428.35s]  I'll get it. So let's just beat the shit out of him. He can't do that to the moon
[20431.80s -> 20433.40s]  Use the laser beam
[20433.40s -> 20435.82s]  What if he just deflects a thousand open row and kills me one hit?
[20437.53s -> 20442.60s]  Try it
[20442.60s -> 20444.60s]  Hold y and press r1
[20444.84s -> 20468.51s]  It's too late now. No, I'm just gonna beat him up
[20469.31s -> 20472.35s]  I did I didn't shoot any spells at him. What the fuck was that bullshit?
[20483.13s -> 20486.73s]  God damn it
[20486.73s -> 20491.45s]  I think I fucking expelled every ounce of gamer juice on on four hours of millennia
[20504.08s -> 20510.70s]  Where are you?
[20510.70s -> 20521.58s]  piece of shit
[20521.58s -> 20565.55s]  Fucking baby route sucks absolute balls like oh my god that hits with every other weapon in the game
[20566.43s -> 20573.74s]  What he's I gotta get around him behind him. I'm dead
[20574.30s -> 20586.11s]  Yeah, you gotta get behind him
[20586.11s -> 20592.00s]  Dude, fuck off
[20592.00s -> 20595.04s]  I didn't want to jump my fat fucking fingers hit it
[20600.30s -> 20602.30s]  You gotta get
[20602.62s -> 20626.57s]  Flail sucks the flail has like a hitbox of like
[20627.69s -> 20628.97s]  here
[20628.97s -> 20630.56s]  it's like
[20630.56s -> 20635.60s]  Here it's literally the hitbox of the flail is like fucking four inches in front of you. It's like
[20642.25s -> 20644.25s]  Elden ring sucks elden ring sucks
[20644.97s -> 20656.41s]  Get this fucking item off. It's the goddamn last boss of the game. You know, who cares?
[20685.76s -> 20696.36s]  He caught it almost all of that. Oh my goodness. He did it twice
[20709.96s -> 20711.56s]  It really makes you feel like you know, did bring you know
[20711.56s -> 20725.44s]  I mean really makes you feel like everything actually was a good strap you can summon
[20725.52s -> 20762.44s]  I want to summon it at the second phase. I think that actually kind of worked. No
[20763.48s -> 20807.80s]  I don't fucking know what to do. Oh my god
[20809.53s -> 20812.41s]  I gotta go behind him. Stop dodging back you fucking idiot
[20813.05s -> 20825.98s]  I didn't mean to press that button and damn it. Fuck the last three bosses of this game
[20826.78s -> 20845.90s]  I gotta start off
[20845.98s -> 20850.44s]  But you don't like aoe spam bosses
[20851.24s -> 20852.89s]  No
[20852.89s -> 20854.89s]  No, I don't no, I don't
[20860.94s -> 20872.70s]  Underleveled what i'm level 150. What do you it's easy to dodge all of his attacks
[20873.26s -> 20898.27s]  Just fucking didn't bring tish in your pocket. What are you talking about?
[20930.56s -> 20933.24s]  What I dodged it
[20938.84s -> 20941.16s]  Teach you and I are good friends
[20941.88s -> 20954.20s]  I've never seen this part
[20954.20s -> 20962.12s]  I know what happens here l plus over level plus still losing plus using the katana plus using comet azor plus ratio
[20963.08s -> 20973.74s]  Let's go, let's do it again. This is fucking who cares
[20982.52s -> 20994.96s]  Where where what's going on? Oh my god, what how do I do this? What do I do?

[21048.94s -> 21051.18s]  This is a car's driving at me 100 miles per hour
[21057.40s -> 21061.39s]  Oh god, damn it
[21061.39s -> 21072.80s]  You just run
[21072.80s -> 21076.72s]  Holy shit
[21076.72s -> 21078.72s]  I'm just doing it. I don't even care

[21147.10s -> 21157.06s]  I just like you're just filling my screen with just colors
[21163.56s -> 21166.76s]  It's like what the fuck is happening this is five people altered at the same time
[21167.40s -> 21202.35s]  Oh, I didn't even fucking go this way
[21220.01s -> 21223.13s]  My fucking hand is so sweaty. You can sometimes you can't even press the button
[21238.27s -> 21240.27s]  Don't hit me. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. Don't hit me
[21240.35s -> 21255.63s]  I thought he was dead
[21255.63s -> 21275.66s]  All right, let's go. How do you get sweaty from pressing buttons? I've been holding this control over six straight hours. Oh god
[21276.38s -> 21279.02s]  I'm gonna get behind him
[21279.02s -> 21281.02s]  No, i'm not what I don't know what to do about this
[21287.24s -> 21289.48s]  God, I can't fucking hit animation shit
[21290.28s -> 21299.37s]  Can I get on the horse? Of course not
[21303.18s -> 21305.90s]  I just don't get in that right? Don't let it get inside
[21307.40s -> 21308.60s]  I don't
[21308.60s -> 21309.80s]  Am I in it?
[21309.80s -> 21311.61s]  Do I have to jump over it?
[21311.61s -> 21339.48s]  I think you have to jump over it. I don't know. Oh damn it run. Oh, it's right on my heels
[21348.99s -> 21351.07s]  You really have to go all the fucking way over there
[21359.39s -> 21360.67s]  Out of stamina
[21360.67s -> 21368.91s]  What the fuck let me over there
[21370.78s -> 21392.91s]  Bastard, sorry for the language. You just I don't fucking know
[21414.06s -> 21416.70s]  Why do you keep fucking going away fight me?
[21433.82s -> 21435.82s]  Jesus christ
[21455.12s -> 21459.77s]  I don't
[21459.77s -> 21461.93s]  What the fuck come over here?
[21462.81s -> 21478.99s]  All right, my heels
[21478.99s -> 21488.01s]  I have one heel
[21488.01s -> 21493.05s]  Oh my goodness this fucking swing animation. All of you motherfuckers are in slow motion in this goddamn game
[21494.01s -> 21505.00s]  It's like everybody's in slow motion and everybody just explodes the whole fucking boss room
[21518.16s -> 21523.20s]  This motherfucker run. He's like, okay you get close and then he just teleports across the whole game. Where's my horse?
[21526.03s -> 21527.72s]  Guess what?
[21527.72s -> 21529.80s]  The game crashed
[21529.80s -> 21534.26s]  What a surprise this fucking six out of ten
[21560.24s -> 21593.05s]  Teleport see it run it, please come chase me. I'm gonna beat it right now. I know the game didn't I know I understand
[21593.37s -> 21610.28s]  I need rest. I almost just did it get rid of this fucking thing. I don't want this. I'm just using it
[21610.36s -> 21617.28s]  I don't want this thing in my inventory
[21633.10s -> 21674.81s]  Me strong exposed. Ah, damn it. I wasn't close enough. You're gonna fucking do it three times
[21688.83s -> 21690.35s]  Thank you tish
[21690.35s -> 21716.00s]  Let's go. Oh my god from software. What the fuck is that? I tried to lock on and it's
[21716.64s -> 21750.67s]  This is the ring. I don't get this fucking key. I think I jump. I'm gonna try jumping over it
[21751.23s -> 21753.31s]  I'm gonna jump over it. I'm gonna jump over it
[21755.88s -> 21765.45s]  Ah
[21765.45s -> 21768.81s]  What is what the fuck is in the way? What the fuck is go? I can't see shit
[21770.59s -> 21772.59s]  What get this fucking mist out of here?
[21773.60s -> 21775.85s]  What the hell?
[21775.85s -> 21777.85s]  I couldn't fucking see anything
[21778.17s -> 21794.04s]  Was that actually the end of the look at how huge this place is
[21807.29s -> 21811.61s]  He dodged it. Yeah tish didn't have like gold vapor in his eyes
[21812.86s -> 21816.78s]  Or in her eyes. So I can't who are you? What's your name?
[21818.73s -> 21820.25s]  She uh, yeah
[21820.25s -> 21837.29s]  Fucking idiot put elden beast in the meat grinder just like they just decided to just
[21841.74s -> 21845.10s]  Uh, I got it. I got a pigman's but we'll talk about him later
[21847.50s -> 21892.08s]  my man
[21892.08s -> 21894.08s]  Oh, I fucking messed it up
[21894.40s -> 21903.96s]  A lot of aoe spam bosses just they just shoot it and brought the whole fucking road
[21904.84s -> 21917.84s]  What if I happen to swinging swords at each other?
[21918.24s -> 21922.27s]  Does every last like three or four bosses in this game have to have a fucking
[21922.91s -> 21924.91s]  bomb that a bomb
[21925.23s -> 21947.34s]  An over and over again fucking missile. I can't even hear the music over it
[21948.16s -> 21950.32s]  You're just dropping fucking missiles, man
[21950.88s -> 21991.72s]  I didn't think he had another attack, but how the fuck can you tell in this game?
[21992.52s -> 21996.49s]  You're going explosions
[21996.73s -> 22025.56s]  Oh fuck
[22025.56s -> 22029.08s]  Shaking my god damn shaking my head shaking my ss-ing my head
[22029.72s -> 22031.48s]  Shake shaking my head
[22031.48s -> 22050.88s]  I'm curious. Does this do any damage?
[22050.96s -> 22076.84s]  I can't even tell how far away I am from this motherfucker. I swear to god
[22077.80s -> 22120.35s]  All right jump over it thought I could go through it
[22141.42s -> 22143.66s]  Get away from me
[22144.54s -> 22146.54s]  You're such a fucking missile
[22147.24s -> 22149.24s]  Get this fucking thing away from me
[22151.05s -> 22155.21s]  What the fuck man, leave me. Oh my god. It's on the elden ring
[22167.66s -> 22184.64s]  No, what the fuck I attack him
[22185.60s -> 22199.87s]  I didn't want to roll that way
[22204.01s -> 22210.57s]  Please kill it. Please kill it. Please kill it. Please kill it
[22239.07s -> 22242.94s]  That was horrible
[22242.94s -> 22261.92s]  fractured america
[22261.92s -> 22263.44s]  summon ronnie
[22263.44s -> 22269.66s]  Oh, let me do this first
[22269.66s -> 22273.45s]  You know, I haven't I actually I haven't uh, there's a couple little dungeons
[22273.45s -> 22277.77s]  I want to do in limb grave because I didn't see what this was. I think i'm gonna go check that out
[22281.04s -> 22323.55s]  Summon ronnie battle is over. I see
[22324.35s -> 22353.28s]  He has four hands
[22353.28s -> 22371.90s]  I do solemnly swear
[22374.72s -> 22383.32s]  To every living being and every living soul now cometh the age of the stars
[22385.12s -> 22389.04s]  Did I make a mistake here a thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the moon
[22391.71s -> 22394.91s]  Here begineth the chill night that encompasses all
[22395.87s -> 22397.87s]  Reaching the great beyond
[22401.88s -> 22403.69s]  into fear
[22403.69s -> 22410.56s]  Doubtliness path stretcheth into darkness
[22416.67s -> 22445.96s]  Let us go together
[22445.96s -> 22447.96s]  My dear consort eternal
[22460.27s -> 22472.43s]  I
[22475.40s -> 22486.28s]  Beat the boss if I was stupid
[22496.52s -> 22508.70s]  He blacked out. Yeah. Wow. What did I say six out of ten? That's um, that was me being angry
[22509.34s -> 22529.56s]  It's way better than that. It happens what I don't get it. Heesh is the true elden lord
[22535.71s -> 22540.25s]  Rainy all right, what happened? Heesh literally killed the boss for you good. I'm glad
[22543.07s -> 22546.56s]  It's complicated
[22546.56s -> 22550.72s]  Rainy started a thousand years of night killing the tree and freeing the souls then okay
[22551.44s -> 22556.48s]  Basically give her the power and she decides to fuck off into space with you leaving the planet without a mean god to rule over it
[22557.28s -> 22559.28s]  No more gods people control their own lives
[22561.08s -> 22563.08s]  Started a new age. No more elden ring
[22563.64s -> 22566.40s]  You just gave them self-government
[22568.97s -> 22575.95s]  Huh? No more greater. No more bullshit greater will and two fingers
[22576.75s -> 22580.88s]  Oh who care? Yeah, fuck them. They they they they fucked off
[22581.52s -> 22584.06s]  halfway through the game
[22584.06s -> 22586.06s]  Which I don't get that either. Why do they leave?
[22590.60s -> 22593.72s]  They just like they went like they lost the connection to the router
[22598.25s -> 22601.16s]  Everyone gets free will now
[22601.16s -> 22607.69s]  Seems pretty good
[22607.69s -> 22609.69s]  the rating for the game, uh
[22610.09s -> 22612.40s]  It was nine point seven
[22612.48s -> 22615.52s]  After the millennia fight and after that fight, it's a nine point
[22632.64s -> 22638.30s]  nine point six
[22638.30s -> 22640.30s]  nine point six five
[22640.88s -> 22642.56s]  Nine no
[22642.56s -> 22644.64s]  That's not that's horseshit. It's it's higher
[22646.64s -> 22650.80s]  Okay, I honestly I thought these I thought this was like a kickstarter. I thought these like kickstarter people
[22651.60s -> 22656.40s]  There's so many names just here. I thought this was like thanking like the kickstarter people
[22657.66s -> 22659.16s]  um
[22659.16s -> 22661.16s]  Holy shit, that's a lot of names
[22661.58s -> 22663.58s]  Uh, it's a nine
[22663.82s -> 22665.60s]  It's a nine
[22665.60s -> 22667.60s]  The nine point eight is so simple. It's so easy
[22677.66s -> 22679.34s]  nine seven feels
[22679.34s -> 22682.03s]  Correct, but I feel like it's low
[22682.03s -> 22683.63s]  nine point seven eight
[22683.63s -> 22687.47s]  There it is a nine. It's a nine point seven eight
[22694.84s -> 22703.80s]  Bloodborne was a nine point four. This is better than bloodborne
[22704.36s -> 22714.94s]  I I think so that's slander
[22715.58s -> 22718.22s]  This is coming from somebody whose bloodborne has been their favorite
[22718.94s -> 22722.94s]  Well, it's bloodborne has been my favorite game ever all of all time since it came out
[22723.58s -> 22726.91s]  If bloodborne was 60 fps
[22727.31s -> 22729.31s]  It might be it might be a lot closer
[22729.95s -> 22731.71s]  nine point seven eight
[22731.71s -> 22734.91s]  It's it's this is so close to being a perfect game
[22738.28s -> 22742.12s]  And like what's the theory you think there is no such thing as a perfect thing?
[22742.68s -> 22745.80s]  Ten does not exist. It doesn't there's no such thing as a ten
[22746.52s -> 22752.38s]  And like a nine point nine feels like like horseshit, right? Like, okay, really?
[22752.86s -> 22754.86s]  You gave it a nine point nine
[22758.65s -> 22762.84s]  And doesn't mean perfect
[22762.84s -> 22765.16s]  It probably is a ten ask me tomorrow
[22766.94s -> 22769.10s]  Sekiro, I did not I was not a big fan of Sekiro
[22769.66s -> 22775.08s]  I thought Sekiro was good, but I I did not think it holds up to this
[22775.64s -> 22782.44s]  All right, ask me tomorrow. It's probably like a nine point eight seven
[22784.73s -> 22787.69s]  But wow, what a fucking app as a masterpiece it is
[22788.25s -> 22794.27s]  He said half-life alex was a nine point six
[22795.47s -> 22797.23s]  Yeah, and this is better
[22797.23s -> 22800.43s]  By a small amount. I think it is better than now half-life alex
[22800.99s -> 22807.20s]  Half-life alex is in a different kind of category for me though, but this this is better than half-life alex
[22807.76s -> 22815.18s]  Was bloodborne worse than half-life alex?
[22816.06s -> 22818.22s]  No, it just ran like shit
[22820.17s -> 22823.21s]  It just ran like shit and we can all pretend like it didn't
[22824.89s -> 22827.37s]  Bloodborne seriously runs like crap
[22831.45s -> 22832.89s]  And they did okay
[22832.89s -> 22834.57s]  It was on ps4
[22834.57s -> 22841.29s]  And they didn't even give a ps4 pro version or some anything anything to get it away from like the 28 to 30
[22841.37s -> 22843.37s]  FPS that it was in 25 fps
[22845.15s -> 22850.75s]  I just wish there was even a ps5 version for it anything anything to make that game not like 25 fps
[22854.35s -> 22860.19s]  This game is heavily flawed. I think you've heard me complain about half of the things that we've yeah
[22861.76s -> 22865.04s]  But even with a lot of this game's issues when I was like, oh, we'll talk about that later
[22867.87s -> 22870.36s]  for open world games
[22870.52s -> 22873.16s]  Nothing comes remotely close the last open
[22873.32s -> 22877.88s]  Look at the last open world game that you played that you gave a shit about like really beside don't say breath of the wild
[22877.88s -> 22879.24s]  We all know what you're gonna say
[22879.24s -> 22883.34s]  Forget about breath of the wild
[22883.34s -> 22887.74s]  I haven't given a absolute fuck about any open world game. They're all dog shit
[22888.46s -> 22891.90s]  I haven't played a truly good open world game in a long time red dead redemption 2 was good
[22892.54s -> 22894.54s]  but red dead redemption 2 felt
[22896.88s -> 22902.64s]  Didn't feel like this. I loved red dead redemption 2 story and its world
[22904.38s -> 22906.62s]  But I think this trumps it in sort of
[22908.15s -> 22909.61s]  gameplay
[22909.61s -> 22911.61s]  kind of immersion
[22911.61s -> 22913.85s]  red dead redemption 2 is very good don't get me wrong, but
[22915.02s -> 22917.10s]  I don't think it it I don't think they even compare
[22917.82s -> 22926.14s]  Red dead redemption 2 is a good movie
[22926.70s -> 22931.82s]  Yeah, I okay. I sat there with red dead redemption 2 and loved every second of it. But yeah, I was kind of just
[22932.94s -> 22934.94s]  trotting around on the horse and
[22935.18s -> 22937.18s]  talking to like dutch and
[22937.66s -> 22940.94s]  Crafting food and gunslinging. It was a lot different
[22941.50s -> 22943.96s]  Did you begin journey 2?
[22943.96s -> 22945.00s]  Oh, okay
[22945.00s -> 22954.68s]  You can do it from the round table a war open world game has not done that to me how I feel about this
[22955.64s -> 22958.75s]  since
[22958.75s -> 22959.95s]  God, I don't know
[22959.95s -> 22963.44s]  gta 4 maybe
[22963.44s -> 22965.26s]  maybe gta 5
[22965.26s -> 22972.86s]  But even gta 5. Yeah, I remember playing gta 5 and I was fucking floored
[22973.50s -> 22977.34s]  GTA 4 maybe a little bit more because that was the first time where it was like a new engine
[22977.98s -> 22981.77s]  It's been about 10 years
[22981.77s -> 22990.73s]  Fingers still gone check the remembrances. Yeah, I will
[22992.70s -> 22995.07s]  Yeah, I got to look at
[22995.07s -> 22997.95s]  Yeah, and of course, okay look for all my frustrations with this game
[22998.59s -> 23002.27s]  For all the times you heard me say like this sucks. It's dog shit. It's coke
[23003.07s -> 23007.87s]  This truly is one of the best games that's ever been made. I think everybody can agree on that even if you don't like it
[23009.29s -> 23013.29s]  This is without a single doubt in my mind will will go down
[23014.59s -> 23018.43s]  As one of the single greatest pieces of playable media ever
[23019.64s -> 23023.23s]  I really do feel that way
[23023.31s -> 23033.98s]  Let me show you something about god of war god of war
[23035.16s -> 23038.27s]  I yeah
[23038.27s -> 23040.27s]  When I walked out here for the first time
[23041.56s -> 23043.56s]  And knew that I had no directions
[23044.60s -> 23048.09s]  And I saw this
[23048.09s -> 23049.69s]  It was a feeling
[23049.69s -> 23054.41s]  That was just like right here that I haven't felt since I was like fucking probably 20 like 19
[23056.08s -> 23060.24s]  That's how I gauge whether or not a game is like like holy shit. This is crazy
[23061.72s -> 23062.84s]  uh
[23062.84s -> 23067.56s]  Walking down here and realizing like how much is here going even to these first this first like kind of shack
[23068.36s -> 23070.60s]  Realizing that you can find things on the map
[23071.80s -> 23073.93s]  find little dungeons
[23074.01s -> 23078.09s]  It's terrifying it is an overwhelming horrifying experience
[23081.98s -> 23085.10s]  Nothing has done that since probably I don't know maybe like
[23086.25s -> 23091.40s]  eat the engineer video
[23091.40s -> 23093.40s]  Game is very front-loaded. I will
[23097.90s -> 23103.16s]  I will say the this the game is very front-loaded. I think that this area here
[23104.46s -> 23106.75s]  leading into k-lid
[23106.75s -> 23111.90s]  and then a little bit probably I but hold on I did love um, I did really like the
[23112.46s -> 23114.89s]  kind of capital area
[23114.89s -> 23119.42s]  Elmer was really cool, too
[23119.42s -> 23122.54s]  I I can't say that this was particularly like incredible
[23123.26s -> 23125.26s]  It's kind of just snow and fog
[23126.65s -> 23127.61s]  but
[23127.61s -> 23128.81s]  I don't think
[23128.81s -> 23130.81s]  This first like 10 to 20 hours of the game
[23131.29s -> 23133.66s]  Maybe even the first 30 to 40 hours
[23134.33s -> 23137.37s]  And ray lucaria was crazy too like walking in these front doors
[23138.17s -> 23145.87s]  And making dlc as well. Yeah
[23145.87s -> 23149.95s]  Like when you do this, I did it on stream. You saw how I reacted to it
[23152.09s -> 23153.87s]  You go through here
[23153.87s -> 23155.87s]  And you get to see the ray lucaria building
[23157.44s -> 23159.72s]  Yeah, azula was yeah
[23159.72s -> 23162.12s]  There's way more good zones than bad zones. Let's put it that way
[23162.68s -> 23167.58s]  The game does fall off a little bit at the end. I I have to admit that
[23169.53s -> 23172.73s]  Kind of feels like they just throw a bunch of shit at you in the last like 10 hours
[23174.80s -> 23176.80s]  Like seeing this in the distance
[23176.88s -> 23179.68s]  Seeing like azula in the distance being here seeing the ur trees
[23184.33s -> 23186.41s]  But the first 40 hours of this game
[23187.21s -> 23191.12s]  Makes up for the last five to ten hours a hundred times over
[23191.68s -> 23200.28s]  Is the
[23200.28s -> 23211.42s]  Where's the it's is it right here? Where's the the we can see the building the end bosses ain't aren't bad though
[23212.38s -> 23215.18s]  I just I feel like the last couple bosses just felt like just very
[23215.80s -> 23220.03s]  spammy and annoying
[23220.03s -> 23223.26s]  And you know what? Here's a complaint
[23224.62s -> 23226.62s]  We have this really cool horse
[23227.26s -> 23229.26s]  We don't get like a final like epic
[23229.82s -> 23235.26s]  Battle where we can use the horse in that last area against the elden beast. That would be cool
[23237.55s -> 23241.15s]  Like torrent's been with us the whole game and we don't get to kind of have that ending with horn
[23241.95s -> 23244.75s]  I feel like that's that's a big ball drop
[23245.84s -> 23247.84s]  Especially because the boss moves around so much
[23251.96s -> 23258.76s]  I wanted to take torrent to the end but torrent really kind of felt like a real afterthought in the last like 10 hours or so
[23259.56s -> 23262.94s]  The fire giant was the last time that I really think thought I really needed to use it
[23266.78s -> 23271.96s]  But that's not why that's why I don't think it's 10. I think it's like one of the best games ever made
[23272.12s -> 23274.68s]  I think it's like a nine seven nine eight nine nine, maybe
[23275.32s -> 23277.32s]  Who gives a shit about scores? That's stupid. Anyways
[23278.44s -> 23282.36s]  Who cares about like me have I got to give you like a score. No, this is one of the best games ever made
[23282.36s -> 23284.16s]  That's all you need to know
[23284.16s -> 23288.32s]  Stamp it recommended best game one of the best games of all time. That's it. That's all I need to know
[23288.40s -> 23291.76s]  Who cares about like an arbitrary? Well nine point seven eight like
[23292.72s -> 23294.56s]  Why am I even having that number?
[23294.56s -> 23303.74s]  I'm making that number up that number makes no sense. I'm going to the same place
[23312.36s -> 23317.32s]  Better than bloodborne. Yeah, it is but just because it's just a newer game newer technology not on a playstation 4
[23318.20s -> 23329.34s]  And you know, it's kind of depressing in a way, you know that post
[23330.22s -> 23333.98s]  Uh best masterpiece game ever made kind of depression here
[23335.42s -> 23338.62s]  I'm like sad the game is over. That's why I haven't gone to bed yet
[23339.26s -> 23342.89s]  Yeah, like look at this like this is just this was so awe-inspiring
[23343.45s -> 23347.55s]  It's like this will be explained really well
[23349.58s -> 23351.58s]  What the fuck is in there?
[23353.76s -> 23355.20s]  You don't know
[23355.20s -> 23358.64s]  You know, it's gonna be really you're gonna be you're probably gonna be in that room somehow
[23359.36s -> 23363.68s]  You're gonna be all over this place i'm seeing it at a macro kind of scale
[23365.04s -> 23367.28s]  It hits you in this weird way where you just don't
[23368.24s -> 23372.64s]  You're so confused. You're so terrified of this thing. You're so awe inspired
[23374.28s -> 23376.76s]  You know, you're gonna walk around every room in this place
[23378.17s -> 23380.17s]  And you know, it's gonna be hard and you know, it's gonna be scary
[23380.49s -> 23384.70s]  But like let's fucking go
[23384.70s -> 23386.94s]  Is this the honeymoon period or do you actually really like it?
[23388.03s -> 23392.91s]  I mean, it's been almost like 40 days. I don't think there's much more time for a honeymoon phase
[23393.63s -> 23402.43s]  Yeah
[23402.43s -> 23405.79s]  A lot of places like in the game did that especially in limb grave, especially here
[23406.51s -> 23414.91s]  There's a fake wall in there
[23414.91s -> 23416.91s]  And let me find let me find my favorite spot
[23417.61s -> 23418.57s]  but
[23418.57s -> 23421.53s]  I'll I know i'm kind of stalling to end the stream here, but still
[23423.48s -> 23428.67s]  um, I know i'm stalling but
[23429.50s -> 23432.24s]  having that area
[23432.24s -> 23439.85s]  Where you can see this? Let me see if I can find it here. It's from a cliff
[23440.49s -> 23443.29s]  And it's just you can't even believe that you can see it
[23443.93s -> 23449.80s]  Where is it? It's kind of far away. Maybe here
[23450.52s -> 23458.27s]  Is one spot where you can see the lacaria and a couple other things
[23461.74s -> 23463.90s]  North of stormville. Okay. Yeah, I know it's like up here somewhere
[23465.48s -> 23472.68s]  This is it right here. Yeah, I mean the stream's over but I mean we're just hanging out
[23478.30s -> 23484.12s]  Yeah, this is it here. It's just
[23485.58s -> 23488.22s]  You know, all right, you just saw it up close
[23489.77s -> 23491.29s]  from far away
[23491.29s -> 23493.21s]  it seems
[23493.21s -> 23496.41s]  The journey seems so awesome from here to there
[23498.28s -> 23502.28s]  Mount gallimard is right there. You got one of the churches you got ready. Look harry a lot of the it
[23503.00s -> 23507.15s]  It's just I love it. It's sad that it's over
[23508.99s -> 23510.43s]  But that's what means
[23510.43s -> 23511.87s]  I'm about to r1
[23511.87s -> 23515.58s]  Hello, there's someone there. My name is hietta
[23516.73s -> 23518.89s]  And i'm journeying in search of the distant light
[23519.45s -> 23521.45s]  I wish the ruins weren't so repetitive
[23522.49s -> 23524.49s]  Some of those done. All right
[23525.05s -> 23530.01s]  If we're gonna okay you just heard me gush about the game some of those dungeons were dogs of shit
[23530.57s -> 23535.55s]  Some of those dungeons were just awful. It's truly terrible just complete afterthoughts
[23537.77s -> 23539.77s]  It was
[23540.33s -> 23543.37s]  I want to say maybe five to maybe like 10 of them were pretty awful
[23546.36s -> 23548.76s]  But that's not that there's so much in the game though
[23549.24s -> 23553.96s]  It's so easy for me to sit here and not for us to be like that was fucking stupid. Those dungeons were terrible
[23556.30s -> 23559.74s]  but I mean like
[23559.74s -> 23564.64s]  Look at all this
[23564.64s -> 23569.26s]  You don't have to do them
[23569.26s -> 23574.38s]  That's why it's not a perfect game, but it's pretty damn fucking close and I know i've been swearing a lot
[23574.38s -> 23576.14s]  But I just i'm exhausted
[23576.14s -> 23579.42s]  There's a bunch of disappointing triple a releases. It's pretty great
[23581.05s -> 23585.45s]  Yeah, that too that too. Let's be let's let's get no let's talk no more criticism
[23587.37s -> 23589.93s]  I think this
[23589.93s -> 23591.64s]  shows
[23591.64s -> 23595.16s]  That you can still make incredible experiences that people
[23597.58s -> 23599.74s]  That people will the jaw will hit the floor still
[23600.30s -> 23604.54s]  I know a god of war it was an I told you the first like two or three hours of god of war
[23604.54s -> 23606.54s]  I thought were fucking unbelievable
[23606.86s -> 23607.66s]  um
[23607.66s -> 23612.04s]  I feel like that game dropped off for me a little bit though. But again that first like hour
[23612.84s -> 23615.40s]  God of war especially that first major fight
[23616.12s -> 23620.28s]  Was like it did the same thing it hit me in the same place. I was like, holy shit. This is cool
[23622.20s -> 23626.44s]  Uh, it's still it's still here and anybody that tells you that like oh gaming is fucking dead
[23627.08s -> 23631.72s]  Every all games suck. It's fucking awful what the industry is in this in the shitter right now
[23631.80s -> 23633.64s]  It's like I mean this look at this
[23633.64s -> 23639.72s]  this exists
[23639.72s -> 23640.89s]  um
[23640.89s -> 23642.89s]  And my god what a journey it was
[23643.53s -> 23648.00s]  What are we at for time?
[23648.08s -> 23650.96s]  105 well, let's say 104 104 hours
[23655.05s -> 23658.09s]  I've i've never put 100 hours into a single campaign ever
[23658.89s -> 23660.89s]  I don't think that's that's never happened
[23661.21s -> 23664.83s]  I have to be real
[23664.83s -> 23666.11s]  that has
[23666.11s -> 23668.28s]  Never happened my whole life
[23668.28s -> 23673.16s]  Never
[23673.16s -> 23676.76s]  I played through bloodborne a bunch of times, but all those playthroughs were like 40 hours
[23677.24s -> 23682.20s]  40 to 50 hours dark souls 3 was like 50 hours, right 40 to 60 hours maybe
[23687.28s -> 23695.44s]  GTA 5 would probably come close somewhere around probably like 70 or 80 not 100 one more for the road
[23701.23s -> 23707.52s]  How many times did I die in total what's the total death count
[23716.79s -> 23720.06s]  736 times
[23720.08s -> 23725.07s]  Oh my god
[23725.61s -> 23727.84s]  736
[23727.84s -> 23731.76s]  But yeah, all right. Let me tell you my plans for the future of this game because i'm not done with it
[23732.40s -> 23737.47s]  Because i'm sad and I don't want it to end so it's not going to
[23738.40s -> 23740.24s]  We are going to do
[23740.24s -> 23743.13s]  a like community night
[23743.13s -> 23747.69s]  I am going to you can summon me. We'll do i'll put my sign down without a password. We'll do summons
[23748.49s -> 23750.49s]  You guys are having trouble with something. Maybe I can come help
[23751.64s -> 23755.08s]  Me strong needs to do his first like 10 hours first five hours
[23756.12s -> 23757.88s]  Maybe first two hours
[23757.88s -> 23761.64s]  I want to do like a pvp like invasion night. At least maybe we'll come down the whole thing
[23766.16s -> 23768.00s]  So it's not over
[23768.00s -> 23772.08s]  But it's not going to be a priority anymore considering. I just beat it
[23775.48s -> 23777.87s]  Elden ring
[23777.87s -> 23779.87s]  Is now it's not going to be every single stream
[23782.00s -> 23783.36s]  It will be
[23783.36s -> 23789.50s]  In once in a while, maybe maybe the next stream will probably be something else. We'll probably move to some. Uh, well, we'll see
[23791.56s -> 23793.56s]  But it's not a priority anymore
[23793.72s -> 23800.40s]  And that's the end of the stream. Thanks for staying up late
[23801.04s -> 23806.68s]  Thanks for putting up with my anger and my bullshit. I really appreciate it as always of course
[23807.64s -> 23811.04s]  Wrong thing. That was an incredible journey
[23811.84s -> 23813.84s]  Game is unbelievably good
[23814.91s -> 23818.03s]  And I am incredibly happy to have shared it with you
[23818.67s -> 23822.20s]  Let's just be real
[23822.20s -> 23824.20s]  That was uh, uh, really fun
[23825.29s -> 23827.37s]  I'll be uh, let's be let me be really honest
[23827.93s -> 23832.17s]  That was some of the most fun just kind of playing a video game and hanging out with you guys i've had in a long time
[23832.89s -> 23850.04s]  Dad to see it go. I didn't even look at the remembrances. It's true. That was amazing
[23857.10s -> 23858.78s]  so, uh
[23858.78s -> 23863.50s]  See, uh, see another 10 years when another like fucking masterpiece comes out. God damn it
[23866.27s -> 23868.11s]  America's hammer
[23868.11s -> 23873.10s]  Stone hammer made in the lands of the newman
[23873.74s -> 23875.58s]  outside the lands between
[23875.58s -> 23879.82s]  The tool with which queen marika shattered the elden ring and radigan attempted to repair it
[23884.14s -> 23889.88s]  Wait, the hammer partially broke upon shattering the ring becoming splintered with ruined fragments
[23890.36s -> 23895.16s]  This is not a masterpiece
[23895.24s -> 23898.01s]  I think it is
[23898.01s -> 23899.21s]  I think it is
[23899.21s -> 23903.82s]  We can have different opinions. That's all right
[23903.98s -> 23907.39s]  I don't think it's perfect, but I do think it's a masterpiece
[23911.48s -> 23915.13s]  sacred relic sword
[23915.13s -> 23916.49s]  Thoughts on what the weapon
[23916.49s -> 23921.77s]  Or tens are many and varied some consider it the mark of a great sin or a sign of great devastation
[23922.25s -> 23925.05s]  Some think it is at the end of an age while others the beginning
[23925.77s -> 23932.49s]  Can view the sword with bygone golden glory then fire at foes a wide golden wave fans out sweeping through all enemies caught in its path
[23935.36s -> 23938.64s]  Another faith dex faith. It's the farming sword
[23939.44s -> 23947.12s]  There's masterpieces you haven't played yet
[23950.86s -> 23952.86s]  I okay, let's announce it
[23953.85s -> 23957.12s]  I'll play breath of the wild
[23957.12s -> 23962.04s]  I will not immediately but we'll cue it up
[23963.24s -> 23965.24s]  I will cue up breath of the wild and we'll play it
[23974.28s -> 23977.88s]  You can't play breath of the wild after this. I'm not gonna we're gonna wait a little bit
[23978.76s -> 23980.76s]  I'm not gonna just like oh, hey guys, uh
[23981.64s -> 23988.75s]  Wednesday stream is breath of the wild now. I'll give it some time. This is really cool though
[23989.31s -> 23993.76s]  I'm not gonna do any of that right now
[23993.76s -> 23994.80s]  All right
[23994.80s -> 23996.32s]  enough stalling
[23996.32s -> 23998.43s]  Thanks for staying up with me
[23998.43s -> 24001.82s]  Uh, that was a wild one. I feel like I fucking
[24002.54s -> 24004.22s]  Had a meltdown
[24004.22s -> 24008.94s]  Accepted the meltdown had another meltdown and then had an end to the stream. That was like three meltdowns in a row
[24009.58s -> 24014.70s]  Wasn't I like when they're like a black and white like i'm smoking on camera routine
[24015.50s -> 24020.22s]  I don't remember any of that
[24020.22s -> 24023.90s]  Almost accidental cock reveal. That's right. What a fucked up stream
[24026.16s -> 24029.76s]  I oh i'm okay. I almost showed my dick on stream
[24032.64s -> 24035.12s]  Let's just be let's call it what it was
[24035.12s -> 24037.12s]  That's unbelievably that's awful
[24038.00s -> 24040.00s]  I'm fucking wearing jeans from now on every stream
[24043.60s -> 24046.64s]  That's fucked up
[24046.64s -> 24048.64s]  No, i'm kidding. It didn't
[24048.88s -> 24052.64s]  I have pants on I have undergarments on i'm kidding
[24053.93s -> 24055.93s]  But like my fly is open
[24055.93s -> 24064.88s]  Just wear I have pants on I was kidding camera got barely below your chest. Yeah, but I didn't know that
[24067.21s -> 24071.93s]  I love it. People just like what is he talking about? What is what the fuck are you talking about?
[24073.31s -> 24074.75s]  Wait
[24074.75s -> 24078.89s]  Is hugh still here?
[24078.89s -> 24082.99s]  I didn't even check
[24082.99s -> 24102.20s]  They're still here. I don't feel too bad about this being over. There are many masterpieces. You never played from the last 30 years
[24102.92s -> 24105.80s]  Yeah, that's true. That's a that's a good way to think about it. It is
[24109.32s -> 24112.76s]  But i'm sad to have like because you know, it's that everybody's into it
[24112.84s -> 24114.84s]  Everybody's trying to piece together the lore and
[24115.63s -> 24116.91s]  everybody's
[24116.91s -> 24119.23s]  So happy about it. I don't know. It just feels cool
[24120.60s -> 24123.88s]  big giant gaming community events like this are always awesome
[24124.76s -> 24128.44s]  seeing like all the gifts and all the people funny ways they've died all the
[24129.53s -> 24131.53s]  Funny stories people have people can tell
[24132.09s -> 24136.00s]  Doesn't happen that often once every like three or four years we get something like this
[24141.71s -> 24143.47s]  So the next stream
[24143.47s -> 24149.02s]  Let's take a look at a calendar here because it's not gonna be tomorrow or today. Whatever
[24151.52s -> 24153.36s]  Um, let's go
[24153.36s -> 24156.08s]  Let's go for tuesday
[24156.08s -> 24160.86s]  tuesday the 5th
[24160.86s -> 24166.17s]  What's your favorite boss?
[24166.17s -> 24167.61s]  uh horror lu
[24167.61s -> 24170.01s]  Let me think
[24170.01s -> 24173.05s]  Uh horror lu slash godfrey is probably my favorite of the whole game
[24173.69s -> 24177.08s]  I could do a tier list eventually here
[24177.98s -> 24181.34s]  total play time 105 hours and 47 minutes
[24189.21s -> 24191.21s]  I think the big centipede
[24191.77s -> 24192.65s]  what
[24192.65s -> 24196.92s]  the void big centipede void thing was really just
[24197.54s -> 24199.54s]  terrifying and awe inspiring
[24199.62s -> 24202.02s]  Probably that one was pretty high astell. Yeah
[24204.65s -> 24206.81s]  rykard was cool, but rykard was kind of a gimmick though
[24207.53s -> 24210.60s]  It was a fun gimmick, but it was still kind of a gimmick
[24213.08s -> 24215.08s]  If I had a top three it'd be horror lu
[24215.48s -> 24218.47s]  astell
[24218.47s -> 24222.92s]  and
[24222.92s -> 24224.52s]  Maybe godric
[24224.52s -> 24226.52s]  Even though I talked a lot of shit
[24227.08s -> 24228.92s]  the music for godric
[24228.92s -> 24232.60s]  It was awesome. The scene where he takes the dragon was really cool
[24236.39s -> 24242.36s]  Mogg was cool
[24242.36s -> 24244.20s]  Favorite non-boss
[24244.20s -> 24248.44s]  Oh, that's right placida placida sax was pretty cool as well. That's right
[24250.70s -> 24253.51s]  Yeah, I would put that in the top five
[24253.51s -> 24255.27s]  It'd be mariner. Yeah
[24255.27s -> 24257.74s]  What about the baseball stream?
[24257.74s -> 24262.70s]  I don't have any updates for you for the baseball stream. I do have a very vague update for you
[24263.74s -> 24266.17s]  That it's going to happen
[24267.64s -> 24269.90s]  probably in
[24269.90s -> 24272.94s]  july
[24272.94s -> 24274.94s]  Couldn't get it done in time
[24276.02s -> 24279.62s]  Uh, so july i'm gonna have a hard date for you probably in the next few weeks
[24281.50s -> 24283.08s]  Um
[24283.08s -> 24285.77s]  Look for a hard date. You'll get it soon
[24288.20s -> 24295.56s]  It'll be in the summer
[24295.56s -> 24298.28s]  It's gonna know it is gonna happen. That's gonna be one of my favorite streams ever
[24303.00s -> 24305.00s]  any updates on grotto beast
[24305.08s -> 24307.08s]  grotto beast is another one of those things that I
[24307.56s -> 24310.12s]  Need to put a lot more of my brain power into
[24312.42s -> 24316.18s]  My brain has been very focused on like one thing the last month
[24317.43s -> 24319.91s]  um
[24319.91s -> 24321.99s]  But yeah, it's also that is still a thing
[24326.30s -> 24328.50s]  Um
[24328.50s -> 24333.22s]  All things ceased to exist while elden ring was a thing. I was kind of afraid of that but
[24333.94s -> 24341.18s]  How many more stream events are we going to have this year?
[24342.23s -> 24344.66s]  I would say at least two
[24344.66s -> 24351.24s]  Baseball is guaranteed and then there might be one more. There might be one more big one. It might be very big
[24351.80s -> 24359.93s]  Good night, everybody
[24359.93s -> 24361.93s]  See you again on tuesday
[24363.80s -> 24365.24s]  4 pm
[24365.24s -> 24366.36s]  pacific
[24366.36s -> 24369.94s]  Take care of yourselves
[24369.94s -> 24375.08s]  Those of you that have been here for the entirety of elden ring
[24375.80s -> 24379.45s]  Thanks for sticking around and uh and going on the journey with me
[24380.25s -> 24385.02s]  Did it before but i'll say it again. Have a great night. I'll see you tuesday
