[0.31s -> 15.20s]  Oh my god, what just- hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[15.44s -> 18.64s]  I'm so confused right now. What the hell just even happened right there?
[18.64s -> 25.86s]  I just shot a spy and he like flipped backwards into a bunch of stuff and like broke all- that was as if I threw him
[25.86s -> 31.44s]  Into a table. What the hell was that? But yeah, Facecam Fortress 2 Mondays edition. How you guys all doing?
[31.44s -> 39.04s]  How you guys having a fantastic Monday? And they're gonna get that first point. No! Zeppelin, you gotta stop him.
[39.04s -> 42.68s]  Me and Zeppelin are gonna drop a friggin' Zeppelin on their heads. Oh
[44.61s -> 55.76s]  No, don't disconnect, please. Please don't disconnect. Please Zeppelin. Here we go. Headshot! Yeah!
[56.40s -> 63.43s]  That's what I like to say. This soldier is a headshot. If I'd waited another second, I wouldn't have had him.
[63.51s -> 70.16s]  Whoa, that was a little bit of laggy lag right there. Not too keen on that.
[72.01s -> 76.68s]  Disp- I think people are just disconnecting left and right here. Hey, I'll use it to my advantage.
[77.80s -> 83.65s]  Oh, that's three in a row. I call that a three in a row. Welcome to hell!
[83.65s -> 93.28s]  I'm actually doing pretty- pretty well right now. Question is, can you keep it going? It's the age-old question right there.
[93.56s -> 105.01s]  That's another headshot. Gotta get that guy. Get him off that point. Get him offa. Damn. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No!
[106.21s -> 113.18s]  That was a pretty good run though. I killed like five or six people. I think they are going to get it, unfortunately.
[115.16s -> 120.75s]  Unfortunately, no. Two soldiers. Oh well. What can you do, right?
[122.40s -> 129.55s]  So today, my drink of choice is a delicious iced tea. Not just any iced tea, it's the pure leaf stuff.
[130.07s -> 137.51s]  If you never had pure leaf, it is probably the best iced tea you could ever drink. And he had to move. He had to move, didn't he?
[138.75s -> 146.19s]  You are stuck in there, my friend. Should have hit him with that. Oh, he's still alive. Oh, and there's a-
[149.72s -> 156.75s]  No, I'm kind of- I'm going to eat a pretzel. I got- Oh, by the way, do you guys reme- Speaking of stuff that I drink and eat and stuff like that,
[156.79s -> 162.84s]  Who remembers these things? Do you remember these things? The pretzels in the box?
[162.84s -> 169.15s]  I remember when I was like five or six years old, I used to eat these every day. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[169.15s -> 172.72s]  They're gonna win. Notify if I have anything to say about it. Oh,
[173.44s -> 185.12s]  chaos. It's just absolute chaos. Oh, I figured I could have done something about that. By the way, these are so stale.
[185.12s -> 191.28s]  I just- I just bit into a piece of white bread. Forget that. Let's go again. Come on.
[191.28s -> 195.43s]  I was- I was on a roll there and I got too busy talking about pretzels and iced tea.
[195.67s -> 197.84s]  But I didn't do
[197.88s -> 204.54s]  shoot. Time to time travel. If you remember what time traveling is,
[204.54s -> 212.56s]  it's when I go like this and we appear at the setup is over. Time travel. The best kind of travel.
[212.56s -> 217.86s]  So let's kill that guy up top or just totally miss him. Either one of those two things
[217.86s -> 225.37s]  I'm happy with, for sure. Walk into it. That sniper right there. Is he gonna have a bad day? Oh, what?
[225.37s -> 236.10s]  I would have headshot him. Oh, things are not looking good right in the beginning here, folks. I knew it.
[237.04s -> 243.58s]  I could see through all the way down into- look at- my arrow is in his scope. That's ridiculous.
[243.78s -> 248.38s]  My arrow was through his scope. Shouldn't that have hit him? Actually, no, it's through the barrel.
[248.46s -> 253.46s]  So technically that's like an eye or like a- no, that's not- that wouldn't be an eye shot.
[253.70s -> 259.06s]  What the HE double honky stick am I talking about? Should have hit him. Should have hit him.
[259.06s -> 265.44s]  Oh, I'm doing all kinds of missing here tonight right here. Not on that guy. I- I
[266.24s -> 271.52s]  Interpreted his movements. I need health though, is that medic? Medic!
[272.68s -> 286.84s]  Medic! Medic! Medic! Medic! No! You! I'll take you on now. I'll take you on now!
[287.32s -> 289.49s]  Let's go! Let's go, man!
[290.21s -> 297.10s]  Oh, give him the old chop chop spike. Oh, I just freaked out. I stole that guy's health so bad.
[297.14s -> 311.63s]  I'll get him this time right here. Right through the trees like a real sniper. Oh, yeah, there it is! There it is!
[311.91s -> 321.80s]  Gotta be careful here. Smart. Smart demo man. You are smart. What is your name? What is that guy's name?
[324.01s -> 327.10s]  Oh my god, that is not a
[328.54s -> 331.29s]  PG name.
[331.85s -> 341.40s]  The best part about Steam is the fact that you can just make your name something just absolutely ludicrous and that's- Spy,
[341.40s -> 345.69s]  what are you doing, man? Is he still alive? I don't know.
[345.69s -> 349.62s]  I would only think you'd do that if you had a dead ringer. Crap!
[350.02s -> 355.09s]  Oh, no! At least he got it. At least one of us is not going to burn to death.
[357.32s -> 362.92s]  Give him the old chop chop. It's the same guy. It's the same like really nice guy.
[366.71s -> 368.71s]  I love how it was that guy and
[368.95s -> 380.60s]  chicken. That killed me. Oh, this guy like xx like- and chicken. Gotta love chicken. Did not mean to click, by the way.
[380.84s -> 387.60s]  That was a misclick. Let's go! At least I killed him. At least I killed-
[389.03s -> 392.55s]  Oh, I gotta- I gotta like relax a little bit here. I'm being a little too crazy.
[393.25s -> 396.29s]  I gotta get- I gotta step back a little bit. Take a breather.
[398.53s -> 405.62s]  Okay, now it's time to bring the headshots back. Time to bring it back to headshot, Phil. And if not,
[406.72s -> 419.16s]  then you know what? What can you do? Headshot. Where- where are these-
[420.10s -> 425.56s]  That guy just came out of nowhere. Oh, this is bad. They're pushing us all the way back.
[426.34s -> 428.74s]  This is really bad. It started off really good, too.
[430.92s -> 446.66s]  Let's go. Me and sellon88. Damn, this is not good. Come on now. That's a spy right there.
[447.76s -> 462.12s]  That is not a spy. I'm so paranoid right now. Where's this other guy? No, I hit him right in
[462.12s -> 471.12s]  the back of the head with the stupid thing. Walk into it. We got a cactus. Get on the point here,
[471.12s -> 482.00s]  fellas. Spy? No. Keep it going here. Keep it going here. Even if I die, you will remember me.
[486.16s -> 493.88s]  Nice, nice. Oh, dude. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Heavy. I didn't realize he had that little health.
[494.64s -> 504.45s]  He had like no health. I have to say sorry. And then sad face. Heavy, I'm sorry. I took that health.
[505.92s -> 510.71s]  We're gonna get it, though. Oh, by the way, speaking of just weird things, I have a hat on
[510.71s -> 517.49s]  today. It is a backwards baker boy. I think I've had this hat on before in previous videos.
[517.49s -> 528.96s]  The vintage baker boy. That's a miss. That's a miss as well. That's- oh man, he got me with such
[528.96s -> 544.21s]  a crazy meat shot right there. Health so bad. I'm gonna die. Oh, get lit. I might have to change
[544.21s -> 548.37s]  here. We might see a change. Huntsman ain't really working so well at this moment in time and
[548.37s -> 568.26s]  history. We got the point, at least. That's a good thing. Get him with that G-Rawdy. That sniper's
[568.26s -> 577.59s]  gunning for me. Good. If I can keep that sniper preoccupied, I'm happy. Oh, man. Nice shot. All
[577.59s -> 583.49s]  right, it's time to change. We gotta change to- we gotta go medic. We need one so bad. All right,
[583.49s -> 590.69s]  let's go, fellas. Let's do a super push here. Except I don't want to get myself killed, so don't
[590.69s -> 594.90s]  go too far away from me or else you're not gonna get healed. No, don't go down. Actually, yeah,
[594.90s -> 602.08s]  go down. Go down. That was a big mistake. Big mistake on my part. I should not have gone anywhere.
[602.08s -> 614.40s]  Are we gonna cap it? Are we gonna win? Oh, get on it. Yes. Oh, we did it. Hooray. Nice job, guys.
[615.33s -> 621.03s]  Good game all around. That's gonna wrap it up here for Face Game Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[621.03s -> 625.80s]  Thank you guys so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. And I will see you guys all next
[625.80s -> 632.13s]  time. Clink. Mm. Take care, everybody.
