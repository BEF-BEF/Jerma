[252.92s -> 259.32s]  Hey what's up everybody? I told you I'd be back and here I am. I gotta say I feel like a new man
[259.32s -> 269.40s]  after the last show. I feel reinvigorated. I feel HD. I feel like German. So I want to give a huge
[269.40s -> 275.08s]  shout out to all the actors that made it to the competition. Unfortunately none of them won.
[275.08s -> 281.08s]  I am still here. I still reign supreme. I want to give a huge shout out to Ludwig. Always good to
[281.08s -> 287.08s]  see him. It was a crazy show. What can I say? But I'm glad I'm still here and I'm glad I'm
[287.08s -> 292.92s]  still with all of you. That number 13 guy though, I don't know what he was thinking. He thought he
[292.92s -> 298.52s]  could take my spot. Instead he kind of showed up just looking like a poor man's Andrew Garfield and
[299.08s -> 305.80s]  good riddance. I don't know too. Like some of his stuff. The Nunchucks? Really? This day and age?
[306.36s -> 311.96s]  And how old was that guy? He looked 25 going on 50. It's like I'm glad you could do a cartwheel
[311.96s -> 320.36s]  but don't break a hip old man you know. So speaking of which, I am a new man. I'm here to do something
[320.36s -> 327.72s]  that I said that I would never do and that's to play Destiny 2. I know I said I'd never do it
[327.72s -> 335.80s]  but here we are and I want to give a big thanks to Ster and Doctor. I want to give a big thanks
[335.80s -> 341.08s]  to the Doctor for showing up. You guys are the best and you help make the magic happen.
[341.64s -> 367.93s]  So let's do it without further ado. Okay we've got here. Looks good. Let me hit launch. Nice.
[373.02s -> 381.99s]  So I hate being forced to do this. This game is just insane but it's big. Sooner or later I guess
[381.99s -> 387.75s]  it had to happen but I gotta tell you I'm not happy about it. Pretty much every fiber of my being is
[387.75s -> 398.78s]  just ugh right now. But gotta make you guys happy so let's go. I mean honestly I'm only doing this
[398.78s -> 403.90s]  because I feel fresh. I mean granted my back hurts after all that breakdancing
[404.70s -> 410.94s]  but I mean I keep telling myself I'm not gonna break dance anymore but you know when you wear
[410.94s -> 430.70s]  a leprechaun pimp outfit that shines like that how can you not bust a move seriously. Here we go.
[430.70s -> 450.04s]  Warp speed. This game takes forever to load. Piece of shit.
[450.60s -> 472.52s]  Control. Dominus cryo. The zones are yours if you fight for them guardian.
[473.80s -> 486.74s]  Okay here we go. What level are these people? That guy's level 459? Enemy claimed zone C. Yeah this is much better with the controller.
[487.46s -> 516.98s]  What's that? Auto isn't here. I'm still on location. You captured zone C. You have zone
[517.46s -> 521.14s]  advantage. Enemy claimed zone B. Enemy claimed zone B.
[523.38s -> 548.66s]  Get some. Yeah baby. Oh platinum trickery. I feel like I kind of look like the moon knight.
[548.66s -> 576.54s]  Zone C lost. Enemy has zone advantage. Bench. Oh I drew a stun. So now I gotta kill that motherfucker
[576.54s -> 594.74s]  twice. Slide attack. I don't even know how to do that.
[602.47s -> 629.88s]  Yes. Race. One for one. Payback to me. Son of a bitch. Aaron! Aaron! What? What was that?
[630.84s -> 644.31s]  Some kind of crystal shield? This game is crazy. Blood.
[657.94s -> 661.72s]  I'm going to kill you if it's the last thing I do with platinum trickery.
[665.93s -> 684.39s]  I wish they would just stay still for a little bit. You know considering how high level some of
[684.39s -> 694.20s]  these people are, I'm not doing as bad as I thought I would. Yes blood for blood. Love to see that.
[694.84s -> 702.26s]  Why do these things have to be so violent?
[710.22s -> 716.62s]  So yeah it was especially great to see the doctor. I haven't seen him in almost three years now.
[718.14s -> 731.34s]  He's been three years? That's crazy. Time just flies by. Time flies by and then someone named
[731.34s -> 756.41s]  Huckababy Brian shoots you in the face. That's life kiddos. He's dying. Turn it into ice cube.
[764.23s -> 766.31s]  Yeah get some. Get some.
[781.85s -> 786.09s]  Get happy. I don't even know what the plot is. It looks like we're just here to turn each other
[786.09s -> 797.21s]  into ice cube. Shoot each other with some kind of bdsm techno knife.
[808.98s -> 823.32s]  What? Just a little bit quicker on the draw. Can anyone hear me? Can anyone hear me? Where am I?
[823.32s -> 839.96s]  It's so cold in here. Hello? Is that the game? Did you guys hear that? I don't know what's talking in this game.
[840.52s -> 852.98s]  Take this without a fight. All right I guess they do talk. All right. You know I think I've died
[852.98s -> 874.41s]  enough. I think I'm gonna relax on the bed. Zone C captured. You have zone advantage.
[875.37s -> 884.63s]  We have zone advantage. Zone C lost. Enemy has advantage. Your enemy has defeated you. What?
[884.71s -> 887.91s]  This is when you have advantage to defeat within four seconds.
[889.03s -> 896.47s]  What is that? You eat monsters for breakfast. You can win a battle for territory. Again.
[903.19s -> 914.82s]  We lost! How much do we lose by? Yeah look at look at that. Combat efficiency.
[916.47s -> 924.47s]  Let's not look at that score again. All right well I think I'm done dying for a little bit.
[924.47s -> 940.78s]  I gotta go use the restroom. I know where I am. I know where I am. I am in the hotel room.
[942.41s -> 1000.76s]  I know. No it doesn't happen. No. I don't know how to do anything else.
[1001.48s -> 1012.36s]  Where am I? I don't even know where I am. I'm in some type of in-between area. I'm gonna haunt
[1012.36s -> 1018.78s]  these motherfuckers for the rest of their lives. I promise I'll haunt them forever.
[1056.17s -> 1060.33s]  Feels like I just got done pissing a sailboat. I don't know what's wrong with me.
[1062.06s -> 1077.50s]  All right let's try this again. This game has some weird audio. All right settings.
[1077.98s -> 1098.09s]  We're ranked seven out of. All right. Dr. Chunk invited us to the clan. That's that must mean
[1098.09s -> 1104.76s]  something good. We're not completely awful. All right well I'm gonna do something a little wild.
[1106.55s -> 1119.56s]  I'm gonna play backwards. Yeah this is how it's done. I can do this with one hand behind my back.
[1119.56s -> 1140.38s]  One hand behind my back. That's the ship. We're taking the ship to war. Hey thank you so much
[1140.38s -> 1155.91s]  for the subs guys. Keep them coming. Let's take the ship. Keep them rolling. So we're guardians?
[1157.70s -> 1167.70s]  What are we guarding? I'm talking to you. Whoa okay that. I'm talking to you right now.
[1168.66s -> 1182.81s]  What? Did you guys hear that on the chat? It's not the game. Number 13. Number 13's not here.
[1194.68s -> 1202.76s]  No beginners here. Yes front desk please. Your team is relying on you. Hi um I've been hearing
[1202.76s -> 1208.68s]  some strange noises in my room. No I didn't. Is there something wrong with the piping or?
[1212.52s -> 1224.89s]  It sounded like a voice. I know it sounds crazy. All right weird question. Has anyone died in here
[1224.89s -> 1261.61s]  recently? I'm sorry guys. I'm hearing a voice that's not in the game. It doesn't sound like that.
[1262.33s -> 1265.93s]  The enemy is ahead but you can change that.
[1268.62s -> 1279.88s]  Okay. He'll never do this boss like he just did. Is there like a ghost in this game or something?
[1280.76s -> 1291.10s]  Chat is there is there a ghost in this game? There's a ghost in your room number 13.
[1291.90s -> 1301.77s]  I'm not number 13. I'm Jerma. I'm just trying to play this game.
[1304.98s -> 1308.02s]  We killed you 13. We killed you.
[1313.06s -> 1318.98s]  Because sometimes you have to grow as a person. You can't always do the same thing.
[1325.32s -> 1334.71s]  Okay guys I'm really getting creeped out right now. He sounds just like me.
[1337.72s -> 1341.45s]  On the plus side at least we won.
[1345.80s -> 1354.28s]  I have this image on the screen. It's a big red pulsating mass. You should probably look at it.
[1355.24s -> 1372.01s]  A pulsating mass? What is that voice? It's getting cold in here.
[1372.65s -> 1386.04s]  People are the horror. It's like someone turned the temperature down in here.
[1390.52s -> 1392.84s]  They don't care they're not freezing. They're just gonna shoot me anyway.
[1401.62s -> 1405.22s]  You've seen their strategy in action. Time to counter.
[1406.02s -> 1423.14s]  I think it's gone now. Guys this is the scariest room I've ever done.
[1424.71s -> 1431.35s]  It doesn't help because I haven't played this game before. I don't think I'll be playing it again.
[1431.35s -> 1443.19s]  I'll tell you that. All right well weird stuff happens. Anyway let's talk about the show huh?
[1444.31s -> 1450.87s]  That was one of the craziest rooms we've ever done. It was a lot of fun. Some of the actors
[1451.67s -> 1458.31s]  phenomenal talents. You've seen those impressions. Time to counter. Some of the musicians
[1458.31s -> 1466.66s]  they needed a little help. Some of it was excellent. Really amazing. Meeting Connor was fun.
[1468.57s -> 1474.04s]  Meeting Connor was an honor. That rhymes. I'm a poet I didn't know it.
[1474.52s -> 1495.29s]  All right. These guys jump. Every time I start to hit somebody they jump.
[1499.21s -> 1513.03s]  That's all right. Stand up and fight again. Combat efficiency zero. Zero. That's one less than one.
[1513.99s -> 1525.24s]  No heavy ammo. Why does ammo have to be heavy? Best serve cold.
[1533.82s -> 1536.09s]  They don't stand a chance.
[1541.16s -> 1547.99s]  I'm not going to show my feet. I'm not going to show my feet. Trust me you don't want to see it.
[1548.87s -> 1553.91s]  Match point. Time to wipe the smugness from your opponent's face. I've got hobbit feet.
[1557.48s -> 1571.74s]  Gangly toenails. Yeah let's try going to a different one. Yeah sneak up on them. It's
[1571.74s -> 1579.86s]  like an office building in the future that's just been torn apart by a warfare. Stop jumping.
[1580.50s -> 1593.99s]  Ah come on. What is this? I'm like glowing.
[1605.67s -> 1615.45s]  I'm not a ghost. This is freaky. I can't wait to get out of this hotel. I don't even know.
[1624.23s -> 1629.58s]  Honestly though I'm lasting longer than I thought I would. That's what she said.
[1632.46s -> 1640.82s]  Triumph completed. Learn from this moment. Learn from this moment. This game sucks.
[1644.66s -> 1653.93s]  Graphics are nice but I want to get killed in three seconds flat like this. Well when I went
[1653.93s -> 1661.32s]  on and on and said I would never play this game now I know why. I'm always right. Even when I'm
[1661.32s -> 1668.36s]  wrong I'm right. Just like the talent show. You could say I was wrong. I didn't let anyone win.
[1669.16s -> 1675.80s]  But you know what? I'm right. Might makes right. Winner winner chicken dinner and who's sitting
[1675.80s -> 1690.79s]  here. Yeah I think we're going to ban that guy that suggested it for an hour. Banned. Ban him.
[1695.03s -> 1701.86s]  So this is the spaceship that just keeps taking me to my doom. Floating there like a high tech one.
[1702.58s -> 1717.29s]  Number 15. I finally was able to have enough energy to go through the first door and
[1717.29s -> 1723.61s]  10 locked doors. Where I can find the key. There's a whole game I'm playing for number 13.
[1724.81s -> 1731.21s]  I'm playing an escape room in purgatory and you better believe I get out of the second door.
[1732.17s -> 1741.00s]  I'll have enough power to do all kinds of other things. I would suggest number 13
[1741.80s -> 1753.42s]  that you leave that. Leave this place and never return. But before you go to number 13.
[1755.99s -> 1762.95s]  If you could possibly look under the bed and see if there's a number because I'm missing the middle
[1762.95s -> 1772.87s]  number in this locked second door and it might be under that. If I do will you leave me alone?
[1773.59s -> 1793.42s]  Oh I will leave you alone. Okay. Is there a number under that good? Number 13. Go chat.
[1793.42s -> 1807.34s]  I feel the chat. They say. Okay. They say. It's one of those shitty hotel room beds. There is no
[1807.34s -> 1815.35s]  number. There's it's just a block under here. There's nothing under here. What? I swear I try.
[1815.75s -> 1825.00s]  There's nothing under here. Dude there has to be a number. I'll look again. There's not a number
[1825.00s -> 1831.99s]  under there. What check? Check the ceiling. Is there any four or five? Just look at the corner
[1831.99s -> 1853.53s]  and the ceiling. These games are so easy. Is there a number in the ceiling? Oh my god. What does it
[1853.53s -> 1867.13s]  say? Yeah. What does it say? I can't believe this. Yeah there was a number.
[1868.86s -> 1878.68s]  7.3? 7.3? What does that mean? 7.3. Okay. All right. Thank you. No I actually really appreciate it.
[1878.68s -> 1885.48s]  Thank you. That that helps you somehow? Yeah. Thank you so much. Just you go back to whatever
[1885.48s -> 1890.36s]  you're doing. You can play that stupid ass game. I am about to solve also say I'm gonna get you
[1890.36s -> 1897.00s]  second at work. Oh thank you so much. Seriously thank you. Glad I could help. But still like
[1897.00s -> 1900.76s]  fuck you and like yeah I'm gonna haunt you for the rest of your life and all you grandkids.
[1902.04s -> 1911.00s]  My grandkids too? Oh my grandkids. I thought I thought if I helped you you wouldn't haunt me.
[1911.88s -> 1913.40s]  You're always going back on your word.
[1918.36s -> 1929.48s]  Is that scary? Yeah. I don't know what I'm gonna do about this. It's actually just kind of fun.
[1929.48s -> 1935.14s]  I think I'm gonna stay like this. Stay in. You know they show up like every week ever maybe.
[1937.16s -> 1942.79s]  Wow. So it's it's fun being a ghost? It's actually pretty cool. You can get you can see any movie ever
[1942.79s -> 1947.11s]  made in the video game you've made. It's actually really awesome. I'll bet ghost is popular.
[1947.83s -> 1952.47s]  And you can keep this shit. This this real world shit it's it's no good.
[1954.06s -> 1962.38s]  No it's fun. You're you're in a lot of trouble. If it's fun to haunt too. It's funny I can chase
[1962.38s -> 1967.74s]  people like the people I can like hide in a chaining and be like Santa Claus and stuff.
[1968.70s -> 1974.50s]  It's really relatable. That does sound fun. Do you like watch people make out and stuff?
[1975.38s -> 1980.50s]  No. I don't know why that's the first thing I thought of it. No. What? Yeah no I'm like that.
[1981.94s -> 1985.14s]  I guess I was like if I was a ghost it might be one of the first things I do.
[1988.22s -> 1995.75s]  Well I'm losing power. I'm losing power. I wish you luck but it sounds like you don't. No no no.
[1996.55s -> 1999.03s]  Thanks for the number dude but there are a lot of children when I get
[1999.03s -> 2005.53s]  when I get more power you're you're lost. You took everything from me even though it's really
[2005.53s -> 2011.05s]  actually not that bad. And I'm gonna haunt you for the rest of your life. You better run
[2011.05s -> 2024.50s]  and you better never you better never look back. Okay uh so no no no yeah I'm out I'm out this has
[2024.50s -> 2030.10s]  been too weird guys. Sorry. Fucked up game. Fucked up ghosts. I'm out of here.
