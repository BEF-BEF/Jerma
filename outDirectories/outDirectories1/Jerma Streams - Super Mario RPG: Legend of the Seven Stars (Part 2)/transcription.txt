[0.95s -> 22.04s]  Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello? What's up? Who is this? Who's this? You called me. Oh, okay. Yeah.
[22.76s -> 32.57s]  Yeah, yes, my number is one number off of your number. Okay, cool. That's really great. Um,
[32.57s -> 42.02s]  that makes me happy. Okay, please never call me again. Goodbye. Great. That was fun. It's
[42.02s -> 58.52s]  seven o'clock in the fucking morning. You guys never heard of that? I know it's not. I was doing
[58.92s -> 66.57s]  a bit. I was doing a routine. There was a big spotlight on me and I had the mic in my hand
[67.38s -> 73.83s]  and the house lights are down. Spotlight, bang. I go into my bit, my performance. No clapping.
[73.83s -> 81.54s]  Don't, no clapping. House lights come down. Bang, spotlight. Here we go. I'm going. Oh,
[81.54s -> 93.93s]  let's clap. I can't. We're not clapping. No, he's just going. Okay. See what I mean? Let's go.
[94.65s -> 99.88s]  All right. Get it back on. Get it back on. I'm not ready yet. You can clap.
[100.52s -> 110.71s]  You can clap. So today we're going to do Mario RPG again. We're going to do Terraria
[111.80s -> 123.82s]  tonight, but Star and I could not sync up good. We had our days mixed up, apparently. I thought
[123.82s -> 128.78s]  we were doing it Monday. Apparently we had that wrong, I guess. I thought I thought I said Monday,
[128.78s -> 135.83s]  but whatever. It's all right. It's all good. So we're going to do that probably a different day
[136.47s -> 142.07s]  or Terraria is kind of just cursed. So it seems like every time something happens,
[143.69s -> 149.37s]  like Star's computer breaks like three weeks ago and then two weeks ago, my internet like doesn't
[149.37s -> 160.66s]  work at all. And then we mix our days up this time. Let's just pretend we beat the moon boss.
[163.45s -> 169.46s]  There he is. Is he here? I thought it was a different day. No, it's fine. It don't matter.
[172.10s -> 175.86s]  I mean, I did, I mean, I, you know, I did clearly if you scroll up in the PMs,
[175.86s -> 180.49s]  I did clearly say Monday. And if you scroll up in those PMs,
[186.04s -> 191.80s]  he's fucking so mad. No, it's all good. Terraria is just like a relaxing, fun game to play. Anyways,
[196.25s -> 208.73s]  here comes another year long joke. Release the email. It's all good. But so what we're going to
[208.73s -> 216.38s]  do is just because we couldn't, I wanted to start around like 334. So I didn't want to have another
[216.38s -> 221.42s]  scenario where it's like, oh, let's set a 30 minute, 40 minute setup time because Terraria
[221.42s -> 232.50s]  multiplayer fucking doesn't work half the time. But we love Star. We do. But we also love Super
[232.50s -> 240.10s]  Mario as well. We'll do something someday. Maybe tomorrow. No, not tomorrow. Maybe like
[241.06s -> 248.34s]  next weekend. No, we should start. No, we should actually do. We should just get to the end
[249.51s -> 255.75s]  of Terraria and just turn the stream on and have the last base game boss have one HP left.
[255.75s -> 260.50s]  And then just be like, like fucking screaming and stuff that we did it. And then just move
[260.50s -> 273.00s]  on to our own game and then end the streams. Oh God. Anyways, I'm going to pick up what we
[273.00s -> 277.24s]  left off yesterday on Super Mario RPG legend of the seven stars. I got voices.
[278.46s -> 285.88s]  The throat is voiced. My throat is lubricated. It's well rested. He's starting his tuber voice.
[285.88s -> 291.77s]  That's how you know it's ready to start the let's play continuation. We have five of them.
[292.73s -> 315.67s]  And they're distinct. I'll prove it to you. Oh, that's four. Hold on. This one. This one. This one.
[316.70s -> 326.34s]  This one. And this one. There you go. You got five distinct voices. Told you.
[326.98s -> 341.62s]  All right. So we left off. We got the princess. Princess join the party.
[345.82s -> 355.37s]  We now have to go unravel the mysteries of, uh, I don't know. I've played this game a thousand
[355.37s -> 359.93s]  times. I don't fucking remember what happens next. All right. We go through to marry more.
[360.65s -> 368.30s]  We go to booster's pass. First of all, because something happened here last time. You can't do
[368.30s -> 374.26s]  the Malo voice because you don't use Malo. Yes, I can. I didn't say five distinct currently on
[374.26s -> 392.62s]  camera voices. I just said just five distinct voices. Oops. I fell down. We want Malo. Well,
[392.62s -> 401.02s]  Malo is not in the, you know what, for the first time ever, I may replace genome. It's possible.
[401.02s -> 410.50s]  I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Here we go. Come on. Let's bring out a sixth. Golly,
[410.50s -> 416.49s]  you're that famous Mario. Nope. Golly, you're that famous Mario guy. If I beat you,
[416.49s -> 426.71s]  they'll make me sniff at number four. If I'm lucky. Here we go. You ain't going to be sniffed at
[426.71s -> 444.41s]  number four. You're going to be sniffed at number six feet under. Well, now they'll make me take
[444.41s -> 468.10s]  the training course over again. Slow down. Okay. Flower tab. Broad coin. Kero Kero Cola. Got it.
[468.10s -> 475.45s]  I got the secret. I got the secret. Oh, Mario just fell off the base of the earth. All right,
[475.45s -> 483.45s]  let's go. I think there's something else you can do here. There's something else on booster's
[483.45s -> 487.61s]  path that I don't want to miss. It is like a training course, but is it over here? Where is
[487.61s -> 501.56s]  it? This is that way, but I can't keep going that way. I forget where it is. You have to
[501.56s -> 507.88s]  scale a mountain. Let me check that over here one more time. I think, let me follow up the other
[507.88s -> 526.50s]  side. Like this. Nope. Hey Jerm, I was watching your last stream. Could you maybe cut back on
[526.50s -> 534.18s]  the ha ha entertainer joke? Please laugh. Jokes, please. Then you what? Ha ha entertainer jokes?
[534.18s -> 547.00s]  Laugh, please laugh jokes? What the fuck does that mean? I don't even know what that means.
[547.64s -> 559.82s]  The laugh, please laugh jokes. I don't know what the fuck that means. All right. What was
[559.82s -> 573.53s]  the last thing I just did? Let me try to remember. We got the princess. Oh, we got to talk to the
[573.53s -> 590.70s]  frog fusions. Okay. Oh, let me check from frog coins. May I help you? Uh, no. Where's the frog
[590.78s -> 596.30s]  coin guy? Welcome to the frog coin emporium. I got 15 frog coins. I'm not going to use any of these
[597.42s -> 600.94s]  because you can get accessories later that are really, really good. Hold on. Let's see if
[600.94s -> 612.28s]  Todofsky has anything. My favorite song is the Bolville Miner's song. Oh, me do so. I have a
[612.28s -> 625.74s]  picture. This is my phone. I'm going to get the next layer of card. Me do so do re la ti do.
[626.54s -> 639.26s]  All right, let's get that up. Where is it? Remind chat of September. What is that? What the hell is
[639.26s -> 652.81s]  September? I think I have to take a photo of this. Me do so do. Whatever that is. To me,
[652.81s -> 661.45s]  this is the me do so do re la ti do is more important. Hold on. Me do so do re la ti do.
[662.01s -> 669.96s]  When are you ever going to do an experimental no talking stream?
[671.56s -> 676.60s]  A hundred of you would watch that. I'm not going to do that. All right. Me do so do re la ti do.
[676.60s -> 684.28s]  Got it? And then I have the image there. Let's do it. Okay, September. It's half off of all subs.
[686.02s -> 699.34s]  Really? Oh, all right. Okay. What do you mean half off? How does it make sense? What the
[699.34s -> 708.30s]  fuck was that? What the hell is that? My phone just like did a different noise. It's never done
[708.30s -> 724.81s]  this noise. All right. No, that's good. All right. So you want a music lesson from me? No, I don't.
[724.81s -> 730.63s]  All right. I got it. Oh no, I'm supposed to keep my phone open. Did my phone overheat because I had
[730.63s -> 736.23s]  the image on for too long? This is the third year it's happened. How do you not know this?
[736.23s -> 740.87s]  I don't know because it's only like one month out of a year three times. This only happened three
[740.87s -> 753.11s]  times. Look. Me do so do re la ti do is more important. Please laugh at that. All right.
[755.21s -> 762.82s]  Do re mi. This is the last one. Okay. Me do which is right in the middle.
[763.54s -> 799.22s]  Me do so. So it's do do ti la so fa do re la so that's do ti la so fa do ti la do do ti
[802.41s -> 806.82s]  do. All right. This is it. What do you think, Todofsky? I did a pretty good job. I think.
[814.71s -> 817.83s]  Hey man, did you have a mental breakdown? A long time ago you said you'd only play this on stream
[817.83s -> 832.87s]  if you had a mental breakdown. Did I actually say that? I got a tenner card. Wait, why did I
[832.87s -> 847.83s]  say that? I said I would only play this game if I had a mental breakdown on stream? Well,
[847.83s -> 854.65s]  yeah, you can count Simpsons hit and run. That makes sense. Yeah, nothing wrong with that.
[854.65s -> 861.77s]  All right. I got my card. We have the next level of stolen music from this guy.
[861.77s -> 874.82s]  All right. Mario tennis counts. No, I'm okay with that. A tenner card holder, huh? What'll it be?
[876.31s -> 883.35s]  Oh, we get mega elixirs now. The whole party recovers 150. That's a lot of money.
[890.90s -> 894.50s]  All right. Let's go talk to Frogfuture so I'm ready for one of my distinct voices.
[894.50s -> 913.29s]  I have the latest news, children. A large star has been sighted on Star Hill. In other news,
[915.24s -> 944.22s]  the sky is fucking blue. Why are you coming to me? Sorry, Grandpa. Here we go. Star Hill.
[945.02s -> 960.44s]  This place is cool. I get a lot of claymation vibes from this place. To marry more and then
[960.44s -> 964.84s]  talk to the flower and the flower, if you talk to the flower, a gate will open. This one is to Star
[964.84s -> 981.21s]  Hill. Here we go. I still haven't figured out how I want him to sound. I have to figure it out now
[981.21s -> 991.51s]  because we're getting to the top of the roller coaster here. This is Star Hill. No. Watch out
[991.51s -> 1000.23s]  for the lizard behind you. Behind you. This is Star Hill. No, that sounds terrible. This is Star
[1000.23s -> 1021.86s]  Hill. No, this is Star Hill. No, this is Star Hill. No, this, this, this, this, this is Star Hill.
[1022.82s -> 1029.67s]  Wishes which were transformed at the Star Road fall from here, but some wishes that haven't
[1029.67s -> 1037.98s]  been granted yet are falling because Smitty destroyed the Star Road. I have to do the anime
[1038.06s -> 1054.14s]  voice. What else am I supposed to do? I'm combining them all for that character. You're
[1054.14s -> 1071.08s]  getting all five in that character alone. Oh, it's Otto. No, I don't want to hurt Otto. Just these
[1071.08s -> 1093.35s]  things. Migraine. I think Migraine is an instant kill. Just do text to speech. That's, all right,
[1093.91s -> 1107.67s]  why do we have to, that did one damage and I didn't even block it. That's not very nice. These little
[1107.67s -> 1110.79s]  guys though, I do want to attack because I think they give you stuff. They drop stuff.
[1111.43s -> 1119.43s]  Say the same thing twice. I think I actually kind of like this Virginia. Yeah, I'm going to stick
[1119.43s -> 1146.42s]  with this one. No, don't let them run. Don't let them get away. These guys drop items. 30 bucks.
[1147.14s -> 1159.88s]  That's what I'm talking about. Go all the way around, touch this one.
[1162.68s -> 1169.03s]  What about the little star? Look at that emote. That is such a cute little emote, isn't it?
[1169.83s -> 1180.79s]  If I could just get that melody. If you could just get the melody.
[1184.25s -> 1201.85s]  The hunger. Oh, for some food. Not creepy. What do stars eat? I want to be evolved class Baker.
[1202.49s -> 1208.98s]  Have you figured it out yet? Have you figured it out yet, class?
[1209.94s -> 1225.43s]  I want to be the best treasure hunter in the world. Yes, these are wishes from the people down below.
[1226.15s -> 1251.75s]  Did it really take? Come on. Figured it out. I got it. I want to be the best treasure. Who's the
[1251.75s -> 1259.78s]  best? Who is that? I'm not even sure who that's supposed to be. I wonder what character that is.
[1260.66s -> 1273.11s]  The hunger. That's probably, that's, uh, Valom. What's my wish? Um, I can't tell you because then
[1273.11s -> 1287.91s]  it won't come true. Where's this other stupid flower? Please let Malo find his way home.
[1289.66s -> 1300.49s]  Why, this wish is, wait, wait, this wish is, it's from my mom and dad. They're wishing for me to come
[1300.49s -> 1316.76s]  home. This is not the time to be crying. They're waiting for me to come home. Come on, Mario. We've
[1316.76s -> 1327.22s]  got a busy schedule. I'll make you eat dust if you don't hurry. What? Is that what he said? What did
[1327.22s -> 1351.98s]  he say? Did I say that wrong? Is dust like dirt? Like berry? I'm going to make you eat dust. Who's
[1351.98s -> 1379.61s]  this one? Wish I could run faster. I hope I become famous. It's mine. Shh, don't tell anybody. So
[1379.61s -> 1385.05s]  the one problem with Mario, this is the only issue that most people have with this game, is this is
[1385.05s -> 1393.91s]  just a free star. You don't have to do anything. This is kind of the padding. This is the filler
[1393.91s -> 1409.64s]  episode of this game. It is a cool stage though. Yeah, it is. Hey, look at that. Only three more
[1409.64s -> 1426.46s]  to go. And one could say this is the end of the, yeah, the merry more arc. You've come a long way,
[1426.46s -> 1440.78s]  but your journey is not over. There are three more star pieces. We're good. I want to be a great
[1440.78s -> 1458.12s]  plumber like my brother Mario. Luigi, I'm sorry, but you'll never be as good as me. You'll always
[1458.12s -> 1475.75s]  be second best. I'm just being realistic. You know, come on. Luigi, how many games have you had?
[1476.87s -> 1486.25s]  One, two. I've had like 38. You need to have 36 more games under your belt before you're going
[1486.25s -> 1501.98s]  to be able to fix his toilets like I can. What's going on here? Apologize. I'm sorry, Luigi. There.
[1511.08s -> 1529.69s]  That's a family guy joke? How is that a family guy joke? I'm just a customer. Don't tell me
[1529.69s -> 1544.26s]  you want supplies. I know. Wait, I made fun of Luigi, therefore I was a family guy joke?
[1547.90s -> 1552.54s]  No, I didn't know how the rules were. I'm sorry. All right, bad mush poisons an enemy,
[1553.75s -> 1565.69s]  a Muku cookie, Fright Bomb, Fire Bomb, and Ice Bomb. These are really good, but they're way too
[1565.69s -> 1580.94s]  expensive. Ice Bomb is crazy. I think it does like over two or three hundred damage. I don't know
[1580.94s -> 1601.48s]  what this does. You owe us a Peter. No, I don't. At all, actually. So thank you very much. In the
[1601.48s -> 1613.26s]  middle of the ocean is a pirate ship. You'll find, I mean, there's a pirate lives there. His name
[1613.90s -> 1628.06s]  is Jonathan Jones. He isn't very nice. A star has fallen into the sea. The pirate, probably.
[1631.72s -> 1657.14s]  I mean, that man, Jonathan Jones, probably has it. He's nasty. This is the inn. You may stay for free.
[1659.78s -> 1710.31s]  Thanks. Okay. I'm scared. Check your money. You may stay for free. Outpass. Okay. Wait,
[1711.03s -> 1728.71s]  this one already. It's like a cat. Kavir, you're collecting stars, right? Only three more to go.
[1740.41s -> 1752.01s]  If you want to enter the ocean, jump into the whirlpools. You will find the village elder
[1752.01s -> 1805.61s]  in his house. He is the most respected person here. I'm spinning. I'm spinning. Finally, it took you
[1805.61s -> 1812.74s]  long enough. I am the elder of this village. I got to my exalted station in life by
[1813.86s -> 1822.15s]  pleasing my superiors, which is something I do well. A star has fallen into the ocean. I need it
[1823.10s -> 1836.47s]  for a certain purpose. You must find it for me. You'll find the star in Jonathan Jones' territory.
[1837.56s -> 1844.26s]  Don't worry. You can beat him. At least I think you can. Hurry and bring back the star.
[1855.61s -> 1862.49s]  Hello there. You're Mario, right? You remember me? We met at Tadpole Pond, but I'm still at Tadpole.
[1863.30s -> 1867.38s]  I've graduated from Frogfusious's school, and now I'm searching for the meaning of life.
[1868.26s -> 1876.95s]  It's been so quiet around here. It's almost eerie. Is something going on? It probably doesn't
[1876.95s -> 1894.95s]  concern me. Well, if you got any frog coins, I've got some neat items to sell you. There we go.
[1894.95s -> 1901.93s]  Doubles experience when equipped, doubles the coins you win in battle, and cuts FP use in half
[1901.93s -> 1909.18s]  during a fight. This also is you can use this to start a fight over or allows you to always run
[1909.18s -> 1917.45s]  away from a battle. This one is awesome. This one is probably this is the probably best ring in the
[1917.45s -> 1930.50s]  game, but it's 50 frog coins. Realistically, I could probably get one of these. I definitely
[1930.50s -> 1939.22s]  don't want to do this, though. Go farm the Midas River. I could, but I don't think I'm gonna do
[1939.22s -> 1948.66s]  that. It's a cool character, though. Be careful up here, by the way. Do you have like a stick or
[1948.66s -> 1960.26s]  something? Can I give you like a symbol? These people here are dangerous. Look at them. Oops.
[1960.26s -> 1973.51s]  I think I can get in there eventually. All right, I think I'm good. I have the latest equipment. What
[1973.51s -> 1982.79s]  do I have for items? I have too many honey syrups. All right, I'm gonna use these as well. All
[1982.79s -> 1987.75s]  right, I gotta do some, I gotta, I gotta, I have to get rid of this shit. I need some mushrooms.
[1988.55s -> 1993.85s]  How many mushrooms do I have? I need more stuff. Hold on. I'm gonna have to go to the town and get
[1993.85s -> 2006.89s]  some stuff because these guys won't sell me shit. I do have so much stuff, but I just need to get
[2006.89s -> 2019.64s]  rid of it. No, who sells you? No, who sells? You sell. Bad mushroom? No, I have to go to a different
[2019.64s -> 2040.17s]  town. There was a Super Mario manga for a bit. Was there really? That seems weird. All right,
[2040.17s -> 2048.81s]  let's get some stuff. Uh, Wart Club, we already have everything that's the best. I need some mid
[2048.81s -> 2054.33s]  mushrooms, though. And I'm gonna sell, I have to sell them. They're taking up so much stupid space.
[2055.86s -> 2062.57s]  Honey syrups are just dog shit now. I could get, I could, look at how much you could get for that.
[2063.53s -> 2080.70s]  Bucky Jewel, I know I could use that and I could, uh, I had to. These, these are, oh shit, panic
[2080.70s -> 2086.95s]  buttons. I still have a Yoshi cookie. All right, I'm gonna get another, I'm gonna get a maple syrup.
[2087.75s -> 2102.20s]  Yeah, two maple syrups. That sounds good to me. Whatever happens happens. I should be fine. Let's
[2102.20s -> 2115.37s]  go to the sea. This is time to go find the star that's apparently down here. Oh, there he is.
[2116.09s -> 2130.55s]  It's been a while since people came around here. Oh fuck, look at all this. I don't have any money.
[2133.43s -> 2147.29s]  Super hammer, pearly gloves, handgun I already have. Oh no, how much can I get if I take off?
[2147.29s -> 2163.13s]  Hold on. All right, if I, if I get rid of the happy shirt, get rid of the happy cape, keep the
[2163.13s -> 2170.68s]  amulet. The work pants are always good. What if I get rid of the jump shoes? All right, I'm gonna
[2170.68s -> 2174.74s]  sell those two and see if I can afford any of them. I'll be able to come back and afford it later.
[2179.26s -> 2186.86s]  Happy shirt, happy cape, buy sailor shirt, sailor cape. All right, we can get Mario's shirt.
[2192.71s -> 2200.94s]  I'm not gonna have to come back for Gino's shirt. The ship sank into the briny sea because a giant
[2200.94s -> 2213.18s]  squid attacked it. Some people went in to survey it, but they never came back. Weird. Sailor shirt.
[2213.74s -> 2228.97s]  All right, you'll be fine. Giant octopus. Never came back. I'll come back. This is,
[2228.97s -> 2232.97s]  I believe there is a star right here, so I've got to be ready for this.
[2234.09s -> 2256.98s]  More, more, more, more, more. Oh, Mario's level nine. You know what to do. This is in your hands.
[2263.46s -> 2281.91s]  Please click on the screen where you'd like me to put the points in. Have fun with it. Power,
[2281.91s -> 2308.01s]  power, power, power, power. Okay, I think that's all I need to see. Power it is. 55 to 57 and then
[2308.01s -> 2319.75s]  27 to 28 defense. What am I gonna do? We got another one. Gino. Gino got a good HP increase.
[2319.75s -> 2336.81s]  Yeah, very good. Pretty much crossed the board, everything. Choose wisely. A continuous speedrun
[2336.81s -> 2344.02s]  the next day is against the rules. All right, guys, that's it for tonight. I'll see you tomorrow
[2344.02s -> 2358.76s]  where I pick up at 42 minutes and 12 seconds. That's funny. All right, uh, we're going with
[2358.76s -> 2372.31s]  Magic. 40, 41, 24, 25. Anybody else? Wow, I think the whole, uh, the whole entire group leveled up,
[2372.31s -> 2382.65s]  I believe. Malo's creeping up on Gino, but look at his HP. It's terrible. He'll get one hit killed
[2382.65s -> 2406.73s]  and half the encounters late game. Potentially a decent choice. I do love the dancing flowers,
[2410.97s -> 2422.66s]  though. What's the actual meta for this game? I have no idea. Not a single group. Guys, I just
[2422.66s -> 2426.74s]  press buttons. I don't know what they do. I'm actually surprised I've been able to do this with
[2426.74s -> 2445.24s]  my eyes closed for this long. Toadstool has reached level 10. Look at that magic. Gino, Toadstool,
[2445.24s -> 2453.48s]  and Malo, I believe, have the highest damage for Magic. Why am I not playing Classic? Wow,
[2453.48s -> 2460.47s]  I have Warf- I have Warf- I have reference, not Warference. I have reference Warcraft every stream.
[2470.33s -> 2478.23s]  Because I- I don't know. I'm not playing it. Maybe I will. Guys, you never go
[2479.27s -> 2486.74s]  to the new attraction the day it opens. I don't want to wait in line for four hours
[2487.69s -> 2493.37s]  to ride the new Galaxy's Edge ride. I'm gonna go when everybody doesn't give a shit anymore,
[2493.37s -> 2498.09s]  and I can stay in the hotel for fucking three nights for the same price as one night right now.
[2498.73s -> 2523.51s]  Thank you for voting. 45 and 31. You're gonna stay in the hotel when it's not cool anymore.
[2523.51s -> 2527.67s]  Yeah, it's- what do you mean it's not cool anymore? It's cool to like me, my two sons,
[2528.55s -> 2535.59s]  my wife, and our gran- and my grandfather. Well, I don't care. I don't give a shit how- how cool
[2535.59s -> 2549.30s]  it is. It's cool to us. Found the secret room, by the way. I- hold on. Important. I'm about to get
[2549.30s -> 2559.58s]  destroyed. I do. Oh no no no no no no no no no what did I do? What did I do? What did I do?
[2561.29s -> 2572.12s]  No shit. No I got baited. I got baited. I wasn't supposed to do this. No. And I just saved it
[2572.12s -> 2595.62s]  right here. It's the only save I have. Did I get- how much money did I make? Not enough. Thank you,
[2595.62s -> 2603.99s]  drop by again. All right, I'm- that wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be. In fact, that was
[2603.99s -> 2609.91s]  not a big deal at all. I just overreacted. I reacted harder for you, okay? That was a lot of
[2609.91s -> 2617.51s]  reactions. The reason why I did that is because over here, there is one of these things that-
[2617.51s -> 2623.83s]  never mind. I had it incorrect. I was wrong, and I will stand by my correction that I did- I thought
[2623.83s -> 2639.29s]  it was a different part of the game. It was just some free stuff, and that's it. But I want to get
[2639.29s -> 2648.98s]  up there. Oh, I get there. I know you can like get sucked up there somehow. I didn't want to do that
[2648.98s -> 2665.45s]  either. Yes I did. I want to come up. Got a max mushroom. Let's get rid of one of our honey syrups
[2666.49s -> 2680.26s]  because these things are stupid. Should I fight it? Hold on. I think there's stuff over here.
[2680.82s -> 2690.73s]  Isn't there something here? I always thought there was something over here. This- I- I remember this
[2690.73s -> 2696.18s]  part. This part sucks because you can only breathe- you can only be underwater for 30 seconds before
[2696.18s -> 2699.46s]  you start to drown. So you have to keep- there's like oxygen pockets and shit.
[2701.66s -> 2706.30s]  I'm just kidding. There's a page from the travelogue. Let's take a look. It looks boring.
[2707.99s -> 2716.47s]  Here's the thing. I know the password already. I've known the password for 15 years. So there's a
[2716.47s -> 2722.63s]  password. I don't even need to know any of these things. We've managed to trap the giant squid in
[2722.63s -> 2727.43s]  the treasure cellar. The treasure will sink with the ship, but so it goes. There's a big password
[2727.43s -> 2731.35s]  you have to figure out. I already know what it is. So I'm sorry to all the people that are like
[2731.35s -> 2735.75s]  waiting for me to deduce this password. It took me a while to figure this out when I was 12,
[2736.55s -> 2741.90s]  but ever since then it's been burned in my brain. I don't need to do anything else. I'm more- well
[2741.90s -> 2745.58s]  we'll just- we'll just- I'll just pretend, right? We'll do- I'm gonna do like a YouTube let's play
[2745.58s -> 2755.66s]  here. What are you done for? A giant squid's got a hold of us. The ship's going down fast.
[2757.72s -> 2760.20s]  No, I gotta save that one. I gotta save that voice for the actual pirate.
[2760.68s -> 2771.19s]  The door to the cellar is locked with a password consisting of six letters. In order to proceed,
[2771.19s -> 2779.18s]  you'll have to decipher the password using the six hints. By the way, the password is pearls.
[2779.18s -> 2792.41s]  I win. Oh fuck, this must be a YouTube let's play. Sorry guys. Uncover the secret of the six hints,
[2792.41s -> 2797.45s]  of course, since they're provided by different people. That'd be pretty tough to solve. Maybe
[2797.45s -> 2814.34s]  even impossible. Mm-hmm, little secret. He's bad at tubing. I don't think he can be good at tubing.
[2816.44s -> 2824.74s]  You just lie down on it and jump into the snow and then you scream and just pray. Okay, um,
[2825.62s -> 2857.46s]  let's go. They're scared. Willy wisp. 40 fucking damage. See, Malo would be dead.
[2858.26s -> 2883.05s]  He would really only take one of those and then be gone. Damn, he was dead. This guy sucks.
[2888.79s -> 2899.35s]  Ooh, Bowser level 10. Pretty good increases all around. Oh, Gino doesn't have any armor on. Oh yeah,
[2899.35s -> 2904.63s]  that's right. Oh right, you're right. You are right. Completely correct on that. Gino is not wearing
[2904.63s -> 2911.86s]  armor. Um, I have to go back and buy the sailor cape. Thank you for reminding me, but I can't
[2911.86s -> 2938.65s]  afford it yet. Who gives the most money? Wow, 76% of you guys. Really? That's, I mean, yeah, I guess.
[2938.65s -> 2945.45s]  He is really strong. There's a problem here though. Um, two of the people in this current party,
[2946.33s -> 2956.25s]  you're only giving power to. Mario and Bowser have not great HP and not good magic damage or defense.
[2956.81s -> 2965.10s]  Only Gino does. So, and Gino is not wearing armor. You guys might have screwed this all up. I'm just
[2965.10s -> 2984.20s]  saying. Here we go. Coins. How much money do I have now? 136. I need like 200, 300.
[2984.76s -> 3016.09s]  Ah, let's just get this over with. Didn't kill them. How? Shit. Come on. How are you doing less
[3016.09s -> 3027.16s]  damage than Gino? This motherfucker is naked. Here's a Gino again. Bye. He's dead. He has one health.
[3027.96s -> 3046.01s]  He'll be fine. Look, 110 damage. These guys have a lot of armor too. Once again, that's fine. Run
[3046.01s -> 3071.85s]  away. I'm looking for about 200 coins. That's three. That's not 200. Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, okay.
[3071.85s -> 3106.57s]  I gotta actually stop fucking around. Got it. No. Oh, don't do it again. Not on Mario. No.
[3109.35s -> 3116.87s]  Mario sucks. Laughing my ass off. No, Mario did this very good. Done. Good. Once again,
[3117.90s -> 3121.50s]  I'll take Lucky because that might be coins and you guys will pick. I promise.
[3121.66s -> 3140.50s]  16 damage on a block. What the hell are you talking about? What the fuck just happened?
[3140.50s -> 3150.31s]  He's got no armor. He doesn't have any fucking clothes on. Oh, everything's fine. Don't run.
[3150.31s -> 3173.61s]  100. There we go. Okay. So we've got six coins. Chance to double your coins. Let's do it. You're
[3173.61s -> 3181.75s]  ready? Give it all you got. Follow it. Okay. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me.
[3181.75s -> 3187.67s]  Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Why am I not using the scan line filters? Because they make
[3187.67s -> 3213.00s]  me throw up. That's a pretty big amount. That's a 47% think it's over here. I really hope the
[3213.00s -> 3219.32s]  14% of you that clicked on G-Node actually that you didn't know where it was because that's a lot
[3219.32s -> 3226.44s]  of percentages. So here we go. Let's do it. You guys say the left and you are correct.
[3227.24s -> 3234.68s]  That is 12 coins. 15 EXP. No, I wanted to get away so I could heal. Okay. This is bad.
[3235.56s -> 3243.80s]  This is really bad. Give me a chance. Gino has no fucking armor on. Okay. Basu, you have to stay
[3243.80s -> 3289.70s]  alive. Run. Actually run away. You got away. Good. Oh my shit. That was fucking lucky. Okay.
[3289.70s -> 3306.14s]  All right. Now let's go back and get Gino's outfit. It's going to be 300 something damage.
[3307.02s -> 3318.23s]  No. These guys take a lot of damage. But they obviously are very hard to kill. Time that wrong.
[3329.43s -> 3332.95s]  No, I forgot. You have to kill them with magic. I remember now.
[3334.15s -> 3349.42s]  I remember. Yep. They only die from magic. Go on Mario. Go ahead. Gino sucks.
[3350.38s -> 3353.98s]  No, he doesn't have any. He's not wearing any armor. That's why he's not very good.
[3354.86s -> 3367.48s]  Okay. Let's go back to the merchant and let's get what we need to get.
[3374.90s -> 3384.34s]  This is who you guys want in Smash. Yes. And I turned my head slightly over my shoulder a little
[3384.34s -> 3391.86s]  and my face is bright red. Yes. Like I am embarrassed that he's being he's doing not doing so well.
[3399.86s -> 3411.62s]  Okay. Sailor cape. I have the sailor shirt. I now want the hurly gloves. This is for Bowser.
[3412.34s -> 3417.10s]  I already got the handgun. Super hammer is the super hammer. Hurly gloves are better.
[3417.74s -> 3426.17s]  Are they than the chomp? I don't remember. I think they are. We'll find out. Hurly gloves. Oh yeah.
[3426.17s -> 3442.31s]  They are sailor cape. Finally Gino won't die instantly. Okay. So I'm going to sell the chomp
[3442.31s -> 3449.03s]  and I'm going to get the how much is this? 107. You guys are going to love the hurly gloves.
[3449.83s -> 3461.70s]  Oh nice. Is the super hammer as good as the masher or worse? I don't remember.
[3467.83s -> 3489.03s]  I'm going to find out. Damn it. It is worse than the masher. Okay. All right. Now I'm going to
[3489.91s -> 3496.23s]  pick me ups. Get another one. Get another one. Sell items. In fact, you know what? No, no, no,
[3496.47s -> 3502.63s]  take it. Take it. Use the flower jar like for the love of God. What are you? That stupid, stupid
[3502.63s -> 3515.77s]  idiot. Jeremy, what are you? Dumb person. I need to use this during a boss fight. If I use this
[3515.77s -> 3520.73s]  during a boss fight, it guarantees a luck. It guarantees one of those, uh, the three eggs of
[3520.73s -> 3525.85s]  Yoshi. It's going to be a lot on the line. So if I use this at a boss fight, I hope you guys are
[3525.85s -> 3535.51s]  ready to really truly try and pick the right one. That leaves me room to do a couple more mid mushrooms.
[3538.42s -> 3551.43s]  I have to trust you guys. I do. Let's do two more mid mushrooms. I'm going to pick Gino.
[3567.48s -> 3584.78s]  All right. I can leave. No, I can't leave. I just know I can. I didn't ban anybody. I just sucked
[3584.78s -> 3600.07s]  up all their messages in a vacuum cleaner. They're still here. All right. Check this out.
[3600.07s -> 3626.22s]  Want something funny? I love freaking out my new guests with that one. Those of you guys that are
[3626.22s -> 3630.30s]  new to the stream, ah, you probably were like, what the fuck? Man, this stream is awesome.
[3631.42s -> 3650.28s]  I love freaking out new guests. Actually. Okay. Lucky. There it is. I'm going to do this one.
[3651.00s -> 3667.02s]  Is that what we are? We're guests. Could be. I wasn't prepared for it. Okay. That can kill
[3667.02s -> 3676.44s]  you. Is that the variety? And now he throws out the little, the action figure. 19 and eight,
[3676.44s -> 3689.11s]  double the coins. I can handle this one. I'll get this one, but I do need to heal.
[3693.96s -> 3712.82s]  Oh, I don't need to do it to Bowser. He'll be fine. Bowser can handle it. Okay. So let's go.
[3713.46s -> 3717.19s]  Everybody has their gear. I got there. All this stuff that they need.
[3723.96s -> 3730.42s]  Damn it. I tried to jump the whole thing. I need this though, because otherwise I'm going to get
[3730.42s -> 3736.98s]  slammed dunked on. This is going to be interesting. What happens here?
[3739.13s -> 3742.81s]  Yeah. Aren't you glad that Mario has no magic defense? Cause he's almost dead.
[3743.45s -> 3760.42s]  Are you guys glad you clicked on power? 12 times? 10 times? That was the plan.
[3761.62s -> 3793.32s]  How did I miss everybody? Oh, come on. Go to the back. If we didn't click health once,
[3793.32s -> 3813.32s]  you'd have the strength to do this. I'm good. I'm lucky. Do the spee voice. I don't remember how.
[3817.34s -> 3825.94s]  Experience. This is important. I have no idea. Help me. This is for like 30 EXP. That's pretty
[3825.94s -> 3875.35s]  good. One versus 100. All right. So, uh, how do I get this one? Like that. Memo left by Magellan.
[3875.35s -> 3881.35s]  There's an S in the word. I can skip this whole thing by the way. I already, I know.
[3882.23s -> 3899.37s]  I know though. I know the whole thing. That's not cheating. Okay. If you study for your math test
[3899.37s -> 3910.68s]  and you know the math problems, are you cheating on your math test? I'm sorry. I didn't know.
[3911.48s -> 3926.62s]  Second try. I am going to do this for the flower tabs though.
[3928.02s -> 3931.54s]  It is found on the bed of the ocean and it has an S. It is a Pearls.
[3932.66s -> 3938.38s]  Now let's just, you know, let's level up a little. It's going to be a tough fight.
[3938.38s -> 3960.28s]  Those are the most dangerous. Probably the Grim Reaper. Not messing around.
[3971.78s -> 3994.25s]  Fuck. And I wish I had a Lucky right here. That was, that's pretty good actually.
[3995.21s -> 3999.82s]  All right. I want the flower tabs. This is a three-dimensional maze.
[4000.90s -> 4026.58s]  Press X if you give up. I'm just feeling on the walls.
[4032.01s -> 4090.38s]  What? No, go back over here. Over that. Up on this. Come out this door. I can't, I don't know
[4090.38s -> 4135.43s]  how to do it. I can't move anywhere. I got nowhere to go. Am I even up a level? I'm stuck. I think
[4135.43s -> 4164.09s]  I'm actually stuck up here. I'm pressing up, down. I'm trying to move. Am I there? Where am I?
[4177.99s -> 4184.73s]  I can get like up here somewhere. Okay. I can't go up left. I can go left,
[4185.37s -> 4192.14s]  but that brings me all the way down here. Can I go right from here? Okay. Can I go up from here?
[4192.14s -> 4197.48s]  Can I go down from here? Can I go left from here? Can I go up from here? Can I go,
[4197.48s -> 4222.47s]  can I go down from here? Okay. Up. Left. Right. Jump. Okay. Right. Up. Jump. Right. Jump.
[4223.53s -> 4232.65s]  Down. Jump. Right. Jump. Down. Jump. Right. Jump. Down. Jump. Right. Jump. Up. Jump.
[4234.60s -> 4248.20s]  Left. Jump. Up. Jump. Down. Right. Up. There's like something blocking me here.
[4260.50s -> 4314.65s]  Okay. Oh, fuck. Up. Fuck am I? Come on, Mario. Get over here. Ooh. Ooh. All right.
[4314.65s -> 4325.78s]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for viewing. There's two vowels. This is royal syrup. I will
[4325.78s -> 4349.61s]  place a honey syrup. I'm out. Got it. Can't jump down. That's fine. Oh, there's the uh,
[4349.61s -> 4358.30s]  this is the guy that sells stuff. Hey, it's good to see you. If only I had known that. I forgot
[4358.30s -> 4365.83s]  that you were here. I want. I got pretty much everything I need. I'll give you a hint. The
[4365.83s -> 4373.26s]  password has something to do with the sea. Even if you don't get through all six of the obstacles,
[4373.26s -> 4387.45s]  you would try to deduce your way through. Good luck. Can I jump over you? I think I can. No,
[4387.45s -> 4403.19s]  I can't. Just fight him. Uh, let's do. This is actually kind of a big fight. Come on, Mario.
[4403.19s -> 4460.81s]  Got them all. Boom. Boom. Yes. That was a big hit. Lucky. You can't stay awake. I can help. This
[4460.81s -> 4477.74s]  is only for that person. So everybody else mute. I'm gonna give you three seconds. I just have a
[4477.74s -> 4501.80s]  chalkboard back here and I just scraped. Okay. Tell everybody they can unmute. Yeah, you can
[4501.80s -> 4521.05s]  unmute. All right. Pick. No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Not yet. Can you do that but
[4521.05s -> 4527.85s]  louder? No. It's as loud as you're ever gonna get. That was just enough of a weird sound to
[4527.85s -> 4559.58s]  have somebody go, what the fuck was that? All right. Now pick please. Super lame. Going for power
[4559.58s -> 4570.66s]  again. He's screaming. I'm just sitting here going like, I don't, I wouldn't want to miss that, to
[4570.66s -> 4583.67s]  be honest. I just blow up my vocal cords screaming as loud as I can. I can't do that. If I were to
[4583.67s -> 4588.38s]  do that, if I were to scream as loud as I fucking can, I would have to stop screaming. It would be
[4588.38s -> 4601.05s]  over. I would sound like this for the rest of the entire day and it would hurt. I don't know how
[4601.05s -> 4626.14s]  people scream because they're angry. I guess that's true. Wait a minute. Are you guys actually
[4626.14s -> 4647.22s]  clicking on HP? I'm very interested in this. Okay. Thank you. 89. Mallow didn't even have to do
[4647.22s -> 4689.72s]  anything in these level. Mallow learns shocker. Super. End of career. End of career voice.
[4690.44s -> 4705.30s]  Playing Sekiro. What? Hold on. I need to hear this. This is important. I need to know what the fuck
[4705.30s -> 4727.29s]  this is. End of career? What did I do? I just want to hear it. Um, I don't know. I can't think of
[4727.29s -> 4739.64s]  anybody. Mark Simpson. Homer. No, that's going to fix it. Homer. Holy shit. It's Joan Rivers.
[4740.36s -> 4745.40s]  Oh, Joan Rivers. Absolutely. It's unbelievable. Oh darling, you look so beautiful right now on
[4745.40s -> 4750.76s]  the runway. Let me tell you something about just how I forgot about the fuck. I forgot. Fuck it.
[4750.76s -> 4755.88s]  Let's go. I can't fix it. I think I have this voice forever. I have this voice forever. I fucked
[4755.88s -> 4761.27s]  it up. I coughed too much and now it's over. I actually have this voice forever. This is it.
[4761.27s -> 4774.68s]  My career is over. Oh my God. My career is over. I have to turn it to Larry the cable guy. Oh no.
[4775.56s -> 4784.73s]  Hold on. I'll be back. I actually remember this because I remember I started doing like Bernie
[4784.73s -> 4790.82s]  Sanders and Larry David and shit. That was crazy though. Damn. Good thing I recovered.
[4794.82s -> 4808.30s]  What did you guys pick? You picked this one. Crazy. Haha. Damn. It's a good thing that you...
[4808.30s -> 4820.26s]  No, I don't smoke. I don't smoke. Quit spreading rumors about me. 49. Does he have the highest?
[4821.50s -> 4843.08s]  He might. Fuck. Oh, it's a bunch of coins. Damn it. Okay. Crystal. And how do you have
[4843.08s -> 4867.59s]  that clip just ready to go? Daryl slaps himself. That is the worst clip ever. That's seriously the
[4867.59s -> 4891.18s]  worst clip that's ever been recorded on this stream. It has to be. It has to be. How do you
[4891.18s -> 4914.44s]  slap yourself? I... very carefully. Bone gutted. What the fuck? All right. Peach is level 11.
[4915.24s -> 4923.34s]  She will have the highest magic attack of the whole group, I believe. And she learns sleepy time.
[4926.36s -> 4938.15s]  Give me something to work with here. We're gonna have to make a pretty
[4939.11s -> 4946.23s]  major decision soon as to what we want to make our final party look like.
[4947.03s -> 4954.62s]  Is it gonna be Peach, Mario, and Bowser? Is it gonna be Peach, Mario, and Mallow? Is it gonna be
[4954.62s -> 4968.06s]  Geno, Mario, and Mallow? Is it gonna be Geno, Toadstool, and Bowser? Come on. I can see something
[4968.06s -> 4973.66s]  with the extension not installed and you're not clicking. This is... we're at 43, 42. Come on.
[4974.46s -> 4994.36s]  Thank you. I'm so sorry. All right. It's gonna be HP. Thank you for voting. Three, two, one.
[4994.36s -> 5001.67s]  But that actually helps a lot. All right. Now do I have enough money to pay for something?
[5002.23s -> 5009.77s]  Let's see. Let me see. We got six. Pick me up seven maple syrups. That's a lot of maple
[5009.77s -> 5034.28s]  syrups I probably don't need. Okay. Just chop up. I want the stuff that's in here. There's a screw
[5034.28s -> 5039.56s]  that's getting really loose on my chair. And I could probably really easily screw it in.
[5040.84s -> 5046.52s]  And I think it's one of those scenarios where it's a very major, like, construction part of
[5046.52s -> 5057.06s]  this chair. And if it goes, the whole chair might just break underneath me. I'll be fine.
[5057.06s -> 5083.82s]  Floating coins? It's a load-bearing screw. I can farm coins here though, can't I?
[5086.49s -> 5133.03s]  No. Ah. No. What the fuck? No. What? I'm actually mad about this. How am I not touching this one?
[5133.03s -> 5177.45s]  What the hell are you doing? I thought I was gonna turn to something else.
[5177.45s -> 5204.33s]  You guys realize I never did these because I knew it was pearls. Why is that so hard? No,
[5204.33s -> 5208.89s]  but I thought I had to keep up with it. I never did that one. Half of these I didn't do because
[5208.89s -> 5211.93s]  I knew it was pearls. So I didn't do them. I've never walked in these fucking rooms.
[5218.15s -> 5235.11s]  That's the first time I've ever been in that room. I knew someone was gonna say it. I was
[5235.11s -> 5240.87s]  waiting for someone to say sans. Every time this character pops up, I look over the chat and I
[5240.87s -> 5248.07s]  don't see it. And I'm like, really? No one has said it yet. I knew it was gonna happen. I was
[5248.07s -> 5262.30s]  waiting. Okay, those are the really big fans of Undertale and Sans. If Sans was in Smash Brothers,
[5263.02s -> 5283.53s]  Sans from Undertale was in Smash Brothers, but he was $150. Would you buy it? I'd be tempted.
[5287.42s -> 5301.08s]  He's not in a pass. He's $149. Finally crossed 100 HP with some character. That's good.
[5316.74s -> 5338.97s]  Nothing is too much for Sans. Would you pay that much for Gino in Smash? No, I would not. Now
[5338.97s -> 5346.73s]  there is my public persona where I say no and there's my private in the dark in my bedroom
[5347.45s -> 5352.89s]  when nobody can see what I'm doing. And I've got my credit card and I'm punching in the numbers
[5353.77s -> 5367.05s]  and make sure nobody's around. And then I have Gino. You know, is that? And then who's gonna even
[5367.05s -> 5383.05s]  know? I'll just always disconnect my switch from online. You guys pick the up. All right. Boom. I
[5383.05s -> 5401.72s]  think I have to jump on them. I'm telling you, I've never been in these rooms. I've never been
[5401.72s -> 5430.89s]  inside of these rooms in 20 years. I think I have to move it? Yep. Ah, mushroom and it's worthless.
[5430.89s -> 5441.13s]  At last, two consonants are side by side. At least two consonants are side by side. Oh,
[5442.01s -> 5460.87s]  that's a stumper. Save it. And what? What? Oh, do I do this puzzle?
[5462.87s -> 5469.85s]  Maybe I can do it from high up. Oh, it's not working.
[5480.42s -> 5519.43s]  Mario's password is motes. The R comes before the one. Just like Portal. Yeah. All right. It's
[5519.43s -> 5526.15s]  Pearls. Those of you guys that is your first time watching. Letter number one is P.
[5527.90s -> 5543.16s]  Letter number two is E. A. R. L. S. The password is pearls.
[5546.22s -> 5552.38s]  Good job. I'll let you through. If you can get past me, then we believe first, that is.
[5553.26s -> 5589.18s]  Secret octopus battle. Whack. Oh, that hurts. Damn. Bob, so you do a ton of damage.
[5589.90s -> 5613.38s]  Am I playing? I'm playing on an SNES. I'm playing on an SNES classic. The little mini thing.
[5623.74s -> 5644.46s]  And if memory serves me correct, after this, there is. This is the part of the controversy that
[5645.42s -> 5651.74s]  Nintendo had to face was that character's gone. And a lot of the reviewers were really upset
[5651.74s -> 5654.30s]  about it. They're like, wait, what happened to my character? They never explained it.
[5654.30s -> 5660.97s]  Bowser's just gone. He's just dead. I don't know if people got upset about it and didn't
[5660.97s -> 5668.57s]  make me stop playing here. Same joke for you. I mean, come on. I have to make every time I
[5668.57s -> 5676.87s]  have to make that joke. I have to. It's not old material if it was less than 24 hours ago.
[5678.98s -> 5700.12s]  This is not my, like, comedy special from 2006. This was 12 hours ago. All right, I gotta heal.
[5700.12s -> 5715.80s]  Let's heal Gino. All right, I like to go right for the legs. So we're gonna go left leg and then
[5715.80s -> 5719.08s]  right leg and then face because these things are annoying. They do like 10 damage every hit.
[5720.26s -> 5736.82s]  I'm not a fan of it, so I want to get rid of them. Let's, in fact, let's do super flame. 96.
[5737.62s -> 5747.46s]  How we doing? Venom drool. Didn't really do much now, did it? Okay, let's get another...
[5747.46s -> 5764.68s]  No, no, no, no. I need to save these. Let's do a Gino beam. Remember when you did that stand-up
[5764.68s -> 5774.55s]  set for Comedy Central in 2005? That was great. Yeah, and remember I made that joke about how...
[5774.55s -> 5780.47s]  fuck. Remember I made that funny joke about how Super Mario RPG when Bowser gets thrown up in
[5780.47s -> 5784.71s]  the air? How much controversy. Imagine going on stage and saying that, like, telling that.
[5784.71s -> 5794.18s]  No one ever had any idea what you're talking about. Do I use to pick me up here or do I just
[5794.18s -> 5823.50s]  do this without Mario? Throwing undead Mario, yeah. 132. Pretty good. Shit, I didn't get that.
[5830.34s -> 5857.00s]  You know what? Just boost Bowser. Drain beam on all of them. Mario, your defense is so bad
[5857.08s -> 5889.42s]  against magic. Can I replace Mario? No, no, no. That's it. I'm free. Mario might be dead here
[5889.42s -> 5897.58s]  again. I'm doing it without Mario. He's not... he's just... he's starting into, like, some...
[5897.58s -> 5906.70s]  he's a liability at this point. Got it. I'm so glad I did not use that pick-me-up because I'm
[5906.70s -> 5923.35s]  gonna need it. 100 coins, 34 experience. That's pretty good. All right, let's heal up. Everybody
[5923.35s -> 5942.90s]  is all right. Oh, everybody is. Hello? Right, go in here. Should I attack one of these? How close
[5942.90s -> 5954.07s]  is everybody leveling up? 70, 170. All right, we're gonna... we're pretty much there. Another
[5954.07s -> 5969.06s]  two or three battles should do it. Never mind. I'm gonna climb up here. Why did I show those stats?
[5969.06s -> 5985.16s]  They're terrible. They're not terrible. They're fine. They're just fine. I don't like this.
[6000.63s -> 6005.51s]  I didn't know that... that you just did so many fake outs. I don't even know which one of those is
[6005.51s -> 6043.90s]  real. Holy shit, that's a lot of damage. Once again. Damn it. Mario. Mario. Mario, your defense is so
[6043.90s -> 6070.60s]  bad. I should just do a two-person team at this point. 20 experience. All right, on this next
[6070.60s -> 6078.06s]  level up, we really got to figure this out. Mario is starting to become extreme weight. In fact,
[6078.06s -> 6100.89s]  I'm gonna do this now because Mario's just not good at all. How about more power? I gotta get
[6100.89s -> 6112.42s]  him a better item. The masher is good, but almost there. Another, like, two fights or so should do
[6112.42s -> 6139.67s]  it. Oh, come on. Really? What are you doing back here? Once again. 57 damage. Why do I feel like
[6139.67s -> 6146.84s]  there's something wrong with his character? Look at how much Bowser's gonna do right here. To the
[6146.84s -> 6176.14s]  mouse. 150? What's wrong with Mario? Is he all right? Ow, my face. All right, here comes the
[6176.14s -> 6202.90s]  opportunity. It's a lot of coins. What the fuck? Which one's me? I don't know which one I am.
[6219.40s -> 6234.42s]  Easy as fight of the night right here. Is the Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man?
[6238.09s -> 6245.05s]  Fuck, I fell off. There's something in here. I think there is something in here, actually.
[6245.05s -> 6283.82s]  All right, which one am I? Karo-Karo-Kola. All right, I'm jumping out of the fucking map of
[6283.82s -> 6309.51s]  the game. I'm going to, like, the developer. That's all, folks. Karo-Karo-Kola is amazing,
[6309.51s -> 6338.54s]  though. Not Mario. Whatever. All right, don't. This is bad, potentially. Not quite. I'm not
[6338.54s -> 6350.79s]  gonna use it. I can do it. We can do this together. The only threat is this thing back here.
[6351.35s -> 6365.42s]  I'm gonna heal up with Mallow, and I'll be good to go. Actually, I'll heal from the level up.
[6365.42s -> 6387.03s]  That's about to happen. There we go. Mario has reached level 11. Magic defense increases to 23.
[6387.75s -> 6452.84s]  That's better. Gino Whirl. There it is. Gino Whirl can do 999 damage, if you do it right.
[6468.31s -> 6491.16s]  This is closer, but... Hold on. Hold on. All right. That's it. That's it.
[6492.17s -> 6511.34s]  Thank you. That's it. 52 magic attack. And there's Mallow. Magic is so strong sometimes,
[6511.34s -> 6524.73s]  but he's so weak. His defense is 30. And when your HP is that low and your defense is that low,
[6524.73s -> 6544.84s]  you just get hit by one thing and you immediately need to eat a whole mushroom. Not good. Right
[6544.84s -> 6571.35s]  flower gang. Right flower. Wait, I gotta get over there. All right, everyone's been healed.
[6572.07s -> 6583.99s]  Except for Bowser, right? No. Bowser's still... Ah! Oh, okay. I actually have to take one of these,
[6583.99s -> 6609.00s]  so otherwise I'm gonna be in deep shit. But I have to do the magic. Oops. Bowser, come on.
[6619.42s -> 6635.14s]  Mario did something. A little bit. Ah! That's so annoying. Because now I have to... Let's just do...
[6635.14s -> 6651.46s]  No, Gino Whirl is 8. Gino Beam on dry bones. New weapon. New weapon. Need a new weapon for
[6651.46s -> 6702.28s]  Mario. Bad. I need to accessorize as well. Give Mario the amulet. Yeah. He's gonna have such a
[6702.28s -> 6718.22s]  terrible power though. Then what about, what about, what about Gino? Come on! I'm trying to get rid
[6718.22s -> 6738.36s]  of the two in the back there and now I have to Gino Beam this dry bones. Irritating. I have to
[6738.36s -> 6746.06s]  do something here. Like, we have to get rid of... Bump somebody. This is gonna kill it, right? Yeah.
[6746.06s -> 6758.66s]  I mean, come on. Shit. That's not good. Uh, Mario's dead. And Bowser. This is cutting it close. This
[6758.66s -> 6764.98s]  is cutting way too close. This is a really, really stupid idea. In fact, it's so dumb, in fact,
[6764.98s -> 6781.61s]  that I, I have, I have to heal. I'm gonna heal Bowser. See? This is the no healer team. Yeah,
[6781.61s -> 6808.84s]  this is straight offense. This is offense to the max. Nice throw. Pure water. I could sell that
[6808.84s -> 6814.04s]  for a lot. All right. Now there's something back here. Something back here. Nope. Nothing back
[6814.04s -> 6843.02s]  here. Nothing back there. All right. I just had to check. Full health. Let's see. Oh, it's, this is
[6843.02s -> 6861.34s]  where it is. Okay. You got it. I got him. All right. This is another mimic. Ow. Gino Waro. Let's go,
[6861.34s -> 6870.92s]  baby. Damn it. I didn't get it. It's right after it hits, right? It's like right after it goes off
[6870.92s -> 6885.13s]  screen or is it right when he winks to the camera? Holy shit. That was a lot of damage.
[6896.01s -> 6929.51s]  That was so much. Let's get it. Ah. Oh my God. I just, I destroyed this thing. I love the little
[6929.51s -> 6953.24s]  itchy goombas. They like the little, like itchies. Ow. 22 fucking damage, Mario. Are you for real?
[6953.24s -> 6959.06s]  Are we sure that Mario has armor on? I didn't take Mario's armor off, right?
[6959.06s -> 6987.00s]  100 coins, 17 experience and got a safety badge. Very cool. Let's actually, let's do some
[6987.00s -> 6996.71s]  reorganizing here. Safety badge. Prevents mute and poison attacks. The amulet on Mario
[6999.27s -> 7011.22s]  is not as good as the amulet on, actually the amulet on Gino is also bad. 125 wakeup pin.
[7011.86s -> 7016.34s]  No. Jump shoes. Jump shoes are better than the amulet? How the fuck is that possible?
[7020.74s -> 7028.60s]  No. I am really, really stupid. I read it backwards for no reason. All right. Safety badge
[7028.60s -> 7038.97s]  is better than the, yeah. That prevents mute and poison. What does this next? I think that's
[7038.97s -> 7049.46s]  better because now Mario's got 74, 45, 62, 45. So Gino now is going to be pretty, pretty shitty.
[7050.26s -> 7063.10s]  It's all right though. I think we're good. Let's take mushroom. Max mushroom. I need some
[7063.10s -> 7078.38s]  mushrooms. I have all these like caro caro colas. Too much maple syrup. Pick me up, pick me up.
[7079.02s -> 7092.06s]  Mushroom, mid mushroom, mid mushroom, max mushroom, max mushroom. Jupiter storm coming in.
[7094.94s -> 7111.27s]  Whatever. No, no, no, no, no. All right, here we go. It's what? Why is this back? Oh.
[7115.26s -> 7123.86s]  Go to the door. Was there, was there a door here? Is it a door? Holy shit. It's a frog coin.
[7124.50s -> 7137.26s]  We're going to jump immediately. Nope. Jump one, two. Oh, you idiot. Wait, I can,
[7144.38s -> 7163.50s]  I gotta run. I don't want to fight this. No, I'll just fight it. No, I want to run. Good. All right.
[7163.50s -> 7180.98s]  Frog coin down there. I wonder if I can go in a little whirlpool or something.
[7181.62s -> 7189.38s]  There's a lot of frog coins down here. Three. Keep your eye on those. I'm going to check this
[7189.46s -> 7211.82s]  out later. Oh, it's Christmas morning. Wow. Nice. When's the carnival stream? September 21st.
[7214.47s -> 7255.86s]  Anything else up here? No, the door, right? No. Yeah. Now we're underwater. See you in 19 days.
[7255.86s -> 7285.93s]  That's true. I will be here in 19 days. I'm running away. Ow. Coward. I'm telling my mom on you.
[7299.80s -> 7306.50s]  Indecisive today. I feel like all of Toadstools have been completely split.
[7308.50s -> 7338.62s]  At least 20 to 30 percent on each one. I wonder why that is. 75. Aye yai yai. I think they have
[7338.62s -> 7371.10s]  a hundred health. Mr. Kipper. 36. What is that bullshit? You want to bring, you want to bring,
[7371.10s -> 7396.02s]  you want to bring Peach out? Who do I replace? 75, 97. So I do the original, the original Nintendo
[7396.02s -> 7406.12s]  Dream Team. Bowser's too good. Bowser's the best of the three so far. I'll do it for a little bit.
[7407.00s -> 7415.06s]  Uh, hold on. Does she have any weapons? She has slap glove, polka dress, and she's about to have
[7415.06s -> 7429.22s]  a wake-up pin. Now get the thing off of, uh, Gino. What does Gino have for a safety badge, right?
[7434.26s -> 7444.39s]  Get Mario out of here? I would. I can't. 62 wake-up pin jumpshoes. All right, let's, let's,
[7444.39s -> 7467.32s]  let's see what, let's see what she can do. Point to point. All the stuff is outdated.
[7468.74s -> 7480.23s]  Oh shit, that's right. Uh oh. What's going on here? Who are you? What are you looking for? A star?
[7480.95s -> 7489.18s]  I'll let you see stars. Anyway, you're out of luck. You see, whenever falls into the sea becomes
[7489.18s -> 7497.66s]  Johnny's property. Got that, matey? Oh, and one last thing. Read my lips. We ain't letting you
[7497.66s -> 7533.77s]  through. Read my lips. No new taxes. Therapy. Group hug. Sleepy time. It didn't do anything.
[7534.73s -> 7557.29s]  Oh, oh my chest. Oh, 210. You guys want me to replace Bowser?
[7560.82s -> 7578.82s]  That's a great, that's a great attack. Whack, whack, whack. Terma sucks. Terma sucks. What the
[7578.82s -> 7589.70s]  hell is this? Bowser at level 12. Breached 100 attack. Magic attack and magic defense is so bad,
[7589.70s -> 7598.15s]  though. Terrible. Just awful. I have to put Gino back in because she doesn't have any of her armor
[7598.15s -> 7614.46s]  or any new weapon or anything, so we're gonna do it after this. She's a healer. Okay, all right.
[7614.46s -> 7640.01s]  No, I'll stick with it. Power. More power. More power. 105. Are you stronger than you look?
[7641.29s -> 7656.50s]  Better warm me up her dick. Come on, mates. All right, where's the intruder? I don't see him.
[7657.88s -> 7672.36s]  Did he get away? There he is. Get him, boys. Here, this is on us. Oh, what the, how dare you dodge
[7672.36s -> 7686.62s]  the barrel? Are you guys all right? Are you guys okay? Hey, how'd you get up here so fast? Well,
[7686.62s -> 7695.06s]  your luck has run out. We don't take kindly to strangers here. That's a lot. Okay, this is a lot.
[7695.62s -> 7725.34s]  Poison gas time. Oh, that's pretty good. Are they poison? Oh, they are poison. Eight damage a tick.
[7726.30s -> 7744.42s]  That's not good. Let's do it again. I wonder if I'll do it. There, nice. I think I can kill them
[7744.42s -> 7767.66s]  all with just regular attacks now. Dealing 70 damage is pretty good regardless of no magic.
[7767.66s -> 7779.38s]  Yeah, that is really good. You're pretty tough, mate. All right, I'll let you through to the
[7779.38s -> 7796.70s]  Johnny's place. You're pretty tough. You're pretty tough. Yeah, so you're the Mario. Yeah,
[7798.22s -> 7804.41s]  not much to look at. Well, this store fell into my sea, so it's mine. If you want it,
[7804.41s -> 7823.54s]  you'll have to fight for it. Here's a boss fight. I probably could have done that a little,
[7824.50s -> 7841.74s]  a little more of the promotion in there. Got them all except the one over here. All right,
[7841.74s -> 7859.35s]  I'm thinking a super jump on Johnny. 58, 70. Whoa, that's really, really fucking good.
[7860.07s -> 7863.99s]  That's, all right Bowser, you've solidified yourself as the best character.
[7864.71s -> 7885.46s]  Now, the strategy here is you want to get rid of the minions, but you want to leave a minion,
[7885.46s -> 7890.26s]  because if you don't, oh, and guys, I just got a lucky. You know what that means? I'm going to be
[7890.26s -> 7902.25s]  relying on you to double whatever happens here. This is going to be a huge deal. I do not want to
[7902.25s -> 7924.07s]  kill Lucky again. Double. I'm going to heal myself. It's a pretty good heal. That's so good.
[7924.63s -> 7942.58s]  It's almost worth doing the poison gas and killing this thing again. 102. Yeah, tough. I wonder,
[7942.58s -> 7959.34s]  can I put him to sleep? I wonder if I can mess him up. Yeah, it takes less damage now.
[7969.80s -> 7979.42s]  Hmm, we're good. Putting a status, you're doing a status effect on a boss in an RPG.
[7980.54s -> 8004.81s]  Well, he said, I know, right. It's a bad idea. They're all immune. That was terrible. Don't
[8004.81s -> 8023.35s]  kill him. It's a shiny. Well, that's just too bad. If it truly was a shiny, he'd have sprinkles
[8023.35s -> 8052.89s]  flying around him. Let's try 26. Come on. Stop it. Who does he heal? Try to top off somebody.
[8053.77s -> 8066.17s]  Let's just group hug. Good. Well, Peach is actually pretty damn good. See you later. See
[8066.17s -> 8082.30s]  you later, Tony. All right, guys, double your coins. We'll lose them all. I probably should
[8082.30s -> 8092.02s]  have given you just a second. I didn't even give you guys a second. People might not have even
[8092.02s -> 8098.97s]  looking at the monitor. Oops, I'm sorry. Oh, no, this is bad. I don't know which one. It could be
[8098.97s -> 8105.66s]  any one of these then. I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry. I just, I don't know.
[8108.90s -> 8117.54s]  Is it the middle one? Holy shit, you guys did it. I can't fucking believe it. Nice. And Malos
[8117.54s -> 8135.93s]  leveled up. Well, thank you, Benedict Cumberbatch, for being right. They said I was right. Good.
[8136.01s -> 8156.30s]  Thank you. Thanks for the help. Okay, more magic. I should just honestly replace. I mean,
[8157.34s -> 8166.20s]  no, I can't do that. Okay, I'm, I'm impressed. Mighty. You've earned the star.
[8167.35s -> 8183.13s]  Think of it as a souvenir of our fight. Funnily enough, Johnny's voice was voted the worst voice
[8183.13s -> 8191.42s]  of the whole playthrough by a majority of Jerma985 subscribers. When interviewed about it, Jerma
[8192.14s -> 8201.43s]  very clearly said, I just wanted to do Mad Eye Moody again. And it was an excuse to do it.
[8201.43s -> 8218.47s]  End quote. He must have really wanted that star. Now go on and get out of here before I change my
[8218.47s -> 8229.72s]  mind. Johnny's our main man. He even fights in his sleep. We'd follow him anywhere. Hop on the
[8229.72s -> 8239.82s]  trampoline in the next room. It'll take you outside. Go on now. Give it a try. Okay. Thanks, guys.
[8240.38s -> 8262.78s]  Hmm. 50 bucks. Oh, shit. Mr. Purple, thanks for the $50. 5000 bits, they say. When are you pursuing
[8262.78s -> 8274.23s]  a career in voice acting? Never. Right now, actually. You found the star. Well done.
[8275.11s -> 8283.75s]  My dear Johnny, end here. You are so gullible. Don't you know who I am? I'm Yardage,
[8283.75s -> 8291.03s]  a member of Smithy's gang. Chalked. It's no wonder my impersonation of an ordinary person was
[8291.03s -> 8298.50s]  flawless. Your search for the stars has worried Smithy. So if I take the star back to him,
[8298.50s -> 8305.94s]  I'll earn a brownie points. This is the way to get ahead. It's futile to try and fight me,
[8305.94s -> 8325.99s]  just hand it off nice and easy. And to think I got the star without even soiling my pants.
[8326.79s -> 8333.90s]  I'm such a genius, it scares me sometimes. No wonder I'm so important. All right, everyone,
[8333.90s -> 8342.07s]  listen up. We're returning to the castle. All right, should be here about now. Wait, come back.
[8342.79s -> 8384.94s]  I didn't mean to give it to you. I can't get a free night. It's locked. Hey, someone's in there.
[8396.25s -> 8404.34s]  Blade's late. What's taking him so long? We need to get out of here. I gotta get out of here.
[8404.34s -> 8411.93s]  This is just great. Mario got up with us. Only one thing we can do now, and although we may
[8411.93s -> 8421.93s]  be a little rusty, we'll have to swim for it. Not so fast there. That star is a gift to me,
[8421.93s -> 8427.83s]  mate. Mario, you spineless dogs have no code of honor. We'll make you a walk the plank.
[8430.18s -> 8434.58s]  Joy! Maybe we should have leave the Mario the pleasure of wrapping things up here.
[8439.67s -> 8470.60s]  Eh. I guess we'll take our disguises off now. Group formation! No rest. Three bosses in a row.
[8470.60s -> 8480.74s]  No rest. Oh, fuck. This actually is bad. This is actually a hard fight, and he does a lot of damage,
[8480.74s -> 8485.38s]  as you'll see in a second. Oh, yeah, this is bad. I'm gonna lose. When was the last time I saved
[8485.38s -> 8504.97s]  the game? Okay. Oh, good. Good. Yeah, you're right. Right. Oh, boy, this is bad. Okay. Bowser,
[8504.97s -> 8537.80s]  it's off, too. Oof. What, super jump, maybe? No. Mario, you are not very good. Are you good,
[8537.80s -> 8560.26s]  Jerma? You're forgetting things that happened seconds ago. You're telling me that, that...
[8560.26s -> 8566.34s]  Okay, he must have a high magic damage blocker. Can't eat a group hug right now, or everyone
[8566.34s -> 8577.50s]  dies. Good. Uh, if Peach was not part of this party, I would lose. So, good party swap before
[8577.50s -> 8591.19s]  this encounter. Which one's the real Yardavich? That's not the real Yardavich. This is the real
[8591.19s -> 8617.42s]  Yardavich. Yep. I have plenty of FP. Good thing I blocked that. Nice block, Peach. Come back
[8617.42s -> 8627.21s]  together again. Uh, I need to keep Peach alive, so we're just gonna keep the heal up. Yeah.
[8638.52s -> 8662.25s]  I'm all right. I'm gonna just heal Mario. Thank you. All right, they're back together again.
[8676.89s -> 8690.66s]  Three. I need another group hug. This would have been hell without Peach. I would have used every
[8690.66s -> 8701.05s]  poke. Somebody would have just had been on total item duty, and that actually, that also may have
[8701.05s -> 8714.89s]  killed Peach as well. Oh, not good. Um, I actually, I'm gonna just, I was gonna use a mushroom on
[8714.89s -> 8726.79s]  Peach, but no. Should be all right. No, she won't. All right, she would have been fine.
[8727.35s -> 8746.63s]  Ow. God damn it. Stop targeting Peach. Well, I guess you're doing the right thing. Just defend
[8746.63s -> 8755.02s]  with Peach. Yeah, that's not a, no, no, I don't even have to. Counter's over. I win. That could
[8755.02s -> 8768.76s]  have been way worse. Mario has reached level 12. Almost 100 health on Mario. Uh, let's get,
[8769.96s -> 8805.78s]  my click maps is currently disconnected. What? Uh, that's weird. All right, go for it. 31 to 30.
[8805.78s -> 8813.18s]  Oh, it's a fight. It's a chat fight. Who's gonna prevail? The thing that we click on every single
[8813.18s -> 8821.96s]  time or something new. By the way, that is 30. That is over 30%. That's 34%, guys, because Mario,
[8821.96s -> 8842.10s]  they're overlapping. Pride flowers at 20%. Uh oh. Oh no, it's, oh, it's bullshit because there's 10,000
[8842.10s -> 8847.27s]  clicks. Sorry, guys. I didn't have the thing where you can't click a thousand times.
[8848.15s -> 8884.31s]  Choose wisely. Oh my God. How about just pick one? Wow. It's time to close it in 10,
[8885.03s -> 8912.63s]  nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. Fuck. Nice work, everybody.
[8916.23s -> 8937.16s]  Try again. This is flower. Oh, right. Flower. Oh, you know, actually kind of, I like, I like the
[8937.16s -> 8943.82s]  whole like right flower. Everyone click right flower because that, that's just a place for
[8943.82s -> 8949.58s]  people who's vote. They, you know, we got like a nice clean, like 60% of our audience here voting
[8949.58s -> 8954.90s]  here. We've distracted the, the people that are just messing around. So this is a really good
[8954.90s -> 8978.47s]  thing to do, I think. It doesn't really matter, could still magic. 57, 35. Got it. Smithy is now
[8978.47s -> 8984.04s]  in the hurries for the star pieces. What horrible surprises might he have in store for Mario?
[8984.68s -> 8989.35s]  It's the last chance I'm going to be able to have. I'm not going to be able to do that anymore. So
[8992.39s -> 8999.53s]  nope. To Mario. To Mario. No one knew it must have been a breeze knocking out Yardovich.
[9000.09s -> 9003.88s]  Ah, by the way, my pirates say they saw a huge axe flying across the sky.
[9004.44s -> 9010.18s]  Hey, it's probably one of the Smithy's nasty friends. Go get him, pal. Well, my girls have
[9010.18s -> 9018.79s]  hailed on me. So I'll be heading back down now. Drop him. I couldn't read the rest. It was shitty
[9018.79s -> 9038.94s]  handwriting. Here we go. Let's get in here. Hey, everybody. I've come to rescue you. Thank you so
[9038.94s -> 9044.62s]  much. I've had enough cramped dirty old places like this. Hey, fellow, you got outside of a blind
[9044.70s -> 9051.58s]  piece. It was mighty unpleasant in here. Thanks for helping us. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. Be sure
[9051.58s -> 9058.26s]  to stop by our shop. Well, thank you for freeing us. I've got to get back to work now but stop by
[9058.26s -> 9069.74s]  at the end. See you there. Hey, Mario. Thank you for saving our little town of Seaside.
[9070.71s -> 9077.51s]  You exposed the fake townspeople and gave up your star to save us. Please take this with our thanks.
[9077.59s -> 9092.41s]  Got a flower box. This townspeople all sound like fucking goofy. Five distinct voices.
[9092.41s -> 9110.54s]  Count them. Weapon and armor. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes. I got 999
[9110.54s -> 9122.33s]  Geno World coins. Yes. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This is important. This is an overwhelming
[9122.33s -> 9128.38s]  amount of cool items, equipable items. Let's go with... This is a Mario weapon. This is the
[9128.38s -> 9135.48s]  Trooper Shell. I think this is better. This is the Parasol. This is for Toadstool. We want that.
[9136.28s -> 9149.08s]  Double Punch for Geno. Yep. Ribbit stick for Mallow. Okay. Please come in and browse. I'm running an
[9149.08s -> 9157.11s]  armor shop. Here we go. Sailor shirt. Sailor pants. Sailor cape. Nautica dress. Get... No.
[9157.99s -> 9167.53s]  We're about to go... No. We're gonna go to a new town. Nope. All right, I'll get one. Trooper Shell.
[9167.53s -> 9175.51s]  Masher is currently at 132. Oh, but I'm sick of looking at this shit. It's different.
[9175.51s -> 9178.63s]  It's the same damn thing. It's different though. It's... I don't want to see that same animation.
[9178.63s -> 9190.87s]  Get that thing out of here. Parasol. 96. That's much better. Double Punch is for Geno. Better than
[9190.87s -> 9200.36s]  the handgun. Double Punch. 125. Without an accessory. Holy shit, Geno. Ribbit stick. 100.
[9200.36s -> 9215.46s]  Better than symbols. Of course it is. Polka dress. Nautica dress. Much better. All right. So now we've
[9215.46s -> 9226.25s]  got... That's all right. I'm gonna stick with Peach for a little while. Let's sell this stuff.
[9228.15s -> 9243.37s]  Symbols. Masher. Handgun. Slap glove. Polka dress. Good. I got a lot of money. All right. Now,
[9243.37s -> 9252.39s]  let's go up here. Mario, if it's a star that you're looking for, I may be able to help you.
[9253.03s -> 9259.43s]  At the far side of Land's End is a town made up of reformed monsters. A mouse came by the other day,
[9259.43s -> 9264.47s]  and I overheard him boasting about a star of theirs. I don't know exactly where this town
[9264.47s -> 9275.59s]  is located, but if you follow the road, you'll get there. Good to see you again. Do you have a
[9275.59s -> 9282.71s]  chance to accumulate many frown coins? Yeah, I got plenty. No, that's what I wanted. Dumb. I need
[9282.71s -> 9305.43s]  one more. Hi, Mario. We've got a lot of health foods at our store. You gotta treat your body right.
[9310.26s -> 9317.18s]  This is a terrible store. Where are the mid mushrooms? I thought I could have a mid mushroom.
[9323.37s -> 9328.33s]  Hey, hey, hey. I'm the mushroom boy. Did you know that hidden amongst the regular mushrooms
[9328.33s -> 9334.33s]  are some special ones? Unreal, huh? I'll give you items in return for those special mushrooms,
[9334.33s -> 9340.63s]  but you've got to taste them to find out what kind they are. So I'll take a nibble first. I'm
[9340.63s -> 9344.55s]  hoping for a special mushroom, but even if it isn't, at least I'll get a meal out of it.
[9345.19s -> 9351.96s]  You have any mushrooms? Far out. Munch, munch, munch. That was just a regular mushroom. Thanks
[9351.96s -> 9366.65s]  for the snack. Is this the way for this guy to just get free food? I don't remember you.
[9369.82s -> 9378.12s]  Accessories. Oh, hello there. You were so brave to rescue us, and I'm so thankful. But listen,
[9378.12s -> 9380.60s]  maybe it's time you thought a little more about what you wear.
[9381.70s -> 9385.78s]  Accessorizing is a big business these days. Say anything you like here.
[9388.68s -> 9403.43s]  Antidote is pretty good. I already have fearless. True form Zoom shoes. You don't really...
[9407.72s -> 9412.60s]  Pitch shifted goofy is actually a pretty good voice. What do you mean pitch shifted goofy?
[9413.16s -> 9446.79s]  Pitched up or pitched down? It's pitched down? No, it's not. Five stars. All right, on our way.
[9447.59s -> 9460.36s]  Let's continue. I've got my items to land's end. Can you do the Trump voice for a character,
[9460.36s -> 9482.14s]  please? Yeah, sure. The next character that shows up will be Trump. Jumped it.
[9499.22s -> 9535.29s]  I want to get up there. Oh, how do I get this? Oh, look out. I sound like an alternate universe
[9535.29s -> 9545.70s]  Ray Romano. I 100% do not sound like Ray Romano. I don't... I don't know where you're getting that
[9545.70s -> 9555.64s]  from. What? We're talking... We're thinking of the same person, right? We're thinking of...
[9555.64s -> 9562.01s]  We're thinking of Ray Romano, right? Well, you know, it's me, Ray Romano. That's who you think...
[9562.01s -> 9587.06s]  You think I sound like that? Right now? You think I sound like Ray Romano? This guy's a no joke.
[9594.98s -> 9598.66s]  Pitch is dead. All right, I need to stop paying attention to the fact that like somebody thinks
[9598.66s -> 9604.10s]  I sound like Ray Romano because everyone's going to die here. Like Mario's about to die.
[9604.10s -> 9610.07s]  Bowser's about to be dead. They're both asleep. This is the first death incoming. Not quite.
[9610.79s -> 9640.46s]  You idiot. I want to go down because I want to check out this over here. There's some things I
[9640.46s -> 9650.25s]  think that are possible. Oh, I need this. I thought that was something. I'm just wrong all the time.
[9651.21s -> 9688.54s]  Ow. I do like the parasol. You just open it on him. I guess there's no... There's no way to get at it.
[9689.18s -> 9709.32s]  This is bad. Again, very bad. I need Peach to do group hug or I lose. Don't kill Peach.
[9711.75s -> 9738.71s]  Miss. I'm not going to revive. Why would I do that? Peach does not have a very good
[9739.75s -> 9755.51s]  physical power right now, unfortunately. Although someone's going to level up soon.
[9755.59s -> 9766.30s]  Get up. I'm trying to dodge so bad. I don't want to fight these guys. I don't... I need to get
[9766.30s -> 9789.02s]  a lick to an HP station. Save. Let's check it out. Wait a minute. Hold on. Oh. Uh-huh.
[9790.07s -> 9795.98s]  This is the obstacle course. I remember this. And there's our friendly friend up there.
[9797.53s -> 9823.66s]  I'm happy for this. Not a secret. Not a secret. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I'm just going to
[9823.66s -> 9827.82s]  revive them. I got plenty of these things. I just did a bunch of bosses in a row. What am I going to
[9827.82s -> 9843.24s]  use these for? Oh, sleep sauce. All right. Here's a game you can play right now in your room.
[9843.24s -> 9853.34s]  Try... Say sleep sauce with as much syllabus as you can. Sleep suss. Oh, sleep suss. It's pretty
[9853.34s -> 9902.94s]  funny. That's right. You've run. There we go. Peach level 13. Did you learn any new moves?
[9903.80s -> 9943.78s]  Come back. That is the revive. Nice. What am I supposed to say about this? Thank you for voting.
[9950.97s -> 9968.25s]  58. Oh, come on. I actually do need... No, I don't. Come back. Oh my god. I'm really,
[9968.25s -> 10015.38s]  really impatient. I tried to get away from the fucking bee. Stop fucking this up. All right.
[10015.38s -> 10023.56s]  So here this is... Welcome to the sky bridge. It's a big tourist attraction here. Yeah.
[10024.20s -> 10043.45s]  You want to challenge it? Sure. I'll need five coins. Wait, am I getting minus two
[10043.45s -> 10048.66s]  because it's not... I didn't do Trump. This guy already existed in the universe. You can't do that.
[10049.38s -> 10052.82s]  This guy already had a voice. He existed in the universe. I'm trying to say the next new character.
[10053.54s -> 10067.58s]  It was the Yahoo. No, was it? I thought that was pretty good. You can cross the sky bridge in one
[10067.58s -> 10072.71s]  of three ways. However, if you fall at any time, you lose. On the normal course, you'll make it
[10072.71s -> 10078.55s]  across just by jumping. You'll get five coins for that. On the special course, the blocks will fall
[10078.55s -> 10084.23s]  if your time runs out. You'll get eight coins there. On the expert course, the blocks will fall and
[10084.23s -> 10089.61s]  the jumps are harder. You'll get a frog coin. On all the courses, you'll have to jump and avoid
[10089.61s -> 10096.49s]  the bullet guides. Which course do you want? Normal first. We're going to go one, two, three.
[10097.21s -> 10114.38s]  All right. I got my investment back. Yahoo. You want to double your winnings. Get double the coins
[10114.38s -> 10117.98s]  you make it across in the same course in one attempt. The course is harder and if you fall,
[10117.98s -> 10136.65s]  you won't get any coins. Still want to try? Yeah, let's do it again. Thank you. You want to double
[10136.65s -> 10139.13s]  your winnings. Get double the coins. You make it across in the same course in one attempt.
[10141.13s -> 10164.22s]  Yeah, that was great. Here you go. 20 coins. I want to do it again. I want to do the harder one.
[10164.94s -> 10186.60s]  Okay, let's challenge it. I'll need five coins. Let's do special. Thank you.
[10187.24s -> 10189.64s]  Want to double your winnings. Get double the coins. You make it across the same course in one
[10189.64s -> 10192.20s]  attempt. The course is harder. If you fall, you're going to lose your coins. Let's try it again.
[10193.08s -> 10198.95s]  The audio is half a second behind the video. Why does this keep happening?
[10200.41s -> 10213.53s]  No, I need to pay attention. I swear to god this happens. Like half the time. It's either that or
[10213.53s -> 10228.78s]  I'm being lied to half the time. I panicked. Sorry. Let's do it again. I'll get it this time.
[10231.83s -> 10234.23s]  And then I'm going for the frog coins. I'm going for three frog coins next.
[10234.95s -> 10266.23s]  Give me my frog coin. Two frog coins.
[10293.91s -> 10318.47s]  Oh, what the fuck? That's so infuriating. That's so annoying. I had it too. Do it again. Come on.
[10318.47s -> 10339.53s]  I know I can do this. Three points. No, that's four coins. All right, let's go.
[10340.25s -> 10355.45s]  This is the one. Let's go. This is four frog coins. I need these. Thanks a lot. I'll take it all.
[10357.10s -> 10357.90s]  Four frog coins.
[10358.38s -> 10369.27s]  Ah, haven't been here in a while. I've been busy traveling around.
[10370.07s -> 10379.19s]  Where are you headed? Is it Monstro Town by any chance? Yeah. Okay, listen up. Look for the
[10379.19s -> 10384.71s]  world where the ant pops up and proceed after it. Keep following it and you'll find your way around
[10384.71s -> 10392.15s]  underground. Once there, Monstro Town's just around the corner. I'll see you there.
[10392.79s -> 10425.69s]  I forgot and I get the end. I remembered. Oh shit. I think I poison gassed this.
[10453.70s -> 10460.07s]  I need how much? 2159. That's all right. Let's do a super flame.
[10464.55s -> 10503.18s]  That's not good. 130. There it is. What is it called? About a what? 104 fucking damage. 52.
[10504.14s -> 10523.48s]  Um, just keep the hills up. I can take a maple syrup if I need to. Damn it. Uh oh.
[10524.04s -> 10569.02s]  Staticky is not that bad. 30 exp and a Bowser level up. 120, 109. Not bad. Hey, what is that?
[10569.98s -> 10593.75s]  Hey chat, who's bored? Let's talk. I have a discussion. Talk. Talk to each other. Communicate
[10593.75s -> 10613.85s]  with each other. You should be talking to each other. What was over here? Look, I'll give you a
[10613.93s -> 10624.26s]  discussion, okay? Over easy, over medium, over hard. Why would you choose any of those? Which
[10624.26s -> 10647.18s]  one do you prefer? Now, I need a syrup. Me, I prefer over medium and the reason why I do I like
[10647.18s -> 10652.30s]  over medium is because I don't, when a yolk gets really runny, it just kind of gets all over the
[10652.30s -> 10657.83s]  place. You bite into it and it turns into water on your plate. It's just, you don't, it's kind of,
[10657.83s -> 10664.47s]  I don't like it. Over medium gives a soft yolk, but still it's like almost like a gel. But it's
[10664.47s -> 10668.39s]  hot and it's able to be spread on stuff. You can put it on your toast. You can dip stuff in it.
[10672.84s -> 10696.79s]  Over hard is just too much. Too solid. Poison gas. Only one person got hit by that. I don't believe
[10696.79s -> 10711.10s]  it. I refuse to believe it. I forgot the ants were annoying. They do a ton of damage and they're hard
[10711.10s -> 10746.74s]  to kill. Once again. Ow. Pick me up. Let's do this while we're here. Good. I don't even remember
[10746.74s -> 10752.34s]  which one it was because I had to go to the menu. God. Shit. They just spun around like crazy.
[10753.14s -> 10764.95s]  Oh, another one of these. Come here. Get over here. Come here. Patrick. Patrick, help me.
[10765.59s -> 10784.95s]  It's supposed to be a jellyfish. That's like half of your guy's favorite fucking show.
[10785.51s -> 10846.22s]  It's not mine. It's a pre-30 experience every time. Come on. I gotta hit them all with this.
[10853.80s -> 10882.30s]  Finally. They should die from the poison. At least I hope they do. It's not enough.
[10882.30s -> 10915.35s]  Somebody else is gonna level up here. Going in. What the hell was that? I really wish I had,
[10917.00s -> 10924.06s]  I might switch Malabar for Bowser for this part because I really want to get like 100 damage on
[10924.06s -> 10962.09s]  each one. I think that'll kill them, right? It's 90. 30. No, I think they have 150 each. Sneak us
[10962.09s -> 10972.54s]  through to Monstro Town. Hey, look. Mario's level 13. Look at that magic defense. That's the worst
[10972.54s -> 10978.84s]  out of everybody and that I have in the whole game. Fly far. Do the right thing here. Come on.
[11011.29s -> 11019.40s]  Well, I may as well just press power every time, I think. Can I ask a question? This is a very
[11019.40s -> 11043.58s]  serious question. Is it because the POW symbol is the coolest looking? Is that why? HP is for babies
[11046.49s -> 11053.96s]  because I want you to suffer. Well, we've got a pretty interesting combination here.
[11062.14s -> 11097.58s]  Five seconds. I'm bringing Malo in. Malo for, Malo for Bowser for, just for now. Why'd you do that?
[11097.58s -> 11114.52s]  Really? That's so irritating. All right, let's see if we can get a couple of kills here. I don't have
[11114.52s -> 11123.62s]  enough for Shocker, but how much will Thunderbolt do? Not a lot. I could do it again.
[11126.28s -> 11153.90s]  Did Shocker hit more than one person? I don't remember. Big froggy stick. Too bad it sucks.
[11154.54s -> 11178.95s]  Somebody else. There we go. Gino. Gino's kind of balanced. Magic defense is not great, but that's
[11178.95s -> 11190.71s]  just the nature of the character. Am I gonna play Earthbound? I don't think so. I'm not sure I would
[11190.71s -> 11218.06s]  do Earthbound. Jerma will let you choose one for a Sans impression. I don't, it's fine. You can pick
[11227.16s -> 11264.89s]  only one point. Come on. Stop baiting me. Stop it. Hello again. Isn't this just incredible? It really
[11264.89s -> 11269.98s]  does look like the edge of the world, doesn't it? It's too spooky for me. I'm too scared. I don't
[11269.98s -> 11288.98s]  want to do it. I'm heading back to Monstro Town. It's safe. See ya. This comes into play later.
[11300.15s -> 11310.02s]  Now this time I'm gonna do Maple Syrup because I want to do Shocker on one of you. What's the
[11310.02s -> 11321.05s]  timing on this? I don't know if I got it. I mean, I kind of, you can kind of just drop the Gatorade
[11321.05s -> 11343.22s]  symbol on him. So I don't know when I'm supposed to do that. Watch, ready? All right, it's not really
[11343.22s -> 11350.82s]  the Gatorade symbol. I thought it looked like it for a second. It's not. It's not even close.
[11361.93s -> 11392.79s]  Let's read a mind. I want to see what the ants are thinking. Do as you like. Okay. Pick me up.
[11392.79s -> 11412.30s]  And another level up. No. Oh, I think that's a star down there. I'm super excited. Here we go.
[11423.64s -> 11456.39s]  Oh, I got them all. Yeah. 14. Why would I do a Sans impression? There's no reason to do that.
[11465.03s -> 11480.84s]  Sans. Do Sans. Sans. Please. Please. Please. What? Why does everybody want the Sans voice today?
[11480.84s -> 11485.00s]  I've never seen that. Even when I was playing Undertale, people didn't say do the Sans voice.
[11485.00s -> 11510.82s]  Do the Sans voice. Maybe if you're good. And you guys actually picked the HP. Smart. Let's see if
[11510.82s -> 11540.82s]  you continue to be smart. Yeah, you have to be good for the rest of the stream. And then maybe
[11540.82s -> 11554.06s]  I'll do it at the end. Yeah. Hey, Santa comes on December 24th, not January 2nd. I've been good
[11554.06s -> 11564.33s]  for one day. No, you got to be good all year before he figures it out. You're looking for a star? I'll
[11564.33s -> 11573.61s]  sell you one for 400 coins. Hold on. Let me see. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come back. No, no, no. Wait.
[11573.61s -> 11580.02s]  Did I fuck that up? He's back, right? Yeah. I got, I got plenty of money. I got a ton of money. He's
[11580.02s -> 11589.40s]  still there, right? He's there, right? Oh, fuck me. Come on. Really? I'm going to leave and come back.
[11589.40s -> 11649.88s]  How long ago is that safe? I don't remember how long ago that was. Is it right here? It was right
[11649.88s -> 11684.15s]  here, right? It's literally right here. It was minutes ago. Okay. Thank you. All right. We're
[11684.15s -> 11701.14s]  finally go. All right. I remember what you guys picked. You guys, it was uh, Peach was HP. I
[11701.14s -> 11719.13s]  remember Bowser was power. Here we go. 400 coins. Looking for a star. Yes. Thank you for the star
[11719.13s -> 11732.98s]  and thank you for the like two levels. Let's go. What the hell? Why did I just freeze? I need to
[11732.98s -> 11744.49s]  get them all. I have to kill the thing. All right. Ultra jump has been learned.
[11750.42s -> 11786.95s]  Hey, you happy? Let's go. Like he was so pumped up. Let's go. Yo, let's go. Oh, yeah, dude. Fucking
[11786.95s -> 11805.64s]  hype. Oh, wait, hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I get to pick one now.
[11805.64s -> 11837.00s]  Excuse me. You know, blast caution confused monster himself. He just tried to hit himself
[11837.00s -> 11844.15s]  in the face. I'm sorry. I want you to like to go home and go to bed. 70 fucking three.
[11847.11s -> 11860.22s]  Malo, you fucking toad wannabe. Hey, Malo, you're a fucking toad hat with legs.
[11865.30s -> 11888.25s]  You have to plus two it now. I'm gonna pee. I'll be right back. Dude, let's go. Let's go, dude.
[11888.25s -> 12052.09s]  Dude, let's fucking go, dude. I was testing you guys. I had to see if I did like a
[12052.89s -> 12058.17s]  laugh out loud like boomer joke. Ha ha. And then I ended it with the sands. I did. I needed to see
[12058.17s -> 12076.94s]  what was going to happen. My hypothesis was correct. By the way, let's fucking go, dude.
[12077.98s -> 12116.87s]  Valom temple. For 100 coins, this shortcut will get you back to the surface. Okay. Should I take
[12116.87s -> 12136.18s]  that? I think. Where does it go? To the surface. But is it still available? I'm going to see if
[12136.18s -> 12158.97s]  it's still available. Like, can I? I'm good. What are you guys saying? Vinny is a big Chrono
[12158.97s -> 12166.57s]  Trigger fan and he loves Earthknot. Yeah, well, I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[12168.10s -> 12174.49s]  My brother loves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I cannot fucking believe I
[12174.49s -> 12188.98s]  can buy another star. Okay, what I was gonna say, so I can come back later. What I was saying is I
[12188.98s -> 12192.34s]  love peanut butter and jelly. My brother loves peanut butter and jelly, but my brother hates
[12193.99s -> 12198.95s]  mozzarella sticks and I love mozzarella sticks. No, wait, hold on. That's different. I love
[12198.95s -> 12205.91s]  peanut butter and fluff. My brother hates peanut butter and fluff. Just because you like peanut
[12205.91s -> 12209.67s]  butter doesn't mean you'd like peanut butter. Like the peanut butter is like this just because
[12209.67s -> 12222.23s]  you like sandwiches. You know, relax. It's in there somewhere. You'll find it. Do you want your
[12222.23s -> 12232.28s]  fortune told? It'll cost 50 coins. Oh shit. Oh, what do I do? Hold on. Let's go. Let's go.
[12235.72s -> 12242.94s]  I can't even do it.
[12246.95s -> 12259.13s]  That's so funny to me. The three faces on the wall,
[12259.13s -> 12260.97s]  hit them in any order and you'll receive your fortune.
[12262.33s -> 12277.86s]  All right, I'm gonna say middle, middle, left, right. You want to, no, we're not voting on this
[12277.86s -> 12300.60s]  shit. It's easy. Fine. Oh, I don't know why that's doing it for me. Like a guaranteed minus two
[12300.60s -> 12307.58s]  moment and I can just instantly switch it around. Even if it's a bad sans and it doesn't matter.
[12307.58s -> 12323.94s]  I just say the word eight, eight, eight. I just say eight and it's over. I win. You guys are
[12323.94s -> 12352.23s]  programmed to like that. Okay, let's go. Isn't this what I just said I was gonna do? I can't
[12352.23s -> 12376.07s]  do middle again, so we're going right. If you proceed through the pipe next door, you'll have
[12376.07s -> 12427.32s]  plenty of good things to look forward to. Isn't there a treasure room here if you do it right?
[12427.96s -> 12455.40s]  I just thought there was. Snowy. Let's do snowy. Holy shit, that's cool. Very cute.
[12455.96s -> 12467.83s]  You think they're putting fishes and Doritos in your comments? They're gonna make me read them?
[12467.83s -> 12497.90s]  No. That's a lot of coins. Double the coins. Okay, guys, I'll get this one.
[12499.74s -> 12521.06s]  I'm just gonna fucking guess. I don't care. Got them all back. Don't worry.
[12521.06s -> 12529.74s]  Nice. I haven't, by the way, I have enough frog coins to get the experience one, which is probably
[12529.74s -> 12534.42s]  the best one to get. The yellow tile will get you to the next room. Your fortune determines which
[12534.42s -> 12539.45s]  room you'll arrive at. If you're lucky, you'll run into Baylum and Monstro Town will be just beyond
[12539.45s -> 12563.96s]  him. I'm so hungry. Wish I had some days. If you're lucky. Get it. Oh, well, I don't have Bowser.
[12564.68s -> 12581.02s]  I don't have Bowser. I don't think I can reveal this thing. Can I? Psychopath. I have a secret.
[12581.50s -> 12595.40s]  You have a secret. I don't think I can do this. I have to run. It's the gas. There's no way I can
[12595.40s -> 12604.89s]  reveal this. Unless... than to bolt. Let's try something. Let's just... let's just not go.
[12607.98s -> 12640.49s]  No. No, there it is. And just beyond Baylum will be Monstro Town. That was almost... uh-oh.
[12641.13s -> 12655.88s]  Bowser's coming back for the Baylum fight. All right, so I need to put some Scarecrow
[12655.88s -> 12685.90s]  repellent on. All right, uh, let's just... let's do this now. Let's get Mallow out of here
[12686.70s -> 12695.24s]  for Bowser. Let's make sure somebody has a true form pin on. Mutant Poison. I don't have a true
[12695.24s -> 12705.10s]  form. Who has the true form pin? Do you know? Let's give the true form pin to the person
[12705.10s -> 12713.34s]  that needs it the most. The person that needs to be able to stay alive and heal everybody.
[12713.34s -> 12733.43s]  Wait. You look so tasty. I think I'll have just a snack.
[12734.31s -> 12758.22s]  Mm-hmm. Just keep it going. I'll never forget a taste. In fact, I can clone someone
[12758.22s -> 12765.37s]  after just one slurp. Take a look. You all look so delicious. Well, how do you taste?
[12768.65s -> 12790.98s]  Tastes peachy. There we are. No, I ain't gonna do it again.
[12792.50s -> 12802.31s]  You all look so delicious. But how do you taste? See, the developers... there's a lot of controversy
[12802.31s -> 12818.39s]  on when this happened. I didn't even do it. Come on, give me some slack. I ironically did it. I
[12818.39s -> 12827.29s]  ironically did it. All right, I need to stop farming minus two. So this is going to be the
[12827.29s -> 12861.58s]  lowest rated string of the year. They all sleep? Holy fuck, that was a lot. How do you taste?
[12862.30s -> 12892.50s]  Always get rid of the clone first. How are we doing on health? Snap out of it. Somebody... okay,
[12892.58s -> 12898.31s]  uh, we're fine. I have an able juice. I might as well just use it
[12898.31s -> 12933.11s]  because I need you. Let's just do group hug. Do the ultra jump again. 240. God, keep eating
[12933.67s -> 12953.37s]  peach. That's fine. How is it gonna kill peach in one hit? Do it again, Mario. You know what to do.
[12953.37s -> 12973.83s]  One, two, three, six, seven, fifteen. No, not again. I'm starving. Time to go home for dinner.
[12974.71s -> 13002.42s]  Goodbye, boys and girls. What am I... what is going on here? Trash loot. Yeah, yeah.
[13008.97s -> 13018.07s]  Oh, hey. Hello again. That pipe is a shortcut to my house. Beautiful house. Monstro Town.
[13019.08s -> 13033.42s]  I'll see you there. Monstro Town. I love Monstro Town. It's great.
[13033.42s -> 13052.52s]  Weapon and armor shop. Just a minute. I'll be there in a second. Oh, my.
[13054.84s -> 13061.59s]  Goomba, what are you doing here? Well, Bowser, it's been ages, hasn't it?
[13062.74s -> 13067.70s]  Sorry about going haywire on you. I ran away because I was scared to fight Smitty.
[13068.76s -> 13075.62s]  A lot has happened since then, but look how far I've come. I'm managing this store now. And look,
[13076.26s -> 13087.43s]  here are my little ones. Come on, show your manners and greet Uncle Bowser. Although I can't
[13087.43s -> 13093.03s]  fight for you, I still have some items we could use. Maybe you'd fight it in your heart to forgive
[13093.03s -> 13105.08s]  me if I could help you get equipped. Don't worry. I'm not angry with you. I've got new troops now,
[13105.08s -> 13110.44s]  and we're going to reclaim my castle. You can go on with your life here. I wish you the best.
[13111.32s -> 13123.50s]  Well, I really appreciate that. What can I get you? Oh, you know what I'm getting here.
[13129.67s -> 13158.55s]  Spiked Link Courage Shell. 155. Let's go. Courage Shell is... Magic Defense Down. What is it here?
[13159.35s -> 13166.63s]  53. That's just... that's just not very good, but I kind of...
[13171.18s -> 13177.82s]  How does Mario have 100 and fucking 50? No. He's 144 attack. Why does he suck?
[13178.78s -> 13209.61s]  Give the amulet to Bowser. No, don't do that. I need some more of these. How many do I have?
[13210.33s -> 13212.65s]  I have a lot of pick-me-ups. I'm never going to buy any more of these again.
[13213.61s -> 13232.52s]  Okay. Nice to see you. Goodbye. Feel free to rest here. The Three Musty Fears. I remember this.
[13233.32s -> 13253.77s]  Nice to meet you. I'm Grieper. I'm the Big Boo. And I'm Dry Bones. We are the Three Musty Fears.
[13257.42s -> 13265.64s]  He's sleeping. Boy, he sure is. Check those bubbles coming out of his nose.
[13266.36s -> 13276.39s]  Maybe he can still hear us while he's asleep. Hey, you. We want to play around and find the
[13276.47s -> 13285.42s]  flag. Right. We'll each hide a flag somewhere around the world. Find all three flags,
[13286.22s -> 13296.04s]  and you'll get an awesome prize. We'll go and hide the flag. See you when we get back. Dumbledore.
[13302.62s -> 13307.34s]  I looked over and saw Dumbledore. I just... it was one comment that said Dumbledore,
[13307.34s -> 13318.28s]  and I fucking lost my mind. They'll be back. Our first year students. They will show us
[13319.58s -> 13328.42s]  very wonderful things. I'm back. I hid my flag behind a wooden flower. I know what that is.
[13328.42s -> 13337.96s]  I'm home. My flag's under a green bed. I'm back. You'll never guess my spot. It's between
[13337.96s -> 13345.06s]  O and an A. Ladies and gentlemen, the first flag is behind the wooden rose in Rosedown. The second
[13345.06s -> 13350.58s]  flag is on Yoshi's Island between the O and the A of Goll, and the green bed, if you believe it
[13350.58s -> 13369.22s]  or not, happens to be Super Mario's own green bed in his house. Did you know? Our flags are
[13369.22s -> 13376.68s]  invisible, so search very carefully when you think you've found the spot, Harry. Don't forget what we
[13376.68s -> 13398.92s]  told you. Go. Time it. Time right now. Start the time. No, wait. Start the time when I... wait.
[13400.07s -> 13405.59s]  I'm not... why am I going this way? I'm going the wrong way. Hold on. Don't start that timer yet.
[13406.31s -> 13450.79s]  Hold on. Where's the door? It's this door right here. Go. Reaper flag. Big Boo flag.
[13463.82s -> 13478.28s]  What is that? It's not his name? His name's not Reaper? Dry Bones flag. All the flags got.
[13478.28s -> 13521.29s]  Call it when I get back in the bed. And... time. Good job. You found all three flags. Hey, you're
[13521.29s -> 13530.07s]  not half bad. You did pretty well. We had a great time, too. Thanks for playing our game. In fact,
[13530.15s -> 13536.31s]  we just got off lunch and you did it. Not even. We were on our way to lunch and my phone buzzed.
[13536.31s -> 13557.45s]  Who fucking helped you? The grand prize giveaway. Don't forget what we told you. What did I get?
[13561.54s -> 13589.98s]  I got a great item bad smell. Where is it? Oh, there it is. Ghost medal. Raise his defense
[13589.98s -> 13619.10s]  while attacking. Yup, yup, yup. Yup, yup, yup. Yup, yup. Yup. Yup. It's been sealed.
[13624.78s -> 13630.47s]  So the super jump is your specialty, right? Those multiple jumps of yours are pretty amazing.
[13630.47s -> 13636.73s]  I heard that your record for consecutive jumps stands at 12. How do you do it? Jump
[13636.73s -> 13646.33s]  more than 30 times in a row and I'll give you a prize. You're a terrible. Rumor has it that you
[13646.33s -> 13651.22s]  You're a quiet and accomplished jumper.
[13651.22s -> 13653.74s]  I may be out-jumped, but you're totally out-pumped.
[13656.21s -> 13658.07s]  A strong, silent type, eh?
[13660.41s -> 13662.05s]  Don't you dig these vibes?
[13663.97s -> 13667.25s]  Don't you dig these vibes?
[13667.25s -> 13670.71s]  It's really weird sometimes I hear the guy next door.
[13670.71s -> 13674.80s]  He's always mumbling about a crystal in evil.
[13674.80s -> 13678.08s]  Isn't a crystal some kind of shiny rock or something?
[13678.08s -> 13698.83s]  I know I've seen those somewhere.
[13698.83s -> 13702.93s]  Oh my, a traveler from afar.
[13702.97s -> 13706.05s]  Welcome to Monstro Town, where many of our kind mingle.
[13706.05s -> 13712.39s]  I'm the landlady, you monster, I'm a,
[13712.39s -> 13714.47s]  a star, you say?
[13714.47s -> 13717.74s]  Oh, you're here to see our star.
[13717.74s -> 13719.40s]  She's upstairs.
[13719.40s -> 13731.68s]  So feel free to go and take a look for yourself.
[13731.68s -> 13734.72s]  Sometimes if you jump in the right places,
[13734.72s -> 13738.62s]  a treasure box will pop out of thin air.
[13738.62s -> 13741.07s]  Anything like this ever happen to you?
[13741.07s -> 13744.19s]  These treasure boxes are known as surprise boxes
[13744.19s -> 13747.18s]  because they appear out of nowhere.
[13748.02s -> 13754.80s]  They didn't get found of all, but there are still 32 left.
[13754.80s -> 13759.23s]  I've been all around the world, almost every country,
[13759.23s -> 13761.40s]  but the strangest person I met
[13761.40s -> 13764.14s]  is this old geezer in Rosedown.
[13764.14s -> 13780.20s]  He's really weird, but definitely worth meeting.
[13780.20s -> 13788.00s]  That's the song, that's the Todofsky song.
[13788.00s -> 13806.83s]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, somebody screenshot that, okay.
[13806.83s -> 13807.67s]  So what do you think?
[13807.67s -> 13809.67s]  Our star is adorable.
[13809.67s -> 13811.59s]  She's so talented too.
[13811.59s -> 13814.64s]  Folks come to see her from afar.
[13815.40s -> 13818.76s]  Geez, starbees?
[13818.76s -> 13822.42s]  Oh, starpiece, I'm not familiar with it.
[13822.42s -> 13825.58s]  So you came all the way out here to search for a starpiece.
[13825.58s -> 13827.62s]  Must be really important.
[13827.62s -> 13829.62s]  This is the last place on the land.
[13829.62s -> 13833.65s]  If you can't find it here, then the only place left is up.
[13833.65s -> 13835.63s]  What?
[13835.63s -> 13837.59s]  So you wanna go up there?
[13837.59s -> 13839.49s]  Oh, you're an open book.
[13839.49s -> 13841.03s]  Okay, here's what you need to do.
[13841.03s -> 13844.19s]  There's a secret passage to the sky had been valid,
[13844.19s -> 13846.51s]  but first you must scale the cliff beyond the desert
[13846.51s -> 13847.79s]  to get there.
[13847.79s -> 13849.35s]  Since you're such a nice guy,
[13849.35s -> 13854.32s]  I clearly introduce you to someone that can help you.
[13854.32s -> 13865.82s]  Sky troopers, I need you.
[13865.82s -> 13868.80s]  What was our flying time, troops?
[13868.80s -> 13874.09s]  8.52 seconds, Sergeant.
[13874.09s -> 13876.44s]  Sky troopers reporting for duty.
[13876.44s -> 13879.24s]  Ask me anything.
[13879.24s -> 13882.20s]  We are 0.52 seconds late.
[13882.20s -> 13888.54s]  I hold myself personally accountable for the delay, ma'am.
[13888.54s -> 13891.78s]  Still as rigid as ever about your rules and regulations.
[13891.78s -> 13895.18s]  No need to bother with the protocol around me, Sergeant.
[13895.18s -> 13898.62s]  I've got a favor to ask of you.
[13898.62s -> 13899.46s]  Yes, ma'am.
[13899.46s -> 13902.18s]  Anything we can do for a civilian.
[13902.18s -> 13903.54s]  This fellow here really wants to,
[13903.54s -> 13906.63s]  really wants to get to Bean Valley.
[13906.63s -> 13910.38s]  Could you help him scale the cliff?
[13910.38s -> 13911.46s]  Understood, ma'am.
[13911.46s -> 13914.10s]  The orders are get mustache over the cliff.
[13914.10s -> 13916.65s]  We will succeed.
[13916.65s -> 13919.53s]  We will now deploy ourselves to the cliff it lands in.
[13919.53s -> 13925.15s]  Troopers, keep a tight formation.
[13925.15s -> 13930.00s]  We have liftoff.
[13930.00s -> 13932.44s]  They're odd, but trustworthy.
[13932.44s -> 13935.96s]  Good luck with your search.
[13935.96s -> 13937.58s]  Hope you find your star.
[13945.41s -> 13949.75s]  No, no, react harder.
[13949.75s -> 13952.83s]  React harder.
[13952.83s -> 13970.10s]  Turn him off.
[13970.10s -> 13971.10s]  No, it's not down yet.
[13974.80s -> 13978.64s]  Don't you dig these vibes.
[13978.64s -> 13979.76s]  Don't you dig these vibes.
[13979.76s -> 13981.04s]  Is it down?
[13981.04s -> 13982.00s]  Another little tip for you.
[13982.00s -> 13982.88s]  That's how you get the key.
[13982.88s -> 13984.10s]  Got the temple key.
[13985.00s -> 13986.04s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[13986.04s -> 13986.88s]  I did.
[13986.88s -> 13988.16s]  I have it.
[13988.16s -> 13989.00s]  I do.
[13990.77s -> 13993.19s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[13993.19s -> 13994.66s]  Okay.
[13994.66s -> 13998.30s]  Now I'm going to go up here
[13998.30s -> 14001.96s]  to meet the best character in the game.
[14001.96s -> 14004.18s]  Not this guy.
[14004.18s -> 14005.98s]  Who is it?
[14006.02s -> 14009.45s]  Sorry, but the Sensei's not in.
[14009.45s -> 14011.69s]  Oh my God.
[14011.69s -> 14015.35s]  Ha ha, oh my God.
[14015.35s -> 14019.42s]  Jagger?
[14019.42s -> 14023.06s]  Bowser, I haven't seen you for so long.
[14023.06s -> 14024.40s]  I've been studying here at the Dojo
[14024.40s -> 14027.01s]  under the Sensei jinx because,
[14027.01s -> 14028.05s]  to tell you the truth,
[14028.05s -> 14030.72s]  I knew I couldn't beat Smitty.
[14030.72s -> 14032.22s]  That's why I'm here now.
[14032.22s -> 14038.22s]  Someday I'm going to return and make you proud.
[14038.22s -> 14040.12s]  Don't worry about me.
[14040.12s -> 14042.39s]  I've got two new troopers now
[14042.39s -> 14044.65s]  and we're going to take back my castle.
[14044.65s -> 14045.99s]  You stick to your guns.
[14046.83s -> 14051.68s]  Train like there's no tomorrow.
[14051.68s -> 14054.60s]  My Sensei's out right now, but he'll be back shortly.
[14054.60s -> 14059.20s]  In the meantime, will you accept a challenge from me?
[14059.20s -> 14060.40s]  Sure.
[14060.40s -> 14061.24s]  Okay, great.
[14061.24s -> 14062.06s]  Nice.
[14062.06s -> 14063.72s]  You know that I'm not going to make it easy for you though,
[14063.72s -> 14076.72s]  right?
[14076.72s -> 14078.12s]  Bang, bang, bang.
[14078.12s -> 14082.25s]  Oh, that hurts my eyes.
[14082.25s -> 14096.18s]  Every time I attack with Bowser now.
[14096.18s -> 14106.84s]  Oh, no, that sucks.
[14106.84s -> 14109.15s]  Terror punch.
[14109.15s -> 14114.99s]  Dead.
[14114.99s -> 14116.96s]  I found the solution.
[14116.96s -> 14119.08s]  Every time it goes,
[14119.12s -> 14120.04s]  just close your eyes,
[14120.04s -> 14122.52s]  just hard blink and you won't see it.
[14122.52s -> 14124.36s]  So just go blink, blink, blink,
[14124.36s -> 14125.94s]  and you won't see at all.
[14125.94s -> 14133.93s]  That's what I'm going to do.
[14133.93s -> 14134.97s]  Yikes.
[14134.97s -> 14137.50s]  I guess that was to be expected.
[14137.50s -> 14142.66s]  Mario, you're a top-notch fighter.
[14142.66s -> 14149.48s]  You did well for your inexperience, Jago.
[14149.48s -> 14153.56s]  Sensei, have you been here all along?
[14153.56s -> 14155.10s]  Hmm.
[14155.10s -> 14157.66s]  You felt my ki, didn't you?
[14157.66s -> 14159.10s]  Not bad for a novice.
[14164.59s -> 14165.80s]  No.
[14165.80s -> 14169.36s]  Your fighting style isn't as foolproof as you think.
[14171.07s -> 14184.95s]  I'll accept a challenge any day.
[14184.95s -> 14191.72s]  You wish to challenge me?
[14191.72s -> 14201.24s]  All right, let's see what you're capable of.
[14201.24s -> 14202.08s]  All right, here's the strategy.
[14202.08s -> 14205.33s]  Ready?
[14205.33s -> 14206.15s]  Block now.
[14206.15s -> 14206.99s]  Yep.
[14206.99s -> 14207.83s]  That does a lot of damage.
[14207.83s -> 14210.36s]  You have to block right when you can hit the ground.
[14210.36s -> 14212.08s]  Got it.
[14212.08s -> 14212.90s]  All right, ready?
[14212.90s -> 14240.33s]  So blink, blink, blink.
[14240.33s -> 14242.42s]  Triple kick.
[14242.42s -> 14243.26s]  Block.
[14243.26s -> 14244.90s]  I remember these timings.
[14245.22s -> 14251.72s]  They were really annoying to get used to.
[14251.72s -> 14253.08s]  Shit does so much damage though.
[14253.08s -> 14254.00s]  I have to keep using it.
[14254.00s -> 14255.04s]  I'm sorry.
[14255.04s -> 14258.00s]  Actual real, like no jokes at all.
[14258.00s -> 14259.84s]  Like if you're sensitive to flashes of light and stuff,
[14259.84s -> 14261.88s]  like that's going to happen for a while.
[14261.88s -> 14276.77s]  So seriously though, like take care of yourself, right?
[14276.77s -> 14280.60s]  Battle her up.
[14280.60s -> 14283.67s]  Oh shit.
[14283.67s -> 14294.48s]  I need her.
[14294.48s -> 14300.08s]  Six.
[14300.08s -> 14302.64s]  Again.
[14302.64s -> 14304.32s]  You don't get to go twice.
[14304.32s -> 14317.68s]  That's not fair.
[14317.68s -> 14318.52s]  Group hug.
[14325.18s -> 14332.96s]  Woo hoo.
[14332.96s -> 14340.48s]  Simply amazing.
[14340.48s -> 14342.52s]  I guess I underestimated you.
[14342.52s -> 14344.48s]  You packed quite a punch,
[14344.48s -> 14346.48s]  but don't let it go to your head
[14346.48s -> 14349.68s]  because I had let you have that round.
[14349.68s -> 14355.38s]  Let's have a rematch.
[14355.38s -> 14364.94s]  This becomes very, very, very hard.
[14364.94s -> 14367.90s]  All right, you asked for it and no crying if you get hurt.
[14367.90s -> 14378.60s]  Quick silver.
[14378.60s -> 14388.72s]  He missed.
[14388.72s -> 14389.56s]  Good block.
[14389.56s -> 14392.74s]  And even if that would have been a one hit kill.
[14392.74s -> 14403.48s]  You see, you see what I'm up against here?
[14403.52s -> 14406.12s]  That was a gamer Jupiter?
[14406.12s -> 14407.52s]  What the heck are you talking about?
[14407.52s -> 14408.52s]  Oh my fucking God.
[14408.52s -> 14415.65s]  I looked at, let me re-chat and take a hundred damage.
[14415.65s -> 14421.02s]  Yeah, I'm a little under level for this part.
[14421.02s -> 14427.86s]  I still might be able to do it though.
[14427.86s -> 14430.78s]  There's a third phase that you actually need to be
[14430.78s -> 14433.38s]  like at least level 15 to 20 to do it.
[14433.38s -> 14449.22s]  Cause he will just kill you.
[14449.22s -> 14451.44s]  Zero.
[14451.44s -> 14459.90s]  Well, well.
[14459.90s -> 14462.47s]  Just perfect block every time.
[14462.47s -> 14464.59s]  I mean, that's true, but you still take damage.
[14464.59s -> 14472.13s]  And yeah, he has a move that instantly kills somebody.
[14472.13s -> 14475.29s]  That move quick silver, I believe is a guaranteed kill.
[14475.29s -> 14484.85s]  Or it brings you down to one.
[14484.85s -> 14486.57s]  You can see me through a telescope.
[14488.58s -> 14494.94s]  Well, I hope you're enjoying fucking space.
[14494.94s -> 14507.35s]  I missed it.
[14507.35s -> 14510.34s]  Didn't even need to do that, but I did it anyways.
[14510.34s -> 14511.90s]  All right, here we go, phase two.
[14511.90s -> 14525.78s]  I'm gonna do like 10 damage to him now.
[14525.78s -> 14530.76s]  Fuck man, that is actually bothering me.
[14530.76s -> 14535.99s]  Blocked it.
[14535.99s -> 14539.11s]  I really am trying to time the blinks and it's working,
[14539.11s -> 14545.47s]  but I might have to get rid of Bowser for a little while.
[14545.47s -> 14568.39s]  You know what I'm saying?
[14568.39s -> 14590.55s]  We're gonna have to use him as parts.
[14590.55s -> 14602.17s]  31.
[14602.17s -> 14606.52s]  Miss.
[14606.52s -> 14607.96s]  64 damage.
[14607.96s -> 14612.40s]  What the fuck?
[14612.40s -> 14615.67s]  That really angers me.
[14615.67s -> 14627.26s]  That really makes me upset about that.
[14627.26s -> 14640.16s]  Oh, this simply amazing.
[14640.16s -> 14643.40s]  I simply just can't believe.
[14643.40s -> 14645.44s]  Still haven't had enough.
[14645.44s -> 14649.36s]  It isn't often that I have someone this competitive to spar with.
[14649.36s -> 14650.52s]  All right.
[14650.52s -> 14652.80s]  This match will be the one that counts.
[14652.80s -> 14663.30s]  Since I'm placing my reputation on the line.
[14663.30s -> 14666.24s]  I'll go for it.
[14666.24s -> 14670.68s]  I need a better team though.
[14670.68s -> 14672.08s]  Sorry Bowser, you gotta go.
[14672.08s -> 14680.02s]  Like I just can't look at that anymore.
[14680.02s -> 14681.74s]  I need a, no, no, no, no.
[14681.74s -> 14683.82s]  I can't, I'm not ready.
[14683.82s -> 14685.30s]  I'm not ready.
[14685.30s -> 14686.14s]  I'll be back.
[14686.14s -> 14698.87s]  I'm not ready.
[14698.87s -> 14713.18s]  Where the hell am I going?
[14713.18s -> 14715.72s]  Lands in.
[14715.72s -> 14716.56s]  I'm gonna go back.
[14716.56s -> 14719.80s]  Oh wait, just, I need a few more levels.
[14719.80s -> 14732.81s]  I need a few more levels.
[14732.81s -> 14735.92s]  And I did say I was gonna remove Bowser.
[14735.92s -> 14737.94s]  And I did.
[14737.94s -> 14743.72s]  I'm pretty smart.
[14743.72s -> 14748.07s]  Now go to the equip section.
[14748.07s -> 14752.19s]  We need the work pants and the ghost medal from you Bowser.
[14752.19s -> 14755.40s]  Thanks.
[14755.40s -> 14758.13s]  We've got the double punch on.
[14758.13s -> 14761.29s]  Work pants and the ghost medal.
[14773.88s -> 14787.58s]  Out there.
[14787.58s -> 14789.38s]  Do I need a break?
[14789.38s -> 14792.68s]  Um, I'm good.
[14792.68s -> 14796.14s]  I'm good guys.
[14796.14s -> 14799.82s]  I ate a piece of salmon earlier.
[14799.82s -> 14800.82s]  I could literally,
[14800.82s -> 14821.05s]  I could literally lift up a car right now.
[14821.05s -> 14822.97s]  There's gotta be, I don't remember.
[14855.32s -> 14858.04s]  Caution, confused monster.
[14859.58s -> 14860.42s]  The yellow one.
[14860.42s -> 14878.16s]  Don't hit me.
[14878.16s -> 14879.00s]  What does it mean?
[14879.00s -> 14879.82s]  What does it mean no balls?
[14879.82s -> 14881.00s]  What are we talking about?
[14881.00s -> 14887.23s]  What's going on with you guys?
[14887.23s -> 14890.11s]  That was an incredible room.
[14891.40s -> 14892.60s]  I don't want to fight that.
[14892.60s -> 14909.66s]  Get out of the way.
[14909.66s -> 14921.57s]  I hate this.
[14921.69s -> 14925.50s]  Ah.
[14925.50s -> 14926.34s]  Gino Blast.
[14926.34s -> 14936.96s]  Here we go.
[14936.96s -> 14937.80s]  And that, ladies and gentlemen,
[14937.80s -> 14946.66s]  is why Gino is best character in the game.
[14946.66s -> 14953.84s]  Toaster learns mute.
[14953.84s -> 14955.76s]  And he still has one more move for Gino Flash.
[14955.76s -> 14960.28s]  Gino Blast, Gino World, Gino Boost.
[14960.28s -> 14965.04s]  We're talking about standard B, side B, down B, up B,
[14965.04s -> 14966.48s]  final smash.
[14966.48s -> 14968.20s]  Get on it, Nintendo.
[14968.20s -> 14969.68s]  He's made for that game.
[14969.68s -> 15000.05s]  That's the only reason why he made this long ago.
[15000.05s -> 15009.36s]  67.
[15009.40s -> 15010.24s]  More frog coins?
[15010.24s -> 15033.23s]  Can I accumulate more frog coins?
[15033.23s -> 15052.62s]  Yeah, let's double it up.
[15052.62s -> 15056.77s]  Double it up.
[15056.77s -> 15058.29s]  Four more frog coins.
[15058.29s -> 15060.98s]  You can farm frog coins here.
[15060.98s -> 15073.55s]  That'd be pretty sick.
[15073.55s -> 15078.30s]  Four frog coins.
[15078.30s -> 15079.62s]  Here we go.
[15079.62s -> 15081.62s]  Let's climb the mountain.
[15088.08s -> 15091.60s]  Which way is it again?
[15091.60s -> 15097.95s]  Which way is it again?
[15097.95s -> 15099.47s]  Over this way.
[15099.47s -> 15104.53s]  I think it is.
[15104.53s -> 15109.26s]  Over this way, I think.
[15109.26s -> 15110.10s]  There it is.
[15110.10s -> 15117.36s]  Okay.
[15117.36s -> 15118.18s]  Ten Hut.
[15118.18s -> 15120.10s]  All troops in positions.
[15120.10s -> 15121.86s]  Mario, your mission is to scale the cliff
[15121.86s -> 15141.38s]  by jumping shell to shell.
[15141.38s -> 15142.22s]  Don't give up.
[15142.22s -> 15143.06s]  Sure and steady does it.
[15143.06s -> 15144.97s]  Try it again.
[15144.97s -> 15145.81s]  It's timed, by the way.
[15145.81s -> 15163.85s]  That's why I'm doing this.
[15163.85s -> 15165.13s]  I can't get on that one.
[15165.13s -> 15177.58s]  I know I can.
[15177.58s -> 15178.42s]  I know you can skip one.
[15178.42s -> 15185.98s]  Maybe you can't.
[15185.98s -> 15216.95s]  Oh my God.
[15216.95s -> 15217.77s]  That's a pretty good time.
[15217.77s -> 15218.61s]  Mission accomplished.
[15218.61s -> 15232.13s]  Last time, 13.9 seconds.
[15232.13s -> 15233.09s]  Let me do 12 seconds.
[15233.09s -> 15243.96s]  Shit.
[15243.96s -> 15244.78s]  Ah, that was close.
[15244.78s -> 15248.30s]  Again.
[15248.30s -> 15259.65s]  That could have been probably 10 seconds.
[15259.65s -> 15261.05s]  I'm hitting the shell over there.
[15261.05s -> 15275.72s]  Get out of here.
[15275.72s -> 15276.56s]  I don't care.
[15276.56s -> 15277.38s]  I got the frog coin.
[15277.38s -> 15305.59s]  Who gives a shit?
[15305.59s -> 15306.43s]  Let's go.
[15306.43s -> 15307.41s]  Ooh.
[15307.41s -> 15309.56s]  That's gonna be good.
[15309.56s -> 15311.28s]  Distinguishing work, soldier.
[15311.28s -> 15312.26s]  Here's the next best thing.
[15312.26s -> 15317.15s]  A Troopa pin.
[15317.15s -> 15320.60s]  Got it.
[15320.60s -> 15324.39s]  Grants Troopa confidence.
[15324.39s -> 15333.40s]  Sure does.
[15333.40s -> 15340.36s]  But what does that mean?
[15340.36s -> 15354.72s]  What does that mean?
[15354.72s -> 15364.80s]  Beanvale.
[15364.80s -> 15367.63s]  It's 20 speed, is it?
[15367.63s -> 15369.27s]  What is the speed stat even for?
[15369.27s -> 15381.76s]  Missing when somebody misses you?
[15381.76s -> 15382.68s]  You hate this song.
[15382.68s -> 15383.52s]  Why?
[15383.52s -> 15387.37s]  This is a great song.
[15387.37s -> 15391.20s]  Wait.
[15391.20s -> 15413.70s]  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[15413.70s -> 15414.54s]  Time for a nap.
[15421.75s -> 15422.75s]  Aim sucks.
[15422.75s -> 15424.95s]  Am I actually seeing game sucks?
[15424.95s -> 15426.51s]  I don't believe it.
[15426.51s -> 15428.23s]  No, you're not actually doing that.
[15437.54s -> 15443.99s]  That this is, this is the Michael Jordan of video games.
[15443.99s -> 15447.43s]  What, really?
[15447.43s -> 15461.62s]  Crusher.
[15461.62s -> 15462.72s]  So overrated.
[15467.04s -> 15469.76s]  You're actually talking about one of the best NBA players
[15469.76s -> 15475.05s]  to ever live.
[15475.05s -> 15488.98s]  Overrated.
[15488.98s -> 15496.11s]  I'd be more invested if you did playthroughs of Paper Mario.
[15496.11s -> 15502.44s]  This is, this is, this is, this is Paper Mario.
[15502.80s -> 15505.32s]  The only difference is it's like real game
[15505.32s -> 15507.08s]  that came out before Paper Mario.
[15507.08s -> 15512.12s]  You are playing Paper Mario's father.
[15512.12s -> 15516.71s]  Paper Mario's dad.
[15516.71s -> 15519.23s]  Everything that Paper Mario learned from dad,
[15519.23s -> 15526.69s]  he learned from his dad.
[15526.69s -> 15554.18s]  In fact, some would argue that dad was a little quicker.
[15554.18s -> 15557.10s]  Fighting over what is better.
[15557.10s -> 15562.41s]  They're all on the same team.
[15562.41s -> 15563.85s]  You're on the same team.
[15571.65s -> 15574.97s]  Otter Fiend, thanks for the five community subs, Otter.
[15574.97s -> 15577.45s]  Dropping five subs here, thank you.
[15577.45s -> 15580.68s]  Appreciate it.
[15580.68s -> 15585.68s]  Five community subs.
[15585.68s -> 15588.28s]  I remember something about this.
[15588.28s -> 15589.86s]  This is important.
[15589.86s -> 15590.70s]  This is important.
[15590.70s -> 15592.70s]  Something important here.
[15592.70s -> 15597.26s]  With either the, something here.
[15597.26s -> 15599.06s]  Something here, there's something here.
[15599.06s -> 15602.87s]  It's very important for something.
[15602.87s -> 15619.86s]  The seed, something.
[15619.86s -> 15623.02s]  There's an item that I need to pick up here.
[15623.02s -> 15625.96s]  I just forget what it is.
[15625.96s -> 15628.60s]  And it's the most important thing in the whole game.
[15628.60s -> 15630.00s]  That is a 200 fucking name.
[15640.12s -> 15641.58s]  Damn it.
[15641.58s -> 15642.40s]  Damn it.
[15642.40s -> 15648.74s]  I can't ever get that again.
[15648.74s -> 15651.29s]  It's in one of these.
[15651.29s -> 15680.07s]  I can't screw this up.
[15680.07s -> 15685.58s]  Mods to the rescue, what was going on?
[15685.58s -> 15686.66s]  Everybody just chill.
[15698.04s -> 15714.30s]  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
[15714.30s -> 15718.26s]  Now I'm not gonna do the Sans voice.
[15718.26s -> 15722.30s]  I'm sorry, but I'm not doing the Sans voice anymore
[15722.30s -> 15723.58s]  because of this.
[15723.58s -> 15728.58s]  I saw some, we apparently had an issue in the chat room
[15728.62s -> 15750.76s]  here and I told you guys to behave.
[15750.76s -> 15754.73s]  Punish us all.
[15754.73s -> 15756.79s]  All right, is this the, this is it, this is it.
[15756.79s -> 15761.06s]  All right, something happens here.
[15761.06s -> 15763.73s]  That's what happens here.
[15763.73s -> 15775.36s]  Shouldn't have known.
[15775.36s -> 15781.16s]  That's a lot of damage.
[15781.16s -> 15782.00s]  Are we on health?
[15782.00s -> 15783.89s]  We're okay.
[15783.89s -> 15785.25s]  Mute.
[15785.25s -> 15786.21s]  What is that?
[15786.21s -> 15787.09s]  What can I do with that?
[15787.09s -> 15791.69s]  Mute.
[15791.69s -> 15811.88s]  Will this work?
[15811.88s -> 15834.47s]  420, Jesus.
[15834.51s -> 15860.78s]  Mute that motherfucker right now.
[15860.78s -> 15863.43s]  There it is.
[15863.43s -> 15869.55s]  Ooh, that's it.
[15869.55s -> 15873.14s]  Group hug time.
[15873.14s -> 15874.90s]  Mario's a god now.
[15874.90s -> 15889.94s]  Yeah, Mario's a god now.
[15889.94s -> 15894.11s]  150, goodbye.
[15894.11s -> 15899.03s]  150 coins and you got a nothing.
[15900.66s -> 15902.68s]  You got nothing.
[15902.68s -> 15906.20s]  There's something, frog coin, there's something in here.
[15906.20s -> 15908.32s]  I think this is some, there's a secret in here.
[15908.32s -> 15910.72s]  I know there's something going on in this one.
[15915.74s -> 15916.58s]  That's not it.
[15927.90s -> 15929.38s]  Maybe I'll see it soon.
[15938.72s -> 15939.96s]  Free Wonka bar?
[15943.15s -> 15944.79s]  You can't get Wonka bars anymore.
[15946.39s -> 15948.83s]  I don't know why they ever decided that that was a good idea.
[15948.83s -> 15966.93s]  Cause they're awesome.
[15966.93s -> 15969.33s]  Yeah, some company bought them up and liquidated them.
[15969.33s -> 15973.19s]  All right, here's Mario.
[15973.19s -> 15975.40s]  Pretty good.
[15975.40s -> 15989.05s]  What do you guys think?
[15989.05s -> 15993.90s]  Why even do it?
[15993.90s -> 16006.21s]  Gino's attack is actually getting really, really good.
[16006.21s -> 16009.46s]  50% clicking on the right flower.
[16009.46s -> 16019.30s]  Nice.
[16019.34s -> 16022.34s]  Power on Gino.
[16022.34s -> 16023.42s]  All right.
[16023.42s -> 16025.98s]  I'm so happy that 31% of you clicked the flower
[16025.98s -> 16040.67s]  cause that's a good choice.
[16040.67s -> 16059.18s]  Let's go.
[16059.18s -> 16073.19s]  100%, you're morphing together.
[16073.19s -> 16074.31s]  This is it, this is it, this is it.
[16074.31s -> 16075.15s]  What do I do?
[16075.15s -> 16078.10s]  Okay, so you do something, that's the golden,
[16078.10s -> 16081.02s]  that's the golden, that's the golden thing.
[16081.90s -> 16082.86s]  I found it.
[16082.86s -> 16084.10s]  Now I forget what you do with this.
[16084.10s -> 16086.40s]  I think, you don't kill it.
[16086.40s -> 16087.24s]  What do you do to this?
[16087.24s -> 16103.55s]  This is the casino.
[16103.55s -> 16116.44s]  I forget what you do.
[16116.44s -> 16134.48s]  Uh oh, forget to kill these.
[16134.48s -> 16139.71s]  I think you do.
[16139.71s -> 16141.87s]  Whatever, I think you do.
[16141.87s -> 16151.95s]  And they drop something.
[16151.95s -> 16163.05s]  Hold on, I forget.
[16163.05s -> 16188.74s]  I actually am cheating right now, but that's fine.
[16188.74s -> 16190.10s]  I know, I know how you do it now.
[16190.10s -> 16193.13s]  I know how you do it.
[16193.13s -> 16194.61s]  I gotta go back to Booster's Tower.
[16194.61s -> 16195.61s]  Yeah, I remember this part.
[16195.61s -> 16198.29s]  I'm gonna, you guys are gonna laugh at me for this.
[16198.29s -> 16220.58s]  I'm gonna fuck this up a million times.
[16220.58s -> 16222.38s]  Remember, it's this one up here.
[16222.38s -> 16246.94s]  Oh, you idiot.
[16246.94s -> 16255.90s]  Hello.
[16255.90s -> 16258.50s]  Once again, nope, attack up.
[16258.50s -> 16259.50s]  They're vote kicking me.
[16259.50s -> 16260.78s]  They're vote kicking me.
[16262.94s -> 16263.78s]  What do I do?
[16263.78s -> 16265.58s]  What am I supposed to do?
[16265.58s -> 16268.62s]  I can't get kicked out of my own stream.
[16268.62s -> 16285.49s]  This is my stream.
[16285.49s -> 16291.00s]  What did that do?
[16291.00s -> 16298.13s]  Did I not get it?
[16298.13s -> 16300.70s]  All right, it is time.
[16300.70s -> 16325.37s]  Let's just attack you.
[16325.37s -> 16331.72s]  Vote kick, vote kick, vote kick.
[16331.72s -> 16334.84s]  Last time I was vote kicked from a server,
[16334.84s -> 16339.84s]  I think it was when Grandpa played CSGO jailbreak.
[16342.57s -> 16346.74s]  I think this is the last time it's ever happened.
[16346.74s -> 16350.34s]  I made everybody sing, and I didn't like how they sung.
[16350.34s -> 16355.06s]  So I just dropped everybody.
[16355.06s -> 16356.34s]  Pay attention, pay attention, everybody watch.
[16356.34s -> 16357.54s]  Look, if you're looking on a different monitor,
[16357.54s -> 16370.01s]  look right now.
[16370.01s -> 16372.49s]  War, it's a free day, free day.
[16372.49s -> 16375.41s]  I remember that.
[16375.41s -> 16385.82s]  Free day.
[16385.82s -> 16387.34s]  Nice work, guys.
[16387.34s -> 16388.66s]  I can always count on you.
[16390.54s -> 16393.99s]  I'm probably at 999 coins.
[16393.99s -> 16395.47s]  Nope, almost.
[16406.15s -> 16411.15s]  Oh, time to grow.
[16418.25s -> 16420.01s]  You know what?
[16420.01s -> 16423.54s]  What do you say we put on a table throw?
[16440.01s -> 16441.33s]  I'm so hungry.
[16441.33s -> 16444.18s]  I wish I had a carbo cookie.
[16444.18s -> 16448.13s]  I wish I had a carbo cookie.
[16448.13s -> 16450.22s]  La dee da.
[16450.22s -> 16452.78s]  It's shower time.
[16452.78s -> 16456.25s]  There there, my pretties.
[16456.25s -> 16491.62s]  Hi ho dee da.
[16491.62s -> 16496.21s]  I'm gonna take it down.
[16496.21s -> 16498.53s]  That broom made my desk vibrate.
[16505.46s -> 16507.57s]  La dee da.
[16507.57s -> 16510.07s]  It's recycled water.
[16510.07s -> 16514.06s]  There there, my pretties.
[16514.06s -> 16537.33s]  Hi ho dee da.
[16537.33s -> 16538.93s]  It's you bliss.
[16538.93s -> 16545.66s]  No, I want an able juice, and I want a geno blast.
[16545.66s -> 16549.94s]  Come on.
[16549.94s -> 16551.06s]  Oh that, you guys are like,
[16551.06s -> 16552.46s]  oh wow, I like that character.
[16552.46s -> 16553.58s]  That sounds like really creepy.
[16553.58s -> 16556.22s]  Yeah, that's what the character's supposed to be.
[16556.22s -> 16561.51s]  The fucking creepy ass motherfucker.
[16562.35s -> 16576.58s]  I'm doing my job right.
[16576.58s -> 16578.94s]  Triple.
[16578.94s -> 16579.78s]  La dee da.
[16579.78s -> 16582.90s]  Oh, I added some nutrients to this one.
[16582.90s -> 16583.74s]  Whoopsie.
[16583.74s -> 16585.67s]  Oh, there there, my pretties.
[16585.67s -> 16586.99s]  Grow up big and strong.
[16586.99s -> 16588.55s]  Hi ho dee da.
[16588.55s -> 16589.39s]  Better?
[16589.39s -> 16591.35s]  You like that better?
[16591.35s -> 16609.77s]  Okay.
[16609.77s -> 16615.60s]  That was bad Mario, come on.
[16615.60s -> 16621.26s]  I haven't been paying attention to anybody's health.
[16621.26s -> 16622.10s]  I probably should be.
[16622.10s -> 16625.26s]  Who has health?
[16625.26s -> 16627.39s]  Oh no.
[16627.39s -> 16628.39s]  First death incoming.
[16631.47s -> 16633.03s]  I have able juice, right?
[16633.03s -> 16635.82s]  Yeah, we're gonna do able juice here.
[16635.82s -> 16636.66s]  I have one more, don't I?
[16636.66s -> 16638.78s]  I do.
[16638.78s -> 16640.58s]  Okay, give this to princess Toadstool
[16640.58s -> 16642.02s]  and Toadstool has to do group hug
[16642.02s -> 16648.50s]  and then group hug and then geno.
[16648.50s -> 16650.90s]  Come on Toadstool, do something.
[16650.90s -> 16653.58s]  Don't do the Mario.
[16653.58s -> 16654.70s]  Do it to Mario.
[16654.70s -> 16658.47s]  That's fine too.
[16658.47s -> 16661.31s]  Okay, can Toadstool get a turn?
[16661.31s -> 16662.87s]  That would be nice.
[16662.87s -> 16675.12s]  Come back.
[16675.12s -> 16677.44s]  For a second I thought it didn't work.
[16677.44s -> 16692.81s]  Like is that possible?
[16692.81s -> 16694.72s]  All right.
[16694.72s -> 16698.42s]  Bring him back again.
[16698.42s -> 16706.20s]  When do I time this?
[16706.20s -> 16720.50s]  Right when at the end or when it comes out?
[16720.50s -> 16723.42s]  Am I gonna play battle for Bikini Bottom remastered?
[16723.42s -> 16725.46s]  Well, after I lose in Mario RPG
[16725.46s -> 16727.10s]  for the first time in 15 years.
[16772.98s -> 16773.90s]  Next game.
[16773.90s -> 16777.24s]  That's no, that's not how this works.
[16777.24s -> 16778.80s]  Oh, I get to do the voice again.
[16797.47s -> 16800.88s]  This is the guy that died to Piranha Plant.
[16800.88s -> 16804.03s]  Yeah, it's a tough fight.
[16804.03s -> 16809.42s]  They change it into all kinds of shrooms.
[16809.42s -> 16813.32s]  I would have Bowser here, but Bowser hurts my eyes.
[16813.32s -> 16830.66s]  So I can't have Bowser here right now.
[16830.66s -> 16832.76s]  When is Piranha Plant gonna get on Smash?
[16834.08s -> 16837.64s]  Um, did you pre-order the game?
[16837.64s -> 16838.80s]  I've got great news for you.
[16838.80s -> 16840.32s]  If you didn't pre-order the game, then I'm sorry,
[16840.32s -> 16862.18s]  but I have some pretty decent news if you did.
[16862.18s -> 16863.70s]  Give me turn.
[16863.70s -> 16867.86s]  Gino has like 40 speed right now.
[16867.86s -> 16877.80s]  I'm just fucking shocked.
[16877.80s -> 16880.12s]  You can buy the plant?
[16880.12s -> 16882.74s]  I'm not, I promise you, I did not know that.
[16882.74s -> 16884.40s]  I thought you had to pre-order that.
[16884.40s -> 16885.40s]  I didn't know you had to buy it.
[16885.40s -> 16887.16s]  I wasn't aware of that.
[16887.16s -> 16907.37s]  I stand corrected.
[16907.37s -> 16910.43s]  Lock.
[16910.43s -> 16914.66s]  No.
[16914.66s -> 16915.66s]  Oh, miss.
[16915.82s -> 16918.84s]  Oh, no.
[16918.84s -> 16921.72s]  I have to get shroom defense.
[16921.72s -> 16924.00s]  I'm gonna die again.
[16924.00s -> 16924.96s]  I have to get like shroom.
[16924.96s -> 16928.60s]  I gotta go back to town and get anti-shroom.
[16946.42s -> 16949.62s]  Somebody might live.
[16949.62s -> 16951.10s]  No, not anymore.
[16951.10s -> 16954.96s]  That's gonna be a triple kill right here.
[16954.96s -> 16955.80s]  Nope, it's not.
[16955.80s -> 16956.64s]  Somebody get out.
[16956.64s -> 16957.48s]  Somebody get out.
[16957.48s -> 16959.11s]  Somebody get out.
[16959.11s -> 16959.95s]  Somebody get out.
[16959.95s -> 16960.97s]  It's been like four turns.
[16960.97s -> 16961.81s]  He's out?
[16961.81s -> 16970.42s]  No.
[16970.42s -> 16972.02s]  Get out.
[16972.02s -> 16973.72s]  Get out.
[16973.72s -> 16976.35s]  He did it again.
[16977.19s -> 16978.47s]  All right, I'm just gonna give Peach the shroom for him.
[16978.47s -> 16980.07s]  Okay, I missed Mario, but that don't matter.
[16980.07s -> 16996.97s]  Mario's, okay, Mario, he's out, he's out, okay, okay, okay.
[16996.97s -> 16998.17s]  Good, I'm glad you did some Mario
[16998.17s -> 17008.28s]  because he's not gonna revive him.
[17008.28s -> 17010.04s]  This is important, I'm going for it.
[17010.04s -> 17021.76s]  I have to, good.
[17021.76s -> 17022.80s]  I have a chance here.
[17022.80s -> 17044.31s]  Now we do a, I'm gonna heal up Mario.
[17044.31s -> 17059.46s]  I got it unlocked now.
[17059.46s -> 17064.50s]  As long as he doesn't do the mushroom thing again.
[17064.50s -> 17079.98s]  Because then Peach can come out and do a group heal.
[17079.98s -> 17087.75s]  Hey, look at that, group hug, let's go.
[17087.75s -> 17089.55s]  All is good.
[17096.96s -> 17140.17s]  Oh, for fuck's sake.
[17140.17s -> 17151.89s]  Fuck off.
[17151.89s -> 17154.45s]  Everybody three times in a row.
[17154.45s -> 17160.18s]  Oh, come on, that is actual stupid bullshit.
[17160.18s -> 17163.75s]  Peach is gonna die.
[17163.75s -> 17166.03s]  Usually he's going for Peach every time.
[17166.03s -> 17173.90s]  Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[17173.90s -> 17178.97s]  I have to keep Peach alive.
[17178.97s -> 17180.69s]  She's all right, she's pretty much near full health.
[17180.69s -> 17185.69s]  Okay, now I'm gonna do, we're gonna do this again.
[17187.58s -> 17191.58s]  Mario's out, game over.
[17192.42s -> 17217.11s]  He can't have that much health, let's do it again.
[17217.11s -> 17219.01s]  We're going in a circle.
[17219.01s -> 17239.33s]  Okay, I've had enough, goodbye.
[17239.33s -> 17240.69s]  Oh, look what you did.
[17240.69s -> 17243.46s]  Smilax has been whacked.
[17243.46s -> 17245.18s]  Oh, I'm gonna get it.
[17245.18s -> 17248.78s]  Queen Valentina told me to keep everyone out of Nimbus land.
[17248.78s -> 17249.62s]  What should I do?
[17252.62s -> 17254.22s]  I know how to run away.
[17257.16s -> 17258.50s]  I dropped something.
[17260.52s -> 17261.78s]  What's this?
[17261.78s -> 17263.58s]  It's a seed.
[17264.94s -> 17266.58s]  Picked up a seed.
[17266.58s -> 17283.58s]  There's the seed, I found it, and boing.
[17283.58s -> 17285.38s]  And yes, you don't need to tell me.
[17285.38s -> 17291.01s]  I know where the, I know where the other insane thing is.
[17292.06s -> 17295.65s]  I know where it is.
[17295.65s -> 17299.14s]  Wow, did you see that?
[17299.14s -> 17301.98s]  It's a magical beanstalk.
[17301.98s -> 17306.18s]  Big, huge, all the way up into the sky.
[17306.18s -> 17309.66s]  It's the biggest beanstalk I've ever seen.
[17309.66s -> 17311.46s]  Hit the block once more and you'll get on it.
[17311.46s -> 17316.47s]  I promise.
[17316.47s -> 17318.43s]  Sorry, the mouse had the blue dialogue,
[17318.43s -> 17333.54s]  so I'm just kind of keeping with the cannon here.
[17333.54s -> 17336.59s]  I need, okay, I'm all right with health.
[17339.38s -> 17340.58s]  How to climb the vines.
[17340.58s -> 17341.90s]  The vines are positioned from the bottom
[17341.90s -> 17343.34s]  to the left to the top of the right.
[17343.34s -> 17345.94s]  When you jump, you will be able to disengage yourself
[17345.94s -> 17351.60s]  in the vine, Nimbus Department of Transportation.
[17351.60s -> 17356.52s]  And it goes like that, it goes, doot, doot, doot, doot.
[17356.52s -> 17361.36s]  I wanna see what that one is.
[17361.36s -> 17370.48s]  I'm curious about that one.
[17370.48s -> 17376.02s]  Really?
[17376.02s -> 17377.70s]  All right, guys, fine.
[17377.70s -> 17380.82s]  I love this area because it has the cool background.
[17394.86s -> 17397.82s]  Oh yeah, the fat Koopa.
[17397.82s -> 17403.81s]  If you let them launch, I think they kill everybody.
[17403.81s -> 17412.39s]  Oh shit.
[17412.39s -> 17416.34s]  All right, let's keep moving.
[17416.34s -> 17423.78s]  Flower tab.
[17423.78s -> 17436.12s]  Coins, I'm gonna get all these.
[17436.12s -> 17443.82s]  I was gonna say, does this thing not exist?
[17443.82s -> 17445.26s]  Ooh, caught it right at the end
[17445.26s -> 17447.02s]  and this one's on the other side.
[17447.02s -> 17458.53s]  Oh, you idiot.
[17458.53s -> 17460.82s]  How do I get this one?
[17460.82s -> 17465.82s]  Because you have to come on it from a different angle.
[17465.86s -> 17480.69s]  Can't come in from the front, can I?
[17480.69s -> 17482.17s]  Those clouds.
[17482.17s -> 17501.86s]  This is just you guys in chat right now.
[17501.86s -> 17506.27s]  I'm trying to come around the edge, but I can't grab.
[17506.27s -> 17507.11s]  Look at the shadow.
[17507.11s -> 17508.11s]  No, I know it's on this.
[17508.11s -> 17510.23s]  It's on the front, right?
[17510.23s -> 17518.12s]  Can I just, no.
[17518.12s -> 17520.32s]  Because if I can't jump and get it,
[17520.32s -> 17522.88s]  I'm on the other side and it's in front of me
[17522.88s -> 17528.71s]  and I can't get to the front.
[17528.71s -> 17536.70s]  Oh, oh my God.
[17536.70s -> 17546.58s]  This is gonna drive me fucking crazy.
[17546.58s -> 17547.42s]  Holy shit.
[17547.42s -> 17548.58s]  Okay, let's go right here.
[17548.58s -> 17602.52s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[17602.52s -> 17603.36s]  It's finicky.
[17613.42s -> 17614.26s]  I have to get them.
[17614.26s -> 17623.27s]  They're so easy, but they're not.
[17623.27s -> 17624.43s]  What plane are they on?
[17627.10s -> 17628.34s]  This forward plane right here.
[17628.34s -> 17630.54s]  Okay, got it.
[17630.54s -> 17633.98s]  Good.
[17633.98s -> 17637.25s]  Here we are.
[17637.25s -> 17648.86s]  This is a very good song, by the way.
[17648.86s -> 17650.62s]  All right, everybody, listen up.
[17667.38s -> 17668.22s]  Shut.
[17674.29s -> 17675.37s]  Shut up.
[17675.37s -> 17676.21s]  Shut up.
[17676.21s -> 17677.65s]  Shut up.
[17677.65s -> 17680.40s]  Shut up.
[17680.40s -> 17683.78s]  Shut up.
[17683.78s -> 17686.70s]  King Nimbus's condition is growing worse.
[17687.42s -> 17692.77s]  This means we'll be losing our magnificent ruler.
[17692.77s -> 17697.51s]  But it just so happens that I have found the missing prince.
[17697.51s -> 17702.44s]  Prince Melo, that is.
[17702.44s -> 17703.88s]  Prince Melo?
[17703.88s -> 17706.20s]  Please, sir, prince.
[17710.30s -> 17716.91s]  Get over here.
[17716.91s -> 17718.46s]  Well, well.
[17718.46s -> 17720.90s]  It seems that our little prince
[17720.90s -> 17723.42s]  has a mild case of stage fright.
[17723.42s -> 17724.38s]  Excuse me.
[17728.31s -> 17729.35s]  Where it's gonna happen.
[17729.35s -> 17731.46s]  I don't, wait.
[17731.46s -> 17736.89s]  Make it snappy.
[17737.69s -> 17739.66s]  You can't get through.
[17739.66s -> 17747.82s]  Just look at you, tubby.
[17747.82s -> 17752.61s]  Introducing Prince Melo.
[17752.61s -> 17755.83s]  Look at that, Prince Melo.
[17755.83s -> 17758.35s]  My, you've filled out a bit, Prince Melo.
[17760.81s -> 17766.02s]  You're looking fit, prince.
[17766.02s -> 17769.94s]  Yes, what is it, dear?
[17769.94s -> 17770.94s]  What?
[17770.94s -> 17773.33s]  You're asking me to?
[17773.33s -> 17775.02s]  Gracious.
[17775.02s -> 17776.82s]  You're serious, aren't you?
[17776.82s -> 17779.18s]  Why, I don't know what to say.
[17779.18s -> 17783.34s]  Dear me, I've made my decision.
[17783.34s -> 17785.86s]  At the request of prince, of the prince,
[17785.86s -> 17789.66s]  I agree to become his queen.
[17789.66s -> 17791.34s]  Here it comes.
[17791.34s -> 17796.88s]  Queen Valentina, oh, it just makes me shiver.
[17796.88s -> 17799.80s]  Fucking do it.
[17799.80s -> 17800.64s]  Well, that's that.
[17800.64s -> 17804.10s]  Back to your business, everyone.
[17804.10s -> 17812.94s]  Hurry it up, William.
[17812.94s -> 17814.90s]  It's been a while since we've heard him.
[17816.46s -> 17817.86s]  Can you believe it?
[17817.86s -> 17819.10s]  What a coincidence.
[17819.10s -> 17822.54s]  There's a prince with the same name as me.
[17822.54s -> 17825.54s]  Don't we have anything better to do than hang around here?
[17825.54s -> 17838.54s]  Come on, let's go and find the rest of the star pieces.
[17838.54s -> 17841.42s]  Say, you have that, I'm looking for something,
[17841.42s -> 17842.86s]  look in your eyes.
[17842.86s -> 17848.96s]  What can I do for you?
[17848.96s -> 17856.30s]  Mega glove, war fan, and cannon, sticky glove,
[17858.42s -> 17860.94s]  fuzzy shirt, fuzzy cape, fuzzy dress.
[17866.22s -> 17867.18s]  All right, this is gonna take it.
[17867.18s -> 17868.30s]  I have a lot of stuff in here.
[17868.30s -> 17870.19s]  Okay, wait.
[17870.19s -> 17873.79s]  Pearly gloves are for mega gloves.
[17876.26s -> 17879.20s]  These are kind of jokey.
[17879.20s -> 17882.53s]  War fan for princess Peach.
[17882.57s -> 17886.62s]  Hand cannon for Gino.
[17886.62s -> 17892.33s]  Sticky glove for Mello.
[17892.33s -> 17894.41s]  Now we have courage, should we just keep that on?
[17894.41s -> 17901.06s]  No, just sell it.
[17901.06s -> 17910.00s]  Fuzzy shirt, fuzzy shirt, fuzzy cape is better than...
[17912.97s -> 17916.13s]  80 versus what?
[17916.13s -> 17919.13s]  71, that's pretty bad.
[17919.13s -> 17922.49s]  I think work pants have kind of outgrown them.
[17930.82s -> 17939.39s]  I think it's not worth keeping them on because of the defense.
[17939.43s -> 17941.83s]  I also should give the ghost medal to somebody here.
[17945.47s -> 17946.39s]  What does the ghost medal do?
[17946.39s -> 17951.12s]  Raises defense while attacking, what does that even mean?
[17951.12s -> 17954.12s]  Okay, so we have, we'll keep all the accessories.
[17954.12s -> 17957.34s]  Fuzzy dress, put that on.
[17957.34s -> 17959.18s]  Sailor cape, these can all, I can sell all of this.
[17959.18s -> 17961.46s]  Ribbit stick, double punch is not good.
[17961.46s -> 17965.45s]  Hurly gloves, not as good, right?
[17965.45s -> 17966.97s]  No.
[17966.97s -> 17971.25s]  Yeah, trust this can be sold.
[17971.25s -> 17974.73s]  Trooper shell, parasol, hurly gloves,
[17974.73s -> 17977.09s]  double stick, ribbit stick.
[17977.09s -> 17980.17s]  Sailor shirt, sailor cape, not a good dress.
[17980.17s -> 17984.94s]  I'm gonna hold on to the work pants just in case.
[17984.94s -> 17986.90s]  Rest of the stuff, jump shoes,
[17986.90s -> 17989.95s]  I'm just kind of keeping them for no reason.
[17989.95s -> 17991.98s]  Okay, let's buy.
[17997.49s -> 17999.49s]  How many, I have no more mid mushrooms.
[18001.82s -> 18003.70s]  Five pick me ups.
[18003.70s -> 18005.66s]  I probably should get a couple of these.
[18008.56s -> 18009.60s]  You know what, I feel like I haven't had
[18009.60s -> 18011.64s]  a flower box in a while.
[18011.64s -> 18013.60s]  Here we go, a flower jar, finally, okay.
[18014.60s -> 18021.46s]  Hmm, get rid of this mushroom.
[18021.46s -> 18030.84s]  Use the flower box right now.
[18030.84s -> 18033.08s]  Still want these pure waters, I can sell the pure water,
[18033.08s -> 18033.92s]  what do I care?
[18045.40s -> 18046.32s]  It's worth a lot.
[18048.04s -> 18050.40s]  Rock candy is really good.
[18050.40s -> 18054.70s]  Still have the seed, I'm not getting rid of that.
[18054.70s -> 18062.11s]  This looks all right, maybe a couple more maple syrups.
[18062.11s -> 18073.81s]  Five of them, all right, I'm ready.
[18073.81s -> 18075.53s]  I used to work for King Nimbus,
[18075.53s -> 18076.89s]  but all of a sudden one day,
[18076.89s -> 18079.21s]  Valentina told me I was fired.
[18079.21s -> 18080.37s]  I just don't get it.
[18080.37s -> 18088.67s]  He needs help, he's sick.
[18088.67s -> 18090.75s]  We used to be able to walk through the castle freely,
[18090.75s -> 18094.42s]  but I guess we shouldn't disturb the king now.
[18094.42s -> 18096.81s]  Have you seen the volcano?
[18096.81s -> 18098.02s]  Not yet.
[18098.02s -> 18099.90s]  Ooh, the volcano's to the east.
[18099.90s -> 18107.64s]  Sure wish I could take a dip in the springs.
[18107.64s -> 18109.72s]  I'm watching that volcano over there, what?
[18109.72s -> 18115.94s]  Star pieces, huh, never heard of them.
[18115.94s -> 18118.06s]  Why did Prince Malo make Valentina his queen?
[18118.06s -> 18123.57s]  I guess it's because she found him.
[18123.57s -> 18125.21s]  You know about the royal bus?
[18125.21s -> 18126.81s]  What's the royal bus?
[18126.81s -> 18129.01s]  It's a regal vehicle used only by the king.
[18129.01s -> 18131.29s]  It's parked now due to the fact that he's ill.
[18137.70s -> 18147.76s]  I'm going, before we do this, I'll be right back.
[18147.76s -> 18148.80s]  Hot springs are up ahead,
[18148.80s -> 18150.24s]  but only royalty can bathe in there,
[18150.24s -> 18157.45s]  and you don't look so royal.
[18157.45s -> 18160.37s]  I wanna go give the seed to the elder guy.
[18178.02s -> 18184.10s]  I think it's over here, right?
[18184.10s -> 18185.06s]  Where is the elder?
[18185.06s -> 18185.90s]  Up here.
[18192.37s -> 18195.00s]  See this pot over here?
[18195.00s -> 18196.72s]  This is the elder of the town.
[18196.72s -> 18198.32s]  Oh, it's the gardener.
[18198.32s -> 18199.60s]  Hi, I'm the gardener.
[18199.64s -> 18201.44s]  See that huge planter?
[18201.44s -> 18203.84s]  I spent many years seeking the legendary seed
[18203.84s -> 18205.84s]  and fertilizer to fill it with,
[18205.84s -> 18206.92s]  but I've had no luck.
[18207.88s -> 18210.14s]  If only I could find them.
[18210.14s -> 18211.26s]  Oh, incredible, I can't believe it.
[18211.26s -> 18212.10s]  It's a legendary seed.
[18212.10s -> 18213.50s]  I've been reading about it in the average garden text.
[18213.50s -> 18214.34s]  These are so rare.
[18214.34s -> 18215.82s]  Can you even begin to comprehend what a huge discovery this is?
[18215.82s -> 18219.27s]  I spent my whole life.
[18219.27s -> 18222.55s]  Hey, I haven't finished yet.
[18222.55s -> 18224.11s]  Well, that's my story.
[18224.11s -> 18230.24s]  Will you give me that seed?
[18230.24s -> 18231.88s]  I finally have it.
[18231.88s -> 18240.74s]  This is extraordinary.
[18240.74s -> 18249.08s]  He has the seed, I need to bring the fertilizer.
[18249.24s -> 18250.44s]  I need to get the fertilizer.
[18250.44s -> 18252.08s]  Something special might happen.
[18252.08s -> 18257.08s]  Now, I'm going to go fight Jinx again.
[18257.92s -> 18259.88s]  Those of you who remember who Jinx is,
[18261.04s -> 18263.48s]  he's the guy back here in monster town.
[18265.52s -> 18284.39s]  We're doing a cleanup loose ends here.
[18284.39s -> 18289.65s]  I wonder if I can beat him.
[18289.65s -> 18292.05s]  I also have the temple key, which I haven't used.
[18293.69s -> 18301.91s]  All right, let me save it first.
[18301.91s -> 18302.75s]  Where is there a save point in here?
[18302.75s -> 18308.98s]  Isn't there someone in here somewhere?
[18308.98s -> 18334.02s]  I also didn't do the 30 jumps either.
[18334.02s -> 18343.58s]  Who the hell is the save point here?
[18343.58s -> 18344.42s]  I'll be fine.
[18350.16s -> 18352.32s]  Hole, hole, hole, hole, hole.
[18352.32s -> 18353.84s]  I don't remember.
[18353.84s -> 18356.40s]  You don't actually die though, if you lose to Jinx.
[18362.66s -> 18363.50s]  You want a challenge?
[18363.50s -> 18368.11s]  Let's go.
[18368.11s -> 18370.51s]  Here we go.
[18370.51s -> 18371.91s]  Let's see if I can beat him.
[18377.30s -> 18378.78s]  Ooh, I don't think so.
[18382.00s -> 18383.68s]  Quick, run away.
[18383.68s -> 18385.13s]  Run.
[18385.13s -> 18392.68s]  Just get up, just get up.
[18392.72s -> 18394.88s]  How disappointing, running during the middle of a match.
[18394.88s -> 18396.48s]  Come back when you've leveled up sufficiently
[18396.48s -> 18397.56s]  and we'll try again.
[18402.25s -> 18404.12s]  Instant death.
[18404.12s -> 18406.24s]  Mario instant death.
[18410.71s -> 18416.79s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18416.79s -> 18418.75s]  That's what happens when chat chooses levels up.
[18418.75s -> 18421.23s]  I want to go back to the temple.
[18421.23s -> 18423.23s]  I have a temple key.
[18423.23s -> 18425.47s]  I'm fairly certain I can do something in here.
[18432.93s -> 18437.06s]  I go up here, I have to get my fortune again.
[18446.94s -> 18449.94s]  Where is it?
[18449.94s -> 18451.94s]  I'm not accepting visitors, it's past my bedtime.
[18451.98s -> 18452.82s]  Okay, there we go.
[18459.62s -> 18461.57s]  There he is.
[18461.57s -> 18465.07s]  That key you have there looks pretty tasty.
[18465.07s -> 18469.84s]  You can have the key.
[18469.84s -> 18475.06s]  It's poison.
[18475.06s -> 18480.68s]  Absolute jackpot.
[18480.68s -> 18483.29s]  Royal syrup.
[18483.29s -> 18486.92s]  Max mushroom.
[18486.92s -> 18489.85s]  Fire bomb.
[18489.85s -> 18491.89s]  No, it's the worst, probably picked me up.
[18491.89s -> 18497.74s]  Or mushroom maybe, yeah.
[18500.77s -> 18508.22s]  And then one, two, three, four flower tabs.
[18508.22s -> 18512.38s]  Now, I think it's time that I try to do the casino.
[18512.38s -> 18516.18s]  We have to go back to Booster's Tower.
[18516.18s -> 18517.96s]  Wait, what am I doing?
[18517.96s -> 18518.80s]  I just leave, can't I?
[18518.80s -> 18527.62s]  No.
[18527.62s -> 18535.94s]  I just want to go in there.
[18535.94s -> 18537.58s]  Just keep and smell the cards.
[18546.36s -> 18549.88s]  I have to go win a other casino game.
[18551.24s -> 18553.72s]  A shitload of times, I think, if I remember this
[18553.72s -> 18554.80s]  from what I Googled.
[18569.22s -> 18582.05s]  Back to Booster's Tower.
[18582.05s -> 18589.88s]  All right, we have to make it back up to the top
[18589.88s -> 18594.73s]  to go to the secret casino.
[18594.77s -> 18618.05s]  And then it includes that chain chomp.
[18618.05s -> 18620.21s]  Come on, I'm telling you, I'm way higher than these guys.
[18620.21s -> 18623.26s]  I can run.
[18623.26s -> 18625.45s]  Jeremy.
[18625.45s -> 18626.29s]  Look, just get her.
[18626.29s -> 18632.13s]  Just.
[18632.13s -> 18633.25s]  Am I gonna fight the secret boss?
[18633.25s -> 18634.33s]  Yes.
[18634.33s -> 18638.25s]  I will defeat, probably first try,
[18638.25s -> 18645.66s]  the hardest secret, almost impossible boss in the game.
[18645.66s -> 18655.73s]  In fact, I probably guarantee it.
[18655.73s -> 18657.53s]  Because I'm going to have certain items
[18657.53s -> 18661.12s]  that will make me very, very strong.
[18661.12s -> 18663.85s]  There he is.
[18664.69s -> 18667.33s]  I'm really, really sorry about before.
[18667.33s -> 18669.29s]  Here, I'll make it up to ya.
[18669.29s -> 18671.12s]  Yeehaw.
[18671.12s -> 18672.68s]  Are you having fun yet?
[18672.68s -> 18674.26s]  Hee hee.
[18674.26s -> 18675.50s]  Ah, that was just practice.
[18675.50s -> 18676.58s]  This time for real.
[18676.58s -> 18680.35s]  Yep, do it.
[18680.35s -> 18682.47s]  Guess which hand the yellow ball is in.
[18682.47s -> 18689.12s]  If you can, watch carefully.
[18689.12s -> 18690.16s]  Which hand is it in?
[18691.69s -> 18699.20s]  Very good, it's a prize.
[18699.20s -> 18700.04s]  You want to play?
[18700.04s -> 18701.87s]  I do.
[18701.87s -> 18707.74s]  Which hand is the yellow ball in?
[18707.74s -> 18709.94s]  Again.
[18709.94s -> 18711.10s]  The wilt shroom.
[18711.10s -> 18715.87s]  Ooh, doesn't that, this is for the weirdo, right?
[18715.87s -> 18719.97s]  The weirdo wants one of these.
[18719.97s -> 18726.63s]  What's cheaper, pick me up or mid-mushroom?
[18726.63s -> 18729.66s]  Want to play?
[18729.66s -> 18732.98s]  There we go.
[18732.98s -> 18736.18s]  Left again.
[18736.18s -> 18738.86s]  Wilt shroom, more wilt shrooms.
[18738.86s -> 18744.13s]  I don't think I want more than one of these.
[18744.13s -> 18752.21s]  It's wilted.
[18752.21s -> 18758.82s]  Let's go.
[18758.82s -> 18764.42s]  Right, another wilt shroom.
[18769.10s -> 18773.88s]  I have to do it again.
[18773.88s -> 18777.37s]  Left hand.
[18777.37s -> 18782.48s]  Another wilted shroom.
[18782.48s -> 18783.64s]  Want to play again?
[18783.64s -> 18789.22s]  I do.
[18789.22s -> 18807.27s]  Right, rotten mush.
[18807.27s -> 18812.38s]  Right, mid-mushroom.
[18812.38s -> 18823.21s]  Hey, cool, throw it away.
[18823.21s -> 18827.46s]  Left hand.
[18827.46s -> 18828.46s]  More rotten mush.
[18828.46s -> 18831.46s]  I don't want it, because I already have one.
[18831.46s -> 18833.10s]  What's the text on this?
[18833.10s -> 18834.06s]  Ew, it's rotten.
[18838.89s -> 18841.89s]  Again, what the fuck is happening?
[18841.89s -> 18862.94s]  I have to do this.
[18862.94s -> 18864.54s]  Come on, how many more do I need to do?
[18864.54s -> 18873.81s]  Like two, three?
[18873.81s -> 18883.91s]  Left, moldy mush.
[18883.91s -> 18893.00s]  All right, right hand.
[18893.00s -> 18895.00s]  Congratulations, you deserve this.
[18895.00s -> 18899.31s]  You got a bright card.
[18899.31s -> 18902.83s]  All right, throw away, pick me up.
[18902.83s -> 18905.59s]  I'll let you get into my brother's casino.
[18905.59s -> 18919.72s]  Wherever that is.
[18919.72s -> 18927.64s]  Member's card for the casino.
[18927.64s -> 18934.42s]  Come on, let's go save it.
[18934.42s -> 18939.18s]  Now we go back to Bean Valley.
[18939.18s -> 18943.04s]  Can I do anything else up here?
[18943.04s -> 18944.64s]  Trying to remember if there's anything else to do
[18944.64s -> 18945.68s]  in the booster tower.
[18969.38s -> 18971.10s]  Oh, come on, this is still active?
[18971.10s -> 18986.16s]  Get out of here.
[18986.16s -> 18987.12s]  It's nonsense.
[18988.81s -> 18989.65s]  Oops.
[18989.65s -> 18991.25s]  Oh yeah, they have new weapons.
[18991.25s -> 19001.46s]  Let's get the big hamburger gloves.
[19001.82s -> 19005.90s]  Oh my God, I just don't want.
[19005.90s -> 19013.86s]  Just do it, I don't care.
[19013.86s -> 19032.10s]  I don't even want to do any more attacks.
[19032.10s -> 19035.85s]  Mari.
[19035.85s -> 19036.69s]  Do you want to play a casino?
[19036.69s -> 19038.25s]  Just play the new NBA game.
[19038.25s -> 19044.54s]  It has an actual slot machine for real money.
[19044.54s -> 19046.06s]  You know what, just do it.
[19049.39s -> 19063.72s]  Wait, why does an NBA game have slot machines in it?
[19063.72s -> 19075.86s]  I didn't even touch it.
[19075.86s -> 19094.19s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[19094.19s -> 19106.93s]  I want to win my next bribe and fall from the sky.
[19106.93s -> 19116.75s]  Well, that wasn't worth coming all the way up here.
[19116.75s -> 19118.99s]  How dry his mouth must be.
[19120.03s -> 19144.07s]  Pretty dry.
[19144.07s -> 19147.03s]  So let's get to the casino.
[19147.03s -> 19147.99s]  Now I have to go back to Bean Valley.
[19147.99s -> 19149.39s]  Oh my God.
[19149.39s -> 19152.91s]  I just, I can't even run away.
[19166.42s -> 19168.97s]  Oof, I like that.
[19168.97s -> 19170.41s]  That's got a good sound to it.
[19185.59s -> 19187.46s]  Okay.
[19187.46s -> 19190.74s]  Let's go back to Bean Valley.
[19190.74s -> 19200.64s]  Go in there and do the thing we need to do
[19200.64s -> 19213.70s]  go in the secret casino.
[19213.70s -> 19223.62s]  I'm excited.
[19223.62s -> 19230.78s]  Bean Valley.
[19230.78s -> 19237.14s]  Pretty good dodges right there.
[19237.14s -> 19240.26s]  It doesn't sound very excited.
[19240.26s -> 19248.31s]  Well, I can assure you, I am very excited.
[19248.31s -> 19250.03s]  Did Jerma play Mario 64?
[19250.03s -> 19252.43s]  That's all I did when I was younger.
[19252.43s -> 19258.95s]  It's the only game I played.
[19258.95s -> 19262.66s]  What about this one up here?
[19262.66s -> 19263.62s]  Let's go, dude.
[19263.62s -> 19265.10s]  Let's go.
[19265.10s -> 19274.42s]  Let's go.
[19274.42s -> 19276.18s]  Would I ever try to speed run this game?
[19276.18s -> 19284.43s]  No, I never tried to speed run any game,
[19284.43s -> 19295.62s]  let alone this one.
[19295.66s -> 19296.58s]  I told you this joke before,
[19296.58s -> 19301.97s]  I was actually gonna try to memorize the first 12,
[19301.97s -> 19304.45s]  probably five to 10 minutes, maybe 10 minutes total
[19304.45s -> 19312.64s]  of the Dark Souls one speed run.
[19312.64s -> 19314.96s]  I was gonna try and learn the first
[19314.96s -> 19319.58s]  at least few minutes of the Dark Souls one speed run
[19319.58s -> 19320.42s]  and just do it on stream
[19320.42s -> 19329.78s]  and just pretend like I was gonna actually do it.
[19329.78s -> 19336.59s]  Here we go.
[19336.59s -> 19348.09s]  Great guys casino.
[19348.09s -> 19354.57s]  It's inside of somebody's house.
[19354.57s -> 19358.00s]  It's a really, really high and plain site here, huh?
[19358.00s -> 19365.14s]  Great guy.
[19365.14s -> 19376.54s]  Please enjoy yourself.
[19376.54s -> 19378.16s]  Hello, Mario.
[19378.16s -> 19379.90s]  I run this casino.
[19379.90s -> 19383.14s]  Feel free to enjoy yourself.
[19383.14s -> 19385.10s]  Business is slow.
[19385.10s -> 19388.87s]  Hey Mario, wanna play look the other way with me?
[19388.87s -> 19390.39s]  Ready and look the other,
[19390.39s -> 19393.99s]  hit left or right on the control pad.
[19393.99s -> 19399.21s]  Wait, gotcha, I win.
[19399.21s -> 19408.08s]  What a shitty casino.
[19408.08s -> 19409.78s]  Let's do it again.
[19409.78s -> 19411.35s]  Look the other way.
[19411.35s -> 19414.29s]  Got it.
[19414.29s -> 19415.29s]  Oh, you didn't get caught.
[19415.29s -> 19417.13s]  I lost this round.
[19417.13s -> 19418.90s]  You can have this.
[19418.90s -> 19429.81s]  Multi mush and guess what we have to do.
[19429.81s -> 19437.06s]  Look the other way.
[19437.06s -> 19438.91s]  You can have this.
[19438.91s -> 19439.91s]  A mushroom.
[19439.91s -> 19446.62s]  Ooh.
[19446.62s -> 19448.93s]  I'm not gonna say he's gonna go right.
[19448.93s -> 19450.39s]  That's what he wants me to think.
[19450.39s -> 19455.99s]  Yep.
[19455.99s -> 19463.58s]  Rotten mush.
[19463.58s -> 19464.82s]  He's gone left a few times.
[19464.82s -> 19467.62s]  He's gonna go left.
[19467.62s -> 19474.58s]  Damn it.
[19474.58s -> 19479.06s]  God damn it.
[19479.06s -> 19480.90s]  Same way.
[19480.90s -> 19482.30s]  What?
[19482.30s -> 19487.64s]  You did three times to the right?
[19487.64s -> 19488.72s]  Oh my God.
[19488.72s -> 19493.67s]  He's playing me like a film.
[19501.77s -> 19508.71s]  What the fuck?
[19508.71s -> 19516.20s]  Oh my God.
[19516.20s -> 19542.50s]  This is almost statistically not possible.
[19542.50s -> 19544.92s]  I did it.
[19544.92s -> 19559.74s]  That's unfucking believable.
[19559.74s -> 19564.38s]  When do I get the item?
[19564.38s -> 19566.54s]  I know you didn't do this a bunch of times
[19566.54s -> 19568.90s]  like the other one.
[19568.90s -> 19583.67s]  Oh, why?
[19583.67s -> 19584.51s]  I win.
[19584.51s -> 19586.99s]  I have to win a hundred times?
[19586.99s -> 19596.79s]  No, I don't.
[19596.79s -> 19599.51s]  You have to win up 100 fucking times?
[19609.68s -> 19611.24s]  Welcome to the great guy casino.
[19611.24s -> 19612.36s]  Wanna play the slot machine?
[19612.36s -> 19613.20s]  Absolutely.
[19614.58s -> 19615.42s]  How do I use that?
[19615.42s -> 19616.88s]  How do I do it?
[19616.88s -> 19618.48s]  Costs 10 coins per game.
[19618.48s -> 19619.72s]  Hit it once to start the game.
[19619.72s -> 19621.88s]  Each consecutive hit will freeze one of the pictures.
[19621.88s -> 19665.82s]  Match all three and you might win a frog coin.
[19665.82s -> 19670.64s]  Mushroom, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star.
[19671.48s -> 19672.80s]  Star, star, star, star, star.
[19672.80s -> 19691.34s]  Oh, you have to jump when you see.
[19691.34s -> 19694.02s]  So now it's, there's no way I can do this one.
[19705.36s -> 19707.07s]  This is it.
[19707.07s -> 19708.71s]  It's rigged.
[19708.71s -> 19711.79s]  So I have to jump when I see the star, right?
[19711.79s -> 19715.87s]  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[19715.87s -> 19733.38s]  Oh my fucking God.
[19733.38s -> 19734.22s]  It's rigged.
[19734.22s -> 19743.10s]  See, okay.
[19743.10s -> 19750.23s]  I thought I timed that pretty well.
[19750.23s -> 19752.35s]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
[19778.61s -> 19779.45s]  I did it.
[19779.45s -> 19780.29s]  I did it.
[19781.33s -> 19791.27s]  I'll do one more.
[19791.27s -> 19792.47s]  Welcome to Blackjack.
[19792.47s -> 19795.34s]  Let's play around, let's go.
[19795.34s -> 19797.10s]  I don't know, I know how to play Blackjack.
[19797.10s -> 19799.02s]  Don't even tell me.
[19799.02s -> 19800.71s]  Two cards.
[19800.71s -> 19804.78s]  Your first two card, your first card.
[19804.78s -> 19806.61s]  What is it Mario?
[19806.61s -> 19809.65s]  You got a 10.
[19809.65s -> 19817.00s]  Okay, his second card.
[19817.00s -> 19820.52s]  Six, is he gonna get a 16?
[19820.52s -> 19823.85s]  I will draw one card.
[19823.85s -> 19827.86s]  Draw or stay.
[19827.86s -> 19831.71s]  Well, what do you have?
[19831.71s -> 19834.45s]  I can't see what the dealer has for the first,
[19834.45s -> 19838.38s]  I can't see?
[19838.42s -> 19843.82s]  What if you have, what?
[19843.82s -> 19851.76s]  I will draw a card.
[19851.76s -> 19854.22s]  I have 26.
[19854.22s -> 19855.62s]  I broke 21, you won.
[19855.62s -> 19856.82s]  Here's your frog coin.
[19857.78s -> 19863.31s]  Let's go, I'm gonna get a hundred fucking frog coins.
[19863.31s -> 19866.08s]  I have to just take his word for it.
[19866.08s -> 19878.04s]  All right, seven, two.
[19878.04s -> 19882.05s]  I would like to draw.
[19882.05s -> 19884.26s]  I got a seven.
[19884.26s -> 19886.30s]  I'll play with this hand.
[19886.30s -> 19888.23s]  Draw or stay Mario.
[19888.23s -> 19889.49s]  16 again.
[19890.49s -> 19892.73s]  Well, I don't know what he has.
[19892.73s -> 19895.42s]  How am I supposed to know?
[19895.86s -> 19900.66s]  You hit on 16 if you're showing like an eight or a nine,
[19900.66s -> 19902.34s]  seven, eight, nine, 10.
[19902.34s -> 19909.12s]  I don't know what he has.
[19909.12s -> 19910.84s]  All right, I win.
[19915.02s -> 19916.76s]  Just kidding.
[19916.76s -> 19926.93s]  I'll take a frog coin.
[19926.93s -> 19931.60s]  This is the shittiest blackjack ever.
[19931.60s -> 19933.20s]  I thought I had 15 for some dumb reason.
[19933.20s -> 19939.10s]  All right, I got a two.
[19939.10s -> 19942.21s]  I think I should, I'll draw please.
[19942.21s -> 19947.39s]  16 again, against who has any idea.
[19947.39s -> 19975.77s]  I'm gonna stay, of course you do.
[19975.81s -> 19980.20s]  17, I have to stay on 17.
[19981.32s -> 19985.22s]  I don't know what your cards are.
[19985.22s -> 19994.32s]  I don't even like this game.
[19994.32s -> 19998.86s]  Where's my frog coin back?
[19998.86s -> 20000.74s]  Stay on 17 or more?
[20000.74s -> 20001.58s]  That's true.
[20003.28s -> 20004.60s]  But if I could see his card,
[20004.60s -> 20006.48s]  if he had a 10 facing up,
[20006.48s -> 20011.27s]  then you pretty much assume you're gonna lose again.
[20011.27s -> 20019.24s]  That gives him a chance to win.
[20019.24s -> 20022.06s]  Give me another 10.
[20022.06s -> 20038.20s]  Thank you, split.
[20038.20s -> 20047.49s]  All right, am I back to positive again?
[20047.53s -> 20050.47s]  Seven.
[20050.47s -> 20056.76s]  I am at plus one.
[20056.76s -> 20058.24s]  All right, give me another card and make it a 10,
[20058.24s -> 20063.14s]  make it 21, see you later.
[20063.14s -> 20065.49s]  Three, that's great.
[20065.49s -> 20069.98s]  Fantastic.
[20069.98s -> 20077.49s]  I'll stay.
[20077.49s -> 20079.57s]  I have 24, I have plus two, here's your frog coin.
[20079.57s -> 20088.52s]  All right, plus two, right?
[20088.52s -> 20091.29s]  Where's my frog coin?
[20091.29s -> 20098.84s]  46, I was at 50 frog coins.
[20098.84s -> 20103.14s]  Oh, I can't just use it for free.
[20103.14s -> 20104.82s]  I'm actually in my plus two.
[20121.67s -> 20123.97s]  I'm good.
[20124.49s -> 20128.49s]  I want to go look at, I think I want to go,
[20128.49s -> 20131.05s]  I think I want to get the XP ring.
[20131.05s -> 20133.06s]  It's a big purchase.
[20133.06s -> 20143.18s]  Oh, also the Turovsky.
[20143.18s -> 20144.66s]  Doubles experience when equipped.
[20144.66s -> 20159.90s]  That's so, that's amazing.
[20161.10s -> 20162.22s]  Coins is not a big deal,
[20162.22s -> 20164.54s]  but I will just stomp on everything late game
[20164.54s -> 20166.46s]  and it'll just be like, let's go.
[20167.98s -> 20170.30s]  Or I cut FP in half.
[20170.30s -> 20173.22s]  Yeah, I also have to do the fireworks and get the stone.
[20176.38s -> 20180.81s]  Yeah, I also have to do the fireworks and get the stone.
[20180.81s -> 20182.17s]  I'm going for the XP boost.
[20182.17s -> 20186.51s]  It's done, it's too late.
[20186.51s -> 20187.71s]  Who's going to wear it?
[20187.71s -> 20208.94s]  Probably Toadstool.
[20208.94s -> 20213.13s]  All right, that's done.
[20213.13s -> 20215.89s]  I'm going to need to have a ton of boosted up levels
[20215.89s -> 20218.97s]  for the real final boss of the game.
[20220.92s -> 20221.84s]  I need to go get fireworks.
[20221.84s -> 20224.44s]  Now wait, fireworks gives you the stone.
[20224.44s -> 20225.52s]  Stone then is you.
[20225.52s -> 20230.24s]  Okay, so where do I get the fireworks?
[20230.24s -> 20241.70s]  I think it's from mole town, right?
[20241.70s -> 20243.02s]  Who's selling fireworks?
[20244.02s -> 20249.28s]  Oh, there's mushroom guy too.
[20249.28s -> 20251.28s]  A mystery egg, I have no idea what it does.
[20251.28s -> 20252.76s]  It sort of grows on you, huh?
[20252.76s -> 20266.94s]  It's yours for 200 coins, I'll take it.
[20266.94s -> 20268.54s]  You can't get inside Bruce's tower really easily.
[20268.54s -> 20271.54s]  You need a strong person.
[20271.54s -> 20272.38s]  What can I get?
[20272.38s -> 20277.97s]  Who's selling fireworks?
[20277.97s -> 20278.81s]  You're a hero, Mario.
[20278.81s -> 20279.65s]  If it weren't for you,
[20279.65s -> 20284.53s]  Dinah would still be inside that mountain.
[20284.53s -> 20292.67s]  Oh, I wish I had a card about cookie.
[20292.67s -> 20293.75s]  Go to my pretend store.
[20293.75s -> 20294.87s]  Would you like a shiny stone?
[20294.87s -> 20296.14s]  Yes.
[20296.14s -> 20297.30s]  I have you bring me a fireworks
[20297.30s -> 20298.82s]  as you get your shiny stone.
[20298.82s -> 20305.35s]  Who's selling fireworks?
[20305.35s -> 20308.10s]  You?
[20308.14s -> 20310.22s]  Pa fixed the roof up.
[20310.22s -> 20311.66s]  He's singing mobile blues
[20311.66s -> 20327.36s]  and putting in a hard day's work.
[20327.36s -> 20332.35s]  Who's selling fireworks?
[20332.35s -> 20333.71s]  Oh, I think it's you.
[20333.71s -> 20334.55s]  You like fireworks
[20334.55s -> 20335.95s]  and working on my very own invention right now.
[20335.95s -> 20337.51s]  I've only got the sparkles down, but I ain't giving up.
[20337.51s -> 20340.39s]  Want to buy one for 500 coins.
[20340.39s -> 20343.67s]  Well, don't think I'm going to the casino
[20343.67s -> 20345.83s]  for like fucking 30 minutes.
[20345.83s -> 20346.99s]  I can sell some shit.
[20370.32s -> 20372.34s]  I mean, that's the easiest way
[20372.34s -> 20390.78s]  to keep myself out of the casino.
[20390.78s -> 20398.42s]  I don't think I need it for anything.
[20398.42s -> 20399.82s]  I, yeah, there's still an item.
[20399.82s -> 20400.90s]  I'm not gonna beat,
[20400.94s -> 20418.51s]  I'm not going to do that a hundred times.
[20418.51s -> 20419.99s]  Damn, that's a lot of money.
[20435.54s -> 20436.82s]  I'm keeping these moldy mushrooms
[20436.82s -> 20444.35s]  for the guy, the mushroom dude.
[20444.35s -> 20445.19s]  What the hell am I gonna,
[20445.19s -> 20456.78s]  should I just sell a Carol, Carol, Cola?
[20456.78s -> 20458.02s]  I mean, it's a full recovery.
[20458.02s -> 20460.92s]  That's not a good idea.
[20460.92s -> 20465.46s]  Remember, this is just like Resident Evil 2.
[20465.46s -> 20468.42s]  I'm going to hold onto these Carol, Carol, Colas
[20468.42s -> 20469.90s]  until the credits roll.
[20469.90s -> 20483.34s]  I will never use them.
[20483.34s -> 20497.39s]  I can, I can get that money.
[20497.39s -> 20513.06s]  It's over.
[20513.06s -> 20514.14s]  $500.
[20514.14s -> 20517.28s]  Thank you.
[20517.28s -> 20519.40s]  Fireworks for the shiny stone.
[20519.40s -> 20521.28s]  And then you guys are going to get a sneak peek
[20521.28s -> 20525.30s]  for those of you who have never seen it before.
[20525.30s -> 20526.50s]  Welcome to my pretend store.
[20526.50s -> 20527.62s]  Would you like a shiny stone?
[20527.62s -> 20529.06s]  Yes.
[20529.06s -> 20530.26s]  You'll trade your fireworks?
[20530.26s -> 20531.42s]  Yes.
[20531.42s -> 20532.26s]  Thank you.
[20532.26s -> 20534.57s]  Please come again.
[20534.57s -> 20542.34s]  Shiny stone.
[20542.34s -> 20543.56s]  I got it.
[20543.56s -> 20544.60s]  Let's go see.
[20544.60s -> 20545.44s]  I'm going to save the game
[20545.44s -> 20546.60s]  so you can see what's happening here,
[20546.60s -> 20548.64s]  but you don't even need to, it's cool.
[20548.64s -> 20549.48s]  It's all cool.
[20557.42s -> 20559.72s]  Here we go.
[20559.72s -> 20562.40s]  A sneak peek preview of the hardest boss in the game.
[20563.24s -> 20574.10s]  Giving fireworks to little kids.
[20574.10s -> 20575.06s]  I didn't even think about that.
[20575.06s -> 20576.59s]  All right, here we go.
[20576.59s -> 20579.75s]  You ready?
[20579.75s -> 20581.54s]  It's been sealed.
[20581.54s -> 20584.42s]  Look, the shiny stone is reacting.
[20584.42s -> 20598.26s]  The seal has been broken.
[20598.26s -> 20600.18s]  Greetings.
[20600.18s -> 20604.42s]  I am Kuulix, dark knight of thunder.
[20605.88s -> 20607.60s]  I have crossed into this dimension
[20607.60s -> 20609.28s]  to fight for the dark mage,
[20611.30s -> 20614.18s]  but this world is uninhabitable for me and my kind.
[20615.36s -> 20621.58s]  I must return to my own world before I go though.
[20621.58s -> 20625.57s]  I would like to challenge your strongest knight.
[20625.57s -> 20629.30s]  Will you accept my challenge?
[20629.30s -> 20633.39s]  Will you enter combat against me?
[20633.39s -> 20635.39s]  Sure, what can go wrong?
[20635.39s -> 20636.23s]  Unguard.
[20640.04s -> 20642.16s]  I am matter.
[20642.16s -> 20643.72s]  I am anti-matter.
[20643.72s -> 20647.04s]  I can see your past and I can see your future.
[20647.04s -> 20652.04s]  I consume time and I will consume you.
[20681.35s -> 20686.21s]  That hurts.
[20686.21s -> 20689.46s]  Goodbye, Jano.
[20689.46s -> 20690.78s]  Mario's dead here, too.
[20690.78s -> 20692.25s]  Goodbye.
[20692.25s -> 20695.51s]  That was a one hit kill from pretty much full health.
[20695.51s -> 20698.43s]  And that peach is still alive.
[20698.43s -> 20719.66s]  No.
[20719.66s -> 20727.97s]  Dead.
[20727.97s -> 20729.77s]  I didn't beat him first try as promised.
[20729.77s -> 20732.77s]  No, no, but that's not, that wasn't a real first try.
[20734.09s -> 20737.34s]  I wanted you to see the character.
[20737.34s -> 20740.63s]  That didn't count, I wanted you to see it.
[20740.63s -> 20744.79s]  That's a sneak peek.
[20744.79s -> 20747.23s]  No, I just walked in there with no armor on
[20747.75s -> 20750.03s]  and just took my helmet off and said,
[20750.03s -> 20752.11s]  shoot a bolt of lightning at my face.
[20752.11s -> 20752.95s]  I'll be back.
[20752.95s -> 20754.15s]  I didn't even try to fight.
[20765.09s -> 20768.09s]  Cause that's not even the party I would go in with.
[20768.09s -> 20771.71s]  That is, but yes, that's the hardest boss in the game.
[20771.71s -> 20774.31s]  Even the actual true final encounter
[20774.31s -> 20775.71s]  to get the credits to roll is,
[20775.71s -> 20778.23s]  that is probably 10 times harder than that.
[20778.23s -> 20779.59s]  Like that fight right there.
[20785.26s -> 20788.07s]  Let's head back here.
[20788.07s -> 20790.15s]  So that leaves us with, let me see,
[20790.15s -> 20791.99s]  we got a Nimbus land, what do we got left?
[20791.99s -> 20793.75s]  Let me get a look at the whole map.
[20794.71s -> 20796.55s]  I think I can, how do I get out?
[20796.55s -> 20802.06s]  I don't know, get back up.
[20802.06s -> 20803.14s]  Isn't it like a L and R?
[20803.14s -> 20804.58s]  How do I get like a full view?
[20811.18s -> 20814.24s]  I don't know there's a way to do it.
[20814.24s -> 20816.72s]  Up, down, left, how do I get out of this?
[20816.72s -> 20832.30s]  I want to see what's left.
[20832.30s -> 20834.98s]  Oh, there we go.
[20834.98s -> 20839.06s]  All right, so we have, from here,
[20839.06s -> 20841.34s]  we've gone through all this.
[20841.34s -> 20844.67s]  We're currently about right here in Nimbus land.
[20844.67s -> 20846.63s]  Nimbus land, we've probably got,
[20846.63s -> 20848.31s]  we've probably got about,
[20848.31s -> 20850.35s]  yeah, like probably like another four or five hours,
[20850.35s -> 20851.19s]  I would say.
[20853.00s -> 20853.84s]  So what I'm going to do,
[20853.84s -> 20860.06s]  I think that's probably going to be it for tonight.
[20860.06s -> 20861.46s]  No, I want to clean up a couple other things,
[20861.46s -> 20869.40s]  but that's it for like game progression.
[20869.40s -> 20870.76s]  I'm going to clean up a couple of the other
[20870.76s -> 20876.80s]  small little things that I want to do.
[20876.80s -> 20878.00s]  We're about 10 p.m. Pacific,
[20878.00s -> 20879.76s]  we're getting about 1 a.m. Eastern.
[20883.02s -> 20887.06s]  Did Phylactery Lich just get 49 more subs?
[20887.06s -> 20890.77s]  You madman.
[20890.77s -> 20892.41s]  You've lost your mind.
[20892.41s -> 20896.09s]  Another 50 subs from Phylactery Lich.
[20896.09s -> 20897.09s]  Holy shit.
[20901.10s -> 20902.38s]  Thank you so much Phylactery
[20902.38s -> 20907.30s]  in your insane contributions.
[20907.30s -> 20909.66s]  This over here is the most,
[20909.66s -> 20913.46s]  probably most fun of the whole game.
[20913.46s -> 20917.30s]  There is this interesting,
[20917.30s -> 20919.90s]  there's an interesting puzzle mechanic in here,
[20919.90s -> 20923.46s]  where you pick a series of rooms and a series of doors,
[20923.46s -> 20924.86s]  and it's very, very odd,
[20924.86s -> 20928.18s]  very interesting, cool things to do.
[20928.18s -> 20934.90s]  Just this part in here is probably about an hour or two.
[20934.90s -> 20936.22s]  This is probably about two hours,
[20936.22s -> 20937.66s]  maybe like an hour and a half, two hours,
[20937.66s -> 20943.96s]  and then like probably two hours here, two and a half.
[20943.96s -> 20950.16s]  So I think I'd want to do this on another stream,
[20951.08s -> 20952.29s]  but I'm not done yet,
[20952.29s -> 20956.26s]  because I'm going to go do the Game Boy thing.
[20956.26s -> 20957.10s]  And that's all right.
[20957.10s -> 20960.18s]  And then Kool-X as well, which that might take a while.
[20960.18s -> 20970.70s]  I might die a few times depending on how I approach it.
[20970.70s -> 20973.95s]  Where's the little, where's the game kid?
[20973.95s -> 20976.19s]  Merrymore?
[20976.19s -> 20979.36s]  Rosetown, where's the little kid?
[20979.36s -> 20985.36s]  Merrymore, right?
[20985.36s -> 20993.40s]  No, it's all the way in the beginning.
[20993.40s -> 20995.08s]  And the mushroom guy, that's right.
[20995.08s -> 21007.13s]  I got to go back to mushroom guy.
[21007.13s -> 21010.03s]  Where is he? In the corner over here?
[21010.03s -> 21011.99s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21011.99s -> 21013.39s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21013.39s -> 21015.03s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21015.03s -> 21017.35s]  All right, yes, I'm done.
[21018.27s -> 21020.35s]  You want this for 500 coins.
[21023.47s -> 21025.62s]  Suit yourself.
[21025.62s -> 21038.45s]  God damn it, I need to sell more stuff.
[21038.45s -> 21047.37s]  I need 500 coins.
[21047.37s -> 21051.95s]  About to do it.
[21051.95s -> 21060.52s]  Quickest way you can get money.
[21060.52s -> 21063.40s]  Safety badge is 250, but it's really,
[21063.40s -> 21067.36s]  the ghost medal is really useful too.
[21067.36s -> 21069.72s]  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm selling the card.
[21069.72s -> 21071.65s]  It's gone.
[21071.65s -> 21072.69s]  Say goodbye to the card.
[21072.69s -> 21085.70s]  I'm not going to that casino anymore.
[21085.70s -> 21089.96s]  Ah, I can't do it.
[21089.96s -> 21093.22s]  I just need to go make some cash.
[21093.22s -> 21099.45s]  Who cares?
[21099.45s -> 21101.26s]  I'm selling.
[21101.26s -> 21103.79s]  Like, I'm not going to use these.
[21103.79s -> 21141.90s]  I'm not, I know it because I've got peach.
[21141.90s -> 21144.16s]  I'm back.
[21144.16s -> 21146.40s]  I'll take it, 500 coins.
[21146.40s -> 21147.32s]  Want me to teach you?
[21147.32s -> 21148.88s]  Yes.
[21148.88s -> 21151.08s]  High score if you hit the shells with the stars
[21151.08s -> 21155.90s]  fired from the beetle.
[21155.90s -> 21158.14s]  If you get hit, recover by firing consecutively.
[21158.14s -> 21165.97s]  Just do it.
[21166.01s -> 21169.05s]  Select game on the menu and you can play beetle mania,
[21169.05s -> 21174.48s]  but please be sure not to cheat with the turbo type controller.
[21174.48s -> 21180.08s]  I'll try.
[21180.08s -> 21190.31s]  What happened?
[21190.31s -> 21203.28s]  Why am I getting hit by it?
[21203.28s -> 21204.12s]  What's going on?
[21206.58s -> 21215.10s]  Oh, the red stars are hitting me.
[21215.10s -> 21229.05s]  You want to hit them when they're highest.
[21229.05s -> 21231.89s]  Am I actually going to do this to 5,000 points?
[21236.86s -> 21238.35s]  I should just wait.
[21238.35s -> 21241.06s]  Wait till there's a bunch on the screen.
[21241.06s -> 21247.57s]  Start a chain reaction.
[21247.57s -> 21248.77s]  I got to beat this kid's high score.
[21248.77s -> 21249.61s]  I have to.
[21260.74s -> 21267.49s]  All right, you got to get the combo.
[21267.49s -> 21270.09s]  Oh, my screen just, I guess lagged.
[21280.90s -> 21282.98s]  Holy shit, I just got so many.
[21282.98s -> 21288.57s]  How many points did I just get?
[21288.57s -> 21296.90s]  What just happened?
[21296.90s -> 21302.36s]  I think I broke the game.
[21302.36s -> 21309.31s]  I just got 146,000 points.
[21309.31s -> 21311.15s]  Can I, now can I like turn it over to the kid
[21311.15s -> 21314.19s]  and be like, I did this in 10 minutes.
[21314.19s -> 21329.57s]  You've been here for weeks, kid.
[21329.57s -> 21335.92s]  I'm going to stay in the corner.
[21335.92s -> 21345.38s]  Oh shit.
[21345.38s -> 21347.82s]  Nice.
[21347.86s -> 21352.87s]  I got to get as many on the screen as I can.
[21352.87s -> 21361.54s]  No, no, no, no.
[21361.54s -> 21375.75s]  Damn it.
[21375.75s -> 21378.23s]  Okay, how many presses does it take?
[21378.23s -> 21379.91s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[21379.91s -> 21381.15s]  Okay, seven.
[21381.15s -> 21382.27s]  Let's just test that theory.
[21382.27s -> 21384.19s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[21384.19s -> 21388.95s]  Okay.
[21388.95s -> 21396.59s]  Three, four, five, six, seven.
[21396.59s -> 21405.48s]  Why did that not work?
[21405.48s -> 21422.97s]  How did I get so many multipliers last time?
[21422.97s -> 21429.33s]  I have no idea how I did that.
[21429.33s -> 21430.49s]  I'm not sure there's an amount of things
[21430.49s -> 21432.43s]  that can be on the screen.
[21432.43s -> 21433.25s]  All right, here we go.
[21433.25s -> 21441.82s]  Let me try it again.
[21441.82s -> 21445.49s]  Last try.
[21445.49s -> 21462.63s]  I mean, I can't really beat 146,000.
[21462.63s -> 21465.31s]  More.
[21465.31s -> 21466.39s]  More.
[21466.39s -> 21476.06s]  More on the screen.
[21476.06s -> 21476.90s]  Shit.
[21492.92s -> 21496.72s]  This music's driving me crazy.
[21496.72s -> 21497.80s]  Come on.
[21497.80s -> 21499.44s]  All right, that was 12,000.
[21499.44s -> 21500.28s]  What's that?
[21501.91s -> 21502.75s]  I didn't even see that.
[21502.75s -> 21513.11s]  What's a heart do?
[21513.11s -> 21515.34s]  Oh, what?
[21515.34s -> 21516.18s]  Come on.
[21516.18s -> 21544.34s]  That wasn't anything.
[21544.34s -> 21549.69s]  String, string, string.
[21549.69s -> 21553.18s]  String.
[21553.18s -> 21557.00s]  Oh, I ran out.
[21557.00s -> 21561.34s]  Last, last, last, last one.
[21561.34s -> 21564.22s]  What the fuck?
[21564.22s -> 21565.06s]  I don't think I'll just,
[21565.06s -> 21587.08s]  the length of this time have anything to do with it.
[21587.08s -> 21590.09s]  You gotta get lucky with the chain.
[21590.09s -> 21590.93s]  We need a bunch on this.
[21590.93s -> 21595.82s]  So you need to get a shitload on the screen without firing.
[21595.82s -> 21597.78s]  More, more, more, more, more, more.
[21597.78s -> 21600.90s]  One, two.
[21600.90s -> 21601.74s]  I kinda did it.
[21601.74s -> 21612.93s]  Okay.
[21612.93s -> 21613.75s]  More.
[21613.75s -> 21615.79s]  All right, that's it.
[21615.79s -> 21627.22s]  Oh.
[21627.22s -> 21639.72s]  All right, not bad.
[21639.72s -> 21640.56s]  Why are they here?
[21640.56s -> 21648.61s]  Did they run into each other?
[21648.61s -> 21649.45s]  Close.
[21649.45s -> 21663.78s]  We're getting there.
[21663.78s -> 21664.62s]  All right, I'm starting to run out.
[21664.62s -> 21671.71s]  I'm running out of juice here.
[21671.71s -> 21676.70s]  Oh.
[21676.70s -> 21679.70s]  Come on.
[21679.70s -> 21682.45s]  No.
[21682.45s -> 21683.27s]  Come on.
[21683.27s -> 21684.11s]  67,000.
[21684.11s -> 21687.43s]  What are you gonna give me?
[21687.43s -> 21701.58s]  Oh, I'm obsessed with this.
[21701.58s -> 21703.38s]  You gotta maximize the beginning.
[21703.38s -> 21705.10s]  So it's seven presses.
[21705.10s -> 21706.42s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[21706.42s -> 21707.40s]  No, it's six.
[21710.00s -> 21712.70s]  Now it's seven.
[21712.70s -> 21715.54s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[21715.54s -> 21729.96s]  Come on.
[21729.96s -> 21731.72s]  Why is 146,000 not enough?
[21731.72s -> 21737.60s]  Cause it's not 150,000.
[21737.60s -> 21754.23s]  That's a huge problem for my brain.
[21754.23s -> 21756.33s]  No, it needs to be clean.
[21756.33s -> 21757.81s]  It needs to be clean.
[21757.81s -> 21778.32s]  This is the actual final try.
[21778.32s -> 21779.92s]  Changes based on who's in the middle of the party.
[21779.96s -> 21780.80s]  I just read that.
[21780.80s -> 21793.00s]  That's pretty damn cool.
[21793.00s -> 21805.13s]  Come on.
[21805.13s -> 21816.56s]  Good one.
[21816.56s -> 21818.88s]  What?
[21818.88s -> 21820.48s]  How did that not get anything?
[21842.74s -> 21843.58s]  Do it.
[21852.16s -> 21853.40s]  Try shooting the corners.
[21861.11s -> 21862.31s]  Oh baby.
[21862.31s -> 21872.80s]  That was fucking pretty good.
[21872.80s -> 21881.62s]  I'm running out of steam.
[21881.62s -> 21882.44s]  This is the one.
[21882.44s -> 21883.28s]  This is the one.
[21883.28s -> 21896.58s]  Give me the heart.
[21896.58s -> 21898.88s]  Oh.
[21898.88s -> 21899.72s]  No, I got it.
[21899.72s -> 21900.56s]  I get it.
[21900.56s -> 21901.38s]  I actually get it.
[21901.38s -> 21902.22s]  I get it now.
[21902.22s -> 21909.66s]  You gotta try to spread it up all the way from the corner.
[21909.66s -> 21910.50s]  Thank you.
[21910.50s -> 21918.30s]  Come on.
[21918.30s -> 21919.14s]  Dammit.
[21919.14s -> 21919.98s]  Switch the background.
[21919.98s -> 21920.82s]  Hold on.
[21920.82s -> 21928.68s]  Not yet.
[21928.68s -> 21942.40s]  Oh, it's never gonna happen again.
[21942.40s -> 21943.24s]  All right.
[21943.24s -> 21948.78s]  I need some more to fill up.
[21948.78s -> 21951.11s]  That's it.
[21951.11s -> 21952.23s]  Oh, you mother.
[21952.23s -> 21953.07s]  What?
[21974.48s -> 21976.60s]  How could you not hit something?
[21976.60s -> 21980.64s]  It's impossible.
[21980.64s -> 21984.32s]  Statistically, you gotta run into somebody.
[21984.32s -> 21985.16s]  Do it.
[21986.12s -> 21987.08s]  You assholes.
[21989.82s -> 22014.92s]  I have to start over.
[22014.92s -> 22015.76s]  All right.
[22015.76s -> 22027.46s]  I'll change the background.
[22027.46s -> 22048.20s]  Actually easier to see this.
[22048.20s -> 22049.40s]  Come on.
[22049.40s -> 22063.77s]  That was a lot.
[22063.77s -> 22065.09s]  Come on.
[22065.09s -> 22066.29s]  It's so hard to breach.
[22066.29s -> 22073.11s]  It's not fair.
[22073.11s -> 22073.95s]  Just don't shoot.
[22073.95s -> 22075.87s]  Well, it's almost impossible not to
[22075.87s -> 22079.07s]  because every button shoots
[22079.07s -> 22080.59s]  and the only way you don't die.
[22080.59s -> 22081.55s]  So when I get hit, right,
[22081.55s -> 22085.11s]  I have to tap shoot to spawn.
[22085.11s -> 22086.63s]  And every time I get hit,
[22086.63s -> 22088.11s]  I have to tap it one more time.
[22088.11s -> 22090.83s]  So one, two, three, four, five, six, right?
[22090.83s -> 22093.13s]  Don't hit it again.
[22093.13s -> 22096.53s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[22096.53s -> 22098.17s]  And eventually you kind of just can't.
[22098.17s -> 22103.32s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[22103.32s -> 22137.66s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
[22137.66s -> 22138.50s]  You've got to be.
[22141.00s -> 22168.68s]  You're gonna be kidding me.
[22168.68s -> 22170.76s]  This is so dramatic.
[22170.76s -> 22209.19s]  Is this the one?
[22209.19s -> 22210.03s]  Oh, don't.
[22255.04s -> 22257.36s]  This is more difficult than a casino.
[22257.36s -> 22278.24s]  Yes, it is.
[22278.24s -> 22294.75s]  Shit.
[22294.75s -> 22295.59s]  It's possible.
[22295.59s -> 22296.41s]  You can't dodge it.
[22296.41s -> 22313.42s]  It's impossible.
[22313.42s -> 22319.62s]  Good start.
[22319.62s -> 22339.91s]  Good start.
[22339.91s -> 22358.61s]  Just need two more big ones.
[22358.61s -> 22359.85s]  I'm pressing this shit so fast.
[22359.85s -> 22366.28s]  You have no idea.
[22366.28s -> 22371.72s]  I'm the fucking master.
[22371.72s -> 22389.56s]  Let's get to a goddamn million.
[22389.56s -> 22391.24s]  250, 250, get over there.
[22391.24s -> 22392.08s]  I can get it.
[22392.08s -> 22418.85s]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[22418.85s -> 22441.81s]  Give me the heart.
[22441.81s -> 22443.18s]  I did it.
[22443.18s -> 22445.06s]  I got you a fucking million.
[22445.06s -> 22462.36s]  I got you a million.
[22462.36s -> 22466.51s]  Two million.
[22466.51s -> 22490.63s]  My arm hurts so much.
[22490.63s -> 22491.47s]  No.
[22491.47s -> 22509.73s]  That's a two million fucking books.
[22509.73s -> 22510.57s]  Give me two million.
[22510.57s -> 22523.74s]  Give me 10 million.
[22523.74s -> 22545.68s]  Oh.
[22551.42s -> 22553.38s]  He's gone insane.
[22553.38s -> 22554.58s]  I lost my mind.
[22555.42s -> 22577.45s]  We're gonna have two million points.
[22577.45s -> 22581.40s]  It's not gonna end.
[22581.40s -> 22582.68s]  I've reached the point of like no return
[22582.68s -> 22583.64s]  where it's impossible for me to lose
[22583.64s -> 22605.56s]  and I'm gonna get like a hundred million points.
[22605.56s -> 22607.20s]  No, that's not a good strategy.
[22607.20s -> 22611.74s]  You gotta get them when they're bouncing around.
[22611.74s -> 22627.73s]  Like that.
[22627.73s -> 22631.43s]  I'm doing this in front of the high score kid.
[22631.43s -> 22632.63s]  I'm just cackling.
[22632.63s -> 22634.43s]  He got 5,000 points.
[22634.43s -> 22652.38s]  Get on my level, you little bastard.
[22652.38s -> 22653.22s]  All right, five million
[22653.22s -> 22658.07s]  and I've ripped the fucking ethernet code out of my computer.
[22658.07s -> 22669.79s]  I have to stop.
[22669.79s -> 22670.63s]  You know what I'm saying?
[22670.63s -> 22676.36s]  Like at some point you gotta just call it a day.
[22676.36s -> 22677.36s]  Holy shit.
[22678.20s -> 22679.68s]  It's 999.
[22679.68s -> 22683.37s]  It can't even go any higher.
[22683.37s -> 22685.09s]  That was max combo right there.
[22705.09s -> 22709.36s]  And I thought 5,000 was hard.
[22709.36s -> 22711.24s]  Once you get to this point,
[22711.24s -> 22712.84s]  it's just impossible to lose.
[22724.43s -> 22727.00s]  Five million, that's it.
[22727.00s -> 22730.32s]  I think five million is a number that is just perfect.
[22730.32s -> 22731.16s]  You know what I'm saying?
[22731.16s -> 22750.95s]  It's a perfect number.
[22750.95s -> 22753.40s]  Get exactly five million.
[22753.40s -> 22755.56s]  That's impossible.
[22755.56s -> 22758.92s]  Actually, it might not be.
[22758.92s -> 22760.84s]  No, that is actually possible.
[22760.84s -> 22762.24s]  I'm gonna go for it.
[22762.24s -> 22783.94s]  Good idea.
[22783.94s -> 22785.14s]  Why is it slowing down?
[22785.14s -> 22786.70s]  Am I just getting slow?
[22786.70s -> 22788.64s]  Am I getting tired?
[22788.64s -> 22797.46s]  I can't tell.
[22797.46s -> 22815.69s]  I didn't chain these over 99999.
[22815.69s -> 22816.93s]  Five million, exactly.
[22816.93s -> 22818.25s]  Five million points.
[22828.33s -> 22831.32s]  3.8 million, almost there.
[22831.32s -> 22845.43s]  This all wasn't for nothing, I promise.
[22845.43s -> 22853.81s]  Get to four, come on.
[22853.81s -> 22854.65s]  I just love that.
[22854.65s -> 22856.17s]  I like the sound that it makes.
[22857.91s -> 22867.05s]  I'm a bug to a light bulb.
[22867.05s -> 22868.73s]  All right, here we go.
[22868.73s -> 22870.80s]  I gotta be careful here.
[22870.80s -> 22873.08s]  Five, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[22881.62s -> 22882.66s]  Easy.
[22882.66s -> 22895.10s]  Don't do too good.
[22895.10s -> 22903.85s]  That's pretty damn good.
[22903.85s -> 22905.40s]  How much is one?
[22905.40s -> 22908.12s]  How much is one?
[22908.12s -> 22909.40s]  I have to start shooting them, right?
[22909.40s -> 22911.08s]  Let's see, it's like 70.
[22911.08s -> 22920.60s]  I can do it.
[22920.60s -> 22924.74s]  I almost blew it there.
[22924.74s -> 22926.14s]  Holy fuck, okay.
[22926.14s -> 22931.83s]  It's still going.
[22931.83s -> 22933.31s]  4.8, we're almost there.
[22933.31s -> 22935.71s]  It's almost time.
[22935.71s -> 22938.78s]  Okay, 4.8.
[22938.78s -> 22942.06s]  I gotta start to shoot them on my own now.
[22942.06s -> 22950.24s]  No, not yet.
[22950.24s -> 22967.97s]  Oh, shit.
[22968.13s -> 22971.04s]  Okay, I understand if you have to leave.
[22971.04s -> 22972.96s]  If you wanna leave, I get it.
[22972.96s -> 22973.80s]  I really do.
[22973.80s -> 22974.72s]  I get it.
[22974.72s -> 22976.69s]  Trust me, I do.
[22976.69s -> 22980.69s]  But I'm going for 10 million.
[22980.69s -> 22991.87s]  Keep away from my internet cord.
[22991.87s -> 22995.17s]  I wanna see if it goes to 10 million.
[22995.17s -> 22996.61s]  It might not even go to 10 million.
[22996.61s -> 23005.85s]  It might break at 999,999,000.
[23005.85s -> 23006.81s]  We're fine.
[23006.81s -> 23012.25s]  I'm gonna do it very good.
[23012.25s -> 23031.20s]  There we go, it's gonna be like six million right there.
[23031.20s -> 23032.04s]  Five and a half million.
[23032.04s -> 23034.54s]  What if I do five, five, five, five, five?
[23034.54s -> 23060.10s]  I'm gonna go five, five, five, five, five, five, five.
[23060.14s -> 23063.21s]  What the fuck happened?
[23063.21s -> 23066.74s]  I like blacked out.
[23066.74s -> 23068.42s]  Okay, I like kind of blacked out there.
[23068.42s -> 23073.33s]  I like, my brain just, I turned off.
[23073.33s -> 23075.05s]  Five, 55 million.
[23075.05s -> 23075.89s]  5.5.
[23077.27s -> 23078.27s]  All right, one more.
[23086.92s -> 23089.38s]  I'm kidding.
[23089.38s -> 23090.22s]  That's 10.
[23090.22s -> 23098.26s]  That's five and a half million, come on.
[23098.26s -> 23110.08s]  See you around, kid.
[23110.08s -> 23113.74s]  I'm gonna teach you.
[23113.74s -> 23122.75s]  Trust me, kid, I already know.
[23122.75s -> 23125.64s]  I don't get anything from doing the high score?
[23125.64s -> 23127.53s]  No, well.
[23127.53s -> 23128.85s]  Well, that's it.
[23130.49s -> 23132.29s]  You ruined his life.
[23132.29s -> 23134.04s]  No, I didn't.
[23134.04s -> 23134.88s]  There are plenty of games.
[23134.88s -> 23136.80s]  He's probably way better than me at Fortnite.
[23136.80s -> 23137.64s]  I guarantee it.
[23150.06s -> 23151.10s]  He still has the Game Boy.
[23151.10s -> 23153.32s]  Yeah, I handed it back to him.
[23153.32s -> 23156.00s]  I was like, take it, egg-o-kid.
[23156.00s -> 23157.24s]  Try to beat that.
[23157.24s -> 23159.44s]  And it's just the both handles
[23159.44s -> 23161.94s]  are just covered in greasy fingerprints.
[23161.94s -> 23164.78s]  His screen just has fingerprints all over it.
[23164.78s -> 23167.18s]  Potato chip fucking hands all over his A button.
[23168.10s -> 23169.90s]  His B button is smushed in
[23169.90s -> 23171.38s]  and you have to mirror over it
[23171.38s -> 23173.98s]  and press down hard to even have it register.
[23186.56s -> 23190.45s]  I'll see you later.
[23190.45s -> 23192.36s]  That's the end of the stream.
[23192.36s -> 23194.36s]  Well, not technically the complete end,
[23194.36s -> 23199.53s]  but the end of this portion.
[23199.53s -> 23200.57s]  I do have to take my headphone out
[23200.57s -> 23201.41s]  because that's all I can,
[23201.41s -> 23204.01s]  I can't hear any of the sounds besides that now.
[23204.13s -> 23207.13s]  Oh, next up is Terraria now.
[23207.13s -> 23210.13s]  So I'll see you guys, what's today?
[23210.13s -> 23215.50s]  I'll see you guys probably on Thursday.
[23215.50s -> 23220.09s]  Thursday, we'll go again.
[23220.09s -> 23220.93s]  End of the stream, beatbox.
[23220.93s -> 23223.89s]  I don't think I can.
[23223.89s -> 23228.94s]  Time for the Terraria.
[23228.94s -> 23230.58s]  No Jerma all week.
[23230.58s -> 23238.43s]  Hey, it's Monday.
[23238.43s -> 23246.71s]  Today's Monday and Thursday is still this week
[23246.71s -> 23249.41s]  and Friday is still this week, too.
[23249.41s -> 23251.99s]  But I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[23251.99s -> 23253.83s]  I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[23253.87s -> 23258.38s]  And Friday is still this week, too.
[23258.38s -> 23260.22s]  But I love these Mario RPG streams.
[23260.22s -> 23262.62s]  They are just fun to relax and just play a game
[23262.62s -> 23264.10s]  I know everything about.
[23264.10s -> 23271.28s]  Well, like 90% of everything.
[23271.28s -> 23272.44s]  Thanks for sticking around, guys.
[23272.44s -> 23277.46s]  We will complete Mario RPG on the next stream.
[23278.34s -> 23279.66s]  But because it's probably only gonna be
[23279.66s -> 23280.94s]  another three or four hours,
[23280.94s -> 23282.98s]  I'm gonna do something else, too.
[23282.98s -> 23284.22s]  We might open with something
[23284.22s -> 23291.27s]  or we might open with this and close with something else
[23291.27s -> 23292.35s]  because it's not gonna be more,
[23292.35s -> 23297.36s]  because this is, the game's only about 15 to 18 plus.
[23297.36s -> 23302.43s]  So it's only about three or four more hours left.
[23302.43s -> 23305.51s]  Unless, yeah, unless Kool-X is an insanely hard thing
[23305.51s -> 23311.19s]  that I can't do, which I think I should be able to.
[23311.19s -> 23312.71s]  So this is Thursday,
[23312.71s -> 23320.04s]  the same time around three to four o'clock Pacific.
[23320.04s -> 23323.48s]  We will be doing potentially two things on Thursday,
[23323.48s -> 23325.99s]  finishing this up and something else.
[23325.99s -> 23326.83s]  Thank you for joining me.
[23326.83s -> 23327.91s]  See you guys later.
[23327.91s -> 23331.37s]  Have a good next couple of days.
[23331.37s -> 23335.18s]  Let's rewind back to earlier this evening.
[23335.18s -> 23337.78s]  We had some subs and some bits and all that stuff.
[23341.05s -> 23343.13s]  Sergelbutt gave 250.
[23343.13s -> 23346.99s]  They say, please clap.
[23346.99s -> 23353.25s]  I did.
[23353.25s -> 23356.03s]  Thank you, whole of one zombie for the 250.
[23356.03s -> 23358.63s]  My team understands the German mug pitched to you
[23358.63s -> 23360.86s]  wasn't up to scratch.
[23360.86s -> 23363.92s]  Here's at It's a Bitcrap.
[23363.92s -> 23366.56s]  We pride ourselves on groundbreaking designs.
[23366.56s -> 23368.44s]  We hope this new batch suits your requirements.
[23368.44s -> 23370.36s]  Look forward to working with you.
[23370.36s -> 23390.34s]  Out of my ass.
[23390.34s -> 23391.54s]  No one would buy this.
[23392.54s -> 23397.52s]  I was like, you know, I thought about a while back.
[23397.52s -> 23403.45s]  I was gonna do the German old emote as an iPhone case,
[23403.45s -> 23418.02s]  but then I realized no one would buy it.
[23418.02s -> 23420.46s]  And I know that people will say, no, I would.
[23420.46s -> 23423.34s]  That would be so funny.
[23423.34s -> 23425.10s]  I would open up like my Teespring account.
[23425.10s -> 23427.70s]  It'd be like 11 purchases over like five weeks.
[23433.64s -> 23434.48s]  So I was like, yeah,
[23434.48s -> 23442.40s]  maybe it's not worth like the cost to do it.
[23442.40s -> 23444.52s]  I'm not sure what the top one is.
[23445.04s -> 23445.96s]  That's a wallet down there.
[23445.96s -> 23446.80s]  Those are sneakers.
[23446.80s -> 23447.64s]  But what is the top one?
[23447.64s -> 23449.71s]  Is it a t-shirt?
[23449.71s -> 23452.11s]  Just a really, really shitty t-shirt.
[23455.34s -> 23458.93s]  It's not even the right way.
[23458.93s -> 23460.29s]  That's a tie?
[23460.29s -> 23462.53s]  Oh, I thought the guy,
[23462.53s -> 23466.13s]  I thought it was an open shirt with a white t-shirt.
[23466.13s -> 23467.57s]  And that was at the bottom.
[23467.57s -> 23474.93s]  Like that gross old man's stomach fanny pack.
[23474.93s -> 23484.97s]  I was like, why that t-shirt sucks?
[23484.97s -> 23487.01s]  Thank you though for this.
[23487.01s -> 23492.35s]  I will not be using any of them.
[23492.59s -> 23493.55s]  Did I save the game?
[23493.55s -> 23494.39s]  I did, right?
[23494.39s -> 23498.42s]  Let me make sure I did.
[23498.42s -> 23504.87s]  But thank you, Whole of One Zombie, appreciate it.
[23504.87s -> 23507.84s]  And power down.
[23507.84s -> 23511.12s]  Also, thank you to SirK9 for the $5.
[23511.12s -> 23512.96s]  Hey Jerma, it's Kevin's mom again.
[23512.96s -> 23514.48s]  I don't appreciate you trying to censor me
[23514.48s -> 23516.00s]  from your audience about how you caused
[23516.00s -> 23518.08s]  serious injuries to my son.
[23518.08s -> 23519.64s]  It's gotten worse.
[23519.64s -> 23522.20s]  And now all he does is he sings and plays
[23522.20s -> 23524.64s]  and dances to the Han Solo song from Star Wars.
[23524.64s -> 23530.91s]  I hope you're happy.
[23530.91s -> 23534.86s]  Kevin, listen to your mother.
[23534.86s -> 23535.70s]  Listen to your mother, Kevin.
[23535.70s -> 23539.03s]  I know you're watching.
[23539.03s -> 23542.32s]  Listen to your mother, see?
[23542.32s -> 23544.74s]  I helped.
[23544.74s -> 23549.74s]  Thank you to Allie, Allie Titian with the $10, Allie.
[23551.20s -> 23553.87s]  $10 and 15 cents.
[23553.87s -> 23558.71s]  Thank you, appreciate it.
[23558.71s -> 23561.83s]  No message, just thousand bits.
[23561.83s -> 23564.45s]  Thank you.
[23564.45s -> 23570.14s]  Thank you Drumajor, or Drumage Door, for the $2.50.
[23571.36s -> 23572.36s]  I had a dream a couple days ago
[23572.36s -> 23573.48s]  in which I was making music
[23573.48s -> 23575.44s]  and you were commentating to it
[23575.44s -> 23579.00s]  with the LOL epic YouTuber style
[23579.00s -> 23580.96s]  that made me remember what the heck happened to that.
[23580.96s -> 23583.20s]  I'm gonna make my own music stream
[23583.20s -> 23584.84s]  as we're looking forward to it.
[23584.84s -> 23588.24s]  The carnival stream happened.
[23588.24s -> 23591.50s]  I had to pick something to focus on.
[23592.62s -> 23594.58s]  And I thought that that was more interesting to me
[23594.58s -> 23599.62s]  at the time.
[23599.62s -> 23601.65s]  What happened to your book?
[23601.65s -> 23602.97s]  You know, I've gone over what happened to my book
[23602.97s -> 23606.19s]  like probably a thousand times.
[23606.19s -> 23608.35s]  I ripped it in half, I put it in a shredder.
[23608.35s -> 23615.80s]  I wrote like 17 pages.
[23615.80s -> 23619.32s]  I copy and pasted just random parts of the book
[23619.32s -> 23625.32s]  into the chat like two years ago.
[23626.24s -> 23629.49s]  I wasn't cut out for it.
[23629.49s -> 23638.81s]  I'm not cut out for it.
[23638.81s -> 23639.65s]  I'm writing a thesis.
[23639.65s -> 23640.97s]  I'm at 130 pages.
[23640.97s -> 23642.73s]  I couldn't even get to like 16.
[23645.17s -> 23646.73s]  But I also was making,
[23646.73s -> 23649.45s]  I was trying to like do way more elaborate stuff
[23649.45s -> 23652.70s]  with Choose Your Own Adventure stuff.
[23652.70s -> 23653.90s]  Writing a Choose Your Own Adventure book,
[23653.90s -> 23658.92s]  you have to write like 15 books.
[23658.92s -> 23664.19s]  That's the amount of data that's inside of one of these.
[23664.19s -> 23665.35s]  And I got overwhelmed and I was like,
[23665.35s -> 23672.26s]  this is probably not gonna work.
[23672.26s -> 23676.92s]  I wish I could.
[23676.92s -> 23679.36s]  But that is what happened to the music stream
[23679.36s -> 23684.07s]  that got eaten both financially
[23684.07s -> 23689.07s]  and kind of mentally by the carnival stream.
[23690.70s -> 23694.78s]  All things off stream that I would be potentially working on
[23694.78s -> 23700.85s]  is carnival stream until the 22nd of September essentially.
[23700.85s -> 23705.84s]  And then I'll be kind of wanting to do something else.
[23705.84s -> 23712.54s]  But hope that answers your question.
[23712.54s -> 23716.31s]  Thank you Nukable for the $10.
[23716.31s -> 23717.83s]  Hey Jerem, long time viewer, first time donator.
[23717.83s -> 23720.03s]  I've been watching since your TF2 days.
[23720.03s -> 23729.03s]  Jerma Hart, PS, please play Metal Gear Solid 3.
[23729.03s -> 23731.16s]  That's a great game.
[23731.16s -> 23732.48s]  In fact, I would probably put it up there
[23732.48s -> 23736.23s]  with in the top two, I think.
[23736.23s -> 23740.80s]  I think that's probably one of the best ones.
[23740.80s -> 23746.37s]  May even be the best one.
[23746.37s -> 23749.64s]  But thank you Nukable for the 10 bucks.
[23749.64s -> 23753.04s]  Glad you stuck around.
[23753.04s -> 23761.37s]  But I have no immediate plans to play any Metal Gear stuff.
[23761.37s -> 23764.05s]  But thank you.
[23764.05s -> 23766.45s]  Thank you Blue Crew for the $5.
[23766.45s -> 23768.33s]  Hi Jerma, I just turned 22 today.
[23769.17s -> 23771.41s]  Happy birthday, first of all.
[23771.41s -> 23772.69s]  And I want to share the celebration
[23772.69s -> 23774.69s]  with one of my favorite people on the internet.
[23774.69s -> 23777.21s]  Been watching since your grandpa Call of Duty videos
[23777.21s -> 23779.45s]  and you've helped me through some tough times.
[23779.45s -> 23781.01s]  Was wondering if you'd be interested in streaming
[23781.01s -> 23783.37s]  one of my favorite games, Lisa.
[23783.37s -> 23785.53s]  Cool Earthbound inspired indie game.
[23785.53s -> 23787.01s]  Anyways, thanks for everything, man.
[23787.01s -> 23791.00s]  Thank you for the $5.
[23791.00s -> 23793.08s]  I have actually touched upon Lisa before.
[23793.08s -> 23795.48s]  I have said I'm not going to play it on stream.
[23797.15s -> 23799.71s]  Unfortunately, I will not be playing Lisa on stream.
[23809.32s -> 23810.84s]  Play Celeste.
[23810.84s -> 23811.68s]  I did play Celeste.
[23811.68s -> 23814.00s]  I beat Celeste on stream.
[23814.00s -> 23814.84s]  That wasn't that long ago.
[23814.84s -> 23818.97s]  That was only like, what, four or five months ago?
[23818.97s -> 23820.29s]  I've done that.
[23820.29s -> 23824.60s]  It was fun.
[23824.60s -> 23825.96s]  It was a really good game.
[23829.51s -> 23832.79s]  But happy birthday.
[23832.79s -> 23834.68s]  Happy 22nd birthday.
[23834.68s -> 23835.92s]  Have a good one.
[23835.92s -> 23836.88s]  Eat cake if you like it.
[23836.88s -> 23840.92s]  If you don't like cake, substitute that for ice cream.
[23840.92s -> 23842.85s]  That's what I do.
[23843.69s -> 23844.53s]  Who wants cake?
[23844.53s -> 23845.37s]  We got cake here.
[23845.37s -> 23847.57s]  And I'm like, can I, can I just ice cream?
[23847.57s -> 23850.41s]  And you get that fucking squinting stare.
[23850.41s -> 23851.41s]  Like, really?
[23853.36s -> 23855.32s]  No, that's okay.
[23855.32s -> 23862.86s]  Thank you.
[23862.86s -> 23863.70s]  Thank you though.
[23863.70s -> 23870.80s]  Happy birthday.
[23870.80s -> 23873.50s]  Thank you Apple shit for the 250.
[23873.50s -> 23875.18s]  Hey man, do you listen to Taylor Swift?
[23875.18s -> 23876.54s]  She's my fave.
[23876.54s -> 23878.10s]  And she just put out a new album.
[23878.10s -> 23879.90s]  So I've got to ask, have a great day.
[23884.00s -> 23887.80s]  Let me try to come up with one song from Taylor Swift
[23887.80s -> 23892.46s]  that I could reliably say is Taylor Swift's song.
[23892.46s -> 23893.30s]  Let me try it.
[23893.30s -> 23896.88s]  Hold on.
[23897.72s -> 23901.06s]  She wears sneaker.
[23901.06s -> 23903.58s]  I wear sneakers.
[23903.58s -> 23905.46s]  I'm in the bleachers.
[23907.00s -> 23908.20s]  Right?
[23908.20s -> 23913.82s]  Is that one?
[23913.82s -> 23919.20s]  That's Taylor Swift, right?
[23919.20s -> 23921.20s]  I don't know the name of that song.
[23921.20s -> 23927.20s]  All I know is that that is Taylor Swift singing that song.
[23927.20s -> 23934.91s]  And you, and you, and you belong with me.
[23935.11s -> 23937.10s]  Eee.
[23937.10s -> 23938.38s]  I had to just decide if I was going to be able
[23938.38s -> 23954.24s]  to hit her or not and I could.
[23954.24s -> 23956.52s]  I don't, I'm glad you like Taylor Swift.
[23956.52s -> 23960.49s]  That's the only song I've ever heard on the radio.
[23960.49s -> 23961.45s]  I don't even listen to the radio.
[23961.45s -> 23963.53s]  Guys, I silently sit in the car.
[23963.53s -> 23966.48s]  Does anybody else do that?
[23966.48s -> 23967.96s]  I don't listen to music or anything.
[23967.96s -> 23971.04s]  I just sit there quietly in the car and just drive.
[23976.96s -> 23981.20s]  Does that make me a psycho?
[23981.20s -> 23986.64s]  But I need to be, no, I can't.
[23986.64s -> 23988.92s]  It's the sounds of the road and the tires
[23988.92s -> 23998.34s]  and the vibrating of the dashboard and stuff.
[23998.34s -> 24001.86s]  Guys, I make my own and I talk to myself in the car.
[24001.86s -> 24003.86s]  How would I ever be able to play music
[24003.86s -> 24006.42s]  when I'm having incredibly detailed conversations
[24006.42s -> 24021.32s]  out loud with myself?
[24021.32s -> 24022.48s]  He's Patrick Bateman.
[24022.48s -> 24026.23s]  No, no, people, everybody does that.
[24026.23s -> 24028.91s]  You even pull up at a red light and you look over
[24028.91s -> 24031.23s]  at the car next to you and this,
[24031.23s -> 24033.91s]  and somebody is just talking away.
[24033.91s -> 24036.47s]  Just their mouth is moving up and down and all kinds of,
[24036.47s -> 24038.23s]  they're like really distinctively,
[24038.23s -> 24040.31s]  and there's nobody in the car.
[24040.31s -> 24041.55s]  And then you understand there's no music,
[24041.55s -> 24044.67s]  so they're not lip syncing or singing along with anything.
[24044.67s -> 24048.05s]  And they don't, there's no call.
[24048.05s -> 24048.89s]  They're not on the phone.
[24048.89s -> 24053.46s]  No, they're not.
[24053.46s -> 24055.02s]  They're not on a cell phone.
[24055.02s -> 24055.86s]  No, they're not.
[24055.86s -> 24056.70s]  They're looking straight,
[24056.70s -> 24058.38s]  they don't have their hands are both on the wheel.
[24058.38s -> 24061.95s]  No, no audio coming out of that car.
[24061.95s -> 24077.31s]  No hands-free phone.
[24077.31s -> 24084.00s]  Why are you staring at this person?
[24084.20s -> 24092.92s]  It's free phone calls.
[24092.92s -> 24093.76s]  Well, good.
[24093.76s -> 24094.96s]  I'm glad you all think that.
[24094.96s -> 24097.44s]  I'm glad that's all what you guys have in your brain
[24097.44s -> 24099.04s]  whenever you see anybody doing that.
[24099.04s -> 24101.28s]  Because when you pull up next to me,
[24101.28s -> 24102.84s]  I'm not on the phone,
[24103.68s -> 24105.60s]  but that means everybody thinks I am.
[24105.60s -> 24106.68s]  So that's good.
[24106.68s -> 24107.50s]  I'm glad.
[24107.50s -> 24109.04s]  That makes me really happy in knowing that people
[24109.04s -> 24110.96s]  will just be like, oh, that guy's on the telephone.
[24110.96s -> 24132.92s]  No, I'm not.
[24132.92s -> 24134.40s]  You don't do it while walking down the street.
[24134.40s -> 24136.04s]  No, because the car,
[24136.04s -> 24141.50s]  an automobile is a completely enclosed space.
[24141.50s -> 24143.02s]  It's like, it's almost like your own,
[24143.02s -> 24144.54s]  it's like being in the bathroom.
[24144.54s -> 24147.26s]  It's like your own personal little bathroom space.
[24147.26s -> 24148.10s]  Nobody's there.
[24148.10s -> 24149.86s]  If you're, if it's nobody in there,
[24149.86s -> 24152.78s]  you can, you can talk, you can just relax.
[24152.78s -> 24155.06s]  You drive, you obviously pay attention to the road,
[24155.06s -> 24158.62s]  but it's like your own little space.
[24158.62s -> 24163.30s]  You're enclosed.
[24163.30s -> 24175.28s]  No, you don't go to the bathroom in your car.
[24175.28s -> 24178.68s]  It's the only place where you can truly scream.
[24178.68s -> 24180.56s]  This person gets it.
[24180.60s -> 24183.54s]  You get it.
[24183.54s -> 24190.24s]  In the car is the only place where you can scream.
[24190.24s -> 24195.33s]  You can be like, woohoo!
[24195.33s -> 24196.29s]  And it's just, it's fine.
[24196.29s -> 24198.04s]  It's just you.
[24198.04s -> 24213.00s]  If I do that here, I'm gonna wake somebody up.
[24213.00s -> 24214.20s]  Just do that on your Twitch streams.
[24214.20s -> 24215.64s]  You do that in the bathroom.
[24219.45s -> 24225.37s]  No, I don't do that in the bathroom.
[24225.37s -> 24227.61s]  The car is the safest place to make weird noises.
[24227.61s -> 24229.51s]  Yeah, you can just be in the car and be like,
[24229.51s -> 24233.65s]  boop, boop, boop, boop, ooo, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[24233.65s -> 24236.09s]  Ain't anybody ever gonna fucking know you did that.
[24236.09s -> 24236.97s]  I just did that right now.
[24236.97s -> 24242.96s]  I bet you Kim heard what I just did.
[24242.96s -> 24244.44s]  She's, I mean, after the stream's over,
[24244.44s -> 24245.28s]  she's probably gonna come up and be like,
[24245.28s -> 24247.84s]  why'd you make those weird noises?
[24247.84s -> 24268.51s]  And I'm gonna be like, god, wish I was in my fucking car.
[24268.51s -> 24276.10s]  What kind of car does Jeremy Albertson drive?
[24276.10s -> 24276.94s]  We already went over this.
[24276.94s -> 24281.19s]  You guys are gonna have to guess.
[24281.19s -> 24284.07s]  You'll never get it.
[24284.07s -> 24289.77s]  It's so cool.
[24289.77s -> 24292.57s]  No, it's not a 2009.
[24292.57s -> 24293.57s]  Yeah, it is.
[24293.57s -> 24296.12s]  Did I talk about this already?
[24296.12s -> 24296.96s]  Did you guys already get it?
[24296.96s -> 24297.78s]  Did I already?
[24297.78s -> 24299.52s]  Oh, yeah, you guys already got it, nevermind.
[24299.52s -> 24305.04s]  The mystery is solved.
[24305.04s -> 24307.71s]  Nevermind.
[24307.71s -> 24310.79s]  But, enough of that, we'll move on.
[24310.79s -> 24313.66s]  Thank you to Gnarly for the 250.
[24313.66s -> 24315.14s]  Today I learned that some of the voices
[24315.14s -> 24316.96s]  from Undertale characters are sampled sound clips
[24316.96s -> 24317.86s]  from other media.
[24319.91s -> 24322.43s]  Flowey's voices are from Ronald McDonald
[24322.43s -> 24330.48s]  and Sans is Patrick from Sponged Bob.
[24330.48s -> 24335.40s]  Hold on, wait, Flowey's voice is Ronald McDonald?
[24335.40s -> 24349.08s]  What clip of Ronald McDonald sounds like that?
[24349.08s -> 24349.92s]  That's insane.
[24357.48s -> 24359.04s]  Flowey.
[24359.88s -> 24361.63s]  That game was really fun.
[24361.63s -> 24363.83s]  That game was really just interesting to play.
[24371.40s -> 24374.48s]  Hold on, I wanna listen to this.
[24374.48s -> 24375.88s]  Sans voice is sample of Patrick going,
[24375.88s -> 24377.72s]  maybe it's the way you're dressed,
[24377.72s -> 24379.68s]  but the A part is trimmed out and looped.
[24382.09s -> 24391.67s]  Oh shit, huh?
[24391.67s -> 24408.50s]  The way you're dressed, maybe it, maybe, maybe, maybe.
[24408.50s -> 24418.95s]  Wow, interesting, that's cool.
[24418.95s -> 24420.51s]  That's, yeah, that's cool.
[24420.51s -> 24421.95s]  Did they have the Flowey one?
[24421.95s -> 24434.16s]  What's the Ronald McDonald one?
[24434.16s -> 24439.51s]  If anyone's got that one, I'm interested in that one too.
[24439.51s -> 24444.01s]  This one.
[24444.05s -> 24450.34s]  If this is a gnome, this stream's a gnome.
[24450.34s -> 24451.18s]  Just make sure where I go,
[24451.18s -> 24453.10s]  so you're, maybe you're aware of that.
[24464.57s -> 24466.45s]  So you guys really, really, really
[24466.45s -> 24468.69s]  are having a good time here.
[24468.69s -> 24471.41s]  There's a Rick Roll link and there's a gnome link.
[24477.00s -> 24479.36s]  Thanks, thanks to this person that saved the stream.
[24479.36s -> 24496.78s]  I'm here.
[24496.78s -> 24503.91s]  It packs the right, let's see.
[24503.91s -> 24523.74s]  And try shake.
[24523.74s -> 24527.58s]  What in the name of, what the fuck?
[24527.58s -> 24528.62s]  Make good use of that.
[24528.62s -> 24529.94s]  Ah, here they are.
[24530.02s -> 24534.50s]  Triple thick McDonald shakes.
[24534.50s -> 24535.62s]  Well, they're empty.
[24538.85s -> 24542.05s]  You sure can get a lot in these bags, can't you?
[24544.05s -> 24545.81s]  You always make good use of that.
[24545.81s -> 24546.81s]  Ah, here they are.
[24547.77s -> 24556.27s]  Oh.
[24556.27s -> 24559.34s]  Damn.
[24560.90s -> 24561.74s]  Oh.
[24564.50s -> 24568.08s]  I did that last stream.
[24568.08s -> 24571.73s]  It's pretty weird.
[24571.73s -> 24574.13s]  But thank you to Gunther.
[24574.13s -> 24575.73s]  Thank you Gunther Riddle for the 250.
[24575.73s -> 24578.05s]  What is Yardovich's favorite flavor of gum?
[24580.06s -> 24582.94s]  Blueberry, I don't know.
[24582.94s -> 24586.90s]  Thank you though.
[24586.90s -> 24591.18s]  Thank you Gnarly for the 250.
[24591.18s -> 24593.74s]  These RPG streams are fun.
[24593.74s -> 24594.74s]  Hope you do more in the future.
[24594.74s -> 24596.34s]  Preferably Bowser's Inside Story.
[24596.34s -> 24598.22s]  But I think we're driven,
[24598.22s -> 24600.74s]  we've driven that point home already.
[24603.20s -> 24609.23s]  I guess that is the one that everybody likes the most, huh?
[24609.23s -> 24612.42s]  But thank you Gnarly.
[24612.42s -> 24615.22s]  I thank you Gunther for the 250
[24615.22s -> 24617.82s]  and it's the second part of the
[24617.82s -> 24622.03s]  what is Yardovich's favorite flavor of gum?
[24622.19s -> 24625.07s]  And the answer is Spear?
[24625.07s -> 24626.79s]  Spearmint?
[24626.79s -> 24627.63s]  Spearmint.
[24630.53s -> 24633.84s]  Because of the spear?
[24633.84s -> 24634.84s]  That's pretty good.
[24650.78s -> 24655.26s]  Thank you BitSlave for the five dollars.
[24655.26s -> 24656.66s]  Hey Jeremy, a few streams ago I told you about
[24656.66s -> 24658.70s]  how I was stuck in the base, in this base.
[24658.70s -> 24660.02s]  You said you hoped I got orders soon
[24660.02s -> 24664.35s]  and the very next day I was given orders
[24664.35s -> 24666.91s]  to out process.
[24666.91s -> 24669.03s]  I'll be attending Survival Evasion,
[24669.03s -> 24676.81s]  Resistance, and Escape training.
[24676.81s -> 24678.69s]  Well, I'm glad you got actual orders
[24678.69s -> 24680.41s]  but you were talking about that.
[24680.41s -> 24687.98s]  So I wonder how intensive that is.
[24687.98s -> 24689.46s]  Survival Evasion, Resistance, Escape.
[24689.46s -> 24693.35s]  Well, good luck with it, whatever it is.
[24693.35s -> 24694.19s]  And then they say,
[24694.19s -> 24696.35s]  by the way, will you please play League of Legends?
[24696.35s -> 24702.31s]  No.
[24702.31s -> 24704.75s]  Somebody could knock on this back door here
[24704.75s -> 24707.43s]  with like a briefcase full of like 50 grand in it.
[24708.35s -> 24712.06s]  And all I had to do was play League of Legends
[24712.06s -> 24714.30s]  and understand the whole game
[24714.30s -> 24717.60s]  and understand all the champions
[24717.64s -> 24721.60s]  and play at a level that I was at least competent
[24721.60s -> 24724.69s]  in knowing how to do everything.
[24724.69s -> 24727.42s]  I would slowly close the door
[24727.42s -> 24729.18s]  and come back and sit up.
[24729.18s -> 24731.18s]  I wouldn't do it.
[24731.18s -> 24732.94s]  That would take me, you know,
[24732.94s -> 24734.90s]  if I had to put in like a hundred hours
[24734.90s -> 24738.04s]  to like know everything about every champion,
[24738.04s -> 24739.40s]  I wouldn't do it.
[24739.40s -> 24741.36s]  I wouldn't do that for fucking 50 grand.
[24751.86s -> 24754.66s]  That sounds like, that sounds really, really,
[24754.66s -> 24756.50s]  really like entitled.
[24757.26s -> 24765.92s]  I wouldn't play a game for 50 grand.
[24765.92s -> 24768.20s]  I have no interest at all.
[24768.20s -> 24769.72s]  But I don't know, here's another thing though.
[24769.72s -> 24773.22s]  I have no interest in like farming either.
[24773.22s -> 24774.06s]  If somebody was like,
[24774.06s -> 24775.14s]  hey, I'll give you 50 grand
[24775.14s -> 24778.66s]  if you'd learn how to plant all these carrots
[24778.66s -> 24780.46s]  and corn and shit and like learn to milk cows
[24780.46s -> 24781.30s]  and run my farm.
[24781.30s -> 24783.18s]  I'm gonna be like, dude, I don't wanna do that.
[24783.18s -> 24784.02s]  I don't even know, I don't know,
[24784.02s -> 24792.07s]  where am I gonna start?
[24792.07s -> 24796.07s]  It would take as long to learn
[24796.07s -> 24798.55s]  every recommended perfect meta build
[24798.55s -> 24800.19s]  for every champion.
[24800.19s -> 24801.07s]  It would take the same amount of time
[24801.07s -> 24809.62s]  to learn how to run a farm.
[24809.62s -> 24810.46s]  That would be, that would be,
[24810.46s -> 24811.74s]  I could probably learn how to run a farm
[24811.74s -> 24819.30s]  in three to 500 hours.
[24819.30s -> 24821.46s]  I could probably learn how to,
[24821.46s -> 24825.06s]  I could, you know, think about like class.
[24825.06s -> 24827.58s]  If somebody would teach me how to plant every crop,
[24827.58s -> 24829.10s]  it would probably be about 500 hours
[24829.10s -> 24834.54s]  of me knowing how to do it.
[24834.54s -> 24835.74s]  Would I be any good at it?
[24835.74s -> 24839.70s]  No, still takes an extensive amount of knowledge
[24839.70s -> 24845.34s]  and skill to be able to run a farm.
[24845.34s -> 24852.06s]  It takes, you know, become an outdoor IRL farmer.
[24852.06s -> 24855.62s]  I don't think I'm good.
[24855.62s -> 24864.11s]  Every crop.
[24864.11s -> 24865.87s]  Farming is way more useful.
[24865.87s -> 24867.07s]  You know what, now that I think about it,
[24867.07s -> 24868.79s]  I would take that,
[24868.79s -> 24870.83s]  I would take 50 grand to go be a farmer
[24870.83s -> 24875.66s]  because that's, yeah, that is incredibly useful.
[24875.66s -> 24877.74s]  I would tell the guy trying to offer me 50 grand
[24877.74s -> 24878.56s]  to play League of Legends,
[24878.56s -> 24879.90s]  I'd be like, can you just go make a farm?
[24879.90s -> 24883.11s]  Pay somebody to make a farm.
[24883.11s -> 24896.35s]  Go grow some almonds somewhere.
[24896.35s -> 24898.27s]  What is the cutoff for the magazine submissions?
[24898.27s -> 24899.99s]  And okay, so let me, I gotta go over this.
[24899.99s -> 24903.17s]  This is very, actually really important.
[24903.17s -> 24908.37s]  There is no cutoff yet.
[24908.37s -> 24911.25s]  There is no cutoff for those submissions at the moment
[24911.25s -> 24913.45s]  because I need to place that somewhere.
[24913.45s -> 24916.21s]  So there is not a cutoff yet that's not tomorrow.
[24917.94s -> 24919.08s]  Because remember I told you last week
[24919.08s -> 24920.04s]  that I was gonna have to move it again
[24920.04s -> 24922.06s]  because of all this other stuff.
[24922.06s -> 24926.85s]  So that is not accurate.
[24926.85s -> 24930.97s]  We're just gonna keep those submissions open for now
[24930.97s -> 24939.00s]  until I can get a real date.
[24939.04s -> 24941.04s]  Somebody said, wait, when is this?
[24941.04s -> 24943.28s]  We don't have a date yet.
[24943.28s -> 24944.60s]  It was going to be,
[24944.60s -> 24947.08s]  the submissions deadline is gonna be tomorrow,
[24947.08s -> 24949.28s]  but it's just gonna be open for a little bit.
[24949.28s -> 24950.90s]  So take your time.
[24950.90s -> 24952.92s]  It's not gonna be closing on like tomorrow
[24952.92s -> 24954.60s]  or the next day or something.
[24954.60s -> 24956.56s]  This, it'll probably end up closing at some point
[24956.56s -> 24958.68s]  like next week and we'll do it like the week after.
[24958.68s -> 24962.35s]  It's gonna happen before the carnival stream,
[24962.35s -> 24967.08s]  but I kind of haven't been able to focus on it.
[24967.08s -> 24967.92s]  What am I talking about?
[24967.92s -> 24970.94s]  I'm talking about the activity book stream.
[24970.94s -> 24971.90s]  In the discord right now,
[24971.90s -> 24976.04s]  there are a series of channels under activity book,
[24976.04s -> 24981.04s]  dot to dot, where's Waldo, brain teasers, jokes and the like.
[24985.56s -> 24988.92s]  What you can do is you can go there
[24988.92s -> 24993.92s]  and submit a community themed image
[24994.88s -> 24998.49s]  in one of those categories.
[24998.49s -> 25006.92s]  I'm gonna compile a bunch of them to have about,
[25007.88s -> 25011.28s]  five to 10, maybe 10 plus dot to dots,
[25011.28s -> 25013.28s]  where's Waldo images and we're going to do
[25013.28s -> 25015.96s]  a community themed activity book on stream.
[25015.96s -> 25017.26s]  I'm gonna do it on stream.
[25018.20s -> 25020.28s]  There'll be coloring book pages
[25020.28s -> 25021.12s]  that are gonna be in there.
[25021.12s -> 25027.96s]  It's just gonna be a neat little thing that we're gonna do.
[25027.96s -> 25030.76s]  How am I gonna be picking the ones to use on the stream?
[25030.76s -> 25034.87s]  We are going to just kind of pick by our discretion.
[25034.87s -> 25037.63s]  So we're gonna try to find the ones that are,
[25037.67s -> 25041.07s]  obviously they could, let's say we do 10 to 20 dot to dots
[25041.07s -> 25044.19s]  or like 10 to 20, where's Waldo images
[25044.19s -> 25045.51s]  and where's Waldo by the way, if you don't know,
[25045.51s -> 25049.19s]  it's where you have an incredibly detailed potential image
[25049.19s -> 25051.79s]  where you have to hide me in it and I have to find it.
[25056.99s -> 25058.71s]  So that's still up in the air.
[25058.71s -> 25060.67s]  Just if you're working on something for it,
[25060.67s -> 25062.39s]  if you wanna have something for it,
[25062.39s -> 25065.43s]  I will have a real actual hard day here soon.
[25065.43s -> 25071.75s]  I just have not been able to put any real time into it.
[25071.75s -> 25076.04s]  He does scream in the car.
[25076.88s -> 25078.08s]  Yeah, like this one time we were going out
[25078.08s -> 25081.39s]  and I was so excited.
[25081.39s -> 25083.23s]  We got to a red light and I waited for the summer
[25083.23s -> 25085.03s]  to pull up next to me and I was like,
[25085.03s -> 25094.24s]  Yabba Dabba Doo, he's screaming in the bathroom.
[25095.61s -> 25098.25s]  I do not scream in the bathroom, okay?
[25102.10s -> 25110.90s]  Unless it's a Yabba Dabba Doo scenario.
[25110.90s -> 25115.08s]  Anyway, we're gonna move on.
[25115.08s -> 25120.53s]  Thank you to BBBBBBB Bird for the five dollars.
[25120.53s -> 25122.29s]  Hey German, much love from Australia.
[25122.33s -> 25124.49s]  Unfortunately, the Sans voice is,
[25127.35s -> 25130.68s]  right, thanks for the five dollars, appreciate it.
[25134.29s -> 25140.98s]  Yabba Dabba Doo scenario equals pee pants moment.
[25140.98s -> 25151.29s]  Lots of pee pants moments.
[25151.29s -> 25152.33s]  You've been live for seven hours.
[25152.33s -> 25154.77s]  You should have consumed six gallons of water by now.
[25154.77s -> 25155.61s]  Did you do it?
[25166.44s -> 25170.05s]  Hey, Demons V, thanks for the three bucks.
[25170.05s -> 25172.41s]  I like Mario RPG out of two.
[25172.41s -> 25174.41s]  I think they're very, very good games.
[25174.41s -> 25187.15s]  This one is a very good game, singular.
[25187.15s -> 25189.03s]  Just don't drink it from the Berkey.
[25191.49s -> 25193.97s]  That device is actually pretty good.
[25193.97s -> 25196.93s]  I really don't want to have to say this again.
[25196.93s -> 25201.37s]  It's not bad.
[25201.37s -> 25203.93s]  This next one is Noodle is bad at gaming for three dollars.
[25203.93s -> 25204.77s]  Thank you, Noodle.
[25204.77s -> 25206.05s]  And they say, I made a funny meme.
[25206.05s -> 25207.97s]  What do you mean you made a funny meme, what's that?
[25218.00s -> 25221.32s]  It's a me as Sans, do you eat ass?
[25233.86s -> 25236.10s]  It's a second long, just click it.
[25260.23s -> 25262.79s]  Show us how it would look if we saw you screaming in the car.
[25262.79s -> 25264.75s]  No, I'm not doing it.
[25273.04s -> 25274.68s]  Smelly boy, thanks to the 250.
[25274.68s -> 25276.68s]  Here, here, just the first minute,
[25276.68s -> 25277.64s]  you don't have to play this whole,
[25277.64s -> 25279.36s]  you don't have to play this on stream.
[25279.36s -> 25280.84s]  This is the best Trump impression I've ever heard.
[25280.84s -> 25286.93s]  I really can't stand your Stephen Colbert Trump.
[25286.93s -> 25289.27s]  My Trump is not Stephen Colbert Trump.
[25289.27s -> 25290.47s]  His boy better than that.
[25297.35s -> 25298.95s]  Trying to make some middle of the tiny.
[25298.95s -> 25300.99s]  He says, he says, hey, it's me, Donald.
[25300.99s -> 25308.71s]  I'm just trying to listen and let me tell you something.
[25308.71s -> 25313.45s]  I was, I was trying to find.
[25313.45s -> 25314.33s]  That, that's the same.
[25314.69s -> 25320.36s]  I heard the same thing.
[25320.36s -> 25321.52s]  In fact, I said it at the same time
[25321.52s -> 25330.81s]  and it was in both of my ears and I heard the same voice.
[25330.81s -> 25338.44s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[25338.44s -> 25339.60s]  Hey, been loving Mario RPG,
[25339.60s -> 25341.28s]  you should play more comfy games like this.
[25341.28s -> 25351.56s]  I probably will.
[25351.56s -> 25356.48s]  No, Stephen Colbert, Stephen Colbert Trump is like this.
[25356.48s -> 25359.15s]  He goes like this.
[25359.15s -> 25364.15s]  It's me, Stephen Colbert doing the Stephen Colbert Trump.
[25365.07s -> 25373.23s]  I'm sorry, mine's a lot more nuanced than that.
[25373.23s -> 25376.03s]  My Trump is a little like this.
[25376.03s -> 25381.23s]  He said, I, hey, hold on.
[25381.23s -> 25384.33s]  Don't, I don't put my hands in the air
[25384.33s -> 25387.77s]  and wave them around like this.
[25387.77s -> 25389.09s]  Well, you can't see.
[25394.74s -> 25397.42s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25397.42s -> 25421.12s]  Hold on, we're gonna put this to rest right now.
[25421.12s -> 25421.96s]  Oh, that's a good Trump.
[25421.96s -> 25424.90s]  That's a good Trump.
[25424.90s -> 25428.83s]  And his eyes are rolling back in his head.
[25428.83s -> 25430.93s]  What is it?
[25430.93s -> 25432.37s]  That's a good Trump.
[25432.37s -> 25434.40s]  That's not Trump.
[25434.40s -> 25440.90s]  Hold on.
[25440.90s -> 25448.09s]  If you think that's even close to what I did.
[25448.09s -> 25454.05s]  Get to the part with the rapping and the music.
[25454.05s -> 25455.81s]  Get to the part with the rap.
[25455.81s -> 25458.93s]  Get to the part with the rapping and the music, okay?
[25458.93s -> 25462.36s]  I don't have time to do this.
[25462.36s -> 25465.75s]  I can't believe this thing won a Tony.
[25465.75s -> 25467.35s]  I can't believe this thing won a Tony.
[25467.35s -> 25469.83s]  No, I can't believe this thing won a Tony.
[25469.83s -> 25483.74s]  That's unbelievable, not even close.
[25483.74s -> 25486.58s]  Your Stephen Colbert doing a Trump impression
[25486.58s -> 25489.46s]  is better than the actual impression.
[25499.14s -> 25500.94s]  No, it's not.
[25500.94s -> 25501.78s]  No way.
[25506.93s -> 25508.73s]  My fucking ego.
[25508.73s -> 25511.33s]  Shit, that was 20 damage.
[25511.33s -> 25523.25s]  It's all right.
[25523.25s -> 25528.98s]  God damn it.
[25528.98s -> 25530.94s]  Let me tell you, believe me.
[25535.41s -> 25537.41s]  Hey, I never claimed to be an impressionist.
[25537.41s -> 25539.17s]  I just claimed to be incredibly gifted
[25539.17s -> 25541.71s]  at doing other people's voices.
[25541.71s -> 25553.09s]  Oh, fuck.
[25553.09s -> 25554.05s]  Have I seen the tongs?
[25554.05s -> 25554.89s]  I don't know what the tongs are.
[25554.89s -> 25555.93s]  That's a good question.
[25555.93s -> 25560.43s]  I will come down and help you look in a minute.
[25560.59s -> 25563.03s]  If I liked your lich also gave an insane amount of subs,
[25563.03s -> 25565.76s]  let's go ahead and put them on screen.
[25565.76s -> 25570.98s]  Cause I mean, it was 49 gifted subs.
[25570.98s -> 25572.02s]  They're gonna fly by.
[25572.02s -> 25573.50s]  Here they are.
[25573.50s -> 25584.17s]  Thank you everybody for the subs.
[25584.17s -> 25588.05s]  Thanks for new subs, old subs, community subs.
[25588.05s -> 25591.49s]  If you stuck with this channel for the last four years
[25591.49s -> 25594.77s]  or if you just found the channel literally last night.
[25594.77s -> 25600.25s]  Thank you.
[25600.25s -> 25602.64s]  Have a great next couple of days.
[25602.64s -> 25609.96s]  See you guys on Thursday.
[25609.96s -> 25612.95s]  We have two more bits to go through.
[25612.95s -> 25613.79s]  Much love to all of you.
[25613.79s -> 25616.72s]  Thank you.
[25616.72s -> 25619.89s]  Gondor Lane, thanks for the 250.
[25619.89s -> 25621.85s]  Have you heard of Limbo of the Lost?
[25621.85s -> 25623.29s]  It's a really horrible point and click
[25623.29s -> 25627.05s]  that's infamous for using stolen assets from a dozen games.
[25627.05s -> 25629.29s]  Yet it has its charm of being so bad, it's good.
[25629.29s -> 25632.88s]  It's free to download because it's also been abandoned,
[25632.88s -> 25634.72s]  but it still has the reputation of the worst point
[25634.72s -> 25636.68s]  and click game that has ever existed.
[25636.68s -> 25638.40s]  Please play it.
[25638.40s -> 25639.96s]  You'll do us all a good favor.
[25645.32s -> 25647.31s]  Maybe.
[25647.31s -> 25649.31s]  I do wanna do another FMV night
[25649.31s -> 25651.35s]  because there's at least a handful of FMV games
[25651.35s -> 25658.00s]  that I have not played that I would like to play.
[25658.00s -> 25660.92s]  So you will absolutely see me play a bunch of FMV games,
[25660.92s -> 25668.61s]  although I don't know if that's also an FMV game.
[25668.61s -> 25674.32s]  I do wanna play Ripper.
[25674.32s -> 25677.80s]  That should be fun.
[25677.80s -> 25683.16s]  Also at the very end, thank you to Flugboy for the $5.
[25683.16s -> 25684.00s]  Hey, hope you're doing well.
[25684.00s -> 25687.91s]  Jeremy was waiting to ask you, wanted to ask you something.
[25687.91s -> 25690.07s]  Now I know you like newer shit like the Gorillaz,
[25690.07s -> 25691.55s]  but you like any old school music
[25691.55s -> 25693.91s]  like The Beatles, Deep Purple Prince, et cetera.
[25702.16s -> 25705.14s]  Yeah, I do.
[25705.14s -> 25710.80s]  But I kinda just, I don't have any Beatles albums,
[25710.80s -> 25713.04s]  but if The Beatles are on the radio,
[25713.04s -> 25718.04s]  when I'm not fucking talking and doing a monologue in the car,
[25718.60s -> 25721.36s]  if The Beatles are on somewhere, I'll point up and go,
[25721.36s -> 25724.20s]  oh, The Beatles are on here.
[25724.20s -> 25730.63s]  Guys, I get most of my music media consumption
[25730.63s -> 25733.73s]  from the inside of a grocery store
[25734.91s -> 25738.00s]  or whatever is playing in the mall.
[25738.00s -> 25739.88s]  And if you're walking around
[25739.88s -> 25741.64s]  and you're buying some jeans at Old Navy
[25741.64s -> 25748.39s]  and you hear like fucking Prince on the radio,
[25748.83s -> 25752.43s]  you look up and you go, oh, all right, Prince, nice.
[25753.97s -> 25758.99s]  And then I go back to buying jeans.
[25758.99s -> 25760.91s]  But I mean, I like music,
[25760.91s -> 25772.49s]  I just don't really listen to a lot of music.
[25772.49s -> 25775.77s]  Jeremy is confirmed an NPC.
[25775.77s -> 25778.69s]  I'm not an, what do you mean NPC?
[25778.73s -> 25786.82s]  I'm a playable character, all right?
[25786.82s -> 25790.34s]  What do you mean, what does that mean, true?
[25790.34s -> 25792.80s]  True, he's an NPC.
[25792.80s -> 25794.28s]  Why, because I walk around the mall
[25794.28s -> 25796.92s]  and go into Old Navy and buy jeans
[25796.92s -> 25799.48s]  because I don't listen to The Beatles?
[25799.48s -> 25803.92s]  That makes me like a non-playable character?
[25803.92s -> 25804.92s]  Guess what, guys?
[25804.92s -> 25808.92s]  When I play GTA, I turn the damn radio off.
[25808.92s -> 25812.48s]  I'm driving around as like Franklin in that car
[25812.48s -> 25815.80s]  or as Jared, what's his name?
[25815.80s -> 25829.77s]  The other guy, Michael, and I turn it off.
[25829.77s -> 25831.43s]  What's his name?
[25831.43s -> 25843.88s]  Trevor, Trevor, did I say Jared?
[25843.88s -> 25845.28s]  And that might be because I don't wanna get
[25845.28s -> 25847.60s]  my channel copyright striked,
[25847.60s -> 25849.56s]  but it's also because I'm the playable character
[25849.56s -> 25863.71s]  and I don't wanna hear it.
[25863.71s -> 25866.79s]  But no, I do not really listen to that much music.
[25866.79s -> 25868.43s]  I listen to it when it's available,
[25868.43s -> 25873.48s]  but I don't listen to it kind of on purpose.
[25873.48s -> 25876.20s]  I'll be like in a club or a bar,
[25876.92s -> 25878.60s]  that's the lie, this doesn't happen.
[25878.60s -> 25883.90s]  It only happens when for some, I don't go to clubs.
[25883.90s -> 25889.49s]  But if I was there, I would hear the music in the club.
[25889.49s -> 25891.05s]  I can't even tell, I don't even remember
[25891.05s -> 25894.56s]  the last time I walked into a club.
[25894.56s -> 25898.84s]  It has to have been when I was like, I don't know, like 22?
[25898.84s -> 25900.92s]  I have not walked inside of a club
[25900.92s -> 25904.00s]  in probably 10 fucking years.
[25904.00s -> 25908.53s]  I don't even know what they play in clubs anymore.
[25908.53s -> 25911.95s]  The guy with the marshmallow head, right?
[25911.99s -> 25915.20s]  And they play Fortnite music.
[25915.20s -> 25927.97s]  That's what I heard.
[25927.97s -> 25929.17s]  All right, I'm leaving.
[25932.95s -> 25934.63s]  I'm actually seething.
[25934.63s -> 25938.13s]  I'm kidding, it's a joke.
[25938.13s -> 25940.01s]  I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[25940.01s -> 25942.29s]  Bye, good night, goodbye.
[25942.29s -> 25943.85s]  See you Thursday.
[25943.85s -> 25944.85s]  Take care of yourselves.
[25944.85s -> 25945.85s]  Have a good night.
