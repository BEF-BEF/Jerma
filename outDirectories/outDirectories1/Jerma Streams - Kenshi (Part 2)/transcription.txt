[1.53s -> 7.72s]  Why hello. Good afternoon, good evening, everybody. Good morning for some of you, probably.
[12.46s -> 29.42s]  I am Jeremy. Jeremy D. Elbertson. The D is for Daniel. We are going to play Kenshi again,
[30.70s -> 40.04s]  but a few things have come up that need to be addressed, that are very important, and just
[40.04s -> 47.13s]  came up with the idea two or three hours ago. So it's going to take a little bit of planning,
[47.13s -> 53.05s]  it's going to take some time on my part and on yours. You guys aren't doing nobody's in trouble.
[53.05s -> 64.44s]  What? Why does everybody think they're in trouble? No, it's about New Year's Eve. So before, well,
[64.44s -> 69.88s]  well, you know, hold on, just give me a second. Let me just open my soda off camera, because I
[69.88s -> 77.16s]  don't want to blow out everybody's ears. So let's just open that up right. All right, got it open.
[79.86s -> 84.18s]  Put it in your sippy cup. No, this is, I can drink out of a soda. A soda is a giant sippy cup.
[84.66s -> 89.24s]  Well, I mean, it's a regular size sippy cup, but it's just a, it's a sippy cup already.
[90.14s -> 96.95s]  It has one small hole to enter and exit. It's not a giant empty void at the top of a cup.
[100.42s -> 106.87s]  Anywho, I'm going to wait till people get here, because this is the last second thing that I want
[106.87s -> 112.38s]  to do for New Year's Eve. Long story short, before we really get into the meat there,
[113.80s -> 117.80s]  I have the studio for New Year's Eve. I'm going to do a New Year's Eve award show,
[118.97s -> 126.42s]  based on the worst moments of the last 12 months. So you guys are going to be nominating,
[126.42s -> 132.55s]  and I'm talking very quickly. Not yet, though. Not yet. We'll go over it. I'm going over this
[132.55s -> 136.63s]  in real time, because this shit just came up, like, like I said, a couple hours ago.
[139.00s -> 145.08s]  So there will be categories to nominate some of the worst moments of the year. We're talking
[145.08s -> 154.22s]  worst joke, worst overall stream, worst hair on stream, worst noise, best use of cardboard.
[154.22s -> 164.98s]  You know, there's got to be a couple best of categories. Worst gaming stream, like we're
[164.98s -> 170.44s]  talking, I want to get all of them. There'll be probably 10 or so, maybe 15 categories.
[171.00s -> 175.82s]  And we're going to do an award ceremony on New Year's Eve to count down the New Year.
[179.45s -> 190.87s]  Why not make all best? Because that's, we already talked about this last night.
[190.87s -> 196.04s]  Have best streamer, and I'm not even on the list now. But how this is going to work
[196.92s -> 207.88s]  is that the channel is currently locked. I'm eight hours behind you for midnight. It's 8am.
[207.88s -> 213.08s]  Well, it's not that I could do about that. I'm not I'm not Atlas. I can't like spin. And I'm
[213.08s -> 216.68s]  not talking about the video game. I'm talking about like the guy that holds the earth.
[220.23s -> 225.19s]  So let's just wait for people to get here. I got the game set up already. We're going to play
[225.19s -> 231.83s]  Kenshi again. We got the frog friends. But we're really only going to have you're going to have
[231.83s -> 235.83s]  one day to nominate stuff, because we're going to I'm going to give you all the categories here.
[235.83s -> 241.35s]  We're going to write them out on stream a little bit later. Then you're going to have a day or so
[241.35s -> 246.63s]  to nominate in a discord channel that's separate. Same thing that's going to happen like happen with
[246.63s -> 254.10s]  the Christmas stream. Oh, and then I'm kind of torn on how the voting is going to work,
[254.10s -> 256.90s]  because you're probably I'm not going to stream for the next two days to get this already.
[258.44s -> 265.45s]  So the voting is probably going to be for one day only. You got to make sure you get your vote in.
[265.45s -> 277.42s]  But regardless, we will once we get about halfway through here. It's a Coca Cola classic is what
[277.42s -> 289.98s]  it is. Hey, look, it's Kenshi. This is exactly where we left off last night. Can you wait four
[289.98s -> 301.82s]  hours so I can watch the VOD? No, just just put it on times 10 speed, and then add subtitles. I
[301.82s -> 308.65s]  haven't forgotten on me, but I just stopped it last night. So let's get in here. I haven't paused
[308.65s -> 318.46s]  if you missed the last stream. We ended up with these three thick up top thick on the bottom.
[319.78s -> 330.34s]  And the dog that is no longer starving to death just a little malnourished. So not bad. I still
[330.34s -> 339.66s]  have 1600 bucks. I don't have food. I have some decent food here. Name the squad. Oh, yeah, the
[339.74s -> 351.26s]  frog. How do I name them? Can you name the squad? Oh, yeah, that forgot that they look like they
[351.26s -> 359.32s]  could survive in a crash. What was that guy? That weird guy that crash test dummy thing.
[359.32s -> 378.18s]  But anywho, here they are. So the last thing that we were doing, click on SQD. Oh, here we go. So
[378.18s -> 394.78s]  let's go with does everybody have to be like a little frog? Right now they're just frog and dog.
[394.78s -> 407.91s]  Well, frogs, frogs and dogs. I'll get another dog. Three out of 20. Great Canadian just came
[407.91s -> 417.64s]  with 10 community subs right off the bat right now. Thank you so much. 10 community subscriptions.
[420.15s -> 426.71s]  Nice. I haven't even pressed unpause yet. But anyway, so we're working together. I did a little
[426.71s -> 435.34s]  bit of research. I read some things about athleticism. Athletics is just run speed.
[435.98s -> 440.07s]  So that's doesn't mean anything else. I don't think I looked up some stuff about attack,
[440.07s -> 445.30s]  defense, strength, how to strength train and all that stuff. So I know a little bit more.
[445.30s -> 458.23s]  So I need to go into a building that has a training dummies. And I'm not sure where they are here.
[458.79s -> 465.53s]  I gotta get out of here. No, but hey, hold on a second. My mind's running a mile a minute right
[465.53s -> 471.29s]  now because this whole New Year's Eve thing is has to happen real quick. And I got to put a
[471.29s -> 477.37s]  lot of time into it over the next couple of days. So I will explain the title in full detail. We're
[477.37s -> 482.17s]  going to go over that soon. This stream, I'm sorry, this stream is not going to be like
[482.81s -> 486.17s]  eight plus hours. Like I thought it was going to be, it's going to be cut short to lake.
[486.17s -> 492.81s]  I don't know, maybe four or five because I have to do a bunch of work and we got to get the
[492.81s -> 496.89s]  nominations in because I got the studio. It's confirmed. I'm in studio on New Year's Eve.
[496.89s -> 506.73s]  I got the confirmation already. So right now my brain is like, well, what about those categories?
[508.70s -> 512.46s]  And no, we're not into the stream. I'm going to go for like a good four hours and then we'll talk.
[512.46s -> 522.33s]  Okay. So let's go train. Jeremy, you forgot about something. Oh, are you sure about that?
[523.05s -> 543.02s]  I don't think I did. You think I forgot about this? All right, let's go train. We need to find,
[543.58s -> 551.40s]  what do we need to find here? I got to find training dummies in this town and it said look
[551.40s -> 557.16s]  for a dome. Look for the dome building. Every major town has one and has training facilities
[557.16s -> 567.37s]  upstairs. I mean, this is a dome building, right? Just go in here. Facecam as a bonus character.
[570.82s -> 577.69s]  What city am I in right now? I'm currently in, this is world's end, I believe.
[578.57s -> 588.01s]  Nope, this is blister hill. Pump up the base. You sure you want me to do that? Put on the facecam.
[588.65s -> 593.30s]  But what if I don't want to? Where is this camera anyways? I don't even know.
[598.17s -> 603.50s]  Here, I'll turn it up. Here, I'll give you a little boost of audio. Where do you want the cam?
[603.50s -> 609.75s]  I don't want to put the cam on. Where should I put it? Where even is it? I got clothes on, right?
[613.69s -> 617.37s]  It's in like a weird, it's too like far that way. You know what I mean? You're just, you're getting
[617.37s -> 625.48s]  like the side profile. What kind of like, what kind of facecam is this? I'm like clearly looking
[625.48s -> 630.41s]  just straight ahead. Don't need to be like in the gamer zone where like I'm, you can tell I'm looking
[630.41s -> 645.00s]  at the game. I feel like I should be on the front of a gorilla's album. No, it's going off. Let's go
[645.00s -> 657.91s]  train. Uh, up one floor. Are there training dummies in here? No, they're not training dummies in there.
[660.89s -> 663.85s]  Training dummies. Looking for training dummies. I saw them before, didn't I?
[664.98s -> 676.25s]  Fuck. What do they look like? I thought they were training dummies. Fuck. Training dummy? No.
[677.05s -> 694.41s]  I need to do this before I leave. Just buy a house and put a dummy in it. Does this town not have a
[694.41s -> 707.74s]  training dummy? I thought we saw before. Just hit people instead. No, I can't. Fuck. They look like
[707.74s -> 714.23s]  stick people. Yeah, like from like base or barracks or something maybe.
[715.03s -> 732.71s]  Not gonna let me look in here. I don't know. Outside the walls. Are there some outside the walls?
[733.27s -> 748.98s]  Are you sure about that? Outside walls. You see any? I gotta find them. I can't really leave.
[749.78s -> 762.82s]  Outside walls. Outside walls. Fuck. Check the garage. I would think that maybe down here.
[766.06s -> 772.95s]  Right there, dude. It's right there, dude. Where? I'm getting a lot of right there, dude. And I'm
[772.95s -> 781.19s]  like, where is that? Did I build this? Yes. This is my first city. Spent about two days making it.
[782.55s -> 786.39s]  That building. That building. That building. This building. Like this building.
[787.50s -> 803.16s]  Right there, dude. This is public. No, the other one. Not there. Bars aren't for... Yeah, this is a
[803.16s -> 814.34s]  bar. From my understanding, they look like they're like on top. Maybe this is not training dummies
[814.34s -> 822.15s]  in this town or something. Click on the map. I mean, wouldn't it? Should be here, right?
[827.08s -> 836.94s]  In the second gate, the building to the right is the barracks. Oh, yeah. All right. So,
[837.50s -> 846.33s]  am I allowed in here? This is open to the public. Let's go. I'm allowed to come up here.
[850.49s -> 861.34s]  We are allowed up there. Where are they? How far away is this place? Oh, there we go.
[861.90s -> 866.76s]  All right. So, we got... We have these training dummies. I'm allowed to use these, right?
[867.56s -> 874.52s]  So, let's go with Kandroth. We're going to train. Let's take a look. Start training.
[875.85s -> 880.33s]  There we go. And you, you are... How are you? Are you already trained high enough? I think you can
[880.33s -> 891.59s]  only train a certain level on these. Maybe not. Maybe I should give him the weapon. Can I not train
[891.59s -> 899.43s]  the dog? No, the dog's just constantly hungry. Back away from there. What? Are they talking to us?
[900.07s -> 915.53s]  That's private equipment. What? Why? Can I get one point before I leave? God damn it.
[915.53s -> 920.68s]  Come on. One point. One point and I'll leave. Stay away from there. That's private equipment.
[920.68s -> 924.38s]  One point. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[925.02s -> 940.06s]  You just need one last little bit. Come on. Okay. Okay. How did I go down? I went down and
[940.06s -> 954.17s]  attacked. Somehow. Doesn't that make no sense? Wait a minute. Hold on. What? Combat. Melee attack
[954.17s -> 963.51s]  two. See? Okay. I got, I did it. So, what did he, what is he at now? He's six? Okay. So, this is the
[963.51s -> 972.30s]  guy that needs that good weapon. Yeah. Well, that's not a bad weapon, but still. So, I need to open
[972.30s -> 979.13s]  up both of their inventories here. So, you need to put this away and I just go like this. How do I
[979.13s -> 986.47s]  have both open at the same time? Trade. Okay. So, you need this weapon because you are way better.
[987.66s -> 990.94s]  Let's trade. Because the other one is actually going to be doing damage. Let's see.
[992.14s -> 997.66s]  Five plus nine. What was it before? Six. Was it, was it more on the other one? Because he had.
[1000.07s -> 1010.28s]  So, that's nine defense now. So, what's the problem? You can't use this? Too heavy for you?
[1011.45s -> 1017.27s]  Ten. Attack point is minus two because I can't even use the damn thing. All right. Well,
[1017.27s -> 1030.17s]  whatever. He's got ten attack. Well, I illegally up, leveled up my two carriages once. All right.
[1030.17s -> 1041.06s]  So, let's all go meet up and let's go try to make some money. I forgot how good this viral soundtrack
[1041.06s -> 1048.15s]  was. Are you coming, dog? Let's go. All right. Where are we going to go? I got, let's buy some
[1048.15s -> 1052.23s]  food. Let's get a good supply of actual food. I'm going to save it and we're going to go on an
[1052.23s -> 1067.46s]  adventure. Let's set up a bar. It's the closest bar. Over here, probably. Right here. Yeah. Yeah.
[1067.46s -> 1091.13s]  Yeah. A little, a little band of weirdos. I love it. All right. Let's get in this way. Holding alt
[1091.13s -> 1097.91s]  highlight. Yeah. Wait. Right on the ground. All right. We need to trade. Let me see what you got.
[1098.71s -> 1103.34s]  What you've got. This is expensive. You don't have any more little meat sticks, do you?
[1104.60s -> 1107.80s]  It might be worth buying a few of these because they're very, uh, nutritious.
[1109.19s -> 1127.22s]  I mean, like, carry them both at the same time. Carry them both at the same time. So, I can afford
[1128.39s -> 1139.40s]  three, three, six, nine, twelve. I can afford to buy all three of these. Or no, actually, I can,
[1139.40s -> 1150.84s]  I can afford two, but they're very nutritious. And that's it. I got 200 bucks. I got the backpack
[1150.84s -> 1159.37s]  already full of food. Now, as long as one person has, uh, has stuff, they can, like, for instance,
[1159.37s -> 1167.10s]  I have a bunch of stuff in my backpack. This is, this will feed everybody, right? I got a backpack
[1167.10s -> 1180.07s]  full of food. So, we're good. Time for, let's go. I'm ready to move. I don't, no, the dog's good.
[1180.07s -> 1189.27s]  We're good. The three of us are ready to go. We have weapons. We have a giant sack and it's time
[1189.27s -> 1197.19s]  to go. So, we're gonna go from here this time. I'm gonna go, we're gonna go down river and we're
[1197.19s -> 1202.33s]  gonna end up at some point over here. I don't know where this is gonna bring us, but we're gonna go.
[1204.41s -> 1212.20s]  Increase the music. Um, no, we're good. The music's fine where it is. I don't want it to overpower.
[1213.43s -> 1228.39s]  Here we go. See you later, suckers. Humble beginnings, guys. Eventually, they all have
[1228.39s -> 1240.28s]  30 people in a city. Are these bandits or? No, Holy Nation, that's fine. All right. What a perfect
[1240.28s -> 1251.69s]  RPG party. Following right behind each other. This is just my voice. We're gonna get a mining
[1251.69s -> 1262.26s]  stream out of this? Uh, it's possible. That all depends on, uh, on a few factors. Everybody's
[1262.26s -> 1271.08s]  doing good with food. Except, why is it, uh, no, no one's eating. Okay. All right, slow it down.
[1271.08s -> 1279.32s]  Slow it down. Food. Now's our chance. Run them through. Wait a second. Hungry bandit leader.
[1279.88s -> 1285.22s]  Hungry bandit. Starving bandits. What do they have for, their attack is not that good.
[1286.33s -> 1297.56s]  Four, five, turn around. Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around. Go, go, go. This way.
[1297.56s -> 1311.75s]  Same, same way we came. Come on, bring them to the gate. They're cutting us off. I didn't save it. I
[1311.75s -> 1314.87s]  didn't save it. I didn't save it. I didn't save it. I didn't save it. We're not fast enough.
[1314.87s -> 1325.43s]  I didn't save it. Where's the gate? Where? Come on. I need right here. Make it to right here.
[1326.31s -> 1343.27s]  Just run into the fucking town. We can make it. It's going to be fine. Go. Come on. 26 fucking
[1343.27s -> 1361.61s]  damage. Really? Come on, dog. Why am I so much faster? The dog's gonna get left behind. I just
[1361.61s -> 1377.82s]  fed him. Come on, hurry. Get to the gate. All right. Bring it in. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1377.82s -> 1383.37s]  Fight the, fight the bandits. Just bring them in the town. Bring them to the storm and guards
[1383.37s -> 1403.74s]  quickly. What the fuck is happening? All right. Let them fight. All right. We're good. This is
[1403.74s -> 1416.15s]  loot. Everybody's body. Perfect. Oh, you got a little bit of armor. I'll take it. Pants better.
[1416.15s -> 1425.37s]  Not really. Thanks for the free stuff, guards. Armor. Who doesn't have armor right now? We don't.
[1427.61s -> 1442.98s]  Pants. What happened to my pants? A little weapon stick. What happened to the portrait? All right.
[1442.98s -> 1450.73s]  That's good. We got a little bit of armor out of that. You're under arrest. How are we doing? Okay.
[1452.68s -> 1459.70s]  Head. Dog is fine. Stomach. Right arm. I don't need to manage anything. We're fine. I don't think
[1459.70s -> 1467.02s]  it's necessary. Actually, right arm. Right arm going down. I'm going to need to heal that.
[1467.74s -> 1483.59s]  I don't have a med kit. Well, I do. First aid. There we go. Take their weapons. They're not dead.
[1484.23s -> 1492.42s]  They just KO'd. Really? Okay. Well, no. They're doing, they're doing good. All right. Back to
[1492.42s -> 1495.94s]  what we were doing. What we're doing. We're going this way. I'd be able to losing blood.
[1496.82s -> 1514.57s]  No, we're all safe. Let me F5 it here. Wait, hold on. Okay. That just crashed the game. Thank
[1514.57s -> 1531.19s]  God I pressed F5. Thank God I pressed that button. Lorag just gave $50 right now. Thank you, Lorag.
[1531.19s -> 1534.47s]  Hope yourself and everyone in chat enjoyed the holiday season. Wish you guys nothing but the
[1534.47s -> 1546.79s]  best in 2019. Thank you. Thank you so much for $50, Lorag. 50. Hope you had a great holiday season
[1546.79s -> 1555.86s]  as well. Again, if you're coming in and you don't know what the title means, New Year's Eve,
[1558.50s -> 1562.66s]  in a little bit, we are going to go over the whole thing again. I just want to make sure
[1562.66s -> 1572.54s]  people weren't confused. Thank God I did that. Awesome music. This is the Spyro 2 official,
[1572.54s -> 1588.26s]  official soundtrack. But yeah, Lorag, you've given a shitload of money. So thank you so much.
[1590.26s -> 1598.12s]  But yes, I'm going to have to talk about it a handful of times on stream. No, no, no,
[1598.12s -> 1606.55s]  I was going to do that. Hey, whatever. Let's go. It's okay. Continue what we were doing before,
[1606.55s -> 1613.46s]  this way. It's going to be an award ceremony on New Year's Eve. Yeah, I'm going to be in the studio
[1613.46s -> 1622.02s]  again. So should be a lot of fun. I'm going to, we'll talk about categories in a few hours
[1623.90s -> 1629.18s]  and the nomination process. And then there'll be a essentially like a 12 hour voting period
[1629.98s -> 1644.57s]  tomorrow. Awards for worst moments of 2018 on stream. So we're talking worst stream in 2018,
[1644.57s -> 1653.70s]  worst joke, worst hair, uh, worst brand of soda, worst, uh, worst joke, worst joke that took more
[1653.70s -> 1660.44s]  than five minutes to make. It's going to be about 10 categories. There might even be more than that.
[1665.86s -> 1670.42s]  Uh, there'll be a, maybe like a couple of best dubs, but I'd really want to highlight the worst
[1670.42s -> 1686.50s]  of the year. And then I'm going to present them and each one of the categories is going to get
[1686.50s -> 1692.73s]  its own nominee video clips. And I've got, I already did the Amazon order. I'm going to have
[1692.73s -> 1695.29s]  polio. I'm going to be in a suit is going to be going in front of the green screen.
[1696.17s -> 1706.82s]  There's going to be a presentation for each one. So we're going to go, because this was so last
[1706.82s -> 1712.82s]  second, let me just make sure I'm safe to talk about this for a minute. Yeah, I am. Save it right
[1712.82s -> 1718.65s]  there. Is there ore right here? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. That's a, what is this?
[1718.65s -> 1728.41s]  That's huge. No way. Frog must get over here. Look at how big this is. What is this iron? No faction,
[1728.41s -> 1734.84s]  no workers. That's huge. That is a massive iron vein. That's a hundred percent quality.
[1740.09s -> 1745.75s]  They can both do it at the same time. How many people can you have? Three people at a time
[1745.75s -> 1754.44s]  can work on this. Let's, let's do it. Just get a few of them, right? Just like make sure I have
[1754.44s -> 1765.72s]  enough money. Just give me a minute. Give me a minute. I'm going to put it into, now I'm going
[1765.72s -> 1780.98s]  to put it in my backpack because I'm the strong one. I don't think I should fill the backpack
[1780.98s -> 1794.02s]  though. Have frog carry massive moon so he gets it. This dog is not going to be able to ever walk.
[1801.99s -> 1808.33s]  May as well fill all of them to train spring. Yeah. How are we doing on food? We're good.
[1808.33s -> 1814.28s]  Everybody's fed. We're good. Just got to get to another town. It's all about consistently staying
[1814.28s -> 1825.03s]  healthy while the whole keg gives up five community subs. Thank you. Okay. Five more
[1825.03s -> 1840.01s]  community subs. Sweet. Very, very, very kind of you. Thank you. But I'm so scared to walk around
[1840.01s -> 1845.67s]  over encumbered because when you do that, if somebody gets the jump on you, we're just going
[1845.67s -> 1861.14s]  to die out there. He's building a worker strength, right? Yep. Should be. You're going to die either
[1861.14s -> 1867.58s]  way. Not with that attitude. Can you buy a horse or something? I don't know. I'm not sure.
[1868.87s -> 1879.45s]  I really don't know what this game has to offer. You can sneak while mining without a downside
[1880.50s -> 1904.68s]  to get sneak points. How do you sneakily mine? Tap the whole vein. That'll take all day.
[1904.68s -> 1909.48s]  All right. That's okay. I'm going to fill up his inventory with rocks so he can walk slower.
[1910.44s -> 1922.66s]  Holy shit. Squards just gave out 10 community subs. That's like at least 30, 20, 30, 40 or
[1922.66s -> 1927.46s]  something community subs in the first 25 minutes, 30 minutes of the stream. Thank you guys so much.
[1928.18s -> 1940.70s]  What, he ate cookies? I don't even want to, where did I get cookies? Sign people jobs to stay
[1940.70s -> 1950.90s]  together? Yeah, that's a good idea. So a significant portion of this stream will be getting all the
[1950.90s -> 1955.85s]  categories set and giving all the rules for nominating and voting and everything. Holy shit.
[1956.25s -> 1963.40s]  Thank you Lake Drinker for five community subs. Thank you Anonymous Gifter for five community
[1963.40s -> 1970.82s]  subs. This is the high quality content. This is why everyone's given so many subs. Watching me
[1970.82s -> 1984.10s]  mine a iron vein. Thank you for that. Really though, guys. Thank you. He's way over encumbered.
[1984.10s -> 1994.04s]  This is it. We're out of here after this. That's good for now. Let's give you guys some jobs.
[1994.76s -> 1999.18s]  Everyone's over encumbered, right? They should be struggling to move. No, they're sneaking.
[2000.34s -> 2007.62s]  Well actually, if I sneak, doesn't that just build? Sneaking? It does, right? Hold on. If we just all
[2007.62s -> 2019.10s]  sneak together. Stealth. All right, so hold on. So we have a shitload of weight down, so we're
[2019.10s -> 2031.16s]  building strength. We have sneaking, so we're building stealth, right? Yeah. Now that's a
[2031.48s -> 2038.06s]  900 IQ play right there. That's probably like what you're supposed to do. So I'm just going
[2038.06s -> 2047.77s]  to sneak all the way to the next town. Let's get a quick save here. All right, let me get a good
[2047.77s -> 2051.05s]  look at the map because I want to make sure nothing crazy is going to happen. So I'm going
[2051.05s -> 2056.90s]  to stay on the road. There's no reason to go off road, although there might be for whatever is over
[2056.90s -> 2068.15s]  here. What is this? A vein? What is it? A copper vein? I don't know. Now stay on course. Build up
[2068.15s -> 2076.06s]  stats. Sneak all the way to the next town on times 10 speed. Bet three with five community subs.
[2077.78s -> 2088.38s]  Thank you so much for the fucking subs. Now let's stay on the course. A hem hack. What?
[2089.58s -> 2100.55s]  What's wrong? Is he all right? Harm unthrow, harm unthrow. She lived a life of anguish.
[2103.10s -> 2112.58s]  Oh, he's about to sing. For chained in rebirth, she was condemned to languish. Till one day,
[2112.58s -> 2122.92s]  she'd been ravaged by the high paladin, most vile, and she swore her dark vengeance with a
[2122.92s -> 2134.12s]  murderous smile. Who the fuck did you get this song? She stashed a long nail, forged a blade.
[2134.12s -> 2141.22s]  Great- oh my lord. Great Canadian fuck club, 20 community subs, five community- five community
[2141.22s -> 2148.71s]  subs, a maxi Kaspersky. She killed all the guards. Uh, that- what the fuck? Who just gave 50- somebody
[2148.71s -> 2153.27s]  just gave 50 community subs. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is happening too fast.
[2153.75s -> 2166.04s]  What happened? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's looking at us? Who's looking at us? Uh, I don't
[2166.04s -> 2175.24s]  understand who's staring at us. I'm panicking right now. Okay. All right. All right. Wait, wait, wait.
[2175.24s -> 2182.25s]  This is uh, I gotta say, I gotta look at this for a second because what on earth is going on? Did,
[2182.25s -> 2194.47s]  did somebody just give maxi Kaspersky five, great Canadian fuck club, 20, Torah tea, 50, and then
[2195.19s -> 2212.89s]  is it 100 or 50? 50? Wow. Uh, Torah, you guys are- you guys are out of control right now. Thank
[2212.89s -> 2219.29s]  you. Rampaging Scruppa 5, Torah 50 community subs. That's- that's two- what, 250 fucking bucks?
[2220.33s -> 2232.60s]  You just spent 250 dollars right now. Holy shit, guys. Did I ever say the F word? I'm sorry.
[2236.47s -> 2242.95s]  My goodness. I did not expect that today at all. I did not expect- I never expected, but
[2245.38s -> 2252.62s]  I appreciate it, guys. Thank you. And if you had a- if you got a community sub, awesome. Thanks a
[2252.62s -> 2260.62s]  lot, guys. But the real question is, what is- what is looking at me right now? Is there something
[2260.62s -> 2271.48s]  here? I don't know what I'm looking at. Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's a dog. Bone dog. Can I-
[2272.94s -> 2283.80s]  Goal is attacking others. 14 attack and 12 strength. Why are you so good? What?
[2284.44s -> 2291.98s]  He's gonna kill us all. This thing's gonna kill us all right now. Is there, like, something I can
[2291.98s -> 2304.95s]  do? Oh my god, this is bad. Uh, we're all over encumbered. Wait, hold on. 6 plus 4 minus 11
[2305.67s -> 2315.54s]  and 5 versus- what's the defense on? What do you got for defense? Dexterity, toughness 14,
[2316.34s -> 2325.53s]  strength 12. Should we try to kill it? I think we have to run, but nobody can run. All right,
[2325.53s -> 2339.59s]  stop sneaking, everybody. Um, do I have to drop everything and run? I think I do. Drop all the
[2339.59s -> 2372.49s]  ore on the ground. Drop everything and fight. Fine. Okay. Okay. Ready? Drop the backpack.
[2373.13s -> 2381.83s]  The backpack has so many vital things that I can't drop the backpack. Drop the backpack. This is too
[2381.83s -> 2397.06s]  much important stuff. Oh my god, but what if- what- I don't know. Okay. I'm at minus 2, 5.
[2397.70s -> 2403.48s]  Let's go. I think I'm ready. Get everybody selected here. Let's take on the dog. I'm ready.
[2404.20s -> 2419.10s]  So make sure everyone- we got everybody here. Everyone's selected. All right. Attack target.
[2419.10s -> 2432.49s]  Are we ready? Okay, here we go. Frog not selected. Oh shit. Why is the frog not selected? Oh, because
[2432.49s -> 2437.03s]  you're all the way back here. What the hell are you doing back there? All right. Nobody's sneaking.
[2437.03s -> 2456.44s]  Here we go. Attack target. Three, two, one, action. Get him! Hit him! Somebody hit him!
[2457.08s -> 2466.90s]  He's so much bigger than my dog. Somebody hit the fucking dog. Get him! Nice. Okay. What's his
[2466.90s -> 2472.26s]  health at? He's almost dead. Left leg. Left. Cut his leg off. Cut his leg off. Cut his leg off.
[2472.26s -> 2488.55s]  Well, he's distracted. Get it! Do it! Kill him! Is he dead?
[2490.23s -> 2508.97s]  There's no winner in this battle. I don't- what do you mean I don't have a med kit?
[2509.69s -> 2527.94s]  How do you not have a med kit? What? Oh, for the love of fucking god, everything's in the backpack.
[2531.58s -> 2548.97s]  Is anybody still alive? Dying. Dying. Dying. The character's unconscious. Character's unconscious.
[2549.69s -> 2576.66s]  How far away is that? That was 10 minutes ago? What do you mean no scumming? I have to scum this.
[2577.38s -> 2589.50s]  That was right when I was about to get on the road. Welcome to Kenshi. Welcome to the stream.
[2590.70s -> 2598.71s]  Yeah. We're fine. We're fine. Look at this. We're back here. Same deal. Everything's good to go.
[2598.71s -> 2614.63s]  I'm sneaking. Building power. This time that dog's not going to be here because it happened
[2614.63s -> 2621.29s]  right here. So I didn't lose any time at all because that was- there was a shitload of community
[2621.29s -> 2628.55s]  subs and I stopped. Yeah, we're good. We're fine. We're good to go. Dog is fine. Everyone's nice and
[2628.55s -> 2637.82s]  fed. Everyone's happy. Discovered Holy Farm. All right. Let's take a look. There's one here.
[2637.82s -> 2650.42s]  Holy Mines and Holy Farm. Let's pay a visit to the Holy Farm. I'm gonna save it right- hold on. Make
[2650.42s -> 2659.75s]  sure there's nothing here, right? Because if I save it here, we're good. Save it. Aren't you
[2659.75s -> 2672.30s]  wanted at the Holy Farm? I'm sure we'll find out. I don't see any enemies or anything. All right.
[2672.30s -> 2689.94s]  What's the next OST? To be fair, I'm on day 100 something. I have about 20 people. Tony Hawk.
[2690.66s -> 2696.66s]  You want to put on the Tony Hawk OST? But I'm gonna get the whole- the channel- this is gonna
[2696.66s -> 2728.66s]  get shut off. Too late. Yeah, rip the vlog. Oh, I'm not gonna put on the Tony Hawk soundtrack.
[2729.30s -> 2735.29s]  All right. How about just play it at like times two speed and pitch it down?
[2742.82s -> 2749.30s]  Dodge the filter. So I thought somebody said- somebody said Starbound. I thought you said
[2749.30s -> 2760.09s]  Starbucks. I was like Starbucks does not have an OST. The Starbucks OST is like- now that's what
[2760.09s -> 2774.89s]  I call music volume eight. Put on Sneak King OST. Oh, that's the Burger King game. Who the
[2774.89s -> 2780.74s]  hell would upload the Sneak King OST? Do you sit in your chair and you're like, you know what?
[2782.57s -> 2799.53s]  I think I'm gonna upload the Sneak King album today. No. It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist.
[2800.25s -> 2812.50s]  Yeah, I did Animal Crossing before. Simpsons hit and run. All right, I'm just gonna pick one. Let's
[2812.50s -> 2826.18s]  go Starbound. Starbound OST. This is six and a half hours? This is six hours and 40 minutes
[2826.18s -> 2838.36s]  of music in Starbound? What the fuck? Holy God. All right, here we go. We've saved it.
[2843.70s -> 2854.68s]  Holy military base. All right. I need to train. I need to get my characters leveled up. They're so
[2854.68s -> 2867.66s]  shitty. Holy military bases here. Holy farm. Was I here before? No, I wasn't here before, was I?
[2868.30s -> 2881.69s]  I was over at that one, wasn't it? Wait, what's wrong? What's going on here? I don't get it.
[2885.32s -> 2898.47s]  Heal yourself? I'm okay. Should I? I mean, if I'm at 93, 91, that's my left ink is bandaging. It's
[2898.47s -> 2919.80s]  not urgent. This is so dumb. Sneaking everywhere. Why do I have a pelican mouth? It's red. You're
[2919.80s -> 2936.89s]  bleeding. All right. Well, first aid. Wolf den 657 has been wiped out. Wolf den. What does that
[2936.89s -> 2945.48s]  mean? That keeps popping up. We can stop sneaking now. Let's just walk. I still have all the ore,
[2945.48s -> 2953.45s]  right? Yep. Somebody here want to buy it off me? Can we all go to the bathroom at the same time?
[2962.94s -> 2973.42s]  I mean, did I just hear shit noises? I think I actually did hear that. Did I? Am I making that
[2973.42s -> 3021.02s]  up in my head? Hold on a minute. Did I make it up? Is he going to the bathroom? I thought he was
[3021.02s -> 3025.64s]  doing it too. That's just the way he stands. I might be just, my brain might have just been
[3025.64s -> 3037.48s]  making it up for some reason. All right. I need to get these guys jobs to follow. Follow me. Follow
[3038.04s -> 3047.05s]  the job. That's good. It's just shift click. You stay close to me. You also stay close to me.
[3047.69s -> 3059.45s]  And also bodyguard. Staying close, bodyguard. Staying close, bodyguard. That works.
[3060.09s -> 3066.92s]  Let the dog go to the bathroom. The dog doesn't need to use an outhouse. Let's go back to
[3067.80s -> 3081.38s]  no reason within the music because obviously there is none right now. What is this music?
[3082.10s -> 3115.77s]  Starbound OST. That was a good one. Public building. For sale? Whoa, whoa. This building's
[3115.77s -> 3119.29s]  for sale. Some buildings are available for purchase. This panel will tell you how much
[3119.29s -> 3126.65s]  the building costs. I could buy this for 12,800 C's. You can also often buy destroyed buildings
[3126.65s -> 3135.32s]  for a cheaper rate. You must repair the building before it can be used. Really? That's kind of
[3135.32s -> 3151.56s]  cool. Play at 0.5 speed. Can I steal this? All right. Well, this is, I can buy this building.
[3152.52s -> 3159.38s]  What about in here? This is a public building as well. Holding alt. Oh. Who is running this
[3159.38s -> 3204.90s]  place? Oh, this person up here. I can't do that, man. I'm sorry. I can't handle that.
[3205.86s -> 3213.86s]  That was funny for five seconds. I need some good ambient, like Lord of the Rings music is
[3213.86s -> 3222.66s]  going to get this channel turned off. Uh, what about like, okay, Lord of the Rings royalty-free
[3222.66s -> 3238.30s]  music? Did somebody make a version that's royalty-free? Just do Skyrim. Hold on. Lord
[3238.30s -> 3254.60s]  of the Rings mix. Let's put this one on. All right. That sounds okay. Uh, looking to trade.
[3255.32s -> 3262.79s]  Let's see. No, this is not Lord of the Rings. This is a fake Lord of the Rings soundtrack.
[3262.79s -> 3275.72s]  Okay. Sell price. Sell it all. Get some money. And change over to you. You got lots of stuff in your
[3275.72s -> 3290.49s]  backpack. Speaking of backpacks, I wonder if I should have, uh, buy another one. This is designed
[3290.49s -> 3300.84s]  to fit a bowl. You got raw meat? Oh, I will take that raw meat. Cotton. What am I going to do with
[3300.84s -> 3309.77s]  that? Arrange that again. I got some more food. I'm, I need to kind of get in a major town here.
[3318.82s -> 3336.94s]  He's, is he still mining iron and not? Oh, yeah. Hold on. Let me fix it. That's, that's times two.
[3337.90s -> 3355.56s]  Normal. There we go. This is not Lord of the Rings. All right. So that's all I can really do here.
[3356.36s -> 3360.86s]  I do have some money. I don't know. What about animals? I can buy animals from this guy?
[3362.50s -> 3370.65s]  Talk to. Uh, got any animals for sale? Oh, would you look at that? What is this thing?
[3371.53s -> 3384.82s]  Look at this, this attack on the, I got what's 9,000. That was so good. 13 strength,
[3384.82s -> 3400.66s]  nine melee attack. I only have 1600 bucks. Can I buy like a baby cow? Anybody else want to join
[3400.66s -> 3421.06s]  me on my journey? I can't talk to you. You just like, you just get out of the way and stay out of
[3421.06s -> 3443.86s]  sight. Holy shit. What's in here? Oh, not worth it. Oh, there's a backpack. Bread. Oh, I didn't pay
[3443.86s -> 3453.53s]  attention to the, I just figured it was, I keep forgetting that when you open up a, when you open
[3453.53s -> 3458.65s]  up a box, there's a chance to steal. When it's on a table, you just, there's, there is no chance.
[3458.65s -> 3469.93s]  You just take it. Whatever. I really do want this though. God damn it. I keep forgetting that.
[3471.77s -> 3497.26s]  Simpson's hit and run OST. I think that's all I can do. I sold everything. What is this doing in
[3497.26s -> 3522.18s]  here? Wait, stay together. Stay together. What's wrong with you? Why can't you run this? All right.
[3522.18s -> 3535.06s]  No more Simpson's songs. Okay. I need something ambient, not like TV show theme songs blasting
[3535.06s -> 3544.15s]  in my fucking ear. That's just the McDonald's theme song guys. Where do you think they got it from?
[3544.15s -> 3586.38s]  No, no, no, no. Slow it down. A halo OST. McDonald's OST. All right, let's go. I sold all my shit.
[3587.02s -> 3592.92s]  I need to move down here, almost to this river. I'm maybe, go through like the purple zone maybe.
[3593.56s -> 3616.73s]  Let's go boys. I'm loving it. The Simpson. All righty then.
[3618.50s -> 3648.25s]  This is just Ace Ventura. Did you say boomer show? Ace Ventura is a movie starring Jim Carrey
[3649.74s -> 3660.25s]  And it is a classic. A little post here. I feel like I should build a little town or like at least a shack
[3663.88s -> 3668.22s]  What is that though? Hold on. What is this?
[3673.00s -> 3675.00s]  Is there a campfire over there? No
[3676.57s -> 3679.93s]  Song? A fly flew up my nose. Just get a grip
[3684.28s -> 3686.28s]  All right, there it is
[3686.28s -> 3688.68s]  Small copper resource. That's worth a lot of money
[3689.64s -> 3695.59s]  And the sandstorm
[3695.67s -> 3705.74s]  Let's get some copper
[3705.74s -> 3706.86s]  because
[3706.86s -> 3709.90s]  Uh, this one's 80. So don't mind the one back there
[3712.28s -> 3713.64s]  Same thing
[3713.64s -> 3715.64s]  Line it up. Sell it in town
[3717.00s -> 3718.12s]  Train
[3718.12s -> 3722.98s]  Both work together on this, please
[3724.14s -> 3726.30s]  Excuse me. Work together on this, please

[5425.08s -> 5427.08s]  That freed up the backpack
[5431.99s -> 5433.99s]  keep an eye on him because
[5434.47s -> 5436.87s]  I if he gets up and runs away, i'll be very very sad
[5441.72s -> 5443.80s]  Save it now. You're right. Yes, you're right
[5444.60s -> 5456.31s]  So I got so many backpacks full of money i'm gonna be able to buy a house for us to live
[5457.65s -> 5460.90s]  finally
[5460.90s -> 5466.34s]  Second backpack guy is perfect. And when he gets up I can take this stuff off him and then we can we can hurt him again
[5466.82s -> 5468.82s]  We level up our sword skills
[5475.94s -> 5478.74s]  Recovery coma minus 34. I gotta be ready for when that happens
[5479.78s -> 5491.56s]  Should be pretty close

[5523.10s -> 5525.74s]  Yeah, they stay on the road. It looks like unless don't come down here
[5526.70s -> 5541.93s]  We're not coming down here good. We're safe. Should be sneaking. You're right
[5542.65s -> 5549.75s]  This is day two in a row of mining
[5554.02s -> 5556.34s]  Almost done and we're not gonna have to do this again for a long time

[5588.62s -> 5590.22s]  Maybe a little less
[5590.22s -> 5593.00s]  We have enough room for one two, three, four, five six
[5595.08s -> 5597.80s]  All right. What do they stand up when they get to zero, right?
[5608.92s -> 5610.92s]  End of the mining voice. Yeah, it's getting close

[5625.42s -> 5627.42s]  Packable holy nation. Okay, that's fine
[5628.22s -> 5630.71s]  This guy's not affiliated with the holy nation. So
[5637.48s -> 5640.36s]  My labor has to be so high on this character at this point really
[5644.95s -> 5646.95s]  One two, three three more
[5654.39s -> 5658.07s]  Minus 28. Okay, I got time. You know, we're gonna put them over there and just kill them again

[5676.71s -> 5679.19s]  I just i'm sorry. I actually got scared. No, it's me talking
[5680.68s -> 5683.72s]  I saw the text and I freaked out. I'm sorry. I just screamed one more and that's it
[5690.68s -> 5692.15s]  Okay
[5692.15s -> 5693.03s]  Done
[5693.03s -> 5695.59s]  I have so many we're good
[5696.39s -> 5698.23s]  Everybody regroup
[5698.23s -> 5706.28s]  So let's take a look at what we got
[5706.28s -> 5708.28s]  Everybody's sneaking still right? So
[5709.82s -> 5711.82s]  We have one
[5712.86s -> 5714.86s]  one, two, three
[5714.94s -> 5716.65s]  four
[5716.65s -> 5717.69s]  bags
[5717.69s -> 5721.00s]  This guy's gonna get up very soon and when he does we kill him again
[5721.48s -> 5723.56s]  So who has the strength to pick him up? Probably you
[5727.10s -> 5736.54s]  Stealth ko him. No pick him up. I got my four backpacks
[5737.34s -> 5739.58s]  Let's all stay together
[5739.66s -> 5742.98s]  So i'm gonna give you the job to follow
[5744.25s -> 5745.69s]  you
[5745.69s -> 5746.81s]  follow
[5746.81s -> 5749.53s]  All right
[5749.53s -> 5755.53s]  Let's move save
[5755.61s -> 5757.61s]  Here's the real question. Where the hell am I gonna go?
[5759.32s -> 5761.32s]  I could go back here
[5761.85s -> 5763.85s]  to blister hill
[5765.26s -> 5768.78s]  I could could I build a base should I build a base here?
[5769.75s -> 5771.75s]  I could just keep going but i'm out of food though
[5772.55s -> 5783.66s]  I mean, this is the easiest one. Although i'm not sure where a town is
[5784.38s -> 5788.65s]  I can go down to this. Let's just take a look and see what's on this road
[5789.53s -> 5798.55s]  Wait to this guy's gonna get up in a minute. I need to be prepared when he does
[5801.22s -> 5804.42s]  Explain the rules for new years
[5804.42s -> 5805.94s]  Not in a minute
[5805.94s -> 5812.28s]  Minus 15 still out
[5812.52s -> 5815.54s]  Are we all sneaking?
[5815.54s -> 5820.20s]  Now we are safe before the trip. Yeah, I will
[5820.76s -> 5822.76s]  Let's make sure everyone's ready to go
[5823.16s -> 5833.78s]  I'm sure I don't I gotta be careful on the road though because of bandits and this dude's gonna wake up soon
[5833.78s -> 5835.78s]  So I kind of need to go off the road
[5835.94s -> 5841.22s]  Yeah, there's gonna be a new year's thing. We're gonna go over it. It's gonna be a significant portion of this stream
[5846.00s -> 5847.94s]  discovered stack
[5847.94s -> 5851.18s]  Well, there's stack
[5854.12s -> 5856.12s]  Looks like we're going there
[5858.38s -> 5861.98s]  All right. I don't see anybody on the road, but uh, i'm gonna keep an eye on i'm gonna keep my eye on him
[5862.86s -> 5869.32s]  Because once that gets to be about minus 10
[5869.96s -> 5874.28s]  From my he's when is he actually gonna get up minus 10 or zero?
[5875.08s -> 5888.74s]  in a second to load
[5888.74s -> 5893.14s]  Because this was such all right. Let me just break it down because there are quite a few people here now
[5893.86s -> 5896.26s]  So I might as well just go over it
[5896.26s -> 5898.82s]  So there was this was a very very last minute thing
[5900.55s -> 5902.55s]  I don't know if whoever was here yesterday
[5903.03s -> 5905.59s]  We talked about what was the worst stream that I did this year
[5906.15s -> 5908.71s]  And people were saying oh this one this one. It was just a joke, right?
[5909.35s -> 5910.39s]  but then
[5910.39s -> 5912.07s]  earlier today
[5912.15s -> 5913.85s]  Sitting in the chat
[5913.85s -> 5915.05s]  And it was
[5915.05s -> 5917.05s]  Hey, like wouldn't that be kind of funny?
[5917.46s -> 5919.46s]  If we just did an award ceremony
[5919.78s -> 5922.82s]  Where I go to the studio and I set up a podium and shit and I get in a suit
[5923.62s -> 5926.42s]  And we do a full 10 to 15 category
[5927.14s -> 5929.14s]  Worst stuff I did this year
[5931.85s -> 5935.69s]  And as like maybe like a couple of best of what happened this year, maybe
[5937.11s -> 5940.55s]  And we're talking that's the thing about categories is because this came up so
[5942.15s -> 5944.39s]  It wasn't very long ago, right? It was so recent
[5945.11s -> 5946.36s]  that
[5946.36s -> 5949.32s]  A significant portion of this stream is going to be coming up with categories
[5954.06s -> 5956.01s]  so
[5956.01s -> 5959.53s]  That we're going to do that. I have like probably seven or eight that I want to do
[5960.01s -> 5962.65s]  But we need to come up with some before the stream is over
[5963.13s -> 5967.85s]  So then you guys can nominate there's a channel in the discord that's currently locked because it's not you know
[5967.93s -> 5969.93s]  Whoever's not ready to do it yet
[5970.01s -> 5972.73s]  So after we do the categories
[5973.53s -> 5975.63s]  Then you guys are going to give nominations
[5977.02s -> 5978.86s]  And then a day from now
[5978.86s -> 5982.00s]  I'm going to close the nominations
[5982.00s -> 5986.40s]  You're going to vote in the discord because i'm going to put a poll up in the discord because i'm not going to be streaming over
[5986.40s -> 5987.68s]  The next two days
[5987.68s -> 5992.35s]  Because this is going to take a lot of time to get ready
[5992.35s -> 5993.23s]  so
[5993.23s -> 5996.03s]  After today's stream the next stream will be on new year's eve
[5998.08s -> 6000.83s]  Because i'm going to cut up videos
[6000.91s -> 6002.75s]  with all the nominees
[6002.75s -> 6007.16s]  So let's say it's like worst overall stream of 2018 is the final obviously final
[6008.60s -> 6010.08s]  Award
[6010.08s -> 6015.12s]  I'm going to just whatever the nominees are i'm going to it's going to be here are the nominees and here is a presentation of
[6015.12s -> 6016.80s]  the worst streams
[6016.80s -> 6018.86s]  the worst jokes
[6018.86s -> 6022.06s]  You know, i'm going to do 10 15 different categorical videos
[6027.96s -> 6038.04s]  That's what's going to happen and i'm going to obviously give a speech for every category to talk about what I feel about it
[6047.39s -> 6054.67s]  Worst frame was your wow one. That wasn't 2018 though. I'm pretty sure that was 2017
[6063.42s -> 6065.42s]  Stop the yoga music. All right. Yeah
[6072.28s -> 6074.28s]  Worst new character is going to be one
[6084.43s -> 6085.63s]  Yeah
[6085.63s -> 6092.14s]  Yeah, the worst joke there's going to be worst overall joke of 2018 and then there's going to be other categories as well
[6092.70s -> 6093.90s]  as if
[6093.90s -> 6095.10s]  as if
[6095.10s -> 6098.43s]  What was I trying to say there like?
[6098.91s -> 6101.28s]  Ie is what I was trying to say
[6101.28s -> 6103.92s]  Worst joke that took at least five minutes to set up
[6109.26s -> 6112.38s]  Worst noise like the fucking worst noise i've made
[6113.02s -> 6118.33s]  all year

[6128.76s -> 6132.84s]  And then you'll see clips of all the different worst hairs that have happened over the years
[6132.84s -> 6134.84s]  And you're gonna pick what the worst fucking one was
[6135.16s -> 6139.64s]  No, let's turn that off now. Turn it back on
[6140.96s -> 6142.96s]  worst category

[6789.44s -> 6792.88s]  I can't I can't pick him up with this arm
[6797.71s -> 6802.08s]  Well, hold on what's wrong with me
[6806.30s -> 6808.30s]  Oh boy, there's food
[6810.28s -> 6816.36s]  I need to that's worth money
[6821.82s -> 6823.58s]  You need to get up
[6823.58s -> 6828.06s]  This is so dangerous being on this road with I can't just stay here. I have to all right
[6831.24s -> 6836.36s]  You're gonna get up. We're gonna hide over here
[6836.36s -> 6838.36s]  Away from any bad bandits
[6838.60s -> 6857.08s]  I'll make a campfire. We'll eat
[6857.08s -> 6858.12s]  Right here
[6858.12s -> 6862.60s]  And then I need okay. I got some food
[6862.84s -> 6867.20s]  I need to go a little further out right here
[6872.94s -> 6884.01s]  Up. Okay. I just splinted the dog campfire
[6888.91s -> 6899.44s]  Campfire camping camp bed doesn't cost anything but a campfire here anywhere in the wild
[6901.05s -> 6904.33s]  Uh, oh that was weird. Okay right here
[6905.40s -> 6907.40s]  And then we're gonna make a campbed
[6907.40s -> 6908.76s]  right here
[6908.76s -> 6915.32s]  Make three of them
[6915.32s -> 6921.77s]  Building why are you standing in the fire? All right building. Wait, I didn't did I can't make those
[6922.94s -> 6924.94s]  Three of them for three people to be in the bed
[6925.42s -> 6929.13s]  Select a construction to check its status
[6929.13s -> 6933.69s]  This shows how many building materials I need to complete the construction once the condition is bar filled the construction is complete
[6936.06s -> 6937.96s]  build
[6937.96s -> 6939.24s]  I need
[6939.24s -> 6943.07s]  What do I need?
[6943.07s -> 6948.67s]  Sleeping bag one more building material will be needed. Why need one sleeping bag? Well, all right, whatever cook the food
[6954.48s -> 6959.34s]  Don't eat them both
[6959.34s -> 6965.76s]  All right, how are we doing recovery coma with dog recovery coma?
[6969.55s -> 6972.04s]  All right
[6972.04s -> 6974.28s]  Uh, I guess now i'm just gonna sit here
[6977.95s -> 6980.59s]  I'm off the road. I should be away from anybody
[6981.31s -> 6986.80s]  I don't have any sleeping bags. So I can't do that take off taunt
[6988.80s -> 6990.80s]  They're gonna be in a coma for a long time
[6992.60s -> 6994.04s]  Save the game
[6994.04s -> 6999.87s]  So this is like post attack. We got attacked
[7004.04s -> 7006.78s]  All right now
[7006.78s -> 7008.78s]  We times three idle
[7009.39s -> 7011.39s]  Wait, hold on. Is there anything I can get?
[7011.63s -> 7013.63s]  I need to go maybe look for supplies or something
[7016.51s -> 7017.79s]  What's over here?
[7017.79s -> 7028.92s]  Is there anything I can do here?
[7028.92s -> 7031.39s]  Right arm is getting better
[7031.39s -> 7033.34s]  very slowly
[7033.34s -> 7036.14s]  I don't think this is anything. Can I fit any more stuff?
[7036.78s -> 7040.43s]  Because I know that there is
[7040.43s -> 7042.75s]  A few things over here animal teeth. I think I can pick them up
[7047.37s -> 7048.33s]  um
[7048.33s -> 7051.04s]  I can't
[7051.04s -> 7055.74s]  I still have this meat. I need to get rid of uh, I need to put this back on him
[7056.46s -> 7057.90s]  I need to go back
[7057.90s -> 7070.84s]  Okay
[7070.84s -> 7073.68s]  trade
[7073.68s -> 7076.00s]  So I need to put away some of this stuff
[7078.20s -> 7080.41s]  He's stacked, right?
[7080.41s -> 7083.12s]  Why not?
[7083.12s -> 7086.96s]  Oh fuck who ate it? Did I eat that? He's the only person that's eaten
[7087.76s -> 7092.03s]  I need to be able to take the skin and there's another thing of meat over there
[7101.98s -> 7112.92s]  Can't pick that up. Why is it longer than that? I mean what was that all about?
[7113.80s -> 7115.32s]  All right, that's good
[7115.32s -> 7124.81s]  Okay cook the meat
[7124.81s -> 7126.81s]  Should just do it automatically, right?
[7126.81s -> 7130.33s]  Yeah
[7130.33s -> 7131.77s]  What was that noise?
[7131.77s -> 7144.01s]  Seriously though, what was that?
[7144.01s -> 7146.01s]  Whoa, no get away from me
[7147.32s -> 7150.04s]  What are you doing over here? Why are you over here? Uh
[7152.67s -> 7154.75s]  What are you doing here? Is he gonna know?
[7156.41s -> 7159.37s]  I have to sneak away, but is he gonna see these two?
[7160.36s -> 7162.52s]  He smells the meat you asshole
[7201.12s -> 7207.84s]  I have a crippled arm. Can I play dead?
[7210.80s -> 7212.80s]  Hold on. How do I play dead?
[7225.47s -> 7246.40s]  Where's play dead? He's going the other way. Oh, come on
[7247.62s -> 7254.41s]  RNG, please be in my favor go the other way and I get that meat out of there
[7254.81s -> 7273.04s]  Okay, that's fine. Good play dead play dead. What do you guys got on recovery time? So long
[7273.96s -> 7275.96s]  You not so much but can carry the dog
[7276.04s -> 7283.71s]  Okay, I think it's time. I'm just gonna sneak back and forth like this while I do times three speed
[7318.17s -> 7323.72s]  Fight with honor. You can't fight with honor with a broken arm against 15 people
[7326.64s -> 7332.70s]  We gotta move cam. I gotta pick some I gotta pick you up and we gotta go
[7333.02s -> 7340.97s]  Maybe not RNG. Come on
[7343.28s -> 7350.72s]  He just needs to wake up and then we can get the hell out of here minus 35
[7350.80s -> 7352.80s]  There's no way I can speed that up at all
[7363.87s -> 7375.13s]  Food. Oh free food. Come on
[7378.88s -> 7409.69s]  Somebody's dead too. Come on kill the kill them and move on put out the where are they they're coming this way, aren't they?
[7412.19s -> 7422.12s]  They're right there. I could kill these three easy. No, I don't have I can't even use my weapon. They're all killing each other
[7422.12s -> 7423.40s]  This is perfect
[7423.40s -> 7434.04s]  Let me sneak over there because they get on the road and I got free supplies right here
[7435.79s -> 7438.11s]  Hold on. Let me I gotta dump this stuff over here
[7438.65s -> 7445.47s]  Temporarily, I got a bunch of shit. I'm gonna just put it down right here, right?
[7445.55s -> 7449.31s]  Make sure nobody comes over here because this probably supplies and food
[7453.39s -> 7476.48s]  Okay, i'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna save it right here. There they are. All right, come on get up there
[7480.83s -> 7492.09s]  We have a couple of bodies. Yep. Come on get over there body number one
[7497.68s -> 7499.68s]  You got nothing important
[7500.00s -> 7502.00s]  With the wolves the body too right here
[7504.17s -> 7509.50s]  Nothing worth taking nothing. Where are those wolves?
[7511.34s -> 7520.43s]  Right here. Come on. Really?
[7520.51s -> 7531.16s]  Yes
[7531.16s -> 7541.52s]  All right, go bandits are these bandits are these holy men holy men? Okay, we're good
[7541.84s -> 7545.63s]  What about some more supplies back? We should be fine after this
[7553.42s -> 7566.67s]  Get another camp built campfire. All right, get the food up there. It should be already doing it, right?
[7575.00s -> 7577.02s]  All right
[7577.02s -> 7580.81s]  Are we good? I don't see anybody should be fine
[7581.63s -> 7583.63s]  What is all this? Oh, that's my okay
[7583.95s -> 7588.24s]  Well, I need to it's fine food's more important right now
[7597.63s -> 7600.43s]  They can still eat right if they're unconscious
[7601.07s -> 7610.88s]  Or they have to wait till they get up
[7610.88s -> 7613.28s]  These pelts are worth. Okay, what's worth more money?
[7614.24s -> 7618.30s]  the pelts or the
[7618.30s -> 7620.75s]  Let's see
[7620.75s -> 7622.75s]  We're good. Save it again
[7624.91s -> 7628.11s]  How do you fix your arm? I need a splint and I already used it
[7628.75s -> 7630.59s]  I don't think I have any more
[7630.59s -> 7634.49s]  I do put it on the ground here
[7634.81s -> 7645.92s]  Didn't I already do this?
[7645.92s -> 7647.92s]  All right, so that leaves me with
[7649.02s -> 7653.00s]  240
[7653.00s -> 7655.56s]  Yeah, these are 175. So that's okay. I'm all right with that
[7656.36s -> 7658.36s]  these sell for
[7658.52s -> 7660.60s]  Not very much each. I need to free up some space
[7661.48s -> 7663.58s]  I'd rather have two more
[7663.58s -> 7665.02s]  coppers
[7665.02s -> 7668.86s]  Let's open up your bag
[7668.86s -> 7672.89s]  We need to trade with you
[7672.89s -> 7679.16s]  Let's put these in here
[7679.16s -> 7685.31s]  All right
[7685.31s -> 7687.31s]  get these on
[7687.87s -> 7690.80s]  you
[7690.80s -> 7692.80s]  Rearrange this I can take some more
[7699.82s -> 7701.50s]  And that's good
[7701.50s -> 7704.14s]  All right. Now you just have to recover and we have to get the hell out of here
[7704.70s -> 7712.52s]  You've been healed
[7712.52s -> 7714.52s]  All right minus 28
[7714.76s -> 7715.72s]  Save it
[7715.72s -> 7721.44s]  Where are you going make a plan now? That's true. Okay
[7722.32s -> 7727.76s]  I mean, I already had a plan. I was gonna go to stack. It's right there. It's right here
[7730.36s -> 7732.36s]  Maybe I should just run him to stack
[7732.52s -> 7735.07s]  Or run the dog to stack and then he can get up later
[7737.29s -> 7742.97s]  That might be worth doing
[7742.97s -> 7744.97s]  Dog is not going to get up for a long time
[7745.13s -> 7748.17s]  Neither will you
[7748.17s -> 7749.61s]  splint the dog
[7749.61s -> 7752.94s]  Uh, did I already did I thought
[7753.26s -> 7755.95s]  I'm gonna have a splint right here. I have first aid here
[7757.95s -> 7758.99s]  splint
[7758.99s -> 7760.51s]  No, I can't
[7760.51s -> 7764.65s]  Can't splint myself either
[7764.65s -> 7766.65s]  I mean, I don't know how far away that is though
[7766.97s -> 7774.96s]  I wonder if that's a good idea. Just you know, I think that's what i'm gonna do
[7775.68s -> 7778.25s]  pick up the dog
[7778.25s -> 7780.57s]  Get to stack put dog somewhere safe
[7782.81s -> 7785.61s]  And then when he gets up eventually here block to stack
[7790.52s -> 7792.92s]  That's the plan. Let's hope nothing goes wrong
[7795.60s -> 7797.61s]  stack
[7797.61s -> 7801.45s]  Good luck canned roth
[7801.45s -> 7803.93s]  Let's go. I gotta move. I can't just sit out here
[7804.57s -> 7807.90s]  The sacrifice needs to be made
[7807.90s -> 7812.80s]  I've got the material
[7812.80s -> 7815.68s]  I need the backpack. Fuck
[7815.68s -> 7817.77s]  Give me the backpack
[7817.77s -> 7819.77s]  Just in case something terrible happens to you
[7827.48s -> 7829.74s]  backpack
[7829.74s -> 7832.04s]  All right
[7832.04s -> 7835.50s]  Get on there. Let's see. We got
[7835.98s -> 7839.26s]  We got all these materials. All right. Good luck. See you later
[7839.90s -> 7844.20s]  let's head
[7844.20s -> 7846.52s]  to
[7846.52s -> 7852.70s]  Stack it's right here. Hopefully this is like not a hostile town or something. That would be a horrible pain in the ass
[7853.95s -> 7855.95s]  Good luck. See you soon. Take care of yourself
[7856.67s -> 7858.67s]  I hope you're okay in like
[7858.81s -> 7860.43s]  15 minutes
[7860.43s -> 7870.40s]  Everybody on the road
[7870.40s -> 7875.34s]  I think we're safe the dog. I think the dog. No, the dog is not dead. The dog is recovering
[7876.72s -> 7879.96s]  Everybody's fine
[7879.96s -> 7881.96s]  Sneaking. Yes. I'm sneaking because it gives you points
[7882.60s -> 7884.60s]  Take a look
[7884.60s -> 7887.40s]  stealth stealth is increasing because i'm sneaking
[7891.39s -> 7893.24s]  Or it was
[7893.24s -> 7894.76s]  Is it not anymore?
[7894.76s -> 7900.86s]  What it was doing it before?
[7900.86s -> 7906.17s]  It only increases when you're near people
[7912.17s -> 7916.59s]  Well, never mind
[7925.23s -> 7927.23s]  Okay, i'm almost there. All right. How you doing over here

[7940.36s -> 7951.60s]  He still has everything. He's fine. What did he take? He didn't take anything. I still have all the material. What did he even take?
[7958.76s -> 7963.85s]  Food did I even have any food? He took the food
[7968.62s -> 7984.40s]  Where am I? All right. Hold on. I should have put out the fire. Just get up there. I'll make you still let you good

[8206.80s -> 8207.68s]  when
[8207.68s -> 8210.32s]  There's been like eight out of ten times
[8211.55s -> 8213.95s]  You guys made me do something that I wasn't supposed to do
[8214.75s -> 8216.75s]  It's like the boy who cried wolf
[8216.99s -> 8223.29s]  Let's see your wares
[8223.29s -> 8224.25s]  sell
[8224.25s -> 8238.81s]  Look at that money
[8238.81s -> 8240.81s]  Not not even half of it 6500 bucks

[8250.25s -> 8253.37s]  Well wouldn't oh wouldn't you wouldn't you? Yes, you would

[8266.88s -> 8268.88s]  So that is 6700
[8269.60s -> 8271.60s]  How are we doing over here?
[8273.00s -> 8274.52s]  Minus 15
[8274.52s -> 8277.64s]  I might have to come out and get him just put the dog down somewhere to hang out
[8280.09s -> 8282.09s]  The stream that cried book
[8283.79s -> 8285.87s]  Yeah, it's he's I gotta come out and get him

[8299.63s -> 8301.63s]  Dog will just hang out over here somewhere
[8301.95s -> 8306.52s]  Put down dog
[8306.52s -> 8309.80s]  Dog is just recovering dog doesn't have any items or anything. So
[8310.92s -> 8315.56s]  And i'm bringing it all the way back here to go. I can run now. I actually can sprint
[8315.88s -> 8320.06s]  So let's save it
[8320.06s -> 8324.78s]  And get here turn it on. I need to go pick you up because yeah, I don't think you're gonna get up in time
[8326.65s -> 8329.16s]  It's riskier
[8329.16s -> 8330.52s]  Who's on this road?
[8330.52s -> 8336.73s]  Probably servants. That's fine
[8344.03s -> 8347.73s]  What a disaster. I haven't done anything. We put on osts
[8349.79s -> 8351.79s]  And then I got killed three times
[8353.98s -> 8355.98s]  All right, make sure there's nothing on the ground here
[8356.70s -> 8358.54s]  There is some animal teeth
[8358.54s -> 8365.21s]  Might as well just get it
[8365.21s -> 8367.82s]  All right back it up

[11124.22s -> 11126.22s]  Well, you don't have any
[11126.30s -> 11134.65s]  All right, how to research tech to learn new tech you can buy blueprints from merchants or you can research the tech yourself
[11135.45s -> 11137.45s]  The research you must have a scientist
[11137.85s -> 11143.69s]  Assigned to your research bench select a squad member hold right click on your research bench and select a use machine
[11144.81s -> 11148.97s]  Research people depend on your assigned scientist science skill stat
[11150.59s -> 11152.59s]  That is a tongue twister
[11152.84s -> 11157.32s]  assigned scientist science skill stat assigned scientist science skill stat
[11159.29s -> 11162.25s]  Next you need to select tech to research like tech from the panel
[11162.65s -> 11166.17s]  Select any tech you want to research by left clicking it. You can queue up as many as you want
[11167.90s -> 11171.90s]  So somebody kind of has to stay back here and do that. The question is who?
[11174.16s -> 11175.52s]  i'm gonna say
[11175.52s -> 11176.96s]  can't rock

[11235.16s -> 11238.12s]  huge labor athletics huge and
[11240.64s -> 11243.68s]  I think he just I think can roth is just gonna have to be the
[11244.94s -> 11247.50s]  The one that does all the stuff that has nothing to do with fighting
[11251.16s -> 11254.59s]  strength 28

[11289.68s -> 11292.22s]  Everybody hang out
[11292.22s -> 11294.46s]  I gotta find another person to be in the squad

[11308.48s -> 11310.88s]  If you're searching i'm a bit of a scientist myself
[11311.60s -> 11314.80s]  That's all right, though. I mean

[11514.38s -> 11518.62s]  use
[11518.62s -> 11520.51s]  show research
[11520.51s -> 11523.39s]  gear storage item storage public sales
[11525.27s -> 11527.05s]  crafting
[11527.05s -> 11529.05s]  Two hours I need a book
[11529.45s -> 11531.45s]  farming industry training
[11531.53s -> 11533.93s]  Simple training dummies. I need two books
[11534.65s -> 11545.72s]  What do you mean books?
[11545.72s -> 11547.88s]  storage box or storage box
[11555.58s -> 11561.10s]  Things will go a lot smoother if we organize an efficient method to store and distribute our raw material. Otherwise things are going to get jammed up
[11562.86s -> 11565.66s]  storage or storage steel bars steel iron plates copper
[11569.74s -> 11571.26s]  Books are next door
[11571.26s -> 11581.53s]  There's so much going on here
[11581.53s -> 11582.89s]  You sell books
[11582.89s -> 11589.05s]  What you got?
[11589.05s -> 11592.60s]  Okay book a book from the university of
[11593.38s -> 11597.08s]  Machinists everything they need they learn is compiled in the books like this one
[11598.72s -> 11602.24s]  So how many I just I have to buy book. That's it
[11603.82s -> 11605.82s]  Nothing else just book
[11608.62s -> 11615.44s]  Steal it
[11615.44s -> 11628.80s]  There's nothing here to take
[11628.80s -> 11634.64s]  Stealing is bad. I'm just gonna buy the books. How many don't need three two. I need the training dummy three books
[11635.44s -> 11636.96s]  Was it two or three?
[11636.96s -> 11644.76s]  Because that's three six nine
[11648.54s -> 11650.54s]  three six nine
[11650.54s -> 11654.86s]  Because I'm gonna need these for other stuff too, right?
[11662.30s -> 11665.34s]  three for lockpicking training two for okay
[11672.24s -> 11673.44s]  So that's
[11673.44s -> 11677.04s]  I need five
[11677.04s -> 11678.70s]  All right
[11678.70s -> 11682.70s]  That's all i'm gonna do right now so I can at least I can do lockpicking practice
[11683.50s -> 11690.43s]  Let's get done frog's gonna stay back his arm is all messed up
[11693.87s -> 11696.19s]  so use
[11696.19s -> 11698.38s]  so research
[11698.38s -> 11701.04s]  training
[11701.04s -> 11730.16s]  what
[11730.24s -> 11738.92s]  Okay, simple training dummies damn rookies are useless keep getting beat up because they can't hit anything a basic training
[11738.92s -> 11741.40s]  dummy would let them train their attack skills up to about level five
[11744.91s -> 11746.64s]  and then
[11746.64s -> 11750.88s]  Learning to pick locks is hard to get started. It's too late to learn once you're locked in a cage training
[11750.88s -> 11752.88s]  Is needed to get you put in the ladder
[11752.96s -> 11753.92s]  Okay
[11753.92s -> 11756.14s]  Get it
[11756.14s -> 11766.97s]  three hours lock picking three hours like real time or in game time
[11767.45s -> 11775.21s]  Who's working on this?
[11775.21s -> 11777.21s]  Am I working on this?
[11777.45s -> 11781.88s]  Engineering right
[11781.88s -> 11783.96s]  Science, okay
[11783.96s -> 11797.26s]  He's got it. So where can I put the training dummy?
[11797.82s -> 11800.62s]  I want privacy
[11800.62s -> 11806.14s]  So we've got show the research. All right, let's speed it up
[11807.02s -> 11811.69s]  Wait ever people can we can all do it at the same time, right?
[11815.92s -> 11818.97s]  use
[11818.97s -> 11820.99s]  use
[11820.99s -> 11823.23s]  No
[11823.23s -> 11825.23s]  No, only one person can be here. Okay
[11826.68s -> 11828.44s]  Only one at each bench
[11828.44s -> 11831.07s]  So we do just kind of have to sit here
[11831.47s -> 11834.84s]  sit here
[11834.84s -> 11837.56s]  There's a huge fight going on and i'm not seeing it
[11838.36s -> 11845.52s]  where
[11845.52s -> 11868.59s]  Huge fight. There's nobody out here. Like I didn't get baited. Did I?
[11869.23s -> 11877.20s]  Almost done. There's no dog bed. Well, that's all right
[11877.76s -> 11886.09s]  Who's training science?
[11886.09s -> 11888.57s]  Uh, it is frog musk is the one that's doing it
[11889.27s -> 11893.58s]  Specifically because frog musk is currently very injured
[11894.30s -> 11896.54s]  And it's gonna take a while for them to heal
[11899.32s -> 11901.76s]  All right, we got a training dummy
[11901.76s -> 11903.76s]  Well, hey, why are you doing that?
[11903.76s -> 11906.72s]  Not because I moved him
[11906.72s -> 11909.52s]  So now build let's just see what happens here build
[11911.55s -> 11913.53s]  training dummy
[11913.53s -> 11917.05s]  Need four iron plates. Shit. What if I put them outside?
[11917.93s -> 11921.37s]  Oh, man, this is such a small shack. I can't put them anywhere
[11924.03s -> 11925.87s]  Where am I gonna put this?
[11925.87s -> 11930.09s]  It's gonna have to go right next to the bed
[11936.11s -> 11938.43s]  Make a second floor. I can't afford that
[11942.04s -> 11944.04s]  So I need four iron plates
[11948.11s -> 11951.23s]  Now all of you leave it alone frog musk is the one that's going to be using it
[11958.84s -> 11962.20s]  The rest of you
[11962.20s -> 11968.48s]  Are gonna have to go on a mission here
[11968.48s -> 11971.76s]  There's the auto save
[11971.76s -> 11973.76s]  These buildings are unexpandable. Okay
[11976.32s -> 11977.92s]  so I have this
[11977.92s -> 11982.75s]  group here
[11982.75s -> 11984.19s]  I need

[13853.82s -> 13855.82s]  flavor of ice cream
[13856.91s -> 13860.11s]  Okay, make this a little smaller

[13874.97s -> 13877.85s]  I like that. I don't know why it's such a stupid thing
[13878.49s -> 13888.25s]  Spelled cat doesn't matter
[13888.25s -> 13892.41s]  So that's one two, three, four, five, six, seven eight nine ten eleven. I want about 15
[13893.79s -> 13900.75s]  Worst stream worst joke worst hair worst joke that took more than five minutes worst character worst chat experience and that means
[13901.55s -> 13904.44s]  What experience you had right? We're talking

[13949.76s -> 13951.76s]  No, we're gonna have worst new character
[13959.15s -> 13964.75s]  I think these are all right because remember each one of these i'm gonna I get to cut together a presentation for them
[13968.60s -> 13973.88s]  So for over for if for instance, so the nomination process is only we only got about a day to do this
[13977.92s -> 13982.96s]  So i'm whatever it's probably going to be about six to ten nominees. I'd say somewhere around six is probably good
[13984.03s -> 13987.71s]  And me and the mods are going to pick the nominees based on suggestions
[13988.52s -> 13989.64s]  Whatever ones, you know
[13989.64s -> 13992.44s]  If people are writing a bunch of the same one people have different suggestions
[13992.76s -> 13998.04s]  The nominees are going to be put into the categories and we're gonna be i'm not going to be streaming over the next two days
[13998.04s -> 14004.51s]  This is very important. Very very very very important. I am not going to be able to announce to you guys
[14004.99s -> 14009.79s]  Hey, uh, so the you can vote now go and vote right? I'm not going to be able to do that

[14020.68s -> 14022.76s]  So the voting is going to happen
[14023.93s -> 14025.77s]  Off stream when i'm not there
[14025.77s -> 14028.25s]  You're just going to have to check in on the discord over the next day or so
[14028.73s -> 14034.41s]  Because the voting the categories are going to be up there. The nominations will stop tomorrow night and the voting will stop
[14035.32s -> 14037.08s]  uh
[14037.08s -> 14044.12s]  Not even probably 12 hours after that because then the whole next day i'm going to be working all day to cut up these presentations
[14047.04s -> 14054.11s]  So let's think about this worst stream worst joke worst hair best noise best overall use of cardboard
[14054.97s -> 14063.36s]  Uh, best flavor of ice cream worst use of music and best use of music
[14066.24s -> 14069.85s]  Oh, hold on. I gotta get back over here and collect these
[14070.65s -> 14079.21s]  Oh, that doesn't stack. It's not a stacking backpack. Shit. Okay. That's good. How you doing frog musk?
[14083.69s -> 14086.01s]  I mean, okay this work this worst we could do
[14086.73s -> 14091.48s]  Who the hell is this?
[14091.48s -> 14096.14s]  This the mechanical shop owner quick get out there get go go go get that stuff
[14101.53s -> 14103.53s]  Fuck you. She did it right when I got there. Ah
[14104.60s -> 14109.96s]  Get back in here
[14109.96s -> 14115.08s]  I mean this is also you could also do worst. Okay, worst overall stream worst overall joke. What about worst overall moment?
[14116.01s -> 14132.99s]  Right close the door. I got it. Don't do too many categories
[14133.47s -> 14137.71s]  Yeah, I mean because each category is going to take about five to ten minutes to get through them
[14140.41s -> 14144.49s]  Coming up with these on the fly. Oh, yeah, because this this came up less than four hours ago
[14144.49s -> 14147.90s]  Five hours ago is that and I got the studio time so it's happening
[14150.54s -> 14152.54s]  Uh worst internet
[14152.54s -> 14157.36s]  Problem, that's a good one. That is a really good one actually
[14163.32s -> 14164.60s]  worst
[14164.60s -> 14172.62s]  internet issue
[14172.62s -> 14180.89s]  best internet
[14180.89s -> 14182.65s]  worst overall stream
[14182.65s -> 14185.93s]  I can make sure but I don't think I want to do best overall stream because that's like oh
[14185.93s -> 14189.05s]  What was the best stream? I want to know what the worst fucking stream was
[14195.44s -> 14212.62s]  Best clip. All right, that'll tell that's all right best clip. I think that's pretty good
[14213.72s -> 14218.04s]  One two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
[14225.63s -> 14227.79s]  That's just the most used clip. Yeah
[14230.78s -> 14233.42s]  Uh, I got a better idea. Yeah, best clip is not going to work out
[14236.68s -> 14247.23s]  Find that one for me guys
[14247.23s -> 14249.23s]  Okay, here's the two categories that are coming up
[14257.88s -> 14264.97s]  I hate this category so much but it's going on there. I've done it so many times that you could like very I don't know
[14271.10s -> 14274.38s]  I'm gonna be up in a suit at the podium like going over these
[14275.02s -> 14277.02s]  We're gonna have to sit through and watch those
[14281.98s -> 14283.98s]  They're all the worst
[14288.46s -> 14293.42s]  All right, we can't get too crazy because I only have like I gotta i'm gonna put in like triple time to make this a reality
[14294.06s -> 14298.80s]  So I don't we got literally today into tomorrow afternoon
[14299.74s -> 14302.06s]  to nominate and then from there forward
[14302.78s -> 14304.22s]  less than a day
[14304.22s -> 14310.35s]  For voting so we really can't go. This was just a last second idea that I thought was gonna be fun. So
[14311.07s -> 14318.00s]  Let me make sure we got 15 right is it 15?
[14318.72s -> 14323.52s]  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

[14388.00s -> 14390.00s]  Or greasy moment
[14390.00s -> 14392.48s]  No, just worse that you get the idea worst sweat
[14394.48s -> 14397.84s]  worst game no, I don't the worst game that's
[14403.93s -> 14407.71s]  loudest scream, but the loudest scream doesn't work because all you have to do is just

[14449.47s -> 14452.75s]  I gotta put these back in a better place here. So we got best
[14453.39s -> 14459.63s]  Let's cut this because the best is gonna be on a different section. You know what i'm saying? This is gonna be like this
[14461.44s -> 14465.58s]  Anything that's worst has to be I don't want that many best
[14468.89s -> 14471.21s]  Okay, so it's all worst worst worst worst

[14529.80s -> 14532.60s]  You guys remember like the worst analogy. You remember what stream it was
[14534.01s -> 14538.49s]  Because think about it you've got there's the archive channel that has every stream of the last year, right?
[14538.97s -> 14545.98s]  But like you're gonna go back and figure it all out. You only got like one day to figure that out
[14550.52s -> 14556.51s]  Do not underestimate best gamer moment. Oh, I like it best game. Okay, we're done here
[14556.99s -> 14570.60s]  Best gamer moment worst gamer moment and that's good because I can tell you there's been at least at least two
[14571.16s -> 14574.36s]  Best gamer moments i'm gonna oh wait, they might even be like one or two
[14574.84s -> 14581.18s]  But that's even funnier to me that there's only one nominee or two and there's like 20 nominees for worst
[14585.36s -> 14589.92s]  Yeah, best best jex moment and worst germa gaming moment. Yeah, and that's it
[14592.22s -> 14596.52s]  I gotta call it there because it's gonna take a lot of time. So and some of these categories
[14596.92s -> 14611.15s]  I might have to just straight up delete like the ice cream one's fine. I want to know what you guys think. There you go
[14612.83s -> 14622.51s]  Let me move this worse. All right, let's go over these one more time
[14624.33s -> 14631.68s]  So we've got oops wrong thing
[14634.09s -> 14636.35s]  So here are your categories
[14638.52s -> 14645.32s]  One two, three, four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seven seventeen categories
[14648.09s -> 14652.09s]  Worst so here you go worst overall stream. What is the worst member?
[14652.33s -> 14663.61s]  What is the worst fucking stream that i've done in the whole year? Think about it. There's a lot of streams this year
[14663.69s -> 14667.93s]  What is the worst one i've done that you were just like that stream was fucking terrible, right?
[14669.72s -> 14674.52s]  What is the worst joke that i've done this year that you were just like that wasn't funny. That was just not funny
[14674.68s -> 14682.14s]  Uh, I didn't think it was funny to you. That was awful. There's been a couple of those probably at least one worst hair
[14684.41s -> 14688.09s]  You turned on the stream and you saw the face came and you were like, whoa, holy fuck
[14688.65s -> 14696.60s]  That looks really bad worst joke taking more than five minutes to set up
[14697.16s -> 14701.60s]  Sometimes I will pause the stream and I will go do something and in five ten minutes
[14701.60s -> 14703.76s]  We'll go by and i'll come back and like press play on it
[14704.40s -> 14709.40s]  And it's awful that's happened sometimes and to even it out. We'll do okay fine
[14709.40s -> 14727.92s]  We'll do best joke taking more than five minutes to set up as well to you know, even it out because that's 18
[14736.17s -> 14741.34s]  All right. So you got worst joke taking more than five minutes best choke taking more than five minutes to set up
[14741.98s -> 14744.22s]  Worst new character. There's been a handful of characters
[14744.30s -> 14751.39s]  It's been about five to ten new characters that you've seen on stream, which is the one that is the worst
[14757.23s -> 14765.32s]  What was your worst chat experience where you were looking at the chat room and you just
[14766.12s -> 14770.68s]  Holy shit, man. You guys need to chill the fuck out. Like what are you guys doing? This chat sucks
[14770.68s -> 14779.00s]  Like one of those moments. So think about that
[14781.31s -> 14784.03s]  What I don't know how i'm gonna do that by the way
[14785.07s -> 14787.07s]  Because I don't have access
[14787.84s -> 14789.52s]  It doesn't matter
[14789.52s -> 14795.69s]  Uh, worst noise that i've made that you hated that you wish I never make again
[14798.60s -> 14801.24s]  worst new meme that you guys say
[14806.28s -> 14807.56s]  worst
[14807.56s -> 14812.84s]  new meme
[14812.84s -> 14818.44s]  Okay, something that came from just something that on the channel or something that we said that you say that I say
[14819.37s -> 14821.29s]  Not a joke, but like a reference meme thing
[14821.29s -> 14826.17s]  You know what I mean the worst category of the year here
[14828.22s -> 14835.74s]  Why is that up here? It's kind of i'm not even
[14844.97s -> 14846.89s]  Worst internet
[14846.89s -> 14848.89s]  issue from last year
[14848.89s -> 14854.64s]  Where it was unwatchable to a point or you just hated it and it was awful and you left the stream
[14854.96s -> 14865.76s]  The best noise that I made all year in, you know contrast to the worst one best overall use of cardboard
[14866.08s -> 14873.74s]  There's been a couple a few times where that's happened, you know, what's your best flavor of ice cream?
[14874.22s -> 14876.54s]  No, just delete this one. This one sucks
[14877.10s -> 14888.16s]  That's gonna win worst category keep it. That's the best one
[14889.66s -> 14893.82s]  No, but like that's good
[14893.90s -> 14897.26s]  All right, find best flavor of ice cream nominate your favorite ones
[14897.66s -> 14909.10s]  We need the worst peter and we need the best peter and then we need the worst
[14910.19s -> 14915.82s]  Worst one is more fuck. Uh worst sweat moment for you
[14915.98s -> 14921.74s]  I just was disgusting to look at and you couldn't take it and the worst breakdown I had on stream in 2018
[14921.74s -> 14923.72s]  Remember these all have to be
[14923.72s -> 14925.72s]  2018 you can't go back
[14925.74s -> 14928.78s]  like oh remember when like he told stardom
[14929.32s -> 14933.32s]  Remember when he made that video? No, no, no, no 2018 this last year
[14944.51s -> 14951.52s]  No, we can't I it's gonna take so much work for me to put this together already a good 18 categories is gonna be fine
[14958.52s -> 14962.92s]  I can't even say that out loud because I don't want to give you bias, but somebody just said something really funny
[14966.64s -> 14971.88s]  Uh
[14971.88s -> 14977.58s]  All right, no, no best jebait worst jebait. I can't this I this isn't your categories
[14977.66s -> 14982.49s]  I can't do much more
[14982.49s -> 14988.33s]  One two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen
[14989.92s -> 14992.70s]  no gamer moments, uh
[14992.70s -> 14996.16s]  Where are they? Did they not get in?
[14998.04s -> 15000.12s]  It was best and worst gamer moment. Did I type it in?
[15000.76s -> 15021.10s]  Apparently not
[15021.10s -> 15023.10s]  All right. Now that's 20 categories
[15023.42s -> 15035.18s]  Let me separate them again so you can take a get a good look at it because best needs to be done
[15036.57s -> 15041.12s]  I'm actually gonna do this
[15041.12s -> 15043.36s]  Uh, yeah, let's go like this instead
[15044.08s -> 15049.71s]  We'll start with the best just because that you know, obviously
[15055.21s -> 15058.01s]  Worst internet issue or it's noise. Okay
[15064.14s -> 15065.66s]  worst hair
[15065.66s -> 15069.68s]  Okay
[15069.68s -> 15074.24s]  Because the the culmination of this whole thing guys is the worst stream of the year is the big award
[15074.88s -> 15080.59s]  That's the big one. So that everything's there, right? One, two, three, four
[15081.55s -> 15086.09s]  Eight, nine, ten, eleven, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, what happened to what happened to one?
[15088.01s -> 15095.55s]  Did one get removed?
[15095.55s -> 15104.75s]  Which one got removed?
[15104.75s -> 15118.75s]  Best best flavor of ice cream peter. All right. There you are. There are your 20 categories
[15119.69s -> 15122.83s]  so
[15122.83s -> 15125.16s]  in
[15125.16s -> 15135.71s]  We're gonna have rules here in there's a channel on the discord right now. The channel is called nominees
[15136.43s -> 15138.76s]  what you're going to do
[15138.76s -> 15141.00s]  is
[15141.00s -> 15143.00s]  You don't just like spam
[15144.38s -> 15148.22s]  In that channel you have to do just like in previous setups
[15150.49s -> 15156.01s]  You need to post your nominations in that thread in the format of what the category is
[15158.71s -> 15162.04s]  category
[15162.04s -> 15165.32s]  And your nominee, right? So you have to type it in
[15166.04s -> 15168.35s]  What's the category dash?
[15168.75s -> 15170.99s]  Here's the moment i'm talking about dash
[15172.59s -> 15176.06s]  Where it is because it's you can't just write
[15176.46s -> 15182.14s]  Oh go to uh, remember the stream you did when you like fucking bit your finger and you like farted
[15182.62s -> 15185.98s]  I have no idea what you're talking about. You're gonna have to give me a link to either a clip
[15186.54s -> 15190.94s]  or to a a timestamp to a video and again, there is the
[15191.34s -> 15192.06s]  uh
[15192.06s -> 15199.02s]  The vod channel has a shitload of these almost all of these streams that i've ever done in 2018 are on that channel
[15204.30s -> 15206.30s]  So we need to know
[15206.62s -> 15208.56s]  What stream it was?
[15208.56s -> 15214.86s]  And a timestamp if you have it or clip because it's going to be hard to figure that out if you just write a random sentence
[15217.60s -> 15221.84s]  So either if it was something that happened in the last 60 days twitch is fine
[15222.56s -> 15226.48s]  You can clip it if you want if it's happened recently and you know put it in there
[15226.80s -> 15233.32s]  But if it's something that happened a long time ago back in like january or february something then we're going to need timestamps
[15233.64s -> 15238.17s]  which is on the uh
[15238.17s -> 15246.12s]  There's a channel that is the archive channel, although it's not an official channel. Uh, i've talked to the
[15246.92s -> 15256.33s]  Owner of the channel a few times then that is it's a huge resource. So again
[15256.89s -> 15261.56s]  That channel is not for talking. It's currently locked right now
[15261.88s -> 15266.67s]  But that channel is only for nominations. Remember you got it. I'm gonna let's paste it here
[15270.54s -> 15276.99s]  I think you grump clump with this great format here. All right. Here you go. Bingo
[15277.63s -> 15287.34s]  That's what you need to do
[15287.34s -> 15302.27s]  And if the hour minute seconds I did that can someone put me back in the discord?
[15302.83s -> 15304.72s]  What
[15304.72s -> 15309.68s]  What about worst category is worst category is right. It's there worst category
[15309.68s -> 15320.35s]  You gotta pick whatever category that you hear that you think sucks. I want to make sure everyone gets it
[15321.21s -> 15325.55s]  Do we do we get it because i'm not going to be able to talk about this again until new year's eve
[15326.97s -> 15328.49s]  so once
[15328.49s -> 15334.12s]  Me and the mods whoever wants to help work on it. We're going to pull out nominations
[15334.12s -> 15336.76s]  There is no it's just like the christmas stream
[15337.16s -> 15342.92s]  We're gonna find you know ones and maybe uh, oh this one this particular one like 10 people have nominated this
[15343.40s -> 15344.92s]  20 people have said this same thing
[15344.92s -> 15350.01s]  Oh, you know like this guy said, you know, we're gonna pull them out for just like the suggestions for christmas then
[15351.22s -> 15352.92s]  tomorrow night
[15352.92s -> 15359.40s]  Voting is going to be open for about 24 hours. Not even maybe 12 hours because I gotta start working on this
[15360.62s -> 15367.47s]  So I will not be able to tell you this again discord discord. They will be that channel is going to be there. They will be another
[15368.19s -> 15370.67s]  Major there'll be another channel probably put up that is
[15371.47s -> 15376.89s]  Voting and there will be a link to a voting website
[15378.83s -> 15380.83s]  It'll be there within the next 24 hours
[15390.14s -> 15397.90s]  Yeah, and i'm that this channel is going to open in about probably like an hour or so probably like an hour or two
[15398.97s -> 15405.00s]  Post an example for the channel. Okay here is here's an example for instance category, uh worst
[15405.88s -> 15409.56s]  stream of the year, right like well or we worst, uh
[15410.20s -> 15412.20s]  Worst overall stream make sure we keep we keep them
[15412.99s -> 15415.23s]  You got to use the the text that you see on the screen here
[15415.92s -> 15422.00s]  So worst overall stream make sure the text is correct take a screenshot right now if you have to worst overall stream
[15423.21s -> 15427.13s]  Uh link to the moment. Let's say that's uh, you know
[15427.61s -> 15434.40s]  Hey, I i'm just I pick this stream because and then maybe maybe like uh, for instance like link to moment
[15434.40s -> 15438.24s]  I'm going to fake website link like a hyperlink, right?
[15439.13s -> 15441.13s]  And then if you can do a timestamp in there as well
[15441.13s -> 15447.48s]  That's good, and maybe you could give like a dash maybe like a sentence, you know, he
[15448.46s -> 15450.46s]  was shitfaced
[15450.46s -> 15451.74s]  and couldn't
[15451.74s -> 15453.44s]  figure out
[15453.44s -> 15455.95s]  How to open the door?
[15457.28s -> 15463.08s]  And you know you give like you can give like a small maybe like one sentence reason, you know what I mean?
[15466.27s -> 15469.15s]  Timestamp hour. Let's see like for instance like one
[15469.71s -> 15472.75s]  At 34 here's a perfect example of why I think this
[15473.56s -> 15478.99s]  You know like here let me go category worst overall stream link to moment fake website link
[15478.99s -> 15482.59s]  Oh, he was shitfaced and he couldn't figure out whatever timestamp if if you can do it
[15483.55s -> 15485.87s]  Hour 34 right for a reason
[15491.13s -> 15494.09s]  And that is also the reason why this stream is going to be cut short tonight
[15494.09s -> 15502.24s]  I'm not stopping now, but please don't post if no, no, no, I mean like i'm you don't post any fake links
[15508.03s -> 15511.29s]  Thanks for making a copy pasta
[15511.37s -> 15521.52s]  Yeah, it'll be the rules will be there. I'm in studio on New Year's eve again 7 pm eastern. Sorry 7 pm pacific
[15523.24s -> 15526.84s]  I already have a bunch of the stuff ordered that's ready to go. This is the only thing we got to do
[15527.32s -> 15537.60s]  And we have about three days to get it ready. Somebody just wrote already got the worst noise boys
[15538.24s -> 15546.48s]  Are you allowed to use clips from other streamers points of view?
[15547.44s -> 15550.08s]  um
[15550.08s -> 15555.44s]  As long as it happened in the last year and it's somebody that I know personally, you know what I mean?
[15559.64s -> 15563.72s]  I can't spell cat. It doesn't matter. I just wrote it. I did fast. I don't have grammarly installed
[15566.40s -> 15571.36s]  So, uh, i'm i'm before the stream is over. I'm gonna put this back up. But here are your categories
[15573.42s -> 15575.74s]  That channel will open in an hour or two
[15576.30s -> 15581.36s]  Just getting set up. So think about it now, you know, think about it while you're here
[15581.92s -> 15590.35s]  You know while you have a moment, you know, like one person
[15590.91s -> 15593.07s]  What?
[15593.07s -> 15596.42s]  kim
[15596.42s -> 15597.48s]  italics
[15597.48s -> 15601.39s]  Star, I don't I don't really know. I mean very many people
[15611.44s -> 15617.79s]  Vinny
[15617.79s -> 15618.99s]  burger boy
[15618.99s -> 15629.13s]  Are we both hitting this?
[15629.13s -> 15630.33s]  drake
[15630.33s -> 15642.83s]  But yeah that I mean when we talked about earlier, but cutting the stream short it is to get that ready
[15645.13s -> 15651.85s]  Because once I know the timestamps once I know the clips once I know I have to make them put them together add effects to it
[15654.06s -> 15656.38s]  make little presentations for all the categories
[15658.54s -> 15661.50s]  And that's going to take me at least a couple of days to do
[15671.72s -> 15675.00s]  Will drake be at germa con there is no such thing as germa con
[15681.85s -> 15683.85s]  Dabs for dinner. Thanks for the five dollars
[15684.76s -> 15686.76s]  And we're almost done doing this
[15686.84s -> 15691.47s]  I'm not going to fill the whole inventory. There's only so much hit
[15691.95s -> 15694.27s]  Uh rock with stick you guys can handle
[15699.72s -> 15703.56s]  So again, i'm sorry for like it's gonna end up being like a five hour stream tonight
[15706.54s -> 15708.62s]  But this will be fun. It will be a fun night
[15714.97s -> 15719.61s]  Five five five community subs not five dollars. Thank you for the five community subs

[15741.44s -> 15747.20s]  It just is
[15747.20s -> 15749.52s]  That's it. Yeah. Yeah, let's go. Let's go. I got plenty of shit

[15789.36s -> 15792.36s]  All right sell value. Okay
[15792.68s -> 15798.67s]  That's not bad. These prices aren't that great, but it's okay
[15800.09s -> 15802.09s]  1751 we got a lot of these
[15803.05s -> 15810.18s]  All the money I spent is back. That's good. It feels pretty good
[15810.82s -> 15818.70s]  Almost a 10 000 again
[15818.70s -> 15820.70s]  No, what do you have?

[17602.56s -> 17604.90s]  when
[17604.90s -> 17606.66s]  To be nominated
[17606.66s -> 17612.71s]  All this stuff is way too expensive. Although not this is not that bad
[17614.10s -> 17615.96s]  Yes, it is. It's too much
[17615.96s -> 17620.12s]  No, I don't want to spend that kind of money here. I'm just looking for a new companion
[17620.76s -> 17649.36s]  Somebody in here you have shit your pants. It was right after you lost a pinwheel for a second

[17687.35s -> 17689.35s]  Really? This is on this character
[17689.43s -> 17692.24s]  There's another one right here, isn't there?

[17723.35s -> 17725.35s]  Yeah, it's kind of what i'm trying to do
[17726.07s -> 17732.96s]  I would have figured it happened with a 33 chance to open but apparently we are okay save it
[17740.86s -> 17743.20s]  55 percent these are all so expensive
[17744.48s -> 17754.61s]  I'm gonna be here. Look at all these locked more locked stuff

[17771.08s -> 17773.08s]  That's pretty important
[17775.44s -> 17782.74s]  Holy chest plate
[17783.14s -> 17789.25s]  A plastic spork just gave out five community subs

[17798.76s -> 17802.44s]  All right, I come but all right, but once all right, but twice
[17803.73s -> 17805.49s]  two times
[17805.49s -> 17807.49s]  How am I supposed to react to this?
[17809.49s -> 17812.53s]  You know what I mean? Okay. So if you're in front of the judge right now
[17814.31s -> 17816.63s]  You know you you you're walking down the street
[17817.27s -> 17820.71s]  And you like rip a bag of chips out of somebody's hands. Okay
[17823.11s -> 17825.11s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on
[17826.79s -> 17829.67s]  Somebody you're walking down the street. Somebody drops a bag of chips
[17830.74s -> 17834.82s]  And then they kind of walk away for a minute you grab the bag of chips as they're continuing to walk
[17837.16s -> 17838.84s]  And you take them and you eat them
[17838.84s -> 17841.83s]  You then the lady turns around says hey, what the hell are you doing with those chips?
[17841.83s -> 17845.27s]  Those are mine. I just dropped them like a minute ago. I came back to get them
[17845.27s -> 17848.71s]  What are you doing? You eating them and then you come in front of me. I'm the judge
[17849.59s -> 17852.95s]  You get arrested for that and you say it was a mistake. I'm, sorry
[17853.27s -> 17856.95s]  I didn't mean to do that. It was a mistake and I go. All right, you know, it was a mistake
[17857.51s -> 17865.24s]  That's okay. By the way, I have a bag of chips in my hand. You can just be more careful while i'm talking
[17866.04s -> 17868.04s]  You walk up to the podium
[17868.04s -> 17870.04s]  And you take the chips out of my hands
[17870.76s -> 17874.96s]  And you eat them in front of me and then you tell me that that was a mistake again
[17878.12s -> 17884.31s]  How am I supposed to believe you at that point? Worst analogy category? No, i'm just saying
[17885.03s -> 17887.19s]  You how do you make the same mistake twice?
[17888.26s -> 17902.00s]  And when they're supposed to be accidents worse and that there's no worse analogy nominee. It's not up there
[17902.48s -> 17908.82s]  So you good luck
[17908.82s -> 17919.75s]  There is no worse than allergy and I fucking forgot. Did I save it? That wasn't a joke
[17919.75s -> 17923.03s]  Well, how is that a joke? That was me explaining how absurd it is
[17923.75s -> 17928.47s]  For you to get caught doing something and then do it again and say there was a mistake again
[17929.03s -> 17935.00s]  How am I supposed to judge that? Is the judge gonna you know, let's say there was a judge here
[17935.00s -> 17938.28s]  He'd be like, I don't know about this one. That was kind of fucked up. Jeremy
[17938.84s -> 17958.16s]  Somebody said, you know, German it makes sense
[17958.48s -> 17972.68s]  Thank you. Oh, come on flip a coin
[17973.24s -> 17981.92s]  If I had these odds at the fucking blackjack table, I would be a trillionaire
[17983.78s -> 17985.78s]  No, I would lose all my money
[17987.54s -> 17989.70s]  Oh, that's the worst analogy in 2018
[17990.42s -> 18006.88s]  Fucking god, I need this shit. I'm gonna crash the game
[18009.36s -> 18012.88s]  Come up to me with a bag of chips and I sit there. The lady drops the chips
[18018.23s -> 18020.23s]  Somebody got it. I uh, whatever
[18020.55s -> 18025.03s]  There's no worse than allergy category. Oh my fucking god go to vegas
[18025.99s -> 18038.15s]  He come to me with chips in his hand
[18044.58s -> 18045.78s]  Yes
[18045.78s -> 18046.98s]  finally
[18046.98s -> 18050.66s]  It only took five six coin flips
[18051.46s -> 18057.33s]  You're in vegas right now. What the what?
[18059.16s -> 18063.04s]  Where the fuck am I? What where am I? I'm serious. Am I all right?
[18063.60s -> 18068.72s]  Uh, this is uh, I like this heart protector

[18087.04s -> 18090.31s]  Why did you sneak in here?
[18091.80s -> 18096.02s]  I did not tell you to do that
[18096.02s -> 18101.43s]  Now we both have to hide
[18101.43s -> 18103.43s]  Well more room, I guess
[18104.07s -> 18110.66s]  It's not worth taking
[18110.66s -> 18114.34s]  I mean it kind of is this stuff all that pretty have better armor
[18115.30s -> 18116.66s]  got caught
[18116.66s -> 18127.67s]  Can I get a list of the categories again? Absolutely you can
[18128.31s -> 18154.95s]  There are categories. We're not gonna get caught
[18156.61s -> 18158.61s]  There were more categories. No, there weren't
[18161.78s -> 18164.02s]  One two, three, four five six
[18164.66s -> 18170.34s]  Seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty. There's 20 categories
[18172.64s -> 18175.76s]  Where's worst analogy? It was never on the list is what you're referring to
[18177.94s -> 18181.62s]  Best shpe moment. Oh my god. I would know I would never put that on here

[18185.70s -> 18193.73s]  The best shpe moment. Oh my god
[18198.61s -> 18201.19s]  I'm still hidden
[18201.19s -> 18203.19s]  This thing is worth so much
[18204.13s -> 18206.13s]  Why is a rusty chain shirt worth?
[18206.99s -> 18211.80s]  2000
[18211.80s -> 18220.60s]  Save it. I said it 30 times this year. I I did no such thing
[18229.30s -> 18232.90s]  You'll put on best and worst peter, but not best shpe moment
[18232.90s -> 18236.74s]  You know why because peter is a relevant thing from this year
[18237.70s -> 18241.84s]  Shpe is a video series I made in
[18242.62s -> 18243.92s]  2012

[18356.55s -> 18358.55s]  I got two days to do this
[18358.55s -> 18374.84s]  All right, get them off before the stream turns off. I'll make sure to show them again, but the first let me steal one more
[18375.64s -> 18377.59s]  thing
[18377.59s -> 18379.03s]  Make sure it's saved
[18379.03s -> 18384.84s]  Who has a higher chance to do this?
[18384.92s -> 18388.56s]  You do not what about frog musk? No, he's not he's too far away
[18389.28s -> 18394.02s]  I got an okay. Nice. You got another one

[18409.12s -> 18417.32s]  trigger an event here
[18417.32s -> 18425.01s]  Well, there's the answer to that question. I'm gonna leave this is supposed to be a three hour stream

[18448.50s -> 18451.14s]  That was never supposed to be a contest in the first place
[18451.86s -> 18457.70s]  So i'm not going to do that
[18457.70s -> 18460.23s]  So i'm i'm good
[18460.23s -> 18465.03s]  I I do have to stop streaming though if I have any chance to get most of this done

[18770.77s -> 18772.53s]  Take a look at this
[18772.53s -> 18776.69s]  There's gonna be a good set of rules in that channel that channel's not
[18777.25s -> 18782.61s]  For discussion that channel's not to talk about what you think if you want to talk about that
[18783.17s -> 18789.65s]  What you think nominees should be then maybe we should i think i'm gonna have i'll make a new damn channel right now
[18793.27s -> 18794.61s]  right
[18794.61s -> 18796.61s]  That channel will be called
[18796.69s -> 18798.85s]  Maybe nominee discussion, you know i'm saying

[18842.44s -> 18846.36s]  Because there's a lot of categories and what if you had the things you want to nominate for?
[18846.52s -> 18849.16s]  Oh man one per category, but that's a lot
[18858.63s -> 18866.10s]  Is one per category can can that be handled do you think that's handleable over the next two days
[18882.55s -> 18884.71s]  Well, all right one per category
[18887.78s -> 18889.94s]  You have to nominate one per category
[18893.01s -> 18894.13s]  We can do it
[18894.13s -> 18899.65s]  We're uh, well i'm telling you i'm i'm putting in like triple time until this this stream on new year's eve. So

[18910.47s -> 18912.23s]  Good luck
[18912.23s -> 18914.39s]  And I think i'm gonna make another channel here

[18924.44s -> 18926.44s]  nominee discussion
[18927.08s -> 18930.47s]  I'd spell everything is so wrong how I just felt that nominee
[18932.45s -> 18940.29s]  Discussion you can talk in here about it. Let me go into here
[18946.74s -> 18951.60s]  Here we go
[18951.60s -> 18955.65s]  So sending you can you guys use it? Are we good?
[18956.61s -> 18967.72s]  Okay
[18967.72s -> 18973.48s]  Good if you want to talk about stuff talk about it there do not talk about it in the nominees channel only the nominees discussion channel
[18974.28s -> 18982.79s]  And if there's anything else I need to do
[18984.13s -> 18986.13s]  For I think that's good
[18993.04s -> 18995.04s]  Grump clump has put rules
[18995.84s -> 18997.84s]  in that channel
[18998.55s -> 19003.67s]  Go take a look
[19003.67s -> 19005.67s]  And make sure whatever you're doing is from
[19006.29s -> 19008.29s]  2018 not like
[19008.29s -> 19009.43s]  2016
[19009.43s -> 19011.43s]  It has to have happened this year
[19011.51s -> 19015.56s]  Is there only there's only gonna be one winner per category
[19016.44s -> 19021.40s]  There's gonna be like six plus nominees per category, but only one of them is going to win
[19025.28s -> 19030.88s]  What flavors of ice cream were invented this year? Oh boy, uh, whatever
[19031.44s -> 19032.64s]  It don't matter
[19032.64s -> 19039.80s]  Vote on discord entries with emotes or repost
[19041.14s -> 19043.38s]  I would say if one's already there
[19044.18s -> 19046.18s]  Like thumbs it up. You know what I mean?
[19046.58s -> 19050.50s]  Because if you if it's the exact same moment the exact same thing you're talking about
[19050.82s -> 19054.66s]  Just make sure that it's seen make sure that me and the mods know that a bunch of people wanted that one
[19054.66s -> 19057.27s]  You know what I mean?
[19057.27s -> 19060.47s]  If you have to put it again, then I mean we're gonna have to deal with that
[19060.55s -> 19063.03s]  But if you see it already because it's gonna be a lot of submissions. So
[19063.99s -> 19069.46s]  If you see it already try and with that have a great rest of your night. I'll see you on new year's eve

[19085.94s -> 19088.74s]  Of a recommendation at this point. I would I think it's fun
[19090.21s -> 19092.61s]  Maybe we'll come back right to it after new years. I don't know
[19093.33s -> 19096.69s]  But maybe we'll take a break from it for a day come back. I I want to play it some more so
[19097.94s -> 19100.74s]  I'd like to make my whole community of frogs and dogs
[19104.39s -> 19108.15s]  But thank you shoe shrimp for the three dollars. Hey germa. Remember how I said my bird was dying
[19108.63s -> 19111.59s]  I went to the vet and his liver is somehow all better
[19112.39s -> 19114.39s]  The vet said it's nothing short of a miracle
[19115.03s -> 19119.59s]  Just comes to show that things always get better. Thanks for getting me through the bad moments in between
[19120.55s -> 19121.91s]  awesome
[19121.91s -> 19123.91s]  That is fantastic news
[19131.09s -> 19137.89s]  Really happy to hear that
[19137.89s -> 19145.92s]  No issues good. Thank you for the three dollars and i'm really happy to hear about the bird doing. Okay
[19150.72s -> 19154.96s]  Thank you divas for the three dollars again. No message from divas just always giving three dollars
[19156.10s -> 19159.70s]  Consistently constantly almost every I think every single stream. Thank you
[19160.50s -> 19163.51s]  Timmy tim tan thanks for the one dollar during the christmas eve stream
[19163.51s -> 19167.51s]  I saw a guy come in and say oh this guy again, and then I assume he left
[19173.99s -> 19176.31s]  Thank you to lorag again for 50 dollars
[19178.69s -> 19181.33s]  Hope yourself and everyone in chat enjoy the holiday season
[19182.31s -> 19184.61s]  read the message before but
[19184.61s -> 19186.61s]  Thank you so much lorag if you're still here
[19188.53s -> 19190.53s]  You are incredibly generous. Thank you
[19190.85s -> 19196.10s]  I really appreciate it
[19196.10s -> 19200.02s]  Thank you jewels for the five dollars. Hey germa. I don't know if you talked about this yet
[19200.58s -> 19204.98s]  But have you seen a doctor for your gluten intolerance or digestive issues? Did you receive any good advices?
[19205.38s -> 19211.38s]  I have the same issue. So hope you're doing well germa heart. I had a ton of tests done last week
[19212.10s -> 19214.90s]  And because of the holidays i'm waiting back for results on a couple of them
[19214.90s -> 19217.14s]  But for the most part my blood work is very normal
[19218.26s -> 19220.82s]  I had food allergy test. That's not back yet
[19221.94s -> 19223.54s]  I have
[19223.54s -> 19228.34s]  A couple of things that it was a breath test that I did to check for bacteria in my
[19228.90s -> 19231.06s]  Stomach or intestines or something. That's not back yet
[19231.86s -> 19234.18s]  But the general blood work was fine
[19235.24s -> 19238.60s]  And i'm just kind of waiting for a few things, but i'm not going to know till after new years
[19240.34s -> 19243.86s]  Uh, so I don't know that I don't have very much good advice for
[19244.58s -> 19247.38s]  Uh gluten intolerance because i'm not sure if that's what I actually have
[19248.34s -> 19251.94s]  I mean it would make sense if it was true, but I just don't know
[19252.90s -> 19255.22s]  Uh, but digestive issues I've had for a long time
[19256.18s -> 19259.88s]  I've had IBD for seven years now eight years
[19260.68s -> 19263.00s]  Almost a decade
[19263.00s -> 19265.72s]  And the best advice I could find is because it's so different for everybody
[19266.60s -> 19271.32s]  Just you got to find the things that you shouldn't be eating and just try not to eat them
[19272.20s -> 19278.36s]  There's a lot of foods that just randomly trigger IBD symptoms and they're different for everybody
[19279.24s -> 19282.37s]  Try to substitute those things
[19282.90s -> 19285.54s]  I got breathalyzed at the doctors. No, it was a
[19287.27s -> 19289.27s]  It was a Healabac to pylori test
[19289.75s -> 19291.75s]  and then I did another one which was
[19292.23s -> 19293.99s]  a like sucrose
[19293.99s -> 19295.19s]  breath thing
[19295.19s -> 19296.55s]  Whatever it was
[19296.55s -> 19298.79s]  I didn't get breathalyzed at the doctors
[19307.16s -> 19309.16s]  Vinny's playing mother three. See ya
[19310.29s -> 19312.77s]  Well, thanks for coming. I'm sure that'll be a fun time
[19313.41s -> 19323.19s]  Sure, that's gonna be pretty interesting. So what happens when I drink too much wine? No
[19323.91s -> 19327.67s]  But take care of yourself jules. Hopefully you can figure it out
[19328.77s -> 19330.77s]  trying to figure out medical problems is
[19331.89s -> 19337.01s]  It's the worst thing ever because it could just be anything. I've had this weird back and stomach pain for
[19337.65s -> 19342.13s]  Seven months. I've no idea what it is. I've absolutely no idea. I might just be getting old
[19342.53s -> 19346.77s]  Is this a symptom? Is this something is this is nothing actually wrong with me? Am I just fucking old? I don't know
[19349.32s -> 19353.06s]  I don't know
[19353.06s -> 19356.74s]  We'll find out soon enough. But thank you. Thank you the whole keg for the five dollars
[19356.74s -> 19358.74s]  We're just spreading belated christmas cheer
[19359.62s -> 19362.82s]  Yes, this game is great for your kind of streams
[19365.30s -> 19369.86s]  Yeah, I like just kind of hanging out but sometimes it don't have to be crazy. You know what I mean?
[19370.50s -> 19372.50s]  there are some moments in this game that can be but
[19373.70s -> 19379.06s]  it's fun sometimes to sit there for five to eight hours and mine stones and just chat and hang out and
[19380.58s -> 19382.79s]  You know what I mean?
[19382.79s -> 19389.32s]  It's a great game for that
[19389.32s -> 19392.12s]  But thank you the whole keg for the five dollars
[19394.72s -> 19398.24s]  Hey another huge thank you to all the gifted community subs
[19400.20s -> 19402.76s]  tora t comes to mind here with
[19403.38s -> 19406.02s]  50
[19406.02s -> 19407.54s]  right here
[19407.54s -> 19409.14s]  That's so much
[19409.14s -> 19411.38s]  That's a lot of subs to give in one second
[19412.10s -> 19417.92s]  And I think there was even more after that too
[19420.00s -> 19423.43s]  my god
[19423.43s -> 19428.79s]  So many community subs and then 420 squid. Thanks for the one dollar. Spyro music is the key to subs
[19431.57s -> 19434.77s]  I did play the Spyro 2 ost at least a portion of it
[19436.13s -> 19437.97s]  But thank you
[19437.97s -> 19441.57s]  Thank you the yellowest for the one dollar can't stay around but i'll see you in the vod boy
[19442.37s -> 19445.01s]  Always remember your time and effort are appreciated here
[19448.24s -> 19449.28s]  Thank you
[19449.28s -> 19454.44s]  Hopefully if you catch this or if you see the new year's eve stream, hopefully we catch you there
[19454.44s -> 19456.44s]  That should be a really really fun night
[19457.00s -> 19459.08s]  Even that stream is probably only going to be a few hours
[19459.80s -> 19462.80s]  I'll probably do like a pre-stream thing maybe before
[19464.00s -> 19467.48s]  But it'll be like a little three hour event
[19468.44s -> 19471.96s]  And it should be a lot of fun
[19476.26s -> 19482.18s]  Thank you to smelly boy for the one dollar save before risky decisions. I did I did I've saved quick saved like a thousand times
[19484.58s -> 19488.58s]  420 squared. Thanks for the four dollars call of duty round start compilation
[19490.74s -> 19501.86s]  What call of duty round start compilation? I don't know what that means
[19503.51s -> 19505.51s]  Is that am I missing something?
[19514.98s -> 19519.69s]  He doesn't get it call of duty round start compilation
[19520.41s -> 19530.82s]  Can fail, I don't know. Oh, thank you for the four dollars 420 squid

[19587.38s -> 19590.26s]  Look closely. Is it garfield or no focus now?
[19591.22s -> 19593.22s]  There's no there's no garfield on the screen

[19629.86s -> 19635.38s]  Happy birthday. I'm sorry for your loss. That's terrible
[19644.57s -> 19646.17s]  Thanks for hanging out
[19646.17s -> 19648.17s]  Hopefully you feel better. It's tough
[19649.11s -> 19650.87s]  Much love to you. Thank you
[19650.87s -> 19662.28s]  Happy birthday magical rodent sir feline. Thanks for the one dollar. Why wasn't the rat song?
[19663.00s -> 19665.00s]  Even considered during the music part
[19665.56s -> 19671.64s]  This is an outrage
[19671.64s -> 19682.02s]  Um, what do you mean for the osts? It's like one song
[19682.82s -> 19685.38s]  It'd be on repeat
[19685.38s -> 19694.17s]  Well, that's the point
[19694.17s -> 19696.63s]  Oh, I see
[19696.63s -> 19699.35s]  Uh, hey g flota. Thanks for the five dollars
[19699.91s -> 19705.27s]  Hey, could you put on the kenshi ost? I got a feeling you'd like it. The game's ambience is similar to this one's thanks
[19705.75s -> 19715.50s]  It would be fun if I did that. Uh, thank you garon ninja for the one dollar germa heart. Thank you
[19719.75s -> 19722.95s]  Thank you nipple for the one dollar. Yo, yo, it's my guy
[19724.47s -> 19725.91s]  Thank you nipple
[19725.91s -> 19729.37s]  You have the second part of your name, but
[19730.30s -> 19734.78s]  Thank you for the dollar c4g. Thanks for the one dollar
[19735.42s -> 19737.42s]  Uh, they just say bisexual pride
[19737.98s -> 19741.26s]  Thanks for the one dollar
[19741.26s -> 19751.24s]  Let's see, you know, let's see it in the chat right now
[19754.74s -> 19756.74s]  Thank you so much
[19760.78s -> 19766.94s]  Captain worgen. Thanks for the one dollar follow your dreams germa. Don't cave into peer pressure like all the other kids on the playground
[19767.74s -> 19769.10s]  Well, it's hard
[19769.10s -> 19771.42s]  When you're one kid on the playground and there are
[19772.68s -> 19775.74s]  5,000 other kids on the playground all throwing rocks at you
[19779.08s -> 19789.45s]  Right, you know, I mean when there are 5 000 kids on the playground all screaming at the same time
[19797.62s -> 19800.18s]  Comment on the right side of your screen equals
[19800.98s -> 19805.75s]  rock
[19805.75s -> 19815.59s]  Yeah, that was that was way overkill. Huh? That was way overblown. That's not even close
[19825.80s -> 19829.32s]  That was great, but what was that person's name? Oh, that was good
[19830.44s -> 19833.67s]  Remember that person
[19833.67s -> 19835.58s]  But yeah
[19835.58s -> 19845.37s]  Thank you. Thank you captain worgen. Thank you dark star 700,000 games the one dollar. Hey, man
[19846.09s -> 19848.65s]  I want to say sorry about my bits message yesterday at the time
[19848.65s -> 19852.25s]  I thought this was this game was just some poorly made piece of junk
[19852.81s -> 19857.61s]  That vinnie would play on a sunday trash stream, but I am actually quite enjoying this game now
[19859.51s -> 19861.51s]  Sometimes you got to give them a chance
[19863.69s -> 19866.57s]  You'll know if I think a game is just not worth playing. You'll know it
[19867.37s -> 19871.05s]  We've started and stopped
[19871.05s -> 19873.05s]  to shit terrible games
[19873.61s -> 19877.35s]  In three hours before
[19877.35s -> 19880.07s]  I think there's something here. I think there's something fun here
[19883.86s -> 19885.22s]  and I
[19885.22s -> 19887.06s]  I think we're close
[19887.06s -> 19888.58s]  to seeing it
[19888.58s -> 19892.42s]  It's already been very interesting and very fun so far just weird and
[19893.14s -> 19895.58s]  elaborate things happening
[19896.30s -> 19898.73s]  But you can build whole towns
[19898.97s -> 19902.04s]  This whole area is a map that have not been seen
[19903.40s -> 19911.21s]  It seems really interesting and
[19912.02s -> 19914.23s]  For the price that it is
[19914.23s -> 19916.23s]  I can't really complain, you know
[19916.47s -> 19920.28s]  this is not
[19920.28s -> 19922.28s]  a 60 game
[19923.91s -> 19926.79s]  Currently it is I believe it was a 20 30 bucks
[19927.75s -> 19929.75s]  It's 29.99 for this game
[19935.13s -> 19938.07s]  So it's kind of like
[19938.95s -> 19942.66s]  It's a little rough around the edges, right? It is
[19943.38s -> 19945.38s]  But I think that adds something to it
[19946.02s -> 19954.14s]  Derma is like 10% of the game at the moment in the newbie town
[19955.37s -> 19957.37s]  Yeah
[19957.93s -> 19962.81s]  I'd buy it if it was 30. It is 30. It's 29.99
[19971.59s -> 19973.59s]  One cent off
[19975.10s -> 19977.58s]  It has to be exactly 30 or I don't want it
[19978.38s -> 19980.38s]  Oh, well, sorry
[19985.88s -> 19988.28s]  But it's it's like whatever you want to make it if you can
[19988.84s -> 19991.88s]  If you want to like role play as certain characters if you wanted to make
[19992.36s -> 19995.48s]  There's a bunch of starting characters. You can just pick from and screw around with
[19996.92s -> 20001.72s]  If you talk like pound for pound just how much time we'll just look at the time i've spent in the game so far
[20003.29s -> 20005.21s]  I have what?
[20005.21s -> 20007.85s]  15 hours in the game 14 hours in the game something like that
[20009.85s -> 20011.13s]  and
[20011.13s -> 20015.61s]  Some games guys that are 60 dollars. I spend four hours in and I go this was terrible
[20016.17s -> 20018.17s]  Or uh, this was all right
[20018.81s -> 20029.10s]  so
[20029.10s -> 20032.55s]  I mean, but it you know games like this are not really for everybody
[20033.27s -> 20037.74s]  Because they kind of just don't you don't get to do anything really at the start
[20038.62s -> 20040.70s]  the whole point of this entire game is
[20041.82s -> 20044.54s]  You have to start from nothing. You're gonna lose every fight
[20045.34s -> 20047.34s]  And it's a little rough
[20047.50s -> 20049.50s]  around the edges, it's a little
[20049.90s -> 20051.98s]  wonky, but
[20051.98s -> 20054.22s]  You just have to play it and just see how far you get
[20055.02s -> 20057.96s]  Oh, you're very forced into mining
[20060.18s -> 20063.70s]  maybe you are but
[20063.70s -> 20072.65s]  You know, i'll look into it. You're right the evil within two if I could put a worst game of 2018 up there
[20072.97s -> 20074.97s]  When did evil within two come out?
[20077.24s -> 20080.38s]  That came out this year, didn't it?
[20080.38s -> 20081.85s]  damn it
[20081.85s -> 20083.85s]  I would have just given it to
[20084.70s -> 20086.94s]  Evil within two if it was 2018
[20087.58s -> 20091.51s]  And it goes last year
[20091.51s -> 20094.79s]  I wouldn't even have like a category of nomination. I would just give worst game of the year to it
[20095.43s -> 20102.04s]  Are you gonna tell me that you thought that game was worse than the quiet man? Yes
[20102.84s -> 20106.87s]  because the quiet man was made on probably like a
[20107.83s -> 20113.19s]  Four million dollar budget and evil within two was probably like 60 to 150 million dollars
[20113.99s -> 20126.58s]  That's so much
[20128.42s -> 20131.70s]  You may give up numbers out of bias i'm just kidding
[20132.74s -> 20136.17s]  The evil within two was an awful game
[20137.82s -> 20143.26s]  It was the worst game to come out in the last 50 years and i'm talking i'm talking when the tron video game came
[20143.26s -> 20145.26s]  out for regular nintendo
[20146.02s -> 20148.02s]  That's how far back you have to go
[20148.26s -> 20160.68s]  I respect i'm fucking around guys
[20163.82s -> 20168.70s]  I'm actually just kidding around. Don't worry. Nobody go but well, i've really liked evil within two. Why is he doing this?
[20171.54s -> 20181.21s]  Just kidding. It's a joke. He did truly hate the game though. No, it was a 2017 wasn't even the same year
[20181.21s -> 20183.21s]  It doesn't even count anymore
[20189.53s -> 20190.81s]  anyways
[20190.89s -> 20196.49s]  Uh, yes, kenshi is I would give it. Yes, I don't give like letter grades. I don't say well, that's like a no
[20196.57s -> 20198.09s]  Just there's a stamp
[20198.09s -> 20200.25s]  It's worth playing it is it is worth
[20201.03s -> 20203.53s]  Purchasing you could probably have some fun in it
[20204.49s -> 20206.49s]  That's kind of how I judge any game. I play
[20206.81s -> 20210.57s]  Hey flim flam. Thanks for the ten dollars worth every cat. Thanks for ten bucks
[20211.45s -> 20223.40s]  Worth every cat. Thank you so much for the ten dollars blim flam. Thank you
[20224.12s -> 20228.84s]  To neon five eight twelve for the one dollar category worst german nine eight five creations
[20229.56s -> 20233.61s]  I mean the thing that that's worst new character. I think
[20234.33s -> 20237.66s]  Pits in that category
[20237.66s -> 20239.66s]  You give letter grades all the time
[20241.00s -> 20244.04s]  Back up us back in like 2017. I did that we're talking about 2018
[20244.76s -> 20248.39s]  Which is a different year
[20248.39s -> 20251.27s]  Uh neon again, thanks with three dollars have the wasps returned
[20251.99s -> 20257.54s]  What's that buzzing?
[20257.54s -> 20259.54s]  Is the bird house a character?
[20259.86s -> 20264.26s]  No, the bird house would be that would be classified as a stream
[20265.06s -> 20272.47s]  Right. That's an overall stream
[20272.47s -> 20274.47s]  Why are they more worse than bests?
[20275.40s -> 20278.20s]  That's I guess kind of the point of the whole stream
[20287.11s -> 20288.55s]  Thank you neon
[20288.55s -> 20292.87s]  Hey dark star. Thanks again for the dollar amen. He's doing the end of p voice germa pluto

[20307.50s -> 20309.50s]  This was two hours ago. I don't know what I did
[20310.06s -> 20315.90s]  But uh, even the best baseball players in the world that have ever lived, uh still

[20345.11s -> 20348.28s]  I don't think there are very many of those this year
[20360.57s -> 20364.97s]  It happens often, but I don't know if that happened if there's any been really crazy ones a couple of years ago
[20365.69s -> 20370.73s]  Back when I didn't understand how to properly configure obs and stream decks and stuff
[20370.81s -> 20373.85s]  Maybe happened a lot more frequently. Sometimes I still can't catch it
[20375.30s -> 20378.34s]  But no, this is the list that's 20 categories
[20379.06s -> 20381.06s]  That'll take us a few hours to get through

[20466.64s -> 20469.36s]  Stream where we played like three or four of them
[20470.24s -> 20474.76s]  There hasn't been very many there would only be about three nominees anyways

[20528.27s -> 20530.75s]  All these pornographic pieces of material
[20533.24s -> 20537.08s]  I je why do you need to do that? It's not it's it's unnecessary

[21082.62s -> 21084.38s]  Thank you so much everybody
[21084.38s -> 21087.58s]  While these go up the screen in a weird
[21088.30s -> 21089.58s]  fashion
[21089.58s -> 21093.04s]  I want to break down one more time
[21094.59s -> 21096.59s]  It was not a gnome. It was this
[21101.84s -> 21104.14s]  Uh, let me break down one more time

[21114.91s -> 21116.91s]  I will not be live until then
[21117.88s -> 21119.96s]  So take the opportunity to figure out
[21120.44s -> 21122.20s]  From the categories on here
[21122.20s -> 21125.48s]  You get to pick one nomination per category per person
[21126.20s -> 21130.28s]  So that means you could put up to 20 but it has to be on one category
[21130.92s -> 21133.80s]  You can't just put you know, 20 different worst
[21134.36s -> 21138.12s]  Gamer moments you can pick one but you can do it for all of them
[21143.53s -> 21145.93s]  These nominations will be picked by me
[21146.89s -> 21148.89s]  And a handful of the mods
[21151.28s -> 21152.88s]  a day from now
[21152.88s -> 21155.05s]  Pretty much one day from now
[21156.30s -> 21161.26s]  Maybe even tomorrow afternoon there's going to be another link there that will be a poll to vote
[21164.89s -> 21172.54s]  For the winners of those categories which will then be put into an envelope and opened on stream
[21173.02s -> 21180.20s]  The poll is not there yet. We need to have the nominations first
[21182.86s -> 21186.94s]  You'll see the disc it'll be in a discord. There'll be just just jump in the discord over the next
[21187.50s -> 21190.70s]  24 hours or so. You'll see it. You're just gonna have to click a link
[21191.42s -> 21197.72s]  The link will be in the discord. It will take you to a survey which you will take it'll be
[21198.44s -> 21210.88s]  Every nominee you just got to vote for them get someone else to make the envelope. So you're surprised
[21211.69s -> 21213.69s]  Um, that's probably what i'll do
[21217.92s -> 21221.60s]  Look at all these subs look at all these subs coming in right now. That's insane
[21225.98s -> 21228.19s]  So i'll see you on new year's eve

[21265.48s -> 21268.52s]  Thank you everybody so much. I hope you're enjoying the kenshi streams
[21269.24s -> 21273.07s]  They're a little bit more relaxed and just chilled than some of the other ones

[21281.18s -> 21283.18s]  My god, look at this. Something else is playing
