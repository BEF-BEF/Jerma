[0.31s -> 13.28s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Hitman Absolution.
[13.52s -> 17.64s]  Well, not really Hitman Absolution. Hitman Absolution does not come out for another couple weeks,
[17.84s -> 24.66s]  but this is the pre-order mission you get if you pre-order the game. So I guess this is a sniper challenge.
[24.66s -> 26.90s]  I have to kill this guy right here and...
[27.50s -> 30.83s]  Should I just shoot him right now?
[30.83s -> 37.79s]  Oh my god!
[37.79s -> 39.79s]  Dude, did I just beat the mission immediately?
[39.79s -> 42.92s]  Oh my god!
[42.92s -> 46.16s]  I'm just going absolutely crazy. I haven't even introduced the video.
[46.16s -> 49.16s]  I haven't even introduced the video and I killed the guy.
[49.16s -> 51.85s]  Dude, why did I do that?
[51.85s -> 55.31s]  Oh my word, should I not have done that?
[55.31s -> 57.31s]  Let's see if I can even complete this.
[57.31s -> 60.80s]  Dude, I blew that guy's brains out.
[60.80s -> 64.07s]  Oh, get smashed.
[64.07s -> 67.33s]  All these people freaking out.
[67.33s -> 71.70s]  Look, it's like somebody dropped a grenade at the party. Everyone's like running around.
[71.70s -> 73.70s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. God evacuated. I gotta find any of the gods.
[73.70s -> 78.07s]  Alright, well anyways, I'm really excited for Hitman Absolution.
[78.07s -> 80.07s]  If you can tell.
[80.07s -> 82.31s]  And...
[82.31s -> 88.44s]  Damn it.
[88.44s -> 90.44s]  Let's just not shoot into the crowd.
[93.76s -> 95.76s]  Oh, wait.
[95.76s -> 97.76s]  There he is right there.
[97.76s -> 101.46s]  Oh, come on.
[101.46s -> 103.89s]  You bastard.
[103.89s -> 106.45s]  Oh, he's not getting in that helicopter.
[106.45s -> 108.45s]  I will make sure he does not get in that helicopter.
[108.45s -> 110.45s]  I will put a bullet in between his eyes.
[110.45s -> 112.69s]  Just like this guy right here.
[112.69s -> 114.69s]  Slow time down and...
[114.69s -> 117.57s]  No, I missed.
[117.57s -> 119.88s]  Oh, that's a times two baby.
[119.88s -> 122.50s]  Wait, wait, wait. Where is he?
[122.50s -> 125.51s]  There he is, there he is. Look at this guy.
[125.51s -> 127.51s]  Please don't kill me.
[127.51s -> 131.51s]  Please don't kill me.
[131.51s -> 133.68s]  No, he's gonna get away.
[133.68s -> 136.31s]  He's gonna get away.
[136.31s -> 139.89s]  No, I gotta do the last ditch effort.
[139.89s -> 141.89s]  No, no, we evacuated.
[141.89s -> 143.89s]  Alright, let's try this again.
[143.89s -> 148.10s]  Right in his face.
[148.10s -> 151.41s]  Right in his face.
[151.41s -> 153.41s]  This next guy is gonna be second in line to die.
[153.41s -> 157.25s]  Get him right in his shoulder blade.
[157.25s -> 159.81s]  Oh, somebody saw that.
[159.81s -> 162.69s]  I gotta be careful here.
[162.69s -> 165.76s]  Let me reload this damn thing.
[165.76s -> 169.78s]  Let's go 47. Get your game on.
[169.78s -> 171.78s]  This guy down here. I don't wanna hit the window.
[171.78s -> 177.14s]  What? What?
[177.14s -> 181.88s]  Hey, what happened to the window behind me?
[181.88s -> 184.12s]  It just like exploded.
[184.12s -> 188.53s]  Hey, did I insta-die?
[188.53s -> 191.60s]  I think I should be in the clear though.
[191.60s -> 193.60s]  Now I'm gonna take my time here.
[193.60s -> 195.60s]  Because every time I kill somebody, like this guy over here,
[195.60s -> 198.40s]  everybody freaks out.
[198.40s -> 201.03s]  Is there somebody like on the roof? Oh, there is.
[201.03s -> 206.08s]  Is this a bodyguard?
[206.08s -> 208.39s]  What was that guy doing?
[208.39s -> 210.39s]  That guy was putting his hands on his waist like
[210.39s -> 212.95s]  I am a superhero.
[212.95s -> 215.38s]  You got killed, man.
[215.38s -> 220.79s]  Is there like a, what?
[220.79s -> 222.79s]  Is that a bodyguard up there?
[222.79s -> 228.79s]  Are you serious?
[228.79s -> 232.37s]  What? How am I supposed to hit this guy?
[232.37s -> 238.84s]  Oh, this guy.
[238.84s -> 243.57s]  That's a long fall.
[243.57s -> 246.96s]  That's a long fall. He's still going.
[246.96s -> 249.52s]  Imagine looking over and seeing that.
[249.52s -> 252.40s]  Okay.
[252.40s -> 255.09s]  Wow, that took like 15 seconds
[255.09s -> 257.09s]  for that bullet to hit that guy.
[257.09s -> 260.10s]  I only got 12 minutes here.
[260.10s -> 263.17s]  I gotta be sly.
[263.17s -> 266.37s]  Anybody else out here? Is anybody gonna see me shoot this guy?
[266.37s -> 268.87s]  I'm going for this guy right now.
[268.87s -> 271.92s]  Right in his chest.
[271.92s -> 273.92s]  Load, reload.
[273.92s -> 278.28s]  Exposed? What do you mean exposed?
[278.28s -> 282.95s]  I gotta kill this guy right here.
[282.95s -> 284.95s]  I'm gonna be such a bad shot though.
[284.95s -> 289.62s]  Oh, bang.
[289.62s -> 295.06s]  I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[295.06s -> 297.43s]  How did I get exposed?
[297.43s -> 299.43s]  Who is it?
[299.43s -> 301.43s]  Who's placing a phone call?
[301.43s -> 304.05s]  Oh, this guy right here is like looking for me.
[304.05s -> 306.05s]  Get shot in the face, dude.
[306.05s -> 310.02s]  What, what, what, what, what, what, what is he,
[310.02s -> 313.41s]  where's he making the phone call?
[313.41s -> 315.41s]  Hey, you're not gonna find me. Where is that guy shooting?
[315.41s -> 317.41s]  Hey, bro, I'm over here to your right.
[317.41s -> 321.70s]  I'm not like over there, like over this way.
[321.70s -> 323.70s]  Oh, there he is. Oh, he's about to make the phone call
[323.70s -> 325.94s]  aka run. Oh, he's gonna get
[325.94s -> 327.94s]  smashed.
[327.94s -> 330.18s]  Right in his side.
[330.18s -> 333.70s]  You're dead, man.
[333.70s -> 338.42s]  Oh, hold on, I gotta get this guy. Boink.
[338.42s -> 340.42s]  Man, getting headshots. You gotta have some skill shots
[340.42s -> 342.72s]  to hit fellas. Oh, there goes the whole
[342.72s -> 345.60s]  party. At least I killed the target.
[345.60s -> 350.02s]  Right in his back. Moving kill streak.
[350.02s -> 353.28s]  Nice. Oh, let me get them all.
[353.28s -> 355.28s]  See ya. Right in your glasses.
[355.28s -> 357.59s]  Oh, brutal.
[357.59s -> 361.68s]  Oh, guard evacuated. What? Where's there another guard?
[361.68s -> 364.74s]  Down here? I only have three more left.
[364.74s -> 368.13s]  I don't know where any of them are.
[368.13s -> 371.08s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Right in his forehead.
[371.08s -> 374.13s]  Go ahead. See ya. See ya.
[374.13s -> 378.21s]  Any more? Any more?

[382.21s -> 385.41s]  Oh, boy.
[385.41s -> 389.94s]  No, those are bartenders.
[389.94s -> 393.01s]  There's only one guard left. Where the hell is he?
[393.01s -> 395.01s]  Oh, I can hold.
[395.01s -> 397.01s]  I can use like instinct. I have like

[424.04s -> 426.66s]  I got, oh, I unlocked something
[426.66s -> 428.66s]  for Hitman Absolution. Increased the
[428.66s -> 430.96s]  stability on sniper rifles. Oh, that's
[430.96s -> 433.84s]  gonna be a good thing to have.
[433.84s -> 435.84s]  But yeah, thanks so much for watching guys.
[435.84s -> 437.84s]  Really do appreciate it. I am so excited
[437.84s -> 439.84s]  for Hitman Absolution, which
[439.84s -> 441.84s]  launches in less than two weeks. It's gonna be
[441.84s -> 443.84s]  so much fun. You're gonna see a lot of content of that game
[443.84s -> 445.84s]  on this channel. So stay tuned for
[445.84s -> 447.84s]  that, guys. And again, if you pre-order
[447.84s -> 449.84s]  Hitman. I know this is somewhat old
[449.84s -> 451.84s]  content. It came out a while back.
[451.84s -> 453.84s]  But if you pre-order Hitman right now, you're gonna be able to get
[453.84s -> 455.84s]  this and have some fun with it.
[455.84s -> 457.84s]  So I'll see you guys all next time. And of course,
[457.84s -> 459.84s]  take care, everybody.
