[1.34s -> 16.31s]  Hi. Well, how do you do? More gold, Your Majesty. Hey, that's exactly the game we're playing tonight.
[17.37s -> 24.52s]  Welcome, everybody. Hope you've had a swell few days. I've had an interesting few days. It's been
[24.52s -> 35.08s]  very, very fun. Very, very interesting stuff going on. What happened to GTA? I want to play GTA online
[35.08s -> 41.14s]  with people, like others, like do like a streamer, a streamer night. I'm trying to find people that
[41.14s -> 47.30s]  would want to do it because I think it's fun when you bring in like four, like three to four
[48.76s -> 61.67s]  GTA friends to do it together. So I want to, I want to do it with people, 30 to 50 GTA friends.
[62.39s -> 73.16s]  But anyways, this is a requested game and it's a game that I got very interested in
[74.14s -> 80.92s]  because it's a game it's called Majesty for it's an old one. And in this game, it's kind of in the
[80.92s -> 86.92s]  RTS strategy game style, but there's one, one, one very large difference. In this game,
[87.56s -> 95.00s]  you do not have any control over anyone in the game. You build your castle, your kingdom,
[96.04s -> 109.19s]  and you don't get to determine what the fuck happens. Is it an anime? No, no,
[111.18s -> 117.83s]  it's not. But thank you lunch meat for the five community subs right off the bat. Thanks lunch
[117.83s -> 126.79s]  meat. And then phylactery lich gave 50 bucks. Both you guys, I haven't even done anything.
[126.79s -> 132.12s]  And look at this. It's already here. This shitload of money. Thank you for the $50 phylactery lich.
[132.12s -> 139.75s]  Don't you ever leave us again, Jeremy. We need you. You don't need me. It's been inside of you
[139.75s -> 153.30s]  the whole time. You don't need me. It's a Star Wars thing, right? Who said that? Yoda? I'm the
[153.30s -> 158.98s]  only Majesty streamer in the history of Twitch. I don't believe that at all. But let me just make
[158.98s -> 201.30s]  a tweet and we'll get started. Give me one sec. Okay. All right. So this is the HD version.
[201.30s -> 204.74s]  Hopefully there's nothing I need to do for this version. I don't think there is.
[211.35s -> 217.83s]  The thing that I have a problem with in these old games, when they do an HD remaster, they usually
[217.83s -> 225.53s]  just make you hold the binoculars the other way around. And look at the game. It ends up being in
[225.53s -> 232.44s]  this tiny little square. And it like everything's so small. It's like looking at the back of a
[232.44s -> 236.97s]  cereal box. You guys know what I'm talking about? When I say that, you know, when there's a game on
[236.97s -> 242.95s]  the back of a cereal box, it's an elaborate bunch of shit that they stuff on there. And it's so small,
[242.95s -> 249.32s]  but they had to put as much on there as possible. That's how I feel when they remaster old games.
[249.96s -> 262.15s]  We'll see if that's the case. There it is. Let's get the audio on. It's got a nice little little
[262.15s -> 275.64s]  jingle. What's my favorite? What's my favorite egg flavor? There you go. Here's your cereal box.
[276.28s -> 281.34s]  This is the back of the Fruit Loops box. No, it's not good. That's not going to be it. This is going
[281.34s -> 290.14s]  to be bigger. It's going to blow up a little. That's my favorite egg flavor. Yeah. Yeah. Egg.
[290.14s -> 297.67s]  What are you talking about? All right. Play game. Please enter your name, your majesty.
[297.67s -> 302.14s]  Um, you're going to have something interesting, right? Am I a king yet?
[303.02s -> 313.90s]  Well, the crown implies yes. Uh, how about, no, not Jax. Not every character has to be Jax.
[314.70s -> 323.94s]  How about, um, I mean, like, that's the person that just gave five community subs. We're going
[323.94s -> 335.77s]  to have to thank him. Thank you, King Ryan Goodstream. Thanks for the five subs. Uh,
[335.77s -> 341.05s]  I'm going to see this for the remainder of this whole game. So we're going to have to, uh,
[341.85s -> 346.92s]  sounds like an old name. No, I don't want to do one of those old jokey names like
[347.56s -> 367.88s]  this. No, no, no, no, no. It's something easy. No, I don't want to write like an actual Senator's
[367.88s -> 391.70s]  name here. Uh, King Senator. King Senator Jeremy. I kind of like that. That looks good.
[393.56s -> 402.89s]  King Senator Jeremy. Your Excellency, I offer my most humble introduction.
[403.53s -> 409.21s]  I am Lord Van Fairweather. I was your mother's most trusted advisor. Why is his pitch going
[409.21s -> 416.58s]  higher? I submit my services to you in that continued capacity. That was like, it's me.
[417.70s -> 422.18s]  It's me Cornelius Bartlebus. I forget the name already, but what happened is my voice got pitched
[422.18s -> 426.98s]  up as I was going through that. I forgot his name already. I'll play the epic quest, the bell, the
[426.98s -> 433.37s]  book, and the candle to get an introduction to the game. There's three different actors.
[434.33s -> 438.73s]  Okay. The bell, the book, and the candle. And they are doing the fucking cereal box
[438.73s -> 444.89s]  bullshit. This is the back of the cereal box. Turn, go, go, go right now. Go get a box of cocoa
[444.89s -> 449.61s]  puffs right now and take a look at the back. They have like, oh, over here is like the fun dome of
[449.61s -> 459.08s]  interaction. This is like two word games over here. Oh, can you find the, the, the four, two can't sams?
[461.00s -> 473.38s]  I've seen this before. This is a secret quest. What was the bell, the book, where the fuck is it?
[473.38s -> 481.22s]  This is, it's okay. Am I stupid? It's, this is its own game. The bell, the book in the, this one?
[482.87s -> 498.17s]  Find all the hidden objects. It's the spider. The spider down here. I found tree. The forsaken land,
[498.17s -> 508.71s]  the barren waste. Quest for the crown. Rescue the prince. The bell, the book. Where the fuck is this?
[509.59s -> 523.43s]  This is huge. That was it? Quest for the crown, the forsaken land, the barren waste. Secret
[523.43s -> 532.55s]  quest. Is this the crown, the quest for the crown? Quest for the chalice? Is it this one? You just
[532.55s -> 551.40s]  read it. No, no, no. I said what I was looking for. The bell, the book, and the candle. Okay, there it
[551.40s -> 558.60s]  is. Forgive the intrusion, highness, but we've been robbed. Someone has stolen the magic bell,
[558.60s -> 563.80s]  the holy book, and the eternal candle. Right from under our noses, they were whisked away from the
[563.80s -> 568.52s]  royal treasury by some scoundrel. We must do something to recover them. They are treasures
[568.52s -> 575.00s]  beyond value. Okay, so we've been robbed. Somebody stole the book, somebody stole the bell,
[575.00s -> 582.02s]  somebody stole the candle. Let's go. Goals. Recover the three items which have been stolen from your
[582.02s -> 586.90s]  palace and hidden in the lairs throughout this realm. No warriors or wizards available in this
[586.90s -> 603.06s]  quest. Remember, I can't control anybody. What the hell am I supposed to do? All right, so here's our
[604.70s -> 614.71s]  city guard one. This is the buildings. Blacksmith gnome hubble. Where's the vehicle depot?
[618.42s -> 620.26s]  Wait, what? What's going on? Is this a spider?
[627.11s -> 630.71s]  Okay, there are rumors that thieves who stole the artifact from your treasury have fled,
[631.51s -> 636.63s]  but were forced to hide the artifacts as they left. Find the items before the thieves have a
[636.63s -> 643.11s]  chance to return. Okay, so find the artifacts before the thieves have a chance to return.
[643.83s -> 652.06s]  What's going on over here? Guard house? The need and haggis.
[656.62s -> 673.06s]  Heroes. Okay, so blacksmith rogue's guild. Didn't it say that it was going to teach me how to play
[673.06s -> 682.62s]  the game? Am I like mistaken or was that like, hey click on this one if you want to learn? There we
[682.62s -> 687.64s]  go. All right, heroes visit the blacksmith in order to purchase better weapons and armor.
[687.72s -> 691.72s]  Once you have researched those skills, upgrade your blacksmith and even better items will be
[691.72s -> 696.76s]  available for you to research. Okay, heroes visit the blacksmith to purchase better weapons. So
[699.38s -> 703.54s]  once you have researched those skills. Okay, so what do I research those skills?
[704.66s -> 711.00s]  Level one. Oh, there we go. Guard house. Guard houses host a member of the city guard and can
[711.00s -> 718.90s]  fire arrows at nearby enemies. Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.
[718.90s -> 724.97s]  I'm reading. You just like dragged Ebeneezer Scrooge out of bed before he was Ebeneezer
[724.97s -> 728.65s]  Scrooge. I'm just thinking of a guy with that fucking hat on with the thing on the top.
[729.29s -> 733.45s]  And you just put me in the slot as a king. And I'm like, you know, fuck that whole reference.
[734.17s -> 738.89s]  I can fire arrows at nearby enemies once you research that skill. Use them to protect vital
[738.89s -> 742.97s]  buildings or far-flung outposts from your city. Hence men also rest at guard houses if they are
[742.97s -> 750.70s]  closer than the palace. Okay, what are we doing with these things? You'll get it next time. Yeah,
[750.70s -> 757.66s]  I was like gonna go somewhere with that. Okay, so guard houses can fire arrows at enemies. Sounds
[757.66s -> 761.74s]  good. You need to peep. Oh, you want better stuff. But why are they just random people coming over
[761.74s -> 768.87s]  here? And why is the city guard walking around? Is there no these? Is this like another NPC? Is
[768.87s -> 776.63s]  this like a person controlling this? Or are they just wandering around? All right, where's the next
[776.63s -> 782.95s]  note? Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes. I know. Inns are gathering
[782.95s -> 790.26s]  and resting places here for heroes and allow them to extend their range of their wandering.
[790.26s -> 798.22s]  If you build them outside your main city. Okay, so you want to have inns further out. It's a way
[798.22s -> 804.31s]  for you to continue to have heroes kind of come in and say hello and say what's up. I have no idea
[804.31s -> 814.63s]  what that means. I know that means something. Okay, 120 HP, coffers hold 57 gold. Oh, tax
[814.63s -> 822.47s]  collector. Henchmen, minimum minimum return. Decrease this tax collector's minimum return
[822.47s -> 829.27s]  amount. Maximum pickup. So this guy just walked around and collects taxes. Okay, cool. What's
[829.27s -> 836.31s]  down? What the hell is this? Trading posts are a place for heroes to purchase healing potions.
[837.66s -> 845.88s]  Healing potions. Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes. I know.
[846.76s -> 852.20s]  I'm gonna try. I need to, hold on. Trading posts are a place for heroes to purchase healing potions.
[852.20s -> 857.16s]  Build a marketplace near your palace and the trading post will periodically send out caravans
[857.16s -> 863.16s]  to them. Okay, so you have a marketplace near your palace. We can get caravans to them. Bringing in
[863.16s -> 869.34s]  a bunch of gold to your treasury. Forget about the random snake ladies that run around. That's
[869.34s -> 872.46s]  just a problem. They're just, they're like bugs. There'd just be much to watch out for them.
[872.54s -> 884.82s]  Okay, we need more heroes. I'm working on it. I'm waiting for the next thing to pop up. All right,
[884.82s -> 892.15s]  what, what do we got? Cast farseeing. There's no wizards allowed here, right? Palace. Who builds
[892.15s -> 899.11s]  shit? Oh, I do. Okay, buildings. Guard house in marketplace, right? Do we have one of those
[899.11s -> 905.56s]  already? Build a marketplace. Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.
[906.36s -> 910.20s]  Who builds the marketplace? Do the guards build the marketplace?
[912.47s -> 924.18s]  Peasants at work on site. How long does this take? Oh, I only have one peasant? No, we need way more
[924.18s -> 931.86s]  than that. Roster. Buildings. Henchmen. City guard. How do I get more peasants? I only have like five
[931.86s -> 949.74s]  people in my whole town. What? Somebody just like crashed. A new thing is complete. Who just crashed?
[951.64s -> 966.41s]  Okay, got my marketplace. So then that means that I can... Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper,
[966.41s -> 974.25s]  it needs more heroes. Okay, how do I prevent this from happening? Oh, the tax collector. Yeah,
[974.25s -> 995.58s]  throw the bag of money. Uh, how do you turn around? Okay, cool. Uh, something, something,
[995.82s -> 1007.66s]  your highness, something, something. I need a hero. Recruiter rogue? Why do they just stand
[1007.66s -> 1032.79s]  around over here? Don't I have a tax collector? It's me, Roger from American Dad. Uh, is this the
[1032.79s -> 1038.89s]  zombie following? All right, so we're not gonna make money. Do I not get to determine who gets
[1038.89s -> 1048.57s]  made in ranger's guild, rogue's guild, trading post? Scott the snitch. Scott the snitch is stealing.
[1050.94s -> 1064.66s]  Who the fuck is this? Kill him. Get him. He's just taking money from every building.
[1079.61s -> 1095.08s]  He's actually doing kind of good. This city sucks. All right, where's my rogue? Don't I have a rogue?
[1095.08s -> 1102.82s]  Oh, there we go. I can actually drag this around. All right, get this off. I don't know why this is
[1102.82s -> 1111.83s]  even here. Oh, there's the rogue. Scott snitches. My mission has paid off. Hold on, is Scott the snitch
[1111.83s -> 1127.08s]  killing things but helping me? Is Scott the snitch the rogue that I just hired? What? Hold on a second.
[1129.88s -> 1138.90s]  I just hired the guy and he just went off to start stealing shit. Okay, we need police. No,
[1138.90s -> 1143.64s]  sorry, the police are currently dealing with medusas. I need a hero. I need another one of
[1143.64s -> 1149.58s]  those things to tell me what building I need to make. Guard house? No, I don't have any heroes.
[1150.30s -> 1164.28s]  Blacksmith research. Let's see, level two weapons. I got plenty of money. Ranger's guild,
[1164.92s -> 1169.61s]  rogue's guild. All right, I'm going to build like a ranger's guild over here.
[1169.61s -> 1174.97s]  Majesty, the local blacksmith offers new services. Yes, I just did that.
[1174.97s -> 1194.17s]  How do I get that off? So are you a hero? Peasant one. Majesty, the local blacksmith offers new
[1194.17s -> 1198.57s]  services. Scott the snitch. Yeah, this is this dickhead is the one that... Okay, so how do I
[1198.57s -> 1207.29s]  tell him to go? Oh, we need more. We need more. Let's get some more. He's a peasant right there.
[1207.29s -> 1217.14s]  Let's build another ranger's guild. Okay, this is a message to Mr. Titegold. I'm out of here.
[1217.14s -> 1224.90s]  Kill this thing. Did he just win it? There are monsters attacking the kingdom right now.
[1225.46s -> 1230.42s]  Killing peasants. There we go. Nice job. Dave the screamer. All right, I like Dave the screamer.
[1230.42s -> 1235.72s]  Your majesty, our new building is complete. Spells stats. All right.
[1237.56s -> 1247.51s]  All right, there's the ranger's guild. Arranger. Let's get a ranger here. How do I get them to do
[1247.51s -> 1252.07s]  anything? Like go explore. I guess I have to build the buildings and see what happens.
[1260.55s -> 1282.92s]  Use the flags. I don't even know what that means. Use the flags. Use the lid. This is supposed to
[1282.92s -> 1289.27s]  be the tutorial and all they've said was, welcome, you need a hero. What the hell? Okay, good. Get
[1289.27s -> 1302.07s]  up there. Let's do what we got. It's you up there. So I can keep them in little windows here. Let's
[1302.07s -> 1315.66s]  get another one. If you double click monsters, you get a bounty flag. Okay. All right, Scott
[1315.66s -> 1331.99s]  the snitch is doing a pretty good job over here. Is it attacking the caravan? Finally. I killed
[1331.99s -> 1347.34s]  something. Kill it. Thank you. $350. All right, deposit that. Are you exploring over here? Oh,
[1347.34s -> 1355.86s]  you're doing a good job. Kill it. Nice. I feel like I'm just looking at a top down view of World
[1355.86s -> 1365.82s]  of Warcraft. I'm just looking at Goldshire right now from a top down view. That's my fourth tax
[1365.82s -> 1380.42s]  collector. How much bigger is this map to not find this stuff? Visitors. Who's even there? Okay.
[1381.46s -> 1396.55s]  Seeking. Okay. All right, so Scott the snitch. No, I don't even know what the fuck I just did.
[1397.51s -> 1402.31s]  I need like the game manual in my lap right now. Sewer entrance.
[1405.83s -> 1421.38s]  Okay, let me take a look at what this stuff even is. I don't even know. Trading posts. So let me
[1421.38s -> 1428.97s]  research something here. Healing potions. They need those. We're getting overwhelmed. I need more
[1429.05s -> 1450.62s]  heroes. Thank you. Jeeves, whatever your name is. All right, recruit a rogue. Who's in there?
[1451.26s -> 1458.31s]  Two peasants are in the guard house right now. I need to find the book. The rabbit and the
[1458.95s -> 1466.50s]  candle. Whatever the hell it is. I wish I understood what was going on here. Like,
[1466.50s -> 1473.46s]  I'm following him. If I double click on you, I can like follow two people at the same time.
[1474.42s -> 1479.05s]  All right. And then they have different things that scan through buildings, scan through henchmen,
[1479.77s -> 1492.01s]  scan through heroes. Okay, here we go. Scott the snitch. Okay, I'm gonna keep my spy camera on
[1492.01s -> 1500.87s]  Paul the explorer and Scott the snitch. You need warriors. Warriors were not allowed in this
[1501.83s -> 1503.11s]  mission, I believe.
[1509.56s -> 1523.42s]  What? Is it a rat man? What? This is the tutorial? Yeah, and it's not
[1523.42s -> 1532.14s]  tutorialing me anything. I got three notes left. Sticky notes. I haven't been tutorialized at all.
[1532.22s -> 1549.96s]  Reward attack flag. This guy's killing everybody.
[1553.94s -> 1559.78s]  Heroes are often motivated by rewards offered by the sovereign. Oh, what the fuck? It's just a
[1559.78s -> 1574.41s]  thousand dollars to kill this guy. Kill a ten thousand. Somebody will kill him. Yeah, you don't
[1574.41s -> 1583.94s]  have to worry about that. My god. All right, so where is this? Okay, I got that concept now.
[1584.66s -> 1593.00s]  You got to double click on somebody and offer an amount of money to kill it. Okay, offered by
[1593.00s -> 1599.61s]  Senator Jeremy 100 bucks. What does that mean? Offer? Okay, so if you go over here, it's money.
[1599.61s -> 1605.54s]  Okay, I get it. Would have loved to have known that like 10 minutes ago. You got to give people
[1605.54s -> 1615.43s]  incentives to explore. Okay, so I want you go over here. If you go up here, that's worth 300
[1615.43s -> 1634.87s]  bucks. No, that's worth 500 dollars. Whoever wants to explore up there. All right, so who the fuck's
[1634.87s -> 1640.44s]  going up there? Who's going to take that bounty? All you have to do is walk over here. Are you going
[1640.44s -> 1658.41s]  to take that bounty? That's easy money. I don't blame you. Okay, research these. How do I get
[1658.41s -> 1665.91s]  this? Research level two weapons for sale. I can't do that. What else can I build? What's a gnome
[1665.91s -> 1677.69s]  hover? I'm looking for three items. Let's go down. Look, somebody needs to. No one's going to claim
[1677.69s -> 1687.21s]  this for some reason. What services may help? Oh, it's marketplace rangers guild. Recruit another
[1687.21s -> 1693.93s]  ranger. Let's get like five of these guys. You going up there? Oh, you did it. You did it. You
[1693.93s -> 1699.29s]  claimed it. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. A new building is complete. Here's another 200
[1699.29s -> 1716.36s]  bucks. Just go up there and go see what's over in the top left. Recruit a gnome. Extort? What does
[1716.36s -> 1725.78s]  that mean? Collect 226 gold instantly for a cost of 100 gold. You just pull it quick. Okay.
[1726.98s -> 1745.24s]  Anybody going up here? Let's get a tavern. It's a inn, right? Yeah. There's nothing even up here.
[1745.24s -> 1748.46s]  No, I want to, I'm going to put this over here down by this way.
[1752.33s -> 1763.70s]  This is, I dig it. Okay, so I kill these things. Somebody kill it. What have I got here? Let's see.
[1764.34s -> 1769.10s]  I still don't understand how you get like shit on the main screen here. Okay.
[1772.81s -> 1775.53s]  Are they going to be okay? Can they build this down here? It's a bread and brawl.
[1778.31s -> 1784.39s]  You can put the explore flag in the fog of war. Okay, that's cool. Um, no, go get this.
[1786.23s -> 1800.46s]  Look at all this shit. Is it all taken? It's all empty. Somebody go get this. Somebody get this
[1800.46s -> 1808.44s]  fucking money right there. Get it. Open it. No, open it and run.
[1814.46s -> 1817.18s]  Nobody's there, but they go, they'll come down here. Peasant six is dead.
[1820.38s -> 1823.50s]  Big bits. Oh shit. I missed big bits like a minute ago. This guy's dead.
[1824.70s -> 1832.34s]  Sorry, Paul. I didn't want you to go hang out down here. Uh, thank you agent dark
[1833.72s -> 1838.04s]  for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits from agent dark agent dark booty.
[1838.84s -> 1842.44s]  Dermot can't tell you how much joy your streams have brought me. I have ADHD and you've honestly
[1842.44s -> 1848.22s]  been an inspiration for me. Keep up the amazing work. Thank you so much agent dark booty. Uh,
[1848.22s -> 1853.58s]  I have it too. And you're seeing in this stream right now how, how I'm dealing with it. So thank
[1853.58s -> 1865.14s]  you for the five fucking thousand bits. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Uh, he's dead. Okay,
[1865.14s -> 1876.02s]  so I need to do, uh, should I go in the sewer? Indestructible appear as your kingdom grows in
[1876.02s -> 1883.22s]  size, grants, giant rats and rat men access to your town. The wild spirit is needed for larger
[1883.22s -> 1888.90s]  towns and therefore will not be destroyed. So it just happens because we have too many, uh,
[1888.90s -> 1898.94s]  people using the suiting. Okay. I'm gonna say let's go down here. That's worth 500 bucks.
[1898.94s -> 1904.14s]  Someone to explore down that way. This person just at the front, kill, kill this fucking person,
[1904.14s -> 1911.26s]  please. Just now, right now, anybody. She's just sitting at the front door camping our like newbies
[1911.26s -> 1923.50s]  coming out. My services may help. Where are you? Somebody going down there? My services.
[1926.62s -> 1928.62s]  Why is Jeff Goldblum in our camp?
[1928.62s -> 1942.90s]  Tough fight. House one to build more houses. My services may help range skills. No,
[1942.90s -> 1946.42s]  I have everything I can do. Unless it's a, I can research something else somewhere.
[1947.46s -> 1956.25s]  He's going down and going down. We have found an abandoned keep and the missing candle. Destroy
[1956.25s -> 1960.66s]  the keep and you will recover the candle. All right. I want everybody's attention right now.
[1961.38s -> 1971.05s]  A thousand dollars to go in there and get that. No. Fuck that. It's $2,000. Oh shit. I'm getting
[1971.05s -> 1992.94s]  over there. $2,000. 3000. Where's Elbrey? What are you doing? Oh, he's, he's shooting at it.
[1994.46s -> 1997.34s]  He was like, I was like, where is he? Why is he not listening to me?
[2000.33s -> 2003.85s]  Okay. He's going to get this free grin. Okay. What happens if I click on this and I drop it
[2003.85s -> 2013.08s]  right before it dies to like a five dollar bill? Who's this? Is this a gnome? What do the gnomes do?
[2015.62s -> 2021.43s]  He's going to get it. He's the one annoying unit in command and conquer that you don't,
[2021.43s -> 2025.11s]  you're not prepared for. You don't even realize it. Anytime you played like Warcraft or command
[2025.11s -> 2031.03s]  and conquer or red alert or whatever. Once the towns got big enough, you could sneak in and just
[2031.03s -> 2035.11s]  drop one unit to attack like a farm on the outskirts and they wouldn't even know you were doing it.
[2035.11s -> 2040.15s]  And that was the best strategy. Our town is under attack. And they'll be, you have like a
[2040.15s -> 2045.94s]  fucking extra large map and you don't even know where it is. You have like five
[2045.94s -> 2048.74s]  Citadels at that point. You're just like, where the fuck is this guy attacking?
[2049.70s -> 2055.80s]  That was my strategy. Send one guy to attack the bottom of their base every single time.
[2055.80s -> 2062.68s]  All right. So I almost got this. What happened to the guy that was, he's running away. He's fleeing
[2062.68s -> 2084.44s]  in terror. Somebody will get it. All right. I need more heroes. Can I queue them up?
[2085.08s -> 2103.18s]  I need more than two. Well, they keep dying. It's impossible to make the left side bigger.
[2103.18s -> 2108.70s]  It's hard to read. Yeah. I know we've got a cereal box scenario over here on the left.
[2108.70s -> 2117.74s]  Sorry about that. Guild is full. Guild will be full here. All right. Let's take a look.
[2124.15s -> 2128.98s]  What are they doing? Will you attack the things that are outside the door?
[2129.94s -> 2143.37s]  Do you still have a $300 bounty? Somebody said, is this just constant noise or am I really high?
[2150.84s -> 2157.88s]  Kind of. All right. It's time to, okay. I've had enough of this shit.
[2162.66s -> 2168.79s]  We're making it way more expensive to kill these things. They're just running absolutely rampant
[2168.79s -> 2173.91s]  in the town. Like you have to die. Everybody focus. Whoever kills them gets $1,000.
[2175.11s -> 2193.48s]  Who's even in here? Guild is full. Get out. Are they all dead? Where are all my heroes?
[2194.28s -> 2209.18s]  Get the fuck out of here. Get out. All right. Are you guys finally going to do something?
[2213.30s -> 2218.66s]  Should have had more heroes. I apparently, who is this? Naked Shrek.
[2218.66s -> 2227.74s]  I'm going to lose in the tutorial, but look, I'm going to be really fair to myself here.
[2227.74s -> 2234.22s]  This was not, I was not tutorialized at all. It was just like here. I get overrun by snakes
[2234.22s -> 2242.47s]  and monsters. One of you guys in chat told me about this. There's so many of them down there.
[2244.47s -> 2264.90s]  Level nine is just sitting in there. Arrows, better arrows. Span guard houses to survive.
[2266.90s -> 2275.75s]  This is because there's two sewers. I don't remember this. All right. I'm going to have like six
[2275.75s -> 2287.13s]  towers. Look, it's already getting better. How much health does this have? This thing's going
[2287.13s -> 2298.95s]  down. There's one. Okay. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. Scan through buildings.
[2299.59s -> 2304.39s]  Scan through henchmen. Scan through. Okay. So this is just what the camera. Okay. So when I was
[2304.39s -> 2309.75s]  looking at this before, I thought this, I didn't know this was like scan through a building.
[2310.71s -> 2314.63s]  I thought this was commands I could try to give to this person. Okay. I get it. I understand.
[2314.63s -> 2321.35s]  I get it. Scan through reward flags. Yeah. I get it. I understand. I understand. I do. All right.
[2326.14s -> 2334.62s]  Double click to zoom to the hero. I can do this too. All right. We go. Is he going to get the
[2334.62s -> 2341.74s]  bounty? Kill this thing too. That's a thousand dollars as well guys. I have money.
[2344.14s -> 2351.42s]  There's too many houses. Why don't you build a house right here?
[2351.42s -> 2355.26s]  A new building is complete. How dumb are you? Why would this be built here?
[2356.14s -> 2361.77s]  It's right in front of the gate. This is the equivalent of having your house
[2361.77s -> 2366.89s]  directly under the airport. Like right when the planes come out. You're going to hear this like
[2366.89s -> 2371.21s]  five, 10 times a day, a hundred times a day. The bridge dropping right next to your bedroom door.
[2376.42s -> 2383.88s]  Okay. Tax collector. Is somebody going to destroy this building or what? There he is.
[2384.68s -> 2395.19s]  Sylvis Broadview is going for it. Get out of there. Get out of there. It's not worth it. Why
[2395.19s -> 2399.82s]  don't you work together and split it? You're not going to kill this thing alone. Get out.
[2403.10s -> 2414.44s]  Sylvis is berserking. Are you going to berserk right into the dirt? Wait. Maybe not. Nope. Nope.
[2416.12s -> 2424.38s]  Run away. Somebody will get this. This is almost half the money in the whole kingdom.
[2425.02s -> 2432.70s]  And you know what? Fuck that. No, that's I can't, I can't take that off. Minimum,
[2432.70s -> 2448.84s]  minimum return. Let's go with like 500 bucks. The rat man. What the fuck is happening?
[2451.32s -> 2457.72s]  We're about to get the first triforce down here. Well, now that I know what's going on,
[2458.52s -> 2466.10s]  the next thing I do will be a little bit easier. I don't really have enough money.
[2466.90s -> 2479.48s]  How do you still have a thousand dollar bounty on your head? I don't know how it's impossible.
[2483.96s -> 2494.86s]  I'm going to scan through the flags here. Attack flag. No, get rid of that. You won't get your
[2494.86s -> 2511.48s]  money back. Oh, fuck. No, nevermind. I didn't know that. Really threw a bunch of shit at me here for
[2511.48s -> 2517.08s]  teaching me how to play the game. All right. Join the explorer is going to get it. Trading post. Let's
[2517.08s -> 2535.82s]  see. He's going to get it. I think this is like a TF2 server. It kind of is. Yeah. Yeah.
[2537.66s -> 2542.76s]  It is level 11 though. Not bad. All right. What about the blacksmith?
[2542.76s -> 2548.57s]  No, no, don't attack the blacksmith. Get that off. I want to upgrade more. How do I do better
[2548.57s -> 2565.93s]  research in marketplace rangers guild? I don't think I can do anything else. You always need
[2565.93s -> 2572.66s]  at least 10 heroes. Okay. Well, I had like five here, but they died instantly when they came out.
[2573.62s -> 2580.60s]  Oh, who's going to get it? Is it going to be Feteth the Explorer? Let's see.
[2581.48s -> 2589.54s]  Medieval Lemmings. That is kind of what it's like. You're right. All right. We're good.
[2590.10s -> 2595.02s]  We have as many as we can have. This thing is still going down.
[2596.70s -> 2604.95s]  Let me see. Where's that spider? Okay. Nobody's explored down there yet somehow. Weirdly enough.
[2604.95s -> 2614.81s]  All right. Uh, everyone's okay. Kill it. Does it really take three of you? Oh, somebody got it.
[2614.81s -> 2624.23s]  Who got it? Who got it? Who did it? Pick up the candle. Pick up the candle. Heroes make use of
[2624.23s -> 2628.55s]  many magical items in their quest. Heroes will pick up any items left unattended. Are you sure
[2628.55s -> 2646.54s]  they will? Somebody get it. So many voice lines. What is this thing? Oh, Medusa. Okay. We still have
[2646.54s -> 2657.30s]  the same amount of heroes, but the roads suck. Somebody graveyard. Here we go. 14 heroes buried
[2657.30s -> 2669.30s]  here. Somebody get it. Look, do I seriously have to pay somebody to walk over here? Somebody go
[2669.30s -> 2681.32s]  over there now. Here comes the screamer. Somebody please pick this up before I lose my mind.
[2687.30s -> 2701.30s]  Why are you afraid of going over here? Get it. Get it. It's a free 600 bucks. You fucking idiot.
[2702.50s -> 2722.87s]  I guess I deserve that. I got plenty of money. I need to bring people down here
[2723.91s -> 2730.44s]  because I got this one item just sitting there. Just extort the rogue's guild.
[2733.27s -> 2738.23s]  Sorry. Uh, there's construction going on outside. I don't hear. I can't even hear what you mean by
[2738.23s -> 2750.76s]  this. Research this upgrade. Market day generates sudden revenue, but temporarily closes the
[2750.76s -> 2764.82s]  marketplace. Healing potion. Did anybody pick it up? No, of course not. Your marketplace now
[2764.82s -> 2778.94s]  serves you better. Thank you. So nobody's claimed that yet. Weirdly enough. Your marketplace now
[2778.94s -> 2788.36s]  serves you better. Uh, henchmen. No, no heroes. I want to follow who's like the level mayor,
[2788.36s -> 2793.45s]  right? My bar was my bar. There you are. All right. I want to follow you and you.
[2794.41s -> 2805.51s]  This is going to be hell going over here. Should I drop the audio? Should I make it like,
[2806.39s -> 2816.58s]  maybe is that whatever better? You know what I mean? Maybe it won't be as chaotic and horrible
[2816.58s -> 2825.59s]  sounding. That's better. It doesn't sound like four construction yards at the same time.
[2826.23s -> 2835.30s]  My ambition has paid off. It's the same. No, it's not. Kill it. Oh, tough fight.
[2836.90s -> 2843.61s]  Oh, tough fight. I can't believe no one's picked this up. I'm never going to be able to complete
[2843.61s -> 2851.56s]  the mission. Well, it's obviously not top right and obviously not top left. So it has to be like
[2851.56s -> 2860.54s]  bottom left and bottom right. Do I have to make this more expensive? 1000 bucks. All right. Come
[2860.54s -> 2878.01s]  on, Kevin. Claim it, Kevin. Come on, Kevin. No. Upgrade the buildings. I have been, haven't I?
[2879.56s -> 2890.50s]  No, I've been, I've been upgrading the building. Yeah. Wild adventure builds character. What?
[2892.86s -> 2899.02s]  Build more hunters guilds. All right. We're going to expand our influence over here.
[2899.82s -> 2928.12s]  My services may help. Wait, this is level. Click the arrow. Level. This is like a troll
[2928.12s -> 2933.48s]  walking around town. This town sucks. Why don't we have a fucking wall or a gate or something?
[2936.26s -> 2949.83s]  Why is this so normal? This should be completely abnormal. Next to the picture. Level. Okay. Level
[2949.83s -> 2962.82s]  two. I'm reading the goddamn cereal box. Oh my God. All right. Okay. All right. All right.
[2962.82s -> 2967.14s]  We're good. We're good. We're good. Everybody relax. This is, this is the tutorial we're learning.
[2968.26s -> 2974.90s]  Oh Jesus. Give me a break. I didn't even know. There was no way I was supposed to tell.
[2976.76s -> 2986.58s]  I didn't know that. I don't know. All right. Now we've got some real guards out here.
[2996.68s -> 3001.96s]  This is the 22nd tax collector. I've had a new tax collector almost each day.
[3006.15s -> 3014.06s]  All right. Who do we got? Message. Message flag. Oh, did they find it? A hero has discovered that
[3014.06s -> 3019.58s]  the book lies in this ruined altar. Raise it. Eh, okay. Raise it. No, I don't want that.
[3020.46s -> 3028.14s]  A building has been upgraded. We're going for a $2,000 bounty. Go for it. Good luck
[3028.14s -> 3037.78s]  to all of you. Can you upgrade houses? No. Okay. I thought that was a dog downstairs.
[3040.55s -> 3048.49s]  Okay. Rogues guild. Let's get some, let's get a couple more. Keep a building on fire.
[3051.82s -> 3055.66s]  Yeah. Well, what do you, what do you want me to do? I can't put it out.
[3056.54s -> 3063.38s]  I need more palace guards. Level three. You need 12 heroes to get to level three.
[3068.41s -> 3071.45s]  Blacksmith. Let's do that. Research level three weapons.
[3072.33s -> 3085.27s]  Let's take it down. We got broad view. Level 10. Three grand to get that. What happens if you
[3085.27s -> 3097.75s]  don't have enough money? What happens if I put the bounty up for? Nice. Look at this shit over here.
[3097.83s -> 3100.95s]  How the hell am I going to do that? There's too many people.
[3103.43s -> 3107.30s]  My services may help. Look up here.
[3110.20s -> 3118.65s]  My armor in the rogue. Arrows, better arrows and all these
[3119.61s -> 3130.98s]  build some more trading posts. Your highness, we've improved the god house. Your highness,
[3130.98s -> 3136.98s]  we've improved the god house. Your highness, we've improved the god house. Your highness,
[3136.98s -> 3142.90s]  we've improved the god house. Who's going to get it? The local blacksmith offers new services.
[3145.83s -> 3153.45s]  There's the holy book plus 20 intelligence. Somebody, okay, who picked up the, who picked
[3153.45s -> 3168.62s]  that up? Do I know who has that in their inventory? I serve with pleasure. Let's go. What the hell does
[3168.62s -> 3180.71s]  this shit do? Statue. What does it do though? This does. I'm gonna put it over here. I don't know
[3180.71s -> 3197.10s]  what this is. Your majesty, our new building is complete. Statues raise the loyalty of the
[3197.10s -> 3205.27s]  heroes in your kingdom. Okay. Assured that their deeds will not go unrecognized, your heroes strive
[3205.27s -> 3213.98s]  to complete their quest with room. Okay, so you need a bunch of statues. So statues make people
[3213.98s -> 3217.82s]  more happy and more willing to do what you want them to do. They'll listen to you. They'll hold
[3217.82s -> 3229.11s]  up. Let me clear that. All right, let's do what else we got. Temple of Agrilia requires no temples
[3229.11s -> 3237.48s]  to Purvis Cryptochrome. Temple of Doris. Temple of, are these like elements? Is this like water,
[3238.52s -> 3246.50s]  earth, fire, metal? I don't know. My ambition has paid off. Let's do this one.
[3248.10s -> 3264.36s]  Let's put this down here. Temple to Chrom. Not Chrom. Why? What do you mean why? What?
[3269.53s -> 3275.42s]  What's wrong with Chrom? Wait, can I not have any? I can't have any other temple. It requires it.
[3276.14s -> 3288.23s]  Give me another trading post up here. You can't build any other temples to build Chrom. Well,
[3288.23s -> 3306.07s]  whatever. That's fine. I need a garrhouse down here. This is bad. You can now not build any
[3306.07s -> 3310.15s]  temples. Yeah, well I'm almost done with the tutorial. I just have to clear the spider den.
[3311.03s -> 3325.00s]  Why would you do that? Why are you guys coming all the way down here? No, don't aggro all of
[3325.00s -> 3331.21s]  them. Don't you know that's the biggest mistake in Talked Out Goldshire? Don't do that. You're
[3331.21s -> 3337.37s]  gonna aggro everybody. Biggest mistake. Level eight. That's why you can tell. You're new to the game.
[3337.37s -> 3347.99s]  Don't do it. Oh, he's gonna do it. You did it. You fucked it all up. Sorry, you're like older
[3347.99s -> 3354.39s]  brothers not here to power word shield you to make sure that you have fun playing the game
[3354.39s -> 3360.23s]  because you're doing so terribly that your older brother knows that he has to fucking play priest
[3361.19s -> 3366.07s]  to make to and he's doing everything possible to keep you alive while you just dick around
[3366.07s -> 3375.27s]  and shoot at uh like monsters. What? I told you. I told you you got an older brother with you.
[3376.38s -> 3381.34s]  Oh shit. I don't want like I don't want Michael to die because he's fucking gonna be sad.
[3382.30s -> 3394.36s]  Power shield's on cooldown. Fuck. Just top him off. He's dead. No way you're gonna live.
[3398.55s -> 3404.47s]  He actually has it. And all the brother hanging up behind the tree over here casting like greater
[3404.47s -> 3423.62s]  heal. What about you? Do you have like a brother playing with you? What are you guys doing down
[3423.62s -> 3432.95s]  here? Oh, okay, then brothers out of mana. So comes up and tries to pull aggro. It's all right,
[3432.95s -> 3440.87s]  man. It's okay. What happened? Well, you you stood there a little too long. But it's okay. Just run
[3440.87s -> 3446.15s]  back. Do you see the mini map? I don't see the mini map. Okay, hold on. Wait, fuck. Okay, let me
[3446.15s -> 3460.01s]  move. Let me go in the other room where you are and like do it for you. There it is. The bell has
[3460.01s -> 3463.85s]  been located in this ruined shrine. Destroy this shrine and reclaim what is yours. How am I gonna

[3614.22s -> 3633.18s]  to be able to get this. I need like 100 people. Where is this guy? Oh, here we go. We've got a
[3633.18s -> 3644.38s]  bandit here. It's probably going to defuse to leave too. I hope this guy comes over and just
[3644.38s -> 3654.04s]  snipes it. Tough fight. Tough fight. Tough fight. No, they're not ready for this. I gotta pull the
[3654.04s -> 3660.60s]  bounty. Wait a minute. Come on. You can do it. Send to the barbarians. No, you're not going to.

[3673.90s -> 3695.91s]  And then I want to go to a palace guard. What? Shit. Okay. I have a level 11 in here.
[3696.79s -> 3711.46s]  Who's killing the tax collectors? Everybody. I'm going to extort this graveyard with 15 heroes
[3711.46s -> 3719.48s]  buried there. They're coming in. Here we go. This is where it's going to get interesting.

[3785.14s -> 3790.90s]  while being returned to the castle with a 15,000 gold piece reward on his head. I'm sure he'll
[3790.90s -> 3798.49s]  think long and hard before returning to our kingdom. All right, Cherik. Total gold, 55,000,
[3798.49s -> 3805.88s]  9800. Almost 985 would have been interesting. Total gold spent. Spent on research, spent on

[5590.85s -> 5598.16s]  three now. I just went out and got a shake shack burger on your recommendation. and what do you
[5598.16s -> 5606.02s]  think? pretty pretty great, right? I would say that's... I can't wait to hear your review.
[5606.82s -> 5614.56s]  this is a terrible place for that to be. all right. level three. I need 12 heroes. these guys are
[5614.56s -> 5621.94s]  all the way down here, huh? they gave me... no. I'm not gonna say that out loud because it's bullshit.
[5622.90s -> 5628.98s]  sovereign. our marketplace now serves you better. I'm gonna put another wizard's tower down here,
[5629.70s -> 5647.74s]  right? can I do that? it has to be like within the distance of this. you can go down here.
[5648.62s -> 5650.08s]  that might have been really dumb. I don't know.
[5654.93s -> 5666.45s]  quick parry. just farming levels on bears. not a big deal. has to be in range of the guild tower.
[5666.45s -> 5679.84s]  okay. so then now that this is here, I can do this, right? yeah. well, nothing over here.
[5680.40s -> 5697.36s]  nothing over here? well, let's get down to the right and enchant the tower. you can make it a
[5697.36s -> 5713.41s]  turret. oh, shit. let's go down here. 300 bucks. 400, I guess. and then like 200 bucks to go down
[5713.41s -> 5722.59s]  here. oh, that's nice. that actually works. I'm just gonna make like... okay, I gotta build something
[5722.59s -> 5727.87s]  here. I gotta have something right here. I don't know. another wizard's tower, maybe?
[5728.75s -> 5737.33s]  quick parry's level 10. yeah. he's gonna be... he's gonna carry everybody.
[5741.22s -> 5744.74s]  there goes sharp wood. where's quick parry? I want to always be following quick parry.
[5745.78s -> 5755.84s]  it's the second one. quick parry is hanging out in the inn right now. okay. just always have a
[5755.84s -> 5758.80s]  camera on quick parry. and he has like a teleportation ring. oh, creature down. get it.
[5760.16s -> 5768.72s]  kill it. well, you got... you did what you were supposed to do, but I didn't have to pay you
[5768.72s -> 5779.09s]  any money, so that's good. trading post? down... where? down here? that's actually not a good
[5779.09s -> 5794.14s]  idea. let's see what we got. put it close to one of the guard houses? oh, fuck. who just died?
[5794.14s -> 5807.38s]  that was in quick parry, right? fuck. get those taxes. more. more money. all right, quick parry's
[5807.38s -> 5811.22s]  going down here with his like... he made... everyone wants to follow quick parry because he's just so
[5811.22s -> 5822.21s]  good. how much... how many potions does he have? five. you need more than that, don't you? fuck it.
[5822.21s -> 5832.58s]  get him out of here. this is as far as it can go. we'll go to level three. not yet. need more. rogue
[5832.58s -> 5841.87s]  skilled. five is the max carry for potions? oh, okay. makes sense. the burger was good, a little
[5841.87s -> 5849.84s]  too salty. definitely an s-tier though for fast food. oh, yeah. yep. we got the official review.
[5849.84s -> 5854.61s]  fries kind of suck. yeah, that's... they do.
[5859.34s -> 5869.22s]  all right, i can almost do level three. what are we doing down here? oh, look at this fucking party
[5869.22s -> 5880.38s]  down here. keep going. i can do... i'm gonna beat it right now. stay together. take the whole thing.
[5881.10s -> 5885.74s]  ash house in vegas was great. i'm so happy that somebody ate there.
[5887.33s -> 5892.85s]  quick parry gonna go and just kind of take this whole thing by himself.
[5896.22s -> 5903.49s]  go rescue him by yourself, dude. he even helps out his teammates. how do i keep this guy around
[5903.49s -> 5909.49s]  forever? uh, ash house or gogo in the link is... the burgers are just unfucking believable. the
[5909.49s -> 5913.97s]  food's unbelievable. it's up in 24 hours. if you're ever in las vegas, do yourself a favor
[5915.31s -> 5919.07s]  and eat that. just eat at ash house or gogo. it's like the best fucking... like at least
[5919.07s -> 5927.47s]  late night restaurant in vegas. uh, where the hell is this prince? okay, i'm gonna build down here.
[5927.47s -> 5932.67s]  this... we kind of cleared this out. let's do, um... there's an inn here. let's do... can i build
[5932.67s -> 5948.08s]  another, like, citadel? like, i can't, right? level three, let's go. do your best jay Leno impression.
[5948.08s -> 5962.43s]  oh, okay. uh, okay, recruit rogue. i got pretty much full on all that. marketplace is good.
[5963.39s -> 5970.18s]  beast approaches. what do i want to build down here? another... i'm gonna build another wizards
[5970.18s -> 5977.46s]  guild. or a marketplace. yeah, fuck it, let's go. just, like, get it, like, right here.
[5981.86s -> 5990.51s]  fairgrounds? all right, hold on. royal gardens? i need a wizards tower. i need some, like,
[5991.15s -> 5996.86s]  i can't. i need a wizards tower. no, it's so expensive. i need a guard house here.
[5997.82s -> 6005.18s]  keep quick parry down here. uh-oh. oh, shit. what is this? oh, fuck. that's a minotaur.
[6006.22s -> 6010.14s]  quick parry, get him! both of you together. work together. that... i haven't seen that before.
[6012.19s -> 6016.75s]  come on, quick parry. do it! oh, fuck. he's really strong. quick parry, run away!
[6016.75s -> 6028.18s]  run away, quick parry! you can't... not gonna be able to do it. oh, no, he has healing potions.
[6028.18s -> 6037.02s]  all right, good. keep it going. protect this area, quick parry. try to keep the marketplaces
[6037.02s -> 6040.14s]  close to the palace, because the tax collector needs to get all the way to them. that's true.
[6040.78s -> 6045.58s]  all right, the peasants are down here. let's do a mage guild tower. Your Majesty,
[6045.58s -> 6050.70s]  a new building is complete. no, no, no, no. stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[6050.70s -> 6053.50s]  let's do a... no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. a... an inn. put an inn
[6053.50s -> 6055.42s]  down here. quick. come on, come on, come on. stay, stay, stay, stay. it's down here.
[6055.42s -> 6062.86s]  I'm gonna do another an inn. I'm gonna do a trading post. That might be dumb. I
[6062.86s -> 6070.78s]  don't know. Statue? We're building a whole other town down here. Wizards Guild
[6070.78s -> 6088.82s]  right there. Got it. Creature Den. Get rid of that. Got the inn. Nice. Now we can hang out in
[6088.82s -> 6099.99s]  here. Got a guard house. Put those arrows. All right, this is gonna be a victory
[6099.99s -> 6112.27s]  here. There's so many bears down here. I got it. Trading post. Complete. Wizards
[6112.27s -> 6128.26s]  Guild. Complete. Let's get some wizards. All right, I'm almost out of money. Creature Den.
[6128.26s -> 6153.67s]  Get that for 200 bucks. 300 bucks. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. What the hell are you guys
[6153.67s -> 6164.79s]  doing? This better save. This is gonna crash my game. All right, what the fuck are you doing?
[6164.79s -> 6201.03s]  What are you guys spamming? Piss on me. Piss it. Piss in my face. Do it. I'm fine. I can hold my
[6201.03s -> 6211.50s]  breath. The second I start to smell some pee, I can just boink. I don't know what this is. What
[6211.50s -> 6218.22s]  is this? This is on camera. Piss on me. Piss it. Piss in my face. I don't know what the fuck this is.
[6218.78s -> 6224.35s]  What's the con- I mean, it's clearly on like a stream, but I don't know what the context is.
[6224.35s -> 6230.27s]  This is probably a deep fake. Do it. I'm fine. I can hold my- Is that a deep fake? It might be a deep
[6230.27s -> 6241.19s]  fake. Breath. The second I start to smell some pee, I can just- No, this is from- That's a- I
[6241.19s -> 6250.26s]  think that's a deep fake. You tried though. That sounds like something I would say. And maybe. It
[6250.26s -> 6264.68s]  depends on the context. Does anybody know what that's from? It was from Super Fight. Oh, okay.
[6264.68s -> 6271.10s]  That makes sense. Yeah, Super Fight was you had to come up with insane scenarios as to why your
[6271.10s -> 6285.98s]  character would beat the other person's character. So still no sign of this prince. I don't know
[6285.98s -> 6293.15s]  where the hell he is. Context being behind you wanting someone to piss in your face.
[6296.26s -> 6305.46s]  His superpower was probably like pee. Can I keep exploring down here? Find this prince.
[6305.46s -> 6315.71s]  There's a hundred dollars in it for you. Okay, I'm gonna do- Can I do Farsight from here? I need
[6315.71s -> 6328.41s]  one of those hands out of the ground. Halt! Where's um- Quick Perry is over here. Just hanging out.
[6328.45s -> 6340.94s]  Alright, let's uh- Somebody kill this troll, please. What do I need? What do I need? I need to kill him.
[6340.94s -> 6347.99s]  He's gonna cause a problem. Extort that money. Alright, now I'm gonna do a- What the hell is Fairgrounds?
[6347.99s -> 6357.78s]  I'm just gonna put it over here. I don't even know what it does. Set the agenda for royal tournaments by
[6357.78s -> 6366.10s]  choosing magic, melee, archery, or combo. Heroes may purchase training to enhance their abilities.
[6369.67s -> 6379.85s]  So it's just like a training ground. Can you do an impression of Elmo impersonating Seth
[6379.85s -> 6385.21s]  Rogan impersonating Beetlejuice impersonating Tommy Wiseau making fun of Dan Aykroyd trying
[6385.21s -> 6396.23s]  to sell you crystal skull vodka? What at home? What is it? What does it say again? I don't know
[6396.23s -> 6407.56s]  what that means. I'm not gonna do that. Anyways, let's go down here. Let's get up wizard 2.
[6408.52s -> 6419.78s]  That's too much to think about. My brain stopped comprehending what you were saying after
[6419.78s -> 6428.76s]  the word Seth Rogan. That's it. I don't know. Alright, where is this prince? I've explored
[6428.76s -> 6437.30s]  everything. Alright, you know what? We're making it really worth people's while. Get over here.
[6437.30s -> 6448.34s]  Let's go. 1,500 bucks. Who's on their way? Where's Quick Perry? Message. Oh, there it is. Where? Hold
[6448.34s -> 6457.66s]  on. Did I skip 1,500 bucks for no reason? There was a message flag. Wait, wait, wait. Where is this?
[6458.30s -> 6473.11s]  Oh, there it is. Alright, release the prison. $2,000 to the person that can take this now.
[6473.83s -> 6484.60s]  Quick Perry's just gonna do it by himself. Well, hold on. We got level four. These guys good.
[6489.24s -> 6503.11s]  Quick Perry's gonna just take it all. Get in there. Save the prince. Sick. He teleported behind
[6503.11s -> 6512.04s]  the bear. That's some next level plays by Nelson Quick Perry. This is a victory writer.
[6512.76s -> 6525.62s]  Do I have to bring him back? Here's the worst part about this. I could have finished this
[6525.62s -> 6531.62s]  mission in like five minutes if I had just gone down over here. It's right next to the town.
[6532.26s -> 6540.47s]  I went in a full horseshoe around. That's kind of bullshit, but whatever.
[6540.47s -> 6560.74s]  The obelisk was a hint too. Was it? I kept seeing it. Turn back. Oh, it was one of those stupid
[6561.70s -> 6568.84s]  this is the evil lair. Turn back. Don't come into the evil lair. Promise nothing bad over here. It
[6568.84s -> 6577.86s]  was one of those scenarios. Alright, we saved the prince. The prince is a rat? We saved the
[6577.86s -> 6587.27s]  rat prince. Majesty, your heroes have returned the prince of Val Morgan to his kingdom.
[6588.09s -> 6594.33s]  A caravan from the queen of Val Morgan now waits at our gates. Cool. The treasures it carries are
[6594.33s -> 6599.45s]  most glorious to behold, but more important is this brief note from the queen herself. What was
[6599.45s -> 6605.61s]  he saying? She writes, my thanks for the recovery of my son goes beyond any material reward I could
[6605.61s -> 6611.45s]  offer. Your compassionate leadership is an inspiration to all of Ardenia. That was
[6611.45s -> 6620.23s]  pitch shifted. It was. Clip that and just listen to that again. That last three or four sentences
[6620.23s -> 6633.30s]  were a little higher. Strange. Getting better. The last time I had 47 recruited heroes and
[6633.30s -> 6645.99s]  42 of them died. Now I've been much more focused. Standing buildings, gold balance, okay.
[6646.79s -> 6658.42s]  All right. Quick carried. Let's see. Yes. Senator Jeremy's fine. Nice. Now try another quest.
[6658.42s -> 6664.82s]  Advanced if you haven't yet. Don't tell me to do that. Oh, I'm not ready for advanced. I still
[6664.82s -> 6677.72s]  don't even know what half the buildings do. Do it. No. Look at this one. Expert. This one's beginner.
[6679.14s -> 6689.10s]  Valley of the Serpents. Vengeance of the Lich Queen. Put a bounty on Quick Perry so everyone
[6689.10s -> 6698.81s]  has to attack him and he solos everybody. Put like a $50,000 bounty. Okay. Oh, the dark forest.
[6700.17s -> 6711.94s]  The wizard's curse. Now that sounds really boring. Quest for the crown. Quest for the
[6711.94s -> 6731.38s]  crown. I'm not ready for this. Not ready. I'll try it. I'm not ready though. An enlightening
[6731.38s -> 6736.42s]  discovery, your highness. The crown of Sidrian, the long lost symbol of your family's power,
[6736.42s -> 6742.42s]  has been located. It's being held in an evil fortress on the frontier. The recent waves of
[6742.42s -> 6748.34s]  monster attacks have left your people dispirited. Reclaiming this item will doubtlessly boost your

[6960.98s -> 6973.22s]  Royal treasury is nearly empty. The royal treasury is empty. They just keep coming.
[6975.02s -> 6979.19s]  I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this. I'm gonna have to restart it. An inn? Well,
[6979.19s -> 6983.03s]  it doesn't, you don't have any heroes. Oh fuck. Um. I don't have any money.
[6985.27s -> 6993.10s]  They killed everything. All right. Redo. Redo. Redo. Your majesty. A new building is complete.
[6993.10s -> 7006.10s]  I have to immediately just start melting everybody. No. Restart. Here we go. Right off the bat.

[7041.78s -> 7051.80s]  the fuck out of everybody. Anybody that comes over here. Just, just.

[7084.60s -> 7114.76s]  Again? All right. I've got no more money. I don't have any more money. Oh my god. I'm out of money.
[7118.14s -> 7126.57s]  I don't have any more fucking money. How the hell are you supposed to do this? This is like
[7126.57s -> 7137.42s]  30 minotaurs that come up here. I don't even have money to do this. It's over.
[7141.26s -> 7143.50s]  Get out there. It might not be completely over. Hold on.
[7150.01s -> 7153.61s]  Just raise taxes. Actually this is not. If these guys level up down here.
[7156.38s -> 7161.83s]  Call to arms. Come on. Get everybody back here. Right here. If they can level up. If I can take
[7161.83s -> 7174.44s]  this for a minute. Where's my tax collector? That's okay. Level four. That's not terrible.
[7175.94s -> 7186.70s]  All right. Hold on. I need to build a. Where's the blacksmith? Level three armor. Level three
[7186.70s -> 7192.02s]  weapons. And hopefully these. The warriors can carry it. Where the hell did they go?
[7192.82s -> 7203.80s]  They're all in the inn. Just sitting there. Get out of the inn. Inn. I need a. No. I need an inn.
[7203.80s -> 7208.84s]  No I don't. What do I need? A guard house? That's not going to do anything. What is that?
[7209.96s -> 7218.52s]  What is that and why is it here? Are they going to be able to kill this?
[7226.38s -> 7234.66s]  No way man. No way. You get that. This is too quick. Too fast. Too happening.
[7234.66s -> 7240.70s]  It happened way too quickly. How are you supposed to keep up with this and not lose all your money?
[7246.10s -> 7256.90s]  New building. You just get overwhelmed and you have money but. I wonder.
[7258.82s -> 7262.42s]  I feel like this is like a puzzle level where you just need to do something in a very specific
[7262.42s -> 7280.38s]  order. All right. We're not doing this one. Let's go to. How the hell are you supposed to do that?
[7284.55s -> 7292.01s]  For the slaves. Quest for the magic ring. A deal with the demon. Wizard's curse.
[7292.57s -> 7301.74s]  I'm not the beginner. Should I? Yeah. We're doing the wizard's curse. I'm not going to skip.
[7319.34s -> 7324.94s]  Great tome is beyond measure. You and your realm must now pay a price for its loss.
[7326.14s -> 7333.98s]  Until such a time as sufficient good deeds have been performed I curse all the dwellers of this
[7333.98s -> 7343.05s]  land to be as stupid as the dead. We can have a permanent debuff. Okay hold on. There are two
[7343.05s -> 7348.57s]  different ways to rid the curse. Method one. Arrest the hooligan who stole the book of spells. Return
[7348.57s -> 7354.97s]  it to the wizard and then perform whatever the wizard deems sufficient good deeds. Method two.
[7354.97s -> 7362.26s]  Destroy the angry wizard. Your heroes are cursed so they won't act like their regular selves.
[7363.80s -> 7371.37s]  Wizard's guilds and temples aren't available in this game. Arrest the hooligan who stole the book.
[7374.26s -> 7383.06s]  Okay. Who stole the book? In order to guide your kingdom to prosperity and shed the wizard's curse
[7383.06s -> 7388.34s]  you have two options. Either find the idiot hooligan who stole the book and then perform
[7388.34s -> 7394.50s]  what the wizard refers to as good deeds. Or confront the wizard and destroy him. Send all
[7396.74s -> 7401.86s]  heroes to arrest all of the realm's hooligans so they can be detained and searched at the palace.
[7407.45s -> 7423.50s]  What? Okay well we need we need a marketplace. We need how much money do I have? 13,000?
[7424.14s -> 7438.52s]  I serve with pleasure. How do I um how do I question? Not question um your highness let's do
[7438.52s -> 7446.04s]  if our kingdom is to prosper it needs more heroes. Let's do warriors guild. Warriors guild rangers
[7446.04s -> 7454.89s]  guild right next to each other here. Where are the hooligans? Actually I want two rangers guilds.
[7454.89s -> 7462.33s]  I want a bunch of rangers in due time apparently. All right so your majesty a new building is
[7462.33s -> 7473.66s]  complete. Healing potions are important right off the bat. Let's go with a inn as well over here
[7473.66s -> 7491.66s]  somewhere. Your marketplace now serves you better. How do you detain somebody? The heroes will. Okay
[7492.62s -> 7503.59s]  okay rangers guild let's get a bunch of rangers. Your highness if our kingdom is to prosper it needs
[7503.59s -> 7510.79s]  more heroes. I know that's what I'm doing. A new building is complete. Your marketplace now serves

[7600.34s -> 7612.46s]  What do the gnomes do? I haven't figured that out yet. Let's see. Recruit gnomes. Additional gnome
[7612.46s -> 7616.94s]  hubbles are automatically built as you recruit gnomes. Destroyed hubbles will be rebuilt
[7616.94s -> 7621.98s]  automatically. So just they just keep going all over the place?
[7623.74s -> 7630.44s]  That's cool. They just help build stuff. That's cool. All right let's get another
[7631.88s -> 7637.72s]  building is complete. What's that blacksmith? I need to get better weapons.

[7752.86s -> 7763.10s]  offers new services. Thank god. You're not an idiot. Top five. This map is pretty small. All
[7763.10s -> 7775.72s]  right. So let me build. I serve with pleasure. I don't have an inn. Who died? Somebody's dead?

[7787.90s -> 7798.33s]  right. Let's let this guy's got to go. He's down here too far. Somebody kill it. Friendly lodge up
[7798.33s -> 7804.66s]  here. Your majesty a new building is complete. That's too tough for me. At least you're smart
[7804.66s -> 7811.05s]  enough to know that. We've got to get rid of this thing. No the level one is going to go and fight
[7811.05s -> 7824.25s]  it. No. It's just sitting outside the door staring at us. Oh get these. All right there's a hooligan
[7824.25s -> 7837.61s]  right there. Go get him. Open these treasure boxes. Guess that's the guy right there. Collect him.
[7838.25s -> 7841.93s]  There he is. One of your heroes has arrested a hooligan. Maybe this is the subject who stole
[7841.93s -> 7850.68s]  the book. He's on his way to do your palace to be interrogated. Nice. Hopefully he doesn't get hit
[7850.68s -> 7865.22s]  by like a rock. We're good right? Is it him? I want to like keep my eye on him. What's going on over
[7865.22s -> 7883.45s]  here? He's being leeched of levels by what? Okay in the palace. Who's in there? What's that ring
[7883.45s -> 7902.39s]  thing? Was it him? Oh what? Another person arrested. Get him in there. So this is the second
[7902.39s -> 7913.93s]  person we've arrested. Who is the one? Who's the illegal guy? All right let me focus on this again.
[7914.65s -> 7929.02s]  Go to the blacksmith. Get uh level three weapons. Message another one. Arrested another person over
[7929.02s -> 7937.19s]  here. They're all on this side. Explore over here. They seem to all be like hanging out over here.
[7942.65s -> 7946.41s]  Majesty the local blacksmith offers new services.
[7949.05s -> 7954.25s]  How are we doing on this? Good. That's not good. That's pretty bad actually. Get rid of that now.
[7954.25s -> 7957.29s]  That's scary of enemy. 700 bucks kill it.
[7962.63s -> 7968.92s]  New services. You have arrested every hooligan in the land except one. The other hooligans have
[7968.92s -> 7973.96s]  confessed to his whereabouts. Unfortunately he has learned some spells from the spell book
[7973.96s -> 7988.28s]  and is not likely to return it without a fight. Where is he? Is this him? Is he level 10? Wait
[7988.28s -> 7996.47s]  he's just like coming up to the city. Kill him. What is he dropping? He's dropping like a nuke on
[7996.47s -> 8008.14s]  us. Oh my god. A thousand dollars to the man that kills him. Do I have anybody that's like
[8008.14s -> 8017.66s]  level five or 10? All right here we go. 1100 bucks kill him. My services may help. Oh no
[8017.66s -> 8023.10s]  and a rat just came out. Does everybody get on him? Level four. Level four. Level four.
[8025.37s -> 8032.52s]  Why would you not attack the guy that's over here? Get him. Get him. Kill him.
[8038.60s -> 8051.86s]  He's learned a few spells. Got it. Get the book. There it is. Now what? Now what do we do?
[8052.42s -> 8071.03s]  What's going on? I'm confused. Do we have to return the book? Wooden sign. Peasant. What's
[8071.03s -> 8087.46s]  a peasant doing over here? All right get rid of this. Fancy iron sign. Okay. How do I give
[8087.46s -> 8113.05s]  him the book? That's a trader peasant. What do you mean trader peasant? Is that a trader? I don't
[8113.05s -> 8119.74s]  have enough money. I need more like uh I need a trading post right? I wonder if I can no no no
[8119.74s -> 8126.41s]  don't attack it. Now that you have recovered his spell book the wizard who cursed your kingdom
[8126.41s -> 8130.57s]  demands that you perform adequate good deeds in order to atone for your citizens blunders.
[8130.57s -> 8136.49s]  There is a peasant who has been taken captive by a few crazed werewolves. Free her and dispel
[8136.49s -> 8148.90s]  the curse for good. That's her right there. He's almost dead. Level seven. How do I free her?
[8149.70s -> 8156.33s]  I serve with pleasure. Call to arms. Get everybody in now.
[8158.97s -> 8173.34s]  What do we how do we save her? Um what do we do about this? She's just walking around the town.
[8179.11s -> 8181.83s]  Kill the werewolves baby. All right well don't nobody kill her.
[8183.83s -> 8191.14s]  I'll get to build it again. All right here we go werewolves. We're not ready for this yet.
[8191.14s -> 8195.99s]  I need some more level heroes but you're the only one that's worth anything right now.
[8198.36s -> 8200.68s]  You just keep exploring. I'm gonna destroy some of this shit over here.
[8201.48s -> 8207.67s]  Where's the um building has been upgraded. What the fuck is the we gotta wipe out some of this
[8207.67s -> 8217.34s]  trash down here. Yeah ruin shrine. Get rid of this. Okay I need some more uh I need more warriors.
[8217.34s -> 8227.69s]  Some more rangers. Some more maybe some rogues. Getting rid of this creature den too. My services
[8227.69s -> 8235.75s]  may help. Level four armor for that first level four weapons. You're gonna take that on yourself?
[8235.75s -> 8242.10s]  Okay good. How many werewolves are there? There's probably like looks like four or five.
[8242.74s -> 8257.62s]  You're not doing too bad. Somebody died. Um palace is really expensive. Majesty the local
[8257.62s -> 8262.34s]  blacksmith offers new services. All right level four weapons in armor are available.
[8263.46s -> 8271.22s]  I didn't even I'm just gonna recruit like five ten gnomes. Just bring them out here.
[8274.28s -> 8287.42s]  Uh oh. House is full. House is full. Those things aren't as dangerous as I keep thinking they are.
[8287.42s -> 8294.07s]  A local blacksmith offers new services. Level seven. This guy's just been farming this building
[8294.07s -> 8304.06s]  and leveled up like three times. All right uh marketplace down here. Trading post. I don't
[8304.06s -> 8311.98s]  know how I need a trading post. Trading post you need to needs to be close right.
[8314.94s -> 8322.73s]  Let me look at this one more time. Here is my purchase healing potions. Caravans periodically
[8322.73s -> 8329.45s]  depart from your trading post bringing gold to your marketplace. The more further away the more
[8329.45s -> 8334.73s]  gold it makes. So so like if I put it all the way down here then it'll be a lot of money.
[8335.61s -> 8340.34s]  So you want your marketplaces to be close but you want your trading posts to be far away.
[8340.98s -> 8345.91s]  Well level nine get back. Don't kill yourself here. Don't like get killed.
[8348.55s -> 8358.09s]  Teleport back to town. All right. A new building is complete. Take this out. 200 bucks.
[8361.59s -> 8367.37s]  All right. Your trading post now offers healing potions.
[8371.80s -> 8375.00s]  Always upgrade your marketplace level three as soon as possible.
[8377.03s -> 8384.12s]  Just tech. Yeah that's true. All right trading post is here. Another one of these uh
[8388.76s -> 8393.62s]  the gnomes are actually kind of cool because they just they kind of just like run around
[8393.62s -> 8397.54s]  aimlessly in random places and help. So that's cool. I'm gonna keep as many of them as I can.
[8398.26s -> 8404.79s]  100 bucks whatever kills that. All right uh I think it's time to go and kill the werewolves.
[8411.85s -> 8418.50s]  All right. They're gonna kill this. Oh shit. A level seven died here.
[8422.20s -> 8426.92s]  Why would you aggro the tree when just kill this? Don't kill her.
[8436.95s -> 8445.98s]  1900. I need to get this level three. I'm on my way. Yeah they're doing all right. After this
[8445.98s -> 8452.98s]  I'll have a couple of leg level nines. How beast approaches. You idiot. I knew that was
[8452.98s -> 8464.23s]  gonna happen. I knew that was gonna happen. I just knew it. All right. Now here we go.
[8466.31s -> 8485.24s]  300 for you. 300 400 for you. 400 for you. Go for it. Take out the werewolves. Do not attack this
[8485.24s -> 8490.47s]  building. That would be a very big mistake. Heroes can be resurrected if you build a mausoleum.
[8492.44s -> 8503.61s]  Really that's cool. Get out of here. I mean that was a lot of money but I haven't been able to do
[8503.61s -> 8514.60s]  that the whole game. Oh shit. Too much confidence. Too much confidence. How many healing potions? No
[8514.60s -> 8524.28s]  more healing potions. Why did you do this? Level 10 is about to die. Oh man. Get out. Don't be an
[8524.28s -> 8531.02s]  idiot. Don't be an idiot. I did it. I did it.
[8561.64s -> 8564.04s]  Back in storage. All should be well.
[8568.55s -> 8571.72s]  That was a pretty good Disney goofy thing.
[8575.64s -> 8584.36s]  All right cool. My ladies it's good to see you again. As you're well aware
[8584.36s -> 8591.40s]  Ardenia's heartlands have flourished under your steady rule. Indeed your leadership has ushered
[8591.40s -> 8597.40s]  in a new era of prosperity. Ready for expert. However the untamed frontier of the northern
[8597.40s -> 8604.52s]  reaches remains a haven for chaotic forces that still threaten our fair land. It is my council
[8604.52s -> 8611.00s]  that you begin a northern expansion to dwell these agents of turmoil. While this adventure presents
[8611.00s -> 8618.20s]  great challenges it offers even greater rewards. I'll now take my leave majesty so that you may
[8618.20s -> 8625.67s]  consider this undertaking and decide where to begin. So here's something that I'm not I don't
[8625.67s -> 8638.57s]  really understand. So am I getting something for doing this? The rewards will be in my or is it
[8638.57s -> 8646.62s]  just missions? Because is there a reason to do anything? It's just the campaign okay. Well
[8647.74s -> 8653.50s]  let's try another advanced one. Hold off the goblin hordes. I don't like those ones.
[8654.87s -> 8663.51s]  Trade routes. Clash of empires. Legendary heroes. Rise of the rat men.
[8668.39s -> 8673.99s]  Sovereign the rat men grow bolder day by day. Their numbers appear to increase and strange
[8673.99s -> 8679.91s]  new sounds can be heard issuing from our sewers. Rumors have reached our ears of a new ruler among
[8679.91s -> 8687.51s]  rat kind. I'll road it with a taste for surface conquest. We must be vigilant against a potential
[8687.59s -> 8694.15s]  rat men invasion. If they choose to strike we must target their new leader. Without their ruler the
[8694.15s -> 8702.38s]  rat men will not be able to maintain such an onslaught. So destroy rodent the rat king and
[8702.38s -> 8716.12s]  all broken sewer mains in the realm. Now I get to be the giant rat. So we gotta kill rodent the rat
[8716.12s -> 8729.77s]  king. Look at all these sewer entrances. What? There's a ratapult. Oh my god um level two level
[8729.77s -> 8740.49s]  um elven bungalow. I need some guard houses I think. Embassy.

[8778.94s -> 8793.77s]  want to blow all my money here though. Fill the sewers with lava. I could. Your highness

[8857.27s -> 8864.06s]  Are the elves good? Yeah I'm just gonna fill this place with elves.
[8867.10s -> 8878.74s]  What's wrong with this person's voice? Are we taking this out? Get rid of this. This is like

[9443.88s -> 9457.24s]  We have to start clearing all these rat holes. I need to put up though. I don't have any fucking money.
[9458.44s -> 9472.28s]  Tax collector. How much you got? $40. The guard tower. I'm just trying to see.
[9472.28s -> 9479.08s]  Money wise. I don't have very much. All right. I gotta fucking get rid of these.
[9479.16s -> 9483.82s]  I gotta fucking get rid of these. $400 to get rid of that. Take out that that rat hole.

[9534.63s -> 9545.88s]  Here they come. Another big rat recruitment. Well they all have good weapons. They're all
[9545.88s -> 9552.20s]  leveled up as high as they can. The royal treasury is nearly empty. Do I need more? I still I kind
[9552.20s -> 9560.63s]  of don't understand how this works. I'm still trying to figure because it's almost like rise
[9560.63s -> 9573.62s]  in nations. Are they actually gonna go up here? Marketplace level three.
[9581.43s -> 9587.42s]  Oh they're doing it. No they're not. He's gonna die. Why are you the only one up here man?
[9588.54s -> 9593.83s]  How could you be the only person up here? And you're very strong too. This is bad.
[9594.63s -> 9604.94s]  Why would you go up there by yourself at level four? Shit. No. No. Everybody come back.
[9609.66s -> 9622.82s]  Beast approaches. We gotta get rid of this shit. I need to make a...
[9628.30s -> 9632.78s]  I don't know what would be... a wizards guild? I'm gonna make a wizards guild I think.
[9634.06s -> 9640.26s]  Because I lost a couple people I think. They're gonna level up.
[9640.90s -> 9652.73s]  I don't know if they're gonna be able to hold us off. Come on kill it. They're just pouring people
[9652.73s -> 9662.36s]  over here. Never ending. You have to kill those little rat dens immediately. Like within five
[9662.36s -> 9669.46s]  minutes of the game starting or you lose. I just don't know like the all the tech trees to be able
[9669.46s -> 9675.59s]  to go that fast. It's still possible if I can level these guys up to like level eight, nine,
[9675.59s -> 9683.51s]  ten. At least most of them or half of them even. Still have only 1300 bucks. Marketplace is gone.
[9684.47s -> 9690.65s]  Majesty! The palace is under siege! You did it! All right. He did it. He did it. He got that one.
[9690.65s -> 9706.10s]  I think there's only two more. Stay alive. Keep this alive. Please. You can do it. The critters
[9706.10s -> 9719.06s]  are under attack. Okay I need my marketplace back. Marketplace. Marketplace. Marketplace.

[9771.94s -> 9779.85s]  I don't have any money. Your marketplace now serves you better. New wave is going to be
[9779.85s -> 9793.30s]  coming here in a second. Where's Sir Stahl? What? Don't kill the warrior's guild. This is it. All
[9793.30s -> 9801.93s]  right. Take him out. Get rid of this rat cave and then I should be all right. I might get a minute
[9801.93s -> 9827.96s]  here. There we go. Take it out. Nice. Keep doing it. You guys can do it. Yes. I need an inn.
[9829.96s -> 9833.56s]  They killed the inn. They also got rid of the dwarf thing that was over here. All right. I need
[9833.56s -> 9842.70s]  an inn for people to hang out and rest. I need to make money. Don't go all the way over here.
[9842.70s -> 9848.30s]  Please guys. What are you thinking? Don't do that. You're just going to die. There's no reason for
[9848.30s -> 9854.10s]  you to go over there. Level six. Level four. I need you guys. Your marketplace now serves you
[9854.10s -> 9865.91s]  better. Better marketplace. Good. Market day. There's nothing even in there. I haven't even
[9865.91s -> 9870.95s]  explored half the map. No, I know. Are these two just going to be like a team here and go take a
[9870.95s -> 9880.54s]  bunch of shit out? Sewer entrance. I think they're just going to be on their own. Hopefully they stay
[9880.54s -> 9888.38s]  together. What do we got? Level seven. Level six. We have a couple level sevens now. All right.
[9888.38s -> 9897.18s]  Kill this thing. Please. I need the marketplace down here.
[9903.18s -> 9912.31s]  Forever penniless. I need an inn though. That's more important because I just I need an inn over
[9912.31s -> 9924.71s]  here. Who's had that? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. What did you guys do over here? What did

[9957.06s -> 9961.02s]  Please stay alive. They're destroying the palace.
[9964.73s -> 9970.49s]  Holy shit man. This is hard. This is insane. I don't know where he is but I think people
[9970.49s -> 9974.41s]  are dying. Level eight. Where's uh stall? Stall is in the middle right here.
[9976.41s -> 9980.97s]  Come on. You can do it. He's got one. They're already at a 65 HP. Come on.
[9981.77s -> 9995.56s]  Get everybody over here. Call the arms. This is over. I'm dead. Unless like actually stall does
[9995.56s -> 10004.89s]  this on his own. What am I supposed to do about this? I hit the enrage timer. I had to have.
[10005.61s -> 10022.10s]  Majesty. The palace is under siege. Stall dead? He's dead. Wow. This is really really really hard.
[10024.26s -> 10038.82s]  Wow. You gotta be bang bang bang bang bang bang bang. Go faster. Yeah I know right.
[10040.47s -> 10052.79s]  He's alive. Take that. This guy is. Your actions permitted or two. Well beast approaches. Well I
[10052.79s -> 10067.90s]  mean the palace is under siege. I probably. These guys are still alive though. They're
[10068.46s -> 10073.26s]  this might not be a total loss. Well the palace is gonna explode but can these guys do it? Look
[10073.26s -> 10077.78s]  they're kind of melting this thing. I got a couple level. I got a level eight in here.
[10080.14s -> 10090.06s]  Well of course they came out of the sewer. Level seven. No level eight's dead. I just
[10090.06s -> 10101.67s]  don't have enough money. Name of the sovereign. Oh well. I'm kind of surviving but I don't have
[10101.67s -> 10106.71s]  enough money to supplement anybody here and I don't want to build anybody. I don't want to
[10106.71s -> 10116.62s]  because this is gonna be level one. I need an inn for them to go into. Somebody please build an inn.
[10116.62s -> 10124.50s]  In the name of the sovereign. My prowess is unmatched. They're kind of doing it but
[10132.82s -> 10146.15s]  it almost feels like it for nothing. There's another broken sewer man over here. They're alive.
[10147.67s -> 10164.34s]  They're alive but they just never-endingly pour in. I need an inn. Please build an inn for these
[10164.34s -> 10175.21s]  guys to hang out in. Level eight. Level eight. Level eight. Level seven. I think this is possible.
[10178.65s -> 10184.25s]  They're all gonna be leveled up. They all have the best armor. They have the best weapons.
[10184.89s -> 10189.11s]  I just need potions. I need a marketplace so they can buy potions.
[10190.62s -> 10199.70s]  Your majesty, our new building is complete. Okay the inn is done. Marketplace.
[10200.42s -> 10217.66s]  1400. Come on. I lived. I actually lived. These guys are actually really really high level now.
[10218.38s -> 10219.98s]  Come on. Where's my money?
[10219.98s -> 10234.02s]  I'm just getting free levels.
[10237.00s -> 10239.40s]  You know what I'm telling you at this point I think I gotta just go.
[10240.44s -> 10244.12s]  I gotta just go take this band of people and have them explore up here and try to just kill
[10244.12s -> 10257.80s]  the rap king. I think that's the plan. That's the strategy. I got two one two three little eights.
[10258.68s -> 10261.37s]  Maybe just let them just hang around here and just gain.
[10263.13s -> 10271.93s]  Is my blacksmith gone? Kind of. All right. Thousand bucks.
[10273.85s -> 10283.59s]  I wouldn't go all the way down there if anything. Go this way. I didn't know you
[10283.59s -> 10294.68s]  guys were still alive. I still have these random explorers. No! Okay that's just-
[10295.32s -> 10299.22s]  All right. I'm done. Instead of every single person. Let's go.
[10299.70s -> 10305.13s]  Majesty the palace is under siege. Oh my god. I can't believe you just let the fucking happen.
[10306.54s -> 10321.77s]  Let's go. Everybody up there now. Explore. Go. Forget it. Beast approaches.
[10323.14s -> 10327.38s]  I have no- I just have no money. I can't do anything. I'm just constantly putting
[10327.94s -> 10330.90s]  my fingers in holes that are spewing out on the side of the boat.

[10397.03s -> 10408.79s]  Why is he the only person that cares about this? This is very very concerning.
[10418.66s -> 10434.04s]  Nobody else cares. And he's gonna get lost up here and he's gonna die. Good work. I don't have
[10434.04s -> 10456.74s]  enough money to pay the bounty. Where is the king? Where's Rat King? I think they're gonna
[10456.74s -> 10467.38s]  do it though. I think they'll be okay. Are they? Who's still alive? Level eight. Level eight. Level
[10467.46s -> 10487.93s]  seven. They're all right. He's not even going for the bounty. All right. Find it. In the name of

[10553.94s -> 10558.02s]  Why won't you just go over here? What? You're gonna walk all the way back down because you
[10558.02s -> 10561.70s]  want the bounty that is already down here that's being claimed by everybody that's already down
[10561.70s -> 10578.39s]  here. There's a scroll? Where's the scroll? Rodan the Rat King has burst up from the sewers to take
[10578.39s -> 10585.29s]  over your kingdom. Destroy him and all the broken sewer mains to end the menace. Wait was he? Where
[10585.29s -> 10592.49s]  is he? In the name of the sovereign. Where is he? Majesty the palace is under siege. Where the hell did he go?
[10597.24s -> 10611.53s]  Where? He's here? I don't see him. We've got two level nines. Every single sewer is a broken sewer

[10664.78s -> 10673.67s]  Take that. Is he over here? Kill him. Kill him. He's right there. There he is.
[10674.79s -> 10684.15s]  Somebody kill him and then destroy all of them. Majesty ill treasury is nearly. He's just walking
[10684.15s -> 10697.06s]  around in circles. Uh this sucks. It's over. Hold your majesty. Anybody gonna go get him? No.

[10727.91s -> 10733.94s]  right? Majesty the palace is under siege. In the name of the sovereign.
[10739.19s -> 10749.24s]  Day is lost majesty but there's always tomorrow. Well maybe it had something to do with the fact

[10800.25s -> 10806.49s]  unconsciousness the mighty wizard Brezenthal insisted that there was only one way to halt
[10806.49s -> 10813.29s]  this affliction. You must recover the ring of healing which the legends say is located somewhere

[19022.28s -> 19027.32s]  with the hostile and barbaric kingdom of borg in the conqueror has brought us to a siege of his
[19027.32s -> 19033.64s]  stronghold we must either force his surrender by blockading his supply caravans or storm his
[19034.60s -> 19042.68s]  this game is complicated by our local wizard skill which has chosen to side with borgens forces
[19042.68s -> 19045.88s]  still i feel we can prevail if you act decisively
[19057.58s -> 19064.62s]  okay what's the plan destroy borgens palace or cut off the caravan routes supplying him with gold
[19066.49s -> 19070.25s]  if they run out of resources they will surely be forced to surrender to our forces
[19070.25s -> 19079.58s]  no wizard guilds may be built okay what i got in the front here guard houses upgrade them

[20953.40s -> 20968.52s]  i think that's a good place to go so i've got to tell you that's pretty fun there's a little
[20968.52s -> 20976.14s]  you know just it was cool i vaguely remember playing this a long long time ago vaguely
[20976.78s -> 20985.59s]  and not understanding what to do and i still didn't but no that was fun so i have a list of
[20985.59s -> 20995.58s]  games that i would like to play over this next few days and those games are gonna be where the
[20995.66s -> 21003.77s]  hell are they oh also this weekend i'm gonna give some details on that highlights activity book
[21003.77s -> 21013.66s]  stream we're gonna lock down uh kind of how that's gonna play out gta online i want to get some
[21013.66s -> 21017.02s]  friends together for that so i don't really know when that's gonna happen but it should be
[21017.02s -> 21027.51s]  fairly soon also uh there's not going to be a stream tomorrow i know i have so many things
[21027.51s -> 21036.60s]  to do tomorrow that i just can't this is not gonna happen but on saturday and sunday we will
[21036.60s -> 21046.74s]  go extra long saturday and sunday will be very long streams we'll probably play at least a couple
[21046.74s -> 21056.58s]  games on each of those streams not 24 hours but those streams will probably be at least
[21056.58s -> 21060.90s]  eight to ten hours long i would say because i had there's a lot of games that i have queued up that
[21060.90s -> 21069.24s]  i want to play but i was gonna stream tomorrow but decided to be just way too much shit to do
[21070.20s -> 21078.76s]  that it was just nowhere i was gonna be able to do it so i'll see you guys on saturday
[21078.76s -> 21086.76s]  and sunday we'll do a weekend long weekend thing the games list is let me just go over here let's
[21086.76s -> 21096.81s]  turn this off exit game i thought that was fun once you understand how the actual game works
[21096.81s -> 21101.69s]  it's kind of interesting to see what they do i wish there was a little more variables and
[21101.69s -> 21104.89s]  variants to what they did but we're also talking about a game that came out in 2000
[21108.28s -> 21113.14s]  so i have where's my list i'm gonna go over a list of things that i'm gonna do
[21120.54s -> 21129.10s]  i want to try to get this game ripper to work it's an old fmv game with christopher walken and
[21129.10s -> 21134.94s]  i think like paul giamatti it's an absurd fmv game that i want to try on saturday
[21134.94s -> 21141.82s]  okay i also have ordered and should be here in the next few days this is not going to happen this
[21141.82s -> 21146.54s]  weekend um actually no that's a little that's that's a little bit of a surprise i won't talk
[21146.54s -> 21150.22s]  about that but it's going to be something fucked up that you'll see on the stream in the next few
[21150.22s -> 21166.26s]  days the rain screen no uh there's also that new um that from software game that came up
[21166.26s -> 21176.70s]  um the mech one what's it called metal wolf chaos it looked interesting i kind of wanted to play it

[21198.54s -> 21205.26s]  action oh maybe i see if i can get a few friends to play half dead two that game looks ridiculous

[21678.90s -> 21692.38s]  for the 10 bucks four times a week kappa i know i was i was up until the carnival up until uh the
[21692.38s -> 21702.42s]  carnival stream really started to get work done on it i was doing four times a week now it's been
[21702.42s -> 21710.66s]  kind of brought down to like two or three but all things patience patience all things you'll see
[21711.30s -> 21725.00s]  despite your big projects i always enjoy the small streams i'm not i'm not gonna stop doing that
[21727.35s -> 21731.43s]  i said that a long long time ago this is like probably two or three years ago
[21732.31s -> 21740.15s]  i said that i want to start to move more focus onto stuff that's not video games i did say that
[21740.79s -> 21746.33s]  and slowly i've been trying to find ways to make more interesting things potentially happen on
[21746.33s -> 21753.58s]  streams not just playing a game or not just kind of hanging out trying to figure out what would
[21753.58s -> 21767.34s]  be fun to do with like a live broadcast and i think over the last year or two i have been
[21767.34s -> 21781.13s]  throwing in a lot of stuff that's not me just playing a game but no i don't i don't think i'll
[21781.13s -> 21789.02s]  ever not do stuff like this because i have fun just sitting here hanging out and talking
[21793.82s -> 21800.46s]  and you can't really do that with uh some of the streams that i've done in the past
[21801.34s -> 21809.45s]  it's fun just to talk and crack fucking jokes and have you guys like chime in and say shit
[21809.45s -> 21817.90s]  and it's fun it's funny i don't think this will stop but i will definitely be putting more time
[21817.90s -> 21832.92s]  and effort into that other side really depending on how well this stream is received will be an
[21832.92s -> 21843.62s]  indicator of how hard i want to pursue continuing down that road which i think i i i really don't
[21843.62s -> 21858.34s]  see how this wouldn't be a really fun stream we'll see but thank you thank you apple ship of the 250
[21858.98s -> 21864.63s]  hey man this is gonna be sappy uh but you're kind of the best thing that's happened to my mental
[21864.63s -> 21869.83s]  health in a really long time and i want to say thank you for that your old tf2 commentary videos
[21869.83s -> 21875.43s]  especially are indescribably comforting i have ptsd and it could be hard to calm myself down
[21875.43s -> 21879.99s]  sometimes but putting on one of those has been just what i needed recently sorry this is kind
[21879.99s -> 21883.35s]  of long but yeah you help a lot of people in a lot more ways than you realize have a good one
[21889.35s -> 21903.40s]  that's moving in a million ways that i can't even i can't even express i am so happy that people can
[21903.40s -> 21909.48s]  get much more out of this than simply just you know watch it and laugh and and then that's it
[21918.62s -> 21926.34s]  if this helps if it does i i i there's not much i can say i'm so fucking glad that you have
[21926.34s -> 21944.14s]  something here take care of yourself thanks for watching for as long as you have

[22706.46s -> 22711.34s]  to see how he really felt was beyond words and every time it seemed they could just keep going
[22711.34s -> 22717.74s]  the punishment would get worse one day a woman stopped in to buy some bread he didn't listen to
[22718.30s -> 22725.26s]  he didn't seem to care what then one day he walked right into her bedroom she screamed and ran out
