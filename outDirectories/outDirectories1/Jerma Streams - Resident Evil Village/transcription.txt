[2.36s -> 11.90s]  Oh, all right. Hello. Fuck this dog hair all over my boomer vitamin. No, I just like touched him.
[11.90s -> 16.92s]  I just like petted him. I was like, okay, Otto, it's time to start the stream. Now I've got
[16.92s -> 25.22s]  fucking dog hair all over my boomer vitamins. Yeah, sorry I'm late today. I had some major p-
[26.98s -> 34.10s]  Okay, hold on a second. Let's take, hold on. Okay. I had some major PC fan issues that I
[34.10s -> 40.87s]  have since resolved. Let's hope my computer doesn't explode. That my case fans stop spinning.
[42.09s -> 48.01s]  All of them. The front ones. So I had to figure out why that was. So, you know, I'll take it apart,
[48.01s -> 53.21s]  plugged it back in, changed it, fucked with the power supply. Here's the TLDR for all of you.
[55.50s -> 62.34s]  There are one, two, three, four case fans in here. One of them is permanently just doesn't
[62.34s -> 70.34s]  work anymore. So I really hope that my 3090 is not going to burn out because one of the case fans
[70.34s -> 77.93s]  doesn't turn on. But we're good. I might turn the graphics down a little bit. You're lying.
[80.84s -> 87.94s]  I swear to God. I don't know. I have this, this is a 30, I'm on a 3090 right now. You can make fun
[87.94s -> 93.14s]  of me all you want. I got, this is a 3090. You'll see it. This, this is the first real stream that
[93.14s -> 99.80s]  you're going to see with the 3090. What game have I played in the last like three or four weeks that
[99.80s -> 111.86s]  required anything more than like a fucking 780? That hasn't happened. The invisible hand, that
[111.86s -> 119.43s]  did not require a 3090. That wasn't getting the full capabilities of the 3090. Anyways, today,
[119.43s -> 123.51s]  yes, we're going to play Resident Evil Village. I have no idea how long the stream is going to be.
[124.15s -> 129.67s]  I plan on going two days. I might just get obsessed with it and play a shitload of it tonight. I might
[129.67s -> 133.67s]  be like after four or five hours. You know what? Fuck this. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll see.
[136.81s -> 140.09s]  Even if I give myself an extra hour, it doesn't matter. I'm sitting there like taking my computer
[140.09s -> 147.61s]  apart going like, I got to be live in like fucking 45 minutes. Every second counts. I get pissed off
[147.61s -> 155.66s]  when I have to pee. You get pushed against the clock and like a 60 second piss infuriates you.
[156.38s -> 158.86s]  I'm just sitting there going like, hurry the fuck up.
[160.78s -> 166.20s]  Why? I drank too much water today. That's 60 seconds that I couldn't have been inside the
[166.20s -> 177.19s]  computer. You're a goof. No, I'm telling you. All right. Yes, we're doing face cam today.
[177.91s -> 230.76s]  I need, let me tweet this. I'll be right back. Give me a second. Wait, it's, it's not, it's not
[230.76s -> 243.58s]  village. It's V-I-L-L-A-G-E. I thought it was V-I-L-L-I-A-G-E. Like village. Like a village.
[243.58s -> 248.86s]  A village. It's village. I thought it was village. Like a welcome to the village.
[250.01s -> 253.45s]  I, I, I, well, you must think I've been really stupid over the years. I've never,
[253.45s -> 260.97s]  I've never done A. It's IA. Village. I don't know why I'm still holding these.
[262.30s -> 267.58s]  Okay. I'm holding these for some reason. I want to take these on stream and I think it's like funny
[267.58s -> 274.57s]  for some reason. Like, I don't know. Explain to me why I think this is funny. Oh, hold on.
[275.21s -> 281.38s]  Taking my turmeric. Wait, why is that funny? Well, taking, taking my, taking my like B vitamins.
[281.38s -> 285.74s]  Like why do I think they're taking like drugs? They're not even drugs. They're fucking natural
[285.74s -> 295.10s]  supplements. They're not essential oils. It's fucking supplements. It's turmeric. I'm taking it.
[295.10s -> 304.71s]  My pain shit. You know, I got to try something. What is this? Oh, yeah. Right. I forgot. Uh, uh,
[304.71s -> 315.70s]  yeah. This is a Fiji water. Hold on. There's not actually Fiji water in here. See, when I finish a
[315.70s -> 321.10s]  Fiji bottle, I just refill it with regular water. I still walk around and drink it. So people think
[321.10s -> 328.66s]  I'm fucking very high class. Fucking pro tip. There's actually just regular water in here.
[328.66s -> 342.44s]  That's illegal. Illegal. He's pissed. No, I just, I'm just having, I have very, very
[343.24s -> 347.48s]  negative energy right now. I'm trying to like expel it before we start playing the game.
[348.20s -> 359.69s]  Oh, by the way, if you thought those were supplements, you fucking have no idea.
[360.94s -> 368.65s]  It's seeing 40 minutes where I can't even fucking read writing. It's turmeric and B vitamins. Give
[368.65s -> 374.25s]  it a, give it a rest. All right. So this is going to be interesting. Hopefully these fans work.
[374.25s -> 378.25s]  You see how big my arms look today? All right. This is resonable village. Hold on.
[380.18s -> 386.79s]  Right. When the edibles kick in, he's getting zonked. No, those are not. Why would it be? I
[386.79s -> 398.22s]  told you it's turmeric. Hope you guys had a good week. I found the piss bottle. That's not pee
[398.22s -> 403.00s]  either. Why is my, what are you doing webcam? Don't do that. I was a good place for the webcam
[403.00s -> 408.90s]  right here. They don't get scared. Oh, and you're like, you don't think I have more than one beverage
[408.90s -> 414.31s]  at this table. I'm prepared. I always am. That's the thing about being a streamer. Somebody said,
[414.31s -> 419.59s]  oh, what's it like being a streamer? You have any advice? Yes. Have like literally every liquid
[419.59s -> 423.27s]  you want to consume and all the food you want to eat for the whole day on the desk when you start
[423.27s -> 435.30s]  the stream. That's all. That's the only advice I'm going to give you. Okay. Looks good. We're
[435.30s -> 442.97s]  going to start resonable village on the brand new 30 90 not doing it on hardcore. No thanks.
[443.69s -> 456.34s]  This can too big. You guys hear it. Village of shadows. Long ago, a young girl went with her
[456.34s -> 462.52s]  mother to pick berries for her father who was hard at work, but the forest greeted them with a dark,
[462.52s -> 469.48s]  cold silence. The bushes empty, yet determined to find the berries. The rascal broke free from
[469.48s -> 476.20s]  his grasp and vanished into the trees. Mothers worried cries faded fast as the girl ran on
[476.20s -> 482.36s]  over vine and under branch and into the forest deep feeling strange eyes upon her. The girl
[482.36s -> 486.20s]  recalled mother's scary bedtime tales and her throat became bone dry.
[487.72s -> 494.92s]  Then the bat Lord appeared. He greeted her warmly and bit his own wing. Come child quench you a
[494.92s -> 501.72s]  thirst he said. So she drank the thick dark blood and smiled with joy passing through the
[501.72s -> 510.44s]  graveyard menacing storm clouds loomed and the air turned cold shivering in her thin clothes.
[510.44s -> 514.52s]  Then a dark weaver appeared and with a click of his fingers,
[514.52s -> 522.28s]  three spells from Harry Potter. Beautiful dress. Come child warm yourself he coaxed. So she clothed
[522.28s -> 531.38s]  herself and smiled with joy across waters. The wrong game she went. No, it's not hoping a boat.
[531.38s -> 536.66s]  She found this wrong game. I'm losing my mind. Hungers grip tightened and her heart grew heavy.
[537.30s -> 547.30s]  Then the fish king appeared and offered one of his many fins. Come child. So the girl ate
[548.18s -> 555.54s]  and smiled with joy once more. Continuing on she soon entered the forest dark heart.
[556.50s -> 561.14s]  Then an iron steed appeared bearing a beautiful golden gear.
[561.38s -> 565.94s]  I just wanted to cut to something. He's like nose getting closed in a book and snatched
[565.94s -> 571.38s]  what she thought was another gift. And that's the end of the story. Like right here. The horse grew
[571.38s -> 579.74s]  angry and summoned the other monsters. Terror filled the girl's heart as the wild wind rose
[579.74s -> 591.45s]  around the beast. Suddenly a witch appeared. Dark yet regal. Oh come on. Oh I just the skin
[591.45s -> 596.81s]  came off my mouth. What was that? What's going on? Don't do it to the baby.
[605.53s -> 609.69s]  Babies can't even fucking understand English right now. She's asleep. You literally could
[609.69s -> 614.33s]  have just said banana, carrot, strawberry over and over again. She's only six months old.
[615.45s -> 621.96s]  Woman at the store said it was traditional. A local tale. Besides,
[622.84s -> 626.68s]  Rose doesn't seem to mind. I'm getting a little screen tearing. What's going on 3090?
[626.68s -> 630.54s]  Thank god we moved here so that you wouldn't have to deal with any of that. Remember?
[630.54s -> 632.22s]  You're getting screen tearing. I am. There's nothing wrong with my memory.
[632.86s -> 642.57s]  You're just being paranoid. It's not. I'm sorry. But I'm not paranoid. I'm just cautious.
[643.21s -> 650.86s]  Then go cautiously take your daughter to bed. I heard there's a lot of weird PC problems this
[650.86s -> 660.60s]  game. I don't. I don't. I hate this. I don't like this. If somebody wants me to hold their
[660.60s -> 665.64s]  baby I just I hate to decline but I do because I don't I feel like I'm gonna like break it.
[666.36s -> 671.56s]  I can't blame her. You know what I mean? It's like oh why don't you hold the baby?
[671.56s -> 676.20s]  Like did you say something? Nothing. No I don't think so. How do we hold it?
[676.84s -> 679.88s]  And they teach you oh what you do is you support the head and you put the neck up and you have to
[679.88s -> 685.24s]  make sure that it goes that way you know but rest the bum. It's like I don't I can I just
[685.24s -> 690.36s]  watch you do it? I don't want to fucking do it. All right yeah the graphics are fucking what's
[690.36s -> 697.18s]  going on here? I know look I know I'm not utilizing the extent of the 3090. I'm scared because one of
[697.18s -> 702.54s]  my fans doesn't work. So look look I got 23 gigabytes of available memory but I'm afraid
[702.54s -> 710.47s]  of the fucking overheating. So I turned it down a little. But I need to fix this. Why is it is it
[710.47s -> 715.77s]  v-sync? Can I make my frame rate the same with the refresh rate? Is that the problem? Or should
[715.77s -> 724.25s]  I just turn on v-sync? Why is it doing that? Yes yes but what if it makes the graphics card
[724.25s -> 731.93s]  go faster? Oh that didn't fix it. I'm still getting a bunch of screen tearing. How am I
[731.93s -> 740.82s]  getting screen tearing? I have to turn on v-sync. Doesn't v-sync like give you input lag though? I
[740.82s -> 752.79s]  feel like I'm gonna complain about that. Should I just do it? Well let's see. Yeah I got input lag
[752.79s -> 769.75s]  now. I'll see how I fare for a little while. Sink off. Fuck it up. Okay I'll be fine. Whatever.
[769.75s -> 774.31s]  All right let's go. All right so what do I have to do? Feed the baby? Oh this looks fucking beautiful
[774.31s -> 778.79s]  on a 3090 if I will say. Oh wait you guys can't even see that because I have to I forgot to do
[778.79s -> 786.10s]  that. So like on the next stream I'm gonna up the quality of the stream to like 900p. All right we've
[786.10s -> 799.51s]  got tomato uh bread. Do it now? I can't do it now. It's not gonna work. Does we just eat bread and
[799.51s -> 808.57s]  sauce? Wait what is that? Don't get too close to me when I'm cooking babe. Did you take this? Oh right
[808.57s -> 816.04s]  you've you've you've. Watch out for that splattering hot oil. Is it european diet? Bread,
[816.04s -> 827.56s]  sauce, and apples is european? What are you talking about? What's this? Oh baby food. Mia makes
[827.56s -> 832.52s]  everything by hand so this stuff keeps piling up. I have to change that one. I hate F as I can examine.
[832.52s -> 837.08s]  I'm gonna make it uh one of the mouse buttons maybe. Uh wait we'll see. Give me like 20 minutes
[837.08s -> 853.08s]  we'll see if I hit it. What's the sprint button? How's the audio for you guys? Is it good? All right
[853.08s -> 856.52s]  put the baby to bed. Wait is this um those of you that haven't seen Resident Evil 7 or haven't
[856.52s -> 861.40s]  played Resident Evil 7? I don't have no fucking idea why you're watching this without if you want
[861.40s -> 867.19s]  like this is I'm gonna talk about the 7th game. Is this the house? Is this the the original family's
[867.19s -> 872.55s]  house? They're there. It's like I said to your mom. That book's too scary for you. This is like the original
[872.55s -> 887.85s]  house. That's cool. No it's not. Sure? Turn. Your mom and I love this song so much. Hey two hands,
[887.85s -> 899.38s]  two hands man. It's like a bicycle. Oh my god that's the top of the cake from our wedding day.
[900.18s -> 911.82s]  I think I gotta turn the brightness down. Oh wait I have to kill these. Why do I even keep this
[911.82s -> 917.62s]  around? I should get rid of it someday. These interact with the monkey toy into the spoiler.
[918.42s -> 928.57s]  Gotta do a deep clean before Rose starts walking. Wait is this the baby's sleep? No. I'm not like
[928.57s -> 933.93s]  wait why are we this is like kind of bad. Why am I bringing the baby into like the weird dusty room?
[934.57s -> 939.85s]  Somebody else will read this. Somebody else will read this. I hate reading these. I know people
[939.85s -> 943.61s]  are gonna get so pissed about this but I fucking hate reading these. I just wish somebody would
[943.61s -> 949.53s]  just say it like uh Bioshock. And I mean like just let me just let me pick up a fucking tape
[949.53s -> 955.58s]  and just play it in my ear. Like even Diablo 3 got this right and that game was fucking dog shit.
[956.70s -> 965.82s]  Well for the first year or two. Everyone's forgotten about this already. You wouldn't
[965.82s -> 971.74s]  pay attention anyways. Well at least I mean I've fallen asleep listening to audiobooks and like
[971.74s -> 977.83s]  12 chapters go by and I wake up and I'm like a third of the way through the book. I'm just saying
[977.83s -> 990.20s]  well oh well. All right I have to play with the monkey toy. Wherever the monkey toy is. Almost
[990.20s -> 998.82s]  there honey. I'm gonna get screamed at right? I mean this is I can't do two headphones. No I
[999.06s -> 1006.65s]  have to hear myself talk. That's a cool toy. All right wait wait play with the monkey toy.
[1007.21s -> 1016.97s]  Rose is closed for tomorrow. Can you guys hear me? I think we need to move mic. I don't see a monkey
[1016.97s -> 1046.87s]  toy. Play with the monkey toy? I don't see a monkey toy. Ah I see a monkey toy now. I thought a car
[1046.87s -> 1055.88s]  was gonna hit us. I thought a car was gonna crash into us. I was supposed to scream. I was like what
[1055.88s -> 1069.22s]  the fuck? That is here. Yeah yeah Rosemary Winters. Screenings, hearing, vision, and touch reflex
[1069.22s -> 1076.49s]  are all good. Patience good. You're on the second floor. I don't know we could have gone off a jump.
[1078.76s -> 1082.04s]  Mia and I had another fight. I accidentally mentioned what happened three years ago and
[1082.04s -> 1087.48s]  she blew up at me. We finally settle down in our new life in Europe and can bring Rose up properly.
[1087.48s -> 1091.16s]  But I still feel like a part of me is trapped in that hellhole back in Louisiana. So this is
[1091.16s -> 1097.37s]  talking about the seventh game. I know Mia doesn't like to talk about it but can we really just forget
[1097.37s -> 1102.55s]  everything and pretend it didn't happen? Should we face what happened there so we can live our lives
[1102.55s -> 1107.67s]  with Rose without it hanging over our heads? We owe her that much at least. I know Mia knows this.
[1107.67s -> 1114.90s]  She wouldn't have exploded like that at the hospital if she didn't care. All right let's
[1114.90s -> 1121.90s]  put this kid to bed. Can you keep your mother waiting? She's scary when she's angry. Oh yeah
[1121.90s -> 1128.62s]  didn't she like she like chainsawed my hand off. All right Rose time for bed. There you go sweetheart.
[1128.62s -> 1134.14s]  Don't you worry. I'll be right downstairs. Daddy won't let those weird fairy tale monsters get you.
[1136.95s -> 1143.10s]  We're gonna get Ghostbusters 2'd here. Anybody that saw Ghostbusters 2.
[1143.74s -> 1146.94s]  Like are we is that gonna happen? I feel like that's gonna happen. I feel like that was like
[1148.02s -> 1153.46s]  the guy like oh VEGAL. Like isn't he gonna come and like steal a baby? If you haven't seen Ghostbusters
[1153.46s -> 1168.81s]  2 then what's wrong with you? People in chat aren't old enough for that. I would rather you
[1168.81s -> 1179.78s]  watch Ghostbusters 2 three times in a row than watch this stream right now. Watch out this.
[1179.78s -> 1183.14s]  I'm not gonna say that because that's an actual spoiler. I just went like I just made like a voice.
[1184.26s -> 1197.32s]  All right it's time for dinner. Is she okay? Sleeping like uh is that Mia? Like a baby. That
[1197.32s -> 1203.70s]  smells good. What's that? Oh hands off mister. It's churba de lagoon. It's a local recipe. Wish you
[1203.70s -> 1207.86s]  went like wow you've gone full native haven't you? Like my health bar went down a little.
[1209.56s -> 1213.40s]  But if you're gonna keep sulking all evening maybe you shouldn't have any.
[1215.14s -> 1217.62s]  What we got here? You really have to stop worrying.
[1217.70s -> 1224.02s]  I almost missed. Finding you in Louisiana. The pregnancy. Chris moving us here.
[1224.74s -> 1229.38s]  Military training. It all happened so fast you know. Well at least we're all together.
[1229.38s -> 1237.42s]  No the baby's gonna get VEGO'd. Everything's gonna be- Seriously think we can just forget
[1237.42s -> 1243.48s]  about what happened in Louisiana? It happened so long ago. I just I don't understand why you are so-
[1244.44s -> 1249.32s]  I've told you. Wait what happened? Did you snipe him?
[1252.52s -> 1266.84s]  What the fuck? Wait what? Why is it- Who's doing this? Why would you do this?
[1269.30s -> 1278.60s]  That was at every angle. It's-
[1279.32s -> 1286.81s]  What the hell? Sorry Ethan. No! No you're supposed to be Wesker! Why?
[1302.42s -> 1314.01s]  Go on move. All clear. What the hell you doing with my daughter? Package secured sir. Package
[1314.01s -> 1325.85s]  secured? Take him away. I said get your hands off her! Ethan no. Kills people by the way. I
[1325.85s -> 1334.86s]  never understood why people continue to do that in tv shows. I would be instantly dead if you did
[1334.86s -> 1348.70s]  that to my right into the middle of my head. What is photo mode? Did I have like paused it
[1348.70s -> 1370.17s]  at some point? Well whatever. Who's calling? Hey doc. No problem we'll be there. How's the doc?
[1371.05s -> 1381.40s]  She'll see us next week. Hey now think positively all right? We talked about this. I know.
[1382.12s -> 1390.50s]  We hardly talk about anything else. I keep telling you it's not Rose that I'm worried about. Well
[1390.50s -> 1396.42s]  then what are you worried about? Look she's gonna be fine. I just know it. What else matters?
[1397.06s -> 1404.34s]  We matter Ethan. You matter. You just- Nia what are you talking about?
[1405.06s -> 1413.62s]  Is there something you're not telling me? Come on talk to me. Damn it. Work. I have to take this.
[1417.94s -> 1426.87s]  Shit work is calling. Look at how the fucking 3090 really makes that look real.
[1427.83s -> 1446.50s]  But what happened now? Did we get in a car accident? Why did this happen?
[1448.81s -> 1460.97s]  Oh it's work. Shit I gotta take this. What are you talking about? Where's Chris Redfield and Rose?
[1469.30s -> 1473.30s]  Somebody just like fucking strangled that guy from behind like squished his windpipe.
[1474.10s -> 1482.95s]  Oh no that was where the edibles kicked in. What are you doing here? This is a secure oh boy.
[1483.75s -> 1493.05s]  Eliminate target. Recover body. Secure Rosemary Winters and Ethan Winters. Move the two
[1493.05s -> 1499.72s]  Winterses. Move the two Winterses to site C for further investigation. At least two
[1499.72s -> 1506.98s]  transport officers doing good. Why do they have to kill the girl? Any guns back here?
[1513.11s -> 1531.35s]  I don't think so. All right let's go. Is this 90 FOV? All right. All right fine. I'll put them both in.
[1532.07s -> 1560.78s]  Do I have like light up shoes? Work is calling. Turn the light off. This is why I didn't want
[1560.78s -> 1565.42s]  to start till later in the afternoon because it's fucking it's three o'clock in the afternoon in Las
[1565.42s -> 1570.30s]  Vegas. I this is just sunny out right now. I'm telling you this is why I wanted to start later.
[1570.86s -> 1577.38s]  But that's not why I actually started later. I actually started later because my fans didn't
[1577.38s -> 1585.77s]  work. What was the windows? The windows are closed. I don't have like blackout curtains in my house.
[1597.13s -> 1604.60s]  Oh that's you're gonna have to get a you're gonna have to get a shot for that one. Where the hell am
[1604.60s -> 1625.86s]  I going? Oh shit. Birds. A lot of dead birds everywhere. They're being hung up everywhere.
[1626.74s -> 1635.42s]  Turn the light off. I can't turn the fucking light off. All right somebody tell me is this 90 FOV
[1635.42s -> 1650.20s]  before I like immerse myself in this game or do I have to do something? Is it? Okay do your best.
[1650.20s -> 1659.45s]  No there's not a good fix for it. What? You need a mod. What the fuck are you talking about? What?
[1662.44s -> 1674.79s]  It's 80. It's locked at 80. You have to hack the game. What the fuck are you talking about?
[1676.31s -> 1687.96s]  That's not that can't be real. How is that? How can there not be 90 FOV in a 1920 by 1080 game?
[1688.68s -> 1691.24s]  Like the ability to have it without it being a that doesn't make any sense.
[1696.71s -> 1709.56s]  Mod manager and FOV trainer. Don't restart that. I thought that was said resume.
[1710.20s -> 1720.89s]  I would have. Fuck Capcom. Fuck you Capcom. Capcom sucks. That would I just ruined my game
[1720.89s -> 1725.05s]  experience. That would have like scared me and I would have been like holy shit that was so scary.
[1725.05s -> 1733.34s]  Are you fucking kidding me? You've already ruined my game experience because it's like wow the FOV
[1733.34s -> 1737.10s]  looks weird. We have to hack my video game to do something that should have uh that's been a normal
[1737.10s -> 1747.96s]  thing since like 2012. How does it even happen? How does this even happen? Is how does this happen?
[1749.88s -> 1773.42s]  Is everybody asleep? Meltdown percent. That would have been like a good scare too.
[1784.97s -> 1790.10s]  I'm fucking just almost came out of my nose. The first thing if you're gonna have a game go on PC
[1790.66s -> 1796.26s]  I'm sorry. I have no fucking I have absolutely no sympathy for any of this shit. If a game is
[1796.26s -> 1804.73s]  gonna release on PC and it's after 2008 if you if it's not 90 FOV just throw the whole thing the
[1804.73s -> 1810.17s]  garbage and start over. Like it should not even release. I can't even fucking believe it. Like
[1810.17s -> 1816.87s]  it's so simple. If they just release this for console and just copy and paste the fucking code
[1816.87s -> 1821.67s]  over here. Nobody cares about fucking PC gaming. Everyone thought this was gonna people people
[1821.67s -> 1827.03s]  thought like five years ago man PC gaming people gonna start to care way more about this. Well
[1827.03s -> 1831.75s]  companies are starting to take PC gaming way more seriously. No if they won't give a fuck about this.
[1847.80s -> 1865.51s]  Baby rage. It's true though what the fuck. It's available in photo mode. I can't believe you have
[1865.51s -> 1868.71s]  to hack your fucking game to do something that should be here from like 10 years ago.
[1869.43s -> 1906.86s]  You're whining now. Yeah I am. It's really fucking annoying. Oh is this the big lady?
[1906.86s -> 1920.17s]  It's already 90 FOV. It'd be so funny if it actually was. I hope it is so that I seem like
[1920.17s -> 1944.01s]  a fucking psycho. I really don't think it is though. Is there anything else I can do in here?
[1944.01s -> 1970.62s]  Can I pick this up? Under the bed? Books? Oh fuck okay over here. I can't see anything though.
[1970.62s -> 1989.13s]  Oh don't make me go into the basement. I thought that was a sausage. It's a banana.
[1989.13s -> 2033.51s]  Oh wait I wasn't done. It's pretty creepy. What's that? There's something in there. All right I'm
[2033.51s -> 2044.70s]  ready. I'm ready. Here comes one two three. It's gonna jump out. It's gonna be behind me. I grab
[2044.70s -> 2047.50s]  the broom and just turn around. I thought right now I grab this broom and I turn around. I just
[2047.50s -> 2053.26s]  start swinging as hard as I can. If any like horror games and horror movies have taught me anything
[2053.82s -> 2058.62s]  it's that just grab this and just just turn and swing as hard as you fucking can in a circle.
[2059.18s -> 2082.65s]  Damn it there's nothing here. Okay I knew it. Is that the rat? Is the rat doing that?
[2093.61s -> 2134.98s]  Hey! Hey! Hey! What's in all this? All right give me a weapon. I need a weapon. I need a chair. I
[2134.98s -> 2143.37s]  need a stick. I need a like a rake or something. Give me a rake. There's gotta be something right?
[2148.76s -> 2166.18s]  Rake? Run? Or a gun? Yeah I mean I was I'll take a gun but I'll take something just a rake or
[2166.18s -> 2192.02s]  something just to start. Where the hell am I? Wow this looks really cool. All right I did I may
[2192.02s -> 2198.62s]  have said fuck Capcom earlier. I want to just correct that. Fuck Capcom for this particular
[2198.62s -> 2201.50s]  instance. I love Resident Evil 2. It's like one of my favorite games the last five years.
[2218.34s -> 2224.57s]  I need to like get my emotions under control. I really am like Donald Duck.
[2227.26s -> 2234.34s]  I connect so strongly with him. I don't know I just like I get so just so frustrated. Oh look at
[2234.34s -> 2255.21s]  that poor miserable duck. I can't stand! He starts eating plates and shit. Okay there's like a stable.
[2256.44s -> 2261.24s]  Is this is this the big lady? Is this the introduction to the big lady? Even like a
[2261.24s -> 2273.02s]  is a big lady a bad character? Is it like a quest giver? Let's need some okay I need something to
[2273.02s -> 2288.33s]  to pull the well up. I got in here. Oh so there's some manure. I need a pulley to pull the well up.
[2288.97s -> 2317.72s]  Erin Erin. All right pull. I'm looking for like something to put maybe back here. Okay um
[2318.28s -> 2325.70s]  over here. Is that a horse? Is that a horse statue or is that a dead horse?
[2326.42s -> 2331.34s]  I kind of it's hard to tell. I think that's a statue of a horse.
[2331.98s -> 2349.05s]  I'll be sleeping in that bed. Maybe maybe they're out. An easy to pick lock. All right well let's
[2349.05s -> 2358.36s]  go. Let me do it. Is this tuber commentary? Oh what? Because I'm like wait somebody's still
[2358.36s -> 2391.13s]  making food here. I'll be sleeping in that bed. Oh it's that thing again. All right nothing in
[2391.13s -> 2402.36s]  here. Tuber reactions. Tuber gameplay. Why can I pick it? Do I need a lock pick? I don't have
[2402.36s -> 2422.54s]  anything. Oh no. Oh shit. Tuber. You're talking like a tuber. Hey this is just my normal speaking
[2422.54s -> 2427.86s]  voice man. What are you talking about? Is it because I'm playing a game that came out like a
[2427.86s -> 2443.18s]  week ago? Is that why everybody's saying this? I mean it looks great. It really does. Capcom.
[2443.82s -> 2447.42s]  App. Just out doing yourselves. Art direction. Phenomenal. Graphics. Unbelievable.
[2448.06s -> 2468.84s]  How did he just crashed it? Pick up that fucking rake. Pick something. Pick up a weapon man.
[2470.33s -> 2479.56s]  One of these rocks will do. Fuck Capcom. I didn't play the game for five minutes and I already just
[2479.56s -> 2500.07s]  said that. Don't worry I'll patch it in in three months. Locked due to missing homeowner. It's
[2500.07s -> 2519.42s]  locked. It's got one of those things on it okay. I believe this is where we need to go. Ah there's
[2519.42s -> 2534.84s]  a knife. Okay finally a weapon. Knife. Attack. Is it like a block? What am I hitting? Am I stabbing
[2534.84s -> 2553.62s]  myself in the stomach? They don't you don't get a knife and then not fight something. Nothing okay.
[2553.62s -> 2568.04s]  Here we go. Friendly. Friendly. How did he miss? Who are you? Who sent you? How did you miss? There
[2568.04s -> 2581.02s]  was an accident down the road. He shot me in point blank and missed. He looks like Ernest. One second.
[2586.79s -> 2591.67s]  Who is? What the hell was that? Do you have a gun? What? Please tell me you have a gun.
[2592.39s -> 2611.22s]  No why would I? Well give me yours. You can't seem to aim with it. Take it. Take it. Dude you
[2611.22s -> 2615.06s]  stopped shooting the gun. Are you listening? Stop shooting your weapon. You have no idea
[2615.06s -> 2624.57s]  what you're doing. This guy sucks. This guy sucks. Oh my god that guy was awful. Can I get his gun?
[2628.07s -> 2658.84s]  Shit. Dead body. He did his best. Wait there's more. Okay I kind of I want to toggle. I want to
[2658.84s -> 2669.93s]  toggle. I want to toggle for controls please. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go.
[2675.90s -> 2682.62s]  Uh I want toggle. Is there a why would there be a toggle for like aim downsides right? It has to be
[2682.62s -> 2702.02s]  though right? Zoom in and out. Aim. No there's no. Why would there be a toggle? Of course there's
[2702.02s -> 2712.39s]  not. Why would there be a toggle? I like toggle. It's easier to do. Easier to use. Because then
[2712.39s -> 2718.86s]  you don't have to like depress down my middle finger. I know people think it's bad but whatever.
[2718.86s -> 2746.23s]  I like it. What the hell is wrong with this place? There's somebody there. Holy shit.
[2747.03s -> 2757.99s]  Shit. This guy keeps losing his hand. What the fuck was that? All right let's shoot him.
[2758.55s -> 2782.54s]  Shoot him. Space is guard? What? I could have just shot him to hit free time. These guys take a lot
[2782.54s -> 2789.93s]  of shots. Oh my god these are all headshots. Like every single one of those is a headshot. Every
[2789.93s -> 2801.62s]  single one. Holy shit that's a lot of time to shoot. What the hell? All right so don't use weapons
[2801.62s -> 2807.34s]  that often. Okay one is. Okay two. Do I have a flashlight? No why would I have a flashlight?

[2817.77s -> 2823.77s]  is chem fluid and herb. It looks like they got rid of anything besides green. Like just green herbs.
[2824.33s -> 2837.62s]  See items. Family photo. Treasure. Okay let's go. Everything gives you ammo. There it is. All right
[2837.62s -> 2844.10s]  so herb. I don't think this looks like this. Just all right. Craft first aid. Excuse me. Get
[2844.10s -> 2871.96s]  out of the way. First aid. Okay do it. I made a first aid kit. Okay that. Do I have it? One and
[2871.96s -> 2882.94s]  collect the item to craft. Did I already do it? Okay am I losing my mind here? I've already made
[2882.94s -> 2896.86s]  it. Well it wasn't really. It wasn't like a good indicator. I don't need to use it. Not pretending.
[2896.86s -> 2903.06s]  Well I just. I didn't see. I don't have key to open this. This needs some kind of key.
[2909.70s -> 2925.21s]  He sucks. I don't. Does this guy have anything on him? Wait can I shoot this lock? Is it even the lock?
[2927.03s -> 2939.30s]  No. There's gonna be another one of those guys. All right bolt cutters. Here we go. Yeah let's go.

[2947.74s -> 2978.26s]  this game six days late. You already know where the bolt cutters are. I don't. Cool. I gotta. Okay
[2978.26s -> 2989.19s]  is ammo really a problem in this game like it is in every single one of these games?
[2989.19s -> 3002.14s]  Yes. Oh god. Somebody gonna run down the stairs. Handgun ammo. Open inventory. Okay. Yes. I was
[3002.14s -> 3006.86s]  just discarded. Okay. It just. You have a huge inventory in this game. That's good.

[3077.88s -> 3114.42s]  Or do I get him off? Fuck. I'm gonna die. What the hell? Why did I try to put three in there?
[3117.16s -> 3121.67s]  Is it over? He's taking three clips. Like oh shit. Which one?
[3126.46s -> 3130.62s]  Oh for the legs. Not for the head. God damn it. I didn't mean to do that. My
[3130.62s -> 3154.02s]  my mouse is really sensitive. Big lady. Survivors. It's the big lady. Go to the house near the field.
[3154.02s -> 3163.05s]  Okay. Those aren't any kind of standard zombie. Those things. Usually. Okay. Every Resident Evil
[3163.05s -> 3168.49s]  game has done this before. The first enemy you face is just a standard zombie. These guys are
[3168.49s -> 3179.45s]  very very quick. Okay. Go to the big field. Where should I go over? Oh my god. Okay.
[3180.17s -> 3191.34s]  I don't think this is the right way. I wish I had a flashlight so I could see anything.
[3191.98s -> 3200.58s]  First enemy in Resident Evil 7 is your wife. Yeah but it's really it's pretty scripted.
[3202.89s -> 3224.86s]  I can't break this. I don't even. Wait. Hold on. I gotta I gotta make another uh how many items do I
[3224.86s -> 3239.51s]  have? Got it. You missed the shotgun. Stop stop stop. This part sucks. What? What do you mean

[3253.56s -> 3268.90s]  had a map. Why would I have a map of this place? I just got like dumped here. You missed the
[3268.90s -> 3272.90s]  shotgun. Go back. Did I really miss the shotgun? Why would they give you? No. I don't I don't
[3272.90s -> 3279.35s]  actually don't believe you guys. Why would you get a shotgun this early? I can't even leave.
[3280.07s -> 3296.09s]  I'm stuck here. I can only go one way. Don't help him. I don't I really don't think there's
[3296.09s -> 3317.86s]  a shotgun. I think you're full of shit. Oh my god. I mean run. What? Oh my god. What did I do?
[3317.86s -> 3321.30s]  What did I do? What happened to me? Damn it. What did I do that for? I gotta run.

[3363.78s -> 3366.98s]  Oh I can blow up. Why why do they think I can blow up the flower by shooting it?
[3367.70s -> 3385.37s]  Can I go down? There's no end to them. Why do you what? What's that? Rusted scrap. I don't want to
[3385.37s -> 3400.23s]  miss any items. I don't know. Wait. I need to look at the map. Straight up here. Scrap metals for hats.
[3401.19s -> 3406.18s]  Oh. Let me in. Let me in. Let me in. Let me in.
[3416.12s -> 3421.90s]  I want whatever fell on the ground. I want. I want what fell on the ground. I want what fell.
[3421.90s -> 3452.98s]  Close the door. That's. That is explosive flower. I want to shoot it. Oh my god. What the fuck is
[3452.98s -> 3459.78s]  happening? Where am I supposed to go? Survive? What? Where? They're shooting arrows at me. What
[3459.78s -> 3466.22s]  the fuck is this? Legolas bullshit. What is happening to this? Who's firing arrows?
[3469.11s -> 3493.77s]  What the fuck is this? Oh my god. How am I getting up here? Oh my god. Get back down.
[3496.52s -> 3522.76s]  Oh my god. It's a huge guy. What's this? Oh my god. What's this? Money? How do I?
[3524.02s -> 3533.13s]  Am I safe in here? I think I'm safe in here. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
[3538.38s -> 3569.70s]  Jump from roof to roof? Get out of my way. Get. Fuck. Who am I? I guess we're going this way.
[3569.70s -> 3635.19s]  Oh my god. Am I dead? White blockers from Game of Thrones. I want to zoom in. It's a perfect
[3635.19s -> 3641.78s]  picture. All right. Go in. How do I zoom in? Adjust the scope of the camera. Area of view. I
[3641.78s -> 3659.93s]  can't do anything with this. No depth of field. Here we go. Okay. Okay. Filters. Oh my god. I'm
[3659.93s -> 3673.11s]  going to get an Instagram filter. Okay. Lens distortion. No, none of that. Frames and logos.
[3673.11s -> 3687.77s]  Game. I don't know. Other. Grid. Off. Okay. Now what? Did I get it? Did I take the picture?
[3689.24s -> 3705.00s]  I guess I took it. At a heart. That's so stupid. Imagine this is what they were using as their
[3705.00s -> 3733.74s]  like PR shit. Frame type. That's perfect. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I like this one. It's a book
[3733.74s -> 3752.01s]  cover. It kind of is a book cover, isn't it? It really is a book cover. I can't change any
[3752.01s -> 3765.66s]  of this stuff though. All right. So I got it, right? Nice lock screen. So how do I take the
[3765.66s -> 3793.00s]  picture? I got it, right? I got it. I think I hit, I pressed F. Yeah, I got it. No, I, okay. No,
[3793.00s -> 3803.27s]  no, no. Now that I know that exists, I'm going to abuse it. All right. This is way too loud,
[3803.27s -> 3827.10s]  by the way. I have to turn it down. This is Mario Odyssey's camera, but worse. Is this a sleigh?
[3827.90s -> 3843.46s]  Why? Oh, why? It was a sleigh. I'm trying to kill that motherfucker.
[3855.34s -> 3859.59s]  Monster. Oh, I can't open this. It has one of those things. All right. I got to remember these
[3859.59s -> 3863.11s]  because this is important. The keys. I'm going to have to open them later. Backtracking Barry.
[3863.91s -> 3866.95s]  I'm not coming over there yet. Let me make sure. Let me like loot the place.
[3867.75s -> 3876.58s]  You're going to be sitting there for a few minutes, lady, because there was a bunch of
[3876.58s -> 3882.47s]  shit that I didn't get. I can just go get it now. And without all the chaos that was ridiculous,
[3882.47s -> 3891.40s]  that was absolute chaos. Did I miss anything? All right. Let me check. You're a loot goblin.
[3891.40s -> 3894.44s]  Well, look, I mean, it's important. I want to make sure I have like items and shit.
[3895.72s -> 3898.20s]  That doesn't waste the clip, right? Because I know that happens in some games.
[3901.45s -> 3904.25s]  Anything else I'm missing? All right. Yeah. Flower. Like, what's this for?
[3905.72s -> 3914.78s]  All right. So what it was, I don't know why, what that was for. That doesn't do anything.
[3914.78s -> 3922.31s]  The map would literally tell you if you finished an area. Oh, sir. Okay. Search completed. I get it.
[3922.31s -> 3927.14s]  All right. Well, that's new. That didn't happen before. Yes, it did. That was in all the Resident
[3927.14s -> 3950.04s]  Evil games. All right, we go back to the Jingle Bell lady. That's the big lady. Um, no, it's not.
[3951.48s -> 3966.44s]  Big lady goes like this. Hello. You shouldn't be out here. It's not safe. Hey, can you hear me?
[3967.08s -> 3983.29s]  It's you, the child's father. Hey, wait, do you mean Rose? She is in great danger.
[3983.29s -> 3988.58s]  No, since mother Miranda brought her to the village, we have fought this.
[3988.58s -> 3993.35s]  I'm trying to get like, uh, the monsters. I want to get her going like this
[3994.15s -> 3997.51s]  and then put make like a YouTuber thumbnail. Harold's danger.
[3998.50s -> 4018.26s]  I mean, I could have clearly just pointed the gun at this lady and been like,
[4018.26s -> 4022.82s]  tell me what's going, tell me what you know. Like I'm like, I have a gun and like,
[4022.82s -> 4026.02s]  you're like this weird witch person. Like I will shoot you. Just tell me what,
[4026.02s -> 4053.38s]  tell me what's going on. I have weapons. Like, where the fuck am I? You're a psycho.
[4053.38s -> 4058.10s]  I'm assigned to psycho. I just got literally attacked by all these people that were just
[4058.10s -> 4062.50s]  trying to kill me and bite my hand off and shit. This is not a regular place.
[4062.50s -> 4066.18s]  This is like, shit's going down here. People are killing you and eating you.
[4066.18s -> 4074.42s]  What the fuck? I thought I just grabbed it. It's Q. May they come to eat our flesh. May
[4074.42s -> 4077.06s]  they come to tear us apart. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to read that. And then what?
[4077.06s -> 4085.02s]  I'm not supposed to like carry my gun. A guy with a sledgehammer just jumped from a ceiling,
[4085.02s -> 4100.49s]  like 40 foot story and was swinging it at me and easy to pick locks. Shit. I want to get in there.
[4100.49s -> 4111.59s]  I don't know what made me just think about this. I'm just going to say it because I don't know why
[4111.59s -> 4115.67s]  I'm thinking it, but I've just, I was thinking it for some reason right now. Chewing gum is really
[4115.67s -> 4119.19s]  gross. Chewing gum. I hate the most. I don't know why that was. I don't know what that's from.
[4119.19s -> 4131.46s]  It's from Billy Wonka. It's still somehow it's cause I don't know why I had to say that,
[4131.46s -> 4145.86s]  but I just did. Why V? It's M. Look for Rose. Okay. Sure. We will. I move around. All right.
[4145.86s -> 4151.14s]  This is where I am. So this door is locked. I didn't search this whole place, but let's just
[4151.14s -> 4164.01s]  keep going. The vitamin B just kicked in. Oh, wait. No. Damn it. Okay. Well, there's two of those.
[4164.65s -> 4179.77s]  You never know what could be under the car. You're high on turmeric. Let's check and open
[4179.77s -> 4185.98s]  this door. Can I even go in here? No. You have a front door. What about this thing?
[4186.54s -> 4195.70s]  Ever? Okay. I just want to make sure I don't miss anything. I'm trying to complete the game.
[4196.26s -> 4205.34s]  Castle Dimetri Sioux. Well, that's where the big lady is. I know that's what the character's name
[4205.34s -> 4215.67s]  is. Talk from the other side. All right. All right. Let's just go. Let's just go get the
[4215.67s -> 4222.70s]  introduction. We're going to get like a, like an interesting, like violin, like piano mix.
[4222.70s -> 4225.26s]  She's going to waltz in like, Oh, hello. It's going to be like,
[4230.95s -> 4233.19s]  it's going to be like a violin and shit. It's going to be cool. I can't wait.
[4236.38s -> 4247.88s]  Oh, darling. I bet she says darling at least two or three times. I guess this leads to the castle.
[4247.88s -> 4256.30s]  All right. I need to find that thing and that thing. There's two circle depressions there.
[4256.30s -> 4280.63s]  Let's check out in here. What is that? Ooh, there's one of them. Ooh, what the hell? Oh,
[4280.63s -> 4293.32s]  type right up. Good thing my game didn't like crash. Something's still in here. What is still
[4293.32s -> 4299.74s]  in here? Ooh, disaster fall upon the village. Seek out the crests. One is in the care of the
[4299.74s -> 4314.50s]  church. The other is at Louisa's house. Okay. Louisa's house. Got it. So Louisa's house is
[4316.65s -> 4321.62s]  down here at Louisa's house. Which one of these is Louisa's house? Probably this one or probably
[4321.62s -> 4330.62s]  that one. This one or here. So we need to go that way. Go back. It's not fully explored.
[4331.58s -> 4359.85s]  Shit. What did I miss? How's this not fully explored? Look up. Crystal fragment. Treasure.
[4359.85s -> 4368.18s]  Whoa. I got a treasure. White mineral found in this region could probably sell it. Valuable.
[4368.18s -> 4373.62s]  Oh, shit. That's cool. Now. Ah, all right. Good. Good. I'm making money.
[4374.84s -> 4380.63s]  Fuck you, chat. What? Look at the map. Yeah, I know. Find a way to open the castle gate. Yeah.
[4380.63s -> 4388.04s]  So I have to go to this place. This place has keys and shit. All right. Let me go over there.
[4390.58s -> 4399.54s]  Making money. What? Explore everything. I don't want to miss anything, guys.
[4400.89s -> 4410.02s]  Another one of these wells that I can't use. Stop helping him. I want him to lose. See how
[4410.02s -> 4414.34s]  many headshots I got in a row. And by the way, that first part I've heard was very difficult.
[4415.14s -> 4432.70s]  I did it. I only had to use one healing potion. Okay. How many bullets in the shotgun? No, I don't.
[4432.70s -> 4442.34s]  All right. I got to be smart about this. Oh my God. They're running through. What is this?
[4442.34s -> 4450.31s]  What is this? Corn or wheat? What is this? Oh, God. He's right there. Um, can I jump over this?
[4451.03s -> 4455.85s]  All right. Just a, it's like blinding. I think the flower blinds them.
[4456.41s -> 4465.82s]  If I would take a wild guess. Here we go. All right. Reload this shit right now.
[4466.46s -> 4494.82s]  Well, how many arms do I have? Perhaps some ammo. Ammo. Gunpowder and rusted scrap.
[4495.46s -> 4512.79s]  Did I have wasted that? Did I waste it? Shit. Well, whatever. I'm going. Can't jump over this?
[4517.88s -> 4531.30s]  How do you not jump over that? I don't, how are you that can't jump over that? Okay. Here we go.
[4533.75s -> 4594.57s]  Ouch. My foot. Oh, I hate when they do that move. I step on his head. Yeah. I'm getting too close.
[4595.29s -> 4613.62s]  You think so? Ammo. Make it good. So much ammo. Just use the one. Okay. I want to go this way.
[4614.18s -> 4635.18s]  He thinks he's playing resident evil four. Do I? I got two heels. Oh, I'm not going to heal.
[4635.18s -> 4640.71s]  Why would I heal right now? I feel like there's something in the middle of that field.
[4647.37s -> 4652.22s]  Yeah. He's eating something. What is he eating? Should I just kill him? Will he notice me if I
[4652.22s -> 4673.38s]  don't do anything weird? Who the fuck is this? What? What? It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.
[4673.46s -> 4677.62s]  I'm just glad to see normal people at last. Have you seen any other survivors?
[4679.99s -> 4684.23s]  They're all in Louisa's house and she's not answering and the gate is locked.
[4684.23s -> 4696.46s]  Quiet. He's an outsider. Oh shit. We're sitting ducks in here. Can your old man walk?
[4697.91s -> 4704.20s]  No, one of the monsters cut him. He's lost a lot of blood. We have to get into Louisa's house.
[4704.20s -> 4707.64s]  Quiet. Fucking alone. We're going to kill us. Let's be away inside.
[4707.64s -> 4712.12s]  When the outsider is sus. Be quiet. Don't move until I get those gates open.
[4712.28s -> 4715.08s]  My eyes just rolled back in my head and I think it caused permanent damage to them.
[4720.28s -> 4733.05s]  Can I have that? I'll trade you a knife for that. Okay. They're all in their own Louisa's house.
[4733.05s -> 4754.47s]  It's down here. I don't know. Good ammo. I need it. What is that? Well, gunpowder. Nice. All right.
[4755.53s -> 4761.88s]  On the roof. Take on the roof. When are we going to see the big sus lady? I don't know.
[4768.12s -> 4789.59s]  Oh, this is Louisa's house. Let's go. And no. Out of one of the crests is in there.
[4789.59s -> 4792.63s]  I could probably open it. What? I could probably open it by removing a screw.
[4793.27s -> 4796.87s]  Okay. I need like, I need a screwdriver. There's definitely a screwdriver in this house.
[4800.71s -> 4808.04s]  By the way, how does it look with the 3090? Did you get those two inside?
[4811.78s -> 4817.58s]  Looks like shit. Looks like total dog shit. Come on. It's clear.
[4818.06s -> 4827.78s]  Hurry. Took your damn time. You're welcome.
[4832.23s -> 4834.87s]  You have an RTX on? No, because I'm afraid of overheating it.
[4835.59s -> 4843.43s]  Because one of my fans in the front of the case doesn't work. We'll be safe in here. Won't we?
[4844.15s -> 4850.31s]  Safer here than out there. That's for sure. Hey, do you know anything about what's going on around
[4850.31s -> 4857.02s]  here? It doesn't make any sense. Mother Miranda has always protected us. Nobody's answer.
[4860.94s -> 4875.14s]  Father, we have to get inside. Audio cut off. Just hold on a bit longer, Papa.
[4875.14s -> 4887.66s]  The audio. All right, we have to get inside. Hello? Anybody home? Maybe a familiar voice.
[4888.78s -> 4897.32s]  Louisa, open up. It's me, Elena. Stop shouting. You'll draw the monsters.
[4897.32s -> 4900.44s]  I thought it was the same guy. Who's this? A friend. Stay back.
[4902.28s -> 4906.52s]  I thought it was the shotgun guy. No, they'll smell the blood. You'll endanger us all.
[4908.04s -> 4913.05s]  And no sudden movements. I learned how to aim from my father. Hold Ernest.
[4914.65s -> 4923.08s]  I would just run at him if I heard that. Go on. Go inside. Come now. This way. You're not from this
[4923.08s -> 4939.88s]  village. No, I'm Ethan. Julian, go make yourself useful and check the grounds. I said go. If Elena
[4939.88s -> 4951.62s]  trusts you, then so do I. Come inside, Ethan. Where's the huge lady? I'll check on the others.
[4956.98s -> 4964.79s]  They're gonna eat me. They're broken again. Got more of the livestock. I don't think we'll make
[4964.79s -> 4976.90s]  it through winter at this rate. Ernest is still... You guys know Ernest? Ernest is still missing too.
[4976.90s -> 4987.90s]  We can't find him anywhere. Has Mother Miranda abandoned us? Are you kidding me? Okay, whatever.
[4991.78s -> 4994.90s]  Did it tell me that before and I just... No, I don't think so.
[4995.62s -> 5013.06s]  Rotate your saves. Yeah, I will. Hold on. Let me look at this. Can I get a closer look? Oh,
[5013.06s -> 5027.53s]  whatever. These nice photos. Whatever. I don't care. Right this way. Who are the presidents?
[5028.09s -> 5034.42s]  Two presidents on the wall. Come inside. The others are waiting.
[5039.13s -> 5044.01s]  Outsiders, you're gonna get us all killed. He helped Leonardo and Elena.
[5044.49s -> 5052.87s]  We ourselves? Please, Ethan. Take a seat. Emergency meeting. Right in the front of that table.
[5052.87s -> 5062.81s]  I don't like that guy. In your entire village? All that's... There is no one. A worthless
[5062.81s -> 5072.36s]  invalid. A stupid, wailing bitch. And you! You drag a bloody man and an outsider in here like
[5072.36s -> 5077.16s]  it's nothing? I don't know. And expect to be all safe? They're all like around a table. There is no
[5077.24s -> 5093.77s]  safe. Sorry bastard out there has been ripped in half. Just like her damn husband.
[5094.65s -> 5100.97s]  Put a sock in it, Roxana. That's enough. This house has protected my family for generations.
[5101.69s -> 5111.88s]  And drunk or not, you are all welcome and safe in here. Whatever. Can someone please tell me
[5111.88s -> 5119.16s]  what the hell is going on here? We don't know. One day we were a quiet, devout village and the next
[5119.16s -> 5127.91s]  the monsters came and attacked us. And they kept coming. Wait, Louisa. Where is your husband?
[5128.79s -> 5139.98s]  Did they? No. No, he is out there. Somewhere. He went to get help. Yes, yes, that's...
[5140.54s -> 5144.38s]  I feel like this is an elaborate escape room that I like paid a bunch of money to do.
[5144.38s -> 5163.46s]  Let us pray. For him. For all of us. Good idea. Like, oh! I was gonna start clicking the lights.
[5163.46s -> 5172.02s]  Hear our voice, together as one in reverence. We call on thee, within the endless dark,
[5172.02s -> 5178.74s]  to deliver us into fate's hands. As the midnight moon rises on black wings,
[5179.38s -> 5189.77s]  so we make our sacrifice. Or stand up. In life and in death, we give you glory,
[5190.71s -> 5198.17s]  Mother Miranda. Now, the tea should be ready. The alien's gonna come out of that guy. Come help me,
[5198.17s -> 5202.33s]  Elena, please. This guy's gonna... He's gonna punch her inside of his chest. I've heard it before.
[5202.33s -> 5212.97s]  There was an old woman near the graveyard. Crazy as a bag of rice. There is wisdom
[5213.61s -> 5218.47s]  in her devotion, though. And I hope it protected her, as it shall protect us.
[5234.89s -> 5241.21s]  Sorry. I thought... I thought the fucking monster was gonna come out of him.
[5241.21s -> 5248.06s]  So I was trying to time the photo. I'm sorry. Whatever.
[5255.77s -> 5296.60s]  I got it! How do I move the camera? This guy's face over here. Filters. Oh, wow, that's scary.
[5296.60s -> 5330.10s]  I don't like any of these. Yellow? This looks like a loading screen for this game. Turn the grid off.
[5330.10s -> 5336.81s]  Okay. All right, that looks good. Why can I not change the camera shit? Adjust the scope of the
[5336.81s -> 5350.65s]  camera. What's going on here? And now, control, hide HUD. F. Photo. It's because it's a cut scene.
[5350.65s -> 5361.85s]  Oh, okay. All right, cool. F. Got it. When I hit escape, is this just gonna...
[5362.73s -> 5399.30s]  I gotta be ready for this. I missed that second one. It's why I blocked! I hit the block button!
[5409.67s -> 5413.91s]  All right, I have to stop doing this. Why did you tell me I could do this? I know. I'm done.
[5413.91s -> 5418.31s]  I'm not doing it anymore. No more. I'm done. I'm not doing this ever again. I promise I'm not
[5418.31s -> 5424.28s]  gonna do it again. Ever again. I swear to God. I promise. I'm not gonna do it again. I'm done.
[5424.28s -> 5435.83s]  It's over. Don't even do it. I wanted the shotgun to shoot him in the face. Yeah, I didn't do it. See?
[5436.47s -> 5446.68s]  I'm so sorry, father. Hey, hey, that wasn't your father anymore. You did the right thing.
[5451.72s -> 5457.72s]  Was he infected? I don't get it. There's nothing you can do. This entire place is collapsing.
[5460.52s -> 5471.86s]  We couldn't save him. He was already gone. Leave me alone. No, we're getting out of here together.
[5474.09s -> 5483.62s]  We gotta get out of here. Escape. All right, this is where the escape room happens.
[5484.82s -> 5494.25s]  Oh my God. This is so scary. Whoa, what's that? Hey, hey, there's a five? There's a five written
[5494.25s -> 5504.17s]  on the ceiling. Write that down. Under the car. I got a seven over here on the tire.
[5507.14s -> 5515.53s]  Maybe there's a padlock. Oh, wait, this is the house that was from the beginning of the game.
[5515.53s -> 5534.66s]  Whoa, that's a lot of money. I'll take 500 bucks. Why not? Take the screwdriver out of the key ring
[5534.66s -> 5539.10s]  if you need it. I'm really, you know, this company, this escape room company, they leave
[5539.10s -> 5563.03s]  little helpful, helpful clues. Truck key. Examine items. I examine. What is that? Damn it. I was so
[5563.03s -> 5578.97s]  hoping like a four was going to be written on this key for some reason. Oh well. Okay,
[5578.97s -> 5585.18s]  I got the screwdriver. What else we got here? Shotgun ammo. Let me make sure it's loaded.
[5586.30s -> 5603.61s]  One, two. Good. This has been explored. Let's check this side. Cool. Oh, I'm not going up
[5603.61s -> 5605.61s]  there yet. I think there's something in here. Yeah, there's something in here.
[5607.85s -> 5617.98s]  Something. There's a fire in here, but wait a minute. What about here? Come on. There's
[5617.98s -> 5637.54s]  gotta be like one of those shining things, right? A jewel? What the fuck? It's like that's a jewel
[5637.54s -> 5652.14s]  right there, isn't it? Isn't that a jewel? Shit. Where is this? There's something in here.
[5656.15s -> 5662.20s]  Oh, here we go. If we could just get through this wall. No, no, I can't. Whatever. If I,
[5662.20s -> 5684.65s]  if I, if I can't, whatever. Audit plant. Nice. Oh shit. We're like fucking dying.
[5685.53s -> 5692.68s]  All right. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. All right. Let's go. Let's go.
[5692.68s -> 5723.91s]  Let's go. Go. Go get in. Get in the car. Stop reading chat. No. Hit the gas. Well,
[5723.91s -> 5746.17s]  that didn't work. Are we driving up the stairs? Did I think this was a Bugs Bunny cartoon? What
[5746.17s -> 5764.98s]  the fuck am I doing? Wait, what? The car? Oh, grab on. Hurry. You know, the craziest thing
[5764.98s -> 5772.30s]  probably could have used this car or something. Let's move and try not to breathe in the smoke.
[5773.02s -> 5784.42s]  I know. Thank you. All right. Move. I do too. Move. Move. Help me move this. Maybe you'll get to
[5785.14s -> 5792.38s]  meet them. This guy's fucking clumped. He's like Mr. Magoo.
[5808.57s -> 5808.97s]  Window.
[5828.54s -> 5839.50s]  Don't press P. I was hoping he was going to do the thing with like the stunt man. Wait.
[5853.46s -> 5858.68s]  Don't hit P. Don't hit P. I'm going to hit P. I'm going to hit P. I'm going to
[5870.54s -> 5874.97s]  rip P off the keyboard. I'm going to rip P off. I'm going to rip P off the keyboard, I think.
[5874.97s -> 5883.30s]  I won't stop. I have to take P off the keyboard, I think. I'm so annoyed with myself that I'm
[5883.30s -> 5887.78s]  doing that. No more. Don't do that shit anymore. It's not fucking funny. Don't do it anymore. You
[5887.78s -> 5894.22s]  don't fucking do that anymore, right? All right. All right. Don't fucking do it anymore. I just
[5894.94s -> 5915.10s]  don't get it. Let's go. Jump. This place is going mad. Why the fuck is this happening again?
[5915.10s -> 5923.46s]  Oh, what the fuck? Shit. That would have been awesome if that like cratered with his fist and
[5923.46s -> 5927.46s]  like the wood bent and broke and made like an explosion sound. He figured out that he had like
[5927.46s -> 5950.01s]  fucking powers. Capcom, what have you done? Hey. All right. I got to get the thing out of here.
[5953.14s -> 5958.26s]  Use the screwdriver. I'm really low on health. I need a save point too. This is not,
[5958.26s -> 5976.36s]  this is kind of getting ugly. Okay. Let's go in the castle. I used to just get this. When I
[5976.36s -> 5981.24s]  used to play like PUBG on my mobile device, you would hear that and you'd just be like,
[5981.88s -> 5990.54s]  where is this guy? He's fucking like 500 miles away. And I would stand still and he would still
[5990.54s -> 5997.98s]  miss. And that's how I knew if he was shooting at me, right? I didn't even care if I lost or died.
[5997.98s -> 6000.94s]  If I was standing still and I didn't get hit, then he was aiming at somebody else
[6005.82s -> 6007.50s]  and he doesn't even potentially even see me.
[6008.30s -> 6023.88s]  Who's there? What was that?
[6027.66s -> 6033.58s]  Chills. Anything else I missed? I have explored pretty much everything.
[6035.02s -> 6039.75s]  Although the plot. No, that, okay. I thought that was telling me like to go this way because the
[6039.75s -> 6056.01s]  plot is that way to like keep the story going. These guys are all dead, right? I need a typewriter.
[6070.71s -> 6081.64s]  Dad has visited them all.
[6093.94s -> 6106.36s]  This is just a MOBA character select screen. That's the one line and then she's sitting there
[6106.36s -> 6115.45s]  doing her little animation. And like the fucking stadium is screaming because they can't believe
[6115.45s -> 6122.44s]  that. Like, wow. What a counterpick. This is a low tier character. I'm getting too out of control
[6122.44s -> 6145.51s]  here. Oh, that's wrong. Wait, where is this? Oh, out here. Yeah. Death. Death.
[6156.79s -> 6171.00s]  Hey, get in there. Seth, behind you. Oh, it's Otto. What's the matter? Do you need something, Otto?
[6177.77s -> 6188.06s]  What is it? You see his tail? What is it? What is it? Hey, come over here. They can't see you.
[6188.78s -> 6193.05s]  Hold on. Let me just make sure I have pants on. Come here.
[6194.50s -> 6217.61s]  I can see you on cam. And when he's running out, he was like, fuck Capcom. I was like, wow,
[6217.61s -> 6228.25s]  holy shit, dude. What happened? Why did he even say that? What was that for? It was kind of rude.
[6228.25s -> 6236.49s]  It's like they make good games and shit. All right. Let me in. Here we go. We're going to meet
[6236.49s -> 6248.52s]  lady of the castle. Can't wait for the nothing but blood and death. And she's probably going to go
[6248.52s -> 6270.82s]  like this and like cool herself off of it. Right. It's just cord. It's cords going. Is that
[6270.82s -> 6279.38s]  electricity? Am I going to get zapped? Come on. There's something under here. Right. Why would
[6279.38s -> 6290.82s]  they have this? Are we for later? I hear something in the water. What's in the water? I just heard
[6290.82s -> 6314.06s]  that. What is that for? A rope? It was you. I didn't sound like me. Whoa. You guys can't see
[6314.14s -> 6338.66s]  how much ammo I have. Right. I wish I should. Does it matter? Lower left is now you can actually see
[6338.66s -> 6343.99s]  how much ammo I have. Save the game. I mean, I'm I doesn't know where I can save right now.
[6347.59s -> 6360.66s]  In the middle looks weird. Top right. I don't like top right. Flipped it. Yeah. Well, because now
[6360.66s -> 6365.78s]  if I'm looking at that way, that would be weird. I don't want to be looking this way because I need
[6365.78s -> 6385.51s]  to be looking at the game. Does it look weird? Turn it back, please. I think this is all right.
[6385.51s -> 6392.73s]  Wait, that does look kind of weird, doesn't it? Top right doesn't feel right to me, though.
[6392.73s -> 6404.70s]  It always feels weird. Right now. I hate that. I actually I actually hate that. I could go like
[6404.70s -> 6415.94s]  here. Where's the where's it come up? That's fine. I'm not I don't hate that. Right. That's OK.
[6416.58s -> 6423.08s]  There's nothing wrong with that. But that kind of then you don't get to see like kind of this side
[6423.08s -> 6439.10s]  of the screen, though, whatever. Well, you think anyone was left must be pretty tough.
[6441.59s -> 6447.86s]  Who the fuck are you? Oh, you're not local. Better.
[6452.54s -> 6462.23s]  Mother Miranda is going to love you guys. It sounds like Elvis.
[6464.89s -> 6479.06s]  Oh, Mother Miranda is going to love you when you're whining. We're almost there.
[6479.06s -> 6491.62s]  Where? Oh, what have you brought me? He's going to walk in. Oh, what have you brought me, darling?
[6491.62s -> 6517.14s]  It's to anyone else. My daughter's and I. Shut the fuck up. Where? You mean you'll screw around
[6517.14s -> 6522.18s]  with it in private. Where's the fun in that? Give it to me and I'll put on a show that everybody
[6522.18s -> 6529.54s]  can enjoy. Oh, so gauche. What do we care for bread and circuses? The man thinks suffering is a
[6530.10s -> 6533.38s]  gag. The man's dick is cut off in the castle. Blah, blah, blah.
[6535.38s -> 6541.54s]  Fuck is going on. I've heard all your arguments. Some of you were less persuasive than others,
[6541.54s -> 6550.60s]  but I've made my decision. Heisenberg, the man's fate is in your hands. Mother Miranda, I must
[6550.60s -> 6558.92s]  protest. Heisenberg is but a child and his devotion to you is questionable. Give the mortal to me and
[6558.92s -> 6565.96s]  I will ensure he is ready. Shut your damn mouth and don't be a sore loser. You'll find your food
[6565.96s -> 6571.32s]  somewhere else. Quiet now, child. What are the Avengers? They're like the evil Avengers.
[6571.32s -> 6574.76s]  You're the one who's arguing with Miranda's decision. You wouldn't know responsibility
[6574.76s -> 6578.84s]  if it was welded to them. Oh, keep growling. One day your head might actually fit your ego.
[6579.48s -> 6585.56s]  Fight, fight, fight. Hey, don't I get a say in this? Silence. My decision is final.
[6588.71s -> 6598.34s]  Remember from whence you came. Lichens and gentlemen,
[6599.38s -> 6611.02s]  we thank you for winning. And now let the games begin. Let's see what you have here, Ethan. Get
[6611.02s -> 6628.62s]  ready. Get ready. You missed. Nine, eight, seven. I didn't get any water. I just needed water.
[6629.50s -> 6631.74s]  One sip of water. All right.
[6646.60s -> 6657.05s]  This is a game. It's a game to them. It's a game. Whoa. It's a fucking game.
[6657.77s -> 6701.29s]  Why do I keep duck? Oh shit. I didn't duck. It's a game show. No, no, no, no, no. Joel already made
[6701.29s -> 6718.33s]  that joke. Fuck. I should have played this a week ago. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
[6718.33s -> 6742.65s]  What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Who says? Who said that? Open. Open. Break it.
[6743.61s -> 6766.20s]  Break it. What happened? What just happened? What?
[6773.88s -> 6781.61s]  I was trying to break the box. I couldn't break it. Break. Break. No, wrong way. Oh, I just. I
[6781.61s -> 6798.47s]  can't even. Wait. Oh, no. Never mind. I was about to do like a bit, but I cut it off. This is so loud.
[6798.47s -> 6803.67s]  I got to turn this down. Oh my God. Like I'm talking way louder than I normally would be.
[6814.22s -> 6834.06s]  Sorry. Building all this bullshit. All right. So I can't break that shit.
[6842.36s -> 6849.11s]  Okay. Wait a minute. So what's going on here? I can't break those. So I just have to run.
[6849.11s -> 6885.61s]  I don't think I can break them. Does it go this far? Whoa. Chill.
[6894.79s -> 6902.28s]  300 bucks. Handgun ammo. I've had my weapons too. Well, you tell me I couldn't like pick that up.
[6902.28s -> 6905.72s]  No, I couldn't have. Never mind. I could have shot the handgun though.
[6908.02s -> 6917.96s]  And you tell me I couldn't have shot the handgun. Is that going to move?
[6917.96s -> 6926.09s]  That's going to move. All right. Oh my God. All this is. Oh my goodness gracious. Okay.
[6927.46s -> 6945.85s]  Uh, it's going to drop. It's going to drop. God. I made it. All right. How is he communicating
[6945.85s -> 6968.38s]  with me by the way? I'm confused about that. The speaker. This is just a saw game. I mean,
[6968.38s -> 6975.35s]  it kind of is. It's good so far. I like it. Don't take the first five minutes of this game. What I
[6975.35s -> 6987.13s]  said just to turn if I like this game. Big burps. All right. So now we just got to go back in there
[6987.13s -> 6992.98s]  and just wait, go back to where we just were and just go through and like wipe the sweat off my
[6992.98s -> 7010.04s]  brown be like, all right, I did it. Got to be something over here, right? He's going to have
[7010.04s -> 7016.33s]  a stopwatch. He's going to be like, there you are. Record time. Something like that. Right.
[7016.33s -> 7026.90s]  That was like a test. See if I'm worthy to be the next Avenger. I've been waiting for you, Mr.
[7026.90s -> 7035.30s]  Winter. How do you know my name? Anyone who's anyone has heard of the likes of you. A hero
[7035.30s -> 7043.46s]  searching for his daughter. I must say that castle arouses suspicion. These are fairy tale
[7043.46s -> 7051.30s]  characters. This is like Humpty Dumpty. This is fairy tale characters, right?
[7052.10s -> 7059.62s]  Call me the Duke. Now to business. Weapons, ammunition, healing salves, anything you desire.
[7059.62s -> 7066.46s]  Holy shit. You really let yourself go since Resident Evil 4. I can't wait to buy something
[7066.46s -> 7077.93s]  happen. Be like, Oh, wow. Thank you. It's right. The same guy. I was just thinking of ways to pass
[7077.93s -> 7088.70s]  the time. Plies, guns, smithy, the Duke's purse. Everything has. Okay. What about supplies and
[7088.70s -> 7092.30s]  thousand extra baggage, increased number of item slots available in your inventory.
[7094.02s -> 7103.06s]  I only have 910 bucks. Shotgun ammo. Learn how to make shotgun ammo. That's really huge.
[7103.70s -> 7113.67s]  Sniper rifle, ammo, mines. All right. This is cool. Gun smithy. Oh no. I have to pick what I want.
[7113.67s -> 7123.59s]  I can't even afford any of this, but, Oh, I know people are going to be like, dude, you don't do
[7123.59s -> 7138.89s]  that handgun. Pick this other gun. Crystal. Ooh, I can sell that for two grand. 12,000 for the
[7138.89s -> 7144.57s]  shotgun. What if I just sell this and make the handgun awesome? That'd be kind of cool, right?
[7145.21s -> 7151.88s]  Don't dump dump. Well, I'm going to sell the crystal fragment. Why wouldn't I?
[7154.28s -> 7168.58s]  How do I sell it? No, don't. No, I knew this was going to happen. I just knew this was going to
[7168.58s -> 7173.14s]  happen. I knew I was going to, I was going to sell the crystal. What? Let me guess. You can put like
[7173.14s -> 7177.22s]  three crystals in like a crown and then the three crystal crown becomes like 50 grand.
[7177.86s -> 7189.99s]  White mineral found in this region could probably sell it valuable. I'm just selling it. I don't
[7189.99s -> 7195.80s]  care. Get mad. Everyone's going to get angry about this, but I'm just selling it. I'm buying this
[7195.80s -> 7199.48s]  because of our relationship, you know? Whatever. If I get it wrong, I get it wrong.
[7200.28s -> 7207.69s]  It literally says component. Securing goods is more important than anything. All right. Now
[7207.69s -> 7212.81s]  let's see. What do I got? Can I upgrade? Wait, I want to, how much is shotgun ammo? 3000. I need
[7212.81s -> 7228.78s]  100. I'm going to sell some stuff. Okay. I'm going to sell. How much do I need? You can sell
[7228.78s -> 7240.14s]  anything that says valuable, but don't sell things that say combinable. All right. I just need 90.
[7240.62s -> 7249.48s]  I'm going to sell six handguns. Little and often fills the purse as they say.
[7250.20s -> 7256.28s]  Okay. Now I want to buy, I want to be able to make 3000. Make shotgun ammo. That's huge. That's
[7256.28s -> 7261.96s]  really important. I want it. I see. Anything else? Okay. I'm skilled at all sorts of weapons
[7261.96s -> 7269.56s]  modifications and we'll do them until next we meet. All right. What does it take to make
[7269.56s -> 7277.96s]  shotgun ammo? Gunpowder, rusted scrap and chem fluid. Oh, that's a lot. I think in my head,
[7277.96s -> 7288.09s]  you have to restart. Hey, thank you. Hey, you already fucked it. Oh, oh, that's cool. I need
[7288.09s -> 7298.20s]  to save the game. Sell ammo to get ammo. Well, yeah, I want to be able to craft shotguns. Are
[7298.20s -> 7301.80s]  you telling me that the shotgun ammo crafting ability is more important than like six handgun
[7301.80s -> 7307.35s]  bullets? I'm probably going to need it like right now. I'm at the last boss. This is the
[7307.35s -> 7311.67s]  game's almost over. This is the demo guys. The game didn't even fucking come out. I don't know
[7311.67s -> 7333.45s]  what everyone's freaking out for. It's behind the curtain. Could Rose be here? Three daughters,
[7333.45s -> 7344.04s]  Bella, Cassandra and Daniella. Mm hmm. Okay. Mm hmm. Uh, January 5th, uh, redneck delivery of one
[7344.04s -> 7350.04s]  male, three females, a Miranda meeting with mistress Dimitrescu. How do I pronounce this?
[7350.92s -> 7366.95s]  Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, the Duke business discussions. Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu,
[7367.03s -> 7376.52s]  Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu, Dimitrescu. Yeah. Dimitrescu.
[7377.72s -> 7386.49s]  Dimitrek. I not how you say this is a big house. Okay, hold on. Well, let's go away. What about
[7386.49s -> 7394.68s]  over here? Don't step on that. You like always step on wooden fall. Ooh, what's this? 500 bucks. I
[7394.68s -> 7402.26s]  could have saved that money. Whatever. Nothing happens. I'm going to turn that on later. All
[7402.26s -> 7412.44s]  right. Let's keep going. It's like an elevator room. They say it in the game. They do. You're a
[7412.44s -> 7423.00s]  liar. I, I guarantee they don't say Dimitrescu one time in the whole game. I bet you one wink
[7423.00s -> 7436.12s]  that they don't. Now remember, I don't think they say, like I could say it and like other characters,
[7436.12s -> 7439.48s]  but I'm talking about like the Dimitrescu family is not going to say Dimitrescu the whole game.
[7442.42s -> 7454.89s]  Like I'm lady Dimitrescu. No. All right. That's good. Hang on anymore. That was weird.
[7455.45s -> 7476.98s]  They literally said it. No, but for us again, my baby, that was the baby scream. Okay. Hall,
[7476.98s -> 7496.17s]  hall of the four. What is that? Oh, and mask the angels blinded gaze and you'll eat a shitload of
[7496.17s -> 7521.96s]  bugs. Hey, what the fuck? This guy's life sucks.
[7539.00s -> 7549.46s]  Mother, I bring you fresh prey. You are so kind to me, daughters. Now let's take a look at him.
[7551.03s -> 7557.43s]  Wow. Well, Ethan Winters, you escaped my little brother's idiot games. Did you?
[7558.79s -> 7563.11s]  Let's see how special. I don't want to play any more games. Yes, mother.
[7567.26s -> 7570.14s]  Can you just get out? Can we talk? Like why do I have to play games?
[7573.50s -> 7586.22s]  Starting to go a little stale. Then let's devour his man flesh quickly, mother. I am the one who
[7586.22s -> 7590.86s]  captured him. No, no, daughters. First. I must inform mother Miranda,
[7591.74s -> 7596.70s]  but later. Well, there will be enough for everyone.
[7599.34s -> 7605.38s]  Do vampires have like a blood filter? Like we filter water. Like wouldn't that just be the
[7605.38s -> 7620.04s]  equivalent of like drinking out of the sewer? I don't know. I feel like it's dirty. You need
[7620.52s -> 7636.25s]  like a vampire Britta. What the fuck was that? What was that? What was that thing? What was she
[7636.25s -> 7655.27s]  smelling? What was she just sitting at? What the fuck was that? All right. So if I sit here for 15
[7655.27s -> 7666.10s]  minutes, I don't do anything. The main character bad guy from fall out, fall guys. What's the game?
[7666.10s -> 7673.16s]  I've ruined the joke already. Well, what's the name of the fucking game? Far cry. I gotta get
[7673.16s -> 7677.32s]  out of here before they come back. Whatever. I was gonna say he kicks the door and he's like,
[7677.32s -> 7695.74s]  Hey, remember me? And then he lets me out. Whatever. It would have been funny. I couldn't
[7695.74s -> 7704.62s]  even think of the name. They're all like far cry. Far out. Fall out. Fall guys. Fall cry. Cry far.
[7704.62s -> 7727.61s]  Like how many? Whatever. His poor guy's hands kind of wish like, Oh, his fingers would be like,
[7731.06s -> 7737.13s]  like, Oh, cool. That'd be totally video game of this. Wouldn't it? By the way, why did I
[7737.13s -> 7744.02s]  wink? She didn't say it. She didn't say Dimitra Sue. That one was free. It was in glass.
[7744.74s -> 7759.46s]  It was a free wing. All right, there's a big lever here. I take that. Okay. Hold on. I have
[7759.46s -> 7764.02s]  yet to understand what the fucking goal is because every time I walk in a room, one of the main
[7764.02s -> 7767.46s]  characters is like, Oh, let's play with him. And then there's no goal. They just like do something
[7767.46s -> 7786.06s]  weird and leave. Look for Rose in the castle. Okay. Easy to pick lock. I need a lock pick.
[7786.62s -> 7806.04s]  Get in there. Oh, secret hidden tunnel. Not yet. Hold on. That's probably stuff. Yeah. This like
[7806.04s -> 7812.76s]  something in here. Books, things to read. Can I leave? Can I just open the door? Of course not.
[7812.76s -> 7815.64s]  All right. Well, I, there's a locked lock pick thing right there. I was going to come back with
[7815.64s -> 7826.86s]  a lock pick and let's go. By the way, I think since using the 3090, I think this room has
[7826.86s -> 7835.14s]  increased its temperature by five full degrees. I need like an air conditioning unit or my computer.
[7836.50s -> 7839.46s]  I swear to God, I think it's probably 80 plus degrees in here right now.
[7839.46s -> 7860.02s]  Scrap. Okay. I can make, um, some stuff. Pick up the baby. Rune eye ring. Throw your case. No,
[7860.58s -> 7866.01s]  I don't, I'm not, I don't want to do that. You guys are like, make fun of my cable management
[7866.01s -> 7872.52s]  or something. It'll always be something. Throw your case. Oh, wow. Nice cable management. Like
[7872.52s -> 7887.93s]  whatever. I don't care. Okay. We know the bed chamber is a hall of the four, which is,
[7887.93s -> 7893.51s]  oh, wait, I can open this door now. Wait, is that the coin in here going to break this
[7894.71s -> 7908.78s]  crystal fragment? Hell yeah. All right. And where's the next, um, wait,
[7909.50s -> 7915.45s]  turn on ray tracing for just a little bit. I don't know. It'll get, it'll be a hundred degrees in
[7915.45s -> 7930.52s]  here. Ray tracing is a meme guys. It doesn't matter. All right. So that's like a little
[7930.52s -> 7940.54s]  shortcut to the bed chamber. I mean, like it's cool, but it's really cool. Well, I don't know.
[7940.54s -> 7947.00s]  I don't really care to like increase my like graphics card energy consumption by like 150%
[7947.64s -> 7953.90s]  to like have the floors be reflective. I don't, I don't care. I would, I would, I have my like
[7953.90s -> 7959.74s]  comfort in this room of it being 80 degrees, way more, put it, I put it so much higher than
[7959.74s -> 7968.25s]  like a reflective screen, like a reflective mirror. This shit will be roasting in here.
[7968.25s -> 7980.60s]  It's cool. I don't hate it, but I need like a fucking car exhaust on here. Ask the angels,
[7980.60s -> 7995.21s]  blind the gaze, the ring. Okay. Mask the angels, blind the gaze. Oh, this is okay. I'll figure
[7995.21s -> 8005.30s]  that out later. This is like the ultimate puzzle. Probably. Let's go up. It seems to be the place
[8005.30s -> 8027.67s]  to go. It's a cool house. Nice. I got to save money. How many suits of armor? This is, that's
[8027.67s -> 8032.82s]  weird. I have a suit of armor. This many suits of armor in your house. It's too many. I can understand
[8032.82s -> 8049.24s]  one more than one is very strange than a T that lipstick of blood or both. Why would you drink
[8049.24s -> 8055.82s]  blood? Okay. Is it weird that I find it less disgusting if they were to literally cook me
[8055.82s -> 8060.78s]  and eat me than if they were to drink my blood while I'm alive? I find that to be like just less
[8060.78s -> 8074.49s]  gross. Can I unlock this? I can. Excellent. All right. So now there's a way to get around this
[8074.49s -> 8094.17s]  whole house. Let's go up here. I'm going up. I hear something moving. Wine room. Ooh,
[8095.13s -> 8106.90s]  this is going to be blood. All right. I can make shotgun. Whoa. I can be 30. Whoa. No, I can't. I
[8106.90s -> 8118.31s]  need two rusted scrap. Shit. Wait. How many rusted scrap do I have? Just one. Why am I making tech?
[8118.31s -> 8126.73s]  Whatever. I don't care. Put the ring on it. You can't use that. What? Like a gravy boat?
[8128.07s -> 8130.79s]  All right. I got to like put gravy in the gravy boat or whatever I need to do.
[8135.21s -> 8144.68s]  I got to remember this. The French champagne. It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[8145.69s -> 8156.33s]  There is a California champagne by Paul Marceau. I love that guy. Ring. Maroon eye ring. You can't
[8156.33s -> 8169.53s]  use this as is. Why not take the eye out? Can I like examine it? Okay. Maroon eye. All right.
[8169.53s -> 8180.81s]  I know where that goes. Say Aaron. Okay. I'll do a Kickstarter campaign for 1.4 million dollars.
[8182.47s -> 8196.82s]  And if it gets to 1.4 million, I will say Aaron on stream. How's that sound? I need to save the
[8196.82s -> 8216.10s]  game very, very badly. I've not saved the game since. What the fuck? This guy's hands. What? Oh
[8216.10s -> 8224.09s]  God. Slice your jugular. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's not do that. I'm not taking a lie.
[8224.09s -> 8229.21s]  Dad, which would you prefer? Nothing. Neither. No. Can I hide in the closet? I can't hold back
[8229.21s -> 8252.31s]  any longer. What do I do? Oh my God. I thought that just said German 985. It's a German 985.
[8253.50s -> 8257.66s]  It was my first day working at the castle today. I was most shocked to see the other staff were
[8257.66s -> 8261.74s]  all women. The mistress and her daughters were very adamant that they wouldn't bite.
[8261.74s -> 8267.24s]  It was quite peculiar. It's been two weeks since I started working at the castle and I'm a little
[8267.24s -> 8272.52s]  afraid. Another maid, Adela, made a mistake and Miss Daniella slashed her face with a knife.
[8273.24s -> 8277.24s]  And at night I can hear wailing as if ghosts roam the halls. I want to go home.
[8277.24s -> 8282.41s]  I don't know what to do. The young ladies were complaining it was too hot and stuffy during
[8282.41s -> 8287.37s]  dinner. So I opened the window, just a crack. Shut it. Shut it now. They all freaked at me in
[8287.37s -> 8292.82s]  unison. Looks like I'm gonna have to suffer with my 3090 in my own bedroom in heat.
[8294.52s -> 8297.88s]  That was funny. I refused to see fucking minus twos. That was actually really funny.
[8298.44s -> 8302.81s]  I fear I may be taken down into the cellar and never to be seen again. I don't know what to do.
[8302.81s -> 8306.97s]  I don't know what to do. That was funny. Don't fucking tell me it wasn't. I know when it was
[8306.97s -> 8342.57s]  funny because I know. Okay, now it's funny. Now it's funny. This game is really cool. I'm really
[8342.57s -> 8363.14s]  into it. Oh my god, is that Lady Dimitrescu? Hey Cabbagehead, PhD, thanks for the 25 community subs.
[8363.14s -> 8371.42s]  That's a lot of money, thank you. Tasting room, thanks for the 25 subs. I just went too far when
[8371.42s -> 8377.72s]  I looked over at chat. That hurt. Do they chase you around the house? Oh my god, they probably do.
[8377.72s -> 8394.87s]  Should I go in that door she just opened? Yeah. Oh my god, is she gonna come back in here? Wait,
[8394.87s -> 8400.90s]  something. Hurry, hurry, hurry before she comes back. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I need a typewriter
[8400.90s -> 8430.26s]  room. So bad, it's not even funny. Snake in here? They still do that in these games? No. Dump that?
[8430.26s -> 8455.42s]  Trust in light. All right, light it up. What does that do? Boom, boom, boom, boom. He walks down the
[8455.42s -> 8478.23s]  hall with a sledgehammer. Where the hell am I? Fuck, it's covered in dried blood. I don't understand.
[8478.23s -> 8495.62s]  Was this like a, was it putting somebody inside of that? Oh, all right, I have to be honest with you.
[8495.62s -> 8502.55s]  I feel like this would kind of feel kind of good. I have like chest and like back pain issues and
[8502.55s -> 8506.63s]  I feel like sitting there and pushing back on those just lightly would hit like a bunch
[8506.63s -> 8539.53s]  of pressure points if I didn't do it too hard. You're a freak. All right, I wouldn't want to
[8539.53s -> 8545.45s]  put that on somebody. Wouldn't that be fucking terrifying? Like, oh yeah, go get the pig mask
[8545.45s -> 8552.04s]  thing. No, no, I don't want to do that. That's scary, man. Like that's fucking terrifying to me.
[8552.04s -> 8559.83s]  Can't we just like beat the shit out of him? Why do we have to like put like a fucking weird
[8559.83s -> 8571.93s]  mask on him? I don't, I don't want to do that. Help me. It's a horror game. I know, but like I'm
[8571.93s -> 8577.50s]  just saying like that's, they used to do all kinds of fucked up shit back in like the medieval times
[8577.50s -> 8588.47s]  and stuff. It's like, why would you want to do that? Like look at all this stuff. I don't want
[8588.47s -> 8593.59s]  to like pull somebody's fucking teeth out while they sit on like a bunch of spikes and nails.
[8594.31s -> 8619.91s]  I missed a save point. I did. Where? I just closed myself in a cell next to the angel.
[8622.09s -> 8659.18s]  Where? Hold on a second. This is a cool photo. Focus area right up, right up in the front.
[8659.18s -> 8677.82s]  Actually cool. It's a cool photo. Hold on. I wish I could actually use, scroll with this.
[8677.82s -> 8681.66s]  Wow, this is such a weird way to do this. Focus area. I want it like back.
[8685.53s -> 8704.62s]  Why can't I go back with the focus area? There you go. Okay. It's a console port. Blur strength.
[8704.62s -> 8710.90s]  Yeah, I want it to be like blurry up here. Focus area. Where is this focus area?
[8711.46s -> 8717.00s]  I don't even know what the fuck they're trying to tell me. Please play the game. I'm, this is,
[8717.00s -> 8724.25s]  I'm taking a, I took a picture in photo mode. I want to do this. I can't take five fucking,
[8724.25s -> 8727.45s]  less than five seconds to do this. I mean, it's been like probably two minutes, but still.
[8728.25s -> 8744.70s]  I think, I think it's a cool photo. Wait, I didn't know I could do these.
[8744.70s -> 8756.95s]  I could have had a newspaper for the, I could have had it on this animal display.
[8756.95s -> 8775.78s]  All right. That's cool. All right. I went in here. I don't want to miss.
[8776.66s -> 8785.74s]  I must have fireworks. Why would you do this to somebody?
[8798.65s -> 8805.05s]  Arena. Robust appetite. Mahala. Robust appetite. Lois.
[8808.04s -> 8824.82s]  Ingrid. Unstable. Overly alert at times. Somebody just said, bye. Bye. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[8835.53s -> 8842.86s]  You're giving me a lot of shotgun bullets here. All right. What the fuck is that?
[8843.58s -> 8855.00s]  You want how to make this way scarier? I have just singing in the background,
[8855.00s -> 8860.90s]  the person, whoever this is just going like the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spot.
[8862.09s -> 8874.89s]  Down came the rain and watched the spider like twinkle, twinkle little star.
[8875.77s -> 8924.12s]  I need a typewriter. Why are you alive? Oh, money. Let me hit their head.
[8924.12s -> 8944.07s]  Hey, are you fucking invincible or what is going on here? How many times have I
[8944.07s -> 8954.87s]  shoot you in the head? All right. Get the money. Where the? Get the money. Get the money. Get the
[8954.87s -> 8969.26s]  money. Pipe bomb. Well, that would have been nice to use that. Wouldn't it have? Why is it doing the
[8969.26s -> 9011.38s]  fucking like cockroach sound? Where am I going? Stop doing the music. Stop the music. Pipe bomb.
[9011.38s -> 9040.50s]  Pipe bomb. Hey, browsing zebra. Thanks for the 20 immunity subs. Appreciate it.
[9041.06s -> 9059.48s]  Oh, I got a necklace. God damn it. I mean, this stuff, I want, I want to make sure I have tons
[9059.48s -> 9069.72s]  of ammo and tons of weapons and shit. Oh, like mother wasn't feeling well. This is just every
[9069.72s -> 9078.41s]  new, like 2020 plus 2019 horror movie trailer. This goes done, done, done. They're like dinner,
[9079.74s -> 9089.78s]  like eating, done. She changed. She was changing done. And that shows like the company's name,
[9089.78s -> 9109.83s]  the logo, still skull. Otto's not in here, right? I feel like I'm going to scare the shit out of
[9109.83s -> 9125.42s]  him. He is produced by the makers of get out. Yeah. Hannah just gave 30. What's one of the
[9125.42s -> 9133.02s]  community subs? 30 community subs from Hannah. Thank you. That's a shit load of subs. There's
[9133.02s -> 9145.78s]  like about like 150 subs have come in. I guess give me so much money. That was scary. Another
[9145.78s -> 9150.98s]  one of these doors that I cannot go into. Eventually I'll get whatever that is. Whatever
[9151.06s -> 9155.70s]  that would have a medallion that is. Thanks. That's a lot. Thank you, Hannah.
[9164.65s -> 9176.57s]  God, I need a typewriter. We typewriter. I'm not healthy. I'm very unhealthy right now.
[9176.57s -> 9180.41s]  Actually, you know, not even a bar of chocolate and cheeseburgers. I ate the last few years.
[9181.29s -> 9187.34s]  I need that. Whatever it is. Which tools do you prefer? I prefer
[9193.18s -> 9194.46s]  the
[9195.58s -> 9199.58s]  I'm okay. I'm okay. Drink the poison, whatever it is. Poison, poison, eat the poison.
[9206.46s -> 9223.62s]  No, I'm just picking up random items. Open it. Don't use those.
[9229.37s -> 9242.12s]  It's light. Light. Holy shit. Light makes you able to be injured.
[9242.12s -> 9259.27s]  I won't give you. Light allows me to fire at them. Die. Did I run?
[9260.79s -> 9293.58s]  Oh, did I win? Nice. That was fucking cool. This game is awesome. Besides the FOV.
[9293.58s -> 9297.18s]  And I said something very strongly about Capcom earlier and I'm going to backtrack on it. But
[9297.18s -> 9305.51s]  like fuck that. What the fuck are they doing? You're getting a lot of good like YouTuber
[9305.59s -> 9318.79s]  screams, by the way, this stream. Tons of like thumbnail images. I need a typewriter so bad.
[9323.37s -> 9335.46s]  Sangui. I don't know about that. I have no idea. Another one was sent to the cellar.
[9335.46s -> 9344.01s]  She only had spilled some soup. They're evil. All right. I need to how much chem fluid do I have?
[9346.28s -> 9358.65s]  Just three shotgun shells. I'm going to make it. I need some more chem fluid. That was intense.
[9359.29s -> 9369.82s]  Look at the name. It's virgin. It's a virgin strawberry. What about a little banana? What
[9369.82s -> 9394.26s]  about a little banana? Magic bullet. It can do anything. Save you idiot. I don't know what
[9394.26s -> 9401.32s]  saving even means. Recoil compensator. There's no typewriter. I haven't seen a typewriter in like
[9401.32s -> 9409.50s]  an hour and 20 minutes. I have not seen a single typewriter in 20 minutes. 30 minutes at least.
[9414.01s -> 9423.00s]  You missed it. Where is it? Sorry. I was being chased by like a murderous lady. There's a room
[9423.00s -> 9440.94s]  you missed. Should I hold on to this? This is for the lemmy. Okay. Nice. Recoil dampening.
[9441.58s -> 9454.81s]  Just keep moving. You'll get. All right. All right. I'm going to keep moving. Yes.
[9455.61s -> 9467.26s]  Do I only get one of these? Do I get one? How many do I get? Oh, one. Why did I use it on the
[9467.26s -> 9474.22s]  most obvious of things? Wooden angel statue. I feel like I picked up a bunch of random shit and
[9474.22s -> 9483.38s]  I have absolutely no idea where it goes. I have this. A vintage bottle of wine. Looks like it was
[9483.38s -> 9492.95s]  bottled a long time ago. Crystal fragment. Crystal skull. Crystal torso. Crimson glass.
[9493.67s -> 9509.32s]  Wooden angel. I just have a ton of this stuff. Crystal head vodka. Oh my god. I need a typewriter.
[9509.32s -> 9516.66s]  I know it's part of the game. I know that like, look, remember Resident Evil when we had to go
[9516.66s -> 9521.06s]  find a typewriter and use ink ribbons and shit. I know it's like, oh, look, it's like nostalgic.
[9521.06s -> 9534.81s]  Just give me a fucking exit. Like save game right here. Auto saves. Bad take. It's not.
[9535.45s -> 9552.98s]  That's not a bad take. Key items. Wait. I need a special key. Okay. Half of the four.
[9554.01s -> 9574.58s]  Put the bottle in the gravy. I like it. The typewriter. Just wait. Let's shot that. All right.
[9575.93s -> 9579.77s]  They point by the faceless statue. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9580.89s -> 9598.10s]  Half of the four. Typewriter. Oh, we meet again. Hello. Duke, why are you here?
[9599.06s -> 9609.59s]  Where there's coin to be made. And have you found your daughter? Fake Fiji. If she is truly here,
[9609.59s -> 9615.03s]  the lady of the castle would have kept little Rose in her private chambers, would she not?
[9615.59s -> 9622.07s]  Demetresque? The very same. Why don't you take a look? Maybe you'll get lucky.
[9622.87s -> 9630.31s]  And speaking of looking, care to make a purchase? It's Demetresque. It's not Demetresu.
[9634.17s -> 9643.24s]  It's Demetresu. Demetresu. Demetresque? That's, I am very, very surprised.
[9645.14s -> 9659.58s]  Zim and put the wine here. Can't use that here. Craftsman, whatever. Naturally. Okay. Crystal
[9659.58s -> 9668.17s]  torso. Treasure. Valuable. Treasure. Valuable. Valuable. So should I do these? Something can
[9668.17s -> 9681.06s]  go inside of the chest there, right? Can things go? Wait a minute. Let me just check. Care. It
[9681.06s -> 9687.74s]  would say. Okay. You wish to make a purchase. Sell it all. It would actually say like,
[9687.74s -> 9698.42s]  combinable. Let's just get rid of sell it all. 1,905,000. Crimson glass. Wooden angel statue.
[9699.99s -> 9705.61s]  Necklace. Wait, wait. I should examine this stuff first? Because yeah, some of this. You can like
[9705.61s -> 9712.97s]  touch this stuff and like look around at it. Examine. All right. This, maybe the second
[9712.97s -> 9730.47s]  thing I can touch or open or click on. I get it. Hold on. No, nothing. I guess I don't think so.
[9730.47s -> 9735.67s]  It's an escape room. Wait, I know, but like I'm serious. There's probably like a button on this
[9735.67s -> 9744.23s]  shit somewhere. I'm serious. This is just Skyrim. It's not. All right. You owe us a wink. There you
[9744.23s -> 9752.60s]  go. What about the glass? All right. Please spam yes if I'm overthinking the absolute hell out of
[9752.60s -> 9769.54s]  this. Am I just overthinking this like crazy for no reason? Sell it all. I have 19,000 bucks.
[9771.30s -> 9783.38s]  Supplies. I can get increased item slots. Mines. I could just buy some first aid. Rock on ammo.
[9784.10s -> 9799.06s]  High capacity magazine. Hair trigger. Greatly increases fire rate. Well, more probably slots.
[9799.62s -> 9803.99s]  I'm going to do the safe thing. Ah, so you noticed that. Give me the safe thing.
[9805.94s -> 9814.47s]  I'm going to buy, I'm buying, I'm buying one of those and I'm going to buy, I'm going to buy some
[9814.47s -> 9821.06s]  shotgun ammo. How much should I buy? It's one, it's a thousand for one shot. No, thank you.
[9821.86s -> 9831.43s]  Can I get the boom, boom, boom for the shotgun? Greatly increases fire rate. I think I'm going to
[9831.43s -> 9842.98s]  do it. Yeah, I want it. Nice. All right. I'm out of money. I'm skilled at all sorts of weapons.
[9842.98s -> 9848.55s]  Thank you for your patronage. Well, this has just, he just yelled that at me. That was weird. Okay.
[9849.59s -> 9868.33s]  Way more space. All right. Let me rearrange. How do I rearrange? Shift, move. Okay. Let me clean up
[9868.33s -> 9885.51s]  my inventory. It looks, it's a mess. That's better. No. Yeah. See, that's much better.
[9886.07s -> 9899.19s]  Rock on ammo. Let's get it. It's a Tarkov inventory. Holy shit. Look at how far away this was.
[9900.94s -> 9913.06s]  This was an hour and 45 minutes ago. I would have been so sad if I didn't get it. Okay.
[9915.16s -> 9918.60s]  So what, what are you actually supposed to go here? Let me pick up some keywords.
[9919.78s -> 9925.91s]  Labyrinth, house on a hill, water wheel, iron tower, labyrinth, unique, special crafted metal
[9925.91s -> 9943.61s]  ball, special metal ball. Okay. I need a special metal ball. Where have I not gone?
[9944.79s -> 9954.68s]  Uh, I could, there's something, I could go this way. We'll go into Lady, uh, Lady Demetrius's
[9954.68s -> 9966.33s]  chambers. What's this? Is that guy all right? What just happened? Wait, what? What did he do?
[9967.13s -> 9977.48s]  By the way, that guy's definitely sitting on the toilet. I would be shocked if he wasn't.
[9977.48s -> 9983.93s]  Okay. We need to go to Lady Demetrius's chamber. Let's just go this way. Right.
[9984.17s -> 10006.01s]  Uh, bed chamber. Q is spin. I got to remember that. Nothing here. This is not Lady Demetrius's
[10006.01s -> 10030.86s]  chamber. Isn't this her bedroom? This is not her bedroom. I think it's upstairs. I'm just saying
[10030.86s -> 10038.18s]  it to piss us off now. I don't, I don't, I'm sorry. I have my own head cannon. Demit, Demetrius. It
[10038.18s -> 10043.22s]  sounds much more, I don't know. What was it? I don't even know. I don't remember even what it was
[10043.22s -> 10057.10s]  because I find it to be something I don't want to say. Domitresque. That sounds, okay. So like,
[10057.10s -> 10060.38s]  have you heard it like, oh, what would you, what would you like on your, on your taco?
[10060.38s -> 10067.32s]  I'll take a, uh, jalapeño, please. It's jalapeno. Like, I feel like domitresque is
[10067.32s -> 10083.51s]  Demitrisu. That's not how language works. I don't know. What do you want me to say?
[10083.51s -> 10101.75s]  All right. I need to go DEE. You're the one saying jalapeno though. Whatever. Is the wine room? No.
[10101.75s -> 10113.05s]  Okay. Now where are we going? Where is Demitrius's chambers? Here? Walk from the other side. Sure.
[10113.69s -> 10158.17s]  Where's this lady sleep? Oh, I have the bottle of wine. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, courtyard key. I got a new
[10158.17s -> 10169.74s]  key. Is it right? Nice. Let me look at what it says. Key for the door from the castle's dining
[10169.74s -> 10181.30s]  hall to the courtyard. Down to the dining hall. Get the bottles. I don't waste bullets. No.
[10181.30s -> 10203.06s]  Don't break all this shit. God damn it. Where do I go? Where's the dining room?
[10203.62s -> 10209.18s]  Dining room is behind me. So it's behind her. So I'm going to run. I'm just going to do a juke
[10209.18s -> 10220.66s]  and run right by her. Here we go. Oh, she's fast. She's fast. She's fast. Oh, she's fast.
[10220.66s -> 10247.32s]  Oh, she's fast. Oh, all right. That was not hard. Think fast. Think fast. I can do it. Think fast.
[10247.32s -> 10259.67s]  Sora, think fast. Think fast. I can do it. Think fast. Nope. Think fast. So it's close. Think fast.
[10260.15s -> 10281.82s]  Think fast. There it is. I need to do another. I don't know what that is. There's no doors.
[10286.97s -> 10305.45s]  Open. Okay. I'm getting the shotgun out for this one. I thought I had 38 rounds. I was like, wow,
[10305.45s -> 10321.29s]  I just beat the game wicked easily. Hey, Titans and Eren's voice. No, that gets me in trouble.
[10321.29s -> 10336.42s]  I'm not doing it. I got to like open the window so light comes in so I can shoot the people.
[10337.14s -> 10361.11s]  What have you done to my daughter? You know, I'm here. Oh, a map. Oh, dude. Dude. Dude. Yes.
[10367.56s -> 10383.83s]  We're going to, I'm going to kill Lady Dimitrescu. Dude. Hello. It's me, daughter killer. I'd like to
[10383.83s -> 10413.98s]  talk to you. I'd like to have a little bit of conversation. What are these? Why are they holes?
[10414.06s -> 10443.42s]  It's a gamer chair. That's so stupid. What do I have to do there? What have you done to my daughter?
[10445.21s -> 10456.58s]  My daughter. What do you do? My daughter. There's something I'm doing here.
[10461.37s -> 10465.05s]  Women are blind to male advances, but the poor shall take their chances
[10465.05s -> 10480.23s]  to give their lord their bounties sown so that soon the wine may flow. Like move them?
[10480.31s -> 10491.83s]  Women are blind to male advances, but male advances turn to, or what was it? Women are blind
[10491.83s -> 10499.16s]  to male advances, but the poor shall take their chances to give their lord the bounties sworn
[10499.16s -> 10516.14s]  so that soon the wine may flow. Okay. So they have to, this is the lord. Who's this? Women?
[10517.42s -> 10528.02s]  Women are, women are blind to male advances. So you look this way. Yeah, I got it.
[10529.35s -> 10533.03s]  That's the lord and that's the wine. I know. What do you think? I don't know what I'm doing.
[10535.21s -> 10552.76s]  Oh my goodness. What a gamer. Thanks. This is, I fell asleep. Well, then you must not even have
[10552.76s -> 10557.24s]  the volume on because there's, okay, if you're sleeping on this stream, the stream is muted.
[10557.24s -> 10561.40s]  There's been screams and shit. Shotgun blasts in your ears. Like there's no way you're watching
[10561.40s -> 10571.08s]  the stream muted. You know, the times I've screamed in the last hour, like as loud as my body can
[10571.08s -> 10588.15s]  probably do it. What the hell? Damn it. Okay. This is going to be scary. I know it. This is
[10588.15s -> 10600.18s]  going to be scary. There's going to be scary monster. Yes, there is. Can I, can I jump over
[10600.18s -> 10622.84s]  this? Nope. I just have to kill this guy. Where'd he go? He's in the water. Oh my God. Is that him?
[10622.84s -> 10647.82s]  No. Women are blind to male advances, but male advances take their chances for the lord they
[10647.82s -> 10657.64s]  seek to swore their keep. The wine will flow. Balls deep. I don't know. Whatever it was.
[10658.20s -> 10678.87s]  I think there's another one right here. That low recoil is awesome. That's really useful.
[10679.43s -> 10696.50s]  Oh, I got to reply. This is important. Remember that sounded like iPhone predict text. Sometimes
[10696.50s -> 10702.26s]  I feel like I actually am doing iPhone predict text. Sometimes my brain goes too fast and has
[10702.26s -> 10706.82s]  to just say words that just sound like they might fit there. It actually happens all the time.
[10707.54s -> 10726.46s]  Yeah. You're too close. You're too close. You were just way too close. I'm sorry. Way too close.
[10727.10s -> 10735.05s]  Well, what the hell was that for? That didn't do anything for me. There's a screwed everything
[10735.05s -> 10743.69s]  up. Now open this. I'm going to have to close this on somebody. Somebody's going to be coming
[10743.69s -> 10758.66s]  down this way and I'm going to close it on him. Like right now, like right now close it. Where'd
[10758.66s -> 10806.58s]  they go? Three shots. Okay. Worked out. Hypers drink the bong water, bong water. I can't see
[10806.58s -> 10822.95s]  anything. I'm going to make some handgun ammo. This game is actually pretty scary. It's really
[10822.95s -> 10868.60s]  scary. Run, run. All right. I got to make handgun ammo. Aaron, are you? Oh, that was not a smart
[10868.60s -> 10879.10s]  play. Very, very unintelligent play there. I'm making a lot of money. This is good. Okay. Hold
[10879.10s -> 10888.02s]  on. I need ammo. I have three med kits. I'm doing fine. Okay. Should I just make a shitload of
[10888.02s -> 10896.18s]  shotgun bullets or what? What do you think? Just make six shotgun shells and just have just a
[10896.18s -> 10902.97s]  massive amount of bullets. What should I make? Be safe. No, whatever. I'm going to make these.
[10903.77s -> 10925.64s]  Still something in here that I'm missing. I got a P too. I'm going to go. I got to do my first P
[10925.64s -> 10949.59s]  and then I'm going to refill my fake Fiji water. Why are you here? I get a lot of items.
[10953.29s -> 10966.47s]  I hear something. Oh wait, what is this? All right. I got everything. Look at this face. I just
[10966.79s -> 11000.65s]  came all over my mouth. As you're over there. All right. Demetrius's. I know whatever. I don't care.
[11000.65s -> 11007.99s]  Thousand bucks. Holy shit. I don't want to go in here yet. I want to go back outside here because
[11007.99s -> 11016.50s]  it's stuff. There's phones in residency. I didn't even think there'd be like a telephone in this
[11016.50s -> 11045.66s]  game. It's 2020. Hello. Hello. Hello. I'm sorry. I regret to inform you that Ethan Winters has
[11046.14s -> 11053.56s]  escaped that fool Heisenberg because he is in my castle and has already proven too
[11053.56s -> 11063.69s]  much for my daughters to handle when I find him. No, Miranda. Yes, of course. I understand the
[11063.69s -> 11073.35s]  importance of the ceremony. I won't let you down. Why does she have a reflection? Holy shit. To
[11073.35s -> 11086.79s]  hell with the ceremony. That man will pay for what he's done. What is going on in this game?
[11086.79s -> 11092.36s]  I have no idea what the story is. I'm the guy from the last game. In the last game, there was
[11092.36s -> 11095.80s]  that old, like spoilers if you haven't played Resident Evil 7, but what the hell are you watching
[11095.80s -> 11101.24s]  Resident Evil 8 for in the first place? There was the old lady in the chair was like the antagonist
[11102.47s -> 11112.36s]  and it was like this experiment, right? It was a boat. You had like this, your girlfriend was like
[11112.36s -> 11118.46s]  the runner of a project that like had to do with this little girl and the little girl like aged
[11118.46s -> 11127.18s]  rapidly into an old lady and like she was controlling everybody. Everyone was like under
[11127.18s -> 11138.42s]  her control. She was making them do like crazy things. She was the little girl's caretaker.
[11138.42s -> 11144.98s]  Yeah, right, right. But then we like escaped the island. Chris Redfield's like, nice job, nice job
[11144.98s -> 11154.78s]  partner. And now Chris Redfield wants to take my baby and like killed Mia and now we're in this
[11154.78s -> 11160.84s]  weird like fucking cartoon Avengers house. I guess we're going to figure it out with like this vampire
[11160.84s -> 11171.77s]  lady, this like little like corpse bride person, Igor, and fucking like cool like Mortal Kombat
[11171.77s -> 11190.12s]  Elvis. We're just going to find out. We were all called by Mother Miranda to decide the fate of
[11190.12s -> 11195.72s]  the child's father, me. Just thinking of that family meeting makes me shudder. I think I'm
[11195.72s -> 11201.16s]  treated like a sister to those miscreants, especially Heisenberg. That riff raff wouldn't
[11201.16s -> 11204.76s]  know proper manners if they slapped him in the face. I would have sliced him into ribbons if
[11204.76s -> 11209.77s]  Mother hadn't. OK, so Mother, why does she treat me the same as them? She gave me the
[11209.77s -> 11213.93s]  castle, obedient daughters, everlasting life. Did she not? Am I not her favorite? Am I not special?
[11214.73s -> 11241.22s]  I didn't even realize just how tall this how tall she is. That's fucking huge. Wow. Where are you?
[11241.22s -> 11246.50s]  Just realized. I mean, I mean, every time I've seen her, I've been like crouching looking up or like
[11246.50s -> 11250.82s]  in chains looking up at her. I've never like actually stood up face to face. She like picked
[11250.82s -> 11265.74s]  me up and put me on like hooks. What am I supposed to do here? Look for Rose in the castle.
[11269.29s -> 11278.50s]  I moved this? How is all this shit locked? Does it open the door from the other side?
[11279.22s -> 11310.17s]  Yeah, where am I supposed to go? I'm stuck in her bedroom. OK, the Mitrasue key. It's the one.
[11310.17s -> 11313.77s]  That's what these keys. OK, these doors. There's a couple of them I need to go to.
[11329.93s -> 11338.65s]  Lay your filthy manhands on my daughters. And now you even try to steal my property.
[11353.85s -> 11356.89s]  Go ahead, do your worst.
[11360.02s -> 11363.46s]  She's like falling, screaming like she fell in the same hole or something.
[11364.34s -> 11371.30s]  She lands right on her neck and fucking you hear just crunches her legs. Her knees hit the fucking
[11371.30s -> 11379.91s]  ground behind her and her neck just snaps off. If I fall through this, she falls through there too.
[11380.47s -> 11388.12s]  She's has she's got like at least fucking 300 pounds on me. How was the floor holding her?
[11388.12s -> 11408.89s]  If I fall through the floor, she put in so much force. I don't buy it. That's rude. She's like
[11408.89s -> 11417.51s]  12 feet tall. I'm just saying she's big. She's very large. She's like 12 and a half feet tall.
[11418.55s -> 11425.72s]  Nine feet tall. Sorry. It's OK. I got it wrong. She's like 10 feet tall. If you were 10 feet tall,
[11425.72s -> 11436.57s]  you would probably weigh like 300 fucking pounds. All right, let's go.
[11436.57s -> 11443.48s]  No, I wouldn't. Yes, you would. You'd that you'd just be a large person.
[11444.28s -> 11451.83s]  I'm going to look. All right. How much does Shaq weigh? How tall is Shaq?
[11452.39s -> 11466.81s]  Shaq's like seven five, right? Like eight feet tall. How much does Shaq weigh? Shaq is seven two.
[11468.34s -> 11478.09s]  So so Lady Demetrius is like three feet taller than Shaq. I'm going to guess that she's
[11478.09s -> 11495.27s]  probably 300 pounds. She's going to chase me around, right? This is a this is a boss room.
[11495.27s -> 11503.70s]  This is like a weird boss room. Shaq is three hundred and twenty four pounds. OK.
[11504.42s -> 11507.61s]  All right. Oh, God, what is going on? This is a boss room. I got to pay attention.
[11515.30s -> 11526.86s]  I could let you get away with a slice of your ribbons before you ever see me chuckle.
[11526.86s -> 11528.70s]  Boss fight. No.
[11532.25s -> 11549.51s]  Hey, where'd she go? Whoa. Whoa. My hand. Pull it. Cut the other hand off.
[11550.31s -> 11563.88s]  Whoa. She's probably right here. Whoa. Oh, a box. I can't. I can't do my hand.
[11567.67s -> 11594.04s]  Duck. Move out of the way. You actually thought I was going to let you get away, darling.
[11595.66s -> 11599.66s]  OK. Yep. This time, don't freak out. Just press it again.
[11601.56s -> 11621.38s]  Ow. Here it is.
[11621.38s -> 11635.16s]  I mean, no. What the fuck am I doing?
[11651.05s -> 11665.10s]  Any items, any stuff, stuff, any items? Nope. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Open the door. Key.
[11666.74s -> 11678.12s]  Open it. Oh, geez. OK, I got the mask of sorrow. Oh, geez.
[11679.08s -> 11691.85s]  I guess I'll try. What?
[11698.26s -> 11707.62s]  Is this guy like a Roblox character? Like, what is he made of the Legos? Did it work?
[11712.86s -> 11725.45s]  Screw this castle. Did I use my guns? What the fuck is making that sound?
[11727.30s -> 11739.53s]  Escape the castle. I have, hold on. I have the Demetrius key, right? Isn't there another Demetrius
[11739.53s -> 11758.73s]  Udor right there? No. I swear to God, this is another Demetrius Udor literally right behind me.
[11759.29s -> 11785.98s]  All right. Where's the big, where's that fat guy? I need him. Everybody's spoiling. Spoiling what?
[11785.98s -> 11788.94s]  I'm not even looking at chat. If you're sending me that they will look out for spoilers,
[11788.94s -> 11792.22s]  spoiler alert. I'm not looking at the fucking chat for like at least 20 minutes.
[11792.86s -> 11811.43s]  Oh, nice castle map. Opera Hall. Can I go in? I can't go in the Opera Hall. I'm not looking.
[11811.43s -> 11827.11s]  I don't want to see. Let me actually, I need to do some crafting here. Yeah, give me another one.
[11827.11s -> 11833.29s]  How's my health? Am I okay? Please be aware, the mistress's lipstick is missing. If anyone
[11833.29s -> 11837.13s]  finds it, could they please return it to her bathroom? It is custom made and therefore very
[11837.13s -> 11889.22s]  expensive. I mean that, what's this? What's that Metroid thing? Three girls have stopped moving.
[11889.22s -> 11894.98s]  They see Momo's dead. An insect flew out of the eldest's mouth. It appears to be a common fly.
[11895.70s -> 11900.44s]  Three days since treatment, all three bodies are covered in flies. It appears the flies
[11900.44s -> 12397.00s]  are consuming their flesh. When I opened, I got a pee. I'll be right back. I'm back. I'm back.
[12397.56s -> 12403.66s]  I dropped a coffee on the ground. I dropped it on the ground and it was, it was a disaster.
[12404.22s -> 12414.14s]  Toilet. Yeah, the toilet got clogged. I had to plunge the toilet. It was, it was a joke.
[12414.14s -> 12423.30s]  You're lucky I wasn't gone for 40 minutes, but I'm ready to get back into it. Let's go.
[12428.22s -> 12437.96s]  Oh, I got a question for all you PC enthusiasts here. So, so I have a 3090 and this thing is loud
[12438.68s -> 12450.26s]  and runs hot. How hard is it to like put a new heat, like a heat sink on this? Like should I
[12450.26s -> 12458.28s]  get like a water cooling system for the GPU? Because this thing is going like it sounds like
[12458.28s -> 12475.38s]  a jet engine in here. Clean the fans. I mean, this is a, this is literally brand new. What 3090 is it?
[12476.42s -> 12483.62s]  Um, I don't know if honestly it was, all these graphics supplies are in such a low supply
[12483.62s -> 12489.21s]  that it just, whatever one was available, I bought it. I don't even know what the brand is. Let me
[12489.21s -> 12518.90s]  see who the brand is. Zotac? Is Zotac gaming? Zotac? I don't know. What's Zotac? I knew it.
[12519.64s -> 12528.95s]  Those are the only ones that are available. What do you want me to do? Zotac is one of the brands.
[12528.95s -> 12533.11s]  Yeah. Zotac is fine. Yeah. People are saying Zotac is good. Zotac is fine. Yeah. Zotac is
[12533.11s -> 12538.65s]  fucking fine. What's wrong with Zotac? I haven't had any problems with it. The only problem I have
[12538.65s -> 12543.21s]  is that I think it's a little loud. Like the fans. I just get to take the heat sink off,
[12543.21s -> 12547.75s]  put a new one on. I mean, if you're going to have a 3090, 3090 is literally like,
[12547.75s -> 12553.03s]  like a down payment on a house. Like it's like I'm buying a car. So like I may as well like
[12553.59s -> 12570.15s]  pony up to put like a liquid cooling system on it, right? I'm going back. 3090 is run,
[12570.15s -> 12587.98s]  just, just run hot. I got another fake Fiji. Why do you stream in 720p? Because I have only had
[12587.98s -> 12597.02s]  a 3090 in the computer like three hours. Sorry. It's been like a little bit longer, but whatever.
[12597.02s -> 12603.48s]  It's been like a little while, whatever. All right. All three bodies have almost completely
[12603.48s -> 12608.52s]  consumed by the insects. Insects eat people. It's just afternoon and the insects just started eating.
[12608.52s -> 12614.60s]  Those around the face turned pale and the lips turned red. The massive insects have transformed
[12614.60s -> 12619.40s]  into human bodies again. All three girls are woke looking at me like newborns. I sense a bond
[12619.40s -> 12629.08s]  between us like mother and daughters. I've already decided their names. Flies are turning into people.
[12629.88s -> 12645.94s]  Okay. Interesting. Every Zotac fan, uh, card I've bought had the fans die. Um, I mean,
[12645.94s -> 12650.65s]  that's kind of anecdotal evidence I think, but I mean, still they are pretty, they're,
[12650.65s -> 12653.69s]  they are turning right now, but it's just so hot in here. I gotta like get,
[12653.69s -> 12658.01s]  I gotta figure out a solution. All right. Escape the castle. Let's just go whatever I was doing
[12671.29s -> 12694.76s]  and go, bingo. Running out of bullets. This is bad. Need bullets. There's a big piano. Oh,
[12694.76s -> 12738.01s]  wait, this is a piano. Can I play the piano? Yes. Okay. You didn't even look at the stage.
[12738.01s -> 12757.10s]  What do you mean? What stage? Oh, we've got the iron key. Oh, all right. It's an opera.
[12757.10s -> 12761.02s]  The fan curve using Zotac software. You're running at a 10, you were running at 1080p.
[12761.02s -> 12765.34s]  You can make it quiet for a thermal ceiling of 78 degrees Celsius. That's good to know. Thank you.
[12766.65s -> 12776.87s]  Probably use that. All right. So the iron key, there are a few iron doors.
[12777.67s -> 12783.80s]  It's still in here though. All right. Looking for iron doors. Where's an iron door?
[12784.36s -> 12794.60s]  There are no iron doors here. There's an iron door down in like that like weird chamber place,
[12795.32s -> 12804.50s]  which is this way. All right. We'll go in there. Just spit on it. It would go,
[12805.46s -> 12810.82s]  that wouldn't do anything. That'd be banned that fucking person. Seriously. What are you talking
[12810.82s -> 12836.12s]  about? Odd. Okay. I need to go this way, right? Cause then I need to go down here, right? That's
[12836.12s -> 12876.76s]  an iron key, isn't it? Oh my God. It's Lady Dimitra. Who the fuck am I into the courtyard? Let's go.
[12877.48s -> 12900.78s]  Does she come down here? They really do have swords and shit. They really are dark souls enemies.

[17404.84s -> 17406.20s]  I do actually
[17406.20s -> 17410.10s]  Reminds me of resident evil 4. It's like a first person resident evil 4
[17410.74s -> 17425.40s]  Which is pretty cool. I like it said the game name. I did say the game name. You're right. That's seven bullets. Holy shit
[17425.48s -> 17426.92s]  Okay, that's good
[17426.92s -> 17432.39s]  Anything else in here? No play postal two
[17433.03s -> 17437.92s]  Postal two not portal to one. I think you were talking to somebody in chat and I just answered
[17438.56s -> 17441.19s]  All right. Wait, there's something else in there
[17441.51s -> 17444.32s]  What else could possibly be in here?

[17506.18s -> 17515.76s]  This isn't open
[17515.76s -> 17523.64s]  Okay. Well, here's the house
[17523.64s -> 17526.12s]  Walk from the other side. Okay. Well now what?
[17526.60s -> 17538.12s]  What the fuck to go all the way around? That was a pretty chimney was pretty. Yeah
[17538.92s -> 17541.78s]  Okay, settle down
[17541.78s -> 17551.06s]  No pain. Nope. Everything's locked from the other side
[17558.36s -> 17564.21s]  What is that?
[17564.21s -> 17565.49s]  I climb this
[17565.49s -> 17575.64s]  How do I go?
[17575.64s -> 17580.23s]  Through here
[17580.23s -> 17582.23s]  Let's go. He's on the grind
[17582.79s -> 17600.74s]  I can't go that way
[17600.74s -> 17602.34s]  There's stuff in here
[17602.34s -> 17606.34s]  I heard a scream from the house with the chimney. I was going to take a look but the way was blocked by debris
[17606.98s -> 17608.98s]  Going to have to take the long way around
[17609.14s -> 17612.47s]  Who would have thought the hole in the stable walls would come in handy?
[17613.03s -> 17621.91s]  If i'm not back by morning, you should go to louise's house
[17623.38s -> 17627.64s]  On the stable walls, he said portal makes him feel sick. It does
[17629.65s -> 17631.17s]  Oh it does
[17631.17s -> 17633.17s]  It makes me feel like shit when I play it
[17638.45s -> 17639.97s]  Debris
[17639.97s -> 17642.18s]  How would you say it?
[17642.18s -> 17643.70s]  Debris
[17643.70s -> 17645.70s]  The different debris debris

[17666.50s -> 17667.64s]  Debris
[17667.64s -> 17670.77s]  You're lucky I didn't say debris to make you all fucking flip out
[17671.57s -> 17675.92s]  Okay, that's a little shortcut good
[17676.56s -> 17682.52s]  It's in here anything there is
[17692.24s -> 17708.88s]  Anything nope, okay, we need to go to the house with the chimney
[17710.76s -> 17712.92s]  And seek out the raven or whatever his name is
[17713.48s -> 17715.97s]  You could possibly move this somehow
[17716.05s -> 17734.37s]  You can move the tractor with something. What's this doing here? What is that doing there?
[17739.08s -> 17741.08s]  crazy frog moment
[17750.28s -> 17762.39s]  Do not enter do not enter crazy frogs workshop. Well, what's in the workshop?
[17765.73s -> 17767.80s]  What's going on
[17767.80s -> 17775.57s]  I love that so much. It's like my favorite thing in the world. So what's going on is my favorite sound effect
[17775.65s -> 17781.01s]  I think
[17781.01s -> 17783.81s]  It's up there. It could be it's really high. Whatever it is
[17785.28s -> 17787.28s]  Uh, this is a guy. It's like iron man

[17894.94s -> 17898.86s]  a jack handle
[17898.86s -> 17900.86s]  That's a new weapon. Hold on a second
[17902.59s -> 17909.01s]  Holy automatic handgun. This thing's fucking awesome. All right, I want to put this equip this
[17915.12s -> 17923.33s]  Shortcut to here. This is it. Nice. Okay, cool
[17924.13s -> 17928.96s]  Holy automatic
[17928.96s -> 17932.24s]  It is whoa. What that's weird. I don't know if i'm gonna like this
[17933.66s -> 17935.66s]  I'm, not sure i'm gonna actually like this
[17935.74s -> 17947.58s]  All right, let's go back to the well over here
[17953.20s -> 17965.65s]  what
[17965.65s -> 17967.65s]  Shoot him with some shoot somebody
[17967.65s -> 17969.09s]  What am I doing?
[17969.09s -> 17995.60s]  I don't notice my voice is going like a lot recently. You notice that when I get really excited. It's like
[17997.60s -> 17999.60s]  It's really I don't know what's going on I think i'm getting older
[17999.84s -> 18010.13s]  He's some kind of item I think I have I have one and he's an other item don't I have one
[18010.45s -> 18012.21s]  It's like it's the jack, right?
[18012.21s -> 18024.82s]  I'm gonna have the jack this seems some kind of other item. I don't understand
[18025.54s -> 18040.72s]  Oh, maybe it's for the tractor. Yeah, it probably is for the tractor. You're right. All right, let's go
[18043.34s -> 18045.34s]  It's locked from the other side
[18047.58s -> 18055.36s]  Get up
[18055.36s -> 18060.16s]  All right. This same guy is just following me and pretending to be dead in different places
[18060.80s -> 18075.95s]  No, I feel I feel like i've seen this guy lying down dead like at every other scene not anymore
[18084.32s -> 18086.88s]  What the fuck the guy's fucking following me around
[18094.00s -> 18096.00s]  What the fuck my girlfriend's sleeping. You woke her up
[18097.41s -> 18099.41s]  Dude, we watch together
[18100.30s -> 18103.63s]  What are you talking about?
[18103.71s -> 18106.11s]  Well, what you're not watching together now, are you?
[18106.75s -> 18111.52s]  These sounds are so loud. It's so loud. Isn't it?
[18112.16s -> 18117.12s]  This game's too it's too loud for you guys a big strong loud blow up explosion noises happen all the time
[18117.52s -> 18126.00s]  I keep looking over here and i'm getting just drowned out. No, you know what it is
[18126.56s -> 18128.00s]  It's this
[18128.00s -> 18145.33s]  That's the problem. Okay. Now i'm good. I'm good now this can come back up. All right turn on rage
[18145.33s -> 18147.33s]  All right, I will turn ray tracing on
[18147.89s -> 18149.89s]  Like it I didn't see this guy
[18159.97s -> 18181.50s]  Fully automatic I wouldn't classify. This is fully automatic. All right, go this way. Wait, hold on any items
[18184.05s -> 18194.39s]  It's fully completely semi-automatic. It's fully completely kind of semi-automatic
[18197.89s -> 18208.80s]  I realistically I probably shouldn't even use it though
[18213.76s -> 18219.81s]  Because this is more powerful and until I upgrade it. It's probably not worth using the bullets with it, right?
[18220.43s -> 18226.71s]  Theoretically is a pig of animals nice in this game
[18233.38s -> 18235.46s]  All right, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I mean it didn't even hurt me
[18235.54s -> 18239.25s]  I'm not I don't have to kill it. Is it do I have to kill it? What can I feed it?
[18241.99s -> 18246.98s]  You eating the blood
[18246.98s -> 18264.05s]  You like is it good? It's a good pig. I pet him. He was just scared. I didn't know why would I shoot it?
[18264.45s -> 18290.90s]  I don't know nothing in here. Whatever. Okay. Well, I don't have a lot anymore lockpicks. So I got a
[18291.86s -> 18318.74s]  Chicken over there. Wait, why are these listed here? Why is there a chicken here? All right. I need to go to the chimney house
[18318.74s -> 18334.53s]  Where is it? It's over here. Go this way. All right, I gotta go back here. It's meat. Wait, I actually get meat from the pig
[18338.96s -> 18354.34s]  Really? You shitting me? Did I actually do that? Don't kill it. But I mean is it does it actually help?
[18354.90s -> 18370.05s]  You know, you're not gonna do the same thing, right? I don't want to kill the pig. It's gonna give meat
[18371.94s -> 18375.59s]  Pick a blt
[18375.59s -> 18381.03s]  I can't do it. I'll rather have a harder game. I can't do it. He's just hanging out. There's nothing. What did he do?
[18382.36s -> 18396.23s]  What did he do wrong? He rammed you. No, I startled him and then he freaked out
[18396.31s -> 18398.31s]  He had he ran at me because he was scared
[18398.47s -> 18403.27s]  All right. Here we go
[18403.27s -> 18405.27s]  You're on the roof. You're on the roof. Okay
[18410.04s -> 18418.68s]  That actually does that make them? Oh my god, i'm trying to shoot them both at the same time
[18426.71s -> 18429.99s]  He slipped he just slipped and exploded his head on the ground
[18430.71s -> 18438.05s]  I feel like I didn't even do that
[18438.05s -> 18444.72s]  All right. This is the house, right? No, it's not but might as well just look around
[18449.11s -> 18452.72s]  White bomb good
[18452.72s -> 18457.52s]  You'll kill zombies, but you won't kill the pig. The zombies are actively attacking me to trying to kill me
[18458.42s -> 18460.42s]  The pig ran by me and screamed
[18460.98s -> 18474.64s]  If that pig kept attacking me, you better believe I would have
[18475.86s -> 18477.86s]  That guy looks a little different
[18482.95s -> 18504.44s]  Is that hurting him? Holy shit. That guy took a lot of hits
[18506.69s -> 18509.44s]  perfect crystal skull
[18509.52s -> 18511.52s]  It's man bear pig
[18516.90s -> 18535.11s]  It kind of looks like what's that sign say lock due to missing homeowner. Hold on not yet open this
[18535.91s -> 18541.48s]  Oh, where's the door closing? Was the door closing? Whatever. Okay. I want to open this
[18553.49s -> 18556.37s]  Use the fucking knife. I have guns. Why would I use a knife?
[18559.96s -> 18565.24s]  Finally, I have the wheel well it took long enough took five plus hours into the game to get this item
[18565.80s -> 18572.39s]  All right. I'm gonna
[18572.39s -> 18575.99s]  I want to go use it
[18575.99s -> 18582.56s]  Back here, right?
[18582.56s -> 18584.56s]  All right, there's one well here

[18630.90s -> 18633.38s]  I'm not killing any of the animals unless they attack first
[18634.02s -> 18637.14s]  except for the fish because I thought they were mutants
[18646.68s -> 18650.77s]  wheel well and
[18651.62s -> 18653.62s]  Lockpick, okay, there's one

[19238.48s -> 19241.91s]  That's the goal. That's what we're doing. That's what i'm doing. I'm going to the house with the red chimney
[19241.91s -> 19243.11s]  That's what i'm doing
[19243.11s -> 19248.21s]  House with the red chimney is I fuck I've I don't know
[19248.77s -> 19255.08s]  Looks like we have to go back this way. It's blocked by trees. We have to go over here
[19261.33s -> 19265.30s]  No back through the church through the door down here
[19265.94s -> 19281.41s]  It's confusing. It is
[19288.64s -> 19290.64s]  It's confusing if you can't read a map
[19291.04s -> 19292.16s]  Look, dude
[19292.16s -> 19298.00s]  It's like half of these things are blocked half of them are blocked by my it's i'm playing a maze here
[19298.16s -> 19300.56s]  It's you have to just one step by step
[19301.04s -> 19310.55s]  It's it's difficult. It's not easy to read this half of these roads are blocked. Look, man
[19313.00s -> 19316.00s]  All right, i'm going
[19316.00s -> 19322.42s]  Down here and then like around here and through here. Okay, straight ahead. Let's go
[19325.25s -> 19328.29s]  And it doesn't look like the same thing way that look it's this is it's blocked
[19328.69s -> 19331.92s]  This is block. It's blocked up. Okay, so and now I can't go this way
[19332.77s -> 19341.68s]  Read the map andy, right? It's blocked half of them are locked from the other side
[19346.39s -> 19347.59s]  This is locked
[19347.59s -> 19364.48s]  I gotta go through here and then like where the fuck am I going?
[19364.72s -> 19384.96s]  I have to get back to like the place with the pig and some places you have to go through houses
[19385.12s -> 19398.37s]  Okay, hold on. Can I like get through this way? No, what I all right i'm going down this way and
[19398.85s -> 19409.67s]  How do I how did I get here?
[19410.52s -> 19416.85s]  Through here through here. This is blocked. I gotta go down. I can't go through here
[19417.17s -> 19423.84s]  This way that way this way that way is he high or something this map is fucking this map is dog shit
[19424.24s -> 19432.98s]  You can't get I can't give a shit map and then be like why we didn't go to the birthday party
[19433.06s -> 19435.06s]  This is because your directions were fucking terrible
[19435.14s -> 19442.08s]  Remember back like 20 years ago 15 years ago those of you that drove like 20 years ago 15 years ago
[19442.56s -> 19446.87s]  Before gps people used to give you the most absurd directions
[19447.43s -> 19451.91s]  Oh at the fourth light you'll look over there'll be a clown and take a left at the clown and there's no clown
[19452.23s -> 19457.38s]  There's absolutely no fucking clown and there's like 12 lights and you don't know which one to take the left at
[19458.39s -> 19479.22s]  I remember looking at directions that were written out. It was like 75 steps and I I can't go this way
[19479.46s -> 19488.55s]  This is locked. Can I like go through here?
[19489.27s -> 19491.99s]  And like out that where do I go?
[19492.63s -> 19496.23s]  How do I get out of here? I'm fucking trapped
[19496.87s -> 19506.90s]  I'm trapped here. There's one little specific route. I have to take through this fucking map
[19513.24s -> 19517.25s]  You keep turning at the clown there is no clown this way
[19517.49s -> 19526.18s]  No, and I would love to zoom out but I can't everything disappears. All right, settle down relax
[19533.30s -> 19535.94s]  I am gonna lose my mind. How do I get over here?
[19539.32s -> 19547.43s]  I can't go this way. So I have to go straight and then right and then
[19549.25s -> 19555.78s]  Back to where you got the wheel. I have no idea where that is right from where you are now
[19558.71s -> 19560.71s]  It's blocked off with a fucking wagon
[19561.67s -> 19580.56s]  Flying back under the tractor. I don't even know where that fucking tractor is man. Oh shit
[19580.56s -> 19594.79s]  It's like there's a fucking diamond in here teddy bear. I hit the jackpot down here. Okay now
[19599.56s -> 19628.58s]  Look at the statue. Nice. There's the red chimney left of the wagon
[19660.24s -> 19685.11s]  Where the where is somebody hack my computer and just do it for me. Oh
[19686.15s -> 19692.68s]  Why is it this confusing?
[19693.56s -> 19695.56s]  This should just be able to walk down the path
[19696.58s -> 19718.74s]  Why can't I just walk down a path go through the shack? This shit isn't even on the map
[19719.06s -> 19728.60s]  It's not even on the map. Okay. All right
[19729.00s -> 19741.92s]  Great. Now I gotta go through this shit and then like back around this
[19743.20s -> 19749.92s]  I'm gonna shock out of no i'm not relax
[19750.16s -> 19762.87s]  I just walked around in like three circles to do if I could just walk just over here
[19763.03s -> 19767.36s]  Oh
[19767.84s -> 19769.84s]  And go through the shack which oh
[19770.66s -> 19788.36s]  Through the door back to the window. Oh, I've got a little window through the door. Okay
[19789.00s -> 19796.47s]  What I fucking made it? I I can't even go in this door. I can't go in here. Oh my god

[19867.80s -> 19870.68s]  Yeah, wait, do I have to go back around and get on the ladder again?
[19871.16s -> 19882.68s]  Go through the house. Everything's just confusing me. I'm so confused right now
[19882.92s -> 19888.04s]  Every door is locked from the how many fucking doors are locked from the other side
[19889.67s -> 19893.67s]  Half of the shit in this game is locked. Everything's locked. What are these people doing in their houses?
[19894.31s -> 19916.60s]  Maybe that crystal i'm just throwing a fucking grenade into the chimney. All right, I made it i'm in your house
[19917.08s -> 19941.38s]  Who's in here? Do you not lock your door?
[19943.17s -> 19948.68s]  I what the fuck every door is locked from the other side. Everything's locked
[19949.32s -> 19953.01s]  Okay, is somebody this i'm so i'm just where is this person?
[19953.65s -> 19961.06s]  Oh my fucking god, it's gonna be like another the winged key is just a single piece three more parts
[19961.06s -> 19969.33s]  Are needed to make it a whole. Oh, no wing key is just one single piece three more parts are needed
[19971.12s -> 19973.12s]  combined with the winged key
[19973.28s -> 19977.84s]  I don't even know what I just did. Damn it. Better see the duke again
[19978.08s -> 19982.74s]  Oh god, I have to leave I have to leave I have to get out of the house
[19983.38s -> 19985.92s]  I have to go back to the duke
[19987.16s -> 19989.88s]  Who is over here? Oh, this is simple. Just walk out the door
[19990.44s -> 19999.89s]  Where is he this way?
[19999.89s -> 20002.58s]  Over here. All right. I'm good
[20004.24s -> 20009.97s]  Oh, you're an idiot. This map sucks. This game sucks. I'm kidding. It's a joke. Relax everybody
[20013.84s -> 20016.08s]  How was it? Did you learn anything?
[20016.64s -> 20022.10s]  I found these feathers now. Tell me how to fix this like you said you would settle i'm kidding
[20022.10s -> 20026.82s]  The game's fun first. You must use that key and collect all of your little roses flasks
[20028.02s -> 20030.02s]  Where are the rest of them?
[20030.42s -> 20032.42s]  There are four in total
[20032.42s -> 20035.62s]  You have the one and the other lords have the rest
[20036.58s -> 20041.40s]  lords
[20041.40s -> 20047.96s]  Mother miranda is the cold calculating ruler of this village four lords serve under her
[20049.94s -> 20052.76s]  The first you've already met the lady demetresque
[20054.50s -> 20060.44s]  The second lives deep in a valley of mist the dollmaker donna beneviento
[20063.20s -> 20067.68s]  Getting the hub world her playmates have ever come back from that dank old estate
[20072.20s -> 20077.88s]  The third is morrow a being of twisted flesh that lives in the reservoir past the windmills
[20078.28s -> 20083.48s]  He's pretty weak just one shotgun blast to his face. We'll do it in those waters
[20087.68s -> 20094.00s]  The fourth and most dangerous is heisenberg. He works in his factory on the village outskirts
[20094.56s -> 20097.22s]  the project
[20097.22s -> 20101.14s]  Let's just say parts of the human imagination are better left alone
[20111.08s -> 20116.07s]  Oh, okay. So we already claimed lady demetre
[20117.91s -> 20119.43s]  Now we need to go

[20222.50s -> 20235.17s]  Okay, inspect the teddy bear
[20235.17s -> 20239.73s]  I don't think it's
[20239.73s -> 20245.32s]  naturally

[20361.35s -> 20365.67s]  Oh my god, I can't believe that I was so concerned about like killing the pig
[20368.34s -> 20371.30s]  All right. Well, um, let's do this one because I can make it
[20376.45s -> 20379.24s]  Okay, two two, right? Yes

[20422.66s -> 20427.46s]  Shotgun ammo capacity on the shotgun. Yes one moment, please and reload speed. Thank you
[20428.58s -> 20430.98s]  And let's make the sniper rifle more powerful. Yes
[20431.62s -> 20438.32s]  Sounds good to me. I'm skilled at all sorts of weapons modifications and we'll do them for a small fee
[20438.64s -> 20441.52s]  You know what? Let's just just i'm just gonna buy a shitload. Just give me more rounds
[20443.36s -> 20449.36s]  What are you eyeing that one have a wonderful adventure? Thank you
[20450.88s -> 20453.36s]  Uh, I need to do some organization here
[20454.08s -> 20639.32s]  I gotta pee though. I'll be right back pee time. All right
[20642.15s -> 20647.09s]  so
[20647.09s -> 20651.64s]  Does anybody know i'm assuming i'm probably almost at the halfway point of the game
[20652.28s -> 20658.12s]  If I do one of these areas and I get two of four i'm assuming that's probably somewhere around halfway
[20660.98s -> 20668.20s]  maybe
[20668.20s -> 20670.20s]  so if I get another
[20670.20s -> 20672.23s]  piece of
[20672.23s -> 20677.03s]  Rose and that would be somewhere with that would be 33 percent
[20677.75s -> 20681.92s]  Let's let's we're going here's what we're gonna do
[20683.59s -> 20685.59s]  That'd be about 40 percent
[20695.97s -> 20701.33s]  Lady dimitrisu is about third of the way through the game. All right, so if i'm gonna get one more piece of rose
[20702.74s -> 20706.42s]  From one of these areas and then we'll see where we are, but we will finish it tomorrow
[20706.90s -> 20717.09s]  All right. Let me fix my inventory. What's this? Oh shit. This is the extra space. Nice. All right
[20717.09s -> 20726.72s]  Well, we're gonna put weapons over here
[20726.72s -> 20728.72s]  All guns all weapons all ammo
[20729.43s -> 20734.04s]  No, what are you doing? Oh
[20734.44s -> 20739.28s]  Okay, that's just to organize. I thought it was an extra backpack
[20739.76s -> 20746.80s]  First of all, let me read
[20746.80s -> 20749.56s]  Wait, what am I all my weapons are gone
[20749.72s -> 20751.24s]  Let me reload everything
[20751.24s -> 20756.10s]  Everything reloaded. Yes. All right
[20757.30s -> 20765.30s]  Okay, so we're gonna do weapons down here weapons on the right. That sounds good to me
[20773.03s -> 20776.64s]  uh, okay
[20776.64s -> 20779.68s]  Type bombs up here and the knife will spin it this way up here
[20780.40s -> 20782.77s]  This game's really good. I like this game a lot
[20783.64s -> 20785.80s]  Turn off your lights. No, but you won't be able to see me
[20787.60s -> 20789.60s]  I i'm it'll be just dark
[20790.36s -> 20792.36s]  Lights off you're not gonna be able to even see me
[20800.76s -> 20802.52s]  You don't want it like this
[20802.52s -> 20805.28s]  This sucks
[20805.28s -> 20807.28s]  And this sucks to play
[20807.68s -> 20817.00s]  I don't like this at all. Actually. I hate this. This is good. It's not good because i'm playing a video game in a dark room
[20818.31s -> 20835.91s]  No, i'm putting it back on i'm putting no. No, we're not doing that. It's scare saturdays
[20836.61s -> 20838.56s]  Yes, I know
[20838.56s -> 20842.32s]  All right. Let me get back to this. I really like this game. I'm gonna give this game an 8.6 right now
[20843.04s -> 20845.04s]  At this at this stage right now
[20845.12s -> 20850.32s]  It would be like an 8 9 or like an 8 8 at the moment if the fov was scalable
[20850.72s -> 20853.60s]  And if I didn't just get stuck and beg somebody to fucking help me
[20854.40s -> 20859.44s]  Be an 8 6 at the moment. It's really bad for your eyes. Yeah, I know it is. It's horrible for you
[20859.44s -> 20861.44s]  It's like really helpful for you. It's bad for your brain
[20863.65s -> 20867.17s]  All right handgun with the handgun shotgun with the shotgun
[20867.89s -> 20875.00s]  Shotgun with the shotgun, of course
[20877.48s -> 20880.45s]  Handgun with the handgun
[20880.45s -> 20883.41s]  This is magnum. I don't have a magnum, but whatever I guess
[20885.89s -> 20887.89s]  Uh, we'll put the health in the top right
[20890.79s -> 20892.88s]  meat down here
[20892.88s -> 20895.60s]  Magnum ammo is gonna go with the pistol just because why not
[20896.24s -> 20897.84s]  lock picks up here
[20897.84s -> 20899.60s]  explosive rounds
[20899.60s -> 20904.87s]  Up here right here. Yeah right here much better. All right, I like it good
[20908.44s -> 20910.44s]  But where's the sniper ammo?
[20910.68s -> 20917.73s]  I don't have any clean. This is clean. Wait, hold on
[20922.53s -> 20924.84s]  That's better. I like that better. Okay
[20926.87s -> 20939.80s]  Upright what about I have a magnum. Where's my mag? I don't have a magnum
[20946.23s -> 20949.40s]  Okay, that's better. I'm ready. So where should I go?
[20949.96s -> 20957.94s]  The treasure over here peaceful. Haley just gives 10 community subs
[20958.58s -> 20964.10s]  Thanks for the community subs peaceful. Haley. All right. I said that like let me let me do that better. Thanks for the 10
[20965.06s -> 20967.14s]  Community subs i'm not turning
[20968.80s -> 20973.44s]  I promised I wasn't gonna get angry. I wasn't gonna get angry today. I already broke that promise like three times
[20974.00s -> 20976.23s]  All right
[20976.23s -> 20979.84s]  Who do I want to go to?
[20979.84s -> 20982.16s]  I kind of want to go to like the weird little doll thing
[20983.57s -> 20985.57s]  That's where I want to go. I want to go to the doll
[20985.65s -> 20997.30s]  We're an rtx on I will before the stream turns off. I promise. Hey ink cat. Thanks for the five community subs
[20998.34s -> 21002.18s]  You know what so
[21002.34s -> 21005.09s]  That is up
[21005.09s -> 21011.06s]  Here down here. I'm assuming it's probably just up this way
[21013.94s -> 21020.90s]  This way dim the lights. I don't have a dimmer. I can't dim my lights
[21029.12s -> 21031.12s]  This is a good game though. I like this a lot
[21032.12s -> 21038.50s]  So far, this is better than resident evil 7 if I were to give you a comparison so far
[21040.13s -> 21044.53s]  Resident evil 7 was really fun for the first like two or three hours and then I kind of just thought the game was boring
[21045.09s -> 21049.32s]  This has been consistently still pretty good
[21051.54s -> 21053.54s]  All right, here we go. We're going towards
[21054.26s -> 21056.26s]  this little doll thing
[21057.64s -> 21060.20s]  Please move. I'm gonna get attacked by dolls. Aren't I?
[21077.03s -> 21079.03s]  I thought that was a stormtrooper helmet
[21079.96s -> 21085.72s]  Like right here. I'm not turning my lights off
[21088.04s -> 21110.31s]  No, the lights stay on
[21110.31s -> 21115.33s]  Ethan come with me. There's something I have to tell you. Mia. Yeah
[21116.13s -> 21118.58s]  What's going on? What's going on?
[21121.19s -> 21123.35s]  Don't don't let me I don't want to miss that treasure
[21127.04s -> 21135.32s]  Don't let me miss that treasure don't open
[21140.40s -> 21142.40s]  Ethan you have to fix her
[21143.30s -> 21145.30s]  Okay, i'll try
[21146.96s -> 21150.32s]  Heck dude, what the heck is this? Don't be so offensive to me
[21155.94s -> 21157.38s]  This can't be real
[21157.38s -> 21165.83s]  I'm gonna invest in a lamp you absolute man. I don't want to live recess lighting. I don't want a lamp
[21166.71s -> 21177.41s]  All right. Here's the treasure
[21177.41s -> 21179.49s]  a
[21179.65s -> 21186.07s]  Viento 1987 to 1996 freed from the binds of flesh. She now walks the valley of death
[21191.19s -> 21195.92s]  Beneviento's treasure
[21195.92s -> 21206.28s]  Losing it. I don't think I can open this yet. I can't open that. I think it probably probably opens when I like kill beneviento
[21218.63s -> 21220.31s]  Put it in the mail slot
[21220.31s -> 21228.69s]  What's going on? Oh, what the fuck? Okay. That was very strange
[21230.40s -> 21233.68s]  Yeah, i'll do this. I'm gonna like make it so the uh
[21234.40s -> 21237.33s]  Let me just change this so like the it's not gonna ready
[21237.97s -> 21242.18s]  I'll darken it
[21242.18s -> 21252.29s]  There i'm making some people go. Okay. All right. Finally finally we can see
[21253.91s -> 21259.14s]  Now I well that's just making me look like it's like turning into a silhouette
[21265.88s -> 21269.65s]  Should I be like hold on ready?
[21269.65s -> 21270.93s]  Hold on. Give me a second
[21270.93s -> 21276.71s]  Like i'm i'm like one of those people that's just like blacked out doing one of those interviews
[21276.71s -> 21280.95s]  But they don't want you to know who they are, but i'm screaming. I'm a streamer. I just don't want you to know
[21292.24s -> 21294.24s]  Okay, so uh
[21294.48s -> 21298.26s]  Let's take a uh quick
[21310.42s -> 21311.70s]  Okay
[21311.70s -> 21315.94s]  That sounds pretty good
[21315.94s -> 21317.70s]  Imagine watching
[21317.70s -> 21319.78s]  Imagine watching this fucking stream. Hold on
[21331.20s -> 21333.52s]  Uh, like like for privacy purposes
[21334.40s -> 21349.43s]  That's good
[21349.43s -> 21370.23s]  So i'm just gonna stream like that

[21397.25s -> 21399.25s]  Just say he was he was a fucking timer
[21402.08s -> 21404.08s]  And i'm not saying that because we're playing resident evil
[21404.48s -> 21406.92s]  He really was saying he was a timer. He was a terrible guy
[21407.56s -> 21411.43s]  You're not gonna we're not gonna use this anywhere, right? We're gonna make you make sure nobody can hear me

[28003.19s -> 28007.67s]  I hope it doesn't break. The only other one we have is at the windmill over at windmill two
[28012.64s -> 28015.84s]  Well, where's when this is windmill one? Where's windmill two?
[28016.56s -> 28022.88s]  over there
[28022.88s -> 28036.87s]  gonna break
[28037.74s -> 28040.39s]  Seriously
[28040.39s -> 28042.79s]  Why would it have not broken? Of course, it's gonna break
[28043.43s -> 28060.50s]  There are chickens go back
[28060.50s -> 28063.84s]  And I think i'm gonna officially call it
[28064.64s -> 28069.96s]  Starting to get really tired. I'm starting i'm starting to like i'm starting to get tired
[28074.12s -> 28076.12s]  I will be back here tomorrow
[28077.46s -> 28084.24s]  Uh, let me do let me actually do this first. Let's go get the chickens. Yeah, i'm getting tired
[28084.80s -> 28092.05s]  I can feel it waving over me and i'm not I don't I we'll just pick up tomorrow. So theoretically
[28092.93s -> 28095.89s]  I should tomorrow as long as I don't
[28096.69s -> 28099.46s]  stall andy
[28099.46s -> 28101.76s]  I should be able to
[28101.76s -> 28108.07s]  um
[28108.07s -> 28110.07s]  Did you survive the gunshot?
[28110.23s -> 28112.23s]  Oh my god kills chicken
[28112.71s -> 28126.24s]  I think I have enough another fan's not gonna work tomorrow. Do not jinx me like that, please
[28130.00s -> 28133.12s]  I I should be at like the halfway mark. You think i'll be able to do it tomorrow?
[28133.68s -> 28139.43s]  If I do like another solid like five to six hours tomorrow, you think i'll finish the game. I should I should right?
[28139.75s -> 28144.80s]  I get this guy the hammer guy and then whatever the last part of the game is. Yeah. Yeah, that's
[28146.16s -> 28150.61s]  It's easy as long as I don't delay andy. Yeah, I won't
[28151.01s -> 28165.97s]  Yes, I thought he was eating that book, okay good let's make it damage taken when guarding decreases permanently or wait
[28166.29s -> 28173.40s]  I'll still have enough to do this, but i'll need more meat to do this one
[28174.40s -> 28176.72s]  I don't I don't think I I don't I don't think i've guarded once
[28177.76s -> 28180.32s]  So i'm not gonna use it. I'll use it later
[28182.13s -> 28184.13s]  All right, save the game

[28207.72s -> 28209.32s]  rtx on
[28209.32s -> 28229.75s]  Look, I turned this down because I was scared ray tracing. Let's go. It worked ray tracing on. Hi. Hi
[28230.15s -> 28234.13s]  Here we go
[28234.13s -> 28235.73s]  ray tracing on
[28235.73s -> 28277.83s]  Did I not apply it?
[28277.83s -> 28282.02s]  I need a light source
[28282.02s -> 28286.58s]  Is this doing anything?
[28286.58s -> 28299.81s]  I mean that's like kind of cool
[28299.81s -> 28306.58s]  Restarted yeah, it's because there's no like shiny floors. I need a shiny floor to look at
[28308.36s -> 28310.98s]  Yeah, there's no shiny floor to look at

[28317.59s -> 28323.54s]  Shoot the gun
[28323.54s -> 28325.06s]  Whoa, look at that
[28325.06s -> 28335.75s]  Was it doing that before?
[28335.75s -> 28337.75s]  I don't it may have actually been doing that before
[28338.15s -> 28349.84s]  I don't think anything changed
[28349.84s -> 28353.67s]  Just don't save it
[28353.67s -> 28354.55s]  All right
[28354.55s -> 28357.03s]  Uh, we'll try to finish it tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow at two o'clock
[28357.83s -> 28365.51s]  Yes
[28365.51s -> 28367.51s]  Ray tracing looked good
[28369.09s -> 28372.61s]  Yeah, I think would be probably you'd want to do that in like the mansion
[28375.06s -> 28376.90s]  Actually, hold on

[28409.62s -> 28411.06s]  Look really good
[28411.06s -> 28417.38s]  That looks really nice
[28417.38s -> 28425.59s]  Don't let the the auto save might mess up. Oh shit. Will it?
[28429.14s -> 28431.14s]  No, it's not gonna fuck it up, right?
[28433.28s -> 28434.72s]  Yeah, we're good. Okay
[28434.72s -> 28435.76s]  all right
[28435.76s -> 28438.45s]  Let me see if I can do uh
[28438.45s -> 28440.45s]  I'm gonna try to go to 900p
[28440.45s -> 28443.84s]  If I can
[28443.84s -> 28447.68s]  So tomorrow if all goes to plan this will be a 900p stream
[28448.24s -> 28455.46s]  Because I got an I got I gotta be careful though. I I got a replacement of the fans
[28459.08s -> 28460.52s]  Even this looks good, too
[28460.52s -> 28465.94s]  All right. Well, thanks for watching. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Let's try to finish resident evil village
[28466.66s -> 28468.50s]  I ran out of gas
[28468.50s -> 28471.36s]  We'll eat something
[28471.36s -> 28472.48s]  Uh, I
[28472.48s -> 28475.35s]  Sorry said fuck capcom. I don't mean that
[28475.75s -> 28480.07s]  I did very much so at the very beginning of the stream because I can't believe that a company in 2021
[28480.47s -> 28482.47s]  Would put a game on a pc
[28482.63s -> 28486.15s]  And have hard locked the the fucking fov. I don't I find that to be impossible
[28486.95s -> 28489.35s]  It's like they almost like it has to have been done on purpose
[28489.99s -> 28502.21s]  Still the wait the baby was the nascar fuel
[28503.17s -> 28504.93s]  That I just burnt through
[28504.93s -> 28508.87s]  I pretty much did
[28508.87s -> 28511.19s]  I blew out my voice during that segment
[28512.07s -> 28516.95s]  I can't wait to see the embarrassing clips and gifts that i'm gonna feed through in the bath later
[28517.89s -> 28519.89s]  And I cringe in the bathtub
[28520.05s -> 28528.55s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Thanks for watching
[28528.55s -> 28532.39s]  Thanks to all the subs. There were a lot of gifted subs today. I missed a bunch of them. I was very very much
[28534.00s -> 28536.50s]  in the zone here
[28536.50s -> 28544.29s]  Thanks a lot everybody
[28544.29s -> 28546.29s]  I'm now going to eat something to eat
[28547.03s -> 28549.59s]  And shut up and stop talking till tomorrow
[28550.31s -> 28553.43s]  Otherwise, it's gonna be really interesting waking up with a broken voice
[28554.15s -> 28559.08s]  like I was at a
[28559.08s -> 28561.08s]  Soccer game or something. I was just screaming
[28562.00s -> 28565.28s]  No, no, I feel like I was at my son's baseball game
[28566.60s -> 28582.23s]  And I was really really proud of them. It's already great. Yeah, i'm gonna stop talking
[28584.92s -> 28587.40s]  Drink tea. Yeah, i'll have some tea. That sounds good
[28588.04s -> 28594.87s]  All right. I'll give you the my rating of the game so far is still an 8.6. It stays there
[28596.40s -> 28600.32s]  We'll see how it ends. It might drop a few points tomorrow. It might go up a few points. I don't know
[28600.40s -> 28605.65s]  I think it's really good
[28605.65s -> 28611.41s]  Why is it not a 9 because it's locked at 80 fov and I find that to be fucking embarrassing and i'm not afraid to say it
[28625.62s -> 28641.03s]  If the fov mod is like easy to get I might just put it on tomorrow do a raid. Well, let's raid tomorrow
[28641.35s -> 28653.67s]  I feel like it's really late right now. We'll do a raid tomorrow. I'll dump you guys somewhere tomorrow. It's like 3 a.m
[28654.23s -> 28667.75s]  This time it's like 2 3 a.m eastern right now. It's very late
[28670.40s -> 28674.36s]  All right. I'll see you tomorrow. Have a great night
[28674.84s -> 28676.74s]  Goodbye
[28676.74s -> 28683.35s]  Oh my god. All right. I'm not talking anymore. Thanks for sticking around to know
[28683.91s -> 28685.91s]  A lot of you stayed up late. So
[28685.91s -> 28748.93s]  See you tomorrow. Have a good night
