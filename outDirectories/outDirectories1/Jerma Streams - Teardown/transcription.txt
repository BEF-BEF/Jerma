[1.08s -> 4.01s]  What's up? How's everybody doing?
[4.01s -> 13.18s]  Disable Slugpog. That's the first thing you're gonna say to me?
[13.18s -> 16.89s]  Right when I get back? That's the first thing you're gonna say?
[17.99s -> 19.03s]  Not Jerma.
[19.03s -> 20.71s]  Oh, how are you?
[20.71s -> 21.75s]  Jerma, what's up, man?
[22.39s -> 23.66s]  Jerma, how you been?
[29.10s -> 31.02s]  No, what's up? I'm not gonna delete it.
[31.66s -> 32.38s]  Not for a while.
[32.94s -> 34.14s]  Look, here's what's gonna happen.
[34.14s -> 37.50s]  I'm gonna let Slugpog get to the point of the seagull saving,
[38.30s -> 41.42s]  where it was a little funny thing that was enabled for an hour,
[42.30s -> 47.00s]  and then became something that lasted two years,
[47.64s -> 48.92s]  and now I can't delete it.
[49.64s -> 55.00s]  Because now deleting it is, I mean,
[55.00s -> 57.00s]  what about all the people that saved all those seagulls?
[58.60s -> 60.76s]  Now a year from now when I delete Slugpog,
[60.76s -> 63.72s]  or I even mentioned the notion that I'm gonna delete Slugpog,
[63.72s -> 66.36s]  there's gonna be a bunch of Slugpog enthusiasts
[67.32s -> 69.32s]  that are gonna be pissed that I'm even questioning that.
[69.88s -> 75.03s]  Don't let it multiply.
[76.90s -> 79.54s]  Just wait till Slugpog X2 is made.
[83.70s -> 86.98s]  And then Slugpog X3, and then Slugpog X4,
[86.98s -> 88.90s]  until it's like Slugpog X100,
[89.62s -> 91.62s]  and it's just a bunch of fucked up pixels on the screen.
[92.18s -> 99.88s]  Are you feeling better?
[99.88s -> 100.84s]  Yeah, I'm feeling a little better.
[102.44s -> 103.24s]  For those of you that don't know,
[103.24s -> 106.20s]  I didn't plan on not streaming this almost whole week.
[106.92s -> 110.84s]  VR kind of shut me down for a few days.
[111.48s -> 113.72s]  And then I got like stomach problems in the middle of that.
[113.72s -> 114.92s]  So it was kind of a double whammy.
[115.80s -> 118.34s]  But I'm here now.
[118.98s -> 123.21s]  We're gonna be playing Tear Down today.
[123.21s -> 124.65s]  Yeah, it's been recommended a lot.
[125.45s -> 126.73s]  And it looks really good.
[126.73s -> 128.81s]  Now, this might end up being a scenario where,
[128.81s -> 130.98s]  my computer, this is a,
[130.98s -> 132.58s]  is your computer good enough stream?
[132.58s -> 134.82s]  Again, like the third stream in a row.
[138.47s -> 140.39s]  Resident Elect Anthony Vanthony.
[141.59s -> 144.07s]  You know, I saw that image and I thought it was funny.
[144.07s -> 145.67s]  But the one thing that I didn't like,
[145.67s -> 147.19s]  I should have lost my hometown.
[148.68s -> 150.36s]  I should have lost Massachusetts.
[151.08s -> 152.76s]  It's like, I'm from there.
[152.76s -> 154.36s]  And everyone fucking hates me from there.
[155.00s -> 157.00s]  Because the only people that truly know me,
[158.34s -> 160.42s]  and I've somehow convinced the rest of the country,
[161.64s -> 163.64s]  that I'm this good person,
[163.64s -> 165.16s]  or like I'm a good policy maker.
[165.16s -> 167.96s]  The Massachusetts is just in, just done.
[167.96s -> 170.04s]  Oh, the completely, the complete opposite.
[170.68s -> 173.86s]  Or like Hawaii or something.
[173.86s -> 175.70s]  Somehow the Hawaiians just know.
[182.25s -> 183.69s]  You are a bad politician.
[183.69s -> 184.89s]  You have about running for office.
[186.70s -> 187.34s]  I never will.
[188.06s -> 192.38s]  You want to talk about me running for office?
[192.38s -> 195.72s]  Look, my mother has asked me before.
[196.28s -> 199.40s]  It's like, you know, you should like,
[199.40s -> 201.64s]  run for like a local office or something.
[201.64s -> 202.68s]  You can get up on the podium.
[202.68s -> 203.72s]  You can be well-spoken.
[206.26s -> 207.54s]  You have some great ideas.
[208.26s -> 210.95s]  And I'm just thinking like, mom, you don't even understand.
[210.95s -> 212.23s]  The first thing I would do is,
[212.23s -> 215.03s]  I would erect like 15 baloney factories.
[216.22s -> 218.46s]  We would have a baloney-based economy in Las Vegas.
[219.02s -> 220.49s]  That would be bad.
[220.49s -> 222.01s]  I don't think it would be a good idea for me,
[222.01s -> 223.29s]  for the world, the country.
[224.70s -> 227.26s]  But if I were to actually run for president,
[227.26s -> 228.54s]  or run for senator or something,
[229.10s -> 231.42s]  sure, you guys would think it was funny.
[231.42s -> 233.18s]  And a bunch of you might actually vote for me.
[233.18s -> 235.02s]  Most of you wouldn't because it's like, holy shit, no.
[235.90s -> 240.38s]  I'm going to vote for like an e-clown meme machine
[240.38s -> 242.78s]  over a guy that's a politician that knows what he's doing.
[243.82s -> 244.94s]  You would make the joke
[244.94s -> 247.50s]  and maybe like a thousand of you would actually vote for me.
[248.38s -> 249.82s]  Can you imagine the dirt?
[250.38s -> 251.82s]  Can you imagine the ad campaigns?
[253.38s -> 256.98s]  There's so many clips of me saying insane, awful shit.
[257.62s -> 259.37s]  I've talked about like shitting my pants.
[259.37s -> 261.13s]  I've talked about like shitting in my own mouth.
[261.13s -> 264.01s]  I've talked about like, I've like hit myself in the face.
[264.01s -> 265.21s]  I've talked about like eating,
[265.77s -> 267.69s]  like biting the dentist's hand and shit.
[267.69s -> 269.37s]  Like I've said some crazy things.
[270.01s -> 275.56s]  All they even need to do is just play an unedited stream.
[276.97s -> 279.21s]  And I would lose the whole country.
[279.21s -> 288.65s]  You just have to be an unedited stream.
[289.21s -> 291.16s]  And the first time that I turned over and I was like,
[291.16s -> 292.52s]  what did you say?
[292.52s -> 294.68s]  Hey, did it remind me of something?
[294.68s -> 296.28s]  I was in Dunkin' Donuts drive-through
[296.28s -> 298.12s]  and I got double, two of that.
[298.12s -> 300.28s]  And just my demeanor is not good enough.
[308.87s -> 312.95s]  You would have won in 2016.
[317.02s -> 317.82s]  I not anymore.
[324.52s -> 331.37s]  Oh, it's getting political.
[331.37s -> 332.65s]  No, I'm not getting political.
[332.65s -> 335.93s]  I'm just, this is just what's going on right now in the world.
[335.93s -> 337.93s]  This is one of the most volatile elections
[337.93s -> 339.45s]  in the American fucking history.
[343.83s -> 348.15s]  Okay, look, if me not even mentioning the election right now
[348.15s -> 352.79s]  is as if a fucking meteor on camera landed behind me.
[353.83s -> 357.43s]  And it was like, and like a fucking smoke cloud
[357.43s -> 358.23s]  took over the camp.
[358.87s -> 360.63s]  And I'm sitting there playing tear down like,
[360.63s -> 363.27s]  oh man, what's that?
[363.91s -> 365.27s]  Oh, did you guys see what I picked up?
[365.91s -> 366.63s]  And you hear like,
[371.94s -> 373.86s]  maybe the wind outside is getting a little weird.
[384.46s -> 390.41s]  I think I can use this in my inventory somewhere.
[391.61s -> 392.81s]  It's getting a little hot in here.
[392.81s -> 395.53s]  And like the fucking heat is just going in my window
[395.53s -> 397.21s]  and I'm like sweating and like red.
[399.38s -> 400.34s]  I'm sweaty in here.
[400.90s -> 404.02s]  AC, Las Vegas sure is hot and dry this time of year.
[408.71s -> 410.07s]  Of course, like, okay, of course.
[410.71s -> 413.51s]  The election was like literally decided an hour ago.
[414.86s -> 418.06s]  Like the, well, the projections were decided.
[418.06s -> 420.06s]  Now, I'm like, I can't turn the stream on
[420.06s -> 422.86s]  if you're like, hey, buddy, don't worry about that.
[426.73s -> 427.37s]  Jeb won.
[433.08s -> 434.76s]  Veggie turned on TV and it was like,
[434.76s -> 437.72s]  and ladies and gentlemen, the president-elect Jeb Bush
[437.72s -> 439.16s]  has been elected president.
[439.72s -> 444.49s]  I'd probably just be like, yeah, I guess.
[444.49s -> 446.01s]  That makes sense for 2020, doesn't it?
[447.67s -> 448.15s]  What happened?
[453.13s -> 453.61s]  All right, whatever.
[454.33s -> 455.61s]  Bring on 2021, let's go.
[456.25s -> 458.76s]  It should have clapped.
[458.76s -> 460.20s]  That's a millennial joke.
[461.40s -> 463.08s]  It's like fucking four years ago.
[467.22s -> 470.25s]  Wait, so what would have, I'm confused.
[470.89s -> 472.49s]  What do you mean that's a millennial joke?
[472.49s -> 473.77s]  Wait, we have boomer jokes.
[475.16s -> 477.88s]  Now we're saying LOL millennial joke.
[481.30s -> 485.37s]  Now, so wait, the zoomers have taken over now.
[485.37s -> 491.27s]  Uh-oh, zoomers have taken over
[491.27s -> 492.95s]  because now it's like, okay, millennial.
[492.95s -> 495.82s]  It's like we say, you know, as millennials, okay, boomer.
[495.82s -> 499.64s]  Now it's okay, LOL millennial.
[499.64s -> 503.30s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, getting too, I'm getting too old.
[503.30s -> 508.25s]  Uh-oh, I am now one tier above
[508.25s -> 512.50s]  who is considered annoying to the last generation.
[512.50s -> 521.34s]  Uh-oh, stinky.
[522.30s -> 530.50s]  I did kind of say that was pretty close, you're right.
[534.50s -> 538.06s]  But I will say, regardless of how you feel about the election,
[538.06s -> 540.62s]  aren't you just happy that this shit's going to be over with soon?
[541.18s -> 543.58s]  Like, I'm fucking so happy.
[543.58s -> 547.26s]  Like, can we breathe like a collective sigh of relief at this point that,
[547.26s -> 550.38s]  okay, can we just like move the fuck on, please?
[557.58s -> 560.38s]  And I know this, and look, and I know over the next couple of months,
[560.38s -> 561.66s]  it's going to be kind of wild,
[562.76s -> 567.29s]  but with like coronavirus, unseconomic uncertainty,
[567.29s -> 569.77s]  presidential elections, Trump, Biden.
[571.42s -> 573.74s]  Can you imagine being on the highway in 2021?
[575.03s -> 579.75s]  And you get to look in the rear view mirror in like the summer of 2021,
[580.31s -> 583.51s]  and like the fucking world is on fire in your rear view mirror,
[583.51s -> 586.71s]  and you're just like, holy shit, I'm on the road still, this is good.
[586.71s -> 589.62s]  Whoa, that's back there, what's ahead of us?
[589.62s -> 593.46s]  And it's just like big fucking beautiful clouds and rainbows.
[594.18s -> 597.06s]  There's like flying unicorns and shit.
[597.06s -> 602.22s]  Once we get over the coronavirus,
[602.22s -> 607.99s]  we get over all the like the heated political shit.
[607.99s -> 609.03s]  That's optimistic.
[609.03s -> 610.47s]  Well, I want to be optimistic.
[610.47s -> 612.15s]  Why, you don't want to be, I don't want to...
[612.15s -> 613.27s]  Woody, what would you sit here and be like,
[613.27s -> 616.15s]  yeah, I can't wait for in 2021 for the whole world to collapse
[616.15s -> 618.23s]  and everybody fucking just gets wiped out.
[621.46s -> 626.57s]  No, this is a doomer stream.
[627.37s -> 630.76s]  Economic Andy?
[635.94s -> 642.01s]  What the fuck?
[642.01s -> 643.69s]  Zoomer, boomer, doomer.
[645.86s -> 646.98s]  That's fucked.
[646.98s -> 649.38s]  Okay, I actually had a conversation with the mods about this
[649.38s -> 650.50s]  before I started the stream, because look,
[650.50s -> 652.74s]  I haven't been live since the election happened,
[653.38s -> 655.22s]  since they even started counting votes,
[655.22s -> 658.10s]  which by the way, if I have to fucking hear the words,
[658.82s -> 662.15s]  democratic stronghold one more time,
[662.15s -> 666.55s]  I'm going to eat a glass bottle.
[666.55s -> 669.51s]  If I hear the words, you know, we're still counting.
[669.51s -> 671.59s]  The counts coming in, you see, these are all real people.
[671.59s -> 672.39s]  These are people.
[672.39s -> 675.03s]  We're not saying they're not people, but we're still counting.
[675.03s -> 676.95s]  And this can change, it absolutely can change.
[676.95s -> 680.07s]  But the president obviously is seeing some trouble here,
[680.07s -> 681.27s]  but we're still counting.
[681.27s -> 681.83s]  We're counting.
[684.06s -> 685.34s]  Eight minute news cycle.
[685.34s -> 686.46s]  Eight minute news cycle.
[686.46s -> 688.22s]  See you in eight minutes for the eight minute news cycle.
[688.22s -> 688.94s]  We're still counting.
[688.94s -> 689.98s]  Let's take a look at this county.
[690.62s -> 693.08s]  Democratic stronghold.
[693.08s -> 693.72s]  No, stop.
[698.42s -> 699.78s]  Nevada, Omega Lo.
[699.78s -> 700.98s]  Yeah, I know.
[700.98s -> 706.09s]  They just shut the lights off like four days ago.
[709.86s -> 713.46s]  We have, Nevada is ready for the election,
[714.70s -> 718.78s]  but we're only going to be counting votes between 4 a.m.
[719.34s -> 720.62s]  and 11 a.m.
[721.26s -> 722.70s]  And then we're shutting the fucking lights off
[722.70s -> 724.22s]  and everybody goes home for three days.
[728.36s -> 730.04s]  Were you counting the votes by yourself?
[730.04s -> 730.84s]  Yeah, that's where I was.
[732.79s -> 733.99s]  That's where I've been.
[733.99s -> 735.67s]  I saw that video, by the way.
[735.67s -> 740.12s]  Political, political.
[740.12s -> 742.92s]  Of course, I'm going to get a little political.
[742.92s -> 746.60s]  Look, like I told you, the meteor is currently crashing.
[747.32s -> 748.52s]  It crashed at Earth.
[748.52s -> 750.92s]  I have to tell you about the meteor
[750.92s -> 752.52s]  for five minutes before the stream starts.
[752.52s -> 753.64s]  Come on, I live here.
[755.88s -> 757.88s]  I live in Nevada and we're currently
[757.88s -> 760.36s]  like the butt of every political joke
[760.36s -> 762.52s]  in the sphere of politics.
[763.40s -> 766.44s]  I have to address, I have to defend my domain, okay?
[767.34s -> 774.28s]  Look, Nevada's like 50 in education out of the 50 states.
[774.84s -> 776.41s]  Let me defend this.
[779.56s -> 781.08s]  It's literally the worst.
[785.75s -> 786.87s]  Hey, but let me tell you something.
[787.51s -> 790.39s]  We have, in Nevada, we've got one of the most
[790.39s -> 792.39s]  up-and-coming strong economies.
[793.03s -> 795.51s]  Our infrastructure is like top five in the country.
[796.71s -> 800.07s]  Our economic growth outlook is pretty good.
[800.71s -> 802.79s]  We are one of the, we are number four
[802.79s -> 804.39s]  in the country for infrastructure.
[804.39s -> 806.20s]  Did you know that?
[806.20s -> 807.48s]  Number four in the country.
[809.18s -> 813.34s]  We've got the beautiful roads, bridges, structures.
[813.34s -> 816.90s]  We have such good structural integrity.
[816.90s -> 818.50s]  We just can't count very high.
[818.50s -> 824.79s]  Once you get past a thousand,
[824.79s -> 836.28s]  you need like 30 more people to all count to a thousand and one.
[836.28s -> 837.40s]  Derma 2024.
[837.40s -> 838.84s]  You see, I can think about it.
[838.84s -> 840.92s]  Think about me on the stage right now going,
[840.92s -> 843.96s]  I just said fucking no more taxes.
[844.52s -> 845.61s]  That's it.
[845.61s -> 846.33s]  I don't say anything else.
[846.33s -> 847.29s]  I have no other policies.
[855.62s -> 857.14s]  I take a sip and I take a sip.
[857.14s -> 859.06s]  I pulled from underneath the podium.
[859.06s -> 860.66s]  A sip of a Bud Red.
[862.44s -> 865.80s]  And like the crowd's just like, oh, oh boo.
[865.80s -> 866.60s]  What the fuck?
[867.16s -> 874.84s]  And then I do like one of those fucking gross side burp muffles
[874.84s -> 878.84s]  where you go like, your like cheek fills up and it sprays.
[878.84s -> 880.92s]  It goes out the right side of your mouth really quickly.
[881.72s -> 890.74s]  What?
[890.74s -> 891.38s]  How is that stuff?
[891.38s -> 891.70s]  All right.
[891.70s -> 893.46s]  I look, it's been 15 minutes.
[893.46s -> 895.06s]  I talked about the meteor.
[895.86s -> 898.98s]  I talked about the smoking meteor that's in the backyard.
[898.98s -> 903.74s]  I get, I know where the people are on edge right now.
[903.74s -> 904.22s]  I know.
[904.22s -> 904.94s]  I get it.
[904.94s -> 908.92s]  I've been watching the news and flipping between channels
[908.92s -> 910.68s]  to see like what the fuck's even happening.
[910.68s -> 911.16s]  I get it.
[911.16s -> 911.96s]  I get it.
[911.96s -> 915.16s]  But I'm going to play a children's fucking Lego game.
[915.16s -> 915.66s]  Okay.
[916.12s -> 926.34s]  Play the game, funny man.
[926.34s -> 927.38s]  And another thing.
[927.38s -> 939.93s]  Go home.
[939.93s -> 943.03s]  What is Otto's stance?
[945.59s -> 956.36s]  Otto was one of like the 8,000 people that voted for Kanye West.
[956.36s -> 960.28s]  Hey, by the way, I think Mickey Mouse got more write-in votes
[960.28s -> 962.36s]  than Kanye West got real votes.
[962.36s -> 964.97s]  I feel like that's real.
[964.97s -> 974.46s]  Oh, that's pretty sick.
[974.46s -> 975.90s]  Somebody said poor Kanye.
[978.49s -> 982.87s]  I think he's going to be just fine, by the way.
[982.87s -> 989.83s]  Damn, that was cool.
[989.83s -> 990.39s]  All right.
[990.39s -> 992.18s]  Get your tools.
[992.18s -> 998.60s]  We have an extinguisher.
[998.60s -> 1004.47s]  Ooh, I love this thing.
[1004.47s -> 1005.35s]  This is awesome.
[1005.35s -> 1007.43s]  It's just like, it's like a marshmallow sprayer.
[1010.10s -> 1011.30s]  Why is there an extinguisher?
[1011.30s -> 1019.70s]  All right, sludge hammer.
[1019.70s -> 1022.06s]  But you're supposed to be able to break everything in this game.
[1022.06s -> 1023.38s]  Oh, you can.
[1023.38s -> 1023.94s]  Wait.
[1023.94s -> 1026.25s]  Well, this is my house.
[1026.25s -> 1027.69s]  Why would I be doing this to my house?
[1027.69s -> 1029.78s]  I got my sludge hammer.
[1029.78s -> 1031.06s]  I got my spray can.
[1031.06s -> 1033.61s]  Replace the fuse to turn on the power.
[1033.61s -> 1034.17s]  You can paint?
[1034.17s -> 1034.97s]  Does it all...
[1034.97s -> 1036.46s]  How do I switch colors?
[1036.46s -> 1042.92s]  Does it all have to be Halloween orange?
[1042.92s -> 1045.88s]  Dude, the home wrecker.
[1045.88s -> 1047.08s]  This is my favorite one.
[1047.08s -> 1051.99s]  I just smashed the desk.
[1051.99s -> 1055.43s]  I just heard electricity noises.
[1057.61s -> 1058.57s]  That's probably not good.
[1060.92s -> 1062.52s]  Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[1062.52s -> 1063.48s]  I can't help it.
[1063.48s -> 1064.20s]  Everything's breakable.
[1064.20s -> 1064.84s]  I'm going to do it.
[1064.84s -> 1065.56s]  There goes the toilet.
[1065.56s -> 1067.00s]  All right, this is a bad game for me to play.
[1067.00s -> 1068.36s]  Luigi's Mansion, I can't play it.
[1068.36s -> 1069.86s]  This is Luigi's Mansion.
[1069.86s -> 1073.02s]  Wait, did I just steal money out of a safe?
[1073.02s -> 1076.01s]  There's like a bunch of gold bars in here.
[1076.01s -> 1081.11s]  Oh, wait, no, that's fire.
[1081.11s -> 1092.54s]  Replace the fuse.
[1092.54s -> 1093.58s]  Dude, this is cool.
[1094.14s -> 1097.05s]  This is actually pretty cool.
[1097.05s -> 1101.29s]  He'd hammer his own children.
[1101.29s -> 1107.82s]  Okay, that's really like just a fucked up thing to say.
[1107.82s -> 1109.34s]  Switch gear station, okay.
[1109.34s -> 1112.12s]  Replace the fuse.
[1112.12s -> 1113.32s]  All right, fuse is on.
[1113.32s -> 1115.21s]  If I hit this, it's going to explode.
[1117.30s -> 1117.54s]  No.
[1118.10s -> 1119.38s]  All right, I'm telling you right now,
[1120.26s -> 1121.62s]  nodding for a million dollars.
[1121.62s -> 1124.42s]  If you said, hey, dude, I'll give you one million dollars.
[1124.42s -> 1127.46s]  If you take this sledgehammer and you swing it really hard
[1127.46s -> 1130.02s]  at this electrical grid, I'd be like, no, dude, I'm sorry.
[1132.26s -> 1133.38s]  No, I wouldn't do it.
[1133.38s -> 1134.50s]  No fucking way.
[1134.50s -> 1136.92s]  I wouldn't even do it for 10 million.
[1136.92s -> 1139.32s]  It would be too scary because it would just explode and kill you.
[1139.96s -> 1145.13s]  Go inside and check messages.
[1148.49s -> 1149.85s]  10 million dollars.
[1149.85s -> 1151.13s]  No, because what?
[1151.13s -> 1154.33s]  The chance that you do that and you just,
[1154.33s -> 1157.77s]  the metal from the sledgehammer just instantly sends like 50,000 volts into you
[1157.77s -> 1161.13s]  and you just explode into a splatter of blood and guts like that would probably happen.
[1163.34s -> 1165.43s]  Gas bill.
[1165.43s -> 1167.43s]  Gas bill just dropped on the floor.
[1167.43s -> 1170.55s]  Honestly, I'm not sure we can make it through the month.
[1170.55s -> 1171.83s]  Are you getting any requests?
[1171.83s -> 1173.51s]  At this point, we pretty much have to accept anything.
[1173.51s -> 1175.03s]  Be creative from mom.
[1175.03s -> 1177.48s]  Use this.
[1177.48s -> 1180.23s]  This just came in.
[1180.23s -> 1182.15s]  Sound kind of fishy, but we need the money.
[1182.15s -> 1183.03s]  You up for it?
[1183.03s -> 1183.99s]  Good evening.
[1183.99s -> 1188.55s]  My name is Gordon, general manager at the Evertides mall.
[1188.55s -> 1192.39s]  I have a slight problem with an old building that's blocking our plans for a new wing
[1192.95s -> 1194.63s]  and I need someone to knock it over.
[1195.91s -> 1199.67s]  I need it gone by tomorrow and I'd even be willing to pay more than the standard rate
[1199.67s -> 1201.37s]  for some extra discretion.
[1201.37s -> 1204.33s]  Quick execution and uncomfortable working hours.
[1204.33s -> 1207.13s]  Would you be able to take care of it?
[1207.13s -> 1209.64s]  Yeah, is this England?
[1209.64s -> 1211.29s]  Where is this?
[1211.29s -> 1212.33s]  What country is this?
[1212.33s -> 1213.61s]  Is this fucking Northrend?
[1213.61s -> 1214.41s]  Where are we?
[1214.41s -> 1220.65s]  Is this a made-up country?
[1220.65s -> 1222.25s]  Lockhell.
[1222.25s -> 1223.53s]  Lockhell what?
[1223.53s -> 1226.31s]  It's Finland?
[1226.31s -> 1227.27s]  Oh, okay.
[1227.27s -> 1231.64s]  This would be a pretty sick Warcraft map, don't you think?
[1231.64s -> 1234.12s]  This is like where a raid would be.
[1234.12s -> 1235.80s]  Like you don't actually get to go over here.
[1235.80s -> 1238.68s]  You just get to go look at it for a second and get instanced into the raid.
[1238.68s -> 1239.88s]  Fucking stupid, by the way.
[1239.88s -> 1241.48s]  Let me explore the cool area.
[1241.48s -> 1245.56s]  But I don't want to get instanced into your bullshit yet.
[1245.56s -> 1246.52s]  Uh, all right, what are we doing?
[1246.52s -> 1247.00s]  Right.
[1247.00s -> 1248.54s]  Evertides mall.
[1248.54s -> 1249.98s]  The old building problem.
[1249.98s -> 1254.81s]  An upscale shopping center by the waterfront managed by Gordon Wu,
[1254.81s -> 1257.85s]  also in the area, is Lockhell Municipality Folk Museum.
[1257.85s -> 1260.02s]  All right, so just to destroy the building.
[1260.02s -> 1262.82s]  An old building's blocking Gordon's plans for a new wing at the mall.
[1262.82s -> 1267.13s]  Is somebody in there?
[1267.13s -> 1270.09s]  Oh wait, it didn't say that there's nobody in the house.
[1271.34s -> 1276.52s]  The old building problem.
[1276.52s -> 1277.16s]  What?
[1277.24s -> 1279.96s]  Okay, escape.
[1280.92s -> 1281.64s]  Why escape?
[1281.64s -> 1283.96s]  You need to clear all the targets first.
[1283.96s -> 1290.30s]  What do you mean clear the targets?
[1290.30s -> 1294.71s]  Highly explosive propane tank.
[1294.71s -> 1295.51s]  Oh my god.
[1295.51s -> 1297.43s]  Okay, wait, it didn't do anything.
[1297.43s -> 1306.22s]  Wait, wait, wait, just do it just like um, just like in Jenga.
[1306.22s -> 1308.46s]  If somebody ever asks you to play Jenga and you don't want to play,
[1308.46s -> 1312.38s]  just deliberately take out like the two or three bottom rows secretly
[1312.38s -> 1315.45s]  while you pretend to play at the top row.
[1315.45s -> 1318.41s]  And then it'll be over and you'll be like, oh no, you got Jenga.
[1318.41s -> 1319.69s]  All right, now put the fucking thing away
[1319.69s -> 1321.21s]  and don't take it out for another five years.
[1322.09s -> 1329.91s]  Look at this.
[1330.63s -> 1332.70s]  It's still standing.
[1332.70s -> 1333.42s]  Why?
[1333.42s -> 1338.42s]  Go down.
[1339.37s -> 1340.17s]  What?
[1340.17s -> 1348.01s]  Oh, the fucking chimney is holding the whole thing up.
[1348.01s -> 1349.37s]  All right, let's blow up the chimney.
[1349.37s -> 1359.54s]  Come on, blow it up.
[1360.10s -> 1371.27s]  Is this not working?
[1373.67s -> 1374.95s]  Use a bulldozer.
[1374.95s -> 1380.12s]  What?
[1380.12s -> 1385.58s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[1385.58s -> 1385.98s]  Shovel.
[1386.54s -> 1388.78s]  Left mouse button, right mouse button.
[1388.78s -> 1392.10s]  It's a full letter grid, yeah?
[1392.66s -> 1396.42s]  All right, get this out of the way.
[1398.82s -> 1399.78s]  I love this game already.
[1400.34s -> 1401.70s]  Okay, dig it out.
[1402.26s -> 1410.54s]  All right, lift it up.
[1410.54s -> 1411.58s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1411.58s -> 1415.67s]  I'll just do this.
[1415.67s -> 1416.39s]  That's so much easier.
[1420.47s -> 1422.07s]  Imagine you saw somebody doing this.
[1425.77s -> 1427.21s]  I guess, I guess that works.
[1427.85s -> 1435.51s]  This is just what happens when somebody rents one of these.
[1437.70s -> 1439.30s]  To like move their pool.
[1440.39s -> 1441.43s]  No, I can do it.
[1441.43s -> 1441.99s]  I can do it.
[1441.99s -> 1443.19s]  I don't need to hire a company.
[1444.07s -> 1447.74s]  All right, I'm almost at the pool.
[1448.62s -> 1452.71s]  All right, lift it up.
[1453.43s -> 1454.07s]  Why is it stuck?
[1459.38s -> 1460.02s]  Why is it stuck?
[1463.48s -> 1464.52s]  Dig out that chimney.
[1465.08s -> 1468.38s]  How do I get rid of the chimney?
[1468.94s -> 1470.92s]  Get out.
[1475.18s -> 1475.50s]  Fall.
[1476.97s -> 1477.61s]  Why would...
[1477.61s -> 1477.85s]  Fall.
[1480.90s -> 1481.22s]  Fall.
[1483.72s -> 1484.04s]  Fall.
[1486.52s -> 1487.16s]  Wrong house?
[1487.56s -> 1497.83s]  No, it's not.
[1497.83s -> 1501.66s]  I mean, wrong house.
[1501.66s -> 1502.70s]  It's the wood one.
[1505.67s -> 1506.71s]  Yeah, bullshit.
[1506.71s -> 1507.35s]  I know.
[1507.35s -> 1508.15s]  Okay, let's get this.
[1509.19s -> 1509.99s]  This is so cool.
[1509.99s -> 1511.11s]  All right, I gotta calm down.
[1511.75s -> 1513.62s]  Is this a fire extinguisher?
[1513.62s -> 1513.94s]  Or a...
[1514.58s -> 1517.99s]  No, this is just a children's drawing of a Minecraft creeper.
[1517.99s -> 1519.45s]  And it's hung up on the fridge.
[1522.81s -> 1523.53s]  Oh, it's a stove.
[1523.53s -> 1528.31s]  Does this explode?
[1528.31s -> 1530.31s]  I swear to God, this is just what rich people do
[1530.31s -> 1532.86s]  when they're done with the house they live in.
[1532.86s -> 1535.26s]  They just smoke a fucking bunch of crack
[1535.26s -> 1537.42s]  and then they just destroy their house for fun.
[1538.06s -> 1544.57s]  They just do coke until they can't see anymore
[1544.57s -> 1546.33s]  and then they just destroy their house.
[1550.39s -> 1551.59s]  Read the sign.
[1551.59s -> 1552.87s]  We're not fucking reading.
[1552.87s -> 1553.51s]  Who wants to read?
[1554.07s -> 1566.09s]  The fuck did I throw that with my bare hands?
[1566.65s -> 1566.97s]  Okay.
[1567.53s -> 1571.74s]  Oh, more explosives.
[1577.59s -> 1578.55s]  Oh, sorry.
[1578.55s -> 1579.35s]  Whoever that was.
[1585.85s -> 1586.25s]  Right there.
[1586.25s -> 1586.89s]  There's a weak point.
[1591.59s -> 1595.34s]  All right, now let's fuck this thing up.
[1595.82s -> 1599.56s]  Somebody pulls over.
[1600.36s -> 1601.32s]  Excuse me.
[1601.32s -> 1602.76s]  Excuse me, is everything okay over here?
[1603.48s -> 1604.36s]  Yeah, don't worry, man.
[1604.36s -> 1605.56s]  We're just really rich.
[1606.20s -> 1607.00s]  Oh, okay.
[1607.00s -> 1607.96s]  Okay, have a nice day.
[1622.07s -> 1622.79s]  All right, let's do this.
[1622.79s -> 1623.27s]  Let's do this.
[1624.15s -> 1625.83s]  Let's do this in the right system.
[1626.55s -> 1628.23s]  Go up.
[1629.29s -> 1630.25s]  All the way up.
[1630.25s -> 1631.93s]  And then we're going to clasp down.
[1634.90s -> 1635.22s]  Ready?
[1635.86s -> 1639.27s]  Go through the roof.
[1639.27s -> 1639.59s]  Yes.
[1641.85s -> 1642.49s]  Rip it apart.
[1643.13s -> 1648.31s]  Is this a Mr. Beast video?
[1652.60s -> 1654.76s]  Yeah, but the only difference is Mr. Beast would do this
[1655.48s -> 1657.48s]  to somebody's house without them knowing.
[1659.27s -> 1660.39s]  And they'd show up and be like,
[1660.39s -> 1663.27s]  Mr. Beast, what the fuck did you do to my house?
[1664.23s -> 1664.79s]  Don't worry.
[1665.43s -> 1667.59s]  I bought you a million dollar house
[1667.59s -> 1669.35s]  and it's two miles down the road.
[1669.99s -> 1671.56s]  And they'd be like, wait, what?
[1671.56s -> 1672.68s]  What the fuck did you do?
[1673.56s -> 1679.58s]  What about all the pictures in the attic of my grandparents?
[1680.38s -> 1681.34s]  You don't need those anymore.
[1681.90s -> 1683.34s]  You've got a two million dollar house.
[1685.00s -> 1686.60s]  Oh, thanks, I guess.
[1695.45s -> 1696.57s]  Mr. Beast video.
[1697.85s -> 1702.01s]  Dude, okay, I saw a Mr. Beast video before
[1702.73s -> 1704.74s]  where he had like a bunch of fireworks people
[1704.74s -> 1708.98s]  and they blew up like nuclear bomb-like fireworks.
[1708.98s -> 1709.62s]  Out somewhere.
[1710.42s -> 1713.53s]  I saw like the fireworks Mr. Beast video
[1713.53s -> 1715.29s]  and I was like, holy shit, man.
[1717.70s -> 1718.34s]  What?
[1718.34s -> 1718.66s]  What?
[1718.66s -> 1719.14s]  How are they?
[1719.14s -> 1720.18s]  Where are you doing this?
[1721.14s -> 1727.16s]  Like, oh, this firework is $150,000
[1727.16s -> 1729.40s]  and we have like four fire departments here with us.
[1729.40s -> 1730.04s]  It's like, what?
[1730.92s -> 1735.59s]  It was it in Nevada?
[1736.31s -> 1740.20s]  All right, I did it.
[1740.20s -> 1740.52s]  I won.
[1741.08s -> 1747.56s]  FOV?
[1747.56s -> 1748.04s]  Too small?
[1748.60s -> 1749.08s]  Probably.
[1749.56s -> 1753.45s]  Let's go with like 100.
[1753.45s -> 1756.18s]  That's a little better.
[1763.19s -> 1765.35s]  No, I don't think I could ever do a Mr. Beast video.
[1765.35s -> 1766.71s]  I don't think I could swing on a swing set
[1766.71s -> 1768.15s]  until I piss my pants and make 10 grand.
[1768.23s -> 1769.51s]  I'm not sure I could do that.
[1769.51s -> 1770.71s]  Like for 24 hours.
[1770.71s -> 1778.50s]  I don't think I'd be able to do it.
[1781.61s -> 1782.57s]  He does have, look, all right.
[1782.57s -> 1784.97s]  He does have some crazy fucking videos though.
[1785.53s -> 1790.86s]  I saw another one where he like slimed his brother's house.
[1790.86s -> 1793.10s]  They like filled his entire brother's house with slime.
[1793.10s -> 1795.50s]  I'm just like, imagine being one of this person's fucking neighbors.
[1797.78s -> 1801.54s]  Every window of every floor, green slime is shooting out of it.
[1801.54s -> 1803.94s]  And it's like, did you just like drop my property value
[1803.94s -> 1806.66s]  by like 50 grand by doing what you just did?
[1807.80s -> 1809.96s]  Imagine like looking over the fence and being like, okay.
[1810.68s -> 1814.94s]  Um, I, uh, is it time to sell?
[1815.66s -> 1825.06s]  Less taxes though.
[1825.06s -> 1825.70s]  Woohoo.
[1825.70s -> 1826.66s]  Ah, turn it off.
[1827.38s -> 1831.67s]  Look at this bed.
[1831.67s -> 1833.51s]  Look at this little Minecraft bed.
[1833.51s -> 1835.75s]  This looks like a person sleeping here.
[1835.75s -> 1838.70s]  This is like a person just lying down on their back.
[1839.34s -> 1846.44s]  Wait, don't I need this stuff?
[1847.00s -> 1849.06s]  I feel like I need this stuff.
[1849.06s -> 1851.99s]  Isn't this my house?
[1851.99s -> 1852.95s]  Why would I be?
[1852.95s -> 1855.27s]  Why am I Mr. Beasting my own house?
[1855.27s -> 1861.96s]  Okay.
[1861.96s -> 1866.07s]  Oh, how much money did I get?
[1866.07s -> 1870.66s]  This just came in sound kind of fishy.
[1870.66s -> 1871.38s]  Got it.
[1871.38s -> 1872.86s]  Cool.
[1872.86s -> 1877.53s]  New investigation.
[1877.61s -> 1878.49s]  Oh, what a morning.
[1879.77s -> 1880.89s]  Shouldn't have taken that job.
[1880.89s -> 1882.09s]  I knew something wasn't right.
[1882.09s -> 1884.73s]  That building was under cultural heritage protection
[1884.73s -> 1886.97s]  and the demolition is not part of a criminal investigation.
[1887.77s -> 1888.57s]  What?
[1888.57s -> 1891.45s]  Mr. Turdy Man at the police just sent me this photo.
[1892.17s -> 1898.09s]  They must have caught you on a traffic camera heading towards the mall.
[1898.09s -> 1900.52s]  The very last thing we need right now is an investigation.
[1900.52s -> 1903.88s]  I tried sweet talking her and she thought she could get the case dropped.
[1903.88s -> 1905.14s]  I don't know what she wants.
[1905.14s -> 1905.70s]  Just do it.
[1925.06s -> 1926.55s]  That's pretty.
[1926.55s -> 1927.43s]  Oh my God.
[1928.25s -> 1929.53s]  This is terrible.
[1930.17s -> 1931.29s]  I did this.
[1931.29s -> 1941.62s]  Wouldn't the police, the perpetrators, did a quick job on the old building?
[1941.62s -> 1942.26s]  Oh, right.
[1942.26s -> 1944.02s]  I would have a TV that's indestructible.
[1949.38s -> 1952.02s]  So to wipe my record clean, I have to do a favor?
[1952.02s -> 1954.26s]  Just so you know, I don't usually do this but I'm stuck on a case
[1954.26s -> 1956.02s]  and I feel like I should try something new.
[1956.02s -> 1960.74s]  I've been investigating Lawrence Lee Jr. over tax evasion for months now
[1960.74s -> 1963.94s]  but he has so many friends in town that I can't get a warrant.
[1963.94s -> 1968.98s]  How about you use your skills to borrow the computers over at Lee Chemicals
[1968.98s -> 1973.74s]  so that I can finally access his customer registry and sort this mess out?
[1973.74s -> 1979.16s]  If you do this for me, I'll make sure your little blunder will be forgotten.
[1979.16s -> 1980.12s]  Lee Computers.
[1982.41s -> 1983.61s]  Lee Chemicals, okay?
[1984.17s -> 1991.32s]  Marissa wants access to Lee's customer registry.
[1991.32s -> 1993.72s]  Pick up three computers at the site for her, okay?
[1993.72s -> 1994.84s]  Pick up three computers.
[1994.84s -> 1995.96s]  Don't destroy the building, right?
[1995.96s -> 1997.61s]  But that's it.
[1997.61s -> 1999.93s]  I can't, I have to do every single one of these.
[1999.93s -> 2001.37s]  I'm going to be on the news every day.
[2001.37s -> 2008.44s]  Press tab to toggle map and objectives.
[2008.44s -> 2011.10s]  Ooh, that's cool.
[2011.10s -> 2013.72s]  That's very much appreciated.
[2013.72s -> 2015.24s]  Okay.
[2015.24s -> 2016.68s]  Security, there's a fire alarm?
[2016.68s -> 2020.18s]  Large fires will trigger the fire alarm.
[2020.18s -> 2020.98s]  Shit, all right.
[2020.98s -> 2022.52s]  Let's compute it right in here.
[2023.24s -> 2024.68s]  Is this illegal for me to be here?
[2024.68s -> 2029.53s]  Am I like not allowed to be at Lee's Chemical Plant?
[2029.53s -> 2040.84s]  There's no security besides fire, right?
[2040.84s -> 2041.56s]  There's one.
[2041.56s -> 2048.71s]  There's the other one.
[2048.71s -> 2049.51s]  Right here, okay.
[2057.98s -> 2058.46s]  Where is it?
[2060.09s -> 2060.89s]  Right ahead, okay.
[2075.78s -> 2076.90s]  I stole valuables.
[2077.46s -> 2082.86s]  There's no people in here, right?
[2086.14s -> 2087.02s]  Don't erase.
[2087.02s -> 2088.62s]  Attic is off limits for all employees.
[2088.62s -> 2089.34s]  What?
[2089.34s -> 2094.36s]  There's two?
[2094.36s -> 2095.32s]  All right, now I need one more.
[2095.80s -> 2098.01s]  Why would I walk down the stairs?
[2100.07s -> 2104.23s]  Oh, it's a fake wall with a real wall behind it.
[2104.23s -> 2104.71s]  Bullshit.
[2105.27s -> 2112.73s]  Wait, go in the attic.
[2112.73s -> 2117.96s]  Let's see, there's illegal stuff in the attic, right?
[2118.52s -> 2124.50s]  How do I get in the attic?
[2125.30s -> 2126.31s]  Oh, up here.
[2127.66s -> 2129.10s]  All right, this is the attic.
[2129.10s -> 2132.36s]  How do I get up to the attic?
[2133.42s -> 2135.83s]  All right, I'm almost there.
[2136.47s -> 2139.46s]  All right, I'm in the attic.
[2139.46s -> 2144.81s]  I just got Lee's Tax Deductible Pension.
[2144.81s -> 2149.29s]  Nice, that's it.
[2149.29s -> 2150.25s]  All right, cool.
[2150.25s -> 2154.42s]  All right, on to the next one.
[2154.42s -> 2155.22s]  Is this car okay?
[2160.26s -> 2165.18s]  Last one is, I'll just bang a right and right.
[2165.18s -> 2166.38s]  Okay, so bang a right.
[2166.94s -> 2184.98s]  I'm doing the thing that everyone was so afraid of GPS is doing.
[2185.62s -> 2187.69s]  Let's drive straight.
[2187.69s -> 2188.57s]  I can't drive straight.
[2188.57s -> 2189.37s]  There's a building.
[2190.09s -> 2190.89s]  Drive straight.
[2192.04s -> 2192.84s]  There's a building.
[2202.18s -> 2202.42s]  What?
[2204.44s -> 2205.40s]  Oh, shit, nice.
[2205.40s -> 2207.24s]  That gigantic explosive.
[2207.24s -> 2208.12s]  Don't break this.
[2208.84s -> 2215.86s]  Okay, I gotta go up there.
[2215.86s -> 2217.06s]  Oh, it's easy.
[2217.06s -> 2222.20s]  And go, we're done.
[2222.20s -> 2223.80s]  Wait, any more things to steal?
[2223.80s -> 2226.66s]  Yep, coffee maker.
[2228.26s -> 2231.88s]  And I don't know what that is.
[2232.44s -> 2236.79s]  Get out of the escape vehicle.
[2236.79s -> 2240.60s]  All right, should I fight something?
[2241.16s -> 2244.81s]  All right, where's my vehicle?
[2244.81s -> 2247.86s]  I didn't even start any fires.
[2247.86s -> 2248.66s]  This is perfect.
[2248.66s -> 2250.41s]  Where's my escape vehicle?
[2250.41s -> 2253.16s]  All right, down this way.
[2253.16s -> 2255.59s]  Is there a sprint?
[2262.34s -> 2263.54s]  Raise every building.
[2264.10s -> 2265.30s]  No, that's not part of the job.
[2266.10s -> 2275.21s]  That's it.
[2277.90s -> 2279.34s]  Raise every other building.
[2279.34s -> 2281.02s]  No, I want a bunch of money.
[2286.70s -> 2287.42s]  Raise all.
[2288.78s -> 2290.62s]  All right, I promise I'll destroy the next one.
[2290.62s -> 2294.81s]  See, I got four points for that.
[2295.29s -> 2295.93s]  Breaking news.
[2300.06s -> 2302.14s]  Breaking at Lee Chemicals.
[2302.14s -> 2311.86s]  The perpetrator caused property damage and managed to get away with electronic equipment.
[2313.37s -> 2318.65s]  CEO Lawrence Lee Jr. says they will upgrade security
[2318.65s -> 2322.95s]  and should be up and running again soon.
[2322.95s -> 2324.31s]  Faster with the teleprompter, please.
[2324.31s -> 2332.84s]  Public school reading.
[2332.84s -> 2367.24s]  Yeah, that's just the morning announcements.
[2367.24s -> 2370.76s]  If it were you or if it were me, I want that job.
[2370.76s -> 2373.14s]  When I'm done with streaming,
[2373.14s -> 2375.70s]  there's like two things that I would want to do.
[2375.70s -> 2378.89s]  And one is work with animals somehow.
[2378.89s -> 2384.95s]  Or be the person that does the morning announcements in a middle school.
[2384.95s -> 2388.55s]  That's what I want to do when I'm done with like streaming and like online stuff.
[2388.55s -> 2390.62s]  I just want to, I want to, I'll come in.
[2390.62s -> 2391.58s]  You don't have to pay me that much.
[2392.84s -> 2395.16s]  I will, I will make that fun as fuck.
[2395.16s -> 2396.36s]  I will make it so exciting.
[2396.36s -> 2399.08s]  People are gonna be so happy to listen to the morning announcements
[2399.08s -> 2428.55s]  because I'll just be like, I would be, I would be so much fun.
[2430.95s -> 2435.72s]  But I guess, I guess that at like six o'clock in the morning,
[2435.72s -> 2437.08s]  maybe you don't want to hear that.
[2437.08s -> 2440.46s]  I guess that might be like a little annoying.
[2444.98s -> 2445.70s]  I'm tired.
[2445.70s -> 2448.98s]  I don't want to hear a guy be like a clown on the PA system.
[2448.98s -> 2452.23s]  But would I be able to like just jump in in the middle of the day?
[2452.23s -> 2453.78s]  You know what I mean?
[2453.78s -> 2475.98s]  Just be like, don't say emergency.
[2475.98s -> 2476.54s]  Oh, right.
[2476.54s -> 2478.22s]  Yeah, don't say emergency.
[2481.08s -> 2482.28s]  That's not an emergency.
[2489.51s -> 2492.15s]  I would be thrown the fuck out immediately.
[2492.15s -> 2494.71s]  You're like, yeah, you can only like pretend
[2494.71s -> 2499.03s]  to do an emergency announcement for like a funny backwards words day thing
[2499.03s -> 2501.11s]  before we take you out and you've been removed.
[2501.11s -> 2501.99s]  You've been fired.
[2501.99s -> 2503.51s]  I would hate to fire me though, wouldn't you?
[2504.25s -> 2505.77s]  Wouldn't you hate to fire me?
[2505.77s -> 2509.40s]  Because it'd be like, fuck, we just brought this guy into like a hype up the students
[2509.40s -> 2512.92s]  and have fun and like it's been three days and we hate this fucking guy.
[2512.92s -> 2514.84s]  And I have to, he's so positive.
[2514.84s -> 2515.96s]  He's like so happy.
[2516.68s -> 2519.48s]  He comes to work with like ready to go.
[2519.48s -> 2522.44s]  He's got like a jumbo iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts
[2522.44s -> 2524.28s]  and he's like ready to go for four hours straight,
[2524.28s -> 2525.48s]  whatever we need him for.
[2525.48s -> 2528.86s]  But you got to go like get the fuck out of here.
[2528.86s -> 2533.08s]  I'd be like, no, I'm over the PA system.
[2533.08s -> 2534.28s]  I would want to do it over.
[2534.28s -> 2538.33s]  I want to get fired over the PA system so we can do this weird like drama.
[2538.33s -> 2540.65s]  We can start like this weird like skit kind of drama
[2540.65s -> 2545.53s]  where like the PA guy gets fired.
[2545.53s -> 2548.73s]  Okay, if you guys in the morning, instead of the announcements,
[2548.73s -> 2553.72s]  it was like drama between the teachers and the principals.
[2553.72s -> 2556.71s]  Don't you think that would be like interesting?
[2556.71s -> 2558.63s]  You knew it was made up, but it was like, you know,
[2559.27s -> 2560.55s]  my favorite teacher versus like this.
[2560.55s -> 2562.79s]  Like they're like inside of the,
[2562.79s -> 2565.59s]  they're like arguing back and forth with like music behind them,
[2565.59s -> 2569.54s]  like sad music or like intense music for a big argument.
[2573.27s -> 2574.87s]  Yeah, it'd be like WWE.
[2574.87s -> 2577.35s]  But there'd be no fighting, just like arguments.
[2577.35s -> 2584.76s]  It'd be a soap opera, yeah.
[2584.76s -> 2585.56s]  PA announcer.
[2587.08s -> 2590.39s]  I don't think you could do that in,
[2591.11s -> 2593.75s]  don't think you could say that over the middle school PA system.
[2593.75s -> 2594.31s]  Sorry.
[2594.31s -> 2600.54s]  Or if there was fighting, you just heard like, god damn it.
[2641.46s -> 2647.34s]  I'm sure some of you have been aware Professor Michaels
[2648.06s -> 2655.99s]  took a paternity test to find out if they were the father of Mrs. Stevenson's baby.
[2657.19s -> 2660.84s]  Those results have come back.
[2661.56s -> 2668.52s]  Join us today for a new episode of the morning announcements.
[2669.48s -> 2675.94s]  Just know you are.
[2676.58s -> 2678.90s]  It's impossible.
[2678.90s -> 2681.30s]  I can just no way I am the father.
[2681.30s -> 2684.18s]  You need to go back to the doctor and get a real test.
[2684.18s -> 2685.30s]  Not one of these fake ones.
[2685.30s -> 2688.02s]  It has to be Professor Johnson.
[2690.17s -> 2691.45s]  I don't believe you.
[2691.45s -> 2693.77s]  I'm leaving you for good this time.
[2694.73s -> 2698.33s]  I don't want to ever see your face again, ever again.
[2699.13s -> 2706.57s]  And by the way, after school tutoring will be from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.
[2708.07s -> 2710.71s]  How dare you talk about after school tutoring?
[2711.35s -> 2713.83s]  They should be going to dodgeball after school.
[2714.39s -> 2716.39s]  You piece of crap.
[2717.56s -> 2718.36s]  I'm leaving.
[2718.92s -> 2726.17s]  What are you doing here?
[2726.17s -> 2729.61s]  Get out of here, you maniac.
[2729.61s -> 2731.77s]  I know that you're the real father.
[2731.77s -> 2733.05s]  It's Professor Johnson.
[2734.41s -> 2736.79s]  Yeah, I'll tell you something.
[2737.83s -> 2742.07s]  Science class is going to be delayed today while I go out.
[2744.55s -> 2745.51s]  While I go out.
[2746.23s -> 2749.19s]  Science class is going to be delayed today while I go out
[2749.19s -> 2751.35s]  and spend some time with my grandmother.
[2751.99s -> 2756.84s]  Just whatever your fucking name is.
[2758.04s -> 2761.48s]  I can't believe you want to tell me it's my baby.
[2762.52s -> 2764.42s]  It is your baby.
[2764.42s -> 2765.14s]  No, it's not.
[2765.14s -> 2766.26s]  I am.
[2766.26s -> 2769.88s]  Why did you throw something at me?
[2770.92s -> 2772.28s]  Ow, my face.
[2773.72s -> 2776.20s]  You, stop fighting, you two prints.
[2778.55s -> 2800.04s]  Also today, assembly will be about staying away from drugs and alcohol.
[2800.04s -> 2803.50s]  Should be really, really interesting.
[2803.50s -> 2806.02s]  That'll be all.
[2806.02s -> 2813.98s]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[2813.98s -> 2817.38s]  Next time, with the morning announcements.
[2823.62s -> 2825.54s]  How much more excited for school would you be?
[2829.94s -> 2830.58s]  Think about that.
[2830.58s -> 2832.50s]  If you knew that you were going to get that shit every day,
[2834.97s -> 2836.09s]  people would get so into it.
[2836.65s -> 2837.80s]  You would hate it.
[2837.80s -> 2838.44s]  No way.
[2838.44s -> 2839.32s]  There's no way.
[2839.32s -> 2841.24s]  If the teachers were pretending to like...
[2841.24s -> 2841.88s]  Actually, that would be...
[2842.44s -> 2843.16s]  No, it would be fun.
[2843.96s -> 2850.82s]  What did that even sound like?
[2850.82s -> 2851.86s]  That would be cringe.
[2853.06s -> 2854.49s]  Hold on.
[2854.49s -> 2856.65s]  Did that even sound the way that I wanted it to?
[2857.21s -> 2859.03s]  Hold on a second.
[2859.03s -> 2859.59s]  Did it?
[2859.59s -> 2860.71s]  Yeah, no, that was fine.
[2860.71s -> 2874.42s]  That didn't sound right.
[2874.42s -> 2876.10s]  That's not what I was going for.
[2876.10s -> 2879.40s]  It's all right, though.
[2879.40s -> 2881.32s]  It still works.
[2881.88s -> 2885.13s]  All right, I gotta play the video game again.
[2885.13s -> 2886.01s]  I forgot.
[2886.01s -> 2890.39s]  If the world...
[2891.27s -> 2891.59s]  What?
[2895.53s -> 2897.29s]  If a Roomba was a person,
[2902.62s -> 2905.66s]  I was trying to do pitch shifting, not like robot.
[2905.66s -> 2906.54s]  Whatever, who cares?
[2911.72s -> 2912.52s]  Ah, fuck.
[2912.52s -> 2913.64s]  All right, let's go.
[2913.72s -> 2915.64s]  The customer registry indicates
[2915.64s -> 2917.32s]  that Lee has worked almost exclusively
[2917.32s -> 2919.08s]  with a single client recently.
[2919.08s -> 2924.28s]  The client is what they refer to as BT
[2924.28s -> 2925.32s]  and no further details.
[2925.32s -> 2928.79s]  So I really have to bother you with one more favor.
[2929.53s -> 2930.65s]  Head back to Lee Chemicals
[2930.65s -> 2932.57s]  and fetch their employee login devices.
[2935.56s -> 2936.92s]  I should be able to cross-reference
[2936.92s -> 2939.08s]  their log files with the delivery schedule
[2939.08s -> 2941.40s]  to figure out where they are moving the product
[2941.40s -> 2943.43s]  and what BT means.
[2943.43s -> 2944.79s]  Install the new security system.
[2944.79s -> 2945.35s]  Be careful.
[2945.35s -> 2948.68s]  All right.
[2948.68s -> 2950.52s]  Pick up three login devices.
[2950.52s -> 2952.60s]  They're protected by an alarm system.
[2952.60s -> 2956.12s]  Security arrives 60 seconds after an alarm is triggered.
[2956.12s -> 2957.99s]  Oh, shit.
[2957.99s -> 2959.11s]  Okay, I gotta be careful.
[2959.11s -> 2966.09s]  All right, now there's new security.
[2967.59s -> 2973.06s]  The cameras show up.
[2973.06s -> 2974.34s]  Wired alarm boxes.
[2974.34s -> 2977.46s]  Breaking an alarm box or wire triggers the alarm, okay?
[2977.46s -> 2979.75s]  Is this an alarm box?
[2980.74s -> 2982.18s]  Anti-theft protection system.
[2983.75s -> 2985.11s]  All right, so let's just jump over the fence.
[3004.30s -> 3007.78s]  Wait, it's just a sign.
[3008.42s -> 3010.20s]  It's locked.
[3011.98s -> 3013.34s]  Don't fucking ram it.
[3013.34s -> 3014.14s]  All right, I got through.
[3014.78s -> 3016.71s]  All right, where's the first one?
[3018.25s -> 3018.65s]  Up here.
[3018.65s -> 3019.69s]  All right, don't fuck anything up.
[3019.69s -> 3021.13s]  Just go in normally.
[3021.13s -> 3036.34s]  This is one right here, right?
[3036.34s -> 3036.58s]  No?
[3037.38s -> 3038.74s]  No, it's other building.
[3038.74s -> 3038.98s]  Shit.
[3039.62s -> 3048.10s]  All right.
[3048.10s -> 3049.06s]  Watch out for the security.
[3049.70s -> 3054.71s]  Wait, can I shut down the security system?
[3054.71s -> 3058.15s]  Dude, what's this?
[3058.15s -> 3058.55s]  What's this?
[3059.19s -> 3061.54s]  It's like cash under here.
[3062.26s -> 3063.14s]  Hidden cash.
[3063.14s -> 3063.86s]  What the fuck?
[3063.86s -> 3064.90s]  Okay, hidden cash.
[3065.62s -> 3068.30s]  I'll give you 10 million.
[3068.30s -> 3069.77s]  Give me it.
[3070.41s -> 3071.29s]  Give me it.
[3071.29s -> 3073.85s]  Free money.
[3073.85s -> 3074.41s]  Free hidden.
[3074.41s -> 3075.53s]  Okay, here we go.
[3075.53s -> 3078.14s]  Is this open?
[3078.14s -> 3080.54s]  All right, wait.
[3081.82s -> 3082.78s]  Can I just drive through this?
[3093.69s -> 3094.89s]  Just break everything.
[3095.37s -> 3099.62s]  But I don't want to break anything because it's bad now.
[3099.62s -> 3101.78s]  They have security alarms everywhere.
[3101.78s -> 3109.72s]  See, this is good.
[3109.72s -> 3111.08s]  Go up top and then...
[3111.08s -> 3112.62s]  There we go.
[3112.62s -> 3115.02s]  Okay, it's a security alert here.
[3115.02s -> 3117.54s]  How do I turn that off?
[3126.87s -> 3127.59s]  Key card.
[3127.59s -> 3127.99s]  All right, wait.
[3127.99s -> 3128.31s]  Hold on.
[3129.54s -> 3130.50s]  Can I do this like in a row?
[3137.37s -> 3139.69s]  There's one, two, three.
[3139.69s -> 3147.19s]  Why don't I just drive into every building
[3147.19s -> 3149.40s]  and just pick it up and run as fast as I can?
[3149.40s -> 3149.96s]  Quick save.
[3165.88s -> 3166.92s]  Go, go, go, go.
[3171.94s -> 3172.42s]  Open the door.
[3172.42s -> 3174.82s]  Open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open.
[3175.54s -> 3176.34s]  The door's locked.
[3185.02s -> 3185.26s]  Shit.
[3186.30s -> 3188.38s]  I didn't plan accordingly.
[3188.38s -> 3189.82s]  I didn't plan accordingly.
[3189.82s -> 3202.23s]  Use scroll wheel when clicking on doors.
[3202.23s -> 3203.03s]  Oh shit, thanks.
[3203.67s -> 3205.45s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3205.45s -> 3206.49s]  I got to plan accordingly.
[3206.49s -> 3207.53s]  So this is this one.
[3208.09s -> 3209.29s]  There's one right across here.
[3209.85s -> 3213.34s]  Let's make a plan.
[3213.34s -> 3214.62s]  So if I jump out of here,
[3215.42s -> 3219.19s]  I'm going to jump from here into this building in front of me.
[3219.19s -> 3220.95s]  From this building in front of me,
[3221.59s -> 3224.94s]  I'm going to jump to this pipe.
[3224.94s -> 3228.02s]  I got to get on that pipe.
[3228.02s -> 3232.98s]  So if I go from here, jump to this pipe like this.
[3233.54s -> 3235.14s]  Fucking idiot.
[3235.14s -> 3235.94s]  How did you miss that?
[3235.94s -> 3236.82s]  It's so easy.
[3238.66s -> 3239.78s]  That gets me right here.
[3239.78s -> 3240.50s]  Window.
[3240.50s -> 3241.06s]  Through the window.
[3243.53s -> 3244.89s]  It's in the back there.
[3244.89s -> 3245.61s]  So I got two.
[3246.17s -> 3247.86s]  Let's get that.
[3247.86s -> 3248.98s]  Let's see if I can, let's get that.
[3256.82s -> 3257.70s]  Run it backwards.
[3257.70s -> 3259.54s]  Yeah, yeah, I'm just going to get a good look.
[3259.54s -> 3264.70s]  So that works too.
[3264.70s -> 3265.75s]  Let's get through here.
[3268.62s -> 3269.34s]  Whatever.
[3269.34s -> 3273.75s]  They don't give a shit about this.
[3276.98s -> 3280.02s]  So up there, grab that one out to here.
[3280.92s -> 3284.07s]  Get this one and then through the pipe.
[3284.71s -> 3288.06s]  Is there a window there?
[3290.70s -> 3291.42s]  Okay, here we go.
[3291.42s -> 3291.98s]  I got it.
[3291.98s -> 3292.22s]  I got it.
[3292.22s -> 3292.54s]  You ready?
[3293.10s -> 3293.42s]  I'm ready.
[3293.42s -> 3293.74s]  I'm ready.
[3293.74s -> 3294.46s]  I'm ready.
[3294.46s -> 3294.94s]  I'm ready.
[3297.96s -> 3298.60s]  I'm ready.
[3298.60s -> 3308.42s]  Work save.
[3309.38s -> 3310.34s]  Use spray paint.
[3311.86s -> 3314.20s]  Oh, yeah, I guess that makes sense.
[3314.20s -> 3315.64s]  We'll try that next time if I don't do it.
[3318.09s -> 3321.58s]  In three, two, one.
[3329.24s -> 3330.44s]  I tried to hold it.
[3331.48s -> 3331.72s]  Fuck.
[3333.16s -> 3334.52s]  Restart, restart, restart.
[3334.52s -> 3336.63s]  I turned too quickly.
[3336.63s -> 3355.53s]  I was holding right click and I turned too fast and hit the wall.
[3355.53s -> 3358.09s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3358.09s -> 3358.81s]  Go.
[3358.81s -> 3360.95s]  Did it do it?
[3362.57s -> 3362.89s]  What?
[3369.54s -> 3370.18s]  Fuck.
[3370.18s -> 3375.88s]  Was that the last one?
[3376.44s -> 3393.51s]  Oh, get me out.
[3393.51s -> 3394.07s]  Where's the car?
[3394.87s -> 3397.99s]  Fuck.
[3397.99s -> 3398.39s]  I got it.
[3398.39s -> 3399.75s]  It's I got to do the other.
[3399.75s -> 3403.99s]  Oh, I'm arrested.
[3403.99s -> 3412.12s]  Why did the I can't blow up the wall.
[3412.12s -> 3412.60s]  What the fuck?
[3412.60s -> 3413.64s]  What's the point of these things?
[3414.20s -> 3418.47s]  Okay, here, pipe.
[3418.47s -> 3427.11s]  Got to get in here.
[3427.11s -> 3429.56s]  Doing it backwards.
[3429.56s -> 3431.59s]  Plan a route.
[3431.59s -> 3434.98s]  Okay, where's my spray paint?
[3434.98s -> 3437.83s]  So I need to go in here.
[3438.39s -> 3440.89s]  So let's just do.
[3440.89s -> 3441.61s]  Okay, in here.
[3442.33s -> 3447.30s]  Okay.
[3447.86s -> 3453.50s]  And then from here we can go.
[3453.50s -> 3454.38s]  Is there a window there?
[3455.10s -> 3457.64s]  We're right here.
[3463.50s -> 3464.22s]  Don't go this way.
[3464.22s -> 3464.86s]  Don't go this way.
[3464.86s -> 3465.26s]  Don't go this.
[3465.26s -> 3465.74s]  This is wrong.
[3465.74s -> 3468.17s]  This is wrong.
[3468.17s -> 3469.29s]  How do I erase?
[3469.29s -> 3470.73s]  How do I erase that?
[3471.29s -> 3472.57s]  All right, we'll go this way instead.
[3477.16s -> 3478.52s]  That takes us to here.
[3478.52s -> 3481.54s]  There's a window right there.
[3481.54s -> 3484.42s]  Wait.
[3484.42s -> 3492.23s]  Okay, hold on.
[3492.23s -> 3494.17s]  To here, this is the window.
[3494.17s -> 3495.77s]  All right, then this goes out.
[3511.85s -> 3515.19s]  And that leads me to out here.
[3521.78s -> 3522.98s]  Nevada IQ.
[3522.98s -> 3525.11s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3525.11s -> 3526.71s]  Well, I want to let me get in this building.
[3526.71s -> 3527.43s]  This is the hard one.
[3527.43s -> 3529.67s]  This is the one where, like, how do I get in here?
[3541.50s -> 3544.30s]  Where's the actual way to get out of here?
[3544.30s -> 3544.94s]  Right here.
[3544.94s -> 3553.90s]  So it's open.
[3553.90s -> 3554.54s]  Oh, yeah.
[3554.54s -> 3554.78s]  Okay.
[3554.78s -> 3556.06s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3556.06s -> 3556.30s]  Okay.
[3557.82s -> 3562.58s]  Because this is the best way to go from here to here, right?
[3562.58s -> 3563.46s]  Getting in this.
[3563.46s -> 3565.06s]  All right, so we're going to come through the door.
[3565.62s -> 3568.94s]  We're going to go in the door, up, grab through the window,
[3568.94s -> 3570.14s]  out here through this window.
[3570.14s -> 3582.14s]  So now we got to go this way.
[3582.14s -> 3607.75s]  It's the landing zone right here.
[3607.75s -> 3608.87s]  All right, I got it.
[3608.87s -> 3609.59s]  I'm ready.
[3609.59s -> 3613.02s]  All right, I'm ready.
[3613.02s -> 3613.34s]  I'm ready.
[3613.34s -> 3613.58s]  I'm ready.
[3613.58s -> 3624.22s]  You ready?
[3624.30s -> 3627.08s]  Um, how did I get up there?
[3631.85s -> 3633.37s]  Melt his Lego brain.
[3637.08s -> 3638.28s]  I don't want to plan any routes.
[3638.28s -> 3641.40s]  I just wanted to blow up buildings with my hammer.
[3642.34s -> 3642.82s]  All right.
[3642.82s -> 3643.38s]  Are you ready?
[3643.38s -> 3643.78s]  I'm doing it.
[3643.78s -> 3644.66s]  Let's go.
[3644.66s -> 3645.62s]  I got my route.
[3645.62s -> 3645.94s]  I'm ready.
[3645.94s -> 3646.82s]  One, two, three, go.
[3670.49s -> 3671.21s]  Go.
[3671.21s -> 3680.57s]  We're out.
[3680.57s -> 3683.83s]  Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[3683.83s -> 3684.55s]  How do I get out of here?
[3684.55s -> 3685.11s]  How do I get out of here?
[3685.11s -> 3685.59s]  How do I get out?
[3685.59s -> 3686.71s]  How do I get out of here?
[3686.71s -> 3691.46s]  There's a car.
[3691.46s -> 3692.02s]  Where's the car?
[3692.90s -> 3693.54s]  Oh, shit.
[3703.94s -> 3704.90s]  The door is locked.
[3720.38s -> 3721.98s]  I glitched through that to begin with.
[3722.62s -> 3723.26s]  Wait.
[3723.26s -> 3730.33s]  Wait, what?
[3730.33s -> 3738.46s]  How do I open this normally?
[3738.46s -> 3767.74s]  All right.
[3767.74s -> 3768.62s]  Let's fucking go.
[3768.62s -> 3772.62s]  The whole game is about smashing, dude.
[3772.62s -> 3774.30s]  Are you really asking?
[3774.30s -> 3781.43s]  How do I do this?
[3781.43s -> 3783.85s]  Just drive through the fucking building.
[3783.85s -> 3784.49s]  Done.
[3784.49s -> 3787.21s]  All right.
[3787.21s -> 3787.77s]  This is it.
[3787.77s -> 3788.81s]  I'm going to get it right here.
[3788.81s -> 3800.04s]  Hit that game, please.
[3800.04s -> 3850.97s]  And one, two, three, go.
[3850.97s -> 3851.85s]  Hurry, please.
[3857.80s -> 3859.80s]  You'll never catch me alive.
[3859.80s -> 3873.18s]  11 minutes and 18 seconds.
[3873.18s -> 3880.52s]  Cool.
[3880.52s -> 3881.80s]  Amateur, you've reached a new rank.
[3881.80s -> 3883.56s]  A new tool has been delivered.
[3883.56s -> 3885.40s]  You fucking kidding me?
[3885.40s -> 3886.63s]  What is it?
[3886.63s -> 3889.05s]  Blowtorch.
[3889.05s -> 3894.63s]  You can upgrade your tools in the computer terminal.
[3894.63s -> 3899.62s]  How do you start fire?
[3899.62s -> 3903.06s]  Where's my house fireproof?
[3903.06s -> 3922.76s]  I love burning bricks.
[3922.76s -> 3929.58s]  Are you using it through metal?
[3929.58s -> 3930.78s]  Oh, that's cool.
[3930.78s -> 3938.36s]  That's a pretty good slugpog, if you ask me.
[3938.36s -> 3940.10s]  OK, tools.
[3940.10s -> 3940.66s]  Sledge.
[3941.66s -> 3942.86s]  No upgrades available.
[3943.50s -> 3944.38s]  No upgrades.
[3944.38s -> 3944.62s]  Oh, wait.
[3944.62s -> 3945.93s]  Hold on.
[3945.93s -> 3946.49s]  Attribute.
[3946.49s -> 3948.41s]  Short range tool causes medium damage.
[3949.05s -> 3951.16s]  No upgrades.
[3951.16s -> 3952.28s]  No upgrades?
[3952.28s -> 3954.65s]  Oh, I'll think.
[3954.65s -> 3955.29s]  Yeah.
[3955.29s -> 3956.25s]  Whatever.
[3956.25s -> 3958.65s]  I max it out.
[3958.65s -> 3964.55s]  Messages.
[3964.55s -> 3964.79s]  OK.
[3966.12s -> 3966.76s]  Investigation.
[3966.76s -> 3967.80s]  Didn't I already do this?
[3967.80s -> 3968.28s]  Oh, right.
[3968.92s -> 3969.72s]  Need coffee.
[3970.28s -> 3973.46s]  They turned off the gas.
[3973.46s -> 3975.22s]  I can't even make a proper coffee anymore.
[3975.22s -> 3976.58s]  We really need to bring in more clients.
[3976.58s -> 3978.98s]  I'll reach out to Gordon and see if he has something else.
[3978.98s -> 3980.34s]  Haven't heard back from the police.
[3980.34s -> 3981.78s]  That thing sorted?
[3981.78s -> 3982.92s]  Supposed to be.
[3983.56s -> 3986.94s]  Thanks for helping me out with that building.
[3986.94s -> 3989.66s]  The police was snooping around a little bit,
[3989.66s -> 3992.94s]  but it seems to have cooled off now and we can finally start construction.
[3992.94s -> 3994.52s]  I actually have another job for you.
[3994.52s -> 3996.76s]  See, I bought this yacht recently,
[3996.84s -> 4000.60s]  and it's too large for the marina.
[4000.60s -> 4002.98s]  How much does marinara?
[4002.98s -> 4005.62s]  And the board says there's no space for a new dock.
[4005.62s -> 4008.41s]  Would you use your demolition skills again
[4008.41s -> 4010.49s]  and remove one of the timeshare cabins?
[4011.05s -> 4012.89s]  If the original documentation also disappeared,
[4012.89s -> 4017.59s]  then tada, like it was never there.
[4017.59s -> 4020.18s]  OK, so let's go.
[4020.74s -> 4026.04s]  Make room for Gordon's new yacht at the marina
[4026.60s -> 4028.92s]  by demolishing the outermost cabin.
[4028.92s -> 4040.12s]  Destroy proof of ownership by dumping safes in the ocean.
[4040.12s -> 4041.16s]  All right, let's go.
[4041.72s -> 4044.90s]  Let's escape.
[4045.46s -> 4047.78s]  I like the way this looks.
[4050.33s -> 4052.81s]  The outermost cabin needs to be destroyed.
[4052.81s -> 4057.82s]  There's a fire alarm and large fires will trigger a fire alarm.
[4057.82s -> 4059.50s]  OK, outermost cabin.
[4059.50s -> 4060.06s]  It's that one.
[4063.67s -> 4066.39s]  OK, there's the office safe is in there.
[4066.95s -> 4067.91s]  Throw that shit in the ocean.
[4067.91s -> 4069.11s]  Let's do that first.
[4069.11s -> 4080.95s]  There's still a cast register from the window of like the fucking Dairy Queen.
[4081.75s -> 4084.14s]  Why is it not detached?
[4085.90s -> 4087.26s]  I'm taking the ketchup and mustard too,
[4087.26s -> 4088.14s]  and I'm throwing it in the ocean.
[4088.14s -> 4095.88s]  I'm taking the cutting board.
[4096.76s -> 4100.39s]  I should come back from your break from work,
[4100.39s -> 4102.79s]  and there's no sign of entering,
[4103.43s -> 4105.99s]  but everything is gone and the register is gone too.
[4108.41s -> 4110.97s]  Like the register and the ketchup and mustard are gone.
[4110.97s -> 4112.33s]  It's like, OK.
[4112.97s -> 4114.89s]  Oh, and the window is destroyed too, I guess.
[4115.45s -> 4120.92s]  Oh, can I get glasses?
[4120.92s -> 4123.58s]  I'm just stealing shit.
[4125.86s -> 4127.86s]  That's like just fucking rude.
[4127.86s -> 4130.42s]  This is just awful, like environmental damage.
[4131.46s -> 4132.34s]  Why am I doing this?
[4133.06s -> 4133.94s]  Let's sneak in the back.
[4134.90s -> 4141.38s]  Anything else in here?
[4141.38s -> 4146.25s]  Impressive mustard selection.
[4146.25s -> 4157.06s]  Oops, very sneaky.
[4157.62s -> 4159.14s]  Yes, very sneaky.
[4159.14s -> 4169.93s]  This place, this person, people really like that energy drink.
[4170.49s -> 4171.37s]  I have one.
[4171.37s -> 4180.60s]  All right, let's move.
[4180.60s -> 4181.98s]  Oh, there was a door the whole time.
[4193.91s -> 4197.19s]  OK, if you looked out your back window at that exact moment
[4197.19s -> 4200.63s]  and there was a full wooden door that flew past your window into the water,
[4200.63s -> 4207.43s]  what would you do?
[4207.43s -> 4209.75s]  All right, we're going to throw the safe in the ocean.
[4213.50s -> 4215.34s]  All right, I'm going to be like the Grinch.
[4215.34s -> 4225.98s]  Oh shit, that's 30 bucks.
[4225.98s -> 4227.85s]  Oops, I was trying to open it.
[4233.19s -> 4236.79s]  You're a wild one, Mr. Grinch.
[4237.88s -> 4238.38s]  You're...
[4239.08s -> 4241.88s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.
[4242.44s -> 4244.36s]  No, no, no, you're supposed to be stealing toys.
[4245.08s -> 4259.98s]  Oh, what is this?
[4259.98s -> 4260.86s]  Valuables.
[4260.86s -> 4262.39s]  It's in the desk.
[4267.10s -> 4269.26s]  Shit, don't destroy all the lights, then I can't see.
[4270.38s -> 4271.26s]  Thinking face.
[4271.26s -> 4277.56s]  Expensive chairs, expensive wood, expensive...
[4277.56s -> 4279.83s]  What about up here?
[4280.47s -> 4286.50s]  Are there like company secrets in here?
[4288.28s -> 4289.56s]  Right, get on the table.
[4289.56s -> 4295.58s]  Fucking another light conch.
[4296.14s -> 4302.97s]  Nothing up here?
[4302.97s -> 4305.70s]  Oh, I have a flashlight.
[4305.70s -> 4306.66s]  Okay, that's helpful.
[4306.66s -> 4307.70s]  There's nothing up here.
[4307.70s -> 4312.50s]  All right, I got to get that safe.
[4313.06s -> 4318.98s]  Safe is behind me in the room behind me.
[4318.98s -> 4319.86s]  All right, there's the safe.
[4320.89s -> 4326.06s]  Throw the safe out the window into the ocean.
[4326.06s -> 4327.54s]  All right, where's the ocean?
[4328.10s -> 4329.78s]  All right, the ocean's right here.
[4340.58s -> 4341.08s]  Shit.
[4341.54s -> 4344.31s]  Okay, let's go into the ocean.
[4344.31s -> 4347.21s]  This thing's heavy.
[4347.21s -> 4347.71s]  Open it.
[4348.17s -> 4362.98s]  Come on, open.
[4368.79s -> 4377.40s]  Damn it, the safe is rated for fire.
[4377.40s -> 4378.04s]  Whatever.
[4378.04s -> 4383.69s]  You just welded it shut.
[4383.69s -> 4385.59s]  Can I throw it?
[4385.59s -> 4386.39s]  No, I can't throw it.
[4386.39s -> 4390.23s]  I have to just dump it around the edges.
[4422.07s -> 4423.59s]  Throw it overboard.
[4425.99s -> 4426.49s]  Push.
[4428.86s -> 4430.14s]  Get out of here.
[4430.14s -> 4436.44s]  What's the optional thing?
[4436.44s -> 4437.64s]  Warehouse safe?
[4437.64s -> 4440.25s]  There's another fucking safe.
[4440.25s -> 4441.85s]  All right, let's go.
[4441.85s -> 4454.23s]  There's a person?
[4454.23s -> 4455.03s]  Where?
[4455.03s -> 4457.27s]  I thought that was a person.
[4457.27s -> 4458.31s]  You're right, I thought it was a person.
[4458.95s -> 4460.84s]  I see a danger sign.
[4460.84s -> 4462.04s]  Okay, don't do that.
[4462.04s -> 4467.88s]  It was opening for me.
[4468.44s -> 4472.42s]  All right, where's the other safe?
[4477.24s -> 4478.20s]  It's the wrong warehouse.
[4494.04s -> 4495.16s]  Be careful, be careful.
[4499.10s -> 4500.62s]  Now, fuck it, I'm just gonna drive through.
[4500.62s -> 4501.12s]  Who cares?
[4501.74s -> 4502.46s]  Save the game.
[4503.02s -> 4503.98s]  Okay, I got it.
[4503.98s -> 4511.75s]  Forklift.
[4511.75s -> 4514.73s]  Forklift, forklift, fork, fork, fork, fork.
[4514.73s -> 4525.08s]  Forklift?
[4525.08s -> 4532.95s]  All right, then we gotta go all the way down in here.
[4532.95s -> 4534.15s]  Forklift certified.
[4534.15s -> 4534.65s]  Hypers.
[4535.19s -> 4539.85s]  All right, we're in.
[4539.85s -> 4541.69s]  Wait, should I take the daddy forklift?
[4541.69s -> 4542.33s]  Yeah.
[4542.33s -> 4544.14s]  I don't want the baby forklift anymore.
[4544.14s -> 4545.18s]  I want the daddy forklift.
[4553.98s -> 4555.18s]  All right, lift.
[4555.18s -> 4561.30s]  This is safe.
[4561.30s -> 4562.42s]  All right, wait, wait, wait.
[4562.42s -> 4563.38s]  I gotta put it on the forklift.
[4563.86s -> 4569.35s]  Why can't this raise?
[4569.35s -> 4569.83s]  All right, there we go.
[4569.83s -> 4570.39s]  Ready?
[4570.39s -> 4571.11s]  Check this shit out.
[4571.67s -> 4575.78s]  It's gonna be-
[4575.78s -> 4585.86s]  I'm gonna get it right on the forklift.
[4585.86s -> 4586.50s]  Got it?
[4586.50s -> 4588.18s]  I got it, right?
[4588.18s -> 4588.98s]  Okay, let's get it out.
[4592.62s -> 4593.34s]  Shit, it's okay.
[4593.90s -> 4603.82s]  There's too much shit all over the ground.
[4603.82s -> 4608.12s]  We're just going out the easy way.
[4608.12s -> 4609.64s]  Fuck, I can't get it-
[4609.64s -> 4610.84s]  I can't throw it this way.
[4610.84s -> 4611.88s]  It's all right, we'll drag it out here.
[4634.58s -> 4638.46s]  Yeah, a nice perfect square.
[4638.46s -> 4644.65s]  Dude, new emote incoming.
[4644.65s -> 4645.85s]  Derma slug torch.
[4645.85s -> 4659.59s]  All right, be gone.
[4659.59s -> 4663.94s]  Be gone with you.
[4663.94s -> 4668.79s]  Into the ocean.
[4668.79s -> 4669.51s]  Counts.
[4669.51s -> 4670.63s]  It counts.
[4670.63s -> 4671.67s]  It counts.
[4679.38s -> 4685.69s]  All right, die if I go in the water.
[4685.69s -> 4688.57s]  Whoa.
[4688.57s -> 4692.66s]  That's on fire.
[4692.66s -> 4693.14s]  That's on fire.
[4693.14s -> 4694.82s]  That's on fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
[4694.82s -> 4706.15s]  Just cover it in state puff marshmallow man.
[4706.15s -> 4718.41s]  The state puff marshmallow man saves the day again.
[4718.41s -> 4721.37s]  Wait, there's probably like hidden secret gems in here.
[4721.37s -> 4722.87s]  Look at this.
[4722.87s -> 4724.15s]  Are you serious?
[4724.15s -> 4725.46s]  You don't think I'm gonna do this?
[4725.46s -> 4727.38s]  There's probably secret hidden gems over here.
[4727.38s -> 4740.42s]  Come on.
[4740.42s -> 4741.22s]  Secret gem?
[4741.22s -> 4743.24s]  I see gems.
[4743.24s -> 4748.12s]  No, that's just guts of the car.
[4748.12s -> 4748.68s]  Really?
[4748.68s -> 4759.22s]  Isn't a secret like valuable in there?
[4759.22s -> 4761.88s]  Oh, my computer can run this game.
[4761.88s -> 4763.72s]  This is more optimized than Watch Dogs.
[4763.72s -> 4772.22s]  And this game, I think, is made by like four people.
[4772.22s -> 4775.50s]  Every single thing in this game is a physics-based object.
[4776.06s -> 4777.42s]  Every single thing in the whole game.
[4782.71s -> 4783.91s]  And it's running flawlessly.
[4784.55s -> 4785.99s]  I open up the game Watch Dogs,
[4785.99s -> 4788.39s]  which has like a 500 trillion dollar budget
[4788.39s -> 4790.15s]  and like a thousand people working on it.
[4790.87s -> 4801.10s]  Whatever.
[4801.10s -> 4803.02s]  I'll just drive the go-kart.
[4806.23s -> 4807.11s]  What is that?
[4807.11s -> 4810.89s]  Why is there like water coming out of the car?
[4811.45s -> 4814.28s]  Is that oil?
[4815.08s -> 4816.92s]  I mean, it looks pretty sick though, don't you think?
[4824.70s -> 4825.34s]  We're gonna go back here.
[4836.86s -> 4837.26s]  All right.
[4837.26s -> 4838.86s]  Uh, there's the escape vehicle.
[4839.74s -> 4840.94s]  There's the thing I have to destroy.
[4840.94s -> 4841.34s]  Let's go.
[4841.98s -> 4843.45s]  New car.
[4844.54s -> 4845.02s]  New car.
[4845.74s -> 4846.78s]  And this one's wet.
[4850.36s -> 4851.48s]  It's fast too.
[4851.48s -> 4852.52s]  This is a fast car.
[4853.32s -> 4855.34s]  All right.
[4855.34s -> 4856.38s]  Which one do I have to destroy?
[4857.02s -> 4867.00s]  Not that one.
[4868.01s -> 4869.13s]  Not that one.
[4869.13s -> 4869.61s]  Oh, get out!
[4869.61s -> 4870.01s]  Get out!
[4876.76s -> 4877.32s]  Anybody home?
[4882.49s -> 4883.21s]  Holy shit.
[4883.77s -> 4884.33s]  What was that?
[4884.89s -> 4889.27s]  It's just free stuff in every house.
[4889.83s -> 4896.84s]  What's this?
[4896.84s -> 4900.06s]  Oh, nothing.
[4900.06s -> 4902.84s]  All right.
[4902.84s -> 4904.15s]  Open this.
[4904.15s -> 4904.79s]  Damn it.
[4904.79s -> 4907.35s]  Everything's like a magic box of goodies.
[4907.35s -> 4911.50s]  Did I just throw their bed out the window?
[4912.06s -> 4913.34s]  That mean?
[4913.34s -> 4913.98s]  That's kind of mean.
[4914.54s -> 4916.54s]  I mean, yeah.
[4916.54s -> 4918.62s]  Look, at this point, if you're gonna do that,
[4918.62s -> 4920.22s]  you might as well just go all in.
[4920.22s -> 4922.82s]  And just hope they get like all the insurance money.
[4922.82s -> 4925.06s]  Like, let them write all this shit off.
[4925.06s -> 4926.81s]  If I'm gonna look, if you're gonna go in
[4926.81s -> 4928.09s]  and like throw the person's bed out the window,
[4929.13s -> 4931.69s]  just let them have like the $400,000 check.
[4931.69s -> 4932.17s]  You know what I mean?
[4933.83s -> 4935.03s]  Don't just like break the bed.
[4935.03s -> 4935.91s]  Because then it's like, fuck.
[4944.65s -> 4946.17s]  Mr. Beast.
[4946.17s -> 4946.49s]  All right.
[4946.49s -> 4947.37s]  This is the one.
[4947.37s -> 4948.33s]  This is the one.
[4948.33s -> 4951.13s]  I have to destroy this.
[4952.50s -> 4952.98s]  This is such...
[4952.98s -> 4953.86s]  Wait, hold on.
[4953.86s -> 4956.79s]  I like love this house.
[4956.79s -> 4963.10s]  Is it weird that I love this?
[4963.82s -> 4967.51s]  It's like what a view of the ocean,
[4967.51s -> 4968.63s]  right where your bed is.
[4968.63s -> 4969.99s]  It's just a little spot.
[4969.99s -> 4973.14s]  It's like you can eat dinner over here.
[4973.14s -> 4974.34s]  You put like a little...
[4974.34s -> 4975.62s]  I love this place.
[4975.62s -> 4979.83s]  Perfect little bathroom.
[4981.30s -> 4982.34s]  This is sick.
[4982.34s -> 4983.22s]  No kitchen.
[4983.22s -> 4983.70s]  Who cares?
[4983.70s -> 4984.90s]  I don't cook anyways.
[4984.90s -> 4987.94s]  I would actually prefer a house with no kitchen.
[4996.33s -> 4997.93s]  Like if I could have no kitchen,
[4997.93s -> 5001.80s]  an extra room for like,
[5001.80s -> 5003.16s]  I don't know, like a shelf or something.
[5004.04s -> 5006.36s]  Or like extra TV space or extra...
[5006.36s -> 5008.76s]  Yeah, I don't even use my kitchen.
[5018.57s -> 5020.33s]  Okay, so this will work pretty easily, right?
[5025.86s -> 5026.58s]  Fire alert.
[5031.22s -> 5032.98s]  Okay, at what point does it become too much?
[5035.78s -> 5037.22s]  Okay, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out,
[5037.22s -> 5038.34s]  put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out,
[5038.34s -> 5039.70s]  put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out.
[5041.75s -> 5042.71s]  Put it out, put it out.
[5047.03s -> 5048.23s]  Okay, we just have to get it to a point
[5048.23s -> 5052.54s]  where the fire alarm doesn't go off.
[5052.54s -> 5053.74s]  And just don't spread to this house.
[5068.70s -> 5069.74s]  This is crazy.
[5075.80s -> 5077.64s]  I know I've made a...
[5077.64s -> 5079.00s]  Looking out your window reference
[5079.00s -> 5080.20s]  like five times this stream.
[5080.20s -> 5082.36s]  But looking out this window here
[5082.36s -> 5084.84s]  and being like, oh, come the fuck on, dude.
[5102.90s -> 5104.66s]  It's like, what the fuck are you doing?
[5105.22s -> 5119.59s]  If I fall in the water, do I die?
[5122.94s -> 5124.30s]  All right, now let's clean the rest up.
[5128.49s -> 5130.17s]  Good, that's tall enough where it'll get there.
[5130.89s -> 5132.17s]  Okay, cool.
[5132.17s -> 5132.89s]  Is that gonna hurt me?
[5133.61s -> 5135.14s]  Irma, what are you doing?
[5135.70s -> 5138.18s]  It told me to burn the place down.
[5138.18s -> 5140.58s]  It said burn, it said destroy this place.
[5141.38s -> 5153.21s]  I don't let that get too out of control.
[5153.21s -> 5153.77s]  What is this?
[5157.85s -> 5158.65s]  All right, it's, hold on.
[5158.65s -> 5164.94s]  It's starting to use the boat, punching.
[5200.60s -> 5204.04s]  Oh my God, the boat's on fire.
[5204.04s -> 5205.64s]  Oh God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
[5205.64s -> 5206.44s]  Oh my, what do I do?
[5206.44s -> 5207.24s]  How do I get out?
[5207.24s -> 5209.24s]  Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get safe.
[5209.24s -> 5213.82s]  What is holding this up still?
[5213.82s -> 5215.98s]  Drop it into the ocean.
[5218.23s -> 5220.97s]  Oh boy, fall.
[5221.61s -> 5229.85s]  Oh no, don't burn.
[5229.85s -> 5234.49s]  Okay, I need to, we have to cut it off.
[5241.75s -> 5243.83s]  Oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit.
[5244.39s -> 5257.67s]  Okay, I gotta, do I die if you go in the water?
[5257.67s -> 5259.11s]  Do you die if you go in the water?
[5259.11s -> 5261.53s]  Do you die if you go in the water?
[5262.09s -> 5272.70s]  No, shit, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[5272.70s -> 5274.54s]  I'm sorry, it'll be repaired.
[5274.54s -> 5275.88s]  Here, I got it.
[5289.11s -> 5292.98s]  I'm out.
[5292.98s -> 5293.54s]  Did you drown?
[5296.84s -> 5297.96s]  Is firework underwater?
[5300.30s -> 5301.18s]  All right, escape.
[5301.18s -> 5302.22s]  That was kind of fun.
[5302.22s -> 5303.02s]  That was cool.
[5303.02s -> 5304.22s]  This game's really cool.
[5304.22s -> 5305.18s]  This game's awesome.
[5305.82s -> 5308.57s]  I'm serious, this is really good.
[5309.21s -> 5312.87s]  Okay, escape vehicle is, oh, right here.
[5319.93s -> 5320.97s]  Destroy all the houses.
[5327.29s -> 5328.33s]  Here, I'll do this for you.
[5347.05s -> 5358.47s]  Too high.
[5358.47s -> 5361.19s]  Shit, too high.
[5361.19s -> 5366.12s]  All right, last try.
[5366.12s -> 5373.42s]  Damn it, whatever.
[5373.42s -> 5382.87s]  Throw wood that's on fire and I'm the maniac.
[5382.87s -> 5385.26s]  It can't be like burning down this building.
[5385.26s -> 5386.63s]  You psycho.
[5386.63s -> 5388.55s]  Wow, like this is not even like funny.
[5388.55s -> 5392.15s]  Hey dude, stand like really safe distance back
[5392.15s -> 5394.15s]  and throw burning material into the other houses
[5394.15s -> 5395.43s]  that have nothing to do with the mission.
[5395.43s -> 5396.47s]  You psycho.
[5402.02s -> 5405.56s]  Porn week, see you next week for Porn Week.
[5405.56s -> 5407.48s]  You reached a new rank, a new tool has been delivered.
[5414.34s -> 5416.74s]  Oh, I have to fix my own house.
[5416.74s -> 5417.46s]  It's raining.
[5418.02s -> 5426.63s]  It has to be perfect or I can't move on.
[5426.63s -> 5431.85s]  I don't care, just let me in.
[5431.85s -> 5438.68s]  Look, I have a better idea.
[5438.68s -> 5441.11s]  I have to go all the way down to the soil.
[5441.11s -> 5445.59s]  Oh, bathroom?
[5445.59s -> 5450.25s]  This is a really, really weird stall.
[5450.25s -> 5452.09s]  I feel like you could see everything.
[5452.09s -> 5457.75s]  Isn't this enormous?
[5457.75s -> 5459.43s]  Why do I have a stall in my house?
[5459.43s -> 5462.38s]  A new tool has been delivered.
[5462.38s -> 5465.19s]  New tool, shotgun.
[5465.19s -> 5468.36s]  It's actually a shotgun.
[5468.36s -> 5470.20s]  That was just a really stupid joke.
[5470.20s -> 5471.88s]  It's an actual shotgun.
[5471.88s -> 5487.56s]  Why is this game so good?
[5488.36s -> 5489.40s]  This is so cool.
[5490.04s -> 5491.72s]  Am I out of bullets?
[5496.66s -> 5497.62s]  How do you reload?
[5497.62s -> 5503.85s]  Classic cars.
[5503.85s -> 5505.45s]  Fantastic work at the marina.
[5506.25s -> 5507.77s]  Looks like it worked because they just cleared
[5507.77s -> 5509.21s]  a construction permit for the new dock.
[5510.09s -> 5511.29s]  Another thing came up.
[5511.29s -> 5513.61s]  It was this classic car auction up in the Black River
[5513.61s -> 5516.65s]  the other day and one guy just kept overbidding me.
[5517.70s -> 5519.94s]  Lawrence Lee Jr., that youngster who inherited
[5519.94s -> 5521.22s]  the chemical plant a few years ago,
[5521.22s -> 5523.06s]  absolutely no interest in cars.
[5523.06s -> 5526.18s]  He's just looking for ways to rotate his dirty money.
[5526.18s -> 5531.42s]  Okay, it's this thing.
[5531.42s -> 5533.58s]  The one they used in Seal the Deal 2
[5533.58s -> 5536.22s]  and Colonel Wilson's personal,
[5536.22s -> 5537.90s]  Jacobi from Normandy.
[5537.90s -> 5540.89s]  Lee is about to put those cars on a ship overseas
[5540.89s -> 5542.97s]  in a day now and they'll be out of the country for good.
[5544.02s -> 5547.03s]  If that's not criminal, I don't know what is.
[5547.03s -> 5549.35s]  Can you help me acquire these two gems?
[5549.35s -> 5550.98s]  I'll take good care of them.
[5550.98s -> 5553.67s]  Okay, we gotta steal classic cars.
[5553.67s -> 5556.52s]  Get the two classic cars for Gordon.
[5556.52s -> 5558.44s]  Drive them to the marked area at the back of the truck.
[5558.44s -> 5560.36s]  If possible, also pick up spare parts
[5560.36s -> 5563.46s]  and vehicle registration documents.
[5563.46s -> 5565.54s]  No, my tools, my tools, my tools.
[5575.53s -> 5576.81s]  He's stealing.
[5578.86s -> 5580.62s]  Was stealing worse than burning a house down?
[5581.26s -> 5585.99s]  Okay, sledge, no upgrades.
[5585.99s -> 5587.11s]  Spray can, no upgrades.
[5587.11s -> 5587.83s]  Fire extinguisher, no.
[5587.83s -> 5588.63s]  Blow torch, no.
[5588.63s -> 5589.19s]  Shotgun.
[5592.07s -> 5594.55s]  Ooh, range damage.
[5594.55s -> 5595.43s]  How much money do I have?
[5600.52s -> 5603.40s]  Okay, I could range damage, no, damage rounds.
[5604.12s -> 5613.58s]  And, all right, there's another one.
[5613.58s -> 5616.62s]  I've been up all night digging through the login devices
[5616.62s -> 5619.42s]  and managed to find a connection to the West Point Marina.
[5619.42s -> 5621.48s]  I haven't been able to figure out more on BT,
[5621.48s -> 5622.92s]  but Lee has a warehouse in West Point.
[5622.92s -> 5625.08s]  I guess whatever fishy business he's up to,
[5625.08s -> 5627.00s]  the marina is not the final destination.
[5627.00s -> 5629.88s]  I was thinking the boat GPS device can give me an idea
[5629.88s -> 5631.85s]  where he's moving the product,
[5631.85s -> 5634.25s]  especially if I could compare their recent destinations
[5634.25s -> 5634.89s]  to the shipping log.
[5634.89s -> 5635.85s]  Can you get them for me?
[5635.85s -> 5637.21s]  Are we just, are we a double agent here?
[5642.52s -> 5644.86s]  This is a double agent.
[5644.86s -> 5645.58s]  Watch the news.
[5646.14s -> 5650.52s]  According to harbor master Jim Delish,
[5651.96s -> 5653.24s]  we searched through all available records,
[5653.24s -> 5655.56s]  but no proof of a fifth cabin could be found.
[5655.56s -> 5663.58s]  Without evidence, the rumors still persist of a ghost cabin.
[5663.58s -> 5665.66s]  Next week, art or remnants from the afterlife.
[5665.66s -> 5668.54s]  Oh, wait, we're gaslighting the neighbors
[5668.54s -> 5674.76s]  that that person's house never existed.
[5674.76s -> 5676.44s]  I mean, couldn't the neighbor clearly just be like,
[5676.44s -> 5679.56s]  hey, there's a shitload of damage right where the dock meets
[5680.55s -> 5683.93s]  and there's a hole in my house.
[5683.93s -> 5686.01s]  Oh, and I saw the guy outside.
[5686.01s -> 5697.16s]  I didn't like that fucking chair or that picture.
[5697.16s -> 5700.26s]  All right, let's do the classic cars one.
[5700.26s -> 5701.14s]  That sounds fun.
[5701.14s -> 5707.51s]  It's unexplainable, dude.
[5707.51s -> 5714.23s]  Okay, classic cars.
[5714.23s -> 5716.58s]  What do we got?
[5716.58s -> 5719.06s]  Car in warehouse, car on ship.
[5719.06s -> 5721.53s]  Do I go to documents in office?
[5721.53s -> 5722.65s]  All right, let's go get this one first.
[5724.10s -> 5727.43s]  Wait, no, let's get this one first.
[5728.70s -> 5732.94s]  This one is car in warehouse and spare parts.
[5732.94s -> 5734.30s]  Let's go to the warehouse.
[5734.30s -> 5751.54s]  Bangle right, shotgun.
[5751.54s -> 5753.46s]  Wait, check the warehouse for materials.
[5757.19s -> 5758.07s]  Easy mode is over.
[5758.79s -> 5760.76s]  I was, what do you mean easy mode?
[5761.32s -> 5765.05s]  Ooh, aluminum propeller.
[5765.05s -> 5765.85s]  That's 60 bucks.
[5766.49s -> 5769.27s]  Oh, what's that?
[5775.53s -> 5778.17s]  Misaka premium spark plugs, 80 bucks.
[5778.17s -> 5786.95s]  Drive car out of just two drop-off point.
[5786.95s -> 5792.54s]  I'm gonna use a boat to get there.
[5809.86s -> 5811.62s]  $80 spark plugs.
[5811.62s -> 5812.34s]  Oh, mega.
[5812.90s -> 5820.73s]  All right, is that a car?
[5822.78s -> 5823.82s]  Car is inside.
[5823.82s -> 5825.42s]  All right, let's, I want to get this in a good spot.
[5827.85s -> 5832.01s]  Say toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,
[5832.01s -> 5833.61s]  toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[5833.61s -> 5834.17s]  Get out of here.
[5834.17s -> 5834.57s]  What do you think?
[5834.57s -> 5835.85s]  I'm not talented enough to do that.
[5845.27s -> 5846.07s]  Is it money in the oven?
[5846.63s -> 5848.55s]  Money in the fridge.
[5849.50s -> 5850.14s]  Room.
[5850.14s -> 5853.74s]  Anything on the shelves?
[5855.42s -> 5858.44s]  No.
[5858.44s -> 5859.72s]  You used a sound board?
[5860.52s -> 5860.92s]  What?
[5860.92s -> 5864.57s]  Think of a money.
[5864.57s -> 5867.21s]  Think of things to steal that cost money.
[5867.21s -> 5867.93s]  Okay, there it is.
[5868.49s -> 5869.78s]  Not yet.
[5870.42s -> 5879.93s]  Anything valuable in here?
[5879.93s -> 5882.17s]  This office chair looks pretty valuable.
[5882.97s -> 5889.66s]  I haven't used doors.
[5891.03s -> 5894.87s]  Mr. Amenatides, visit Lee's birthday, other topics.
[5895.43s -> 5896.79s]  Now you'll forget that one.
[5896.79s -> 5899.50s]  Wait, this has an alarm on it.
[5916.95s -> 5917.91s]  60 seconds?
[5923.19s -> 5923.75s]  Wait, why am I?
[5941.61s -> 5955.29s]  All right, are you cool if you just get one?
[5955.29s -> 5956.41s]  So here's the deal.
[5956.41s -> 5958.94s]  You have to do the cars first.
[5958.94s -> 5961.94s]  Then I gotta come back and do these if I want to.
[5961.94s -> 5977.14s]  Just drive this.
[5977.14s -> 5980.74s]  Where's the drop-off point?
[5980.74s -> 5985.53s]  All right, there's the drop-off point right here.
[5985.53s -> 5988.06s]  Just get to the drop-off point.
[5988.06s -> 5998.26s]  What the fuck are you stuck on?
[5998.26s -> 6001.48s]  Put the bed down.
[6001.48s -> 6002.68s]  It's gonna hit a bunch of shit.
[6002.68s -> 6010.25s]  Just don't let the thing fall off.
[6010.25s -> 6011.21s]  There's no time limit.
[6019.14s -> 6020.90s]  If it was up, it would smash into stuff.
[6023.56s -> 6028.22s]  Okay, now, so get it here.
[6028.22s -> 6038.63s]  Okay, here's the plan.
[6038.63s -> 6039.51s]  I'm gonna give you the plan.
[6040.50s -> 6046.31s]  Plan is, do not unplug this yet.
[6046.31s -> 6047.27s]  Keep it right there.
[6047.27s -> 6048.39s]  Get the other one.
[6048.39s -> 6059.59s]  I'll get the other one.
[6059.59s -> 6060.15s]  Save it.
[6060.15s -> 6065.98s]  The other one's over here.
[6065.98s -> 6071.29s]  All right, isn't it right here?
[6071.29s -> 6072.17s]  Melt this shit.
[6072.17s -> 6085.30s]  Let's take a look.
[6085.30s -> 6087.46s]  Other car is, it's not here.
[6087.46s -> 6089.78s]  Somebody got here before I did, and they took it.
[6089.78s -> 6098.94s]  It's here.
[6098.94s -> 6101.56s]  But unfortunately, this one is also plugged in.
[6101.56s -> 6107.82s]  I have to forklift this.
[6107.82s -> 6109.75s]  I gotta forklift this all the way out.
[6109.75s -> 6114.71s]  Let's make some room.
[6114.71s -> 6117.54s]  Can I drive the boat?
[6117.54s -> 6122.62s]  Oh, shit, you can drive the boat.
[6122.62s -> 6127.10s]  Okay, so this is gonna be like a James Bond movie.
[6127.10s -> 6128.46s]  Get this over here.
[6128.46s -> 6129.58s]  We're gonna park it right there,
[6129.58s -> 6130.78s]  so I can just drive over there.
[6130.78s -> 6131.66s]  All right, go, go, go, go.
[6131.66s -> 6132.38s]  I got it.
[6132.38s -> 6133.99s]  I got the idea.
[6133.99s -> 6151.77s]  Put on Mission Impossible music.
[6152.90s -> 6155.78s]  Well, in the world of new Twitch DMCA's,
[6155.78s -> 6157.94s]  I don't think that that's a good idea anymore.
[6169.90s -> 6171.18s]  No more Doom music.
[6171.18s -> 6172.62s]  Well, I don't think that's accurate.
[6177.58s -> 6178.14s]  Oh, dear.
[6180.98s -> 6182.82s]  We're dropping lots of frames right now.
[6184.07s -> 6185.43s]  Why is this so frame-ready?
[6185.43s -> 6187.54s]  Okay. All right.
[6187.54s -> 6188.98s]  Don't move, don't move, don't move, don't move.
[6188.98s -> 6190.74s]  Oh, don't, hey, don't, shh.

[6202.15s -> 6203.51s]  It's perfect.
[6203.51s -> 6204.79s]  It's fucking perfect.
[6206.62s -> 6208.30s]  Okay, don't touch anything.
[6208.30s -> 6217.13s]  It's fucking perfect.
[6217.13s -> 6218.65s]  All right, we're gonna have to melt this.
[6218.65s -> 6226.57s]  Just to make sure it can fit in here.
[6226.57s -> 6243.80s]  That's not gonna, that fits through there, right?
[6247.50s -> 6248.38s]  It's absolutely perfect.
[6248.38s -> 6250.82s]  Okay, now, save the game.
[6250.82s -> 6252.66s]  Now, this is where it gets tricky.
[6252.66s -> 6254.92s]  Now, I gotta go steal this stuff.
[6254.92s -> 6256.17s]  I gotta get a car.
[6256.81s -> 6260.10s]  And I gotta go, we're gonna go here, steal this,
[6260.10s -> 6263.62s]  boat, steal this, car, drive, everything go in.
[6263.62s -> 6266.94s]  The ship is sinking right now.
[6266.94s -> 6267.74s]  It is?
[6267.74s -> 6273.43s]  No, it isn't, it's fine.
[6273.43s -> 6277.67s]  You see money?
[6277.67s -> 6282.04s]  Okay, I need a car.
[6282.04s -> 6283.16s]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[6284.22s -> 6285.50s]  Oh, this is cool.
[6285.50s -> 6288.68s]  All right, we gotta go here first.
[6288.68s -> 6290.71s]  Let's get up there and I'm saving it.
[6290.71s -> 6292.79s]  I'm ready to James Bond the fuck out of this.
[6292.79s -> 6296.58s]  I got a perfect ramp.
[6296.58s -> 6309.10s]  I'm ready to, that's gonna take less than 15 seconds.
[6309.10s -> 6312.74s]  Wait, I know a lot of you just were about to Pepe left.
[6312.74s -> 6316.47s]  I gotta get this all the way across to the other side,
[6316.47s -> 6318.55s]  to the other building after I James Bond one way.
[6320.82s -> 6322.26s]  I need a car to drive down here.
[6322.82s -> 6325.03s]  All right, let's do it.
[6326.71s -> 6346.71s]  Okay, let's, am I gonna do anything else besides that part?
[6346.71s -> 6349.00s]  Turn this around.
[6352.74s -> 6353.62s]  DMCA?
[6353.62s -> 6355.46s]  You can't DMCA ass voice.
[6356.26s -> 6363.50s]  You cannot, don't break that.
[6363.50s -> 6364.38s]  Okay, this is ready.
[6364.38s -> 6365.34s]  It's gonna line it up.
[6366.23s -> 6367.43s]  Go, it's ready.
[6372.49s -> 6375.74s]  So the plan, that's there.
[6377.27s -> 6378.92s]  This is, hear me out.
[6378.92s -> 6380.36s]  Start here, grab it.
[6381.16s -> 6381.80s]  Out the window.
[6383.86s -> 6384.42s]  Into a boat.
[6385.62s -> 6386.42s]  Across the water.
[6391.46s -> 6397.78s]  Down, in here.
[6399.93s -> 6401.43s]  Over here, park it.
[6403.05s -> 6403.55s]  In there.
[6406.89s -> 6413.39s]  Yeah, that was the Pirate's Thief song.
[6413.39s -> 6416.43s]  I was just trying to do it so shitty so that I couldn't get DMCA'd.
[6416.43s -> 6418.19s]  You can't DMCA a shitty sound.
[6418.19s -> 6425.04s]  That's like, okay, you know like the Lord of the Rings song like that.
[6430.88s -> 6433.56s]  Just change it a little and you're fine.
[6433.56s -> 6434.06s]  So like.
[6448.14s -> 6450.11s]  See?
[6450.11s -> 6452.99s]  And then you could just say, that's my original song.
[6452.99s -> 6455.07s]  It's not, it's completely, the notes are completely different.
[6458.41s -> 6458.91s]  Ready?
[6458.91s -> 6473.80s]  Let's do it.
[6473.80s -> 6475.00s]  Just change one note.
[6477.16s -> 6480.97s]  I would, we'd be grateful if you didn't do that anymore.
[6480.97s -> 6482.41s]  And do what?
[6486.56s -> 6487.84s]  You got, you got something to say?
[6488.40s -> 6489.68s]  Wait, what do you got something to say?
[6497.02s -> 6497.66s]  I'm gonna save it.
[6497.66s -> 6498.94s]  We'll see if I can get this to work.
[6503.07s -> 6505.07s]  So the deal is here.
[6505.07s -> 6507.58s]  Okay, where is this?
[6507.58s -> 6509.10s]  Okay, right, right, right, it's upstairs.
[6509.10s -> 6510.24s]  All right, I'm gonna quick save it.
[6510.88s -> 6515.32s]  And we're going right off this fucking window.
[6515.32s -> 6520.57s]  Right in this window, to a boat.
[6520.57s -> 6522.76s]  All right, make it easy.
[6522.76s -> 6523.26s]  Boat.
[6524.12s -> 6527.37s]  Jump.
[6527.37s -> 6527.87s]  One.
[6529.34s -> 6538.53s]  I thought it was gonna be a jump.
[6538.53s -> 6539.57s]  I thought it was gonna be a cool jump.
[6539.57s -> 6539.97s]  I'm sorry.
[6539.97s -> 6543.23s]  I thought it was gonna be a cool jump.
[6543.23s -> 6543.79s]  Wasn't cool.
[6544.35s -> 6545.71s]  I thought I was gonna launch.
[6545.71s -> 6556.90s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6556.90s -> 6558.42s]  This is just like a relay race.
[6559.14s -> 6573.57s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6573.57s -> 6579.17s]  Watch it.
[6580.19s -> 6580.69s]  Fuck!
[6581.54s -> 6582.42s]  Shit!
[6582.42s -> 6584.02s]  I got time, I got time, time, time, time, time.
[6584.02s -> 6586.02s]  I got time, I got time, I got time, I got time, I got time.
[6586.58s -> 6594.43s]  Where is it?
[6594.43s -> 6595.47s]  Oh shit, it's back here.
[6596.27s -> 6596.99s]  It was a little sloppy.
[6596.99s -> 6597.49s]  It's okay.
[6614.62s -> 6620.13s]  And not even close.
[6620.85s -> 6622.21s]  I could probably do it if I get it clean.
[6622.53s -> 6630.59s]  Turn the cars in first
[6651.45s -> 6666.42s]  You did it again, ah
[6666.90s -> 6668.90s]  It's so hard to turn
[6668.90s -> 6688.54s]  Whatever. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I it's gonna get that turn right now. I'll get it. I'm gonna get it
[6688.66s -> 6694.77s]  I'll get it next time. I'll get it next time. I'm gonna get it next time
[6694.77s -> 6701.81s]  I'm gonna absolutely get it next time 100% chance that I get it right this time. Just don't crash the van
[6702.09s -> 6766.14s]  This is the one that's the one. Yeah, go wait. Wait, wait, wait, what? How do I leave? Okay, that was fun
[6766.18s -> 6774.14s]  What is this? It shows you the route you took. Oh, yeah
[6774.58s -> 6792.34s]  Take a look at that perfectly executed. I messed up a little on the turn on this right turn here
[6792.34s -> 6806.66s]  It was a little too heavy on the handbrake. Yeah a little too much. Just his hair. Oops
[6806.66s -> 6816.90s]  I was trying to back up into the circle so it would register. How about this? Come on. Look at this setup
[6816.90s -> 6837.47s]  You tell me to look at this raise the bridge. No, thank you. Let's go a 14 only have $260
[6837.47s -> 6842.04s]  I did every optional thing too. That's all I get
[6842.56s -> 6859.23s]  What did a lot am I corn I eat this was taxes
[6859.77s -> 6883.92s]  Really? It was taxes. I had to pay taxes. We got all right about tools anything new
[6883.92s -> 6893.10s]  I want to upgrade the sledgehammer now keep the money. Okay, not really demolition
[6893.10s -> 6899.78s]  But you don't know me but I've had a series of break-ins recently in the last one
[6899.78s -> 6903.98s]  I lost two very rare classic cars and guess what I know who did it
[6904.46s -> 6910.82s]  Gordon whoo that absolute prick is now bragging to everyone at the club about his two new fave possessions
[6910.82s -> 6915.54s]  The break-ins caused me a lot of property damage and I'd like to let Gordon take some of his own medicine
[6915.74s -> 6919.50s]  Since you're in the demolition industry, I thought well, I don't know if you do this sort of work
[6919.50s -> 6924.98s]  Well, let me know if it sounds interesting. Yeah, dude. Let's just go play the complete opposite
[6925.50s -> 6931.34s]  the home of mall manager and racing enthusiast Gordon whoo his daughter Freya and finance
[6931.82s -> 6936.46s]  Inid Cummins an exclusive mansion with a private racetrack in the backyard
[6936.90s -> 6949.95s]  Dump at least three of Gordon's expensive cars in the water. Oh, what about the news shit?
[6950.11s -> 6962.62s]  All right dump some cars in the water. This dude has like a military base for a house
[6963.34s -> 6970.65s]  Wired alarm boxes breaking an alarm box or wire triggers the alarm, right?
[6971.13s -> 6983.46s]  Okay, I'm gonna dump them in the ocean. Oh, this doesn't do anything. You got to be kidding. This dude probably has
[6984.10s -> 6992.26s]  Tons of money in this house. I won't forget bingo at the marina
[6993.97s -> 6995.97s]  Forget about the cars. I'm just gonna take a bunch of money
[6996.29s -> 7005.05s]  This is the first mission and hitman 2 this game just is hitman 2 with breaking things
[7005.39s -> 7025.47s]  This is just break stuff hitman. I take the painting upper class table manners. Damn you got strong windows
[7026.05s -> 7039.94s]  Okay, this is too big. I hate this. This is this place. Okay, I want my entire house or apartment or wherever
[7039.94s -> 7047.21s]  I only want it to be like this big. It's too I hate that everything about this
[7047.37s -> 7057.35s]  It's too much. It's too much space. We have your own
[7058.03s -> 7068.78s]  You have your own personal grocery store. It's too big. This is sauna. It's too much. It's too huge
[7068.78s -> 7077.26s]  I would get my dad is a sauna. I knew it. Of course there is no I don't want a sauna in my house
[7077.26s -> 7084.13s]  Do you know how much maintenance goes into this as you cannot treat a sauna like you treat your toilet bowl?
[7084.23s -> 7090.23s]  Like I guess it's been like few months might as well like stick the thing in there and brush around the edges of the disgusting
[7090.23s -> 7103.18s]  Stuff that's in there. Oh, you have to be somebody has to take care of this every single fucking minute of every day months
[7103.18s -> 7104.76s]  Well, I mean like a week
[7104.76s -> 7107.33s]  vacuum cleaner
[7107.33s -> 7123.61s]  What do you have all these explosives? What's this? I say hit the light exactly. It's got to be valuables here
[7124.13s -> 7132.01s]  Rich people can pay for that. Yeah, I know but
[7132.75s -> 7136.26s]  It's like why?
[7136.26s -> 7144.13s]  Look having a nice house is one thing but having like two saunas in your house having an elevator in your house
[7144.41s -> 7152.91s]  It's like this is I would hate this I this is just and you anybody that can see through here
[7153.15s -> 7155.46s]  Sees if you have an elevator in your house
[7155.46s -> 7159.82s]  If you have an elevator in your house, there's a bag of money in there somewhere that you don't care about
[7160.34s -> 7164.72s]  So why the fuck would you give a shit if you have an elevator in your house?
[7176.05s -> 7178.61s]  What about if you're disabled? Yeah. Yeah, that makes perfect sense
[7179.33s -> 7183.97s]  But I'm gonna just take a wild guess and say that this person is doing it
[7184.61s -> 7193.90s]  Because they're just they want to look at this what practical reasons is for what is this?
[7193.90s -> 7205.52s]  I mean, you cannot tell me for like some kind of excuse that like he's like a dr. Seuss fan or something like
[7206.30s -> 7221.48s]  Just looking for money. Yep, definitely gonna be a safe back here. There's absolutely gonna be a state way
[7221.48s -> 7236.94s]  That's very worth a lot of money. No safe behind the painting really? Okay, so I just destroyed this whole painting
[7236.94s -> 7247.95s]  There's just a frame here and I don't see a difference and when it was not broken elevator
[7247.95s -> 7256.64s]  No, wait bedroom. I'm in the bed. It's just I just looks like a fucking Oreo cookie. I want to bite this. Oh
[7257.66s -> 7264.93s]  Doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't look like an ice cream cake. I want to bite this ice cream cake
[7265.33s -> 7272.58s]  You know what to talk about when you bite in and it's like so cold in the middle here
[7272.74s -> 7277.78s]  It's a kind of frozen and you teeth just smudge through it really freezing cold and still I've wanted
[7278.22s -> 7285.64s]  But anyways, there's nothing under here. Wait, they might be
[7286.52s -> 7291.94s]  weird with the weird super rich people like this probably have
[7292.54s -> 7299.54s]  This prep this I told you I told you there's like fucking 30 BTC back here sleeping pills. Oh, no
[7300.38s -> 7320.15s]  Nothing. Nothing. Come on. That's like a super huge bed. What is this? Oh, I turn it off. I don't like it
[7320.67s -> 7324.16s]  expensive shoes
[7324.16s -> 7345.28s]  Behind the mirror expensive shirt. Oh, no blind blind blind. What do you mean blind?
[7345.92s -> 7357.48s]  Something expensive that I missed missed him on the shelf right next to where you smashed
[7358.12s -> 7370.68s]  What do you mean? Oh right here
[7371.88s -> 7373.86s]  He goes a wallet
[7373.86s -> 7376.30s]  The this bright flashlight was making it fucked up
[7376.30s -> 7432.59s]  All right, and then we're really then we're really gonna make this work on our favor now
[7432.59s -> 7448.72s]  He's gonna be like fucking Steve. I'm not my nice Steve. My name's like fucking Jerry. That's real
[7448.72s -> 7450.96s]  Let's really confuse the fuck out of him. What do you say?

[7645.68s -> 7708.01s]  And then we're right this yeah, yeah, what do you think about that? What's the difference the Joker does that?
[7708.01s -> 7721.06s]  Oh, and by the way and leave my calling card. Yeah, it's supposed to be the Joker. Hold on
[7721.06s -> 7750.94s]  If you're good at something never do it for free. Well, okay, let's steal some more stuff

[8212.89s -> 8221.02s]  I was gonna draw a huge line that went around the entire house and at the start it said where is your art and now
[8221.02s -> 8259.80s]  It's gonna have to be just broken at the end. Oh, there we go. He's gonna have to follow this around as they call a fucking house
[8260.04s -> 8299.62s]  Okay, where is your art? Let's say where?
[8313.09s -> 8320.80s]  Hmm, what where'd it go? What is this? Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait my tapeworm go

[8338.54s -> 8361.62s]  I spray paint the water get wrong. He's gonna backtrack. He's gonna go over here. I
[8366.94s -> 8373.12s]  Guess he wouldn't like follow this like an idiot. You would just go to where it looks it and here it is the end. Oh
[8378.14s -> 8382.48s]  And we need a message here
[8382.48s -> 8421.12s]  See I drew him a new one. This one's free. Yeah. Okay. This is car illegal. Okay

[8613.03s -> 8624.38s]  Is it water in this pool? Oh, there's no water in here doesn't need to be in the ocean
[8624.88s -> 8627.86s]  Wait is where is there is there what there is water somewhere isn't there?
[8628.10s -> 8635.94s]  There's a cool now right here. There's this pool here. I guess I could try to do that one at this one
[8635.94s -> 8647.99s]  I could just drive off. All right, let's keep this going though. I want to is that one
[8647.99s -> 8657.16s]  There's the one that's in this showroom here. That should be fine. So we're just gonna
[8659.02s -> 8685.12s]  That way I open a door straight that way right that way and now
[8685.40s -> 8692.21s]  So those two can just go get dumped and what about this one? Oh, there's one here, too. Holy shit
[8692.21s -> 8698.10s]  That's like there's like four right here. All right. Well, this one can go straight fuck the gazebo
[8698.62s -> 8702.66s]  Alright, we're gonna say there's one right there, too
[8703.16s -> 8752.52s]  Wait, can I do that? I do that. Oh, you can't oh, this has got to be way cleaner, too
[8752.52s -> 8767.84s]  It's like I got to destroy all this grass you 100% can no you can't it was patched. Oh, well, they patched it
[8768.14s -> 8770.14s]  Alright, we're gonna take care of all this grass
[8779.39s -> 8791.72s]  Or not, I need to be able to get out of this
[8791.96s -> 8803.56s]  So don't yeah, let's drive straight and then I guess I could just I could just drive this thing straight straight
[8803.56s -> 8826.01s]  It's a hot tub right here. Hold on. I have to test something. Is that hot tub? Oh, it's upstairs
[8827.49s -> 8830.64s]  Never mind
[8830.64s -> 8841.42s]  Drive up the stairs. I can't drive upstairs. It's not upstairs
[8841.94s -> 8848.61s]  Yeah, it is. That's clearly upstairs
[8849.17s -> 8857.35s]  Alright, so this one goes straight drive it straight all the way into the ocean this one
[8857.75s -> 8863.76s]  Drive it just drive it out there that one drive it out there. This is like a big jump right here
[8863.76s -> 8868.38s]  I'm just gonna fly off this and just ghost ride it off. Okay, let's ride that one drive that one
[8868.74s -> 8873.33s]  Alright, let me plan so
[8874.93s -> 8877.25s]  Ghost ride it and take this one
[8877.77s -> 8884.62s]  We'll do this one first. This one can just be driven straight. Let me see if I can just get these four
[8884.62s -> 8910.98s]  I'm not going for the fucking hundred percent. Who cares? Let me see if I can get these four. This is one raised car lift
[8917.93s -> 8938.06s]  I'm gonna go for it. Ready? One, two, three go. I don't have any tires. Okay, so
[8939.62s -> 8948.23s]  Looks like I'm gonna have to carry it. There's tires over here. Can I put them on?
[8948.23s -> 8969.87s]  I don't think I can put these on. No, you can't wait. Hold on. You can't like push it lift the car
[8970.15s -> 8991.57s]  Wait, I you can't do that. That's made up. You made that up
[8991.57s -> 9006.59s]  No, it doesn't work. I gotta carry this out with a good tractor or something
[9006.63s -> 9075.11s]  I just put a car on top of a car. I just kind of squished it a little. It almost kind of worked
[9075.11s -> 9138.68s]  I'm gonna lift it's like snow. You just got to make the tires free. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait
[9138.68s -> 9140.52s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second. Wait a second
[9140.52s -> 9148.96s]  It never said anything about the car needing to be in one piece throw this fucking thing in the ocean
[9148.96s -> 9196.01s]  It didn't say shit about that. Hold on a second. Move out of the way. It's on this fucking car now
[9196.01s -> 9205.90s]  Wait a minute walk it to the ocean. That's what I just I don't know how I fucked that up
[9205.90s -> 9218.47s]  All right, here we go. Where's the nearest ocean? I just drag it this way game over
[9218.47s -> 9246.14s]  I win imagine this worked the pond in the racetrack. Oh, holy shit. There is you fucking genius. I'm driving it
[9246.14s -> 9277.96s]  I'm driving it. I'd like everyone to apologize to me, please. He just Flintstones the car. All right now, so that's one
[9277.96s -> 9287.96s]  I just need to get two. Yeah, let's get out of here. That's that one. Now I can just go
[9288.52s -> 9296.55s]  Straight I'm gonna dump this one first. We're gonna go this one straight dump into the pond. These are all going to the pond
[9296.55s -> 9298.73s]  I'm ready save this fucking shit. Let's go
[9299.05s -> 9316.66s]  Just get out go. There we go. Ready? One, two, three
[9317.50s -> 9363.55s]  Get off move this. Why is it those shit in the way? Why did I drive backwards? I don't know
[9363.55s -> 9387.23s]  I fucked up. All right, let's do it. Just gotta get him the pond. Just two more. Here we go. It's pond
[9396.59s -> 9408.50s]  Get that pond. All right, dump it. I need another car here. I need you the car to be take me
[9408.50s -> 9420.02s]  But wait, that's okay. The ass is wrong. I gotta get another car. It's fucked up
[9420.02s -> 9425.80s]  I gotta get another car to do go that way. I fucked it up
[9425.80s -> 9438.30s]  I was supposed to go straight over the thing. Remember I was gonna fly over. All right, let me get this more
[9438.82s -> 9451.13s]  Correct. Let's put this car down here. I'm gonna jump that. I need an escape car
[9451.49s -> 9456.07s]  Once I jump that I'm gonna end up like there. It's gonna go in the ocean
[9456.79s -> 9463.12s]  Perfect opportunity. There's okay. There is a car already here. We're gonna go
[9464.38s -> 9466.06s]  Over here wait
[9466.06s -> 9486.37s]  So I can just fly over that take that car back
[9486.57s -> 9494.45s]  I'm gonna take that car back to here and I'm just gonna drive this one in the ocean and then it's and then escape
[9494.77s -> 9507.64s]  Let's see if I can do it are on truck. Oh shit. Give me that meat on bone meat on bone
[9509.72s -> 9537.80s]  Piano, what's a piano doing out here? All right, so this would be two and then we just need one more
[9537.80s -> 9547.90s]  That's it. What and anything after that is icing on the cake. Hold on if I go take this one
[9549.07s -> 9554.82s]  I'm gonna make enough room where I can just speed through that. I have my escape car
[9554.82s -> 9581.04s]  I might be looking more than one. Here's a car. There's a car. There's a car. There's a car. You see plucky
[9581.08s -> 9583.16s]  We're gonna play our favorite game
[9583.72s -> 9586.21s]  It's called there's a car
[9586.49s -> 9589.47s]  Anytime you see a car plucky you say there's a car
[9590.13s -> 9607.35s]  There's a car. There's a car. There's a car. There's a car. There's a car. Did anyone know that is that's from?
[9607.71s -> 9609.87s]  Tiny Toons how I spent my summer vacation
[9611.51s -> 9620.52s]  Nice go nice going one person. How do I fuck that up? I have no idea. I could just end this right now
[9620.64s -> 9629.44s]  All right. No, no, no, no, no. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Watch this shit. You ready?
[9629.60s -> 9645.44s]  I'm going straight this way ditch straight that way ditch. There is a car. There's a car. How do you unsubscribe?
[9646.04s -> 9652.37s]  You better not do it. You're gonna unsubscribe better not
[9653.05s -> 9670.36s]  Open open. Oh
[9670.76s -> 9678.42s]  Stupid game. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I'm good. I'm good. I'm leaving
[9679.10s -> 9693.71s]  Anymore. Nope. I'm done who watches German in 2020. I don't know man you
[9695.41s -> 9710.42s]  Coffee oh this coffee's kind of gross. Mmm. I'm now a trespasser a new tool. Nice. I this guy's love this game
[9710.42s -> 9724.42s]  I love the tools new tool who uses doors anymore
[9725.63s -> 9728.69s]  Blanks blanks can be used to build primitive for ramps
[9728.69s -> 9739.54s]  You can also attach objects with planks to lift or drag heavy items really build complex structures
[9754.88s -> 9773.61s]  That's pretty cool. That's really cool. And then I can pick it up. Okay, they can attach to walls too. Nice
[9774.25s -> 9784.61s]  It stays there. All right, that's cool. How much money do I have?
[9785.17s -> 9795.52s]  600 oh nothing nothing planks maximum length. Oh
[9796.72s -> 9807.10s]  Feel like I want maximum length and more planks. Yeah
[9809.75s -> 9818.19s]  24 planks. Hey, what about this one? I think the login device submitted to find a connection to the West Point Marina
[9818.47s -> 9820.67s]  I've been able to figure out more on BT
[9820.99s -> 9822.99s]  But Lee has a warehouse in West Point
[9823.59s -> 9827.07s]  I guess whatever fishy business he's up to the marina is not the final destination
[9827.07s -> 9830.77s]  I was thinking the boat GPS devices can give me an idea where he's moving the product
[9830.95s -> 9839.85s]  Especially if I could compare their recent destinations to the shipping log. Can you get him shoot for quantity almost always
[9840.29s -> 9851.00s]  Steal the GPS device from Lee's boat and get the log files watch the news
[9851.00s -> 9870.73s]  I keep forgetting to watch the fucking TV just spawn me in front of the TV. Okay log files in the office boat trailer
[9871.17s -> 9875.15s]  Okay
[9875.19s -> 9880.39s]  Fishing boat
[9880.39s -> 9883.03s]  secondary targets are boat and boat house
[9883.67s -> 9888.33s]  Let's go to the office and just take a little peek of what we're working with here
[9888.33s -> 9910.57s]  I got my long planks. I still have a VHS tape of how I spent my summer vacation
[9910.57s -> 9914.27s]  I remember renting that at blockbuster over and over again
[9914.59s -> 9925.19s]  And sometimes it wouldn't be in and I would be so pissed because there was only like one copy of that at blockbuster
[9925.51s -> 9927.39s]  And those you guys don't know how blockbuster worked
[9927.55s -> 9933.03s]  They had display cases and if there was a second case behind the display case
[9933.19s -> 9936.32s]  That means that that was currently in and you could rent it
[9936.36s -> 9942.80s]  so it was always so horrible when you would go into blockbuster and they would be a new game or a new movie that you want to
[9942.80s -> 9950.64s]  Watch and it'd be two or three rows of these display cases and none of them had a single secondary case behind them
[9950.64s -> 9957.42s]  It was just so defeating because then you had to rent something else and it was like I don't want to fucking rent something else
[9957.78s -> 9960.45s]  I don't want to I don't want to rent
[9961.45s -> 9963.45s]  That's the glove game 364
[9963.45s -> 9968.97s]  I've rented that like five times in different places because they didn't have like Donkey Kong
[9969.37s -> 9996.16s]  Lover waiting room. All right, I'm stealing something here. What am I stealing all the way across the whole room. What are we stealing?
[9997.68s -> 10004.98s]  Holy shit. Whoa
[10005.50s -> 10015.12s]  That's 400. What was the antique pirate dagger? Holy shit. Okay, be careful. I don't want to trigger this save this
[10015.36s -> 10026.70s]  This is gonna this is gonna trigger same technique I did last time although
[10032.32s -> 10044.18s]  Did he grab this steal the GPS out of there and then steal the GPS out of here and then fuck off
[10044.24s -> 10068.96s]  It's my escape. All right, that's gonna you know, let's just go for it. Whatever. Fuck it. Let's just write a little one little boat
[10068.96s -> 10077.08s]  This is too slow. This is really slow
[10077.60s -> 10099.02s]  Way too slow just burnt so much time fuck what no take the what the fuck are you doing?
[10099.42s -> 10111.63s]  What Wow, oh that is just not gonna happen. We're gonna plank the fuck out of this
[10111.63s -> 10131.61s]  If we can I can I I can't right?
[10132.13s -> 10143.27s]  No, I can't build a bridge
[10143.61s -> 10158.36s]  These are so slow. I need a faster boat. Okay, is it was like a speedboat? I guess I could I dump
[10158.36s -> 10161.93s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna dump that in the ocean. Yeah, let's go
[10162.45s -> 10166.10s]  Big boat is fast. Are you sure?
[10168.12s -> 10176.17s]  Okay, it is it's very fast. You have to commit to the bridge. It's not gonna work. I only have 24 planks
[10176.45s -> 10187.98s]  All right, but not hold on a second. I want to go examine this it shaves off at least 10 seconds
[10188.08s -> 10191.86s]  All right. I've got an idea
[10191.86s -> 10210.12s]  Here's my idea. I got to get over this thing. So I got to steal the GPS out of here. Why not?
[10210.76s -> 10219.34s]  Yes, okay. Why not just bring this all the way back put it in the water. Yeah, just put it in the water
[10219.62s -> 10236.31s]  You know, just have this be the last thing I do in the for the escape. That's not a bad idea
[10237.03s -> 10254.73s]  Hey now, it's the escape right there
[10255.25s -> 10268.08s]  This is a family guy joke. How wait? How is this a family guy joke?
[10268.48s -> 10300.76s]  Why did I think that backing this up was a good fucking idea? Somebody tell me there we go
[10300.76s -> 10309.48s]  All right. Now that one's ready to do the last I can do this one second to last
[10309.82s -> 10312.38s]  What the hell is going on here? I think I'm gonna build a bridge
[10312.46s -> 10327.89s]  You know what just I wonder if I can build a bridge from here to the boat cuz I need to steal this
[10328.21s -> 10361.51s]  Hey, can I just I drop this into the water? Yeah, get off. What are you attached to?
[10361.97s -> 10373.86s]  Get off stop it, please. You're making me look so bad right now. What is it still attached to?
[10374.02s -> 10411.28s]  No, I wouldn't want to pick that up. I didn't want to pay I wanted to now get this in the water
[10411.28s -> 10444.23s]  I can't drive this can't drive the boat. I can carry it though worst possible way. Really?
[10444.23s -> 10456.20s]  All right, let's drag this back to the truck. Are we gonna get this? That's good. This is optional
[10456.32s -> 10467.65s]  You're like a dog with a stick. Oh
[10469.07s -> 10493.40s]  Shit, I gotta wait. I'm not gonna waste this it fit through that at the ends. If only I was as smart as you
[10499.13s -> 10515.20s]  Yeah, I'm playing chess and you're playing I'm playing checkers you're playing chess. All right, so here is
[10515.80s -> 10520.16s]  Target number two. So there's grab that grab that
[10520.94s -> 10534.50s]  Escape what else is there? This we have to grab this take the fast boat over here. There's nothing else over here
[10534.74s -> 10565.52s]  Grab this take the fast boat here. Oh shit. Okay way to get that to drive big boat
[10565.52s -> 10573.42s]  I will just burn it all to the ground Jeremy. No, I gotta burn it all to the ground
[10574.14s -> 10578.17s]  Okay, this one is
[10579.05s -> 10581.99s]  Well, let's do a little experiment here
[10613.38s -> 10629.08s]  Now what if okay I can raise the bridge I can drive through here and just
[10629.36s -> 10643.86s]  This is this has to be the last thing I do is if I start up here at that 60 seconds go this way
[10644.86s -> 10651.97s]  I still haven't figured out what the hell has to happen here. Get that I have another boat parked right here. So we go
[10653.53s -> 10655.53s]  Get that
[10655.53s -> 10657.13s]  Get that real
[10657.13s -> 10669.26s]  Click click click click click done. Let's keep that in mind. I can drive the big boat. Well, let's let's find out
[10669.26s -> 10687.98s]  Let's take a look. What is the big boat? That's inefficient. I'm not looking for efficiency. I'm looking for completion
[10703.74s -> 10705.50s]  I
[10705.50s -> 10707.06s]  Lost the physics
[10707.06s -> 10800.88s]  I'm gonna need to hold this for me. I can drive this wait. What about secret or
[10801.40s -> 10805.26s]  $100 40. I don't know that was that the engine

[11338.88s -> 11346.61s]  There's no ranks in this game. You just have to get it done. I do see new high score of five
[11346.61s -> 11358.28s]  I feel like that's very low. I hope that's not out of a hundred we get off sloppy
[11358.28s -> 11365.20s]  This was yeah, that could have been cleaned up. Just look at how bad this is. This is terrible
[11365.32s -> 11369.14s]  Okay at this point in the line, I I took drugs
[11369.72s -> 11373.11s]  I mean it started to kick in yeah
[11373.83s -> 11389.93s]  Clearly clearly it started to really kick in about here. How much money do I have? Oh only then is when you took drugs
[11390.23s -> 11401.75s]  TV Marina and several boats were damaged yesterday as
[11402.88s -> 11404.88s]  thieves broken and got
[11405.24s -> 11407.24s]  away with expensive
[11408.49s -> 11415.50s]  GPS navigation units Harbor master Jim delish says the Marina has been
[11415.86s -> 11418.23s]  subject to a string of
[11418.83s -> 11420.31s]  vandalism and
[11420.31s -> 11432.59s]  burglary incidents lately you tool right was it pipe bombs? Oh
[11435.22s -> 11442.02s]  Oh my goodness. This is fun. Okay, I
[11442.66s -> 11454.92s]  Upgraded pipe bombs. There's no upgrades for these really really glad I spent like 500 bucks on this useless thing
[11455.84s -> 11468.30s]  Upgrade the fuel count great last rounds. I want these so bad
[11468.34s -> 11475.16s]  Yeah, 18 still need those GPS devices would be ashamed to open that demolition investigation
[11475.16s -> 11480.93s]  But wouldn't it I just do that. Thanks to take care of the GPS device
[11480.93s -> 11482.01s]  Just one problem
[11482.01s -> 11487.29s]  They seem to be of a new more secure type and I can't find out there are recent locations without the decryption key
[11487.41s -> 11496.79s]  My best bet is that Lee keeps the decryption key in his office safe, but it might also be in that production safe
[11496.79s -> 11499.99s]  I have one last favor to ask of you and I think you already know what that might be
[11500.59s -> 11505.28s]  the lifting
[11505.28s -> 11508.96s]  GPS decryption key is in Lee's safe move the safe to your escape vehicle
[11509.28s -> 11511.45s]  If possible also get
[11511.81s -> 11515.32s]  fire
[11515.32s -> 11522.36s]  Yes, my house
[11522.76s -> 11530.47s]  Right. Okay. Well run. No, I can take care of it

[11564.24s -> 11574.96s]  I'm sorry that hurt smashed my fucking hand. Okay. So now let's take a look
[11575.32s -> 11583.09s]  Hmm GPS decryption key is in Lee's safe move the safe to your escape vehicle
[11583.96s -> 11590.45s]  Possible also get the other safe and pick up all key cabinets. So we're gonna draw this safe is too heavy
[11590.45s -> 11597.62s]  We have to okay. I'm gonna pick the safe up with this claw. That's easy enough. All right office safe is right here
[11597.62s -> 11609.85s]  Let's go see you. Let's go. Take a look at the claw drop it here. Probably money up here. Oh

[11660.97s -> 11664.03s]  I could put the safe in here. I really wanted to
[11664.91s -> 11683.64s]  All right. This is kind of like the fun part of Minecraft without having to play minecraft under box
[11683.64s -> 11692.40s]  I don't have to build a house. I just can just break blocks with my
[11693.16s -> 11699.54s]  Mining pick it's like more fun. You're a griefer
[11701.17s -> 11708.92s]  Griefing simulate minecraft grief simulator. All right, what can I do with this? I feel like I can make a bridge with this
[11709.34s -> 11716.53s]  Hold on. Hold on. Let's take don't stop rushing. Just get out there and take it and just survey the area for a little bit
[11716.53s -> 11717.85s]  You're good
[11717.85s -> 11746.46s]  Must be locked. Well, and that's just too bad, but I've just done that to the lock. Yes
[11747.16s -> 11750.68s]  Well, all right, let's take a look. Let's see if any any valuables

[11880.85s -> 11897.62s]  Sick rollercoaster, dude. I'm gonna break this staircase and just get off limits. Nothing up here. Why'd you say that?
[11897.62s -> 11914.18s]  There's nothing even here. I already got it. Oh shit. I thought it like a reset 40 bucks
[11914.86s -> 11935.28s]  Capitalism trophy whatever that was nothing paper. Jam. Oh something there. What is it? There's something there. I saw it

[11948.32s -> 11958.04s]  So this is the safe we obviously have a few ways to do this. I'll break that
[11958.60s -> 11964.88s]  Okay, so I can load the safe onto the back of the I just beat the level
[11964.88s -> 12027.00s]  I just beat it. I'm gonna drop the safe out the window on to the truck. That's safe. There it is
[12027.52s -> 12038.52s]  Alright now if I can wait use the dump truck. Yeah
[12039.24s -> 12061.54s]  Yeah, but hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Okay, that looks good
[12062.02s -> 12074.18s]  I'm gonna drop it in there. Is that set up for this? That's that one. What about what's this over here?
[12074.18s -> 12091.38s]  This is another safe. All right, then we're gonna jump jump. We need to jump towards that one. All right. Um, just a key cabinet
[12091.38s -> 12092.50s]  I can steal that
[12092.50s -> 12127.73s]  Okay, let me just see if this works. This place is fucking filthy. I gotta clean the place up
[12127.73s -> 12137.96s]  There's too much debris everywhere. I have to get rid of it. Look, it's just a joke get it's getting caught on everything
[12138.28s -> 12174.03s]  What a massive cleanup job. I just gave myself. No, okay, if you hit it again, it just disintegrates. There we go
[12174.07s -> 12198.97s]  Cool. All right. We're good. Jot gun the fuck out of this right there. Okay. Let's see if this works. Holy shit. That's
[12200.33s -> 12223.69s]  400 okay, where's the escape car?
[12245.20s -> 12262.76s]  I don't even care. I'm done. I got like 800 bucks through the walls and shit that makes up for the other objectives
[12262.76s -> 12275.96s]  I didn't do minimum minimum minimum. No just for that one. I just made a thousand dollars
[12275.96s -> 12288.13s]  I have 900 bucks. What are you talking about? Lee chemicals suffered as the place still on fire another spectacular break-in last night
[12288.47s -> 12296.97s]  Where properties were damaged and the perpetrators got away with heavy security?
[12297.57s -> 12308.62s]  Equipment according to the police what is happening to look hell you need to locks for your locks now
[12308.98s -> 12320.25s]  Says CEO Lawrence Lee jr. Turn this shit off
[12320.85s -> 12327.40s]  Thanks. Now. I just need to find someone who can work a safe
[12327.40s -> 12330.44s]  I'll get back to you in a bit and let you know how it goes. Okay, hold on tools
[12330.44s -> 12336.56s]  I think I want to do the shotgun
[12336.84s -> 12346.86s]  I like this a lot and I want more damage more damage and more rounds and more rounds in the pipe on
[12350.05s -> 12353.12s]  How much damage is it though? Let's find out
[12353.76s -> 12360.70s]  Hmm. I mean, it's that much more than it was before
[12361.34s -> 12387.52s]  Bumps. Oh, yeah, let's test that I can die. All right that worked. What's next Gordon? Ooh water tower
[12387.52s -> 12392.36s]  I still don't know how but Lee found out about the cars and totally overreacted
[12392.36s -> 12398.17s]  I just saved the life of those poor cars and it goes completely mental and vandalizes my property
[12398.41s -> 12401.07s]  Do you believe that good thing? I'm properly insured
[12401.07s -> 12407.19s]  I thought about ways to get back at him and finally nailed it the iconic water tower at Lee chemicals
[12407.31s -> 12413.07s]  His grandfather built it with his bare hands and it has since become a symbol from the entire Lee family
[12413.07s -> 12419.54s]  They even use it in their logo type making that tower a little less tall would be a suitable symbol for the small man
[12419.54s -> 12428.04s]  He is hmm tower Gordon wants you to get back at Lee by making his iconic towers shorter
[12428.08s -> 12440.61s]  Remove the upper part of the tower the fire. Yeah, I didn't even look at it assumed it was there. What's all this bomb?
[12461.73s -> 12465.49s]  I have pipe bombs though. Who cares?
[12466.05s -> 12482.33s]  What do you mean do it with the water tower the tower? Yeah, watch watch this up there, right?
[12482.33s -> 12564.98s]  All right, this is gonna be fucking easy. Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's plank this up
[12564.98s -> 12620.50s]  What's the timer on this? Oh
[12621.14s -> 12633.69s]  doom eternal
[12633.69s -> 12641.51s]  No
[12641.51s -> 12668.54s]  All wasn't not falling. Why is it? Why is it? It's keeping this up? Oh, there's one P. All right, hold on ready
[12668.62s -> 12677.37s]  This is where I saved the game
[12678.17s -> 12687.90s]  inside
[12687.90s -> 12696.57s]  Like a squished inside the edge. Holy shit. Let me go. I'm gonna go to the shoot dude. Watch this. Holy shit

[12791.58s -> 12796.20s]  I'm so lazy. You know what? Just get me in the fucking side door. I don't care
[12796.20s -> 12840.39s]  Huh? So what's the problem? Why don't think I could reach there's a part above the line. Okay, hold on
[12840.39s -> 12864.48s]  So those secret hidden stuff it might be I want them. I want money man. Okay, so I'm up here. All right
[12864.54s -> 12874.90s]  It's gonna it's connected right there. It's connected right there. Fuck. It's too far away. It's hanging by thread
[12875.10s -> 12896.78s]  Bomb I don't try but I don't want to blow up the whole tower 20 bucks. Hold on
[12896.78s -> 12921.54s]  I think I just gave myself an opportunity. That's an opportunity right there. Get out of the way. Here we go
[12921.54s -> 12927.55s]  I can cut it from here. Cut it down

[16694.16s -> 16700.72s]  Gordon's account has caused us some financial strain recently and is in our interest to bring back the paintings as discreetly and swiftly as possible
[16701.24s -> 16705.38s]  According to our intelligence the paintings are hidden at the marina
[16705.38s -> 16710.71s]  I know Gordon's been working with you in the past. Maybe you can help out wait to have to bring them back
[16710.71s -> 16733.28s]  I just got rid of him a shotgun. How about I feel like I don't I'm not very good with the planks. I'm going full

[16740.71s -> 16749.56s]  This is like chaotic evil. This is like chaotic neutral. This is like chaotic good. This is lawful
[16750.30s -> 16754.14s]  Neutral. No, this is probably lawful. Yeah lawful neutral lawful evil and
[16755.66s -> 16757.70s]  true
[16757.70s -> 16765.82s]  Neutral and none of you like that at all
[16771.93s -> 16776.51s]  All right, let's bring the art back

[16790.54s -> 16792.54s]  Well, how what else am I supposed to do?
[16792.58s -> 16800.97s]  Okay, I have to get all the art back. It's definitely there's a fire alarm. That's it
[16801.33s -> 16819.15s]  Don't set off the fire alarm with this and they're not rigged for anything else. Oh look just happened lightning. Oh

[16828.73s -> 16840.66s]  Where's the first one? So don't set up the fire alarm
[16841.18s -> 16843.18s]  What if I'm out of that's out of my control?

[16879.74s -> 16889.25s]  Do you not have stairs to go into the top floor your fucking house? What were the stairs?
[16889.77s -> 16905.43s]  Alright, I got one. That wasn't even it
[16913.07s -> 16941.57s]  There it is. Okay, there is secrets up there. Hold on. I can't do this. I can't I I'm supposed to do

[17027.22s -> 17051.34s]  Yeah, it was no fire fire alert. Well, it's buried under a bunch of rubble. I can't get under there
[17062.46s -> 17096.69s]  Destroy the stairs again. Fuck. What the heck? I was this one in the back. I'm gonna chill. Okay. No
[17099.02s -> 17100.14s]  Oh

[17115.42s -> 17132.24s]  All right fires out any anything to steal not really. All right

[17454.19s -> 17455.97s]  I can walk faster.
[17455.97s -> 17460.85s]  How did I miss?
[17460.85s -> 17462.71s]  How did I miss?
[17462.71s -> 17464.55s]  That's not even possible to miss.
[17464.55s -> 17485.17s]  Sorry I pressed tab during like an exciting moment.
[17485.17s -> 17489.30s]  Okay go go go go go go hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry!
[17489.30s -> 17490.30s]  Where's the painting?
[17490.30s -> 17491.30s]  It's up there.
[17491.30s -> 17492.30s]  Alright fire alert!
[17492.30s -> 17493.60s]  Fire, there's a fire!
[17493.60s -> 17495.94s]  Fire alert!
[17495.94s -> 17498.94s]  Alert there's a fire!
[17498.94s -> 17499.94s]  I gotta get in.
[17499.94s -> 17503.64s]  Get in get in and get in and get in!
[17503.64s -> 17504.88s]  OW!
[17504.88s -> 17506.26s]  No no there's a fire in here!
[17506.26s -> 17509.76s]  It's quiet, I gotta do these planks.
[17509.76s -> 17517.13s]  Oh my god, you just gotta do it right here.
[17517.13s -> 17523.50s]  Oh!
[17523.50s -> 17524.34s]  No!
[17528.94s -> 17530.22s]  I just gotta give her the painting
[17530.22s -> 17531.78s]  and get the fuck out of here.
[17531.78s -> 17532.94s]  Give her the painting and get out.
[17532.94s -> 17535.98s]  Give her the painting.
[17535.98s -> 17537.72s]  Where's this fucking painting?
[17544.02s -> 17546.46s]  Fuck, I just reload.
[17546.46s -> 17547.94s]  Oh, I'm so pissed.
[17547.94s -> 17549.34s]  I'm so mad.
[17549.34s -> 17551.86s]  Somebody just dipped me into acid.
[17551.86s -> 17557.38s]  I just got dipped into like hot fucking...
[17557.38s -> 17559.54s]  Ah, this is so far away.
[17560.38s -> 17570.34s]  I gotta bind save to left mouse button.
[17570.34s -> 17585.58s]  I'm doing that one last.
[17585.58s -> 17587.54s]  Like, I'm not even there yet.
[17587.54s -> 17589.78s]  Like, why would you put it that crazy?
[17589.78s -> 17597.05s]  I'm not even there.
[17597.05s -> 17598.49s]  I'm not even here.
[17598.49s -> 17610.36s]  I'm not even here.
[17610.36s -> 17613.20s]  Dude, how does one get rid of this fire this quickly?
[17613.20s -> 17621.92s]  How does one do that?
[17621.92s -> 17624.28s]  Where, where's the...
[17624.28s -> 17627.45s]  Excuse me, where's the fire?
[17627.45s -> 17656.84s]  You see a fire?
[17656.84s -> 17658.52s]  Where am I going?
[17658.52s -> 17661.86s]  It's cause I fucking skipped it.
[17661.86s -> 17663.46s]  You asshole.
[17672.24s -> 17674.93s]  I have a solution.
[17674.93s -> 17695.93s]  Throw them, just throw them in the water.
[17695.93s -> 17714.09s]  I just don't feel like detaching that.
[17714.09s -> 17732.34s]  Could have just opened the front door.
[17732.34s -> 17733.18s]  Where is it?
[17733.18s -> 17738.09s]  It's the last piece.
[17738.09s -> 17743.38s]  All right, yes.
[17743.38s -> 17744.66s]  Last one.
[17744.66s -> 17746.02s]  It's one, that last one,
[17746.02s -> 17748.71s]  I gotta go all the way down here.
[17748.71s -> 17751.28s]  Save this shit.
[17751.28s -> 17752.52s]  What about goodies?
[17752.52s -> 17755.36s]  They could be goodies.
[17755.36s -> 17760.88s]  And I'm gonna leave without at least one or two goodies.
[17760.88s -> 17767.78s]  In the attic.
[17767.78s -> 17770.94s]  Yup, 240 bucks.
[17770.94s -> 17772.22s]  Antique fucking coins.
[17782.50s -> 17783.58s]  What was I, what am I doing?
[17783.58s -> 17789.86s]  Why did I just do that?
[17789.86s -> 17792.34s]  Okay, we're ready to drive.
[17792.34s -> 17794.54s]  This car can't drive.
[17794.54s -> 17795.38s]  Oh, I'm just taking the boat
[17795.38s -> 17796.22s]  around the whole damn place.
[17796.22s -> 17805.01s]  I don't care.
[17805.01s -> 17806.89s]  What are your thoughts of collabing with...
[17808.65s -> 17814.05s]  I don't know who that is.
[17814.05s -> 17819.81s]  Is that place on fire?
[17819.81s -> 17823.46s]  The building's on fire, isn't it?
[17823.46s -> 17825.10s]  Just don't, who cares?
[17825.10s -> 17827.26s]  I should have been paying attention to the road
[17827.26s -> 17828.82s]  that's made out of liquid.
[17828.82s -> 17838.02s]  Why did I do that?
[17838.02s -> 17839.18s]  You just ignored a raid?
[17839.18s -> 17840.24s]  I got raided?
[17840.24s -> 17841.26s]  Oh shit, did I get raided?
[17841.26s -> 17846.47s]  Who raided?
[17846.47s -> 17848.42s]  Did I get raided?
[17848.42s -> 17865.03s]  Who came in?
[17865.03s -> 17868.82s]  I need to get up on top.
[17868.82s -> 17876.23s]  Oh my fucking God, please don't do this to me.
[17876.23s -> 17877.07s]  Where's the rest of it?
[17877.07s -> 17895.18s]  Oh shit, this is where planks have to make some sense.
[17895.18s -> 17898.17s]  Stop spreading.
[17898.17s -> 17901.05s]  Stop spreading, please.
[17901.05s -> 17904.13s]  Why is it spreading so much?
[17904.13s -> 17930.44s]  I just told it not to do that.
[17930.44s -> 17945.18s]  Sorry, to put the house fire out, I had to shoot it.
[17945.18s -> 17946.74s]  It's out, we're good.
[17946.74s -> 17971.05s]  Save the game.
[17985.14s -> 17998.06s]  It's okay, it's just this bottom row of teeth.
[17998.42s -> 18016.21s]  All right, sayonara, fog.
[18016.21s -> 18020.28s]  That one was fun, I like that one.
[18020.28s -> 18024.34s]  I like the idea of needing to use your tools
[18024.34s -> 18028.30s]  besides just steal something that's attached to an alarm.
[18028.30s -> 18032.55s]  A new tool, by the way, which those are fun too though.
[18032.55s -> 18038.05s]  What's the new tool?
[18038.05s -> 18043.10s]  Another gun?
[18043.10s -> 18056.21s]  Why would I care about gun when I have shotgun?
[18056.21s -> 18064.43s]  It's more accurate.
[18064.43s -> 18078.03s]  Should I do range?
[18078.03s -> 18080.26s]  Yeah, shotgun, I like the shotgun.
[18080.26s -> 18083.60s]  Let's max this out.
[18083.60s -> 18101.98s]  TV, I did this.
[18101.98s -> 18103.95s]  No more TV.
[18103.95s -> 18114.28s]  It's time for you to go to bed.
[18114.28s -> 18116.46s]  It sounds horrible.
[18116.50s -> 18118.03s]  You feel like this is gonna pop?
[18118.03s -> 18118.87s]  It sounds horrible.
[18118.87s -> 18144.75s]  This is like a bee's nest.
[18144.75s -> 18157.78s]  It's growing.
[18157.78s -> 18159.98s]  It's a silent hill enemy.
[18159.98s -> 18166.03s]  I killed it, don't worry.
[18166.03s -> 18167.27s]  Hey, nice job with the paintings.
[18167.27s -> 18168.55s]  A little charred here and there,
[18168.55s -> 18170.67s]  so I'll have to find someone to retouch them a bit
[18170.67s -> 18171.63s]  before they return to Gordon.
[18171.63s -> 18175.74s]  He won't know the difference.
[18175.74s -> 18179.34s]  Now, Gordon has an insurance problem.
[18179.34s -> 18183.57s]  Not only did Lee steal some of our most beloved paintings,
[18183.57s -> 18185.45s]  but the insurance company is causing me headaches too.
[18185.45s -> 18187.32s]  I'm a premium customer.
[18187.32s -> 18190.06s]  I still haven't seen any money for those paintings.
[18190.06s -> 18191.73s]  I'll deal with Lee later.
[18191.73s -> 18193.37s]  But right now I need to take that insurance payout
[18193.45s -> 18194.99s]  in my own hands.
[18194.99s -> 18196.95s]  I don't have a personal grudge with anyone at the company,
[18196.95s -> 18199.61s]  so I'd like to just poke them a bit where it hurts.
[18199.61s -> 18202.31s]  Any respected company the most, their bank account.
[18202.31s -> 18205.01s]  I have a top notch policy of my cars,
[18205.01s -> 18207.45s]  so if some of this were to be stolen,
[18207.45s -> 18209.82s]  they'd need to cough it up.
[18209.82s -> 18211.42s]  I'll hook up a few cars to the alarm system
[18211.42s -> 18212.34s]  to make it look legit.
[18212.34s -> 18213.42s]  Please be gentle.
[18213.42s -> 18218.82s]  Help Gordon steal at least three of his own cars
[18218.82s -> 18220.38s]  to help him with the insurance payout.
[18220.38s -> 18227.83s]  I feel like we just did this one.
[18227.83s -> 18229.70s]  We did it for the other guy,
[18229.70s -> 18233.26s]  but it's in the daytime this time.
[18233.26s -> 18243.45s]  They steal three cars.
[18243.57s -> 18245.49s]  Steal, not drown.
[18245.49s -> 18258.60s]  Oh.
[18258.60s -> 18262.04s]  What are the go-kart track?
[18262.04s -> 18264.40s]  We'll in a minute.
[18264.40s -> 18278.99s]  This car has some pep to it.
[18278.99s -> 18286.74s]  Nice.
[18286.74s -> 18295.30s]  Ooh, welcome to Mario Kart.
[18295.30s -> 18297.98s]  That was super low effort and very low energy.
[18299.02s -> 18302.66s]  I could have done, welcome to Mario Kart.
[18302.66s -> 18303.82s]  Select your player.
[18316.63s -> 18328.63s]  60 seconds.
[18328.63s -> 18329.83s]  How the fuck do you do this one?
[18329.83s -> 18332.09s]  Is it already on fire?
[18332.09s -> 18342.61s]  Restart this.
[18343.85s -> 18345.25s]  No, I can't drive this around.
[18345.25s -> 18346.09s]  Sorry.
[18346.09s -> 18353.74s]  So how am I supposed to do this?
[18353.74s -> 18356.98s]  This is wired.
[18356.98s -> 18361.86s]  This is wired.
[18361.86s -> 18362.70s]  They're all wired.
[18362.70s -> 18364.78s]  So I have to drive them back here
[18364.78s -> 18372.31s]  and then is there any other cars that are on the map?
[18372.31s -> 18380.30s]  I guess I could leave them around.
[18380.30s -> 18384.39s]  Take a look.
[18384.39s -> 18386.58s]  I could play, okay.
[18386.58s -> 18389.15s]  I guess the idea is this.
[18389.15s -> 18394.14s]  I just have a bunch of spare cars here.
[18394.14s -> 18394.98s]  You know what I mean?
[18394.98s -> 18396.26s]  Like, so I drive that one up here.
[18396.26s -> 18397.70s]  Take that car to the next one.
[18397.70s -> 18399.42s]  Take this car back here.
[18399.42s -> 18400.26s]  Mr. Raid?
[18400.26s -> 18403.26s]  Who raided?
[18409.29s -> 18416.45s]  Raid Raid?
[18416.45s -> 18422.35s]  Oh, this one's a prized position too, isn't it?
[18422.35s -> 18434.62s]  All right, hold on.
[18434.62s -> 18446.24s]  I'm moving around so much.
[18446.24s -> 18447.08s]  This is gonna fuck me up.
[18447.08s -> 18452.78s]  I know it.
[18452.78s -> 18455.41s]  This one, we got one here.
[18455.41s -> 18456.25s]  I'm not gonna drive away.
[18456.25s -> 18468.86s]  I'm just gonna get it in the right spot.
[18468.86s -> 18470.90s]  Come on, wait, wait, can I?
[18470.90s -> 18471.74s]  Save it here.
[18471.74s -> 18477.86s]  Hold on.
[18477.86s -> 18487.64s]  How far does the tether go?
[18487.64s -> 18488.79s]  Raid song.
[18488.79s -> 18489.63s]  Thank you for the raid.
[18489.63s -> 18498.98s]  Thank you for the raid.
[18498.98s -> 18500.26s]  Yay, it's okay.
[18500.26s -> 18505.74s]  All right, perfect.
[18505.74s -> 18509.25s]  All right, keep that here.
[18509.25s -> 18511.99s]  Keep going.
[18511.99s -> 18515.18s]  Thanks.
[18515.18s -> 18516.33s]  That one's this one.
[18516.33s -> 18517.17s]  This one's that way.
[18517.17s -> 18518.01s]  This one's this way, that way.
[18518.01s -> 18518.85s]  That one's this way.
[18520.82s -> 18524.41s]  Take this shit out of the way so I can move this.
[18524.41s -> 18534.44s]  All right, they connected.
[18534.44s -> 18539.68s]  Drive that one down here through the, okay.
[18541.31s -> 18545.78s]  All right, here's the deal.
[18545.78s -> 18549.90s]  You start, drive this one, drive this one.
[18549.90s -> 18552.70s]  Up, ding, drive this one.
[18552.70s -> 18555.88s]  Down, ding, we need another car.
[18555.88s -> 18559.32s]  I need a second dummy car there.
[18559.32s -> 18570.46s]  Buy me a car.
[18570.54s -> 18576.38s]  And a new viewer, can I get a song?
[18576.38s -> 18580.33s]  Hey Jack mate, welcome to the stream.
[18580.33s -> 18581.77s]  I love.
[18581.77s -> 18583.49s]  Don't say that, don't say that.
[18583.49s -> 18584.69s]  Don't say that.
[18584.69s -> 18586.41s]  Do not say that.
[18586.41s -> 18592.05s]  Not that part.
[18592.05s -> 18601.58s]  I need a second car.
[18601.58s -> 18603.18s]  You don't love us?
[18608.22s -> 18609.48s]  What are you talking about?
[18609.48s -> 18610.80s]  What was I doing?
[18610.80s -> 18621.33s]  Oh, I'm kidding, relax everybody.
[18621.33s -> 18624.29s]  I'm kidding.
[18624.29s -> 18626.53s]  It's a joke, we're joking around today.
[18626.53s -> 18637.95s]  It's a joke stream.
[18637.95s -> 18641.50s]  I lost a fucking tire, I lost a tire.
[18641.50s -> 18648.45s]  I lost a tire, is that gonna be bad?
[18648.45s -> 18649.41s]  I think that's gonna be bad,
[18649.41s -> 18651.65s]  but I might still be able to get there.
[18651.65s -> 18661.94s]  All right, I need another car.
[18661.94s -> 18682.53s]  Ah, there's a car.
[18682.53s -> 18697.91s]  Ooh, I might be able to actually carry this.
[18697.91s -> 18720.49s]  I think I can, yeah, I can carry this.
[18720.49s -> 18752.50s]  Save it, I will, shit.
[18752.50s -> 18782.14s]  Scoop it up like a fucking pancake, easy.
[18782.14s -> 18798.51s]  No, what?
[18798.51s -> 18824.03s]  Get on here.
[18824.03s -> 18848.67s]  Okay, success.
[18848.67s -> 18854.19s]  There's no timer, right?
[18854.19s -> 18861.00s]  What if I just deliver this?
[18861.00s -> 18864.96s]  Oh shit, okay, thank God I saved it.
[18864.96s -> 18872.42s]  Why did it explode?
[18872.42s -> 18874.38s]  Why did it explode?
[18874.38s -> 18875.74s]  It was ready to go.
[18875.74s -> 18876.58s]  I didn't do anything.
[18876.58s -> 18878.82s]  That was, that would've taken anything.
[18878.82s -> 18886.04s]  Okay, well now that I know that, I gotta be careful.
[18886.04s -> 18892.34s]  It's rigged to explode.
[18892.34s -> 18902.79s]  No, fucking idiots, don't.
[18902.79s -> 18903.95s]  I'm just, I don't wanna be in the,
[18903.95s -> 18923.19s]  when you touch the circle, just leave it?
[18923.19s -> 18925.59s]  No, but hold on, but look where it is.
[18925.59s -> 18927.71s]  You know for a fact I'm gonna speed up here with a car
[18927.71s -> 18929.35s]  with five seconds left and I'm gonna crash
[18929.35s -> 18932.18s]  and this is just gonna explode.
[18932.18s -> 18967.02s]  I'm trying to get it on the grass.
[18967.02s -> 19000.56s]  There, okay.
[19000.56s -> 19022.34s]  Don't explode, oh, let go, please.
[19022.34s -> 19026.22s]  I know everyone's freaking out.
[19026.22s -> 19031.46s]  I know, I know, just give me a second.
[19031.46s -> 19039.64s]  Okay, okay, it's ready, it's ready.
[19039.64s -> 19042.66s]  Those who have, I want this back.
[19053.30s -> 19056.09s]  Okay, it was ready before?
[19056.09s -> 19058.17s]  No, I want this back.
[19060.04s -> 19066.73s]  I wanna see if I can do that to any other car.
[19066.73s -> 19068.01s]  Boom, right here.
[19068.01s -> 19077.26s]  I'm gonna get this one too.
[19077.26s -> 19086.24s]  We're hooked up to walls?
[19086.24s -> 19088.56s]  You only need three, yeah, but what am I,
[19088.56s -> 19090.60s]  just gonna do the minimum every time I do a mission?
[19090.60s -> 19094.94s]  No, I wanna at least get one, good one.
[19094.94s -> 19095.78s]  All right, what am I gonna try?
[19095.78s -> 19103.10s]  I wanna try, I wanna get this guy over here.
[19103.10s -> 19107.18s]  Oh, minimum, minimum, minimum.
[19107.18s -> 19111.96s]  That's from a video from like 2012, by the way.
[19111.96s -> 19114.96s]  On Star's channel, we played a game called Minimum
[19115.00s -> 19133.70s]  and I don't know, we just played new games sometimes.
[19133.70s -> 19140.94s]  All right, that just looks fun.
[19140.94s -> 19159.82s]  All right, let's take, let's pick up the whole thing.
[19159.82s -> 19162.18s]  All right, this is attached to,
[19162.18s -> 19178.94s]  I have to attach that to something, to a crane.
[19178.94s -> 19185.00s]  First time I've used a crane the whole game.
[19185.00s -> 19187.99s]  Almost happened, almost.
[19187.99s -> 19190.94s]  You were close to being able to write Omega Low.
[19190.94s -> 19208.18s]  Almost, it's close.
[19208.18s -> 19243.32s]  How am I gonna do this?
[19243.32s -> 19248.61s]  How do I extend the crane?
[19248.61s -> 19254.14s]  I never did this before.
[19254.14s -> 19273.18s]  Arm, hook, arm?
[19273.18s -> 19288.48s]  Shit, is that gonna work?
[19288.48s -> 19289.68s]  What's going on?
[19289.68s -> 19303.10s]  What is going on?
[19303.10s -> 19308.74s]  Kanye in chat, Kanye is not in the chat, man.
[19308.74s -> 19314.72s]  Okay, I got it.
[19314.72s -> 19317.08s]  Slow down, slow down, slow it down.
[19317.08s -> 19334.85s]  I need to make some, hold on.
[19334.85s -> 19336.69s]  Hey, the device, this is the device,
[19336.69s -> 19342.48s]  but this can't fall off.
[19342.48s -> 19348.03s]  How do I get this off without doing that?
[19348.03s -> 19349.31s]  Berman Supreme is in chat.
[19349.31s -> 19354.46s]  You know, I probably would be like more excited about that.
[19354.46s -> 19355.74s]  It's like that was the boot on his head
[19355.74s -> 19361.20s]  and always runs for president in like New Hampshire, right?
[19361.20s -> 19362.97s]  Okay, we're gonna pull this.
[19365.00s -> 19365.84s]  You know, it's just like, fuck it,
[19365.84s -> 19393.11s]  let's just pull it off and see what happens.
[19393.11s -> 19397.13s]  Easy, which way do I go?
[19397.13s -> 19399.37s]  All right, I gotta go back that way, so we're gonna,
[19399.37s -> 19401.85s]  okay, this is that, what happened?
[19401.85s -> 19403.05s]  What?
[19403.05s -> 19406.10s]  Why'd I fall over?
[19406.10s -> 19424.41s]  Fuck, there are no raids right now.
[19424.41s -> 19447.45s]  I wanna go on this road, this is the safest road.
[19447.45s -> 19451.04s]  I'll win, raid, here comes a raid.
[19451.04s -> 19454.12s]  Raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid.
[19454.12s -> 19455.96s]  Can you believe it, can you believe it?
[19455.96s -> 19456.80s]  Can you believe it, there's a raid,
[19456.80s -> 19458.63s]  can you believe it, there's a raid,
[19458.63s -> 19461.29s]  can you believe it, there's a raid.
[19461.29s -> 19463.09s]  Why do you guys like pretending there are raids recently?
[19463.09s -> 19469.64s]  I've noticed that.
[19469.64s -> 19484.22s]  Come on, down here, get down here.
[19484.22s -> 19497.04s]  I don't think I can even do this.
[19497.04s -> 19501.95s]  How did I fuck this up?
[19501.95s -> 19504.82s]  Don't hook the plank.
[19504.82s -> 19506.66s]  Oh wait, I can get, yeah, I can get rid of this shit now.
[19506.66s -> 19512.90s]  I don't even need this anymore.
[19512.90s -> 19526.75s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[19526.75s -> 19556.98s]  Perfect, that's better, all right, let's go.
[19556.98s -> 19561.18s]  Hook both of them?
[19561.18s -> 19565.19s]  Can I hook both ends?
[19565.19s -> 19570.83s]  I can't, can I even do that?
[19570.83s -> 19582.70s]  I don't think I can do that.
[19582.70s -> 19589.75s]  I mean, like that?
[19589.75s -> 19612.88s]  All right, that worked, yeah, that worked.
[19612.88s -> 19623.69s]  Slow down, slow, slow, slow, slow, I'm good.
[19623.69s -> 19628.21s]  Oh, that's gonna cost a little bit of money to fix that.
[19628.21s -> 19630.05s]  Get off of me.
[19633.77s -> 19641.22s]  Get the fuck off of me.
[19641.22s -> 19646.27s]  You dick, look what you did.
[19646.27s -> 19666.66s]  I would just wrap her on.
[19666.66s -> 19669.36s]  Gary Busey raid.
[19669.36s -> 19671.08s]  What's up, Gary?
[19671.08s -> 19680.93s]  Thanks for the raid, man.
[19680.93s -> 19683.75s]  Everyone didn't think I was gonna do this.
[19683.75s -> 19691.63s]  Look at that, just being shown up.
[19691.63s -> 19692.83s]  Bill Murray just came in with a raid.
[19692.83s -> 19697.54s]  Bill, what's up, Bill?
[19697.54s -> 19700.77s]  What was Bill Murray streaming today?
[19700.77s -> 19703.98s]  Amnesia, oh, that's cool.
[19703.98s -> 19705.34s]  You like it, is it any fun?
[19705.34s -> 19718.18s]  Well, I hope you had a good stream, Bill.
[19718.18s -> 19736.90s]  All right, I'm ready, I'm ready to get four.
[19736.90s -> 19743.37s]  I need to turn it around a little.
[19743.37s -> 19745.08s]  That's fine, that's okay.
[19745.08s -> 19748.25s]  Wait, look forward a little bit.
[19748.25s -> 19749.69s]  All right, right there, save it.
[19749.69s -> 19752.33s]  All right, I got one, two, let's get four cars right now.
[19752.33s -> 19753.49s]  Let's go.
[19753.49s -> 19757.26s]  Here we go, ready?
[19757.26s -> 19762.71s]  I'm gonna get this one.
[19762.71s -> 19765.39s]  I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get them all, I'm gonna get them.
[19765.39s -> 19766.47s]  All right, ready?
[19766.47s -> 19770.10s]  These two right here.
[19770.10s -> 19781.61s]  He's still playing this, yeah, man.
[19781.61s -> 19814.30s]  One, two, three, go.
[19814.30s -> 19833.10s]  Look at how much time I have.
[19833.10s -> 19834.44s]  Shit.
[19834.44s -> 19836.12s]  All right, I got four.
[19836.12s -> 19838.54s]  I could have maybe gotten five.
[19838.54s -> 19846.94s]  I have to leave.
[19846.94s -> 19852.75s]  Sick.
[19852.75s -> 19854.91s]  I'm the developer.
[19854.91s -> 19856.19s]  Hi, I'm the developer of this game.
[19856.19s -> 19857.67s]  I'm very happy to see you enjoying Teardown.
[19857.67s -> 19858.87s]  It's my passion project,
[19858.87s -> 19861.51s]  which I worked hard on for the last year or so.
[19861.51s -> 19863.11s]  Want you to know that we left a little Easter egg
[19863.11s -> 19866.23s]  specifically for you under the furnace in the base.
[19866.23s -> 19869.76s]  Check it out.
[19869.76s -> 19871.04s]  No, you didn't.
[19871.04s -> 19877.58s]  Not at the real depth.
[19877.58s -> 19881.41s]  Furnace under the base?
[19881.41s -> 19882.77s]  Let's go check it out.
[19882.77s -> 19891.46s]  What if it's not a lie?
[19891.46s -> 19893.90s]  That's what your laundry machine looks like inside.
[19900.74s -> 19925.87s]  Okay, under the furnace.
[19925.87s -> 19934.07s]  Is this actual, wait, is this real?
[19934.07s -> 19943.72s]  This is not just some elaborate debate?
[19943.72s -> 19945.61s]  Banana.
[19945.65s -> 19947.57s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[19947.57s -> 19949.93s]  Cause we're the banana bros.
[19949.93s -> 19953.84s]  Are you kidding me?
[19955.24s -> 19957.00s]  That's unbelievable.
[19957.00s -> 19961.48s]  I call you guys like the banana bros.
[19961.48s -> 19962.56s]  I'm always eating bananas.
[19962.56s -> 19963.52s]  I'm always talking about bananas.
[19963.52s -> 19964.64s]  I'm always showing bananas.
[19964.64s -> 19966.76s]  I did a banana costume last year.
[19966.76s -> 19970.07s]  That's unbelievable.
[19970.07s -> 19974.28s]  Have we talked about banana splits?
[19974.28s -> 19975.24s]  Every time there's a new sub,
[19975.24s -> 19978.44s]  I peel a banana and I fucking go,
[19978.44s -> 19980.84s]  mmm, banana bros.
[19980.84s -> 19982.92s]  That's crazy that you put that in.
[19982.92s -> 19984.00s]  Thanks, dude.
[19988.12s -> 19988.96s]  It's a great game.
[19988.96s -> 19989.80s]  It's a really good game.
[19989.80s -> 19990.94s]  It's really fun.
[19990.94s -> 19993.51s]  Thanks for the shout out, dude, seriously.
[19993.51s -> 20000.80s]  How do I get out?
[20000.80s -> 20001.76s]  Oh shit, it's obsidian.
[20001.76s -> 20012.28s]  I can't leave.
[20012.28s -> 20027.98s]  Oh, whatever it is.
[20027.98s -> 20030.85s]  Thanks for the Easter egg, man.
[20030.85s -> 20035.86s]  And hey, I see that you're not subbed.
[20035.86s -> 20047.88s]  I mean, we gotta get you in the banana bros.
[20047.88s -> 20049.66s]  It's me, the depth.
[20049.66s -> 20051.94s]  What an elaborate thing that that person just did
[20051.94s -> 20055.82s]  to tell me to go into the furnace to get $600
[20055.82s -> 20059.54s]  for the hidden money.
[20059.54s -> 20060.38s]  You could have just said,
[20060.74s -> 20062.14s]  check under the furnace, there's money.
[20062.14s -> 20063.69s]  There's a banana for money.
[20063.69s -> 20068.52s]  No, pretend Easter egg.
[20068.52s -> 20081.28s]  Me, playing to my ego.
[20081.28s -> 20083.35s]  I got two more.
[20083.35s -> 20084.19s]  Guess what?
[20084.19s -> 20085.19s]  I managed to decrypt the GPS locations
[20085.19s -> 20088.03s]  and appointed me to Hollow Rock Island,
[20088.03s -> 20089.27s]  an old fish processing plant
[20089.27s -> 20092.04s]  now making some kind of energy drink.
[20092.04s -> 20095.08s]  BT is short for blue tide.
[20095.08s -> 20096.00s]  Why didn't I think of that before?
[20096.00s -> 20097.08s]  My daughter's totally addicted
[20097.08s -> 20103.53s]  to that disgusting sugary slug.
[20103.53s -> 20104.53s]  I'm drinking water, by the way.
[20104.53s -> 20105.37s]  I'm here right now.
[20105.37s -> 20107.94s]  It's a bit worn down, but pretty.
[20107.94s -> 20110.49s]  I need to find out where the Lee payments go.
[20110.49s -> 20116.27s]  Have a look at the blue tide computers for this one.
[20116.27s -> 20118.15s]  I just got this awesome idea for humiliating Gordon.
[20118.15s -> 20120.59s]  You know that ridiculous undersized racetrack
[20120.59s -> 20123.84s]  he keeps in his backyard to pretend to be a race driver?
[20123.84s -> 20125.04s]  Wouldn't it be funny if he came home
[20125.04s -> 20126.84s]  to a new track record on that display?
[20126.84s -> 20129.11s]  You're a decent driver.
[20129.11s -> 20131.45s]  By the way, those paintings you helped me with earlier,
[20131.45s -> 20132.77s]  they didn't make it through the thunderstorm,
[20132.77s -> 20133.69s]  burned up every single one.
[20133.69s -> 20136.74s]  What are the odds?
[20136.74s -> 20139.58s]  I gotta do the racetrack?
[20139.58s -> 20141.78s]  Help Lee annoy Gordon by beating the track record
[20141.78s -> 20142.94s]  on his private racetrack.
[20142.94s -> 20155.05s]  Oh, let's do this one.
[20155.05s -> 20156.46s]  We just got a new sub?
[20156.46s -> 20161.57s]  Oh, potassium power.
[20161.57s -> 20163.33s]  Can I see some potassium power emotes
[20163.33s -> 20165.85s]  in the chat, please, guys?
[20165.85s -> 20168.97s]  Power, power, power.
[20168.97s -> 20177.72s]  I love that word.
[20177.72s -> 20179.32s]  Finish lap in 25 seconds.
[20179.32s -> 20182.14s]  Finish lap in 20 seconds.
[20182.14s -> 20189.30s]  I get to choose what car I can use.
[20189.30s -> 20193.70s]  Total corruption, total power.
[20193.70s -> 20198.14s]  Total corruption.
[20198.14s -> 20200.33s]  Sing the banana song.
[20200.33s -> 20202.01s]  Yummy, delicious banana.
[20202.01s -> 20203.45s]  I can't wait to eat.
[20203.45s -> 20206.70s]  Okay, where do I find a car?
[20206.70s -> 20211.62s]  I just love delicious banana.
[20211.62s -> 20216.43s]  Do I do it with like the Winnebago?
[20216.43s -> 20218.15s]  What a dog shit stream that would be, seriously.
[20218.31s -> 20221.59s]  If I did that, if that was my thing,
[20221.59s -> 20223.71s]  we were like the banana bros?
[20223.71s -> 20224.55s]  For what?
[20224.55s -> 20226.83s]  That's what my entire channel identity is around.
[20226.83s -> 20228.15s]  I like bananas.
[20228.15s -> 20233.71s]  What a stupid persona that would be.
[20233.71s -> 20234.55s]  We got a new sub.
[20234.55s -> 20238.38s]  I love to eat bananas.
[20238.38s -> 20244.26s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[20244.26s -> 20245.74s]  Like a banana?
[20245.74s -> 20247.14s]  All right, how do I start?
[20247.14s -> 20252.77s]  Go, start the race.
[20252.77s -> 20274.34s]  Oh, start the race.
[20274.34s -> 20278.95s]  What's your fruit sona?
[20278.95s -> 20280.35s]  What does it say?
[20286.94s -> 20295.50s]  Um, how do I go?
[20295.50s -> 20298.54s]  Oh, get ready.
[20298.54s -> 20300.50s]  Two, one, go.
[20304.53s -> 20305.37s]  Oh, yeah.
[20321.66s -> 20327.55s]  Did I win?
[20327.55s -> 20336.37s]  Or did I just cheat?
[20336.37s -> 20339.02s]  You're too slow.
[20339.02s -> 20340.74s]  I was.
[20340.74s -> 20341.58s]  All right, no more.
[20341.58s -> 20344.81s]  I'm just gonna do like fucking noises.
[20344.81s -> 20347.72s]  Ah, here we go.
[20347.72s -> 20357.33s]  Take the fast car.
[20357.33s -> 20369.01s]  Take the other fast car.
[20369.01s -> 20370.61s]  Yeah, this thing is blazing.
[20374.10s -> 20375.90s]  I'm gonna smash this dude's record.
[20375.90s -> 20376.74s]  Here we go.
[20376.74s -> 20382.91s]  Ready, one, two.
[20382.91s -> 20384.75s]  Oh, I can't move until it.
[20384.75s -> 20393.56s]  Well, let me get it right on the line.
[20393.56s -> 20394.60s]  Car's way too fast.
[20399.78s -> 20400.94s]  I should have saved it.
[20400.94s -> 20404.82s]  Why did I not?
[20404.82s -> 20406.66s]  I should have saved it.
[20406.66s -> 20410.11s]  Why did I not save it?
[20410.11s -> 20412.52s]  Why did you not save it?
[20412.52s -> 20415.04s]  Is there a reason we need to attack
[20415.04s -> 20419.31s]  this coronavirus head on?
[20419.31s -> 20426.02s]  How do I?
[20426.02s -> 20429.90s]  Ernie, that's Boris Johnson, dude.
[20429.90s -> 20446.65s]  What are you talking about?
[20447.17s -> 20448.37s]  Ernie, I'm home.
[20448.37s -> 20450.33s]  Ernie, I'm gone.
[20450.33s -> 20456.18s]  Oh, I didn't get to do the funny thing.
[20456.18s -> 20459.89s]  Where's this cool car?
[20459.89s -> 20461.25s]  I'm lost.
[20461.25s -> 20477.56s]  Oh, it's over there.
[20477.56s -> 20479.40s]  Remember, just clear a path so you can cheat.
[20479.40s -> 20481.43s]  No, I wanna do it for real.
[20481.43s -> 20483.58s]  You know why I wanna do it for real?
[20483.58s -> 20487.26s]  Because the last time I had to do a race,
[20487.26s -> 20489.94s]  I just made it easy.
[20489.94s -> 20490.78s]  I didn't do it.
[20490.78s -> 20493.26s]  I chickened out and I skipped it.
[20493.26s -> 20506.82s]  I'm not skipping it this time.
[20506.82s -> 20509.48s]  Here we go.
[20509.48s -> 20513.06s]  How far away can I be?
[20514.02s -> 20518.17s]  Get ready.
[20518.17s -> 20535.95s]  Damn it, it knows if you cheat.
[20535.95s -> 20536.79s]  Let's go.
[20536.79s -> 20558.54s]  Boo.
[20558.54s -> 20559.38s]  No.
[20564.10s -> 20565.02s]  Game sucks.
[20565.02s -> 20565.98s]  Game sucks.
[20565.98s -> 20574.92s]  Game's not good.
[20574.92s -> 20579.70s]  Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready.
[20579.70s -> 20582.90s]  Yup.
[20582.90s -> 20584.92s]  Did I forget to turn the car?
[20584.92s -> 20593.23s]  I was so happy about doing that.
[20593.23s -> 20596.19s]  Hey, dude, I've been a viewer for over six years,
[20596.19s -> 20597.03s]  but I've always wondered,
[20597.03s -> 20598.91s]  what is that liquid you inject yourself
[20598.91s -> 20601.61s]  in the pre-stream video?
[20601.61s -> 20602.45s]  As a diabetic myself,
[20602.45s -> 20604.61s]  I can really relate to having to inject insulin.
[20604.61s -> 20608.70s]  What?
[20608.82s -> 20617.70s]  What are you talking about?
[20617.70s -> 20619.38s]  That was a mega drift.
[20619.38s -> 20622.54s]  Too much drift.
[20622.54s -> 20626.62s]  Too much drift.
[20626.62s -> 20628.92s]  Missed the punch line.
[20628.92s -> 20631.64s]  I've never seen insulin that was disgustingly brown
[20631.64s -> 20633.00s]  like that, thanks for the laughs.
[20633.00s -> 20635.21s]  I don't get it.
[20635.21s -> 20637.85s]  I don't inject anything into my body on stream.
[20637.85s -> 20638.69s]  What?
[20638.69s -> 20640.25s]  Wait, here it comes.
[20640.25s -> 20641.09s]  Eric, is this Tom?
[20641.09s -> 20643.17s]  No, I thought that, no, it was on the way.
[20674.05s -> 20674.89s]  Pfft.
[20675.09s -> 20675.93s]  Ha ha ha.
[20678.49s -> 20680.29s]  Stop, I'm not drifting.
[20680.29s -> 20685.88s]  It's just the game is hard to control.
[20685.88s -> 20687.00s]  I'm not, I'm not drifting.
[20687.00s -> 20702.67s]  The car's just incredibly fast and it's a slick crack.
[20702.67s -> 20711.34s]  It's slick.
[20711.34s -> 20713.14s]  I was here, I was here.
[20713.14s -> 20733.73s]  Fuck, I didn't do it.
[20733.73s -> 20744.82s]  Get back on the track.
[20744.82s -> 20748.89s]  Oh, it's too much drift.
[20748.89s -> 20752.38s]  Don't spin out.
[20752.38s -> 20755.94s]  Don't, don't, that person is gone.
[20759.60s -> 20768.12s]  Guys, yeah.
[20768.12s -> 20769.36s]  That drift was perfect.
[20769.36s -> 20785.68s]  Yeah, but look, it's hard.
[20785.68s -> 20787.39s]  Use a controller.
[20787.39s -> 20818.66s]  No, I'm a PC gamer.
[20818.66s -> 20822.37s]  Pfft.
[20822.37s -> 20828.11s]  Holy shit, that's a lot of community subs.
[20828.11s -> 20830.66s]  Shady Seas, thanks for the 20 subs.
[20830.66s -> 20842.74s]  Actually, actually a shitload of subs.
[20842.74s -> 20846.30s]  Thanks for the 20 subs.
[20846.30s -> 20868.96s]  Thanks for the 20 delicious bananas.
[20868.96s -> 20878.87s]  Not bad.
[20878.87s -> 20904.21s]  I was here, I was here, I was here, I was here.
[20904.21s -> 20911.79s]  Wait, there might be stuff in here.
[20911.79s -> 20915.34s]  Free shit, I have 900 bucks.
[20915.34s -> 20918.23s]  I'm gonna buy something after this.
[20918.23s -> 20938.26s]  On more, remember that one.
[20938.30s -> 20961.78s]  I sounded like a tool shed coming down the stairs.
[20961.78s -> 20970.15s]  Let's finish the job.
[20970.15s -> 20972.82s]  This isn't a pasta.
[20972.82s -> 20973.66s]  Jerma, who are you talking to?
[20973.66s -> 20975.50s]  It's been 12 years since the accident
[20975.50s -> 20977.06s]  and you haven't been taking your medication
[20977.06s -> 20977.90s]  for a few months.
[20977.90s -> 20979.95s]  Okay, thanks.
[20979.95s -> 20980.79s]  Five month subscriber.
[20980.79s -> 20982.15s]  Jerma, who are you talking to?
[20987.47s -> 20990.47s]  Money, lots of it.
[20990.47s -> 20991.67s]  Oh, I missed a shitload of stuff.
[20991.67s -> 20992.51s]  What the hell am I doing?
[20992.51s -> 20993.87s]  Hey, Zurich.
[20993.87s -> 20996.41s]  Zurich, duh, thanks for the $50.
[20996.41s -> 20999.82s]  5,000 bits from Zurich.
[20999.82s -> 21000.90s]  They say banana bros.
[21000.90s -> 21002.55s]  Thanks, man, appreciate it.
[21002.55s -> 21008.20s]  Welcome to the banana bros.
[21008.20s -> 21009.40s]  That's 5,000 bits.
[21009.40s -> 21011.98s]  That's a shitload of money, thank you.
[21011.98s -> 21013.66s]  We had Shady Seas gave 20 community subs.
[21013.66s -> 21015.18s]  They also gave 100 bucks.
[21015.18s -> 21016.78s]  I missed that a long time ago.
[21016.78s -> 21019.47s]  This was like three hours ago.
[21019.47s -> 21023.22s]  Shady Seas, 10,000 bits.
[21023.22s -> 21024.22s]  They say, hope you're doing well, Jerma.
[21024.22s -> 21025.22s]  I just got back from the hospital
[21025.22s -> 21028.28s]  for an infection in my see-some
[21028.28s -> 21030.12s]  that they haven't seemed to figure out what's causing it.
[21030.12s -> 21032.90s]  This is the second time I've ended up hospitalized for it.
[21032.90s -> 21034.14s]  It's frustrating.
[21034.14s -> 21036.90s]  Streams like yours that help getting the recovery easier.
[21038.69s -> 21040.90s]  What's the see-some?
[21040.90s -> 21043.80s]  What's the see-some?
[21043.80s -> 21048.72s]  Wait, where is that?
[21048.72s -> 21053.82s]  Is it in your stomach?
[21053.82s -> 21055.74s]  Connects to the appendix.
[21055.74s -> 21059.00s]  Oh shit.
[21059.00s -> 21062.39s]  Well, hopefully you feel better.
[21062.39s -> 21064.51s]  Second time you've been hospitalized for it.
[21064.51s -> 21068.03s]  Hopefully you don't have to do that again.
[21068.03s -> 21069.27s]  As some of that has medical problems
[21069.27s -> 21071.63s]  that are sort of just don't go away
[21071.63s -> 21072.63s]  and kind of come out of nowhere,
[21072.63s -> 21077.15s]  I can understand where you're coming from.
[21077.15s -> 21080.86s]  But I wish you a complete and swift recovery.
[21080.86s -> 21085.14s]  Medical problems suck.
[21085.14s -> 21090.29s]  Oh, there was a raid too.
[21090.29s -> 21092.60s]  There was a raid from Charborg.
[21092.60s -> 21093.44s]  Thank you, Charborg.
[21093.44s -> 21096.47s]  If any of the Charborgs are still here.
[21096.47s -> 21098.50s]  Thanks, guys.
[21098.50s -> 21100.22s]  Atmostarfish gave five subs.
[21100.22s -> 21102.18s]  NormalOwl gave seven.
[21102.18s -> 21103.30s]  TheFoolie gave five.
[21103.30s -> 21104.62s]  DestroyDude gave five.
[21104.62s -> 21107.06s]  And InkCat gave five.
[21107.06s -> 21108.74s]  Community subs.
[21108.74s -> 21113.02s]  Thanks, guys.
[21113.02s -> 21116.87s]  I missed them from earlier, but as always,
[21116.87s -> 21118.47s]  if anyone wants to give this channel money,
[21118.47s -> 21123.57s]  it's, wait, we have another raid right now.
[21123.57s -> 21124.41s]  Lazy Purple comes in.
[21124.41s -> 21130.72s]  Lazy Purple with a raid.
[21130.72s -> 21133.24s]  Hey everybody from Lazy Purple's stream.
[21133.24s -> 21135.32s]  Hope you had a day full of...
[21141.21s -> 21143.58s]  Streams.
[21143.58s -> 21144.94s]  That was terrible.
[21144.94s -> 21145.78s]  Potassium.
[21145.78s -> 21148.86s]  Hope you had a day full of potassium.
[21148.86s -> 21149.70s]  Cream.
[21149.70s -> 21150.54s]  Banana cream.
[21153.27s -> 21154.15s]  Look, it's been six hours.
[21154.15s -> 21158.39s]  I don't have any comedy routines left in my fucking mind.
[21158.39s -> 21159.23s]  Anyways, thanks for the raid.
[21159.23s -> 21160.07s]  Welcome, everybody.
[21160.07s -> 21164.65s]  Hope you had a good stream.
[21164.65s -> 21167.24s]  Thanks, Lazy Purple.
[21167.24s -> 21168.92s]  Welcome all the Lazy Purples.
[21168.92s -> 21170.71s]  What do you call your community?
[21170.71s -> 21179.42s]  Purples?
[21179.42s -> 21180.70s]  Purple.
[21180.70s -> 21182.34s]  The lazy fucks?
[21182.34s -> 21183.18s]  Is it really?
[21183.18s -> 21184.98s]  I don't know what it is.
[21184.98s -> 21186.77s]  It's pretty funny, actually.
[21189.41s -> 21190.25s]  Thanks, though.
[21190.25s -> 21191.21s]  Welcome, guys.
[21191.21s -> 21192.41s]  This is called...
[21192.41s -> 21193.25s]  You don't know what this is.
[21193.25s -> 21194.09s]  Maybe you do.
[21194.09s -> 21196.13s]  Maybe Lazy's played it.
[21196.13s -> 21197.49s]  It's a game where you just break everything.
[21197.49s -> 21199.77s]  It's a whole game about breaking stuff.
[21199.77s -> 21201.85s]  Every single pixel can be destroyed.
[21201.85s -> 21202.77s]  Every single one.
[21202.77s -> 21205.11s]  No exceptions.
[21205.11s -> 21212.62s]  And the game is called Air It Down.
[21212.62s -> 21218.09s]  I need that computer.
[21218.09s -> 21231.18s]  Oh, thank God it's still standing.
[21231.18s -> 21233.65s]  Tools.
[21233.65s -> 21235.03s]  Hype bomb.
[21235.03s -> 21236.56s]  More.
[21236.72s -> 21237.56s]  I've got a lot of money.
[21237.56s -> 21239.13s]  Should I do...
[21239.13s -> 21241.29s]  I'll be...
[21241.29s -> 21242.25s]  I'm so bad with the planks.
[21242.25s -> 21243.79s]  I can't even use it.
[21243.79s -> 21247.27s]  Max out the shotgun?
[21247.27s -> 21248.11s]  Yeah.
[21248.11s -> 21250.98s]  Let's do max shotgun.
[21250.98s -> 21258.07s]  That's good.
[21258.07s -> 21262.80s]  What's next?
[21262.80s -> 21266.72s]  It's still going.
[21266.72s -> 21267.56s]  I'm right here.
[21267.56s -> 21268.40s]  It's a bit worn down.
[21268.40s -> 21269.24s]  All right.
[21269.24s -> 21272.13s]  Yeah, this is where we have to decrypt the GPS.
[21272.13s -> 21272.97s]  Blue Tide Computers.
[21272.97s -> 21273.81s]  This is a new place.
[21273.81s -> 21276.64s]  This is a new place.
[21276.64s -> 21279.60s]  Steal computers for Parisa to investigate lease payments.
[21279.60s -> 21285.96s]  This is a new area.
[21285.96s -> 21291.47s]  Blue Tide Computers.
[21291.47s -> 21292.55s]  I gotta be honest.
[21294.84s -> 21297.19s]  This game's early access.
[21297.19s -> 21300.42s]  I did not expect it to be
[21300.42s -> 21305.69s]  like a six plus potential hour campaign here.
[21305.69s -> 21307.05s]  And there's a sandbox mode
[21307.05s -> 21313.71s]  and there's a create level mode.
[21313.71s -> 21317.42s]  I mean, if there's ever an early access game
[21317.42s -> 21319.58s]  that I would say this deserves to be supported,
[21319.58s -> 21324.22s]  it's definitely this one.
[21324.22s -> 21327.70s]  I'm shocked that there's a full like six plus hour campaign.
[21327.70s -> 21332.06s]  And it's not done, apparently.
[21332.06s -> 21332.90s]  Better than Watch Dogs?
[21332.90s -> 21333.86s]  Yes, it is.
[21333.86s -> 21335.22s]  This is a better game than Watch Dogs.
[21335.22s -> 21338.06s]  I will say that a thousand times.
[21338.90s -> 21341.81s]  All right, what's our objective?
[21341.81s -> 21344.61s]  A lot, actually.
[21344.61s -> 21349.81s]  Okay, we need to steal this.
[21349.81s -> 21354.59s]  We'll take a look.
[21354.59s -> 21358.21s]  That just repeats whatever words Jerma says.
[21358.21s -> 21370.53s]  This is the best stream on Twitch.
[21370.53s -> 21371.37s]  Oh, don't say true.
[21371.37s -> 21373.94s]  You're supposed to say the other thing I just said.
[21373.94s -> 21379.62s]  This is the worst stream on Twitch.
[21379.62s -> 21382.50s]  This one looks elaborate.
[21382.50s -> 21384.34s]  Very elaborate, actually.
[21384.34s -> 21393.98s]  All right, we gotta go that way.
[21393.98s -> 21394.94s]  It was the best of streams.
[21394.94s -> 21398.29s]  It was the worst of streams.
[21398.29s -> 21400.93s]  Is that Charles Dickens?
[21400.93s -> 21413.45s]  Who is that?
[21413.45s -> 21414.29s]  Can't break that?
[21414.29s -> 21415.69s]  Yes, I can.
[21415.69s -> 21420.48s]  I kill, excuse me?
[21420.48s -> 21425.76s]  That can't be broken?
[21425.76s -> 21427.00s]  What is it, Veggie Tales?
[21435.21s -> 21436.57s]  Yeah, Veggie Tales.
[21436.57s -> 21437.69s]  It was the best of times.
[21437.69s -> 21439.01s]  It was the worst of times.
[21439.01s -> 21441.37s]  Not Veggie Tales.
[21441.37s -> 21442.21s]  No secrets.
[21442.21s -> 21447.34s]  This is stupid.
[21447.34s -> 21448.59s]  What?
[21448.59s -> 21458.43s]  Nothing in the fridge, either.
[21458.43s -> 21459.27s]  Why even do that?
[21459.27s -> 21470.30s]  Why open them when you can just smash them?
[21470.30s -> 21472.45s]  I mean, it's fun to just break stuff.
[21472.45s -> 21475.32s]  That's the only reason why I'm doing this.
[21475.32s -> 21476.76s]  Just fucking throw this thing out the window.
[21476.76s -> 21484.59s]  Who gives a shit?
[21484.59s -> 21485.55s]  Stream's wild.
[21485.55s -> 21486.95s]  I'm too high for this.
[21487.19s -> 21488.03s]  Don't take as much.
[21488.03s -> 21488.87s]  What are you doing?
[21488.87s -> 21493.10s]  What are you talking about?
[21493.10s -> 21496.36s]  Whoa.
[21496.36s -> 21499.85s]  What is this bank vault down here?
[21499.85s -> 21514.94s]  It's a literal bank vault.
[21514.94s -> 21515.78s]  Shit.
[21515.78s -> 21516.62s]  Okay, can I?
[21516.62s -> 21519.74s]  Wait, I can cut through this.
[21519.74s -> 21521.51s]  We're getting in this.
[21521.51s -> 21526.72s]  Oh my God, this is a lot of money.
[21526.72s -> 21531.77s]  I can't get in there.
[21531.77s -> 21547.74s]  Are you serious?
[21547.74s -> 21548.58s]  Don't burn the place down.
[21548.58s -> 21557.71s]  Can I go through the ceiling?
[21557.71s -> 21562.16s]  Dig?
[21562.16s -> 21569.47s]  I don't think I can dig underneath that.
[21569.47s -> 21570.67s]  Keep that in a, keep that over here.
[21570.67s -> 21571.88s]  Wait a minute.
[21571.88s -> 21578.06s]  Go to the ceiling.
[21578.06s -> 21578.90s]  Shit, how do I get in here?
[21578.90s -> 21607.07s]  Where'd that go?
[21607.07s -> 21609.94s]  Shit.
[21609.94s -> 21615.66s]  I always torched this whole place.
[21615.66s -> 21616.62s]  I gotta find a way in there.
[21616.62s -> 21632.02s]  All right, what do we got?
[21632.02s -> 21634.54s]  This has gotta be like a side entrance, right?
[21634.54s -> 21639.21s]  Or like a little thing to go in.
[21639.21s -> 21640.05s]  All right, here we go.
[21640.05s -> 21642.58s]  Look, is it great?
[21642.58s -> 21656.33s]  Is it great?
[21656.33s -> 21674.56s]  Damn it.
[21674.56s -> 21677.77s]  Maybe I can crash into it.
[21677.77s -> 21688.82s]  You think I can just drive into it?
[21688.82s -> 21692.63s]  There is gold down there.
[21692.63s -> 21696.98s]  It's glowing and it's gold.
[21696.98s -> 21709.10s]  That's like probably five grand.
[21709.10s -> 21710.65s]  Side of the house.
[21710.65s -> 21711.90s]  What about the side of the house?
[21711.90s -> 21714.60s]  I'm gonna try the side of the house.
[21714.60s -> 21749.90s]  Give me, oh shit.
[21749.90s -> 21754.46s]  Oh shit.
[21754.46s -> 21756.18s]  I found it.
[21756.18s -> 21757.00s]  I just found it.
[21757.00s -> 21757.84s]  I found it.
[21757.84s -> 21762.12s]  I found it.
[21762.12s -> 21771.44s]  I found it.
[21771.44s -> 21774.24s]  Wait, this is even better.
[21774.24s -> 21776.52s]  It's like a gold mine.
[21776.52s -> 21789.17s]  Wait, where's the house?
[21789.17s -> 21804.58s]  Cube, where's the house?
[21804.58s -> 21807.07s]  This is it?
[21807.07s -> 21812.82s]  I think I found it.
[21812.82s -> 21819.54s]  Let me out of here.
[21819.54s -> 21823.32s]  No, it's not.
[21823.32s -> 21827.18s]  Wait, what did I just find?
[21827.18s -> 21832.36s]  No, this is not even right.
[21832.36s -> 21837.48s]  Get me back over there.
[21837.48s -> 21855.75s]  Wait, how did I end up over here?
[21855.75s -> 21857.43s]  Where the fuck am I?
[21857.43s -> 21867.40s]  I don't even remember where I was.
[21867.40s -> 21868.60s]  I'm hitting things with the hammer.
[21868.60s -> 21870.06s]  That's all I know.
[21870.06s -> 21875.26s]  I don't know anything else.
[21875.26s -> 21878.67s]  I gotta go down there.
[21878.67s -> 21879.93s]  There's a whole underground facility.
[21879.93s -> 21888.05s]  I gotta, ugh.
[21888.21s -> 21889.29s]  Junk.
[21889.29s -> 21907.01s]  What is this junk?
[21907.01s -> 21912.05s]  Here's computer number one.
[21912.05s -> 21914.71s]  All right, not ready for that yet.
[21914.71s -> 21919.09s]  I swear to God, I don't even know what house I was in.
[21919.09s -> 21921.25s]  I don't even know what, I have no idea.
[21921.25s -> 21924.29s]  What house was I in?
[21924.29s -> 21927.61s]  Here?
[21927.61s -> 21930.35s]  I was inside of this, right?
[21930.35s -> 21939.76s]  How did I end up all the way down here?
[21939.76s -> 21944.98s]  No.
[21944.98s -> 21945.82s]  Where the fuck did I go?
[21945.82s -> 21948.08s]  This place is so vast and expansive.
[21948.08s -> 21950.38s]  I don't even know where I am.
[21950.38s -> 21951.20s]  Oh, I've been here.
[21951.20s -> 21952.04s]  Okay, there's damage.
[21952.04s -> 21953.99s]  I've been here.
[21953.99s -> 21954.83s]  This is it.
[21954.83s -> 21955.67s]  Okay, okay, okay, this is it.
[21955.67s -> 21969.21s]  I found it.
[21969.21s -> 21970.05s]  I got it.
[21970.05s -> 21981.44s]  Another computer.
[21981.44s -> 21990.43s]  Okay, computer two.
[21990.43s -> 21991.27s]  Okay, nothing.
[21991.31s -> 21995.06s]  Is there a secret in the wall or something?
[21995.06s -> 21996.20s]  What's this?
[21996.20s -> 22009.90s]  Oh, binoculars.
[22009.90s -> 22011.43s]  What's this?
[22011.43s -> 22018.82s]  See, I gotta have something in the desk, first of all.
[22018.82s -> 22027.48s]  There's nothing in his desk.
[22027.48s -> 22037.02s]  Do I get over there?
[22037.02s -> 22045.40s]  This can't be the end here.
[22045.40s -> 22046.48s]  There's a button.
[22046.48s -> 22049.56s]  Do I have to press this button?
[22049.56s -> 22060.94s]  Oh no, it's a light.
[22060.94s -> 22073.07s]  Really?
[22073.07s -> 22077.41s]  Go this way.
[22077.41s -> 22084.63s]  Fucking asshole.
[22084.63s -> 22104.06s]  I don't even see a way to get in here.
[22104.06s -> 22105.18s]  There's a grate there.
[22105.18s -> 22108.05s]  There's a grate there.
[22108.05s -> 22110.54s]  On the other side there.
[22110.54s -> 22142.37s]  Okay, wait, wait, see what that is?
[22142.37s -> 22143.58s]  It's down here.
[22143.58s -> 22146.43s]  Where is it?
[22146.43s -> 22148.98s]  Where is it?
[22148.98s -> 22156.43s]  There's a little, okay, right here, there's like a vent.
[22156.43s -> 22161.26s]  Oh, that's a welcome mat.
[22161.26s -> 22163.35s]  Oh shit.
[22163.35s -> 22165.09s]  Found it.
[22165.09s -> 22170.84s]  Goodbye.
[22170.84s -> 22172.12s]  No, that was a vacuum cleaner.
[22172.12s -> 22176.79s]  Secret vacuum cleaner?
[22176.79s -> 22187.49s]  Oh, no, this is just a closet.
[22187.49s -> 22191.34s]  This has to be it.
[22191.34s -> 22204.19s]  Okay, hold on.
[22204.19s -> 22247.12s]  How do I, is it, no.
[22247.12s -> 22252.20s]  Shit, is it over here?
[22252.20s -> 22256.90s]  Fuck, no, this is just another one.
[22256.90s -> 22260.05s]  Don't ever come near me again.
[22260.05s -> 22267.78s]  Throw some Chef Boy ID down here.
[22267.78s -> 22283.86s]  I don't understand.
[22283.86s -> 22291.20s]  No, I can't, it's not, you don't swim?
[22291.20s -> 22300.78s]  Did I find it?
[22300.78s -> 22304.44s]  Oh, I think it's connected to something over here.
[22304.44s -> 22306.42s]  What is this?
[22307.14s -> 22309.24s]  Okay, I found it.
[22309.24s -> 22324.58s]  And then there's, where the fuck am I?
[22324.58s -> 22326.51s]  You're gonna plank my way out of here?
[22326.51s -> 22327.59s]  I only have 10 planks left.
[22327.59s -> 22329.07s]  I don't think I can do this in 10 planks.
[22329.07s -> 22338.85s]  I need like 30.
[22338.85s -> 22353.29s]  Wait, what's up there?
[22353.29s -> 22357.95s]  What is up there?
[22357.95s -> 22358.77s]  What the fuck happened?
[22358.77s -> 22371.62s]  Am I inside of the earth?
[22371.62s -> 22373.46s]  I went underneath the game world.
[22373.46s -> 22375.58s]  Is that what really happened?
[22375.58s -> 22385.49s]  Well, I gotta find my way back up.
[22385.49s -> 22404.39s]  Sound, water, wait, I see blinking light.
[22404.39s -> 22422.20s]  Something's blinking over here.
[22422.20s -> 22429.18s]  I think I'm in trouble.
[22429.18s -> 22474.90s]  It's just water.
[22474.90s -> 22482.19s]  Hey, I made it.
[22482.23s -> 22487.98s]  All right, now how do I get in the vent?
[22487.98s -> 22492.62s]  Okay, vent is right there.
[22492.62s -> 22495.21s]  See that?
[22495.21s -> 22508.57s]  Therefore, we're gonna go just straight this way.
[22508.57s -> 22513.70s]  It's right there.
[22513.70s -> 22529.38s]  It's, okay, I gotta keep my, literally right here.
[22529.38s -> 22531.28s]  It's like right here.
[22531.28s -> 22536.97s]  Oh, found it, he found it.
[22536.97s -> 22545.30s]  I found it.
[22545.30s -> 22549.77s]  How do I get up here?
[22549.77s -> 22557.64s]  I can't go up there.
[22557.64s -> 22572.16s]  Hello, I can't go up here.
[22572.16s -> 22573.00s]  Everything okay?
[22573.00s -> 22574.04s]  Am I flying?
[22574.04s -> 22602.70s]  I feel like I'm flying.
[22602.70s -> 22643.38s]  Fucking light, what do I do?
[22643.38s -> 22649.62s]  This is a big one, hold on.
[22649.62s -> 22663.30s]  Can I rotate this?
[22663.30s -> 22685.52s]  How do you rotate an object?
[22685.52s -> 22691.78s]  Leave it here.
[22691.78s -> 22694.61s]  I feel like I'm pretty damn close, guys.
[22694.61s -> 22714.97s]  I feel like I'm actually pretty damn close.
[22714.97s -> 22733.74s]  No, shit, I'm trying to like just stuff myself up there.
[22733.74s -> 22747.69s]  I don't get it, I don't get it.
[22747.69s -> 22787.96s]  There's no other vent, I don't get it.
[22787.96s -> 22797.95s]  What did I think was gonna happen?
[22797.95s -> 22799.55s]  I need to get up here somehow.
[22799.55s -> 22821.79s]  I'm just gonna stack boxes, see if that works.
[22821.79s -> 22823.19s]  No, that's not how you do it.
[22823.19s -> 22829.84s]  I don't know, I don't understand.
[22829.84s -> 22830.68s]  All right, turn off the emote,
[22830.68s -> 22831.52s]  let somebody tell me.
[22831.52s -> 22832.84s]  Turn off the emote, let somebody tell me.
[22832.84s -> 22834.44s]  Turn off the emote, turn it off, I wanna know.
[22834.44s -> 22835.68s]  Tell me, I don't care.
[22835.68s -> 22836.68s]  Tell me how to do it.
[22836.68s -> 22838.82s]  Turn off the emote only, I don't know.
[22838.82s -> 22840.58s]  Turn off the emote, I just wanna, just tell me.
[22840.58s -> 22843.26s]  Spam it, I don't care, tell me.
[22843.26s -> 22844.30s]  Don't you have planks?
[22844.30s -> 22849.01s]  No, they're gone, I don't have any.
[22849.01s -> 22852.92s]  I need planks for this?
[22852.92s -> 22854.92s]  How am I gonna do that?
[22854.92s -> 22855.92s]  No, turn off the emote only
[22855.92s -> 22865.13s]  and I want somebody to tell me what to do.
[22865.13s -> 22871.92s]  Somebody tell me what to do.
[22871.92s -> 22876.18s]  I'll turn it off, I'll turn it off myself.
[22876.18s -> 22884.42s]  Tell me.
[22884.42s -> 22885.82s]  You climb with planks.
[22885.82s -> 22888.28s]  Planks, don't tell him.
[22888.28s -> 22890.28s]  Restart and use planks.
[22890.28s -> 22897.89s]  Shit and piss.
[22897.89s -> 22899.29s]  Reset and use planks.
[22899.29s -> 22917.32s]  Okay, let's go.
[22917.32s -> 22919.32s]  I don't remember what the house was.
[22920.08s -> 22922.72s]  I'm serious.
[22922.72s -> 22928.05s]  Just jump higher.
[22928.05s -> 22929.62s]  All right, it's this one here.
[22929.62s -> 22930.88s]  Over here.
[22930.88s -> 22932.65s]  There it is.
[22932.65s -> 22936.26s]  Okay, get the fuck out of my way.
[22936.26s -> 22938.17s]  Let's go.
[22938.17s -> 22940.17s]  Get this shit off.
[22940.17s -> 22944.42s]  Wait, no, leave that.
[22944.42s -> 22945.26s]  No, get rid of that.
[22945.26s -> 22987.97s]  This is wrong, this is fucking wrong.
[22987.97s -> 22991.22s]  This is wrong, hold on.
[22991.22s -> 23011.40s]  I need to get up high enough where I can go like this.
[23011.40s -> 23028.98s]  No, fuck, wrong one.
[23028.98s -> 23030.26s]  You punk.
[23030.26s -> 23046.38s]  You punk.
[23046.38s -> 23060.87s]  I've jumped over it.
[23060.87s -> 23062.15s]  This is embarrassing.
[23062.15s -> 23064.52s]  I know I'm not supposed to go this way,
[23064.52s -> 23066.74s]  but I don't care.
[23066.74s -> 23069.03s]  Which way do I go?
[23069.03s -> 23081.66s]  That's the wrong vent.
[23082.34s -> 23083.18s]  I need to find a vent.
[23083.18s -> 23092.26s]  Vent.
[23092.26s -> 23093.10s]  That's the right vent.
[23093.10s -> 23093.94s]  You had it.
[23093.94s -> 23094.78s]  It was the right vent.
[23094.78s -> 23095.62s]  That's the right vent.
[23095.62s -> 23097.73s]  What?
[23097.73s -> 23101.10s]  Literally won't fit in that vent.
[23101.10s -> 23113.89s]  No, it's not the right vent.
[23113.89s -> 23115.25s]  The one guy, it's not.
[23115.25s -> 23118.75s]  That's like a thousand guys.
[23118.75s -> 23121.30s]  Vent?
[23121.30s -> 23122.90s]  Is there a vent up here?
[23122.90s -> 23130.51s]  Ow.
[23130.51s -> 23156.19s]  I don't understand.
[23156.19s -> 23160.97s]  Stay determined.
[23160.97s -> 23221.22s]  Did I say stay determined?
[23221.22s -> 23222.50s]  Shit.
[23279.92s -> 23294.16s]  Oh shit.
[23294.16s -> 23295.00s]  Oh.
[23306.71s -> 23311.63s]  I got it, I'm in, I'm in.
[23312.63s -> 23314.19s]  I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
[23314.19s -> 23320.70s]  I'm so in.
[23320.70s -> 23321.54s]  Shit, that's it.
[23321.54s -> 23322.58s]  I'm almost there.
[23322.58s -> 23323.42s]  I'm almost there.
[23323.42s -> 23325.43s]  I'm almost there.
[23325.43s -> 23327.17s]  God, oh my God.
[23327.17s -> 23328.89s]  Okay, slow down.
[23328.89s -> 23330.33s]  Don't do anything crazy.
[23332.85s -> 23334.97s]  Don't do anything insane.
[23334.97s -> 23337.17s]  Don't do anything insane that I wouldn't do.
[23337.17s -> 23338.41s]  I can't be a...
[23341.48s -> 23347.45s]  I stuffed myself in.
[23347.45s -> 23348.77s]  Oh shit.
[23370.70s -> 23372.58s]  I can't walk forward.
[23372.58s -> 23376.14s]  I can't walk forward.
[23376.18s -> 23381.90s]  I can't walk forward.
[23381.90s -> 23395.69s]  I can't walk forward.
[23395.69s -> 23399.72s]  Hey, where's the gold?
[23399.72s -> 23405.58s]  $2,500.
[23405.58s -> 23411.32s]  Always believe in yourself.
[23411.32s -> 23422.69s]  2,500 bucks.
[23422.69s -> 23424.60s]  Save.
[23424.60s -> 23435.40s]  Okay, now how do I open the door?
[23435.40s -> 23440.70s]  You just don't.
[23440.70s -> 23444.63s]  Just vent, right.
[23444.63s -> 23445.47s]  Oh yeah, I could vent.
[23445.47s -> 23451.60s]  Put a hole in the wall?
[23451.60s -> 23452.42s]  Cracked wall?
[23452.42s -> 23453.50s]  What?
[23453.50s -> 23457.50s]  This one means a cracked wall.
[23457.50s -> 23459.98s]  That was the wrong button.
[23459.98s -> 23461.98s]  I thought it was a plank.
[23461.98s -> 23462.82s]  You know what?
[23462.82s -> 23463.66s]  I don't fucking care.
[23463.66s -> 23467.15s]  I'm just gonna go.
[23467.15s -> 23469.83s]  Load the game, right.
[23469.83s -> 23470.91s]  Is it a cracked wall?
[23470.91s -> 23476.60s]  I didn't even see it.
[23476.60s -> 23480.02s]  There is a cracked wall.
[23480.02s -> 23481.68s]  Intriguing.
[23481.68s -> 23490.00s]  Intriguing.
[23490.00s -> 23500.02s]  That's nothing.
[23500.02s -> 23503.46s]  I'm done.
[23503.46s -> 23504.28s]  I have it saved right there.
[23504.28s -> 23508.24s]  I'm done.
[23508.24s -> 23510.69s]  I had to get the 2,500 bucks.
[23510.69s -> 23516.40s]  I had to.
[23516.40s -> 23519.38s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[23519.38s -> 23520.50s]  Tomorrow we're gonna do...
[23520.50s -> 23521.32s]  It's a good question.
[23521.32s -> 23523.88s]  I don't know.
[23523.88s -> 23528.73s]  I'm sure we'll figure it out.
[23528.73s -> 23529.55s]  Quick load?
[23529.55s -> 23535.18s]  Yeah, I will.
[23535.18s -> 23539.90s]  Yeah, I'm good.
[23539.90s -> 23540.74s]  I am actually surprised.
[23540.74s -> 23541.78s]  Is this a sandbox?
[23541.78s -> 23542.62s]  Is it free?
[23542.62s -> 23544.96s]  There's more to do.
[23544.96s -> 23545.80s]  Coin game?
[23545.80s -> 23548.14s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[23548.18s -> 23552.18s]  Did coin game actually come out with the new arcade?
[23552.18s -> 23556.08s]  Did it?
[23556.08s -> 23558.16s]  With actually the new arcade is out?
[23558.16s -> 23559.88s]  The new one?
[23559.88s -> 23561.62s]  If that's correct,
[23561.62s -> 23564.33s]  I'll be playing coin game tomorrow.
[23564.33s -> 23567.03s]  Only if it's the new arcade, not survival mode.
[23567.03s -> 23568.95s]  I know that they were working on a new,
[23568.95s -> 23574.54s]  actual, full arcade again.
[23574.54s -> 23578.61s]  I'll have to take a look at that.
[23578.61s -> 23580.05s]  If it's, like I said last time,
[23580.05s -> 23581.37s]  if it's just the survival mode,
[23581.37s -> 23582.33s]  I've already played all the games.
[23582.33s -> 23586.18s]  I've already got all the tickets and everything.
[23586.18s -> 23587.00s]  We'll see.
[23587.00s -> 23587.92s]  If they added a new arcade,
[23587.92s -> 23590.88s]  I'm gonna play it tomorrow.
[23590.92s -> 23593.63s]  All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[23593.63s -> 23594.87s]  Probably around,
[23597.31s -> 23602.67s]  probably around the same time, noon, 12 noon Pacific,
[23602.67s -> 23605.69s]  12 to one, maybe.
[23605.69s -> 23609.26s]  See you guys tomorrow.
[23609.26s -> 23611.00s]  We are going to go over.
[23611.00s -> 23613.19s]  We're gonna go take a look at the,
[23613.19s -> 23616.65s]  obviously the subs that came in.
[23616.65s -> 23620.94s]  These are all the subs from today, from this stream.
[23620.94s -> 23621.98s]  A lot of them were gifted.
[23621.98s -> 23631.98s]  So thanks guys for the gifted subs, as always.
[23631.98s -> 23633.72s]  It's a pretty good song,
[23633.72s -> 23636.03s]  but no, here's what I was gonna say.
[23636.03s -> 23637.68s]  What I was gonna say is,
[23637.68s -> 23641.72s]  it's rare for a game like this to be in early access
[23641.72s -> 23643.95s]  and be good.
[23643.95s -> 23645.54s]  It's pretty rare.
[23645.54s -> 23646.38s]  So I would,
[23646.38s -> 23651.42s]  here's a full stamp of approval on this game, for sure.
[23651.42s -> 23657.81s]  For sure.
[23657.81s -> 23658.83s]  A German Rumble update.
[23658.83s -> 23662.07s]  Well, I'll just tell you what's gonna happen.
[23662.07s -> 23665.23s]  So at the end of the year,
[23665.23s -> 23669.48s]  there's gonna be a stream on New Year's Eve.
[23669.48s -> 23672.89s]  We'll include both the awards show
[23672.89s -> 23675.69s]  that we typically do the last few years
[23675.69s -> 23679.10s]  and the German Rumble card.
[23679.10s -> 23681.26s]  You know, like four or five matches in the Rumble
[23681.30s -> 23682.46s]  and in between matches,
[23682.46s -> 23685.18s]  we're gonna do like three or four categories.
[23685.18s -> 23687.94s]  Because the idea was,
[23687.94s -> 23690.78s]  there has only been a certain amount of streams this year
[23690.78s -> 23693.11s]  because I took like two or three months off.
[23693.11s -> 23694.67s]  So an entire quarter of this year
[23694.67s -> 23696.54s]  was deleted from this stream.
[23696.54s -> 23699.84s]  So there's a little bit less to kind of choose from
[23699.84s -> 23703.08s]  in regards to nominations and categories.
[23703.08s -> 23704.24s]  So we'll do a double whammy.
[23704.24s -> 23708.67s]  I just scraped your face, I'm sorry,
[23708.67s -> 23712.40s]  on December 31st.
[23712.40s -> 23713.22s]  And you can,
[23713.22s -> 23716.22s]  the nominations, Discord channel,
[23716.22s -> 23719.60s]  and that'll all probably exist in the next few weeks.
[23719.64s -> 23721.04s]  There'll be some around the first of December,
[23721.04s -> 23724.36s]  first week of December.
[23724.36s -> 23728.97s]  Show ankles, show ankles.
[23728.97s -> 23730.17s]  One of these days, I'm just gonna do that.
[23730.17s -> 23732.60s]  I'm just gonna like show my ankles
[23732.60s -> 23735.16s]  and it's gonna be just these big, gross,
[23735.16s -> 23738.58s]  I'm gonna put like prosthetic feet on
[23738.58s -> 23743.86s]  and it's gonna be these big, just gross hobbit feet.
[23743.86s -> 23746.30s]  These gross, just prosthetic ankles.
[23746.30s -> 23749.02s]  And I'll be like, see, oh yeah, that's great, isn't it, huh?
[23749.02s -> 23752.49s]  You like it, huh?
[23752.49s -> 23753.99s]  Oh, look, I'll show ankles.
[23753.99s -> 23757.92s]  Here they are.
[23757.92s -> 23764.30s]  And then everyone would be like, no, no, no, no.
[23764.30s -> 23765.58s]  It would be a Vindigional Impression.
[23765.58s -> 23773.37s]  Ooh, how's it do?
[23773.37s -> 23774.64s]  But no, it should be fun.
[23774.64s -> 23776.38s]  And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[23776.38s -> 23779.43s]  I'm going to run away from the computer now.
[23779.43s -> 23780.27s]  Have a great night.
[23780.27s -> 23781.72s]  See you tomorrow.
[23781.72s -> 23804.91s]  Take care of yourselves.
[23804.91s -> 23808.40s]  Oh, there's a $50 donation that came in.
[23808.40s -> 23811.08s]  I missed it.
[23811.08s -> 23813.00s]  It's from The Zat Zuck.
[23813.00s -> 23816.24s]  Oh, The Zat Zuck IRL.
[23816.24s -> 23818.70s]  Okay, good name, right off the bat.
[23818.70s -> 23820.70s]  It's a 5,000 bit, so it's 50 bucks.
[23820.70s -> 23821.74s]  And then another one just came in.
[23821.74s -> 23824.71s]  Another 5,000, you just,
[23824.71s -> 23826.83s]  $50, $50, back to back, okay.
[23826.83s -> 23829.18s]  Right at the end.
[23830.06s -> 23830.90s]  The Zat Zuck says,
[23830.90s -> 23832.10s]  Jerma, I've been watching your content for over six years now.
[23832.10s -> 23834.99s]  Started when I was like 14, high year old.
[23834.99s -> 23836.35s]  I always watch your VODs,
[23836.35s -> 23838.87s]  even if I'm working on a college assignment or something.
[23838.87s -> 23840.43s]  You're usually in the background.
[23840.43s -> 23843.47s]  I've been working a great job,
[23843.47s -> 23845.31s]  and I've saved enough that I can finally give you support
[23845.31s -> 23846.63s]  like I've always wanted to.
[23846.63s -> 23849.15s]  I made this Twitch account just to do so.
[23849.15s -> 23850.23s]  You're a funny, genuine guy.
[23850.23s -> 23851.47s]  I hope you're doing well.
[23851.47s -> 23857.16s]  Please use your flashlight.
[23857.16s -> 23858.20s]  I said this to other people before,
[23858.20s -> 23861.00s]  but knowing that some people have watched this channel
[23861.04s -> 23863.76s]  since they were like 14, 15,
[23863.76s -> 23866.46s]  and they're now in their 20s.
[23866.46s -> 23868.18s]  It doesn't make me feel old.
[23868.18s -> 23871.02s]  It just makes me feel like I hope,
[23871.02s -> 23873.02s]  I hope that I haven't shaped your brain
[23873.02s -> 23874.34s]  in a way that's not good.
[23876.42s -> 23878.90s]  Yeah, man, all through my incredibly important
[23878.90s -> 23880.18s]  developmental years,
[23880.18s -> 23882.70s]  where I'm incredibly influenced by a lot of things
[23882.70s -> 23884.06s]  that I'm really developing as a person,
[23884.06s -> 23886.06s]  I've spent the whole time pretty much watching you.
[23886.06s -> 23890.50s]  I'm like, oh, well, are you a good guy?
[23890.82s -> 23891.66s]  You're doing good?
[23891.66s -> 23893.26s]  Things are going good, right?
[23893.26s -> 23899.78s]  I didn't like fuck everybody up, right?
[23899.78s -> 23901.10s]  Although people do write like a show,
[23901.10s -> 23902.98s]  like show your dick and like show your ass crack
[23902.98s -> 23904.14s]  and like show your feet on stream.
[23904.14s -> 23910.80s]  But I don't know, did I mess you guys up?
[23910.80s -> 23914.35s]  Nah, thanks though, seriously, that means a lot.
[23914.35s -> 23916.51s]  And then KXZ just gave $50 with no message.
[23916.51s -> 23918.31s]  Just here's 5,000, bitch, just here's 50 bucks.
[23918.31s -> 23924.45s]  Thanks, KXZ, thank you, that's a ton of money.
[23924.45s -> 23927.37s]  Now, last time I streamed, or a couple times ago,
[23927.37s -> 23929.33s]  I wanted to scream.
[23929.33s -> 23931.45s]  I screamed really loud and hit the end stream button,
[23931.45s -> 23933.45s]  and the delay fucked it up.
[23933.45s -> 23935.09s]  So we're gonna try again this time.
