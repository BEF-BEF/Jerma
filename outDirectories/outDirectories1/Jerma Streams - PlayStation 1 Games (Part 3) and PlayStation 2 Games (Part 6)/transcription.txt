[90.81s -> 96.97s]  God damn it, I- really? Why was that turned on? I've been talking for t- okay. I was like,
[96.97s -> 102.98s]  why is nobody sympathizing with me right now? Okay, so listen. Wow, I've been talking for like
[102.98s -> 108.42s]  five straight minutes, like th- I've been talking for three straight minutes. Anyways,
[108.42s -> 117.10s]  I made a little bit of an oopsie. Uh, I um, I- I kind of was moving a table around,
[118.20s -> 123.40s]  because I had to put a table in this room, and I sort of maybe may have fell down and the table
[124.04s -> 131.30s]  like punched me right in the chest and throat. And it's actually kind of funny because I just
[131.30s -> 137.30s]  told this story, and I looked over in chat and I saw somebody say liar in all capitals. So I
[137.30s -> 142.02s]  thought I was unmuted. So I was like, no no no no no, excuse me buddy. I was talking to somebody
[142.02s -> 148.23s]  in chat. Somebody said liar right after I said this whole story two minutes ago. So I just went
[148.23s -> 155.75s]  off on a rant about that guy. And here's what I was about to say. You- if I was lying, if it was
[155.75s -> 161.27s]  like, oh I fell down, I oh have I smashed my chest. It would be 2 40 when I start the stream.
[161.27s -> 166.79s]  It would be an excuse. I'm five minutes early. That's how you know it's not bullshit. Think about
[166.79s -> 173.35s]  that. It would be like, oh 2 45 and I'm just getting started. I fell down. That's why I'm late.
[173.35s -> 182.14s]  I'm five minutes early. But anyways, uh, yeah that sucked. It like hit me right in the fucking
[182.14s -> 188.46s]  collarbone. It was bad. But I'm a little sore. I'm all right. Don't worry. We've got quite a day.
[190.95s -> 197.90s]  Oh, I hope you're okay. Give me sympathy. Give me sympathy. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Thank you.
[204.60s -> 209.74s]  Uh anyways, I'm looking over here and I'm just getting real. You know what? We're going back
[210.78s -> 218.78s]  to- we're going back to 2017 streamer Andy. Those of you that remember that have been around for a
[218.78s -> 228.25s]  while. I've got a stack of PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games. There are about 27 of them.
[230.10s -> 236.89s]  And I may have gone a little overboard. I'm going to give you a spoiler. I'm going to just tell you
[236.89s -> 242.70s]  what one or two of them are. Of course, we're starting with Driver. Driver 1 for the PlayStation
[242.70s -> 248.22s]  1. Right after that, I'm just going to give you just what's coming up next. I'm not going to tell
[248.22s -> 255.37s]  you anything else. We have the Land Before Time Racing Adventure. I feel like a lot of you are
[255.37s -> 263.13s]  going to be really, really happy about that one. So that's the first two. I'm not going to tell you
[263.13s -> 276.81s]  what the other ones are. Boomer game seems lame. Ban that person for an hour. You better fucking
[276.81s -> 288.71s]  have Crash Team Racing. I'm still stuffed here. No, I don't. No, I do have- no, no spoilers. Why
[288.71s -> 291.91s]  would I spoil it? I'm going to show it to you. You know what? Fine. Here's your last spoiler.
[292.63s -> 297.59s]  There are like 30 plus games here. I'm going to tell you one of them. And you need to trust me
[297.59s -> 302.87s]  on this one because people go like, oh, well, he doesn't have Crash Team Racing. What a fucking
[302.87s -> 308.63s]  idiot. Am I? Because I got the Bionicle PS2 game. You sitting down now? Are you going to be quiet
[308.63s -> 320.52s]  now? Are you going to quiet down now? Okay. Are you going to quiet down now? Well, I mean,
[320.52s -> 328.47s]  get excited about that, but quiet down after that. He knows his audience. All right. You guys ready?
[329.91s -> 339.69s]  Driver 1 is already ready to go. It's already here. My fucking chest hurts. Holy shit. Bionicle PS2
[339.69s -> 345.00s]  game. I might not be able to watch the Bionicle movie, but we can play the Bionicle game and
[345.00s -> 353.02s]  pretend we're watching the movie. Is that okay with you guys? Are you guys ready? Are you guys
[353.02s -> 358.41s]  ready? We need to do something very first and foremost. I want to make sure because capturing
[358.41s -> 362.92s]  old- because this is original hardware, by the way. This is original hardware. Capturing old
[362.92s -> 371.37s]  consoles. It's kind of hard. So we need to do a test. I know it's desynced. We're going to do a test.
[372.42s -> 384.36s]  How badly desynced am I? If I go like this, go, go, go, go, go. How was that? Your voice is
[384.36s -> 402.36s]  desynced. Okay. Hold on. Let's go for that. It should be lined up. How about this? Okay. So that
[402.36s -> 410.58s]  you tell me that's not lined up. Are you hearing me first or is my mouth moving and then you're
[410.58s -> 424.36s]  hearing me or are you hearing me and then my mouth moving? Which one? We hear you first. Okay. How's
[424.36s -> 435.02s]  this? How is that? Is that any better? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[435.02s -> 446.09s]  Is it better? Still bad. It's worse. How does that make any sense? You hear me first? That's
[446.09s -> 459.42s]  impossible. Okay. Hold on. Hello. My name is Jerma. It's really good to see you. How are you doing
[459.42s -> 467.58s]  today? Now it's like two seconds. Wait. People are saying better. People are saying closer. Still bad.
[467.58s -> 474.31s]  Okay. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. Better, but still delayed. This is very confusing because here's
[474.31s -> 477.35s]  how this works for those of you that, you know, those of you that, you know, don't know that that
[477.35s -> 482.71s]  much about tech like I do. So I, because I'm capturing this console through a capture card,
[483.83s -> 490.55s]  the actual video is delayed. Like the video, the actual video game is delayed by about one full
[490.55s -> 497.75s]  second. So what I have to do is I have to delay my webcam and delay my voice by the same amount
[497.75s -> 502.58s]  of time that the video is delayed. And I thought I had it correct, but apparently not because they
[502.58s -> 510.09s]  should match up perfectly. So give me a second. That's weird. So why is that happening? This,
[510.09s -> 516.09s]  we do this now. So I don't have a meltdown in the middle of driver one. You know what I'm saying?
[516.09s -> 520.55s]  This should not be happening. So is this okay? So you still, are you hearing me first still?
[521.61s -> 526.84s]  What if I do this? Hi everybody. It's me, Jerma. How's everybody doing? You're doing good.
[527.40s -> 535.24s]  What's what's happening? How are you? But here's the problem. This is why this is going to get
[535.24s -> 552.81s]  weird. Cause watch this one. That's off one, two, three. Now that's delayed. It's two or three
[552.81s -> 559.34s]  seconds off voices. What is it? I don't, I've never had this problem before. I'm, I'm, I'm
[559.34s -> 569.06s]  delaying the video by 500 milliseconds and I'm delaying the audio by 500 milliseconds.
[569.06s -> 580.02s]  So what's happening here? I'm very confused. Is this, how is this? Hold on. Why is this so
[580.02s -> 586.65s]  fucked up? Okay. So now I'm delaying it again and now it should, it's here we go. One, two,
[586.65s -> 600.07s]  three, four. It should be synced. No. All right. What? Okay. This is the only time this has ever
[600.07s -> 606.15s]  happened. So I'm delaying my audio by 500 milliseconds and I'm delaying my video by 500
[606.15s -> 613.06s]  milliseconds. Why are they not matched up? That doesn't make any sense. I'm delaying the audio
[613.06s -> 622.10s]  by 500 and I'm delaying the video by 500. What's going on? What the fuck's happening? The video is
[622.10s -> 630.18s]  slower. Why the fuck is that happening? Hold on. I think I know why. All webcams are trash. That's
[630.18s -> 642.71s]  why. Hold on. All webcams are garbage. Don't believe any of the lies. Hold on. The webcam is slower.
[642.71s -> 650.58s]  I don't get it. Hold on a second. He's reading off of a script. All right. What if I do this?
[657.10s -> 673.51s]  Is it better? One, two, three, four, five. No. What the hell is going on? All right. So let me delay.
[674.07s -> 679.66s]  We're getting these bugs out of the way first because I cannot tell you why this is happening.
[680.54s -> 684.76s]  Every time you've ever seen a console game, I've done it like this and it's been fine.
[684.76s -> 695.37s]  So what about this? Hi. How are you? Just delay the audio to match the cam. That's what I did.
[695.37s -> 707.32s]  They were both at 500. How is it worse? The webcam is still too late. I've done it like this literally
[707.32s -> 711.70s]  every single time I've ever delayed the webcam. I don't get it. What happened? What changed? I've
[711.70s -> 720.42s]  got the PS1. Worst bit. This is not a bit. I swear to God. It doesn't make any fucking sense.
[720.42s -> 727.32s]  How is it getting worse? I don't know because technology is stupid. My webcam is delayed by
[727.32s -> 731.40s]  500 milliseconds. My audio is delayed by 500 milliseconds. Where are the scientists to
[731.40s -> 742.38s]  explain to me what's going on? Delay the audio by longer. It's going to fuck up how I capture it.
[742.38s -> 755.37s]  Hold on. This is a mess. It's all right. Let's try this. Why would that make any sense? So I'm
[755.37s -> 761.13s]  delaying my audio by 750 and I'm delaying the camera by 500. Excuse me? What's going on here?
[761.13s -> 770.87s]  Hello? Hi. How does that make? How does that make any fucking sense? How does that make any sense?
[773.26s -> 780.34s]  I need an audio engineer. How does that make any sense? Better? All right. But what about this
[780.34s -> 792.95s]  though? One, two, one, two, one. I got to match the video. The latency difference is malady.
[792.95s -> 802.12s]  Delay the audio by a little bit more. Why? What the fuck thousand times? I've never had to do this
[802.12s -> 812.22s]  before. One, two, one, two, one, two, one. Hi. Hello there. My name is Jerma985. I am ready to stream.
[812.86s -> 818.70s]  We're getting rid of the technical problems before we start. Am I lip syncing correctly?
[825.13s -> 832.46s]  Yeah. Good enough. Close enough. I don't understand this. All right. Let's go. Are you ready?
[833.02s -> 843.13s]  I'm closing the lid. That means we got to go. It's serviceable. The camera is like 50 mil. Wait,
[843.13s -> 846.01s]  hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to get this right. We got, I got like, I'm going to be here
[846.01s -> 856.14s]  all night like this. How's that? Hello, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jerma985. I'm here to stream
[856.14s -> 865.54s]  some PlayStation 1 video games and I am here to describe to you what it feels like to have this
[865.54s -> 881.24s]  controller in my hand. It's still bad. It's not good enough. You overcorrected. What the fuck?
[881.24s -> 889.14s]  I've never had this experience before. No, it's food. Audio is now delayed. Wait, hold on. Let's
[889.14s -> 898.87s]  see if we can get the Goldilocks here. The stream hasn't even started yet. Welcome everyone to a
[898.87s -> 919.58s]  live stream on Twitch.tv. I'm Jerma985. Hi everybody. Welcome. My name is Jerma985.
[919.58s -> 930.66s]  It's a very beautiful day out today. It's a sunny, shining day. Good. It's so close. Clap, clap,
[930.66s -> 944.98s]  clap, clap, clap. Okay. Wait, one, two, one, two. Is that synced? Are we good? Good. Absolutely
[944.98s -> 952.79s]  perfect. Stop over pronouncing words. All right. Don't touch anything. The video might be delayed
[952.79s -> 962.50s]  slightly. Don't tell me that. Make it, okay. We've been in a nightmare for 10 minutes. People just
[962.50s -> 969.06s]  showed up. Look, I don't have an intro screen. You just watched it. It was 17 minutes.
[969.06s -> 976.90s]  It's slightly off. Don't tell him it's slightly off. Do head movements to match. Down, up, down,
[978.54s -> 1003.88s]  up, down. Are we good? What'd you say? Get a movie clapper. Good. It's actually perfect. Play the
[1003.88s -> 1008.62s]  game. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. Welcome everybody to a PlayStation 1 game.
[1008.62s -> 1021.14s]  Let's close the lid. I'm ready. Are you ready? Welcome to PlayStation 1 Grab Bag Night. We're
[1021.14s -> 1031.32s]  starting with Driver 1. There's somebody on Twitter that has been asking me to play this
[1033.93s -> 1041.85s]  for, I believe it's been three straight years. Just to let that person know I'm here doing it.
[1041.85s -> 1045.37s]  So you're probably going to have to, you're probably going to have to
[1046.58s -> 1054.92s]  stop doing that Twitter. Why are you so sweaty already? All right. This is GT Interactive
[1054.92s -> 1067.70s]  Software Presents. This is Driver 1. This is a very important one. Is it going to be too loud?
[1067.70s -> 1070.66s]  I got memory cards. I was prepared for this, except for the fact that I had to change my,
[1070.66s -> 1098.84s]  whatever. Why did you turn your head that many times? What are you looking for?
[1104.63s -> 1128.10s]  That was just to prove that this was a 3D game. Am I stealing this car?
[1135.91s -> 1171.69s]  Is this my car? You've got your parking space. I just imagine the person that ran that Twitter
[1171.77s -> 1177.05s]  is sprinting into this room. It's just like, oh, I'm not ready. I didn't know he was even
[1177.05s -> 1218.30s]  doing this today. Why is it so loud? Though he was stealing it. Who was that?
[1230.23s -> 1238.70s]  Have we been just driving around in a circle the whole time? Driver, you are the wheel man.
[1244.15s -> 1251.37s]  Going back to these old games and seeing these old cut scenes, it's crazy what's been able to
[1251.37s -> 1259.98s]  happen here. That reminded me of an old GTA machinima, right? Turn the graphics up.
[1262.66s -> 1271.42s]  Audio is behind. The game audio is behind now. Don't even get started on that. All right. So
[1271.42s -> 1278.74s]  what do I do? No, no, it's fine. It's fine. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's fine. Just stop,
[1278.74s -> 1285.70s]  stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop it. One guy. Okay. So what do I want to do? Undercover car chases,
[1285.70s -> 1302.46s]  training, cheats. What do I do? Training, right? Car park. Okay. So this is the tutorial.
[1302.46s -> 1307.02s]  Somebody said I would not finish this. They said you're never going to finish the tutorial.
[1307.02s -> 1309.98s]  I think it was like a guarantee you won't beat the first level in Lord of the Rings, right?
[1309.98s -> 1334.20s]  What is it trying to show me? Demonstration. Oh, I have to do all those things. Okay.
[1334.92s -> 1350.55s]  Will you beat the tutorial in 30 minutes? What? You will not beat this.
[1357.74s -> 1368.84s]  Do a lap. It's no, it's not analog. What? Oh, it's not. Okay. It's not an analog game, right?
[1376.23s -> 1398.74s]  All right. Let's go. Show us what you got. All right. Did it burn out? So what's handbrake?
[1399.46s -> 1410.33s]  Oh, this way. This is reverse. Go away. I gotta go fast. What's brake? Okay. Handbrake is what?
[1410.89s -> 1434.81s]  I think it's L1. Ooh, I got it. 360. Oh, you can only do it four times before it's over.
[1434.81s -> 1451.02s]  All right. Hold on. Okay. Here we go. What's brake? Okay. Give me the controls.
[1451.82s -> 1464.92s]  Whoa. I just did it. Okay. Hold on. Reverse 180. So like, is that, how is that not a reverse 180?
[1467.61s -> 1480.90s]  Reverse 180. It's way, you're doing way to go faster. Who the fuck is this other person up here?
[1480.90s -> 1504.09s]  They're annoying me. I'm turning too slow. All right. What's handbrake L1? Wait, this is timed?
[1505.05s -> 1526.54s]  It's on a timer? No, it's not. Maybe I'll give you a call if I need a ride to the grocery store.
[1527.34s -> 1570.89s]  Oh, okay. I don't even understand it. Can I skip this? Okay. I have an idea. This is impossible.
[1571.53s -> 1590.34s]  What am I even? Lap? What do you mean do a lap? Watch the tutorial again. Okay. Hold on. I thought
[1590.42s -> 1599.18s]  it was just showing me the buttons. Let me watch it again. Do I even need to beat the tutorial?
[1599.18s -> 1609.19s]  Okay. Let's watch it. Let me try. Read the instructions. There are no instructions.
[1609.19s -> 1625.82s]  It's just like a hand cam of a streamer. That's way better than me. You didn't even get it. He's
[1625.82s -> 1648.41s]  not even unlocking anything. What? What the fuck? Okay. Here it comes to reverse. I did that. What
[1648.41s -> 1664.38s]  about speed? How fast can you go here? Okay. So he drives straight into the wall and lap is imagining
[1664.38s -> 1673.34s]  just a lap around the whole thing. Okay. All right. I get it. Let's go. Ready? Three, two,
[1673.34s -> 1712.98s]  one, go. I'll get the speed first. Lap. All right. Wait. What the fuck? Wait. Turn around.
[1713.86s -> 1751.62s]  That's not it? I have to weave through these, right? Why is it not doing the 180? No, I'll get
[1751.62s -> 1756.71s]  it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.
[1756.71s -> 1768.33s]  I'll get it. I'll get it. Don't worry. I got it. I got it. Speed first. Okay. Now we're going to
[1768.33s -> 1800.63s]  do reverse. How is that too slow? How is it too slow? You're turning too early. I don't understand.
[1800.63s -> 1835.90s]  Just tap the handbrake. Handbrake. Handbrake. Dude, this, I don't, why can I not do a 180?
[1835.90s -> 1840.58s]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Use the steering wheel. I'm doing, I'm using,
[1862.01s -> 1865.85s]  follow the ghost car. I thought you said that was my ghost car. Why would I follow this shitty
[1865.85s -> 1873.51s]  ghost car that I, it's not me. Wait, that's not me. I, oh, I thought that was me.
[1874.55s -> 1908.34s]  Like Mario Kart style. All right. Come on. Come on. I don't get the reverse 180. I can't do it.
[1919.50s -> 1934.71s]  I don't, I don't understand. I can't get it to work. How is that not a reverse 180?
[1935.43s -> 1943.54s]  I'm only doing this for five minutes. This is why everybody wanted me to play it. All right.
[1943.54s -> 1954.47s]  Play driver one. Don't tell them. Yeah. Cause this tutorial is stupid. Yeah. I remember reading
[1954.47s -> 1959.75s]  the reviews on this. Yeah. Like, I don't understand. Like I guess can't beat the tutorial. Like,
[1959.75s -> 1962.87s]  I don't know. What were they thinking? What were they thinking? You know what I mean? That's,
[1962.87s -> 1975.53s]  that's what I, that's where I am right now. I give up. I don't even care. I'm just gonna play
[1975.53s -> 1984.49s]  the game. I'm just, I think I'm just playing the game. You can't bail on the tutorial game
[1984.49s -> 2046.41s]  journalist. Don't, I'll get it right now. Five minutes. Ah, how was that not a reverse 180?
[2046.41s -> 2085.16s]  That's exactly what I just did. Escape sucks. I'm done. I'm not playing it anymore. It's, it,
[2085.16s -> 2109.98s]  it handles like a wet sock. Everybody was waiting for me to play this. You guys were all just like,
[2109.98s -> 2114.38s]  I can't wait. Here we go. Guaranteed fucking meltdown scream. No, it's not.
[2115.26s -> 2155.03s]  I'll give you a fucking meltdown right here. Get out of here. What do you got? Come on. Come on.
[2155.03s -> 2160.94s]  I'm not going to lose the tutorial and driver. Uh-uh. That should be about even 30 minutes.
[2160.94s -> 2176.07s]  How long does that take? How long does it take? That was less than 30 minutes. Who do you think
[2176.07s -> 2192.94s]  you are? Oh, who do you think you are? I am. All right. I did it. All right. Let's play driver one.
[2192.94s -> 2204.12s]  All right. So we got undercover new game. Truth is Tanner, three years on the department and you're
[2204.12s -> 2211.77s]  still the best driver I got. We don't get too many ex-racing boys in here. Lowlife rumble in Miami
[2211.77s -> 2217.80s]  is there's a hunt on for a guy who can pump the gas. Big getaway, big job, maybe even some kind
[2217.80s -> 2226.17s]  of hit. Some hood by the name of Rufus is in the picture. We need a line on it. Coffee? Yeah. Black,
[2226.17s -> 2236.44s]  right? Guys upstairs were asking for you in person. Look, we need you to go under, but no one's going
[2236.44s -> 2244.02s]  to know except me. If I bring anyone else in very wanted, by the way, why do they need your badge?
[2245.26s -> 2264.28s]  Any questions? Wait, I'm a police officer undercover. Remember this game is old. Yeah.
[2264.92s -> 2274.44s]  What is this? I just did this. I just did this. Why do I have to do this? I just did it.
[2281.85s -> 2320.49s]  Why do I have to do this again? What the fuck? No, I don't have to do this again. Do I? That was
[2320.49s -> 2328.95s]  the training. That was not the tutorial. Okay. Why did you let me do that? Why weren't you guys
[2328.95s -> 2334.15s]  screaming at the top of your lungs for me not to do training to get right into the new game?
[2345.35s -> 2367.06s]  Shit. Why am I doing this? I should have already did it. Why weren't you screaming at me?
[2367.86s -> 2395.22s]  We're going to do lap first. Give me that fucking 180. I didn't. Okay. The slalom slalom slalom.
[2397.30s -> 2399.78s]  Oh, fuck. No, you have to start with that. You have to start with slalom.
[2400.34s -> 2423.69s]  Do you have to start with that? There's no way you have to start with that. It's literally
[2423.69s -> 2430.65s]  impossible if you don't. I can't believe I'm doing this twice. I cannot fucking believe it. I can't
[2430.65s -> 2434.89s]  believe it. I forget how to start. I forget where you start it. You go like this way, right?
[2437.43s -> 2459.66s]  Do I start left or right? I already did it. I don't remember where to start
[2460.38s -> 2465.05s]  because you have to do the slalom fucking perfectly or it doesn't register. Oh my God. I
[2465.05s -> 2493.72s]  hate this game. How the fuck does that not count already? Now is that not a 180? What
[2493.72s -> 2511.94s]  fucking crack is this game smoking? How did I not just do the stupid giving up empty parking garage?
[2512.66s -> 2548.12s]  All right, let's go off with this. Turn faster.
[2551.64s -> 2557.08s]  Guys, it's a PlayStation one game. There's no pressure sensitive turning. It's either held
[2557.08s -> 2578.66s]  right or don't at all. How is that not a fucking 180? I just I'm doing a reverse 180.
[2579.86s -> 2586.28s]  What are you speaking of? What are you speaking of? How is that not a reverse 180?
[2587.24s -> 2633.69s]  What are you speaking of? We've got a job only you can handle. We need you to go on your cover and
[2633.69s -> 2638.65s]  go find those criminals. And by the way, can you slalom around these 10 times while I watch?
[2639.45s -> 2640.57s]  No, fuck you, buddy.
[2677.75s -> 2686.42s]  How do I burn out? How do I burn out? How do I burn out? How do I burn out?
[2686.98s -> 2691.30s]  How do I burn out? Tell me. Somebody tell me quick. How do I burn out? Quick.
[2691.30s -> 2710.04s]  Maybe I'll give you a call when I need a ride. How do I burn out? Circle. Oh my. You're a whiny
[2710.04s -> 2719.72s]  baby. It's a specific button to burn out. You tell me there's a burnout button on this fucking
[2719.72s -> 2727.69s]  computer video game. There's a circle is burnout. It's not handbrake and gas, right? It's not break
[2727.69s -> 2800.41s]  and get right. Like, okay. Okay. It's a button. Oh, I got it. Wait, save the game. I'm not doing
[2800.41s -> 2828.39s]  that ever again. I don't care. Just eat. Did I do it? All right. Thank God. Okay. Wait. Oh,
[2828.39s -> 2834.57s]  there it is. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good. Very good. Very good. All right. We're good.
[2834.57s -> 2839.93s]  It's been 45 minutes. Well, technically it didn't start and it's been about 25 minutes. We're good.
[2839.93s -> 2862.06s]  We're ready. Why is it a different menu? Options? Get a new job. Why am I crawling around on the
[2862.06s -> 2884.60s]  floor? Okay. New job. You have one new message. Okay. We want to use you to be real sleepy.
[2884.60s -> 2905.34s]  You want it? Um, do I have to call them back? Oh, okay. Let's go. It's Charlie and Frank's
[2905.34s -> 2918.46s]  apartment from Always Sunny. It's bright. Bellany? Wait, why do I have one? We have one minute to
[2918.46s -> 2925.34s]  rob a bank. Why are we doing this in the amount of time it takes to watch a YouTube short? What's
[2925.34s -> 2943.38s]  fucking, what are we talking about? Where is it? One minute? Wait, up here? Is this a bank?
[2944.50s -> 2963.88s]  That's not a bank. What is the bank over here? Where is this bank? Bro, this is somebody's house.
[2964.76s -> 2989.62s]  Oh, there's like a big thing over here on the mini-map. Is it that way? Is it right there?
[2990.34s -> 3017.85s]  It's right there. Yeah! What? It's right, what? We're right here. What are you talking about?
[3017.85s -> 3047.74s]  What? Nice Target t-shirt. Wait, oh, you can, oh. Nope. I don't even know what the mini-map was
[3047.74s -> 3065.42s]  trying to tell me before. This is it. We're good. We're good. I got it. I thought there was a side
[3065.42s -> 3072.33s]  street I could cut through. I did the same exact thing. Move your fat head. I can't see.
[3074.98s -> 3107.54s]  My god, get out of the fucking way. What did I drive? Directly in, I was trying so desperately
[3107.54s -> 3113.38s]  to avoid that pole, and I drove directly into its square. Exactly, directly dead center of the car.
[3114.58s -> 3118.02s]  I was so obsessed with trying to avoid that. That's why I did what I just did.
[3118.74s -> 3155.35s]  Excuse me. Please don't fall off. All right, I got it. I'm right here. Too early? What do you
[3155.35s -> 3177.83s]  mean it's too early? What? Why are we picking up a Star Trek crew? Why did Captain Kirk just come
[3177.83s -> 3217.35s]  out? What was that? Where are we going? Where do we go? Fuck. Okay. Why is time going up? Wait,
[3217.35s -> 3231.54s]  am I gaining time or losing time? I'm so confused. What? Am I gaining time or was I, the time counted
[3231.54s -> 3246.58s]  down and then it was counting up? The game is so loud. Okay, this is a stopwatch. So I have to be
[3246.58s -> 3252.17s]  here within 10 seconds and then I have to, I thought I was up against the clock. I wasn't.
[3252.97s -> 3258.54s]  I kept looking up and seeing, oh, 20 seconds left, 30 seconds left, 40 seconds left. I was like,
[3258.54s -> 3264.49s]  how am I, am I running over little like watches or something? All right, I got it right now.
[3265.29s -> 3298.95s]  Wait, I took the wrong turn again. Okay, it doesn't matter because I have to be here within
[3298.95s -> 3313.64s]  10 seconds anyways. I'm here too early half the time. Nobody said it's still way too loud.
[3314.52s -> 3342.26s]  That was a 3D movie maker effect. Okay, here we are. Don't show up too early. Okay, now we go.
[3343.22s -> 3352.89s]  Pick everybody up. Here comes the whole, okay, now we get out of here. But I don't, I don't have to
[3352.89s -> 3391.16s]  freak out here. I want to go up this main highway. All right, let's go. There's way too many people
[3391.24s -> 3432.18s]  on the road here. Oh, what the fuck? Go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay. I think I was weaving around and
[3432.18s -> 3475.00s]  the police officer ran into somebody. No, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Let's go.
[3483.54s -> 3493.22s]  Minute 45. What's wrong with that? This game is kind of fun. Oh, by the way, for those of you that
[3493.22s -> 3498.87s]  are wondering every 30 to 40 minutes, we switch games. It's been an hour and I haven't switched
[3498.87s -> 3515.29s]  too bad. And the intro was 20 minutes. That's true. We didn't really get into this until about
[3515.29s -> 3526.04s]  20 minutes ago. I still got about 20 minutes. There's so many games behind me. It is a daunting
[3526.04s -> 3531.86s]  amount of video games in CDs that are right here. I look back and it's like, oh my goodness. Okay,
[3531.86s -> 3540.98s]  we've got a lot to do. 20 plus 20 is 30. Well, 30 to 45 usually is the dealer. All right,
[3540.98s -> 3548.57s]  what about another job? Show them? No, I don't want to give any spoilers.
[3573.59s -> 3580.39s]  Who's censoring my calls for me? Was he doing that on his end?
[3582.46s -> 3598.15s]  Name's Deco. Which one should I do? That's it? He definitely left another message and just said,
[3598.15s -> 3612.38s]  it's me. Oh no, I skipped it. Which one should I do? The first one? All right, we'll do one more
[3612.38s -> 3630.76s]  and see how I feel. And then we're going to move on to this next one. Hide the evidence. Okay.
[3633.16s -> 3676.71s]  Take it to the breakers. New car. This car handles a lot differently. This dude is relentless. Get
[3676.71s -> 3683.51s]  away from me. Oh wait, his car got fucked up. All right, you can't hit anybody. Stop telling me to.
[3684.39s -> 3708.89s]  We're going to do this again. When is the driver? I know. What? I thought you said driver two.
[3723.26s -> 3741.96s]  Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. I get it. Good. Stop. Who cares? Just go. Why do I care so much about
[3741.96s -> 3770.79s]  doing that? It's like just burning in the back of my head. Shit. What? There's a roadblock.
[3771.51s -> 3811.02s]  Okay. We're not going that way. We're going a different way. Where's the cop? Okay. Great.
[3812.18s -> 3832.47s]  And left and then right. I tried to hit every single object on the way over here. Okay.
[3838.36s -> 3865.43s]  Got no cops right now. That's good. I got to do the Mario Kart technique. How have you not
[3865.43s -> 3877.38s]  crashed already? Everybody does. If you do that in front of somebody, they freak out because they
[3877.38s -> 3901.43s]  don't want to hit you while they're passing you. And then you'll make them spin out. How have you
[3901.43s -> 3936.94s]  not crashed into somebody? Let's go. This place is far away. Oh, that jump did nothing for me at all
[3936.94s -> 3942.31s]  and ruined everything actually. I was supposed to go off that way faster. That was very lame.
[3945.85s -> 3971.77s]  I was supposed to go off that five times faster. That was lame. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[3971.77s -> 3997.40s]  We're good. One more. Blow right by this cop right here. 180. I love when cars harmonize in
[3997.40s -> 4019.10s]  video games, don't you? You know, like we're harmonizing. Stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop.
[4038.07s -> 4054.62s]  We're good. Nice. You should stick to TikTok. Dude, I've never opened the app TikTok once.
[4054.62s -> 4070.62s]  Whenever I tell you guys about watching TikTok, it's like going to TikTok.com and using getting
[4070.62s -> 4083.98s]  a link that somebody sent. I've never opened it. Or I look at TikTok compilation videos.
[4083.98s -> 4088.95s]  That's the same thing. Is it? I don't have like a TikTok account. Somebody's like, oh, look at this
[4088.95s -> 4095.64s]  TikTok video I found. I just opened it on like a website. I go, oh, that was okay. I don't care.
[4095.64s -> 4108.36s]  You're addicted. I don't watch TikTok. I don't. Stop it. That's worse. What do you mean? How is
[4108.36s -> 4120.54s]  that worse? All right. We'll do one more mission and then we'll move on. We want to talk to you.
[4120.54s -> 4127.96s]  We want to talk to you. That's it? The marino. Oh. We'll just hang loose till you get your ass
[4127.96s -> 4143.69s]  round here. Okay. Am I going to get double crossed? You need to do driver one all stream. No.
[4146.23s -> 4150.39s]  No, that's not happening. It's like, it's like 500 games behind me.
[4159.62s -> 4168.94s]  All right. I'm actually timed for this one. Go meet them. Is that, are they on the map right there?
[4168.94s -> 4174.54s]  Where is, where is, where are they? What am I? I don't know. Where am I supposed to be going?
[4175.26s -> 4193.29s]  Like over here? Hey, driver crawled so GTA could walk. Okay. All you haters in the chat right now.
[4194.01s -> 4220.66s]  What'd I do? GTA one came out probably like five years before this game. Do I have to bring the
[4220.66s -> 4236.66s]  cops? What did you say? Play it. Driver was made for aliens so they wouldn't get attached to earth.
[4241.56s -> 4272.07s]  What does that even mean? Where's this? Where's the road? So the frame rate drops to like zero
[4272.07s -> 4288.42s]  right there. Look at this. Why is it chugging so hard? Which road should I go on? This one or the
[4288.42s -> 4319.75s]  big one? All right. I just bounced. Oh, come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go, punch, punch, punch, punch.
[4320.55s -> 4338.94s]  This is so far away still. There's no way I do this one. One more try and that's it. That's it.
[4338.94s -> 4343.19s]  One last try and then I'm going to put in a different game. Final one last try. One try.
[4343.99s -> 4372.55s]  That was, that one didn't count. That one didn't count. Okay. Go. I'm going to, I'm not going to
[4372.55s -> 4379.37s]  go right. I'm going to go straight here. Right. And then go down this road up here.
[4380.33s -> 4389.13s]  This one right here. Yep. Yep. Okay. Go, go, go, go. Down this main highway right here.
[4391.85s -> 4396.38s]  Why was I speeding? Why am I in trouble? I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything.
[4396.94s -> 4412.94s]  Did I do it? Did I fuck it up? I went down the wrong thing, didn't I?
[4413.90s -> 4420.60s]  No, I'm okay. I'm all right. Can I go down this way? I can't tell from the map.
[4425.66s -> 4431.83s]  Dude, I can't, I can't tell from the map. Oh, come on. Doesn't it look like I can drive down there?
[4432.87s -> 4443.22s]  What even is that? I'm doing this one more time. I swear to God. You did the same mistake. All
[4443.22s -> 4446.82s]  right. I'm not making that mistake again. This is the last try and then I'm putting in a,
[4448.02s -> 4458.95s]  I'm putting in the land before time racing adventure. I'm not making that same mistake
[4458.95s -> 4473.13s]  every time. I'm going left. You're going to think it's crazy, but I'm doing it.
[4476.95s -> 4503.75s]  Now we're going to go right up here and then I'm going to go straight and then we're going to go
[4503.75s -> 4540.82s]  right up here and straight. Go. Just stay straight the whole time. There we go. Okay. We're good.
[4540.82s -> 4564.49s]  All right. There's a roadblock up here. I feel through very slowly.
[4574.60s -> 4600.55s]  That fucking idiot wasn't in the way. This is fine. All right. I think he crashed.
[4630.71s -> 4679.16s]  Where's the entrance? Where's the entrance? Isn't there a bigger entrance?
[4679.96s -> 4694.79s]  What? I thought there was a, I thought there was a bigger entrance. I went way too far. All right.
[4694.79s -> 4698.15s]  This is it right here. If I don't get it right here, I'm literally turning off the console and
[4698.15s -> 4742.68s]  pulling up this. Sorry. Where's the road I can go down? Is it this one here? I don't know. The
[4742.68s -> 4788.06s]  big shadow is taking up the whole mini map. I don't, I can't see. Why are my eyes so watery?
[4796.73s -> 4802.97s]  No, no, no. It was the wrong road. Oh my God. It's the wrong fucking road.
[4803.05s -> 4830.25s]  There's one road to get over there. There's one road and it's check it out. This is it right here.
[4830.25s -> 4850.97s]  I swear to God. I swear to God. This is it. I got it right here. I got it. It was a perfect,
[4850.97s -> 4855.53s]  there was no avoiding that car crash. They were coming from every piece,
[4856.25s -> 4861.45s]  every angle. There was no escaping. Everyone was driving to stop me from completing this mission.
[4862.33s -> 4887.10s]  Stop driving into me. All right. Here it is. This one right here. Go.
[4900.41s -> 4912.74s]  Making good time. Good time. Nope. It's not the wrong road. Look,
[4912.74s -> 4915.62s]  I was up to the one to the right, the road to the right. That's when I was up before.
[4915.62s -> 4980.10s]  I'm on the right one. There's a block here. Save. Stop talking. I got it for sure. Yes.
[4983.21s -> 4997.34s]  Need you to make an exchange. This case for a locker key. It's a sweet deal.
[4997.34s -> 5003.58s]  Cash for a key in and out. Wham, bam, boom. Meet them at the marina. Get the key or stay out of town.
[5004.22s -> 5011.99s]  This message is crazy. I just slammed my head so hard against the top of my door frame, putting up
[5011.99s -> 5017.80s]  lights. And all I could hear was the obscenely loud sirens playing from the game on my laptop.
[5017.80s -> 5026.44s]  For a second, I truly believed I fucking died to a germistream. Oh no. You all right?
[5028.12s -> 5038.30s]  Wait, what's this? All right, we're doing it. Last one, I promise. The last thing you hear
[5038.30s -> 5047.26s]  is like, I don't understand. I don't get it. No, I hit the brake button. I hit the brake button.
[5049.10s -> 5059.50s]  I hit the brake. Whoa, that's a weird thing. I don't know about that one. That's terrifying.
[5060.14s -> 5093.93s]  Go over the jump. I'm so angry at myself for missing that. Very annoyed at myself. I think
[5094.01s -> 5165.74s]  I got it. I'm almost there. I'm almost there. That was driver one and it was a good one.
[5165.74s -> 5172.63s]  We played that for a little while. It was fun. Worth the wait, I think. But coming up next,
[5173.35s -> 5182.20s]  we've got the land before time racing adventure. This is going to be crazy, I think. This is going
[5182.20s -> 5192.26s]  to be crazy. Oops. Wait, what? Oh, wait, I want to do this. No, I got it. Why did that just happen?
[5192.26s -> 5198.54s]  All right. Finally, it's time for a real game. I mean, driver one is a very popular real game.
[5199.42s -> 5207.11s]  Here we go. Yeah, for the game that I'm playing. Yeah, just leave it as retro. There's no reason
[5207.11s -> 5211.67s]  to change it. They'll be cycling so much. It's not worth it. All right, here we go. Land before time.
[5220.81s -> 5228.65s]  Yeah, I'm on a PS2 right now. PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1. You have a PS2. At least the slim
[5228.65s -> 5234.28s]  model. I don't know. At least the slim model, whatever that means. Is that the one that's
[5234.28s -> 5245.93s]  backwards compatible? Because if you have a PS2 slim, you can play PS1 games in it.
[5248.26s -> 5249.78s]  Are they all backwards compatible? Okay.
[5265.93s -> 5279.45s]  That was wild. Okay. If you gave me a million dollars, I wouldn't be able to name one character.
[5298.68s -> 5304.89s]  This is infomercial music when they're showing off the grill. And introducing the new wave oven.
[5308.34s -> 5322.33s]  Cook. Clean. Store. You need at least one free block in the memory card in slot one. Okay.
[5323.45s -> 5332.63s]  Reading memory card. Land before time. Great balancing adventure. What do I do? Obstacle
[5332.63s -> 5348.09s]  courses. Pick an obstacle course. Free star dash. Rolling hills dash. Dino dash. Stone den dash.
[5348.89s -> 5394.98s]  Right. Ducky. How about either Ducky or Spike? All right, here we go. We're just going. Holy
[5394.98s -> 5399.78s]  shit. This game is awesome. This is like the iPhone run games before they were popular.
[5403.45s -> 5438.09s]  Oops. Oh, I didn't jump. Okay. I'm good. Sorry. Oh my God. Whoa. You can. Okay. You can swim on
[5438.09s -> 5472.25s]  that. What's the time I need to beat? There we go. Ooh. Got it. I think you go faster if you collect
[5472.89s -> 5511.50s]  flowers. I don't know how you do that reliably. I don't understand. Not bad. That wasn't that bad.
[5511.50s -> 5524.68s]  This looks like you if you were nice. Oh, I didn't do it. I think I could do. All right. What about
[5524.68s -> 5532.20s]  this one? What Dino dash? Let's try this one. We'll do Ducky. Maybe they all have different traits.
[5537.40s -> 5550.12s]  140 is what I need. Okay. Well, now I understand what kind of game it is. I didn't know what it
[5550.12s -> 5581.43s]  was before. It's like an auto run game. I don't know. I jumped over it. I think you have to go
[5581.43s -> 5658.58s]  through the middle of those. Yeah. You can't jump over those. I got it. All right. 140. There's more.
[5658.58s -> 5678.20s]  I'm so sorry. I love that harsh audio clipping that you hear. It's like reading memory card. You
[5678.20s -> 5691.05s]  hear that just noise. Oh, okay. I got my unlocked more. All right. Let me get this one then. We'll
[5691.05s -> 5708.41s]  do Sarah. After this, we'll do a race. Can you please drink from a hamster water bottle? No.
[5709.21s -> 5729.61s]  We already went over why that stream would be bad. Why? Because it would be stupid.
[5733.62s -> 5737.70s]  Anytime I ever think of something that we fund or interesting to do on stream for like a show or an
[5737.70s -> 5744.02s]  event, I think about the one thing I think is funny. And then I go, all right, can it be built
[5744.02s -> 5749.78s]  off of that one thing I think is funny? And yeah, me drinking out of a hamster bottle is funny.
[5751.16s -> 5755.40s]  But then imagine the panic I would have to have to fill like three or four hours of a stream
[5756.87s -> 5766.06s]  doing what exactly that's like, I would be in like a hamster costume. I would do the funny. Look,
[5766.06s -> 5773.02s]  I'm drinking out of the thing. And then I'd have a panic attack internally going. What else does
[5773.02s -> 5781.96s]  there do now? Oh my God, this how much does this cost? I would just be like, there's nothing else
[5781.96s -> 5790.63s]  to do. There's nothing else funny. What else is funny that could happen right now? This is bullshit.
[5790.63s -> 5801.27s]  Just walk across it, babe. It would be a one minute stream. It would just be you running in
[5801.27s -> 5817.93s]  the hamster. I would sprint on that hamster wheel and I would trip and I would go. I would fall and
[5817.93s -> 5822.94s]  just kind of be spinning in it. I would just puke. And then the stream would have to turn off and I'd
[5822.94s -> 5842.25s]  get banned for a week. What a fucking terrible stream. All right. How about a windy ridge race?
[5843.61s -> 5884.79s]  Ducky hamster wheel subathon. Oh, no way. Oh my God. I was trying to cut the corner. Get it.
[5890.95s -> 5894.79s]  Why do I? Why is this? Why can I? What song is this?
[5901.19s -> 5912.41s]  What song is this? What is that? This is a real song. Turn around.
[5913.37s -> 5920.38s]  Turn around. Yeah, that's what it is. Okay. Turn around every now and again. I get a little bit
[5920.38s -> 5950.09s]  closer. Turn around. No, it's different now. Play that song. Hold on. He's going to pass me.
[5950.09s -> 5955.45s]  He's going to lap me. Turn around every now and then I get a little bit closer.
[5955.45s -> 5981.83s]  Turn around every now and then I get a little bit more. Is this it?
[6001.82s -> 6005.94s]  That's the joke version? What? What do you mean joke version?
[6006.58s -> 6022.30s]  Why did you link me the joke version? There's a parody version of this song. I linked both.
[6022.30s -> 6027.50s]  Yeah, the first one doesn't work. It says video content unavailable. It's been blocked by display
[6027.50s -> 6045.24s]  on this website. Turn around every now and then I get a little. Just click the link itself. What?
[6045.24s -> 6075.90s]  Is this it? I can't hear it. Yes. When does it say turn around?
[6079.26s -> 6087.56s]  I feel like I feel like there hasn't even been any singing yet.
[6088.12s -> 6097.24s]  It just happened. They're doing it now. Oh, I can't hear it. It's been said three times now.
[6097.24s -> 6105.85s]  All right. Well, whatever. I can't hear it. My headphones are not plugged into my computer.
[6105.85s -> 6120.58s]  They're plugged into the game. All right. Well, I fucking lost. Who cares? Like,
[6120.58s -> 6125.82s]  I'm not going to finish it out. All right. One more. That entire song is him saying,
[6125.82s -> 6146.57s]  turn around a billion times. All right. Let's go. All right. One more. I'm going to win.
[6163.90s -> 6171.40s]  Why are you taking the lead? I did everything perfectly. No, I did everything perfectly.
[6171.40s -> 6197.67s]  It makes no sense. Why are you so fast? What is happening? He's blown by me completely.
[6198.31s -> 6219.93s]  There's a sprint button. There is now that I know that I'll try it again. You suck. I didn't even
[6219.93s -> 6230.70s]  know what the buttons were. OK, 30 minutes. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[6231.26s -> 6295.43s]  Read the manual. There is no manual. Let's go. You stupid. Oh, my God. One little mistake and
[6295.43s -> 6398.62s]  he's so far ahead already. How have I not gotten any ground on it? I have to beat this motherfucker
[6398.62s -> 6405.56s]  so bad. I have to beat this guy. I have to beat him. I have to beat this. I have to beat him.
[6405.56s -> 6423.08s]  I can't move on until I beat him. I'm curious. You look different. Have you had plastic surgery?
[6423.08s -> 6431.90s]  I've not had plastic surgery. No, I've just aged like 12 years. No, I haven't. I haven't gotten
[6431.90s -> 6464.70s]  plastic surgery. Why are you asking that? You took that. I needed it. All right. Stop. He's so far
[6464.70s -> 6471.72s]  ahead already. He didn't even collect any of the flowers. This is horseshit. Oh, my God. I can do
[6471.72s -> 6484.74s]  it. I can do it. I'm going to quiet down. Quiet. We're at a joint. It's been flipping hamburgers
[6484.74s -> 6523.24s]  since 1910. This is Guy Fury music. You know, I come here for the atmosphere. It's always fresh,
[6523.24s -> 6534.70s]  always awesome. Great atmosphere back in the kitchen. Like, I quit. I quit. I need to restart
[6534.70s -> 6551.48s]  it. Craggy cave. I can do it. You got plastic surgery. I'm not going to get plastic surgery.
[6551.48s -> 6555.91s]  I'm not going to get plastic. The only time I've ever thought about getting plastic surgery
[6555.91s -> 6560.63s]  is like maybe fixing my turkey neck eventually. But I don't know. I don't think I'm going to do
[6560.63s -> 6640.25s]  that. I don't have a reason to. Oh, you just got destroyed. Why are you so much faster? Stop.
[6640.25s -> 6651.16s]  I quit. One more time. If you played this music in a room with two people, they would kill each
[6651.16s -> 6663.51s]  other. Why? No, I wouldn't. I actually wouldn't do that. I would go, this music's kind of weird.
[6665.19s -> 6669.30s]  Yeah, I'd like to leave the room now. Who cares?
[6698.25s -> 6701.61s]  This game is fucking impossible. I would have cried if I was a kid playing this.
[6704.41s -> 6753.40s]  I would have cried playing this. Don't pick that up. I want that. How are you right up my ass
[6753.40s -> 6773.16s]  already? How are you this close to me still? Don't lose right now because the music is so funny.
[6774.50s -> 6800.86s]  Go. He's right there. Please die. No, no, I didn't. I didn't say die. I said doi.
[6804.68s -> 6823.24s]  I said doi. Don't touch that. It's mine. Got it. Yes. Oh, thank God. Thank God. I don't have to do
[6823.24s -> 6849.88s]  it again. Thank goodness. That was fun game. How you guys feel? One more. All right. What do we
[6849.88s -> 6853.88s]  got next? Oh, this one's going to be, I feel like I'm going to be in this one for a long time.
[6854.52s -> 6867.00s]  Do I pull that out now? Okay. I'm going to give you guys a choice. We might be in this one for
[6867.00s -> 6882.70s]  a little while. Would you rather see mods make a poll? Oh, okay. The options are
[6884.25s -> 6895.91s]  Hey guys. Damn. Countdown. Countdown vampires or the golden nugget video game. It's a casino game.
[6896.87s -> 6904.84s]  And there's apparently 30 minutes of live action. Adam West video. I don't know what that means. I
[6904.84s -> 6912.60s]  just know that it's in the game. I don't know what that means. I mean, we're going to play in
[6912.60s -> 6927.06s]  both, but which one do you want first? I don't think it's even close. Golden nugget casino game
[6927.14s -> 6938.10s]  or countdown vampires. All right. It's not even remotely close. That was fun. That was actually
[6938.10s -> 6953.56s]  really cute. It was land before time adventure racing. I think this is two discs. Yeah. Two
[6953.56s -> 6958.12s]  discs. I'm going to have to put discs in to load up cut scenes. I bet it's going to be a disaster.
[6958.84s -> 6979.62s]  Let's try. Here comes the golden nugget video game. 81%. Oh my God. That's a lot. That's actually an
[6979.62s -> 7016.52s]  unbelievable number. Okay. Let's go. No casino game will ever be like Vegas steaks. Sure about
[7016.52s -> 7075.42s]  that. Okay. Is that me in the limo? Going to Las Vegas. The window going to roll down. Is it
[7075.42s -> 7124.50s]  going to be Adam West? Pull it up to the golden nugget. Is it one person? Okay. Let's go. It looks
[7124.50s -> 7131.78s]  like chocolate. Start or options? I mean, what could the options be? Background, sound effects,
[7131.78s -> 7137.45s]  computer players on card animation. I guess we're just keeping it the way it is. Okay. Let's go.
[7138.01s -> 7162.62s]  Let's do it. Welcome to the fabulous golden nugget. Visit the registration desk. Do I have to? Oh,
[7162.62s -> 7169.00s]  no. If you haven't saved your game yet, your current game will be lost. Steve. What's my name?
[7169.00s -> 7208.25s]  Steve Killsberg. Steve Killsberg. Killsberg. What do? Okay. I need a new name. How much money do I
[7208.25s -> 7222.30s]  have? Where's my money? What is that thing? What is it? What did I just click on? Oh shit. Maximum
[7222.30s -> 7229.62s]  bit of thousand. How much money do I have? 50, 20, 10. I have like 200 bucks. How much money do I
[7229.62s -> 7245.61s]  have? Go forward. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. You know, all right. Blackjack. Let's start with Blackjack.
[7245.61s -> 7251.69s]  Go all in. Okay. I'll go all in on the first hand. I don't even know what, do I have to put a dollar
[7251.69s -> 7271.82s]  up? Okay. How much did I just bet? Stand. Did I say that? What do I have here? 13 is four. Stand.
[7275.22s -> 7295.06s]  All right. How much money did I just bet? How much money am I betting? Oh shit. There we go. Okay.
[7295.06s -> 7303.78s]  Nine versus king. Oh, hit. I'm busted. Sorry. Sorry to hear that. I'll take a card. That's not good.
[7303.78s -> 7317.34s]  Stand. All right. Hey, look at that. Is that 500? What just happened? Wait, what's going on here?
[7317.34s -> 7329.24s]  What just happened? What's going on? What's happening? Oh shit. That was 500. All right.
[7329.24s -> 7345.21s]  I got it. I got it. All right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right. Jack. Oh, 13 versus an eight.
[7347.35s -> 7355.96s]  16 versus eight. I have to take another card. 22. Hit. Hit me. I'm busted. All right. That's all
[7355.96s -> 7364.04s]  right. Sorry. I lose anyways. I would have lost anyways. All right. One more. How much money do I
[7364.04s -> 7372.94s]  have? All right. I have to stop after this. Let's see an ace right there. Perfect. Perfect. Blackjack.
[7376.84s -> 7390.49s]  Nice. What? Oh, that's fucking stupid. I have no money left. It's over.
[7391.21s -> 7403.35s]  Let's not stand. We're in. Stand. 15. There it is. We're back. How to pronounce stand in English.
[7405.19s -> 7432.25s]  Stand. Why do I have zero dollars? Okay. And here's the question. Stand. Yes.
[7434.89s -> 7444.04s]  Stand. Is that I win, right? Did I win? What is that? How much did I win? Seven. 14.
[7445.40s -> 7457.43s]  You fucking piece of shit game. What? A 21 again? What happens if I have no money? Oh, I have
[7457.43s -> 7468.54s]  special. I have markers. Okay. All right. Cool. That bet is over the table maximum.
[7473.18s -> 7489.50s]  I guess I'll do 5,000 then. I only won twice. Whatever. It's okay. It's all right. It's all
[7489.50s -> 7500.71s]  right. What do we got here? Roulette. Slots. All right. Slots. We'll just do slots. We'll do
[7500.71s -> 7507.26s]  slots. We'll go to Eureka. Where is Adam West? I don't know. It says this is like an hour of
[7507.26s -> 7520.79s]  footage. All right. This is one dollar. Okay. How do I, how do I, I don't want to bet $5,000.
[7521.59s -> 7539.29s]  How do I get rid of that? How do I do this? I can't click spin. I can't click bet.
[7539.93s -> 7547.56s]  I can't hit. Oh, okay. Well, there we go. All right. Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. Oh.
[7549.16s -> 7572.31s]  How much money am I putting in? Okay. Let's do a hundred. I hope Adam West like bumps into me.
[7572.31s -> 7585.53s]  It just dumps a drink on me or something. Okay. So that's about $500. Why are there dynamite?
[7585.53s -> 7593.98s]  Why is it spinning again? Why is it doing this? What's happening? Why is it doing this? I'm not
[7593.98s -> 7624.66s]  doing this. What's going on? Why is it doing this? I have a hundred credits still. Why? I didn't say
[7624.66s -> 7647.67s]  I'm spending money. That was one spin. I'm so confused. I don't know what just happened.
[7647.67s -> 7667.98s]  All right. Come on. Come on. Was that food and scrambled eggs? Gold, gold. Oh, five. I'll take
[7667.98s -> 7697.59s]  it. Three. Oh, that's when we leave. All right. Take it out. 6,125. Let's go. All right. Nice. Okay.
[7697.59s -> 7705.18s]  That's good. Look at that. I have one hundred. That's it. I feel like I've spent a lot. Play
[7705.18s -> 7733.06s]  story mode. Isn't, am I not doing story mode? This is story mode. How do I do story mode? I think,
[7733.06s -> 7746.34s]  I think we're okay. That's one guy. All right. How about, how about roulette? Where's roulette?
[7746.34s -> 7758.79s]  Right here. You didn't tweet your stream on. Oh, shit. Sorry. Okay. Let me show you my roulette
[7758.79s -> 7769.46s]  strategy. I don't want that much. How do I get rid of that? All right. So was it, I'm doing a hundred,
[7769.46s -> 7776.49s]  I'm doing two hundred bucks. Not this much, but you know what I mean. Two hundred dollars is going
[7776.49s -> 7782.02s]  where I would do in a corner bet right here. But this is four hundred bucks, right? So I need 11,
[7782.02s -> 7800.26s]  12, 14, 15, 17, 18. Let's go. All right. Let's do it. I'm ready. Spin it. All right. Go. Okay.
[7802.20s -> 7818.78s]  I came to see what it is. Eleven. How much is that? How much did I just win? That was
[7818.78s -> 7824.78s]  two hundred. That's two hundred times. That's a lot. That's two hundred, eight, four to one,
[7824.78s -> 7847.45s]  eight to one. Look at that. That bet is over the table. Oh, you don't know who I am. All right.
[7847.45s -> 7862.07s]  A thousand on red. Go. Where's Adam West? He's going to show up. You need to do story mode.
[7862.07s -> 7881.67s]  Story mode is the other disc. Winner. What? Golden Nugget features a mystery themed story mode.
[7881.67s -> 7887.67s]  What? This is disc one. Wait, are you serious? How do I do that? I want to do that right now.
[7896.01s -> 7906.20s]  There's another disc here. I want to play the mystery mode. Start a new file and select mystery
[7906.20s -> 7921.80s]  mode. You didn't even say that. There's a murder mystery or something. I need to do it. We have
[7921.80s -> 7939.42s]  that. We have to do this. Where's the lobby? No, I don't want to play crap. PlayStation version
[7939.42s -> 7947.54s]  was released on two separate discs with one containing the game story mode. So maybe maybe
[7947.54s -> 7958.65s]  that's accurate. Maybe it is on the other disc. OK, let's try that. Registration new. Let's see
[7958.65s -> 7968.70s]  if it does it here. Did you get a coupon in here? I don't think so. New. Oh, cause chaos
[7968.70s -> 7982.62s]  mystery. Chaos mystery mode. Are you kidding me? This is chaos mode. Let's go. This is it.
[7995.77s -> 7999.45s]  Chaos theory and you.
[8019.58s -> 8026.62s]  We see the formation of a cloud, the clustering of stars. Mountains aren't cones.
[8027.42s -> 8034.06s]  Clouds aren't spheres. The world is made of zigs and zags, random,
[8034.06s -> 8044.65s]  radical yet deep inside the chaos looks an even eerier order. And the key to this world exists.
[8045.61s -> 8053.50s]  Now the chaos chip, the chaos chip proper interface. This new microprocessor will
[8053.50s -> 8063.56s]  compute outcomes using data compiled sheerly from nature's weather patterns, life expectancy.
[8065.16s -> 8075.19s]  What role of a die turn? We could just play cards to, you know, what happened?
[8075.67s -> 8079.85s]  Well, at best guess, I'd say this computer your company makes has a bit of a bad motivator.
[8082.09s -> 8085.69s]  No big words, but they'll fund you. I'm sure they will after the card tricks.
[8087.45s -> 8091.45s]  He exposed tomorrow. It's not like I have time to predict the presidential election.
[8092.65s -> 8098.73s]  Maybe try walking on hot coals. That was last year. Not gonna answer the door. Somebody's
[8098.73s -> 8105.21s]  at the door, sweetie. Can I see any few? You expecting company? I haven't spoken to Steven
[8105.21s -> 8108.81s]  in six years. I had no idea he was going to be here at the same time.
[8112.49s -> 8118.14s]  You know, that's him at your little poker rondeley tomorrow. Won't you?
[8119.34s -> 8144.81s]  It's an invitational. First off, chaos indeed. Chaos. What is up? Oh, Dr. Harkness, I presume
[8146.68s -> 8155.61s]  shock or quick movements, please. Just the chip now. Chip the chaos one, the one you designed its
[8155.61s -> 8167.45s]  location. Who are you? Call me Shirako, but quietly. We don't want to wake the neighbors. Get it. I
[8167.45s -> 8194.90s]  actually don't. Get him to him. Where is it? I thought I hit her right in the head. I thought
[8194.90s -> 8202.42s]  I hit her directly in the head. It was like, holy shit. What is this? This is just a spray painted
[8202.42s -> 8226.42s]  shoe box. He's gone. So where is the mystery chip? I have a theory. I'll tell you in a minute. Steven,
[8226.98s -> 8233.16s]  it's me. Look, don't say anything. I know that it's been forever and we didn't part on the
[8233.16s -> 8240.68s]  greatest of terms, but I need your help. I'm in a real mess. I'm here to write the golden nugget.
[8242.76s -> 8249.32s]  I hope your poker skills are intact. Just listen, I don't have much time. Someone stole something
[8249.32s -> 8254.58s]  very important from my hotel room. It's a microchip. It's a processor that.
[8255.38s -> 8260.26s]  Trust me. I puke up cards. Am I like a monster like person? Why am I puke? Why am I throwing
[8260.26s -> 8265.38s]  a card? They left something behind in my hotel room. It's a registration form for the poker
[8265.38s -> 8272.02s]  tournament. So writing on the back, I can't quite make out. Anyway, whoever it is might still play.
[8272.02s -> 8280.25s]  And if you could just, I don't know. Don't leave it there. Ben's around here somewhere.
[8281.48s -> 8286.31s]  Maybe you could find my friend, Melanie. Why can't you just give it to me? Sorry, I'm still so high
[8286.31s -> 8313.13s]  maintenance, Stevie. I'll talk to you when I can. Okay. Sexy scientist super invention stolen. But
[8313.21s -> 8323.54s]  wait, wait, wait, you will need to have $20,000 to enter the poker team. Why does that headline
[8323.54s -> 8334.71s]  have to say sexy? That's bizarre. What the fuck is the point of that? Okay. I have a theory.
[8334.71s -> 8342.84s]  The theory that I have is that the golden nugget, I mean, these casinos rake in billions.
[8342.84s -> 8346.68s]  And I'm imagining that they probably had a hundred million dollar budget for this game.
[8347.74s -> 8353.50s]  And the developers and coders were like, okay, we made Blackjack, we made Keno, and we did poker,
[8354.06s -> 8358.63s]  or we're done. What do you mean you're done? Yeah, we're done. We finished the game. It's just like
[8358.63s -> 8363.21s]  Blackjack and shit. There's like a million of these apps. There are 100 million of these on the app
[8363.21s -> 8369.06s]  store on disk. There's so many of them. Oh, well, just take the other 98 million and make a movie
[8369.06s -> 8378.74s]  with Adam West. Why? That sounds like a bad idea. Just do it. Do it. Just spend the other like 75
[8378.74s -> 8386.36s]  million. It's just that. All right. I'm in. I'm in long term, by the way. I need $20,000.
[8387.91s -> 8395.21s]  Got to make this happen. The apps are in the nineties. All right. We got to get to 20K. How
[8395.21s -> 8411.40s]  much do I have right now? I have 10,000. We need to go register. I need to save the game. All right.
[8411.40s -> 8425.75s]  Save it right there. I'm ready. SpongeBob music. Go 10K. Put it all on black. All right. Let's see
[8425.75s -> 8436.62s]  if I can do it. No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me go to Blackjack. Come on. All right.
[8440.01s -> 8446.73s]  I know I don't want to do a $5 bet. No, I want to do more than that. Hit stand.
[8447.53s -> 8457.02s]  Not up. Hey, we're good. Hit me. Hit. I'm busted. I would have won that too.
[8457.98s -> 8470.04s]  I actually annoying. All right. How about 2252? How about 500 per hand? You guys are okay with
[8470.04s -> 8482.76s]  that? 500 per hand. I lost 500. That's, that's a terrible start. Stand versus four. Stand. Stand.
[8496.28s -> 8502.95s]  17 versus the king. I hate this. I don't want to. I don't, I hate hitting this. I don't want to hit
[8502.95s -> 8513.32s]  this. Stand on 13 versus four. Yeah. Sometimes I have to do it. 21. Oh my God. Hit me. I'm busted.
[8514.04s -> 8528.66s]  We're good. What is making that sound? You hear that? Okay. We got to go for it.
[8528.66s -> 8543.37s]  Thousand. Can we, this person gets Blackjack. Hit. Can we switch seats? Stand. Shit. A 16.
[8547.34s -> 8581.78s]  You're over Blackjack. Hit me. 15 versus nine. This sucks. You're over. Fuck you. Come on. Stand.
[8583.16s -> 8593.91s]  12 versus six. No. Stand. See. We're good. All right. We're coming back. We're coming back.
[8600.25s -> 8606.73s]  There it is. Hit. Hit me. Hit me. I'm busted. Dude, what are you doing? Hit me. Stand.
[8607.29s -> 8612.79s]  Let's take a Blackjack. All right. We're up. We're up. 500.
[8613.35s -> 8622.58s]  Okay. We're on a streak. Let's go. Can I split? Stand. Can I split? Do you wish to split?
[8623.38s -> 8630.36s]  Against a nine. That's a terrible idea. Should I do it? Or split? Split eights every time. No. No.
[8630.36s -> 8636.86s]  No. It's terrible. It's horrible. It's a terrible idea. Versus a nine. You're trying to lose twice?
[8637.82s -> 8643.90s]  Always split. Are you trying to lose twice? Always split eights. You're trying to lose twice?
[8648.06s -> 8676.10s]  That's fucking awful. Hit it again. No. Hit me. I'm busted. Hey, guy. Hey, you know what I say.
[8676.10s -> 8688.47s]  Always split eights. Always split eights. See, that's what I say. All right. One more and I'm out.
[8692.54s -> 8702.76s]  Stand. Get out of here. Hit me. Stand. Oh, sorry. Somebody busted. And that's now I'm at.
[8702.76s -> 8725.80s]  I'm getting close to 13K. 13K. I want to. Should I stay? It's a hot table. Hit. Stand. It's versus
[8725.80s -> 8729.80s]  seven, but I'm going for the double. Let's go. This is double down right here. 11. Let's go.
[8729.80s -> 8741.62s]  Give me a 10. Stand. Yes. I had to count for a second. There it is. Come on. 15. We're almost
[8741.62s -> 8745.91s]  there. You're addicted. I'm not addicted. I'm playing the story mode. I have to figure out
[8745.91s -> 8763.66s]  what the chaos chip is and I need 20,000 for it. Stand. Good. Hit. Stand. Yes. All right. I have
[8763.66s -> 8777.91s]  to be close. I'm at 16. I'm getting up. I'm getting up. That's a $6,500 profit right now.
[8777.91s -> 8789.19s]  All right. Now don't lose it. Roulette. No, maybe sit down and back her up. You need to be a VIP
[8789.19s -> 8797.59s]  club member before you can visit a high limit area. You have at least $50,000. What? No,
[8797.59s -> 8805.13s]  maybe play back her up. Go save it. How do you even play Kino? I don't know how you play.
[8810.73s -> 8833.67s]  Big six. Save the game. I will after this. What is this? How do you play big six? Put it on 10?
[8834.55s -> 8845.27s]  No more bets. What is this? Oh, it's the big, it's the scam wheel.
[8846.39s -> 8860.95s]  Yeah, that's the worst thing to play in the whole casino. All right. I need to go to the lobby. I
[8860.95s -> 8878.01s]  got to save it. We're so close. Where's the lobby? All right. Save the game. We're good. 15, nine.
[8880.81s -> 8890.49s]  Okay. I need 20 K and then after 20, yeah, you need 20 K to enter the first poker tournament.
[8890.49s -> 8895.34s]  I don't, I don't, I'm not good at poker. I like to play it sometimes.
[8895.34s -> 8901.00s]  Dude, this game came out on the app store and I'm not even kidding. It's so awesome.
[8901.88s -> 8906.04s]  Uh, what's it called? I'm, I'm seriously go get it right now. If you think like
[8906.04s -> 8914.81s]  poker is fun, it's a poker slash Yahtzee combo. It's Yahtzee, but poker and you deal your own
[8914.81s -> 8919.45s]  hands and you got to make this the it's like Yahtzee. It's really cool. It's what is it called?

[9123.50s -> 9127.67s]  It's addicting. It's fun. It's just like a solo, just poker game. You play with your,
[9127.67s -> 9133.90s]  you play with yourself and it's like Yahtzee. It's like four bucks. That's it. All right. Let's go.

[9224.06s -> 9230.10s]  No more bets, please. Pine tar is just poker. It's poker and Yahtzee combined.
[9230.18s -> 9250.30s]  You didn't even download it. You didn't even download it. Nine red shit. All right. Come on.
[9250.30s -> 9256.62s]  These are easy bets. No more bets, please. Thousand on black. Come on. It's not a scam.

[9359.26s -> 9365.54s]  red. All right. I have. You've made it into the first poker tournament. There's no time to waste.
[9365.54s -> 9378.30s]  So hurry to the poker suite before they start without you. Let's go. Welcome Mr. Kills Bird.
[9378.30s -> 9385.88s]  I'm glad you could make it. My dear sir, there simply are no vacancies. I find no record of
[9385.88s -> 9392.92s]  your reservation whatsoever. Look, I'll pay you anything reasonable. Come on. What do you say?
[9392.92s -> 9397.24s]  Is this the poker room? Look, may as well let the white shirt in. Do Shelley's late anyway.
[9397.24s -> 9404.12s]  Give him Henry's spot. Too late. It's already mine. If I may be of assistance,
[9409.43s -> 9416.57s]  Mr. Swain. Mr. Farland may have my seat for the first just. It seems I have business elsewhere.
[9416.57s -> 9424.18s]  There you go. Well, well. Who are we? Kills Bird. Shelley's told me so much about you. My name's
[9424.18s -> 9430.58s]  Swain, but anybody who knows me from Adam calls me Hugh. I gathered from your body language that
[9430.58s -> 9437.14s]  you're a left-handed card player. A little disconcerting since I see that you've neglected
[9437.14s -> 9443.94s]  the laces on your right shoe. A stress level that could only be related to the jitters before
[9445.06s -> 9451.46s]  a high stakes game of chance or to the comments I overheard this morning from a young woman
[9451.46s -> 9457.30s]  at the pay phones downstairs since she called her speaker, Stevie. This is fucking awesome.
[9458.26s -> 9470.50s]  It can only be assumed that you're he and here for her. Or one of us has become vaguely confused.
[9472.07s -> 9477.93s]  Though my suspicions perhaps sound deranged to the common ear, I think there's more to this
[9477.93s -> 9484.09s]  friendly game of chance than meets the eye. You keep that eye on your opponents. Mr. Garth's not
[9484.09s -> 9491.18s]  lit. I'll be in touch. It's your turn at that. Mr. Mr. Slane, I'm just the pizza guy.
[9492.54s -> 9495.50s]  Can you sign for this or? I don't know what you're talking about.
[9497.06s -> 9501.86s]  Gentlemen, ladies, welcome to the Golden Nugget and this year's preliminary poker
[9501.86s -> 9506.58s]  invitational. Beginning on my right, please state the names by which you wish to be known.
[9507.22s -> 9512.90s]  I'm Joanna Kurtz. Hello, everyone. Ben Farland. Great to be surrounded by all of you,
[9513.78s -> 9520.02s]  especially the famous Mr. Kilzberg, who needs no introduction. You're a weird guy. Mr. Farland,
[9520.66s -> 9525.46s]  Mr. Kilzberg, welcome. Wait, we can't introduce ourselves? Short for Tracy.
[9526.18s -> 9534.18s]  Serako, if anything. Sheila Warwick. Call me whatever you like, within reason. Thank you all.
[9535.48s -> 9542.66s]  Let's get started. All right, here we go. I can't fuck this up. This is a big poker tournament.
[9542.98s -> 9556.46s]  Oh, this is not high. What? Oh, everybody, it's time for the billionaires to play with $25 a hand.
[9556.46s -> 9577.00s]  What the fuck is this? How do you play poker? What kind of poker is this? I don't know what
[9577.00s -> 9582.12s]  we're playing. What kind of poker is this? What's that mean? I raise. I don't know what's going on.
[9582.12s -> 9589.35s]  I call. I'm out. I don't know what's happening. You may vote, call or raise. I got queen high.
[9590.23s -> 9593.91s]  What kind of poker is this? Is it Texas Hold'em? Five card draw?
[9594.87s -> 9603.56s]  Because I mean queen high, that's pretty good, right? I will raise. I call. I'm out. I call.
[9603.56s -> 9618.52s]  I call. I call. Can we see other cards? Okay, so now what? I check. You may check or bet. I
[9618.52s -> 9625.48s]  don't know what that means. This is a pretty good hand. It's a pretty good hand. It's five
[9625.48s -> 9636.42s]  card stud. Okay. I got queen ten suited. Pretty good. Check. I bet. I call. I call. I call. I raise.

[9697.37s -> 9711.16s]  Is it seven card stud? Uh oh. I raise. I think I got a queen under there. I call. I call. You may
[9711.16s -> 9718.36s]  vote, call or raise. I call. I've got a queen. Flip that queen. I'm gonna flip a queen. Watch this.
[9719.75s -> 9730.41s]  Flipping a queen. Boom. You may vote, call or raise. I raise. I raise. I call. I call. You may vote,
[9730.41s -> 9740.95s]  call or raise. I call. Flipping a queen. I win. I'm getting too close to this guy's cards.
[9741.51s -> 9757.56s]  What are my cards? Where are my cards? I don't get to show my cards? Where are they?
[9758.12s -> 9769.27s]  You had nothing. You ate them. You dropped your hand on the ground.
[9772.07s -> 9787.56s]  Deal. I guess I lost but I didn't even see what I had for a hand. Okay. I'm out. Already?
[9788.65s -> 9793.93s]  I raise. I'm out. Why? You can't even see what you have. You have a queen high. I'm out. What are
[9793.93s -> 9800.95s]  they doing? You may vote, call or raise. It's just me and the guy with the king. Let's go. Raise. I call.
[9800.95s -> 9814.76s]  I call. I call. Give me a jack. Oh. I check. Okay. I check. Not bad. You may check or bet.

[9867.64s -> 9892.17s]  What do I have? Two queens. I'm out. You fucking have aces under there. What? I want to go see
[9892.17s -> 9902.09s]  Adam West again. I call. I'm out. I call. You may vote, call or raise. I mean everybody kind of
[9902.09s -> 9921.10s]  has a shitty hand so I might as well. I call. I'm out. I call. I call. I check. I check. You would.
[9921.74s -> 9936.12s]  You may check or bet. The hearts. I check. I can't believe we're doing $25 hand. You may vote,

[9942.70s -> 9957.77s]  straight call. I call. You may vote, call or raise. I call. You may vote, call or raise.
[9958.41s -> 9970.01s]  God, look at this bullshit. You sure you can't look at the flipped cards?

[10022.66s -> 10027.78s]  Look, it's kind of quiet. Look over, like Adam West just sleeping on that couch.
[10030.34s -> 10035.06s]  Yeah, he had all that shit to say and he's kind of taking a nap. I raise. I raise. You may vote,
[10035.06s -> 10046.47s]  call or raise. Well, the King Queen Jack, that's, I can't beat that. What the fuck is that? I call.
[10046.47s -> 10064.15s]  I call. I call. I call. I call. How long do you sit here for to do this? I raise. I raise. I call.
[10064.15s -> 10071.29s]  I call. I have Jack, Queen, 10. Is that a 9? Dude, I'm close. Is that a 6? No, it's a, wait, shit.
[10071.29s -> 10085.46s]  Is that a 9 or is it a 6? I call. I call. I call. I call. I call. Let's go. Come on. Let me,
[10085.46s -> 10098.38s]  let me get this big pot here to nine, nine, 10, come on. Give me straight. I raise. I raise. I call.
[10098.38s -> 10105.02s]  I call. I call. You have one pair. You may vote, call, or raise. I call. I call. I call. I call.
[10105.02s -> 10108.41s]  This is a big pot. Give it to me.
[10108.41s -> 10110.78s]  Give me the straight.
[10110.78s -> 10113.38s]  Do it. Come on.
[10113.38s -> 10115.82s]  I'm out.
[10115.82s -> 10117.82s]  Five, six, what is it?
[10117.82s -> 10120.76s]  I'm out. What do I have?
[10120.76s -> 10124.22s]  I'm out.
[10124.22s -> 10128.76s]  Did I win?
[10128.76s -> 10130.76s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a brief intermission.
[10130.76s -> 10141.96s]  Did I win?
[10141.96s -> 10146.10s]  Excuse me.
[10146.10s -> 10148.10s]  It would seem the waters run deeper than I feared.
[10148.10s -> 10150.10s]  Perhaps I should elaborate in our last conversation.
[10150.10s -> 10152.10s]  No doubt you found it
[10152.10s -> 10154.47s]  Puzzling.
[10154.47s -> 10156.47s]  You see, I was unwinding at the tables earlier.
[10156.47s -> 10158.47s]  His cigar is bigger.
[10158.47s -> 10160.47s]  His cigar grows when he tells a lie.
[10160.47s -> 10162.47s]  As always, when in a large room
[10162.47s -> 10164.47s]  filled with a symphony of hundreds of people
[10164.47s -> 10166.47s]  engaged in hypnotic entertainment,
[10166.47s -> 10168.47s]  I found myself lip reading.
[10168.47s -> 10170.78s]  Immediately I recognized
[10170.78s -> 10172.78s]  the renowned chaos theorist
[10172.78s -> 10174.78s]  from today's front page.
[10174.78s -> 10176.78s]  Yet though wracked with guilt
[10176.78s -> 10178.78s]  for my invasion of her privacy,
[10178.78s -> 10180.78s]  I soon noticed I wasn't the only one
[10180.78s -> 10182.78s]  paying attention to a beautiful celebrity
[10182.78s -> 10184.78s]  on the verge of collapse.
[10186.78s -> 10193.29s]  Ed, Edd and Eddie?
[10193.29s -> 10195.29s]  It's Ed, Edd and Eddie music.
[10195.29s -> 10206.17s]  Until that moment,
[10206.17s -> 10208.17s]  my main reason for visiting the Golden Nugget
[10208.17s -> 10210.17s]  had been the hope of winning enough to...
[10210.17s -> 10212.17s]  Well, let's just say I drive a guzzler
[10212.17s -> 10214.17s]  and have a charming collection of pads.
[10216.17s -> 10218.17s]  But suddenly I knew a storm was gathering
[10218.17s -> 10220.79s]  and this scrap of paper
[10220.79s -> 10222.79s]  began to look like the
[10222.79s -> 10225.22s]  only umbrella
[10225.22s -> 10227.46s]  of the entire western state
[10227.46s -> 10230.22s]  since we last spoke.
[10230.22s -> 10233.35s]  I examined this
[10233.35s -> 10235.35s]  telltale tatter using
[10235.35s -> 10237.35s]  what few items in my crime lab
[10237.35s -> 10239.35s]  I had time to pack in my duct tape.
[10239.35s -> 10241.35s]  Although encrypted
[10241.35s -> 10243.35s]  in pig latin,
[10243.35s -> 10245.59s]  I deciphered this curious phrase
[10245.59s -> 10247.59s]  written on the back in fresh black ink.
[10247.59s -> 10249.59s]  Why was six
[10249.59s -> 10251.59s]  afraid of seven?
[10251.59s -> 10253.59s]  Signed, bullets over kings.
[10253.59s -> 10255.59s]  He's making stuff.
[10255.59s -> 10257.59s]  I'll run this through the computer, you keep an eye out here.
[10257.59s -> 10259.59s]  The fiend who taunts us with these
[10259.59s -> 10261.59s]  dastardly rib ticklers.
[10261.59s -> 10263.59s]  This guy's a weirdo.
[10263.59s -> 10265.59s]  That's a CVS receipt for one coconut water.
[10267.59s -> 10269.59s]  Keep them clueless, casually.
[10269.59s -> 10271.96s]  No, save your questions
[10271.96s -> 10273.96s]  till later. I'm in motion.
[10273.96s -> 10281.77s]  Can we get you anything,
[10281.77s -> 10283.77s]  Mr. Kilzberg?
[10283.77s -> 10286.07s]  Yes. I would like.
[10286.07s -> 10288.07s]  Wasn't Mr. Swain with you
[10288.07s -> 10290.07s]  a moment ago?
[10290.07s -> 10298.26s]  No, no, it was a different guy.
[10298.26s -> 10300.26s]  That was a different guy.
[10300.26s -> 10302.26s]  Alright, here we go. I gotta keep this going.
[10302.26s -> 10307.96s]  I gotta keep it going. I can't just go to zero.
[10307.96s -> 10317.88s]  We gotta see how this plays out.
[10317.88s -> 10319.88s]  You may vote, call, or raise.
[10319.88s -> 10326.66s]  Hmm.
[10326.66s -> 10328.66s]  Yeah, two jacks, two eights, two pair, no way.
[10328.66s -> 10331.67s]  I would've lost.
[10331.67s -> 10335.64s]  Resident sleeper gameplay.
[10335.64s -> 10341.27s]  Get back to the cut scene.
[10341.27s -> 10343.27s]  I raise. I call.
[10343.27s -> 10345.27s]  Everybody's got good shit to start.
[10345.27s -> 10347.27s]  I call.
[10347.27s -> 10349.90s]  I'm out.
[10349.90s -> 10351.90s]  Ask for the beer plus milk.
[10351.90s -> 10355.86s]  I call.
[10355.86s -> 10357.86s]  It's been six hours. It hadn't even been three.
[10357.86s -> 10363.30s]  Alright.
[10363.30s -> 10365.30s]  I check.
[10365.30s -> 10367.48s]  You may check or bet.
[10367.48s -> 10369.48s]  Uh, whatever.
[10369.48s -> 10371.48s]  I call.
[10371.48s -> 10373.48s]  I raise.
[10373.48s -> 10375.48s]  Just watch the cut scenes on YouTube.
[10375.48s -> 10377.48s]  No, I need to earn it.
[10377.48s -> 10380.30s]  I call.
[10380.30s -> 10382.30s]  I call.
[10382.30s -> 10392.86s]  That's not bad.
[10392.86s -> 10394.86s]  You may vote, call, or raise.
[10394.86s -> 10396.86s]  I call.
[10396.86s -> 10398.86s]  I call.
[10398.86s -> 10401.10s]  Please, we want to see Spyro.
[10401.10s -> 10403.10s]  What makes you think I have Spyro here right now?
[10403.10s -> 10408.09s]  I don't have Spyro.
[10408.09s -> 10410.09s]  I raise.
[10410.09s -> 10412.09s]  You may vote, call, or raise.
[10412.09s -> 10414.09s]  I call.

[10416.39s -> 10418.39s]  I think I played Spyro already.
[10418.39s -> 10425.74s]  A long time ago.
[10425.74s -> 10427.74s]  I raise.
[10427.74s -> 10429.74s]  You may vote, call, or raise.
[10429.74s -> 10431.74s]  I call.
[10431.74s -> 10433.74s]  Just cancel the stream. There's no Spyro.
[10433.74s -> 10438.01s]  Alright, flip it.

[10459.40s -> 10461.40s]  You may vote, call, or raise.
[10461.40s -> 10464.41s]  We're not in a rush.

[10492.42s -> 10494.73s]  What are you talking about?
[10494.73s -> 10496.73s]  Are you lying down in the hospital bed?

[10633.48s -> 10636.54s]  He's in town to unveil his new Adam's smash for tomorrow's expo
[10637.84s -> 10641.48s]  Personally, I've never understood any of the stuff his company makes
[10642.00s -> 10644.00s]  Ram wrong
[10644.04s -> 10648.20s]  It's all geek to me. So he gave me a little pocket change

[10677.42s -> 10679.42s]  Girl's father used to work for me
[10680.06s -> 10685.74s]  But the cool thing about the backstab is you only need that one good

[10696.02s -> 10697.38s]  tycoon

[11884.02s -> 11889.14s]  There is nothing worse than tank controls
[11889.74s -> 11914.66s]  Nothing on this earth. How do I get out of here get up the stairs? Oh

[12066.55s -> 12071.33s]  You're probably gonna be like dude. What the fuck fuck you right? But just let me this is my opinion about video games
[12071.35s -> 12077.03s]  This is my personal video game opinion. And all I have to say is I don't like the old Resident Evil games
[12077.03s -> 12082.82s]  I think they're awful and I thought that when they came out as they came out during a period where I that was like a new
[12082.82s -> 12083.86s]  thing
[12083.86s -> 12087.41s]  Like when the Resident Evil games were a big deal
[12087.61s -> 12092.17s]  They were just barely releasing and I was part of that group that thought
[12092.93s -> 12102.35s]  And I do I did not like them and those are like the best of the best in this genre of tank controlled games
[12102.39s -> 12106.03s]  I don't think I'm gonna like this one very much at all
[12112.70s -> 12117.35s]  Resident Evil 4 is this does not count. I'm talking about Resident Evil 1 Resident Evil 2
[12117.83s -> 12122.47s]  Although I did I did enjoy them. I did play them. I did
[12123.03s -> 12125.87s]  Eventually, but I never was a fan of the
[12127.43s -> 12129.93s]  Okay, let me figure that I'm gonna figure this out
[12130.17s -> 12136.81s]  That's a zoomer opinion. No, it's not. I just don't like tank control games. It's driving crazy
[12137.17s -> 12143.06s]  All right anesthetic stun gun and after they're on to pour some water on them and I don't do I have white water
[12145.09s -> 12147.45s]  stun globe anesthetic dart I
[12148.57s -> 12160.91s]  Don't have white weight white water is in the corner. How do I use it? How do I use them? How do I use the water?
[12174.43s -> 12211.04s]  How do I pour the water on them doesn't help what action
[12212.46s -> 12215.27s]  Change weapon
[12215.43s -> 12220.04s]  Wait, what's that?
[12226.73s -> 12233.90s]  Like how do you pour water on them?
[12243.56s -> 12281.35s]  Ready are you though?
[12281.51s -> 12288.36s]  Bionicles going in ps2 Bionicle for ps2 going in now
[12288.36s -> 12296.89s]  I mean that was worth playing just to get that opening cutscene. That was great
[12301.86s -> 12322.66s]  Eidos really
[12322.66s -> 12333.60s]  This looks fucking awesome
[12333.60s -> 12376.70s]  But her that was a very long intro take two ice the movie starting everybody quiet
[12420.48s -> 12422.48s]  And
[12423.08s -> 12430.68s]  It's transformed all the islands inhabitants into all kinds of strange spiteful creatures
[12434.68s -> 12444.47s]  You must track that beat the Piraka to return boy, and we to peace
[12445.87s -> 12451.03s]  Use the powers that the masks will grant you to say boy, and we
[12451.03s -> 12453.03s]  I
[12466.35s -> 12468.35s]  Onicle heroes, I'm ready
[12469.31s -> 12488.35s]  I'm prepared. It's travelers tales. They make the Lego games really this still this still kicking, huh? That's pretty cool
[12488.59s -> 12516.15s]  All right, I'm ready. I know a lot of people were looking forward to this. Oh the bloom is
[12516.95s -> 12519.60s]  unbelievable
[12519.60s -> 12543.74s]  The whole game is a bloom filter enter shop. Whoa, what is all this? All right, I gotta go do a mission zone select
[12554.10s -> 12564.67s]  There's ox coastline. I think that's the only one I can do right. Let's go. You need 3d glasses
[12565.19s -> 12578.49s]  It really is like the Lego games, isn't it? I could turn scan lines on it might help
[12583.39s -> 12605.66s]  That's right. I'm gonna try scan lines. See hold on. I don't want you to see my I'm not wearing any clothes
[12606.18s -> 12611.17s]  All right, I'm gonna try you tell me which one

[12669.62s -> 12673.13s]  I'm dreaming that I'm playing this
[12674.09s -> 12682.67s]  2006 YouTube I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna go back. I'm going back. Just hold on
[12696.90s -> 12701.76s]  It does look like I'm holding it in front of a TV
[12702.36s -> 12723.32s]  Yeah, it looks like I'm pointing a camera at the TV the brightness down. How's that? I think that looks all right
[12723.32s -> 12768.59s]  That's actually not that bad. Let's go. Whoa. I have a lot of money. Is there like a dash? Whoa
[12769.21s -> 12770.89s]  I can change character
[12770.89s -> 12784.01s]  All right, that's pretty sick. I got another character but bloom on your webcam
[12785.05s -> 12793.60s]  This is a quo. I think it has killed that
[12794.30s -> 12799.86s]  cool
[12799.86s -> 12803.00s]  This game is actually really good
[12803.44s -> 12808.74s]  But bloom on you. I don't think I know I can't I don't know how to do that

[12833.22s -> 12837.74s]  grenades I could see how this would this would be
[12838.42s -> 12840.10s]  absolutely phenomenal
[12840.10s -> 12845.41s]  Like this is a great game
[12847.00s -> 12853.18s]  I have to collect them or something. Are they just worth money?
[12856.41s -> 12862.42s]  Bionicle series literally saved Lego from bankruptcy. It was the Holy Grail for them. It's pretty sick
[12863.04s -> 12874.50s]  You need your green
[12876.48s -> 12880.78s]  Gustability here. Is it Balta? I don't have this ability
[12881.46s -> 12884.40s]  So I do I have to leave
[12896.81s -> 12899.56s]  Bionicles were dope. I
[12899.92s -> 12904.88s]  Bionicle kind of passed by me. They weren't quite my generation. It was just barely
[12905.60s -> 12924.99s]  You're very old. Yeah
[12925.19s -> 12936.63s]  So when I feel that thing up at the top that means I've got maximum amount of money from this level
[12937.35s -> 12956.32s]  Hero mode increases weapon power and allows you to trigger gold
[12957.40s -> 12958.76s]  Constructions

[13287.13s -> 13293.02s]  I had a prompt for something. What was that?
[13293.38s -> 13327.60s]  Yeah, this is bionicle. I had a lot of people with that. That's a lot of money. Give me I like the building stuff
[13327.60s -> 13359.08s]  It's fun about to go hero mode. I need health. This is literally a cooler Lego game. I mean, it's pretty cool

[13509.06s -> 13511.94s]  Can't make it. I don't have the ability. I
[13516.83s -> 13526.36s]  Apparently can't do anything. You wasted the hero mode. No, I got it. Oh, okay

[15571.13s -> 15577.05s]  Take a break go pee come back one more level and then we'll play something else. This is very good though
[15577.61s -> 15580.52s]  I'm very happy with this one
[15580.52s -> 15586.95s]  Only four percent game progress. How long is this game? Wow. All right, I brought back go pee
[15587.51s -> 15829.66s]  Grab a snack or something back in like two minutes. Okay
[15830.30s -> 15856.57s]  These things are so good. I could eat these until I puked. I really could these pretzel rods
[15858.25s -> 15875.75s]  These things I could eat these until I threw up. It's got to be the rods though
[15877.67s -> 15889.21s]  You know what I mean, you need to get a hundred percent progress that's not going to happen tonight honey mustard
[15890.60s -> 15893.85s]  A lot of people are going to think i'm gross for this, but I really do mean this
[15893.85s -> 15909.56s]  I think I've probably talked about this before trust me you dan's game that I didn't even say anything you see ready
[15912.31s -> 15915.96s]  Pretzel rods. I didn't even say you you didn't I didn't even say anything yet
[15920.50s -> 15924.46s]  You make tuna fish, you know, like as if you were going to make a tuna fish sandwich
[15925.43s -> 15931.16s]  Lose the bread bowl of tuna fish, you know with the mayo like as if you're going to put it in a sandwich
[15931.66s -> 15939.61s]  Don't even get the bread out of the out of the container pretzel rods tuna fish dip bite get a good amount
[15939.61s -> 15952.01s]  Good paste of the tuna on there. I just stabbed myself in the fucking lip and i'm pissed at all of you. It's so good
[15956.90s -> 15984.12s]  It is so good. No spices. Just tuna mayo. So don't act like you don't do that when you have a pretzel rod
[15984.44s -> 15990.28s]  You don't like squish it up here and like squish it back here and put it down here and over here
[15990.94s -> 15994.84s]  You
[15998.52s -> 16006.41s]  Tuna is cat food. I burnt my screen in I burnt my screen and I burnt my screen and I burnt my screen and
[16008.10s -> 16010.39s]  I burnt my screen in
[16010.39s -> 16014.39s]  It's my my screen's ruined. I you can't see this. My screen is burnt in
[16016.70s -> 16018.57s]  What?
[16018.57s -> 16024.31s]  No, no, this is really bad. This is really bad. Hold on
[16028.18s -> 16037.18s]  What the fuck?
[16037.18s -> 16041.40s]  Why is my why is it burnt in?
[16041.40s -> 16054.26s]  Hold on. I gotta take a picture of this. You have to see this it's burnt into the capture card. I have no idea
[16060.09s -> 16075.88s]  Yeah, this is not going away. It's okay. I gotta get this into discord. You can make out the letters
[16077.32s -> 16084.87s]  It says like reset start. Oh my god. Let me just see what happens
[16084.87s -> 16095.93s]  Yeah, because when I was paused here, it says yeah resume it's burnt into the capture card. Hold on. This is so stupid
[16096.81s -> 16115.18s]  You can see resume options and quit. Hold on. Let me get this so I can put it on the stream. Well done
[16115.58s -> 16119.19s]  Okay
[16119.19s -> 16136.38s]  Okay, got it. All right. This is what I see right now and I i'm gonna have to probably restart everything
[16152.36s -> 16170.70s]  So let me know when you can see it. You see that this sucks
[16172.06s -> 16175.64s]  I'm gonna I have to restart the capture card probably but that's what I see
[16184.79s -> 16197.40s]  Resume options and quit and then game progress is right there. You're making it worse. Can you guys make it out?
[16199.94s -> 16206.98s]  That says resume. I am i'm
[16207.60s -> 16217.00s]  Flabbergasted right now. I don't know what to do. Uh, what do I what should I do about this? This is unbearable
[16220.55s -> 16224.95s]  It's your screen. Not your card. Hold on
[16226.26s -> 16228.26s]  Fuck my screen
[16228.34s -> 16234.74s]  Hold on a second. I'm gonna laugh my ass off if I switch to my actual monitor and is it still there?
[16236.02s -> 16246.90s]  Thank god. It's not okay. Wait a minute. Is it it actually might still be here? No, it can't no. No, no
[16247.30s -> 16248.98s]  I'm seeing things
[16248.98s -> 16262.30s]  It's burnt into my capture card. Um, why would you not be seeing it though? Hold on. Fuck. It's still there
[16269.94s -> 16274.66s]  Oh, I didn't save the game. I didn't save the game. I didn't save the game. I'm so fucking annoyed right now
[16275.14s -> 16280.36s]  I didn't save the game. Did I it's still there?
[16285.93s -> 16300.36s]  It's on the actual oh no, it's it's over reset your monitor. Hold on. Let me see if it's still here
[16305.83s -> 16307.83s]  Yeah, it's burnt into the fucking capture card
[16313.43s -> 16316.07s]  I have to take another picture. You guys need to see it
[16323.86s -> 16325.86s]  It's so stupid
[16331.26s -> 16337.91s]  What are you our savior? I wonder if I can fix it somehow
[16340.84s -> 16349.69s]  It's 100. No, it's not the screen because I just changed over to my different. Um, I changed over to my other input
[16350.09s -> 16359.48s]  Let me reset the card. It's definitely still there
[16362.81s -> 16373.54s]  God damn it. Give me a second. Show us again. Hold on. I wasn't even gone for that long
[16376.68s -> 16379.88s]  Honestly, I was I was only gone for like five minutes. Not even two minutes
[16384.04s -> 16387.56s]  Here. Look, here's the other one just to prove that it's a different screenshot
[16393.85s -> 16405.14s]  If I could get it on there, that'd be great. Here's the next one
[16408.90s -> 16410.90s]  This one you can see it a lot better
[16411.35s -> 16413.37s]  there
[16413.37s -> 16419.37s]  Reset your monitor. It's image retention interlacing makes that happen. Sometimes our cycle you monitor. It's 100% not burning. Okay
[16420.25s -> 16429.40s]  So you're saying I should not be concerned about like this for instance, right?
[16430.04s -> 16442.14s]  Like I shouldn't be concerned about this
[16454.87s -> 16457.91s]  All right. I'm gonna reset the monitor and see if that fixes it
[16461.34s -> 16472.73s]  okay, resetting it coming back and
[16476.20s -> 16484.33s]  It's still kind of there
[16484.33s -> 16497.16s]  Wait, I think it's better the more you play the quicker it will go away. I feel like it's very faintly there still
[16497.24s -> 16508.76s]  All right. Well good. Let's just go. All right. Well, sorry about that. It was weird time to replace the monitor
[16509.24s -> 16516.52s]  No, i'm good. It would have been funny if your face was burned in
[16524.33s -> 16533.56s]  You have nine more days to play smite and get the 10 year anniversary rewards. I don't I don't what what are you talking about?
[16536.54s -> 16547.98s]  It's still there. I'm just gonna play and see if it fixes itself. I reset the monitor. I'm just gonna play
[16549.82s -> 16569.43s]  That's very very annoying. What's the last place I was here? No, what opened up? Nothing. Oh, okay
[16573.59s -> 16585.64s]  Our cycle not reset. Are you serious? Hold on like unplug it
[16606.89s -> 16622.06s]  Which one of these is the power cable? Oh my god, don't spill. All right. The monitor is unplugged. Oh shit
[16622.06s -> 16630.42s]  What just happened with my stream? All right. I'm good. All right coming back
[16645.51s -> 16650.94s]  I would I would pay extra dude. I would pay extra to be able to have them on the top
[16651.26s -> 16660.15s]  It's still there still there. I just unplugged it and plugged it back in it's there
[16660.23s -> 16675.66s]  I think it might be there forever. This is actually that kind of sucks. I'll just have to deal with it
[16679.59s -> 16681.59s]  Yeah, I can still see resume on my screen
[16689.19s -> 16715.86s]  Well, the pretzel rod is worth it. What's that sound? What's that sound? What's the why do I hear like crushing water?
[16716.34s -> 16758.17s]  You guys don't hear this you don't hold on. Can you hear this? Can you guys hear that?
[16761.86s -> 16764.90s]  It's so loud. Why what's happening to my fucking computer?
[16765.30s -> 16775.53s]  This is a disaster because I got up to piss with my mouse
[16782.52s -> 16789.32s]  My everything is backwards because I unplugged the monitor and it automatically corrected it to put the monitors in the wrong place
[16793.74s -> 16812.25s]  You guys cannot fucking hear this. I don't know how you can't you can you guys hear the rushing water?
[16812.49s -> 16847.51s]  I'm trying to make it so you can hear some cables unplugged or something. I don't know how what is going on right now, huh?
[16847.99s -> 16872.46s]  What's what just happened? Hello. Can everybody hear me? I have no more control over obs
[16876.17s -> 16888.58s]  It am I even on camera? This has been an insane last 15 minutes. Um, I can't even see my other monitor
[16904.68s -> 16906.84s]  Yeah, I all right. Well, let's just let's just go
[16909.67s -> 16912.15s]  I I can't I I don't have another monitor. It's gone
[16913.85s -> 16915.85s]  Burn this one in this one doesn't work
[16943.00s -> 16945.00s]  Yeah, so what why did that happen?
[16945.77s -> 16950.17s]  Why would I have a bad burn in for five? It wasn't even five minutes
[16950.65s -> 16954.89s]  Doesn't it take like hours or days to burn into your fucking screen?
[16955.85s -> 16961.99s]  And then all I heard was like
[16962.15s -> 17012.65s]  Through my headphones. All right, I gotta get in there. This thing does a lot of damage now
[17013.29s -> 17035.02s]  Let's go. What did that do? Oh
[17035.82s -> 17055.62s]  On the ground. He's so into it. I kind of am it's just fun to shoot stuff and collect everything. It's fun
[17057.53s -> 17061.86s]  We'll move on after this level though. There's a bunch more stuff. I want to do tonight
[17062.58s -> 17079.61s]  We're gonna go long
[17079.61s -> 17098.49s]  Probably a 24 hour stream. No, not that long, but we'll go longer than like five for sure
[17121.27s -> 17126.57s]  We're gonna do a new longest stream ever. I doubt I doubt that I would say no
[17138.09s -> 17140.33s]  But I know I could be wrong. I could be wrong

[20338.73s -> 20342.82s]  One, two, three go Travis's race. I promise
[20345.00s -> 20354.70s]  Last one for real scoop on your marks get set go
[20357.16s -> 20359.64s]  Scoop has Travis watch out scoop
[20372.25s -> 20374.25s]  lap two
[20375.14s -> 20377.14s]  Watch out scoop
[20377.38s -> 20391.24s]  lap three

[20491.83s -> 20493.83s]  All right, that's the worst part of the whole run
[20497.83s -> 20502.31s]  That's the shittiest part of the run plumbing puzzle
[20505.86s -> 20518.81s]  Can I move faster here crow is the worst one?
[20519.45s -> 20550.17s]  That was clean clean good timing
[20552.41s -> 20559.69s]  Think is bad bad rng. I think it gets up 12
[20562.74s -> 20578.47s]  Just can't mess up the crow part. It's not there. Don't be fooled
[20579.03s -> 20581.03s]  Lots of other runners get fooled by that
[20581.27s -> 20599.51s]  I don't think I could do this one any better if I wanted to
[20628.84s -> 20635.29s]  god like rng
[20635.29s -> 20640.33s]  Absolutely god like rng great holy shit all done pray for that kind of fucking rng

[20719.48s -> 20720.60s]  Yes
[20720.60s -> 20722.04s]  Good work
[20722.04s -> 20724.04s]  We can build it
[20738.15s -> 20740.15s]  Where can she be
[20741.78s -> 20742.82s]  Good
[20742.82s -> 20752.65s]  I'm definitely gonna get sub 12. No doubt porcupine rest
[20758.90s -> 20764.18s]  This one's really really tricky. If you don't get a good rng, then i'm just gonna stop saying that word because like I don't know
[20764.18s -> 20768.15s]  What the fuck i'm talking about
[20768.15s -> 20770.15s]  That's it loppy
[20770.15s -> 20774.44s]  I couldn't press it. I couldn't press it. It wouldn't let me
[20776.34s -> 20777.86s]  That's it loppy
[20777.86s -> 20792.10s]  That's it loppy. Yes. That's great. The porcupines will be safe now. That wasn't a joke
[20792.74s -> 20807.40s]  Where can she be
[20808.46s -> 20811.34s]  Definitely way better than last time
[20819.91s -> 20821.67s]  Scary easy
[20821.67s -> 20862.63s]  Making sure it's on easy. This one sucks. This is making this is gonna make a break the whole run get out what?
[20879.03s -> 20881.35s]  Get the fuck out of here. All right, that was
[20882.49s -> 20884.09s]  They gotta land
[20884.09s -> 20886.73s]  No, you want them not to land so they eat your crops
[20889.34s -> 20903.80s]  i'm fine
[20903.80s -> 20912.30s]  There's not much left. We have dance party. We have what's left
[20915.29s -> 20927.29s]  Wendy's birthday when his fucking birthday. Just okay. Here we go. Do I need to use all the ingredients?
[20927.61s -> 20931.75s]  Do I have to use all the ingredients finished?
[20932.78s -> 20937.02s]  Wendy i've got a surprise for you. No, I don't. Okay. All right. Good. Good. Good
[20969.43s -> 20978.10s]  This is it. This is it coming up. He's doing the cubrics there. Is it time after this?
[20981.53s -> 20991.48s]  Is that it what about your time time when right?
[20991.48s -> 20993.88s]  Yeah
[20993.88s -> 21008.73s]  Bubble trouble. Oh fuck. Oops. Oh no. Oh no
[21009.21s -> 21020.41s]  Why is wendy's birthday in front of bubble trouble?
[21023.54s -> 21027.54s]  Uh, it was so I was probably gonna be sub 12 probably probably even sub like 11 30
[21034.95s -> 21065.51s]  Well, let's just let's just see what would happen. Let's just see what if I did this so clean last time
[21066.31s -> 21069.00s]  Yeah, so now I uh
[21069.56s -> 21071.56s]  That sucks. It would have been sub 12
[21072.04s -> 21077.22s]  I know it's i'm not it's an illegal run. I'm not saying it's legal. Okay. Can I do this one more time?
[21079.98s -> 21084.70s]  Move the bowl around the screen. A lot of people don't want me to do this, but like can I do it one more time?
[21085.50s -> 21087.34s]  Where can she be?
[21087.34s -> 21090.94s]  Because there's that's a sub 12 run right there. When do I hit the stop?
[21090.94s -> 21104.15s]  When do I write when the cutscene ends, please? No viewers are gonna plug it. It's only 10 minutes
[21104.71s -> 21107.64s]  It's the last input
[21107.64s -> 21122.78s]  It's only 10 minutes dude. My six-year-old has never been more interested in you. Can I have one more attempt?
[21124.22s -> 21125.74s]  I promise I
[21125.74s -> 21132.46s]  This is the last time and no resets either and I promise like my head's not like shaped
[21133.93s -> 21138.86s]  Like I had my head's not made of clay. I promise. I don't know what this I don't know
[21138.86s -> 21143.74s]  What's going on back here, but I promise it's I didn't it's not what it's normal. It's not as abnormal
[21146.34s -> 21151.35s]  Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right, right. You should watch the world record
[21151.43s -> 21153.43s]  No, no, I don't want to I don't want to get anything in my head
[21159.16s -> 21162.41s]  This is it
[21162.41s -> 21165.16s]  Does it matter what I start with?
[21165.80s -> 21167.80s]  Could I start with bubble trouble?
[21175.10s -> 21175.98s]  No
[21175.98s -> 21182.70s]  Why not if you don't get sub-12 you have to drink pilk. Okay
[21190.42s -> 21195.99s]  Okay, if I get if I don't get sub-12 i'll drink a glass of pilk on stream in like 20 minutes
[21197.19s -> 21200.07s]  All right. This is it. This is this is one i'm gonna start with bubble trouble. Is that illegal?
[21200.31s -> 21205.37s]  Can I actually start on this or is that illegal read the mod chat?
[21217.00s -> 21220.60s]  World record video stops the timer when the final loading screen pops up
[21220.84s -> 21225.72s]  The world record starts with the radiators and the crows since they have the most rng
[21231.03s -> 21236.63s]  All right, so we're starting with radiator. No, we're gonna do it my way starting with bubble trouble
[21237.75s -> 21245.40s]  No resets no bullshit. This is it. I'm trying when we sub-12 illegal i'm gonna get a it's gonna be legal
[21247.13s -> 21253.24s]  I'm not gonna pause then unpause and no, this is just really going crows only count if they land first. Okay
[21253.32s -> 21255.88s]  All right. I'm ready. I'm ready to get sub-12
[21255.96s -> 21259.10s]  And i'm gonna do my strap
[21259.98s -> 21263.34s]  All right, i'm gonna start because I want wendy's birthday to be the end of the run
[21266.10s -> 21272.92s]  Bubbled trouble. I did it out of order. It's uh, what can I do it out of order? Is that okay? What the fuck happened back?
[21273.64s -> 21304.25s]  Bubbled trouble not bad not bad
[21319.26s -> 21331.35s]  I almost fucked that up
[21332.31s -> 21335.70s]  No travis's race day

[21386.78s -> 21404.82s]  Don't blow it here
[21405.90s -> 21407.90s]  Why are you doing the cringe face to me? What?
[21407.98s -> 21409.98s]  Why'd you do that scoop is

[24255.82s -> 24257.79s]  That's a lot
[24257.79s -> 24259.79s]  Oh, I have to drink this. Okay. Here we go
[24283.76s -> 24288.28s]  Okay, it tastes like
[24288.28s -> 24289.88s]  you know when you have a
[24289.88s -> 24292.04s]  Float like a root beer float or a coke float
[24292.84s -> 24296.60s]  And you get to the very very bottom but there's nothing left in the glass
[24297.24s -> 24301.48s]  But there's a little bit of this weird foam fluid down there
[24303.36s -> 24310.72s]  That's what this tastes like
[24310.80s -> 24312.80s]  I mean, it's not that good
[24313.72s -> 24315.72s]  But I wouldn't consider this to be bad
[24318.35s -> 24321.21s]  I wouldn't say this is bad
[24321.21s -> 24323.21s]  This does not this does not taste bad
[24328.89s -> 24333.37s]  You guys are gonna get me so fucked up now i'm gonna just wait i'm gonna drink this like tomorrow and the next day
[24333.37s -> 24335.37s]  And the next day i'll be like, yeah, i'm just doing it ironically
[24335.93s -> 24337.53s]  Same shit's gonna happen to me
[24337.53s -> 24339.52s]  But like takis
[24339.52s -> 24344.88s]  I bought takis. I tried them. I told you guys they were the world most disgusting vile snack i've ever eaten
[24345.92s -> 24347.92s]  And now I can't stop eating them
[24352.09s -> 24354.25s]  I seriously thought takis were a zero
[24356.01s -> 24358.78s]  zero
[24358.78s -> 24359.90s]  and
[24359.90s -> 24364.54s]  I just was like, oh, haha. I think me and holly were literally at the grocery store. It's like oh
[24365.18s -> 24367.18s]  Let's get those. Isn't that funny?
[24367.18s -> 24370.22s]  Yeah, they're gross. They suck. I haven't had them in a while. You wanna try one?
[24371.10s -> 24373.10s]  and then we both go like
[24375.82s -> 24377.82s]  That lime's kind of good though
[24378.38s -> 24381.50s]  Gross I hate you hate them too. I hate them too
[24382.80s -> 24385.24s]  and then
[24385.24s -> 24387.24s]  Ever since I bought them every time
[24388.12s -> 24392.28s]  I've ever gone to the grocery store since it's not an ironic funny joke anymore
[24393.48s -> 24395.48s]  Just doing it and I just enjoy it and I like it
[24396.20s -> 24409.29s]  What's wrong with me?
[24409.29s -> 24411.45s]  It's not good. Like I just it's not good
[24412.09s -> 24416.75s]  But it's definitely not the reaction. I think a lot of people thought was gonna happen where i'm like
[24417.55s -> 24419.55s]  Like spitting it. No, it's like fine
[24420.20s -> 24422.20s]  It tastes like fizzy milk
[24423.18s -> 24425.18s]  It tastes like carbonated milk
[24425.58s -> 24427.02s]  But sweet
[24427.02s -> 24431.66s]  It's like the bottom of a root beer float. It's just like whatever you have serious problems
[24436.41s -> 24440.06s]  You're gaslighting yourself
[24440.06s -> 24442.78s]  Yeah, it's the bottom of a root beer float. You if you know if you know, you know
[24443.42s -> 24447.50s]  I would not recommend drinking this for any reason unless it's like somebody bet you and they're like, oh dude drink
[24447.58s -> 24452.59s]  It'll be funny. This shit is fucking cold though
[24453.23s -> 24456.91s]  This shit is gold
[24456.91s -> 24459.15s]  This is the good shit. I'm telling you. This is the good shit
[24460.76s -> 24464.44s]  You want you want do you want to drink gold milk? Get it telling you this is the good shit
[24466.30s -> 24469.34s]  This that this is a it's a delicacy in this household
[24470.06s -> 24475.66s]  All right. Let me let me bring this back. I don't want to put it in the fridge
[24551.12s -> 24553.12s]  Let's see what we do gonna get burnt into this

[24563.16s -> 24566.36s]  What is going on on screen to have to have a vibrate the controller that hard?
[24568.78s -> 24572.94s]  God, I need a break
[24572.94s -> 24574.94s]  That's a good break
[24575.74s -> 24585.02s]  It's scooby scratching
[24585.02s -> 24594.36s]  All right. So what can I do with the double jump?
[24601.60s -> 24607.53s]  Sue's drunk on pill
[24607.53s -> 24609.53s]  Jump off the boat with a double jump
[24620.94s -> 24626.27s]  Thank you for playing these even if you had to skip vampire countdown. I mean
[24627.53s -> 24630.73s]  I like just kind of jumping on random shit for like an hour or so
[24633.29s -> 24635.93s]  These these place these old kind of grab bag
[24637.45s -> 24642.67s]  You never know what you're gonna get if you be anything we could get absolute dog shit or we get a fucking legendary
[24642.73s -> 24644.73s]  Bionicle game, you know what I mean?
[24645.23s -> 24653.80s]  Can I not go this way?

[24719.88s -> 24722.68s]  Is it scooby snacks? I feel like that's so I feel like that's easy though
[24723.40s -> 24725.80s]  Oh, it's like a crunchy like dog treat
[24727.56s -> 24729.56s]  It's not like a lasagna

[24898.72s -> 24903.13s]  Do you think they would win here food doesn't grow on trees
[24904.35s -> 24906.35s]  Do you think that they would actually win?
[24906.35s -> 24910.25s]  What if they had like good policy?
[24910.25s -> 24912.81s]  I feel like it'd be kind of funny

[26274.44s -> 26276.44s]  Called largo winch
[26279.52s -> 26281.60s]  I've never heard of this before until literally

[26324.96s -> 26327.16s]  This is tv show
[26327.16s -> 26334.62s]  Okay
[26334.62s -> 26335.74s]  All right
[26335.74s -> 26336.94s]  Let's go
[26336.94s -> 26356.96s]  I'm getting out of play. Hmm
[26364.92s -> 26370.92s]  Welcome to the construction site largo when you're ready come and join me inside use the directional button on the left analog to walk
[26371.56s -> 26380.14s]  This game's very crunchy
[26381.69s -> 26385.05s]  We're a little late. So let's race to the port of the cabin
[26386.03s -> 26387.23s]  You're on
[26387.23s -> 26389.23s]  Hold on r2 to run
[26395.45s -> 26397.53s]  I can hear this game in my teeth
[26399.45s -> 26401.45s]  Well, that got my circulation going
[26404.86s -> 26408.22s]  Let me show you how to use objects walk up to the button and press x
[26409.02s -> 26420.91s]  That was I just punched
[26443.20s -> 26448.78s]  I don't know. I don't know how to do it press the button
[26453.90s -> 26455.50s]  No
[26455.50s -> 26458.30s]  Good. Remember to use any object press x button
[26459.16s -> 26461.16s]  Unfortunately, this button seems to be broken
[26461.40s -> 26464.12s]  We don't have the time to wait to get it fixed so you'll have to do it yourself
[26465.24s -> 26466.28s]  what
[26466.28s -> 26471.06s]  Try this toolkit pick it up. Just walk over it and then try pressing x button on the switch again
[26474.31s -> 26477.11s]  Why do I walk a waddle around like I made it a fucking clay?
[26478.15s -> 26483.83s]  Okay, I got a toolkit
[26483.83s -> 26490.74s]  Pick up the toolkit by walk. I just did it
[26491.06s -> 26493.62s]  Did you not just watch me do that?
[26494.58s -> 26498.10s]  Very good. You're learning fast to see what objects you have in your possession press select
[26498.74s -> 26500.90s]  Okay
[26500.90s -> 26502.66s]  Cool bare hands
[26510.58s -> 26514.42s]  Sometimes you'll have to search other objects to get them this door needs a security car to open it
[26514.42s -> 26536.47s]  There's one in that desk. Did you just cut me off when I was in the middle of doing it?
[26538.54s -> 26549.35s]  I was doing it
[26550.62s -> 26553.08s]  What
[26553.08s -> 26564.34s]  Fuck out of here
[26564.34s -> 26568.15s]  I'm just kidding with you. I'm just messing around
[26577.85s -> 26579.98s]  Hey, you locked me out
[26579.98s -> 26581.98s]  Make your way around the side. I'll see you later
[26588.31s -> 26590.31s]  Don't get stuck in this game
[26591.35s -> 26597.37s]  Climb over any obstacle
[26597.37s -> 26599.96s]  Good to know I would have I never would have figured that out
[26604.18s -> 26606.18s]  You want to watch out for the
[26606.24s -> 26611.94s]  Excavation run up to it and then jump over it using triangle. Don't miss though. It's a long way down
[26619.98s -> 26624.50s]  oops
[26624.58s -> 26632.10s]  Mid-jump you gotta I think I can fucking make it

[26639.91s -> 26643.99s]  I've got a prediction. I think this might be the gem of the night. I'm just saying
[26645.64s -> 26648.04s]  I'm just saying I think this has got
[26649.14s -> 26651.88s]  Unbelievable potential and I mean unbelievable potential
[26657.54s -> 26671.32s]  The versus has a nine on their back. What is that?
[26672.12s -> 26676.98s]  Practice punching and kicking. There's a kick
[26677.62s -> 26683.80s]  Oh, that is not a kick that it that is a like
[26684.44s -> 26686.44s]  a post-op
[26686.44s -> 26696.74s]  Oh, I can't wait to play this
[26696.82s -> 26700.34s]  Okay, you will find blocking to be very useful in any fights you get into
[26702.90s -> 26704.90s]  I think I okay block
[26705.46s -> 26721.62s]  Will you do something?
[26721.62s -> 26723.30s]  He's not fighting
[26723.30s -> 26724.66s]  He's not
[26724.66s -> 26736.60s]  Kick his ass. I'm supposed to be blocking a punch. He just won't punch punch me, please
[26742.84s -> 26743.96s]  What
[26743.96s -> 26750.55s]  How do I stop looking at this guy?
[26760.42s -> 26770.10s]  Wait, I go the wrong way
[26770.10s -> 26771.22s]  Where

[26773.62s -> 26776.26s]  Where are we? This is a strange what?
[26776.98s -> 26779.54s]  It's like dirt wood concrete
[26783.02s -> 26784.38s]  What is going on?
[26784.38s -> 26786.87s]  It's a construction site
[26788.41s -> 26791.13s]  This looks just weird. It's just a weird place
[26791.77s -> 26799.85s]  How do I get the hell out of here? He said follow me follow you to follow you where?
[26807.48s -> 26809.32s]  Can you open this open the door?

[26819.06s -> 26825.18s]  Down the ramp
[26825.18s -> 26829.98s]  I physically could not walk down there a minute ago. I was running into invisible wall
[26835.38s -> 26836.58s]  combos
[26836.58s -> 26840.66s]  With his back to you as joe teach you how to knock guards unconscious
[26841.22s -> 26844.50s]  Further away is Morgan with whom you can try out everything you've learned
[26851.48s -> 26853.48s]  You won't kill a guard with this move
[26854.22s -> 26856.22s]  Good. That's not my style. Anyway
[26856.71s -> 26858.87s]  I know however, he'll be out cold for a while
[26859.83s -> 26862.23s]  So I don't need to worry about him waking up while i'm still around
[26863.11s -> 26867.83s]  Correct one more thing if you're going to pull this move off the guard has to be totally unaware of your presence
[26868.55s -> 26876.74s]  Okay
[26876.74s -> 26880.15s]  combo

[26940.17s -> 26991.50s]  All right, fuck off. Is there a heel? Okay. Hold down r1 to sneak use the brain wave monitor
[26991.82s -> 27020.39s]  This guard isn't looking in your directions. He's sneakers
[27027.26s -> 27035.34s]  Okay
[27035.34s -> 27037.98s]  You can peer around corners by holding l2
[27038.62s -> 27040.62s]  And use the controls, okay
[27040.70s -> 27086.09s]  Okay, so what's okay crouches r1?
[27101.14s -> 27126.15s]  Is he looking over here? Where can I leave?

[27148.87s -> 27150.87s]  Oh my god. All right. All right. All right
[27151.03s -> 27158.87s]  This might be causing the crackling the disk speed thing. Oh, is it spinning too fast?
[27175.05s -> 27201.54s]  Here's this guy
[27201.62s -> 27203.06s]  Whoa, okay

[27236.74s -> 27244.31s]  Because to on to me he's looking in the same direction. Oh my god. He's looking at me. Oh my god
[27258.34s -> 27261.77s]  Is this a sex game fan that person for like 10 minutes?

[27529.67s -> 27535.43s]  The south american redemption have taken over the building but insists their intentions are peaceful

[27545.13s -> 27548.09s]  Who was sent to interview lago winch earlier today?
[27548.57s -> 27555.53s]  This is an important development if they release the head of the w corporation it shows they definitely are peaceful
[27556.73s -> 27558.49s]  So what do I have to do?
[27558.49s -> 27562.65s]  This is an ai voice
