[1.72s -> 20.14s]  Yes, yes, I know that you were expecting Christmas dinner tonight, and instead you walked in the door, hung your coat up, you looked around the room, looked around the kitchen, and there was nothing in the oven.
[20.14s -> 39.65s]  There was no trays out with foil on them. There was no atmosphere that there was any food, and you were told now when you came in, yes, we're going to be having microwaved pizzas tonight.
[44.38s -> 63.23s]  Hello! Hi, how are you? Welcome. Welcome to the stream. Some of you may be confused by the title and the game that's on that title.
[63.23s -> 72.90s]  And a lot of you might be wondering, man, what does that microphone sure does sound better, doesn't it? That sounds a lot different. That sounds much cleaner, doesn't it?
[72.90s -> 80.57s]  I'd like to see ones in chat if you can tell me if it sounds very clean and very new and refreshing to you.
[80.57s -> 103.56s]  Alright, so let me tell you what I did. Finally, finally, finally, I know, I know, finally, I didn't do anything. I lied. You see what I'm saying? Do you understand now? I didn't do anything.
[103.56s -> 114.62s]  It's the exact same mic, the exact same setup, nothing fucking changed. Not one thing changed. It's the exact same microphone.
[114.62s -> 128.29s]  You know, like, 2020 hindsight, but here's the thing. I need to, I might just do it and I don't even care, like just the few thousand of you that are here right now, just don't, just quiet about it.
[128.29s -> 145.65s]  If I had like an audio tech guy come on stream and do a bunch of shit, and he'll put up a bunch of shit on the stream, I'll capture it on OBS, moving knobs left and right, having a big pair of headphones on, raising the, you know, on the equalizer.
[145.65s -> 157.30s]  Yep, that's better. Keep talking. Keep talking. And I don't change fucking any settings. Like the next day, people are just going to think that it's better when he didn't do anything. It was an actor.
[157.30s -> 175.87s]  I should have just done that. But yes, no, we have a lot to talk about. Oh boy, do we have a lot to talk about. Okay, so here, let's start, let's start with the bad news.
[175.87s -> 187.42s]  The bad news is today was going to be Green Screen Movie Night Part 2, but it's not. There's nothing wrong with the playlist. Everything's done. It's ready to go.
[187.42s -> 201.28s]  It's been ready for the last few days, from my understanding. The problem was I got up today and a problem I've been having recently, you guys know that the last week or two has been kind of a pain in the ass.
[201.28s -> 209.43s]  COVID kind of came through the house and I didn't get it, but maybe I did. I don't know.
[209.43s -> 218.84s]  And ever since, I've been getting these digestive problems and these fucking headaches. And I woke up today and I had one of these annoying headaches.
[218.84s -> 230.67s]  And if I were to laugh really, really hard like we did last week or whatever week before, I would have to turn the stream off in like 40 minutes.
[230.67s -> 239.66s]  So I've got kind of an issue in my brain today and I knew for a fact that it would be a bad idea.
[239.66s -> 252.29s]  So if I were to watch two or three of those videos and they were really funny, I might have to just leave and turn it off.
[252.29s -> 257.96s]  But here's the good news. It's not like, oh, it's over. You're never going to see it.
[257.96s -> 262.96s]  No, it's just whenever in the next probably few days or in the next, maybe next weekend or something.
[262.96s -> 274.06s]  Because let me tell you something. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. We have this stream every single day next week, pretty much.
[274.06s -> 279.53s]  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So it's a packed week.
[279.53s -> 285.83s]  And the reason why I'm doing that is not just because there's a lot of fun stuff to do with, you know, friends and streamers and stuff.
[285.83s -> 294.07s]  It's the baseball show is the 19th of this month. So I want to get a lot of streams.
[294.07s -> 301.98s]  So because I'm obviously not you're not going to see me for a little while after after next weekend.
[301.98s -> 314.93s]  You are going to not see me till baseball. You don't want to laugh, but you're going to play this sim casino game.
[314.93s -> 317.36s]  Well, here's the difference, right?
[317.36s -> 324.43s]  There's there's there's laughing at like somebody, you know, puking on the floor in the casino game, whatever.
[324.43s -> 334.49s]  And then there is I don't I can't stop laughing or I can't stop having a major reaction to like three to five straight minutes of video.
[334.49s -> 339.50s]  And I like I do remember last time I was dying last time.
[339.50s -> 349.10s]  So I think it's going to be a little different. It killed me, too. Yeah.
[349.10s -> 356.88s]  And I'll be honest, too. I'd rather be in a better state on like an important special fun night like that.
[356.88s -> 361.18s]  I don't want to just be kind of like, oh, yeah, I feel like shit.
[361.18s -> 365.18s]  Let's do that thing that, you know, I've been looking forward to for, you know, months.
[365.18s -> 368.36s]  No, no, fuck that. You know what I mean?
[368.36s -> 372.56s]  And I know I know it's disappointing. I think it'd be more fun that way.
[372.56s -> 374.56s]  I don't want to just I'd rather be able to enjoy it. Right.
[374.56s -> 383.47s]  But so we're going to his his plan. We're going to do this today. We play sim casino.
[383.47s -> 386.84s]  I'm not going to laugh, but I probably am.
[386.84s -> 389.21s]  I will explain the tweet, by the way.
[389.21s -> 393.21s]  A lot of people are confused by my last tweet, you know, one one tweet a year.
[393.21s -> 397.96s]  Andy, I will explain that because there's a lot of people saying, what are you even talking about?
[397.96s -> 399.96s]  Who's he even talking to? Why is he saying this?
[399.96s -> 403.42s]  OK, let's explain that real quick.
[403.42s -> 409.34s]  If you have an iPhone and you open up an app called Pages, you can do it right now literally while you're sitting and listening to this.
[409.34s -> 416.46s]  Open up Pages and go to, you know, new like I'm going to make a new document.
[416.46s -> 422.65s]  Click on templates, choose template and then new note.
[422.65s -> 427.27s]  And it's just a fucking spell. It's like it's just Latin.
[427.27s -> 431.41s]  So what I had to have done is I have a ton of notes.
[431.41s -> 436.71s]  Right. Because anytime I think of like a stream idea or something, I need to write down some I want to remember talking about.
[436.71s -> 439.71s]  I open up like notes and let's go. All right.
[439.71s -> 443.71s]  It's going to be a stream where I sit on my head and drink a glass of milk. Right.
[443.71s -> 445.95s]  Whatever. That's not you know what I mean.
[445.95s -> 454.94s]  So I must have opened it and didn't do anything and then just went, oh, I'll get to this later.
[454.94s -> 462.38s]  And then a year plus later, I'm cleaning out these and I didn't remember that's what that did.
[462.38s -> 465.64s]  I had no idea that's what that did.
[465.64s -> 471.26s]  You know, like I didn't remember that it fills in placeholder Latin.
[471.26s -> 476.95s]  So I'm sitting there freaking out thinking, why did why is this here?
[476.95s -> 479.19s]  Why is this here?
[479.19s -> 487.08s]  Just think about that. If you have if you don't remember that, if you have no idea why that's there, that somebody wrote Latin in your phone.
[487.08s -> 489.58s]  Who? I didn't fucking do it.
[489.58s -> 494.46s]  You think I don't know Latin? I was going line by line and I was translating it.
[494.46s -> 496.46s]  And it was just gibberish.
[496.46s -> 500.78s]  I was like, what what was I trying to even tell myself?
[500.78s -> 503.78s]  Like, what am I doing? Did I do this like as a joke?
[503.78s -> 507.78s]  Like I was showing somebody like, hey, look, look at my notes for a stream I'm thinking of.
[507.78s -> 512.38s]  It's in Latin. But no.
[512.38s -> 522.31s]  Yeah, it was Lorem Ipsum and it's just the default placeholder for a note take and you just delete it and do your own.
[522.31s -> 527.31s]  But it was scary. I was actually kind of scared for at least 15 to 20 minutes.
[527.31s -> 531.98s]  Yeah, it's just placeholder. I know.
[531.98s -> 538.48s]  But I was putting it into a Latin to English translator and I was getting English words.
[538.48s -> 541.55s]  I was getting English sentences.
[541.55s -> 544.55s]  One of them was like, oh, removal of the makeup or something.
[544.55s -> 548.75s]  And I'm like, removal of the makeup because this is what does that mean?
[548.75s -> 550.75s]  What am I? What do you mean removal of makeup?
[550.75s -> 557.98s]  What does that mean?
[560.35s -> 562.35s]  And I had to forget about it. I had to.
[562.35s -> 566.26s]  When are you going to do the welding stream?
[566.26s -> 567.26s]  Never. What are you talking about?
[567.26s -> 578.70s]  All right. You guys ready? You guys good to go?
[578.70s -> 581.51s]  Latin stream incoming.
[581.51s -> 583.51s]  And there's something about Latin, right?
[583.51s -> 585.51s]  That's all I'm thinking of this. Hold on.
[585.51s -> 592.50s]  All I'm thinking of is every movie I've ever seen where, you know, the priest is sitting there like,
[592.50s -> 597.50s]  And I'm just like, oh, my God, I don't know why.
[597.50s -> 602.74s]  Latin is a scary like demon language in all these fucking movies.
[602.74s -> 604.74s]  So I'm sitting there going like, what is this?
[604.74s -> 616.53s]  The only time they use Latin ever in the last like 20 to 30 to 50 plus years is to make it a scary moment in a horror movie.
[616.53s -> 622.22s]  It's nowhere else. Oh, he's speaking Latin.
[622.22s -> 626.22s]  Oh, shit. The movie just got way scarier, right?
[626.22s -> 628.40s]  So I'm sitting there thinking like, what the hell?
[628.40s -> 637.04s]  Why is this on here?
[637.04s -> 639.66s]  You might be the Antichrist.
[639.66s -> 644.46s]  No, I don't think so.
[644.46s -> 649.73s]  I think I think I would have figured that out a long time ago.
[649.73s -> 656.73s]  I don't think Satan makes the Antichrist baby and then waits till he's 37 to like, oh, OK, time to go.
[656.73s -> 659.03s]  It's the Antichrist. There he is.
[659.03s -> 663.46s]  37 year old fucking comedy dork streamer, German 985.
[663.46s -> 671.03s]  You guys are fucking nuts if you think that. I'm just going to be honest with you. You're crazy.
[671.03s -> 680.76s]  I don't believe that's accurate. All right. Let's go.
[680.76s -> 688.70s]  What do you say? Sim Casino. This has got music, too.
[688.70s -> 692.34s]  All right. What do you say? I mean, I don't really feel that great.
[692.34s -> 697.38s]  Maybe no face game for a little while, but I do need to like learn to play.
[697.38s -> 701.06s]  Now, this is Sim because this is not Casino Inc.
[701.06s -> 703.56s]  This is Sim Casino. It's a different game.
[703.56s -> 708.70s]  What I have confirmed and I know people saying, oh, my God, remember Casino Inc.
[708.70s -> 712.70s]  Where you could like there was like a bunch of crazy shit in that game.
[712.70s -> 716.70s]  I can confirm that I think that people do beat each other up in this game.
[716.70s -> 719.70s]  That's all. I didn't look too much into it, but I know that that's a possibility.
[719.70s -> 722.70s]  So, OK, everybody calm down.
[722.70s -> 726.92s]  But I kind of want to like make a hotel.
[726.92s -> 732.30s]  This game is fairly new as well.
[732.30s -> 737.26s]  This was I think it was an early access or something.
[737.26s -> 745.20s]  It's got a saxophone. All right. Let me learn to play face cam.
[745.20s -> 755.89s]  I'll turn the face cam on in just a minute. Wow.
[755.89s -> 760.58s]  Damn, that that you can always tell when the person that's playing the saxophone
[760.58s -> 762.58s]  knows what they're doing when they do one of those.
[762.58s -> 767.76s]  They do one of those. It's like that.
[767.76s -> 769.76s]  You know what I'm talking about?
[769.76s -> 780.58s]  Did I break it? Sixty. I think I broke that break it.
[780.58s -> 789.50s]  I think I broke it. It doesn't seem like it's functioning.
[789.50s -> 802.45s]  I give it five more seconds.
[803.45s -> 810.27s]  It's crazy because when I do that sound, it sucks and everybody hates it.
[810.27s -> 817.58s]  But when the saxophone does that sound, everybody loves it, right?
[817.58s -> 819.58s]  If I do that sound, everyone's going to leave.
[819.58s -> 821.58s]  All right. I got to reload the game, I think.
[821.58s -> 827.15s]  I want to make a casino.
[827.15s -> 832.64s]  Game is like it's messed up.
[832.64s -> 834.64s]  I messed it up somehow.
[834.64s -> 840.70s]  Try again.
[846.13s -> 848.13s]  Dude, quit. Stop being the Antichrist.
[848.13s -> 850.50s]  Would that be like public knowledge?
[850.50s -> 854.78s]  Could I could I could I even still stream?
[854.78s -> 855.78s]  Would it be you know what I mean?
[855.78s -> 858.78s]  Like, dude, like, of course, like Antichrist Andy like fucked up the game again.
[858.78s -> 860.78s]  Would that would that be like public knowledge?
[860.78s -> 871.60s]  Andy Christ, please.
[871.60s -> 875.59s]  OK, can I maybe tutorials?
[875.59s -> 879.50s]  Maybe because I tried to continue the tutorial.
[879.50s -> 880.50s]  It screwed up. Oh, OK.
[880.50s -> 882.50s]  Here we go. No, what?
[882.50s -> 884.86s]  Oh, no. OK, here we go. All right, let's go.
[884.86s -> 887.04s]  This is a sim casino.
[887.04s -> 892.40s]  All right. Welcome to sim casino.
[892.40s -> 893.40s]  Selected tutorial. All right.
[893.40s -> 894.40s]  How to control the camera.
[894.40s -> 899.25s]  This music.
[901.25s -> 906.82s]  OK, let's see.
[906.82s -> 908.82s]  They just take bags of money outside.
[908.82s -> 911.63s]  OK, let's get a good view of the casino.
[911.63s -> 913.63s]  Remember that you can change the keyboard shortcuts in the settings screen.
[913.63s -> 916.63s]  Hover over an objective or additional info.
[916.63s -> 921.19s]  OK, yeah, that's move, tilt, zoom.
[921.19s -> 924.07s]  Yeah, easy, easy.
[924.07s -> 925.07s]  Continue.
[925.07s -> 927.76s]  All right. Zoom the camera.
[927.76s -> 929.76s]  Move the camera up and down a level.
[929.76s -> 943.38s]  OK, right bracket, page up, left bracket, page down, left bracket, page up, left bracket, page down, left bracket, page up, left bracket, page down, left bracket, page up, left bracket.
[943.38s -> 946.38s]  I just got fucking flashbacks to being invent.
[946.38s -> 949.39s]  You motherfuckers that used to do that.
[949.39s -> 953.23s]  OK, move the camera up and down.
[953.23s -> 960.27s]  Right bracket, page up, page up.
[960.27s -> 961.83s]  Page up.
[961.83s -> 964.33s]  Right bracket.
[964.33s -> 966.50s]  I can't take it.
[966.50s -> 968.00s]  Oh, all right.
[968.00s -> 969.00s]  That's easy.
[969.00s -> 970.00s]  So this is how you go up and down.
[970.00s -> 971.50s]  Is that the only way to do it?
[971.50s -> 972.86s]  Cool.
[972.86s -> 977.43s]  All right.
[977.43s -> 979.43s]  Or click on the arrows on the far left of the screen.
[979.43s -> 981.43s]  Oh, actually, I think I like that better.
[981.43s -> 986.70s]  All right.
[986.70s -> 989.20s]  Tutorial seems like it's pretty quick.
[989.20s -> 993.20s]  We should expand our structure's foundations, which creates a base for us to build in.
[993.20s -> 995.20s]  Hover over the objective for additional help.
[995.20s -> 996.20s]  It's like the wall tool.
[996.20s -> 1000.64s]  OK, look at the left toolbar.
[1000.64s -> 1001.64s]  Hover over the buttons.
[1001.64s -> 1005.64s]  Find it in the build menu at the bottom of the screen.
[1005.64s -> 1006.64s]  All right.
[1006.64s -> 1007.64s]  So we need to make a wall tool.
[1007.64s -> 1010.03s]  Oh, yeah.
[1010.03s -> 1011.03s]  There go walls.
[1011.03s -> 1012.59s]  OK.
[1012.59s -> 1016.59s]  Add at least 100 10 by 10 new ground floor cells.
[1016.59s -> 1017.59s]  All right.
[1017.59s -> 1019.66s]  Doesn't matter where.
[1019.66s -> 1023.46s]  Right there.
[1023.46s -> 1039.85s]  It looks kind of awful.
[1039.85s -> 1044.37s]  What did I do wrong?
[1044.37s -> 1049.69s]  My mic just cut it off.
[1049.69s -> 1051.99s]  Like, stop cutting it off.
[1051.99s -> 1052.99s]  I'm trying to do it.
[1056.28s -> 1060.06s]  Drag to make rooms.
[1060.06s -> 1063.06s]  Oh, I'm doing it like the Sims.
[1063.06s -> 1064.68s]  OK, that's fine.
[1064.68s -> 1066.30s]  OK, cool.
[1066.30s -> 1070.02s]  So you can make rooms like this.
[1070.02s -> 1071.02s]  OK, pretty sweet.
[1071.02s -> 1076.18s]  There are two ways to ensure each area is accessible.
[1076.18s -> 1080.18s]  Removing an interior wall or adding a door, staff door or private door.
[1080.18s -> 1084.18s]  Staff doors are used to secure areas away from the guests, while private doors are used
[1084.18s -> 1088.18s]  for dressing rooms and hotel rooms to separate from the other guests.
[1088.18s -> 1091.35s]  Make sure all ground level areas are accessible.
[1091.35s -> 1092.78s]  OK, so we can just.
[1092.78s -> 1093.78s]  How do we remove?
[1093.78s -> 1098.29s]  Google bar or building?
[1098.29s -> 1100.29s]  Oh, we can go like this.
[1100.29s -> 1103.68s]  Uh, like this.
[1103.68s -> 1115.42s]  Control Z.
[1115.42s -> 1119.42s]  Yeah, this is like a terrible hallway.
[1119.42s -> 1120.42s]  Well, I didn't know that was.
[1120.42s -> 1122.42s]  How do I delete this?
[1122.42s -> 1140.49s]  Cigarette Andy.
[1140.49s -> 1141.49s]  Stop calling me that.
[1141.49s -> 1146.38s]  Oh, fuck.
[1146.38s -> 1147.38s]  This is a tutorial.
[1147.38s -> 1148.38s]  Who cares?
[1148.38s -> 1150.38s]  OK, so how do I make a door?
[1150.38s -> 1151.81s]  Fence.
[1151.81s -> 1154.11s]  The zone.
[1154.11s -> 1155.11s]  Dismantle walls and fences.
[1155.11s -> 1156.11s]  Here we go.
[1156.11s -> 1157.11s]  OK.
[1157.11s -> 1158.11s]  Push tab.
[1158.11s -> 1173.13s]  Remove an interior wall, toolbar or building.
[1173.13s -> 1176.13s]  Drag a line across the area to remove it, but it must be all indoors.
[1176.13s -> 1180.06s]  Oh, this.
[1180.06s -> 1187.38s]  What the fuck?
[1187.38s -> 1195.21s]  Didn't say I can just remove a wall here.
[1195.21s -> 1196.21s]  Stop.
[1196.21s -> 1198.09s]  Cigarette Andy.
[1198.09s -> 1203.76s]  I'll just add a door, I guess, then.
[1203.76s -> 1204.76s]  Dismantle wall.
[1204.76s -> 1205.76s]  D zone.
[1205.76s -> 1206.76s]  Fence.
[1206.76s -> 1208.64s]  Wall tool.
[1208.64s -> 1210.33s]  Operations.
[1210.33s -> 1211.33s]  I don't understand.
[1211.33s -> 1215.49s]  Should I build a fucking fence?
[1215.49s -> 1219.54s]  I'm not crazy, right?
[1219.54s -> 1220.54s]  This is really confusing.
[1220.54s -> 1222.54s]  I don't get it.
[1222.54s -> 1226.41s]  Build menu.
[1226.41s -> 1233.49s]  Where's the build menu?
[1233.49s -> 1235.49s]  This is the build menu here, right?
[1235.49s -> 1243.58s]  He's too high for this.
[1243.58s -> 1247.35s]  Once I figure this out, we're golden.
[1247.35s -> 1248.35s]  But what the?
[1248.35s -> 1249.35s]  B?
[1249.35s -> 1250.35s]  Well, I didn't say B.
[1250.35s -> 1252.35s]  How am I supposed to know it's B?
[1252.35s -> 1256.38s]  How am I supposed to know it's B?
[1256.38s -> 1265.75s]  OK.
[1265.75s -> 1266.75s]  Indoor only.
[1266.75s -> 1271.82s]  My god.
[1271.82s -> 1274.82s]  If I wasn't just a fucking idiot and didn't build these in the middle of nowhere.
[1274.82s -> 1279.45s]  Indoor only?
[1279.45s -> 1289.30s]  OK, we're just going to delete this because, honestly, god.
[1289.30s -> 1293.10s]  What's the delete tool?
[1293.10s -> 1294.10s]  Demolish structures.
[1294.10s -> 1295.10s]  Just get rid of this.
[1295.10s -> 1299.61s]  This needs to be connected to here.
[1299.61s -> 1304.79s]  It can't be a door leading outside.
[1304.79s -> 1305.79s]  I have to make a hallway.
[1305.79s -> 1308.50s]  OK, so let's make a wall.
[1308.50s -> 1312.43s]  Does that work?
[1312.43s -> 1316.53s]  This cannot be reached from the bus stop.
[1316.53s -> 1317.53s]  What do I care?
[1317.53s -> 1320.24s]  There we go.
[1320.24s -> 1323.72s]  Does this count as a room?
[1323.72s -> 1325.72s]  Is this mad that this is not accessible?
[1325.72s -> 1336.37s]  So what's wrong now?
[1336.37s -> 1352.75s]  I wouldn't want it needs to be a door.
[1352.75s -> 1354.75s]  It's mad that it's not a door.
[1354.75s -> 1365.78s]  What do you want from me?
[1365.78s -> 1379.35s]  Why does this count as a room?
[1379.35s -> 1380.35s]  All right.
[1380.35s -> 1386.26s]  I get it.
[1386.26s -> 1391.41s]  This shouldn't even count as a room.
[1391.41s -> 1392.41s]  All right.
[1392.41s -> 1395.78s]  So what's going on here is the same company got hired.
[1395.78s -> 1396.78s]  No, no, no.
[1396.78s -> 1401.90s]  Two different companies got hired to do the same job and we didn't cancel on one of them
[1401.90s -> 1409.42s]  and they just malicious compliance came and just installed their doors and we didn't stop
[1409.42s -> 1411.11s]  them.
[1411.11s -> 1412.11s]  OK, cool.
[1412.11s -> 1414.11s]  Zones create rooms with specialized functionality.
[1414.11s -> 1418.61s]  They can be any shape as long as they meet the minimum requirements.
[1418.61s -> 1421.91s]  They look like bright striped cells with text.
[1421.91s -> 1424.91s]  Go to the game settings to adjust the transparency and press Z to toggle them off and on.
[1424.91s -> 1429.84s]  OK, so this is the garbage zone.
[1429.84s -> 1432.62s]  Oh, OK.
[1432.62s -> 1439.62s]  So this is deliverables, deliveries, garbage, storage, cash vault.
[1439.62s -> 1440.62s]  Oh, we got a cash.
[1440.62s -> 1442.62s]  Why would the cash vault be right here?
[1442.62s -> 1444.62s]  It's just going to be underground, man.
[1444.62s -> 1445.62s]  This is going to be underground.
[1445.62s -> 1448.58s]  OK, that's cool.
[1448.58s -> 1452.23s]  This is gender neutral restroom.
[1452.23s -> 1454.24s]  OK, that's all right.
[1454.24s -> 1455.24s]  That's cool.
[1455.24s -> 1456.24s]  OK.
[1456.24s -> 1458.24s]  How many zones can I make and unlimited amount?
[1458.24s -> 1459.24s]  Could I have like a thousand cash rooms?
[1459.24s -> 1465.34s]  Could I have?
[1465.34s -> 1466.34s]  OK.
[1466.34s -> 1470.78s]  My plan is to have like 20 cash rooms and I only have one of them have money in them.
[1470.78s -> 1473.21s]  You want to come rob my casino?
[1474.21s -> 1477.21s]  You better you better get the right one because it's going to be a maze for you.
[1477.21s -> 1481.07s]  This music is nice.
[1481.07s -> 1485.19s]  Yeah, it is.
[1485.19s -> 1486.82s]  Hold on.
[1486.82s -> 1487.82s]  Let me see.
[1487.82s -> 1489.06s]  Because this is to create.
[1489.06s -> 1490.06s]  Where was it?
[1490.06s -> 1493.60s]  It was here somewhere.
[1493.60s -> 1494.60s]  Oh, D zone.
[1494.60s -> 1495.60s]  OK.
[1495.60s -> 1497.03s]  All right.
[1497.03s -> 1498.03s]  Cool.
[1498.03s -> 1500.36s]  Let's add a bingo hall.
[1500.36s -> 1501.36s]  Well, you know it.
[1501.36s -> 1502.36s]  Create a bingo hall.
[1502.36s -> 1504.86s]  Find entertainment in the build menu or search for bingo.
[1504.86s -> 1509.35s]  Drag an area inside the building that meets the minimum required size or shift to quickly
[1509.35s -> 1510.35s]  fill the whole room.
[1510.35s -> 1511.35s]  Let's go.
[1511.35s -> 1514.06s]  Bingo.
[1514.06s -> 1524.78s]  Bingo.
[1524.78s -> 1525.78s]  Wait.
[1525.78s -> 1530.06s]  Oh, bingo hall zone.
[1530.06s -> 1533.93s]  You got it.
[1533.93s -> 1537.22s]  Cool.
[1537.22s -> 1539.22s]  Check which objects you need by hovering over the zone.
[1539.22s -> 1541.22s]  Ah, all right.
[1541.22s -> 1542.22s]  We need this is cool.
[1542.22s -> 1543.22s]  All right.
[1543.22s -> 1544.22s]  We need a bingo podium.
[1544.22s -> 1550.82s]  Man, man, can you imagine?
[1550.82s -> 1552.32s]  Never mind.
[1552.32s -> 1554.20s]  Shh.
[1554.20s -> 1555.20s]  Quiet.
[1555.20s -> 1558.81s]  Hey, everybody be quiet.
[1558.81s -> 1560.05s]  Hey, quiet.
[1560.05s -> 1564.94s]  Hey, can you imagine if, you know, quiet?
[1564.94s -> 1567.39s]  OK.
[1567.39s -> 1572.22s]  I gotta be careful here.
[1572.22s -> 1574.22s]  I gotta be careful here.
[1574.22s -> 1576.22s]  I'm getting I'm treading on water.
[1576.22s -> 1577.39s]  I shouldn't be.
[1577.39s -> 1578.39s]  All right.
[1578.39s -> 1579.39s]  I need a bingo podium.
[1579.39s -> 1583.96s]  I guess I can just type, right?
[1583.96s -> 1584.96s]  Bingo.
[1584.96s -> 1589.40s]  Bingo.
[1589.40s -> 1590.40s]  Two thousand dollars.
[1590.40s -> 1596.44s]  How do you rotate?
[1596.44s -> 1597.44s]  Oh, there we are.
[1597.44s -> 1602.82s]  Cool.
[1602.82s -> 1613.58s]  Uh, and then I need bingo seating.
[1613.58s -> 1616.58s]  Waiting for a delivery of payout receipt by a workman.
[1616.58s -> 1618.58s]  Check you have enough stock assigned.
[1618.58s -> 1619.58s]  Wait, what is this?
[1619.58s -> 1628.54s]  I can't even understand what this is trying to tell me.
[1628.54s -> 1629.54s]  What are they?
[1629.54s -> 1636.47s]  What are they doing here?
[1636.47s -> 1642.96s]  They didn't even do anything.
[1642.96s -> 1643.96s]  Moving crate.
[1643.96s -> 1644.96s]  What did they do?
[1644.96s -> 1648.12s]  They didn't do anything.
[1648.12s -> 1650.77s]  OK.
[1650.77s -> 1651.77s]  What else needs to be here?
[1651.77s -> 1661.84s]  Bingo card counter.
[1661.84s -> 1662.84s]  Cool.
[1662.84s -> 1666.06s]  All right.
[1666.06s -> 1667.06s]  I get it.
[1667.06s -> 1669.07s]  I get it.
[1669.07s -> 1670.07s]  I get it.
[1670.07s -> 1671.31s]  Malicious compliance workers.
[1671.31s -> 1672.31s]  All right.
[1672.31s -> 1673.31s]  I get it.
[1673.31s -> 1674.31s]  That's fun.
[1674.31s -> 1675.31s]  You can customize designs and colors of walls with the paint tool.
[1675.31s -> 1676.31s]  Hold on.
[1676.31s -> 1677.31s]  Control it.
[1677.31s -> 1678.31s]  Damn.
[1678.31s -> 1682.56s]  This soundtrack actually is goes fucking hard.
[1682.56s -> 1683.56s]  OK.
[1683.56s -> 1684.56s]  With the paint tool.
[1684.56s -> 1685.56s]  Hold down and control.
[1685.56s -> 1691.92s]  All right.
[1691.92s -> 1695.14s]  So let's do some painting.
[1695.14s -> 1696.14s]  Where's the paint tool?
[1696.14s -> 1698.15s]  Paint tool.
[1698.15s -> 1699.15s]  You guys see a paint tool?
[1699.15s -> 1702.03s]  Somebody else tell me where this other is.
[1702.03s -> 1703.03s]  OK.
[1703.03s -> 1704.03s]  All right.
[1704.03s -> 1705.03s]  Oh, all right.
[1705.03s -> 1706.03s]  I'm into this.
[1706.03s -> 1707.03s]  I'm into this a lot.
[1707.03s -> 1708.03s]  That's fine.
[1708.03s -> 1710.74s]  Cool.
[1710.74s -> 1711.74s]  What about the...
[1711.74s -> 1712.74s]  Can I do the carpet?
[1712.74s -> 1715.74s]  I have to be able to do the carpets, right?
[1715.74s -> 1719.84s]  Look at the floors, too.
[1719.84s -> 1722.84s]  Oh, to do matching floor.
[1722.84s -> 1731.33s]  Hold control just like the matching floor.
[1731.33s -> 1732.33s]  Matching floor.
[1732.33s -> 1734.66s]  How do I do that?
[1734.66s -> 1735.66s]  Is there already people playing bingo?
[1735.66s -> 1747.42s]  How much does this cost?
[1747.42s -> 1748.42s]  OK.
[1748.42s -> 1749.42s]  I want bricks on the ground.
[1749.42s -> 1750.42s]  How do I do that?
[1750.42s -> 1753.96s]  Hold shift.
[1753.96s -> 1754.96s]  Hold control.
[1754.96s -> 1759.38s]  I don't get it.
[1759.38s -> 1760.38s]  Hold control.
[1760.38s -> 1762.13s]  Oh, come on.
[1763.13s -> 1764.13s]  That was...
[1764.13s -> 1765.13s]  I half-assed.
[1765.13s -> 1766.13s]  That one's so bad.
[1766.13s -> 1768.13s]  Oh, come on, Gun.
[1768.13s -> 1771.13s]  I don't even care anymore.
[1771.13s -> 1775.14s]  OK, there we go.
[1775.14s -> 1782.17s]  I love that phrase, but I really didn't give it any effort at all.
[1782.17s -> 1783.17s]  OK.
[1783.17s -> 1785.17s]  Move a single object or...
[1785.17s -> 1786.17s]  Yep, yep, yep.
[1786.17s -> 1792.75s]  Move a single object or drag multi-selected and move multiple objects.
[1792.75s -> 1794.63s]  Oh, shit.
[1794.63s -> 1795.63s]  OK.
[1795.63s -> 1798.97s]  Move.
[1798.97s -> 1799.97s]  Oh, that's actually pretty.
[1799.97s -> 1800.97s]  That's useful.
[1800.97s -> 1802.98s]  That's useful.
[1802.98s -> 1807.05s]  Copy an object with the eyedropper.
[1807.05s -> 1809.50s]  Sick.
[1809.50s -> 1810.50s]  Yep.
[1810.50s -> 1819.42s]  Clone an area with the clone tool and you can clone the whole thing.
[1819.42s -> 1820.42s]  Whoa.
[1820.42s -> 1823.07s]  All right.
[1823.07s -> 1827.17s]  That's very helpful.
[1827.17s -> 1832.17s]  Finally, you can click copy on any designer tool and click paste on another object designer tool.
[1832.17s -> 1837.34s]  You can also copy certain settings and use multi-selected many objects.
[1837.34s -> 1838.34s]  Stop doing that.
[1838.34s -> 1841.34s]  I'm going to give myself another headache and paste the settings multi-selected.
[1841.34s -> 1842.34s]  I don't think I need to do that.
[1842.34s -> 1843.34s]  My brain is too small for that.
[1843.34s -> 1845.34s]  I don't care.
[1845.34s -> 1848.50s]  All right.
[1848.50s -> 1850.50s]  A successful casino.
[1850.50s -> 1851.68s]  Do we know?
[1851.68s -> 1853.68s]  I think we pretty much know what we're doing.
[1853.68s -> 1856.50s]  I'm going to go through this pretty quickly.
[1856.50s -> 1857.50s]  Wait.
[1857.50s -> 1858.50s]  Delete.
[1858.50s -> 1862.08s]  Slime machines are fundamentally a success.
[1862.08s -> 1863.08s]  Some have been built already.
[1863.08s -> 1867.08s]  If you haven't destroyed them, of course, you can change the game type, which affects its stats.
[1867.08s -> 1868.08s]  Ooh.
[1868.08s -> 1876.62s]  Play.
[1876.62s -> 1877.62s]  It's a dollar to play it.
[1877.62s -> 1878.62s]  OK.
[1878.62s -> 1881.62s]  Jackpot chance is five percent.
[1881.62s -> 1883.62s]  Jackpot is ten dollars.
[1883.62s -> 1884.62s]  What a terrible jackpot.
[1884.62s -> 1887.62s]  This needs to be fucking like a fucking million.
[1887.62s -> 1888.62s]  House advantage.
[1888.62s -> 1889.62s]  I don't know.
[1889.62s -> 1890.62s]  Five.
[1890.62s -> 1894.93s]  OK.
[1894.93s -> 1901.67s]  OK.
[1901.67s -> 1902.67s]  Slime machines are fundamental.
[1902.67s -> 1903.67s]  OK.
[1903.67s -> 1905.67s]  Click on a slot machine and switch to game settings and tap.
[1905.67s -> 1906.67s]  Yeah.
[1906.67s -> 1909.83s]  OK.
[1909.83s -> 1910.83s]  Cool.
[1910.83s -> 1911.83s]  Gamblers have a confidence score.
[1911.83s -> 1917.83s]  New gamblers generally enter with a low confidence score, and this is increased when they win or push in games.
[1917.83s -> 1921.83s]  The higher the pay play cost, the more confidence they need to try it.
[1921.83s -> 1924.83s]  To avoid alienating new players, it's good to have a variety of play costs.
[1924.83s -> 1927.58s]  Increase the play cost to one dollar.
[1927.58s -> 1929.58s]  Note the confidence value.
[1929.58s -> 1932.10s]  OK.
[1932.10s -> 1934.10s]  Zero to two point four.
[1934.10s -> 1936.10s]  So what if I made this like ten bucks?
[1936.10s -> 1939.71s]  OK.
[1939.71s -> 1945.15s]  This OST is Jerry Martin.
[1945.15s -> 1947.15s]  It's the original composer of Sims 1.
[1947.15s -> 1948.15s]  Is that legitimate?
[1948.15s -> 1949.15s]  Are you for real?
[1949.15s -> 1952.03s]  Because that's pretty fucking cool if you're accurate.
[1952.03s -> 1953.98s]  All right.
[1953.98s -> 1955.98s]  House advantage has got to be more than that, but whatever.
[1955.98s -> 1957.98s]  We're just doing the tutorial.
[1957.98s -> 1961.52s]  House advantage is how we make a profit.
[1961.52s -> 1966.52s]  Imagine a coin toss where you pay one dollar with a 50 percent chance of winning back two dollars.
[1966.52s -> 1969.52s]  On average, you would break even, and the edge is zero percent.
[1969.52s -> 1976.52s]  Charge commission on those winnings will replace it with a biased coin that lands on our side more frequently, and we would have an advantage.
[1976.52s -> 1979.82s]  Remember that if players lose too often, they will get frustrated.
[1979.82s -> 1980.82s]  OK.
[1980.82s -> 1984.47s]  Copy these settings to at least four other slots.
[1984.47s -> 1985.47s]  How do I do that?
[1985.47s -> 1990.62s]  Copy game settings to bingo.
[1990.62s -> 1991.62s]  Copy.
[1991.62s -> 1994.54s]  But how do I do that?
[1994.54s -> 1997.19s]  Oh, got it.
[1997.19s -> 1998.19s]  Paste game settings.
[1998.19s -> 2000.97s]  What the hell?
[2000.97s -> 2006.82s]  What the hell?
[2006.82s -> 2015.35s]  What the hell?
[2015.35s -> 2022.86s]  Copy game settings.
[2022.86s -> 2026.28s]  How do I paste?
[2026.28s -> 2032.62s]  Paste game settings, right?
[2032.62s -> 2038.46s]  What the hell?
[2038.46s -> 2049.64s]  Control C, control V, control C.
[2049.64s -> 2051.94s]  Oh, that's not how you do it.
[2051.94s -> 2053.94s]  I mean, I'm very clearly doing it.
[2053.94s -> 2057.81s]  Ten bucks.
[2057.81s -> 2060.07s]  Jackpot.
[2060.07s -> 2061.07s]  Thousand.
[2061.07s -> 2063.70s]  House advantage.
[2063.70s -> 2064.70s]  Ten percent, right?
[2064.70s -> 2066.70s]  Like, OK, copy settings and paste it to everything.
[2067.70s -> 2072.74s]  That had to have done it.
[2072.74s -> 2077.62s]  What?
[2077.62s -> 2083.13s]  He's never used the keyboard.
[2083.13s -> 2087.22s]  Um, hundred dollars.
[2087.22s -> 2089.17s]  Player cost.
[2089.17s -> 2090.17s]  One dollar.
[2090.17s -> 2092.73s]  Oh, OK.
[2092.73s -> 2093.73s]  And whatever.
[2093.73s -> 2096.10s]  That had to be the exact thing.
[2096.10s -> 2097.10s]  I just whatever.
[2097.10s -> 2098.10s]  I get it.
[2098.10s -> 2099.66s]  I get it.
[2099.66s -> 2100.66s]  I get it.
[2100.66s -> 2101.66s]  Payout receipt by a workman.
[2101.66s -> 2103.66s]  And when a gambler wins, the machine will print out a payout receipt.
[2103.66s -> 2107.66s]  The gambler will take this to the ATM to collect their cash as long as they don't forget.
[2107.66s -> 2112.66s]  Thought machines have electricity costs and require a higher confidence to play for low play cost amounts at first.
[2112.66s -> 2115.66s]  You can research high limit gambling and higher advantages.
[2115.66s -> 2116.66s]  All right.
[2116.66s -> 2119.41s]  Table games have a higher betting amounts.
[2119.41s -> 2121.41s]  I know what a casino is.
[2121.41s -> 2122.41s]  All right.
[2122.41s -> 2124.93s]  Let's build a cashier.
[2124.93s -> 2137.78s]  Cashier cage.
[2137.78s -> 2139.78s]  Build a table game.
[2139.78s -> 2144.43s]  A gambling tab.
[2144.43s -> 2145.43s]  OK.
[2145.43s -> 2149.25s]  How about a Texas Hold'em?
[2149.25s -> 2152.90s]  I don't know how to play this.
[2152.90s -> 2153.90s]  I don't like playing this.
[2153.90s -> 2161.49s]  Zone and build a pit boss office.
[2161.49s -> 2163.94s]  OK.
[2163.94s -> 2176.87s]  Pit boss office.
[2176.87s -> 2182.53s]  OK.
[2182.53s -> 2183.96s]  Failed.
[2183.96s -> 2184.96s]  Oh, OK.
[2184.96s -> 2185.96s]  Hold on.
[2185.96s -> 2187.58s]  We need a door.
[2187.58s -> 2195.67s]  OK.
[2195.67s -> 2197.68s]  We need a computer desk.
[2197.68s -> 2200.68s]  Requires to be protected behind a staff door.
[2200.68s -> 2201.68s]  Oh, whatever.
[2201.68s -> 2207.95s]  And now we need a computer desk.
[2207.95s -> 2211.54s]  Listen to the sounds.
[2211.54s -> 2215.59s]  OK.
[2215.59s -> 2218.18s]  Cool.
[2218.18s -> 2219.18s]  This is crazy.
[2219.18s -> 2227.86s]  A player's club desk will allow you to track info about your gamblers if they sign up.
[2227.86s -> 2230.86s]  Encourage them to sign up with a complimentary gift.
[2230.86s -> 2234.86s]  Once signed up, they can come back as repeat customers and retain their confidence level
[2234.86s -> 2235.86s]  for next time.
[2235.86s -> 2237.22s]  Nice.
[2237.22s -> 2238.22s]  All right.
[2238.22s -> 2239.22s]  Managing staff and crime.
[2239.22s -> 2240.98s]  Your staff handle the...
[2240.98s -> 2241.98s]  All right.
[2241.98s -> 2243.98s]  This music's too good for me to talk.
[2243.98s -> 2255.46s]  You're...
[2255.46s -> 2260.98s]  Jesus.
[2260.98s -> 2265.42s]  Are you done?
[2265.42s -> 2268.39s]  Have you finished?
[2268.39s -> 2269.39s]  OK.
[2269.39s -> 2270.76s]  We need to clap, I think.
[2270.76s -> 2275.76s]  I feel like everyone needs to clap because we've got to kind of get back to what we were
[2275.76s -> 2276.76s]  doing.
[2276.76s -> 2278.76s]  Your staff handle the operations of your casino.
[2278.76s -> 2283.76s]  They work at desks or drinks, watch for criminals, and drain your bank balance with their wages.
[2283.76s -> 2288.06s]  That's an odd way to word that last sentence.
[2288.06s -> 2289.06s]  OK.
[2289.06s -> 2290.06s]  There are a lot more...
[2290.06s -> 2291.06s]  If there are...
[2291.06s -> 2292.06s]  If there are...
[2292.06s -> 2293.06s]  I'm just...
[2293.06s -> 2297.52s]  I'm thinking the solo's going to come back and it's freaking me out.
[2297.52s -> 2299.52s]  There are a lot more tasks than staff.
[2299.52s -> 2300.52s]  A warning will show.
[2300.52s -> 2305.02s]  You should schedule more if the warning stays on for a long time.
[2305.02s -> 2307.02s]  Note that staff are automatically hired when scheduled.
[2307.02s -> 2309.02s]  There's no need to hire or fire staff.
[2309.02s -> 2311.02s]  You'll always have the right amount for your schedules.
[2311.02s -> 2312.02s]  OK.
[2312.02s -> 2313.02s]  That's kind of helpful.
[2313.02s -> 2315.92s]  All right.
[2315.92s -> 2316.92s]  Let's do it.
[2316.92s -> 2317.92s]  Let's take a look at the staff management screen.
[2317.92s -> 2322.92s]  On the right of it, let's see how many are a busy or idle on patrol.
[2322.92s -> 2326.92s]  As our casino gets bigger, we will likely need more...
[2326.92s -> 2327.92s]  Canada.
[2327.92s -> 2330.35s]  Add a garbage zone if you...
[2330.35s -> 2331.35s]  Fuck!
[2331.35s -> 2335.79s]  That was so bad.
[2335.79s -> 2343.26s]  I was trying to do, like, to the music.
[2343.26s -> 2344.26s]  You know what?
[2344.26s -> 2346.26s]  I could have done it, but when stuff doesn't rhyme...
[2346.26s -> 2348.26s]  It feels weird to sing it.
[2348.26s -> 2351.33s]  You know what I'm saying?
[2351.33s -> 2356.33s]  You know, if something rhymes, it's like a song.
[2356.33s -> 2360.33s]  The last word usually rhymes, but I can't do it right here.
[2360.33s -> 2361.33s]  Do it again?
[2361.33s -> 2363.33s]  I'll try it again.
[2363.33s -> 2367.82s]  But it has to be in, like, a poem format.
[2367.82s -> 2371.56s]  OK.
[2371.56s -> 2373.56s]  Oh, this is embarrassing.
[2373.56s -> 2375.56s]  And that's why I'm at...
[2375.56s -> 2377.56s]  You're making me do this because it's embarrassing.
[2377.56s -> 2378.56s]  OK.
[2378.56s -> 2379.56s]  Press unassigned key.
[2379.56s -> 2382.56s]  Or find the button on the bottom menu bar.
[2382.56s -> 2384.56s]  Stack of operations menu.
[2384.56s -> 2388.81s]  OK.
[2388.81s -> 2393.86s]  The staff type is automatically hired.
[2393.86s -> 2395.86s]  Click on their placed object or zones to edit.
[2395.86s -> 2396.86s]  OK.
[2396.86s -> 2397.86s]  Garbage.
[2397.86s -> 2400.83s]  Scheduled hours.
[2400.83s -> 2402.84s]  All right.
[2402.84s -> 2403.84s]  So we have...
[2403.84s -> 2405.84s]  From 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., there are two...
[2405.84s -> 2407.84s]  There are two janitors?
[2407.84s -> 2409.53s]  Add schedule.
[2409.53s -> 2410.53s]  All right.
[2410.53s -> 2413.69s]  All right.
[2413.69s -> 2414.69s]  This is pretty...
[2414.69s -> 2417.14s]  I get it.
[2417.14s -> 2425.50s]  What about the housekeeping schedule screen?
[2425.50s -> 2426.50s]  Housekeeping...
[2426.50s -> 2427.87s]  Where is that?
[2427.87s -> 2433.14s]  Oh, OK.
[2433.14s -> 2434.14s]  This is it right there.
[2434.14s -> 2435.14s]  All right.
[2435.14s -> 2438.11s]  Cool.
[2438.11s -> 2440.11s]  Look at when the janitors will arrive during the weekend and the weekends.
[2440.11s -> 2443.11s]  By default, weekdays and weekends use the same schedule.
[2443.11s -> 2444.11s]  Does it help?
[2444.11s -> 2445.11s]  I guess number three.
[2445.11s -> 2448.02s]  OK.
[2448.02s -> 2449.96s]  Easy.
[2449.96s -> 2450.96s]  You do not need to hire these new janitors.
[2450.96s -> 2454.96s]  They are hired automatically when you schedule extra workmen, guards, and chefs.
[2454.96s -> 2456.96s]  There are chefs in the game, by the way.
[2456.96s -> 2457.96s]  Everybody relax.
[2457.96s -> 2466.90s]  Setting up your staffed objects like cashier cages, bars, and desks is simpler.
[2467.90s -> 2470.90s]  Schedule editor is basically the same, but you toggle the open close hours instead of
[2470.90s -> 2471.90s]  the number of staff.
[2471.90s -> 2472.90s]  They're also hired automatically.
[2472.90s -> 2474.39s]  OK.
[2474.39s -> 2476.14s]  I'll figure this out later.
[2476.14s -> 2477.14s]  You can set patrols up.
[2477.14s -> 2478.32s]  OK.
[2478.32s -> 2480.39s]  I'll figure this out later.
[2480.39s -> 2481.39s]  All right.
[2481.39s -> 2484.10s]  I'll figure this out later.
[2484.10s -> 2485.10s]  I'll figure this out later.
[2485.10s -> 2486.10s]  All right.
[2486.10s -> 2492.71s]  We can do area patrols or the security guard over the front door.
[2492.71s -> 2499.46s]  All right.
[2499.46s -> 2500.46s]  This makes sense, doesn't it?
[2500.46s -> 2501.46s]  That makes sense, right?
[2501.46s -> 2502.46s]  OK.
[2502.46s -> 2507.98s]  That's good.
[2507.98s -> 2508.98s]  That's good.
[2508.98s -> 2511.44s]  That looks good.
[2511.44s -> 2512.44s]  That looks good.
[2512.44s -> 2518.46s]  Oh, it's like drink servers.
[2518.46s -> 2520.21s]  Oh, OK.
[2520.21s -> 2522.70s]  So we can make them go like this, right?
[2522.70s -> 2526.70s]  Because they're going to start here at the bar and they're going to go, yoink, and then
[2526.70s -> 2529.22s]  they're going to go like this.
[2529.22s -> 2533.06s]  This is going to walk around.
[2533.06s -> 2535.70s]  This thing.
[2535.70s -> 2536.70s]  At least four points.
[2536.70s -> 2542.03s]  Oh, come on.
[2542.03s -> 2543.03s]  And then back over.
[2543.03s -> 2544.03s]  I don't know.
[2544.03s -> 2545.03s]  Over here to this table.
[2545.03s -> 2550.11s]  Yeah.
[2550.11s -> 2551.11s]  All right.
[2551.11s -> 2562.08s]  Looks good.
[2562.08s -> 2565.88s]  Free the person in the bathroom?
[2565.88s -> 2566.88s]  What do you mean?
[2566.88s -> 2569.91s]  Hungry, thirsty, bored.
[2569.91s -> 2570.91s]  Wait.
[2570.91s -> 2571.91s]  I am this person now?
[2571.91s -> 2578.02s]  You can run?
[2578.02s -> 2582.26s]  All right.
[2582.26s -> 2585.26s]  This is inverted mouse controls, by the way.
[2585.26s -> 2593.80s]  That's kind of funny.
[2593.80s -> 2597.79s]  OK.
[2597.79s -> 2598.79s]  OK.
[2598.79s -> 2601.79s]  Pit Bosses can be set on patrol to calm the frustrated players of slot machines and table
[2601.79s -> 2602.79s]  games.
[2602.79s -> 2604.79s]  They also look out for hackers and cheaters near them.
[2604.79s -> 2606.29s]  Security guards are a lot different.
[2606.29s -> 2610.29s]  They look out for thieves, hackers, and cheaters, and can chase them, too.
[2610.29s -> 2614.29s]  You'll want them spread around your casino so they will be standing in ideal locations
[2614.29s -> 2616.29s]  to capture criminals.
[2616.29s -> 2624.56s]  When you look at the recent crimes and the local crime rate, suburbs tend to have much
[2624.56s -> 2626.56s]  less crimes in the big city.
[2626.56s -> 2630.95s]  Oh, open the crimes overview screen.
[2630.95s -> 2634.15s]  What are all these people doing out here?
[2634.15s -> 2636.48s]  All right.
[2636.48s -> 2637.48s]  The crimes overview.
[2637.48s -> 2643.98s]  Woody Lane neighborhood crime five percent.
[2643.98s -> 2649.78s]  How many guards should chase down a single criminal?
[2649.78s -> 2650.78s]  Eight?
[2650.78s -> 2656.70s]  No.
[2656.70s -> 2657.70s]  That would be crazy.
[2657.70s -> 2661.50s]  One is fine.
[2661.50s -> 2666.50s]  The three main crime types are slot machine hackers, stalk thieves, and table game cheaters.
[2666.50s -> 2669.67s]  Thieves can hack your staff doors to access restricted places.
[2669.67s -> 2674.85s]  Cheaters take longer to detect and may win multiple times before getting noticed.
[2674.85s -> 2678.15s]  There's a good chance they will fail to cheat and end up losing more money than they started
[2678.15s -> 2679.15s]  with.
[2679.15s -> 2681.15s]  These failed attempts do not show up in the crime report.
[2681.15s -> 2686.25s]  Research security cameras, detect criminals.
[2686.25s -> 2687.94s]  Okay.
[2687.94s -> 2688.94s]  All right.
[2688.94s -> 2690.24s]  All right.
[2690.24s -> 2696.22s]  We are almost done.
[2696.22s -> 2698.35s]  We're almost done.
[2698.35s -> 2699.35s]  Free the lady.
[2699.35s -> 2700.35s]  What are you?
[2700.35s -> 2701.35s]  I don't have...
[2701.35s -> 2712.90s]  It's a tutorial.
[2712.90s -> 2717.78s]  I don't know what it said.
[2717.78s -> 2718.78s]  These are your recent thoughts.
[2718.78s -> 2721.66s]  I lost at the slot machine.
[2721.66s -> 2723.66s]  There were no nearby bin.
[2723.66s -> 2733.37s]  Not the fact that you've been trapped in the bathroom for like 12 hours.
[2733.37s -> 2735.37s]  Oh, it actually said the bar.
[2735.37s -> 2745.91s]  Can I play a machine?
[2745.91s -> 2750.03s]  Okay.
[2750.03s -> 2751.03s]  Open the...
[2751.03s -> 2752.66s]  What was it?
[2752.66s -> 2753.66s]  Manually delivery is enabled.
[2753.66s -> 2756.66s]  This means we need to set how much stock to order.
[2756.66s -> 2759.66s]  On the left is a graph showing current zone capacities.
[2759.66s -> 2763.92s]  And in the middle is all the stock types.
[2763.92s -> 2768.89s]  At the bottom of the screen, click on the truck.
[2768.89s -> 2779.96s]  Bedsheets, beer, betting tickets, table game chips, and soda.
[2779.96s -> 2780.96s]  Okay.
[2780.96s -> 2785.80s]  Set the target of payout receipts to at least six.
[2785.80s -> 2788.51s]  Payout receipts.
[2788.51s -> 2790.26s]  Six.
[2790.26s -> 2791.26s]  Six.
[2791.26s -> 2793.66s]  Okay.
[2793.66s -> 2796.24s]  Cool.
[2796.24s -> 2800.24s]  Let's say you have two crates of payout receipts in storage and a target of six.
[2800.24s -> 2804.24s]  In the next delivery, you would expect to see four additional crates.
[2804.24s -> 2808.24s]  If you ever have too much of something because of a higher target than the number of crates,
[2808.24s -> 2810.24s]  the excess will stay in your inventory.
[2810.24s -> 2812.74s]  You can click on crates to sell them.
[2812.74s -> 2813.74s]  Okay.
[2813.74s -> 2818.75s]  How long has he been streaming for?
[2818.75s -> 2819.75s]  I don't know, like 40 minutes.
[2819.75s -> 2821.75s]  I'm just chilling today.
[2821.75s -> 2822.75s]  Yeah, all right.
[2822.75s -> 2823.75s]  So now that there's enough people here...
[2823.75s -> 2825.75s]  Let me go over this one more time.
[2825.75s -> 2830.75s]  My green screen got moved to a different day because I didn't really feel that well.
[2830.75s -> 2836.75s]  And I don't want to make my headache worse by laughing every 15 seconds as hard as I
[2836.75s -> 2840.75s]  can, especially considering that there's a lot of shit going on this coming week.
[2840.75s -> 2841.75s]  And then baseball.
[2841.75s -> 2842.75s]  So don't worry.
[2842.75s -> 2843.75s]  We're still doing it.
[2843.75s -> 2844.75s]  We're still doing it.
[2844.75s -> 2849.75s]  I'm just moving it to like another, I don't know, maybe four, three or four days, maybe
[2849.75s -> 2850.75s]  next weekend.
[2850.75s -> 2851.75s]  Maybe...
[2851.75s -> 2853.18s]  I'll figure it out.
[2853.18s -> 2854.18s]  Don't worry.
[2854.18s -> 2855.18s]  We are going to do it.
[2855.18s -> 2856.18s]  Don't ask me.
[2856.18s -> 2857.18s]  It's...
[2857.18s -> 2858.18s]  I've been looking forward to it for a long time.
[2858.18s -> 2859.49s]  I'm not going to just skip it.
[2859.49s -> 2861.82s]  Okay.
[2861.82s -> 2863.63s]  But anyways.
[2863.63s -> 2864.63s]  All right.
[2864.63s -> 2866.19s]  Transport tab.
[2866.19s -> 2867.19s]  Supply truck comes...
[2867.19s -> 2868.19s]  All right.
[2868.19s -> 2869.19s]  So you can determine how often this shit comes.
[2869.19s -> 2871.20s]  All right.
[2871.20s -> 2872.20s]  I get it.
[2872.20s -> 2874.02s]  Most important stock is cash.
[2874.02s -> 2877.70s]  ATMs and cashier cages get filled regularly because they need to hand out cash when gamblers
[2877.70s -> 2879.26s]  win.
[2879.26s -> 2882.80s]  What if I don't have any cash?
[2882.80s -> 2883.80s]  Don't worry, guys.
[2883.80s -> 2886.72s]  He'll watch more videos and play Yakuza Zero and finish Red Dead 2.
[2886.72s -> 2888.02s]  All right.
[2888.02s -> 2893.22s]  But you can't take something from like four and a half years ago and say, hey, man, remember
[2893.22s -> 2899.23s]  when you didn't finish Red Dead 2 five years ago or whatever it was?
[2899.23s -> 2900.23s]  No.
[2900.23s -> 2901.23s]  You...
[2901.23s -> 2902.23s]  This is how it works.
[2902.23s -> 2906.11s]  You get to have a trailing six months of things to be upset about me with.
[2906.11s -> 2907.35s]  Right?
[2907.35s -> 2908.35s]  It's a trailing six months.
[2908.35s -> 2912.55s]  If it's been a year, I mean, come on.
[2912.55s -> 2913.99s]  I didn't play Yakuza Zero.
[2913.99s -> 2914.99s]  It's been a year.
[2914.99s -> 2916.03s]  It's been like two years.
[2916.03s -> 2917.11s]  You can't...
[2917.11s -> 2920.07s]  It's trailing six months.
[2920.07s -> 2921.07s]  Where's Paper Mario?
[2921.07s -> 2922.07s]  All right.
[2922.07s -> 2923.27s]  So that one, I understand.
[2923.27s -> 2926.99s]  I understand that one because I said, you know, within it, remember the trailing six
[2926.99s -> 2934.63s]  months that I would play it.
[2934.63s -> 2936.63s]  What about Sly Cooper?
[2936.63s -> 2937.75s]  I don't want to play.
[2937.75s -> 2941.12s]  I don't want to play Sly Cooper.
[2941.12s -> 2942.44s]  Here's why I don't want to play Sly Cooper.
[2942.44s -> 2947.00s]  I'm going to open the game and I'm going to do the first two levels and go, I don't really
[2947.00s -> 2948.56s]  care.
[2948.56s -> 2950.64s]  And I'm going to sit there and go, I remember this game was really fun.
[2950.64s -> 2954.84s]  This is like a really cool game back in like the fucking seventies when it came out and
[2954.84s -> 2955.84s]  it's cool.
[2955.84s -> 2958.04s]  But I'm going to get through the first three levels and go, all right.
[2958.48s -> 2959.48s]  That was some nostalgia.
[2959.48s -> 2961.30s]  That was fun.
[2961.30s -> 2963.86s]  And when I played Ratatouille, everyone was so excited for it.
[2963.86s -> 2971.65s]  And I played for three hours and I said, why this is OK, that was fun.
[2971.65s -> 2973.65s]  Sly Cooper is a great game.
[2973.65s -> 2974.65s]  It is.
[2974.65s -> 2979.09s]  I remember playing it when I was younger, but I would probably on stream, I'd probably
[2979.09s -> 2980.09s]  be like, all right, let's go.
[2980.09s -> 2984.17s]  And then I would get like through like an hour and a half in and be like, oh shit, I
[2984.17s -> 2985.17s]  got to shit.
[2985.17s -> 2986.17s]  I've got to take a shit.
[2986.17s -> 2987.17s]  I've got to leave guys.
[2987.17s -> 2988.17s]  I got to take a shit.
[2988.17s -> 2989.17s]  I would take a big poop.
[2989.17s -> 2995.86s]  And I would leave and then I would go to Holly after and go, man, that game, that game was
[2996.82s -> 2997.82s]  as bad as I remember.
[2997.82s -> 3000.34s]  Was it as bad as I remember?
[3000.34s -> 3001.34s]  I thought it was good.
[3001.34s -> 3016.14s]  And I'll just rant for like an hour and 25 minutes.
[3016.14s -> 3019.22s]  It's a totally completely fabricated scenario.
[3019.22s -> 3021.10s]  All right.
[3021.10s -> 3022.10s]  Stop.
[3022.10s -> 3024.10s]  I have to get to that of the tutorial so I can play.
[3024.10s -> 3026.49s]  All right.
[3026.49s -> 3027.49s]  Let's open.
[3027.49s -> 3028.49s]  Let's open the cash screen.
[3028.49s -> 3034.14s]  OK.
[3034.14s -> 3041.03s]  So this is how much cash like this is my cash management.
[3041.03s -> 3048.50s]  Lower the rate guards empty machines to less than 30 percent.
[3048.50s -> 3049.50s]  Now why is that?
[3049.54s -> 3053.42s]  The guards should attempt to empty objects holding cash when they have this full.
[3053.42s -> 3061.21s]  I get this 2500 bucks in machines and this 2500 bucks in the casino.
[3061.21s -> 3062.21s]  Cash in the bank.
[3062.21s -> 3063.21s]  Seven hundred eighty five thousand.
[3063.21s -> 3068.46s]  You are a background character in Friends.
[3068.46s -> 3075.78s]  Are you saying that because I'm one of the people that just says nonsense and moves their
[3075.78s -> 3084.94s]  mouth talking with a drink in their hand while like they do the scene in front of us?
[3085.14s -> 3090.10s]  What you're describing is I'm the person that I have that exact same conversation with one
[3090.10s -> 3095.90s]  of the other extras and it looks like I'm really talking and moving my hands.
[3095.90s -> 3097.58s]  But I said almost nothing.
[3097.58s -> 3100.22s]  That was I said almost nothing.
[3100.22s -> 3101.90s]  Is that what you meant by that statement?
[3101.90s -> 3106.02s]  No, you bet your ass.
[3106.02s -> 3109.14s]  You bet your ass I would look directly in the camera.
[3109.14s -> 3115.82s]  If I was ever in if I was ever in like a background actor in one of these shows, the camera's
[3115.82s -> 3121.08s]  going to go by and look directly in the lens and they're going to edit it and they're going
[3121.08s -> 3123.88s]  to be like, what the fuck, dude?
[3123.88s -> 3125.44s]  This guy looked right into the lens.
[3125.44s -> 3127.48s]  He looked right into the camera.
[3127.48s -> 3133.07s]  Why?
[3133.07s -> 3140.66s]  The one thing they teach you in like acting school is the camera does not exist.
[3140.66s -> 3145.66s]  And any time you like look into the lens, it's like it's like playing operation.
[3145.66s -> 3147.70s]  It's like, nope, wrong, wrong.
[3147.70s -> 3153.90s]  All right, let's go.
[3153.90s -> 3154.90s]  Let's go.
[3154.94s -> 3155.94s]  We got it.
[3155.94s -> 3156.94s]  We're done.
[3156.94s -> 3158.75s]  I'm ready.
[3158.75s -> 3167.10s]  It's time to make our casino.
[3167.10s -> 3168.10s]  All right.
[3168.10s -> 3170.42s]  New.
[3170.42s -> 3172.11s]  Here we go.
[3172.11s -> 3174.59s]  Instant research, auto delivery, instant staff.
[3174.59s -> 3175.59s]  That's fine.
[3175.59s -> 3177.09s]  Watch.
[3177.09s -> 3178.46s]  How much money should I start with?
[3178.46s -> 3197.35s]  I'm going to say I'm going to say clean, cool, one million, clean, cool, one million.
[3197.35s -> 3200.62s]  So cool.
[3200.62s -> 3203.12s]  Is Mr. Green's back?
[3203.12s -> 3208.14s]  Well, well, stop talking.
[3208.14s -> 3209.14s]  Stop talking.
[3209.14s -> 3210.83s]  You're gonna get me in trouble.
[3210.83s -> 3211.83s]  All right.
[3212.47s -> 3213.47s]  How about just me?
[3213.47s -> 3217.33s]  All right.
[3217.33s -> 3218.33s]  Pre-built starter map.
[3218.33s -> 3229.91s]  No, I want to make my own.
[3229.91s -> 3232.40s]  We know you don't know.
[3232.40s -> 3233.94s]  You don't have any idea.
[3233.94s -> 3235.37s]  All right.
[3235.37s -> 3236.37s]  So this is where we're going to go.
[3236.37s -> 3237.55s]  132,000.
[3237.55s -> 3238.55s]  What's going on?
[3238.55s -> 3246.33s]  Is the fucking meteor hitting?
[3246.33s -> 3247.33s]  Oh, OK.
[3247.33s -> 3248.33s]  Why is it getting so dark?
[3248.33s -> 3250.28s]  Why did we hit the shadow?
[3250.28s -> 3251.28s]  What is this?
[3251.28s -> 3252.28s]  Oh, it's over here.
[3252.28s -> 3253.28s]  Oh, I like this.
[3253.28s -> 3257.40s]  279,000.
[3257.40s -> 3259.98s]  Isn't this a hotel?
[3259.98s -> 3260.98s]  All right.
[3260.98s -> 3261.98s]  So I make a hotel.
[3261.98s -> 3263.28s]  OK.
[3263.28s -> 3264.28s]  I'm going to buy these both.
[3264.28s -> 3274.42s]  This is going to be the hotel and this is going to be the casino.
[3274.42s -> 3275.42s]  All right.
[3275.42s -> 3276.42s]  Let's start here and go.
[3276.42s -> 3277.42s]  279,000.
[3277.42s -> 3278.42s]  You have no parking.
[3278.42s -> 3279.42s]  All right.
[3279.42s -> 3280.42s]  Here's what I want to do.
[3280.42s -> 3281.79s]  I want to have.
[3281.79s -> 3282.79s]  All right.
[3282.79s -> 3283.79s]  What is this music?
[3283.79s -> 3284.79s]  This is nice.
[3284.79s -> 3294.60s]  OK.
[3294.60s -> 3296.93s]  Look at this area we got to work with.
[3296.93s -> 3297.93s]  All right.
[3297.93s -> 3299.68s]  This is this is huge.
[3299.68s -> 3301.44s]  Oh, my goodness.
[3301.44s -> 3302.61s]  This is way too much.
[3302.61s -> 3305.39s]  This is too big.
[3305.39s -> 3307.33s]  This is too big.
[3307.33s -> 3308.33s]  This is too big.
[3308.33s -> 3309.33s]  This is too big.
[3309.33s -> 3310.33s]  This is too big.
[3310.33s -> 3311.33s]  This is too big.
[3311.33s -> 3312.33s]  Oh, my goodness.
[3312.33s -> 3314.60s]  This is way too much.
[3314.60s -> 3315.60s]  This is too big.
[3315.60s -> 3318.24s]  Uh, OK.
[3318.24s -> 3331.65s]  Um, let's just make a I'm going to have this is the big lobby, right?
[3331.65s -> 3334.85s]  Lobby is going to go off to the hotel.
[3334.85s -> 3343.74s]  So let's do here is this just opener that is huge is going to be a big lobby and then
[3343.74s -> 3345.22s]  leading over this way is the hotels.
[3345.22s -> 3348.47s]  So it's going to go yoink.
[3348.47s -> 3358.24s]  You need to start a war with pasta Italiano fucking crazy.
[3358.24s -> 3365.32s]  I wish they would remake that game, dude.
[3365.64s -> 3371.52s]  For those of you that new viewers that don't know what that is, Casino Inc is one of the
[3371.52s -> 3378.11s]  most outrageous video games I think it's ever been made, that it's I can't even explain
[3378.11s -> 3379.11s]  it.
[3379.11s -> 3380.11s]  Just you need to go.
[3380.11s -> 3381.11s]  You need to go watch the VOD.
[3381.11s -> 3382.11s]  That's all I can tell.
[3382.11s -> 3385.99s]  I'll go download it and play it on your own and just spoiler free and be like, holy shit.
[3385.99s -> 3387.61s]  What the hell were they doing?
[3387.61s -> 3389.11s]  It's like almost a perfect video game.
[3389.11s -> 3391.37s]  All right.
[3391.37s -> 3392.37s]  So let's go over this way.
[3392.37s -> 3407.04s]  This is going to be the hallway leading to the hotel.
[3407.04s -> 3409.28s]  And this would be a these would be a bunch of rooms here.
[3410.80s -> 3413.95s]  So this is like, all right, is the hallway then?
[3421.12s -> 3422.56s]  And I just wait, I just do a big.
[3423.36s -> 3425.72s]  Can I separate the rooms like, wait, hold on.
[3433.69s -> 3434.69s]  Oh, I can do that.
[3434.69s -> 3437.02s]  All right. Let me do that.
[3442.86s -> 3446.34s]  Never mind. I like that's going to be the table games room.
[3449.82s -> 3459.96s]  This will be the hallway to the hotel alone.
[3474.64s -> 3477.28s]  Delete this. If my how much do I get my money back if I delete stuff?
[3490.08s -> 3492.80s]  I don't get my money back if I don't if I do this.
[3495.80s -> 3496.80s]  How come I don't get my money back?
[3501.24s -> 3503.52s]  Wait, actually, I just let's have like a staff room right here.
[3510.10s -> 3511.74s]  We're going to find your casino and playthrough.
[3511.74s -> 3516.97s]  Um, it's just be on YouTube on the Archive Channel.
[3519.17s -> 3520.77s]  OK, I need to figure this out.
[3520.77s -> 3521.97s]  This is way too big.
[3521.97s -> 3525.45s]  So this would be like a casino floor.
[3525.45s -> 3530.47s]  We add a wall here. Hold on.
[3530.47s -> 3532.79s]  Yeah, like this, I like a bathroom here, right?
[3535.00s -> 3536.00s]  It's bathroom.
[3539.53s -> 3543.83s]  What else is in a casino?
[3543.83s -> 3547.51s]  Is casino ink a good purchase?
[3547.51s -> 3551.67s]  You know, I don't know how well it runs on Windows 11
[3551.67s -> 3553.27s]  or 10 or anything, right?
[3553.27s -> 3555.47s]  Because I played it, what, three, two, three years ago.
[3556.64s -> 3558.92s]  Was even on Windows 10 two, three years ago.
[3558.92s -> 3565.72s]  I don't know. Does it still run?
[3565.72s -> 3569.34s]  OK, so that looks good.
[3569.34s -> 3572.97s]  I need to get rid of this because this is going to be slots.
[3574.01s -> 3576.95s]  This would be table games and this is going to be the hotel.
[3578.96s -> 3587.17s]  Jesus. All right.
[3587.17s -> 3598.84s]  Hotel. This hotel is right here and it's going to be sick.
[3607.91s -> 3611.19s]  Build. OK, here we go.
[3621.80s -> 3624.27s]  All right. To me, this is a trap.
[3624.27s -> 3628.80s]  Right. This feels like I'm going to walk in here
[3628.80s -> 3631.04s]  and it's going to the room's going to like spikes.
[3631.04s -> 3637.15s]  They're going to shoot out. Hold on.
[3637.15s -> 3641.12s]  Can I put this higher?
[3641.12s -> 3643.44s]  I don't know. Why is the ceiling so low?
[3644.55s -> 3648.27s]  I don't get it. I don't care. Whatever.
[3648.27s -> 3658.41s]  I need outdoor paint. I need an ATM.
[3658.41s -> 3661.63s]  All right. All right. Hold on.
[3661.63s -> 3668.88s]  You only have one floor.
[3668.88s -> 3677.44s]  This is some Hey Arnold shit. That's what I'm saying.
[3677.44s -> 3685.39s]  OK, I needed first of all, I need front door door
[3686.59s -> 3690.21s]  commercial double door.
[3690.21s -> 3695.84s]  You know, it's been one of these.
[3695.84s -> 3698.32s]  Oh, wait, this is this with a garbage.
[3698.60s -> 3701.16s]  I can't have the front door be where the trash gets taken out.
[3714.92s -> 3726.76s]  I feel like I'm making this in Roblox.
[3726.76s -> 3728.60s]  OK, that's fine for now.
[3728.60s -> 3735.98s]  Wait, I want this to be different.
[3735.98s -> 3740.12s]  Don't people make full video games in Roblox
[3741.03s -> 3743.92s]  that you can't even tell the difference?
[3743.92s -> 3745.64s]  You can't tell that it was made in Roblox
[3745.64s -> 3749.76s]  because every pixel has been changed to every single
[3750.32s -> 3752.56s]  every ounce of paint.
[3754.68s -> 3757.57s]  That's crazy.
[3757.57s -> 3759.57s]  That's ridiculous.
[3759.57s -> 3762.28s]  Something about that is really cool.
[3762.28s -> 3764.32s]  OK, so what's this?
[3764.32s -> 3782.69s]  Oh, that's better.
[3782.69s -> 3798.78s]  And they even get through that. No, delete that.
[3798.78s -> 3800.94s]  How do I get this looks stupid with the grass.
[3806.85s -> 3813.87s]  I need like a new floor.
[3813.87s -> 3821.58s]  Um, excuse me.
[3821.58s -> 3824.10s]  OK, floor terrain. There we go.
[3827.36s -> 3830.32s]  Oh, here you're going to get the red carpet experience.
[3856.37s -> 3861.83s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[3861.83s -> 3864.10s]  What are you talking about?
[3864.10s -> 3881.80s]  It's been indoor floor. Why? OK, well, that's annoying.
[3888.64s -> 3892.46s]  This is this saxophone.
[3892.46s -> 3893.94s]  I don't care. That's fine.
[3893.94s -> 3899.76s]  All right, let's do, um, combinations.
[3899.80s -> 3901.36s]  This is OK, hotel.
[3901.36s -> 3906.80s]  So this is I got to put a sign here, right?
[3906.80s -> 3915.04s]  Desk to sell rooms to you. Oh, here we go.
[3915.04s -> 3918.39s]  Wait, why is it like a Wizard of Oz door?
[3919.82s -> 3921.38s]  Hold on, move this.
[3921.38s -> 3923.58s]  I don't understand. Why is it like this?
[3932.99s -> 3941.28s]  All right, door and an interior door.
[3945.56s -> 3946.60s]  Holy shit. All right.
[3946.60s -> 3952.24s]  I need a bathroom to the indoor door.
[3952.92s -> 3961.44s]  Hotel room zone. OK, this is the hotels.
[3969.80s -> 3971.16s]  I need to move this a little bit.
[3971.16s -> 3973.84s]  Now, because this is where somebody at the window takes the they pay.
[3976.59s -> 3978.07s]  There's a washing machine.
[3978.07s -> 3980.79s]  All right. I need a door, just a door door.
[3985.52s -> 3990.11s]  Commercial single door there. All right.
[3995.52s -> 4000.00s]  This is not a single hotel room, right?
[4000.00s -> 4002.72s]  This room or one of the sub rooms should contain a bed.
[4006.32s -> 4008.84s]  This is a that's a no, it's not.
[4010.96s -> 4013.92s]  Well, whatever, we make it fucking ten grand a week to rent it out.
[4016.94s -> 4018.94s]  No, it's not. I can make a little sub rooms, it said.
[4020.35s -> 4022.80s]  All right, so I need a I need a staff.
[4022.80s -> 4024.64s]  This hotel requires a laundry zone.
[4024.64s -> 4028.38s]  No, it doesn't.
[4028.38s -> 4031.66s]  The hotel requires a laundry since when?
[4035.78s -> 4038.64s]  OK, well, laundry make the laundry zone.
[4040.22s -> 4042.02s]  We'll make that like over here.
[4042.02s -> 4060.44s]  Yeah, that's perfect over here.
[4060.48s -> 4065.92s]  OK, this is laundry.
[4065.92s -> 4074.21s]  Laundry can be reached from the bus stop.
[4076.28s -> 4077.76s]  Why do I care that it can?
[4077.76s -> 4080.60s]  I don't care.
[4080.60s -> 4083.32s]  Oh, it's just that it has to go door to door door door door.
[4083.32s -> 4084.96s]  I get you. OK, I understand.
[4084.96s -> 4086.28s]  All right. That's the laundry room.
[4086.28s -> 4087.24s]  Let me do this later.
[4087.24s -> 4088.80s]  Let's get the fucking casino games.
[4088.80s -> 4093.88s]  How much money do I have? I got money.
[4093.88s -> 4096.56s]  OK, laundry washing machine.
[4096.56s -> 4111.84s]  How many should I do like two or three?
[4111.84s -> 4114.60s]  OK, and then what else does this need?
[4114.88s -> 4119.39s]  Requires to be protected behind a staff door.
[4120.44s -> 4126.38s]  You got it. OK.
[4126.42s -> 4132.84s]  Add storage shelves to increase the capacity.
[4132.84s -> 4137.71s]  Easy. Wait, this side probably.
[4137.71s -> 4146.84s]  Yeah, we're here. Look at that.
[4146.84s -> 4150.20s]  And we'll put we'll put we'll put a painting.
[4150.20s -> 4151.54s]  All right. Cool.
[4151.54s -> 4157.10s]  Our laundry room is here.
[4157.10s -> 4165.43s]  How much does it cost to use the laundry room?
[4165.43s -> 4171.30s]  How much does this cost to use the laundry room?
[4171.30s -> 4173.78s]  Make the wallpaper very loud.
[4177.52s -> 4181.84s]  I will in a minute.
[4181.84s -> 4185.12s]  OK, first of all, we need to figure this out because this is messed up.
[4185.64s -> 4186.80s]  Yeah, this is all messed up.
[4186.80s -> 4189.12s]  I got to fix this immediately.
[4189.12s -> 4193.40s]  It's not what I wanted to do.
[4193.40s -> 4201.50s]  But god damn it, whatever.
[4201.50s -> 4211.38s]  How do I just I want to get rid of the wall?
[4211.38s -> 4219.34s]  How do I get rid of the wall?
[4219.34s -> 4220.58s]  I just want to get rid of the wall.
[4220.58s -> 4227.26s]  There we go. There we go.
[4227.26s -> 4230.43s]  Yeah, I don't I don't want a door.
[4230.43s -> 4234.07s]  When you move around a casino floor, you don't open up doors
[4234.35s -> 4241.58s]  to go to the next area. You just walk.
[4241.58s -> 4244.85s]  There's not a single steam room door.
[4245.25s -> 4254.64s]  No, it's just open.
[4254.64s -> 4256.80s]  But it has to be this because we have to pay to get in here.
[4261.87s -> 4262.83s]  Why is there no face cam?
[4262.83s -> 4268.18s]  Yeah, I don't really feel that well today.
[4268.18s -> 4270.62s]  I've been like really fucking sloppy recently.
[4270.66s -> 4273.82s]  That's another reason why the green screen is not tonight.
[4273.82s -> 4275.14s]  But I still wanted to stream.
[4275.14s -> 4280.58s]  I didn't want to just not stream because I want to stream.
[4280.78s -> 4284.75s]  It's fun. I enjoy it.
[4284.75s -> 4285.79s]  But we'll do it again.
[4285.79s -> 4287.43s]  We it's ready to go.
[4287.43s -> 4292.07s]  The playlist, I think, has our two playlist, I think, hundred and twenty videos.
[4293.41s -> 4296.50s]  So there's a lot to watch.
[4296.50s -> 4301.29s]  I just didn't want to start laughing and just pop a blow a gasket in my brain
[4302.01s -> 4304.73s]  and get a migraine, have to turn the stream off in half an hour.
[4304.73s -> 4310.77s]  You know what I mean? I'd rather just save it, especially considering
[4311.41s -> 4314.17s]  I need I want to be ready for baseball in like a week and a half.
[4314.17s -> 4316.32s]  So I just I got to be careful.
[4316.32s -> 4319.40s]  I don't want to mess anything up before doing the baseball stream.
[4322.09s -> 4326.99s]  All right. But anyway, let's go.
[4326.99s -> 4330.03s]  Oh, you.
[4342.50s -> 4346.44s]  What do I want to do?
[4346.44s -> 4350.61s]  What are you doing flying a spaceship?
[4350.61s -> 4352.81s]  You didn't know what that was.
[4352.81s -> 4357.56s]  Find that person out.
[4357.56s -> 4361.08s]  OK, let's I don't get overwhelmed by the blueprint.
[4361.52s -> 4369.32s]  Okay, let's, um...
[4369.32s -> 4372.01s]  I'm gonna do tables first. Table games.
[4372.01s -> 4376.24s]  Or should I do decorations first?
[4376.24s -> 4385.44s]  Yes. That's what we're doing.
[4385.44s -> 4391.71s]  Okay, floor. Carpet. Oh, there we go.
[4391.71s -> 4394.19s]  Alright, I want...
[4394.19s -> 4397.19s]  Ooh, that's cool looking, but I can't undo it, so I need to make sure I like it.
[4397.19s -> 4398.56s]  This is cool.
[4398.56s -> 4402.01s]  Dude, casino floors all have
[4402.01s -> 4405.00s]  this wild,
[4405.00s -> 4407.00s]  actually cool grandma carpet.
[4407.00s -> 4411.21s]  It's like if grandma
[4411.21s -> 4414.33s]  wore a hat backwards, and
[4414.33s -> 4416.51s]  like, rode a skateboard. That's the kind
[4416.51s -> 4418.51s]  of carpet that's in every casino.
[4418.51s -> 4425.40s]  Yuck. I like that.
[4425.40s -> 4431.74s]  Hold on. I'm not picking it yet.
[4431.74s -> 4435.88s]  That hurts my head. These are all just
[4435.88s -> 4441.37s]  magic eyes. Oh!
[4441.37s -> 4448.78s]  Oh! Oh! Yeah,
[4448.78s -> 4456.01s]  look at that. I don't want it to be the entire casino.
[4456.01s -> 4462.16s]  That's a bowling alley? Yeah, bowling
[4462.16s -> 4464.16s]  alleys and casinos are very similar.
[4464.16s -> 4468.12s]  That's true. Why
[4468.12s -> 4472.09s]  is that? You know, I think it's like the same
[4472.09s -> 4474.09s]  mindset of casino
[4474.09s -> 4478.25s]  design and bowling alley design. That's
[4478.25s -> 4485.61s]  true. And bus seats.
[4485.61s -> 4495.64s]  Yeah. Oh, I know. I know.
[4495.64s -> 4498.01s]  I hide the puke. Right?
[4498.01s -> 4502.67s]  Yeah. It makes
[4502.67s -> 4504.67s]  sure that it hides all the puke. If you
[4504.67s -> 4506.67s]  puke on this carpet,
[4506.67s -> 4513.96s]  no one's ever going to know. That's
[4513.96s -> 4515.96s]  a good... That's true. You're right.
[4515.96s -> 4519.23s]  Should it be that the whole way? No.
[4519.23s -> 4523.71s]  This one's kind of boring.
[4523.71s -> 4538.35s]  I like the blue.
[4538.35s -> 4542.76s]  The first one?
[4542.76s -> 4548.96s]  Wow. That could be in a different
[4548.96s -> 4551.13s]  room. Could that be the hotel room floor?
[4551.13s -> 4558.43s]  Oh, wood.
[4558.43s -> 4562.89s]  What about this wood? That looks all right.
[4571.64s -> 4573.64s]  Wait, what?
[4573.64s -> 4576.27s]  What?
[4576.27s -> 4585.66s]  How much is this?
[4585.66s -> 4594.88s]  $28,000. That's it?
[4594.88s -> 4597.88s]  That's so stupid. All right. I gotta
[4597.88s -> 4599.88s]  make a decision here. This is
[4599.88s -> 4602.44s]  indecisive. This is fine.
[4609.53s -> 4614.84s]  No, that's ugly. I like this
[4614.84s -> 4636.91s]  one. Yeah, this one's good.
[4636.91s -> 4639.21s]  Laser tag. Yeah, I mean,
[4639.21s -> 4641.21s]  it's starting to kind of look like a Nickelodeon
[4641.21s -> 4646.27s]  TV set. That's fine, though.
[4654.78s -> 4656.78s]  This has to go all the way to the wall.
[4656.78s -> 4658.78s]  This looks fucking ugly. Get it right.
[4658.78s -> 4660.78s]  Get it right or don't stream.
[4660.78s -> 4663.53s]  You know what I mean? Get it right or turn
[4663.53s -> 4666.86s]  off the stream.
[4666.86s -> 4668.86s]  Okay, walls.
[4668.86s -> 4671.68s]  How about just bricks?
[4671.68s -> 4683.71s]  I need an exterior.
[4683.71s -> 4699.63s]  Ooh, I kind of like that.
[4702.32s -> 4710.36s]  I like this.
[4710.36s -> 4712.36s]  It's so bad. Why? I like...
[4712.36s -> 4714.36s]  It looks fine. It looks cool.
[4714.36s -> 4728.94s]  What's the problem with that?
[4728.94s -> 4730.94s]  If my grandma had a mansion, it would look like this.
[4730.94s -> 4734.33s]  Yeah, and your grandma would be having the
[4734.33s -> 4739.84s]  time of her life there.
[4739.84s -> 4744.24s]  Let's continue.
[4744.24s -> 4747.12s]  We haven't even put the games in yet.
[4747.12s -> 4750.89s]  I need interior paint.
[4750.89s -> 4765.36s]  Wallpaper.
[4765.36s -> 4767.36s]  Patrons are complaining of headaches every time
[4767.36s -> 4772.73s]  they come to the casino.
[4772.73s -> 4775.23s]  Themed walls?
[4775.23s -> 4780.35s]  I mean, now it's a casino.
[4780.35s -> 4788.28s]  Every casino has to be
[4788.28s -> 4790.59s]  Caesar themed.
[4790.59s -> 4792.59s]  Or Roman.
[4792.59s -> 4797.56s]  Why is that?
[4797.56s -> 4799.56s]  Why does a bunch of casinos have to be
[4799.56s -> 4807.82s]  like, look where it's Roman?
[4807.82s -> 4810.19s]  You know three casinos.
[4810.19s -> 4812.19s]  No, that Roman kind of
[4812.19s -> 4815.88s]  architecture is everywhere down here.
[4815.88s -> 4826.64s]  Bro, I live here.
[4826.64s -> 4832.20s]  I don't live in a casino.
[4832.20s -> 4835.60s]  That was my actually moment.
[4835.60s -> 4837.96s]  I actually don't hate this.
[4837.96s -> 4844.92s]  Yeah, definitely this.
[4844.92s -> 4849.92s]  Definitely this.
[4849.92s -> 4863.55s]  That's perfect.
[4863.55s -> 4865.85s]  It's so ugly.
[4865.85s -> 4868.35s]  Most casinos are kind of ugly.
[4868.35s -> 4873.15s]  They just are. They're very tacky, a lot of them.
[4873.15s -> 4875.15s]  It's like Roman statues
[4875.15s -> 4877.15s]  and bright green and pink
[4877.15s -> 4879.15s]  and like orange and magenta
[4879.15s -> 4881.15s]  colors.
[4881.15s -> 4883.15s]  They're wacky.
[4883.15s -> 4885.15s]  I think that's why I like them.
[4885.15s -> 4887.15s]  They're wacky places.
[4887.15s -> 4890.80s]  There's a fountain with a lion.
[4890.80s -> 4892.80s]  You know, a lion statue.
[4892.80s -> 4895.87s]  Guys, there's a casino boat here that has
[4895.87s -> 4897.87s]  a fucking pirate ship in it.
[4897.87s -> 4900.36s]  It's bizarre.
[4900.36s -> 4902.36s]  Oh yeah, there's a big pirate ship here.
[4902.36s -> 4904.54s]  All right.
[4904.54s -> 4907.42s]  It's cool. It's just weird
[4907.42s -> 4917.92s]  and tacky. It adds
[4917.92s -> 4920.48s]  taste. Oh no, you said ADHD
[4920.48s -> 4922.48s]  taste. I thought you were
[4922.48s -> 4925.42s]  being nice. Okay.
[4925.42s -> 4927.42s]  So this is going to be a bathroom.
[4927.42s -> 4949.42s]  This room looks delicious.
[4949.42s -> 4951.42s]  I want to come in here and just breathe the
[4951.42s -> 4953.79s]  air in here without the toilets.
[4953.79s -> 4957.95s]  I'm just saying the empty room.
[4960.76s -> 4965.18s]  I mean,
[4965.18s -> 4967.18s]  I just mean this.
[4967.18s -> 4969.18s]  The way that it looks, I feel like it's clean
[4969.18s -> 4971.18s]  and crisp.
[4971.18s -> 4973.18s]  Forget about what goes in here after.
[4975.48s -> 4980.40s]  I'm doing it.
[4980.40s -> 4983.85s]  Are you high? No, I'm not.
[4983.85s -> 4985.85s]  Guys, I'm not high.
[4985.85s -> 4989.12s]  All right, that's the bathroom.
[4989.12s -> 4993.92s]  Dude, this is going to be sick.
[4993.92s -> 4996.16s]  I need like a staff room too.
[4996.16s -> 5001.00s]  All right, I can start putting stuff down.
[5001.00s -> 5004.27s]  So I want
[5004.27s -> 5007.40s]  table games here.
[5007.40s -> 5009.77s]  Baccarat. Sweet game.
[5009.77s -> 5011.95s]  Blackjack.
[5011.95s -> 5013.95s]  I don't really, you know, I don't like Blackjack
[5013.95s -> 5015.95s]  that much anymore. I love Blackjack
[5015.95s -> 5017.95s]  but you know what? The game kind of sucks, if I'm honest.
[5017.95s -> 5022.04s]  PyGal. That's the game.
[5022.04s -> 5024.99s]  Now that's the game.
[5024.99s -> 5026.99s]  This game, let me tell you something about PyGal.
[5026.99s -> 5030.00s]  Ludwig put me on to this game.
[5030.00s -> 5032.00s]  And you can sit there
[5032.00s -> 5034.00s]  all day and not lose any money.
[5034.00s -> 5036.00s]  Like, well, let me preface that
[5036.00s -> 5038.00s]  by saying something very important.
[5038.00s -> 5040.00s]  Yes, you will lose money. But like, it's the slowest
[5040.00s -> 5042.00s]  fucking game in the whole casino.
[5042.00s -> 5046.40s]  You can just sit there
[5046.40s -> 5048.40s]  and just do little
[5048.40s -> 5050.40s]  bets and it's so easy to
[5050.40s -> 5055.20s]  push on PyGal. Blackjack
[5055.20s -> 5057.20s]  is like, oh, you lose, oh, you lose,
[5057.20s -> 5059.20s]  you lose, you lose, you lose, you lose.
[5059.20s -> 5061.63s]  It takes like, it takes like fucking
[5061.63s -> 5063.63s]  a full two or three minutes to do a game with PyGal.
[5063.63s -> 5065.63s]  You just sit there.
[5065.63s -> 5067.63s]  You can do fucking small little bets. It doesn't even matter.
[5067.63s -> 5073.39s]  Don't play at the fucking casino though.
[5073.39s -> 5081.18s]  Is that fun?
[5081.18s -> 5083.18s]  Gambling is only fun
[5083.18s -> 5085.18s]  if you go in with a small amount of money.
[5085.18s -> 5087.18s]  A certain small amount of money that you
[5087.18s -> 5089.18s]  know you're never going to get back.
[5089.18s -> 5091.18s]  And it's a form of entertainment that you
[5091.18s -> 5093.18s]  do very rarely.
[5093.18s -> 5095.18s]  Every so often,
[5095.18s -> 5097.55s]  rarely, is how
[5097.55s -> 5100.24s]  I find fun with the game.
[5100.24s -> 5102.60s]  Rarely. I lived in Vegas,
[5102.60s -> 5104.60s]  right? I know how
[5104.60s -> 5106.60s]  fucked up it can be.
[5106.60s -> 5108.84s]  Trust me. But,
[5108.84s -> 5111.66s]  I would be dishonest if I told you
[5111.66s -> 5113.66s]  that I didn't enjoy playing the games.
[5113.66s -> 5116.03s]  Uh, maybe every
[5116.03s -> 5119.87s]  few months? But,
[5119.87s -> 5124.80s]  that's it. Rarely, it's a
[5124.80s -> 5127.55s]  what do you mean? I moved
[5127.55s -> 5130.88s]  there. Dude, fuck off,
[5130.88s -> 5132.88s]  we know you live in Wisconsin.
[5132.88s -> 5134.88s]  What if I was just lying about living here the whole time?
[5134.88s -> 5139.53s]  No,
[5139.53s -> 5142.41s]  but PyGal is slow.
[5142.41s -> 5144.41s]  The last couple times I played Blackjack,
[5144.41s -> 5146.65s]  it's just like, okay,
[5146.65s -> 5148.65s]  I just, the dealer hit 20,
[5148.65s -> 5150.65s]  dealer hit 21, dealer hit 19, dealer has
[5150.65s -> 5152.65s]  20. Okay, well, what the fuck?
[5152.65s -> 5159.05s]  It's been 10 minutes.
[5159.05s -> 5161.05s]  He lives in Wisconsin.
[5161.05s -> 5165.92s]  Yeah, gambling should only be
[5165.92s -> 5167.92s]  a form of entertainment, very occasionally.
[5167.92s -> 5169.92s]  That's how I feel about it.
[5169.92s -> 5172.86s]  That's truly how I feel about it.
[5172.86s -> 5175.55s]  But I do enjoy it.
[5175.55s -> 5177.55s]  Go out with friends, sit around a table,
[5177.55s -> 5180.94s]  and just hang out. They got casinos
[5180.94s -> 5182.94s]  in Wisconsin!
[5182.94s -> 5184.94s]  Do they actually, do they? I actually have no idea.
[5184.94s -> 5189.16s]  You just seem bad.
[5189.16s -> 5191.16s]  You guys, you can't be bad at a casino
[5191.16s -> 5193.16s]  game. That's the thing you have to be, you want to
[5193.16s -> 5195.16s]  talk about fucking what you need to get out of your
[5195.16s -> 5197.16s]  head? You cannot be good
[5197.16s -> 5199.16s]  at a casino game.
[5199.16s -> 5201.16s]  There is no being good at a casino
[5201.16s -> 5203.92s]  game, unless it's poker.
[5203.92s -> 5205.92s]  Poker? Yes, you've, yes,
[5205.92s -> 5207.92s]  there is some, there's a lot going on there.
[5207.92s -> 5209.92s]  Poker, and some of those poker-oriented
[5209.92s -> 5213.76s]  games are. Everything else at the casino
[5213.76s -> 5215.93s]  is just throw a million
[5215.93s -> 5221.95s]  dice in the air and did you win. There's people that go
[5221.95s -> 5223.95s]  and they sit down at a slot machine and they go, no, no, no,
[5223.95s -> 5225.95s]  I know the secret. There is no secret.
[5225.95s -> 5228.19s]  The secret is the gigantic math problem that's playing
[5228.19s -> 5230.19s]  behind the reels.
[5230.19s -> 5233.56s]  That's it. Even Blackjack. Blackjack
[5233.56s -> 5235.56s]  has a low house edge, but it's just
[5235.56s -> 5238.44s]  random on, I mean, unless
[5238.44s -> 5240.44s]  you're like counting cards, which you can't do,
[5240.44s -> 5242.88s]  and a lot of these casinos
[5242.88s -> 5244.88s]  make sure you're not doing that. They have
[5244.88s -> 5246.88s]  like 8 plus 10 plus
[5246.88s -> 5251.61s]  deck games, so
[5251.61s -> 5255.90s]  it's not, that's not gonna happen. It's
[5255.90s -> 5259.93s]  illegal. You can't, it's not illegal.
[5259.93s -> 5267.08s]  What? But anyways, like roulette
[5267.08s -> 5269.08s]  too, like there is no like, no, no, no, no, no, I
[5269.08s -> 5271.52s]  know the number it's gonna be. No, you don't
[5271.52s -> 5273.52s]  know the number. Man, you just don't. You don't.
[5273.52s -> 5275.52s]  It's literally a ball that spins around in a
[5275.52s -> 5278.01s]  circle and lands on a
[5278.01s -> 5281.02s]  random slot. You might get lucky,
[5281.02s -> 5283.02s]  yeah, and when you do, nice.
[5283.02s -> 5285.77s]  It's fucking fun. That's it.
[5285.77s -> 5295.04s]  How come I can't unlock these? I need
[5295.04s -> 5297.04s]  to research ultimate house advantage.
[5297.04s -> 5299.85s]  Oh, I need a cashier cage.
[5299.85s -> 5302.35s]  Okay, I need a cashier cage. Let's put that in
[5302.35s -> 5311.31s]  here. But I'm not, I'm not gonna hear
[5311.31s -> 5314.19s]  this thing. I'm not gonna sit here and tell you
[5314.19s -> 5316.56s]  that what you shouldn't do
[5316.56s -> 5318.56s]  with your money, right? But I'm gonna tell you
[5318.56s -> 5320.56s]  to be careful with your money. That's it.
[5320.56s -> 5325.66s]  Be fucking careful. It's really
[5325.66s -> 5327.66s]  easy to get caught up in this shit. Just be fucking
[5327.66s -> 5330.99s]  careful. Genuinely is.
[5330.99s -> 5337.24s]  How come this is not flush?
[5337.24s -> 5347.68s]  Why is this not flush? I want this to be
[5347.68s -> 5349.98s]  flush with the wall. What the hell?
[5349.98s -> 5356.19s]  It can't be flush? Oh, there needs to be
[5356.19s -> 5358.19s]  a way for the cashier to get in.
[5358.19s -> 5361.84s]  Oh, they're gonna be stuck.
[5361.84s -> 5365.55s]  I'm sitting here going, why can't I make this
[5365.55s -> 5367.55s]  flush against the wall? Cause they would never be
[5367.55s -> 5370.24s]  able to leave. Okay,
[5370.24s -> 5383.42s]  I get it. I'll have to.
[5383.42s -> 5387.64s]  Somebody said, what do I feel about pineapple
[5387.64s -> 5389.64s]  vodka? That's a great drink.
[5389.64s -> 5391.64s]  That's a fantastic
[5391.64s -> 5393.88s]  beverage. I would recommend if you
[5393.88s -> 5395.88s]  are of the age to drink alcohol and
[5395.88s -> 5398.43s]  responsibly can drink.
[5398.43s -> 5400.80s]  It's a drink to drink. It's just simple.
[5400.80s -> 5403.04s]  There's no bullshit.
[5403.04s -> 5408.28s]  Not a bunch of nonsense. That's another thing.
[5408.28s -> 5410.28s]  Guys, I only drink like
[5410.28s -> 5412.28s]  five times, six times a year too.
[5412.28s -> 5416.44s]  As our most celebrated, most
[5416.44s -> 5419.07s]  intelligent scholar, Ben Franklin
[5419.07s -> 5422.01s]  said, all things in moderation.
[5422.01s -> 5424.01s]  Ben Franklin was the smartest person in the world. That's why he's on the hundred.
[5424.01s -> 5426.38s]  Ben's not on the one.
[5426.38s -> 5428.38s]  Ben's not on the five. Ben's on
[5428.38s -> 5430.38s]  the one hundred
[5430.38s -> 5432.75s]  dollar bill. Why do you think that is?
[5432.75s -> 5434.75s]  Why do you think Ben Franklin's on the one hundred?
[5434.75s -> 5443.64s]  He's one hundred!
[5443.64s -> 5452.41s]  Is that the guy from Jerma Rumble?
[5452.41s -> 5455.87s]  You know, there's a five hundred and a one thousand.
[5455.87s -> 5465.08s]  Yeah, okay.
[5465.08s -> 5475.71s]  What's the one thousand? There's no
[5475.71s -> 5491.96s]  one thousand note? There's no
[5491.96s -> 5493.96s]  thousand dollar denomination. Wait,
[5493.96s -> 5500.17s]  one thousand dollar bill.
[5500.17s -> 5504.91s]  Like its smaller cousin,
[5504.91s -> 5506.91s]  one thousand dollar bill was discontinued in
[5506.91s -> 5509.15s]  1969. Who was on it?
[5509.15s -> 5515.23s]  Grover Cleveland was on
[5515.23s -> 5517.23s]  the one thousand dollar bill?
[5517.23s -> 5519.79s]  And William McKinley was on
[5519.79s -> 5521.79s]  the five hundred dollar bill. They're not
[5521.79s -> 5524.80s]  in circulation anymore. Wait,
[5524.80s -> 5526.80s]  Grover Cleveland was on the one thousand?
[5526.80s -> 5534.28s]  What the hell? It existed,
[5534.28s -> 5537.55s]  but doesn't exist anymore. All right, let's
[5537.55s -> 5539.55s]  get a couple of roulette tables. Oh, we need
[5539.55s -> 5556.00s]  ATMs. ATM Andy.
[5556.00s -> 5560.92s]  But yeah, you're gonna,
[5560.92s -> 5562.92s]  when you go into the casino, that money you bring in
[5562.92s -> 5564.92s]  is, you need to go in with the mindset
[5564.92s -> 5566.92s]  of, this is already
[5566.92s -> 5568.92s]  gone. It's gone. Treat it
[5568.92s -> 5570.92s]  like it's already gone. And that's it.
[5570.92s -> 5573.93s]  Don't do anything else. You
[5573.93s -> 5576.11s]  are going to lose it. You might win
[5576.11s -> 5578.11s]  and it's, well cool, you did it. Hooray!
[5578.11s -> 5580.99s]  Treat it like it's gone and that's it and have
[5580.99s -> 5582.99s]  a good time with your friends. If you ever go to the, and
[5582.99s -> 5584.99s]  this is not, obviously I'm not trying to endorse a casino.
[5584.99s -> 5587.48s]  I'm just saying, that's how you should do
[5587.48s -> 5589.48s]  it. Don't do it any other fucking way.
[5589.48s -> 5591.79s]  I'm telling you, please listen to me.
[5591.79s -> 5595.95s]  If you're ever at a casino and you bring
[5595.95s -> 5597.95s]  whatever you're going to bring
[5597.95s -> 5599.95s]  for the night or for the weekend or for the week,
[5599.95s -> 5602.57s]  that's it. And it's gone.
[5602.57s -> 5605.20s]  Don't, do not
[5605.20s -> 5607.20s]  take that extra step to be like,
[5607.20s -> 5609.20s]  all right, I kind of blew through that.
[5609.20s -> 5611.20s]  I'm gonna go to the ATM
[5611.20s -> 5613.20s]  again. No, don't do it. Don't do it.
[5613.20s -> 5615.76s]  Don't. Don't do it.
[5615.76s -> 5617.76s]  Don't. Listen to me. Are you listening?
[5617.76s -> 5621.92s]  Don't. Do that.
[5621.92s -> 5623.92s]  I want you to think of me saying that, if you ever do that.
[5623.92s -> 5628.91s]  And just, and then if you're, you know, if you're over 21,
[5628.91s -> 5631.98s]  go get yourself a box of pineapple, you know?
[5631.98s -> 5634.54s]  And just sip on it. Just fucking walk around
[5634.54s -> 5638.49s]  and la la. Okay.
[5638.49s -> 5642.84s]  Texas Hold'em, that should be another room
[5642.84s -> 5650.97s]  for Texas Hold'em, right? I'll do what I want
[5650.97s -> 5653.66s]  with my money. And you are completely,
[5653.66s -> 5656.16s]  that's, yeah, that's up to you. Just
[5656.16s -> 5658.16s]  be fucking careful. Ben Franklin,
[5658.16s -> 5660.16s]  Ben Franklin's gonna like turn into
[5660.16s -> 5662.16s]  like a force ghost. He's gonna be in
[5662.16s -> 5664.52s]  front of you. He's gonna have a cigar in his mouth.
[5664.52s -> 5667.90s]  He's gonna have, he's gonna have,
[5667.90s -> 5669.90s]  he's gonna have like a fucking invention in one hand.
[5669.90s -> 5672.96s]  And like in his other hand, it's gonna be
[5672.96s -> 5674.96s]  a, I don't know,
[5674.96s -> 5677.20s]  I almost said chainsaw. He's gonna
[5677.20s -> 5679.20s]  just show up. He's gonna just have like a, he's gonna have a
[5679.20s -> 5681.20s]  kite in one hand. And
[5681.20s -> 5683.20s]  a chainsaw in the other hand.
[5683.20s -> 5685.37s]  And just, he force ghosts in front
[5685.37s -> 5687.37s]  of you. And I don't know what Ben Franklin
[5687.37s -> 5689.37s]  sounded like, but I imagine it was something like this.
[5689.37s -> 5692.19s]  What you should do
[5692.19s -> 5694.19s]  is absolutely not
[5694.19s -> 5696.19s]  find your way back to the ATM.
[5696.19s -> 5699.37s]  Turn around.
[5699.37s -> 5701.37s]  All things in moderation, my friend.
[5701.37s -> 5703.61s]  Leave the casino.
[5703.61s -> 5705.85s]  And go with your friends somewhere else.
[5705.85s -> 5710.65s]  And then if he just
[5710.65s -> 5712.65s]  grrrank valued
[5712.65s -> 5715.08s]  grrrank valued
[5715.08s -> 5720.35s]  hhaaaany in the
[5720.35s -> 5726.80s]  d, he's cut he's cut like a bush.
[5726.80s -> 5728.80s]  John Oliver. What if you're on a winning streak?
[5728.80s -> 5730.80s]  If you're on a winning streak then the Ben Franklin
[5730.80s -> 5732.80s]  goes boom! Poops up.

[6541.02s -> 6547.05s]  the shit where you're sitting on the toilet and the toilet paper is essentially almost touching
[6547.05s -> 6557.26s]  your leg and the sink is touching your elbow and the no give me some room give me some room i need
[6557.26s -> 6574.38s]  room i've cursed out loud when i open up the door to the bathroom i see that the sink is within
[6574.38s -> 6580.64s]  elbows reach of the toilet and it's a bit like wood it's like a box and you can literally just
[6580.64s -> 6584.08s]  sit and squeeze in there until i don't know why people like what and some of these hotels are
[6584.08s -> 6590.35s]  like fucking hundreds of dollars a night you know what i mean can i i'm gonna go off here

[6599.21s -> 6605.50s]  with this but i don't think i will hotels that are like kind of old and that's the point where it's
[6605.50s -> 6610.46s]  like oh yeah the room is like fucking old and the bathroom is old and the plumbing is old and the
[6610.46s -> 6618.41s]  whole thing is fucking old well that'll be that'll be three or four hundred dollars a night i i i want

[6627.15s -> 6631.47s]  and they have to sit there and wait for the water to get like 20 minutes 20 minutes with water get
[6631.47s -> 6638.12s]  hot you know what i mean that's an overstatement but you know what i mean it's like just old for
[6638.12s -> 6651.10s]  the sake of being old and they cost more than just staying at like a regular ass hotel i just get all
[6651.10s -> 6661.52s]  this is all i want i want a clean room small with just a bed a functioning television and a clean
[6661.52s -> 6667.56s]  bathroom and the plumbing works and it's not like oh well you know this uh this place has been here

[8945.32s -> 8950.94s]  this me and my family were on vacation one time this is a long time ago this and we were like
[8950.94s -> 8959.95s]  little kids i was probably i don't know i want to say maybe 10 and we we like rented out this
[8959.95s -> 8964.27s]  cabin or something and we were on like a big vacation to go out and like the go camping and
[8964.27s -> 8970.96s]  shit and they had these this big bedroom that was upstairs it was like this kind of big loft
[8972.06s -> 8979.36s]  and the ceiling was kind of slanted down and uh our beds were kind of up against the walls
[8980.54s -> 8988.01s]  so because the way the ceilings were slanted when you when you were lying in the bed your head
[8988.97s -> 8995.45s]  it was kind of the ceiling kind of went diagonal over your head in a way and i'm trying to think
[8995.45s -> 9002.06s]  like exactly how the architecture was but my brother woke up in the morning
[9003.44s -> 9008.48s]  and he like just got right out of bed in the morning and just smashed his head against like
[9008.48s -> 9015.53s]  the ceiling it was the way that like the ceiling was angled i'm trying to forget how it happened
[9016.25s -> 9023.77s]  but he just woke up and was like oh yay it just it was so excited to be to get out of bed and
[9023.77s -> 9030.88s]  just smash his head against the ceiling i don't know if they were like wooden frames or something
[9033.53s -> 9035.93s]  i've done that before clown family
[9051.18s -> 9060.68s]  this stuck with me for a decade a decade two decades three decades i we were we were at the
[9060.68s -> 9067.55s]  mall one time and we were walking around and there was this you know in the mall how there's those

[9074.40s -> 9077.76s]  a big screen right and it's like there's an ad on this side or something on this side something
[9077.76s -> 9086.20s]  on this side i i don't know why there was a goldie hawn movie that we were walking me my brother
[9086.20s -> 9092.67s]  and like my family was in the mall and my brother for some reason thought thought that this goldie

[16795.69s -> 16805.69s]  a five percent chance to win ten grand you would bring camping equipment and sit here and you would
[16805.69s -> 16822.43s]  pack fucking ten sandwiches you wouldn't leave five percent odds yeah see this person's smart
[16822.43s -> 16838.76s]  they came with 295 dollars no what are you leaving that wait a minute that lady sat down
[16838.76s -> 16868.00s]  with 295 lost three or four spins and then left pissed one cent all you would have to do is hit
[16868.00s -> 16879.12s]  this one time and you would never lose ever you just need to hit this once it's a five percent
[16879.12s -> 16892.00s]  chance to win ten grand at one cent bet how is nobody hitting it i'm not crazy right this
[16892.00s -> 16910.59s]  costs one cent oh that's still pretty damn good oh the max prize is is a hundred dollars oh never
