[0.31s -> 12.82s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Welcome back to more Hitman Absolution.
[12.82s -> 17.82s]  This is going to be the second part of the Terminus mission, the Upper Floors.
[17.82s -> 19.82s]  So let's go. Welcome back.
[25.26s -> 29.26s]  Yeah, well, I pretty much just killed, like, everybody downstairs.
[29.26s -> 31.26s]  There was a lot of people that didn't die.
[31.26s -> 33.26s]  Uh-huh. Seal up tight.
[35.43s -> 39.43s]  Come on! I didn't do anything. I wanted to hear what they were saying.
[39.43s -> 43.43s]  You know what, buddy? I'm going to restart this mission, but just because you are a jerk,
[43.43s -> 49.43s]  I'm going to blow your faces off! All three of you! Yeah!
[49.43s -> 55.18s]  Alright, so I guess how it works is if you are disguised as a group of people,
[55.18s -> 60.18s]  they will see through your disguise. That group will see through your disguise more often than not.
[60.18s -> 64.18s]  So you can't just, like, walk into groups of people that I'm disguised as.
[65.18s -> 68.49s]  I know. Too bad. That's too bad.
[72.62s -> 77.63s]  I don't know where to go. There's people everywhere here, man. Where am I supposed to go?
[80.15s -> 84.71s]  Let's follow this lady. Maybe not, because she's in, like, somebody's room.
[86.40s -> 91.93s]  Point of interest. Over here. Alright.
[94.00s -> 96.00s]  A lot of paintings on the wall.
[96.00s -> 100.18s]  I thought there was blood all over the ground here. It's flowers.
[100.18s -> 104.18s]  I thought somebody got, like, riddled with bullets in this hallway for a second.
[104.18s -> 107.63s]  Indicates a nearby fire escape.
[107.63s -> 109.94s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[109.94s -> 113.80s]  There's nobody even here. What? Who am I hiding from?
[113.80s -> 117.23s]  Was I not supposed to come in this room? I probably wasn't, like, allowed in here,
[117.23s -> 119.23s]  because, I mean, it did say do not disturb, so.
[119.23s -> 123.92s]  This lady's like, uh, sir, what the hell are you doing over there?
[123.92s -> 128.36s]  Nothing, I'm just standing here. Hi.
[128.36s -> 131.36s]  Alright, let me, will you get out of the way, bitch?
[131.36s -> 134.54s]  I didn't mean to call you bitch, but you're just getting on my nerves. Alright.
[134.54s -> 136.03s]  What is this?
[136.03s -> 141.10s]  The musician won't leave his room without a reason, so this guy apparently...
[141.10s -> 143.10s]  Is anybody even in here?
[143.10s -> 144.10s]  Oh, he's right there.
[144.10s -> 147.86s]  Is he just in there rocking out, playing the guitar?
[147.86s -> 153.56s]  Well, sorry, dude. I'm ruining your stuff.
[153.56s -> 157.82s]  Can I go, I can't go out this window. Can I just, like, crouch back here?
[157.82s -> 162.77s]  No, no, get in this thing! Get in here! Quick! Get in!
[162.77s -> 168.66s]  Alright, is he coming out? Yeah, he is.
[168.66s -> 172.66s]  Oh, your room is crazy, man. I can't wait to go in there and break those lights.
[172.66s -> 179.96s]  Uh, you're gonna have to turn around, so...
[179.96s -> 181.96s]  If I come at it, he's gonna see me!
[181.96s -> 186.80s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, make your way to that speaker. Go fix it.
[186.80s -> 189.17s]  There's a problem there. You're gonna have to deal with it.
[189.17s -> 197.49s]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. He doesn't know I was here. Oh, boy.
[197.49s -> 201.26s]  He's still fixing his stuff. What am I doing here?
[201.26s -> 204.21s]  What the hell am I supposed to do in here? There's a bottle.
[204.21s -> 210.29s]  Uh, sure. This room is gonna make me, like, start to hallucinate.
[210.29s -> 214.83s]  Oh, he's back. He's back! He's back!
[214.83s -> 218.10s]  What am I doing here?
[218.10s -> 220.10s]  I like, I broke in this guy's room for, like, no reason.
[220.10s -> 226.18s]  Wait a minute. Um, I think I'm gonna have to bottle this guy in the face.
[226.18s -> 228.48s]  That's really my only solution.
[228.48s -> 232.85s]  Because I don't know what to do, but I'm gonna hide his body. Don't worry.
[232.85s -> 237.89s]  Oh, that didn't even work! Come here!
[237.89s -> 241.34s]  Alright, we're good. We're good.
[241.34s -> 246.49s]  Okay, I'm good. Nobody heard that. Nobody saw that.
[247.98s -> 249.98s]  Now I can, can I take his disguise? I cannot.
[249.98s -> 255.70s]  Can I play his keyboard? Let's hope so.
[255.70s -> 260.74s]  Dump his body in here.
[260.74s -> 262.74s]  I can't believe the bottle. I didn't, like, hurt him.
[262.74s -> 267.18s]  I threw a bottle at this guy's face and it, like, didn't do anything.
[267.18s -> 269.18s]  I should probably put the shotgun away. That would be a bad idea.
[269.18s -> 273.98s]  Pizza? I'll take a slice.
[273.98s -> 278.71s]  So what was the purpose of this room?
[278.71s -> 280.71s]  This son of a bitch had nothing in here for me to do.
[280.71s -> 284.40s]  There's gotta be something in here. Why would, why would I be coming in here?
[284.40s -> 288.99s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[288.99s -> 292.58s]  Mmm, whoa. This is, no, this is the same...
[292.58s -> 298.42s]  Can I go with the window? Is there any, oh, there's a window.
[298.42s -> 302.86s]  Fire extinguisher? Nah, I don't think I want that.
[302.86s -> 305.86s]  This guy's got food literally everywhere. What a freak.
[305.86s -> 313.00s]  I don't know. Let's go.
[313.00s -> 316.69s]  So maybe I had to come through there? Ooh, can I go, oh!
[316.69s -> 324.18s]  I can, like, go up here, can't I? That's where the guy is. That's where, like, the target is.
[324.18s -> 330.15s]  Climb. If this, there's not some guy just standing right here, is there?
[330.15s -> 336.85s]  Oh lord. Progress is only saved to, oh yeah, definitely activate the checkpoint.
[336.85s -> 341.75s]  Minus one thirty five oh, god damn it.
[341.75s -> 345.95s]  Well, what's, whoa, whoa, see ya!
[345.95s -> 349.32s]  Oh my, oh my!
[349.32s -> 353.84s]  That's a long, oh, he just broke his back! Wow!
[353.84s -> 359.37s]  Well, why do I always do that to people?
[359.37s -> 361.37s]  I always do that to people!
[361.37s -> 366.62s]  I probably could've just let that guy, like, smoke his cigarette or whatever he was doing and he could leave.
[366.62s -> 371.69s]  You think this guy's gonna be suspicious that his, like, best friend just is not here anymore?
[371.69s -> 375.02s]  Maybe I can pull this guy out too. Do I have anything?
[375.02s -> 378.38s]  No, I don't, can I make any noise? No, I don't think so.
[378.38s -> 381.95s]  Uh, only one guy in here.
[381.95s -> 387.24s]  Will you get out of the way? I don't, this guy's gonna see me walk by, go.
[387.24s -> 395.48s]  Okay, I need a new disguise, man. I can't just be, like, walking around.
[395.48s -> 401.33s]  Maybe these guys will have a conversation. Maybe not.
[401.33s -> 404.70s]  I have to, there's really no other way unless I go down.
[404.70s -> 410.41s]  I don't really wanna go down. This is gonna take a little bit of thought, hold on.
[410.41s -> 416.70s]  Uh, I can go in here, but these guys are in there.
[416.70s -> 423.09s]  Come to the window. Come over to the window and take a look.
[423.09s -> 426.09s]  You're gonna meet the same fate as your friend.
[427.09s -> 430.29s]  No, this guy's still just staring at me.
[430.29s -> 438.23s]  Damn it! Wait, is that the target right there?
[438.23s -> 440.47s]  Um, I guess I can drop down.
[440.47s -> 446.04s]  But then again, I wanna be, like, up on this top floor, don't I?
[446.04s -> 453.54s]  We'll see. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[453.54s -> 456.74s]  I might be able to get behind this guy right now.
[456.74s -> 460.32s]  No, there's another guard in here. Damn it!
[460.32s -> 467.19s]  Let's go down. Looks like I can get in this way.
[467.19s -> 472.59s]  Hop down again, maybe? No, that's it.
[472.59s -> 478.07s]  I can either go up, I have to go in this door, or this window.
[478.07s -> 480.98s]  Damn it, man.
[480.98s -> 485.30s]  Now that these guys are all the way to the back, I'm gonna try and distract them.
[485.30s -> 488.12s]  I got an idea. I got an idea.
[488.12s -> 491.70s]  At least, oh, you know what, I can just try and do some crazy stuff right now
[491.70s -> 493.70s]  because I do have that checkpoint right there.
[493.70s -> 497.02s]  So, let's just go in.
[497.02s -> 500.02s]  When this guy turns around again, I'm going in this window.
[500.02s -> 505.25s]  Turn around, come on. Turn around.
[505.25s -> 509.90s]  I'm gonna ask you nicely one more time, and then I'm pulling out the gun.
[509.90s -> 513.67s]  And I'm gonna shoot you in your face.
[513.67s -> 519.95s]  Turn around. Turn around! Turn around, there we go!
[519.95s -> 524.30s]  Turn around, that's what I like to see.
[524.30s -> 527.61s]  Okay, I have reached the eighth floor.
[527.61s -> 537.35s]  My word, this is gonna take a lot of, like, good, like, stealth.
[537.35s -> 539.35s]  Oh, the piano. I can knock the piano thing down?
[539.35s -> 543.92s]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy.
[543.92s -> 547.34s]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
[547.34s -> 550.41s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, don't come over here.
[550.41s -> 554.12s]  Do not come over here.
[554.12s -> 558.32s]  This is the most nerve-wracking thing ever.
[558.32s -> 560.69s]  So, if I knock down that piano pin, is there a place for me to hide?
[560.69s -> 565.10s]  Can I hide in the fireplace? Hmm.
[565.10s -> 567.79s]  I know what I'm gonna do.
[567.79s -> 570.29s]  I'm gonna grab the bottle, I'm gonna throw the bottle over there,
[570.29s -> 574.83s]  and I'm gonna try and make my way silently out the left side.
[574.83s -> 575.83s]  There's only one guy there.
[575.83s -> 583.34s]  Let me go bottle, and throw it over there, and wait for them to freak out.
[583.34s -> 590.01s]  Yeah, yeah, go! Whoa, right there!
[590.01s -> 591.01s]  There's a guy right there!
[591.01s -> 593.14s]  Knock this down.
[593.14s -> 598.98s]  Oh, no, now that's all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them.
[598.98s -> 601.82s]  Am I actually gonna get away with this?
[601.82s -> 603.82s]  How the hell did I not get spotted right there?
[603.82s -> 604.82s]  Are you kidding me?
[604.82s -> 607.73s]  I need that bottle.
[607.73s -> 612.31s]  Oh, I need to just go in the room behind me, but I can't.
[612.31s -> 614.31s]  I'm gonna alert this whole entire upper floor.
[614.31s -> 619.30s]  Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[619.30s -> 624.83s]  Are you? Come here.
[624.83s -> 625.83s]  Come here, you!
[625.83s -> 627.33s]  Come here, you son of a bitch!
[627.33s -> 630.38s]  Quiet! Just be quiet! Shut up!
[631.88s -> 635.25s]  What do I go? What do I go?
[635.25s -> 636.25s]  Is there anybody in this hall?
[636.25s -> 638.42s]  Come on, come this way, this way, this way, this way, come on.
[638.42s -> 639.42s]  Give me your disguise.
[639.42s -> 644.10s]  No, get up, get up.
[644.10s -> 645.53s]  Get up, get in here.
[645.53s -> 648.54s]  There's so many people on this top floor.
[648.54s -> 651.74s]  Oh, I got up to 12,000 points, guys.
[651.74s -> 653.74s]  Doing things correct.
[653.74s -> 654.74s]  What do you know?
[654.74s -> 656.30s]  Doing things correctly.
[656.30s -> 659.11s]  Now where on earth am I going?
[659.11s -> 662.02s]  Okay, don't want to go that way.
[662.02s -> 665.41s]  Did I just, is this the exit? Did I do this?
[665.41s -> 668.82s]  Pick lock?
[668.82s -> 671.64s]  Ooh, I'm picking the lock.
[671.64s -> 674.29s]  This is where I gotta go.
[674.29s -> 675.29s]  I think I just did it.
[675.29s -> 677.49s]  I just did it!
[677.49s -> 678.49s]  No, I didn't.
[678.49s -> 681.20s]  No, I didn't.
[681.20s -> 683.34s]  Not quite.
[683.34s -> 685.22s]  This is the room, though.
[685.22s -> 689.27s]  Is this something I gotta do?
[689.27s -> 690.27s]  What's that?
[690.27s -> 691.27s]  A direct approach is not an option.
[691.27s -> 692.27s]  I need an alternate point of entry.
[692.27s -> 693.27s]  All right, well, here we go.
[693.27s -> 697.67s]  I'll come in like a spider.
[697.67s -> 698.67s]  I'll snatch you up.
[705.11s -> 707.11s]  She's worth a lot of money.
[711.55s -> 713.55s]  So that's the target.
[714.55s -> 715.92s]  All right.
[715.92s -> 718.50s]  Come at me, bro.
[718.50s -> 719.50s]  What's going on?
[719.50s -> 720.50s]  I don't like drugs.
[720.50s -> 721.50s]  What's going on?
[721.50s -> 722.50s]  I'm on like drugs right now.
[722.50s -> 726.62s]  What's happening?
[726.62s -> 728.95s]  I think it's...
[728.95s -> 729.95s]  What's...
[729.95s -> 731.45s]  I did it.
[731.45s -> 732.45s]  Nice.
[732.45s -> 734.58s]  All right.
[734.58s -> 735.58s]  I unlocked some things, too.
[735.58s -> 736.58s]  Hey, that's not bad.
[736.58s -> 738.58s]  That's not bad.
[738.58s -> 741.58s]  I'll take a minus 5,000 points.
[741.58s -> 745.19s]  But I got 12,000 for the first part.
[745.19s -> 746.19s]  Oh, the second part.
[746.19s -> 748.25s]  Let's take a look.
[748.25s -> 749.25s]  Nine to...
[749.25s -> 750.25s]  Oh!
[750.25s -> 755.79s]  I killed 11 people downstairs.
[755.79s -> 758.48s]  Well, that could have been like a good score
[758.48s -> 760.48s]  if I didn't murder 11 people.
[760.48s -> 762.42s]  All right, let's keep going here.
[762.42s -> 766.01s]  Hey, how are you?
[766.01s -> 767.82s]  That's a big dude.
[767.82s -> 769.82s]  Oh, you're getting choked out, baby.
[771.51s -> 772.51s]  That didn't work.
[775.07s -> 777.07s]  No, because I'm Hitman, baby.
[777.07s -> 779.27s]  What?
[782.39s -> 783.76s]  Are you kidding me?
[783.76s -> 785.70s]  I look pale.
[788.70s -> 790.70s]  No, he's a goddamn Hitman.
[790.70s -> 792.70s]  He's a goddamn Hitman.
[794.70s -> 801.70s]  That's a Hitman.
[801.70s -> 802.70s]  That's a Hitman.
[803.70s -> 809.34s]  Everyone's got such a naughty, vulgar mouth.
[812.34s -> 818.22s]  Listen to all these, like, swears.
[822.26s -> 826.10s]  That guy's like nine feet tall.
[833.22s -> 835.46s]  This guy is a creep.
[836.46s -> 837.46s]  Look at this guy's face.
[838.46s -> 840.46s]  This guy is a creep.
[842.15s -> 844.97s]  Oh, boy.
[847.59s -> 848.59s]  That's not good.
[850.59s -> 858.78s]  All right, so this guy's like framing me for this murder
[858.78s -> 860.78s]  that I just did, apparently.
[860.78s -> 863.86s]  Now he's going to torch the place?
[863.86s -> 867.70s]  Oh, what a son of a bitch.
[867.70s -> 877.34s]  Well, that's one way to go about getting yourself framed.
[878.34s -> 879.77s]  I didn't do it, I swear.
[880.77s -> 881.94s]  Please don't kill me.
[892.98s -> 894.86s]  Whoa.
[897.70s -> 898.70s]  Run for your life.
[898.70s -> 901.32s]  All right, let's run for our lives.
[903.14s -> 905.14s]  So the guy that I just went to kill
[905.14s -> 908.14s]  torched the room and framed me.
[908.14s -> 910.14s]  He killed some maid over here.
[910.14s -> 912.14s]  And now these police think that I did it.
[913.38s -> 914.38s]  Welcome to Escape the Hotel.
[914.38s -> 915.38s]  Here we go.
[917.26s -> 918.26s]  I have no idea where on earth I'm going.
[918.26s -> 919.26s]  Let's go this way.
[920.26s -> 921.88s]  Fire, fire.
[921.88s -> 923.88s]  Somebody put out your fire.
[925.50s -> 926.50s]  Through here.
[926.50s -> 927.50s]  Of course.
[927.50s -> 929.96s]  At least I got the knife.
[931.26s -> 932.26s]  Wow.
[934.40s -> 935.83s]  Can only go one way.
[937.65s -> 938.65s]  They got a helicopter on me?
[939.82s -> 940.82s]  What is America's most wanted?
[942.13s -> 943.13s]  My god, stop it.
[943.13s -> 944.13s]  Leave me alone.
[944.13s -> 947.54s]  I got to climb up.
[950.70s -> 951.70s]  So wait, wait, wait.
[951.70s -> 954.70s]  You're telling me that from that like little bottle of whiskey
[954.70s -> 955.70s]  that that guy was...
[955.70s -> 957.70s]  Oh, wow.
[958.70s -> 959.70s]  Am I going to get hit by that?
[960.70s -> 964.29s]  You're trying to tell me what I was saying was
[964.29s -> 966.29s]  the little thing of whiskey that that guy poured on the ground.
[967.29s -> 972.29s]  You're telling me lit the hole, engulfed this entire hotel in flames.
[973.29s -> 974.29s]  Are you kidding me?
[975.29s -> 977.29s]  That's pretty ridiculous.
[978.29s -> 979.29s]  Whoa.
[979.29s -> 980.29s]  Wow.
[980.29s -> 981.29s]  Wait, that's a guy right there.
[981.29s -> 982.29s]  How are they on the roof already?
[987.75s -> 988.75s]  Can they?
[988.75s -> 989.75s]  It's like they can't see the smoke.
[991.50s -> 992.50s]  All right, so see through the smoke.
[992.50s -> 993.50s]  Go, go, go.
[993.50s -> 994.50s]  You can't see me.
[994.50s -> 996.58s]  You can't see me.
[996.58s -> 997.58s]  I'm good.
[999.84s -> 1000.84s]  Can I hop over?
[1002.21s -> 1003.21s]  I can't even hop over this way, can I?
[1004.21s -> 1005.96s]  Get me over here.
[1005.96s -> 1008.42s]  Damn it.
[1008.42s -> 1009.42s]  It's all right.
[1009.42s -> 1010.42s]  They can't see.
[1010.42s -> 1013.77s]  They can't see anything right now.
[1014.77s -> 1016.46s]  What's that?
[1016.46s -> 1017.95s]  I'll take the wrench.
[1020.34s -> 1022.34s]  Can I hop over this is the question at hand?
[1022.34s -> 1023.52s]  Nope.
[1023.52s -> 1024.52s]  I'll wait for them to go down.
[1026.91s -> 1027.91s]  Come on, get out of the way.
[1027.91s -> 1029.98s]  Oh, I got an idea.
[1029.98s -> 1031.16s]  Go get it, officers.
[1031.16s -> 1032.16s]  There's a wrench over there.
[1035.06s -> 1036.06s]  Only one of you is going to go over there and do that?
[1038.71s -> 1039.71s]  No, wait, that guy's going over here.
[1040.71s -> 1041.71s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[1041.71s -> 1042.71s]  Hurry up and go look at the wrench.
[1043.71s -> 1044.71s]  Do you have to like phone it in where you're going?
[1046.21s -> 1047.21s]  Go, go, go.
[1047.21s -> 1052.35s]  Good.
[1052.35s -> 1056.58s]  Sneak through the pipes here.
[1056.58s -> 1060.06s]  Hey, look at that.
[1060.06s -> 1061.06s]  Beautiful.
[1061.06s -> 1062.36s]  Get me the hell out of here.
[1063.79s -> 1064.79s]  There's the exit.
[1064.79s -> 1065.79s]  There's the exit.
[1065.79s -> 1066.79s]  There's the exit.
[1066.79s -> 1068.03s]  Break the door down.
[1069.03s -> 1071.91s]  The question is, did I make it?
[1071.91s -> 1072.91s]  Probably.
[1072.91s -> 1075.56s]  Whoa.
[1075.56s -> 1080.36s]  That's a pretty dramatic entrance.
[1080.36s -> 1085.29s]  Chicago's finest.
[1085.29s -> 1086.66s]  Where's he at, boys?
[1087.66s -> 1093.14s]  And that's going to wrap it up for this episode, ladies and gentlemen.
[1093.14s -> 1098.14s]  I will see you guys all for the next part where I try to escape from the Chicago Police Department.
[1099.14s -> 1100.14s]  But yeah, that'll be pretty soon here, guys.
[1100.14s -> 1102.14s]  So thanks so much for watching.
[1102.14s -> 1103.14s]  I really do appreciate it.
[1103.14s -> 1105.14s]  And take care, everybody.
