[2219.04s -> 2220.96s]  No worries. I don't know what's going on
[2220.96s -> 2225.84s]  But I think from trying to stream my perspective like i'm buffering my stream, but i'm not dropping any frames. It's weird
[2226.64s -> 2230.32s]  That's oh sometimes it does that and if it does that just back out. It's fine
[2230.40s -> 2235.50s]  I'm just trying to get a problem on this map mrs. Your stream's blocked so you can turn it off. Oh shit
[2235.58s -> 2237.58s]  Really? Yeah, I don't know why

[2678.88s -> 2684.81s]  This track is yeah exactly it is such a short map so it just that's it this fucking it dies immediately
[2685.21s -> 2689.18s]  Okay, 16 points
[2689.58s -> 2693.90s]  Dude, I feel like this this my beetle's not that good because the boost on the beetle is really bad
[2695.13s -> 2698.94s]  Hey, feel free to switch it up. You should go with the wiggler. I might
[2699.58s -> 2705.82s]  I don't think he has the wiggler. I'm trying as hard as I can right now. This is my worst mat
[2709.32s -> 2715.23s]  You're donkey pong. You can build up speed behind me. Yeah, there you go. Wait, I got a red who's ever in second
[2715.23s -> 2717.36s]  I can throw the cut
[2717.36s -> 2721.90s]  Yeah
[2721.90s -> 2723.02s]  Fuck
[2723.02s -> 2725.34s]  It's so hard to coordinate who to throw things to
[2726.22s -> 2731.28s]  What the fuck's that thing?
[2731.28s -> 2737.52s]  Oh, yeah, you have to dodge it the the the scary boy. Who's uh, who's the first they have um, they have blue
[2737.68s -> 2742.24s]  Oh, he's a blue germa. I'm a whole blue ante. That's what you call me. All right, there you go

[2762.56s -> 2764.56s]  No, you're good. No, I'm not good
[2770.89s -> 2782.78s]  I'm terrible. Okay. I don't touch anybody. I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. We are all in last place. This is really bad
[2783.42s -> 2785.42s]  Yeah
[2786.94s -> 2789.42s]  You got triple reds in second fuck you quinn
[2791.34s -> 2794.54s]  I have a blue shell. I have a blue shell. Should I throw it? Oh, yeah
[2794.78s -> 2798.54s]  Wait, that's over. Oh, I got second. Damn it. We got rocked
[2800.14s -> 2804.46s]  I'm, I was literally on the edge. I got hit knocked off. It was over
[2806.04s -> 2808.76s]  That was a great play earlier though germa when you threw the blue
[2809.08s -> 2812.68s]  I I triple tapped somebody with green shells. That was my fault. I'm sorry
[2813.24s -> 2817.88s]  It worked out it worked. It just clinked out double reds behind me in second. I couldn't do anything
[2823.50s -> 2825.58s]  We should still be first. I think
[2828.38s -> 2830.86s]  Keep the morale up. All right, is it big on a favorite track?
[2831.58s -> 2834.14s]  Baby mark the baby one the baby. I've been
[2835.82s -> 2839.50s]  We could gamble with babies. Let's run. Let's run baby park. Fuck it. Which one is it in?
[2841.26s -> 2843.02s]  Dude
[2843.02s -> 2846.14s]  I had that man. That's what it's in at the leaf the animal crossing one
[2847.47s -> 2852.27s]  Yeah, baby park is pure rng. That is a is that is that the did they update it already?
[2854.52s -> 2857.88s]  I'm down for baby park or yoshi. So the baby park is it is a gamble
[2858.52s -> 2860.52s]  Yoshi, you don't want that. That's the best track
[2861.16s -> 2863.72s]  Really? I oh, I love that track
[2863.72s -> 2868.60s]  Yeah, i've never seen clint lose them stream looks good. No. Yeah, i'm sorry guys. I have no idea why that was happening
[2869.16s -> 2871.60s]  This is bizarre. Sorry
[2871.76s -> 2880.03s]  Seems like it's fixed now. Let's go. Oh shit. We're we're ahead by like seven points only six points
[2880.03s -> 2883.39s]  Okay, if you get a mushroom go through the middle, you're probably gonna get a mushroom
[2883.55s -> 2887.90s]  So just be wary and go through the middle. It can literally make or break you. Okay
[2893.85s -> 2901.58s]  Hold the mushroom for the middle
[2901.58s -> 2902.86s]  What hit me?
[2902.86s -> 2905.98s]  Uh, I think I just popped I have shells circling me and I think I got too close
[2906.54s -> 2912.97s]  Okay
[2912.97s -> 2914.97s]  Oh
[2915.45s -> 2919.93s]  This is what mario cries like now, huh?
[2920.25s -> 2921.37s]  It's fun
[2921.37s -> 2938.33s]  I mean like that
[2938.33s -> 2940.33s]  It's 10 coins for max speed, right?
[2940.57s -> 2953.50s]  Yeah. All right. Nice
[2953.82s -> 2955.98s]  I deserve that. Oh jesus. Oh, okay
[2956.62s -> 2958.75s]  I just ruined mango's life
[2958.75s -> 2963.60s]  Okay, i'm right behind mango now

[2970.78s -> 2973.82s]  Oh alinity, i'm sorry. Oh wait, never mind
[2973.98s -> 2975.18s]  All right
[2975.18s -> 2977.18s]  All right. I'm in third. Oh my god
[2978.38s -> 2980.86s]  If anybody gets a blue call it out and matt can go behind
[2990.43s -> 2991.56s]  Got him
[2991.56s -> 2996.68s]  I got a bullet to careful
[2997.96s -> 3001.80s]  Clint has a red shell in first
[3001.80s -> 3003.80s]  They must wait good blue good blue
[3003.88s -> 3006.68s]  Blue's coming matt blue's coming coming guys. Fuck i'm good
[3007.48s -> 3012.88s]  I'm pulling from the back
[3012.88s -> 3014.88s]  Please swear god. Yeah, you should have used it
[3016.22s -> 3017.90s]  Who was in first?
[3017.90s -> 3018.94s]  me
[3018.94s -> 3021.82s]  You need to go behind clinton in the blue. I couldn't I was too far ahead
[3022.62s -> 3025.18s]  It looked like you were that far ahead. Oh shit. I was
[3027.61s -> 3028.97s]  I was getting first
[3028.97s -> 3030.97s]  I was doing good, too
[3030.97s -> 3036.97s]  I couldn't I literally stopped. Oh, wait, apparently that's a tough one. Clint saw it coming and clint stopped too. That's what happened
[3036.97s -> 3041.13s]  That's all right. We got second third and fourth. That's good. Oh, that's good. We got yeah, we got second
[3042.81s -> 3044.33s]  Overall, yeah
[3044.33s -> 3050.68s]  Oh, yeah, that was overall. So someone must have told clint that that was coming and clint stopped as well
[3050.84s -> 3052.22s]  So
[3052.22s -> 3054.54s]  What should I get for a car for something that has no idea what's going on?
[3055.26s -> 3057.26s]  What should I do? I'm trying to drift i'm trying to learn
[3058.06s -> 3061.63s]  What do I do?
[3061.63s -> 3063.07s]  drifting too much
[3063.07s -> 3066.44s]  What car should I have?
[3066.44s -> 3068.83s]  drift more often
[3068.83s -> 3072.35s]  I don't even remember. No, we definitely didn't win that round. We definitely lost points. I don't want to talk about it
[3072.35s -> 3076.27s]  I think we lost alan we need to just go through our g here. Yeah, we're probably tied
[3077.64s -> 3081.66s]  We're probably tied. Yeah, we were up seven. So I think it's going to be very close
[3082.81s -> 3085.93s]  Do you guys want to comment on why you are so adamant on going to baby park?
[3086.89s -> 3093.21s]  Rng, baby, what do you like? Okay, you want the gamble? Yeah, actually i'm now suede i'm on your side
[3094.17s -> 3098.33s]  It's all it's okay. It's track twice. It's been clint's track twice in a row
[3098.33s -> 3103.05s]  That is you want to talk about this you want to talk about a little weird a little weird. Um, okay
[3103.05s -> 3105.05s]  It's updated. We are oh
[3105.53s -> 3112.40s]  We're losing by two points guys. Okay. Okay. I can't come in last place. I'm trying i'm trying not to have that happen
[3112.88s -> 3114.40s]  No, no, you got
[3114.40s -> 3116.40s]  On the side early because then you get full coins
[3117.98s -> 3119.66s]  Oh, do you?
[3119.66s -> 3121.02s]  Yes
[3121.02s -> 3126.40s]  I didn't take your advice
[3126.40s -> 3129.76s]  Yeah, me neither. I forgot where it was. Okay. I'm with you preso in third
[3130.40s -> 3146.52s]  I'm with you preso. He's got he's got a bomb
[3147.16s -> 3150.68s]  He's always got bombs man
[3157.44s -> 3161.63s]  No, it pushed me. I'm sorry. I forgot i'm like live on your guys channels. I'm sorry
[3163.71s -> 3166.73s]  What the hell just happened i'm getting
[3167.45s -> 3177.68s]  Fucked up a bit. I'm in third behind you preso. Let me get hit by it
[3183.84s -> 3186.80s]  Uh preso, I have a red if you want to toss that i'll get in front and toss it again
[3187.52s -> 3188.48s]  Sure
[3188.48s -> 3191.76s]  Let me get oh
[3191.76s -> 3193.04s]  Wow
[3193.04s -> 3195.04s]  Guys guys guys, uh
[3196.24s -> 3198.48s]  Connecting time so this is a four fun race
[3199.92s -> 3201.12s]  Wait, what happened?
[3201.12s -> 3208.08s]  Wubbies thing disconnected, uh, he's in the in the lobby still he just for some reason it loaded longer than everyone else
[3209.04s -> 3215.76s]  So this is purely for fun race it won't count and if it happens again, we'll just remove like bottom two scores for exhibition
[3216.56s -> 3220.72s]  Dude, I I hate people that just make us like lap the weight all the time. It just drives me nuts
[3221.36s -> 3223.36s]  Like I don't know
[3224.00s -> 3226.00s]  I actually just get him out of here
[3235.45s -> 3237.45s]  Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right
[3237.61s -> 3239.45s]  Ha ha ha
[3239.45s -> 3243.21s]  Taking out connor holding me back because you guys man taking out connor part two
[3244.88s -> 3247.12s]  He wasn't expecting that one. It worked second time
[3249.36s -> 3258.70s]  No, you suck hurry up, why am I so slow? Uh, go same map go same map
[3261.58s -> 3264.70s]  Remember you're trying so hard. I really am I don't want to come in last place every time
[3265.26s -> 3273.52s]  Because now the final score is fucked
[3273.60s -> 3279.12s]  That was weird though, because I saw paid money right next to me the whole time so yeah, was it a bot or
[3280.00s -> 3282.96s]  Wait, wait, why do you want us to all just click the path zero, right?
[3284.16s -> 3286.16s]  Oh, I didn't do that. Might be
[3286.16s -> 3290.88s]  Oh, I thought we had to hit f0. Yeah, you're right. No, you're you're right. I wasn't paying attention. Neither was preso
[3291.52s -> 3293.52s]  Where's f0?
[3301.05s -> 3305.61s]  Oh shit, I didn't know why I'm listening to directions once dude. This is fun. It's fuck. We should just like once a week
[3307.71s -> 3312.43s]  Yeah, the problem is that we selected 12 races so even though we want to play another we'll have to
[3313.39s -> 3315.39s]  So he said this guy sucks
[3315.79s -> 3318.75s]  I i've played mario kart like three times
[3323.80s -> 3328.35s]  It is this is a very close winner loss like these teams are pretty tight
[3328.51s -> 3333.55s]  We need to just get first first second and third because it just powers you we need we need to get top two

[4828.27s -> 4834.35s]  That is how it works using the word deserve when there's a giant blue shell that goes from 12th to first to lift light them up
[4834.99s -> 4836.99s]  It's a little clean. What did you get that round?
[4838.11s -> 4840.11s]  seven

[4849.95s -> 4857.76s]  But you know, it gets the job done. They were you saying stop tryharding. Did I have to at least not come in last place, man?
[4859.85s -> 4861.85s]  Simply was nasty in teams. What's going on?

[5057.26s -> 5059.26s]  He bought it out. Yeah, dude
[5061.20s -> 5066.24s]  Prezo had a channel bet whether you would get first place or not and uh 90 people lost all their channel points
[5066.88s -> 5068.24s]  Let's go
[5068.24s -> 5070.24s]  What the fuck did you press you got first?
[5070.88s -> 5074.00s]  Yeah, I got first. The prediction was literally will prezo get first

[5150.06s -> 5152.22s]  Oh my fucking god. Are you kidding me?
[5153.47s -> 5167.04s]  All right, it's not over
[5167.04s -> 5182.65s]  Get out of the sand

[5259.63s -> 5265.95s]  Hit by everything starting with the simply dodging grabbing my double double items hitting me with it
[5266.91s -> 5269.87s]  Yeah, did those fireballs hit you by chance? I threw a couple back
[5270.89s -> 5274.41s]  Shut up fireballs hit me when I was in fourth at the end and I finished 11th
[5275.21s -> 5277.21s]  I'm desperately just trying to
[5277.37s -> 5279.55s]  Not be in the last place
[5279.55s -> 5281.55s]  Dude, it's this bike. I'm not playing with it anymore
[5283.15s -> 5285.15s]  Oh my god, that was dreadful
[5286.83s -> 5288.83s]  It's definitely bike for sure
[5291.00s -> 5293.18s]  You sound like a flustered grandma
[5293.76s -> 5297.92s]  I could I probably couldn't be your grandma right now. I mean, i'm probably like old enough to be your grandma
[5298.48s -> 5301.04s]  And i'm kind of flustered so it makes a little sense
[5302.57s -> 5304.57s]  Just get away from me

[5341.08s -> 5343.52s]  What happened? What the fuck was that?
[5354.70s -> 5356.54s]  Oh shit, that could have been me
[5356.54s -> 5368.40s]  That could have been me
[5368.40s -> 5370.16s]  Oh shit
[5370.16s -> 5372.40s]  I have zero fucking coins
[5373.20s -> 5388.88s]  I need to collect coins right now
[5388.88s -> 5401.44s]  It's coin collection time. Give me those. I fucking missed all the coins
[5409.28s -> 5411.28s]  Holy shit that went right by me
[5420.43s -> 5425.68s]  Get out of the way

[5468.76s -> 5471.32s]  Dead air i'm trying so hard to concentrate
[5473.66s -> 5476.60s]  Uh, this is the worst moment of my life. I'll take that
[5478.57s -> 5484.73s]  Wait, how did how did I just got first place if i'm in if I got fifth is it because everybody that was ahead of me
[5484.73s -> 5486.91s]  Just got screwed over
[5486.91s -> 5491.07s]  Yeah, there was non-stop bumper cars at the end. That was pure luck. Whoever got top five
[5491.79s -> 5493.31s]  Yeah
[5493.31s -> 5497.71s]  I will say clint had no competition for first on that one. No, he didn't he did not. I mean
[5498.35s -> 5500.59s]  charlie was close and then
[5500.83s -> 5502.83s]  I hit him like three times
[5503.07s -> 5505.07s]  And we're having fun. Stop stressing
[5505.63s -> 5507.63s]  I'm just fucking around. Don't worry
[5508.84s -> 5512.84s]  He never ever talked his manner known him. That was fucked up dude. Wait alivia
[5512.84s -> 5516.36s]  You're like you dropped that bomb in the first round. What do you want from me?
[5517.08s -> 5518.44s]  You paint it back
[5518.44s -> 5522.36s]  Wait, who's in first who's in first right now alivia is in first place with

[5524.60s -> 5528.76s]  What if we play i'm gonna i'm gonna drive the wrong way and just try to drive into the person in first place
[5529.40s -> 5531.85s]  And you understand that right?
[5531.85s -> 5534.01s]  Become inaccurate if someone drops or something
[5535.05s -> 5539.13s]  Oh, no
[5539.13s -> 5541.69s]  That's such vm like I don't think I could get away with it
[5542.41s -> 5544.41s]  In the race for the money who are
[5544.57s -> 5546.57s]  In eleven
[5550.97s -> 5556.49s]  Sixth place is prezzo and he's tied with connor or no one behind connor who's the seventh?
[5557.29s -> 5559.29s]  Uh charlie
[5565.37s -> 5567.77s]  Yeah, that's 12th place lead uh hit me pretty hard
[5568.97s -> 5573.88s]  I need coins
[5593.82s -> 5599.85s]  Bananas everywhere jesus, there is a lot of bananas. I know they're everywhere. It's insane
[5605.85s -> 5610.73s]  Dude, baby park is the one map where I like lean with every turn like my body
[5611.29s -> 5613.29s]  Holding the controller can't stay still
[5622.84s -> 5626.36s]  Oh, don't touch me and there I go there goes my lead what the fuck
[5627.00s -> 5632.22s]  There goes everything I worked for in life. It's over
[5633.02s -> 5635.26s]  Oh my god, that was a perfect time
[5643.28s -> 5648.91s]  That was perfect timing to use the star
[5649.63s -> 5657.15s]  I I played that so well and I still got ninth like I I clutched every turn and then one red hits me
[5658.04s -> 5663.24s]  We just got a new spot coming in. There's a secret gift for random placing between fifth and twelfth
[5664.04s -> 5670.04s]  Oh, what? Oh, that's big random number generator five through twelve and then one of them you're scared
[5671.16s -> 5676.04s]  Uh, no, no, I wouldn't do that clint. Can you do a placey one? What's the shittiest one grumble volcano, right?
[5677.47s -> 5683.95s]  Last one in what way the grumble volcano is like the worst course grumble. I like it actually. Oh, all right
[5684.43s -> 5688.83s]  Cool clan pick boom metals are scared thousands castles. I think people are pretty bad
[5689.39s -> 5704.86s]  Toad's turnpike. Oh shit. Is it actually gonna do it? No, let jex play
[5706.65s -> 5713.69s]  I've definitely improved. Okay, like the first like four or five races, especially I literally had blindfold on
[5715.47s -> 5724.49s]  All right, I got I got at least place in the top six. Let's go. Hold on eyes eyes my eyes
[5730.49s -> 5732.49s]  That's what you get. You gotta knock somebody out right at the beginning
[5747.88s -> 5754.09s]  This one hurts my head. Oh
[5755.07s -> 5757.63s]  It's fine. Relax like five people just did that
[5760.89s -> 5778.06s]  Oh fuck that. No
[5778.06s -> 5779.64s]  Whoa
[5779.64s -> 5780.84s]  Whoa
[5780.84s -> 5800.88s]  I'm fine. What did me? Uh, oh watch this shit
[5801.60s -> 5805.84s]  How do I how do I cycle between items? How do you cycle between items?
[5806.48s -> 5808.24s]  I'm gonna hold this to the very end
[5808.24s -> 5812.70s]  How do you cycle between items? You can't
[5813.58s -> 5816.54s]  What what's fucking happen? What is that? It's gonna same two items again
[5819.12s -> 5838.94s]  Just use it. Whatever
[5838.94s -> 5842.62s]  Seventh fucking place whatever height squeeze
[5844.46s -> 5852.25s]  Brutal just keep getting last place man. It's really unfortunate. Why did you sit there?
[5853.21s -> 5856.43s]  Simply he's coming for a long time. I saw him my controller
[5859.15s -> 5867.23s]  I'm just gonna start waiting non-stop. How many more races do we have? I believe that was
[5869.07s -> 5873.23s]  Five more. All right. All right. Oh, wow. Holy fuck. There's still plenty of time to uh to pull this back
[5874.19s -> 5878.83s]  Oh plenty of time. That's what I was thinking. I'm gonna get first place every time now. I'm actually gonna start playing
[5883.10s -> 5885.58s]  Whoever used lightning in the last game is a fucking hero
[5886.54s -> 5889.74s]  Thank you clint. Didn't you have a a star during that too?
[5891.12s -> 5896.80s]  I did that I had a star during that. Oh, are you trying to imply that I don't deserve to get second because I get a star
[5897.76s -> 5903.68s]  Yes, I I think third is more up your alley, you know, I will see on this one
[5904.00s -> 5916.67s]  What does it do the imposter is sus face? No, just go google it. That's okay. I'm still in eighth place
[5916.91s -> 5919.28s]  So I think both of us are great
[5920.19s -> 5922.19s]  Really? Yeah, I don't know why everything's so cocky
[5929.20s -> 5932.28s]  Oh, that's a trap jam
[5932.28s -> 5934.28s]  Turn into a mud bath immediately
[5935.79s -> 5938.27s]  Oh fuck. Oh, that was a scary thing
[5941.74s -> 5943.74s]  Okay, goodness. This place is ridiculous
[5944.06s -> 5946.00s]  Okay
[5946.00s -> 5950.27s]  Okay
[5950.27s -> 5954.99s]  Oh, I hit his hand. I just jumped over that. Oh, I can't believe I jumped over
[5957.69s -> 5959.69s]  This map is wacky
[5975.72s -> 5977.00s]  shit
[5977.00s -> 5981.39s]  All right back in it
[5981.39s -> 5983.39s]  How am I so far away?
[5983.47s -> 5988.54s]  It's absurd

[6003.90s -> 6007.84s]  He's first. He's in first, but he's me
[6008.80s -> 6011.10s]  If you just keep asking him questions, he'll get rattled
[6013.10s -> 6018.33s]  Me and manga are going after him
[6028.00s -> 6030.00s]  Come on no get away from me

[6070.27s -> 6074.59s]  Did clint drive off the level? What happened there? Yeah, I drove off the level
[6076.19s -> 6082.99s]  Unnecessary place of all time and then drove off the level charlie. That was so unnecessary. You rammed me
[6084.11s -> 6086.11s]  Wait, how did I get second?
[6086.19s -> 6088.83s]  Is this my first time playing mario kart? No, but come on

[6130.56s -> 6134.80s]  I I my eyes were red. I I just full of rage. I'm, sorry
[6135.12s -> 6138.96s]  I do one impression and this happens that was so unneeded rage quit at the ninth race
[6139.28s -> 6142.88s]  I think it was actually me that hit you miss. It's race where I drove. No, it's charlie
[6142.88s -> 6148.08s]  I literally saw charlie rammed me at the star and I hit you with fireballs on my screen
