[0.31s -> 18.27s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Basecamp Fortress 2. Playing as the Pyro on Gorge on offense. Can I get this heavy?
[18.27s -> 26.94s]  Yoey! There's a one. And that what? I'm getting quick fixed. Oh, he moved. I'll get him right here. I'll get him right here. I'll get him right here.
[26.94s -> 41.09s]  Hey, what's up, dude? The quick fix. Come here, scout. I will get you. So I got this medic on me. Quick fix medic, baby.
[41.09s -> 53.40s]  That guy just disappeared. Sentry. Oh, there's no way. I need help. I need help. I need help. I need help. Come here, you.
[58.67s -> 63.66s]  Come on. You are not getting away. There's no way this guy's getting away. He got away.
[63.66s -> 69.67s]  Of course. I say there's no way he's getting away and he gets freaking away. I'm such an idiot.
[69.67s -> 78.35s]  Don't worry. Don't worry. I got this. Don't worry. Oh, don't worry. Don't worry about a thing.
[78.35s -> 91.09s]  No, medic. What? What did the bug up? Where did he come from? Whatever. Get right back into this here.
[91.09s -> 101.71s]  By the way, that's not Dr. Pepper. Blasphemy, I know. It's actually what? What is this? Sparkling grapefruit juice.
[101.71s -> 111.61s]  What kind of weird bastard am I that I'm drinking sparkling grapefruit juice? What planet am I even from?
[111.61s -> 121.47s]  Hit that sniper. Dude, that sniper is like going like this. What the hell is the medic doing back here?
[121.47s -> 126.78s]  Walk into it. Oh, you lucky butt head.
[126.78s -> 132.97s]  So if you're watching this right now, I am currently in North Carolina visiting my sister.
[132.97s -> 140.14s]  Some of you old subscribers will know that I do that every now and then. I think I went there last time during Thanksgiving.
[140.14s -> 149.45s]  Come here. Got him. Got him. Yeah, I went there last Thanksgiving. It was a really good time.
[149.45s -> 153.45s]  It's a really beautiful house, really beautiful place down there in North Carolina.
[153.45s -> 162.51s]  Dove before he gets that stupid thing off. I'm supposed to hit him. I don't even tell you the load that I'm using either.
[162.51s -> 169.69s]  I'm using the flare gun, the regular just standard flamethrower and the power jack.
[169.69s -> 175.32s]  We need to push this point. We need to get rid of that sentry. Can we take it out? Can I get it right now?
[175.32s -> 183.55s]  Come on. Keep messing with that engineer. Yes. How did I not hit him with that?
[183.55s -> 193.51s]  No. Get on zipped point. Hello. There you go. What's going on, medic? Thank you for the heals.
[193.51s -> 208.04s]  Much appreciate. Damn it. Shouldn't have done that. Mr. Winslow with the face plant. He's AFK.
[208.04s -> 218.36s]  That's not a good thing. You can't be AFK, man. No, none of you guys are spies. Spy check.
[218.36s -> 234.55s]  Spy check. Why? What was that lag? Oh, I was just choked. Wow.
[234.55s -> 240.93s]  I can't believe I actually killed that son of a bitch. Get rid of that sentry. Come on. Yeah.
[240.93s -> 246.93s]  Tan him again. Do it again. Keep messing with that engineer. Keep messing with him. Yes.
[246.93s -> 254.94s]  Need some help here. Need some help here. Get me out of there. Damn it. That same heavies.
[254.94s -> 266.38s]  We got to get on that point. Big time. How many sentries are over there? I'm going to go around the left side this time.
[266.38s -> 275.43s]  No, no, no. Where are you going? You're not going to... This guy's probably going to kill me.
[275.43s -> 282.38s]  No, I'm going to miss, but that's all right because he's... Where is he? Where the hell is this guy going?
[282.38s -> 292.82s]  I'll find you. And when I find you, you're going to get your face ripped off. I'll take it. I'll take it.
[292.82s -> 300.78s]  How can I not hit the guy that's standing still? Why are they both doing that? Why are they both doing this?
[301.78s -> 310.10s]  How many is it going to take to kill this son of a... All right. Fine. I'll just smash you.
[310.10s -> 326.08s]  You want to get smashed? God. Oh my God. That was terrifying. Didn't even need to hit him.
[326.08s -> 333.86s]  We're going to lose. Come on. Give me those heals. Turn around. Turn around, man.
[333.86s -> 341.83s]  I got to try and kill that engineer. That's what I wanted. Get him. Hit him.
[341.83s -> 350.74s]  I'm trying to wait for him just to come across the middle. Oh, this is not good. We're so dead. We're so dead.
[351.74s -> 356.88s]  Wait. Demoman, go. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[356.88s -> 366.62s]  Yeah. Can I get there in 15 seconds? I don't think I'm going to be able to get there in 15 seconds.
[368.18s -> 382.67s]  What? What? What on earth? I landed on top of that guy's head. Oh my God.
[382.67s -> 386.42s]  Okay. That's the first time that's ever happened to me.
[386.42s -> 390.42s]  Imagine if I had the Mantreads on. That guy would have been tombastomped.
[390.42s -> 394.79s]  Itch. Defense. Damn. Let's play a little bit of the defense.
[394.79s -> 401.67s]  Nice sentry. Very good start. Sniper. Trying to shoot me in my face. And a heavy.
[401.67s -> 410.64s]  This guy's not going to... Maybe he is. I got to get behind him. Come here.
[410.64s -> 418.02s]  Somebody just come here. Two scouts. I'll wrap around you. Yeah.
[418.02s -> 422.64s]  Give me a heal, man. I need a heal. I need a heal.
[422.64s -> 431.82s]  Damn. You are a jumpy little freak. Close him in here. Close him in big time.
[431.82s -> 439.51s]  No. No. No. Everybody get blown out. This guy's got crits. I'm trying to blow people out.
[439.51s -> 452.18s]  No. Run. Get him. Please. Please die. He's still alive.
[452.18s -> 460.65s]  Oh. No. He died that far. That long after I shot him. He needed to get a health kit.
[460.65s -> 465.23s]  Click, click, click, click, click. They're going to capture this.
[465.23s -> 470.62s]  No. We can't lose two in a row. We got to hold them for four minutes. Come on, dudes.
[470.62s -> 478.28s]  I might have to switch off pyro. That's something that might have to happen here.
[478.28s -> 484.91s]  Any spies? Don't think so. Medic. That medic is just standing back there.
[484.91s -> 493.35s]  Oh my god. That's a second sick shot of the day. Wrap it up and give it to me for Christmas.
[493.35s -> 498.85s]  Stay away from the sentry. Get this stuff away from the sentry. I got you. Don't worry, buddy. I got you.
[498.85s -> 506.31s]  I got you. Protecting your sentry. Nothing's going to take this down unless a spy comes behind us.
[506.31s -> 512.43s]  We good? That dome man still hanging out here? No, but there's a sniper right there.
[512.43s -> 522.50s]  Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. I'm trying, man. There's nothing I can do, really.
[522.50s -> 526.68s]  I'm trying to kill him. They came from behind.
[526.68s -> 534.74s]  Oh, now we got to hold this for 11 minutes. We're going to get smoked right here.
[534.74s -> 542.51s]  We are going to get absolutely smoked. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.
[542.51s -> 548.10s]  But as you're watching this right now, I'll be on the plane to North Carolina, like I said.
[548.10s -> 552.34s]  Should be a great time. I love my sister, as I'm sure a lot of you guys have siblings.
[552.34s -> 556.90s]  Never get to see her that often anymore, which is unfortunate, but I'm going to die.
[556.90s -> 566.46s]  Give me a crit. Do we have anything on the blast point? I don't think so.
[566.46s -> 575.59s]  I think we're just dead. No, no, no. We're going to go demo.
[575.59s -> 579.79s]  You could always go demo and try to make something crazy happen.
[579.79s -> 591.50s]  Three on the point. Oh, well, that's going to wrap up Face Game Fortress, guys.
[591.50s -> 594.50s]  I'll see you all next time. And I got something going up tomorrow.
[594.50s -> 599.50s]  I got Scare Saturdays. Scare Saturdays is returning tomorrow with the game Gray,
[599.50s -> 602.68s]  the Half-Life 2 mod Gray. So look forward to that.
[602.68s -> 607.11s]  I'll see you guys when I get back on Sunday. And of course, take care, everybody.
