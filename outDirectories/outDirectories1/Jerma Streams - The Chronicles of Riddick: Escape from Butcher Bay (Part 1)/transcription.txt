[0.95s -> 18.66s]  Good morning, what's up? Welcome to another stream. Today, we're gonna play the Chronicles of Riddick
[18.66s -> 26.89s]  Assault on Dark Athena. But actually, it's the Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher's Bay,
[26.89s -> 34.70s]  which is Assault on Dark Athena, is the game. It's a remake of Butcher's Bay that added a
[34.70s -> 45.37s]  campaign on top. Some weird development issues happened. This game is a remake of the last game
[45.45s -> 57.99s]  with a small campaign added on top, so we're playing the remake. This is bullshit. Dark Athena
[57.99s -> 65.69s]  is the sequel. Dark Athena is the sequel, but it has a remade Butcher's Bay in it. Go look it up.
[65.69s -> 70.57s]  There's some, there's a lot of things with how assets were being sold during, I believe, was it
[70.57s -> 75.29s]  was a THQ? I don't want to make this up. Let's see. I think it was something to do with that,
[75.29s -> 82.94s]  right? Saw waiting room? Well, don't worry. Saw 2 is going to be really soon. Uh, yeah, we're
[82.94s -> 89.80s]  gonna play. I have a confession to make though. I have never seen any of the Riddick movies at all.
[89.80s -> 94.04s]  I have no idea what this is. I don't know. All I know is that the character wears sunglasses. I
[94.04s -> 99.24s]  have no idea what's going on. I remember watching the trailer list for this movie back in the day.
[99.24s -> 102.78s]  There's like four of them or three of them or something and it's, and they were pretty
[102.78s -> 111.56s]  people liked them. From my understanding, this game is not just a movie game. This is a completely
[111.56s -> 118.68s]  new campaign that Vin Diesel himself oversaw. Am I getting that right? So this is not just a
[118.68s -> 128.73s]  movie tie-in. Vin Diesel made this game. Like he made it happen. He's in it. He voices it. He
[128.73s -> 132.81s]  wrote all the dialogue and he programmed all the encounters. So can we give it up for Vin Diesel
[132.81s -> 153.48s]  for just a moment, please? All right. Are you guys ready? I'm, I'm ready to go. I've been ready for
[153.48s -> 159.58s]  about 25 minutes. It just, I have no references to make for the Chronicles of Riddick. So making a
[159.58s -> 165.88s]  title was impossible. So I just reached into the YouTuber handbook and I got a good one.
[165.88s -> 184.12s]  Okay. Here we go. This is Escape from Butcher's Bay, but it's Dark Athena. See? See? See, I told
[184.12s -> 197.08s]  you. There were people in chat going, you idiot. Oh, who's the idiot? Huh? It ain't me. Literally,
[197.08s -> 204.07s]  no one did that. I'm making up somebody to be angry at. No one did that. Not one person. I'm
[204.07s -> 209.03s]  just making everybody think that there's some, some person in the chat room that I'm angry at.
[209.03s -> 215.16s]  This did not happen. I just want to make sure that's pretty clear. All right, let's go. This
[215.16s -> 232.90s]  is from 2004, by the way. Oh, we got to test the audio. One, two. We synced up. Sounds good to me.
[232.90s -> 252.47s]  Slightly off. It's delayed. My voice is early. Hold on. This is really important to do this.
[252.47s -> 256.18s]  Otherwise it's going to be fucked up the whole stream. All right, hold on.
[260.82s -> 276.57s]  One, one, two. Here we go. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
[276.57s -> 292.52s]  One, two. Butcher's Bay. I'm going to play on normal. I don't want to fuck this up. 2004 hard,
[292.52s -> 305.77s]  guys, is not the same as 2020 hard. 2004 hard is you get shot once and die. I'm not doing it.
[305.77s -> 314.58s]  No, this is 2004. This is Escape from Butcher's Bay. What even is this bit? What bit? I'm picking
[314.58s -> 327.58s]  a difficulty. I don't understand this joke. I mean, what, what is this? Is this like pick a door and
[327.58s -> 334.63s]  one of the doors is going to have like something funny behind it? Difficulty bit. All right. I'm
[334.63s -> 338.31s]  going to just pick normal. I don't care. Make fun of me. You can make fun of me all stream if you
[338.31s -> 358.02s]  want. All right. It's already done. It's that's too late. I can't go back. All right. Quiet. We're
[358.02s -> 367.85s]  moving again. They just transmitted a safe route through the minefield. You think Huxley's memory
[367.85s -> 372.25s]  is that Hannibal Lecter? What's going on? Look at you, Riddick and all is forgiven.
[372.25s -> 381.22s]  And I think you're bounding plus 50 plus 50. Greed is an ugly thing. You're in no position to
[381.22s -> 395.54s]  negotiate, Riddick. I'm excited. This is a very highly requested game. I'm excited to play this
[395.62s -> 401.30s]  one. Oh yeah. I forgot you don't like this part. Statistically landings are the most dangerous.
[401.30s -> 407.30s]  You got nothing left to live for, Riddick. I do. I shut up with you. You're already counting it,
[407.30s -> 411.94s]  aren't you? I said shut up. I feel like he could just like duck down and slip out of this.
[412.74s -> 436.78s]  He could just go underneath the bottom bar. All right. Here we go. One person. You're right. One
[436.78s -> 442.14s]  person requested this game. They're going to be really happy. Hey, hold it. You go where I say
[442.86s -> 457.91s]  when I say. What happened? Oh, this game sucks though. You don't know that. Who told you that?
[458.71s -> 465.42s]  You know, how do you have any idea? Walk up to a character and press Y to initiate dialogue mode.
[465.42s -> 490.82s]  Press Y to speak after selecting your response. Why did that happen? Did I game too hard?
[491.78s -> 499.24s]  Okay. Walk up and initiate conversation. Hey, don't fucking move. What about the guy behind
[499.24s -> 507.30s]  you? He's moving. Johns know he should cool down. Scare Johns about being ripped off. Scare him.
[507.30s -> 515.75s]  Today, Johns, you get fucked. You don't move until I say so. Hey, hey, hold it. You go where I say
[516.39s -> 519.99s]  when I say. He just stepped on his head. I just wanted to look around. Wait, am I not supposed to
[519.99s -> 536.36s]  move? Why? It's because I know why. I know why. I know why. I know why. I know why. I know why.
[537.37s -> 541.85s]  This is kind of loose. That's not good. I got to tape this. I don't know about you guys,
[541.85s -> 546.73s]  but seriously, I'm like a fucking animal when I have a controller and I have to tap a button.
[547.77s -> 551.85s]  When I tap right trigger, I'm actually pressing every button and I'm squeezing really hard.
[555.46s -> 559.22s]  The thing that's holding the battery on is going to fall off. Don't fucking move.
[561.02s -> 569.58s]  Today, Johns, you get fucked. You don't move until I say so. Hey, hey, hold it. You go where I say
[570.22s -> 574.30s]  when I say. I just wanted to look around. This is red light, green light.
[578.92s -> 588.31s]  Yeah. Wait, what? You didn't hear me? How do you not hear him? Info, sneak up behind Johns and
[588.31s -> 594.31s]  grab him by pressing left trigger to silently break his neck. You can also perform a faster
[594.31s -> 603.34s]  but louder neck break by pressing right trigger. Break his neck. I don't want to. Why don't you do
[603.34s -> 620.92s]  it? Oh, it should break his neck. DNA protection learns the hard way. We should get moving.
[622.78s -> 636.87s]  How do I get in? Where am I? Get in. Get in here quick. Oh shit, I got fucking killed.
[637.59s -> 650.06s]  What? Jump. It goes into third person. That's awesome. Oh, and you got a Dark Souls drag
[650.06s -> 657.19s]  down. Are you kidding me? Cigarettes. That's a pat. Yep. Extra content. Butcher Bay is now
[657.19s -> 666.17s]  available in the extra content menu. I think it's too dark. Did I make the brightness a little bit
[666.17s -> 681.27s]  higher? I'm not a boss. How? Make it a little bit higher. A little bit higher. 55. It's a little
[681.27s -> 694.44s]  better, I think. OK, so now now what do we do? Inmate on the run. Wait, you can fight hand to
[694.44s -> 698.68s]  hand with enemies. Press RT to punch and LT to block. Try to move in different directions and
[698.68s -> 719.99s]  punch at the same time to perform different strikes. Unauthorized. My god. OK, I think he's
[719.99s -> 727.64s]  dead. How can you be unauthorized to pick up a gun? I don't understand. Oh, security card.
[730.82s -> 741.48s]  They just showed you that they're locked. Yeah, well, I'm what do you want to do? They already
[741.48s -> 747.64s]  explained it. Yeah, but I someone said my controller was like falling out and I was I'm trying to be
[747.64s -> 759.64s]  very, very careful with the controller right now. Anything over here? No. On stealth mode,
[759.64s -> 765.48s]  press X for stealth. You sneak silently. A blue screen effect indicates that no one can see you.
[766.12s -> 784.62s]  Well, he can't see me. It's just me in the shower, man. Drop him. Yeah. Yeah.
[790.55s -> 796.63s]  Hide the body. It's completely dark. Hold the left bumper down and move left, right or forward
[796.63s -> 806.33s]  and lean in that direction. Releasing you will lean, do lean mode. Drag a body, stand close to
[806.33s -> 817.02s]  the body and press Y. Press Y again. You must be in stealth mode to do this. OK, there are probably
[817.02s -> 820.46s]  other guards around. Hide this body in the dark or his friends will be alerted when they find him.
[820.46s -> 832.10s]  It's like Hitman. Wait, me being invisible, does that make him invisible too? What am I supposed to
[832.10s -> 852.36s]  do with this guy? Air. Maybe a vent. Throw him in the vent? Leave him in the dark. To climb up
[852.36s -> 860.50s]  something, press Y. OK, well, I'll leave him over here. This is dark. You can tell when it's dark
[860.50s -> 876.74s]  because it gets blue. Yeah, he's good. The third person is, I love that. It's so funny. My games
[876.74s -> 887.10s]  stopped doing that, didn't they? How do I climb up? Use a hang rail. Look at it and press Y or
[887.10s -> 892.55s]  jump onto it for pressing A. There's a hang rail above you. Drop him a hang rail, press Y. OK.
[893.19s -> 898.25s]  Hang rail. What else you got? You can drop down on enemies that are far below to kill them and
[898.25s -> 905.10s]  break your fall to your best. That's so clumsy. I thought it was going to be like,
[905.10s -> 909.34s]  use your intuition to throw a batarang. No, no, no, no. Just fall on people and kill them.
[920.82s -> 951.83s]  I mean, I can't even see. All right, I got to hide this guy. OK, we're good. I mean, it's very,
[951.83s -> 962.98s]  you're going to obviously see that, dude, but whatever. Scan my eyes. What does he want me to
[962.98s -> 978.20s]  do now? Can I open this door? On the vent? He came out of here, right? Have something on you?
[978.92s -> 996.28s]  You like a key card? Let's climb it again. I'm sorry. This whole game looks like this,
[996.28s -> 1012.79s]  like a layer of cooking oil put on it. PS3. No, no, no, no. You got it wrong. You got it wrong.
[1012.79s -> 1024.44s]  This is the Xbox 360. It's a much better console than PS3. No, shut up. PS3 is better. No, idiot.
[1024.44s -> 1041.69s]  Rating. Med station. Takes away the hurt, leaves the pain. It's like Half-Life style med stations.
[1042.49s -> 1048.30s]  I don't feel like I'm really small. This nano med health unit is empty. In order to refill it,
[1048.30s -> 1052.30s]  you need to find a refill cartridge and then replace the empty one in the nano med unit by
[1052.30s -> 1065.06s]  pressing Y. OK, what do I have? Two chunks. You can use this refill cartridge to restore an empty
[1065.06s -> 1078.70s]  nano med health unit. That's why it doesn't do the Half-Life sounds. I wouldn't want to use this.
[1079.66s -> 1086.30s]  Don't you think you'd like to have like a bruised elbow? Don't you think you just want to let it
[1086.30s -> 1093.96s]  heal in like a few days? All right, does this thing? OK, that's ready to go. That's horrifying.
[1095.03s -> 1106.66s]  All right, we got to be ready. We got to lean. Disarm our guard. Press right trigger when he
[1106.66s -> 1123.19s]  tries to hit you. It was a parry? Just take the gun. Got it. Shoot. Wow, you have a gun with no
[1123.19s -> 1131.69s]  bullets? What the hell are you doing? Is this just for show? Hold down right bumper and move around
[1131.69s -> 1141.70s]  to select a weapon. Oh, he did. No, that's a pack of cigarettes. He's got too many bullets.
[1143.26s -> 1157.06s]  Tools? He was on break? So? All right, let's go. Dude, I don't care if somebody finds him.
[1157.06s -> 1163.99s]  What does that even matter? While hanging, you can move sideways. Oh, no, somebody's going to
[1163.99s -> 1180.07s]  find him. I don't care. What are Riddick's superpowers? Press right stick to initiate
[1180.07s -> 1195.22s]  weapon melee attack. Oh, he's cool. Oh, he can see in the dark. All right.
[1205.54s -> 1218.46s]  OK, there's one. Is there only one there? Let's see. There's one. This guy's just talking about
[1218.46s -> 1223.98s]  how bad his day was. Just the same shit that I do when I'm in like a car and there's nobody with me.
[1223.98s -> 1242.47s]  I just like go off. Go off, dude. Let's see it. Let's do that forever. No, break his neck. Break
[1242.47s -> 1263.77s]  his neck. Put this gun away. Break his neck. Left trigger. Good. He's talking about this guy. All
[1263.77s -> 1270.07s]  right. I've gotten right. Oh, there's 47 bullets now. We went from zero to this guy has way too
[1270.07s -> 1302.95s]  many. Let's go on the sewers. Where's the way down? Sewers. Jump down. Cool. Oh, the gunplay. Oh,
[1302.95s -> 1316.58s]  the gunplay. You know what I mean? It's actually kind of terrible. Well, not my favorite. Do you
[1316.58s -> 1323.86s]  have a flashlight for those of us that can't see in the dark, Riddick? Yes, you do. Thank you. The
[1323.86s -> 1333.32s]  flashlight attached to shotguns can be used by person. Well, why does he need this? What are you
[1333.32s -> 1358.60s]  doing down here? OK, sewer guards. We got to make sure we guard the sewers. Wait, did I shoot him
[1358.60s -> 1376.46s]  or did he hit his head on the ceiling jumping? I don't know. Is he dead? Yeah, you do. You've got
[1376.46s -> 1390.58s]  to turn the flashlight off. Don't worry. He'll eventually turn this corner. That's Jake the dog.
[1390.58s -> 1420.70s]  Yes, it is. Wait. Shit. He turned the light on when he killed me. Why did I die instantly?
[1420.70s -> 1425.61s]  I was trying to put the body right next to him. How did I die instantly? I don't understand.
[1425.61s -> 1446.98s]  He killed me instantly. I had four health blocks. What did he say? I'm going to die, dude. This is
[1446.98s -> 1459.26s]  game. OK, something else exploded. Why is it dying right down here? I don't remember this happening
[1459.26s -> 1471.38s]  in the movies. All right. I'm fucking going for it now. I'm not going to fuck around. I need to see.
[1471.38s -> 1489.93s]  All right. I don't care if the game's about not seeing. Oh, my God. Are they dead? Wait, what is
[1489.93s -> 1503.34s]  that? I just got. What did I pick up? Like a hologram? How do you reload? You know, I can't
[1503.34s -> 1510.70s]  think of something in a more stupid idea than to put exploding fucking barrels down under the
[1510.70s -> 1536.39s]  gas lines of the town. Rising. Oh, yeah. Hey, boss, where should we put the sixth exploding barrel?
[1537.11s -> 1543.75s]  I don't know. Put it over the corner. I was asleep the whole time.
[1543.91s -> 1547.70s]  I'll act like you're asleep. You're going to be some money.
[1568.73s -> 1571.05s]  Is this like the evil asshole final enemy?
[1573.69s -> 1576.97s]  They already did this. Now play nice so we can get this over with quickly.
[1576.97s -> 1581.08s]  It's already over, John. Secure your weapon, Johns.
[1582.76s -> 1588.44s]  Good to see you too, warden. So the famous Mr. Riddick. The Hawks. Finally come to stay.
[1589.08s -> 1589.64s]  Is this a prison?
[1613.48s -> 1618.44s]  Vin Diesel does this thing where he like purr talks. He's like purring like a kitten.
[1625.93s -> 1630.33s]  Right, Hoxie? I think Riddick about covers what you owe me, Johns.
[1630.33s -> 1634.01s]  There's plenty other slams I can take Riddick to if you can't afford. Vin Diesel should play
[1634.01s -> 1639.45s]  a cool cat in an animated movie. All right. All right. Can't you see him? Cool cat with sunglasses
[1639.45s -> 1645.61s]  on. Extra. No, Riddick stays at Butcher Bay. Period. Full stop. Let's get him processed.
[1645.61s -> 1657.88s]  Yes, sir. I like that one. Johns. Better luck next time. Okay, so we're doing this again.
[1658.68s -> 1670.82s]  Pay attention, punk. You are now Butcher Bay prisoner 542. As to remember your number.
[1670.82s -> 1679.59s]  Can he just run? Oh, come on. Listen, outside. I feel like this is what the new Star Wars
[1679.59s -> 1683.11s]  experience at Disney World is going to be like. Oh, it's me. I'm the prisoner.
[1686.49s -> 1693.38s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where are we going? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Lock me up. Oh, wow. Look.
[1694.10s -> 1698.57s]  Hey, I better be. I better watch out for those guards, right?
[1699.29s -> 1706.73s]  Just wait till they start doing this shit. I can't wait for that, by the way, that like Star Wars
[1706.73s -> 1711.05s]  experience where like you get like arrested and you have to like fight Kylo Ren. That's like a
[1711.05s -> 1735.43s]  $4,000 experience that I'm absolutely going to have. Look at that. Look at that actor.
[1736.15s -> 1752.49s]  On his resume said he could spin guns and shit. This is I love this. Come on. Give me shit. I hear
[1752.49s -> 1767.43s]  a large crowd. Why do I hear a crowd? This is going to turn into Arkham Asylum, isn't it?
[1783.26s -> 1801.90s]  That was a pretty sick walk. Hey, what are you bringing to me? Things his shit don't stick.
[1803.58s -> 1807.98s]  Well, I mean, I have been taking probiotics that's supposed to help with that. But whatever,
[1807.98s -> 1813.82s]  I won't correct it. Really? I'm barber. Come talk to me after the lousy. Okay.
[1814.54s -> 1822.26s]  This is your home. It's time for us to do lousy filthy ass. Don't breathe. And by the way,
[1822.26s -> 1829.10s]  the menu was on the table on the right. It's happy hour right now, by the way. Get in there,
[1829.10s -> 1853.54s]  scumbag. Oh, okay. Nobody likes the nobody likes the like Disney World experience restaurant. Oh,
[1853.54s -> 1867.83s]  okay. Cleansing routines. Wait. Dignity of slam life. Let some mercs think they're in charge.
[1867.83s -> 1877.27s]  Oh, I have to put my hands in the toilet. What is it? Okay. Flush toilet is I open the menu.
[1878.23s -> 1882.79s]  Arbor outside your cell might help you locate the weak spot of this slam. Remember that security
[1882.79s -> 1897.32s]  will notice and take action if you have weapons. I was crouching that whole time. Okay, we're
[1897.32s -> 1903.00s]  going to get why is the door open? Hey, come talk to me for a second. Will you? I thought I was
[1903.00s -> 1908.89s]  supposed to be locked in here. You're really right. But it's a guy named medicine talking
[1908.89s -> 1914.25s]  like he knows you. He's in the courtyard just by the pit. Okay. Thanks a lot, dude.
[1926.73s -> 1935.08s]  Wait, did he do that? Uh, that's, I, you can't, I love games that let me do that.
[1935.64s -> 1939.48s]  You know that if your video game allows me, even if there's a stupid little cut scene where you
[1939.48s -> 1943.72s]  have to run away, if I could just punch a guy and get like in trouble for it, like that's,
[1943.72s -> 1947.24s]  I like that. That's good that they did that. A lot of games don't care. I don't know what
[1947.24s -> 1954.09s]  Maxin wants with you, but I go check it out. If I were you, I can't break his neck though. Right.
[1958.36s -> 1961.24s]  All right. I promise I'm done. I'm probably I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I just want to see if
[1961.24s -> 1969.96s]  I could break his neck. Cause you know, you do realize that if I could break his neck,
[1969.96s -> 1972.52s]  I would have ran around and broke everybody's neck and the whole fucking entire floor.
[1973.24s -> 1976.12s]  He doesn't even want to talk to me anymore. He's just like, maybe if I don't look at him,
[1976.60s -> 1986.47s]  I feel like I have been unfriended. Okay. Who are you? It's the Kozak brother,
[1986.47s -> 1991.91s]  AKA the torture twins locked down yesterday. Managed to get hold of some poor side, obviously.
[1992.47s -> 2003.96s]  Okay. Hey, my advice, do like all the other fish line up. I can't, I have to,
[2003.96s -> 2010.12s]  I have to just take my hand off right trigger. I can't help it. You see this face,
[2011.26s -> 2019.58s]  all things to Molina waste him when they open his cell. Oh, I'll make it worth your while.
[2019.58s -> 2025.48s]  When they open his cell, what is he going to do for me though? I don't, I mean,
[2025.48s -> 2029.96s]  I'm not sure if I want to agree to this because this, this guy's going to be my companion or
[2029.96s -> 2045.18s]  something. It looks like he gets his ass kicked all the time. Uh, yeah, I'll do it. Maybe. Okay.
[2045.18s -> 2050.84s]  What was the guy's name? What cell is his? Hey, what cell is Molina's.
[2052.31s -> 2058.07s]  You won't ever walk into the infirmary punk. Maybe we'll drag you in when rust is finished
[2058.07s -> 2069.54s]  with you. Now piss off. Okay. When they open his cell, kill him. All right. Now I gotta go,
[2069.54s -> 2076.25s]  I gotta do this way. This game's pretty cool. I, I had some of this game. I like this game. This
[2076.25s -> 2100.07s]  is cool. All right. Let's go over here. Who's in here? All right. I'm the toilet guy. That's,
[2100.07s -> 2111.26s]  that's how people know me. That's how you'll remember me. Is it Arnold? All right. I gotta
[2111.26s -> 2117.54s]  find this, this, I gotta find this way to get out of here. Here we go. Yeah.
[2122.18s -> 2127.46s]  You didn't pay your damn long man in the first place. You got that right. You should see Haley.
[2127.46s -> 2131.62s]  He can help you out. You're going to get in trouble with the Aquila measures. I'll tell you.
[2131.62s -> 2136.50s]  Look, go on and talk to Haley. He's the wise man. He used to be a guard, but he turned over to the
[2136.50s -> 2152.74s]  good side. Okay. Everyone has a name. Oh, this Haley is red. I'm looking for the,
[2153.46s -> 2161.06s]  it looks like a way. We got a link here. There's some link spam here.
[2167.05s -> 2173.24s]  You're streaming the Chronicles of British ass. I mean, that's not that funny. That's not that
[2173.24s -> 2177.64s]  funny. If I'm, if I'm going to get a minus two for my Disney world restaurant bit, then that's a
[2177.64s -> 2189.00s]  minus two for like the word ass is in the title. Bugger. You got a problem, huh? Go fuck yourself.
[2190.52s -> 2194.62s]  I got him. I actually hit him. I didn't think that was even, nobody even saw.
[2195.42s -> 2213.43s]  Nobody saw me do that. Shit. Wait, they thought he did it. He did it. That guy did it. Take him
[2213.43s -> 2229.43s]  back to his cell. Yeah. Come on, dude. Give it a rest. Oh, I'm about to impress everybody
[2230.07s -> 2249.03s]  at the prison right now. You ever seen anybody do that for your whole life? No. Oh yeah. No,
[2249.03s -> 2253.48s]  no, no. I mean, I heard you were coming. You're going to want to ship and I can get you one.
[2254.49s -> 2260.02s]  Check my bunk and you'll find one. It's yours. I want this guy fired for heaven.
[2260.82s -> 2264.82s]  Trying to do a voice like mine. I'm the only one that has a low gravelly voice.
[2264.82s -> 2272.68s]  Get rid of that guy. What do you want me to do? What's, what's with the links today? Dick ass
[2272.68s -> 2285.45s]  gameplay. Cool. Yeah. You cropped it. Listen, Riddick rust pulls all the strings in this block.
[2286.26s -> 2290.18s]  Personally, I don't much care for that. He's a thorn on my side.
[2292.12s -> 2297.29s]  Child humor. Remove the thorn, get rust. All right. So I have to,
[2298.82s -> 2311.46s]  you give me a list of people I have to. Wait, they electrocuted him and it electrocuted me.
[2313.67s -> 2322.28s]  I was standing on his body. I was a conductor. All right, let's go. Open it. Who did he say to
[2322.28s -> 2330.57s]  kill? Oh, and even listening. Yes, I was. Okay. Promise. Mattson promised he'd put a ship for you
[2330.57s -> 2337.69s]  in his bunk. Go to sell a 40 and get the ship. Don't give me a knife. Don't give me a knife.
[2337.69s -> 2340.97s]  Don't do that. I'll never get out of the tutorial. It's not going to happen. If you give it,
[2340.97s -> 2346.94s]  if I get a knife, I'm not going to be able to leave. Don't give me this in the toilet.
[2351.30s -> 2357.42s]  Hey, what? Oh, you guys want to fight. Do you, or is this like a dialogue thing?
[2358.06s -> 2366.25s]  No, what do you want to talk about? Uh, or I'll do it too. I'm new here and, uh,
[2366.25s -> 2396.42s]  I think they want to fight. Do they? I don't, maybe. Whoa, I just parried that guy. Okay. Okay.
[2400.38s -> 2403.26s]  Watch it. I'm going to flush him. I'm going to try to flush him.
[2418.01s -> 2421.51s]  He's too big. I can't flush him. All right. Where's the knife?
[2421.51s -> 2427.34s]  Supposed to be a knife in here. Oh no, he lied to me. There's no knife in here. He lied to me.
[2427.34s -> 2430.94s]  He said there was a knife in here. So I could come in and get beat up and potentially fucking
[2430.94s -> 2440.42s]  killed. Hmm. Mm hmm. Go see what he has to say about it. All right, let's go get him.
[2441.14s -> 2457.78s]  Where are you? Is that in the courtyard? Is there sprint? It's barber. That's Jimbo.
[2460.44s -> 2484.52s]  This is shabby. This is Michael's. Okay. Minus two joke, ignoring the link. I'm in the middle of
[2484.52s -> 2494.39s]  something. Where? No, not Jack. He's up here. He's the writer, isn't he? No, that's red.
[2497.35s -> 2507.03s]  Yeah. He let me explain. It was rust. He forced me to, but, but I knew those goons were no match
[2507.03s -> 2513.51s]  for you. I'll get you a shift. Just have things right. You have my word. I want it now. Cross me
[2513.51s -> 2521.22s]  again and I'll have your life. Talk. I don't know anything. Not compared to Haley. This one guy's
[2521.22s -> 2529.24s]  just like, I'm going to hear everything. Used to be a guard. Let me set things straight. I'll bring
[2529.24s -> 2533.80s]  that shift to your cell. Just kill. Just go there and wait. Are there three guys here? This?
[2536.15s -> 2540.63s]  Yeah. Yeah. That's what's happening. Haley. It's all right. I got, I'm still going to do the thing
[2540.63s -> 2547.48s]  for you. Get rust and I'll help you. Go to your cell and wait for me. That'd not be lying to me.
[2548.12s -> 2556.94s]  Remember this is the last time. All right. I was the last link of this link. Cool down is going
[2557.02s -> 2564.60s]  into effect. After I clicked this, it's just Homer Simpson, like shoes is Homer Simpson, like mask,
[2565.48s -> 2569.00s]  sock feet things. Right. And that like the kiosk at the mall, they have like goofy
[2569.00s -> 2581.70s]  fucking slippers to put on. That's cool. I'll go back to my cell, which cell is mine. I don't
[2581.70s -> 2585.86s]  even remember. I don't know which cell is mine. This is a bad prison. If I don't even know where
[2585.86s -> 2591.86s]  I go, I don't know what cell is mine. I forget eight 34. This one. All right. Where is he?
[2591.86s -> 2602.70s]  I got the ship you wanted. Really? What do you think you're doing? You deal in without my
[2602.70s -> 2613.13s]  approval. You're in my cell. You need a blade. You come to me. I said my cell. What wrong?
[2613.13s -> 2618.73s]  All these cells belong to the Achilles. Include this one. Now you ain't paid me for that shank.
[2618.73s -> 2626.76s]  So it ain't yours. Come take it. You got a hearing problem. I said everything I see belongs to me.
[2629.24s -> 2633.88s]  I see this. It belongs to me. Release him, British.
[2635.72s -> 2653.43s]  Who's this? And I will personally bring hell down on you. Oh, it's one of the guards. Let's do
[2653.43s -> 2657.75s]  something like Tony Hawk create a character outfit. I thought you were the big dog, Russ.
[2658.39s -> 2670.20s]  Maybe he's more yourself. Yes, sir. Mr. Rabbit. Hey, that's my friend. You are messing with the
[2670.20s -> 2675.16s]  natural order. What did he just do? Why did blood come out of him? Well, as you can see,
[2676.66s -> 2680.66s]  people can get that was a ketchup packet that he spread on the wall. This is actors. I'm telling
[2680.66s -> 2692.31s]  you. And we don't want that. Speak for yourself. This better not be one of your killing boys.
[2693.19s -> 2697.67s]  I've been here responding to not very good guard work. This is that we could have had like three
[2697.67s -> 2701.19s]  or four opportunities just to grab the gun out of his hand. Like, come on, you can't get that
[2701.19s -> 2718.63s]  close. All right. Get out of my get out of my wall. Get away from me.
[2723.30s -> 2728.82s]  Rust is waiting for you in the killers block. He won't stop till you're dead. So you better find
[2728.82s -> 2737.61s]  a weapon woman can help. Okay. I this is just go around and find the one person that's actually
[2737.61s -> 2746.70s]  going to help me. Okay. Get a weapon. I Haley won't talk to me unless I get rid of rust.
[2747.42s -> 2753.82s]  And then Molina seems to have messed up shabby up a real bad client and kill Molina. All right,
[2753.82s -> 2786.12s]  let's just go to the I need a weapon. Oh, wait, what if he doubles the money? I don't know what
[2786.12s -> 2792.28s]  you're after. Okay. But Haley knows how things work here. Check the courtyard. Now he didn't say
[2792.28s -> 2795.80s]  like, wait, I'll double the money that you were going to get from that guy. No, sorry. You didn't
[2795.80s -> 2814.98s]  do the double the money meme. How do I do this without getting attention trope cliche? Yeah,
[2814.98s -> 2874.86s]  whatever. That gallop can pick his body up. Hey, hit him one more time. I didn't want to do it in
[2874.86s -> 2884.41s]  the open. Wait, is he gonna remember that? He crawled out of myself. He crawled in that much
[2884.41s -> 2890.87s]  time to hear somebody get this guy some medicine. Wait, is he going to be there? He's not going to
[2890.87s -> 2895.91s]  still be here, right? Does he remember that I did that? Does this game have like memories? What?
[2902.95s -> 2909.80s]  He's dead? All right, where's um, where's the guy that I have to turn this into?
[2910.52s -> 2921.74s]  Who who wanted me to do this? Oh, it was shabby. Oh, now Molina is gone. Go and get your Oh,
[2921.74s -> 2936.65s]  all right. What's up? Thanks for wasting Molina. This is for you. What is it? What is it? You didn't
[2936.65s -> 2942.22s]  give me anything. What did it mean? This is for you. You didn't give me anything. Thanks for wasting
[2942.22s -> 2951.83s]  Molina man. See, wait, the unofficial and universal currency. You currently have five UD secret code.
[2952.89s -> 2957.05s]  This is a four digit security code. It opens a locked door somewhere probably inside the infirmary.
[2961.96s -> 2972.04s]  All right. Take care. Thanks, dude. All right, now let's go into the yard here. I'm gonna laugh my
[2972.04s -> 2980.04s]  ass off if in like 40 minutes this guy's up here on the ground still. Russ will kill you unless
[2980.04s -> 2996.36s]  you join him. I'd like to see him try Jimbo. I'd like to see him try a new fish in the tank.
[2997.53s -> 3006.49s]  How do you like it here? I don't. Name's red. Tell me. How did it feel when you killed your
[3006.49s -> 3011.61s]  first? Oh, you mean Molina? That's between me and him in butcher bay. You know, I did kind of was
[3011.61s -> 3020.89s]  some men can get very much pleasure. You know, there are worse reasons. Some like rust. I'd be
[3020.89s -> 3027.06s]  happy to see you go. Alright, so red wants rust gone. Rust wants Haley gone. Haley wants Molina
[3027.06s -> 3040.23s]  gone. Molina wants rust gone. This is like a long math problem. Unlike my SATs. Okay, rust is waiting
[3040.23s -> 3047.21s]  for you in Aquila territory. I don't have a weapon yet though. Haley won't talk unless you get rid
[3047.21s -> 3055.77s]  of rust. Where is he? Get rust. And I'll help. All right. Well, where is he? Which one is he?
[3055.85s -> 3064.02s]  That's booger. I'm watching you. Well, I punched him. I climbed this. Can I like grab onto this?
[3064.98s -> 3082.09s]  We're gonna go this way. Wow, man. Okay. Yeah, let's see if we can find somebody.
[3082.81s -> 3091.34s]  Oh, here we go. This is this is the territory. Wait, is it don't come here until I had a weapon?
[3091.34s -> 3107.19s]  All right. Yeah. Wait, I don't want to be here. Do I? You got two weapons lefty and righty.
[3109.75s -> 3122.22s]  All right, we're looking for wah man. Red, Haley, Jack.
[3124.86s -> 3130.25s]  He's waiting. Everyone just keeps tipping me off on this. Do you think this guy's just sitting there
[3130.25s -> 3133.93s]  with a knife just holding it standing around the alley and everyone has told me that he's going to
[3133.93s -> 3146.84s]  try to kill me? I think it's time for a new strategy. I killed him. So.
[3150.70s -> 3158.15s]  All right. No extra content. Large alien is now available in the extra content menu.
[3158.71s -> 3173.58s]  Take it easy. Wait, wait, wait. Is this a weapon? Knuckle duster. Okay, that's a weapon.
[3175.38s -> 3187.70s]  Thanks. All right, let's go. All right, we're gonna go. Rust is waiting for me. He's gonna kill me.
[3191.74s -> 3195.34s]  I know this now. I'm gonna go to this territory. I'm gonna find out what's going on over here.
[3206.66s -> 3212.89s]  Okay, let's get it. He's here.
[3217.85s -> 3235.85s]  Walk it. Walk it. There it is. All right, you let's go. Was that who? Which one of you is rust?
[3255.75s -> 3266.70s]  Smash his head in. Good. Was that money? Oh, I got two knuckle dusters and cigarettes.
[3267.70s -> 3274.47s]  The Riddick team unlocked. Cool. Is it a healing station?
[3274.47s -> 3286.60s]  That shit is dangerously close to the eyes. Wait, wait, wait. I probably should hide these guys,
[3286.60s -> 3312.86s]  right? Whatever. No, I wanted to. Okay. That was a little scary, but it didn't do anything.
[3317.99s -> 3321.82s]  Don't you think if you were this guy, you'd probably be like, oh shit, it didn't work.
[3321.82s -> 3331.50s]  It was supposed to explode, Riddick. I'm sorry. I want that knife. Walk it.
[3332.52s -> 3355.72s]  There we go. This is a mistake. Oh, this is green sludge on the ground. That's probably acid.
[3355.72s -> 3358.36s]  I'm gonna snap your head off and piss down your neck.
[3365.78s -> 3377.78s]  Oh shit. That was, I just like slashed him. I don't know how I stabbed him.
[3382.49s -> 3389.40s]  Oh, I thought I killed him. Damn it. I thought he died from that. Oh, you want to have an old
[3389.40s -> 3405.34s]  fashioned knife fight, do you? Come on. Oh, sorry about that. Can I have two knives? Oh no.
[3405.34s -> 3425.32s]  This one's cooler. I wish you could do a weld. Somebody there. Wait, I know this guy. This guy
[3425.32s -> 3450.23s]  was in a cut scene. I can't believe that worked. Where is the principal? Where's the guard?
[3453.74s -> 3459.29s]  I'm dead. Where's the warden? Where's the warden?
[3466.63s -> 3487.83s]  Get ready to die. Come on, do it. I'm trying to parry him. I'm trying. It's harder than he thinks.
[3488.55s -> 3506.49s]  Get away from me. I cannot parry this guy. I don't think I can parry him. Where's he? Where is he?
[3511.08s -> 3515.24s]  You can't parry him. He's a boss fight. Oh, well then I'll just kill him.
[3520.46s -> 3547.11s]  Get ready. So fucking glad I'm not playing this on hard. Where you going? What's he doing?
[3547.11s -> 3591.45s]  Switching it up. I'm in my menu and he knows he's coming at me. He's so good. Why is he so good?
[3594.76s -> 3605.85s]  Why do I only have one stab? Just spam. He's going to kill me. Why do I only have this one
[3605.85s -> 3610.17s]  like lunging stab? All right, I'm just going to fucking spam. All right, I'll do it. Fine.
[3610.89s -> 3660.70s]  It's taking so long. So this is the beast of Butchabay, huh? Head of the killing gang.
[3663.69s -> 3666.65s]  Hey, just out of curiosity, Riddick, how many tries did that take you?
[3668.02s -> 3674.02s]  Looks like I need a new rooster. Let's say four. They respect you now, Riddick. I can make things
[3674.02s -> 3685.50s]  easier. Say something and take that as a no. Saying no to me is not the kind of mistake you
[3685.50s -> 3693.03s]  want to make. Oh, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's going on right now? Am I supposed to be
[3693.03s -> 3703.14s]  hiding from these? But they have laser eyes. I don't know what we do. By the way,
[3703.14s -> 3727.85s]  this is my kill. I wish you could throw. Shit, he fucking looked at me. I was trying to break
[3727.85s -> 3735.11s]  his neck and run. I hate when games give me freedom because I can die. I just don't stop.
[3736.31s -> 3749.22s]  All right, I'm just leaving. Fine. Here we go. Goodbye. Hey, what? Oh, stay the fuck away from
[3749.22s -> 3778.60s]  me. He gave me cigarettes. Am I a bad guy now? Do people think I'm bad? Okay, where do I go?
[3784.25s -> 3786.41s]  Rust is gone. You should go talk to Haley. Okay.
[3798.34s -> 3817.51s]  Dude, I think you got him. Oh, shit. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh,
[3817.51s -> 3830.02s]  no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. I gotta go. That was something, man.
[3830.02s -> 3840.97s]  Hey, thanks. No, don't break everybody's neck. I need NPCs. It's gonna be like Dark Souls where
[3840.97s -> 3851.19s]  if you kill all the NPCs, like the game sucks. I'm done. Get the gun. I can't get the gun. The guy
[3851.19s -> 3868.49s]  electrocuted my... It said unauthorized access. I can't get the gun. It's locked. Break this guy's
[3868.49s -> 3888.73s]  neck. No, I can't kill everybody. I'm sorry. I can't. I didn't do that. Right? I didn't do that.
[3888.73s -> 3900.66s]  You did. I did not do that. He forgot. He blacked out and did it. All right. Where's my reward?
[3901.83s -> 3911.40s]  Where are you? Hey. I heard you rejected Abbott. That's integrity. So I'll keep my word. What do
[3911.40s -> 3921.30s]  you want to know about? Pit. Looks like a way out. Way out? Sure. Raise some hell. Raise some hell and
[3921.30s -> 3927.88s]  they throw you down. If you manage to stay alive, there's supposed to be a way into Pigsville from
[3927.88s -> 3936.36s]  down there. But it's never been done. I like a challenge. Well, then Pigsville's your place.
[3936.60s -> 3940.52s]  The space board hangers. This looks like space, doesn't it?
[3949.46s -> 3951.06s]  Because that's why I've been dying. Okay.
[3966.90s -> 3971.62s]  If you want to get through the infirmary gates, there's this hack names Boulder.
[3972.18s -> 3987.26s]  He owes me 150. Talk to him. What about you? No, I almost did it. All right. Talk to Boulder to get
[3987.26s -> 3997.74s]  into the infirmary. I have to start to remember names. Boulder. It was booger. Where's Boulder?
[4006.20s -> 4017.69s]  Boulder. I don't know where I can find Boulder. Do the Vin Diesel voice. Funny man. You must
[4017.69s -> 4027.62s]  have just, I've done it like five times. Fine. That's Snape. Let me change it. I can't do it
[4027.62s -> 4035.14s]  anymore. It's Snape again. I can't do it. It's always going to be Snape. I have to delete that
[4035.14s -> 4042.10s]  from my mind. No, it's I will see you in an hour. Just stay for an hour. You'll figure it out.
[4057.05s -> 4064.49s]  I can't. All right. Where's Boulder? Hey, Haley says you owe him. You should get that money from
[4064.49s -> 4068.73s]  you. Riddick. You screwed my bet on rush when you figure it out. Yeah. I don't know what that
[4068.73s -> 4076.49s]  means yourself, but betting against me now. It looks like a thumb and you look like how I
[4076.49s -> 4099.50s]  feel like shit. Okay. Go on through. Hurry up. Thanks dude. Appreciate it. Open. All right. Now
[4099.50s -> 4104.62s]  what do I have to go? I have to find a necklace that's going to give me powers. What do I do?
[4105.26s -> 4116.10s]  I don't, I'm not going to do it. What's going on in here? Uh-oh. Just wait here for the doctor.
[4116.10s -> 4122.54s]  Don't you fucking dare move. That sounds like a guy that never gets to say swears in his
[4122.54s -> 4133.11s]  parents' house. Hey, I'm still, I'm waiting for the doctor. What the fuck is wrong with you?
[4134.26s -> 4140.36s]  For all you know, I could be the doctor. Okay. Get out of here. What's going on with this guy?
[4140.84s -> 4162.14s]  Stomach cramps. Take care of that. Jesus Christ. He just lit that guy up. He lit that guy up. All
[4162.14s -> 4171.62s]  right. I feel bad now. I feel bad now. That guy ate all the bullets. I feel terrible. That guy
[4171.62s -> 4179.35s]  inhaled all of them. Okay. Hey, just wait here for the doctor. Don't you fucking dare move.
[4179.91s -> 4188.89s]  Okay. I have to, I have to address this. Somebody went snap fingers, snap fingers. Hey, funny guy,
[4188.89s -> 4215.46s]  do the funny voices like, get out of here. No, where's this doctor? Don't come over here. You
[4215.46s -> 4238.17s]  saw me do that, but I, you're, wait, what? I have the code. I think the door came down and crushed
[4238.17s -> 4246.34s]  me. Just wait here for the doctor. Don't you fucking. All right. I need to obviously distract
[4246.34s -> 4250.10s]  them somehow. The doctor's never coming. Or am I just so impatient that I can't do this?
[4250.74s -> 4263.14s]  What does, what does the doctor look like? Well, this guy, this guy doesn't have a gun.
[4263.14s -> 4268.97s]  Is this the doctor? All right. Don't break the doctor's neck when he opens the door. Don't
[4268.97s -> 4271.77s]  break the doctor's neck when he opens the door. Don't break the doctor's neck when he opens the
[4271.77s -> 4317.70s]  door. He's going to write it on the chalkboard a thousand times. I mean, this is dark. I'm in the
[4317.70s -> 4334.01s]  dark. He can't see anything. What's going on? What is happening? I think that guy's stuck in the door.
[4334.01s -> 4384.38s]  Okay. All right. Now you can't pick these up. Oh damn. Security code. Put them down. Put them
[4384.38s -> 4414.36s]  down. Put them down. All right. I got the security code. That means I can leave. Got it. What?
[4415.62s -> 4440.58s]  What are you just standing there? Die. Die. Oh, you have a code on you. That was the doctor. I see.
[4440.58s -> 4457.70s]  Okay. What's in here? Some type of weird laboratory machine. I use it. Use health station. Oh,
[4459.14s -> 4462.42s]  this looks like that thing at Dave and Buster's that you ride the roller coaster.
[4465.14s -> 4470.73s]  Why is that still in Dave and Buster's by the way? That shit was really, really interesting.
[4470.73s -> 4475.53s]  Probably 15 years ago that like that was this VR. Now you don't have to watch like a TV screen
[4475.53s -> 4492.86s]  while your seat moves. I don't even need the help. I should be sneaking around way more often. Can
[4492.86s -> 4498.18s]  I pick this up? This looks like an exploding barrel. He's going to turn the corner and shoot
[4498.18s -> 4508.52s]  the exploding barrel. Isn't it? And now I'm up top. All right. So is there anybody up here?
[4511.54s -> 4532.36s]  Oh, oh shit. Okay. Wait for him to walk by permanent health upgrade. Are you serious?
[4532.92s -> 4562.98s]  How do I use it? Oh, all right. Do I want to pick skiing roller coaster or I'm in an airplane?
[4565.06s -> 4587.35s]  That was all right. You're way too close. You're too close. Yeah. Don't do that again.
[4587.35s -> 4601.88s]  Don't do that again or you're going to be real sorry. All right. This is a safe point. So I can
[4601.88s -> 4609.56s]  doesn't matter service hatch, but wait. Oh, done. Done. I can't pick up the gun. The DNA.
[4609.56s -> 4619.69s]  Look, look guys. Look, ready? Look, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I cannot pick up the
[4619.69s -> 4638.65s]  gun. I don't have the DNA qualification, whatever the hell it is. Look, look at, look, stay. I love
[4638.65s -> 4662.01s]  it. Is he going to climb in the hatch? Are they looking for me? Like, can I just jump on people?
[4664.50s -> 4696.60s]  Where is this guy? All right. Keep going. Right. Going on. All right. Give me up there. I'm going
[4700.57s -> 4723.56s]  right, right, right. Going on, I guess. Hey, I'm just didn't even. Oh, I'll smart it again.
[4733.35s -> 4736.15s]  Oh, that's me. That's my cue, right? That's where I want to go.
[4737.11s -> 4771.72s]  Security code. Wait, I dump them down there. No. Okay. Well, I can stand up now. Where's the key
[4771.72s -> 4789.02s]  code? Grab the gun. You can't get the gun. There's no gun. Um, and who's killed me?
[4790.06s -> 4811.03s]  Got to stay in the dark. Security code. All right. I think somebody walked by. We'll wait for them.
[4811.75s -> 4831.48s]  Where is he? All right. Now, wait, no, no. Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
[4832.89s -> 4839.53s]  Somebody comes from the other angle. Yep. Who's that? Somebody's pointing at me. Wait,
[4840.17s -> 4854.38s]  that's a spotlight. It's on me. All right. This guy have tranquilizer darts. I'm dead again
[4854.38s -> 4864.36s]  instantly. All right. You know what? Fuck it. Got to stay in the dark. No, I get it. This is a
[4864.36s -> 4873.45s]  stealth part of the mission where you can, you instantly die. I get it. I stay in the dark.
[4873.45s -> 4892.82s]  Why did he turn around? What? Okay. Can, does the spotlight move? Why is the spotlight move?
[4892.82s -> 4925.38s]  It just stays right there. All right. But eat, eat what? I don't have anything to eat.
[4925.38s -> 4948.04s]  I'm going to eat. I made it. I'm good. Eat a McDLT. I would right now. The main frame.
[4949.14s -> 4961.18s]  Security will be tight. Sure. Like a challenge. That's the kind of voice that you use when it's
[4961.18s -> 4965.77s]  like one o'clock in the morning and you're talking to like a significant other or like,
[4965.77s -> 4970.25s]  you know, a person of interest. Like we get laid at night and you just like talking like that.
[4970.25s -> 4976.25s]  Like what's up? Yeah. Just hanging out. Just chilling. I don't know why we people do that.
[4976.25s -> 4981.61s]  It's just, it's just sound like sexy. I don't, I don't know what it means. Why do we do that?
[4982.25s -> 4987.82s]  Like I very clearly could just put my head up and be like, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4987.82s -> 5000.23s]  I don't think I'm supposed to be down here. How does this guy happen? Give me the DNA sample.
[5002.63s -> 5012.36s]  Wait, he didn't have it on him. What was this random engineer with like a staff?
[5013.48s -> 5025.80s]  Oh, give me that. I want your staff. Hold on. I can use guns now. Oh yeah, they do.
[5038.79s -> 5054.42s]  I never had any gun training in my life. I lost the CQC training though. God. I'm so stupid.
[5062.76s -> 5067.42s]  Now things get interesting. All right. Well, I didn't know they were going to pour in here.
[5069.88s -> 5094.94s]  All right. Bring it on. Okay. Give me all the ammo. How do I reload the gun?
[5097.51s -> 5134.71s]  Wait, gun. Oh, cool. I got gun. Gun. What? Oh, I'm dead. Didn't come in. What are they? Oh,
[5134.71s -> 5155.24s]  that's, it's supposed to blow up a wall. Oh, health station. Debris. Oh, was he going to burn me?
[5159.51s -> 5173.13s]  I can't even see me down here, dude. You can't. He didn't see me down there. That's ridiculous.
[5173.13s -> 5176.97s]  You get a key code on it. Shotgun. Better. I'll take the shotgun over anything else.
[5176.97s -> 5188.74s]  My favorite weapon. Wait, was this a, oh, I thought this was a vent to go into.
[5189.46s -> 5193.38s]  Do I have to destroy this? I'm like trying to crawl in it. What do I have to do with this?
[5209.14s -> 5232.81s]  Did I miss something? Oh, use the screwdriver. I'm just going to climb. I guess. Yeah. Okay. Climb.
[5233.53s -> 5236.54s]  I just said open service panel. I didn't know what it was supposed to mean.
[5238.68s -> 5246.46s]  Oh, Cindy's. I'll get it back up there. Wait, I might be able to jump on top of people. This
[5246.46s -> 5258.38s]  might be fun to go that way. But wait, can I jump on somebody's head? No. All right. We're
[5258.38s -> 5273.30s]  going to just go from here to there. Who's taking a look? Hmm. Nothing here. Oh, he's right there.
[5273.30s -> 5285.38s]  Okay. Headshot. No, I can't see in here. Keep looking. Don't even, don't even do it. Just go.
[5286.02s -> 5292.18s]  Wait, it's my opportunity. I noticed something. I want to check who's there.
[5295.14s -> 5299.06s]  This is my opportunity to do it. Yeah, not here, but I know he's around.
[5299.22s -> 5313.32s]  Hmm. What? Why didn't that work? Didn't it say you could jump on people's heads?
[5316.78s -> 5341.62s]  I feel like I was lied to. Turn back. How do you have, there's no fucking way you have more
[5341.62s -> 5353.27s]  reaction time than me on that one. Wait, I get to try this again.
[5368.73s -> 5374.07s]  Melee weapon. All right. Walk down here. Come on, man. Let's go.
[5380.84s -> 5391.86s]  And I heard something. Go walk over here. Both of you idiots. He's being body blocked. He wants
[5391.86s -> 5398.26s]  going on here. He's so badly wants to go home. He desperately wants to keep looking, but this guy
[5398.26s -> 5404.18s]  keeps getting in his way. Just let him do an investigation. Someone's here. I didn't mean to
[5404.18s -> 5426.89s]  jump through. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm dead. God damn it. Well, they wouldn't walk.
[5426.89s -> 5435.64s]  They couldn't get the guy to move. All right. There's a heel right there. Just got to kill this
[5435.64s -> 5450.57s]  guy. One, two. What? I hear another guy shooting. I'm going to have to prefire. Where is he? Oh,
[5450.57s -> 5454.57s]  did I get him? I don't know. Did I get him? I still hear the Metal Gear Solid music.
[5459.50s -> 5479.59s]  He's up. I don't know. Where is he? I don't know where he is. He's right. Okay. I see him,
[5479.59s -> 5499.13s]  but how the fuck am I going to aim over there? I have an idea. How are they seeing me? What?
[5501.32s -> 5519.10s]  Where am I? Where? He should have been through the, he tried to shoot me through the grate.
[5519.10s -> 5523.37s]  He's trying to shoot me through the grate. I got to take it fast. What would, what would Riddick do?
[5524.17s -> 5544.58s]  What a shitty movie. This is how I used to play paintball when I was a kid. I was so scared. I
[5544.58s -> 5549.46s]  didn't want to have so badly. Didn't want to get hit at the whole game. I would just stay in one
[5549.46s -> 5566.71s]  spot and just kind of peek out and go and then just immediately get back in. Am I dead? Okay.
[5566.71s -> 5594.26s]  You can connect again, please. Thank you. Okay. I can't shoot him through the grate, but he can
[5594.26s -> 5603.38s]  shoot me through the grate. I'm done with this bullshit. I'm just fucking lighten up. I'm just
[5603.38s -> 5620.60s]  lighten them up. You know what I mean? I fell through the grate. Come on, let's go. Get it.
[5620.60s -> 5639.48s]  Show it. Go on. Go on. Dude, I'm supposed to be able to see in the dark. Okay. But how's this,
[5639.48s -> 5660.31s]  does it make any sense? Riddick's supposed to be able to see in the dark. Not yet. Who said that?
[5660.31s -> 5665.94s]  That guy was blending into the environment. That guy was actually not a person. He was like a wall.
[5675.37s -> 5713.46s]  Uh oh. Gas. That was easy. Did you do that for fun or I don't... Okay. Wait, there's a little more gas
[5713.46s -> 5727.18s]  over here. This is not open. Can I... I can't go that way. Oh, is there a way to make the wall
[5727.18s -> 5767.98s]  explode? I get it. D-pad? No. I gotta get... I have to go down. I have eight bullets. What? Where did
[5767.98s -> 5788.02s]  that guy go? Give me a checkpoint. Can we go back to like punching inmates and like laughing at
[5788.02s -> 5822.55s]  toilets? All right. This looks like a boss area. All right. I'm gonna use gun. Okay. Thanks. Oh,
[5822.55s -> 5828.07s]  nice dodging. Oh, why am I the boss? You know what I mean? Like that's how you would dodge the boss.
[5828.07s -> 5849.69s]  I'm the boss and he just, he's the one that's playing the game. Why did he explode? Can I leave?
[5850.25s -> 5862.46s]  Hello? Everybody gone? Oh, shit. This one guy. Oh my god. He's right here. Oh my god. He's gonna
[5862.46s -> 5877.46s]  hit me once. I'm gonna die. Where are you? Where? There's another guy. Where's the other guy?
[5877.46s -> 5907.62s]  There's a... There's another guy? Oh, no. It's the space marine. This is so lame.
[5908.50s -> 5936.02s]  Hold on. Wait. Let me reload. Why am I holding the gun like this? Oh, come on. I have to shoot him in
[5936.02s -> 5948.34s]  the back? Oh. I have to get in a spot. There's the grenade. All right. I'm going over here.
[5948.34s -> 5972.94s]  I'm already almost dead. Give me the... Oh, I got him in the head. Okay. I got him.
[5973.58s -> 5989.88s]  Stand still for a second. All right. Nice. Now, is there a... Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. Wait, wait,
[5989.88s -> 5996.94s]  wait. Is that... Can I get the health back? He goes, hey. Oh, no. Where do I hide? I'm gonna
[5996.94s -> 6014.33s]  hide over here. Do I hide over here? Am I technically in the dark? I'm in the dark
[6014.33s -> 6030.87s]  right now. Okay. He can't see me. He's getting... Is he getting closer or further away? Destroy the
[6030.87s -> 6063.50s]  lights? Oh, shit. Where... Oh, there he is. He can't see me, right? I'm invisible. I thought I was
[6063.50s -> 6083.43s]  invisible, man. Just anything. I got him. Holy shit. He's so easy. Oh, you just have to shoot
[6083.43s -> 6090.92s]  him in the back once. Oh, okay. I think he's still in there. That would not have killed him. I think
[6090.92s -> 6100.62s]  he's still in there. I think he's... Can I drag the body? I need a heal thing. Check the bodies.
[6101.02s -> 6118.68s]  Get weapons. Get ammo. Set that thing up because it's annoying. Oh, you can. All right. I got ammo.
[6120.20s -> 6149.46s]  Good. Let's go. Lights off. Isn't there still a riot going on? Yeah, I can hear it. Hey, Xbox off.
[6149.46s -> 6154.82s]  It's not an Xbox one. They weren't smart enough back then. Special task forces are now entering
[6154.82s -> 6167.46s]  the cell block. Stay low and do not move. What did that say? What did that say? I had like a prompt.
[6167.46s -> 6205.61s]  What was it? You guys saw that, right? Why am I turning on? What did I do? All right. Let's go.
[6207.05s -> 6228.81s]  All right. There's some... Okay. Switching turret settings from tranquilizing to lethal.
[6230.01s -> 6245.48s]  Oh, that's a turret shooting at me. Where is it? That's just a big bright light. I don't even know
[6245.48s -> 6274.06s]  where it is. Is that a turret? There was a guy hiding in the shadows, too. I'm telling you,
[6274.14s -> 6279.18s]  more and more every day, I feel like an NPC playing the game with the protagonist fighting me.
[6279.90s -> 6282.63s]  Yeah. Turn this on. I don't know if this does, but it does something.
[6283.27s -> 6310.09s]  Let your big brother help you. No. I want to play. Switching turret settings from tranquilizing to
[6310.09s -> 6328.60s]  lethal. Turret down. Where's another turret? Is that a turret right there? Yep. Turn off the light.
[6328.60s -> 6337.45s]  Where's the guy that's here? Oh, he's dead. All right. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead.
[6338.09s -> 6345.45s]  Where am I supposed to be going? Turn off all the lights. I need them, though,
[6345.45s -> 6352.52s]  because I can't see shit either. I'm just making the game harder for myself. I can't see in the
[6352.52s -> 6391.32s]  dark. Is that a good guy? That's a turret! Whoa. Who's who? Take your sunglasses off.
[6397.05s -> 6419.30s]  Hello? Holy shit. It's behind me. What? Where is it? Is that it? I'm so confused. I was
[6419.30s -> 6475.22s]  getting shot from behind. That's a shadow. Fuck. I got him. I need tape. Where is it?
[6480.97s -> 6492.15s]  Where? I don't know where it is. Why is it super dark now? What happened? Where the fuck am I?
[6493.11s -> 6506.02s]  Did I turn off the lights on my stream? Who is it? I don't understand what's going on.
[6506.02s -> 6513.19s]  How did I get over here? Wasn't somebody over here? It was a guy here. Where's my gun? What
[6513.19s -> 6542.46s]  happened? Did I do it? Oh, shit. Get that light off. Get this light off. Turn that light off. Oh,
[6542.46s -> 6566.10s]  wait. That's outside. You can't do that. Turn this one off. Who's the fucking turret? Of course it
[6566.10s -> 6575.94s]  was. Of course it was. All right. Did I get the heal? I have the heal. All right. Let's go. Wait.
[6575.94s -> 6588.65s]  Turn the valve. I still don't even know what this does. I don't instantly lose three bars.
[6590.78s -> 6591.90s]  I didn't do anything.
[6614.52s -> 6649.82s]  Oh, it's dead. Okay. I got full health. Good. Fuck you. Okay. I got it. Look at my health,
[6649.82s -> 6660.28s]  man. Oh my God. You guys are already playing on hard. No. I shot that guy like four times.
[6660.28s -> 6679.61s]  I still can't figure out what's happening to that guy.
[6680.57s -> 6685.74s]  Switching turret settings from tranquilizing to lethal.
[6685.74s -> 6710.66s]  This dude just explodes. Where is it? Right here? Oh, I got it. Good job. All right. Don't let this
[6710.66s -> 6743.35s]  guy kill me. He doesn't even know where I am. Holy shit. Wait. That's a speaker. It's over here.
[6743.35s -> 6763.56s]  Oh, why did I just panic? All right. I don't want to visit. Where's the turret? I know there's one
[6763.56s -> 6774.98s]  over here somewhere. Isn't there? Wait. There's a guy. All right. Hold on. Wait for the guy. Wait.
[6774.98s -> 6784.01s]  It's an explosive. Is that an explosive? It's not an explosive. Shit. I thought it was a barrel.
[6785.80s -> 6800.94s]  Those bullets came from behind me. Why? Where is that? They hit something behind me.
[6806.34s -> 6826.02s]  It ricocheted. Oh, dude. Fuck this. Okay. Good. Where is it? Is that it? Yep. Okay. There's another
[6826.02s -> 6845.19s]  one. That's not it. All right. I'm going to get the safety of the bathroom. I wish there was a
[6845.19s -> 6848.71s]  heal in the bathroom. I don't know what that is, but I'm going to take it. What is that?
[6850.68s -> 6886.07s]  Nanomed cartridge. Did I not even? You can't be fucked. How is it still hitting me? Oh, God damn
[6886.07s -> 6913.56s]  it. I'm just using the light. I don't care. I can't see anything. I'm using the light. It makes it
[6913.56s -> 6919.88s]  worse. Nevermind. Oh shit. He's coming down the hall. He's coming down the hall. He's coming down
[6919.88s -> 6937.35s]  the hall. Where is it? He's coming down the hall. Just wait for him. Why is this guy can see me?
[6948.25s -> 6953.56s]  That just actually hurt my chest. That just scared the shit out of me. Go back and heal. Oh,
[6960.04s -> 6964.04s]  all right. I'm going. I'm just fucking going fast. I know where they are. I'm
[6980.49s -> 6983.21s]  switching turret settings from tranquilizing to lethal.
[6986.01s -> 7012.42s]  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yep. Okay. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. Okay. I'm not. Let's go.
[7013.22s -> 7032.25s]  Where is it? What do I hear? Like a ticking sound. The turret on my right. Oh, thank you.
[7040.81s -> 7058.81s]  The game has an auto. I can turn the auto aim off. That's the problem. Where is it? Where is it?
[7058.81s -> 7102.50s]  Where is it? Okay. Now go heal. Where is she? All right. I feel more calm. Did I get a permanent
[7102.50s -> 7121.61s]  health upgrade? Where'd it go? I don't have a permanent health upgrade. Oh, it only had one
[7121.61s -> 7124.89s]  charge. Okay. All right. Not going to let this guy kill me this time. Not going to blow it.
[7126.09s -> 7139.67s]  He's just waiting. I didn't get him in the head. All right. Hold on. He's dead. But now is I think
[7139.67s -> 7173.82s]  a turret over here. All right. Let's fucking go. Con the hacks into opening it. What? Who's the
[7173.82s -> 7189.32s]  hacks? Are you a hack? I think I needed that guy. Are you alive? Get up. Do you have a thing on you?
[7189.96s -> 7196.07s]  Does that guy have a thing on him? I need you to come with me and open this door over here.
[7199.83s -> 7228.17s]  My one hacker. You. This is so hard to control. Where's the other one? He's right over there.
[7228.17s -> 7241.13s]  Come on. Where? I need a hacker. Hacker. Wait, he just opened the door. Holy shit. He opened the
[7241.13s -> 7290.76s]  door. I got in. All right. Now that door is open or something, right? God damn it. Give me a
[7290.76s -> 7324.92s]  checkpoint. I couldn't. I tried. Okay. I got you. Checkpoint. Checkpoint. Yes. What?
[7327.48s -> 7341.24s]  I would love it if the credits just rolled. It was a slow close up to Vin Diesel's face. His eyes
[7341.24s -> 7358.39s]  are wide open and he's just fucking dead. I do have an, would that actually work?
[7359.19s -> 7365.74s]  If there was a person underneath you and you fell and you landed right on them, would they die?
[7366.70s -> 7372.28s]  Okay. What if it was like five people? I'm talking like you have one, two, three, four, five,
[7372.28s -> 7377.03s]  and you're like, you're like the sixth person. Still no.
[7384.55s -> 7408.07s]  This is a timed mission. What is it? Gollum? What was that? Oh shit. Oh my God. It really is.
[7416.73s -> 7424.46s]  Oh my goodness. This just turned into a completely different video game in the last 30 seconds.
[7427.40s -> 7443.18s]  I feel like I'm playing killing floor. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Oh no.
[7444.54s -> 7471.98s]  Okay. What do I, I don't know what the goal is. Open this door. Why don't bullets work anymore
[7471.98s -> 7488.28s]  on these explosive barrels? Okay. I think it's scripted. It's not actually five minutes.
[7501.38s -> 7520.82s]  See, we're good. We're good. Don't waste ammo. Yeah. You're right. Make way for the messenger.
[7524.84s -> 7539.82s]  Justice and vengeance. Is this guy talking? Wait, was there a guy over here?
[7556.79s -> 7587.90s]  I don't know. I don't even know where to go. I think I got it. Did I get it? This looks new.
[7587.90s -> 7618.12s]  I think this is new. This is new. No, wait, which are you kidding me? This estimated time to failure,
[7618.12s -> 7643.67s]  two minutes. Get away from me. I found it. I found it. I found it. Oh my God. I have no,
[7643.67s -> 7654.22s]  where am I supposed to go? Was I not supposed to go down? Keep turning left. You will get there.
[7662.01s -> 7680.20s]  That's going to put me in a circle. There was a find the exit from the pit. Estimated time to
[7680.20s -> 7687.53s]  failure. Well, this is not good. Okay. So if this goes over here, I can go up, but that just leads
[7687.53s -> 7694.23s]  me back up anyways, right? Or should I go this way? Is it broken? No, that just leads me back up.
[7694.87s -> 7701.85s]  Wasn't somebody was just talking to me over here? Is there more than one ways to go?
[7702.65s -> 7714.31s]  There was a guy over here that was talking. Okay. Right here. So what's going on here? Can I jump
[7714.31s -> 7738.01s]  up? Can I like blast through this? Can I open this? The hole. Okay. I'm sorry, but no, no, no,
[7738.49s -> 7747.94s]  no, no. You're talking about this hole right here. This hole here. That's not, I don't fit through
[7747.94s -> 7764.25s]  there. I already bullets. I can't fit through this hole. You have to squeeze through. I definitely
[7764.25s -> 7790.65s]  cannot make it through there. There's a way up through the top. Is there? I don't see anything.
[7791.21s -> 7802.09s]  It's the longest one minute I think I've ever seen. Stop going down here in the first place.
[7802.09s -> 7830.52s]  Explore the first floor. I don't even have a flashlight. Okay. This is the first floor.
[7839.58s -> 7849.72s]  Please play. I have no idea what it felt. I have to jump up on one of like the banisters.
[7849.72s -> 7866.36s]  Okay. I found it. I went every single place, but here it's come on. Give me a break. I don't have
[7866.36s -> 7880.07s]  any bullets. I'm sorry. This is, I'm, I'm in a lot of trouble. Leave us be sinners. This lamb is
[7880.07s -> 7892.30s]  special. You need fighting. I'm fighting somebody in the dark. The lights could turn on. This could
[7892.30s -> 7907.24s]  end up being like a little kid. I can't, maybe it'll reload me with actual bullets and shit.
[7908.04s -> 7913.62s]  Yeah. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.
[7915.06s -> 7923.06s]  I know where to go. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Uh huh. Uh huh. Sure. Sure. Sure.
[7923.22s -> 7927.94s]  Give me the lore. Give me the story. I don't, I don't care about any of that. I just want to,
[7927.94s -> 7948.42s]  hold on. It's over here. It's over here. Hey, you open that up. Make way for the messenger.
[7949.06s -> 7963.66s]  I am the light, justice and vengeance of the universe. Okay. At least I have two bullets.
[7963.66s -> 7973.64s]  I have 50. Nevermind. I'm good to go. Okay. Good. We, we've done it. Leave us be sinners.
[7974.65s -> 7984.38s]  This lamb is special. That's not explosive. Five minutes. All right. What does he want?
[7987.67s -> 8015.08s]  Wait, did he just do the suicide squad Joker? You know, he is, he's going, ah, ah, ah.
[8015.08s -> 8027.66s]  Yeah. Aim better. You won't survive long dripping blood. The dwellers will
[8028.46s -> 8047.82s]  smell. He told me, he told me you would come. Come. We must travel up here. I live above.
[8048.46s -> 8063.11s]  Am I still crouching? No. You need that gaze that shows right from wrong and reveals the door.
[8063.51s -> 8088.31s]  Oh, what's this? Flares. What can you do with a flare? He spoke to me,
[8088.31s -> 8099.72s]  but how do I know you're not a simple imposter? Can you stitch me or not? Yes. Yes. But first,
[8100.52s -> 8107.26s]  get me back my blessing. Boys box, a dangerous task made more so by the dwellers.
[8107.98s -> 8116.42s]  It would prove that you are what he told me. I don't the boss box and I would tend to your wounds.
[8117.14s -> 8122.90s]  The flails in that box will provide the light you need. God, not another one of these.
[8125.67s -> 8132.22s]  How many do I have? How do they work? And they do anything special.
[8163.78s -> 8169.03s]  They don't last very long. I can get more than seven. How many can I have?
[8169.03s -> 8192.02s]  Oh, okay. Get my blessing. I think I ended up with a broken elbow after that one.
[8192.02s -> 8199.26s]  All right, let's go. You cured my, you cured my hangover, but you gave me a broken arm.
[8199.26s -> 8222.82s]  All right. You want us to leave lights, press the light button. I can't turn my flashlight off.
[8222.82s -> 8232.73s]  All right. So what does he want me to do? Pope Joe's seems to be able to help you. If you can
[8232.73s -> 8255.06s]  find his blessed voice box. Do we have to go down? It's a radio. All right. So I have 12
[8255.06s -> 8278.33s]  flares. So what the hell am I supposed to do? Oh, find his voice box. Just find it. Okay.
[8279.29s -> 8290.17s]  I'm gonna see if I can find it. This is what the flares are for. God damn it.
[8290.81s -> 8296.58s]  You know how awesome this game must have been to develop. Imagine being a game designer and a world
[8296.58s -> 8304.09s]  designer and you only have to make a walkway right here. Nothing else matters. Everything
[8304.09s -> 8310.25s]  else doesn't need to be rendered. You could hide so much shit in the darkness. Speaking of the
[8310.25s -> 8336.98s]  darkness. Somebody somebody right in front of me. Okay. I picked them back up. No. Shit. How many
[8336.98s -> 8351.58s]  people are in front of me? All right. I know there's a door there. Got it. Where is it? I can hear it.
[8353.69s -> 8380.41s]  I hear this damn thing. Thank you. Let's go out. What is this guy gonna help me do? Um,
[8381.05s -> 8412.54s]  shit. I don't know. I don't. Where's the exit? All right. Let's go. This is gonna he's gonna
[8412.54s -> 8416.54s]  give me night vision. Wait, is he gonna give me the thing that I can actually see in the dark?
[8417.10s -> 8436.78s]  That would be awesome. Here you go. Bring all blessings ready. Have everything prepared inside.
[8437.74s -> 8438.82s]  Nice.
[8494.68s -> 8502.10s]  Somebody got it. Thanks. Why am I thanking you for getting a reference to a game
[8502.18s -> 8520.10s]  here? Do not trust all that you see. At least not yet. Your destiny lies elsewhere. I really feel
[8520.10s -> 8523.94s]  like the only way you can talk like this is seriously if you lie down in bed with your chin
[8523.94s -> 8529.86s]  down, you have to have just woken up. You have to just open your eyes and put the bike in front of
[8529.86s -> 8573.93s]  you. I sound like this sometimes in the morning. So wait, I'm now it's very bright and I can see in
[8573.93s -> 8590.34s]  the dark. Now I can't look at lights. I only said auto voice. With your new shined eyes,
[8590.34s -> 8598.63s]  you can see in the dark. Press up to toggle night vision on and off. That's not very good.
[8599.91s -> 8610.30s]  Uh, why don't I just get night vision goggles? I wouldn't have to completely ruin my body and
[8610.30s -> 8613.58s]  have a weird surgery and shit. Just put on night vision goggles. They're better than this.
[8614.14s -> 8631.59s]  What year does this take place? Night vision goggles have to exist, right? This is 2020,
[8631.67s -> 8637.90s]  2020, 2203. It's going to be a real pain in the ass once we go up 100.
[8639.64s -> 8650.12s]  Like how do you say to like, okay, the year 2106, 2106, 2106, 216. So how do you,
[8650.12s -> 8665.22s]  how are you going to say that? Yeah, once it gets to like 200, like 2645, 2645. Yeah, I guess it's
[8665.22s -> 8678.15s]  not that hard. I really don't like this. This just reminds me of putting on 3d glasses and looking at
[8678.15s -> 8704.84s]  the regular world and not the screen. Can't talk. Turn up the gamma. I could. Does the character
[8704.84s -> 8712.52s]  even have a goal? Do I just have night vision? Find the exit into Pigsville. He's just like,
[8712.52s -> 8719.50s]  all right, get out of here. Ready? Go have some fun with your new 3d glasses. Okay. This is fun.
[8719.50s -> 8735.06s]  And what was it? What do I do? What's the point of this whole universe this way?
[8736.65s -> 8747.29s]  Wait, I came from this way. Fucking mazes. I just spit all over the monitor right now.
[8747.29s -> 8753.37s]  Whatever. This doesn't even help. This doesn't help. This doesn't help me. I would rather have
[8753.37s -> 8796.68s]  the flashlight on. I earn the gamma up. I will. I will. I will. I feel like that's cheating.
[8796.68s -> 8810.28s]  Oh my God. A ladder. Thank you. Go. That's an old link. Everybody's like, I'm going to get them.
[8810.36s -> 8826.18s]  I'm going to get them. Oh, light. Thank God. Turn up the gamma, you sardine.
[8831.43s -> 8849.48s]  Oh, that hurts. Don't use that up here. Did I have a gun? I'm still technically in the prison,
[8849.48s -> 8863.53s]  right? Something's going on here. I'm going to take a look. Wasn't that guy just really
[8863.53s -> 8871.54s]  came out of like the bathroom? The lights on? No. How could he see in the dark? Does everybody
[8871.54s -> 8899.99s]  have the Riddick 3d glasses power? Wait, he was actually in the bathroom. Don't turn those lights
[8899.99s -> 8920.42s]  on. Keep them off. Oh, but wait, I can open all. Oh, I can open all the lockers. Oh, money. What
[8920.42s -> 8937.74s]  do you even spend the money on? Well, you know, this actually really reminds me of this. I feel
[8937.74s -> 8950.20s]  like I'm really drunk looking from my hotel room. This one is two or one. No, I find it is up here.
[8950.20s -> 8962.18s]  Oh, there's a rifle in there. I mean, they close one eye and get really, really close.
[8964.70s -> 8982.92s]  Two and two. That's not it. Move. I want to open this one. There's going to be a secret in these.
[8982.92s -> 9000.71s]  Yep. Civilian outfit now. I don't even need to do this. I can just walk around, right?
[9000.71s -> 9020.78s]  Can't even shoot that shit. Stupid. I am now dressed as him. See? All right. Cool. I mean,
[9020.78s -> 9029.11s]  I know you. What's the point of having these clothes on if I don't wear a mask?
[9031.48s -> 9047.08s]  I'm very recognizable. This is why I need to get a whatever. Get a fake beard. These guys recognize
[9047.08s -> 9063.54s]  me. What is this one? Two. All right. That hurts my eyes. The gun. I don't have a gun anymore. I'm
[9063.54s -> 9075.86s]  fine. Six, 12, 17. Okay. You're a celebrity. I don't have anything on me. Look, I don't like
[9075.86s -> 9090.95s]  this guy's walking at me. Six, 12, 17. Can I talk? How are you doing? How are you doing?
[9093.96s -> 9103.35s]  I'm all right. Can we go in here? Whose room is that? Okay. Let's go over here.
[9103.83s -> 9119.99s]  Get me out of here. Can I get him? Hey, you're an inmate. He's an inmate. Get him.
[9131.18s -> 9155.38s]  The guy go behind him T-pose and die. What? Somebody's fucking with me. He's like,
[9156.98s -> 9182.84s]  don't get too close. That's how they see through you. I'm just being annoying. I'm just ringing
[9182.84s -> 9194.09s]  everybody's doorbells and then running away. All right. He's practicing his speech. Cool.
[9194.81s -> 9214.63s]  2012. All right. Get you go that way. Don't look at me. You'll recognize me as Riddick. Wait,
[9214.63s -> 9225.83s]  talk to who? What's up? Hey, can I do anything? No, you can't. What's up? How come this guy
[9225.83s -> 9248.86s]  instantly right? Because I had a gun in my hand. How are you doing? Oh, okay. Nine, seven, 12.
[9250.22s -> 9259.85s]  Oh, are you going to open the door? No. What would the somebody get? Have you heard anything
[9259.85s -> 9269.27s]  about that Riddick? No. Okay. See you. No, I haven't heard anything.
[9275.11s -> 9281.91s]  So if wouldn't everybody know that I have a really low voice, how does Vin Diesel do a higher voice
[9281.91s -> 9285.51s]  if he doesn't want people, you know, how does he do like the, how does it go like this? Can he
[9287.11s -> 9304.55s]  feel like Vin Diesel? I don't think he'd be able to do it. Hey, if you see, what am I doing?
[9304.55s -> 9313.21s]  Just get out, right? I just have to leave. Have you heard anything about that Riddick?
[9313.21s -> 9335.67s]  What are you doing? Can't open this. This is the find a way out. Does something to do with the
[9335.67s -> 9353.88s]  codes that I'm seeing like the hamburger codes? I feel like it is. It's a hole. Have you heard
[9353.88s -> 9363.93s]  anything? Oh, I'm saying hole, hole, hole, hole. Where, where, where? I don't see a hole.
[9369.26s -> 9388.33s]  Really? What the fuck? Dude, come on. I was just trying to show off on Instagram. Leave me alone.
[9388.89s -> 9394.63s]  We have a really boring fucking job. We walk in circles. I'm trying to spice it up a little.
[9394.63s -> 9425.59s]  Have you heard anything about that Riddick? It's definitely something to do with like the ham.
[9427.30s -> 9448.97s]  What? Why did I just do that? All right. Don't be weird. They'll kill you Hank. Okay. So where
[9448.97s -> 9458.01s]  am I supposed to go? And one of these were the computers. How are you doing? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[9458.01s -> 9481.00s]  Okay. I forgot about this part. Get you out of there. 6, 12, 17. One of these doorbells is
[9481.00s -> 9492.25s]  going to do something. I know it. Six, nine, seven, 12. I'm just going to ring until somebody
[9492.25s -> 9529.59s]  answers. I'll find the right NPC when I ring every doorbell. What's happening? I found it.
[9529.59s -> 9552.28s]  Hey. Hey. Hey there. Hi. No, not the probe. No, no. Uh, okay. Are you, you all right, man?
[9552.28s -> 9573.56s]  I'm having a lot of butt head reactions. I'm noticing today. Uh, okay, man. Bye. See you later.
[9573.56s -> 9593.35s]  Uh, okay. An elation hatch. I can't touch it. I can't open it. Why is that locked up? Why? Why?
[9593.35s -> 9613.06s]  Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? I need a tool. Shit. I need a tool. Where do you guys has a tool
[9613.06s -> 9630.25s]  on you? You have a tool. Hi there. This is not going to work. Why would I do this? Hey man.
[9630.97s -> 9643.96s]  I'm going to need some eyes. Okay. I need to find Abbott. Wait, can I use his head? Wait,
[9644.60s -> 9672.71s]  I need hit. Hey man. Okay. Give me a break. I need to get Abbott's eyes, but how am I going
[9672.71s -> 9678.01s]  to bring them over there? I'm not going to be able to bring them over here. Are you serious? I'm
[9678.01s -> 9687.53s]  going to drag them through the whole level where I'm looking for Abbott. So you tell me I have to
[9687.53s -> 9708.94s]  kill Abbott, bring him over, scan his face. Hi there. Take his head. Am I a sicko? What do you,
[9708.94s -> 9726.68s]  you want me to take the guy's head off? There's lucky. Yo, I'm going to get that guy's eyes over
[9726.68s -> 9732.74s]  there. Remember German nine eight five me. I'm the sicko. Right. I'm the fucking weird guy.
[9733.30s -> 9750.46s]  He just like cut his head off and bring it with you. Okay. Where is he? Brad low. You didn't see
[9750.46s -> 9761.30s]  this. Okay. As far as you're concerned, this never happens. Okay. Where is Abbott? How you doing?
[9761.30s -> 9779.35s]  Where are you? I need your head. Abbott. Is that you? What's up? Abbott. How are you doing? Nope.
[9779.35s -> 9787.38s]  That's Wakefield. Wait a minute. What about his? What about Abbott's room? Can I go take a pair
[9787.38s -> 9792.22s]  of his glasses? Can I take a pic? Wait, there's got to be like a picture of Abbott smiling with
[9792.22s -> 9804.54s]  like his son or daughter or something, right? Just take the photo and scan the eyes in the photo.
[9804.86s -> 9825.58s]  He has to have his own locker room thing, right? Up top. No, Abbott. No, that's Kispert. Have you
[9825.58s -> 9829.14s]  heard anything about that? No. Have you heard? We have. Have you heard anything about Abbott?
[9829.14s -> 9837.26s]  Do you know where he is? Hey, Connor. Tell him to calm down. Where is he? Hey, if you see Abbott,
[9842.26s -> 9848.47s]  well, shit, man. I don't know where he is. I can't relay that message unless I know where he is.
[9849.98s -> 9856.54s]  He's the guy behind the wait. It's the guy that's stuck in the door. He's the stuck guy. Oh,
[9858.10s -> 9873.46s]  well, how do I? Don't do that. They think it's weird and they'll kill you. Okay. He's the guy,
[9873.46s -> 9880.28s]  the door stuck guy. All right. All right. All right. I'll go to the door stuck guy to kill all
[9880.28s -> 9887.61s]  these people. No, I do not have to kill all these people. He's door. Okay. Where was door stuck guy?
[9887.61s -> 9908.34s]  This is he's down here, right? No, I don't know. Wrong way. He's down this way. I have to set the
[9908.34s -> 9919.26s]  I have to do the alarm first. Are we certain he's in there? Wait, so I have to actually do the alarm
[9919.26s -> 9926.62s]  first? Why would I? Why would that happen? I'm going to fight my way through everybody. You have
[9926.62s -> 9968.33s]  to just start killing people. Okay. All right. I'm going to just do it. God damn it. What's that on
[9968.33s -> 10009.42s]  my head? Take the lights out. There we go. All right. Riddick mode. Wait, this is open now.
[10010.42s -> 10023.59s]  Oh, this is open. I did it. Did I need to open? I don't even need his eyes.
[10023.59s -> 10043.46s]  All the same. First, they tell you how much they need. You didn't even need it when you look away.
[10045.00s -> 10057.16s]  Anyway, you can take this. Did you get me? Audible is 750 milliliters of cheap alcohol.
[10057.16s -> 10062.84s]  I could probably. Hey, man. Long time no see. Leave me alone, man. I'm on duty.
[10062.84s -> 10072.41s]  You can talk to Jenkins, but you can't talk to me. That's not fair. What's going on? Hey, Bondo. Hey,
[10072.41s -> 10079.30s]  where's Abbott? Abbott? Well, he's got the fancy place up there. He's not keen on visitors. Abbott
[10079.30s -> 10084.82s]  only answers for his delivery. Whose delivery? What deliveries? Mostly guns. Shipments come
[10084.82s -> 10099.35s]  pretty regular like. Okay. He needs, he wants guns. What can I do for you, sir? What do you have to
[10099.35s -> 10104.79s]  sell? What are you selling? I have only the essentials. Cigarettes and ammunition. Plus I
[10104.79s -> 10112.30s]  have a light. I'm a uniform. It's regular. Do I get the uniform? Oh,
[10113.18s -> 10131.61s]  shotgun. I don't want anything. I'm cool. Okay. Have a good day, sir. Buy the smokes. Buy the
[10131.61s -> 10138.34s]  smokes. I don't want cigarettes. Leave me alone, man. I'm on duty. But you're just really falling
[10138.34s -> 10149.69s]  apart. No one cares. I, I guess we're going. He hates cigarettes. Yeah. I don't want to buy
[10149.77s -> 10161.13s]  cigarettes. I don't smoke cigarettes. We're looking for Abbott and we need to deliver some
[10161.69s -> 10177.00s]  guns to him. What's happening? Leave me alone. I'm on duty. You have some liquor, huh? I'll give you
[10177.00s -> 10187.94s]  50 UDs. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Hair of the dog. Should I do that? This whole damn plan just sweats the
[10187.94s -> 10195.86s]  life out of you. In the last 10 days, four inmates hang themselves on my watch compared to butchers.
[10195.86s -> 10206.02s]  The end of a rope. Don't look so bad. Oh, he's personal guard. That's 50 bucks though. That's a
[10206.02s -> 10223.30s]  lot. Hey, hey. All right. So let's go over here. He said his door was up here, right?
[10227.06s -> 10232.10s]  I've got a hellish shift. 60 hours in the straight. Wipe that smile off your face
[10232.10s -> 10252.31s]  and leave me alone. Will you? I'm just trying to get information, man. Hey, man. What's going on
[10252.31s -> 10285.98s]  in here? Obviously not because he answered the door. Can somebody talk to me? Somebody open the
[10285.98s -> 10294.34s]  door. I just want a friend, anybody. I want anyone to open the fucking door. Just give me anything,
[10294.34s -> 10309.32s]  please. People must have cameras because they know I'm coming and they just don't like me.
[10324.98s -> 10331.62s]  Seems inevitable. They drop one by one. Nobody likes me. At least the bottle doesn't talk back.
[10331.62s -> 10340.39s]  Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Why would we went up to one on the Australian
[10340.39s -> 10359.43s]  floor? Oh, I don't understand. Why are they saying good day? Who butchers? You seen him?
[10359.43s -> 10367.54s]  No, I just heard what he looks like. Kind of like that guy. Right. Okay. Leave me alone. I'm on duty.
[10367.54s -> 10377.91s]  Hi there. Kind of like that guy. Okay, that was fun. I guess I'll pick up the weapon case.
[10379.32s -> 10403.46s]  I'm on duty. Abbott. Oh, okay. I gotta be ready. I got a package. The door before a door.
[10404.02s -> 10420.06s]  Can you believe this guy? Who the fuck's in my apartment? Me. I just, I just buzzed in, man.
[10421.02s -> 10428.02s]  Hey, look, I have a package of rifles for you. You just opened the door for me, man.
[10430.18s -> 10467.54s]  The person? No. He knows who I am. Okay. Who else is in here? It was a person. I told you it was a
[10467.54s -> 10474.33s]  person. He's not, he was the clothes.
[10484.68s -> 10491.24s]  You and I are leaving Butcher Bay. Yeah, what happened to the uniform? Not bad, Johns. Someday
[10491.24s -> 10497.80s]  you might just learn how to do this for a living. Going somewhere with my prisoner, Johns?
[10499.24s -> 10514.10s]  Oh no, the double, double cross. Well, now what? I should just have him put slugs in both your
[10514.10s -> 10523.69s]  heads right now. Thanks, Carmen. It was just a matter of time and I was gonna bring Riddick back to you.
[10524.41s -> 10535.29s]  About our agreement, Johns, I'm willing to give you 20% on Riddick. Oh, I'm going to have to fight him in like the pit, right?
[10536.25s -> 10543.59s]  Let him answer. Or should we keep negotiating? He's punching him in the fucking stomach. I think he wants to hold up.
[10546.57s -> 10558.81s]  22%. I'll take it. What do you say? 22%. Nobody steals my property from my house, Johns.
[10559.61s -> 10583.96s]  I'll get them. My slam, Gary. What? Can I get his 22%? I bet on myself. I've got entire regions rioting.
[10583.96s -> 10591.16s]  My slam has become a damn war zone. I'm losing men faster than I can replace them and all of this
[10591.16s -> 10597.00s]  unrest. Well, it began soon after you arrived, Riddick. 22% of what, by the way? I don't know.
[10597.08s -> 10605.03s]  What? It would be a coincidence. Oh, don't sell yourself short. I can see why you
[10605.03s -> 10612.20s]  earned your rep. Most killed my second-in-command today. The treasure. Just working my way to the top.
[10614.86s -> 10625.58s]  Even more reason for me to bury you deep. I'm sending you to the mine, Riddick. I don't understand
[10625.58s -> 10633.02s]  why I let him go. Just shoot him. You'll be the target of every comm, looking to make his bones
[10633.02s -> 10648.70s]  with the Achilles. I expect things could get ugly. I'll be disappointed. You're gonna do the
[10649.50s -> 10654.98s]  rifle in the head, right? And then I'm gonna wake up? No? Wow. They didn't do that. Shit,
[10654.98s -> 10663.98s]  that's in every single thing ever made. I'm surprised. I just got a slight push in the
[10663.98s -> 10701.18s]  shoulder. I thought it was gonna be, eat this bastard. And you wake up here. Have me? Oh,
[10701.18s -> 10754.62s]  fucking Riddick. A different voice actor? Why didn't you run? Riddick's dead. No, there I am.
[10755.26s -> 10779.46s]  Always needs transportation, so do I. I'm still alive. Hey, there's the fall joke. He finally
[10779.46s -> 10789.86s]  did it. It took him two and a half, three hours. All right, here's the question. Can I get this guy
[10789.86s -> 10805.86s]  absolutely riddled with bullets? But they're everywhere. Get inside. I can do this. Wait,
[10805.86s -> 10816.54s]  we have to all go in here? Shit. Brian, this is really good mime in here. Quiet. Let's watch the
[10816.54s -> 10830.62s]  show. It didn't give me fucking opportunity to make my YouTube joke. Oh shit, there is no talking.
[10831.54s -> 10848.42s]  Oh, I wanted this was gonna just turn and talk. Not now. We'll talk later. Talk to me. Not now.
[10848.42s -> 10866.78s]  I'm getting the fuck out of here. You think you can contain Riddick? Big fucking mistake.
[10867.58s -> 10881.46s]  What happened to that guy? What are you doing? I don't know. Okay, I have no idea. I have a
[10881.54s -> 10887.24s]  horrible, horrible attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. That means if there's
[10887.24s -> 10894.23s]  not constant action and constant conflict, I go. I lose my mind. I know some things you'd want to
[10894.23s -> 10900.33s]  know. Let's talk in here. Getting out of Max is one thing. After you show above ground, some even
[10900.33s -> 10906.49s]  think you're gonna push Jagger Valance down. But double Max is quite another. People are watching
[10907.05s -> 10913.11s]  They never see me coming. Tell us too late. Jagger is the one down here.
[10914.39s -> 10921.70s]  So far. Point is, this is a super prison underneath the prison. Your double Max home
[10921.70s -> 10927.86s]  ends with this hall. Unless you step into the circle and defeat a blue skin. Centurion arranges
[10927.86s -> 10933.94s]  all the fights. Talk to him and talk to dog bone. He might help you get down to like a third or
[10933.94s -> 10952.68s]  fourth layer. We're gonna get to see the Dante's Inferno of prison structure. Who's this guy?
[10953.58s -> 10961.08s]  Centurion. Hey Riddick, let's go. Time to get into the ring. What? Why? Set it up. Sure. A fight
[10961.08s -> 10968.04s]  will cost you five UDs. But I'll let you in free. Try not to disappoint. Just send me a victim.
[10968.04s -> 10975.38s]  I can't initiate any fights. Slam rules. So you have to find a victim, as you say. I suggest
[10975.38s -> 10986.36s]  Herman the blue skin at the gate. How about you? You. You. You. You. You. It's hard to say you.
[10988.36s -> 10998.87s]  I don't want any trouble. Stay away. Like that. Like that guy. He's that bad newcomer.
[11001.75s -> 11004.47s]  It's my dream to work in the mines and meet Jagger Valance.
[11007.99s -> 11012.23s]  Hey man, how's it going? Got a med station back here. I'll let you use it if you pay me.
[11012.23s -> 11022.04s]  Have to fight this guy? No. No need. Why would I need that? All right, you. Kill you. I get past.
[11023.56s -> 11030.12s]  He's always a deeper voice. Let Centurion know. I'm ready to beat the shit out of you.
[11030.12s -> 11033.72s]  This feels bad. This guy sounds like he's old. Why would I pick the oldest,
[11033.72s -> 11044.07s]  weakest, frailest guy in here? They stand better than you.
[11044.07s -> 11050.02s]  Great. You have a challenger. Prepare to fight, Riddick. All right, we have a fight.
[11050.02s -> 11052.82s]  We have a fight. The infamous Riddick against Herman.
[11057.22s -> 11061.06s]  The infamous Riddick versus this other guy. Who cares? He's dead.
[11062.92s -> 11066.12s]  Nobody cares about him. He's fucking guaranteed to die.
[11081.45s -> 11095.91s]  Infamous Riddick. The infamous Riddick. Mr. Riddick. What happened? Did I just lose to Herman?
[11097.88s -> 11111.69s]  Next time, come ready to fight. I can't. I have to fucking focus.
[11116.30s -> 11124.25s]  You can fight again if you want. For free? But don't make me feel sorry for you, Riddick.
[11124.25s -> 11128.97s]  Great. You have a challenger. Prepare to fight, Riddick. Why does he keep telling me to fuck off?
[11128.97s -> 11133.64s]  All right, we have a fight. We have a fight. The infamous Riddick against Herman.
[11133.64s -> 11141.21s]  All bets are off. And remember, 5% goes to Jagger Bell.
[11141.21s -> 11149.29s]  Do not step out of the circle. Yeah. Rule two, stay in the circle until one of you is dead.
[11149.29s -> 11154.33s]  Hey, rule three, she rule one and two. Where's the fucking comedy? You had an opportunity.
[11165.05s -> 11175.80s]  Out of the circle. He went out of the circle. You may have survived this time, Riddick,
[11175.80s -> 11179.56s]  but to get somewhere, you're gonna have to fight and win.
[11179.56s -> 11195.67s]  I did win. Oh, he's dead. He's dead. So, what, I just keep killing people down here?
[11197.19s -> 11202.49s]  Five bucks, and I'll suggest a new fighter. You win the show, you're 20 bucks richer.
[11202.49s -> 11208.33s]  Yeah. Bring me the next one. Next is Basim. You'll find him in the courtyard.
[11231.64s -> 11244.09s]  I am? I didn't do anything. What, I can't like wave my fucking arms around? What if I-
[11244.73s -> 11250.65s]  I'm gonna get so sick of this shit. Don't wave your arms around in front of the cameras.
[11254.23s -> 11269.42s]  Feed ward. No fucking in recreation area? What? What is that? There's like a fucking bug in here.
[11270.06s -> 11293.35s]  Come here. I'm trying to catch the fucking bugs. Just hide for a second. Okay, we're good.
[11298.86s -> 11303.83s]  Listen, Cricket's got the best sheaves you can buy. Okay, thanks.
[11304.47s -> 11311.06s]  I got a custom-made bloody sharp sheave. Cuts through a belly like a soft-boiled egg.
[11311.86s -> 11320.38s]  30 bucks? I'll take it. I'll take it. Here, take care, man. I'll see. Take the cash and
[11320.38s -> 11327.27s]  hide it in the usual place. Nice. Okay, don't take that out. Somebody will see it.
[11330.58s -> 11342.42s]  Where's this person I'm supposed to be? I didn't do anything. Wait, am I about-
[11346.94s -> 11353.85s]  He's clean. How? Where is it? Get out of here. Where is the ship?
[11355.51s -> 11361.03s]  That's the question that you need to ask. Where is the ship?
[11364.23s -> 11382.36s]  No, don't do it again. Look here. He's not gonna find it this time, right? He's clean. Get out of
[11382.36s -> 11389.96s]  here. I so badly want to take it out and just be like, haha, you missed it. Where's this guy?
[11389.96s -> 11397.26s]  There's a person here I'm supposed to be fighting. Didn't he say he was out in the
[11398.30s -> 11414.33s]  courtyard or something? I didn't see anybody. Aha, you missed it. Yeah. Hey, when does the
[11414.33s -> 11429.14s]  prison level end? After about 10 to 12 hours, I think. Hey, guys. Look what I smuggled in here.
[11447.24s -> 11451.32s]  Hey, I swear on my mother. Look what he's gonna fucking punch the bullets out of the air.
[11452.52s -> 11458.36s]  I ain't bullshitting, Trico. I promise it's true. Wait, which one of you guys wants to fight me?
[11458.36s -> 11464.84s]  You got a problem, huh? Hey, I do. So, Reno's blessings don't come free. $20? We gotta release
[11464.84s -> 11470.76s]  from the guard with the names of some snitches. Let some asshole grab them. Okay. I want to know
[11470.76s -> 11481.88s]  who. And I want that. Oh, boy. Okay. I'm like pants down. Also, he discovered the mind.
[11482.36s -> 11489.48s]  This is like fucking pants are down. Sure, I'll do it. I'll find anything. I'll let you know.
[11489.48s -> 11495.64s]  I'm trying to explain. Relax. Sorry, Holmes. Anyway, this guy, he like discovered the mind.
[11495.64s -> 11500.76s]  Who would I define somebody that stole the list? Toto Cuellas is in charge here.
[11500.76s -> 11504.68s]  Get out of here, maestro. Cuellas is our man. They talk to Cuellas, all right? He runs the show.
[11504.68s -> 11508.60s]  Get out of here, maestro. Toto Cuellas is our man. They talk to Cuellas, all right? He runs the show.
[11508.60s -> 11511.72s]  Toto Cuellas is in charge here. They talk to Cuellas, all right? He runs the show.
[11511.72s -> 11530.63s]  Um, everything is to talk to you. Okay. I guess I gotta go over here. Talk to Cuellas.
[11535.18s -> 11540.47s]  Hey. All right. Where is this guy? I want to fight the dude. Wait, do you have a secret list?
[11541.19s -> 11543.83s]  Stay away from me. I got the important stuff.
[11548.14s -> 11551.02s]  Who has the list? Do you have a list on you? I need a list.
[11554.90s -> 11564.68s]  I want you to talk. Hey, guys. Hey, man. You want to buy a few smokes?
[11564.68s -> 11567.69s]  I can sell you a pack of smokes. Sure, I'll take a pack of smokes.
[11567.69s -> 11569.69s]  Or maybe you need some info on them. For free.
[11573.13s -> 11576.68s]  What do you know? What do you know I know now?
[11576.68s -> 11580.92s]  There's a big mining area underneath us, right? It's off limits to everyone.
[11580.92s -> 11587.08s]  But Jagger Valance is down there, so I hear. Section D is an entrance, if you want to take a
[11587.08s -> 11594.20s]  look. And if you want something other than smokes, say hello to Monster in the diner.
[11594.20s -> 11597.48s]  Good link. And about, yeah, it's been 20 minutes.
[11602.63s -> 11607.38s]  This is not even me, though. You know what I mean? This is not even me.
[11608.02s -> 11639.19s]  This is just, it's just Riddick holding these. All right. Yeah, who knows what's going on here?
[11640.15s -> 11642.55s]  Okay, who knows? You know, I can kill it.
[11643.99s -> 11647.69s]  Why did I miss it? Stop, I'm not. Wait, this is the guy.
[11647.69s -> 11652.10s]  So you want to fight me? That's good, because I can use the prize money.
[11653.14s -> 11656.18s]  See you in the ring, punk. Can I stab this guy in the ring?
[11657.14s -> 11662.49s]  All right, I'm ready. I see you in the ring.
[11662.49s -> 11674.94s]  Okay, stay back. I need to get him, but there's no way
[11674.94s -> 11678.14s]  I can get the ship through. There's an old trick you can use.
[11678.86s -> 11682.14s]  You have an old style filter smoke and a lighter.
[11682.14s -> 11686.14s]  I'm going to smoke the bitch to death? No, you dumb fuck.
[11687.82s -> 11691.66s]  You burn the filter and work it into a needle. It's kind of fragile,
[11691.66s -> 11695.58s]  so you don't want to work it too much. Stab him in the neck and he's done, man.
[11696.38s -> 11706.18s]  Shit, I heard of that thing, of course. That's what I'm going to do.
[11706.18s -> 11716.63s]  Kind of like that. I did it wrong. I didn't even do it right.
[11716.63s -> 11718.87s]  I was supposed to stab him in the neck and I stabbed him in the ass.
[11718.87s -> 11721.99s]  I need to get him, but there's no way I can get the ship through.
[11721.99s -> 11724.84s]  There's an old- I've never seen you before.
[11724.84s -> 11730.87s]  Want to make an impression? There are two PPE members in section A of the courtyard.
[11730.87s -> 11735.35s]  Two PPE members? Those bastards stole the red tube that they
[11735.35s -> 11740.39s]  really need. Find out where they stashed it and bring it to me.
[11740.39s -> 11743.67s]  Okay, I'll pay you. Okay.
[11744.95s -> 11750.04s]  I'll check it out. All right, I have way too many quests.
[11751.99s -> 11754.47s]  Hey man, want to try your luck with the dice? Yes.
[11756.18s -> 11762.55s]  Bet five on two, bet five- where's bet 50? Pay off 16 to one.
[11762.55s -> 11766.23s]  All right, bet five UDs on 11. 16 to one.
[11766.23s -> 11769.27s]  Give me the yellow. Okay, let's roll the dice.
[11774.20s -> 11782.52s]  It's high llama. Hey man, want to try your luck with the dice?
[11782.52s -> 11789.70s]  Yes. Two or 12. On aces and boxcars.
[11790.26s -> 11794.68s]  Okay, let's roll the dice. Here comes a 12 right there, double sixes.
[11797.11s -> 11803.45s]  Is any craps or ace deuce? You lose, man.
[11803.45s -> 11812.46s]  Hey man, want to try your luck with the dice? Take the ace deuce.
[11812.46s -> 11814.78s]  16. Okay, let's roll the dice.
[11818.76s -> 11823.88s]  Bingo. Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!
[11825.96s -> 11834.68s]  What? I didn't pick 12?
[11842.92s -> 11847.08s]  You're Riddick, yeah? Heard you pulled off some stunts in the circle.
[11847.80s -> 11851.48s]  Say, you got a mining job? Nobody wants me to do something for them.
[11851.48s -> 11853.72s]  Need one. Impossible.
[11853.72s -> 11858.94s]  Unless you get assigned by the warden. Reason I ask is because I want to know if
[11858.94s -> 11864.14s]  Jagger Balance is still around. I almost feel like that every single
[11864.14s -> 11867.74s]  character in this game is doing a Vin Diesel impression.
[11871.11s -> 11873.27s]  They were told that in the voice acting booth.
[11878.09s -> 11881.21s]  If that's true, that's awesome. That's hysterical. I hope that's the case.
[11886.25s -> 11890.97s]  Hey man, how about you help me collect some debts and I'll lend you money.
[11891.61s -> 11895.82s]  I heard you're a pretty good fighter. Who owes you?
[11896.62s -> 11902.22s]  Binks. One of the K3 guys in the diner. But you can't do him with muscles.
[11902.22s -> 11904.38s]  I'm running. I have so many missions to do.
[11904.38s -> 11906.38s]  Drop it in Binks food. But don't kill him.
[11906.38s -> 11909.18s]  Get some poison? I'm the sender of that message.
[11909.50s -> 11913.18s]  All right. So I have to put poison in somebody's food.
[11913.18s -> 11916.30s]  Fight a guy. How many missions do I have? Okay.
[11917.26s -> 11922.39s]  Go talk to Dogbone. Go beat up the fighter.
[11923.77s -> 11927.05s]  Find out who took the list. Find the red tube.
[11928.25s -> 11932.58s]  Where Jagger Balance is. And poison a guy.
[11934.82s -> 11938.02s]  Okay. Uh, I'm going to go over here. Bye.
[11938.98s -> 11942.65s]  You know the vents go all over this place.
[11943.72s -> 11948.04s]  There's one that goes from the dying hall over to Zoda's land in tower 19.
[11949.24s -> 11953.32s]  Anyway, Padilla, the crazy mother. Hey, do you want anything?
[11954.04s -> 11958.46s]  The mines. Tell me everything you know.
[11958.46s -> 11961.74s]  You really want to go down there? Like Jagger Balance?
[11962.30s -> 11966.22s]  That's why I asked. There's a door beside the work pass
[11966.22s -> 11970.70s]  checkpoint. This guy locked. The only ones that have a key are the guards.
[11970.70s -> 11974.38s]  The all-ranking ones. Traffic. If you can manage a one-on-one with an officer.
[11975.34s -> 11980.22s]  One-on-one with an officer. And this Jagger Balance, he a problem?
[11980.22s -> 11986.86s]  Why is Riddick Brooks so small? He kind of does. He actually kind of does look pretty little.
[11986.86s -> 11990.06s]  You're right. I haven't even noticed that the whole time.
[11994.86s -> 12000.30s]  Hey, homie. You want to trade drugs? All right. Do me a favor.
[12001.18s -> 12003.35s]  Okay. Tell me more.
[12003.35s -> 12008.79s]  Okay. I need your help on two things, man. First, I need my injector back from the PPPs.
[12008.79s -> 12011.99s]  Look, Gulag has some history with him. He'll tell you more.
[12011.99s -> 12017.43s]  Second, Basim is really bumming me out. So I need you to waste him in the ring for me.
[12017.43s -> 12019.03s]  What are you going to do? How about it, man?
[12019.03s -> 12023.18s]  Let's go. I can do it. I'm already going to do that.
[12023.18s -> 12026.38s]  What? You want to front me? I am Sorrenos.
[12026.38s -> 12029.50s]  You want to see the PPPs? Check the A section.
[12030.46s -> 12042.82s]  All right. PPPs. I think I have enough stuff to do. Work? What's this? Work pass?
[12043.46s -> 12056.84s]  I have to go to the diner, don't I? Wait, I actually have to do work?
[12057.64s -> 12061.85s]  I'm not going to help you get down to the mines, if that's what you want.
[12062.65s -> 12066.17s]  It's impossible. The mines. I need to get to them.
[12067.05s -> 12071.05s]  You should talk to Flores in the courtyard. I just worked on it.
[12071.13s -> 12072.97s]  I didn't just say you can't do anything?
[12072.97s -> 12075.53s]  Just go off my glass and I'll be damned if I didn't forget my glasses.
[12075.53s -> 12080.81s]  If you're going down there, could you check around the big elevator in Upper Mines?
[12082.09s -> 12084.01s]  Sure, let's just do everything.
[12087.53s -> 12095.34s]  You have a quest? Oh! I just want to see if this guy has a mission to do. My God.
[12107.93s -> 12112.71s]  I don't know the code. I'm supposed to know every code.
[12116.09s -> 12118.25s]  I'm so bad they want to stab this thing in the back.
[12118.73s -> 12128.22s]  Do I know the code for this door? Okay, I'm not fucking around with this guy.
[12129.26s -> 12136.57s]  I have so many missions, I have no idea what they are.
[12136.57s -> 12139.29s]  I'm just going to walk around and aimlessly try to figure out one of them.
[12140.09s -> 12148.30s]  We have to go to the dining hall. I have to fight the guy in the circle,
[12148.30s -> 12153.96s]  go to the dining hall, poison a guy, get the red vial, talk to Gulag.
[12156.23s -> 12160.78s]  Where's Gulag? I don't even know.
[12161.90s -> 12163.50s]  Three people want me to kill two people.
[12166.78s -> 12170.84s]  I don't know where they stashed it, but maybe you can find a way to get it.
[12172.20s -> 12173.40s]  Okay, right. Now...
[12175.26s -> 12177.02s]  Hey man, want to try your luck with...
[12177.66s -> 12182.79s]  Give me the yellow.
[12183.51s -> 12185.27s]  Okay, let's roll the dice.
[12185.99s -> 12190.28s]  Let's go.
[12190.28s -> 12192.20s]  It's 11 or high limelight.
[12192.20s -> 12194.20s]  That's fucking, that's 16 to 1.
[12194.20s -> 12194.70s]  You win.
[12195.80s -> 12199.16s]  How much money does this guy's got? What, it's 5 bucks? 16 to 1?
[12200.18s -> 12202.42s]  I just made it all back. And then some. See you later.
[12203.38s -> 12210.87s]  All right, I could fight that guy. I got to go back this way.
[12211.59s -> 12218.62s]  I want to go to the dining hall, but I want to fight somebody in the circle.
[12218.62s -> 12219.82s]  Where is this? Here he is.
[12219.82s -> 12220.78s]  All right, let's go. I'm ready.
[12221.66s -> 12222.38s]  No, it's not you.
[12229.69s -> 12231.13s]  Gamble more feed ward.
[12231.13s -> 12232.97s]  All right, wait, wait, wait. I want to go here.
[12232.97s -> 12242.34s]  Fight the dude? I will. I just want to see in here.
[12242.34s -> 12248.10s]  All right, how do I like actually go in the feed ward?
[12248.10s -> 12248.60s]  Here we go.
[12249.30s -> 12257.98s]  All right.
[12261.22s -> 12264.41s]  Who the fuck is this guy?
[12274.86s -> 12275.90s]  Does he have to kill him?
[12276.70s -> 12285.10s]  Okay, nobody cares, right?
[12285.66s -> 12287.80s]  Oh, I got poison.
[12290.18s -> 12291.70s]  Poison is food. Poison is food.
[12291.70s -> 12293.06s]  Poison is food. Poison is food.
[12295.61s -> 12296.41s]  Is that the guy?
[12296.41s -> 12297.45s]  Whose food do I poison?
[12298.01s -> 12302.46s]  Is this guy?
[12315.18s -> 12315.68s]  Okay.
[12320.90s -> 12323.06s]  Hey, by the way, can I tell you?
[12323.06s -> 12328.86s]  The slop is delicious today.
[12328.86s -> 12331.29s]  Fuck off, man. We're busy.
[12331.29s -> 12332.65s]  Fuck off, man. We're busy.
[12343.26s -> 12344.38s]  He's still, he's gone.
[12346.26s -> 12348.66s]  Hey, look, this is your food right over here.
[12348.66s -> 12349.38s]  It's so good.
[12362.41s -> 12364.49s]  This is eat. This is your food over here.
[12366.50s -> 12369.30s]  Eat, eat, eat, eat.
[12369.30s -> 12370.98s]  Fuck off, man. We're busy.
[12370.98s -> 12371.48s]  Eat.
[12384.28s -> 12385.32s]  He's so busy.
[12385.32s -> 12387.80s]  He's practicing whatever moonwalking.
[12387.80s -> 12388.60s]  I don't know what he's doing.
[12389.82s -> 12390.78s]  He'll eventually get there.
[12390.78s -> 12391.66s]  Well, can I talk to anybody else?
[12391.66s -> 12392.54s]  Hey, get lost.
[12392.54s -> 12393.66s]  Nobody likes me, right?
[12393.66s -> 12395.34s]  You want some free advice, buddy?
[12395.34s -> 12397.90s]  If you're carrying something, stay away from the guards in the yard.
[12397.90s -> 12399.26s]  They'll set you without a second thought.
[12399.26s -> 12402.14s]  Oh, he's eating the wrong food.
[12410.57s -> 12412.71s]  He's ate somebody else's food.
[12418.14s -> 12419.34s]  That's not even the poison one.
[12419.34s -> 12420.86s]  I think this guy just feels bad.
[12432.65s -> 12436.78s]  Tell him, tell him I'll pay back his debt.
[12436.78s -> 12437.90s]  Quest completed.
[12441.46s -> 12444.42s]  Dinah's closed, but life could be worse.
[12445.38s -> 12446.66s]  What's on your mind?
[12446.66s -> 12450.42s]  What are you trading?
[12450.42s -> 12451.70s]  Not much today.
[12451.70s -> 12454.10s]  I got a vent tool, a club, and a shiv.
[12454.74s -> 12455.54s]  All custom made.
[12455.54s -> 12456.50s]  I'll take a vent tool.
[12457.46s -> 12459.29s]  A vent tool.
[12459.29s -> 12460.25s]  Use it well.
[12460.25s -> 12461.21s]  I'll also take...
[12461.21s -> 12462.33s]  I only have a shiv.
[12462.33s -> 12463.05s]  I'll take a club.
[12463.05s -> 12464.09s]  And a club.
[12464.09s -> 12464.81s]  A club?
[12466.41s -> 12467.37s]  I'll take the club.
[12467.37s -> 12467.93s]  It's 50 bucks.
[12467.93s -> 12468.89s]  Here it is.
[12468.89s -> 12470.65s]  I'm gonna use my gambling winnings on something.
[12472.52s -> 12473.96s]  Oh, dude, I got a fucking club.
[12478.26s -> 12481.62s]  I just wanted to look at it.
[12481.62s -> 12486.42s]  How do we do that transaction is what I want to know.
[12487.30s -> 12489.30s]  So I can't look at it, but he can hand it to me.
[12491.24s -> 12492.28s]  Oh, god damn it.
[12492.92s -> 12514.55s]  This is for killing Harman.
[12516.92s -> 12518.23s]  Yeah, but I have a knife.
[12519.11s -> 12519.67s]  Big mistake.
[12521.19s -> 12528.57s]  How come there are no cameras over here?
[12530.25s -> 12537.30s]  Stop following me.
[12537.30s -> 12539.14s]  I got important stuff to stop.
[12543.38s -> 12544.82s]  Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[12545.91s -> 12546.79s]  Wait, the...
[12546.79s -> 12547.67s]  This is the...
[12547.67s -> 12548.39s]  I got the...
[12548.39s -> 12549.35s]  I got the map.
[12549.35s -> 12549.91s]  All right, let's go.
[12565.91s -> 12570.95s]  Hey, get lost.
[12570.95s -> 12572.63s]  You want some free advice, buddy?
[12572.63s -> 12574.47s]  If you're carrying something, stay away from the guards
[12574.47s -> 12575.19s]  in the yard.
[12575.19s -> 12576.63s]  They'll set you without a second thought.
[12576.63s -> 12577.35s]  I can blast it.
[12578.57s -> 12580.49s]  Hey, I'm from fucking Boston.
[12580.49s -> 12581.29s]  God, gods.
[12582.17s -> 12583.29s]  Get those gods out of the yard.
[12587.90s -> 12589.58s]  All right, now I'm not gonna bother him or anything.
[12589.58s -> 12590.70s]  He'll just go right for it, right?
[12594.66s -> 12595.70s]  All right, here we go.
[12598.97s -> 12600.01s]  It's gonna be so hard.
[12601.29s -> 12602.73s]  Never mind, let's go.
[12602.73s -> 12605.58s]  Just get away.
[12605.58s -> 12606.06s]  He'll do it.
[12606.06s -> 12606.62s]  Turn your back.
[12606.62s -> 12609.90s]  He'll do it in one, two, three.
[12609.90s -> 12610.40s]  No.
[12612.87s -> 12613.37s]  What?
[12613.37s -> 12615.34s]  What detected?
[12615.98s -> 12625.59s]  Out of here.
[12625.59s -> 12627.19s]  Motherfucker.
[12627.19s -> 12627.99s]  Who's saying that?
[12627.99s -> 12630.15s]  All right, sit down and eat, please, so I can move on.
[12636.01s -> 12637.29s]  Eat your food.
[12638.65s -> 12639.45s]  Fuck off, man.
[12639.45s -> 12640.01s]  We're busy.
[12702.22s -> 12704.22s]  Eat the fucking breakfast, man.
[12705.32s -> 12706.68s]  Sit down and eat, please.
[12706.68s -> 12707.40s]  Fuck off, man.
[12707.40s -> 12707.96s]  We're busy.
[12707.96s -> 12708.44s]  Eat this.
[12708.44s -> 12708.84s]  Sit down.
[12708.84s -> 12710.36s]  Wait, somebody else is eating his food.
[12710.36s -> 12711.32s]  Hey, get lost.
[12718.42s -> 12721.30s]  That's where they take you if they don't want witnesses.
[12721.30s -> 12723.22s]  No surveillance there, man.
[12723.22s -> 12723.70s]  Nothing.
[12723.70s -> 12724.66s]  For you, watching...
[12724.66s -> 12725.46s]  No surveillance.
[12725.46s -> 12725.96s]  Hmm.
[12741.40s -> 12746.12s]  I don't even know who this guy is.
[12750.25s -> 12750.73s]  No.
[12750.73s -> 12757.53s]  Hey, sit down and fucking eat before I get bored and start killing everybody in here, man.
[12760.17s -> 12763.13s]  Dinah's closed, but life could be worse.
[12764.09s -> 12765.91s]  What's on your mind?
[12765.91s -> 12767.91s]  I would like, uh, love if I could have...
[12767.91s -> 12768.87s]  Not much today.
[12768.87s -> 12769.19s]  Event tool.
[12769.19s -> 12771.51s]  I got event tool, a club, and a shiv.
[12772.15s -> 12773.11s]  All custom made.
[12773.67s -> 12776.17s]  Event tool.
[12776.17s -> 12778.17s]  What did you say about killing all the NPCs?
[12778.17s -> 12778.89s]  I know.
[12778.89s -> 12779.69s]  I know.
[12779.69s -> 12781.93s]  I only have a shiv and a club.
[12785.56s -> 12786.60s]  He's soft locked.
[12789.62s -> 12790.42s]  I don't think he is.
[12791.22s -> 12801.06s]  Is he soft locked for real?
[12802.94s -> 12803.74s]  Fuck off, man.
[12803.74s -> 12804.30s]  We're busy.
[12805.90s -> 12806.70s]  Fuck off, man.
[12806.70s -> 12807.50s]  We're busy.
[12807.50s -> 12808.54s]  I can't club him.
[12809.98s -> 12819.27s]  How did two people die back here?
[12819.27s -> 12820.55s]  I didn't kill two people, did I?
[12821.75s -> 12822.31s]  Want a trade?
[12822.95s -> 12825.51s]  Me and Monster run the trade market in Butcher Bay.
[12825.51s -> 12826.39s]  He's got the goods.
[12826.95s -> 12827.91s]  I gots the smokes.
[12830.66s -> 12831.94s]  Tell me about Monster.
[12832.50s -> 12834.98s]  Yeah, he's running goods from his spot in the diner.
[12834.98s -> 12836.26s]  He's probably in there with Chang.
[12837.67s -> 12838.79s]  So, what do you say?
[12838.79s -> 12839.59s]  How about some smoke?
[12839.59s -> 12841.27s]  Yeah, I'm like...
[12841.27s -> 12842.31s]  Give me the smokes.
[12842.87s -> 12844.15s]  Okay, here you go.
[12845.19s -> 12849.13s]  Ooh, good trade.
[12880.46s -> 12883.02s]  Come back when you have the whole snitch list.
[12883.02s -> 12883.58s]  I've got it.
[12884.54s -> 12888.94s]  Don't I have the snitch list?
[12892.06s -> 12892.62s]  Map.
[12892.62s -> 12895.42s]  This map shows the location of the secret stash
[12895.42s -> 12897.82s]  far back of the feed board behind a loose panel.
[12898.62s -> 12898.94s]  Really?
[12913.67s -> 12914.39s]  Loose panel?
[12922.04s -> 12923.96s]  Far back behind a loose panel.
[12927.22s -> 12930.66s]  Ah, and there it is.
[12931.46s -> 12936.58s]  And I've got a protractor and I got fake Halloween blood.
[12937.30s -> 12938.46s]  What is this stuff?
[12939.99s -> 12941.99s]  The tube that was stolen from Gulag.
[12941.99s -> 12942.95s]  Injector.
[12942.95s -> 12945.19s]  A syringe used by some drug addict.
[12951.98s -> 12952.70s]  He's not gonna eat.
[12953.34s -> 12955.88s]  Step away, okay?
[12956.60s -> 12958.57s]  I've done my rounds anyway.
[12958.57s -> 12962.95s]  I feel like get him out of his animation loop he's in.
[12963.75s -> 12964.47s]  I can't punch him.
[12964.47s -> 12965.19s]  I'm gonna get attacked.
[12965.91s -> 12967.32s]  I'm gonna reload the area.
[12968.04s -> 12977.88s]  Hey, look what I got.
[12977.88s -> 12980.44s]  Come back when you have the whole snitch list.
[12982.20s -> 12987.74s]  All right, I'm gonna come back.
[12987.74s -> 13007.69s]  You want me to actually softlock.
[13007.69s -> 13009.21s]  Your entire game is gonna be ruined.
[13009.21s -> 13009.71s]  What?
[13012.01s -> 13012.65s]  Where?
[13012.65s -> 13013.77s]  Fisher too?
[13013.77s -> 13014.27s]  Don't know.
[13015.21s -> 13022.66s]  No, these guys are all still dead.
[13024.07s -> 13025.67s]  No, he's just not gonna sit down and eat.
[13028.47s -> 13029.27s]  Fuck off, man.
[13029.27s -> 13029.83s]  We're busy.
[13036.73s -> 13037.69s]  Wait, he's moving.
[13038.65s -> 13039.66s]  Okay, hold on.
[13039.66s -> 13040.14s]  He turned.
[13040.70s -> 13046.78s]  Go talk to the nurse.
[13049.80s -> 13050.76s]  Hey, get lost.
[13051.56s -> 13056.74s]  Just kill him?
[13056.74s -> 13057.14s]  I can't.
[13057.78s -> 13058.50s]  I can't kill him.
[13059.30s -> 13062.36s]  All right, well, I'm gonna go turn in this shit.
[13062.36s -> 13062.68s]  Whatever.
[13062.68s -> 13064.44s]  If I can't do all the quests, who cares?
[13065.16s -> 13069.54s]  I can come back.
[13069.54s -> 13075.26s]  So I have the...
[13075.26s -> 13076.54s]  I gotta go talk to Gulag.
[13077.26s -> 13081.59s]  All right, what we got?
[13081.59s -> 13082.79s]  I got at least a few items.
[13083.67s -> 13086.50s]  I've got the PPP stash.
[13087.85s -> 13088.35s]  Got.
[13091.59s -> 13092.31s]  All right, who do I...
[13092.31s -> 13092.63s]  Who...
[13092.63s -> 13093.19s]  Where are you?
[13095.46s -> 13095.96s]  You?
[13096.92s -> 13097.56s]  Hey, Riddick.
[13097.56s -> 13098.52s]  You wanna buy smokes?
[13099.26s -> 13100.22s]  If not, I can't.
[13101.10s -> 13103.45s]  No.
[13103.45s -> 13104.17s]  Get lost.
[13104.17s -> 13104.67s]  Where is he?
[13105.90s -> 13108.62s]  Show me some proof that all the blue skins are gone
[13108.62s -> 13109.98s]  and I'll give you a reward.
[13109.98s -> 13110.48s]  Um...
[13111.26s -> 13111.76s]  Okay.
[13116.28s -> 13117.72s]  I see you in the rain.
[13120.52s -> 13121.02s]  Okay.
[13124.65s -> 13125.61s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[13125.61s -> 13126.81s]  You just made my day.
[13127.53s -> 13128.89s]  Here, take this.
[13130.01s -> 13132.49s]  Ooh, a whole lot of nothing.
[13134.54s -> 13135.04s]  Hey, man.
[13139.69s -> 13140.33s]  Good work.
[13140.33s -> 13141.85s]  I got the money back from Binks.
[13142.41s -> 13143.53s]  Hey, here's a little bonus.
[13144.17s -> 13145.21s]  Now, if you need...
[13145.21s -> 13145.85s]  I don't want any.
[13145.85s -> 13146.57s]  I want money.
[13146.57s -> 13148.09s]  Feel free to ask any time.
[13148.09s -> 13149.37s]  I'll loan you interest free.
[13151.13s -> 13154.36s]  If you need money, feel free to ask any time.
[13154.36s -> 13155.32s]  I'll loan you interest free.
[13155.32s -> 13156.60s]  How about I just don't pay it back?
[13157.83s -> 13160.71s]  Got more than 10, so I don't borrow anything.
[13163.90s -> 13165.02s]  Not interested.
[13165.82s -> 13168.79s]  Okay.
[13168.79s -> 13169.35s]  Well, that's quite...
[13169.35s -> 13170.23s]  What else do I have to turn in?
[13174.01s -> 13174.57s]  Okay.
[13174.57s -> 13175.69s]  Speak to Dogbone.
[13176.65s -> 13179.59s]  Go back to Centurion and he'll start the fight.
[13180.47s -> 13182.95s]  A list from a guard.
[13182.95s -> 13183.45s]  Okay.
[13185.91s -> 13186.63s]  That's that.
[13186.63s -> 13187.43s]  Get drug.
[13187.43s -> 13188.07s]  Okay.
[13188.07s -> 13190.47s]  Two-Tong won't deal unless you do two things for him.
[13190.47s -> 13193.11s]  Get his injector back and defeat the guy in the ring.
[13193.11s -> 13194.15s]  All right, we have the injector.
[13195.27s -> 13196.15s]  Where's Two-Tong?
[13198.52s -> 13199.02s]  I'm good.
[13199.72s -> 13200.22s]  You?
[13202.04s -> 13206.50s]  Two-Tong.
[13206.50s -> 13207.38s]  He's in here, isn't he?
[13208.94s -> 13209.44s]  Hey, look.
[13210.62s -> 13211.42s]  Thanks, dude.
[13212.22s -> 13215.18s]  You don't know how much I needed this.
[13215.18s -> 13216.54s]  Now beat the guy up.
[13216.54s -> 13219.42s]  Now I just need Basim host and we'll have smooth sailing.
[13220.14s -> 13223.18s]  Hey, waste him in the ring for me, would you?
[13224.86s -> 13225.74s]  Oh, shit.
[13227.13s -> 13228.25s]  What, you want to front me?
[13228.89s -> 13229.77s]  I am so ready.
[13229.77s -> 13231.69s]  You want to see the PPPs?
[13233.21s -> 13234.73s]  All right, now I want to fight.
[13235.37s -> 13236.89s]  I want to go back to Centurion.
[13237.85s -> 13241.69s]  It's like I'm seeing the same thing over and over again.
[13242.33s -> 13246.06s]  All right, not this way.
[13246.06s -> 13247.74s]  All right, we got to go back to the tower, right?
[13250.04s -> 13250.68s]  Start the fight.
[13250.68s -> 13253.08s]  I just want to complete all the all the quests.
[13253.72s -> 13270.02s]  All right, not you.
[13270.02s -> 13271.30s]  It's like that first area, right?
[13272.02s -> 13277.59s]  All right, where is he?
[13278.23s -> 13279.69s]  Hour 17.
[13281.05s -> 13282.57s]  Well, he's like, isn't he right here somewhere?
[13283.29s -> 13284.81s]  Where's this guy?
[13285.45s -> 13295.24s]  I think it's this way.
[13295.24s -> 13296.76s]  Say something, cute streamer.
[13301.35s -> 13306.70s]  I'm ready.
[13316.84s -> 13317.34s]  Let's go.
[13330.87s -> 13331.99s]  I know the rules.
[13343.34s -> 13349.02s]  You didn't tell me I couldn't bring a weapon to fight, did you?
[13351.06s -> 13354.18s]  There was no rule that said I couldn't bring a spiked club.
[13355.16s -> 13356.68s]  Redo your rules.
[13356.68s -> 13357.56s]  I'm here to help you.
[13363.90s -> 13367.00s]  Five bucks, and I'll suggest a new fighter.
[13367.00s -> 13369.40s]  You win the show, you're 20 bucks richer.
[13369.40s -> 13372.06s]  Bring me the next one.
[13372.06s -> 13374.47s]  I got a K3 bastard for you to fight next.
[13375.03s -> 13376.15s]  He's called Sawtooth.
[13376.15s -> 13377.35s]  Well, let's go kill this guy.
[13377.35s -> 13378.23s]  Find him in the diner.
[13378.23s -> 13379.27s]  Yeah, let's go kill this guy.
[13379.27s -> 13380.23s]  Yeah, I know who that guy is.
[13380.79s -> 13383.11s]  That guy talked a lot of shit, but he didn't even read the rule book.
[13384.73s -> 13386.97s]  Wait, you mean I could have brought a gun?
[13387.69s -> 13389.05s]  Yep, you're stupid.
[13389.69s -> 13411.18s]  I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to finish it with a parody, too.
[13411.82s -> 13413.98s]  I want to try to I want to bury this thing in his head.
[13425.30s -> 13426.74s]  They still haven't picked that guy up.
[13443.78s -> 13444.34s]  Yep.
[13444.34s -> 13444.98s]  Okay.
[13444.98s -> 13447.86s]  And you I'll see you in the ring.
[13448.50s -> 13450.90s]  So you're really they talk about.
[13452.06s -> 13456.18s]  Yeah, you got yourself a fight.
[13456.90s -> 13458.02s]  You'll see you in the ring.
[13460.60s -> 13460.92s]  Nice.
[13462.04s -> 13462.76s]  All right, let's go.
[13467.18s -> 13469.91s]  It's just Vince McMahon.
[13470.95s -> 13472.47s]  You're gonna rot.
[13474.26s -> 13478.18s]  And by the way, you're far.
[13478.18s -> 13503.91s]  Local streamer stuns the entire McMahon family.
[13511.18s -> 13512.54s]  Okay, bring him on.
[13512.54s -> 13513.98s]  I'm going to just make a bunch of money.
[13513.98s -> 13516.22s]  I'll kill everybody in this prison if I have to.
[13519.37s -> 13519.93s]  All right.
[13521.21s -> 13522.89s]  Keep making them stronger and stronger.
[13525.13s -> 13527.29s]  Nobody knows that they can bring a weapon.
[13528.01s -> 13529.61s]  And there's 16 kills in the circle.
[13529.61s -> 13530.57s]  This guy has a weapon.
[13532.02s -> 13532.66s]  Oh, fuck.
[13532.66s -> 13534.42s]  This guy broke the rules.
[13534.42s -> 13547.26s]  That K three at one.
[13547.90s -> 13549.10s]  I'd have lost money.
[13549.10s -> 13551.03s]  So I believe I owe you one.
[13557.19s -> 13558.95s]  Oh, no, they're getting smarter.
[13562.31s -> 13562.87s]  Like three.
[13562.87s -> 13563.35s]  Wait, give me that.
[13563.35s -> 13563.91s]  Can I pick this up?
[13563.91s -> 13564.47s]  Is it illegal?
[13565.19s -> 13566.04s]  I got it.
[13566.04s -> 13566.28s]  Cool.
[13566.84s -> 13568.71s]  Wait, mine's cooler.
[13568.71s -> 13569.75s]  I like mine.
[13569.75s -> 13572.74s]  Yeah, I like mine.
[13572.74s -> 13574.10s]  Mine looks like a counterstrike knife.
[13574.66s -> 13577.30s]  It looks like I spent a lot of money on that.
[13577.30s -> 13578.42s]  Five bucks.
[13578.50s -> 13580.42s]  And I'll suggest a new fight.
[13580.42s -> 13581.38s]  You win the show.
[13581.38s -> 13582.42s]  You're 20 bucks richer.
[13584.06s -> 13585.50s]  Bring me the next one.
[13585.50s -> 13587.27s]  The competition's getting thin now.
[13587.27s -> 13588.15s]  Ready?
[13588.15s -> 13589.19s]  Only Kusa is left.
[13589.19s -> 13589.91s]  Oh, no.
[13589.91s -> 13592.25s]  And I doubt you're going to be able to take him.
[13592.25s -> 13594.57s]  But if you want to try, he's in the courtyard.
[13594.57s -> 13595.29s]  All right.
[13595.29s -> 13595.93s]  I'll take him.
[13600.12s -> 13600.84s]  Love him.
[13600.84s -> 13602.44s]  You don't think I'm going to club the next guy?
[13606.09s -> 13606.81s]  Don't go near that guy.
[13606.81s -> 13607.53s]  He's going to search me.
[13623.03s -> 13623.72s]  All right.
[13623.72s -> 13624.20s]  What's his name?
[13624.92s -> 13625.40s]  Uso?
[13627.00s -> 13627.48s]  Uso.
[13631.42s -> 13632.22s]  Hey, Kuso.
[13632.86s -> 13633.66s]  I'll see you in the ring.
[13634.46s -> 13635.10s]  Hey, Kuso.
[13635.10s -> 13635.90s]  I'll see you in the ring.
[13636.78s -> 13638.06s]  Hey, Kuso.
[13638.78s -> 13643.56s]  Hey, Kuso.
[13644.20s -> 13644.95s]  I'll...
[13644.95s -> 13645.11s]  Hey.
[13645.99s -> 13646.23s]  Hey.
[13647.70s -> 13648.50s]  Hey, Kuso.
[13650.10s -> 13650.34s]  Wait.
[13650.90s -> 13654.52s]  If you need money, feel free to ask anytime.
[13654.52s -> 13655.80s]  I'll loan you interest free.
[13656.52s -> 13661.11s]  Wait, isn't this the guy that wanted me to complete the quest?
[13661.75s -> 13665.29s]  Hey, Kuso.
[13666.95s -> 13667.99s]  Uso.
[13667.99s -> 13668.47s]  You.
[13668.47s -> 13669.27s]  Are you Kuso?
[13669.83s -> 13670.07s]  No.
[13670.71s -> 13671.03s]  Nice.
[13671.83s -> 13674.09s]  Here's a little thank you from me to you.
[13675.05s -> 13677.29s]  But I do really need a moth, man.
[13677.85s -> 13678.89s]  Can you help me out?
[13678.89s -> 13679.37s]  A moth?
[13679.37s -> 13679.77s]  Please?
[13680.57s -> 13681.45s]  I'll trade with you.
[13682.49s -> 13683.93s]  What does he want me to do?
[13683.93s -> 13685.53s]  Get a moth.
[13685.53s -> 13688.49s]  Just bring me one of those moths and I'll trade with you.
[13688.49s -> 13690.26s]  I actually have to collect one of the bugs?
[13690.26s -> 13691.30s]  I thought I was illegal.
[13692.34s -> 13694.81s]  Hey, you want anything?
[13694.81s -> 13696.14s]  How do you get a bug?
[13696.78s -> 13697.42s]  No.
[13697.42s -> 13699.98s]  Hey, Kuso.
[13700.62s -> 13701.02s]  Ah.
[13701.66s -> 13702.86s]  You want to fight me, huh?
[13703.42s -> 13705.48s]  I'm going to crack your fucking skull.
[13705.48s -> 13707.16s]  Now go back to Centurion.
[13707.16s -> 13708.28s]  I'll see you in the ring.
[13709.08s -> 13709.96s]  Okay.
[13709.96s -> 13710.36s]  Okay.
[13711.32s -> 13712.44s]  Look out for you.
[13712.44s -> 13713.32s]  You're so strong.
[13716.15s -> 13716.39s]  Yeah.
[13716.39s -> 13717.43s]  Oh, look out.
[13717.43s -> 13718.71s]  He's so strong.
[13718.71s -> 13720.23s]  That's what I would be doing right now.
[13720.23s -> 13721.43s]  You'd piss him off so much.
[13722.31s -> 13729.62s]  Wait, put your both hands in the air with your palms facing out
[13729.62s -> 13732.58s]  and kind of shake them back and forth while you lean your shoulders.
[13732.58s -> 13733.78s]  Oh, yeah.
[13733.78s -> 13734.98s]  People fucking hate that.
[13737.62s -> 13738.34s]  Moth, moth.
[13738.34s -> 13739.54s]  Where am I supposed to get one?
[13739.54s -> 13740.74s]  I can't get a moth.
[13741.54s -> 13758.76s]  I'm in violation.
[13758.76s -> 13760.12s]  You see what's happening here?
[13760.12s -> 13760.76s]  I can't do it.
[13761.48s -> 13771.83s]  You have to press Y.
[13794.94s -> 13795.58s]  What?
[13795.58s -> 13798.09s]  What happened?
[13799.30s -> 13799.94s]  I have one.
[13799.94s -> 13800.18s]  I got one.
[13800.18s -> 13800.98s]  How did I get one?
[13800.98s -> 13801.86s]  I didn't even do anything.
[13802.74s -> 13805.13s]  Where is that?
[13805.13s -> 13805.61s]  Where is he?
[13808.54s -> 13809.66s]  It's two tongue, right?
[13814.33s -> 13814.89s]  Two tongue?
[13815.94s -> 13816.66s]  Two tongue.
[13818.97s -> 13819.61s]  Baby.
[13820.57s -> 13822.25s]  That's a fine specimen.
[13823.13s -> 13824.65s]  He's going to smoke a moth.
[13824.65s -> 13825.29s]  Check it out.
[13826.01s -> 13827.45s]  This is what I got for you.
[13827.45s -> 13828.01s]  Something good.
[13828.97s -> 13830.89s]  Buy one bottle of poison.
[13831.45s -> 13833.45s]  Buy three grams of G-Smack.
[13834.94s -> 13836.06s]  Somebody's going to fly.
[13836.62s -> 13837.10s]  I'll take it.
[13837.10s -> 13837.58s]  I'll take it.
[13837.58s -> 13838.14s]  I don't even know what it is.
[13838.14s -> 13838.94s]  Yeah.
[13838.94s -> 13840.38s]  It's the heavy stuff, man.
[13840.94s -> 13843.58s]  Listen, just don't flash it in front of the axe, though.
[13844.30s -> 13845.46s]  All right.
[13846.26s -> 13846.98s]  Check it out.
[13847.62s -> 13849.38s]  This is what I got for you.
[13849.38s -> 13850.50s]  I want poison, too.
[13851.14s -> 13852.18s]  Give me the poison.
[13852.74s -> 13853.30s]  Here you go.
[13854.02s -> 13855.46s]  But I don't ever want to know.
[13856.26s -> 13857.22s]  And I also want...
[13857.38s -> 13858.26s]  I don't have any money.
[13858.26s -> 13859.51s]  Wait.
[13859.51s -> 13860.95s]  Where's the guy that loans money?
[13860.95s -> 13861.51s]  I want...
[13865.51s -> 13866.07s]  Wait.
[13870.55s -> 13872.07s]  Oh, he's doing the thing that says, like,
[13872.07s -> 13873.91s]  hey, man, the game's about to progress.
[13875.27s -> 13877.83s]  You're about to progress in the game, man.
[13877.83s -> 13878.63s]  Get ready.
[13879.99s -> 13889.72s]  Are you sure that you want to move on to the final chapter?
[13890.60s -> 13891.00s]  Club?
[13891.00s -> 13906.38s]  Yeah, I'm going to club him.
[13906.94s -> 13912.44s]  This guy thinks he's going to bring a knife to a crime scene.
[13912.44s -> 13913.88s]  Bring a knife to a club fight.
[13915.27s -> 13917.51s]  Or he might be the reason why he's the strongest opponent
[13917.51s -> 13918.95s]  is because he has a club himself.
[13919.83s -> 13920.84s]  We'll find out.
[13930.14s -> 13931.18s]  So you got your challenge.
[13931.82s -> 13933.74s]  You win, you get 20 UDs.
[13933.74s -> 13935.10s]  Get into the ring, Mr. Riddick.
[13936.81s -> 13938.89s]  Today, we have a fight to remember.
[13938.89s -> 13939.39s]  Okay.
[13939.77s -> 13943.53s]  The unstoppable Riddick against Cusa, the meat grinder.
[13943.53s -> 13945.93s]  Ooh, he's got his own little nickname.
[13960.97s -> 13962.57s]  So you've killed all the best fighters.
[13962.57s -> 13963.77s]  Nobody can beat me.
[13964.49s -> 13965.61s]  Now, there's only one remaining.
[13965.61s -> 13966.41s]  Only one?
[13966.41s -> 13967.21s]  And that's Bam.
[13967.69s -> 13969.34s]  And he's one dangerous-
[13970.38s -> 13971.34s]  What do you mean Bam?
[13972.30s -> 13973.10s]  Where is-
[13973.10s -> 13973.50s]  Where is he?
[13973.50s -> 13974.14s]  Is he down here?
[13974.78s -> 13980.57s]  Where do I find Bam?
[13985.24s -> 13987.38s]  I got a message from Bam.
[13987.38s -> 13988.94s]  He'll fight.
[13988.94s -> 13990.86s]  Problem for me is that you might win.
[13991.42s -> 13993.59s]  And Hoxie ain't going to like that.
[13993.59s -> 13995.75s]  Your problem isn't the Hox.
[13996.31s -> 13997.61s]  It's me.
[13998.33s -> 13999.93s]  Yes, you are a problem.
[13999.93s -> 14000.81s]  I'm a problem.
[14000.81s -> 14002.65s]  Hoxie will probably send Abbott down for you.
[14003.29s -> 14004.17s]  That is, if you win.
[14004.97s -> 14005.69s]  Will he now?
[14005.69s -> 14006.41s]  Abbott and me.
[14007.37s -> 14008.81s]  We have unfinished business.
[14008.81s -> 14009.69s]  Isn't he dead?
[14009.69s -> 14010.81s]  So what's the deal, Riddick?
[14011.37s -> 14012.33s]  You gonna fight or not?
[14013.13s -> 14013.69s]  It's five-
[14013.69s -> 14016.49s]  Didn't I shoot him in the face with a shotgun like ten times?
[14017.29s -> 14018.01s]  I'll fight.
[14018.01s -> 14018.41s]  Let's go.
[14019.37s -> 14026.02s]  Wait, they have to bring this guy down from upper management?
[14026.82s -> 14030.15s]  Does he realize he's about to get fucking clubbed?
[14030.15s -> 14030.47s]  All right, all right, all right.
[14030.47s -> 14032.71s]  I bet this is what you've all been expecting, huh?
[14032.71s -> 14035.10s]  Riddick versus Bam.
[14035.10s -> 14036.22s]  Need I say more?
[14036.86s -> 14039.86s]  You all fight to death!
[14040.42s -> 14043.74s]  Give me the club!
[14069.59s -> 14072.15s]  Okay, it's like-
[14072.15s -> 14076.15s]  That's the shit that you try to avoid at a kid's birthday party.
[14076.15s -> 14078.79s]  When you put the blindfold on him, you give him a big stick and it's like,
[14078.79s -> 14079.99s]  All right, spin him around!
[14079.99s -> 14082.71s]  And the kid just starts fucking swinging.
[14083.59s -> 14084.23s]  Oh, look out!
[14085.27s -> 14086.63s]  He's gonna hit one of the other kids!
[14087.35s -> 14090.04s]  I got a message from Bam.
[14090.04s -> 14092.38s]  He'll fight.
[14092.38s -> 14094.30s]  Problem for me is that you might win.
[14095.02s -> 14095.82s]  Did I win?
[14095.82s -> 14096.70s]  Hoxie ain't gonna like that.
[14096.70s -> 14097.10s]  I know.
[14097.10s -> 14098.62s]  Your problem isn't the Hox.
[14098.62s -> 14099.50s]  Hold on, I gotta settle that.
[14100.46s -> 14101.34s]  It's me.
[14101.34s -> 14102.94s]  I knocked him out of the circle.
[14102.94s -> 14104.06s]  You are a problem.
[14104.06s -> 14106.14s]  Hoxie will probably send Abbott down for you.
[14106.78s -> 14107.66s]  That is, if you win.
[14108.86s -> 14110.38s]  I did knock him out of the circle, though.
[14110.38s -> 14110.94s]  That's true.
[14110.94s -> 14112.62s]  We have unfinished business.
[14112.62s -> 14114.14s]  What's the deal, Riddick?
[14114.14s -> 14115.10s]  You gonna fight or not?
[14116.25s -> 14117.45s]  Of course I'm gonna fight.
[14120.33s -> 14121.21s]  Wait, the turrets-
[14123.83s -> 14125.51s]  I can't handle this much right now.
[14125.51s -> 14127.35s]  All right, the turrets shot him to death.
[14130.41s -> 14131.61s]  All right, let's go club!
[14143.35s -> 14144.39s]  Holy shit, this guy's good.
[14151.75s -> 14153.83s]  He's gonna beat me and have a weapon.
[14153.83s -> 14154.47s]  Don't let him win.
[14155.11s -> 14167.67s]  This guy-
[14167.67s -> 14169.11s]  Well, I feel like this guy should've talked.
[14170.41s -> 14171.13s]  What's happening?
[14172.81s -> 14173.61s]  What's going on?
[14176.01s -> 14177.29s]  Why did that guy not speak?
[14178.25s -> 14180.09s]  They dragged him out here like fucking-
[14182.33s -> 14183.69s]  What's the guy's name from Rocky?
[14185.02s -> 14185.58s]  Drogo?
[14186.30s -> 14188.90s]  He didn't even get to say anything.
[14191.70s -> 14192.82s]  Call Drogo, right?
[14192.82s -> 14193.38s]  No, what was his-
[14193.38s -> 14193.94s]  What's his name?
[14194.74s -> 14197.40s]  Talk to me.
[14197.96s -> 14198.76s]  Ivan Dro-
[14198.76s -> 14200.28s]  Oh, yes, Ivan Drogo.
[14203.85s -> 14205.13s]  Oh shit, a club.
[14205.13s -> 14206.01s]  I know what that is.
[14206.01s -> 14207.29s]  You're not still mad at me.
[14207.29s -> 14209.93s]  Let's see.
[14209.93s -> 14217.83s]  Am I still mad at-
[14217.83s -> 14219.67s]  Ooh.
[14219.67s -> 14220.71s]  No.
[14220.71s -> 14222.87s]  In fact, I'm feeling much better.
[14239.54s -> 14240.90s]  You're a hard ass, Riddick.
[14241.46s -> 14242.98s]  But we're about to soften you up.
[14242.98s -> 14244.66s]  God damn it, this is the nerf one.
[14244.66s -> 14247.14s]  Give me the real one, you fucking asshole.
[14247.14s -> 14247.78s]  Nice prank.
[14248.42s -> 14250.58s]  That is right, Riddick.
[14250.58s -> 14251.54s]  They don't know.
[14251.54s -> 14255.61s]  But you are going to show them.
[14255.61s -> 14257.93s]  There is a fury within you, Riddick.
[14260.22s -> 14261.02s]  Set it free.
[14266.94s -> 14267.44s]  What?
[14268.22s -> 14274.70s]  Okay, he does have superpowers.
[14274.70s -> 14275.50s]  You guys lied to me.
[14275.50s -> 14277.34s]  I thought you guys just said he could see in the dark.
[14278.38s -> 14297.59s]  Why does he look green screened?
[14297.59s -> 14298.71s]  Oh shit, club fight.
[14299.67s -> 14317.61s]  I have to-
[14317.61s -> 14322.28s]  Come on, I need to parry.
[14322.92s -> 14325.51s]  Wait, you can't parry bosses.
[14331.77s -> 14344.12s]  I-
[14344.12s -> 14344.62s]  I win.
[14345.16s -> 14349.86s]  No surveillance means it never happened.
[14349.86s -> 14351.78s]  Wait, do I want my club or his club?
[14359.74s -> 14361.24s]  My club.
[14366.02s -> 14366.74s]  The door is open.
[14368.33s -> 14369.05s]  The door-
[14369.05s -> 14370.09s]  It's an open door.
[14371.45s -> 14372.73s]  What was the point of that?
[14373.29s -> 14383.22s]  This guy keeps coming back.
[14384.38s -> 14385.10s]  Wait, there's a gun.
[14385.66s -> 14390.10s]  There's a gun.
[14390.10s -> 14392.49s]  I saw this-
[14392.49s -> 14393.29s]  No, that was a club.
[14393.29s -> 14394.41s]  All right, this guy keeps coming back.
[14394.41s -> 14395.29s]  So we're going to take him with us.
[14396.17s -> 14400.30s]  I'm not going to let this guy come back for like a third time.
[14401.10s -> 14413.48s]  Come on, get up here.
[14414.20s -> 14422.70s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14422.70s -> 14423.50s]  There's a ride.
[14423.50s -> 14424.30s]  There's a ride over here.
[14424.86s -> 14427.96s]  There's a ride.
[14441.67s -> 14442.87s]  Whoever is editing this-
[14442.87s -> 14443.75s]  I want you to take a second.
[14443.75s -> 14445.35s]  Whoever is editing this video,
[14445.43s -> 14448.15s]  make sure you put in like a roller coaster going down
[14448.15s -> 14455.74s]  with a bunch of people screaming in happiness right there.
[14455.74s -> 14456.54s]  Very important.
[14456.54s -> 14458.66s]  What happened to this guy?
[14458.66s -> 14459.86s]  Oh, wait, this is where I-
[14459.86s -> 14460.36s]  All right.
[14479.51s -> 14480.01s]  Whoa!
[14492.68s -> 14493.08s]  Yes.
[14493.08s -> 14493.88s]  All right, he's still-
[14493.88s -> 14494.38s]  Whatever.
[14494.84s -> 14497.46s]  Because I had this stupid club out.
[14499.98s -> 14500.38s]  Club.
[14500.38s -> 14501.42s]  No club allowed.
[14501.98s -> 14502.94s]  Okay, but what about-
[14502.94s -> 14504.22s]  This is the ultimate test.
[14505.24s -> 14506.36s]  I can't bring my club in there,
[14506.36s -> 14508.20s]  but can I bring this dead body through?
[14515.90s -> 14516.22s]  Nope.
[14516.22s -> 14517.10s]  No clubs allowed.
[14517.82s -> 14519.78s]  Damn it.
[14519.78s -> 14521.14s]  I really thought it was going to happen.
[14521.70s -> 14528.76s]  Your head-
[14528.76s -> 14529.24s]  This isn't-
[14532.57s -> 14534.17s]  No bodies allowed either.
[14534.17s -> 14534.97s]  I have the-
[14534.97s -> 14535.69s]  Put the club away.
[14536.41s -> 14539.07s]  We're good.
[14546.46s -> 14546.96s]  All right.
[14549.34s -> 14550.14s]  All right, well, I'm back-
[14550.14s -> 14551.02s]  I'm just back here.
[14551.02s -> 14551.66s]  I couldn't escape.
[14554.15s -> 14555.27s]  What am I doing back in the prison?
[14555.27s -> 14556.15s]  You know, I just-
[14556.15s -> 14557.03s]  What am I doing back here?
[14557.83s -> 14562.23s]  I could have just got the hell out of here.
[14562.87s -> 14564.76s]  All right, hold on.
[14564.76s -> 14567.96s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14567.96s -> 14569.48s]  Lost his glasses in the mines.
[14569.48s -> 14570.76s]  They might be in the upper mines.
[14570.76s -> 14571.26s]  Okay.
[14572.44s -> 14574.44s]  Let's see all the blue skins dead.
[14574.44s -> 14574.94s]  Okay.
[14576.04s -> 14577.82s]  I have to go down to the mines.
[14577.82s -> 14579.50s]  You've got a special key card from Abbott.
[14579.50s -> 14580.62s]  It ought to open some door
[14580.62s -> 14581.98s]  probably near the work pass.
[14581.98s -> 14582.48s]  Whoa.
[14586.60s -> 14587.10s]  All right.
[14587.72s -> 14595.68s]  I'm seeing a lot of German dot dot dots.
[14596.40s -> 14597.66s]  Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[14597.66s -> 14598.94s]  I was supposed to delete channel points.
[14598.94s -> 14599.66s]  I forgot.
[14599.66s -> 14600.54s]  Thanks for reminding me.
[14601.34s -> 14605.90s]  I need to go to the-
[14606.54s -> 14607.58s]  There's a new guy over there.
[14608.38s -> 14613.52s]  I'm not going over there.
[14622.59s -> 14623.23s]  Hey, Riddick.
[14623.23s -> 14624.75s]  You want to buy smokes?
[14624.75s -> 14625.95s]  You want to buy smokes?
[14626.59s -> 14627.07s]  No.
[14627.07s -> 14627.95s]  I like this guy's voice.
[14628.51s -> 14634.41s]  Oh, well, I see that-
[14634.41s -> 14636.81s]  I see that they have successfully ruined the chat room.
[14638.30s -> 14638.86s]  It's on-
[14638.86s -> 14639.90s]  It's nothing there now.
[14639.90s -> 14641.74s]  It's just unreadable purple text.
[14644.03s -> 14644.75s]  Okay.
[14645.63s -> 14649.52s]  I really wanted to have a nice chat room,
[14650.16s -> 14653.79s]  but I guess that's just not going to be the case.
[14655.00s -> 14655.50s]  Okay.
[14656.04s -> 14664.46s]  Here's the key card.
[14664.94s -> 14666.60s]  Does this guy have anything?
[14666.60s -> 14668.04s]  If you find my glasses-
[14668.04s -> 14669.00s]  Okay, find glasses.
[14670.44s -> 14670.94s]  Go.
[14674.80s -> 14678.88s]  Who is surrendering?
[14694.22s -> 14695.90s]  I don't want that guy to be dead.
[14695.90s -> 14697.10s]  No, I did the Dark Souls.
[14697.10s -> 14698.06s]  It killed me so I can do-
[14698.94s -> 14700.94s]  Just kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me.
[14700.94s -> 14702.22s]  I don't want that guy to die.
[14702.22s -> 14703.98s]  I was going to break his neck, but it didn't work.
[14704.78s -> 14708.70s]  So what happened?
[14708.70s -> 14710.54s]  Access granted, and then he came after me.
[14715.76s -> 14716.24s]  Over here?
[14730.62s -> 14731.26s]  Dude, I just-
[14736.51s -> 14737.39s]  Touch the reactor.
[14747.82s -> 14748.30s]  Okay.
[14748.30s -> 14749.90s]  So, two doors.
[14749.90s -> 14751.82s]  They both have bad guys in them.
[14751.82s -> 14753.79s]  I have to get down to the mines somehow.
[14756.12s -> 14757.80s]  If I open this door, this guy freaks out,
[14757.80s -> 14759.00s]  so I have to go in this one.
[14759.00s -> 14759.50s]  I have to.
[14760.04s -> 14766.35s]  I still have poison.
[14766.35s -> 14767.87s]  I guarantee the people that have them.
[14767.87s -> 14768.75s]  And there's people that-
[14769.47s -> 14771.31s]  There's probably people that have-
[14771.31s -> 14772.11s]  Why is that hard to say?
[14773.07s -> 14774.78s]  That guy's hot.
[14774.78s -> 14776.14s]  You actually saw me through the wall.
[14783.92s -> 14786.88s]  If you find my glasses, give them to me,
[14786.88s -> 14788.56s]  and I will help you in return.
[14793.44s -> 14796.40s]  If you find my glasses, give them to me,
[14796.40s -> 14798.08s]  and I will help you in return.
[14798.80s -> 14802.67s]  Did we fuck it up?
[14802.67s -> 14803.63s]  Are we safe?
[14803.63s -> 14804.35s]  I think we're safe.
[14805.07s -> 14811.04s]  Yeah, are you gonna punch him?
[14813.18s -> 14814.54s]  He's not gonna throw a punch, is he?
[14816.88s -> 14818.00s]  This fucking reset.
[14818.64s -> 14827.84s]  Okay.
[14827.84s -> 14831.21s]  So, should I just run through the door?
[14831.77s -> 14833.05s]  I think who cares?
[14833.77s -> 14839.50s]  I have to stealth.
[14845.82s -> 14846.70s]  Stealth.
[14846.70s -> 14847.50s]  Look, I just-
[14847.50s -> 14848.94s]  I open the door and the guy goes,
[14848.94s -> 14850.06s]  Here's the boxes.
[14850.70s -> 14851.88s]  Where'd he watch?
[14853.07s -> 14854.03s]  I found him.
[14854.03s -> 14873.92s]  Why do these guys all have laser sights on him?
[14875.44s -> 14876.48s]  Do I have to go over here?
[14877.36s -> 14881.56s]  Like, I'm gonna climb up.
[14881.56s -> 14882.36s]  Someone's here.
[14883.08s -> 14884.52s]  How would you even know that?
[14884.52s -> 14885.16s]  How would you know that?
[14885.16s -> 14886.12s]  There's no way you could have known that.
[14886.12s -> 14886.68s]  I didn't do anything.
[14892.94s -> 14893.74s]  Nothing here.
[14908.00s -> 14909.28s]  You're gonna die!
[14909.28s -> 14911.80s]  Wait, give me the gun.
[14911.80s -> 14915.88s]  Give me the gun.
[14915.88s -> 14918.16s]  Use Riddick mode.
[14926.48s -> 14926.72s]  What?
[14926.72s -> 14927.92s]  Didn't I get the DNA for this?
[14928.48s -> 14943.72s]  Wait, vent tool, right?
[14944.80s -> 14945.76s]  I don't know.
[14945.76s -> 14947.55s]  A real Wink?
[14947.55s -> 14948.43s]  It's been disabled.
[14948.43s -> 14948.99s]  It's not there.
[14958.27s -> 14959.23s]  You can't trick me.
[14959.23s -> 14960.51s]  That shit's been disabled.
[14961.87s -> 14962.19s]  Months.
[14962.83s -> 14975.26s]  Wait, why am I on an elevator?
[14976.06s -> 14977.61s]  Oh.
[14977.61s -> 14978.57s]  Did I make it to the mines?
[14979.13s -> 14981.26s]  No, no Winks.
[14981.26s -> 14982.62s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14983.26s -> 14985.56s]  Through the mines.
[14986.91s -> 14987.87s]  Jagger balance.
[14988.59s -> 14990.51s]  Straight to the spaceport.
[14990.51s -> 14991.95s]  I don't have any clothes on.
[14991.95s -> 14992.91s]  I cannot do what you ask.
[14997.74s -> 14998.30s]  Did I get him?
[14999.58s -> 15003.13s]  Holy shit, I got him.
[15004.41s -> 15005.77s]  Ooh, that hurt.
[15006.57s -> 15019.16s]  I need the DNA.
[15019.96s -> 15022.78s]  Okay, this is the Harry Potter ride.
[15023.42s -> 15027.18s]  The exact image of when Voldemort's sitting on the rock
[15027.18s -> 15028.30s]  and there's two or three people.
[15028.30s -> 15029.66s]  It's that ride at Universal.
[15030.38s -> 15031.18s]  You end up coming down.
[15031.18s -> 15032.94s]  You eavesdrop on a conversation they have.
[15034.03s -> 15034.43s]  Right here.
[15034.99s -> 15035.95s]  This exact spot.
[15047.13s -> 15048.01s]  I'm not making a joke.
[15048.01s -> 15049.77s]  That's just a reality.
[15049.77s -> 15051.21s]  I just had to say it because that's what I saw.
[15055.34s -> 15056.38s]  I'm just telling you.
[15056.38s -> 15056.94s]  That's what it is.
[15056.94s -> 15057.90s]  When you go there, you're going to be like,
[15057.90s -> 15058.70s]  oh shit, that's right.
[15062.14s -> 15063.74s]  Okay, I'll enter the correct code.
[15064.30s -> 15065.21s]  Minus two.
[15065.21s -> 15066.33s]  I've never been to Universal.
[15067.13s -> 15068.67s]  All right.
[15069.31s -> 15078.25s]  I was just looking at the fan.
[15088.27s -> 15094.00s]  Come on, stop it.
[15096.56s -> 15111.05s]  I didn't get him.
[15111.69s -> 15114.38s]  I didn't get it.
[15114.38s -> 15115.42s]  Close it, close it, close it.
[15115.42s -> 15116.14s]  Move out of the way.
[15119.80s -> 15120.04s]  What?
[15124.57s -> 15126.16s]  Why is the door closed?
[15131.52s -> 15132.64s]  They forgot I was in here.
[15133.77s -> 15134.65s]  Oh my lord.
[15135.53s -> 15144.12s]  I'm not soft-locked.
[15144.12s -> 15144.52s]  I got it.
[15144.52s -> 15145.80s]  I'll get it right now.
[15145.80s -> 15147.80s]  I don't understand why I can't pick up the rifle.
[15147.80s -> 15151.21s]  You rode the mines through Jagger Balance
[15151.93s -> 15153.37s]  straight to the spaceport.
[15166.36s -> 15170.06s]  Oh, that was pretty cool.
[15170.06s -> 15170.62s]  Let's dump him.
[15171.42s -> 15186.89s]  I don't want me to fall
[15186.89s -> 15189.53s]  and I know everyone thinks that everyone's waiting for...
[15189.53s -> 15191.05s]  I know everyone's waiting for it to happen.
[15191.93s -> 15195.39s]  So I'm just going to stop
[15195.39s -> 15197.23s]  because I know everyone thinks that's what I'm doing
[15197.23s -> 15198.27s]  and I'm not going to give you that.
[15198.27s -> 15198.91s]  I'm not doing it.
[15199.47s -> 15200.35s]  I'm not going to fall off.
[15200.35s -> 15201.47s]  No, that's not what I'm doing.
[15202.11s -> 15218.03s]  What's the point of this?
[15218.03s -> 15225.26s]  Why can't I get up here?
[15225.26s -> 15243.32s]  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[15247.61s -> 15260.97s]  Climb, climb.
[15260.97s -> 15262.25s]  Climb where though?
[15262.25s -> 15264.83s]  On the...
[15264.83s -> 15265.71s]  There's a gun on the bridge.
[15265.71s -> 15266.27s]  I can't pick it up.
[15266.99s -> 15270.20s]  Climb up there?
[15272.25s -> 15282.65s]  No, at least you can.
[15283.21s -> 15288.27s]  There's a door by the lift.
[15288.91s -> 15289.79s]  Is this a door?
[15290.59s -> 15292.32s]  No, this is not what you think it is.
[15292.96s -> 15297.13s]  Can't make that thing go up.
[15297.69s -> 15304.60s]  Just dodge the bullets.
[15311.24s -> 15314.17s]  Grab the gun.
[15314.17s -> 15315.21s]  I can't grab the gun.
[15315.21s -> 15315.93s]  I already tried it.
[15316.57s -> 15320.04s]  There has to be something with this, right?
[15320.76s -> 15322.20s]  I just don't know the code, but...
[15323.24s -> 15324.20s]  Can these be moved?
[15327.55s -> 15328.67s]  Why would they be here like this?
[15329.23s -> 15339.79s]  Can I go up here?
[15340.35s -> 15348.27s]  Flare the guard with some noises?
[15355.44s -> 15356.40s]  I'm just going to go fight them.
[15357.12s -> 15360.08s]  I'm just going to go fight them.
[15374.25s -> 15376.65s]  Give me that gun.
[15378.30s -> 15379.26s]  All right, good.
[15379.34s -> 15381.26s]  Did I really actually have to do that?
[15381.26s -> 15382.06s]  Hey, watch.
[15382.06s -> 15382.62s]  Can't touch it.
[15383.18s -> 15389.79s]  Security checkpoint.
[15390.91s -> 15402.46s]  I really do feel like I should have a gun at this point.
[15403.26s -> 15428.59s]  Is there one of those big things right here?
[15428.59s -> 15430.20s]  There is.
[15430.20s -> 15446.24s]  Dude, why are people saying piss and cock?
[15446.24s -> 15446.80s]  I don't know.
[15446.80s -> 15447.92s]  Why don't you ask them?
[15447.92s -> 15451.80s]  I'm sure you'll get a detailed write-up of why they're doing that.
[15451.80s -> 15453.74s]  All right, so I...
[15454.30s -> 15455.68s]  What am I missing here?
[15455.68s -> 15457.12s]  I can't take any of the lights out.
[15474.83s -> 15476.11s]  Wait, you're talking about me?
[15487.02s -> 15489.82s]  Can we go over to some other block and see if they'll let us in?
[15489.82s -> 15490.86s]  That makes sense.
[15490.86s -> 15493.02s]  Let's meet in the square half an hour after the shift ends.
[15496.41s -> 15497.21s]  All right, now you move.
[15504.25s -> 15504.97s]  Well, he looked at me.
[15505.69s -> 15506.25s]  What was that?
[15506.89s -> 15519.50s]  Okay, well, I'm obviously supposed to be here, but now what?
[15526.40s -> 15527.12s]  Kylo Ren?
[15542.28s -> 15542.60s]  What?
[15542.60s -> 15550.41s]  I feel like Spaghet right now.
[15550.41s -> 15551.69s]  Nothing here.
[15551.69s -> 15552.81s]  Okay, I'm just...
[15553.53s -> 15556.62s]  I can go through there.
[15556.62s -> 15557.90s]  Wait, climb this.
[15568.96s -> 15570.24s]  Is there a light switch in here?
[15570.24s -> 15576.70s]  There has to be, right?
[15576.70s -> 15578.62s]  Where's the light switch?
[15578.62s -> 15581.28s]  Please be behind me.
[15581.28s -> 15582.48s]  Is there a light switch?
[15583.04s -> 15590.32s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[15590.32s -> 15590.48s]  I'm...
[15591.28s -> 15592.08s]  All right, I'm good, I'm good.
[15595.02s -> 15597.10s]  All right, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[15597.10s -> 15598.19s]  I'm going this way.
[15600.91s -> 15604.19s]  Oh, shit, I can back-snipe this guy.
[15611.44s -> 15612.32s]  Oh, my God.
[15612.32s -> 15612.96s]  I need his body.
[15614.40s -> 15615.92s]  No, his body.
[15615.92s -> 15616.72s]  His body.
[15637.74s -> 15639.71s]  One, two, three.
[15645.15s -> 15646.11s]  I would have had it.
[15646.11s -> 15646.43s]  All right.
[15649.40s -> 15650.04s]  I would have had it.
[15650.04s -> 15655.13s]  It would have had it.
[15655.13s -> 15656.17s]  Something quicker, the shift.
[15656.73s -> 15677.98s]  Why would you kick him forward?
[15678.70s -> 15680.30s]  Oh, my God, Riddick.
[15681.66s -> 15682.22s]  That's the...
[15682.22s -> 15683.58s]  Oh, he's stealthy, huh?
[15683.58s -> 15685.98s]  Why would you boot him towards the people?
[15687.40s -> 15689.40s]  That's the stupidest thing you could do.
[15690.36s -> 15704.36s]  So, we're going to not do any weapon.
[15704.36s -> 15706.28s]  We're going to just break his neck with our bare hands.
[15710.60s -> 15711.80s]  Oh, shit.
[15711.80s -> 15712.92s]  No, no, fine.
[15712.92s -> 15718.68s]  Just kill me.
[15718.68s -> 15719.40s]  Kill me.
[15719.40s -> 15720.36s]  Kill me.
[15720.36s -> 15721.32s]  Kill me.
[15721.32s -> 15721.80s]  Kill me.
[15722.52s -> 15723.08s]  Just do it.
[15723.88s -> 15730.91s]  I can't believe it.
[15730.91s -> 15750.89s]  It is kind of Kylo Ren, isn't it?
[15751.45s -> 15756.65s]  Wait, climb up, somebody said?
[15757.29s -> 15759.76s]  Holy shit.
[15759.76s -> 15760.48s]  Climb up.
[15760.48s -> 15761.20s]  It's still dark.
[15762.32s -> 15762.72s]  Nice.
[15762.72s -> 15763.60s]  It's dark over here.
[15764.81s -> 15765.29s]  Now what?
[15765.93s -> 15768.36s]  Now what?
[15771.20s -> 15771.60s]  Can I jump?
[15771.60s -> 15772.24s]  Can I get there?
[15773.20s -> 15777.31s]  Can I grab that?
[15778.03s -> 15788.03s]  The bars.
[15788.03s -> 15789.55s]  Yeah, that's what I was trying to grab.
[15789.55s -> 15790.96s]  I'm going to wait until he turns around.
[15790.96s -> 15791.28s]  Wait, hold on.
[15791.28s -> 15791.68s]  Can I...
[15791.68s -> 15793.98s]  Well, keep looking.
[15812.17s -> 15813.77s]  Trying to do the Batman attack.
[15817.85s -> 15819.21s]  Am I actually supposed to do that?
[15833.26s -> 15834.14s]  Grab the bars.
[15837.44s -> 15838.48s]  There's no prompt, though.
[15838.48s -> 15838.80s]  All right.
[15840.03s -> 15841.55s]  No more hubris.
[15841.55s -> 15842.75s]  No more fucking around.
[15842.75s -> 15843.79s]  No more hubris.
[15845.42s -> 15847.50s]  Just go on the bars.
[15856.92s -> 15858.76s]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[15858.76s -> 15859.24s]  The pit.
[15859.24s -> 15859.56s]  I know.
[15860.30s -> 15861.66s]  I know, I know, I know, I know.
[15861.66s -> 15862.38s]  It's wild.
[15862.38s -> 15863.74s]  Can you believe what this guy Riddick did?
[15864.70s -> 15866.22s]  Yeah, I heard if he takes his glasses off,
[15866.22s -> 15868.62s]  there's a big red ray that shoots out of his eyes.
[15887.18s -> 15887.42s]  What?
[15889.23s -> 15889.39s]  What?
[15889.87s -> 15890.43s]  Wow, what?
[15891.23s -> 15893.64s]  Did I drop?
[15895.88s -> 15897.08s]  Oh my god.
[15904.59s -> 15906.43s]  Everything was so blurry.
[15908.40s -> 15910.16s]  I tried to keep going and he turned around.
[15925.68s -> 15927.12s]  He has to be pretending.
[15928.97s -> 15930.57s]  Adjust your TV screen.
[15944.19s -> 15944.83s]  What happened?
[15957.85s -> 15960.41s]  Oh, who even shot at me?
[15960.41s -> 15961.13s]  I don't...
[15961.13s -> 15961.69s]  This guy?
[15962.57s -> 15968.00s]  Dude, he just ripped through one of his teammates.
[15968.00s -> 15969.36s]  He didn't even give a shit.
[15970.08s -> 15971.44s]  He blew that guy away.
[15971.44s -> 15972.80s]  He fucking murdered him.
[15994.68s -> 16010.56s]  Oh, did he forget?
[16010.56s -> 16011.92s]  Okay, now where?
[16011.92s -> 16015.44s]  Dude, okay.
[16015.44s -> 16018.14s]  I don't understand why it's doing this.
[16021.52s -> 16022.48s]  Press left.
[16022.48s -> 16022.80s]  Left.
[16023.68s -> 16024.00s]  Left.
[16024.96s -> 16026.56s]  I'm forward?
[16026.56s -> 16028.00s]  Okay, that's real dumb.
[16028.72s -> 16029.52s]  Why would they do that?
[16033.32s -> 16034.04s]  It's not left.
[16034.04s -> 16035.16s]  You have to hold up.
[16035.16s -> 16040.25s]  Where the hell am I now?
[16043.23s -> 16045.55s]  Oh no, but what if I cannot see where I'm going?
[16045.55s -> 16046.67s]  I've landed in a vault.
[16047.23s -> 16049.47s]  I get to bring that one back from like 2017.
[16049.47s -> 16053.95s]  But where am I actually though?
[16053.95s -> 16068.62s]  But I could go up, right?
[16068.62s -> 16075.10s]  I'm going to see me up here.
[16075.74s -> 16087.44s]  Is this...
[16087.44s -> 16088.40s]  Oh my god.
[16089.12s -> 16106.16s]  Oh, don't fall in there.
[16106.16s -> 16113.93s]  Was that hard?
[16113.93s -> 16114.81s]  Yeah, it was.
[16114.81s -> 16117.37s]  Because I was trying to press the up.
[16117.37s -> 16119.63s]  You have to press up instead of the left.
[16119.63s -> 16121.15s]  And the whole thing gets blurry.
[16121.15s -> 16130.16s]  Hey, look, this game was made in 2004, okay?
[16130.16s -> 16132.96s]  It doesn't have the same quality of life improvements
[16132.96s -> 16134.32s]  that we have in like 2020.
[16153.12s -> 16154.64s]  You can see me in here?
[16154.64s -> 16164.24s]  There's two.
[16164.94s -> 16165.98s]  Oh, they're not...
[16165.98s -> 16179.77s]  There's a guy in front of me too.
[16179.77s -> 16187.50s]  There's a guy straight ahead.
[16187.50s -> 16187.90s]  Fuck it.
[16187.90s -> 16188.54s]  You know what I mean?
[16188.54s -> 16189.34s]  Just go.
[16189.34s -> 16197.18s]  All right, guy up ahead.
[16197.18s -> 16201.20s]  I need a repair kit thing.
[16201.20s -> 16204.09s]  Should I jump?
[16204.09s -> 16204.73s]  Oh shit.
[16207.52s -> 16208.88s]  Oh my goodness.
[16208.88s -> 16219.31s]  Should I wait for him to...
[16219.31s -> 16221.23s]  All right, I'm going to try to go kill this guy.
[16221.23s -> 16222.43s]  Should I jump down and break his neck?
[16223.93s -> 16225.21s]  He might be the only one on there.
[16225.21s -> 16227.34s]  I think he's the only one down here.
[16227.34s -> 16234.81s]  I thought that was a person.
[16235.37s -> 16236.57s]  Wait, should I go now?
[16236.57s -> 16237.53s]  Should I just go now?
[16238.09s -> 16238.99s]  I don't think I can.
[16239.55s -> 16239.87s]  No, no, no.
[16239.87s -> 16241.15s]  I'm going to wait till he turns.
[16241.15s -> 16244.33s]  This is the loser's point of view.
[16245.13s -> 16245.93s]  What'd you notice?
[16245.93s -> 16247.05s]  You didn't notice anything.
[16247.05s -> 16248.81s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[16248.81s -> 16249.93s]  You noticed what?
[16250.73s -> 16256.52s]  All right, motherfucker.
[16256.52s -> 16257.16s]  I'm done with you.
[16257.88s -> 16258.76s]  I've had it.
[16279.28s -> 16280.08s]  Don't keep looking.
[16280.08s -> 16280.72s]  Okay, there he is.
[16288.70s -> 16289.34s]  Just go?
[16289.34s -> 16290.54s]  You can't just go.
[16291.93s -> 16292.73s]  Do you see?
[16292.73s -> 16293.21s]  What?
[16293.21s -> 16293.77s]  Just go?
[16294.49s -> 16295.37s]  Just go.
[16295.37s -> 16296.57s]  All right, ban that guy for life.
[16312.38s -> 16313.82s]  I can run faster than the bullets.
[16313.82s -> 16314.22s]  Fuck it.
[16329.37s -> 16331.13s]  He's going to ban him for life.
[16334.52s -> 16336.84s]  Hey, don't shine it on my fucking face.
[16336.84s -> 16337.56s]  All right, this guy.
[16337.56s -> 16338.36s]  I got to...
[16338.36s -> 16339.13s]  Holy shit.
[16339.13s -> 16340.33s]  Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
[16340.33s -> 16341.85s]  Get through, get through, get through, get through, get through.
[16349.85s -> 16350.25s]  This is...
[16351.45s -> 16352.57s]  You got to go.
[16352.57s -> 16353.37s]  Are you serious?
[16358.03s -> 16358.99s]  You can do it?
[16358.99s -> 16361.47s]  Well, I need a healing location.
[16362.11s -> 16383.88s]  All right, so there's a guy here.
[16383.88s -> 16384.76s]  There's a guy here.
[16387.44s -> 16389.76s]  This dude right here is a pain in my ass.
[16389.76s -> 16392.24s]  And I can't get out here without him hearing me.
[16392.24s -> 16393.92s]  So, I've got to be very quick about it.
[16393.92s -> 16395.52s]  And I've got to Batman kill this guy.
[16395.52s -> 16396.08s]  Are you ready?
[16401.39s -> 16401.87s]  What?
[16414.06s -> 16419.82s]  That was a tuber reaction.
[16419.82s -> 16420.70s]  No, that was a...
[16420.70s -> 16421.42s]  Sure.
[16421.42s -> 16424.08s]  I was really annoying.
[16424.08s -> 16424.80s]  Whatever it was.
[16427.58s -> 16428.38s]  Oh, fuck.
[16434.08s -> 16435.36s]  Why would you climb that?
[16436.00s -> 16442.20s]  You guys want me to play this on hard.
[16442.20s -> 16443.88s]  Oh, no fucking way.
[16444.52s -> 16467.63s]  Maybe I'm going to go...
[16467.63s -> 16468.91s]  I'm going to make sure I go the other way.
[16479.90s -> 16480.14s]  Okay.
[16482.32s -> 16484.16s]  Am I lit up like a Christmas tree?
[16484.72s -> 16485.42s]  Am I just...
[16486.06s -> 16486.86s]  Am I...
[16486.86s -> 16487.90s]  Can they see my eyes?
[16488.30s -> 16491.45s]  Why can they see me from so far away?
[16491.45s -> 16501.36s]  What's the game plan here?
[16501.36s -> 16505.61s]  Do I have to get out of the window or something?
[16518.27s -> 16518.91s]  Just go.
[16519.71s -> 16520.19s]  Don't...
[16520.19s -> 16521.63s]  Don't listen to them.
[16521.63s -> 16525.18s]  All right.
[16525.18s -> 16525.98s]  Where is this dude?
[16525.98s -> 16526.46s]  There he is.
[16526.46s -> 16527.18s]  Okay.
[16527.18s -> 16529.93s]  I wish I could quietly jump out a fucking window.
[16530.49s -> 16547.53s]  The goal is to get to the other side over here.
[16547.53s -> 16549.15s]  Is he still there?
[16550.11s -> 16550.43s]  Okay.
[16550.43s -> 16551.95s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[16551.95s -> 16553.79s]  What the fuck was that turn?
[16556.60s -> 16558.20s]  That was an instant turn.
[16565.61s -> 16566.33s]  I'm ready.
[16566.33s -> 16566.73s]  Hold on.
[16567.29s -> 16568.59s]  I'm currently invisible.
[16569.15s -> 16571.12s]  But is he still there?
[16572.00s -> 16572.72s]  Oh my...
[16573.76s -> 16574.96s]  The other guy is here now.
[16574.96s -> 16575.20s]  All right.
[16575.20s -> 16576.40s]  This is my opportunity to go.
[16576.40s -> 16576.64s]  Right?
[16586.81s -> 16587.29s]  Fuck off.
[16595.04s -> 16597.28s]  Oh.
[16597.28s -> 16600.04s]  Oh.
[16600.04s -> 16602.41s]  Oh.
[16602.41s -> 16603.13s]  Oh.
[16603.13s -> 16603.69s]  Oh.
[16612.00s -> 16612.96s]  Is that guy facing...
[16612.96s -> 16614.48s]  What direction is he facing?
[16614.48s -> 16617.93s]  Did I save him?
[16618.57s -> 16622.40s]  All right.
[16622.40s -> 16622.88s]  I saved him.
[16637.18s -> 16647.02s]  Okay.
[16647.02s -> 16647.34s]  Thanks.
[16652.48s -> 16653.20s]  Sharpshooter.
[16658.20s -> 16658.76s]  All right.
[16658.76s -> 16660.44s]  There's a sharpshooter guard over here.
[16667.82s -> 16668.78s]  Is that the guy?
[16675.96s -> 16676.20s]  Okay.
[16677.00s -> 16678.76s]  I have to make it past this without dying.
[16680.28s -> 16680.76s]  Wait.
[16680.76s -> 16681.40s]  I don't know what this is.
[16681.40s -> 16681.72s]  Turn it.
[16682.84s -> 16683.16s]  Gas.
[16683.96s -> 16687.02s]  I don't know what I'm gassing.
[16687.74s -> 16690.03s]  I got the card.
[16690.03s -> 16690.27s]  Okay.
[16690.27s -> 16690.51s]  Bye.
[16691.82s -> 16692.06s]  Hey.
[16692.06s -> 16692.38s]  Hey!
[16692.38s -> 16692.62s]  Hey!
[16693.74s -> 16694.38s]  What are you doing?
[16695.10s -> 16697.66s]  What's he fighting me for?
[16697.66s -> 16698.86s]  I didn't do anything.
[16698.86s -> 16716.24s]  What do you mean I aggroed him?
[16716.24s -> 16717.20s]  What are you talking about?
[16729.82s -> 16730.14s]  Wait.
[16730.14s -> 16732.30s]  Didn't I have to club out when I talked to him the first time?
[16733.18s -> 16744.86s]  Okay.
[16744.86s -> 16745.34s]  Cool.
[16745.34s -> 16745.74s]  Now what?
[16746.62s -> 16754.30s]  All right.
[16754.30s -> 16754.94s]  Place your bets.
[16754.94s -> 16757.10s]  Is it going to crush me on the ceiling if I get on this?
[16757.82s -> 16790.14s]  I just had to be sure about it.
[16790.70s -> 16794.27s]  All right.
[16794.27s -> 16794.99s]  I don't think this...
[16794.99s -> 16796.83s]  I really don't think this fall damage in this game.
[16796.83s -> 16797.47s]  I don't think there is.
[16807.26s -> 16807.90s]  Just a little.
[16807.90s -> 16808.14s]  Okay.
[16808.14s -> 16809.02s]  So now from here...
[16817.50s -> 16819.68s]  Lord...
[16819.68s -> 16819.92s]  Oh.
[16820.70s -> 16821.26s]  Right.
[16821.26s -> 16821.58s]  Okay.
[16834.54s -> 16835.10s]  Third floor.
[16835.74s -> 16845.74s]  What's that?
[16845.74s -> 16849.37s]  It can go up even higher.
[16850.01s -> 16852.91s]  Is there anything up here?
[16852.91s -> 16861.61s]  Is it just here for no reason?
[16861.61s -> 16863.76s]  Okay.
[16863.76s -> 16864.40s]  Well, that's dumb.
[16866.25s -> 16867.13s]  Mine entrance.
[16877.82s -> 16883.85s]  Ventilation hatch.
[16889.02s -> 16890.22s]  I think I just used the tool, right?
[16892.73s -> 16893.29s]  Sick.
[16893.29s -> 16900.97s]  What are my thoughts on duck meat?
[16900.97s -> 16902.33s]  I don't really eat it.
[16902.33s -> 16908.51s]  I'm not a big fan.
[16918.76s -> 16925.20s]  What the hell is this for?
[16939.39s -> 16952.00s]  It looks like a half-life map.
[16957.29s -> 16965.08s]  Now where the hell am I?
[16965.48s -> 16965.80s]  All right.
[16965.80s -> 16966.04s]  I'm...
[16967.00s -> 16969.79s]  Is it an elevator?
[16972.06s -> 16972.78s]  Am I getting this?
[16980.33s -> 16999.48s]  Okay.
[16999.48s -> 17001.72s]  Deeper down to the mining core.
[17001.72s -> 17005.50s]  This is not the mining core.
[17006.06s -> 17013.53s]  So why did I go in this vent?
[17013.53s -> 17014.73s]  What the hell did I go in the vent for?
[17015.53s -> 17021.47s]  Is that like a shortcut to get back?
[17039.15s -> 17040.91s]  He could have skipped all of that.
[17043.13s -> 17043.69s]  Hey, James.
[17043.69s -> 17045.13s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[17045.13s -> 17051.74s]  Appreciate it.
[17051.74s -> 17052.30s]  Thank you.
[17052.30s -> 17056.97s]  Well, it saved it again.
[17058.86s -> 17059.18s]  Great.
[17060.83s -> 17061.07s]  Wait.
[17061.07s -> 17062.27s]  There's a person out here.
[17062.27s -> 17063.23s]  Did they not see that?
[17063.23s -> 17065.39s]  He's gonna just fire a gun in the vent at me.
[17066.19s -> 17066.59s]  God.
[17067.47s -> 17074.59s]  This is the worst possible place to be right now.
[17075.79s -> 17076.91s]  I can't get out there.
[17079.13s -> 17080.25s]  This is sitting duck.
[17080.25s -> 17081.21s]  This is the worst.
[17088.25s -> 17089.21s]  I can't even run.
[17090.01s -> 17100.25s]  Okay.
[17100.25s -> 17100.97s]  Well, now I...
[17101.53s -> 17102.97s]  There's a guy here.
[17102.97s -> 17104.94s]  Let's wait for the guy to go by
[17104.94s -> 17107.10s]  so I don't kick the grate in front of him.
[17107.10s -> 17110.98s]  He...
[17111.44s -> 17112.32s]  He heard it.
[17114.41s -> 17115.61s]  He doesn't care.
[17115.61s -> 17115.85s]  All right.
[17115.85s -> 17116.25s]  Where am I?
[17116.25s -> 17116.65s]  Where am I?
[17116.65s -> 17116.97s]  Where am I?
[17116.97s -> 17117.29s]  Where am I?
[17117.29s -> 17117.69s]  Where am I?
[17117.69s -> 17118.41s]  I don't know where I am.
[17118.41s -> 17118.97s]  Where am I?
[17119.53s -> 17120.43s]  Where am I?
[17120.43s -> 17120.75s]  Wait.
[17121.47s -> 17132.70s]  Give me a key card on you.
[17135.76s -> 17135.92s]  I...
[17135.92s -> 17140.96s]  This is new.
[17141.76s -> 17151.39s]  Oh, this sucks.
[17151.39s -> 17151.63s]  Wait.
[17151.63s -> 17151.87s]  There's a...
[17160.88s -> 17162.72s]  Through like another dream tunnel.
[17162.72s -> 17170.11s]  Hell am I going?
[17170.11s -> 17183.56s]  Nothing here.
[17183.56s -> 17186.22s]  Keep looking.
[17186.22s -> 17186.54s]  What?
[17190.46s -> 17191.42s]  I don't know where he is.
[17191.42s -> 17191.90s]  Found him.
[17192.54s -> 17193.26s]  He's up there.
[17194.56s -> 17195.12s]  Oh, I...
[17195.68s -> 17196.64s]  I'm leaning is...
[17198.01s -> 17198.33s]  All right.
[17198.33s -> 17198.81s]  You know what?
[17198.81s -> 17199.13s]  Fuck it.
[17199.13s -> 17200.01s]  I'm going this way.
[17203.64s -> 17204.04s]  Okay.
[17206.35s -> 17206.83s]  What's up?
[17223.07s -> 17223.79s]  Holy shit.
[17223.79s -> 17225.87s]  I ground that guy up.
[17225.87s -> 17226.75s]  I gotta turn the fan off.
[17227.31s -> 17227.55s]  Wait.
[17227.55s -> 17228.03s]  The fan's off.
[17228.03s -> 17229.07s]  There's a body in it.
[17229.07s -> 17237.02s]  Should I go in?
[17237.02s -> 17238.01s]  Okay.
[17238.01s -> 17238.89s]  I'm going in.
[17238.89s -> 17264.20s]  I did it.
[17264.20s -> 17269.47s]  Wait a minute.
[17269.47s -> 17276.54s]  Wait.
[17276.54s -> 17278.88s]  This is the fan the guy was looking...
[17278.88s -> 17280.08s]  Why did that matter?
[17280.08s -> 17283.28s]  Why did that matter?
[17283.28s -> 17288.04s]  I want to turn that fan off.
[17288.04s -> 17289.16s]  Like go in the fan.
[17289.16s -> 17290.04s]  What happened?
[17290.04s -> 17298.17s]  Security check.
[17298.17s -> 17298.49s]  Wait.
[17298.49s -> 17299.37s]  I was already in here.
[17299.93s -> 17314.56s]  Am I fucked?
[17314.56s -> 17314.80s]  Yeah.
[17314.80s -> 17319.12s]  I think I am.
[17319.12s -> 17319.76s]  Just run?
[17321.47s -> 17322.11s]  Wait.
[17322.11s -> 17322.43s]  Did I...
[17322.43s -> 17324.19s]  I went through the entire...
[17324.19s -> 17325.55s]  Was that like the exit?
[17325.55s -> 17327.31s]  You leave and when you're done?
[17327.31s -> 17340.16s]  I can't just go.
[17340.16s -> 17341.60s]  I can't just go.
[17341.68s -> 17342.24s]  I can't.
[17345.60s -> 17346.88s]  Go back to the elevator.
[17346.88s -> 17347.68s]  Okay.
[17347.68s -> 17357.00s]  So go back to the elevator?
[17357.00s -> 17357.80s]  God damn it.
[17362.51s -> 17363.87s]  Where's the elevator from here?
[17365.55s -> 17369.32s]  What the hell am I even doing in the mines in the first place?
[17369.32s -> 17370.60s]  What the hell am I doing here?
[17371.24s -> 17376.94s]  Do I have a code for this?
[17377.50s -> 17382.25s]  Oh fuck you.
[17385.29s -> 17386.33s]  Can I get up there?
[17386.97s -> 17389.50s]  Is there a way I can get up there?
[17389.50s -> 17390.30s]  Like jump up there?
[17390.86s -> 17392.78s]  Because I want to be up there.
[17413.32s -> 17414.84s]  I'm fucking confused as hell.
[17415.64s -> 17422.28s]  It also doesn't feel like that I have...
[17422.28s -> 17424.12s]  It also doesn't help that I feel like I have a concussion.
[17424.12s -> 17424.92s]  When I'm playing this game.
[17442.67s -> 17444.83s]  Star's D&D campaign was cancelled today.
[17444.83s -> 17446.75s]  So I'm going to peel off the sunburn and eat it.
[17447.47s -> 17448.80s]  It's pretty gross dude.
[17451.68s -> 17452.32s]  All right.
[17452.32s -> 17453.04s]  We're back here.
[17453.04s -> 17453.52s]  We're good.
[17456.22s -> 17457.10s]  Didn't I kill this guy?
[17457.82s -> 17466.88s]  Apparently not.
[17468.51s -> 17468.75s]  All right.
[17468.75s -> 17469.47s]  We're back here.
[17470.52s -> 17472.20s]  So now I went up.
[17472.20s -> 17473.64s]  I'm not going to go up in that vent.
[17474.36s -> 17475.16s]  What is over here?
[17475.72s -> 17480.96s]  First thing I need...
[17484.30s -> 17485.82s]  I have to go deeper into the mine.
[17485.82s -> 17487.34s]  Not climb around in vents.
[17488.06s -> 17494.99s]  Go the other way in the vent.
[17498.56s -> 17500.40s]  Yeah people must think I'm really really stupid.
[17500.80s -> 17502.56s]  Because I'm not touching the guns but I can't.
[17503.12s -> 17503.36s]  Okay.
[17503.36s -> 17503.84s]  So that's...
[17503.84s -> 17505.12s]  We're going this way?
[17505.84s -> 17514.94s]  That's just the door.
[17517.02s -> 17520.06s]  I went in that vent right there.
[17520.06s -> 17521.18s]  No this is not right.
[17534.51s -> 17535.31s]  Okay.
[17535.31s -> 17540.32s]  So here we are again.
[17540.32s -> 17541.60s]  Is there another vent?
[17541.60s -> 17542.80s]  Can I climb anything?
[17545.42s -> 17546.38s]  Because there's nothing here.
[17546.94s -> 17550.20s]  There's a tunnel in between the vents.
[17550.20s -> 17550.44s]  Wait.
[17551.40s -> 17551.72s]  Hold on.
[17551.72s -> 17552.60s]  Let me just check this.
[17553.32s -> 17554.76s]  Because I just jumped right in after this.
[17554.76s -> 17555.72s]  Surface panel?
[17555.72s -> 17557.00s]  Oh come on now.
[17557.96s -> 17558.84s]  Come on now.
[17559.48s -> 17577.92s]  I turned off the fan and now he is pretending.
[17578.96s -> 17582.35s]  I don't know how you would like know what to do here.
[17583.23s -> 17591.64s]  Jump up fan?
[17593.55s -> 17594.03s]  No.
[17594.03s -> 17597.55s]  Down the fan.
[17597.55s -> 17600.43s]  No I went down the fan last time and it was a big mistake.
[17600.43s -> 17602.00s]  There's nothing on...
[17602.88s -> 17605.20s]  Wait is there like a vent in the middle of fans or something?
[17605.84s -> 17611.82s]  Is there another way to go up here?
[17615.36s -> 17616.32s]  Use the panel again.
[17616.88s -> 17628.44s]  Go back in the vent.
[17629.08s -> 17633.13s]  Is there another vent that I can go in that's not this one?
[17635.05s -> 17635.93s]  Back through the vent.
[17636.65s -> 17642.22s]  Okay.
[17642.22s -> 17642.62s]  This is...
[17643.42s -> 17646.36s]  There's no other way to go.
[17647.08s -> 17651.00s]  I mean remember I kicked this and I freaked out?
[17651.64s -> 17652.62s]  Wait there's another...
[17654.84s -> 17655.08s]  Wait.
[17655.64s -> 17656.04s]  This is...
[17661.88s -> 17662.92s]  Vent Andy?
[17663.64s -> 17679.88s]  What?
[17679.88s -> 17681.45s]  No this is just...
[17681.45s -> 17681.69s]  I'm...
[17682.25s -> 17684.22s]  This is just where I was.
[17684.22s -> 17685.42s]  I have no idea where to go.
[17685.42s -> 17686.73s]  I don't know what to do.
[17686.73s -> 17698.51s]  You can use the service panel to turn the lights off so you can get past the robot.
[17699.96s -> 17700.92s]  Didn't I just do that?
[17700.92s -> 17701.96s]  I just did that though right?
[17702.52s -> 17705.52s]  Hold on.
[17705.52s -> 17706.40s]  I just did that right?
[17707.04s -> 17708.80s]  So technically...
[17709.28s -> 17709.52s]  I...
[17709.52s -> 17710.56s]  Wait that's a lie.
[17710.56s -> 17710.80s]  Okay.
[17713.55s -> 17714.19s]  Sides dot...
[17714.19s -> 17714.99s]  Hold on there's a guide.
[17714.99s -> 17715.55s]  What does it say?
[17716.11s -> 17717.71s]  Has this been nothing like a screamer or something?
[17717.71s -> 17718.51s]  I'm gonna be pissed if it is.
[17723.20s -> 17723.60s]  Okay.
[17723.60s -> 17724.08s]  Once you're...
[17725.04s -> 17727.12s]  Yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay okay.
[17727.92s -> 17731.39s]  Ignore the door at the end of this hall.
[17731.39s -> 17732.43s]  Go back to the junction.
[17733.31s -> 17735.79s]  Once the guard has been taken care of talk to the inmate.
[17735.79s -> 17738.27s]  Mosley will tell you about a possible way to get into the mines.
[17738.27s -> 17739.07s]  You probably know this by now.
[17739.07s -> 17740.35s]  He's one of the blue skins.
[17740.35s -> 17743.07s]  As a result kill him when you end the conversation.
[17743.07s -> 17745.31s]  This can be done easily by standing behind him and killing him.
[17745.39s -> 17747.55s]  Go back to the junction and choose a door to your left.
[17747.55s -> 17748.67s]  You'll have to be extremely careful here.
[17748.67s -> 17750.67s]  Because his entire court is being controlled by one of the guards.
[17752.57s -> 17752.81s]  Okay.
[17754.24s -> 17754.80s]  Check his body.
[17754.80s -> 17756.80s]  There's a key card on his body.
[17756.80s -> 17758.22s]  All right we're gonna go find Mosley.
[17758.22s -> 17760.30s]  We're gonna go to the door on the left and find the key card.
[17760.30s -> 17761.10s]  Wait I already did that.
[17763.98s -> 17765.26s]  Explore the upper balcony.
[17772.96s -> 17775.36s]  Just watch the ending on YouTube.
[17775.36s -> 17775.60s]  No!
[17776.32s -> 17777.72s]  Where was that guy?
[17778.36s -> 17784.88s]  This doesn't sound anywhere near where I am.
[17785.60s -> 17793.02s]  I'm not gonna watch the ending on YouTube.
[17793.02s -> 17793.98s]  Why would I do that?
[17795.61s -> 17796.73s]  I'm going in the...
[17796.73s -> 17796.97s]  Wait.
[17797.53s -> 17798.25s]  What's this?
[17798.97s -> 17799.45s]  What's that?
[17800.25s -> 17800.65s]  This is...
[17800.65s -> 17801.93s]  I think this is like a vent I can go in.
[17801.93s -> 17802.33s]  Look at this.
[17802.89s -> 17806.43s]  There's two vents?
[17806.43s -> 17806.67s]  No.
[17808.70s -> 17810.30s]  The link was two or three pages.
[17810.30s -> 17810.78s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[17810.78s -> 17811.10s]  Hold on.
[17811.82s -> 17814.28s]  Okay.
[17814.28s -> 17814.68s]  Hold on.
[17814.68s -> 17814.92s]  Okay.
[17814.92s -> 17815.72s]  There's the elevator.
[17825.61s -> 17826.41s]  Oh Jesus.
[17827.31s -> 17827.63s]  This is...
[17828.27s -> 17829.31s]  This is not right.
[17829.95s -> 17834.70s]  Turn around and stand in front of the right elevator shaft.
[17834.70s -> 17837.42s]  Wait for a small platform to appear above you and jump on it when it's close enough.
[17837.42s -> 17839.26s]  You must now wait to be transported to a lower...
[17844.19s -> 17844.51s]  Okay.
[17845.44s -> 17846.88s]  We gotta go back to the elevator.
[17846.88s -> 17847.52s]  I...
[17847.52s -> 17848.32s]  This is all wrong.
[17850.08s -> 17853.36s]  Back to that elevator and go down instead of up.
[17853.36s -> 17859.47s]  All right.
[17859.47s -> 17861.07s]  Where the hell is that elevator from here?
[17865.45s -> 17867.71s]  Power, security, work...
[17867.71s -> 17868.27s]  I don't know.
[17868.91s -> 17871.56s]  Where's that fucking elevator?
[17871.56s -> 17873.16s]  I have no clue where that elevator is.
[17882.01s -> 17882.81s]  Nice map.
[17882.81s -> 17883.69s]  Should I just start over?
[17884.33s -> 17889.52s]  He doesn't know.
[17891.47s -> 17892.99s]  Dump down the fan and go to the elevator.
[17894.30s -> 17895.02s]  All right.
[17895.02s -> 17914.88s]  Are the elevators right here?
[17914.88s -> 17915.84s]  I just have to do this, right?
[17919.53s -> 17920.41s]  What do you...
[17920.41s -> 17920.65s]  What?
[17921.21s -> 17929.12s]  Wait, no, no.
[17929.12s -> 17930.72s]  I have to go this to the...
[17930.72s -> 17931.44s]  Right.
[17931.44s -> 17931.76s]  No.
[17931.76s -> 17932.24s]  Okay, okay.
[17932.24s -> 17932.72s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17932.72s -> 17934.40s]  But wait, does this take me to where I want to go?
[17934.80s -> 17938.89s]  Through the elevator thing?
[17939.45s -> 17941.55s]  This map is kind of a mess.
[17955.28s -> 17955.92s]  Okay.
[17955.92s -> 17959.98s]  Should I use it or should I climb up through the vents?
[17961.29s -> 17961.85s]  You missed it.
[17961.85s -> 17962.73s]  You're going backwards?
[17963.29s -> 17966.40s]  Wait, what?
[17966.40s -> 17967.28s]  Wrong elevator.
[17967.84s -> 17970.64s]  This is the bridge you couldn't get the gun on.
[17970.64s -> 17971.52s]  You were already here.
[17972.08s -> 17973.28s]  I walked past it.
[17973.28s -> 17973.84s]  What do you mean?
[17973.84s -> 17974.08s]  How?
[17974.88s -> 17981.34s]  I can't use this thing.
[17981.98s -> 17992.56s]  You need to go to the elevator that you got squished in.
[17992.56s -> 17993.44s]  Yeah, isn't it...
[17993.44s -> 17996.64s]  Don't I have to go through here though and like stealth to the left and climb up that thing?
[18003.20s -> 18003.92s]  Yeah, that's what I...
[18004.64s -> 18005.28s]  No.
[18005.28s -> 18005.84s]  Yes.
[18005.84s -> 18006.08s]  No.
[18007.36s -> 18008.24s]  He genuinely...
[18008.24s -> 18009.44s]  I have no idea.
[18015.13s -> 18019.53s]  Dude, I'm half blind and every vent is the same vent.
[18020.65s -> 18023.77s]  And if I open this door, this guy instantly kills me.
[18032.01s -> 18033.29s]  No one knows.
[18033.29s -> 18039.44s]  Go up the elevator.
[18039.44s -> 18039.92s]  Go up the...
[18040.80s -> 18044.91s]  Well, this game is really fun until right now.
[18045.47s -> 18051.56s]  So climb up this shit again?
[18070.80s -> 18071.52s]  No, don't.
[18071.52s -> 18072.88s]  You're going the wrong way.
[18074.49s -> 18076.17s]  No, it's just the right way, right?
[18081.98s -> 18083.10s]  Don't go in the vent.
[18092.86s -> 18093.82s]  Just go up.
[18093.82s -> 18102.54s]  Go talk to vent Andy and give him the pack of smokes.
[18102.54s -> 18103.66s]  He gives you a map.
[18104.46s -> 18116.27s]  Go talk to vent Andy.
[18116.99s -> 18122.08s]  This has been such like a mess of going in circles.
[18122.08s -> 18124.08s]  I don't even know where that elevator...
[18124.08s -> 18126.48s]  That one that I jumped on that test squishing his self.
[18126.48s -> 18137.93s]  I don't know where it is.
[18137.93s -> 18138.17s]  Bring...
[18141.64s -> 18142.04s]  All right.
[18142.04s -> 18142.44s]  If it's...
[18144.20s -> 18144.52s]  Why?
[18145.32s -> 18157.32s]  I'm going to go over here and then watch the video of how to beat this.
[18170.17s -> 18173.05s]  Rick roll, but with a different link so people can't memorize it.
[18173.05s -> 18173.85s]  That's hysterical.
[18173.85s -> 18174.17s]  Thank you.
[18195.76s -> 18196.72s]  Turn around?
[18197.36s -> 18217.40s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[18217.40s -> 18218.36s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[18218.36s -> 18219.24s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18219.24s -> 18220.04s]  Where am I?
[18220.04s -> 18224.51s]  Okay.
[18224.51s -> 18224.83s]  All right.
[18224.83s -> 18225.31s]  All right, all right.
[18225.31s -> 18226.11s]  All right, all right, all right.
[18226.11s -> 18227.15s]  Everybody calm down.
[18227.15s -> 18234.00s]  How am I going to get into this vent?
[18234.00s -> 18240.01s]  Go up behind you.
[18240.01s -> 18240.81s]  How am I going to do that?
[18241.53s -> 18245.79s]  Go to the right end of it.
[18245.79s -> 18276.65s]  Oh my God.
[18280.38s -> 18282.60s]  Did I do that on purpose?
[18282.60s -> 18284.12s]  No, I did not.
[18284.12s -> 18287.00s]  I was trying to get the prompt to say to climb in the vent.
[18287.00s -> 18287.72s]  And it wouldn't happen.
[18287.72s -> 18289.96s]  And I can't jump in the fucking thing.
[18290.44s -> 18291.48s]  Oh my God.
[18292.68s -> 18325.98s]  Oh, he's not going to beat the game.
[18328.54s -> 18330.36s]  Well, all right.
[18330.36s -> 18333.72s]  In a game that's about being not able to see anything,
[18333.72s -> 18335.40s]  don't you think you'd want everything to be pretty clear?
[18336.12s -> 18337.64s]  No, shit.
[18337.64s -> 18340.52s]  That's completely the opposite of what we're talking about.
[18340.52s -> 18341.96s]  In a game where you can't see anything.
[18341.96s -> 18342.68s]  Oh, whatever.
[18342.68s -> 18343.56s]  I, it doesn't matter.
[18344.12s -> 18355.04s]  I don't think I can even get over here.
[18357.12s -> 18358.88s]  I'm really not sure I can get over to this.
[18359.44s -> 18361.64s]  Do I have to, can I press like a button?
[18363.24s -> 18364.20s]  You have to jump.
[18364.84s -> 18365.64s]  No, I don't.
[18365.64s -> 18368.89s]  Please tell me you're fucking lying to me.
[18368.89s -> 18369.61s]  You're lying to me.
[18369.61s -> 18370.41s]  I can't believe it.
[18370.41s -> 18371.13s]  I can't do it.
[18371.13s -> 18372.01s]  I can't get in there.
[18372.01s -> 18373.37s]  I'm fucking screwed.
[18377.21s -> 18380.17s]  I have to go through that door where the big guy is
[18380.17s -> 18380.97s]  and sneak over.
[18380.97s -> 18383.29s]  But the guy just has a gun pointed at me.
[18398.65s -> 18399.29s]  You know what?
[18399.29s -> 18416.40s]  Just, just go.
[18416.40s -> 18416.96s]  Holy shit.
[18416.96s -> 18419.12s]  He's finally not, don't turn.
[18419.12s -> 18427.44s]  Don't turn, don't turn, don't turn, don't turn.
[18427.44s -> 18428.08s]  Yeah, that's right.
[18429.68s -> 18435.34s]  Come on over here.
[18435.34s -> 18435.82s]  Come on.
[18435.82s -> 18443.96s]  Why don't you come over here and say that to my face.
[18462.25s -> 18462.49s]  Sick.
[18463.21s -> 18465.88s]  Okay.
[18465.88s -> 18467.16s]  Good, good, good.
[18467.16s -> 18469.02s]  I'm going to finally get there.
[18469.02s -> 18469.90s]  I'm going to finally get there.
[18469.90s -> 18471.02s]  I'm not going to be soft locked anymore.
[18484.70s -> 18489.74s]  Oh, go, go, go forward.
[18501.45s -> 18501.69s]  Okay.
[18501.69s -> 18542.19s]  All right, I did it they do have indecent impression
[18542.81s -> 18554.10s]  Wait, no, there's this part too. Oh, no, remember this part
[18554.10s -> 18562.70s]  How much I hated this shit at least one of these guys has to be they're just in the same spot waiting for me
[18578.18s -> 18584.26s]  Damn it. He's still here. I know you've left probably for a while and I know I progressed but then I
[18584.98s -> 18594.58s]  Soft-locked myself then I had to come back here. Oh, this is gonna be impossible, isn't it? There's two guys just here
[18595.02s -> 18598.91s]  Okay, okay, okay
[18599.35s -> 18602.59s]  Impossible to when they're right there. I can Batman both of them
[18603.23s -> 18615.77s]  They just saw me instantly
[18616.49s -> 18622.73s]  Riddick is the easiest guy to see apparently. It's just really easy to see
[18623.29s -> 18638.86s]  Don't know how he didn't see that that apparently you didn't see me do that
[18639.50s -> 18641.50s]  Shot his own friend in the head
[18642.02s -> 18661.04s]  Thank God. Can you please come over here so I can just melee parry attack you?
[18661.04s -> 18667.76s]  I want to get out of this zone so bad. I can't run for it. He'll kill me
[18668.28s -> 18676.00s]  Now he's running the fuck away. Where is he? It's my opportunity
[18677.16s -> 18695.21s]  Go here. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Give me

[18727.56s -> 18729.56s]  Okay, we have to go down now
[18731.85s -> 18734.27s]  Time for progress game progress game progress
[18741.90s -> 18743.10s]  Jump down
[18743.10s -> 18745.66s]  There's not a whole lot of fall damage, but I don't want to just die
[18746.22s -> 18763.72s]  Oh, I can jump on that bad guy a good guy
[18767.05s -> 18769.05s]  Dolan stay off my heart
[18769.87s -> 18772.03s]  What the hell happened to you?
[18772.03s -> 18773.55s]  Hey
[18773.55s -> 18775.95s]  He had a fucking train gun. All right
[18777.45s -> 18779.45s]  Do you want to buy the gun? Yeah
[18779.85s -> 18784.09s]  I will take the tranquilizer gun 30. Uh, I was just saying 30 quid
[18785.05s -> 18788.67s]  Here you go
[18788.67s -> 18793.55s]  Tranquilizer gun can be used to electroshock enemies. They will recover fairly quickly unless you neutralize them representing right trigger
[18796.43s -> 18799.23s]  Nice. Okay, cool. Now, what the hell does this matter?
[18805.58s -> 18807.82s]  Mining core finally my god
[18808.46s -> 18822.84s]  The air is thick smells of oil machines crushed rock
[18823.96s -> 18825.96s]  Something else
[18826.68s -> 18831.42s]  Yeah, we finally got some progress
[18842.04s -> 18849.13s]  There
[18849.13s -> 18857.26s]  He's screaming he's dead
[18857.82s -> 18867.29s]  Can I get a headshot from down here?
[18870.97s -> 18872.41s]  Oh, I can
[18872.41s -> 18877.02s]  Can I tranquilize the guy in the suit?
[18877.82s -> 18881.18s]  No, I can't
[18881.18s -> 18884.76s]  I can get the gun
[18885.45s -> 18887.05s]  No, you can't
[18887.05s -> 18901.32s]  Why is this guy walking over here? He's walking over here. Why why?
[18902.04s -> 18934.86s]  What do we do about this, dude?
[18937.42s -> 18942.68s]  I can't like smash the thing on his back. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn off the lights turn off the lights
[18944.25s -> 18948.41s]  I thought that just trying to see if I could like smash the thing on his back because it took one shot last time
[18967.69s -> 18970.17s]  Yeah, yep. Yeah body detected
[18972.81s -> 18974.68s]  Yeah

[19080.68s -> 19084.32s]  upper mine
[19084.32s -> 19085.58s]  No
[19085.58s -> 19093.40s]  Hold on. Did I just wait? Did I just go back up?
[19096.81s -> 19100.86s]  I don't want to do that. This is the air. Yeah, this is the same area from last time
[19112.70s -> 19117.10s]  Not using guns no this game does this fun thing that makes it so it electrocutes you if you pick one up
[19119.16s -> 19135.00s]  So what should I go up?
[19135.00s -> 19140.11s]  I was already up here

[19321.39s -> 19326.96s]  It's there was a valve so I pressed the
[19329.23s -> 19331.23s]  Why is everything an explosion?
[19332.64s -> 19342.11s]  That doesn't make any sense
[19342.19s -> 19344.35s]  Is there a tripwire that i'm crossing?
[19364.20s -> 19367.32s]  Valve what the fuck I don't get it
[19381.53s -> 19383.29s]  Why is that there?
[19383.29s -> 19385.29s]  What is it there for?
[19388.17s -> 19390.17s]  You're still alive
[19391.16s -> 19393.16s]  That's just impossible

[19447.34s -> 19448.46s]  watch
[19448.46s -> 19452.54s]  Look look look everyone's screaming at me to open the panel. It doesn't do anything
[19453.60s -> 19456.32s]  Shoot the lights with a tranquilizer gun. It's not gonna do anything
[19457.60s -> 19459.84s]  Why is it electricity turn the lights off?
[19462.44s -> 19464.36s]  Okay, watch
[19464.36s -> 19466.88s]  See
[19466.88s -> 19470.16s]  It doesn't do anything. It just turns off the real defense and I got lied to again. It's okay
[19477.20s -> 19489.71s]  No, I want to deactivate it. Can I climb that?

[19552.17s -> 19559.05s]  I figured that an explosion was going to kill people. It doesn't kill anybody but me i'm the only one it targets
[19559.85s -> 19564.17s]  Even if that guy's standing next to it doesn't do anything. Shut up. I'm talking to people leave me

[20354.61s -> 20356.61s]  Large and vicious ones

[20470.29s -> 20471.49s]  goofy
