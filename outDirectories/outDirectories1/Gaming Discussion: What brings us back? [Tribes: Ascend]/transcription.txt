[0.31s -> 15.82s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Tribes Ascend gameplay commentary.
[15.82s -> 18.82s]  And you're probably wondering right now, you're probably asking yourself,
[18.82s -> 25.06s]  Jerma, we haven't seen a Tribes Ascend video. We haven't even heard of you playing Tribes in, like, five months.
[25.06s -> 28.06s]  What gives? Why are you playing this game? Why are you showing it to us right now?
[28.06s -> 33.06s]  And it is actually the topic of this video to why I'm playing Tribes Ascend.
[33.06s -> 36.37s]  But before we get into that at all, I'm gonna tell you the loadout.
[36.37s -> 40.37s]  Actually, it's only really one different change from the default Pathfinder loadout.
[40.37s -> 45.37s]  Playing as the Pathfinder, like I just said, using the dueling spinfuser.
[45.37s -> 50.37s]  And what this thing does is the more direct you are with your shots, the more damage it's going to do,
[50.37s -> 55.37s]  because it has a smaller splash radius than the typical default spinfuser that you use with the Pathfinder.
[55.37s -> 59.37s]  But anyways, let's talk about what's going on here, why I'm playing the game,
[59.37s -> 65.37s]  why I'm trying to make a case for playing games that you used to play that you've taken breaks from.
[65.37s -> 70.37s]  That's the topic. And it's a very important one, because, well, let me start with Tribes Ascend.
[70.37s -> 75.54s]  Like I said in the beginning of the video, I haven't played Tribes Ascend in, like, four or five months.
[75.54s -> 78.54s]  Something like that. Somewhere at least almost half a year.
[78.54s -> 81.54s]  And when I played Tribes Ascend, I wasn't a huge Tribes guy.
[81.54s -> 84.54s]  I didn't, you know, play it every single day. I wasn't that into it.
[84.54s -> 88.54s]  But it was fun. And I probably dumped, ah, maybe ten hours into it total.
[88.54s -> 91.54s]  Ten to twenty hours tops is how much I put into it.
[91.54s -> 94.90s]  But the point here is, once I stopped playing it,
[94.90s -> 97.90s]  I kind of just let it sit on the shelf for a while, haven't really touched it.
[97.90s -> 104.14s]  Once I took a huge break from that game and came back to it, literally less than two nights ago,
[104.14s -> 108.14s]  this game is like the funnest thing I've ever done in, like, the last six months.
[108.14s -> 111.14s]  Like, it really is. I am in love with this game.
[111.14s -> 114.14s]  And I actually had to make a new account to play it,
[114.14s -> 118.14s]  because I forgot the password, I forgot the email that was associated with the password.
[118.14s -> 120.14s]  So this is a brand new account. Oh, actually, this is,
[120.14s -> 123.14s]  the gameplay you're watching is probably after three or four hours of playing.
[123.14s -> 125.14s]  But that's besides the point.
[125.14s -> 128.14s]  The point is, I don't know what made me want to play this again.
[128.14s -> 132.14s]  And this is the weird psychology of this whole entire video is,
[132.14s -> 136.14s]  why do we do this? And why do we have so much fun doing this?
[136.14s -> 140.14s]  Why do we put games on the shelf for months or years at a time,
[140.14s -> 144.44s]  come back to them, and think it is the best thing that we've ever done?
[144.44s -> 147.44s]  This has happened to me on multiple games, though.
[147.44s -> 151.44s]  You see, you probably saw our video a few weeks ago, maybe a month or two ago,
[151.44s -> 154.44s]  on World of Warcraft, Mists of Pandaria.
[154.44s -> 157.44s]  I have put that game on the shelf so many times,
[157.44s -> 161.44s]  and come back to it, than any other game I've ever played in my life.
[161.44s -> 165.44s]  Same thing with TF2, I've done that a ton with Team Fortress 2.
[165.44s -> 169.44s]  You play it, you think it's fun, you think it's interesting, and then yeah, I'm done playing that.
[169.44s -> 173.44s]  You wait three or four months, you come back to it, and my goodness gracious,
[173.44s -> 176.44s]  like, where was I? Where have I been all my life? This is the best thing ever.
[176.44s -> 179.44s]  I don't know why that happens, but it's something I want to talk to you guys about,
[179.44s -> 183.74s]  something I want to get your opinions on, because I do find it very, very interesting.
[183.74s -> 187.74s]  And it's interesting because why do some games do this to us, and others don't?
[187.74s -> 192.74s]  How come Tribes Ascend is that game? Why now? Why did it bring me back?
[192.74s -> 196.92s]  What turns on in our brains to make us come back and play them again?
[196.92s -> 201.10s]  Now, I'm going to bring up a franchise here that is very, very polarizing.
[201.10s -> 206.10s]  A lot of people don't like it, or you either love it or you hate it, and that's Call of Duty.
[206.10s -> 210.10s]  Now, I'm not going to give an opinion on it. I have a pretty neutral opinion on Call of Duty,
[210.10s -> 214.10s]  so I'm not going to go left or right and say, I hate it or I love it.
[214.10s -> 216.10s]  So let's just bring up the franchise in general.
[216.10s -> 222.34s]  So Call of Duty, like I said, whether you love it or you hate it, has this crazy addiction factor to it,
[222.34s -> 226.34s]  where even the people that don't like the game, people that have a lot of criticism for it,
[226.34s -> 229.34s]  people that really say it's one of the worst, you know, Modern Warfare 3 is so bad,
[229.34s -> 233.34s]  but they continue to play it, and they continue to enjoy themselves in this weird,
[233.34s -> 237.34s]  sort of masochistic addiction factor.
[237.34s -> 242.70s]  And I think it's because of the fast-paced arcade-style action you get in Call of Duty
[242.70s -> 245.70s]  and games like Team Fortress 2 and games like Tribes Ascend.
[245.70s -> 248.70s]  They're very fast-paced. They have a lot of stimulation in their gameplay,
[248.70s -> 253.70s]  where you kill like three or four people, you get like bang, bang, EXP, bang, bang.
[253.70s -> 255.70s]  It's very, very much an addiction.
[255.70s -> 259.70s]  And you can take this argument back to the early 80s, in the mid-80s,
[259.70s -> 262.70s]  when arcade machines were the big thing.
[262.70s -> 265.70s]  And when you had these top leaderboards, scoreboards of points,
[265.70s -> 268.70s]  something like Donkey Kong and somebody putting a quarter in
[268.70s -> 273.70s]  and trying to get to the top of the leaderboards, it has been like that for a long time.
[273.70s -> 278.70s]  And companies have kind of just figured out this way to make us want to put more coins in
[278.70s -> 281.70s]  because we want to get on the top of the leaderboards, and we want to get the unlockables,
[281.70s -> 285.70s]  we want to get the new skins, we want to get all of this cool stuff that the game offers us,
[285.70s -> 288.70s]  but we have to put the time and the money into doing so.
[288.70s -> 292.01s]  And to wrap up the video and bring it full circle, I want to turn it to you guys.
[292.01s -> 297.01s]  And ask you in the comments section below, if you want to, write out your addictions to games,
[297.01s -> 302.01s]  write out your games that you've come back to after a long time that you had a lot of fun with,
[302.01s -> 305.01s]  anything like that, because I like to keep the discussion going,
[305.01s -> 308.01s]  and I want to see what you guys have to say about this.
[308.01s -> 310.01s]  What do you think about game addiction?
[310.01s -> 312.01s]  What do you think about pulling people back into franchises?
[312.01s -> 316.01s]  I'd like to hear everything you guys have to say, and I will join in as well.
[316.01s -> 318.01s]  But that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[318.01s -> 320.01s]  Thank you all so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.
[321.01s -> 323.01s]  And if you want to see more tribes gameplay,
[323.01s -> 326.01s]  then definitely let me know with either a comment or a like or something like that,
[326.01s -> 329.01s]  just so I can gauge if you want to see potentially more of this content.
[329.01s -> 333.01s]  Because I'm down for live streaming this game, I'm down for doing more videos on it,
[333.01s -> 335.01s]  I just want to gauge your guys' reaction to it.
[335.01s -> 338.25s]  So that's going to wrap up the video, thank you all so much for watching,
[338.25s -> 341.25s]  I really do appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all soon.
[341.25s -> 343.25s]  And of course, take care everybody.
