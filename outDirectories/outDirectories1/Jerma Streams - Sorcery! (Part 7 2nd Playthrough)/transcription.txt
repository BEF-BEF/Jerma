[16.89s -> 33.34s]  Hey, Fred. Hey, Fred. Hey, Fred. What's up? How you doing? Welcome back. Hey, Bonnie. Well,
[33.34s -> 50.79s]  you said B-A-R-N. It's Bonnie. B-A-H. If you were going to be Fred replying. Hey, Bonnie. Yeah. I
[50.79s -> 56.09s]  just don't, I don't want to correct you in front of a hundred thousand people, but I'm going to.
[57.35s -> 68.87s]  All right. So today, last time we were live, last time I was live, it's me. Can you do a Gandalf
[68.87s -> 78.89s]  voice? I'm ready to do voices today. I'm ready to do some voices today. The, I was going to play
[78.89s -> 85.13s]  Final Fantasy 16 because I just want to play Final Fantasy 16, but we got really into Sorcery a couple
[85.13s -> 90.55s]  days ago and it's like, all right, I, we left on a cliffhanger. I can't just end it on a cliffhanger
[90.55s -> 96.87s]  like that and maybe not play it for like three weeks. Let's play Sorcery. We're going to chill
[96.87s -> 106.79s]  out. Audiobook Andy is here tonight. I'm going to read this story, go over some of the choices.
[109.93s -> 115.64s]  Why don't you relax? Why don't you get comfortable? We've got some work going on
[115.64s -> 121.00s]  on the second monitor. We've got something going on, something else, killing some time.
[124.54s -> 132.04s]  Or maybe it's time for you to go to sleep. Maybe you're, you know, could be in Europe.
[132.60s -> 140.15s]  I'd be late right now. Turn the volume down. And I really mean that because some of the sounds in
[140.15s -> 146.66s]  this game are loud. All right, so we'll pick up right where we left off. Not much else of an intro.
[146.66s -> 150.26s]  This is a three minute intro. This fastest intro. This is the fastest intro I've ever done.
[155.90s -> 165.74s]  Can we get a recap? Yeah, we'll get a recap. Honestly, we didn't really do that much.
[166.54s -> 177.72s]  We walked in a big circle and I lost a finger. I just did a huge circle, learned two clues about
[177.72s -> 184.10s]  different serpents and then lost a hand or whatever it was. You didn't even need to lose it.
[184.10s -> 190.70s]  Yeah, I know. I feel like I did the same thing last time too. You snorted the horn dust. Oh,
[190.70s -> 197.42s]  yeah, I forgot. I didn't even get out with the horn. Hey, remember you are bald also. Well, no,
[197.42s -> 204.54s]  I'm not. Okay, here's the thing. You can call me, oh my god, he can't even do puzzles. He's a fucking
[204.54s -> 209.98s]  idiot. Oh my god, he's 5'8". I'm taller than him. Oh my god, there's a lot of things that you can
[209.98s -> 216.06s]  say about me that are true. And it's like, whatever, that's fine. I have beautiful hair.
[216.70s -> 224.14s]  It's very healthy. It's, it's luscious. You don't have that on me. You just don't.
[224.70s -> 231.11s]  And I'm almost 40 years old. And this, I don't have a single gray fucking hair on my whole head.
[232.33s -> 239.30s]  It is wondrous what my hair is like. So you can, that's one of the things that I, you can call me,
[239.30s -> 245.61s]  you can say anything about me all you want. You don't touch the hair though, because it's healthy.
[246.65s -> 252.09s]  I'm going to wake up tomorrow and it's going to be receding. And it's going to be such a disaster.
[252.09s -> 256.73s]  I'm going to be like, oh, I'm going to be doing my, you know, washing my face. And I'll go,
[256.73s -> 261.05s]  I'm going to have just pulling clumps out or something. I know. I just going to stop talking
[261.05s -> 271.13s]  about it. I, my hair is very healthy. Every time I go get a haircut, they say the same thing. They
[271.13s -> 277.98s]  go, your hair is really healthy. And I always do the thing. I don't know. Does everybody else
[277.98s -> 282.94s]  do this? But I'm getting a haircut. I kind of be like, yeah, you know, it's thinning. It's thinning.
[282.94s -> 287.90s]  I try my best. You know, it's, it's, it's thinning. I know it's a, I'm losing it. And then they always
[287.90s -> 293.98s]  say the same thing. No, no. What are you talking about? It's, it looks fine. It looks good. It
[293.98s -> 299.83s]  looks healthy. Am I, am I just being lied to or does everybody do that? He's fishing for compliments.
[300.47s -> 306.47s]  Now I genuinely kind of feel, I don't know, because when my hair is really wet,
[307.56s -> 314.90s]  it's really obvious that it's receding. I'm also one of those people that never knows what haircut
[314.90s -> 321.96s]  they're getting. As a 37 year old, I'll sit down in that chair. Cause sometimes it's, it's a while
[323.46s -> 329.16s]  and it's like, what, what do you want to do? And I'm just like, ah, I don't know. I have no idea.
[330.10s -> 336.02s]  It's like, oh, do you want to take some off? No, I want to leave the length. Okay. Do you want to
[336.66s -> 345.80s]  take up some of the back or the sides? Yes. How much? Um, can you just, you just do it with
[345.80s -> 350.60s]  scissors first and then we'll figure it out. It's like, okay. And then it's always just with scissors
[350.60s -> 359.77s]  and I never go any further. Can you just trim? Why are you, why are you going? Cause you got to
[359.77s -> 363.37s]  clean it up. You can't just let your, even if you grow your hair out, those of you that have
[363.37s -> 369.11s]  grown your hair out long, you know, you've got to clean up the ends and shape it. So it grows out
[369.11s -> 373.75s]  and makes grows onto your head and makes it look, you can't just have it. You cannot just
[373.75s -> 377.43s]  let your hair grow completely wild without cleaning it up. If you want to have it, you know, fall on
[377.43s -> 389.58s]  your head and shoulders correctly. Is this a PR stunt? Me telling you that I've, I sit in the,
[389.58s -> 398.06s]  what do you mean PR? A PR stunt would be if I turn the face cam on right now and I was completely
[398.06s -> 408.34s]  bald with like a completely shaved with like a Gillette razor. And I started just ranting
[409.14s -> 415.80s]  about hair or something, but no, this is just me talking. Is that what's going to happen?
[416.44s -> 437.10s]  Shave your eyebrows off. No. Is he actually bald? Okay. I just said a brand name. That doesn't mean
[437.10s -> 450.04s]  I, I just was talking about the, I said, Oh, I said a brand's name. All right. Are you ready?
[450.04s -> 457.98s]  You guys ready to play? We, enough people trickled in. I know the sorcery streams aren't necessarily
[457.98s -> 462.70s]  for everybody, but they're for me. So I'm having a good time. And there you go. That's all I have to
[462.70s -> 474.01s]  say face cam. No, no face cam ever for sorcery. It takes the immersion out. You end up being able
[474.01s -> 478.81s]  to just the reason. Okay. Here's the reason why I don't want face cam on during sorcery streams
[479.45s -> 485.05s]  because you know, the behind the scenes videos of the actors reading the script in the studio
[485.05s -> 491.58s]  with all the soundproofing around the walls. Imagine if that was in the corner on every episode
[491.58s -> 498.36s]  of Spongebob. I don't, I think you'd be like, I, there's a, there's a guy in the corner.
[500.63s -> 507.75s]  I just, I want, I want Spongebob on the screen. That would be sick. Yeah. It'd be cool for a,
[507.75s -> 514.31s]  but like, but then it's not like Spongebob talking. It's, I have a live cam of the actor doing
[514.31s -> 520.31s]  Spongebob. Let's just use that as an example. It's just Spongebob is talking, but also Spongebob,
[520.31s -> 527.54s]  the actor is talking. You know what I mean? This is a bad take. I don't think it is.
[530.49s -> 535.35s]  I, I don't think this is a bad take. I mean, for a behind the scenes video,
[535.91s -> 539.51s]  that makes perfect sense to me. That's really cool. I love that stuff, but I don't want that
[539.51s -> 548.15s]  like on the episode. He's right. He's right. He's right. Yeah. Thank you. One guy, Spongebob,
[548.15s -> 567.45s]  the author, Spongebob, the author. Are you our Spongebob? No, that's, I'm not, I'm not,
[567.45s -> 576.39s]  I'm not, I'm not, no, I'm sorry. I ain't anybody's anything. Okay. Let's get that real clear.
[584.25s -> 595.30s]  You turned into Spongebob for you. You're doing Spongebob for PR right now. You rejected our,
[595.30s -> 604.52s]  in quotes, not Spongebob in quotes. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, it's very, very, that was very clear.
[605.24s -> 612.81s]  This is the shortest intro I've ever done. Yeah. Well, whatever. Sorcery crew is here. And you
[612.81s -> 628.65s]  know, this is, we're good. This is the sorcery crew. I can be way more candid with the sorcery
[628.65s -> 632.17s]  crew. You know what I mean? Like I can be, I can talk to you guys. I can talk to you guys.
[632.17s -> 642.04s]  That's what you guys, you guys get it. Except almost 90% of the chat is contradicting everything
[642.04s -> 653.90s]  I'm saying. So maybe I can't trust the sorcery crew as much as I thought I could. Hmm. Are you
[653.90s -> 667.75s]  high right now? No. Are you? Are you? All right. Here comes some wind. All right. So let's do a
[667.75s -> 677.26s]  recap. This is where we were. This is where we left off. Hello. Welcome back. So we are right
[677.26s -> 690.63s]  outside this looks like a some kind of dwelling. Let's go. Let's freaking go. It's a sorcery stream
[690.63s -> 696.73s]  of course. Well, whatever. That's a, that's between you. It's between you and God. And you know,
[696.73s -> 711.62s]  obviously the legality of the state or county that you're currently in. I was talking about,
[711.62s -> 721.66s]  somebody said they were smoking weed. I'm not in the US. Can we get a recap? All right. So here's
[721.66s -> 730.25s]  a recap from a couple days ago. We started here. I went over, I went to the bridge. I actually,
[730.25s -> 737.34s]  actually where did we start? We started here. Okay. Yeah. So I went over the bridge. I climbed
[737.34s -> 745.54s]  down it. I fell off. I broke both of my legs. I got fixed. I went backwards. Tried to cross
[745.54s -> 752.34s]  the bridge normally. Lost a finger to the toll. Went up through here. Decided I could not go any
[752.34s -> 757.06s]  further. Went through here into this town. This town was pretty interesting. They told us about
[757.06s -> 765.13s]  a mine that was a tunnel that was essentially very dangerous. Went through that. Did not pick up any
[765.13s -> 772.07s]  of the items. Did not talk to the dog that was in here. But we made it out alive and with full
[772.07s -> 779.37s]  health, which is a huge deal. And four rations. Made it through here. Got to this point. We fought
[779.37s -> 791.48s]  a couple of Snatacats. But I lost a finger here. So we have made our way through. We went to the
[791.48s -> 801.14s]  forest of Snata. We did find this lake. I snorted a mushroom and passed out face first into the water
[801.14s -> 807.58s]  and had a bunch of hallucinations and a bat saved my life. That was pretty interesting. And then we
[807.58s -> 813.99s]  walked up here. Ended up in the north side of the forest of Snata. Leading us to here. Which this is
[814.31s -> 823.91s]  sort of some kind of house or hut in the woods. And we can go knock on the door. Remember,
[823.91s -> 832.26s]  recap. We are trying to hunt down the seven Serpents. We do not get rid of the seven Serpents
[832.26s -> 838.89s]  if we don't stop them. They will tell the Archmage that we are coming. We don't want that to be a
[838.89s -> 847.85s]  thing. We want to stop the seven Serpents with our various quests. And when we do those quests,
[847.85s -> 855.66s]  we will complete those quests. It'll be good to go to episode four. You mean six? Yes, that's
[855.66s -> 863.59s]  right. Six are dead. No, six are alive. Wait, what are you asking? One is dead. Six are alive.
[863.59s -> 872.36s]  Let's go knock on the door. Okay. The door is made of heavy wood carved with various runes and
[872.36s -> 881.96s]  symbols in a language you do not know. Do I just open this? Oh yeah. Mind your volume tonight.
[882.52s -> 890.34s]  The like, yeah, see it's a little loud in some places, but one of the spells to open any door
[890.34s -> 894.82s]  is stop opens locks and doors. The door might just be open. This might be a waste of time. I
[894.82s -> 901.38s]  have a lot of stamina. I could throw a grenade at the door. Wait, what? Didn't I get a pebble?
[901.94s -> 920.74s]  What happened to my pebble? I got pebbles. It was too hot. You dropped it. What? Oh, it was.
[921.46s -> 928.62s]  I could see. Oh, I could read minds. All right. I wonder if I can put, because I have, if I put
[928.62s -> 939.54s]  the skull cap on and see if I can read somebody's mind. I mean, it doesn't cost any stamina. I could
[939.54s -> 947.10s]  just do it. Let's see. You turn the stars into shape around you, pulling on the cloth skull cap
[947.10s -> 953.19s]  as the magic takes hold, but you are alone. So there are no thoughts to hear. What if I just
[953.19s -> 958.66s]  open the door? You tried the door. It is not locked. A dark passageway is revealed. All right.
[958.66s -> 964.14s]  So we would just open the door. I probably should have knocked, but we're already here.
[967.14s -> 972.10s]  The door opens through a short, dark hallway, descends into the hill. This is a tomb. You begin
[972.10s -> 983.59s]  to see a glowing light ahead and hear a voice muttering low, angry curses. Make a move. A little
[983.59s -> 995.46s]  sunshine falls through the doorway. There's still time to turn back. We're just going in. You keep
[995.46s -> 1000.50s]  moving forwards and the passage quickly opens up. You enter a small room lit by a single candle on
[1000.50s -> 1006.02s]  a wooden table. Seated at the table is a spindly creature whose attention is focused on a glass
[1006.02s -> 1018.78s]  orb set on a plinth. We should take that. Let's watch. Oh, I think I remember this.
[1021.08s -> 1025.40s]  You watch as the creature stares into their orb, which swirls with colors and shapes.
[1025.40s -> 1034.66s]  It mumbles something quietly. Announce myself. You open your mouth to announce yourself,
[1034.66s -> 1040.66s]  but the silence is broken by a squeaky voice. Yes, yes, yes. All right. Don't stare like a half
[1040.66s -> 1055.58s]  orc. I'm busy. Sit down. Thin finger gestures towards a chair in the corner. What can I even
[1055.58s -> 1067.86s]  do here? I could do nap cause sleepiness. I don't have pendulum. Uh, that's it. I could read minds
[1067.86s -> 1075.90s]  in here. This is going to be weird. Me holding like two fingers up, like, uh, X-Men style.
[1078.30s -> 1091.05s]  This also is, what's L? This is law. Law is controlled, non-intelligent creatures.
[1093.05s -> 1096.57s]  I feel like this, this, I feel like there's intelligence here though.
[1099.90s -> 1113.30s]  Mud. Oh, we just, I could make quicksand. I have sand. Do I just make a just giant
[1113.30s -> 1119.69s]  death trap in the middle of this person's house? Why would you do that though?
[1120.25s -> 1130.92s]  I don't know. Oh, this could be a sorceress. It could be a sorcerer. I don't know.
[1130.92s -> 1135.30s]  Let's talk. I'll sit down. Sit. You sit down as instructed. After a few minutes,
[1135.30s -> 1147.06s]  the creature leans back from her orb and looks up at you. So a visitor, a human too. Greetings.
[1147.06s -> 1153.21s]  Greetings to you indeed. As the light from the glass orb fades a little, you see this speaker
[1153.21s -> 1164.71s]  is a woman, some kind of elf, though she appears somewhat disfigured. What is your name? Finestra.
[1164.71s -> 1171.16s]  Now human, as my time is more precious than yours, I will soon lose my patience with you.
[1171.16s -> 1176.46s]  What in Gred's name are you doing in this miserable fortress? Forest is not a fortress
[1176.46s -> 1187.32s]  anywhere to be found. That's in Mampang. Uh, I don't think you just, I don't think you put
[1187.32s -> 1197.64s]  all your cards on the table. I'm looking for seven serpents. Uh, I'm going to Lake Iklala.
[1197.64s -> 1203.50s]  I'm going to Lake Iklala. You tell her, cautious not to reveal your true purpose to this stranger.
[1203.50s -> 1211.02s]  She nods. It can be hard to cross the lake. There's only one ferryman and he is old now.
[1213.24s -> 1222.95s]  I have a whistle which you may use to summon him if you wish. Thank you. It's not free. I will charge
[1223.03s -> 1237.19s]  you five gold pieces. I don't have that much. Shake my head. Just, no. Trey Pang 2 released?
[1237.19s -> 1248.34s]  What the fuck? Oh, cool. I'll play it. Uh, let's haggle. I will give you three. Okay, very well then.
[1248.34s -> 1255.29s]  Agreed. You hand over the money and she places the whistle into your hand. How does it work?
[1255.29s -> 1262.39s]  You put it up to your lips and blow. There is nothing magic about it. It's just a whistle.
[1262.39s -> 1273.43s]  If the ferryman is about, and he is most mornings, then he will hear you and come. You stash the
[1273.43s -> 1280.12s]  whistle away without further comment. The orb on her table swirls with color ever more violently.
[1280.12s -> 1288.82s]  Benestra sits up sharply. You must go. I have work that must be attended to. What do you see
[1288.82s -> 1301.26s]  in the orb? You ask. See for yourself. Pointing into the glass. Shapes swirl inside the crystal.
[1301.26s -> 1314.98s]  Should I look into the orb or don't look? Look into the orb. You peer into the orb and then your
[1314.98s -> 1324.22s]  jaw begins to drop. For inside the glass is a winged serpent. It is the Sun Serpent. The one
[1324.22s -> 1330.39s]  called Flanker helped me to trap it. I lured it down from the skies using a rain spell and offered
[1330.39s -> 1338.89s]  it shelter. But the Sun Serpent cannot tolerate water of course. And then he trapped it. I know
[1338.89s -> 1350.79s]  Flanker. I know Flanker well. This poor creature despises him. Don't you? She taps on the glass
[1350.79s -> 1361.59s]  and the serpent lunges uselessly against the glass in reply. Why not kill it? The Sun Serpent
[1361.59s -> 1368.42s]  is the mate of the Water Serpent. They have a doomed, impossible love. It is enough for me
[1368.42s -> 1379.96s]  to lure the beast. And when it comes, I will kill them both. But the creature might escape.
[1379.96s -> 1389.32s]  We must destroy it for good. Be warned, Annalander. This serpent will reach into your mind and control
[1389.32s -> 1401.59s]  your will if you allow it. It would do anything to be free. I gotta smash it. Smash it. Take it.
[1401.59s -> 1422.97s]  Smash it. Look into it. What can I do here? Zap. Boom! Out of the finger. Same joke. Same joke. Same
[1422.97s -> 1431.43s]  joke. From 2016. Same joke. From 2016. Are we going same joke, Andy? Is that what we're doing?
[1431.43s -> 1448.34s]  Like eight years later? No. I'm going to, I'm going to read her mind. You place the skull cap
[1448.34s -> 1451.78s]  on your head as if you craft the spell. You hear the serpent's thoughts enter your mind.
[1452.60s -> 1460.47s]  It is swirling in anger around cursing Fenestra and you. Oh, I can't get the fuck out of here.
[1462.33s -> 1473.42s]  Okay. I don't know what to, what's the, I don't know what the, there's no right answer in this
[1473.42s -> 1484.66s]  game, but I wonder what the path of least problems is. If I look into it, will he like control me?
[1484.66s -> 1491.58s]  Take it. Take the orb. There's no way this orb can hold the creature and should it escape,
[1491.58s -> 1498.04s]  your mission will be revealed. The orb must come with me. The fate of the land is at stake.
[1498.04s -> 1508.87s]  You may take it and return for two promises. No. First, that you will destroy this orb and
[1509.03s -> 1513.98s]  the snake inside in such a fashion that they cannot return. Know that breaking the glass
[1513.98s -> 1522.20s]  will set it free. So be sure you do not do that. I shall drop it into a canyon.
[1523.46s -> 1531.66s]  That sounds like a good plan. I will bury it. I shall drop it into a lake. And what is the second
[1531.66s -> 1540.20s]  thing? You nod understanding. The second thing is more important. Find the water serpent in Lake
[1540.20s -> 1547.34s]  Lala and do not leave it alive and do not die in the attempt to kill it. Will you do that for me?
[1547.34s -> 1559.58s]  I shall do my best. I shall. Wow. Oh no. I shall. You vow. Then with a nod, she steps aside and
[1559.58s -> 1565.85s]  lets you take the orb with the trapped serpent inside. It will not serve you for the casting of
[1565.85s -> 1575.48s]  far. The serpent will not allow it. I have an orb of my own already. You too. I have an orb of my
[1575.48s -> 1583.24s]  own already too. Well then we both own orbs. Yes we do. Then I'm going to put the strange orb carefully
[1583.24s -> 1593.88s]  into my pack. You turn on your heel and leave the underground room. So let me get this burn into
[1593.88s -> 1603.24s]  memory here. I can't break this. If I break this it will come out and that's bad. There is a serpent
[1603.24s -> 1613.38s]  in the glass cube. I need to make sure I destroy it. The water serpent and the sun serpent know
[1613.38s -> 1628.97s]  each other very well. So we have to destroy it somehow. Okay. You got it. Well let's head there
[1628.97s -> 1638.97s]  now. Yeah I think we- here's the plan. Ready? Streamer's Choice. Streamer Vito coming in here.
[1638.97s -> 1645.30s]  We're going to go down here. Stop by whatever this little hut is. And by the way get Elden Ringed.
[1645.30s -> 1655.93s]  For those of you that just got here. Yeah. You get a problem? All right so I'm going to go this way.
[1655.93s -> 1664.87s]  I'm going to go down. Cringe. Is the story in Sorcery the same every time? It is. The- the A
[1664.87s -> 1677.14s]  and the Z are always exactly the same. And honestly so is- so is like the LMNOP is usually
[1677.14s -> 1683.56s]  kind of the same like throughout as well. But everything else is kind of your- on your own.
[1683.56s -> 1689.98s]  But I mean well it really depends. Everybody's goal is exactly the same. You're the Annalander.
[1689.98s -> 1694.38s]  You're trying to go get the Crown of Kings that was stolen from you and the Crown of Kings is
[1694.38s -> 1700.90s]  the Infinity Gauntlet. It's like the god power. It literally makes you unstoppable. You're unbeatable.
[1700.90s -> 1708.84s]  And the Archmage has it. The Archmage is evil. You're back in the sunshine of the clearing.
[1708.84s -> 1715.62s]  You feel the serpent in your bag and angry as it senses the heat and light around. You have the
[1715.62s -> 1722.42s]  sense that things are watching you from the trees. It's time to move. All right so I want to go down
[1722.42s -> 1729.78s]  because going back wrapping around left is not a good idea. So we're going to go this way. A wide
[1729.78s -> 1735.42s]  track leads away from the door into the trees. And here we go. So we're going to stop here.
[1735.42s -> 1742.36s]  See what this is. The goal is to eventually before Stream ends today to go get the Water Serpent.
[1742.36s -> 1748.79s]  And you're probably asking yourself bro it's like right here. Yeah okay yep it is right there. See
[1748.79s -> 1756.18s]  you in like four hours because it's good. That's how long it's going to take us to get over there.
[1756.18s -> 1769.48s]  The heckin Infinity Gauntlet? Yep. I just spilled all over me. Hold on a second. Okay if I got like
[1769.48s -> 1776.25s]  a huge replica Infinity Gauntlet and just like put it on and turned the cam full cam and just
[1776.25s -> 1781.75s]  started just played the like Avengers theme song. How long do you think we could keep that up?
[1781.75s -> 1788.38s]  Where I was like yeah no it's like holding it up into the camera and stuff. How long do you think
[1788.38s -> 1801.00s]  that could go on for? Do you think more than 10 minutes straight of that would be unfair before
[1801.00s -> 1809.11s]  a DMCA? Before you laugh 10 seconds? No no no no I would get in character. You guys there okay there's
[1809.11s -> 1814.06s]  two different ways that I operate on Stream. There's like I'm into this and I'm dedicating
[1814.06s -> 1820.60s]  into my mind. I'm an actor and I am I will you can't break me. You never will. But then there's
[1820.76s -> 1832.34s]  I'm just hanging out and I laugh in five seconds. Which one of them will it be? I mean if I treat it
[1832.34s -> 1838.84s]  like it's a you know like a character or something then it should be easy. It's gonna be so hard though.
[1839.72s -> 1849.11s]  You have to be committed. What's this worth to you guys? That's what I want to know.
[1849.83s -> 1863.11s]  What is a 10 straight minute Infinity Gauntlet pog stream worth to you? And no laughing. I can't
[1863.11s -> 1867.91s]  make any sounds. I have to just be excited and going over all the stones and what they do and
[1867.91s -> 1872.15s]  shit and like aiming it at that camera and like holding it up and doing like the two fingers like
[1872.15s -> 1877.74s]  I'm gonna snap and stuff. Was it worth you? Because that's it that is 10 straight minutes
[1877.74s -> 1883.35s]  of embarrassing myself in front of millions of potential people. What's it worth? You should
[1883.35s -> 1899.18s]  paint yourself purple. I'd rather you don't do that. Yeah put up a paid poll for bits. He
[1899.66s -> 1910.22s]  he's gonna do it or he won't do it. What's it worth to you? That's actually kind of funny.
[1910.22s -> 1916.22s]  I would pay to have you not do that. I would pay to have you do that. Have like a fucking money
[1916.22s -> 1924.46s]  fight to have the 40 year old clown either put on the Infinity Gauntlet or not. What a strange time
[1924.46s -> 1930.58s]  we live in. Don't you think? I think these are very strange times. These are very interesting times.
[1930.58s -> 1942.54s]  It's very odd. All right let's keep going. No no no don't actually do it. Don't actually do it.
[1942.54s -> 1949.75s]  Did you actually do it? Okay yeah I don't I don't no we're not doing that. I'm saying it's
[1949.75s -> 1965.10s]  really funny but okay it's just a regular poll okay. Somebody okay if I do a paid version somebody
[1965.10s -> 1971.03s]  is just gonna be like you know what? I got a lot of fucking money in my account and I'm making sure
[1971.03s -> 1977.99s]  this motherfucker does not do that. There'll be one like thousand dollar drop or something
[1977.99s -> 1987.56s]  to just ruin everything. That's why I don't want to do it. Please change your wallpaper. I like that
[1987.56s -> 1996.25s]  wallpaper. It reminds me of going to the beach. It's a beach right? Yes it is. It reminds me of
[1996.25s -> 2005.80s]  going to the beach and I like the beach. I've been described as beachy. I've been described as beachy.
[2005.80s -> 2018.71s]  So I have like a beach aesthetic. I like the beach. I've been described as very beachy.
[2020.07s -> 2026.22s]  I've been described as enjoying the beach a lot is what I'm trying to say. The path winds
[2026.22s -> 2032.28s]  tortuously through the forest nightfall as you need to rest. The path passes by a heavy thicket
[2032.28s -> 2042.79s]  of tangled branches. Let's investigate it. The dense bushes curl up around themselves in a tangle
[2042.79s -> 2047.90s]  but in the darkness you can make out nothing more. I think this is good it's night time we should
[2047.90s -> 2054.09s]  sleep. The thicket will make a good shelter. You clamor into a hollow between its roots and lie
[2054.09s -> 2059.05s]  down. Laying your pack down by the roots of a tree you try to rest despite the strange noises
[2059.05s -> 2067.40s]  that float across the landscape. At least you have eaten already today. Then we're good. The
[2067.40s -> 2079.18s]  stream runs tortuously through the Thanos rant. You got I I really do wonder because the amount
[2079.18s -> 2085.19s]  of people that would pay to make sure I ended up in cringe compilations. Do you know what I mean?
[2085.19s -> 2090.70s]  Like there are there's some of you here that that's worth a lot of money to you to make sure that
[2090.70s -> 2101.06s]  that happens. You know like I know that's what you'd be doing it for. You don't need to pay to see
[2101.06s -> 2117.30s]  that. Are you already in them? Nah you already are there. No what? Stop. Do we live rent free
[2118.26s -> 2129.24s]  in your head? Not really. I mean during streams yeah and maybe like maybe sometimes. I feel like
[2129.24s -> 2133.96s]  by the very nature of being a live streamer I'm constantly thinking about like the stream and
[2133.96s -> 2141.86s]  stuff. All right I'll think about it. I'll think about it. Maybe I don't know maybe I'll just put
[2141.86s -> 2146.50s]  it to charity or something. That'd be it's easy way to do that right? I don't it's like a better
[2146.50s -> 2155.00s]  way to do it probably. I don't know. We'll see. I'll think about it. Charity incentive war to have
[2155.00s -> 2167.08s]  me do it or not do it. The easiest way to do it is to never do it. Actually true and that is that is
[2167.08s -> 2180.76s]  a that chat comment is just like you get it. You get it. But I'm sorry I don't. I guess I'll never
[2180.76s -> 2205.11s]  learn. That's what makes me the cool streamer. I did that to specifically get into a cringe
[2205.11s -> 2211.16s]  compilation so let's go. All right your eyes close and you let your tiredness overtake you.
[2212.60s -> 2219.43s]  You wake suddenly. There's a flapping of dark wings from overhead. A giant bat is circling above
[2219.43s -> 2233.56s]  you. Your journey has been plagued by these creatures. What can I do? Let's see. You should
[2233.56s -> 2246.95s]  title that stream to cringe or not to cringe? That is the question. Oh man and I'm dressed up in a
[2246.95s -> 2263.37s]  Shakespeare outfit. Uh there's obviously danger. Pep is strength. I think I'm just fight. I don't
[2263.37s -> 2281.00s]  want to waste any stamina. Let's fight. This bat has a lot of attack power. This guy is the CCO of
[2281.00s -> 2295.22s]  off-brand. I just came up with an incredibly engaging live stream event right now. Are you
[2295.22s -> 2301.13s]  trying to tell me that that was not that's not what just happened? Just tell me that's wrong.
[2301.13s -> 2307.30s]  I'm going full blast. All right it's actually good that I did.
[2314.73s -> 2322.73s]  Have Ludwig do it. No it has to be me. Although I kind of like that too though.
[2327.82s -> 2341.72s]  Uh I'm going to defend. Yep. Uh I'm going all in. Sorry. I would I would read these but it's pretty
[2341.72s -> 2353.27s]  you can read them. It's just kind of like you swung and hit them. Okay what about all the Avengers
[2353.27s -> 2360.07s]  or different streamers and during the all the costumes are on the ground and we are over the
[2360.07s -> 2368.49s]  course of the next 45 minutes going to get into these costumes and like if there's enough money
[2368.49s -> 2375.50s]  that's telling us to no to not do it then we don't do it and if there's enough that that says yes
[2375.50s -> 2388.39s]  then we continue to put it on over then after 45 minutes we end it and see where it is. Could have
[2388.39s -> 2397.43s]  gone fallen. Would you say what would the point what would be the point of that just to see you
[2397.43s -> 2406.02s]  guys in costumes? No because once we get yeah what is the point of this? The point is to get
[2406.02s -> 2411.70s]  in the costumes and be and just and do like Avengers scenes and because people hate it
[2411.70s -> 2426.50s]  fairly. Fuck I thought he was going to go low. Avengers hot dove stream. It's going to be the
[2426.50s -> 2433.66s]  Hulk and they just get into the water and they're just green paint just starts coming off. All right
[2433.66s -> 2444.97s]  this little bat is fucking me up. I gotta pay attention. Stop defending when you're being good
[2444.97s -> 2450.73s]  at the game and it's annoying. I could have done it again. All right I gotta all right all right
[2451.29s -> 2466.12s]  that's a that's a fun idea. I'll add it to the to the notepad. Here we go. Only one? Okay creatures
[2466.12s -> 2473.77s]  eyes are fixed on you. There comes a big one. I'm getting I'm getting absolutely destroyed right now.
[2473.77s -> 2479.50s]  This is ridiculous. There's no way he's going more than 3.0 and he's not. All right I gotta go
[2479.50s -> 2485.53s]  all in. There's no way he's gonna go out. No he's not. Yes he is. Oh my god I'm just getting outplayed.
[2485.53s -> 2503.30s]  Oh my god fuck you. Why this bat? I I I fought like I fought a gigantic like Chimera and I beat it
[2503.30s -> 2521.13s]  easier than the single bat. What the fuck? What? Fucking die. Yes all right. How much did I lose?
[2522.09s -> 2536.25s]  12 health. Whatever. The creature falls from the sky dead. You lost some gold. Entered the
[2536.25s -> 2542.09s]  Vishalami Marsh and you collected the sun serpent meaning there are now only five serpents remaining.
[2542.09s -> 2552.18s]  And we have to make like an original song and put like different memes from all the Avengers
[2552.18s -> 2559.38s]  characters. Like you know sing about like a Thanos is gonna snap you and shit. It's something fucking
[2559.46s -> 2567.62s]  awful. You know what I'm saying? An original song that we all have to sing in unison.
[2572.73s -> 2576.17s]  It's it hurts. I'm just trying to figure out how to get the most money.
[2590.55s -> 2594.55s]  Only if you paint yourself purple. All right I'm I'm stuck on this and I need to get off of it.
[2594.55s -> 2604.87s]  Well I've what I said for charity. This is not most money for me. I said this would be a charity
[2604.87s -> 2612.34s]  stream. That's the best way to do it. This is guys this is not happening. I just puke out random
[2612.34s -> 2616.02s]  bullshit sometimes. This is not happening. We're not doing this. This is not a thing we're doing
[2616.02s -> 2623.43s]  tomorrow. Let's say that's how you reel them in right? Now they want they want it to happen.
[2623.43s -> 2629.96s]  Hey yeah you and me get it right? We know. Okay all right I let we're playing we're playing we're
[2629.96s -> 2635.93s]  playing again. The bush is a thick tangle peering between the branches. You can make out something
[2635.93s -> 2646.70s]  covered over. Oh I have the axe. You hew the branches away with the axe in swift easy strokes.
[2646.70s -> 2654.02s]  The foliage falls away to reveal first a glassless window and then the top corner of a door. It seems
[2654.02s -> 2676.55s]  the branches are growing in front of and out of an ancient hut. Go in the window? Did you? Yeah I
[2676.55s -> 2680.62s]  took 10 damage from the bat. I'm gonna cut free. Cut free the door. You keep cutting until you have
[2680.62s -> 2686.89s]  uncovered the door enough that you might be able to pull it open. Let me look in here first. Before
[2686.89s -> 2691.66s]  going inside you think to peer in through the window. You can make a little out through the
[2691.66s -> 2697.64s]  thick foliage that continues inside. When it seems the hut is otherwise empty then for a moment
[2697.64s -> 2711.93s]  something seems to move. But looking again you see nothing. Could be a genetic health. I'm gonna go
[2711.93s -> 2719.45s]  in. I would say I had a lot of health but I have a lot of food. You heave on the door hauling it open
[2719.45s -> 2724.57s]  ancient dust spills out into the forest air and a million crawling things scuttle from holes all
[2724.57s -> 2734.06s]  over the ancient wood. Smell the air. The air from inside the hut is an old and stale air but it does
[2734.06s -> 2742.39s]  not stink of death decay or animal. You look about for where to go. Are we going in or am I running
[2742.39s -> 2761.05s]  by? Go in? Going. When are you going to drink the grimace milkshake? I don't know. When I go to
[2761.05s -> 2768.98s]  McDonald's I'll make sure to get one. Okay. You push your way inside the ancient overgrown hut.
[2768.98s -> 2773.54s]  There are patches of yellow moss. Much like the one you tried earlier. Growing on the back of a
[2773.54s -> 2782.60s]  wall. Oh really? This is edible. You gather up a handful of moss. It is much like the last bunch
[2782.60s -> 2789.59s]  you ate. Eat it. There we go. You chew through the moss. Feeling much better for it. All right I'm
[2789.59s -> 2801.43s]  gonna I'm gonna do suss. What do we got? Definitely there's suss. There's also sap. Cause depression.
[2802.66s -> 2807.30s]  Also by the way for those of you that have never played this game. If you sap and there's nobody
[2807.30s -> 2812.58s]  to sap. It happens to you. You literally cast it on yourself because it attaches to the first
[2812.58s -> 2822.87s]  living thing in the room. So I don't think I want to do that right now. You can do sun. I have a sun
[2822.87s -> 2836.60s]  jewel and it's free. Just brighten it up. See the future. I can use the crystal ball here. The
[2836.60s -> 2850.57s]  crystal ball is useful. Sense danger. I'll do I'll do the meme. Cast suss. Craft the enchantment and
[2850.57s -> 2858.55s]  a steady voice begins to speak to you. It informs you quite calmly. The hut is not empty. Goodbye.
[2860.86s -> 2870.39s]  Okay. Something here. Let's look around. In the thin sunlight through the windows of the hut,
[2870.39s -> 2877.66s]  you can make out writing on the far wall. This is the house Elisey built and in its doorway
[2877.66s -> 2886.66s]  blood was spilled but that blood has dried and gone and poor Elisey is still alone.
[2890.66s -> 2898.46s]  Hmm. Look at the doorway. Looking at the doorway you see the dark shadow of a bloodstain
[2898.46s -> 2905.21s]  wiped carefully around the sill like a ward against an evil spirit. Not that such magic
[2905.21s -> 2911.54s]  works of course. The only true magic comes from the stars. At least that's what they told you.
[2911.54s -> 2921.69s]  There are a few more things scratched into the wood. What does it say? You look at the other
[2921.69s -> 2928.33s]  scratched marks. They're they are hard to comprehend precisely. One appears to depict a person in a
[2928.33s -> 2935.53s]  circular bubble floating harmlessly above a raging tornado or a whirlpool. Another shows a fiery
[2935.53s -> 2941.37s]  ball. Perhaps the sun. Perhaps not. Being drenched by a fist squeezing what looks like a handful of
[2941.37s -> 2959.14s]  berries. Interesting. So we got floating which is the float spell. Raging tornado is I think
[2959.14s -> 2969.75s]  with the horn right? It causes like a windstorm. Fiery ball that's hot potentially and drenched
[2969.75s -> 2976.95s]  by a handful of berries. Let me see. Looking into the dim corners of the hut you uncover an
[2976.95s -> 2983.43s]  old vial of water. As you lift it to the light it gives off a very faint shine. In your mind
[2984.49s -> 3014.28s]  you feel the ape's gentle voice. Watery this vial is blessed to the god Gred. Gred. Do I take this?
[3014.28s -> 3026.30s]  I'm I think if I take this and I drink it the ape is gone and we might get a new god. We might get
[3026.30s -> 3037.08s]  the god Gred. I'll keep it. I'll keep it. You place the vial of holy water into your pack.
[3037.08s -> 3046.42s]  A lucky find. Oh all right so let me just what do we got here? There's some obviously some puzzle
[3046.42s -> 3051.78s]  here or some secret to do. One of them was floating. This is see the future. I can't do
[3051.78s -> 3061.34s]  floating. I could just cause depression. What is it? What is this? Doc is heal disease. I need a
[3061.34s -> 3078.18s]  medicinal potion. I could do sap but who would I even do it to? I think I'm missing information.
[3078.18s -> 3090.42s]  I'm gonna look into the future. You settle into a sitting position by the roots of a tree and take
[3090.42s -> 3094.52s]  out the orb of a crystal. Reaching up to the constellations overhead you create the spell.
[3094.52s -> 3100.49s]  You're somewhere new. The world seems to disappear replaced by a vision. A ring of tall shadowy
[3100.49s -> 3105.91s]  stones in a desolate waste. You stand by their center holding above your head a long yellow
[3105.91s -> 3111.72s]  feather taken from some colossal bird. You are casting a spell of curious power. I did this
[3111.72s -> 3123.88s]  before. Should I drop it? Dude you should use phar to see if you do the cringe avengers stream.
[3123.88s -> 3139.35s]  I'm gonna drop it. As the spell builds you panic and release the feather. Slowly it flutters to the
[3139.35s -> 3144.79s]  ground but as it does so the spell of this strange place takes hold. The feather erupts into vivid
[3144.79s -> 3151.53s]  flame and you shield your eyes. It fades. The day is likely to be clear and will be hot once more.
[3151.53s -> 3158.57s]  Did I just do that to get the weather forecast? The day is likely to be clear will there be hot
[3158.57s -> 3171.00s]  later in the afternoon. Showers coming in tomorrow evening. Okay I don't think I can do anything here.
[3171.24s -> 3182.92s]  You know what I'm just gonna cause depression. Why not? Sap. You gather the constellations into
[3182.92s -> 3187.75s]  order around you and immediately feel yourself losing your energy and drive. With no other
[3187.75s -> 3195.82s]  creature nearby the magic is turned on you. Oh great. What the hell is it? I'm missing an item.
[3196.38s -> 3208.02s]  I can't do it I don't think. It's probably dock. Yeah it has to. It's either dock or damn it.
[3208.02s -> 3219.56s]  I can't. I can't do it. I gotta go. Go back outside. Can't do it. Damn it. I couldn't solve
[3219.56s -> 3229.72s]  the riddle of the hut. There is nothing more to be done here. You leave the hut behind. Okay well
[3229.72s -> 3234.82s]  I wanted to go over here. Oh I can't go over there. That's like a hundred that's like 300
[3234.82s -> 3251.45s]  feet in the air. I need this to be fixed. Let me see what happens if I go down here. You walk on
[3251.45s -> 3256.47s]  between the trees as the sun climbs towards its zenith. The winds pick up. A large ancient tree
[3256.47s -> 3264.82s]  has fallen down across the path. I'm the trunk for review. You clamor up onto the trunk and look off
[3264.82s -> 3269.78s]  into the distance of the trees. To the east the mountains rise tall and cold and to the south
[3269.78s -> 3279.83s]  you see the forest pool. A soft plop echoes from the tree trunk. You leave your pack on the tree
[3279.83s -> 3286.20s]  trunk and move carefully along its length. Eyes peeled for what it was making that sound. Suddenly
[3286.20s -> 3297.58s]  of its own accord your pack topples from the trunk and onto the ground. Somebody invisible? Pick it
[3297.58s -> 3302.49s]  up. You return to your pack and reach down to pick it up and something bashes you backwards.
[3303.05s -> 3310.33s]  Fresh blood springs into your arm. You have been scratched by deep claws but you can still see
[3310.33s -> 3328.49s]  nothing. God damn it it's a snatacat. Let's talk with animals. All right we're doing yap.
[3328.49s -> 3332.49s]  Grabbing the wig from your pack you put it on and weave your spell. The faint growls in the
[3332.49s -> 3338.84s]  trees slowly begin to slur, turning into distinct words. The creature appears to be talking to
[3338.84s -> 3350.66s]  itself. Side open. Stay down. Stay low. I can hear you, you call back, speaking in the creature's
[3350.66s -> 3357.94s]  language of growls and whines. Stay where you are. It tries to fool me but it can't.
[3359.46s -> 3367.11s]  Being invisible has clearly driven this creature quite insane. Leave or I will skin you. What are
[3367.11s -> 3378.07s]  you? It wants to know what I am. It wants to know what eats it. It wants to know what eats it. It
[3378.07s -> 3386.15s]  wants to know who. Leave or I will skin you. This is your only warning. The creature seems to consider
[3386.15s -> 3392.41s]  for quite a moment. Then it launches itself forward. Suddenly long gashes appear on your
[3392.41s -> 3397.05s]  arm as claws that you cannot see seem to rake your flesh. For a moment you feel hot breath
[3397.05s -> 3409.24s]  on your cheek. Then it's gone. You could have casted sun in the hut. I thought all I had was
[3409.24s -> 3431.50s]  um I could. It wasn't just sap and sus. Really? Really? Really? Really? Like really? Really?
[3431.50s -> 3448.63s]  Really? Really? I'm going back. That's one out of three. That's all right. Okay look at the doorway.
[3448.63s -> 3459.14s]  Look at the scratches. Search the corners. Yep they take the vial. Okay cast a spell.
[3462.90s -> 3475.94s]  Oh you weren't full of shit. All right let's cast sun. You craft the enchantment until the sun jewel
[3475.94s -> 3485.61s]  starts to glow with a magical white glow. Nothing. Nothing. Didn't do anything. It just looks cool.
[3485.61s -> 3499.53s]  Remember why do your tags say thinking about beans? I don't think they do. Huh maybe combine
[3499.53s -> 3517.30s]  with a different one. You have to sleep in here. Really? It does. Thinking about beans. I don't know.
[3517.30s -> 3527.82s]  I didn't do it. All right see what happens. God damn it. I think I have to come back here.
[3527.82s -> 3543.58s]  All right well now. All right it didn't work. Your tags are fucked up. It doesn't matter.
[3543.58s -> 3551.10s]  Okay soft plop move. I'm not fighting anything. You rise quickly and gather your things listening
[3551.10s -> 3556.54s]  carefully for any suspicious sounds and you catch one a soft deep growl a few feet away.
[3556.54s -> 3566.73s]  So just run. I'm just gonna run. You waste no more time and scurry away between the trees. Okay
[3567.29s -> 3585.37s]  here we are again. I need to move this to the right. I wonder is there a way down here. I could
[3585.37s -> 3593.61s]  go down here and see if I can get across somehow. We haven't gone down here at all. I haven't seen
[3593.61s -> 3603.35s]  any of this. I'm gonna turn this over here and see if I can do anything or maybe I'll turn it down
[3603.35s -> 3616.95s]  this way. I can swim. It's it's fine. I lost a fucking food. Your fragile possessions are ruined.
[3616.95s -> 3638.89s]  All your soft food has been ruined. What the fuck. It's all right. One food loss is fine. Yeah it's
[3638.89s -> 3650.71s]  fine. Okay I still can do this but I'm afraid to touch it. So what can I get up there if I go like
[3650.71s -> 3665.64s]  this? Is that intact? I don't think it is. Is the bridge intact if I do that? It's hard to tell. I
[3665.64s -> 3678.65s]  don't think so. What about this way? Looks like it. I wonder if I can get. I'm talking about over
[3678.65s -> 3687.93s]  here though. It might be hard to actually do it. I have to activate another beacon I think. Yeah it
[3687.93s -> 3698.58s]  gets kind of messed up on the left side. It's all right. I'll aim it this way. I don't want to aim
[3698.58s -> 3710.38s]  it all. This is a town over there. I'll aim it over here. That way or something. Oh so this is
[3710.38s -> 3718.33s]  the town in the past. This is the town now. It looks pretty much in ruins right now. What do you
[3718.33s -> 3731.18s]  think? Should I go to Tin Pang? Tin Pang in the in the past first? Yeah let's check out the past
[3731.18s -> 3749.05s]  first. So that'll be fine. Now I could just go down. This is another beacon so I'll go like this
[3749.05s -> 3756.30s]  and we'll explore Klattaback. Klattabang? Klattaback? All right I'm going down. I'm going to eat.
[3756.30s -> 3774.97s]  Somebody said eat food before you lose it. That's a good idea. Let's eat a cooked meat. Make a move.
[3774.97s -> 3783.58s]  Get the ring please I beg you. I don't know how to get it because if I break the branch it falls
[3783.58s -> 3788.04s]  down. If it falls down it falls into the water and if it falls into the water I can't get it.
[3788.04s -> 3792.95s]  If it falls down in the water I can make the beam go over there but I did that and I can't get it.
[3792.95s -> 3806.34s]  I don't know. It's tricky. Maybe the other tower? Point it at the other tower. Just take it off the
[3806.34s -> 3813.96s]  branch when it's smaller. The ring doesn't necessarily fall in the water. If you go into
[3813.96s -> 3832.10s]  the past the tree won't be grown by then. Hey. You know. Hold on. Can I concentrate this beam
[3832.10s -> 3842.74s]  that way? Because if I can concentrate that this way then this can go in the past. Come back here
[3842.74s -> 3851.21s]  when the ring is. Yeah. Maybe it'll reach. One of these will do it so I'll leave it. All right so
[3851.21s -> 3874.65s]  we're gonna head down here. I got this pointing over at that of the town. Let's make a move. Wait
[3874.65s -> 3881.83s]  I have to swim across again? I can't just like bury my face through the trees? God damn it. Okay
[3881.83s -> 3898.12s]  well whatever. I'm good. Your videos on this game got me through a day where I was throwing up every
[3898.12s -> 3905.08s]  half hour. Well that sounds awful. Okay. Things flutter in the trees all around. Hope you feel
[3905.08s -> 3911.91s]  better. Wait that was like eight years ago. Hope you felt better eight years ago. Things flutter
[3911.91s -> 3916.07s]  in the trees all around. The sun is all but gone. Soon it will be dark. A movement in the bushes
[3916.07s -> 3923.32s]  catches your eyes. A glimpse of red and a snake's body. This is the red snake that we've seen a few
[3923.32s -> 3934.10s]  times. I might be getting I might be being watched. Let's go. Let's investigate it. Why not? The snake
[3934.10s -> 3941.94s]  disappears before you can catch it. God damn. Do I want to go up and around or should I just go
[3941.94s -> 3950.55s]  straight down? I'll just go straight down. Easier that way. The path winds torturously through the
[3950.55s -> 3955.88s]  forest. Darkness closes in. You should try to find a suitable spot to sleep. Underfoot the earth has
[3955.88s -> 3963.18s]  been churned to mud and you notice the branches either side of this route are broken. Let's look
[3963.18s -> 3970.20s]  at the mud. You pause to check the mud. Sure enough you quickly find a sign. A paw print at least
[3970.20s -> 3974.74s]  twice the size of your palm. Yeah there's a snat of cats everywhere. We need to go through this
[3974.74s -> 3979.93s]  quickly. We gotta we gotta go. You keep moving hoping that whatever lives around here doesn't
[3979.93s -> 3987.88s]  find you. Snat of cats are everywhere here. They're very dangerous. We don't have time to
[3987.88s -> 3992.94s]  investigate every branch that falls. You walk on between the trees in the darkness you can see
[3992.94s -> 4002.66s]  nothing through the curling branches. Almost out of it. Are they invisible? They are invisible.
[4002.66s -> 4006.82s]  You trace what might be a path and might be an old river through the trees of the forest.
[4006.82s -> 4012.17s]  The moon sets. More stars appear. You've reached the edge of the forest. Through the trees you
[4012.17s -> 4018.87s]  can see the level steps extending into the night. Now might be a good time to rest before
[4018.87s -> 4026.23s]  you go much further. I really don't want to do it here but I need to sleep. Removing your pack by
[4026.23s -> 4032.76s]  the roots of a tree you try to settle despite the cold. At least you have eaten well already.
[4032.76s -> 4037.46s]  You lie back and try to forget your troubles. You wake halfway through the night at the sound
[4037.46s -> 4047.61s]  of breathing from between the trees. Snat of cat. What if I stay still? You stay quite still.
[4047.61s -> 4058.65s]  Something is sniffing the air. It is a wolf. Padding closer. It's a wolf. Maybe I could talk
[4058.65s -> 4079.99s]  to the wolf. Tell. Read minds. Wrap. Talk all languages. Raz. Sharpen blade. There's always zap.
[4079.99s -> 4087.86s]  Always. That's my entire first playthrough of the game. Pep is strength. There's also pop which is
[4087.86s -> 4098.33s]  grenade but I don't have a pebble. Let's see if we can talk. Talk all languages. Grabbing the
[4098.33s -> 4102.49s]  wig from your pack you put it on and weave your spell but this spell is intended for translating
[4102.49s -> 4119.56s]  non-human speech and not the utterances of beasts and animals. Come here talk to me. Oh okay. Yeah
[4119.56s -> 4128.57s]  rap is talk all languages. Yap is talk to animals. Okay well why can I not do yap? I just don't feel
[4128.57s -> 4148.17s]  like it. Just zap this fucker. Zap. You gather the constellations into order around you building up
[4148.17s -> 4155.82s]  a charge of electrical energy around your palm. Fire the bolt into the sky. This would be scary
[4155.82s -> 4167.18s]  right? Into the sky? All right I'm going into the sky. You fire the lightning bolt up into the air
[4167.18s -> 4173.91s]  and the flash cracks the heavens. The wolf squeals in fear and turning on the spot it bolts away into
[4173.91s -> 4188.71s]  the night. The silence of the trees returns but I have alerted every single person in this five
[4188.71s -> 4205.10s]  mile radius of my existence. You wake with your head on a tree root and the smell of fresh dew
[4205.10s -> 4213.29s]  in your nostrils. Time to choose a direction. There maybe is something to be said about going
[4213.29s -> 4220.58s]  up this way and investigating whatever this is but hey that's for you to do in your playthrough.
[4220.58s -> 4237.67s]  I'm getting out of the sonata forest. It's too dangerous. Jeremy can you ask my mom to get me
[4237.67s -> 4244.22s]  the grimace shake? I don't I don't know I'm not your parent. I'm not it's not like oh hey let me
[4244.22s -> 4257.13s]  go ask the streamer to can hey ma streamer said I can. You head out across the steps the air stirs
[4257.13s -> 4263.56s]  a little still cold but fresh. In front of you stretches another plane more rock than dust this
[4263.56s -> 4269.35s]  time and built of layers and layers of stone stacked like scattered papers. These are the
[4269.35s -> 4276.14s]  clatterback steps said to be the home of strange half human half asymian creatures. As you walk you
[4276.14s -> 4281.50s]  see a strange sight a village of listing huts in the middle of open space with no walls or defenses
[4281.50s -> 4291.91s]  at all. Ugly villagers lope from tent to tent dressed in animal skins. The men and women are
[4291.91s -> 4296.95s]  strong and lanky dressed in animal skins by the gate two creatures stand with hefty wooden clubs
[4296.95s -> 4309.56s]  clatter men. What can I do? Mods please link him the grimace shake on TikTok. You don't need to give
[4309.56s -> 4325.85s]  me the I know what the grimace shake is. I can go invisible. Invisible? There's also big I could grow
[4325.85s -> 4340.66s]  in size to be huge. I could say what's safe passage here. I could cause stench but I don't
[4340.66s -> 4355.38s]  have a nose plug. I could also summon a giant. I could just walk in there with a giant and be like
[4355.38s -> 4362.17s]  hey me and my giant friend. How many of these I think I only have two or three of these left right?
[4366.02s -> 4374.34s]  Invisible might be interesting. I'll let you guys decide. Here's the choices you have you have
[4374.34s -> 4382.23s]  literally 60 seconds. Invisibility, summon a giant, or become a giant. Which one? Those are your
[4382.23s -> 4395.42s]  choices. You get 60 seconds. Summon giant, become giant, or what was the last one? Oh wait what was
[4395.42s -> 4402.44s]  it? Oh I forget it. Why do I forget it? Invisible right okay. Invisible, summon giant, become giant.
[4402.44s -> 4431.22s]  Those are three very interesting routes to take. Don't be a coward. Don't be a coward. Can you play
[4431.22s -> 4442.79s]  the grimace game boy color game on stream? Maybe one day. All right what's it what's it look like?
[4442.79s -> 4455.94s]  It's still close. Become giant and invisibility. It's kind of trending in one direction but I think
[4455.94s -> 4474.04s]  we have our answer. Become giant is the winner. All right big. Grow in size. You cast a spell
[4474.04s -> 4479.00s]  inflating to more than twice your usual height. It's actually it's not a giant it's just like
[4479.00s -> 4486.58s]  you're kind of bigger. A path a path leads into the village or you could skirt past it. Why did
[4486.58s -> 4494.09s]  I do this? I just got taller? You approach the guards. The guards are clearly impressed by your
[4494.09s -> 4501.03s]  size. They stand quickly aside and let you enter the village without question. You flick one over
[4501.03s -> 4512.20s]  as you pass. What? Oh this guy's impressive. Okay you step into the center of the village. Gradually
[4512.20s -> 4521.10s]  you shrink back down to your normal size. Is that bad? So I walk in the front door and they're like
[4521.10s -> 4533.74s]  yeah bro step right this way. Is that bad? Okay large hut. One hut is much larger than the others.
[4533.74s -> 4539.74s]  Above its door is a sign depicting a picture of an owl and a hammer. It is amazing anyone here can
[4539.74s -> 4549.13s]  draw let alone perform crafts. From inside you can hear the sound of hammering. Look through the
[4549.13s -> 4555.59s]  window. Peering in through the window you see a clatter man working away at a bench. He moves with
[4555.59s -> 4561.75s]  unusual delicacy for these creatures. His long thin fingers carefully adjusting the position
[4561.75s -> 4571.02s]  of whatever it is he's working on. You can't help noticing he has an unusually large skull. Okay
[4571.02s -> 4579.50s]  well let's go in. The clatter man looks up as you enter. He puts down the tiny hammer and pincers he
[4579.50s -> 4586.41s]  has been using to repair a piece of fine jewelry and tilts his head to regard you and greet him.
[4587.13s -> 4595.77s]  You greet him with a nod. He seems to understand this and nods in reply. He's in his workbench.
[4595.77s -> 4600.57s]  You step forward and look over his workbench and he gestures with an open palm to let you look.
[4600.57s -> 4605.86s]  The clatter man has a variety of fine tools, pincers, all spikes for scratching and etching,
[4605.86s -> 4612.23s]  even a vice. He's clearly a master craftsman despite his species. When you are finished he
[4612.23s -> 4631.38s]  steps forward to you gesturing for your pack. Pack? Show him my pack. You hold out your pack
[4631.38s -> 4635.22s]  to him. He begins to rummage through investigating everything with his long supple hands and
[4635.22s -> 4640.50s]  occasionally pausing to scratch his bulging skull as though his brain is itching at the sight of
[4640.50s -> 4645.67s]  your gear. Then he digs around under his bench before finally pulling a long metal shaft and
[4645.67s -> 4651.67s]  a hooked metal grip. He pushes the two together screwing and clamping with a strange hooked tool.
[4651.67s -> 4656.31s]  After a short while he produces what appears to be a well-weighted long sword and hands it to you.
[4660.92s -> 4669.51s]  All right I got him. I'll pay him. You pull out your purse to pay the clatter man. He seems more
[4669.51s -> 4680.74s]  interested in the operation of the drawstring at the top of the pouch than the money. Really?
[4680.74s -> 4692.26s]  Take the sword? You accept the sword with some suspicion. Uh I just get a free sword? Let's see
[4692.26s -> 4697.58s]  ask him what he's doing. You try to ask him what he's doing but he ignores the sounds coming from
[4697.58s -> 4701.50s]  your mouth as if they were just the banging and ringing of his tools. Seems like he is carving
[4701.50s -> 4707.35s]  jewelry from colored stones. They do not seem to be precious or even beautiful but the weird
[4707.35s -> 4714.82s]  twisted shapes he is carving are complex and intricate and remarkably precise. Can I take one?
[4714.82s -> 4724.07s]  Take a piece. You reach out to take one of the pieces a bejeweled item of clear value but he
[4724.07s -> 4728.95s]  responds much more quickly than you expect snatching up a strange two-handed contraption.
[4728.95s -> 4733.03s]  He opens the handle and the device expands a series of criss-cross bars. At the far end is
[4733.03s -> 4741.62s]  a blade which skewers you through the shoulder pinning you to the wall. Holy shit. Uh oh. He
[4741.62s -> 4746.58s]  tilts his head the other way and to make his point wiggles the contraption making your shoulder
[4746.58s -> 4752.81s]  bleed. Uh oh. You try to spread your arms to collect the starlight for a spell but the clatter
[4752.81s -> 4760.66s]  man simply twists the contraption. You howl in pain and cease your attempt at enchantment.
[4760.66s -> 4768.39s]  Release me! You demand. The craftsman listens with interest but does not retract the extended arm.
[4768.39s -> 4774.57s]  I'm sorry. I didn't mean I didn't mean to go for the jewels. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please
[4774.57s -> 4782.58s]  take me with you. Take me with you. Uh I can't cast a spell. He's got me like pinned by the
[4782.58s -> 4787.75s]  fucking shoulder blades with this like weird device that's sticking through my shoulder.
[4787.75s -> 4794.25s]  I beg of you please please please release me please appealing to all the gods and the spirits
[4794.25s -> 4800.34s]  you can name. The craftsman appears to respond when the name of Herm the cloud god is mentioned
[4800.34s -> 4804.76s]  and slackens his grip on the contraption enough that you are able to push it free
[4804.76s -> 4811.37s]  and stagger clear. Not taking your eyes off the dangerous creature you move backwards towards the
[4811.37s -> 4822.95s]  doorway then hurry out of the low hut. Jesus. I feel like I don't I feel like I probably should
[4822.95s -> 4830.84s]  leave now. By the fire you head over to the fire pit but it is unlit during the day and there is
[4830.84s -> 4836.70s]  no one here. Stop and eat. Taking one of your smoked fish from your pack you fill your empty
[4836.70s -> 4843.88s]  stomach. You look around the village once more. I guess I could I could be here I could come here
[4843.88s -> 4853.91s]  at night. I did get a sword yeah well let me see the sword. A plus two long sword oh
[4857.05s -> 4871.21s]  all right I think that gives me plus two to all of my swings that's huge. He gave you a sword and
[4871.21s -> 4883.22s]  you tried to steal from him. Well I was gonna pay. Hey I tried to pay. Remember I was like here take
[4883.22s -> 4889.46s]  all these I want to pay you I have coins. I guess that doesn't mean hey dude just like put your hand
[4889.46s -> 4895.91s]  into the fucking like pasta sauce. That's not how it works. Oh no no I have money I have money I'm
[4895.91s -> 4899.59s]  gonna put my hand in the pasta sauce and just take pasta out of it. Yeah that's like give you a
[4899.59s -> 4907.61s]  fucking hand out of here. Don't touch my what are you doing? All right I'm gonna get out of here
[4907.61s -> 4914.81s]  before I cause it any more trouble slip away. The village has no walls you slip between two huts
[4914.81s -> 4927.02s]  and back out into the plains. Let's check out over here. You march onwards ascending and descending
[4927.02s -> 4932.46s]  as the ground breaks and changes level. As the morning moves on the wind begins to rise. A small
[4932.54s -> 4940.70s]  patch of flowers grows here just by a small rock. Ooh flowers. You smell the flowers they emit a rich
[4940.70s -> 4945.96s]  thick smell that makes you feel somewhat giddy. Still you feel somewhat better for it.
[4947.14s -> 4960.15s]  Smell the flowers again. Uh smell the flowers again. You take another long sniff of the flowers.
[4960.71s -> 4964.71s]  The scent is so strong that it makes your gaze turn briefly red and blotchy.
[4965.67s -> 4978.66s]  Oh all this guy does is do weird organic drugs. Smell them again. You lie down on the ground and
[4978.66s -> 4983.70s]  bury your nose deep into the flower patch and sniff. The effect of the smell is not as powerful
[4983.70s -> 4990.57s]  now as though the effect is wearing off. All right all right let's get out of here. You continue to
[4990.57s -> 5006.98s]  walk. More? No I don't want to do more. That's dangerous. Sunflower update. I am pleased to
[5006.98s -> 5017.62s]  announce our biggest sunflower has officially opened and we did we have one two three four
[5017.62s -> 5025.74s]  there are five sunflowers this year and we did one of those loot boxes where we don't we didn't
[5025.74s -> 5030.84s]  know what the colors were going to be because it was a kind of a mix of the sunflowers could
[5030.84s -> 5037.13s]  be like red or orange or brown or purple or there's a ton of different combinations. I'm pleased to
[5037.13s -> 5053.37s]  report color of the main sunflower the big one is a pale yellow with a big brown ring in the middle
[5053.37s -> 5059.86s]  it's a beautiful pattern it's pale yellow with a brown ring around the center of kind of where the
[5059.86s -> 5070.18s]  petals are going out it's a brown almost painted ring around the middle it is gorgeous picture
[5071.43s -> 5078.18s]  hold on the pictures are coming but the thing with the sunflower I want to make sure it's fully
[5078.18s -> 5085.35s]  opened and has time to breathe so you get a really good picture just opened as of today
[5085.35s -> 5098.97s]  still don't know what the colors of the other ones are though do it after the ad break
[5098.97s -> 5114.44s]  all right let's keep going rule of third andy you'll see one is grimace purple might be can
[5114.44s -> 5122.87s]  you play as an ad please um okay I will play I'll play an ad if you can get more than 95 percent
[5122.87s -> 5128.82s]  that says yes on a pole you can just start it now that's been not it has to be over 95 percent
[5128.82s -> 5136.25s]  that's been 96 percent or higher all right you walk on climbing slightly across the dusty steps
[5136.25s -> 5142.60s]  the sun continues to climb the steep sky in the middle of the steps you come across a strange
[5142.60s -> 5150.20s]  site a wooden pole as high as a tree with nothing around it it has no knots handles or holds of any
[5150.20s -> 5156.04s]  kind nothing except a level platform right at the top clumps of the yellow moss you saw before grow
[5156.04s -> 5168.28s]  around the base of the pole I'll have way more of this let's get to full health look around you
[5168.28s -> 5173.88s]  stop and look around but can't make much out across the contours of the plane you might be able to see
[5173.88s -> 5180.97s]  more from the top of the pole of course from somewhere nearby you hear singing bang on the
[5180.97s -> 5193.18s]  pole watch an ad is no you guys not even close I said it has to be at least 96 percent you're at
[5193.18s -> 5202.87s]  71 percent right now that's just not happening now I'm sorry I got I like apologize I'm sorry
[5202.87s -> 5213.08s]  yeah 71 percent is it's yeah I can't show you an ad yeah it sucks like I'm fucking sorry
[5213.08s -> 5220.76s]  maybe we'll try again later it's like really disappointing but it's all right all right
[5220.76s -> 5238.84s]  listen bang on the pole or cast a spell what can we do uh h oh wait I do have a gale horn
[5239.40s -> 5248.09s]  when did I get a gale horn like episode two how long have I had that for is that why I snorted the
[5248.09s -> 5258.01s]  other one I've had a gale horn this whole time you do big again big is pretty cheap it's only
[5258.01s -> 5269.06s]  one stamina so something's obviously buried here can't do doc you do sus just make sure that
[5269.06s -> 5277.72s]  yeah it's just us you look to the stars and craft the magic into a steady voice it begins to speak
[5277.72s -> 5286.76s]  to you the voice informs you that this is a pole or a priest of froth who is fasting and contemplating
[5286.76s -> 5301.48s]  the procession of the sun he's likely to be quite mad okay listen you concentrate and listen
[5301.48s -> 5307.67s]  there's definitely a voice singing somewhere close at hand but there's no one anywhere in sight the
[5307.67s -> 5313.56s]  pole is set into a slight rise into the ground and you can see in all directions an invisible
[5313.56s -> 5323.27s]  creature perhaps dust funnels across the empty plane bang on the pole on the spell's information
[5323.27s -> 5330.04s]  you unbelt your blade and wallop the pole with the weapon in its sheath the wood vibrates
[5331.32s -> 5335.16s]  a moment later a shaggy face appears over the edge of the platform overhead
[5335.16s -> 5346.09s]  who's that who's that yeah yeah he's doing the singing are you fasting you demand no I'm not
[5346.09s -> 5353.34s]  doing the fasting I'm only not doing the eating what I am doing is he's doing the singing he is
[5353.42s -> 5365.80s]  bawling every word his throat must be sore now hmm what can you see the future and past is one
[5367.02s -> 5372.38s]  joining is separating and ghosts walking back and forth none of us are quite when we believe
[5372.38s -> 5381.66s]  ourselves to be I have experienced this myself shut your face hole I don't sit up on this pole
[5381.66s -> 5386.78s]  to learn what you muddlers can learn crawling around the ground with your full fat bellies
[5387.80s -> 5398.42s]  ah would you like some food I can give you some food he calls you something terrible in response
[5401.96s -> 5408.02s]  I was being generous do you suppose it's generous to torment people not doing the eating with food
[5408.90s -> 5418.01s]  oh why do you think I'm up on this pole oh he's fasting holy shit that's actually awful
[5420.65s -> 5425.69s]  hey you're fasting up there aren't you don't you want some food I have food that's just I'm
[5425.69s -> 5432.17s]  just taunting this is taunting this is not okay this is actually bad all right I would like to
[5432.17s -> 5443.38s]  learn from you the man does not reply but leans away however a moment later a hand appears over
[5443.38s -> 5453.21s]  the side of the platform and something falls to earth is a medallion is that for me you're a
[5453.21s -> 5459.74s]  sorcerer aren't you come up I hope you're a sorcerer otherwise I can't get down again
[5462.22s -> 5469.98s]  oh okay I gotta take it you take a hold of the medallion nothing in particular happens
[5469.98s -> 5481.86s]  come on then let's go you turn the medallion over in your hands it is a jewel studded and set loose
[5481.86s -> 5488.28s]  on a chain it is probably worth something to the north mist rolls across the edge of the forest
[5488.28s -> 5498.81s]  all right this is definitely a hover medallion or teleporting medallion zen hover in the air
[5498.81s -> 5513.30s]  require yeah okay so I can float up there yeah what else can I even do here I can take I can
[5513.30s -> 5523.03s]  just like blow the fucking gale horn and cause a tornado on this dude that would be so fucked up
[5526.15s -> 5534.97s]  well I'm gonna do zen the zen is how I mean this is they're teaching me to do zen you spin the
[5534.97s -> 5539.21s]  star light into a pattern around you and the medallion begins to glow as you rise gently up
[5539.21s -> 5547.40s]  into the air you are now floating off the ground float to the top of the pillar here we are up
[5547.40s -> 5555.32s]  here with this guy the man shuffles aside to allow you to bob down while taking back the
[5555.32s -> 5563.75s]  jeweled medallion now he took it back so you are a sorcerer I thought so I might have been a thief
[5565.34s -> 5571.46s]  you might have never gotten your medallion back that's true oh my sight assures me I will not
[5571.46s -> 5585.94s]  need it still I'd rather have it welcome to my little eerie what are you doing up here you demand
[5586.02s -> 5591.86s]  hi from the world I can see diagonally downwards onto the world I can see through the layers of
[5591.86s -> 5600.07s]  curse that affect this land the whole place has unraveled like a poorly woven shoe yeah from up
[5600.07s -> 5609.91s]  here I can see all right I'm at it float down I don't even have the medallion anymore I would
[5609.91s -> 5620.60s]  just be jumping off and dying I don't have the medallion why would this is bait that would be so
[5620.60s -> 5631.16s]  fucked up to see no I want to talk to him do you know of the seven serpents you demand
[5634.17s -> 5640.66s]  I see much from up here I know of the winged beast in their quest to devour you grind your
[5640.66s -> 5648.20s]  bones to dust and then spit that dust into the cup of the king of aniline east of bottles to
[5648.20s -> 5661.82s]  scratch underneath his loin cloth so do you like it up here the view is superb yeah I do not see
[5661.82s -> 5668.74s]  how a view can be superb it is only looking after all after he speaks you feel a weight
[5668.74s -> 5674.60s]  gather about your shoulders as you settle down onto the platform the way I was floating that
[5674.60s -> 5687.43s]  whole time the spell has worn off can you get me down from here where can I find the serpents
[5687.43s -> 5694.33s]  they are looking to find you anilander each is waiting for you some are hiding some are not
[5694.33s -> 5699.37s]  one waits for you in the very depths of lake eclala he means to pick you off when you're at
[5699.37s -> 5708.98s]  your weakest how can I find him you must encounter him I fear the only way would be to swim
[5709.72s -> 5718.55s]  until he senses your tiredness but that is a most foolish course can you tell me the serpent's
[5718.55s -> 5728.20s]  weaknesses these are most secret but some I think can be guessed at the time serpent cannot be
[5728.20s -> 5735.24s]  defeated from the forest of the north the trees seem to part and a gigantic bird lifts into view
[5735.24s -> 5745.80s]  its talons gleam in the sunlight he could get out of here bird yeah go away grab the platform
[5745.80s -> 5756.62s]  what do I do I think I'm gonna hold on okay I'm gonna grab the platform you grab the platform
[5756.62s -> 5761.98s]  below more to stop yourself from falling off in surprise than anything else the bird approaches
[5761.98s -> 5769.22s]  and swoops low the priest screams then a moment later he is gone and the bird is flapping gently
[5769.22s -> 5774.98s]  away you are alone there is nothing on the platform apart from a few stray spots of blood
[5774.98s -> 5782.86s]  from where the winged creature's talons punctured the man's side and the jeweled medallion oh no
[5784.42s -> 5804.70s]  save him uh see the future oh no I I think I think we're I think he's I think he's gone
[5806.31s -> 5812.41s]  he's gone you can see him getting fucking eaten save him you're a monster say I can't
[5813.38s -> 5825.75s]  all I can do is cast zen hover down what about hot no rewind no I think it's all right
[5825.75s -> 5839.54s]  I think it's all right I don't have the medallion yet I just leap off all right I'm taking the
[5839.54s -> 5845.32s]  medallion this probably explains how we got up the pole in the first place okay I'm going let's
[5845.32s -> 5853.22s]  okay rewind you monster can't rewind everything I can't I got some decisions have to be final
[5854.10s -> 5866.78s]  what do I sit on the pole the spell was free right sit on the pole you float down onto the
[5866.78s -> 5872.46s]  pole's platform and cross your legs to contemplate the sun a few meditative minutes go by and you
[5872.46s -> 5880.23s]  feel cleansed and well rested oh time passes a moment later you feel a great weight settle
[5880.23s -> 5884.39s]  about your shoulders it is your body weight returning your spell has evaporated and you're
[5884.39s -> 5890.92s]  now stuck at the top of this gigantic pole in the distance a dark speck appears above the forest
[5890.92s -> 5904.41s]  is the bird coming back for another like meal there's a wait wait and watch the dark spot
[5904.41s -> 5909.21s]  resolves into a bird-like shape and swoops low a moment later you have been snatched up into the
[5909.21s -> 5929.37s]  air by the sharp talons where are we going carried away great wings beat above you you wriggle and
[5929.37s -> 5935.30s]  struggle but there's no safe way down below the steps transform into thick tangled forest
[5935.30s -> 5943.91s]  we do have the ape what if I try to talk to the bird talk to the bird or pray to the ape climb
[5943.91s -> 5956.95s]  the creature I like that one let me go you demand of the great bird hoping it perhaps can understand
[5956.95s -> 5964.38s]  the common tongue even if it can't speak it and indeed perhaps it can the talons begin to slide
[5964.38s -> 5971.96s]  from your flesh and you are about to fall grab hold on wait you grab for the creature's feet
[5971.96s -> 5977.88s]  and it lashes back kicking you sharply in the face the talons retract and you are tumbling
[5977.88s -> 5991.02s]  you're tumbling downwards through the air towards the canopy why did I do that you plunge to earth
[5991.02s -> 5995.98s]  the trees breaking your fall miraculously you are largely unscathed by your ordeal
[5996.70s -> 6005.62s]  get up you pause as a thin red colored snake slides across your path this fucking snake
[6005.62s -> 6012.86s]  what if I play what if I play the flute imagine going through all what I just went through
[6013.50s -> 6022.31s]  and then being like no it's time to like you play a flute a few notes on the flute but it seems you
[6022.31s -> 6028.01s]  are no talented snake charmer the snake appears to be watching you but then it lowers its head
[6028.01s -> 6043.08s]  once more and begins to slither away down the path yep I can become a giant or I can summon
[6043.08s -> 6058.30s]  a giant rap talk all languages no it's a snake I'm gonna follow the snake you follow the snake
[6058.30s -> 6064.86s]  into the undergrowth for a moment you lose sight of the creature then a flash of red reassures you
[6064.86s -> 6071.38s]  that you are still on its tail but the snake should be far ahead of you it is almost as if it
[6071.38s -> 6082.57s]  wants you to follow the snake reaches the foot of a tree and coils around the trunk okay as you watch
[6082.57s -> 6087.85s]  the snake slithers quickly up the trunk a moment later its head drops down from a branch to stare
[6087.85s -> 6099.88s]  at you you approach the tree catching a glimpse of a thick red band in the branches and suddenly
[6099.88s -> 6112.23s]  the whole thing erupts into flame charge forward you charge forward convince the flame is an illusion
[6112.95s -> 6118.79s]  it is not and you feel burning heat on your skin but just as soon as it began the fire goes out
[6119.35s -> 6125.59s]  leaving a badly charred tree looking up into the branches you see the red snake peering down at you
[6125.59s -> 6131.37s]  it has grown tenfold in size and two fiery wings are now folded across its back
[6131.37s -> 6140.73s]  sly eyes watch your movements as if deciding its next attack you stare in shock and fear the blaze
[6140.73s -> 6180.86s]  of hissing fiery must be the fire serpent sap i don't have the ring um stench speed i could go
[6180.86s -> 6200.14s]  really super fast float in the air sap let me say something about the water i don't have like a
[6200.14s -> 6219.88s]  water spell fireball why would i do fire against fire wind i could just cause it out i'm gonna do
[6219.88s -> 6230.55s]  gale horn i'm blowing the horn and i'm causing a fucking tornado here tornado let's go oh boy
[6230.55s -> 6234.55s]  consulting the constellations above you bind the spell placing your gale horn to your lips and
[6234.55s -> 6240.95s]  playing a clear tone a strong wind is summoned from the horn that blows down the serpent's fires
[6240.95s -> 6247.19s]  it hisses in fury and frustration and falls from the tree to attack you but without its flames it
[6247.19s -> 6257.82s]  is severely weakened dude how am i okay i gotta play well uh you've got much more attack power
[6257.82s -> 6265.78s]  than i do i'm gonna hold off good thing all right now i can i gotta do some stamina management
[6266.66s -> 6273.03s]  crash against your defense the creature coils its scaly body okay it's getting ready
[6273.03s -> 6286.66s]  does that mean it's gonna attack i'm gonna go like 3.6 good good like stab cuts through the
[6286.66s -> 6291.38s]  serpent scales the serpent is rearing back but you catch it as it retreats so it's rearing back
[6291.38s -> 6299.35s]  now i think i'm going all in yep good call what an unbelievable fucking sword play that was
[6300.47s -> 6306.18s]  your only hope is to keep up the attack you do not hold back laid high above your head the serpent
[6306.18s -> 6312.50s]  is rearing for you you drive your blade into its open jaw the serpent's fire flickers you'll die
[6313.14s -> 6321.08s]  i can do better than that you will die here fire licks the edges of the serpent's mouth
[6321.08s -> 6335.18s]  i'm going again you will die here alone the creature's claws draw inwards all right it's
[6335.18s -> 6344.63s]  not going to attack but i think it has way more than i can yes 1.6 all right i have to defend i
[6344.63s -> 6351.48s]  need to build this back up you jab and step back the snake is clearly fearful moving back attempting
[6351.48s -> 6357.56s]  only a minor attack a line of fire streaks along the length of the serpent it's gonna come all in
[6358.28s -> 6366.31s]  good you draw back as the serpent arcs forward quickly sidestepping the creature
[6366.31s -> 6372.46s]  smashes into the bushes behind sending a wall of sparks snake eyes narrow and watch you
[6372.46s -> 6385.86s]  just did 4.4 i'm going all in all right uh he's got a ton of power now i'm gonna hold back the
[6385.86s -> 6390.18s]  flames around the creature flicker a deep dark red the creature seems to flash with heat yep
[6390.18s -> 6398.87s]  here comes a big one kind of all right the creature flies a short distance into the air
[6398.87s -> 6405.05s]  i think it's probably gonna defend the bat was harder than this dude uh i'm gonna defend twice
[6406.23s -> 6414.86s]  shit that was a stupid idea now we both are gonna serpent lashes out quickly with the tip of its
[6414.86s -> 6421.45s]  tail didn't dive in heat rises from the creature scales all right is it gonna be more than 6.7
[6421.45s -> 6426.17s]  all in that's really unfortunate because that's horrible i just took four fucking damage
[6426.17s -> 6438.79s]  it's really unfortunate the serpent's fire grows dull after that all in again it's all right fire
[6438.79s -> 6445.64s]  serpent rears back escaping the worst of the blow the creature shifts back a little i'm gonna
[6445.64s -> 6456.34s]  die fire creeps around the open jaws i don't have enough yep see but now i do okay creature turns
[6456.34s -> 6467.69s]  its fire okay turns let's do four four point five again all in five point three all in no i'm dead
[6468.33s -> 6492.01s]  no shit oh that was risky that was risky oh damn it it's okay i got so unlucky then all right all
[6492.01s -> 6503.96s]  right all right so i'm gonna go at four point four point oh good four point oh six point oh
[6505.98s -> 6512.66s]  really good start serpents fire flickers the creature's claws draw inwards okay two point
[6512.66s -> 6521.75s]  seven you're not going for an attack you draw any claws in oh shut up lost by all right i'm
[6521.75s -> 6529.93s]  being watched defend i didn't have one point six a line of fire streaks along the okay i think it's
[6529.93s -> 6537.70s]  coming in for an attack it's gonna be more than four yep all right now i have the advantage it's
[6537.70s -> 6545.88s]  going in the air it's probably it's gonna do a little tail whip let's do four point eight okay
[6545.88s -> 6551.66s]  the fire grows dull all right i'm doing literally point eight no one point oh it's safe right one
[6551.66s -> 6560.20s]  point two oh that's all right the creature flies in the air opening its jaws wide all right it's
[6560.20s -> 6571.38s]  gonna be a huge one you only got like four or five after that flash with heat i think you're coming
[6571.38s -> 6583.10s]  in twice yep creature retreats a little into the trees all right all in again that's fine um i have
[6583.10s -> 6591.88s]  complete advantage defend okay i think a big one's coming in the fearsome serpent rears its full
[6591.88s -> 6600.71s]  height up into the air oh yeah this should be a win right now it's gonna turn let's do like
[6600.71s -> 6608.23s]  three point eight good one more of those all in heat rises from the creature scales all in
[6610.12s -> 6622.86s]  dead is that panic you see in its eyes or murderous intent you risk another heavy cut the fire
[6622.86s -> 6630.36s]  serpent's eyes turn coal black and it looks upon at you questioning helpless in the final second
[6630.36s -> 6645.38s]  before it turns to a dark dead husk you step back wiping your brow sword heavy in your hand
[6646.41s -> 6653.40s]  you have now defeated three of the seven serpents you need to rest and recover your
[6653.40s -> 6671.72s]  search for the serpents is so far taking its toll you move on through the trees yay back
[6671.72s -> 6680.20s]  wait where are we right now that was interesting how that played out i fucked around here for
[6680.20s -> 6688.90s]  too long my buddy got grabbed maybe killed and eaten i got grabbed i fought to get let go i drop
[6688.90s -> 6696.52s]  right here snake is right here that's that was cool you gotta go get the water snake in the lake
[6696.52s -> 6706.20s]  yeah that's true i need to get over here all right the the game plan is still intact i wanted to go
[6706.76s -> 6720.28s]  this way because i want to activate this beacon things scurry in the branches all around you
[6720.28s -> 6725.62s]  clouds rumble as they roll across the darkening sky the path looks wide and well used but there
[6725.62s -> 6732.31s]  are no signs of who or what uses it then a little further along you reach a spot where the trail is
[6732.31s -> 6744.39s]  suddenly narrower with bushes tight on either side let's take a look oh dear you pause to look
[6744.39s -> 6750.63s]  at the bush and see that its branches are twitching ever so slightly curling and uncurling like
[6750.63s -> 6764.02s]  reaching fingers i don't think i want to walk through that squeeze forward is not the play
[6764.02s -> 6774.28s]  it's not the game plan i think i draw my sword and try to cut away at some stuff you draw your
[6774.28s -> 6780.28s]  long sword warily the branches seem to curve back as though recoiling but surely it's simply
[6780.28s -> 6783.96s]  the breeze i don't want to lose this sword if they grab it i think i'm just gonna i don't know i
[6783.96s -> 6797.90s]  think i'm turning around i'm gonna leave because i'm more of a punk kind of guy who listens to rock
[6799.18s -> 6805.43s]  wait what not someone who watches germa sorry i mean i'm kind of a punk rock guy i don't want
[6805.43s -> 6818.74s]  to be here all right that's i like that comment that's fucking funny oh i don't want to like
[6819.70s -> 6829.00s]  okay you draw your i mean this is clearly dangerous i'm gonna go in here and it's
[6829.00s -> 6835.85s]  gonna hurt me for like eight damage i'm turning around i'm not doing this is this is very clearly
[6835.85s -> 6845.18s]  that dangerous situation that i don't want to put myself in risk on i have to leave i'm kind of a
[6845.18s -> 6855.53s]  punk rock kind of guy don't just squeeze in there i'm sorry i'm going in you squeeze your way forward
[6855.53s -> 6860.09s]  between two bushes which have overgrown the path only to find yourself quickly tangled in them
[6860.54s -> 6866.06s]  it is lucky the sight masters cannot see this far it would be embarrassing if the sergeant could
[6866.06s -> 6874.12s]  see you now swing my sword you raise your long sword to hack away the branches they react faster
[6874.12s -> 6880.78s]  this time long wooden tendrils whip out grasping your wrists your wrists and arms you cannot swing
[6880.78s -> 6888.66s]  your sword now and meanwhile another tendril is looping itself around your neck maybe the
[6888.66s -> 6895.22s]  ape can come and help us here i'm gonna pray to the ape you close your eyes and raise a prayer to
[6895.22s -> 6904.17s]  the ape but nothing seems to change the bush keeps tightening its grip around your neck
[6904.17s -> 6909.29s]  you look to the heavens to cast a spell but your arms are held fast by the strangle bush
[6909.29s -> 6916.46s]  and so you cannot craft any magic the vice-like grip tightens it's beginning to pull your body
[6916.46s -> 6923.03s]  in two directions the grip of the strangle bush is turning to steel around your arms and neck
[6923.03s -> 6923.83s]  you can barely
[6929.80s -> 6935.56s]  you struggle and thrash and then finally the ape comes to your aid as the moon rises brightly
[6935.56s -> 6941.32s]  and the bush turns involuntarily reaching upwards instead of towards you you waste no time in
[6941.32s -> 6956.41s]  slipping clear you shiver wanted to leave this spot as fast as you can the ape i think it's funny
[6956.41s -> 6964.73s]  because there's the ape and there's also the monkey right well there's a there's a few different
[6964.73s -> 6969.83s]  apes and isn't the monkey like doesn't monkey laugh at you sometimes if bad things are happening
[6969.83s -> 6979.96s]  to you i remember praying to the monkey and it was like the monkey uh you can hear the distant
[6979.96s -> 6989.72s]  laughs of like howling laughter as the monkey like watches you get like hurt all right i just
[6989.72s -> 7002.20s]  distinctly remember that happening okay well let's go ape has been really good to us though
[7002.20s -> 7007.59s]  the path winds tortuously through the forest you still feel shaky from your encounter with
[7007.59s -> 7015.38s]  the strangle bush i didn't even get hurt actually probably the best way to do that
[7015.38s -> 7020.60s]  are you gonna play final fantasy 16 today um i thought about it but i think we're into this
[7020.60s -> 7027.14s]  right now i'd rather get to a good stopping point here i mean i'm not the stream's not
[7027.14s -> 7043.78s]  over i'm just saying that probably not lies of jay yep look the high council of the sorcery
[7043.78s -> 7051.96s]  enjoyers have been waiting 296 days for this you know what i mean i think we we owe them a little
[7051.96s -> 7061.99s]  a little extra the path winds time to move you must find your way to the shore of lake eclala
[7061.99s -> 7070.20s]  somehow it seems impossible and yet it must be a way the seers in aniland saw a path
[7070.20s -> 7077.98s]  dangerous fickle but present you must find it i wonder what happens if you stay with the bird
[7077.98s -> 7082.30s]  this is probably like a big bird's nest it's probably i wonder if he's here that like other
[7082.30s -> 7095.70s]  magician guy i'm almost out of food again all right you walk on between the trees another night
[7095.70s -> 7105.66s]  begins you need to rest in the snata forest this is not good but whatever laying your pack down
[7105.66s -> 7109.26s]  by the roots of a tree you try to stretch out despite the unsettling noises in the trees
[7110.62s -> 7119.21s]  i have eaten today right yeah you stretch out and rest you dream you are trapped in a low straw hut
[7119.21s -> 7125.77s]  its door sealed with bolts made of bones a small fire is burning in one corner it quickly spreads
[7126.41s -> 7131.56s]  until you are surrounded by flame you feel yourself starting to sweat from the heat
[7131.56s -> 7145.16s]  and you wake up to find a ball of fire raging mere inches from you look at it jesus the fire
[7145.16s -> 7151.08s]  does not seem to be fueled it is a ball about three feet wide gushing with smoke and steam
[7151.64s -> 7158.58s]  a moment later it unravels uncurling into a long animal form it is a fire fox and it's coming for
[7158.58s -> 7177.82s]  your neck in a blaze of fur and fire sharpen blade this rock which is turned to stone
[7183.37s -> 7193.46s]  fog summon darkness oh that's kind of cool i imagine when this bell gets cast
[7193.46s -> 7199.32s]  it plays the diablo 2 sound effect you know the one i'm talking about the one that goes
[7199.88s -> 7205.67s]  oh you know that one that like
[7209.51s -> 7231.05s]  when the darkness is summoned in act two the fox is made of light you dope i could like stink but
[7231.05s -> 7249.70s]  i can't do it fire is not a good idea i'm summoning darkness i think it's fun or i could do a force
[7249.70s -> 7256.18s]  no let's summon darkness let's just who cares fuck it let's go you move the stars into alignment
[7256.18s -> 7262.82s]  around you in clouds of dark fog bill about from under clothing your clothing but they are quickly
[7262.82s -> 7271.99s]  lost to the winds okay well i have to fight it uh we're going all in good idea three damage points
[7272.87s -> 7279.83s]  all in again the fire fox paces the earth before you sparks a fire flashing across its fur driven
[7279.83s -> 7286.46s]  by fear you charge headlong it snaps at you which your blow lands in a spurt of blood and fur
[7287.18s -> 7291.50s]  it limps back bleeding heavily dark blue flames gutter between clumps of ragged fur
[7292.06s -> 7304.58s]  all in again it's gonna be close uh i oh that was really painful you feel yourself weakening
[7304.58s -> 7318.76s]  that's not good at all that's the worst thing that could happen yes get that sneaky 1.6 okay
[7320.65s -> 7332.15s]  we're a big one's coming really the firefox drops to a crouch are you gonna defend again
[7332.63s -> 7341.45s]  i don't know that's all right okay but he killed me shit i thought it was i thought it was gonna
[7341.45s -> 7351.10s]  be one damage i took i did two hell the firefox's jaws close around your throat as it tears its head

[7531.26s -> 7535.42s]  i'm running away i'm not getting soft-locked i already did this i'm out of here see you later
[7535.42s -> 7550.89s]  goodbye chad fox versus virgin jeremy this is the sorcery enjoyers high council we just wanted to
[7550.89s -> 7555.05s]  say thank you very much for playing this again this game does not get enough love and it's
[7555.05s -> 7560.49s]  wonderful seeing so many people enjoying it council is few in numbers but our hearts are big for these
[7560.49s -> 7567.59s]  books and games so we thank you for playing and entertaining our little jokes hey i love this game
[7567.59s -> 7574.55s]  this is like this is like how i started on twitch this is this holds a very very deep
[7574.55s -> 7585.19s]  sentimental value to me so yeah i love this this is great okay i'm just gonna keep moving
[7585.19s -> 7594.25s]  i'm not sleeping i'm not gonna get attacked by a firefox back to the town the path leads into the
[7594.25s -> 7607.14s]  village oh i could go into the village again at night this might be a bad idea oh i'm not big
[7607.14s -> 7614.94s]  anymore they're not they don't care push my way in i could get big again will they think it's cool
[7620.09s -> 7634.65s]  they took it from me i can't kid create illusions god illusion of worship i don't have a gold jewel
[7637.67s -> 7648.42s]  read minds sense danger i guess i could i could try um what else is there
[7649.96s -> 7658.73s]  rap tall talk all languages don't we talk this wait pulling out the green wig you wear it and
[7658.73s -> 7662.81s]  cast a spell but the clathamen are not speaking so there is no language for you to understand
[7670.52s -> 7676.30s]  what do you want you ask the clathamen look at you without expressions if they
[7676.38s -> 7685.19s]  if they have understood you they gave no sign let me pass you demand they remove the wig in
[7685.19s -> 7698.06s]  irritation i just think have this green wig on darn it whatever put my wig away i can't they
[7698.06s -> 7704.14s]  won't let me do big again they want they don't want me to do it again i guess i'm just gonna
[7704.14s -> 7710.74s]  have to pay i'm gonna run out of money what about kid create an illusion requires a bracelet of bone
[7711.30s -> 7718.86s]  let's do it you move the stars into alignment around you and the bracelet at your wrist begins
[7718.86s -> 7724.68s]  to glow you have just a moment in which to choose your illusion turn myself invisible turn myself
[7724.68s -> 7734.06s]  into a monster monster they like when i was big remember when i got huge they were like come on
[7734.06s -> 7743.03s]  in you create the illusion that you are towering infernal beast but the clathamen barely react
[7743.03s -> 7749.06s]  it seems they are too stupid to find you threatening what there's nothing you can do
[7749.06s -> 7760.71s]  but wait for the spell to fade and try something you hand over two gold pieces the clathamen
[7760.71s -> 7765.45s]  nearest to you seems to love the shininess and takes the coins the other stands aside to let
[7765.45s -> 7771.05s]  you pass they do not speak but when motions towards a fire where an animal is roasting on a spit
[7771.05s -> 7788.20s]  okay well you look around the weird houses by the fire you make your way to a space by the fire
[7788.20s -> 7793.88s]  several clathamen and clathawomen are sprawled around singing songs that consist of barks and
[7793.88s -> 7800.10s]  squawks and occasionally turning a roach pig of roach pig on a spit reminding you of the poachers
[7800.10s -> 7805.18s]  you met in kare one stands as you arrive slapping her chest and then her head in some kind of
[7805.18s -> 7810.98s]  greeting i'm not doing that i'm not doing that i don't know i don't know what that what i'm
[7810.98s -> 7818.50s]  i don't know what i'm saying i don't know what that means i'm just gonna say hi greetings they
[7818.50s -> 7827.70s]  don't understand speech she slaps herself again i return the gesture return her gesture you reply
[7827.70s -> 7833.42s]  with the same gesture and the clatham woman stares in amazement then falls about laughing
[7833.42s -> 7841.46s]  she repeats the gesture again what what am i doing all right repeat the gesture myself
[7841.46s -> 7847.03s]  you repeat the gesture again the clatham woman's eyes seem to all but pop out suddenly
[7847.03s -> 7852.71s]  she leans forward and smiles strangely drawing up her lips and showing her teeth which she then
[7852.71s -> 7858.25s]  begins to pick this continues for a moment but when nothing happens she stops in evident
[7858.25s -> 7864.34s]  puzzlement perhaps she thought she was looking into a mirror one of the clatham and by the fire
[7864.34s -> 7871.85s]  waves you over and tears off a leg of a pig i mean i haven't eaten you accept the roast meat which
[7871.85s -> 7876.97s]  is almost raw and barely palatable another of the clatham and brings you a mug of tea like broth
[7876.97s -> 7889.26s]  that accompanies the meat the way of running nose accompanies a feverish cold jesus uh okay eat
[7889.82s -> 7896.09s]  more i should probably have i wonder if they might know something about the serpents i wonder ask
[7896.09s -> 7904.33s]  about the serpents do you know of the seven serpents you ask one of the clatham and stiffens
[7904.33s -> 7910.52s]  at the words perhaps he recognizes them or has heard them from someone else either way he begins
[7910.52s -> 7915.64s]  to point vigorously at the fire with one hand while with another he lifts a handful of dust
[7915.64s -> 7920.74s]  from the ground and makes it as if to throw it on the flames you realize he is telling you the
[7920.74s -> 7931.99s]  weakness of the fire serpent sand oh sure wish i knew this he's already dead this is where i take
[7931.99s -> 7940.10s]  out like i just i pull out like the serpent's head i already got him he repeats this pattern
[7940.10s -> 7946.63s]  a few times before seeming to forget what he's doing and sitting back in silence let's have
[7946.63s -> 7952.33s]  another piece of pig you tear off another leg of pig and munch down on it the clatham and seem
[7952.33s -> 7957.59s]  content presumably living so close to the forest they have a good supply of creatures to hunt
[7957.59s -> 7966.62s]  suddenly there is a sound behind you followed by a hushed silence turning you see a well built
[7966.62s -> 7973.45s]  clatham in taller and stronger than the rest approaching with unsteady gate before you can
[7973.45s -> 7979.66s]  react he lifts you and tosses you across the fire to a patch of ground near the gate am i
[7979.66s -> 7989.02s]  getting kicked out oh i thought they were throwing me out the arena the large clatham and stumbles
[7989.02s -> 7999.30s]  after you growling loudly you cannot understand his meaning then he raises a large club oh uh
[8000.18s -> 8021.24s]  greetings is he is he coked up wait law control non-intelligent creatures this dud illusion of
[8021.24s -> 8037.64s]  treasure there's sap i could cause depression gack which is fear i don't have the mask law
[8037.64s -> 8047.94s]  is expensive but it would probably work do it you craft the spell and begin to attempt to take
[8047.94s -> 8054.10s]  control of the clatham's mind spell only works on unintelligent creatures now you will find out if
[8054.10s -> 8061.38s]  they are truly if they truly are unintelligent the clatham and raises his club to swing it down on
[8061.38s -> 8071.70s]  your head i really hope you're stupid make him strike himself down you hold your nerve trusting
[8071.70s -> 8080.14s]  to your spell the clatham's great biceps tense and then the club comes crashing down hitting
[8080.14s -> 8087.18s]  into the clatham's own groin his eyeballs twist about in their sockets like flowers turning towards
[8087.18s -> 8095.30s]  a sudden ray of sunshine then his face turns a deep shade of blue and he sinks into the he sinks
[8095.30s -> 8104.41s]  to the dust he turned he turned blue by hitting himself in his his own balls okay the other
[8104.41s -> 8110.89s]  clatham and around the fire nod appreciatively they seem to consider this a fair ordinary fight
[8110.89s -> 8115.69s]  and you are the clear victor the other clatham and go and find their fallen champion one of the
[8115.69s -> 8121.46s]  clatter women slaps you on the back making you cough and splutter another clatham and beckons
[8121.46s -> 8133.62s]  from outside a nearby tent his face is painted with strange spirals and markings okay let's go
[8136.95s -> 8142.07s]  you head over to the beckoning clatham man from his tent you catch faint wisps of strange herbal
[8142.07s -> 8153.22s]  smells get over here attack him uh let's greet you nod a greeting which he returns
[8153.78s -> 8159.77s]  placing both hands on either side of your face then he begins to murmur a strange blessing
[8159.77s -> 8167.30s]  you feel strength filtering deep into your bones his gift is a powerful one and deep when you
[8167.30s -> 8177.72s]  step back you feel stronger taller and more confident got a max health upgrade thank him
[8177.72s -> 8187.30s]  you bow and thanks he smiles and walks away from the fire any more serpents intrigued by
[8187.30s -> 8192.38s]  the clatham man's first clue you try and ask him about the serpents once more but he merely
[8192.38s -> 8200.12s]  repeats the same performance try communicating further you look around for something to use to
[8200.12s -> 8208.90s]  communicate further point into the teacup point at my sword point into the teacup you point down
[8208.90s -> 8215.59s]  into the water in a nearby teacup and the clatham and nods grabbing a handful of burning fat from
[8215.59s -> 8221.40s]  the pig on the spit he tosses it into the cup the clatham and whose cup it was becomes enraged
[8221.40s -> 8230.55s]  and the two begin beating each other around the head with rocks still perhaps it is a clue should
[8230.55s -> 8242.73s]  you try something else i love these guys all right point at the ground you stamp on the ground one
[8242.73s -> 8248.09s]  of the clatham women shakes her head perhaps they do not know how to defeat the earth serpent or
[8248.09s -> 8254.07s]  perhaps they think you are asking if you can plant vegetables here it's impossible to tell
[8254.07s -> 8263.74s]  one clatham it picks up a stone and then punches it is that a clue what about the sword my sword
[8263.74s -> 8268.98s]  you indicate your sword and the clatham and nod to one another but it's unclear what they are saying
[8268.98s -> 8275.00s]  perhaps they simply like swords enough of talking to these idiots it is like communicating with a
[8275.16s -> 8284.33s]  trained dog what the fuck what about the forest what can you tell me of the forest of snata you
[8284.33s -> 8290.47s]  ask the creatures look between one another blankly for all their human shape they do not seem to have
[8290.47s -> 8297.46s]  a human thought in their heads you stand and take your leave of the fire okay i could probably get
[8297.46s -> 8306.63s]  a night's sleep here though one corner of the camp is slung with hammocks what they are for is
[8306.63s -> 8313.67s]  unclear as the clatham folk seem to have tents but a few creatures are asleep in them already
[8313.67s -> 8318.39s]  you haul yourself up into one of the hammocks they're far from they are far too large for a
[8318.39s -> 8323.03s]  normal human but this in fact makes it only more comfortable and ensures there's enough room for
[8323.03s -> 8331.78s]  your pack i think i'm safer you stretch out and rest you seem left alone here and your night is
[8331.78s -> 8340.04s]  untroubled by dreams during the past day you gained a little max stamina change to using the
[8340.04s -> 8346.34s]  long sword used one provision and some gold enter the steps and you collected the sun serpent and
[8346.34s -> 8356.78s]  the fire serpent meaning there are four still out there next morning i'm going to get a send
[8356.78s -> 8363.66s]  off from the clatham in you wake after a peaceful night in one of the hammocks feeling much refreshed
[8363.66s -> 8380.94s]  i think that's it appreciate it thanks for the help get out of here thanks a lot i have much
[8380.94s -> 8390.26s]  respect for the clatham folk you should ever need anything do not hesitate to call there are no
[8390.26s -> 8401.26s]  phones i've ruined everything all right let's go down you keep moving the ground dropping a little
[8401.26s -> 8407.40s]  there moves a little still icy but fresh to the southeast a huge mountaintop rises its peak
[8407.40s -> 8415.70s]  dusted with snow it is the southern extent of the horns of iklala near its base is a carved shape
[8415.70s -> 8423.38s]  a turreted tower built into the stone of the slope you march onwards all right we want to go here
[8428.94s -> 8434.06s]  you fall into a steady pace as you walk ascending and descending the moaning winds tug at your pack
[8434.06s -> 8441.18s]  and sword the scrub land is broken quite suddenly by a small waist-high post to which is a nailed
[8441.18s -> 8450.63s]  written notice you pause to read the sign the writing is crabby and difficult but you slowly
[8450.63s -> 8460.44s]  decipher it stop traveler every wish can come true for this post marks the grave of the god
[8463.82s -> 8483.78s]  call name close to see your eyes blessed forthwith call the name vinanga rose shift button is broken
[8484.34s -> 8496.49s]  uh let's go ahead and you know you know the one we're doing you cast sus the voice indicates
[8496.49s -> 8506.82s]  that there is some danger here but it does not specify what it is be careful all right i don't
[8506.82s -> 8522.86s]  know what happens if i do this should i say it i say vinanga vinanga you stand carefully by the
[8522.86s -> 8528.79s]  post and call out vinanga to the empty air nothing seems to change there is no sense of danger or
[8528.79s -> 8538.34s]  blessing in the air wait i have to close my eyes you close your eyes as the note instructed
[8538.34s -> 8548.15s]  nothing happens you sense no danger vinanga you call out again but there is still no response
[8548.15s -> 8559.19s]  then you feel something move under your feet wait you wait and then your stomach churns you are
[8559.19s -> 8565.64s]  falling you tumble landing in the bottom of a conical sandpit that has opened beneath your
[8565.64s -> 8585.93s]  feet the top of the post is now only just visible sticking out of the dirt at the bottom of the pit
[8585.93s -> 8592.25s]  yes invisibility oh this is a good place for it too i'm so glad i picked up so many of these
[8592.25s -> 8597.13s]  items in this first and second game there's something that you don't know uh you actually
[8597.13s -> 8600.97s]  can do playthroughs of this game and not have any of these items and it like sucks because like
[8600.97s -> 8607.34s]  fuck i want to do i want to do that i don't have the item let's do it let's go invisible i want
[8607.34s -> 8617.77s]  let's see it doesn't cost any stamina slip on the pearl ring and cast the spell and slowly a filmy
[8617.77s -> 8622.65s]  light extends from the jewel of the ring surrounding your body something stirs in the
[8622.65s -> 8630.73s]  dirt underfoot let's dig you dig a little into the sand around the base of the pit after a few
[8630.73s -> 8636.50s]  minutes you uncover the bottom of the pole and beneath it a chain this is part of some mechanical
[8636.50s -> 8644.52s]  contraption a claw appears through the sand in the side of the pit are we just gonna are we is
[8644.52s -> 8659.27s]  this a way i'm gonna unclog the drain here pull on the chain oh shit okay you tug the chain and
[8659.35s -> 8663.75s]  the floor of the pit shivers slightly but you're not strong enough to haul the post back
[8663.75s -> 8668.92s]  the side of the pit collapses as a baby badu beetle emerges there's no time to do anything
[8668.92s -> 8678.25s]  but draw your sword this is this thing is stronger than a serpent yeah i don't even have 11 stamina
[8678.25s -> 8687.85s]  11 power i have eight stiffens and rears up we're gonna go very small like 2.8 good okay that's
[8687.85s -> 8695.54s]  clean you aim a blow for its bug eyes the badu beetle mid-lunge bends away from your blade the
[8695.54s -> 8703.05s]  creature is losing its spines one by one all right we go again i think 4.2 good it's skillful
[8703.69s -> 8710.68s]  okay green blood oozes from between the beetle scales its long claws stretch i think it's ready
[8710.68s -> 8720.12s]  to come in defend good call good call okay you fall over yourself trying to escape it's a reach
[8720.12s -> 8730.38s]  it straightens up just i think i'm going straightens up all in stupid but i still got it
[8731.26s -> 8738.44s]  you prepare your sword you swing hard the battle beetle leans aside avoiding most of the blow
[8738.44s -> 8746.25s]  okay probably coming in hard no all right that's fine we'll both do it you circle away from the
[8746.25s -> 8751.66s]  battle beetle it circles the other way creatures vicious claws open and close i think that means
[8751.66s -> 8759.22s]  like snap snap snap snap snap snap snap like i'm coming in yep all right now i have all the control
[8759.22s -> 8767.46s]  here we're going in at like a two point we're going to like 2.5 it scuttles backwards it's okay
[8767.46s -> 8773.14s]  that's all right now we're going it waggles its antenna tilting its head full blast
[8775.16s -> 8783.45s]  i'm winning so it's okay this is fine battle beetle bugs the badu beetle bug stumbles and
[8783.45s -> 8791.43s]  its jaws stretch wide in rage the thing's cruel claw claws grasp at the air i think it has a lot
[8791.43s -> 8799.70s]  i'm gonna defend yep it waggles its spiny arms in a strange motion and stands erect for a moment
[8799.70s -> 8804.58s]  all right well we're going in it i have to go in you never know you never know it could have been
[8805.46s -> 8813.94s]  honestly look at how much bigger the bar is you just got way more to work with scuttles forward
[8813.94s -> 8824.92s]  and i could have probably no i couldn't it stiffens i think i'm going all in still winning
[8825.56s -> 8835.32s]  defend all right that's fine i think coming in for as high lens begins to dig in the dirt all in
[8835.32s -> 8847.13s]  nope defend it shifts sideways okay if he goes all in i'm in trouble i'm gonna defend again okay
[8848.20s -> 8859.93s]  uh its back legs throw up more sand it's coming in for a full like 12.0 oh my god do it already
[8859.93s -> 8869.94s]  it stoops down endlessly patient it hurries a few steps back do it already i don't want to
[8869.94s -> 8879.06s]  okay it rears up really a 2.3 you smart piece of shit because now you still have enough to
[8879.06s -> 8885.85s]  beat me if i go all in i'm going i don't care oh my fucking god what a disaster
[8889.64s -> 8903.80s]  oh my god a huge this is a this is awful this is really bad i got him that was so annoying
[8903.80s -> 8913.22s]  outsmarted by a bug you rush forward and stab then your blade lands deep you cut again twist
[8913.22s -> 8920.70s]  and the badu beetle collapses on the dust the beetle has died on its back you could scramble
[8920.70s -> 8928.65s]  up its body to get close to the edge of the pit let's look at the beetle first you look over the
[8928.65s -> 8937.50s]  dead beetle around one leg is a small metal tag on which is inscribed the word benanga most curious
[8937.50s -> 8943.69s]  benanga is the name of the beetle it's not a god or like a priest or it's literally the name of
[8943.69s -> 8960.23s]  the beetle that somebody put here somebody was warning me stop traveler every wish can come true
[8960.23s -> 8974.06s]  for this post marks the grave of the god benanga who put this here i'm climbing up the beetle's
[8974.06s -> 8981.50s]  body you clamor onto the beetle's hind legs then scramble by leg by leg up the body to the edge
[8981.50s -> 8986.71s]  of the pit the beetle's body shifts under your weight and you clamor out just in time as it
[8986.71s -> 8993.51s]  slides down out of reach look into the pit the dead beetle's body lies in the bottom of the pit
[8993.51s -> 9002.38s]  you leave the side of the pit you continue to walk okay well that was eventful uh let's go
[9002.38s -> 9008.58s]  over here first i guess i want to turn this on actually no let's explore all this so then i can
[9008.58s -> 9022.04s]  turn it to the past let's explore all of everything in the present first it's the best way to do it
[9022.04s -> 9028.81s]  okay you march onwards climbing slightly the dewy light from your pearl ring fades and disappears
[9028.81s -> 9044.33s]  but i was invisible that whole time how did i you smell me i was invisible you notice something
[9044.33s -> 9053.46s]  white stark against the gray of the dust look at it it's just a sliver of cool white visible
[9053.46s -> 9060.84s]  through the thin dusty scrub something is buried here clear the dust you wipe away the dust from
[9060.84s -> 9069.08s]  the object it is short dirty white and gently curved take it up you dig around the object
[9069.08s -> 9075.18s]  and find two similar objects to the left and right of it they lie parallel in the dirt keep
[9075.18s -> 9082.66s]  going you squat down on your heels and dig in the dirt a little more eventually you uncover three
[9082.66s -> 9089.42s]  short white rods and at that moment it becomes obvious that they are finger bones of a hand
[9089.42s -> 9095.19s]  clenched into a fist the fist points upwards as though its owner had been buried standing
[9095.19s -> 9105.02s]  upright in the soil keep digging you keep digging the fist gives way to a wrist and then an arm
[9105.02s -> 9110.63s]  it is as though the creature was trying to climb out when the soil of the land closed over its head
[9110.63s -> 9117.74s]  as you go lower the bones start to accumulate a leathery coating at first you think that it
[9117.74s -> 9124.44s]  is the remains of a coat but then once you locate an anchor and sail tattoo it becomes clear it is
[9124.44s -> 9136.17s]  skin somehow preserved in the soil you are now seriously digging which is hard work you pause
[9136.17s -> 9140.81s]  to take a break every few minutes and stop once more and you have the figure on earth down to the
[9140.81s -> 9149.56s]  waist its skull is a dried leather ball with two gray brown eyes shrunken in the sockets it wears
[9149.56s -> 9155.18s]  a metal ring through its nose and the remains of a beard are just visible its jacket is better
[9155.18s -> 9161.59s]  preserved its color faded but its buttons still intact it wears a small three-cornered hat
[9161.59s -> 9167.66s]  sticking just above the waist are the remains of some kind of harness it is possible this figure
[9167.66s -> 9182.97s]  had a false leg uh keep going oh it is hot now you're starting to sweat in your tunic you work
[9182.97s -> 9189.30s]  harder still creating a deep pit and getting down as far as the figure's knees one leg is indeed
[9189.30s -> 9203.64s]  wooden the other trouser clad bone you have the ape yep we're good keep going the sun has reached
[9203.64s -> 9209.98s]  its highest point now out of the shade the air is baking hot you dig down to the figure's feet
[9209.98s -> 9217.51s]  so it is standing proud in a five-foot hole water begins to pool around your feet heat beats down
[9217.51s -> 9223.88s]  from a cloudless sky the figure keels over face down against the dirt you've wasted a lot of time
[9223.88s -> 9233.48s]  on burying it but have discovered nothing search the figure you rival through the figure's jacket
[9233.48s -> 9241.03s]  but find nothing of interest in its pockets not even one gold piece take the hat you take the hat
[9241.03s -> 9248.36s]  from the creature's head but it is of little use it crumbles to dust in your hand more interesting
[9248.36s -> 9256.04s]  is what is left behind under the figure's thin covering of hair you can see a dry leathery scalp
[9256.04s -> 9265.54s]  inked with another tattoo you examine the tattoo carefully it shows two long thick lines that come
[9265.54s -> 9274.73s]  together to form a v at the top another stroke crosses so the shape becomes an inverted a inside
[9274.73s -> 9283.08s]  the top of the a near the tip is a black x inside an o perhaps it's a map but if so it is surely
[9283.08s -> 9293.59s]  too vague to read rebury the body you begin to pull dirt back into the pit intending to rebury
[9293.59s -> 9300.31s]  the body suddenly the creature in the pit begins to shiver and shake it is moving arms reaching out
[9300.31s -> 9309.80s]  to grasp you how do you skewer it it's a skeleton ah through the bones it's not gonna hurt doesn't
[9309.80s -> 9319.72s]  do anything he's got a tattoo map on top of his head um i'm gonna watch you watch in horror as
[9319.72s -> 9325.72s]  the eyeless creature drags itself up from the pit to the edge and stumbles and clatters away westward
[9325.72s -> 9332.14s]  across the steps it disappears into the dust though after a short while you hear a clattering
[9332.14s -> 9340.02s]  sound most likely the sound of its bones falling to bits around it look in the pit the pit is now
[9340.02s -> 9345.46s]  half filled with sparkling gleaming water there must be an underground river that is feeding it
[9345.46s -> 9363.75s]  you move quickly away from this ghoulish place okay there's this kind of rundown building
[9364.39s -> 9372.26s]  because these stones are already up here or i can turn on the device this thing i would like to
[9372.26s -> 9381.43s]  explore first so let's go here we can turn this back later you walk on the ground dropping a
[9381.43s -> 9388.58s]  little the afternoon is starting drawn the sudden sound of voices to your right startles you look
[9388.58s -> 9398.97s]  around oh dear you spin around to see seven hooded shapes squatting on the ground playing some sort
[9398.97s -> 9412.25s]  of weird game chanting in a curious tongue listen to the chant you listen closely to the voices
[9412.25s -> 9421.40s]  then stiffen as you realize one is calling you by your name we have awaited you you've made good
[9421.40s -> 9435.38s]  time to us we are the seven spirits come join us you raise your eyes to the heavens but there's
[9435.38s -> 9443.61s]  nothing here strange you've heard rumors of spots where no stars at all are in alignment but you've
[9443.61s -> 9450.74s]  never found one before the figures beckon you towards them into the very center of this magical
[9450.74s -> 9461.54s]  darkness there's no stars in the sky here i don't know they seem kind of friendly seem approachable
[9466.97s -> 9473.96s]  warily you approach who are these creatures how do they know your name will they offer advice or
[9473.96s -> 9480.97s]  are they dangerous as their skull mask faces suggest the spirits rise from the ground as
[9480.97s -> 9486.41s]  you approach gliding silently through the air passing through one another as they mingle and
[9486.41s -> 9495.85s]  encircle you linking hands that's not this is where you run caution is understandable but fear
[9495.85s -> 9509.27s]  us not what are you these bodies are not our natural bodies merely shells we cannot touch you
[9510.26s -> 9521.98s]  we cannot harm you how can you help me we can give you knowledge the chant we know will protect you
[9522.06s -> 9536.07s]  from all harm show me your true forms tell me the chant oh yes the spirits begin to turn and dance
[9536.07s -> 9542.74s]  around you chanting in a whispering unison but you cannot understand the words repeat kissing
[9542.74s -> 9548.82s]  with us repeating words in a language you cannot understand is difficult you try but stumble over
[9548.82s -> 9558.23s]  the first few lines a bill mandible as they chant you begin to feel stars appearing in the sky above
[9558.23s -> 9579.02s]  you magic i can see stars now protect from magic that one works there's also zap i don't think
[9579.02s -> 9594.46s]  that's gonna hurt anybody there's mud quicksand rap oh i can understand i can understand what
[9594.46s -> 9599.42s]  did that was like a super that was like a boston moment right there oh i can understand all
[9599.42s -> 9611.02s]  languages all right um well i can understand the spell now is what i'm saying that one's interesting
[9612.57s -> 9620.57s]  uh read minds is interesting let's get a couple of options for you guys to decide all right
[9620.57s -> 9630.23s]  rap which is talk all languages and understand all languages is mage which is protect from magic
[9630.23s -> 9643.58s]  mag and then there's also zap which is great lightning 60 second poll let's do what do you
[9643.58s -> 9656.89s]  want what do you feel like they feel like doing there's also some other stuff too there's i guess
[9656.89s -> 9665.62s]  tell is there but i think those are the most interesting yeah one is understanding one is
[9665.62s -> 9680.44s]  protection and what is just chaos so however you feel which one is reading minds tell although it
[9680.44s -> 9685.82s]  might not work because they might not be physically here the person has to be physically in your line
[9685.82s -> 9691.98s]  of sight for it to work and these are specters i don't know if that would work possible it might
[9692.62s -> 9703.88s]  all right what are we what are we thinking here is it rap it's overwhelming all right we're gonna do
[9705.21s -> 9718.44s]  talk all languages taking the wig from your pack you pull it onto your head and form your spell
[9718.44s -> 9721.88s]  suddenly the words of the chant resolve themselves into something you can understand
[9723.99s -> 9732.82s]  i call to be damned i offer a sign i call to be damned no idols are mine the words go round and
[9732.82s -> 9737.70s]  round over and over building in force with the wig on your head it is almost more than you can
[9737.70s -> 9750.17s]  bear to listen they're gonna slurp the ape they're gonna slurp oh no he said usurp the ape like slurp
[9750.17s -> 9756.20s]  them up they're gonna slurp up the ape i gotta run they actually are gonna replace my god with
[9756.20s -> 9769.42s]  something horrible i think they're gonna slurp the ape up they're going to usurp us us usurp how do
[9769.42s -> 9779.32s]  you say that word or how do you say this word or serp that sounds weird usurp usurp usurp i don't
[9779.32s -> 9786.70s]  the word doesn't sound right anymore usurp usurp that word does not sound real anymore right say
[9786.70s -> 9793.54s]  it a few times out loud in your room that word doesn't sound real anymore i i don't have an
[9793.54s -> 9801.13s]  offer i i'm gonna try to keep it on i need to run i need to get out of here should i keep listening
[9801.13s -> 9809.93s]  or take off the wig and get out i feel like if i keep listening then i'm probably gonna die
[9811.72s -> 9818.04s]  keep listening you keep listening the chant goes on and on the clouds begin to churn in the sky
[9818.04s -> 9822.76s]  then a loud crack breaks the stillness as a bolt of lightning skewers the place where the seven
[9822.76s -> 9830.55s]  spirits stand the light clears and they have vanished i'm running i'm running something is
[9830.55s -> 9836.55s]  very wrong you turn and start to run but you cannot get free something like a clawed hand has a hold
[9836.55s -> 9842.87s]  of you and is pulling you towards the top of a low mound the ground itself is transforming into a face
[9842.87s -> 9851.08s]  and you are walking into an open wide smile you struggle and strain but there is nothing to fight
[9851.08s -> 9858.62s]  with the wind your heels score tracks in the dust the force on you is like a hundred invisible hands
[9858.62s -> 9863.82s]  then you are above the wide open jaws of a face in the ground this must be holy ground to some
[9863.82s -> 9869.85s]  dread spirit long forgotten by the civilized people of the world but you will not learn its
[9870.73s -> 9880.33s]  you are not to be a follower you are to be devoured strike back strike back you raise the
[9880.33s -> 9885.77s]  sword to swing but stumble back onto the weight of it your arms seem unable to lift the blade
[9885.77s -> 9893.03s]  i'm so weak but no looking down you see your legs are suddenly thin and your hands are thin and bony
[9893.67s -> 9898.55s]  reaching up to your face you find your hairs coming away in clumps and wrinkles are spreading
[9898.55s -> 9908.38s]  over your skin the serpent face in the ground laughs the jaws of time are inescapable
[9912.66s -> 9919.26s]  you look to the heavens intending to cast a spell you cannot see the stars anymore your eyes
[9919.26s -> 9924.33s]  have grown blurry and unfocused and the night swims as if you were underwater
[9924.97s -> 9932.57s]  tumble to the ground and you hear the snap as the bones in your hip and pelvis give out
[9932.57s -> 9940.54s]  the serpent shifts closer you open your mouth to cry out and your teeth scattered
[9941.50s -> 9956.86s]  a moment later you are a skeleton you stare out through bone dead eyes cold dry bones you are
[9956.86s -> 9963.24s]  nothing but cold bones but then the winds drop once more the clouds roll back the steps are clearing
[9963.24s -> 9968.76s]  you've failures of becoming young once more bones strengthening skin tightening whatever was pulling
[9968.76s -> 9975.16s]  you towards death has released its grip you turn to see a gigantic shape lift into the ground and
[9975.16s -> 9981.02s]  swoop away northeast it leaves a strange trail as it flies and the wind from its movement knocks
[9981.02s -> 9993.24s]  you to the ground you stagger backwards glad to be alive and keen to leave this accursed place
[9999.83s -> 10013.75s]  made like ripples in time interesting well that's the time serpent and this is where the time serpent
[10013.75s -> 10028.23s]  is now that was the time serpent just fucking with us i do want to see what this is
[10030.20s -> 10039.70s]  before i aim the uh beam at it you set off across the steps with an easy stride but the firm dusty
[10039.70s -> 10044.90s]  ground becomes spongy and after a while you're no longer walking on firm ground but rather
[10044.90s -> 10050.02s]  striding between waist-high weeds in a deep and stench-filled marsh the evening is drawing in
[10050.02s -> 10055.29s]  soon it will be dark suddenly you hear a loud shouting and splashing from the ground of reeds
[10055.29s -> 10065.58s]  close at hand am i wrong you stand your ground as the voices approach you soon recognize them
[10065.58s -> 10075.53s]  as marsh goblins they enter the clearing panting hard as though running from something greet them
[10076.09s -> 10090.95s]  i mean if there's they're running from something i think i could hold on try bring a goblin out
[10090.95s -> 10098.44s]  and be like look i got a goblin where we're got i got a goblin will they be annoyed by that or
[10098.52s -> 10112.33s]  would they be i wonder talk all languages is interesting i could talk to them uh cause
[10112.33s -> 10131.54s]  sleepiness can't do smell uh i could do i'm gonna let's talk i'm gonna talk i'm gonna talk okay
[10132.10s -> 10137.03s]  removing the green wig you put it on and complete the spell the goblins guttural tongue begins to
[10137.03s -> 10146.73s]  transform into words what is this creature first goblin says we gotta go right out of the gate here
[10146.73s -> 10152.47s]  i mean you no harm you reply the goblins almost jump out of their skins as they realize
[10153.03s -> 10158.97s]  you can not only understand them now but also communicate we don't have time for this
[10158.97s -> 10167.77s]  we must escape what are you running from we're being chased by a terrible serpent it does not
[10167.77s -> 10172.89s]  seem to matter how fast we run however it is always ahead of us it's like it knows what we're
[10172.89s -> 10182.94s]  doing at each turn why is it chasing you it's been coming for us since we encountered the sorceress
[10183.02s -> 10192.10s]  bria she told us this parchment would save us but we're we've been persecuted the serpent is
[10192.10s -> 10198.63s]  clearly scared of it whatever it is i don't know what it is give me that parchment what serpent is
[10198.63s -> 10209.43s]  this which one like this is bad enough one's bad enough it seems to know every moment before we
[10209.43s -> 10217.66s]  know it ourselves give me that parchment he will save you from the serpent to be rid of it goblins
[10217.66s -> 10227.32s]  look from one to another uncertainly this parchment is our only hope i am a sorcerer i will read it to
[10227.32s -> 10235.88s]  you for you it is of no use to you hand it over or i will run you through i'm a sorcerer i will
[10235.88s -> 10245.85s]  read it for you the sorcerer it is worth trying they hand over the parchment and step back as
[10245.85s -> 10255.43s]  though expecting the ground to open underneath you of course nothing happens read it you unroll the
[10255.43s -> 10260.15s]  paper and look it over unfortunately it is written in a language you cannot understand despite your
[10260.15s -> 10276.25s]  spell licks thank them you thank them and they shrug it will do you little good stranger you
[10276.25s -> 10284.10s]  nod to the goblins thankful for their help we must hurry we must go they select a path through the
[10284.10s -> 10291.45s]  marsh and begin to move attack them let them go we need friends you stand aside and the goblins
[10291.45s -> 10297.46s]  hurry away through the marsh they move with the speed of rats still peering into the distant fog
[10297.46s -> 10308.63s]  you cannot see what it is they are afraid of links l i x all right let's go over to the room
[10308.63s -> 10320.46s]  the marshes give way to more solid barren ground the sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky
[10321.59s -> 10326.23s]  something is visible in the distance to the south perhaps man-made or perhaps a freak of nature
[10326.23s -> 10337.50s]  carved from the rocks but it resembles a low stone building interesting the temple behind the temple
[10338.14s -> 10354.44s]  all right okay uh some very clear directions to go to this looks interesting this is interesting
[10354.44s -> 10375.29s]  this is interesting i'm gonna just say let's go uh maybe the well first start at the well you skirt
[10375.29s -> 10379.13s]  around the building and the bits of rubble that surround it around the side of the ruin you find
[10379.13s -> 10386.84s]  an old well house the well is an ancient mud brick structure if it once had a cover it has long since
[10386.84s -> 10392.44s]  rotted but the metal winch handle is still in place and an old bucket on a rope hangs from it
[10393.64s -> 10400.10s]  drop the sun serpent orb into the well i kind of want to see what happens when i do this i'll
[10400.10s -> 10407.75s]  rewind drop the sun serpent orb into the well you lean over the well and then drop the orb containing
[10407.75s -> 10413.67s]  the sun serpent deep into its depths for a moment your heart swells with excitement but then as the
[10413.67s -> 10418.46s]  dust clears you realize you have not destroyed the serpent you have only set it free it boils
[10418.46s -> 10425.80s]  upwards like a rising fireball radiating a terrifying heat the serpent is a blaze of
[10425.80s -> 10439.10s]  yellow fire almost too bright to look at directly cast a spell i don't have anything that connects g
[10441.90s -> 10456.94s]  damn it i need that fucking ring okay shield no no i no no no no we're going to rewind
[10456.94s -> 10469.91s]  uh i'm gonna look in the bucket you haul the bucket over the side of the well and look into it
[10469.91s -> 10477.37s]  it is quite empty clearly this well has not been used for a very long time let's lower it
[10477.37s -> 10481.67s]  with some effort you get the handle of the well to turn and lower the bucket down into the well
[10481.67s -> 10488.87s]  shaft keep going you lower the bucket all the way to the end of the rope there is no splash from
[10488.87s -> 10498.65s]  below it seems the well is dry after all okay raise the bucket you turn the old creaking
[10498.65s -> 10505.90s]  handle raising the bucket up the shaft anything in it you look into the bucket a snake leaps out
[10505.90s -> 10510.57s]  at you from inside and you spring back just in time to avoid being bitten the bucket falls to
[10510.57s -> 10515.86s]  the ground and the snake slithers out towards you fangs bared is this one of the dreaded seven
[10515.86s -> 10540.41s]  serpents it seems very small this is bait it's not a serpent talk all languages again um illusion
[10540.41s -> 10558.54s]  would work fix requires a staff of oak sapling wait was it licks or fix you know you know i'm
[10558.54s -> 10569.30s]  asking it was licks um let's do something fun let's make an illusion we have the bracelet might
[10569.30s -> 10578.57s]  as well use it you bind the constellations into design around you the spell has no effect it seems
[10578.57s -> 10582.65s]  the snake is not intelligent enough to be fooled by an illusion okay well this is pretty evenly
[10582.65s -> 10593.06s]  matched we're going all in 50 hp done already the yellow snake looms up from the bucket spitting
[10593.14s -> 10599.46s]  you lash wildly aiming to chop the creature down as it also leaps forward thick snake blood
[10599.46s -> 10607.16s]  pours along your sword blade i think i can go again because that was all i'm going again
[10607.16s -> 10612.87s]  and it was huge and it was almost a two-hit kill snake is weakening its snarls across the
[10612.87s -> 10617.03s]  ground i think i go again there's no way you're gonna be able to do it by it better than that
[10617.03s -> 10624.02s]  and you're dead perfect sword play flawless fighting you slice a side blow the snake hisses
[10624.02s -> 10635.29s]  as it dies all right you return to the side of the well we're good what else can i do here maybe
[10635.29s -> 10655.74s]  should i float down force field float in the air let's do float in the air see if i can go in there
[10656.38s -> 10671.38s]  oh that lower the bucket oh fuck okay climb climb i'm gonna go climb into the well you feel inside
[10671.38s -> 10675.88s]  the edge of the well for handholds it has been at least a day since you last wandered through a
[10675.88s -> 10682.52s]  sewer after all but there are none the stone edges of the wall are smooth and the well itself is too
[10682.52s -> 10688.02s]  broad to shimmy down you could always climb down the rope of course yeah i'll be good i'm
[10688.02s -> 10692.57s]  floating i'm literally floating right now you steal your courage and swing your legs over the
[10692.57s -> 10698.36s]  edge of the well regarding the darkness far below the rope is old and probably rotten and should it
[10698.36s -> 10706.44s]  break there will be no way back up i'm done hand over hand you lower yourself into the ancient
[10706.44s -> 10717.00s]  well shaft okay with your reduced weight you scramble down the rope without difficulty until
[10717.00s -> 10723.54s]  you are until you are hanging just beside a crystal seam in the rock look at the crystal
[10723.54s -> 10732.41s]  dig out the crystal with my sword use the aniland sword instead okay what is this the seam of
[10732.41s -> 10737.21s]  crystal is quite beautiful the soft rock walls are studded with fists and lumps of green and
[10737.21s -> 10745.78s]  blue gem glass there must be a fortune down here perhaps even a layered strata of pure wealth
[10745.78s -> 10756.33s]  only the backlands could be mined by the king of aniland uh let's use the shitty sword using
[10756.33s -> 10761.21s]  your old sword awkwardly in the narrow confines of the well shaft you dig a fistful of gems out
[10761.21s -> 10767.59s]  of the wall of the well shaft you cannot catch them all and they fall but thankfully land in the
[10767.59s -> 10773.46s]  bucket a short distance below you oh i didn't lower it all the way the bucket was lowered
[10773.46s -> 10779.14s]  halfway right next to me you have blunted the edge of your blade in the process however
[10779.14s -> 10786.94s]  should i dig for more more you keep digging hoping to get even more crystal from the rock wall
[10786.94s -> 10793.46s]  and you do getting several crystals the size of skulls but then your spell wears off the rope
[10794.18s -> 10799.30s]  and then starts to spin violently it is unraveling there's nothing you can do to stop it
[10799.30s -> 10805.56s]  then it snaps and you fall hitting the bucket below saved for a moment you think you are saved
[10805.56s -> 10810.86s]  but of course nothing is holding up the bucket you fall into the depths of the well when the bucket
[10810.86s -> 10824.30s]  shatters your neck goes with it you fall into your death your adventure is at an end okay well i got
[10824.38s -> 10838.98s]  greedy okay uh thankfully land the bucket dig for more wait shit i did the thing as it says
[10838.98s -> 10849.35s]  it says it's the same thing okay use the sword okay go back up i'm all right all right all right
[10849.35s -> 10856.04s]  i just i didn't know if i could do anything else okay go back up not wanting to risk the spell
[10856.04s -> 10864.73s]  wearing off you clamor up quickly okay now i'm gonna get the gems raise the bucket you bring
[10864.73s -> 10869.59s]  the bucket up to the well look in the bucket you check inside the bucket the bottom of the bucket
[10869.59s -> 10875.67s]  is also filled with uncut gemstones and glittering rock this hall must be worth scores of gold
[10875.67s -> 10882.92s]  pieces take the gems scoop up the gems from the pocket you scoop up the gems from the pocket and
[10882.92s -> 10890.30s]  pour them gleefully into your money pouch an excellent find the gems are an assortment of
[10890.30s -> 10896.82s]  different types of stone and will require an expert to sort value and cut them but the sheer
[10896.82s -> 10910.39s]  size of them is jaw dropping several are the size of eggs and one is the size of a small cat who can
[10910.39s -> 10921.53s]  i bring these to the jeweler from the village is the jeweler from the village ah maybe i can go back
[10921.53s -> 10929.51s]  okay leave the well please with your work you stride away from the well i need to eat
[10929.51s -> 10956.31s]  because i'm dying and i let's see good uh let's go in here oh i love this art style what's the
[10956.31s -> 10972.15s]  artist's name i what's the artist's name look it up sorcery artist i should know this why
[10972.15s -> 10992.18s]  don't have how have i forgotten this ian livingston that's where it is ian livingston is the artist
[10992.18s -> 11010.22s]  i love it you climb up onto the plinth on which the structure stands it appears quiet enough
[11010.22s -> 11020.92s]  so whether it is structurally sound or not is another matter cool one of the pillars of the
[11020.92s -> 11033.16s]  temple seems to take a step sideways or was that your imagination you step inside the temple the
[11033.16s -> 11038.44s]  floor space is quite empty but the walls are decorated with long lines of strange hieroglyphs
[11038.95s -> 11045.51s]  that remind you a little of the symbols decorated the ancient shrine of corga in kare you cannot
[11045.51s -> 11051.54s]  read them but may be able to decipher them if you look more closely a little dust trickles down from
[11051.54s -> 11061.82s]  the temple roof okay so this is a corga shrine corga if you recap andy here corga is a god in
[11061.82s -> 11075.50s]  this game a god and if you it's very god's very easy to anger it's the god of what is it chaos
[11075.50s -> 11081.91s]  or something you have to do a very specific step of instructions for it to get the favor of corga
[11081.91s -> 11093.90s]  or it'll kill you instantly um let's let's just read the hieroglyphs are not exactly like any
[11093.90s -> 11098.38s]  language you have seen before but they are similar to others you know you spell out the first few
[11098.38s -> 11111.46s]  words allowed this temple built by priests yadu in honor in honor throth goddess of earth wrong
[11111.46s -> 11119.43s]  lore fake fan oops those not of faith are forbidden and these must not speak the name
[11119.43s -> 11125.16s]  throth you stop suddenly there's a deep rumbling in the ground below your feet
[11127.59s -> 11135.69s]  don't say the name throth while you're reading the name throth uh i forget what happens here
[11141.82s -> 11146.87s]  if i don't have throth for a god i can't be here i think i just need to get out of here
[11146.87s -> 11160.10s]  ian livingston is a different author john blanche the artist really i always thought that ian
[11160.10s -> 11171.67s]  livingston did the art let me hold on let me let's confirm this ian livingston is an english

[11495.13s -> 11500.17s]  opening a crack in the ground beneath your feet from above the roof cracks and a slab of rock
[11500.17s -> 11508.25s]  falls do not alter my beliefs your heart is resolute and you are fixed the rock overhead
[11508.25s -> 11516.84s]  falls it is your capstone and the ground below is your grave you have been buried alive okay so
[11516.84s -> 11527.22s]  we just don't step over here all right i'm gonna push one of the pillars testing the strength you
[11527.22s -> 11533.06s]  have you heave against one of the temple's pillars it seems solid then a moment later it shears and
[11533.06s -> 11541.19s]  gives way the whole structure is sliding down on top of you dodge you dodge backwards as the gigantic
[11541.19s -> 11546.23s]  roof of the building tilts sliding in your direction you are still alive but you're now
[11546.23s -> 11555.50s]  trapping ease an enormous pile of rubble help help me help you cry out feebly for aid but of
[11555.50s -> 11568.52s]  course no one comes these are the clatterback steps and no one lives here broth traders deserve
[11568.52s -> 11578.01s]  the kid oh my god uh i could summon a giant please giant friend help me i'm buried under all of this
[11578.97s -> 11599.99s]  i can't teleport i could grow in size that one works i'm dead in one hit you cast the enchantment
[11599.99s -> 11606.63s]  rapidly growing to 18 feet in height but in such a small space there is no room for the transition
[11606.63s -> 11616.57s]  and you end up terribly squashed i just made it worse all right push the stones i'm big now
[11616.57s -> 11621.30s]  you even push with all you might and finally a few of the stones begin to move you keep pushing
[11621.30s -> 11624.90s]  yourself through until you squirm out from underneath the giant pillar and lie gasping
[11624.90s -> 11632.04s]  on the stone the temple is now completely destroyed thus spiraling up into the air
[11632.04s -> 11637.75s]  you search through the rubble but find nothing of use the plinth is now knee deep in broken
[11637.75s -> 11646.82s]  stone and pebble sized rocks take a pebble okay i now have access to grenades you gather up a
[11646.82s -> 11653.02s]  couple of pebbles from the plinth of the right size and shape to be useful in spells but of the
[11653.02s -> 11663.22s]  ancient temples treasures and artifacts there's nothing more to be had oh did i lose access to
[11663.22s -> 11670.89s]  this i think i did i destroyed the whole place there's nothing more to be done here you leave
[11670.89s -> 11689.18s]  the ancient building behind and you stride forwards okay okay we're cool what about okay
[11689.18s -> 11693.34s]  so now i'm going to go over here and let's aim this in this direction and see what this looks
[11693.34s -> 11706.74s]  like in the in the past then we can aim it up here too got a lot to do okay you sink lower
[11706.74s -> 11712.25s]  in the mud we already did this you go through the marsh uh just keep walking we're fine we won't
[11712.25s -> 11722.39s]  sink it's just the marsh lands and now let's go into the mountain last hit point dude uh it's true
[11723.96s -> 12018.17s]  i gotta pee let's take a break i'll be right back seeing some people saying woman throff
[12018.17s -> 12049.29s]  hell seems like it's a little bit of a war here we got the age still we're fine back to it all
[12049.29s -> 12060.76s]  right so we are at another tower you want a quick little recap we ruined this temple pissed off an
[12060.76s -> 12072.68s]  incredibly powerful goddess chose the ape uh got like tortured over here by the time serpent time
[12072.68s -> 12081.18s]  serpent kind of fucked off over here i said it looks like at least it looks like that and now
[12081.18s -> 12088.94s]  we're here at one of these beacons you approach the edge of the mountains in the base of an old
[12088.94s -> 12093.98s]  stone tower carved from the cliff face itself from the battlements of the tower protrudes a strange
[12093.98s -> 12115.18s]  brass cylinder nestled between the stones there's a large closed wooden door okay let's just knock
[12115.18s -> 12122.20s]  on the door you knock on the door there's no reply i only have one hp so i can't really cast any
[12122.20s -> 12128.47s]  spells so we're just gonna have to go in you try the door to the tower it's locked but the wood is
[12128.47s -> 12136.44s]  ancient and rotten and could most likely be easily broken break down the door you take a run up and
[12136.44s -> 12142.17s]  then charge at the door smashing straight through and tumbling to the floor inside hopefully this
[12142.17s -> 12151.11s]  doesn't kill me oh no i'm dead i'm gonna die here okay you pick yourself up off the ground
[12151.11s -> 12156.39s]  only finding yourself staring into the snarling jaws of a wolfhound it's clearly half mad with
[12156.39s -> 12171.93s]  starvation there's no time and no choice let's go six good okay that was clean it limps back
[12172.01s -> 12180.31s]  bleeding heavily if i get it close again here like three point let's do all in i just completely
[12180.31s -> 12199.51s]  ruined everything i'm dead i thought it was good okay uh this time it's gonna defend i'm gonna
[12199.51s -> 12210.15s]  defend too and then we full blast uh yep all right we're good full blast again that should do it
[12212.09s -> 12217.93s]  barely but we got it all right i'm good wolfhounds howls a gurgling blood-soaked
[12217.93s -> 12224.89s]  sound that rings inside the tower and then it dies you wipe your long sword and how much
[12224.89s -> 12229.83s]  harder would this be without the long sword i wonder plus two you wipe your long sword and gas
[12229.83s -> 12235.35s]  for breath as you look around the room the wide tower base is empty except for a flight of spiral
[12235.35s -> 12243.67s]  stairs leading up to a hatch in the ceiling overhead search the shadows you try to ignore
[12243.67s -> 12248.23s]  the smell of wet blood that fills the chamber and search the gloomy arches under the spiraling
[12248.23s -> 12257.19s]  staircase in a forgotten corner you unearth three gold pieces take the money you take the coins and
[12257.19s -> 12261.11s]  drop them into your purse time to leave this gloomy place yes we're going to go turn this on
[12266.47s -> 12271.94s]  i should sleep here you clamor up the spiral stairs to the hatch and go through onto the roof
[12271.94s -> 12277.56s]  of the tower the cool wind of the steps hits you full in the face snatching your breath away
[12277.56s -> 12282.86s]  this tower stands on the slope of one of the horns themselves looking out over the hole of
[12282.86s -> 12288.60s]  the steps the tower bears another brass cylinder similar to the last there are powerful unusual
[12288.60s -> 12313.06s]  stars here unusual stars why are they unusual unusual i could see the future again here
[12316.07s -> 12330.31s]  hmm activate the beacon takes a moment beacon is now activated and ah okay look what i could do
[12330.87s -> 12343.06s]  here's okay here's here's the i could aim it here or actually right here i could complete the bridge
[12343.06s -> 12357.99s]  with this one and turn that beacon into the past is there anything here worth exploring probably
[12357.99s -> 12367.77s]  that so remember this is the past so this was the temple now it's something else now it's just
[12367.77s -> 12385.83s]  the one little spot this is still here let's check out this because i want to see what this is
[12385.83s -> 12392.38s]  i want to see this in the past and i want to see over here in the past too that should do it right
[12393.02s -> 12407.45s]  it's also rest go get the ring i'll go get the ring you could not choose a better place to rest
[12407.45s -> 12412.81s]  you close the latch and lie down on top of it nothing will cost you now unless it has wings
[12413.53s -> 12418.47s]  at least you've eaten once already today thank god you close your eyes and let your
[12418.47s -> 12425.99s]  tiredness overtake you you feel quite safe you do not dream you ran out of provisions and gained
[12425.99s -> 12431.27s]  some gold and you collected the sun serpent so you now have destroyed three of the archmages
[12431.27s -> 12443.50s]  serpents okay look at the view you go over to the battleman and lean out looking north you see the
[12443.50s -> 12449.80s]  edge of the thick and virgin forest the fabled trees of santa you heard about them as a boy of
[12449.80s -> 12455.58s]  course but never dreamed you would see them for yourself between there and here is nothing but
[12455.58s -> 12460.55s]  the level flats of the steps layered like the scales on a serpent's back a thin column of
[12460.55s -> 12465.58s]  smoke rises from a point just before the treeline it must be the village of the clatterman
[12465.58s -> 12483.03s]  you look away from the view once more let's get down here okay good good mountains easter
[12483.03s -> 12491.37s]  impassable huh all right so let's see what this is now i feel like i'm gonna get fucked with by the
[12491.93s -> 12497.34s]  time serpent again but this is in the past you're walking through boggy marshland a few clouds
[12497.34s -> 12503.72s]  hurry across the sky you cross the marshland and pause inside a ring of seven standing stones
[12503.72s -> 12510.86s]  look at the stones each stone in the ring is the size and breadth of a man they stand straight
[12510.86s -> 12518.42s]  upright except for one which has listed sideways like an arthritic finger a few are carved in the
[12518.42s -> 12523.99s]  very center of the ring a flat stone lies an inch or so below the water level of the marsh wet
[12523.99s -> 12531.05s]  things gulp and groan in the mud below one time i listened to one of your streams so i could go
[12531.05s -> 12540.15s]  to sleep and it gave me the worst nightmares it's not my fault that's the entire like four or five
[12540.15s -> 12546.01s]  servings of macaroni and cheese you ate before going to bed has nothing to do with me that's
[12546.01s -> 12560.42s]  nothing to do with me come on gwen okay uh should i go stand on it look at it you trace the carving
[12560.42s -> 12566.74s]  on one of the nearby stones shows a fearsome bird rising up into the sky wings blotting out
[12566.74s -> 12571.77s]  the rising sun let's just go stand on it fuck it why not you go stand on the central stone but
[12571.77s -> 12577.16s]  nothing special occurs if there is magic here you cannot fathom it you step out from the circle
[12577.16s -> 12585.32s]  once more and plod on through the marsh water so i don't get it maybe this is where you cast licks
[12585.32s -> 12594.97s]  it's been a long time i don't remember i besides last year when i played it yeah you gotta go back
[12594.97s -> 12614.55s]  seven or eight years okay let's go i want to see this too and this laughing my ass off what is
[12614.55s -> 12622.02s]  this youtube donation shit i don't know i i didn't even look at it yet i have not even opened up my
[12622.02s -> 12628.07s]  twitch dashboard to even see what that is like i know what it is but i haven't even looked at it
[12628.07s -> 12633.21s]  all right the ground itself seems to give way to bog land until you are splashing through marshland
[12633.21s -> 12639.08s]  once again you stumble upon a low round structure it is the mouth of a well oh it's the well the
[12639.08s -> 12657.35s]  well is the only thing that's here is there more gems in here i'm going in should i throw a stone
[12657.35s -> 12663.78s]  toss a stone you toss a stone into the well it falls for a few seconds and then you hear a splash
[12663.78s -> 12669.85s]  so there's water in the past as you stand by the well side you hear a scraping noise from within
[12669.93s -> 12674.33s]  and after a few minutes two curved claws emerge through the opening hooking onto either side of
[12674.33s -> 12682.15s]  the well mouth something is pulling itself up dislodge the hooks acting quickly you knock the
[12682.15s -> 12689.83s]  hooks free there is a scream very human as the figure inside the well falls there is a distant
[12689.83s -> 12697.50s]  splash and then silence oh shit are you in there you cry leaning over the edge of the well there
[12697.50s -> 12708.97s]  is no reply i think i just killed somebody look into the well you stare down hoping for a response
[12708.97s -> 12718.30s]  but can make nothing out below toss down the rope ladder acting quickly you tie the rope ladder to
[12718.30s -> 12724.23s]  a peg on the well house and toss the rope ladder down for a moment you think it has done no good
[12724.23s -> 12731.30s]  but then the rope goes taut someone is climbing up am i just running at this point like why would
[12731.30s -> 12743.10s]  you run wait you wait as the figure clamors out of the well and then dusts itself down
[12743.18s -> 12752.81s]  they collect up the rope ladder and hand it back to you thank you stranger the creature declares
[12752.81s -> 12760.30s]  greetings you declare the creature doffs its hat rubbing a bruise on its head as it hands you back
[12760.30s -> 12765.94s]  the stone you threw down the well then without a further word it turns and disappears across
[12765.94s -> 12787.26s]  what is there something else i could have said it's just okay you continue to walk a big bruise on
[12787.26s -> 12812.15s]  his head uh can i go up here uh the air is warm oh wait a minute i can what's this have i been i
[12812.15s -> 12819.00s]  don't i haven't been here you keep moving ascending and descending the sun is beginning to lower and
[12819.00s -> 12830.23s]  the air begins to cool this is the eastern slope of the baobab ridge move on oh it's too steep i
[12830.23s -> 12852.57s]  can't get up there it's too steep but i want to who's in this hut could i have floated or
[12857.82s -> 12867.32s]  i guess i can let's do uh this doesn't cost any stamina let's hover looking to the constellations
[12867.32s -> 12872.60s]  you craft the spell then the medallion begins to glow as you rise gently into the air you rise a
[12872.60s -> 12880.14s]  short way up the rock chimney but the whole ascent is a long way keep going spell carries you high
[12880.14s -> 12889.74s]  and without incident or weakening you land gently on the mountaintop here we go oh okay your weight
[12889.74s -> 12895.94s]  returns and you settle gradually back down to the ground this was once perhaps the cone of a volcano
[12896.81s -> 12903.06s]  now it is a wide dusty stone bowl but it is not empty in the center stands a circular dwelling
[12903.38s -> 12911.13s]  with a steeply pitched canvas roof look at the chimney looking more closely at the chimney in
[12911.13s -> 12914.89s]  the rock you notice a faint purple aura surrounding some of the stones near the top
[12915.45s -> 12921.80s]  and a few faint purple glows further down perhaps there is some enchantment on this
[12921.80s -> 12929.32s]  blue or perhaps it is simply a color the owner of the hut enjoys cold winds claw your skin it
[12929.32s -> 12936.65s]  might just they might just like the color you're going the wrong way there is no wrong way there
[12936.65s -> 12956.47s]  is only there's only forward in sorcery there's no wrong way drop a stone down the chimney what
[12956.47s -> 12968.18s]  can i do here i keep dropping rocks on people's heads uh i mean this is a great opportunity
[12968.98s -> 12981.29s]  to send a goblin in yeah let's do it i'm doing it okay casting your spell across the goblin
[12981.29s -> 12986.87s]  tooth the tooth erupts into a column of smoke and a moment later a goblin warrior is standing in
[12986.87s -> 12995.70s]  front of you order the goblin into the hut you point at the hut door and order the goblin to
[12995.70s -> 13004.28s]  proceed it does so but a moment later has vaporized into a pile of dust clearly something very powerful
[13004.28s -> 13013.99s]  lives within all right now drop a rock down the chimney you grab a nearby stone and toss it over
[13013.99s -> 13019.18s]  the side of the mountain it plummets just as fast as you might expect careening and bouncing from
[13019.18s -> 13026.14s]  the chimney sides until it explodes into particulate dust halfway down a few loose
[13026.14s -> 13039.58s]  stones tumble over the sheer drop to the east and disappear uh send another goblin in that
[13039.58s -> 13060.58s]  was funny i could do big safe passage how is a good one here do another goblin what about sus
[13061.38s -> 13072.49s]  i mean we we casted a free sus because i said to a goblin to go in there and investigate and he got
[13072.49s -> 13082.17s]  fucking liquidated so we know it's dangerous in there let's do big and just like walk over there
[13082.17s -> 13093.51s]  why not you line the starlight into shape quickly expanding to triple your size let's go into the
[13093.59s -> 13099.27s]  chimney i can't can i no no no no no no this is i'm gonna slide down
[13100.66s -> 13106.95s]  pass no we're going in the hut i'm going to the hut you approach the hut its walls are made of
[13106.95s -> 13112.76s]  painted wooden planks well set into the rock below this is no temporary shack or a traveler's tent
[13113.32s -> 13119.88s]  a little thin smoke is rising from the stack there's strong and generous magic here as often
[13119.88s -> 13128.68s]  occurs high up knock on the door you approach the door and you knock from inside of wizened voice
[13128.68s -> 13138.90s]  calls you're late enter the hut intrigued by the voice's words you open the door and hunch down
[13138.90s -> 13148.30s]  low and squeeze yourself into the oh i'm big what what's the point of being this huge okay
[13151.34s -> 13157.85s]  inside the hut there is no room to stand up it is a small place made even smaller by your spell
[13157.85s -> 13170.01s]  of giantism let us suppose that i am a sorcerer and you are a sorcerer too do you know which of
[13170.01s -> 13182.74s]  us is the more powerful uh there is no contest it is i guess so a moment later there is a snatch
[13182.74s -> 13190.33s]  of music and suddenly your legs and arms jerk upwards then fall still what was that there's
[13190.33s -> 13195.85s]  another burst of magic and your legs begin to kick and pirouette you around you are dancing
[13198.25s -> 13207.32s]  oh i'm getting i'm getting a jig uh stand still you try to hold your body still but it is useless
[13207.32s -> 13212.68s]  it is not that your limbs are under external control but rather the compulsion to dance like
[13212.68s -> 13219.30s]  the compulsion to sneeze is so strong you cannot resist for more than a moment i see you are not
[13219.30s -> 13226.46s]  powerful enough to counter that stop the music the music stops and you collapse into a nearby
[13226.46s -> 13235.78s]  chair i know the spell you hear the speaker rise and approach a wizened calloused hand is offered
[13236.71s -> 13244.78s]  welcome i mean you're no harm as you can tell by my advanced age spit on the hand
[13247.67s -> 13255.94s]  no greetings okay gentle light is filling the hut and you can now see the sorceress a woman so ancient
[13255.94s -> 13262.50s]  that her features are lost within a mess of wrinkles she smiles as you look at her i could
[13262.50s -> 13273.53s]  be anybody under all these years could i not who are you my name is bria i am a sorceress of high
[13273.53s -> 13281.62s]  zamen though i left that place some time ago you're welcome she frowns though if you continue
[13281.62s -> 13286.90s]  stomping around in here at three times your proper size you're going to knock something over so we
[13286.90s -> 13298.49s]  won't have any more of that it'll it'll pass hey it'll pass soon don't worry it'll pass
[13299.86s -> 13310.92s]  cancel the spell no i'm good i'm hanging out i'm big it'll pass soon you reply casually not soon
[13310.92s -> 13316.39s]  enough bria clicks her tongue and reaches into a pouch by her side producing something the size
[13316.39s -> 13325.56s]  and shape of a die what what is that you say as you lean forward bumping the part of your forehead
[13325.56s -> 13334.04s]  that hurts the most onto the beam that is a support beam of the roof ow the giant's tooth
[13334.60s -> 13340.78s]  she replies casting it onto the floor a moment later smoke is hissing from the tooth are we
[13340.78s -> 13353.29s]  having a giant fight uh step back you step back quickly expecting a giant to materialize in the
[13353.29s -> 13358.76s]  middle of the hut but nothing happens the smoke from the tooth quickly passes a moment later you
[13359.40s -> 13368.14s]  are shrinking back to your normal size a counter spell yes the spell of giantism is countered by
[13368.14s -> 13382.73s]  that of giant summoning cheeky very cheeky you are a follower of the archmage jumping back yes yes
[13382.73s -> 13389.45s]  yes you are worried but please the archmage of the fortress was not always as he is now gradually
[13389.45s -> 13397.66s]  you shrink back down to your normal size ask about the archmage can you tell me of the archmage
[13397.66s -> 13404.20s]  imagine if you will a country of great peace and prosperity ruled over by a group of wise and
[13404.20s -> 13410.62s]  powerful sorcerers and sorceresses they tended the fields managed the weather healed the sick
[13410.62s -> 13416.81s]  they chose their leader by an arcane process any child from the land might become that leader
[13416.81s -> 13426.92s]  and be taught their role from an early age what of the crown you demand the crown of kings a
[13426.92s -> 13432.44s]  powerful thing certainly but nothing against a fortress of sorcerers working in concert the
[13432.44s -> 13441.02s]  crown was given to the human kingdoms to let them feel themselves self-governed imagine the archmage
[13441.02s -> 13448.63s]  as a peacemaker teacher but also a thinker a discoverer of many secrets of the stars he looked
[13448.63s -> 13465.40s]  too far this archmage he is evil yes now yes that is probably true it was not always so but you
[13465.40s -> 13473.18s]  should not let that trouble you if you need to kill him and kill him you must she gestures you
[13473.18s -> 13481.34s]  to sit down and takes a seat herself what about the serpents what do you know of the seven serpents
[13481.34s -> 13487.37s]  they are the archmage's servants but even they cannot travel the backlands without
[13487.37s -> 13496.50s]  fouling foul of its terrible curse i see that you search for them do you know where they are
[13496.50s -> 13503.96s]  i've seen a few things the earth serpent lies in wait in a fissure near the great lake eclala
[13503.96s -> 13510.50s]  and the serpent of time is the worst of the seven swift and all but indestructible
[13513.21s -> 13522.52s]  fissure near the great lake does he have a weakness he does i do not know it it is a secret known
[13522.52s -> 13531.56s]  only to the marsh goblins if you can find them i did find them you thank her the old woman stands
[13531.56s -> 13540.71s]  suddenly and goes over to a table tea yeah thank you i'll stay i i licks how do she nods and boils
[13540.71s -> 13547.10s]  a pan of water by holding it between her palms for a moment she drops a pat of goat butter and
[13547.10s -> 13557.86s]  stirs it around and pours out two ceramic cups i did this routine last time but we're doing it
[13557.86s -> 13563.46s]  again you see i swapped the cups when you turned around and then i thought you poisoned your cup
[13563.46s -> 13571.80s]  but then the fact that i swapped the cups means the poison was in my cup thank you i will bow for
[13571.80s -> 13585.38s]  that one inconceivable i love when he just falls over he just goes he's like completely still and
[13585.38s -> 13591.35s]  he just goes just drink it normally i'll just we'll just drink it i'm gonna drink mine you
[13591.35s -> 13596.98s]  lift the cup to your lips and drink deep it is warm and rich and refreshing didn't need to swap
[13596.98s -> 13608.70s]  cups don't need to do anything weird i don't i don't think that rea is gonna hurt us goat cheese
[13608.70s -> 13615.59s]  tea i know i wouldn't drink it this is the anilander not me my suspension of disbelief is
[13615.59s -> 13620.47s]  only go so far i mean i it's actually kind of hard to believe that somebody would drink
[13620.47s -> 13627.10s]  goat cheese tea it's that my disbelief is hard to to quell when i think about anybody eating anything
[13627.10s -> 13635.78s]  goat cheese i just you're losing me a little tell me more of yourself you ask sipping your tea
[13638.84s -> 13646.25s]  me blushing a lot there was little more to know i lived in the fortress for most of my life
[13646.25s -> 13655.16s]  i came here in my old age she winces hot tea is dripping from a crack in her tea cup cheap
[13655.16s -> 13661.18s]  pottery rubbish she grumbles digging up a small pot of glue from a box and repairing it she leaves
[13661.18s -> 13669.56s]  the glue pot on the table do you play swindle stones i mean can i have the i need glue for a
[13669.56s -> 13674.97s]  spell you pick up the pot of glue and put it in your pack without another word the sorceress
[13674.97s -> 13682.98s]  watches you with some amusement though you cannot think why she stands i'm tiring of you you should
[13682.98s -> 13692.84s]  go but first one more thing if you are traveling to high xamen to face the archmage hadn't you best
[13692.84s -> 13703.48s]  know a little of the higher functions of magic you speak of countering good you know it
[13706.68s -> 13712.09s]  it can take a lifetime to discover the pairings and to master them but i can show you something
[13712.09s -> 13718.50s]  simple she raises a finger adorned with a wide collection of rings one made of green metal begins
[13718.50s -> 13727.62s]  to pulse but she does not fire right away she's giving you a moment to react run for the door i
[13727.62s -> 13740.06s]  gotta get out of here oh shit what do i do counterspell my spell of teleportation i have
[13740.06s -> 13760.81s]  already given you the clue as to what spell you need it's glue it's glue great glue that she did
[13760.81s -> 13769.19s]  it on purpose you weave the spell and toss the glue over your own feet you feel it binding your
[13769.19s -> 13775.02s]  boots to the floor the sorceress smiles as she completes her spell firing at you with her green
[13775.10s -> 13786.82s]  ringed finger you stare her magic in the face but nothing happens very good every magic has
[13786.82s -> 13794.07s]  a counter magic the enchantment of gluing matches the spell of teleportation your own spell has
[13794.07s -> 13801.29s]  evaporated as well your boots move freely once more prepare yourself she shows you an open palm
[13801.29s -> 13809.14s]  filled with rock dust hey can you stop afraid of them afraid of the ape save me ape that's my
[13809.14s -> 13826.17s]  counterspell faith that's my counterspell faith to the ape and it always works okay sand that's
[13827.69s -> 13848.97s]  quicksand that would be uh gale horn zen i don't zen's not available it's probably gale horn
[13852.17s -> 13869.40s]  oh wait hold on it could be wall so this is quicksand so floating would probably work
[13871.32s -> 13879.29s]  i think that's it yeah okay feeling your body weight shifting to a mere fraction of normal
[13880.25s -> 13885.37s]  just as bria's spell of petrification begins to take hold the two forces one turning you to
[13885.37s -> 13892.25s]  air the other to stone fight within you but with decreasing force moment by moment eventually your
[13892.25s -> 13900.09s]  body returns to normal yes indeed the magic of lightness is blocked by that of petrification
[13900.09s -> 13905.59s]  you've learned enough you must leave but not without a gift she slides the ring of green
[13905.59s -> 13916.97s]  metal from her finger and holds it out to you teleport ring take it you take the ring swiftly
[13916.97s -> 13923.48s]  and slide it onto your finger you feel a pulse through your veins i wish you well now be gone
[13923.48s -> 13939.56s]  okay now we know where two of them are oh i think okay it's in the it's in the present
[13942.17s -> 13950.07s]  yeah because this is uh i have this going to the past where even are we oh we all the way over here
[13950.07s -> 13966.90s]  geez return to the hut should i go back in no no no oh she'll probably kill me um what what's
[13966.90s -> 13978.28s]  over here let's just look it's a big circle you head over to the mountain pass look around you
[13978.28s -> 13983.24s]  glance around the wide pit of the old volcano but there's little to be seen no doubt the ash
[13983.24s -> 13988.34s]  mixed in the dust is what makes the forest you saw on the slopes so lush and verdant at least
[13988.34s -> 14000.44s]  it seems fairly unlikely the volcano will erupt again so this will take down through here where
[14000.44s -> 14018.76s]  this is where we started by the way it's here uh we need to go back in this way okay make a move
[14019.74s -> 14028.39s]  into the chimney okay you begin to plunge down the mountainside knocking and scraping the rock
[14028.39s -> 14032.23s]  surface on either side you close your eyes and your heart begins to move up your throat wait i
[14032.23s -> 14040.94s]  just jump off the cliff oh i just jumped off you followed speed a dead drop down the side of the
[14040.94s -> 14046.23s]  mountain the rushing wind snatches away your breath death is certain you take a moment to
[14046.23s -> 14062.97s]  arrange your thoughts do i die you're almost at the bottom the sharp rocks rush to meet you
[14064.17s -> 14068.41s]  then a few heartbeats from a terrible death your fall is suddenly cushioned
[14068.41s -> 14077.29s]  and you are brought to a gentle stop at the base of the mountain i landed you stand hearts still
[14077.29s -> 14082.95s]  racing at the bottom of the stone chimney quite amazed to be alive but there's no way back up that
[14082.95s -> 14102.60s]  you can see what plot armor i think it was her i'm going to assume it was her okay let's go back here
[14102.60s -> 14121.34s]  because i want to point this over here see what this was like in the uh in the past keep going
[14121.34s -> 14147.14s]  mm-hmm i'm also going to try to hit the bridge too with this i can sleep up here too which is
[14147.14s -> 14160.39s]  perfect i don't have any food but it's all right ah see the hut up here i wonder if it's worth
[14160.39s -> 14177.82s]  going back there back in the past there's a lot going on in the swamp i think there's probably a
[14177.82s -> 14186.34s]  serpent in the swamp before it became the forest but that's not what i'm going to do my goal is
[14186.34s -> 14197.14s]  to go like this try to hit this part of the bridge so it's complete so i can go across it
[14197.14s -> 14212.39s]  and at the same time hitting this needs to be complete because then i'll aim this one over here
[14215.37s -> 14229.02s]  na aim i'm good is that enough i think that's enough because then i can just connect these two
[14229.02s -> 14235.22s]  let's go for it and i'm going to teleport over here let's go sauron chop chop we got more reading
[14235.22s -> 14253.40s]  to fucking do i'm going i'm going um i need to sleep let me sleep first let's go sauron you've
[14253.40s -> 14263.86s]  not eaten your pack is empty that's all right it keeps reminding me of this even though i did
[14263.86s -> 14283.22s]  that like four days ago okay now i'm going to go get the ring what's the spell to uneat the
[14283.22s -> 14295.19s]  pack of ritz crackers i just inhaled um we'll just wait like 16 hours or so and then when
[14295.19s -> 14310.42s]  you're sitting on the toilet pretend to be casting a spell when you know that makes sense come on
[14310.50s -> 14325.91s]  dude what no they want to eat them again oh but i mean like minus two respectfully
[14326.78s -> 14332.22s]  grow up that's not what i'm saying that i meant like oh that's like a funny oh how do i like get
[14332.22s -> 14341.54s]  rid of the ritz crackers i just ate i don't know i thought like oh yeah to the stars those ritz
[14341.54s -> 14357.37s]  crackers come on that's actually kind of funny the wretched dung eater that's not what i was
[14357.37s -> 14364.97s]  saying and you know it don't put words in my elf or i'll ban everybody this should work now
[14364.97s -> 14378.17s]  slipped over the tip of the branch take the ring that's fine i can break the branch snaps into
[14378.17s -> 14398.30s]  the ring goes off disappears into the nearby trees that's fine it did not go into the water scan the
[14398.30s -> 14417.98s]  forest look down from the view okay climb down did it work yeah the undergrowth here is quite thick
[14417.98s -> 14422.95s]  and despite thrashing at the bushes you cannot see any hint of the ring that fell from the tower
[14422.95s -> 14427.59s]  it may not even have fallen this close to the tower base so is most likely at the bottom of
[14427.59s -> 14449.29s]  the marsh by now what unspeakable i'm floating you are not floating high enough to clear the
[14449.29s -> 14481.35s]  tangled bushes oh fuck off shit force field no no where how do i get that ring i don't know how
[14481.35s -> 14501.19s]  to get the ring but whatever uh i need to aim it this way just let it go dude let it go yeah
[14507.06s -> 14527.16s]  yeah all right i need to move this though i don't know i don't know how to do it the bridge is
[14527.16s -> 14572.78s]  successfully repaired kind of ah is that accurate hard to tell i can't get the ring i don't know
[14572.78s -> 14584.26s]  it's i gotta do something like very special and specific okay i have to kill the seven serpents
[14584.26s -> 14617.66s]  not talk to them this doesn't look like it's connected is it though it kind of is okay it
[14617.66s -> 14627.11s]  breaks up every now and again though uh i have to teleport see it's like broken up can i climb
[14627.11s -> 14646.50s]  this okay like can i climb up here climb the pillar here we go all right let's do it there's
[14646.50s -> 14664.26s]  no way up the bridge from here really i have to go over here then i can climb the bridge in the
[14664.26s -> 14687.42s]  past i should probably teleport to here and then walk yeah that is the past you could have gotten
[14687.42s -> 14703.86s]  a serpent ring in kare it's okay you can't get every item you can't get every single item just
[14703.86s -> 14709.66s]  to make sure i'm gonna aim this one over there too we're hitting this with every single one
[14709.66s -> 14721.06s]  looks like you're playing the elden ring map one of the first things i thought about when i saw
[14721.06s -> 14729.93s]  the elden ring map was that it looked exactly like sorcery and i love the style of this map
[14729.93s -> 14736.49s]  it's super mysterious like the little buildings are just kind of it's not like oh look at this
[14736.49s -> 14739.70s]  here's the point of interest here's what it is it's just kind of like a little hut
[14739.70s -> 14751.86s]  and you can go look at it i really like it a lot like for instance stuff like this is just
[14751.86s -> 14761.03s]  what even is that i don't know but i'm gonna go look at it oh yeah what is like what's this thing
[14761.03s -> 14768.18s]  i don't know seems like kind of like a broken down building i guess i'm gonna i want to see it
[14768.18s -> 14775.80s]  but it looks um pretty similar i love it so i'm glad it's here i'm glad they did an elden ring too
[14775.80s -> 14782.92s]  does skyrim do that does skyrim have a map like that fastest way to make me play that game
[14782.92s -> 14797.59s]  just kidding oh i have right i have to aim at this to get it to aim that way okay i am actually
[14797.59s -> 14809.35s]  gonna go teleport to that one you sound like you have a library card i actually don't
[14811.77s -> 14814.89s]  but the first thing you think of when you hear me talk is this guy reads a bunch of books
[14816.26s -> 14834.06s]  i don't know where you got that from it's almost kind of overlapping yeah it's overlapping oh p i'll
[14834.06s -> 14846.78s]  keep your leg right here all right let's go to the bridge finally it's time to cross into the next
[14846.78s -> 14861.03s]  area in the time between the sorcery streams i was able to beat sorcery one through four normal and
[14861.03s -> 14867.62s]  new game plus i love this game thanks for introducing me to it i am ecstatic that you said
[14867.62s -> 14888.49s]  that genuinely okay here we go at least somebody is finishing it um it's been 295 days since the
[14888.49s -> 14894.50s]  last sorcery stream before these last couple they've had a lot of time to play it if they
[14894.50s -> 14910.31s]  don't mean like in the last two days they mean in the last year uh i think it's safe here wait
[14910.31s -> 14916.65s]  hold on all right we have been through this area a couple times but we have an event here you stretch
[14916.65s -> 14921.13s]  out and rest suddenly all around you goes quiet the night air itself seems to still you hear a
[14921.13s -> 14935.96s]  distant voice listen you stay quiet and strain your ears to listen greetings in tones of voice
[14935.96s -> 14945.10s]  aged and self-satisfied i trust the backlands are treating you kindly as my fair city it takes a
[14945.10s -> 14957.05s]  moment to place the voice it is lorag the wizard of kare what are you doing here i'm here to help
[14957.05s -> 14964.78s]  as you helped me in my fair city you have a message in a language you do not understand
[14964.78s -> 14981.64s]  i may be of some assistance very well i would be glad of your aid in the marsh you were given a
[14981.64s -> 14988.82s]  parchment show it to me you pull out the parchment given to you by the goblins and you begin to feel
[14988.82s -> 14993.69s]  a strange sensation as if someone else was controlling your eyes moving them backwards
[14993.69s -> 15002.95s]  and forwards across the words that's creepy read you have little choice but to read yes
[15003.59s -> 15012.54s]  i was right to come you feel your finger lift and tap the paper it is most interesting indeed most
[15012.54s -> 15022.12s]  valuable the voice vanishes promptly what does it say but the wizard's presence has gone you are
[15022.12s -> 15029.29s]  quite alone once more and none of the wiser for it oh great you seem guarded here oh come on man
[15029.29s -> 15033.62s]  what did he just do he's you're gonna take that and what are you gonna do with it
[15033.62s -> 15044.10s]  typical lorag why would i yeah why would i trust lorag that was a bad idea lorag is like chaotic
[15044.10s -> 15051.58s]  neutral he's i mean he usually he's pretty chaotic evil i think sometimes you just got don't know
[15051.58s -> 15067.30s]  walled yeah okay well thanks for nothing lorag it's kind of a dick oh he's a he's a very he's
[15067.30s -> 15076.39s]  a big dick he's a super dick i would say that's a understatement the sunrise up so high is cold
[15077.11s -> 15087.78s]  you get to your feet here we go oh look it actually fades out i have to hit it as it's still
[15087.78s -> 15101.82s]  there you step onto the bridge the early morning sun makes the air glow keep going okay you make
[15101.82s -> 15107.05s]  your way under the stones of the bridge which form a broad solid path thick marsh we already know
[15110.44s -> 15119.96s]  yes we can still keep going gotta catch it the right moment oh come on don't do this to me
[15123.54s -> 15143.27s]  yes what the stones underfoot begin to disappear revealing a void below no oh come on i have to be
[15143.27s -> 15189.26s]  faster come on really shit that's very unfortunate missed it okay wait wait wait wait here's my idea
[15189.26s -> 15199.32s]  i need to wait and i need to i'm gonna i get a spam move on i have to wait till it's selectable
[15199.32s -> 15229.78s]  it's not it's not selectable for a second or two here comes where is it fuck you shit no
[15232.02s -> 15258.79s]  oh if i gotta go back and move one what's the problem here i have to sleep okay i gotta teleport
[15258.79s -> 15270.20s]  around i'll get there i'll get there i'll get it i'll get it i'll get it so then i guess this one
[15270.20s -> 15298.90s]  has to point over here how do i get the whole bridge to be intact i feel like i can hmm it's
[15298.90s -> 15318.78s]  probably i could probably get in the mountain somewhere too like in here or like down here
[15318.78s -> 15325.21s]  light up the end of the bridge and climb the middle part that's probably the right idea i'm
[15325.21s -> 15334.86s]  gonna go see if it's possible you have the beacons just wrong you can do it let's find out i thought
[15334.86s -> 15346.38s]  i had them in a fine place that was fine let me see can i all right if i go like this uh hold on a
[15346.38s -> 15372.30s]  second here watch this they're fighting each other that's why there we go so now that will be perfect
[15372.30s -> 15382.98s]  i have this the other one is aiming over here i have to turn that one away and i'll aim this one
[15382.98s -> 15411.05s]  this way um where should i point this we did this over here in both past and present i could aim it
[15411.05s -> 15416.86s]  in the this like marsh area yes this is probably a couple of events here that i have we didn't get
[15416.86s -> 15444.14s]  to this looks perfect now the only thing that's concerning me is this that's concerning me should
[15444.14s -> 15479.30s]  i be concerned i hope it's fine i think it's fine all right let's go very cool all right let's move
[15479.30s -> 15491.77s]  the third and fourth game they are a lot there's a lot of backtracking so this is not abnormal some
[15491.77s -> 15496.36s]  of the complaints of the third game in the third book series whatever you want to call it is people
[15496.36s -> 15502.73s]  don't want to do the go back and backtrack three times but i don't mind it i think the beams
[15502.73s -> 15518.23s]  they're going back in time and doing stuff differently i think it's fun all right move on
[15518.23s -> 15525.91s]  here we go yes finally gonna make it across the bridge i don't think this is gonna be a
[15525.91s -> 15535.50s]  problem i think we're good an eagle hovers above the valley waiting to scoop up its prey
[15535.50s -> 15546.18s]  i don't want to wait around for that you walk across the bridge a little light glows in the
[15546.18s -> 15551.14s]  east there are no handrails here sitting by the sheer drop at the edge of the road is a
[15551.14s -> 15557.51s]  starving looking man with legs folded beneath him and head bowed to the stone he is perhaps
[15557.51s -> 15566.71s]  asleep or drunk or dead let's wake him up you touch him on the shoulder and he sits up sharply
[15566.71s -> 15574.07s]  greetings well met spare a coin he slides his palm he perhaps does not have the energy to
[15574.07s -> 15584.07s]  lift across the stone what will you spend it on you ask noting his red rimmed eyes and two aged
[15584.07s -> 15593.96s]  skin that's my business isn't it i have to live don't i we talk very similar you and i here you
[15593.96s -> 15604.36s]  can have a coin use it wisely he nods thank you stranger all right let's get some info you open
[15604.36s -> 15609.24s]  your mouth preparing to ask the man for information to return for your gold but the words fail when
[15609.24s -> 15615.13s]  the beggar holds your gold coin out over the side of the bridge and lets it go it twinkles as it
[15615.13s -> 15623.80s]  sails out of sight that was careless what i dropped it i didn't fumble it i don't have the
[15623.80s -> 15633.80s]  shakes i'm not ill then why did you do that you demand somewhat outraged isn't falling wonderful
