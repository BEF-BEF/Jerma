[0.31s -> 16.77s]  This is not fair. Here's what I'm playing with. Floppy disk, ash cheeks, Illidan from Warcraft.
[16.77s -> 24.02s]  He's apparently really good at this. Oh, is that you across the way? No. Oh, come on. Bot Chris.
[24.02s -> 33.04s]  You hit- God, you hit me. Oh, that's you. Come play, baby. Dude, that's bot Steve. Come play.
[33.04s -> 39.35s]  There we go. There we go. No! Is that you? Okay, listen, don't get fancy. You got a kill.
[39.35s -> 47.49s]  Okay, I'm actually quite happy. Damn it. Damn it. I was almost at a three piece. I know you do. I know you do.
[47.49s -> 51.78s]  Okay, I'm coming over.
[51.78s -> 53.78s]  God, how did he come over?
[53.78s -> 56.58s]  What's up, dudes?
[56.58s -> 60.58s]  Hey, get out of here. Does this guy already have a pistol? No, he didn't.
[60.58s -> 66.20s]  Already has a pistol. You're starting with pistols, right? Bot Bill. Good thing it's Bot Bill.
[66.20s -> 72.95s]  Oh my God, I just missed a bot. Oh, it's up there. Wow. Turn off your game genie. Turn it off.
[72.95s -> 76.95s]  Game genie? Yeah, you got like game genie up there.
[76.95s -> 81.95s]  Oh, what are you doing? How many times have I touched you in the face like fucking five times?
[81.95s -> 88.38s]  Oh my God. Can't believe you died right there. But it's okay, dude. You gotta keep trying, you know.
[88.38s -> 96.20s]  You just gotta hang in there. Are you behind? That wasn't me, was it? No. I'm only in third place.
[96.20s -> 104.66s]  I'm getting destroyed by these guys. There we go. Let's clean it up here. Let's clean it up here.
[106.54s -> 111.84s]  Bot Tom with a life... Jesus. Bot Tom going hard.
[111.84s -> 114.84s]  I'm afraid to go over there, man. I feel like he's gonna shoot me in the face.
[114.84s -> 122.56s]  Or that'll happen. I'll just drop down like Spider-Man and get myself killed.
[122.56s -> 130.32s]  Oh God, where am I? Where am I going? No! What are you doing in the spawn? What are you doing in the spawn, Jeremy?
[130.32s -> 134.32s]  I'm spawning. What else do you do in spawn? Yeah, I thought you were spawn camping, dude.
[134.32s -> 139.32s]  What are you doing in spawn is the real question. I was chasing... I was looking for you guys.
[139.32s -> 148.42s]  Wow. You were nowhere. That was just BS right there. I don't believe it. I called BS with that one.
[148.42s -> 158.94s]  Oh, I'm doing great. Oh God. Floppy disk.
[158.94s -> 162.88s]  Thanks for standing still, Bot Bill. Give me the free headshot.
[162.88s -> 170.31s]  You're getting free kills off of the bots? Come on, dude. You don't want to be that guy. Oh! No, no, no, no.
[170.31s -> 175.55s]  Total commit... Floppy disk, I swear. Thanks, Bot Bill.
[175.55s -> 181.55s]  How many free kills are you getting off Bot Bill right now? I got at least two free kills off Bot Bill.
[181.55s -> 189.98s]  So not fair. Are you kidding me? Get out of here. Wait, is this our spawn? Yeah, I think this is... Wow, I'm in the wrong spawn.
[189.98s -> 196.98s]  Did they switch? They might switch. No, I don't think... This is not called duty, dude. No, they don't switch, no.
[196.98s -> 204.93s]  Who's that? Okay, Wretch with a big booty. That's the picture. Yeah. That's a nice booty you got there, Wretch.
[204.93s -> 214.69s]  Oh, come on. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. What? I just got hit in the face. God, with that aim.
[214.69s -> 225.30s]  Is it a bot or no? No, that was you. Oh. Oh. Feel it. That was you with the... Hold on, let me trash talk for a bit.
[225.30s -> 233.54s]  Oh, get on my level. Oh. Are you mad? Are you mad? Hey, Bot Bill, stand still again so I can get some kills.
[233.54s -> 240.36s]  Oh, somebody just saved me. It may have been Bot Bill. Bot Bill, is that you? God, I'm getting...
[240.36s -> 252.08s]  I'm on the pistols right now and I'm getting screwed on. Oh. Is that you? Yeah. Good aim, dude.
[252.08s -> 264.50s]  Yeah, I was aiming. I hate these guns, these LMGs. Bot Bill, Bot Bill's mine. Oh, wait, it's on my team, never mind.
[264.50s -> 276.71s]  Whoa. That big booty of Wretch's is getting all kinds of kills on me. Make it stop. Where do you come from?
[276.71s -> 285.85s]  I came from behind. I don't know, I think I jumped down or I either spawned down there. Behind. Yeah, you're looking good from behind, Jerma.
[285.85s -> 300.82s]  Looking real good. You look beautiful. Beautiful. I can't believe it. I can't believe I didn't get that guy in the face.
[300.82s -> 314.86s]  No, I wish that was you. I wish that was you so bad. But no. No, but too many people. Too many people.
[314.86s -> 321.83s]  I'm stuck on a little like dipshit pistol. You're probably caught up with me, dude. Look at all these...
[321.83s -> 331.97s]  You got your whole team is over here. Don't shoot me, Jerma. No, fall damage. Are you kidding me? Well, that's embarrassing.
[331.97s -> 342.71s]  I've got to reset a level. Oh, mediocre, you... Suck on it. Suck on the justice.
[342.71s -> 350.40s]  I would have had so much joy from that. That is what we call the justice, Pinai. Get on it.
[350.40s -> 365.35s]  All right, all right, time to take over. This guy Rio, AD and like a pro. It's gonna be fun. Man, oh man.
[365.35s -> 376.30s]  I just have to wait and then strike. Get out of here. Oh, no. Wow. That was you, huh? Trying to go for the knife kill on me.
[376.30s -> 387.82s]  That wasn't me. No. Second and third, though, man. Ain't too bad for the first game. Let's go to the monastery.
[387.82s -> 396.20s]  I don't care. Here we go. Let's do it. Time to be fancy. Going up right. It's going up two o'clock. Two o'clock.
[397.20s -> 406.46s]  The starting route in the game. Yeah. Watch my videos for tips and tricks.
[406.46s -> 414.95s]  How? What the hell was that? It's almost like I was shooting a time crisis machine that wasn't calibrated.
[414.95s -> 423.61s]  My shots were going like five feet to the right. Somebody at the arcade didn't calibrate the goddamn light gun.
[423.61s -> 435.86s]  That's what it looks like. Oh, I'm getting some kills. Not gonna lie. Doing solid. Camping their spawns like a boss.
[435.86s -> 443.11s]  Get that guy. Yeah. Camping their spawns like a boss. Like a B.O.
[443.11s -> 449.76s]  I'm scared. Oh, I just came from their spawn. I just shot you.
[449.76s -> 454.96s]  Because I was scared. I don't know. I thought you were like an enemy. You're like trigger happy.
[454.96s -> 462.59s]  There we go. I'm doing some damage. Not gonna lie. Bot Chris. Playing like a badass. No.
[462.59s -> 468.90s]  That's like my first death in like ever. Yeah. In ever. Well, not forever, but in this game.
[468.90s -> 475.27s]  How did you kill that guy? And I didn't. Hey, dude. Don't be mad. Get even.
[475.27s -> 482.41s]  I, what? This is possible. I love playing CSGO with you, dude. Thanks.
[485.90s -> 494.11s]  Not gonna lie. That actually startled me. I actually got startled by what just happened. Oh, God. This guy.
[494.11s -> 498.49s]  What is he doing? I just stole another kill.
[499.49s -> 504.73s]  Dude, I'm still a level three. I should be at least at like level six.
[504.73s -> 516.54s]  Oh, finally. I get like a shot on somebody. Come on, Chris. There we go. Come on, Chris.
[516.54s -> 522.92s]  Come on, Chris. Where they at? Oh, behind. Behind. Behind.
[522.92s -> 530.85s]  Chasing down my bot. Ooh. Hello. I'll take you down. Where is everybody? I wanna play the game.
[532.15s -> 537.15s]  I'm killing them, dude. Yeah, I got him. I'm on an 18 streak. I'm doing pretty solid.
[537.15s -> 542.40s]  Ooh. Lucky me. That guy was just getting lit up.
[542.40s -> 548.05s]  I love when there's like four dudes shooting at the same guy. I know. Like, yeah, I think I'm gonna die.
[548.05s -> 554.78s]  Oh. Oh, no. Apparently, he has phantom bullets that were going through you and hitting me in the face.
[554.78s -> 559.65s]  But I think I died, so. Phantom of the Opera bullets.
[562.62s -> 570.18s]  Oh, bot, Chris. Get lit up. Oh, that's a lot of BS right there.
[576.06s -> 580.24s]  I tried. I jumped on and got the jump on him. It didn't even matter.
[587.42s -> 591.42s]  What happened? What the hell is this guy doing? This guy is just sitting.
[591.42s -> 595.05s]  Oh, no, no, no. Like, heaven forbid, I steal one of yours.
[596.05s -> 600.35s]  Heaven forbid. Heaven forbid you steal, like, a dozen of mine.
[603.59s -> 607.59s]  Dude, you stole, like, a Crayola crayon box set worth of kills from me.
[607.59s -> 611.59s]  There was at least 12 in that box. I want my orange and I want my blue and purple back.
[614.15s -> 617.78s]  Oh, well, then I'm gonna scream.
[619.78s -> 629.08s]  Yeah, living room set, baby. Who wants it? 799? 799? 799?
[629.08s -> 631.70s]  Holy crap, no!
[631.70s -> 633.94s]  I think somebody's on knife.
[633.94s -> 635.94s]  Yeah, it's almost the end of the game. You almost got me.
[636.94s -> 639.12s]  No! I could have gone that knife.
[639.12s -> 641.12s]  I'm terrified right now. I'm terrified.
[642.12s -> 644.12s]  Where is he? Yes!
[644.12s -> 646.12s]  Did you get him? On the AFK.
[647.12s -> 649.12s]  I had to get it. There we go.
[650.12s -> 653.81s]  Well, I want to thank my parents for raising me properly.
[653.81s -> 656.81s]  I want to thank Jerma for being a good sport while I stole all his kills.
[656.81s -> 658.81s]  And Gigi, that's pretty much it.
[658.81s -> 660.81s]  That's pretty much it.
[660.81s -> 662.81s]  GG.
