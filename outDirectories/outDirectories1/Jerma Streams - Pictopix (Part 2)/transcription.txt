[3.51s -> 22.20s]  Let's open up... I'm gonna change my tweet as well, because it is not correct. Let's get rid of that.
[22.20s -> 46.97s]  Let's put a new one up that just says, uh, Pic... Picross. Picross. All right. No. Picross. Picross.
[46.97s -> 63.42s]  I don't know what's right. How about just Picross now? That's fine. I'm okay with that. Hey, look
[63.42s -> 72.39s]  at that. All right, so those of you that are gonna stick around, we're just gonna play Picross.
[73.19s -> 77.19s]  We're gonna do Picross. Hey, Picross, ask me anything. How does that sound? Uh, ask me anything
[77.19s -> 99.02s]  Picross stream. Well, ask me almost anything. Oh god, that was a... kind of just opened that one up.
[99.02s -> 110.12s]  PictoPix. There it is. My favorite little thing to play. Let's get it on screen. Have you ever
[110.12s -> 117.34s]  played 3D Picross? I have. Ever gonna play Bayonetta 2? Uh, probably not. Are you gonna...
[119.98s -> 126.25s]  Am I gonna do Scrabble? I'm probably not gonna play Scrabble. What are all of your political
[126.25s -> 142.30s]  opinions? All right. Uh, hold on. Do I still have the Twitch integration? I think so. I think
[142.30s -> 155.21s]  it worked. Another 50 dollars from NotEKinz. I said it wrong. Thank you for the 50 bucks
[155.93s -> 167.96s]  correcting my mispronunciation. My goodness. This is like 400 dollars. I made like
[167.96s -> 179.54s]  four or five hundred fucking dollars by having a bootleg Dreamcast broken disc
[180.90s -> 195.03s]  and a top-down hard game that I gave up after like 45 minutes. Thank you guys. That's
[195.83s -> 204.25s]  fucking insane. Uh, I think the Twitch integration still works. Let's find out if it does.
[208.63s -> 218.06s]  PictoPix. There it is. So where did we leave off last time? So we made the mushroom, the boots,
[219.54s -> 227.03s]  and he's... I'm bragging. No, no. I'm fucking surprised is what I'm saying.
[227.75s -> 237.42s]  All right. Is Twitch integration working? It is. All right. So there is Twitch integration in
[237.42s -> 242.49s]  this game. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want you to play. I don't want you to play. I need
[242.49s -> 258.76s]  to relax. Wait, why is it? All right. So, okay. Let's fucking reboot the stream and play this
[259.32s -> 269.86s]  chill puzzle game. Everybody, here's how you play. So as you can see, 10 by 10. It's a
[269.86s -> 279.70s]  baby mode 10. We're just doing this to get everybody prepared. But no, let me be fair here,
[279.70s -> 286.26s]  though. There are probably a lot of people that are here that were not here last time
[286.90s -> 296.55s]  a week ago. So I... How do you... This is how you play. I'm going to do it. Time me.
[296.55s -> 305.24s]  I'll put a 30 second timer on screen. No, 10 second timer on screen. Ready? 10. So every
[305.24s -> 311.24s]  one of these numbers is a corresponding square. So for three, for instance, there's three squares
[311.24s -> 317.32s]  in a row down this column here, right? So I don't know where it is. I have to use deduction.
[317.32s -> 322.23s]  See? Nine. That means there are nine here. Every time there's a space, there has to be
[322.23s -> 333.02s]  at least one cube in between this number. Got it. Time's up. That's how you play.
[333.02s -> 339.74s]  So we got... That's it right there. Actually, no, that can't be certain. One, two, three,
[339.74s -> 344.34s]  four, five, six, seven, eight. Yeah, that can't be certain. You weren't listening? Just enjoy
[344.34s -> 352.89s]  the pictures and enjoy the hangout session. See? I know this is two here. Where's my X?
[352.89s -> 358.26s]  There it is. So remember, I know for a fact there's no way because this one has to be a
[358.26s -> 365.24s]  space. We're just going to relax. Are you going to shit talk Joel again? No, this is
[365.24s -> 372.49s]  my relax session. I'm not shit talking anybody right now. So for instance, we've got three,
[372.49s -> 384.14s]  six, seven, eight, nine. Not enough. And you can... I'm not using it right now, but there is
[384.14s -> 391.50s]  Twitch integration. So you're probably going, well, how did you... Because this is nine out
[391.50s -> 396.57s]  of 10. These have to be filled in for this to make any sense. Same thing with seven,
[396.57s -> 402.57s]  right? Seven, as you see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four,
[402.57s -> 408.30s]  five, six, seven has to be there. Which, hey, look at that. We now know that the three is
[408.30s -> 420.39s]  either here or here. Right? You understand? And this guy... Oh, right. The spam. I probably
[420.39s -> 426.81s]  should just turn it off. Should I just turn off the integration until I let you guys play around?
[426.81s -> 436.84s]  I don't mean to spam. It's not me spamming. All right. So we've got one, two, three, four,
[436.84s -> 443.26s]  five. One, two, three, four, five. Can't do that. Let's see. Five, two. This is one.
[443.26s -> 449.40s]  There's a one here. Eight. So I told you like I told you before. I know that it has to be
[449.40s -> 462.46s]  there. Okay. And we got two. There's only one more here. Am I going to play stunt man? Yeah,
[462.46s -> 470.14s]  I will. You can complete it. Yeah. You guys, every like two or three, I usually let chat do one.
[470.14s -> 474.20s]  So interestingly enough, see how we have this block here. This has to be seven in a row.
[474.20s -> 479.16s]  Therefore, see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. These have to be filled in. One,
[479.16s -> 484.07s]  two, three, four, five, six, seven. Paying attention. I'm happy that you are. Take a
[484.07s -> 487.75s]  look what happened here. This is five. So one, two, three, four, five. Already done.
[489.70s -> 493.86s]  This is also already done. So we can feel the whole rolling. This is also not done completely.
[493.86s -> 500.39s]  See how there's nothing else here. It's grayed out, which leaves. Hey, look at that. Two.
[500.39s -> 512.07s]  And what happened here? Three, space, two. It's that simple. Whenever we do it together,
[512.07s -> 519.13s]  we just try to screw you. We're space Michael. Wait, there actually is music.
[519.13s -> 524.39s]  It was turned off because it just, it's the same song. It's the same like jazz piano.
[532.68s -> 540.22s]  Boring. Whatever. All right. So let's see. What do we get to work with here?
[541.10s -> 549.46s]  This is done completely. There's still a couple here. Seven, five. So one, two, three, four,
[549.46s -> 553.14s]  five. One, two, three, four, five. I think we can do more than a few of these.
[553.94s -> 558.14s]  Two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Yep. All right. So three, three.
[558.86s -> 566.70s]  Mark them. So there's a one here somewhere. This song makes me want to shit. No,
[566.70s -> 573.46s]  we're not doing the brown nose joke again. Where's the one here though?
[574.26s -> 584.20s]  Play Chowder Man instead. No Chowder Man. It probably is just one, two, three, four, five.
[585.08s -> 589.54s]  No, it's definitely not here because if this is the, if this is the two,
[589.54s -> 593.70s]  right, then there's nothing there. So you have to assume one, two, three, four, five.
[594.42s -> 604.26s]  And there's three, which leaves that. That's done. Put on Chowder Man.
[604.26s -> 606.58s]  You guys really want me to put on Chowder Man. Do you really want that?
[607.30s -> 618.02s]  I have a, why is there a command that says I have a YouTube channel where I upload my
[618.02s -> 628.20s]  videos in 4k? That's a lie. That's not real. All right. I'll play Chowder Man for like 30 seconds.
[648.55s -> 657.21s]  Okay. So take a look here. Three, one, two, there's a block. One. No, it has to be
[657.21s -> 661.85s]  somewhere in here. Therefore one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. That has to
[661.85s -> 676.66s]  be it. This row is done. This row is done. This song is killing me. Make it louder.
[680.36s -> 690.06s]  You don't actually want this to be louder. Hey, look, it has to be there. It has to be here.
[691.53s -> 694.49s]  And then you got two. Let's see. We cleared out this, this.
[699.64s -> 720.09s]  All right. You want to stop talking? Fine. It's probably here. It's just Dig Dug. No,
[720.09s -> 734.31s]  it's not Dig Dug. This is probably just right here. So, oh, you can, by the way,
[734.31s -> 746.79s]  hashtag guess. You can guess what it is. I wonder if it's down here. It might be like
[746.79s -> 758.79s]  here. What the hell am I doing? Chowder Man, sir. I don't know what the fuck I just did
[758.79s -> 765.98s]  that for. I just fucked the whole thing up. I just tried to complete it by guessing. I don't
[765.98s -> 777.80s]  remember which way it was. This is not really there. There's definitely some type of C
[777.80s -> 794.39s]  person. Fixed A7. No, that's not right though. All right. This is literally causing
[794.39s -> 801.03s]  my brain to cease functioning. It's actually making my brain cease to function playing that
[801.03s -> 817.61s]  song. Is it Garfield? It's not Garfield. Then that is here. It's probably here.
[818.33s -> 833.61s]  Let me just fill that in. Uh-huh. Yep. The question is, yeah. It really, it just beef
[833.61s -> 849.11s]  brain me. What is it? Is it Sonic? Sonic the Diver? All right. What's next? This is
[849.19s -> 874.18s]  called Hot Dad? Oh, that's the artist. Oh, okay. We'll just keep it on. All right. Here
[874.18s -> 884.87s]  we go. So you're just doing how it works. Good. Let's see. That one's going to be
[890.60s -> 901.45s]  one, one, one, down, five, one, two, three, four, five. Bingo. These I can't tell. That's all the
[901.45s -> 905.37s]  ones there. Hey, look at that. You got to be here. You got to be here. You got to be here.
[905.37s -> 908.73s]  No, you don't. That's not even true. Why am I even pretending that that's the real answer?
[909.69s -> 927.02s]  It could be either side. One, one, one, one, somewhere in here. That works. And then
[927.02s -> 936.34s]  let's see. This is four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.
[936.90s -> 945.98s]  Yep. Here's your two. It was there actually. It's definitely here too. It kind of has to be.
[946.78s -> 956.73s]  But I don't know that yet. Yes, I do. They get to four. So we got one, two, three, four.
[956.73s -> 970.98s]  One, two, three, four. Look at that. Three, one, two. Here's the one here. So that's
[971.78s -> 985.06s]  four down. This is done. So that's here. Okay. Here's your four. Tools. Looks like a question
[985.06s -> 1012.87s]  mark so far. Seven. I have to have my tools. One, it has to be here. There's two, two. There
[1012.87s -> 1027.86s]  it is. What is it? Hey, it's a paint roller. Who got it? Nice work guys. You want to play
[1027.86s -> 1034.57s]  Splatoon music? Oh no. Splatoon as in that's what that looks like. Yeah, I got you. But
[1036.62s -> 1045.06s]  let me play. I'll only do one more and you guys can do it. Pizza song.
[1045.06s -> 1062.68s]  This guy, C-Man doesn't have an OST. I don't think so. Play the theme from Margo's Wet
[1062.68s -> 1073.66s]  Nurse. Wait, isn't that the song that goes like, yeah, this song's fucked up.
[1078.18s -> 1087.77s]  All right. I'll do one more and you guys can do one. Three, four, five, six, seven,
[1087.77s -> 1100.92s]  eight. No. Wait, hold on. Three. Actually, hold on here. That's three. These ones has to be here.
[1100.92s -> 1113.14s]  Yeah. What a creepy fucking stream this is. Hey guys, I'm just playing Picross and listening
[1113.14s -> 1127.34s]  to weird like fucking lullaby music. Are you guys enjoying the stream? Yeah, this went off
[1127.34s -> 1148.18s]  the rails, huh? Let's see. Two. It could be, no, it has to be here. One, two, three.
[1148.50s -> 1157.83s]  No. How many teeth do I have? Let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[1158.87s -> 1162.63s]  eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. I have fourteen teeth.
[1163.35s -> 1188.28s]  That's pretty good. What the hell is this? It's a cartoon. What kind of fucked up cartoon is
[1188.28s -> 1210.90s]  this? One, two, one. What is this? Cartoon? Speech bubble. How would you get that?
[1215.64s -> 1234.82s]  Anybody get that? All right. Well, I'm gonna do one more and you guys do one. My last one. He's
[1234.82s -> 1241.51s]  addicted. It is very addicting that this game is so addicting. I would put it in my top,
[1241.51s -> 1247.58s]  probably my top 250. Seven to eight out of ten games I think I've played over my life
[1247.58s -> 1254.90s]  that I sometimes like to play sometimes. Wait, that's not true. This might be part of the,
[1254.90s -> 1261.14s]  no, it has to be. One more. It's just like crazy taxi. You get to,
[1261.14s -> 1269.24s]  we get to guess the picture together. See, this is probably a field goal. Let's see. One,
[1269.24s -> 1281.66s]  one. That's two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. So here we go. This one's for
[1281.66s -> 1296.33s]  free. I love getting them for free. How long is this song? Might as well play the winter
[1296.33s -> 1301.83s]  lantern singing. Oh, I remember how terrifying that was. The one that goes.
[1306.42s -> 1312.04s]  Is that what's coming up? Now this is a real good one. This is the, this is Garman.
[1312.04s -> 1315.91s]  All right. Spoiler alert. If you haven't played Bloodborne, it's one of the best
[1315.91s -> 1319.43s]  games ever made. Go play it and then come back and watch the stream. Try to beat it
[1319.43s -> 1328.74s]  in like less than two or three hours. So that's one, one. It's probably four. Yeah,
[1329.38s -> 1363.64s]  this is a drink. It's Glitch, the twitchy mode. Deal. It is the three. Unbelievable.
[1363.64s -> 1372.46s]  Okay. Look, can I just say if Sekiro is even 10% of how fun and amazing I think
[1372.46s -> 1383.66s]  Bloodborne was, it's going to be game of the century for me. So it has to be here.
[1384.38s -> 1394.14s]  I can see it coming together.
[1399.54s -> 1415.74s]  Possibly one. That's gotta be there. We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[1421.37s -> 1426.89s]  Here it comes. Yeah. The best part. The best part of the whole song.
[1427.69s -> 1433.13s]  At the end of the games that I'm excited for. I mean, Sekiro is just, is number one.
[1436.98s -> 1440.50s]  I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for a From Software game that's not Dark Souls
[1441.86s -> 1446.68s]  since Bloodborne released. And that's not to say anything that's anything wrong with Dark Souls.
[1447.32s -> 1458.73s]  I just like when they do something a little different. All right. What is it? We've got it.
[1458.73s -> 1469.03s]  It's like a beer. Beer glass. Oh, some of you guys got fucking destroyed. One, two, three, four,
[1469.03s -> 1473.35s]  five, six. So only seven or eight of you got it right. All right. I'm gonna do one more.
[1473.35s -> 1486.42s]  You guys can take it. Last one. It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[1487.22s -> 1496.68s]  It's our turn. I'll give you one more. You guys can get a go. Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[1496.68s -> 1506.07s]  eight. Not quite. One, three, one, one, five. I mean, it kind of has to be here.
[1507.03s -> 1516.12s]  That doesn't help me very much though. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Also
[1516.12s -> 1527.05s]  part of a four and one. He's never gonna let us have our turn. Four, five, six, seven, eight,
[1527.05s -> 1539.05s]  nine. No, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That has to be the three. And look at that.
[1539.05s -> 1547.54s]  When you really solve it, it itches a part of your brain. So this is one, two, three, four,
[1547.54s -> 1556.87s]  one, two. It can't be any of these. Let's go ahead and do this. It could be two and then
[1556.87s -> 1562.63s]  six. I'm not sure. This is the most intense PictoCross stream with this music. Yeah.
[1563.43s -> 1583.18s]  I like it. It's think music. Two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, that two and the six
[1583.18s -> 1591.85s]  is three, right? Look at the one, three, one. One, two, three. This has to be part of the three,
[1591.85s -> 1598.76s]  right? Because if it was one, two, three. No, this is the three here. Got the ones.
[1599.56s -> 1604.36s]  This is also a one. There's your two. I think the same thing's gonna happen here. It is
[1605.24s -> 1614.58s]  three. Get that space down. And then there's your two. There's your six. Now let's see.
[1614.74s -> 1620.90s]  This is three. This is part of the four. It has to be. There's your two. There's your one.
[1623.53s -> 1637.37s]  What is this an image of? How do you go from that to Gwyn? Come on, Gwyn. Watch it. Watch it.
[1637.37s -> 1655.03s]  One, two, three. One, two, three, four. Come on, Gwyn. Come on. Got it. Okay. I'm gonna laugh
[1655.03s -> 1662.46s]  if this is like gingerbread house. We got it. A lot of you got it this time. All right.
[1662.54s -> 1667.82s]  All right. All right. All right. It's time for you guys to play. This is fruits. I'll make it. I'll
[1667.82s -> 1685.88s]  give it to you right here. Have fun. Get it done. Every five, every like eight seconds,
[1685.88s -> 1697.14s]  it fills up whatever the most typed into chat. Write for it again. Did I get teleported
[1697.78s -> 1707.99s]  like a week and a half ago? Did I think I went through a wormhole and I'm in the sea? Yeah,
[1707.99s -> 1718.01s]  doing the same thing. All right. I'm telling you right now, if you guys fill this cube,
[1720.34s -> 1725.78s]  you did it. You accomplished it. Congratulations. But I'm taking control back for the rest of the
[1725.78s -> 1741.18s]  stream. You beat the game at that point. You get the game over. You see the end credits. That's it.
[1748.02s -> 1751.22s]  All of a sudden, everyone's like, no, no, shit. Remove that. Remove, remove it.
[1751.94s -> 1756.34s]  He might be serious. Don't fuck with him today. He got it. He played a bootleg
[1756.34s -> 1779.43s]  Dreamcast game. He's already on edge. I'm gonna get like chat on screen. How do I do this?
[1779.43s -> 1786.36s]  Can I pin this? How do I pin the chat window on top of this game?
[1787.08s -> 1816.54s]  Yeah, I can do that, right? Pin. Pin this window. Customize. How do I pin this? How do I use pin a
[1816.54s -> 1827.14s]  Firefox tab? Are you guys doing it? You know, you're clearing everything. Good. I actually
[1827.14s -> 1839.74s]  don't know how fucking I can do this. The large vocal in wrong stream chat. I'm not judging
[1839.74s -> 1850.58s]  anybody. What are you talking about? Right click the top of the window. All right. While
[1850.58s -> 1875.37s]  you guys fill in the same thing over and over again. It's I think an add on. Oh, that is a good
[1875.37s -> 1882.87s]  one. Daughter of the Cosmos. That is that's probably one of the better songs in the whole
[1882.87s -> 1903.16s]  soundtrack. All right. I'm about to I'm about to grab the wheel. You guys are falling asleep
[1903.16s -> 1928.86s]  here. Like, come on. What is this? Take control back, please. I'm drawing every toss.
[1936.65s -> 1939.93s]  Stop. What do you mean stop? You guys you guys just keep going like this.
[1947.64s -> 1959.45s]  You just did it for me. You just did it while I was showing you. All right. Okay. Why would
[1959.45s -> 1969.11s]  you clear this? We almost had it. Clean slate. Look, I'll leave what you guys did. There you
[1969.11s -> 1984.17s]  go. Oh, good. End the stream. No thoughts on the Halo Master Chief collection coming to
[1984.17s -> 1995.56s]  steam. That's actually kind of cool because I never really played them. When is that
[1995.56s -> 2014.81s]  expected to be there? This year there's no date. Oh, that's cool though. Yeah, back when
[2014.81s -> 2020.74s]  Halo was a big deal. I mean, it's not like it's not anymore, but when it was a really
[2020.74s -> 2029.00s]  big deal. I didn't have a regular Xbox. I didn't have I had like a 64 PlayStation 2.
[2030.54s -> 2037.10s]  What is in the Master Chief collection? You guys are going into the second phase.
[2037.10s -> 2050.50s]  Yeah. All right. It's every single one but up to five. Wow. I thought it was just the
[2050.50s -> 2056.73s]  first three. That's kind of cool. Are you guys, are you doing it? Am I about to assume control?
[2059.29s -> 2065.69s]  That's it. This is going to be it. You win. Congratulations. You filled the cube.
[2073.88s -> 2082.68s]  Look it. You did it. You see the credits. Here they are. This song.
[2093.94s -> 2105.54s]  All right. All right. I'm going to fix this. This is a fruit. All right. The question is
[2105.54s -> 2109.80s]  how much is left in the song? No, I can't beat this in 10 seconds. Never mind. What's
[2109.80s -> 2119.48s]  next coming up there? What's the next Bloodborne song? No, this is Nicolás.
[2120.28s -> 2132.84s]  No, this one's too scary. I don't want this one. Cos. Or some say Cosum.
[2138.87s -> 2159.67s]  Gas coin's a good song. All right. Let me fix this. Boom, boom, boom. We've got five. One,
[2159.67s -> 2166.15s]  two, three, four, five. This is going to be part of the four. You got one, two, three, four.
[2166.15s -> 2173.19s]  Can't be here. That's really the only thing I can do. I want you in my room. Why? What are
[2173.19s -> 2182.12s]  you talking about? Oh, that's the boom, boom, boom, boom. I want you in my room. That song.
[2187.42s -> 2197.67s]  One space. One, two, three. Play that. I'll play that after this. We're going full on
[2197.67s -> 2204.46s]  copyright stream. I mean, the title of this is now Throwing the Towel, right?
[2205.10s -> 2217.14s]  Is that part of the one of the seven? I don't know. Destroy the Vod. No, I don't want to
[2217.14s -> 2233.80s]  destroy it. Two, two, maybe four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Not quite. Hi, Vod. Can you
[2233.80s -> 2248.31s]  hear me? That was one, two, three, four ones. It can't be any of these. Give us back
[2248.31s -> 2264.07s]  control. No. Hmm. I wonder which one this is. This is probably part of the four. Well,
[2264.07s -> 2271.05s]  this is, I'm going to, yeah, this is four if it's free. This is probably the seven. Yes,
[2271.05s -> 2283.02s]  it is. Right until he gives it back. I don't think you're going to get it. Sorry. You beat
[2283.02s -> 2294.38s]  the game. You did what you were trying to do. Four. What does that do? Five, one, two, three,
[2294.38s -> 2307.82s]  four, five. Let them play. They did and they won. They did a great job. I was very proud.
[2311.70s -> 2330.17s]  I was so happy. It was wondrous what they've done. What was it going to put on? Does anybody
[2330.17s -> 2334.89s]  know what the name of that song is? Is it just called Boom Boom Boom? Or is it called I Want
[2334.89s -> 2357.66s]  You In My Room? There it is. This is the one that goes. We like to party. We like
[2357.90s -> 2381.45s]  to party. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Right? No, it's different. Look, I already threw in the towel.
[2382.01s -> 2414.94s]  I don't even have to explain myself louder. I'm not going to pretend. I know that part.
[2415.50s -> 2441.66s]  Here it comes. And then here's the Minecraft part. Yep. What is it?
[2461.13s -> 2467.14s]  So, um, last night when I was going to bed. Oh, I forgot to tell you about my dream. Oh
[2467.14s -> 2471.46s]  my God. Is that this dream is fucking worth sticking around for. I hope you stayed here
[2472.34s -> 2474.66s]  from the beginning of the stream. If you left and you were like, oh fuck, this is
[2474.66s -> 2478.26s]  kind of all fucked up. We'll try again tomorrow. No, you've stuck around for this long. You're
[2478.26s -> 2483.38s]  going to get one of the most ridiculous dreams I've ever had. So listen to this.
[2484.58s -> 2492.02s]  I'm in my bedroom and there's a knock at my door. I go to look through the people
[2492.02s -> 2496.02s]  and there's a bunch of company. Oh, fuck. Oh, there's people coming over. Oh,
[2496.02s -> 2500.10s]  my house is not ready. Oh, just a minute. Right. Hold on a second. And I'm like picking
[2500.10s -> 2505.22s]  up underwear on the floor and grabbing shit and throwing stuff in the laundry. What's over here?
[2506.42s -> 2513.62s]  Sweep, sweep. Right. There is dog shit all over the floor and all outside. Right. So I'm
[2513.62s -> 2519.94s]  picking up shit with my bare hands. Just picking up like pile of like auto shit,
[2519.94s -> 2524.82s]  pile of auto shit, pile of auto shit. And I go to answer the door
[2526.02s -> 2532.42s]  and I'm cupping like five or six shits in my hand. Like to try to magician hide them,
[2532.42s -> 2537.70s]  like as if they're not there. It stinks wicked fucking bad. It's unbearable.
[2537.70s -> 2544.42s]  And I'm holding them like down below behind me. And I open the door and everyone kind of
[2544.42s -> 2548.74s]  starts to come in like, oh, hey, how are you? Oh, good to see you again. Yeah. Well,
[2548.74s -> 2553.30s]  you put that you put your jacket over there. And I have like a lot of shit in my hand
[2553.30s -> 2559.06s]  and nobody really knows yet. I spend the next what seemed to be 20 to 30 straight minutes.
[2560.10s -> 2563.94s]  I couldn't get out. I couldn't like sneak out to the bathroom. I couldn't go upstairs.
[2563.94s -> 2568.42s]  I couldn't. No, no, no, no. I'm greeting people coming in and like hiding this fucking
[2568.42s -> 2574.07s]  baseball of shit. And everybody I'm doing so good. I'm getting the hang of this.
[2575.35s -> 2581.19s]  No one is stopping to like look at my hand. This is brain power. We already heard this.
[2582.18s -> 2588.10s]  So finally, I get an opportunity to like, yeah, oh, hey, hi, Mary. How are you? I have to hug
[2588.10s -> 2592.34s]  this lady. Like, oh, she comes in for a hug. I got to what I what am I gonna do?
[2592.34s -> 2596.98s]  I've got two hands here. One of them is has a wad of dog shit. So I put my hand around and
[2596.98s -> 2604.52s]  do like the hover hand on one side and like pat with the right hand. Now, somebody else looks
[2604.52s -> 2610.65s]  over here and sees what's happening. What's in my hand. And I have this little like,
[2610.65s -> 2614.49s]  yeah, but they didn't. I don't know. I don't think they really grasped what it was. They just,
[2614.49s -> 2619.67s]  I kind of had like eye beams going towards my left hand. It was holding like a martini glass.
[2619.67s -> 2624.07s]  Like, what the fuck is she doing? And I'm like, I'll be right back. And I run into the
[2624.07s -> 2628.15s]  bathroom. Then I finally get in there. And I think I'm like safe. And I just like this.
[2629.26s -> 2634.78s]  I go like this, right? I go like into the toilet. I don't know why I could have just
[2634.86s -> 2643.05s]  placed it but I like I like yo yo it down like into the fucking toilet. And my hand is just
[2643.05s -> 2653.98s]  it's just caked with shit. And that's when I woke up. Glad he stuck around for that one.
[2653.98s -> 2656.86s]  It was the most panic induced and I thought it was real, right? You everybody you always
[2656.86s -> 2665.24s]  think a dream is real while it's happening. But somewhere in that halfway to end of that
[2665.24s -> 2674.36s]  dream, I like I could feel that people knew what was going on. And that's the panic there.
[2674.36s -> 2693.02s]  I forgot it was a dream. I was there for that. No, it was fucking ridiculous. And first of all,
[2693.02s -> 2697.02s]  the number one thing you have to remember. Why is there a party going on at my house? Why
[2697.02s -> 2701.50s]  are there like a dozen fucking people coming in one after the other shaking hands? And why
[2701.50s -> 2707.26s]  is this shit all over my whole house? Like dog poo everywhere? What kind of fucked up slob
[2707.26s -> 2716.14s]  am I? And then I thought about it. And after I'm streaming tomorrow, but after tomorrow,
[2716.14s -> 2719.26s]  I'm going to be taking like probably three or four days off because I have like friends
[2719.26s -> 2730.30s]  coming up. Maybe that's why I had that dream. That's probably why. Anyways, back to the
[2731.10s -> 2736.81s]  back to the game. So I'm going to Yeah, it's a prophecy. Just make sure there's no
[2736.81s -> 2748.15s]  fucking dog shit all over the place. Take auto out. I have such weird dreams. My dreams
[2748.15s -> 2754.15s]  always just don't make any sense. I told you guys about the Gordon Ramsay one where
[2754.15s -> 2758.07s]  I didn't know if we were going to split the bill or not, right? That happened like last week,
[2758.07s -> 2769.58s]  two weeks ago. What the fuck am I? What's wrong with my brain? This one kind of got me here.
[2769.58s -> 2780.14s]  Six, one, two, three, four, five, six. Get that on this one. This one's five. So one,
[2780.14s -> 2789.69s]  two, this can be blocked. Is this the legendary PictoPix streamer? Yeah. I wouldn't say
[2789.77s -> 2816.15s]  legendary. What am I doing? You're legendary to me. Thank you. Thanks. No, seriously. Thank you.
[2820.63s -> 2825.75s]  So tomorrow on tomorrow's stream, we're probably going to have a little bit better luck.
[2831.53s -> 2836.42s]  I have a couple of plans for tomorrow. We'll see if they happen or not. I'm not done
[2836.42s -> 2846.15s]  streaming tonight. Don't worry. It's still going. Is that going to? No, is that impossible
[2846.15s -> 2850.63s]  for me to do that? One, two, three. No, I can't figure that out from here. One, two,
[2850.63s -> 2857.58s]  three, four, five. No. All right. I got one, two, three. One, two, three. Let's just mark X's.
[2858.46s -> 2874.74s]  It's not really going to help that much, but it's okay. Two, one, four, five, six. One, two,
[2874.74s -> 2881.30s]  three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Same deal on this one. Now the
[2881.30s -> 2885.46s]  question is, is this one, two, three, four, five? No, this is part of the five.
[2886.18s -> 2901.58s]  There's two, four, five. Close it. Wow. You've walked the span. Thanks. Idiot.
[2902.54s -> 2913.77s]  Huh? Oh, there's this people are spamming the song. I get it. I get it. I forgot there was
[2913.77s -> 2920.52s]  music playing. This is wrong. One, two, three, four, five, six. What happened here? This is
[2920.52s -> 2935.42s]  wrong. How did I do this? Oh, fuck. This is completely wrong. Shit. What was the last
[2935.42s -> 2948.78s]  thing I did? Uh-oh. Oh, no. What did I do wrong here? That's two, right? Two. Let me
[2948.78s -> 2951.66s]  just do, I think I can fix it a little bit later. Let me just see what happens here.
[2952.78s -> 2960.66s]  One of these rows is wrong, but it's okay. Two, two, uh-oh. No, this is the row that's
[2960.66s -> 2975.18s]  wrong. That's why. Okay. Because this has to be two down like that. All right. I got it.
[2975.18s -> 2989.16s]  I think I fixed it. Two, two, one. This is so wrong. How did I fuck this up this badly?
[3000.28s -> 3006.79s]  This is so, look at how incorrect this is. One, two, three, four, five. What?
[3017.32s -> 3030.14s]  Something went so horribly wrong. Oh, I gotta restart it. Sometimes you just have to detonate
[3030.14s -> 3045.14s]  it and come and do it again. What's next? I don't know what this is. I'm so unreasonably
[3045.14s -> 3053.27s]  sad about Space Channel. Me too. It's okay, though. Can't happen every time. Even if
[3053.27s -> 3058.95s]  you plan something, it doesn't matter. It's okay. There's always next time. You know,
[3058.95s -> 3062.79s]  there's always another day. Don't worry. Everything's fine. I'm good. I feel great.
[3062.79s -> 3072.12s]  I feel great right now. I really do. What's another good, what's another little soundtrack?
[3072.12s -> 3093.64s]  Put on the Six Flags song? We like to party, right? Put on the Venga bus. You know,
[3093.64s -> 3100.31s]  people ask career advice sometimes. And what, what I should do, what, if you had advice,
[3100.31s -> 3108.74s]  Jerma, what would it be? Honest to fucking God, write a song that is catchy as fuck
[3110.30s -> 3115.82s]  and collect royalties for the next 2000 years. Your entire family will be,
[3115.82s -> 3121.29s]  just make a song like this. Just make one song that everybody that plays on Six Flags
[3121.29s -> 3126.25s]  commercials only need, you need one. You don't need an album full of great music. Just make
[3126.25s -> 3141.45s]  one good song and then Seinfeld it until you die. Just spend every waking moment of your life
[3141.45s -> 3150.10s]  trying to come up with one catchy song. That's pretty bad advice. Don't take that advice.
[3162.50s -> 3170.18s]  Collected fucking royalties forever, forever. We get a check for like a hundred thousand
[3170.18s -> 3195.85s]  dollars every year for this one fucking song. All right. I gotta pay attention. That's wrong.
[3195.85s -> 3209.34s]  And paid now happiness is just around the corner. Three thousand people are doing it right.
[3209.34s -> 3218.17s]  What? Let me, I got, I, I'm, this song is getting me. It's just catchy.
[3219.05s -> 3224.66s]  All right. So we've got five, two, I screwed it up here last time.
[3232.73s -> 3239.29s]  That's how I fucked it up before. Now I understand. Because I did five, five,
[3239.37s -> 3249.51s]  one instead of five, one down. That's where it all went so wrong. There we go. Fixed.
[3269.26s -> 3289.02s]  What does that say when you guys went to Six Flags? Now do it at time at 50% speed. Is it
[3289.02s -> 3315.54s]  still fun? It sounds like a different song. Don't you just want to fucking make this go
[3315.54s -> 3320.98s]  faster? In my brain, it's trying to be as fast as it should be and it's not letting it.
[3322.49s -> 3330.66s]  I hate this. This has to be here. One, two, three, because there's no way,
[3331.30s -> 3334.90s]  even if it's five or even the way this might be five here, then I'm,
[3334.90s -> 3356.84s]  no, okay. Even if this is the end, two has to be here. Four, four, three, five. All right.
[3356.84s -> 3370.14s]  I got it now. I'm going to look, people are going to leave. I've gained viewers since the
[3370.14s -> 3379.61s]  song has been on. Huh. See if that cult strip will go in point five, boys and girls.
[3412.89s -> 3416.41s]  All right. That hurt. That's giving me like anxiety. I need to stop doing that.
[3416.41s -> 3458.07s]  Oh, God damn it. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's not what I wanted today.
[3459.29s -> 3471.53s]  This is not what I wanted. Did anybody get it right? Okay. I'm stopping this.
[3471.53s -> 3478.46s]  No, some of you guys got it right. I want to do, let's do like a 15 by 15. Let's,
[3478.46s -> 3480.94s]  let's get a, let's do like a 20 by 20. Let's get a real one.
[3495.13s -> 3528.14s]  Why is this so slow? Oh, right. Cause it's still, what's going on? Dude, times two speed.
[3528.14s -> 3538.62s]  No, I want people to keep their brain cells, pump it up. No, I don't want to be that loud.
[3540.23s -> 3553.00s]  I'm going to wake up my neighbors. I want you in my room. Wait, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3553.00s -> 3557.96s]  I want you in my room. We'll spend the night together to get there in my room.
[3559.43s -> 3580.07s]  Boom. What? This is the same song. That's where I, that's, I'm going to call it there
[3580.07s -> 3589.32s]  right there. What else? What's this one? The coconut song. What does it say? 69 million
[3589.32s -> 3618.90s]  views. What is this? The coconut song. 70 million views. I don't see the appeal.
[3620.41s -> 3630.63s]  All right. What's this one? It just says coconut, coconut, coconut, coconut.
[3631.27s -> 3641.22s]  What the fuck is this stream? This is called throwing in the towel.
[3641.94s -> 3645.64s]  Let's all right. Fine. I'll give them another chance.
[3661.18s -> 3662.38s]  All right. This is actually, I like it.
[3662.38s -> 3689.19s]  Big, big nut, but this delicious nut is not a nut. This is probably one. Yeah, this is one.
[3689.19s -> 3690.39s]  No, I don't know. It might not be.
[3690.39s -> 3697.67s]  I don't have a lot of info to go on on this one.
[3710.20s -> 3716.33s]  I don't have any info. I got, I have info for this one, two, three, one, two, three.
[3717.45s -> 3722.42s]  I just don't know. This is 70 million views.
[3722.42s -> 3729.67s]  I need more info.
[3738.62s -> 3743.98s]  Where's my nut button? That's a good question.
[3747.42s -> 3747.98s]  I'm stuck here on this one.
[3755.72s -> 3762.87s]  Because pretty much anywhere I go would be technically incorrect without just guessing.
[3763.99s -> 3769.10s]  Let's just assume that this is one. Does that help us at all?
[3769.98s -> 3773.93s]  It kind of does. Assuming that this is one and not one, two.
[3777.77s -> 3790.07s]  That's a great song, but I can't, I need to think. What else we got here?
[3796.47s -> 3800.95s]  It was just getting good. No crazy frog. I did Beat Saber crazy frog. I'm not going
[3800.95s -> 3815.54s]  back to that hill. No, not the duck song. I always never liked that song.
[3823.53s -> 3829.26s]  You can always put the left cross regardless of one and two. Yeah, that's true.
[3834.49s -> 3840.46s]  I got one for you. I'm going to play this.
[3841.34s -> 3845.10s]  Everybody here right now, maybe you have some questions on whether or not.
[3845.10s -> 3848.14s]  I don't know if I like this guy. I've been here for a little while.
[3848.14s -> 3851.74s]  Maybe I've been around for a long time, but I'm having doubts that maybe this guy
[3851.74s -> 3854.30s]  knows how to run a stream or not. What a fucking idiot.
[3854.30s -> 3856.70s]  I'm about to change everyone's opinion because you're going to hear me play this
[3856.70s -> 3861.26s]  song and you're going to go, I automatically enjoy everything he's ever said or ever will do
[3861.26s -> 3866.76s]  or ever will say. Okay. Just making sure you guys are aware of that right now.
[3866.76s -> 3899.75s]  So that goes to see it for now. All right. We're good. Oops. Oops. Oops.
[3900.39s -> 3972.01s]  All right. It's 60%. That's fine. That's fine. I got a better idea. How about now?
[3972.73s -> 3990.30s]  How about now? What is it? How many people said, 27% said highly negative.
[3990.86s -> 4008.06s]  I mean, you did that for the joke. I appreciate it nonetheless.
[4008.62s -> 4026.47s]  Another remix of this song. Play the right version. What do you mean the right version?
[4026.47s -> 4040.58s]  All versions are good. Every version of this song is fantastic. This is incorrect.
[4040.58s -> 4064.36s]  What song is it? This is the moon theme from DuckTales Remastered.
[4068.36s -> 4075.05s]  Who knows what's coming up next? All right. Did I blow this? I may have.
[4075.77s -> 4087.54s]  Has to be here. I may have blown this. I'm not going to say I didn't.
[4087.54s -> 4107.00s]  I blew it. Maybe not. I blew it. What have I done?
[4107.32s -> 4126.82s]  Two busy pincers in the mood. Restarted. All right. I fucked it up. That's good.
[4126.82s -> 4138.42s]  It's okay. It's okay. Where was the first one? What have I done? I don't remember.
[4138.42s -> 4143.99s]  One. One, two, three, four. Block it. One, two, three, four. Block this.
[4145.03s -> 4152.63s]  This is just JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. No, no, no. I was about to mute it.
[4163.05s -> 4175.51s]  But she better be Smash Brothers DLC. Seriously. I don't want another Fire Emblem character.
[4176.23s -> 4190.49s]  The song is very bad. I didn't say it. You didn't.
[4191.30s -> 4194.98s]  All right. I got to pay attention to my fucking newspaper game from the 80s.
[4198.52s -> 4201.48s]  Distraction. Distracting. Distracting. Distracting.
[4210.46s -> 4215.80s]  What did I do the last time? I did... It was five. I don't remember.
[4215.80s -> 4217.32s]  This is assuming this is one, right?
[4239.05s -> 4245.54s]  Because then... No. No. This is not right. It's not correct.
[4246.26s -> 4252.66s]  You have all the info to solve Row B. I know, but I keep hearing jump into the air.
[4254.55s -> 4261.99s]  And my fucking split personality brain is dancing right now. There's a part of my brain
[4261.99s -> 4265.83s]  that is doing like the swing. Like, oh, hey, spin around. Grab that person by the arm.
[4265.83s -> 4269.59s]  Go around. Like the tap dancing and shit. And then there's another part that's sitting
[4269.59s -> 4276.62s]  here trying to do math. There's two people sitting here right now.
[4276.62s -> 4279.90s]  One of them is having a great time dancing at some fucking wedding.
[4279.90s -> 4290.63s]  And the other one's playing a game on stream. I'm just ripped in half.
[4292.94s -> 4297.02s]  All right. So that means... So we got one, two, three, four. I had it last time.
[4301.83s -> 4310.50s]  B7... It can't be there. I mean, it could because that's one and then space two.
[4311.30s -> 4317.50s]  Stop. I have to stop. I have to get out. I have to leave the wedding.
[4317.50s -> 4320.46s]  All right. Come back to me. Come on. Like, back in.
[4321.42s -> 4324.38s]  Sit in here. I need both of you here. Not just one.
[4326.42s -> 4334.90s]  Together. I'm like Majin Boo. Just all of you get back in here
[4334.90s -> 4339.74s]  for like a couple minutes and then I promise you can just go back to what you were doing.
[4339.74s -> 4349.22s]  Okay. So this is one, two, three. One, two, three. Let's get rid of...
[4349.22s -> 4353.64s]  No, I don't know. Okay. This? No. We're here.
[4354.74s -> 4364.01s]  One, two, three, four. I just don't know which side this is on. It can't be this.
[4364.01s -> 4366.09s]  Okay. All right. Okay. All right. All right. Everything's fine.
[4366.97s -> 4376.60s]  See? He sat back down. So then that's three, one.
[4377.48s -> 4386.87s]  Now the question is, where's this other three? So this is the one.
[4388.42s -> 4394.23s]  Yeah. This could... Okay. There's your four, right? One, two, three, four.
[4394.23s -> 4401.46s]  One, two, three, four. Hold on. One, two, three, four.
[4401.46s -> 4403.94s]  I don't know that info. Pull that back for a second.
[4407.16s -> 4410.52s]  Two, three, four. One, two, three, four. I don't know that info.
[4411.16s -> 4423.34s]  Okay. That leaves us with one. I have it now.
[4427.78s -> 4431.06s]  Okay. All right. Go ahead. Go. You can go. You can go. You can go.
[4431.06s -> 4434.18s]  You can go. Are you sure? Yeah, you're fine.
[4434.18s -> 4437.64s]  Just if I need you again, I'll call you back. Really?
[4437.64s -> 4439.40s]  Yeah. Go on. Thanks, man.
[4439.40s -> 4441.40s]  Right. All right. Come here. You're not breaking it.
[4441.40s -> 4456.20s]  Thanks a lot, man. Go have fun.
[4456.20s -> 4461.62s]  Two, three. No, I fucked it up again.
[4462.26s -> 4465.46s]  I need you. Stop. Get back here. No. Get back in. Get back in.
[4466.02s -> 4468.42s]  Stop, stop, stop. Back, back, back, back. Get back in here.
[4468.42s -> 4471.05s]  This is going to be three. This is wrong.
[4472.18s -> 4475.64s]  This has to be three. This is incorrect.
[4475.64s -> 4483.11s]  You see what I'm talking about? What did I do again that was wrong?
[4483.11s -> 4487.29s]  Because see, this is what it was. This is impossible.
[4487.29s -> 4488.73s]  That's not possible, but that can't be right.
[4489.29s -> 4504.50s]  So this is just wrong. And the question is, where did it go wrong?
[4505.06s -> 4521.74s]  Where did it go so this is wrong? Let me just pull this back.
[4523.61s -> 4528.31s]  God damn it. Am I pretending?
[4528.31s -> 4530.07s]  No. I'm just tired.
[4531.45s -> 4541.30s]  It went wrong with D7, did it? I got fucking restarted again.
[4547.16s -> 4549.08s]  Every time I see it because blah.
[4552.76s -> 4555.24s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, right?
[4555.24s -> 4557.88s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[4557.88s -> 4559.72s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[4559.72s -> 4561.08s]  We have this because of this information.
[4561.08s -> 4572.63s]  That's all I have right now. That's what it was before.
[4573.94s -> 4577.16s]  So now this is where it goes off the rails for me every time.
[4577.16s -> 4579.64s]  And I don't know why. Sometimes, okay, I blow through
[4580.20s -> 4582.20s]  some of these and then some of them, I just get stuck.
[4582.84s -> 4587.00s]  So there's no, four has to be here.
[4587.00s -> 4588.76s]  It has to be one, two, three, four.
[4589.58s -> 4591.10s]  This is what it has to be.
[4594.49s -> 4596.41s]  This is as far as I got before it was just...
[4603.56s -> 4605.88s]  Now this is also, this is a one.
[4606.52s -> 4609.56s]  That's the middle one. There's one down here.
[4609.56s -> 4611.24s]  And then three is up here somewhere.
[4615.24s -> 4616.36s]  All right. Now three...
[4617.08s -> 4619.22s]  Wait, are you shitting me?
[4619.86s -> 4626.62s]  I think I just got it right there.
[4627.94s -> 4635.59s]  I think I just got it wrong.
[4636.15s -> 4646.22s]  Is it wrong? Why am I crossing out D5?
[4648.31s -> 4649.19s]  Because look, see?
[4650.63s -> 4654.15s]  It's three, because I think this is the one, right?
[4656.76s -> 4659.08s]  Otherwise, this can't be the three.
[4659.08s -> 4660.04s]  This can't be the last one.
[4660.04s -> 4661.08s]  This is the middle one.
[4661.08s -> 4663.08s]  D5 is getting crossed out because it's the one.
[4663.80s -> 4665.51s]  It could be the three.
[4665.51s -> 4669.43s]  But if no, if it's a three, one, two, three, one, one.
[4669.43s -> 4670.39s]  No, it can't be the three.
[4671.03s -> 4672.12s]  Three is above here.
[4674.81s -> 4677.37s]  One, two, three, because then there's a space, ones.
[4677.37s -> 4678.49s]  But I mean, I guess it could.
[4678.49s -> 4679.53s]  Yes, it could. It could.
[4680.33s -> 4684.34s]  Because then this would be this.
[4688.98s -> 4690.66s]  No, but that doesn't work either, see?
[4691.38s -> 4693.21s]  Because now it has to be here.
[4693.21s -> 4697.00s]  Which would then be one, which is impossible.
[4697.00s -> 4702.12s]  See what I'm saying?
[4702.12s -> 4712.34s]  Because if it's three, then one, then one.
[4712.34s -> 4713.46s]  So if it was like that,
[4714.10s -> 4716.68s]  then that would mean it would have to be either here or here.
[4717.24s -> 4718.52s]  And if it's here, no.
[4718.52s -> 4721.00s]  If it's here, you only got one, one.
[4721.00s -> 4721.80s]  You can't do two here.
[4735.69s -> 4736.57s]  It's probably this.
[4737.29s -> 4741.90s]  That's realistically, because then let's take a look.
[4746.04s -> 4747.56s]  That covers that.
[4747.56s -> 4748.52s]  Here's this row.
[4748.52s -> 4749.64s]  Let me just see what that looks like now.
[4750.20s -> 4759.14s]  Okay, that looks right.
[4762.79s -> 4763.43s]  Yeah, that's right.
[4763.43s -> 4764.55s]  Okay, we're good.
[4765.11s -> 4769.00s]  Fucking puzzle, man.
[4769.56s -> 4784.14s]  One, two, three, four.
[4784.86s -> 4787.64s]  One, two, one, two, three, four.
[4789.14s -> 4792.95s]  All right, now the question is,
[4793.99s -> 4794.87s]  is this where that way?
[4794.87s -> 4795.51s]  I don't know yet.
[4796.47s -> 4798.89s]  But this is five.
[4798.89s -> 4801.45s]  So one, two, three, four, five.
[4801.45s -> 4803.21s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[4803.21s -> 4810.42s]  Five, I believe is correct.
[4811.53s -> 4817.19s]  Which would be one, and then three, right?
[4817.83s -> 4821.96s]  Okay, and that ends this, and that ends that.
[4822.68s -> 4826.86s]  What's coming up next?
[4827.82s -> 4829.18s]  A cowboy bebop, apparently.
[4837.56s -> 4838.84s]  All right, now we can do this.
[4838.84s -> 4840.76s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[4841.48s -> 4849.93s]  Here's the four has to be right here.
[4849.93s -> 4852.33s]  It's a two.
[4852.97s -> 4862.92s]  All right, that's done.
[4863.48s -> 4864.12s]  This is done.
[4866.82s -> 4867.70s]  And here's the two.
[4869.34s -> 4870.54s]  And then here's the two.
[4872.06s -> 4874.34s]  Beautiful is the one.
[4874.98s -> 4876.02s]  All right, what the hell?
[4876.02s -> 4877.46s]  What animal is this?
[4877.46s -> 4878.42s]  That took a long time.
[4879.06s -> 4881.48s]  Oh, is it a rooster?
[4894.07s -> 4895.83s]  That was not a chicken.
[4895.83s -> 4896.47s]  It could have been.
[4898.39s -> 4899.03s]  All right, what we got?
[4901.11s -> 4902.71s]  Seven, eight, nine.
[4902.71s -> 4904.87s]  We can go, let's see, one.
[4904.87s -> 4907.19s]  So just by deducing it with our logical brains.
[4907.99s -> 4909.50s]  Let's just say one is here.
[4910.22s -> 4911.50s]  That's space one.
[4911.50s -> 4912.94s]  So let's mark this just for a second.
[4912.94s -> 4915.26s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[4916.22s -> 4919.40s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[4920.04s -> 4921.80s]  One, two, three, four.
[4922.52s -> 4924.92s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[4924.92s -> 4927.24s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[4928.20s -> 4932.18s]  Got big bits coming.
[4932.74s -> 4933.22s]  I missed it.
[4933.94s -> 4938.10s]  Oh, Jesus, Freudian weapon.
[4938.74s -> 4945.37s]  Freudian weapon has just earned the 50,000 bits badge.
[4948.38s -> 4949.74s]  50,000.
[4950.46s -> 4954.55s]  Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[4954.55s -> 4955.83s]  5,000 bits, Freudian.
[4955.83s -> 4956.63s]  Really appreciate it.
[4958.22s -> 4960.86s]  And thank you for the 50 fucking thousand.
[4961.50s -> 4963.48s]  This song is terrible.
[4963.48s -> 4964.04s]  Skip it.
[4964.04s -> 4965.88s]  All right, one guy and you get to be the one guy sometimes.
[4971.90s -> 4972.38s]  What is it?
[4972.38s -> 4973.50s]  The whiplash soundtrack?
[4973.50s -> 4974.46s]  What is this?
[4974.46s -> 4980.60s]  I don't know.
[4981.40s -> 4983.61s]  This is more whiplash.
[4992.28s -> 4993.00s]  I'm thinking whatever.
[4993.00s -> 4994.04s]  This is just jazz.
[4995.00s -> 5001.06s]  But thank you, Freudian, for your massive contributions to the stream.
[5004.42s -> 5005.46s]  That's a shitload of money.
[5005.46s -> 5007.78s]  I can never expect somebody to fucking pay me that much money.
[5007.78s -> 5008.28s]  Thank you.
[5017.96s -> 5019.32s]  Is this their influence?
[5019.88s -> 5025.02s]  So we get two somewhere in here.
[5025.66s -> 5031.93s]  Two, one, one, one, three, three.
[5031.93s -> 5033.05s]  So we got this blocked off.
[5033.05s -> 5033.85s]  This helps us a little.
[5033.85s -> 5034.81s]  One, two, three.
[5035.69s -> 5038.50s]  And then down here.
[5038.50s -> 5039.54s]  One, two, three.
[5040.50s -> 5041.30s]  All right.
[5041.30s -> 5042.66s]  That's all I have for now.
[5043.62s -> 5052.58s]  Two, two, two, one.
[5053.30s -> 5055.77s]  What else do I got here?
[5056.49s -> 5058.07s]  This is probably the one.
[5058.07s -> 5058.55s]  It is.
[5058.55s -> 5059.05s]  All right.
[5059.67s -> 5061.03s]  Well, there's the next way, that two.
[5061.75s -> 5064.78s]  Which then brings us to three.
[5065.02s -> 5065.58s]  And then two.
[5065.58s -> 5066.06s]  There it is.
[5066.78s -> 5070.34s]  So we got three and three again.
[5070.34s -> 5071.46s]  One, two, three.
[5071.46s -> 5072.10s]  Space.
[5074.14s -> 5074.62s]  Yeah.
[5074.62s -> 5075.34s]  One, two, three.
[5075.34s -> 5075.66s]  Space.
[5075.66s -> 5076.38s]  One, two, three.
[5078.68s -> 5079.72s]  This is an animal again.
[5089.08s -> 5089.80s]  We got two.
[5090.60s -> 5092.44s]  Two fucked it up again.
[5092.44s -> 5093.48s]  He fucked it up again.
[5108.47s -> 5109.19s]  Fucked it up again.
[5109.75s -> 5123.40s]  What did I do?
[5124.84s -> 5126.20s]  It's right here somewhere.
[5126.20s -> 5126.68s]  Let me think.
[5127.48s -> 5129.62s]  I went too fast.
[5129.62s -> 5134.52s]  So this is one, three, two.
[5135.16s -> 5139.90s]  So hold on a minute here.
[5139.90s -> 5140.46s]  This can't...
[5143.35s -> 5144.63s]  No, this is fucked up.
[5169.48s -> 5169.72s]  No.
[5170.62s -> 5171.58s]  What am I missing?
[5171.58s -> 5173.26s]  I've got to go backwards again.
[5173.98s -> 5183.29s]  Let me see.
[5187.62s -> 5188.34s]  Bye.
[5188.34s -> 5188.66s]  Okay.
[5188.66s -> 5188.98s]  Hold on.
[5188.98s -> 5189.62s]  What happened there?
[5190.26s -> 5193.91s]  One.
[5193.91s -> 5197.45s]  Right, this is wrong.
[5198.17s -> 5206.92s]  One.
[5206.92s -> 5207.64s]  Is this...
[5207.64s -> 5208.20s]  This is still...
[5208.20s -> 5208.76s]  I don't think this is...
[5208.76s -> 5209.96s]  This is not right.
[5209.96s -> 5210.84s]  This is wrong here.
[5217.94s -> 5218.42s]  No.
[5218.42s -> 5219.30s]  It's all fucked up.
[5221.50s -> 5223.34s]  I did something fucking stupid somewhere.
[5239.05s -> 5239.77s]  I have to do it again.
[5239.77s -> 5240.25s]  I have to go...
[5240.25s -> 5240.97s]  I got to reset it.
[5241.69s -> 5245.67s]  I just fucking peed my pants.
[5246.39s -> 5252.30s]  Let me start again.
[5252.86s -> 5254.31s]  All right.
[5254.31s -> 5255.19s]  I can't handle this.
[5257.59s -> 5259.51s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5263.61s -> 5264.49s]  One space.
[5266.38s -> 5268.86s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5268.86s -> 5271.10s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5272.22s -> 5272.62s]  One.
[5272.62s -> 5273.26s]  There it is.
[5273.26s -> 5273.66s]  All right.
[5273.66s -> 5274.62s]  Where did I go again?
[5275.50s -> 5286.86s]  Boomer needs a diaper.
[5287.66s -> 5289.80s]  I probably will after this.
[5290.36s -> 5294.36s]  Just hand it over to the 70-year-old lady
[5294.36s -> 5296.68s]  who comes into my olive garden at 11 a.m. every single day.
[5296.68s -> 5298.04s]  She solves these like they're nothing.
[5298.68s -> 5301.67s]  Well, I'm going to make that joke funnier
[5301.75s -> 5303.11s]  because that's probably...
[5303.11s -> 5305.83s]  She probably does it for seven hours a day every single day.
[5307.40s -> 5310.20s]  She's probably done every single Picross puzzle that has ever...
[5310.20s -> 5312.95s]  She's probably done 50,000 of them.
[5312.95s -> 5314.95s]  She's been doing that since she was like 52.
[5316.04s -> 5318.36s]  She's got two decades of fucking experience.
[5318.36s -> 5320.44s]  She may as well get signed to a fucking esports team.
[5325.27s -> 5326.23s]  Anyways, where were we?
[5326.23s -> 5326.55s]  One.
[5326.55s -> 5327.03s]  There it is.
[5334.06s -> 5335.58s]  Big brained grandma.
[5338.62s -> 5339.42s]  Okay.
[5339.42s -> 5340.14s]  This is done.
[5341.69s -> 5343.05s]  I went off the rails here somewhere.
[5343.05s -> 5343.93s]  Let's find out how.
[5346.14s -> 5347.66s]  This is probably not...
[5347.66s -> 5349.66s]  This might be the one or that might be part of the three.
[5349.66s -> 5350.38s]  No, it's not.
[5351.02s -> 5352.54s]  Got to fill it all in.
[5352.54s -> 5353.04s]  Okay.
[5353.42s -> 5354.28s]  One.
[5354.74s -> 5368.30s]  This has to be the one because this is one.
[5368.30s -> 5369.18s]  It has to be that.
[5388.31s -> 5388.81s]  So now...
[5389.75s -> 5392.07s]  Do I miss Boston?
[5392.07s -> 5393.75s]  Sometimes, yeah, depending.
[5399.83s -> 5401.59s]  How is C7 filled in?
[5403.61s -> 5405.85s]  Because, well, this is what I did.
[5406.65s -> 5408.33s]  So if it's seven space one,
[5409.05s -> 5411.21s]  then you have to assume that there's a one and there's a space.
[5411.21s -> 5413.77s]  So let's just say it's here.
[5414.57s -> 5416.47s]  There has to be a space here.
[5416.47s -> 5418.95s]  Therefore, the seven has to be somewhere in here.
[5420.09s -> 5422.57s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5422.57s -> 5424.73s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5425.29s -> 5436.30s]  So that's why this is filled right now.
[5436.30s -> 5437.10s]  Good, Jeremy.
[5437.10s -> 5437.82s]  Very good.
[5438.46s -> 5439.74s]  Yes, I used my brain.
[5443.08s -> 5443.72s]  So now...
[5443.72s -> 5444.92s]  All right, let me focus for a second.
[5447.34s -> 5448.70s]  Two, one.
[5448.70s -> 5450.06s]  And that looks pretty perfect, but...
[5451.21s -> 5451.93s]  Because I had the...
[5451.93s -> 5453.93s]  Last time it was two, I had the two filled in here.
[5455.11s -> 5456.15s]  And it's probably here.
[5461.93s -> 5463.37s]  What a smart lad.
[5472.98s -> 5474.66s]  Okay, I'm on the right track here.
[5474.66s -> 5475.06s]  So that's...
[5475.78s -> 5476.90s]  There's the two, yep.
[5476.90s -> 5478.34s]  So this is where I went wrong before.
[5487.21s -> 5487.85s]  Can't be here.
[5488.49s -> 5491.64s]  So this has to be over here.
[5496.82s -> 5501.94s]  So then this two is down here somewhere.
[5502.50s -> 5508.87s]  There it is.
[5509.93s -> 5512.57s]  And there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[5513.85s -> 5516.25s]  I finally got my brain around this one.
[5516.97s -> 5525.29s]  Don't know any of these yet.
[5525.29s -> 5526.57s]  So one, hold on, one.
[5531.32s -> 5532.68s]  One, two, three.
[5532.68s -> 5534.04s]  So one, two, three.
[5534.04s -> 5534.92s]  One, two, three.
[5535.64s -> 5538.73s]  The two is done.
[5538.73s -> 5539.45s]  There goes this route.
[5539.45s -> 5540.57s]  All right, let's get it.
[5540.57s -> 5541.29s]  Let's speed it up.
[5543.85s -> 5545.69s]  You guys have had lots of time to guess this one.
[5549.66s -> 5552.74s]  Two, there's the three.
[5557.18s -> 5559.18s]  But you haven't had any idea what the hell it is.
[5564.50s -> 5565.30s]  Two, two.
[5566.50s -> 5567.22s]  Two, one.
[5567.94s -> 5568.58s]  Three, three.
[5572.36s -> 5573.40s]  Two is there somewhere.
[5574.63s -> 5575.35s]  One, two.
[5577.45s -> 5578.25s]  All right.
[5578.25s -> 5579.21s]  Two, two.
[5579.21s -> 5580.49s]  One, two, two.
[5581.45s -> 5582.49s]  One, two, one, two.
[5584.60s -> 5585.48s]  One, two.
[5587.56s -> 5588.12s]  Two, two.
[5588.12s -> 5589.56s]  Two, one, two, one.
[5589.56s -> 5590.12s]  One, two.
[5591.42s -> 5592.14s]  Two, two, one.
[5595.21s -> 5597.13s]  It's going to be surprised Pikachu.
[5598.58s -> 5600.10s]  One, two, three, four.
[5600.10s -> 5601.22s]  One, two, three, four.
[5603.34s -> 5604.22s]  That does that.
[5604.22s -> 5605.02s]  See you later.
[5605.02s -> 5605.66s]  See you later.
[5606.46s -> 5607.10s]  See you later.
[5607.66s -> 5608.70s]  Okay, see you later.
[5611.56s -> 5613.32s]  And see you later.
[5613.32s -> 5613.80s]  Finally.
[5616.22s -> 5616.70s]  Finally.
[5616.70s -> 5618.14s]  This dope did it.
[5618.70s -> 5621.45s]  Here, play, keep talking and nobody explodes.
[5621.45s -> 5623.05s]  I actually own it for VR.
[5623.05s -> 5625.66s]  I'm going to wait till nobody wants to play.
[5626.22s -> 5628.71s]  Anybody get it?
[5629.35s -> 5630.15s]  There's a wolf.
[5630.15s -> 5635.80s]  I don't think anybody got it.
[5635.80s -> 5637.00s]  Yeah, but I do own it for VR.
[5637.88s -> 5638.84s]  You'll see it at some point.
[5645.98s -> 5647.50s]  Got some free filled in ones.
[5647.50s -> 5648.14s]  That's good.
[5648.86s -> 5655.59s]  Which leads us, that's two.
[5655.59s -> 5655.91s]  Okay.
[5657.53s -> 5659.05s]  That's five, one, five, two.
[5660.25s -> 5662.17s]  Two, one, one, two.
[5662.89s -> 5664.09s]  All right, what can we work with now?
[5664.89s -> 5670.28s]  Well, it has to be here.
[5672.82s -> 5674.34s]  And then that has to be there.
[5674.34s -> 5676.09s]  Good to know.
[5676.73s -> 5678.10s]  That's also part of a one.
[5678.90s -> 5681.78s]  This is three.
[5681.78s -> 5683.06s]  That's a one, four, one.
[5687.48s -> 5688.92s]  Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[5688.92s -> 5689.88s]  Not quite.
[5689.88s -> 5690.92s]  Not quite.
[5690.92s -> 5694.89s]  Two, two, one.
[5694.89s -> 5695.53s]  I don't know.
[5696.25s -> 5697.46s]  I don't know any of these yet.
[5698.10s -> 5699.35s]  That one's empty.
[5708.22s -> 5709.50s]  Five, this is part of five.
[5709.50s -> 5710.94s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[5711.74s -> 5713.18s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[5713.18s -> 5713.42s]  Okay.
[5714.46s -> 5716.07s]  Three, that's part of the four.
[5716.07s -> 5717.19s]  That's part of the two.
[5717.19s -> 5719.03s]  That's part of the three, I'm going to assume.
[5719.83s -> 5723.75s]  No, no, music.
[5723.75s -> 5724.23s]  Right, right, right.
[5724.23s -> 5724.71s]  Sorry, sorry.
[5724.71s -> 5725.11s]  My bad.
[5725.75s -> 5733.91s]  I apologize already.
[5744.81s -> 5745.61s]  Right, Megan?
[5745.61s -> 5746.41s]  Yeah!
[5746.41s -> 5748.97s]  You say that just once you'd like your hamburger hot
[5748.97s -> 5751.13s]  and your lettuce and tomato cool and crisp
[5751.13s -> 5752.57s]  all at the same time.
[5752.57s -> 5753.29s]  Yeah!
[5753.29s -> 5755.13s]  Well, I say you got it.
[5755.13s -> 5757.69s]  I'm talking McDonald's and lettuce and tomato hamburger.
[5757.69s -> 5758.73s]  The McDLT.
[5759.77s -> 5762.25s]  I'm talking quarter pound of beef on the hot, hot side.
[5763.53s -> 5764.33s]  Stays hot.
[5764.33s -> 5766.01s]  The new McDLT.
[5766.01s -> 5766.65s]  Hot, hot.
[5766.65s -> 5768.89s]  Less lettuce and tomato on the cool, cool side.
[5770.17s -> 5770.97s]  Stays cool.
[5770.97s -> 5772.41s]  The new McDLT.
[5773.37s -> 5774.65s]  The cool stays hot.
[5774.65s -> 5776.01s]  The cool stays crisp.
[5776.01s -> 5776.89s]  Put it together.
[5776.89s -> 5778.33s]  You can't resist.
[5778.33s -> 5779.45s]  The hottest taste.
[5779.45s -> 5780.81s]  The coolest crunch.
[5780.81s -> 5781.61s]  Hot, hot.
[5781.61s -> 5782.89s]  Keep it cool, cool.
[5782.89s -> 5784.17s]  McDLT.
[5784.17s -> 5785.29s]  McDLT.
[5785.29s -> 5786.49s]  Hot beefy McD.
[5786.49s -> 5787.61s]  Cool, crisp, L-T.
[5787.61s -> 5788.17s]  McD.
[5788.89s -> 5789.85s]  L-T.
[5789.85s -> 5791.13s]  It's a good time.
[5791.13s -> 5792.25s]  Hot beefy McD.
[5792.25s -> 5793.45s]  With a great taste.
[5793.45s -> 5794.57s]  Cool, crisp, L-T.
[5794.57s -> 5795.53s]  At McDonald's!
[5813.24s -> 5815.24s]  Okay.
[5815.24s -> 5823.18s]  So I gotta mark the ones.
[5823.74s -> 5826.54s]  Which there are a couple that I didn't do, right?
[5831.61s -> 5835.61s]  This is the three.
[5836.33s -> 5838.87s]  Because it's not one, two, three.
[5842.12s -> 5844.44s]  So it's probably one, two, three, or one, two, three.
[5845.72s -> 5848.90s]  Can we go back to McDonald's?
[5855.90s -> 5856.46s]  No.
[5856.46s -> 5867.06s]  Three is?
[5867.06s -> 5873.00s]  Hope you have a nice relaxing Friday afternoon.
[5873.00s -> 5874.34s]  What's today's date?
[5875.66s -> 5876.70s]  Friday night.
[5876.70s -> 5879.51s]  I'm your master of ceremonies.
[5879.51s -> 5880.23s]  German on eight, five.
[5880.95s -> 5887.43s]  Dylan Jacobs.
[5887.99s -> 5892.58s]  Grew up in the southernmost port of Mississippi.
[5893.54s -> 5899.64s]  Learned to play the guitar when he was eight years old.
[5902.52s -> 5903.88s]  Gonna have a selection for you here.
[5904.44s -> 5906.18s]  Her it is.
[5907.16s -> 5908.92s]  Mom makes a really mean apple pie.
[5910.76s -> 5911.88s]  Be in the studio shortly.
[5912.44s -> 5913.24s]  With us tonight.
[5913.80s -> 5924.06s]  But first I gotta get done with this P-Cross level.
[5924.06s -> 5934.74s]  All right, where am I going?
[5934.74s -> 5935.46s]  Here, here, here.
[5937.50s -> 5937.98s]  P-Cross?
[5937.98s -> 5938.78s]  It is P-Cross.
[5940.36s -> 5941.24s]  It's P-Cross.
[5943.66s -> 5945.74s]  Two, two, four, one, four.
[5955.64s -> 5964.14s]  One, one, two, one, two, three, two, one.
[5965.10s -> 5967.03s]  What the hell is this?
[5967.19s -> 5967.67s]  Floral?
[5968.39s -> 5976.26s]  All right, I gotta slow down because I'm feeling I'm in
[5977.30s -> 5978.34s]  at a kind of insane pace.
[5978.34s -> 5978.74s]  I need to...
[5981.64s -> 5983.88s]  And then what an insane pace he's going at.
[5983.88s -> 5988.20s]  Slowly hover his head over and press that one.
[5988.20s -> 5989.56s]  I'm going at an insane pace.
[5990.52s -> 5994.36s]  What did you say before?
[5994.36s -> 5995.40s]  Like Arby's grandma?
[6003.66s -> 6004.30s]  No.
[6004.30s -> 6006.86s]  I solved all the ten...
[6006.86s -> 6007.42s]  Is that eggs?
[6008.14s -> 6012.38s]  How did you get daisies?
[6012.38s -> 6014.06s]  Five, six of you got daisies right.
[6017.11s -> 6017.43s]  All right.
[6018.23s -> 6019.19s]  15 by 15.
[6019.19s -> 6020.15s]  These are gonna take a while.
[6025.75s -> 6027.43s]  13, 14, 15, therefore two.
[6028.15s -> 6043.32s]  No, I don't know that yet.
[6043.32s -> 6047.64s]  One, let's just cover these up.
[6051.03s -> 6052.07s]  That felt pretty good.
[6052.07s -> 6053.03s]  This is empty now.
[6053.75s -> 6055.58s]  What song am I playing?
[6055.58s -> 6059.18s]  This is background chill-out music.
[6059.18s -> 6061.98s]  Music for relaxed study, work, relaxing jazz music.
[6062.95s -> 6064.23s]  There's a coffee cup on the counter.
[6070.22s -> 6071.10s]  Resident sleeper.
[6071.10s -> 6072.70s]  Well, just relax.
[6073.34s -> 6075.69s]  What have you got going on today?
[6077.75s -> 6080.63s]  If you have something to do, somewhere to go,
[6080.63s -> 6082.55s]  or maybe if you got nowhere to be at all.
[6083.19s -> 6086.71s]  But if you are going out, skip it.
[6086.71s -> 6087.19s]  Stay here.
[6088.76s -> 6090.52s]  Watch your 33-year-old moron
[6092.01s -> 6094.81s]  try to complete 80-year-old Arby's grandmother's puzzles.
[6115.24s -> 6116.52s]  Olive Garden, not Arby's.
[6116.52s -> 6117.72s]  Why do I keep saying Arby's?
[6120.01s -> 6122.33s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[6122.97s -> 6126.23s]  Reminds me of a story.
[6126.79s -> 6134.98s]  I'm not going to tell a story.
[6134.98s -> 6136.26s]  No, don't.
[6136.26s -> 6136.82s]  Who cares?
[6142.79s -> 6149.80s]  There's lots of ones here.
[6150.44s -> 6156.20s]  There's your three.
[6156.20s -> 6157.16s]  There's your second three.
[6158.26s -> 6160.02s]  And there's, is that, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6163.38s -> 6164.10s]  Start-up top.
[6165.77s -> 6166.25s]  Six.
[6166.25s -> 6167.29s]  These are all six.
[6167.29s -> 6167.77s]  All of them.
[6171.69s -> 6172.49s]  Nice.
[6172.49s -> 6176.58s]  All right, what about the bottom here?
[6176.58s -> 6178.94s]  We've got five, one.
[6179.74s -> 6181.29s]  This one.
[6181.29s -> 6182.57s]  That row's done, okay.
[6183.78s -> 6186.50s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[6186.50s -> 6189.85s]  It's full.
[6189.85s -> 6190.65s]  That's full.
[6190.65s -> 6190.97s]  Full.
[6192.62s -> 6194.14s]  Three ones.
[6195.02s -> 6196.94s]  That's a seven.
[6197.96s -> 6199.24s]  Three and then the one.
[6199.24s -> 6200.52s]  This is all full already.
[6200.52s -> 6200.84s]  Seven.
[6201.80s -> 6202.76s]  This is a computer.
[6204.63s -> 6206.55s]  Some form of computer, guys.
[6206.55s -> 6212.44s]  There's seven in here.
[6213.00s -> 6215.26s]  That looks pretty done to me.
[6216.89s -> 6218.01s]  And it does.
[6219.05s -> 6222.54s]  Oh, it's a floppy!
[6222.54s -> 6223.04s]  Floppy!
[6227.48s -> 6227.98s]  Nice.
[6228.36s -> 6233.88s]  This one's already done for me.
[6233.88s -> 6235.48s]  I didn't even vote a baby level.
[6236.47s -> 6237.59s]  15 by 15.
[6237.59s -> 6240.31s]  You sure it's not like eight by six?
[6242.60s -> 6244.76s]  Well, I even have this as a 15 by 15 level.
[6249.29s -> 6251.69s]  All right, so we have six here.
[6251.69s -> 6253.69s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[6254.66s -> 6257.35s]  I mean, it can just be this whole fucking thing.
[6257.35s -> 6267.59s]  Any more sixes?
[6267.59s -> 6268.39s]  There are.
[6268.39s -> 6272.26s]  Any more sixes?
[6273.13s -> 6274.01s]  Or high numbers?
[6274.65s -> 6278.18s]  What about one, two, three, four?
[6278.18s -> 6278.58s]  Damn it.
[6283.66s -> 6284.70s]  This stream is boring.
[6294.01s -> 6296.97s]  Well, I'm sorry that you think that.
[6296.97s -> 6297.61s]  But it is.
[6300.98s -> 6302.34s]  This is not what I wanted to do tonight.
[6302.98s -> 6304.18s]  I kind of got fucking screwed.
[6304.74s -> 6308.20s]  My Dreamcast overheated and exploded.
[6311.61s -> 6313.93s]  And I wasn't able to play the Dreamcast thing that I wanted to do.
[6318.49s -> 6319.77s]  We're just relaxing.
[6319.77s -> 6324.90s]  I'll probably call it here in like an hour.
[6324.90s -> 6329.51s]  What am I doing tomorrow?
[6330.07s -> 6339.21s]  Tomorrow, I think I'm healthy enough to do VR again.
[6339.21s -> 6340.81s]  I'm pretty sure I'm good to go.
[6340.81s -> 6345.83s]  The last couple of days, I really wanted to just not do it.
[6346.39s -> 6351.53s]  I have like another four or five VR experiences I want to do.
[6351.53s -> 6354.98s]  So expect Minecraft VR.
[6354.98s -> 6356.26s]  Yes, it's going to happen.
[6356.82s -> 6359.18s]  Minecraft VR is going to be tomorrow.
[6359.18s -> 6362.54s]  And probably a handful of other things.
[6362.54s -> 6364.14s]  And I can't fucking believe.
[6364.38s -> 6365.58s]  Here's the worst part about that.
[6365.58s -> 6371.67s]  That stream will probably have the highest view count of any stream I've done in the last year.
[6371.67s -> 6374.39s]  Last time I played Minecraft for like an hour,
[6374.39s -> 6379.78s]  my view count went up by like a thousand to two thousand people.
[6379.78s -> 6382.86s]  I don't know why, but it's okay.
[6382.86s -> 6383.42s]  It's all good.
[6384.54s -> 6385.66s]  Over ten thousand?
[6385.66s -> 6388.60s]  No, I don't think so.
[6388.60s -> 6390.84s]  I would be surprised if that stream had that many.
[6390.84s -> 6396.22s]  No way.
[6396.22s -> 6398.14s]  But that's what we're going to do tomorrow.
[6398.14s -> 6401.03s]  I'm definitely healthy enough again to do it.
[6401.03s -> 6405.08s]  But for now, we're just chilling out.
[6405.08s -> 6407.16s]  Just playing this little pick-ross game.
[6407.16s -> 6413.45s]  We're dialing it back a little.
[6413.45s -> 6415.93s]  And we'll get back to it tomorrow.
[6415.93s -> 6417.85s]  If you got somewhere to be, if you got somewhere to go,
[6417.85s -> 6420.97s]  or if you think it's boring, then we'll see tomorrow.
[6420.97s -> 6421.69s]  You know, it's okay.
[6422.25s -> 6425.66s]  Not every stream has to be fucking crazy.
[6425.66s -> 6427.18s]  You know, sometimes you just paint a picture
[6427.18s -> 6430.38s]  and do it very slowly because you're bad.
[6431.02s -> 6437.14s]  But with that being said, let's go.
[6437.14s -> 6437.94s]  Let's just keep playing.
[6438.50s -> 6444.12s]  Whatever the music.
[6449.58s -> 6451.82s]  He's picking out all the one negative comments.
[6451.82s -> 6454.38s]  Yeah, but I want to be, let's be real about it.
[6454.38s -> 6456.70s]  I'm playing pick-ross.
[6458.94s -> 6460.22s]  When I told everybody like,
[6460.22s -> 6462.30s]  Space Channel 5 tonight, guys.
[6462.30s -> 6463.02s]  Space Channel 5.
[6463.02s -> 6463.74s]  You already, oh yeah.
[6463.74s -> 6464.38s]  Choo, choo.
[6464.38s -> 6465.02s]  Can't wait.
[6465.02s -> 6470.36s]  That makes sense.
[6470.36s -> 6473.66s]  So this is one, one, yeah.
[6473.66s -> 6483.34s]  This is the two.
[6483.34s -> 6486.22s]  Also one, also one.
[6486.22s -> 6499.05s]  But yeah, VR will be tomorrow.
[6499.05s -> 6512.71s]  Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[6512.71s -> 6513.27s]  It's not enough.
[6514.95s -> 6516.07s]  Is there a derma discord?
[6516.07s -> 6517.11s]  There is.
[6517.11s -> 6518.60s]  It's open to the public.
[6519.24s -> 6521.00s]  There are a couple of sub-only.
[6521.00s -> 6523.00s]  Well, there's only one sub-only room, actually.
[6532.30s -> 6533.02s]  I can't make it tomorrow.
[6533.02s -> 6533.74s]  Will you cancel it?
[6534.30s -> 6534.80s]  No.
[6535.66s -> 6538.07s]  It's not going to be a long stream.
[6538.07s -> 6540.15s]  All my VR streams are less than four or five hours.
[6540.71s -> 6544.86s]  So it's okay.
[6544.86s -> 6545.82s]  You go, you can, you catch it.
[6546.46s -> 6550.07s]  It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[6550.07s -> 6552.15s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[6557.85s -> 6558.81s]  Now we got some info.
[6565.72s -> 6566.52s]  Mike, no.
[6566.52s -> 6567.96s]  Okay, this is part of the three then.
[6572.55s -> 6572.95s]  Three.
[6573.91s -> 6575.03s]  Which way?
[6575.59s -> 6578.73s]  Well, it's definitely not here.
[6579.45s -> 6582.89s]  Two, three, four, five.
[6582.89s -> 6584.49s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[6584.49s -> 6584.99s]  No.
[6585.63s -> 6588.70s]  To the stream again tomorrow, another day.
[6590.96s -> 6593.04s]  Just put aside five hours.
[6593.04s -> 6595.68s]  Yeah, and I can't, I can't expect everybody to make every stream.
[6601.21s -> 6606.49s]  What kind of psycho would I have to be to assume that everybody is going to be at the stream
[6607.79s -> 6611.95s]  for five, four, five, six, seven plus hours?
[6611.95s -> 6614.92s]  You know, people have shit to do.
[6615.56s -> 6618.76s]  Got, you know, some people got places to be, things to do.
[6618.76s -> 6621.74s]  That's a lot.
[6621.74s -> 6624.22s]  Like, there's a commitment to sit here for, you know, eight hours.
[6625.53s -> 6628.09s]  Some of you, like a lot of you guys stick around for a long time.
[6628.73s -> 6637.12s]  So this is the one then.
[6637.12s -> 6643.26s]  However long you stay, that's, I'm fucking happy you came.
[6643.26s -> 6654.14s]  Okay, two, there's three.
[6661.64s -> 6662.68s]  All right, getting somewhere.
[6665.71s -> 6667.23s]  Three, cover that.
[6669.90s -> 6672.06s]  So let's see what happens here.
[6679.95s -> 6680.51s]  One, two.
[6682.44s -> 6684.04s]  No, I just, I don't know that info yet.
[6688.46s -> 6690.22s]  Where bots were not actually here.
[6690.22s -> 6696.30s]  Oh yeah, I see 2,800 unique IPs.
[6696.86s -> 6700.33s]  That's not true.
[6700.33s -> 6701.37s]  I don't have that information.
[6703.13s -> 6704.01s]  One, two, three.
[6712.09s -> 6713.61s]  One, two, three, sit one, two.
[6713.61s -> 6714.57s]  All right, let's go right there.
[6715.45s -> 6719.20s]  Doesn't really help that much.
[6720.56s -> 6721.20s]  No, not really.
[6724.81s -> 6727.37s]  We're special bots, so we get our own IPs.
[6731.04s -> 6733.04s]  Are you pulling, are you pulling my leg here?
[6733.68s -> 6734.56s]  I think you might be.
[6735.95s -> 6741.12s]  God, some of you guys just tell tall tales.
[6744.40s -> 6745.52s]  One, two, there's four.
[6745.52s -> 6748.72s]  So one, two, three, four.
[6748.72s -> 6750.00s]  No, this might be that one.
[6750.72s -> 6757.64s]  We're either here or we're here.
[6758.28s -> 6758.92s]  No way to tell.
[6760.04s -> 6768.94s]  Shit, a lot of ones.
[6781.24s -> 6783.24s]  Modest Narcissist, 10 community subs.
[6783.88s -> 6787.34s]  Thanks a lot.
[6787.34s -> 6790.54s]  10 more community subs on top of all the other ones.
[6790.54s -> 6791.90s]  And all the fucking money.
[6795.44s -> 6796.32s]  Thank you.
[6796.32s -> 6800.38s]  I'm kind of stuck here.
[6800.38s -> 6801.66s]  One of these I know can be filled in.
[6803.71s -> 6804.99s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[6804.99s -> 6806.83s]  One, two, three.
[6809.05s -> 6811.13s]  It's probably there, but it could be here too.
[6811.85s -> 6824.14s]  Okay, I just got it.
[6824.14s -> 6824.54s]  I got it.
[6825.64s -> 6827.00s]  All right, I just had to look at it first.
[6827.00s -> 6827.56s]  Okay, good, good, good.
[6827.56s -> 6828.52s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[6829.85s -> 6832.41s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[6832.41s -> 6834.33s]  Block that out and go.
[6834.33s -> 6836.01s]  Good, get rid of this.
[6836.01s -> 6837.29s]  There's the two, there's the six.
[6838.67s -> 6839.47s]  One, two.
[6840.68s -> 6842.84s]  Oh, it's just wonderful.
[6844.49s -> 6845.21s]  That one's done.
[6846.17s -> 6847.61s]  Two, three.
[6848.41s -> 6851.85s]  All you need, it's cascades once you get one.
[6851.85s -> 6854.09s]  Once you fill in, you see it, your mind locks in.
[6854.65s -> 6856.17s]  And then bingo, the whole thing gets filled in.
[6856.73s -> 6858.94s]  That's two leaves us one.
[6859.50s -> 6859.98s]  One more.
[6861.44s -> 6862.40s]  It's probably up here.
[6863.04s -> 6866.54s]  There's one, two, three, four, five.
[6867.10s -> 6868.00s]  There's another one.
[6868.88s -> 6870.48s]  All ones across the board.
[6871.04s -> 6873.68s]  Now let's see here.
[6873.68s -> 6874.48s]  This is a three.
[6883.92s -> 6886.48s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6886.48s -> 6887.04s]  He blew it.
[6890.78s -> 6891.26s]  He blew it.
[6891.90s -> 6893.63s]  You had it and you blew it.
[6901.31s -> 6904.86s]  Because look now, this is only, I blew it.
[6904.86s -> 6911.72s]  Look, this is not part of the three.
[6911.72s -> 6913.40s]  It's one, one, three, two.
[6926.84s -> 6927.16s]  Shit.
[6927.98s -> 6929.66s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[6932.57s -> 6933.77s]  No, this is the one that was given.
[6935.29s -> 6936.73s]  So this, this has to be here.
[6937.37s -> 6948.80s]  Let me just keep troubleshooting this.
[6948.80s -> 6952.62s]  Because that's done.
[6952.62s -> 6953.26s]  This is done.
[6953.98s -> 6966.80s]  Let me see here.
[6981.76s -> 6983.28s]  Guess snail.
[6985.82s -> 6992.91s]  It's, yeah, it's definitely a snail.
[6992.91s -> 7005.39s]  Let me see if I can just draw the picture now.
[7005.39s -> 7005.95s]  It's here.
[7007.64s -> 7008.28s]  Okay.
[7008.28s -> 7010.62s]  One, two.
[7011.77s -> 7012.25s]  I'll get it.
[7054.65s -> 7056.99s]  No, no.
[7057.63s -> 7061.36s]  What happened here?
[7061.36s -> 7062.40s]  Where's the one here?
[7062.40s -> 7064.40s]  Here?
[7064.40s -> 7065.04s]  It's done.
[7065.04s -> 7065.92s]  It's so close.
[7065.92s -> 7066.96s]  Which is incorrect.
[7066.96s -> 7067.68s]  Here?
[7067.68s -> 7077.72s]  Fuck.
[7077.72s -> 7080.20s]  One, two, one.
[7080.20s -> 7085.72s]  No, this is not right.
[7085.72s -> 7109.58s]  Oh, one, one, I'm not seeing one thing.
[7144.91s -> 7146.11s]  I screwed it up.
[7146.11s -> 7147.07s]  I can't.
[7147.07s -> 7147.63s]  You do it.
[7147.63s -> 7148.59s]  You guys do it.
[7148.59s -> 7149.47s]  You guys do it.
[7149.47s -> 7150.73s]  You do it.
[7150.73s -> 7151.21s]  You do it.
[7151.21s -> 7152.73s]  I'm too fucked up right now.
[7152.73s -> 7153.53s]  You do it.
[7153.53s -> 7156.51s]  I just do it.
[7156.51s -> 7156.99s]  Just do it.
[7156.99s -> 7157.71s]  Somebody do it.
[7158.27s -> 7158.83s]  Somebody do it.
[7158.83s -> 7159.95s]  I'm going to close all these out.
[7159.95s -> 7160.59s]  Somebody do it.
[7164.14s -> 7165.18s]  You're not going to fill A.
[7165.18s -> 7165.66s]  No, no.
[7165.66s -> 7166.54s]  Somebody do it.
[7166.54s -> 7167.26s]  Somebody get it.
[7167.26s -> 7168.38s]  I'll, somebody do it.
[7177.44s -> 7178.64s]  Clear G5.
[7178.64s -> 7179.12s]  You got it.
[7184.27s -> 7185.39s]  I'm just done.
[7186.65s -> 7188.97s]  My brain is fucking scrambled toast.
[7190.51s -> 7191.79s]  And fill in G4.
[7192.81s -> 7193.13s]  Okay.
[7195.34s -> 7197.02s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[7200.30s -> 7201.34s]  I'm not picking that one.
[7201.34s -> 7204.75s]  G5, L4.
[7205.55s -> 7206.03s]  Okay.
[7206.03s -> 7207.39s]  Looking good so far.
[7207.95s -> 7210.75s]  You guys are fucking bailing me out here.
[7210.75s -> 7211.15s]  Thank you.
[7214.80s -> 7215.84s]  Remove L4.
[7215.84s -> 7216.24s]  It's gone.
[7221.28s -> 7222.08s]  It's working.
[7222.08s -> 7222.88s]  It's working.
[7224.68s -> 7226.36s]  And fill in L6.
[7226.36s -> 7227.88s]  Oh, thank goodness, you guys.
[7227.88s -> 7228.28s]  Thank you.
[7235.76s -> 7244.30s]  Well, congratulations, whoever guessed snail.
[7244.30s -> 7245.66s]  I'm telling you, it's music.
[7247.45s -> 7249.45s]  You guys wonder, why does he not have a playlist on?
[7249.93s -> 7252.91s]  I can't, I can't focus on anything going on.
[7253.71s -> 7258.24s]  Why does he not listen to music?
[7258.24s -> 7258.72s]  I can't.
[7259.93s -> 7262.01s]  Unless I'm like locked in a room.
[7262.01s -> 7267.12s]  This is one, two, three.
[7267.12s -> 7267.76s]  Any zeros?
[7268.40s -> 7274.33s]  Let's see.
[7274.33s -> 7277.69s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[7277.69s -> 7279.05s]  No, it's not quite correct.
[7279.77s -> 7290.28s]  All right, this is music.
[7290.84s -> 7297.64s]  Okay, so one, two, three.
[7297.64s -> 7298.60s]  One, two, three.
[7298.60s -> 7300.04s]  The rest of this is garbage.
[7300.76s -> 7301.82s]  Get rid of it.
[7302.38s -> 7309.16s]  Can you put on my mixtape?
[7310.64s -> 7310.96s]  Maybe.
[7311.60s -> 7312.32s]  Depends on what it is.
[7312.88s -> 7314.40s]  This is one, one, two.
[7314.40s -> 7314.88s]  Let's see.
[7314.88s -> 7317.76s]  So we got two, one, one, one.
[7317.76s -> 7318.88s]  Two, one, one, one.
[7320.81s -> 7321.93s]  One, two.
[7322.49s -> 7326.94s]  Put on the rat's mixtape.
[7330.24s -> 7331.60s]  Well, there's five.
[7331.60s -> 7332.40s]  Let's see.
[7332.40s -> 7335.12s]  One, two, three, four, five, one.
[7335.12s -> 7336.72s]  Okay, so divide all this.
[7339.68s -> 7341.44s]  What the hell else do we have here?
[7341.44s -> 7341.84s]  Three.
[7343.88s -> 7344.52s]  Got to be here.
[7344.52s -> 7345.24s]  There's your seven.
[7347.50s -> 7348.54s]  Lightning on the gentleman.
[7350.78s -> 7351.50s]  Lots of ones.
[7353.24s -> 7353.96s]  There's the three.
[7353.96s -> 7355.08s]  Fill this rest of it in.
[7355.90s -> 7356.94s]  This is gone now, too.
[7357.82s -> 7359.26s]  So is this, and so is this.
[7359.98s -> 7361.85s]  And just that one up.
[7361.85s -> 7362.65s]  Cover that here.
[7363.61s -> 7367.74s]  What happened to Jerma's audio software stream?
[7368.60s -> 7369.88s]  Yeah, I know.
[7370.60s -> 7372.20s]  Too many ideas.
[7373.00s -> 7374.49s]  They're all gonna happen.
[7375.13s -> 7379.55s]  Did you see the Jerma is a liar video?
[7380.35s -> 7381.44s]  I did.
[7382.08s -> 7390.49s]  Play it again.
[7391.61s -> 7399.16s]  One.
[7399.16s -> 7403.66s]  This is two, one.
[7406.27s -> 7406.91s]  Filled in.
[7406.91s -> 7407.79s]  What is this music?
[7407.79s -> 7412.14s]  Is this a boomerang?
[7412.14s -> 7416.46s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[7417.26s -> 7423.96s]  Two.
[7424.84s -> 7425.16s]  Cool.
[7425.96s -> 7427.16s]  That's the rest of the eleven.
[7432.52s -> 7435.48s]  One, one, one, three.
[7440.27s -> 7441.95s]  That is a three here, too.
[7441.95s -> 7444.11s]  One, two, three, one, two, three.
[7444.11s -> 7451.02s]  We got four.
[7451.66s -> 7452.38s]  And then a one.
[7452.38s -> 7454.62s]  We got one, three.
[7454.62s -> 7457.29s]  Where's that four at?
[7457.29s -> 7457.85s]  Right there.
[7458.49s -> 7460.08s]  And then right here.
[7460.08s -> 7460.88s]  What is it?
[7460.88s -> 7461.20s]  Comb?
[7466.16s -> 7466.96s]  Oh, music, right.
[7466.96s -> 7468.16s]  It's a pan flute.
[7468.80s -> 7470.32s]  Hey, nice job, guys.
[7470.96s -> 7478.30s]  Hey, Jerma, thanks for these streams.
[7478.30s -> 7480.22s]  I can get through horror games more easily.
[7481.93s -> 7482.41s]  Yeah.
[7482.41s -> 7483.21s]  Hell yeah.
[7483.21s -> 7486.01s]  Don't get too scared.
[7486.01s -> 7487.37s]  Remember, it's not real.
[7487.37s -> 7508.48s]  Okay.
[7508.48s -> 7509.44s]  Got seven.
[7512.48s -> 7513.28s]  This is four.
[7515.58s -> 7516.22s]  Seven.
[7516.22s -> 7518.70s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[7518.70s -> 7520.62s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[7522.00s -> 7522.80s]  Can't do anything else.
[7523.36s -> 7527.32s]  This is gonna be hard.
[7528.04s -> 7530.12s]  I really appreciate these quiet streams
[7530.12s -> 7532.28s]  since I can be the one guy more often.
[7532.28s -> 7532.52s]  Yeah.
[7537.56s -> 7537.96s]  Don't worry.
[7537.96s -> 7539.88s]  Tomorrow is very, very...
[7539.88s -> 7543.53s]  It's rared up to be really loud and tense.
[7545.85s -> 7547.37s]  There'll be a loud one tomorrow.
[7547.37s -> 7547.85s]  You'll see.
[7554.14s -> 7555.10s]  So one.
[7555.10s -> 7559.79s]  Let's go with one, two, three, four, five.
[7559.79s -> 7561.55s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[7561.55s -> 7568.17s]  So now we can figure this out, right?
[7568.73s -> 7570.51s]  Because it can't be up there.
[7570.51s -> 7572.43s]  So it's gonna be one, two, three, four, five.
[7572.99s -> 7574.80s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[7577.21s -> 7580.25s]  One, two, three, four, space, two.
[7580.81s -> 7582.01s]  And got it.
[7582.01s -> 7589.37s]  No, I don't.
[7589.45s -> 7590.01s]  I don't know.
[7590.01s -> 7591.14s]  That's wrong.
[7594.28s -> 7595.08s]  What can I do with this?
[7596.36s -> 7597.48s]  Seven, two.
[7601.71s -> 7603.31s]  Well, there's a four here somewhere,
[7603.31s -> 7605.23s]  but I don't know where because I don't have any more blocks.
[7608.43s -> 7609.79s]  None of these can be figured out.
[7609.79s -> 7610.59s]  It's too little of them.
[7613.02s -> 7613.74s]  Dermabate.
[7616.35s -> 7619.15s]  I'm making you mental by not using the middle mouse button.
[7620.78s -> 7621.34s]  Yeah, I know.
[7621.90s -> 7624.94s]  It's just different play styles, you know?
[7644.78s -> 7646.14s]  Three, four, one, two.
[7646.14s -> 7647.58s]  So that has to be there.
[7647.58s -> 7648.30s]  There's the five.
[7654.08s -> 7655.36s]  Five can only be down, yeah?
[7656.00s -> 7656.32s]  Yep.
[7658.68s -> 7660.44s]  Now that hell unlocks this,
[7662.35s -> 7667.63s]  which in turn lets us determine that you got one, two, three, four.
[7667.63s -> 7669.87s]  Yes, I can do one, two, three, four.
[7669.87s -> 7675.72s]  Therefore, what about this one?
[7675.72s -> 7676.36s]  Three.
[7676.36s -> 7677.96s]  You can do one, two, three.
[7677.96s -> 7679.00s]  One, two, three, there.
[7679.00s -> 7679.50s]  Four.
[7681.12s -> 7682.16s]  Closing in on this one.
[7682.16s -> 7682.56s]  Let's see.
[7683.20s -> 7692.09s]  Still trying to...
[7692.09s -> 7693.37s]  This is four, two.
[7696.28s -> 7697.24s]  Just which way does this...
[7697.24s -> 7699.56s]  Because if this is here, right?
[7699.56s -> 7701.55s]  Say that's one, two, three, four.
[7702.70s -> 7704.38s]  Then it has to be either here.
[7705.66s -> 7706.16s]  No.
[7706.86s -> 7707.58s]  No.
[7707.58s -> 7710.83s]  But if it's here, then it has to be here.
[7710.83s -> 7712.27s]  So I don't have enough info.
[7722.94s -> 7724.46s]  Dermabate wants to play RuneScape?
[7728.88s -> 7732.48s]  I mean, I've never played it.
[7733.12s -> 7740.25s]  I can do something with this knowing that the six is down here though.
[7740.89s -> 7742.64s]  Let's see.
[7743.44s -> 7746.68s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[7749.10s -> 7750.22s]  So knowing that...
[7750.22s -> 7752.30s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[7752.86s -> 7754.94s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[7755.90s -> 7757.53s]  All right.
[7757.53s -> 7758.33s]  What does that lead us?
[7764.20s -> 7766.60s]  So that gives a few...
[7768.04s -> 7775.57s]  Bingo.
[7776.11s -> 7781.24s]  And all you got to do is unlock one.
[7784.52s -> 7789.37s]  The whole thing starts to complete itself.
[7794.09s -> 7796.09s]  Now this can go down.
[7796.09s -> 7796.33s]  All right.
[7796.33s -> 7798.25s]  Let's go one, two, three, four.
[7798.25s -> 7799.92s]  Or one, two, three, four.
[7802.81s -> 7807.32s]  So not enough info.
[7807.32s -> 7808.44s]  Yes, there is.
[7808.44s -> 7811.37s]  Because of that new line I just made.
[7812.17s -> 7814.40s]  Oh, that's some good cider, yeah?
[7815.12s -> 7817.44s]  I wish I had a cider right now.
[7817.52s -> 7819.52s]  I'd just be hanging out, sipping it.
[7820.08s -> 7823.37s]  So let's see.
[7823.37s -> 7824.49s]  That's done.
[7824.49s -> 7830.52s]  There's no way to know that.
[7830.52s -> 7833.16s]  Well, there's no way it's there.
[7833.16s -> 7835.08s]  So one, two, three, one, two, three.
[7835.08s -> 7835.80s]  Not enough info.
[7841.23s -> 7844.19s]  I mean, it really wants to be right here, doesn't it?
[7861.50s -> 7867.15s]  Five, two, and this is one.
[7867.15s -> 7868.83s]  One, two, three, cross that.
[7869.55s -> 7873.30s]  Okay.
[7876.28s -> 7877.80s]  Too much info on the screen for me.
[7877.80s -> 7879.80s]  Even though it's more desirable, I know.
[7880.68s -> 7895.56s]  Was this an accessory?
[7896.20s -> 7900.27s]  What kind of accessory is this?
[7903.20s -> 7904.24s]  So it's not here.
[7905.04s -> 7905.84s]  It's none of these.
[7905.84s -> 7906.72s]  It's not this one either.
[7907.52s -> 7909.21s]  Good to know.
[7914.57s -> 7915.61s]  It's Shito.
[7918.27s -> 7920.46s]  It is Shito.
[7920.46s -> 7921.66s]  I wonder if it's going to be yellow.
[7922.22s -> 7938.19s]  Shito.
[7938.19s -> 7939.31s]  No, it is a pipe.
[7940.03s -> 7943.24s]  Did we already do this one?
[7943.24s -> 7947.05s]  I feel like we did that one already last time.
[7947.05s -> 7948.83s]  Maybe not.
[7948.83s -> 7950.92s]  Hold on.
[7950.92s -> 7951.48s]  Let me take a look.
[7954.40s -> 7956.24s]  Yeah, we did do that one last time.
[7956.24s -> 7956.96s]  I was wondering.
[7956.96s -> 7957.92s]  See, look, we did it.
[7957.92s -> 7961.44s]  Remember mustache, watermelon.
[7961.44s -> 7962.48s]  This is where we left off.
[7965.12s -> 7966.32s]  This is tools.
[7966.32s -> 7967.76s]  Also 15 by 15.
[7967.76s -> 7971.64s]  This one looks interesting.
[7972.20s -> 7982.08s]  13, 14, 5, 8, 15.
[7982.08s -> 7983.36s]  So we can do this row.
[7983.36s -> 7990.84s]  So it's a tool.
[7991.48s -> 7995.56s]  And there are no zeros this time.
[7995.56s -> 7996.06s]  No.
[7996.44s -> 7997.72s]  No help this time.
[7997.72s -> 8004.43s]  13, did that.
[8004.99s -> 8008.35s]  All right.
[8008.35s -> 8009.71s]  Any more that I guarantee?
[8009.71s -> 8010.11s]  Let's see.
[8010.11s -> 8013.21s]  That's 3, 6, 12, 13, 14.
[8013.21s -> 8013.71s]  No.
[8013.93s -> 8024.35s]  7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[8032.80s -> 8034.72s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[8036.49s -> 8037.13s]  Not quite.
[8037.13s -> 8038.09s]  I need to get something else here.
[8038.09s -> 8038.73s]  Some more data.
[8041.32s -> 8043.16s]  But let's cancel this stuff out over here.
[8043.80s -> 8049.21s]  So all these down here.
[8051.45s -> 8057.38s]  Okay.
[8058.25s -> 8059.45s]  Again, same thing with this one.
[8064.88s -> 8065.36s]  Any more?
[8065.36s -> 8066.08s]  That's a 1.
[8066.08s -> 8066.88s]  That's a 1.
[8066.88s -> 8067.68s]  That's a 7.
[8069.04s -> 8069.68s]  That's a...
[8070.56s -> 8071.84s]  I can do this one now, can't I?
[8071.84s -> 8074.72s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[8078.01s -> 8081.13s]  5, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[8081.13s -> 8081.77s]  Nah, I can't.
[8090.84s -> 8092.36s]  Guys, get some pretty good guesses so far.
[8094.91s -> 8095.39s]  Who knows?
[8099.68s -> 8100.24s]  All right.
[8100.24s -> 8101.68s]  7, 1, 1.
[8105.55s -> 8107.31s]  Well, it has to be this way.
[8107.31s -> 8109.23s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8109.23s -> 8109.71s]  There it is.
[8112.19s -> 8113.55s]  Maybe give us some more info.
[8116.94s -> 8117.66s]  There's 2.
[8117.66s -> 8118.86s]  Cross this whole thing out.
[8119.50s -> 8124.24s]  Is that 4?
[8125.60s -> 8126.16s]  3.
[8126.16s -> 8127.52s]  It's got to be here, right?
[8128.32s -> 8132.97s]  Yeah, because 1, 2, 3, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[8132.97s -> 8133.69s]  Yeah, that's it.
[8134.81s -> 8135.61s]  Is that done?
[8136.41s -> 8137.13s]  Well, row gone.
[8142.86s -> 8143.58s]  13.
[8143.58s -> 8143.98s]  Close it.
[8143.98s -> 8144.54s]  14.
[8144.54s -> 8145.02s]  Close it.
[8145.58s -> 8145.98s]  Close it.
[8147.61s -> 8148.41s]  Nice.
[8148.41s -> 8149.13s]  There's the 5.
[8153.88s -> 8156.04s]  This is a really weird looking tool.
[8156.76s -> 8161.28s]  It's got an umbrella.
[8162.38s -> 8164.38s]  This actually could be an umbrella, maybe.
[8173.20s -> 8175.04s]  A fairly busted umbrella.
[8175.04s -> 8196.49s]  Let's not do that yet.
[8196.49s -> 8206.73s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[8209.66s -> 8210.30s]  There we go.
[8218.70s -> 8219.50s]  4 somewhere.
[8219.50s -> 8220.62s]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[8224.89s -> 8225.45s]  1.
[8225.45s -> 8226.09s]  Yep.
[8226.09s -> 8227.21s]  All right.
[8227.21s -> 8227.77s]  What are that?
[8227.77s -> 8228.81s]  Any more info?
[8232.16s -> 8237.05s]  What the hell is this tool?
[8237.61s -> 8252.94s]  Looks like a wine opener.
[8257.60s -> 8260.32s]  1, 4, right?
[8260.32s -> 8262.00s]  I mean, it has to be.
[8262.00s -> 8266.19s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8267.15s -> 8267.55s]  Don't know.
[8268.11s -> 8269.56s]  Could be anything.
[8271.95s -> 8273.95s]  5, 4, 1, 1.
[8273.95s -> 8274.75s]  There's your 1.
[8275.55s -> 8278.43s]  3, 1.
[8279.23s -> 8279.79s]  That's done.
[8281.56s -> 8282.60s]  Do I have this incorrect?
[8282.60s -> 8283.80s]  This looks completely wrong.
[8284.52s -> 8292.12s]  Doesn't this look completely incorrect?
[8292.84s -> 8301.21s]  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8302.33s -> 8311.71s]  2, 1 is the 2.
[8315.15s -> 8315.95s]  All right.
[8315.95s -> 8316.51s]  Almost done.
[8317.31s -> 8330.30s]  4 somewhere in here.
[8332.35s -> 8332.91s]  3.
[8332.91s -> 8334.03s]  No, the 1 is there.
[8334.83s -> 8336.11s]  This is the 2.
[8336.83s -> 8341.88s]  This is the end of that.
[8349.20s -> 8350.41s]  8.
[8350.41s -> 8352.16s]  Done.
[8352.16s -> 8352.96s]  3.
[8352.96s -> 8359.74s]  So now I have to consider where the 6 is.
[8359.74s -> 8361.26s]  Because that's 3.
[8361.26s -> 8362.94s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[8363.90s -> 8364.86s]  Space.
[8364.86s -> 8365.66s]  1, 2, 3.
[8365.66s -> 8366.30s]  No, not quite.
[8367.10s -> 8377.32s]  That's done.
[8377.32s -> 8378.75s]  That makes things a little easier.
[8380.48s -> 8382.00s]  Because then, yeah.
[8383.26s -> 8383.82s]  Cool.
[8383.82s -> 8392.57s]  Is this a hammer?
[8393.05s -> 8394.09s]  That's clearly a hammer.
[8407.76s -> 8414.43s]  It's somebody holding a hammer.
[8414.43s -> 8419.58s]  Well, nice job.
[8419.58s -> 8421.18s]  Got another easy one here.
[8421.18s -> 8422.38s]  What time is it?
[8422.38s -> 8423.42s]  It's been about 5 hours.
[8424.06s -> 8426.25s]  I'll keep going.
[8426.25s -> 8427.13s]  I'm good to go.
[8427.13s -> 8428.09s]  Probably like a little while.
[8436.46s -> 8437.34s]  I think this is done already.
[8437.98s -> 8440.94s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[8440.94s -> 8441.42s]  I live it is.
[8446.67s -> 8447.47s]  Play some music?
[8448.27s -> 8450.03s]  I got one right now.
[8451.53s -> 8452.81s]  I like this is very, very...
[8453.53s -> 8454.49s]  It sits in the background.
[8455.52s -> 8456.72s]  It's not causing any problems.
[8459.58s -> 8461.42s]  My two halves can sit together.
[8462.06s -> 8465.40s]  I like this for now.
[8468.78s -> 8470.46s]  Yeah, it's pretty good coffee shop music.
[8470.46s -> 8472.06s]  This is really good weather channel music.
[8473.92s -> 8475.20s]  You know, while you sit there and watch
[8475.20s -> 8476.56s]  to see if your school got canceled.
[8481.12s -> 8484.16s]  Where are we?
[8484.16s -> 8487.34s]  1, 5, 6, 7, no.
[8489.00s -> 8490.04s]  But I can do this.
[8492.49s -> 8495.24s]  Because, I mean, if it's here,
[8495.24s -> 8496.36s]  let's just do that.
[8496.36s -> 8497.88s]  Because then it has to be space.
[8497.88s -> 8499.80s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8500.44s -> 8502.96s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8503.68s -> 8505.70s]  Okay.
[8509.05s -> 8510.17s]  Dude, school got canceled?
[8510.17s -> 8510.81s]  Are you serious?
[8511.61s -> 8513.90s]  I used to love that.
[8513.90s -> 8514.86s]  It was the best thing ever.
[8516.48s -> 8519.20s]  Nothing could compare to when you got up
[8519.20s -> 8520.72s]  on a snow-filled day.
[8521.36s -> 8522.48s]  Looked out the window.
[8522.48s -> 8524.24s]  Saw that there was a shitload of snow outside
[8524.24s -> 8525.68s]  and you're like, there's no way I'm going to school.
[8526.32s -> 8531.15s]  Somebody tells you, no school.
[8531.15s -> 8532.91s]  And you go, I cannot wait.
[8532.91s -> 8534.11s]  That's perfect.
[8534.11s -> 8535.47s]  Go outside for like 40 minutes.
[8536.11s -> 8540.12s]  Come back in and play Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
[8540.12s -> 8541.80s]  Turtles in Time all day.
[8542.44s -> 8546.12s]  What a day.
[8548.40s -> 8550.00s]  That's zero, zero.
[8550.00s -> 8554.25s]  This is also part of seven.
[8554.89s -> 8556.88s]  Well, wait a minute, hold on.
[8556.88s -> 8558.16s]  Can I just do this now?
[8558.16s -> 8559.69s]  No, not yet.
[8559.69s -> 8563.34s]  This might be the three.
[8563.34s -> 8568.46s]  This is the end of the four.
[8569.50s -> 8572.38s]  So let's just say 1, 2, 3, 4.
[8573.10s -> 8573.84s]  Right?
[8574.78s -> 8576.35s]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[8577.07s -> 8587.20s]  Those days were awesome,
[8587.20s -> 8588.32s]  but I'll never forget that day we were
[8590.20s -> 8592.92s]  the only school in the valley that didn't have
[8592.92s -> 8594.12s]  their school closed for weather.
[8596.52s -> 8597.24s]  Yeah, that sucked.
[8597.88s -> 8604.43s]  When you were certain that school was going to get canceled
[8604.43s -> 8605.31s]  and then no, it did not.
[8605.31s -> 8606.03s]  You had to go to school.
[8606.03s -> 8608.83s]  Or like a two hour delay, a one hour delay.
[8609.47s -> 8612.27s]  That was worse than just going to school
[8612.27s -> 8615.20s]  because then that sinking feeling in your gut.
[8616.62s -> 8618.30s]  Oh, there's a foot of snow on the ground.
[8619.20s -> 8620.00s]  One hour delay.
[8631.08s -> 8634.04s]  I would rather than add an hour to the top of school
[8634.76s -> 8637.00s]  than let me come in an hour late on a school day,
[8637.00s -> 8637.64s]  on a snow day.
[8641.28s -> 8642.32s]  That sucks.
[8642.32s -> 8644.91s]  All right, let's focus here.
[8644.91s -> 8645.55s]  So this is the two.
[8646.19s -> 8653.87s]  I don't know if this is the one or the three.
[8653.87s -> 8655.23s]  This is part of the seven.
[8655.23s -> 8655.71s]  So let's see.
[8655.71s -> 8656.91s]  I closed that down a little.
[8656.91s -> 8657.63s]  This could be the one.
[8658.64s -> 8660.80s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8660.80s -> 8662.72s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8662.72s -> 8664.80s]  Not much more info I can go on there though.
[8668.04s -> 8669.56s]  This is the one.
[8670.28s -> 8671.40s]  And let's let's see how one.
[8672.12s -> 8674.84s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8674.84s -> 8675.34s]  No.
[8675.80s -> 8678.03s]  I don't know what to tell.
[8678.03s -> 8678.53s]  Not yet.
[8685.32s -> 8691.34s]  2, 7, 2, 1.
[8691.98s -> 8692.38s]  Let's see.
[8692.38s -> 8699.12s]  1, 7, and 1 could be down here.
[8699.92s -> 8705.21s]  Which means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8705.21s -> 8707.77s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[8708.99s -> 8709.49s]  Awesome.
[8710.03s -> 8714.73s]  Does that do anything for me?
[8715.61s -> 8716.73s]  I don't think it does.
[8718.38s -> 8719.50s]  Unless this is a one.
[8719.50s -> 8720.30s]  No, it is.
[8720.30s -> 8721.34s]  So this is going to help here.
[8727.36s -> 8728.16s]  Whenever we had a delay,
[8728.16s -> 8731.12s]  my mom just called in to say it was too icy where we lived.
[8732.08s -> 8735.61s]  Fucking that's a 300 IQ mom play right there.
[8739.64s -> 8739.96s]  All right.
[8739.96s -> 8742.04s]  So let's just say that this is the four here.
[8742.04s -> 8745.74s]  So let's say that this is the one.
[8745.74s -> 8749.55s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[8749.55s -> 8752.67s]  All right, nice.
[8752.67s -> 8755.88s]  It's clearly the four.
[8756.60s -> 8762.22s]  For a 75 IQ kid?
[8764.43s -> 8765.71s]  How do you know that?
[8765.71s -> 8766.91s]  You don't have that information.
[8766.91s -> 8767.47s]  What do you mean?
[8768.11s -> 8769.53s]  Was that you?
[8769.53s -> 8770.89s]  Wait, who did you write?
[8770.89s -> 8772.09s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8772.65s -> 8786.19s]  Did I just read maybe their best friends?
[8787.71s -> 8788.75s]  No, no.
[8788.75s -> 8790.11s]  How would you know that if it wasn't?
[8790.11s -> 8792.51s]  Did somebody somebody find that?
[8793.36s -> 8795.79s]  I they're friends.
[8795.79s -> 8799.64s]  Oh, you're right.
[8799.64s -> 8799.96s]  You're right.
[8799.96s -> 8800.76s]  That could be possible.
[8818.56s -> 8820.08s]  How did you not figure that out?
[8821.80s -> 8823.08s]  I don't know because who knows?
[8825.16s -> 8826.28s]  This is the three here.
[8826.84s -> 8827.64s]  I figured that out.
[8827.64s -> 8828.76s]  So I was three.
[8828.76s -> 8837.37s]  All right.
[8837.37s -> 8838.81s]  This is an animal.
[8838.81s -> 8840.72s]  We're all friends.
[8840.72s -> 8842.16s]  We all have the same IQ.
[8842.72s -> 8856.24s]  I'm going to assume it's these two are both filled in.
[8857.28s -> 8859.52s]  In that case, then it would be aye, aye, aye.
[8860.80s -> 8866.68s]  Hold on.
[8866.68s -> 8868.88s]  This is five.
[8870.84s -> 8873.00s]  So one, two, three, five.
[8873.00s -> 8874.52s]  So that goes up this shit.
[8875.48s -> 8878.99s]  So then same thing with this.
[8879.71s -> 8895.37s]  Get rid of this nonsense, which in turn move those out of the way now.
[8896.25s -> 8898.67s]  Fuck.
[8898.67s -> 8908.41s]  There's another one over here.
[8908.41s -> 8909.69s]  Let's just say it's right there.
[8910.89s -> 8915.74s]  Combine our IQs together.
[8917.21s -> 8918.97s]  Me dumber since I start watching.
[8923.08s -> 8924.52s]  You're probably smarter.
[8924.52s -> 8925.96s]  You just feel dumber.
[8925.96s -> 8938.08s]  I think that helps here.
[8943.92s -> 8950.36s]  Yes, progress has been made.
[8950.36s -> 8951.00s]  I did it.
[8951.00s -> 8952.28s]  I clicked one.
[8952.28s -> 8962.59s]  Actually might be a rat.
[8963.23s -> 8966.48s]  So then the three is over here somewhere.
[8994.28s -> 8995.32s]  Wait, that's down there.
[8995.96s -> 8998.33s]  Yeah, that's the only place that can be.
[8998.97s -> 9004.35s]  I mean, it could be here, but then that would be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[9004.99s -> 9005.71s]  No, I don't know.
[9005.71s -> 9007.07s]  I can't tell if that's down there or not.
[9024.40s -> 9024.64s]  Fuck.
[9028.14s -> 9031.71s]  Well, this is obviously a two has to be back here.
[9031.71s -> 9032.59s]  So it's not this.
[9033.15s -> 9033.87s]  Oh, okay.
[9033.87s -> 9034.91s]  I just helped myself there.
[9037.68s -> 9038.16s]  That helps.
[9039.04s -> 9040.00s]  How much does that give me?
[9040.56s -> 9046.12s]  Enough.
[9046.68s -> 9051.08s]  Oh, perfect.
[9051.08s -> 9051.96s]  Okay, cool.
[9051.96s -> 9053.90s]  So this is seven now.
[9053.90s -> 9054.54s]  Fill that in.
[9055.10s -> 9057.02s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[9057.90s -> 9059.32s]  One is somewhere over there.
[9060.04s -> 9061.80s]  Ten is filled in.
[9061.80s -> 9062.44s]  There you go.
[9066.59s -> 9068.59s]  Five could be anywhere right now.
[9082.81s -> 9085.34s]  Seven, start on two, three.
[9086.46s -> 9091.02s]  Well, I just threw that one completely under the bus for everybody that thought this was a rat.
[9094.40s -> 9096.88s]  It is absolutely not a rat.
[9096.88s -> 9098.88s]  It's very, it's a rat with a tall head.
[9109.20s -> 9110.08s]  Looks incorrect.
[9110.72s -> 9122.30s]  No, I can stay.
[9127.82s -> 9133.26s]  So, hey, look, perfect opportunity for a one.
[9135.36s -> 9136.56s]  What the hell is this?
[9137.28s -> 9140.49s]  Is this a bird?
[9141.29s -> 9159.50s]  I have no idea.
[9159.50s -> 9173.61s]  Well, let's just say, what the hell is that?
[9174.17s -> 9176.24s]  Four is somewhere here.
[9176.24s -> 9177.12s]  I need to figure this out.
[9184.48s -> 9185.52s]  Could be here though.
[9185.52s -> 9185.92s]  It could.
[9199.12s -> 9199.44s]  What?
[9206.75s -> 9207.71s]  Why is this down here?
[9209.74s -> 9212.22s]  It shouldn't have a detached leg.
[9223.72s -> 9224.36s]  Is this poo?
[9224.36s -> 9225.08s]  It's not poo.
[9225.64s -> 9229.96s]  Four, three.
[9231.85s -> 9232.89s]  This can be filled in.
[9232.89s -> 9233.53s]  No, it can't.
[9234.09s -> 9242.92s]  I think it has to, this one of these has to be here.
[9243.48s -> 9250.46s]  Because if, let's just say it's, if you got one, two, three, four, get a space,
[9251.34s -> 9256.08s]  which leads to one, two, three, or one, two, three.
[9256.08s -> 9257.20s]  It has to be there, I think.
[9257.84s -> 9260.36s]  I'm not certain though.
[9260.36s -> 9261.32s]  I'm going to keep that there.
[9262.12s -> 9269.29s]  That's not right.
[9271.85s -> 9283.52s]  What animal is this?
[9286.73s -> 9287.45s]  Yeah, I had it right.
[9300.41s -> 9301.29s]  I am stumped.
[9301.29s -> 9303.77s]  I don't know what, what this could remotely could be.
[9305.21s -> 9306.17s]  Is this the head over here?
[9306.17s -> 9307.37s]  Or is this the head here?
[9307.37s -> 9308.33s]  Or is the head down here?
[9308.33s -> 9309.21s]  Is it like curled up?
[9313.16s -> 9314.52s]  No, it is the two.
[9315.16s -> 9321.88s]  Okay, I still haven't figured that part out though.
[9322.44s -> 9331.68s]  It's done.
[9331.68s -> 9332.18s]  All right.
[9343.31s -> 9345.15s]  Is it a, it's probably a rooster probably.
[9346.19s -> 9346.99s]  Kangaroo?
[9346.99s -> 9347.49s]  Maybe.
[9348.05s -> 9368.22s]  This one's tricky though, because I can't, I just kind of need to, what is it?
[9371.33s -> 9375.47s]  It's a seagull!
[9375.47s -> 9381.49s]  Wow, four people got that.
[9381.49s -> 9392.90s]  Nice job.
[9392.90s -> 9400.85s]  Stream has been saved.
[9400.85s -> 9405.25s]  12, 13, 14, 15, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[9405.25s -> 9411.09s]  Let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
[9413.18s -> 9417.09s]  Okay, same thing here.
[9417.09s -> 9423.68s]  11, 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[9436.26s -> 9436.98s]  Nobody saw that.
[9440.67s -> 9441.47s]  Zero IQ.
[9442.82s -> 9443.70s]  Nobody saw that.
[9444.34s -> 9448.32s]  That's 11.
[9449.04s -> 9452.67s]  So this is 12 down.
[9452.67s -> 9453.79s]  That's eight, nine, 10, 11.
[9454.75s -> 9462.05s]  He's got a fucking beef brain.
[9463.68s -> 9464.80s]  Well, that's the one.
[9464.80s -> 9465.30s]  Sure.
[9466.13s -> 9466.93s]  Let's continue down.
[9467.97s -> 9469.41s]  Six, three, seven.
[9469.41s -> 9470.77s]  Any more that I can do?
[9471.49s -> 9474.35s]  Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
[9474.35s -> 9475.07s]  It's not 12.
[9475.71s -> 9476.64s]  So close.
[9484.88s -> 9485.68s]  This is a toy.
[9486.64s -> 9490.06s]  Three, go like this.
[9490.70s -> 9495.68s]  Let's see how much we can get here.
[9495.68s -> 9499.52s]  And it's one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five.
[9500.64s -> 9504.82s]  Okay, anything else?
[9504.82s -> 9505.86s]  That's the one.
[9505.86s -> 9507.14s]  No, no more info there.
[9507.70s -> 9509.06s]  Six, we can do some of this.
[9513.87s -> 9515.79s]  Three, again, we can go like this.
[9518.42s -> 9519.54s]  Two is even better.
[9524.99s -> 9529.09s]  Seven, three, four, five, six, seven.
[9531.66s -> 9534.06s]  Okay, let's get to work.
[9534.78s -> 9551.47s]  Back to be two, one.
[9556.51s -> 9557.23s]  Rufor is wrong.
[9557.95s -> 9558.99s]  What do you mean?
[9561.50s -> 9565.92s]  Oh, I thought for some reason I thought it was the only the...
[9565.92s -> 9566.80s]  Yeah, I'm stupid.
[9568.67s -> 9570.03s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9570.03s -> 9570.99s]  That's true, that's true, that's true.
[9572.00s -> 9573.60s]  Because look, there has to be a two in here.
[9574.74s -> 9575.86s]  Yeah, no, that's correct.
[9575.86s -> 9576.50s]  I had it right.
[9577.06s -> 9577.78s]  Just not this one.
[9586.72s -> 9587.68s]  The eight and the two.
[9587.68s -> 9588.16s]  What do you mean?
[9590.48s -> 9591.68s]  Other Xs.
[9591.68s -> 9592.48s]  This is row four.
[9595.02s -> 9595.90s]  This is the one here.
[9599.84s -> 9602.56s]  I mean, I guess technically you're right.
[9603.20s -> 9605.60s]  This could be the three, right?
[9605.60s -> 9607.20s]  Technically that you could be right.
[9610.67s -> 9611.31s]  No, I'll leave it.
[9611.87s -> 9619.71s]  All right, let's get started.
[9620.27s -> 9623.92s]  No two there.
[9626.29s -> 9628.21s]  Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[9628.21s -> 9631.49s]  Three, six, three, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[9640.91s -> 9641.71s]  Four is to work with.
[9647.82s -> 9648.46s]  There's the two.
[9649.02s -> 9652.93s]  There's a two in here somewhere.
[9652.93s -> 9653.73s]  There's the 11.
[9663.26s -> 9664.22s]  Two and then two.
[9665.26s -> 9666.14s]  I'll take a look at that.
[9666.86s -> 9667.50s]  Found them.
[9667.50s -> 9668.22s]  Found that two.
[9670.18s -> 9671.70s]  And then seven, nice.
[9672.58s -> 9675.65s]  Which then leads us to two.
[9675.65s -> 9676.93s]  Cover, cover, cover, cover.
[9677.81s -> 9681.07s]  Now this is great because look at this.
[9681.71s -> 9683.50s]  Say goodbye to everything up here.
[9683.50s -> 9684.22s]  Everything up here.
[9684.22s -> 9684.94s]  Everything up here.
[9685.50s -> 9686.38s]  Not quite up here.
[9689.31s -> 9689.95s]  It's just row.
[9696.13s -> 9696.85s]  This game does not.
[9696.85s -> 9698.13s]  I don't think this game has an OST.
[9698.13s -> 9699.01s]  I'm pretty sure it doesn't.
[9700.88s -> 9703.76s]  It just has one song that plays some way over and over again.
[9707.01s -> 9714.58s]  All right, so this is definitely one, two, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[9715.62s -> 9717.34s]  This is part of the three.
[9721.26s -> 9724.50s]  Five, one, one, two.
[9724.50s -> 9725.38s]  No, I can do this now.
[9726.02s -> 9733.71s]  Five, two, two, three, six, nice.
[9738.06s -> 9742.56s]  Three, four, gone.
[9743.20s -> 9747.71s]  This could go either way for a little while.
[9748.91s -> 9751.63s]  There's two.
[9751.63s -> 9753.23s]  So then one, two, three.
[9753.23s -> 9754.43s]  Got to be right in the middle there.
[9754.43s -> 9755.63s]  And it has to be right there.
[9755.63s -> 9756.03s]  Thank you.
[9759.12s -> 9762.61s]  Eight, you got to connect these.
[9763.57s -> 9765.58s]  Fill in the three.
[9766.30s -> 9774.45s]  Where does that lead?
[9775.01s -> 9780.72s]  That's two, one, two, three, one, two, three.
[9781.52s -> 9785.55s]  I wish I had this one earlier.
[9789.90s -> 9792.46s]  Six, one, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[9796.21s -> 9797.17s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9797.81s -> 9803.55s]  That leads to one, two, three, four, five.
[9804.35s -> 9806.34s]  This is a toy.
[9806.34s -> 9807.38s]  I know what this is.
[9807.38s -> 9818.42s]  All right, this should be fairly self-explanatory now.
[9819.38s -> 9827.79s]  And then the four, and then the eight.
[9829.81s -> 9830.53s]  Rubber Duckie.
[9832.24s -> 9834.24s]  Congratulations to those of you that guessed it correct.
[9837.33s -> 9838.61s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[9838.61s -> 9839.49s]  A lot of you guys said boat.
[9842.30s -> 9844.94s]  Yeah, it looked a lot like a boat when we first started it.
[9846.24s -> 9846.96s]  Bath Duck.
[9849.50s -> 9850.86s]  Nobody says bath duck.
[9856.45s -> 9859.09s]  Bath Duck sounds like a Russian translation.
[9860.78s -> 9862.30s]  It's bath duck.
[9862.30s -> 9866.42s]  Let's see.
[9866.98s -> 9872.53s]  So this is 15 by 15, but it's actually not.
[9876.22s -> 9882.99s]  That's 14 across not quite what we're looking for.
[9882.99s -> 9887.95s]  I'll find a good one here.
[9890.32s -> 9891.44s]  I can still do it though.
[9891.44s -> 9893.44s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[9894.00s -> 9897.22s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[9897.94s -> 9901.70s]  So let's just assume that this is in the middle.
[9903.06s -> 9905.06s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[9905.06s -> 9905.70s]  I can do these.
[9906.74s -> 9913.15s]  And then over here, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[9914.03s -> 9918.43s]  So that's one, two, three, four, five, six.
[9918.99s -> 9920.59s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[9921.31s -> 9922.51s]  I can get that done at least.
[9935.41s -> 9936.13s]  Is that far enough?
[9938.56s -> 9938.88s]  It is.
[9939.60s -> 9940.69s]  There's our six.
[9941.33s -> 9946.53s]  This is a food.
[9947.84s -> 9948.16s]  Food.
[9949.70s -> 9958.62s]  Knowing that, that's all I know at the moment.
[9958.62s -> 9959.98s]  Except this could be the...
[9959.98s -> 9961.66s]  This might be the two or the four.
[9961.66s -> 9962.54s]  Could it be the four?
[9962.54s -> 9963.82s]  One, two, three, four.
[9964.78s -> 9965.18s]  Space.
[9970.70s -> 9971.18s]  Not the four.
[9971.18s -> 9971.90s]  This has to be the four.
[9972.94s -> 9982.59s]  Which leads...
[9982.59s -> 9985.62s]  That's seven, five, two, two.
[9986.66s -> 9989.49s]  Let's see.
[9990.21s -> 9995.12s]  Two.
[10001.86s -> 10004.05s]  Well, let's do this.
[10004.05s -> 10006.37s]  Let's narrow it down because I can do some of this.
[10007.09s -> 10015.92s]  Wish I had something over here.
[10015.92s -> 10018.48s]  Seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[10019.44s -> 10021.76s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[10021.76s -> 10025.23s]  I can at least get it kind of narrowed.
[10029.25s -> 10031.17s]  This is the janitor game from yesterday.
[10031.73s -> 10035.47s]  I know this is a little more involved than the janitor game.
[10035.47s -> 10036.11s]  I will say.
[10039.12s -> 10039.36s]  Shit.
[10039.92s -> 10051.63s]  I got this one, yeah.
[10052.35s -> 10061.14s]  Yeah, no five.
[10061.78s -> 10063.26s]  This is five, four.
[10063.26s -> 10064.46s]  So five, it has to be here.
[10065.34s -> 10067.28s]  So do I have enough?
[10067.28s -> 10069.12s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[10070.16s -> 10071.12s]  One, two, three, four.
[10071.12s -> 10072.59s]  Nope.
[10072.59s -> 10074.11s]  That's enough info to get the middle, though.
[10074.75s -> 10080.61s]  Because again, let's assume that it looks like this.
[10081.41s -> 10085.30s]  And just go like that.
[10086.26s -> 10087.38s]  And then go like this, right?
[10087.38s -> 10088.42s]  One, two, three, four.
[10088.42s -> 10089.62s]  One, two, three, four.
[10089.62s -> 10091.14s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[10091.78s -> 10092.99s]  One, two, three.
[10092.99s -> 10096.48s]  I mean, I'm just going to assume this.
[10100.32s -> 10102.88s]  Now this is interesting because this makes this the one.
[10104.00s -> 10105.92s]  Same thing over here, right?
[10105.92s -> 10106.64s]  No.
[10106.64s -> 10108.06s]  This makes this the three.
[10108.94s -> 10121.44s]  If that's the case, that would make this the six.
[10122.08s -> 10124.00s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[10124.00s -> 10125.20s]  Yeah, I would make this the six.
[10126.16s -> 10128.77s]  Whoops, and this is a two.
[10129.49s -> 10139.94s]  Let's see.
[10140.74s -> 10145.87s]  Three, four, five.
[10145.87s -> 10160.35s]  This is an outside source from music.
[10160.35s -> 10161.63s]  It's not from the game itself.
[10162.43s -> 10168.77s]  Why is everybody doing the oh my god face?
[10172.99s -> 10175.15s]  I'm seeing a lot of oh my oh no face.
[10175.95s -> 10176.91s]  Why, what's happening?
[10176.91s -> 10184.02s]  What's wrong?
[10184.02s -> 10185.14s]  Whoa, that like blinked.
[10185.78s -> 10192.05s]  This has to be five in a row.
[10195.94s -> 10196.90s]  Narrowing this down.
[10196.90s -> 10198.02s]  Can I even get one here?
[10202.11s -> 10202.59s]  Nice, okay.
[10202.59s -> 10203.39s]  At least I can get that.
[10204.11s -> 10206.83s]  So these are all two, two, two.
[10207.95s -> 10210.27s]  Again, we got, it could be here, here, here, here.
[10210.99s -> 10214.85s]  That means that this is empty, right?
[10214.85s -> 10216.82s]  It has to be, at least.
[10217.38s -> 10230.35s]  And then this is two, four, two, one, two, three, four.
[10230.35s -> 10230.99s]  Still possible.
[10231.63s -> 10236.21s]  Can we leave the border's bookstore, dad?
[10237.23s -> 10238.75s]  No, I can do this shit for free.
[10239.31s -> 10243.58s]  I just have to pretend I'm reading books and pretend I'm browsing.
[10265.10s -> 10267.66s]  Two, three, four, five, three, four, five.
[10272.77s -> 10273.89s]  Ooh, I think we got it.
[10274.69s -> 10275.97s]  That's how you narrow it down.
[10277.62s -> 10288.21s]  Yes, okay.
[10289.01s -> 10294.05s]  So then now we got two.
[10295.17s -> 10296.21s]  Still got nothing over here.
[10296.77s -> 10310.82s]  Let me just get this out of the way because this is two now.
[10312.45s -> 10313.65s]  So it has to be here, here.
[10314.53s -> 10316.21s]  That one is not correct there.
[10316.93s -> 10320.24s]  One, two, one.
[10322.40s -> 10324.08s]  Again, that can be closed.
[10324.80s -> 10328.02s]  There's your two right there.
[10329.47s -> 10330.75s]  But is it?
[10332.62s -> 10333.66s]  I know that's correct.
[10334.38s -> 10337.41s]  But is this also a two here?
[10338.05s -> 10338.55s]  Yeah.
[10339.74s -> 10341.66s]  Uh, yeah.
[10342.38s -> 10356.38s]  All right, slow it down here.
[10356.38s -> 10359.68s]  And that's one, two, fuck.
[10360.24s -> 10361.92s]  One, two, three, four, fuck.
[10370.30s -> 10373.66s]  No, what did I do wrong here?
[10373.66s -> 10374.70s]  What did I assume there?
[10375.42s -> 10380.08s]  Because that's one, two, three.
[10380.08s -> 10381.84s]  This was, this was here the whole time.
[10381.84s -> 10382.64s]  This is new here.
[10383.36s -> 10386.10s]  The one and three.
[10386.10s -> 10396.58s]  But that, uh, where did this go wrong?
[10396.58s -> 10397.38s]  I don't want to reset this.
[10397.38s -> 10398.74s]  I feel like just one block is wrong.
[10400.10s -> 10412.69s]  Three, two, move this.
[10412.69s -> 10413.41s]  Hold on.
[10413.41s -> 10421.22s]  One, one.
[10421.22s -> 10424.83s]  No, this, this is, this is the wrong, this row is wrong.
[10425.71s -> 10426.67s]  Something's fucked up here.
[10427.94s -> 10430.50s]  Because two and then five, how did this come up?
[10431.52s -> 10432.96s]  This is the correct part.
[10433.60s -> 10449.68s]  Yeah, this is fucked up.
[10450.24s -> 10454.56s]  Damn it, I'm gonna have to restart it.
[10454.56s -> 10456.88s]  Oh, it's the worst part when you play Picross.
[10457.76s -> 10461.04s]  You jumble up one thing and then you can't,
[10461.04s -> 10462.64s]  your brain has already done it.
[10462.64s -> 10464.40s]  So you try to go back and you're like, fuck.
[10465.34s -> 10466.30s]  What did I do wrong?
[10466.86s -> 10502.35s]  Three, two, two, four.
[10502.35s -> 10504.35s]  No, but that's not right.
[10504.35s -> 10505.87s]  Why, what's so wrong here?
[10506.51s -> 10509.95s]  You know what I mean?
[10509.95s -> 10511.63s]  Like this is so wrong.
[10511.63s -> 10513.47s]  Something fucked up in here.
[10514.45s -> 10516.29s]  Either this is wrong or this is wrong.
[10517.94s -> 10519.22s]  E and F seven.
[10519.22s -> 10520.10s]  E seven, F seven.
[10526.98s -> 10529.54s]  Something like right here is just bogus.
[10530.18s -> 10538.26s]  Just if I could just work around it.
[10538.26s -> 10538.90s]  Yeah, that's true.
[10538.90s -> 10539.94s]  I could just work around it.
[10540.58s -> 10545.84s]  So now one, two, three, four, five.
[10546.48s -> 10551.95s]  This is the only possibility is this.
[10552.59s -> 10554.45s]  It can't be anything else.
[10555.01s -> 10562.40s]  Then if that's the case, let me remove this.
[10563.04s -> 10565.92s]  So there's two here.
[10565.92s -> 10566.80s]  There's two again.
[10567.44s -> 10571.57s]  Two, there's the two.
[10572.29s -> 10573.54s]  Cover that.
[10574.54s -> 10575.26s]  There's your three.
[10575.26s -> 10575.98s]  There's your two.
[10576.78s -> 10577.66s]  There's your four.
[10578.62s -> 10579.94s]  I think I fixed it.
[10580.58s -> 10583.02s]  Yeah, I think I got it.
[10583.02s -> 10586.02s]  Yep, and there's five.
[10586.02s -> 10586.34s]  Perfect.
[10586.34s -> 10587.06s]  Okay, thank God.
[10587.94s -> 10592.50s]  There it is.
[10592.50s -> 10593.06s]  Okay, nice.
[10593.78s -> 10603.14s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10603.14s -> 10604.10s]  No, it's wrong again.
[10609.63s -> 10610.43s]  What happened here?
[10615.39s -> 10625.70s]  Because two and then four.
[10625.70s -> 10626.50s]  All right.
[10626.50s -> 10628.18s]  Is everything else intact still?
[10634.30s -> 10634.94s]  I think so.
[10634.94s -> 10635.90s]  Everything's intact.
[10648.94s -> 10650.30s]  Guess resident sleeper.
[10650.30s -> 10651.58s]  That's not what it is.
[10651.58s -> 10653.07s]  I'm going to try again.
[10663.52s -> 10666.14s]  Well, that takes care of that.
[10675.73s -> 10680.54s]  All right, saved.
[10680.54s -> 10682.46s]  One, two, three, four, seven.
[10683.18s -> 10686.62s]  I've got a lot to erase here.
[10690.83s -> 10697.34s]  All right, it's two again.
[10704.59s -> 10708.70s]  I think it's resident sleeper.
[10708.70s -> 10709.34s]  Close.
[10709.34s -> 10710.30s]  Close, very close.
[10710.86s -> 10714.85s]  So this is a food.
[10714.85s -> 10716.21s]  What type of food is this?
[10732.58s -> 10775.14s]  Uh-oh, and then, and then.
[10775.14s -> 10779.06s]  Oh, it's so close.
[10779.06s -> 10780.34s]  It's right here.
[10780.34s -> 10786.13s]  Got it.
[10786.13s -> 10786.77s]  What is it?
[10786.77s -> 10788.14s]  Cookie?
[10788.14s -> 10789.90s]  It looks like a croissant.
[10789.90s -> 10792.62s]  Look at that croissant.
[10792.62s -> 10794.70s]  A lot of you did, actually.
[10794.70s -> 10802.02s]  Nice work.
[10802.02s -> 10803.14s]  Meme food.
[10803.14s -> 10805.39s]  I love croissants.
[10805.39s -> 10806.67s]  The problem with croissants is
[10806.67s -> 10808.75s]  I never order them because
[10808.75s -> 10811.14s]  it doesn't matter how you try to eat a croissant.
[10812.50s -> 10814.02s]  You get sawdust all over you
[10814.02s -> 10817.04s]  like you're in shop class.
[10817.04s -> 10818.08s]  Bite into a croissant
[10818.08s -> 10821.84s]  and there's just shavings of wood everywhere.
[10821.84s -> 10825.57s]  Don't eat that shit in your car.
[10825.57s -> 10833.60s]  Like you made a birdhouse
[10833.60s -> 10835.84s]  in like the, in your passenger side.
[10835.84s -> 10839.14s]  10, 11, 12.
[10839.14s -> 10840.18s]  All right, it's 15.
[10840.18s -> 10841.62s]  This is construction.
[10841.62s -> 10842.58s]  Speaking of construction.
[10848.08s -> 10848.88s]  And don't eat in your car.
[10848.88s -> 10850.40s]  Pay attention to the damn road.
[10850.40s -> 10857.65s]  All right, so we got 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[10857.65s -> 10862.99s]  So 11, 12, 13, 14, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[10865.30s -> 10866.02s]  Okay.
[10866.02s -> 10873.12s]  What about over here?
[10874.13s -> 10874.63s]  10.
[10875.01s -> 10875.73s]  Take a look at this.
[10875.73s -> 10877.57s]  11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[10878.98s -> 10881.22s]  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[10881.22s -> 10881.86s]  Cool.
[10881.86s -> 10882.34s]  Sick.
[10882.34s -> 10882.66s]  Nice.
[10882.66s -> 10883.16s]  Yeah.
[10883.62s -> 10890.80s]  This is definitely not a three.
[10891.52s -> 10896.06s]  God, I love Picross.
[10896.06s -> 10898.54s]  I have an unhealthy obsession with these games for some reason.
[10898.54s -> 10900.86s]  Me too.
[10900.86s -> 10901.66s]  I come back to it.
[10902.30s -> 10905.73s]  They have a couple of great ones for iPad.
[10908.70s -> 10911.10s]  I just open my mouth and lie in bed on iPad
[10911.10s -> 10913.34s]  and play these maybe like once or twice a week.
[10913.98s -> 10915.97s]  Picross, yeah.
[10915.97s -> 10919.01s]  I say Picross because it's like saying Reese's.
[10920.82s -> 10922.26s]  Reese's Pieces.
[10922.26s -> 10923.70s]  I don't say Reese's Pieces.
[10924.34s -> 10927.41s]  We've had a conversation about this, I know.
[10927.41s -> 10931.17s]  But it's nice to come back and see
[10931.17s -> 10932.61s]  how we're doing in that conversation.
[10940.16s -> 10940.96s]  So now what?
[10944.61s -> 10946.45s]  Well, that's not a three.
[10947.25s -> 10948.27s]  Neither is that.
[10949.44s -> 10950.72s]  Narrow down our 11 here.
[10960.66s -> 10962.64s]  Doesn't help very much.
[10966.24s -> 10967.28s]  It's Reese's.
[10968.00s -> 10970.29s]  There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.
[10971.01s -> 10981.38s]  And there's no wrong way to say Reese's either.
[10981.38s -> 10984.61s]  All right.
[10984.61s -> 10986.21s]  Let's put this to bed once and for all.
[10988.83s -> 10989.71s]  Everyone's saying I'm wrong.
[10989.71s -> 10992.27s]  You're wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[10992.27s -> 10998.51s]  Let's see.
[10998.51s -> 10999.47s]  I'm curious.
[10999.47s -> 11032.69s]  I just want to get a poll and chat's opinion on the whole thing.
[11038.43s -> 11041.23s]  Every stream is the same argument over pronunciation.
[11041.23s -> 11041.47s]  Yeah.
[11041.47s -> 11042.67s]  Some people have accents.
[11042.67s -> 11044.35s]  Some people say things differently.
[11045.07s -> 11045.87s]  Come on.
[11045.87s -> 11052.00s]  That's one.
[11052.00s -> 11053.28s]  So two, space, one.
[11053.28s -> 11054.48s]  So it could be there and then here we go.
[11055.04s -> 11060.43s]  So here we go.
[11060.43s -> 11064.27s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[11064.27s -> 11068.38s]  Five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[11068.38s -> 11074.27s]  Thank you.
[11081.04s -> 11081.68s]  Another one.
[11082.40s -> 11084.38s]  I don't, I hate when there's too many ones.
[11087.42s -> 11100.80s]  Well, so 30% of you guys from the sampling here say it that way as a Reese's.
[11100.80s -> 11105.86s]  The bookstore is closing.
[11107.09s -> 11108.77s]  No, I'm like, I'm not leaving.
[11111.41s -> 11112.69s]  I'm not leaving the bookstore.
[11113.33s -> 11121.34s]  What else can I do here?
[11124.61s -> 11125.65s]  There's shit posting.
[11127.76s -> 11137.55s]  So, well, it's definitely not down here because this is the three.
[11138.86s -> 11139.74s]  One, two, three.
[11139.74s -> 11140.30s]  So look at that.
[11145.01s -> 11149.34s]  We got our nine and our two.
[11158.51s -> 11159.23s]  Is it the whole thing?
[11159.79s -> 11160.83s]  Oh, I'm stupid.
[11162.34s -> 11163.86s]  Just fucking Reese posting.
[11167.04s -> 11168.00s]  Reese's PCs.
[11168.56s -> 11170.70s]  It's how I've been saying it since I was a kid.
[11170.70s -> 11171.66s]  I can't change it now.
[11180.74s -> 11182.58s]  I have to, no, Reese's PCs.
[11183.22s -> 11185.10s]  Then you were wrong as a kid.
[11188.51s -> 11189.07s]  That's fine.
[11191.04s -> 11192.24s]  I'd like how it sounds better.
[11202.93s -> 11204.13s]  Fair enough.
[11204.13s -> 11211.47s]  There's a one in here somewhere.
[11211.47s -> 11231.18s]  Might be here.
[11231.18s -> 11235.06s]  Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[11238.86s -> 11239.58s]  Something's wrong here.
[11241.26s -> 11244.02s]  What's wrong here?
[11244.50s -> 11247.94s]  This is not, this is all right.
[11247.94s -> 11248.74s]  This is fine, right?
[11249.46s -> 11268.13s]  Oh, this is okay.
[11268.13s -> 11271.01s]  The future is now, old man.
[11271.01s -> 11271.41s]  What do you mean?
[11274.75s -> 11275.47s]  I don't know what that means.
[11276.11s -> 11284.67s]  I mean the future is now.
[11285.23s -> 11294.11s]  Is that too many tens?
[11301.44s -> 11302.24s]  Your time is up.
[11302.24s -> 11303.44s]  My time is now.
[11303.44s -> 11310.32s]  I got plenty of time.
[11310.32s -> 11321.02s]  What do we got?
[11321.02s -> 11322.30s]  Well, one's one.
[11322.30s -> 11325.90s]  One, three, one.
[11328.34s -> 11329.78s]  This is some kind of construction.
[11329.78s -> 11331.62s]  Was it building material?
[11332.50s -> 11332.82s]  Wood?
[11333.62s -> 11334.42s]  I would say wood.
[11335.06s -> 11351.89s]  This could be one, one, three.
[11352.61s -> 11354.16s]  I don't want to blow it.
[11355.52s -> 11356.56s]  This on the other hand is one.
[11356.56s -> 11357.44s]  This is three here.
[11360.67s -> 11361.71s]  How does that change this?
[11362.75s -> 11364.93s]  All right.
[11365.65s -> 11377.42s]  Where's this last three right here?
[11377.42s -> 11378.38s]  No, don't guess.
[11379.26s -> 11387.25s]  Three, one, three.
[11387.81s -> 11394.08s]  Sure don't miss any place I can fill in.
[11395.36s -> 11395.84s]  Right there.
[11395.84s -> 11403.89s]  And this three is the right there.
[11404.37s -> 11404.53s]  All right.
[11404.53s -> 11405.01s]  What is it?
[11410.77s -> 11411.49s]  Stairs?
[11412.37s -> 11415.04s]  Oh, damn.
[11415.04s -> 11415.36s]  Okay.
[11416.40s -> 11418.54s]  I think that makes sense.
[11419.50s -> 11422.54s]  A lot of twos.
[11423.26s -> 11426.62s]  Two, four, six, eight, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.
[11426.62s -> 11426.94s]  Damn it.
[11427.50s -> 11431.90s]  Not enough twos.
[11431.90s -> 11442.05s]  I can start off down here though.
[11442.05s -> 11442.53s]  That's good.
[11443.41s -> 11450.53s]  This whole bottom area is just three.
[11451.57s -> 11454.29s]  Cool.
[11454.29s -> 11456.53s]  It helps a lot.
[11459.94s -> 11460.98s]  And there's our three right here.
[11460.98s -> 11461.38s]  Perfect.
[11461.38s -> 11462.34s]  There's another two.
[11462.34s -> 11463.38s]  Another two.
[11463.38s -> 11464.02s]  That's a one.
[11464.66s -> 11467.97s]  Another two.
[11467.97s -> 11468.53s]  Yes.
[11468.53s -> 11469.49s]  Shit, a lot of twos.
[11469.49s -> 11471.33s]  Keep that in mind while we're progressing.
[11472.45s -> 11476.86s]  Two, three.
[11481.94s -> 11482.26s]  Here.
[11482.82s -> 11484.37s]  More twos.
[11484.37s -> 11486.05s]  Two, two, two, two, two, two, two.
[11487.10s -> 11489.42s]  It's probably mirrored, right?
[11489.42s -> 11490.06s]  I would assume.
[11491.09s -> 11491.81s]  Is it mirrored?
[11491.81s -> 11492.37s]  No, it's not.
[11495.50s -> 11496.30s]  It's my turn.
[11496.86s -> 11502.53s]  No, it's my turn.
[11503.09s -> 11510.70s]  Three.
[11510.70s -> 11511.58s]  There's another one.
[11511.58s -> 11511.90s]  All right.
[11512.70s -> 11515.73s]  So weirdly enough, this is not mirrored.
[11515.73s -> 11515.97s]  Why?
[11516.77s -> 11519.78s]  Two, two, one, one, two.
[11519.78s -> 11521.30s]  Two, one, one, one, two.
[11522.18s -> 11525.15s]  I'd like a turn, please.
[11527.38s -> 11527.62s]  No.
[11528.26s -> 11532.59s]  So this is from fantasy.
[11533.15s -> 11535.94s]  Whatever that means.
[11535.94s -> 11539.41s]  Concerned that this is wrong already.
[11539.41s -> 11540.45s]  But I don't think it is.
[11541.09s -> 11547.52s]  There's too many spaces here.
[11548.08s -> 11548.64s]  What about here?
[11550.14s -> 11552.48s]  This is another one.
[11552.48s -> 11553.04s]  Another one.
[11553.04s -> 11553.84s]  And another one.
[11553.84s -> 11554.48s]  Okay.
[11554.48s -> 11556.11s]  Is he enough?
[11556.11s -> 11556.83s]  Same thing over here?
[11557.55s -> 11563.01s]  That's all I can go off of at the moment.
[11563.01s -> 11568.32s]  No, this like fucks with my head.
[11568.32s -> 11572.59s]  All right.
[11572.59s -> 11573.07s]  Slow down.
[11573.63s -> 11576.61s]  It's one, two, three, four.
[11579.33s -> 11580.85s]  One, two, three, four.
[11580.85s -> 11582.53s]  So none of these in the middle are going to be filled in.
[11587.78s -> 11588.58s]  Any others like that?
[11588.58s -> 11588.82s]  Yeah.
[11588.82s -> 11589.22s]  Three.
[11589.22s -> 11591.38s]  One, two, so one, two, three.
[11592.26s -> 11594.30s]  All right.
[11596.35s -> 11597.63s]  Any more like that?
[11602.48s -> 11602.80s]  Maybe.
[11605.82s -> 11607.42s]  What is telling you to fill in what squares?
[11609.09s -> 11610.29s]  We're like really relaxed.
[11611.17s -> 11613.01s]  We're just chill now.
[11613.01s -> 11613.73s]  I can explain it.
[11614.45s -> 11616.83s]  Because there are actually people that are asking questions.
[11617.47s -> 11623.49s]  You know, people are asking questions.
[11623.97s -> 11628.24s]  So let's start with this.
[11631.36s -> 11634.48s]  The cubes that you're filling in correspond to the numbers.
[11634.48s -> 11636.14s]  So for instance, three.
[11636.78s -> 11641.26s]  That means that there has to be three squares filled in in a row for this number here.
[11641.82s -> 11643.41s]  This way, right?
[11643.41s -> 11644.29s]  Because on this row.
[11645.30s -> 11648.42s]  Now, the one here means that after you, the three,
[11648.42s -> 11657.79s]  there has to be at least one space before that one comes into play.
[11657.79s -> 11661.47s]  So again, let's just say for the sake of just doing it,
[11661.87s -> 11666.43s]  it was three, space, one, space, right?
[11666.43s -> 11667.87s]  Because there's a space before this one.
[11669.07s -> 11671.39s]  One, space, two, right?
[11671.39s -> 11673.31s]  That would be, this is not correct.
[11673.31s -> 11677.22s]  But that space can be one or it can be eight.
[11677.22s -> 11679.74s]  Doesn't matter.
[11679.74s -> 11681.34s]  And you're supposed to logically deduce,
[11681.98s -> 11684.19s]  I just fucked up this whole line.
[11685.95s -> 11686.43s]  What was it?
[11688.19s -> 11689.47s]  No, okay, I'm fine.
[11689.47s -> 11695.10s]  That is only one.
[11695.10s -> 11695.34s]  Yeah.
[11696.22s -> 11699.18s]  So if it's 15 by 15, you start,
[11699.18s -> 11701.02s]  for instance, see how I started down here.
[11701.02s -> 11706.16s]  Filled in all 15, all 15 again.
[11706.16s -> 11708.08s]  And that completed these rows.
[11708.08s -> 11710.00s]  Now what happens is then take a look up here, right?
[11710.00s -> 11712.96s]  Because this is the top of the grid.
[11712.96s -> 11714.77s]  This is the bottom of the grid.
[11714.77s -> 11716.93s]  So you work from the bottom up here.
[11716.93s -> 11717.97s]  So see how that's two.
[11718.85s -> 11720.45s]  Both are filled in here.
[11720.45s -> 11721.41s]  That's done.
[11721.41s -> 11724.82s]  So then you put a marker here
[11724.82s -> 11726.82s]  because you know that there has to be at least one space.
[11729.47s -> 11732.77s]  See how down here, once I filled in this row again,
[11732.77s -> 11734.61s]  there's three, one, two, three has to get filled in.
[11734.61s -> 11735.73s]  Marker has to go here.
[11735.73s -> 11741.39s]  It's very interesting, very relaxing.
[11741.39s -> 11742.27s]  And it makes a picture.
[11742.27s -> 11743.47s]  That's the best part.
[11743.47s -> 11746.58s]  Okay, but how do you play it?
[11747.30s -> 11753.79s]  Okay, but how do you play it?
[11753.79s -> 11768.45s]  You know how to play.
[11768.45s -> 11769.73s]  I don't get it.
[11769.73s -> 11773.09s]  I'll make it really easy after this level.
[11773.65s -> 11776.05s]  For the handful of people.
[11776.05s -> 11777.81s]  Yeah, I mean, there's 2,500 people here.
[11777.81s -> 11780.85s]  And maybe 2,400 of you get it.
[11780.85s -> 11782.77s]  But what about the new people that came in
[11782.77s -> 11785.09s]  that just want to, you know, are curious?
[11785.73s -> 11786.62s]  We're just hanging out.
[11786.62s -> 11788.38s]  It's not like, it's not a big deal.
[11789.87s -> 11790.67s]  Not a big deal at all.
[11791.23s -> 11791.89s]  It's fine.
[11792.45s -> 11797.78s]  All right, so let's get back to it.
[11798.42s -> 11804.99s]  Three, I sense sarcasm.
[11804.99s -> 11806.27s]  No, that's an old reference.
[11806.91s -> 11812.18s]  This could be the one, because then that's two.
[11815.42s -> 11817.34s]  But I did give myself this, which is good.
[11817.34s -> 11819.90s]  So this could be one, two, three, four.
[11819.90s -> 11821.66s]  One, two, three, four.
[11821.66s -> 11825.79s]  So, okay.
[11833.90s -> 11835.10s]  No, that's not, I don't have that info.
[11835.82s -> 11840.43s]  Because that would mean it could be here, but it's not.
[11842.00s -> 11843.92s]  So I got another two, right?
[11843.92s -> 11847.07s]  Because it's two, two, two.
[11847.63s -> 11850.27s]  Same thing on this one, right?
[11850.27s -> 11851.23s]  No, that's two, one.
[11853.92s -> 11854.88s]  So that's three, one.
[11854.88s -> 11856.80s]  That's a one, which makes this the three.
[11857.92s -> 11858.48s]  Perfect, done.
[11862.61s -> 11864.13s]  No info required.
[11864.85s -> 11868.96s]  Somebody just guess ham.
[11869.60s -> 11870.56s]  Why would this be ham?
[11870.56s -> 11871.12s]  Two, one.
[11872.77s -> 11873.89s]  Two, wait, wait, wait.
[11873.89s -> 11875.17s]  Two, one.
[11875.17s -> 11876.99s]  That's one.
[11877.98s -> 11879.34s]  Wait a minute, two, one, one.
[11879.34s -> 11879.98s]  This could be two.
[11880.62s -> 11884.46s]  What about this one?
[11884.46s -> 11886.54s]  Two, two, two.
[11887.26s -> 11892.08s]  Need more info down here.
[11901.18s -> 11902.94s]  Yes, space invader.
[11902.94s -> 11904.22s]  Now that's a pretty good one.
[11904.22s -> 11905.66s]  That's actually a really good guess.
[11907.33s -> 11908.21s]  It very well could be.
[11911.63s -> 11917.79s]  Let's fill this shit in, because this has to be here or here.
[11917.79s -> 11919.94s]  And one, two, three.
[11919.94s -> 11921.38s]  This is all no.
[11922.42s -> 11925.22s]  And this is filled in.
[11927.20s -> 11930.34s]  Two, two, two, two.
[11930.34s -> 11930.98s]  This is done.
[11931.78s -> 11933.81s]  Okay, nice.
[11934.62s -> 11935.18s]  Is it?
[11935.18s -> 11935.90s]  I'm confused.
[11935.90s -> 11941.74s]  I'm going to lead us up here.
[11941.74s -> 11942.78s]  Is this four, one?
[11944.59s -> 11948.96s]  One, two, four, two.
[11950.00s -> 11952.88s]  Four, one, two.
[11956.18s -> 11956.90s]  Four, one.
[11957.86s -> 11959.33s]  Could be up there.
[11960.21s -> 11961.49s]  Four, one, one.
[11962.53s -> 11964.30s]  But that could be one, one.
[11964.30s -> 11965.82s]  So let's leave that here for a second.
[11967.57s -> 11968.37s]  See what we did up here.
[11968.37s -> 11970.05s]  This is one, this is three.
[11971.01s -> 11973.12s]  There's the two, nice.
[11980.40s -> 11981.60s]  Still not sure about down here.
[11983.34s -> 11987.87s]  Two, one, three.
[11987.87s -> 11992.02s]  So could this be two, one, one, three?
[11992.02s -> 11992.74s]  No, this is it.
[11993.54s -> 12000.06s]  So this could be anywhere here.
[12000.70s -> 12001.58s]  All right, got that though.
[12002.30s -> 12013.06s]  Three, two, one.
[12013.22s -> 12014.26s]  All right, this is interesting.
[12014.98s -> 12016.10s]  It's either here or here.
[12016.82s -> 12021.81s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12022.77s -> 12025.17s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12025.17s -> 12027.09s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12027.97s -> 12030.54s]  I can't denominate this.
[12031.18s -> 12037.23s]  Hold on, let me see here.
[12037.95s -> 12040.74s]  All right, now I got this now.
[12040.74s -> 12043.14s]  So that's two, one.
[12044.96s -> 12057.86s]  One, two, right?
[12057.86s -> 12061.22s]  Because then now is that.
[12061.22s -> 12062.02s]  This would be three.
[12063.06s -> 12071.33s]  Don't want to get sloppy.
[12071.33s -> 12075.95s]  I'm missing a lot over here.
[12075.95s -> 12082.78s]  Let's see, two, one, one, one, two.
[12083.66s -> 12085.50s]  That's four, close it up.
[12085.50s -> 12086.70s]  That's three, close it.
[12086.70s -> 12087.58s]  This is done now.
[12087.58s -> 12088.62s]  All right, I'm almost done.
[12089.42s -> 12090.38s]  What even?
[12090.38s -> 12092.70s]  Maybe this actually might be a space invader.
[12092.70s -> 12099.47s]  I have nothing in this row.
[12100.03s -> 12100.43s]  How?
[12100.43s -> 12106.27s]  One, two, three, two, two.
[12106.27s -> 12108.43s]  No, for some reason I thought it was going to count higher than that.
[12114.66s -> 12115.94s]  Two, and there's the one.
[12117.41s -> 12117.65s]  Yes.
[12121.06s -> 12126.53s]  So, well, didn't fill that one in.
[12130.54s -> 12131.10s]  All right.
[12131.90s -> 12132.86s]  Where are you?
[12133.50s -> 12143.15s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12143.15s -> 12144.91s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12147.02s -> 12148.38s]  Over here, I'm over here.
[12149.18s -> 12163.78s]  Well, it could be here.
[12166.24s -> 12170.56s]  Two, two, three.
[12170.56s -> 12172.16s]  Well, the one is obviously right there.
[12179.73s -> 12181.25s]  In there somewhere, that's done.
[12184.30s -> 12185.02s]  There's three.
[12186.46s -> 12188.99s]  All right, closing in.
[12193.63s -> 12195.95s]  Six, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[12196.59s -> 12198.03s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12200.00s -> 12200.40s]  Seal it.
[12200.96s -> 12205.12s]  Two, two, what is it?
[12205.12s -> 12207.07s]  Spider?
[12207.07s -> 12208.75s]  Space invader?
[12208.75s -> 12211.52s]  It's a cave, a dungeon.
[12216.99s -> 12217.71s]  Nobody got it.
[12218.35s -> 12219.23s]  I don't know how you would have.
[12224.83s -> 12227.15s]  This is a very long music track.
[12227.15s -> 12229.63s]  It's, we've been listening to this for an hour and 44 minutes.
[12230.19s -> 12231.76s]  That's kind of surprising.
[12232.48s -> 12234.16s]  All right, electronic.
[12234.16s -> 12234.64s]  What time is it?
[12234.64s -> 12235.12s]  How are we doing?
[12237.55s -> 12238.11s]  Six hours.
[12240.02s -> 12242.10s]  I'm, I'm still all right.
[12242.10s -> 12243.06s]  I'm still just hanging out.
[12243.62s -> 12244.18s]  We're not done.
[12244.74s -> 12246.70s]  I'm going to go for like another little while.
[12247.26s -> 12251.84s]  Put on the Tetris OST.
[12252.48s -> 12263.20s]  But we're so relaxed.
[12263.92s -> 12272.32s]  All right, this is Tetris 99, full official soundtrack.
[12285.04s -> 12286.48s]  Regular Tet, like you mean like the
[12290.48s -> 12304.80s]  You can fill this whole thing in.
[12325.95s -> 12337.92s]  I need more ones.
[12338.56s -> 12344.90s]  I need more.
[12344.90s -> 12346.10s]  It's filling the zeros first.
[12346.10s -> 12346.82s]  What the hell am I doing?
[12352.88s -> 12354.00s]  Anymore.
[12354.00s -> 12356.67s]  Well, I found the first one.
[12356.67s -> 12361.23s]  And then it could be one, two, three, four.
[12361.23s -> 12362.27s]  One, two, three, four.
[12366.32s -> 12366.72s]  Nice.
[12366.72s -> 12367.28s]  Fill that out.
[12367.92s -> 12370.69s]  How are we now?
[12370.69s -> 12371.49s]  One still.
[12372.37s -> 12379.15s]  By this point, you should have had consumed at least 24 ounces of water.
[12380.29s -> 12381.49s]  Uh, I'm probably pretty close.
[12382.05s -> 12385.41s]  I've had a glass of water here the whole time.
[12385.41s -> 12399.31s]  Well, this is, this is the six.
[12401.54s -> 12402.82s]  Therefore, this is the six.
[12403.54s -> 12406.48s]  Then this has to be one, one.
[12407.12s -> 12421.87s]  It's info I don't have, but I can do at least those two.
[12422.59s -> 12424.34s]  What's the song called?
[12424.34s -> 12427.30s]  This is called Tetris 99 Main Theme.
[12428.86s -> 12435.06s]  You can download it off of the internet somewhere and enjoy it with your friends.
[12435.06s -> 12440.78s]  You can throw a party if you wanted to and put it on a six and a half hour repeat.
[12442.40s -> 12445.68s]  You could, I'm not saying you should, but I'm just saying it's possible.
[12451.14s -> 12453.30s]  Torrenting Tetris music.
[12453.30s -> 12454.34s]  No, that's not what I mean.
[12455.14s -> 12463.78s]  This has to be the six, right?
[12463.78s -> 12464.10s]  Yeah.
[12464.10s -> 12465.94s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12465.94s -> 12467.78s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12468.58s -> 12469.08s]  Yeah.
[12482.22s -> 12483.26s]  One of these is the two.
[12483.98s -> 12485.18s]  This one's probably the two.
[12488.80s -> 12489.84s]  If not, then it's down here.
[12490.56s -> 12491.36s]  Well, here's the eight.
[12503.82s -> 12504.62s]  How much did I fill in?
[12504.62s -> 12505.02s]  I forget.
[12507.04s -> 12507.84s]  Oh, shit.
[12507.84s -> 12508.64s]  I don't know.
[12508.64s -> 12509.44s]  I'm just gonna go like this.
[12514.46s -> 12515.82s]  That's more info than I had before.
[12515.82s -> 12516.30s]  I'm okay.
[12524.93s -> 12526.29s]  Is it all filled in?
[12526.29s -> 12533.20s]  Get a one and then a two up here somewhere.
[12533.76s -> 12537.47s]  This is something electronic.
[12544.11s -> 12544.51s]  Six.
[12548.10s -> 12548.90s]  So many ones.
[12550.93s -> 12554.94s]  Three, one, three.
[12555.66s -> 12557.84s]  More ones.
[12562.90s -> 12564.02s]  All right, what is this two?
[12567.62s -> 12569.46s]  You want the pirate marching band?
[12575.46s -> 12575.96s]  Why?
[12576.50s -> 12588.38s]  Do you really want me to put on the pirate marching band right now?
[12596.48s -> 12596.98s]  I...
[12596.98s -> 12598.08s]  Okay, hold on a minute.
[12598.72s -> 12601.92s]  This video has almost a million views.
[12603.97s -> 12608.37s]  There's a 737, 34,000 view video
[12608.37s -> 12613.49s]  and then a 173,000 re-upload for 10 hours.
[12613.49s -> 12614.29s]  This video has almost...
[12614.29s -> 12615.89s]  This video has been seen a million times.
[12618.06s -> 12618.46s]  Really?
[12619.02s -> 12619.90s]  I didn't even know that.
[12619.90s -> 12620.62s]  Holy shit.
[12621.26s -> 12630.51s]  Here it comes.
[12639.54s -> 12643.66s]  I little did I know that this year...
[12643.66s -> 12645.02s]  This many years later.
[12645.02s -> 12646.22s]  This stupid thing that I did.
[12648.70s -> 12655.31s]  Played at half speed.
[12660.35s -> 12661.23s]  Also not even true.
[12664.69s -> 12666.45s]  This is how I found out about you.
[12667.81s -> 12669.57s]  I imagine that conversation.
[12669.57s -> 12671.33s]  Hey, here's this guy that I have watched.
[12671.33s -> 12676.19s]  Check him out.
[12676.19s -> 12676.69s]  Two.
[12694.34s -> 12697.14s]  Don't you wish this was broadcasted nationally 4 AM
[12698.70s -> 12701.71s]  at everyone's alarm clocks?
[12702.27s -> 12704.99s]  I'm not entirely certain that I would like to do that
[12706.80s -> 12708.40s]  because that would probably get really bad.
[12708.40s -> 12709.44s]  Something just auto-played.
[12713.09s -> 12717.26s]  This is YMCA, but it's got a twist.
[12733.87s -> 12740.67s]  How long is this?
[12740.67s -> 12742.43s]  There are so many rat remixes.
[12742.91s -> 12744.05s]  I've heard a bunch of them.
[12744.69s -> 12746.46s]  All right, where am I going here?
[12747.34s -> 12748.14s]  Probably down here.
[12760.18s -> 12762.26s]  I can't focus on anything else.
[12766.80s -> 12771.74s]  Two, three, I have six.
[12773.42s -> 12774.14s]  One, six.
[12776.64s -> 12778.72s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12778.72s -> 12780.64s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[12783.38s -> 12789.50s]  Ah, three, one, one.
[12792.43s -> 12795.22s]  I'm getting speech jammed.
[12796.02s -> 12799.49s]  It's still going.
[12810.58s -> 12813.38s]  I can't do it with this music playing.
[12813.38s -> 12821.04s]  Why did that take this long to play these songs?
[12821.04s -> 12822.59s]  I don't know.
[12822.59s -> 12824.03s]  It just kind of never came up.
[12824.67s -> 12829.65s]  I need more info.
[12832.40s -> 12834.16s]  A poor craftsman blames his tools.
[12834.96s -> 12837.44s]  Or, okay, if you were making a birdhouse
[12837.44s -> 12838.72s]  and I came in and started going,
[12838.72s -> 12840.48s]  Retch, retch, we had a retch.
[12841.62s -> 12842.74s]  In your ear, you'd probably be like,
[12843.30s -> 12843.94s]  what are you doing?
[12854.10s -> 12854.74s]  No, no, no.
[12854.74s -> 12855.94s]  What's the next one?
[12855.94s -> 12857.28s]  This is the mixtape.
[12858.30s -> 12859.42s]  I think this is just the original one.
[12872.86s -> 12875.89s]  I can't.
[12881.41s -> 12883.01s]  Yeah, I know that that's on osu!
[12884.66s -> 12885.06s]  Where am I?
[12885.06s -> 12887.30s]  I'm like going forward, forward, forward.
[12888.11s -> 12889.95s]  I skipped the best part?
[12889.95s -> 12890.91s]  What do you mean the best part?
[12891.63s -> 12894.54s]  What happened to my smooth jazz?
[12895.18s -> 12897.02s]  I was working on my brain function.
[12901.97s -> 12903.97s]  How long does it take you to make those lyrics?
[12903.97s -> 12908.91s]  Uh, six or seven minutes, probably.
[12908.91s -> 12909.63s]  Maybe ten minutes.
[12910.19s -> 12911.94s]  There's a new one that I have.
[12913.39s -> 12915.39s]  And it was supposed to be for the third one.
[12915.39s -> 12916.43s]  I might as well just do it.
[12916.43s -> 12917.47s]  I might as well just tell you what it was.
[12920.05s -> 12923.39s]  Yeah, well, this is a secret chillout stream.
[12924.91s -> 12928.03s]  Would you like to load the lyrics for the third rat song?
[12930.66s -> 12932.26s]  Because I can't imagine a time
[12932.26s -> 12933.62s]  where I'm going to be able to work on it for real.
[12934.88s -> 12936.00s]  And if you hear it, it's fine.
[12937.14s -> 12939.62s]  So it was a little play on words.
[12941.87s -> 12946.43s]  it's the same sentence, but three times means different things.
[12947.15s -> 12947.87s]  Are you ready?
[12948.43s -> 12952.40s]  So it starts off like a like a rap beat almost.
[12953.28s -> 12958.64s]  And it goes.
[12975.60s -> 12994.59s]  where they at where they at there you go that actually was the whole song it is
[12994.59s -> 13004.65s]  that's how it is gonna be like bunches fucking trumpets sounds gonna make a
[13004.65s -> 13009.62s]  real one that's fine yeah it was where the rats where the rats just where the
[13009.62s -> 13017.65s]  rats where they at where they at yeah where the rats like this you know now
[13017.65s -> 13029.14s]  you already you know yeah like where the rats then where are the rats where
[13029.14s -> 13033.86s]  they at they've got to come out of the sewers and shit while it was
[13033.86s -> 13036.98s]  playing they're all gonna get more crowded more people more rats singing at
[13036.98s -> 13043.20s]  the same time that's where to go that that that's the song that is the song
[13043.20s -> 13053.75s]  let's go make it let's make it right now yeah fuck it I'll bear it back
[13053.75s -> 13338.51s]  hold on I'm still going I remember I said seven to eight minutes it was
[13338.51s -> 13344.87s]  probably a lie probably took like 30 probably like an hour let me get let
[13344.87s -> 13348.62s]  me make sure this is going here I wasn't just gonna pull a song from
[13348.62s -> 13351.46s]  royalty-free I was gonna have it made so there's no song to go along
[13351.46s -> 13369.37s]  with it I can zoom in here I'm gonna do take figure oh yeah here
[13369.37s -> 13377.14s]  comes a take a live take I'll do I'm gonna do one part of it it's easier to
[13377.14s -> 13393.25s]  do in two breaths and that's a little bit of them this has a little cleaner
[13393.25s -> 13401.93s]  you want to make that I'll just make the fucking thing right now hold on
[13401.93s -> 13411.24s]  it's gonna be louder though it's kind of soft and I'll just do like a
[13411.24s -> 13418.14s]  little I'll do like a little beatbox behind it
[13418.14s -> 13421.90s]  where the rats where the rats just where the rats need to be a little
[13421.90s -> 13444.82s]  higher than that not that much rat lore incoming I
[13444.90s -> 13450.92s]  wouldn't say rat lore let's see how does this sound
[13453.92s -> 13465.18s]  no a little off here I moved it too much I need to really unfortunately have
[13465.18s -> 13470.14s]  to crank my microphone for this I really don't think I can actually do it
[13470.14s -> 13487.97s]  on stream it's a way off key as well way off key it's got to change I was
[13487.97s -> 13506.10s]  here that's not bad let me turn this up
[13512.81s -> 13537.47s]  I am here six years later he did it on stream in 20 minutes perfect okay
[13537.51s -> 13549.02s]  how about the next part next part is to be a little bit more a little bit more
[13549.02s -> 13570.48s]  synced up here audacity why do you suck what's going on here why can I not
[13570.48s -> 13590.29s]  move this oh that's why something is wrong here what's going on
[13590.29s -> 13597.31s]  audacity what are you doing wait yeah audacity what are you doing to me
[13597.31s -> 13610.68s]  why can I not drag this what the hell the fuck is going on here yeah
[13611.68s -> 13620.41s]  for some reason I cannot move the track anymore it's like broken you know
[13620.41s -> 13624.25s]  audacity really is terrible for recording tracks but I kind of just
[13624.25s -> 13632.05s]  threw this open so I don't understand why I can't do this I've done this
[13632.05s -> 13636.39s]  probably I've done this probably a thousand times and I cannot select this
[13636.39s -> 13640.47s]  and move it and now magically I didn't even magic I can do it now
[13640.47s -> 13654.00s]  somebody has magic fucking potions see how this sounds
[13656.36s -> 13663.89s]  not bad not bad maybe needs a little bit more on the end here and then I'm
[13663.89s -> 13678.51s]  gonna copy it once and I'll give you a real take how's this we're gonna retch
[13678.51s -> 13685.88s]  whether yet whether yet yet we're gonna retch good we're gonna retch we're
[13685.88s -> 13692.91s]  gonna retch just we're gonna retch pull that forward a little just a hair
[13692.91s -> 13697.14s]  we're gonna retch we're gonna retch just we're gonna retch we're gonna get
[13698.14s -> 13706.08s]  all right here comes a new take
[13724.68s -> 13737.26s]  yeah it's problem with audacity is when you record it puts everything else off
[13737.26s -> 13745.94s]  sync for some reason you can't have to go back in this is just for fun I'm
[13745.94s -> 13751.75s]  I'm not really trying to get it perfect or anything, I just want to get you an idea.
[13751.75s -> 13757.80s]  Need two headphones in for this.
[13757.80s -> 13764.78s]  I don't like that one.
[13764.78s -> 13772.46s]  I like the end of that though.
[13772.46s -> 13773.94s]  No.
[13773.94s -> 13783.30s]  Do it again.
[13783.30s -> 13786.81s]  No, do it again.
[13786.81s -> 13790.67s]  It's going to be like, way to yet, way to yet.
[13790.67s -> 13794.49s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13794.49s -> 13798.26s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13798.26s -> 13799.26s]  Fucking audacity.
[13799.26s -> 13802.08s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13802.08s -> 13805.08s]  Way to yet, way to yet, way to yet, way to retch.
[13805.08s -> 13812.27s]  No, why?
[13812.27s -> 13816.02s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13816.02s -> 13831.60s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13831.60s -> 13834.48s]  Okay, let's change that a little bit.
[13834.48s -> 13840.28s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13840.28s -> 13845.68s]  This is how you do it, man.
[13845.68s -> 13846.68s]  This is what I used to do.
[13846.68s -> 13852.67s]  I used to sit here and fucking do this all day.
[13852.67s -> 13855.67s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13855.67s -> 13859.38s]  That's not so fucking wrong.
[13859.38s -> 13861.38s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13861.38s -> 13868.81s]  Way to yet, way to yet, yeah.
[13868.81s -> 13870.81s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13870.81s -> 13871.81s]  No, that's too low.
[13871.81s -> 13877.36s]  Way to retch, way to...
[13877.36s -> 13879.36s]  Way to retch, way to retch, just way to retch.
[13879.36s -> 13885.99s]  That's the tone I'm looking for.
[13885.99s -> 13887.99s]  I think we can get this copied a couple times.
[13887.99s -> 13889.99s]  Yeah, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.
[13889.99s -> 13892.26s]  This one's a little too low.
[13892.26s -> 13895.46s]  I'm going to give another take here.
[13895.46s -> 13898.14s]  Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.
[13898.14s -> 13905.12s]  Yeah, way to retch.
[13905.12s -> 13907.83s]  No, that would be like...
[13907.83s -> 13909.83s]  Way to retch, way to retch.
[13909.83s -> 13912.07s]  Uh-uh.
[13912.07s -> 13914.07s]  Way to yet, yeah, way to retch.
[13914.07s -> 13915.07s]  No, that's wrong.
[13915.07s -> 13917.95s]  Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.
[13917.95s -> 13925.12s]  Way to yet, yeah, way to retch.
[13925.12s -> 13933.50s]  Yeah, yeah, way to retch.
[13933.50s -> 13938.14s]  Uh-uh.
[13938.14s -> 13939.14s]  Just way to retch.
[13939.14s -> 13942.14s]  Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.
[13942.14s -> 13943.14s]  No, I can't.
[13943.14s -> 13945.72s]  Move this to creative.
[13945.72s -> 13949.24s]  I'd have to show it.
[13949.24s -> 13950.61s]  Way to retch, way to retch.
[13950.61s -> 13951.61s]  No.
[13951.61s -> 13952.61s]  Way to retch, way to retch.
[13952.61s -> 13953.61s]  Yes, way to retch.
[13953.61s -> 13955.61s]  When it comes up like that.
[13955.61s -> 13958.49s]  I'm naked right now in front of you guys.
[13958.49s -> 13959.49s]  You understand that, right?
[13959.49s -> 13963.82s]  You're seeing me completely undressed in front of you.
[13963.82s -> 13971.24s]  Way to retch, way to retch.
[13971.24s -> 13972.24s]  Yes, way to retch.
[13972.24s -> 13974.24s]  Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.
[13974.24s -> 13977.02s]  He's fucking naked.
[13977.02s -> 13981.02s]  Now let me just get the next part, because this is fine.
[13981.02s -> 13983.02s]  Way to retch, way to yet, way to retch.
[13983.02s -> 13986.16s]  This part needs to be moved, but...
[13986.16s -> 13990.19s]  Yeah, way to retch.
[13990.19s -> 13991.37s]  Okay.
[13991.37s -> 13992.37s]  Then it's...
[13992.37s -> 13993.37s]  Way to retch, way to retch.
[13993.37s -> 13994.37s]  Yes, way to retch.
[13994.37s -> 13998.78s]  Way to yet, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.
[13998.78s -> 13999.78s]  Uh-uh.
[13999.78s -> 14000.78s]  Way to yet, yeah, way to retch.
[14000.78s -> 14001.78s]  Way to retch.
[14001.78s -> 14004.24s]  Uh-uh.
[14004.24s -> 14006.24s]  Way to yet, way to yet, yeah, way to retch.
[14006.24s -> 14007.24s]  Way to retch, way to retch.
[14007.24s -> 14008.24s]  Yes, way to retch.
[14008.24s -> 14010.24s]  Way to yet, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.
[14010.24s -> 14015.30s]  The VRB screen is still on.
[14015.30s -> 14016.30s]  You clown.
[14016.30s -> 14017.30s]  Yeah, way to retch.
[14017.30s -> 14029.99s]  Way to retch.
[14029.99s -> 14030.99s]  Way to retch, way to retch.
[14030.99s -> 14031.99s]  Yes, way to retch.
[14031.99s -> 14033.99s]  Way to retch, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.
[14033.99s -> 14034.99s]  I like that end here.
[14036.68s -> 14037.68s]  Okay.
[14037.68s -> 14045.70s]  I should be able to see it now.
[14045.70s -> 14052.90s]  At least I think you can.
[14052.90s -> 14053.90s]  Can you see it?
[14053.90s -> 14058.34s]  No.
[14058.34s -> 14060.86s]  I have to move this.
[14060.86s -> 14061.86s]  Hey, look at that!
[14061.86s -> 14062.86s]  Okay, so as you see here...
[14062.86s -> 14069.41s]  Way to retch, way to retch.
[14069.41s -> 14070.41s]  Yes, way to retch.
[14070.41s -> 14078.50s]  Way to yet, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.
[14078.50s -> 14079.50s]  I like the end here.
[14079.50s -> 14082.34s]  I don't like the beginning.
[14082.34s -> 14083.34s]  Way to retch, way to yet, way to yet, way to yet.

[14139.14s -> 14140.50s]  Change the pitch a little bit.
[14140.50s -> 14141.50s]  It sounded a little creepy.

[14567.83s -> 14568.83s]  I wouldn't fucking lose
[14568.83s -> 14569.83s]  okay
[14569.83s -> 14570.83s]  I would win that case

[14587.52s -> 14588.52s]  dream it
[14588.52s -> 14592.00s]  So long, don't give it up now, baby.
[14592.00s -> 14596.83s]  Don't give it up, don't give it up, don't give it up.
[14596.83s -> 14597.67s]  Throw it out.
[14597.67s -> 14598.43s]  Throw that out of court.
[14598.43s -> 14604.62s]  Doesn't belong here.

[14652.42s -> 14669.34s]  That's perfect to go by.
[14669.34s -> 14671.86s]  How would you even fucking think about that?
[14671.86s -> 14674.22s]  I have no idea.
[14674.22s -> 14677.73s]  All right, let's go back to the puzzle.
[14677.73s -> 14681.43s]  Let's finish what we were doing here.
[14681.43s -> 14683.07s]  And then I'm probably gonna call it.
[14683.15s -> 14685.98s]  And we'll do VR tomorrow.
[14685.98s -> 14687.30s]  Back into the headset.
[14687.30s -> 14688.30s]  I feel pretty good.
[14688.30s -> 14697.60s]  I'll be good to go.
[14697.60s -> 14699.32s]  Holy shit, this was a puzzle stream.
[14699.32s -> 14701.93s]  Yeah, it was.
[14701.93s -> 14704.66s]  Gonna finish, this is electronics.
[14704.66s -> 14705.66s]  Well, it's on the plate for VR.
[14705.66s -> 14718.38s]  I'm gonna do Minecraft VR just to get it out of the way.
[14718.38s -> 14720.60s]  And then after that, or maybe before that,
[14720.60s -> 14724.14s]  depending on how hard it is to set that up.
[14724.14s -> 14730.61s]  I do have at least three or four more VR games to play.
[14730.61s -> 14733.45s]  And then, so we had a stream yesterday,
[14733.45s -> 14735.11s]  stream today, stream tomorrow.
[14735.11s -> 14736.75s]  And then after tomorrow,
[14736.75s -> 14739.48s]  you're not gonna see me for a few days.
[14739.48s -> 14742.90s]  Taking a few days off in a row.
[14742.90s -> 14746.08s]  I've got some company that's coming up.
[14746.08s -> 14748.23s]  So I wanna spend some time with them.
[14748.23s -> 14749.31s]  So after tomorrow,
[14749.31s -> 14754.82s]  you will not see me until three days later.
[14754.82s -> 14758.04s]  Just wanna make sure you tell you no.
[14758.04s -> 14761.34s]  All right, finish this puzzle.
[14761.34s -> 14767.69s]  And then I'm gonna call it for the night.
[14767.69s -> 14773.58s]  I gotta clean this shit up, yeah, I know.
[14773.58s -> 14775.66s]  Fucking PictoPix again.
[14775.66s -> 14780.77s]  No, look, all right, I'm just gonna call it now.
[14780.77s -> 14782.77s]  I'm just gonna call it now.
[14782.77s -> 14783.97s]  That's the end of the stream.
[14783.97s -> 14788.96s]  Thanks for coming.
[14788.96s -> 14790.40s]  You know what, you guys do it.
[14790.40s -> 14793.37s]  You guys finish it up.
[14793.37s -> 14797.19s]  All right, let me finish this.
[14797.19s -> 14808.24s]  Self-conscious streamer, it can't get over it.
[14808.24s -> 14814.25s]  Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
[14814.25s -> 14820.80s]  All right, six has to go up this way.
[14820.80s -> 14823.42s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[14823.42s -> 14825.82s]  Let's just say it's probably up here.
[14825.82s -> 14827.78s]  Has to be at least one of those.
[14827.78s -> 14832.20s]  There's three.
[14832.20s -> 14833.56s]  Am I gonna play Devil May Cry for Sekiro?
[14833.56s -> 14837.02s]  I'm gonna play Sekiro day one.
[14837.02s -> 14841.05s]  So the day that Sekiro launches, I will be streaming it.
[14841.05s -> 14843.31s]  I'm going to enjoy that game.
[14843.31s -> 14845.29s]  I'm gonna play very, very patiently.
[14845.29s -> 14847.13s]  I'm gonna just love the fuck out of it.
[14847.13s -> 14850.70s]  So when is the gamer duel with Joel?
[14850.70s -> 14852.37s]  That's a good question.
[14852.37s -> 14855.89s]  Joel and I just recently became Discord friends.
[14855.89s -> 14857.27s]  So probably not,
[14857.27s -> 14858.21s]  probably that's probably not gonna happen
[14858.41s -> 14864.60s]  until after I get back from seeing friends.
[14864.60s -> 14865.82s]  We'll see.
[14865.82s -> 14867.96s]  Anywho, how are we doing here?
[14867.96s -> 14871.06s]  One, two, three, one, two, three.
[14871.06s -> 14872.10s]  Don't have enough info for this,
[14872.10s -> 14875.96s]  but we do have enough info to go here.
[14875.96s -> 14881.75s]  Cause that's that.
[14881.75s -> 14890.15s]  After all this time, you know?
[14890.15s -> 14893.78s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[14893.78s -> 14897.27s]  I just don't know which way.
[14897.27s -> 14902.13s]  One, one, one.
[14902.13s -> 14904.69s]  Is Discord friends marriage?
[14904.69s -> 14906.27s]  I don't think so.
[14906.27s -> 14911.06s]  I would say no.
[14911.06s -> 14920.36s]  What about down here?
[14920.36s -> 14925.86s]  I don't have enough info to fill that in.
[14925.86s -> 14926.74s]  It's three and three,
[14926.74s -> 14928.14s]  but it's don't have enough info.
[14928.14s -> 14929.20s]  I need more up here,
[14929.20s -> 14931.86s]  but how the fuck am I gonna get that?
[14931.86s -> 14936.63s]  I need to cancel some shit out up here.
[14936.63s -> 14939.55s]  I could do this,
[14939.55s -> 14940.99s]  which then lets me do that.
[14940.99s -> 14943.62s]  All right, keep going.
[14943.62s -> 14953.68s]  So it's pretty much mirrored until down here.
[14953.68s -> 14967.83s]  Six, um, damn, one, one.
[14967.83s -> 14968.91s]  I would say right here,
[14968.91s -> 14970.99s]  but it could be here too.
[14970.99s -> 14972.27s]  No, no, it couldn't.
[14972.27s -> 14974.22s]  No, it couldn't.
[14974.22s -> 14981.73s]  No, it could not.
[14981.73s -> 14983.65s]  Let's go with, this is done now.
[14983.65s -> 14987.58s]  All right, that's enough info.
[14987.58s -> 14993.62s]  Let's go.
[14993.62s -> 14994.76s]  That's three.
[14994.76s -> 14995.58s]  Perfect.
[14995.58s -> 14998.83s]  Three again.
[14998.83s -> 14999.99s]  All right.
[14999.99s -> 15000.99s]  Getting there.
[15000.99s -> 15004.50s]  Another three.
[15004.50s -> 15008.53s]  This is the six.
[15008.53s -> 15009.37s]  Perfect.
[15009.37s -> 15013.76s]  Five is gonna be right in the middle here.
[15013.76s -> 15022.04s]  Ooh, feels good.
[15022.04s -> 15026.09s]  Two, one, one, one, one.
[15026.09s -> 15028.70s]  There's eight.
[15028.70s -> 15032.94s]  Almost done.
[15032.94s -> 15039.16s]  Cool.
[15039.16s -> 15041.87s]  Two.
[15041.87s -> 15043.62s]  Yes.
[15043.62s -> 15044.46s]  Gotta be here.
[15044.46s -> 15045.28s]  Gotta be here.
[15045.28s -> 15046.12s]  Close it.
[15046.12s -> 15048.04s]  Close it.
[15048.04s -> 15049.66s]  There are four.
[15049.66s -> 15053.73s]  Hmm.
[15053.73s -> 15062.34s]  Has to be right here.
[15062.34s -> 15063.50s]  This is kind of freaking me out though.
[15063.50s -> 15064.58s]  So it's gonna be back this way.
[15064.58s -> 15067.10s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[15067.10s -> 15071.03s]  Maybe not.
[15071.03s -> 15079.38s]  Okay, so two, two.
[15079.38s -> 15081.47s]  Nice.
[15081.47s -> 15084.53s]  Almost done.
[15084.53s -> 15093.80s]  This is all filled in except the top rows here.
[15093.80s -> 15094.64s]  Hmm.
[15094.64s -> 15100.62s]  Interesting.
[15100.62s -> 15103.68s]  What is it?
[15103.68s -> 15105.84s]  CPU?
[15105.84s -> 15106.68s]  Chip?
[15106.68s -> 15109.18s]  Microchip.
[15109.18s -> 15112.34s]  Good work everybody.
[15112.34s -> 15113.18s]  And that's it.
[15113.18s -> 15114.89s]  I'm gonna call it here.
[15114.89s -> 15118.03s]  Thanks for watching this absolute mess
[15118.03s -> 15121.63s]  of a fucking live stream.
[15121.63s -> 15125.64s]  This is the third game.
[15125.64s -> 15128.48s]  Had some technical issues with the first one.
[15128.48s -> 15130.96s]  Second one was all right.
[15130.96s -> 15131.80s]  It was good.
[15131.80s -> 15134.86s]  I have nothing really bad to say about the second one
[15134.86s -> 15137.48s]  except for the fact that I'd rather just chill
[15137.48s -> 15142.10s]  and play Picross.
[15142.10s -> 15144.36s]  Tomorrow, VR.
[15144.36s -> 15147.46s]  We'll do a good four or five hours in VR tomorrow.
[15148.08s -> 15150.40s]  And then I'm gonna take the next few days off.
[15150.40s -> 15151.24s]  See you real soon.
[15151.24s -> 15152.92s]  Let's get to the bits and the subs.
[15152.92s -> 15155.28s]  Thank you guys for sticking around.
[15155.28s -> 15159.17s]  And again, sorry for a stream
[15159.17s -> 15160.61s]  that was all over the place.
[15160.61s -> 15163.51s]  Hope you still had fun.
[15163.51s -> 15168.44s]  Let's move on to the end.
[15168.44s -> 15169.54s]  Let's go.
[15169.54s -> 15177.58s]  What do you say?
[15177.58s -> 15179.73s]  All right.
[15179.73s -> 15184.06s]  See you tomorrow if you're taking off.
[15184.06s -> 15185.82s]  If you're not taking off,
[15185.82s -> 15188.34s]  we have a little bit of this to get through.
[15188.34s -> 15194.87s]  A whole lot, not a million.
[15194.87s -> 15199.06s]  Get some shit open.
[15199.06s -> 15200.46s]  Came to the last hour, but I had fun.
[15200.46s -> 15201.38s]  I'm glad to hear that.
[15201.38s -> 15203.22s]  Good.
[15203.22s -> 15204.06s]  What?
[15204.06s -> 15205.98s]  I think I'm about to close my Twitch window
[15205.98s -> 15208.02s]  when I had Audacity open somehow.
[15215.69s -> 15217.61s]  Let's open it back up, please.
[15227.64s -> 15231.47s]  Okay.
[15231.47s -> 15235.03s]  Cool, cool, cool.
[15235.03s -> 15236.87s]  So let's go back.
[15236.87s -> 15242.07s]  Earlier, about seven-ish hours ago,
[15242.07s -> 15248.78s]  we had a 250 from Lazy Luke.
[15248.78s -> 15252.08s]  No, this is yesterday.
[15252.08s -> 15253.67s]  Sorry.
[15253.67s -> 15254.49s]  I'm stupid.
[15254.95s -> 15255.79s]  Here we go.
[15255.79s -> 15258.08s]  Sad Vega, thanks for the three bucks.
[15258.08s -> 15261.66s]  Appreciate it.
[15261.66s -> 15263.46s]  Space Jenify part one, baby.
[15263.46s -> 15265.50s]  Woo, what a blast.
[15265.50s -> 15268.14s]  I'm making cheesy goji to Crunch Tacos homemade
[15268.14s -> 15269.54s]  and boy, they're good.
[15269.54s -> 15272.78s]  Also, did you up the cost of three to be read out loud
[15272.78s -> 15274.46s]  and we still doing the ones?
[15274.46s -> 15275.42s]  Very curious to know.
[15275.42s -> 15277.06s]  250.
[15277.06s -> 15279.02s]  I'm sorry that you were so excited for Space Jenify.
[15279.02s -> 15280.88s]  I was too.
[15280.88s -> 15281.96s]  Maybe I was doing something wrong.
[15281.96s -> 15283.12s]  I don't think I was though.
[15283.12s -> 15286.65s]  Something was going, something was wacky.
[15286.65s -> 15289.17s]  250 is the minimum for me to read.
[15290.13s -> 15292.65s]  And again, I wanna make sure I reiterate this too.
[15295.29s -> 15299.49s]  Just because you give 250 doesn't mean I'm going to read.
[15299.49s -> 15300.85s]  Obviously something that I still have to be
[15300.85s -> 15302.41s]  comfortable reading.
[15302.41s -> 15303.97s]  Maybe it's something that I don't really wanna address
[15303.97s -> 15307.98s]  or talk about, I may not address it.
[15307.98s -> 15309.54s]  And a lot of times, sometimes people even put
[15309.54s -> 15313.30s]  in their messages to not say these things.
[15313.30s -> 15317.93s]  So fair enough, fair enough, right.
[15317.93s -> 15318.89s]  But it's 250.
[15321.16s -> 15324.66s]  But again, it is also at my discretion.
[15325.54s -> 15326.38s]  He didn't answer if he ate ass.
[15326.38s -> 15331.06s]  I already did, I did.
[15331.06s -> 15333.86s]  But anyways, sad Vega.
[15333.86s -> 15334.70s]  Glad you're feeling better.
[15334.70s -> 15338.70s]  Also, whatever happened to Dr. A, Dr. Agon's,
[15338.70s -> 15340.30s]  Dragon's Dogma.
[15340.30s -> 15342.14s]  I was gonna try and play alongside you.
[15342.14s -> 15345.34s]  So you could have some pawns not named Poopypants
[15345.34s -> 15347.49s]  or awful things.
[15347.49s -> 15349.29s]  Hope we get back to that sometime soon.
[15349.29s -> 15354.42s]  Isn't the creator interested in making a new one?
[15354.42s -> 15358.79s]  I should have just played that today.
[15358.79s -> 15361.79s]  Well, I mean, P-Cross is just on the mind.
[15361.79s -> 15365.54s]  I probably should have just opened that today.
[15365.54s -> 15368.39s]  That would have been like a perfect opportunity.
[15368.39s -> 15371.10s]  Oops, oh well.
[15371.10s -> 15374.34s]  It's coming out on Switch, that's amazing.
[15374.34s -> 15375.70s]  But after Devil May Cry 5,
[15375.70s -> 15380.32s]  you're gonna make another one, right?
[15380.32s -> 15381.24s]  But thank you, sad Vega.
[15381.24s -> 15382.88s]  Thank you, Pro Star for the five bucks
[15382.88s -> 15386.24s]  with the John Halo Master Chief Collection coming to PC.
[15386.24s -> 15390.02s]  Do you think you'll play those games on Steam?
[15390.02s -> 15392.72s]  I'm gonna say no.
[15392.72s -> 15394.56s]  I don't think so.
[15394.56s -> 15396.48s]  Unless like people really wanna see that,
[15396.48s -> 15399.16s]  would you guys really wanna see me play Halo 1
[15399.16s -> 15400.00s]  on stream?
[15401.13s -> 15402.73s]  The story mode?
[15402.73s -> 15411.79s]  Is that something that people would wanna watch?
[15411.79s -> 15415.46s]  I feel like the Halo games are,
[15415.46s -> 15418.70s]  you know, just kind of shooters with the story.
[15421.69s -> 15425.77s]  I don't know if it's something I'd wanna stream.
[15425.77s -> 15429.23s]  They're great games, but just kind of a story shooter.
[15432.18s -> 15436.59s]  The multiplayer, are they turning on the multiplayer?
[15436.59s -> 15442.18s]  Like will Halo 2 be online on Steam?
[15442.18s -> 15443.22s]  Well, that's a big deal.
[15443.22s -> 15444.94s]  Okay, that's a big, I didn't know that they,
[15444.94s -> 15446.06s]  I thought maybe they were just gonna turn
[15446.06s -> 15450.09s]  the servers off or something.
[15450.09s -> 15452.41s]  I just, it's just the, oh, okay, that's it.
[15452.41s -> 15455.39s]  I might even just play the multiplayer for fun.
[15455.39s -> 15457.67s]  Community maps too, holy shit, that's amazing.
[15459.45s -> 15464.07s]  That's a lot of money.
[15464.07s -> 15470.66s]  Dye335 just gave $200, two, holy shit.
[15471.83s -> 15474.97s]  He just gave 20,000 bits.
[15474.97s -> 15478.30s]  He just dropped a gigantic bit bomb.
[15478.30s -> 15479.42s]  200 bucks.
[15481.05s -> 15483.79s]  Thank you, first of all, Dye.
[15483.79s -> 15485.55s]  Been watching your videos since before.
[15485.59s -> 15487.55s]  Twitch back in 2011, honest to God,
[15487.55s -> 15492.02s]  best streamer I've ever watched, that's, thank you.
[15497.23s -> 15499.03s]  Anytime anybody says something like that,
[15499.03s -> 15500.63s]  I always wanna try to do better.
[15505.50s -> 15506.94s]  That means an absolute fuck ton.
[15506.94s -> 15509.02s]  Thank you so much for the $200, Dye.
[15511.10s -> 15513.46s]  So much more money as well tonight.
[15513.46s -> 15515.94s]  There was so much money from other people.
[15517.87s -> 15523.18s]  50, 50, 50, 20, 20, 20, 30, 15, 15, 30, 30.
[15523.18s -> 15534.65s]  Thank you guys all so much, for real.
[15534.69s -> 15536.05s]  That's a shit load of money.
[15540.13s -> 15544.83s]  I am spoiled rotten.
[15544.83s -> 15551.66s]  I'm glad you think this stream is worth paying for.
[15551.66s -> 15554.51s]  I'm gonna keep trying to do better.
[15554.51s -> 15557.43s]  Very important point.
[15557.43s -> 15558.83s]  Can always strive to do better,
[15558.83s -> 15561.19s]  to try more, to do more things.
[15564.70s -> 15568.68s]  So I appreciate it.
[15568.68s -> 15570.52s]  Jess, you got it, thanks for the 250.
[15570.52s -> 15573.28s]  I think this was summarized history,
[15573.28s -> 15575.40s]  but it sounds like slam poetry.
[15575.40s -> 15576.40s]  What is it?
[15576.40s -> 15577.84s]  Something that I said?
[15577.88s -> 15579.08s]  War bad.
[15582.44s -> 15584.12s]  Spice trading.
[15584.12s -> 15587.86s]  Trade sugar, tobacco trading.
[15587.86s -> 15589.70s]  Economies, collapses.
[15592.98s -> 15598.12s]  Entrepreneurship, industry, steam.
[15598.12s -> 15600.36s]  Am I playing the $100,000 pyramid?
[15600.36s -> 15601.48s]  Natural gas.
[15601.48s -> 15603.28s]  What are we, what's going on?
[15603.28s -> 15606.14s]  England?
[15606.14s -> 15608.11s]  England.
[15608.11s -> 15608.95s]  England.
[15610.03s -> 15610.87s]  America.
[15610.87s -> 15612.07s]  Slam poetry.
[15612.07s -> 15613.83s]  America.
[15613.83s -> 15615.70s]  America.
[15615.82s -> 15617.02s]  Oh, that's the C-Man.
[15617.02s -> 15618.26s]  The C-Man stream, right.
[15618.26s -> 15624.95s]  Okay, I remember.
[15624.95s -> 15626.55s]  That sounds like something my English teacher would do.
[15626.55s -> 15629.45s]  You sure we're not the same person?
[15629.45s -> 15633.63s]  Thank you, Jess, you got it for the 250, and the clip.
[15633.63s -> 15635.31s]  Hey, Kristen, thanks for the five bucks.
[15635.31s -> 15637.27s]  Left, right, choo-choo, hey, hey, hey.
[15637.27s -> 15641.63s]  Left, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.
[15641.63s -> 15651.76s]  That's a pretty good summary of Space General 5 part one.
[15651.76s -> 15658.07s]  Thank you.
[15658.07s -> 15661.58s]  I'm sad that I couldn't really get that to go.
[15661.58s -> 15666.34s]  It was kind of futile.
[15666.34s -> 15668.06s]  I didn't want to give that game a bad name
[15668.06s -> 15670.50s]  because I love that series.
[15670.50s -> 15675.86s]  I just love that game.
[15675.86s -> 15681.05s]  It probably is the fact that I just didn't have a CRT.
[15681.05s -> 15682.53s]  On the bright side, the VR game you think
[15682.53s -> 15684.53s]  is a remake of part one.
[15684.53s -> 15686.57s]  Well, that actually, the cards all fall
[15686.57s -> 15688.84s]  in a perfect spot, if that's true.
[15688.84s -> 15690.78s]  So that's, we'll just play that.
[15695.57s -> 15696.41s]  Where are we?
[15696.41s -> 15698.47s]  I got lost here, there we are.
[15698.47s -> 15700.15s]  Hey, grapplemace, thanks for the 250.
[15700.15s -> 15702.87s]  Any chance of another stream like Picross?
[15702.87s -> 15704.51s]  I honestly loved it.
[15704.51s -> 15706.51s]  PS, where are the Pikachu socks?
[15706.51s -> 15709.11s]  We bought you for Christmas, BibleThump.
[15709.11s -> 15712.19s]  What a, grapplemace, that was six hours ago.
[15712.19s -> 15715.69s]  Any chance of another Picross stream?
[15715.69s -> 15719.40s]  Well, if you are still here, there you go.
[15719.40s -> 15723.16s]  If you're not here anymore and you might catch the Vod,
[15723.16s -> 15726.86s]  you're gonna be happy about that.
[15726.86s -> 15727.82s]  Thank you, though.
[15727.82s -> 15729.54s]  Thank you, Freudian Weapon.
[15729.54s -> 15731.66s]  I am here, thank you for Picross.
[15731.66s -> 15737.26s]  Thank you, grapplemace, for sticking around for that long.
[15737.26s -> 15739.51s]  Hope you liked the Picross.
[15739.51s -> 15742.23s]  And then Freudian Weapon of 250 from Freudian.
[15742.23s -> 15743.79s]  This game makes me want to dance.
[15743.79s -> 15746.50s]  I think the aliens are taking over my brain.
[15746.66s -> 15748.66s]  Nose wipe, yes.
[15748.66s -> 15750.65s]  They tend to do that.
[15750.65s -> 15757.42s]  They tend to do that.
[15757.42s -> 15760.80s]  We had, I'm getting, they moved.
[15760.80s -> 15763.00s]  We had a bunch of community subs tonight.
[15763.00s -> 15769.44s]  I think I missed some of them, too.
[15769.44s -> 15770.88s]  Let me see.
[15770.88s -> 15773.24s]  The Lake Drinker had five community subs.
[15777.49s -> 15778.81s]  Epic gave five community subs.
[15778.81s -> 15781.35s]  Kazzy, five community subs.
[15781.35s -> 15785.96s]  Thank you, guys.
[15785.96s -> 15790.94s]  Also Castillion, or Castalion, gave 10 bucks.
[15790.94s -> 15792.42s]  Hey, Gerber, sending my love from New Zealand.
[15792.42s -> 15794.34s]  It's been rough here, given what's happened.
[15794.34s -> 15795.30s]  But I just want to tell everyone
[15795.30s -> 15797.78s]  that they're good people and a great community.
[15797.78s -> 15801.89s]  Regards, a Kiwi fan.
[15801.89s -> 15805.62s]  That's absolutely fucking terrible what happened.
[15805.62s -> 15808.34s]  Actually, last night I was just kind of reading up on it.
[15808.34s -> 15820.60s]  And it's just fucking terrible.
[15820.60s -> 15825.08s]  Yeah, this shit is absolutely heartbreaking.
[15825.08s -> 15828.00s]  It's one of those scenarios where you just wish
[15828.00s -> 15830.27s]  that shit wasn't real.
[15830.27s -> 15833.34s]  Just sitting there in bed last night,
[15833.34s -> 15834.86s]  just going over, reading on my iPad,
[15834.86s -> 15836.94s]  different things, and just seeing what happened.
[15836.98s -> 15841.50s]  Because last night it was, somebody mentioned it.
[15841.50s -> 15842.46s]  I didn't even know what happened.
[15842.46s -> 15847.30s]  And then just, you're lying down,
[15847.30s -> 15848.46s]  you're just sitting there staring at the ceiling,
[15848.46s -> 15854.78s]  just going like, why the fuck is this shit real?
[15854.78s -> 15862.16s]  Absolutely fucking horrible tragedy.
[15862.16s -> 15867.61s]  But thank you so much, Castillion.
[15867.61s -> 15869.37s]  Thank you for 10 dollars.
[15869.37s -> 15882.93s]  And stay safe.
[15882.93s -> 15884.01s]  And you read more about it today.
[15884.01s -> 15887.75s]  That's why it's just, it's so,
[15887.75s -> 15893.36s]  it's just such an awful fucking feeling.
[15893.40s -> 15896.16s]  I just wish people were fucking better to each other.
[15896.16s -> 15900.42s]  Really.
[15900.42s -> 15910.23s]  It's awful, awful shit.
[15910.23s -> 15920.14s]  But regardless, we're gonna move on from that.
[15920.14s -> 15922.94s]  Thank you again, Castillion, and again.
[15922.94s -> 15924.10s]  Stay safe, all of you.
[15924.10s -> 15931.84s]  That goes for everybody.
[15931.84s -> 15933.28s]  And right after that, there was,
[15933.28s -> 15936.46s]  there was 150 dollars thrown in here
[15936.46s -> 15938.66s]  from something or other, Juno, SEPTO,
[15938.66s -> 15942.20s]  something or other, they gave 100 bucks.
[15942.20s -> 15946.44s]  Just dropping, just huge stacks of money on this stream.
[15947.00s -> 15949.96s]  It's, thank you, guys.
[15949.96s -> 15950.96s]  Thank you, thank you, thank you
[15950.96s -> 15956.38s]  from the bottom of my fucking heart.
[15956.38s -> 15959.12s]  That's a lot of money.
[15959.12s -> 15960.96s]  And La Cranda, 100 bucks.
[15960.96s -> 15963.28s]  I just forgot how much money was back here.
[15963.28s -> 15964.28s]  La Cranda, 100 bucks.
[15964.28s -> 15967.32s]  Smashly, 50 bucks.
[15967.32s -> 15979.00s]  Jesus.
[15979.00s -> 15981.20s]  You guys are, you guys are too much.
[15981.20s -> 15987.11s]  Really.
[15987.11s -> 15987.95s]  Hydrate.
[15989.15s -> 15990.59s]  I'm good, I got one here.
[15990.59s -> 15993.51s]  When the stream's over, I'll go get something to drink.
[15993.51s -> 15994.35s]  To drink.
[15997.10s -> 15999.78s]  100's not 100 bucks, but any amount of money
[16000.74s -> 16001.58s]  that somebody gives the stream is appreciated.
[16001.58s -> 16002.94s]  I wanna make that really clear.
[16002.94s -> 16005.50s]  I know that some people say, no, 250.
[16005.50s -> 16008.22s]  Oh, that's, he's increasing the bids.
[16008.22s -> 16009.06s]  What if he does it again?
[16009.06s -> 16010.22s]  What if he does it again?
[16010.22s -> 16016.38s]  If you give a cent, it's wildly appreciated.
[16016.38s -> 16018.34s]  I don't want it to be one of those goal posts
[16018.34s -> 16019.98s]  that I keep moving like, yeah, come on out here.
[16019.98s -> 16023.78s]  You wanna say something, that'll be fucking 10 bucks.
[16023.78s -> 16024.62s]  That's not the intention.
[16024.62s -> 16025.46s]  That's not why I'm doing it.
[16025.46s -> 16028.35s]  That's not why I did it.
[16028.35s -> 16029.69s]  You can't give a cent.
[16029.69s -> 16032.73s]  Right, oh yeah, that is because if one cent,
[16032.73s -> 16034.45s]  yeah, all right, hold on.
[16034.45s -> 16037.61s]  If you have one cent on bids,
[16037.61s -> 16039.57s]  somebody can put a quarter down
[16039.57s -> 16043.18s]  and just spam the chat with one cent donations.
[16043.18s -> 16049.82s]  So that's why it's 25 cent minimum.
[16049.82s -> 16053.18s]  If like 50 people bought a dollar
[16053.18s -> 16057.31s]  and then all of them just spammed one cent cheers,
[16057.31s -> 16064.33s]  it would just be like, it would just be a mess.
[16064.33s -> 16067.13s]  But he appreciates every one of those 25 cents.
[16067.13s -> 16069.25s]  That's right, if you give one cent,
[16069.25s -> 16077.86s]  doesn't even know his own rules, but thank you.
[16077.90s -> 16082.07s]  I've seen it happen, it's not pretty.
[16082.07s -> 16085.13s]  Yes, that's true.
[16085.13s -> 16087.21s]  We got Alf the librarian, thanks with 250.
[16087.21s -> 16088.97s]  So I couldn't find a book
[16088.97s -> 16090.45s]  because one of the richest men in the world
[16090.45s -> 16092.62s]  already bought 50 copies.
[16092.62s -> 16095.10s]  But do you want a history of the Dreamcast book?
[16095.10s -> 16099.34s]  I already got one right here.
[16099.34s -> 16104.02s]  It's the manual, it's everything I need to know.
[16104.02s -> 16105.90s]  If you give him one cent, he tells you to fuck off.
[16105.90s -> 16108.75s]  Oh, I don't.
[16108.75s -> 16109.91s]  Hey, thank you, Bebraham.
[16109.91s -> 16112.30s]  You gave 10 community subs earlier.
[16112.30s -> 16116.58s]  Thank you.
[16116.58s -> 16122.37s]  Another $50, I forgot how much fucking, oh my Jesus.
[16125.82s -> 16131.02s]  Natikins gave 50, a hundred, right?
[16131.02s -> 16132.94s]  How many, a hundred bucks, how many?
[16132.94s -> 16144.30s]  My God, a hundred bucks.
[16144.30s -> 16146.81s]  Jesus.
[16146.81s -> 16149.41s]  Thank you Tiss Chaboy for the 10 bucks.
[16149.41s -> 16150.53s]  Jerma, you're my favorite streamer.
[16150.53s -> 16152.89s]  I've never left a streamer video without laughing.
[16152.89s -> 16153.97s]  My ass off.
[16153.97s -> 16154.89s]  Been watching for years.
[16154.89s -> 16155.97s]  I'm sorry this isn't much,
[16155.97s -> 16158.29s]  but it's the amount I can afford.
[16158.29s -> 16164.29s]  Love you, Jerma Jerma Hart.
[16164.29s -> 16169.57s]  I've said it before, just you being here is enough.
[16169.57s -> 16172.54s]  Now this, I don't have this without you watching.
[16172.58s -> 16179.62s]  So you guys are way more important.
[16179.62s -> 16182.26s]  Money is not as important as you hanging out
[16182.26s -> 16187.26s]  and having a good time and enjoying this shit.
[16191.96s -> 16194.38s]  Thank you.
[16194.38s -> 16195.98s]  Somebody said about the socks.
[16195.98s -> 16200.36s]  Yeah, they got lost in the mill.
[16200.36s -> 16207.79s]  I can't even, I can't say that anymore.
[16207.79s -> 16209.11s]  I'll tell you the truth.
[16209.11s -> 16217.45s]  Jerma the liar, somebody stole them, bought them.
[16217.45s -> 16221.97s]  They got sent to the door and somebody spiked them.
[16223.06s -> 16225.66s]  Yeah, it's fucked up.
[16225.66s -> 16235.66s]  I don't know, somebody stole them from me.
[16235.66s -> 16240.06s]  Oh, that's fucked up.
[16240.06s -> 16244.32s]  You want me to make another video?
[16244.32s -> 16246.72s]  I just like, every time I go to like buy them,
[16246.72s -> 16248.92s]  something comes up, like I hear like a fire alarm
[16248.92s -> 16249.76s]  goes off, right?
[16249.76s -> 16251.68s]  When I get, I'm hovering over purchase
[16251.68s -> 16254.36s]  and it's just, I gotta get out of here.
[16254.36s -> 16255.76s]  The fire alarm's going off.
[16255.76s -> 16261.68s]  It happens every time.
[16261.68s -> 16262.88s]  You want me to buy you a new pair?
[16262.88s -> 16264.08s]  No, this way.
[16264.08s -> 16268.52s]  I got a plan for that by the way.
[16268.52s -> 16271.04s]  That says I'm doing a bit voice.
[16271.04s -> 16273.00s]  That's the problem when you broadcast yourself
[16273.00s -> 16277.14s]  and record yourself hundreds of trillions of times.
[16277.14s -> 16279.54s]  That I can't sneak anything.
[16279.54s -> 16281.02s]  Oh, I wonder if what he's saying is true.
[16281.02s -> 16282.70s]  You've heard every cadence.
[16282.70s -> 16284.82s]  You've heard every one of my mannerisms.
[16284.82s -> 16287.98s]  I can't pretend, I can't lie to anybody here.
[16287.98s -> 16294.41s]  Even if I wanted to, it'd be impossible.
[16294.41s -> 16297.43s]  Sue, what the hell, what are you linking here?
[16297.43s -> 16301.80s]  What is this?
[16301.80s -> 16303.32s]  Jerma985 revelation.
[16303.32s -> 16310.26s]  Oh no, this, oh yeah, we watched that.
[16310.26s -> 16314.57s]  You go to get expanded, but it's all good.
[16314.57s -> 16319.22s]  I got a plan for those socks and the whale.
[16319.22s -> 16321.22s]  But thank you, Tissueboy.
[16321.22s -> 16325.04s]  Thank you, Dorkcube for the 250.
[16325.04s -> 16329.58s]  Thank you.
[16329.58s -> 16335.96s]  You say, I can't give you 50 dollars like these other guys.
[16335.96s -> 16337.84s]  I should feel bad about that, right?
[16337.84s -> 16343.16s]  That I can't give you more money.
[16343.16s -> 16350.22s]  Yet you're, I know you're baiting me here.
[16350.22s -> 16351.10s]  I'm not gonna take the bait,
[16351.10s -> 16352.62s]  but I'm gonna tell you thanks for the 250
[16352.62s -> 16361.46s]  and you don't have to give 50 dollars.
[16361.46s -> 16362.62s]  Speaking of 50 dollars, thank you,
[16362.62s -> 16367.51s]  Communist Taco for the 50 dollars.
[16367.51s -> 16369.23s]  Maybe I will try the PlayStation 2 version
[16369.27s -> 16370.11s]  or I'll just wait for the VR.
[16370.11s -> 16378.02s]  The VR one's coming out soon, right?
[16378.02s -> 16382.02s]  I feel like the VR one will just be better anyways.
[16382.02s -> 16387.50s]  Something or other thanks to the 250, you like pickles.
[16387.50s -> 16389.69s]  Yeah, I do.
[16389.69s -> 16392.59s]  I like pickles, they taste good.
[16392.59s -> 16395.19s]  I don't like sweet pickles, I like dill pickles.
[16395.19s -> 16396.93s]  And they gotta be crunchy.
[16396.93s -> 16399.57s]  None of these slippery bin inside
[16399.57s -> 16401.53s]  of an old lady's mouth for 30 seconds
[16401.53s -> 16405.49s]  smeared out of their mouth and put into your sandwich.
[16405.49s -> 16410.72s]  No, I want like the crunch, the snap pickles.
[16410.72s -> 16411.56s]  The ones that have like,
[16411.56s -> 16416.28s]  not the ones that have water all over them.
[16416.28s -> 16419.73s]  Sweet pickles I don't like at all.
[16419.73s -> 16423.67s]  Was that a meme with Drake?
[16423.67s -> 16426.58s]  Sweet pickles like, no, no, no, no.
[16426.58s -> 16434.98s]  Dill pickles, that's the one, pointin', right?
[16434.98s -> 16440.45s]  That'll get like a thousand upvotes on Reddit somewhere.
[16440.45s -> 16442.49s]  It doesn't matter if it's like a bad reference.
[16442.49s -> 16446.50s]  That's a terrible shit, like dog shit post meme,
[16446.50s -> 16454.28s]  but it probably will get clicks.
[16454.28s -> 16456.00s]  Pickles need to be soaked to become pickles.
[16456.00s -> 16456.92s]  Yeah, but then you take them out of the jar
[16456.92s -> 16458.08s]  and you wrap them in paper towels
[16458.08s -> 16460.86s]  and you squeeze, squish, crush, squish, crush,
[16460.86s -> 16462.93s]  unwrap, and they're dry.
[16462.93s -> 16464.09s]  Sure they might have a couple of hairs on them,
[16464.09s -> 16467.26s]  but you know you eat three inches of ass
[16467.26s -> 16471.49s]  every year anyways from meals.
[16471.49s -> 16475.65s]  Thank you, rise, fall of Ziggy Stardust for the 10 bucks.
[16475.65s -> 16477.81s]  Here's 10 great British pence.
[16477.81s -> 16479.89s]  In return I ask, do you eat ass?
[16479.89s -> 16488.38s]  Oh, pretty good timing on me reading this,
[16488.38s -> 16490.66s]  but thank you for the 10 bucks.
[16490.66s -> 16497.34s]  I've answered it already.
[16497.34s -> 16498.78s]  Thank you, Tishyboy for the $5.
[16498.78s -> 16499.98s]  Can you check the subs you missed?
[16499.98s -> 16503.54s]  Those people deserve acknowledgement for their bravery.
[16503.54s -> 16505.94s]  Yeah, well, if you're new,
[16505.94s -> 16509.89s]  I run a sub credits at the end of the stream.
[16509.89s -> 16512.21s]  Shows everybody's name on stream, on screen,
[16512.21s -> 16514.47s]  that sub during the stream.
[16514.47s -> 16522.02s]  I've found it's a very, it's a good system it seems,
[16522.02s -> 16527.23s]  but thank you for the $5, Tishyboy, appreciate it.
[16527.23s -> 16528.39s]  Pigeon, thanks for the 250.
[16528.39s -> 16529.79s]  I'm happy to report that my profile
[16529.79s -> 16531.35s]  on this community has received an A.
[16531.35s -> 16533.65s]  You got a 94% on that paper.
[16533.65s -> 16538.38s]  The professor marked me off for no quotes from you.
[16538.38s -> 16540.78s]  Dad, I told you I had to use a quote.
[16540.78s -> 16541.62s]  What did I say?
[16541.62s -> 16542.46s]  Eat vegetables and shit?
[16542.46s -> 16545.49s]  You could have just put it in there.
[16545.49s -> 16547.05s]  You could have just put it at the very end.
[16547.05s -> 16550.09s]  By the way, and like leave like a hyperlink to a clip
[16550.09s -> 16551.57s]  of me saying, eat your vegetables,
[16551.57s -> 16553.38s]  like good luck on your paper.
[16553.38s -> 16559.74s]  And he would have been like, what the fuck?
[16559.74s -> 16564.73s]  Well, congrats on the paper.
[16564.73s -> 16566.85s]  94%, you should be proud of that.
[16566.85s -> 16575.50s]  That's a very good job.
[16575.50s -> 16577.42s]  Appreciate the 250.
[16577.42s -> 16579.50s]  And then we had the Cremator, thanks for three bucks.
[16579.50s -> 16580.46s]  You asked about games to play.
[16580.46s -> 16582.54s]  What about Grand Theft Auto 2?
[16582.54s -> 16585.90s]  It's free on Steam.
[16585.90s -> 16594.60s]  GTA 2 is free on Steam?
[16594.60s -> 16598.26s]  Is that true?
[16598.26s -> 16606.22s]  Am I getting baited or is that actually real?
[16606.22s -> 16607.84s]  Free?
[16607.84s -> 16612.63s]  I don't know.
[16612.63s -> 16615.92s]  It was free for some time now, really.
[16615.92s -> 16616.88s]  You can't buy it.
[16616.88s -> 16620.61s]  No, I don't know.
[16620.61s -> 16624.62s]  I'm really drunk.
[16624.62s -> 16627.94s]  Well, drink some water.
[16627.94s -> 16634.42s]  But thank you for the three bucks.
[16634.42s -> 16636.19s]  Appreciate it.
[16636.19s -> 16638.27s]  Rise and fall of Stardust.
[16638.27s -> 16639.19s]  Thanks for the $5.
[16639.19s -> 16641.83s]  I don't know what this is.
[16641.83s -> 16643.23s]  This looks like Morse code.
[16646.71s -> 16648.19s]  I don't know what this is,
[16648.19s -> 16649.47s]  but thank you for the $5
[16649.47s -> 16654.80s]  and thanks for the Morse code.
[16654.80s -> 16656.12s]  It's not Morse code though.
[16656.16s -> 16658.21s]  It's something else.
[16658.21s -> 16663.21s]  This actually might be the top portion of an ASCII art
[16664.29s -> 16665.69s]  that they maybe tried to put the whole thing in
[16665.69s -> 16666.97s]  and it just auto-deleted everything
[16666.97s -> 16668.13s]  because there's only a certain amount of characters
[16668.13s -> 16672.27s]  you can put through to Streamlabs.
[16672.27s -> 16674.97s]  Maybe.
[16674.97s -> 16675.89s]  I don't know.
[16675.89s -> 16677.49s]  It's hard to tell.
[16677.49s -> 16678.93s]  But thank you for the $5.
[16682.22s -> 16684.54s]  Thank you to three bucks Cremator again.
[16686.91s -> 16689.76s]  I don't know if I don't wanna take,
[16689.76s -> 16691.40s]  I'm not gonna click on that link.
[16691.40s -> 16692.96s]  I don't wanna see what happened to your hand.
[16692.96s -> 16700.06s]  Hopefully you're okay.
[16700.10s -> 16701.80s]  Hopefully you're all right.
[16701.80s -> 16706.18s]  Whatever happened to you.
[16706.18s -> 16708.54s]  Hey, thank you DeusMorte for the 250.
[16708.54s -> 16709.50s]  If you like Picross,
[16709.50s -> 16713.82s]  there's a cool one on the DS called Picross 3D
[16713.82s -> 16715.46s]  where you start with a cube and uncover an object
[16715.46s -> 16717.02s]  within using the Picross number system
[16717.02s -> 16718.42s]  you might be interested.
[16718.42s -> 16720.53s]  I think I owned that.
[16720.53s -> 16722.57s]  I owned two Picross games for 3D.
[16722.57s -> 16728.17s]  Yes.
[16728.17s -> 16729.09s]  One of them was normal.
[16729.09s -> 16734.03s]  The other one was a 3D one if I remember.
[16734.03s -> 16734.87s]  That's cool though.
[16734.87s -> 16736.46s]  Maybe I'll check that out.
[16736.46s -> 16741.56s]  That'd be cool to have for a stream.
[16741.56s -> 16743.08s]  Hey, thank you DorkCube for the 250.
[16743.08s -> 16743.92s]  Oh my God.
[16743.92s -> 16746.76s]  I have a story to one up the Oreos in mom's bed.
[16746.76s -> 16749.89s]  I don't even care that it was a dream.
[16749.89s -> 16752.46s]  Yeah, but that's not,
[16752.46s -> 16753.94s]  it wasn't a real story.
[16753.94s -> 16756.02s]  It was me telling you a dream I had.
[16756.02s -> 16757.26s]  That didn't happen.
[16757.26s -> 16759.18s]  I actually threw up in my mother's bed.
[16759.18s -> 16766.67s]  That is a real story, not a dream.
[16766.67s -> 16768.31s]  Thank you Alpha Librarian for the 250.
[16768.31s -> 16769.71s]  Turns out you need to sign
[16769.71s -> 16775.21s]  an ultimate gaming question sheet for the book.
[16775.21s -> 16778.58s]  You can get the book for 20% off.
[16778.58s -> 16782.53s]  No, that's all good.
[16782.53s -> 16783.69s]  I don't need any books.
[16783.69s -> 16784.53s]  I got plenty of them.
[16784.53s -> 16786.22s]  I read a lot.
[16786.22s -> 16789.89s]  12 books a month at the end of the year.
[16789.89s -> 16791.85s]  Ferodian Weapon again, $50.
[16791.85s -> 16796.14s]  A lot of fucking money.
[16796.14s -> 16799.17s]  A lot.
[16799.17s -> 16804.98s]  DorkCube, thanks for the 250.
[16804.98s -> 16806.14s]  This may be an odd question,
[16806.14s -> 16807.78s]  but I just listened to a podcast earlier
[16807.78s -> 16809.46s]  that reminded me of the topic.
[16809.46s -> 16812.06s]  Did you listen to Ska when you were younger?
[16812.06s -> 16820.95s]  Ska, does the Mighty Mighty Bossstones count?
[16820.95s -> 16827.63s]  That's close, kind of, but not really, right?
[16827.63s -> 16831.10s]  Yes, I loved the Mighty Mighty Bossstones.
[16831.10s -> 16833.06s]  The Mighty Mighty Bossstones were my favorite band
[16833.06s -> 16835.16s]  when I was 14, 15.
[16835.16s -> 16839.20s]  Maybe even a little younger, like 13.
[16839.20s -> 16841.12s]  You look like a Ska listener.
[16841.12s -> 16847.02s]  What does that mean?
[16847.02s -> 16850.30s]  I remember being on the bus to a field trip
[16850.30s -> 16852.14s]  and listening to the whole CD twice
[16852.14s -> 16854.20s]  because it was a long drive.
[16854.20s -> 16858.34s]  I had a Walkman with one of those discs,
[16858.34s -> 16868.94s]  disc players, it was great.
[16868.94s -> 16872.76s]  And back then, the biggest technology was making sure
[16872.76s -> 16875.84s]  that if you grabbed or moved the Walkman,
[16875.84s -> 16876.68s]  that it didn't...
[16878.49s -> 16879.53s]  That was a huge technology.
[16879.53s -> 16882.41s]  Non-skippable discs would mean you could pick it up,
[16882.41s -> 16884.05s]  you could put it in your pocket.
[16884.05s -> 16888.41s]  If you went on a bump in the car, it didn't skip,
[16888.41s -> 16889.73s]  it buffered.
[16889.73s -> 16895.04s]  First, by the way, first ever form of buffering
[16895.04s -> 16899.69s]  was CDs having the no skip feature.
[16899.69s -> 16901.99s]  It would almost download and prepare,
[16901.99s -> 16908.58s]  buffer, you could even say, two or three seconds ahead.
[16908.58s -> 16910.62s]  Somebody made a million dollars with that
[16910.62s -> 16913.76s]  because then that turned into buffering.
[16913.76s -> 16920.35s]  Fucking Bob buffer, nice job.
[16920.35s -> 16922.33s]  But yeah, Mighty Mighty Bossstones.
[16922.37s -> 16924.66s]  Hey, C4G, thanks for the 250.
[16924.66s -> 16925.90s]  Hey, Germany, do you have any VR games
[16925.90s -> 16927.62s]  you'd most recommend from the ones you've played?
[16927.62s -> 16928.78s]  Absolutely.
[16928.78s -> 16932.30s]  I have Beat Saber and Superhot and they slap.
[16932.30s -> 16933.94s]  Also, please say something really funny here
[16933.94s -> 16936.06s]  so people clip it so I can find this easily
[16936.06s -> 16940.15s]  when I wake up tomorrow, thank you.
[16940.15s -> 16945.20s]  Do you want to do the horn?
[16945.20s -> 16946.76s]  Somebody will clip that, it's gonna be like horn
[16946.76s -> 16952.20s]  and then you'll be, there it is.
[16952.20s -> 16955.54s]  But Superhot VR is probably,
[16955.54s -> 16958.10s]  I would say in the top five for sure.
[16958.10s -> 16961.78s]  Blade and Sorcery was really, really great.
[16964.16s -> 16967.79s]  Pavlov is probably the best game
[16967.79s -> 16969.37s]  that you can play for multiplayer, I think,
[16969.37s -> 16975.86s]  at least what I've played so far.
[16975.86s -> 16979.32s]  If you haven't played Blade and Sorcery, it's fantastic.
[16979.32s -> 16980.68s]  Pavlov, again.
[16984.53s -> 16990.89s]  Even like Climie, Climie was really fun too.
[16990.89s -> 16996.58s]  Very simple, but there's workshop support.
[16996.58s -> 16998.58s]  But we'll see, maybe my opinion changes tomorrow
[16998.58s -> 17000.34s]  because there's another three or four games in VR
[17000.34s -> 17003.82s]  I'm gonna play tomorrow.
[17003.82s -> 17007.80s]  We should have a great time, looking forward to it.
[17007.80s -> 17011.32s]  Oh, Dread Halls, that's right.
[17011.32s -> 17012.34s]  If you like horror games,
[17012.38s -> 17017.10s]  Dread Halls is probably the best one for VR.
[17017.10s -> 17023.13s]  Does not, do you think there would be a shitload of them?
[17023.13s -> 17028.57s]  Dread Halls, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[17028.57s -> 17029.81s]  The bar fight game was funny,
[17029.81s -> 17035.98s]  but it's really only like 30 to 40 minutes.
[17035.98s -> 17037.30s]  You don't get like an entire experience.
[17037.30s -> 17038.82s]  It's like a 25 minute experience
[17038.82s -> 17039.74s]  to punch people in the face
[17039.74s -> 17042.51s]  and throw chairs at people.
[17042.51s -> 17046.51s]  Hot Dogs, Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades
[17046.51s -> 17048.96s]  is another good one.
[17048.96s -> 17053.72s]  If you like simulated weaponry and a million different axes
[17053.72s -> 17055.72s]  and there's like a sniper rifles
[17056.68s -> 17058.04s]  and like the range,
[17058.04s -> 17062.99s]  there's all kinds of stuff in that game.
[17062.99s -> 17064.99s]  Did I see the tweet by Twitch about Dread Halls?
[17064.99s -> 17068.90s]  I did, yeah, it's funny.
[17068.90s -> 17070.66s]  It's funny, they like, they bleeped out the swears
[17070.66s -> 17073.13s]  and they like cut me out.
[17073.13s -> 17073.97s]  They like, yeah, get this,
[17073.97s -> 17075.75s]  I don't, we don't want his like big,
[17075.75s -> 17077.19s]  ugly, gross body in here.
[17077.19s -> 17084.90s]  We just want like the, with the joke.
[17084.90s -> 17088.98s]  Yeah, the official Twitch Twitter
[17088.98s -> 17094.00s]  did a little, nice little shout out on their Twitter.
[17094.00s -> 17101.09s]  It was really cool, pretty cool.
[17101.09s -> 17103.13s]  But let's keep going, almost done.
[17103.13s -> 17106.78s]  We got just a little bit to go through.
[17106.78s -> 17109.42s]  It's time for slime, thanks to the three bucks.
[17109.42s -> 17111.70s]  Hello, Jerma, please activate that cool gamer loot
[17111.70s -> 17114.61s]  in stream legends.
[17114.61s -> 17121.19s]  You got it.
[17121.19s -> 17127.02s]  What level is the guild?
[17127.02s -> 17135.88s]  Are we, have we taken over anything yet?
[17135.88s -> 17136.70s]  All right, you ready?
[17136.70s -> 17139.16s]  I don't know if you have to have it open or not.
[17139.16s -> 17141.20s]  Level 38.
[17141.20s -> 17143.50s]  All right, if you want it, get it open.
[17143.50s -> 17144.78s]  I'm not sure if you,
[17144.78s -> 17148.18s]  maybe you have to have it open or not.
[17148.18s -> 17152.88s]  Three, two, one, here you go.
[17152.88s -> 17156.78s]  Remind me to do that again tomorrow.
[17156.78s -> 17157.90s]  Because if people are having fun with that
[17157.90s -> 17159.86s]  and it's just something interesting little idle thing
[17159.86s -> 17161.10s]  that they do for fun,
[17161.10s -> 17169.45s]  then yeah, just always remind me to do that.
[17169.45s -> 17170.81s]  But thank you, it's time for slime.
[17170.81s -> 17174.01s]  Hope you enjoy your free stuff.
[17174.01s -> 17177.08s]  Hey, C4G, thanks for the $5 here.
[17177.08s -> 17180.70s]  Also, Minecraft VR is honestly pretty good
[17180.70s -> 17182.50s]  as long as you liked Minecraft to begin with.
[17182.50s -> 17185.30s]  The cows are too big, so they're kind of scary
[17185.30s -> 17187.34s]  and you get nauseous like really easy.
[17187.34s -> 17194.74s]  So you know what I changed my mind, it sucks.
[17194.74s -> 17197.60s]  Also, Hatsune Miku VR sucks,
[17197.60s -> 17200.06s]  which is the same because I love Miku,
[17200.06s -> 17201.90s]  but it's not worth $25.
[17201.90s -> 17206.73s]  Okay, I'm out of bits, bye.
[17206.77s -> 17212.90s]  What is Hatsune Miku VR?
[17212.90s -> 17217.02s]  Isn't, wait, isn't Hatsune Miku the pop star,
[17217.02s -> 17224.38s]  the animated pop star thing?
[17224.38s -> 17225.30s]  Oh, okay.
[17225.30s -> 17232.70s]  Well, I'm sorry that you didn't think it was worth it.
[17232.70s -> 17233.52s]  He doesn't know.
[17233.52s -> 17236.83s]  I mean, I do, I just told you what it was.
[17236.83s -> 17240.36s]  I just said what it is.
[17240.36s -> 17242.34s]  Miku and Jerma collab when?
[17242.34s -> 17243.92s]  I don't know.
[17243.92s -> 17245.92s]  I don't do collabs.
[17245.92s -> 17248.78s]  Or organically we'll hang out with somebody
[17248.78s -> 17253.34s]  and maybe we'll do something together.
[17253.34s -> 17256.93s]  He doesn't know.
[17256.93s -> 17258.92s]  Get the Miku game.
[17258.92s -> 17268.40s]  I don't think so.
[17268.40s -> 17271.92s]  Thank you, Genny, Benny for the three bucks.
[17271.92s -> 17273.76s]  Jerma, you're telling me your Sega is dead.
[17273.76s -> 17275.62s]  He overheated.
[17275.62s -> 17276.46s]  It's dead.
[17276.46s -> 17280.39s]  No, it's fine.
[17280.39s -> 17281.43s]  That's the first Dreamcast game
[17281.43s -> 17285.04s]  that I had a problem with.
[17285.04s -> 17290.24s]  So I don't know.
[17290.24s -> 17292.78s]  It was weird that the background wasn't there.
[17292.78s -> 17294.50s]  Scenes were disappearing.
[17294.50s -> 17297.26s]  The game, remember the game just locked up?
[17297.26s -> 17299.30s]  That was really weird.
[17299.30s -> 17302.82s]  They were just standing there and she was blinking.
[17302.82s -> 17303.94s]  That was odd,
[17303.94s -> 17307.54s]  but maybe it was a problem with the Dreamcast.
[17307.58s -> 17309.02s]  I don't think so.
[17309.02s -> 17309.86s]  Fucking bootleg.
[17309.86s -> 17314.68s]  I can't believe it if that's true.
[17314.68s -> 17317.70s]  I made such a big deal about opening that wrapper and shit.
[17317.70s -> 17319.14s]  People are probably talking so much shit
[17319.14s -> 17320.60s]  and laughing their ass off
[17320.60s -> 17321.44s]  at the fact that I'm like,
[17321.44s -> 17324.92s]  oh, look in the wrapper, cool.
[17324.92s -> 17332.07s]  It's like a bootleg fucking disc.
[17332.07s -> 17333.09s]  What?
[17333.09s -> 17338.33s]  80 year old.
[17338.33s -> 17341.89s]  We all get scammed once in a while.
[17341.89s -> 17344.21s]  Thank you, Pika Banana for the $10.31.
[17344.21s -> 17345.51s]  That wasn't a boring stream.
[17345.51s -> 17347.29s]  We're here for you, not the games.
[17347.29s -> 17348.33s]  All the crazy games you play
[17348.33s -> 17351.79s]  wouldn't be as fun to watch without you, Jerma Hart.
[17352.75s -> 17356.64s]  I really appreciate that.
[17356.64s -> 17359.64s]  I do.
[17359.64s -> 17363.63s]  But still, I want each stream to be fun.
[17363.63s -> 17364.83s]  I want people to not go,
[17364.83s -> 17365.87s]  oh, here we go again.
[17365.87s -> 17366.99s]  Or, well, this sucked.
[17366.99s -> 17369.26s]  Oh yeah, that was bad.
[17369.26s -> 17370.20s]  Even if that's the case,
[17370.20s -> 17373.62s]  I know I never want that to happen.
[17373.62s -> 17376.70s]  I want each broadcast to be as good as the last one,
[17376.70s -> 17377.98s]  as good as the one that was a week ago,
[17377.98s -> 17383.52s]  as good as the one that was a month ago.
[17383.52s -> 17385.00s]  And it's not, I'm not really,
[17385.00s -> 17385.82s]  I'm fine.
[17385.82s -> 17386.98s]  Like I had a blast.
[17386.98s -> 17392.56s]  Things were fun.
[17392.56s -> 17393.58s]  I wasn't upset or anything.
[17393.58s -> 17395.91s]  It's not like I'm mad.
[17395.91s -> 17399.15s]  It's just, you know what I want?
[17399.15s -> 17401.11s]  I want it to go the way that I want it.
[17401.11s -> 17403.24s]  And when it doesn't,
[17403.24s -> 17408.93s]  it can be like, like shit.
[17408.93s -> 17410.77s]  Was the whole stream picked across?
[17410.77s -> 17412.88s]  No.
[17412.88s -> 17413.84s]  We only went to picked across.
[17413.84s -> 17416.78s]  That's not even a pick cross
[17416.78s -> 17422.95s]  because of the technical problems I had with the Dreamcast.
[17422.95s -> 17426.89s]  Kind of threw everything out of whack.
[17426.89s -> 17428.32s]  But it's all right.
[17428.32s -> 17431.27s]  We move on, we play, we do it again tomorrow.
[17431.27s -> 17433.84s]  I still had a lot of fun on this stream.
[17433.84s -> 17439.72s]  I had fun on pretty much every stream.
[17439.72s -> 17441.12s]  I had a lot of fun on the last stream
[17441.12s -> 17442.16s]  from yesterday, you know?
[17442.16s -> 17446.38s]  It's, I don't, I'm not like giving points
[17446.38s -> 17447.86s]  and taking points away per stream.
[17447.86s -> 17449.06s]  Like, oh, that one was an eight.
[17449.06s -> 17449.98s]  That one was an eight.
[17449.98s -> 17450.82s]  That was a seven.
[17450.82s -> 17453.51s]  That was a two.
[17453.51s -> 17457.13s]  I just want them to go well.
[17457.13s -> 17460.20s]  Right?
[17460.20s -> 17461.76s]  Modest Narcissists,
[17461.76s -> 17465.63s]  thanks for the $10.
[17465.63s -> 17467.63s]  No, 10 community subs, not $10.
[17467.63s -> 17473.37s]  What am I talking about?
[17473.37s -> 17474.64s]  Thank you.
[17474.64s -> 17483.50s]  For all the community subs.
[17483.50s -> 17484.94s]  Thank you, GeniBeni for the five,
[17484.94s -> 17488.94s]  six, seven, eight, nine, 10, $11 here.
[17488.94s -> 17491.93s]  Hey, don't you think chat's annoying?
[17491.93s -> 17493.63s]  Like that pianist.
[17493.63s -> 17494.47s]  You're right.
[17494.47s -> 17504.48s]  Let's get some rock music in here.
[17504.48s -> 17507.88s]  How could you say something like that?
[17507.88s -> 17509.44s]  Jerma, it's illegal to download music
[17509.44s -> 17511.65s]  and movies off the internet.
[17511.65s -> 17514.46s]  I'm gonna go to internet jail.
[17514.46s -> 17517.76s]  It's not illegal to listen to music
[17517.76s -> 17526.80s]  on official Vivo YouTube account.
[17526.80s -> 17528.28s]  You wouldn't download a car.
[17531.49s -> 17532.81s]  Thank you, Siroc for the 250.
[17532.81s -> 17535.29s]  When you die, science will preserve your brain
[17535.29s -> 17537.05s]  and will harvest all your unused video
[17537.05s -> 17538.85s]  and stream ideas.
[17538.85s -> 17541.45s]  Also, Joel streamed 3D Movie Maker five days ago
[17541.45s -> 17549.22s]  and he got Sans to be in it.
[17549.22s -> 17551.12s]  It's a wonderful program.
[17551.12s -> 17558.23s]  I hope he had a lot of fun.
[17558.23s -> 17560.47s]  That program can be hell
[17560.47s -> 17565.28s]  to get to run stably at like 800 by 600.
[17565.28s -> 17569.84s]  Hopefully he got it to work pretty well.
[17569.84s -> 17576.19s]  But it's a blast if you can get it to work.
[17576.19s -> 17580.41s]  Sans confirmed for wrap movie three.
[17580.41s -> 17581.65s]  Something about the thanks in three bucks.
[17581.65s -> 17583.89s]  Hey Jerms, grandma found out I had her credit card.
[17583.89s -> 17584.73s]  I gotta get out of here.
[17584.73s -> 17585.81s]  I gotta go.
[17585.81s -> 17588.57s]  Don't use, don't do that.
[17588.57s -> 17590.92s]  I know you're fucking around.
[17590.92s -> 17594.94s]  But don't, don't, fuck, what are you thinking?
[17594.94s -> 17596.90s]  Are you fucking, are you serious?
[17596.90s -> 17601.68s]  Don't do that shit.
[17601.68s -> 17603.16s]  Sorry.
[17603.16s -> 17604.04s]  Say sorry.
[17604.04s -> 17612.35s]  Sorry.
[17612.35s -> 17614.07s]  Freudian weapon thanks for the five dollars, Freudian.
[17614.07s -> 17616.63s]  Random thought, but your old 500 subscriber video
[17616.63s -> 17618.79s]  really helps me power through my workouts.
[17618.79s -> 17621.81s]  It's the same kind of energy I try to have at the gym.
[17621.81s -> 17631.28s]  Yep, I used to love working out.
[17631.28s -> 17633.08s]  I miss those days sometimes,
[17633.08s -> 17639.50s]  but I'm kind of a mess if I'm honest.
[17639.50s -> 17641.92s]  I get like sore really easily now.
[17641.96s -> 17649.26s]  It just sucks, but it's all right.
[17649.26s -> 17655.04s]  Same energy.
[17655.04s -> 17659.34s]  I forget that it was almost eight years ago.
[17659.34s -> 17662.33s]  No, that was eight years ago.
[17662.33s -> 17669.10s]  I made my first YouTube videos just like fucking stacked.
[17669.10s -> 17677.72s]  Almost 10 years has gone by.
[17677.72s -> 17679.90s]  It's a long time.
[17679.90s -> 17681.70s]  Then I'm just happy to still be here.
[17681.70s -> 17685.89s]  I'm happy that eight years later there is,
[17685.89s -> 17687.01s]  I still, you know,
[17687.01s -> 17689.01s]  people still think this is interesting.
[17690.01s -> 17693.56s]  I still think this is interesting.
[17693.56s -> 17696.99s]  Holy shit, it took me forever to focus on anything.
[17696.99s -> 17701.07s]  Eight years?
[17701.07s -> 17712.54s]  I could barely keep my shoes tied for eight years.
[17712.54s -> 17715.08s]  Thank you.
[17715.08s -> 17716.92s]  I do miss those old workouts though.
[17716.92s -> 17719.15s]  They were a lot of fun.
[17719.15s -> 17720.71s]  Tingy thanks for the 250.
[17720.71s -> 17722.03s]  Hey Jermbo, I don't know if you're away,
[17722.03s -> 17724.35s]  but Twitch allows custom cheer modes.
[17725.70s -> 17727.34s]  I think we can see some custom cheer modes
[17727.34s -> 17729.02s]  related to the channel.
[17729.02s -> 17733.30s]  Maybe animated Jermachomp or OG Jerm doing the same.
[17733.54s -> 17734.38s]  Hope you consider this.
[17734.38s -> 17735.22s]  I'd love to see it.
[17735.22s -> 17737.49s]  I'm sure chat would too.
[17737.49s -> 17739.89s]  Yeah, actually, I gotta get in touch with Lordell
[17740.81s -> 17743.05s]  because there are a bunch of random things
[17743.05s -> 17745.21s]  that I'm gonna add to the channel.
[17745.21s -> 17748.72s]  We talked about it a little bit last week.
[17748.72s -> 17750.52s]  There will be animated cheer boats.
[17750.52s -> 17751.84s]  There will be new screens.
[17751.84s -> 17753.12s]  There will be some new music.
[17753.12s -> 17757.37s]  There will be some new animations.
[17757.37s -> 17758.21s]  It's been long enough.
[17758.21s -> 17760.92s]  I think it's time to do some more.
[17760.92s -> 17767.32s]  Maybe some more emotes too to fill up some slots.
[17767.32s -> 17769.72s]  I'll be getting in contact with him very soon.
[17781.91s -> 17789.72s]  There's another Vroom.
[17789.72s -> 17792.68s]  Another Vroom.
[17792.68s -> 17793.52s]  There they go.
[17797.92s -> 17803.84s]  There they go.
[17803.84s -> 17807.60s]  Vroom emote, that's not a bad idea.
[17807.60s -> 17808.48s]  I feel, I don't know though.
[17808.48s -> 17811.67s]  I feel like, do you think that would get tiring
[17811.67s -> 17814.89s]  after a while?
[17814.89s -> 17815.73s]  It might.
[17815.73s -> 17821.42s]  It might be a next situation where it just cars.
[17821.42s -> 17822.26s]  I don't know.
[17822.26s -> 17823.18s]  That's a tough one.
[17835.13s -> 17839.07s]  Thank you Paul in shirt for the $5.
[17839.07s -> 17841.61s]  Jerm, I made a gamer test for you.
[17841.61s -> 17844.23s]  Do it on stream.
[17844.23s -> 17848.21s]  This is a random link here.
[17848.21s -> 17850.29s]  This is something that I wanna make sure everyone's aware.
[17850.29s -> 17856.87s]  I don't click random links in bit donations.
[17857.03s -> 17860.59s]  If it's an mgirl link, if it's a YouTube link,
[17860.59s -> 17863.51s]  that's fine, but I don't just click random links
[17863.51s -> 17865.91s]  unless they're, you gotta be careful.
[17866.95s -> 17875.30s]  And Jerma lied about Minecraft VR is,
[17875.30s -> 17880.70s]  you're gonna have to change that username tomorrow.
[17880.70s -> 17887.94s]  But thank you for the five community subs.
[17887.94s -> 17889.14s]  Discord image links too.
[17889.14s -> 17892.78s]  Yeah, those are fine.
[17892.78s -> 17900.76s]  But if you have a link that's not one of those places,
[17900.78s -> 17901.82s]  you've got, we probably,
[17901.82s -> 17904.40s]  here's what's probably gonna have to happen.
[17904.40s -> 17908.06s]  I'm probably gonna have to get them screened
[17908.06s -> 17911.26s]  by a mod or something to make sure that it's,
[17911.26s -> 17912.18s]  you know, whatever it is
[17912.18s -> 17913.54s]  and then they can tell me about it later.
[17913.54s -> 17916.54s]  Well, as I'm in the end here,
[17916.54s -> 17919.42s]  because I really just can't click on random stuff.
[17922.23s -> 17924.99s]  Somebody, a person, no.
[17924.99s -> 17929.15s]  A person to taste the food before the king eats it.
[17929.15s -> 17934.71s]  But really though, oh, he dropped dead.
[17934.71s -> 17938.66s]  I'm not eating that meat pie.
[17938.66s -> 17940.34s]  What if a mod betrays you?
[17940.34s -> 17945.34s]  Long story short, if it's not Imgur YouTube Discord,
[17946.17s -> 17947.65s]  or like something that is,
[17947.65s -> 17949.61s]  I know exactly what it is from the link,
[17949.61s -> 17952.31s]  hyperlink itself, I'm not gonna click it.
[17954.79s -> 17955.63s]  I don't make that,
[17955.63s -> 17961.67s]  I'm probably gonna put that in the rules too.
[17961.67s -> 17962.51s]  I gotta be careful.
[17962.51s -> 17965.63s]  I gotta take care of myself, right?
[17965.63s -> 17970.86s]  But thank you for the $5.
[17970.86s -> 17972.86s]  And while some links might not look malicious,
[17972.86s -> 17976.26s]  I'm not saying this one is.
[17976.26s -> 17981.61s]  You never know, you just gotta be careful.
[17981.61s -> 17987.28s]  Notavirus.gov.
[17987.28s -> 17990.44s]  I do appreciate anything that anybody makes,
[17990.44s -> 17991.60s]  but we're probably gonna have to do a system
[17991.60s -> 17997.99s]  where links get sort of pre-screened.
[17997.99s -> 17999.27s]  Because I feel like I have missed things
[17999.27s -> 18001.31s]  people have sent me because I didn't wanna click it,
[18001.31s -> 18005.10s]  because I was like, I don't know what this is.
[18005.10s -> 18008.98s]  I'm gonna get a system in place.
[18008.98s -> 18010.88s]  But thank you for the $5, thank you.
[18013.11s -> 18014.57s]  Don't click, it's a gnome.
[18022.07s -> 18031.61s]  Don't click, it's a gnome.
[18031.61s -> 18035.17s]  But that was right, Dai gave 200 bucks right there too,
[18035.17s -> 18036.21s]  like 40 minutes ago.
[18047.94s -> 18049.74s]  Pasta's almost ready.
[18049.74s -> 18053.26s]  That's from Kim.
[18053.26s -> 18058.44s]  Oh shit, boys and girls, pasta.
[18058.44s -> 18059.70s]  All right, I gotta get out of here, I gotta go.
[18059.70s -> 18063.53s]  I gotta get out of here, I gotta get out.
[18063.53s -> 18064.77s]  It has been like eight hours, huh?
[18064.77s -> 18066.70s]  I haven't eaten, shit.
[18066.70s -> 18071.40s]  All right, well, thank you to Dai for the 200 bucks.
[18071.40s -> 18074.00s]  I'll be spending that on pasta, guaranteed.
[18074.00s -> 18075.56s]  Feroidian weapon, thanks for the 250.
[18075.56s -> 18077.60s]  Wow, it's not often I can stick around for live bits.
[18077.60s -> 18080.86s]  I usually just listen to the VOD with my morning coffee.
[18080.86s -> 18083.42s]  Have a good night, I'll see you tomorrow.
[18083.42s -> 18089.02s]  See you tomorrow, thanks for hanging out.
[18089.02s -> 18090.74s]  That's interesting that you watch the VODs
[18090.74s -> 18093.35s]  with coffee in the morning, that's cool.
[18093.35s -> 18098.32s]  It's an interesting way to do it.
[18098.32s -> 18100.66s]  Hey, Jewish bro, thanks for three bucks.
[18100.66s -> 18102.00s]  I ordered a dork cube and all I got
[18102.00s -> 18105.66s]  was a bunch of rusty razor blades and a lit cigarette
[18105.66s -> 18108.70s]  and is streaming your only job or does Kim work too?
[18108.74s -> 18113.80s]  Also, Ratmovie3 or Riot, Kim also works.
[18117.36s -> 18124.55s]  Kim has a job, tomorrow is my birthday?
[18124.55s -> 18126.43s]  No, your tomorrow is my today.
[18126.43s -> 18132.46s]  I don't know why I thought that you said that.
[18132.46s -> 18137.62s]  But on top of streaming, I also do construction.
[18137.62s -> 18142.38s]  So a lot of the bridges and buildings
[18142.38s -> 18149.38s]  and department buildings and stuff, I design them.
[18149.38s -> 18157.66s]  I design them and then I build them by myself
[18157.66s -> 18167.87s]  in less than two weeks.
[18167.87s -> 18172.89s]  Yo, this guy's a professional liar.
[18172.89s -> 18175.54s]  I should play a fucking game
[18175.54s -> 18177.86s]  where I just don't say anything true the whole stream
[18177.86s -> 18178.82s]  and then people have to figure out
[18178.82s -> 18182.93s]  what is a lie and what's not.
[18182.93s -> 18185.25s]  Let's do that, that sounds like fun.
[18185.25s -> 18188.75s]  Have a way to chat to get involved
[18188.75s -> 18192.77s]  and I'll just say a bunch of dog shit all stream.
[18192.77s -> 18194.85s]  It's just a reverse lie detector.
[18194.85s -> 18200.22s]  That's every stream.
[18200.22s -> 18202.86s]  All Mew, thanks for the 10 bucks, all Mew.
[18202.86s -> 18204.50s]  Oh God, oh God, Jerma, I'm sorry,
[18204.50s -> 18206.50s]  but I can't pay the protection this month.
[18206.50s -> 18208.58s]  Oh shit, please.
[18208.58s -> 18212.22s]  This is all I have, I can't afford to lose.
[18212.22s -> 18214.58s]  You almost got me to say that.
[18214.58s -> 18217.66s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks though, all Mew.
[18217.66s -> 18218.50s]  Thank you.
[18218.50s -> 18223.50s]  Hey, Bobo, Bobo Bobo, thank you Bobo Bobo for the 10 bucks.
[18223.60s -> 18225.58s]  No message, 10 dollars from Bobo Bobo.
[18229.75s -> 18233.52s]  Thank you, Wreckersd, Wreckersd for the 10 bucks.
[18233.52s -> 18235.32s]  Jerma, I tried to send this three times,
[18235.32s -> 18237.40s]  but it was very silly.
[18237.40s -> 18240.64s]  Chat helped me make sure I got it sent this right
[18240.64s -> 18243.92s]  this time, so shout out to the wonderful boys here.
[18243.92s -> 18246.68s]  Love you and enjoy the holidays, Dad.
[18246.68s -> 18251.96s]  Thank you so much for the 10 bucks, Wreckers.
[18251.96s -> 18253.68s]  Incredibly generous amount of money to give me.
[18253.68s -> 18255.64s]  Thank you, glad you figured it out.
[18255.64s -> 18259.30s]  Thank you.
[18259.30s -> 18261.38s]  And thank you, the Cremator for the eight bucks.
[18261.38s -> 18264.02s]  Jerma, it's from a flame thrower
[18264.02s -> 18267.00s]  with the spray and lighter.
[18267.00s -> 18273.45s]  Oh, well don't fucking do that.
[18273.49s -> 18275.85s]  You gotta be fucking careful, don't do that shit.
[18290.36s -> 18297.09s]  Don't play with that kind of stuff.
[18297.09s -> 18299.75s]  Go open up Gary's mod.
[18299.75s -> 18301.55s]  What are you thinking?
[18301.55s -> 18309.86s]  Be careful.
[18309.86s -> 18321.70s]  That's very, very much something you should not be doing.
[18321.70s -> 18324.87s]  But thank you for the eight bucks.
[18324.87s -> 18331.98s]  Take care of yourself, be fucking careful.
[18331.98s -> 18333.86s]  Hey, Bobo Bobo, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[18333.86s -> 18334.98s]  Hey Jerma, I've been a fan of your content
[18334.98s -> 18336.82s]  since the grandpa face reveal.
[18336.82s -> 18338.02s]  That's a long time ago.
[18338.94s -> 18340.90s]  Can't tell you how many times you've made my day
[18340.90s -> 18342.58s]  by watching one of your videos.
[18342.58s -> 18344.14s]  You've helped me through so much over the years.
[18344.14s -> 18346.38s]  I want to give you a personal thank you
[18346.38s -> 18348.39s]  for all that you've done.
[18348.39s -> 18354.83s]  Well, Bobo Bob, I actually think it might be Bobo Bob 99.
[18356.56s -> 18358.20s]  That's $20 here from me.
[18358.20s -> 18360.36s]  That's more than I could ever, ever expect somebody
[18360.36s -> 18363.50s]  to pay me for any reason.
[18363.50s -> 18365.14s]  And that grandpa face reveal,
[18365.14s -> 18368.40s]  I do remember making that.
[18368.40s -> 18370.29s]  That was a fun one to make.
[18370.29s -> 18371.53s]  Thank you so much for sticking around
[18371.53s -> 18373.93s]  for like fucking seven years.
[18373.93s -> 18394.00s]  That's a long ass time, thank you.
[18394.00s -> 18395.36s]  Grandpa is dead.
[18395.36s -> 18400.28s]  No, grandpa is in hell.
[18400.28s -> 18402.60s]  So, you know, whatever.
[18406.48s -> 18414.28s]  Okay, so what does that mean exactly?
[18414.28s -> 18417.39s]  Right, you know the lore.
[18417.39s -> 18419.60s]  I don't need to explain it.
[18419.60s -> 18420.52s]  Jess, you got it.
[18420.52s -> 18421.36s]  Thanks for the 250.
[18421.36s -> 18424.28s]  Making a full song on stream would be really cool.
[18424.28s -> 18425.68s]  You could use your beatboxing ability.
[18425.68s -> 18430.16s]  Joel did one before with beef songs called Pigeon Techno.
[18430.16s -> 18437.88s]  I still wanna do, I still wanna do that Fruity Loops stream.
[18438.36s -> 18443.07s]  I wanna get people to actually play instruments though.
[18443.07s -> 18443.91s]  It's too many.
[18443.91s -> 18444.75s]  I gotta focus on one of these ideas.
[18444.75s -> 18450.11s]  I had just too many of them.
[18450.11s -> 18453.51s]  There is something in particular that is gonna,
[18453.51s -> 18456.52s]  it's summertime, it has to be nice around.
[18456.52s -> 18458.24s]  The one of the main things that I've been wanting
[18458.24s -> 18460.32s]  to do for a long time cannot be done
[18460.32s -> 18463.04s]  until it is a higher temperature.
[18463.04s -> 18466.04s]  It's getting there real soon.
[18466.04s -> 18468.48s]  You're just gonna see it one day.
[18468.48s -> 18469.52s]  I'm not gonna talk about it.
[18469.52s -> 18475.27s]  It's just gonna happen.
[18475.27s -> 18477.39s]  Garfield of Monday killer, thank you for the 250.
[18477.39s -> 18478.95s]  Jerma, it's Garf.
[18478.95s -> 18480.99s]  I just got out of Captain Marvel.
[18480.99s -> 18482.67s]  What a movie that was.
[18482.67s -> 18484.75s]  It had a funny orange cat in it.
[18484.75s -> 18486.27s]  Fun fact, Goose the Cat was played
[18486.27s -> 18487.83s]  by four different cats.
[18487.83s -> 18489.39s]  Two of which are named after muppets,
[18489.39s -> 18491.03s]  Gonzo and Rizzo.
[18491.03s -> 18492.39s]  Ain't that sweet.
[18492.39s -> 18495.27s]  Like to see some cat representation in mainstream media
[18495.27s -> 18497.63s]  other than Secret Life of Pets and yours truly.
[18500.23s -> 18503.75s]  Okay, thank Captain Marvel, more like Cat Tan Marvel.
[18503.75s -> 18506.03s]  Thank you, thank you, Chad is just loving that one.
[18506.03s -> 18508.79s]  Chat, more like Cat Zing.
[18508.79s -> 18517.99s]  That's thanks, I will be here all week.
[18517.99s -> 18519.84s]  Is Shazam any good?
[18519.84s -> 18521.48s]  Is that out yet?
[18521.48s -> 18524.04s]  That's the other Captain Marvel.
[18524.04s -> 18525.08s]  I'm gonna go see Captain Marvel.
[18525.08s -> 18528.84s]  I'm gonna go see the other Captain Marvel Shazam.
[18528.84s -> 18532.52s]  I'm gonna see them both and we'll see what is out.
[18532.52s -> 18533.84s]  No, it's not, you just did the smiley face
[18533.84s -> 18535.04s]  like the I'm lying face.
[18539.45s -> 18545.23s]  Early April, it looks pretty good.
[18545.23s -> 18551.85s]  Yeah, it looks wholesome, let's put it that way.
[18552.01s -> 18555.76s]  Thank you, Garfield.
[18555.76s -> 18558.16s]  Thank you to Matt's friend for $30.
[18558.16s -> 18559.72s]  Hey, Jerma, it's my birthday this Sunday.
[18559.72s -> 18560.76s]  Can you sing me happy birthday?
[18560.76s -> 18564.44s]  How about I just say happy birthday?
[18564.44s -> 18570.49s]  March 17th, have a good birthday.
[18570.49s -> 18575.00s]  Have a fantastic birthday bash.
[18575.00s -> 18579.52s]  Thank you for the 30 bucks, it's a lot of money.
[18579.52s -> 18583.35s]  Heel's birthday, man.
[18583.35s -> 18589.28s]  Cake and ice cream isn't on its way.
[18589.28s -> 18591.12s]  Thank you, Alf the librarian for $3,
[18591.12s -> 18593.84s]  but Jerma, my books are 20% off.
[18593.84s -> 18597.48s]  You could have a friend 90% off.
[18597.48s -> 18599.40s]  Buy one of my fantastic books.
[18599.40s -> 18601.32s]  My library has retro and new books,
[18601.32s -> 18607.61s]  even fan-made books, rat's books.
[18607.61s -> 18613.88s]  Where do you live that you have all these books?
[18613.88s -> 18617.12s]  Do you live in a, oh, your name's the librarian, right?
[18617.12s -> 18618.32s]  I get it.
[18618.32s -> 18625.80s]  It's another character.
[18625.80s -> 18628.24s]  Why do we have like five different
[18628.24s -> 18632.95s]  role-playing characters here?
[18632.95s -> 18636.27s]  Now I'm starting to get it.
[18636.27s -> 18638.79s]  Every stream there's like a new character.
[18638.79s -> 18657.87s]  It's part of the universe, oh God.
[18657.87s -> 18662.65s]  But thank you.
[18662.65s -> 18664.89s]  Thank you to Hike Zero for the 250.
[18664.89s -> 18667.09s]  Here is my rat movie three song.
[18667.09s -> 18669.69s]  I can't wait to watch the full length feature film.
[18669.69s -> 18673.74s]  Jump and chomp.
[18673.74s -> 18684.58s]  Did you, wait, did you already put this together?
[18684.58s -> 18686.10s]  Did somebody already do this?
[18686.10s -> 18696.33s]  You already did this.
[18696.33s -> 18709.49s]  Let me get it in here.
[18709.49s -> 18716.43s]  Why can I, I can't get this to play.
[18716.43s -> 18726.53s]  What the hell?
[18726.53s -> 18736.28s]  Uh, hold on.
[18736.28s -> 18738.72s]  It worked for me, hold on, let me see if I can.
[18741.52s -> 18742.36s]  Oh, no, that's why.
[18742.36s -> 18743.20s]  Okay, I got it.
[18746.10s -> 18753.19s]  All right, here we go, let's hear it.
[18753.23s -> 18756.47s]  We're the rats, we're the yet, we're the yet, we're the yet.
[18756.47s -> 18758.51s]  We're the rats, we're the rats, yes, we're the rats.
[18758.51s -> 18760.51s]  We're the yet, we're the yet, we're the rat.
[18760.51s -> 18762.55s]  We're the rats, we're the rats, yes, we're the rats.
[18762.55s -> 18767.54s]  We're the yet, we're the yet, we're the yet, we're the yet.
[18767.54s -> 18778.75s]  Ha ha, what?
[18778.75s -> 18782.85s]  We're the rats, we're the rats, yes, we're the rats.
[18782.85s -> 18784.89s]  We're the rats, we're the yet, we're the rat.
[18784.89s -> 18787.45s]  We're the rats, yes, we're the rats, we're the yet,
[18787.45s -> 18789.98s]  we're the yet, we're the yet, we're the rat.
[18789.98s -> 18794.00s]  Yes, we're the rats, we're the yet, we're the rat.
[18794.00s -> 18798.39s]  Yes, we're the rats, we're the yet, we're the rat.
[18798.39s -> 18807.12s]  We're the rats, we're the yet, we're the yet, we're the yet.
[18807.12s -> 18813.35s]  Something like that, something like that.
[18813.35s -> 18819.76s]  Thank you for that, that was fucking awesome.
[18819.76s -> 18822.74s]  That was what was in mind.
[18822.74s -> 18825.92s]  They may have been some lyrics in the middle
[18825.92s -> 18830.38s]  to add some flavor.
[18830.38s -> 18832.06s]  But thank you, Hike Zero, that was fucking,
[18832.06s -> 18837.26s]  that was great, thank you so much.
[18837.26s -> 18839.26s]  Thank you, Nickname Jack for the three bucks.
[18839.26s -> 18840.78s]  Decide to join a random TF2 game
[18840.78s -> 18842.62s]  while you're talking to virtual fish.
[18842.62s -> 18845.18s]  Someone recognizes my name as a reference
[18845.18s -> 18847.30s]  and just asks, did you see the fish
[18847.30s -> 18849.18s]  called Jerma a virgin?
[18849.18s -> 18854.59s]  And you know what I did, absolute gold.
[18854.59s -> 18857.32s]  Link, link, link, link, link.
[18857.32s -> 18861.96s]  Here is the link to the rat song
[18861.96s -> 18863.32s]  that was carefully crafted.
[18866.82s -> 18868.10s]  That's fucking hilarious.
[18868.10s -> 18873.48s]  Thank you, Nickname Jack.
[18873.48s -> 18876.46s]  And then finally, let's run the credits
[18876.46s -> 18879.32s]  while we do, is it one or two more here?
[18879.32s -> 18882.02s]  Credits, there they are.
[18882.02s -> 18883.86s]  Here come all the subs, all the resubs,
[18883.86s -> 18889.61s]  all the new subs.
[18889.61s -> 18891.69s]  You guys continue to keep the wheels spinning
[18891.69s -> 18896.70s]  on this stream and then some.
[18896.70s -> 18902.74s]  Thank you, everybody.
[18903.58s -> 18906.12s]  Oh yeah, the librarian came back in for five dollars.
[18906.12s -> 18910.95s]  We can give you your books, our books for free.
[18910.95s -> 18913.07s]  I don't need free, I don't need a free book.
[18913.07s -> 18914.67s]  I wanna come in there and I wanna rent it
[18914.67s -> 18916.57s]  like a blockbuster.
[18916.57s -> 18917.81s]  I wanna go in there and I wanna bring that book
[18917.81s -> 18920.85s]  back in three days or I have to forget about it.
[18920.85s -> 18922.25s]  And then my parents get a bill in the mail
[18922.25s -> 18931.16s]  for $268 four and a half months later.
[18931.16s -> 18938.71s]  That's what I want.
[18938.71s -> 18940.83s]  Thank you, Cremator for the five dollars.
[18940.83s -> 18945.14s]  Video game flamethrower isn't as fun,
[18945.14s -> 18947.50s]  but it's safe and it's not gonna hurt you.
[18953.03s -> 18954.59s]  Then wait for the library to go out of business
[18954.59s -> 18958.06s]  and never pay the fee.
[18958.06s -> 18960.58s]  I don't remember, did you, did,
[18960.58s -> 18964.55s]  they used to probably go to collections, right?
[18964.55s -> 18966.71s]  If you, did they do that back then?
[18966.71s -> 18972.79s]  I don't remember.
[18972.79s -> 18976.41s]  If you didn't pay for months and months
[18976.41s -> 18978.60s]  and months or a year,
[18978.60s -> 18984.44s]  did Blockbuster ever send your bill to collections?
[18984.44s -> 18988.58s]  I don't know.
[18988.58s -> 18992.75s]  If you don't turn up for a year, they would erase it.
[18992.75s -> 18998.30s]  Wow, that's kind of ridiculous.
[18998.46s -> 19001.88s]  I mean, I guess how would they be able to keep track of that?
[19001.88s -> 19002.72s]  They would have to be sending
[19002.72s -> 19005.02s]  so many people to collections.
[19005.02s -> 19010.25s]  That's why they went out of business.
[19010.25s -> 19012.85s]  Oh, hey, Geni, Benny, thanks for the five bucks.
[19012.85s -> 19014.77s]  Stream is over, that sucks.
[19014.77s -> 19017.64s]  Am I gonna read the TF2 comics?
[19017.64s -> 19020.89s]  I read them all when they originally came out.
[19020.89s -> 19022.17s]  This hasn't been a new TF2 comic
[19022.17s -> 19024.41s]  in like a couple of years, right?
[19024.41s -> 19039.45s]  At least a year.
[19039.45s -> 19041.93s]  Will you be covering Pokemon Spear and Bow
[19041.93s -> 19044.00s]  when it comes out?
[19044.00s -> 19048.20s]  Probably not.
[19048.20s -> 19049.64s]  I don't really play Pokemon.
[19057.75s -> 19059.15s]  Finally, Cremator, last bits.
[19059.15s -> 19060.15s]  I'll take your word for it.
[19060.15s -> 19063.00s]  You should try it and feel your eyes melt.
[19063.00s -> 19066.92s]  It's, no, no, I'm not gonna do that.
[19066.92s -> 19069.11s]  I'm not gonna do that.
[19069.11s -> 19076.70s]  They say, but don't worry, my hand's been through worse.
[19076.70s -> 19078.56s]  Take care of yourself.
[19078.56s -> 19083.53s]  It's not worth it.
[19083.53s -> 19084.45s]  Well, you won't be covering them
[19084.45s -> 19086.73s]  because they're not real.
[19086.73s -> 19091.71s]  Oh, it's not real.
[19096.60s -> 19106.57s]  I can't stop hearing the new rat song.
[19106.57s -> 19109.29s]  All right, guys, I'm beat.
[19109.33s -> 19114.07s]  I will see you tomorrow for VR.
[19114.07s -> 19114.91s]  Get some sleep.
[19114.91s -> 19118.98s]  Thanks for sticking around, everybody.
[19118.98s -> 19123.18s]  I'm gonna go eat some pasta.
[19123.18s -> 19124.54s]  Photos, thanks for 250.
[19124.54s -> 19125.54s]  Ah, messing this up.
[19125.54s -> 19128.65s]  Sorry, have a good night.
[19128.65s -> 19130.64s]  Looks like you got it.
[19130.64s -> 19132.08s]  Thank you so much, Photos.
[19132.08s -> 19136.14s]  Photo S, Photas for the 250.
[19136.14s -> 19138.18s]  I will see you tomorrow for Minecraft VR
[19140.15s -> 19142.96s]  and some other stuff.
[19142.96s -> 19144.16s]  Have a great night, guys.
