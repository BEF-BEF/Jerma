[15.74s -> 24.92s]  Hey, April Fools. I'm not late today. There's the joke. There's the prank. I'm pranking you right now.
[24.92s -> 45.93s]  You're being pranked. Got ya. Oh man, you see your face. Oh, I got ya. How's my stomach? It's doing
[45.93s -> 61.40s]  alright. It's doing better. Good enough to stream. Yeah, today we're going to be playing Breath of
[61.40s -> 67.86s]  the Wild. I know a lot of people thought this wasn't going to happen. I've been saying I was
[67.86s -> 71.78s]  going to play Breath of the Wild over and over and over again for the last three or four months.
[73.26s -> 88.22s]  And now I'm finally doing it. How am I supposed to work if you keep streaming? I don't know. Go
[88.22s -> 97.78s]  do what you need to do and then earn your own after. It's been two months. I think it's been
[97.78s -> 109.24s]  longer than that. When was the last time I played Breath of the Wild? How long? It's been three or
[109.24s -> 117.88s]  four months. Oh, the mods are having a little bit of fun here. Good luck writing the word the
[118.68s -> 124.89s]  because I think that gets you timed out. Good luck. Mods are going to get rid of all like the
[124.89s -> 139.40s]  fucking like like the all the only speaking vowels or what are consonants allowed? Is that
[139.40s -> 151.85s]  the right word? What's that word? That's other letters. Consonant. Yeah, apparently the channel
[151.85s -> 156.41s]  was an emote only for the last like 16 to 17 hours, which is I guess kind of funny.
[157.99s -> 164.55s]  We all got into the chat today and I was we were talking to mod chat and it's like, wait a minute.
[164.55s -> 171.70s]  Oh, it's just been on emote only all night and all day. Oh, well, I already left it on last night.
[174.54s -> 187.05s]  Oops, 16 hours, bro. The words are the blocked words are now the is and how I'll put stupid on
[187.05s -> 196.34s]  there to put stupid, put going too slow, put the brain, put a ton of words that you know,
[196.34s -> 201.69s]  because nobody can say anything about my gameplay today. Take the word. I want gameplay.
[202.65s -> 211.56s]  I want gamer. I want gaming on that list. Only leave the nice words. Leave smart, talented,
[212.52s -> 223.61s]  funny, handsome. You know what I mean? That's all. That's all I want. Now we're just going to play.
[223.61s -> 228.46s]  Cam's not going to go on today and I assure you it's not a scenario where the cam is off
[228.46s -> 232.70s]  and slowly my room is going to get comedically sucked into a black hole and I'm going to turn
[232.70s -> 237.66s]  it on and be getting sucked into a black hole out a window or something that's not going to happen.
[237.66s -> 241.58s]  I know it's like April Fool's and a lot of people like expect something that's not happening today.
[241.58s -> 256.73s]  I'm just going to play Breath of the Wild. So there you are. I love OK, here are the terms
[256.73s -> 261.45s]  and phrases that are blocked right now and it reads like a funny story. Let me let me read you
[261.45s -> 267.93s]  the block list in in the order that I feel like reading it in. How is the gamer going too slow?
[268.65s -> 280.50s]  Brain sucks. Those are all individual blocked words. How is the gamer going too slow? Brain sucks.
[280.50s -> 285.37s]  Those are all words you cannot say today and I just happen to read them in an order that is
[286.09s -> 292.94s]  in order that I want to make sure it can't be written. Mods, just keep anytime you see
[292.94s -> 300.04s]  somebody talking shit, just add that to the block list until it's only just like happy positive
[300.04s -> 317.03s]  energy. Positive vibes only. Smelly? Nah, that doesn't offend me. Keep that on. That's fine.
[319.08s -> 335.00s]  Just keep it going. Well, don't just say words. Come on. Bald? Yep. All I'm telling you is your
[335.00s -> 339.40s]  chat experience today is probably going to be a little fucked up. So just be aware of that.
[339.40s -> 343.96s]  I know somebody's going to write the word the get timed out and they're going to be pissed,
[343.96s -> 348.20s]  but just I just know it's a fun. It's a funny day today. Okay, it's a funny day.
[349.88s -> 355.46s]  Just don't worry. What about asymmetrical? Like asymmetrical face?
[358.54s -> 364.30s]  Old. Well, that's just that's a factual statement. So I mean, I'm not old. No, remove that.
[365.99s -> 374.02s]  Remove tiny. Yeah, they'll they'll get a good list going. Anyways, haven't seen this in a while.
[374.02s -> 387.64s]  Have you? I don't be really honest with everybody here. I have no idea how to play. I have no
[387.64s -> 392.62s]  idea how to play this game anymore. It's been like three months. What am I? What do I do?
[392.62s -> 417.67s]  I think I have this marked. Where was I even going? This is marked. Where's the next guardian?
[417.67s -> 427.83s]  Just reset. I'm not going to reset. Is it here? I think I wouldn't have marked that if it wasn't
[427.83s -> 439.86s]  where I was going. We're going there. I've got to play. Okay, I'm good. It's B to open the glider.
[439.86s -> 449.51s]  How do I grab a rock? How do I grab the side of the how do I grab? Okay, it's X. Why can't I hear
[449.51s -> 465.38s]  this very well? There we go. You're a noob. Put that on the list too. Wait, no, I remember I got
[465.38s -> 473.21s]  attacked by like lightning and shit. I don't think I can go this way. I remember. Don't forget to
[473.21s -> 482.10s]  tweet. Oh shit, you're right. Thanks. I didn't. No, I didn't. This tweet sucks. Whatever. Oh,
[482.10s -> 489.13s]  did I lose my verified status? Do you want me to read you the draft tweet? That's never getting
[489.13s -> 499.02s]  posted, but it's a draft tweet. I haven't I had a draft tweet for when I lost verified status.
[499.02s -> 503.42s]  It didn't happen yet, so I can't post it because it didn't happen yet. So I'm just going to read
[503.42s -> 517.05s]  it to you now and then not post it. Okay, so this tweet is what does it say here? Okay,
[517.05s -> 523.05s]  drafts. Okay, this is what I was going to post when I lost verified status. It's not even that
[523.05s -> 529.93s]  funny, but I'm going to read it. Twitter removed my verified badge. How do I stop it? Is there a
[529.93s -> 535.26s]  questionnaire I can take? Can anyone lend a hand? Restarting my router didn't seem to do anything.
[535.26s -> 548.14s]  All my speed tests are perfect. I don't understand. That's pretty. That's all right. This is all right.
[548.14s -> 558.87s]  I think the funny part for me for that tweet is all my speed tests are perfect. Minus two is now
[558.87s -> 580.68s]  blocked. Oh, all right. Okay. All right. Look at that. Am I going to die from this? Probably.
[580.68s -> 596.52s]  Mods. Mods. They're finding a way to get around it. Fix it. I don't know how to play. I don't know
[596.52s -> 601.14s]  how to play the game. What did I just do? What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. How to restart
[601.14s -> 610.07s]  the game. That was the moonlight scimitar. What was that? Was that a valuable weapon? I don't
[610.07s -> 629.13s]  remember how to play. Is that bad? Should I actually go back? I'm going back. I have no
[629.13s -> 639.61s]  idea what that was. I don't. It's a legendary weapon. Look at this thing. Twenty five damage.
[639.61s -> 645.43s]  Are you kidding me? I don't want to do that. All right. Let's keep going. That's where I was
[645.43s -> 652.10s]  going anyways. We're good. All right. Let me figure. Okay. X. No, this is Y. Y is attack.
[652.74s -> 663.13s]  B is jump. A is confirm. X is run. Left trigger is whatever this is. Is this block?
[663.13s -> 682.66s]  Okay, that's block. Left bumper is camera. This one's way better. Okay. Right bumper is
[682.66s -> 697.18s]  throw weapon. Don't do that. Right trigger is arrow. Up is powers. Left is shields. Right is
[697.18s -> 707.54s]  swords. What? Down is horse. But I haven't I haven't used the horse in like 40 hours of
[707.54s -> 713.80s]  gameplay. All right, let's go. I'm ready. This is a good skit. This is so stupid. You spelled it with
[713.80s -> 726.92s]  S T U V money sign T U P 1 D. It's like you guys are trying to get around the name filter in video
[726.92s -> 735.80s]  games. How do I spell fuck face without getting around the filter? Oh, I'll do like, uh, E E F
[735.80s -> 753.30s]  F like F H, uh, U, um, Ampersand new voice on log.
[760.02s -> 766.34s]  It doesn't spell fuck face. E E F H U Ampersand. What is that?
[772.62s -> 777.18s]  Remove stupid from the fucking board pull immediately. I can see it over here.
[777.18s -> 790.90s]  Well, you never heard the word Ampersand before. All right. I already realized I'm chilling out
[790.90s -> 813.16s]  today. Hey, you know what? Yeah. How's that? What's Perry? How do I make it so it doesn't do this
[813.16s -> 823.99s]  weird globe? What just happened? This thing's about to break. What is happening to my character?
[824.63s -> 841.53s]  What is going on? Why is this guy like harder than a boss? I'm getting hurt too. I'm cold.
[841.53s -> 850.94s]  I don't think it's supposed to go this way. I'm not I am not supposed to do what I'm supposed
[850.94s -> 858.36s]  to be doing right now. I'm not I'm not supposed to be going this way. This is not the way you're
[858.44s -> 863.40s]  supposed to go. I haven't played the game in three months. I don't know what route I was on.
[864.12s -> 883.67s]  I'm going this way. Do you know what they should make in video games? And I know people can be
[883.67s -> 889.51s]  like, oh, here he goes again. But listen to me. If the game knows you haven't played in three months,
[889.51s -> 894.63s]  I wish I could watch like a fucking recap video. Like a one minute recap like
[898.65s -> 902.98s]  that's in the background. We see you haven't played breath of the wild in six months.
[903.06s -> 906.58s]  Let us give you a quick crash course on everything that's happened and everything you need to know.
[917.37s -> 925.13s]  I'm doing this. You did your bit this bit already with Metal Gear Solid. There's a whole second
[925.13s -> 941.32s]  YouTube channel that you did this already. You read the sign, bro. For real, you just skipped
[941.32s -> 958.97s]  the entire oasis. So did I? Why are you so mean? All right, we will have a little fun today because
[958.97s -> 969.66s]  I would like for you to bet if I can beat this in 10 minutes. And I don't know if I would bet on me
[969.66s -> 980.42s]  right now, because I don't even know what the buttons do. I don't want you to see after three
[980.42s -> 1000.38s]  months. There's no way. Well, then you know what to do. I would rather go broke a believer
[1000.38s -> 1013.42s]  than be rich and doubter. Wow. That's like really nice. That's like actually really sweet of you.
[1025.51s -> 1036.42s]  We believe in you. I hate you. Yeah, I know that all things must be balanced. All right. Are we
[1036.42s -> 1043.21s]  ready? In three, I'm looking at we make sure one of the mods has a clock. It's 10 minutes.
[1043.21s -> 1052.49s]  Three, two, one, go. I fuck. I think I give up. I don't know if I can do this.
[1054.26s -> 1078.34s]  This looks really complicated. I don't just put it down. Whoa. What? Oh, how do I safely? OK.
[1080.50s -> 1115.34s]  I need more barrels. What the fuck? Are there any more barrels? What is this? That goes over here,
[1115.34s -> 1120.22s]  which then this connects to here. I need way more shit. How am I supposed to get up here?
[1120.78s -> 1167.10s]  There's only one barrel in this whole area. How am I supposed to do? I forgot I had this power.
[1167.10s -> 1192.06s]  OK, I need another barrel. What if I do this? Can I? Everybody wants to help so bad. OK,
[1192.06s -> 1197.51s]  so what does this do? This counts as electricity. Can I get this electricity? Oh, this counts as
[1197.51s -> 1205.13s]  electricity. This counts as electricity. Shit. Another barrel. That's not a shit scenario.
[1205.13s -> 1218.42s]  That's a nice. Honestly, R1. I'm so used to. OK, I got another barrel. This is going right here.
[1218.42s -> 1263.29s]  How much do we have time? Am I good on time? Shit. I got to replace this right here. All right. OK.
[1266.94s -> 1290.58s]  What happened? What? What is going on? What the fuck? I walked over the. Now I'm just like,
[1292.79s -> 1301.21s]  all right, well, come on. The timer is still going. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.
[1301.21s -> 1306.58s]  I'm working on it. I'm working on it. Why would you ever vote for me right now? Like ever? Like,
[1306.58s -> 1312.04s]  what were you thinking? What were you thinking today? You really thought this is going to work
[1312.04s -> 1328.30s]  out? I'm surprised. What were you thinking? What are you doing? You're doing the pointing
[1328.30s -> 1358.63s]  and laughing emote. Who cares? Stop touching electricity, you fucking moron. OK. All right.
[1358.63s -> 1368.41s]  We're good. I got plenty of time. I got six minutes. Six minutes is a lot of time. Thunder
[1368.41s -> 1384.07s]  blade. Oh, God damn it. Nice. Oh, this thing's Ricky. Ricky. Cool. This thing is
[1385.03s -> 1389.83s]  Ricky. Cool. What? I was going to say Rick, like from Rick and Morty.
[1397.98s -> 1405.82s]  It's wicked. Cool. How do I open that? I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[1417.27s -> 1420.55s]  Oh, dude, I forgot to tell you guys, I turned on the new Space Jam movie
[1422.46s -> 1426.78s]  and I couldn't follow anything that was going on. I hadn't. I actually had no idea what was
[1426.78s -> 1439.74s]  happening in the movie. The first 50 minutes of that movie were just, it reminded me of like
[1439.74s -> 1446.22s]  Kingdom Hearts in a way. But Kingdom Hearts just kind of did it way better. It was like, oh, hey,
[1446.22s -> 1450.62s]  look, we're going to, hey, I just want to let you know that we, there's a character that is cool.
[1450.62s -> 1455.54s]  We're going to go to their world for 15 minutes and then we're going to leave. And by the way,
[1455.54s -> 1460.23s]  it's just the fucking Looney Tunes. None of the other characters do anything. Let's go to the
[1460.23s -> 1465.69s]  Batman world for like five fucking five minutes and that's it. Batman's not going to be in the
[1465.69s -> 1470.23s]  fucking movie, by the way. It's only, it's just the Looney Tunes. We're just going to go visit
[1470.23s -> 1474.73s]  every world, Kingdom Hearts style for like five minutes. That's the first, oh, I got to play.
[1474.73s -> 1506.34s]  All right. Where is it? Right there. Oh shit. Hold on. It's in here. Dude, don't do this to me
[1506.34s -> 1514.50s]  right now. There's money on the line right now. Okay. This is connected to here. That's already
[1514.50s -> 1521.82s]  going up there, which I think that just, hold on. Wait, hold on. That's going to give me that.
[1527.90s -> 1537.14s]  And then, wait, oh fuck. How do I, that has to go there. Is there another barrel I don't have?
[1537.14s -> 1547.53s]  There must be another barrel or something. How do I open this? Unless I have to get in here first.
[1547.53s -> 1556.63s]  Hold on. Is there another barrel? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[1569.88s -> 1576.06s]  No, there's another, where's there another barrel? Do I need another barrel? I'm so close,
[1576.06s -> 1632.34s]  but where's the, what do I got time? Get over here. Come on. Come on. I'm so close. Stop. What
[1632.34s -> 1640.65s]  do I got? 20 seconds, Twi. I got 20 seconds. 20 seconds. Oh, everybody eat shit. I just did it.
[1645.50s -> 1661.21s]  And time with like five, 10 seconds to spare. You had like three seconds left. It was frame perfect.
[1672.15s -> 1680.95s]  I mean, I'm, wait, is it, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second.
[1680.95s -> 1687.46s]  Do we need to review it? We need to review the VOD. Apparently it was like one frame
[1687.46s -> 1696.04s]  is potential away from, it's one frame. It was, it may have been off by a frame. No. What? No,
[1696.04s -> 1706.68s]  it's not. Hold on. Let me get the VOD. Really? No way. So it's 10 minutes exactly. Right? Hold on.
[1706.68s -> 1719.35s]  I'll get it. Everybody hold for a second. Hold on. I gotta go. Is the VOD might not have it yet.
[1719.35s -> 1732.63s]  Sometimes it takes a few minutes. Okay. Recent broadcast. All right. Okay. Hold on. Let me get
[1732.63s -> 1752.78s]  this on stream. This is weird. I'm like putting the VOD in here. Okay. Okay. All right. I got
[1752.78s -> 1760.89s]  the VOD here. The question is now, so where was it? It was, it's where I say three, two, one, go.
[1760.89s -> 1777.67s]  All right. I got to plug my headphones into another, cause they're plugged into the, it's over.
[1777.67s -> 1788.26s]  It was 1001. It was 10, zero, zero, zero, one. What? Hold on. I, this is crazy. I need to plug
[1788.26s -> 1813.85s]  this in one sec. All right. What's the time here? Why am I not talking? Is there audio on this stream?
[1816.46s -> 1825.32s]  Where's the audio? There's no audio. I don't, why am I not talking? I don't know if I can do this.
[1826.36s -> 1840.47s]  The only thing I said. What the fuck? Okay. Um, looking at, we may, looking at, we may, two, one,
[1841.11s -> 1857.50s]  go. Okay. It's 1726. Forgot I had this power vote for me. Oh God. And by the way, it's Batman's
[1857.50s -> 1869.46s]  world kingdom heart style for like five. The VOD isn't even caught up yet. The VOD isn't even caught
[1869.46s -> 1887.03s]  up yet guys. We need to wait. Uh, we have to wait just a minute. Refresh it. Hold on. All right.
[1887.03s -> 1908.18s]  Refreshed. Okay. Let's go back to where it was there. Okay. So we got it. So what was it? 26,
[1908.18s -> 1928.98s]  right? So it's 1726. Two, one, go. Yep. It's 1726. Fuck. How do I? Oh, everybody. I just did it.
[1928.98s -> 1941.18s]  Three, 24, 25, 26. Wait, no, I don't know. I think that counts. I just did it. I guys, that counts.
[1942.57s -> 1975.53s]  1726. How do I do playback speed? I jumped. I jumped guys. I've my buttons. Do you understand
[1976.39s -> 1981.43s]  that? I'm telling you right now. I think I count that because one very important thing
[1982.79s -> 1989.51s]  I hit jump instead of accept because remember it all video games are swapped, right? It's like,
[1989.51s -> 1995.83s]  oh, B is A on Xbox and A is B and X is Y and that's, I don't know. Do we count that?
[2014.02s -> 2023.34s]  It really is like one frame. I don't know. It's, it's like, it's like a frame or two late.
[2023.34s -> 2027.90s]  Fuck you. You've stopped playing and talked about space jam for two minutes.
[2027.90s -> 2040.98s]  Um, does it count? I don't know. I've never had to deliberate this long on something like this.
[2040.98s -> 2047.22s]  What, what about walking through the door? Honestly, I think walking, I think walking
[2047.22s -> 2052.81s]  through the door is the solution. That's what I would say. Like I've walked through the book.
[2052.81s -> 2064.86s]  It's over. I win, right? It wasn't in 10 minutes. I don't have frames for this though.
[2065.42s -> 2088.14s]  Oh, shut up. You're annoying. Okay. I'm going to do space. I think I'm saying it. Do you hear that?
[2088.14s -> 2101.82s]  It's like, like I say time right when it's in 26 still. You know what? I don't know. I don't
[2101.82s -> 2112.81s]  know what to do. I think it, but what if it's wrong? What the fuck? If I just shut up about
[2112.81s -> 2130.07s]  space jam. I didn't do it. I did. I don't think I did it. I don't think I did it.
[2131.03s -> 2137.21s]  Because you know what, in mod chat, we're talking about this. People, uh, in mod chat, it's being
[2137.21s -> 2146.44s]  brought to my attention that in previous times it was when I accepted the reward. It looks like I
[2146.44s -> 2155.45s]  accepted the reward a 10th of a second too late because I jumped and it was one full second later
[2155.45s -> 2164.30s]  I accept the reward. I'm sorry everybody, but we, we have, we got, I'm sorry everybody. That's the
[2164.30s -> 2171.18s]  way it works. You shouldn't be mad at the frame perfect loss. You should be mad at me talking
[2171.18s -> 2179.96s]  about space jam for five minutes. Yeah, that we gotta, we gotta, that we gotta go by the truth
[2179.96s -> 2196.47s]  and that was the truth. I know. I'm so sorry. That's the truth. We gotta go by the truth.
[2196.47s -> 2216.02s]  All right. Okay, let's go. Bugs of Bunny can fuck off. Bugs of Bunny can fuck off. What? What's
[2216.02s -> 2225.85s]  going on? What? What's going on? What? What's still open? My stream is not open.
[2227.37s -> 2233.29s]  My stream is not open. My stream is not open. I'm telling you right now. My stream is not open.
[2233.93s -> 2240.09s]  Oh, okay. The banner is playing the stream. If you just go to German 985, the banner plays it.
[2240.09s -> 2250.98s]  No, it doesn't. What the fuck is going on? Yeah. The banner is playing the stream. All right. Let's
[2250.98s -> 2266.95s]  get back to it. Sorry, everybody. Okay. Sorry. Oh, sorry. I gotta plug this back in.
[2269.02s -> 2283.54s]  Taze on day. That's a classic. All right. That was cool. I got the floor. What's up? Oh, I was just
[2283.54s -> 2292.81s]  so focused just now. Do you have business with me? I don't know. What are you doing? But no,
[2292.81s -> 2297.61s]  I'm not a spy. I'm a merchant. I may not look like it, but I'm actually the leader of a caravan.
[2297.61s -> 2301.51s]  I've traveled all the way here, but this town doesn't allow men to go in. So that's why I had
[2301.51s -> 2308.28s]  to, um, be spying. It's research. It's research. And think what you want. But I finally found some
[2308.28s -> 2315.98s]  key info on how to sneak into Gerudo town. Oh, in key info. Let me share with you my heroic tale.
[2316.54s -> 2320.44s]  It's been close to a week now. The guards have kicked me out more times than I can count.
[2320.44s -> 2325.40s]  I almost gave up hope. However, I have learned only recently of a man that slipped into this
[2325.40s -> 2331.50s]  well guarded town or that men is frequently traveling between Kara Kara Bazaar and Gerudo
[2331.50s -> 2344.73s]  town and waiting here trying to spot him as he traveled. This is bright. I'm surprised he can
[2344.73s -> 2368.44s]  read. They're from the town. It said in between the town. Okay. So this is the road. Good travel on
[2368.44s -> 2396.70s]  the road. No fun allowed. There is no fun allowed. Not today. Why do I not have a horse? I have not
[2396.70s -> 2409.88s]  had a horse the entire playthrough. I have to walk this whole way. This got to be a state.
[2409.88s -> 2424.39s]  Frank 2 is right here. You're not too far away. What? Oh, it's too hot for the horse. Oh, shit.
[2424.39s -> 2439.72s]  Okay. By the way, why am I not on the road? There is no road. Use your shield. All right. How do I
[2439.72s -> 2452.71s]  do that? It's like a weird button combination, right? Remember what's wrong, babe? You've barely
[2452.71s -> 2476.12s]  touched your gruel. No, I'm not. I'm not feeling it today. L plus A. There it is. Okay. Holy shit.
[2476.12s -> 2503.70s]  That was cool. Okay. I don't see anybody. Do you? My boss, I get the feeling that he isn't coming
[2503.70s -> 2511.66s]  back from Gerudo town anytime soon. Hope he's okay. Man snuck in. What? There's a man who got
[2511.66s -> 2517.34s]  into Gerudo town? And the boss says he comes here to the Kara Kara Bazaar? I guess it must be true
[2517.34s -> 2523.26s]  if the boss said so. Never seen anyone around who respects me as a super sneaky guy. There was that
[2523.26s -> 2528.62s]  pretty Hylian gal at the general store. It's unusual to see a Hylian girl dress like a Gerudo.
[2528.62s -> 2533.19s]  Her Gerudo clothes. I wonder where she bought them. Maybe if I wore those clothes. Ah, nah. I'm
[2533.19s -> 2543.53s]  so out of my element with all this sneaky stuff. Okay. What's our use for a weapon? What's the
[2543.53s -> 2556.25s]  shittiest thing that I have? Probably this. This thing sucks, right? Oh, that thing kind of sucks,
[2556.25s -> 2572.79s]  doesn't it? What's the matter? You got this look on your face that almost screams I gotta talk to
[2572.79s -> 2598.09s]  you right now. Buy my stuff. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Buy my book. Somebody knows
[2598.09s -> 2609.54s]  what that is. Okay. I have a lot of junk, but I don't want to sell anything right now. Okay.
[2610.49s -> 2626.76s]  Uh, hi. Who are you? Uh, you, you're a voe, aren't you? Gotta go. I am. Why? Hmm. No, I bet mama
[2626.76s -> 2635.14s]  would have a problem with a delicate voe like you. Oh yes, I'm Ronson. I hail from Gerudo town.
[2635.14s -> 2639.90s]  The search for the love of my life is so exhausted by it. I'm exhausted by it.
[2639.90s -> 2645.83s]  Search. Uh, I don't know why I'm even saying this. It's no business of a Hylian like you, but
[2645.91s -> 2649.19s]  I'm constantly being bothered by my mother over not having found the love of my life.
[2651.14s -> 2656.09s]  Why the rush? You don't know? Really? It's incredibly rare for a male to be born
[2656.09s -> 2661.03s]  to the Gerudo. For our own survival as a people, we travel to find husbands. I've
[2661.03s -> 2666.23s]  proven myself to be a gifted tailor, but none of the voe I've met seem to appreciate a well hemmed
[2666.23s -> 2671.30s]  garment. I was hoping my craft would help me find a mate, but it doesn't seem like there's much work
[2671.30s -> 2677.35s]  for a tailor around here. I wonder if there's really, if there really is someone out there for
[2677.67s -> 2705.48s]  me. What's this person doing? A treasure hidden inside a sandstorm by an ancient civilization.
[2705.48s -> 2710.33s]  Sounds like an adventure just waiting to happen. They say the sandstorm lets up for a few hours
[2710.33s -> 2716.98s]  each day, but I haven't seen it settle down for even an instant. Shifty merchants. Sorry,
[2716.98s -> 2729.77s]  no idea what you're talking about. The only things- did you fart? No. The only things I'm
[2729.77s -> 2733.93s]  interested in right now are this sandstorm and the treasure hiding inside its storming sands.
[2733.93s -> 2745.67s]  Okay, well, who are you? Okay, so there's a treasure over there? Okay. Who do I need to talk to?
[2750.74s -> 2757.35s]  Any suspicious vendors. From my point of view, pretty much any merchant that is in Gerudo looks
[2757.35s -> 2769.72s]  suspicious, you realize. Still, no, it's my chair squeaking. The general store. Okay, where's the
[2769.72s -> 2786.65s]  general store? I thought that was a lion. Isn't this the general store right here? Oh, maybe this
[2786.65s -> 2802.41s]  is the general store. What do you got? That divine beast, it feels like it gets a little bit closer
[2802.41s -> 2807.86s]  every day. I wonder how long it'll be before I can get back to Gerudo town. Gerudo town.
[2807.86s -> 2812.87s]  There's a town to the southwest made up almost entirely of Gerudo. It's the largest settlement
[2812.87s -> 2818.44s]  in these parts. It's got a lively market and a canteen. The town's active from morning to night.
[2818.44s -> 2824.12s]  But well, they have a rule that'll affect you guys aren't allowed in. No vo may enter, they say.
[2825.77s -> 2839.35s]  Okay, I know. I'll take care of it. I got the divine beast, I got it. The sound of the divine
[2839.35s -> 2852.62s]  beast walking might be loud, but the beds are still comfy. Do you want to stay? No. What does this
[2852.62s -> 2862.92s]  even go to? I can't just take that? All right, so there's somebody in here I need to talk to?
[2863.74s -> 2873.58s]  Is it you? Oh, have you seen a sneaky guy? Sneaky what? You mean a vo sneaking around town. I
[2873.58s -> 2882.23s]  haven't seen anyone like that. There's a Hylian Vi who likes to relax on the roof, though in the
[2882.23s -> 2908.65s]  afternoon it's probably too hot up there. Do I have to sleep or something? Climb, climb,
[2909.13s -> 2927.51s]  stop doing that. Somebody's sleeping up here. Please don't turn face cam on. No, I'm not going
[2927.51s -> 2937.11s]  to. All right, hi. Oh my, what a lovely young lad you are. Do you need something from me?
[2938.18s -> 2942.42s]  Um, yes. What's that? You've heard about a man who snuck into Gerudo town. Oh, I don't
[2942.42s -> 2949.22s]  know anything. I don't know anything about him. Sorry, I couldn't be more help. Um, either one of
[2949.22s -> 2956.95s]  these? Gwent? You're making my cheeks warm looking at me like that. Um, which one of these do I do?
[2956.95s -> 2963.51s]  This one? I'm sure you agree that these clothes only help my looks, right? Now that I think about
[2963.51s -> 2967.91s]  it, the style would look quite fetching on you. I'd have to charge you of course, but I bet people
[2967.91s -> 2971.19s]  would see you completely differently if you wore them. What do you think? Do you want to buy them
[2971.19s -> 2995.00s]  for 600 rupees? Fuck out of here. Are you kidding me? Oh my fucking shins. All right, I need to sell
[2995.00s -> 3013.62s]  something. What do I have that's worth anything? All right, scream. Scream if I'm going to delete
[3013.62s -> 3019.10s]  something that's valuable because I forget this. There's certain things I can get rid of, like the
[3019.10s -> 3027.56s]  amber pieces or something, right? Are these valuable? What's the thing I can sell? It's been
[3027.56s -> 3041.54s]  three months. Sell the parts. I have a lot of these, you're right. It's not worth that much,
[3041.54s -> 3053.06s]  though. Sell the gems. Sell the gems. Sell the gems. Um, like this? Is this okay? How many do I need?
[3053.06s -> 3072.12s]  I have 225. Is that okay? That's okay, right? Just don't sell the luminous ore. Okay, this is more
[3072.12s -> 3095.34s]  than that. I hope I'm not doing something wrong. All right, let's go. Haha, softlocked April fools.
[3095.34s -> 3109.70s]  I keep holding X to go faster, but that's not how you do it. You have to jump. It's okay,
[3109.70s -> 3119.34s]  you'll find more. Yeah, I'll be all right. Gems don't have any purpose but just to sell. Okay.
[3120.06s -> 3141.05s]  All right, let's do it. All right, I already did this, right? Six. Is this a- I'm not going
[3141.05s -> 3171.85s]  to get scammed or something, am I? That's a lot of money. E. You look adorable. Ah, hee hee hee.
[3171.85s -> 3176.81s]  Just as I thought, you bake for quite a good looking gal. That's a traditional Gerudo outfit.
[3176.81s -> 3180.33s]  It's such a striking look around here. I doubt anyone would even suspect that you're a man.
[3180.33s -> 3183.85s]  On top of that, it breathes so well that it's sure to help you deal with the desert heat,
[3183.85s -> 3189.64s]  at least a little. So glad I was able to help you out. If you're free to grab something to
[3189.64s -> 3206.30s]  eat sometime, keep me in mind. What was that? What was that? Oh, if you want to get more ladies
[3206.30s -> 3214.49s]  clothing, come back any time. Okay, all right, let's go. Does this have any- does this have,
[3214.49s -> 3226.41s]  like, armor? Protects from the harsh sun. Wait, does this give me heat resistant?
[3226.41s -> 3232.90s]  Ooh, all right, cool. Let's go. Now I can just get in. I can just walk in, right?
[3243.66s -> 3250.01s]  Don't jump in the lava. I can teleport? Oh, that's right. I forgot. I forgot that was a
[3250.01s -> 3271.53s]  feature of this video game. Drip acquired. Bro forgot about fast travel. When you're going to
[3271.53s -> 3279.54s]  do a blink cosplay. Why can't you just cheat millions of rupees in? Because that's cheating.
[3280.18s -> 3299.59s]  All right, so can I just go in? What's going on over there? All right, I'm going in.
[3300.31s -> 3314.34s]  I can just walk in? Hi. Okay. Vore strictly forbidden. Take your time. Okay. If you stop
[3314.34s -> 3318.02s]  by the canteen, do yourself a favor and order a noble pursuit. It's hands down the best ring
[3318.02s -> 3339.77s]  I've ever had. This is a bright ass place. This area is 95% bloom. Okay. I already have all this,
[3339.77s -> 3361.03s]  don't I? It's your brightness? I don't think it's my brightness. I don't have any money to buy
[3361.03s -> 3378.71s]  anything. Take- you can take the outfit off now? No, I can't. Yes, you can. I said I couldn't- I
[3378.71s -> 3389.80s]  have to- hold on. There's the Gerudo chief. Yet another traveler. What did you get in here?
[3393.42s -> 3405.62s]  Seems you have something rather interesting there. I didn't know they spoke in this game.
[3406.42s -> 3415.58s]  Some of them do. Declare your business but come no closer. Hold on, Ulyara. This one appears to be
[3415.58s -> 3423.86s]  more than a common traveler. You there, what is your name? Link. And what is it you've come all
[3423.86s -> 3434.94s]  the way here to tell me? I only got one option. I can calm Naboris. You think you have what it takes
[3434.94s -> 3439.98s]  to subdue something so powerful as a divine beast. The only ones who could ever control them
[3439.98s -> 3446.23s]  were champions like Lady Urbosa. And all of the champions died in the Calamity a hundred years
[3446.23s -> 3454.39s]  ago. Hmm. Ulyara, a memory just jumped into my head. Something my mother spoke of. When the
[3454.39s -> 3459.91s]  Calamity happened, the princes of Hyrule placed a fallen swordsman into a deep sleep. That swordsman,
[3459.91s -> 3463.99s]  much like our new friend here, was named Link. That would always seem more legend than fact.
[3464.70s -> 3469.82s]  But Lady Riju, do those same stories not also say that a Hylian champion carried a legendary
[3469.82s -> 3475.48s]  sword? I see no such weapon in this person's care. They do indeed, if I recall correctly.
[3475.48s -> 3481.03s]  It was called the sword that seals the darkness. A princess of Hyrule supposedly hid it away
[3481.59s -> 3493.24s]  at every target in America. And every Walmart in America. What if the device on this one's hip?
[3493.24s -> 3500.58s]  It appears to be a precious relic of the Sheikah. I can't imagine they would give something so
[3500.58s -> 3506.46s]  valuable to a simple drifter, can you? I don't remember ever hearing of a Hylian Vi among the
[3506.46s -> 3513.91s]  champions. Wait a minute. You're a Vo. A Vo within our walls is a great crime, but a Vo who is a
[3513.91s -> 3519.35s]  champion? Well, we'd never mistreat a friend of Lady Urbosa. If you're here to help us with
[3519.35s -> 3527.40s]  Naboris, then we are allies. You saw it on your way to our town. Divine Beast Va Naboris cloaked in
[3527.40s -> 3532.90s]  a massive sandstorm hurling lightning at any who dare approach. We have to do something to stop it,
[3532.90s -> 3536.78s]  but we have yet to find any way to appease the Divine Beast on our own.
[3536.78s -> 3543.42s]  If you truly are a champion, perhaps you will be able to enter Naboris and calm its anger.
[3543.42s -> 3559.10s]  Lady Riju. Am I saying that right? Is it Riju? Riju? Am I saying it wrong? Is it Riju? Riju.
[3559.10s -> 3568.36s]  Riju. Okay. Perhaps if this person were first to prove his worth by recovering your stolen
[3568.36s -> 3574.71s]  thunder helm. Ah yes, an interesting suggestion. You see, there is only one thing in all the
[3574.71s -> 3581.26s]  Hyrule that can withstand the lightning from Naboris. Thunder Helm, a family heirloom and
[3581.26s -> 3587.18s]  relic of Gerudo. But as Buliaras says, it was stolen from us. You didn't worry Lady Riju,
[3587.18s -> 3591.85s]  if he truly is a champion, this should be an easy task for him. As long as he's not streaming on
[3591.85s -> 3597.37s]  Twitch. He's not a streamer. It'll take less than probably 30 minutes, but if he is a streamer,
[3597.37s -> 3602.82s]  then we're fucked for at least like six hours. You can't even minus two. Don't worry. I got it
[3602.82s -> 3607.50s]  covered. Our soldiers can tell you all you need to know about the thieves that stole Lady Riju's
[3607.50s -> 3613.91s]  heirloom. Head through this arch. It will lead you to the barracks. Then seek out Captain Teek
[3613.91s -> 3621.00s]  and ask for full report. Without my heirloom, you'll never be able to approach Naboris. Okay.
[3621.00s -> 3647.62s]  So I have to get that. Okay. Where are the gems? Hello. What are you doing in here? This is the
[3647.62s -> 3652.65s]  barracks for the chief's guards. Not a place for tourists to gather. We're on high alert after the
[3652.65s -> 3663.05s]  recent theft. So you should clear out. Turn down the brightness. I don't... Did I fuck it up?
[3663.05s -> 3669.08s]  Hold on a second. My apologies. I'm the officer in charge of the soldiers, Captain Teek. The
[3669.08s -> 3674.12s]  chief's heirloom was stolen by thieves belonging to the Yiga clan the other day. So everyone is on
[3674.12s -> 3681.02s]  edge. We've determined that the Yiga's hideout is in Carusa Valley. The soldiers are all exhausted.
[3681.02s -> 3690.10s]  So I was just thinking about requesting some extra help. Listen up. This Hylian Vi has agreed to help
[3690.10s -> 3696.01s]  us. So offer her any information you can. Consider her a part of our unit. If you have any questions,
[3696.01s -> 3714.26s]  my troops would be happy to help. Is it bright? I don't think I can even do that. Turn up the
[3714.26s -> 3725.83s]  brightness. Wait hold on. There's not like gamma on this or something that I have turned up. No
[3725.83s -> 3738.62s]  there's not. I think that's just how it is guys. Gotcha April Fools. Getting real fucking sick of
[3738.62s -> 3769.62s]  putting this up. Okay let's go. I don't have any money but okay. So this is the Divine Beast. So I
[3769.62s -> 3791.59s]  need to get... Where's the helm? They said what? Some town or valley or something? Over here. Okay.
[3791.59s -> 3821.58s]  So I gotta go over here. Check your quests. Ah okay. I think I just have to go up there.
[3821.58s -> 3837.91s]  Let's go that way. Oh you're a Hylian Vi. We don't see too many of you. I can't tell how old you are
[3837.91s -> 3841.94s]  but you look a little young to be coming to my shop. We make special drinks here. Drinks that
[3841.94s -> 3852.70s]  are definitely just for adults. How old is Link? Our featured cocktail is called Noble Pursuit. Many
[3852.70s -> 3858.60s]  of our customers come here specifically to order it. A light sweet taste. The cool sensation from
[3858.60s -> 3881.69s]  Meatship. It's like drinking distilled motivation. Okay so I can't I can't drink it. Link is 17.
[3881.69s -> 3925.94s]  Okay he's 117. What? He slept for 100 years. Oh huh? He was very tired. It was at the start of the
[3925.94s -> 3934.97s]  game. That was four months ago. I don't remember that. I feel like I've been asleep for 100 years.
[3938.41s -> 3942.31s]  Okay so I think I'm just gonna go up here but I don't have like a place to go.
[3944.31s -> 3961.13s]  Was it actually in the quest log? I don't see it anywhere. Oh I have to talk to everybody okay.
[3961.13s -> 3975.24s]  The yellow circle on the map. Yeah that's really far up. What are you doing in here?
[3975.88s -> 3980.68s]  I'm an archaeologist of sorts. I was just poring over some ancient text that I discovered the other
[3980.68s -> 3986.68s]  day and I finally decoded it. Well part of it at least but the rest it's not far off.
[3986.68s -> 3990.62s]  With this discovery I'll finally be able to make a name for myself as an archaeologist.
[3991.26s -> 3998.09s]  Of course you and I meeting here is no coincidence. I've never been one to question fate.
[3998.09s -> 4002.41s]  I can't explain why but I trust you for some reason. I'll tell you the details of my research.
[4002.41s -> 4006.68s]  Let's hear it. There's a temple east of here near the entrance to the
[4007.32s -> 4013.99s]  Gerudo desert. It's dedicated to the seven giant statues of the heroines said to be the divine
[4013.99s -> 4019.67s]  protectors of Gerudo. It's at this temple that I originally discovered the ancient script or reads
[4019.67s -> 4023.94s]  when the symbols of the seven find their place the blessed path will be revealed. That's all I've
[4023.94s -> 4029.46s]  been able to get. You know I'm going way too fast. It's believed that people once came from around
[4029.46s -> 4035.58s]  the world in search of the heroine's blessing but as far as I can tell it doesn't appear that anyone
[4035.58s -> 4043.37s]  has found it yet. I'm not sure what exactly it means but maybe I'll find out once I've deciphered
[4043.37s -> 4050.39s]  more of the text. I'm not sure if this is related but it said that heroines held powers that were
[4050.39s -> 4057.10s]  part of a bigger whole. Each heroine had a different power, skill, spirit, endurance, knowledge,
[4057.10s -> 4066.98s]  flight, motion, and gentleness. Interesting. But they all look the same to me. I should understand
[4066.98s -> 4074.01s]  the entire script before long but that's only the beginning of my problems. That divine beast has
[4074.01s -> 4078.28s]  been moving around the area making it harder for me to conduct my research. There's no respect for
[4078.28s -> 4090.10s]  academia. What would my because what there's the seven deadly sins and then this is seven deadly
[4090.10s -> 4097.16s]  virtues whatever it is right. There's an opposite. What are the virtues? A lot of people don't know
[4097.16s -> 4102.68s]  that there are seven virtues and there are seven sins. Everyone's like oh you know envy, lust,
[4102.68s -> 4110.25s]  pride, greed. Nobody ever talks about the virtues. The seven heavenly virtues. It's charity,
[4111.51s -> 4125.29s]  um charity, humility, what are they? Humility, charity, humility, charity, chastity, gratitude,
[4125.29s -> 4144.71s]  temperance, patience, and diligence. Those are the seven virtues versus the seven sins. Yeah all we
[4144.71s -> 4150.23s]  ever hear about is like oh greed and envy. I want to hear more about fucking temperance. What's
[4150.23s -> 4178.36s]  temperance's deal? Okay so let's talk. Go play Binding of Isaac then. Okay you are you serious?
[4178.36s -> 4183.78s]  Why did you let her go by herself? I apologize she said she just wanted to check it out.
[4186.33s -> 4190.09s]  Oh as if we aren't busy enough searching for the chief's heirloom. Now we have to find
[4190.09s -> 4195.21s]  Barta too. If the captain hears about this fiasco she'll punish us for sure. Probably a hundred laps
[4195.21s -> 4208.04s]  around Jevudo desert again. Catholic Andy. I did I'm just saying we have everyone always does a
[4208.04s -> 4212.28s]  bunch of shit about the seven deadly sins but we never hear about fucking chastity. We never hear
[4212.28s -> 4227.51s]  about um harmony or whatever the other one is. We never hear about charity well charity yeah.
[4227.51s -> 4231.51s]  It's chastity. What is hold on a second why is everybody freaking out about this?
[4238.60s -> 4245.56s]  The state or practice of refraining from extramarital or especially from all sexual intercourse.
[4250.15s -> 4278.25s]  Chastity is no sex. The virtues most virtuous of all streamers.
[4279.21s -> 4286.62s]  Yeah what am I talking about? I'm sitting here going like you know we keep hearing about greed
[4286.62s -> 4291.58s]  and lust. I want to hear more about no sexual intercourse. I want to hear about no sex, no
[4291.58s -> 4298.22s]  alcohol, no drugs. I also want to hear about um being polite to I want to be where's politeness.
[4298.78s -> 4314.70s]  What are the other ones? Hold on I need to break this down. The seven virtues.
[4318.20s -> 4325.70s]  Humility okay humility. I think everybody could do with a little bit of humility right. What's
[4325.70s -> 4331.29s]  wrong with that? Charity. What's wrong with that? Gratitude. I think people you know being
[4331.85s -> 4341.40s]  gratitude being thankful and patience. That's a really big one. Patience is a huge one.
[4341.40s -> 4346.86s]  Diligence. That's a big one. Temperance. Let me look this up before this temperance doesn't
[4346.86s -> 4356.18s]  mean like sex or anything right? Temperance is the moderation in action thought or feeling
[4356.18s -> 4365.94s]  restraint. Moderation in the indulgence or passions. I would be temperance. We got fucking
[4365.94s -> 4379.98s]  oh we we got we got the most virtuous of all the virtues. Temperance. All things in moderation.
[4399.08s -> 4410.65s]  Temperance Andy. The only thing I knew about temperance was it spawned the blood donation
[4410.65s -> 4425.29s]  machine in Isaac. That's it. That's the only thing I knew. All right these guys are fucking
[4425.29s -> 4444.20s]  horrible. These guys are got a lot of health. This thing breaks. Okay oh yeah it's jump over
[4444.20s -> 4450.60s]  or jump to the side right. I'm gonna jump over it and do the big flurry. It didn't count.
[4451.24s -> 4473.43s]  Oh dude don't even. What the fuck? What do you even have any food? Kind of stealth boost.
[4477.11s -> 4493.62s]  Oh I'll eat this. Oh my god I hate this enemy. They just do a gigantic aoe that you can't get
[4493.62s -> 4509.69s]  away from. Everyone's so much faster than me. I'm just running. You won. I'm I lost. I'm
[4510.33s -> 4516.74s]  are you kidding me? What is going on with these enemies? Why are they like tuned up times a
[4516.74s -> 4536.54s]  hundred fucking million? What? I'm not even going that way. You have no armor on? Oh shit I had
[4536.54s -> 4558.09s]  armor on last time and still do the same thing. I'm reading mod chat. I did know what that is.
[4558.81s -> 4578.97s]  I've heard that before. I just I thought it meant something else too. What the fuck does you think
[4578.97s -> 4603.85s]  it meant? I I don't know. There's no way I'm gonna climb that. What's going on over here?
[4603.93s -> 4622.34s]  No temperance? Yeah I'm showing a lot of temperance right now by not fucking banning
[4622.34s -> 4639.02s]  like 4 000 of you from the chat. Can I launch this? That's patience not temperance. Oh well
[4639.02s -> 4658.78s]  temperance is restraint. Restraint, moderation. It's gonna go the correct way. This dude is a
[4658.78s -> 4679.83s]  heretic. You have to balance the virtues with the sins. There was one time that Holly and I
[4681.48s -> 4687.13s]  were eating and watching tv and we were watching a video of somebody eating a bunch of food. It was
[4687.13s -> 4692.74s]  one of those like oh look eat videos. I forget which one it was what we were even fucking watching
[4692.74s -> 4702.63s]  but we were eating a pie together. Yeah a mukbang. Yeah we were eating a pie and it was a banana
[4702.63s -> 4706.73s]  cream pie. We were just eating out of the tin together and I remember I was pointing at the
[4706.73s -> 4714.31s]  screen going this is this is sin. This is sin right here and we're eating a fucking pie out
[4714.31s -> 4723.42s]  of the tin together. It was like what what am I talking about? I was going this is sin. This is
[4723.42s -> 4729.82s]  sin right here and I had a mouthful of whipped cream and banana cream and I was shoveling it
[4729.82s -> 4734.95s]  into my mouth on the fucking couch and she started laughing her ass off. I'm just like what what?
[4734.95s -> 4743.50s]  She's like do you this is sin looking into a mirror. No you don't understand this is sin.
[4745.37s -> 4751.53s]  This is delicious banana cream pie by the way honey. Oh yeah I'll take a lot of spoonful full
[4752.17s -> 4775.59s]  of it. It was just such it was such a hypocrite. Why did that scare the shit out of me?
[4775.59s -> 4784.30s]  Is he a ghost? What's wrong with Link? He's just like oh he's a ghost. Can I make it up here?
[4803.66s -> 4809.42s]  No I didn't start saying okay no no no no no I think people have uh or let me let me give some
[4809.42s -> 4818.66s]  more context. I didn't start by chanting that. We had watched like five of them in a row sitting
[4818.66s -> 4824.66s]  there eating this pie and at at some point during this pie eating watching mukbangs is when I just
[4824.66s -> 4830.92s]  started pointing at the screen saying it. I don't know we were just watching. I think people just
[4830.92s -> 4836.49s]  don't people underestimate how much media I consume all the time. I watch a lot of shit. I
[4836.49s -> 4848.82s]  watch tons of streamers and YouTube channels and TV shows. I just don't really talk about it. No yes
[4854.34s -> 4875.29s]  where am I going? I could have just teleported over here. I thought you didn't watch much movie
[4875.29s -> 4883.93s]  or TVs. Years ago that was the case. I want to say the last the last like six to twelve months
[4883.93s -> 4893.05s]  we've been watching a lot of media. I'm just hanging out on the couch. I am catching up with
[4893.05s -> 4901.35s]  almost a decade of TV I've not watched. So think about how awesome the position I'm in is. Think
[4901.35s -> 4906.07s]  of all the TV shows that have been huge. All the all the animes that you keep telling me to watch
[4906.07s -> 4912.23s]  that I've not seen a single episode of that is a queued up. I got Better Call Saul. I got I media
[4912.87s -> 4920.41s]  this this I forgot I forgot to play the game. God damn it I hate when this happens. Oh my god
[4920.41s -> 4939.37s]  what is going on right now? I think I'm screwed here. Let's teleport again. Good call. There's
[4939.37s -> 4945.08s]  so much TV. There's so much movie. All the movies too. Oh you know what we saw um recently as well
[4945.08s -> 4961.26s]  we saw the new Puss in Boots. That was really cool. That was that was a really just nice movie.
[4961.26s -> 4968.76s]  It was a really nice movie. Okay I'm gonna go this way because that's I think this is the correct way
[4968.76s -> 4980.42s]  to go to get up there. It was very good. So um I I don't want to speak completely out of my ass
[4980.42s -> 4986.71s]  because I don't know who was you know animation director on that movie but I really like this new
[4986.71s -> 4991.83s]  trend of animated movies especially with the action sequences dropping their frame rates down
[4991.83s -> 5001.48s]  a little. It's almost like that low frame rate feeling where oh this again Into the Spider-Verse
[5001.48s -> 5016.02s]  did that where each frame was almost deliberate. I really love that style a lot. It's kind of like
[5016.02s -> 5024.60s]  comic-y yeah. I don't like the high frame rate shit. I you know anti-technology Andy that's fine.
[5025.48s -> 5033.56s]  A 60 fps like a full like movie shot in like 48 fps and on those like plasma screen TVs
[5033.56s -> 5042.60s]  where it's like 500 hertz it's just it's just it's a movie now. It's a movie now. It's not I can't
[5042.60s -> 5049.93s]  suspend my disbelief that much anymore. I remember watching I think it was one of the Lord of the
[5049.93s -> 5057.72s]  Rings in 48. I think maybe it was The Hobbit or something and it was at 48 144 hertz 240 hertz or
[5057.72s -> 5063.06s]  something. It was just I felt like somebody was videotaping it with a camcorder. They were actors
[5063.06s -> 5078.01s]  on the screen. It wasn't a movie anymore. Now you want to go? It's the self-opera effect. Exactly.
[5078.01s -> 5108.26s]  Exactly. Stop. Oh my goodness. What did I just spawn? Look at all those gems. All right goodbye.
[5108.74s -> 5122.89s]  Frame rate really only matters for games. I miss like 16 millimeter too. I know I'm an old person
[5123.61s -> 5128.04s]  but though a lot of movies that are filmed in 16 and 30 millimeter film
[5128.86s -> 5135.99s]  they act they feel different. They hit way differently. A lot of people here.
[5135.99s -> 5160.46s]  Why even fight them? All right don't kill me please. These drop a lot of money. Holy shit.
[5162.79s -> 5175.00s]  Okay what's this? Duplex bow. Fire two arrows at once.
[5177.67s -> 5188.41s]  How do I change my bow? Oh it has to be out first. Okay this thing's almost broken so I'm
[5188.41s -> 5219.83s]  just gonna get rid of it. And now what? Torch? Is this some puzzle bullshit? This is some puzzle
[5219.83s -> 5239.91s]  bullshit isn't it? I can't even carry anything. I have to get rid of this because it's gonna want
[5239.91s -> 5246.54s]  me to walk around with the torch. I'm gonna light the torch here. Yep okay. What the hell do you
[5246.54s -> 5259.29s]  want me to do? Be more positive? Oh sure actually. So even if I don't know where I'm going I think
[5259.29s -> 5267.58s]  it's fine. I should be fine. It takes a little longer but that's okay. This door has fire on it.
[5267.58s -> 5276.79s]  I'm imagining it has something to do with my flame in my hand. Oh I can go this way.
[5277.86s -> 5290.90s]  That's where I came from. It's okay to check though. Maybe I burn the door? Really good. That
[5290.90s -> 5299.46s]  was a good idea. I just had a really good idea. I'm not gonna hurt them. Nothing over here.
[5300.10s -> 5316.34s]  It's okay. It was worth a try. Fuck away from me. You little monsters. Let me try doing this.
[5317.22s -> 5332.71s]  Oh I can move these. Maybe I should burn them. Customer service. Oh that's another okay um you
[5332.71s -> 5337.75s]  know also I've seen a little bit of uh we've watched some of the old Jackie Chan movies.
[5339.19s -> 5348.84s]  If have any of you ever seen Drunken Master? Holy shit those movies are fucking unbelievable.
[5352.49s -> 5361.13s]  The old police story movies? Wow. If you've never seen police story, if you've never seen Drunken
[5361.13s -> 5371.53s]  Master 1 and 2 please please for the love of god within the next two or three days go watch them.
[5371.53s -> 5378.01s]  The amount of of skill and the amount of of dedication that that they did in those movies
[5378.01s -> 5385.21s]  they were fucking unbelievable. It's required reading for the stream now. Gremlins 2 is on
[5385.21s -> 5397.26s]  there. Drunken Master 2 is on there too. Are you okay? Yeah I'm good. Are you? Which ones? Police
[5397.26s -> 5406.25s]  story and then Drunken Master. Jackie Chan it's gone. The old catalog of the old 80s and 90s
[5406.25s -> 5412.15s]  movies. Just go watch them all. I promise you won't be disappointed. They're just outrageous
[5412.15s -> 5418.38s]  with how talented and the martial arts are. They don't make them like that anymore and I will say
[5418.38s -> 5426.22s]  that. They don't make them like that anymore. They really don't. Go ahead. Say it. Go ahead.
[5426.22s -> 5437.10s]  They don't. Batches me. Go ahead. They don't make them like that anymore. John Wick? John Wick is
[5437.10s -> 5444.22s]  John Wick is good. John Wick is very good but I still don't think I still think the old Jackie
[5444.22s -> 5452.86s]  Chan movies are are better. I do. John Wick is awesome but I still think that those old Jackie
[5452.86s -> 5462.15s]  Chan movies are are just they're the greatest of all time. They're yeah and it's like it's kind of
[5462.15s -> 5484.02s]  unfair to compare them anyways. What was even in this chest? I don't know. I'm just picking stuff.
[5484.02s -> 5495.40s]  I've been putting it down now. It was money okay. I actually bad chested during the one of the I
[5495.40s -> 5501.85s]  think it was the third um the third John Wick movie. I actually was bad chesting. I was like
[5501.85s -> 5511.82s]  what the fuck? Whoa. Oh yeah. During Drunken Master I couldn't even have an emotion. It was just my
[5511.82s -> 5516.47s]  eyes were just glued to the screen. I didn't even have time to bad chest. It was like what the fuck.
[5516.47s -> 5541.53s]  This is unbelievable. My jaw can't even go down. Oh you know what what a really big difference
[5541.53s -> 5550.46s]  between John Wick and the old Jackie Chan movies are? Uh not very not a lot of firearms. The use
[5550.46s -> 5562.98s]  of like guns. It was mostly martial arts. Okay so what am I doing here? And some of the shit they
[5562.98s -> 5577.24s]  pull off in John Wick with the firearms is crazy right? It's hard to compare them. I just break
[5577.24s -> 5601.16s]  these? Take. Can I not push these out of the way? Vicious sickle. I have that's right. I have bombs.
[5601.24s -> 5639.94s]  Thought it's been too long. Okay what's going on here? Oh I didn't get this one. I need to draw.
[5639.94s -> 5663.21s]  I don't want to break it but I want to drop it. I hear some sparklies. Oh it's that. Yeah I've seen
[5663.21s -> 5682.70s]  Kung Fu Hustle. Kung Fu Hustle is awesome too. What made you want to hop on Zelda again? Immense
[5682.70s -> 5705.30s]  peer pressure by 30 to 40 000 people. Wait what's going on? You mean to tell me I opened up every
[5705.30s -> 5718.86s]  single one of them and the last one I opened was the right one? I'm sitting here looking for a
[5718.86s -> 5736.63s]  puzzle. All right let me eat some of these bananas. I need to. I didn't cook. I forgot to cook. Uh oh.
[5736.63s -> 5746.55s]  I hope there's nothing that dangerous in here. Oh shit someone's in there. What are you doing here?
[5746.55s -> 5751.99s]  This is the hideout of those Yiga thieves who stole the thunder helm. If they spot you they'll
[5751.99s -> 5755.96s]  call their friends for sure. There's no way you can take them all on. Only you had some way of
[5755.96s -> 5761.11s]  distracting them but I don't know how. All I ever see them do is patrol and eat bananas. I haven't
[5761.11s -> 5769.02s]  seen anything else that you could exploit as a weakness. Poison the bananas. Poison the bananas.
[5769.02s -> 5799.99s]  I played enough Hitman. Okay. I don't know what weapon to use. They all seem too good. What do I
[5799.99s -> 5808.07s]  use? I don't know what to do. Oh you have emote only ma. Oh no. But I don't want to break a good
[5808.07s -> 5872.84s]  weapon. Whatever I'm gonna use this. No I'm not. I'm gonna use. I'm just gonna use the torch. It's
[5872.84s -> 5894.46s]  not an instant kill. I just wanted the treasure. Just give me the chest. What's in it? Oh a sapphire.
[5894.46s -> 5912.98s]  Oh my god this banana is right there. I know what to do. I know what to do. I know what to do.
[5920.14s -> 5945.67s]  All right so I have to shoot the bananas down. They probably go for the bananas. All right so
[5945.67s -> 5959.21s]  bananas are on this side over there. Look at the bananas. What are you doing? I'll take them if
[5959.21s -> 5991.80s]  you don't. Open them. What are you doing? Oh you're gonna eat the banana? Is it here? This sound?
[5991.80s -> 6016.98s]  All right this sound. Dude what the? I'm doing this because fuck this place. Oh my god never mind.
[6017.06s -> 6078.74s]  You see the banana? Get the fuck out of here. Get out of here. Oh fuck. Oh shit. Are you coming
[6078.74s -> 6153.38s]  over here? Is there any more bananas? Oh my god. What the fuck is going on here? Forced stealth
[6153.38s -> 6167.88s]  missions. Drop every game of full letter grid. That's the rule. I didn't make it. I just follow
[6167.88s -> 6190.28s]  the rule. So it's a good thing that uh Breath of the Wild started at 11. What just happened? Hey
[6190.28s -> 6195.88s]  can you help me? I don't know what I did but there's like people fighting me. Open that up.
[6195.88s -> 6211.37s]  Let me in there. Okay so bananas. Will you just stop playing? Stop playing around and kill me
[6211.37s -> 6229.56s]  already. Stop messing around and get get the job done. You're messing around. Thank you. So bananas.
[6229.56s -> 6236.92s]  I have a lot of them. Can I throw them? Can I just? Can I put them on the ground? Well that
[6236.92s -> 6266.28s]  does that work? Hold. It does work. Okay that fixes a lot of things. So this one should be,
[6266.28s -> 6277.13s]  I just need to have patience. Come on I gotta do one of the virtues. Prove that I'm a virtuous
[6277.13s -> 6303.05s]  streamer. Patience. Temperance. Shut up. That's lame. I'm telling you there's not, there's one
[6303.05s -> 6313.50s]  thing a gamer doesn't want to hear in a game. It's this. Nobody wants to hear that.
[6317.02s -> 6323.88s]  Oh nobody wants to hear that in any game. Where'd they go? Okay all right. Just I don't want to
[6323.88s -> 6355.88s]  waste the bananas. The bananas just dropped next to you. Bananas are next to you. How did you not
[6355.88s -> 6370.14s]  want to eat those? If I kill them does it just, can I just skip this whole section if everybody
[6370.14s -> 6382.63s]  here dies? Yeah? All right let's go. I'm taking out the fucking royal claymore for this one.
[6382.63s -> 6437.56s]  No I'm not. I'll use this. I don't, what is, where am I? Okay cool. Just hold five of them.
[6437.56s -> 6446.90s]  I'm just gonna throw a handful of these on fucking ground. Look what I got. I came to the potluck.
[6446.90s -> 6462.82s]  Here look what I, look at this. Okay I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I could have killed him if I didn't
[6462.82s -> 6490.62s]  have the fucking torch equipped. I'll do it for real this time. This part sucks. I'm glad
[6490.62s -> 6494.06s]  my face cam isn't on. Actually let's turn it on for a second so you can see probably how red I am.
[6494.06s -> 6517.77s]  Oh my god. I hate this. So I just want to play the game. I hate like, oh sneak. Oh wait. Wait a
[6517.77s -> 6521.53s]  second. Wait hold on. Wait for them to walk around the corner. Oh I hate these in games.
[6582.60s -> 6606.07s]  Shit. Oh that's the fastest way to die. Go get out of here. I'm never gonna be able to do this.
[6606.63s -> 6613.59s]  This is gonna be worse than the forest. Bro I didn't even pick up the bananas. I'm so flustered
[6613.59s -> 6622.76s]  right now. Did I? I'm so flustered I didn't even realize that I did pick up the bananas and I got
[6622.76s -> 6626.66s]  mad because I didn't think I'd picked up the bananas but I already picked them up. That's next level
[6626.66s -> 6676.04s]  tilted. All right just wait. Let's just sit here for 25 minutes while he walks around. Go get it.
[6676.04s -> 6709.38s]  Okay back here again. How did that miss? I want to get that but I don't even care. Why does he not
[6709.38s -> 6733.61s]  see it? The banana's right next to you. What's going on? Is this bugged? What's happening here?
[6733.61s -> 6779.42s]  Are you gonna see it now? That was dumb. You didn't, this guy see me? What the fuck is happening in
[6779.42s -> 6814.17s]  this video game right now? I don't give a shit. I'm going. I'm gonna use the royal claymore. I'm
[6814.17s -> 6826.06s]  not fucking around anymore. Holy shit that's the absolute. I just, I got their whole stash. Oh my
[6826.06s -> 6833.48s]  goodness gracious. All right can you guys help me? Am I missing an item or something? Because
[6833.48s -> 6876.22s]  like this seems impossible. No? My armor is loud. I'm gonna fucking take it off. I feel like I'm
[6876.22s -> 6885.30s]  making the same amount of sounds I wore earlier. I'm looking at the sound meter. The purple line
[6885.30s -> 6919.37s]  that's still bad. The weapons too? I don't think that's doing anything. All right so what the hell
[6919.37s -> 6932.30s]  happened here? This doesn't really sense. Here's your banana. Go get it. Why are you looking at me?
[6932.30s -> 6978.60s]  Is anybody up here? Is somebody gonna see me up here? I hope not. I got your whole stash. Fuck all
[6978.60s -> 7003.54s]  of you. Yeah I'm gonna watch this. Okay where do I need to go? That's where I died. I gotta go
[7004.10s -> 7025.80s]  across that way right? This is gonna be a really ballsy move. What are you fucking talking about?
[7025.80s -> 7039.26s]  Get up there. No! Why didn't I jump? Why didn't I go up? What? Are you fucking shitting me?
[7039.26s -> 7068.78s]  Why couldn't I climb over that? You gotta be fucking kidding me. Why couldn't I climb up the
[7068.78s -> 7073.96s]  lip? It's not like it was any different than any other lip in this whole game so far. What is this
[7073.96s -> 7129.51s]  shit area? Why did you make me come here? This sucks. The sounds and shit too. They can hear you.
[7129.51s -> 7134.52s]  They can see you. They can see you from across the whole fucking map. This motherfucker right here
[7134.52s -> 7139.48s]  sees me every time I shoot the banana down on the right side which is in my brain. It's hey
[7139.48s -> 7164.62s]  go look there's a banana over there. He don't care. He doesn't care. Huh? What's this guy's deal?
[7164.62s -> 7180.98s]  Why won't he go to the banana? It's right there dude. Go get that banana. No no no no do not put
[7180.98s -> 7188.98s]  a bomb down. Whatever you do please don't put the bomb down. Oh fuck I have to put the bomb down.
[7188.98s -> 7197.02s]  Shit. Wait. Wait. Can I magnetize the banana? There's radiation in those fucking things.
[7197.10s -> 7206.42s]  I definitely can't. Oh my god there's another banana right there. He's gonna see this.
[7216.89s -> 7229.48s]  Try this again. I'm looking at mod chat. One of the mods said this is the port of the game
[7229.48s -> 7251.19s]  where I left and never came back. Baby rage. Baby rage. I'm glad there's no face cam on
[7251.19s -> 7263.02s]  because that looked weird. I almost snapped my controller at this part. I had to take a break.
[7263.02s -> 7275.54s]  Oh no. I have an idea. Let's just be. I just got like a hundred bananas. Why would I not do this?
[7275.54s -> 7324.79s]  Is anybody even over there? Shit. Oh dude this just there's no safe place to go. Please don't
[7324.79s -> 7329.58s]  turn around. Please don't turn around. Please don't turn around. Okay I'm okay right here.
[7329.58s -> 7338.86s]  Now I'm gonna throw a bunch of bananas over here. Sit down. You can't hold that here.
[7338.86s -> 7349.75s]  What are you talking about dude? Which way is he gonna go? Which way is he gonna go?
[7349.75s -> 7358.81s]  Is he going this way? Is somebody over here? Why? It's okay. I'm all right. I'm gonna get to
[7358.81s -> 7378.58s]  the ladder. If he doesn't go for one of those bananas I'm gonna scream. I don't even. I don't.
[7378.58s -> 7384.20s]  That could be a legendary item. The master sword could be in that chest. I don't care.
[7384.20s -> 7425.11s]  I don't want it. I'm kind of concerned right now though. Okay please tell me I did it right.
[7425.11s -> 7451.19s]  I'm going. I'm going. Oh no. Oh my god. Are they here? Nobody comes in here right?
[7451.19s -> 7515.37s]  Just happened. Whoa. What the hell was that? Tapaz. What's a tapaz? Thank god. Like in Diablo
[7515.37s -> 7540.79s]  2. Diablo. What's Diablo? Diablo? Who the heck are you and what are you doing in my napping spot?
[7540.79s -> 7554.22s]  Wait a minute. A thing on your hip. Is that a sheikah slate? If that's a sheikah slate then that means
[7554.22s -> 7563.21s]  that means it's you. You're that link guy I've been looking for. What luck. My scouts are out in the
[7563.21s -> 7571.93s]  field looking high and low but you just wander into my hideout. Oh excuse me. I haven't introduced
[7571.93s -> 7590.04s]  myself yet. I'm the leader. I'm strong. I'm burly. The one. The only. Master Koga. Prepare yourself.
[7590.04s -> 7623.62s]  Okay bye. I was gonna see you again. No. No. No. Better. Come on. I gotta get better than that.
[7623.62s -> 7631.64s]  That's good. Oh look at all the crystals around him. No. No. Keep the old picture.
[7635.62s -> 7652.78s]  Oh my fucking god damn it. Get me out of this. I'm sure I use this as a weapon.
[7654.09s -> 7710.55s]  Freezing frost blade. I can't turn that into ice. What just happened? He dropped it on his head.
[7726.86s -> 7741.02s]  Uh oh. Double. Where do they go? Just fly at you.
[7741.50s -> 7789.13s]  Hmm. Oh no. No. No. No. No. No. No. I know. I know. I know. I know. Close. Yeah.
[7793.72s -> 7841.54s]  Same deal right? A little late. Phase three. It's a big one. When does he drop it?
[7841.54s -> 7874.58s]  Okay so it's tethered to him. Ha ha ha ha. Hmm. Again? That's pretty easy. Just fun though.
[7878.14s -> 7881.67s]  You think I'm just gonna let this stand? Do you?
[7881.67s -> 7890.54s]  You? I almost lost my temper there. What a pain. I can't go out this way. What to do? What to do?
[7892.31s -> 7899.13s]  He hates this game. Why didn't you just use the bow? What do you mean?
[7906.06s -> 7927.96s]  I need my serious moves. This is the end. That was infuriating. You're gonna be alright.
[7929.37s -> 7941.94s]  You'll be alright. You're gonna be fine. Pretty soon you'll be gone and not just from my light
[7941.94s -> 7948.84s]  of sight. Only the leader of the Yiga clan can use this secret technique. It is the- Oh no.
[7952.86s -> 7962.84s]  His own creation? Killing him in the end? All the hubris? All the arrogance? Who could have seen
[7962.84s -> 7984.04s]  that coming? If only he had temperance and patience. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[7984.04s -> 7990.36s]  What's in it? Yes. I can't wait to open this. Yes. What's in here? God. Okay. Calm down. What's in
[7990.36s -> 8017.16s]  here? Freshest Gerudo heirloom. Reclaimed from the Yiga. Hooray. Yeah. No, I didn't. Alright. Now we
[8017.16s -> 8046.39s]  can go all the way back here. Right? We have to bring this back. Let's go save it. Yeah. Jeremy,
[8046.39s -> 8053.93s]  you can just stop playing. It's okay. What did I say? A full letter- I said it was an 11 so a full
[8053.93s -> 8065.77s]  letter grade down would be a 10. I'm also saying that to all the Nintendo fans. Don't, uh, don't
[8065.77s -> 8079.80s]  murder me. I'll bring this shit down a full letter grade. I just heard- I heard like the
[8079.80s -> 8098.63s]  pitchforks get grabbed. Like off the fucking castle wall. Okay. Do you think it's a B?
[8103.10s -> 8123.06s]  I think it's better than a B. I think this is definitely an A. I don't know what kind of A.
[8123.62s -> 8151.54s]  It could be an A minus. It could be an A just regular A. Am I not allowed in here? It feels
[8151.54s -> 8176.07s]  like a B game with you playing. Oh, okay. This is 100%. This is 100% at least a 90%. We'll see.
[8176.07s -> 8216.46s]  Have the heirloom. I would give it an 80, but I'm not Mr. Streamer. No, this is a great game.
[8216.46s -> 8235.75s]  Anytime I think a game is great, it go- it's a 90 at least. He hates it. No, I just hated that
[8235.75s -> 8245.45s]  section. I just hate stealth. Even in the game that's built around a stealth game, every time
[8245.45s -> 8255.91s]  I played Hitman, I sneak past the first guard and then just throw bricks, vases, and fucking
[8255.91s -> 8261.34s]  briefcases at people. I just can't- I just don't like them. I hate stealth games. I do. You can say
[8261.34s -> 8273.24s]  he hates- I hate stealth games. I hate them. I do? Fine. You got it out of me. I don't like them.
[8273.24s -> 8282.12s]  Fine. I don't like them. That's kind of good. Oh, I've been holding that in for like 10 years.
[8282.12s -> 8288.15s]  That feels good. What- I'm gonna get some more takes. How about- you know how I feel about this?
[8292.89s -> 8298.86s]  Just go off on just- how about this take? I don't give takes. No. No, thank you.
[8298.86s -> 8313.82s]  Your arrival in the midst of all this must be the work of Lady Urbosa. Please give me the helm.
[8313.82s -> 8334.95s]  Jerma, you only take you never give. You've got me fucked up today.
[8376.60s -> 8379.00s]  Boy, have the two of you been getting along all right?
[8381.48s -> 8390.04s]  It's okay, I know. Your silence speaks volumes. She gets frustrated every time she looks up and
[8390.04s -> 8395.64s]  sees you carrying that sword on your back. It makes her feel like a failure when it comes to
[8395.64s -> 8400.52s]  her own destiny. Don't worry, it's not like you carry blame in any of this. I didn't have
[8400.52s -> 8404.12s]  breakfast this morning. I can relax. Stomach's grumbling.
[8437.88s -> 8441.48s]  You be sure to protect her with your life.
[8441.48s -> 8445.08s]  The game's quiet, sorry. You guys are fucking crazy, I love it.
[8445.08s -> 8449.00s]  The night brings a chill. It's probably time we take her in.
[8450.30s -> 8452.54s]  Hmm. Or...
[8458.84s -> 8462.04s]  And I just turned it up! Oh my god!
[8466.46s -> 8470.30s]  Hey dude, the game's quiet. Did you say that so I would turn it up during the fucking lightning
[8470.30s -> 8494.34s]  part, dude? Oh my god, I'm so s- that scared the shit out of me. That was kind of weird.
[8494.34s -> 8506.50s]  I can't get this thing off.
[8506.50s -> 8518.34s]  I must find some way to stop that thing before it threatens my people. Of course I'll help.
[8525.61s -> 8529.53s]  Hearing a simple, confident pledge of support from you would be what puts me at ease.
[8529.53s -> 8538.41s]  You guys having a good time? You guys- one in the chat, you having a good time?
[8538.41s -> 8542.81s]  I'm seeing- I'm seeing way too many ones. I'm seeing way too many yeses.
[8542.81s -> 8547.64s]  That's a lot of yeses. I'm not all right with that.
[8547.64s -> 8562.42s]  You guys having a good time right now? I'm not into that.
[8562.42s -> 8566.26s]  I'm so fucked up right now, I don't know why. Something's in the water today.
[8566.26s -> 8575.51s]  I need to get the sand seal. The lookout post isn't too far from town,
[8576.15s -> 8579.35s]  but you should take a sand seal there and get some practice in that way.
[8579.91s -> 8596.25s]  Okay, get a sand seal. I like that water.
[8596.25s -> 8604.46s]  Oh, another thing about Puss in Boots. Did anybody else feel this way? I know
[8605.62s -> 8611.61s]  Holly and I talked about it, but I- so much stuff in that movie just looked so delicious.
[8612.33s -> 8616.54s]  This looks like a popsicle. Like a glowing popsicle.
[8625.99s -> 8638.92s]  This dude's on another planet right now.
[8639.40s -> 8647.62s]  I promise I didn't just do a bong rip, but it's pretty suspicious considering the next thing I
[8647.62s -> 8655.30s]  said. I wanted to eat a majority of the Puss in Boots movie. That's very- I understand that that
[8655.30s -> 8672.95s]  sounded a little- a little suspicious. I need to cook. I need to- where can I cook?
[8672.95s -> 8682.54s]  I have a lot of ingredients. I'm not going to the divine beast until I cook. Where can I cook?
[8682.54s -> 8698.65s]  There's gotta be a stove around here somewhere, right? Why is it- there's gotta be a stove.
[8700.04s -> 8713.69s]  Every town has a stove. Is it near the stairs? Ow! That hurt a lot. I hope that wasn't too bad.
[8714.41s -> 8743.00s]  I don't know. Where is it? Near the stairs, you said? I scratched my nose and I scraped
[8743.00s -> 8757.00s]  the microphone accidentally. Sorry about that. What? Phrasing. Very poor choice of words.
[8757.64s -> 8803.10s]  What? This fucking bong fell over. I can't drink this, so. Can I cook here? You mean these stairs?
[8803.10s -> 8813.18s]  Left. I got it. Okay. What do I have for ingredients? And I kind of have- I forget how
[8813.18s -> 8817.62s]  this whole system works. Because you can make potions, but you can make food too. You don't
[8817.62s -> 8829.19s]  want to combine both of them. So, I can do a mushroom. I can do banana. What if I cook a
[8829.19s -> 8869.64s]  banana? Okay, there we go. What does cooking a banana do? Attack power boost? Okay, so that's
[8869.64s -> 8902.95s]  what that does. So, attack power. So you can only do one buff, so don't combine buffs. That's gonna
[8902.95s -> 8918.17s]  be pretty sick. There we go. Replenishes your stamina when cooked into a dish. So, this is a
[8918.17s -> 8928.36s]  stamina replenish. This is attack power. Banana is also attack power. Just go all in. Sort your
[8928.36s -> 8948.22s]  inventory. Any other attack power? I think this is all right. Yeah, I'll cook these. Maybe this
[8948.22s -> 8973.22s]  will be a big one. Whoa. High level attack power boost for four minutes. Good. One truffle. Maybe
[8973.22s -> 9004.42s]  a steak. Just one truffle. One truffle only. Ah, that's right. It's a full recovery. So,
[9004.42s -> 9027.02s]  I'm just gonna make a few of these. What about truffle and salt? Do I have salt? It's gonna be
[9027.02s -> 9092.06s]  a salty truffle. Why was that one worse? Too much salt. Okay, withstand cold. Probably four of these
[9092.06s -> 9105.29s]  and then something else too. Something like this. Yeah, it's gonna be a lot. 10 minutes of low level
[9105.29s -> 9137.51s]  cold. Not anymore. Electricity. Bitter cold. And then, how about a nutty seasoning? That's almost 11
[9137.51s -> 9162.25s]  minutes of mid-level cold. Okay. Electricity protection. Some salt. Another one of those.
[9162.25s -> 9183.13s]  And seasoning. Why do you sound like a wow streamer? I don't know. Oh, that's a huge raid.
[9183.13s -> 9195.18s]  Big raid. Massive raid. Welcome, everybody. That is a conner. That is a sea dog raid. Welcome,
[9195.18s -> 9205.58s]  everybody. Playing some Breath of the Wild. Thanks for the raid. Yeah, I turn the face cam on to say
[9205.58s -> 9215.43s]  hello. Sometimes. They get face cam and not us. You got it. I did it like three times already.
[9215.43s -> 9221.42s]  Oh, the moderation settings. Right. You can't say the. You can't say is. You can't say smelly.
[9221.42s -> 9229.82s]  You can't say sucks. You can't say he sucks. There's a lot of weird shit today. Just to let
[9229.82s -> 9234.60s]  you know. So be aware of that. There are some, there are a lot of things you just can't say today.
[9234.60s -> 9246.68s]  The mods are just having a chuckle. There's a hair on that. But anyways, hi. Thanks, conner.
[9246.68s -> 9261.96s]  If you don't follow Sea Dog, please do it. He's a gentleman. Scholar. Wonderful, wonderful man. Go
[9261.96s -> 9276.60s]  follow. You got nice hair. Hey, thanks. Temperance and chastity. We don't talk about that when new
[9276.60s -> 9304.42s]  people show up. This is stamina. Stamina. Is there any more stamina stuff? Oh, that is electricity.
[9304.42s -> 9316.79s]  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't see it as food. Defense. More hearts. All right, we're doing stamina.
[9316.79s -> 9342.94s]  Give me double meat and two salts. Let's go. This is attack power and then just salt. Whatever. Why
[9342.94s -> 9355.29s]  not? Yeah, for all conner, for all your viewers, we were talking about how all the seven deadly
[9355.29s -> 9364.68s]  sins get a ton of screen time, but the seven virtues do not. We went over it. Humility. Chastity.
[9364.68s -> 9384.12s]  Temperance. Patience. Diligence. What are the other two? Charity. Sin. Dude, they're all gone by now.
[9386.41s -> 9414.74s]  No! Who banned that person for fucking 10 minutes? Mid-level electricity. Very good. I think I'm
[9414.74s -> 9452.82s]  going to need those, so good. Kind of out of ingredients. What? I would love to hear your
[9452.82s -> 9458.66s]  opinion on macaroni and cheese. This person's name is macaroni and cheese or something.
[9458.66s -> 9475.67s]  Um, what do you mean? Do I like it? I mean, I love macaroni and cheese. It's great. All right,
[9475.67s -> 9487.43s]  I'm good for now. My opinion's on macaroni and cheese. It depends on who's making it.
[9487.43s -> 9492.17s]  I've had some runny ass macaroni and cheese before. That was awful. I've had some really,
[9492.17s -> 9500.17s]  really good macaroni and cheese. That was creamy. Delicious. Do you want me to tell you what my,
[9500.25s -> 9503.13s]  you want to know my absolute number one mac and cheese? Is that what it is?
[9511.85s -> 9524.79s]  Um, okay. My favorite mac and cheese. You're not going to say Velveeta, are you? No.
[9525.43s -> 9547.34s]  What's happening to me? Is it cold or? It's cold. Okay. Too cold? How cold is it? I'm still this
[9547.34s -> 9574.55s]  cold? Can I just make some shit? I could have eaten that stealth food. Um, these are all too
[9574.55s -> 9591.37s]  valuable. This is too valuable. All right. Hold the fire sword. Holy shit, that actually works.
[9591.45s -> 9600.92s]  I thought you were lying. Um, yeah, macaroni and cheese is great. I'm a big fan of a multiple
[9600.92s -> 9611.45s]  cheese macaroni and cheese. I'm, I don't know if I would put breadcrumbs on the top, although I
[9611.45s -> 9623.00s]  have to be in the mood for it. I do not like mac and cheese that is runny. If it's runny,
[9623.00s -> 9631.27s]  get it away from me. The cheese needs to be sticking to the noodles. I don't want it running
[9631.27s -> 9642.65s]  off. And they also, I don't want that much cheese. Some people load it up with, oh, gooey, gooey,
[9642.65s -> 9647.74s]  cheesy, right? No, no, no. It's like too much. It's kind of gross. Don't overdo it with cheese.
[9647.74s -> 9656.28s]  It's a little too much. I like it light. I don't want to have a heart attack after I take a bite.
[9656.28s -> 9682.06s]  Oh damn. Golden bow. Is this yours? What do I get rid of? I don't know what to get rid of.
[9682.06s -> 9700.36s]  One of the duplex bows. What cheeses though? Uh, cheddar, maybe Havarti. Swiss cheese can work
[9700.36s -> 9706.23s]  there. Pepper Jack works there. Honestly, you could just do whatever you want. Most cheeses
[9706.23s -> 9735.10s]  go pretty well together, except no goat cheese. Disgusting. I'll put a lookup post. Okay. What
[9735.10s -> 9744.66s]  about cottage cheese? Cottage cheese is fine. Ooh, that's really cool looking. Um, cottage cheese
[9745.61s -> 9753.34s]  with a little bit of cracked, just pepper all over it is pretty good. Gouda is really good.
[9753.34s -> 9763.43s]  I actually am not a big fan of brie. I don't like soft cheeses really. Cottage cheese and pepper.
[9763.43s -> 9776.23s]  Try it one day, then come back and report. All right, we're doing another divine beast. Let's go.
[9776.23s -> 9789.78s]  The sand seals to get in really close to that thing. I'll take the lead. I like feta, but feta
[9789.78s -> 9815.35s]  is not goat cheese. Shoot at its feet with bomb arrows. Not. It can be. I know the difference.
[9815.35s -> 9836.26s]  Staying close to not get shocked. Retreat. Not. She said, wait, here's not many. You gave me 20.
[9836.26s -> 9853.18s]  Feta is sheep. So I'm sorry, everybody. Feta is not goat. It is sheep. All right. Stop asking me
[9853.18s -> 9868.15s]  my opinions of cheeses. You're trying to derail the whole day. I need bomb arrows. I should
[9868.15s -> 9895.96s]  probably put the other bow on. I built a computer one time like 10 years ago and it made that sound
[9895.96s -> 9902.92s]  when I turned it on and I turned it off, unplugged it from the wall and cried. It's a true story.
[9910.42s -> 9915.46s]  It was a little longer than 10. It was probably, I don't know how long ago, maybe 15,
[9915.46s -> 9934.20s]  more than 15 years ago. I don't remember. Why would you cry? Because I don't know,
[9934.20s -> 9938.84s]  I like saved up a bunch of money and I'm going to build a computer and I put it all together
[9938.92s -> 9947.77s]  and it was just like, and it took like all day. It just was like overwhelming fucking sadness.
[9947.77s -> 9957.82s]  I couldn't help it. I was just like, this sucks. I'm fucking so sad. Yeah. Who wouldn't cry for
[9957.82s -> 9969.26s]  that? Are you kidding me? That's what a disaster of a day. I want to take out a different bow
[9969.26s -> 10000.90s]  because this shoots multiple arrows. What's going on? What's going on? Wait, there's a shrine. Why
[10000.90s -> 10015.59s]  am I having so much trouble controlling this? It only shoots. Oh, okay. Is that what I want though?
[10016.15s -> 10072.81s]  How do I put this down? Okay. You play games like a Midwestern mother. Okay. Let's go. That was
[10072.81s -> 10086.46s]  really fast. Wow. That was really good. So good. Midwestern mother, huh? But why don't you just go
[10086.46s -> 10095.54s]  upstairs and go to bed? Don't you know? I will not be hearing any more of that. I will not be hearing
[10095.54s -> 10117.77s]  any more of that. Fortunately, no choice but to entrust the rest to you. It's Canadian. Oh boy.
[10117.77s -> 10125.78s]  Yeah, you betcha. That's not Canadian. It's not, it's not Canadian. That's mid, it's Midwest.
[10125.78s -> 10140.82s]  I'm having trouble because all I can hear is the audio. That's Minnesota, Wisconsin. That's
[10140.82s -> 10153.94s]  Northern Midwest. It's still the Midwest. Minnesota. It's Northern Midwestern. I can't say
[10153.94s -> 10196.79s]  Northern Midwestern and say it's not Midwestern. Soda. What happened? Oh no, this looks tricky.
[10210.12s -> 10236.94s]  Somebody said this is the hardest divine beast. Okay. I think I held on to this. I need more
[10236.94s -> 10246.98s]  weapons. So badly. I need more weapon slots. Get rid of this torch. Don't you have to destroy
[10246.98s -> 10257.64s]  this stuff? Shoot the eye or something, right? Okay. So where are we going? This level is going
[10257.64s -> 10296.60s]  to make me puke. Oh man. I don't like that. The background moving like that. Okay. Electricity
[10296.60s -> 10339.00s]  field. Maybe. No, you guys have been good. Put it on. One. I need a map. What's with the horror
[10339.00s -> 10380.55s]  music? It's like scary music. Ancient battle acts. I'll take it. What was that? This brightness is
[10380.55s -> 10402.47s]  so bright. Well, they want me to have 50 of these for some reason. So I guess I'll hold on to it.
[10402.47s -> 10453.98s]  Wait, can I shoot through here? I don't think so. Nope. Whoa. I climbed this. Go down there.
[10454.62s -> 10483.26s]  Let's check the other side. I lost the weapon, but whatever. All right. What about here?
[10484.22s -> 10516.25s]  Can you stop mashing the piano, please? Stop going like this on the piano where you just take all
[10516.25s -> 10527.16s]  your fingers and just smoosh down. That gets you thrown out. That gets you thrown out, by the way.
[10527.16s -> 10536.26s]  I don't care where you are. I don't know if you're in a house. If you do that, you're getting thrown
[10536.26s -> 10548.50s]  out. This is going to happen. Just don't do that. You could be having a very, very normal conversation
[10549.83s -> 10555.11s]  hanging out. Oh, hey. Oh, you got a piano? Oh, cool. We open it up.
[10558.39s -> 10564.20s]  Someone's coming in that room and going, get out. Get out. I don't, I don't want you here anymore.
[10564.20s -> 10587.29s]  Get out. No, it's time for you to go home. All right. The thing obviously spins, but how do I spin
[10587.29s -> 10610.18s]  it? I had to get up there, up there. Oh, I can go that way. No, I can't. I think I can make it from
[10610.18s -> 10624.92s]  here. Let's try it. Okay. Dude, what the hell is going on here? I got to get over there.
[10625.64s -> 10662.82s]  Oh, fuck. I went the wrong way. Did I? Oh, okay. Good to know. Ancient spring. I can't believe bald
[10662.82s -> 10683.75s]  coin is still an emo. I never deleted it. I could have gone out that way, but whatever. No, no.
[10685.83s -> 10719.58s]  The most that emo has been used in five years. Oh, now I get the map. Okay. Oh, I have to,
[10719.58s -> 10729.72s]  I can rotate it. So the middle is a cylinder that spins. Good work getting the map of the divine.
[10729.72s -> 10736.26s]  The terminals that control are noted by a series of glowing points on your map.
[10736.26s -> 10742.30s]  Take no borders back by activating all of the terminal. You're ready for this. Who's talking
[10742.30s -> 10776.95s]  to me? Okay. Rotate 90 degrees. Execute. Right. I can do this one. All right. Do I have to do all
[10776.95s -> 10786.50s]  before this one? I can do this one now. Now this is the last one. Okay. So this one, um,
[10787.14s -> 10814.63s]  eh, shit. Whoa. This actually, wait a minute. Okay. Where is this one? It's right there. Okay.
[10814.63s -> 10843.69s]  Here we go. All right. Let's go. There are four terminals remaining. I'm counting on you.
[10843.69s -> 10873.02s]  I probably get this one right now. What about this one? Can I pull it?
[10884.81s -> 10920.68s]  Shit. Should have froze it. Freeze time. God damn it. All right. This is like fucked up out here.
[10981.91s -> 11004.26s]  I forgot I got that one already. It's blue. How do I spin that around?
[11005.06s -> 11034.49s]  Okay. How do I spin this? There's electricity up here, which I'm imagining
[11034.49s -> 11047.03s]  if the government make it go across the whole thing. I don't know. What are you doing all like
[11047.03s -> 11120.98s]  this for? What did that do? I, you know what happened. I don't even need to tell you what
[11120.98s -> 11144.34s]  happened. Okay. So I want to go up there or maybe down. Maybe I tried this way. I'm just going to,
[11144.34s -> 11154.78s]  okay. I got to, I got to explore now that I know that I can do that. Damn it. How do I get in here?
[11154.78s -> 11174.57s]  There's a hole in the top. All right. All right. All right. All right. I know what to do.
[11174.57s -> 11212.62s]  There's a hole at the top. I'm going to get up and through the hole. Maybe I should go this way.
[11216.50s -> 11271.00s]  What does this do? This needs to be electrified. All right. Okay. Well, at least I figured out what
[11271.00s -> 11301.35s]  it wants me to do. Electrify this to get the last one. I'm up here, but this is all the way up.
[11301.35s -> 11320.30s]  Can I climb from here? I have no idea. I have no freaking idea. The only thing I can think of
[11320.30s -> 11324.38s]  is to be in that hole. What happens if I do it again? Where does this hole go?
[11325.26s -> 11351.82s]  Can I stand on top of it or something? All right. I got to get out there.
[11352.46s -> 11365.06s]  Where's the hole? I'm going to do something really stupid. Give me a second.
[11365.70s -> 11376.20s]  That was stupid. It was really stupid. I just heard that right here.
[11377.16s -> 11418.42s]  Are there any moving parts? Can I stand on that or something? Hold on. No, I can't. Can I climb up?
[11418.42s -> 11475.21s]  Where does this other hole go? This thing is powered right now. Okay. I think my chat just
[11475.21s -> 11510.97s]  crashed. And my chat crashed. Am I still live? I'm just going to act like I am. Wait, the stream
[11510.97s -> 11541.85s]  turned off? That's weird. I don't have any drop frames or anything. Now I can see you. Maybe I
[11541.85s -> 11578.22s]  can't. My Twitch is fucked up. My internet's fine. I have no access to chat. Well, come on.
[11578.22s -> 11594.79s]  Come on. Come on. Where are you? We heard you make a puke sound and then it stopped.
[11595.67s -> 11604.12s]  Yeah, I got no drop frames. That's weird. What are you doing? What are you doing? What's going on?
[11604.92s -> 11658.50s]  What the hell? Did I- I fucking bumped it. Give me the elevator. What? Oh, no. My chat's back.
[11658.50s -> 11672.49s]  Okay. Everyone's saying not like this. Did I do it in the wrong order? I got it. It's right here.
[11673.05s -> 11690.78s]  We're good. Jump right now to prove you have free will. Time that person up for 20 minutes. Wait,
[11690.78s -> 11701.91s]  the stream crashed again. Maybe Twitch is having problems. All right. There are- All right. I got
[11701.91s -> 11727.96s]  to get up there. All right. That's that. Whoa. Should we pin a message saying refresh? Maybe
[11727.96s -> 11746.34s]  for a few minutes. Yeah. I think they see it now. All right. Good. All right. Only two more. The
[11746.42s -> 11758.17s]  last two are up. One is across that way. Let me see. So on the other side, on the same level
[11758.17s -> 11785.53s]  that I'm at right now. What the hell is this? I need electricity in there. Oh shit. Really?
[11787.08s -> 11801.02s]  What had happened? What just happened? Wait, what? I- Oh, I spun it accidentally. We're good.
[11801.02s -> 11833.45s]  We are good. We need to power it again. Anything over here? Get rid of that. Okay. I need to get
[11833.45s -> 11862.49s]  power there. Radishes? Sounds good. Okay. There's a bunch of shit this way. I did that. All right.
[11862.49s -> 11879.06s]  What about over here? I gotta be very careful. Fuck. Did you just hear what I said? I said be
[11879.06s -> 11889.93s]  careful and you just didn't do it correctly. Now what? I just slipped right off. It was- I don't
[11889.93s -> 11903.46s]  think you can walk on that. Where's the eye? Is there no eye on this one? I'm kind of screwed,
[11903.46s -> 11959.40s]  aren't I? Shit. What is going on? What is this? Is electricity here? What? This shit's all blocked
[11959.40s -> 11972.71s]  up now. Okay. I need to go up. Where am I looking right now? It's up there. I think I fucked
[11972.71s -> 12000.54s]  everything up. I was on the right track. I think I screwed it all up though. Damn it. Now I gotta
[12000.54s -> 12011.48s]  remember how to do this all again. I gotta turn the power back on, right? I don't know. I don't
[12011.48s -> 12032.14s]  know. That. Look at that. How do I get over there? Come on. How do I get in here? Come on, dude.
[12032.14s -> 12099.40s]  Really? I gotta drop from there. Hurry up. You can do them at the same time. Do I do them at
[12099.40s -> 12118.30s]  the same time or something? I wonder if that works. Okay. Power is back on. I can go that way
[12118.30s -> 12132.92s]  again. This shit is right next to me. Right here. How do I get up there? I'm gonna go back around.
[12132.92s -> 12150.06s]  I'm gonna go up and see if I can figure out how to get down there. Maybe I should go up there
[12150.06s -> 12169.08s]  through that hole. Where would that take me? Oh my god. Damn it, dude. I'm about to put a
[12169.08s -> 12219.42s]  fucking hole through my monitor. Sorry, I'm playing Breath of the Wild. Okay. Get out of the way. I
[12219.42s -> 12232.26s]  want to look. If I go up, I got an idea. I'm just gonna look. I just want to look. Don't press it.
[12241.58s -> 12248.28s]  I wish I could just rebind the keys because B is just A and A is B. Just let me rebind the
[12248.28s -> 12274.78s]  keys for the love of god. It's like three lines of code and I'm making that up because I'm
[12274.78s -> 12304.71s]  frustrated but I'm just saying it could be. I'm going all the way up. I'm going through that
[12304.71s -> 12370.04s]  fucking hole. No, I'm not. I don't know. I'm afraid to jump over here because I don't think
[12370.04s -> 12388.63s]  I'll make it. Look at that shit right there. What does this want to power? How do I get that to be
[12388.63s -> 12411.99s]  turned on? I turned that on. Can I pull it out? Can I throw a bomb at it? It needs to be powered
[12411.99s -> 12437.00s]  by something. I just don't know. I just don't get it. I mean, I kind of get it but how do I get on
[12437.00s -> 12446.50s]  the other side of this? I need to go from this direction to blow up the shit that's over there
[12447.30s -> 12481.90s]  and then power that somehow. Okay. This one is the grate that you have to fall into but I have to get
[12481.90s -> 12513.21s]  over there first. I have to get on this side of the beast. I'm fucking going for it. There's no eye.
[12514.01s -> 12545.61s]  Damn it. There's a hole there. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. How do I get? Okay, that's now- this
[12545.61s -> 12559.83s]  is now powered. Nobody move. Where is that? That's below- that's below me. Where is that elevator?
[12559.83s -> 12576.70s]  Where's that elevator? Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Am I- can I- am I in trouble here?
[12577.26s -> 12587.77s]  All right, that elevator is working and then down here and then- I don't know. So I just have to go
[12587.77s -> 12594.07s]  to the main room? Just go back to the main room and is there an elevator there now? I can't get out
[12594.07s -> 12630.60s]  this way. I'm seeing a lot of no's. Fuck. Up here first maybe? Up here through the thingy and then
[12630.60s -> 12640.12s]  down. Holy shit, it says to blame the stream for 20 minutes. The stream really did go down. Okay,
[12640.12s -> 12661.88s]  now how do I get this to go up? I just accidentally stepped off it. I didn't know- I didn't know there
[12661.88s -> 12670.73s]  was another lever. Another layer. I did not know this went up twice. That wasn't telegraphed
[12670.73s -> 12682.63s]  properly. That wasn't telegraphed properly. It was improperly telegraphed for sure. If I had known
[12682.63s -> 12711.69s]  this went up a second time I would have been fine. I should be close now. All right, what is that for?
[12711.69s -> 12786.20s]  I'm terrified to leave this area without knowing what that is. What does this do? So what? What the
[12786.20s -> 12793.56s]  hell does that even help me with? So I just- maybe I should just drop down. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12793.56s -> 12810.17s]  Let me go back and look at this. I think I can get the one in the crate because isn't it right
[12810.17s -> 12823.05s]  down here? What the hell is that? It's like a green ball. What on earth? What are you doing to
[12823.05s -> 12855.37s]  me here? Okay, what should I do with the ball? This is the back. Maybe there's something down
[12855.37s -> 12861.61s]  here. Can I do this? Then this way? I don't want to screw this up because I don't think this is
[12861.61s -> 12882.36s]  right. I think I need to get the ball. Do I need to bring the ball with me? I'm terrified to go
[12882.36s -> 12935.61s]  anywhere. That's what I was thinking. Give me this. Give me this. I fucking want it. I'll take it.
[12935.61s -> 12947.85s]  Dude, come on. Like, you know what I'm fucking aiming at. Like, fucking wet sock.
[12967.30s -> 12974.47s]  Yet, what is going on with- what is happening right now? I feel like I'm playing in quicksand.
[12975.03s -> 12996.36s]  All right, now where the hell do I bring this fucking thing? Down here, right?
[12996.36s -> 13016.34s]  No? This is wrong? That's wrong. Why did I pick this up? Bring it back up to the top, maybe?
[13017.06s -> 13026.94s]  What needed power that I couldn't- was the only thing I can think of.
[13027.90s -> 13071.99s]  What- what do I need to do with this up top? Is there actually something out here? I have no
[13071.99s -> 13085.99s]  fucking idea. This place is fucking crazy. Um, I don't- I don't remember what I'm- what I'm
[13085.99s -> 13098.97s]  supposed to be powering with this. I'm about to let you out so you can help. Let him out. Let him
[13098.97s -> 13119.66s]  out. Let him out. Let him out. What the hell do I do with this thing? You're so close. I know, but
[13119.66s -> 13130.47s]  one little mistake puts me back to the beginning. And I don't want to do that. You can rebind your
[13130.55s -> 13158.22s]  keys. That's the first thing everyone's screaming. Go rebind your keys. April fools. Do I take this-
[13158.22s -> 13170.66s]  I'm just going to carry this with me everywhere I go for now, for a minute. What- there's another
[13170.66s -> 13176.66s]  one right here. Why do they- why are there two of these fucking cube balls? Why are they two of- I
[13176.66s -> 13193.80s]  just brought it up to hang out with his fucking sibling. Should I take them both? I'm bringing
[13193.80s -> 13275.16s]  them both downstairs. They're both coming with me. No help. Just help me. Two balls of Bradley.
[13275.16s -> 13293.75s]  Can I take it off of this? Oh wait, okay. So it doesn't need to stay on there. I did it finally.
[13293.75s -> 13313.32s]  Need to go back and beat Lou three times at the Fox and Geese game. This one was fucked. I don't
[13313.32s -> 13318.50s]  like this one. This one was fucked up. I don't like this one at all. I don't like this one at all.
[13318.50s -> 13347.27s]  How do I get this out of the way? Power this and then open it. How do I open this? Don't crush me.
[13347.91s -> 13368.57s]  How do I drop down here? You can't get in from here? No bro, you gotta get swished.
[13377.43s -> 13385.50s]  Oh dude, I have to go out the side holes. I feel like I tried that and I couldn't get it to work.
[13386.14s -> 13391.70s]  So I'll just just go right down to the bottom, like of the actual level. Just get out of here
[13391.70s -> 13425.94s]  and go to the- you don't need the balls anymore? Okay, so it's over here. Side holes. Maybe- can
[13425.94s -> 13456.47s]  I go up? I have no freaking idea and I just said a bad word. Okay, so if I go out there I can get it.
[13457.11s -> 13509.11s]  I got it. I got it. Hold on, let me spin the whole entire video game like three more times.
[13509.11s -> 13526.52s]  Get me out of here. Get me out of here.
[13541.93s -> 13549.50s]  I know where it is. System settings, controller settings, change button mapping.
[13549.50s -> 13560.78s]  I'll take a break and do it. All right, now I'm just gonna get to the front.
[13590.78s -> 13629.35s]  How's temperance going? We're going full wrath. This is the hardest boss you have fucked. There's
[13629.35s -> 13637.64s]  too many buttons in this game. There are too many buttons in this game. There are like 60 different
[13637.64s -> 13655.35s]  inputs in Breath of the Wild. There are too many buttons. There are far too many buttons. There's
[13655.75s -> 13674.94s]  so many fucking buttons. Relax. That's not what I wanted to do. I wanted to jump. This might be
[13674.94s -> 13680.70s]  the most inputs of any game I've ever played. There's like every button has a second context
[13680.70s -> 13727.78s]  rule button. There's like 40 inputs in Breath of the Wild. Good luck.
[13727.78s -> 13738.17s]  Good thing. Good thing I just used the divine strength on shooting myself with a bomb arrow.
[13739.45s -> 13808.47s]  Okay. Where the hell am I? Where the hell am I? Why did it put me all the way down here?
[13812.68s -> 13834.39s]  Excuse me. How do I get back up there? I gotta redo the whole thing. No, I don't. It was right
[13834.39s -> 13846.33s]  there. I'm about to eat my controller about how much I hate this part of the game. This
[13846.41s -> 13855.00s]  whole Gerudo Valley. If I do a second playthrough, I'm not coming over here ever again.
[13855.00s -> 13873.69s]  Where? Oh my god. What just happened? No, we're good. How come you don't drink beer on stream?
[13873.69s -> 13899.26s]  What are you talking about? Ah, let me get like a nice, like a nice cold beer. Oh, it goes up.
[13914.63s -> 13941.78s]  Okay, what? Should I use for weapon? Wait, my fucking album is full. God damn it, man.
[13942.74s -> 13963.13s]  Is this electricity? What kind of damage is he doing? Electricity? Oh, I do have- wait,
[13963.13s -> 13981.83s]  do I have the- why am I not wearing a helmet? What the hell happened? It's fire. Thunderblight.
[13981.83s -> 14016.22s]  I didn't read his name. He just fell off the whole game. This world was so long. All right,
[14016.22s -> 14022.82s]  do the- okay, so it's one, two, three, bang. So it's one, two, three, back. One, two, three,
[14022.82s -> 14047.14s]  back. Okay, faster than I thought. How did I not dodge that? Parry? What? I don't- it's been four
[14047.14s -> 14087.05s]  months, guys. What's the parry button? It's A with the shield out. A? I just did it. God. I'm
[14087.05s -> 14130.90s]  doing it my way. My shield's not out anymore. Jesus. All right, let's go. Oh shit, I need to
[14130.90s -> 14137.70s]  have a- it's gonna be a one-hander weapon. Do I have another one-hander?
[14162.65s -> 14172.73s]  Royal Claymore. Why not? Can I take my shield out without- I don't know how to do that. Do I
[14172.73s -> 14184.46s]  have to have a one-hander? Or can I pull the shield out somehow? No, okay. I'm gonna have to
[14184.46s -> 14258.04s]  backflip over it then. Phase two. I don't even know where he is. Where is he? Put this fucking
[14258.04s -> 14263.24s]  camera down. Oh my god. Hold left bumper and then up and then hold left and then A and then right
[14263.24s -> 14286.46s]  bumper. Oh my goodness. Look what I have. What do I do with this? Do I just stick it in his face?
[14287.02s -> 14319.86s]  What do I do with it? Did I get him? You're reading chat? Sometimes. Very rarely. Um,
[14325.69s -> 14352.47s]  oh heck. I can't be on the ground. Yeah, rarely. Like when I'm fighting a boss. I just freaked out.
[14352.47s -> 14358.81s]  I thought he was jumping at me. Bro, you should get a ring light. I don't want- I have it. It's
[14358.81s -> 14391.38s]  just not turned on. All right, leave me alone. What? I can freeze him? Oh my god, dude. Oh my god.
[14400.06s -> 14416.47s]  Why would that help though? This doesn't hurt him. Put the ring light around your neck.
[14422.26s -> 14436.46s]  It does? What do you mean that one was a dud? I have to do it before he strikes it?
[14436.46s -> 14468.47s]  I don't even know where the hell this guy is. Fuck you. Dude, how many times does he swing?
[14469.43s -> 14481.26s]  Fuck. What the hell? I don't care about the low level stealth boost. I need the fucking hearts.
[14482.06s -> 14500.92s]  Where's my weapon? No, I'm- why don't you fucking strike some lightning down here?
[14500.92s -> 14514.86s]  Lady, I don't know who you're talking about. What direction is he swinging? You drop the
[14514.86s -> 14556.28s]  fucking weapon every time he hits you? Stop attacking. That shit is broken. Oh my god,
[14556.28s -> 14619.35s]  the damage is unreal. I just have to eat everything. Die. Yeah. That was really hard.
[14622.23s -> 14650.01s]  That was crazy. My eyes hurt. Yeah, that was cleric beast. What did I say? Delete this whole
[14650.01s -> 14692.23s]  part of the game. Heart container. It was genuinely a skill issue. That's all a skill issue. Two more
[14692.23s -> 14731.91s]  to the master sword. I'm looking forward to that. I was wearing metal armor. I lost so many points
[14731.91s -> 14735.90s]  believing tonight. I'm sorry.
[14748.92s -> 14757.59s]  Please accept this gift, which has come to be known as herbosa's fury. It will no doubt be of
[14757.59s -> 14780.39s]  use to you. That like, you don't hear that ever. Both you and the princess. I know you have suffered
[14780.39s -> 14787.46s]  much regarding what happened to us champions, but this is how things had to happen. No one need
[14787.46s -> 14794.89s]  carry blame. So please make it clear. So she understands that. Tell her to shed any worries
[14795.85s -> 14814.60s]  and let her know. You take good care of the princess. Oh, and also take good care of him.
[14814.60s -> 14824.78s]  Yeah. Bro, you're not even wearing. I was wearing metal armor and dying in like two hits.
[14825.42s -> 14833.06s]  I feel like every single thing that I could have done wrong, I did wrong during the last hour,
[14834.20s -> 14839.90s]  like everything to the things, the items I was wearing. So the strategy I had, I feel like I
[14839.90s -> 14855.90s]  was just doing every single possible thing incorrect for like 45 straight minutes. You did
[14855.90s -> 14889.27s]  it your way. Yeah. We'll take a break. Don't worry. It's still a 90. It's still an A. Don't worry.
[14889.27s -> 14908.09s]  I love people concerned. End of the stream. No, no, no. We'll go for like another hour.
[14924.23s -> 14933.27s]  Legend of the Gerudo celebrated over ages and you who were named to honor you are a legend as well.
[14934.07s -> 14948.26s]  Isn't that right? Yeah. Stream crashed halfway through defeat from a century.
[14948.26s -> 14958.76s]  It was written that calamity Gannon once adopted the form and that will make this victory all the
[14958.76s -> 14969.54s]  more satisfying. How much harder is the game if you just go right again? It's just like impossible.
[14970.18s -> 14982.57s]  We'll be up to link to keep Ganon occupied and is going to be so delicious.
[14982.57s -> 14991.94s]  Yes. You would cry on master mode. I cry on normal difficulty. I would probably agree with you.
[14996.76s -> 14999.72s]  I cried when I fried my PC. I cried at everything.
[15002.55s -> 15010.02s]  I cried in the end of Puss in Boots. I didn't even read what that said.
[15010.90s -> 15014.17s]  That was incredibly important and I have no idea what it was.
[15018.63s -> 15023.03s]  I cried at the end of Ghostbusters Afterlife. Guys, I cry at everything, okay?
[15023.67s -> 15046.86s]  Hold Y. Whoa. Hold it for longer.
[15051.69s -> 15053.85s]  And what scenario would you ever be able to hold it for this long?
[15055.77s -> 15081.77s]  Damn. Oh, okay. Hold on. It does 500 damage. Damn. Make sure it starts to recharge.
[15081.77s -> 15112.84s]  It's a good idea. Very cool. Oh, I can do that. It's gone forever. No, they recharge.
[15115.90s -> 15119.90s]  I'm going to take a quick break. Let's complete this quest and then I'm going to take a break.
[15120.54s -> 15136.68s]  We'll go for like another hour or two. Naboris is no longer a threat to the town.
[15136.68s -> 15139.88s]  I'm still worried about the larger threat to Hyrule, but at least my people won't be
[15139.88s -> 15152.81s]  troubled by Naboris anymore. Ooh. Two trinkets? Priceless treasures of the Gerudo people.
[15153.53s -> 15174.10s]  Only right that you should have them. Okay. Cool weapon. Wow. Simitar of the Seven. Nice.
[15178.44s -> 15192.39s]  Daybreaker. Very cool. Whoa. What can I get rid of? Why do I even have that?
[15199.85s -> 15230.20s]  Very cool. All right. So now where do I go now? Up here? Can I take that helmet?
[15231.42s -> 15280.39s]  Can I have it? Yeah, I want it. Yes. Lend it to me. Oh, I have to do side quests. So what's
[15280.39s -> 15313.53s]  going on here? Legendary rabbit trial. Look at the side stuff. Okay. So I could go up here.
[15313.53s -> 15321.90s]  I think I'm going to go here and go up, but I'll be right back. I'm going to take a first break.
[15321.90s -> 15608.01s]  I'll be back in maybe five minutes. See you in a sec. He was crying off camera.
[15610.41s -> 15621.43s]  Yeah. Remember, do you like Big Chungus? Big Chungus was in the Space Jam movie
[15621.43s -> 15627.90s]  for a half a second. Somebody told me that and then I thought they made it up.
[15627.90s -> 15632.70s]  I was like, there's no way that Big Chungus is in the movie. And Big Chungus is in the movie.
[15632.70s -> 15648.81s]  Did you cry when Big Chungus showed up? Yeah, I was so fucking moved. Like they had,
[15649.45s -> 15669.10s]  you know, it was very moving. What's this? Oh, it's this thing. Okay. I need my horse back.
[15670.76s -> 15686.01s]  Where is Frank too? Where are you Frank too? Over here. I need to go get Frank too. Thanks
[15686.01s -> 15722.62s]  for your opinion on Big Chungus. You're welcome. Put some armor on. All right. Let's actually go.
[15722.62s -> 15756.62s]  Where you at? What do you got? Okay. I'll take three of these. These are cheap. 10 rupees. That's
[15756.62s -> 15787.32s]  it? This is really cheap. Pretty cool. Okay. Can I teleport with the horse? Come on. We can't go
[15787.32s -> 15814.66s]  together. Well, looks like we're walking. Go to any stable and get it from there. I don't want
[15814.66s -> 15848.98s]  to walk all the way. Let's try this again. There's a saddle that lets you call your horse from
[15848.98s -> 15878.49s]  anywhere. Pretty good. Okay. I'll get it eventually. Wait, we can't go over here anyways. Wait,
[15878.49s -> 15887.30s]  am I going the wrong way? Why was that turned around? That was weird. I thought I was going
[15887.30s -> 15894.60s]  the right way. No horse in the desert. Yeah, that's right.
[15913.88s -> 15924.50s]  Vinny beats Jerma's time. Vinny beats Jerma's time. What is this? Vinny beats Jerma's time.
[15925.06s -> 15952.38s]  Playing Resident Evil 4. Dude, my connection to Twitch is like awful for some reason. Okay. Let's
[15952.38s -> 15983.21s]  see it. Bro, come on. What? Dude, how? How would you do that in two turns? No way. Wow.
[15984.97s -> 16000.47s]  You can actually do it in two spins. Hey, I ain't the only one that has trouble with this. I know
[16000.47s -> 16006.89s]  for a fact that there are a shitload of other people that just kind of, it's like, it's one
[16006.89s -> 16013.06s]  of those scenarios where if you do it wrong, yeah, you can do it in two turns. But if you don't do
[16013.06s -> 16026.81s]  it immediately correct, you fuck the whole thing up for like 10 minutes. Yeah. It's a shitload of
[16026.81s -> 16040.34s]  us. It's a shitload of us. And that's fine. That's so funny though. I did it in two turns by accident.
[16040.34s -> 16051.82s]  That's so funny. Chat told him you took forever. It's all right. That's so funny though.
[16057.38s -> 16076.06s]  Two turns. You would have taken forever. I did take forever. That already happened.
[16076.06s -> 16121.37s]  It's a reading chat. I'm not gonna buy this. Get this out of the way. Get the fuck away from me
[16121.37s -> 16170.79s]  and my horse. All right. Let's go. Made it. All bending. It's really pretty. I'm glad you're doing
[16170.79s -> 16176.31s]  no cam chill streams again. Yeah. I don't know if I would, I don't know if I would qualify this one
[16176.31s -> 16180.63s]  as that though. I feel like this got a little unhinged in the last couple hours I want to say,
[16181.51s -> 16183.45s]  but I agree with you. I do agree with you.
[16206.28s -> 16245.77s]  Nice. Deep freeze. What's up here? I think I already, yeah, I already was here. Oh, we good.
[16247.70s -> 16251.38s]  Imagine seeing that. If you're like, whoa, shit, that person almost just fell off.
[16251.38s -> 16259.02s]  That person's drunk up here. Not this girl. I'm talking about me.
[16267.51s -> 16270.31s]  He thinks I'm going to forgive him for this. He's got another thing coming.
[16274.55s -> 16295.06s]  I think I did most of everything here. Unless like, I don't know what's up there.
[16298.94s -> 16315.14s]  Play all the Final Fantasies. Nah, I'm really not into those games. Try to go up there.
[16316.02s -> 16332.78s]  Honestly, the only turn-based RPGs I really ever liked were the Chrono series. Chrono Trigger,
[16332.78s -> 16370.65s]  Mario RPG, Grenade. You okay? Oh, lift. By the goddess, I'm grateful.
[16375.85s -> 16384.38s]  Should I go back to that stable? Maybe I can collect a reward or something.
[16401.94s -> 16403.30s]  Just threw a barrel at me.
[16416.38s -> 16422.62s]  Play Roblox. April 5th, we're having a birthday party for, I don't even know who it is. I just
[16422.62s -> 16431.48s]  know we're having one. Are you coming to the birthday party? You're invited. It's on twitch.tv
[16431.48s -> 16462.95s]  slash germa985. That's what I heard. What the fuck? Oh my God. Don't do that. I thought there
[16462.95s -> 16465.51s]  was somebody in the room with me or something. I don't know. I just felt like somebody was in
[16465.51s -> 16471.56s]  my house or something. You know what I mean? Like someone's in my room. It's just jarring.
[16476.94s -> 16487.02s]  I'm just sitting here hanging out playing. She's like, hey, just want to let you know.
[16487.02s -> 16528.22s]  I'll stick with this. It's a long way. Oh my God. It was so scary. Hey, can I have a Minecraft
[16528.22s -> 16535.83s]  themed birthday party? It's May 13th. No, sorry. We're going to get through everybody's birthday
[16535.83s -> 16566.28s]  on the 5th. That's a chest. What about Splatoon birthday? No, we'll do a Roblox birthday on the
[16566.28s -> 16594.42s]  5th. So what was in here? A lot of work for five fire arrows. I don't want to go too far.
[16617.43s -> 16623.96s]  Oh my God. What am I doing? What is going on right now? I didn't want to use my weapons
[16623.96s -> 16630.55s]  because I've been breaking them. I broke like three in the last 10 minutes and I was afraid
[16630.55s -> 16638.92s]  to use them. What is going on with my brain at the moment? I don't want to break all my cool
[16638.92s -> 16645.03s]  weapons. So I'm like, I'll pick up the rock. And then that's all I remembered. I just woke
[16645.03s -> 16672.49s]  up a second ago. That's all I remember. How do they not see me? What? They didn't see me.
[16674.60s -> 16683.83s]  What just happened? I had an ice arrow. What? Okay. That was so confusing. Oh,
[16684.79s -> 16706.58s]  all right. Get the, get the bow out. Hold left, press right. Let go. I wish I could put arrows
[16706.58s -> 16745.56s]  on without having to be zoom the fucking. It's annoying. Let's go. I want to put a weapon on.
[16750.20s -> 16791.93s]  What the hell? I got a lot of health. Jesus. What do I get for this? Ooh.
[16802.04s -> 16803.48s]  Something like that came from a bathroom.
[16813.93s -> 16840.86s]  Give me my trinket. Change the bow. Did I not kill everything? Usually you kill everything and
[16840.86s -> 16892.62s]  something spawns, right? Hmm. Somebody still alive? No chest. Okay. Let's go. All right.
[16892.62s -> 16932.07s]  Just need to go this way. Hey, who are you? Okay. My partner, that's to say my horse ran off. And
[16932.07s -> 16940.25s]  hey, since I've been stranded here, I'll need a horse to continue my travels. I need a, if I
[16940.25s -> 16967.16s]  just had a horse. Does he want my horse? No. I don't, the brightness I don't think is the,
[16967.24s -> 16998.31s]  nothing on OBS. I don't have any filters on or anything. It's a radiant glow. This is not normal.
[17000.95s -> 17006.90s]  This is what I see through my screen too. HDR on. I don't think so.
[17020.50s -> 17023.48s]  It's like I just went through the windshield of a car.
[17023.48s -> 17062.06s]  Oh, where? Holy shit. I can't see anything. Oh my God. Is it over here? This is kind of ridiculous.
[17069.08s -> 17087.21s]  Is it in your game settings? I don't think so guys. No, I don't think so. There it is.
[17087.21s -> 17095.13s]  Oh my God. What about your, you need to buy a new switch. Hold on. What? Let me look at my,
[17095.13s -> 17113.06s]  you tell me go to my switch settings. Hold on a second. Screen brightness. Screen brightness
[17113.06s -> 17140.98s]  cannot be set while connected to a TV. Look, I can't change it. That's kind of weird. I don't
[17140.98s -> 17157.50s]  think I can do anything else with this. That's the switch. That's the actual switch brightness.
[17158.50s -> 17181.32s]  The screen on handheld mode. That's funny. No, it's not OBS because I have to capture the
[17181.32s -> 17197.86s]  console. Let me go to like my actual property properties. Let me see. Hold on. What if I do this?
[17201.90s -> 17224.02s]  That fix it? Is it better? Maybe a little. Yeah, I dropped my, I went into the actual capture card
[17224.02s -> 17247.77s]  and I dropped the brightness. It still is kind of, still is kind of crazy though. 13k versus 17k
[17247.77s -> 17252.62s]  earlier. Oh, my stream crashed. A lot of times people just don't come back. How much did I get
[17253.02s -> 17286.09s]  it? All right. What do we do here? On the move. We'll turn this on for now.
[17286.09s -> 17310.62s]  Am I, you're going to want to see my reactions when I fuck it up. Oh, wait, wait, wait, time.
[17311.98s -> 17314.38s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are we doing another one of these?
[17314.38s -> 17331.13s]  10 minutes? Are we doing a bet here? Okay. Well, I beat this in 10 minutes. By the way, I will,
[17331.13s -> 17409.34s]  when you say go, I will wait 10 seconds. I think that's fair. Ready? Three, two, one. Oh,
[17409.34s -> 17414.98s]  I'm deaf. There's no way I don't do this. All the doubters. I'm sorry, but you're about to get
[17414.98s -> 17595.18s]  wiped out. Let's get going. Fuck. Son of a gun. What are you? Wait, that actually worked.
[17607.48s -> 17611.08s]  Whoa. Whoa. That's coming from this side. It's coming from this side.
[17635.40s -> 17654.42s]  What do I have for time? Time check? I have five minutes. I'm just going to get up and just start
[17654.42s -> 17663.99s]  Fortnite dancing. Hey, all the believers from earlier that lost everything. Hope you got it
[17663.99s -> 17687.10s]  all back. Sorry doubters. The way it is. These are my favorite part about the whole game.
[17687.10s -> 17721.16s]  I have six orbs now, which lost everything. Why do you look so fucked up? Just chilling, man.
[17721.16s -> 17784.46s]  Very cool. So let's keep going over here. Oh, there's a little dungeon over here.
[17784.46s -> 17794.34s]  These need to explode. Get out of the way. Somebody move. I thought I was going to drop
[17794.34s -> 17833.56s]  the lantern. Get out of here. Oh, holy shit. What is hurting me so much right now?
[17834.28s -> 17856.87s]  I'm taking like times five damage. How am I getting hurt so bad? Out of food almost. Fire
[17856.87s -> 17904.97s]  burning you. How about now? Yes. The chest. Let's replace this one. Or is it time to get rid of one
[17904.97s -> 17935.18s]  of these? What do you think? Maybe get rid of the lizard shield. This thing just seems way better.
[17935.18s -> 17954.68s]  Oh, let's light this thing up. Jerma TWT thinks you look handsome today.
[17973.30s -> 17978.98s]  Oh, Twitter. T. I was like, what is T? I thought that was like some like imposter channel or
[17978.98s -> 17983.54s]  something like, oh, hey, Jerma TWT streaming right now. And I said, you look pretty good today.
[17984.92s -> 17999.75s]  What? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Come back. Come back. Come back. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
[18001.58s -> 18040.58s]  I'm so sorry. Going through his bones. Guys, he's going through his bones. That hurt so bad.
[18046.58s -> 18094.92s]  That was I need to relax. Geez, man. And spoils. No. I have something hidden in here.
[18095.48s -> 18114.76s]  Can you just admit that you hate this game? I don't think that's accurate.
[18115.48s -> 18165.19s]  How can you use lawyer talk? I think I'm just 40. I need to get some food now. I don't want
[18165.19s -> 18174.87s]  to waste all this good shit I have. A lot of this is high level, high level, mid level.
[18174.87s -> 18187.10s]  I need a town or something. Hmm. What should I eat? Whatever. I can cook more food. It's fine.
[18197.32s -> 18220.81s]  Canyon. Shrine. Which way? In the water? Jerma, do you have anything to say to your haters?
[18220.81s -> 18261.35s]  No. Oh, don't do this to us. No one's under any obligation to like this channel.
[18261.35s -> 18265.67s]  If you don't like this channel, then all right. It's on you. It's up to you.
[18268.15s -> 18291.24s]  And this is it. I'm so glad I had that. That's weird. I mean, if you go, hey,
[18291.24s -> 18307.51s]  this guy's a dickhead and then leave, then all right. Whatever. Oh dear. Hold on. Where's the shrine?
[18310.74s -> 18349.67s]  Under the bridge? There it is. Oh no. Wait, I think I'm okay.
[18349.67s -> 18376.02s]  Okay. Oh, pretty good cartoon laugh. That was a pretty good cartoon car.
[18378.79s -> 18385.11s]  I'm just running around with a bowl of cereal in my hands. It's like just children running after
[18385.11s -> 18408.09s]  me and I have a bowl of cereal running around. You guys want to bet? How are you guys doing on
[18408.09s -> 18410.81s]  the betting? No, it's a test of strength. Never mind. I'll do this pretty quickly.
[18413.59s -> 18448.71s]  They're magically delicious. Yeah. I don't even give them a chance.
[18458.81s -> 18486.06s]  I have some junk that I can get rid of, don't I? This is crap. It's in here. I should probably go
[18486.06s -> 18522.57s]  upgrade the slate, right? Can people still not write the word the? We cannot. Oh, well, you guys
[18522.57s -> 18540.31s]  have had to communicate in symbols all day anyways. This is a really funny prank. It's so funny. I'm
[18540.31s -> 18552.78s]  laughing. All right. You can take it off. Give them their freedom back. Give them all the words
[18552.78s -> 18568.22s]  back. Very nice. All right. I need to get back up. I could probably just go from here and just
[18568.22s -> 18592.34s]  jump off. What was the point of that? Because it's the funny day and I wanted to make chatting
[18592.34s -> 18605.56s]  unbearable, I guess, for some reason. I don't know. Okay. So how do I get back there quickly
[18607.59s -> 18635.13s]  I think that's just you being a prick. Is it really though? It's for like four hours one day
[18635.13s -> 18675.74s]  in April. Where's the horse? Yeah, but you were a prick for four hours. I guess that doesn't change
[18675.74s -> 18681.80s]  the fact that I was a dick for a few hours. That's right. Yeah, that's true. I don't think I want to
[18681.80s -> 18690.66s]  fight this. I'll be honest. I didn't even know it was still on. I was too busy being angry at Zelda.
[18725.10s -> 18740.87s]  Holy shit. Oh my goodness. I just annihilated this guy. This theme song didn't even get to play.
[18741.51s -> 18761.11s]  Can't hear any more of these. Ooh, wait a minute.
[18766.02s -> 18790.36s]  Wait, what was the bow? I don't know if I want to drop. Should I drop the golden bow?
[18790.36s -> 18810.20s]  I don't think anything I want to drop here. Soldier's bow. Nah. Nah, we're good.
[18810.20s -> 18859.67s]  I'm not picking up the signal anymore. Where is it? I need a tower.
[18863.46s -> 18894.41s]  The tower over there. That's really close to Ganon though. Ooh, a stable.
[18894.41s -> 18944.06s]  No, I want Frank too to be teleported here. Yeah, I'll get food too. But first I want to do this
[18944.06s -> 18953.14s]  shrine because then I will have the right amount of hearts to get the master sword. That's correct,
[18953.14s -> 18979.53s]  right? There it is. Yellow hearts don't count. How many do I have? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
[18979.53s -> 19006.02s]  11, 12. I'll have 13 because I have eight orbs. I'll have 13 after this. Make it look like a rave
[19006.02s -> 19013.13s]  is going on in your cam. I don't have any lights in here that could do that. I'm sorry to say.
[19013.85s -> 19061.00s]  Are we voting? 10 minutes. Let's see if I can do it. I'll pause it so I'm not looking. Timer is
[19061.00s -> 19127.22s]  ready. In three, two, one. All right. First of all, something to do with this, I bet. Okay.
[19127.22s -> 19230.46s]  Ball up there. Hmm. What is this? Oh, shit. Hold on. Ball. Ball goes over here. Could have worked.
[19230.46s -> 19246.52s]  Why would I be able to do that though? Should I climb? Wait, can I get up here? I thought it was
[19246.52s -> 19312.55s]  too shallow. Okay. I know what to do. Fuck. It goes the other way. It goes the other way.
[19313.43s -> 19326.74s]  I need arrows, dude. How am I supposed to do this without arrows? How do I get that back?
[19326.74s -> 19364.71s]  Flip it again. So now I throw it in here. Fuck you. God damn it. I wasn't close enough.
[19364.71s -> 19375.82s]  How was I not close enough? Now how am I going to get this out of the water?
[19376.38s -> 19466.46s]  There. Okay. Sorry. It wasn't. Oh my God. This game. Let me out of here. Okay. So what? Me, me.
[19466.54s -> 19492.02s]  Are you sure this is like a bomb or something? How do I get that to move?
[19493.62s -> 19519.86s]  I can't select it or I can't do anything with it. Magnetism doesn't do anything.
[19519.86s -> 19536.74s]  Stasis doesn't do anything. Whatever it is. I keep forgetting I own these things. I really do.
[19537.62s -> 19577.10s]  Does that not do anything? That doesn't do it. Right here. Dude, I'm stumped. I don't get it.
[19577.18s -> 19598.38s]  What? What does it want me to do? What? What just happened? Wait, it turns the whole thing.
[19598.38s -> 19604.81s]  Wait a minute. Hold on. What? What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Turn it back around.
[19604.81s -> 19616.95s]  I'm so confused right now. I don't have any arrows. I don't want to shoot an ancient arrow.
[19616.95s -> 19629.72s]  What if I get arrows? This thing's an ancient arrow. It's worth a lot.
[19630.44s -> 19666.18s]  Okay. Well then, can I? There's nothing at the end of this. I'm dead. I'm dead. GG doubters. I
[19666.18s -> 19681.03s]  physically can't get over there again because I don't have any arrows. Are you kidding me?
[19681.03s -> 19711.74s]  That can't be right. That can't be right. It actually can't be. All right. Now what?
[19712.46s -> 19718.46s]  Open. I have to. Oh, oh, oh, oh my God. I didn't even know that was a keyhole, guys.
[19718.46s -> 19730.46s]  I didn't know that was a keyhole. I didn't know that was a keyhole. Oh my God. I didn't. I
[19730.46s -> 19736.46s]  honestly just did not. That was not a keyhole to me. Oh my goodness. You got to be kidding me.
[19737.58s -> 19745.22s]  Okay. I picked up so many keys in Resident Evil 4 that they just became like,
[19745.22s -> 19755.14s]  oh, whatever. You got a key. Who cares? I still don't know what to do. I jump from here over.
[19758.34s -> 19786.86s]  Okay. I have to jump over. Okay. All right. That's fun. DJ, congratulations doubters.
[19786.86s -> 19807.61s]  You definitely won. GG doubters. Because I still can't piece together what the hell I do here.
[19808.25s -> 19825.70s]  Why am I hitting the ceiling, by the way? I shouldn't be. It's not that simple, right?
[19830.26s -> 19839.74s]  Where am I going? Where's the goal? I actually don't know where the goal of this shrine is.
[19840.46s -> 19862.87s]  It's not up top, right? Oh my God. It's over there. What is the point of that fucking thing?
[19862.87s -> 19885.90s]  What is the point of that square? Why is that there? It doesn't even help me at all. I'm done
[19885.90s -> 19931.85s]  with this fucking place. It didn't work. It doesn't even help me though. I don't fucking
[19931.85s -> 19993.35s]  understand this. I don't get it. It only launches you so far. Oh, I don't get it. How do I go higher
[19993.35s -> 20027.45s]  up over the edge? Wait, does this move everything? Yeah, but I don't have any arrows. How am I
[20027.45s -> 20082.50s]  supposed to do this without arrows? Throw a bomb over there? Can I even reach it? Come on, man.
[20082.50s -> 20107.43s]  That's just like that's so particular. That's so particular. That's particular. That was a 7x
[20107.43s -> 20116.58s]  payout. You just made a doubter out of me. Yeah, but next time you're going to bet against me and
[20116.58s -> 20132.38s]  I'm going to win and you're going to feel just as bad. All right, let's go upgrade and then I'm
[20132.38s -> 20147.45s]  going to pull that sword out of the ground. Is there one of those little shrines in here? What's
[20147.45s -> 20180.94s]  going on? No, the arrow would have made it easier. You can't probably drop because the words if and
[20180.94s -> 20187.05s]  though were banned. No, they were banned for hours before the stream crashed.
[20192.87s -> 20201.50s]  I'm sorry. I think that's just so stupid. What a strict community. Oh, hey, I'm just I'm a new
[20201.50s -> 20211.53s]  viewer. Do you think that I could I'm trying to think of a sense of the Oh, this is this is the
[20211.53s -> 20220.07s]  game for the switch that I like band. Oh, what did I say? Oh, fuck this guy. If you go up there,
[20220.07s -> 20239.54s]  I think deleted what this guy sucks. It wasn't timing anybody out. All right. Where is this
[20239.54s -> 20264.15s]  thing? It's in here, isn't it? Timed out for saying if frame rate forest was the to go inside
[20264.15s -> 20279.99s]  of this thing was the entrance. And it's right here. So I need health twice. My voice sucks.
[20279.99s -> 20285.62s]  We should do a secret word of the day. If you say it, you get a 24 hour timeout.
[20287.14s -> 20297.30s]  OK. Well, I like you just you just win. Yeah. All right. So if you get timed out for saying this
[20297.30s -> 20305.72s]  word, then you know, you just win. You don't win anything. You just win. And everyone goes,
[20305.72s -> 20313.51s]  wow, you did it. All right. I got to think of a word that people are just going to spam
[20313.51s -> 20319.59s]  words and then get it immediately. And it has to be a word in the dictionary. It's not going to be
[20319.59s -> 20327.45s]  a made up word. So in the mod chat, I'm going to type a word, put that on the list that times
[20327.45s -> 20336.26s]  you out, whatever. And whoever gets actually timed out for saying it wins the game. Who the
[20336.26s -> 20345.11s]  fuck is going to write this? No one's going to write that word. There's no way that's literally
[20345.11s -> 20386.70s]  not fucking going to happen. Tell me if somebody wins. Why would it be Peter Griffin? Wait,
[20386.70s -> 20405.99s]  we won't see it because it'll just get blocked. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I mean. Your chat is just
[20405.99s -> 20416.14s]  going to look like bots. I'll give you some hints because there's no you have to say every word in
[20416.14s -> 20438.76s]  the dictionary. I gave you a hint. The hint is, oh, it's not enabled yet. In the meantime,
[20438.76s -> 20494.47s]  I'm ready to pull this out. Your master will come for you until then. You shall rest safely here.
[20496.74s -> 20501.78s]  Although the slumber of restoration will most certainly deprive him of his memories.
[20502.90s -> 20508.42s]  Please trust me when I say that I know he will arrive before you yet again.
[20510.92s -> 20517.00s]  If I may be so bold, what is it that you are planning to do next, Princess?
[20517.96s -> 20528.12s]  Does thing talk? Oh, no, it doesn't. The Master Sword. I heard it speak to me.
[20529.66s -> 20534.38s]  It seems that my role is unfinished. There is still something I must do.
[20536.33s -> 20540.17s]  I sense there is great strength in your dedication.
[20540.73s -> 20548.25s]  I ask of you when he returns. Can you please relay this message?
[20549.61s -> 20556.65s]  Tell him I know the word as there was no word words intended for him. What sound much better
[20556.65s -> 20571.62s]  in the tones of your than if it was a word. Don't you think? Yes. All right. Here's the hint.
[20573.96s -> 20616.55s]  Steam. Steam. Nobody got it. Yes. Steam. Hot. Forceful. Magnificent. Somebody got it. Somebody
[20616.55s -> 20622.86s]  got it. Somebody got it. Somebody got it. Who got it? Somebody got it. It was Geyser. Nice job.
[20622.86s -> 20633.26s]  What you just saw, you stabbed years ago. It was Joshi. Hey, Joshi. Congratulations, Joshi.
[20634.22s -> 20641.78s]  Princess thought to bring it here where she knew that it would be safe under my watch.
[20643.82s -> 20649.90s]  She continues to fight. That's a dumbass word for real. It's a hard one. You never would have
[20649.90s -> 20661.85s]  guessed that. Heart cascades with faith that you will return. She has a smile like the sun.
[20663.05s -> 20673.05s]  I will do much to feel its warmth upon me once again. Want to do another one? Okay, let's do
[20673.05s -> 20713.62s]  another one. Okay, I got another one. This thing only does 30 damage. Okay, so don't use it till
[20713.62s -> 20737.72s]  the end of the game. All right. I did this stupid thing. How do I make it so I don't throw it?
[20737.72s -> 20745.67s]  It doesn't break. Oh, it doesn't break. You can throw it. Really? Whoa.
[20750.46s -> 20759.69s]  Oh, it does that at full health, right? That's really cool. Okay. The game is on. There's a new
[20759.69s -> 20785.22s]  word. Good luck. I'll give you a good hint. The hint is food. Food. It's delicious. Hot. Steam.
[20786.22s -> 20802.63s]  Forceful. Steam. Hot. You could even call it geyser-like. Somebody got it, Fajito.
[20802.63s -> 20821.18s]  Nice job. That was by Daisy. Nice job, Daisy. You're now ready to test the limits of your
[20821.18s -> 20829.86s]  courage at the place where you reunited with the Master Sword. You're gonna wait till I leave to
[20829.86s -> 20859.06s]  tell me this. Very cool. So this thing never breaks. That's DLC. Okay. Well, I'll do it maybe
[20859.06s -> 20882.34s]  another time. All right, we'll do one more word. I'm gonna give to the mods. It runs out of charge
[20882.34s -> 20904.92s]  and you can't use it for 30 minutes. Okay, that's good to know. Okay, a new word. A hint for this
[20904.92s -> 20937.35s]  one. How do I do a hint for this one, though, given in a way? Forceful. That's true. I wonder
[20937.35s -> 20943.22s]  if somebody gets it without me even saying it. Wait, somebody already got it? Somebody got it.
[20943.22s -> 20958.28s]  Who got it? I didn't even say anything. A lot of you guys are getting fucking timed out.
[20958.28s -> 20973.91s]  Somebody get it? What was the word? Wait, I need to get it confirmed. Did anybody get it?
[20975.58s -> 20993.67s]  Oh, okay. Fast. Blade. Blade.
[21010.81s -> 21027.27s]  That's pretty much all I can say to you. Fast. Blade. Spin. Spin. Spin.
[21028.39s -> 21049.37s]  Nice. Everybody got it. That was EV sprinkle helicopter. This next one is a phrase. Oh my god,
[21049.37s -> 21063.80s]  I'm driving the horse off into the water. This next one's gonna be a phrase. This is four words.
[21083.43s -> 21105.27s]  It's four words. It has to do with what you are seeing right now. Somebody already won it? All
[21105.27s -> 21108.07s]  right. Well, I don't know what the hell I did here, but I'm gonna have to call the horse at
[21108.07s -> 21126.44s]  a different stable. Just go back to this. Just get it. Go back and get it. No one got it yet?
[21126.44s -> 21159.80s]  All right. Here's the hint. Well, okay. All right. You got it, but you haven't said the right exact
[21159.80s -> 21176.14s]  phrase yet. It's all right. I'll do it. The stream is over. It's the end of the stream.
[21176.14s -> 21193.03s]  Oh, somebody got it. Gabe bud. But it's not quite over. Not yet. Give me another few minutes.
[21193.75s -> 21211.29s]  I want to get up to the next town. A right. What was the phrase? The phrase was the stream is over.
[21212.25s -> 21231.78s]  I'm ending the stream in about 10 minutes. 15 minutes. So, I've got one more divine beast and
[21231.78s -> 21238.07s]  then calamity Ganon, right? And then a bunch of side content, obviously.
[21240.97s -> 21263.11s]  That was fun. You're gonna do more side quests? Yeah. Oh, yeah. How did I turn around? I'm so
[21263.11s -> 21274.41s]  confused. How did I turn around in a circle? Let's do the secret word game next time.
[21275.21s -> 21312.97s]  I gotta think of some good twist for it. Okay. What is this? Or a tower. I'll get a tower in the
[21312.97s -> 21356.79s]  end. I don't see a tower anywhere. Kind of weird to be all the way out here and not have a single
[21356.79s -> 21398.52s]  tower or anything. There's one over there. Oh, I'll get this one.
[21405.88s -> 21417.34s]  Sing, please. My whole family is here. Your whole family is in the room. Like even like
[21417.34s -> 21421.90s]  grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, your whole family's in the room.
[21422.38s -> 21436.82s]  Yeah. All right. Yeah. Of course. I'll sing to your whole family. Hey, everybody. Welcome to
[21436.82s -> 21443.38s]  the stream. See, right now, you just fucking panicked and stumbled around desperately trying
[21443.38s -> 21447.70s]  to grab the remote to turn me down. Because you're like, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's so
[21447.70s -> 21451.30s]  embarrassing that you just had to show that to your whole family. Don't ever ask me for anything
[21451.30s -> 21472.55s]  like that again. You watch the sky. It was annoying. I fucking hated that.
[21475.34s -> 21488.31s]  Look at grandma. You pissed off grandma. Oh, that's probably easier to get.
[21517.10s -> 21564.82s]  It's been a wacky day today. Oh, you actually got me.
[21589.18s -> 21596.28s]  What the hell is happening? Why is there more than one? Oh, just because there's a tree.
[21596.92s -> 21600.07s]  Just because there's a tree. What happened to the horse?
[21609.61s -> 21622.58s]  Seriously, how do I revive the horse? No, I didn't, dude. He's fine. How do I revive the horse?
[21629.37s -> 21653.96s]  God damn it. Will you leave me alone with this? Do a fairy revive? Do I have one of those?
[21653.96s -> 21706.01s]  There is a way to revive. OK, thank God. Oh, no. Carry the laser, you'll be fine.
[21788.28s -> 21794.04s]  Will the next stream be chill? Yes. I feel like there's too many goofy things happening today
[21794.04s -> 21819.56s]  for it to be a proper chill stream. Too many goofy things happened. There we are. OK.
[21824.84s -> 21830.12s]  Yeah, Grotto Beast, it should be shipping really soon here. I've seen people talking about it out
[21830.12s -> 21837.88s]  there. Keep an eye on your tracking if you have one. We're incredibly excited to see
[21837.88s -> 21844.33s]  what people have to say. Yeah, we'll do a real chill stream. I'm going to slow it down a little
[21844.33s -> 21849.08s]  bit next time. I don't know. There was something in the water tonight. I was just all over the
[21849.08s -> 21858.52s]  place. It was fun, though. It was really fun. I will revive Frank 2. The next time you see me
[21858.52s -> 21864.86s]  stream, I'm going to play this again. I'm going to try to beat Breath of the Wild over the next
[21864.86s -> 21884.09s]  few days. So I will see you all on Monday. Monday at 6 p.m. Happy April Fools. I didn't really do
[21884.09s -> 21890.81s]  very much besides make it so you can't talk that much, which, oops. No, it was fun. I had a good
[21890.81s -> 21899.99s]  time. Hopefully it was fun to watch because it's fun to play. Good or as bad as I am at the game,
[21899.99s -> 21911.62s]  that's fine. We will slow it down. I will. We'll chill out next stream, but that's going to be it.
[21911.62s -> 21925.26s]  See you guys on Monday. Take care of yourselves. And also, Sea Dog had a massive raid. If you're
[21925.26s -> 21942.12s]  still here from Connor's stream. Yeah, we'll do some proper exploring. I'm not just going to run
[21942.12s -> 21949.88s]  to the next Divine Beast. There's a whole area that I want to go take a look at. So we're not
[21949.88s -> 21957.96s]  just going to sprint through the game. I'm thinking I'll try to get it done in the next
[21957.96s -> 21963.72s]  two or three streams. Maybe another two or three streams of this will probably do it.
[21963.72s -> 21977.00s]  Like another 15 hours or so. That's probably seems like accurate amount of time. We'll see.
[21977.00s -> 21982.22s]  What about April 5th? Well, that was that's the Roblox birthday party.
[21982.22s -> 22007.75s]  And take a pause on this for a little bit. Yeah. Have a great night. Have a good rest of your
[22007.75s -> 22019.51s]  weekend. I'm sorry. I was a little unhinged today, but I had fun. I still can't believe
[22019.51s -> 22022.55s]  people could not write the for the first four hours of the stream.
[22025.32s -> 22032.31s]  How do you guys were super, super creative with though? I didn't even notice. I did not even
[22032.31s -> 22049.08s]  notice as there was a lot of th threes is that's why they were writing that. Everybody was writing
[22049.08s -> 22052.60s]  that. That's right. I was wondering for a second after the first like 20 minutes, it's like, oh,
[22052.60s -> 22056.92s]  that's a funny joke. I just never, we just never turned it off. I was like, why are people doing
[22056.92s -> 22079.35s]  like th three? Still like what's going on? Adapt and overcome. All right. I'll see you guys
[22079.35s -> 22089.82s]  a day after tomorrow. Tomorrow for some of you, but take care of yourselves. Call your mother.
[22089.82s -> 22096.52s]  Thanks for watching. It's a good time to stop to midnight. I don't want to go too much longer.
[22101.26s -> 22104.82s]  More breath of the wild. Good night.
