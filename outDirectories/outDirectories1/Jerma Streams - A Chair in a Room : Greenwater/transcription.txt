[1.21s -> 7.66s]  All right, I'm just setting up the other game and wiping the lenses.
[15.94s -> 21.59s]  Cool. All right, this is called a chair in a room green water. I guess there's a chair in a room and
[21.59s -> 33.61s]  you have to investigate it. We'll see. There's more stuff in the exorcist game? Oh, oh well,
[35.74s -> 51.37s]  uh, maybe it's too late. All right, coming back. Here it is. Do the thing. Oh wait, hold on. I'm
[51.37s -> 61.48s]  gonna make sure I can see what you guys are saying. We're good. Draw two. All right. No,
[62.34s -> 71.77s]  relax. Here we go. This is called a chair. Okay, at some point this fell out again. I'm not even
[71.77s -> 78.76s]  gonna use it. I don't even care. That's like the nose guard. The camera looks weird too, doesn't
[78.76s -> 91.03s]  it? Don't you think? What's going on here? Hold on. It looks fucking crazy. The white balance is
[91.03s -> 108.10s]  wrong. There's a contrast. It's like all fucked up. Why does it look so fucking weird? I feel
[108.10s -> 114.47s]  like I'm, I feel like I'm stop motion. Like I'm 12, I'm like 21 frames a second or something. It's
[114.47s -> 129.14s]  weird. Don't you feel like I'm like, I've been animated? What happened? This is not at 60 fps.
[129.70s -> 141.69s]  Whatever. Don't worry. It's, it's, it's a chair in the room. Let's go. Would you have a 30 hertz
[141.69s -> 148.60s]  monitor? I don't have a 30 hertz monitor. I have a 120 hertz monitor. I need to upgrade. I have
[148.60s -> 154.84s]  1080 at 120 hertz. Intel, uh, six core processor. Don't worry. I'm gonna get one of those AMD
[154.84s -> 173.43s]  Rippers. I'm going back in. See you guys in a little bit. It's massive. Thanks, man.

[192.17s -> 227.64s]  room. Oh, Dr. Green? I judge how good a VR game is based on what is breakable in the room. And
[227.64s -> 252.84s]  there we go. Ladies and gentlemen, this is at least one letter grade. How do you do it? E,

[353.85s -> 364.55s]  Who's in that room? Ah, probably me in that chair. I don't know.
[367.69s -> 379.66s]  I was a bad Tommy Wiseau. I can't hear. My ears are blocked. If I could hear myself, I would do a
[379.66s -> 391.61s]  sick Tommy Wiseau impression. It was better than the last one. What do you mean credits? What are
[391.61s -> 441.83s]  you talking about? Hey, fuck you, bitch. I lost the chair part of the room. Oh, swan.

[581.70s -> 589.75s]  to do? Hide the cup, hide the ball under a cup? Sure. Good luck with this one, you piece of shit.

[881.56s -> 888.63s]  Oh, my eyes are all blurry. I don't know you like. Do you have like an antihistamine I can take?
[888.63s -> 891.35s]  I'll take that. But I don't want to take whatever weird drug you just gave me.
[894.84s -> 909.74s]  Uh, I need some other drug. All right. Fine. Where is it? I can hear. Where is it? Okay. All
[909.74s -> 923.10s]  right. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it. You can go back to your room now. Do I eat the

[1003.21s -> 1009.59s]  Are you ready for your point to start? I want to start a new game. Make your way upstairs.
[1010.47s -> 1028.52s]  Afters? I want to start a new game. I don't know. Maybe it'll just work. Will it just happen?
[1036.15s -> 1045.00s]  This is fucked up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to do that.
[1046.52s -> 1062.94s]  Walk into a wall. What happened? Why can I not start what I left off? There's got to be a way
[1062.94s -> 1070.58s]  to do that. It's got to be like a load game or something, right? Load game, load game,
[1070.58s -> 1079.67s]  but not start a new game. What does that one do? Aim. Please be comfortable. This room contains
[1079.67s -> 1082.23s]  all of the information you need to get ready for your point to be dropped to green. Oh, wait.
[1082.23s -> 1125.08s]  Let's photograph. Ready to start upstairs. Photograph and then grab the handle. Point?
[1127.62s -> 1151.78s]  There is only grip. What do you mean, point? Okay. This looks more like what was supposed
[1151.78s -> 1176.39s]  to happen, I guess. For my toys. What does this say? I need to go to my desk.
[1177.51s -> 1201.61s]  The Winter. Oscar Charrington. The Holy Bible. By Oscar Charrington. No, we're going to hotel,

[1216.84s -> 1232.44s]  Sleep? Ah, dude, another classic by fucking Oscar Charrington. Paradise Lost. A poem written in
[1232.60s -> 1259.27s]  10 books. Oscar Charrington. What time does that say? That is 1202. I am a murderer. Who did I kill?
[1261.37s -> 1271.38s]  What? I'm a murderer. Who did I kill? I am a murderer. Who did I kill? I remember a bird on
[1271.38s -> 1280.42s]  the water. What was that? Place the clue here. I wonder. Bird on the water. That sounds to me
[1280.42s -> 1298.94s]  like a duck. This is everything I can remember. I have to hide what I know. The doctors say that
[1298.94s -> 1303.74s]  memories haunt me so I hide this from them. Things here seem familiar, they must be. Right there.
[1304.70s -> 1315.05s]  Well. Oh, that's, this is, this is, that's a vulture.
[1317.96s -> 1321.56s]  Yeah, that's some good, that's some good shit, apparently.
[1323.40s -> 1343.16s]  Carry items between rooms. That was chapter one already. Chapter two, let's go. Oh, it's just,

[1355.85s -> 1380.44s]  What? I can't make that wrap. That's a huge alligator, by the way. Let's be real.
[1397.70s -> 1405.74s]  Power lamp. What's a power lamp? Operate, hold flashlight in hand and press thumb pad.
[1405.74s -> 1425.78s]  Oh, can I fish? Power lamp. Oh, press, there we go.
[1426.66s -> 1455.93s]  Well, that's not safe. I think so, boy. Okay, um, now what? I think I might have needed that.
[1456.73s -> 1474.14s]  Nice. Now, all right, what do I do? Check all the draws?
[1481.69s -> 1497.22s]  Add debt but still want the dream lifestyle you deserve? Unlock your, unlock your potential
[1497.22s -> 1529.05s]  mortgage refinance. No application. Live the dream. Oh, there's a, there's a, there's a monster
[1529.05s -> 1544.92s]  in there. There's a fucking monster. Did you see that? That's horrible. I swear to God,
[1544.92s -> 1559.32s]  there was a monster in there. Something in this. Can I like, screw drive his eye out?

[1620.73s -> 1635.78s]  That's what I saw. Where? Okay, uh, take these planks off.
[1642.34s -> 1660.70s]  All right, I need the light. This. Indeed. Indeed, say. Party's welcome. Regeneration.
[1660.70s -> 1675.62s]  The locals feel abandoned. What else is in there? Why? Just didn't feel like having anything in there.
[1676.82s -> 1728.81s]  Oh, there's something in that bag. What the fuck is in this bag? What happened? Pizza box?
[1732.46s -> 1765.74s]  This is a huge pizza thing to break that with. Oh, off the walk. I get in here. I leave this room?
[1766.30s -> 1801.93s]  I can leave this room. Bounce. I bring this with me into the room? Like this. Can I open that?
[1801.93s -> 1860.54s]  Turn on the lamp. 8.7k Andy. That's great. What happened to the lamp? It looks like Otto. Um,
[1860.54s -> 1880.65s]  it's so stupid. Where's the lamp? Why does it fucking disappear? Where's the lamp?
[1881.67s -> 1896.18s]  Lamp find lamp. Search for the lamp. Where's the lamp? Where's the lamp? At the lamp?
[1896.18s -> 1912.25s]  Where is the fucking lamp? Tuck in the wall in the first room. Fuck, come on.
[1913.93s -> 1927.78s]  Well, now I'm stuck in the wall. Stuck in the wall in the first room.
[1928.50s -> 1941.77s]  What's going on? Am I going crazy or what?
[1958.38s -> 1973.29s]  I'm fucking mad at this game now. Now I'm angry. Now you pissed me off. Now you made me angry. Now
[1973.29s -> 1979.58s]  you got me irritated. I'm searching around for a fucking lamp and I'm stuck in the wall now.
[1979.58s -> 2003.78s]  I don't think it's even here anymore. Just turn it off. Just turn it off. What button did I press
[2003.78s -> 2013.93s]  on the side? Why does this button exist by the way? Why would you put this button here? The button
[2013.93s -> 2028.15s]  that you like never find again. It's gone. I have to restart the whole thing. Am I losing my fucking
[2028.15s -> 2048.42s]  mind or is it just gone? Did I like throw it over here? Do I like, do I even need it? I'm giving
[2048.42s -> 2066.09s]  this 30 more seconds before I just delete it and uninstall again. Hey, so you're saying it's in this
[2066.09s -> 2088.71s]  room? Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's in here? I'm ready for my medicine. Can I take it please?
[2089.43s -> 2120.34s]  Light illuminating the wall. I think you're in the corner. It's really hard to see.
[2121.38s -> 2146.15s]  Here. You're talking about like in here. What happened? Give me his back. I thought that was
[2146.15s -> 2151.19s]  an eyeball. All right. All right. All right. Okay. All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.
[2155.02s -> 2171.38s]  Wait, can I go? What might be in this corner? Is it because I like the ruin? I like the ruin,
[2171.38s -> 2174.34s]  right? I was like, oh, there it goes. And then it got like lodged in the wall.
[2176.09s -> 2219.61s]  In this wall, technically, right? Shut up and let me in. End of the circle. Detail of the game.
[2221.50s -> 2227.11s]  Hey dude, it started up. It was so promising when it started out though.
[2236.41s -> 2248.41s]  I'm not, I'm never letting go of this. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Go. Go.
[2248.41s -> 2253.66s]  Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. That falls. It'll fall down in two seconds. Ready? Three, two, one. There it goes.
[2254.22s -> 2261.43s]  It falls down. I take a look over here. You read the postcard. Isn't that interesting?
[2262.15s -> 2270.42s]  Isn't that interesting? Okay. Isn't that interesting? Okay. Wow. Isn't that interesting?
[2270.42s -> 2276.25s]  Look at this. That's interesting. All interesting stuff. What's in here? Isn't that interesting?
[2276.25s -> 2281.45s]  What's this thing say? Holy shit. What's that say? Isn't that interesting? Okay. Cool. Cool. All right.
[2281.45s -> 2306.47s]  Drop. Drop that. There it goes. Okay. Drop. I thought that was outside of my window.
[2308.47s -> 2324.65s]  Oh, it was. I think somebody's just out there. Okay. Oh. There. I can't stop moving. Why am I moving?
[2325.37s -> 2334.86s]  Okay. Who cares? Open the door. What's in there? There's a scary monster. Open.
[2334.86s -> 2356.39s]  Open. Okay. Here we go. Hey. Remember that song? That thing moves. Three, two, one. Scary.
[2358.39s -> 2368.94s]  And this don't open. What do we do about that? Can I use the saw on that? Oh, dude. Oh, shit.
[2369.99s -> 2374.55s]  Man, what the heck? How do I get out of this? We open up this and see what's in here.
[2375.51s -> 2384.57s]  Oh, this means something maybe. Oh, authorities say that the plant got shut down. What the fuck,
[2384.57s -> 2388.49s]  dude? What the hell's going on in this town? What else is in here? That broke off.
[2389.53s -> 2405.14s]  Heck. Oh, something's moving in that bag. There. Who's in that? Oh. Beware. Beware. I didn't even
[2405.14s -> 2421.19s]  see that. I didn't have the lamp. Let's go. All right. What do I do with this?
[2421.75s -> 2431.54s]  Pry this off. What should I do with this? Pry the boards off. Okay. Here we go.
[2432.34s -> 2457.54s]  Pry those boards off. Let's work with the floor. There it is. And I can't grab it. I can't grab it.
[2457.54s -> 2481.08s]  Get in there. Come on. Get in there. Get out. Okay. It's blown. A couple of bones.
[2485.82s -> 2494.76s]  Otto, I'm not playing right now. He's like, I'm down here and he's like trying to play with me.
[2495.16s -> 2504.94s]  Otto. Hold on. All right. Wait. Hold on. I don't want to step on him. Give me one second.
[2505.50s -> 2531.38s]  You want to go out? Come here. Okay. I have to give this like five to 10 more minutes.
[2531.38s -> 2547.10s]  My back is going to explode. Getting kicked out of the room. Like every time I go this way,
[2547.10s -> 2560.34s]  it's like... Okay, here we go. Back to that like hospital. Nothing in there. I have probably
[2560.34s -> 2571.16s]  to go fishing. I'm going to say like go fishing. Right? Like that's a fishing pole.
[2572.02s -> 2577.38s]  Otto, we're going to scoop it out with this. Don't delete the... I left it way up there.
[2577.38s -> 2634.87s]  I need to get that fishing rod. There it goes. Oh. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What is it?
[2634.87s -> 2658.12s]  There's a key in here. Key. Oh my god. Yes. All right. We're good. All right. 10 more minutes.
[2658.12s -> 2663.99s]  10 more minutes. I promise, mom. I'll do my homework in 10 minutes.
[2664.15s -> 2673.59s]  All right. The game just got way better. I was very mean to this game. It just got way better.
[2673.59s -> 2675.83s]  We're going to get a residency before it by that crocodile.
[2695.56s -> 2719.24s]  There she blows. Where is it? I lie down on my back. It can't get me.
[2720.66s -> 2729.75s]  Wait, do I have to steer this? I thought that was just the motor.
[2744.46s -> 2758.97s]  Oh, it's a big swan. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[2759.93s -> 2802.82s]  Hey. Well, I'm going to sit down and enjoy myself. Am I supposed to be doing something?
[2804.10s -> 2852.20s]  What's that? Look, those are birds over there flying around. What's happening? Did I miss something?
[2864.33s -> 2885.56s]  Mommy, I saw something in the water. No. No. Don't even think about it. Get out of here.
[2887.54s -> 2920.34s]  Watch that tail. He's going to smash underneath us. Hey, don't do that. What a trip, Hank.
[2921.22s -> 2931.86s]  Let's go out. It's a little foggy. Don't worry about it. Okay. I'm cold. It's foggy.
[2932.50s -> 2942.41s]  We can't see anything. You want to fish out here? God darn it. Worst trip I've ever taken. Hank,
[2942.41s -> 2976.73s]  what's that? POV. You're on a murder date. Wait for the drop. It's right there.
[2991.67s -> 3016.55s]  Was that Seaman? That was Seaman. What was that? Seaman 2. I'll be honest. That was a very,
[3016.55s -> 3025.30s]  very, very, very, very, very long boat ride. The allocator did not fucking knock it over.
[3025.78s -> 3032.25s]  You know what I mean? He did get a Seaman reveal, though, which was pretty awesome.
[3034.74s -> 3054.87s]  Okay. Let's go to bed now, right? Go to bed. I want to do more in the medical place,
[3054.87s -> 3062.15s]  but she's telling me to do things. That was so cool. A teenager in the water. Who else was out
[3062.15s -> 3073.62s]  there? What was that bird in the highway? Bird on the highway. Highway bird. No, not a highway bird.
[3074.26s -> 3086.49s]  Highway bird. That kind of looks like a highway bird. No, that's not a highway bird. This is a
[3086.49s -> 3110.07s]  highway bird. We're in a motel. This might get interesting. That boat ride with that leg. Here
[3110.07s -> 3117.43s]  it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.
[3117.43s -> 3124.17s]  Here it comes. This face in the water. All right. This is getting a little creepy.
[3127.21s -> 3130.65s]  All right. This is already way scarier than riding on the Disney boat.
[3131.37s -> 3139.05s]  Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Stop. Stop. Stop. I don't want to do that.
[3141.82s -> 3148.06s]  Look, I get it. You're trying to watch the porn channel. It's not going to come through. I tried
[3148.06s -> 3185.32s]  everything already. I'm sorry. I remember what? Meet me tomorrow morning? I think the mic just
[3185.32s -> 3216.94s]  picked up her just ripping a huge one. I remember George. Meet her tomorrow morning. Oh, this is
[3217.02s -> 3226.50s]  crazy. Why would you just be taking pills at the bottom of the ocean?
[3229.61s -> 3264.50s]  Oh, this is creepy. What kind of bed is this? A weird bed? It's not long enough. What's weird
[3264.50s -> 3300.17s]  about this? Why? It's like a big marshmallow bed. Morning yet? Where the hell am I?
[3301.40s -> 3308.65s]  Like in Motel, no fake. Where am I? Like the dream reality is like shifting around.
[3312.26s -> 3334.58s]  King size beds. Can I open this? Can I open this? Uh, pills in here. Oh, take the pills.
[3334.58s -> 3356.26s]  Take them. All right. I took more of them. Oh, that's, I hate that.
[3357.14s -> 3382.73s]  Okay, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap. Oh, it's the duck. It's the duck.
[3384.22s -> 3401.00s]  It's the scariest fucking monster we've seen all night. Oh, shit. Okay. Go out, out, out, out,
[3401.00s -> 3405.48s]  out of the room. Out of the room. Out of the room. We can go, we can leave, right? We can get the
[3405.48s -> 3429.06s]  fuck out of here, right? He's going to be in my face. I thought it was really going to be this
[3429.14s -> 3446.15s]  one, like chasing us. I feel really fucked up. I'm going to be really honest with you.
[3446.71s -> 3456.71s]  This is what it feels like when you're shit faced. I, this is, this is, who made this game?
[3457.93s -> 3461.85s]  You've got to give this to like people to like, to like, this is like an education. This is
[3461.85s -> 3476.70s]  educational. Like this is fucked up. All right, get out. This is, this is some, this is exactly
[3476.70s -> 3486.90s]  what it's like. You nailed it. You nailed it. God damn it. Another hallway. It's coming. Here
[3486.90s -> 3510.07s]  comes the swan again. I'm going to turn around. I'm going to see a swan behind me. Oh, I'm out
[3510.07s -> 3558.09s]  of bounds. Okay. Oh shit. There's drugs in there. I think. I don't know.
[3577.40s -> 3582.76s]  But a police spokesperson has confirmed that the victim suffered multiple injuries and it is still
[3582.76s -> 3587.16s]  unclear if the victim drowned in the swamp or if he was killed before entering the water.
[3589.10s -> 3594.94s]  Okay. Police are investigating an unusual theme park swan boat, which was found close to the
[3594.94s -> 3600.06s]  victim's body. I think it might've been the killer. Information about a figure seen using the boat in
[3600.06s -> 3604.94s]  the early hours. Swan boat was seen fleeing the crime scene on the surveillance video of the
[3604.94s -> 3615.40s]  amusement park. Bring some booze with those pills.
[3645.56s -> 3681.30s]  That's scary. Oh shit. Oh, uh, mommy and daddy are on a vacation right now.
[3686.25s -> 3689.82s]  Fuck. Who are you? Was that me in the, was that me or them?
[3689.82s -> 3698.50s]  We're at the Pelican Motel now. We need to check out at the end of that road.
[3698.50s -> 3701.78s]  Now make sure that no one tries to slip away. Officer, I'm in here.
[3701.78s -> 3718.01s]  Officer. Officer. Officer. I'm in this room. Officer. I'll break this fucking thing if I have to.
[3724.49s -> 3729.86s]  Oh, he's talking, he's talking to me. Leave the room. This is dangerous.
[3739.82s -> 3771.24s]  Oh, safe. Road safe. Don't suffer alone. Code for the safe. What are you getting that from?
[3771.24s -> 3812.94s]  There might be a code in here. Ah, eight, four, five, six, seven, five. But I remember I've
[3812.94s -> 3901.75s]  write down. Oh, dough. I can't read it. Oh, seven, nine. Is that right? I really can't read it.
[3902.71s -> 3920.89s]  Six, two, seven. Is it six, two, seven, nine? Fucking do it. Six, two, seven, nine.
[3922.15s -> 3937.77s]  Wrong code. Officer, do you know what the, what the code is for all the safes?
[3938.49s -> 4024.26s]  What do you see? Key digits. Digits. Not four. Oh, that's easy. Postcard. Oh, postcard. Why is
[4024.26s -> 4057.90s]  it doing a creepy sound like? Ace of a safe shell. Oh, right. I heard it there. Greetings from New
[4057.90s -> 4098.74s]  Orleans. What's going on here? Bitch. Eight, four, three. Eight, four, three is the only three digit
[4098.74s -> 4113.11s]  number up here. Wait, why is the bathroom locked from the inside? I don't know. Eight, four, three.
[4113.99s -> 4118.07s]  Go to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom. I can't. It's locked from the inside.
[4118.79s -> 4149.29s]  Hear him? All right, I'm gonna do eight, four, three. God, give me a fucking break. Fork in, outlet.
[4152.65s -> 4161.78s]  Don't say that. Fork in, outlet. Where's that fork? All right, maybe can I break,
[4161.78s -> 4178.42s]  I can break the door open? Okay, it keeps, it's playing a sound. I'm looking for three digit codes,
[4178.42s -> 4215.42s]  like an asshole. Hugs. Always take them immediately. What does that do for me?
[4216.06s -> 4233.11s]  No writing on the bathroom wall or anything. Writing on this? Or pro-mav-zine? Or pro-ma-zine?
[4246.52s -> 4259.00s]  Three, two, three, two, eight. Three, two, zero. Let's go, buddy. I cannot leave.
[4259.00s -> 4267.82s]  Somebody in the bathtub. Somebody in the bathtub. Somebody in the bathtub. I knew there was a
[4267.82s -> 4298.54s]  little person there. Grade 20. Oh, give it to me. Is. Hey, I need the, what's the flashlight?
[4311.13s -> 4333.14s]  Puzzle, okay? I need the, I need the next piece. Bible. I'm gonna open that. Wait for me in the
[4333.14s -> 4360.63s]  lodge. Wait for me in the lodge. All right, I will. I have to look in the Bible. Wait for me in the
[4360.63s -> 4366.60s]  lodge. All right, let's go. Get that chair out of the way. The cops aren't there anymore.
[4374.30s -> 4405.06s]  Hide the page in the Bible. Actually, pretty brilliant. And wait for you in the lodge.
[4407.19s -> 4417.29s]  We know you're in there. Me? You better come out, buddy. Whatever doesn't kill you
[4418.33s -> 4428.06s]  makes you a stranger. Three. I thought I was gonna count to three. Wait, don't you come in on three?
[4429.18s -> 4467.35s]  The dead guy give me the Bible. Why the lodge? Why me? It was a bird. One who preys on the
[4467.35s -> 4471.74s]  weakness of others. Birds. All right, I'm gonna get this five more minutes.
[4475.72s -> 4486.09s]  Five more minutes. All right, that last chapter was actually really good.
[4486.89s -> 4503.26s]  That was very good. That was terrifying. That was very good. There are hints on your hand behind
[4503.26s -> 4523.24s]  that. Really? The eyes. The hips. Like a hip MRI. That is bird lungs.
[4529.40s -> 4549.78s]  Oh, that's a huge chair. That chair looks like it's made out of... This is like a human chair.
[4550.90s -> 4567.62s]  It looks like it's made out of blood. That's a normal chair. That's kind of... That's a weird
[4567.62s -> 4579.69s]  chair. That's weird. I don't like those. It's a weird chair, isn't it? It's a scary chair to me.
[4580.49s -> 4591.58s]  Literally a chair. I feel like if I was... I'd be scared of that chair. It looks like it's gonna
[4591.58s -> 4597.13s]  have knives shoot out of those little holes and like a shot through my back. Oh, what the
[4597.13s -> 4653.18s]  fuck? Are you kidding me, dude? Are you serious? Nice. Good. Oh. Like it. Don't like it. Oh.
[4653.18s -> 4686.60s]  Careful. There's a desk there. Excuse me. What are you doing? That's it. At least. When I just
[4686.60s -> 4694.31s]  bent... I guess not. I'm having like too much fun, but VR... I can't stream VR for more than five
[4694.31s -> 4715.10s]  hours, so I can't. All right. One minute. One more minute. VR is so much fun. It's just impossible
[4715.10s -> 4729.70s]  to do. I'm gonna take a bath. Don't worry. Get down here. Oh, nice degree.
[4730.50s -> 4750.71s]  Oh, look. It's so prestigious. Eastern Teaching Hospital. Wow. You're smarter than me because
[4750.71s -> 4815.70s]  you're a doctor. Oh, no. It's a face. Eyes. Moustache. Mouth. How did you get in here?
[4822.86s -> 4855.35s]  Where is he? What am I supposed to do? Are you gonna come down here?
[4855.99s -> 4867.86s]  Should I come down here and say something about it? That says something. I need a lamp.
[4870.23s -> 4886.23s]  That says something back there. It's written up there.
[4920.87s -> 4930.86s]  This was fun, but I gotta stop before I die. Postcard on the desk will pick up on it on
[4930.86s -> 4937.32s]  Halloween night. This is a lot of fun, though. All right. I'll give you my verdict. Chapter one
[4937.32s -> 4943.24s]  was awesome. Chapter two was not good at all. Chapter three was incredible. Chapter four,
[4943.24s -> 4949.80s]  we don't know yet. We don't know yet. Hey, I'll give you a hold on a minute for this one.
[4949.80s -> 4964.10s]  The Exorcist was awesome. That was really good. Really good. Dip five marshmallows in water and
[4964.10s -> 4978.07s]  then do what? What do you want me to do? Otto? Otto's gone. He wanted to go up. All right. Here's
[4978.07s -> 4985.64s]  the plan. Oh, thank you for joining me tonight. That was very, very fun. Very scary. I lost
[4985.64s -> 4989.40s]  probably a little bit of a little bit of time left in the end of my life because of all the screaming.
[4990.98s -> 4998.60s]  Exorcist was fucking crazy. Anyways, next stream is going to be Watch Dogs Legion. I'm going to
[4998.60s -> 5005.78s]  play it at lunch. I'm probably only going to play for one day, but I mean, I've been, it could,
[5005.78s -> 5010.98s]  there's potential that it could be at least fun to play for like four or five hours.
[5010.98s -> 5015.98s]  Is it sponsored? No. Trust me. Don't worry. I'll like swear about the game a thousand times.
[5015.98s -> 5019.14s]  Trust me. I'm probably going to tell you the game's terrible. I'll play the game for like
[5019.14s -> 5028.70s]  four hours and go, this game's fucking awful. I hate this. I don't know. No, it's not a sponsored
[5028.70s -> 5034.74s]  stream. It's not. I just want to look, I'll be honest. I want to play as the old lady and
[5034.74s -> 5039.37s]  strangle somebody and then this room will be over. I'm just going to have a team of old ladies.
[5039.37s -> 5043.21s]  Everybody that's on my team is going to be over the age of like 70 and we're just going to strangle
[5043.21s -> 5051.40s]  people and I'll do like four missions. I got what I wanted out of it. And then after that,
[5051.40s -> 5055.72s]  we're going to play Little Hope with Italics and Italics is going to do a co-op stream.
[5056.52s -> 5062.28s]  Last time me and Italics played, we did Man of Medan. So fast forward like a year and we're
[5062.28s -> 5067.96s]  going to do Little Hope now. And then Halloween night, we're going back in here and I'm going to
[5067.96s -> 5074.14s]  do more of this shit on Halloween night. It'll be fun. So you won't see me for the next two days
[5074.14s -> 5084.74s]  and then we'll go bang, bang, bang three days in a row. Are you Brad? Let's see. I am wiped out
[5084.74s -> 5090.55s]  though. I'm fucking tired. I'll, uh, I'll see you guys in a couple of days. I'm going to actually
[5090.55s -> 5097.29s]  crouch down here. It's a shit load of people here. I didn't even look at like the view count.
[5097.29s -> 5107.35s]  I thought you guys were just saying like 9k, 10k Andy again. Man, there's a, you back there. You
[5107.35s -> 5111.67s]  back there. I saw what you just did. You think you can hide that from me? I saw what you just did.
[5111.67s -> 5116.36s]  I think I can't fucking notice that. Well, now you're a 7k. Well, the stream's over. People
[5116.36s -> 5122.71s]  leaving. Uh, yeah, I'll see you guys a couple of days. Thanks for watching. Thanks for the subs.
[5122.71s -> 5129.22s]  We're going to show them right now. Here they come. Let's go over and see if any of the, anything
[5129.22s -> 5142.73s]  major, uh, sub or donation wise happened because I can't really see them. Take a look. I'm going
[5142.73s -> 5153.48s]  to wait here staring at the screen for two days. I think that might not be a great idea. That's
[5153.48s -> 5159.64s]  what I do. Uh, we had the 10 community subs from Princess Hotcakes and then five from Nidhogg
[5160.20s -> 5168.12s]  from Nidhogg Man. Thank you both of you. That rounds out the community subs for today.
[5170.57s -> 5184.98s]  No, I'm not streaming till Halloween. No, no, no. I'm streaming Watch Dogs Legion when it comes out.
[5184.98s -> 5190.02s]  Even just kneeling down like this. I put my knees on the ground and I'm just leaning forward.
[5190.02s -> 5203.13s]  I'm like about to break in half. Let me lean back for a sec. Oh, god damn it. What happened to me?
[5203.77s -> 5214.82s]  What actually happened? I have no idea. I'm still on it. I'm still punching at it. Grab a chair. No,
[5214.82s -> 5221.90s]  I'm okay. I'm okay. Otto didn't do anything wrong. No, he didn't. He's a good boy.
[5226.55s -> 5261.32s]  Raid Ross. Uh, sure. What's he doing? No, not Ross from Friends. What? Ross from Friends.
[5261.32s -> 5275.50s]  All right, we're gonna go say hi. We'll go, uh, go tell Ross hello. Rubber ninja. We played Fa-
[5275.50s -> 5280.30s]  you know, maybe we'll play Phasmophobia again soon. I mean, it's Halloween. Maybe we'll try
[5280.30s -> 5288.47s]  to get like a Halloween Phasmophobia thing again. That'd be cool. All right, go tell Ross I said
[5288.47s -> 5293.43s]  hello. They're playing Super Mario Maker 2. They're, uh, I believe he's making levels.
[5293.99s -> 5301.42s]  He's doing level fixing. Let's find out. I will see you guys in a couple of days. Have a great rest
[5301.42s -> 5308.73s]  of your night. Goodbye. Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking around as always. Take care. See you soon.
