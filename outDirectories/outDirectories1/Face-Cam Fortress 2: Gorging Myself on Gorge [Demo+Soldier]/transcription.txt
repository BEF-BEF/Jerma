[0.31s -> 17.02s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2, Facecam Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[17.02s -> 28.88s]  That's a lot of words. This is episode 1 of Facecam Fortress 2. Well, technically not episode 1, but it's episode probably like 4 or 5.
[29.88s -> 31.88s]  Heavy, you're gonna kill me and soldier behind me.
[31.88s -> 40.06s]  Episode 1 of probably 500,000. I'm gonna do this every Monday and every Saturday, and they'll be uploaded around the same time.
[40.06s -> 58.26s]  So expect a FCF2, Facecam Fortress 2, FCF2 video every Monday and Saturday at 1pm Eastern time. Standard. And that is, no, it's not a spy. Is it? No, it's not.
[58.26s -> 66.50s]  This is the Demoman with the default. Pretty much everything except for the halfs of Toichi. And this is on gorge. Let's gorge ourselves on gorge.
[66.50s -> 79.26s]  I thought that was a spy. I wasted it. Somebody come up there. Anybody? Anybody? Ooh, Heavy. Please don't kill me, Heavy. Don't come up the stairs. I don't want to die.
[81.02s -> 84.32s]  Heavy? Sniper.
[84.32s -> 89.62s]  My name is still Abrum. I didn't mean for that to be there, really.
[89.62s -> 96.38s]  I just got a couple of good kills. And...
[96.38s -> 102.38s]  Oh my god, I killed him. Oh my god, he was just standing in the corner.
[102.38s -> 106.99s]  Maybe this Heavy will not know I'm behind him. Or this Batic.
[106.99s -> 109.99s]  Oh my god, that was so unfair.
[109.99s -> 118.05s]  Oh my god. Does that guy have a bootlegger?
[118.05s -> 137.81s]  I need a Medic. Do we have any? No, we don't. We don't have one Medic. Maybe I'll change that after... Oh no.
[137.81s -> 143.11s]  Thank you Pyro for saving my life. It doesn't matter though, I'm going to die right here anyways.
[143.11s -> 149.11s]  I forgot to mention this because I was screwing this on before the video started. Well, not that I forgot to mention it, but...
[149.11s -> 152.11s]  You want to see the vitamins that I take? This is actually pretty funny.
[152.11s -> 157.11s]  So, Centrum Silver. I don't know if the camera is going to go out of focus, but Centrum Silvers.
[157.11s -> 165.79s]  Take a look at the age. 50 plus. I got to take 50 year old vitamins. Well, 50 plus.
[165.79s -> 170.79s]  And that's because of my Crohn's disease. I got to take old people vitamins.
[170.79s -> 174.10s]  For Grandma. Grandpa should be taking those, not me.
[174.10s -> 182.62s]  But it's because old people don't have as good absorption of nutrients into their intestines, I think it is.
[182.62s -> 188.92s]  And my intestines are a little bit on the slow side, because of course I have Crohn's.
[188.92s -> 193.42s]  But yeah, I thought that was funny. My mother showed those to me. She's like, these are the vitamins you got to take.
[193.42s -> 212.26s]  I was like, I do? That's a three piece. Oh, bump into that. How did I crit him? Oh, someone's behind me.
[213.26s -> 221.24s]  Or are they?
[222.24s -> 226.86s]  Soldier with direct hits scares me a little. Nah.
[226.86s -> 231.74s]  I had a feeling he was going to kill me. I had a feeling.
[231.74s -> 233.74s]  You know what? Where are my cough drops? I want one right now.
[233.74s -> 241.18s]  Ricola. Do I have enough time? I got plenty of time.
[241.18s -> 248.62s]  Oh, I got plenty of spies. Timing up and backstabbing scumbags like you. No offense.
[248.62s -> 254.67s]  If you manage to kill them, I assure you, they will not like spies.
[254.67s -> 260.56s]  Who the hell am I doing? I think we're going to win. They're not even at the first point.
[260.56s -> 267.26s]  Oh, he's going to charge shot me. Actually, you know why I said that?
[267.26s -> 273.26s]  I've been watching a lot of those YouTube poops of Team Fortress where they replace the sentences.
[273.26s -> 279.43s]  So like the scout will say something like this, like, oh, I kill plenty of birds, a diamond bird, birds, like you birds.
[279.43s -> 285.99s]  Like, I can't really replicate it, but it's very, very funny.
[285.99s -> 288.42s]  We win. We're going to win.
[288.42s -> 296.10s]  I never know what to do with myself after I die. I come just like, I could just sit here.
[296.10s -> 299.73s]  I could model. There's a fly right in front of here.
[299.73s -> 308.06s]  Do you guys see that? Fly bastard. Hope he lands right in my mouth.
[308.06s -> 322.87s]  I do not hope that. Gotta get on the point. Slow walk to the first point in Gorge.
[322.87s -> 330.45s]  Oh, come on. Smash. Smash. Come on. Get him off.
[330.45s -> 347.63s]  What the hell? Who is this soldier? There we go. Anybody else? Here we go. Cool.
[347.63s -> 356.62s]  Alrighty. Alrighty then. Let's do another one. He's not a threat.
[356.62s -> 361.92s]  How did I not kill that guy? How did I still not kill that guy? Oh my God.
[361.92s -> 368.19s]  All right. I made up for it because I smashed that guy in his teeth.
[368.19s -> 380.30s]  I can't believe I didn't kill that guy. Crit rocket. Medic? That's a spy probably.
[380.30s -> 385.94s]  I guess not. The way he jerked away. I could have sworn he was a spy.
[385.94s -> 402.24s]  Buff banner. Crush him baby. Smash. Somebody kill him. Somebody kill that guy.
[402.24s -> 414.59s]  Pop. Doctor, I require assistance. And that is going to be a cap right there.
[414.59s -> 418.97s]  I don't even want to be a part of it. I want to be forward. Forward motion.
[418.97s -> 431.49s]  We got engineer and you. Oh, you are a slippery one. I can't go up there right now.
[431.49s -> 446.34s]  Where's that medic? Medic my friend, where did you go? It's okay. I'm good.
[446.34s -> 455.24s]  I'm good. I'm not even going to need the banner. Maybe we will.
[455.24s -> 463.09s]  There's going to be a lot of dudes down here. There we go. There we go.
[463.09s -> 472.14s]  All right guys. That's going to wrap it up for episode one of ten hundred million thousand face cam fortress 2.
[472.14s -> 475.56s]  So I'll see you guys all next time and take care everybody.
[475.56s -> 479.00s]  Otto! He's not even here.
