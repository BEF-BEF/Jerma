[0.31s -> 12.57s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some more Hitman Absolution.
[12.57s -> 19.57s]  This is the remaining footage I had before the holiday rush, which is why you haven't seen very much Hitman on this channel lately.
[19.57s -> 22.57s]  And I want to tell you what I'm planning on doing with this series.
[22.57s -> 28.81s]  To make this go a little faster and a little more smoothly, I'm going to livestream the rest of this game.
[28.81s -> 32.81s]  You will know there will be plenty of announcements. I'll put it on Twitter and on my Steam group, on YouTube.
[32.81s -> 34.81s]  There will be an announcement saying I'm streaming Hitman.
[34.81s -> 43.81s]  And what I'm going to do with that footage, the footage that I get from the livestream, is going to come over here in full unedited onto YouTube.
[43.81s -> 51.81s]  So you might see an episode of Hitman Absolution that is like an hour and 45 minutes long, but it will be like five or six missions in a row.
[51.81s -> 58.81s]  And I feel like that's a better way to do this, because a lot of you guys want to see episodes more frequently, and I feel like this is the best way to do it.
[58.81s -> 65.81s]  So rather than have you guys have to wait like four or five days for another 15 minute episode, I can throw up a super episode.
[65.81s -> 70.81s]  And then you guys can dictate when you want to watch it, how long you want to watch it, do you want to watch like 20 minutes of it here,
[70.81s -> 74.81s]  and then wait like till later tonight, later tomorrow, whatever, to watch the rest of it.
[74.81s -> 77.81s]  I can dictate that up to you guys. And there will be no ads during the middle of it.
[77.81s -> 79.81s]  There's just going to be one ad in the beginning and one ad in the end.
[79.81s -> 83.81s]  I'm not going to throw like 10 ads in the middle of the video, so don't worry about that.
[83.81s -> 87.81s]  I just feel like this is a better way for me to be able to get this series out to you guys quicker.
[87.81s -> 92.05s]  And as always, please let me know what you think in the comments section if you like this idea.
[92.05s -> 94.05s]  And I'm going to let the live commentary play out now.
[94.05s -> 101.05s]  This is, like I said, just the tail end of the last remaining footage I had before I decided to do this change.
[101.05s -> 105.05s]  So I'll see you guys all soon. Take care, everybody, and enjoy the show.
[105.05s -> 116.25s]  Are they going to run away or what? Go secure the top floor like you were just asked to.
[116.25s -> 133.58s]  Let's go out here and make it out of the crowd. Oh, I'm in the crowd, baby.
[133.58s -> 142.05s]  Stand still to hide in the crowd. All right. Use control to see the crowd that's hiding you.
[142.05s -> 149.00s]  Oh, it's this crowd. Okay. Let's keep going. Where's the exit over here?
[149.00s -> 158.18s]  Walk my way over through this crowd. I'm standing this one.
[158.18s -> 164.18s]  Police officer over there. I think I can make it to this one, maybe. That's going to be tough.
[164.18s -> 169.91s]  Hey, guys, how are you? We're all waiting for the train together. That's a fast train.
[169.91s -> 173.98s]  That thing just went 5,000 miles per hour over here.
[173.98s -> 191.54s]  Let me play the video game. That's good. There's a cop over there.
[191.54s -> 195.74s]  That's all right. And there's a cop over on that side.
[195.74s -> 213.69s]  Got to go up. How am I supposed to go up? I can go in here, but there's a cop in here.
[213.69s -> 224.50s]  Is something going to happen here? Is this guy going to come out?
[224.50s -> 232.55s]  What does that say? What does that say? I want to see what it says.
[232.55s -> 234.55s]  This might provide a safe access to the control room.
[234.55s -> 242.27s]  You tell me all these people aren't going to see me do this? That's kind of suspicious.
[242.27s -> 243.90s]  Holy...
[243.90s -> 245.65s]  Right.
[245.65s -> 251.60s]  I'll pass the window for one second here.
[251.60s -> 261.16s]  Get in. A ladder right there. Let's make it out.
[261.16s -> 275.82s]  Climb the ladder. Another checkpoint. Perfect.
[275.82s -> 289.04s]  Checkpoint. Got to activate this train. Let's do it. He's busy.
[289.04s -> 301.67s]  Objective complete. Go to platform B and wait for the next train. Let's do it, then.
[301.67s -> 306.38s]  Ooh, hold on, hold on, hold on. There's a dude right here.
[306.38s -> 314.22s]  Is he going to come in this room? Wow. No, he's just hanging out over there. I should be fine.
[314.22s -> 321.54s]  Don't want to go that way. Let's head back out the way I came in.
[321.54s -> 330.15s]  Keep off tracks. Electric current. You will die.
[330.15s -> 335.38s]  Nobody there. All right, I'm back.
[335.38s -> 339.38s]  Hi, people. Looks like blending in with the crowd.
[339.38s -> 342.14s]  Wait a minute. I got to go over on that side.
[342.14s -> 350.61s]  How do I get over there? Is there a way to get over there?
[350.61s -> 353.61s]  There has to be a way to get over there from over here, maybe. I don't know.
[353.61s -> 355.98s]  I probably should have stayed up there.
[355.98s -> 361.89s]  Let's just check over here first to make sure.
[361.89s -> 364.58s]  There's not a way to go over there.
[364.58s -> 370.08s]  I'm not seeing any points of interest.
[370.08s -> 376.26s]  I wonder if I can just walk by these officers.
[376.26s -> 378.26s]  It's going to be risky, but I can try it.
[378.26s -> 381.26s]  I got a checkpoint up there in case this goes wrong.
[381.26s -> 385.92s]  Let's go for it.
[385.92s -> 388.92s]  Hey, how are you, officer? There's another one right here, too.
[388.92s -> 392.78s]  Oh, boy. This ain't going to work.
[392.78s -> 395.78s]  Oh, this ain't going to work. Oh, this ain't going to work.
[395.78s -> 403.12s]  Wow.
[403.12s -> 409.03s]  I'm standing in the crowd.
[409.03s -> 412.36s]  One cop there. I don't have any instinct left.
[412.36s -> 414.36s]  This is going to be difficult.
[414.36s -> 418.97s]  That guy's not paying attention. Neither is this guy.
[418.97s -> 423.19s]  So let's keep moving.
[423.19s -> 426.19s]  I wonder if I can just play this game and this guy won't do anything.
[426.19s -> 429.01s]  Let's see.
[429.01s -> 431.01s]  Perfect. I'm covered in mud.
[431.01s -> 436.32s]  Get out of here, man.
[436.32s -> 440.35s]  All right, turn. Let's go.
[440.35s -> 445.18s]  Oh, this guy's coming back this way now.
[445.18s -> 448.86s]  This guy's coming back. This guy's coming back.
[448.86s -> 452.62s]  Made it.
[452.62s -> 457.22s]  Beautiful. Beautiful.
[457.22s -> 460.22s]  Platform B is under close surveillance. Timing is crucial.
[460.22s -> 467.49s]  Good to know. So where's that train?
[467.49s -> 471.01s]  Where is that freaking train?
[471.01s -> 477.26s]  Waiting for the train.
[477.26s -> 482.74s]  Do I have to go down there for the train to come?
[482.74s -> 486.18s]  Where's the train? Come on, train. Let's go.
[486.18s -> 492.94s]  I don't got all day.
[492.94s -> 496.08s]  I'm going to have to do it.
[496.08s -> 501.65s]  Right when these two turn.
[501.65s -> 503.65s]  When these two guys turn around, I'm going down there.
[503.65s -> 506.98s]  This is going to be really hard.
[506.98s -> 510.69s]  Holy crap.
[510.69s -> 513.63s]  Time to go.
[513.63s -> 519.33s]  Time to go. Time to go.
[519.33s -> 521.33s]  The train will arrive in 60 seconds.
[521.33s -> 525.23s]  60 seconds. I got to wait here.
[525.23s -> 527.23s]  Oh, this is going to be so hard.
[527.23s -> 529.73s]  This is going to be so hard.
[529.73s -> 533.95s]  Oh, man. Come on, train. Let's go.
[533.95s -> 538.30s]  45 seconds.
[538.30s -> 542.78s]  I'm going to make this a little bit more difficult.
[542.78s -> 547.52s]  I'm going to get in this crowd right here.
[547.52s -> 552.51s]  Come on. 30 seconds. Come on.
[552.51s -> 556.67s]  Come on, train.
[556.67s -> 562.05s]  Come on, train.
[562.05s -> 566.27s]  This is okay. This is okay.
[566.27s -> 568.96s]  Cops are nowhere to be found.
[568.96s -> 570.96s]  I can just chill out. Perfect.
[570.96s -> 575.04s]  15 seconds.
[575.04s -> 577.04s]  Start the countdown. Come on. Let's go, train.
[577.04s -> 582.91s]  Nope. Nobody coming.
[582.91s -> 584.91s]  Oh, I'm out of here. I'm in the clear right now, guys.
[584.91s -> 589.46s]  This is it. Beautiful.
[589.46s -> 592.91s]  Get that train in here.
[592.91s -> 598.10s]  Oh, boy. He's coming back. Crap.
[598.10s -> 600.66s]  Come on. Before this guy gets over here, let's go.
[600.66s -> 605.58s]  Get on the train.
[605.58s -> 607.58s]  What? What? What?
[607.58s -> 610.70s]  Oh, boy.
[610.70s -> 613.01s]  Hello.
[613.01s -> 615.01s]  How are you? Let me just get in the train.
[615.01s -> 617.94s]  I'm just getting
[617.94s -> 619.94s]  in the train. Oh, no.
[619.94s -> 623.78s]  Let me in the train.
[623.78s -> 626.21s]  Let me in the train. Open the doors.
[626.21s -> 632.35s]  I made it in the train. I made it in the train.
[632.35s -> 634.59s]  Yes.
[634.59s -> 638.94s]  All righty. Here it is,
[638.94s -> 641.76s]  ladies and gentlemen. That was a
[641.76s -> 643.76s]  long mission. That took a long time.
[643.76s -> 647.28s]  I only had one restart.
[647.28s -> 650.48s]  Dual welding expertise, cool.
[650.48s -> 652.48s]  Pure instinct, cool.
[652.48s -> 655.30s]  Hand-to-hand, cool.
[655.30s -> 658.82s]  Okay, let's take a look here. Burning Hotel, the library,
[658.82s -> 660.82s]  Xing Riya train station.
[660.82s -> 663.50s]  35,000 points.
[663.50s -> 665.68s]  This one, this
[665.68s -> 667.68s]  Xing Riya one got screwed up.
[667.68s -> 669.68s]  Because I had to kill like five people.
[669.68s -> 671.68s]  Well, actually one person, but you know, you get the idea.
