[4.41s -> 11.21s]  Yes, so take some wine please. Someone's buzzing my apartment. I might go see who it is.
[17.88s -> 27.58s]  That's a good berry wine. Who is it? Hey! Hey! It's my good friend MLC Sterls. Come on in.
[27.58s -> 35.02s]  I've got some fresh wine for you. See it's right here. It's a Cabernet from the year 1444.
[35.83s -> 42.49s]  This is your Christopher Columbus sail to sea. Do you know that? I love Cabernet. Yes, yes it's good.
[42.49s -> 54.68s]  Take some please. Please have some. Please have some please. Ah yes. Now you. Let's have some more
[54.68s -> 67.40s]  wine. Let's have some more wine. Oh yes. Oh yes. Yes. Oh yes. What's this? Is it wine? I haven't had
[67.40s -> 73.35s]  this in so long. It's been at least five seconds since my last glass. My screen is shaking.
[73.35s -> 77.67s]  There is a dude behind us. We better get going. He's behind us. Maybe there's a dude behind us.
[77.67s -> 81.99s]  He's coming. There's a guy behind us. Maybe he's just gonna get in the car. He's gonna get in the
[81.99s -> 87.67s]  car. Is he just gonna get in? There's not enough space in the car. He's gonna shoot us. It's a two
[87.67s -> 96.07s]  door. We better leave. No, it's a two door. He's kicking the door. Hey, cut it out. He has a knife.
[96.87s -> 102.65s]  Put the knife down. There's no reason for this. Look, let me get out and I'll like just listen.
[102.65s -> 107.13s]  I know I have your insurance. My insurance. We'll work things out. We'll exchange papers.
[107.13s -> 119.72s]  I'll send it to you tomorrow. Take us up to the top of this fucking mountain. This looks really
[119.72s -> 127.75s]  stupid. Why? I'm in first person just behind you and it looks like it looks like one of those old
[127.75s -> 132.79s]  80s movies where you're in front of like a green screen and you're like apparently driving right
[132.79s -> 143.18s]  now. Oh wow, look out. This looks really great on my fucking green screen. This looks so stupid.
[153.70s -> 167.83s]  I'm just like eating. Oh my god, that is 90 degrees. That was 90 degrees. Yeah,
[167.83s -> 171.19s]  I don't think I'll be able to get down the whole mountain. You're gonna try to get down the whole
[171.19s -> 177.91s]  mountain like that. Sure. Oh no. Speaking of going down the whole mountain. Oh no.
[181.66s -> 184.94s]  This is a terrible place to do this. I don't know why I keep trying to do that.
[184.94s -> 192.06s]  It's not gonna happen. Okay, see ya. See ya. Oh I'm alive.
[199.83s -> 208.47s]  And here's the mountain. Push me. All my lights, bro. Push me. Push me. I need a push.
[208.47s -> 217.32s]  Push me, mummy. Push me, mummy. Thank you for the boost. Oh no, you're fine. You fucking idiot.
[218.04s -> 224.26s]  My bike. You need to land this plane and the nose has to be directly in front of me just like that
[224.26s -> 232.12s]  movie Supergun with Thomas Cruise. I'm going really fast. You are going like kind of fast,
[232.12s -> 243.74s]  but it's okay. You'll get it. Yeah, you did it. Can you take a selfie? No, I just have it like
[243.74s -> 254.01s]  zoomed in on your face. Oh no. Oh no. That's great. That's good. That's great.
[261.93s -> 265.85s]  Your guy's face is as if nothing is happening.
[270.52s -> 281.32s]  He is like, I've got a big deal. I'm just driving. Well, oh well. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[281.32s -> 286.60s]  hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on a second. Don't move. Do not move. I can't move.
[294.95s -> 298.28s]  Hold on. Don't, don't, don't, don't. I want to get like a first person look at you.
[299.80s -> 304.28s]  I want to like take a picture of you. I'm rocking out to the music. What are you doing? Yeah,
[304.28s -> 310.68s]  you're rocking out to the music. What a sick fuck. It's scary on my wayward son. Your character is
[310.68s -> 327.98s]  a psycho. How beautiful of a sight is this? Hey, I just love sitting here parked looking outside
[327.98s -> 345.58s]  of the wonderful islands and all the other great stuff in this wonderful world. Oh my gosh. This
[345.58s -> 354.26s]  game is so fun just to drive over mountains, the fly. All right. Caps coming. All right. Well,
[354.42s -> 359.99s]  I got us a cab. Do we both get in the cab? Um, I don't know. Well, don't get in it yet.
[361.43s -> 368.20s]  Okay. Um, hi. That's not a cab. That's not a cab at all. That's a, uh,
[369.08s -> 373.29s]  what kind of cab company sends a fucking chopper and shoots you.
[391.26s -> 400.89s]  This bottle is from Thomas Jefferson, circa 17 BC. Let's get, oh yeah, that's got some aroma to it.
[400.89s -> 406.18s]  Oh yes, that's got a very nice little flavor to it. Kind of reminds me of poison.
