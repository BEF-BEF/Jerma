[1.46s -> 12.02s]  Hey. Hey. Hey everybody. What? Oh, this is crazy. Homelands. I just saw you like earlier today.
[12.02s -> 20.57s]  Did I see you earlier? We ran into each other earlier today? That's weird. The same day. I
[20.57s -> 24.41s]  didn't know you shopped at this this grocery store. I just saw you at the gas station
[24.97s -> 31.11s]  earlier today. God, I would say, how are you? But we already talked about that.
[34.76s -> 44.78s]  Uh, welcome back everybody. It's true. I saw Jerma at the gas station and he went like this,
[44.78s -> 53.00s]  this, this. Uh, hi guys. Today, uh, we're going to continue the trend that we've had the last
[53.00s -> 58.82s]  three days. Uh, somebody just wrote, please tell me you're going to play Muppets Party Cruise.
[61.14s -> 65.91s]  I don't have that. I'm really sorry to tell you I do not have Muppets
[66.63s -> 77.21s]  Party Cruise. It's not like I put it in the title. Sometimes we forget about this.
[78.17s -> 86.98s]  There were four thousand PS2 games. I'm never going to play them all. All I can do
[86.98s -> 94.60s]  is just get through ones that I remember and ones that look interesting. Why not? He's lying.
[96.10s -> 107.77s]  Not with that attitude. Not with that attitude. No. And I don't just want to look,
[107.77s -> 110.81s]  okay, the same thing happened with the, uh, the VR stuff, right? Like I really want
[110.81s -> 116.31s]  to play a bunch of these and give them the time that they deserve. That's why we're
[116.31s -> 120.39s]  going back and forth because there's a shitload more VR stuff I want to do. We got to take a
[120.39s -> 128.74s]  break. We're getting ping ponged between VR and old console stuff. He's back. He knew my stream
[128.74s -> 134.22s]  was turning on, so he just drove his car by again. Hey, didn't I see you earlier today?
[134.78s -> 141.42s]  I thought I saw you earlier today at the gas station. He's back. I swear to God,
[141.42s -> 153.83s]  I live in a fucking video game simulation. Are you guys real? Anybody here real? No,
[154.55s -> 161.66s]  no, no, no. I think a lot of us know. Has ever anybody even asked the question to a bot like
[161.66s -> 169.32s]  that? Are you real? Like on Twitch? They have to answer correctly, right? AI has to give the
[169.32s -> 178.09s]  correct answer. That's actually kind of scary. Anyways, just letting people trickle in while
[178.09s -> 185.59s]  we hang out for a minute. Oops, that's a bunch of disks. Yeah, we're going to go back to VR
[186.31s -> 192.87s]  after obviously this weekend was PlayStation 2, and I did see quite a few people a little
[192.87s -> 199.94s]  bit angry with me for a good reason, because I did say yesterday that I was going to play,
[199.94s -> 202.66s]  hey guys, start with Clock Tower 3, and we're going to play a bunch of other shit.
[203.54s -> 206.98s]  And then I played Clock Tower 3 for nine hours and beat the whole game in one sitting.
[208.50s -> 213.30s]  I had a great time. I thought it was a fun stream. Hey, that just means we get to do
[213.30s -> 220.52s]  it again. You know what I'm saying? I thought that was a lot of fun. So speaking of fun,
[220.52s -> 224.04s]  I'm not sure what to start with today, because there's a chance that I might just get locked
[224.04s -> 234.12s]  into one of these. I'm thinking we start with... It's tough. I don't know. I don't
[234.12s -> 240.47s]  want the same thing to happen. The same thing can happen. Should we start off with Stuntman?
[244.54s -> 250.95s]  I can't get stuck in Stuntman. That's not possible. I also have Stuntman Ignition,
[250.95s -> 267.96s]  but I can't play that one first. Which one of them is better? Stuntman Ignition is so good.
[268.52s -> 278.09s]  No, but don't get me stuck here. Ignition is better. All right, well, let's get a taste of
[278.09s -> 286.54s]  the good one. Don't let me get stuck here. I will. Where's Metal Gear Solid 3? Actually,
[286.54s -> 290.30s]  I was talking to Italics about that the other day, about how that was my favorite Metal
[290.30s -> 301.85s]  Gear game. Okay, here we go. We're going to play Stuntman Ignition. I would laugh my ass
[301.85s -> 309.03s]  off if this turns into a Stuntman Ignition, like, six and a half hour stream.
[316.07s -> 326.95s]  It's not going to happen. No, I have to play... I got 25 to life here that has to come up next,
[327.67s -> 330.95s]  but I might get lost in that. Look, it's all right. Even if I get lost in them. I got
[330.95s -> 344.25s]  PsyOps, Freedom Fighters. These are all classics. This is made by THQ, one of the
[344.25s -> 357.11s]  old glorious companies. Paradigm Entertainment. Black Screen. Shouldn't be Black Screen.
[362.63s -> 369.11s]  Every mangled mass of steel has a story to tell. Pretty good Spike TV intro we got going here.
[376.97s -> 384.55s]  So you're a movie actor in this, right? A tale of speed, guts, talent, style.
[389.30s -> 395.26s]  You're a Stuntman. Stuntmans are actors. They have to not only drive the car,
[395.26s -> 404.36s]  but they have to pretend to drive the car. They're gonna be in those camera shots.
[404.36s -> 407.08s]  They have to look like they're fucking really driving as hard as they can.
[422.57s -> 427.13s]  I thought I was watching an ad. Well, you kind of were. You kind of were watching an ad
[427.13s -> 432.39s]  for this game. Stuntman Ignition uses an auto-save feature. I'm actually probably
[432.39s -> 437.93s]  gonna run out of room on this memory card here. There's been a lot of eight megabyte
[437.93s -> 447.56s]  save datas over the last six months on this thing. Well, I guess not. That's gonna be a
[447.56s -> 458.09s]  problem though. All right. Stuntman Ignition. Career. Quick fix. Options. Audio controls.
[458.09s -> 464.23s]  Gameplay. Thrill cams. Oh, this game kind of looks terrible. It's really blurry.
[464.95s -> 478.36s]  This was the game that I properly raged at. Vibration off, always. 75, 75.
[478.36s -> 488.97s]  Arrows on. Okay, we're just gonna keep this shit here. I gotta read the manual, right?
[489.61s -> 502.52s]  This is like every PlayStation game. Okay, handbrake. Brake. Gas. Camera control.
[502.52s -> 509.62s]  Action. And then look right and look left. Isn't it nitro? Okay. Career. What are you
[509.62s -> 517.86s]  doing? Why are you saving every five seconds? Should have got the PlayStation 3 version.
[518.82s -> 560.42s]  Uh-oh. Ricky Langston. Do I have to drive? Dude, I did it. That's an S. That was the audition.
[561.22s -> 564.39s]  That's a very expensive audition.
[577.56s -> 578.60s]  This guy's a real asshole.
[583.32s -> 586.68s]  I'm told this is your first time on a big set so I'll walk you through how it works.
[587.24s -> 590.92s]  We'll have you wired up in your vehicle and your coordinator will call out all the major
[590.92s -> 595.64s]  director stunts we need you to hit, okay? He'll also mark them on your heads-up display
[595.64s -> 601.80s]  with yellow stunt icons. These include drifts, gaps, jumps, closes, and other maneuvers. We'll
[601.80s -> 605.88s]  be using a point system to judge your runs. All the directors do it. It's how we keep track
[605.88s -> 610.60s]  of the drivers in the biz. More precisely you perform, more points you'll earn. Fail
[611.08s -> 611.88s]  We all use it.
[615.24s -> 619.88s]  Oh, do I get to have a strike here with the other stuntmen that are getting fucking abused on set?
[636.36s -> 637.56s]  Yeah, nice to meet you too.
[642.50s -> 643.14s]  There's another one.
[649.54s -> 650.42s]  This is Vegeta.
[653.30s -> 654.42s]  This is Christopher Seabot.
[672.50s -> 675.38s]  A huge finale where the town gets ripped apart.
[675.38s -> 679.06s]  Before each scene I'll give you shots of your key stunts with tips on how to pull them off.
[679.06s -> 682.90s]  Right now this stuntman is probably just sitting there with a dump in his pants like,
[682.90s -> 689.38s]  holy shit, this is my first day. I thought I was gonna have to put on a wig
[690.26s -> 693.06s]  and pretend to be an old lady and fall down in a crosswalk.
[693.94s -> 702.63s]  For your first scene you'll double for the town's trouble-making drifter in his R3000
[702.63s -> 707.99s]  as he flees the volcanic eruption. The highlight will be this huge jump over a burning semi.
[707.99s -> 711.91s]  The key is to hit the ramp straight. That'll set you up for the stunt that follows.
[712.87s -> 716.71s]  As soon as you land you'll have a pair of precision drivers coming at you fast and you'll
[716.71s -> 721.27s]  need to gap between them. It's dangerous so be careful and don't be afraid of retakes.
[721.27s -> 724.63s]  Mr Langston's a picky director and it can take a while to make him happy.
[724.63s -> 734.02s]  Okay um get up excuse me can I go to the bathroom first I kind of have to go to the bathroom
[736.44s -> 744.07s]  all right let's go three two one action gap the cars what what do you mean gap the cars
[747.86s -> 752.02s]  that was my first day this is a tricky set you need to watch out for those hazards
[755.94s -> 760.10s]  oh I thought I was supposed to jump hold on wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
[760.98s -> 782.02s]  I thought I was supposed to jump okay then we turn um what if you destroy the whole town
[783.94s -> 791.05s]  what what oh yeah well we were not authentic we uh we we put a bunch of like hydrochloric
[791.05s -> 795.69s]  acid in a local volcano it wiped out fucking like an entire village but let's at least
[795.69s -> 811.91s]  we got it for the shot right god damn right that was good all right um so
[815.45s -> 817.45s]  I feel like this game's playing in slow motion
[820.55s -> 826.52s]  this is like 640 by 480 it's so blurry in my screen and it's playing at like
[827.56s -> 851.82s]  18 frames a second oh I got it got it they're killing people seriously what the
[851.82s -> 876.86s]  fuck is going on here what how many stunts do I have to do these aren't stunts okay I'm
[876.86s -> 897.62s]  sorry but you are just dropping molten bombs on these people that was too boring too boring
[898.26s -> 905.10s]  you're gonna have like a dead sea scrolls obituary for this 10 minute string here give me
[905.10s -> 923.45s]  a break I got a new car oh with this one we're gonna have you uh fucking jump over the uh
[923.45s -> 927.37s]  ocean your car's gonna get wings you're gonna fly past a plane be careful they go under the
[927.37s -> 933.69s]  plane what the hell are they doing stuntman ignition is all about stunt points and stunt
[933.69s -> 938.97s]  stringing is how you rack up the big numbers every stunt earns you points and goes into your
[938.97s -> 944.09s]  stunt string if you perform a stunt within two seconds of another stunt that will continue
[944.09s -> 949.85s]  your stunt string and add another number to your multiplier now your stunt stringing be
[949.85s -> 954.09s]  sure to watch your stunt indicator on the upper left it tells you what stunt you just
[954.09s -> 959.05s]  performed and how long you have until your string breaks you have to stunt before the string
[959.05s -> 964.33s]  fades out if it breaks your string will be cashed out and added to your total score on the right
[964.33s -> 969.45s]  what stunts continuous string all of them yeah throw a drift get close to anything in the
[969.45s -> 974.17s]  scene pass through a time gate hit a director stunt jump a ramp you get the idea look for
[974.17s -> 978.17s]  different ways or objects throughout the course to keep your string alive now if you
[978.17s -> 983.85s]  want that fifth star you're gonna have to string it that means keep a continuous string from your
[983.85s -> 990.17s]  first stunt to your last your total score should read zero if you string the entire level together
[990.17s -> 995.45s]  try the stringing rehearsal and see if you can do it and by the way after you do all this
[995.45s -> 1000.17s]  the actor's gonna come out of their trailer go where you were at the time of the cut
[1000.17s -> 1010.41s]  say three sentences and then go back in their trailer what a fucking hard job string the
[1010.41s -> 1034.20s]  scene action all right let's string it how do i handbrake oops on the car something's wrong
[1034.20s -> 1053.58s]  with the car the drift is what jump god damn it do it again do it again do it again all right
[1054.54s -> 1067.42s]  it's not as much as a drift as it is a hard stop yeah that's not really a drift
[1068.06s -> 1089.86s]  this would be good done there's more no there's not okay passed next scene all right
[1089.86s -> 1094.42s]  today's run will be the drifters last scene when he tries to escape the town and gets torched by a
[1094.42s -> 1099.62s]  lava boulder at the end the feature stunt is the pyro charge as you cross over a certain
[1099.62s -> 1104.26s]  lava fissure in the ground which will mark on your HUD trigger the charge and set your car on
[1104.26s -> 1110.02s]  fire get hot but you'll be wearing a cool suit once you're lit drift hard to the right
[1110.02s -> 1116.02s]  and gap through the car wash that'll extinguish the car wash onto the big finale remember kid
[1116.02s -> 1120.66s]  watch out for that lava yeah by the way our director is a real fucking psycho
[1121.38s -> 1132.14s]  he's decided to make a mouse trap in real life there aren't any actors here so what was
[1132.14s -> 1152.18s]  it getting lit on fire action i'm dead there you go three two one action hit the object got
[1152.18s -> 1172.87s]  it there's a real volcano here all right hit the right here okay i see why are there other
[1172.87s -> 1218.98s]  people driving that was just the time crisis guy get in the get beautiful come jump they just
[1218.98s -> 1231.27s]  threw a car at us oh shit yeah the really hard part was donkey kong was really expensive to
[1231.27s -> 1258.89s]  hire for this no come on just edit it why do we have to do this in one take they're all
[1258.89s -> 1264.01s]  one-upping each other now now didn't you see birdman yeah we have to do that with these
[1264.01s -> 1296.58s]  fucking horrible stunts they've raised the bar for us yeah watch it seamless it was it was
[1296.58s -> 1305.69s]  that was better than last time watch you watch we're gonna watch the guy throw the car
[1307.13s -> 1327.46s]  did i not hit him oh what was wrong with that i killed that guy i killed that guy
[1328.34s -> 1356.36s]  is that it i didn't ignite so wait a minute you're telling me that christopher sabat the voice of
[1356.36s -> 1386.84s]  vegeta is the guy that says action in time crisis really wow this is the movie this is
[1386.84s -> 1414.15s]  the scene from the movie pretty good i wish there was dialogue over this that was pretty
[1414.15s -> 1419.83s]  good my window smashed even look at how good look at how talented i am as a driver
[1420.55s -> 1434.78s]  i hope nobody was in there it's the windshield you blame it on the windshield that could be like a
[1434.78s -> 1440.06s]  comedy part of the movie well like there's got to be like a sassy british guy in here
[1441.26s -> 1445.02s]  i can't see out of the fucking window might end up like arguing back and forth and that
[1445.02s -> 1468.70s]  happens and there's no more dialogue all right two two motorcycle we're gonna get stuck here
[1468.70s -> 1474.14s]  let's talk motorcycles kid directors love them because they're fast and loud and punch to any
[1474.14s -> 1479.18s]  scene but they're also harder to control more dangerous so watch out or they'll be mopping
[1479.18s -> 1484.86s]  your skull off the pavement there are two major stunts unique to the bike first is the wheelie
[1484.86s -> 1489.98s]  it's a great way to start any motor run and keep your strings alive pull back on the left
[1489.98s -> 1494.06s]  analog stick as you hit the gas pull back that front wheel and while you hit the gas push
[1494.06s -> 1499.90s]  forward to drop back down then there's the slide to pull it off perform the action as
[1499.90s -> 1504.06s]  you pass through the designated stunt box okay that'll make you lay the bike down on
[1504.06s -> 1510.22s]  one side while you're still barreling forward so in the box how do you do the slide is simple
[1510.22s -> 1517.35s]  as that what combination buttons is it he just said do it you got to be in the stunt box
[1518.33s -> 1524.06s]  is it just it's just simple it's just simple the action button which is what's the action
[1524.06s -> 1549.80s]  button triangle okay here we go one action pop a wheelie press triangle drift left close to the
[1549.80s -> 1588.20s]  crates oops drift left good slide i press triangle u-turn nice what u-turn all right
[1588.20s -> 1601.56s]  so what do i do wrong there not path let me do again hit the dab action all right
[1601.56s -> 1642.76s]  slide slide under i'm pressing triangle right under uh so three square is the slide button
[1643.48s -> 1660.82s]  action so it's not trying it's square no that's not it either r1 trip left i'm not on the
[1660.82s -> 1677.74s]  bike anymore it's r1 three one action r1 there we go it is r1 triangle
[1680.38s -> 1692.44s]  this is fun i just wish we were in a higher resolution
[1703.56s -> 1720.46s]  all right good good get the jump with a wheelie all right pass god damn it
[1720.46s -> 1728.01s]  okay i passed we're fine in this scene you'll be doubling for a desperate team racing through
[1728.01s -> 1732.23s]  the carnage to rescue his grandmother in her mountain cabin the key stunt begins
[1732.23s -> 1739.19s]  you'll be the grandmother i can't i'm sorry keep it high speed when you land then a blast will
[1739.19s -> 1743.59s]  hurl a couple of cars finally get to be the grandma serious force dodge under the flying
[1743.59s -> 1748.31s]  cars by sliding the bike like we rehearsed after the slide you'll move real quick into
[1748.31s -> 1753.27s]  a hard drift left so be ready for it continue up the mountain and end at the grandmother's
[1753.27s -> 1756.31s]  house
[1760.97s -> 1781.24s]  dodge under the flying cars why are there flying cars drift i was doing a wheelie for no reason
[1784.33s -> 1798.15s]  one action this game is on the 360 and ps3 well fuck me really that's live
[1799.38s -> 1813.24s]  close left there are better versions it's way better on those i didn't know why is it on ps2
[1813.88s -> 1851.46s]  why would it be on ps2 left the original was on ps2 fuck turn left more time added left
[1853.22s -> 1855.78s]  come on get on the bike get on get

[1947.40s -> 1950.52s]  predict that was gonna happen should have got extra points for that one
[1956.63s -> 1963.30s]  these days all these fucking little shits all they use is cgi back in the day he used to get
[1963.30s -> 1982.84s]  actually hit by fucking cars that's the end of the movie those camera angles suck scene earth
[1982.84s -> 1988.12s]  shake all right we get the earth shake scene movies aren't shot in order as i hope you
[1988.12s -> 1993.32s]  know what scene comes just before volcano climb while the teen's still trying to get out of
[1993.32s -> 1997.40s]  town and up to his grandmother the big moment here comes early in the run
[1997.40s -> 2001.24s]  when you take the ramp over a major drop and smash through a burning billboard
[2002.28s -> 2006.44s]  keep in control when you land so you can navigate across the fiery rooftops
[2006.44s -> 2010.68s]  and take the smaller jump that follows you'll really be putting your body on the line here
[2010.68s -> 2016.04s]  kid i kind of want to play team standing should i just get this for ps3 and just like
[2016.04s -> 2025.38s]  play up to where i am now i feel like i feel like this is a whole stream

[3052.97s -> 3063.35s]  know is i got like six of them back here did this just say bullshit what was what did it just
[3063.35s -> 3072.09s]  say in the days of its infancy the stunt performer's profession was pioneered by the
[3072.09s -> 3079.05s]  daring and ingenuity of acrobats and circus acts as the public's demand for on-screen chases
[3079.13s -> 3086.49s]  crashes jumps smashes and explosions is never satisfied so the stunt performer has evolved into
[3086.49s -> 3093.69s]  a highly trained professional this is real footage for the timid this is where men and women
[3093.69s -> 3097.45s]  we really did default we went down to like to make it happen back to like the 20s
[3112.97s -> 3117.42s]  holy shit somebody's in that car
[3118.30s -> 3148.86s]  motion insane hundred pounds of pressure all right here we go stuntman the original
[3149.82s -> 3187.50s]  the first one stuntman career stunt constructor uh setup dvd extras this is a movie wait is this
[3187.50s -> 3193.37s]  for the terrible one that's for 64 and everybody hated this is one of the worst
[3193.37s -> 3221.35s]  games ever made isn't it over 40 minutes of cinematics it's making it crusty well don't
[3221.43s -> 3227.82s]  say that and not give us any you gotta give us a clip you didn't voice acted by the original
[3227.82s -> 3238.20s]  cast what you're not going to hear a sample of in the trailer shadow of apocalypse that's not

[3325.67s -> 3334.33s]  he's not driving a car it was a door for the car okay this is driver three you don't think
[3334.33s -> 3342.60s]  you should have a car in the trailer the closest thing that an elevator was the closest
[3342.60s -> 3358.66s]  thing to a moving automobile in that whole trailer for driver three he'd think he'd say no
[3362.70s -> 3373.32s]  but we push it right to the edge the whole commercial play it's on the playstation 3 e
[3373.32s -> 3378.68s]  shop for 10 bucks i can download it while i'm playing this well i have that that's not

[3445.48s -> 3454.62s]  clips me it's anybody's guess where it spins me what is that part of the movie or is that guy
[3454.62s -> 3463.13s]  talking about how he was going to get hit my car and possibly die what toothless in whapping
[3463.85s -> 3475.46s]  that was going to happen i might get clipped and then get shown on the internet somewhere on my
[3475.46s -> 3479.06s]  community of people they've taken me out of context and clipping me saying something stupid
[3479.94s -> 3484.71s]  and like posting it in places and now i look like an asshole gangster comedy two hopeless
[3484.71s -> 3491.75s]  small timers up against the police and gangland kingpin the dentist one of the leads vince is
[3491.75s -> 3497.83s]  trying to get across town for a pickup but he's already late i'll have constant radio

[3535.13s -> 3548.06s]  e-brake is way more sensitive in the original version it's even crustier i mean you're talking
[3548.06s -> 3556.46s]  about you on your special instructions on your online order at pizza hut you said leave it in
[3556.46s -> 3572.81s]  the oven for an extra 10 minutes how is that not a 180 yeah not only that you said views twice

[3687.13s -> 3699.93s]  have to do it i don't think it's like you did it yeah it's okay you just have to do it

[11520.58s -> 11525.14s]  what did you give me first things first you don't have security clearance but if you
[11525.14s -> 11530.10s]  trip the switch all security beams will go down then you can make your way to the elevator
[11530.10s -> 11536.07s]  to get to the second floor here's the keys the generator here's my american express before they
[11536.07s -> 11541.16s]  discover you've escaped be careful where you use it though because nobody takes it anymore
[11541.88s -> 11568.42s]  let me get my institute for that come on what's in your wallet not like this my gate
[11568.42s -> 11575.13s]  training facility 12 years ago telekinesis training here we go all right nick let's start
[11575.13s -> 11581.45s]  your telekinesis training to keep it simple i'm going to start referring to telekinesis as tk from
[11581.45s -> 11588.01s]  now on tk also we've juiced you up with unlimited psi powers during this test hey thanks in the
[11588.01s -> 11595.59s]  real world all psi powers drained with you we'll skip the spoon binding and start by
[11595.59s -> 11603.99s]  controlling tk5 first select a target to tk by moving the aim retapool over the object first
[11603.99s -> 11607.99s]  always refer to the hut for control instructions stand at the edge of the map
[11608.79s -> 11613.75s]  and do tk pulse to the three friends you're playing with it's guaranteed that you'll
[11613.75s -> 11616.95s]  fucking annoy the hell out of them and they won't want to play with you anymore
[11617.99s -> 11627.11s]  okay target object with aim okay pressing hold l1 select and lift ob so l1 is selecting
[11627.11s -> 11633.64s]  the lift object and right analog stick if you haven't figured it out nick the telekinesis
[11633.64s -> 11639.48s]  button is pressure sensitive so the pressure applied determines the height of lift i got
[11639.48s -> 11643.80s]  that's not going to work with my shitty mad cats controller to continue your training
[11644.84s -> 11652.34s]  do i even have that my pressure sensitive button is not that's not going to work
[11657.32s -> 11663.40s]  all right nick next i want you to get over this wall it's too high for you to jump a
[11663.40s -> 11671.85s]  climb over so use tk to arrange and stack so you admit press and hold l1 to select
[11671.85s -> 11680.42s]  and lift object move object with the right analog stick and release it uh yeah so i'm just
[11680.42s -> 11697.42s]  gonna jump over them okay that's easy enough why do i have two two minutes and 43 seconds
[11697.42s -> 11710.90s]  today i just tried to jump come on why are you turning to the left climb it nice climbing
[11710.90s -> 11716.18s]  nick i want you to use telekinesis to move a crate through each hole in the wall this
[11716.26s -> 11721.14s]  is just destroy all humans but with less hey laughing my ass off don't throw the
[11721.14s -> 11725.14s]  crate easily first get a crate through the hole on the lower left
[11732.50s -> 11737.66s]  move crate through the hole press the yeah until it's at the desired height move the object with
[11737.66s -> 11758.23s]  the right analog stick mm-hmm god damn god damn it guys i don't think i can play this with
[11758.87s -> 11787.54s]  dumb bootleg controller okay let's try it again what i want you to use telekinesis to move
[11792.50s -> 11802.25s]  oh the left hole okay i'm pressing it as lightly as possible i think it can i oh man this is
[11802.25s -> 11815.51s]  gonna be hard to do all right i can get it now move a crate through the hole in the center
[11816.39s -> 11829.99s]  i can get the ones that are tall now pick up a crate for the last hole
[11831.30s -> 11838.55s]  okay the multi lift high for a normal tk lift you will need to use a technique called tk
[11838.55s -> 11844.07s]  multi lift refer to the herd to walk you through the technique release lift an object
[11844.07s -> 11849.03s]  to its maximum height release l1 then quickly press and hold l1 again to lift an object
[11849.03s -> 11863.96s]  higher okay so you go like this and then you it's all the way at the top okay come back this
[11863.96s -> 11876.17s]  way good job the next section is through the door behind you now to the good stuff let's use
[11876.17s -> 11881.21s]  telekinesis to throw objects at live targets but don't worry these guys can't wait this is
[11881.21s -> 11888.09s]  gonna be great first use tk to throw a crate at the stationary test subject these guys just
[11888.09s -> 11894.87s]  stump man with the right analog stick in the direction of test subject and then release l1 to
[11894.87s -> 11895.75s]  throw object
[11905.03s -> 11913.77s]  now try and hit a moving target okay well i doubt i got it that guy was moving
[11914.49s -> 11925.75s]  this guy's just trying to run away now isn't it finally try to hit a moving on an irregular
[11925.75s -> 11938.31s]  oh please god don't hit me got him now that you you can also tk most enemies
[11938.31s -> 11943.35s]  take up that guy and throw him against the wall a few times his weapon will drop after he
[11944.07s -> 11963.18s]  dies okay let's try it again that was cool oh god damn it now to the good
[11972.18s -> 11979.11s]  now killing people in training that's good fun isn't it it is good fun you're right
[11979.11s -> 11989.99s]  trying to hit a target moving on an irregular path oops no no shake the gun out of this guy
[11991.59s -> 12004.74s]  that didn't count no no no no no no let you practice throwing objects you can all
[12004.82s -> 12009.86s]  right from against the wall pick up that guy and throw him against the wall a few times
[12009.86s -> 12016.60s]  his weapon will prop damn keep throwing them into walls this is not even a training exercise
[12016.60s -> 12023.77s]  that guy just shot actual bullets at me now tk the next time and while he's in the air
[12023.77s -> 12039.27s]  use your weapon to shoot it so i did the first guy you've got it nice okay fun there's
[12039.27s -> 12044.15s]  another gun right in front of you nick target it and tk throw it to yourself to collect the ammo
[12044.95s -> 12053.30s]  oh that's cool all right let's see how you handle a live combat situation soldiers will charge
[12053.30s -> 12058.42s]  into the room and attack you from all sides try and use cover while eliminating the threats
[12059.91s -> 12065.67s]  use the explosive barrels to your advantage you can also use the assault rifle but don't rely on
[12065.67s -> 12071.75s]  your gun kill the designated number of enemies using tk in some way you have limited health and
[12071.75s -> 12077.83s]  tk firearm kill five enemies using tk within the time limit use assault rifle if needed

[12964.39s -> 12977.53s]  uh that's like the beginning of the game does take me anywhere well i thought that was a person
[12977.53s -> 12988.50s]  he threw a gun away with full ammo yeah but i got the new secret loot one what's that

[13003.05s -> 13006.41s]  the default assault rifle that you get at the beginning of the game that's the only
[13006.41s -> 13024.09s]  weapon i think i've ever seen in that game all right this is the cell okay which i just keep
[13024.89s -> 13040.18s]  i don't know where the fuck i'm supposed to go this is the guard room
[13049.96s -> 13055.80s]  huh there's so many halo boomers in the chat

[13138.18s -> 13160.84s]  what remote viewing enabled manga anime netflix adaptation in the the big brain exploding
[13163.18s -> 13169.02s]  now it's time to learn remote viewing or rb for short remote viewing is an out-of-body stealth
[13169.02s -> 13174.62s]  skill that allows you to go through doors and around obstructions when using rb you won't be
[13174.62s -> 13180.78s]  able to attack press the remote viewing button then move around like you normally would press
[13181.58s -> 13188.62s]  nice mean remember nick you can go right through doors take a walk through walls now use rb to
[13188.62s -> 13193.98s]  help find the computer terminal that unlocks the door so left to activate rv use the left
[13193.98s -> 13199.34s]  analog stick to move find computer terminal psi energy drains faster while moving in an rv
[13200.94s -> 13237.18s]  i thought i thought i could go through walls oh i hate this oh can i never use this i'm
[13237.18s -> 13246.41s]  never going to use this ability in the whole game this is what it feels like you guys want
[13246.41s -> 13259.56s]  to know what it feels like to be blackout drunk it's like that this is what it's like
[13259.56s -> 13266.34s]  you don't want to be like this now move ahead and exit the door by the terminal to get to
[13266.34s -> 13288.79s]  the next test my eyes kind of hurt actually after that next test why would you put a red
[13288.79s -> 13293.59s]  barrel there use remote viewing to observe the path of a god find cover and keep your
[13293.59s -> 13302.57s]  body hidden while you're in rv pk mine migraine find cover in high press left activate rb
[13302.57s -> 13311.22s]  use rb to observe enemy behavior so let's get the cover i don't have to okay i can

[13376.26s -> 13397.32s]  right cool shit can i pull out now now sneak attack and eliminate his enemy from behind the
[13397.32s -> 13404.04s]  close range without being discovered so now i know what his route is he comes around here

[13439.86s -> 13453.38s]  yeah give this guy a medal nice work what's next this one's easy nick rb into the next room
[13453.38s -> 13458.50s]  and watch the enemy's patrol movement then sneak past the enemy without being detected
[13464.90s -> 13485.75s]  what how am i supposed to sneak past you're good at that sneaking around stuff now let's
[13486.31s -> 13492.71s]  thank you this is a good one but be careful nick if they discover you there you fail the test

[14243.26s -> 14247.82s]  i've been brainwashed it's an awful idea memory to hide your psi abilities from
[14247.82s -> 14252.38s]  the movement probes when you were captured the shot i gave you should help reawaken your
[14252.62s -> 14258.22s]  powers no this is crazy deny it all you want but how else can you explain well i'm still going

[14318.39s -> 14323.91s]  mind drain absorb psionic energy from another person's brain next game resident champ
[14326.26s -> 14331.14s]  we'll start off with the basics eliminate this guard however you'd like then i'll tell you
[14331.14s -> 14342.87s]  how to drain okay kill the guard i'm not gonna lie i wasn't even looking at the screen i'm
[14342.87s -> 14356.52s]  looking at one of the game i had here i can't pick him up i couldn't pick him up
[14356.52s -> 14363.56s]  close to the body then press and hold the mind drain button so r2 is mind drain the drain will
[14363.56s -> 14368.68s]  end automatic draining a dead body only replenishes part of your energy okay to replenish
[14368.68s -> 14373.24s]  all of your energy you need to drain a live target we'll try that in the next group so
[14373.24s -> 14377.40s]  electrocute somebody's brain till you suck out other energy got a live target now you can
[14377.40s -> 14382.20s]  only drain a person who is unaware of your presence sneak up on the enemy from behind
[14382.20s -> 14390.06s]  until you get close then perform the mind drain sneak up press and hold r2 to execute
[14390.06s -> 14410.10s]  mind drain until he dies you gotta be real close those guys will never get ahead with
[14410.10s -> 14416.26s]  that job sorry let's move on that was pretty brutal who are these people that we're doing
[14416.26s -> 14421.14s]  this to now for something a little tough i want you to sneak up behind each of these guards
[14421.14s -> 14428.42s]  and mind drain them until they pop without being detected by either one go for it so blow up their
[14428.42s -> 14448.97s]  brains all right i'll give it a try what a horrible way to go just microwaving that guy's
[14448.97s -> 14476.84s]  brain nice job nice yeah nice nice work excellent next you replenish your power or die
[14477.24s -> 14483.59s]  oh pretty matter of fact there boss for this last test i'm going to deplete all of your
[14483.59s -> 14489.27s]  side energy to stop then use mind drain to replenish all of your energy within the time
[14489.27s -> 14494.47s]  limit anything goes nick do whatever it takes to get all of your side energy back

[22669.48s -> 22680.10s]  stream without warning yeah but i think to my defense the back of the box it makes it seem like
[22680.10s -> 22688.62s]  it's one of those interesting experiences where it actually says you have 12 hours the clock is
[22688.62s -> 22700.17s]  ticking i'm so glad i did not do that that would have been terrible sticks renegade thanks for
[22700.17s -> 22705.37s]  the 250 two years sub holy shit uh you're worth every month i've subbed to you everyone

[22760.81s -> 22770.95s]  more there are people that are still continuously subbing to this channel for years years in a

[22790.23s -> 22795.75s]  forodian uh no drawing tonight but if you're going to revisit ps2 games again i highly suggest

[22801.35s -> 22810.17s]  good night and keep kicking ass thank you forodian yeah i would definitely suggest anybody
[22810.17s -> 22818.52s]  that has a recommendation throw it get get it in that discord channel i check that recommended
[22818.52s -> 22822.87s]  channel all the time so if there's something you like oh fuck i got a couple of games that
[22822.87s -> 22828.84s]  he would really like to play now it's not guarantee i'm gonna play them but that is the
[22828.84s -> 22834.92s]  appropriate place for you know suggestions because it's cleaner it's easier for me to see
[22835.72s -> 22845.85s]  i can just kind of scroll down and see it but i've used that and a lot of streams have
[22845.85s -> 22854.63s]  come from that recommended channel a lot of them war of the monsters is on ps4 that's cool
[22855.78s -> 22862.28s]  as like a digital download or something but thank you forodian appreciate it
[22863.00s -> 22872.50s]  the thing with the play this ps2 has so many games i could sit here for a month straight

[22876.92s -> 22881.16s]  couple of streams in a row dreamcast two or three streams come back to it maybe another
[22881.16s -> 22888.89s]  time later in the year or something ps2 come back to it another time because i don't want
[22888.89s -> 22896.17s]  to get burnt out on like old weird interesting games i'd rather do them a few times in a row
[22896.17s -> 22903.06s]  put it back in the box for a while come back but i will definitely be making another list
