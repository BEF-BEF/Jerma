[3.70s -> 8.62s]  Oh, everybody's expecting her was expecting me to do a big VR rant.
[10.18s -> 13.82s]  Yeah, like I do every time. Everyone's expecting it. You're like, oh, wait, wait,
[13.82s -> 17.22s]  here it comes. Here it comes. Oh, here it is. Yeah, here it is. Here it comes.
[19.14s -> 24.73s]  I'm not gonna give it to you today. I was gonna go. Let me tell you though. Fuck.
[25.70s -> 31.80s]  Nevermind. I was gonna say fuck VR. Yesterday. All right. Everybody relax.
[32.44s -> 39.60s]  Yesterday. I set everything up. Everything was ready to go. And this, why does this
[39.60s -> 44.60s]  continue to happen? I don't know. I set everything up. Everything's ready to go.
[44.84s -> 51.76s]  It's a beautiful VR space with all this cool stuff. Right. I get up this morning.
[52.28s -> 58.84s]  And I couldn't, you couldn't download Hitman 3 on Steam. They waited till the
[58.84s -> 65.24s]  last second to even put a Steam store page up. So like, I don't don't get mad.
[66.12s -> 70.60s]  So I literally like three hours ago, you could finally go to the Steam page for
[70.60s -> 78.54s]  this game. And I got it. And I got it ready. And I open up the VR segment. And
[78.54s -> 83.66s]  the shit is just mirrored, just flipped. Everything is just mirrored. I was
[83.66s -> 88.31s]  reading everything backwards. Everything works fine. Is the only program I was
[88.31s -> 95.27s]  using that was flipped horizontally. Steam VR was fine. My other games were
[95.27s -> 101.58s]  fine. My headsets fine. Why was the game flipped horizontally? Dude, I restarted
[101.58s -> 109.81s]  the game like 15 to 20 times. And it's not flipped anymore. I, I don't what
[109.81s -> 114.55s]  happened? What the fuck happened? All right. I'm not gonna go any further. I'm
[114.55s -> 119.27s]  just gonna tell you that Hitman VR is not good. I haven't even played it yet.
[119.63s -> 122.27s]  Everyone just relax for a minute. I need to sleep. Let me just let me just chill.
[126.09s -> 130.77s]  Let me chill. He's gonna cry on stream. What's wrong with your voice? I'm like
[130.77s -> 136.85s]  talking in a weird place. I'm talking I have I'm using the VR headset mic like
[136.85s -> 140.52s]  it did last time. So I'm talking in a weird place. I don't know. Maybe I sound
[140.52s -> 148.88s]  weird. I don't know. Seething. No, I have that like seething voice. Do you guys
[148.88s -> 152.52s]  know exactly what I'm talking about? I like you can tell by the sound of my
[152.56s -> 156.44s]  voice. I'm like seething by the words trail off like it's a little more airy.
[156.44s -> 160.88s]  You know what I mean? Like that's exactly what it is. I've been sitting for three
[160.88s -> 168.10s]  hours every and this happens every time. VR is a $1,000 paperweight. I take that
[168.10s -> 173.26s]  back. I don't mean that. I do. Anyways, I don't mean that. It's actually really
[173.26s -> 184.17s]  fun. I'm so fucking mad. I'm going back and forth with VR Josh like, dude, what's
[184.17s -> 187.77s]  going on? Why is my game flipped? He's like, really trying to help me and stuff.
[187.77s -> 195.17s]  But actually, he had some good tips. So okay. VR is a piece of crap. I hate it. I
[195.17s -> 201.26s]  can't wait to play Hitman VR. Are you guys excited? Don't turn off. Please don't
[201.26s -> 204.46s]  turn off. I don't know. It took me so long to get to this stage. Don't do the beat.
[206.95s -> 210.59s]  Do not turn the fuck off. It took me forever. I downloaded three different
[210.59s -> 217.80s]  programs to get the chat window to show up. Because Hitman VR, don't say it. I'm
[217.80s -> 220.68s]  just drinking coffee. Just chilling out. We're just gonna chill out and drink
[220.72s -> 233.35s]  some coffee. Okay. We're gonna hang out. We're gonna chill. We're gonna drink
[233.35s -> 241.50s]  some coffee. We're gonna hang out. Hi, everybody. The Hitman VR flipped. It's
[241.50s -> 266.98s]  not. For an illusion again. The room's not big. It's a full room. All right. Are
[266.98s -> 273.08s]  you guys ready? Coffee's not good for you. Actually, there was a study that was
[273.08s -> 282.71s]  done. Medicine magazine. Coffee is actually good for your brain. It's
[282.71s -> 286.43s]  actually good for your liver. And then I don't don't drink don't drink like the
[286.43s -> 290.87s]  fucking extra cream extra sugar bullshit. This is what I'm talking about. Don't
[290.87s -> 310.56s]  dump it. It's a black coffee. Just black. That cup is huge. Pretty normal to me. I

[430.58s -> 437.19s]  Welcome to streaming VR where four people need to be in the room for it to
[437.19s -> 444.47s]  work out the way that you want it to. I'm going on another rant. Is that loud? How
[444.47s -> 458.58s]  loud is that? Is it bad? What just happened? Your camera's tilted. Uh, I don't
[458.58s -> 463.82s]  think it is. I think it's an optical illusion, dude. Because that's...
[464.46s -> 473.42s]  No, my camera's not tilted. It's an optical illusion. Is it loud? All right. I
[473.42s -> 477.14s]  gotta get in this. I gotta get into this fucking game right now before I have a
[477.14s -> 490.22s]  meltdown. I gotta turn the audio down for me. Better? All right. Here we go.

[507.12s -> 519.17s]  right. Hitman VR. Hitman. Virtual reality. Where should I go? All right. So
[519.29s -> 526.58s]  where am I going? What destination? What do you think? We can go to Miami? That's
[526.58s -> 530.58s]  Hitman 2, right? I'm not doing the concrete level first. You're out of your
[530.58s -> 540.74s]  mind. That is not happening. Concrete. Concrete. Concrete. Dude, Dubai. All right.
[540.74s -> 543.30s]  You know what? Let's just do Miami because this is like one of the first
[543.30s -> 548.18s]  levels of the second game. I'm very curious how this is gonna be. How
[548.18s -> 555.47s]  is there hair in my nose? I just blew up to get the nose out of, like,
[555.47s -> 559.55s]  the hair out of my nose and I just fogged up the glasses. I don't want to
[559.55s -> 564.82s]  scream because I think it's loud. Okay. Spoiler alert. Doesn't matter. They're
[564.82s -> 574.26s]  all fogged up now. Oh, fuck you, VR. Are you kidding me? I put, like, that fucking
[574.26s -> 581.36s]  gas up there. All right. I don't even care. Yeah. I feel like, I feel like in
[581.36s -> 587.10s]  VR, it's like that I'm, like, getting fitted for a wedding dress. That's how
[587.10s -> 590.40s]  many people need to be in this room to help me. Like, I'm going like this. There's
[590.40s -> 593.12s]  a person with, like, a thing going around my neck and around my, like, my waistline
[594.12s -> 600.49s]  Does this look good? I need five people in here. Help me. All right.
[600.49s -> 605.72s]  Difficulty. Not casual, right? Or should I do? I mean, it's VR. Isn't this gonna be,
[605.72s -> 613.99s]  like, impossible? Let's find out. All right. Here we go. Do I need to play
[613.99s -> 627.26s]  anything? I don't think so. Let's go. Please, God, do casual. Well, it's a little too
[627.26s -> 647.51s]  late now. My shit's all fogged up. All right. Make sure this is tight. We already
[647.51s -> 655.18s]  know this shit. Nice t-shirt. Hey, thanks. We already know this. There's a
[655.18s -> 661.45s]  driver. There's, all right. Okay. Okay. The finish lines. This is actually, okay,
[661.45s -> 673.54s]  this is cool. Can I have a sip? Can I have a sip of that? I feel like, I feel like I'm playing,
[673.54s -> 677.06s]  remember when the Sims did their first-person update? I feel like that's
[677.06s -> 686.89s]  what I'm doing. What's wrong with my body? Am I gonna get in trouble? Why is there a
[686.89s -> 696.35s]  UFO? I didn't even punch him. I just, like, cocked my arm back. What? Listen to me.
[696.35s -> 701.78s]  Okay. This is too real in VR. It's too real. I don't, I can't play it, like, it's
[701.78s -> 710.15s]  too real. What's wrong with my hands? Why am I phasing out? How come nobody cares?
[710.15s -> 725.33s]  Can I get in the picture? Where'd he go? I missed. I'm just a psycho. I'm sorry. No, I don't mean,
[725.33s -> 730.05s]  I don't, all right. You can arrest me. I don't know. I, this is weird. Everybody
[730.05s -> 737.35s]  looking at me. Stop, don't look at me. Stop looking at me. Stop looking at me. I
[737.35s -> 759.48s]  gotta get out of here! What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What's going on? What happened? I punched a guy. I punched a guy. It was me. I punched a guy. This is fucking chaos.

[792.19s -> 808.34s]  Where's the audio? There it is. How's that? All right, we're back. That better? Good. Now it's too
[808.34s -> 826.16s]  loud. Your mic is peaking. I know, man. How bad is the mic peaking? Let me fix it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Check this out. Oh shit. Let me test.
[826.16s -> 845.66s]  Oh, that's better. Okay. Are we in? We're in, right? Yep. Okay. That was too much. That was like a little too much for me. All right, let's get in there.
[847.47s -> 870.60s]  How is anybody reliably supposed to do this? Okay, don't be an idiot. Just be a tourist. That sounds easy. How do I take a picture? How do you take a picture? Just on drugs.
[870.60s -> 882.47s]  Hey, man. Do you know how to work this thing, man? I don't know. Do you know how to work it? There's no batteries in that thing. Oh, man. Sorry.
[882.47s -> 930.30s]  All right. So what do I got to do? Targets up there. Eliminate Sir Knox. Eliminate Robert Knox. All right. I know he's up there. And you're over there. All right. Why do my arms keep doing this? Hello, I'll take that. What is that? View Intel? How do I? What was it? How do I view Intel? Can I have one of those? Oh, wait, I can hold on. Hold up on the left touchpad. Oh, shit. Okay. I was gonna say, where's the map?

Why does your aluminum cans explode? You don't think that's a little dangerous? Why would an aluminum can explode? That's weird, right? All of us can agree that that's really fucking weird. Like, honestly.
[1019.75s -> 1055.20s]  I guess nobody else thinks that that's odd. Oh, you Intel. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Move out of the way. It was the Intel. I feel like I'm just I don't I when you have the other view, you can see what you're doing. I'm just lost at a convention. I hate this. I hate being like get away from me.
[1055.20s -> 1108.83s]  Hold down the left pad. What are you saying? Go to the viewing area and pretend to be one. This is making me sick. I mean, it is VR. I'll try to reduce my movements. All right. What can I what can I just go down here? Oh, food. All right. Can I get fries? Hey, damn me. You damn me to do it. It's a catcher. Everyone's looking at me like I'm a boy. I'm a boy.

[1336.50s -> 1347.24s]  The thing is, I don't even know. There's no mini map. So I don't know where the hell anybody's coming over here. This is hard mode. All right. I got to stuff him in here.
[1348.24s -> 1380.42s]  Do you know what I mean? I can't. There's no mini map. Sorry, man. Okay. All right. We're good. I just got to get the hell out of here. I don't want any weapons or anything on me though, right? No weapons. Don't take any weapons.
[1380.42s -> 1405.14s]  Okay. Now that I'm disguised, that's okay. Just leave it open. Who cares? What about all the bodies? I don't know, man. Like, I'm going to have to leave them. What keeps happening to my arms? What's wrong with my body?
[1405.14s -> 1434.97s]  Oh, it's because I'm moving away from myself. Oh, this is weird. Why am I doing this? Okay. So now let's look at the Intel. Oh, okay. So I'm on this one right now. Key Intel was lost. Oh, nevermind.
[1434.97s -> 1461.15s]  How about a perfect machine? That sounds good. So where is that Intel? They're up there. All right. I'm going to go back up. I think I can actually go back up the whole way, right? Re-center your position with left stick. Oh, shit. Okay, nice.
[1461.15s -> 1501.56s]  All right. So now I'm the mascot. So now I can walk around freely. I don't even care if I could see. All right. We're going to go this way. What's this? Oh, this is cool. Okay. Oh, I made it just in time for it to end. Oh, come on.

[1545.63s -> 1597.43s]  I'm here for the meeting. How are we? Yep. I'm the mascot. I'm here to meet with the guy upstairs. Okay. That's all right. I give the finger. It's a VR game. Okay, over there. This is a just completely different game. It's a whole other experience. Didn't I say this sucks?
[1597.43s -> 1636.61s]  Didn't I say this sucks? I said this sucks, right? Like it before I even played it. I would say the game. I would say the game. A journalist prayed my response protocols have not been set up properly for an interview at this time. Please enjoy. Tap up. There we go. Okay, good.
[1636.61s -> 1656.18s]  The race is entering its final lap. 47. You don't understand. You don't understand. None of you understand. We can't let this stand. We can't let this stand. Are you kidding me? Robots like that? They're gonna they're gonna take over. No, no, we can't let this stand. We can't let this stand.

[1702.10s -> 1731.12s]  That's crazy. Yeah, that's weird. I'm just going around fucking tapping people. Dude, you know, weirdo. Alright, where's my Intel? I'm so distracted. I'm sorry. I just am.

[1756.12s -> 1787.18s]  two hands. All right. Where's my restrict access to the car? Did I lose the Intel? Yes, of course. What was it? Okay. Oh, Robert Knox has a prototype of his RK mark three racing car on display in the Cronstadt Bayside Center. He's so concerned about it that he has ordered the engineers in the Expo building to get him immediately. Should anything happen to the car, it's likely he will come rushing down to fix it himself. Okay, we're gonna fuck up. We're gonna fuck up the car. You got it. Get out of the way. I didn't want to.
[1796.65s -> 1847.38s]  Talk to you. Okay, so I got to miss the car. Our engineers are working. Do not enter. What am I getting in trouble with this? Save it. He's gone. Hi. Hi, I'm back. Okay.

[4063.22s -> 4078.65s]  that's a classic engineer joke whoa what is that stuff anyway
[4078.65s -> 4082.17s]  i think some of the teams are using it to increase car speed
[4082.17s -> 4085.37s]  heard a few cron step mechanics talking about it the other day
[4085.37s -> 4088.97s]  something about nox not wanting to use it because she wants to win on her own
[4088.97s -> 4092.17s]  imagine that okay is it that illegal i don't know
[4092.17s -> 4095.45s]  nox ordered them to put it here so they asked me to put it here
[4095.45s -> 4103.40s]  so i just did that not touching it again sounds like a good idea nice all right
[4103.40s -> 4111.14s]  boosters down here hey bro was that uh there's an octane shit you're talking
[4111.14s -> 4124.49s]  about where's that octane shit right here oh
[4124.49s -> 4127.69s]  that there's a bottle of cronstance patented octane booster mixture
[4127.69s -> 4137.10s]  somewhere in the loading bay okay that's somewhere in here this is
[4137.10s -> 4142.31s]  gonna be such a pain in the ass to find this
[4142.31s -> 4160.07s]  over here octane where's it at blind this vr man it's like a completely
[4160.07s -> 4165.82s]  different world in here that's not it that's a whiskey chug the

[7002.71s -> 7005.99s]  dehydration now he has to deal with this guy
[7005.99s -> 7010.95s]  suffering from urinary retention not his day i think we did this when i
[7010.95s -> 7015.67s]  played this a few years ago screw up the revitalization procedure on miss nox
[7015.67s -> 7020.07s]  i know it's just a simple injection but given his track record these past few
[7020.07s -> 7022.87s]  days well at least i know who's buying his
[7022.87s -> 7027.35s]  beer tonight follow the story mission so it seems cierra nox has jumped on the
[7027.35s -> 7031.03s]  revitalization bandwagon and is scheduled for an injection of
[7031.67s -> 7034.79s]  sure the doctor who is supposed to help her with the procedure
[7034.79s -> 7037.99s]  is preoccupied with a patient who is unable to you
[7037.99s -> 7041.59s]  all right here we go here we go here we go it's in here i gotta get in here

[7055.96s -> 7059.16s]  to use the intercom and call her over the pa system instead
[7059.16s -> 7063.56s]  she should be able to hear it just fine all right as long as it's in hand

[7170.49s -> 7181.32s]  to the game what happened to the game what's going on
[7181.32s -> 7188.58s]  uh did did auto unplug something i think auto may have unplugged their
[7188.58s -> 7200.33s]  cord the game crashed auto um

[7204.66s -> 7214.58s]  hold on oh yeah hitman's gone it's hitman's not even here anymore
[7214.58s -> 7222.58s]  what happened okay i actually the game actually crashed all right hold on let
[7222.58s -> 7235.06s]  me fix this give me one sec uh it's running
[7235.06s -> 7240.52s]  i'm not joking what is it i'm not joking there's a wasp in here
[7240.52s -> 7247.43s]  it's not a wasp in here so here's the real problem
[7247.43s -> 7256.62s]  opening opening hitman is a disaster i when i finally got the game to run
[7256.62s -> 7261.13s]  i couldn't leave it so this is going to be a nightmare
[7261.13s -> 7268.66s]  uh let me see if this works because the game specifically says
[7268.66s -> 7277.54s]  do not open the game if steam vr is open see what happens it's such a mess
[7277.54s -> 7286.42s]  all right hold on play whatever you want i mean i kind of want to keep playing
[7286.42s -> 7296.70s]  this yeah i gotta exit steam vr hold on i have
[7296.70s -> 7360.18s]  to restart steam all right i'm back here's the real
[7360.18s -> 7366.84s]  question i think i lost chat we're about to find out
[7366.84s -> 7370.57s]  because this was the biggest problem that i had with this setting this up was
[7370.57s -> 7374.25s]  every time i opened up the thing that captures chat hitman would like run at
[7374.25s -> 7387.69s]  two fps and crash let's see find out let us find out
[7387.69s -> 7393.05s]  i'm back in vr there's not there's no wasp in here
[7393.05s -> 7397.56s]  all right there we go i should be good let me see if it's still on there can i
[7397.56s -> 7405.14s]  see you guys okay steam is opening vr
[7405.14s -> 7415.98s]  oh my god that's loud shit i lost chat oh please
[7416.42s -> 7422.71s]  you guys can't even see it this is the exact same problem i had last time
[7422.71s -> 7425.43s]  i'm probably have to change games because this took like two hours to set
[7425.43s -> 7429.02s]  up uh and now i physically can't even get
[7429.02s -> 7437.21s]  what the fuck man fucking phd to play hitman 3 in vr
[7437.21s -> 7442.09s]  can i see it come on please load load please
[7442.09s -> 7448.20s]  do it i think i lost the chat i can't play with chat
[7448.20s -> 7458.23s]  if i'm gonna play hitman wait let me try this technically it's
[7458.23s -> 7467.27s]  running shit yeah i can't see chat anymore
[7467.27s -> 7472.57s]  and it's gonna be a huge pain in the ass to get it back or maybe it's not hold on
[7472.57s -> 7485.05s]  give me one more second where are my hands oh come on uh
[7485.05s -> 7497.37s]  oh this is gonna take like an hour to fix play squid game
[7497.37s -> 7502.63s]  next game i'm gonna change games i may have lost the chat for the rest of the
[7502.63s -> 7506.52s]  stream by the way because that was a monumental pain in
[7506.52s -> 7512.23s]  the ass to get that to work especially with hitman it's like a
[7512.23s -> 7518.20s]  fucking nightmare to try to get it to work with this on index for some reason
[7518.20s -> 7522.04s]  let me try one more thing why does everything that launches on day one not
[7522.04s -> 7529.91s]  fucking ever work the way that's supposed to because i
[7529.91s -> 7535.50s]  have like access to this i don't know why i can't open it
[7535.50s -> 7541.05s]  and it technically should be hold on a sec come on come on come on come on
[7541.05s -> 7549.51s]  come on come on come on let me see it fuck i have to
[7549.51s -> 7556.42s]  why do i have to redo the whole thing in this overlay
[7556.42s -> 7559.46s]  all right if this takes more than one full minute
[7559.46s -> 7562.74s]  i want everyone to scream it's been one minute from now
[7562.74s -> 7585.80s]  if it's been one minute scream all right chat is back
[7585.80s -> 7606.39s]  hold on come on dude come on man no no oh it's such a pain in the fucking
[7606.39s -> 7610.82s]  ass it really is i had it and i just lost it
[7610.82s -> 7619.50s]  again where the fuck did it go yeah getting chat on your wrist
[7619.50s -> 7625.42s]  um is like an unbearable process sometimes it's so fucking annoying
[7625.42s -> 7630.46s]  i don't i don't know what's going on it's crashed again
[7630.46s -> 7635.05s]  it's been one minute all right i'm moving on but i still have to set the
[7635.05s -> 7640.49s]  chat up though so it doesn't even matter all right i actually have to go brb
[7640.49s -> 7644.09s]  before i scream into this microphone as loud as i can i bring back
[7644.09s -> 7757.29s]  all right i have restarted a couple times i think i got it
[7757.29s -> 7763.66s]  i believe we're good i could be wrong i hope i'm not wrong we'll find out
[7763.66s -> 7775.48s]  very shortly can you see and guess what oink chats back i just needed to take a
[7775.48s -> 7782.52s]  breather and just not like scream i told you like i was gonna scream
