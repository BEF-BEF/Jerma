[0.70s -> 13.26s]  Alright, so I think it's going. Hopefully there's no problems with the actual stream,
[13.26s -> 29.49s]  because that would not be cool. Twitch.tv. I gotta change this. It says I'm gonna be
[29.49s -> 46.13s]  playing CSGO, but that's not the case. That's gotta be changed. Yeah, the chat is lagging.
[46.13s -> 60.53s]  I can't see any of these. The chat is all screwed up. That is not cool. I don't have
[60.53s -> 64.07s]  a solution to that, so I'm just gonna have to do it, play it by ear, and if something
[64.39s -> 71.98s]  happens, something happens, you know? Oh yeah, I'm trying to see how to spell principal right,
[71.98s -> 80.63s]  if you saw that in the Google chat. How do you spell principal? I don't know. Let's see
[80.63s -> 100.06s]  if I can pop this out. Alright, it's muted. Lower. Just want the chat. Mmm, that's not
[100.06s -> 115.01s]  working for me. That is not working for me. Come on Twitch, get your act together. I'm
[115.01s -> 120.86s]  refreshing the page. If you haven't chat problems, just try refreshing. Maybe that'll help. If
[120.86s -> 137.52s]  not, then I'm not exactly sure what to do. But it's okay. We shall persevere. Right there.
[138.35s -> 147.64s]  Okay, just gonna tell people what's happening on the various social media networks. It's
[147.64s -> 160.36s]  going on Twitter. And then, of course, the Steam group. Steam community groups. The inhumane
[160.36s -> 183.70s]  psychopaths. Party. Twitch. Jot TV. Oh, by the way, I'm also sorry for starting this
[183.70s -> 195.38s]  pretty late. I was trying to get that video up and it was not working. Don't know why,
[195.38s -> 214.27s]  but it just wasn't. Oh, not in all caps. That's me screaming. Woohoo! Fifteen minutes. That
[214.67s -> 234.88s]  was me. And one more. Gotta tell all the people on the YouTubes about it. Channel feed. Streaming
[234.88s -> 254.94s]  TF2 and Flash game. HTTP. Alright. Okay. Good afternoon, morning, evening, night time, whatever
[260.68s -> 274.35s]  it happens to be in your quarters of the world. Welcome to the stream. Oh, Flash Gordon game.
[274.35s -> 277.75s]  So sooner or later here when I get my server up and running, we're not gonna have to do
[277.75s -> 283.69s]  more. It'll just be, hey, I'm in my server. Everyone go there if you want to play. Because
[283.69s -> 289.80s]  now it's kind of like, where are we gonna find a good map to play on? How about the
[289.80s -> 300.11s]  Gold Rush? Alright, Gold Rush it is. Oh, no, wait, never mind. Refresh. It was like fifteen
[300.11s -> 317.40s]  people already in there. How about players are not full. That's fine. Alright, come on.
[317.40s -> 323.74s]  Stop with the refresh. Oh, come on. I just refreshed it again trying to hit stop refresh.
[324.34s -> 336.15s]  Why do you do that? Stop. Okay. How about, ooh, that one is Thunder Mountain. Cough Badlands.
[336.15s -> 347.02s]  King of the Hill Badlands. Here's the IP. Let's get started. And boom, heads in there.
[347.02s -> 361.28s]  All hands on deck. King of the Hill Nucleus should be a rockin' time. It's 4.05 in California,
[361.28s -> 366.40s]  yeah? Yeah, I'm sorry for starting late. I said this before, but I'll say it again. It's
[366.40s -> 371.84s]  probably like seven in the morning or like five in the morning for people that are used
[371.88s -> 376.42s]  to seeing this at like, at least at a reasonable time, and I apologize for that. I usually
[376.42s -> 382.99s]  want to start at around 5.36, but 7.30 is when we're actually starting, and I feel bad
[382.99s -> 390.50s]  for you European guys. That's my fault, and I do apologize. What do I want to do now?
[390.50s -> 401.10s]  Let's go. Oh, I'm sure the audio is good. How's the in-game audio? Should it be lower
[401.10s -> 407.26s]  or higher? How does it sound? Who am I bumping into? You know, I'll stick with the Direct
[415.02s -> 422.02s]  Hit. The chat's still broken. Yeah, I don't know. If you can not see the chat, I apologize.
[422.02s -> 429.16s]  There's nothing I can do. Oh, come on, you scout. Why am I using the...I have to touch
[429.16s -> 438.27s]  you, by the way. Come here! Oh, which way are you going to go? What? What was that?
[438.27s -> 443.67s]  Oh, it was a crit. Oh, okay. Yeah, the chat's not refreshing for me either. So I guess
[443.67s -> 450.85s]  just sit back and relax, and if you're playing, play, I guess. Five, four, three, long one.
[450.85s -> 456.85s]  I'm taking the Direct Hit off. Get rid of this thing. Why am I using the gunboats? What
[456.85s -> 463.63s]  on earth are these on here for right now? I'll keep the half-satoichi on. I'm not very
[463.63s -> 480.34s]  good with the Direct Hit. It's hard. It's very hard to use. Where do you go? Where do you
[480.34s -> 493.10s]  go? Where do you go? I'm going to jump around. What's going on here? Super lag. Super lag.
[493.10s -> 506.70s]  Oh, no. Sentra down. I need help. I'm loaded all my shots in this shotgun. I don't know
[506.70s -> 521.34s]  how that happened. Oh, my God. Come on, something has to change. That's why. Sensitivity was
[521.34s -> 528.42s]  all a little low. I'm going to have to deal with it, though. So when are we going to get
[528.42s -> 536.42s]  an update? When's the Teeny Fortress update coming out? How am I not hitting him? I feel
[536.42s -> 548.24s]  like I'm lagging like crazy. I'm starting to go in a roll here. Ding ding. Oh, here comes
[548.24s -> 557.50s]  Burger Boy. I wonder who that is. That can't be Burger Boy right there, can it? Burger
[557.50s -> 575.82s]  Boy. Hold that point. I wish I could see the chat. I'm refreshing. I can't see the chat.
[575.82s -> 579.34s]  Maybe if I do this, I might be able to see the chat if I go to the dashboard. Maybe just
[579.34s -> 593.17s]  the actual chat is screwed up. Maybe not. Maybe not. Twitch, what the heck? I'm streaming
[593.17s -> 606.73s]  on Twitch because YouTube is usually broken, and I guess not. I guess not, Twitch. Bing
[606.73s -> 622.25s]  bing bing. Oh, I'm going to get headshot. I know it. I know it. Run away. Oh, this guy
[622.25s -> 634.67s]  is screwed. Oh, I thought I killed him. You see that in the kill feed? It was like, oh,
[634.67s -> 646.31s]  nope, you killed the guy behind him. I think that was a dead ringer. I don't think he's
[646.31s -> 661.85s]  dead. Pretty sure he's still alive. Might as well go get some health. Right. Boom. Fire.
[661.85s -> 671.86s]  Oh, no. We've got to get on this. Oh, jump around. So get off your feet and jump around.
[671.94s -> 678.53s]  Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. I don't know what the point of that was. Oh, my god. Oh,
[678.53s -> 692.39s]  no. No. I'm just jumping around like an idiot. I'm not. I'm doing okay. Still no chat. This
[692.55s -> 698.73s]  is what it looks like, by the way, for me. Like, the wheel of death. So I can't answer
[698.73s -> 707.38s]  your questions. Oh, that's stupid. I'm going to try refreshing it again. That's what it
[707.38s -> 725.27s]  looks like. Unfortunately. Did I get the chat back? Did I? Of course not. Of course not.
[725.27s -> 737.09s]  That was a spy. My god. That was a dead ringer. Look out. Look out. Look out. Oh, that's going
[737.09s -> 743.10s]  to kill me. I need the equalizer. I need to put the equalizer on. We're going to lose.
[743.10s -> 755.03s]  If I can help it. Stay on it. Stay on it. Stay on it, my brethren. Get that spy and
[755.03s -> 765.22s]  the scout. Stay on it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yes. Nice job. Nice job. Good
[765.22s -> 775.41s]  job, guys. Look at this guy just like hiding behind like the stakeout area. Oh, now I
[775.45s -> 783.28s]  got the chat. Okay. I just said MGE live streaming. That's the last thing I saw. I was going for
[783.28s -> 788.85s]  an air shot. I'm not hitting people with rockets right now. I think every single one of my
[788.85s -> 803.50s]  kills has been with the shotgun. Except for that one. Except for Burger Boy. Need help.
[803.50s -> 816.21s]  Come on. Hit him. Oh. No. No. No. No. I can't believe I'm that stupid. Oh, my god. What
[818.75s -> 826.08s]  is wrong with me? Yeah, good game, guys. Good game. Oh, my god. I'm just standing there
[826.08s -> 835.85s]  like scratching my butt. What is going on? What the hell is this? What is it? A prop
[835.85s -> 843.78s]  hunt mod? Wow. That's pretty cool. All right. We're going to go in. Whatever this is, I'm
[843.78s -> 855.00s]  using it. All right. Good. Oh, come on. Get hit marked. Get hit mocking. How did I lose
[855.00s -> 865.46s]  all that? I thought I was hitting people. Oh, now I can read the chat. Oh, god. So, yes,
[865.46s -> 871.66s]  I will talk about my Steam Workshop item. Oh, no, Burger Boy. Just punch him. My Steam
[871.70s -> 879.42s]  Workshop item is going well. The modeler behind it, he... Thank you, Optimus Prime. But the
[879.42s -> 883.17s]  modeler behind it, he had to take a little break from modeling because I think he just
[883.17s -> 887.01s]  had some school stuff he was trying to get out of the way and had some family things
[887.01s -> 894.56s]  he wanted to get done. So, it is still going. I got a pretzel in my mouth. I'm sitting here
[894.56s -> 899.24s]  eating pretzels and I can't even like... Yeah, so probably in a couple weeks, I would assume
[899.24s -> 903.54s]  will be more updates on that. And I'm going to die. It's going to take one shot. I'm going
[903.54s -> 910.68s]  to go down. Might as well make it epic. That is a spy. How come I didn't get any medal
[910.68s -> 919.66s]  for this? Was that not really a spy? I swear I bumped into him. I swear to every single
[919.66s -> 927.58s]  deity that exists, I was bumping into that guy. Oh, man. Look at all these dudes in here.
[927.58s -> 936.02s]  Yeah, the pretzels are meeting. They're the small... Look at them. Look at me. I'm like,
[936.02s -> 946.14s]  hey, I got one hand playing it. Okay, okay. Let me wash this down first. Before, I was
[947.47s -> 951.82s]  an idiot. Oh, I got a kill. They're the small cylinder pretzels, like the ones that are
[951.82s -> 956.98s]  the best ones. I'm not a big fan of the really skinny ones. If you guys know what I'm talking
[956.98s -> 963.38s]  about, the tiny little skinny baby pretzels. Eh, not for me. Now, let's actually start
[963.38s -> 979.18s]  playing this game. You know what? I want this. There we go. Are you a spy? I bet you are.
[979.18s -> 988.90s]  Oh, no. Here comes Burger Boy. The insensitive one. Demo ends with spy. I can't. I got to
[988.90s -> 1000.24s]  shoot somebody. Come on. One good meat shot on someone. Do you want some hats? Germa?
[1000.32s -> 1006.75s]  No, I'm good. I'm good to go. Thank you for offering, though. I appreciate that. I don't
[1006.75s -> 1018.57s]  need any items or anything. Oh, boy. Pyro coming in. Come on. Come on. Oh, no. I'm dead.
[1021.08s -> 1029.46s]  I didn't mean to taunt, by the way. I was just trying not to die. The chat is back.
[1029.46s -> 1037.33s]  Thank goodness. Can I play some payload? Of course. I'm going to try and find a good Gold
[1037.33s -> 1045.22s]  Rush or Bad Water map after this. What are we looking like? That's spy. I don't know
[1045.22s -> 1056.55s]  why. I'll put it right here. Give me those hit markers. Oh, gosh darn it. Am I a fan
[1056.55s -> 1064.70s]  of Frank Sinatra? Yeah. Who couldn't be with a voice like that? Luck be a lady tonight.
[1064.70s -> 1072.52s]  Luck be a lady tonight. Luck if you ever kill Germa in Team Fortress. Luck be a scout tonight.
[1072.52s -> 1080.53s]  I apologize for doing that. That was not cool. Oh, my God. I'm going to die again. No. Can
[1081.25s -> 1090.22s]  I make it? Take your bats. Do I make it? Do I make it? Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, come on.
[1091.41s -> 1099.71s]  I had my finger touching. I was reaching for it, too, and everything. Give me a break.
[1099.71s -> 1106.34s]  Oh, well. All right. This time. Every time I get out of spawn, something bad happens.
[1106.34s -> 1117.06s]  Getting kills with a mini sentry. That's one good thing that comes out of all this. I'm
[1117.06s -> 1129.17s]  going to move it. I want it up here. Oh, my God. You toast bastard. How much was TF2?
[1129.17s -> 1135.95s]  TF2 was $10. I think it was originally $20, wasn't it? $19.99 for a while. Then it went
[1135.95s -> 1140.19s]  to $9. Did it ever go to $9.99? I don't remember it being $9.99. Maybe it's because I just
[1140.19s -> 1147.78s]  never bought it. That's a crit. I'm dead. I was trying to strafe and drop down, not
[1147.78s -> 1152.45s]  in the pit, and I ended up landing on the crit. Well, you know what? We're going to
[1152.45s -> 1161.43s]  change this. Oh, by the way, I'm going to say this here just because, you know, it makes
[1161.43s -> 1167.26s]  sense to say it here. I still have to give away 33% of that backpack because it's been
[1167.26s -> 1173.61s]  about five days and the third person still has not responded. So I'm going to give them
[1173.61s -> 1180.21s]  maybe another 48 hours, and if I still don't see anything, we're going to talk about maybe
[1180.21s -> 1187.32s]  another small giveaway, potentially in the stream. So I might not do it. If I do it on
[1187.32s -> 1193.34s]  Twitter, I do it on Twitter, but I've not decided at this point what I'm going to do.
[1193.34s -> 1205.09s]  I'll probably just repick. Ow. Oh, put me out. Put me out. I was behind you. I have
[1205.09s -> 1215.75s]  not played Gotham City Impostors. I heard it's fun, though. Are we going to win? Oh,
[1215.75s -> 1226.76s]  they're going to get it. They are absolutely going to get this. I'm going up here. I'm
[1226.76s -> 1232.34s]  absolutely going up here. I'm protecting this room. This health is mine for the rest of
[1232.34s -> 1241.36s]  this god damn game. Oh my god. What's going on? What? What is it? What's happening? Oh
[1242.86s -> 1252.88s]  my god. During the live stream. Um, hold on. Hold on a sec. That just took me totally off
[1253.56s -> 1262.37s]  guard. Um, thank you so much for that. Hold on. Let me accept it. Hold on. Let me even
[1262.37s -> 1270.52s]  see what just even happened. Hold on. I got to duck away for one second. Oh, we won. Okay,
[1270.52s -> 1279.66s]  cool. What is that? What's happening right now? Where is it? You've received a gift.
[1279.66s -> 1287.78s]  Total War Shogun 2. Oh my god. Oh, this is from my wedding partner. Oh my god. I have
[1287.82s -> 1291.98s]  to show this. I forgot to show this off. So this guy right here, this Suicidal Engineer
[1291.98s -> 1300.22s]  is what his name is. He sent me the ring. Where is it? Where's my diamond ring? Look
[1300.22s -> 1306.49s]  at that. Special something for special someone. So thank you so much. I wanted to really mention
[1306.49s -> 1311.33s]  that. But yes, I will accept this. Yeah, this is like the Team Fortress 2 like Valentine's.
[1311.33s -> 1316.42s]  It's not wedding. It's like Valentine's Day. But yeah. Special shout out to that guy because
[1316.42s -> 1321.99s]  that's really, really thoughtful. So now I've got to accept your gift. I don't even know
[1321.99s -> 1331.38s]  how to do it. Where is it? All right. I accept. Thank you. Thank you so much. Add to my game
[1331.58s -> 1336.58s]  library. I will absolutely play this. Thank you so much. That's all I can say. You're
[1336.58s -> 1343.22s]  awesome. Thank you. Oh, our little Jervish growing up now. Yeah, that's awesome. That's
[1343.22s -> 1354.36s]  not a good way to go. Yeah, I did see the new Grordbord stuff. The new Grordbord. How
[1354.36s -> 1365.94s]  do you even say that? I always say that wrong. Grordbord. Grordbord. Gordbot. Oh my god.
[1365.94s -> 1372.80s]  Every time. Every time I exit spawn. All right. You know what? I'm going. I am going to just
[1372.80s -> 1376.58s]  plant. You know what? No. I'm killing this guy first. Before running away. That works
[1376.58s -> 1385.46s]  as well. Protect this room. Let's at least get some area denial going here. This guy's
[1385.46s -> 1391.83s]  down here. This guy knows I'm here. Where is he? Change it. Right here. Oh what? What?
[1391.83s -> 1402.29s]  That's a big sentry. That is a big sentry. My goodness. No. My god. All right. All right.
[1402.29s -> 1410.96s]  Time to go scout. Time to go scout. I'm going to use. Oh no. Oh that's right. You know what?
[1411.04s -> 1424.79s]  For the sake of my backpack being gone, we're going to go all default. At least item wise.
[1424.79s -> 1437.02s]  You are not real. And you're probably still alive. I can't believe I just did that. I
[1437.02s -> 1441.98s]  can't believe it. I can't believe that just happened. I can't believe I just did that.
[1441.98s -> 1452.38s]  I got behind two people. I want to just go punch myself in the face with like an iron.
[1452.38s -> 1461.67s]  Oh my god. That is really depressing. You know what I mean? It's just like I got behind
[1461.67s -> 1477.47s]  those two guys. That one soldier. And there was a crit. And I missed. There's a spy coming
[1477.47s -> 1490.55s]  up. I need help. He's going to headshot me. This always happens. Why did I just hit E?
[1490.55s -> 1506.70s]  God. This is a spy. Maybe not. Let's bump. No. It's Ari. Hey Ari. That's a bad place
[1506.70s -> 1519.42s]  to go. What? What? What just happened? That guy shot me through the staircase. I am mad.
[1519.42s -> 1528.46s]  All right. I'm putting the milk on. I need my milk. I need my calcium. Calcium for the
[1534.28s -> 1538.48s]  week. If I were to have any unusual effect on a hat or any unusual, I would want the
[1538.48s -> 1544.22s]  what is it? The searing towering pillar of hats. Because that is not worth like five
[1544.22s -> 1548.29s]  million dollars or something. That's like a lot of money. Two soldiers. I can't deal
[1548.29s -> 1558.48s]  with that. And a scout. And I have milk. And I threw it. Oh my goodness gracious. How much
[1558.48s -> 1563.48s]  what? Somebody tell me. What is the most expensive Team Fortress hat? Like in dollars. In U.S.
[1563.48s -> 1568.26s]  dollars. Is it searing towering pillar or a sunlight towering pillar? Is it like two
[1568.26s -> 1577.98s]  thousand dollars or something crazy? What is the approximation? The value of that item?
[1577.98s -> 1593.78s]  Oh boy. I'm in trouble. Someone just has to like burp on me and I'm going to die. Please
[1593.78s -> 1605.25s]  don't burp on me. I don't want to die. There we go. I have played L.A. Noir. Oh. What?
[1605.25s -> 1610.74s]  Oh. That just made me sad what just happened. I'm not even mad about that. I'm just like
[1610.74s -> 1622.22s]  upset. I just want to cry. Game to game. Sunbeam's TC is about 40 buds. So how much is one bud?
[1624.10s -> 1636.34s]  U.S. dollars. Get in there. Did I get him? Get rid of that mini sentry. I can't even
[1636.34s -> 1646.62s]  go over there. I can't even go anywhere. I can't take you anywhere scout. Hi spawn. Bye
[1646.62s -> 1659.26s]  spawn. I can't go over there. God. Oh that's not the right taunt. Wait we failed. Wait
[1659.26s -> 1670.99s]  I thought we were winning. I thought we had the point. Well that's uh. So one bud is 35
[1672.11s -> 1680.90s]  dollars. So that's a lot of money. That is a lot of money. Let's go to. Alright new server.
[1682.53s -> 1686.67s]  Thanks to you guys on this server right now. We're going to trade. Trade servers. Let's
[1686.67s -> 1692.07s]  try and get on a payload. Payload race. No no payload race. I don't like payload race.
[1692.07s -> 1699.42s]  I do but it can be too chaotic. Peel bad water. Too many bots. People won't be able to get
[1699.42s -> 1705.90s]  in so easily. Here we go. Hoodoo. There we go. Absolutely freaking lootly hoodoo. It's
[1705.90s -> 1716.22s]  going in the chat right now. This is the IP. There you are. Ladies and gents. The last
[1716.22s -> 1721.78s]  giveaway winner. I sent him a Twitter message and he still hasn't replied. I'm going to
[1721.94s -> 1730.58s]  shell check right now. That was a long time ago. That was a while ago. So be on the lookout
[1730.58s -> 1734.78s]  in the next week or the next 3 or 4 days. I may be picking another person on Twitter
[1734.78s -> 1749.92s]  for this 33% of this backpack. I want all your items. I'm probably going to play tower
[1749.92s -> 1758.70s]  defense again because that was always fun. Bloons tower defense. Here's the IP again
[1758.70s -> 1765.62s]  for those of you wondering. That is the IP right? Let me make sure. Yes it is. That is
[1765.62s -> 1775.90s]  the IP. Do. I don't think I've really ever done the scope sniper on a stream before so
[1775.90s -> 1782.44s]  you know what? We're going to do it. I need like a hat. I need like a hat. One of these
[1782.44s -> 1791.84s]  like party hats and like sunglasses. Oh yeah. High five. Ship boom. Pro ping right here.
[1791.84s -> 1798.66s]  How much ping? That's not that bad Norman. That's not too terrible. I'd say if you got
[1798.66s -> 1811.34s]  to like 160 or 150 you should start to count your blessings. Oh my god Boo. Yeah Boo sorry
[1811.34s -> 1817.59s]  there's like no Skype call. I was running very very very late. More than an hour late
[1817.59s -> 1828.38s]  to the stream so I had to just go. What is this guy doing? That guy was like standing
[1828.38s -> 1839.04s]  in the creator character position. You know what? This is a bad spot. I'm going to get
[1839.04s -> 1852.35s]  in trouble. Yeah I knew it. That's a bad spot. Late to his own stream as usual. Yeah I do
[1852.35s -> 1859.10s]  frequently. I'm always at least 5-10 minutes late. Hey better late than never though right?
[1859.10s -> 1870.56s]  Isn't that the old adage? Is that even an adage? Oh my cat's in here now going. Let's
[1870.56s -> 1879.00s]  get a couple of headshots huh? There goes the engineer that's in like the creator character
[1879.00s -> 1893.36s]  stance. What? Oh boy. I didn't cover him. My god what a total idiot I am. Stop the
[1893.36s -> 1905.66s]  bloody boom. Ow. Right in my face. Am I going to play Left 4 Dead 2? Probably not on this
[1905.66s -> 1914.22s]  stream tonight but I absolutely love that game so probably at some point yeah. Will you stop
[1914.22s -> 1933.39s]  meowing? You're ruining my stream cat meowing. Oh my god. Hey you look like you could use
[1933.39s -> 1942.58s]  some pee on your back. I'll like throw it right into one of my teammates backs. I just
[1942.58s -> 1952.80s]  puked cat. Oh I got to switch. I got to go heavy. They're going to win. Got to go heavy
[1952.80s -> 1958.52s]  with the brass beast and I'm just going to stand in a corner and just hold down this
[1958.52s -> 1962.32s]  damn button. Come on come on come on come on. Don't let them get it. Don't let them
[1962.32s -> 1974.03s]  get it. No. No I got to get right up on here. Bye. Oh my god I'm going to die. I'm just
[1974.03s -> 1984.20s]  going to eat the sandwich on the cart. Oh my god. Oh yeah. Heavy turtling. What do you
[1984.20s -> 1994.74s]  know about heavy turtles? The two heavy turtles. This is actually going to work. Who needs
[1994.74s -> 2012.12s]  sentry guns when you've got three super heavies? Are these two the same person? Oh hear me.
[2012.12s -> 2023.83s]  Help me. Teenage mutant ninja heavy alien turtles. So I know I asked this before but
[2023.83s -> 2027.55s]  I couldn't see the chat. Is the audio fine? Can you hear me and is the stream too loud
[2027.55s -> 2046.38s]  or are we just right as Goldilocks would say? That's good. That's good. Ha! You cannot
[2046.38s -> 2054.36s]  defeat the heavy. I just bumped into someone for sure. You can always tell when, you know,
[2054.36s -> 2057.88s]  you never know if it's lag or you're actually bumping into someone and that's, I don't want
[2057.88s -> 2067.14s]  to get hit by that again. Oh for the love of all that is sacred. Ditto zero zero zero.
[2067.14s -> 2080.13s]  How are you man? Look at, I love this heavy. Look at this guy. That is a true heavy right
[2080.13s -> 2088.10s]  there. Standing on the cart with sunglasses, a luchador mask and a Russian hat on. What
[2088.10s -> 2099.73s]  a goofy goofy person. I love him. Oh my goodness. Oh I have on the Brass Beast. Can't move.
[2099.73s -> 2107.41s]  Must punch someone in face. Nope not going to happen. I heard a backstab. I'm so scared
[2107.41s -> 2117.90s]  right now. That is the worst part about the Brass Beast. If you get ubered and there's
[2117.90s -> 2124.90s]  people like 50-100 feet away from you, it's all over. Because by the time you run up there,
[2125.14s -> 2134.45s]  it's just like, oh everyone just turn around the corner and run away. I'm sorry. You know,
[2134.45s -> 2150.30s]  we could use, I don't know what I want to do. Pyro. Saddled him. Going pyro. Best guerrilla
[2150.30s -> 2154.54s]  song is absolutely stylo. Either stylo, oh you know what, this is going to sound weird
[2154.54s -> 2166.74s]  but I actually like dare. For use of that song. I do know the lyrics of the song but
[2166.74s -> 2174.21s]  they're very odd. Oh pyro on pyro fight. That's, you are not real. That's not me. I didn't
[2174.21s -> 2182.74s]  just look in a mirror. That wasn't me. Bumping into somebody. Watch your backs. Oh he turned
[2182.74s -> 2194.36s]  and just smoked me. I started listening to the guerrillas because well they are a great
[2194.36s -> 2205.54s]  band. I'm glad you got to listen to them because they're awesome. My cat right now is just
[2205.54s -> 2212.48s]  sitting underneath, literally just sitting underneath my legs. Just rubbing up against
[2212.48s -> 2216.24s]  my legs over and over again and I just want to be like cat get out of here but I can't
[2216.24s -> 2245.53s]  because he's too cute. Die. Die. How much health do you have? Kill me. Oh we found
[2245.53s -> 2265.66s]  him. We got a winner. We got a winner. Come here. Come here. Watch out. No. No. Stay alive.
[2265.66s -> 2277.92s]  I need, I'm going to run out of ammo. Oh shoot me. Shoot me. Shoot me. Oh that would have
[2277.92s -> 2288.14s]  been a crit. Get him. Oh my god. What just happened? Somebody look at the, look what
[2288.14s -> 2295.92s]  just happened. What just even happened right there guys? I, what did I reflect? I tried
[2295.92s -> 2303.88s]  to put the heavy that was on fire. What even just happened? That was very very odd. Maybe
[2303.88s -> 2312.97s]  I reflected a, I'm so confused. Oh let me like put this heavy out and hear like the
[2312.97s -> 2319.24s]  crit noise and then kill somebody. Like what? So if that was you that I just killed I have
[2319.24s -> 2339.64s]  no idea how it happened. Whoa. Oh he's a sniper. Damn. Whoa hold on. Stop freaking out here.
[2339.64s -> 2353.25s]  Gotcha. Back the car. No. Back the car. Oh my god they're going to win. Oh sup burger.
[2354.98s -> 2358.38s]  Sup burger boy. You got to like, are you raging yet? Are you on, oh you're on this. No you're
[2358.38s -> 2363.70s]  on the other team. Burger boy why are you not like freaking out right now? No. No. No.
[2363.70s -> 2375.57s]  Trying to put people out. Oh man. Nice team Uber. Nice team Uber Ari. Oh here it comes.
[2375.57s -> 2385.46s]  Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I'm upset. I'm going medic. I thought for sure I was going
[2385.46s -> 2395.72s]  to time that but he had the direct hit. He got killed by Herp and Dirk. At the same time
[2395.72s -> 2403.40s]  they both killed me. Where is grandpa? Did you see my latest vlog talking about that?
[2403.40s -> 2412.63s]  Oh my god. Spies everywhere. In my latest vlog I talk about grandpa. Oh my god they're
[2412.63s -> 2428.21s]  behind us. No don't die. Just, I'm going to sit down here. No I'm not. Oh god. Oh my
[2428.21s -> 2434.54s]  god. I was so concerned about getting shot from behind from people on the cart but I,
[2434.54s -> 2445.26s]  oh we won. There we go. I do want to play Grand Theft Auto on a stream. I really do.
[2445.26s -> 2450.66s]  It's just the only problem with Grand Theft Auto is it's very poorly optimized on the
[2450.66s -> 2456.57s]  PC so it can be very difficult to even record that game. So it's something I would have
[2456.57s -> 2461.93s]  to look into trying to make it run at a little bit lower settings maybe because that game
[2461.93s -> 2470.12s]  takes almost like 5,000% like CPU when you try and play it on like good settings. Now
[2470.12s -> 2474.65s]  this will be the last round in this server and we're going to go somewhere else. Oh look
[2474.65s -> 2482.99s]  at you. You match. Don't you just look so beautiful. Alright here we go. Ship bank.
[2482.99s -> 2494.65s]  Oh look my spray. My spray's cold. Who wants this? Who's getting this? I don't know yet.
[2494.65s -> 2499.37s]  You're all good players. I don't know who's going to get it. I guess the person that I
[2499.41s -> 2508.98s]  do it to is the person that's going to get it. So be on the lookout. No trades. Not right
[2508.98s -> 2516.58s]  now. Look at what you guys are doing. And why is everybody pink? Everybody's like, we're
[2516.58s -> 2527.62s]  about to go like driving Miss Daisy. And do it. Demo spam everywhere. What is happening?
[2529.29s -> 2540.66s]  Oh my god. Am I excited for Borderlands 2? Yeah I guess. Borderlands 1 I was, I had a
[2542.02s -> 2546.00s]  good time with it. But I don't know. You have to really play that game with other people.
[2546.00s -> 2551.49s]  You can't really play that game alone. It's too, it's just not my type of game to play
[2551.49s -> 2558.95s]  by myself. But I would probably play it with other people for sure and make videos. Absolutely.
[2558.95s -> 2564.34s]  Is there a spy for sure? Like look at this crowd of people. There's got to be a spy stuck
[2564.34s -> 2571.59s]  somewhere in here. Oh my god where are you? I need to heal you. I just saw him. Come here.
[2571.59s -> 2578.87s]  Come here. Come here. Oh. Hey at least I did that right? At least I said, at least I avenged
[2578.87s -> 2588.74s]  you. Oh Ari are you ready? Boom. Crits everywhere. Probably should have saved that but you know,
[2588.74s -> 2601.91s]  oh my god. No, no. Get out of here. Oh I backed up right into a knife. Right into a knife.
[2601.91s -> 2608.45s]  I'm going to spell out what I want to say but I'm not going to say it. S-H-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-T.
[2608.45s -> 2613.89s]  And then as many exclamation points you can put on the end of that sentence. That's how
[2613.89s -> 2630.87s]  I feel right now. I got you. I got you. Put that away. Let me heal you. Final push. Oh
[2630.87s -> 2634.51s]  wouldn't it be great to be on defense right now with a critscreek as a demo man and kill
[2634.51s -> 2641.35s]  every single person standing right here. My goodness. I think we're going to get it. Let's
[2641.35s -> 2651.56s]  try and get these people to stay and heal. That's one way. Alright nice job guys. Crit
[2651.56s -> 2658.56s]  needles. Oh my god. They just respawned. Oh my god. You want to talk about a way to burn
[2661.74s -> 2667.38s]  out a hard drive? A graphics card? Oh my god. Speaking of that, let me make sure I'm not
[2667.38s -> 2680.41s]  going to explode here. I say this every time. No I'm good. We're good to go. Alright changing
[2680.41s -> 2695.32s]  servers one more time. Disconnect. Browse servers. Refresh. Favorite classes engineer
[2695.32s -> 2701.94s]  then probably huntsman sniper. I don't know. I change it. My mind changes on a daily basis
[2701.94s -> 2711.98s]  so it's hard to say what my favorite class is. Let's go to a... We can always go to good
[2711.98s -> 2719.86s]  old gravel pit. Gravel pit for sure. Play a couple more rounds on here. There's the
[2719.86s -> 2734.58s]  IP. Oh there's decals. Maybe it's going to be cool looking. Maybe. Maybe. The reason
[2734.58s -> 2740.46s]  why I don't accept trade requests during streams is because I like to keep the action as high
[2740.46s -> 2745.62s]  as I can keep it. I'm sure people don't want to... Oh I'm going to trade. What am I going
[2745.62s -> 2749.69s]  to get? Let's do some trading. I guess maybe that could be entertaining to some people
[2749.69s -> 2760.79s]  but I like to keep the action flowing. I'll go blue this time. And I'm going to play with
[2761.79s -> 2768.73s]  my revolver. My spicycle. I just got this. I might as well use these things. Totally
[2768.73s -> 2783.87s]  strange brain. I don't have a strange sapper. Too bad. Too bad. Medic! Doctor! Medic! Doctor!
[2786.89s -> 2794.16s]  Doctor! Alright that's enough of that. Wait a second. I thought I was waiting for set
[2794.16s -> 2800.90s]  up time. Apparently there's no... Okay. It's just happening. Oh I'm looking at the chat
[2800.90s -> 2810.20s]  right now. I'm not even looking at my screen. I just tried to give it. That's weird. Okay
[2810.36s -> 2819.06s]  so the chat just screwed up. Can anyone see what I just wrote by the way? Can you guys
[2819.06s -> 2831.58s]  see the IP? Because apparently it's Twitch. What are you saying Burger Boy? Oh Burger
[2831.58s -> 2841.10s]  Boy. Blue's capture. I'm so confused right now. I think I'm playing. I don't know why
[2841.10s -> 2852.52s]  I think I'm red. I'm looking at the chat. Oh my goodness. Pull out the dead burger.
[2852.52s -> 2862.86s]  I don't have it. I do have it. Hey I'm a scout. Don't shoot me. Oh no. Oh god. Oh god. Oh
[2870.32s -> 2888.95s]  god. Run. Oh no. Please. Oh. So did you guys hear my idea for a spy video? I think I said
[2888.95s -> 2900.18s]  it last stream. Oh my god. Oh my god. That is... That is a... If you've never seen that
[2900.58s -> 2912.35s]  spray before that is Burger Boy spray. And he is a disgusting human being. God dang it.
[2912.35s -> 2923.96s]  I'm in trouble. Hey. I'll just go this way then. Instant respawn. My goodness. I think
[2923.96s -> 2932.96s]  we're about to win. Alright let's get like a new round started so I'm not so confused.
[2932.96s -> 2939.70s]  I don't want to be confused. I don't want to fall asleep cause I... That's two songs
[2939.70s -> 2949.95s]  combined in one. I'll miss you babe. And I don't want to miss a thing. Cause even when
[2949.95s -> 2961.69s]  I... Oh my god. Come on. My hands are in my face right now. I really thought I was going
[2961.93s -> 2969.46s]  to get that stair step. I really thought I was going to get it. And it didn't happen.
[2969.46s -> 2978.25s]  And I crouched in everything. I did. I crouched. I did crouch. Oh you're going to taunt? Are
[2978.25s -> 2990.14s]  you ready to get head shot? He's going to get away. Oh. Just running right into people
[2990.14s -> 3015.64s]  again. Oh my god. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm just going to be like the tank. Yeah heal
[3015.64s -> 3023.26s]  me. Spy's not working right now. I'm not playing spy anymore. When I... A lot of you guys know
[3023.26s -> 3028.43s]  this. I've said this before. Playing spy on a live stream is like pulling teeth out of
[3028.43s -> 3033.96s]  my brain. Like when I play spy I need 100% concentration. And if I don't have that it's
[3033.96s -> 3051.85s]  like I am essentially regressed to being like 9 years old. Oh dat live com. Oh my goodness.
[3051.85s -> 3061.10s]  Did they even have... Okay that didn't hit anybody. Oh my god. Bottle. Attack of the
[3061.10s -> 3075.99s]  bottle. Oh. Kroba. Kroba is my best friend on this team. Because his name is Kroba. And
[3076.88s -> 3102.76s]  I can say it. Walking lord. You want to go bottle? You want to go with the bottle? He's
[3106.62s -> 3114.84s]  gone. He's gone. Don't worry we got it. We got it. We're good. Where is it? Is there
[3114.84s -> 3124.40s]  something up there? There's nothing up here. Except this one dude. Oh. I'm like a hippie.
[3124.40s -> 3139.96s]  Rocket. Woohoo. Flying demo man. Here we go. Boink. Oh yeah. You know I'm going to take
[3142.94s -> 3150.67s]  this off. I'm going to put on the weed booties. And the frying pan. We're going to go sticky
[3150.67s -> 3164.58s]  tank. Sticky tank. Sticky tank. Worst item in the game? Oolipool caper. In my opinion.
[3164.62s -> 3171.15s]  I do not like that thing. I think it's just a dumb weapon. I don't know. I never use it.
[3171.15s -> 3177.30s]  And I think it's just a suicide weapon in my opinion. Which there's not something terribly
[3177.30s -> 3185.22s]  wrong with that. I build your uber for you. Look. Oh I missed the high five. I'm sorry.
[3185.22s -> 3189.72s]  Alright. Ready. Place your bets. How many people are going to watch the stream right
[3189.72s -> 3199.59s]  now and see what I'm doing and just not open this door? I bet every single person is not
[3199.67s -> 3212.28s]  here right now. Except for this one dude who might die. No. Oh I just waited one more second.
[3212.28s -> 3235.86s]  Sticky tank. They're all going. Hey. Get over here. Oh he's not dead. Oh for the love of
[3235.86s -> 3246.35s]  goodness gracious. Oh my god. Get rid of this guy. Blowing us all around like pot pockets.
[3246.35s -> 3263.29s]  That analogy did not make very much sense. Now did it? I wonder what that looked like
[3263.29s -> 3270.97s]  on his screen. That must have been so funny. He must have saw that. What? What? Oh he's
[3271.05s -> 3300.74s]  up there. Oh my god dude. Oh that was so funny. Defend the point. Oh another lucky crit. I'm
[3301.70s -> 3311.81s]  sorry about that. I backed into another knife. Gosh darn it. With a capital D. Is the chat
[3311.81s -> 3320.17s]  slow for anybody? I can't see anything. There we go. Absa-positive elutely my friend. Towering
[3320.17s -> 3335.37s]  pillar of hats. Two dudes with it. Except I'm not going to have it for very long. Oh
[3335.37s -> 3344.58s]  my god you are a spy. He's still alive. How many does it take? I do play in windowed mode.
[3344.58s -> 3357.58s]  I have to. Just stream it. How much health does he have? He must have a bunch of heads.
[3357.58s -> 3370.02s]  I don't trust you. I don't trust you you snake. Oh don't you back up into that. I can't believe
[3370.02s -> 3383.27s]  I didn't hit him. I am so shocked and appalled. Oh my god. There he is. Why? I thought we
[3383.27s -> 3389.78s]  got rid of him. I thought somebody killed him. How many spies are on that team? One
[3389.78s -> 3406.82s]  two three four three. Yeah I'm not doing too well either so don't worry. I'm on that guy's
[3407.82s -> 3422.95s]  head. I'm scared. If I was standing that would have been so cool. Of course I put the crit
[3422.95s -> 3431.34s]  down right in front of my face. Is that guy still up here? I think he is. Oh yeah he is.
[3431.34s -> 3439.92s]  I found him. Alright no more demo man. Not doing hot with him. Let's go back to Pyro.
[3439.92s -> 3456.53s]  Do reserve shooter. Come here let me put you out. Engineer. Dude I'm just the designated
[3456.53s -> 3474.43s]  putter router people of person. God let me reload. Good good good. Oh god crit screak.
[3474.43s -> 3482.00s]  I don't know if you want to give it to me. Might be a total failure. Oh my god how-

[3497.78s -> 3510.46s]  in this damn thing. What's my opinion on the royal wedding? That's cool I guess. People
[3510.46s -> 3518.17s]  getting married. It's whales right? Prince I think I could be totally wrong. Boo don't
[3518.17s -> 3523.56s]  be mad at me if I don't know that answer. Of course if you don't know Boo, BooMan61 is
[3523.56s -> 3531.83s]  a Eastman. No that's a little bit of a- I'm trying to think of the word. Trivia. I'm sure
[3532.15s -> 3543.52s]  everyone knows that anyways. Oh jeez. That guy did a double jump. Oh yeah. Let me get
[3543.52s -> 3554.53s]  stuck on the wall. Lagging very badly. I'm sorry. I apologize for the lag dude. I'm sorry.
[3554.53s -> 3572.60s]  Let's go this way. Yeah it's true. Oh come on. I have new items. What? I haven't died
[3572.60s -> 3583.63s]  yet. I got a feeling that there's a lot of people trying to- What even killed him on
[3583.63s -> 3595.04s]  the century? Mini century. It wasn't just a century it was a gosh dang mini century.
[3598.44s -> 3616.09s]  Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy. Oh no no. Oh come on kill everybody. Oh at least I got two
[3616.09s -> 3622.48s]  or three people. Brass beast. Two and two on this guy. I haven't seen this guy in a
[3622.48s -> 3630.45s]  little while. This guy las. The chat is not loading for me so if you- What the hell? What
[3630.45s -> 3638.21s]  the- Well that's one way to die. Yeah the chat is not loading. What the hell is going
[3638.21s -> 3653.83s]  on here? Chat bastard. Cat. Stop yelp cat. Do I speak English? It depends on if I'm playing
[3654.47s -> 3658.87s]  a game and talking. At that point probably not. Probably speaking some other language
[3658.87s -> 3668.74s]  and nobody knows. I don't know how I didn't hit him in the first one. Will you be quiet
[3668.74s -> 3695.60s]  cat? You're messing with my feng shui. Or is that spy? Oh die. Oh god there's people
[3695.60s -> 3708.74s]  everywhere. Oh right into- Walked right into him. Favorite movie is probably- Now that
[3708.74s -> 3713.57s]  is a tough question because then you have to talk about The Dark Knight, Memento, Ghostbusters.
[3713.57s -> 3720.58s]  I cannot pick a favorite movie. No way. Even if I tried. Even if I really wanted to tell
[3720.58s -> 3738.70s]  you. Get him in the air. This guy's getting unusual. He means business. Oh let's go. Let's
[3738.70s -> 3745.18s]  rock out. I don't even care anymore. I'm just running into like an idiot. Fight Club is
[3745.18s -> 3751.94s]  also an amazing one. Ghostbusters. You never seen Ghostbusters before? If you've never
[3751.94s -> 3758.42s]  seen Ghostbusters, go. Go. Go do it right now. Go. Go to Netflix dot- I mean isn't even
[3758.42s -> 3783.96s]  on Netflix? I don't even know. Eight damage. Hitting me. There you go. Oh if I had a shot.
[3783.96s -> 3796.06s]  If I had a damn shot. There's how you shoot somebody in the face. How come I didn't hit
[3796.06s -> 3802.90s]  anybody? I didn't get a crit with that? Actually maybe I did. Probably just didn't show up.
[3802.90s -> 3813.89s]  Two minutes left. Hello spy. You happen to be in the base. Red spy in the base. Blue
[3813.89s -> 3833.66s]  spy in the base. Actually. Make sure no Rapscallions are coming up behind us. Damn it. What? How
[3833.66s -> 3842.08s]  did that not hit that dude? Just barely killed him. No. Stay away from my medic. I'm trying
[3842.08s -> 3862.03s]  to keep him away from you. No. I'm going to have to catch him off guard. For sure. Oh
[3862.03s -> 3876.18s]  he was just- Oh my goodness. How is he not going to die from that? I was going to say.
[3876.18s -> 3888.11s]  Oh get up in the air again. I'm sorry. I can't protect you. No. Leave my spedic alone. Watch
[3888.11s -> 3899.66s]  yourself. I don't have any air blast left. Retreat. Retreat. Crit to the face. I think
[3899.66s -> 3909.72s]  we're going to get it guys. See if any craziness happens at the very end. Oh don't jump. Probably
[3909.72s -> 3917.12s]  be a good idea to- Oh my god. That guy came out of nowhere. Might as well sit on the point
[3917.12s -> 3924.74s]  and just do this. And just air blast anyone that tries to jump up here. Nice game guys.
[3928.13s -> 3936.81s]  Oh. Alright. So I think I'm going to transition now to play some Bloons Tower defense. I'm
[3939.77s -> 3946.92s]  going to play until I die. Well hopefully I do. I'm going to go one more life. So if
[3946.92s -> 3957.56s]  I- Next time I die. My last life. I've been streaming TF2 for about an hour and ten minutes.
[3957.56s -> 3975.88s]  Just about an hour. A full sixty minutes. Yeah Bloons is fun man. Ten hour games by
[3975.88s -> 3989.58s]  play. Is Bloons 5 out? Can I play that? I've never had Bloons from my iPhone. I've got
[3989.58s -> 3993.99s]  to do that. My god. Alright so if you want to keep playing Team Fortress the only way
[3993.99s -> 3998.94s]  it's going to happen is if there's like nine medics on me. You know what? Let's do it.
[3998.94s -> 4005.98s]  Let's do it. Everyone on blue go medic. We'll see how long this lasts. If you are on blue
[4005.98s -> 4014.06s]  just go medic. And just octo heavy me. I wonder how long I will stay alive. This is the last
[4014.06s -> 4025.97s]  life. Here we go. Oh my god. Oh this is an immediately rigged fight. Is it even like
[4025.97s -> 4036.46s]  possible to die? I don't even think it's possible to die. Oh my god. Oh my god. Unless I get
[4036.46s -> 4052.77s]  backstabbed. There's no way I'm going to die. It just hurts to laugh. Oh what a bunch of
[4052.77s -> 4070.29s]  nonsense. Oh my- No don't kill my medics I need them. Oh no we lost quite a few. Oh no.
[4076.06s -> 4084.66s]  Oh I'm going to like pass out man. I just like laughed too hard. Oh my face hurts. We really-
[4084.66s -> 4091.44s]  No there's no way this is going to work. There's no way this is going to work. If this actually
[4091.44s -> 4101.36s]  works no way. No my battalion. I'm going to get backstabbed. It's going to end it. The
[4101.36s -> 4112.37s]  backstab's going to end it all. No don't kill me. Oh my god they're all going spy. They are
[4112.37s -> 4130.66s]  all going spy. Everybody went spy. No no no no no. Oh well you did it and I think we won.
[4130.66s -> 4137.01s]  Did we win? Did we just win the game right there? Oh come on we gotta win. We gotta win.
[4137.01s -> 4151.81s]  I'm going again. All right this is it. This is it. Is it possible? Is it possible? I thought
[4151.81s -> 4155.14s]  we were going to do it in one life. That would have been ridiculous. That would have just been
[4155.22s -> 4162.99s]  like a joke. Such a total nonsense. Careful for spies. There's a spy back here somewhere.
[4162.99s -> 4174.18s]  Look at all those stickies. That's all right. I am octo- Oh that's it. That's it. I'm dead.
[4174.18s -> 4181.89s]  I said it was going to be one life. Turn it into two and third time's a charm baby. Let's do it
[4181.89s -> 4193.14s]  one more time. After this I'm going to play one round of bloons. This is it. This is the real-
[4193.14s -> 4203.04s]  This is it. This is really it. If I die right here I am rage quitting. Careful. I'm not supposed to
[4203.04s -> 4215.34s]  keep my back turned. There's definitely somebody's hiding in this room. This is chaos. This is
[4215.34s -> 4220.88s]  absolute total chaos. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Jump down. All the medics
[4220.88s -> 4227.38s]  jump down. Watch out for the spy medic. This is spy medic. Oh my god he's killing everyone.
[4227.38s -> 4233.73s]  Oh my god. He's killing. Oh my god they were all spies. Oh my god how many people.
[4238.66s -> 4244.85s]  How many of those medics were actually spies is the real question. All right that's uh that's
[4244.85s -> 4255.78s]  going to be it. Oh I didn't get it in three. Oh meow yourself. All right guys. Oh my goodness. My
[4255.78s -> 4261.46s]  throat hurts from just like cackling for the last 10 minutes. This time because I'm going to give
[4261.46s -> 4268.38s]  this a little bit of time. I want to really get a tactic down because usually I end the stream
[4268.38s -> 4274.82s]  with this and I'm probably going to end the stream with this as well but I want to get a tactic down.
[4274.82s -> 4288.24s]  A real tactic. So let's see. So the the actual tactic is you're supposed to do it's- somebody
[4288.24s -> 4295.15s]  gave me a tactic before and they said you have to do- you have to raise your right leg and then
[4295.15s -> 4301.81s]  raise your left leg but you don't raise the calf. Like that. Like that. Like that. Oh my god come on.
[4301.81s -> 4308.69s]  This is the first time I've ever stepped more than two steps in this game. So the goal tonight guys
[4308.69s -> 4321.60s]  is- what was that? The goal tonight is 50 meters. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna get to 50. You don't
[4321.60s -> 4330.90s]  believe me? Just watch. 50 meters right now. Once I get to 50 I can end the stream. 50 meters. Come
[4330.90s -> 4337.70s]  on. Come on. Slug your way over there you bastard. 50 meters. We're doing it. I'm doing it. I don't
[4337.70s -> 4344.24s]  care if it takes me till eight in the morning. I'm doing 50 meters or at least 40. We'll say 40.
[4344.24s -> 4356.61s]  At least 40 meters or I have- oh my god. I'm okay. We're good. We're good. Gotta get to at least 40.
[4356.61s -> 4362.59s]  Here we go baby. Come on. We're doing the niche. We're doing the niche stride. We're doing the knee
[4362.59s -> 4370.08s]  slug. Imagine how bad that would hurt. Can you imagine how awful that would hurt? I seem to be
[4370.08s -> 4378.69s]  stuck here. I'm stuck. Oh my god. There we go. What you- there we go. There we go. Come on. Keep- stay
[4378.69s -> 4387.20s]  with it. Stay with it now. Gotta get to 30 or 40. Oh my god. This is the best I've ever done. All right.
[4387.20s -> 4397.09s]  All right. Slow down. Slow down a little. Slow down a little. We're gonna hit 30. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[4397.09s -> 4404.94s]  Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Oh dude.
[4409.97s -> 4416.86s]  Oh when I say 40, when I said 30 or 40. Let's try and get it again. Oh god damn it. I'm so mad right
[4416.86s -> 4431.55s]  now. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I am so, so mad right now. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug.
[4431.55s -> 4438.22s]  I'm gonna get to 40 with the slug. Just you see. So now that we got a little slug going here,
[4438.22s -> 4447.17s]  let's talk about a story. So one time there was a slug named Jerma and the slug was- I can't even
[4447.17s -> 4462.18s]  talk because I'm like balancing on one foot. All right. Transition here. No. All right. 30 plus 10
[4462.18s -> 4471.36s]  is 40. I did it. I just gotta get down. I gotta get down on like the ground. I gotta have this like-
[4471.36s -> 4478.62s]  I gotta get- I had it down the first time and you know what? I screwed it all up. 30 plus 10 is 40.
[4478.62s -> 4494.51s]  I did it. There we go. There we go. Nice workout I'm doing here, huh? Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug. Slug.
[4494.51s -> 4502.72s]  Slug. Slug. All right. We're at 10. I've made it to a combined- a combined 50 meters. Can I make it
[4502.72s -> 4513.90s]  to 40 doing this? I don't think it's gonna happen. I really don't think it's gonna happen. Oh don't
[4513.90s -> 4522.11s]  lose it. All right. 30 plus 10 plus 13 is more than 50. I did it. I made it.
[4522.11s -> 4538.29s]  Do-do-do-do-do. Do-do-do-do-do. Apparently I can walk up sideways. There we go. Just gotta keep this
[4538.29s -> 4545.57s]  rhythm. I'm gonna keep the rhythm. Boom. Do-do-do-do. Slug. Slug. We're gonna slug. Slug. Everybody's
[4545.57s -> 4552.69s]  gotta slug. We're gonna slug. Slug. Every day. You gotta slug till it's told till the end of May.
[4552.69s -> 4568.24s]  You gotta slug. Slug. The music helps. The music helps. The music helps.
[4574.50s -> 4579.52s]  Why did I stop singing? The music helped. Let's do it again. This is the last time. Here we go.
[4588.56s -> 4603.44s]  Do-do-do-do-do. Slug. We gotta slug here. I've never seen such a slug in my entire life.
[4605.04s -> 4610.24s]  When you slug, you gotta slug. When you go, you go. You gotta get on the track and be
[4610.24s -> 4623.76s]  super slow. You got it. The music. The music. Never, never don't slug. Never stop slugging
[4623.76s -> 4640.93s]  till you get to the end of town. Oh, I think that was a combined over 100 meters. Well, there we go.
[4640.93s -> 4653.41s]  Well, that's gonna be it. I've drained all my energy with this co-op. At least I got 30 meters.
[4653.41s -> 4658.34s]  I said 30 or 40 in one try. Actually, I said 40 or 50, but I'm gonna change my words.
[4658.34s -> 4664.48s]  I'm gonna be like a politician and say, well, I actually said 30 or 40. But yeah, that was fun.
[4664.48s -> 4670.24s]  That was fun. So everybody, thank you so much for coming. This is the end of the stream.
[4671.76s -> 4678.78s]  I need to go drink some tea. My throat is a little dry and itchy. But anyways, guys,
[4678.78s -> 4684.86s]  thank you so, so much for coming. All you guys that stuck around means a lot. You guys rock.
[4684.86s -> 4690.38s]  Stay tuned. I'm gonna hope this will all be uploaded to YouTube. At least this part.
[4690.38s -> 4694.62s]  I'll make sure to get the TF2 and at least the co-op part uploaded to YouTube.
[4695.42s -> 4704.19s]  Be on the lookout for that. Probably tomorrow. Tomorrow in the afternoon, I would assume.
[4704.19s -> 4709.07s]  But the chat, I cannot. The chat just died for me right at the end here. So I'm sorry if I can't
[4709.07s -> 4713.38s]  see anything that you guys are saying. But thank you so much, guys. And I'll catch you guys all
[4713.38s -> 4717.07s]  later. Take care, everybody.
