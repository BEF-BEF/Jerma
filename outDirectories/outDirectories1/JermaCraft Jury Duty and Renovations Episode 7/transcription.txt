[1.40s -> 7.28s]  Alrighty, so let's get rid of this disgusting, horrible floor.
[7.28s -> 10.91s]  Do I even have a shovel?
[10.91s -> 15.65s]  I got a crappy stone shovel.
[15.65s -> 19.91s]  Let's go down one more so I can...
[19.91s -> 21.91s]  Oh god, I forgot I did that.
[21.91s -> 24.09s]  It's okay, it's okay.
[24.09s -> 27.57s]  We are going to look top shelf in no time.
[27.57s -> 28.57s]  Look at this.
[28.57s -> 30.57s]  Oh my goodness.
[30.57s -> 35.37s]  Looks good, looks good.
[35.37s -> 42.27s]  So now my house will not look like a prison cell.
[42.27s -> 46.51s]  Actually prison cells are not typically on dirt.
[46.51s -> 49.94s]  At least in this country, at least in the United States.
[49.94s -> 52.63s]  Prison cells are... ah, damn it.
[52.63s -> 54.83s]  Oh well.
[54.83s -> 57.07s]  I'm not even going to have enough.
[57.07s -> 59.07s]  I've got a bunch of trees and everything.
[59.07s -> 62.07s]  At least it'll be enough to get half the house.
[62.07s -> 68.69s]  So I have jury duty tomorrow.
[68.69s -> 75.00s]  If any of you know what jury duty is, it's not a fun thing.
[75.00s -> 77.00s]  So for those of you that are younger,
[77.00s -> 80.00s]  or for those of you that are not from the United States,
[80.00s -> 82.00s]  jury duty essentially is...
[82.00s -> 84.00s]  Okay, somebody gets in trouble, right?
[84.00s -> 86.00s]  Somebody breaks the law.
[86.00s -> 89.00s]  Somebody like, let's say like Steve Dickinson
[89.00s -> 92.00s]  throws a rock through Mary J. Stevenson's window.
[92.00s -> 95.67s]  So he gets arrested and they put him on trial.
[95.67s -> 99.67s]  And what has to happen is there has to be a jury of his peers.
[99.67s -> 103.67s]  So there has to be a jury of people that are not lawbreakers
[103.67s -> 105.67s]  that are sitting on the jury.
[105.67s -> 107.67s]  They don't have to be non-lawbreakers,
[107.67s -> 111.98s]  but they have to at least be sane individuals.
[111.98s -> 114.11s]  So I got a call.
[114.11s -> 116.11s]  I got a thing in the mail that says,
[116.11s -> 119.48s]  hey, you're one of these people that needs to be on the jury.
[119.48s -> 121.48s]  And what we have to do is determine
[121.48s -> 127.28s]  if the guy that threw the rock through the window is actually guilty.
[127.28s -> 129.28s]  And sometimes it can last a long time.
[129.28s -> 132.65s]  Sometimes you have to come back multiple days.
[132.65s -> 135.89s]  And it really, really, really stinks.
[135.89s -> 137.89s]  I really don't want to do it.
[137.89s -> 141.26s]  But it's against the law to not do it.
[141.26s -> 144.26s]  So if I don't do it, let's say I just don't go tomorrow,
[144.26s -> 145.43s]  I'll get arrested.
[145.43s -> 151.08s]  They will literally come to my house and arrest the crap out of me.
[151.08s -> 154.54s]  But that's what I'm doing tomorrow.
[154.54s -> 156.54s]  If any of you have ever had to do jury duty,
[156.54s -> 158.84s]  I'd like to know about your experience,
[158.84s -> 161.84s]  if you're old enough, because I'm pretty certain
[161.84s -> 163.84s]  you have to be at least 18 to...
[163.84s -> 168.59s]  You have to be at least 18 to be allowed to be a juror.
[168.59s -> 173.30s]  So let me know what experience you had.
[173.30s -> 174.30s]  If any at all.
[174.30s -> 177.80s]  Now I'm going to go back and get those trees that I missed before.
[177.80s -> 179.94s]  Oh, look at that.
[179.94s -> 181.94s]  The sun is setting.
[181.94s -> 184.30s]  What a perfect time to leave the house.
[184.30s -> 187.38s]  And I still haven't made a bed.
[187.38s -> 188.38s]  Oh, my God.
[188.38s -> 190.38s]  I have enough wool, right?
[190.38s -> 193.68s]  That is priority numero uno when I get back,
[193.68s -> 196.05s]  is to make a damn bed.
[196.05s -> 199.27s]  This is not a good idea.
[199.27s -> 203.45s]  I probably should just turn back and make a bed.
[203.45s -> 206.14s]  That's what I'm going to do.
[206.14s -> 211.19s]  All right, give me this wood.
[211.19s -> 215.07s]  A couple of pieces is all it's going to take.
[215.07s -> 218.57s]  Three pieces to be exact.
[218.57s -> 224.28s]  All right, let's make this my floating work benches.
[224.28s -> 227.54s]  It's like this, right?
[227.54s -> 228.54s]  I believe it is.
[228.54s -> 230.54s]  It doesn't matter what wool you use.
[230.54s -> 232.72s]  Excellent.
[232.72s -> 234.72s]  Okay, so here's my bedroom over here.
[234.72s -> 238.28s]  This is going to be the sleeping quarters.
[238.28s -> 240.28s]  Right there.
[240.28s -> 243.28s]  All right, so now I have a spawn point,
[243.28s -> 244.28s]  and I have a place where I...
[244.28s -> 245.28s]  Okay, this is great.
[245.28s -> 246.28s]  This is fantastic.
[246.28s -> 249.28s]  I am very, very happy about this.
[249.28s -> 254.42s]  So let's skip this stupid nighttime business.
[254.42s -> 257.17s]  Monsters can't get through sand, right?
[257.17s -> 258.41s]  I hope not.
[258.41s -> 261.38s]  Any holes?
[261.38s -> 263.38s]  Do I have any holes in my house?
[263.38s -> 265.38s]  I will just get woken up and get murdered.
[265.38s -> 266.94s]  All right.
[266.94s -> 267.94s]  Good night.
[267.94s -> 268.94s]  Good morrow.
[268.94s -> 270.94s]  I will see you all tomorrow, everyone.
[270.94s -> 273.11s]  Good night.
[273.11s -> 275.11s]  Do, do, do, do, do.
[275.11s -> 277.11s]  Oh, well, that was quick.
[277.11s -> 278.67s]  What?
[278.67s -> 279.67s]  Speed sleep.
[279.67s -> 280.67s]  Minecraft.
[280.67s -> 285.94s]  You know, I'm going to fix a couple of things first and foremost.
[285.94s -> 289.56s]  I want to make my house a little nicer looking.
[289.56s -> 294.66s]  I don't want to have it be this jagged mess
[294.66s -> 297.96s]  of, like, sharp objects pointing out.
[297.96s -> 301.06s]  Get rid of this.
[301.06s -> 304.19s]  Get rid of these.
[304.19s -> 306.19s]  They're just eyesores.
[306.19s -> 312.57s]  Not going to have any of that on Jerma's castle.
[312.57s -> 320.18s]  Close this up after I do this, of course.
[320.18s -> 321.94s]  Where's the cobblestone?
[321.94s -> 322.94s]  There it is.
[322.94s -> 323.94s]  All right.
[323.94s -> 324.94s]  Cobblestone.
[324.94s -> 326.18s]  Where's the wall?
[326.18s -> 328.25s]  There it is.
[328.25s -> 330.64s]  Okay.
[330.64s -> 332.88s]  So it needs to go over here.
[332.88s -> 334.88s]  Right there, right there, right there, right there.
[334.88s -> 336.88s]  Didn't I just delete all that?
[336.88s -> 338.25s]  Oh, well.
[338.25s -> 340.25s]  At least it doesn't look like a complete mess.
[340.25s -> 343.47s]  There we go.
[343.47s -> 346.67s]  Knock you out of the way.
[346.67s -> 354.56s]  So I have a actual wall rather than a mess of crap.
[354.56s -> 356.31s]  Okay.
[356.31s -> 357.31s]  Oh, well, look at this.
[357.31s -> 358.31s]  Look at this.
[358.31s -> 362.31s]  Get the wood off of the edge of this house
[362.31s -> 363.31s]  and replace it with a stone
[363.31s -> 365.31s]  and then make the rest of the floor.
[365.31s -> 368.96s]  I don't even need trees.
[368.96s -> 372.96s]  There are a lot of misplaced blocks in this house.
[372.96s -> 373.96s]  Like, look at it.
[373.96s -> 374.96s]  Just look back.
[374.96s -> 378.14s]  I just got rid of most of the wood.
[378.14s -> 380.14s]  And look at this giant horror.
[380.14s -> 382.31s]  Look at how terrible this was.
[382.31s -> 383.31s]  You guys in the comments were right.
[383.31s -> 386.31s]  This house was an absolute horror show.
[386.31s -> 390.73s]  And I knew that.
[390.73s -> 397.25s]  But I was going to deny it until the day I died.
[397.25s -> 400.49s]  Let's start to fill in the blanks here a little bit.
[400.49s -> 403.88s]  If I can jump up here.
[403.88s -> 408.96s]  Okay.
[408.96s -> 410.46s]  So this is the wall.
[410.46s -> 414.23s]  Okay, good.
[414.23s -> 420.44s]  That's the, yeah.
[420.44s -> 422.44s]  Well, I'm going to have to flood the entire basement.
[422.44s -> 424.44s]  I'm going to have to deal with it.
[424.44s -> 425.44s]  Oh, no, my bed.
[425.44s -> 427.74s]  I'm going to get wet sheets.
[427.74s -> 432.84s]  The reason why I'm doing this, I'm making three rooms.
[432.84s -> 434.84s]  At least for the start.
[434.84s -> 438.08s]  I'm going to have this big long room behind the bedroom.
[438.08s -> 442.32s]  Then next to the bedroom is going to be the workstation area.
[442.32s -> 445.82s]  And then that's pretty much the three rooms I want to work with.
[445.82s -> 447.82s]  At least for right now.
[447.82s -> 451.58s]  Let's plug this up.
[451.58s -> 452.58s]  All right.
[452.58s -> 454.58s]  Actually, I probably should do it like this.
[454.58s -> 457.26s]  Makes a little bit more sense that way.
[457.26s -> 459.94s]  Come on, get over there.
[459.94s -> 460.94s]  Get over there, Michael Phelps.
[460.94s -> 461.94s]  Let's go.
[461.94s -> 465.88s]  If anybody got that joke, I applaud you.
[465.88s -> 470.41s]  Give me this.
[470.41s -> 471.41s]  All right, let's put these down now.
[471.41s -> 475.70s]  This is the right level, though.
[475.70s -> 477.70s]  My brain just exploded.
[477.70s -> 480.70s]  I thought I was like two or three blocks up from where I actually was.
[480.70s -> 484.09s]  Oh, damn it.
[484.09s -> 485.09s]  I was.
[485.09s -> 487.09s]  I actually was like a block.
[487.09s -> 489.09s]  Oh, God, bear with me.
[489.09s -> 491.78s]  Okay, let's try this again.
[491.78s -> 494.98s]  Much better.
[494.98s -> 496.98s]  Much better.
[496.98s -> 502.67s]  I don't want to waste them all here, though,
[502.67s -> 504.67s]  because I have an entire room that needs to be finished.
[504.67s -> 506.91s]  This one right here.
[506.91s -> 510.69s]  Oh, look at that.
[510.69s -> 512.69s]  This room is now done with the floor.
[512.69s -> 515.69s]  I'm going to take down that little piece in a minute here.
[515.69s -> 519.76s]  This ground looks like some...
[519.76s -> 521.76s]  Oh, it just looks terrible.
[521.76s -> 522.76s]  I can't even give you a description.
[522.76s -> 523.76s]  It looks that bad.
[523.76s -> 526.58s]  This bed can stay there.
[526.58s -> 529.33s]  Actually, no, it can't.
[529.33s -> 531.76s]  I want to move it,
[531.76s -> 535.51s]  because I want this wall to come down like this
[535.51s -> 538.20s]  and have this opening right here.
[538.20s -> 541.63s]  Let's get rid of the sand for crying out loud.
[541.63s -> 549.34s]  All right, so now here's my thought.
[549.34s -> 550.34s]  Ready?
[550.34s -> 553.77s]  So this is the main room, right?
[553.77s -> 555.77s]  After I get rid of this,
[555.77s -> 556.77s]  can I even get rid of that without...
[556.77s -> 557.77s]  Okay.
[557.77s -> 560.07s]  So here's the main room.
[560.07s -> 563.08s]  I want to be able to do all my crafting,
[563.08s -> 565.08s]  do all my dog training.
[565.08s -> 567.08s]  All that stuff is going to be in this room.
[567.08s -> 571.24s]  Move this out of the way.
[571.24s -> 575.44s]  Might as well bring these things down now, right?
[575.44s -> 579.06s]  Because they've been floating in space for way too long.
[579.06s -> 582.99s]  Okay.
[582.99s -> 584.99s]  Get this off.
[584.99s -> 588.98s]  Probably should not be using this nice pickaxe to do it,
[588.98s -> 590.98s]  but I'll use a sapling.
[590.98s -> 593.74s]  That's not going to work, is it?
[593.74s -> 596.10s]  Maybe it is, but very slowly.
[596.10s -> 599.43s]  Come on now.
[599.43s -> 600.43s]  I know you can do it.
[600.43s -> 603.06s]  I know you can do it.
[603.06s -> 604.62s]  You can do it.
[604.62s -> 606.62s]  Come on now.
[606.62s -> 607.62s]  Come on.
[607.62s -> 609.05s]  It's up there.
[609.05s -> 612.54s]  Oh, I destroyed it.
[612.54s -> 615.49s]  What the hell?
[615.49s -> 617.75s]  Oh, my God.
[617.75s -> 619.75s]  All it took was...
[619.75s -> 621.75s]  Oh, my God.
[621.75s -> 622.99s]  Jeez.
[622.99s -> 623.99s]  All right.
[623.99s -> 625.99s]  I do not want that to happen with that.
[625.99s -> 629.62s]  So I'll figure that out in a second.
[629.62s -> 634.72s]  Breaking my stuff.
[634.72s -> 638.02s]  So I want this whole line to be furnaces.
[638.02s -> 640.02s]  So let's go like this.
[640.02s -> 642.02s]  Put that there.
[642.02s -> 643.90s]  Oh, God.
[643.90s -> 644.90s]  Okay.
[644.90s -> 646.59s]  Did I break that too?
[646.59s -> 647.59s]  No, that's right there.
[647.59s -> 649.73s]  Okay.
[649.73s -> 650.73s]  This here.
[650.73s -> 655.89s]  Put my stuff that I almost just threw up.
[655.89s -> 656.89s]  My slime ball.
[656.89s -> 659.45s]  These are apparently worth a lot.
[659.45s -> 660.45s]  What the hell?
[660.45s -> 662.46s]  What was that?
[662.46s -> 664.46s]  What's hitting me?
[664.46s -> 666.28s]  Oh, shit.
[666.28s -> 667.28s]  Oh, my God.
[667.28s -> 678.26s]  I'm starving to death.
[678.26s -> 679.26s]  I really...
[679.26s -> 681.26s]  Why did I just eat that?
[681.26s -> 684.94s]  I could have just cooked that and got like full health.
[684.94s -> 687.57s]  Oh, my God.
[687.57s -> 688.74s]  Okay.
[688.74s -> 695.05s]  Chalk One Up for Jerma is really an idiot because I thought there was a monster in the ground
[695.05s -> 696.05s]  or something.
[696.05s -> 698.74s]  I was actually just starving to death.
[698.74s -> 702.36s]  My goodness gracious.
