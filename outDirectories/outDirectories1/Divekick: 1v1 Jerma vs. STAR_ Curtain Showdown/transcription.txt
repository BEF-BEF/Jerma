[0.31s -> 18.26s]  Hold on, so you're telling me that I have to use dive and or kick to be able to navigate the menu. I can't hit up or down.
[18.26s -> 22.26s]  No, there is no up, there is no down. There is only dive and there is only kick.
[22.26s -> 27.31s]  This is so dumb.
[27.31s -> 31.31s]  It's pretty hard at first. I think I'm used to it now.
[31.31s -> 36.31s]  Where's my, like, can I change the settings?
[36.31s -> 43.31s]  Yeah, you have to hit them both at the same time to select something or hold the one button to go back.
[43.31s -> 47.31s]  What? Why? Why is this?
[47.31s -> 50.32s]  I don't know, are you not good enough to play this?
[50.32s -> 55.20s]  Dude, I can't even navigate the fucking menu.
[55.20s -> 65.20s]  I like the, okay, can we have a best out of three? This is winner takes all. The loser has to buy the winner new curtains.
[65.20s -> 67.20s]  Okay, new curtains?
[67.20s -> 68.20s]  New curtains.
[68.20s -> 77.88s]  That sounds like a plan to me. Let's go. I can't wait to get the new curtains in the mail.
[77.88s -> 78.88s]  You didn't even kick me.
[78.88s -> 81.18s]  He doesn't, he doesn't have to kick you.
[81.18s -> 86.18s]  He doesn't, what do you mean? This is dive, kick. This is not electrocute move, kick.
[86.18s -> 88.18s]  But it's still pretty much a dive, kick.
[88.18s -> 91.18s]  Okay, all right, whatever. I'm getting those curtains.
[91.18s -> 97.39s]  Are you really going to get the curtains?
[97.39s -> 98.39s]  Yeah, I am.
[98.39s -> 99.39s]  You want these curtains?
[99.39s -> 102.39s]  I'm getting the curtains. I'm getting all kinds of, uh.
[102.39s -> 111.16s]  Is that all you got?
[111.16s -> 123.96s]  Those fucking curtains of mine.
[123.96s -> 124.96s]  You're going down.
[124.96s -> 127.96s]  I picked like the slowest character in the world.
[127.96s -> 128.96s]  He's really good.
[128.96s -> 129.96s]  No, he's slow.
[129.96s -> 131.96s]  You can flip him over to change the type of his kick.
[131.96s -> 133.96s]  Yeah, cool.
[133.96s -> 141.87s]  It's good.
[141.87s -> 143.87s]  I can't get frauded out right here.
[143.87s -> 147.22s]  Yes.
[147.22s -> 151.91s]  I hate that character so much. Who would ever play that character?
[151.91s -> 154.15s]  Me.
[154.15s -> 158.98s]  Oh, nice.
[158.98s -> 159.98s]  Okay, okay.
[159.98s -> 163.54s]  Slowly coming back here. I want those curtains.
[163.54s -> 167.54s]  No, see, when curtains are on the line, you don't even stand a chance.
[167.54s -> 170.80s]  Really? Really?
[170.80s -> 174.36s]  Kurt, I thought it was who's higher.
[174.36s -> 175.36s]  Who's higher? No.
[175.36s -> 176.36s]  I was higher than you.
[176.36s -> 179.36s]  My foot hitbox was in your body. There's a difference.
[179.36s -> 181.36s]  I punched your foot.
[181.36s -> 185.36s]  You didn't punch my foot. I punched your kneecap foot ankle.
[185.36s -> 186.86s]  Idiot.
[186.86s -> 188.86s]  Here we go. No holds barred.
[188.86s -> 192.66s]  Fight.
[192.66s -> 193.66s]  Fight.
[193.66s -> 197.11s]  Oh, die of a kick.
[197.11s -> 200.95s]  Yeah, about those curtains.
[200.95s -> 202.95s]  I want insulated honeycomb.
[202.95s -> 204.95s]  I got some really nice ones.
[204.95s -> 214.30s]  It ain't over yet.
[214.30s -> 216.30s]  Oh, my God.
[216.30s -> 218.30s]  Is he cheating?
[218.30s -> 220.66s]  Oh, my God.
[220.66s -> 225.27s]  Oh, my God.
[225.27s -> 227.27s]  My control is broken.
[227.27s -> 229.51s]  That's the only reason why it just broke.
[229.51s -> 231.51s]  I believe you. I believe you completely.
[231.51s -> 233.51s]  My control, the buttons are all broken on it.
[233.51s -> 235.51s]  I'm lucky to be even playing right now.
[235.51s -> 240.95s]  Your little moves there.
[240.95s -> 245.39s]  Yeah, good job getting lucky, nerd.
[245.39s -> 248.39s]  Take that to the bank and cash it.
[248.39s -> 250.39s]  And make sure to cash this one too.
[250.39s -> 252.39s]  Make sure to cash this one too.
[252.39s -> 257.70s]  Oh, he's getting in his head a little bit here.
[257.70s -> 260.14s]  Oh, you see me grabbing my head.
[260.14s -> 263.14s]  He's getting in his head a little bit here.
[263.14s -> 268.74s]  That's okay. That's okay now that I'm not concussioned.
[268.74s -> 278.64s]  Oh, take that to the kneecap and all the way back.
[278.64s -> 279.64s]  Hey, don't worry.
[279.64s -> 280.64s]  He's getting in his head a little bit.
[280.64s -> 281.64s]  Hey, what's this?
[281.64s -> 286.67s]  What's this? You want me to go like super kick mode?
[286.67s -> 287.67s]  What? It didn't activate on you.
[287.67s -> 289.67s]  You were like right there.
[289.67s -> 290.67s]  You cheated. You basically cheated.
[290.67s -> 291.67s]  That's one to one.
[291.67s -> 292.67s]  That's one to one right there.
[292.67s -> 293.67s]  It's eight to eight.
[293.67s -> 295.67s]  You know, let me tell you.
[295.67s -> 300.67s]  The drapes on my walls could really go good with light blue curtains.
[300.67s -> 301.67s]  Probably satin.
[301.67s -> 303.67s]  It could look really, really good.
[303.67s -> 306.17s]  You don't know what else would look really good?
[306.17s -> 307.17s]  Yeah, what?
[307.17s -> 308.17s]  Your blood on my walls.
[308.17s -> 309.17s]  All right, let's see it.
[309.17s -> 310.17s]  This is the game.
[310.17s -> 318.49s]  This is the deciding game.
[318.49s -> 319.49s]  Damn it.
[319.49s -> 320.49s]  That wasn't your head either?
[320.49s -> 323.24s]  Okay, it's like you don't even have one.
[323.24s -> 326.31s]  Round two, dive kick.
[326.31s -> 328.45s]  Here we go.
[328.45s -> 330.45s]  Stupid ass character.
[330.45s -> 332.45s]  Kick you right in the stomach.
[344.34s -> 348.26s]  Get that out of here.
[348.26s -> 349.26s]  What? It locks on to you?
[349.26s -> 351.26s]  I didn't know it locked on to you.
[351.26s -> 352.26s]  It locks on to you.
[352.26s -> 353.26s]  Oh, my God.
[353.26s -> 356.02s]  All right, let's make this quick.
[359.47s -> 360.47s]  Wow, okay.
[360.47s -> 361.47s]  Somebody got baited.
[361.47s -> 363.47s]  Somebody got baited.
[363.47s -> 367.62s]  My God, no.
[367.62s -> 370.43s]  Come on, fill it up.
[370.43s -> 372.67s]  Oh, here we go.
[372.67s -> 378.06s]  Well, I've got to start picking out some curtains for Jerma.
[382.75s -> 383.75s]  Hit him.
[383.75s -> 388.09s]  Oh, my God.
[388.09s -> 391.09s]  You seriously act like you know what was happening.
[391.09s -> 396.40s]  Where are those curtains?
[396.40s -> 397.40s]  Here's my chance.
[397.40s -> 398.40s]  Here's my chance.
[398.40s -> 400.40s]  I need one more.
[400.40s -> 421.30s]  Get him.
[421.30s -> 423.30s]  You know what's best out of five, right?
[423.30s -> 427.22s]  You heard about that?
[427.22s -> 428.22s]  Did you hear about that?
[428.22s -> 429.22s]  Like it was on the news last night.
[429.22s -> 431.22s]  I was watching the news and it was like best out of five.
[431.22s -> 432.22s]  It was like what?
[432.22s -> 433.22s]  No way.
[433.22s -> 434.22s]  It was crazy.
[434.22s -> 435.22s]  Like everyone was tweeting about it.
[435.22s -> 436.22s]  It was trending.
