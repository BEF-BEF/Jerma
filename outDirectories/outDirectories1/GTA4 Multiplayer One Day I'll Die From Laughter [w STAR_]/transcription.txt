[3.38s -> 7.22s]  Having a cigarette? Yeah, sometimes I'd like to smoke down here.
[15.16s -> 18.42s]  Oh, that was a headshot.
[18.42s -> 22.50s]  I'm pulling off my headphones.
[22.50s -> 31.30s]  I'm gonna pass it out.
[31.30s -> 45.89s]  Did you hit that guy right in the mouth?
[45.89s -> 47.99s]  Did you hit him right in the mouth?
[47.99s -> 53.08s]  Look at this guy. Look at this. Is this an EMT?
[53.08s -> 56.91s]  Is he empty? He's like, what the fuck happened?
[56.91s -> 60.10s]  He's walking away.
[60.10s -> 62.98s]  He doesn't want anything to do with this, I don't think.
[63.98s -> 68.78s]  I just took a drink. I was about to start spitting up. Oh my god.
[68.78s -> 71.58s]  The EMT around the corner just doesn't want any part of it.
[71.58s -> 74.98s]  Yo, the EMT. This guy's like, look, he's driving away.
[77.54s -> 83.21s]  That might have been the funniest clip I've ever seen in GTA.
[83.21s -> 87.81s]  I'm serious. That really might have been the funniest clip I've ever fucking seen in this game.
[87.81s -> 98.82s]  What? Where? Where am I? Where are we?
[98.82s -> 101.97s]  What? What's going on?
[101.97s -> 104.77s]  You're disappearing when I drive here on my screen.
[104.77s -> 108.17s]  There is no where I'm seeing like underneath the ground.
[108.17s -> 113.30s]  I'm not even on your bike. Try to like keep going.
[113.30s -> 116.10s]  Where are we? Oh, wait, where am I?
[116.10s -> 120.76s]  Why did I turn into you? Press to get off the bike.
[120.76s -> 124.06s]  It says you're on it, but you're not there.
[124.06s -> 126.76s]  What is this guy doing? Yeah, you're invisible.
[126.76s -> 130.32s]  There's a guy in here too. Can you see this guy?
[130.32s -> 133.62s]  No. He just got on the bike.
[133.62s -> 142.09s]  What? What?
[142.09s -> 147.43s]  Who is that phantom? Who is that guy?
[147.43s -> 152.39s]  Am I on the... Keep going.
[152.39s -> 154.89s]  What? I don't know if you're invisible.
[154.89s -> 157.69s]  Whoever you're fighting isn't here. I'm so confused.
[157.69s -> 160.09s]  Dude, this is insane.
[160.09s -> 163.93s]  There's another guy on the bike in like the ghost world.
[163.93s -> 170.62s]  Just smash into something. Can I fight this guy?
[170.62s -> 175.98s]  This guy had a machine gun.
[175.98s -> 179.18s]  Can you kill yourself? Apparently I'm falling now.
[179.18s -> 180.78s]  I'm doing like a dance.
[180.78s -> 185.30s]  I'm doing like a Blues Brothers dance.
[185.30s -> 187.10s]  I'm trying to find a way to like get out of here.
[187.10s -> 199.57s]  Like another way to like another dimension.
[199.57s -> 203.07s]  Like we're just both quiet. Just like, yes, yes.
[203.07s -> 206.68s]  Yeah, well, you don't like hang on doors for fun.
[206.68s -> 209.48s]  Every pedestrian that walks by too looks at you and is like,
[209.48s -> 212.80s]  What the fuck? Where are they?
[212.80s -> 221.20s]  I want to get somebody over here.
[221.20s -> 226.28s]  You don't think you're not going to say anything?
[226.28s -> 228.18s]  That was weird. You should have said something.
[228.18s -> 231.10s]  You should have said something about that.
[231.10s -> 234.10s]  Get in the middle of the road, Jerma.
[234.10s -> 238.35s]  This guy's an idiot. He's aiming the gun at you.
[238.35s -> 241.91s]  You're not even close to being over here.
[241.91s -> 251.82s]  What is he doing? What is he doing?
[251.82s -> 253.62s]  I'm like hanging out with the cop.
[253.62s -> 280.06s]  He's utterly confused right now.
[280.06s -> 286.56s]  So lady, do you know how to get to 42nd Street from here?
[286.56s -> 287.96s]  Well, yes, it's very easy.
[287.96s -> 293.26s]  What you want to do son is you want to go.
[293.26s -> 294.06s]  You got to listen to this guy.
[294.06s -> 295.06s]  This guy just said to pull over.
[295.06s -> 296.36s]  You have to listen.
[296.36s -> 298.22s]  Okay.
[298.22s -> 299.42s]  All right. He said get out of the car.
[299.42s -> 300.52s]  Okay.
[300.52s -> 301.32s]  I'm sorry officer.
[301.32s -> 302.72s]  I got a gun.
[302.72s -> 306.32s]  I don't want. I don't want to get.
[306.32s -> 310.29s]  What is this? What's going?
[310.29s -> 315.50s]  We'll see one eventually.
[315.50s -> 317.60s]  Yeah. Look for one. Look for one.
[317.60s -> 318.50s]  I'm trying.
[318.60s -> 319.90s]  Do you see the subway?
[319.90s -> 320.50s]  I think so.
[320.50s -> 324.91s]  I think this one over still alive with my parachute.
[324.91s -> 325.91s]  Put it on.
[325.91s -> 327.95s]  Oh epic.
[327.95s -> 329.45s]  Epic.
[329.45s -> 335.10s]  Absolutely epic.
[335.10s -> 337.38s]  Epic.
[337.38s -> 339.58s]  That shouldn't have killed me.
[339.58s -> 341.18s]  What is?
[341.18s -> 341.88s]  Oh, right.
[341.88s -> 345.73s]  You're in a helicopter.
[345.73s -> 346.63s]  What is this place?
[346.63s -> 348.13s]  I don't remember any of this.
[348.13s -> 349.73s]  Are you getting the weird territory though?
[349.73s -> 352.98s]  Because I don't like you.
[352.98s -> 353.68s]  I saw a sick jump.
[353.68s -> 355.88s]  Hold on sick jump.
[361.79s -> 366.86s]  You talking about the slide?
[366.86s -> 368.36s]  Yeah, it's like a ramp.
[368.36s -> 369.36s]  That was so stupid.
[369.36s -> 369.96s]  Are you on this?
[369.96s -> 371.26s]  What's going on?
[371.26s -> 372.36s]  Who's on it?
[372.36s -> 374.46s]  You're on it.
[374.46s -> 375.46s]  I can't.
[375.46s -> 378.75s]  I'm trying to get off.
[378.75s -> 379.85s]  No, don't.
