[4.09s -> 13.64s]  Why, hello there. How are you? How you doing? Moving the ice cube around in my drink. Hold on.
[14.28s -> 25.43s]  This is a big ice cube. I like big ice cubes though. Who cares? Hi, welcome to another stream.
[26.23s -> 39.19s]  Me, Jerma. How you doing? Who cares? How big are the ice cubes? All right, the best part about a
[39.19s -> 47.75s]  huge ice cube is it takes so long to melt. That doesn't dilute your drink. How do I feel? Okay,
[47.75s -> 59.27s]  so I feel... Let me go over my sort of COVID story, I guess. So, I think I'm over it. I have
[59.27s -> 65.51s]  to test again to see if I'm still kind of shedding the virus, but I lost my sense of taste and smell
[65.51s -> 71.43s]  for a little while, which that's scary, because who knows with that, right? I'm still a little
[71.43s -> 78.33s]  sloppy. I would say I'm not sick anymore. I have a residual cough, like kind of deep in my throat,
[78.33s -> 85.61s]  in my kind of chest area, but I wouldn't say that I am sick. I was sick. I'm definitely,
[85.61s -> 95.83s]  I'm definitely over it, but maybe not completely. Yeah, I just kind of feel sloppy. But yeah,
[95.83s -> 103.13s]  I'm doing better. And here we are. We are going to do a couple things today. Well, couple by one,
[103.77s -> 109.24s]  I have a very important thing to talk about with Origin. I told you and everyone thought I was
[109.24s -> 118.41s]  crazy, but it was true. So, today we're going to play The Sims 4. No mods, no additional modded
[118.41s -> 125.26s]  content. And I think there's a couple of reasons why. Every single time I've played The Sims on
[125.26s -> 131.99s]  stream, an hour goes by and people start killing each other. That's my, that's every single one of
[131.99s -> 141.24s]  my streams for The Sims. So, I've never really experienced any of these expansions. And I got
[141.24s -> 148.50s]  a lot of them. I have almost everything. So, if I have the mods installed, I'm going to be tempted
[148.50s -> 155.61s]  to use them. And that includes like the funny faces mods. I want to do a vanilla Sims 4 with
[155.61s -> 166.58s]  every expansion play. I won't, I can't ever do it. It's like playing GTA and you get through the
[166.58s -> 171.99s]  second or third story mission and then you just start doing the cheats and you don't even play
[171.99s -> 176.87s]  the rest of the game. You just run around and just fly around with like the mods and stuff.
[176.87s -> 184.30s]  I don't even play the game. This man doesn't know that non-murder mods exist. I know, but
[187.80s -> 193.64s]  I cannot install the like the drug mod yet. Which by the way, if you, and I will say this,
[194.28s -> 199.94s]  the hardest I've ever laughed in the ever that I've ever streamed. If you want to know the one time,
[199.94s -> 205.24s]  I think I've said it before, the hardest I've ever laughed on stream to a point where it physically
[205.24s -> 210.12s]  caused me discomfort and hurt me. I don't know if there's any clips of it. It was a long time ago.
[210.76s -> 216.84s]  It was a guy was on drugs with the drug mod and he walked his dog in his house
[219.83s -> 223.35s]  and the dog like pissed on the ground. It started like rolling around in it.
[223.35s -> 228.63s]  I know that that whole concept was just unbelievable that you would put like, oh,
[228.63s -> 237.94s]  put like the leash on the dog and walk your dog in your house. I think that's the, I think that
[237.94s -> 242.50s]  gave me a hernia. I think that's the day that I got it and it developed. I actually believe that.
[244.70s -> 251.19s]  I remember having to wheel away from the computer because it hurts so much to even be in this room.
[253.06s -> 259.40s]  And that was a lot, not this room. That was a long time ago. You can't get a hernia like that.
[259.40s -> 264.89s]  I don't know, man. This, this hiatal hernia that I have, I feel like I gave it to myself somehow.
[270.39s -> 273.35s]  Can you start playing? We're just hanging out for a second. Hold on.
[274.07s -> 280.31s]  You're going to play The Sims 2. We played The Sims 2 earlier this year.
[282.94s -> 285.98s]  I don't know. Do I, this is where I'm going to leave this up to you to help me.
[287.14s -> 293.11s]  I don't think I'm, I'm just going to make some random guy, right? I was going to make a random
[293.11s -> 297.91s]  person. I don't think I wanted to be like, oh, making like Jerma and it's going to be like the
[297.91s -> 302.31s]  Jerma house. No, no, no. We're just going to, we're going to pick a guy and we're going to play as
[303.56s -> 312.73s]  random guy. I've done the, hey, it's Jerma playing in The Sims, Jerma985. I've done that like 10 times.
[316.47s -> 324.73s]  We played all of them except for two. What? Didn't I play The Sims 2 earlier this year?
[324.73s -> 332.42s]  That was, that was The Sims. No, it was The Sims 2. But I don't know what I want to do because I,
[332.42s -> 342.66s]  it's overwhelming and I got to say something to Origin and EA. Guys, why is there, why is there
[342.66s -> 347.94s]  not an option? Should I even do this? I feel like everyone's waiting for me to do this.
[348.90s -> 354.63s]  Is everybody waiting for this? Everyone's like leaning back. Here he goes. He's going to,
[354.63s -> 358.47s]  he's going to talk about there's no cart on Origin for 20 minutes. I feel like everyone
[358.47s -> 364.52s]  just leaned back and was waiting. Do I need to, I don't think I even need to do this right now.
[364.52s -> 369.80s]  No, I don't think so. I'm going to, okay, I'll do it in one sentence instead of like 25 sentences.
[370.52s -> 374.92s]  So we're going to do that in one sentence instead of doing a 25 sentence explanation of what I mean
[374.92s -> 382.60s]  by this. So here comes the one sentence to explain this and it goes as follows. There is no add to
[382.60s -> 388.36s]  cart option when you're trying to buy shit on Origin for The Sims. There's like a hundred things
[388.36s -> 395.32s]  to buy individually. There's no Omega bundles. There's bundles with like three things in it out
[395.32s -> 405.29s]  of a hundred. How is there no cart? How is it? I just don't get it. And people said, dude, just
[405.29s -> 411.69s]  buy it on Steam. Listen, I already bought like five or six expansions on Origin. So I was like,
[411.69s -> 418.09s]  I guess I'll just do it on Origin. And I had to, I had to tell my bank, I got texted by my bank.
[418.09s -> 421.93s]  Hey, we've declined purchases. There's like all these like fraudulent purchases going through the
[421.93s -> 433.67s]  EA store. Like, no, that's me. That's me and it's dumb. I was individually buying every one of these
[433.67s -> 439.35s]  things. I was, dude, I was sitting there. I thought I was crazy. I'm like, there has to be a different
[439.35s -> 445.59s]  way to do this on Origin. I was like looking up like adding things to cart Origin. I don't, why?
[447.51s -> 452.63s]  You have to go through the checkout process on each individual. Oh, one sentence. Shit.
[454.15s -> 462.60s]  I'm sorry. Oh my God. I didn't, I didn't realize I was doing that. All right. All right. All right.
[462.60s -> 465.56s]  All right. All right. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done.
[465.56s -> 471.48s]  Fuck. Oh, I'm like embarrassed. That was at least 20 sentences. That was more than 25. Okay. All
[471.48s -> 475.26s]  right. All right. All right. Enough, enough, enough. We're going to play The Sims 4.
[482.92s -> 487.85s]  Oh shit. You know, it's like, you just know that you just get called out with something
[487.85s -> 496.94s]  and it's completely true and it just makes you angry. No. Hey, we got to take, we're going to
[496.94s -> 501.99s]  take the dollhouse out of the, out of the title. People are going to see German dollhouse and
[501.99s -> 505.67s]  they're going to go, what? This is another dollhouse. Oh, we got to get that out of the title.
[506.47s -> 518.39s]  Okay. Hold on. Origin doesn't have a shopping cart like that. Items are all purchased one
[518.47s -> 522.87s]  time for the origin store. The only exception would be the build your own bundle option.
[524.68s -> 534.15s]  What? Build your own bundle. Build your own bundle. Where is that? Where is build your own bundle?
[536.54s -> 545.27s]  Is this a pizza place? What do you mean build your own bundle? The bundle is three items at once
[545.27s -> 554.38s]  though. Build your own bundle. I don't, if it's available, it's not advertised at all.
[554.94s -> 563.96s]  I was looking for it everywhere. All right. Okay. I can one of the mods change that title
[563.96s -> 569.00s]  to something that I spent two hours individually buying all these DLCs. You better enjoy. That's
[569.00s -> 580.12s]  better. Build your own bundle. I'm so annoyed and I'm going to get over it. All right. So let's go.
[580.76s -> 589.21s]  And I know I'm going to get the comments of like, Oh dude, but like, Oh yeah. You just want to be
[589.21s -> 593.85s]  able to click one button and spend a thousand dollars. It's like, I, I don't want to do that.
[593.85s -> 601.05s]  I just want to add stuff to cards. I don't need like the, the kitten costume pack. I don't want
[601.05s -> 604.09s]  that. I just want the stuff that I want, but I don't want to individually buy every single one
[604.09s -> 612.06s]  of them. But I think, you know what? I think I did buy like the pet costume pack. I don't know why,
[612.06s -> 621.34s]  but I did. He said we get started and people are going to be, I got to, I'm going to preemptively
[621.34s -> 628.62s]  tell you this. Um, just so you understand. Yes. Yes, there is. It is a, it is a different. Did I
[628.62s -> 646.04s]  tweet? Did I tweet this yet? I did. All right. What's on the screen? Jesus. All right. Here comes a
[646.04s -> 649.32s]  new game and let me turn the camera on. Everyone's going to freak out. All right. Okay. Everyone's
[649.32s -> 656.06s]  going to lose their mind. Yes. It is a new angle. It's a new, there is a new camera angle today and
[656.06s -> 659.74s]  people are going to think there's like a, there's a monster's not coming out of this door. I just
[659.82s -> 664.54s]  want to make sure everyone understands. I'm not in a new, this is not a new house. This is not a new
[664.54s -> 673.00s]  place. And a monster's not coming out of this door. Okay. Why are you so red? Because I'm a,
[673.00s -> 679.08s]  I don't know. I've, I've, I don't know. Where's the red shelf? It's, I'm going to put something
[679.08s -> 684.39s]  here instead. I just, I wanted to change some shit around. I wanted to move the room around.
[684.39s -> 690.76s]  You know, when you just kind of feel like, you know, the room is getting stale, the room's a
[690.76s -> 696.28s]  little stale. I want to make this better, right? You just kind of have to change it up. That's how
[696.28s -> 701.67s]  it happened. Anyways, is the camera delayed? Somebody's saying the camera's behind. It really
[701.67s -> 717.10s]  shouldn't be. Let's find out why. Is it behind? And audio slightly. Really? That's weird. Is it
[717.10s -> 730.76s]  behind? Maybe not. I just don't think I move my lips that much sometimes when I talk. The audio's
[730.76s -> 740.06s]  behind. Is it? That's weird. I don't know. I don't know why I can do this, but I can. I can't escape.
[740.06s -> 750.14s]  All right, let's go. Can you hear it? You guys can hear it, right? All right. We're going to,
[750.14s -> 753.50s]  we're going to make a sim and we're going to play. I don't know. There's like werewolves and shit.
[754.71s -> 764.74s]  I got the werewolf expansion. I don't know what to do. Okay. So hello. We'll do the name last.
[766.78s -> 772.36s]  And should there be more than one person in this house? Skip 10 hours. We're not going to spend,
[772.36s -> 776.36s]  I'm telling you, I promise we're going to spend 20 minutes in the character creator, maybe 15
[776.36s -> 801.70s]  total. Maybe. I already kind of like it. You need to have a dog too. I don't want to do a bunch of
[801.70s -> 809.43s]  animals because every time there's ever been animals, it's like they make like seven and
[809.43s -> 816.44s]  there's like five to seven animals in the house. And it sucks because it's like, it's like,
[816.44s -> 821.48s]  there's too many animals in the house. Just one pet. All right. Maybe we'll do one. All right.
[821.48s -> 826.98s]  First of all, I gotta remember how to play this game. I think, I don't think I want to do anything
[826.98s -> 836.66s]  else. I think this is perfect. I don't know why I like this. That's not me. I don't look like this.
[837.30s -> 862.74s]  Yeah. There's no, there's no slider mods. We're just doing straight up regular The Sims. I want
[862.74s -> 896.82s]  to keep the hair. I think the hair is perfect. What do you mean? I lied already. It's got to be
[896.82s -> 902.33s]  okay. I want him to, I want him to, why am I so red? That's weird. I just looked over here and saw
[902.33s -> 909.16s]  that. I want it to be a little weird, but I don't want it to be crazy. I don't want it to be insane
[909.16s -> 958.86s]  looking. Holy shit. Okay. I like it so far. Hold on. What do you think? I think that's good.
[958.86s -> 971.13s]  What about the shoulders? I don't know. I'm kind of torn between the wide. All right. This is,
[971.13s -> 995.77s]  you gave him reptilian eyes. All right. What about, those are small feet. How tall is this?
[995.77s -> 1015.85s]  Let me look at the hair. I don't know. This looks pretty good. I think I'm all right with this one.
[1015.85s -> 1024.41s]  All right. He's going to have huge forearms and small biceps. I think that's fine. Big hands.
[1024.41s -> 1031.35s]  I need to make his hands as big as they can possibly be. How do I pick his hands?
[1044.06s -> 1052.86s]  What are the aspirations going to be? This is going to be interesting. How do I give him big
[1052.86s -> 1073.96s]  hands? You can't. Oh, okay. All right. I need, we got to do clothes. Okay. That looks good. All
[1073.96s -> 1086.49s]  right. Clothes. I really, I don't care about the clothes that much. It kind of looks like he would
[1086.57s -> 1108.73s]  be on Pee Wee's Playhouse. All right. How about just outfits? How about, oh, styled looks. Oh,
[1108.73s -> 1114.33s]  what? I made, I got the, the Star Wars shit. I could make him like a Jedi. Is that like a path
[1114.33s -> 1121.82s]  you can take? Can I get, I can, I can give this guy a lightsaber and that's not modern. I swear.
[1121.82s -> 1140.52s]  What is this? After party. No, no, no, no. This is every day, right? Oh, wait. I don't, is this a
[1140.52s -> 1150.90s]  fanged and wild? Oh, it's a werewolf. Am I going werewolf right off the bat? I don't know if I'm
[1150.90s -> 1169.42s]  doing werewolf. These are all werewolves. Okay. Something about this is what I actually kind of
[1169.42s -> 1196.74s]  like. You made Adam Sandler. What? No, I'm going to hate this after like 15 minutes. Something else.
[1196.74s -> 1201.94s]  I got to finish the face. Get the, we got to get the hat off or maybe not. No, he can't just
[1201.94s -> 1212.46s]  be like a weirdo. Why is this locked? First order rank three trooper. You're going to be a storm
[1212.46s -> 1231.14s]  trooper? Is that a career path? That's all right. I'm sticking with this. So what is this? This is
[1231.14s -> 1246.95s]  party. Okay. This is for a party. Okay. All right. Summertime. You're going to keep the
[1246.95s -> 1267.29s]  glasses. All right. This is fun. I think this is all right. Every day. I don't like them.
[1267.29s -> 1284.74s]  Please change the outfit. We can change the outfit later. All right. We need to make personality now.
[1284.74s -> 1295.75s]  All right. Aspiration, family, food, location, knowledge, nature, wellness, werewolf. Okay.
[1296.39s -> 1300.31s]  These Sims get an initial relationship boost when introducing themselves to werewolves.
[1300.31s -> 1311.67s]  Do I have to talk to other werewolves? They get Star Wars. Wait, what? Sims who are prepared
[1311.67s -> 1322.74s]  voyagers fill up their needs slightly when, God, this is perfect. Hope versus order or galactic
[1322.74s -> 1328.82s]  privateer. This Sim isn't about choosing sides. They're happy just mingling among the smugglers
[1328.82s -> 1334.02s]  and bounty hunters on the fringe planet of Batuu. Burning a few extra credits along the way is just
[1334.02s -> 1341.13s]  a bonus no matter how they get them. Okay. On the world of Batuu, there is a growing conflict.
[1341.13s -> 1348.92s]  This Sim, there's no Star Wars shit in this, in real life. What? Is this just, I'm like a fan of
[1348.92s -> 1356.36s]  Star Wars or am I actually going to be like a lightsaber wielding attacker? You know, with the,
[1356.36s -> 1362.58s]  why can I not say the, why can I not say the fucking word? Bounty hunter. I'm just a bounty
[1362.58s -> 1381.18s]  hunter. This is, okay. This is Jedi. Which one of these gets me a lightsaber? The left one. Okay.
[1381.82s -> 1384.94s]  Understand whether they should stand with the resistance of the first order. All right. You
[1384.94s -> 1394.06s]  got it. That's, okay. That's what we're doing. That's what we're doing. All right. So what else?
[1394.06s -> 1401.61s]  Likes and dislikes. Activities. And you know what? You love bowling. You know why? Because I bought
[1401.61s -> 1409.29s]  the expansion. How do I add it? Okay. Does that mean you like it or you don't like it? Okay.
[1409.29s -> 1422.20s]  Okay. You like bowling? What else? How about rock climbing? You can choose up to 20.
[1423.74s -> 1432.44s]  Is there a lightsabers or something? I like lightsabers. What else is there? Favorite color
[1432.44s -> 1447.40s]  is Sith. I'm a Sith Lord. Okay. Favorite music genre. Excuse me. Where's video game music?
[1447.48s -> 1466.06s]  Lullabies? Where's video game music? How about romance music? Dude, retro music. Yep. Doesn't
[1466.06s -> 1477.58s]  like pop. How about activities? Definitely comedy. Do kids radio? Wait, you can do kids radio?
[1485.64s -> 1492.87s]  Okay. All right. So, so far we're okay. So what about activities? You like bowling? You like
[1492.87s -> 1507.62s]  acting? No, no, no. You like mischief? You like playing the piano? And you don't like singing?
[1508.98s -> 1515.83s]  And you don't like video games? You like writing? And you like snowboarding? And you think rocket
[1515.83s -> 1519.43s]  science is cool, but you don't like the pipe organ? And you like programming on the side?
[1520.07s -> 1523.27s]  Rock climbing is kind of fun, but you don't like it that much. You actually hate it.
[1523.27s -> 1539.38s]  Okay. What else? All right. Traits. Hot headed. Loomy. Genius. All right. What did we, what's,
[1539.38s -> 1544.31s]  okay. It's going to have to be something like self-assured, right? Confident. If you're going
[1544.31s -> 1553.67s]  to be a Jedi, then you have to be pretty confident. I would imagine you'd be pretty confident. Bookworm?
[1553.67s -> 1565.29s]  Geek. Oh, I just voice cracked a little. All right. So you're self-assured. You're kind of a geek.
[1565.29s -> 1573.43s]  I mean, if you're choosing as your career to be a Star Wars Jedi master, you have to be a nerd,
[1573.43s -> 1578.42s]  right? That's not, that's not an insult. That's just, I mean, you kind of have to be a geek,
[1578.42s -> 1593.30s]  right? How about a perfectionist? How about lazy? Make a lazy Jedi? A squee, oh, no, no, no, no, no,
[1593.30s -> 1601.13s]  no. We need like squeamish. How is he going to handle the Sith Lord? So he's going to see
[1601.13s -> 1620.10s]  somebody get like slashed with a lightsaber and just start puking. All right. Proper cat lover.
[1620.10s -> 1629.51s]  I think this is good. I think this is good. Think of a vegetarian. I don't, I don't, I don't know
[1629.51s -> 1640.63s]  a name. What's a good name? Hello, my name is, I don't know. What's like a, what's a good name?
[1641.64s -> 1644.28s]  John? No, John, that's.
[1652.68s -> 1663.05s]  You just said what a Sim says in conversation. You did. That's just, that means like, hello,
[1663.05s -> 1678.54s]  Blork Snorkels. I'm going to say this out loud because I think this is a very terrible name
[1678.54s -> 1687.19s]  for a Sim, but I do enjoy the comedic effort for Jerkel Hoffman. I do appreciate the effort.
[1687.58s -> 1704.25s]  Effort is there. How about, no, I'm not going to name him Stinky Dinky. I always have such
[1704.25s -> 1734.90s]  trouble with names. I just can't do them. Bobby Tom Tatooine? No, that sucks. No, I'm not going
[1734.90s -> 1740.66s]  to name the guy Bobby Jerkoff. He's not going to be named Jerkoff anything. Not Bobby Jerkoff,
[1740.66s -> 1744.90s]  not Jerkoff Stevenson. I'm sorry. That's not this person's name. So we're going to like move on.
[1745.46s -> 1774.55s]  We're moving on. What's a Bobby, Bob, Bill, Bill Solo. That's even worse. How about, what was it,
[1774.55s -> 1813.06s]  Blorg, Blorg's, Blorg Solo? I like Blorg Solo. How about Blorg McDonald's? This is the hardest
[1813.14s -> 1834.01s]  part. I can't do it. I hate this. Blorg Hendrix, Blorg McNulty. Do we like Blorg McNulty? That seems
[1834.01s -> 1846.63s]  actually pretty good. OK, we got Blorg McNulty. Who's next? We have to do a pet, right? We have
[1846.63s -> 1856.26s]  to make a dog. One dog, one dog, no cats, one dog. I'm not making 10 animals. It's hard to take care
[1856.26s -> 1868.34s]  of them all. It's going to be a poodle. It has to be a Star Wars looking dog. You know what I mean?
[1868.34s -> 1873.50s]  How do I make like a Star Wars character? Can I make like the legs bigger and stuff?
[1873.50s -> 1900.28s]  I need to make like a Star Wars monster. There's no body slider enhancements or anything. So
[1902.46s -> 1947.64s]  I can't do those right now. All right. I like it so far. What about ears? Hold on.
[1947.64s -> 1966.41s]  I think it has to stay this way. It has to stay that way. Yeah. The dog's name is going to be
[1966.41s -> 1998.95s]  Chewie. It looks like Otto. OK, I think Chewie's fine. Is that too much? Is it too weird? OK,
[1999.11s -> 2021.96s]  how do I change the coat? I think that's fine. Think of a green dog. Chewie's not green.
[2026.70s -> 2061.14s]  This looks strange. No, this doesn't make any sense. It's Yoda. That's actually. All right.
[2062.26s -> 2084.87s]  Yeah. No, it's going to be like yodel, right? I'm not getting sued. This is yodel. You don't
[2084.87s -> 2095.67s]  need. You just yodel. Yodel. That's it. Yodel. All right. What do you like? Smart. What is this?
[2095.67s -> 2116.79s]  Oh, OK. Smart troublemaker. Aggressive. I don't want it. Hunter. Jedi. Active. Smart. And no,
[2116.79s -> 2125.10s]  not vocal. Special effects dog. Yeah, you guys can key this dog out whenever you want.
[2125.10s -> 2140.38s]  Whenever you feel like it. I think yodel. Yodel. Yodel is fine. I don't look. I want to play the
[2140.38s -> 2146.49s]  video game right far too many times that I've opened this game. We make a bunch of weirdos
[2146.49s -> 2151.46s]  and then they all attack each other and stab each other and shoot each other. Well, I we need to
[2151.46s -> 2158.33s]  play the Sims. You know what I mean? We need to keep these people around. And it happens within
[2158.33s -> 2164.23s]  like an hour. And then I sit around. Do you remember last time I played this when an hour
[2164.23s -> 2169.14s]  went by, they started killing each other and then I dropped two meteors on their house.
[2169.14s -> 2172.58s]  And then I was like, I don't know what to do now. Like, I can't play the game anymore. I can't play
[2172.58s -> 2177.70s]  it. There's no you don't go make macaroni and cheese after that. It's over. You don't go back
[2177.70s -> 2181.96s]  and like, yeah, I guess I'm going to queue up, go to the fridge, take a shower and take a bath.
[2181.96s -> 2190.84s]  No, no, you can't. We can't go that way. Why do you look like this? I don't know. Do the deal.
[2190.84s -> 2196.12s]  Yeah, we're going to do DLC. All right. This is the house. We've got the dog. We've got the guy
[2196.12s -> 2201.40s]  and I'm done. I'm not micromanaging 10 people. It's impossible. What the fuck did somebody
[2201.40s -> 2215.03s]  just post? Your webcam audio is late. What is happening? Are you guys for real? All right,
[2215.03s -> 2225.05s]  I'm ready. Let's take this household. We have everything we need. It's the McNulty family.
[2225.05s -> 2247.78s]  Wait, I want a different pose. How do I do a different pose? I like that one. It's off by
[2247.78s -> 2258.78s]  a split second. I don't know why that would be the case. Hold on. Oh, I do know why it's off.
[2258.78s -> 2268.33s]  It is off your. Yeah, it is because of the delay coming through. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's
[2268.33s -> 2288.74s]  not. It's not fun. Is it? Am I? Is it one guy? OK. Oh, is it early? I thought I had a delay,
[2288.74s -> 2295.38s]  but I didn't. All right. So this is important. It's very important. I have like every expansion
[2295.38s -> 2301.02s]  I have no idea where to go or what to do. What season should this be? Spring is a great time
[2301.02s -> 2304.46s]  to plant your garden to take advantage. I don't know. We're not doing that. Temperatures are
[2304.46s -> 2307.74s]  climbing, so beat the heat with water balloons and sprinklers. Watch out for the thunderstorms.
[2307.74s -> 2315.62s]  All right. That's kind of cool. Gather your garden. No, no garden. When you're not bundled
[2315.62s -> 2321.83s]  up indoors, have some fun in the snow and ice. All right. Summer or fall, summer or winter.
[2321.83s -> 2337.62s]  I mean, can we get a poll in the chat? Let's get a poll. Summer or winter.
[2337.62s -> 2361.10s]  Pick one. Whoever gets more wins. You got to pick one that shouldn't have been on.
[2361.10s -> 2367.61s]  So did my mic sound fucked up because that literally should not have been turned on?
[2367.61s -> 2378.63s]  Are we good now? It actually probably sounds better now. Winter is winning by a landslide.
[2378.63s -> 2387.93s]  Oh, my God, it is. OK, yeah. Let me just double check there's not some weird setting that I turned
[2387.93s -> 2395.10s]  on. I don't think there is. No, I don't have any like filters on. I don't have any delays on.
[2396.22s -> 2401.18s]  Everything's set to be not delayed or anything. That's so weird. I wonder why.
[2401.18s -> 2414.74s]  All right. Winter. I bought a bunch of winter packs too. I have no idea. This is so overwhelming.
[2414.74s -> 2422.78s]  I'm not going here. That's what I know. Newcrest, Magnolia, Promenade, Windenburg,
[2423.66s -> 2437.70s]  Sand, Forgotten Hollow, Del Sol Valley, Glimmer Brook, a mountain, Moonwood Mill.
[2439.05s -> 2446.39s]  Go to Forgotten Hollow. OK, this looks like a werewolf one. Go to Glimmer Brook.
[2446.39s -> 2449.35s]  The quiet town of Glimmer Brook may have more to it than meets the eye.
[2449.35s -> 2456.31s]  But do I want to do a bunch of weird shit right off the bat? This is like a map.
[2458.30s -> 2468.84s]  This place sucks. There's one place to live. What? There's one house and a bar.
[2473.50s -> 2480.25s]  Only one person gets to live here? Well, there's a magical portal. That's kind of cool.
[2480.25s -> 2489.82s]  How do I go back? What's the other one? All right. This is like a scary place.
[2489.82s -> 2500.55s]  It's like Halloween town. This place. This place. It looks weird. It's weird. Two story.
[2500.55s -> 2509.37s]  This place is it's eighteen thousand dollars. Yeah, but people can visit you from around the
[2509.37s -> 2516.70s]  world, right? Now we're starting. We're starting normal. I can move to one of these places.
[2516.70s -> 2529.40s]  Keep that in mind. What about what's this? Oh, look at this. This place is a bustling town.
[2529.40s -> 2539.34s]  How much does this place cost? Oh, look at this one. So where is this? Starlight Boulevard. Have I?
[2539.34s -> 2543.93s]  Sims cannot live on this residence. Didn't I do a thing where I was trying to be like a famous
[2543.93s -> 2562.01s]  person? Was that Sims 3? No, this place sucks. Boo boo boo. Go to the mountain. Let me check it out.
[2562.01s -> 2579.75s]  Oh, look at this place. It's got a ski resort. This is only two grand. This is perfect. I think
[2579.75s -> 2585.91s]  I want to do the mountain town either. OK, it's a toss up here. All right. I'm going to give you some
[2585.91s -> 2600.90s]  choices here. The mountain town. What's this? Wow. Wow. This is unbelievably beautiful here.
[2600.90s -> 2609.85s]  There's a big fountain. It's like a port. I think I think I'm making my decision. I'm going to buy
[2609.85s -> 2614.12s]  this place right on the beach. I'm doing a beach house. You can batches me all you want. That's
[2614.12s -> 2623.61s]  fine. Hold on. All right. This is kind of a city. We can visit this place, right? We can visit.
[2623.61s -> 2633.66s]  I'm doing a beach. The beach. Yeah, beach. I'm going for it. Let's go. It's time. Unfurnished.
[2633.66s -> 2644.89s]  I'm going to build the house. Bat chest. I got we got eighteen thousand dollars. It's winter.
[2648.38s -> 2651.02s]  Yeah, but I'll be I'll prepare for the where's my where do I build?
[2651.74s -> 2658.82s]  Oh, this is I don't want to wait. This is where I have to build right on the water.
[2658.82s -> 2668.41s]  Wait, where's my house going to be? That's kind of I don't know. I don't know about that.
[2671.22s -> 2674.10s]  This is it. Look at this. Look at this neighborhood. All right. We'll go for it.
[2674.10s -> 2677.06s]  We'll go for it. If I don't like it, I'll just fucking do the cheat and bulldoze it and go
[2677.06s -> 2685.85s]  somewhere else. All right. Build time. Let's go. Challenge yourself. No, thank you. This is new
[2685.85s -> 2698.46s]  music. All right. First things first. We got to do the right angle here and I want to be able to
[2698.46s -> 2705.86s]  literally just look out my window and there's the water. You know what I mean? Right here.
[2705.86s -> 2715.03s]  OK, this is a mailbox. Yep. All right. Let's do it. OK, here we go. This lot is not that big.
[2715.11s -> 2724.28s]  There's not very much space. OK, let's start with just right here.
[2724.28s -> 2729.83s]  I don't want to blow all my money. Hold on. Wait, don't do that. How about like this?
[2729.83s -> 2738.57s]  How do I flip? How do you flip something? Is it middle mouse? How do you flip something?
[2738.57s -> 2745.75s]  How do you flip? L? What are you doing? How would you do that? How do you flip something?
[2745.75s -> 2770.78s]  R? No. Period. There it is. Thank you. This is going to be much bigger.
[2770.78s -> 2780.54s]  How much money do I have? I don't blow everything. All right. So this is going to be
[2780.54s -> 2798.30s]  the kitchen kind of bathroom area. Oh, shit. I'm putting it. All right. Well,
[2798.30s -> 2808.31s]  that's actually makes sense, right? How do I do the angle pitch? What's upstairs?
[2808.31s -> 2814.87s]  All right. This is fine right now. Make it a little bit bigger this way and then a little
[2814.87s -> 2821.61s]  bit bigger this way. I only have 15 grand. Period. Now, how do I like, you know, like
[2821.61s -> 2836.26s]  go like this? All right. Now I need steps to get up here. How do I just do steps this way?
[2836.26s -> 2862.44s]  Actually, I don't hate that, though. Hold on. Comma. No, I want to pitch the camera.
[2862.44s -> 2881.70s]  OK, now I need a door here. I need to put the walls up. A set button.
[2881.78s -> 2892.57s]  Use the Sims 3 camera is in the settings. Is it actually game camera? Oh, yeah.
[2892.57s -> 2896.17s]  Oh, yeah. Thank you so much. What a million times better thing to do.
[2896.17s -> 2899.77s]  That's what I was looking for. Yeah, there it is. All right. We're good.
[2899.77s -> 2903.64s]  OK, now I need to put the I need to put the walls up.
[2905.59s -> 2917.37s]  Helper Andy's. How do I put the walls up, please? It's not period. Page up and page down.
[2917.37s -> 2930.81s]  Thank you. All right. I need a door. I don't know. I don't hate that.
[2930.81s -> 2934.73s]  This is like how to get to the kitchen in a restaurant. I'm going to put that for the
[2934.73s -> 2941.42s]  kitchen door. I do have like every expansion, so there's just a ton of random doors.
[2941.42s -> 2945.94s]  Wait, wait, I need a Star Wars door. First Resistance blast door.
[2945.94s -> 2961.34s]  Now, this is lame. This is too. This is lame to start with that VIP door elevator.
[2961.34s -> 2968.74s]  It has to be something interesting, but not weird, right? How about how?
[2968.74s -> 2973.46s]  OK, that look at that. That looks all right. I need it outside.
[2973.46s -> 2983.18s]  I did. OK, I need wallpaper. All right. This is for the outside of the house.
[2983.18s -> 2997.70s]  OK, no, no, no, no. Just something solid like paint siding. Here it is. No, no.
[2997.70s -> 3012.81s]  It's a beach house. There we go. That's pretty beachy.
[3012.81s -> 3023.06s]  Yeah, I'm going to have such a cool you understand my back deck and back patio
[3023.06s -> 3025.22s]  and everything is going to be so awesome. It's going to be a huge thing.
[3025.22s -> 3030.84s]  It's going to go down. All right. So now I need to do this.
[3030.84s -> 3036.30s]  I don't know. I don't like how this looks, though. I don't care. Page down.
[3036.30s -> 3038.70s]  All right. I need to start to think about this.
[3038.70s -> 3048.14s]  You're going to walk right into the kitchen. So here we go. Let's get this blocked off.
[3048.14s -> 3051.32s]  All right. So I'm thinking kitchen is going to be boink.
[3052.28s -> 3055.32s]  Bathroom is going to be boink. Living room is going to be boink.
[3055.32s -> 3057.88s]  And bedroom is going to be boink. I think that makes sense to me.
[3058.68s -> 3061.24s]  All right. What did you say? I think that would make sense to me.
[3061.24s -> 3069.85s]  It's a Minecraft house. Yes. All right. All right. First things first.
[3069.85s -> 3072.49s]  I need to do this in order because I always do this wrong.
[3073.05s -> 3085.13s]  I need a kitchen area. Stone is a Minecraft house. It needs to be beachy.
[3085.86s -> 3093.78s]  I'm thinking, you know, yellows, oranges, blue, light blue, light blue, yellow, right?
[3093.78s -> 3101.80s]  Let's just go with the wallpaper. Just a solid color.
[3101.80s -> 3114.84s]  How do I just do a solid color? Oh, here it is. My paint.
[3114.84s -> 3119.94s]  All right. Wait, this is kind of beachy. Sandy. Yep. Look at that.
[3120.82s -> 3130.84s]  Right to about here. That looks good.
[3130.84s -> 3134.50s]  And then let's get a little bit of blue in here like this.
[3135.46s -> 3139.22s]  Okay. Remember, it's a beach house. Why is it invisible?
[3139.22s -> 3140.66s]  It's not. There's no light in here.
[3141.62s -> 3154.07s]  Okay. Dude, I'm telling you right now. Guess what's going on the wall.
[3154.71s -> 3165.59s]  Can you tell me what I'm going to put in here? I'm going to put a ship wheel on the wall.
[3165.59s -> 3172.76s]  I'm going to have a ship steering wheel on the wall. All right.
[3174.04s -> 3176.78s]  G hides the grid. Thank you. That's actually really helpful.
[3176.78s -> 3183.34s]  Floors. Floors. Floors. Floors. Floors. It's pretty beachy.
[3188.49s -> 3195.34s]  That's pretty beachy. It kind of looks like you pulled a carpet up
[3195.34s -> 3197.90s]  and that's just the wood with the glue all over it. Don't matter.
[3197.90s -> 3199.74s]  You need windows. I'm getting there. Hold on.
[3199.74s -> 3205.10s]  I have to make. Wait, I want a huge bay window looking at the water.
[3205.10s -> 3226.25s]  Can you imagine? How big can I make this?
[3226.25s -> 3233.32s]  Now that's kind of cool. That's pretty cool.
[3233.32s -> 3239.74s]  Poster house. I don't even know what that means.
[3239.74s -> 3242.54s]  You can make big objects bigger or smaller.
[3242.54s -> 3244.46s]  What the? Holy shit.
[3244.46s -> 3252.42s]  Okay. Wait a minute. I didn't know you could do that.
[3252.42s -> 3254.90s]  Oh my goodness. All right. Well, it's not going to fit.
[3254.90s -> 3259.78s]  That's insane. All right. I think that looks fine.
[3261.51s -> 3265.19s]  Now I need. We got to do the floor in here. Remember, one of the. Wait.
[3265.19s -> 3268.34s]  Where's the bathroom? Bathroom is definitely not going to be here.
[3270.38s -> 3275.70s]  A full window. No, no, no, no, no, no. Bathroom will be here.
[3276.26s -> 3289.24s]  Section that off right now. There we go.
[3289.24s -> 3293.06s]  All right. So this is, you know, the little area to kind of hang out.
[3293.06s -> 3297.70s]  Living room, bathroom, bedroom right here.
[3297.70s -> 3303.62s]  Let's do bathroom. Let's get bathroom out of the way.
[3303.62s -> 3310.25s]  I want tile tiles. I don't like tile. I like tile.
[3310.25s -> 3316.09s]  Get over it. Hmm. Beachy though.
[3316.09s -> 3317.61s]  This look. I like that. No, I don't.
[3317.61s -> 3330.82s]  It's like a public bathroom. Oh, no, that's cool.
[3330.82s -> 3335.77s]  Yeah. Now we need wallpaper for the bathroom.
[3335.77s -> 3340.78s]  What are you guys thinking? How come this Halloween music?
[3340.78s -> 3341.90s]  I don't know why this. Yeah.
[3341.90s -> 3345.32s]  It's just whatever the Sims music is cycling through right now.
[3345.32s -> 3356.89s]  Hmm. Should we tile on the wall? How about masonry?
[3356.89s -> 3359.45s]  Ooh. Yeah. It is like scary music.
[3359.45s -> 3366.12s]  It's because of the werewolf expansion turned on.
[3366.12s -> 3370.98s]  I think it's because the werewolf expansion is currently active.
[3370.98s -> 3381.54s]  I don't mind this. Look at that. That looks kind of cool.
[3381.54s -> 3385.61s]  Kind of. No. It's a solid color for now.
[3385.61s -> 3395.62s]  How about like something light? Light.
[3395.62s -> 3400.28s]  Yeah. Who cares? It doesn't matter.
[3400.28s -> 3404.12s]  All right. So that's the bathroom. This is the what should I do for this?
[3407.18s -> 3410.98s]  Fucking cop it. Oh, I want to tell you something.
[3410.98s -> 3418.36s]  So Holly and I were laughing on the couch the other day because she told me
[3419.24s -> 3421.24s]  that I have a catchphrase that I do.
[3421.24s -> 3423.80s]  I she's like, you say this all the time.
[3423.80s -> 3426.01s]  I was like, what are you talking about?
[3426.01s -> 3429.11s]  She's telling me that, hey, you know, you say that a lot.
[3429.11s -> 3431.43s]  I'm like, say what? Apparently I don't.
[3431.43s -> 3434.39s]  I have a catchphrase between me and my girlfriend that I don't even realize I have it.
[3435.54s -> 3439.86s]  And apparently I say like, oh, fucking like, garlic, garlic, kid.
[3439.86s -> 3441.22s]  Oh, yeah. Give me some fucking garlic, dude.
[3442.23s -> 3445.11s]  For no reason, apparently. And I'm like, no, there has to be a reason
[3445.11s -> 3447.03s]  of why I'm saying like, oh, fucking garlic.
[3447.03s -> 3451.99s]  I just do like a Boston accent joke and I say garlic.
[3451.99s -> 3454.47s]  But I don't I don't know why I'm saying it.
[3454.47s -> 3457.67s]  And I'm like, well, no, it's something that garlic is on screen.
[3457.67s -> 3461.43s]  You know, somebody mentions garlic. She's like, no, no, you just be sitting around.
[3461.43s -> 3463.59s]  You just look over to me and go like, oh, fucking garlic, kid.
[3464.74s -> 3467.62s]  I'm like, there's no way I do that. It's impossible.
[3467.62s -> 3474.01s]  But apparently I have a catchphrase that I did not know I had until literally two days ago.
[3474.01s -> 3476.25s]  Fucking garlic, dude. I don't know why.
[3476.25s -> 3480.09s]  And I'm like, why would I say that? She's like, I don't know.
[3480.09s -> 3486.14s]  You just do. And now that I think about it, I kind of like I kind of do that.
[3489.00s -> 3491.72s]  Oh, fucking garlic, dude. I don't know why.
[3499.26s -> 3502.95s]  No, no, not floor tiles. I actually I don't like wooden floors.
[3503.51s -> 3506.65s]  They're so noisy and it's so I hate them.
[3506.65s -> 3511.21s]  I know that's the modern thing to do right now is, oh, man, wood floors wouldn't mean authentic wood.
[3511.77s -> 3514.94s]  When you step on a wood floor, it goes like this.
[3519.13s -> 3523.50s]  Every single time you put your feet down and sometimes randomly,
[3524.57s -> 3528.41s]  randomly, you'll be lying in bed and you will hear this at four o'clock in the morning.
[3530.49s -> 3534.97s]  And go, what was that?
[3534.97s -> 3538.57s]  That just makes they just loud. It makes sounds that they could expand. I don't I hate them.
[3538.57s -> 3550.50s]  It's called slippers. It's noisy.
[3550.50s -> 3554.55s]  It's noisy and it sound bounces off of it.
[3554.55s -> 3557.59s]  I like fucking carpets, dude, just like I like garlic.
[3557.59s -> 3563.18s]  How do I turn the camera off? I forgot I redid this whole setup so I can't escape.
[3563.74s -> 3565.26s]  I have to sit here and live with what I just did.
[3569.58s -> 3571.90s]  Yeah, carpets are gross if you don't take care of them.
[3573.16s -> 3576.52s]  All you guys saying carpets smell like puke and stuff.
[3577.64s -> 3579.96s]  Are you wearing your shoes in those rooms?
[3579.96s -> 3583.80s]  Take your shoes off before you get on the carpet and vacuum it every so often.
[3583.80s -> 3590.34s]  For God sakes, if you spill an entire two liter of coke on the ground,
[3590.34s -> 3591.38s]  you're going to need to clean it.
[3591.38s -> 3594.10s]  You're going to need to get in there and clean up the carpet.
[3594.10s -> 3597.18s]  You don't just move something of rug over it.
[3599.16s -> 3602.04s]  Nah, dude, nah, you're fucked up. Every carpet smells like puke.
[3602.60s -> 3604.60s]  Did you puke on it and didn't clean it?
[3604.60s -> 3607.88s]  It's called vacuuming. It's called cleaning.
[3608.44s -> 3613.90s]  And it's called don't not wearing your shoes in the room where the carpets are.
[3617.91s -> 3620.31s]  OK, let's do carpet.
[3620.39s -> 3623.06s]  What's with all these patterns here?
[3623.06s -> 3624.74s]  Wait, why? What's with these patterns?
[3626.41s -> 3627.85s]  Oh, there it is. OK.
[3627.85s -> 3629.93s]  And I'm just going to go. We're just going to go standard.
[3629.93s -> 3633.67s]  Yeah. OK, let's get some objects.
[3633.67s -> 3642.90s]  13 grand through the kitchen.
[3642.90s -> 3644.58s]  Why is it getting weirder?
[3644.58s -> 3646.66s]  Music seems all right. I don't want to do anything too crazy.
[3649.51s -> 3651.43s]  You want to spend money on the cookware, though.
[3651.43s -> 3653.03s]  Right. So you don't burn the house down.
[3656.23s -> 3657.03s]  Oh, I need windows.
[3661.43s -> 3663.03s]  Short classic casement.
[3663.03s -> 3669.56s]  That's fine. Right.
[3669.56s -> 3673.45s]  It's classic windows.
[3673.45s -> 3675.29s]  I don't think I need a window in this room.
[3675.29s -> 3677.51s]  This whole room is a window.
[3677.51s -> 3689.34s]  Maybe one or two here.
[3689.34s -> 3695.62s]  OK, you should use Linux.
[3695.62s -> 3704.44s]  All right. This whole room is a window.
[3704.44s -> 3707.85s]  No, I'm not putting any more windows in here.
[3707.85s -> 3708.89s]  There you go. There's your window.
[3708.89s -> 3711.19s]  And we'll do a bathroom window.
[3711.19s -> 3714.10s]  Like, no, no bathroom.
[3714.10s -> 3717.62s]  All right. Here we go. Kitchen stuff.
[3717.62s -> 3719.14s]  We got the fridge. We need a stove.
[3719.14s -> 3721.29s]  I need counters, too.
[3721.29s -> 3724.49s]  Remember, the theme is beach.
[3724.49s -> 3728.36s]  I think that's a that's a decent color, too.
[3728.36s -> 3730.23s]  Do two counters.
[3730.23s -> 3732.54s]  Stove is when you sink.
[3732.54s -> 3736.07s]  So let's do stove.
[3736.07s -> 3738.95s]  I don't want to lose all my money, but this is how you burn a house down.
[3738.95s -> 3742.98s]  So I'm thinking of going with London's choice.
[3743.06s -> 3751.26s]  Ooh, this is a London's choice.
[3751.26s -> 3753.50s]  Food quality seven, power consumption, reliability.
[3753.50s -> 3755.18s]  It's been plus cooking skill.
[3755.18s -> 3756.70s]  You need lights in here. I will.
[3756.70s -> 3761.77s]  It's the best place to get light.
[3761.77s -> 3767.91s]  How do I get lights?
[3767.91s -> 3772.55s]  It's lighting its own thing.
[3772.55s -> 3780.95s]  Objects by function lighting.
[3780.95s -> 3783.86s]  OK. Oh, this. Look at that.
[3783.86s -> 3791.06s]  All right. So let's do wall lights.
[3791.06s -> 3793.38s]  I'm a big fan of just basic lighting.
[3793.38s -> 3794.50s]  I don't like chandeliers.
[3794.50s -> 3796.82s]  I feel like they're going to drop on me and crush me like a cartoon.
[3796.82s -> 3800.28s]  I don't like them. They freak me out.
[3800.28s -> 3801.56s]  I don't like anything hanging.
[3801.56s -> 3802.76s]  I don't like ceiling fans.
[3804.90s -> 3807.22s]  Ceiling fans, they they scare me.
[3807.22s -> 3810.89s]  I feel like they're going to fall and just chop me up.
[3810.89s -> 3813.37s]  Anytime I've ever had a place where it's like, oh, there's a ceiling fan
[3813.37s -> 3815.21s]  literally right above the fucking bed.
[3815.21s -> 3816.79s]  It's just like, I don't want to turn that on.
[3817.98s -> 3818.94s]  Oh, let's turn it on high.
[3819.50s -> 3822.89s]  This is a helicopter blade that's about to drop.
[3824.26s -> 3825.22s]  I don't like them.
[3825.22s -> 3830.02s]  They think they kind of freak me out, even if they're installed properly.
[3830.02s -> 3831.70s]  I don't know. It's weird to me.
[3831.70s -> 3835.19s]  I'll just try to get a fan in the corner.
[3835.19s -> 3836.87s]  It just kind of right.
[3836.87s -> 3839.62s]  You like ceiling fans. It's up to you, but I don't like shit.
[3839.62s -> 3846.09s]  I don't like any hanging objects.
[3846.09s -> 3847.45s]  There we go. This is perfect.
[3847.45s -> 3852.71s]  Should we do ceiling lights or should we do on the wall?
[3852.71s -> 3855.00s]  These are probably the best, right?
[3855.00s -> 3858.30s]  Just do like two, three cans.
[3858.30s -> 3866.09s]  Wall lights are probably. You want to see wall lights?
[3866.09s -> 3872.30s]  No, I'm not doing fluorescent lights.
[3872.30s -> 3874.30s]  Oh, look at that. That's cute.
[3874.30s -> 3875.82s]  We'll do two of these.
[3875.82s -> 3878.92s]  Where are lights usually in houses?
[3878.92s -> 3880.49s]  You would like to stop and think.
[3880.49s -> 3882.57s]  Don't look in your room and don't look in your house.
[3882.57s -> 3883.45s]  What is it? Like, where does he?
[3883.45s -> 3887.99s]  What are your little lights on your walls besides the ceiling?
[3887.99s -> 3889.91s]  Right. Forget about the ceiling.
[3889.91s -> 3891.91s]  If you have like a like a wall, a wall light.
[3891.91s -> 3896.28s]  Like, where is it? Where does it go up on the ceiling?
[3896.28s -> 3897.40s]  Yeah, but you know what I'm saying?
[3897.40s -> 3899.53s]  You know what I'm saying about that?
[3899.53s -> 3902.66s]  Like above the door, right?
[3902.66s -> 3905.14s]  With a shelf in corners.
[3905.14s -> 3909.43s]  Yeah, I'm going to go like this.
[3909.43s -> 3911.19s]  We're going to do a cute shelf here, too.
[3911.19s -> 3912.95s]  Is this painted?
[3912.95s -> 3924.50s]  Look at how charming that is.
[3924.50s -> 3928.14s]  There's 30,000 people here.
[3928.14s -> 3930.70s]  What the? There are 30. What are you doing here?
[3930.70s -> 3932.22s]  Why are there so many people here?
[3932.22s -> 3938.14s]  What's going on? Why are there so many people here?
[3938.14s -> 3940.38s]  What the fuck? These are Minecraft torches.
[3940.38s -> 3941.18s]  That's fine.
[3941.18s -> 3944.76s]  Anyways, hi. How are you doing?
[3944.76s -> 3947.18s]  It's the Among Us waiting room.
[3947.18s -> 3948.14s]  Holy shit.
[3948.14s -> 3950.42s]  Oh, welcome everybody. Hi.
[3950.42s -> 3952.84s]  All right. So that's good.
[3952.84s -> 3961.32s]  I need to sink every time I buy.
[3961.32s -> 3962.36s]  No, don't do this, right?
[3962.36s -> 3964.36s]  Everyone just goes to the top left section
[3964.36s -> 3965.96s]  as buys the top left sink.
[3965.96s -> 3968.12s]  Don't in the Sims. They break every five minutes.
[3968.12s -> 3970.09s]  It just water just shoots out of them.
[3970.09s -> 3975.54s]  Bring up some extra cash here and buy a good one.
[3975.54s -> 3976.66s]  Yeah, like this one. This one.
[3976.66s -> 3978.90s]  What? This one here is like a hundred and twenty five.
[3978.90s -> 3981.22s]  No, no, no. You got to get plenty up here.
[3981.22s -> 3984.12s]  Yeah, like this one.
[3984.12s -> 3989.19s]  See, this one's nice and modern.
[3989.19s -> 3997.13s]  Could you please say the McGriddle in the scorn voice?
[4000.52s -> 4002.68s]  I understand that you're in your editing program.
[4002.68s -> 4003.88s]  You're in like Premiere
[4003.88s -> 4006.68s]  and you're hovering over this section of the video you're editing
[4006.68s -> 4008.76s]  where you're like, fuck, I really have to get them to say this.
[4008.76s -> 4011.82s]  It's like the last thing you have to implant in the timeline.
[4011.82s -> 4014.57s]  But I mean, I'm sorry.
[4014.57s -> 4016.81s]  We just you're going to have to you're going to have to wing it.
[4016.81s -> 4018.68s]  You're going to have to wing it.
[4018.68s -> 4022.22s]  All right, that's good.
[4022.22s -> 4024.38s]  Now I need a toaster oven.
[4024.38s -> 4030.81s]  Should I do one more counter?
[4030.81s -> 4031.93s]  Yeah, just in case.
[4031.93s -> 4033.77s]  What about a dishwasher?
[4033.77s -> 4036.28s]  No, they don't. They don't use it.
[4036.28s -> 4037.88s]  Put trash over here.
[4037.88s -> 4040.76s]  But you people need to be able to come in the fucking house.
[4040.76s -> 4042.12s]  Oh, my God. I'm so dumb.
[4042.20s -> 4043.48s]  It can't be anything here.
[4043.48s -> 4047.88s]  How about like this way?
[4047.88s -> 4058.62s]  I think that's good.
[4058.62s -> 4059.42s]  Yeah, that looks fine.
[4059.42s -> 4062.22s]  And then put like, you know, a coffee maker, a toaster oven,
[4062.78s -> 4063.58s]  all the appliances.
[4063.58s -> 4064.46s]  Let's see what we got.
[4064.46s -> 4073.86s]  Should I just install a subway into that?
[4073.86s -> 4075.06s]  I feel like this would be awesome.
[4075.06s -> 4080.94s]  Can you imagine if you just woke up in the morning
[4080.94s -> 4082.54s]  and went into your kitchen
[4082.54s -> 4086.84s]  and it was just like a subway station?
[4086.84s -> 4088.44s]  Somebody has to maintain this, though.
[4088.44s -> 4100.71s]  Can I actually make food with this?
[4100.71s -> 4106.04s]  If I remove everything here except the sink?
[4106.04s -> 4107.88s]  Is this can I make food here?
[4107.88s -> 4118.18s]  It's a beach house.
[4118.18s -> 4143.03s]  It's like a vacation house.
[4143.03s -> 4144.07s]  That's all right.
[4144.07s -> 4149.80s]  I think that looks that's all right.
[4149.80s -> 4152.76s]  Put a trash can right here.
[4152.76s -> 4153.48s]  Got it. All right.
[4153.48s -> 4160.70s]  Now we need a microwave and a coffee maker.
[4160.70s -> 4166.58s]  This one seems fine, but it's coming together.
[4166.58s -> 4168.10s]  Now I need a trash can.
[4168.10s -> 4171.34s]  Just a little bin right here.
[4171.34s -> 4175.24s]  Is it too big?
[4175.24s -> 4177.13s]  What about a little one?
[4177.13s -> 4178.60s]  This one?
[4178.60s -> 4180.84s]  Come on.
[4180.84s -> 4181.40s]  Really?
[4181.40s -> 4192.58s]  I don't like this weird space here.
[4192.58s -> 4197.05s]  I hate this so much and I can't I can't fix it.
[4197.05s -> 4198.01s]  That's okay.
[4198.01s -> 4203.16s]  I don't just I don't despise that.
[4203.16s -> 4206.34s]  And then we put a little table here.
[4206.34s -> 4207.54s]  Move the door one over.
[4207.54s -> 4226.10s]  That person is smart.
[4226.10s -> 4227.22s]  Well, I didn't want to do that.
[4227.46s -> 4228.90s]  Actually, that's kind of better.
[4228.90s -> 4242.57s]  I want to pick this up and move it.
[4242.57s -> 4247.35s]  Hold alt.
[4247.35s -> 4248.15s]  Oh my God.
[4249.40s -> 4251.24s]  Wait, I could just hold the mouse button down.
[4251.24s -> 4251.80s]  All right.
[4251.80s -> 4255.34s]  So that I can put this here then.
[4255.34s -> 4265.88s]  That's definitely better right in the corner.
[4265.88s -> 4268.54s]  Door will be moved.
[4268.54s -> 4270.66s]  I can get it to move.
[4270.66s -> 4271.53s]  All right.
[4271.53s -> 4272.73s]  I got to go into build mode, right?
[4272.73s -> 4273.61s]  I am in build mode.
[4273.61s -> 4276.34s]  How do I get this to move out of here?
[4276.34s -> 4277.64s]  Oh, there we go.
[4277.64s -> 4278.12s]  Okay.
[4278.12s -> 4283.30s]  And now I want to extend this out this way.
[4283.30s -> 4289.13s]  Can I not extend this out?
[4289.13s -> 4293.08s]  Oh, that's better.
[4293.08s -> 4293.40s]  All right.
[4293.40s -> 4297.91s]  Now this moves here and the door goes right there.
[4297.91s -> 4298.62s]  Perfect.
[4298.62s -> 4299.02s]  Okay.
[4299.02s -> 4305.96s]  Good.
[4305.96s -> 4311.02s]  And then just have a bathroom door.
[4311.02s -> 4315.94s]  Oh, God damn it.
[4315.94s -> 4318.33s]  I got to delete this thing.
[4318.33s -> 4326.28s]  Do I have a big barn door?
[4326.28s -> 4332.23s]  Hey, no, we're going all night.
[4332.23s -> 4333.03s]  So don't worry.
[4333.03s -> 4334.84s]  This stream is not going to be over in like an hour.
[4334.84s -> 4335.40s]  Don't worry.
[4335.40s -> 4340.30s]  I'm down to play this.
[4340.30s -> 4340.94s]  I'm here.
[4340.94s -> 4348.36s]  I got a nice clean room.
[4348.36s -> 4350.12s]  BB move objects on.
[4350.12s -> 4351.75s]  For the love of God.
[4351.75s -> 4352.86s]  Wait, what happened?
[4352.86s -> 4354.94s]  BB dot move objects on.
[4354.94s -> 4355.90s]  It's being spammed.
[4355.90s -> 4356.94s]  What does that mean?
[4356.94s -> 4359.61s]  What does BB dot move objects on?
[4359.61s -> 4370.97s]  Control shift C.
[4370.97s -> 4371.85s]  BB.
[4371.85s -> 4373.56s]  What am I doing?
[4373.56s -> 4379.62s]  BB dot move object.
[4379.62s -> 4382.60s]  What does this do?
[4382.60s -> 4391.54s]  Move objects cheat is on.
[4391.54s -> 4395.48s]  What does it do?
[4397.99s -> 4399.59s]  Did you just fuck up my achievements?
[4399.59s -> 4401.34s]  You can place objects anywhere.
[4401.34s -> 4402.78s]  Did you just fuck up my achievements?
[4402.78s -> 4406.30s]  I can't get Xbox achievements now.
[4406.30s -> 4408.01s]  Thanks.
[4408.01s -> 4408.25s]  Okay.
[4408.25s -> 4409.05s]  Let's get back to this.
[4409.05s -> 4415.46s]  Kitchen looks good.
[4417.21s -> 4418.57s]  Now we're almost ready to get started.
[4418.57s -> 4423.51s]  Remember, you're making the shittiest house I've ever seen in Sims 4.
[4423.51s -> 4426.39s]  That is a complete fucking lie.
[4426.39s -> 4429.91s]  Considering you've watched other streams of me play this game.
[4429.91s -> 4431.27s]  And they were way worse.
[4431.27s -> 4432.55s]  There were no windows.
[4432.55s -> 4433.59s]  It was one floor.
[4434.70s -> 4435.74s]  You've seen it before.
[4435.74s -> 4437.51s]  You saw it like a year ago.
[4437.51s -> 4438.63s]  You've already seen me play this.
[4438.63s -> 4441.75s]  This is a major marketed improvement from what I was doing before.
[4441.75s -> 4445.54s]  It's still one floor.
[4445.54s -> 4447.03s]  Oh, yeah?
[4447.03s -> 4449.70s]  Wait till you see what I've learned so far.
[4449.70s -> 4449.94s]  All right.
[4449.94s -> 4450.50s]  Let's go.
[4450.50s -> 4453.72s]  What about other little things here?
[4453.72s -> 4462.14s]  Fire prevention system utility?
[4462.14s -> 4463.82s]  Gotta have like a plant.
[4463.82s -> 4471.06s]  I don't know, a bowl of fruit or whatever that is.
[4471.06s -> 4472.02s]  Who cares?
[4472.02s -> 4476.95s]  All right.
[4476.95s -> 4477.99s]  Ooh, what's this?
[4477.99s -> 4479.98s]  A basketball.
[4490.54s -> 4491.98s]  Where's the thing that I want?
[4491.98s -> 4493.02s]  The ship wheel.
[4493.02s -> 4503.35s]  What is this?
[4503.35s -> 4510.97s]  No, wheel.
[4510.97s -> 4511.53s]  What?
[4511.53s -> 4518.23s]  I have to be level four actor to buy a ship pirate wheel?
[4518.23s -> 4536.60s]  I'm putting this right over the bed.
[4536.60s -> 4549.78s]  Cheat?
[4549.78s -> 4552.09s]  No, I'm not cheating.
[4552.09s -> 4576.84s]  I'm playing this legit.
[4576.84s -> 4579.40s]  Now I need bathroom stuff.
[4579.40s -> 4580.94s]  I need a light in the bathroom too.
[4580.94s -> 4587.66s]  I forgot.
[4587.66s -> 4592.95s]  Oh, there it is.
[4592.95s -> 4594.07s]  What the fuck is that?
[4594.07s -> 4594.39s]  All right.
[4594.39s -> 4595.51s]  No, no, we're not doing that.
[4595.51s -> 4598.65s]  We'll do these.
[4598.65s -> 4599.69s]  These are kind of fine.
[4611.74s -> 4612.70s]  That's better.
[4612.70s -> 4615.13s]  Then put a mirror right there.
[4615.13s -> 4618.30s]  And then, I don't know, have something else.
[4618.30s -> 4623.40s]  I need to be an actor level four.
[4623.40s -> 4625.45s]  That shouldn't take too long, right?
[4625.45s -> 4633.05s]  All right.
[4633.05s -> 4633.85s]  There's enough light in here.
[4633.85s -> 4634.25s]  I don't care.
[4636.20s -> 4644.18s]  Now I need toilet, bathroom, toilet.
[4644.18s -> 4644.42s]  All right.
[4644.42s -> 4644.74s]  There.
[4644.74s -> 4648.07s]  So public bathroom.
[4649.51s -> 4651.21s]  I want a public bathroom.
[4651.21s -> 4651.69s]  Can I do that?
[4651.69s -> 4652.49s]  How much is this?
[4652.49s -> 4655.24s]  This is $2,700.
[4655.24s -> 4661.53s]  You have a public bathroom.
[4661.53s -> 4663.29s]  If you need to go to the bathroom, you go outside
[4663.29s -> 4664.65s]  into the public bathroom.
[4664.65s -> 4665.13s]  That's fine.
[4665.13s -> 4666.26s]  I don't care.
[4666.26s -> 4671.58s]  I don't care about wasted money.
[4671.58s -> 4673.26s]  Dude, why would I even make a bathroom?
[4673.26s -> 4675.58s]  Just put a shower in the corner or something.
[4675.58s -> 4684.60s]  Who's going to clean this?
[4684.60s -> 4686.06s]  I don't- me?
[4686.06s -> 4694.04s]  Should I even have a toilet?
[4694.04s -> 4698.57s]  I don't think I'd buy a toilet if there's a-
[4698.57s -> 4700.57s]  just like a full public bathroom over here.
[4700.57s -> 4709.37s]  I'm going to hold off for now, but I'll get a shower.
[4709.37s -> 4712.26s]  Wait, hold on.
[4712.26s -> 4716.18s]  No, I can't have- what?
[4716.18s -> 4717.46s]  Why- what is this?
[4717.46s -> 4719.62s]  This is no shower?
[4719.62s -> 4724.38s]  You just spray yourself with water in the corner?
[4724.38s -> 4725.82s]  I'm very curious.
[4725.82s -> 4727.58s]  How does this work?
[4732.87s -> 4734.31s]  I need- I need it for now.
[4734.31s -> 4737.74s]  And then we have like a bathtub running out of money.
[4737.74s -> 4749.80s]  I only have $2,800.
[4749.80s -> 4750.04s]  All right.
[4750.04s -> 4751.48s]  I got to get more essentials.
[4751.48s -> 4751.80s]  Shower?
[4751.80s -> 4752.68s]  I need a sink.
[4752.68s -> 4754.12s]  Need a mirror.
[4756.79s -> 4757.67s]  This one's fine.
[4757.67s -> 4758.79s]  Just like a little medicine cabinet.
[4758.79s -> 4759.35s]  That's fine.
[4759.35s -> 4768.55s]  I need the walls up.
[4768.55s -> 4770.22s]  Oh, not that much.
[4770.22s -> 4774.20s]  I want to put this on the other wall.
[4774.20s -> 4776.33s]  Oh, fuck it.
[4776.33s -> 4776.89s]  Who cares?
[4776.89s -> 4787.67s]  How do I make this?
[4787.67s -> 4789.03s]  How do I make this lower?
[4789.03s -> 4796.09s]  Oh, there we go.
[4796.09s -> 4806.82s]  Does this have to be this tall?
[4806.82s -> 4809.54s]  Okay.
[4809.54s -> 4810.34s]  Well, whatever.
[4810.34s -> 4816.07s]  All right. Bathroom's good.
[4816.07s -> 4818.63s]  Oh, I need a door.
[4818.63s -> 4821.21s]  I'll figure- I'll figure that out in a minute.
[4821.21s -> 4822.30s]  All right.
[4822.30s -> 4825.66s]  This is the living room slash bedroom slash hangout zone.
[4825.66s -> 4828.63s]  First of all, let's get something out of the way here.
[4828.63s -> 4829.75s]  Let's get a nice rug.
[4829.75s -> 4834.12s]  I like the frog one.
[4834.12s -> 4836.39s]  That's pretty cool.
[4836.39s -> 4849.56s]  That's pretty cool.
[4849.56s -> 4855.05s]  All right.
[4855.05s -> 4857.34s]  Don't run out of money.
[4857.34s -> 4859.10s]  Why is only half of this house-
[4859.10s -> 4861.70s]  What is going on here?
[4861.70s -> 4863.38s]  Why did it not paint the whole thing?
[4863.38s -> 4863.78s]  This-
[4863.78s -> 4864.10s]  All right.
[4864.10s -> 4864.66s]  Wait a minute.
[4864.66s -> 4869.34s]  Something's wrong here.
[4869.34s -> 4870.62s]  Oh, it's panels.
[4870.62s -> 4872.06s]  Where is it?
[4872.06s -> 4876.81s]  No, it's siding.
[4876.81s -> 4877.77s]  It's siding.
[4877.77s -> 4886.74s]  Can I not do that?
[4886.74s -> 4889.34s]  Oh, it just looks so weird.
[4889.34s -> 4889.66s]  Okay.
[4889.66s -> 4890.54s]  That was weird.
[4890.54s -> 4891.86s]  Doesn't it look like the same thing?
[4891.86s -> 4892.50s]  Is it the sunlight?
[4892.50s -> 4893.77s]  All right.
[4893.77s -> 4894.41s]  I need a roof.
[4894.41s -> 4896.09s]  Everyone will yell at me if I don't make one.
[4896.09s -> 4899.05s]  What kind of roof?
[4899.05s -> 4913.51s]  Does this cost money?
[4913.51s -> 4931.48s]  Make it so it only-
[4931.48s -> 4945.05s]  You bet your ass.
[4945.05s -> 4947.37s]  I put a fucking shitload of solar panels on this thing.
[4947.37s -> 4952.26s]  Just make sure-
[4952.26s -> 4953.78s]  Aim it directly to the sun.
[4953.78s -> 4956.55s]  Are there solar panels?
[4969.56s -> 4970.76s]  What if I'm going to flip it?
[4970.76s -> 4972.68s]  Actually, it wouldn't look so weird if it was flipped.
[4972.68s -> 4975.86s]  And then shrink it.
[4975.86s -> 4997.58s]  They were building two different houses when they got here.
[4997.58s -> 4997.82s]  All right.
[4997.82s -> 4998.22s]  No, no, no.
[4998.22s -> 4998.94s]  This is wrong.
[4998.94s -> 5000.12s]  Let's get rid of this.
[5000.12s -> 5011.34s]  I want it to look cool,
[5011.34s -> 5025.53s]  but I don't want it to be stupid looking.
[5025.53s -> 5026.17s]  Oh my.
[5026.17s -> 5032.50s]  Whatever.
[5032.50s -> 5033.30s]  That's not bad.
[5033.30s -> 5038.50s]  It just needs to be smaller.
[5038.50s -> 5046.28s]  Is it going into the house?
[5046.28s -> 5046.60s]  Wait.
[5046.60s -> 5048.20s]  The roof is going into the house.
[5048.20s -> 5053.32s]  This is wrong.
[5053.32s -> 5058.15s]  My god.
[5058.15s -> 5058.47s]  Whatever.
[5058.47s -> 5060.07s]  Just do a fucking regular ass roof.
[5060.07s -> 5060.79s]  Who cares?
[5060.79s -> 5077.90s]  Dude, no one even sees this.
[5077.90s -> 5080.71s]  No one even sees this.
[5080.71s -> 5081.75s]  It's never shown.
[5081.75s -> 5084.87s]  It just has to exist.
[5084.87s -> 5086.07s]  So who cares?
[5086.07s -> 5087.03s]  It's never shown.
[5087.03s -> 5088.23s]  It just needs to exist.
[5088.23s -> 5093.48s]  That doesn't matter.
[5093.48s -> 5094.20s]  It exists.
[5094.20s -> 5097.66s]  That's the only thing that matters.
[5097.66s -> 5098.86s]  If it exists.
[5098.86s -> 5101.26s]  I just heard my girlfriend laugh at me.
[5101.26s -> 5102.14s]  I heard her laugh.
[5102.14s -> 5103.10s]  I heard her.
[5103.10s -> 5103.74s]  I could hear it.
[5104.66s -> 5105.14s]  I heard it.
[5112.55s -> 5114.55s]  The movement sheets are fucking everything up.
[5114.55s -> 5117.35s]  I told you I didn't want my Xbox achievements to be messed up.
[5121.67s -> 5122.55s]  It's fine.
[5122.55s -> 5122.79s]  All right.
[5122.79s -> 5123.91s]  I just need to paint the outside.
[5126.58s -> 5131.59s]  Siding.
[5131.59s -> 5132.07s]  Look it.
[5132.07s -> 5132.87s]  It's fine.
[5134.26s -> 5134.82s]  It's fine.
[5136.79s -> 5137.59s]  It was an addition.
[5138.23s -> 5139.35s]  Place things better.
[5140.15s -> 5141.03s]  A lot of architect.
[5144.34s -> 5144.98s]  Okay.
[5144.98s -> 5145.86s]  So let's get in here.
[5147.00s -> 5147.88s]  Page down.
[5147.88s -> 5148.20s]  No.
[5148.20s -> 5149.24s]  Excuse me.
[5149.24s -> 5150.90s]  Excuse me.
[5150.90s -> 5151.88s]  There we go.
[5151.88s -> 5152.36s]  All right.
[5152.36s -> 5153.88s]  So now I got bathroom set.
[5153.88s -> 5156.92s]  I just need to do just a little bit of entertainment and a bed and I'm done.
[5156.92s -> 5158.55s]  We can add to it later.
[5161.72s -> 5163.24s]  I just want a huge bed.
[5163.24s -> 5165.75s]  Can I make this like a quad?
[5171.93s -> 5172.33s]  Okay.
[5172.33s -> 5174.81s]  I kind of want the gigantic fucking bed.
[5176.65s -> 5178.65s]  How does somebody sleep in this thing?
[5178.65s -> 5181.59s]  Do they actually get in here and sleep in it?
[5186.12s -> 5187.16s]  I don't.
[5187.16s -> 5187.88s]  How?
[5187.88s -> 5192.89s]  That's a man-sized bed.
[5196.28s -> 5197.80s]  What happened to the stairs?
[5202.10s -> 5202.82s]  Excuse me.
[5204.63s -> 5205.59s]  Why did that happen?
[5208.20s -> 5210.12s]  There's no explanation for why that happened.
[5210.12s -> 5213.90s]  That's a man-sized bed.
[5215.50s -> 5216.30s]  All right.
[5216.30s -> 5217.34s]  I'm almost ready to start.
[5217.34s -> 5219.18s]  Any of the necessities that I need.
[5219.18s -> 5221.22s]  Maybe a TV, right?
[5221.78s -> 5222.50s]  Television.
[5222.50s -> 5223.46s]  Just a TV to have.
[5230.62s -> 5231.18s]  Just to have it.
[5231.18s -> 5231.34s]  All right.
[5231.34s -> 5232.54s]  I have 300 bucks.
[5232.54s -> 5233.10s]  It's time to go.
[5233.10s -> 5233.58s]  Let's play.
[5234.70s -> 5235.58s]  Bingo.
[5235.58s -> 5236.98s]  Start the game.
[5236.98s -> 5238.74s]  Here we are.
[5238.74s -> 5242.94s]  How are we going?
[5243.50s -> 5243.74s]  Hold on.
[5243.74s -> 5245.18s]  I got to turn it up a little.
[5245.18s -> 5246.89s]  It's a little low.
[5247.45s -> 5251.37s]  Oh my god.
[5251.37s -> 5255.61s]  I have to save this.
[5255.61s -> 5256.09s]  All right.
[5256.09s -> 5257.13s]  So what's this guy's name?
[5259.02s -> 5260.46s]  Lord McNulty.
[5260.46s -> 5263.30s]  Where am I going?
[5263.30s -> 5264.58s]  Chat with Jace.
[5264.58s -> 5266.54s]  What do I need?
[5266.54s -> 5267.50s]  Where are my needs?
[5267.50s -> 5272.09s]  Where am I going?
[5277.03s -> 5278.15s]  He's going to shoot me with a cannon.
[5280.14s -> 5282.86s]  So my house is right next to like a playground?
[5282.86s -> 5286.54s]  I've been to the Flaxfire Outpost on Batu.
[5287.74s -> 5288.38s]  I missed the text.
[5289.83s -> 5291.11s]  When you're ready to head to Batu,
[5291.11s -> 5293.27s]  click on your phone and select take a vacation.
[5293.27s -> 5294.23s]  And select Batu.
[5298.78s -> 5299.34s]  All right.
[5299.34s -> 5300.30s]  What do you want to do?
[5300.30s -> 5303.75s]  Play video games and listen to kids music.
[5303.75s -> 5304.55s]  Oh, well, this is...
[5318.07s -> 5319.98s]  Leave there, please.
[5319.98s -> 5321.26s]  Listen to kids music.
[5321.26s -> 5323.91s]  Wait, can I play on this stuff?
[5323.91s -> 5325.29s]  No, you can't.
[5325.29s -> 5326.49s]  Wait, I can.
[5326.49s -> 5327.29s]  I'm not doing that.
[5329.83s -> 5331.77s]  Fuck out of here.
[5331.77s -> 5332.33s]  I'm going up.
[5333.05s -> 5336.20s]  Why does he want to listen to kids music?
[5339.10s -> 5339.82s]  I should have waited.
[5339.82s -> 5341.90s]  Listen to kids music be one of his aspirations.
[5341.90s -> 5346.82s]  There's no bathroom door.
[5347.62s -> 5349.82s]  I got it.
[5349.82s -> 5355.64s]  He's got a bathroom.
[5355.64s -> 5358.44s]  He's got an old public bathroom down there.
[5358.44s -> 5362.44s]  All right.
[5362.44s -> 5363.16s]  You're good.
[5363.16s -> 5364.14s]  Let's go.
[5364.14s -> 5365.72s]  All right.
[5365.72s -> 5366.92s]  So first things first.
[5366.92s -> 5368.84s]  Where's the dog?
[5368.84s -> 5369.08s]  All right.
[5369.08s -> 5369.96s]  What are you up to?
[5369.96s -> 5375.21s]  You doing all right?
[5375.21s -> 5376.97s]  Give a $10 treat.
[5376.97s -> 5380.33s]  Can you not?
[5380.97s -> 5381.69s]  Oh, that's right.
[5381.69s -> 5384.44s]  I don't have the mod that means you can play as the pet.
[5384.44s -> 5384.76s]  Okay.
[5384.76s -> 5387.98s]  So let's go talk.
[5387.98s -> 5389.18s]  Let's go get to know the dog.
[5389.18s -> 5390.47s]  I think that's a good idea.
[5390.47s -> 5405.32s]  All right.
[5405.32s -> 5407.80s]  So I do want to go do the Star Wars thing because that's an aspiration.
[5408.92s -> 5410.44s]  Actually, I need to get a job first.
[5410.44s -> 5415.67s]  Do you actually use the public bathroom?
[5415.67s -> 5419.88s]  How do I make it go fast without having to click down here?
[5419.88s -> 5422.60s]  Is there a certain button combination?
[5422.60s -> 5431.46s]  Of all the expansions laughing my ass off, you're going to play Batuu.
[5431.46s -> 5437.88s]  Is that something wrong with that?
[5437.88s -> 5443.58s]  Friend.
[5443.58s -> 5443.90s]  Friendly.
[5443.90s -> 5444.38s]  Okay.
[5444.38s -> 5445.26s]  Who are you?
[5447.16s -> 5449.72s]  This is Hillary Lawrence.
[5449.72s -> 5450.36s]  Neighbor.
[5450.36s -> 5453.77s]  Should we talk about Star Wars?
[5457.59s -> 5459.80s]  I need to play video games.
[5459.80s -> 5460.60s]  Do you have any video games?
[5462.02s -> 5463.06s]  I hear a DS on you.
[5470.33s -> 5471.21s]  Is it really that bad?
[5472.41s -> 5473.05s]  Move the cam.
[5474.30s -> 5475.82s]  Oh, it's covering the needs.
[5475.82s -> 5476.30s]  You're it.
[5476.30s -> 5476.78s]  Yeah.
[5476.78s -> 5478.39s]  Should I put it up here?
[5478.39s -> 5480.78s]  I'm going to flip it horizontally.
[5480.78s -> 5481.90s]  People are going to freak out.
[5481.90s -> 5489.37s]  People are going to lose their minds right now.
[5492.04s -> 5493.24s]  No, no, no.
[5493.24s -> 5494.20s]  Top right.
[5494.20s -> 5499.64s]  Top right has info on it, though.
[5499.64s -> 5501.34s]  There's no information on the top left.
[5501.34s -> 5502.39s]  This is fine.
[5502.39s -> 5503.51s]  I'm just going to be flipped.
[5506.25s -> 5506.89s]  Oh, what'd you bring?
[5508.90s -> 5510.18s]  Gourmet fruitcake.
[5511.78s -> 5513.86s]  Why is everybody showing up right now?
[5515.48s -> 5516.28s]  You don't have to knock on the door.
[5516.28s -> 5516.84s]  We're standing.
[5516.84s -> 5517.72s]  Welcome to the neighborhood.
[5517.72s -> 5518.28s]  How do I eat that?
[5519.35s -> 5519.67s]  All right.
[5519.67s -> 5520.55s]  Invite everybody in.
[5520.55s -> 5521.03s]  Come on in.
[5521.59s -> 5523.10s]  Have you seen my dog, Yodel?
[5526.54s -> 5527.18s]  Everybody come on in.
[5532.02s -> 5533.38s]  This is a hazard.
[5533.46s -> 5535.14s]  Somebody could literally fall and break their ankle.
[5535.94s -> 5536.90s]  Please get in.
[5536.90s -> 5537.62s]  This is a hazard.
[5537.62s -> 5538.66s]  There's no handrails.
[5539.22s -> 5540.66s]  Someone's going to fall down and get hurt.
[5543.64s -> 5543.96s]  All right.
[5543.96s -> 5544.76s]  Say hello.
[5544.76s -> 5545.24s]  Come on in.
[5548.44s -> 5549.32s]  Where'd that fruitcake go?
[5549.88s -> 5552.47s]  Where's the fruitcake?
[5555.91s -> 5557.67s]  I don't have a fruitcake in my inventory.
[5557.67s -> 5562.12s]  Give it to me.
[5562.12s -> 5562.60s]  Where is it?
[5565.40s -> 5566.60s]  Pet obsessions.
[5566.60s -> 5567.56s]  Like almost all pets,
[5567.56s -> 5569.48s]  Yodel can get inexplicably obsessed
[5569.48s -> 5570.52s]  about things around the house.
[5570.52s -> 5571.88s]  Keep an eye on your furry companion.
[5571.88s -> 5572.76s]  What are you obsessed with?
[5572.76s -> 5573.40s]  A fridge?
[5575.64s -> 5576.28s]  Oh, there it is.
[5577.40s -> 5577.96s]  I'm going to put this up.
[5577.96s -> 5579.00s]  Yeah, I'm going to eat this later.
[5579.64s -> 5581.08s]  Why is he obsessed with the fridge?
[5584.68s -> 5585.58s]  Okay.
[5585.58s -> 5586.70s]  So I can eat that later.
[5589.26s -> 5590.78s]  Anybody know how to welcome wagon?
[5590.78s -> 5591.82s]  Oh, that's what it is.
[5596.74s -> 5598.10s]  Should I hire staff?
[5598.10s -> 5599.70s]  I'm going to serve brunch.
[5600.82s -> 5601.46s]  Eggs and toast.
[5601.46s -> 5602.18s]  How does this work?
[5602.18s -> 5603.70s]  Is it actually like a subway station?
[5608.98s -> 5610.18s]  This is actually dangerous.
[5611.38s -> 5611.94s]  Chorg.
[5612.58s -> 5613.30s]  Wixana.
[5613.30s -> 5614.02s]  Sarpah.
[5614.02s -> 5614.74s]  Yabba too.
[5615.54s -> 5616.34s]  Wanjini.
[5616.34s -> 5616.98s]  What am I making?
[5620.10s -> 5621.46s]  Holy shit, dude.
[5621.46s -> 5621.94s]  Relax.
[5628.42s -> 5630.42s]  Where's the herbs and cheese bread, man?
[5630.42s -> 5630.90s]  Come on.
[5631.78s -> 5633.30s]  Where's the Italians herbs and cheese?
[5642.20s -> 5643.40s]  Yodel is an active dog.
[5643.40s -> 5644.68s]  They will frequently run around.
[5645.24s -> 5646.23s]  Where'd you go?
[5646.87s -> 5648.33s]  Stay out of there.
[5649.78s -> 5650.34s]  Wait.
[5650.34s -> 5650.90s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[5650.90s -> 5652.02s]  I thought I was controlling the dog.
[5657.96s -> 5658.52s]  Wait.
[5658.52s -> 5659.48s]  Oh, I have a cooking skill.
[5661.32s -> 5662.04s]  You don't like dogs.
[5666.76s -> 5669.00s]  This shit is a fucking bad hole.
[5681.00s -> 5681.80s]  Wait, did I save it?
[5696.09s -> 5696.59s]  No.
[5697.69s -> 5698.73s]  Somebody help.
[5698.73s -> 5700.25s]  What are you standing there for?
[5700.25s -> 5701.69s]  You psychos.
[5701.69s -> 5703.05s]  Somebody help me.
[5703.05s -> 5704.01s]  I'm the new neighbor.
[5704.57s -> 5705.69s]  I'm the new neighbor.
[5710.52s -> 5711.16s]  What do I do?
[5712.04s -> 5712.92s]  Put yourself out.
[5712.92s -> 5713.42s]  Quick.
[5727.77s -> 5728.57s]  Am I alive?
[5730.87s -> 5731.27s]  Okay.
[5731.83s -> 5732.47s]  What happened?
[5733.11s -> 5737.02s]  Holy fucking moly.
[5738.23s -> 5739.11s]  I just got money.
[5739.11s -> 5739.91s]  Who is this guy?
[5743.32s -> 5745.80s]  Did I fuck up my entire house already?
[5745.80s -> 5749.90s]  Would he just take out green sludge out of this?
[5750.46s -> 5753.37s]  Why did you just empty a whole can of peas?
[5753.37s -> 5753.93s]  Who are you?
[5753.93s -> 5754.81s]  Why are you in my house?
[5758.58s -> 5760.18s]  I'm venting about this.
[5762.18s -> 5763.30s]  Why would you eat?
[5763.30s -> 5764.50s]  What is the peas for?
[5764.50s -> 5765.78s]  You brought peas?
[5770.17s -> 5771.29s]  You're a lunatic.
[5771.29s -> 5774.62s]  If you bring a bowl of peas to somebody's house.
[5774.62s -> 5775.82s]  Just unprompted.
[5775.82s -> 5776.38s]  Oh, yeah.
[5776.38s -> 5777.18s]  Welcome to the neighborhood.
[5777.18s -> 5778.70s]  I dumped a can of peas in here.
[5781.74s -> 5782.78s]  Can I clean up?
[5785.38s -> 5786.90s]  Who's screaming?
[5790.46s -> 5791.10s]  Do you hear that?
[5797.80s -> 5799.24s]  Oh, you turned the TV on.
[5799.24s -> 5799.48s]  Okay.
[5801.91s -> 5804.38s]  Well, this is obviously destroyed.
[5804.38s -> 5805.18s]  That's great.
[5805.18s -> 5805.50s]  All right.
[5809.34s -> 5810.62s]  Fear of fire.
[5810.62s -> 5812.38s]  I wonder why he has a fear of fire.
[5813.74s -> 5814.30s]  No shit.
[5818.74s -> 5819.06s]  Okay.
[5819.70s -> 5821.86s]  We need to get this sorted.
[5821.86s -> 5824.26s]  First of all, I'm annoyed that you brought him here,
[5824.26s -> 5825.38s]  but I'm going to eat the peas.
[5826.02s -> 5827.51s]  Exy.
[5837.48s -> 5838.28s]  This is so weird.
[5839.80s -> 5840.84s]  I am burnt.
[5843.88s -> 5845.48s]  And nobody's checking on it.
[5845.48s -> 5846.44s]  Nobody's caring.
[5847.72s -> 5848.60s]  Send them home.
[5848.60s -> 5850.04s]  Well, I need to make friends in the neighborhood.
[5853.37s -> 5855.05s]  Yeah, I'm the guy that invited everybody over.
[5855.05s -> 5855.77s]  A new neighbor.
[5856.57s -> 5859.45s]  And burnt his house down with a fucking grilled cheese.
[5859.45s -> 5860.09s]  Whatever that was.
[5860.09s -> 5861.13s]  I don't even know what that was.
[5861.13s -> 5862.01s]  Eggs or toast?
[5869.05s -> 5869.93s]  I have to delete this stuff, though.
[5869.93s -> 5872.09s]  Because should I replace the floor?
[5876.23s -> 5877.59s]  Dude, that's what happens when you just jam.
[5880.86s -> 5881.58s]  God damn it.
[5881.58s -> 5882.46s]  How do I fix this?
[5882.46s -> 5884.06s]  Do I have to clean that?
[5885.75s -> 5886.71s]  You need a dog bowl?
[5887.83s -> 5888.31s]  Oh, fuck.
[5888.31s -> 5888.63s]  You're right.
[5888.63s -> 5888.87s]  Okay.
[5889.67s -> 5892.14s]  Do I have to replace the floor?
[5892.86s -> 5895.90s]  Just put a big rug there.
[5895.90s -> 5897.02s]  No, I have to replace the floor.
[5897.66s -> 5909.94s]  Probably like head hurts.
[5909.94s -> 5911.14s]  That was so fucking funny.
[5912.23s -> 5912.47s]  Okay.
[5915.69s -> 5916.89s]  What even is the floor here?
[5917.45s -> 5920.26s]  Which one of these?
[5920.26s -> 5920.82s]  I don't remember.
[5923.00s -> 5925.53s]  DIY job.
[5926.25s -> 5926.57s]  Sorry.
[5931.78s -> 5932.74s]  No, I don't have a stove.
[5932.74s -> 5933.62s]  Let me clean up first.
[5935.62s -> 5941.21s]  I'm going to take a thoughtful shower after that.
[5944.46s -> 5945.50s]  Extinguish fire.
[5948.42s -> 5948.74s]  Weird.
[5956.57s -> 5958.01s]  Is this going to come out?
[5969.74s -> 5971.18s]  People can see you.
[5971.18s -> 5971.42s]  What?
[5972.46s -> 5973.42s]  Because of this window.
[5975.32s -> 5975.72s]  Can you?
[5975.72s -> 5976.36s]  No, you can't.
[5982.42s -> 5982.74s]  All right.
[5982.74s -> 5984.18s]  I'll fix that a little bit later.
[5986.74s -> 5987.30s]  All right.
[5987.30s -> 5987.94s]  So I need to...
[5989.75s -> 5990.23s]  What's wrong?
[5992.15s -> 5993.19s]  You want to play?
[5993.19s -> 5993.59s]  All right.
[5995.83s -> 5996.87s]  I need a dog bowl.
[5999.94s -> 6001.46s]  You're just going to be permanently scared.
[6001.46s -> 6002.26s]  I probably am.
[6003.22s -> 6004.18s]  That was ridiculous.
[6005.14s -> 6006.34s]  I've never seen that happen before.
[6008.95s -> 6011.59s]  The first literally one minute of playing the game.
[6012.23s -> 6016.38s]  If you don't have a subway station for a stove
[6016.38s -> 6018.54s]  and get a guy that's never cooked before
[6018.54s -> 6019.98s]  to go pretend to be a chef on it.
[6022.23s -> 6022.47s]  Okay.
[6023.83s -> 6024.63s]  I need a dog bowl.
[6025.27s -> 6030.14s]  Where would that be?
[6032.76s -> 6033.32s]  Bedroom?
[6035.08s -> 6035.48s]  Oh, wait.
[6035.48s -> 6035.64s]  Okay.
[6035.64s -> 6036.04s]  Here we go.
[6036.60s -> 6038.42s]  So here we go.
[6040.60s -> 6041.56s]  Is this a cat bowl?
[6042.20s -> 6043.32s]  No, this is a dog bowl.
[6043.32s -> 6049.35s]  This would be right here.
[6049.35s -> 6049.67s]  It's good.
[6050.23s -> 6050.73s]  All right.
[6053.59s -> 6054.87s]  Are you scared for life?
[6054.87s -> 6055.51s]  I don't know.
[6055.51s -> 6056.23s]  How long does it last?
[6057.43s -> 6058.31s]  57 minutes.
[6058.31s -> 6058.79s]  That's not bad.
[6061.13s -> 6062.49s]  Oh, somebody filled that?
[6063.69s -> 6064.57s]  When do you guys fill the bowl?
[6069.10s -> 6070.14s]  I'm inspired.
[6070.14s -> 6075.32s]  Ooh, maybe next time.
[6076.74s -> 6077.38s]  What does it say?
[6077.94s -> 6079.21s]  Oh, there we go.
[6079.21s -> 6079.53s]  I'm good.
[6080.17s -> 6080.89s]  What's my problem?
[6081.45s -> 6083.98s]  What's going on?
[6083.98s -> 6085.10s]  What's my problem?
[6085.10s -> 6085.90s]  Maybe next time.
[6088.30s -> 6088.62s]  All right.
[6090.68s -> 6091.88s]  Fill and call yodel.
[6096.42s -> 6097.30s]  Oh, I need a trash.
[6099.32s -> 6101.56s]  Where is my actual outdoor trash?
[6101.56s -> 6102.12s]  Do I have one?
[6103.77s -> 6104.09s]  Okay.
[6104.09s -> 6107.18s]  I need a trash can and I needed a stove.
[6107.18s -> 6111.40s]  Can I even afford a stove?
[6111.40s -> 6112.12s]  I can.
[6112.12s -> 6112.52s]  All right.
[6112.52s -> 6113.56s]  This time don't be an idiot.
[6119.18s -> 6119.74s]  Okay.
[6120.30s -> 6122.65s]  What else was over here besides the stove?
[6122.65s -> 6124.49s]  I think anything else damaged?
[6124.49s -> 6126.10s]  This shit's so fucked up.
[6126.10s -> 6126.90s]  This stuff's damaged.
[6127.54s -> 6129.53s]  This is damaged.
[6130.17s -> 6145.96s]  Okay.
[6145.96s -> 6147.16s]  Now I just want new counters.
[6155.18s -> 6155.82s]  What?
[6155.82s -> 6158.78s]  Look at these.
[6158.78s -> 6159.42s]  Look at these.
[6159.42s -> 6160.86s]  Look at the difference.
[6160.86s -> 6161.90s]  Why is this one so screwed up?
[6167.51s -> 6168.39s]  These ones are burnt.
[6169.72s -> 6170.04s]  What?
[6171.50s -> 6172.46s]  Oh, okay.
[6172.46s -> 6172.94s]  Well, whatever.
[6173.50s -> 6178.94s]  That's fine.
[6178.94s -> 6180.78s]  Let's get this stuff back on the right counters.
[6181.66s -> 6182.30s]  What do I just do?
[6182.94s -> 6188.81s]  Okay.
[6188.81s -> 6192.14s]  Coffee maker.
[6193.02s -> 6194.22s]  I need that microwave back.
[6195.02s -> 6199.83s]  That's fine.
[6200.47s -> 6203.14s]  And then I get just a little place to serve.
[6203.86s -> 6205.14s]  And now I need a trash can.
[6205.78s -> 6206.34s]  That's better.
[6207.43s -> 6207.83s]  All right.
[6207.83s -> 6210.95s]  Nice trash right here is good.
[6211.75s -> 6213.56s]  And it's this way.
[6214.36s -> 6216.63s]  How do I make it so it doesn't do this?
[6217.19s -> 6219.78s]  I thought I had that cheat code on.
[6223.45s -> 6224.09s]  Alt.
[6224.09s -> 6225.03s]  Okay.
[6225.03s -> 6225.35s]  Thank you.
[6227.37s -> 6227.77s]  Okay.
[6228.33s -> 6228.97s]  Back to normal.
[6229.61s -> 6231.77s]  What do I have to go to the...
[6231.77s -> 6232.73s]  I have to go to Batu.
[6235.19s -> 6235.59s]  All right.
[6235.59s -> 6238.12s]  We got notebook.
[6238.12s -> 6240.20s]  There are no entries in Blorg's notebook.
[6240.92s -> 6241.32s]  Blorg.
[6242.60s -> 6243.08s]  Allender.
[6243.08s -> 6243.32s]  All right.
[6243.32s -> 6243.88s]  What's coming up?
[6247.80s -> 6248.52s]  Well, this is today.
[6248.52s -> 6249.16s]  Add event, right?
[6249.16s -> 6249.32s]  Yeah.
[6250.04s -> 6252.30s]  Well, I was going to write like...
[6252.30s -> 6253.66s]  I got it like burnt.
[6259.83s -> 6260.63s]  Winterfest.
[6263.77s -> 6264.33s]  Ooh.
[6264.33s -> 6264.57s]  All right.
[6264.57s -> 6265.85s]  Where's Winterfest?
[6265.85s -> 6267.54s]  From 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.
[6268.26s -> 6269.53s]  Wait.
[6269.53s -> 6270.41s]  It's right now.
[6270.41s -> 6270.65s]  Wait.
[6270.65s -> 6271.53s]  Father Winter.
[6271.53s -> 6273.37s]  Santa Claus is coming in three days.
[6274.17s -> 6281.72s]  I have to do festive stuff.
[6281.72s -> 6282.60s]  I'm going to throw a party.
[6283.16s -> 6291.58s]  I'm going to be ready to throw a party.
[6291.58s -> 6292.70s]  Can I go in the water?
[6299.54s -> 6301.38s]  Am I going to take my clothes off?
[6301.38s -> 6303.38s]  And excuse me.
[6304.18s -> 6305.14s]  Excuse me.
[6314.68s -> 6315.00s]  Yeah.
[6316.04s -> 6316.52s]  Uh-uh.
[6317.08s -> 6317.56s]  Uh-uh.
[6318.44s -> 6319.08s]  Uh-uh.
[6319.08s -> 6319.32s]  Go.
[6320.44s -> 6324.68s]  This is...
[6324.68s -> 6328.33s]  I get in the...
[6328.33s -> 6329.05s]  Go in the water.
[6329.05s -> 6329.53s]  Go in the water.
[6329.53s -> 6330.17s]  Hurry the fuck up.
[6330.17s -> 6331.05s]  Get in the fucking water, please.
[6332.57s -> 6333.77s]  Oh, my God.
[6333.77s -> 6337.13s]  I didn't think he was going to walk out the front door naked.
[6337.85s -> 6339.38s]  Did he pee?
[6340.02s -> 6343.43s]  What are you doing?
[6345.99s -> 6347.03s]  Go jogging.
[6348.39s -> 6349.99s]  No, he's not going to go jogging like this.
[6354.71s -> 6356.31s]  Bro, you've got to be kidding me.
[6356.95s -> 6358.87s]  You've actually got to be fucking kidding me.
[6375.99s -> 6377.43s]  Go home.
[6377.43s -> 6378.39s]  Go home.
[6379.03s -> 6380.15s]  Go home.
[6380.15s -> 6381.43s]  What is wrong with you?
[6386.20s -> 6387.00s]  Who is this?
[6387.56s -> 6393.34s]  Hello?
[6393.34s -> 6394.38s]  I'm going to introduce...
[6394.38s -> 6395.66s]  Wait, is this a famous person?
[6396.22s -> 6397.74s]  Ask for a selfie.
[6397.74s -> 6403.56s]  What are you doing?
[6403.56s -> 6404.44s]  What are you calling?
[6404.44s -> 6406.26s]  Who is she calling?
[6406.26s -> 6411.85s]  You need entertainment, dude.
[6411.85s -> 6412.57s]  Where did I go?
[6417.02s -> 6417.58s]  Get over there.
[6429.22s -> 6430.26s]  Sol Sol!
[6430.26s -> 6431.14s]  What's up, buddy?
[6431.14s -> 6434.10s]  That's not how I would not introduce myself to a celebrity like that.
[6434.10s -> 6435.30s]  I'd just be like, hey, what's up?
[6435.30s -> 6435.80s]  Bro.
[6438.26s -> 6438.76s]  Okay.
[6439.70s -> 6440.98s]  Global superstar.
[6445.11s -> 6448.46s]  Did I have an autograph?
[6449.18s -> 6453.45s]  Who asked for a P.A., Floymo?
[6454.33s -> 6454.83s]  Me.
[6456.81s -> 6457.29s]  No?
[6457.29s -> 6457.93s]  Oh, okay.
[6458.57s -> 6460.06s]  What about...
[6460.06s -> 6460.70s]  Can I take a picture?
[6460.70s -> 6461.42s]  Can we have a picture?
[6462.14s -> 6463.26s]  Oh, Pernosa.
[6463.26s -> 6464.46s]  Can I have a marathon?
[6464.46s -> 6465.10s]  Oh, Espanol.
[6465.10s -> 6465.66s]  Damn.
[6465.66s -> 6466.86s]  Oh, I need Espanol.
[6468.57s -> 6474.30s]  Um, what else?
[6474.78s -> 6475.58s]  All right, well, bye.
[6477.02s -> 6477.58s]  I can't just...
[6481.98s -> 6483.42s]  Thank God the fire is out.
[6483.42s -> 6483.92s]  Oh.
[6486.54s -> 6487.26s]  You too.
[6488.06s -> 6492.63s]  All right, what's wrong with me?
[6496.28s -> 6498.20s]  Oh, you're obsessed with the fridge.
[6500.54s -> 6501.04s]  I forgot.
[6504.86s -> 6505.36s]  Yipsy.
[6507.42s -> 6512.06s]  There's been a couple of partly unhinged things going on the first 20 minutes of this game.
[6512.06s -> 6513.66s]  We're going to try to dial it back a little.
[6519.08s -> 6520.60s]  So, I need bladder.
[6523.62s -> 6524.68s]  Hunger.
[6524.76s -> 6525.08s]  Don't...
[6525.08s -> 6527.40s]  This time, I'm eating a snack.
[6527.40s -> 6528.84s]  I'm eating a microwaved meal.
[6528.84s -> 6530.92s]  We're not touching the stove for a little while.
[6531.80s -> 6535.22s]  We're gonna have microwaved chicken nuggets.
[6541.85s -> 6544.09s]  Like, the worst way to make chicken nuggets.
[6544.09s -> 6553.37s]  That's the worst possible way to do that.
[6553.37s -> 6554.41s]  He needs a new...
[6554.41s -> 6554.91s]  Okay.
[6558.81s -> 6560.09s]  So, let's do energy.
[6561.27s -> 6563.98s]  Maybe.
[6563.98s -> 6565.26s]  Oh, right, this huge bed.
[6565.82s -> 6578.01s]  Can I actually get in it?
[6578.01s -> 6578.33s]  You can't...
[6578.33s -> 6580.17s]  This is not gonna have a problem, right?
[6580.17s -> 6581.45s]  It's just microwave chicken nuggets.
[6582.79s -> 6585.78s]  You know where to sit and eat?
[6585.78s -> 6587.03s]  It's okay.
[6587.03s -> 6587.83s]  I only have 300 bucks.
[6587.83s -> 6588.55s]  I need to get a job.
[6588.55s -> 6589.75s]  I need to make money somehow.
[6590.39s -> 6596.47s]  For a second, I thought that was the fire alarm.
[6596.47s -> 6597.51s]  No, you can't have any.
[6602.25s -> 6603.13s]  Oh, they suck.
[6603.77s -> 6605.43s]  He hates it.
[6605.99s -> 6610.26s]  Okay.
[6610.26s -> 6619.32s]  Now, why would you do that?
[6619.32s -> 6619.96s]  That's just weird.
[6619.96s -> 6620.92s]  That was weird.
[6620.92s -> 6625.26s]  That was very weird.
[6625.26s -> 6627.42s]  Who smells their chicken nuggets like that?
[6627.42s -> 6629.18s]  All right.
[6629.18s -> 6630.06s]  Let's fill the dog bowl.
[6631.03s -> 6633.27s]  This is why I didn't want like 10 cats, guys.
[6633.27s -> 6635.83s]  Because you have to do this.
[6635.83s -> 6641.18s]  Where are you going?
[6642.41s -> 6643.13s]  Where are you going?
[6643.13s -> 6644.25s]  Just running around?
[6644.25s -> 6651.27s]  What else do you need to do?
[6651.35s -> 6652.63s]  Listen to kids music.
[6652.63s -> 6653.27s]  Is there like a...
[6653.91s -> 6655.22s]  All right.
[6655.22s -> 6656.26s]  My energy is kind of low.
[6656.90s -> 6657.54s]  What should I do for...
[6657.54s -> 6661.58s]  Let me look for a job.
[6661.58s -> 6662.46s]  Where is it?
[6662.46s -> 6663.10s]  Business, right?
[6664.06s -> 6664.54s]  Okay.
[6664.54s -> 6665.98s]  Buy a restaurant.
[6665.98s -> 6667.10s]  Buy a vet clinic.
[6667.10s -> 6668.78s]  Register with the Ministry of Labor.
[6668.78s -> 6668.94s]  All right.
[6668.94s -> 6669.58s]  What about...
[6669.58s -> 6670.14s]  What about a job?
[6671.62s -> 6672.50s]  What can I do?
[6672.50s -> 6675.37s]  What should I do?
[6675.37s -> 6688.20s]  Detective, doctor, scientist, or actor is to get the...
[6688.20s -> 6689.24s]  I don't want to be an actor, though.
[6690.55s -> 6690.87s]  Critic?
[6692.46s -> 6694.62s]  Everyone has an opinion, but not everyone is paid to have it.
[6694.62s -> 6698.06s]  Sims who feel they have superior judgment can either enter the critic career,
[6699.14s -> 6700.66s]  food, or the arts.
[6700.66s -> 6703.21s]  Should I be a food critic?
[6703.21s -> 6714.98s]  Culinary, freelancer, gardener, painter, politician, salary person, secret agent,
[6714.98s -> 6728.02s]  a style influencer, a babysitter, fast food employee, retail employee, secret agent.
[6730.95s -> 6733.11s]  I don't think this guy is going to be a secret agent.
[6733.11s -> 6733.99s]  No, I need to be a Jedi.
[6735.70s -> 6736.58s]  Can I still do...
[6736.58s -> 6738.18s]  Can I be a secret agent and a Jedi?
[6738.18s -> 6741.90s]  Can I be a doctor and a Jedi?
[6741.90s -> 6751.22s]  Does that work?
[6751.22s -> 6751.70s]  Right?
[6751.70s -> 6758.90s]  I could be a doctor and a Jedi.
[6758.90s -> 6759.78s]  Should I be a doctor?
[6760.34s -> 6762.52s]  I feel like doctors are boring to do in The Sims, though.
[6762.52s -> 6765.00s]  That's like, since The Sims 1, that's been a thing you can do.
[6765.00s -> 6767.86s]  Maybe I will do secret agent.
[6767.86s -> 6776.04s]  From infiltrating enemy headquarters to the art of interrogation,
[6776.04s -> 6777.64s]  the more you learn, the less you'll be known.
[6778.38s -> 6779.74s]  Diamond agent and villain.
[6781.64s -> 6782.12s]  Should I do this?
[6782.76s -> 6788.94s]  Just be a villain?
[6790.50s -> 6791.46s]  Yeah, whatever, let's do it.
[6792.10s -> 6795.62s]  Browse intelligence.
[6795.62s -> 6797.32s]  Starts in three days.
[6799.54s -> 6801.70s]  Oh, no, no, it starts tomorrow.
[6801.70s -> 6803.37s]  All right, I got to be ready for work.
[6803.37s -> 6809.72s]  Browse intelligence.
[6809.72s -> 6810.28s]  What is it?
[6810.28s -> 6811.32s]  Can I do that on my phone?
[6811.88s -> 6813.00s]  Do I need a computer?
[6813.00s -> 6814.04s]  I need a computer.
[6814.04s -> 6814.68s]  Oh, shit.
[6818.10s -> 6821.22s]  Why would you be able to browse intelligence on your phone?
[6822.15s -> 6823.11s]  Please get a dog bed.
[6823.11s -> 6824.47s]  Do I have enough money for a dog bed?
[6831.42s -> 6832.06s]  Oh, yeah, I do.
[6832.06s -> 6833.50s]  Let's get like a big one.
[6833.50s -> 6834.22s]  Yeah, this one's good.
[6837.21s -> 6838.57s]  You sleep right here.
[6838.57s -> 6839.93s]  Right next to the frog thing.
[6840.49s -> 6842.04s]  There we go.
[6845.56s -> 6849.08s]  Browse high-level government secrets with a...
[6849.96s -> 6851.56s]  Would you say a library computer?
[6852.20s -> 6855.42s]  Hold on a second.
[6856.50s -> 6857.78s]  Why am I red?
[6858.10s -> 6866.65s]  I don't get it.
[6866.65s -> 6872.34s]  I think it's the light coming off the monitor.
[6874.01s -> 6874.81s]  Save, yeah.
[6877.03s -> 6878.71s]  All right, let's do our secret agent career.
[6881.50s -> 6883.26s]  So I got to get up for work tomorrow.
[6883.26s -> 6884.22s]  So look at me.
[6884.22s -> 6884.38s]  Ready?
[6884.38s -> 6885.02s]  Let's get some sleep.
[6886.06s -> 6886.70s]  Okay, go on.
[6894.95s -> 6896.07s]  The bed's too big.
[6896.07s -> 6897.74s]  Can you even sit on the bed?
[6899.58s -> 6900.62s]  The bed is way too big.
[6900.62s -> 6901.98s]  Okay, we're going to fix that.
[6901.98s -> 6911.21s]  Did I make it too small?
[6912.57s -> 6914.97s]  Why does it look tiny?
[6921.70s -> 6922.42s]  What's wrong?
[6922.42s -> 6924.26s]  This looks so small.
[6924.26s -> 6927.14s]  You should go to bed.
[6927.94s -> 6928.73s]  There we go.
[6928.73s -> 6930.70s]  Okay.
[6930.70s -> 6934.17s]  All right, I got to get up in seven hours.
[6937.02s -> 6943.96s]  There we go.
[6943.96s -> 6944.36s]  Raining?
[6946.38s -> 6946.78s]  Tense.
[6949.53s -> 6953.40s]  Oh, he's still thinking about the fire.
[6953.40s -> 6954.44s]  Watch romance.
[6955.54s -> 6956.90s]  This is such a small TV.
[6967.21s -> 6968.01s]  Browse the web.
[6972.28s -> 6973.48s]  It's 5 a.m., man.
[6973.48s -> 6974.04s]  What are you doing?
[6974.68s -> 6978.76s]  All right, I need to eat breakfast in two hours.
[6978.76s -> 6980.84s]  We're going to eat something and I've got to go to the bathroom.
[6981.40s -> 6984.01s]  All right, I'm going to have a quick meal
[6984.95s -> 6986.63s]  and I'm going to just drink blue milk.
[6990.82s -> 6991.06s]  What?
[6992.90s -> 6993.70s]  Blue milk?
[7000.60s -> 7001.40s]  Is this supposed to be?
[7003.00s -> 7004.60s]  Is this a Star Wars?
[7004.60s -> 7006.04s]  This is the Star Wars thing?
[7009.78s -> 7010.90s]  Oh, I liked it.
[7011.94s -> 7013.30s]  Really flirty.
[7016.92s -> 7018.76s]  Okay, work from work starts in about one hour.
[7020.97s -> 7021.61s]  Okay.
[7021.61s -> 7024.97s]  How are you doing?
[7024.97s -> 7037.50s]  Bladder, use the bathroom and then wash your hands.
[7037.50s -> 7038.70s]  Brush your teeth too.
[7038.70s -> 7045.18s]  Brush your teeth.
[7045.18s -> 7048.95s]  Oh, yep, car's going to be here any second.
[7049.91s -> 7050.55s]  And eat.
[7053.11s -> 7055.59s]  Eat the fruitcake that's in your pocket.
[7055.59s -> 7059.82s]  Quick, eat it before you go to work.
[7059.82s -> 7064.04s]  Oh, whatever, fine.
[7064.04s -> 7064.98s]  Where are you?
[7064.98s -> 7066.10s]  Where's he going?
[7066.10s -> 7068.74s]  Oh, you're off to work.
[7068.74s -> 7070.01s]  Okay.
[7070.01s -> 7070.97s]  Hack it.
[7070.97s -> 7072.65s]  While performing a routine background check,
[7072.65s -> 7074.81s]  Lord runs into an unexpected firewall.
[7074.81s -> 7075.45s]  Hmm.
[7075.45s -> 7078.65s]  He didn't think the information he needed was going to be protected.
[7078.65s -> 7080.49s]  You need to hack through the firewall to dig deeper.
[7080.49s -> 7081.69s]  I'm calling a senior.
[7081.69s -> 7084.70s]  I don't hack it.
[7084.70s -> 7090.52s]  I don't have any experience with a computer.
[7090.52s -> 7091.88s]  I don't even own a computer.
[7091.88s -> 7094.41s]  I'm going to hack it.
[7094.49s -> 7101.58s]  After some ingenious crypto work,
[7101.58s -> 7104.22s]  Lord beats the firewall and discovers that nothing is what it seems.
[7104.22s -> 7108.65s]  He rushes findings to his boss and turns out he's uncovered a nefarious plot.
[7108.65s -> 7119.24s]  $50.
[7119.24s -> 7120.36s]  $50.
[7120.36s -> 7127.74s]  Are you coming back?
[7127.74s -> 7129.86s]  What's wrong?
[7131.14s -> 7133.94s]  So gross from using the public bathroom.
[7133.94s -> 7139.66s]  Setting foot in that public bathroom may have been a mistake.
[7139.66s -> 7140.78s]  My public bathroom?
[7141.58s -> 7146.55s]  Or which public bathroom does he not like?
[7146.55s -> 7147.83s]  The one at work?
[7147.83s -> 7151.64s]  He's got minty fresh teeth.
[7151.64s -> 7154.22s]  What's this?
[7154.78s -> 7155.74s]  Meet a celebrity.
[7157.74s -> 7158.54s]  Oh, okay.
[7160.33s -> 7165.02s]  The humor and hijinks festival is today until four.
[7165.02s -> 7165.82s]  Oh, leave work.
[7165.82s -> 7166.54s]  Just leave.
[7167.10s -> 7168.66s]  When do I get back from work?
[7168.66s -> 7169.94s]  Can I just leave work?
[7169.94s -> 7174.70s]  I'm not missing this.
[7174.70s -> 7177.45s]  Wait, $75.
[7177.45s -> 7180.63s]  All right.
[7180.63s -> 7182.55s]  I'm not going to miss the hijinks festival.
[7183.48s -> 7183.96s]  Where is it?
[7185.32s -> 7185.56s]  All right.
[7185.56s -> 7186.36s]  I'm going to go to the event.
[7186.36s -> 7191.82s]  Let's make sure the dog is okay.
[7191.82s -> 7195.45s]  Stop watching TV.
[7195.45s -> 7195.85s]  All right.
[7195.85s -> 7201.96s]  Now let's say, you know, I've got a skill in comedy.
[7201.96s -> 7203.00s]  Oh, all right.
[7203.00s -> 7208.14s]  I take a photo of the dog.
[7208.14s -> 7226.39s]  Okay.
[7226.39s -> 7231.77s]  Yodel has gained 17 Simstagram followers.
[7232.66s -> 7233.14s]  All right.
[7233.14s -> 7233.54s]  Let's go.
[7236.94s -> 7238.52s]  You got food, right?
[7238.52s -> 7239.32s]  There's food in the bowl.
[7240.97s -> 7241.69s]  You're good.
[7241.69s -> 7242.81s]  You're just chilling.
[7242.81s -> 7243.94s]  Have the TV on.
[7243.94s -> 7244.26s]  All right.
[7244.26s -> 7244.74s]  I'm going to...
[7244.74s -> 7246.10s]  I'll eat at the festival.
[7246.10s -> 7246.74s]  I want to go to the...
[7246.74s -> 7248.02s]  I want to do the festival.
[7248.02s -> 7249.38s]  Let's go.
[7249.38s -> 7254.10s]  Should I bring Yodel?
[7263.91s -> 7264.63s]  I guess we're going.
[7269.61s -> 7271.05s]  I can't tell if your cam is delayed or not.
[7271.05s -> 7272.33s]  People have been saying that the whole stream.
[7272.33s -> 7273.77s]  I don't know why it would be happening.
[7274.41s -> 7279.64s]  I don't know.
[7286.41s -> 7286.73s]  All right.
[7287.37s -> 7288.09s]  I'm here.
[7288.09s -> 7291.02s]  Who's this?
[7291.02s -> 7292.60s]  This is a bee-lister.
[7295.05s -> 7295.61s]  Okay.
[7295.61s -> 7296.57s]  Chat with Minerva.
[7297.13s -> 7300.42s]  So I have to meet a celebrity and...
[7302.10s -> 7303.06s]  Why is the...
[7303.06s -> 7303.30s]  Okay.
[7303.30s -> 7304.34s]  Where's the dog even going?
[7305.46s -> 7306.50s]  That's a huge TV.
[7308.06s -> 7309.18s]  Should I start telling jokes?
[7316.23s -> 7317.19s]  I'm not going to be like that guy.
[7321.59s -> 7322.63s]  I'm not going to be like that guy.
[7322.63s -> 7323.43s]  I'm telling you right now.
[7323.99s -> 7325.67s]  I don't know what happened.
[7327.19s -> 7327.67s]  Fainted.
[7327.67s -> 7327.99s]  Because you...
[7332.55s -> 7333.43s]  Is that going to be all right?
[7336.79s -> 7338.15s]  What are you doing?
[7339.59s -> 7342.63s]  This is a weird place to do a photo shoot
[7342.63s -> 7344.47s]  in the public bar bathroom.
[7345.96s -> 7346.52s]  Get on the mic.
[7347.16s -> 7347.64s]  I got to start.
[7347.64s -> 7348.44s]  I got to impress somebody.
[7349.16s -> 7351.26s]  I'm going to practice singing.
[7351.98s -> 7353.30s]  Let's ruin the whole party.
[7355.67s -> 7371.21s]  He gave up immediately.
[7371.21s -> 7372.25s]  This person's shit-faced,
[7372.25s -> 7373.93s]  and they've had one drink, by the way.
[7373.93s -> 7382.52s]  You just gave me two dollars?
[7385.18s -> 7386.70s]  People are giving me money.
[7386.70s -> 7387.42s]  Two bucks?
[7393.62s -> 7413.35s]  Congrats on landing that sweet job.
[7413.35s -> 7414.63s]  I think this is going to be great for you.
[7414.63s -> 7415.19s]  Oh, thanks.
[7417.02s -> 7418.06s]  I thought the bar lit on fire.
[7418.06s -> 7418.94s]  I was like, oh my God.
[7427.75s -> 7429.11s]  What is happening to people?
[7429.11s -> 7431.11s]  You're face down in trash.
[7431.11s -> 7433.00s]  Somebody needs to help this person.
[7439.26s -> 7446.23s]  Is this weird to do in front of the celebrity?
[7455.27s -> 7459.54s]  No one's paying.
[7460.10s -> 7460.98s]  Wait, squeamish.
[7463.42s -> 7466.22s]  Oh, he doesn't like this trash.
[7467.02s -> 7467.66s]  I forgot.
[7468.46s -> 7471.27s]  But he wanted to play in it.
[7471.27s -> 7476.49s]  I have to meet the celebrity.
[7479.74s -> 7480.22s]  Call over.
[7481.74s -> 7488.47s]  You made him do it.
[7488.47s -> 7488.79s]  All right.
[7489.59s -> 7490.63s]  Didn't I meet this person already
[7490.63s -> 7491.19s]  in front of the house?
[7497.18s -> 7498.46s]  What am I holding?
[7501.85s -> 7502.73s]  People need to relax.
[7505.16s -> 7506.60s]  What am I eating?
[7506.60s -> 7509.38s]  Is this the old fruitcake?
[7513.13s -> 7514.73s]  This guy's fucked.
[7514.73s -> 7516.33s]  This guy's a fucking weirdo.
[7527.98s -> 7528.70s]  Photographer.
[7530.23s -> 7531.83s]  Wait, I can sell this?
[7531.83s -> 7533.51s]  I can sell the picture of the dog.
[7536.70s -> 7537.74s]  I need to meet a celebrity.
[7542.47s -> 7542.95s]  Come over here.
[7542.95s -> 7543.43s]  We need to talk.
[7549.26s -> 7549.58s]  All right.
[7549.58s -> 7550.62s]  So let's talk.
[7555.00s -> 7555.88s]  How you doing?
[7555.88s -> 7556.52s]  Nice to meet you.
[7560.89s -> 7561.61s]  Did you see my dog?
[7566.57s -> 7567.93s]  Can I not say anything?
[7567.93s -> 7568.97s]  I have to meet a celebrity.
[7568.97s -> 7569.85s]  Is this a celebrity?
[7571.69s -> 7572.57s]  What the hell?
[7572.57s -> 7573.29s]  Who smells?
[7575.37s -> 7576.17s]  Who smells?
[7581.83s -> 7583.27s]  Somebody stinks over here.
[7583.27s -> 7583.75s]  Who is it?
[7585.27s -> 7585.91s]  Is it the dog?
[7595.93s -> 7596.97s]  Hey, I'm going to come to this
[7596.97s -> 7598.41s]  really cool insider party
[7598.41s -> 7600.17s]  and I'm going to bring my wicked smelly dog.
[7613.75s -> 7614.55s]  I need to meet us.
[7614.55s -> 7616.63s]  Anybody want one of these old fruitcakes?
[7620.79s -> 7622.07s]  I'm going to put it in front of one of their faces.
[7628.98s -> 7636.30s]  Who's wicked smelly dog is this?
[7636.30s -> 7636.54s]  All right.
[7636.54s -> 7637.66s]  I got to get it together.
[7638.86s -> 7639.90s]  Call everybody over.
[7641.50s -> 7642.62s]  Hey, everybody.
[7642.62s -> 7643.50s]  Old fruitcake.
[7644.38s -> 7646.31s]  Are people going to eat it?
[7654.54s -> 7655.90s]  Wait, does this smell?
[7660.58s -> 7661.46s]  Yo, we're good.
[7662.02s -> 7662.26s]  Okay.
[7662.90s -> 7664.04s]  All right, all right, all right, all right.
[7666.73s -> 7667.21s]  Let's talk.
[7668.17s -> 7669.13s]  You like the fruitcake?
[7669.77s -> 7671.37s]  I'm going to lie and tell you that I made it.
[7673.29s -> 7673.93s]  Don't do it.
[7674.57s -> 7675.05s]  Don't do it.
[7675.61s -> 7676.57s]  You're going to hit your head.
[7676.57s -> 7677.13s]  Watch your head.
[7677.13s -> 7677.61s]  Watch your head.
[7679.99s -> 7681.82s]  Oh, my God.
[7681.82s -> 7684.46s]  I can't believe Judith Ward was eating dinner.
[7686.78s -> 7687.98s]  I forget the guy's name.
[7689.58s -> 7690.14s]  Did I get it?
[7693.26s -> 7693.58s]  Debate.
[7694.70s -> 7697.27s]  It was a fun filled day with a celebrity.
[7699.19s -> 7699.99s]  Are we getting kicked out?
[7718.71s -> 7719.51s]  Is this a celebrity?
[7720.07s -> 7731.98s]  Why is this person glowing?
[7735.83s -> 7736.31s]  Wait, what does it say?
[7737.66s -> 7738.14s]  What did that say?
[7739.86s -> 7741.70s]  All lifestyles have a limited amount of progress
[7741.70s -> 7742.82s]  that can be gained daily.
[7744.02s -> 7746.58s]  You reach the daily limit or a lifestyle.
[7749.88s -> 7756.68s]  Humor and high drinks festival is in town.
[7756.68s -> 7756.92s]  What?
[7757.96s -> 7764.12s]  That's not where I've been.
[7777.29s -> 7782.06s]  All right, put it down and go to the fun festival.
[7782.06s -> 7782.82s]  Let's go.
[7783.78s -> 7791.30s]  So this is the high drinks festival.
[7791.30s -> 7792.26s]  It was across the street.
[7796.74s -> 7797.46s]  All right.
[7797.46s -> 7799.94s]  I'm in a good mood, though.
[7807.80s -> 7809.48s]  So now what do I have to do?
[7809.48s -> 7810.52s]  I have to meet a celebrity.
[7813.99s -> 7817.03s]  Oh, Chorg Chorg is the dog that smells.
[7820.60s -> 7821.08s]  Come here.
[7821.08s -> 7821.40s]  Come here.
[7821.96s -> 7825.70s]  Don't do that.
[7826.34s -> 7827.75s]  What the fuck?
[7828.47s -> 7828.95s]  Yodo.
[7839.78s -> 7848.55s]  OK, you know, you just want me to go home.
[7854.06s -> 7859.88s]  With soup, I mean, how do I get to see the the usually
[7859.88s -> 7860.92s]  there's something in the top left.
[7860.92s -> 7862.52s]  It gives progress, right?
[7862.52s -> 7872.15s]  What's this?
[7872.15s -> 7874.44s]  We look up squids.
[7879.37s -> 7887.29s]  Join the pranksters.
[7889.42s -> 7890.38s]  Join the pranksters.
[7892.46s -> 7894.14s]  What's this?
[7895.91s -> 7897.03s]  Oh, by swag.
[7897.03s -> 7897.59s]  Let's haggle.
[7904.25s -> 7904.89s]  Where are you going?
[7905.69s -> 7907.69s]  Wait, did I smoke?
[7909.30s -> 7910.10s]  Sit and try.
[7910.74s -> 7911.67s]  Let's try that.
[7917.50s -> 7917.98s]  What are you doing?
[7917.98s -> 7918.70s]  It doesn't like what?
[7926.95s -> 7927.91s]  I guess I don't like it.
[7929.48s -> 7930.36s]  Change the flavor.
[7932.71s -> 7934.23s]  How about golden rush?
[7938.02s -> 7939.14s]  Let's go light fireworks.
[7939.54s -> 7940.26s]  All right, let's go.
[7940.26s -> 7940.58s]  I'm here.
[7940.58s -> 7942.14s]  I'm already here.
[7942.14s -> 7942.78s]  Bring some friends.
[7942.78s -> 7943.26s]  I'm already here.
[7947.00s -> 7947.88s]  Light fireworks.
[7947.88s -> 7952.62s]  OK, I have to go to work.
[7962.98s -> 7963.46s]  What's this?
[7965.13s -> 7965.61s]  Energize.
[7965.61s -> 7966.57s]  He's keyed up.
[7967.29s -> 7970.23s]  All right, where do I get fireworks?
[7970.87s -> 7974.02s]  Right here, right?
[7974.02s -> 7976.07s]  Does not own this item.
[7976.63s -> 7977.51s]  Aren't these fireworks?
[7978.98s -> 7980.10s]  I have to buy them for the stall.
[7983.66s -> 7984.22s]  Where's the dog?
[7994.12s -> 7995.16s]  I invited somebody.
[7995.16s -> 7995.96s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7995.96s -> 7996.44s]  Here they are.
[8000.54s -> 8002.46s]  We're going to chat and I got some golden.
[8002.46s -> 8002.94s]  What was it called?

[8338.60s -> 8339.48s]  You're a little late.
[8344.81s -> 8346.97s]  Eating food from the city unlocks the ability to cook it.

[8430.26s -> 8430.58s]  Bye.
[8437.13s -> 8438.09s]  We got to go.
[8438.09s -> 8439.13s]  We got to go.
[8439.13s -> 8440.33s]  I just cleared everybody up.
[8441.05s -> 8442.81s]  Everybody's got cleared out.
[8442.81s -> 8443.61s]  I need to pick this up.
[8443.61s -> 8465.08s]  So we let's go take a bath.

[8478.09s -> 8479.85s]  And then we're going to get you fed.
[8479.85s -> 8480.97s]  And why are you so red?
[8480.97s -> 8481.77s]  I don't know.
[8481.77s -> 8482.33s]  I had no.
[8482.57s -> 8484.49s]  It's like a thermal camera pointed at my face today.
[8484.49s -> 8484.97s]  I don't know why.
[8485.61s -> 8488.49s]  Do I have to go?
[8488.49s -> 8489.77s]  What time is work tomorrow?
[8489.77s -> 8490.33s]  All right.
[8490.33s -> 8491.21s]  I got to be ready for work.

[8495.53s -> 8503.64s]  Okay.

[8553.54s -> 8554.50s]  They sell it in bundles.
[8555.14s -> 8563.00s]  Oh my God.

[8577.88s -> 8583.26s]  Okay.
[8583.26s -> 8583.90s]  That's whatever.
[8586.30s -> 8587.10s]  Yes.
[8587.10s -> 8590.07s]  What time do I have to get up?
[8590.07s -> 8592.65s]  I think my energy is fine.
[8592.65s -> 8593.26s]  All right.
[8593.26s -> 8593.90s]  I'm going to take a nap.
[8593.90s -> 8595.18s]  I'm going to go to the library.
[8595.18s -> 8599.56s]  Okay.

[8610.92s -> 8611.88s]  Work starts in an hour.
[8611.88s -> 8612.52s]  All right.
[8612.52s -> 8613.56s]  I don't have time to go to the library.
[8613.56s -> 8614.52s]  It doesn't matter.
[8614.52s -> 8619.82s]  Have a coffee.
[8621.00s -> 8624.82s]  And then microwave a chicken nuggets.
[8624.82s -> 8626.49s]  That sounds like a plan to me.
[8629.37s -> 8629.93s]  You're good.
[8630.49s -> 8642.12s]  I'll fill your bowl.

[8659.72s -> 8663.34s]  Where are they?
[8663.34s -> 8672.98s]  These are cat toys.
[8674.22s -> 8675.34s]  Do these count as dog toys?
[8675.98s -> 8680.42s]  Just give them one of these out here.
[8685.40s -> 8685.72s]  All right.
[8685.72s -> 8686.76s]  Go check it out.

[8729.96s -> 8730.76s]  Oh, fuck.
[8730.76s -> 8741.72s]  How do I make sure Santa comes?
[8741.72s -> 8742.60s]  File presents?
[8749.11s -> 8750.39s]  What's with the scary music?
[8754.62s -> 8756.46s]  Will Santa come if I have presents like this?
[8756.46s -> 8757.10s]  Just on the...
[8757.10s -> 8770.49s]  Just hanging out?
[8770.49s -> 8771.83s]  Add a present.
[8771.83s -> 8774.10s]  Oh, do I have any object?
[8774.10s -> 8775.14s]  I'm going to make macaroni and cheese
[8775.14s -> 8777.82s]  or grilled cheese and put it in there.
[8777.82s -> 8778.78s]  I need a fireplace.

[8779.42s -> 8782.94s]  That's not going to happen.
[8782.94s -> 8784.14s]  I need a fireplace.
[8784.14s -> 8785.58s]  I'm going to have to sell the bed.
[8785.58s -> 8793.78s]  I could sell the public bathroom.
[8793.78s -> 8794.66s]  You don't need a fireplace.
[8794.66s -> 8801.98s]  Oh, okay.
[8801.98s -> 8802.70s]  Starts tomorrow.
[8804.86s -> 8805.50s]  Work until three.
[8805.50s -> 8805.82s]  All right.
[8808.71s -> 8809.91s]  Why do I have a public bathroom?
[8809.91s -> 8810.15s]  I don't know.
[8810.15s -> 8811.27s]  I just saw it and I thought it was funny.
[8811.83s -> 8813.35s]  Put it in here.
[8813.35s -> 8814.55s]  All right.

[8847.40s -> 8847.64s]  Okay.
[8854.02s -> 8854.26s]  All right.

[8880.76s -> 8881.40s]  I don't need to cater.
[8881.40s -> 8882.20s]  I'm just going to order a pizza.
[8887.45s -> 8888.73s]  No, this is right now.
[8888.73s -> 8890.01s]  I want to do it for tomorrow.

[8970.34s -> 8970.74s]  I need to...
[8970.74s -> 8971.46s]  How do I order food?
[8976.60s -> 8977.40s]  How do you order food?
[8982.78s -> 8984.22s]  I hate video games.
[8984.22s -> 8984.86s]  Put it down.
[8984.86s -> 8985.50s]  What are you doing?
[8988.28s -> 8988.68s]  All right.
[8988.68s -> 8990.04s]  How do I order food?
[8990.04s -> 8997.08s]  Hire a service.
[8997.64s -> 9006.54s]  Where do I do it?

[9049.14s -> 9049.62s]  We want...
[9049.62s -> 9053.02s]  Who wants cheese?
[9053.02s -> 9054.38s]  Cheese pizza on the way, everybody.

[9080.70s -> 9081.26s]  Pizza coming.
[9083.50s -> 9084.30s]  Uncomfortable.
[9086.46s -> 9087.58s]  Too many Sims.
[9088.38s -> 9092.81s]  Well, I invited everybody here for a Christmas party.
[9092.81s -> 9093.77s]  Pizza.
[9093.77s -> 9095.53s]  Let me get it.
[9098.31s -> 9098.87s]  Please.
[9098.87s -> 9099.75s]  I need to get the pizza.
[9101.61s -> 9102.01s]  Do not...
[9103.26s -> 9104.46s]  Go get the pizza.
[9106.66s -> 9107.54s]  Oh, my God.
[9108.58s -> 9109.62s]  Get the pizza.
[9121.06s -> 9122.42s]  What are you talking about?
[9122.42s -> 9124.02s]  He's locked in?
[9124.02s -> 9125.67s]  How is he stuck?
[9127.91s -> 9130.58s]  What are you talking about?
[9130.58s -> 9131.46s]  Get the pizza.
[9134.41s -> 9137.29s]  Are you locked out of the outside of the house?
[9152.57s -> 9153.85s]  What is happening?
[9156.36s -> 9157.56s]  No, get the pizza.
[9157.56s -> 9158.44s]  Why is he going to bed?
[9159.80s -> 9161.24s]  You fucking weirdo.
[9162.33s -> 9163.69s]  Why is he locked out of his...
[9163.69s -> 9165.13s]  Why is he locked inside of his...
[9165.69s -> 9167.35s]  Can somebody get the door?
[9170.55s -> 9173.11s]  It's the worst fucking holiday party ever.
[9174.10s -> 9174.74s]  What is going...
[9174.74s -> 9175.70s]  Make another door quick.
[9179.59s -> 9180.63s]  This guy would have left.
[9181.27s -> 9181.67s]  You know what?
[9181.67s -> 9182.47s]  Just get rid of the door.
[9183.19s -> 9185.94s]  Just open it.
[9185.94s -> 9187.06s]  No, he put the pizza down.
[9188.76s -> 9190.52s]  I ordered that pizza and I'm going to get it.
[9191.59s -> 9193.19s]  I ordered that pizza.
[9193.19s -> 9195.69s]  Just get in.
[9195.69s -> 9196.09s]  Come in.
[9197.85s -> 9198.25s]  Come in.
[9206.34s -> 9206.98s]  Just come...
[9206.98s -> 9208.34s]  Just walk into the house.
[9208.34s -> 9209.06s]  Walk into the house.
[9209.06s -> 9209.54s]  I'm right here.
[9221.11s -> 9224.52s]  Why can you all leave and I can't?
[9224.52s -> 9227.00s]  No, he's eating the old fruitcake in his pocket.
[9227.00s -> 9228.44s]  There's a pizza out here.
[9228.44s -> 9229.24s]  I paid for it.
[9236.52s -> 9237.02s]  What the...
[9249.35s -> 9253.91s]  Everybody, there's going to be sand in this pizza.
[9255.67s -> 9258.63s]  Imagine putting a pizza on the ground at the beach.
[9260.07s -> 9261.03s]  You wouldn't pay me to eat this.
[9263.43s -> 9264.87s]  You didn't show up to claim your pizza,
[9264.87s -> 9269.51s]  so I charged you $25 and left it outside the ants to enjoy.
[9276.57s -> 9277.61s]  Everybody was going to leave.
[9278.57s -> 9279.93s]  Have Sims kiss?
[9279.93s -> 9281.78s]  What?
[9281.78s -> 9282.90s]  All right, we got our pizza.
[9284.18s -> 9285.06s]  Everything's good to go.
[9285.70s -> 9286.50s]  All right, let's bring...
[9287.14s -> 9288.92s]  Bring the party back inside.
[9288.92s -> 9289.32s]  What do you say?
[9289.32s -> 9289.96s]  Come on, everybody.
[9300.54s -> 9301.90s]  You talking shit to my dog?
[9310.44s -> 9311.00s]  What are you saying?
[9312.84s -> 9313.56s]  Excuse...
[9315.86s -> 9318.10s]  And people just coming in and yelling at my dog.
[9329.50s -> 9331.18s]  I think I'm stuck between three people.
[9333.82s -> 9336.01s]  All right, that was fun.
[9336.01s -> 9336.49s]  Enough of that.
[9339.05s -> 9339.77s]  Clean up the pizza.
[9339.77s -> 9340.73s]  I need to fill the dog bowl.
[9344.12s -> 9344.84s]  You okay?
[9344.84s -> 9345.56s]  What's going on?
[9357.50s -> 9358.46s]  Who talks shit to my dog?
[9364.23s -> 9365.75s]  Why am I dressed like this?
[9374.07s -> 9374.47s]  Come here.
[9376.79s -> 9377.83s]  Bro, make him leave.
[9378.71s -> 9379.19s]  Cake.
[9379.91s -> 9381.75s]  Oh, wait, it's time for somebody to have a present.
[9383.69s -> 9385.77s]  All right, everybody, it's time.
[9385.77s -> 9387.37s]  Merry Christmas.
[9387.37s -> 9389.88s]  It's time for all of us to open the presents.
[9401.48s -> 9402.52s]  No, open the presents.
[9410.14s -> 9410.70s]  Presents.
[9410.70s -> 9411.42s]  Open the presents.
[9415.94s -> 9416.42s]  Here we go.
[9417.88s -> 9418.60s]  All right, everybody.
[9419.24s -> 9421.14s]  There's stuff under there for pretty much everyone.
[9422.26s -> 9423.06s]  Merry Christmas.
[9423.06s -> 9424.58s]  Thanks for coming to the party.
[9424.58s -> 9425.54s]  I hope everyone had a good time.
[9426.82s -> 9428.18s]  Let's go ahead and get those presents open.
[9431.00s -> 9431.72s]  Let's see what I got.
[9433.40s -> 9433.96s]  I got...
[9435.24s -> 9436.04s]  I can't believe it.
[9436.04s -> 9436.28s]  It's...
[9439.13s -> 9440.01s]  Who would give one...
[9440.01s -> 9440.25s]  What?
[9441.85s -> 9442.33s]  What'd you get?
[9447.05s -> 9447.53s]  What'd you get?
[9447.85s -> 9448.33s]  What did you get?
[9456.33s -> 9458.33s]  There's nothing in each one of these boxes.
[9471.37s -> 9472.33s]  Open the presents.
[9474.33s -> 9477.02s]  Hey, this one's for you, son.
[9479.24s -> 9480.04s]  New frog.
[9485.18s -> 9486.46s]  How come no one's opening presents?
[9492.22s -> 9493.42s]  Complaining about video games.
[9497.74s -> 9498.62s]  Oh, my God, I smell.
[9506.14s -> 9507.02s]  What is going on here?
[9509.82s -> 9510.30s]  What was that?
[9512.14s -> 9512.30s]  Oh, shit.
[9515.26s -> 9518.06s]  Lord McGulty has identified the goldfish,
[9518.06s -> 9521.10s]  a new type of fish recorded in certain fishing spots.
[9527.78s -> 9528.74s]  How did I learn that?
[9533.06s -> 9534.10s]  All right, everybody get out.
[9536.18s -> 9536.58s]  All right.
[9538.82s -> 9539.94s]  Oh, shit, the coffee maker.
[9539.94s -> 9546.90s]  Everybody out now.
[9547.70s -> 9548.58s]  Everybody get out of here.
[9560.58s -> 9561.86s]  All right, actually, I want to be your friend
[9561.86s -> 9563.22s]  because you're actually really nice.
[9564.26s -> 9566.02s]  This person's really nice and actually helping.
[9567.22s -> 9568.66s]  What's the person's name?
[9570.42s -> 9572.04s]  Is her name Hillary?
[9572.76s -> 9573.24s]  Lawrence.
[9573.24s -> 9574.84s]  All right, I want to talk to Hillary.
[9577.40s -> 9579.08s]  Look at the people that are actually helping.
[9579.08s -> 9580.20s]  You know how much we're panning the asses
[9580.20s -> 9581.24s]  to put a huge house party on?
[9583.00s -> 9583.50s]  Yeah.
[9584.52s -> 9586.28s]  You don't understand, it takes like three days
[9586.28s -> 9588.12s]  to come back from a house party like this.
[9588.12s -> 9589.48s]  Like you brought like a bunch of people over.
[9590.44s -> 9591.80s]  It takes days to clean this up.
[9592.44s -> 9593.08s]  I appreciate it.
[9598.09s -> 9599.21s]  That's not me in the bed.
[9602.60s -> 9603.24s]  Wait, what?
[9604.20s -> 9605.16s]  Who is this lady?
[9606.12s -> 9615.66s]  What?
[9615.66s -> 9616.14s]  Why is it?
[9616.14s -> 9616.70s]  What does that mean?
[9616.70s -> 9618.54s]  Assigned to left side.
[9619.66s -> 9622.22s]  Did you just claim the bed?
[9624.30s -> 9625.42s]  I'm very confused.
[9626.22s -> 9642.02s]  Everybody fucking leave.
[9642.02s -> 9643.30s]  How do I kick everybody out of here?
[9644.18s -> 9645.30s]  Wait, he's putting a person in.
[9645.94s -> 9648.10s]  I'm going to look and see what it is.
[9656.65s -> 9656.97s]  And?
[9661.53s -> 9661.93s]  What is it?
[9663.85s -> 9664.49s]  Is it nothing?
[9665.13s -> 9669.77s]  Don't sleep in my bed.
[9672.89s -> 9674.17s]  All right, that was a fun party.
[9674.17s -> 9675.05s]  Now, everybody get out.
[9678.25s -> 9678.89s]  I am pissed.
[9678.89s -> 9680.17s]  I want everybody to leave so bad.
[9680.17s -> 9681.21s]  How do I kick everybody out of here?
[9689.45s -> 9691.53s]  It is midnight and they're still here.
[9693.05s -> 9694.49s]  This kid's going to my fridge.
[9694.49s -> 9694.97s]  Excuse me.
[9694.97s -> 9695.29s]  What's this?
[9699.86s -> 9700.42s]  Pay for that?
[9708.04s -> 9710.36s]  Money got deducted from my account when he opened the door.
[9710.36s -> 9713.27s]  I mean, I appreciate it.
[9713.27s -> 9713.51s]  Thanks.
[9714.71s -> 9715.45s]  Why was there?
[9716.65s -> 9717.13s]  Did they?
[9717.93s -> 9722.60s]  It's taking out fucking booze out of the fridge.
[9723.32s -> 9724.20s]  Put that down.
[9724.20s -> 9724.60s]  What is it?
[9724.60s -> 9725.32s]  Oh, it's orange juice.
[9725.32s -> 9725.64s]  All right.
[9731.37s -> 9733.21s]  I think they took all the dirty dishes
[9735.93s -> 9737.29s]  and they put them into the fridge
[9738.49s -> 9742.58s]  because there's nowhere else to put them.
[9747.99s -> 9760.31s]  These people are very comfortable here, apparently.
[9761.35s -> 9765.03s]  Apparently, you're incredibly comfortable to take a bath in my house.
[9765.99s -> 9769.99s]  And I literally, we met 12 hours ago
[9771.99s -> 9772.87s]  and you make it a mess.
[9775.80s -> 9777.40s]  It's 1 15 in the morning.
[9778.04s -> 9781.21s]  These people, excuse me.
[9784.09s -> 9785.53s]  Why are they still here?
[9797.96s -> 9799.32s]  This guy insulted your dog.
[9801.38s -> 9802.66s]  Wait, he's got a Christmas sweater on.
[9803.72s -> 9805.00s]  He's the only festive one here.
[9805.80s -> 9808.02s]  He's the only one that cares about being festive.
[9814.46s -> 9816.22s]  We're going on two o'clock in the morning.
[9820.22s -> 9831.53s]  She wanted to get in the bed and got mad
[9831.53s -> 9833.21s]  because I was on her side of the bed
[9834.49s -> 9836.09s]  and now she's talking into the mirror.
[9844.54s -> 9845.18s]  What are you doing?
[9845.18s -> 9846.30s]  You're making like a souffle.
[9848.17s -> 9849.85s]  Why are these people just claiming my house?
[9864.71s -> 9883.61s]  I thought everybody has to go so bad.
[9891.14s -> 9893.62s]  I've never seen this happen in The Sims before.
[9894.18s -> 9896.50s]  They usually leave at like 11 o'clock at night.
[9900.20s -> 9901.96s]  They're all here at three o'clock.
[9901.96s -> 9905.08s]  Even the kid, there's a little kid here at three a.m.
[9907.13s -> 9907.69s]  Send them home.
[9907.69s -> 9908.17s]  I already did.
[9908.17s -> 9909.69s]  It said my party wasn't successful.
[9910.33s -> 9911.53s]  Everyone's going to leave now or something.
[9913.35s -> 9915.03s]  They're going to be here until I get up in the morning.
[9931.56s -> 9934.20s]  Are they actually going to stay here all day, all night?
[9935.24s -> 9937.00s]  They have to be, they have to go back to sleep.
[9939.37s -> 9940.33s]  They're making coffee.
[9946.79s -> 9950.55s]  Bro, enjoy yourself.
[9951.11s -> 9952.31s]  Have another, have a latte.
[9959.54s -> 9962.14s]  It's almost time for me to wake up in the morning.
[9966.49s -> 9968.09s]  It's just a bath house.
[9968.09s -> 9970.33s]  I'm actually, I don't understand what's happening right now.
[9972.90s -> 9973.62s]  These people are fighting.
[9987.19s -> 9988.23s]  It's Christmas now.
[9991.13s -> 9992.73s]  Okay, get up, get up, get up.
[9993.29s -> 9994.09s]  Use the bathroom.
[9998.54s -> 10000.86s]  Guys, I can't make them leave.
[10001.66s -> 10003.34s]  There's no send home option.
[10006.54s -> 10008.22s]  They all live here now.
[10014.04s -> 10014.76s]  Go home.
[10015.40s -> 10016.92s]  Stop drinking coffee in my bed.
[10021.69s -> 10024.01s]  Hey, all right, get it, you're out.
[10024.97s -> 10025.69s]  Get out of here.
[10029.00s -> 10030.44s]  Did I go to work?
[10046.06s -> 10047.82s]  Winterfest is starting now.
[10047.82s -> 10049.98s]  Okay, well glad everybody here was here for the quiche.
[10050.38s -> 10051.86s]  Winterfest?
[10057.34s -> 10063.51s]  Everybody ready to sing?
[10063.51s -> 10064.31s]  I guess.
[10064.87s -> 10077.56s]  Nobody slept in 20.
[10101.35s -> 10104.79s]  He looked like he was about to go fist in the present.
[10113.16s -> 10114.44s]  I seriously thought he was gonna pee.
[10114.44s -> 10116.44s]  I thought he was gonna go down and take his shit in the present.
[10117.72s -> 10119.08s]  All right, party's over.
[10121.53s -> 10124.92s]  Okay, happy, happy birthday.
[10127.35s -> 10129.91s]  Is Santa gonna show up or do I actually need a fireplace?
[10135.27s -> 10137.21s]  All right, I'll take some coffee.
[10138.66s -> 10139.38s]  Thank you.
[10139.46s -> 10140.66s]  Okay, goodbye.
[10142.58s -> 10144.42s]  Let's share Winterfest spirit.
[10145.30s -> 10148.68s]  Catch Father Winter and ask him for a present to satisfy.
[10148.68s -> 10151.32s]  Hey, Winter, hey, here's an 8 p.m. near fireplaces.
[10152.44s -> 10153.32s]  I'm selling something.
[10153.32s -> 10154.36s]  I'm selling the fucking outhouse.
[10158.04s -> 10159.48s]  We need a fireplace.
[10159.48s -> 10161.96s]  Everyone's gonna be trapped here for some weird reason.
[10161.96s -> 10162.76s]  I need a fireplace.
[10168.97s -> 10170.01s]  We need open presents.
[10170.25s -> 10174.89s]  Okay, presents, open presents and stuff.
[10177.21s -> 10179.05s]  Every, even cavemen.
[10181.85s -> 10183.85s]  Click on yourself is an option to make people leave.
[10188.25s -> 10188.97s]  No, there isn't.
[10191.34s -> 10192.06s]  They just won't.
[10192.06s -> 10193.26s]  They're just stuck here forever.
[10197.18s -> 10199.50s]  You, where's the option to get rid of everybody?
[10199.50s -> 10201.58s]  Get actions, form a group.
[10204.50s -> 10207.86s]  Click on the door.
[10208.42s -> 10209.14s]  There is no door.
[10209.14s -> 10210.90s]  I deleted it because the pizza guy couldn't get in.
[10212.78s -> 10216.06s]  This is drinking coffee and using the microwave and taking a bath in my house.
[10216.70s -> 10219.14s]  I need to, okay, I need a, uh.
[10221.67s -> 10222.95s]  I, we're selling.
[10222.95s -> 10223.75s]  I'm getting rid of this.
[10224.31s -> 10226.23s]  I'm buying one single fucking toilet.
[10226.23s -> 10227.75s]  This thing was like five grand.
[10228.79s -> 10231.45s]  I need, we need a fireplace for the Santa Claus.
[10232.09s -> 10238.50s]  Let's put a regular toilet in here.
[10240.02s -> 10241.62s]  And now I have 2,000 more dollars.
[10243.86s -> 10244.18s]  I don't know.
[10244.18s -> 10245.62s]  This is like the chic one, whatever.
[10248.18s -> 10251.80s]  Okay, good to go.
[10252.44s -> 10253.40s]  Now I need a fireplace.
[10257.26s -> 10258.14s]  What's the cheapest one?
[10261.21s -> 10261.93s]  600 bucks.
[10262.49s -> 10264.97s]  This thing's cheap.
[10264.97s -> 10265.61s]  It doesn't matter.
[10265.61s -> 10266.09s]  We just waited.
[10266.09s -> 10268.66s]  We just need presents from, there you go.
[10268.66s -> 10269.86s]  Okay, I need a door.
[10270.81s -> 10272.49s]  There's, I don't need a door.
[10272.49s -> 10274.71s]  Okay, here we go.
[10275.35s -> 10278.62s]  How do I light the fireplace?
[10292.39s -> 10293.43s]  Can somebody else do it?
[10298.41s -> 10300.84s]  Oh, you know what?
[10300.84s -> 10303.48s]  The worst part about this is people won't leave.
[10303.48s -> 10304.44s]  I can't make them leave.
[10304.44s -> 10305.96s]  There's no option to make them leave.
[10305.96s -> 10310.44s]  But yet every time they open the fridge, it deducts $20 from my bank account.
[10311.16s -> 10316.44s]  I am housing 15 people right now and they all have their own houses
[10316.44s -> 10318.04s]  and they're spending all my money.
[10327.38s -> 10328.02s]  I need a door.
[10328.02s -> 10329.78s]  I had a door before and it locked us all in.
[10335.26s -> 10336.46s]  They'll leave after Christmas.
[10340.46s -> 10341.74s]  Buy a real door.
[10341.74s -> 10342.54s]  Change the door.
[10342.54s -> 10343.34s]  I will.
[10343.34s -> 10344.86s]  Vloggers learn the trade.
[10344.86s -> 10345.18s]  Mean.
[10350.58s -> 10351.70s]  Somebody left.
[10351.70s -> 10352.34s]  Holy shit.
[10352.34s -> 10352.90s]  Somebody got out.
[10354.97s -> 10358.78s]  Somebody actually got out.
[10358.78s -> 10360.70s]  Where are you going is the real question.
[10360.70s -> 10372.47s]  The most festive person didn't wait for Santa Claus.
[10372.47s -> 10374.87s]  Without a door, your house is a public place.
[10378.90s -> 10379.40s]  What?
[10382.81s -> 10385.77s]  It's a public place?
[10387.99s -> 10390.95s]  Even if it is a public place, why are they here for two straight days?
[10390.95s -> 10391.67s]  They would have left.
[10407.42s -> 10409.66s]  You wouldn't stay in a public place for two days.
[10409.66s -> 10413.45s]  I have a door now.
[10416.70s -> 10417.34s]  Now click it.
[10417.90s -> 10427.05s]  What's wrong with this roof?
[10433.34s -> 10434.06s]  We need to clean up.
[10435.18s -> 10436.46s]  I'm waiting for...
[10436.46s -> 10437.34s]  I'll order another pizza.
[10437.74s -> 10438.78s]  Spiegel, stop opening the fridge.
[10438.78s -> 10439.66s]  I'm going to order a pizza.
[10452.33s -> 10453.85s]  Dog needs a bath.
[10461.29s -> 10462.65s]  Didn't I pick this up off the floor?
[10462.65s -> 10463.69s]  Why am I eating this?
[10465.29s -> 10470.74s]  How did I get 800?
[10470.74s -> 10471.78s]  Oh, because I sold the...
[10471.78s -> 10473.06s]  I sold the public bathroom.
[10475.62s -> 10479.02s]  Coffee maker is broken.
[10479.02s -> 10479.98s]  Coffee maker is broken.
[10481.90s -> 10482.62s]  Just get another one.
[10482.62s -> 10483.02s]  I don't care.
[10489.32s -> 10490.44s]  Invite a werewolf.
[10496.12s -> 10497.24s]  I need to wait for Santa to come.
[10499.40s -> 10500.68s]  Can somebody else light this though?
[10502.92s -> 10504.60s]  Click door and say no trespasses.
[10509.22s -> 10514.14s]  Well, I don't want to dis...
[10514.14s -> 10515.90s]  I don't want to disallow everybody.
[10516.62s -> 10517.98s]  This is not how you do it.
[10521.30s -> 10523.06s]  I don't want to disallow neighbors.
[10523.06s -> 10525.06s]  I want them to be able to come over, but...
[10529.00s -> 10530.28s]  Ask to leave under friendly.
[10542.38s -> 10543.34s]  Something that's really...
[10544.30s -> 10547.98s]  This whole routine of making a coffee and taking a bath.
[10549.51s -> 10551.59s]  My water bill is going to be crazy this week.
[10551.59s -> 10552.07s]  This month.
[10554.98s -> 10556.82s]  I don't understand how none of them have gone to sleep.
[10556.82s -> 10558.02s]  None of them have slept in two days.
[10561.58s -> 10563.02s]  Lord is a lazy sim.
[10563.02s -> 10564.30s]  They like watching TV.
[10568.41s -> 10569.69s]  All right, let me do the dog a bath.
[10573.46s -> 10574.66s]  Stop watching TV and getting...
[10574.66s -> 10575.46s]  You got to do some stuff.
[10576.66s -> 10577.06s]  Clean up.
[10582.57s -> 10583.05s]  Take a bath.
[10586.36s -> 10587.16s]  Exercising.
[10595.56s -> 10598.15s]  I guess you're going to open the fridge and take something out.
[10598.15s -> 10599.27s]  You're going to charge me $20.
[10599.27s -> 10608.34s]  Look, I'm giving the dog a bath right now.
[10608.34s -> 10608.66s]  You can't...
[10617.70s -> 10618.98s]  Is Santa actually going to appear?
[10618.98s -> 10620.50s]  Yeah, if you have a fireplace, which I do.
[10620.50s -> 10621.54s]  And it's 8 p.m.
[10621.54s -> 10623.14s]  That's the only reason why I haven't kicked everybody out yet.
[10623.14s -> 10623.46s]  Or try...
[10623.46s -> 10624.98s]  I mean, they're just here.
[10627.14s -> 10628.10s]  I need to go to sleep.
[10628.10s -> 10630.90s]  Sleep.
[10633.06s -> 10633.46s]  Sleep.
[10633.46s -> 10634.50s]  Move out of the way.
[10634.50s -> 10635.14s]  Everyone get out of the way.
[10635.14s -> 10636.02s]  You can talk in the other room.
[10640.79s -> 10641.51s]  Stop.
[10641.51s -> 10642.47s]  Get away from my bed.
[10645.67s -> 10648.52s]  What a rush.
[10648.52s -> 10651.08s]  The boost of adrenaline is making Lord feel amazing.
[10651.08s -> 10654.84s]  Should he finally embrace it with his astonishingly sculpted arms that he likes fitness?
[10654.84s -> 10655.08s]  No.
[10656.63s -> 10656.87s]  No.
[10658.74s -> 10659.38s]  What does that mean?
[10668.02s -> 10668.98s]  Okay, this person's cooking.
[10671.11s -> 10672.31s]  Should we sing together again?
[10676.14s -> 10679.02s]  Oh, kookaloy y'all meat.
[10679.02s -> 10679.74s]  Oh.
[10679.74s -> 10681.10s]  Plus one future cube?
[10683.10s -> 10683.34s]  What?
[10684.06s -> 10686.33s]  I got a future cube?
[10689.69s -> 10694.22s]  Quick yourself.
[10695.77s -> 10697.93s]  Guys, there is no make people leave.
[10699.83s -> 10701.19s]  The game is broken.
[10701.19s -> 10704.95s]  And I was waiting for Santa to show up before I reload the game and kick everybody out.
[10704.95s -> 10712.65s]  Somebody else left.
[10712.65s -> 10714.25s]  We were so close to Santa.
[10717.05s -> 10718.01s]  All right, so the cube...
[10718.01s -> 10718.65s]  Where's the cube?
[10720.25s -> 10721.21s]  Tag, tag.
[10728.74s -> 10732.97s]  It's on the counter.
[10735.45s -> 10736.09s]  Everybody ready?
[10740.25s -> 10741.93s]  Santa will be showing up very soon.
[10745.45s -> 10746.57s]  I was going to say happy birthday.
[10757.61s -> 10776.25s]  Happy birthday to Santa.
[10776.25s -> 10777.61s]  Worst party ever.
[10781.05s -> 10785.21s]  Will he be brave enough to throw another party after how badly this one went?
[10785.53s -> 10787.74s]  Tag, tag.
[10787.74s -> 10793.11s]  But Santa hasn't even showed up yet.
[10793.11s -> 10796.95s]  They're all actually leaving right before the big moment where Santa comes.
[10798.86s -> 10800.62s]  You've been here for three days.
[10801.42s -> 10802.54s]  Three days.
[10802.54s -> 10807.02s]  At least you're still here.
[10812.84s -> 10814.12s]  I'm sorry for that party.
[10814.12s -> 10814.76s]  It was so bad.
[10816.86s -> 10818.22s]  It was an awful party.
[10819.62s -> 10820.18s]  What do you need?
[10825.30s -> 10825.94s]  What's wrong now?
[10825.94s -> 10830.97s]  Okay.
[10830.97s -> 10833.45s]  How about let's sing another song.
[10842.49s -> 10844.89s]  And sing pop songs duet with other Sims.
[10850.41s -> 10850.73s]  Hold on.
[10850.73s -> 10851.93s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[10851.93s -> 10853.13s]  This is not we're not doing that.
[10855.69s -> 10856.65s]  Give a Winterfest gift.
[10859.14s -> 10860.50s]  Oh, all I have is dog shit.
[10860.50s -> 10861.14s]  All right.
[10861.14s -> 10864.25s]  A ball of wooden children's toy.
[10864.25s -> 10864.81s]  An apple.
[10865.37s -> 10867.59s]  A toddler's book.
[10867.59s -> 10872.95s]  Or the fruitcake that's been old that I made that I got for a welcome present like a month ago.
[10872.95s -> 10876.34s]  Which one?
[10876.34s -> 10876.82s]  The apple.
[10877.38s -> 10879.48s]  Imagine getting an apple for a present.
[10883.32s -> 10884.60s]  Just one apple.
[10884.60s -> 10886.79s]  A single apple.
[10886.79s -> 10890.20s]  Maybe the wooden toy.
[10900.89s -> 10901.45s]  Merry Christmas.
[10902.73s -> 10903.21s]  What's in it?
[10904.97s -> 10905.69s]  My specialty.
[10908.95s -> 10916.63s]  You know how much this fucking place is worth?
[10917.98s -> 10918.78s]  Where's a lot of money?
[10918.78s -> 10919.26s]  Out on the beach.
[10927.40s -> 10928.36s]  Ask what happened.
[10929.82s -> 10932.22s]  Can you turn the stove on or whatever?
[10932.22s -> 10935.90s]  Hey, Blark, you're so notorious that one of my unscrupulous friends has been asking to meet you.
[10935.90s -> 10936.86s]  Can I give them your number?
[10936.86s -> 10938.38s]  What do you mean notorious?
[10938.38s -> 10941.83s]  What does that mean?
[10947.14s -> 10947.38s]  No.
[10950.17s -> 10950.89s]  Oh, coffee.
[10950.89s -> 10951.61s]  Yep.
[10951.61s -> 10951.85s]  Okay.
[10951.85s -> 10954.09s]  We only have a couple hours till Santa shows up.
[10954.09s -> 10964.87s]  He's pissed.
[10964.87s -> 10970.94s]  Let's do, um, let's talk about who's laugh together.
[10970.94s -> 10972.14s]  Belly laugh.
[10972.14s -> 10979.00s]  Santa's going to show up very soon.
[10988.84s -> 10993.59s]  This dog looks like a sock puppet.
[10998.55s -> 11009.42s]  Okay, how about, um, how about, um, something just friendly.
[11009.42s -> 11009.90s]  New show.
[11009.90s -> 11010.78s]  There's a new show on TV.
[11011.58s -> 11012.22s]  Let's talk about the new show.
[11013.42s -> 11014.38s]  That makes sense, right?
[11022.54s -> 11023.02s]  All right.
[11024.38s -> 11025.34s]  All we drink is coffee.
[11029.82s -> 11031.02s]  I have to extinguish your fire.
[11033.58s -> 11033.99s]  Okay.
[11035.61s -> 11037.69s]  How about, um, complain about Winterfest.
[11037.69s -> 11038.41s]  I wouldn't want to know.
[11038.41s -> 11039.53s]  Why would I do that?
[11039.53s -> 11042.73s]  Having been a personal emergency and have to leave.
[11042.73s -> 11042.97s]  What?
[11044.55s -> 11045.03s]  What is it?
[11045.03s -> 11045.83s]  Emergency?
[11059.16s -> 11059.48s]  What?
[11060.04s -> 11061.67s]  Hey, I've heard a lot about you.
[11061.67s -> 11062.87s]  Mostly bad things, but that's okay.
[11062.87s -> 11064.55s]  People usually don't like me either.
[11064.55s -> 11065.75s]  We should hang out sometime.
[11066.39s -> 11071.91s]  Want to come over for Christmas?
[11071.91s -> 11082.15s]  Who was that?
[11082.15s -> 11084.87s]  Who was that?
[11093.69s -> 11095.13s]  Santa's going to show up in two hours.
[11095.13s -> 11095.61s]  Come on over.
[11102.20s -> 11103.40s]  Grace will be right over.
[11103.40s -> 11104.04s]  All right.
[11104.04s -> 11105.29s]  Quick.
[11105.29s -> 11106.17s]  I got to use the bathroom.
[11106.17s -> 11109.21s]  No, don't go to bed after inviting some drink coffee and go to the bathroom.
[11110.01s -> 11114.09s]  That was quick.
[11114.09s -> 11116.65s]  You didn't, I didn't invite you in.
[11116.65s -> 11117.61s]  We just walked in the house.
[11119.13s -> 11120.17s]  Oh my goodness.
[11125.75s -> 11130.87s]  How are you doing?
[11130.87s -> 11134.62s]  All right.
[11134.62s -> 11135.58s]  What about like mischief?
[11137.24s -> 11138.60s]  Incoming phone call.
[11138.60s -> 11141.37s]  Hey, blogger.
[11141.37s -> 11145.69s]  I've been thinking about getting to know Nina Caliente better as a friend.
[11145.69s -> 11147.51s]  Do you think the two of us should?
[11147.51s -> 11150.62s]  Why are you calling me?
[11150.62s -> 11152.14s]  Don't, don't ever call this number again.
[11153.58s -> 11154.36s]  All right.
[11154.36s -> 11156.20s]  Let's make a coffee and then we'll be ready for Santa.
[11159.16s -> 11163.75s]  Said anything.
[11169.32s -> 11170.12s]  This is weird.
[11194.70s -> 11199.29s]  Get out.
[11199.29s -> 11199.69s]  Get out.
[11200.79s -> 11201.19s]  Get out of here.
[11201.19s -> 11201.67s]  Get out.
[11201.67s -> 11203.18s]  Oh dear.
[11203.18s -> 11203.90s]  Get out of here.
[11203.90s -> 11215.54s]  Wait, Santa's gonna be here in an hour.
[11215.54s -> 11216.42s]  Where's Santa?
[11216.42s -> 11216.90s]  8 p.m.
[11216.90s -> 11217.30s]  Right?
[11217.30s -> 11217.98s]  Quick.
[11217.98s -> 11225.75s]  I gotta, I gotta go to sleep just for a minute.
[11225.75s -> 11226.15s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11226.15s -> 11226.47s]  Don't leave.
[11226.47s -> 11226.95s]  Don't leave.
[11226.95s -> 11228.86s]  Just pick the shit up.
[11228.86s -> 11246.81s]  She picked the shit up with her hand.
[11246.81s -> 11247.21s]  All right.
[11247.21s -> 11251.22s]  Santa's coming.
[11251.22s -> 11251.78s]  8 p.m.
[11251.78s -> 11257.69s]  Here it comes.
[11257.69s -> 11257.93s]  Okay.
[11259.48s -> 11260.52s]  Santa!
[11260.52s -> 11266.81s]  What's he putting down Santa?
[11266.81s -> 11266.97s]  Okay.
[11266.97s -> 11268.09s]  We got a present from Santa.
[11273.02s -> 11276.47s]  Put your, Santa is in the room.
[11276.47s -> 11277.27s]  Put your phone down.
[11279.67s -> 11281.19s]  He's putting tons of shit here.
[11282.46s -> 11283.34s]  Oh my goodness.
[11286.41s -> 11287.69s]  And all those motherfuckers left.
[11289.14s -> 11289.46s]  Eat them.
[11292.01s -> 11292.25s]  Okay.
[11292.25s -> 11292.65s]  Okay.
[11292.65s -> 11292.97s]  Okay.
[11292.97s -> 11293.29s]  Okay.
[11293.29s -> 11293.61s]  Hold on.
[11301.27s -> 11302.15s]  There's cheese pizza here.
[11308.89s -> 11309.45s]  Okay.
[11309.45s -> 11310.49s]  Let's sing about Winterfest.
[11318.97s -> 11319.93s]  Wait, he got a gun.
[11323.13s -> 11326.81s]  Oh my God.
[11326.81s -> 11328.65s]  I thought he shot me in the face with a gun.
[11329.93s -> 11330.33s]  Oh my.
[11332.97s -> 11334.57s]  That was fucking crazy.
[11335.61s -> 11336.89s]  I, I thought I.
[11336.89s -> 11337.29s]  Okay.
[11337.29s -> 11338.09s]  We're good.
[11338.09s -> 11338.49s]  Pizza.
[11344.18s -> 11344.82s]  All right, Santa.
[11344.82s -> 11345.22s]  Stick around.
[11347.90s -> 11348.70s]  Let's get that pizza.
[11357.40s -> 11358.44s]  Why does this keep happening?
[11363.70s -> 11364.66s]  The door is locked?
[11365.22s -> 11366.98s]  People have been walking in and out of this door.
[11375.99s -> 11377.59s]  Hector Laurent is not here.
[11378.23s -> 11378.63s]  Is he?
[11380.26s -> 11380.74s]  Where is he?
[11380.74s -> 11392.60s]  He's hiding somewhere?
[11392.60s -> 11393.80s]  Santa, can you get the pizza?
[11422.57s -> 11423.69s]  This is fucked.
[11423.69s -> 11424.57s]  This is fucked up.
[11429.51s -> 11430.95s]  This is like creepy.
[11430.95s -> 11432.31s]  This is creepy.
[11432.31s -> 11433.43s]  It's actually kind of scary.
[11435.11s -> 11439.69s]  We can't get the pizza again.
[11439.69s -> 11440.73s]  He's going to leave it on the ground
[11440.73s -> 11442.57s]  and Santa's going to take it and then leave.
[11442.57s -> 11446.15s]  And then I can, I'm going to go back to work tomorrow.
[11446.15s -> 11447.59s]  This nightmare can finally end.
[11448.31s -> 11449.78s]  But there are presents in here.
[11450.42s -> 11457.18s]  Come open presents.
[11457.90s -> 11458.38s]  What did I get?
[11461.80s -> 11462.76s]  Santa put these in here.
[11465.38s -> 11467.14s]  Plus one wonder game.
[11467.14s -> 11468.50s]  Ooh, cool.
[11468.50s -> 11469.62s]  That's it.
[11469.94s -> 11470.66s]  Oh, that was rude.
[11471.53s -> 11472.25s]  That was rude.
[11472.25s -> 11473.21s]  What I meant to say was
[11473.21s -> 11475.53s]  thank you so much, Santa, for the gift.
[11475.53s -> 11477.69s]  I can't get the pizza.
[11478.74s -> 11480.02s]  I can't get the pizza.
[11480.82s -> 11483.06s]  I'm locked inside of my house, apparently.
[11485.35s -> 11485.83s]  I can't.
[11492.55s -> 11493.83s]  He's complaining about the trash.
[11493.83s -> 11494.63s]  He just put it there.
[11495.91s -> 11497.19s]  Well, let me go ahead and get the pizza now.
[11504.78s -> 11506.22s]  You know what?
[11506.22s -> 11507.02s]  I'm insulting you.
[11508.38s -> 11510.14s]  Come back here so I can insult you.
[11510.14s -> 11517.59s]  You going to get a slice?
[11517.59s -> 11518.23s]  I'm going to bed.
[11521.99s -> 11524.26s]  I give you a Winterfest gift.
[11524.26s -> 11525.46s]  A fresh coffee.
[11538.62s -> 11540.89s]  There's an alien.
[11540.89s -> 11546.63s]  Why did I play the alien song?
[11546.63s -> 11552.42s]  All right, put this away.
[11552.42s -> 11553.14s]  Put it in the fridge.
[11553.14s -> 11554.82s]  Because can we?
[11554.82s -> 11555.78s]  Okay, can I finally?
[11558.01s -> 11559.67s]  All right, we're good.
[11559.67s -> 11560.55s]  Everybody can relax.
[11561.27s -> 11563.59s]  That was strange.
[11565.83s -> 11572.97s]  But it's time to get back to the real life here.
[11572.97s -> 11574.25s]  Winterfest was really fun.
[11574.97s -> 11576.01s]  I got some cool stuff.
[11577.61s -> 11579.85s]  Um, we're going to let's clean up.
[11581.05s -> 11581.69s]  Feed the dog.
[11582.41s -> 11582.97s]  Take a bath.
[11583.90s -> 11584.94s]  Clean this place up.
[11584.94s -> 11590.09s]  Everything looks okay.
[11590.97s -> 11592.90s]  All right.
[11592.90s -> 11594.82s]  Well, I don't know where you're going, but whatever.
[11594.82s -> 11596.02s]  Host another party.
[11596.02s -> 11601.51s]  No, not another party.
[11601.51s -> 11602.71s]  I need to rest.
[11602.71s -> 11604.95s]  And then I got to get up because I have work.
[11604.95s -> 11609.74s]  I got work tomorrow.
[11609.74s -> 11613.67s]  Work starts in this morning and relax.
[11613.67s -> 11619.82s]  I think your door porch is not big enough for two people.
[11619.82s -> 11622.74s]  Is that what the problem is?
[11622.74s -> 11630.02s]  The dude put the trash on the ground and then complained that I had like a dirty house.
[11630.26s -> 11633.62s]  Dude, you that's what's going on.
[11633.62s -> 11653.24s]  Need to make it bigger.
[11653.24s -> 11657.88s]  Should I just get rid of it and put hold on?
[11657.88s -> 11660.54s]  What if I make like a little like, yeah, okay.
[11660.54s -> 11661.42s]  This is what I'm going to do.
[11661.42s -> 11665.34s]  I'm going to build out the wall here.
[11665.34s -> 11666.14s]  I have a thousand bucks.
[11666.14s -> 11667.18s]  I think I have enough to do it.
[11667.18s -> 11672.62s]  Just like a little thing, right?
[11672.62s -> 11687.37s]  How do I make just like a little thingy?
[11687.37s -> 11688.01s]  Make a pool?
[11688.01s -> 11688.81s]  Build a deck?
[11688.81s -> 11690.09s]  I don't have enough money.
[11690.09s -> 11692.49s]  Platform.
[11692.49s -> 11698.44s]  Okay, so I'm going to do rounded platform.
[11698.44s -> 11711.00s]  This doesn't look right.
[11711.00s -> 11712.87s]  This is not right.
[11712.87s -> 11715.53s]  This is wrong.
[11715.53s -> 11716.17s]  Bottom right.
[11719.29s -> 11720.57s]  How do I remove this?
[11720.57s -> 11725.43s]  Okay, so square deck.
[11725.43s -> 11728.14s]  But this is a big cube.
[11728.86s -> 11738.31s]  I don't understand.
[11739.11s -> 11746.97s]  Oh, that's wrong.
[11748.33s -> 11750.31s]  Why is this so fucked up?
[11750.31s -> 11752.78s]  Did I skip to the fridge?
[11752.78s -> 11754.14s]  Wait, why is a fridge in here?
[11754.78s -> 11755.78s]  How do I undo?
[11760.01s -> 11760.57s]  Controls it.
[11761.21s -> 11761.61s]  I can't.
[11762.95s -> 11764.15s]  It's like going into the house.
[11764.87s -> 11779.37s]  Is the movement that cheat that I turned on screwing this up?
[11795.56s -> 11796.12s]  Oh my God.
[11796.12s -> 11796.68s]  Don't do that.
[11798.98s -> 11799.22s]  Wait.
[11800.49s -> 11801.13s]  Yeah, do that.
[11818.20s -> 11819.08s]  Oh my God.
[11819.08s -> 11823.64s]  Okay, I actually have a house now.
[11824.28s -> 11825.24s]  Oh my goodness.
[11827.08s -> 11827.64s]  Thank God.
[11828.20s -> 11830.89s]  I don't know why I was up so high.
[11830.89s -> 11833.90s]  All right, so now I got to make an opening here.
[11834.46s -> 11837.13s]  A little gate.
[11837.13s -> 11856.38s]  How do I put a gate so they can walk in?
[11856.38s -> 11870.50s]  It's kind of big.
[11871.06s -> 11880.41s]  Okay, I want brick.
[11880.41s -> 11882.74s]  There we are.
[11882.74s -> 11890.70s]  Hey, look at that.
[11890.70s -> 11892.71s]  Okay, nice.
[11893.59s -> 11895.03s]  Oh my God.
[11895.03s -> 11897.42s]  Okay, hold on here.
[11898.14s -> 11912.17s]  Looks good.
[11912.17s -> 11916.74s]  All right, now I actually am not up in the air.
[11916.74s -> 11918.81s]  I have a little area out here.
[11918.81s -> 11920.09s]  I can put like some plants and shit.
[11920.09s -> 11923.13s]  All right, now it's time to get back to reality.
[11923.13s -> 11924.07s]  Hey.
[11924.07s -> 11929.08s]  Things looking good.
[11930.84s -> 11932.04s]  I'm blocking the Winterfest stuff.
[11932.04s -> 11933.88s]  Yeah, but it's over.
[11933.88s -> 11934.92s]  I did everything.
[11934.92s -> 11940.52s]  Some sleep.
[11940.52s -> 11943.94s]  Go to the bathroom, get some sleep, and then take a shower.
[11943.94s -> 11950.81s]  What the hell is that?
[11950.81s -> 11957.30s]  All right, sleep, get up, have a quick breakfast, and then get to work.
[11957.30s -> 11960.33s]  I need a computer eventually.
[11960.33s -> 11962.09s]  After I get back from work, I'm going to get a computer
[11962.09s -> 11968.47s]  because I have some secret agent.
[11972.20s -> 11973.24s]  I got to get this.
[11973.24s -> 11974.36s]  This is way too goopy.
[11974.36s -> 11976.66s]  It was weird.
[11976.66s -> 11977.62s]  This is super goopy.
[11977.62s -> 11979.30s]  It's spreading too much.
[11979.30s -> 11982.50s]  This is goopy.
[11984.39s -> 11985.03s]  Oh my God.
[11985.03s -> 11985.43s]  Why is it?
[11991.10s -> 11991.74s]  That one's goopy.
[11991.74s -> 11992.30s]  I don't like that one.
[11993.74s -> 11995.26s]  Winterfest was, what did it say?
[11995.26s -> 11996.46s]  Winterfest was pretty good.
[11996.46s -> 11999.10s]  Laura got to do a lot of things he wanted to do, but not everything.
[11999.10s -> 12000.54s]  Next year, he hopes to do even more.
[12003.32s -> 12003.80s]  That's fine.
[12003.80s -> 12006.68s]  Okay, get some sleep.
[12006.68s -> 12011.61s]  You need to eat, and then I'm going to get to bed,
[12011.61s -> 12014.57s]  and I got to get up in five hours to go to work.
[12014.57s -> 12016.10s]  What's wrong with me?
[12016.10s -> 12018.38s]  Something was gross.
[12021.75s -> 12024.54s]  How do you upgrade the bed?
[12025.91s -> 12026.47s]  All right, let's go.
[12027.59s -> 12028.39s]  Geez.
[12028.39s -> 12037.35s]  We're good.
[12037.35s -> 12042.42s]  Starts in about an hour.
[12042.42s -> 12043.43s]  Should be fine.
[12048.70s -> 12051.18s]  Late for work?
[12051.18s -> 12051.58s]  What do you mean?
[12051.58s -> 12052.22s]  What?
[12052.22s -> 12055.43s]  Did I just miss work?
[12055.43s -> 12060.70s]  Who's calling me?
[12060.70s -> 12064.31s]  Laura, thank you for suggesting I hang out with Nina Caliente.
[12064.31s -> 12065.67s]  We had a spectacular time.
[12065.67s -> 12066.87s]  I literally hung up on you.
[12066.87s -> 12067.75s]  I hung up on that guy.
[12068.31s -> 12072.12s]  Okay, we're good.
[12072.12s -> 12079.00s]  That person made that up.
[12079.00s -> 12079.72s]  Uncomfortable.
[12080.52s -> 12081.48s]  Too many Sims.
[12084.97s -> 12086.15s]  Is there coffee brewing?
[12087.03s -> 12088.23s]  All right, 123 bucks.
[12089.62s -> 12090.82s]  Clean up the coffee maker.
[12092.18s -> 12095.14s]  Take a shower, and then I need to get a computer,
[12095.14s -> 12097.38s]  and I need to do this, whatever the skill is.
[12097.38s -> 12098.74s]  Browse intelligence.
[12098.74s -> 12099.86s]  And I'm ready for promotion.
[12099.86s -> 12104.66s]  Look at this.
[12104.66s -> 12105.14s]  Oh, hello.
[12105.70s -> 12113.59s]  Bathroom shower.
[12113.59s -> 12116.39s]  Now, I need a little desk and a computer.
[12116.39s -> 12118.12s]  Can I afford it?
[12126.90s -> 12128.50s]  Oh, why do I have a slice of pizza?
[12128.50s -> 12129.62s]  And what inventory?
[12131.11s -> 12134.41s]  Made by Titus Peterson.
[12134.41s -> 12141.51s]  Who is that?
[12148.04s -> 12154.23s]  Okay, let's go with the
[12155.45s -> 12157.21s]  needed desk right here.
[12157.21s -> 12158.23s]  Just a shitty one.
[12158.23s -> 12160.15s]  Just little ones so I can use the computer.
[12160.15s -> 12161.88s]  It's the cheapest one they have.
[12164.07s -> 12165.11s]  Oh, my God.
[12165.91s -> 12167.59s]  It's like a half-life item.
[12167.59s -> 12169.03s]  All right, that's fine.
[12176.02s -> 12176.74s]  And here we are.
[12177.90s -> 12178.94s]  Desktop computer.
[12179.58s -> 12183.69s]  I only have 100 bucks and I need a seat.
[12184.25s -> 12192.90s]  I don't think I can afford a nice chair to dry though.
[12192.90s -> 12198.12s]  Okay, that's fine.
[12198.12s -> 12202.31s]  All right, now I'm gonna take a quick shower,
[12202.31s -> 12205.64s]  and I'm gonna do the whatever this is.
[12205.64s -> 12207.48s]  I need to practice intelligence.
[12207.48s -> 12221.75s]  Take a shower.
[12221.75s -> 12223.27s]  You seem pretty happy.
[12223.27s -> 12226.57s]  All right, hunger.
[12226.57s -> 12229.37s]  I'll eat something quick.
[12229.37s -> 12233.30s]  Wait, I have pizza in the fridge, right?
[12233.30s -> 12241.10s]  Leftovers.
[12241.10s -> 12242.78s]  Something smells.
[12242.78s -> 12245.74s]  This fridge is steaming with smelly stuff.
[12245.74s -> 12248.06s]  What is it?
[12248.70s -> 12249.58s]  Can I look in the fridge?
[12250.44s -> 12255.42s]  I'm not eating the problem, right?
[12255.42s -> 12257.10s]  Clean out spoiled food.
[12257.10s -> 12269.14s]  Oh, God, it's fine.
[12269.78s -> 12273.26s]  Okay, better.
[12274.41s -> 12276.25s]  Now it's time.
[12276.25s -> 12283.40s]  Computer security settings.
[12283.40s -> 12283.88s]  Career.
[12287.43s -> 12288.39s]  Practice, where is it?
[12290.33s -> 12290.97s]  Play game.
[12290.97s -> 12292.01s]  Vampire secrets.
[12293.42s -> 12293.90s]  Where is it?
[12297.46s -> 12297.78s]  Web?
[12300.01s -> 12301.61s]  Okay, browse the intelligence database.
[12301.61s -> 12302.25s]  There it is.
[12302.25s -> 12306.81s]  I'm getting a call from Santa Claus.
[12306.81s -> 12311.05s]  Hey, blogger, I think I have a crush on Lilith Vator.
[12311.05s -> 12312.17s]  Do you think it's worth a try?
[12320.41s -> 12320.81s]  I don't know.
[12320.81s -> 12321.13s]  Sure.
[12321.13s -> 12321.77s]  I don't know.
[12321.77s -> 12322.49s]  Why are you calling me?
[12325.34s -> 12326.38s]  All right, I gotta do this.
[12326.38s -> 12327.02s]  All right.
[12327.02s -> 12333.82s]  Just started.
[12333.82s -> 12334.54s]  What is he saying?
[12336.06s -> 12336.54s]  Does he want...
[12337.34s -> 12337.98s]  What do you want?
[12337.98s -> 12338.54s]  What does he want?
[12338.54s -> 12339.82s]  You love another dog?
[12339.82s -> 12340.46s]  What was that?
[12340.46s -> 12343.18s]  What does that mean?
[12343.18s -> 12356.38s]  I'll give you a bath in a second.
[12356.38s -> 12357.34s]  25% done.
[12357.34s -> 12357.66s]  Hold on.
[12366.47s -> 12369.03s]  Ooh, possible lead.
[12369.03s -> 12371.82s]  The discovery of some uncovered intelligence
[12371.82s -> 12374.65s]  may help make the next day of work a bit easier.
[12374.65s -> 12375.21s]  All right.
[12375.21s -> 12376.65s]  I'm in a good mood right now.
[12376.65s -> 12379.26s]  That's cool.
[12379.26s -> 12384.46s]  100% done, right?
[12384.46s -> 12386.70s]  And get to bed early so you get promotion.
[12386.70s -> 12393.35s]  I'm gonna give the dog a bath.
[12393.35s -> 12396.65s]  Don't go to bed yet.
[12396.65s -> 12397.05s]  Not yet.
[12397.77s -> 12402.73s]  All right, we're gonna play fetch
[12402.73s -> 12403.61s]  and then I'm gonna give you a bath.
[12406.87s -> 12408.12s]  He's so dirty.
[12411.80s -> 12412.84s]  Pet training skill.
[12412.84s -> 12413.80s]  Jujube?
[12413.80s -> 12415.24s]  Do they even train dogs?
[12419.19s -> 12420.39s]  Dodo is a smart dog.
[12422.09s -> 12423.77s]  They're easy to train and learn quickly.
[12425.94s -> 12426.26s]  Really?
[12434.92s -> 12435.96s]  What do you want?
[12435.96s -> 12437.00s]  Play fetch?
[12437.00s -> 12437.72s]  Let's play fetch.
[12443.22s -> 12443.54s]  There it is.
[12448.73s -> 12449.85s]  Are they flies?
[12453.08s -> 12453.74s]  Go get it.
[12454.30s -> 12457.05s]  You gotta pick it up.
[12457.05s -> 12460.89s]  Take a look.
[12463.88s -> 12464.36s]  Champy?
[12465.16s -> 12467.19s]  Oh, you got it.
[12469.18s -> 12469.58s]  Nice.
[12469.58s -> 12470.22s]  Excellent dog.
[12470.86s -> 12474.15s]  I'm gonna give you a big treat for that one.
[12475.70s -> 12476.18s]  Jujube?
[12476.18s -> 12476.58s]  I'll spot.
[12479.86s -> 12481.59s]  Get it.
[12481.59s -> 12482.39s]  Here's a big treat.
[12485.75s -> 12491.86s]  Who's this?
[12491.86s -> 12492.34s]  Loretta?
[12493.22s -> 12493.62s]  Warrant?
[12496.74s -> 12497.94s]  Is this a public beach?
[12503.69s -> 12505.37s]  Am I on a public beach?
[12509.98s -> 12511.18s]  Because people are just kind of...
[12511.18s -> 12512.86s]  This is not my private land.
[12514.10s -> 12515.78s]  I don't get like this section of the beach.
[12516.34s -> 12517.85s]  How does that work?
[12517.85s -> 12520.87s]  How does it work if this is my house?
[12520.87s -> 12523.03s]  Do I own this part of the water?
[12523.03s -> 12524.30s]  I don't know how this works.
[12524.30s -> 12525.98s]  I don't know how beach front property works.
[12530.06s -> 12531.26s]  Gate this beach off.
[12532.52s -> 12534.44s]  Just put a whole gate here.
[12534.44s -> 12538.20s]  So you just went swimming.
[12541.19s -> 12543.62s]  I need to put a gate here.
[12543.62s -> 12544.58s]  Watch the dog.
[12544.58s -> 12545.70s]  I keep trying to.
[12551.38s -> 12552.82s]  Okay, go to learn how to fetch.
[12552.82s -> 12556.06s]  Nice job.
[12556.06s -> 12557.02s]  Give the dog bath.
[12559.29s -> 12560.41s]  All right, come on, let's go.
[12560.41s -> 12566.60s]  It's not your beach.
[12566.60s -> 12575.51s]  All right, there we go.
[12582.65s -> 12583.69s]  Dog's being very calm.
[12586.31s -> 12587.19s]  Such a good dog.
[12590.07s -> 12591.11s]  I need energy.
[12591.11s -> 12592.55s]  All right, smelly pet.
[12592.55s -> 12594.38s]  Let's take care of that.
[12598.38s -> 12599.66s]  Get an auto feeder.
[12600.62s -> 12601.58s]  Actually, that's a good idea.
[12603.37s -> 12604.65s]  But I need to save some money.
[12611.21s -> 12612.89s]  All right, time for bed.
[12612.89s -> 12613.45s]  Get up.
[12613.45s -> 12615.53s]  I have my job completed.
[12615.53s -> 12619.40s]  Get some sleep.
[12619.40s -> 12623.40s]  All right, let's go.
[12623.40s -> 12624.28s]  Good day.
[12624.28s -> 12630.36s]  Why is my neck so white?
[12630.36s -> 12632.14s]  Because the way that my...
[12632.14s -> 12633.66s]  I don't know, the way that my camera's lighting.
[12633.66s -> 12634.30s]  I don't have...
[12634.30s -> 12634.70s]  I'm not...
[12634.70s -> 12634.94s]  I don't...
[12635.74s -> 12642.22s]  I want to have a night on the town.
[12642.86s -> 12648.73s]  Local businesses want to show some customer appreciation
[12648.73s -> 12650.33s]  by offering free food and drinks.
[12650.33s -> 12651.85s]  Time to get out of the house and visit a venue.
[12652.49s -> 12656.81s]  All right, so after work, I'll go do it.
[12656.81s -> 12658.54s]  I'm in a bad mood.
[12658.54s -> 12661.35s]  Oh, here's another hack thing.
[12661.35s -> 12661.99s]  Yeah, hack it.
[12662.71s -> 12665.27s]  You just can't beat this one.
[12665.27s -> 12669.13s]  Finally, Blorg has to admit defeat to his boss.
[12669.13s -> 12671.13s]  And turns out he just had the wrong password.
[12671.13s -> 12676.46s]  His boss is not amused.
[12676.46s -> 12677.10s]  Really?
[12677.10s -> 12679.02s]  What did I...
[12679.02s -> 12683.08s]  I ate something at work.
[12683.08s -> 12684.68s]  New Year's Eve is tomorrow.
[12684.68s -> 12693.48s]  No, I'm going out for New Year's Eve.
[12693.48s -> 12694.12s]  I'm going out.
[12694.12s -> 12694.92s]  I'm not staying in.
[12694.92s -> 12696.04s]  I'm not putting a...
[12696.04s -> 12696.84s]  No, I'm going out.
[12697.48s -> 12707.38s]  I'm not throwing a New Year's Eve party.
[12707.38s -> 12711.72s]  I keep getting calls from Santa again.
[12711.72s -> 12713.56s]  Remember when we talked about Lilith Vitora?
[12713.56s -> 12715.00s]  We went on a very nice date.
[12715.56s -> 12717.16s]  Congratulations, Santa.
[12717.16s -> 12717.80s]  I hope it went well.
[12723.22s -> 12724.60s]  Promotion.
[12725.24s -> 12727.40s]  Promoted to intelligence researcher.
[12727.40s -> 12734.44s]  He doesn't like this career.
[12734.44s -> 12738.38s]  How long has it been?
[12738.38s -> 12740.54s]  Blorg can't help but wonder if this is the career right for him.
[12740.54s -> 12741.26s]  One thing is for sure.
[12741.26s -> 12742.94s]  There needs to be some kind of change.
[12742.94s -> 12748.23s]  I just got promoted.
[12748.23s -> 12750.47s]  Oh my God, I forgot to go to Star Wars Land.
[12750.47s -> 12751.27s]  I completely forgot.
[12751.27s -> 12752.95s]  I'm going to Star Wars Land for New Year's Eve.
[12752.95s -> 12754.87s]  That's what I'm doing for my New Year's Eve party.
[12754.87s -> 12758.52s]  Where am I?
[12758.52s -> 12759.40s]  Right there I am.
[12759.40s -> 12762.62s]  That's a great idea.
[12765.64s -> 12780.14s]  That's genuinely a good idea.
[12780.14s -> 12780.94s]  It sucks, by the way.
[12780.94s -> 12781.82s]  It's the worst DLC.
[12782.46s -> 12784.98s]  Well, we're only going to go for like a few minutes.
[12784.98s -> 12785.86s]  Not for long.
[12785.86s -> 12790.28s]  Where'd the dog go?
[12790.84s -> 12793.05s]  We're going to clean that up.
[12796.47s -> 12797.19s]  I'm going to throw it away.
[12797.19s -> 12797.67s]  Don't pick it up.
[12797.67s -> 12797.91s]  I don't...
[12797.91s -> 12798.63s]  Do I have...
[12798.63s -> 12799.99s]  Do I have a trash barrel?
[12804.63s -> 12805.59s]  You have to throw...
[12805.59s -> 12807.99s]  I haven't gotten the mail the whole time of the plan.
[12807.99s -> 12811.29s]  Don't you need a trash barrel for outside?
[12816.23s -> 12817.11s]  Oh my goodness.
[12821.35s -> 12823.67s]  $220 for that?
[12825.53s -> 12826.01s]  You gotta be...
[12826.01s -> 12826.89s]  Where's my mailbox?
[12832.04s -> 12833.16s]  Auto-sell.
[12833.16s -> 12833.96s]  Lot.
[12833.96s -> 12834.28s]  Total.
[12834.28s -> 12835.80s]  I have 400 bucks that I owe.
[12835.80s -> 12840.34s]  How much money do I owe?
[12840.34s -> 12840.58s]  What?
[12841.30s -> 12843.91s]  Whatever.
[12843.91s -> 12844.55s]  I'm just not going to pay it.
[12848.25s -> 12849.29s]  Ask for autograph?
[12857.11s -> 12857.43s]  Ooh.
[12857.43s -> 12857.67s]  All right.
[12857.67s -> 12858.55s]  What's my goal?
[12859.11s -> 12861.75s]  I need level two logic skill.
[12862.31s -> 12866.15s]  What am I doing?
[12866.15s -> 12885.37s]  Does programming do logic?
[12891.61s -> 12893.05s]  No, it's programming.
[12893.05s -> 12894.57s]  I probably need programming, though.
[12900.65s -> 12901.69s]  I definitely need programming.
[12907.42s -> 12908.62s]  I mean, I'm a secret agent.
[12913.74s -> 12915.42s]  So is this Night on the Town?
[12915.42s -> 12916.30s]  Is this what I want to do now?
[12918.26s -> 12920.10s]  Okay, so Night on the Town is what I can do today.
[12920.10s -> 12921.78s]  But I'm just going to wait for New Year's Eve.
[12922.42s -> 12926.58s]  Because that is a night on the town, technically.
[12927.14s -> 12929.82s]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[12929.82s -> 12930.38s]  I'll wait for that.
[12931.34s -> 12932.30s]  New Year's Eve.
[12932.30s -> 12937.40s]  Oh, there's a talent showcase going down at the lounge.
[12937.40s -> 12938.92s]  Let's go embarrass ourselves.
[12938.92s -> 12945.26s]  Um, who is this?
[12955.38s -> 12956.42s]  I don't even know who this is.
[12970.78s -> 12972.14s]  They all got here at the same time.
[12973.18s -> 12973.82s]  This is loud.
[12973.82s -> 12974.94s]  I could turn it down.
[12974.94s -> 12980.46s]  It's really loud.
[12982.86s -> 12985.45s]  Okay, so it's a talent show.
[12985.61s -> 12986.57s]  Do I have any talents?
[12987.13s -> 12992.58s]  Well, this is a huge pool.
[12995.48s -> 12996.36s]  Skinny Dip?
[12997.00s -> 12997.64s]  Together?
[13000.06s -> 13000.54s]  With who?
[13001.18s -> 13002.78s]  Do I pick who goes skinny dipping?
[13004.47s -> 13005.51s]  Why does it say together?
[13017.38s -> 13019.62s]  Wait, wait, you're doing it too?
[13020.50s -> 13021.62s]  Okay, I didn't know.
[13021.62s -> 13023.06s]  I thought I was going to have to select people.
[13034.06s -> 13035.50s]  All right, that...
[13039.59s -> 13045.64s]  I didn't know what I thought I was going to select.
[13045.64s -> 13047.16s]  Okay, where's the mic?
[13047.16s -> 13052.12s]  Oh, it's right here.
[13052.12s -> 13053.08s]  Let's sing a duet.
[13053.08s -> 13055.72s]  Let's sing a country duet.
[13058.09s -> 13059.13s]  Me and Hillary.
[13059.13s -> 13068.79s]  No, I don't want to talk to that person.
[13068.79s -> 13069.67s]  I'm going to do a country duet.
[13070.86s -> 13072.30s]  We're going to drown each other out here.
[13077.02s -> 13078.06s]  Who gets all the screen time?
[13078.06s -> 13078.46s]  Let's see.
[13098.94s -> 13100.94s]  Come into the party, dog.
[13100.94s -> 13101.90s]  Get away from the entrance.
[13105.03s -> 13105.99s]  Oh, my.
[13105.99s -> 13106.87s]  We are...
[13106.87s -> 13108.36s]  We're like...
[13108.36s -> 13109.16s]  How high are we?
[13111.13s -> 13111.85s]  Holy mon...
[13113.08s -> 13114.20s]  Oh, okay.
[13116.52s -> 13117.24s]  That's high up.
[13118.12s -> 13119.40s]  I've played this before.
[13119.40s -> 13120.12s]  Yeah, I have.
[13121.96s -> 13124.07s]  I remember I had a wedding here.
[13126.23s -> 13128.79s]  And then people just started to attack each other.
[13128.79s -> 13129.51s]  From what I remember.
[13135.06s -> 13138.18s]  All right, we're going to go to Batuu.
[13142.15s -> 13143.19s]  That was fun.
[13143.19s -> 13143.69s]  Good night.
[13149.27s -> 13151.11s]  Am I going to selfie in the middle of your performance?
[13152.84s -> 13153.34s]  Yeah.
[13177.90s -> 13179.02s]  That just ruined her set.
[13183.10s -> 13184.38s]  Did people pay to see this?
[13190.70s -> 13212.63s]  Okay, it's time to go to Batuu.
[13214.39s -> 13215.11s]  I'm tired.
[13215.11s -> 13217.35s]  I need to go to work, but I'm not going to work tomorrow.
[13217.35s -> 13219.67s]  I'm going to Batuu tomorrow, and I'm going to become a Jedi.
[13219.75s -> 13225.00s]  My thing says I'm asleep.
[13226.52s -> 13227.02s]  What?
[13232.06s -> 13233.18s]  This guy is a weirdo.
[13242.09s -> 13243.61s]  Am I going to get a full night's sleep here?
[13264.55s -> 13265.59s]  All right, I got a night's sleep.
[13268.22s -> 13269.18s]  That was fun.
[13269.18s -> 13270.30s]  It's time to go to Batuu.
[13278.41s -> 13280.41s]  Wait, didn't I come with somebody?
[13282.06s -> 13283.10s]  I came here with someone.
[13283.10s -> 13284.06s]  Where's Hillary?
[13288.66s -> 13289.22s]  What's wrong?
[13289.22s -> 13291.08s]  What is it?
[13291.08s -> 13292.92s]  Oh, it's like a futuristic toilet or something.
[13298.15s -> 13298.87s]  Doesn't like it.
[13298.87s -> 13299.37s]  All right.
[13302.04s -> 13303.32s]  All right, it's time to go to Batuu.
[13306.86s -> 13307.90s]  Rest up.
[13307.90s -> 13308.94s]  Why did I even come here?
[13308.94s -> 13312.38s]  I told- I said that I wanted to rest up and get my energy levels higher.
[13313.18s -> 13314.54s]  And then I get a call from Hillary.
[13317.10s -> 13317.60s]  No.
[13318.54s -> 13319.42s]  He has worms.
[13332.15s -> 13335.80s]  I'm going to travel to Batuu and become a Jedi.
[13336.36s -> 13340.15s]  First, I'm going to pee.
[13340.87s -> 13343.27s]  And then I'm going to eat leftover pizza.
[13344.94s -> 13346.22s]  And then I'm going to wash my hands.
[13346.22s -> 13347.26s]  And then I'm going to brush my teeth.
[13348.39s -> 13349.03s]  Go.
[13349.03s -> 13364.01s]  Am I eating it out of the sink?
[13364.01s -> 13364.51s]  Okay.
[13364.97s -> 13366.14s]  Everything looks good.
[13366.86s -> 13368.31s]  Be the dog.
[13370.20s -> 13370.68s]  There you go.
[13374.54s -> 13375.98s]  All right, let's do it.
[13375.98s -> 13376.54s]  What time is it?
[13376.54s -> 13377.34s]  Oh, it's 1 a.m.
[13377.34s -> 13378.14s]  Never mind.
[13378.14s -> 13379.21s]  I'll just go to sleep.
[13379.21s -> 13380.41s]  But I'm not going to work tomorrow.
[13380.41s -> 13382.50s]  Go to bed.
[13382.50s -> 13383.22s]  Wake up.
[13383.22s -> 13385.26s]  None of the time was awful.
[13387.98s -> 13388.94s]  Maybe next year?
[13388.94s -> 13389.58s]  What do you mean?
[13389.58s -> 13392.41s]  Was it- is it New Year's Eve?
[13392.41s -> 13394.89s]  Did I leave the New Year's Eve party early?
[13394.89s -> 13397.05s]  I slept through the New Year's Eve party.
[13397.05s -> 13398.62s]  That's what that was?
[13401.85s -> 13402.89s]  Oh, it was.
[13404.06s -> 13404.94s]  Wait, was it?
[13405.50s -> 13413.03s]  I fell asleep on the couch at 10 o'clock.
[13413.03s -> 13415.45s]  Whatever.
[13415.45s -> 13416.81s]  I'm going to be a Jedi, so who cares?
[13417.53s -> 13419.58s]  No, today is New Year's Eve.
[13421.85s -> 13422.35s]  Okay.
[13423.26s -> 13423.82s]  Countdown.
[13423.82s -> 13426.78s]  Stay up past bedtime and shout at the TV in celebration.
[13426.78s -> 13430.47s]  Don't put off until tomorrow what you do today.
[13430.47s -> 13432.47s]  Click on your sims like, make resolution.
[13432.47s -> 13434.30s]  Okay.
[13435.58s -> 13438.22s]  Drink, dance, and play music.
[13438.22s -> 13439.10s]  Decorate.
[13439.10s -> 13440.90s]  All right, we'll get up.
[13440.90s -> 13442.42s]  I need to- I'm going to make a resolution.
[13442.42s -> 13450.47s]  Complete an aspiring milestone.
[13450.47s -> 13452.71s]  Get promoted, raise a skill, write a book.
[13452.71s -> 13457.98s]  Get a significant other.
[13457.98s -> 13459.99s]  What should I do?
[13459.99s -> 13460.87s]  Significant other?
[13460.87s -> 13463.11s]  Okay.
[13463.11s -> 13466.79s]  Let's go to Batuu.
[13472.01s -> 13476.46s]  I'll celebrate New Year's Eve when I get back.
[13476.46s -> 13476.94s]  Travel.
[13478.26s -> 13481.70s]  Should I take Santa to the Star Wars world?
[13481.70s -> 13488.63s]  I'm taking Santa.
[13488.63s -> 13488.95s]  Okay.
[13489.88s -> 13491.24s]  Where's Batuu?
[13491.24s -> 13503.56s]  Is it even up here?
[13503.56s -> 13505.08s]  Where's the Star Wars land?
[13505.08s -> 13506.28s]  It's vacation.
[13512.68s -> 13514.04s]  Take a vacation.
[13514.04s -> 13518.04s]  Okay.
[13525.24s -> 13526.44s]  All right, vacation.
[13527.00s -> 13533.75s]  Where's the Star Wars land?
[13533.75s -> 13544.54s]  Oh, it's right there.
[13549.58s -> 13551.24s]  It's time.
[13551.24s -> 13552.20s]  Okay, here we go.
[13552.20s -> 13553.96s]  Black Spire Outpost.
[13553.96s -> 13555.40s]  It's the central hub of Batuu.
[13555.40s -> 13557.32s]  Here you can find the dwelling.
[13557.32s -> 13558.68s]  Ogus Cantina.
[13558.68s -> 13560.36s]  Doc Ondar's Den of Antiques
[13560.36s -> 13561.88s]  and a number of food and drink options.
[13565.40s -> 13565.88s]  Here we go.
[13571.69s -> 13573.69s]  Everybody, get your bat chests ready.
[13576.15s -> 13577.03s]  Welcome to Batuu.
[13577.67s -> 13580.68s]  You use a different currency called Galactic Credits.
[13581.24s -> 13582.28s]  They have special inventory.
[13582.28s -> 13584.76s]  Don't worry, your simoleons and inventory are safe at home.
[13584.76s -> 13587.11s]  Check the career pin of your first mission.
[13589.24s -> 13591.88s]  Santa's dressed like a Jedi.
[13592.68s -> 13593.00s]  Okay.
[13593.88s -> 13595.08s]  Welcome to Batuu.
[13595.08s -> 13597.72s]  Plan your Batuu outfit at the dwelling.
[13598.36s -> 13601.94s]  Freshen up at the dwelling
[13601.94s -> 13603.94s]  and order food from Docking Bay 7.
[13609.03s -> 13609.83s]  Okay.
[13609.83s -> 13620.47s]  I'm going to order a drink.
[13621.75s -> 13622.71s]  I'm going to get a water.
[13623.51s -> 13629.30s]  I don't want to lose Santa.
[13629.94s -> 13632.17s]  It was just like Star Wars.
[13632.17s -> 13633.61s]  It's just like Star Wars world.
[13638.18s -> 13639.70s]  Special Star Wars water.
[13640.98s -> 13641.48s]  Yeah.
[13642.20s -> 13642.68s]  There's gold.
[13642.68s -> 13645.40s]  They put two drops of fucking green food coloring in it.
[13646.81s -> 13647.77s]  And it's $14.
[13648.89s -> 13656.72s]  I got to order a drink.
[13662.84s -> 13663.96s]  Oh, I already ordered a water.
[13664.76s -> 13667.05s]  Order food from Docking Bay 7.
[13667.05s -> 13668.01s]  Is this Docking Bay 7?
[13668.73s -> 13675.72s]  Ask about the resistance.
[13681.88s -> 13682.20s]  Yeah.
[13682.20s -> 13685.72s]  You know, if I had the mods with people getting hit by cars,
[13685.72s -> 13687.56s]  can you imagine just how would this even happen?
[13688.36s -> 13690.72s]  Okay.
[13690.72s -> 13691.36s]  Order food.
[13695.52s -> 13696.64s]  Outpost popcorn.
[13697.60s -> 13699.44s]  Rising Moon's Overnight Oats.
[13699.44s -> 13700.16s]  That's what I'm going to have.
[13703.10s -> 13704.38s]  Add that mod immediately.
[13705.34s -> 13707.74s]  Look, we're going to do normal for a little while,
[13707.74s -> 13711.34s]  and then I promise I will put on all the clown mods.
[13711.34s -> 13713.10s]  They'll all go on in the next day.
[13713.90s -> 13715.74s]  Just let me play the Sims normally.
[13716.46s -> 13719.84s]  It's been very abnormal so far, but you know,
[13719.84s -> 13721.20s]  we're doing clown mods.
[13721.20s -> 13721.76s]  I promise.
[13730.65s -> 13731.15s]  Okay.
[13732.01s -> 13732.73s]  I got my food.
[13733.69s -> 13734.41s]  I'll move.
[13743.53s -> 13745.53s]  It's time to start the music.
[13745.53s -> 13746.89s]  It's time to light the light.
[13747.61s -> 13750.41s]  It's time to make the music at the Muppet Show tonight.
[13751.61s -> 13752.33s]  It's time to...
[13752.33s -> 13752.89s]  Is it that way?
[13752.89s -> 13753.37s]  This isn't...
[13753.37s -> 13754.01s]  Wait, this is different.
[13754.01s -> 13754.89s]  This is not the Muppet song.
[13756.41s -> 13757.77s]  This is the Antenna song.
[13758.65s -> 13762.03s]  How come I didn't get the credit for that?
[13767.85s -> 13768.97s]  Stormtrooper?
[13768.97s -> 13785.00s]  How do I join the First Order?
[13785.00s -> 13785.64s]  I want to be a Sith.
[13793.53s -> 13796.72s]  What does it say?
[13797.60s -> 13799.12s]  If you are looking to join our ranks,
[13799.12s -> 13801.92s]  speak with Lieutenant Agnon in the First Order District.
[13802.56s -> 13806.57s]  You got it.
[13806.57s -> 13813.72s]  I'm going to freshen up.
[13813.72s -> 13815.16s]  All right, freshen up at the dwelling.
[13815.16s -> 13815.96s]  Where's my dwelling?
[13815.96s -> 13816.36s]  Over here?
[13816.92s -> 13821.50s]  How long am I on vacation for?
[13823.95s -> 13824.99s]  And where is Santa?
[13825.79s -> 13829.96s]  Okay, freshen up.
[13830.68s -> 13832.96s]  Okay, I gotta plan my outfit.
[13835.77s -> 13837.37s]  Plan Batuu outfit.
[13837.37s -> 13839.55s]  All right.
[13843.18s -> 13889.04s]  Where are our fucking pants?
[13898.22s -> 13899.18s]  I won't...
[13900.73s -> 13901.05s]  God.
[13904.88s -> 13905.28s]  That's fine.
[13905.28s -> 13906.08s]  I can stay like that.
[13909.84s -> 13912.64s]  I got bigger by coming to this Batuu world?
[13927.64s -> 13928.92s]  I want to be in a Stormtrooper outfit.
[13951.92s -> 13952.48s]  Whatever.
[13952.48s -> 13953.12s]  This is fine.
[13953.12s -> 13953.60s]  I don't care.
[13954.40s -> 13964.92s]  All right.
[13964.92s -> 13969.87s]  Now I need to order food from Docking Bay 7.
[13969.87s -> 13972.03s]  Which that's...
[13972.03s -> 13974.00s]  Order food from Docking Bay 7.
[13974.00s -> 13974.16s]  All right.
[13974.16s -> 13974.56s]  There it is.
[13979.48s -> 13980.20s]  I can't go in here?
[13986.65s -> 13990.99s]  Okay, I want a Braised Shack Roast.
[13991.87s -> 13992.19s]  Please.
[13993.15s -> 13996.51s]  I want a single serving of that.
[13998.65s -> 13999.61s]  Ask about the First Order.
[13999.61s -> 14000.57s]  Ask about the Resistance.
[14001.13s -> 14004.56s]  What if I have no money left?
[14004.56s -> 14012.99s]  This feels like one of those information games
[14012.99s -> 14014.99s]  about the movie that comes in the DVD.
[14016.51s -> 14017.71s]  You know, there's two DVDs.
[14019.64s -> 14022.44s]  And you go, oh, ask about the First Order.
[14022.44s -> 14024.94s]  I'm just going to give you little tidbits
[14024.94s -> 14029.84s]  about the story of the DVD that you just got.
[14029.84s -> 14036.80s]  This is a DVD game.
[14036.80s -> 14039.12s]  I wonder what happens if I ask about the First Order.
[14039.76s -> 14043.48s]  Come here.
[14043.48s -> 14048.75s]  I just want a lightsaber to put in my house.
[14053.63s -> 14054.35s]  Okay.
[14054.35s -> 14056.56s]  Is it every neighborhood on...
[14056.56s -> 14057.28s]  What the hell?
[14058.16s -> 14058.72s]  Don't leave.
[14059.96s -> 14061.08s]  You learned how to...
[14061.08s -> 14064.28s]  What do you mean I learned how to make Braised Shack Roast?
[14064.28s -> 14065.56s]  Isn't that a made-up animal?
[14066.12s -> 14067.72s]  That animal doesn't make...
[14067.72s -> 14069.08s]  That's not a real animal.
[14069.08s -> 14071.71s]  How would I have learned the recipe?
[14074.12s -> 14074.68s]  Is this a...
[14074.68s -> 14075.40s]  Hold on.
[14075.40s -> 14077.24s]  Is this a vacation spot in The Sims
[14077.24s -> 14078.92s]  like it's pretending to be Disney?
[14078.92s -> 14079.64s]  Or is this...
[14079.64s -> 14080.92s]  You're actually on Batuu.
[14081.72s -> 14084.68s]  Is it just a Disneyland?
[14084.68s -> 14085.48s]  This is not supposed to be...
[14105.95s -> 14107.15s]  Oh, where's Kylo Ren?
[14109.69s -> 14118.32s]  Where's Santa?
[14128.84s -> 14129.96s]  That's kind of what I was singing.
[14130.78s -> 14131.26s]  Come back here.
[14131.26s -> 14132.30s]  I need to talk to you more about
[14133.02s -> 14137.95s]  the rest of this DVD package ad part of DLC.
[14137.95s -> 14138.35s]  Come here.
[14140.16s -> 14142.48s]  Can you tell me some more about the world of Star Wars?
[14151.28s -> 14152.24s]  Ask about the First Order.
[14158.73s -> 14159.05s]  Okay.
[14159.05s -> 14161.37s]  I need to talk to Lieutenant Agnon in the First Order District.
[14164.01s -> 14165.05s]  Ask about the Resistance.
[14165.69s -> 14166.62s]  Three times.
[14172.24s -> 14173.52s]  I'm so annoying to this person.
[14174.48s -> 14175.60s]  Does this person work here?
[14175.60s -> 14176.08s]  Is that what it's...
[14176.08s -> 14176.64s]  What it's...
[14176.64s -> 14177.28s]  What it's implied?
[14189.87s -> 14191.37s]  Okay, scoundrels.
[14194.19s -> 14195.79s]  Vile scum are definitely on Batuu.
[14195.79s -> 14197.63s]  If you see anything suspicious, report to the First Order.
[14202.80s -> 14204.24s]  Can I tell you about my dreams?
[14209.15s -> 14211.31s]  I had a dream about a green alien.
[14211.31s -> 14212.03s]  It bit me.
[14212.03s -> 14213.07s]  It bit me in the face.
[14214.03s -> 14214.83s]  And I woke up.
[14214.83s -> 14215.55s]  I'm sweating.
[14223.13s -> 14224.33s]  No, scoundrels.
[14224.33s -> 14225.37s]  Okay, fun.
[14227.07s -> 14228.59s]  The festival of snow has started.
[14229.15s -> 14229.55s]  I don't care.
[14229.55s -> 14230.19s]  I'm on vacation.
[14231.36s -> 14233.12s]  Okay, I have to go to find this lieutenant.
[14233.76s -> 14236.36s]  Okay, cool.
[14236.36s -> 14237.48s]  I'm having fun on vacation.
[14240.44s -> 14241.32s]  Congratulations for completing your...
[14241.32s -> 14241.80s]  What did I say?
[14243.08s -> 14243.48s]  First mission.
[14243.48s -> 14244.84s]  Now that you have your bearings,
[14244.84s -> 14247.64s]  explore the other neighborhoods of Batuu by clicking travel in your phone.
[14247.88s -> 14248.44s]  Chinosa.
[14249.24s -> 14250.92s]  Build your reputation with three factions.
[14252.36s -> 14253.00s]  All right, let's go.
[14261.05s -> 14262.49s]  Let's go do the First Order.
[14262.49s -> 14263.29s]  Why are you so red?
[14263.29s -> 14263.85s]  I don't know.
[14263.85s -> 14265.53s]  I've been trying to figure that out for the last four hours.
[14268.17s -> 14269.29s]  All right, First Order District.
[14273.13s -> 14275.05s]  I see why people say this is the worst expansion.
[14282.51s -> 14283.47s]  How much is a lightsaber?
[14284.11s -> 14286.03s]  I just want to buy a lightsaber.
[14294.60s -> 14295.24s]  Okay, here we go.
[14297.15s -> 14298.11s]  Ask to see missions.
[14298.83s -> 14301.80s]  How much was this one?
[14301.80s -> 14302.68s]  I don't know.
[14302.68s -> 14305.32s]  I think it was like more than 15, 20 dollars.
[14306.04s -> 14311.29s]  Spread the word about our vision of the future for Black Spire Outpost.
[14311.29s -> 14313.93s]  Citizens must understand that everything we do is for their own good.
[14315.69s -> 14317.69s]  Okay, how do I do it?
[14320.32s -> 14322.40s]  Spread First Order propaganda.
[14327.92s -> 14328.40s]  To who?
[14329.74s -> 14330.70s]  This park is empty.
[14331.42s -> 14335.34s]  There's nobody here.
[14335.34s -> 14338.51s]  It's just me and the actors.
[14339.23s -> 14343.47s]  This is a really unpopular park.
[14344.11s -> 14350.46s]  Why is nobody here?
[14350.46s -> 14351.82s]  There's no other Sims here.
[14352.30s -> 14357.39s]  How do I spread propaganda?
[14358.03s -> 14364.56s]  Wait, do I have to do I take this back to the regular Sims world?
[14365.68s -> 14367.68s]  Should I give Santa propaganda?
[14376.22s -> 14380.68s]  How do I do that?
[14387.55s -> 14388.43s]  Discuss the force.
[14394.64s -> 14395.76s]  Why does he think they're actors?
[14397.76s -> 14398.96s]  Wait, are they not actors?
[14398.96s -> 14399.68s]  Is this an alien?
[14399.68s -> 14400.56s]  This is a real alien.
[14401.44s -> 14403.44s]  I don't understand where this sits.
[14404.24s -> 14411.07s]  Is this an actor?
[14419.87s -> 14420.83s]  But it's a vacation.
[14420.83s -> 14421.79s]  I'm I don't get it.
[14422.51s -> 14423.16s]  Where am I?
[14423.72s -> 14428.09s]  Stop chatting over here and get out of it.
[14428.09s -> 14428.57s]  Go over here.
[14428.57s -> 14430.65s]  You have to spread some First Order propaganda.
[14430.65s -> 14431.85s]  I want a red lightsaber.
[14432.41s -> 14434.62s]  I don't care how long it takes.
[14435.26s -> 14441.82s]  I will literally I will not go back to work until I get a red lightsaber.
[14442.54s -> 14452.17s]  Will you stop talking?
[14452.89s -> 14457.48s]  Okay, here we go.
[14461.80s -> 14464.44s]  Almost controlling his life will finally fulfill his dreams.
[14465.16s -> 14469.40s]  Oh, it's great that the First Order is here to help.
[14470.04s -> 14472.40s]  All right, I have to do this a few more times.
[14472.40s -> 14476.33s]  All right.
[14476.33s -> 14476.73s]  All right.
[14476.73s -> 14477.77s]  I am First Order.
[14477.77s -> 14478.33s]  I'm almost there.
[14479.05s -> 14480.46s]  Hey, you, come here.
[14488.89s -> 14490.65s]  This is great fucking game play.
[14495.45s -> 14499.53s]  I what I paid $20, whatever it was for this, and I'm going to do it.
[14499.53s -> 14500.89s]  And I'm going to get a lightsaber.
[14501.69s -> 14503.29s]  That's just what's happening tonight.
[14503.29s -> 14504.33s]  I'm sorry.
[14504.33s -> 14506.25s]  I'm getting I'm going to speed run a lightsaber.
[14506.81s -> 14513.88s]  I need to spread First Order propaganda.
[14518.54s -> 14519.58s]  It won't take very long.
[14519.58s -> 14520.06s]  Don't worry.
[14520.06s -> 14521.50s]  I'm going to be on vacation for like three days.
[14521.50s -> 14523.18s]  And I'm going to finally I'm going to get a lightsaber.
[14527.12s -> 14534.49s]  Scan the First Order supplies and get a blaster.
[14540.97s -> 14541.77s]  Where do I get that?
[14544.49s -> 14546.73s]  Where's your dog at dogs at the house?
[14546.73s -> 14548.01s]  But no, he's been taken care of.
[14548.01s -> 14548.97s]  I don't know where Santa is, though.
[14550.09s -> 14554.25s]  All right, I need to do four more propaganda.
[14554.89s -> 14560.65s]  Come on, let's go.
[14566.88s -> 14576.64s]  OK, that person hates me, but that's whatever in the gunk.
[14582.33s -> 14587.82s]  Take gunk droid propaganda propaganda.
[14588.46s -> 14593.37s]  OK, propaganda.
[14594.01s -> 14601.10s]  One more do.
[14601.10s -> 14605.00s]  Uh, can I make friends with what's your name?
[14605.80s -> 14608.36s]  Not to sit as a kind of friends and they invite you over to the house.
[14617.42s -> 14622.06s]  Oh, oh, it's seven.
[14622.78s -> 14624.62s]  It's seven thirty Pacific.
[14625.18s -> 14626.14s]  We all know what that means.
[14627.71s -> 14630.11s]  The Internet doesn't work for like 40 minutes.
[14632.49s -> 14635.96s]  Oh, we all know what that means.
[14645.39s -> 14645.63s]  All right.
[14645.63s -> 14646.19s]  Any propaganda?
[14651.53s -> 14652.25s]  Yeah, we just got up.
[14652.25s -> 14659.16s]  We got to ride out the storm here for about 40 minutes.
[14659.88s -> 14662.68s]  We're going to be dropping some frames.
[14662.68s -> 14664.20s]  This is how it is for some reason.
[14664.20s -> 14665.32s]  Randomly on random.
[14665.88s -> 14666.84s]  What is today?
[14666.84s -> 14668.35s]  What's today's date?
[14668.35s -> 14668.75s]  Tuesday?
[14677.82s -> 14678.46s]  All right, there it is.
[14679.02s -> 14681.63s]  Hey, it's all right.
[14681.63s -> 14683.23s]  Hey, you were going to skip this part of the stream anyways.
[14683.23s -> 14684.43s]  Well, I get my lightsaber.
[14684.43s -> 14684.91s]  It's all good.
[14685.55s -> 14689.48s]  Is that person all right?
[14695.60s -> 14696.72s]  Check your Sim's inventory.
[14706.04s -> 14707.48s]  Oh, I get a blaster.
[14711.64s -> 14712.52s]  Fake ID card.
[14713.08s -> 14717.71s]  I don't have a fake ID.
[14719.63s -> 14720.59s]  All right, I got it now.
[14722.14s -> 14725.18s]  Oh, my God, this is going to take way longer.
[14727.84s -> 14729.20s]  I thought that was going to be a full cube.
[14730.20s -> 14730.76s]  It's all right.
[14731.56s -> 14732.68s]  Well, the Internet sucks.
[14732.68s -> 14733.16s]  Don't worry.
[14734.12s -> 14734.60s]  We'll take it.
[14735.68s -> 14736.32s]  I can cheat.
[14736.96s -> 14746.64s]  I can.
[14746.64s -> 14747.12s]  Oh, that's right.
[14747.12s -> 14747.68s]  I can cheat.
[14751.12s -> 14757.63s]  Oh, Marian alien.
[14757.63s -> 14759.79s]  Let me become friends with an alien
[14759.79s -> 14761.39s]  because I'm very curious if these people,
[14761.39s -> 14766.00s]  they exist in the kind of real world,
[14766.00s -> 14767.52s]  like Earth or I don't know where we are.
[14770.64s -> 14772.08s]  Can I make friends with this person?
[14787.55s -> 14790.19s]  OK, so I'm getting a relationship status.
[14790.43s -> 14791.55s]  Easy, Yama Sprada.
[14793.42s -> 14795.90s]  Wait, I, I, I know them now.
[14798.12s -> 14800.20s]  OK, so can I invite them to parties and stuff?
[14811.66s -> 14813.18s]  Are you recording this from McDonald's?
[14813.98s -> 14815.66s]  No, it's just randomly at some.
[14815.66s -> 14818.38s]  I, dude, I wish I could tell you how this is even possible.
[14819.26s -> 14823.08s]  So this is the most ridiculous, bizarre thing.
[14824.11s -> 14825.15s]  So do you age here?
[14825.15s -> 14827.16s]  I don't know.
[14827.16s -> 14829.40s]  So from seven thirty to like seven,
[14829.40s -> 14831.56s]  like fifty or seven thirty to like eight.
[14832.44s -> 14834.60s]  My Internet goes to fucking like one percent speeds.
[14837.21s -> 14839.29s]  And then it goes back to a thousand, a thousand
[14839.29s -> 14840.49s]  for the rest of the day, all day.
[14841.53s -> 14842.65s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[14842.65s -> 14843.45s]  It makes no sense.
[14845.90s -> 14848.78s]  It goes from a thousand, a thousand at like seven twenty nine
[14849.42s -> 14852.30s]  to one megabit per second at seven thirty.
[14852.30s -> 14852.80s]  Exactly.
[14853.74s -> 14857.18s]  And then at like eight twenty PM
[14857.18s -> 14858.46s]  goes right back to a thousand thousand.
[14861.63s -> 14862.43s]  It doesn't make any sense.
[14864.83s -> 14867.77s]  All right, I need to go to the bathroom.
[14867.77s -> 14868.65s]  But this is why.
[14868.65s -> 14870.49s]  So another reason why I wanted to start my streams.
[14876.54s -> 14879.84s]  What was that alarm?
[14879.84s -> 14880.64s]  All right, I need to use the bathroom.
[14880.64s -> 14881.44s]  Where's the bathroom?
[14882.00s -> 14890.72s]  Where is the bathroom?
[14892.16s -> 14893.05s]  Oh, it's right here.
[14902.46s -> 14902.70s]  All right.
[14902.70s -> 14908.22s]  So how do I how do I cheat to get myself like plus five first order points?
[14908.94s -> 14920.59s]  Does anybody have the code?
[14920.59s -> 14929.90s]  I'll show I'll show that tomorrow.
[14929.90s -> 14931.04s]  I'll show that tomorrow.
[14932.54s -> 14933.98s]  New new viewers.
[14934.62s -> 14937.34s]  I have probably never seen that picture and I'll show it tomorrow.
[14944.48s -> 14944.64s]  All right.
[14944.64s -> 14945.36s]  So what's the cheat?
[14949.76s -> 14950.56s]  Yeah, I'll be left tomorrow.
[14956.75s -> 14958.35s]  And tomorrow I'll put mods on tomorrow.
[14959.07s -> 14960.27s]  But I'm going to make them.
[14960.27s -> 14962.19s]  We're going to do them slowly.
[14963.15s -> 14964.19s]  It's not just going to be.
[14964.99s -> 14967.47s]  Everyone gets hit by a car and everybody gets hurt.
[14967.47s -> 14968.27s]  It's going to be slow.
[14968.83s -> 14971.79s]  It's going to be going to just very slowly get into it.
[14982.96s -> 14983.84s]  Okay, what is it?
[14983.84s -> 14989.28s]  Okay, it's control shift C enter testing cheats true.
[14989.92s -> 14996.84s]  And then shift click your Sim and do give all items testing cheats true.
[14996.84s -> 14998.44s]  And then shift click and give all items.
[14998.44s -> 14999.80s]  I mean, I got to read this again.
[15005.93s -> 15012.70s]  Shift C testing cheats true.
[15013.50s -> 15015.53s]  Shift click your Sim.
[15015.53s -> 15016.33s]  Batu cheats.
[15016.89s -> 15025.05s]  Okay, this expansion sucks.
[15027.40s -> 15028.20s]  But that's not fair.
[15028.20s -> 15029.08s]  It's it's cool.
[15029.08s -> 15030.92s]  If you're a big Star Wars fan, I'm a big star.
[15030.92s -> 15032.04s]  I would probably like this.
[15032.76s -> 15034.16s]  At least I don't know.
[15034.16s -> 15038.92s]  Like what I you just walk around and like talk to people and just grind out.
[15039.72s -> 15041.48s]  I mean, it's kind of it's all right.
[15041.48s -> 15042.04s]  It's all right.
[15042.04s -> 15042.28s]  All right.
[15042.28s -> 15055.23s]  So now what do I do?
[15064.65s -> 15065.21s]  It's spring.
[15067.71s -> 15079.05s]  Pack cheats, expansion packs, name packs, batu cheats, batu reputation.
[15079.69s -> 15087.39s]  First order, add set level to rank five.
[15092.94s -> 15097.12s]  Okay, and batu cheats.
[15098.19s -> 15099.31s]  Give batu items.
[15105.15s -> 15106.75s]  Dude, I didn't want literally the end.
[15106.75s -> 15108.27s]  I didn't want every single item.
[15108.83s -> 15116.12s]  How do I take this out?
[15119.79s -> 15131.28s]  How do I use my lightsaber lightsaber?
[15131.28s -> 15132.96s]  You're lightsaber hilt collection.
[15132.96s -> 15134.40s]  Don't use a lightsaber.
[15135.04s -> 15139.47s]  What do you mean you don't use a lightsaber?
[15140.03s -> 15144.33s]  I need a crystal.
[15144.33s -> 15145.05s]  You have to make it.
[15145.61s -> 15147.96s]  Where do I go to do that?
[15150.76s -> 15151.72s]  You have to drag it out.
[15164.24s -> 15165.76s]  You need to build the lightsaber.
[15168.24s -> 15169.60s]  Control shift, click your Sim.
[15169.60s -> 15170.08s]  Woohoo.
[15170.08s -> 15170.72s]  Jabba the Hut.
[15173.95s -> 15174.83s]  It's furniture.
[15177.45s -> 15179.61s]  It's it's just a piece of furniture.
[15182.14s -> 15182.46s]  Okay.
[15183.44s -> 15184.88s]  All right, Santa, let's get out of here.
[15185.76s -> 15186.96s]  It's time to go home, Santa.
[15191.53s -> 15192.33s]  It's time to go.
[15192.33s -> 15192.81s]  Let's leave.
[15193.21s -> 15194.09s]  It's time to leave.
[15194.09s -> 15194.97s]  I thought it was going to be like a
[15197.37s -> 15199.13s]  I thought it was going to be like swinging around.
[15210.65s -> 15211.85s]  I can't leave.
[15211.85s -> 15216.52s]  Check Santa's ID.
[15238.49s -> 15239.61s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[15239.61s -> 15241.29s]  Hey, wait, wait, what are you doing?
[15242.01s -> 15242.33s]  Why?
[15243.77s -> 15244.41s]  What's happening?
[15245.37s -> 15247.37s]  I wanted to show my I want to put my crystal in.
[15249.63s -> 15250.19s]  What did he do?
[15250.19s -> 15250.99s]  Why did he do that?
[15252.03s -> 15252.67s]  Am I okay?
[15253.55s -> 15254.19s]  What happened?
[15254.83s -> 15264.48s]  I got knocked.
[15264.48s -> 15265.68s]  Santa knocked me out.
[15278.12s -> 15279.24s]  No, keep that out.
[15279.24s -> 15280.20s]  Don't put that on.
[15280.20s -> 15280.76s]  Keep it out.
[15296.00s -> 15297.28s]  Train with lightsaber.
[15309.07s -> 15310.51s]  Who fbs Andy?
[15310.51s -> 15310.99s]  Fuck.
[15310.99s -> 15311.71s]  I know.
[15311.71s -> 15312.03s]  Shit.
[15313.07s -> 15313.79s]  God damn it.
[15313.79s -> 15316.19s]  I got to the my favorite part of the entire day.
[15320.36s -> 15320.84s]  All right.
[15320.84s -> 15321.16s]  Shit.
[15321.16s -> 15321.64s]  You know what?
[15321.64s -> 15324.04s]  I think I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to throw an audible out here.
[15324.84s -> 15326.20s]  Yeah, I think I'm all right.
[15326.20s -> 15327.08s]  Here's what I think is going to happen.
[15328.62s -> 15328.86s]  All right.
[15328.86s -> 15329.50s]  Here's what's happening.
[15330.32s -> 15331.60s]  We're going to call it right now.
[15331.60s -> 15333.84s]  I'm going to be back tomorrow early, like in the morning.
[15333.84s -> 15334.64s]  I'm going to go all day.
[15338.00s -> 15338.88s]  I think that's the plan.
[15339.80s -> 15340.52s]  I think that's the plan.
[15340.52s -> 15341.72s]  The plan is I got to start early.
[15341.72s -> 15342.92s]  I'm not starting at three o'clock tomorrow.
[15342.92s -> 15344.68s]  I'm starting at like noon tomorrow.
[15346.09s -> 15347.37s]  And I'm going to we're going to play this all day.
[15347.37s -> 15350.76s]  I'm going to put mods on it and we'll take it from there.
[15350.76s -> 15351.72s]  I got to start early.
[15351.72s -> 15353.74s]  I got to start earlier.
[15353.74s -> 15357.10s]  We got to avoid the we got to avoid the seven thirty p.m.
[15358.22s -> 15359.26s]  Internet meltdown.
[15362.81s -> 15365.93s]  So if I start at noon tomorrow between twelve and one,
[15365.93s -> 15368.89s]  then we can stream for six or seven hours and completely avoid it.
[15370.08s -> 15370.80s]  I think that's the play.
[15373.15s -> 15374.59s]  And hold me to this.
[15374.59s -> 15375.63s]  Hold me to this.
[15375.63s -> 15378.40s]  I want you to seriously hold me to this because
[15378.40s -> 15380.48s]  I can't start at three o'clock in the afternoon Pacific.
[15380.48s -> 15381.60s]  I can't I can't.
[15383.76s -> 15385.36s]  The streams have to be earlier.
[15385.36s -> 15388.08s]  The streams have to be earlier.
[15388.08s -> 15392.27s]  There's no way you're starting at noon.
[15392.27s -> 15394.19s]  I have to, though, because like this,
[15394.19s -> 15397.23s]  we hit the seven thirty p.m. hard turnoff.
[15400.67s -> 15402.03s]  And I also called my ISP.
[15403.23s -> 15404.54s]  Where am I?
[15405.10s -> 15409.61s]  All right.
[15409.61s -> 15410.41s]  Let me save this.
[15410.41s -> 15411.21s]  I got to save this.
[15411.21s -> 15412.17s]  We're saving it.
[15412.17s -> 15414.97s]  We're going to start fresh and early tomorrow.
[15414.97s -> 15417.13s]  Come to the flea market with me.
[15417.13s -> 15419.13s]  I don't I don't have time to do this right now.
[15419.13s -> 15422.00s]  We're going to start fresh tomorrow early.
[15422.00s -> 15424.25s]  Starting at noon.
[15424.25s -> 15429.69s]  And we're going until we're going until the Internet turns us off.
[15429.69s -> 15437.08s]  I'm glad we got to go at least for four and a half hours.
[15437.08s -> 15437.96s]  That's fun.
[15437.96s -> 15447.87s]  I'll be back tomorrow.
[15447.87s -> 15452.22s]  And for those of you that have been watching for a long time,
[15452.22s -> 15456.83s]  I mean, you know, it's kind of frame ratey.
[15456.83s -> 15458.19s]  Yeah, well, I'll be live tomorrow.
[15458.19s -> 15458.59s]  Don't worry.
[15458.59s -> 15461.13s]  We'll go for about six or seven hours.
[15461.13s -> 15462.49s]  There are a lot of people here today, too.
[15462.49s -> 15465.93s]  I just if you were if you stuck around from the Among Us thing,
[15465.93s -> 15469.10s]  that's where a lot of people came from, then cool.
[15469.10s -> 15471.26s]  I hope you enjoy the stream.
[15471.26s -> 15472.46s]  I had a really fun time.
[15472.46s -> 15474.54s]  The first four hours of the stream were really funny.
[15474.54s -> 15476.35s]  Had a lot of fun.
[15476.35s -> 15480.94s]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[15480.94s -> 15482.96s]  But what's this?
[15483.60s -> 15484.16s]  Those of you.
[15484.16s -> 15489.31s]  Hey, how many old viewers from like 2016, 2017?
[15489.31s -> 15490.11s]  Are you ready?
[15490.11s -> 15512.32s]  You ready for this?
[15512.32s -> 15512.96s]  It's back.
[15522.24s -> 15523.76s]  And the music's back, too.
[15523.76s -> 15529.04s]  Give you a little bit of channel nostalgia, right?
[15529.04s -> 15530.00s]  Before we go.
[15530.00s -> 15537.85s]  You know, it's really funny about this.
[15538.41s -> 15541.34s]  This is what's supposed to be every single end of the stream.
[15542.36s -> 15546.44s]  And I just didn't put the file in OBS.
[15546.44s -> 15547.80s]  I just had to drag it over here.
[15548.36s -> 15550.76s]  And it was just in a folder.
[15550.76s -> 15551.88s]  I just didn't do it.
[15551.88s -> 15556.78s]  But thanks for watching, everybody.
[15557.34s -> 15560.81s]  I would have liked to have gone for like another hour or so,
[15560.81s -> 15561.77s]  at least five hours or so.
[15561.77s -> 15565.05s]  But, you know, I got I got to beat the Internet.
[15565.05s -> 15570.12s]  So all streams, if I want to have five to six hour streams,
[15570.12s -> 15586.96s]  all streams until further notice have to start at between 12 and 1 Pacific.
[15586.96s -> 15589.02s]  So that's the plan.
[15593.10s -> 15594.22s]  Such a weird problem.
[15594.22s -> 15597.66s]  Because sometimes we'll be live at 7, 8 p.m.
[15598.22s -> 15599.50s]  without a single problem.
[15599.50s -> 15601.74s]  It's so weird because in like an hour or so,
[15602.81s -> 15605.45s]  I'll do a speed test and it'll just be a thousand, a thousand.
[15606.09s -> 15607.05s]  It's just so random.
[15607.77s -> 15609.44s]  You're moving the goalposts already.
[15609.44s -> 15609.92s]  No, no, no, no.
[15610.56s -> 15615.28s]  Between 12 and 1230 Pacific tomorrow is what I'm going to turn the stream on.
[15615.28s -> 15618.22s]  I actually felt pretty good today.
[15618.22s -> 15621.02s]  So I felt I'm glad that I was because I'll be honest,
[15621.02s -> 15623.10s]  during the among us stream, I might never really want to do that.
[15624.28s -> 15627.80s]  That was super important because that was a really fun kind of idea
[15627.80s -> 15629.00s]  just to do that one day.
[15630.11s -> 15632.91s]  But after that stream, that was middle of covid.
[15632.91s -> 15635.71s]  I was like, I, I got to go lie down.
[15636.27s -> 15641.92s]  See you at three.
[15643.04s -> 15644.24s]  No, I can't.
[15644.24s -> 15647.98s]  I can't start at three because that means that I'm giving myself a limit of
[15649.44s -> 15652.24s]  a large percent chance that it's going to be a four hour stream.
[15652.24s -> 15656.99s]  I got to pull it back to at least one because then it's guaranteed to be
[15656.99s -> 15660.19s]  at least a five to six hour stream before we hit that kind of period
[15660.19s -> 15661.87s]  at about seven o'clock, seven thirty.
[15661.87s -> 15670.00s]  But thanks for watching.
[15670.56s -> 15671.12s]  See you tomorrow.
[15672.78s -> 15673.58s]  Have a great night.
[15674.14s -> 15674.94s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[15674.94s -> 15675.50s]  See you soon.
[15677.40s -> 15678.60s]  More Sims 4 tomorrow.
[15678.60s -> 15681.40s]  I'll probably add a few mods, but I don't want to go crazy with it.
[15681.96s -> 15683.96s]  And I hold me to that.
[15684.60s -> 15685.40s]  No more cheating.
[15686.04s -> 15687.00s]  I wanted the lightsaber.
[15687.00s -> 15688.12s]  I know, but no more cheating.
[15689.18s -> 15691.02s]  Only slightly funny mods.
[15691.74s -> 15693.26s]  And I'm going to go on a snow trip tomorrow.
[15693.26s -> 15694.22s]  I want to go on a ski trip.
[15694.78s -> 15699.07s]  I'll see you later.
[15699.07s -> 15766.96s]  Have a good night, guys.
