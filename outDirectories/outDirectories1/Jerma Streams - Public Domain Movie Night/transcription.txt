[1.53s -> 10.54s]  He's not here. Yeah, I am here. I'm gonna one minute can go by before I come and say hello
[11.48s -> 21.75s]  Hello quick show ads. No, i'm not gonna i'm not gonna show ads during this
[23.59s -> 28.71s]  You don't see ads in the movie theater, but you see ads for other movies before the movie starts
[30.06s -> 34.01s]  No, i'm not. I don't think I can even do that
[34.57s -> 37.85s]  Plus I would just play gemini man trailer five times
[42.38s -> 48.84s]  Just pretend I did that
[48.84s -> 50.81s]  That'll be
[50.81s -> 54.39s]  Forever
[54.39s -> 57.35s]  Hey, that was a plus two. That was a that was a thought plus two
[57.99s -> 59.99s]  I didn't do it, but I was thinking about it
[65.91s -> 68.23s]  Yeah, i've already had a drink. Is there a problem with that?
[69.18s -> 70.54s]  I'm 21
[70.54s -> 80.36s]  Oh, you don't think i'm gonna have a couple glasses of cocktail
[81.85s -> 86.25s]  To watch we're gonna watch public domain. We're gonna watch the gorilla from 1939 guys
[86.89s -> 96.49s]  Like i'm i'm gonna have i'm gonna have a drink because that's what i'm gonna do
[97.13s -> 103.72s]  He's not you know, why are you not sober to appreciate the art?
[104.44s -> 110.49s]  So we have three movies
[110.57s -> 112.55s]  That are lined up here
[112.55s -> 113.67s]  because
[113.67s -> 115.67s]  something that I realized by
[115.75s -> 117.75s]  starting to put this stuff together is
[119.38s -> 123.86s]  The the trend of movies being more than two fucking hours long
[124.74s -> 126.79s]  Happened recently
[126.79s -> 129.03s]  Movies used to be an hour long
[129.59s -> 136.68s]  They used to be one to one point over that all these movies are like an hour long one point hour and 20 hour
[136.68s -> 137.88s]  And ten hour and ten
[137.88s -> 140.39s]  I was like, holy shit
[140.39s -> 145.19s]  I'm not gonna be able to watch more than like one or two of these all movies are like an hour and 45 minutes
[145.91s -> 147.59s]  No, they're not that's just like
[147.59s -> 149.35s]  It's like the last five years
[149.35s -> 155.30s]  What about the lord of the rings? That's that's where it started
[155.86s -> 163.16s]  Thanks a lot peter jackson more like the last 40 right
[164.52s -> 168.02s]  recently
[168.02s -> 173.85s]  Well the last like 20 no even movies in the 80s weren't more than an hour and 20 hour and 30
[174.73s -> 176.73s]  Movies in the night of some movies in the 90s
[177.29s -> 180.86s]  What about gone with the wind?
[180.86s -> 184.15s]  How long was gone how gone with the wind?
[185.32s -> 188.30s]  runtime
[188.30s -> 193.54s]  This is four hours
[193.54s -> 198.02s]  Oh, wait a minute. How long is the intermission in gone of gone with the wind?
[198.50s -> 200.50s]  It was a hundred and fifteen minutes
[203.02s -> 208.46s]  So yeah, there was there's a there's an there's a more than one full movie length in the middle
[211.40s -> 214.47s]  What about the ten commandments?
[214.55s -> 217.34s]  ten commandments
[217.34s -> 220.06s]  runtime
[220.06s -> 224.15s]  Three hours and 40 minutes
[224.87s -> 229.43s]  All right, one of the searches for the ten commandments runtime people also ask
[230.15s -> 234.79s]  Is anyone still alive from the ten commandments and if you think about that like that's
[235.59s -> 238.55s]  No, probably no that was like thousands of years ago
[239.43s -> 240.95s]  I don't think so
[240.95s -> 243.72s]  Is anybody even still alive from when they did that?
[246.15s -> 249.03s]  Everyone moses did that is he still alive?
[253.05s -> 254.49s]  Imagine being
[254.49s -> 256.25s]  Imagine the internet existed
[256.25s -> 260.97s]  during that whole during that time period imagine going back and looking at old pictures of moses instead of like
[262.26s -> 264.26s]  Fucking abbot and costello
[264.50s -> 267.26s]  Oh, wow. This is like an old an old moses picture
[271.08s -> 272.28s]  cool
[272.28s -> 278.78s]  Well old school cool. It's like moses with a surfboard. What the fuck? I can't even comprehend this. That's like my grandmother
[279.48s -> 294.79s]  We live in a weird time. Don't we redditor? I know i'm a i'm a front page redditor. We already went over this
[294.79s -> 298.63s]  I'm not a real redditor. I'm a i'm a redditor that only goes to the first part
[300.82s -> 303.06s]  But welcome here's the what's on tap tonight
[304.09s -> 310.09s]  We're going to do the gorilla which is an hour long and then we're going to do plan nine from outer space
[310.57s -> 312.57s]  Which is an hour and 18 minutes
[312.89s -> 315.18s]  And then we're going to top it off
[315.18s -> 321.48s]  With santa claus conquers the martians which is also about an hour and 18
[326.55s -> 328.55s]  So we're going to make a couple of rules here
[329.27s -> 331.90s]  For how these are going to be watched
[331.98s -> 333.98s]  um
[333.98s -> 337.05s]  Do I get?
[337.05s -> 339.67s]  at least two
[339.67s -> 345.99s]  30 second skip vetoes
[345.99s -> 350.86s]  Like I get to skip 30 seconds
[351.02s -> 354.55s]  No, why?
[354.55s -> 359.67s]  Um, I don't know if I know I I I can skip like 20 seconds if I need to
[360.82s -> 363.13s]  We want to suffer
[363.13s -> 367.21s]  So these movies weren't gonna be good santa claus conquers the martians is probably gonna be like a good movie
[367.29s -> 369.29s]  Okay, I got it's probably gonna be a good movie
[369.53s -> 372.74s]  That's why i'm saving it for last
[372.74s -> 380.55s]  What's 30 seconds going to accomplish?
[380.71s -> 382.15s]  um, I don't know
[382.15s -> 386.95s]  Skipping, uh nudity that could be in one of these movies. I don't know the second. I see clothes come off
[386.95s -> 389.83s]  I'm skipping 30 seconds. That's just the way i'm sorry. That's gonna happen
[393.11s -> 395.11s]  That's my that's what i'm talking about here
[397.96s -> 399.96s]  Santa's gonna be nude. I don't know
[403.18s -> 404.78s]  Are you guys ready?
[404.78s -> 407.48s]  Are you ready for the first one? We've got the gorilla
[408.28s -> 410.60s]  And this is by this is a horror
[411.24s -> 413.40s]  Comedy movie by the ritz brothers
[414.12s -> 416.12s]  You don't know who the ritz brothers are
[416.28s -> 422.60s]  They're the three stooges, but they're not the three stooges. They're just three guys that like let's get out of here
[423.80s -> 425.80s]  And they hit each other in the head with stuff
[425.80s -> 427.80s]  Uh, it was pretty popular at the time
[429.93s -> 435.61s]  Like the the three guys hit each other in the head with hammers and punch each other in the nose and pinch each other's ears
[436.41s -> 437.53s]  was
[437.53s -> 439.29s]  the fortnight youtuber
[439.29s -> 446.49s]  You know what I mean? There's a lot of them. It was a lot of them like back in like the the 30s
[446.73s -> 450.33s]  This was like the youtuber. This was like the influencer. They just like the fortnight guy
[452.68s -> 464.74s]  So you're like wait, well, how come there's so many three stooges copies you tell me not this again
[468.86s -> 472.70s]  That's a plus two hot take no, it's not that's just what do you want to say?
[472.70s -> 475.18s]  It's like the most popular game and everybody plays it
[476.07s -> 479.99s]  I don't play it though because i'm fucking I do stuff. I do stuff. I do different. I do stuff different
[480.71s -> 482.87s]  I don't play fortnight because I just I do things different
[483.43s -> 486.31s]  Right, uh 50 dollars just came in
[488.71s -> 490.55s]  from brooding
[490.55s -> 492.31s]  high rope tarot
[492.31s -> 494.62s]  It's 5 000 bits. Thank you
[494.62s -> 497.69s]  Hi, jerma. I'm sorry. My last donation was worded so badly
[497.69s -> 502.81s]  I didn't mean for it to sound like that. The dream was that you were streaming but also chat could talk on stream
[503.45s -> 508.17s]  And kim was making fun of me for being louder than you and that people couldn't hear you
[510.41s -> 514.89s]  Anyways, thanks for being such a funny guy. I've been going through a shitty time recently and having a laugh helps
[514.89s -> 517.93s]  Can we watch the jimmy neutron movie? That would be illegal
[519.21s -> 524.89s]  Jimmy neutron is currently owned by believe viacom and they keep coming out with stuff and it's not in public domain
[524.89s -> 529.42s]  I would get a lot of trouble. I would get sued. We're going with non-sued movies
[529.98s -> 532.98s]  Not in public domain. It's unfortunate
[534.46s -> 540.78s]  Maybe in 75 years when it goes into public domain, we'll we'll watch it. But yeah, I don't know my like grandson like german
[542.02s -> 546.46s]  German jr. German jr. Nine eight five when he's streaming in a hundred years
[547.30s -> 555.91s]  Uh, you guys can watch that together. It'll be in public domain by then but thanks for the 50 dollars a lot of money
[556.31s -> 562.09s]  And with that, uh, why don't we get started? I'm ready. How can you be ready? But I am
[563.06s -> 565.06s]  um, so I
[565.14s -> 569.46s]  I
[569.46s -> 573.82s]  So I can't skip at all at all
[578.26s -> 579.45s]  Okay

[657.11s -> 658.79s]  Show your face
[658.79s -> 663.19s]  No, when you watch a movie the guy's face isn't down in the corner. That's not how this works
[667.29s -> 669.29s]  I'm not part of the movie
[669.37s -> 680.42s]  Hey ten community subs. Thanks snake cowboy for the tens up. All right charge. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet
[680.50s -> 686.18s]  We got to invert. Oh, hey, you know, don't skip immerse us in the movie, but please put a face cam 40 percent of the screen
[687.42s -> 688.94s]  You're a maniac
[688.94s -> 690.94s]  Murderer terrorizes suburb
[693.86s -> 696.44s]  There he is
[696.44s -> 700.92s]  Is that supposed to be a real is a real gorilla at least baffled as the gorilla strikes again
[702.78s -> 707.42s]  Maniac murderer claims another victim. Is it just the zoo? Did he get out of the zoo?
[708.22s -> 722.15s]  Let's just turn stricken as murderer makes good his threat. How hard is it to catch a gorilla?
[722.55s -> 752.17s]  Why is he like reaching behind a desk to try to find dropped keys?
[752.73s -> 755.42s]  Parting is such sweet sorrow
[755.90s -> 758.94s]  That I shall say good night till it be morrow

[763.94s -> 765.67s]  Good night
[765.67s -> 767.67s]  Parting is such sweet sorrow
[768.33s -> 770.33s]  That I should say good night
[770.65s -> 773.61s]  Till it be morrow. Why are you praying to romeo and juliet?
[774.01s -> 781.82s]  Just put a note on her

[808.89s -> 822.90s]  Pick up a weapon, why don't you take the note off and just see what it says
[831.24s -> 833.24s]  Wait, this is well kiddy
[834.07s -> 836.07s]  What is all this racket about?
[836.31s -> 838.31s]  Oh

[845.51s -> 849.75s]  You have been dreaming. Oh, no, what's that? I don't know. I'm telling you. I don't know anything

[915.77s -> 921.42s]  Oh nonsense. Now you go back to bed and don't why is the amazon prime? I don't understand. Oh, don't go back to bed

[1045.96s -> 1058.57s]  Rain was so hard to do back in like the 40s

[1069.43s -> 1071.50s]  I'm norma denby
[1071.50s -> 1073.50s]  Welcome to our fuckface
[1076.25s -> 1078.25s]  Stevens is expecting you miss denby
[1080.20s -> 1082.60s]  May I take your coat? Oh, no. Thank you. I'll keep it on
[1084.28s -> 1089.13s]  Who is this person by the way place your uncle has here he likes it
[1089.93s -> 1092.33s]  You have to live in it this way, please
[1098.38s -> 1101.74s]  Huge cabinet doors. I love them. Well, well, well if it isn't the prodigal niece
[1103.58s -> 1110.58s]  I'll see you again darling. Is that her stepping down dear? She weighed like five metric tons. Good. I'm glad you did
[1110.98s -> 1112.58s]  This is jack uncle walter
[1112.58s -> 1116.26s]  This niece of mine isn't much of a correspondent what few letters she did write though were full of you
[1116.74s -> 1121.46s]  Congratulations young man. Thank you. And I hope you'll excuse me for barging in like this nonsense. I'm delighted
[1121.94s -> 1124.74s]  I was more than personally surprised to hear that you set your marriage for dune
[1125.46s -> 1131.06s]  Do you realize it's only a month away? Well, we decided we didn't want to rush things too much. So oh we put it off until
[1131.30s -> 1133.30s]  the day after tomorrow
[1134.02s -> 1136.02s]  The day after tomorrow
[1136.66s -> 1137.70s]  Soon
[1137.70s -> 1138.82s]  Hi
[1138.82s -> 1140.82s]  I know no, that's fine
[1141.06s -> 1143.06s]  That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about
[1143.86s -> 1146.58s]  But i'm forgetting my role as host sit down my dear sit down
[1149.11s -> 1151.35s]  We may as well come to the point
[1151.35s -> 1156.87s]  I can't get this suit on to talk to norma alone. Mr. Stevenson. Oh, no. No, it's airtight. Help me as norma's future husband
[1157.51s -> 1159.51s]  What I have to say concerns you too
[1159.91s -> 1161.91s]  now as norma knows
[1161.99s -> 1165.03s]  She and I were named joint heirs under the terms of her father's will
[1165.99s -> 1169.03s]  And until she marries i'm the executive of her estate
[1169.51s -> 1174.31s]  But should anything happen to either of us by then the survivor inherited the entire estate
[1174.95s -> 1179.75s]  And I think that you norma and you jack as her future husband should know of what that estate consists
[1180.31s -> 1181.51s]  to that end
[1181.51s -> 1183.51s]  I prepared a record of the estate's holdings
[1184.23s -> 1186.23s]  And I want to talk it over with you both after dinner
[1186.55s -> 1191.19s]  But your radiogram said there was something urgent the fire feels so good. Yeah, I wouldn't want to be that close
[1191.27s -> 1193.11s]  Urgent I
[1193.11s -> 1194.79s]  I wouldn't have sent it
[1194.79s -> 1199.19s]  Something's worrying you what is it? Uncle walder? Well, perhaps i'm unduly alarmed but
[1200.31s -> 1203.27s]  Last night I received the black and white boomer face
[1204.87s -> 1206.31s]  From the gorilla
[1206.31s -> 1212.09s]  The gorilla you mean that murderer the one the papers have been so full of I do
[1213.05s -> 1217.45s]  What the fuck but isn't it possible that this is all just a joke that someone's playing a prank on you?
[1217.85s -> 1219.45s]  I wish I could think so
[1219.45s -> 1224.33s]  But uncle walder why should he just tell him that you owe a quarter of a million dollars to the fucking irs
[1224.49s -> 1226.49s]  Whatever it is possible some old enemy of mine
[1226.73s -> 1228.73s]  I admit I made enemies in my day
[1228.73s -> 1232.89s]  It's possible that one of them in the spirit of revenge has hired this this maniac this
[1233.35s -> 1238.33s]  Professional killer or whatever the gorilla is this note is exactly like the one that was in newspapers
[1238.89s -> 1240.81s]  After you murdered that widow
[1240.81s -> 1242.89s]  Still I can't bring myself to believe it
[1244.18s -> 1246.18s]  Of course, you've notified the police
[1247.02s -> 1252.62s]  No, I haven't but surely if there was anything they never do I've taken other precautions peters and I are armed
[1253.10s -> 1255.98s]  And in addition i've engaged the services of a private detective agency
[1256.54s -> 1259.98s]  Their operative should be here any moment now. Oh, of course not. I didn't call the police
[1260.86s -> 1264.30s]  I called three comedy dickheads that are going to bumble around and break stuff
[1264.78s -> 1269.90s]  And probably blow up the microwaves successes. It is apparent the workings of the police were an open book to him
[1270.46s -> 1275.74s]  Of course, it's a slim chance that by not notifying the police. We might upset his plans
[1276.14s -> 1278.30s]  ordinarily i'm not easily frightened, but
[1279.26s -> 1283.98s]  I must admit this whole affair is giving me the creeps. Well, it's nearly nine o'clock. I suppose you freshen up a bit
[1284.54s -> 1286.54s]  We talk it over after dinner
[1287.37s -> 1289.21s]  I thought about craigslist
[1289.21s -> 1291.59s]  Oh kitty
[1291.59s -> 1296.07s]  Show me some damage to the green room. Mr. Marsden to my room. Yes, sir. Don't worry uncle
[1299.02s -> 1301.02s]  Oh, excuse me, mr stevens
[1301.50s -> 1306.94s]  Yes, kitty. Oh, I know it's no no black and white face game. You're not trying to tell me you're gonna leave me
[1307.18s -> 1311.02s]  Oh, no, sir. I'm trying to tell you I have left you but kitty. You're perfectly safe here
[1311.10s -> 1314.46s]  What besides we have guests you haven't the heart to leave me now
[1315.10s -> 1319.58s]  Well, my heart is willing but i'm gonna have an awful time trying to convince the rest of my body
[1327.83s -> 1331.67s]  Whoopsie we just drove into somebody hack me detective agency
[1333.03s -> 1339.74s]  Don't call the police call it with three toddlers
[1339.98s -> 1344.40s]  I
[1349.93s -> 1353.53s]  What's the joke here
[1353.53s -> 1355.29s]  He can see through it
[1355.29s -> 1358.65s]  I'll bet there's a dead body in every room. That body won't hurt you
[1359.37s -> 1363.21s]  Can't do you any good. It's of rain. I get it. Well, what are we waiting for?
[1364.49s -> 1368.65s]  All right, who's gonna slip in the water? Someone's gonna slip and fall in the rain slip in the puddle step out and slip in the water
[1369.21s -> 1373.69s]  You get my reference tonight chief make it out of there. Uh, keep doing that once in a while. It keeps me on edge
[1373.69s -> 1378.49s]  I'm thinking come on good slip in the water. Now. What are you supposed to want to take this boy? I've got an idea
[1378.81s -> 1380.89s]  Uh, let's go in and find out you're terrific

[1417.85s -> 1424.49s]  I just had to flick a cigarette into the car's casket. I can't even man. I keep thinking of the fucking stupid

[1451.90s -> 1455.42s]  How do you spell gorilla two r's or two l's gorilla? I don't know
[1456.14s -> 1458.62s]  g o r two l's g g o
[1463.10s -> 1465.10s]  Did you did you
[1465.98s -> 1467.98s]  Did you say gorilla?
[1468.86s -> 1470.86s]  My gentleman is not afraid
[1474.06s -> 1478.30s]  Thank you the gorilla coming here, why is it scarier than a fucking murderer?
[1479.26s -> 1486.30s]  Quiet oh did you did you say an animal? Uh, just an animal like a wild animal versus a murderer with motive
[1487.42s -> 1492.30s]  Every door and window is securely bolted. I couldn't have done better myself with us on the job. Mr. Stevens
[1492.38s -> 1497.10s]  You've got nothing to worry about what's your plan? Mr. Harrigan? Well, first, we'll take a look around the house. Come on, man
[1498.06s -> 1502.40s]  Now you just sit tight. Mr. Stevens. The gorilla will get you over our dead bodies
[1503.36s -> 1505.36s]  All right
[1506.64s -> 1509.38s]  It really is the threes to just just more articulate
[1519.33s -> 1521.33s]  Probably the detectives your uncle hired
[1521.81s -> 1526.77s]  Jack i'm terribly worried. What are we going to do? Well, it seems there isn't anything we can do yet
[1527.81s -> 1534.05s]  Listen darling. It isn't that i'm trying to appear skeptical. It's just that well somehow I can't make myself believe all this
[1534.37s -> 1537.73s]  But that note you saw the note, of course I did but still I
[1538.61s -> 1545.89s]  Look darling, we'll wait. We'll wait and see if something really does happen three redditors. I just don't believe it. Well
[1548.53s -> 1549.65s]  Jack

[1566.75s -> 1570.08s]  Excuse me, sir
[1571.04s -> 1576.42s]  He gives me the creeps he doesn't exactly give me enough no, that's the red herring
[1577.86s -> 1579.86s]  That's the red herring. It's not him
[1579.94s -> 1582.42s]  Don't you think there's any cause for alarm? I'm afraid I don't
[1585.90s -> 1594.35s]  Thank you, no
[1594.35s -> 1603.71s]  But I will uh smoke all of your cigarettes. In fact, how many do you have?

[1673.23s -> 1674.91s]  A minor mystery
[1674.91s -> 1678.67s]  Have you any idea who did it? Look shakespeare's been dead hundreds of years
[1679.55s -> 1682.19s]  Hundreds. This is a fine time to call us in on the case
[1682.83s -> 1686.83s]  Say but she couldn't have done it. How do you know she can't be hundreds of years old?
[1687.23s -> 1689.23s]  That's right mark that down garrity
[1690.19s -> 1692.11s]  You two have a look out there i'll look here. Yeah

[1725.58s -> 1729.50s]  Do you want this thing certainly we want it. What do you think we are you're not? Yeah
[1731.58s -> 1733.58s]  Well here take it
[1736.30s -> 1738.30s]  We found it what a psycho
[1739.02s -> 1743.74s]  Well, that's hash. Ain't that a mystery some pretty good tidy chief. I'll be the judge of that
[1744.46s -> 1747.10s]  I'm afraid gentlemen, you won't find the gorilla in there
[1747.18s -> 1753.58s]  There why will we not find the gorilla in there now listen you
[1757.82s -> 1767.52s]  Shit let that be a lesson to you perhaps you gentlemen had better look outside for
[1775.57s -> 1780.75s]  WWE how do you get out of here? That's what i'd like to know and where's the back door and back
[1782.37s -> 1784.37s]  Do the iron again, come on
[1788.16s -> 1794.42s]  I knew it was gonna i'm I think it's funny recall that the paper said the girl always sends a warning to as many as half a
[1794.42s -> 1798.98s]  Dozen people unironically laughing at this because it's just so stupid. Maybe that's what he's doing now
[1799.62s -> 1801.94s]  Perhaps it's just a ruse. Well, let's hope so
[1802.74s -> 1805.54s]  You know, it's wonderful how much more optimistic a good dinner can make one feel
[1806.82s -> 1809.70s]  Shall we have liquors in the study smoking at the table at dinner?
[1812.82s -> 1814.82s]  Oh
[1816.90s -> 1829.92s]  The lights off well the lights off I know no what happened look here it seems to have been thrown in through that window
[1833.01s -> 1835.01s]  12 hours. Oh shit
[1836.03s -> 1840.83s]  What are we going to do the first thing we're going to do or rather jack is going to do
[1841.55s -> 1844.11s]  Is to take you away from here when you're coming with us
[1850.18s -> 1852.18s]  It's him
[1852.18s -> 1853.86s]  Uncle waldo
[1853.86s -> 1855.38s]  Who is it?
[1855.38s -> 1860.08s]  Uh, no. No, he's making a handful of e-boat faces. It could be anybody
[1861.20s -> 1863.20s]  He did give me a turn
[1864.19s -> 1867.63s]  Do you see that face? I bet when he gets drunk snakes see him
[1871.44s -> 1873.44s]  I'm just trying to let you know i'm not the gorilla
[1874.88s -> 1878.56s]  Please the stem be of her Beyonce, mr. Marsden

[1881.20s -> 1882.88s]  guarantee
[1882.88s -> 1884.88s]  This battle seems to be much more serious than I thought
[1885.52s -> 1887.52s]  I've just received this from the gorilla
[1888.56s -> 1890.88s]  I know who brought it. No one brought it
[1891.60s -> 1893.60s]  To throw me through that window
[1896.48s -> 1904.40s]  He's right, this is my good ear
[1904.96s -> 1911.62s]  That was good cat. Oh say that's right. You can't kid us. We're outside patrolling the grounds. What do you mean?
[1912.34s -> 1916.98s]  By the note couldn't have come through that window. But why not? Well, i'll just show you stand back, man
[1919.82s -> 1920.94s]  That's why
[1920.94s -> 1925.42s]  But it was wrapped around the stone a stone a stone. Oh, why didn't you say so?
[1925.82s -> 1927.58s]  Anyway, what do you know about this thing?
[1927.58s -> 1929.10s]  Well, I don't know anything about it

[2011.97s -> 2013.97s]  I don't know. I don't know where that was supposed to be
[2014.53s -> 2016.51s]  That's somebody's basement
[2016.51s -> 2029.66s]  That was a real ape. No, it wasn't that was like
[2030.62s -> 2035.50s]  That scared the fucking shit out of me. God damn boomer jump scares lightning in every movie

[2139.10s -> 2161.92s]  Is it the gorilla?
[2161.92s -> 2176.32s]  Nothing at all. What did he just double barrel shotgun kill something down there? That was like a I shot something with a shotgun sound
[2179.71s -> 2180.77s]  Hey
[2180.77s -> 2183.01s]  Did you just pass here?

[2190.26s -> 2192.26s]  I couldn't say
[2192.58s -> 2194.58s]  Well, maybe we're not here now
[2195.68s -> 2197.04s]  Maybe
[2197.04s -> 2199.04s]  Maybe wait, is he the gorilla?

[2264.69s -> 2268.98s]  I don't know what this is all about. But certainly if there's something to it, the police ought to know about it
[2269.14s -> 2271.14s]  I no longer know what to think
[2271.46s -> 2272.82s]  Perhaps you'd better
[2272.82s -> 2273.86s]  Hello
[2273.86s -> 2276.22s]  Hello

[2307.73s -> 2311.89s]  See, how did you get in here? Why through this door, sir? How can you when the doors are locked?
[2311.97s -> 2314.69s]  I beg your pardon. It was not locked. I locked it myself
[2315.89s -> 2322.05s]  It is locked that leaves us dead locked. It would be impossible for me to walk through the woodwork. Why termites do
[2322.53s -> 2327.34s]  Oh, this isn't getting us anywhere. Now leave everything to me. The gorilla ain't gonna make monkey out of me
[2329.42s -> 2331.42s]  Now you
[2334.06s -> 2341.09s]  But who could

[2376.61s -> 2378.61s]  Point that thing down
[2384.78s -> 2390.46s]  Right from under our very eyes, I don't understand how he got out of here. Oh no
[2392.22s -> 2399.39s]  He's gonna kill her
[2400.35s -> 2405.47s]  What was that
[2410.14s -> 2415.34s]  Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination not unless a hallucination has hair on it come on
[2415.66s -> 2417.90s]  Oh, they can they can
[2420.94s -> 2424.46s]  That's obviously the gorilla
[2424.78s -> 2426.22s]  Who is he?
[2426.22s -> 2431.26s]  I've never seen him before. Do you know him? No, sir. And this is no time for no introductions
[2431.98s -> 2437.18s]  He's not dead. Yeah mark that down too. Come on darling. We're getting out of here. I'm afraid now too for you

[2964.93s -> 2966.93s]  Something screwy about all this
[2967.41s -> 2970.05s]  There's anything screwy about this. It's me

[3464.21s -> 3466.53s]  I don't trust him. Something always happens when you're not here

[3637.51s -> 3643.52s]  Gonna kill him with an umbrella. That's not gonna work. Now. Here's a random guy that's still in the movie somehow
[3644.16s -> 3646.53s]  Where's he been? He's been hiding inside the walls
[3647.41s -> 3660.84s]  Nothing to worry about that's what you think. May I give you some advice? No
[3661.72s -> 3665.88s]  If I were you i'd go to my room and stay there. Oh, yes, sir. I was just planning on that
[3665.96s -> 3670.68s]  Wait a minute. What have you been? No place honest, sir. I was just getting ready to go to town

[3738.77s -> 3742.77s]  I ought to know i've read enough about him. But how could a monkey have possibly written those notes?
[3742.77s -> 3745.81s]  Tucker walter, maybe it's got an education umbrella joke

[3763.04s -> 3764.56s]  Sure a real gorilla
[3764.56s -> 3768.48s]  Uh, so we don't know what we're talking about. Eh, yeah, we know a monkey when we see one
[3768.72s -> 3773.04s]  Listen, this is serious poe ain't no pet. There's no telling what he's liable to do when I ain't around
[3773.76s -> 3777.28s]  He's trained he hates women. Well, what's he doing here? What are you doing here?
[3777.44s -> 3781.60s]  We was hired to come here. We're working at the county fair yesterday. A guy comes along
[3781.84s -> 3785.76s]  He says he wants me to bring poe here. He says he's given a party wants us to put on a wreck
[3786.00s -> 3790.40s]  Who hired you? I don't know. I don't know all I know here
[3790.40s -> 3793.36s]  We're waiting out in the garage like he tells me waiting to do our stuff
[3793.68s -> 3796.72s]  All of a sudden somebody gives me a clunk over the head and I wake up the lady's boudoir
[3796.88s -> 3800.24s]  But the gorilla how did he get loose? You're asking me? That's what I want to find out
[3800.72s -> 3805.84s]  Listen, this is serious. We gotta find him. We got us somebody's liable to get killed then notes from the gorilla
[3806.24s -> 3808.24s]  I told this too
[3808.48s -> 3812.08s]  Notes poe can't write no notes. Even I don't know how to write now
[3812.08s -> 3816.32s]  Look the next time I buck up against that gorilla i'm telling you i'll hit i'll dwell
[3817.28s -> 3824.00s]  I'll you'll never know he'll do it. Listen, have you seen him? Yes. She's in the kitchen. Which way is the kitchen through the panel?
[3824.48s -> 3826.48s]  We'll go with you
[3828.71s -> 3830.95s]  You fellas better wait here there's no telling what that able do
[3833.51s -> 3834.55s]  Jack

[3841.64s -> 3845.32s]  Listen to me everybody the gorilla has done his work
[3845.80s -> 3850.92s]  Walter stevens is dead. You will find his body in the garage. Oh jack
[3852.28s -> 3855.00s]  All right, everybody follow me to the garage. Come on
[3857.67s -> 3862.87s]  Doesn't sound very enthusiastic about it. You'll find his body in the garage

[3882.76s -> 3887.08s]  We need the big reveal police with us around lady. You couldn't we couldn't
[3890.80s -> 3892.72s]  That's right, we didn't
[3892.72s -> 3895.33s]  I gotta find out how that gorilla gets in and out of here
[3896.13s -> 3898.72s]  It must be a secret spring around here someplace
[3899.68s -> 3901.68s]  I think i'll look in the back of these books
[3902.45s -> 3904.77s]  He's gonna get grabbed. He's gonna he's gonna pull the right one
[3905.25s -> 3907.25s]  And he's gonna go
[3908.85s -> 3911.22s]  Yeah
[3922.29s -> 3925.81s]  Imagine getting hit in the head with a fucking brass statue as hard as somebody could do it
[3925.89s -> 3927.97s]  Just turned him into a goofball for five seconds
[3937.16s -> 3950.85s]  He's dead the walk the germo walk
[3953.57s -> 3956.95s]  All right, see this two gorillas here we go flash up the here comes the gorillas
[3958.45s -> 3967.25s]  It's a guy with a gorilla arm, it's gonna be a scooby-doo bullshit
[3967.97s -> 3981.32s]  Don't tell me she's the gorilla. I told you I didn't like them keys. Look under the mat. That's funny
[3981.88s -> 3983.48s]  Oh, very funny
[3983.48s -> 3989.76s]  Will you get listen? What are you doing at poe's cage? What do you think i'm doing waiting for someone to feed me peanuts?
[3990.72s -> 3997.51s]  Don't you know paul hates women sodas kipling. So what will you please get me out of here?
[3998.23s -> 4000.23s]  Hold on. Wait, what?
[4000.71s -> 4008.26s]  How about the other poe that hates women say wait a minute, I think this was a trick to get us out of the house
[4008.34s -> 4012.31s]  Come on
[4019.33s -> 4021.67s]  Whoa, what holy shit
[4024.71s -> 4043.59s]  Is he holding this lady
[4066.24s -> 4085.84s]  How do you catch a gorilla like that, oh no, he made it in he knows he's the fake gorilla
[4088.26s -> 4090.95s]  Break through you can do it
[4097.09s -> 4104.13s]  No, the gorilla was the good guy all along. Thank you. Oh, he hid me a gift right here
[4104.93s -> 4114.53s]  That's an anti-hero gorilla
[4118.29s -> 4120.29s]  You act like that listen here
[4122.63s -> 4124.71s]  No, no kisses
[4124.71s -> 4127.19s]  He might have killed somebody. What do you mean might have?
[4127.75s -> 4140.15s]  And keep them. Okay, scram and take this character with you. Has this lady been awake?
[4141.11s -> 4143.11s]  For a third of this movie
[4163.09s -> 4169.03s]  Look at that
[4172.23s -> 4175.27s]  All right, come on out of there buddy so that's how I got clunked on the head
[4175.75s -> 4178.79s]  Come on. Come on out of there. Yo, I got the slap. I was looking for
[4179.03s -> 4181.27s]  It's opening. Well, come on. Come on, but
[4182.23s -> 4186.55s]  Oh, so it's you. Do you know him? Do I know him? He's the guy I caught using the telephone
[4186.63s -> 4191.99s]  There's no law against that. I don't mind. I'll forget him. I'll just a minute. Do you think you're a little premature premature?
[4192.31s -> 4196.79s]  Well, I can't remember that far back. Just who are you? I'm detective coletti
[4197.35s -> 4203.59s]  An investigator for the securities and exchange commission what i'm on the trail of the gorilla just as you are a detective
[4203.91s -> 4207.43s]  How do we know that? Yeah securities fraud. Well
[4208.23s -> 4210.23s]  What were you doing in there investigating?
[4210.71s -> 4215.43s]  I've been on this case for some weeks now and i've discovered a little about the construction of this house
[4215.91s -> 4218.63s]  That my good friend here don't seem to have found out yet
[4220.71s -> 4224.79s]  Insider trading this house is a maze of secret panels
[4225.35s -> 4229.35s]  Now undoubtedly the voice of the gorilla came through that radio from someplace right in this house
[4229.51s -> 4233.59s]  That means that if we find the wire leading away from the radio, we'd at least find the gorilla's hideout
[4233.67s -> 4247.46s]  It's gonna be the guy that owns the house securities fraud insider trading his big plan
[4250.44s -> 4251.96s]  Just as I thought
[4251.96s -> 4257.08s]  Here's the wire now by tracing this I think we may find the answer to this entire riddle
[4257.88s -> 4259.88s]  The wire goes in here
[4259.88s -> 4264.76s]  Back of this wall is the man we want becomes the third gorilla. It'd be funny. Are you all armed? Yes
[4267.00s -> 4269.00s]  Quiet you here it is
[4269.00s -> 4271.00s]  What
[4272.76s -> 4277.48s]  It is your microphone and as I expected there is your gorilla mr steven's the gorilla
[4277.56s -> 4281.32s]  Well, sure I could have told you that all the time. I guess the party is over my gorilla
[4281.32s -> 4283.88s]  Why is he tied up? Who tied him up like that? I don't know
[4284.52s -> 4289.48s]  He figured the game was up and that this would throw off suspicion. This is a homemade job a child could have done it
[4289.56s -> 4293.16s]  Ah, it's preposterous. Don't believe him. I never saw this man before in my life. It's insane
[4295.43s -> 4297.86s]  Now what's that?
[4297.94s -> 4301.56s]  Uh-oh third gorilla theory incoming
[4308.39s -> 4311.52s]  alias the gorilla
[4316.47s -> 4324.76s]  You can make that two thousand go walter the gorilla. I don't believe it. I think I can make it very clear
[4324.92s -> 4330.92s]  Oh, sure. We can now first of all, what's that? Uh-oh. I didn't hear a thing. Neither did I but what was it?
[4333.76s -> 4339.84s]  Hey, what is this who hit me what's going on around here? It's that man again. Oh, there you are
[4340.24s -> 4347.44s]  Kidnapped kidnapped by the gorilla not kidnapped by the gorilla. Mr. Conway ap conway. The ap stands for ape
[4347.84s -> 4352.80s]  Mr. Conway, this gentleman is the gorilla the gorilla, but if uncle walter's the gorilla
[4353.28s -> 4357.76s]  Well, haven't the gorilla been killing people those notes of warning? Oh, the gorilla's been killing people
[4358.64s -> 4362.40s]  The beginning of the movie and to throw off suspicion from himself. Mr. Envy
[4363.12s -> 4367.46s]  Under the terms of your father's will if anything were to happen to you this dude's a terrorist
[4368.26s -> 4374.54s]  Uncle walter my hunch was right. Your uncle brought you here tonight to kill you for your money
[4374.86s -> 4378.54s]  Well, at least he had a reason so that's why he wouldn't let us call the police
[4378.70s -> 4384.06s]  That's exactly why but what about these men these private detectives? They almost speak for themselves
[4384.78s -> 4391.42s]  Do you think if steven's life had actually been threatened he would have called in three morons such as these holy shit
[4392.22s -> 4394.22s]  That's what i'm saying
[4394.78s -> 4399.56s]  Why resent that but I tell you I saw the gorilla right there in that closet
[4399.56s -> 4404.52s]  I saw his hand in his arm and it was no optical confusion. What you saw was this sleeve
[4405.56s -> 4410.52s]  Another ingenious little invention of mr. Stevens. It's a very cute little idea
[4411.24s -> 4412.28s]  Well
[4412.28s -> 4414.28s]  That about clears the whole matter up
[4415.08s -> 4421.80s]  And since it stopped raining, I think I better go you're okay buddy. He's all right. Congratulations. Let me congratulate you
[4421.80s -> 4423.80s]  Thanks for calling us moron
[4424.44s -> 4426.44s]  Wait a minute
[4426.84s -> 4428.36s]  I know you don't buddy
[4428.36s -> 4435.08s]  Okay, folks say howdy to the gorilla. What all right give out or this moron is gonna blow your brains out
[4435.56s -> 4437.56s]  Well, you see it was only that
[4438.92s -> 4440.92s]  He just has a really hairy hand
[4441.56s -> 4445.16s]  But the cops haven't been able to get me. So don't you halfwits get any crazy notions?
[4445.80s -> 4448.60s]  And that's what is for steven's he's just as crooked as I told you he was
[4448.92s -> 4451.16s]  The trouble with him is he talks too much and too loud
[4451.72s -> 4455.32s]  I got tipped off on what was going to happen here tonight how he was going to pretend to be me
[4455.72s -> 4460.36s]  I was going to get the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and at the same time let him get the blame for all the gorilla murders
[4461.56s -> 4467.42s]  Are you better careful? You could have just said I haven't been manscaping lately then you'd be fine nervous tonight
[4468.86s -> 4471.48s]  I advise you not to move
[4472.76s -> 4479.42s]  Please say some quickly. What is this? I thought the phone was out of order. Maybe he paid his bill. Hello
[4479.90s -> 4481.74s]  This is walter steven speaking
[4481.74s -> 4483.50s]  Send a squad car to my house
[4483.50s -> 4488.54s]  We've got the gorilla things are so mixed up around here that even the gorilla doesn't know who the gorilla is
[4489.11s -> 4493.72s]  He's the gorilla. He's the gorilla. Look what's going on here. They're all gorilla
[4494.44s -> 4499.32s]  Don't look so sad darling. Your uncle isn't a crook comes the real reveal safe and sound now
[4500.04s -> 4502.68s]  You know, you never can tell this is liable to wind up to be a mystery
[4503.00s -> 4505.72s]  You see the gorilla murders were threatened to bank up our insurance company
[4506.12s -> 4511.72s]  Most of the victims were clans of ours. So conway our special investigator cooked up his little scheme to trap the killer
[4512.12s -> 4517.24s]  I'm sorry. I had to frighten you dear and you too kitty. Oh, I wasn't frightened. I was numb
[4517.72s -> 4521.32s]  You fellas are certainly great detectives. Oh, yeah, we could have told you that
[4521.72s -> 4525.48s]  Did you know that claddy was the gorilla all along? Sure we did. No, we didn't
[4525.72s -> 4529.16s]  When did you find out he was the gorilla when I shook hands with him? I don't get you
[4529.24s -> 4534.44s]  Well, you see I was a winter trimmer in a department store and I ought to know a phony feel when I feel one
[4535.72s -> 4538.36s]  We'll never be able to thank you. Mr. Harrigan. Oh, well, that's all right
[4538.92s -> 4544.12s]  I understand you two are getting married soon. Well, if you call tomorrow soon, well, remember if you have any trouble with her
[4544.52s -> 4546.52s]  Our specialty is following wives
[4551.56s -> 4555.40s]  You know where to send a check and be sure it's certified from a confederate bank
[4558.44s -> 4567.11s]  Oh one more thing bye. Oh, that's good. I love them. I love the bye the end
[4568.07s -> 4578.82s]  The time meets the space monster well, that's gonna have to be that's gonna have to be for a different time
[4581.58s -> 4590.98s]  That was that was very that was I loved it. I loved it. We're gonna take a little intermission break
[4591.99s -> 4593.59s]  I'm gonna get another drink
[4593.59s -> 4600.39s]  And we're gonna come back with uh this plan from outer space nine. Whatever the hell it is. I'll be right back

[4895.75s -> 4900.31s]  I said the movie was unironically funny to me. What a gem reminds me of the old three stooges
[4900.71s -> 4902.87s]  I can't believe the last line of the movie was bye
[4907.37s -> 4911.48s]  Uh, we're gonna have to take that as a uh, I think as a tip
[4911.80s -> 4915.50s]  We're gonna have to watch more uh fucking ritz brothers movies
[4915.82s -> 4920.86s]  That's the first taste of the I think a lot of the ritz brothers movies are in public domain

[4991.32s -> 4994.20s]  This movie has nudity

[5359.11s -> 5361.11s]  So the shower curtain behind them
[5363.34s -> 5368.86s]  It would be fucking hilarious if they pulled that back and a guy was taking a shower right there. Oh damn it. Take a look for yourself
[5373.80s -> 5375.80s]  That's nothing from this world
[5379.85s -> 5384.41s]  What are those steering wheels mayday mayday stand by burbank tower you suppose the passenger side
[5384.73s -> 5388.57s]  I doubt that most of them are asleep, but it was quite a joke jeff. I'll check good

[5397.69s -> 5411.64s]  That's the plane
[5411.88s -> 5427.27s]  Jesus christ, did you hear anything? I thought it did don't like hearing noises, especially when he's supposed to be any
[5427.96s -> 5434.89s]  Yeah, sort of spooky like maybe we're getting old whatever it is gone now. That's the best thing for us
[5435.77s -> 5440.74s]  Like i'm watching a bad lip reading video. Am I sure that's not what this is that I clicked the right thing
[5441.06s -> 5477.88s]  Oh look at those hands his wife's death became greater and greater agony
[5478.36s -> 5487.40s]  The home they had so long shared together
[5488.46s -> 5493.58s]  Became a tomb this is sad a sweet memory of her joyous living
[5495.48s -> 5497.56s]  The sky to which she had once looked
[5498.36s -> 5501.32s]  Was now only a covering for her dead body
[5502.79s -> 5512.52s]  jesus
[5512.52s -> 5514.52s]  This narrator is fucked
[5515.16s -> 5519.26s]  Beautiful flowers she had planted
[5520.50s -> 5522.34s]  with her own hands
[5522.34s -> 5526.42s]  Became nothing more than the lost roses of her cheeks
[5532.36s -> 5536.52s]  Confused by his great loss the old man left that home
[5537.56s -> 5540.52s]  Never to return again. What wait?
[5542.12s -> 5547.50s]  Did he sell it?
[5548.14s -> 5550.14s]  Did he move his furniture out
[5550.22s -> 5555.08s]  at the funeral of the old man
[5555.48s -> 5559.48s]  Unknown to his mourners. He's dead his dead wife
[5560.28s -> 5564.58s]  Was watching first his wife then he tragic
[5565.62s -> 5568.98s]  Why is that door only like five feet tall? Why was his wife buried in the ground?
[5571.32s -> 5578.33s]  Something to do with family tradition a superstition of some sort. Oh, well, it's getting dark. Let's be in our way
[5583.61s -> 5587.29s]  Then as two of his mourners left his final resting place
[5591.59s -> 5593.59s]  Two dummies
[5594.15s -> 5596.15s]  Wait, why couldn't they just lie on the ground?
[5596.95s -> 5598.95s]  What's the I don't understand
[5599.03s -> 5602.31s]  The actors couldn't lie on the ground for a second. Why?
[5607.14s -> 5609.14s]  Somebody had to make that shit
[5609.22s -> 5619.94s]  It took probably three or four days to make them. They were too old to lie on the ground
[5619.94s -> 5623.75s]  No, one of them was like 40. I don't buy that for a second later
[5623.83s -> 5632.15s]  The police led by inspector daniel clay arrived at the scene who found them the man and girl medical
[5632.55s -> 5639.48s]  Exterminer, where's the gorilla just left the morgue wagon ought to be along most any time you get their statement
[5640.28s -> 5646.98s]  Yeah, as much as we could they're pretty scared finding a mess like this ought to make anyone frightened
[5648.01s -> 5653.85s]  Have one of the boys take the guy and the girl back to town. You take it. Okay inspector
[5653.93s -> 5655.93s]  What are you going to do knock it around?
[5656.73s -> 5659.69s]  Pretty dark out there. What once you get beyond the range of those lights
[5659.77s -> 5663.85s]  You won't be able to see your hand in front of your face. This is an snl skit. That's dan ackroy in the middle
[5664.89s -> 5686.92s]  Be careful, but i'm a big boy now johnny. He'll smoke
[5690.26s -> 5693.22s]  You guys think that's fog. No, no, no, this is what the 30s looked like
[5694.30s -> 5708.33s]  Every motherfucker smoked
[5708.33s -> 5714.95s]  50s. Yeah, whatever
[5714.95s -> 5717.75s]  This was every bar and restaurant in fucking 1955
[5733.19s -> 5741.75s]  Say lieutenant to get that funny odor. How could I miss it? Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now
[5742.07s -> 5747.45s]  I thought they were dummies. I thought they were fucking mannequins. I was about to say why
[5748.89s -> 5751.53s]  A lot of police cars and lights I stopped but I didn't see anything
[5752.92s -> 5755.48s]  Oh, well, whatever it is. It's a mosquito
[5762.78s -> 5766.70s]  The fence you seem to still be up there somewhere. Yeah, that's pretty fucked up
[5767.26s -> 5771.34s]  Maybe I am why is this so bent? I don't think i've ever seen you in this mood before
[5773.75s -> 5783.70s]  They're at a cardboard. This is because i've never been in this mood before something about your flight
[5786.82s -> 5790.34s]  Even his clothes look fake like his shirt looks like it's made out of fucking cardboard
[5797.50s -> 5799.66s]  I saw a flying saucer
[5799.66s -> 5803.11s]  Saucer you mean the kind from up there?
[5803.83s -> 5806.50s]  Yeah, it's kind of part
[5806.50s -> 5809.78s]  It was shaped like a huge cigar dan either saw it too
[5810.42s -> 5814.58s]  When it passed over the whole compartment lighted up with a blinding glare you mean the sky
[5814.58s -> 5819.22s]  Yeah, tremendous wind it practically knocked us off our course. Did you report it? Yeah
[5819.94s -> 5822.82s]  Radioed in immediately and they said we'll keep it quiet until you land
[5823.54s -> 5828.66s]  As soon as we landed big army brass grabbed us and made us swear to secrecy about the whole thing
[5830.12s -> 5833.56s]  Burns me up. These things have been seen for years. They're here. It's a fact
[5834.28s -> 5837.96s]  And the public ought to know about it. There must be something more you can do about it
[5838.12s -> 5841.00s]  Only there isn't all but what's the use of making a fuss?
[5841.96s -> 5847.10s]  But last night I saw a flying object. They couldn't have possibly been from this planet
[5847.10s -> 5853.05s]  Honey, you should make a bunch of facebook posts about it muzzle by army brass. I can't even admit I saw the thing
[5855.03s -> 5871.59s]  Fuck
[5871.59s -> 5898.92s]  Rumor she's here. Is anybody gonna say anything say something?
[5899.96s -> 5932.66s]  We talk. Okay. I can't just be me. Oh, you know, he's a villain money. Oh, it's his arm. I'm about to get his nose
[5933.94s -> 5947.30s]  With a big cape. It's the butler again. Oh god
[5947.94s -> 5958.63s]  What where is where all the what where's the officers? Where is everybody?
[5964.42s -> 5976.92s]  Shoot him shoot him with your gun sounds like pay in trouble
[5977.24s -> 5980.44s]  Oh
[5993.90s -> 5996.30s]  Paula and russell, oh no, he's dead
[6000.00s -> 6002.81s]  Somebody said na aim
[6003.37s -> 6015.47s]  God. Ah, it looks like he wanted me invited to tsm. Is he dead? Yeah
[6017.77s -> 6019.77s]  He's messed up as bad as those two back there
[6020.01s -> 6027.16s]  Suppose that saucer or whatever it was had something to do with this their guess is good as mine, larry
[6028.17s -> 6031.29s]  Don't itch your neck with a gun. Oh my god, what are you doing?
[6032.43s -> 6034.43s]  He's gonna kill himself
[6036.99s -> 6039.47s]  You're in charge now lieutenant, yeah
[6040.43s -> 6044.75s]  This is like freaking me the fuck out his finger on the trigger. He's itching his neck with the barrel of the gun
[6045.07s -> 6048.91s]  Tell the coroner he's got to make another trip out here. Well, how about the lab boys?
[6049.47s -> 6059.79s]  Who do you think we left back up the car boy scouts? Come on. Oh, no another funeral
[6060.03s -> 6064.03s]  It's just this fucking same day than to lay down his life
[6064.51s -> 6071.21s]  For another it is always difficult to have last words over the grave of a friend
[6072.16s -> 6077.12s]  An inspector daniel clay was a friend a dear friend to me
[6077.76s -> 6083.52s]  And to all of us by the way, who's the scary lady in makeup and in costume?
[6084.32s -> 6089.05s]  Now we lay him to rest a rest well deserved
[6090.51s -> 6092.51s]  So premature
[6095.66s -> 6101.66s]  At the funeral there's more than one flying saucer
[6104.36s -> 6109.16s]  People turning south from the freeway were startled when they saw three flying saucers
[6118.72s -> 6121.12s]  saucers seen over hollywood
[6123.53s -> 6126.16s]  Whoa
[6126.48s -> 6135.05s]  It's not a rainbow in the sky telephones. Oh look, there's a rainbow forming over there kind of cool. I guess
[6136.57s -> 6155.98s]  Why was that so hard like his shit face there comes a time in each man's life
[6156.30s -> 6158.86s]  But he can't even believe his own eyes
[6162.59s -> 6171.04s]  Okay, saucers seen over hollywood flying saucers seen over washington dc
[6172.64s -> 6180.52s]  At the military convoy moved into the field
[6186.19s -> 6190.38s]  missile launchers
[6190.38s -> 6199.79s]  Already quickly set up colonel tom edwards in charge of saucer field activities
[6200.51s -> 6202.91s]  Was to make the greatest decision of his career
[6203.55s -> 6205.55s]  He made that decision
[6205.71s -> 6208.43s]  Colonel edwards gave the signal to fire
[6208.43s -> 6210.43s]  There
[6210.91s -> 6219.24s]  All of them missed
[6219.24s -> 6221.56s]  Not one rocket hit its location target
[6231.29s -> 6233.29s]  In the chat you can see
[6234.73s -> 6236.73s]  Nice air shot noob
[6249.47s -> 6253.61s]  Molding he must be pretending
[6254.33s -> 6257.77s]  Is the entire united states military pretending?
[6259.10s -> 6261.34s]  These were the things that the local citizens were saying
[6275.18s -> 6280.54s]  They were gone even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters
[6280.78s -> 6284.62s]  They weren't even moving they were standing still even I could do that
[6285.18s -> 6293.28s]  Quite a sight wasn't it sir a sight i'd rather not be seeing are you worried about them, sir?
[6293.68s -> 6295.68s]  No, i'm worried about your comedy radio
[6296.25s -> 6305.07s]  Visits that would indicate visitors the big guns a usual way of welcoming visitors. We haven't always fired at them
[6305.55s -> 6312.59s]  Oh for a time we tried to contact them by radio, but no response then they attacked a town
[6313.37s -> 6318.91s]  When where a small town i'll admit but nevertheless a town of people it's a made-up government conspiracy
[6321.53s -> 6323.53s]  All right, I need to rewind
[6323.53s -> 6330.25s]  I i'm rewinding what the fuck did he say a sight i'd rather not be seeing are you worried about them, sir?
[6330.65s -> 6337.12s]  Well, they must have a reason for their visits visits. That would indicate visitors. They killed people they died
[6337.52s -> 6341.06s]  I made this up right now to justify firing 10 000
[6341.54s -> 6344.34s]  Mistrels at them that were 500 million dollars for a time
[6344.34s -> 6351.55s]  We tried to contact them by radio, but no response then they attacked a town a small town
[6351.63s -> 6358.10s]  I'll admit but nevertheless a town of people people who died. I never heard about that, sir
[6358.67s -> 6363.46s]  Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon take any fire
[6363.78s -> 6369.98s]  And that's all I need to say to get another 500 billion dollars in revenue then wonder flying
[6369.98s -> 6379.20s]  Actual life are still a rumor officially. I'd like to beat them off again, sir
[6379.60s -> 6385.30s]  What do they want? Where are they from? Where are they going? They sir?
[6385.86s -> 6392.56s]  Who? Well, this is a training maneuver, sir. We only did a little practice firing at the clouds. What?
[6393.87s -> 6400.26s]  Yeah, I wonder what their next move will be so they would deliberately not hitting them
[6404.00s -> 6407.36s]  Are you sure you can't use some of the tax dollars to rebuild a few schools?
[6409.17s -> 6412.67s]  Really guys, what will their next move be?
[6418.69s -> 6423.76s]  Your space commander has returned from earth send him in wait. They're just people
[6429.47s -> 6435.08s]  It's a it's a race of bob. Hope we had to pull in here to space station seven for regeneration
[6435.54s -> 6444.61s]  We're returning to the planet earth immediately thereafter. What progress has been made we contacted government officials. They refuse our existence
[6444.93s -> 6449.52s]  What plan will you follow now plan nine?
[6450.21s -> 6458.16s]  It's been absolutely impossible to work through these earth creatures. Their soul is too controlled plan nine
[6459.38s -> 6462.90s]  Ah, yes plan nine deals with the resurrection of the dead
[6463.74s -> 6470.38s]  Long distance electrode shortens opinion pituitary grounds of recent dead. Have you attempted any of this plan as yet?
[6470.70s -> 6476.05s]  Yes, excellency how successful I want one of these costumes. We have risen too so far
[6476.45s -> 6483.34s]  We shall be just as successful on more the living they have no suspicion of your movements
[6483.74s -> 6485.74s]  We had to dispose of one policeman
[6485.82s -> 6490.96s]  However, none of those risen have been seen at least not by anyone who still remains alive
[6491.12s -> 6498.14s]  It's too bad. It must be handled this way, but it must those who we take from the grave
[6498.22s -> 6504.80s]  We can't wait for that curtain to open it is mario free continue on report to me in two earth days
[6509.87s -> 6512.35s]  I feared his excellency wouldn't take our report this well
[6512.59s -> 6515.87s]  Well had he been dealing with her own people his reaction would have been completely different
[6516.48s -> 6518.48s]  He understands the difficulties of the earth race
[6519.12s -> 6522.48s]  What do you think will be the next obstacle the earth people will put in our way?
[6522.56s -> 6523.76s]  He looks what's he gonna draw?
[6523.76s -> 6526.88s]  Just gonna draw on them as long as they can think we'll have our problems
[6527.28s -> 6533.82s]  But those whom we're using cannot think they are the dead brought to a simulated life by our electrode guns
[6534.54s -> 6535.34s]  No
[6535.34s -> 6536.30s]  You know
[6536.30s -> 6543.46s]  It's an interesting thing when you consider the earth people who can think are so frightened by those who cannot the dead
[6544.08s -> 6547.76s]  They didn't even think they like put them in makeup or something. Our ship should be regenerated. We better get started
[6547.84s -> 6553.50s]  They just have different clothes on oh they aliens. They're just like we're just people with clothes on
[6555.06s -> 6562.03s]  These earthlings which we all of us are in this room the producers didn't think to even dye our hair green
[6562.43s -> 6602.66s]  Where's the tie fighter sound? Hello, honey. I'm back from the set wall where there's nothing behind us
[6603.92s -> 6616.80s]  I still think you're going nothing's going to take me from it besides most men try and keep their wives from going home
[6617.84s -> 6620.40s]  It's not the point. That's all the point. There's going to be
[6621.82s -> 6623.82s]  Why is he leaving for work at night?
[6624.14s -> 6626.14s]  I don't people work nights, man
[6626.46s -> 6631.15s]  What are you talking about?
[6631.23s -> 6637.31s]  It's a weird kiss that was like a he fucked that up. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got hold on
[6639.36s -> 6645.20s]  Will you tell him to pick another house to watch this kiss that was he fucking missed that so much
[6645.20s -> 6650.88s]  Don't worry about me. He like opened his bottom lip and she right now she's thinking fuck. That was so wet and gross
[6651.28s -> 6659.07s]  They're up there, but there's something in that cemetery. I can't wait to fucking wipe my arm on my mouth when he says cut
[6661.02s -> 6666.54s]  The saucers are up there and the cemeteries out there, but i'll be locked up in there
[6668.61s -> 6670.61s]  Now what the fuck are they doing?
[6671.01s -> 6674.53s]  What are you doing? You promise you like the first time they've ever kissed a human
[6675.49s -> 6680.29s]  He said these are the aliens. These are the aliens down here with your pillow. I figured it out. I know the whole movie
[6683.02s -> 6685.66s]  I have to have something to keep me company while you're away
[6686.80s -> 6689.20s]  Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely
[6690.16s -> 6692.53s]  I reach over and touch it
[6692.69s -> 6696.21s]  Then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore. Wait, do you reach over and touch his what?
[6697.25s -> 6699.06s]  crazy kid
[6699.06s -> 6708.56s]  What who are you touching? What's going on? I do love you darling
[6715.84s -> 6717.36s]  These humans don't
[6717.36s -> 6719.36s]  These are not humans
[6719.36s -> 6725.20s]  That hurt that hurt both of them. They both are in pain right now physical pain. See you thursday. Goodbye, honey
[6726.37s -> 6730.13s]  You could see three distinct rolls on the side of his face that hurt them
[6730.99s -> 6733.31s]  You know, i'm not leaving here until you lock. What's the pressure?
[6746.86s -> 6754.69s]  If you're especially nice, I'm hey, make sure you smoke in the house. You keep the yard lights on smoke everywhere
[6755.01s -> 6763.26s]  Don't worry the yellow stains on the fucking ceiling and the walls 30 years from now won't drop the property value of our home
[6763.98s -> 6782.91s]  Why wouldn't I guess i'm preoccupied Danny?
[6784.67s -> 6790.59s]  We've got 33 passengers back there that have time to be preoccupied flying this flyer bird doesn't give you that opportunity
[6790.83s -> 6794.75s]  Is that a clock in the top left or a plate? I don't know. That's a weird clock
[6796.42s -> 6800.42s]  It's a clock. There's nothing wrong between you two. Oh, no, nothing like that
[6800.90s -> 6804.82s]  Just that i'm worried she being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and
[6805.30s -> 6809.06s]  Those incidents in the graveyard these past few days just just got me worried
[6809.54s -> 6812.42s]  Well, maybe they haven't figured out those crazy skybird yet
[6812.42s -> 6816.74s]  But I give you a 50 to one odds the police have cleared out that cemetery thing by now. I hope so
[6817.14s -> 6822.50s]  If you're really that worried Jeff, why don't you go radio in and find out really wish you would let me on your fucking animal crossing
[6822.58s -> 6824.58s]  Island, uh some my turnips jake
[6825.58s -> 6827.90s]  Hi, kind of fucking annoying that you haven't invited me yet
[6827.98s -> 6832.62s]  From this end of the plane since we left the field i've just been giving himself and me a study in silence
[6833.02s -> 6835.66s]  Your boys aren't feuding. I don't want to bring it up. I will
[6836.30s -> 6838.94s]  Hey, how about you and me balling it up in albuquerque?
[6839.58s -> 6844.38s]  Have you read that flight schedule boy? What about it? Well, that was relevant albuquerque at 4 a.m
[6844.78s -> 6849.58s]  That's strictly a nine o'clock town. Well, I know a friend that'll help us. Let's have a problem first
[6850.38s -> 6854.06s]  Ah, he's worried about paula. I read about that shit. All right
[6854.70s -> 6857.66s]  Let's take the loss two kids not to buy too near one of those things
[6858.38s -> 6860.38s]  We get there soon enough as it is
[6860.46s -> 6865.50s]  He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there. No doubt about that. It's quite all right like a tomb
[6866.30s -> 6868.67s]  I'm, sorry jeff. That was a bad joke
[6869.07s -> 6874.67s]  Say I almost forgot when I came in me too. I know what it's like coffee situation. That's for me. It sure would hurt
[6875.71s -> 6878.99s]  Okay, be right back and say jeff make that call to me
[6879.39s -> 6885.55s]  Nah, not only she throw cold water on my albuquerque clan, but now she's repeating herself and someone put their fucking hands on the wheel
[6886.03s -> 6888.03s]  I can't resist your child anybody
[6888.99s -> 6901.46s]  Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder the flash of lightning
[6902.50s -> 6907.94s]  But from the blast arose the moving figure of the dead old man
[6911.55s -> 6913.55s]  This looks like a deep fake
[6913.95s -> 6915.95s]  It's like a richard nixon deep fake
[6917.68s -> 6929.92s]  How embarrassing if we put richard nixon's face on here the hospital bed is that a bed
[6933.01s -> 6935.41s]  Why is a fire alarm your ringtone?
[6936.05s -> 6957.47s]  Okay, mac
[6957.47s -> 6958.91s]  Look at that picture up there
[6958.91s -> 6960.61s]  That's not
[6960.61s -> 6967.44s]  Look, that's not even the two people that live in this house. These are two random fucking people
[6968.00s -> 6971.60s]  We're led to believe that's her and him. Nope. That's two random people
[6972.24s -> 6985.66s]  I don't know who the fuck they are
[6985.66s -> 7004.24s]  there's
[7004.24s -> 7006.40s]  Wait, what? Huh? Am I going fucking crazy?
[7006.56s -> 7023.39s]  Hi, mac. Am I going insane? Sure. I'm all right. That's not even the that's a superimposed photo
[7024.03s -> 7028.48s]  Is it that's not even the picture that's there?
[7032.85s -> 7038.00s]  What the fuck?
[7038.00s -> 7048.50s]  deep fake
[7048.50s -> 7052.34s]  Okay, I I could take this guy I could take that i'll pick up a lamp and hit him in the fucking head
[7052.82s -> 7056.18s]  You know what I mean? Like if you're just like putting your hand on your mouth and like going like this
[7056.42s -> 7058.82s]  No, no, no, give me the phone. I'll fucking bash you in the head with that phone
[7060.10s -> 7064.13s]  And apparently they live right next to a graveyard
[7065.52s -> 7067.52s]  They live on the graveyard
[7068.00s -> 7072.40s]  Holy shit, we're talking property value cigarette smoke graveyard. This house was 40 dollars
[7072.80s -> 7092.58s]  They got this house at auction. Why was it? Yeah, what?
[7093.22s -> 7095.22s]  Wasn't it just nighttime?
[7095.22s -> 7099.48s]  daytime
[7099.48s -> 7102.28s]  All right. This lady is doing the I have a dump in my pants walk
[7103.68s -> 7105.84s]  Like this is the walk you do when you shit your pants
[7109.68s -> 7114.24s]  You freeze and you fucking just slowly just move your hands up and down and move shimmy
[7116.64s -> 7121.68s]  Did it go through the underwear into my pants? I hope it's just the underwear because I can take those off
[7122.16s -> 7126.48s]  I can take the underwear off and put the pants back on but fuck. Hopefully it didn't go through
[7127.52s -> 7140.31s]  This dark vader
[7140.31s -> 7142.31s]  There's a vader up there
[7161.19s -> 7162.63s]  The egg
[7162.63s -> 7193.20s]  Kind of does look like the egg, huh?
[7193.20s -> 7195.20s]  Why are you running through the graveyard?
[7196.84s -> 7199.72s]  Get to her road
[7199.80s -> 7201.80s]  Finally, thank you
[7204.29s -> 7222.02s]  Um when he knows who this is
[7235.81s -> 7237.81s]  He's talking about the egg
[7238.13s -> 7243.73s]  That's the egg right there. That's like the tucked in fan of the pants pulled up like steve urkel with tucked in
[7244.37s -> 7246.37s]  That's the egg
[7247.25s -> 7257.84s]  Okay, run him over
[7257.84s -> 7259.84s]  Just drive over that guy's head
[7261.99s -> 7263.59s]  Run over his head
[7263.59s -> 7265.83s]  I bet you probably get cursed forever or something, right?
[7266.55s -> 7268.23s]  Yeah, it's not a good idea
[7270.84s -> 7275.56s]  Why am I getting like the holy shit psycho face? This is dracula run his fucking head over
[7276.37s -> 7278.37s]  What and that makes me a psycho?
[7278.84s -> 7282.92s]  Run over that guy's head. He's a he's a dracula psycho killer guy
[7283.64s -> 7291.86s]  What i'm trying to get rid of him. No, i'll go ask him for directions guys. That's a good idea
[7302.48s -> 7321.24s]  We're gonna get another funeral
[7321.24s -> 7323.24s]  That's a home video camera
[7323.24s -> 7324.60s]  pointing at him
[7324.60s -> 7326.92s]  He's testing out his cosplay for the next convention
[7328.87s -> 7330.87s]  That was not meant to be released to the public at all
[7333.24s -> 7357.67s]  His iCloud got hacked. It's like that's unfortunate. He'll be at the hatch in a moment. You can open it now, tana
[7357.99s -> 7363.75s]  So we're back in the ufo
[7370.88s -> 7372.88s]  Where does that letter go
[7376.68s -> 7378.68s]  You're late for dinner you three
[7379.16s -> 7389.86s]  They can't tell us from anyone else. Oh brussels sprouts again mom
[7392.15s -> 7410.85s]  Sit down and eat. It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for
[7411.09s -> 7415.41s]  I don't think the lieutenant does either then what are we doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago
[7415.57s -> 7419.01s]  Oh, don't ask me any questions. I'm just a hard hand just like you
[7426.87s -> 7433.03s]  Cole phelps what do you suppose that noise was whatever it was. It's no more strange any other things happening around this cemetery
[7434.15s -> 7440.72s]  Spirits like old farmer caller talked about what maybe the only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath
[7440.88s -> 7446.24s]  Oh, don't forget. Mr. Trent claims to have seen them too. She didn't have anything on her breath. God damn it was hysterical
[7446.80s -> 7453.30s]  True she was frightened and then to stay the shock, but don't forget that thorn knight gone in the scratch feet
[7454.55s -> 7456.40s]  Yeah, I
[7456.40s -> 7462.44s]  Hadn't thought of that guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant and i'm still a uniformed cop
[7463.33s -> 7467.49s]  Sometimes it's only the brakes larry. See we don't give a shit like how far can you fit this gun down your mouth?
[7467.89s -> 7471.57s]  Let me check let me do it too. It was strange. We don't give a fuck no more than you do
[7471.81s -> 7478.79s]  Went for orders I get out of here makes you say that you remember the noise we heard the other night
[7479.19s -> 7486.55s]  We were not to the ground how could I forget exactly but you're not remembering that sound there you're wrong lieutenant
[7487.19s -> 7490.95s]  I'm with the fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?
[7491.19s -> 7496.87s]  Well, haven't you heard and many times the saucer hasn't had a goal or a light of any kind for that matter
[7498.07s -> 7502.87s]  That proves it what next lieutenant. Oh lieutenant. I wanted to take that hat off
[7503.43s -> 7507.11s]  And fucking wicked long beautiful hair just blows down
[7507.51s -> 7512.87s]  Uh, why come on man out with it. We haven't got all data waste. Oh, uh, just uh over there beyond the crib
[7513.03s -> 7516.66s]  All right, show us away
[7516.66s -> 7526.60s]  Look here. Here it is lieutenant. Yeah, it's been broken into all right strange
[7527.08s -> 7529.96s]  If someone had broken in the dirt should be piled up here
[7530.12s -> 7532.44s]  How long do we have the lease on this warehouse for the graveyard?
[7533.00s -> 7535.56s]  Might as well use the fuck out of it for every single scene in the movie
[7541.32s -> 7548.32s]  This spot look we shouldn't investigate any further without the permission of the next akin. Let's go get it
[7548.72s -> 7555.48s]  How I see what you mean the gravestones down there well, let's go down and find out whose grave it is really
[7555.48s -> 7561.03s]  I'm doing that stance quit doing that stand. You're copying me now. Are you sure you mean that lieutenant?
[7561.11s -> 7567.65s]  If I didn't mean it, I wouldn't have said it scared. Well, why do I get hooked up with these spooked details?
[7568.19s -> 7570.19s]  monsters graves bodies
[7571.01s -> 7584.15s]  All right, it's the ritz brothers with an added brother caskets here, but nobody's in it
[7584.63s -> 7589.89s]  Can you read the name on the casket? It's too dark
[7590.69s -> 7597.40s]  Give me a flashlight. How about a match? We sure could buy a cigarette. Let me have them. Okay
[7601.14s -> 7609.01s]  Here have a cigarette. These were like eating apples in the 40s. Inspector clay's grave, but he ain't in it
[7609.33s -> 7621.17s]  But meanwhile at the pentagon in washington dc these guys are still flying this plane
[7621.73s -> 7626.18s]  Are they ever gonna land?
[7626.18s -> 7639.28s]  Right g2 come in. Yes, of course keep in touch. Come in colonel avers
[7639.28s -> 7644.21s]  Yes
[7644.93s -> 7651.01s]  One star general why is that so why is that I don't know why that's funny what he
[7651.89s -> 7656.79s]  Understand colonel. You've been tapped for many of our saucer attacks. Why is that funny?
[7656.79s -> 7663.73s]  I don't charge a field operation, sir. Well the mic there are such things as flying sauces colonel
[7668.02s -> 7675.92s]  Where's the mic there's a mic in the frame in washington dc
[7676.56s -> 7684.40s]  I didn't even see it right g2 where
[7686.00s -> 7690.92s]  Come in yes, of course keep in touch
[7693.78s -> 7703.80s]  Come in colonel avers close the door at ease colonel. Thank you, sir. Sit down
[7704.20s -> 7708.68s]  I'm just waiting for like a guy in glasses with like a notepad to walk in and just be like oops and see the camera
[7708.68s -> 7710.68s]  And walk back like a script supervisor
[7715.00s -> 7717.00s]  I'm in charge of field operation, sir
[7718.26s -> 7723.78s]  You believe there are such things as flying sauces colonel, yes, sir uncrowned
[7724.50s -> 7726.23s]  Yes, sir
[7726.23s -> 7731.51s]  You realize there's a government directive stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer
[7732.23s -> 7741.22s]  Yes, sir. You stand by your statement that you've seen flying saucers. Well, uh, yes, sir
[7743.06s -> 7751.62s]  This could mean a court martial admitting this against direct orders general roberts. May I speak freely you may
[7751.86s -> 7757.46s]  No, how could I hope to hold down my command if I didn't believe in what I saw and said no
[7758.10s -> 7760.80s]  Why are you talking?
[7760.80s -> 7762.45s]  I
[7762.45s -> 7772.68s]  Like you colonel here. Would you like an apple? There are flying saucers. There's no doubt. They are in our skies
[7773.00s -> 7779.19s]  I've been there for some time. What are we going to do about them? Who knows then?
[7779.83s -> 7787.57s]  They really are there by the two phones. I thought you were convinced of that. I am we've had contact. Why are there two phones?
[7787.89s -> 7789.25s]  contact
[7789.25s -> 7793.32s]  Radio they speak our language. Well, one's a cell phone
[7793.88s -> 7797.00s]  We received messages from their spaceships for a while
[7797.08s -> 7799.64s]  It came in as just a lot of jumbled noise
[7800.12s -> 7805.16s]  I don't want my wife to know who i'm calling on my second line tried contact with us by radio
[7805.32s -> 7811.51s]  We've developed a language computer a machine that breaks down any language. See I sell drugs too
[7811.67s -> 7815.11s]  You've seen that movie that tv show with brian cranson
[7815.67s -> 7819.54s]  You've been in charge of saucer field activity for a long while
[7819.78s -> 7824.74s]  I think it's about time you heard these recordings you mind mind
[7825.70s -> 7836.07s]  I'm anxious. He's a two-star general. So he has two phones. God damn it
[7836.71s -> 7855.46s]  From a planet of your galaxy. I fully realize or as you want the language so you can now understand since the beginning of your time
[7855.86s -> 7857.86s]  We have been far beyond your planet
[7858.26s -> 7864.34s]  It has taken you centuries to even grasp what we developed eons of your years ago. We're flex, dude
[7864.92s -> 7871.73s]  Do you still believe it impossible we exist you didn't actually think you were the only inhabited planet in the universe
[7872.74s -> 7877.19s]  How can any race be so stupid permit me to set your mind at ease?
[7877.88s -> 7881.65s]  How can anybody be so stupid your planet only save it
[7883.11s -> 7888.96s]  We could have destroyed it long ago if that had been our aim our principal purpose is friendly
[7889.72s -> 7894.20s]  I admit we have had to take certain means which you might refer to as criminal
[7894.28s -> 7898.88s]  But that is the cause of your big guns which have destroyed some of our representative
[7900.40s -> 7907.24s]  If you persist in denying us our landlands, then we must only accept that you do not want us on friendly terms
[7908.88s -> 7911.28s]  We then have no alternative but to destroy you
[7911.92s -> 7916.64s]  Before you destroy us with your ancient juvenile minds
[7917.20s -> 7921.52s]  You have developed explosives too fast for your mind to perceive what you were doing
[7921.60s -> 7927.44s]  This really is la noir the verge of destroying the entire we are a part of that
[7928.72s -> 7940.28s]  This is our last that's the end of that one atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting
[7940.77s -> 7944.37s]  How many of these recordings do you have general and even dozen up to now?
[7944.53s -> 7948.45s]  This was the last one we received it over a month ago. Do you think they mean business?
[7948.77s -> 7953.24s]  We can't afford to take any chances come over here. Thank you language computer
[7955.41s -> 7958.69s]  You ever been to hollywood? Oh a couple of times a few years ago
[7959.01s -> 7961.51s]  You're going to be there in the morning
[7961.51s -> 7964.63s]  Just a few minutes from hollywood in the town of san fernando
[7965.76s -> 7971.44s]  Reports have come in of saucers flying so low the exhaust knocked people to the ground
[7972.10s -> 7975.86s]  There have even been stated claims of saucer landings. What is that on the left?
[7976.68s -> 7979.64s]  Is that an x-ray of his abdomen while you're out there by the way?
[7979.72s -> 7984.52s]  What do you think about these man for the job of attempting to contact them find them colonel?
[7985.08s -> 7989.16s]  See what in hell it is. They want all right, sir. I'd be concerned
[7990.12s -> 7998.05s]  These are confidential reports colonel read them over carefully on the plane
[7998.61s -> 8006.47s]  Turn them over to intelligence when you get to los angeles. They'll have further orders for disposition. Yes, sir. Here's my laptop
[8008.72s -> 8011.38s]  Yes, sir. Good luck. Thank you, sir
[8017.38s -> 8019.38s]  Here's my luck god damn it
[8028.58s -> 8033.96s]  Aliens stands up straight and they do weird things. We stand up straight. That's how you know
[8033.96s -> 8044.04s]  We're fucking aliens because we have good posture. We are ready your excellency. You are many days late
[8044.36s -> 8051.59s]  It was unavoidable. We tried to transmit via televisor, but atmospheric conditions made transmission impossible
[8051.67s -> 8056.00s]  You should have transmitted as soon as conditions permitted. I thought time was of the essence
[8056.78s -> 8060.88s]  Suspicion has fallen upon our movements our ships have been viewed near the point of operations
[8061.99s -> 8067.59s]  And what has this added time gained euros? What does even axe we have successfully risen three of the dead ones
[8067.67s -> 8071.75s]  Why is that his family crest they have axes in space bring in the big one
[8072.42s -> 8084.02s]  Use your small electrode gun. I have taken two ships from your command that will leave only my ship
[8084.34s -> 8091.67s]  It is necessary that you continue your mission alone. I have need of your other ships elsewhere
[8092.45s -> 8098.23s]  Even though you have risen three of the earth dead the plan is far from successful
[8098.69s -> 8107.57s]  And you euros must prove it an operational success before more time energy ships and your countrymen may be spent on it
[8108.88s -> 8112.07s]  No, no aliens have died. Everything is on our side
[8112.71s -> 8116.64s]  Not everything you do not have the live earth people
[8119.80s -> 8121.56s]  line
[8121.56s -> 8126.84s]  You reported that your ship was viewed at the scene of your present operations. That is correct
[8128.15s -> 8136.71s]  They have been viewed many times but not at the scene of operations something must be done about that. I want this guy to talk
[8139.03s -> 8145.99s]  Stop him turner. He's close enough turn off your electrode gun. No
[8145.99s -> 8148.48s]  No
[8161.22s -> 8163.22s]  That's a nintendo light gun
[8163.94s -> 8166.44s]  That was too close
[8166.44s -> 8171.92s]  Yes
[8171.92s -> 8183.80s]  Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him. What is he doing to him?
[8184.04s -> 8190.02s]  He's giving him acupuncture. I don't understand what this is supposed to do. Yes. She's a fine specimen
[8190.34s -> 8195.04s]  Are they all this powerful on planet earth? This one is an exception excellency
[8195.86s -> 8199.38s]  What are the other two like one is a woman the other an old man
[8207.56s -> 8212.64s]  This gives me a plan put the big one away pick up your electrode gun
[8213.12s -> 8215.12s]  Make sure it's in working order before pointing it at him
[8217.88s -> 8221.32s]  And make sure the two tracking devices can see you in vr god damn it
[8221.32s -> 8234.53s]  How do you not know this by now mary the old one must be sacrificed?
[8235.57s -> 8240.50s]  We land on earth send the old one do what we do
[8240.90s -> 8245.70s]  Tape two to your legs then cut the electrokinetic and turn on your ship's decomposure ray
[8246.53s -> 8253.20s]  The result will astound those watching astound them enough to delay their intention until you have
[8253.76s -> 8262.08s]  Gained your other recruits from the cemetery. Yes, excellency. It'll be done report to me when this has been accomplished
[8270.34s -> 8277.99s]  Hear us the earth people are getting closer to that which we fear since they will not listen or respect our existence
[8278.39s -> 8282.39s]  They cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking around again
[8282.87s -> 8287.83s]  Brought about by our advancement and such things as soon as you have enough for the dead recruits
[8288.31s -> 8291.59s]  March them on the capitals of the earth. Let nothing stand in your way
[8292.31s -> 8297.43s]  I thought they were blurring his crest out to make them accept our existence like they didn't want to get sued by mcdonald's or something
[8304.85s -> 8306.85s]  He's just reading
[8333.64s -> 8335.64s]  Cemetery again
[8336.60s -> 8339.92s]  I have four sets in this whole movie
[8340.74s -> 8344.98s]  Cemetery backyard. This is colonel edwards from washington dc spaceship god damn
[8346.02s -> 8354.29s]  Colonel would like to ask a few questions questions. What about colonel? May I uh sit down? Oh, i'm sorry
[8354.37s -> 8360.58s]  Please do I want to ask you about your strange experience the other night when you saw the flying saucer. That's uncomfortable
[8363.04s -> 8367.38s]  After that the police brought me home
[8367.46s -> 8371.36s]  I hope I never see such a sight again. Well after your description
[8371.36s -> 8376.69s]  I don't think i'd want to see it either one thing more after you were forced to the ground
[8376.77s -> 8380.85s]  But that blast of wind was it a hot or cold Coca-Cola coke Coca-Cola
[8381.25s -> 8389.08s]  It's kind of hard to explain wasn't hot wasn't cold. It's just a terrific force. We we couldn't get off the ground
[8389.97s -> 8391.97s]  The light blinded me so badly
[8391.97s -> 8393.41s]  I couldn't see a thing
[8393.41s -> 8396.96s]  We could only feel the pressure of the wind until it was gone
[8398.18s -> 8404.74s]  When the glare left us we could see a glowing ball disappearing off in the distance which way toward the cemetery
[8406.39s -> 8408.82s]  Oh here they come
[8409.06s -> 8417.44s]  Have we seen this guy's face one time? Oh, yeah. Yeah, right right. Yeah here we have
[8421.25s -> 8426.24s]  This is the most fantastic story i've ever heard and every word of it's true, too
[8426.72s -> 8429.48s]  That's the fantastic part of it colonel
[8430.12s -> 8434.05s]  We found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery then again
[8435.06s -> 8437.06s]  They got mileage out of that one
[8461.20s -> 8463.20s]  Lieutenant turn the car off
[8466.92s -> 8484.80s]  Does he get zapped? Please zap him please
[8485.92s -> 8502.20s]  Why do they always when the car and close the door roll the windows up he can't get in
[8503.24s -> 8505.24s]  This guy has no fucking powers
[8505.96s -> 8530.00s]  He's just a little odd
[8530.00s -> 8536.15s]  Why are you standing still run maybe run the fuck away
[8537.43s -> 8556.20s]  This guy has the same emotion the whole scene
[8556.84s -> 8563.41s]  What do you make of that? She caught me didn't look that way a minute ago. What about your man?
[8563.65s -> 8576.44s]  Oh, did you say when I forgot all about kelton? Uh, he'll be all right in a few minutes. How do you know?
[8576.84s -> 8581.64s]  Did you see that thing? Did you get it? We got it. What was it?
[8582.28s -> 8586.28s]  It didn't fall. I fired every bullet I had so no you got him
[8586.44s -> 8589.44s]  You got him
[8595.04s -> 8605.48s]  Five-year-old
[8608.20s -> 8610.20s]  Back to the cemetery, yeah
[8617.19s -> 8619.53s]  I thought he was gonna go to smoke his cigarette
[8621.03s -> 8625.96s]  Like oh let me take a drag it's my turn
[8630.84s -> 8635.60s]  Yes, sir stay with mrs. Trent. All right lieutenant. I used to close to the officer, honey
[8635.76s -> 8640.55s]  I'd feel safer with you. Oh, yeah, there's there's still two enemies remaining
[8654.37s -> 8660.98s]  You have a gun. You know how to use one to four years in the marine corps
[8664.84s -> 8670.28s]  What just say yeah, what tell let's get going where's his did he just give him his gun
[8671.17s -> 8676.21s]  Yeah, I want you to be responsible for shooting the lady. Not me. I was here but I didn't do it
[8677.17s -> 8691.16s]  What you take it you fire would expect to find out here. Yeah, there's only one answer. Trent
[8691.40s -> 8696.88s]  We'll know when we find inspector clay is great right over here. Is that the one yeah guns?
[8696.96s -> 8706.12s]  Don't do anything. Why are they still firing?
[8706.20s -> 8711.73s]  Just pick up a fucking tombstone and hit her in the face
[8717.12s -> 8723.41s]  This is to me like someone that's broken off instead of in i'm surviving during the zombie apocalypse guys
[8726.68s -> 8731.36s]  Some things just can't happen. Yeah. Well after that apparition that was draped across mr
[8731.36s -> 8737.56s]  Trent's patio, I would say we should keep our minds open to anything. Look colonel. I'm a policeman
[8737.72s -> 8743.46s]  I've got the deal in facts. I guess i'll have to go along with you
[8744.28s -> 8748.29s]  You know, i'll pet my badge right now. We haven't seen the last of those weirdies
[8753.36s -> 8758.04s]  They'll discover our ship soon. You're going to let them find us. It's the only way
[8758.52s -> 8761.00s]  These are the same men who have been so close so often
[8761.40s -> 8765.28s]  They must be halted before they can inform others about us, but there were others in the car
[8765.28s -> 8772.44s]  This is a painted garage. That's a garage the big one for the girl and the policeman
[8772.60s -> 8782.04s]  I'll turn on the digital robotaries and burst them. Yep. That's the door going into your house from your garage
[8783.00s -> 8790.42s]  Look at the floor. The whole movie is a garage
[8790.90s -> 8802.63s]  Oh shit, you're right. No, it's a real spaceship
[8809.67s -> 8816.31s]  One thing a policeman learns. Mr. Trent is patience. Where's that burn spot you mentioned right over there. I'm gonna piss my pants
[8816.79s -> 8836.24s]  Oh, we got a long way to go. We'll investigate but move carefully. All right, i'm gonna i'm gonna pee
[8836.24s -> 8844.26s]  I'm gonna i'm gonna piss my pants. I'll be right back interlude. We got 20 minutes left of the movie interlude
[8844.58s -> 9191.28s]  Go to the lobby. Well, get back in here. Hurry up. Get in here the projectionist the project the
[9193.09s -> 9204.85s]  Projectionist it's a hard word to say back to the movie. I scared you. I'm sorry. That's a heart. No, no
[9204.85s -> 9208.77s]  No, that's that has nothing to do with the amount of drinks. I've had that's a hard word to say
[9210.53s -> 9235.03s]  Projectionist projectionist. It's difficult. No, I've had two drinks. Relax. Here we go. I got behind you turn around
[9235.67s -> 9237.67s]  Why she's sleeping in the car?
[9240.95s -> 9260.79s]  The equivalent of wiping his cheeto hands on his sleeves that doesn't do very much damage
[9265.92s -> 9269.12s]  And you will be the first live earth people the car was
[9270.24s -> 9272.24s]  a celestial ship
[9272.56s -> 9275.68s]  That's a fucking hand dryer from the bathroom
[9282.20s -> 9286.20s]  What do you see only my reflection must be some kind of one-way glass
[9286.52s -> 9290.71s]  I wonder how you get into this thing. I'm not sure I want to find out
[9296.18s -> 9298.42s]  Humans have made it on board the garage
[9301.38s -> 9306.66s]  They've stepped over the water heater and avoided the cardboard boxes from the move we did three years ago
[9310.68s -> 9326.28s]  You can open the outer they've just crossed the power washer. We've never used though. We bought truly truly saying we were going to use it
[9326.68s -> 9336.95s]  These things speed around we might just get in then off it goes. That's a chance we take
[9337.27s -> 9343.09s]  Well, I took a chance on those earlier airplanes might just as well see what the inside one of these looks like
[9343.57s -> 9347.17s]  Got your guns ready. I'll tell you one thing a little green man pops out of me
[9347.25s -> 9350.21s]  I'm shooting first and asking questions. Oh, don't worry because they're humans
[9350.85s -> 9352.85s]  You'll be shooting other humans
[9353.41s -> 9368.36s]  Can you sleep at night after that one jack do we have to kill them? Yes
[9370.24s -> 9372.24s]  It seems such a waste
[9372.64s -> 9378.08s]  Well, wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than with their meddling permit them to destroy the entire universe
[9380.00s -> 9382.00s]  We're always right arrows. Of course
[9382.80s -> 9384.64s]  But those are not my words
[9384.64s -> 9386.64s]  Those are the words of the ruler
[9387.28s -> 9389.78s]  Who is that?
[9395.92s -> 9397.92s]  You're not so different you and I
[9398.77s -> 9401.73s]  Really the only difference is you got your outfit from party city
[9402.61s -> 9407.49s]  And I wear a suit to work. No for the moment. Who's the real weirdo do as I tell you
[9415.41s -> 9418.05s]  You do not need guns. Maybe we think we do
[9419.30s -> 9424.02s]  They would be of no use to you now. They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood
[9424.58s -> 9426.82s]  And you two look like you've got a lot of both
[9429.92s -> 9432.48s]  True, they would be effective upon us through
[9432.96s -> 9440.08s]  That's true the opportunity to use them mister if you don't get away from that control board i'll show you just how effective
[9441.60s -> 9446.28s]  Shall we talk now? All right
[9446.60s -> 9448.60s]  Your friends will be here shortly
[9450.20s -> 9457.25s]  Those you left at the vehicle if you've done anything to paul. Take it easy. Mr. Trent. Oh, I assure you no harm has come to her
[9458.05s -> 9460.48s]  Would you like to see?
[9462.24s -> 9466.08s]  Next time you try that I won't aim at the board. You're a headstrong young man
[9466.96s -> 9474.72s]  I was a cure for every illness in america see her movements. What are you stupid? Go ahead my friend
[9475.28s -> 9484.04s]  But move very carefully only in america apparently
[9492.02s -> 9495.67s]  She's only fainted you fiend
[9496.93s -> 9504.05s]  I a fiend. Um, hold on a second. What's going on with his grip on this gun?
[9504.13s -> 9508.93s]  He's this this grip on this gun is like trying to get into the claw of a lobster at red lobster
[9510.77s -> 9512.85s]  Like dude, what is this grip?
[9523.62s -> 9526.69s]  She's only fainted
[9527.09s -> 9529.09s]  His hands going I
[9530.00s -> 9531.28s]  a fiend
[9531.28s -> 9541.64s]  I feel like that's his hands were made in dreams. I fiend we did not come here as enemies
[9542.34s -> 9548.58s]  We came only with friendly intentions to talk to ask your aid our aid
[9549.43s -> 9556.98s]  Yes, your aid for the whole universe, but your governments of earth refused even to accept our existence
[9557.89s -> 9563.11s]  Even though you've seen us heard our messages you still refuse to accept us
[9564.12s -> 9572.50s]  Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our earth because of death because all you of earth are idiots
[9573.49s -> 9581.89s]  Do you just hold on buster? No, you hold on first was your firecracker a harmless explosive then your hand grenade
[9582.55s -> 9589.32s]  They began to kill your own people a few at a time then the bomb then a larger bomb
[9589.81s -> 9598.74s]  Many people are killed at one time then your scientist stumbled upon the atom bomb split the atom a larger bomb
[9598.98s -> 9600.50s]  Then the hydrogen bomb
[9600.50s -> 9607.91s]  Where you actually explode the air itself now brings the total destruction of the entire universe
[9608.55s -> 9618.76s]  Served by our sun the only explosion left is the solar night why there's no such thing perhaps to you
[9619.08s -> 9624.82s]  But we've known it for centuries your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others
[9625.14s -> 9631.86s]  But the juvenile lines which you possess will not comprehend its strength until it's too late
[9633.43s -> 9641.54s]  You're way above our heads the solar night is a way to explode the actual particles of sunlight why that's impossible
[9642.36s -> 9646.04s]  Even now your scientists are working on a way to harness the sun's rays
[9647.20s -> 9649.44s]  The rays of sunlight are minute particles
[9650.08s -> 9651.92s]  Is it so far from your imagination?
[9651.92s -> 9656.32s]  They cannot do as I have suggested why a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured
[9657.06s -> 9664.10s]  Can you see or measure an atom? Yes, you can explode one a ray of sunlight is made up of many atoms
[9664.26s -> 9671.67s]  So, what if we do develop this solar night bomb we'd be even a stronger nation than now stronger you see you see
[9672.07s -> 9677.67s]  Your stupid minds stupid stupid. That's all i'm taking from you. Get back here you jack
[9679.67s -> 9688.13s]  Let him finish he turns green. He's an alien. He was just projecting different skin
[9688.21s -> 9693.49s]  It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed headstrong violent
[9694.39s -> 9699.38s]  No use of the mind god gave you you talk of god his red blood
[9700.10s -> 9707.38s]  You also think it impossible that we too might think of god you guys celebrate easter you
[9708.16s -> 9715.57s]  I do wear the uniform of your country. You see I wear the uniform of my country. Yes
[9716.44s -> 9720.76s]  We've had to use drastic eggs and the bunny and shit, but you left us no alternative
[9722.04s -> 9732.10s]  When you have the solar night you have nothing nor does the universe you speak of solar range country
[9732.34s -> 9737.48s]  What is it take a can of your gasoline say?
[9738.50s -> 9747.22s]  This can of gasoline is the sun now you spread a thin line of it to a ball representing the earth
[9748.28s -> 9754.12s]  Now the gasoline represents the sunlight the sun particles here
[9754.20s -> 9760.05s]  We saturate the ball with the gasoline the sunlight then we put a flame to the ball
[9761.19s -> 9766.23s]  The flame will speedily travel around the earth back along the line of gasoline to the can
[9766.79s -> 9773.75s]  Or the sun itself just like that gta 5 it will explode this source you play that trevor mission spread to every place that gasoline
[9773.83s -> 9781.60s]  Like that sunlight touches explode the sunlight here gentlemen you explode the universe
[9783.24s -> 9786.76s]  Explode the sunlight here and a chain reaction will occur
[9787.32s -> 9795.62s]  Direct to the sun itself true and to all the planets that sunlight touches to every planet in the universe
[9797.57s -> 9800.07s]  This is why you must be stopped
[9800.15s -> 9807.91s]  This is why any means must be used to stop you in a friendly manner or as it seems
[9808.98s -> 9810.98s]  You want this is a v-sauce video
[9812.08s -> 9817.12s]  Mad is it mad that you destroy other people to save yourselves you have done this
[9817.96s -> 9821.32s]  Is it mad that one country must destroy another to save themselves?
[9821.94s -> 9828.29s]  You have also done this how then is it mad that one planet must destroy another who threatens the very
[9830.02s -> 9835.38s]  She's just saying the same shit you were what in my land women are for advancing the race
[9835.86s -> 9840.85s]  Not for fighting man's battle. Well in our land gas is worthless right now
[9840.85s -> 9845.25s]  So your analogy doesn't make any fucking sense clued is worth like negative 30 dollars bro
[9846.21s -> 9863.33s]  Is for the development of our planet back to the graveyard. We always end up here
[9867.09s -> 9869.09s]  What happened to you? How come you're all alone?
[9869.41s -> 9874.32s]  I asked for lots of help you sounded drunk or something on the radio. I didn't see with my own eyes
[9874.40s -> 9879.49s]  I'd never believe it believe what it was horrible and he almost broke my shoulder
[9879.89s -> 9884.29s]  Look, what are you trying to say? If you don't make sense, we'll never get to the bottom of this now. Who slugged you?
[9884.61s -> 9891.30s]  Inspector clay what it was clay. All right, only not like we remembered him
[9892.61s -> 9898.72s]  Well, his leg was busted into I can't even text you tell me you saw skeletons. We did earlier
[9899.64s -> 9905.92s]  Now I know you're off your rocker. All of us saw it lieutenant the colonel everybody. Where's lieutenant now?
[9906.63s -> 9910.31s]  We've got to find him. Mr. Trenor's gone. I was left here to guard her
[9910.79s -> 9916.16s]  But they showed up and put me out of the running and the second time tonight and i'm getting darn tired of it
[9916.32s -> 9921.35s]  Which way were they going off that way? Come on. I don't know. I'm a police officer in every movie
[9921.43s -> 9933.32s]  I don't know anything then one day it could all be gone one big puff of smoke and ball of fire
[9935.25s -> 9937.68s]  All that out there the stars
[9938.56s -> 9940.64s]  the planets
[9940.64s -> 9942.64s]  All of just an empty void
[9943.68s -> 9949.01s]  You two had better come along with us come with you. We're gonna arrest an alien police station
[9949.65s -> 9952.85s]  Ha ha ha ha ha
[9952.85s -> 9968.93s]  So it seems you think you have the upper hand look out that window jeb jeb
[9970.10s -> 9972.10s]  Hey jeb come over here jeb
[9975.35s -> 9979.36s]  She is unarmed, but he would kill in seconds if I so choose
[9980.00s -> 9992.53s]  I feel like we've crossed this path before yes, we have holy cow. It's the only path in the movie
[9993.41s -> 9997.25s]  Same. Oh my god. I can't I can't even watch this anymore
[9998.44s -> 10005.80s]  Look there. It's clay. All right. There's no mistaking that
[10006.36s -> 10008.36s]  And he's got mrs. Trent
[10008.36s -> 10014.52s]  Get your gun ready from all i've seen tonight guns won't do any good clay is dead and we buried him
[10014.92s -> 10020.68s]  How are we going to kill somebody that's already dead dead and yet there he stands. Well, no, that doesn't make any sense
[10020.76s -> 10026.28s]  He hasn't laughed yet and ruined every skit. He's been in that's the only reason i'm listening to you
[10029.86s -> 10033.62s]  Look, i've got an idea heard him or not. We've got to try something
[10033.86s -> 10039.54s]  I'm gonna sneak up behind him and walk him over the head that ought to make a move follow me
[10040.18s -> 10042.66s]  Even when clay was alive, he couldn't run. He's over there somewhere
[10044.82s -> 10046.90s]  Run like lightning in the opposite direction
[10047.62s -> 10055.96s]  You think it'll work over anything else to try? Oh my god. This is gonna be so funny
[10055.96s -> 10057.96s]  He's gonna have the fucking head
[10060.60s -> 10071.36s]  I'll be all right
[10071.36s -> 10077.89s]  Why just gently tapping somebody's what your man told the big one was he dubbing her voice
[10078.21s -> 10083.41s]  Of anything else to try he was just dubbing her voice idea heard him or not
[10083.41s -> 10089.01s]  We've got to try something i'm gonna sneak up behind him and walk him over the head that ought to make a move
[10089.97s -> 10093.57s]  Follow me even when clay was alive. He couldn't run fast enough to catch me
[10093.81s -> 10101.09s]  It took him an hour and 13 minutes run like lightning hit somebody with a stick. You think it'll work of anything else to try
[10118.76s -> 10127.62s]  Oh, i'll be all right, take care of the others that's him doing her voice he's practicing
[10128.90s -> 10135.97s]  This could only happen because the electrode ray is off. He'll walk again when I turn it on all that right there
[10136.96s -> 10141.36s]  Suppose the lieutenant and the others are in that thing. Well, they're supposedly they're margins or something in there
[10143.43s -> 10153.84s]  Let's go
[10153.84s -> 10156.28s]  You're under arrest. We're gonna put you
[10157.16s -> 10160.16s]  Not really punching
[10162.13s -> 10164.13s]  Here's the gun
[10180.93s -> 10182.93s]  I'll have a ship in the air in a minute
[10188.84s -> 10197.72s]  What is he doing over there he doesn't know what that is jack stop doing that you're dropping the air pressure in the room
[10204.60s -> 10206.84s]  Get out of here jeff the ship's on fire
[10215.08s -> 10217.34s]  Get out of here jeff the ship's on fire
[10217.34s -> 10219.34s]  Look at the day
[10230.98s -> 10235.06s]  This is like we're talking about garages that's the electrical meter
[10236.17s -> 10241.61s]  That's like they just dog it up a little bit. That's the thing the guy comes to your house to see how much electricity you use
[10247.00s -> 10249.24s]  They added a couple of
[10249.24s -> 10252.07s]  dials to it
[10252.07s -> 10256.47s]  Get out of here man. The ship's on fire. Get out of the garage the garage is on fire
[10256.47s -> 10259.22s]  Yeah
[10262.39s -> 10265.19s]  For some reason we decided to turn our grill on in the garage
[10265.83s -> 10267.83s]  We're fucking idiots
[10269.11s -> 10271.19s]  You're supposed to use these things outside, man
[10277.48s -> 10278.76s]  Tapiano
[10278.76s -> 10283.11s]  They're supposed to use charcoal inside
[10283.75s -> 10298.94s]  Was it worth it? Was it worth it? I wonder if that's the last we'll see of that. I don't give a shit about your beyond burgers, mike
[10299.90s -> 10301.78s]  Yeah, gross
[10301.78s -> 10304.10s]  God damn it. You should have been safe. Oh, he's dead
[10308.17s -> 10310.12s]  That thing yet?
[10310.12s -> 10316.60s]  That's right. There's another ghoul running loose and it's my guess that you'll look like him with the ship and the ray gun gone
[10316.60s -> 10318.60s]  They have no control
[10319.94s -> 10321.94s]  We gotta hand it to them though. They
[10322.26s -> 10329.56s]  They're far ahead of us
[10336.44s -> 10338.44s]  Just open up
[10344.52s -> 10346.52s]  Can you prove that it didn't happen
[10347.46s -> 10349.59s]  Perhaps on your way home
[10349.59s -> 10355.99s]  Someone will pass you in the dark and you will never know it for they will be from outer space
[10357.37s -> 10364.09s]  Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment. We once laughed at the horseless carriage
[10364.89s -> 10366.25s]  the airplane
[10366.25s -> 10368.41s]  the telephone the electric light
[10369.03s -> 10370.49s]  vitamins radio
[10370.49s -> 10382.97s]  vitamins radios fiber truck now some of us laugh at outer space in the future
[10383.69s -> 10399.18s]  garage in hollywood, usa
[10399.50s -> 10406.18s]  It was that was fucking ridiculous
[10407.22s -> 10409.22s]  What a stupid movie
[10417.26s -> 10425.29s]  Those were two back to back those were those were great
[10426.62s -> 10428.62s]  Very much worth watching on stream
[10429.75s -> 10433.72s]  I wonder if the next one will hold up the next one could be
[10434.60s -> 10437.22s]  Not even close. I don't know
[10437.62s -> 10447.02s]  It's worth a shot though. Ah coming up next we have to close this out. This is the longest one
[10449.11s -> 10451.67s]  This is santa claus conquers the martians
[10453.46s -> 10456.42s]  Uh, this is the longest one. So this is an hour and 20 minutes
[10458.18s -> 10459.70s]  and
[10459.70s -> 10461.78s]  I don't uh
[10461.78s -> 10468.52s]  Another alien themed one. This is gonna be so fucking bad
[10469.24s -> 10471.24s]  This one sucks, dude
[10471.83s -> 10474.55s]  uh
[10474.55s -> 10484.07s]  Well, we're gonna watch it. It's very boring. Uh
[10489.62s -> 10499.27s]  How could you have a boring movie if you're santa claus conquering martians? Let's see what happens
[10499.35s -> 10509.03s]  I'm willing to give it a try. It's not what you think. It's terrible. It's terrible

[10539.14s -> 10542.70s]  Oh my god
[10542.70s -> 10544.50s]  Okay
[10544.50s -> 10550.62s]  So this is this is bad. Are you sure? Are you sure?

[10592.36s -> 10594.04s]  and the other one is
[10594.04s -> 10595.80s]  Attack of the giant leeches
[10595.80s -> 10599.58s]  Attack of the giant leeches is the one that's up next
[10599.98s -> 10609.75s]  That sounds better
[10610.55s -> 10616.25s]  But what about the santa claus one
[10618.79s -> 10621.83s]  Really? Uh leeches, please. Oh, right

[10628.55s -> 10633.37s]  With bombs or whatever. He does. I don't know santa conquers earth. No santa conquers the martians

[11693.10s -> 11695.10s]  It was an octopus
[11696.30s -> 11699.58s]  Oh, sir, and it weren't no freak gator neither
[11700.54s -> 11705.74s]  I've been poaching this country for 40 years and I ain't never seen nothing like it
[11706.38s -> 11711.26s]  Not too bad. You didn't bring it back steve benton probably pay a fair bounty for whatever it was
[11712.14s -> 11713.58s]  bounty
[11713.58s -> 11717.58s]  I wouldn't touch that critter for all the money ever made
[11718.22s -> 11720.38s]  And if you see that you wouldn't either
[11721.10s -> 11723.74s]  You better take it easy on this stuff. You're looking kind of peeking
[11724.62s -> 11729.82s]  What am I gonna get some real shit in the public domain? I'm gonna clean my otter. I think about this sometimes
[11731.42s -> 11734.14s]  Public domain always has just dog shit
[11734.54s -> 11738.70s]  You've been poaching all these years coming back to haunt you frankenstein's the only thing we got

[11764.44s -> 11766.44s]  Mickey mouse is gonna be selling insurance
[11767.90s -> 11770.14s]  Just wait when they lose that case in 10 years
[11771.46s -> 11773.46s]  You made that joke before he's a repeater
[11774.34s -> 11780.34s]  And here by the way, here comes the jazz music when uh, there's a lady on the screen and hold on. We might need to
[11782.36s -> 11786.60s]  I need to move this forward about 15 seconds. Look

[11822.33s -> 11835.53s]  All right, did you tell that there might be a female on the screen?
[11843.96s -> 11847.50s]  There could be a woman on the screen in 1940
[11848.06s -> 11862.49s]  Okay, this is might be a skip scenario touch me you think you're talking to don't touch me
[11862.73s -> 11866.25s]  You're my wife. I'll touch you anytime. I feel like it. They're married

[11887.23s -> 11889.95s]  Liz baby, I don't mean nothing listen to me
[11890.51s -> 11896.03s]  I know I know i've been really looking like chef boy rd lately, but you know, i'm good for it
[11896.11s -> 11904.68s]  You know me
[11916.40s -> 11922.40s]  What there was a young one that last trap had to kill it. Oh poor thing. What?
[11923.44s -> 11927.08s]  Told you you shouldn't come along
[11927.08s -> 11931.72s]  Turn the lights on. I can't see what's happening. This is the movie man watching a wedding dress
[11932.76s -> 11934.76s]  Oh when she's not suffering those traps
[11935.72s -> 11937.16s]  horrible
[11937.16s -> 11940.92s]  These poachers know the swamps like the back of their hands, but i'll catch one of them. Yeah
[11944.12s -> 11946.12s]  I'll have to be satisfied confiscating
[11947.72s -> 11949.72s]  Trap

[11956.60s -> 11962.60s]  Steve you're a stranger here. They've lived this way for generations one man isn't going to change them overnight
[11963.24s -> 11965.64s]  You're a real worry ward. I'm serious
[11966.76s -> 11968.36s]  They can be dangerous
[11968.36s -> 11970.36s]  Shut up you drunk. I'll be careful. What?
[11970.84s -> 11978.14s]  You just all right
[11978.86s -> 11982.83s]  Steve I love you. I love you so much
[11983.55s -> 12029.34s]  What was that
[12029.42s -> 12031.50s]  Was eating cereal listen benton
[12032.14s -> 12034.30s]  What is he eating that beef stew?
[12035.18s -> 12041.34s]  As far as this office is concerned at the end of but sure if I can't see whether lem was killed by anything human
[12041.42s -> 12043.42s]  I wouldn't need you to tell me my job
[12043.90s -> 12047.50s]  And i'm not about to go tromping through the swamp looking for an overgrown gator
[12048.22s -> 12055.82s]  Saw your wasn't killed by an alligator. Is that so did you hear that morton game warden benton says it wasn't a gator kill lem
[12056.70s -> 12057.90s]  Well, then what was it?
[12057.90s -> 12063.82s]  You know, you can't veto movie halfway through it. Dr. Grayson said it's been it's been like two hours
[12064.54s -> 12071.66s]  How has it been? Oh sure. How has it been 10 minutes? It's been three hours 30 miles inland living in clear water
[12072.22s -> 12074.54s]  Stranger things have happened. I know I care benton
[12075.18s -> 12077.18s]  You work for the state
[12077.34s -> 12081.42s]  Now, why don't you keep your nose out of county business? Is that clear enough for you? Oh, we're staying
[12082.60s -> 12084.60s]  Oh go soak your fat head
[12085.24s -> 12087.24s]  What
[12088.01s -> 12092.73s]  What was that you said oh go soak your fat head go soak your fat head
[12096.65s -> 12099.93s]  Okay, go soak your fat head trouble
[12100.97s -> 12102.97s]  And he's sure going to get it
[12103.13s -> 12105.20s]  You can bet on that
[12105.20s -> 12117.10s]  There's a good thing. He's 11. Otherwise, I would have been really mad at him. The octopi uses its suction discs to hold its prey
[12117.66s -> 12121.82s]  Now in itself the disc will not inflict a wound same is true of the squid
[12122.22s -> 12128.86s]  Now both creatures have a parrot-like beak as their primary offensive and defensive weapon. Well, maybe the sheriff was right there
[12130.91s -> 12133.57s]  Could be a freak or a malformed alligator
[12134.75s -> 12136.11s]  No
[12136.11s -> 12138.03s]  No, i'm afraid it wasn't
[12138.03s -> 12140.72s]  Well, where does that leave us doc?
[12141.04s -> 12143.53s]  I wish I knew
[12143.53s -> 12146.57s]  You know, i'm beginning to think lem was telling the truth in warper store
[12147.45s -> 12149.45s]  He did see something that night
[12150.01s -> 12153.85s]  Something that had intelligence enough to seek him out destroy him late. Thanks for the tea
[12154.17s -> 12158.57s]  Sorry, I'm going to have killed the thing this guy's jack a dozen rifle bullets. Look at this guy's fucking arms
[12158.65s -> 12162.49s]  I've seen that old 44 40 years. Nothing could live after being hit with those slugs
[12163.53s -> 12165.16s]  well
[12165.16s -> 12167.56s]  Conceiving the possibility of one such creature
[12168.36s -> 12170.84s]  We must also concede the possibility of others
[12172.78s -> 12177.18s]  Oh, there's one sure way of finding out go in and search every backwater channel and what's button this one if it's there i'll find it
[12210.40s -> 12225.04s]  Well, whatever it was it's not here anymore
[12226.48s -> 12231.44s]  Do you want some coffee? Yeah. Thanks, son. I know I could hide in here and never be noticed one did
[12232.40s -> 12237.52s]  The seminal was on osio in 1830s with the u.s army two years around them up. I remember reading about osio in high school two years
[12238.48s -> 12241.52s]  It's only been out of two days and I feel worn out. Well, I might as well keep on looking around
[12242.24s -> 12245.63s]  This movie's so bad
[12246.84s -> 12251.48s]  What do you want me to do? It's like this is the second movie we tried this is the second finale
[12252.36s -> 12263.37s]  This is finale two. I
[12264.41s -> 12274.62s]  Want more ritz brothers. I me too. I know I really do
[12287.36s -> 12292.16s]  Got an interesting scene. Hold on. Can't you think of anything else? Say stupid? I gotta get this order over miss chauvin
[12292.24s -> 12294.24s]  She's one of my better customers
[12294.56s -> 12296.16s]  Can't keep awaiting

[12325.13s -> 12328.81s]  And you know women cal gotta get the hair down every now and then
[12330.14s -> 12332.46s]  You sure don't know an awful lot about females

[12338.00s -> 12341.76s]  All I got is a few bags of rice a couple of shelves stable

[12347.68s -> 12350.56s]  I don't own anything else to sell out and move into town

[12627.58s -> 12727.02s]  Yeah
[12733.39s -> 12735.39s]  You call yourself a man
[12748.83s -> 12750.83s]  Get going
[12755.39s -> 12760.76s]  You wouldn't you wouldn't get an old friend dave if you don't move i'll tell you where you're staying
[12767.97s -> 12769.97s]  Why did he shoot him

[12821.30s -> 12825.39s]  Like what he's spamming
[12825.63s -> 12827.63s]  God drops to the floor
[12828.27s -> 12830.27s]  Eyes pop out of something
[12836.35s -> 12843.63s]  That's appeared next to head his steam blows out slams fist on table rattling any plates or bolts
[12846.77s -> 12848.77s]  Fireworks
[12849.81s -> 12851.81s]  There ain't nothing down here sir
[12853.73s -> 12855.73s]  Well i'm getting tired of this
[12855.89s -> 12868.98s]  Uh, come on in boys well if there's any bodies out there we'd have found them guys I want some straight answers walter
[12876.32s -> 12878.40s]  I want to see the leech. Oh my god. My head hurts
[12879.44s -> 12896.85s]  Come on out of there. All right. Yeah, stop stop. Stop. So I read it. I got it. I got it
[12897.41s -> 12913.47s]  What is it? I can't see it
[12916.69s -> 12919.33s]  Just one of the scaring them bodies are still in there
[12919.81s -> 12924.53s]  You can bet some old bull gators got him stuffed in his cave under the bank
[12925.17s -> 12929.97s]  Letting him ripen up for a few days. Oh my god. My head hurts from laughing. Yeah. Well
[12930.93s -> 12935.33s]  What was it leech some long cypress poles to go man pulled the gator cave
[12940.53s -> 12944.05s]  Too far forward how what
[12944.37s -> 12951.20s]  It's about two seconds
[12951.20s -> 12953.20s]  I'm sorry doc. I can't do it
[12953.28s -> 12956.64s]  Wait, who's dead? I had to do it myself wouldn't want to have to arrest you doc
[12956.64s -> 12960.96s]  But I will if I find you near the preserve with any explosives. Why is he 5 000 feet away?
[12961.04s -> 12963.04s]  Sorry, nan. That's the way it's got to be
[12963.44s -> 12966.32s]  He's right, man. It's his job to protect wildlife
[12966.88s -> 12968.88s]  What about he's two miles away?
[12969.44s -> 12971.60s]  Three people have been killed in that game preserve
[12972.00s -> 12973.60s]  Doesn't that mean anything to you?
[12973.60s -> 12980.24s]  Nan try to understand if I could be sure something in the swamp was responsible for those deaths. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
[12980.96s -> 12985.12s]  We've been together the last three days was hanging a trace of anything unusual
[12986.00s -> 12989.36s]  Not so much as a suggestion of any form of life unknown to us
[12990.00s -> 12991.20s]  steve
[12991.20s -> 12995.76s]  Shot and killed those people. All right. I'll admit for your death left a lot of questions unanswered
[12996.40s -> 12999.92s]  But you can bet your bottom dollar the other two died from dave walker's shotgun
[13000.40s -> 13006.56s]  Do you really believe that figure it out psycho walker the cartoon noises that came out of his gun swamps after he found him
[13006.56s -> 13010.56s]  How could you trust him after that? He shot them and he tried to place the blame on sawyer's dt's
[13011.28s -> 13016.40s]  If sawyer told of seeing a purple giraffes with polka dot tails walker would have claimed they did it
[13017.20s -> 13019.20s]  There's one argument against that steve
[13019.60s -> 13023.60s]  Dave walker wasn't the kind of a man to hang himself. Not even with two murder charges against him
[13024.16s -> 13026.88s]  I talked with dave less than an hour before he killed himself
[13027.52s -> 13031.76s]  That man best part of this movie was the dick rubbin name. I've seen frightened men before terrified men
[13031.92s -> 13036.08s]  Yeah, i've never seen anything to compare with the horror and the fear in walker's eyes
[13037.01s -> 13040.13s]  Well, he realized what he'd done and killed two people. That's the highlight
[13041.38s -> 13046.18s]  Oh look doc nan and I were all over that swamp god damn it. Why didn't these monsters attack us?
[13046.50s -> 13049.47s]  I've been thinking about that. They're probably night creatures
[13049.79s -> 13052.51s]  They can't stand the light they stay down near the bottom during the day
[13053.86s -> 13063.57s]  A small charge would stun him bring him to the surface can't buy doc. You're pigheaded steve benton stubborn and pigheaded

[16164.77s -> 16170.14s]  That's not a lie. That's real.
[16171.78s -> 16177.68s]  He's fudging the numbers. I'll be back on Monday. That's two days from now and I think it's gonna be hilarious.
[16180.38s -> 16185.28s]  Four out of 20 days? What? What is this?
[16188.69s -> 16191.12s]  Oh, that's public domain movie night. That's what we just did.
[16200.91s -> 16203.63s]  He's drunk? I... yeah, I kind of am.
[16204.27s -> 16207.42s]  What do you want me to lie to you?

[16526.24s -> 16531.07s]  For more fucking funny stuff. We're gonna play Gotcha Force.
[16531.71s -> 16533.95s]  One of my favorite GameCube games ever.
[16534.96s -> 16539.95s]  You'll see why. It was two hundred and fifty dollars. Gotcha Force was
[16540.11s -> 16545.39s]  two hundred and fifty fucking dollars. I hope you like it.

[16583.02s -> 16596.14s]  Thanks for all you do. Hopefully you recover really soon. Take care of yourself. Drink lots of water and stay isolated.
[16598.80s -> 16605.66s]  Thanks for the three dollars. Hey, Vic for First Noble. Thanks for five dollars.
[16606.90s -> 16609.94s]  If the gorilla is so smart, how come it's a gorilla and not a human?
[16612.34s -> 16621.34s]  Because the movie was made in 1939. They didn't fucking understand anything. They knew smoke cigarettes and break walls.
[16621.66s -> 16627.01s]  That's what they did. Hey, Banjo Boy. Thanks for two fifty. Fun fact.
[16627.98s -> 16633.42s]  Santa Claus Conquers the Martians was the first appearance of Mrs. Claus in any media.
[16634.64s -> 16641.09s]  Really? Most people think that the claymation Rudolph holds this title, but no.
[16641.57s -> 16647.31s]  Santa Claus Conquers the Martians came out a couple months before. I've watched this movie like 18 times.
[16647.79s -> 16655.52s]  I have no idea why. It was fun watching with you though. Thanks for a fun night. We barely watched it, but.
[16658.56s -> 16663.90s]  Atlanteus, thanks for ten dollars. Here are your royalties for my use of the Rat Birthday song

[16679.42s -> 16685.12s]  Hey freak out. Thanks for the five dollars. Jerma, if you want some old dramatic movies,
[16685.12s -> 16689.47s]  you should watch Twelve Angry Men for the best years of our lives.
[16689.87s -> 16695.82s]  Or if you want something to watch in your personal time, watch a thing that could be porn.
[16696.22s -> 16706.69s]  And I'm not going to say it out loud. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey, uh, Uber Morph Point.
[16706.85s -> 16714.99s]  Thanks for fifteen dollars, Uber Morph Point. If you do another one of these, you should watch Who Killed Captain Alex?
[16715.31s -> 16722.61s]  I've seen it. Uh, Ugandan Action Movie Free on YouTube. I've seen that whole movie. It's fantastic.
[16722.85s -> 16734.66s]  I'd like to see things on movie night that I've never seen. Things that I've never seen before. I've seen that one.
[16739.62s -> 16746.32s]  Uh, Dr. Zutsu, thanks for the seven dollars. Hey Jerma, glad this stream schedule is coming back together.
[16746.56s -> 16752.06s]  Stuff is really wild and stressful for everyone right now, and I'm glad stuff is working out for you enough
[16752.54s -> 16757.06s]  that you can stream again. I've been stressed recently since I started school again.
[16757.06s -> 16766.05s]  I can't believe I played Jump King for ten seconds and deleted the whole save. That's, that sucks.
[16766.93s -> 16774.16s]  Um, since I started school again and my design is one of the 25 finalists in the Terraria Vanity Contest,
[16775.84s -> 16780.64s]  if I win and you ever play Terraria again, my design is the TV head outfit.
[16781.52s -> 16791.33s]  Thanks for streaming. Thanks for the seven bucks. Terraria is a great game. That'd be fucking cool
[16791.33s -> 16796.11s]  if you got some shit in it. Can't believe I deleted my whole save account on Jump King.
[16796.35s -> 16805.63s]  Thanks for the seven bucks. Peaceful Haley, 250 from Peaceful Haley. So happy you're doing a movie night.
[16805.63s -> 16810.03s]  The riffing makes it even better. Thanks for being entertaining. Good night, Jerma, and chat.
[16811.97s -> 16817.82s]  Uh, I think it was a success. I had a lot of fun. I'm having a great time. Like, this has been fucking,
[16817.82s -> 16819.34s]  this has been a blast. I hope you had fun.
[16825.63s -> 16835.44s]  Thanks for the 350. Bella Lisosy was a master theater and movie actor in the 20s and early 30s,
[16835.44s -> 16841.38s]  and extremely popular thanks to his role in Dracula. The Gorilla was filmed in the period
[16841.38s -> 16848.77s]  when his career was on the decline and was mostly typecasted and relegated to bit parts.
[16848.77s -> 16858.00s]  By the time Plan 9 was filmed, he was destitute and addicted to morphine. Holy shit. He died
[16858.00s -> 16867.68s]  halfway through production. By the way, this was fun. Wait, what? He died halfway through production.
[16867.68s -> 16880.32s]  That's fucking horrible. Uh, also, I might suggest Freaks. 1932. That's sad and terrible.
[16880.32s -> 16886.88s]  That was the guy that used the cape? Oh, I fucking made fun of, that was, oh, I feel bad.
[16886.88s -> 16901.18s]  That's why they covered his face. Uh, thanks for the 250, Vrimthral. The Bella with the cape
[16901.18s -> 16906.93s]  up against his face is actually a double. Uh, Bella Lisosy died partway through into
[16906.93s -> 16912.88s]  filming Plan 9. Plan 9 was also Lisosy's final film. On a lighter note,
[16912.88s -> 16917.89s]  this whole stream has been golden. Thanks for the laughs. I'm glad we can come together and
[16917.89s -> 16923.30s]  have some fun. I had a few drinks. It's all, it's all good. You know, whatever. I played
[16923.30s -> 16929.41s]  Jump King to lead in my save. Embarrassing. What an embarrassing asshole. Uh, Fancy Boots. Thanks for
[16929.41s -> 16940.72s]  250. Correction. Plan 9 was technically, technically, Lisosy's final film. It was
[16940.72s -> 16948.82s]  released in 1959, but his appearance is comprised of old footage recorded before his passing.
[16948.82s -> 16965.71s]  Interesting tip. You're a movie nerd. Uh, Blaine. Blaine's Magmar. Thanks for 250. Uh,
[16965.71s -> 16969.31s]  Jerma, as a public health major, I want to say that you were doing a great service
[16969.31s -> 16975.57s]  just by making the quarantine more fun. You'll always be my favorite streamer. He has no idea
[16975.57s -> 16981.87s]  what the fuck he's saying. What? Yes, I do. I'm not like that far gone. Jesus. Give me some slack.
[16981.87s -> 16987.54s]  I've had some drinks. That doesn't mean I'm like fucking stupid. Oh, he's gone. He's,
[16987.54s -> 16996.37s]  he didn't have any idea what he's saying. Where is he? He's five. He's a five-year-old.
[16996.37s -> 17004.29s]  Give me some slack for Christ's sake. It's been like five hours of drinking. Eh, whatever. Hey,
[17004.29s -> 17012.90s]  DarkPyLord. Thanks for the five dollars. Jerma, fun fact about Plan 9 from Outer Space. Every
[17012.90s -> 17019.92s]  shot featuring Bella Lugosi was actually unused footage from a different movie Ed Wood had shot
[17019.92s -> 17055.22s]  years earlier. That's sad. So much Lugosi lore. I know. I'm laughing at that. No, I'm not. I'm
[17055.22s -> 17068.70s]  not laughing at some person. Hmm. Devakity, thanks for 250. In case you didn't know,
[17068.70s -> 17076.22s]  the backstory of Plan 9. Bella Lugosi that played the vampire was dead years before the movie.
[17076.22s -> 17100.54s]  I know the guy's dead. Okay. I get it. I know. He covered his face because after the actor wasn't
[17100.54s -> 17112.29s]  Lugosi, the footage where you see his face is leftover footage. I'm not laughing at that. I'm
[17112.29s -> 17119.65s]  laughing at chat being fucking hilarious. Ah, yeah. Bella Lugosi's dead. I know. I, this is like six
[17119.65s -> 17135.82s]  messages in a row. I know he's dead. I know. And then he was replaced. Please do The Great
[17135.82s -> 17148.35s]  Dictator. Pretty sure it's public domain. It's great. Thank you, Devakity. Oh, okay. I got to
[17148.35s -> 17153.15s]  fucking get it together. Hole of one zombie. Thanks for 250. This was amazing. Recommend.
[17157.57s -> 17164.37s]  I recommend any early Jackie Chan film in public domain or Ninja Dragon if it's on YouTube.
[17164.45s -> 17169.58s]  Not sure if it's public domain. Terribly dubbed Jackie Chan films are brilliant.
[17169.58s -> 17183.46s]  I don't think they're public domain. Appreciate it though. Thank you. Femme Enting Dregs. This was
[17183.46s -> 17192.02s]  $25. Femme Enting Dregs. Thanks. Thank you for a better movie night than I've seen in the past
[17192.02s -> 17200.08s]  five years in the old facilities known as theaters. Here's half the cost of what a movie ticket was
[17200.08s -> 17206.66s]  going to in about a year from now the way things were going. If you're keeping going in these times
[17207.22s -> 17215.50s]  have a blast. I'm having a blast so far. $25 for a movie ticket. Yeah. Did I read that wrong?
[17215.50s -> 17220.43s]  Probably. Thank you for a better movie night than I've seen in the past five years in the old
[17220.43s -> 17226.53s]  facilities known as theaters. Here's half the cost of what a movie ticket was going to in about a
[17226.53s -> 17233.25s]  year from now the way things were going. Hope you keep these things going. It's been a blast so far.
[17233.25s -> 17253.87s]  I did it right. I read that word for word. That's correct. Hey, Evangelion. The room is spinning.
[17253.87s -> 17262.30s]  No, it's not. Not even close. Hey, guess what? Plan 9 was actually the last film of Bela Lugosi.
[17262.30s -> 17267.87s]  The reason his face is hidden throughout most of the film either by his cape or by filming
[17267.87s -> 17272.19s]  is because it's actually a stand-in. The shots that actually show his face were filmed for
[17272.19s -> 17292.99s]  unrelated projects and then repurposed for this film. I'm not reading the same bits.
[17297.47s -> 17310.34s]  The show, you know, after his death in the order to draw in more of an audience,
[17310.34s -> 17323.46s]  they said it was Bela Lugosi's final film. Lugosi likely never met any of the actors in Plan 9.
[17323.46s -> 17333.36s]  Any more fun facts? That's so funny. The final actor, Lich, gave $50 fucking dollars and I missed
[17333.36s -> 17338.22s]  it, but they said these fucking aliens have space travel and guns that control dead bodies,
[17338.22s -> 17354.02s]  but humans have gone too far. Oh my God. Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[17354.02s -> 17365.36s]  Hey, Flimflam. $5. I got a burp. I can't mute it. Why? Why can't I mute this? What the fuck?
[17366.74s -> 17372.10s]  I tried. What the fuck? Stream Deck. What the fuck? Stream Deck, what are you doing? Mute this.
[17377.26s -> 17388.56s]  It won't mute. I don't know why. It sucks. Flimflam, thanks for the $5. Thanks for the stream.
[17388.56s -> 17393.95s]  I'd like to recommend The Pink Panther Strikes again for public domain movie night 2,
[17393.95s -> 17399.86s]  whenever that may be. Fairly certain it's public domain. If not, then please watch yourself.
[17399.86s -> 17406.85s]  If you haven't already, here's the link. Watch yourself? I think we've done that before.
[17406.85s -> 17419.55s]  Hey, Jerma, do you know that Bela Lugosi is dead? Stop. That's so easy to make me laugh right now.
[17419.55s -> 17427.89s]  Flimflam, another $5. Forgot you turned links off. Just search Uncle Carl, Uncle Earl's
[17428.45s -> 17436.66s]  classic TV channel, Pink Panther Strikes again. It's the first link. Uncle Carl's
[17436.66s -> 17456.93s]  Pink Panther. What the fuck is happening? I got it. Is this public domain though? I don't think
[17456.93s -> 17467.23s]  it is. Gotta be careful. Link is watching. Thanks for the $5. Sticks Renegade, thanks for $2.50.
[17467.23s -> 17477.17s]  Press J or L to FF or rewind 10 seconds, please. Plus press left or right on the arrow keys to do
[17477.17s -> 17483.39s]  5 seconds. I figured it out. Grizzly Wright, thanks for the $3. I'm making my first ever
[17483.39s -> 17492.93s]  Twitch donation to say that Santa is fucking stupid. Friedl Schlitz, thanks for $2.50.
[17492.93s -> 17497.54s]  Please make this a reoccurring thing. The stream has made me laugh out loud more than anything else
[17497.54s -> 17503.54s]  this month. Movies are more fun when you watch them with 7,000 other people. Also, you should
[17503.54s -> 17515.71s]  add Frog to the list. And its sequel, Frogs. They're both on YouTube. Oh, what's that? Another
[17515.79s -> 17525.31s]  $5,050 donation that I skipped and didn't even read? From Scripts 3?
[17525.31s -> 17532.19s]  Gerald, please. Just put on a Charlie Chaplin movie already. They're all public domain. Put on
[17532.19s -> 17544.22s]  the Gold Rush. That's the best one from him. Next time. Next time. Wolf Bowl, thanks for $5.
[17546.77s -> 17551.17s]  Did we really think that the ADHD streamer wasn't going to skip scenes and play fart and scream
[17551.17s -> 17558.91s]  sound effects? I don't know. I sent the message too early. I meant to say that I wouldn't have
[17558.91s -> 17564.34s]  had it any other way. Thank you for taking my fart sound effect suggestion. God damn it.
[17564.34s -> 17572.96s]  Abomination Zero, $15. Lots of fucking money. You have to do some Three Stooges shit for
[17572.96s -> 17591.74s]  Green Screen 2. I promise. But what about Bela Lugosi? Is he dead? Autumn Dragons, thanks for
[17591.74s -> 17597.58s]  the $2.50. Jerma, tonight was really fun. I'm really looking forward to future movie nights.
[17597.58s -> 17603.34s]  Call me a boomer, but it's fun to see what comedy was like back in the day. Also, in the future,
[17603.34s -> 17610.34s]  if it's possible, can you put on subtitles? It would help a bunch of us out. That's a rag on
[17610.34s -> 17617.22s]  your commentary or anything. Much love to everyone here. Congrats on getting to the top $500 on Twitch
[17617.22s -> 17624.66s]  as a Christian gamer dad streamer. Thanks. Hey, Snoozencopter, $2.50. Thanks for $2.50.
[17626.86s -> 17631.68s]  Today, after watching all these old movies and you making for the Fortnite YouTuber comment thing,
[17631.76s -> 17637.31s]  comedy really hasn't progressed at all. Every single YouTube and streamer comedy routine
[17637.31s -> 17647.42s]  consists out of making loud, funny, random noises and getting hurt in game. That will exist for the
[17647.42s -> 17656.13s]  next thousand years. Sorry to say. A Lars Blood Axe, thanks for $5. Charlie Chaplin made a movie
[17656.13s -> 17666.26s]  called Gold Rush in which he consumes a shoe. It's fate must be watched. Jerma put Sun Chips in F
[17666.26s -> 17674.78s]  tier, thanks to $2.50. More stream days, less stream hours. Kappa, to ban that person for
[17674.78s -> 17682.64s]  fucking 10 years. LM Man, thanks for the $5. Jerma, I wish you were quiet during the gorilla movie.
[17682.64s -> 17692.42s]  I really enjoyed it. I was fucking, I didn't, I shut the fuck up. Dr. Zoot Suit, $5. I can't believe
[17692.42s -> 17699.39s]  you actually played Jump King. I was kidding. Why did you read that? I'm so sorry. The fucking
[17699.39s -> 17707.81s]  stream is over anyways. Who cares? J Ran Cree, thanks for $15. So there's going to be another
[17707.81s -> 17712.83s]  Jump King stream where you beat it all over again, right? Hope so. The first time around was the
[17712.83s -> 17722.86s]  best. Either way, movie night was great. Let's do it again. I agree. Did I actually delete the whole
[17722.86s -> 17737.62s]  fucking thing? So bad. Why would you put that on the menu? Anything Show Official, thanks for $5.
[17738.93s -> 17744.29s]  You should do a Red Baron night tomorrow night where you play the old Red Baron games while
[17744.29s -> 17755.97s]  eating Red Baron pizza. I don't think so. Kirranj, thanks for $5. I missed about half the stream,
[17755.97s -> 17761.30s]  so I'm really excited to watch the VOD, but you have no idea how happy this movie stream idea
[17761.30s -> 17769.04s]  makes me. Older movies, mostly sci-fi and horror, also the B movie variety, are a big interest of
[17769.04s -> 17776.50s]  mine. So I'm really happy to watch some with everyone. The issue with these bad movies,
[17776.50s -> 17782.50s]  if they're really hit or miss, and a lot of slow with gold nuggets in them periodically.
[17782.50s -> 17788.50s]  Regardless, it was fun as hell. I think we hit fucking gold the first four hours at the three or
[17788.50s -> 17798.94s]  four hours. Those first two movies were perfect. And then I drank too much. And the third movie was
[17798.94s -> 17810.66s]  terrible. Pretty much it. LM, man, thanks for the 250. If you're going to play Sam and Max season
[17810.66s -> 17815.34s]  three, I won't. Have you ever considered playing Strong Bad's cool games for attractive people?
[17815.34s -> 17821.38s]  It's made by Telltale. I will not. I'm not going to play Sam and Max season three. It didn't grab me.
[17821.38s -> 17831.04s]  It wasn't a fan. It's just the way it is. Hey, Chimtrees, thanks for $3. I can't wait to see the
[17831.04s -> 17838.50s]  giant leeches in Germany. They won't be there. It will be sucked cigar and a waffle. Thanks for $5.
[17838.50s -> 17849.17s]  Remember, why did you become so hideous? It's called going past 35 happens to everybody.
[17849.17s -> 17857.39s]  Sorry, it happened to me. You posted cringe, bro. Thanks for the 10 bucks. Wait, is it over? I
[17857.39s -> 17862.56s]  thought you were watching multiple movies. That's why I'm just now tuning in. Looks like I'm the
[17862.56s -> 17877.15s]  clown here. I pay hands. We watched three movies and one three stooges TV show. I don't know when
[17877.15s -> 17887.90s]  you got here, but you probably don't hear him in the third movie, dude. We watched. We we watched
[17887.90s -> 17897.68s]  three. The leech counts, even though we skipped 30 minutes. It counts blueberry juice. Thanks for 250.
[17897.68s -> 17903.46s]  Hey, pal. Hey, pal. I hate to do this to you, especially so I can tell you're having so much
[17903.46s -> 17909.94s]  fun, but I'm going to have to write you up for a SUI. That's right. Streaming under the influence.
[17910.58s -> 17915.94s]  I mean, we can all have fun here or there, but deleting your save. It's fine if chat does it,
[17915.94s -> 17921.54s]  but you're the designated driver of this stream, not us. No, the only way to pay this off is if you
[17921.54s -> 17926.34s]  raid rift tracks, you know, considering you basically ripped off, you ripped off their entire
[17926.34s -> 17942.32s]  career. Mike Nelson's fucking Mike Nelson's a huge influence on my life. You got it. Are they live?
[17942.32s -> 17947.36s]  But we have worried somebody else. I've read it rift tracks like last week. They're fucking
[17947.36s -> 17953.60s]  fantastic. They're great guys. Goobery. Thanks for the 250 again. No, that's a lie. It's the same
[17953.60s -> 17961.78s]  message. Dr. Clay. Thanks for $5. If you ever do this again, please green screen yourself in the
[17961.78s -> 17969.31s]  lower right as a silhouette. That would really be copying Mike Nelson and those MST 3K guys. So I
[17969.31s -> 17978.64s]  don't know if I want to do that. Hey, crunch $3 from crunch PS. If we're talking older movies,
[17979.66s -> 17983.66s]  uh, not sure if you're into the universal monsters, but in my opinion, the invisible man
[17984.72s -> 17991.38s]  from 1933 is the absolute best universal monster movie they put out. I wish it were public domain
[17991.38s -> 17998.46s]  because I think it would be a great fun watch with everyone. It's too bad. Regardless, uh,
[17998.46s -> 18002.22s]  it's not an obscure recommendation, but I'd still recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it.
[18002.22s -> 18009.74s]  It's one of my favorite movies in general, actually. Thanks again. I wish it was in public
[18009.74s -> 18024.35s]  domain. We'd watch it right now. God damn it. Hey hatchet. Thanks for $3. Thanks for the very
[18024.35s -> 18031.30s]  fun night. Hope we get to watch some Charlie Chaplin next time. Probably. We watched three
[18031.30s -> 18037.26s]  stooges this time. Why not next time? West you'll thousand bits, $10 German. I'm watching this in
[18037.26s -> 18043.38s]  VR with my best friends. Why would you watch this in VR? We're all major fans. PS, did you get your
[18043.38s -> 18054.42s]  haircut? Doesn't look like Lego hair. No, I smeared it back on the back of my head. It's just greasy
[18054.42s -> 18061.44s]  and smeared back. Don't be fooled. Hey Keith King Crimson. Thanks for $2.50. Hey German. Fun fact.
[18061.44s -> 18069.39s]  Bella Lugosi is alive and well and he's in my house right now. Okay. Um, I hope you guys have fun.
[18069.39s -> 18075.07s]  Hey Joe mount. Thanks for $5. German. Are you excited to be 80 plus years old and streaming
[18075.07s -> 18080.45s]  shitty video games? That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. I can guarantee you.
[18080.45s -> 18089.23s]  Hey stream beyond. Thanks for $3. What do you do with bits in this? I'm not going to fucking be
[18089.23s -> 18096.13s]  live at 80. I got my golden years guys. Give me a break. What do you do with bits in this stream?
[18096.13s -> 18100.37s]  Is it some kind of currency thing? Thanks for the fun stream today and all the laughs you've
[18100.37s -> 18105.60s]  brought. Just so you know, the people who made who killed captain Alex made another movie.
[18106.98s -> 18116.27s]  That's also free. I've seen that one too. I've seen the sequel. Unfortunately, we can't watch
[18116.27s -> 18126.35s]  it here. I've seen it. Uh, cast lion. Thanks for $3. German on the topic of Bella Lugosi. I,
[18126.35s -> 18131.78s]  can we stop talking about this guy? You should watch Bella Lugosi meets a Brooklyn gorilla.
[18133.06s -> 18139.76s]  No, no, we're not, we're not talking about him anymore. Uh, I own you. I own you. You. Thanks
[18139.76s -> 18151.25s]  for $3. German actor died movie. Hey, he X in X. Thanks for $3. Thanks for the free bucks. I
[18151.25s -> 18163.94s]  still can't believe you deleted. By the way, I can't believe you. Uh, the whole stream has been
[18163.94s -> 18170.78s]  a blast. By the way, Bella Lugosi died. Laugh about it. I can't. Tana King. Thanks for the $15.
[18171.98s -> 18181.02s]  Why didn't they need the language computer when talking in person? I don't know. The movie's
[18181.02s -> 18189.30s]  terrible. Hey, Sculptor. Thanks for $5. German. You should watch the movie Ed Wood by Tim Burton.
[18189.94s -> 18195.86s]  It's a great comedy biopic about Ed Wood's life. In it, you learn that Bella Lugosi actually died
[18195.86s -> 18202.42s]  before the movie was completed and they, Bella Lugosi is dead. Yes. Hey, you posted cringe, bro.
[18202.42s -> 18207.78s]  Thanks for the thousand bits. Uh, I recommended Little Shop of Horrors for the next one. Although
[18207.78s -> 18213.86s]  Vinny might've already watched it on stream. Also F in the chat for Bella Lugosi. Yeah, let's see
[18213.86s -> 18222.61s]  him. The guy died like 40 years ago. F in the chat for him, I guess. I don't know. Uh, Medi Miren.
[18223.25s -> 18229.04s]  Thanks for the $5. German. It's test time. I hope you've been studying question one.
[18229.97s -> 18236.10s]  What happened to Bella Lugosi during plan nine? He died and they filmed it anyways and he's dead.
[18236.10s -> 18245.25s]  Thanks for the $5. Uh, Shibururu. Thanks for $3. Chat clearly loves Lugosi. Cheers to him.
[18245.25s -> 18251.47s]  I'm sure he'd germ a heart for all the love. Also all the people freaking out about freaks.
[18251.47s -> 18261.25s]  That movie's too smart for their little minds, I guess. I didn't say it. He did. Hey, Flimflam.
[18261.25s -> 18268.35s]  Thanks for the $5. That website that has the Pink Panther movie states that their public domain.
[18268.43s -> 18278.27s]  Gotta get that confirmed before I do that. I would do it. Neuro Gasly. 500 bits from Neuro Gasly. Hey
[18278.27s -> 18282.43s]  man, in case you didn't know, Bella Lugosi isn't actually dead. He was pretending I was there. I
[18282.43s -> 18288.90s]  was also the gorilla. That's good to know. Thanks for the fucking $5. Uh, Myriad. Thanks for $15.
[18288.90s -> 18295.62s]  No message. Just a huge amount of money. Thanks for 15 bucks. Uh, Glumrot. Thanks for $3. German.
[18295.62s -> 18301.73s]  I just came from my friend's goth DJ set and he can't get it to work. Can you help him come
[18301.73s -> 18309.42s]  to unplug it and plug it back in? If not, then tell him to, uh, just sell it all. Hey, uh, Vibio
[18309.42s -> 18314.22s]  game. Thanks for $5. Movie night was an absolute blast. Thanks for so much. Fantastic streams.
[18314.22s -> 18321.22s]  I'm semi delirious from laughing. Looking forward to the next time you do this.
[18321.22s -> 18328.27s]  Me too. It'll be fun. Uh, thank you. Bella Lugosi's ghost for the $5. Wow. Must've made
[18328.27s -> 18334.03s]  that name five seconds ago. Hey, German. I heard you enjoyed my final movie. Hope you can watch
[18334.03s -> 18338.43s]  more of them in the future. Cool. Thanks for the $5. Bella Lugosi's ghost guy that made this
[18338.43s -> 18344.99s]  fucking username 10 minutes ago. Uh, Spooge. Thanks for $3. Hey, I've been lurking recently
[18344.99s -> 18349.82s]  and haven't been super active in chat, but I'm glad to have these streams to keep us all company
[18349.82s -> 18356.38s]  during these lockdown hours. Loving it every day. By the way, when's the next FTK stream?
[18356.38s -> 18363.86s]  Are you going to play Resident Evil 3? Uh, FTK is currently being developed. It's going to be fun.
[18363.86s -> 18369.73s]  This is going to be events. It will return. I promise. I just don't have a date.
[18369.73s -> 18378.85s]  Resident Evil 3. Uh, streamer is going to lie to you. Streamer is lying to you. Hey, Evangelion.
[18378.85s -> 18386.30s]  Thanks for the $2.50. Did you know Dick Rubin is dead? He did props for 99 movies in his life,
[18386.30s -> 18395.06s]  including Sex Kittens Go to College. That's not porn, by the way. Weird title for a not porn movie.
[18395.06s -> 18400.64s]  He was responsible for those terrible garbage leeches. IMTV is amazing. Anyway, he's dead.
[18400.64s -> 18408.94s]  Isn't that interesting? Oh, and he worked on some Star Trek, I guess. I guess. Thanks for the $2.50.
[18408.94s -> 18416.19s]  Uh, thanks Sturdy Bread for the $2.50. Dr. Clay's suggestion was created in sub chat.
[18416.19s -> 18430.99s]  There is an MST 3K silhouette of Yu, Shito, and Beanbag Sonic. Jesus Christ. He's in hell.
[18435.38s -> 18441.39s]  Don't say that! Worm Club, thanks for $2.50. Hey, Jerma, I love Moominite. You should, yeah.
[18442.46s -> 18452.70s]  You and chat seem to like comedies the most. Please consider Buster Keaton's Shurran Jr.
[18452.70s -> 18457.26s]  It actually entered public domain this year and is full of Keaton's insane stunts,
[18457.26s -> 18466.05s]  one of which almost killed him. Okay. Oh, by the way, Bella Lugosi is dead. I didn't know.
[18466.05s -> 18470.86s]  Thanks for asking. Cigar and a waffle, thanks for $5. I can't stop watching your streams,
[18470.86s -> 18481.04s]  but I really don't like you. What the fuck are you doing here? Go watch Fucking Breaking Bad.
[18481.04s -> 18487.57s]  I don't get out of here. What are you doing here? Jerma put sun chips in F tier and I would again.
[18488.29s -> 18493.82s]  Just so you know, thanks for $2.50. I was able to successfully free Bella Lugosi from King Crimson's
[18493.82s -> 18500.06s]  home. Please call the cops. I can hear his footsteps behind me and that person. Uh, Alomar
[18500.06s -> 18504.06s]  waffle. Thanks for $3. Thanks for the tons of laughs. As always, please look into how public
[18504.06s -> 18516.48s]  domain works before you get banned. It's fucking, it's not illegal. What are you talking about?
[18516.48s -> 18522.69s]  Hey, you posted cringe, bro. Thanks for five more dollars. Uh, Lella Bogosi was born before
[18522.69s -> 18529.31s]  the movie was completed. Funny fucking comment. Hey Johnny, nice mountains. Thanks for $5. Why
[18529.31s -> 18534.11s]  are you making a mockery of Bella Lugosi's recent passing? He died like 40 years ago. Thanks for the
[18534.11s -> 18540.45s]  $5. Uh, Cthulhu Katamari. Thanks for the $3. Hey Jerma, love the stream. Fun fact, Bella Lugosi
[18540.45s -> 18545.49s]  never actually existed. He was just a green screen. Thanks for the three bucks. Uh, Fritz in the house.
[18545.49s -> 18550.29s]  Thanks for $6. 66 fucking Satan money. I love the stream. Felt like we were all a part of an episode
[18550.37s -> 18555.97s]  of best of the worst. I really like to see more of the mystery films. I love seeing the chat lose
[18555.97s -> 18565.98s]  their minds as it played out. Me too. Hey, to address the subs, please. We had some subs here.
[18565.98s -> 18585.58s]  We had a lot of subs to dress them. He's drunk. I mean, did you need a fucking scientist to tell
[18585.58s -> 18591.98s]  you that one? I could have told you that 10 minutes ago. What are you talking about? Uh,
[18591.98s -> 18598.38s]  thanks for the subs, everybody. Appreciate all the continued support. You guys fucking spoil the shit
[18598.38s -> 18608.61s]  out of me. Here they come. Thank you. Hope you enjoyed movie night one. Movie night two will
[18609.78s -> 18617.50s]  definitely happen. Just not now. That was a ton of fun. I even, I had some drinks. It was a blast.
[18617.50s -> 18621.02s]  I would fucking do it all over again. A million times. Thanks for staying around. Thanks for
[18621.02s -> 18634.45s]  hanging out. We do have a few more hits to do. Uh, Johnny nice mountains. Thanks for $5. Why are
[18634.45s -> 18639.89s]  you making a mockery out of Bela Lugosi's recent passing? I'm not. Uh, I didn't even know he died
[18639.89s -> 18648.30s]  30 years ago. Thanks for $5. Uh, I already read that one by the way. Hey, Skizzoy. Thanks for $5.
[18650.03s -> 18656.77s]  You should check out the goth band Bajas. Their most popular song is called Bela Lugosi's Dead.
[18657.49s -> 18664.37s]  I think you'd like it. Great. Maybe. Hey, Goo Berry Juice. Thanks for $4.50. Sir, this theater
[18664.37s -> 18667.81s]  doesn't tolerate noise pollution and drinking, so I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.
[18668.61s -> 18677.78s]  However, I can't believe I deleted the fucking save. We are obligated to give you a movie
[18677.78s -> 18683.22s]  fun fact before we evict you from the premises. Bela Lugosi didn't delete his Jump King save file
[18683.86s -> 18689.63s]  on stream. Now please take your monthly bath. I'm, yeah, I can't fucking believe I did that.
[18689.63s -> 18696.80s]  That's so stupid. I spent like so many hours on that. Hey, Jay Bum Bum. Thanks for the three
[18696.80s -> 18704.91s]  fucking Jesus. Germa, I said you were a greasy teen. Not that you had greasy teeth.
[18705.47s -> 18711.86s]  I apologize. Your teeth are pristine and perfect. Just like you, babe. This stream was amazing and
[18711.86s -> 18717.68s]  I'm excited for the next one. The next movie night I recommend Neil Breen. His movies are all
[18717.68s -> 18731.31s]  on YouTube. Sage the Ghost. Thanks for $5. Please will you cut your own hair on stream?
[18736.88s -> 18748.82s]  It, they say do it for Lugosi. I don't fucking know who that guy was. I don't, I didn't know him.
[18749.76s -> 18755.54s]  Thanks for the five bucks. Hey, $3 from, uh, Peridotty. Thanks for the three bucks. Germa,
[18755.54s -> 18764.13s]  me and my boyfriend and watch your streams and vlogs. I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out
[18764.13s -> 18772.38s]  of here. I'm out of here. Uh, I just want to say thanks for the laughs. We love you. Also,
[18772.38s -> 18783.23s]  can you say hi Chris? Yes. Hi Chris. I'm not going to cut my hair on stream. Oh,
[18783.31s -> 18795.12s]  this is fucking funny. Uh, Hey Chris, I'm glad you to watch the streams and one more. No, seriously.
[18795.12s -> 18800.58s]  Thank you for watching. Anybody that watches, I fucking thanks a lot. Agent Dark booty. Thanks
[18800.58s -> 18804.82s]  for the $5. Streaming goes to theater, gets drunk and rants about Bell Lugosi's death.
[18805.38s -> 18812.74s]  I didn't, you did and I read it. Hey, steer, steal, a steal. Thanks for $5. Jeremy,
[18813.38s -> 18817.62s]  I've watched you for so long without donating. You are pretty cool for a guy named Jeremy. What's
[18817.62s -> 18828.53s]  the fucking, what's that supposed to mean? Steel. What do you mean? You know, are the Jeremy's that
[18828.53s -> 18836.16s]  suck. I'm a cool art. I'll see you guys on Monday. Thanks for watching. I had so much fun. I hope you
[18836.16s -> 18849.70s]  did too. We're going to raid. It's a, it's a, it's a Friday night. Who are we rating? Not rift tracks.
[18850.50s -> 18854.19s]  Give me some names. Give me some names. Name, name, name, name, name, name, name.
[18856.66s -> 18866.00s]  That's a bad, that was the front page of Twitch talent. Criken, Criken, Bernie Sanders, critical,
[18867.87s -> 18883.97s]  Vinny. Who have we never rated before? I want someone we'd never rated. Never. Who's Greg? I
[18883.97s -> 18894.75s]  don't know what the fuck Greg is. What are you talking about? I do a guy with, no, not Bernie's
[18894.75s -> 18904.02s]  not live. What are you talking about? I've rated Nova a bunch of times. Nova's awesome. We've rated
[18904.02s -> 18924.38s]  critical. Who have we not rated before? Let's say, let's say who's playing games. Who's playing
[18924.46s -> 18929.02s]  Nintendo games? I'm a Nintendo streamer guys. Who's playing Nintendo games right now?
[18941.57s -> 18958.11s]  See, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who's playing fucking Mario? I want to, I want a Mario streamer
[18958.11s -> 18967.52s]  and that's it. Mario. Who's playing Mario? Mario. Why? Because Sue, I want to, I want to
[18967.52s -> 18974.32s]  rate a Super Mario fucking. Somebody's playing Super Mario. Bela Lugosi is dead. I can't rate
[18974.32s -> 18995.94s]  him. I can't fucking, can't believe I'm saying this. Okay. We've got, let's take a look down.
[18995.94s -> 19008.66s]  Discover list. Nope. Categories. Okay. Minecraft. Nope. Animal Crossing. No, thanks.
[19009.46s -> 19015.84s]  Mario Maker 2. No, thanks. I mean, the game's good. Mario Kart 8.

[19098.88s -> 19126.00s]  on? What? Cancel. What the fuck? Don't do it. I've already done it. What? I'm missing bits.
[19126.00s -> 19138.18s]  Where are their bits? Oh, shit, I did. He's playing Mario Galaxy 2. What's the fucking problem? What?
[19138.74s -> 19156.80s]  He's currently arguing with people on stream. I feel like I do that too.
[19165.38s -> 19182.08s]  What's going on? Read my bits. All right. Holy shit. Skulper. Thanks for $5.
[19182.88s -> 19187.54s]  Remember to answer your question to me and my friends. We're watching in VR
[19187.54s -> 19191.46s]  so we can hang out while we do it. Also love the stream. Lugosi for Rumble.
[19192.18s -> 19196.34s]  I don't even know what he looks like. Johnny. Nice mountains. Thanks for $5.
[19197.22s -> 19202.62s]  I saw a picture of you and Bella Lugosi at Comic-Con. You both shaking hands while you stare
[19202.62s -> 19215.84s]  creepily into the camera. I don't fucking even know who that is. All right. Go fucking dumped.
[19215.84s -> 19227.42s]  Just go tell italics to fuck himself. Let's go. Why is everybody losing their fucking minds over
[19227.42s -> 19252.30s]  this? Getting vetoed by the chat. What the fuck? Look at Mario streamers. No, don't do that. He
[19252.30s -> 19267.84s]  kills people. What? No, don't actually say go fuck yourself. Just be nice. Do you read chat? I just
[19267.84s -> 19273.06s]  read it. All right. I'll see you guys on Monday. Take care. It was a lot of fun. I had a blast.
[19273.06s -> 19280.26s]  Thanks for watching, as always. It was a ton of fun. Thanks for participating. Go tell italics
[19280.26s -> 19289.58s]  that he's a fucking swell guy. Wait, he's ending the stream? Oh, fuck. He's ending.

[19326.06s -> 19364.67s]  like him. He's doing GTRP. Good night. Goodbye. See you Monday. Same spot. Same exact spot.
