[4.60s -> 22.90s]  Welcome to the stream. Hi everybody, welcome. It's me. I'm almost not late. I mean I'm not late.
[22.90s -> 31.38s]  How can you be almost not late? You are either late or you're not. So we're gonna finish
[32.34s -> 39.38s]  Katamari Beautiful after we finish the DLC. I think there's another one or two levels in the
[39.38s -> 43.30s]  base game and then there's I think six or seven DLC levels. We're gonna smoke them all.
[44.26s -> 55.53s]  I'm anticipating that will take somewhere between two and four hours. No, maybe it'll take a little
[55.53s -> 59.37s]  shorter. I don't know. Maybe it'll take longer. I don't know. Regardless how long this takes,
[60.25s -> 66.10s]  if there's still some time, which there probably will be. I don't- Bumbo came out. I didn't even
[66.10s -> 77.08s]  know that. The Legend of Bumbo released last week. I kind of been waiting for it. It's the
[77.16s -> 85.75s]  binding of Isaac prequel. It's a weird match three kind of card game. I don't know. Edmund
[85.75s -> 92.98s]  McMillan just makes crazy shit. So I want to try it. It's addictive as fuck. Well, that's good to
[92.98s -> 101.06s]  hear. So we started Katamari last night. I'm gonna finish it. We're doing this thing where I start
[101.06s -> 106.66s]  game, finish game, but there's still it's been like two and a half hours. So start new game.
[109.32s -> 117.53s]  The train just keeps moving, apparently. I also, I kind of, I don't know, I kind of like want to
[117.53s -> 122.73s]  play the Star Wars game. I just keep seeing people talk about it. I seen the lightsabers
[122.73s -> 134.09s]  and the dodge rolling and just like, I think I want to play that. He's a fake Star Wars fan.
[134.09s -> 143.29s]  I own more Star Wars clothes than anybody. I mean, does that mean I'm a big Star Wars fan?
[143.29s -> 152.06s]  Does it mean that I shop exclusively at Walmart? You're wearing an Aquaman shirt right now. I am
[152.06s -> 164.46s]  not. It's a decent game from what I hear. Yeah, and we never play brand new releases. Sometimes
[164.46s -> 172.90s]  we do. When a triple A game releases, you 99% of the time don't see it on this channel. So
[173.86s -> 183.74s]  yeah, the ape game. Yeah. But that was, is that a triple A game? I don't think so. That's like
[183.74s -> 189.40s]  a double A game. You literally only play monkey related games when they release.
[197.56s -> 206.60s]  That's true. That is a true statement. But still, I'm talking non-ape related video games.
[207.24s -> 215.06s]  We'll see how it goes today into the next week here. But I don't know, I might play
[215.06s -> 221.82s]  Bumbo and get addicted and I never play anything else. But let's finish Katamari.
[224.06s -> 227.74s]  Beautiful Katamari. Already got it open and I'm already at the next level.
[233.32s -> 238.84s]  I have no plan. We're kind of in a mystery world here. Well, not right now. I'd love to say I'm
[238.84s -> 244.62s]  playing Katamari. This isn't Dead Rising. I beat Dead Rising. Yeah, Dead Rising 2.
[245.58s -> 250.06s]  One go. One save file. Well, I mean, I mean, no restarts is what I meant to say.
[251.80s -> 258.36s]  Yeah, I did that. Somebody's gonna pogchamp and go, are you fucking serious? Yeah, add it to the
[258.36s -> 265.10s]  fucking badge. All right, this is called Schloss Cosmos. Roll up a powerful things
[265.66s -> 274.10s]  to make a supergiant. This might be the last base game level to find out. Welcome to the icon of
[274.10s -> 281.22s]  the princedom Schloss Cosmos. A grand space for an epic race to roll a supergiant.
[282.82s -> 288.74s]  We want you to collect lots of powerful things. Sumo, Rikishi, wrestlers, elephants and bulldozers.
[289.38s -> 301.96s]  The supergiant needs to have some stopping power. Anywho, let's go. I wonder what song we're gonna
[301.96s -> 309.93s]  get this time. I missed big bits. Big bits. Did they? Yeah, they did. File actor at Lichon
[309.93s -> 324.12s]  of the 5,000 bits. That's so much money over the last few months, man. Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[324.12s -> 328.12s]  Just saying, Jeremy, the new Star Wars game is kind of like Star Wars Dark Souls. Best Star Wars
[328.12s -> 335.80s]  game in a long time. I know, I know, but I've heard, I've heard very mixed things about it.
[335.80s -> 342.44s]  I've heard it's a great game. I've heard it's too safe. I've heard it's too hard. I've, I,
[342.44s -> 359.16s]  it's, I kind of just want to see for myself. You ready? I'm gonna die to lightsaber wheel.
[359.80s -> 365.08s]  I gotta form my own opinion, asshole. Why'd you call me an asshole? Hold on, this thing has to
[365.08s -> 372.76s]  be 10,000. That's a huge, this is absolutely the last base game level. I have 20 minutes to roll
[372.76s -> 382.86s]  10,000. Holy shit. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I want to make my, I just said that I want to make
[382.86s -> 388.62s]  my own opinion on it. What is a review? What is like somebody telling you, you know what I mean?
[388.62s -> 393.94s]  Like, I'm gonna make my own opinion. That's what I just told you. We gotta plug the black hole.
[394.58s -> 402.12s]  We need this to be an unimaginable size and all cosmos is home free. Otherwise,
[402.12s -> 410.94s]  squishville. Wow, it's not easy being you, is it? All right, let's go. This thing has to be
[410.94s -> 428.14s]  10,000 kilometers. Off to a terrible start. It's a pretty good song.
[433.10s -> 441.14s]  Uh, little cars. I'm already one beater, so. How the hell am I gonna do this? It seems too big.
[442.10s -> 458.26s]  Get all the chicken. Can I pick up people? You have 20 minutes. Yeah, that goes fast though.
[458.98s -> 463.40s]  I mean, anybody that's been on this stream, in Time Plaza and you're having fun, 20 minutes is
[463.40s -> 483.06s]  like fucking two on this stream. We have just so much fun. See, it's already been, it's already
[483.06s -> 499.29s]  been three minutes and it's felt like 30. See? We have so much fun here. Let's get big enough
[500.55s -> 508.76s]  to get on the buildings. That's all I care about. I gotta get out of this, but three meters I can
[508.76s -> 518.22s]  go up. Bikes will do it. Yep. All right, let's go. I'm gonna go up this way. Wait, where was it?
[520.18s -> 529.82s]  This is the best game? I agree. This is a great game. All the Katamari games are awesome.
[531.96s -> 544.33s]  What was the last? Is this the last Katamari game? Besides the reboot? No, what was the last one?
[544.97s -> 554.62s]  There's another one on the PS3. So did they just kind of, I mean, I guess once you do this enough
[554.62s -> 558.46s]  times, there's only so many times you can make this game where you're just like, yeah, we kind
[558.46s -> 566.81s]  of did it all, huh? I would love to see, I know it's, what else would they do? I would love to see
[566.81s -> 572.09s]  another Katamari, like a current gen Katamari. I feel like you can make it bigger. The scope could
[572.09s -> 576.25s]  be larger because that's what happens in a game like this. It's like, well, what do we do? Do we
[576.25s -> 578.65s]  just keep the same game but just make it even bigger?
[579.93s -> 599.72s]  Pick them up? Yep. Let's go down the road. Katamari with guns and crafting. All right,
[599.72s -> 616.70s]  he's talking. Katamari with guns and crafting. What is it? It's 15 to get over the next hill,
[616.70s -> 626.52s]  right? I might just go up there now. He'll just do it now.
[626.52s -> 642.65s]  Oh, that looks like a lot of time, but there's a prince right there. Who's this? Is it a horse?
[643.21s -> 656.22s]  It's Kenta. Why aren't you eating your mash? What? All right, let's get the centipede. All right,
[656.22s -> 671.70s]  turn it around. This is it. All right. 10,000. I'm only 15 meters. How is this going to work?
[672.58s -> 687.75s]  We need bigger stuff. Run over the trees. Run over the tank. There we go. Tons of people.
[696.12s -> 708.68s]  Go. Get over to that car park. All right, and this whole city here. We've got everywhere.
[708.68s -> 721.19s]  That's what I'm trying to get around. Everyone always says, dude, what if the earth and where
[721.19s -> 728.49s]  to end? We're going to get hit by an asteroid or something. That's boring. I wouldn't be much
[728.49s -> 759.38s]  prefer this. No. Why? Wait, you just want to get hit by an asteroid? What about don't get hit by
[759.38s -> 765.11s]  one? What about nothing? Yeah, I'm saying in the event that there's like a catastrophic space,
[765.83s -> 784.18s]  like big bang type shit again. Yeah, if it had music, that's what I'm saying. If this music
[784.18s -> 804.36s]  just blasted. I got 12 minutes almost. Music would have to be fine. All right, back to the other.
[805.32s -> 816.33s]  I get the big ones. I can't. Can I get the big building?
[817.21s -> 832.87s]  Thanks. Nope. Head back over here. Got to get to a hundred. Once you get to a hundred,
[832.87s -> 839.94s]  that's when you can just start steamrolling every single thing across.
[845.40s -> 861.67s]  Two, three, four. There it is. All right, scoop them up. 60. You got to be 60 feet.
[868.22s -> 876.55s]  Get it all. Take up the whole earth. What? I still can't get it. This is the last level. This is the
[876.55s -> 884.04s]  last base game level. There are seven DLC levels. I'm going to try this. We're going to play.
[904.74s -> 918.70s]  I think it's island time. No, I need one more. Get the stadium.
[921.77s -> 941.29s]  Oh, another prince. Macho. I got him. Oh, it's right there. All right, go for the dinosaurs instead.
[942.98s -> 957.18s]  Present. Oh, what's the present? Yep, island time. Let's go. I got a lot of time.
[957.82s -> 970.84s]  Let's go get all the monsters. One more growth increase and I should be able to pick up the
[970.84s -> 993.00s]  actual island. Funny time. That's right. You get it. Bastard. Stadium. 300 to get the next increase.
[993.48s -> 1008.31s]  Oh, shit. All right, back to the turn around. This way. Jumped everything I wanted. Just pick up.
[1008.31s -> 1028.01s]  Damn it. Give me the bird. Oh, too small. All right, 300. Time to start moving. I can actually
[1028.01s -> 1052.73s]  pick up the ground now. Momentum. Too much momentum. Too much momentum. This way. I don't even
[1052.73s -> 1058.14s]  know what I just picked up. There's a whole other island over there I haven't even been to. This is
[1058.14s -> 1069.54s]  going to get you a lot. Please don't tell me to pick it all up. Some of it. 500. I need to get to
[1069.54s -> 1077.29s]  10,000. Not 10. I need to get to 10,000 kilometers. I'm not sure I'm saying that right.
[1082.76s -> 1101.06s]  Pick up all the pink. I'm stuck. Holy shit. Look at that giant octopus. All right, this way.
[1101.78s -> 1117.40s]  Look at all these mushrooms. Forward. Pick it up. Look at these penguins. Pick it up. A whole fat
[1117.40s -> 1126.49s]  penguin. What am I picking up? I think I got a present. All right, yeah, I got a present.
[1127.29s -> 1137.82s]  All right, I can't. I don't want to lose this, please. Okay. This is going to get insane. This
[1137.82s -> 1145.78s]  is so satisfying. What I just did right there was the equivalent of watching like 10 self-cutting
[1145.78s -> 1158.57s]  videos in a row. I feel great. Fuck. All right, forget it. Just go. I have to move. Turn. Turn.
[1158.57s -> 1179.06s]  It won't turn. I'm trying. It's too big. I don't even know what to say. There's too many islands.
[1180.92s -> 1197.91s]  Is this what it looks like from space? Imagine this is what it actually looked like out of
[1198.71s -> 1207.59s]  the window from the space station. Would you guys, like, if you were an astronaut,
[1207.59s -> 1217.72s]  would you talk about this? Would you want to take a picture of this? I feel like the worlds
[1217.72s -> 1233.88s]  is better off not known. I don't even know if I'm picking anything up. Get the whole city.
[1235.05s -> 1254.79s]  Yeah. 10,000. Where the fuck am I going to do that? Can't get the volcano. I don't think I can get
[1254.79s -> 1276.20s]  the octopus either. Nope. Not yet. What is even left to pick up? Did I get him? I got him.
[1289.37s -> 1318.55s]  Only two. Get the dragon. Got you. Holy shit. Uh, this is earth. Oh, 400.
[1322.28s -> 1354.10s]  Well, this started to really, really pick up. I need to get to 10,000. Hurry. Cousin. Got him.
[1355.88s -> 1371.54s]  It's Mag. Uh, I don't know if I'm going to do it. It's going to be close. Really close.
[1372.26s -> 1391.19s]  I can't pick up the land. I'm trying to get it. Let's get all of Antarctica.
[1396.94s -> 1411.94s]  Come on. I can't get. What is that? USA? I need more land mass. There we go. Right here.
[1420.14s -> 1465.61s]  Get it all. Quick. 5,000. One minute. Come on. I'm not even close. No. 6,000. Get it all. No.
[1465.61s -> 1485.98s]  It's going to be so close. Australia. I got it. What's left? This way. What's left? 9,000. I did
[1485.98s -> 1499.37s]  it. We're finally in space. Somewhere out here is the yucky black hole. I have to plug the black
[1499.37s -> 1508.33s]  hole. I don't think I won. How about a two minute bonus to level the field? I got nice. I got this
[1508.33s -> 1519.03s]  perfect. Okay. Don't go near. Don't go near the black hole. It'll suck you in. Wait until the
[1519.03s -> 1533.98s]  Katamari is big enough to plug it. Where's the black hole? Oh my god. I'm getting all the planet.
[1534.78s -> 1549.18s]  Pisces. Orion. There's the sun. I can't get the sun yet. What? What? What? What? Danger. Danger.
[1549.18s -> 1565.37s]  Danger. Get away from there. I can't see it. You're near the black hole. Run or it'll squish you.
[1565.37s -> 1578.78s]  Where is it? Shoo from the black hole. I can't see it. Wait, is that? That's him. Oh, there it is.
[1578.78s -> 1596.14s]  I see it. Okay. Turn around. Give me that planet. Approaching black hole. Approaching black hole.
[1596.86s -> 1615.78s]  I'm not big enough. What do I have to be? 500,000? Something hyper. It's ace. Oh shit.
[1616.50s -> 1643.32s]  I only got 30 seconds. Am I big enough? How big do I have to be? 10 seconds. I gotta be a million.
[1643.32s -> 1653.83s]  Oh fuck. I'm not gonna do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. All right. Very nice. This Katamari
[1653.83s -> 1662.98s]  looks kind of big. But why is it here? We did say it's to plug up the black hole. Then why is it
[1662.98s -> 1671.94s]  still here? You want to take it home? Oh, go on then. But wait. What about the black hole? It needs
[1671.94s -> 1678.18s]  to be plugged up. Why don't you listen to us? You don't want to help? We have nothing to say.
[1678.34s -> 1687.80s]  Too bad, bad. Sorry. Shame. Resignation. Wrath. Con. Put that silly ball down and come over here.
[1691.08s -> 1710.10s]  God damn it. Shit. That's a lot. That's sad. I need to get to a million. Okay. I'm gonna go quick now.
[1710.82s -> 1723.77s]  It's all right. It's all right. We can still do it. Omega lull. 20 plus minutes. It was fun though.
[1723.77s -> 1735.96s]  I'm just gonna be faster. Okay. I get two extra minutes. Here we go. That was a warm-up run. Bad
[1735.96s -> 1772.87s]  RNG. Bad spot. Bad spot. This is bad RNG. Sorry. I'll make it work. Can't get people yet.
[1776.63s -> 1804.14s]  Bad RNG. Bad RNG. It's okay. I gotta get to three. Better not. Why is this whole town on fire?
[1809.98s -> 1817.74s]  Second I get to three, we're turning that corner. This might be salvageable if I get over there
[1817.74s -> 1839.88s]  quick. Damn it. Come on. I'm almost there. That's a shit start. That's kind of a shit start for me.
[1841.82s -> 1844.70s]  I gotta make this up very quick. I have to make this up now.
[1859.34s -> 1894.87s]  Still possible. Oh, it's a shit start. Should I restart? Hmm. Oh. If I can get to the next
[1894.87s -> 1901.14s]  phase really quickly, then I don't have to restart it. Add elephant fucking RNG to me.
[1913.56s -> 1974.15s]  That's a lot of time that I just made up. Down here? Decent. Okay. Decent. All right. Come back.
[1974.15s -> 1980.60s]  Don't, don't lollygag. I'm not, although I, I do, I will admit I did look over at the copypasta
[1980.60s -> 2006.68s]  and I read it. That was my mistake. House is looking good. It's key forward momentum.
[2006.68s -> 2030.49s]  This is the one I want to be in. Right here. Don't hit the plane. Don't hit the plane.
[2034.97s -> 2059.91s]  All right. Next town. Next town. Next town. Next town. Back up here. Stop the pasta. There's no way.
[2060.55s -> 2069.74s]  I can't. Why do you expect me to do that? Everyone says don't put it on slow mode.
[2069.74s -> 2087.80s]  But why is R9K on? You got your answer. It's in front of you. 12 minutes. Is this enough time?
[2088.76s -> 2119.48s]  Blow it. I blow it. That's a reset right there. I blow it. Do a jump. How's my pace from last time?
[2120.36s -> 2135.91s]  Worse? Is it worse? I can't tell.
[2159.50s -> 2167.50s]  Chat is worse than ever. Fuck. All right. Just wait a minute. Give me a minute. I'll figure it out.
[2167.50s -> 2189.30s]  Just hold on. I need to get those clouds. Stop interrupting me. Ping. Let's get out into the
[2189.30s -> 2224.10s]  ocean now. Get the whole Antarctic. I can get most of this shit right now. Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
[2224.10s -> 2237.46s]  This way. This way. This way. Fast. That was a good line. This is fucking Tony Hawk level.
[2237.46s -> 2278.34s]  That's like a million points. Spin. Good. That was pretty damn good. Oh no. I didn't want to
[2278.34s -> 2289.27s]  go over that. Wasting time. I mean it was really cool, but what a waste of time that was.
[2293.10s -> 2314.57s]  Go forward. Forward. Forward. Hold it. You have to relax. No, there's no relaxing. All right.
[2314.57s -> 2327.18s]  I'm going for the rainy city over there. All right. Almost at the point where I'm going to
[2327.18s -> 2333.42s]  get like five times my size. Let's get this entire island. Don't leave it. Get it all.
[2334.78s -> 2356.58s]  Got some present. The line going. I'm going to go forward. Right to the volcano.
[2357.30s -> 2371.80s]  Can I get the volcano? Remember, I get two. Flip around. I get two extra minutes.
[2375.24s -> 2398.74s]  No. Can't get the volcano. Still can't get the. No, I got. Go faster. I'm trying. I need to get
[2398.74s -> 2417.77s]  up like four. It's gonna happen. Three. All right. This is where it starts. Hurry up. It's all about
[2417.77s -> 2448.42s]  the clouds here and the right here. Pick up all the sand. Because it said it couldn't be done.
[2449.38s -> 2461.64s]  It might not be done. I still have to do it. Trying to pick up as big the island as I can.
[2462.68s -> 2471.91s]  All right. I know. I know. I got somebody. Good. Good to know. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger.
[2471.91s -> 2483.18s]  Bigger. All right. Can I pick up all the sand? I think so. I'm gonna get this and I'm gonna spin
[2483.18s -> 2505.11s]  around. Come on. I don't want to do it again. It's 20 plus minutes. All right, I got. That
[2505.11s -> 2529.81s]  that was Europe right good I think I can pick this up nope go fast
[2529.81s -> 2561.63s]  oh it's so hard the tournament is this big not big enough for that I think I have an
[2561.63s -> 2575.38s]  extra two or three minutes than I did last time that was so much faster I got
[2575.38s -> 2585.77s]  six minutes instead of two do not go into the black hole two minute bonus

[4115.96s -> 4130.39s]  like 780 million I didn't look at chat one fucking time I trusted that one guy
[4130.39s -> 4156.49s]  that said a million because that seems so such a perfect number to do if you're
[4156.49s -> 4172.92s]  enjoying this I am except for when I don't do the fucking this is actually
[4172.92s -> 4177.16s]  gonna be the last time now watch me get sucked up by the black hole do not think

[4281.67s -> 4289.10s]  expelled the energy you want your energy back sure don't eat a banana go eat a
[4289.10s -> 4315.04s]  salad go eat go have a hamburger waste some time one guy always prevail power
[4315.04s -> 4327.84s]  the power in the one guy is so wrong the next time you don't think you have like
[4327.84s -> 4335.29s]  any power in the world just come to German 985 you will change the course of
[4335.33s -> 4381.95s]  whatever I'm doing as long as you're the only one I can't get over that I've

[4544.85s -> 4553.22s]  room well that was if I got sucked into the black hole prematurely not if I lost
[4553.22s -> 4562.94s]  around he's that big

[5509.92s -> 5519.42s]  like you see doctor I I lied to my live stream about eating ghost pepper and then
[5519.42s -> 5522.86s]  I got I was brushing in the evening because I told everybody I was gonna eat
[5522.86s -> 5528.62s]  it because I was malting during catamari the final level I got sucked into the
[5528.62s -> 5532.62s]  black hole and then he's gonna drop his fucking data sheet right he's gonna be
[5532.62s -> 5538.48s]  like fuck that level I'm gonna be like we talking about fuck that level he's
[5538.48s -> 5543.96s]  gonna be like yeah I remember that level I mean what is with the developers
[5543.96s -> 5548.64s]  putting an instant lose scenarios in 20 30 plus levels 30 plus minute levels
[5548.64s -> 5554.52s]  I'm gonna be like what I thought what is that I remember that level and it took
[5554.52s -> 5567.30s]  me like 10 tries oh by the way because you ate the ghost pepper you're dead in
[5567.34s -> 5580.95s]  three days oh and then he's gonna walk out of the room and under his lab coat
[5580.95s -> 5586.08s]  I'm gonna see he's gonna have molting skin like this gonna be like a big cape
[5586.08s -> 5590.00s]  of vaulted skin like he's already done this shit he did it like two weeks ago
[5590.00s -> 5617.55s]  this might be the best run yet and I get up and shake his hand I'm like he takes
[5617.55s -> 5622.39s]  a step out I take a step out and I step on his like wedding gown skin and he
[5622.39s -> 5654.77s]  flies forward and I fly forward it's wicked embarrassing what event I'm just
[5654.77s -> 5662.11s]  I'm just trying I'm venting this is the best run I've had since starting my
[5662.11s -> 5679.64s]  career on Katamari he's distracting us from the ghost pepper all right car can

[5687.92s -> 5697.56s]  have a bell pepper that I get somebody's like a ghost makes I mean that's
[5697.56s -> 5711.57s]  technically would be a ghost pepper right no what who cares about eating

[8637.90s -> 8642.18s]  such a fucked up opinion to a lot of people I might actually lose some of you
[8642.18s -> 8648.30s]  as viewers for saying this it's actually very possible when I say this some of
[8648.30s -> 8653.54s]  you might now have such a bad opinion of me that you don't want to be here
[8653.54s -> 8665.52s]  anyway it's like I do oh I do I don't not every time but it's sometimes when I

[8743.19s -> 8748.71s]  fries and mayonnaise like I like the way that the texture and I like the kind of
[8748.71s -> 8752.43s]  deep flavor that it with the fries and the crispiness and you may as well just
[8752.43s -> 8757.11s]  told them that you love to swallow fucking spit like I may have just asked
[8757.11s -> 8762.75s]  that person to spit on in my mouth hey if I lean back can you spit in my
[8762.75s -> 8787.12s]  mouth what the fuck that's like that's the kind of reaction do I like pizza in

[8828.02s -> 8836.82s]  mayonnaise with my fries in rewind hey could you go into like the cat litter
[8836.82s -> 8854.04s]  and dig out cat shit and put it on my food same reaction I need luxury lily
[8854.04s -> 8864.46s]  pads aren't luxurious and we need animals now Earth has lots of living
[8864.46s -> 8869.16s]  things not as many as it used to which makes us sad here's an idea you can roll
[8869.16s -> 8874.56s]  up creatures everyone needs to pick me up now and then yes do you have any
[8874.56s -> 8883.71s]  favorite friends English style small ones slow ones snails mouse lemurs we
[8883.75s -> 8891.27s]  prefer the Giants whenever we're on earth we visit with whales we swim and
[8891.27s -> 8897.19s]  jump and feast by the light of the start there are old friends and we can't find
[8897.19s -> 8902.71s]  though did we all offend them that would be just often we have big friends on
[8902.71s -> 8909.54s]  other stars too we got big friends big enough to wrestle like the fish and
[8910.10s -> 8917.85s]  this is a Trump spawned in a grease trap fire fast-food store we confess he's the
[8917.85s -> 8921.57s]  only creature that scares us just a little though and only when he's eating
[8921.57s -> 8926.05s]  anyway we want you to gather lots of creatures friends from all walks of
[8926.05s -> 8930.45s]  hops and slithers of life we think of Katamari maybe the ideal ecosystem I
[8930.45s -> 8942.15s]  just saw Tabasco sauce on an s-tier convent list yep you did all right
[8942.15s -> 8958.58s]  animals there we go on the tier list I think I already did it people animals
[8958.58s -> 8964.66s]  yeah that man I guess it's true and people are just whether the animals
[8964.66s -> 8984.88s]  right no people are animals people aren't in they are we're a species of
[8984.88s -> 8994.84s]  animal okay I'm gonna do a state's tier list yeah it would be like
[8994.88s -> 9003.37s]  Assachusets Nevada I don't know like New Hampshire I've only been to like five
[9003.37s -> 9021.46s]  states guys how am I supposed to do that well that's not true I've traveled to a
[9021.46s -> 9026.24s]  bunch of states but I haven't spent enough time in them to give them put
[9026.24s -> 9050.53s]  them on a tier list earth is so many plants all right name a state I'll tell
[9050.57s -> 9054.90s]  you if I've been there before no no no no no no name a state I'll tell you if

[9147.21s -> 9156.64s]  already said that one Texas interestingly enough no I in fact have
[9156.64s -> 9162.56s]  never even been to the state of Texas not even once like a connecting flight
[9162.56s -> 9174.23s]  or something I've never been to Texas we've been to Rhode Island but not Texas
[9174.23s -> 9184.08s]  yeah I lived in New England for 30 years oh but I not go to Rhode Island Maine

[9190.76s -> 9196.29s]  then again Papa gave up the most powerful job ever so we can be the king
[9196.29s -> 9202.21s]  of all the cosmos does giving up power make you more powerful thinking face do
[9202.21s -> 9207.41s]  you grow into power by growing out of it thinking face whoo getting too near the
[9207.41s -> 9221.14s]  deep end of the pool let's just stick to rolling up powerful stuff what's a
[9221.14s -> 9242.80s]  surprising Florida yes Minnesota no California yeah New York yes Montana no
[9242.80s -> 9250.95s]  Alabama nope lots of powerful things Arkansas nope
[9250.95s -> 9273.53s]  go back no that's all right we need to roll up playtime he's getting big how
[9273.57s -> 9279.67s]  have I not been to New Jersey well I've been I've been in New Jersey but I've
[9279.67s -> 9287.69s]  never been there for more than a couple days yes I've driven down the driven
[9287.69s -> 9292.33s]  I've driven through New Jersey and I've spent maybe like a two hours there
[9292.33s -> 9317.16s]  from a pump to Brazil 12 hours is enough but that's okay here's the thing a lot
[9317.16s -> 9322.36s]  of people don't realize especially if you're not American if you are a non
[9322.36s -> 9324.88s]  American watching right now you're probably like wait how the fuck you live
[9324.88s -> 9330.88s]  in the United States have you never been to some of these places and because why
[9330.88s -> 9336.35s]  I don't have a reason is they may as well be other countries look I know you
[9336.35s -> 9342.72s]  can go from like France to Denmark in like seven hours in a fucking train it's
[9342.72s -> 9356.40s]  a it's USA is huge and it may as well be like eight different countries from the
[9356.40s -> 9360.55s]  climate from the different climates that are in America to the different
[9360.55s -> 9369.47s]  types of people that are the different cultures it's a huge place and I know I
[9369.47s -> 9391.87s]  know I do my prize English style but I'm an American but yeah people I was all
[9391.87s -> 9399.40s]  right let me tell you something the difference between Nevada and Alabama it
[9399.40s -> 9413.10s]  we may as well be on other planets one of them is like the desert and the other
[9413.10s -> 9423.52s]  one is like a swamp the United States is just Dark Souls it's just a Dark Souls
[9423.52s -> 9443.92s]  map it's a video game region it's Warcraft zones I got a little ocean
[9443.92s -> 9462.83s]  stuff yep yep VR Josh I have not paid it I have not even been looking at the
[9462.83s -> 9468.27s]  screen I've been reading chat at least 10 to 12 straight minutes I've just been
[9468.27s -> 9488.92s]  moving these sticks long as this level that's a great question long enough to
[9488.92s -> 9494.68s]  hopefully not fail it's my opinion on ketchup
[9507.70s -> 9514.06s]  ketchup and mayonnaise well you just made a dressing ketchup and mayonnaise is
[9514.06s -> 9539.16s]  the thing already thousand islands now you got my attention I can't really eat
[9539.16s -> 9547.12s]  it anymore but I was a fiend for Tabasco and ketchup
[9547.12s -> 9556.15s]  you would do ketchup and a little thing a little cup the cup with the that's is not
[9556.15s -> 9560.19s]  that's all you need and then stir it up with a french fry
[9560.19s -> 9576.38s]  that's so that's the blue you do like two or three bloop bloops and that's all
[9576.38s -> 9589.72s]  you need you don't need anything else more energy more energy and that's what
[9589.72s -> 9601.24s]  I'm doing when is it eating the ghost pepper I already did man oh it's good
[9601.24s -> 9628.57s]  burn socks tears tears tears are coming down tears are coming down
[9636.24s -> 9654.25s]  we've got you're grasping them never been aggressive to stop you before
[9654.25s -> 9667.57s]  all right we're hopefully nearly full grown we've managed to put on some size
[9667.57s -> 9673.56s]  haven't we we find the sound of our own voices soothing we sort of lose track of
[9673.56s -> 9678.66s]  everything else but we're quite content with the job you've done you're free to
[9678.66s -> 9683.58s]  roll up whatever you like we'll nap if you'd like to stop just hit the X button
[9684.14s -> 9718.06s]  what about the DLC levels they're gonna be the DLC levels are gonna be just not
[9718.06s -> 9736.46s]  even interesting if I roll up every single thing in the game I got some roll
[9736.46s -> 9743.33s]  up the key here he is rolled up he's in there the DLC levels are more themed
[9743.33s -> 9754.37s]  now I'm getting flashbacks I don't want to be going with the big
[9754.37s -> 9770.53s]  posthumous thing again I beat it let's do these themes levels just get it over

[9856.66s -> 9866.90s]  and that's I've never taken giraffe off I've ever had old bay yeah I have old
[9866.90s -> 9871.64s]  bay's all right it's good on a lot of stuff but I wouldn't just put it on
[9871.64s -> 9885.52s]  anything do I like my steak with a one the back when I was like 14 I would put
[9885.52s -> 9891.45s]  A1 on the steak because I thought it made me more of an adult I thought
[9891.45s -> 9897.70s]  ordering A1 made me look older and look like I knew what I was talking about at
[9897.70s -> 9905.08s]  restaurants also another funny thing I used to lie to my dentist all the time
[9905.08s -> 9910.33s]  for no reason when I was like 13 I would tell them I don't know my brother used
[9910.33s -> 9915.13s]  to laugh his ass off at this he still brings it up sometimes when I would be
[9915.13s -> 9919.85s]  in the chair and we'll be talking about how things are going yeah I get any
[9919.85s -> 9923.01s]  concerns anything going on yeah you're brushing twice a day yeah you're

[9932.69s -> 9940.88s]  your mouth from all the commercials and the dentist would always be like oh okay
[9940.88s -> 9953.98s]  that's that and that is a straight-up lie right it is they used to have
[9953.98s -> 9964.56s]  commercials for Trident where it was it cleaned your teeth was that real it
[9964.56s -> 9992.80s]  can't be it's true the backpack is Connor okay now I'm gonna stay with the
[9992.80s -> 10001.06s]  draft how to Mario Memorial go to the crown what do you think I'm doing I did

[10160.73s -> 10177.04s]  away from the person like a stew in their head what is that $1 purchases

[11217.64s -> 11237.30s]  section again no don't get stuck don't get stuck six hundred down nice
[11237.30s -> 11247.98s]  I've ever swallowed gum on purpose no it gives me anxiety because I was told that
[11247.98s -> 11252.30s]  it takes nine years to have gum go through your whole digestive system so
[11252.30s -> 11274.55s]  it made me scared forever only seven years how would a rumor like that even
[11274.55s -> 11282.24s]  start to scare you it was done no I know it's parents trying to scare their kids
[11282.24s -> 11287.12s]  so they because kids oh this is yummy delicious tastes like fruits no but they
[11287.12s -> 11290.48s]  don't you're not supposed to swallow it down so what if we just tell make up this
[11290.48s -> 11296.48s]  huge lie about if you swallow it you're fucked for ten years don't swallow that
[11296.48s -> 11305.22s]  gum little Timmy it's gonna stay in you for seven years it terrifies you I get
[11305.22s -> 11314.79s]  it it's kind of funny because I'm pretty sure if bagel and cream cheese takes
[11314.79s -> 11318.51s]  longer to go through your body than gum if you were to swallow it takes like
[11318.51s -> 11337.11s]  four days
[11341.73s -> 11351.75s]  that was barely worth it what kind of bagels do I like I like everything
[11351.75s -> 11372.80s]  bagels or onion I will tell you I'm not a sugary bagel kind of guy cinnamon
[11372.80s -> 11387.47s]  raisin bagels no French toast bagel no it's not into it come on down here

[11404.66s -> 11414.26s]  something that I want every day but I do like it yeah smoke salmon cream cheese
[11414.26s -> 11419.98s]  it's great you got to really be in the mood for it though it's kind of heavy
[11419.98s -> 11440.02s]  red yes yarn to string even bagels have more sugar than a candy bar yeah white
[11440.02s -> 11447.88s]  isn't white bread the equivalent of eating cotton candy like in your body
[11447.88s -> 11458.40s]  this process the same way it's worse is it I've heard I'm telling what I've
[11458.88s -> 11472.68s]  cream cheese capers that's the only place where I think I would ever have
[11472.68s -> 11485.52s]  actual want capers is on locks and bagels that's only in America you guys
[11485.52s -> 11493.64s]  are strange and put sugar in everything I'm not into that wait special rule for
[11493.64s -> 11498.36s]  the day make a big ball of yarn and string look at I love this level already
[11498.36s -> 11507.57s]  this is makes me want to play Zuma let's say this big in three minutes one meter
[11507.57s -> 11518.04s]  that's not very much time okay yarn cloth string be crafty and spin a ball
[11518.04s -> 11526.90s]  of many colors all right let's try it
[11526.90s -> 11548.38s]  what the hell can I even pick up here I need to pick up something okay can I get these I need to get bigger but this one's going to be
[11548.38s -> 11560.53s]  satisfying check this any more colors than red no I don't like it we've gone
[11560.57s -> 11565.61s]  over this before on screen but just the people that have never been here you're
[11565.61s -> 11573.25s]  only supposed to take in I think men are supposed to take in 38 grams of added
[11573.25s -> 11581.49s]  sugar a day and I think I think women are supposed it's like 32 or 34 but one
[11581.49s -> 11587.86s]  can of coke is your whole daily allowed limit for added sugar that's I kind of
[11587.86s -> 11605.51s]  fucked up three cokes a day dad dude I used to pound code red I would drink
[11605.51s -> 11616.80s]  code red every day I got it back downstairs I love this level this stuff
[11616.80s -> 11626.81s]  is awesome I might replay this level just to feel good the sugar is everywhere
[11626.81s -> 11634.33s]  only take it in 37 38 grams of sugar a day added like damn that's hard to do
[11634.37s -> 11650.92s]  it's in everything and then you see well I just do sugar-free that shit's bad for
[11650.92s -> 11658.75s]  you too
[11673.51s -> 11679.24s]  one minute 30 seconds
[11686.36s -> 11717.23s]  that means you have an iron that's all right I got to think what can you eat
[11717.23s -> 11725.52s]  with iron in it spinach most meats liver if you I don't like chicken liver
[11725.52s -> 11728.68s]  but chicken liver is the one of the highest places you can get actual good
[11728.68s -> 11734.48s]  real iron I just I think it's gross so I can't do it but you can get from
[11734.48s -> 11747.80s]  spinach spinach iron content is not great that's a lie well it's one of the
[11747.80s -> 11751.64s]  plant-based ways you get it's not the same kind of iron you get from me and I
[11751.64s -> 11778.67s]  agree with you still there iron is just iron research has found that the intake
[11778.67s -> 11784.15s]  of meat heme iron but not plant non heme iron was associated with an
[11784.15s -> 11796.05s]  increased risk of stroke they're different that they're different there's
[11796.05s -> 11802.33s]  hem there's there's he may and non he may iron okay well
[11815.23s -> 11828.40s]  oh yeah I know what I'm talking about don't eat that he may iron but no
[11828.40s -> 11833.24s]  chicken liver oysters too that's another one I don't it's the worst thing ever
[11833.24s -> 11840.64s]  because but let me save you guys I will rescue everybody in here that needs to
[11840.64s -> 11844.40s]  get more iron in the diet let me save you let me rescue you listen to me
[11844.40s -> 11849.20s]  closely what's the one food that I told you that was really into and I was
[11849.20s -> 11853.16s]  buying and I was eating it for like before streams and after streams what
[11853.16s -> 11861.32s]  was it no not garlic what I was it was like a four-day tirade not tuna you're
[11861.32s -> 11870.18s]  close you're close I thought that was like three straight days they come in
[11870.18s -> 11877.71s]  a can they come in a tin sardines somebody got it finally sardines are
[11877.71s -> 11885.40s]  one of the best foods you can possibly consume on earth they got iron they got
[11885.40s -> 11889.64s]  vitamins they got minerals they got protein it's good shit it's really good
[11889.64s -> 11897.43s]  for you except for the sodium yeah and apples have cyanide in them you can't
[11897.43s -> 11912.35s]  win and coffee gives you diarrhea and garlic gives you heartburn you can't
[11912.35s -> 11915.87s]  there's no you can't win guys there's no winning with food you just pick you try
[11915.87s -> 11930.40s]  it is your best did I do this one no roll up constellation related things to
[11930.40s -> 11950.68s]  make the Milky Way every anyone who has ever eaten has died that's true garlic I
[11950.68s -> 11957.67s]  guess garlic is really good but everything has a con is there any real
[11957.67s -> 11970.12s]  food on earth that doesn't have one single con water but you can drink too
[11970.12s -> 11977.96s]  much water and get over hydrated yes you can drink too much water and you can die
[11977.96s -> 11990.40s]  if you drink too much water it's true what are we supposed to do you could
[11990.40s -> 12007.84s]  choke on a cinnamon roll so what I know it's dangerous human breast milk I don't

[12027.40s -> 12033.14s]  like the yard of that glam house alrighty let's go over the rules for this
[12033.14s -> 12040.03s]  one constellation namesakes does that blow your mind well mind or no mind you
[12040.03s -> 12045.92s]  have this much time to gather stuff related to constellations for
[12045.96s -> 12051.48s]  constellations like cancer a Leo and Pegasus you can find crabs lions and
[12051.48s -> 12061.25s]  winged horsies that's the equivalent of biting a red pepper not liking the heat
[12061.25s -> 12087.40s]  and fearing the color red that's how our ancestors did it let's go
[12094.60s -> 12098.32s]  88 constellations

[12156.21s -> 12161.00s]  attention to what you're eating before anybody like relieves the channel that
[12161.00s -> 12164.44s]  like it's just kind of that's not true that's a lie I'm kidding that's that's
[12164.44s -> 12168.08s]  an actual fucking dumb lie like somebody may be like about to leave and clicking
[12168.08s -> 12170.36s]  the X like what the fuck is that true and then look it up and like you look
[12170.36s -> 12187.92s]  scared I'm just that's a lie I'm kidding I'm in some way gone all that trouble in
[12187.92s -> 12191.84s]  public opinion because it was their chicken and their chicken sandwiches like

[12210.12s -> 12214.75s]  meat I think it was like 89% meat or something
[12214.75s -> 12218.31s]  Taco Bell is close Taco Bell is like 90 something I think 80 or 90 percent actual
[12218.31s -> 12267.20s]  real is it 100% got you it's not 100% Taco Bell proclaims that 88% of its beef
[12267.20s -> 12273.24s]  consists of premium beef and 12% of it is made up of a quote signature recipe
[12273.24s -> 12287.74s]  okay three or four rungs down is is Taco Bell horse meat why would you think this
[12287.74s -> 12293.71s]  is it what wait wait wait wait wait a minute wait this is this is not like a
[12293.71s -> 12312.28s]  scary Google hold on a second when was this I need to read this Taco Bell's

[12329.05s -> 12332.97s]  food to be implicated in a horse meat scandal sweeping Europe and the UK is
[12332.97s -> 12337.79s]  this an onion article I'm not like eating an onion right Taco Bell's ground beef is
[12337.79s -> 12341.63s]  among the four new four new products found in the UK's food standardization
[12341.63s -> 12351.07s]  to contain more than 1% horse meat am I eating the onion this happened wait 2013
[12351.07s -> 12368.69s]  why would they be a horse meat what happened EU horse eaters what Ikea got
[12368.69s -> 12374.89s]  caught in it with their meatballs what the fuck is happening wait who this is
[12374.89s -> 12381.24s]  2013 that's not that long ago Burger King in Ireland admitted that some of
[12381.24s -> 12391.85s]  its burgers contain horse meat Taco Bell sent this statement to stress that the
[12391.85s -> 12395.37s]  finding would not affect its US businesses our domestic restaurants
[12395.37s -> 12399.49s]  have not been and will not be impacted because we do not use any meat from
[12399.49s -> 12405.12s]  Europe we stand for quality and we use a hundred percent premium beef like all
[12405.12s -> 12410.40s]  beef in the United States ours is USDA inspected and then passes our own 20
[12410.40s -> 12428.78s]  quality checkpoints all right good to know Taco Bell 88% meat look at this is
[12428.78s -> 12435.98s]  just like how like fucking bullshit fake articles hold on so this is the headline
[12435.98s -> 12446.91s]  Taco Bell says their meat is 88% beef not 36% 30 well how would it spread that
[12446.91s -> 12468.47s]  it was 36% meat they thought people thought it was oats and starch oat meat
[12468.47s -> 12478.04s]  I want to get some delicious oat meat wait three to five percent is made of
[12478.04s -> 12483.73s]  oats starch sugar yeast and citric acid the rest is water and spices check the
[12483.77s -> 12494.39s]  full statement below oh shit it is five percent oat meat how long good this is

[12535.79s -> 12541.12s]  limited time menu that features tacos made with oat based meat but only in
[12541.12s -> 12549.55s]  three places in London let's look at all this news look at all this is weird

[14790.24s -> 14805.78s]  tier list I wonder how it differs from when I did it already I did I what if it's all completely
[14805.78s -> 14829.68s]  different one more just normal Joel's movie no I'm not gonna watch Joel's movie I'm not gonna watch
[14829.68s -> 14836.64s]  a movie no I will some other day that's 30 minutes I don't get that kind of time

[14859.59s -> 14867.43s]  and for this I I could not forgive you I've been distracted let's do it again you spent
[14868.55s -> 14888.88s]  two hours on one level I don't have time no we're gonna do a video watching stream anyways pretty
[14888.88s -> 14905.46s]  soon I'm not doing it tomorrow no I want to watch I want to watch like a movie on Twitch I
[14905.46s -> 14910.58s]  want to watch like a public domain movie and I guarantee you're gonna get sick of that real quick
[14910.58s -> 14921.59s]  so we can watch that movie there oh also while there's people here let's talk about this um
[14921.59s -> 14927.35s]  remember if you were in this pre-stream chat no you if you were in the post-stream chat I talked
[14927.35s -> 14934.15s]  we talked about this extensively yesterday we talked about stream that's gonna happen at some
[14934.15s -> 14943.80s]  point we've thrown ideas around of salt and germa where I get servers over the course of
[14943.80s -> 14950.74s]  a few different games and it's you I'm going to try to have as many people as humanly possible
[14950.74s -> 14955.86s]  in these servers let's say for instance a Minecraft server or a Conan exile server
[14957.38s -> 14965.54s]  and the whole goal is I'm the king and you have to do everything for me and if I die
[14966.96s -> 14979.67s]  the stream ends there are at least three or four games that I want to do this with
[14982.18s -> 14987.06s]  I'm gonna and what not just that that's just one piece of this I also want to set up like a king's
[14987.06s -> 14993.06s]  court where people come and like share their grievances with the king like we'll make like
[14993.06s -> 14997.38s]  a castle and shit and they'll I'll have like king's guard and you can come ask questions and
[14998.18s -> 15008.52s]  there'll be executions and shit I'm not gonna die in four seconds because I'm gonna have a
[15008.52s -> 15014.37s]  loyal king's guard there's gonna be like 20 people whose only job is to make sure that they're like
[15014.37s -> 15033.94s]  in like the gold armor to make it so I don't die me and uh me and cad were actually talking
[15033.94s -> 15041.89s]  about random stuff and like imagine a scenario where we play Minecraft and it's like bring me
[15041.89s -> 15056.53s]  50 gold bar gold boxes and make a statue of me or I execute five people I was like holy shit that's
[15056.53s -> 15073.28s]  fucking funny and now imagine there's 500 people in that server I want to collect taxes I want to
[15073.28s -> 15078.56s]  go door to door with my like king's guard and collect taxes and shit and if you try to kill me
[15078.56s -> 15085.25s]  or you better you better make it for real you better conspire with I'm coming to collect taxes
[15088.00s -> 15092.71s]  you fuck up an assassination attempt you're getting fed to the lions which is like a 12
[15092.71s -> 15113.28s]  foot dug hole with like aggressive wolves in it no lions are them lions in Minecraft I did it cool
[15113.28s -> 15119.40s]  that's fun but not just something like Minecraft but going to like here's the thing though like
[15119.40s -> 15123.64s]  Conan exiles I think you can only have like 50 people in a server why don't just get disconnected
[15124.52s -> 15131.86s]  so it would have to be we would have to whitelist people and maybe you'd have to like put an
[15131.86s -> 15136.98s]  application in as to why you should be in the town and I also want to set up a thing where if
[15136.98s -> 15141.46s]  we have a scenario like that oh you can only have 50 people in that server people are just
[15141.46s -> 15145.06s]  going to sit there and they're going to turtle they're not going to they're just going to you're
[15145.06s -> 15149.22s]  the same person's going to be there for like the whole other entire like three or four street by
[15149.22s -> 15160.24s]  the way uh the idea is that if I'm alive we keep going and the town progresses but um they'll be
[15160.24s -> 15167.92s]  aged so it'll be like one minute is like five to ten days and if you get to be like 60 years old
[15167.92s -> 15182.50s]  you die of old age so there's no you know we we're always cycling through people does the king age
[15183.30s -> 15188.39s]  yep but I'll age a little slower so I might just die of old age one day on stream
[15195.24s -> 15201.49s]  I just die of old age you gotta I'm gonna be a good king though what game am I thinking about
[15201.49s -> 15209.22s]  doing this in uh Minecraft is probably the easiest one to do it in there's also rust
[15210.10s -> 15215.38s]  there's also cone and exiles there's arc I'm thinking of any one of those games that came
[15215.38s -> 15220.02s]  out where it was just an open environment where you're supposed to build a castle
[15220.02s -> 15230.16s]  or build a thing with a bunch of people on the same server reign of kings there's a lot of them
[15230.16s -> 15241.25s]  and we could it could I want to make it a series but from game to game and scenario to scenario
[15241.25s -> 15248.37s]  for instance we talked about like I don't do anything it was going to be wow classic where
[15248.85s -> 15253.81s]  I was not going to play the game and if I had to exert any force then I would turn the stream off
[15254.69s -> 15262.68s]  that was the joke we were talking about last night and I was like if people want to actually
[15262.68s -> 15272.18s]  watch me do that shit we still could do that I don't know but imagine a scenario where there's
[15272.18s -> 15278.02s]  like a bunch of tunnels that I can like escape in in Minecraft somebody like if there's like
[15278.02s -> 15282.02s]  an angry mob outside coming in with bows and arrows it's like 30 of you that have all like
[15282.02s -> 15285.86s]  conspired that you're ready to go today's the day you're gonna go for the king oh better make
[15285.86s -> 15302.39s]  it there's 15 tunnels I'm gonna go through good luck I want to be like a living ecosystem for at
[15302.39s -> 15312.04s]  least a few days I don't know I might die instantly but I think it's worth doing I want to put like a
[15312.04s -> 15322.52s]  bunch of like time and resources into it I feel like it'd be really funny and really fun someone's
[15322.52s -> 15336.82s]  gonna shoot you in the head with an enchanted bow not if not if I look you gotta start from zero
[15337.46s -> 15343.36s]  it's gonna I'm gonna it's gonna be not easy I'm gonna I'm gonna mod those servers it's gonna be
[15343.36s -> 15362.32s]  you're gonna have age they'll be on your team we'll see your bodyguards will just be shields
[15362.32s -> 15368.88s]  well the theory is that to make it so I don't die in the first 10 seconds there's a you know town
[15368.88s -> 15374.88s]  hall and there's a castle and I have a room in the castle and all my loyal servants have rooms in
[15374.88s -> 15379.68s]  the castle and there's like 25 people in that castle that I gotta ring the bell if somebody's
[15379.68s -> 15390.84s]  climbing in my window with a fucking axe and I could defend myself too by the way if you die
[15392.69s -> 15411.96s]  that you're that's it you're out someone else is gonna take your place as a baby we'll just swarm
[15412.84s -> 15420.40s]  but will you though this is where it gets interesting because I'm not going to be like
[15420.40s -> 15428.02s]  a bad king I you know I'm just gonna I want the town to be sufficient and be moving forward and
[15429.19s -> 15434.08s]  there's gonna be lots of loyal people that are in this town well you think that they're just
[15434.08s -> 15441.62s]  gonna try to kill me we're gonna have trials there'll be trials by combat if you do something
[15441.62s -> 15446.93s]  wrong it's like if you if you get like arrested or if you try to kill me or something and I'm
[15446.93s -> 15452.53s]  feeling a little generous today the two people that tried to kill me that were working together
[15452.53s -> 15456.29s]  in their own little private discord you two have to fight to the death and whoever dies see you
[15456.29s -> 15477.65s]  later is the server gonna be hardcore probably not sure yet but I want to do this a few times over
[15477.65s -> 15484.87s]  a couple different games so this is all very preliminary but it's doing it for me and you
[15484.87s -> 15489.68s]  know one of the one is an idea that does it for me it's it happens it's just gonna happen
[15490.40s -> 15494.32s]  I'm gonna put a bunch of time and I'm gonna put some money into it too see if we can get
[15494.32s -> 15499.52s]  some like coded server shit that you know you can have aging in the servers and you just get
[15499.52s -> 15508.61s]  deleted and you die it should be fun but there are a couple different ways to play it we can
[15508.61s -> 15519.68s]  do them as many ways as we want what game that hasn't been decided yet it'll be probably like
[15519.68s -> 15526.48s]  minecraft rust reign of kings arc cone and exiles something but we can just openly just sort of rp
[15526.48s -> 15533.00s]  in on our own terms with our own rules in the server I want to see how long I last I want to
[15533.00s -> 15545.19s]  see if I have any loyal people that will protect me make it a weekly event that's the idea the
[15545.19s -> 15550.71s]  original title of the stream was going to be lazy fuck because I didn't do anything I just stood
[15550.71s -> 15555.43s]  around well everyone did everything for me and like money was poured into my like character's
[15555.43s -> 15579.32s]  account and stuff ego maniac all right let's move on I'm gonna do my tier list hey ball rolling
[15579.32s -> 15583.16s]  dlc is actually done all right give me a condiment tier list let's see one give me
[15588.56s -> 15594.64s]  that's the spy statue bit it's the spy statue bit but with actual rules and potentially
[15595.44s -> 15604.40s]  hundreds of people participating not just like three so it's a kind of an evolution of that
[15605.04s -> 15612.45s]  all right tear maker checks mix no not clicking that one us president's not clicking that one
[15613.33s -> 15616.61s]  is there even I where's the condiment tier list let me see it okay
[15617.81s -> 15629.11s]  this one sucks butter is on here who uses butter as a condiment butter that's not a condiment it's
[15629.11s -> 15635.83s]  like an ingredient you guys think it was gross when I said mayo and fries butter as a condiment
[15638.08s -> 15643.20s]  on vegetables yeah but that's like no no no no no you that's like part of the recipe you don't
[15643.20s -> 15654.16s]  just like you you guys add a bunch of butter on your vegetables are eggs a condiment too
[15657.12s -> 15667.83s]  ah fuck damn it that hurt okay uh this one I did better one something better than this
[15668.39s -> 15686.50s]  did you eat a toenail let me look about I'll just look one up world of warcraft expansions
[15687.88s -> 15695.36s]  condiments and sauces this looks like the one this is okay here we go this one looks a little
[15695.36s -> 15705.97s]  better let me get out of this game just give me one second while I do this that was katamari it
[15705.97s -> 15713.62s]  was a lot of fun those these games are wonderful that's how you know I have a real xbox and you

[15719.06s -> 15731.78s]  I'll do the expansions one two and I I could do this with my eyes closed why would why do
[15731.78s -> 15737.01s]  I even need to do this on camera I could just say it this was six of them
