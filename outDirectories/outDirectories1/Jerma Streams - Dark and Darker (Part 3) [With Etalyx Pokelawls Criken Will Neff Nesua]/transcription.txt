[21.69s -> 39.46s]  Hey, what's happening? How you doing? Honest to goodness, let's game. Yeah, more, I mean, you,
[39.46s -> 48.42s]  you know what we're doing. I don't gotta tell you. You know, I don't gotta tell you what we're doing.
[48.42s -> 58.82s]  You already know. Dark and Darker again tonight. Gonna be playing with a few different groups.
[58.82s -> 65.48s]  Gonna be jumping around. First group, we got...
[68.15s -> 83.86s]  Italics. Italics is here tonight. Permission to swag out. Yeah, sure, I guess. And then,
[84.58s -> 94.71s]  the other participant in the group for group one. Gonna be poke. Poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke.
[95.35s -> 102.36s]  Can we, can everybody yell, please? And then a little bit later, we're gonna maybe get
[102.36s -> 107.80s]  criken in here. And then later, I'm gonna play with Will Neff. I'm gonna be jumping around all
[107.80s -> 119.32s]  over the place tonight. So, but we'll start here. Trying to play with as many people as I can,
[119.32s -> 127.38s]  because it's obviously over in a few days. Promise not to germa this up this time.
[129.43s -> 136.36s]  I was not responsible for even half of those deaths. I was not responsible for half of our wipes.
[136.36s -> 141.50s]  You're talking about people, people were like paying money to kill me in the game. Like,
[141.50s -> 146.78s]  that's not, I don't think anybody was trying very particularly hard a couple days ago. I don't think
[146.78s -> 159.69s]  that's the case. But yeah, that's the plan tonight. After today, I'm not going to be streaming this
[159.69s -> 165.34s]  game again. I, this is the last night you'll see it. I'm gonna probably stream for a little
[165.34s -> 176.18s]  bit tonight. I don't know how long, but you know, we'll see. Because this weekend, on Sunday,
[176.18s -> 183.82s]  Ster and I are gonna do Elden Ring mods again. So, I gotta, I gotta move on to something else
[183.82s -> 194.82s]  at some point, right? And then after that, at some point next week, maybe that's when I'll tap back
[194.82s -> 199.75s]  into like sorcery. Breath of the Wild, maybe. I gotta finish some of this stuff, right? So,
[200.78s -> 205.18s]  we'll probably do that too. Maybe Frog Detective as well. Just gonna wait. Hylics. Yeah,
[206.06s -> 214.57s]  that's probably where you'll see that. The new randomizer seed. I think we're doing different
[214.57s -> 219.85s]  mods. I think we're doing randomizer with other stuff on it to make it even more ridiculous.
[220.57s -> 225.53s]  And I cannot promise that that we're going to beat the game again. But we're gonna at least play it
[225.53s -> 233.05s]  again and do one final just kind of mayhem run and just see what happens. So, I don't know,
[233.05s -> 240.84s]  we'll see. I am not promising we're going to play another like 30 hours of Elden Ring. But I don't
[240.84s -> 247.00s]  know what Ster has in store for us. Because Ster is the one that is putting it together. So, he's
[247.00s -> 250.84s]  putting all these mods together. So, he's, I'm just, he's just like, hey, I'll give, I'll give
[250.84s -> 255.48s]  you the folders when I need to. Or I'll tell you what to download when, when, when we're ready.
[255.48s -> 272.17s]  So, I don't know what it could be anything. Yeah, more dark and darker. I think I talked to Poke,
[272.17s -> 275.53s]  talked to Italics. Italics is currently in the call. But he is, I think, starting to stream
[275.53s -> 293.74s]  doing his intro. So, we're just gonna hang out. Seven Hour Visual Novel Mod Pack. Visual Novel
[293.74s -> 304.98s]  Elden Ring. How am I doing? I'm doing pretty good. I'm doing pretty good. Hope you're doing good.
[310.49s -> 314.09s]  Do you like circus peanuts? No, so you say this dude loves circus peanuts. I don't know where
[314.09s -> 321.83s]  you're getting that from. I like biting into a circus peanut. I like, the texture of a circus
[321.83s -> 328.34s]  peanut is very interesting to me. After that, it gets a little weird, I think. You can, I can
[328.34s -> 335.43s]  really only eat one circus peanut. And then I don't want another one for a year. But I, I don't,
[335.43s -> 346.92s]  I enjoy that one circus peanut. It's pretty cool. Texture, bro. This ain't Minecraft. Why is
[346.92s -> 355.42s]  something, why is texture Minecraft to you? It's not, everything's not Minecraft. Texture is a
[355.42s -> 366.98s]  word to describe tech. Oh my god, whatever. What the fuck? They've got a point. Texture,
[367.78s -> 384.94s]  everything has to be Minecraft. All right, let's see if we've got, let's see. Yeah, I'm gonna add
[384.94s -> 397.34s]  Poke, I think, right now. And let's get Poke in here. Poke and I have a very interesting
[397.34s -> 403.02s]  relationship. Poke and I were part of a team. Oh, I'll wait till Poke gets in here. Talk about
[403.02s -> 421.26s]  our Smite World Championship prospects. Hold on. There we go. Oh, whoops. Uh, I'll just call
[421.26s -> 436.65s]  Italics back. I made a different group. That's my fault. I forgot. I'm right now, I'm gonna call
[436.65s -> 449.53s]  with Italics and he's getting a call from me again. How does that work? Hey, what's up? How
[449.53s -> 456.34s]  you doing? Are you ready to get some dubs? Hey, are you ready to get a potential Smite World
[456.34s -> 462.82s]  Championship? Oh, there you are. What's up? Hey, what's up? Yeah, sorry. I had to, I called again.
[463.30s -> 471.99s]  I'm an idiot and I made two groups. That's all good. You sound the same. Oh, hey, what's up,
[471.99s -> 477.82s]  everybody? Hey, how are you? You sound the same, just nicer. Hey, what's up? Oh, hey, everybody.
[477.82s -> 487.13s]  How are you? Yo, I'm Poke. What's up, German Poke? No, it's been a while, Poke. It's been a while.
[487.13s -> 491.53s]  Played Smite, right? Yeah, and we were best friends. I retweeted that. That was really fun.
[491.53s -> 499.61s]  That was fun. We broke up, but we got over it and we're here. All right, so Italics does not
[499.61s -> 504.89s]  really know how to play the game, so I hope you're not ready to try really hard. I've got two. I'm
[504.89s -> 511.34s]  really good at teaching people how to play. Good, good, good, good, good. I do have some credentials.
[511.34s -> 516.22s]  Okay, I played a bunch of Tarkov. I played a bunch of Mountain Blade and I played a bunch
[516.22s -> 521.02s]  of Chivalry and this is just those games. He's fucking good too. He was one of the best fucking
[521.02s -> 526.15s]  Tarkov players I've ever seen in my life. Okay, you're good then. He's only seen one.
[526.15s -> 536.68s]  All right, let's do it. We'll poke. What's your name in the game? My name is Movie. It's okay.
[537.40s -> 545.16s]  I love that name. Just Movie. Yeah, I got lucky. That's actually pretty lucky. I was there when
[545.16s -> 551.93s]  the game just came up and I just put random names. I got Movie, I got Music, I got... That's like
[551.93s -> 557.85s]  putting David in. I also got Carl, just Carl. I was gonna say, yeah, I had to put a one on mine.
[558.41s -> 564.44s]  Carl has got fucked over, but I got all the Carl's. Carl one, Carl two, Carl three, Carl four.
[566.30s -> 571.58s]  This is the next one. I don't see your invite. URL Gold Rush. You can sell those on eBay now.
[571.58s -> 579.24s]  I allow your invite. You can invite me now. There we go. I got it. Yo. So you play fighter? Yeah,
[579.24s -> 583.54s]  I play fighter. Do you want me to roll something else? I'll swap, I'll swap. I have like... Oh,
[583.54s -> 592.25s]  fighter meta? I'm gonna try this. All right, what do I have? I'm bringing up Carl. Should I bring my
[592.25s -> 599.10s]  Zwayander for this one? No, not first match. That would be stupid. What the hell am I talking
[599.10s -> 608.14s]  about? Did you just ask if you want to bring like your most valuable weapon into my basically first
[608.14s -> 615.50s]  game? I'm likely to just friendly fire you at the first portal and just take it off your body and
[615.50s -> 623.72s]  then escape. Yeah, all right. I'm bringing you a weapon. Oh. Aetalics. Aetalics. My friends call me
[623.72s -> 633.30s]  E. No, you should say E-tal. E-tal. E. I got you, bro. Did you just call him Elm? Were you gonna call him Elm Tree?
[633.30s -> 638.33s]  Elm Tree? I thought you said Elm, like you were gonna call him Elm Tree. No, no, I'm gonna call
[638.33s -> 644.50s]  him E. But I got you a weapon. That's perfect. I got you a Z... No, no, no. Zwayander. My friends call me E. My
[644.50s -> 651.14s]  loved ones call me Biggie, so your choice. Oh, shit. All right. All right, you guys ready? Yeah.
[651.14s -> 658.74s]  All right, ready up. E. The game asked me if I wanted to check my loadout and I was like, no, I'm going
[658.74s -> 668.70s]  in naked. You don't have anything, do you? I know. All right, I gotta put headphones in. Polk, have you
[668.70s -> 675.94s]  done any of the red dungeons? Yeah, I've done a lot for this game. Are they hard? Yeah, it's hard.
[675.94s -> 682.78s]  I mean, it's kind of hard, yeah. Have you done High Roller? It's really hard. Have you done High Roller?
[682.78s -> 688.86s]  No, I'm terrified. I'm too much of a wuss. Let's get 100 bucks and go just for fun. Polk, I have a
[688.86s -> 696.73s]  lot of money. Like, my whole stash is gold coins and I'm just like scared to use them. Do the stashes
[696.73s -> 703.77s]  continue through demos or like wipe per demo? Yeah, it's gonna be all gone soon. You have to spend it.
[703.77s -> 713.10s]  No. You have to. Here, take the sword. I need to rebind Effany. Wait, where's it? Which one? I gave
[713.10s -> 718.09s]  it to him. I gave it to him, not you, sorry. What the fuck? Oh, I thought you have money. No,
[718.09s -> 726.15s]  I got one, yeah. All right, so, Taleks, here's how you click to swing. Oh, really? Let's fucking go.
[726.15s -> 734.10s]  Wow, great teacher. You ever played Mordhau? Yeah. Chivalry counts, hopefully? Yeah, yeah,
[734.10s -> 739.59s]  it's like that. Are we moving through this door or are you scouting? I'm sorry. I was moving,
[739.59s -> 746.46s]  I had to move something. Hey, by the way, Taleks, bugs kill, so be aware. Okay, do I have like,
[747.10s -> 754.98s]  is there an overhand, like an overhead swing or am I just cleaving everybody? Oh, no, yeah.
[754.98s -> 761.32s]  Third attack or a second attack, like a combo, like swing and then swing. That's right click.
[761.32s -> 767.26s]  Okay. But you can swing twice. Swing and then boom. Yeah, it's a three combo for everybody,
[767.26s -> 773.91s]  right? Yeah, just every weapon has a different animation, so. This game is so fun. All right.
[773.91s -> 780.63s]  Yeah. Oh my god. I'm sure I'm safe corner. There's shit everywhere, there's loot everywhere,
[780.63s -> 790.79s]  you have to get it. Oh, enemies, enemies. Where? I'm gonna fireball him. I got him,
[790.79s -> 797.77s]  direct hit. Nice shot. I'm gonna get him again. Did you just kill that person? No,
[797.77s -> 805.61s]  he got away though. All right, I'm so bad at this. It's a jumping puzzle at the beginning of the map.
[805.61s -> 812.42s]  This is a big tip E. E? Press X on holster and then to make this jump. I made a jump crouch.
[812.42s -> 816.41s]  Yeah, make sure you don't have anything in your hands, it's very hard. It actually,
[816.41s -> 821.27s]  nobody laugh at it if it doesn't make it. Oh my gosh. No, that was actually pretty impressive.
[822.47s -> 830.87s]  Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, you got it done. I won't say anything else. I'm going back to dome.
[830.87s -> 846.36s]  Oh, what was that? Where are they? Oh, okay. Are you alone? Oh, hey, I'm talking, communicating.
[846.36s -> 854.47s]  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's right. You did shoot two. Why am I acting like a meteor? You fucking attacked
[854.47s -> 860.46s]  them. I'm sorry. I thought you were a monster. I won't shoot you. He thought you were a monster
[860.46s -> 872.84s]  and he, that's why that happened. Don't worry. You're trapped. There's a trap here. You lied.
[872.84s -> 888.42s]  I'm fucking dead. We got an archer back there too. It's the last thing you hear. I'm dead.
[889.40s -> 896.07s]  You have to kill him. I'm hasting you. I'm going to go this door. I'm going to bounce off the walls.
[896.07s -> 901.30s]  They're trying to go. I hasted. I'm giving you invisibility. You're invisible.
[906.84s -> 913.50s]  Oh, that's actually a good strat lying on the internet. Yeah. What the fuck is going on here?
[915.16s -> 926.38s]  All right, Carl. I'm going in. Oh, got one in the head. Oh, I'm going in. One hit. Impressive.
[927.34s -> 935.22s]  Oh my God. It's how it's fucking gigachad. Nice, man. All right. Okay. I'm going to take
[937.03s -> 943.08s]  Jerma's soul. Okay. Yeah. So should I be looting right now? You loot. I'll go heal.
[944.39s -> 950.60s]  So there were two, just two. It looks like it was three. Yeah. But then we killed a third,
[950.60s -> 954.94s]  is what I'm asking. Yeah, they're all dead. Okay. They put a trap down on the door.
[954.94s -> 969.70s]  My last words were you lied. What a shitty way to go. I was trying to disarm it. Oh,
[969.70s -> 977.10s]  you right click to loot fast. Okay. So I just leave white gear. Yeah. Unless it can replace,
[977.10s -> 980.94s]  if you have nothing in it, if you have no boots or no, having something is better than nothing,
[980.94s -> 985.32s]  obviously. Yeah. It's going to take some white gear at home now. If you have nothing. Yeah. I
[985.72s -> 990.10s]  just beat those guys with no armor. Yeah. Well, you are barbarian. Barbarian is kind of.
[991.14s -> 995.38s]  Don't take this from me. Okay. It's all I have. Okay. Well, what you did was very good. Can you
[995.38s -> 1007.18s]  help me out, please? I need to help my friend. Oh, not me. Can you please help me out? Should
[1007.18s -> 1011.66s]  I be going over there? I just need to get to my friend, heal and arrest my friend. Are you good?
[1011.66s -> 1018.50s]  Everybody's so full of shit in this game. It's so funny. Yeah. Please don't hurt me. I'm very,
[1018.50s -> 1025.27s]  I have nothing. I have nothing. I have nothing. Yes. One of them is naked. Here,
[1025.27s -> 1036.44s]  you guys can have this. What did you give him? It's getting. What did you do? There's a heel
[1036.44s -> 1047.02s]  right here. Listen, E. Yeah. You got to hide. I got to hide. Okay. Yeah. You kind of. Or something.
[1047.02s -> 1051.02s]  Yeah. Figure it out. You got you guys kind of opposite directions right now. Yeah. We're on
[1051.02s -> 1059.08s]  like other side of that room. I'm looping around. I'm looping around. You got to. Oh, should I use
[1059.08s -> 1065.27s]  a bandage or something? Yeah. If you have any heels, definitely use them. That's the craziest
[1065.27s -> 1077.99s]  spider ever. It's still behind you. Not bad. Not bad. That did nothing. Okay. Yeah. The bandages
[1077.99s -> 1083.00s]  are pretty awful, but they're better than nothing. Healing potions are instant and they're kind of a
[1083.00s -> 1086.76s]  hot. It's like Diablo 2. Everything in this game is Diablo 2. Just imagine. Did one of these guys
[1086.76s -> 1091.96s]  have a heal potion? What is this? Yep. Pick that up. That's a heal potion. Oh, that's mine. Yeah.
[1091.96s -> 1098.58s]  Take that. Whoops. There's a resin here, but it's so. Oh no, it's going to be way too hard.
[1101.64s -> 1112.22s]  I can try. Is that a red bat too? Okay. Um, what should I do now? You, you should probably try to
[1112.22s -> 1121.59s]  find him. I think the walls closing in from the West. Oh yeah. You want to, uh, Alex, you want to
[1121.59s -> 1130.79s]  try to get to the sort of middle of bottom right of the circle. Are you okay over there? I'm being
[1130.79s -> 1139.51s]  shot at by your friends. I think. Oh yeah. I ran past them. Yeah. They're evil. Oh no, this is an
[1139.51s -> 1145.64s]  evil mob. Yeah. Oh, I'm screwed. Red. If the, if the skeleton is red or the monster is red,
[1145.64s -> 1152.87s]  it means they're an elite version and they're, they're horrible. Okay. Yeah. I'm dead guys.
[1152.87s -> 1162.22s]  Oh, you guys want to backseat game me? You're the one with the kills. Yeah, but I have no concept
[1162.22s -> 1168.54s]  of space or location other than there's apparently a wall here. Yeah. It's essentially what you're
[1168.54s -> 1173.90s]  looking for right now, Alex, is you're just trying to get out. So you're looking for a blue podium,
[1173.90s -> 1180.90s]  a blue podium. It's going to go and it's, it's kind of textured. Oh, Minecraft. It's textured.
[1180.90s -> 1187.86s]  So you'll know what it looks. It's blue, bright blue. Red goes to a different dungeon. So you
[1187.86s -> 1192.10s]  don't want to go to the red one. Blue. You're looking for that's a trap, right? That's a trap.
[1192.10s -> 1197.98s]  Yeah. Don't go there. Okay. But if the only other way to go, there's like three guys, I think you'll
[1197.98s -> 1201.74s]  live. No, no, you'll be fine. Yeah. If you just play it slow here. Well, yeah, play it slow and
[1201.74s -> 1206.84s]  just, you're just looking for a portal. There's at least three here somewhere in the circle. So
[1206.84s -> 1210.92s]  there's like three minutes left in the match. Yeah. Bottom right. Okay. You are just trying
[1210.92s -> 1215.64s]  to hear that. Yeah. Where's that coming from? That's that's that direction. That is a portal
[1215.64s -> 1219.32s]  coming up through the ground. It could be a red one though. I think it's a red one because you
[1219.32s -> 1224.95s]  can see the kill feed pop up, right? It's a three down portal portal. It's a red one. I think so.
[1224.95s -> 1230.34s]  This game sucks. Oh, yeah. Crouch here. Crouch. Yeah. Oh, right. Forgot. Yeah. This stuff that
[1230.34s -> 1237.34s]  shoots out of the walls. And it's almost impossible to tell. So when you're going through a little
[1237.34s -> 1243.90s]  hallway like this crouch, there's damage coming from nowhere. Okay. Is it it's okay to be like
[1243.90s -> 1248.86s]  walking around with a torch, right? Like, yeah. I mean, you're just trying to find a way out right
[1248.86s -> 1257.08s]  now and try to leave with whatever you picked up. Listen, I hear footsteps to my left. I think it's
[1257.08s -> 1263.42s]  behind you. There's another one. Did you hear that? Like, are you quieter when you're crouching? Like
[1263.42s -> 1268.68s]  in Tarkov? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are these invisible walls? Like, what is this? Yeah. You hit him five
[1268.68s -> 1285.35s]  times. Don't tell him. Can I sacrifice you to the great old ones? There it is. You need that. Yep.
[1285.35s -> 1294.02s]  Hitty. And just get out of here. It's the second it comes up. Well, the answer to that question
[1294.02s -> 1303.93s]  is no. How is he better than us? Hey, we're out. Easy game. I understand what the problem is.
[1303.93s -> 1309.05s]  Here's the thing. I was a distraction, right? So if I didn't stand in that trap, then they may
[1309.05s -> 1313.13s]  have been like, oh shit, like we got somebody and then they killed me and they were just really not
[1313.13s -> 1320.97s]  prepared for the next part. I claim about 20% of that victory. Well, I retired Carl and now I'm on,
[1321.53s -> 1330.44s]  I couldn't get the other names. I'm on Tom Guy Peter. It's my Ranger. Your names are like,
[1331.59s -> 1344.71s]  they're awesome. Can I show you my wizard? Yeah. There. Ice and frost. And fire. And, you know,
[1344.71s -> 1351.83s]  everything else. Et cetera, et cetera. All right. So, you understand the game now. You get it. Now
[1352.47s -> 1359.30s]  we're going to try as hard as we can now. Yeah, we were just acting for that one. But important,
[1359.30s -> 1365.02s]  folk, we have to make sure that he understands this. You just, did you have, do you have anything,
[1365.02s -> 1369.83s]  you have like stuff in your inventory right now? Yeah. Oh yeah. I need to put in stash, huh? Or
[1369.83s -> 1374.95s]  sell it. Because if you picked up anything that's a chalice or a- Oh yeah. You go to merchants and
[1374.95s -> 1386.87s]  like the chalice stuff is the collector. Yeah. So- What did you say was fast transfer hotkey?
[1386.87s -> 1392.79s]  Is it like a- Oh, shift click is to go from wherever you want to the
[1393.98s -> 1400.25s]  sell window and shift right click puts it in your stash. Ah, shift right click. I was trying to
[1400.25s -> 1404.31s]  shift left click. So if you have any of those little trinkets, you want to sell them because
[1404.31s -> 1407.67s]  that's the way you make gold. That's how you, you sell anything to make money. It's one of the only
[1407.67s -> 1411.59s]  ways, unless you find it or- Okay. I don't want you guys to have to like wait longer. So I'll just
[1411.59s -> 1415.35s]  do the selling stuff. Oh, I'm fine. No, we're good. We're good. Jeremy, you got money, right?
[1415.35s -> 1421.61s]  I've got, yeah, I got money. Go to the goblin merchant. Um, but hold on. I, I'm going to give
[1421.61s -> 1426.23s]  you some guilt armor. If, uh, I stole this from somebody and I have to get rid of it. So I'm going
[1426.23s -> 1432.78s]  to put the sin on you now. What is it? What kind of armor is it? It's purple, uh, ranger armor.
[1432.78s -> 1436.14s]  Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I stole it from somebody and I'm just going to, I'm just moving the guilt
[1436.14s -> 1444.10s]  to you. Okay. Are you okay with that? Yes. All right, cool. Yeah, that's cool. Thank you. Okay.
[1444.10s -> 1448.82s]  I'm going to actually, I'm going to, I'm going to have a good sword this time. I dare you to gamble
[1448.82s -> 1454.74s]  one time. Okay. At the goblin merchant. Does he have anything for sale for you? Yeah, he's got like
[1454.74s -> 1464.36s]  gloves. Uh, I'll try gloves. Do it. I'm not doing that ever again. Oh, okay. Well, I'm ready. Sorry.
[1464.36s -> 1475.61s]  I got like a fucking, like default gloves. Poke, you said that it was going to be awesome. There's
[1475.61s -> 1486.07s]  a chance. Okay. Hold on. So Jim's ceremonial, anything blue? Blue is, is very good. I mean,
[1486.07s -> 1491.42s]  no, no, no, no, sorry. Blue background. That's like, that's like vendor trash. That's stuff you
[1491.42s -> 1501.29s]  can wear. Red background. Like, uh, Jim rings, bangles, goblets, uh, candle holders. Yeah,
[1501.29s -> 1511.05s]  that's the collector. Yeah. The collector, the vendors are spread out in a way where like the,
[1511.05s -> 1516.81s]  you have to sell the gear that would sell to that person. So you can't sell a sword to the guy that
[1516.81s -> 1522.07s]  takes, um, trinkets. It's, uh, okay. Yeah. You have to do it into the right vendor. It'll be like,
[1522.07s -> 1539.78s]  Oh, that vendor doesn't want that item. All right. How do you get rid of like actual trash?
[1539.78s -> 1543.54s]  Just throw it down at the ground. Um, at the end of the, at the beginning of the match.
[1543.54s -> 1548.26s]  Okay. Like if it's, if it's like a gray that is not even worth anything, then you just throw it
[1548.26s -> 1554.63s]  away. You can even sell it to, and it'll just be sell for zero. All right, let's do it. Okay.
[1554.63s -> 1563.69s]  Got something cool for you. Yay. Hey, if you lose it, I'm going to be pissed off by the way.
[1563.69s -> 1575.45s]  Okay. I'm sorry. I'm already sorry. I'm always sorry. All right, let's go. I brought a decent
[1575.45s -> 1588.20s]  weapon this time, so I don't want to, I don't want to blow it. Please get gold bags from the treasure.
[1588.20s -> 1594.90s]  No, I want to, I want it out. I like looking at the coins. Uh, once again,
[1594.90s -> 1598.90s]  I brought no bandages, no potions. I think I'll just take them from your dead body again.
[1598.90s -> 1607.80s]  We worked last time, so that's a good tried and true strap. All right, poke.
[1608.84s -> 1616.89s]  Yo, I got this for you. Look at that. Oh, wait, that's really good. Wow. Don't, don't pick that
[1616.89s -> 1633.06s]  up. Don't pick that up either. It's my old self. All right. Begin the looting. So just break ship
[1633.06s -> 1638.73s]  break, whatever you can break, touch, whatever you can touch, open up, whatever you can open
[1638.73s -> 1649.16s]  the game is, is just pick up everything. Okay. So I'm going to have to, oh, Barians and doors is
[1649.16s -> 1655.40s]  like an awful combo. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's just the weapon you, once you get a felling axe.
[1655.40s -> 1661.58s]  Okay. That's like the best weapon. It's like two zombies, three zombies. Yeah. Some of these,
[1661.58s -> 1668.07s]  some rooms are actually awful. So sometimes they're best to be avoided. We should go straight here.
[1668.07s -> 1679.16s]  We should go straight here. Yeah. I've started down there plenty of times and you just die.
[1679.16s -> 1688.39s]  It just sucks being down there. Oh, this is the worst place. Who can break doors?
[1688.39s -> 1704.50s]  Barbarians. You can eventually, I think you can eventually. But yeah, even like the basic enemies
[1704.50s -> 1712.04s]  are terrifying to me right now. As they should be. Go through here. We go here. That's where we came
[1712.04s -> 1720.06s]  from. Yeah. But we go down. Is it, is it good to like shut doors behind you or? Yeah. Usually.
[1720.06s -> 1731.03s]  Yeah. Oh, careful poke. This guy farts. Oh yeah. He sure does. Is it poison or does it hurt?
[1731.03s -> 1735.69s]  It just hurts when you're in it. That's good. At least I almost just took that in the face.
[1736.33s -> 1741.77s]  Oh, I hear somebody. I'm, I'm being overly cautious right now. Above, above, above.
[1741.77s -> 1764.74s]  Is there somebody in here? I heard somebody. Who's in there? Thank you. Good job. Well done team.
[1764.74s -> 1774.38s]  Ooh. All right. Good call. Good call. Okay. So right click is pretty good in these like narrow
[1774.38s -> 1780.87s]  hallways, I guess. Oh, I hear him. I hear him. Yeah. Wizard. What do you guys, what do you guys
[1780.87s -> 1784.94s]  want to do? I don't know. I'm kind of just like charging unless you guys have stuff to lose that
[1785.50s -> 1793.88s]  run away. Are they up or down? They're up. They're up. Okay. Up mid I think. We can, we can go across
[1793.88s -> 1798.04s]  this. Go for it. Straight ahead behind this big pillar. Uh, west, west, west. Yep. Okay. Are you
[1798.04s -> 1804.38s]  guys friendly? He's doing a fireball. Uh oh. I think the answer is no. You guys want to trade?
[1804.38s -> 1815.51s]  There's people up top though as well. You guys want to trade? Ooh, that hurt. Yeah, that stung.
[1815.51s -> 1832.42s]  Yeah. Watch out. Fireballs hurt. Nice. Got one. One more down here. One guy. Nice. Got two. Got one guy.
[1832.42s -> 1839.19s]  There's missiles coming in from the east. I'm just trying to run around them. I'm going up top.
[1839.19s -> 1847.99s]  I stepped on them. Oh nice. Is there fall damage? Nope. No. All right. That was pretty good. Pretty
[1847.99s -> 1852.95s]  good. One guy, one guy was hiding in this room. He died. Oh, he died? He just died and I killed him.
[1854.39s -> 1860.78s]  No, that's so sad. Oh shit. They had a lot of stuff. All right. We're gonna, all right. I'm not
[1860.78s -> 1864.62s]  gonna. A lot of dead bodies over here. I'm gonna switch those. Hold on. There's like that, there's
[1864.62s -> 1874.98s]  blue axes and shit. Yeah. Can I take the potions? Yeah. So like the best stat on a weapon or anything
[1874.98s -> 1880.39s]  is like all attributes. That's like the god stat. That's like the plus one to all skills for Diablo
[1880.39s -> 1897.91s]  2, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um, so like just leave white weapons or just something's better than
[1897.91s -> 1902.15s]  nothing, I guess? Something is always better than nothing, but if you have, if your inventory is
[1902.15s -> 1910.57s]  full, then you start dropping, you know, grays and all that shit. Trinkets are always worth holding,
[1910.57s -> 1916.89s]  but if you, if you, if you could fit more chalices in your backpack, get rid of like a white weapon,
[1916.89s -> 1928.42s]  right? Yeah. I don't pick up the gray stuff. Usually. All right. I am kind of hurt, but we
[1928.42s -> 1933.54s]  should probably start to. I'm gonna drop some heals right here. Actually I'll use a campfire.
[1933.54s -> 1938.78s]  That's a good idea. Right here. Oh, this is a great time to explain a new mechanic.
[1938.78s -> 1946.58s]  They, they, they buffed campfires, didn't they? Yeah. All right. Come here fast and you press F on
[1946.58s -> 1958.92s]  it and it heals you. Oh, sweet. What a beautiful little camping spot. This is just wait till
[1958.92s -> 1964.09s]  somebody just buries an ax in the back of your head while you're doing this. Okay. What's the
[1964.09s -> 1967.93s]  worst thing that could happen to us right then? Like, is there, is there like a AOE that would
[1967.93s -> 1972.73s]  one shot? I mean, a barbarian with a felling ax, just turning the corner and hitting you once in
[1972.73s -> 1979.72s]  the head. Yeah. Or like a geared mage fireballs. All right. Watch out for this, uh, like, uh,
[1979.72s -> 1988.31s]  E you can use these right here or use a, use a health pot. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you guys hear that?
[1988.31s -> 2004.23s]  Yep. Skeleton up here. I feel like somebody's skeleton here. Nice. Ooh. Who could even use
[2004.23s -> 2009.69s]  this right now? Blue quarterstaff plus one to all attributes. Maybe it's Alex. Maybe. Oh,
[2009.69s -> 2016.36s]  I don't know what any one, any one of you on this, uh, skeleton. Let's take a look at this. Let me
[2016.36s -> 2021.26s]  see. It's a quarterstaff. So it's kind of, they're really, really strong, but they're kind of weird
[2021.26s -> 2029.91s]  to use. Right. Yeah. I haven't really tried it. I heard something over back by me. Sounded
[2029.91s -> 2041.43s]  mechanical. Yeah. It might be a skeleton archer, but let's see. Um, like one 35 just like Diablo
[2041.43s -> 2052.07s]  bat chest. Hey, it's Alex. Do you remember, do you remember Diablo two? Oh, Diablo two. You're
[2052.07s -> 2059.26s]  going to freaking love this game. I remember the greatest ARPG that's ever been made and never been
[2059.26s -> 2069.32s]  duplicated except by the remaster Diablo two. I loved it too. It's probably one of the best games
[2069.32s -> 2081.75s]  of all time. The blue portal. Ooh. All right. Who wants to get out of here? Oh, you got the, that
[2081.75s -> 2088.76s]  purple and, but Alex, what do you got? Um, my best is a, the blue quarterstaff and a green Marauder
[2088.76s -> 2096.36s]  outfit. And that's it. I just hover near it. Wait for three. Yeah. You should definitely take it
[2096.36s -> 2101.96s]  though, because you, you, you probably have the least amount of stuff and money. Are you saying
[2101.96s -> 2105.88s]  I'm poor? I, yeah, I would definitely take it. You should just get out of here. Why, why the lights
[2105.88s -> 2109.72s]  off here? Hey, wait, wait, wait. Actually, before you go there, like just honestly, like just take
[2109.72s -> 2117.18s]  all this. Oh dude, money. Just take everything and then get out, get the hell out of here. You
[2117.18s -> 2121.91s]  know what? Fucking take this too. You know what? Just take everything. I don't have that much
[2121.91s -> 2129.03s]  space. Just fucking take everything I want. Go, go, get out of here. Hurry. Oh, someone's here. Hey,
[2129.03s -> 2134.60s]  are you friendly? You gotta, you gotta get out of here. I'm going. Hey, we can talk. I'm not gonna
[2134.60s -> 2139.00s]  hurt you. People are getting naked in here. I could have killed you right there. I'm friendly, man. Hey,
[2139.00s -> 2144.34s]  what's up? What's going on? Hey, watch out. Watch out for the trap, man. Watch out. There's a trap
[2144.34s -> 2161.13s]  here. I want the goblet. Someone's coming. This game is crazy, man. Did you not put any of your
[2161.13s -> 2172.26s]  armor back on? No. Okay. Who's taking it? I, it should be you. I have literally nothing.
[2172.90s -> 2182.36s]  I gave everything to italics and he left. No. No? We find two. We find two? No, you know,
[2182.36s -> 2191.85s]  you get out of here. Right here, right here. Are you good? Did you make it? No, I'm gonna find one.
[2191.85s -> 2197.45s]  No, no, you have way better stuff than I do. I threw all my stuff to italics. I'm already,
[2197.45s -> 2203.35s]  I'm already there. All right, I'm going in. Oh, there's a, I didn't realize there was actually
[2203.35s -> 2214.89s]  like a kill feed. Oh, there's one down the hall. Oak, you have to survive with the guilt armor.
[2214.89s -> 2233.70s]  That's true. He's eating beef jerky. Oh, damn. Oh, that was close. Well, that was fun, though.
[2234.34s -> 2239.18s]  I have a lot of weapons. I want to get rid of it. Hey, that was guilt armor anyways. Hey, I'm,
[2239.18s -> 2245.66s]  I'm two for two, but that's only because you let me go this time. So now honestly, being able to
[2245.66s -> 2251.02s]  leave and make a little bit of money is just, you can buy potions and ban it. You, you're going to
[2251.02s -> 2264.92s]  need it. Stash is coming together here. Yep. Can you, uh, sell the merchants directly from the stash?
[2266.55s -> 2270.63s]  I don't know. Oh yeah. You can sell, you don't have to put it in your stash. You can just sell
[2270.63s -> 2275.11s]  it from your bag too. Yeah. But like, if you have stuff in your stash, can you sell from that?
[2275.11s -> 2281.40s]  Yeah, you can. Well, you, you can just sell right from your stash. I didn't know that. That's cool.
[2282.65s -> 2288.41s]  You mean just like from the stash window or no? You have to like actually be in the merchant window.
[2288.41s -> 2294.78s]  I meant like, uh, be in the merchant window, but stash open. Yeah. On the right side, you can see
[2294.78s -> 2311.54s]  little stash button. Oh yeah. You can play stuff in stash. Blue throwing axes. Is that even worth,
[2311.54s -> 2315.94s]  like you can't, can you recover thrown weapons? Nope. They are, they are just a consumable,
[2315.94s -> 2327.93s]  but they're very, very good if you get good ones. All right. I'm good to just to rock back in when
[2327.93s -> 2335.50s]  you guys are ready. I'm in. Okay. One second. Should I, should I like buy, um, like heal potion
[2335.50s -> 2343.08s]  or anything? It's good practice to have and don't get scammed because there is, there's two versions
[2343.08s -> 2347.86s]  that come in batches of three. One is insanely expensive for not very much more healing. That's
[2347.86s -> 2354.34s]  only due to that if you're very wealthy, but like the, the cheaper one that's three is usually good
[2354.34s -> 2362.31s]  to have. Oh, what perk do you have E? Um, I just got level two. So can I pick a perk? Yeah. Go to,
[2362.31s -> 2378.60s]  go to class and Perk and Skill. So 18 gold for the three stack is good, uh, potions? Uh, yeah. It's
[2378.60s -> 2386.73s]  not bad. It's always a good practice to have three of the default potion and three bandages if you
[2386.73s -> 2393.94s]  can afford it. Okay. So, um, I'm on the perk page. Yeah. You go to perk and skill and then you,
[2393.94s -> 2403.40s]  you see that available perk you have, or the one perk you have on? Oh yeah. Two-handed weapon
[2403.40s -> 2409.90s]  expert. Yeah. Maybe you should just get the, um, the one that lets you break through walls and shit.
[2409.90s -> 2416.10s]  I like that one. That's like the best perk in my opinion. Uh, smash unreinforced doors and containers
[2418.04s -> 2423.50s]  and defeat blocks and parries. Yeah. You should get that one. Just get that one. And I'm going to
[2423.50s -> 2429.74s]  bring you, I'm going to bring you a, just a, just a normal axe. You'll have a lot more fun with it.
[2429.74s -> 2436.54s]  Yeah. Barbarian with the axe is, uh, barbarian with an axe is disgusting. It's fun just bopping
[2436.54s -> 2443.93s]  people in the head with, um, two shots. Especially if you get like a purple
[2443.93s -> 2448.25s]  felling axe or something. It's just, you can kill somebody in one hit. I got him a white one for now.
[2448.25s -> 2455.21s]  Yep. So you can have what, like four perks at a time at level 15? Yeah. Okay. Oh, and you should,
[2455.21s -> 2461.13s]  I'm just the question asker on the, I am like the audience POV. Like people, people are like tuning
[2461.13s -> 2465.72s]  into the streams and be like, I don't know what this game is. And I'm them. I'm just asking questions
[2465.72s -> 2470.98s]  for them. Hey, you have to learn somewhere. You should replace your second ability with the
[2470.98s -> 2479.45s]  battle shout one or the one that like, uh, fears everything. That one is really good.
[2479.45s -> 2482.49s]  You keep the one that gives you strength and the one that gives you the fear. Uh,
[2482.49s -> 2487.16s]  7.5 meter radius physical damage. Yeah. That one, that one's bussing. It's super good.
[2487.16s -> 2490.65s]  Yeah. That one, it's like a stun almost essentially. Yeah. You just walk in a room
[2490.65s -> 2496.86s]  and anything that hits you, like the mobs, you just stop them. It's really good. Okay. I'm ready.
[2496.86s -> 2504.33s]  Is war cry any good? Uh, the max HP buff? Uh, I think the ability, I think the attack bar one's
[2504.33s -> 2515.26s]  better. Yeah. The one that gives you strength is good. Okay. All right. Let's go. And by the way,
[2515.26s -> 2544.25s]  to all the stream snipers, three, two, one, let's go for it. That's very kind of you. Yeah. So you
[2544.25s -> 2551.51s]  said there's like three maps right now in the demo. There's a solo map. There's a team map. And then
[2551.51s -> 2557.34s]  is the high roller map a different map or is that the same as the regular map, but just harder?
[2557.34s -> 2563.59s]  Yeah. The same as, uh, the same one, but harder. I'm willing to pay for it if we want to do it.
[2563.59s -> 2571.40s]  We should do it. It's fun. It's hard. Okay. Yeah. We should do it. All right. Here's your acts.
[2571.40s -> 2578.07s]  Yo, did this acts like, Oh, wait, you, you got out. Oh no. Wait, what? I forgot. You didn't die.
[2578.07s -> 2582.39s]  Yeah. I didn't die. Yeah. But just try that one. You'll love it. But what about the greens?
[2584.90s -> 2590.47s]  See what you like. Honestly, like swings down, not side to side. So it's easier. It's so much
[2590.47s -> 2596.20s]  better that, Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh no. You're not using the acts for the felling one. The felling
[2596.20s -> 2602.55s]  one is like the felling one. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, I give you, I give you a felling acts.
[2602.55s -> 2608.49s]  That one is like, this is what I just picked up off the ground. Oh, I just got hit by that.
[2608.49s -> 2615.75s]  Shit. I didn't give you a, wait, what is it? This is the acts that I was dropped.
[2615.75s -> 2620.71s]  This apparently I gave you the wrong battle. Like you're, you just tried to like scam me,
[2620.71s -> 2626.71s]  like gaslighting you beautiful acts. I'll give it to you for the little price of a hundred gold.
[2626.79s -> 2633.75s]  It's a felling acts. Did I really buy a white ass? Wait, you bought, you bought that? No, no, no.
[2633.75s -> 2639.56s]  It was like 20 bucks. Oh, it's that bad. Oh, I'm so sorry. That's okay. Oh, we got people. Oh,
[2639.56s -> 2653.38s]  people up there. Um, let me squeeze in here and fart people on top of us. And there's a,
[2653.38s -> 2656.82s]  there's an archer. There's a, there's multiple skeleton archers and they're awful. They don't
[2656.82s -> 2662.17s]  miss. And the regular archer shooting. And the trick is you crouch before they hit you.
[2662.97s -> 2668.10s]  I just hold the shield up like archers coming down and archers trying to shoot me.
[2673.74s -> 2677.26s]  Oh, this, oh, the skeleton archer. Yeah. There's an archer up top on the, on the balcony though.
[2677.26s -> 2686.74s]  Yeah. He ran away. He closed the door. Nice. Good. So there, there are like cleaves in this game,
[2686.74s -> 2692.26s]  right? Yeah. You can, yeah, you can, you can swing and hit everything. Okay. I'm, I'm asking more
[2692.26s -> 2699.37s]  for friendly fire than for anything else. Yeah. You can, you can hit people with a huge, it's like
[2699.37s -> 2709.77s]  180 degrees in front of you essentially if you hold it down. Oops. These little bats, these bats
[2709.77s -> 2717.94s]  are my favorite to kill because they drop, uh, amulets and stuff. I hear arrows. Oh, this is
[2717.94s -> 2726.63s]  yours. Uh, there is a green, uh, armor here. Resourcefulness. Who should, who strength and
[2726.63s -> 2733.10s]  resourcefulness? Uh, Alex, you should take these. These are green. They got strength and resourcefulness
[2733.10s -> 2741.50s]  on them. I'm going to drop them for you over here. Probably best in your hands. Okay. On the ground
[2741.50s -> 2759.64s]  in front of me. Got them. Yeah. The hardest part right now is just learning like weapon range
[2759.64s -> 2764.81s]  and, uh, where the tip of the, you know, a lot of random shit. I found one for you.
[2764.81s -> 2772.90s]  What do you got? Look at that. Head down, ass up. Everybody loot. Same time. Let's go. Oh,
[2772.90s -> 2781.46s]  shit. Yeah. Hey, E. Hey, what up? Hey, E. Hey, what up? Oh, and here, uh, German for your head,
[2781.46s -> 2790.30s]  your haircut. Oh, wow. A warm all. Does that mean my haircut's bad? Talk later. Is this
[2790.62s -> 2801.82s]  your haircut? So there's like a three attack progression for every weapon. Yeah. Everything
[2801.82s -> 2807.86s]  has a three chain. Uh, I think so. When do you queue up the second swing? I know it's just stupid.
[2807.86s -> 2814.60s]  Uh, hold it. Baby questions. You just hold it. If it's not in a row, it will not chain together.
[2814.60s -> 2819.00s]  Okay. So you could do click and then click, or you could just hold. Holding is probably a little
[2819.00s -> 2825.06s]  easier because then you can let it go when you don't want to swing it third time. This campfire
[2825.06s -> 2837.19s]  for us. I'm a campfire for us. Why not? So what did they change with the campfire? This heals more
[2837.19s -> 2844.90s]  or something. I think it's just longer. Oh, come over here. Yeah, I'm coming. Movement.
[2844.90s -> 2858.31s]  Oh, movement. Oh, shit. Behind me. Behind me. Ah. Up the stairs as well. Stairs. Behind you.
[2858.31s -> 2873.66s]  Folk behind you. Okay. I'm running back a little bit. They flanked us. Yeah, they did. They come
[2873.66s -> 2887.59s]  through. They come through. Oh, that hurt. Oh, I almost just hit you guys. He's gotta be low.
[2888.23s -> 2894.17s]  Oh, the archer got me. The archer got me. That, that, the, the, the two hitters probably low.
[2894.17s -> 2901.29s]  Fighters probably low. He's coming in with a peeling potion. I'm almost dead. Yeah. I can't
[2901.29s -> 2909.27s]  hit shit with this mall. I'm so afraid of that archer. This is so Scott. The archer will kill,
[2909.27s -> 2919.72s]  the archer will kill. Yo. Oh, I thought I killed him. Fuck. I can't hit. The range on this mall is
[2919.72s -> 2924.68s]  dog shit. Yeah. Oh my God. I had healing potions in my fucking inventory. I didn't even, I forgot
[2924.68s -> 2930.02s]  I bought them. I thought, oh shit. I'm an idiot. Don't even blame yourself. The mall is just like
[2930.02s -> 2939.64s]  the axe. I'll buy you one right now. I got you a felling axe. Okay. I had every swing. I had six
[2939.64s -> 2950.23s]  potions and I didn't even drink one. I did drink a potion, but they heal like 10%. Hey, we're just
[2950.23s -> 2958.98s]  warming up. We're warming up. Come on. That was my first death in this game. You know what? You know
[2958.98s -> 2964.30s]  what it is? A lot of times I don't buy anything because I go, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to
[2964.30s -> 2969.54s]  fucking lose it. I'm not buying shit. I'm just going for it. And then when you actually do buy shit,
[2969.54s -> 2978.86s]  it's, you just forget that you did that. Okay. I'm going to remember, I'm buying it. I'm buying it
[2978.86s -> 2985.35s]  right now. This is like fighting in a dream. You're like stuck in quicksand. You can't move.
[2987.62s -> 2994.12s]  Everything's heavy. Shit. I take the L on that one. I could have fucking healed. No, no, no, no,
[2994.12s -> 3007.91s]  I tricked us with the food. I was working for them. Bye. You know what? I don't even care if I lose
[3007.91s -> 3014.01s]  it. I'm bringing out the big, I'm bringing out the big gun. How's the, um, the quarterstaff?
[3014.01s -> 3022.62s]  Quarterstaff is fun to use. It's just, it has like a swing down, then you swing the bottom part up.
[3022.62s -> 3028.78s]  So it has like a swing down animation, then like a swing up animation. All right. Put,
[3028.78s -> 3038.54s]  put a value on like just the average green or blue or like higher quality in terms of like gold.
[3038.54s -> 3044.86s]  Blues are worth a lot more than, than greens, I would say. Like you talk about like, like how
[3044.86s -> 3049.82s]  much it, like to sell it. Yeah. Like, uh, like whether or not you want to, ooh, should I go
[3049.82s -> 3055.18s]  win with this and risk losing it? Like what's, what's the gold value of? I mean, the blues are
[3055.18s -> 3059.98s]  gonna, they, they can carry you through a run. If you have like a good blue weapon or like a good
[3059.98s -> 3065.42s]  three or four blues on for equipment, you're going to take a lot less damage. Yeah. But if you like
[3065.42s -> 3073.75s]  die with one, how much money did you lose? Oh, like maybe 40 gold, 30 gold for like a couple of
[3073.75s -> 3079.91s]  items. Maybe they sell for like what? 10 to 20, a lot of times 15. Okay. I got you a weapon. Okay.
[3079.91s -> 3085.61s]  I got you weapon E. It's good. Sick. All right. I'm coming in with my purple sword. I got a purple
[3086.25s -> 3094.02s]  and I am not around this time. I am so angry. Oh, get, get pissed off. Get angry. Cause this is how
[3094.02s -> 3098.18s]  we're going to, I'm so mad. I'm ready. You don't sound that mad to me. I don't know if we can do
[3098.18s -> 3110.34s]  it. I'm buying some potions. Get angry. I'm tense. How do you swap between, um, number four? Uh,
[3110.34s -> 3123.74s]  you just hit four. All right. I'm ready. I'm going to, if I lose my purple, I lose my purple boat.
[3123.74s -> 3126.62s]  I'm not going to, cause we're going to destroy. I'm going to find you purples. We're going to
[3126.62s -> 3131.83s]  find purples. I'm just glad I haven't killed either of you yet. Outside of not killing the
[3131.83s -> 3141.05s]  guys who killed you first. Hey, what'd you say? Did you hear the voice in the loading screen?
[3141.05s -> 3151.48s]  I was at you. Yeah. Oh, I like how you can still talk in the loading screen like a little bit.
[3151.48s -> 3156.78s]  All right. I'm trying as hard as I can now. You say you brought a purple in.
[3156.78s -> 3160.38s]  I have a purple weapon. I can kill Mo. If I hit somebody in the head, I can kill them in one or
[3160.38s -> 3165.50s]  two hits. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah. Boom. Boom. Now that attack
[3165.50s -> 3174.78s]  animation is good as hell. Heck hell. Try it out. Yep. Uh, poke. I, I, you might, you probably
[3174.78s -> 3179.35s]  didn't know. I, I don't really, like if you're going to say like a swear or something, can you
[3179.35s -> 3184.79s]  say like, like a crap or, Oh, I know. I was pretending I couldn't. Oh, that stinks. Like you
[3184.79s -> 3188.54s]  should have, I don't know. I just, maybe next time just be better about it if you can. Oh,
[3188.54s -> 3193.22s]  okay. Sorry about that. Yeah. It's all right. Just, you know, so there's, you know, is the
[3193.22s -> 3202.55s]  felling acts like a single attack? Yeah. Okay. Just hit their heads. Yep. Click on heads. Oh,
[3202.55s -> 3215.11s]  fountain of speed. Yeah. I don't want to hit you with this. So this just makes you run faster,
[3215.11s -> 3225.42s]  right? What does fountain of speed? Yeah, it does. You should probably take this shit then.
[3225.42s -> 3234.86s]  Yeah. Um, Alex, you take grief. Oh, me trying protection. I'll take this. Oh, that,
[3236.20s -> 3239.96s]  what am I supposed to take this little fountain? Oh, that's my, yeah, the speed, the speed fountain
[3239.96s -> 3251.91s]  because it makes you run faster. You should take that. I am slow as shit. What do you think we
[3251.91s -> 3262.33s]  should go this way? I guess so. Should I just be using abilities more often? Like you want to run
[3262.33s -> 3266.49s]  in the middle there right there and use your E, go in the middle there, use your E or your other Q
[3266.49s -> 3284.22s]  or your, your other one. Oh, people there, people across. Yep. Mage behind me. Mage. Yep. He needs
[3284.22s -> 3301.88s]  like one hit. Got one. Got one. This guy's really low running away. Oh, there's a guy, 195. Oh,
[3301.88s -> 3307.35s]  that's, you do play those games. Oh my God. Thank you for saying that. Yeah. He's like, he's not,
[3307.35s -> 3313.37s]  he's really hurt. I got him. I got him. He's dead. Okay. Let's go. Good shit guys. All right. I
[3313.37s -> 3321.06s]  didn't kill shit, but I got one call out. So I'll take the assist. Anybody need health? Uh,
[3321.78s -> 3326.50s]  I can. Hey, we won that fight. Yeah, it was good. All right. Good fight. Good fight. Nice job.
[3326.50s -> 3336.14s]  Listen, I'm at a disadvantage. I have to do a new weapon every game. So I'm learning every single,
[3336.14s -> 3341.03s]  uh, I think you're doing great. Do you want some, uh, some advantages or healing potions to Alex?
[3341.03s -> 3344.95s]  Uh, I got two left and there's three on this guy. Yeah. You should take, you should take one.
[3344.95s -> 3348.47s]  Yeah. You always want to be topped off. Yeah. You want to be close to like 90%
[3348.47s -> 3353.43s]  can be because it's so easy to die from like one hit in the head that if you could survive too,
[3353.43s -> 3358.90s]  then you might kill the other person bandages versus potions. Just bandages are small potions.
[3358.90s -> 3364.34s]  Basically. Yeah. Just use a potion and then use a bandage on after that. I got a campfire as well.
[3364.34s -> 3371.74s]  We need it also potion of protection. Like these right here, I'm dropping one. You always want to
[3371.74s -> 3376.95s]  pop that before a fight. It's like, it's really, really helpful. Uh, there's a tracker box just
[3377.51s -> 3393.10s]  30. Oh, fine. Oh yeah. It's two, two people. We both just did the same thing. Trying to throw
[3393.10s -> 3402.63s]  axes. Okay. There he goes. His buddy's over here somewhere at a 15 down the hall. West is the other
[3402.63s -> 3416.63s]  one. Yep. He's got a potion. I killed this guy. Yep. This guy's just way throwing his old stuff.
[3416.63s -> 3422.39s]  Careful. Uh, don't engage too much, which we're all here cause he could just hit you once in the head.
[3422.39s -> 3439.74s]  He's got that potion. Nice. Oh, that's barely. Mine came down a half second before his.
[3439.74s -> 3447.66s]  I'm gonna use a campfire right here. Okay. Yeah. For you guys. Now it's good to take them both.
[3447.66s -> 3455.96s]  Use your heals guys. These are solo. I just drank one. Drank one bandaging. Drop that health pot for
[3455.96s -> 3466.41s]  you too. That's two different groups. We're doing all right. We are rolling right now. We are rolling
[3466.41s -> 3476.02s]  them. I killed the archer too. Grab that potion. Yep. Yeah. You got the archer too. That's huge.
[3476.02s -> 3481.94s]  Getting skunked off these potions right now. I dropped another health pot for you guys.
[3481.94s -> 3490.10s]  Oh my God. This morning star. No cleric though. Make sure you guys fully heal and then move
[3490.10s -> 3494.52s]  forward. I'm just trying to take a shoot on this. There's a pendant on them too. There's a good
[3494.52s -> 3503.11s]  pendant on them. Oh, physical healing. Cool. I'll take it. All right. I got the killing blow. I
[3503.11s -> 3506.79s]  don't have any, I'm taking the loot. Yeah. Take as much of that as you want. Go crazy. I'm just
[3506.79s -> 3510.55s]  kidding. I don't, I don't really care. We gotta go crazy. Go crazy man. We gotta move too. We gotta
[3510.55s -> 3521.18s]  move. Okay. Those are good. Those are good. Helmet. Good. Circles coming. Also as a barbarian,
[3521.18s -> 3528.41s]  you have these like throwing axes. Yeah. They're really good. It slows them too. It's really good.
[3528.41s -> 3535.85s]  Did you get the morning star off that person? Uh. I'm gonna. Oh, you got it? Yeah. No,
[3535.85s -> 3545.78s]  just sell it. You can just sell it. All right. Let's move. All right. Oil lanterns explode.
[3545.78s -> 3550.49s]  Oil lanterns sell for a shit load of money by the way. Yeah, I sell them. It's good money.
[3550.49s -> 3564.66s]  They sell for like 25 gold each. Can't move. I am. I think I've bugged my character.
[3565.38s -> 3570.06s]  What's wrong? Never mind. Never mind. Never mind. There's an F to cancel so you don't throw.
[3570.06s -> 3574.70s]  Oh yeah. You have to like. You can't like switch weapons or do anything else. The game is a little
[3574.70s -> 3578.38s]  buggy. Sometimes you'll swing and you won't swing and sometimes you'll just keep swinging for no
[3578.38s -> 3585.75s]  reason. Yeah. Happens to me a lot. We should probably start to look for a way out. Like we
[3585.75s -> 3606.47s]  should probably generally try to get out of here. Yeah. It should be popping up now. Kind of good.
[3606.47s -> 3611.91s]  Oh, shoes for you if you want those shoes. Oh shit. Those are good.
[3614.68s -> 3626.68s]  Should go this way. Okay. It's sneak to the right here. Don't do aggro.
[3626.68s -> 3636.18s]  Yeah. This room is hell. Yep. Yeah. This room seriously is where it's like so many people die.
[3636.18s -> 3644.82s]  That Wraith that that's like a boss. Yeah. I see green eye entities. Yep. That's a more confidence
[3644.82s -> 3647.70s]  room. I don't know if we have that at the moment. I got to get used to the range on these.
[3650.84s -> 3659.46s]  This Y hander really was like training weights in terms of reach. Yeah. Watch out through the
[3659.46s -> 3668.22s]  hole here on the right. Oh my God. I'm sad. I don't want to swing because it's a horizontal
[3668.22s -> 3672.46s]  swing and I will hit one of you in the head with this insanely powerful weapon. Yeah.
[3673.26s -> 3678.12s]  I would feel so awful about it. So I'm just not going to do it. It'd be funny though.
[3678.12s -> 3686.28s]  It would. I would be very, very funny. All right. Shit's on his weight around here.
[3686.28s -> 3702.84s]  Spun up soon. Oh, be careful here. Whoa. What was that? What happened? What happened?
[3702.84s -> 3706.36s]  You got hit in the back by the pendulum. Oh, I thought there were only two.
[3706.36s -> 3713.16s]  Oh, shit. What the fuck is happening? I thought it was only three heels. I got heels. I think
[3713.16s -> 3716.92s]  I thought it was three. I didn't even know the other one was moving.
[3717.56s -> 3723.48s]  I've never seen four. I've only seen three. Oh, God. Escape at the end of it.
[3724.04s -> 3730.73s]  There's one there. Hey, hey, boys. I'm just saying I'm fucking out of here. Yeah, go for it.
[3731.69s -> 3742.15s]  Here, take the shit. I'll open it for you. Appreciate it. All right. Yeah. Here's something else.
[3742.71s -> 3747.08s]  Good luck. Have fun. We should be able to find one right here.
[3747.08s -> 3760.17s]  Just in case there's a fight. I just want to make sure. All right. Good luck. Be careful here.
[3760.17s -> 3763.77s]  All right. Take it before I do. Yeah. I've dropped those on the ground.
[3763.77s -> 3769.35s]  I dropped healing on the ground for you. Oh, there's three next to me. Oh, nice. Yeah.
[3769.35s -> 3776.17s]  Get out, get out, get out. Oh, nice. One of them's slightly more dangerous. I'll take the
[3776.17s -> 3784.30s]  I'll take the dangerous one already. Hell yeah. That was a good one. That's a clean one. Nice.
[3784.30s -> 3792.39s]  Good job, guys. Oh, yeah. And we killed like two groups also when we got looted.
[3794.41s -> 3803.69s]  Yeah, that worked out pretty well. I feel good about that one. Okay. Since we're cocky as hell,
[3806.10s -> 3812.66s]  we should do a high roller for fun. All right. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. It's very scary.
[3813.14s -> 3817.94s]  Yeah. So whatever, the ship wipes in two days anyway. Yeah. For just let's go to labs.
[3817.94s -> 3823.35s]  Do we all have to pay for it? It's a hundred. So collect a hundred, get a lot of heals,
[3823.35s -> 3829.43s]  just get a lot of the cheap heals, get the healing potions and the alchemist, the bandages. Okay.
[3829.43s -> 3834.57s]  We got this. Okay. All right. Let's get scary. It's going to be scary. Yeah. Let's take a second.
[3834.57s -> 3841.64s]  Make sure you got all your shit or you got what you want. We'll go for it. Okay. Let me do this.
[3841.64s -> 3845.48s]  I just wanted to say that thanks to you, I have a seventy five percent survival
[3845.48s -> 3849.80s]  rate in this game, which I think is you're really going to mess up our matchmaking.
[3849.80s -> 3864.63s]  I don't think there even is matchmaking. Cool. All right. So, okay. So collector is all the
[3864.63s -> 3878.41s]  goblets and stuff. I don't even know who all the merchants are and buy a shitload of potions.
[3879.05s -> 3893.02s]  Oh, how much would you how much should we get? How many stacks of potions like three? I think
[3893.02s -> 3908.81s]  I'm going to fill an entire slot with potions. Oh, I can't buy that. Any of you guys need gloves?
[3909.80s -> 3917.18s]  I don't have a hundred gold yet, but hold on. If you sell everything, I'm working on it.
[3917.18s -> 3923.22s]  Yeah. I'm buying this whole stock of potions. Is that stupid? The thing was I'm so poor that
[3923.22s -> 3931.70s]  I spent thirty six gold just on like heals in the last two counters. We can do one more normal
[3931.70s -> 3937.27s]  if you want. I think I'm ready for it. Let's let's go. Let's do a high roll. Let's do it.
[3937.27s -> 3944.07s]  By the way, oil lanterns really do sell for twenty. I don't know why they sell for so much.
[3944.07s -> 3957.03s]  That's crazy. How do you stack? Is it like a is it like a wallet? Yes. You buy the gold coin
[3957.03s -> 3967.24s]  purses and then go. Oh, of course. So should I just be selling like all the extra armor and weapons
[3967.24s -> 3974.90s]  and stuff vendor or like should I save those for player market or what? Anything that you. Yeah.
[3974.90s -> 3978.34s]  Anything that you get that's like blue or better, especially if it's purple,
[3978.34s -> 3984.31s]  if it's for the wrong class. I mean, trading it is how you I mean, selling it was probably
[3984.31s -> 3991.10s]  not a great idea because you can just trade it to another player. But I mean, at this stage in the
[3991.10s -> 3996.46s]  demo, I would just just sell everything and keep some stuff. If you have another character you
[3996.46s -> 4000.38s]  want to play with, then you can do sort of the oh, I'm going to go in a game and drop this on
[4000.38s -> 4006.57s]  the ground. Please give it to my ranger when I make it right. But I haven't done any trading or
[4006.57s -> 4024.73s]  anything. I'm just kind of playing. I am going to do this, though. I gambled again. You said oil
[4024.73s -> 4031.08s]  lanterns are pretty good to sell. Yep. They were twenty three. Who's the who's the weapon guy?
[4031.08s -> 4048.90s]  The weapon guy. OK. Yeah. OK. I am. OK. I am ready to try this hard mode.
[4048.90s -> 4060.44s]  Got a ton of heels. I got a full set of gear. It's pretty good stuff. I think I'm ready. All
[4060.44s -> 4067.70s]  right. I'm ready. How do you get the high roller ticket or what do you have to do to get in? I
[4067.70s -> 4073.56s]  think I just have to pay for it. Oh, OK. So it's like, are we ready to fight robots? We all take
[4073.56s -> 4079.38s]  a hundred. Everybody has to pay. Do you have a hundred gold? I just got. Yeah, I just traded up
[4079.38s -> 4087.94s]  to it. How about this? We die. If we die, we go into the normal with nothing and go zero to hero.
[4087.94s -> 4093.83s]  Yeah, that's good. I think I have like one hundred and thirty eight gold and some silver. Perfect.
[4093.83s -> 4098.55s]  All right, let's do it. You ready? Everybody get your money. Get you get your wallet out.
[4098.55s -> 4107.85s]  We're splitting this check three ways. OK, if you bring a second weapon, does that like weigh you
[4107.85s -> 4116.25s]  down like you're slower? I think it's only if you've equipped. OK, so like a primary secondary is
[4116.25s -> 4125.00s]  fine to have. Yeah, if you have primaries, but I just make sure it's not equipped. If you don't
[4125.00s -> 4129.24s]  remind me to ignore you earlier, I had to go pee, but I didn't want to say I want to have to go pee.
[4129.24s -> 4138.38s]  You know what I'm saying? When you ignored me, when did you ignore me? Yeah, I didn't. I'm so sorry.
[4138.38s -> 4142.06s]  You didn't do it. You didn't do anything in this stream. What do you call it? I'm ready.
[4142.06s -> 4146.62s]  You don't have to apologize for anything. You didn't do anything wrong. All right. You ready?
[4146.62s -> 4153.11s]  I won't do it again. I just read your message. Yeah, whatever you're doing. Yeah. What?
[4157.38s -> 4168.28s]  All right. I'm president. Oh, here we go. So like with the felling axe, I feel like I have
[4168.28s -> 4173.80s]  to get danger close to anything to hit. Kind of. But it hits the head really hard, though. OK.
[4173.80s -> 4179.11s]  You know what I'm saying? Yeah, just got to click on the head faster. But how do we close the gap
[4179.11s -> 4187.51s]  when they're faster than me? So there's like, I rebind my holster to like mouse button.
[4187.51s -> 4191.91s]  That's a good idea. I just, I holster all the time when I'm running to people. And if you jump
[4191.91s -> 4197.11s]  and holster in the air, you like, there's like some tech to it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah,
[4197.11s -> 4204.44s]  yeah. Like CS, CS go jumping. Oh, we got, we got gambler. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. So we got,
[4204.44s -> 4210.18s]  we got some, we got gambler. If only, if one of us survives, people are betting on it. All right.
[4210.18s -> 4218.07s]  Let's see. Only one of us has to survive this. Good luck, believers and non-believers, except
[4218.07s -> 4239.29s]  non-believers, you fucked up. I'm just saying you fucked up. I'm a high roller. I didn't get it in
[4239.29s -> 4250.98s]  time. Oh, they heard that. Oh, they did. Yeah, they heard nothing but, oh fuck. I don't even have a
[4250.98s -> 4263.32s]  torso piece. I'm, I'm, I'm taking this to the next level here. So is this a different map poke or is
[4263.32s -> 4266.60s]  this the same one, but just everything's harder? There's a chance to get a Colosseum map, but
[4266.60s -> 4273.32s]  usually it's the same map. Okay. Um, the rebind didn't work. Okay. No, listen, listen, listen. Oh
[4273.32s -> 4281.26s]  God, every monster moves faster and they're scary. What? Oh my God. It does move so fast. I missed.
[4281.26s -> 4292.15s]  Okay. We did that. That was so fast. Ooh. Oh my God. I had a ring. The loot is a lot better. Wow.
[4292.15s -> 4300.33s]  All right. This is cool. All right. I'm just going to follow you. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4300.33s -> 4307.74s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. I learned this today. Yeah. Listen, there's a way to kill this boss without
[4307.74s -> 4314.30s]  taking damage. So I'm going to try it. Okay. Oh, I'm going this way. I'm going this way. Wish me luck.
[4316.04s -> 4323.53s]  High roller. Let's go without taking any damage. Oh, people across. They're coming. Get the, get
[4323.53s -> 4329.34s]  out of here, buddy. Are you friendly? Oh, okay. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh,
[4329.34s -> 4333.50s]  nevermind. Run, run, run. This guy aggroed the whole world. Oh, you do. You aggroed everything.
[4333.50s -> 4341.34s]  What are you doing? We're high rollers. In this door. Oh my God. He just brought everything over
[4341.34s -> 4348.31s]  here. Close them out. Close, close, close, close, close. State your name. We're good. We're good.
[4348.31s -> 4356.52s]  State your name. What's your, what's your name? Name is Ethan. I'm Ethan. Okay. Ethan, you look
[4356.52s -> 4362.49s]  like you got a lot of good shit. No, I'm, I came in here with grace. I came in here with grace.
[4362.49s -> 4372.47s]  Okay. All right. You can live. Hey, it's better to have four than three. Which one do you use?
[4373.27s -> 4379.34s]  Huh? Shout out the substream. Shout out the substream. It's for you. This is for you.
[4383.99s -> 4393.93s]  Oh, okay. Now I see his name. If Poke just couldn't take the shout out, he couldn't take like the
[4393.93s -> 4397.29s]  fucking shout out. No, no, no. I thought he was going to say something bad or something.
[4398.97s -> 4403.13s]  He's like, I got my moment. Oh, you thought, you thought he was going to just start screaming
[4403.13s -> 4408.89s]  wicked awful shit. Oh, that's true. All right. Yeah. You met. Yep. Yep. Which one's Jerma?
[4408.89s -> 4419.29s]  I was like, wait, what? That's true. That's true. I got scared. It's like, I don't know. I don't
[4419.29s -> 4425.43s]  know. Oh my God. Uh, you know what? Like, like good on you though. Like appreciate it looking
[4425.43s -> 4430.33s]  out. I'm sorry. You're looking out for us. That's, that's good. Sorry, Ethan. Yeah. He thought, he
[4430.33s -> 4433.61s]  thought you're going to scream a bunch of terrible things into the mic. The developer just messaged
[4433.61s -> 4441.13s]  me and said, we can't group up with four or so. All right. Hard jump. Uh huh. I missed it.
[4442.01s -> 4448.54s]  God damn it. I'm actually so fucking mad because I'm dead down here. Do not be like me. Make that
[4448.54s -> 4454.47s]  jump. I'll make it over. There's a boss following me. Yeah. Oh wait, you can jump up here. Other
[4454.47s -> 4459.96s]  players, other players coming across. No, they're not friendly. What do I go from here? I forget
[4459.96s -> 4468.42s]  this whole map. Uh, you gotta come back. We're friendly. We're friendly. Come. Who the fuck is
[4468.42s -> 4474.82s]  this guy? That's like, he's in the party with the guy you just said is friendly. All right. We're
[4474.82s -> 4486.42s]  good. Wait, is this your, are you all teammates? Who is this? Who are you? Yes. You a high roller?
[4486.42s -> 4492.97s]  I am your communion. Drink from me. Are you a high roller or are you, what are you? I'm like stuck.
[4494.01s -> 4502.15s]  Here comes the wall. What did he say? He said, I am your communion. Drink from me.
[4502.15s -> 4511.61s]  All right. Hey, you need to relax. Um, the wall. Yeah, we got to get out of here. We have to leave.
[4511.85s -> 4516.60s]  Jump past these guys. Ready? You're gonna. Oh Jesus. Oh God. We're not going that way.
[4516.60s -> 4530.41s]  Oh, you're not that way. I think I'm with you. No. Yep. We, we wrapped back around. Yeah. Okay.
[4530.41s -> 4537.40s]  We're good. We're good. Who's this guy? You're friendly. Okay. Like seven or eight friendlies
[4537.40s -> 4546.52s]  here. Yeah. It's the whole dungeon is friendly apparently. I feel bad for Ethan. That's, that
[4546.52s -> 4559.96s]  was so funny. All guys just looted up. I know just met six. Hey, why not? Oh, look at all these
[4559.96s -> 4566.62s]  heels. A lot of stuff here. All been looted. We should probably make our way towards the circle
[4566.62s -> 4576.10s]  though. Yeah. Watch out for this. Okay. All right. Watch out for the thing you said to watch out for
[4576.10s -> 4582.10s]  you. Yeah. I jumped it. I fucking, I'm an idiot. So if we find food and we don't know what it is,
[4582.10s -> 4593.88s]  are you guys going to test it to make sure it's not poisonous? I think there'll be people here.
[4595.21s -> 4599.21s]  There's a lot of people. We have like an entire Warcraft raid. I think we're going to be all right.
[4600.98s -> 4607.10s]  We have a whole five man Warcraft dungeon group. People's people coughing in here.
[4609.42s -> 4621.03s]  I can't breathe. That shit's making me choke. How long does it take to die in there? Like one. Oh
[4621.03s -> 4634.65s]  my God. It's chasing me. Okay. This is the way the developers intended the game to be played.
[4636.28s -> 4654.76s]  Actually kind of true. I hear fighting going on. We're good. Kill this archer. I'm starting to
[4654.76s -> 4658.76s]  forget who is friendly. We have to, there's too many people claiming to be friendly that I'm going
[4658.76s -> 4663.70s]  to turn around and kill somebody. If I had a Zwei hander, that's basically what I would do.
[4663.70s -> 4688.78s]  I would just do a big wide swing. Ow. So many fucking spiders. Uh oh. That guy is getting
[4688.78s -> 4699.75s]  chased by four different entities. Okay. We're good. We're good. Oh my God. I almost just hit you
[4699.75s -> 4711.86s]  twice. I don't know how. Thank you. Uh huh. I did something. Yeah. Just like loot up for sure.
[4711.86s -> 4716.02s]  Just pick up everything. Yeah. You guys did as much as you can. Even the boxes are like
[4716.02s -> 4725.32s]  barrels. I said, Hey, can you please do a world record bong hit? Um, no, I'm good. Not right now.
[4725.32s -> 4733.56s]  Actually, uh, talk to you. Take this shrine. We're okay. I'm here reporting. This is a power shrine.
[4733.56s -> 4739.48s]  You'll hit for way more. You did one earlier. Yeah. I mean, I already, I broke the world record
[4739.48s -> 4749.29s]  earlier. I have to do it again. Like shut up. Is it true that you swing faster if you duck in the
[4749.29s -> 4763.26s]  middle of a felling acts? Well, I don't know that speed. Oh, did you get the smash perk?
[4763.26s -> 4769.08s]  You can break walls and stuff. Yeah. Oh, you can break doors. I didn't tell you break a door
[4769.08s -> 4776.28s]  and you can break chests. Yeah. With the felling acts, even chests. Oh, bad guys. Uh, there's a
[4776.28s -> 4783.16s]  party in here, like a different party, like two parties. Actually, I'm shooting at them.
[4783.16s -> 4796.87s]  There's one to our left. Let's go. I think there's an invisible guy at like one 95 rogue. All right.
[4797.75s -> 4800.71s]  They're getting to be too many people around. I don't know who's friendly,
[4800.71s -> 4806.20s]  so just be aware of that. I don't know. You might die from, I might accidentally hit you.
[4806.20s -> 4812.52s]  Oh, is this the guy that has to play among us in every game? That's too hard of a decision.
[4815.74s -> 4821.03s]  Send your minions to fight these guys. Hey, go fight those people.
[4824.57s -> 4834.84s]  Hey, send your minions. I'm playing a necromancer. It's all fun and games until
[4834.84s -> 4838.84s]  there's only one portal for all nine of us. Yeah. When there's one portal left, I'm sorry,
[4838.84s -> 4849.00s]  but I'm just swinging this down there guys. It's right here. The bad guy. That's a bad guy.
[4849.64s -> 4856.66s]  Are you friendly? All right. Well, then it looks like you looks like you and I are going to have a
[4856.66s -> 4876.81s]  one V one of one of my minions. Oh no. Let me do this. Yeah. This guy had gear. Get him,
[4876.81s -> 4883.48s]  get him, kill him. I demand it right here. Right here. Guys, on this body right here.
[4883.56s -> 4902.15s]  Uh, come get this weapon. This guy right here. Oh my fucking God. Get this shit off my character.
[4906.98s -> 4914.50s]  This is my portal. Wait, is yours? Okay. Where's mine? The one there's a guy up there finding one
[4914.50s -> 4921.67s]  for you. Oh, okay. You go up there. I really don't have much shit. So if I die, it's all good.
[4921.67s -> 4925.59s]  You know, you need to make shit. No, you need to make some shit though. Yeah. But I haven't been
[4925.59s -> 4931.13s]  looting anything because there's nine people in our party. Uh, so it's like locusts. Just kill them
[4931.13s -> 4946.07s]  all. There's only red portals up here. It's only red portals. Uh, did they take the, oh no, we can't
[4946.07s -> 4954.66s]  go. No, there's one portal here. I got one here. Oh no, I got one here. Alex, be, be good. Uh,
[4954.66s -> 4961.43s]  I'm being chased by a mimic. I'm just leaving. I have to go in the red. I have to go in the red.
[4961.43s -> 4967.02s]  Oh, you went wait. I'm the last man standing. You have to get up here. Oh, you have to get
[4967.02s -> 4970.46s]  up here. Go on the red, go on the red, go on the red. It's all good. Yeah, but no, but it's,
[4970.46s -> 4974.38s]  you go to the next dungeon. Like you guys going to go to the next one. You're good. It's not,
[4974.38s -> 4981.18s]  you can make it. You might not. I'm one with the darkness. Oh shit. Oh, I'm sorry. You guys
[4981.18s -> 4986.95s]  gotta explain this shit before the critical moment. I thought there'd be more portals, but
[4986.95s -> 4990.79s]  that was unlucky. Well, to be fair on that round, there were like nine people.
[4992.39s -> 5003.35s]  It was kind of an interesting one. Is it time to watch poke clear this whole dungeon? No, I'm just
[5003.35s -> 5009.48s]  going to die. Oh, are you dead too? No, he's in the next dungeon. Oh, he took red and you took
[5009.48s -> 5017.27s]  blue. Yeah. I just left. I thought we were just leaving. Sorry. Poke is going to literally kill
[5017.27s -> 5027.96s]  the boss right now. No, I'm extracting or something. No, no, no. I honestly want to watch. Yeah. Oh,
[5027.96s -> 5043.37s]  I can't see anything guys. Smart. Smart. Somebody said, I swear poking through a blue portal. Yeah,
[5043.37s -> 5052.30s]  I thought you did leave poke. Oh my God. What the fuck is that? Is that a person that just ran
[5052.30s -> 5062.15s]  there? Someone ran there and died. Look at these strats. I took your portal. I did. Oh, I thought
[5062.15s -> 5077.34s]  you were just kind of, you just were gone. Oops. This is big brain. Yeah, it is. What do you have
[5077.34s -> 5085.96s]  for a bow? Let me see. That's pretty good. Oh, you can look at the inventory. Oh yeah. Hit tab. You
[5085.96s -> 5103.75s]  got some, you got some good shit in here poke. Yeah. I want to get out. Oh no. Has a reflective
[5103.75s -> 5113.58s]  shield. It hurts you. Did this standing on the light post is this is, this is working out really
[5113.58s -> 5136.31s]  well. So like, you're going to get out of here. No, it's infinite arrows, but you do have to reload.
[5136.31s -> 5143.58s]  Okay. I think if you play it safe, I think you actually will get out of here. I don't think,
[5143.58s -> 5146.94s]  I don't think anybody else is even in here or did anybody else take it? How can you take, can you
[5146.94s -> 5156.36s]  tell? Someone ran here and just died over there. Oh yeah, they did. So they might've dropped all
[5156.36s -> 5168.41s]  their shit from the last. Okay. You did the movie thing where you only hit the bars, you know,
[5168.41s -> 5171.85s]  like when the villain is shooting like an automatic weapon and the hero's running on
[5171.85s -> 5177.69s]  like a catwalk and every bullet just inexplicably sparks off of the side rail. That's what you just
[5177.69s -> 5187.62s]  did. Like and they're always putting their hands up kind of like that's somehow protecting them
[5187.62s -> 5192.18s]  from the bolts. Yeah. If you cover your face and you don't look at the sparks, you're safer. Yeah.
[5192.18s -> 5199.91s]  And then they're never, they're never firing back. They're always like running. You gotta outrun the
[5199.91s -> 5204.23s]  bullets. Yep. You just, you just run out, run no matter, even the bullets are hitting where you
[5204.23s -> 5220.66s]  are. Some good loot. What do you have? I'm gonna look at your inventory. So purples probably are
[5220.66s -> 5225.22s]  down here like crazy then in here in high roller, I would imagine. I like these pants. I just found
[5225.22s -> 5232.73s]  these frock or just see that. That's real. Plus two physical power plus two healing. Good for a
[5232.73s -> 5252.12s]  cleric. Oh no. What is that? It's a centaur. There are centaurs. Yeah. Good luck with that.
[5252.12s -> 5259.64s]  This is a, this is a boss room. I figured what boss this is. That looks like a boss. Yeah. I,
[5259.64s -> 5265.67s]  I don't know. I think you just get out of here. They try to run there. Open the door.
[5265.67s -> 5290.89s]  Is this the only avenue? Oh, nice. Do the skeletons fight the boss? I don't think so. No,
[5290.89s -> 5307.40s]  something killed the skeletons in there. Maybe they were summons. Hey, this is my buddy, Eric.
[5307.40s -> 5326.17s]  Oh, when you get far enough away, he unsummons the skeletons. He's like a necromancer. I enjoy
[5326.17s -> 5330.25s]  the lore of the necromancer who waits thousands of years for you to come through. But like when
[5330.25s -> 5339.13s]  you leave his section of the park, he, um, he gets sad. His animatronic turns off. Oh,
[5340.25s -> 5354.46s]  he has to go through his like Freddy Fazbear routine. Oh, okay. You can open the door in the
[5354.46s -> 5367.24s]  right. Right. It's like watching a, it's like watching a little movie. I love this. Yeah. Oh
[5367.24s -> 5413.02s]  God folk. They move so fast. You weren't kidding. Good shit in here. No, sorry for holding you guys
[5413.02s -> 5418.22s]  up, man. No, it's no, I like watching this. Yeah. I, I, this is good to see what's going on in here.
[5418.22s -> 5435.45s]  Oh my God. Oh man. Oh, no way. Is this going to work? My friend. Oh, that was a noble sacrifice.
[5435.45s -> 5446.31s]  That was a noble sacrifice. I got out. Nice. Nice. That's huge. Hey, I'll get you one of you guys
[5446.31s -> 5455.08s]  pants. That is really good. I like pants. I got a, I got a lot of blue. I got both of you pants.
[5455.64s -> 5461.14s]  You guys bring your pants at home. I got y'all pants. Yeah. Just leave your pants. Yeah. Already
[5461.14s -> 5468.76s]  done. I got a few. Can't believe I got out. High roller red place is really hard. No. Yeah. That's
[5468.76s -> 5473.53s]  awesome. You can, you got like a purple too. Yeah. You got the, you didn't get the best experience
[5473.53s -> 5479.62s]  though for high roller. You had to fight like 10 Ethan's 10 Ethan encounters. Let's call them
[5479.62s -> 5487.22s]  Ethan though. Yeah. An Ethan encounter did show up a few times here. Guys, no more Ethan's. Okay.
[5487.22s -> 5496.79s]  Yeah. When you show up, you show up with blood lust. Yeah. Fight us. No more Ethan's. Oh man.
[5496.79s -> 5501.03s]  All right. Let's go. Like if you're going to snipe, like try to scare us and make it like funny, like
[5501.99s -> 5507.22s]  try to kill us. Actually, Ethan was really funny because you thought Ethan was going to like scream
[5507.22s -> 5513.22s]  a bunch of bad words. So that was actually my moment. That was a pretty great moment. That was
[5513.22s -> 5521.54s]  a great moment. Okay. I assume we're not recueing for that because I am broke. Yeah. We'll go normal.
[5521.54s -> 5530.57s]  Yeah. We'll do a normal one. Uh, I'll bring you a gray felling X just for now. Okay. I'll take it.
[5530.57s -> 5536.71s]  It's so funny just how much that wiped out my bank account though. It's like, it was almost two rows,
[5536.71s -> 5545.26s]  like two, almost a whole, like a whole row. We'll get stuff down. I'm ready. All right. I just want
[5545.26s -> 5554.04s]  to make sure I don't, I just want to bring, you know, I don't want to bring anything good. All
[5554.04s -> 5559.00s]  right. I'm happy with this. I'm happy with that. I got my long sword. Shit looks pretty good. All
[5559.00s -> 5590.02s]  right. I'm good to go. Everybody ready? Yep. Should be good. Go. Oh shit. I forgot I was wearing this.
[5590.66s -> 5600.79s]  What do you have? I got nothing, dude. Oh shit. What do you mean? What do you have? That was,
[5601.72s -> 5609.40s]  you took me into the high roller in my fifth game. I lost it all. Hey, but now you have experience
[5609.40s -> 5617.11s]  there. We did a, we did a $100 max bat single spin. Yeah. And then accidentally ran into like
[5617.11s -> 5623.75s]  eight other people in the same slot. Yeah. There were like 10 people at the same slot machine,
[5623.75s -> 5642.42s]  all like reaching for the max bet. Ooh, trying to get a grasp of like armor ratings. Oh, I was
[5642.42s -> 5656.55s]  muted. Talking to myself. Sorry about that. Okay. I'm ready. Fuck. Wait. Unarmed the builds. Here,
[5656.55s -> 5662.18s]  someone take this pants. Shit. I didn't bring any torches. I'm an idiot. I got one. I got an extra
[5662.18s -> 5672.26s]  torch here. Oh, awesome. Uh, I'll take these pants. Why not? And I'll take that torch. All right.
[5672.26s -> 5688.06s]  Nice. Collect. All right. You can stand here in the middle and cleave them all. Wait, who or
[5688.70s -> 5699.26s]  anything? You gave me a felling axe. He can cleave. Maybe I can't. I don't know if you can. I can't
[5699.26s -> 5715.16s]  on my third swing. All right. Okay. There's been such a massive debate on this. How do you open a,
[5715.16s -> 5722.10s]  how do you do the lockpicking? It seems impossible. How would you, how do you do it? This one's not,
[5722.10s -> 5727.14s]  but it usually is. You press space when it hits it. It's okay. I thought it was like, like it's space.
[5727.14s -> 5739.11s]  Yeah, it's space. Is there a lockpicking minigame? Yeah. And does it have to be in the yellow or the
[5739.11s -> 5747.16s]  red? Yellow. I don't know what the red does. I'll be honest. Yeah. It says space on the screen. Yeah,
[5747.16s -> 5754.81s]  but it's on the, that shit's on the screen for like a 10th of a second. Is smashing the chest
[5754.81s -> 5761.75s]  better than picking them? Do you like lose any loot? Uh, no, it's better to kill. I think someone's
[5761.75s -> 5771.00s]  here. Oh, people here. Are you friendly? I thought we were. Oh, bad guys. I think he's scary. Okay.
[5771.00s -> 5778.54s]  Do we want to get out of this hallway? Is it a mage? It was a skeleton. Oh,
[5782.28s -> 5807.61s]  you'll see what I mean. Go look at them. Let's see. Okay. Nobody here. Something. You're right.
[5807.61s -> 5811.45s]  Nobody's here. Somebody here. Oh, people come through the door right now. Spider.
[5812.33s -> 5823.46s]  Oh, no. Yep. I'm watching her. Six. Oh, they're doing the same thing. Be careful. They're shooting
[5823.46s -> 5831.86s]  through the hole too. I hit him. I killed him. I killed him. What? Holy shit. Did you really?
[5832.34s -> 5839.91s]  Yeah. Who's this guy? I killed that guy. I killed that guy. Oh, there's another guy. What the fuck
[5839.91s -> 5845.75s]  is this? It's a rogue. Yes. One more guy. One more guy in here. He's low. He's low. He's low. He's low.
[5845.75s -> 5852.74s]  He ran to the right. Get it. Go get him. I don't know. Down. Maybe he closes his door. I'm pretty
[5852.74s -> 5864.30s]  sure we should loot. Hey, go loot. Go loot. So rogues can just be invisible. Yeah. It's like a
[5864.30s -> 5875.00s]  cool down. It's like for like 30 seconds. Yeah. You can't do it for that long. Okay. I didn't kill
[5875.00s -> 5881.08s]  the cleric. He got away. Dude, that skeleton skin is seriously complete. It's so that's OP.
[5881.08s -> 5896.06s]  You I just think that you're an enemy in the game. Yeah. That's crazy. Okay. Okay. Let's keep running.
[5896.06s -> 5904.84s]  Are we good? Yeah. If you got some potions. Good potions. Gloves right here. I just have a potion
[5904.84s -> 5915.78s]  of protection. That's it. Here. Take these two and use them. We use one at least. I also picked
[5915.78s -> 5923.50s]  up a campfire off one of them. I wonder where they are. I have no idea. You guys see anybody?
[5923.58s -> 5928.31s]  No. Yeah. That that person got away and it's really interesting that they did because if we
[5928.31s -> 5935.21s]  ever if we ever saw them that would be bad for them. It would be awful for them. Let's just keep
[5935.21s -> 5954.33s]  going then. Top it up. Must have been the wind. Just remember we'll let you live today. I put a
[5954.33s -> 5966.66s]  trap. We're just like waiting for the comedy moment to happen right now. You're just sitting there.
[5966.66s -> 5988.25s]  Just ready. He doesn't even have the voice on. He just like okay whatever. All I'm saying if
[5988.33s -> 5994.84s]  he gets in a portal at the end I'm gonna be pissed. He's gonna take our portal. That's what I mean.
[5998.15s -> 6003.51s]  We gotta get out this way. Where the hell are you guys going? I've been back and forth across
[6003.51s -> 6007.69s]  this guy's hallway. There's guys up there. I think we were just waiting to see what this guy was
[6007.69s -> 6016.47s]  gonna do. What are you doing over there? You're not gonna kill me. What are you doing? Oh you
[6016.47s -> 6037.98s]  killed me. That hurt a lot. I'm dead. I just killed you. Oh I'm dead but I got three hits on
[6037.98s -> 6047.59s]  him. Uh oh. Wait the friend. Where's the friend? The cleric friend. Where's the cleric friend?
[6047.59s -> 6067.38s]  Where's the cleric friend? I didn't know that does that. What was that? Oh Jerm I'm so sorry
[6067.38s -> 6073.06s]  you walked into my bullet. That was so. No dude don't worry about it. I'm an idiot. I got hit.
[6073.94s -> 6080.76s]  No it was me. Damn it. As long as it was funny. And hey why don't we spectate our um cleric friend?
[6080.76s -> 6098.39s]  Well. This is them right here right? Why indeed. Where are they? Sorry. No dude this game is
[6098.39s -> 6104.28s]  fucking a mess. Yeah it's all good. I was gonna die anyways. I was gonna take one more hit and
[6104.28s -> 6108.92s]  I was gonna die anyways. I'm just glad you killed him before I killed him. I love how you went to
[6108.92s -> 6116.70s]  punch him in the face though. That was funny. Your last dying wish was to just punch in the face.
[6116.94s -> 6122.06s]  That cleric we saved should have helped us. I don't know where they went. He just maybe he
[6122.06s -> 6127.27s]  took an opportunity. He's probably not even. That's narrative set up and payoff. That person's
[6127.27s -> 6130.55s]  probably not even on voice chat like you said and they just probably like oh my god three people.
[6130.55s -> 6135.26s]  They're letting me live. And then just kind of went on with their day. You save a guy in act one
[6135.26s -> 6145.59s]  he doesn't show up for act three. What do you mean saved him? I mean I don't know. Well we killed.
[6145.59s -> 6150.31s]  Okay is it technically did we technically save him or do we yeah that's that's a weird way to say
[6150.31s -> 6157.10s]  that but if we didn't we killed we killed him we killed him from ourselves yes we spared him that's
[6157.10s -> 6167.00s]  better yeah we killed his two friends and spared him i see all right oh my rogue now poke is going
[6167.00s -> 6174.39s]  poke is going uh oh oh and you got one of those be a skeleton skin yeah you go to shop top right
[6174.39s -> 6187.16s]  and you collect points every time you extract very cool very cool so you're gonna be scary
[6187.16s -> 6192.12s]  you're gonna scare the okay good i like that you're gonna scare people yeah all right i'm
[6192.12s -> 6198.54s]  bringing uh i'm gonna bring this blue halberd and let's go i have a sweet hander anyone want one
[6198.54s -> 6201.98s]  actually i i will take that i'll take this render i'll bring two of them then i have two of them is
[6201.98s -> 6211.61s]  the birdish good uh is yours white yeah it's just white i'll bring you i'll bring you weapon
[6220.15s -> 6237.35s]  okay rogue i like your name thank you okay you said you said you are you are bringing a weapon
[6237.35s -> 6243.30s]  yeah i'm bringing you guys two sweet handers i don't like them though they're not that good
[6243.30s -> 6248.65s]  they're kind of annoying to use because you can only use them you can't use them in a hallway
[6248.65s -> 6253.45s]  yeah you have to use like the right click which is okay but um i don't think the upswing like
[6253.45s -> 6261.72s]  hits anything vital like the head yeah it's not worth it what's your favorite what's your favorite
[6261.72s -> 6270.58s]  class what's like you think is the best one um i really like i like playing rogue i think they're
[6270.58s -> 6275.93s]  fun to fuck around with i would have guessed that from the jumping onto the chalice strat you can do
[6275.93s -> 6280.57s]  fun stuff was as rogue you can get like a thing where you fast right yeah you're fast and you
[6280.57s -> 6286.01s]  could stealth and move like 10 seconds uh 10 steps in stealth then you could like outplay them
[6286.01s -> 6296.06s]  trick them you know yeah it's this game's fun i like it a lot i'm ready all right let's go for it
[6296.06s -> 6301.69s]  i love this game it's a really good game yeah it makes a strong first impression i'm just looking
[6301.69s -> 6308.25s]  forward to more just like pve stuff more like maps i think it it has a lot of potential for sure
[6308.25s -> 6317.18s]  just hope that they get it at the right get it the right way how would elmo play this game
[6317.18s -> 6323.14s]  elmo's not old enough to play this like what what a what a dumb question are you trying to
[6323.14s -> 6332.44s]  get a voice yeah is it elmo like 50 yeah almost like in his like mid 40s wait that's right no
[6332.44s -> 6347.16s]  isn't elmo like four how old is elmo he's three yeah no he elmo is supposed to be three years old
[6347.16s -> 6355.03s]  oh yeah just oh nice nice nice yeah you take the blue i'll take the green oh this is an annoying
[6355.03s -> 6368.95s]  room nice i'm really strong okay we have to take turns not killing you yeah i i don't i'm
[6369.19s -> 6377.74s]  i don't want to swing because i'm gonna kill somebody nice oh what do you have let me i can't
[6377.74s -> 6382.54s]  expect you but you probably have some cool shit on this character oh yeah i'm really really really
[6382.54s -> 6390.63s]  yeah real strong what the you just went like a golf club who i was trying to figure out what the
[6390.63s -> 6404.95s]  hell it was hitting a wizard sword oh great two archers yeah now let's go yeah i don't like that
[6404.95s -> 6420.58s]  route that route stinks you could break the door yeah but the fucking weapon it just try it again
[6420.58s -> 6427.69s]  no get you got to get it i have to do it from this angle i thought you were going to get me
[6427.69s -> 6438.86s]  with the backstroke for a second there oh lockpick yeah so how do you is do you have any lockpicks on
[6438.86s -> 6448.90s]  you no do you do you have the perk to do i have it you got it oh my god uh yeah battle axe oh yeah
[6450.71s -> 6463.50s]  kind of kind of junk that barefoot sound yeah the penguin slap you just scared the shit out of me
[6463.50s -> 6469.06s]  by the way i saw a person walk up in my peripheral and i freaked out trying to dodge all the spike
[6469.06s -> 6476.55s]  traps there's a double axe in here is that good for barbarian probably right it's just a gray
[6476.55s -> 6484.47s]  yeah it's how to get take this uh this battle axe in here 50 damage you probably would like it maybe
[6484.47s -> 6494.10s]  more than that if you if you don't like this way under i like the range of the this sword
[6495.37s -> 6501.91s]  yeah it's just i can't figure out why the upswing is like hitting something it's weird it doesn't
[6501.91s -> 6509.18s]  have a weird swing all right we're gonna make our way out of here you know this spot right here
[6509.18s -> 6525.64s]  oh secret this takes you all the way across okay that's that's good to know i think i've done this
[6525.64s -> 6540.60s]  accident like once or twice but it's good to know that it's here this game is kind of like
[6540.60s -> 6545.46s]  minecraft with guns i mean i that's that's what i said earlier but people are like you're a
[6545.46s -> 6549.62s]  fucking idiot and stuff and i don't know it's like i feel pretty validated somebody else said that
[6549.62s -> 6562.09s]  it's like annoying when people say i'm stupid about it i feel you yeah more terraria but
[6562.09s -> 6573.82s]  whatever this leads to the same place i'd give it like a eight out of ten well it's not even out
[6573.82s -> 6584.81s]  yet so you can't you can't give it a rating i mean that was a thought you were making an ig in joke
[6584.81s -> 6589.69s]  oh is that is that what that actually is originally from wasn't wasn't ig in the skyrim with guns

[7102.73s -> 7110.25s]  yeah stir uh i don't know if i don't know if that's gonna uh stir is hey he enjoyed his time in the
[7110.25s -> 7114.97s]  game he enjoyed his time in the case this game i didn't say that i said he enjoyed his time in
[7114.97s -> 7127.02s]  the game he had a lot of fun in he hates it i don't think stir hates the game he had his he had fun
[7127.02s -> 7138.09s]  in the game when we played it two days ago i'll try to convince them yeah maybe you can all right
[7138.09s -> 7144.50s]  sorry i'm just buying potions this is a lot to take in you're doing great you're owning
[7144.50s -> 7151.22s]  now honest to god you're doing fantastically literally installing the game my secret is letting
[7151.22s -> 7159.78s]  you go through the door first he said on his stream that he hates it okay well i didn't say
[7159.78s -> 7175.88s]  that so he leaked it himself we are ready to go i think those stir hatings the game like this
[7175.88s -> 7184.52s]  is actually directly proportional to how much he actually enjoys it um i think he he liked it but
[7184.52s -> 7193.00s]  he didn't really love it but that means he loves it possibly although me him and i had a huge
[7193.00s -> 7198.22s]  vampire survivor's argument so i don't know i tried to convince him for like an hour straight
[7198.22s -> 7206.54s]  on stream one time and it just didn't work why isn't like that game too no he could probably tell
[7206.54s -> 7215.67s]  you every reason why he's he's very opinionated he's very opinionated aren't we all yeah we are
[7215.67s -> 7228.31s]  that's all right oh shit i don't know what's what who i don't know who's doing that but that's cool
[7229.19s -> 7234.02s]  what there's a chest in there oh there's a there's a secret
[7238.63s -> 7245.02s]  there was a trinket oh okay yeah that's like a boss peace if you if you're under him he can't
[7245.02s -> 7255.78s]  hit you wow this is actually working holy shit that thing is usually a horrendous thing to deal
[7255.78s -> 7269.00s]  with oh horseman's axe okay do you want to try a one-hander me yeah uh i don't know i like the
[7269.00s -> 7273.96s]  range of this but i can i can just hear it out take a look it's not a bad one too
[7273.96s -> 7282.89s]  trader can barbarians put on a shield or no no one hitter probably pretty bad then
[7282.89s -> 7298.46s]  just yeah this is okay watch out oh my goodness the bonk weapon it's good for the hallways and
[7298.46s -> 7304.15s]  the doors that was so like masterfully done poke oh thank you there's like you still use all the
[7304.15s -> 7311.42s]  purple all the dodging all the strafing i would have died in this room these mobs drop like
[7311.42s -> 7324.22s]  amulets and stuff they're really good oh bunny hopping is actually in the game okay you should
[7324.22s -> 7336.14s]  do a weld uh i don't want to do weld right now rain behind you alex yeah i just can't you are
[7336.14s -> 7354.42s]  opening this chest you can finish it thank you so much cleric um helmet plus one will yeah i want
[7354.42s -> 7359.30s]  to try a different class soon but going back to level one i'm almost level five it's easy to level
[7359.30s -> 7364.02s]  yeah it's it's the leveling is i know it's like oh shit like level five level 10 level 20 the
[7364.02s -> 7367.54s]  difference is almost nothing it's just being able to pick another perk it's it's really everybody's
[7367.54s -> 7389.27s]  literally just at zero it's all gear yeah oh people here oh never mind oh i think there is
[7389.27s -> 7400.23s]  a person at 150 back by me see there is skeleton peeping in the door i just i swung and i know
[7400.23s -> 7408.34s]  that's what that wasn't me oh oh god run this way people cross i think there might be somebody back
[7408.34s -> 7413.96s]  here oh my god i can't get through the door yep this wizard shooting shit at us from across the
[7413.96s -> 7423.90s]  way okay do you see the room at like 150 i saw like a head through there a minute ago would you
[7423.90s -> 7435.26s]  smoke usually open would you smoke a blunt with poke yeah what do we have it's almost here i'll
[7435.26s -> 7453.00s]  get on stuffing in oh that was oh find us behind us killed good good good good i'm just like my
[7453.00s -> 7459.22s]  whole goal is to try to avoid hitting the both of you that one hander just saved my life so uh
[7459.22s -> 7464.17s]  thanks for dropping that they were all up in my face there's some other shit on here i don't want
[7464.17s -> 7472.54s]  to take it all use your right click yeah but even it's like uh uh yeah but still i feel like
[7472.54s -> 7476.89s]  okay when i do the wind up does that hit don't blame me i don't know what the fuck you could
[7476.89s -> 7482.81s]  have done honestly if i if i participated in that fight we would have lost yeah everyone
[7485.85s -> 7491.16s]  here i'll use the campfire for you oh okay yeah that'd be good wait do you have a surgical kit
[7491.16s -> 7495.48s]  i got i got heels too if you want them i have a campfire kit extra i got three potions on the
[7495.48s -> 7503.06s]  ground right here for you right here by me just just chug them well don't chug them but after
[7503.06s -> 7509.42s]  each other do you have to wait some guys some loot for money like before you drink another
[7509.42s -> 7516.46s]  potion do you have to wait till the bar stops flashing yes oh yeah there's uh some more
[7516.46s -> 7536.74s]  trinkets on here so i've seen a golden chest before but i couldn't open it is there have you
[7536.74s -> 7552.36s]  ever opened a golden chest book yeah it's nothing crazy oh oh those guys back there yeah i think
[7552.36s -> 7559.91s]  that's probably who i saw they were in this room we just went through and then they ran that way
[7559.91s -> 7567.06s]  and then got killed oh you jumped down all right we uh oh watch out a lot of shit i don't think you
[7567.06s -> 7580.81s]  did never mind never mind oh we got the whole room coming oh yeah i see across across person
[7580.81s -> 7593.66s]  is concerning me mage we should just leave this yeah it's this it's never it's always bad yeah
[7594.58s -> 7600.87s]  is there is there a tier of item rarity over purple oh legendary so that and that's in the
[7600.87s -> 7605.99s]  play test right now is that orange yeah oh man i don't even know how you'd find one of those
[7605.99s -> 7614.98s]  i bet someone would give you one right now you have but to ask i definitely don't want that
[7614.98s -> 7621.46s]  yeah i feel you ruins the magic honestly if somebody came into a lobby and just dropped
[7621.46s -> 7629.11s]  like a legendary on the ground i just wouldn't even pick it up i'd throw it away so i'll take
[7629.11s -> 7665.29s]  it and hide it oh that was a lot of money on this one don't shoot me god damn it circles coming in
[7667.34s -> 7677.21s]  this thing is hard to use i forgot so how often does the circle close uh often is there like a
[7677.21s -> 7680.97s]  timer before it moves or it just randomly starts all people here in the middle it's probably every
[7680.97s -> 7691.43s]  couple minutes are we two or three minutes are we fighting somebody dead here i think they're
[7691.43s -> 7699.85s]  they're in trouble i think there's no one died here on the left just one looks like maybe two
[7699.85s -> 7719.67s]  a lot of enemies behind them though i killed them got one and there's a zombie's with me
[7720.47s -> 7725.43s]  i'm just i was trying to get rid of the zombie there's too much gas on there
[7732.30s -> 7740.86s]  unfortunately the guy died in an awkward spot for loot oh my god oh i know he did
[7741.50s -> 7755.43s]  okay okay uh-oh more people no just i think i'm i went to go loot this guy and i separated myself
[7755.43s -> 7761.59s]  from you guys oh are you down in that hallway still yeah yeah yeah come to me here to your left

[8670.90s -> 8677.22s]  you put an arrow in the back of my head and just take all of my things because i've lost my team
[8677.22s -> 8682.42s]  and i don't know and i think we're going to requeue so i'm going to turn around and i please uh
[8682.42s -> 8687.70s]  gentleman if you could uh put the arrow directly into the back of my skull and please take all of
[8687.70s -> 8692.10s]  my things and use them because they're probably worth a little bit maybe they could get you a few
[8692.10s -> 8698.66s]  coins if you could just and all i i have a few last words i'd like to say just give me one
[8698.74s -> 8713.34s]  you see through your eyes that's not me i was i was muting the discord so i didn't

[8797.42s -> 8805.08s]  to give it to you i also have a blue halberd this thing is disgusting plus two to all attributes
[8805.08s -> 8812.25s]  plus two to agility this thing is disgusting go away all right uh i'll see if i can trade

[8816.49s -> 8823.83s]  you to know how cool it was um i apologize i do have a purple swayander how are you with those
[8823.83s -> 8828.55s]  i've never used one before it's fun it's i think it could be kind of fun would you like to try a
[8828.55s -> 8837.85s]  purple swayander uh if you trust me with it i don't want to i want to mess up it's all right
[8837.93s -> 8844.95s]  sure yeah i don't matter beta ends in three days i'm gonna i'm gonna go in with nothing
[8844.95s -> 8853.45s]  in that case i'm thinking about saving that all right i'm sorry jerk no i get it you don't trust
[8853.45s -> 8860.66s]  your yet you know i need to get your out there yeah wait jerk has to prove to me sure is is good
[8860.66s -> 8872.52s]  should i say jerk all right let me get it sure jerk jerk jerk jerk apologize to jerk right now
[8872.52s -> 8880.10s]  i i'm sorry i didn't mean that all right so um talks what was you said yeah trying learning
[8880.10s -> 8887.38s]  about spell memory yes it if you have it's a it's amount of spells you can attune and
[8887.94s -> 8891.59s]  you can only do a certain amount before you're kind of like over encumbered or something right
[8891.59s -> 8896.15s]  is that how it works jerk if you could please you have any idea think of it it's like the number of
[8896.15s -> 8909.02s]  words you can know yeah i think that that makes sense do you have any favorite words uh yeah what's
[8909.02s -> 8917.37s]  your favorite word jerf um well i it's kind of like a joke what do you call a piece of dried
[8917.37s -> 8932.01s]  jerf jerfy jerf jerfy yeah yeah like like beef jerky yeah yeah jerfy pretty cool beef jerfy my
[8932.01s -> 8941.69s]  favorite word is mayonnaise that's an interesting one why why because it's kind of it's a lot of
[8941.69s -> 8949.93s]  syllables and it's i like it a lot yeah because it's either it's mayonnaise it'd be like four or
[8949.93s -> 8954.17s]  mayonnaise weird how it can be multiple syllables depending on how you say it very interesting
[8954.17s -> 8965.34s]  word like you could say jerk like jerk or like sure to try to drag it out yeah you can drag it
[8965.34s -> 8970.14s]  out this turned into a thing but i was just trying to ask uh which spells do you think i should
[8970.14s -> 8976.06s]  equip definitely the heel like you know there there is a a heel that only heals you it's not
[8976.06s -> 8981.53s]  a group hill well there's one that heals a target unless there's no target and then it heals you
[8981.53s -> 8987.61s]  okay yeah so that that's the one yeah yeah i got that one i got uh protection shield yep that's a
[8987.61s -> 8993.19s]  good one like the little bubble it's like it's like power shield i've got increased damage by 10
[8993.19s -> 9000.57s]  hell yeah oh and hell yeah and any other special requests i think that sounds pretty good to me
[9000.57s -> 9009.03s]  i think there's is there one that does uh holy damage uh there is a i'm trying to see if my
[9009.03s -> 9019.74s]  glasses it's just holy damage on that italics there's a there's holy light yeah 30 hp heal or
[9019.74s -> 9032.63s]  100 undead damage be liberal with the spells okay you guys ready let's go for it let's do it
[9032.63s -> 9046.30s]  surf it up your idea what your perks are there's a smell emanating from over your direction oh yeah
[9046.30s -> 9051.82s]  it's the jerky in my my back pocket that's what that is i was gonna say i didn't want to but it
[9051.82s -> 9060.82s]  sounded rude to bring it up but it's helpful in case we come across hounds like this one auto
[9060.82s -> 9069.26s]  right here all right let's hope we're in the same game this time and not across the whole
[9069.26s -> 9076.25s]  world from each other that's weird you said brother we're just simply too powerful when united
[9076.25s -> 9088.25s]  they split us up at the start somebody said jerf you look constipated uh how you doing down there
[9088.25s -> 9097.40s]  we are we are split up again what the f**k damn something's wrong what's all right we need to
[9097.40s -> 9102.01s]  breathe all right just i'm just gonna i'm just gonna just yell at people and then have them kill
[9103.06s -> 9110.49s]  did i bring anything expensive kind of oh well yeah hope you didn't bring that axe free gear
[9111.29s -> 9122.41s]  free gear on i have free a free uh this free gear on me they're gonna get that ass i mean axe
[9122.41s -> 9129.62s]  they're gonna get this axe i didn't bring the axe thing thankfully free stuff on me i'm just a free
[9129.62s -> 9132.90s]  i'm a free kill i actually am that i know you might think that i'm saying that i have a group
[9132.90s -> 9137.46s]  of two other people but we can't get in the same game together for some reason so free gear on me
[9137.46s -> 9148.60s]  i'm dying by enemies free gear over here free gear right here you just killed two innocents
[9148.60s -> 9158.97s]  they were so so young just kidding the rangers okay i'm dead that was fast well i just i just
[9158.97s -> 9164.81s]  died and i figured we'd just reload i think that's a great idea but i'm gonna cast a practice spell
[9164.81s -> 9173.05s]  first where are you i wonder why this is weird why is this happening yeah i don't know maybe if we
[9173.05s -> 9186.25s]  just all exit kind of reload let's remake the party yeah yeah you got it oh oh heck oh no wait
[9186.25s -> 9198.41s]  i think i heard you die there was a spike sound yeah that that'd be me oh no jurf is dead good one
[9198.41s -> 9212.78s]  jurf classic classic jurf classic jurf peripheral vision with this helmet all right so yeah actually
[9212.78s -> 9217.42s]  take this opportunity to practice because i can't i can't cast a spell how do you cast a spell
[9217.42s -> 9223.59s]  right let's uh you hold right click i think right and that charges it and you cannot move when you
[9223.59s -> 9233.56s]  cast it that's correct you healed the zombie oh no is it not a zombie is not undead well that's a
[9233.56s -> 9241.19s]  mummy well that's a that's a mummy are mummies not undead i believe um isn't that by definition
[9241.19s -> 9253.16s]  i think that's correct yeah they should be dead classic classic ripple apparently i'm fine this
[9253.16s -> 9260.63s]  is literally bugleberry yeah it kind of is this is the haircut heels do not damage enemies
[9260.63s -> 9267.67s]  apparently so i was completely wrong when i said that to you but it that was the mimic that killed
[9267.67s -> 9275.53s]  me i was running from that thing when i ran to the spike oh yeah there's a spike down there watch
[9279.22s -> 9290.12s]  it found you oh that's the one oh there it is all right so what that's the one that one
[9290.60s -> 9305.22s]  undead that one hurts undead yes okay you gotta whisper too there's a big aoe around you i think
[9305.22s -> 9312.63s]  make sure you loot it oh it's not dead i think it is the stick the best thing you got
[9314.82s -> 9325.99s]  he's not dead jerma can you please get this haircut maybe that would be kind of funny
[9330.95s -> 9338.92s]  this haircut is seriously just okay so casting can you can anybody pull this haircut off i feel
[9338.92s -> 9349.10s]  like it's really hard to but anyways he's casting it go ahead holy purification there you go good
[9349.10s -> 9354.14s]  job i figured it out okay and it's like the zone's coming does a ton of damage by the way it hurts
[9354.14s -> 9362.49s]  a lot oh no that move is incredible zone if you if you um if you run around and grab like two or
[9362.49s -> 9366.49s]  three people and they're chasing you you can almost kill everything and just one huge aoe like that
[9366.49s -> 9375.26s]  it hurts a lot it's like 70 plus damage i think watch out the bugs are eating you my god dude
[9375.82s -> 9383.50s]  so bad what was that it was awful you didn't even like attack so bad oh make a lot
[9385.26s -> 9395.43s]  you were so bad all right let's let's exit game and try this again yeah nice playing with you guys
[9395.43s -> 9399.27s]  it's really fun to play with the jerk um yeah but we're like hopping around cycling people in so
[9399.27s -> 9405.35s]  like yeah see you later it was fun okay yeah maybe next time yeah good just good games all around
[9405.99s -> 9412.92s]  all right let's leave this party let's try this again should we just exit the game or should we
[9413.56s -> 9417.96s]  leave i wonder if we should just all restart i'm just gonna do that i just restarted yeah
[9417.96s -> 9432.09s]  yeah yeah yep yep that's smart start reset and it again uh this is the first time i've
[9432.09s -> 9439.37s]  ever experienced this bug this is weird let's try it again uh what'd you recommend for um
[9440.50s -> 9450.84s]  for a weapon felling axe if you can get one everybody loves felling axes what do you think
[9450.84s -> 9459.64s]  they call him that um probably the guy that invented it like tripped over it oh he wouldn't
[9459.64s -> 9470.22s]  they call trip axes then but it ain't that he fell all right invites going up i get it what's
[9470.22s -> 9482.25s]  your name ripple ripples it's ripple oh i what i say ripples okay all right can this let's come
[9482.25s -> 9489.59s]  on this needs to work i'm okay i'm not bringing any items because if this doesn't work again then
[9489.59s -> 9495.93s]  what the heck that's why i was gonna say i'm glad that this has just been not super try hard
[9495.93s -> 9502.74s]  because i don't have anything to lose anyway yeah either way the spell that i used is it has the
[9502.74s -> 9510.15s]  same description as my the perk that did kill the mummy maybe it is i don't know i haven't played
[9510.15s -> 9517.75s]  any clerk i'm gonna like switch it and then like switch it again okay we're on we're in a team
[9517.75s -> 9524.06s]  and i just did it all right let's do it ready up because one of them says holy purification
[9524.14s -> 9531.32s]  the aoe does undead monster damage and then holy light does just undead target damage
[9531.32s -> 9554.23s]  they just have more than 100 hp okay oh i'm sorry all right it's all right we're good don't
[9554.23s -> 9568.22s]  jerk don't worry about it okay okay i see our names down there yeah hey ripple goodbye jeff

[9616.81s -> 9630.76s]  axe okay okay you said be liberal with the spells but what's the what's the baseline
[9631.48s -> 9642.54s]  i'm sorry there's a more than more than like two two bad guys maybe use a spell yeah on individual
[9642.54s -> 9647.72s]  just single enemies not really but if we have like more than one or two then yeah like should i
[9647.72s -> 9653.18s]  already be healing you i just took a potion so i'm okay but eventually yes i've just my brain just

[9806.73s -> 9818.70s]  yeah they did swing once with a stick yeah that was aggression yeah that's provocation i thought
[9818.70s -> 9824.98s]  i was casting protection on you uh that was a self-cast you can also very protected you can
[9824.98s -> 9831.10s]  give it to enemies too by the way like you can heal enemies oh good so if you cast a healing spell
[9831.10s -> 9838.09s]  and you do it to another player they will get healed there's some comedy there oh yeah that's
[9838.09s -> 9848.10s]  funny i did also like the part where he said it's jurfing time yeah that's your i'm about to jurf

[10991.43s -> 11002.07s]  jeref what's your favorite item what do you like to use um stick big old jerv stick
[11002.71s -> 11015.91s]  the old jerv quarterstaff stick a big old jerv stick uh what do you what do you call uh
[11017.40s -> 11026.06s]  uh well have you had an impossible burger yet no let's try it's impossible it's just you should
[11026.06s -> 11031.69s]  give it a try i feel like it'd be interesting you think jerv specifically would enjoy an
[11031.69s -> 11036.89s]  impossible burger actually jerv would probably take a bite of the impossible burger and then
[11036.89s -> 11044.22s]  kill me with his axe because i suggested it in the first place so it's not good i mean i'm
[11044.22s -> 11051.75s]  getting mixed signals here okay that's like a jerv bites this his eyes turn red he grabs the axe
[11051.75s -> 11058.79s]  and he just kills me jerv they're pretty good though you probably like it am i killing you or
[11058.79s -> 11065.90s]  am i liking it it depends on um i don't know it depends on how you how you are i'm bringing this
[11065.90s -> 11072.22s]  oh i am i don't know like i don't know what what jerv's preferences are in regards to food
[11072.22s -> 11080.54s]  i feel like there's a pretty large middle ground between killing you and liking it
[11080.54s -> 11095.64s]  it might be okay all right we good yeah um yeah i'm gonna go jerv jerv jerv jerv jerv jerv jerv
[11095.64s -> 11113.26s]  jerv jerv hi everybody that's the last thing some of them will hear the last thing i might hear

[11207.51s -> 11215.51s]  tell him to stop moving yeah i think jerv's little soul and put in a little little sacrifice spot
[11215.51s -> 11226.49s]  we're gonna try um jerv i i mean um um whatever your name is just pick it up excuse me i don't
[11226.49s -> 11231.69s]  i'm just starting to saying jerv it's like in my it's like earwormed into my answer to jerv all
[11231.69s -> 11239.16s]  right i got jerv soul we can bring jerv back yes okay i don't have a resurrection spell no it's
[11239.16s -> 11245.14s]  okay we just find a shrine okay there's one more body was there anyone else then really i mean

[11273.22s -> 11277.78s]  soul back at home it's in my other pair of pants can you imagine taking a soul out of somebody's
[11277.78s -> 11284.49s]  body and like just putting it in their pocket and leaving that seems okay how do we um we should
[11284.49s -> 11291.98s]  probably just hang out over here this one archer it's two now just be careful stay behind me get
[11291.98s -> 11297.26s]  this uh bait this over here you've been blessed that's very helpful how did that even hit me i
[11297.26s -> 11301.58s]  will never know i think you put down your shield the second he attacked is that what happened
[11304.26s -> 11307.22s]  i didn't want to say anything but i did anyway i'm sorry do you want me to heal you or do you have
[11307.22s -> 11317.50s]  potions uh i i would love a heal okay thank you all right this guy's gonna be annoying
[11317.50s -> 11326.20s]  and you oh you can cancel watch out yeah make sure you stay right behind me because these things
[11326.20s -> 11341.26s]  hurt a lot they're very annoying to kill oh i think it's good okay height is a good strategy
[11341.26s -> 11349.66s]  it is actually was it better than what i was that scary sound you guys hear that
[11351.40s -> 11360.30s]  somebody's coming in here right now no that's you opening that it's okay we're good now we
[11360.30s -> 11371.00s]  need to find a shrine nothing here all right there's gonna be a lot of people in this area
[11371.00s -> 11377.56s]  so just be careful should i focus on support or offense if we run into other people if we run into
[11377.56s -> 11381.77s]  one or two people focus on healing me because that's what they're going to be doing if it's
[11381.77s -> 11415.18s]  the similar setup uh take that say a prayer for jerk okay um oh thanks yep crouch through this

[12582.01s -> 12585.70s]  heel myself feel this is this is working out pretty well all right we should

[12632.72s -> 12644.80s]  a lot of things I have the least amount of both so just don't get killed there's

[12699.60s -> 12703.04s]  killed you it's Alex I don't know if I did or not but it may have been me wait
[12703.04s -> 12709.76s]  did because I was blocking the daggers I think they might have poked around the
[12709.76s -> 12715.20s]  daggers I don't know I I had like a few greens I did it's check the kill feed it
[12715.20s -> 12726.75s]  was me was it a good job over there it was in the kill feed sorry dude there's
[12726.75s -> 12730.75s]  a lot going on and it's a huge arc and I think I may have hit you directly in the
[12730.75s -> 12736.61s]  back of like the spine you can't kill my healer only I can kill my healer but I
[12736.61s -> 12744.95s]  will bring you something nice because I did get some nice stuff yeah me too yeah
[12744.95s -> 12748.35s]  we're going back in there with the purples or you think we're gonna take
[12748.35s -> 12752.91s]  it easy of her own if I win with a purple I put it back in the box oh yeah
[12752.91s -> 12762.88s]  yeah you know I mean yeah back to graze for me well that's not necessarily true
[12762.88s -> 12770.09s]  oh you hear that oh I I have at least a cool shield for you I want to look at my
[12770.09s -> 12775.64s]  perks I have at least I have a cool shield and I've got cool boots for you
[12775.64s -> 12784.83s]  too you're gonna be just fine should I change from the AOE the PvE AOE to
[12784.83s -> 12794.58s]  different like player skill um the AOE is real the AOE heal is very good but I
[12794.58s -> 12799.58s]  don't know I don't really know cleric that well I can't really help you I don't
[12799.58s -> 12806.59s]  think the judge there's a judgment skill but it seems very specific like it looks
[12806.59s -> 12812.84s]  like reading the Terms of Service on the website because it says after focusing
[12812.84s -> 12817.84s]  for point five seconds immediately deal 35 magic damage and reduce targets
[12817.84s -> 12822.44s]  movement speed for two seconds but can only be cast when the crosshair targets
[12822.44s -> 12828.72s]  an enemy within four point five meters hmm yeah that sounds like a lot there's a
[12828.72s -> 12841.71s]  lot hmm I got boots for you I don't know if I want to take them I'm gonna okay
[12841.71s -> 12847.05s]  I'm keeping at least okay this is the new plan I want to keep some good shit
[12847.05s -> 12855.04s]  here I'll bring you these boots because this is gonna be good for you I'll bring
[12855.04s -> 12860.90s]  you this I have a blue pair of boots for you
[12861.10s -> 12865.02s]  and I have a nice shield with plus one attributes it's gonna be nice okay trying
[12865.02s -> 12872.38s]  to decide whether to do the PvE or PvP skill PvP is probably the way to go if
[12872.38s -> 12881.87s]  you're in a group of three oh you can also like not memorize spells and just
[12881.87s -> 12888.91s]  take two skills I guess yeah you can I think there's a weird way because it's
[12888.91s -> 12898.59s]  like the memory slots right mm-hmm yeah PvP is probably better not fine pants
[12898.59s -> 12904.05s]  not concerned about it someone said our PvP is terrible right after two of you
[12904.05s -> 12908.57s]  guys just made it out with purple items after killing multiple team groups I
[12908.57s -> 12913.93s]  mean that we we were the victor on at least three separate team fights there
[12913.93s -> 12916.33s]  were we not yeah I think we're doing just fine
[12916.33s -> 12930.64s]  everyone's voting for a derma throw oh actually you should take this ring to
[12930.64s -> 12935.48s]  this plus one spell capacity I'm actually gonna get because this is buff
[12935.48s -> 12941.56s]  durations too I don't know maybe you should take them both wait I got a I got
[12941.56s -> 12947.76s]  a necklace a piece for you to agility the jelly will help him a lot right I
[12948.32s -> 12955.15s]  know that's just moving speed now I'll keep that on for me the ring though it's
[12955.15s -> 12961.77s]  gonna help you with spell capacity and a little bit more strength I have an AOE
[12961.77s -> 12966.69s]  spell I'm feeling pretty good after that after the last one that was good yeah no
[12966.69s -> 12970.41s]  that was good we had that we actually did very well I'm happy with it oh there
[12970.41s -> 12978.90s]  is an AOE spell would you guys rather have I feel like I can't do both bless
[12978.90s -> 12983.02s]  and protection would you rather have 20 physical damage blocked or plus three to
[12983.02s -> 12991.15s]  strength agility and will for 30 seconds the idea I like the agility that
[12991.15s -> 12999.82s]  movement speed agility is movement speed and attack speed it's huge still I'm
[12999.82s -> 13011.17s]  going to give you these boots probably better for you magic pen versus item
[13011.17s -> 13014.73s]  equipped speed or magic pen this magic pen work for a clerk what would that do
[13014.73s -> 13030.12s]  um is that yes doesn't make your heels more potent casting agility on your
[13030.12s -> 13033.90s]  melee teammate makes them ten times better yeah I'm just gonna keep my load
[13033.90s -> 13040.32s]  out the way it is still learning the spells I have mm-hmm all right you guys
[13040.32s -> 13049.77s]  ready mm-hmm oh yeah go for it doing it do a high
[13049.77s -> 13058.05s]  roll around dude oh thanks poke just carried us through that he's got this

[13890.93s -> 13894.65s]  you want a quarter stuff do you like using it right now um I wouldn't mind
[13894.65s -> 13897.77s]  like trying it out yeah cuz I don't really not really using the shield right
[13897.77s -> 13905.87s]  now I don't need it to this round but yeah you should give it a shot oh press
[13905.87s -> 13917.26s]  the wrong button the pendant is worth 500 gold easy yeah maybe put that in your
[13917.26s -> 13921.78s]  stash yeah that's in that's in the snatch honestly that's that's one of the best
[13921.78s -> 13925.10s]  items I think I've seen so far for playing it's just it's all about stats
[13925.10s -> 13929.82s]  especially the just having plus three to all stats it's just it does is a cracked
[13929.82s -> 13936.08s]  item save that for the next two days and then in the last day equip it and
[13936.08s -> 13947.24s]  just run into a fucking door let me just I'm gonna bring this for you get rid of
[13947.24s -> 13956.20s]  this other stuff molotovs are actually kind of fun I'll keep it you just sell
[13956.20s -> 13967.46s]  all gemstones yeah that's it's just for money what about what about you said
[13967.46s -> 13971.72s]  candy is important can't so go to merchants and go all the way the right
[13971.72s -> 13984.08s]  top right Valentine it's all purples oh oh it's a currency it's a currency and I
[13984.12s -> 13990.09s]  just found the weapon that I'm going to use and not use to put it in the
[13990.09s -> 13999.92s]  inventory holy shit it's a purple longsword I just used my candy I've been
[13999.92s -> 14004.96s]  saving it but yeah this is really good shit there it's just like a good way to
[14004.96s -> 14009.71s]  get a purple over time though those little candies the little hard candies
[14009.71s -> 14015.15s]  they're kind of hard to find they're not like common yeah it just seems like an
[14015.15s -> 14027.03s]  exchange for epic okay kind of filling out here so you're gonna bring the the
[14027.03s -> 14033.49s]  staff yes I'll bring the core stuff for you okay I'm gonna look at my spells
[14033.49s -> 14061.41s]  again I do want to buy okay pants pants pants I yeah I will the eight so the AOE
[14061.41s -> 14065.49s]  healed that won't heal enemy players right or will it oh yeah I will it will
[14065.49s -> 14073.30s]  be real friendly beings but they may they're not friendly you know use the
[14073.30s -> 14077.58s]  purple sword no no and when I lose this I might if for it to heal them I think
[14077.58s -> 14082.81s]  that they should have to say I'm friendly yeah in proximity yeah that was
[14082.81s -> 14090.68s]  a good round though we actually that we did we played very well it's a six cost
[14090.68s -> 14106.31s]  is the problem ooh maybe maybe get rid of weapon damage it's hard to cast all
[14106.31s -> 14109.91s]  the buffs at the same time like it's priority is this thing's fucking awesome
[14109.91s -> 14121.39s]  too we got protection bless and divine strike did you like the bar ditch the
[14121.43s -> 14126.87s]  the big axe yeah did you like using the bar ditch I don't remember using it
[14126.87s -> 14129.31s]  really I'm not on your barbarian I'm thinking
[14129.31s -> 14133.75s]  jerk do you like the bar do you like barges you can't hear you right now
[14133.75s -> 14145.52s]  bless is the weakest I'll buy this one I want to get confirmation because I will
[14145.52s -> 14157.32s]  buy it and he just pay me back like he'll just drop 160 gold from me you
[14157.32s -> 14161.16s]  have to give up so much to get sanctuary and the other I guess you can get rid of
[14161.16s -> 14171.48s]  the thick heel but then that's the best one for PvP like it's too expensive it
[14171.48s -> 14180.62s]  is very expensive sanctuary is a six cost another raid there's another raid
[14180.62s -> 14189.12s]  from beta 64 also dag nail earlier to thanks welcome welcome Raiders here
[14189.12s -> 14194.23s]  there's the balls that's what just happened to the guy with the spider want
[14194.23s -> 14201.63s]  to see the clip his perspective really sad yeah I actually I got a great view
[14201.63s -> 14207.06s]  of it I was sitting there just watching the whole time I'm gonna go with this I
[14207.06s -> 14215.54s]  had like a cinematic view of that whole scenario yeah there's also a
[14215.54s -> 14224.19s]  resurrection spell it's true there is it is a cost Wow so that would be two
[14224.19s -> 14238.27s]  thirds of my spell memory with no extra gear helping no way it was a real
[14238.27s -> 14243.50s]  terrific moment so in another couple levels Alex you're gonna be able to get
[14243.50s -> 14248.18s]  a another perk yeah the second one will be nice because right now it's just
[14248.38s -> 14257.46s]  there's some good ones yeah I can get as drunk as I want with no detrimental
[14257.46s -> 14266.42s]  side effects I wonder what happens when you drink booze in this game like pain
[14266.42s -> 14272.42s]  oh okay so that's right people do like brewmaster clerk because if I drink then
[14272.42s -> 14277.02s]  my screen gets all fucked up and it's hard to swing you are not affected by
[14277.02s -> 14281.10s]  drunkenness in the game so you could effectively just buy like a shitload of
[14281.10s -> 14285.62s]  booze and just be pounding it and just get only the stat bonus when you want it
[14285.66s -> 14291.51s]  and not the negative people do brewmaster clerk bonus is good yeah it's
[14291.51s -> 14294.75s]  like plus 10 strength or something or plus 15 agility it's something like
[14294.75s -> 14309.38s]  that it's huge people do it I think you're committing to melee cleric at
[14309.38s -> 14316.28s]  that point right and beer is very cheap yeah so if you wanted to put like a mace
[14316.28s -> 14321.88s]  on and really not really cast many spells and just drink potions get plus
[14321.88s -> 14329.94s]  10 strength and just go absolutely crazy you could your increases strength HP
[14329.98s -> 14337.89s]  damage etc our strength increases HP damage yeah yeah it's HP and image
[14337.89s -> 14359.92s]  look I'm staff do wielding oh nice dual welding yeah dude aim for the head why
[14359.92s -> 14369.38s]  didn't anyone tell me that like the first thing I told you all right this is

[17581.54s -> 17588.09s]  punished for not having an offensive perk you had when you died you were in
[17588.09s -> 17592.01s]  there and you did kind of like a long jump like the Olympic style like both
[17592.01s -> 17596.65s]  your legs went out as if you're just getting pure maximum distance somebody

[18487.91s -> 18495.11s]  everyone we could have killed that boss we could have killed it we killed the
[18495.11s -> 18498.47s]  way of escaping alive so the rate didn't have anything did it even have like a
[18498.47s -> 18504.57s]  green it had a green cleric chest which I'm gonna bring for you I'm just
[18504.57s -> 18522.80s]  whispering now I got three of these you know it's really funny I was just being
[18522.80s -> 18528.84s]  stuck and lost in that space is what made us able to live and leave because we
[18528.84s -> 18534.36s]  were like everyone else was dead I think everybody else is dead literally
[18534.36s -> 18539.45s]  everybody because you meant you commented on how the kill feed yeah was
[18539.45s -> 18553.26s]  very busy that's exactly what happened almost 400 gold on Jerv mmm nice anyone
[18553.26s -> 18562.76s]  want a present I do like I got you a rope I might let's go long so actually
[18562.76s -> 18571.28s]  you need a rope because my best one I lost when the one before this about you
[18571.28s -> 18575.72s]  need you want a present I'm going kind of try hard mode this time I'm putting
[18575.72s -> 18582.55s]  on a good sword really good pants bunch of heels I got a right I got a pretty
[18582.55s -> 18590.81s]  decent setup keeping the boys alive I am a loot goblin or whoever wants to kill
[18590.81s -> 18597.01s]  me but I think it's time to go for a try hard one let me see if there's
[18597.01s -> 18613.68s]  anything better I can buy no much let's see I've almost got 300 gold that's good
[18613.68s -> 18622.40s]  that's a good start that's pretty good almost as much as Jerv I have 750 I had
[18622.40s -> 18634.69s]  almost a thousand playing some support okay so there's like gear that lets you
[18634.69s -> 18644.51s]  memorize more spells there is because that would be pretty sweet you guys want
[18644.55s -> 18657.28s]  to go down to the under area the under area yeah yeah we should if we spawn
[18657.28s -> 18667.28s]  near it hmm see like sanctuary would have been awesome for that last
[18667.28s -> 18676.24s]  encounter I mean we did pretty good we managed agro on two different bosses yeah
[18676.24s -> 18679.84s]  it was pretty good yeah it was pretty good by the way I yes I'm doing the
[18679.84s -> 18702.52s]  swords by height so relax I'm bringing a drink for you just because I it's been
[18702.52s -> 18716.45s]  in my inventory for like a week all right how is everybody doing sure it's
[18716.45s -> 18724.86s]  good yeah why not buy money bags um I could but I don't I mean there's no
[18724.86s -> 18729.64s]  reason to have them right now until I get more gear I'd rather just keep the
[18729.64s -> 18733.56s]  money it's five bucks per bag right why would I spend five bucks when I don't
[18733.56s -> 18742.30s]  even look at I got all this empty space it looks nicer I like the gold coins I
[18742.30s -> 18752.27s]  think looks cool all right we good to go uh everybody ready it oh ripple you have
[18752.27s -> 18758.27s]  another perk to put on oh yeah level 5 you get another perk uh I actually put
[18758.27s -> 18762.67s]  one on yeah oh yeah damage reduction in a small after that encounter where I
[18762.67s -> 18768.18s]  died I put the like five percent bonus damage I don't know if that's enough but
[18768.18s -> 18784.40s]  you're pretty good to win the next fight okay let me just let's go for it how
[18784.40s -> 18792.33s]  many charges of sanctuary do you get I I don't know is it more than one in my
[18792.33s -> 18796.80s]  because it's a really really amazing heal to just a gigantic AOE heal you get
[18796.80s -> 18805.51s]  to probably get rid of the light heal hmm but I've been enjoying running what
[18805.51s -> 18810.73s]  I've got so far it's been working we're staying alive we are staying alive and
[18810.73s -> 18815.57s]  I've got really good gear on so I'm going to try this round I'm not gonna do

[19602.65s -> 19607.21s]  darker but I went into the options and it did a turn screen brightness up and
[19607.21s -> 19611.53s]  brighter I see I put I literally put it up all the way and no one's seen that
[19611.53s -> 19614.89s]  yet but you know what I don't even care if you see it bright and brighter kind
[19614.89s -> 19624.13s]  of yeah ah that's good to know yeah it's in the game it's not met it's not
[19624.13s -> 19628.18s]  fucking with anything it's in the game the developers have put it in there so I
[19628.18s -> 19635.06s]  put it up all the way I see yep so unless they take that out in the game
[19635.06s -> 19651.34s]  people saying omega low high settings high settings yeah because I mean on
[19651.34s -> 19661.54s]  epic I think I get little frame drops I'm gonna roll with the same thing I

[22115.31s -> 22119.76s]  groups part of the reason too that I had the three groups kind of blocked out
[22119.76s -> 22126.19s]  is to try to jump around so I'm not looking I've got a group so I'm not
[22126.19s -> 22140.87s]  like really looking for one I think this is clean offline okay I was like who is
[22140.87s -> 22148.66s]  this in the lobby right now sure I'm gonna exit I'm kind of scared that if I
[22148.66s -> 22159.74s]  don't then the same problem is gonna happen it's gonna restart the game
[22159.74s -> 22173.77s]  does anyone know how this runs on DX 11 because there's an option to start it
[22173.77s -> 22184.42s]  with dips DX 11 I imagine it's probably not very good you know it's so weird
[22184.46s -> 22190.37s]  about all the new graphics all the new DirectX versions it feels like
[22190.37s -> 22200.36s]  everything after DX 10 just kind of sucks is that weird to say like
[22200.36s -> 22205.95s]  everything I feel like it's all kind of broken after like 10 or 11 like it's
[22205.95s -> 22209.99s]  like oh yeah you could you could run it on like DX 12 but or DX 11 but don't do
[22209.99s -> 22222.66s]  that oh here we go I'm getting in fly like an eagle that was beautiful to come

[22865.24s -> 22868.64s]  should probably leave to make sure I get out because I want to and we're getting
[22868.64s -> 22875.80s]  shot at so go ahead and get out of here I have his entire loadout so yes thank
[22875.80s -> 22882.72s]  God cuz I wasn't ready for those traps oh my god is that fart smeller yeah

[22892.97s -> 22898.15s]  well but I don't know if I believe in a 1v3 that's a tight that's it that's a
[22898.15s -> 22913.31s]  tough tight scenario yeah I do believe in you will leave but I wonder they
[22913.35s -> 22921.82s]  might be fighting that might be two different teams it doesn't tell me how
[22921.82s -> 22929.66s]  you how many are left right I think where the timer is counting down I think
[22929.66s -> 22934.34s]  that's the amount of people that are still here the gray right the gray
[22934.34s -> 22939.78s]  notches oh I don't know no the gray notches are how much time is left oh I've
[22939.78s -> 22945.78s]  been reading that completely wrong for a whole fucking week it's like the entire
[22945.78s -> 22950.34s]  lobby is alive this circle is so small I can't believe I got that right actually
[22950.34s -> 22954.65s]  a whole week thought it was notches for people I have a feeling they're gonna

[22970.91s -> 22984.08s]  Rachel I think they moved in you think they dipped they might be dead I mean I
[22984.08s -> 22992.30s]  don't hear anybody I think they were just kind of murdering their way through

[23267.95s -> 23274.55s]  like really weird it's like this very slow traveling orb there's one that

[23327.24s -> 23332.66s]  school D&D stuff they're adding more classes to I think right yeah they're
[23332.66s -> 23343.64s]  adding the bard that's gonna be wild I just need you guys the front line get

[23438.50s -> 23442.46s]  you otherwise you burn so many consumables trying to get back to full
[23442.46s -> 23452.70s]  health efficiency indeed indeed this game is cool this game is so fun it's way
[23452.70s -> 23461.61s]  funner with people I played solo the first night I played it and I think I
[23461.61s -> 23466.69s]  lost 95 I played probably 20 to 30 games and I lost every single one I won like
[23466.69s -> 23471.80s]  maybe two out of like the 30 I bled all right this has been looted but they
[23471.80s -> 23476.48s]  didn't kill this area for some reason so be really careful because if they get up
[23476.48s -> 23482.64s]  top it's really hard to win a fight in here all right we got the mage oh red
[23482.64s -> 23490.89s]  skeleton you play rogue or something it's a little easier I don't like this

[25609.51s -> 25615.74s]  by the fucking skeleton and it was like a one-shot it was he didn't even get a
